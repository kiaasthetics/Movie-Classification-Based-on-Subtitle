4,"00:01:28,673","00:01:32,343",I'm coming to get you.
5,"00:01:33,636","00:01:36,681","Where are you, you little rascal?
I'm coming to get you."
6,"00:01:38,766","00:01:41,477",Where is my little birthday girl?
7,"00:01:42,687","00:01:45,648","I'm going to gobble her
up when I find her."
8,"00:01:47,567","00:01:49,527",I'm going to eat you. I am.
9,"00:01:52,363","00:01:54,949","Fergus, no weapons on the table."
10,"00:01:55,033","00:01:57,327","Can I shoot an arrow? Can I?
Can I? Can I? Can I?"
11,"00:01:57,410","00:01:59,704",Please? Can I?
12,"00:01:59,787","00:02:02,790",Not with that. Why not
13,"00:02:02,874","00:02:04,208",use your very own?
14,"00:02:05,293","00:02:07,628","Happy birthday, my wee darling!"
15,"00:02:11,466","00:02:13,509","Now, there's a good girl."
16,"00:02:13,593","00:02:16,179","Draw all the way back now to your cheek.
That's right."
17,"00:02:17,472","00:02:19,474",Keep both eyes open.
18,"00:02:20,141","00:02:22,310","And, loose!"
19,"00:02:24,395","00:02:26,731","- I missed
- Go and fetch it, then."
20,"00:02:28,900","00:02:32,028","A bow, Fergus? She's a lady."
21,"00:02:32,945","00:02:33,988",You!
22,"00:03:11,401","00:03:12,443",A will-o'- the-wisp.
23,"00:03:20,743","00:03:22,870",They are real.
24,"00:03:30,545","00:03:33,339","Merida, come along, sweetheart."
25,"00:03:33,506","00:03:35,675","- We're leaving now.
- I saw a wisp."
26,"00:03:37,677","00:03:39,762","- I saw a wisp.
- A wisp?"
27,"00:03:39,846","00:03:45,184","You know, some say that will-o'- the-wisps
lead you to your fate."
28,"00:03:45,268","00:03:47,728",Aye. Or an arrow.
29,"00:03:47,812","00:03:50,815","Come on, let's be off before
we see a dancing Tatty Bogle."
30,"00:03:51,274","00:03:53,317","Or a giant having a
jigger in the bluebells."
31,"00:03:53,401","00:03:55,278",Your father doesn't believe in magic.
32,"00:03:55,361","00:03:57,822","Well, he should. Because it's true."
33,"00:04:00,825","00:04:02,535","Mor'du! Elinor, run!"
34,"00:04:03,119","00:04:04,829",Sire!
35,"00:04:13,254","00:04:14,338","Come on, you!"
36,"00:04:27,852","00:04:30,980","Some say our destiny
is tied to the land"
37,"00:04:32,023","00:04:34,567",as much a pan' of us as we are of it.
38,"00:04:37,862","00:04:41,699","Others say fate is woven
together like a cloth."
39,"00:04:43,201","00:04:46,537","So that one's destiny
intertwines with many others."
40,"00:04:50,750","00:04:55,546","It's the one thing we search
for or fight to change."
41,"00:04:57,048","00:04:59,133",Some never find it.
42,"00:05:01,594","00:05:04,722",But there are some who are led.
43,"00:05:10,394","00:05:12,480",The story of how my father lost his leg
44,"00:05:13,564","00:05:14,899","to the demon bear
Mor'du became legend."
45,"00:05:18,236","00:05:20,821","I became a sister to
three new brothers."
46,"00:05:20,905","00:05:24,158","The princes. Hamish,
Hubert and Harris."
47,"00:05:24,575","00:05:26,953","Wee devils, more like."
48,"00:05:27,036","00:05:28,538",They get away with murder.
49,"00:05:29,664","00:05:31,916",I can never get away with anything.
50,"00:05:33,793","00:05:35,795",I'm the princess.
51,"00:05:37,547","00:05:39,549",I'm the example.
52,"00:05:41,425","00:05:44,595","I've got duties,
responsibilities, expectations."
53,"00:05:44,679","00:05:46,472","My whole life is planned out,"
54,"00:05:46,556","00:05:47,890",preparing for the day I become...
55,"00:05:48,432","00:05:50,017","Well, my mother."
56,"00:05:50,101","00:05:53,437","She's in charge of every
single day of my life."

thou shalt know of mine. """

62,"00:06:08,452","00:06:11,289","- This is all for naught.
- I heard that!"
63,"00:06:11,372","00:06:12,498",From the top.
64,"00:06:12,582","00:06:15,710","A princess must be knowledgeable
about her kingdom."
65,"00:06:17,128","00:06:19,171",She does not doodle.
66,"00:06:21,799","00:06:23,801","That's a C, dear."
67,"00:06:29,974","00:06:32,476",A princess does not chortle.

73,"00:06:40,985","00:06:47,992","And above all, a princess strives for...
Well, perfection."
74,"00:06:49,368","00:06:51,162","But every once in a while,"
75,"00:06:51,829","00:06:56,417","there's a day when I don't
have to be a princess."
76,"00:06:58,336","00:07:01,047","No lessons, no expectations."
77,"00:07:01,172","00:07:03,507",A day where anything can happen.
78,"00:07:05,092","00:07:08,095",A day I can change my fate.
79,"00:09:10,217","00:09:13,512","I'm starving. You hungry too, Angus?"
80,"00:09:15,055","00:09:17,016","Oats it is, then."
81,"00:09:19,226","00:09:20,895","Good day, Princess."
82,"00:09:20,978","00:09:22,855","I cannot find the salt.
Where did you put it?"
83,"00:09:22,938","00:09:25,191","It was over there a minute ago,
the last time I looked at it."
84,"00:09:25,941","00:09:30,905","And then, out of nowhere, the
biggest bear you've ever seen!"
85,"00:09:30,988","00:09:33,949","His hide littered with the
weapons of fallen warriors."
86,"00:09:34,033","00:09:37,661",His face scarred with one dead eye.
87,"00:09:38,621","00:09:40,206",I drew my sword and...
88,"00:09:41,332","00:09:44,084","One swipe, his sword shattered."
89,"00:09:44,168","00:09:47,296","Then ""chomp""! Dad's leg was clean off."
90,"00:09:47,671","00:09:49,965",Down the monster's throat it went.
91,"00:09:50,049","00:09:52,968",That's my favorite part.
92,"00:09:53,052","00:09:56,722","Mor'du has never been seen since,"
93,"00:09:56,806","00:10:01,977","and is roaming the wilds
waiting his chance of revenge."
94,"00:10:03,270","00:10:04,522",Let him return.
95,"00:10:04,605","00:10:06,315","I'll finish what I guddled
in the first place."
96,"00:10:06,732","00:10:10,444","Merida, a princess does not
place her weapons on the table."
97,"00:10:10,528","00:10:13,781",Mum! It's just my bow.
98,"00:10:13,864","00:10:16,826","A princess should not have
weapons in my opinion."
99,"00:10:16,909","00:10:18,369",Leave her be.
100,"00:10:18,536","00:10:21,205","Princess or not, learning
to fight is essential."
101,"00:10:21,539","00:10:24,083","Mum? You'll never guess
what I did today."
102,"00:10:24,458","00:10:26,460","I climbed the Crone's Tooth,"
103,"00:10:26,544","00:10:27,878",and drank from the Fire Falls.
104,"00:10:28,420","00:10:29,797",Fire Falls?
105,"00:10:29,880","00:10:33,676","They say only the ancient kings were
brave enough to drink the fire."
106,"00:10:34,802","00:10:37,805","- What did you do, dear?
- Nothing, Mum."
107,"00:10:37,888","00:10:39,139","Hungry, aren't we?"
108,"00:10:39,223","00:10:41,600","- Mum!
- You'll get dreadful collywobbles."
109,"00:10:41,684","00:10:44,687","Oh, Fergus, will you look
at your daughter's plate?"
110,"00:10:45,354","00:10:46,689",So what?
111,"00:10:46,772","00:10:49,316","- You great...
- Don't let them lick..."
112,"00:10:49,400","00:10:50,651","Boys, you're naughty."
113,"00:10:50,734","00:10:52,820",Don't just play with your haggis.
114,"00:10:53,821","00:10:55,823","How do you know you don't like it,"
115,"00:10:55,906","00:10:57,992",if you won't try it?
116,"00:10:58,075","00:10:59,910",That's just a wee sheep's stomach.
117,"00:11:00,160","00:11:01,704",It's delicious.
118,"00:11:02,580","00:11:04,915","- My lady.
- Thank you, Maudie."
119,"00:11:05,082","00:11:06,250","You're getting too big, the two of you."
120,"00:11:12,339","00:11:14,675","From the Lords Macintosh,
MacGuffin and Dingwall."
121,"00:11:14,758","00:11:16,135","Their responses, no doubt."
122,"00:11:16,218","00:11:17,720","Aye, aye!"
123,"00:11:17,803","00:11:19,805","Hey, hey!"
124,"00:11:20,681","00:11:23,350","Stay out of my food,
you greedy mongrels."
125,"00:11:24,018","00:11:26,145","Chew on that, you manky dogs!"
126,"00:11:27,229","00:11:28,397",Fergus?
127,"00:11:30,566","00:11:32,109",They've all accepted.
128,"00:11:34,653","00:11:36,989","Who's accepted what, Mother?"
129,"00:11:37,072","00:11:39,283","Boys, you are excused."
130,"00:11:43,787","00:11:45,164",Hey!
131,"00:11:45,998","00:11:49,001",What did I do now?
132,"00:11:49,084","00:11:51,420","Your father has something
to discuss with you."
133,"00:11:53,797","00:11:54,882",Fergus?
134,"00:12:01,889","00:12:03,390",Merida.
135,"00:12:06,310","00:12:11,065","The lords are presenting their sons
as suitors for your betrothal."
136,"00:12:11,148","00:12:13,984","- What?
- The clans have accepted."
137,"00:12:14,526","00:12:16,987","- Dad!
- What? I..."
138,"00:12:17,196","00:12:19,406",You... She... Elinor?
139,"00:12:19,490","00:12:21,992","Honestly, Merida, I don't know
why you're reacting this way."
140,"00:12:22,868","00:12:24,995","This year, each clan
will present a suitor"
141,"00:12:25,245","00:12:27,164",to compete in the games for your hand.
142,"00:12:27,456","00:12:30,084","I suppose a princess just
does what she's told?"
143,"00:12:30,167","00:12:32,711",A princess does not raise her voice.
144,"00:12:33,253","00:12:36,298","Merida, this is what you've been
preparing for your whole life."
145,"00:12:36,840","00:12:40,260","No, it's what you've been
preparing me for my whole life."
146,"00:12:40,344","00:12:42,596","I won't go through with it.
You can't make me."
147,"00:12:42,680","00:12:44,807",Merida!
148,"00:12:46,016","00:12:47,601",Merida!
149,"00:12:50,771","00:12:53,023",Boys!
150,"00:12:57,194","00:13:00,906",Mother. Suitors? Marriage?
151,"00:13:00,990","00:13:03,409",Once there was an ancient kingdom...
152,"00:13:03,617","00:13:06,036",Mum!
153,"00:13:06,120","00:13:07,705",Ancient kingdom.
154,"00:13:07,788","00:13:09,832","Its name long forgotten,"
155,"00:13:10,624","00:13:14,461","ruled by a wise and fair
king who was much beloved."
156,"00:13:14,962","00:13:19,967","And when he grew old he divided
the kingdom among his four sons,"
157,"00:13:20,050","00:13:24,430","that they should be the pillars on
which the peace of the land rested."
158,"00:13:25,681","00:13:30,811","But the oldest prince wanted
to rule the land for himself."
159,"00:13:30,894","00:13:34,481","He followed his own path
and the kingdom fell"
160,"00:13:35,691","00:13:38,652","to war, and chaos and ruin."
161,"00:13:38,736","00:13:40,529",That's a nice story.
162,"00:13:40,612","00:13:43,490","It's not just a story, Merida."
163,"00:13:43,574","00:13:46,243","Legends are lessons.
They ring with truths."
164,"00:13:46,577","00:13:47,661",Mum.
165,"00:13:47,745","00:13:49,913","I would advise you to make
your peace with this."
166,"00:13:49,997","00:13:51,874","The clans are coming to
present their suitors."
167,"00:13:51,957","00:13:54,418","- It's not fair.
- Merida."
168,"00:13:54,585","00:13:57,337","It's marriage. It's not
the end of the world."
169,"00:14:05,929","00:14:08,640","- You're muttering.
- I don't mutter."
170,"00:14:09,266","00:14:12,519","Aye, you do. You mutter, lass,
when something's troubling you."
171,"00:14:12,603","00:14:14,688",I blame you. Stubbornness.
172,"00:14:14,772","00:14:17,357",It's entirely from your side of the family.
173,"00:14:17,441","00:14:19,443","I take it the talk didn't
go too well, then?"
174,"00:14:20,652","00:14:22,112",I don't know what to do.
175,"00:14:22,196","00:14:25,199","- Speak to her, dear.
- I do speak to her."
176,"00:14:25,282","00:14:28,577","- She just doesn't listen.
- Come on, now."
177,"00:14:28,827","00:14:31,038",Pretend I'm Merida. Speak to me.
178,"00:14:31,121","00:14:32,122",What would you say?
179,"00:14:34,333","00:14:35,709",I can't do this.
180,"00:14:35,793","00:14:37,461",Sure you can.
181,"00:14:38,087","00:14:40,130","There, there. That's my queen."
182,"00:14:40,214","00:14:42,674","Right, here we go."
183,"00:14:42,758","00:14:43,967","""I don't want to get married. """
184,"00:14:44,051","00:14:46,512","""I want to stay single and
let my hair flow in the wind"""
185,"00:14:46,595","00:14:51,058","""as I ride through the glen

186,"00:14:56,105","00:15:00,901","Merida, all this work, all the
time spent preparing you,"
187,"00:15:00,984","00:15:04,905","schooling you, giving you
everything we never had."
188,"00:15:04,988","00:15:08,325","I ask you, what do you expect us to do?"
189,"00:15:08,408","00:15:11,495","Call off the gathering.
Would that kill them?"
190,"00:15:11,578","00:15:12,913",You're the queen.
191,"00:15:12,996","00:15:16,291","You can just tell the lords the
princess is not ready for this."
192,"00:15:16,375","00:15:20,129","In fact, she might not ever be
ready for this, so that's that."
193,"00:15:20,212","00:15:24,216","Good day to you. We'll expect your
declarations of war in the morning."
194,"00:15:24,299","00:15:27,928",I understand this must all seem unfair.
195,"00:15:28,011","00:15:30,389","Even I had reservations
when I faced betrothal."
196,"00:15:30,889","00:15:33,892","But we can't just run
away from who we are."
197,"00:15:33,976","00:15:36,603",I don't want my life to be over.
198,"00:15:36,687","00:15:37,938",I want my freedom!
199,"00:15:38,021","00:15:41,358","But are you willing to pay the
price your freedom will cost?"
200,"00:15:41,483","00:15:43,485",I'm not doing any of this to hurt you.
201,"00:15:43,569","00:15:49,074","If you could just try to see
what I do, I do out of love."
202,"00:15:49,158","00:15:52,119","But it's my life, it's..."
203,"00:15:52,369","00:15:54,288",I'm just not ready.
204,"00:15:54,371","00:15:56,248","I think you'd see, if you could just..."
205,"00:15:56,331","00:15:59,459","I think I could make you
understand if you would just..."
206,"00:15:59,543","00:16:01,044","...listen.
- ... listen."
207,"00:16:04,381","00:16:07,551","I swear, Angus, this
isn't going to happen."
208,"00:16:08,552","00:16:10,179",Not if I have any say in it.
209,"00:16:26,904","00:16:30,073",MacGuffin!
210,"00:16:32,868","00:16:34,870","- Dingwall!
- Dingwall!"
211,"00:16:36,705","00:16:39,625","- Macintosh!
- Macintosh!"
212,"00:16:52,512","00:16:55,974",You look absolutely beautiful.
213,"00:16:56,058","00:16:57,559",I can't breathe.
214,"00:16:57,643","00:16:59,645",Shush! Give us a turn.
215,"00:17:01,772","00:17:03,315",I can't move.
216,"00:17:03,398","00:17:05,442",It's too tight.
217,"00:17:07,110","00:17:08,320",It's perfect.
218,"00:17:20,666","00:17:23,210","- Merida?
- Mum?"
219,"00:17:26,129","00:17:28,131",Just...
220,"00:17:30,759","00:17:33,011",Remember to smile.
221,"00:17:47,276","00:17:48,527","Aye, they're coming."
222,"00:17:48,610","00:17:51,113","Places, everyone. Places."
223,"00:18:07,754","00:18:10,340","I look fine, woman! Leave me be!"
224,"00:18:10,674","00:18:12,009",My Lord!
225,"00:18:12,092","00:18:15,304","I want to announce the
arrival of the lords..."
226,"00:18:15,387","00:18:17,431",Who goes there? Who goes there?
227,"00:18:34,156","00:18:36,158",Boy!
228,"00:18:46,335","00:18:49,254","So, here we are,"
229,"00:18:50,047","00:18:52,215","- The four clans.
- Aye."
230,"00:18:52,799","00:18:54,801",Gathering...
231,"00:18:55,469","00:18:57,054",...for...
232,"00:18:57,137","00:19:00,891","...the presentation of the suitors.
- ... the presentation of the suitors."
233,"00:19:02,059","00:19:03,643",Clan Macintosh.
234,"00:19:03,727","00:19:05,979",Macintosh!
235,"00:19:06,063","00:19:09,733","Your Majesty, I present
my heir and scion,"
236,"00:19:09,816","00:19:13,236","who defended our land from
the northern invaders,"
237,"00:19:13,320","00:19:17,491","and with his own sword, Stab Blooder,"
238,"00:19:17,574","00:19:19,993","vanquished 1,000 foes."
239,"00:19:20,077","00:19:22,079",Macintosh!
240,"00:19:23,413","00:19:24,956",Clan MacGuffin!
241,"00:19:25,040","00:19:26,708",MacGuffin!
242,"00:19:27,501","00:19:32,130","Good Majesty, I present my eldest son,"
243,"00:19:32,214","00:19:34,633",who scuttled the Viking longships
244,"00:19:34,716","00:19:39,429","and with his bare hands
vanquished 2,000 foes."
245,"00:19:39,679","00:19:41,681",MacGuffin!
246,"00:19:44,434","00:19:45,811",Clan Dingwall.
247,"00:19:45,977","00:19:47,270",Dingwall!
248,"00:19:48,814","00:19:51,983",I present my only son
249,"00:19:53,443","00:19:57,572","who was besieged by 10,000 Romans"
250,"00:19:58,115","00:20:01,910","and he took out a whole
armada singlehandedly."
251,"00:20:01,993","00:20:03,620","With one arm, he was..."
252,"00:20:04,746","00:20:07,416",With one arm he was steering the ship
253,"00:20:07,499","00:20:10,627","and with the other he
held his mighty sword"
254,"00:20:10,710","00:20:13,422",and struck down a whole attacking fleet.
255,"00:20:13,505","00:20:15,882","- Lies!
- What? I heard that."
256,"00:20:16,133","00:20:18,135",Go on. Say it to my face.
257,"00:20:18,635","00:20:21,221","Or are ye scared,
simpering jackanapes,"
258,"00:20:21,304","00:20:23,432",afraid to muss your pretty hair?
259,"00:20:23,515","00:20:26,768","- At least we have hair.
- And all our teeth."
260,"00:20:26,852","00:20:29,312",If he was a wee bit closer...
261,"00:20:31,189","00:20:35,026","And we don't hide under
bridges, you grumpy old troll."
262,"00:20:38,321","00:20:40,449","You want to laugh, huh?"
263,"00:20:40,740","00:20:42,659",Wee Dingwall!
264,"00:20:44,703","00:20:46,121",Get off me!
265,"00:20:57,757","00:21:00,594",Nut 'em! Nut 'em! That's the way to...
266,"00:21:02,345","00:21:03,513",All right.
267,"00:21:05,474","00:21:06,892",Shut it!
268,"00:21:09,227","00:21:14,065","Now, that's all done. You've
had your go at each other."
269,"00:21:14,191","00:21:15,942",Show a little decorum.
270,"00:21:16,902","00:21:18,945",And no more fighting.
271,"00:21:52,270","00:21:54,439",You want a fresh one?
272,"00:22:00,403","00:22:01,446","Crivens, you're fierce."
273,"00:22:01,530","00:22:02,864",I didn't start it. It was...
274,"00:22:02,948","00:22:05,617","My lady Queen, I feel terrible.
My humblest apologies."
275,"00:22:05,700","00:22:09,287","- We mean no disrespect.
- I'm sorry, love, I didn't... But..."
276,"00:22:09,371","00:22:11,498","Yes, dear."
277,"00:22:11,581","00:22:13,333","Now, where were we?"
278,"00:22:13,416","00:22:17,087","Yes. In accordance with our laws,"
279,"00:22:17,170","00:22:19,589","by the rights of our heritage,"
280,"00:22:19,714","00:22:22,968","only the firstborn of
each of the great leaders"
281,"00:22:23,051","00:22:26,137","may be presented as champion.
- Firstborn?"
282,"00:22:26,221","00:22:31,184","And thus compete for the hand
of the Princess of Dun Broch."
283,"00:22:31,268","00:22:34,938","To win the fair maiden they
must prove their worth"
284,"00:22:35,021","00:22:38,817","by feats of strength
or arms in the games."
285,"00:22:38,900","00:22:43,488","It is customary that the challenge be
determined by the princess herself."
286,"00:22:43,572","00:22:45,282",Archery! Archery.
287,"00:22:47,784","00:22:51,580",I choose archery.
288,"00:22:52,330","00:22:55,500",Let the games begin!
289,"00:23:15,812","00:23:17,355",Pull!
290,"00:23:18,023","00:23:19,858",Pull!
291,"00:23:36,583","00:23:38,293",I'll just take one.
292,"00:23:45,091","00:23:48,511","Now, I have told you,
you're not allowed..."
293,"00:24:09,866","00:24:11,242",It's time!
294,"00:24:13,870","00:24:17,207","- Archers, to your marks!
- Aye, archers to your marks."
295,"00:24:17,290","00:24:19,959",And may the lucky arrow find its target.
296,"00:24:30,387","00:24:32,222",Oi! Get on with it.
297,"00:24:43,274","00:24:45,735",I bet he wishes he was tossing cabers.
298,"00:24:45,819","00:24:48,738",Or holding up bridges.
299,"00:24:56,413","00:24:59,833","At least you hit the target, son."
300,"00:25:01,543","00:25:03,044",That's attractive.
301,"00:25:06,756","00:25:08,925","- I got it!
- Good arm."
302,"00:25:09,008","00:25:12,220",And such lovely flowing locks.
303,"00:25:12,303","00:25:13,680","- Fergus.
- What?"
304,"00:25:22,939","00:25:24,607",Wee lamb.
305,"00:25:30,280","00:25:32,741","Come on! Shoot, boy!"
306,"00:25:36,077","00:25:37,954","Well done, lad! Well done."
307,"00:25:41,458","00:25:43,626",Feast your eyes!
308,"00:25:44,252","00:25:46,963",That's my boy.
309,"00:25:47,464","00:25:51,259","Well, that's just grand now, isn't it?"
310,"00:25:51,342","00:25:53,803","- Guess who's coming to dinner?
- Fergus."
311,"00:25:53,928","00:25:57,015","By the way, hope you don't
mind being called Lady..."
312,"00:26:04,939","00:26:06,775",I am Merida.
313,"00:26:06,858","00:26:10,445","Firstborn descendant
of Clan Dun Broch."
314,"00:26:10,528","00:26:13,698",And I'll be shooting for my own hand.
315,"00:26:15,575","00:26:17,994",What are you doing?
316,"00:26:20,914","00:26:22,874",Merida!
317,"00:26:22,957","00:26:24,834",Curse this dress!
318,"00:26:32,175","00:26:33,718","Merida, stop this!"
319,"00:26:38,014","00:26:40,767",Don't you dare loose another arrow.
320,"00:26:50,109","00:26:52,278","Merida, I forbid it."
321,"00:27:23,059","00:27:25,270","Michty me!
I've just about had enough of you, lass!"
322,"00:27:25,770","00:27:28,481","- You're the one that wants me to...
- You embarrassed them."
323,"00:27:28,565","00:27:30,400","- You embarrassed me.
- I followed the rules."
324,"00:27:30,483","00:27:32,360",You don't know what you've done!
325,"00:27:32,443","00:27:34,988","- Just don't care how I...
- It'll be fire and sword if it's not set right."
326,"00:27:35,071","00:27:37,657","- Just listen!
- I am the Queen!"
327,"00:27:37,740","00:27:39,242",You listen to me!
328,"00:27:40,285","00:27:41,661",This is so unfair!
329,"00:27:42,161","00:27:43,496",Unfair?
330,"00:27:43,580","00:27:45,582",You're never there for me.
331,"00:27:45,665","00:27:48,334",This whole marriage is what you want.
332,"00:27:48,418","00:27:51,504","Do you ever bother to
ask what I want? No."
333,"00:27:51,588","00:27:54,507","You walk around telling me
what to do, what not to do,"
334,"00:27:54,799","00:27:57,093",trying to make me be like you.
335,"00:27:57,176","00:27:59,470","Well, I'm not going to be like you."
336,"00:27:59,554","00:28:01,222",You're acting like a child.
337,"00:28:01,306","00:28:04,142",And you're a beast.
338,"00:28:04,225","00:28:06,144","- That's what you are!
- Merida."
339,"00:28:06,227","00:28:08,521","- I'll never be like you.
- No, stop that!"
340,"00:28:08,605","00:28:10,857",I'd rather die than be like you!
341,"00:28:16,362","00:28:18,781","Merida, you are a princess,"
342,"00:28:18,990","00:28:21,784","and I expect you to act like one.
- Mum!"
343,"00:28:29,876","00:28:31,878",Merida!
344,"00:28:33,046","00:28:34,547",Merida!
345,"00:28:35,465","00:28:37,425","Oh, dear."
346,"00:28:41,179","00:28:43,765","Oh, no. What have I done?"
347,"00:29:21,344","00:29:22,762",Angus!
348,"00:30:08,558","00:30:11,561","Come on, Angus."
349,"00:30:11,644","00:30:12,895",Angus!
350,"00:31:01,736","00:31:04,197",Why would the wisps lead me here?
351,"00:31:29,347","00:31:31,224",Look around.
352,"00:31:31,307","00:31:33,476",You holler if you see anything you like.
353,"00:31:33,559","00:31:35,978",Everything is half off.
354,"00:31:41,901","00:31:44,487","- Who are you?
- Just a humble woodcarver."
355,"00:31:46,280","00:31:48,116",I don't understand...
356,"00:31:48,991","00:31:51,077",See anything you like?
357,"00:31:51,160","00:31:55,289","Perhaps a touch of whimsy to
brighten any dank chamber?"
358,"00:31:55,456","00:31:57,959","But the will-o'- the-wisps, they..."
359,"00:31:58,376","00:32:00,002",This is one of a kind!
360,"00:32:00,336","00:32:02,004",I'll make you a deal for this rare prize.
361,"00:32:04,340","00:32:05,758",Your broom!
362,"00:32:07,093","00:32:10,096","- It was sweeping by itself.
- That's ridiculous."
363,"00:32:10,179","00:32:12,849","Wood cannot be imbued
with magical properties."
364,"00:32:12,932","00:32:16,310",I should know. I'm a... Whittler.
365,"00:32:16,394","00:32:18,187",Of wood.
366,"00:32:18,980","00:32:23,776","How about this conversation starter?
It's made of yew wood."
367,"00:32:23,860","00:32:26,028",Tough as stone.
368,"00:32:27,572","00:32:29,615",That's stuffed.
369,"00:32:29,699","00:32:32,952","- Staring is rude.
- The crow's talking!"
370,"00:32:33,035","00:32:34,328",That's not all I can do.
371,"00:32:43,045","00:32:45,965","- You're a witch!
- Woodcarver."
372,"00:32:46,048","00:32:48,259",That's why the wisps led me here.
373,"00:32:48,843","00:32:50,928","- Woodcarver!
- You'll change my fate!"
374,"00:32:51,012","00:32:53,806","- Woodcarver!
- You see, it's my mother."
375,"00:32:53,890","00:32:56,976","I'm not a witch! Too many
unsatisfied customers."
376,"00:32:59,270","00:33:04,233","If you're not going to
buy anything, get out."
377,"00:33:04,734","00:33:07,570","- No! The wisps led me here!
- I don't care!"
378,"00:33:09,071","00:33:13,659","- Get out! Shoo! Get! Be gone with you!
- I'll buy it all."
379,"00:33:14,035","00:33:16,245","- What? What was that?
- Every carving."
380,"00:33:16,913","00:33:18,414",Well...
381,"00:33:19,415","00:33:22,752","And how are you going to
pay for that, sweetie?"
382,"00:33:22,835","00:33:23,920",With this.
383,"00:33:28,090","00:33:31,010","Oh, my, that's lovely, that is."
384,"00:33:31,093","00:33:32,511",That would set us up for months.
385,"00:33:36,224","00:33:41,270",Every carving and one spell.
386,"00:33:42,521","00:33:45,399","Are you sure you know
what you're doing?"
387,"00:33:45,566","00:33:49,278",I want a spell to change my mum.
388,"00:33:49,362","00:33:51,614",That'll change my fate.
389,"00:33:52,031","00:33:53,115",Done!
390,"00:33:54,909","00:33:56,410",Where are you going?
391,"00:33:57,536","00:33:58,955",There.
392,"00:33:59,038","00:34:00,122",What are you doing?
393,"00:34:00,831","00:34:03,042",You never conjure where you carve.
394,"00:34:03,125","00:34:04,794",Very important.
395,"00:34:09,131","00:34:11,509","The last time I did
this was for a prince."
396,"00:34:12,635","00:34:14,929",Easy on the eyes. Tight pants.
397,"00:34:15,638","00:34:18,599","He demanded I give him
the strength of ten men."
398,"00:34:18,683","00:34:21,936",And he gave me this for a spell.
399,"00:34:22,728","00:34:24,689",A spell that would change his fate.
400,"00:34:26,607","00:34:28,025",And did he get what he was after?
401,"00:34:29,026","00:34:33,656","Yes. And made off with an especially
attractive mahogany cheese board."
402,"00:34:33,990","00:34:36,325","Now, what do I need?"
403,"00:34:36,409","00:34:38,452",Just a little bit of this.
404,"00:34:47,295","00:34:48,754",That'll do.
405,"00:35:06,314","00:35:12,528",And now let's see. What have we here?
406,"00:35:18,534","00:35:19,618",Hey!
407,"00:35:21,203","00:35:22,455",A cake?
408,"00:35:22,538","00:35:25,541","- You don't want it?
- Yes! I want it."
409,"00:35:26,167","00:35:30,463","You're sure if I give this to my mum,"
410,"00:35:30,546","00:35:32,256",it will change my fate?
411,"00:35:34,175","00:35:37,470","Trust me. It'll do the trick, dearie."
412,"00:35:38,137","00:35:43,017","Expect delivery of your
purchase within a fortnight."
413,"00:35:45,936","00:35:48,147",What was that thing about the spell?
414,"00:35:48,898","00:35:51,817",Did you say something about
415,"00:35:52,777","00:35:54,904",the spell?
416,"00:35:57,907","00:36:02,912","Mor'du, Mor'du, now the time has
come for all of us to slaughter you"
417,"00:36:03,662","00:36:04,663",Hooray!
418,"00:36:04,747","00:36:06,540","Mor'du, Mor'du..."
419,"00:36:24,934","00:36:26,936","- Merida.
- Mum!"
420,"00:36:29,939","00:36:32,775","- I've been worried sick.
- You... You were?"
421,"00:36:32,858","00:36:35,403","I didn't know where you'd
gone or when you'd come back."
422,"00:36:35,486","00:36:38,406","I didn't know what to think.
Look at your dress."
423,"00:36:39,407","00:36:42,118",Angus threw me. But I'm not hurt.
424,"00:36:42,201","00:36:45,788","Well, you're home now,
so that's the end of it."
425,"00:36:46,789","00:36:50,126","- Honestly?
- I've pacified the lords for now."
426,"00:36:50,209","00:36:53,170","Your father's out there
""entertaining"" them."
427,"00:36:53,254","00:36:55,047","Come taste my blade, you manky bear"
428,"00:36:55,131","00:36:56,715",For gobbling up my leg
429,"00:36:57,216","00:37:00,886","I'll hunt you, then I'll skin
you, hang your noggin on a peg..."
430,"00:37:03,305","00:37:07,143","Of course, we both know a
decision still has to be made."
431,"00:37:11,105","00:37:13,899","- What's this?
- It's a peace offering."
432,"00:37:13,983","00:37:17,153",I made it. For you. Special.
433,"00:37:17,236","00:37:20,114",You made this for me?
434,"00:37:26,537","00:37:28,539",Interesting flavor.
435,"00:37:28,622","00:37:29,957",How do you feel?
436,"00:37:30,040","00:37:32,418","- What... What is that?
- Different?"
437,"00:37:33,669","00:37:36,881",Tart and gamy.
438,"00:37:37,214","00:37:40,968","Have you changed your mind at all
about the marriage and all that?"
439,"00:37:41,760","00:37:43,179",That's better.
440,"00:37:43,262","00:37:45,848","Now, why don't we go
upstairs to the lords"
441,"00:37:45,931","00:37:48,767",and put this whole kerfuffle to rest?
442,"00:37:57,985","00:38:00,779","- Mother?
- I'm woozy suddenly."
443,"00:38:00,863","00:38:03,324",My head's spinning like a top.
444,"00:38:03,491","00:38:07,161","- Mum!
- Suddenly I'm not so well."
445,"00:38:08,537","00:38:11,040","How do you feel about
the marriage now?"
446,"00:38:11,123","00:38:14,168",Merida! Just take me to my room.
447,"00:38:14,835","00:38:16,795","All right, that's fine.
That's just fine."
448,"00:38:16,879","00:38:20,716","A little to the left. That's good. A
wee bit to the left. That's good."
449,"00:38:20,799","00:38:22,426",It's good enough.
450,"00:38:22,510","00:38:25,429","Now, clear out of there, boys. I
don't want you to spoil my shot."
451,"00:38:25,513","00:38:27,181","- What?
- My lady Queen."
452,"00:38:27,765","00:38:30,184",We've been waiting patiently.
453,"00:38:30,392","00:38:35,231","Milords, I am out of
sorts at the moment."
454,"00:38:35,314","00:38:39,109",But you shall have your answer.
455,"00:38:41,278","00:38:42,780",Presently.
456,"00:38:42,863","00:38:45,741","Now, if you'll excuse us."
457,"00:38:47,660","00:38:48,953","Elinor, look!"
458,"00:38:49,203","00:38:51,205",It's Mor'du!
459,"00:38:52,748","00:38:54,667","Elinor? Are you all right, dear?"
460,"00:38:54,750","00:38:56,502",Fine. I'm fine.
461,"00:38:56,585","00:38:58,879",Go about avenging your leg.
462,"00:38:58,963","00:39:01,215","Aye. You heard her, lads."
463,"00:39:01,298","00:39:05,427","I dream about the perfect
way to make this devil die."
464,"00:39:09,390","00:39:12,601","Just take all the time you need
to getting yourself right, Mum."
465,"00:39:12,685","00:39:16,647","Then maybe in a bit you might have
something new to say on the marriage."
466,"00:39:16,897","00:39:19,149",What was in that cake?
467,"00:39:19,733","00:39:20,818",Cake.
468,"00:39:23,028","00:39:24,363",Mum?
469,"00:39:24,446","00:39:26,991","So I'll just tell them
the wedding's off, then?"
470,"00:39:32,037","00:39:34,039",Mum?
471,"00:40:01,025","00:40:02,151",Bear!
472,"00:40:36,810","00:40:37,978",Mum?
473,"00:40:39,813","00:40:42,983",You're... You're a bear!
474,"00:40:45,152","00:40:46,528",Why a bear?
475,"00:40:47,446","00:40:50,699","That scaffy witch gave
me a gammy spell."
476,"00:40:52,785","00:40:54,161",It's not my fault.
477,"00:40:54,244","00:40:56,163","I didn't ask her to
change you into a bear."
478,"00:40:56,246","00:41:01,043",I just wanted her to change you.
479,"00:41:07,091","00:41:09,385",Did you hear that?
480,"00:41:09,468","00:41:11,720",Something's not right.
481,"00:41:14,973","00:41:18,394","There's no point in having a go at me.
The witch is to blame."
482,"00:41:18,477","00:41:20,604",Goggly old hag.
483,"00:41:21,522","00:41:23,982",Eyes all over the place.
484,"00:41:24,900","00:41:26,735",Unbelievable.
485,"00:41:28,904","00:41:30,823",I'll get her to fix this.
486,"00:41:30,906","00:41:33,534","Why do I always get blamed for everything?
It's just not fair."
487,"00:41:36,995","00:41:39,623","Everybody, follow me."
488,"00:41:39,707","00:41:41,709",And keep a sharp eye.
489,"00:41:42,960","00:41:45,504","Here we go. Another hunt
through the castle."
490,"00:41:45,587","00:41:47,423",But we haven't had dessert yet.
491,"00:41:53,429","00:41:54,763",I have no idea.
492,"00:41:55,639","00:41:58,475","Mum, you can't go out there."
493,"00:41:59,435","00:42:01,812",Mum! Wait!
494,"00:42:03,439","00:42:07,317","What are you doing? Dad.
The Bear King?"
495,"00:42:07,401","00:42:09,570","If he so much as sees you, you're dead."
496,"00:42:09,820","00:42:13,532","Another one of your entertainments
to bore us to death!"
497,"00:42:13,615","00:42:15,033",And what exactly are we after...
498,"00:42:15,117","00:42:16,160",Mum!
499,"00:42:16,618","00:42:18,036",...my liege?
500,"00:42:18,120","00:42:21,290","Best to humor him. He is,
after all, the King."
501,"00:42:25,210","00:42:27,588",He's like a hound with that nose of his.
502,"00:42:29,047","00:42:30,883","Mum, wait."
503,"00:42:30,966","00:42:32,384",We have to...
504,"00:42:33,802","00:42:34,803",Follow me.
505,"00:42:34,887","00:42:36,680",Stop.
506,"00:42:36,764","00:42:37,806",Stop!
507,"00:42:41,185","00:42:43,353",You're covered with fur.
508,"00:42:43,437","00:42:45,105",You're not naked.
509,"00:42:45,189","00:42:47,065",It's not like anyone's gonna see you.
510,"00:42:54,948","00:42:56,074",Now you've done it.
511,"00:42:58,535","00:43:00,245",Maudie!
512,"00:43:00,746","00:43:03,040","Just calm down, lass. What is it?"
513,"00:43:04,166","00:43:05,292","Spit it out, Maudie!"
514,"00:43:05,667","00:43:07,169",A bear!
515,"00:43:07,252","00:43:08,879",I knew it!
516,"00:43:10,172","00:43:11,965",Would you just listen to me?
517,"00:43:12,049","00:43:14,885",We can't go this way. You'll be seen.
518,"00:43:14,968","00:43:16,261",Quick! This way!
519,"00:43:18,680","00:43:19,681",Mum?
520,"00:43:35,906","00:43:37,616",Mum?
521,"00:43:56,426","00:43:59,596","A witch turned Mum into a bear.
It's not my fault."
522,"00:43:59,680","00:44:02,057","We've got to get out of the castle.
I need your help."
523,"00:44:03,433","00:44:04,476",All right.
524,"00:44:04,560","00:44:07,813","You can have my desserts for two...
Three weeks."
525,"00:44:09,398","00:44:11,567",Okay. Fine. A year.
526,"00:44:17,573","00:44:19,324",Did you hear that?
527,"00:44:27,124","00:44:28,333",There it goes!
528,"00:44:31,503","00:44:32,504","Come on, lads!"
529,"00:44:40,429","00:44:41,513",There it goes!
530,"00:44:55,110","00:44:57,446","Come on, Mum."
531,"00:45:01,116","00:45:02,367",Think we should lay a trap?
532,"00:45:02,451","00:45:04,161",Try shutting yours!
533,"00:45:07,706","00:45:09,541",There he is!
534,"00:45:21,970","00:45:23,639",I'm sure it went this way.
535,"00:45:23,722","00:45:25,265",You can see my house from here.
536,"00:45:25,349","00:45:27,267",It must have sprouted wings.
537,"00:45:27,351","00:45:30,520",Was carried away by a giant birdy.
538,"00:45:30,604","00:45:33,815","- A dragon, perhaps.
- Bear in the castle!"
539,"00:45:33,899","00:45:35,859","Doesn't make sense.
It cannot open doors."
540,"00:45:35,943","00:45:37,819",He's got big giant paws!
541,"00:45:37,945","00:45:39,363",Let's just get inside.
542,"00:45:41,615","00:45:44,242","- It's locked.
- Dingwall was the last up."
543,"00:45:44,326","00:45:46,495",I propped it open with a stick.
544,"00:45:52,709","00:45:56,338","What did you see, Maudie?
Just spit it out, Maudie."
545,"00:45:57,005","00:45:59,549","For goodness' sakes, Maudie,
would you get a grip?"
546,"00:46:04,471","00:46:06,181","Maudie, honey, come here!
It's all right!"
547,"00:46:08,058","00:46:09,184","Come on, Mum. Quick."
548,"00:46:30,414","00:46:32,207","They'll be fine. Won't you, boys?"
549,"00:46:33,792","00:46:36,128","Mum, we've got to hurry."
550,"00:46:36,211","00:46:37,838","Now, I'll be back soon."
551,"00:46:37,921","00:46:41,008","Go on and help yourself to
anything you want, as a reward."
552,"00:46:58,817","00:47:00,527",Right!
553,"00:47:07,659","00:47:09,703",Where are these wisps?
554,"00:47:09,786","00:47:13,123","Come out, wisps. Come on out."
555,"00:47:14,750","00:47:17,335",Lead me to the witch's cottage.
556,"00:47:18,462","00:47:20,464",I'm here!
557,"00:47:21,381","00:47:24,968","Fine. Don't come out now
that my mum's watching."
558,"00:47:26,511","00:47:30,974","I was standing right here and
the wisp appeared right there."
559,"00:47:31,058","00:47:34,978","Then a whole trail of them
led me off into the forest."
560,"00:47:41,485","00:47:45,155","Does she think we're just going to
happen upon the witch's cottage?"
561,"00:47:59,252","00:48:01,463","Mum, I know this place."
562,"00:48:01,838","00:48:03,799",The witch's cottage...
563,"00:48:04,633","00:48:07,803",It's this way! Come on! Hurry!
564,"00:48:17,187","00:48:20,148",I can't believe it. I found it.
565,"00:48:24,861","00:48:27,614",No. She was here.
566,"00:48:28,532","00:48:31,576","No, really, she was just here."
567,"00:48:33,453","00:48:34,579",Wait.
568,"00:48:39,292","00:48:41,336",No.
569,"00:48:41,419","00:48:44,840","No, no. No! No!"
570,"00:49:10,198","00:49:12,617","Welcome to the Crafty Carver,"

596,"00:50:25,440","00:50:27,943","- Welcome to the Crafty Carver...
- What?"
597,"00:50:28,026","00:50:30,237",...for all your...
598,"00:50:30,320","00:50:34,491","Maybe there's a book of spells. Look around.
We'll need more vials."

Have a lovely day."
601,"00:51:22,539","00:51:24,791",We'll sort it out tomorrow.

603,"00:52:16,551","00:52:19,554",I'll always be right here.
604,"00:52:42,994","00:52:44,829",Good morning.
605,"00:52:46,081","00:52:48,124",So...
606,"00:52:48,208","00:52:50,043",What's all this supposed to be?
607,"00:52:55,757","00:52:57,300",What?
608,"00:53:04,182","00:53:06,101",Sorry. I don't speak bear.
609,"00:53:27,122","00:53:28,998","Find those by the creek, did you?"
610,"00:53:29,791","00:53:31,292",They're nightshade berries.
611,"00:53:34,295","00:53:35,422",They're poisonous.
612,"00:53:43,972","00:53:47,142","Where did you get this water?
It has worms."
613,"00:53:58,820","00:54:00,780",Come on.
614,"00:54:08,997","00:54:10,123",Breakfast.
615,"00:54:12,083","00:54:16,754","Wait. A princess should not
have weapons, in your opinion."
616,"00:54:18,673","00:54:20,258",There you go.
617,"00:54:21,676","00:54:23,094",Go on.
618,"00:54:25,930","00:54:28,475","How do you know you don't
like it if you won't try it?"
619,"00:56:36,477","00:56:37,604",Hey!
620,"00:56:39,397","00:56:41,774",Where are you going?
621,"00:56:52,660","00:56:53,953","Mum, come back."
622,"00:57:07,967","00:57:10,094","Mum, is that you?"
623,"00:57:15,183","00:57:17,185",Mum?
624,"00:57:22,690","00:57:24,692",You changed.
625,"00:57:24,776","00:57:26,319",Like you were a...
626,"00:57:27,945","00:57:30,573","I mean, like you were
a bear on the inside."
627,"00:57:40,458","00:57:41,959",A wisp.
628,"00:57:42,210","00:57:43,711",Mum!
629,"00:57:44,545","00:57:45,755",Stop it!
630,"00:57:48,257","00:57:49,258","Mum, no!"
631,"00:57:51,469","00:57:52,553",Mum...
632,"00:57:59,060","00:58:01,354","Jings, crivens, help ma boab."
633,"00:58:01,437","00:58:03,773","Mum, I know you're scared,"
634,"00:58:03,856","00:58:06,818","you're tired, you don't understand,"
635,"00:58:06,901","00:58:10,238",but we've got to keep our heads.
636,"00:58:10,321","00:58:12,657",Just calm down.
637,"00:58:13,116","00:58:15,118",Listen.
638,"00:58:43,646","00:58:45,148",They'll show us the way.
639,"00:59:13,509","00:59:15,261","Mum, look."
640,"00:59:25,313","00:59:27,815",Why did the wisps bring us here?
641,"00:59:54,926","00:59:57,345","Whoever they were, they've been
gone for a long, long time."
642,"01:00:04,435","01:00:07,313","I'm fine, Mum. Just fine."
643,"01:00:16,989","01:00:18,991",It's
644,"01:00:19,867","01:00:20,952",a throne room.
645,"01:00:22,620","01:00:24,455","You suppose this could've
been the kingdom"
646,"01:00:24,539","01:00:26,249",in that story you were telling me?
647,"01:00:27,542","01:00:29,043",The one with the princes.
648,"01:00:32,964","01:00:34,674","One,"
649,"01:00:34,757","01:00:35,842","two,"
650,"01:00:36,342","01:00:37,552","three,"
651,"01:00:37,844","01:00:39,387",four.
652,"01:00:39,846","01:00:41,347",The oldest.
653,"01:00:44,267","01:00:46,435","Split, like the tapestry."
654,"01:00:52,066","01:00:55,403",The spell. It's happened before.
655,"01:01:00,032","01:01:02,535","""Strength of ten men. """
656,"01:01:03,870","01:01:06,038","""Fate be changed. """
657,"01:01:08,416","01:01:11,085","""Changed his fate. """
658,"01:01:12,211","01:01:13,838","Oh, no."
659,"01:01:13,921","01:01:15,965",The prince became...
660,"01:01:21,804","01:01:22,847",Mor'du.
661,"01:02:29,288","01:02:31,958","Mum, we need to get back to the castle."
662,"01:02:32,625","01:02:35,878","If we don't hurry, you'll
become like Mor'du."
663,"01:02:35,962","01:02:37,380",A bear!
664,"01:02:37,463","01:02:39,757",A real bear. Forever!
665,"01:02:41,342","01:02:44,178","""Mend the bond torn by pride. """
666,"01:02:44,261","01:02:47,890","The witch gave us the answer.
The tapestry."
667,"01:02:57,525","01:03:00,403","Mum, do you have a better idea?"
668,"01:03:19,005","01:03:20,047",That'll do.
669,"01:03:34,520","01:03:35,521",No more talk.
670,"01:03:35,604","01:03:38,899",No more traditions. We settle this now!
671,"01:03:38,983","01:03:40,484",You're the King.
672,"01:03:40,568","01:03:44,447","You decide which one of our
sons your daughter will marry."
673,"01:03:44,530","01:03:47,658","None of your sons are fit
to marry my daughter."
674,"01:03:47,742","01:03:50,911","Then our alliance is over!
This means war!"
675,"01:03:55,541","01:03:57,209",They're gonna murder each other.
676,"01:03:57,293","01:03:58,961","You've got to stop them
before it's too late."
677,"01:04:01,547","01:04:03,007","I know, I know!"
678,"01:04:03,090","01:04:05,718","But how do we get you through
there and up to the tapestry"
679,"01:04:05,801","01:04:07,845","with the lot of them
boiling over like that?"
680,"01:04:27,281","01:04:30,576","- What are you doing, lass?
- It's all right, Dad."
681,"01:04:31,285","01:04:32,912",I...
682,"01:04:34,163","01:04:35,998",I have...
683,"01:04:37,166","01:04:39,919","Well, you see, I..."
684,"01:04:40,127","01:04:42,630","I have been in conference
with the Queen."
685,"01:04:42,922","01:04:45,549","- Is that so?
- Aye, it is."
686,"01:04:45,633","01:04:47,885","- Well, where is she, then?
- She..."
687,"01:04:47,968","01:04:50,054","How do we know that
this isn't some trick?"
688,"01:04:50,137","01:04:51,972","- I'd never...
- This is highly irregular."
689,"01:04:52,056","01:04:53,933","- What are you playing at?
- Where is the Queen?"
690,"01:04:54,016","01:04:56,560","We will not stand for any
more of this jiggery-pokery."
691,"01:04:56,644","01:04:58,813","- That's right. Let's see her.
- Shut it!"
692,"01:05:03,651","01:05:05,820","Well, I..."
693,"01:05:15,454","01:05:19,125",Once there was an ancient kingdom.
694,"01:05:19,208","01:05:20,209",What is this?
695,"01:05:21,168","01:05:24,588",That kingdom fell into war
696,"01:05:24,672","01:05:27,258",and chaos and ruin...
697,"01:05:27,341","01:05:29,927","We've all heard that tale.
Lost kingdom."
698,"01:05:30,010","01:05:31,512","Aye, but it's true."
699,"01:05:31,595","01:05:35,266","I know now how one selfish act
can turn the fate of a kingdom."
700,"01:05:35,349","01:05:36,767",It's just a legend.
701,"01:05:36,851","01:05:38,519",Legends are lessons.
702,"01:05:39,353","01:05:41,355",They ring with truths.
703,"01:05:42,439","01:05:44,275",Our kingdom is young.
704,"01:05:44,358","01:05:46,360",Our stories are not yet legend.
705,"01:05:47,069","01:05:49,655","But in them, our bond was struck."
706,"01:05:49,738","01:05:51,866",Our clans were once enemies.
707,"01:05:52,366","01:05:55,286","But when invaders
threatened us from the sea,"
708,"01:05:55,536","01:05:58,372",you joined together to defend our lands.
709,"01:05:59,081","01:06:01,584",You fought for each other.
710,"01:06:01,667","01:06:03,669",You risked everything for each other.
711,"01:06:04,545","01:06:07,256","Lord MacGuffin, my dad saved your life,"
712,"01:06:07,381","01:06:09,592","stopping an arrow as you
ran to Dingwall's aid."
713,"01:06:09,675","01:06:11,510","Aye, and I'll never forget it."
714,"01:06:12,011","01:06:13,220","And, Lord Macintosh,"
715,"01:06:13,554","01:06:16,640","you saved my dad when you
charged in on heavy horse"
716,"01:06:16,724","01:06:18,434",and held off the advance.
717,"01:06:18,517","01:06:22,563","And we all know how Lord
Dingwall broke the enemy line."
718,"01:06:22,646","01:06:24,690",With a mighty throw of his spear!
719,"01:06:24,773","01:06:26,734","I was aiming at you, you big tumshie."
720,"01:06:28,694","01:06:31,822","The story of this kingdom
is a powerful one."
721,"01:06:31,906","01:06:34,366",My dad rallied your forces
722,"01:06:34,575","01:06:36,952",and you made him your king.
723,"01:06:37,036","01:06:41,123","It was an alliance forged
in bravery and friendship"
724,"01:06:41,207","01:06:42,917",and it lives to this day.
725,"01:06:48,464","01:06:51,008",But I've been selfish.
726,"01:06:51,091","01:06:54,136",I tore a great rift in our kingdom.
727,"01:06:54,970","01:06:57,056",There's no one to blame but me.
728,"01:06:57,890","01:07:01,560","And I know now that I
need to amend my mistake"
729,"01:07:02,728","01:07:04,396",and mend our bond.
730,"01:07:05,981","01:07:09,818","And so, there is the
matter of my betrothal."
731,"01:07:11,237","01:07:14,531",I've decided to do what's right
732,"01:07:14,615","01:07:15,783",and...
733,"01:07:16,158","01:07:17,201",...and...
734,"01:07:18,953","01:07:20,621",...and...
735,"01:07:21,622","01:07:24,792",...break tradition.
736,"01:07:31,173","01:07:33,008","My mother,"
737,"01:07:34,301","01:07:36,971","the Queen, feels..."
738,"01:07:39,014","01:07:40,808",in her heart
739,"01:07:40,891","01:07:42,810",that I...
740,"01:07:44,520","01:07:47,189",...that we be free to...
741,"01:07:48,565","01:07:52,152",...write our own story...
742,"01:07:53,904","01:07:58,158",...follow our hearts
743,"01:07:59,118","01:08:02,746",and find love in our own time.
744,"01:08:06,500","01:08:09,753",That's beautiful.
745,"01:08:09,837","01:08:13,549","The Queen and I put the
decision to you, my lords."
746,"01:08:13,924","01:08:17,803","Might our young people decide for
themselves who they will love?"
747,"01:08:18,679","01:08:22,141","Well, since you've obviously
made up your minds about this,"
748,"01:08:22,224","01:08:24,393",I have one thing to say.
749,"01:08:24,476","01:08:26,770","- This is...
- A grand idea!"
750,"01:08:26,854","01:08:29,273","Give us our own say
in choosing our fate."
751,"01:08:29,356","01:08:32,443","- What?
- Aye. Why shouldn't we choose?"
752,"01:08:32,526","01:08:34,695",But she's the princess.
753,"01:08:34,778","01:08:37,781",I did not pick her out. It was your idea.
754,"01:08:37,865","01:08:41,076",And you... You feel the same way?
755,"01:08:46,332","01:08:47,374",Good?
756,"01:08:51,337","01:08:52,963","Well, that settles it."
757,"01:08:53,047","01:08:57,676","Let these lads try and win her
heart before they win her hand."
758,"01:08:57,760","01:08:59,178",If they can.
759,"01:08:59,261","01:09:02,139","I say, the wee Dingwall
has a fighting chance."
760,"01:09:02,222","01:09:04,516","Fine, then. Seems for once we agree."
761,"01:09:04,600","01:09:06,477",It was my idea in the first place.
762,"01:09:17,738","01:09:19,615",Just like your mum.
763,"01:09:19,698","01:09:21,075",You devil.
764,"01:09:27,414","01:09:29,625",Everyone to the cellar!
765,"01:09:29,708","01:09:34,129","Let's crack open the King's
private reserve to celebrate!"
766,"01:09:37,466","01:09:38,801","Whoa, whoa, whoa."
767,"01:09:40,094","01:09:42,096",Bring the tiny glasses.
768,"01:09:56,110","01:09:57,444","Oh, the tapestry!"
769,"01:10:00,239","01:10:02,741",Mend the bond...
770,"01:10:03,951","01:10:06,036",Mend the bond.
771,"01:10:06,120","01:10:08,872",Stitch it up. This'll change you back.
772,"01:10:08,956","01:10:11,291",We just need needle and thread.
773,"01:10:17,631","01:10:18,715",Mum?
774,"01:10:21,468","01:10:23,345",Mum? Not now.
775,"01:10:23,595","01:10:25,931","No. Please, not now."
776,"01:10:27,391","01:10:28,851",Mum...
777,"01:10:37,484","01:10:43,574","Elinor, clear, you'll never guess who
just solved our little suitor problem."
778,"01:10:55,252","01:10:56,587",Elinor!
779,"01:10:59,339","01:11:03,135","It can't be true! Elinor,
answer me, lass!"
780,"01:11:03,218","01:11:05,345",Elinor!
781,"01:11:06,430","01:11:07,431",Merida.
782,"01:11:08,849","01:11:11,143","- What?
- Dad, no! It's not what you think."
783,"01:11:11,226","01:11:13,353","- Merida, get back!
- No!"
784,"01:11:18,358","01:11:20,444","No, Dad! Don't hurt her!"
785,"01:11:21,361","01:11:23,197",Get out of here!
786,"01:11:23,363","01:11:26,033",Merida! No!
787,"01:11:30,078","01:11:31,997",No!
788,"01:11:40,297","01:11:41,798",Mum.
789,"01:11:45,844","01:11:50,724","It's all right. I'm all right. It's nothing.
It's just a little scratch. Mum!"
790,"01:11:51,099","01:11:52,768",My liege!
791,"01:11:52,851","01:11:54,394",Fergus.
792,"01:11:55,479","01:11:57,147",Bear!
793,"01:11:58,190","01:11:59,274",Dad!
794,"01:11:59,358","01:12:01,902","Count your stars, lass. It almost had you.
Are you hurt?"
795,"01:12:01,985","01:12:03,737","It's your wife, Elinor."
796,"01:12:07,658","01:12:08,992",Close the gate!
797,"01:12:12,412","01:12:14,498","- You're talking nonsense!
- It's the truth!"
798,"01:12:14,581","01:12:17,793","There was a witch and she gave me a spell.
It's not Mor'du."
799,"01:12:17,876","01:12:20,295","Mor'du or not, I'll avenge your mother!"
800,"01:12:20,587","01:12:24,424","- I'll not risk losing you, too.
- No, Dad! Just listen to me."
801,"01:12:24,508","01:12:27,094",Listen! You can't!
802,"01:12:27,177","01:12:31,515","- It's your wife Elinor!
- Maudie, keep this and don't let her out."
803,"01:12:31,598","01:12:34,434","- What about the bear?
- Just stay put."
804,"01:13:01,295","01:13:03,964","Come on, you sorry bunch of galoots!"
805,"01:13:12,848","01:13:14,224",Mum!
806,"01:13:14,308","01:13:15,892",No.
807,"01:13:15,976","01:13:18,270",No. Mum.
808,"01:13:39,666","01:13:41,126",Maudie. Maudie!
809,"01:13:41,710","01:13:43,795",I need you!
810,"01:13:43,879","01:13:45,380",Now!
811,"01:13:49,593","01:13:51,345","Oh, no."
812,"01:13:53,138","01:13:54,890",Maudie.
813,"01:13:59,936","01:14:01,021",Get the key.
814,"01:14:21,208","01:14:22,584",Maudie!
815,"01:14:28,840","01:14:31,343","Needle and thread. Needle and thread.
Needle and thread."
816,"01:14:50,112","01:14:51,196",There he goes!
817,"01:14:51,279","01:14:53,907","Needle and thread. Needle and thread.
Needle and thread."
818,"01:14:53,990","01:14:55,242",You beauty!
819,"01:15:22,144","01:15:25,355","One, two..."
820,"01:15:54,342","01:15:56,762","Steady, Hamish."
821,"01:15:57,137","01:15:59,139",There he goes.
822,"01:16:09,357","01:16:10,984",We've got his track!
823,"01:16:15,697","01:16:17,866","- Back, back, back!
- Get him!"
824,"01:16:21,870","01:16:23,997","Angus! Easy, laddie."
825,"01:16:27,542","01:16:29,377","Hubert, Harris, help Hamish."
826,"01:16:30,420","01:16:33,006","Watch your blade! You're going
to take somebody's arm off!"
827,"01:16:33,840","01:16:35,300","Aye, we've got you now!"
828,"01:16:36,843","01:16:39,429","- Give me a hand over here!
- Put your back into it, Dingwall!"
829,"01:16:39,513","01:16:40,806",I'm doing all the pulling here.
830,"01:16:40,889","01:16:42,140","Down you go, you scoundrel."
831,"01:16:45,644","01:16:47,020",Done!
832,"01:17:11,962","01:17:15,966","- Get back. That's my mother.
- Are you out of your mind, lass?"
833,"01:17:16,049","01:17:17,509","Mum, are you hurt?"
834,"01:17:24,891","01:17:25,892",Merida!
835,"01:17:28,728","01:17:31,273",I'll not let you kill my mother.
836,"01:17:33,567","01:17:35,235",Boys!
837,"01:17:35,735","01:17:36,820",Boys?
838,"01:17:43,451","01:17:45,120","- Mor'du!
- Kill it!"
839,"01:17:49,958","01:17:50,959",You Scoundrel!
840,"01:17:55,380","01:17:58,383","Come on! I'll take you
with my bare hands!"
841,"01:18:32,459","01:18:33,460",Mum!
842,"01:19:50,328","01:19:52,205",The second sunrise.
843,"01:20:31,578","01:20:33,413",No...
844,"01:20:34,956","01:20:37,083",I don't understand. I...
845,"01:20:48,553","01:20:52,140","Oh, Mum, I'm sorry."
846,"01:20:54,100","01:20:56,352",This is all my fault.
847,"01:20:56,436","01:20:58,772",I did this to you.
848,"01:20:58,855","01:21:00,398",To us.
849,"01:21:06,696","01:21:08,782",You've always been there for me.
850,"01:21:10,116","01:21:12,160",You've never given up on me.
851,"01:21:14,204","01:21:15,914",I just want you back.
852,"01:21:21,461","01:21:23,463","I want you back, Mummy."
853,"01:21:43,233","01:21:45,235",I love you.
854,"01:22:13,388","01:22:15,140",Mum! You're back!
855,"01:22:21,896","01:22:23,273",You changed!
856,"01:22:23,982","01:22:25,525","Oh, darling,"
857,"01:22:26,192","01:22:28,027",we both have.
858,"01:22:29,362","01:22:30,572",Elinor!
859,"01:22:35,451","01:22:37,328",Elinor!
860,"01:22:44,127","01:22:45,253","Oh, dear."
861,"01:22:47,255","01:22:48,673",You're back. She came back to us.
862,"01:22:48,756","01:22:50,633","It's a great day for this kingdom.
The curse is broke."
863,"01:22:52,552","01:22:54,429",Mum.
864,"01:22:55,722","01:22:56,973",Dear?
865,"01:22:57,056","01:22:58,141",I'm naked.
866,"01:22:58,224","01:23:00,393",Naked as a wee babby.
867,"01:23:00,476","01:23:02,604",Don't just stare at me. Do something!
868,"01:23:04,063","01:23:06,482","What the... Avert your eyes, lads!"
869,"01:23:06,566","01:23:07,942",Show some respect!
870,"01:23:12,739","01:23:15,742","Now that's what I call
a wee naked babby!"
871,"01:23:19,454","01:23:22,165","Merida, Elinor, hurry up.
They're leaving."
872,"01:23:22,248","01:23:24,417","- Mum!
- They're off! Come on!"
873,"01:23:24,500","01:23:26,920","We've got to wave them off!
Come along!"
874,"01:23:55,615","01:24:00,745","Goodbye! All the best!
Fair wind to your sails!"
875,"01:24:05,833","01:24:07,627",But how did this...
876,"01:24:13,967","01:24:17,512","There are those who say fate is
something beyond our command,"
877,"01:24:18,471","01:24:21,015",that destiny is not our own.
878,"01:24:21,349","01:24:23,351",But I know better.
879,"01:24:25,061","01:24:27,563",Our fate lives within us.
880,"01:24:29,399","01:24:32,151","You only have to be
brave enough to see it."
881,"01:33:00,201","01:33:02,536","Delivery. Sign here, sign here."
882,"01:33:05,372","01:33:07,625","Come on, birdbrain. I
haven't got all day."
