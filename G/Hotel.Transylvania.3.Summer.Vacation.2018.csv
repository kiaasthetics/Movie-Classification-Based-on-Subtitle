she's not coming."
71,"00:05:11,312","00:05:13,079","Oh, don't worry."
72,"00:05:13,081","00:05:17,751","Mavis is with her. I'm sure
everything is under control."
73,"00:05:17,753","00:05:20,287","Mavey, is everything
under control?"
74,"00:05:20,289","00:05:23,055","Um, yep, just a slight case
of pre-wedding jitters."
75,"00:05:26,761","00:05:27,762",Ahhh!
76,"00:05:34,001","00:05:35,735","Yep, everything is
fine here."
77,"00:05:37,105","00:05:38,939","Please try to relax, Lucy."
78,"00:05:38,941","00:05:40,840","I've taken care
of everything."
79,"00:05:40,842","00:05:43,776","The wedding
is going to be perfect."
80,"00:05:43,778","00:05:45,177",It's not that.
81,"00:05:45,179","00:05:48,280","Just, how do I know
I'm doing the right thing?"
82,"00:05:50,919","00:05:53,119",I know just how you feel.
83,"00:05:53,121","00:05:56,322","The day I married Johnny was
the best day of my life,"
84,"00:05:56,324","00:05:58,124",but I was so nervous.
85,"00:05:58,126","00:06:00,026","Not as nervous
as I was."
86,"00:06:00,028","00:06:02,829","And you should have seen my dad.
He was a mess."
87,"00:06:02,831","00:06:05,665","I wouldn't get out
of my coffin that night."
88,"00:06:05,667","00:06:07,667","But he knew
it was meant to be."
89,"00:06:07,669","00:06:09,802","It doesn't matter
where you come from"
90,"00:06:09,804","00:06:11,370","or how different
you are."
91,"00:06:11,372","00:06:14,006","A Zing only happens
once in your life,"
92,"00:06:14,008","00:06:15,641","and you have to
cherish it."
93,"00:06:17,278","00:06:19,980",Aw.
94,"00:06:19,982","00:06:22,047",You're right! Thank you!
95,"00:06:22,049","00:06:24,184","Okay.

96,"00:06:24,186","00:06:26,088",Oh. Uh... Okay.
97,"00:06:29,357","00:06:30,790",I do.
98,"00:06:32,960","00:06:33,960",I do.
99,"00:06:39,934","00:06:41,401",Do you hear that?
100,"00:06:41,403","00:06:42,869","Yes. I thought we
locked him in his room."
101,"00:06:42,871","00:06:44,037",We did!
102,"00:06:44,039","00:06:46,206",Whoa! Whoa!
103,"00:06:46,208","00:06:47,807","Hi, Mom. Hi, Papa."
104,"00:06:47,809","00:06:49,108","- Dennis!
- Dennis!"
105,"00:06:49,110","00:06:51,011","Tinkles was crying,
so we let him out."
106,"00:06:55,816","00:06:56,886",Ahhh!
107,"00:07:00,287","00:07:02,157","Tinkles, sit!"
108,"00:07:09,398","00:07:12,232","Ah. Whose idea was it
to let Dennis have a puppy?"
109,"00:07:12,234","00:07:15,134",Um... Yours?
110,"00:07:16,371","00:07:17,673",Right.
111,"00:07:18,306","00:07:20,072",Poor Tinkles.
112,"00:07:20,074","00:07:22,141",Dennis...
113,"00:07:22,143","00:07:24,778","Look, honey,
I know you love Tinkles,"
114,"00:07:24,780","00:07:26,745","but we're not allowed
to bring our dogs..."
115,"00:07:26,747","00:07:29,848","Uh... I mean, our pets everywhere."
116,"00:07:29,850","00:07:30,850",Okay?
117,"00:07:30,852","00:07:32,218",Okay.
118,"00:07:36,758","00:07:39,059",DJ Jazzy Johnny in the house.
119,"00:07:39,061","00:07:43,129","It's time to welcome the happy
couple, Mr. and Mrs. Prickles!"
120,"00:07:43,131","00:07:46,102",Aw!
121,"00:07:48,003","00:07:49,968","The bride and groom
invite everyone"
122,"00:07:49,970","00:07:52,204","to join them
on the dance floor."
123,"00:07:55,876","00:07:57,143",Care to dance?
124,"00:08:02,117","00:08:03,348",Is that her?
125,"00:08:03,350","00:08:04,951",Ooh! Watch out now.
126,"00:08:04,953","00:08:07,487","She got stitches
in all the right places."
127,"00:08:07,489","00:08:10,824","Okay, there's no way that
is related to you, Frank."
128,"00:08:10,826","00:08:12,492","No, she's
my right arm's cousin."
129,"00:08:13,929","00:08:15,829",Ay! Oh!
130,"00:08:15,831","00:08:18,331","- Oh!
- Ah! I see it now."
131,"00:08:18,333","00:08:20,400",Frank wanted me to meet you.
132,"00:08:20,402","00:08:23,939","We're arm cousins,
twice removed."
133,"00:08:25,407","00:08:26,872",Of course.
134,"00:08:26,874","00:08:30,477","I'd recognize that bicep
anywhere."
135,"00:08:30,479","00:08:33,178","He thought, since we're both
single, we might hit it off,"
136,"00:08:33,180","00:08:34,480",maybe go on a date?
137,"00:08:34,482","00:08:36,115","""Date""? Oh!"
138,"00:08:36,117","00:08:38,453","Well, eh,
it's just that, eh..."
139,"00:08:40,856","00:08:43,022",Whoa!
140,"00:08:43,024","00:08:46,058","The DJ booth
is a sacred space!"
141,"00:08:46,060","00:08:48,094",I love this song!
142,"00:08:50,397","00:08:51,531",Don't you?
143,"00:08:51,533","00:08:52,932",Dracula?
144,"00:08:52,934","00:08:54,868","Oh, where'd he go?"
145,"00:08:54,870","00:08:56,802",Dracula?
146,"00:09:00,107","00:09:02,008","What's the matter, Drac,
you didn't like her?"
147,"00:09:02,010","00:09:04,244","No offense, but you
can't be too picky."
148,"00:09:04,246","00:09:06,278","You haven't had a date
in 100 years."
149,"00:09:06,280","00:09:10,850","Look, guys, I appreciate your
concern, but it's not up to me."
150,"00:09:10,852","00:09:14,119","You only Zing once,
and I did."
151,"00:09:14,121","00:09:16,054","Times have changed, buddy."
152,"00:09:16,056","00:09:18,490","You can even find someone to
Zing with on your phone now."
153,"00:09:18,492","00:09:20,293",What? Really?
154,"00:09:20,295","00:09:21,927","Oh. Oh, no, no, no."
155,"00:09:21,929","00:09:23,897",I'm far too busy.
156,"00:09:23,899","00:09:27,801","I have Mavis and Dennis and the
hotel, and bleh, bleh-bleh."
157,"00:09:27,803","00:09:30,068","Um, did you guys
hear that?"
158,"00:09:30,070","00:09:32,071","He actually said,
""Bleh, bleh-bleh."""
159,"00:09:32,073","00:09:34,143","I don't say,
""Bleh, bleh-bleh""!"
160,"00:09:42,016","00:09:45,384","Eh, uh,
I'm looking for a Zing."
161,"00:09:45,386","00:09:48,288",Okay. Changing phone ring.
162,"00:09:48,290","00:09:52,124","No, no.
I'm looking for a date."
163,"00:09:54,895","00:09:55,894","No, no, no."
164,"00:09:55,896","00:09:57,964",I want to meet someone.
165,"00:10:00,535","00:10:02,869",Are you kidding me right now?
166,"00:10:02,871","00:10:06,004","Don't you get it?
I want to go on a date!"
167,"00:10:06,006","00:10:08,541",I'm lonely.
168,"00:10:10,612","00:10:13,145",You want baloney.
169,"00:10:18,953","00:10:20,887","What? Look at
that hair. Come on."
170,"00:10:20,889","00:10:22,488",Ah. Too many eyes.
171,"00:10:22,490","00:10:24,224",Too few eyes.
172,"00:10:24,226","00:10:25,959",Not into tentacles.
173,"00:10:25,961","00:10:27,192","""Match found""?"
174,"00:10:27,194","00:10:29,028","No, no, no!"
175,"00:10:29,030","00:10:30,363",First things first.
176,"00:10:30,365","00:10:31,431",Whoa!
177,"00:10:31,433","00:10:33,365",I'm not into games.
178,"00:10:33,367","00:10:35,487","You'd better have a job,
and my cats have to like you."
179,"00:10:37,539","00:10:39,071","Oh, no."
180,"00:10:39,073","00:10:40,940","Oh, whoa, no."
181,"00:10:40,942","00:10:41,941",Dad?
182,"00:10:41,943","00:10:43,275",Oh! Mavis! Oh.
183,"00:10:43,277","00:10:45,378","Uh, what are you doing here?"
184,"00:10:45,380","00:10:48,214","I was just checking on the honeymoon
suite, and I heard something."
185,"00:10:48,216","00:10:50,316","Oh, I'm sorry,
my little bedbug."
186,"00:10:50,318","00:10:52,485","I was just cleaning
the attic."
187,"00:10:58,025","00:11:00,125","It's so dirty, ah, yes..."
188,"00:11:00,127","00:11:02,227","- Who is that?
- Are you on the phone?"
189,"00:11:02,229","00:11:07,267","What, this? I was just
trying to find a maid"
190,"00:11:07,269","00:11:09,635","- to help me with the mess.
- A maid?"
191,"00:11:09,637","00:11:11,137",Who do you think...
192,"00:11:11,139","00:11:12,138","Thank you,
I'll check your references"
193,"00:11:12,140","00:11:13,909",and get back to you. Goodbye!
194,"00:11:18,045","00:11:19,144",Dad.
195,"00:11:19,146","00:11:20,946","Stop trying to
hide it from me."
196,"00:11:20,948","00:11:23,283","Hide? Who?
I mean, what? Me?"
197,"00:11:23,285","00:11:24,417",Yes.
198,"00:11:24,419","00:11:26,385",And I know what it is.

200,"00:11:28,290","00:11:31,023","You're stressed out
from working too hard."
201,"00:11:31,025","00:11:32,325",Oh!
202,"00:11:32,327","00:11:33,558","Okay, yes."

204,"00:11:35,096","00:11:37,230","It's a big hotel,
you know?"
205,"00:11:37,232","00:11:38,965",Can't get to everything.
206,"00:11:38,967","00:11:40,099",But what about you?

208,"00:11:42,102","00:11:45,404","I know. It seems like now that
we're working together more,"
209,"00:11:45,406","00:11:47,974","we're seeing
each other less."
210,"00:11:47,976","00:11:50,275","Ah. Yeah.
You're absolutely right."
211,"00:11:50,277","00:11:53,211","I am working too much,
you're working too much."
212,"00:11:53,213","00:11:56,316","We should really take a break,
starting right now."
213,"00:11:56,318","00:11:57,486",Night-night.
214,"00:12:02,390","00:12:03,456",I'm still here!

223,"00:12:34,222","00:12:36,022",We need a break.
224,"00:12:36,024","00:12:39,091","We need to all be together
again, like a family."
225,"00:12:39,093","00:12:40,362",Like we used to.
226,"00:12:43,397","00:12:46,132","Are you
overworked and stressed out?"

something about an accent"
400,"00:23:47,961","00:23:51,362","that makes a man
sound so intelligent."

it's nice to meet you."

""alibooboo"" to you as well."
405,"00:24:00,440","00:24:03,975","- Alibooboo. Alibooboo.

406,"00:24:03,977","00:24:05,910","Wait. I've always wanted
to do this."

458,"00:27:43,197","00:27:45,500","Okay. Thank you

461,"00:28:17,230","00:28:21,300","Ugh! You were so right,
Great-Grandfather."
462,"00:28:21,302","00:28:24,202",Monsters are disgusting!
463,"00:28:24,204","00:28:26,140",They're animals!
464,"00:28:43,090","00:28:45,122",I'll be right there.
465,"00:28:52,999","00:28:55,333","Dracula, is he on board?"
466,"00:28:55,335","00:28:58,637","Yes. I saw him.
Face-to-face. Ugh!"
467,"00:28:58,639","00:29:00,272",I was so nice to him.
468,"00:29:00,274","00:29:02,573","That pale face of his
and his goofy smile,"
469,"00:29:02,575","00:29:04,275",showing off his fangs.
470,"00:29:04,277","00:29:06,078","Argh, it's just like
you taught me!"
471,"00:29:06,080","00:29:08,647",It's even worse than I feared!
472,"00:29:08,649","00:29:11,750","It was that fateful night
that I realized"
473,"00:29:11,752","00:29:15,353","a human could never defeat
a monster."
474,"00:29:19,493","00:29:23,328","But I wouldn't let
our family legacy die."
475,"00:29:23,330","00:29:28,300","And so, I began to search
for an answer."
476,"00:29:28,302","00:29:33,571","And I saw it in an ancient text,
an instrument of destruction"
477,"00:29:33,573","00:29:36,108","so powerful
it destroyed Atlantis,"
478,"00:29:36,110","00:29:40,012",a whole city of monsters.
479,"00:29:40,014","00:29:44,282","And there, deep within the
rubble, it lay, waiting."
480,"00:29:44,284","00:29:48,085","Endlessly, I searched
for the lost city"
481,"00:29:48,087","00:29:51,590","Time passed, and my body
began to fail me."
482,"00:29:51,592","00:29:54,191","Oh, it was so sad, Ericka."
483,"00:29:54,193","00:29:56,695","First my liver,
then my spleen,"
484,"00:29:56,697","00:29:59,363",followed by a kidney or two.
485,"00:29:59,365","00:30:03,034",Then my golden locks.
486,"00:30:03,036","00:30:05,570","But I wouldn't let
that stop me."
487,"00:30:05,572","00:30:10,542","I replaced my failing organs
with technology!"
488,"00:30:10,544","00:30:12,244",Ha-ha!
489,"00:30:12,246","00:30:14,146",And look at me now.
490,"00:30:14,148","00:30:15,746",Mmm-hmm!
491,"00:30:15,748","00:30:18,618","Oh, girl,
it's an improvement, really."
492,"00:30:19,719","00:30:22,053","Um, sure."
493,"00:30:22,055","00:30:27,725","And now, after 120 years,
I have finally found Atlantis."
494,"00:30:27,727","00:30:29,561","Oh, forget about all this!"
495,"00:30:29,563","00:30:31,162","Let me get rid of
Dracula right now."
496,"00:30:31,164","00:30:32,798","I was so close to him,
I could've just..."
497,"00:30:34,700","00:30:37,369","No, no, no!"
498,"00:30:37,371","00:30:39,404","We have to
stick to the plan."
499,"00:30:39,406","00:30:41,273","Lure the monsters
to Atlantis,"
500,"00:30:41,275","00:30:43,641","retrieve the instrument
of destruction,"
501,"00:30:43,643","00:30:46,511","trap them there,
and then wipe them out."
502,"00:30:46,513","00:30:48,346","It's simple, Ericka!"
503,"00:30:48,348","00:30:51,416","Now, promise me you won't
try and kill Dracula."
504,"00:30:51,418","00:30:52,818","Ugh, fine!"
505,"00:30:52,820","00:30:55,253","- I promise.
- Promise what?"
506,"00:30:55,255","00:30:58,790","I promise I won't
try and kill Dracula. Okay?"
507,"00:31:03,529","00:31:05,330",Ugh.
508,"00:31:05,332","00:31:09,400","Don't worry, Great-Grandfather,
I won't try and kill him..."
509,"00:31:09,402","00:31:11,171",I will kill him.
510,"00:31:37,898","00:31:39,363",Whew!
511,"00:32:13,833","00:32:15,402",Ugh!
512,"00:32:23,310","00:32:24,645",Oh!
513,"00:32:52,939","00:32:54,939","Work it, Dracula."
514,"00:32:54,941","00:32:56,643",You know it.
515,"00:32:57,811","00:33:00,477","Oh! Lookin' good, Drac!"
516,"00:33:00,479","00:33:01,846","Feeling good, Frank."
517,"00:33:01,848","00:33:04,416","Look at you, so fancy!"
518,"00:33:04,418","00:33:05,984",What? This? Please.
519,"00:33:05,986","00:33:07,985","Ooh! Dressed to impress, huh?"
520,"00:33:07,987","00:33:09,620","""Impress""? Oh."
521,"00:33:09,622","00:33:11,523",Who do I need to impress?
522,"00:33:11,525","00:33:13,390","Hey, isn't that
Captain Ericka?"
523,"00:33:13,392","00:33:14,959","Oh, no!"
524,"00:33:14,961","00:33:17,294","Uh, what? Eh, oh..."
525,"00:33:17,296","00:33:18,696","Oops, no,
not her."
526,"00:33:20,266","00:33:21,899","Ooh, that's good!"
527,"00:33:21,901","00:33:23,001",Very amusing.
528,"00:33:32,411","00:33:35,312","Sorry, Drac. You know, it's just
we've never seen you like this."
529,"00:33:35,314","00:33:36,548",I know.
530,"00:33:36,550","00:33:37,948",It doesn't make any sense.
531,"00:33:37,950","00:33:40,685","You can't Zing twice,
it's impossible!"
532,"00:33:40,687","00:33:42,987",But I did! So now what?
533,"00:33:42,989","00:33:45,657",And what about Mavis?
534,"00:33:45,659","00:33:47,792","She wants you
to be happy, right?"
535,"00:33:47,794","00:33:50,629","I'm sure she'll go
with the flow."

537,"00:33:52,365","00:33:54,832","Mavis needs me.
She depends on me."
538,"00:33:54,834","00:33:57,901","I need to be home
with my family."

586,"00:36:41,834","00:36:43,535","Oh, yes, yes, yes."
587,"00:36:43,537","00:36:46,171","I'm just here
to have family fun."
588,"00:36:46,173","00:36:48,476","Family, family, fun, fun."
589,"00:37:10,095","00:37:12,532","Hmm, let's see.
What about here?"
590,"00:37:33,086","00:37:35,089","Right this way, everyone."
591,"00:37:47,166","00:37:51,135","Welcome to one of the true wonders
of the underwater kingdom."
592,"00:37:51,137","00:37:54,671",I give you Volcano del Fuego.
593,"00:37:54,673","00:37:56,974","Or, as the local sea life
call it..."
594,"00:38:56,970","00:38:58,836",Whee!
595,"00:39:53,392","00:39:54,925","Aw, what a cute family."
596,"00:39:54,927","00:39:55,994","What? No, it's not."
597,"00:39:55,996","00:39:57,831",Argh! Dracula bad!
598,"00:41:12,738","00:41:14,104","Frank, we just ate."
599,"00:41:14,106","00:41:16,274","I can't believe
you're hungry already."
600,"00:41:16,276","00:41:18,008","I'm sorry.
You know what it is?"
601,"00:41:18,010","00:41:19,943","It's all... Just all that
seafood just swimming around,"
602,"00:41:19,945","00:41:21,912","and when I ""see food..."""
603,"00:41:21,914","00:41:25,015","Oh, man! I'm gone."
604,"00:41:25,017","00:41:27,952","Oh! Dracula, Dracula, Dracula!"
605,"00:41:27,954","00:41:30,021","Dracula, Dracula!"
606,"00:41:30,023","00:41:33,124","I get so close, but it's
almost like he's teasing me."
607,"00:41:33,126","00:41:35,358","I just, I can't
stand it anymore."
608,"00:41:35,360","00:41:36,663",I have to get him!
609,"00:41:47,439","00:41:50,874","Boy, that underwater volcano
looked hot."
610,"00:41:50,876","00:41:52,746",Mmm-hmm.
611,"00:41:56,448","00:41:58,381","Oh... Hi, Bob."
612,"00:41:58,383","00:42:02,352","Right. We promised you we'd
play, uh, ping-pong now."
613,"00:42:02,354","00:42:04,921","Um, Dennis?
Who is this?"
614,"00:42:04,923","00:42:06,990","Uh, it's our friend, Bob."
615,"00:42:06,992","00:42:08,828","- Say hi, Bob.
- ""Hi, Bob."""
616,"00:42:10,296","00:42:13,296","Okay! Time to go
play ping-pong."
617,"00:42:13,298","00:42:14,432","- Drac!
- Drac!"
618,"00:42:14,434","00:42:17,037","- Drac!
- Drac!"
619,"00:42:18,872","00:42:21,071","Hey, boys,
where's the fire?"
620,"00:42:21,073","00:42:22,439","Oh, well,
Griffin here, he..."
621,"00:42:22,441","00:42:24,809","- He has something to tell you.
- Me? Uh..."
622,"00:42:24,811","00:42:27,178","Oh. Yeah, I got this bite on
my hand, and since, you know,"
623,"00:42:27,180","00:42:29,479","you're a biting expert, I
thought you could take a look."
624,"00:42:29,481","00:42:31,401","- Yeah. Come on over here.
- The light is better."
625,"00:42:32,284","00:42:33,820",Okay...
626,"00:42:35,521","00:42:37,921","Okay, what is going on?"
627,"00:42:37,923","00:42:40,957","You guys are acting weirder than normal,
and your normal is pretty weird."
628,"00:42:40,959","00:42:42,959","You are not gonna believe
what we heard, but..."
629,"00:42:57,010","00:42:59,443","Shh. I told you I don't
want to upset Mavis."
630,"00:42:59,445","00:43:02,180",But what are you talking about?
631,"00:43:02,182","00:43:04,481","Okay, well, see, Frank got
hungry, so no surprise there..."
632,"00:43:04,483","00:43:08,352","But we swam back to the ship, and
we found Ericka raving about you."
633,"00:43:08,354","00:43:10,187","She can't live
without you, buddy."
634,"00:43:10,189","00:43:11,923",It's serious!
635,"00:43:15,961","00:43:19,363","So, Drac, this is great. Are you gonna
make a move on the captain, or what?"
636,"00:43:19,365","00:43:20,997","Uh, yes."
637,"00:43:20,999","00:43:23,501","- Maybe? No.
- Ugh."
638,"00:43:23,503","00:43:26,838","It's been a while. I don't
even know where to start."
639,"00:43:26,840","00:43:29,240","It's easy, Drac.
Just make some small talk."
640,"00:43:29,242","00:43:31,075","- Remember to smile.
- Look into her eyes."
641,"00:43:31,077","00:43:33,077","- Keep it casual.
- Say something funny."
642,"00:43:33,079","00:43:34,345","Ask her where
her parts are from."
643,"00:43:34,347","00:43:36,046","Oh, and say
that her wrappings look nice."
644,"00:43:36,048","00:43:37,849","- ""Do you like coffins?""
- Compliment her."
645,"00:43:37,851","00:43:39,850","- ""Your neck looks delicious.""
- Here she comes."
646,"00:43:39,852","00:43:42,253","Okay, Drac,
hit it."
647,"00:43:42,255","00:43:44,454","Your delicious neck wrappings
are in a nice coffin."
648,"00:43:44,456","00:43:47,358","Would you like
to see my parts?"
649,"00:43:50,162","00:43:52,262","Yes, I'd love to go out
with you."
650,"00:43:52,264","00:43:53,497",Ay! What?
651,"00:43:53,499","00:43:54,631",What?
652,"00:43:54,633","00:43:56,032",Cantina. Midnight.
653,"00:43:56,034","00:43:57,103",Don't be late.
654,"00:44:06,880","00:44:08,079",Whew!
655,"00:44:08,081","00:44:09,448",That was a close one.
656,"00:44:13,086","00:44:15,823","- Wait! Stop it, Tinkles, stop!
- Wait, Tinkles. Come back."
657,"00:44:25,664","00:44:27,164","- Tinkles, stop!
- Wait!"
658,"00:44:27,166","00:44:28,302","No, no, no!"
659,"00:44:41,514","00:44:42,646","Tinkles, stop!"
660,"00:44:42,648","00:44:45,115",I've been found!
661,"00:44:45,117","00:44:48,119","You'll never get me, monster!"
662,"00:44:48,121","00:44:50,620","Shh! Tinkles, stop.
Shh! Shh!"
663,"00:45:04,369","00:45:05,872",Ew.
664,"00:45:14,981","00:45:20,450","Everybody, we are pulling up
to our next stop, the Deserted Island."
665,"00:45:20,452","00:45:22,720","It's time to get lost
on the beach,"
666,"00:45:22,722","00:45:28,128","and we hope you'll find yourself
some fun and relaxation."
667,"00:45:29,461","00:45:31,628","Whoo-hoo!
Beach time!"
668,"00:45:31,630","00:45:33,463","Johnny, you go
set everything up."
669,"00:45:33,465","00:45:35,399","And, Dad, you go get in
line for the snow cones."
670,"00:45:35,401","00:45:38,169","You know, actually,
I was thinking you and Johnny"
671,"00:45:38,171","00:45:40,003","should spend
some time together."
672,"00:45:40,005","00:45:42,439","What do you call it again?
Eh, date night?"
673,"00:45:42,441","00:45:43,974",Date night?
674,"00:45:43,976","00:45:45,742","- What are you gonna do?
- Well, I thought"
675,"00:45:45,744","00:45:48,111","me and the guys would
take this opportunity"
676,"00:45:48,113","00:45:51,215","to spend some quality time
with Dennis."
677,"00:45:51,217","00:45:53,084","Oh. Okay.
That's a great idea."
678,"00:45:53,086","00:45:54,751","Come on, Johnny.
Date night."
679,"00:45:54,753","00:45:57,523",Duh-duh-duh-duh-date night!
680,"00:46:12,405","00:46:14,204","Okay, here you go!"
681,"00:46:19,345","00:46:21,148","- Good girl!
- I got this one."
682,"00:46:30,188","00:46:31,689",What was that?
683,"00:46:31,691","00:46:33,590",It sounds like our children.
684,"00:46:33,592","00:46:36,427","- It is our children! Run!
- Run!"
685,"00:46:36,429","00:46:38,495",Please! Help! Someone!
686,"00:46:38,497","00:46:40,463",Get the parents!
687,"00:46:40,465","00:46:43,401","Frank? Would you rub
some moonscreen on my back"
688,"00:46:43,403","00:46:45,035",before I get burned?
689,"00:46:45,037","00:46:46,236","Wait one second, honey."
690,"00:46:46,238","00:46:47,838","You know, the kids buried me
in the sand."
691,"00:46:54,079","00:46:55,745","Mmm. Thanks, honey."
692,"00:46:55,747","00:46:58,249","- Shall we have another?
- Sure."
693,"00:46:58,251","00:47:01,584","- Sounds good.
- Straight up."
694,"00:47:01,586","00:47:03,720",Isn't this place amazing?
695,"00:47:03,722","00:47:06,724",Whoa! The menu is in a bottle!
696,"00:47:06,726","00:47:08,628","Genius! Isn't that
awesome, honey?"
697,"00:47:11,130","00:47:12,762","What? Oh, sorry."
698,"00:47:12,764","00:47:14,765","I was just thinking
about my dad."
699,"00:47:14,767","00:47:17,668","Don't you think
he's acting weird lately?"
700,"00:47:17,670","00:47:21,104","Not really. Besides having
a huge crush on the captain."
701,"00:47:21,106","00:47:23,073","- What?
- Oh, yeah."
702,"00:47:23,075","00:47:25,642","The Love Boat is definitely
making another run."
703,"00:47:25,644","00:47:27,410",No way. He's...
704,"00:47:27,412","00:47:29,680",He's my dad.
705,"00:47:29,682","00:47:31,481","I know, right? It's weird."
706,"00:47:31,483","00:47:35,318","When my parents kiss,
I still close my eyes."
707,"00:47:35,320","00:47:40,624","I guess I never thought about
him with anyone besides my mom."
708,"00:47:40,626","00:47:43,126","You're cool with it,
though, right?"
709,"00:47:43,128","00:47:45,262","Of course. I want him
to be happy."
710,"00:47:45,264","00:47:46,266",Totally.
711,"00:47:48,334","00:47:50,166",Totally.
712,"00:47:56,409","00:47:58,876","Buenas noches, mi amigo."
713,"00:47:58,878","00:48:04,881","Have you a beverage
to quench me of my parchment?"
714,"00:48:04,883","00:48:07,387","Yes, of course,
Mr. Chupacabra."
715,"00:48:11,289","00:48:13,226",Muchas gracias.
716,"00:48:29,175","00:48:30,508",You look ravishing.
717,"00:48:30,510","00:48:31,608",Oh.
718,"00:48:31,610","00:48:32,809","Uh, thank you. I just..."
719,"00:48:32,811","00:48:34,313",Oh.
720,"00:48:43,356","00:48:45,222","So, um..."
721,"00:48:45,224","00:48:48,291","Does Captain Ericka
have a last name?"
722,"00:48:48,293","00:48:49,760","Uh, oh, uh..."
723,"00:48:49,762","00:48:51,896","Oh, guacamole!"
724,"00:48:51,898","00:48:53,430","""Ericka Guacamole""?"
725,"00:48:53,432","00:48:56,767",That's so international.
726,"00:48:56,769","00:49:00,570","No.
Guacamole for us to share."
727,"00:49:00,572","00:49:02,939","Oh, how beautiful
is that full moon tonight?"
728,"00:49:02,941","00:49:04,376",Look. Right behind you.
729,"00:49:08,780","00:49:12,249","Mmm! The food here
is to die for."
730,"00:49:22,894","00:49:26,829","Holy moly, that was
a lot of guacamole."
731,"00:49:26,831","00:49:29,200",Are you feeling all right?
732,"00:49:29,202","00:49:31,869","- Totally fine. Why?
- No reason."
733,"00:49:33,738","00:49:35,405",Oh...
734,"00:49:35,407","00:49:38,841","There must have been garlic
in the guacamole."
735,"00:49:38,843","00:49:40,376","Oh, no."
736,"00:49:40,378","00:49:41,845","Isn't that deadly
for you?"
737,"00:49:41,847","00:49:43,816","No, no, no.
It's just that I'm..."
738,"00:49:44,749","00:49:46,418",Garlic intolerant.
739,"00:49:54,726","00:49:55,895",Was that you?
740,"00:49:57,729","00:50:00,497",Whoo!
741,"00:50:00,499","00:50:01,731","Oh, yeah!"
742,"00:50:01,733","00:50:03,934",Dolphin surfing!
743,"00:50:11,510","00:50:12,642",Whoa!
744,"00:50:12,644","00:50:14,577","Hi, Mama. Hi, Papa."
745,"00:50:14,579","00:50:15,713",Hey-hey.
746,"00:50:15,715","00:50:17,448",Oh! Hey there.
747,"00:50:17,450","00:50:19,450","- Papa.
- Hidey-ho!"
748,"00:50:19,452","00:50:20,651",Hi.
749,"00:50:20,653","00:50:23,019","Is my dad
in there, too?"
750,"00:50:25,358","00:50:27,624","Don't worry,
I'm over here. Bleh, bleh-bleh."
751,"00:50:27,626","00:50:31,664","No, Papa Drac's not here.
He's on his date."
752,"00:50:32,430","00:50:33,532",Date?
753,"00:50:36,434","00:50:38,901","Please, forgive me,"
754,"00:50:38,903","00:50:40,604",I'm just very nervous.
755,"00:50:40,606","00:50:42,573","You see,"
756,"00:50:42,575","00:50:47,814","I haven't had a date
since my wife died."
757,"00:50:49,849","00:50:51,782",How old was your daughter?
758,"00:50:51,784","00:50:53,751",She was just an infant.
759,"00:50:53,753","00:50:55,718","It was hard
being a single dad,"
760,"00:50:55,720","00:50:58,257",but I did my best.
761,"00:51:00,925","00:51:03,693","I never knew
my mother, either."
762,"00:51:03,695","00:51:04,861",Or my father.
763,"00:51:04,863","00:51:07,064","Oh, I'm so sorry."
764,"00:51:07,066","00:51:08,599",Who raised you?
765,"00:51:08,601","00:51:10,668",My great-grandfather.
766,"00:51:10,670","00:51:13,370","I basically grew up
on this ship."
767,"00:51:13,372","00:51:15,606","That's why
you're a captain."
768,"00:51:15,608","00:51:18,876","Yeah. It's all
I've ever known."
769,"00:51:18,878","00:51:21,381",It was just expected.
770,"00:51:22,347","00:51:23,847","You know, a family thing."
771,"00:51:23,849","00:51:27,785","I understand,
family is everything."
772,"00:51:27,787","00:51:30,553",You have to honor the past.
773,"00:51:30,555","00:51:32,825",But we make our own future.
774,"00:51:46,072","00:51:48,071","- Dad?
- Mavis!"
775,"00:51:48,073","00:51:50,610","- Mmm.
- Johnny!"
776,"00:51:52,977","00:51:58,015","Captain Ericka and I were just
discussing the hospitality industry."
777,"00:51:58,017","00:52:00,084","You know,
just work stuff."
778,"00:52:00,086","00:52:01,651",You're working now?
779,"00:52:01,653","00:52:03,553","This is supposed to be
a vacation."
780,"00:52:03,555","00:52:04,954",A family vacation.
781,"00:52:04,956","00:52:08,591","I should really go
do captain-y things."
782,"00:52:08,593","00:52:11,628","Dad, you said you were
gonna spend time with Dennis."
783,"00:52:11,630","00:52:14,832",Dennis. Dennis? Dennis.
784,"00:52:14,834","00:52:17,600","Oh! Yeah, you're right.
Where is that kid?"
785,"00:52:17,602","00:52:20,137","Denisovich? You're
supposed to be with me."
786,"00:52:20,139","00:52:22,405","Come on now, kid,
it's family time."
787,"00:52:22,407","00:52:23,909",Quit hiding. Dennis?
788,"00:52:25,477","00:52:26,677",What was that about?
789,"00:52:26,679","00:52:27,977","You mean
your dad's date?"
790,"00:52:27,979","00:52:30,981","It wasn't a date.
It was work stuff."
791,"00:52:30,983","00:52:32,149",Uh-huh.
792,"00:52:32,151","00:52:33,983","I'm telling you, Johnny,"
793,"00:52:33,985","00:52:35,818","there is something about
that woman I don't trust."
794,"00:52:35,820","00:52:38,921","But you want your dad
to be happy, right?"
795,"00:52:38,923","00:52:40,423",Yes.
796,"00:52:40,425","00:52:42,459",Just not with her.
797,"00:52:42,461","00:52:44,160","Mmm.
Whoo-hoo-hoo!"
798,"00:52:44,162","00:52:45,595","Heads up, honey."
799,"00:52:45,597","00:52:47,765","This guac is loaded
with garlic."
800,"00:52:47,767","00:52:48,835",Garlic?
801,"00:52:55,573","00:52:57,876","Aw! That was
a cute toot, honey."
802,"00:53:15,160","00:53:17,995","- We've been up all night!
- Let's stay up all day, too!"
803,"00:53:17,997","00:53:19,896",Let's get wild!
804,"00:53:32,610","00:53:34,611","- Ericka!
- What?"
805,"00:53:34,613","00:53:37,981","Just where have you been, young lady?"
806,"00:53:37,983","00:53:40,450","Uh, doing work."
807,"00:53:40,452","00:53:42,452",Wearing that?
808,"00:53:42,454","00:53:44,988","You were with him!
I know it!"
809,"00:53:44,990","00:53:46,957",Who?
810,"00:53:46,959","00:53:49,091","""Who?"" You know who!"
811,"00:53:49,093","00:53:51,662","You've been sneaking around
my back"
812,"00:53:51,664","00:53:54,997","trying to kill Dracula again,
haven't you?"
813,"00:53:54,999","00:53:57,800","So what if I have?
I am a grown woman!"
814,"00:53:57,802","00:53:59,102","I have the right to kill
whoever I want."
815,"00:53:59,104","00:54:01,571",It's not just about you.
816,"00:54:01,573","00:54:04,874","You could have ruined
the legacy."
817,"00:54:04,876","00:54:07,644","What if he discovered
who you were?"
818,"00:54:07,646","00:54:10,948","I know. I wasn't thinking.
There's just something about him"
819,"00:54:10,950","00:54:12,883",that just drives me crazy!
820,"00:54:12,885","00:54:15,017","I just, I see him,
and I want to..."
821,"00:54:15,019","00:54:16,153",Punch him?
822,"00:54:16,155","00:54:18,856",Uh... I guess.
823,"00:54:18,858","00:54:20,923","Just, I can't wait
to get this over with."
824,"00:54:20,925","00:54:23,160","Don't worry,
it won't be long now."
825,"00:54:23,162","00:54:26,597","Once you recover the
instrument of destruction,"
826,"00:54:26,599","00:54:28,599",no one can stop us.
827,"00:54:28,601","00:54:30,470",Not even Dracula!
828,"00:54:31,537","00:54:33,907","- Oh. Excuse me.
- Spies!"
829,"00:54:38,577","00:54:40,910","Now, quickly,
before someone comes!"
830,"00:55:02,034","00:55:04,668","Everyone assemble
on the forward deck."
831,"00:55:04,670","00:55:08,571","We are arriving
at our final destination."
832,"00:55:08,573","00:55:10,140","From the depths of creation,"
833,"00:55:10,142","00:55:13,876","the mighty city has risen
once again."
834,"00:55:13,878","00:55:16,680","Home to the greatest
monster civilization"
835,"00:55:16,682","00:55:18,582","the world has ever known,"
836,"00:55:18,584","00:55:23,287","far surpassing Athens and Rome in
art, culture and sophistication."
837,"00:55:23,289","00:55:28,628","I give you the legendary
lost city of Atlantis."
838,"00:55:53,751","00:55:56,919",It's a giant Kraken!
839,"00:56:43,001","00:56:45,968",Welcome to Atlantis!
840,"00:56:50,876","00:56:51,878",Oh!
841,"00:57:05,858","00:57:07,990",Ooh. I am so excited!
842,"00:57:07,992","00:57:09,295",Come to Daddy!
843,"00:57:11,930","00:57:13,296","- Oh.
- Twenty-eight black!"
844,"00:57:14,867","00:57:15,867",Oh!
845,"00:57:17,869","00:57:20,370","- Ahhh!
- Oh, no, you don't."
846,"00:57:20,372","00:57:23,372","Last time you gambled, you lost
an arm and a leg. Literally!"
847,"00:57:23,374","00:57:25,374","- Replacement limbs...
- I'll raise you 40."
848,"00:57:25,376","00:57:27,843","...aren't just lying around
like they were in the old days."
849,"00:57:27,845","00:57:30,146","So, no gambling."
850,"00:57:30,148","00:57:31,280",Frank!
851,"00:57:31,282","00:57:33,218","Yes, dear! Got it!
No gambling!"
852,"00:57:39,758","00:57:41,425","- Tinkles, stop.
- Wait."
853,"00:57:41,427","00:57:43,727","- Stop it, Tinkles, stop.
- Ah! Wait!"
854,"00:57:47,231","00:57:49,265","Have you guys seen Mavis?
I have to find her."
855,"00:57:49,267","00:57:50,767",Why? What's going on?
856,"00:57:50,769","00:57:52,803","I'm going to tell her
about Ericka."
857,"00:57:52,805","00:57:55,271","I can't lie to
my own daughter anymore."
858,"00:57:55,273","00:57:58,175","She's the most important
person in the world to me."
859,"00:57:58,177","00:58:00,179",I have to tell her the truth.
860,"00:58:02,380","00:58:04,216",Right after I talk to Ericka.
861,"00:58:06,485","00:58:07,687",Hey.
862,"00:58:09,921","00:58:11,253","All right, I'm all..."
863,"00:58:11,255","00:58:13,323","Frank, are you sure
you know what you're doing?"
864,"00:58:13,325","00:58:16,029",I got this. I'm all in.
865,"00:58:19,197","00:58:21,131","Johnny, have you seen
my dad?"
866,"00:58:21,133","00:58:23,867","- Maybe he's with Bob.
- Why would he be with Bob?"
867,"00:58:23,869","00:58:25,869",Bob's a great guy.
868,"00:58:25,871","00:58:27,939","- Oh, there he is.
- Who? Bob?"
869,"00:58:45,289","00:58:48,191","There he is!
Hi, Bob!"
870,"01:00:13,579","01:00:14,781",Oh.
871,"01:01:27,218","01:01:28,421",There it is.
872,"01:01:46,938","01:01:48,405",You saved my life.
873,"01:01:48,407","01:01:50,340","Of course.
Why wouldn't I?"
874,"01:01:50,342","01:01:53,977","I just can't believe you
would do that for a human."
875,"01:01:53,979","01:01:57,012","Humans, monsters,
what's the difference?"
876,"01:01:57,014","01:02:00,050","Yeah, right. Right."
877,"01:02:00,052","01:02:02,285",Wait. What are you doing here?
878,"01:02:02,287","01:02:06,122","Oh, uh... Well, you know,
vampires can predict the future,"
879,"01:02:06,124","01:02:09,158","so I knew you would
need my help."
880,"01:02:09,160","01:02:11,394",Ha! Never heard that before.
881,"01:02:11,396","01:02:13,463","Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
It's a well-known fact."
882,"01:02:14,666","01:02:16,332",What are you doing here?
883,"01:02:16,334","01:02:17,466",Oh! Uh...
884,"01:02:17,468","01:02:19,568","Well, I'm here to get that."
885,"01:02:19,570","01:02:21,537","Yeah, it's a family heirloom."
886,"01:02:21,539","01:02:26,175","Yeah, it was lost at sea, and
my great-grandfather is... Was!"
887,"01:02:26,177","01:02:29,512","Uh, was totally obsessed
with getting it back."
888,"01:02:29,514","01:02:33,952","So, anywho, thanks for saving my
life, but I can take it from..."
889,"01:02:39,691","01:02:41,224","Got to be
a little more careful."
890,"01:02:41,226","01:02:43,126","How many times
can you save my life, right?"
891,"01:02:43,128","01:02:45,595",I don't know. Every time?
892,"01:02:45,597","01:02:48,167","Really? Well, then..."
893,"01:03:22,733","01:03:24,069",Wow!
894,"01:03:41,586","01:03:44,557","Ah,
that was incredible."
895,"01:03:55,733","01:03:57,367","Oh, uh..."
896,"01:03:57,369","01:04:00,472","Don't you want to get
your family heirloom thingy?"
897,"01:04:01,305","01:04:03,108",Oh. Right.
898,"01:04:08,380","01:04:10,546",Got it.
899,"01:04:39,410","01:04:41,410",Mmm.
900,"01:04:41,412","01:04:43,278","Oh, here, let me get
that for you."
901,"01:04:45,550","01:04:46,718",Dad!
902,"01:04:47,885","01:04:49,651",Mavis!
903,"01:04:49,653","01:04:51,454","What are you doing
to my father?"
904,"01:04:51,456","01:04:53,423",Wait! Whoa. Whoa!
905,"01:04:53,425","01:04:55,691","Mavis, stop!
Put her down!"
906,"01:04:55,693","01:04:59,195","No! She's trying to hurt you.
Why can't you see that?"
907,"01:05:00,599","01:05:03,465",Because I...
908,"01:05:03,467","01:05:05,702",Because I Zinged.
909,"01:05:05,704","01:05:07,202",What?
910,"01:05:07,204","01:05:09,741",I Zinged with Ericka.
911,"01:05:10,909","01:05:13,209","No, that can't be true."
912,"01:05:13,211","01:05:14,744",You only Zing once.
913,"01:05:14,746","01:05:17,379","That's what I thought, too."
914,"01:05:17,381","01:05:19,682","""Zing""? What's a Zing?"
915,"01:05:19,684","01:05:23,720","Uh, well, it's a thing
for monsters."
916,"01:05:23,722","01:05:26,523","It's kind of like
our ""love at first sight."""
917,"01:05:26,525","01:05:29,358","What? No. No, no, no."
918,"01:05:29,360","01:05:31,693","- You don't even know me.
- Well, not yet."
919,"01:05:31,695","01:05:34,196","- But we're just...
- No, you don't understand."
920,"01:05:34,198","01:05:35,731",I can't be with you.
921,"01:05:35,733","01:05:38,668","I could never be
with someone like you."
922,"01:05:38,670","01:05:39,805",I could never be with
923,"01:05:40,738","01:05:41,840",a monster.
924,"01:05:52,584","01:05:55,350","Dad, I'm so sorry."
925,"01:05:55,352","01:05:57,155","- I...
- It doesn't matter."
926,"01:05:59,456","01:06:01,192",You heard what she said.
927,"01:06:08,767","01:06:10,602",But a Zing never lies.
928,"01:06:24,883","01:06:26,852",Ha! You got it!
929,"01:06:27,952","01:06:29,387",Yes.
930,"01:06:33,624","01:06:36,325","Now that we have
the instrument of destruction,"
931,"01:06:36,327","01:06:39,262","our family legacy
will be fulfilled."
932,"01:06:39,264","01:06:43,765","But first, we'll draw them in
with a dance party!"
933,"01:06:43,767","01:06:46,468",I love to dance.
934,"01:07:00,418","01:07:01,985","Frank,
could you zip me up?"
935,"01:07:01,987","01:07:03,952",We're gonna be late.
936,"01:07:03,954","01:07:06,256",Where did you get those?
937,"01:07:06,258","01:07:08,457","Uh, see,
here's the funny thing."
938,"01:07:08,459","01:07:11,361","I lost my hands gambling,
but... It's no big deal!"
939,"01:07:11,363","01:07:13,428","Look, I got these
from the seafood buffet."
940,"01:07:13,430","01:07:15,798","Look at this. Clickety-click,
click, clack, clack, click, click."
941,"01:07:15,800","01:07:18,204","I kind of like 'em.
I like 'em."
942,"01:07:24,041","01:07:25,642",Mmm! Mmm! Mmm.
943,"01:07:25,644","01:07:27,443",Mmm. Mmm.
944,"01:07:27,445","01:07:28,581",A-ha!
945,"01:07:52,037","01:07:53,870","Ah, I guess the party's
this way."
946,"01:07:53,872","01:07:54,872",Whoo!
947,"01:07:55,939","01:07:57,409",Whoa!
948,"01:08:06,751","01:08:07,753",Wow.
949,"01:08:10,454","01:08:13,021","Let's get this party
started right!"
950,"01:08:13,023","01:08:14,490","- Whoo-hoo!
- All right!"
951,"01:08:14,492","01:08:15,612",What?
952,"01:08:16,860","01:08:18,460",Huh?
953,"01:08:18,462","01:08:21,464","I thought they said
the party was this way."
954,"01:08:47,792","01:08:49,991",DJ in a clamshell?
955,"01:08:49,993","01:08:52,495",I'm so jealous.
956,"01:09:39,144","01:09:43,112","I can't believe my dad Zinged with
someone who's trying to kill him."
957,"01:09:43,114","01:09:45,514","Yeah, the Zing
makes you do crazy things."
958,"01:09:45,516","01:09:47,750","Really, Johnny?"
959,"01:09:47,752","01:09:52,522","What's most important to understand
is that love is an infinite enigma"
960,"01:09:52,524","01:09:54,790","that is beyond
our understanding."
961,"01:09:54,792","01:09:58,161","You and I were two halves,
a world apart."
962,"01:09:58,163","01:10:01,197","But then we followed
the strands of destiny"
963,"01:10:01,199","01:10:02,964",and were brought together.
964,"01:10:02,966","01:10:05,934",And our halves made one whole.
965,"01:10:05,936","01:10:08,137",But what if she and he...
966,"01:10:08,139","01:10:11,706","You must release all the
negativity and look within."
967,"01:10:11,708","01:10:13,746",Your bond is unbreakable.
968,"01:10:15,880","01:10:17,947","You're right, honey. Wow."
969,"01:10:17,949","01:10:19,448",Thanks.
970,"01:10:19,450","01:10:21,817","Whoa, you sounded
pretty smart, Dad."
971,"01:10:21,819","01:10:23,853","Oh, that? Yeah, it was
just the philosophy"
972,"01:10:23,855","01:10:26,621","of Sifu Sing from my favorite
TV show when I was a kid,"
973,"01:10:26,623","01:10:28,223",Kung Fu Shaolin Monk Master.
974,"01:10:28,225","01:10:29,892","Anyways, let's get back
to dancing!"
975,"01:10:29,894","01:10:31,029",Cool.
976,"01:10:35,199","01:10:37,767","Dad? You have to talk
to Ericka."
977,"01:10:37,769","01:10:38,867","- What?
- I know."
978,"01:10:38,869","01:10:40,702","I know what I said before,"
979,"01:10:40,704","01:10:43,572","but maybe I overreacted
a teensy bit."
980,"01:10:43,574","01:10:45,875","It's just the thought
of losing you."
981,"01:10:45,877","01:10:49,010","What? What are you talking
about, losing me?"
982,"01:10:49,012","01:10:51,046","Well, obviously,
after you get married,"
983,"01:10:51,048","01:10:53,014","you're gonna live on the ship
and travel around the world..."
984,"01:10:53,016","01:10:55,617","Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Slow down, Mavis."
985,"01:10:55,619","01:10:57,853","There are two things
I can promise you."
986,"01:10:57,855","01:11:03,692","One, nothing can ever take me
from you and all my family."
987,"01:11:03,694","01:11:06,965","Two, I will never live
on a boat."
988,"01:11:09,501","01:11:11,968","You're my cute
little tarantula."
989,"01:11:11,970","01:11:14,103",How could I ever leave you?
990,"01:11:14,105","01:11:16,104","Now, seriously,
go talk to her."
991,"01:11:16,106","01:11:18,508","I can't. You heard
what she said,"
992,"01:11:18,510","01:11:21,210","she could never be
with someone like me."
993,"01:11:21,212","01:11:23,545","No, Dad.
You're just a half,"
994,"01:11:23,547","01:11:27,049","and you have to follow your destiny
to find an infinite whole."
995,"01:11:27,051","01:11:28,884",You sound like Johnny.
996,"01:11:28,886","01:11:31,786","Point is,
you can't deny a Zing."
997,"01:11:31,788","01:11:34,557","Monster, human, unicorn..."
998,"01:11:34,559","01:11:35,627",It doesn't matter.
999,"01:11:36,293","01:11:38,596",So go to her! Now!
1000,"01:11:40,064","01:11:41,697",Okay. I'm on it.
1001,"01:11:43,200","01:11:44,733","Hey, man, you're
not allowed up here."
1002,"01:11:44,735","01:11:47,236",The DJ booth is a sacred space.
1003,"01:11:54,244","01:11:56,245","No. Tinkles, quiet."
1004,"01:11:56,247","01:11:57,780",Who is this?
1005,"01:11:57,782","01:12:02,183","Ha! I know you recognize me,
your greatest rival."
1006,"01:12:02,185","01:12:05,086","Hmm. Oh, right."
1007,"01:12:05,088","01:12:08,189","You own that Holiday Inn
down by the airport."
1008,"01:12:08,191","01:12:12,827","No! It is I,
Abraham Van Helsing."
1009,"01:12:12,829","01:12:14,296",Van Helsing?
1010,"01:12:14,298","01:12:16,165",After all these years?
1011,"01:12:16,167","01:12:18,070",You look awful.
1012,"01:12:19,304","01:12:22,271",Always with the quick insults.
1013,"01:12:22,273","01:12:24,807","Well, this will shut you up."
1014,"01:12:24,809","01:12:26,709",And all monsters.
1015,"01:12:26,711","01:12:30,746","Eh, huh? That's just Ericka's
family heirloom thingy."
1016,"01:12:30,748","01:12:33,249","Good one, Ericka."
1017,"01:12:33,251","01:12:34,783",Ericka?
1018,"01:12:34,785","01:12:36,152",You fool.
1019,"01:12:36,154","01:12:39,021","Not only is she
the ship's captain,"
1020,"01:12:39,023","01:12:40,923","but she also happens
to be..."
1021,"01:12:43,261","01:12:45,664",Wait. You tell him.
1022,"01:12:47,297","01:12:49,967",I'm his great-granddaughter.
1023,"01:12:51,301","01:12:54,036",I'm Ericka Van Helsing.
1024,"01:12:54,038","01:12:57,039","I knew there was
something wrong with her."
1025,"01:12:57,041","01:12:58,307",But...
1026,"01:12:58,309","01:13:01,110","See, what happened..."
1027,"01:13:01,112","01:13:03,144","Now that we're all caught up,"
1028,"01:13:03,146","01:13:05,982",let's get back to the dying.
1029,"01:13:05,984","01:13:11,387","Behold, the key to the demise
of all monsters."
1030,"01:13:23,900","01:13:25,201",Let's see.
1031,"01:13:25,203","01:13:27,836",Right... Okay.
1032,"01:13:30,908","01:13:33,075",Listen to the melody
1033,"01:13:33,077","01:13:34,947",of your destruction.
1034,"01:13:38,048","01:13:40,415","Ooh, what's this little
doodad do?"
1035,"01:13:41,752","01:13:43,287",Yeah!
1036,"01:14:05,743","01:14:08,013","Hey, look! It's the Kraken."
1037,"01:14:22,726","01:14:24,061",Everybody out! Now!
1038,"01:14:36,340","01:14:38,741",We're trapped! Everybody back!
1039,"01:15:00,131","01:15:02,066",Yay!
1040,"01:15:09,507","01:15:11,107",Baby!
1041,"01:15:11,109","01:15:12,774",Papa!
1042,"01:15:22,987","01:15:24,823",This has to stop now!
1043,"01:15:25,989","01:15:26,988","Drac, no!"
1044,"01:15:26,990","01:15:27,990",Ah!
1045,"01:15:40,971","01:15:42,071",Dad!
1046,"01:15:43,474","01:15:44,973",Mavis!
1047,"01:15:44,975","01:15:47,912","Time for the immortal Dracula
to die."
1048,"01:15:58,890","01:16:00,156",Dad!
1049,"01:16:06,197","01:16:07,231",No!
1050,"01:16:08,832","01:16:09,867",Ericka!
1051,"01:16:14,005","01:16:15,271",Bob! Help!
1052,"01:16:15,273","01:16:16,475",Huh?
1053,"01:16:19,877","01:16:21,009",Tinkles?
1054,"01:16:21,011","01:16:22,178",Dennis.
1055,"01:16:22,180","01:16:24,880","Oh, no.
Bob is Tinkles?"
1056,"01:16:24,882","01:16:26,281",How did he get here?
1057,"01:16:26,283","01:16:28,285","But thank goodness he did,
'cause look!"
1058,"01:17:09,226","01:17:10,491",You can't do this!
1059,"01:17:10,493","01:17:12,329","You're wrong
about monsters!"
1060,"01:17:13,497","01:17:16,365",Dracula... He saved my life.
1061,"01:17:16,367","01:17:17,633",What?
1062,"01:17:17,635","01:17:19,500","I'm so sorry, Drac."
1063,"01:17:19,502","01:17:21,970","I was trying to kill you
this whole time,"
1064,"01:17:21,972","01:17:24,540","but then I realized
how wrong I was."
1065,"01:17:24,542","01:17:26,578",How wrong all of this is.
1066,"01:17:28,078","01:17:29,945",And then I...
1067,"01:17:29,947","01:17:31,149",I Zinged.
1068,"01:17:32,416","01:17:34,349","""Zing""? What's a Zing?"
1069,"01:17:34,351","01:17:35,617",It's a monster thing.
1070,"01:17:35,619","01:17:37,419",You wouldn't understand.
1071,"01:17:37,421","01:17:40,022",It's like true love.
1072,"01:17:40,024","01:17:41,089",Love?
1073,"01:17:44,462","01:17:47,228","Well, I guess the legacy
ends with me."
1074,"01:17:47,230","01:17:49,164","Hmm, that's an awkward ending."
1075,"01:17:49,166","01:17:50,366",Nope!
1076,"01:17:50,368","01:17:53,004","It's time to start
a new legacy."
1077,"01:17:54,038","01:17:56,508",A monster-human legacy.
1078,"01:17:57,675","01:17:59,107",No!
1079,"01:18:05,349","01:18:09,285","Drac! Van Helsing's beats are
controlling the giant octopus thingy."
1080,"01:18:09,287","01:18:13,289","If there's one thing I hate,
it's an evil DJ."
1081,"01:18:13,291","01:18:16,194",We need positive energy!
1082,"01:18:22,399","01:18:25,533",Get ready for a DJ battle!
1083,"01:18:25,535","01:18:28,469","You just carry all that
stuff around with you?"
1084,"01:18:28,471","01:18:31,674","Once a bar mitzvah DJ,
always a bar mitzvah DJ."
1085,"01:18:31,676","01:18:35,544","We're gonna use good music
to defeat his evil music."
1086,"01:18:35,546","01:18:38,179","- What?
- Trust me, I know the tunes,"
1087,"01:18:38,181","01:18:40,081",but you've got the power.
1088,"01:18:40,083","01:18:42,116",All right. Okay.
1089,"01:18:42,118","01:18:45,387","Opening song needs to
be off the shizak."
1090,"01:18:45,389","01:18:47,492","Ooh, got it. Play this!"
1091,"01:19:08,546","01:19:10,411",What is that noise?
1092,"01:19:14,985","01:19:16,384",Wow! I like this one.
1093,"01:19:16,386","01:19:18,219",This feels good.
1094,"01:19:20,291","01:19:22,323",The fool.
1095,"01:19:46,417","01:19:49,350","Whoa! His music
is too powerful!"
1096,"01:19:49,352","01:19:51,687","We're gonna need something
even more positive."
1097,"01:19:51,689","01:19:52,958","Now, Drac!"
1098,"01:20:07,404","01:20:10,072","- Really?
- It has a nice message."
1099,"01:20:19,816","01:20:22,584","I've had enough
of this nonsense!"
1100,"01:20:45,275","01:20:48,610","Johnny, we need
the most brain-dominating,"
1101,"01:20:48,612","01:20:52,380","toe-tappinating song in the
history of all the universe."
1102,"01:20:55,752","01:20:58,422","Come on.
Where is it?"
1103,"01:21:00,423","01:21:02,558",I don't know!
1104,"01:21:02,560","01:21:04,259",There's too many choices.
1105,"01:21:06,797","01:21:08,796","No, wait!"
1106,"01:21:08,798","01:21:11,636",This is it.
1107,"01:21:24,414","01:21:25,714",What the...
1108,"01:21:40,331","01:21:42,199","Boy, that stinks."
1109,"01:21:48,372","01:21:50,738",It's working!
1110,"01:21:57,515","01:22:02,518","Hey, Johnny's corny music
is defeating the evil music."
1111,"01:22:02,520","01:22:03,852",I kind of like it.
1112,"01:22:03,854","01:22:05,590",Ooh!
1113,"01:22:26,276","01:22:28,477",No!
1114,"01:22:48,298","01:22:50,631",Argh! Ahhh! Whoo!
1115,"01:22:50,633","01:22:53,671",I'm a slave to the rhythm!
1116,"01:22:59,877","01:23:01,146",No!
1117,"01:23:03,447","01:23:05,380","Drac, what are you doing?"
1118,"01:23:05,382","01:23:07,549","You got to be greater
than the haters!"
1119,"01:23:11,422","01:23:13,191",Huh?
1120,"01:23:23,333","01:23:24,366",Why?
1121,"01:23:24,368","01:23:27,268","Why, after everything,"
1122,"01:23:27,270","01:23:29,403",would you save my life?
1123,"01:23:29,405","01:23:32,840","Because basically
we are all the same."
1124,"01:23:32,842","01:23:36,445","Claws or hands, two eyes
or three eyes."
1125,"01:23:36,447","01:23:38,479","- Green skin.
- No skin."
1126,"01:23:38,481","01:23:39,880","- Prickly.
- Brainy."
1127,"01:23:45,556","01:23:46,858",I'm sorry.
1128,"01:23:53,730","01:23:55,731",Ew.
1129,"01:23:55,733","01:23:57,869",You are amazing.
1130,"01:24:08,545","01:24:11,349","Look at me, Dennis.
Look at me."
1131,"01:24:12,582","01:24:15,349","Come on,
you can't deny it."
1132,"01:24:15,351","01:24:17,421","No! I'm too young
to Zing!"
1133,"01:24:22,359","01:24:24,558","Well, I feel
kind of silly now."
1134,"01:24:24,560","01:24:28,397","Heh. For decades
I have hunted your kind,"
1135,"01:24:28,399","01:24:29,997",persecuted you.
1136,"01:24:33,037","01:24:36,240","The only thing I can do
to make it up to you is"
1137,"01:24:37,474","01:24:38,773",give you
1138,"01:24:40,043","01:24:42,044",a 30% refund.
1139,"01:24:42,046","01:24:44,548",Preposterous!
1140,"01:24:45,916","01:24:47,749","Oh, all right."
1141,"01:24:47,751","01:24:48,950",Full refund.
1142,"01:25:19,550","01:25:22,483","Wayne, Wanda,
what happened to you guys?"
1143,"01:25:22,485","01:25:25,086","Yeah, we, like,
hardly saw you on the cruise."
1144,"01:25:25,088","01:25:27,388","Yeah, I know."
1145,"01:25:27,390","01:25:29,357","We got tranquilized and spent most
of the trip locked in a closet."
1146,"01:25:29,359","01:25:32,063","We're gonna book it
again for the holidays."
1147,"01:25:38,068","01:25:39,567",Hi. Checking in?
1148,"01:25:39,569","01:25:41,603",Yes. Thank you.
1149,"01:25:41,605","01:25:44,485",Great. I have a room all ready for you.
1150,"01:25:45,408","01:25:47,576","Hey, buddy, would you mind?"
1151,"01:25:47,578","01:25:48,978","Sure thing, pal."
1152,"01:26:04,528","01:26:08,429","Okay, what's going on,
