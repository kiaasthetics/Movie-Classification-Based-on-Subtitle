2,"00:00:53,303","00:00:57,222","I know when you're alone
You feel it too"
3,"00:00:57,390","00:01:00,726",In your arms is where I long to be
4,"00:01:01,102","00:01:03,270",'Cause being with you gives me sanity

6,"00:01:07,317","00:01:09,109","Listen to me, darling"
7,"00:01:09,277","00:01:12,738","I wake up every morning
thinking about the way you feel"
8,"00:01:15,366","00:01:17,159",I wonder if you know it
9,"00:01:17,327","00:01:20,287","And what good is the party
If you're not around?"
10,"00:01:20,455","00:01:21,455",But listen to me now
11,"00:01:21,915","00:01:24,625",What good is love?

16,"00:01:36,137","00:01:37,346",Is it a crazy love?
17,"00:01:37,514","00:01:40,849","This is a crazy party
I'm so glad I'm here with everybody"
18,"00:01:41,017","00:01:42,851","Baby, move your body
Shake it to the ground"
19,"00:01:43,019","00:01:45,229","Break it, break it, break it down, Blu"
20,"00:01:45,522","00:01:46,814",Me?
21,"00:01:46,981","00:01:49,817",What's a song if you can't hear it too?
22,"00:01:51,528","00:01:55,030",Can't imagine dancing without you
23,"00:01:55,323","00:01:57,908","A shooting star
Ain't really nothing to see"
24,"00:01:59,410","00:02:03,372","If you're not right here
Standing next to me"
25,"00:02:05,542","00:02:07,209","Listen to me, darling"
26,"00:02:07,377","00:02:09,044",I wake up every morning

30,"00:02:18,555","00:02:20,013",Listen to me now
31,"00:02:20,181","00:02:22,224",What good is love?
32,"00:02:23,560","00:02:26,854",If it's not your love
33,"00:02:30,066","00:02:32,901","For a bird from Minnesota,
you've got some moves."
34,"00:02:33,069","00:02:34,903","That wasn't a move.
That was an accident."
35,"00:02:35,071","00:02:36,405",But I accept the compliment.
36,"00:02:36,614","00:02:38,949",It's great Rafael could watch the kids.
37,"00:02:39,117","00:02:42,077","Yeah, it looks like
you're stuck with me all night."
38,"00:02:42,245","00:02:43,912","You're my one and only, Blu."
39,"00:02:44,080","00:02:47,624","That's a good thing,
since I'm the only other one."
40,"00:02:47,792","00:02:50,252","Hey, you lovebirds! Happy New Year!"
41,"00:02:50,420","00:02:51,461",Rafi? Where are the...
42,"00:02:51,546","00:02:54,214",The kids are with Luiz. No worries!
43,"00:02:54,382","00:02:56,383",Worries. Right here.
44,"00:02:59,470","00:03:00,888",Luiz? Where are the kids?
45,"00:03:01,055","00:03:02,931",What? I don't have any kids.
46,"00:03:03,099","00:03:04,099",Our kids!
47,"00:03:04,225","00:03:06,435","Oh, right. I left them with Tiny."
48,"00:03:06,603","00:03:07,603",Tiny?
49,"00:03:07,604","00:03:10,522",What? She's an excellent babysitter.
50,"00:03:10,857","00:03:12,608",I'm a terrible babysitter!
51,"00:03:12,775","00:03:14,610",This is gonna be awesome!
52,"00:03:14,777","00:03:16,778","All right,
I've done all the calculations..."
53,"00:03:16,946","00:03:19,531","and each explosion
will be perfectly synced to the beat."
54,"00:03:19,699","00:03:22,242",Unless I didn't carry the one.
55,"00:03:22,410","00:03:23,410",Here's my vision.
56,"00:03:23,411","00:03:26,205","Red, blue, green, yellow, yellow!
Purple."
57,"00:03:26,372","00:03:30,209","Here's my vision.
Boom! Crash! Bang! Kapow!"
58,"00:03:30,376","00:03:32,794","I don't think your parents
would like this very much."
59,"00:03:33,379","00:03:35,047",Here we go.
60,"00:03:36,424","00:03:37,745","Where are you going, little bird?"
61,"00:03:37,800","00:03:39,384","- Hey, what is this?
- Oh, Dad."
62,"00:03:39,552","00:03:40,552","Guys, you know the rules."
63,"00:03:40,637","00:03:42,763","No pyrotechnics
without adult supervision."
64,"00:03:42,931","00:03:44,097",We asked Tiny.
65,"00:03:44,265","00:03:45,641","That's even worse.
Sorry, Tiny."
66,"00:03:45,808","00:03:47,976","You don't have to pay me, Senhor Blu."
67,"00:03:48,144","00:03:49,603","Kids, next time, ask me."
68,"00:03:49,771","00:03:51,313","But you always say ""no."""
69,"00:03:51,481","00:03:52,481","No, I don't."
70,"00:03:52,482","00:03:54,233","Dad, you're in denial."
71,"00:03:54,400","00:03:56,068","Honey, do I always say ""no""?"
72,"00:03:56,236","00:03:59,655","- Yes. I mean, no.
- Great."
73,"00:03:59,822","00:04:01,573","Now Mom's saying it, too."
74,"00:04:03,826","00:04:06,787","Listen, we are the last
blue Spix's Macaws left on the planet."
75,"00:04:06,955","00:04:09,623","We have to stay safe.
Birds of blue feathers..."
76,"00:04:09,791","00:04:12,918",Have to stick together.
77,"00:04:13,086","00:04:14,169",I smell chicken.
78,"00:04:16,923","00:04:20,008","No, no, no!"
79,"00:04:20,927","00:04:21,927","No, no, no!"
80,"00:04:22,303","00:04:25,639","By my calculations,
that's his twenty-seventh ""no"" today."
81,"00:04:30,687","00:04:31,687",Help!
82,"00:04:34,148","00:04:39,361","- Five, four, three, two, one!
- Everybody, fly!"
83,"00:04:39,529","00:04:40,988",Happy New Year!
84,"00:04:50,206","00:04:53,959","Oh, man.
How come Dad gets to have all the fun?"
85,"00:04:54,127","00:04:56,878",Look! It worked!
86,"00:04:57,046","00:05:00,799","Well, this year is off to a great start."
87,"00:05:20,319","00:05:23,447","Amazon Expedition, day seven."
88,"00:05:23,656","00:05:25,240",Two thousand miles from Rio...
89,"00:05:25,408","00:05:27,088","we've reached the center
of the rainforest."
90,"00:05:28,828","00:05:31,246","We are surrounded
by plants and animals..."
91,"00:05:31,414","00:05:33,665",struggling for survival...
92,"00:05:33,833","00:05:36,626",as we glide effortlessly down the river.
93,"00:05:36,794","00:05:39,004",Effortless for you.
94,"00:05:39,672","00:05:41,173",How pretty.
95,"00:05:41,966","00:05:43,842","Spit it out, spit it out!"
96,"00:05:45,386","00:05:48,722","We are near the nesting grounds
of the Amazonian Wood Quail."
97,"00:05:48,890","00:05:50,807",Odontophorus gujanensis.
98,"00:05:50,975","00:05:53,185","Six months ago,
we rescued this little bird..."
99,"00:05:53,352","00:05:54,770",from smugglers.
100,"00:05:54,937","00:05:56,772","It was sick, malnourished..."
101,"00:05:56,939","00:05:59,191","with a broken leg, but now..."
102,"00:05:59,358","00:06:00,776",my trusty assistant...
103,"00:06:02,487","00:06:06,239","I mean, loving wife and colleague,
will release her..."
104,"00:06:06,407","00:06:08,241",back to her natural habitat.
105,"00:06:08,409","00:06:09,409",It's okay.
106,"00:06:09,494","00:06:10,952",You can go now.
107,"00:06:11,120","00:06:12,829",Just like this.
108,"00:06:13,039","00:06:14,206",Let me talk to her.
109,"00:06:19,045","00:06:20,212",Go on.
110,"00:06:23,341","00:06:24,633",FREAKS!
111,"00:06:27,887","00:06:29,888",Do you think she's gonna be all right?
112,"00:06:30,056","00:06:31,765",Give it some time.
113,"00:06:40,900","00:06:42,609",Welcome home.
114,"00:06:47,323","00:06:50,033","Wait a minute.
What is she saying, Tulio?"
115,"00:06:50,618","00:06:52,786",It's just hard for her to say goodbye.
116,"00:06:53,579","00:06:54,579",No.
117,"00:06:54,831","00:06:56,373",I think she's trying to warn us.
118,"00:06:56,791","00:06:58,792","No, no, no, Linda."
119,"00:06:58,960","00:07:01,044",It might be some sort of mating dance.
120,"00:07:09,137","00:07:10,971",Tulio! Look!
121,"00:07:11,389","00:07:13,265",Paddle! Now!
122,"00:07:13,766","00:07:16,101","Okay, okay, okay. Paddle."
123,"00:07:17,186","00:07:18,311",Watch out!
124,"00:07:19,480","00:07:21,356","Paddle, paddle! Backward, backward!"
125,"00:07:21,524","00:07:23,900","To the right! No, left!
Forward, forward! No, no!"
126,"00:07:24,068","00:07:25,819","Make up your mind, Tulio!"
127,"00:07:28,364","00:07:29,948",Cheese and sprinkles!
128,"00:07:40,084","00:07:41,418","Oh, no!"
129,"00:07:43,337","00:07:44,880","Paddle, paddle! Faster!"
130,"00:07:45,631","00:07:48,341",Tulio!
131,"00:07:58,352","00:08:00,645",Linda! Linda!
132,"00:08:00,813","00:08:02,189",Tulio!
133,"00:08:07,987","00:08:10,614",Thank heavens you're okay.
134,"00:08:17,246","00:08:18,955","Tulio, is that a..."
135,"00:08:41,687","00:08:44,397",Linda! This is incredible!
136,"00:09:12,885","00:09:14,261","Good morning, Jewel!"
137,"00:09:23,771","00:09:26,564","Hey! Everyone, look what I found."
138,"00:09:26,732","00:09:27,816",Blu?
139,"00:09:28,651","00:09:29,901",Kids?
140,"00:09:30,069","00:09:31,069",Where did everybody...?
141,"00:09:31,070","00:09:34,406","Okay, who's ready for some breakfast?"
142,"00:09:34,573","00:09:35,907",Unbelievable.
143,"00:09:38,494","00:09:39,494",Did you know...
144,"00:09:39,662","00:09:42,080","that these whole wheat pancakes have
twice the vitamins and minerals..."
145,"00:09:42,248","00:09:43,248",of regular pancakes?
146,"00:09:43,416","00:09:46,668","And with the blueberries,
it's four times as tasty."
147,"00:09:48,838","00:09:50,672","Hey, where are the blueberries?"
148,"00:09:50,840","00:09:52,132","Oh, Dad!"
149,"00:09:52,300","00:09:53,758",Looking for this?
150,"00:09:54,176","00:09:55,176",Bring it.
151,"00:09:55,803","00:09:58,123","It's down to the final minutes.
He's got magic in his feet!"
152,"00:09:58,222","00:09:59,222",He shoots!
153,"00:09:59,223","00:10:00,849","- He scores! Goal!
- Goal!"
154,"00:10:01,684","00:10:03,393","Yeah, I got it. I'm good."
155,"00:10:03,561","00:10:05,478","Heads up, Dad!"
156,"00:10:08,024","00:10:09,316",No.
157,"00:10:16,824","00:10:18,199",Awesome.
158,"00:10:21,746","00:10:23,204","Hi, Mom."
159,"00:10:24,332","00:10:25,332",Busted.
160,"00:10:25,499","00:10:26,750",Time to go.
161,"00:10:27,585","00:10:29,210","Hey, honey. Hey. You hungry?"
162,"00:10:29,378","00:10:31,421","Blu, we talked about this."
163,"00:10:31,589","00:10:32,589",Did we? I don't...
164,"00:10:32,715","00:10:34,382","Yeah, so, what do you got there?"
165,"00:10:34,550","00:10:35,550",Breakfast.
166,"00:10:35,551","00:10:37,510","That's funny.
But seriously, what is that?"
167,"00:10:37,678","00:10:39,220",It's a Brazil nut.
168,"00:10:39,388","00:10:41,589","I never thought I would find one
this close to the city."
169,"00:10:41,599","00:10:42,891",I wanna show the kids how to open one.
170,"00:10:43,059","00:10:44,059",You mean like this?
171,"00:10:45,186","00:10:46,603",Dad already showed us.
172,"00:10:47,563","00:10:49,356","Wait. Wait, go back."
173,"00:10:49,523","00:10:50,565",Mom! Dad!
174,"00:10:50,733","00:10:51,733",You're on TV!
175,"00:10:51,901","00:10:53,860","Doctor Tulio Monteiro,
the Bird Man of Brazil..."
176,"00:10:54,028","00:10:56,237",announced an important discovery today.
177,"00:10:56,405","00:10:59,866","We believe we have encountered
a wild blue Spix's Macaw..."
178,"00:11:00,034","00:11:01,618",deep in the Amazon jungle.
179,"00:11:02,036","00:11:05,997","The blue Spix's Macaw
was thought to be practically extinct..."
180,"00:11:06,165","00:11:08,124","with the last remaining family
living under protection..."
181,"00:11:08,292","00:11:10,251","at the Blu Bird Sanctuary
in Rio de Janeiro."
182,"00:11:10,461","00:11:11,753",We're famous!
183,"00:11:11,921","00:11:15,465","If these birds can be found,
their home will be saved."
184,"00:11:15,633","00:11:17,634",There may be a whole flock out there.
185,"00:11:17,802","00:11:21,429","And if there is,
we will find them and protect them."
186,"00:11:21,597","00:11:22,680","Hi, Blu!"
187,"00:11:23,099","00:11:24,307","Hi, Linda!"
188,"00:11:24,767","00:11:26,476",We're not the only ones.
189,"00:11:27,812","00:11:29,104",There are more of us out there.
190,"00:11:29,271","00:11:30,605","Yeah, that's great. I'm sure they're..."
191,"00:11:30,773","00:11:32,941","All this time, I thought..."
192,"00:11:33,651","00:11:36,111",I thought we were alone.
193,"00:11:36,278","00:11:38,279","Hey, it hasn't been all bad."
194,"00:11:39,115","00:11:41,408",Of course not.
195,"00:11:41,575","00:11:43,785","But just imagine
if there was a whole flock of us."
196,"00:11:45,287","00:11:46,788",How amazing would that be?
197,"00:11:49,792","00:11:51,251","- We gotta do something.
- We do?"
198,"00:11:51,419","00:11:54,796","Yeah, we have to fly to the Amazon
and help Linda and Tulio find them!"
199,"00:11:54,964","00:11:57,465","Whoa, we can't just pack up and go."
200,"00:11:57,633","00:11:58,341",Why not?
201,"00:11:58,509","00:12:01,636","It's about time this family
got a little air under our wings."
202,"00:12:01,846","00:12:05,974","Look at us. iPods, TV. Pancakes?"
203,"00:12:06,142","00:12:09,686","We're not people, we're birds."
204,"00:12:09,854","00:12:12,313","We have to get out into the wild
and be birds, Blu."
205,"00:12:12,481","00:12:14,149",Let the kids connect to their roots.
206,"00:12:14,316","00:12:15,859",Show them what I had.
207,"00:12:16,026","00:12:18,027",They need this. We need this.
208,"00:12:18,195","00:12:19,988","Come on, Blu, what do you say?"
209,"00:12:20,614","00:12:21,990",I don't know.
210,"00:12:22,158","00:12:23,158",Maybe.
211,"00:12:23,325","00:12:24,367","He didn't say ""no."""
212,"00:12:24,535","00:12:26,369","Which means he practically said ""yes."""
213,"00:12:26,537","00:12:28,497","- Hey, wait a sec-...
- It's gonna be so much fun!"
214,"00:12:28,539","00:12:30,039",Yeah!
215,"00:12:30,207","00:12:32,333",We're going to the Amazon!
216,"00:12:32,501","00:12:35,128",Wait. What's the Amazon?
217,"00:12:35,296","00:12:38,506","The Amazon is one of Earth's
most endangered ecosystems..."
218,"00:12:38,674","00:12:40,633",due to illegal logging and farming.
219,"00:12:40,801","00:12:42,802","Let's hope Doctor Monteiro
and his team..."
220,"00:12:42,970","00:12:46,556","can find these rare birds
so their home can be saved."
221,"00:12:46,724","00:12:48,850",There may be a whole flock out there.
222,"00:12:49,018","00:12:52,520","And if there is,
we will find them and protect them."
223,"00:12:53,272","00:12:54,856",Tree huggers.
224,"00:12:55,024","00:12:56,691",Get my boat ready.
225,"00:12:56,859","00:13:00,028",I need to deal with this personally.
226,"00:13:06,804","00:13:07,804",Next!
227,"00:13:07,828","00:13:10,371","That would be me.
Okay, everybody can go home now."
228,"00:13:10,539","00:13:14,042","You're looking at the next
King of Carnival!"
229,"00:13:17,046","00:13:19,380","Hey, big bird! Break a leg!"
230,"00:13:22,218","00:13:24,135","Walk it off, buddy!"
231,"00:13:24,303","00:13:27,180",You can't see it coming
232,"00:13:27,348","00:13:32,894",You won't find it anywhere else
233,"00:13:39,902","00:13:41,569",That was amazing!
234,"00:13:41,737","00:13:45,907","Eva, darling, you hit every note.
Huh, guys?"
235,"00:13:46,075","00:13:49,410","Yeah, along with a bunch of notes
I never heard of."
236,"00:13:49,578","00:13:50,578",Rafi!
237,"00:13:50,746","00:13:52,914",Don't worry. I'll talk to them.
238,"00:13:53,082","00:13:55,250",We'll find the perfect spot for you.
239,"00:13:55,584","00:13:56,751","Antarctica, maybe."
240,"00:13:56,919","00:13:58,086",You better.
241,"00:13:59,421","00:14:00,672","Bye, boys."
242,"00:14:00,839","00:14:03,716","See you back at home, my tasty mango!"
243,"00:14:04,510","00:14:07,762","None of these acts are inspiring.
I'm just not inspired."
244,"00:14:07,930","00:14:10,974","Carnival is right around the corner,
and our reputations are on the line."
245,"00:14:11,141","00:14:11,891",Copy that.
246,"00:14:12,059","00:14:14,727","We need something that can make us wiggle.
Something that make us jiggle."
247,"00:14:14,895","00:14:16,229",We need something that pops.
248,"00:14:17,690","00:14:19,649","You know what ""pop"" is backwards?
Pop."
249,"00:14:19,817","00:14:20,984",Next.
250,"00:14:22,778","00:14:23,778",Blu?
251,"00:14:23,862","00:14:24,862","Sorry, bro!"
252,"00:14:24,863","00:14:28,324","It's okay, Luiz. Good to see you, too."
253,"00:14:28,993","00:14:30,702","Listen, Blu,
we are looking for a singer..."
254,"00:14:30,869","00:14:32,328","a dancer, the whole package."
255,"00:14:32,496","00:14:34,664","Yeah, and you're more of
a mumbler-shuffler."
256,"00:14:34,832","00:14:36,124",You catch my drift?
257,"00:14:36,292","00:14:39,627","No, I'm not here to audition.
I've got news."
258,"00:14:39,795","00:14:42,714",I am going to the Amazon.
259,"00:14:42,881","00:14:44,299",Yay.
260,"00:14:45,050","00:14:48,219","The Amazon? Wow, that's wild."
261,"00:14:48,387","00:14:51,014","Yeah, Jewel thinks it'll be good for us."
262,"00:14:51,181","00:14:52,181",How wild?
263,"00:14:52,349","00:14:53,558",Real wild.
264,"00:14:53,726","00:14:56,519","They got mosquitoes
that suck your blood like Slurpees."
265,"00:14:56,687","00:14:59,063",Snakes that can swallow you whole.
266,"00:14:59,231","00:15:03,693",Flesh-eating piranhas that eat flesh.
267,"00:15:04,612","00:15:06,413","Great, that sounds really nice.
I'm not going."
268,"00:15:06,572","00:15:07,572","Guys, guys, guys."
269,"00:15:07,698","00:15:09,699","Blu, you have nothing to worry about."
270,"00:15:09,867","00:15:11,993","All those stories
are highly exaggerated."
271,"00:15:12,161","00:15:13,786","- You think so?
- Of course!"
272,"00:15:13,954","00:15:16,456","If this is important to Jewel,
just do it."
273,"00:15:16,624","00:15:19,834","Happy wife, happy life. Remember that."
274,"00:15:20,002","00:15:21,961","Okay, yeah, you're right."
275,"00:15:22,171","00:15:24,756","A little family vacation
might actually be fun."
276,"00:15:24,923","00:15:26,382","Plus, it's not like it's forever."
277,"00:15:26,550","00:15:27,634",That's the spirit.
278,"00:15:27,801","00:15:29,552",Yeah. Okay.
279,"00:15:29,720","00:15:31,012","Thanks, guys."
280,"00:15:31,430","00:15:33,181",See you in a couple of weeks!
281,"00:15:33,349","00:15:34,766","Safe travels, Blu!"
282,"00:15:34,933","00:15:36,351",Bring me back a souvenir!
283,"00:15:36,518","00:15:41,230","Dawg, he ain't coming back. He is dead."

285,"00:15:44,234","00:15:46,152","Let's go! Come on, Dad! Come on!"
286,"00:15:46,320","00:15:50,615","Okay. Bug spray, check.
Water purifier, check. Band-Aids."
287,"00:15:50,783","00:15:52,825","- I feel like I'm forgetting something.
- Cool!"
288,"00:15:52,993","00:15:55,745",The all-in-one adventurer's knife!
289,"00:15:55,913","00:15:57,664",I'll be in charge of this.

292,"00:16:00,167","00:16:02,919","Did you know the Amazon has snakes
that can swallow you whole?"
293,"00:16:03,087","00:16:06,255","Actually, Bia,
all those stories are highly exaggerated."
294,"00:16:06,423","00:16:07,715","No, really. Look."
295,"00:16:11,345","00:16:12,595",That's sick!
296,"00:16:12,763","00:16:15,056","All right, are we ready to go?"
297,"00:16:15,224","00:16:16,432","- A fanny pack?
- Yeah."
298,"00:16:16,600","00:16:18,768","Linda gave it to me.
I need it for the GPS."
299,"00:16:18,936","00:16:20,103",Where's the GPS?
300,"00:16:20,187","00:16:22,063","- Hey!
- Carla, we're leaving."
301,"00:16:22,314","00:16:25,191",I'm not going. It's gonna be lame.
302,"00:16:25,651","00:16:27,110","Okay, here it is."
303,"00:16:27,277","00:16:30,446","The voice recognition makes it
totally foolproof. Here, watch this."

312,"00:16:47,214","00:16:49,757","Sure. I promised her a spot
in the Carnival show."

- You guys are late."
314,"00:16:51,969","00:16:54,762","- Clock-late.
- But musician-early."

390,"00:23:01,755","00:23:04,381","I would do anything for you.
You know that, right?"
391,"00:23:04,549","00:23:06,634",Of course I do.
392,"00:23:21,900","00:23:25,736","We aren't here to snack.
We are here to avenge."
393,"00:23:25,904","00:23:28,572","Once these pesky passengers
fall asleep..."
394,"00:23:28,740","00:23:32,326","we'll show our blue friends some love.
Some..."
395,"00:23:32,661","00:23:35,079",poisonous love.
396,"00:23:35,247","00:23:37,331",That's my specialty.
397,"00:23:37,499","00:23:39,834",We attack at the midnight hour...
398,"00:23:40,001","00:23:42,169",because it's more evil.
399,"00:23:42,337","00:23:44,171",Stay alert.
400,"00:23:49,845","00:23:52,763",Midnight! Time to attack.
401,"00:23:53,473","00:23:56,016",Nigel! Nigel?
402,"00:23:58,520","00:24:01,438",Look at us. Misfits.
403,"00:24:02,190","00:24:06,443","A toxic frog, and a flightless freak."
404,"00:24:06,695","00:24:10,990","So different, and yet, the same."
405,"00:24:11,324","00:24:13,159","My darling, while you sleep
All is well"
406,"00:24:13,326","00:24:17,496","We are friends, and that's swell But the
truth is that I have a secret to tell"
407,"00:24:17,664","00:24:21,458",I love you
408,"00:24:24,171","00:24:25,671","People say it's wrong
It's absurd"
409,"00:24:25,839","00:24:28,674","That a frog and a bird are in love
But I know in my heart"
410,"00:24:28,842","00:24:33,220",This was so meant to be
411,"00:24:34,014","00:24:36,974","If only we could hug and could kiss
It'd be heavenly bliss"
412,"00:24:37,142","00:24:39,383","But your lungs would explode
And you'd lookjust like this"
413,"00:24:39,519","00:24:42,188","And you'd gag
With your face turning blue"
414,"00:24:42,355","00:24:43,689",Eww
415,"00:24:44,024","00:24:46,901","But, darling, I'll protect you
I will, don't worry, just chill"
416,"00:24:47,068","00:24:49,862","'Cause there isn't a bird
That I wouldn't kill"
417,"00:24:50,030","00:24:54,992",For you Can't you see
418,"00:24:56,411","00:24:59,079",We were destined to be?
419,"00:24:59,247","00:25:03,751","- For we have love
- Love"
420,"00:25:03,919","00:25:07,213","- Poisonous love
- Love"
421,"00:25:07,380","00:25:11,050","And although, yes"
422,"00:25:11,259","00:25:16,555",I know that you can't hold me
423,"00:25:16,723","00:25:18,682",Feel me close now.
424,"00:25:18,850","00:25:23,771",Your loving wings enfold me
425,"00:25:24,397","00:25:27,024",Fate told me
426,"00:25:27,192","00:25:28,776",Love
427,"00:25:28,944","00:25:31,278","- Poisonous love
- Love"
428,"00:25:32,155","00:25:34,782",Standing here
429,"00:25:34,950","00:25:38,410",You're so near And yet
430,"00:25:39,412","00:25:40,996",So far
431,"00:25:41,248","00:25:42,748",Like a star.
432,"00:25:42,916","00:25:44,917",Here we are
433,"00:25:45,085","00:25:46,794",Where?
434,"00:25:46,962","00:25:49,505",What to do?
435,"00:25:49,673","00:25:52,258",To do
436,"00:25:52,634","00:25:54,468","Oh, pooh."
437,"00:25:55,512","00:25:59,306",You're my Romeo I'm Juliet
438,"00:25:59,474","00:26:01,642","We're so perfect, and yet"
439,"00:26:01,810","00:26:03,978","If we touch, not by much"
440,"00:26:04,145","00:26:06,146",Still on all you can bet
441,"00:26:06,314","00:26:09,149",It's goodbye
442,"00:26:09,317","00:26:12,987",And I'll cry
443,"00:26:13,947","00:26:18,867",As you die
444,"00:26:19,160","00:26:24,999",From our poisonous love
445,"00:26:38,680","00:26:40,514",What a nightmare.
446,"00:26:41,474","00:26:42,474",Charlie!
447,"00:26:42,642","00:26:45,185",You were supposed to wake me!
448,"00:26:45,520","00:26:47,521",It's time.
449,"00:26:55,864","00:26:58,407",I love being on Team Nigel!
450,"00:28:03,264","00:28:08,477","I can't think of anything more romantic than
poisoning passengers on a moonlight cruise."
451,"00:28:08,645","00:28:09,645",Stop.
452,"00:28:10,897","00:28:13,065",That one is mine.
453,"00:28:13,233","00:28:15,442","Twinkle, twinkle little Blu."
454,"00:28:15,610","00:28:18,112","How I wondered, where were you?"
455,"00:28:18,279","00:28:21,156",Up above the world so high...
456,"00:28:21,324","00:28:23,283",are you ready...
457,"00:28:23,451","00:28:25,577",to die?
458,"00:28:25,745","00:28:27,413",You need a breath mint.
459,"00:28:27,580","00:28:30,332","Even in sleep, you mock me."
460,"00:28:46,808","00:28:48,434",Wait for me!
461,"00:28:49,269","00:28:51,103",Don't leave me!
462,"00:28:51,855","00:28:53,647",Tiago! Stop fooling around.
463,"00:28:53,815","00:28:55,274",I didn't do anything.
464,"00:28:55,442","00:28:57,192","Tiago Gunderson, listen to your mother."
465,"00:28:57,360","00:28:59,319",Man.
466,"00:29:00,321","00:29:02,156","We're almost there, right?"
467,"00:29:02,323","00:29:03,866","- Hey, guys. Wait up.
- Come on, Blu."
468,"00:29:04,033","00:29:05,534","Remember, birds of a..."
469,"00:29:06,202","00:29:07,828",Nevermind.
470,"00:29:11,499","00:29:12,875",They're getting away!
471,"00:29:13,168","00:29:16,336","Wake up, you insect-eating idiot.
Follow them."
472,"00:29:18,506","00:29:21,175",Better. Now go ten times faster.
473,"00:29:23,303","00:29:25,012",River hogs!
474,"00:30:04,761","00:30:05,761",You!
475,"00:30:05,887","00:30:09,223","I always suspected
you were dumber than a monkey."
476,"00:30:09,390","00:30:10,933","And now, I know."
477,"00:30:11,726","00:30:14,269",Boss! What are you doing in the jungle?
478,"00:30:14,437","00:30:16,230",Perhaps the better question is...
479,"00:30:16,606","00:30:17,981",what are they doing?
480,"00:30:18,733","00:30:20,484",Nature freaks.
481,"00:30:23,112","00:30:25,489",Two million square miles of jungle...
482,"00:30:25,740","00:30:28,909",and they're playing in my backyard?
483,"00:30:30,078","00:30:31,954",I don't think so.
484,"00:30:32,121","00:30:35,958","As you know, my friends,
this logging operation is a little..."
485,"00:30:36,751","00:30:37,918",illegal.
486,"00:30:38,086","00:30:41,755","If those two nuts find those birds,
we're out of business."
487,"00:30:41,923","00:30:42,923",And that's why you...
488,"00:30:43,341","00:30:47,135","must put an end to their
little bird-watching expedition."
489,"00:30:47,303","00:30:50,681",Find them and get rid of them.
490,"00:30:50,848","00:30:53,850","The rest of you, go cut some trees."
491,"00:30:56,104","00:30:58,981",Who cares about a bunch of birds?
492,"00:30:59,857","00:31:03,026","The macaws should
be nesting near the Brazil nut trees."
493,"00:31:03,194","00:31:05,279","So, I think
that we should continue with go..."
494,"00:31:06,030","00:31:09,157",Tulio! Are you listening to me?
495,"00:31:09,534","00:31:11,535",You have reached your destination.
496,"00:31:11,703","00:31:14,871","You see? It works like a charm.
Here we are."
497,"00:31:16,541","00:31:17,624",Where?
498,"00:31:17,959","00:31:19,626",These things have a margin of error.
499,"00:31:19,794","00:31:22,129",I told you not to trust that woman.
500,"00:31:23,047","00:31:26,800","That's a Heliconious larva.
It's about to enter the pupa stage."
501,"00:31:26,968","00:31:28,635","You said ""poop!"""
502,"00:31:28,803","00:31:30,721","Hey, kids. Stay close."
503,"00:31:31,139","00:31:32,139",I'll get them.
504,"00:31:32,307","00:31:35,642","Okay, you guys stay put.
I'll look around."
505,"00:31:35,810","00:31:39,313","No worries. We'll be here.
We're not going anywhere."
506,"00:31:39,480","00:31:41,481","My feathers is popping up
on the back of my neck."
507,"00:31:41,649","00:31:42,983",I don't like this.
508,"00:31:43,484","00:31:44,818",Let's back it up.
509,"00:31:47,822","00:31:49,990",Bia? Tiago?
510,"00:31:53,745","00:31:54,911","Come on, lady."
511,"00:31:55,830","00:31:58,749","- Don't let me down.
- Calculating route to ""Funky Town."""
512,"00:31:58,916","00:31:59,916","Oh, great."
513,"00:32:07,175","00:32:08,675","Okay, guys!"
514,"00:32:10,553","00:32:12,220",Guys?
515,"00:32:14,724","00:32:17,017","Good one, guys. Very funny."
516,"00:32:17,185","00:32:19,061","Good, good. Very witty."
517,"00:32:19,771","00:32:21,897","Jewel, where are you?"
518,"00:32:22,357","00:32:24,941",Kids? Jewel?
519,"00:32:27,570","00:32:28,695",It's a Macaw!
520,"00:32:28,863","00:32:30,030",Linda!
521,"00:32:30,198","00:32:31,365",Let me go!
522,"00:32:33,951","00:32:35,369","Let me go, you heathens!"
523,"00:32:35,870","00:32:36,870",Blu?
524,"00:32:41,417","00:32:43,710",I swear that sounded like Blu.
525,"00:32:43,878","00:32:45,379","That's impossible, Linda."
526,"00:32:45,546","00:32:48,215","He's back home in Rio, safe and sound."
527,"00:32:48,383","00:32:50,092","I am an American citizen, you savage!"
528,"00:32:50,259","00:32:51,760",I demand to see my ambassador!
529,"00:32:51,928","00:32:53,720",I know my rights! I know my rights!
530,"00:32:56,224","00:32:58,225","Back. Back, you barbarian!"
531,"00:32:58,893","00:32:59,893","Yeah, that's right."
532,"00:33:00,269","00:33:02,104",It's a spoon and a fork.
533,"00:33:02,271","00:33:04,731",Be afraid! Be very afraid.
534,"00:33:04,899","00:33:08,652","Whoa! Whoa, buddy. Put the spork down."
535,"00:33:08,903","00:33:09,945","- Let me go!
- Bring it!"
536,"00:33:10,113","00:33:12,072",Come on! You lucky I ain't big.
537,"00:33:41,018","00:33:43,520",I can't believe we found them!
538,"00:33:43,688","00:33:46,231","Technically, they found us."
539,"00:33:46,733","00:33:48,859","Okay, we're gonna need some nametags."
540,"00:33:49,026","00:33:51,486",Hello. Okay.
541,"00:33:51,696","00:33:53,989","No, those are breath mints.
Not that you need one."
542,"00:33:54,157","00:33:56,199",But they're good. You eat them.
543,"00:33:57,076","00:33:58,869","No, no, no! Not the whole box."
544,"00:33:59,036","00:34:00,746",Get that out of your mouth!
545,"00:34:04,167","00:34:07,043","What is this doing here?
What's going on?"
546,"00:34:07,211","00:34:09,129","We found them flying too close
to the humans."
547,"00:34:09,297","00:34:11,047","- What? And who are you?
- Uh..."
548,"00:34:11,215","00:34:12,966","""Uh"" is not an appropriate answer."
549,"00:34:13,134","00:34:15,302","I asked you a question.
Where did you come from?"
550,"00:34:15,470","00:34:16,470",Hey! Back off!
551,"00:34:16,596","00:34:18,597","Hey, excuse me, young lady."
552,"00:34:20,892","00:34:23,059",I can't believe it.
553,"00:34:23,936","00:34:25,604",How is this...?
554,"00:34:25,772","00:34:27,564",When the loggers came...
555,"00:34:27,732","00:34:32,027","there was fire, and so much smoke."
556,"00:34:32,236","00:34:35,322","I had you under my wing,
and then you were..."
557,"00:34:35,490","00:34:36,281",Gone.
558,"00:34:36,449","00:34:38,241",I've looked everywhere for you.
559,"00:34:38,409","00:34:40,452",I'm here.
560,"00:34:40,620","00:34:42,037",Daddy!
561,"00:34:43,206","00:34:44,539","""Daddy""?"
562,"00:34:47,126","00:34:49,085",I missed you.
563,"00:34:50,338","00:34:52,589","It's okay. It's okay, now."
564,"00:34:52,757","00:34:55,133",Daddy has you.
565,"00:34:57,887","00:34:59,346",Look at you.
566,"00:34:59,514","00:35:03,016","It's my little girl, all grown up."
567,"00:35:03,976","00:35:05,560",You're so beautiful.
568,"00:35:06,979","00:35:08,897",Just like your mother.
569,"00:35:11,317","00:35:13,068",I'm so sorry I lost you.
570,"00:35:13,694","00:35:17,197","I can't imagine you alone,
all this time."
571,"00:35:17,365","00:35:20,992","No, it's okay, Dad. I wasn't alone."
572,"00:35:22,078","00:35:23,286",Blu found me.
573,"00:35:26,833","00:35:28,959","Sure is nice to meet you, sir."
574,"00:35:30,503","00:35:32,254","Tuck that wing away, Stu."
575,"00:35:32,880","00:35:35,006","- Now, come here.
- Right, sure. Okay."
576,"00:35:35,341","00:35:36,925","- Closer.
- Really?"
577,"00:35:37,093","00:35:38,218",Closer.
578,"00:35:39,011","00:35:42,472","You brought my Jewel back to me.
I thank you."
579,"00:35:43,099","00:35:45,809","- I'm gonna hug you now.
- Okay."
580,"00:35:47,353","00:35:49,563","- Now, come here, you.
- Okay. There we are."
581,"00:35:49,730","00:35:50,814",My pleasure.
582,"00:35:50,982","00:35:52,649",Nico. You crying?
583,"00:35:52,817","00:35:55,277","It's a heavy moment,
and I'm very vulnerable right now."
584,"00:35:55,444","00:35:57,279",Come here. Let me get you a hug.
585,"00:36:02,159","00:36:03,952","Mom, are you okay?"
586,"00:36:04,120","00:36:05,203","""Mom""?"
587,"00:36:05,371","00:36:08,331",I'm a grandpa? I'm a grandpa.
588,"00:36:08,499","00:36:10,000","Look at me, I'm a grandpa!"
589,"00:36:10,167","00:36:13,253","Daddy, this is Carla, Bia and Tiago."
590,"00:36:13,421","00:36:14,629","Nice to meet you, sir."
591,"00:36:14,797","00:36:16,798","There is no ""sir"" around here,
young lady."
592,"00:36:16,966","00:36:19,134","- You will call me ""Pop-Pop!""
- Pop-Pop."
593,"00:36:19,302","00:36:21,636",I like that. It's got a nice ring to it.
594,"00:36:21,804","00:36:25,015","I am a Pop-Pop!
Yeah, I'm the Pop-Pop-Pop."
595,"00:36:25,182","00:36:28,268","Kids, go easy on old Pop-Pop."
596,"00:36:28,436","00:36:29,936","You can call me ""sir."""
597,"00:36:30,771","00:36:33,315",My daughter has returned!
598,"00:36:38,696","00:36:40,572","For years, we have been on the run..."
599,"00:36:40,740","00:36:42,782","as the humans push us
deeper into the jungle."
600,"00:36:42,950","00:36:46,119","But as you can see,
we have found sanctuary."
601,"00:36:46,287","00:36:49,039",A place we can finally put down roots.
602,"00:36:49,206","00:36:53,293","Everyone! Come on!
Everyone, out of your nests!"
603,"00:36:55,212","00:36:57,464",My daughter is home!
604,"00:36:57,632","00:37:00,926","Come on, birds. My Jewel is back!"
605,"00:37:03,846","00:37:05,430",Jewel?
606,"00:37:05,973","00:37:08,600",Make way. Make way! Jewel!
607,"00:37:08,768","00:37:10,101",Aunt Mimi? Aunt Mimi!
608,"00:37:12,980","00:37:14,481",I missed you so much!
609,"00:37:14,649","00:37:17,567",My little wildflower has returned!
610,"00:37:17,860","00:37:21,863","I knew you were coming back.
I saw it in the droppings."
611,"00:37:22,823","00:37:24,616",And look at the little ones!
612,"00:37:26,577","00:37:29,579","Aren't you the fluffiest,
most delicious little macaws?"
613,"00:37:30,498","00:37:32,832","- You're big for your age.
- Mimi..."
614,"00:37:33,000","00:37:34,000",this is Sue.
615,"00:37:34,085","00:37:37,087","- Actually, I'm Blu.
- Aren't we all?"
616,"00:37:37,254","00:37:38,838","No, really, that's my name."
617,"00:37:39,090","00:37:40,757","That's why they call us ""Blue Macaws."""
618,"00:37:41,092","00:37:42,092",Just go with it.
619,"00:37:48,683","00:37:51,351","So, that's what a Blue Macaw
is supposed to look like?"
620,"00:37:56,440","00:37:58,858",Look at her shining
621,"00:37:59,026","00:38:01,444","Her feathers, they glow"
622,"00:38:01,612","00:38:04,364",Now the jungle is smiling
623,"00:38:04,532","00:38:06,282",'Cause our baby's home
624,"00:38:06,450","00:38:09,244",Can you feel what I feel?

626,"00:38:11,580","00:38:14,207",Our precious Jewel has returned
627,"00:38:14,375","00:38:18,878","I'll be the first to sing
Welcome back"
628,"00:38:20,047","00:38:21,715",Roberto. I...
629,"00:38:22,258","00:38:24,384",Welcome back
630,"00:38:26,137","00:38:30,140","I said welcome, welcome, welcome"
631,"00:38:34,061","00:38:37,897",back
632,"00:38:38,941","00:38:40,108","Wow, you look great!"
633,"00:38:40,276","00:38:42,068",So do you.
634,"00:38:42,236","00:38:45,989","Hi, hey. Hi, there.
I am Jewel's significant other."
635,"00:38:46,907","00:38:50,243","So, you're the lucky bird
who swept Ju-Ju off her feet."
636,"00:38:50,453","00:38:52,078","- ""Ju-Ju""?
- Yeah."
637,"00:38:52,246","00:38:54,789","When we were kids, we always had
the cutest nicknames for each other."
638,"00:38:54,957","00:38:57,250","We did. I called him ""Beto."""
639,"00:38:57,418","00:38:59,294","That's adorable.
I love doing the nicknames."
640,"00:38:59,462","00:39:01,296","You never mentioned any ""Roberto."""
641,"00:39:01,464","00:39:02,672",There's nothing to mention.
642,"00:39:02,840","00:39:03,923",Hey.
643,"00:39:04,091","00:39:05,258",There's my wingman!
644,"00:39:05,426","00:39:07,385","We can rest easy
with Roberto on the lookout."
645,"00:39:07,553","00:39:10,430","Eduardo taught me everything I know.
He's the bird."
646,"00:39:10,598","00:39:12,223",No. You're the bird.
647,"00:39:12,391","00:39:14,059","- No, you're the bird.
- You're the bird!"
648,"00:39:14,226","00:39:16,061","We get it. You're both ""the bird."""
649,"00:39:16,228","00:39:18,730","Now, can we stop yakking
and start partying?"
650,"00:39:20,900","00:39:22,942",Wow! I remember this song.
651,"00:39:23,152","00:39:25,779","How could you forget?
It's in our blood, baby."
652,"00:39:25,946","00:39:28,448",It's who we are.
653,"00:39:28,616","00:39:30,283","You don't mind
if I borrow her for a minute, do you?"
654,"00:39:30,451","00:39:31,993","- Actually...
- Come on, Ju-Ju!"
655,"00:39:32,161","00:39:34,287",Let's go!
656,"00:39:34,580","00:39:38,792","Let's come together
Singing love and harmonia"
657,"00:39:41,462","00:39:43,254",We are so different
658,"00:39:43,422","00:39:46,841",But the same inside our hearts
659,"00:39:48,844","00:39:49,928",Blue-tiful colors
660,"00:39:50,304","00:39:52,514",As far as the eye can see
661,"00:39:55,518","00:39:56,684",Open your wings
662,"00:39:56,852","00:40:01,022",Fly when you hear the call

Dance and sing songs about freedom"
665,"00:40:11,117","00:40:12,659","Like la-la-la, ooh-ooh"
666,"00:40:12,827","00:40:14,661","- One for the jungle família
- Come on, Blu!"
667,"00:40:15,830","00:40:17,622","Like ba-ba-ba, boom-boom"
668,"00:40:17,790","00:40:22,127","- Calling all beautiful creatures

670,"00:40:26,882","00:40:29,509",Laugh and dance all the way
671,"00:40:31,637","00:40:36,015","Yo, this is untapped territory.
I'm loving this sound."
672,"00:40:49,947","00:40:51,990",Pop-Pop! I am a Pop-Pop!
673,"00:40:53,200","00:40:56,161","I am your Pop-Pop!
Yeah, I am the Pop-Pop"

what it feels like to be all alone."
682,"00:41:35,868","00:41:37,577",Misunderstood.
683,"00:41:37,745","00:41:40,163",You're the evil to my lethal.
684,"00:41:40,331","00:41:42,582","I can see why they call you ""Gabi."""
685,"00:41:42,750","00:41:45,752","Where are you, you filthy fowl?"
686,"00:41:47,838","00:41:48,838",Halt!
687,"00:41:55,012","00:41:56,888",I've been going about this all wrong.
688,"00:41:57,056","00:41:59,599",I need to search from higher ground.
689,"00:42:03,520","00:42:06,522","You stayed airborne
for almost a full second that time."
690,"00:42:09,610","00:42:12,445","What are you looking at?
Get me up there."
691,"00:42:13,614","00:42:14,948",Higher.
692,"00:42:15,199","00:42:17,617",Higher! Even higher.
693,"00:42:18,452","00:42:20,036",Little bit higher.
694,"00:42:21,372","00:42:22,956","Lower. Lower, now."
695,"00:42:23,707","00:42:26,876",Yes. Perfect.
696,"00:42:29,421","00:42:32,090",It's an infestation.
697,"00:42:33,550","00:42:37,929","Keep celebrating.
I'll be pooping on your party promptly."
698,"00:42:41,892","00:42:44,394","Hi, Nico! Hi, Pedro!"
699,"00:42:46,105","00:42:47,313",We came to the right place.
700,"00:42:47,481","00:42:49,649","This is popping.
It's popping in the Amazon."
701,"00:42:49,817","00:42:51,526","We could bring these macaws
back to Rio..."
702,"00:42:51,694","00:42:54,529",and have the best Carnival show ever.
703,"00:42:54,697","00:42:57,490",I am inspired!
704,"00:42:59,493","00:43:01,828","Sorry to break it to you, city boys..."
705,"00:43:01,996","00:43:03,663","but you'll have to find
some other talent."
706,"00:43:03,831","00:43:05,665",Nobody leaves the tribe.
707,"00:43:07,126","00:43:10,169","And no human things in the jungle.
Understood?"
708,"00:43:11,297","00:43:13,298",What? What's his problem?
709,"00:43:13,465","00:43:15,008",I feel naked.
710,"00:43:16,677","00:43:18,469",We could have been legends.
711,"00:43:18,637","00:43:21,055","We already are super-mega-dope, but..."
712,"00:43:21,223","00:43:22,307",You know what I'm saying?
713,"00:43:22,683","00:43:24,892","We had it all.
The undiscovered talent..."
714,"00:43:25,060","00:43:26,978","the big idea, the inspiration."
715,"00:43:27,062","00:43:29,689","But if we can't bring
these guys to Rio..."
716,"00:43:29,857","00:43:30,857",we got nothing.
717,"00:43:30,983","00:43:31,983",Nothing?
718,"00:43:32,860","00:43:35,903",Hold your mangoes. We still have Eva.
719,"00:43:37,656","00:43:38,740",What?
720,"00:43:43,162","00:43:46,039","Wow! You still got the moves, Ju-Ju."
721,"00:43:46,373","00:43:47,707","- I'm so exhausted.
- Yeah."
722,"00:43:47,875","00:43:51,169","We should get some rest.
Find a local inn, or B and B nearby."
723,"00:43:51,337","00:43:52,545",What is this crazy talk?
724,"00:43:52,713","00:43:54,714","No, you guys are staying in my nest."
725,"00:43:54,882","00:43:56,215",I'm on patrol tonight.
726,"00:43:56,383","00:43:58,176",Mi casa es su casa.
727,"00:43:58,344","00:43:59,719","That's really nice, Beto."
728,"00:43:59,887","00:44:01,220","Thank you, but we're fine."
729,"00:44:01,388","00:44:04,891","Besides, our whole family
couldn't possibly fit in your bachelor pad."
730,"00:44:05,267","00:44:06,559",Whoa.
731,"00:44:07,686","00:44:09,479","Real estate must be pretty cheap
around here."
732,"00:44:09,646","00:44:11,939",Wow. This is incredible.
733,"00:44:12,733","00:44:16,277","This old nest? It's just something
I put together last minute."
734,"00:44:16,445","00:44:18,738","With my own two wings, of course."
735,"00:44:18,906","00:44:20,448",And my strength.
736,"00:44:20,616","00:44:22,075",And my brawn.
737,"00:44:23,827","00:44:26,496","Dad, it's huge! It has six bedrooms!"
738,"00:44:26,789","00:44:29,415","- I get the big one!
- No! I'm the oldest."
739,"00:44:29,583","00:44:32,085","Only by 3 minutes, 2.5 seconds."
740,"00:44:32,920","00:44:34,360",I had hoped to one day be blessed...
741,"00:44:34,463","00:44:36,631","with a flock of little Robertos
to call my own."
742,"00:44:36,799","00:44:38,674","- I bet you did.
- No way!"
743,"00:44:38,842","00:44:40,510",A bird bath!
744,"00:44:41,470","00:44:42,470","Tiago, caref-..."
745,"00:44:45,641","00:44:47,433",Jacuzzi.
746,"00:44:49,686","00:44:51,854","Blu, let me tell you something."
747,"00:44:52,022","00:44:56,609","If anything, and I mean anything,
ever happens to you..."
748,"00:44:56,777","00:44:58,694",I will take care of your family.
749,"00:44:59,321","00:45:01,114","All right, buddy. Sleep well."
750,"00:45:01,281","00:45:03,950","- Good night, Ju-Ju.
- Good night."
751,"00:45:18,132","00:45:19,757",Okay. All clear.
752,"00:45:20,092","00:45:21,676",Moon beams and starlight
753,"00:45:23,512","00:45:26,389",Magical twilight
754,"00:45:26,723","00:45:30,226",The warmest rain
755,"00:45:30,686","00:45:34,814",Hear it whispering your names?
756,"00:45:34,982","00:45:38,276",Rainbows at midnight
757,"00:45:38,444","00:45:41,320",Sparkling night skies
758,"00:45:41,488","00:45:45,408",Don't go away
759,"00:45:45,576","00:45:49,495",Stay another day
760,"00:45:50,914","00:45:53,249","Can you sing it again, please?"
761,"00:45:54,209","00:45:56,502","Time for bed, now."
762,"00:46:02,259","00:46:04,969",What an amazing day.
763,"00:46:05,137","00:46:07,555",All this time...
764,"00:46:07,723","00:46:12,435","I never let myself hope
that they were alive."
765,"00:46:13,645","00:46:15,104",But they are.
766,"00:46:16,607","00:46:19,233","We found our family, Blu."
767,"00:46:20,944","00:46:23,654",This changes everything.
768,"00:46:23,822","00:46:25,198",Yeah.
769,"00:46:25,365","00:46:28,701",Wait. What? What's changing?
770,"00:46:30,787","00:46:32,330",Jewel?
771,"00:47:07,950","00:47:10,284","Shoo, shoo, shoo. Go on."
772,"00:47:36,395","00:47:39,480","Honey, stop. That tickles."
773,"00:47:45,737","00:47:47,154",That was fun!
774,"00:47:49,366","00:47:50,533",Tiago!
775,"00:47:51,410","00:47:53,077","Come on, Tiago. Let's go."
776,"00:48:03,171","00:48:04,380",Morning.
777,"00:48:04,548","00:48:06,924","Or should I say ""afternoon""?"
778,"00:48:09,344","00:48:10,344","Morning, sir."
779,"00:48:10,470","00:48:12,888","Our days here in the jungle,
they start early."
780,"00:48:13,098","00:48:14,348","Morning, Daddy."
781,"00:48:14,516","00:48:17,143","That's my girl. See?
Already up and at 'em."
782,"00:48:17,311","00:48:18,352","Morning, sweetie."
783,"00:48:19,354","00:48:20,730",Why did you let me sleep in?
784,"00:48:20,897","00:48:23,274","What are you talking about?
You sleep in every day."
785,"00:48:23,442","00:48:24,859","- Yeah, but...
- Hey, Dad."
786,"00:48:25,027","00:48:27,028","Aunt Mimi says
clay is good for your digestion."
787,"00:48:27,195","00:48:29,036","- Try some.
- No, sweetie. I just brushed my..."
788,"00:48:29,072","00:48:31,449","It's good, right?
I'm gonna go get some more."
789,"00:48:31,867","00:48:33,200",Smart girl.
790,"00:48:36,288","00:48:39,540","So, I thought I'd take Louie, here,
for a little tour of the area."
791,"00:48:39,708","00:48:40,875",Show him around.
792,"00:48:41,043","00:48:42,460","- That's a great idea.
- What?"
793,"00:48:42,628","00:48:46,005","You go have fun with Daddy,
and I'll explore around here with the kids."
794,"00:48:47,049","00:48:48,633","- Yeah, okay. Sure.
- You'll love it."
795,"00:48:48,800","00:48:51,093","Yeah, great. I just gotta..."
796,"00:48:56,725","00:48:58,059","Okay, ready."
797,"00:49:01,521","00:49:02,813",Okay.
798,"00:49:03,315","00:49:05,274","Lou, come closer."
799,"00:49:09,821","00:49:11,656","- Not so close.
- Okay."
800,"00:49:11,823","00:49:13,324",Listen...
801,"00:49:13,492","00:49:16,661","I can barely look at it.
You gotta lose that human pocket, okay?"
802,"00:49:16,912","00:49:18,371",This is a fanny pack.
803,"00:49:18,538","00:49:20,998","""Fanny pack."" Adorable."
804,"00:49:21,166","00:49:22,375",It's human.
805,"00:49:22,542","00:49:26,045","And now that you're joining the tribe,
you won't be needing it anymore."
806,"00:49:26,213","00:49:28,547",I'll meet you by the clay banks.
807,"00:49:29,091","00:49:30,174","""Joining the tribe""?"
808,"00:49:30,342","00:49:32,782","He doesn't actually think
we're moving to the jungle, does he?"
809,"00:49:32,886","00:49:36,180",No. He's just excited we're all here.
810,"00:49:36,348","00:49:38,015","Let's not ruin the moment, okay?"
811,"00:49:38,183","00:49:42,103","Besides, it won't kill you
to leave behind the fanny pack."
812,"00:49:42,270","00:49:46,023","All right, you win.
I will leave the fanny pack behind."
813,"00:49:47,609","00:49:49,235","Happy wife, happy li..."
814,"00:49:49,403","00:49:50,403","Bye, honey."
815,"00:49:50,612","00:49:51,821",Have fun.
816,"00:49:52,072","00:49:55,408",Yeah. Sure. Bye.
817,"00:50:05,836","00:50:09,171",You guys. Wakey-wakey!
818,"00:50:09,339","00:50:11,966","- Wake up!
- Eva! You got it!"
819,"00:50:12,134","00:50:14,677","What happened to ""Amazon Untamed""?"
820,"00:50:14,845","00:50:16,762",Here's the plan. Auditions today...
821,"00:50:16,930","00:50:19,014",and we preview the show tomorrow.
822,"00:50:19,182","00:50:21,600","""We""? What you talking about, ""we""?
You speak French?"
823,"00:50:21,768","00:50:24,979","Come on, chop-chop. Let's get started!"
824,"00:50:27,023","00:50:28,232",Kid's been working.
825,"00:50:30,360","00:50:32,403","Tell me when to go
Tell me when to go"
826,"00:50:32,571","00:50:34,238","Tell me when to go
Tell me when to go!"
827,"00:50:37,075","00:50:39,952","'Cause shawty got low, low, low, low, low"
828,"00:50:42,205","00:50:43,706",Any time you're ready.
829,"00:50:44,583","00:50:45,666",Every time I come a fella gotta get it
830,"00:50:45,834","00:50:47,460","Then I gotta go, and then I gotta get it
Then they gotta blow"
831,"00:50:47,627","00:50:49,628","And then I gotta show that any little thing
A fella think that he be doing"
832,"00:50:49,796","00:50:51,338","'Cause it doesn't matter, I'm done"
833,"00:50:57,990","00:50:58,990",Next!
834,"00:50:59,014","00:51:02,308",We are the amazing Capoeira Turtles.
835,"00:51:11,902","00:51:13,223","- Bravo! Encore! Encore!
- Encore!"
836,"00:51:13,904","00:51:15,946","Sorry, guys. Did I miss anything?"
837,"00:51:16,198","00:51:17,698",Mosquito.
838,"00:51:35,342","00:51:37,551","Hi, my name is Claira the capybara..."
839,"00:51:37,719","00:51:40,387",and I will be singing my favorite song.
840,"00:51:42,098","00:51:44,391",Memory
841,"00:51:44,559","00:51:48,354",All alone in the moonlight
842,"00:51:54,569","00:51:56,737",Touch me
843,"00:51:56,905","00:52:00,699",It's so easy to leave me
844,"00:52:00,951","00:52:02,910","If they keep eating each other,
we got no show."
845,"00:52:03,078","00:52:05,120","This ain't an
all-you-can-eat competition!"
846,"00:52:12,754","00:52:16,090","Hey. You are fast.
You are really, really fast."
847,"00:52:16,258","00:52:19,178","I think I pulled a wing or something.
You are really fast for an old bird."
848,"00:52:19,344","00:52:23,180","For such a wise bird,
is what I meant to say. Wise bird."
849,"00:52:23,348","00:52:24,932",Which sometimes comes with age...
850,"00:52:25,100","00:52:26,809","but also can happen when you're young,
like in your case."
851,"00:52:26,977","00:52:29,228","You could be wise and young,
which is kind of a rare combination..."
852,"00:52:29,396","00:52:30,596",but thrilling when it happens.
853,"00:52:30,689","00:52:32,106","- Be quiet.
- Thank you, sir."
854,"00:52:32,274","00:52:33,875",It's time to shake that city off of you.
855,"00:52:33,984","00:52:36,569","You need to learn
the basics of jungle survival."
856,"00:52:36,736","00:52:38,237",I thought we were going sightseeing.
857,"00:52:39,322","00:52:41,156",It's training day.
858,"00:52:42,325","00:52:44,451",Come on! The mud is your friend.
859,"00:52:44,619","00:52:47,496","This is your camouflage!
Feel it. Taste it!"
860,"00:52:47,664","00:52:50,416","If you don't feel crusty,
you're not doing it right!"
861,"00:52:51,668","00:52:53,961",You don't wanna be seen by humans!
862,"00:52:54,129","00:52:56,839","Come on!
Are you a macaw or a turkey?"
863,"00:53:03,597","00:53:05,306",Faster. Faster.
864,"00:53:05,599","00:53:08,434","Come on!
You don't wanna be eaten!"
865,"00:53:10,520","00:53:13,981","You're alone in the jungle.
You get caught in a trap."
866,"00:53:14,149","00:53:15,774",What do you do?
867,"00:53:15,942","00:53:17,151",If I had my fanny pack...
868,"00:53:17,319","00:53:18,819",No! You use your beak.
869,"00:53:18,987","00:53:20,667","- My beak.
- It's your most important tool."
870,"00:53:20,780","00:53:22,823","Okay, okay. No, I use my beak."
871,"00:53:23,450","00:53:25,492","- Almost.
- Time's up!"
872,"00:53:25,660","00:53:27,286",You're jaguar meat.
873,"00:53:27,454","00:53:29,204",Roberto got it on the first try.
874,"00:53:29,831","00:53:31,123",Of course he did.
875,"00:53:31,499","00:53:34,627","Up, up! And hover!"
876,"00:53:34,794","00:53:36,462","- Now, backwards!
- What, backwards?"
877,"00:53:36,630","00:53:38,505","No, only hummingbirds can fly backwards."
878,"00:53:38,673","00:53:40,215",Backwards.
879,"00:53:40,550","00:53:42,343",Over! Under! Over!
880,"00:53:42,677","00:53:44,637",Under! Over!
881,"00:53:44,804","00:53:46,472","- Good job.
- Thanks."
882,"00:53:46,640","00:53:47,848",Not you.
883,"00:53:48,850","00:53:49,975",Hi.
884,"00:53:51,603","00:53:53,145",Brazil nut trees.
885,"00:53:53,647","00:53:58,025","These trees are the key
to our way of life."
886,"00:53:58,818","00:54:01,070",The trees feed us.
887,"00:54:01,655","00:54:03,489",They sustain us.
888,"00:54:07,827","00:54:09,912","- Wake up!
- I'm up."
889,"00:54:10,080","00:54:11,997","Nutty Brazil...
Brazil nut trees, something."
890,"00:54:12,165","00:54:13,332","Yeah, got it."
891,"00:54:13,500","00:54:16,627","This is important.
We have to protect these trees."
892,"00:54:16,795","00:54:18,671",Our future depends on it.
893,"00:54:18,838","00:54:19,838","Yo, Eddie."
894,"00:54:20,173","00:54:21,340",Who is your sidekick?
895,"00:54:21,508","00:54:23,217",You got a nurse now?
896,"00:54:23,987","00:54:24,987","Hi, I'm..."
897,"00:54:25,011","00:54:27,680","Aren't you boys getting
a little bit too close to our side?"
898,"00:54:27,847","00:54:29,056","We have a deal, Felipe."
899,"00:54:29,224","00:54:30,724","Hey, relax."
900,"00:54:30,892","00:54:33,060","You know we got nothing
but mad love for you."
901,"00:54:33,228","00:54:34,979","Come on, boys, let's fly."
902,"00:54:35,146","00:54:39,066",Paint the sky. Before they start to cry.
903,"00:54:39,526","00:54:41,727","- They seem nice.
- They have their side of the grove..."
904,"00:54:41,861","00:54:42,987",and we have ours.
905,"00:54:43,196","00:54:45,239",Food is scarce these days.
906,"00:54:55,875","00:54:58,168","Never seen them
this close to the village before."
907,"00:54:58,336","00:54:59,086",What?
908,"00:54:59,254","00:55:01,922","- Don't let them see you!
- Right, right. Sorry."
909,"00:55:02,716","00:55:04,383",Maybe we should go find Linda.
910,"00:55:04,551","00:55:07,678","- What's a Linda?
- Linda is the person that raised me."
911,"00:55:07,846","00:55:09,555",What? You're a pet?
912,"00:55:09,723","00:55:13,225","No, it wasn't anything like that.
I was a companion."
913,"00:55:13,393","00:55:16,186","You liked it?
That explains everything."
914,"00:55:16,354","00:55:18,522","- Linda is family.
- Family?"
915,"00:55:18,732","00:55:20,733",Humans aren't family.
916,"00:55:20,900","00:55:22,568","No, you don't understand.
They're coming here to help."
917,"00:55:22,736","00:55:23,527",Listen to me.
918,"00:55:23,695","00:55:26,405",We do not bring humans into the tribe.
919,"00:55:26,573","00:55:28,615","That is the only reason
we're still alive."
920,"00:55:28,783","00:55:31,910","You cannot be confused about this.
Understood?"
921,"00:55:32,245","00:55:33,787",Yeah. Got it.
922,"00:55:34,581","00:55:36,957",Sightseeing is over.
923,"00:55:42,756","00:55:44,423",Do you see the nest?
924,"00:55:48,178","00:55:49,720","Tulio, are you okay?"
925,"00:55:50,055","00:55:52,431",I'm fine! I'm okay!
926,"00:55:56,269","00:55:57,686",Not okay.
927,"00:56:02,108","00:56:04,443","Tulio, they're cutting down the forest!"
928,"00:56:04,611","00:56:06,278","Linda, where are you going?"
929,"00:56:06,446","00:56:09,531","To talk to them.
You talk to birds, I talk to humans."
930,"00:56:09,699","00:56:11,283","No! Wait, don't!"
931,"00:56:12,786","00:56:14,953","Hey! Hey, mister!"
932,"00:56:15,121","00:56:16,872",Hello!
933,"00:56:17,040","00:56:19,208",You take it easy with that chainsaw.
934,"00:56:19,918","00:56:24,797","There are rare birds living around here.
You can't cut down these trees!"
935,"00:56:25,131","00:56:27,758",Sweetheart! There you are.
936,"00:56:28,093","00:56:29,384",I was looking for you.
937,"00:56:29,552","00:56:32,471","Hi, there. Beautiful out here, isn't it?"
938,"00:56:33,473","00:56:34,598",You two lost?
939,"00:56:36,267","00:56:37,935",Lost? No!
940,"00:56:38,978","00:56:39,978",Lost?
941,"00:56:40,396","00:56:41,480",No.
942,"00:56:41,648","00:56:44,316",We're here on our honeymoon.
943,"00:56:44,484","00:56:46,985","We're actually just heading back
to join the tour."
944,"00:56:47,153","00:56:49,488",It's karaoke night.
945,"00:56:49,989","00:56:53,325","Come along, honey.
Moon River isn't going to sing itself."
946,"00:56:53,660","00:56:57,079","Linda, logs aren't the only things
these guys cut."
947,"00:56:58,748","00:57:00,499","Run, Linda. I'll hold them off."
948,"00:57:00,667","00:57:03,669","- Go, go, go! Run!
- Okay, okay, okay!"
949,"00:57:09,425","00:57:10,592","Excuse me, excuse me!"
950,"00:57:15,974","00:57:16,974","Come on, I'll race you."
951,"00:57:17,934","00:57:20,727","- This is great!
- All right, Tiago!"
952,"00:57:20,895","00:57:21,895","Oh, yeah!"
953,"00:57:22,063","00:57:23,689",Tiago!
954,"00:57:24,941","00:57:25,941",Hey!
955,"00:57:30,864","00:57:32,239",That is so good.
956,"00:57:32,407","00:57:33,866","Hey, you're back."
957,"00:57:34,826","00:57:36,702",How did it go?
958,"00:57:37,871","00:57:41,540","We had a great time.
It was educational."
959,"00:57:41,708","00:57:44,668","Dad! Uncle Beto showed me
some cool flying tricks."
960,"00:57:44,836","00:57:45,836","""Uncle""?"
961,"00:57:45,920","00:57:48,130","Look, I can fly backwards."
962,"00:57:48,298","00:57:50,215","Yeah, you're a natural, T-Bird."
963,"00:57:53,344","00:57:56,054","It's never too soon
to learn the ways of the jungle, Tiago."
964,"00:57:57,056","00:57:59,141","Although, some may never learn."
965,"00:58:00,935","00:58:03,270",I'm gonna go clean up.
966,"00:58:05,190","00:58:08,192","Roberto, we saw humans near the grove."
967,"00:58:08,359","00:58:10,611",I need you to stay alert.
968,"00:58:11,988","00:58:13,071","""Ways of the jungle."""
969,"00:58:13,239","00:58:15,741","I would like to learn a way
out of this jungle."
970,"00:58:21,915","00:58:24,791",There he is. Now is our chance.
971,"00:58:24,959","00:58:26,168",I'm so excited!
972,"00:58:26,336","00:58:28,003",Prepare the tongue-a-pult.
973,"00:58:32,217","00:58:35,385","Charlie, make me fly again."
974,"00:58:36,471","00:58:37,930","Go get them, tiger!"
975,"00:58:43,186","00:58:45,187",Bow before the conquering cockatoo.
976,"00:58:45,730","00:58:47,439","What is your problem, dude?"
977,"00:58:47,982","00:58:49,900","Bird, that was sick!"
978,"00:58:50,068","00:58:52,236","Now, that's the energy
you bring into an audition."
979,"00:58:52,612","00:58:53,612",Audition?
980,"00:58:53,655","00:58:55,822","Yeah, that's actually why I'm here."
981,"00:58:55,990","00:58:57,449",I've got a great little...
982,"00:58:58,470","00:58:59,470",Go on.
983,"00:58:59,494","00:59:01,662",We're looking for a new star.
984,"00:59:02,038","00:59:03,247",Star?
985,"00:59:03,414","00:59:06,541","You look familiar.
Don't I know you from somewhere?"
986,"00:59:06,876","00:59:10,087","No, I don't think so. No. I'm..."
987,"00:59:10,922","00:59:14,925","Bob. Yes. Bob, the bird."
988,"00:59:16,135","00:59:18,387","Okay, Bob, whatever.
Show us what you got."
989,"00:59:21,849","00:59:25,018","Well, at first I was afraid"
990,"00:59:25,186","00:59:26,937",I was petrified
991,"00:59:27,605","00:59:30,524",I kept thinking that I could never live
992,"00:59:30,692","00:59:33,610",I could barely fly
993,"00:59:33,903","00:59:36,530","And I spent, oh, so many nights"
994,"00:59:36,698","00:59:39,241",thinking how he did me wrong
995,"00:59:39,409","00:59:41,493",And I grew strong
996,"00:59:41,661","00:59:45,664",And I learned how to get along
997,"00:59:45,832","00:59:48,834","Go on, now, go Walk out the door"
998,"00:59:49,961","00:59:51,628",Just turn around now
999,"00:59:52,213","00:59:54,047",It is I who have the floor
1000,"00:59:54,966","00:59:57,843","Weren't you the one
who tried to hurt me with goodbye?"
1001,"00:59:58,011","01:00:00,095","- Did you think I'd crumble?
- Oh, no!"
1002,"01:00:00,263","01:00:02,139",Did you think I'd lay down and die?
1003,"01:00:02,307","01:00:03,307","Oh, no, not Nige"
1004,"01:00:03,349","01:00:06,643",I will survive
1005,"01:00:06,811","01:00:08,854",As long as I know how to hate
1006,"01:00:09,022","01:00:10,981",I know I'll stay alive
1007,"01:00:12,358","01:00:14,109",I've got all my life to live
1008,"01:00:14,277","01:00:15,902",And I've got all my love to give
1009,"01:00:16,070","01:00:17,988","- And I will survive
- You will survive"
1010,"01:00:18,156","01:00:20,282","- I will survive
- We will survive"
1011,"01:00:20,450","01:00:22,743","I'm a survivor
I've got the eye of a tiger"
1012,"01:00:22,910","01:00:24,430","Been training again
And eating my fiber"
1013,"01:00:24,495","01:00:26,872","You been staying alive
Well, I've been staying alive-er"
1014,"01:00:27,040","01:00:29,416","Watch where you sit
when I spit my saliva, like boom"
1015,"01:00:29,709","01:00:30,959",You've never seen a cockatoo
1016,"01:00:31,127","01:00:33,045","Rocking and shocking and dropping
And popping and locking, too?"
1017,"01:00:33,212","01:00:35,839","Watch what I can do
Without no Auto-Tune"
1018,"01:00:36,007","01:00:37,007",Say what?
1019,"01:00:39,988","01:00:40,988","Oh, no, he didn't."
1020,"01:00:41,012","01:00:42,804",If you try to keep me down
1021,"01:00:42,972","01:00:45,265",I'll just come back stronger
1022,"01:00:45,433","01:00:46,975",You try to cut me short
1023,"01:00:47,101","01:00:49,353",I'll just come back longer
1024,"01:00:49,520","01:00:53,523","If you beat me at ping pong
I'll just play ping pong-er"
1025,"01:00:53,691","01:00:55,442","Give me my throne, I am ready to thrive"
1026,"01:00:55,651","01:00:56,651",One thing I know
1027,"01:00:57,320","01:00:58,987",I will survive
1028,"01:00:59,197","01:01:05,160",I will survive
1029,"01:01:08,414","01:01:10,332","Yes, thank you. I've been Bob the bird."
1030,"01:01:12,085","01:01:14,002",He is so hot.
1031,"01:01:14,170","01:01:15,796",Boom. That's it. You in.
1032,"01:01:15,963","01:01:18,131","You're no Eva, but you're awesome."
1033,"01:01:18,299","01:01:20,425","We'll see you at the performance
tomorrow night."
1034,"01:01:20,593","01:01:24,137","Everyone from the village is coming.
It's gonna be off the charts."
1035,"01:01:24,555","01:01:26,014",Everyone?
1036,"01:01:26,182","01:01:27,307",Everyone?
1037,"01:01:27,475","01:01:29,017",It's the perfect plan.
1038,"01:01:29,936","01:01:32,771","Be happy we're only
plucking you, porcupine."
1039,"01:01:33,773","01:01:34,940",Go away.
1040,"01:01:35,441","01:01:38,110","Instead of chasing that bird
all over the jungle..."
1041,"01:01:38,277","01:01:42,280","we let him come to us,
at the Carnival show."
1042,"01:01:42,448","01:01:46,159","I'll mesmerize them from the stage,
while in the audience..."
1043,"01:01:46,327","01:01:48,120","you, my little Gabi..."
1044,"01:01:48,955","01:01:53,125","you'll be my petite
weapon of mass destruction."
1045,"01:01:53,292","01:01:55,377",It will be a performance...
1046,"01:01:56,838","01:01:58,213",to die for.
1047,"01:02:04,971","01:02:06,555",It only works when I do it.
1048,"01:02:06,722","01:02:08,849",Okay. Love you.
1049,"01:02:18,317","01:02:20,152",So minty.
1050,"01:02:25,658","01:02:26,658",Yes!
1051,"01:02:33,249","01:02:36,501","Hey, sweetie, there you are.
What's taking you so long?"
1052,"01:02:36,669","01:02:38,420","Enough with that GPS, really."
1053,"01:02:38,588","01:02:40,829","The whole tribe's gathering
to watch the sunset. Come on."
1054,"01:02:40,840","01:02:43,758","No, no. Hang on.
I just found Linda and Tulio's coordinates."
1055,"01:02:43,926","01:02:45,343","They are just
on the other side of the grove."
1056,"01:02:45,511","01:02:46,845","Look, they're really close."
1057,"01:02:47,490","01:02:48,490",Yeah.
1058,"01:02:48,514","01:02:50,265","Now, I know your dad
doesn't totally trust humans..."
1059,"01:02:50,433","01:02:52,601","but I'm sure if he met them,
he would change his mind."
1060,"01:02:52,768","01:02:54,227",They can help keep this place safe.
1061,"01:02:54,395","01:02:55,437","Yeah, Blu..."
1062,"01:02:55,605","01:02:57,355",my dad knows what he's doing.
1063,"01:02:58,900","01:03:02,777","And can't you just forget Linda and Tulio
for one minute and enjoy a sunset?"
1064,"01:03:02,945","01:03:04,696",But I thought that was our plan.
1065,"01:03:04,864","01:03:06,573",Route guidance complete.
1066,"01:03:08,701","01:03:12,704","You know, maybe some places
shouldn't be found."
1067,"01:03:13,289","01:03:16,041",Maybe they should just be left alone.
1068,"01:03:19,420","01:03:21,546",She ate a bug. A bug!
1069,"01:03:21,714","01:03:23,798","Blu, Blu, Blu! Calm down."
1070,"01:03:23,966","01:03:25,550",Calm down? We had a plan.
1071,"01:03:25,718","01:03:27,886","Help Linda and Tulio find the flock
and get home."
1072,"01:03:28,054","01:03:30,414","But when I mentioned it to her,
she completely shut me down."
1073,"01:03:31,807","01:03:33,892",And her father? A total nut job.
1074,"01:03:34,060","01:03:35,727",He's got this weird thing about humans.
1075,"01:03:35,895","01:03:37,896",He's got this weird thing about humans!
1076,"01:03:38,064","01:03:40,106",He loves them. He's a pet!
1077,"01:03:40,733","01:03:41,733",A pet?
1078,"01:03:41,901","01:03:43,109",He called me a pet.
1079,"01:03:43,277","01:03:45,570","I can't believe he used
the ""P"" word to my face."
1080,"01:03:45,738","01:03:47,322","It's like he thinks
I'm the enemy or something."
1081,"01:03:47,490","01:03:50,742","He's not one of us, Roberto.
Keep an eye on him."
1082,"01:03:50,910","01:03:53,161",And that Roberto? He is always watching.
1083,"01:03:53,329","01:03:56,873","He is always hovering around Jewel.
He is always singing something."
1084,"01:03:57,041","01:03:58,250",I can't compete with that.
1085,"01:03:58,417","01:03:59,417","You gotta bird up, bird!"
1086,"01:03:59,544","01:04:01,711","You gotta emancipate yourself
from domestication."
1087,"01:04:01,879","01:04:03,797",Try to see this place through her eyes.
1088,"01:04:03,965","01:04:06,800",Taste the flavors she's tasting.
1089,"01:04:06,968","01:04:08,260",So I should eat a bug?
1090,"01:04:08,427","01:04:09,469","That's just nasty, thinking about it."
1091,"01:04:09,637","01:04:11,555",Glitter. Where is my glitter?
1092,"01:04:11,722","01:04:12,722",I'm sorry. Sorry.
1093,"01:04:12,807","01:04:15,600",I don't want apologies. I want glitter.
1094,"01:04:16,143","01:04:19,312","Glitter is absolutely essential
for a magical performance."
1095,"01:04:19,480","01:04:21,273","- Do you know nothing?
- Guys!"
1096,"01:04:21,440","01:04:23,650","Rehearsals, big day tomorrow."
1097,"01:04:23,818","01:04:26,987","Ring a bell? Come on.
You're coming, right, Dad?"
1098,"01:04:27,154","01:04:28,446","Oh, yeah, of course."
1099,"01:04:28,614","01:04:31,491","That girl put the ""business""
in ""show business."""
1100,"01:04:31,659","01:04:32,659","Blu, remember..."
1101,"01:04:32,785","01:04:36,162","I know, I know. Happy wife, happy life."
1102,"01:04:40,626","01:04:43,461",What a glorious morning!
1103,"01:04:46,841","01:04:50,302","I forgot I could have
mornings like this."
1104,"01:04:56,309","01:04:57,809",Yeah.
1105,"01:05:01,772","01:05:02,981",Your favorite.
1106,"01:05:03,774","01:05:05,150",You remembered.
1107,"01:05:05,318","01:05:07,777",Isn't that nice?
1108,"01:05:11,657","01:05:14,159",It's so crazy good.
1109,"01:05:14,327","01:05:16,536","Thank you so much, Blu."
1110,"01:05:21,792","01:05:23,376",That's it!
1111,"01:05:28,507","01:05:30,508",I'll be the one to surprise her.
1112,"01:05:30,676","01:05:33,720","Breakfast in bed, coming up."
1113,"01:06:10,049","01:06:12,050",Brazil nuts.
1114,"01:06:12,218","01:06:14,219",Where are you?
1115,"01:06:17,348","01:06:19,516",I know you're around here somewhere.
1116,"01:06:22,937","01:06:24,729",Hey! Hey.
1117,"01:06:24,897","01:06:26,398",No! Come back here. Wait!
1118,"01:06:26,565","01:06:27,857",No!
1119,"01:06:28,025","01:06:29,025",That's not a toy.
1120,"01:06:29,276","01:06:31,069",Erratic driving. Pull over.
1121,"01:06:40,955","01:06:42,205","No, no. Don't do it."
1122,"01:07:03,102","01:07:04,102",I got you!
1123,"01:07:04,478","01:07:06,229",Thank you.
1124,"01:07:08,941","01:07:09,941",Finally!
1125,"01:07:10,234","01:07:11,609",Brazil nuts.
1126,"01:07:15,698","01:07:18,783",This is my most important tool.
1127,"01:07:35,384","01:07:39,387","Well, well, well. What do we have here?"
1128,"01:07:41,432","01:07:46,102","I guess old Eddie's rules
don't apply to everyone."
1129,"01:07:48,773","01:07:50,774",You're on our side.
1130,"01:07:50,941","01:07:52,400","Really? Okay, my bad."
1131,"01:07:52,568","01:07:53,943",I didn't know that. Sorry.
1132,"01:07:54,987","01:07:56,821",Sorry! Sorry.
1133,"01:07:58,157","01:08:00,992","You come over here, take our food..."
1134,"01:08:01,160","01:08:03,161",and now you insult me?
1135,"01:08:04,246","01:08:07,499","No, no, no.
This is all just a big misunderstanding."
1136,"01:08:08,167","01:08:11,127","You know,
I wish I could accept your apology."
1137,"01:08:11,295","01:08:14,005",You seem like a nice bird.
1138,"01:08:14,173","01:08:15,590",But this means war!
1139,"01:08:15,758","01:08:19,344","What? Does it have to?
Can it mean something else?"
1140,"01:08:19,512","01:08:22,096","Today, in the Pit of Doom."
1141,"01:08:22,807","01:08:24,516","Sorry, the ""Pit of Doom""? Really?"
1142,"01:08:25,351","01:08:26,351",Really?
1143,"01:08:26,435","01:08:29,854",High noon. I'll make some room.
1144,"01:08:30,022","01:08:32,607",Sweep you up like a broom.
1145,"01:08:40,199","01:08:41,199",You did what?
1146,"01:08:41,367","01:08:42,367",It was an accident.
1147,"01:08:42,493","01:08:44,369","- An accident?
- Hey, what's going on?"
1148,"01:08:44,537","01:08:47,330","Thanks to Drew, here, we could lose
our entire side of the grove."
1149,"01:08:47,498","01:08:49,791",I was just trying to get a nut. One nut!
1150,"01:08:49,959","01:08:52,877","You don't even like nuts!
What's gotten into you, Blu?"
1151,"01:08:53,045","01:08:54,712",I was getting it for you.
1152,"01:08:54,880","01:08:56,673",You were?
1153,"01:08:56,841","01:08:59,217","Roberto, I want your best birds on this."
1154,"01:08:59,385","01:09:01,052",We are not giving up without a fight.
1155,"01:09:01,220","01:09:02,220",Got it.
1156,"01:09:02,304","01:09:04,389",You. Stay out of it.
1157,"01:09:04,557","01:09:05,723",You've done enough.
1158,"01:09:05,891","01:09:07,392","- Wait!
- Blu, he's right."
1159,"01:09:07,560","01:09:09,394","Maybe you should just let
Dad and Roberto handle it."
1160,"01:09:09,562","01:09:11,062",You don't think I can do this?
1161,"01:09:11,230","01:09:13,565","No, I just don't know..."
1162,"01:09:13,732","01:09:18,027",if it's your exact area of expertise.
1163,"01:09:18,487","01:09:21,739","Let's go, let's go, let's go!
Pit of Doom, now!"
1164,"01:09:40,593","01:09:42,093",Radio!
1165,"01:09:45,764","01:09:47,891",I hope you don't mind.
1166,"01:09:48,684","01:09:50,435",I made myself at home.
1167,"01:09:50,895","01:09:52,520",Lollipop?
1168,"01:10:00,613","01:10:05,408","It's a shame, really. You came all
this way to protect the jungle."
1169,"01:10:05,576","01:10:08,536",Let's see if it will return the favor.
1170,"01:10:08,704","01:10:10,455",Tree huggers.
1171,"01:10:21,550","01:10:22,967",Roberto.
1172,"01:10:23,135","01:10:24,886",Felipe.
1173,"01:10:27,932","01:10:29,390",No mercy!
1174,"01:10:29,558","01:10:30,600",I have to stop this.
1175,"01:10:30,768","01:10:31,768",What? Blu!
1176,"01:10:31,894","01:10:33,436",Stop! Stop!
1177,"01:10:33,604","01:10:34,896","Eduardo, this is crazy."
1178,"01:10:35,064","01:10:37,944","We are an intelligent species with
advanced problem-solving capabilities."
1179,"01:10:38,108","01:10:40,652","You brought this on us. Now, watch."
1180,"01:10:54,333","01:10:55,333",Heads.
1181,"01:10:55,334","01:10:56,334",Tails.
1182,"01:10:57,711","01:10:59,295",I hate this job.
1183,"01:11:05,636","01:11:07,345",It's a game. It's a game!
1184,"01:11:07,513","01:11:10,348",It's not a game! It's war.
1185,"01:11:12,685","01:11:14,686",It's a beautiful day in the Pit of Doom!
1186,"01:11:14,853","01:11:16,813",It's winner take all!
1187,"01:11:16,981","01:11:18,356",It's the best of seven.
1188,"01:11:18,524","01:11:22,652","The winner will take control
of the entire Brazil nut grove!"
1189,"01:11:22,861","01:11:24,570",It's just like soccer. I can do this.
1190,"01:11:24,738","01:11:26,099","All right, any special strategies?"
1191,"01:11:26,198","01:11:27,991","What are we running at,
4-4-2 or a 5-4-1?"
1192,"01:11:28,158","01:11:30,034","What are we doing here, coach?
What position do I play?"
1193,"01:11:30,202","01:11:32,578","Actually, I do have
a perfect spot for you."
1194,"01:11:33,038","01:11:36,207",Water. Water here. Get your water.
1195,"01:11:36,375","01:11:37,375","Okay, thanks."
1196,"01:11:37,418","01:11:41,921","Roberto is unstoppable!
He's incredible! He's everywhere!"
1197,"01:11:42,089","01:11:43,423","Go, Roberto!"
1198,"01:11:43,590","01:11:44,716",I could have done that.
1199,"01:11:44,883","01:11:46,092",Roberto springs free!
1200,"01:11:46,260","01:11:48,421","There he goes, there he goes,
there he goes! He shoots!"
1201,"01:11:49,930","01:11:50,930",Goal!
1202,"01:11:51,098","01:11:52,098",Goal!
1203,"01:11:52,099","01:11:54,100",Goal! Goal!
1204,"01:11:54,268","01:11:55,893",Goal!
1205,"01:11:58,397","01:11:59,564","Oh, my!"
1206,"01:12:00,941","01:12:02,942",Felipe has the ball. The Red Macaws...
1207,"01:12:03,110","01:12:04,235",are making a comeback.
1208,"01:12:04,403","01:12:06,112",Felipe pass to Tito. Tito with Mario.
1209,"01:12:06,280","01:12:08,406",Mario with Cesar. Cesar to Antonio.
1210,"01:12:08,574","01:12:10,241",Felipe scores!
1211,"01:12:10,576","01:12:13,036",Yes! In your face!
1212,"01:12:13,203","01:12:16,247","Felipe, Roberto. Roberto, Felipe.
Roberto, Felipe. Felipe, Roberto!"
1213,"01:12:20,753","01:12:22,045",Goal!
1214,"01:12:24,131","01:12:25,131",That has got to hurt.
1215,"01:12:25,257","01:12:26,591","Go, go!"
1216,"01:12:27,634","01:12:31,429",Felipe-lipe-lipe!
1217,"01:12:32,765","01:12:33,765",Hey!
1218,"01:12:33,932","01:12:34,932",Foul!
1219,"01:12:34,933","01:12:36,059","Come on, ref!"
1220,"01:12:37,603","01:12:38,603","Okay, you're in."
1221,"01:12:38,771","01:12:39,395",Really?
1222,"01:12:39,563","01:12:40,938",Not you. You.
1223,"01:12:41,899","01:12:43,107",Watch and learn...
1224,"01:12:43,275","01:12:44,442",water boy.
1225,"01:12:45,819","01:12:47,570","All right, just get in there."
1226,"01:12:47,780","01:12:48,780",Yes!
1227,"01:12:49,573","01:12:51,115","Okay. Here we go, coach."
1228,"01:12:51,283","01:12:52,283","Yeah, Dad!"
1229,"01:12:52,284","01:12:55,828","A new player is coming off the bench.
Is he a secret weapon?"
1230,"01:12:57,247","01:12:58,748",I think it's the water boy.
1231,"01:12:58,916","01:12:59,916","Hey, I'm open!"
1232,"01:13:00,084","01:13:01,459","I'm open, toss it to me!"
1233,"01:13:01,627","01:13:04,253","Hey, pass to me, I'm open.
I'm wide open!"
1234,"01:13:04,421","01:13:06,464",Pass the ball to me!
1235,"01:13:08,842","01:13:10,259","Thanks for the pass, Blu!"
1236,"01:13:10,427","01:13:11,427",Mind if I borrow this?
1237,"01:13:11,595","01:13:13,471",Roberto moves in. He shakes one...
1238,"01:13:13,639","01:13:14,639",then another!
1239,"01:13:14,681","01:13:15,681",Roberto!
1240,"01:13:15,808","01:13:17,141",Goal!
1241,"01:13:17,309","01:13:20,144","Oh, yeah! Oh, yeah!"
1242,"01:13:28,320","01:13:29,987",We are tied in the Pit of Doom.
1243,"01:13:30,155","01:13:31,823",Whoever scores next...
1244,"01:13:31,990","01:13:33,199",wins it all!
1245,"01:13:33,492","01:13:34,992","I got it, I got it!"
1246,"01:13:37,287","01:13:38,287","Come on, Blu."
1247,"01:13:43,460","01:13:46,879","Wow! The water boy is suddenly
playing like a pro!"
1248,"01:13:54,179","01:13:55,513",Pass the ball to Roberto!
1249,"01:13:57,975","01:13:59,684",Pass the ball! Pass the ball!
1250,"01:13:59,852","01:14:02,353","- Blu, wait!
- No, this bird's got it covered."
1251,"01:14:18,579","01:14:20,413",Goal!
1252,"01:14:27,546","01:14:30,548","It looks like the secret weapon
just backfired!"
1253,"01:14:30,716","01:14:33,217",Let's go to Eduardo for his reaction.
1254,"01:14:34,720","01:14:38,014","I'm gonna kill you, fanny pack!"
1255,"01:14:47,900","01:14:49,192","Check it out, old Eddie."
1256,"01:14:49,359","01:14:53,070","Looks like you guys are
going to have to start a nut-free diet."
1257,"01:14:54,698","01:14:57,408","We're gonna be talking about that
for a long time."
1258,"01:15:01,538","01:15:05,124","I should never have expected more
from a human's pet."
1259,"01:15:20,933","01:15:22,308",Hey.
1260,"01:15:23,936","01:15:26,604",What happened back there?
1261,"01:15:26,772","01:15:28,981",I was trying to be one of the tribe.
1262,"01:15:29,149","01:15:32,318","But I guess I'm never gonna be
""the bird"" like your dad wants me to be."
1263,"01:15:32,486","01:15:35,655","- What?
- I think it's time to go home."
1264,"01:15:35,822","01:15:37,573",We should talk about this.
1265,"01:15:37,741","01:15:39,283",Talk about what?
1266,"01:15:39,451","01:15:40,785","Blu, look around."
1267,"01:15:40,953","01:15:45,456","The kids are thriving.
They love being in the wild."
1268,"01:15:46,291","01:15:48,125",Maybe this place is home.
1269,"01:15:48,293","01:15:50,586",Home? How could this be home?
1270,"01:15:50,754","01:15:52,874","I have done everything I can
to fit in and help out..."
1271,"01:15:52,965","01:15:54,507","but no matter what I do, it's wrong."
1272,"01:15:54,675","01:15:56,133","That's not home, Jewel."
1273,"01:15:56,301","01:15:59,136","Maybe for you, but not for me."
1274,"01:15:59,304","01:16:02,139","You know what?
You need to figure out what you want."
1275,"01:16:02,307","01:16:07,311","And maybe, stop thinking about just
yourself and start thinking about us."
1276,"01:16:45,517","01:16:46,684","Hey, you heard the boss."
1277,"01:16:46,852","01:16:48,311",Move out! Let's go!
1278,"01:16:53,984","01:16:55,735",Beautiful.
1279,"01:17:11,335","01:17:13,878",Linda! Tulio!
1280,"01:17:22,346","01:17:24,221","Goodbye, Linda."
1281,"01:17:29,853","01:17:31,395","Goodbye, fanny pack."
1282,"01:17:31,563","01:17:33,731",Turn around when possible.
1283,"01:17:33,899","01:17:37,735","Sorry, GPS lady. It's not you. It's me."
1284,"01:17:38,236","01:17:41,906","Goodbye, pancakes. Goodbye, coffee."
1285,"01:17:43,158","01:17:45,326","Goodbye, coffee."
1286,"01:17:49,081","01:17:50,581",Linda?
1287,"01:17:51,750","01:17:52,750",Linda!
1288,"01:17:57,964","01:17:59,006",Eduardo was right!
1289,"01:17:59,174","01:18:00,735","- Traitor!
- Wait, you don't understand."
1290,"01:18:00,842","01:18:03,094","What don't I understand?
Siding with humans?"
1291,"01:18:03,261","01:18:04,661",What do you even know about humans?
1292,"01:18:05,180","01:18:08,766","I know everything.
They lure you in, they trap you."
1293,"01:18:08,934","01:18:10,601",They destroy your mind!
1294,"01:18:10,769","01:18:12,686","Polly want a cracker?
Polly want a cracker?"
1295,"01:18:12,854","01:18:14,688",No! Enough crackers!
1296,"01:18:14,856","01:18:16,357",I hate crackers!
1297,"01:18:20,278","01:18:21,278","Come on, Roberto!"
1298,"01:18:21,321","01:18:22,613",It's them. It's them!
1299,"01:18:22,697","01:18:23,781",It's them!
1300,"01:18:24,783","01:18:25,783","Roberto, get out of..."
1301,"01:18:29,121","01:18:31,789","Not again! Not again!
No more crackers!"
1302,"01:18:32,624","01:18:33,624",Snap out of it!
1303,"01:18:34,603","01:18:35,603",Look...
1304,"01:18:35,627","01:18:37,228","we've got one chance to stop this, okay?"
1305,"01:18:37,379","01:18:38,295",I have to find my friends.
1306,"01:18:38,380","01:18:40,214","You fly back and warn the others.
You got it?"
1307,"01:18:40,382","01:18:41,465",Yeah. I got it.
1308,"01:18:41,633","01:18:42,967","- Okay. Go!
- Okay!"
1309,"01:18:46,138","01:18:48,472","Humans, humans!"
1310,"01:18:52,310","01:18:53,811","- Your left! Your right!
- My left?"
1311,"01:18:53,979","01:18:55,312",Left or right?
1312,"01:18:58,233","01:19:00,067","- Your right leg, my left leg.
- Okay."
1313,"01:19:00,235","01:19:02,319",Good! Good! Good!
1314,"01:19:02,487","01:19:04,321","- Now, go up.
- Go up."
1315,"01:19:05,991","01:19:06,991",Reach!
1316,"01:19:06,992","01:19:08,367",Almost there!
1317,"01:19:10,996","01:19:11,996",Linda...
1318,"01:19:12,497","01:19:13,998",I'm so sorry.
1319,"01:19:14,166","01:19:15,958",As bad as this is...
1320,"01:19:16,126","01:19:20,671","there is no place I would rather be
in the whole world than with you."
1321,"01:19:20,839","01:19:23,340",Even if it is tied to a tree.
1322,"01:19:29,514","01:19:30,848",Linda!
1323,"01:19:32,350","01:19:33,350",Blu!
1324,"01:19:33,643","01:19:34,643",Blu!
1325,"01:19:34,811","01:19:36,145","- Linda?
- Down here!"
1326,"01:19:37,981","01:19:39,356",What? Blu!
1327,"01:19:39,524","01:19:42,193","What are you doing here?
This is dangerous!"
1328,"01:19:42,360","01:19:44,862","That's incredible!
It's a 2,000-mile flight!"
1329,"01:19:45,030","01:19:46,391","- Let's follow him!
- It's amazing!"
1330,"01:19:47,824","01:19:49,658",I told you I heard him.
1331,"01:20:06,218","01:20:07,760",I'll take those.
1332,"01:20:39,918","01:20:41,669","Game over!
It's over!"
1333,"01:20:41,836","01:20:43,921",Humans! The lights!
1334,"01:20:45,048","01:20:46,340",It's over!
1335,"01:20:46,508","01:20:48,509","He's been blabbering like this
since we found him."
1336,"01:20:48,677","01:20:50,719","The loggers are coming!
And Blu is with them!"
1337,"01:20:50,887","01:20:51,887","- Traitor!
- No!"
1338,"01:20:52,013","01:20:53,430","No, Blu is trying to help us."
1339,"01:20:53,598","01:20:54,848",What? By himself?
1340,"01:20:55,016","01:20:56,600",Let's evacuate! We're leaving.
1341,"01:20:56,768","01:20:57,935",Let's go. Everyone move out.
1342,"01:20:58,103","01:20:59,270","- Go, go, go!
- Dad?"
1343,"01:20:59,437","01:21:01,230","No, not this time.
I'm not going with you."
1344,"01:21:01,398","01:21:04,191","You have to go with me!
I will not put my family in danger again."
1345,"01:21:04,359","01:21:07,027","Blu is my family,
and I'm not leaving him behind."
1346,"01:21:07,195","01:21:08,946",You don't have to.
1347,"01:21:11,199","01:21:12,783",Are you okay?
1348,"01:21:14,786","01:21:18,205","Look, Eduardo, I might not be
the birdliest bird in the flock..."
1349,"01:21:18,373","01:21:20,291","but, for once,
that's actually a good thing."
1350,"01:21:20,625","01:21:21,792",You know the jungle...
1351,"01:21:21,960","01:21:23,460",I know humans.
1352,"01:21:23,628","01:21:25,713","And I know that, together,
we can stop them."
1353,"01:21:26,423","01:21:28,465",We can't let them take our home.
1354,"01:21:28,633","01:21:31,719","Sure, it's hot and loud
and filled with creepy bugs..."
1355,"01:21:31,970","01:21:33,429",but it's ours.
1356,"01:21:33,597","01:21:35,806",Let's fight for it. Who's with me?
1357,"01:21:35,974","01:21:37,266",I'm with you!
1358,"01:21:39,603","01:21:40,644",Anybody else?
1359,"01:21:49,112","01:21:50,821",Stop! Stop!
1360,"01:21:52,449","01:21:53,824",Stop!
1361,"01:21:57,162","01:22:00,164",Stop!
1362,"01:22:06,129","01:22:09,089",Yeah. Respect the rainforest!
1363,"01:22:25,440","01:22:27,900",I knew it! I knew it!
1364,"01:22:31,863","01:22:34,156",Hey. Where do you think you're going?
1365,"01:22:34,324","01:22:37,201",It's just a bunch of pigeons.
1366,"01:22:37,369","01:22:38,827",Get back to work!
1367,"01:22:42,666","01:22:44,249","Lead the way, Blu."
1368,"01:22:44,417","01:22:46,293",That's my name! Yes! You called me Blu.
1369,"01:22:46,461","01:22:48,128","Yes, I am Blu!"
1370,"01:22:48,296","01:22:50,214",What? Right.
1371,"01:22:50,382","01:22:51,840",Birds of blue feathers...
1372,"01:22:52,008","01:22:54,093",Have to stick together!
1373,"01:23:06,189","01:23:08,899",Everybody ready? And under!
1374,"01:23:11,486","01:23:12,486",Over!
1375,"01:23:15,573","01:23:16,573",Backwards!
1376,"01:23:22,038","01:23:25,666",I will survive I will survive
1377,"01:23:29,254","01:23:31,463","- Got him!
- Wow, precise."
1378,"01:23:32,090","01:23:34,800",I ain't afraid of no birds.
1379,"01:23:38,388","01:23:40,055",Attack!
1380,"01:23:40,223","01:23:41,807",It's on in the Amazon.
1381,"01:23:41,975","01:23:43,726","All right, hit it!"
1382,"01:23:46,396","01:23:47,604",High-five!
1383,"01:23:53,194","01:23:55,070",Why? Why?
1384,"01:23:55,238","01:23:56,613",Get a grip!
1385,"01:24:00,660","01:24:02,536",Incoming!
1386,"01:24:06,374","01:24:07,916",Halt!
1387,"01:24:09,002","01:24:10,377",There he is.
1388,"01:24:10,545","01:24:13,464","Charlie, prepare the nose-zooka."
1389,"01:24:14,215","01:24:15,340",Tiago!
1390,"01:24:15,508","01:24:16,925",Now we're talking.
1391,"01:24:17,093","01:24:18,093",Ready...
1392,"01:24:18,136","01:24:19,219",aim...
1393,"01:24:19,387","01:24:20,387",fire!
1394,"01:24:24,392","01:24:26,101",Foiled again.
1395,"01:24:27,979","01:24:30,147","- Good job, Tiago.
- We're a great team, Dad!"
1396,"01:24:30,315","01:24:31,774","- Hey, old Eddie.
- Felipe."
1397,"01:24:31,941","01:24:34,902","You think I would miss this party?
Game on!"
1398,"01:24:39,157","01:24:40,824",Hey! Come back!
1399,"01:24:41,075","01:24:42,993","You're useless, all of you!"
1400,"01:24:43,620","01:24:44,620",Look out!
1401,"01:24:48,666","01:24:51,335",Pick on someone your own size.
1402,"01:24:59,177","01:25:00,177",No! No!
1403,"01:25:00,303","01:25:04,807","I got you, I got you.
It's okay, you're safe now."
1404,"01:25:11,523","01:25:13,524",That's a Linda.
1405,"01:25:20,281","01:25:21,281",Yeah!
1406,"01:25:24,786","01:25:26,578","We still got it, Blu!"
1407,"01:25:36,631","01:25:39,550",I have to do everything myself.
1408,"01:25:44,472","01:25:46,139",Hey! Get away from that!
1409,"01:25:46,307","01:25:49,226",No! No one steals my scene.
1410,"01:25:55,358","01:25:56,900",Lollipop?
1411,"01:26:03,241","01:26:04,241",What?
1412,"01:26:06,035","01:26:07,619",What are you doing? Let go!
1413,"01:26:07,787","01:26:08,787",Save yourself!
1414,"01:26:10,748","01:26:11,915","Come on, let go!"
1415,"01:26:12,208","01:26:14,084","- Never!
- Are you crazy?"
1416,"01:26:14,252","01:26:16,044",You'll bring both of us down! Let go!
1417,"01:26:17,589","01:26:18,589",Fly!
1418,"01:26:19,215","01:26:20,799","Déjà vu, Blu."
1419,"01:26:20,967","01:26:21,967",Nigel!
1420,"01:26:23,469","01:26:24,469",Blu!

1422,"01:26:49,621","01:26:50,621",You.
1423,"01:26:51,581","01:26:55,834","You will pay a painful price
for your pestilence!"
1424,"01:26:56,002","01:26:57,794","Hey, stop that! Get off of me!"
1425,"01:26:57,962","01:27:00,464","A flurry of furious feathers
in your face!"
1426,"01:27:00,632","01:27:02,174",You don't have to do this!
1427,"01:27:02,342","01:27:04,426","No, I just want to."
1428,"01:27:04,594","01:27:05,636","Hey, stop! Stop!"
1429,"01:27:05,803","01:27:08,639","Oh, my goodness. Charlie!
This is it. This is it!"
1430,"01:27:08,806","01:27:10,599",Steady. Steady.
1431,"01:27:10,767","01:27:12,017",Slap fight!
1432,"01:27:14,938","01:27:16,146",Shoot! Shoot!
1433,"01:27:24,822","01:27:25,822",Nigel!
1434,"01:27:37,835","01:27:39,878",Is this the end?
1435,"01:27:40,046","01:27:41,505",I was too young...
1436,"01:27:41,673","01:27:44,383",too beautiful to live.
1437,"01:27:47,845","01:27:50,013","- Bob?
- Hold up! That ain't Bob!"
1438,"01:27:50,181","01:27:52,057",I told you I knew him from somewhere.
1439,"01:27:52,225","01:27:54,267",My final curtain call.
1440,"01:27:55,019","01:27:57,688",And it's standing room only.
1441,"01:27:58,731","01:28:00,357",Goodbye.
1442,"01:28:15,206","01:28:16,456",No!
1443,"01:28:16,624","01:28:18,458",No! What have I done?
1444,"01:28:18,626","01:28:20,544",If I cannot liveth with thee...
1445,"01:28:20,712","01:28:23,380",then I shall not liveth at all.
1446,"01:28:47,238","01:28:48,989",That frog is not poisonous.
1447,"01:28:49,157","01:28:50,407",What?
1448,"01:28:50,575","01:28:51,825",We're not dead?
1449,"01:28:51,993","01:28:55,162","It's a very common mistake.
But she's a harmless pseudo-dendrobates."
1450,"01:28:55,329","01:28:56,788",You can tell by the pink spots.
1451,"01:28:56,956","01:29:01,084","But my parents always told me I was
poisonous and shouldn't touch anyone."
1452,"01:29:01,502","01:29:03,587",You just had really mean parents.
1453,"01:29:03,921","01:29:05,255","Oh, wow."
1454,"01:29:05,423","01:29:06,757","So, now..."
1455,"01:29:07,633","01:29:09,009",we can be together!
1456,"01:29:14,599","01:29:17,851","- Nigel! Nigel-Wigel-Wigglepuss!
- No!"
1457,"01:29:18,019","01:29:20,937","- Somebody, help me!
- I'm going to never let you go."
1458,"01:29:21,105","01:29:22,773","- I'm sorry, I'll be nicer. No!
- Never gonna let you go!"
1459,"01:29:22,940","01:29:24,191","No, Charlie!"
1460,"01:29:24,776","01:29:26,777",Charlie!
1461,"01:29:27,695","01:29:29,988",This is unnatural!
1462,"01:29:43,795","01:29:45,629","Hey, guys! Hi!"
1463,"01:29:46,756","01:29:48,465","There's nothing in my hair, right? Okay."
1464,"01:29:49,008","01:29:51,343","Directly from the heart of the
Amazon rainforest..."
1465,"01:29:51,511","01:29:53,220",we have some breaking news.
1466,"01:29:53,387","01:29:55,347",Thanks to Dr. Monteiro and his team...
1467,"01:29:55,515","01:30:00,018","the entire area will be designated
as a National Wildlife Refuge."
1468,"01:30:00,186","01:30:03,188","And together,
we'll make sure this place stays safe."
1469,"01:30:03,356","01:30:04,356","Right, Blu?"
1470,"01:30:05,817","01:30:07,901",But that's not the only good news.
1471,"01:30:08,069","01:30:10,195","We found this cockatoo
deep in the Amazon..."
1472,"01:30:10,363","01:30:12,906","and he seems to have bonded
with a tree frog."
1473,"01:30:13,074","01:30:16,993","We are bringing them back to Rio
for continuing observation."
1474,"01:30:18,079","01:30:21,540","Oh, Nigel! Wow!
A honeymoon in Rio!"
