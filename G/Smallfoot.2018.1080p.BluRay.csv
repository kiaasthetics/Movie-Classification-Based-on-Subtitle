1,"00:00:29,821","00:00:32,278",This is my world.
2,"00:00:32,741","00:00:35,904","Harsh, jagged, freezing."
3,"00:00:36,370","00:00:38,201","And I gotta say,"
4,"00:00:38,330","00:00:39,695",it's awesome!
5,"00:00:39,790","00:00:41,576",It's got everything.
6,"00:00:41,750","00:00:44,457","Ice, rocks, ice, snow, ice.
It's got a lot of ice."
7,"00:00:44,670","00:00:45,830",Plenty of modern amenities.
8,"00:00:46,004","00:00:48,290","And the best part, everyone's happy."
9,"00:00:48,382","00:00:52,000","That's because our world
is built on a foundation of stones."
10,"00:00:52,094","00:00:53,880",Not those. These.
11,"00:00:54,096","00:00:56,337","See, we have these laws
that are written in stone."
12,"00:00:56,682","00:00:59,048","Literally, written in stone!"
13,"00:00:59,142","00:01:02,100","Interpreted and enforced
by the Stonekeeper."
14,"00:01:02,187","00:01:05,771","The stones are here to protect us
and keep us safe."
15,"00:01:05,941","00:01:08,307","They pretty much tell us
everything that we need to know."
16,"00:01:08,485","00:01:10,476","Important stuff,
like how the world was created"
17,"00:01:10,571","00:01:13,779","when we all fell
from the butt of the great sky yak"
18,"00:01:15,033","00:01:17,024",and how our world is an island
19,"00:01:17,119","00:01:19,576","that floats on a sea of endless clouds,"
20,"00:01:19,663","00:01:22,871","resting on the backs
of the great mountain mammoths."
21,"00:01:23,000","00:01:25,958","And how we have to feed ice
to the mammoths, so they don't overheat"
22,"00:01:26,044","00:01:27,705","'cause if they did, they would die,"
23,"00:01:27,796","00:01:30,458","and we would all fall
into the great nothing."
24,"00:01:30,549","00:01:32,335",There's nothing down here!
25,"00:01:32,509","00:01:34,090",But my favorite stone of all
26,"00:01:34,177","00:01:36,384","is the one that says
the gong must be rung"
27,"00:01:36,471","00:01:38,837",to wake the great glowing snail
28,"00:01:38,932","00:01:42,470","so it can crawl across the sky
and bring light to the village."
29,"00:01:43,186","00:01:44,596",I love that one.
30,"00:01:44,813","00:01:47,145","It might be the most important job
ofaM"
31,"00:01:47,733","00:01:51,351","And, humble brag,
that job belongs to my dad."
32,"00:01:54,865","00:01:57,106","He does it with passion, commitment"
33,"00:01:57,743","00:01:59,279","and the help
of his able-bodied assistant..."
34,"00:01:59,453","00:02:02,160","Up and at them, Migo!
Time to ring the gong."
35,"00:02:02,247","00:02:03,157",...me.
36,"00:02:03,248","00:02:04,533",Yes!
37,"00:02:04,708","00:02:06,699","I guess you could say
I'm learning the ropes"
38,"00:02:07,461","00:02:08,325",and the wheel
39,"00:02:10,964","00:02:11,999",and the crank
40,"00:02:13,300","00:02:16,258","because if my dad didn't ring the gong,
we 'd all be in the dark."
41,"00:02:16,345","00:02:17,425",Launch!
42,"00:02:19,473","00:02:20,838",It isn't easy.
43,"00:02:20,932","00:02:23,719","It requires skill, rock-solid nerves,"
44,"00:02:23,894","00:02:25,725","and a good,
strong head on your shoulders..."
45,"00:02:27,105","00:02:29,061","...because there '3 literally
no other way to ring a gong."
46,"00:02:30,275","00:02:31,264","Oh, yeah."
47,"00:02:31,360","00:02:33,442","It gives my dad
a great sense of purpose."
48,"00:02:34,446","00:02:36,812","Like I said, it's an important job,"
49,"00:02:36,907","00:02:38,989",a job that'll one day be mine.
50,"00:02:40,619","00:02:42,484","Whoo-hoo! Good one, Dad!"
51,"00:02:42,663","00:02:43,994",And I can't wait for the day
52,"00:02:44,164","00:02:46,655","that it's me
who gets to wake the village."
53,"00:02:46,750","00:02:49,162",Look at everybody there below
54,"00:02:49,252","00:02:51,664",All the yetis that I love and know
55,"00:02:51,838","00:02:55,831","And they're waking up to see
This awesome morning"
56,"00:02:57,177","00:03:02,217","They've all got a smile on their face
Another reason I love this place"
57,"00:03:02,683","00:03:06,096","'Cause it's always full of life
And never boring"
58,"00:03:06,353","00:03:07,843",Ah.
59,"00:03:08,480","00:03:10,391",Look all around us
60,"00:03:10,565","00:03:13,147",It's all rock and ice and snow
61,"00:03:13,318","00:03:15,024",Frigid and freezing
62,"00:03:15,112","00:03:16,977","Yeah, it's pretty great, I know"
63,"00:03:17,072","00:03:20,439","And hey, hey
It's another day"
64,"00:03:20,534","00:03:22,399",Like every other
65,"00:03:22,494","00:03:24,735",I don't wanna change a thing
66,"00:03:24,830","00:03:26,320",Not one little thing
67,"00:03:26,415","00:03:29,703","Imean, because I do
What the stones say"
68,"00:03:29,793","00:03:31,784",And I'm doing okay
69,"00:03:31,962","00:03:35,750","What could be better than this?
It is what it is"
70,"00:03:35,924","00:03:38,290",It is perfection
71,"00:03:44,433","00:03:49,644","Look at everybody do their part
And they do it with a happy heart"
72,"00:03:49,813","00:03:53,931","And it gives them all
A sense of greater purpose"
73,"00:03:54,109","00:03:59,570","Well, that's the way that I wanna be
I wanna make them all proud of me"
74,"00:03:59,740","00:04:03,278","Just be a steady yeti
At their service"
75,"00:04:03,452","00:04:06,194","Do you seriously believe mammoths
are holding us up?"
76,"00:04:06,288","00:04:08,244","Mmm-hmm.
- What's holding up the mammoths?"
77,"00:04:08,373","00:04:10,614","Uh, hello. lt'sjust mammoths
all the way down."
78,"00:04:10,834","00:04:13,075","Don't listen to them.
They're questioning the stones."
79,"00:04:13,253","00:04:14,368",And we don't do that. Okay?
80,"00:04:14,546","00:04:19,085","If there's a question
Causing you to go astray"
81,"00:04:19,259","00:04:23,002","Just stuff it down inside
Until it goes away"
82,"00:04:23,180","00:04:24,670","- Got it?
- Where's Migo?"
83,"00:04:25,932","00:04:27,468","Migo, you will never be
the gong ringer..."
84,"00:04:27,642","00:04:28,472","Wait, what?"
85,"00:04:28,643","00:04:29,974",...if you don't practice.

87,"00:04:31,646","00:04:34,103","Oh, I blew the surprise! Sorry, Dad."
88,"00:04:34,274","00:04:36,390",My own helmet? You mean today's the day?
89,"00:04:36,568","00:04:37,853","Congratulations, Migo."
90,"00:04:38,737","00:04:40,102","Big day, son!"
91,"00:04:40,280","00:04:42,362","Hey, everyone,

196,"00:09:42,123","00:09:43,078","- What?
- Ow!"
197,"00:09:44,292","00:09:46,203","Just come here and see for yourself!
Let's go! Come on!"
198,"00:09:46,377","00:09:47,708","Everyone, let's go!"
199,"00:09:50,715","00:09:52,205","- Hmm?
- Mmm-hmm."
200,"00:09:52,675","00:09:54,290",He'S crazy!
201,"00:09:54,511","00:09:56,001",Dad!
202,"00:10:16,074","00:10:17,439",It came at me from the Sky.
203,"00:10:17,534","00:10:19,866","It was like some sort
of hard, Shiny flying thing!"
204,"00:10:19,953","00:10:22,319",It made a sound like...
205,"00:10:22,413","00:10:23,823",And that's when it scooped me up!
206,"00:10:23,915","00:10:25,246",Look. It's right this way.
207,"00:10:26,751","00:10:29,367",Aahl
208,"00:10:29,629","00:10:31,244",No! But...
209,"00:10:31,714","00:10:32,829",Uh...
210,"00:10:33,258","00:10:35,465","No! No, no! No!"
211,"00:10:37,178","00:10:39,294",It was right here!
212,"00:10:39,848","00:10:42,055","I swear! This shiny, flying thing."
213,"00:10:42,225","00:10:43,931",That's what the smallfoot Shot out of.
214,"00:10:44,060","00:10:45,300","It was like, poof!"
215,"00:10:45,478","00:10:48,470","And then this big Skin thing landed
on top of it. It was like..."
216,"00:10:48,606","00:10:49,345",Ooh.
217,"00:10:49,482","00:10:52,724","And then it saw me, and it sang
the most strange, beautiful song."
218,"00:10:52,902","00:10:54,688",It was like...
219,"00:10:54,863","00:10:56,524","Almost, it was more like..."
220,"00:10:57,866","00:10:59,231","Oh, it's probably
still around here somewhere."
221,"00:10:59,325","00:11:00,485","Let's look for it. Come on, everyone!"
222,"00:11:00,660","00:11:01,399",Still around here?
223,"00:11:01,578","00:11:03,489","- It could be in the village!
- It could be at my house!"
224,"00:11:03,663","00:11:04,903",Get the Children!
225,"00:11:05,081","00:11:06,662",Migo'S gone crazy!
226,"00:11:06,833","00:11:08,994","- He said he saw a smallfoot!
- Is that possible?"
227,"00:11:09,169","00:11:10,158","Oh, there you are!"
228,"00:11:10,336","00:11:12,327","- IS it real?
- Wait! Hold on! Everyone!"
229,"00:11:12,505","00:11:15,042","It didn't seem all that scary!
It was kind of cute!"
230,"00:11:17,510","00:11:20,343","Everyone, make way for my dad!"
231,"00:11:20,513","00:11:22,469","Uh, I mean, the Stonekeeper. Sorry, Dad."
232,"00:11:22,557","00:11:24,718","I mean, Stonekeeper.
Come on, Thorp. You blew it."
233,"00:11:24,851","00:11:26,512","Good morning, everyone!
Hey, how are you?"
234,"00:11:26,686","00:11:29,223","- Oh, boy.
- Is this about Migo missing the gong?"
235,"00:11:29,314","00:11:31,179","Stonekeeper, he saw a smallfoot!"
236,"00:11:31,274","00:11:33,230","- He said it might still be out there!
- He said it fell from the sky!"
237,"00:11:33,318","00:11:35,980","Garry, calm down. You know how you get."
238,"00:11:36,154","00:11:37,485","Okay, I'll try, but I'm just so scared."
239,"00:11:37,655","00:11:41,864","Now, I know Migo has gotten you all
very anxious with his little ""story,"""
240,"00:11:42,035","00:11:45,118","but there's nothing to fear
because it isn't true."
241,"00:11:45,788","00:11:47,153",But I saw one!
242,"00:11:47,332","00:11:48,663","No, you didn't."
243,"00:11:48,791","00:11:49,701",I did.
244,"00:11:49,876","00:11:51,832","You can't have seen it
because it doesn't exist."
245,"00:11:52,003","00:11:54,494","I know. I know. Because the stone says
there's no such thing as a smallfoot."
246,"00:11:54,589","00:11:57,080","Yeah, right there, Clear as day."
247,"00:11:57,675","00:12:00,917","I know,
but it was right there in front Of me!"
248,"00:12:01,054","00:12:02,544","Hey, Migo!"
249,"00:12:02,639","00:12:04,425",How do you know it was a smallfoot?
250,"00:12:04,515","00:12:06,847",Because it had a small foot.
251,"00:12:07,060","00:12:08,550","Uh, Dad?"
252,"00:12:08,853","00:12:11,765","Daddy, clearly, he saw something."
253,"00:12:11,940","00:12:14,272","Oh, I'm not denying he saw something."
254,"00:12:14,442","00:12:19,061","Most likely, he Slipped, hit his head,
got confused, and saw a yak."
255,"00:12:19,405","00:12:21,566","Okay, I get it now."
256,"00:12:21,741","00:12:24,528","Because if Migo iS saying
he saw a smallfoot,"
257,"00:12:24,619","00:12:26,484",then he's saying a stone is wrong.
258,"00:12:26,955","00:12:27,990",Uh...
259,"00:12:28,164","00:12:31,531","Is that what you're saying, Migo?
That a stone is wrong?"
260,"00:12:31,626","00:12:33,617",Nope! He is not saying that!
261,"00:12:33,795","00:12:36,411","Let me talk to him.
Kids, right?"
262,"00:12:36,589","00:12:37,829","Migo, what are you doing?"
263,"00:12:37,924","00:12:40,586","Challenging the Stonekeeper
in front of the whole village?"
264,"00:12:40,677","00:12:42,963","Dad, what's the piece Of advice
you're always giving me?"
265,"00:12:43,137","00:12:44,126","""Do what you're told."""
266,"00:12:44,305","00:12:45,715","- The other one.
- ""Blend in."""
267,"00:12:45,890","00:12:46,675",The other one.
268,"00:12:46,849","00:12:48,385","""Follow the stones."" ""Be a cog."""
269,"00:12:48,476","00:12:50,637","""DO your part.""
""Never disagree with the Stonekeeper."""
270,"00:12:50,812","00:12:51,927","""Always be true!"""
271,"00:12:52,105","00:12:55,017","That was about hitting a gong.
Not challenging a stone."
272,"00:12:55,108","00:12:57,941","'Cause if it goes against a stone,
it can't be true!"
273,"00:12:58,111","00:13:00,397","But if I say I didn't see a smallfoot,"
274,"00:13:00,571","00:13:01,856",then I'm lying.
275,"00:13:01,948","00:13:02,983","Migo,"
276,"00:13:03,157","00:13:05,648","I thought you wanted
to be the next gong ringer."
277,"00:13:05,827","00:13:06,486",I do.
278,"00:13:06,661","00:13:08,617","Then are you still saying
a stone is wrong?"
279,"00:13:08,788","00:13:14,283","If saying I saw a smallfoot means that
a stone is wrong, then I guess I am."
280,"00:13:15,670","00:13:16,659",Oh!
281,"00:13:21,175","00:13:22,631","Oh, Migo."
282,"00:13:23,553","00:13:26,920",It pains me to say this. It truly does.
283,"00:13:27,223","00:13:29,214",But you leave me no Choice.
284,"00:13:31,102","00:13:34,265","Disobeying the stones
is a grave offense."
285,"00:13:34,439","00:13:37,351","From this day fonNard,
you will be banished from the village!"
286,"00:13:38,526","00:13:39,891","- What?
- Until you are ready"
287,"00:13:40,069","00:13:41,775",to stand before us all
288,"00:13:41,863","00:13:43,148",and tell us the truth.
289,"00:13:43,323","00:13:45,530",I am telling the truth.
290,"00:13:46,200","00:13:48,532","That's all, everyone. Back to work."
291,"00:13:48,703","00:13:51,240",Let's make it another perfect day.
292,"00:13:52,540","00:13:54,371","Stonekeeper, please."
293,"00:13:54,542","00:13:55,702",That's my son.
294,"00:13:55,877","00:13:58,459","Just give him a little time
alone out there tO think."
295,"00:13:58,629","00:14:00,244",He'll come to his senses.
296,"00:14:12,560","00:14:13,891","- Sooze.
- Hey!"
297,"00:14:14,520","00:14:16,260","You're banished, remember?"
298,"00:14:16,439","00:14:18,054","- You know what that means.
- Yes, Thorp."
299,"00:14:18,232","00:14:19,813",You do? What does it mean?
300,"00:14:19,984","00:14:21,315","- Thorp!
- Coming!"
301,"00:14:21,402","00:14:22,357",We'll circle back.

brutal environment of the Himalayas,"
303,"00:15:00,400","00:15:03,312","but this ingenious creature
defies the odds."

308,"00:15:18,167","00:15:20,829","There's an element
of mental preparation, I'm sure."

310,"00:15:27,844","00:15:29,630",The venom! It's going to my brain!
311,"00:15:29,720","00:15:30,960",I can't feel my face.

381,"00:18:30,443","00:18:31,683",What?
382,"00:18:31,861","00:18:34,352","What is this place, exactly?"
383,"00:18:34,447","00:18:37,530",The secret headquarters of the S.E.S.
384,"00:18:37,700","00:18:38,985",The Esias?
385,"00:18:39,160","00:18:41,867","NO, no, no. It's three letters.
Like S-E-S."
386,"00:18:42,038","00:18:44,324","Stands for ""Smallfoot Exists, Suckas!"""
387,"00:18:44,415","00:18:47,498","Fleem,
it's ""Smallfoot Evidentiary Society."""
388,"00:18:47,668","00:18:49,750","I mean, my name's
got a lot more pizzazz, but..."
389,"00:18:49,837","00:18:51,793","Wait. You're, like, a smallfoot club?"
390,"00:18:52,256","00:18:53,996",And hold on. You're the leader?
391,"00:18:54,467","00:18:56,082",But you're the Stonekeeper's daughter.
392,"00:18:56,177","00:18:57,417","Look, I love my father,"
393,"00:18:57,511","00:19:00,127","but he isn't exactly what you would call
""open to new ideas."""
394,"00:19:00,222","00:19:02,634",Because questions lead to knowledge.
395,"00:19:02,725","00:19:04,556",And knowledge is power.
396,"00:19:04,644","00:19:07,135","SO you don't just believe
in the smallfoot."
397,"00:19:07,229","00:19:09,015",You've been looking for one.
398,"00:19:09,106","00:19:10,937",Yes. You see all the X's?
399,"00:19:11,025","00:19:14,188","We have searched the entire mountain
for years trying to find one."
400,"00:19:14,362","00:19:15,602",Why are you looking for X's?
401,"00:19:15,780","00:19:18,613","We're not looking for X's.
We're looking for the smallfoot."
402,"00:19:18,699","00:19:19,984",And you have seen one.
403,"00:19:20,159","00:19:21,695",But I can't prove it.
404,"00:19:21,869","00:19:23,405",That iS where we come in.
405,"00:19:23,579","00:19:25,570","Gwangi, Show him the evidence."
406,"00:19:26,832","00:19:27,867",Here's your proof.
407,"00:19:31,545","00:19:33,581","First item, smallfoot pelt."
408,"00:19:33,714","00:19:36,000","Evidence suggests
it sheds its skin annually."
409,"00:19:36,092","00:19:39,801","Second item, smallfoot horn.
We believe it only has one."
410,"00:19:40,262","00:19:42,674",And then there's this.
411,"00:19:43,432","00:19:45,593",The scroll of invisible wisdom.
412,"00:19:45,810","00:19:48,973","Just imagine the amazing stuff
they put on here."
413,"00:19:49,146","00:19:50,727","A bunch of crap, if you ask me."
414,"00:19:50,856","00:19:52,812",This proves nothing!
415,"00:19:52,942","00:19:54,102",Show him the last one.
416,"00:19:54,276","00:19:57,734","It's the first piece I ever found.
It's the thing that started all Of this."
417,"00:19:57,863","00:19:59,854",That was a trigger. He's triggered!
418,"00:19:59,990","00:20:01,105",Mmm-hmm.
419,"00:20:02,284","00:20:04,400",Look at your small foot.
420,"00:20:04,578","00:20:06,114","- You did see one.
- Where did it go?"
421,"00:20:06,288","00:20:07,323","- I don't know!
- Think!"
422,"00:20:07,415","00:20:08,279","- Reach into your memory!
- Slap him!"
423,"00:20:08,457","00:20:11,324","NO! It got whisked away on the wind,
over the Clouds!"
424,"00:20:11,502","00:20:13,584","Which way? Up?
Sideways? Where?"
425,"00:20:15,423","00:20:16,253",Down!
426,"00:20:16,424","00:20:18,289",Did you say down?
427,"00:20:18,384","00:20:19,624","- Slap him!
- Fleem!"
428,"00:20:19,719","00:20:21,255",Down! Of course!
429,"00:20:21,429","00:20:23,966","You know, I have always thought
it was weird that a mountain floats"
430,"00:20:24,056","00:20:27,139","when there's Obviously some
invisible force pulling us downward"
431,"00:20:27,226","00:20:29,808","and keeping everything around us
from drifting Off into the sky."
432,"00:20:31,355","00:20:32,640","Of course, this is just a theory."
433,"00:20:32,815","00:20:34,851","But that's why
we haven't found one up here."
434,"00:20:35,609","00:20:38,100","Because it's down here,"
435,"00:20:38,237","00:20:40,273",below the Clouds.
436,"00:20:40,698","00:20:43,940","And if you want proof,
that's where we need to go."
437,"00:20:44,618","00:20:47,075",In the nothing?
438,"00:20:48,831","00:20:50,412",You're crazy.
439,"00:20:50,541","00:20:51,656",Don't call me crazy.
440,"00:20:51,751","00:20:53,207",Yeah. Never call a crazy guy crazy.
441,"00:20:53,294","00:20:54,750","You want to know
why it's called the nothing?"
442,"00:20:54,837","00:20:56,498",Because there's nothing down there!
443,"00:20:56,672","00:20:57,832",Why do you believe that?
444,"00:20:58,007","00:20:59,372",Because it's in the stones.
445,"00:20:59,550","00:21:01,632","SO is the one that says
there's no smallfoot."
446,"00:21:01,719","00:21:02,799",And yet you saw one.
447,"00:21:02,887","00:21:05,378","Yeah. Why is there a stone
that says something doesn't exist?"
448,"00:21:05,473","00:21:07,384","Doesn't that just prove
that it actually does?"
449,"00:21:07,475","00:21:10,638","And if one stone is wrong,
then others could be as well."
450,"00:21:10,811","00:21:14,053","What? Other stones?
How many do you think are wrong?"
451,"00:21:14,231","00:21:15,641",The whole robe.
452,"00:21:15,816","00:21:16,646",Huh.
453,"00:21:16,734","00:21:18,690","You know what?
This whole thing's insane. I'm out."
454,"00:21:19,820","00:21:21,026","Migo, wait."
455,"00:21:21,197","00:21:23,028","Hey, I just wanna prove
that I saw a smallfoot"
456,"00:21:23,115","00:21:24,400",so I can get un-banished.
457,"00:21:24,492","00:21:26,232","But you, you wanna, what,"
458,"00:21:26,327","00:21:28,067","tear down everything
our world is built on?"
459,"00:21:28,245","00:21:31,533","It's not just about
tearing down Old ideas."
460,"00:21:31,749","00:21:33,785",It's about finding new ones.
461,"00:21:34,919","00:21:36,034",You know what? Come with me.
462,"00:21:44,303","00:21:48,546","Take a look around
And see the world we think we know"
463,"00:21:48,641","00:21:52,634",And then look closer
464,"00:21:52,728","00:21:53,592",Wow.

468,"00:22:09,537","00:22:12,028",So let it all unfold

497,"00:24:33,472","00:24:35,383","- Really?
- DO you have a plan?"
498,"00:24:35,557","00:24:37,093","Of course, we have a plan."
499,"00:24:37,476","00:24:39,341","Uh, I think the plan
might need more planning."
500,"00:24:39,895","00:24:41,806",It was nice knowing you!
501,"00:24:41,981","00:24:44,188","Hey, I need to readjust the harness.
It's a little too tight."
502,"00:24:44,274","00:24:46,265","- This should be enough rope.
- Should be?"
503,"00:24:46,443","00:24:48,229","We don't know
exactly how far down it is."
504,"00:24:48,320","00:24:50,276",It's also all the rope we have.
505,"00:24:50,406","00:24:52,146","Okay, ifwe're gonna do this,
we gotta do it fast."

- Listen up."
508,"00:24:54,785","00:24:56,650","Pull once to go lower,
twice to stay put,"

- Uh..."
510,"00:24:58,372","00:25:00,112","Four pulls means
you've reached the bottom"
511,"00:25:00,290","00:25:02,281","- and it's safe for us to come down.
- Wait. What was the second one?"
512,"00:25:02,459","00:25:03,995","Look, it doesn't really matter."
513,"00:25:04,128","00:25:05,117",Ow.

and more Cloud."
529,"00:25:35,826","00:25:37,441",Wait. Wait. What is that?
530,"00:25:37,619","00:25:40,235","- Oh, no!
- Sorry, that was just my hand."
531,"00:25:40,414","00:25:41,574",Okay.
532,"00:25:41,665","00:25:43,451",Still clouds. More clouds.
533,"00:25:43,584","00:25:44,994","- Uh...
- Man, there's a lot Of Clouds."
534,"00:25:45,085","00:25:46,495","- Meechee, you out here?
- Thorpl"
535,"00:25:46,587","00:25:48,123",Uh-Oh.

539,"00:25:53,594","00:25:55,334",Mystical creature!
540,"00:25:55,637","00:25:56,968","Uh, what was that?"
541,"00:25:57,056","00:25:58,762","Uh, it's the wind!"
542,"00:25:58,932","00:26:01,218","- Huh?
- Yeah, it makes strange noises out here."
543,"00:26:01,310","00:26:02,470",OOO!
544,"00:26:02,561","00:26:03,892",Mystical creature!

546,"00:26:10,486","00:26:11,817",StOp it. You're all acting weird.
547,"00:26:11,987","00:26:15,024","I don't like weird.
Weird is weird, Okay?"
548,"00:26:18,327","00:26:21,569","I thought I heard Migo's high-pitched,
kind Of annoying voice. Where is he?"
549,"00:26:21,747","00:26:23,157","- Hanging over the...
- Honestly,"
550,"00:26:23,248","00:26:25,580","we have no idea of the status
Of his whereabouts."
551,"00:26:25,751","00:26:27,082",How many times was up?
552,"00:26:27,252","00:26:28,867",How many times?
553,"00:26:29,046","00:26:31,378","Something's not right here.
Let me think about this."
554,"00:26:35,010","00:26:36,796","Ugh, something's not adding up."
555,"00:26:37,012","00:26:38,843","Yeah, I can't do math."
556,"00:26:39,056","00:26:39,966",You're coming with me.
557,"00:26:42,476","00:26:43,181","Oh, no!"
558,"00:26:43,393","00:26:45,930",Definitely not enough rope!

759,"00:39:41,671","00:39:43,036",I'll Clear off a Space where you can
760,"00:39:43,131","00:39:44,541","just lie down
until the storm passes, Okay?"
761,"00:39:48,887","00:39:52,050","Percy Patterson here in what might be
my last broadcast ever."
762,"00:39:52,140","00:39:54,381","I might get eaten or roasted
or frozen solid"
763,"00:39:54,475","00:39:56,386","or some horrible combination
Of the three."
764,"00:39:56,477","00:39:57,466",But know this.
765,"00:39:57,604","00:40:00,721","Know that I risked my life
in pursuit of something extraordinary."
766,"00:40:00,815","00:40:01,895",Something bigger than us.
767,"00:40:02,775","00:40:04,811","Literally, so much bigger."
768,"00:40:04,986","00:40:07,352","Oh, great! You're moving.
I've almost finished Clearing Off..."
769,"00:40:09,115","00:40:11,606","I think he's saying
he wants to have me for dinner."
770,"00:40:20,126","00:40:22,333","Okay, okay, okay, Okay."
771,"00:40:24,756","00:40:25,745","Oh, what?"
772,"00:40:25,924","00:40:28,961","Come on,
you stupid frozen fingers!"
773,"00:40:31,012","00:40:32,001",There we go.
774,"00:40:32,180","00:40:34,546","Brenda, give me my glory."
775,"00:40:34,724","00:40:36,931","Upload this video, then send help."
776,"00:40:38,436","00:40:40,301",Please work! Please work! Please work!
777,"00:40:42,398","00:40:43,137",Yes!
778,"00:40:45,526","00:40:49,815",NO!
779,"00:40:51,324","00:40:52,359",Something else is in here.
780,"00:40:53,242","00:40:54,527","Judging by the echo,"
781,"00:40:54,619","00:40:58,111","I'd estimate distance is approximately
200 meters."
782,"00:40:58,456","00:41:00,117",Estimation wrong.
783,"00:41:15,473","00:41:18,715",My husband is back there sound asleep!
784,"00:41:18,893","00:41:20,758","- I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
- Not to mention the Children!"
785,"00:41:20,853","00:41:22,718",Took me weeks to get them to sleep!
786,"00:41:22,897","00:41:24,228","I don't even have kids,
but I can imagine"
787,"00:41:24,315","00:41:25,771",that is just a really hard thing to do.
788,"00:41:25,942","00:41:27,728","All I get is Six months
Of a little mommy time,"
789,"00:41:27,819","00:41:29,059",and you are ruining it!
790,"00:41:31,739","00:41:32,694",Huh?
791,"00:41:38,246","00:41:40,828","You just walk into my cave.
You don't even wipe your feet!"
792,"00:41:40,999","00:41:42,580","- Again, very, very sorry!
- You better be sorry."
793,"00:41:42,750","00:41:44,706","I don't know what you are
or where you came from,"
794,"00:41:44,877","00:41:46,617",but you better learn some manners!
795,"00:41:48,423","00:41:49,287",Did you see that?
796,"00:41:49,382","00:41:50,622","She was all like,
""You're gonna wake my husband."""
797,"00:41:50,717","00:41:52,048","And I was like,
""You gotta get out of here."""
798,"00:41:52,218","00:41:54,550","And then you totally understood me.
We were communicating."
799,"00:41:54,721","00:41:55,676",This is amazing!
800,"00:42:05,690","00:42:06,679","Don't be stupid, Percy."
801,"00:42:06,774","00:42:08,639","DO not go back to help
the big, ferocious yeti."
802,"00:42:08,735","00:42:09,895",Do not do it!
803,"00:42:10,820","00:42:13,152","Although he did just
save you from a bear."
804,"00:42:13,948","00:42:14,983",Argh!
805,"00:42:15,158","00:42:17,945","This is the wrong time
to grow a conscience!"
806,"00:42:27,879","00:42:28,914",Wow.
807,"00:42:29,172","00:42:31,083","It's okay, big fellow."
808,"00:42:31,174","00:42:32,414",Let's get this thing off.
809,"00:42:32,592","00:42:34,002",DoeS this hurt?
810,"00:42:34,093","00:42:35,549",Sorry. This? How about this?
811,"00:42:35,636","00:42:37,297",This? This? Sorry.
812,"00:42:37,388","00:42:38,423","- StOp it!
- Got it."
813,"00:42:38,514","00:42:41,051",Okay. It's okay. I'm okay.
814,"00:42:50,651","00:42:51,857",Ah.
815,"00:43:00,745","00:43:02,736","Oh, the storm's lifted!"
816,"00:43:02,914","00:43:05,326","What do you say me and you get up
that mountain and prove you exist?"
817,"00:43:05,625","00:43:06,705",Hmm?
818,"00:43:06,918","00:43:09,204","Oh, right. Hand Signals.
Um..."
819,"00:43:21,516","00:43:22,756","This is unbelievable,"
820,"00:43:22,850","00:43:27,810","but I think the yeti is actually
trying to communicate with me."
821,"00:43:27,980","00:43:29,936",And I think he wants me to go with him.
822,"00:43:31,317","00:43:33,182","This is either the bravest thing
I've ever done"
823,"00:43:33,277","00:43:34,608",or the stupidest.
824,"00:43:34,779","00:43:37,111",Here's hoping it's the former.
825,"00:43:37,740","00:43:39,150","Oh, I almost forgot."
826,"00:43:39,242","00:43:40,607",Here. These should keep you warm.
827,"00:43:40,701","00:43:42,362","NO, no, no."
828,"00:43:42,453","00:43:44,660",Oh! That's actually quite nice.
829,"00:43:49,335","00:43:50,324",Yeah!
830,"00:43:51,712","00:43:53,452",Whoo-hoo!
831,"00:44:12,567","00:44:13,647",We're almost there.
832,"00:44:23,286","00:44:25,743","Up and at them, Migo.
Time to ring the gong!"
833,"00:44:26,414","00:44:28,905","Why is this
so hard this morning?"
834,"00:44:32,670","00:44:33,830",Launch!
835,"00:44:34,005","00:44:35,120",Migo?
836,"00:44:35,298","00:44:36,913","Migo, time to ring the..."
837,"00:44:38,050","00:44:40,257","Oh, yeah. Banished."
838,"00:44:46,559","00:44:47,548",Uh-oh.
839,"00:44:58,529","00:45:00,269",Huh? What the...
840,"00:45:10,041","00:45:11,201",Two gongs?
841,"00:45:11,417","00:45:12,953",Whatjust happened?
842,"00:45:14,128","00:45:15,993",Don't ask. Just push it down.
843,"00:45:16,297","00:45:17,958",Push it down.
844,"00:45:20,092","00:45:21,127",My helmet?
845,"00:45:25,848","00:45:27,839","Drop me!
Quickly, before I change my mind."
846,"00:45:28,017","00:45:29,507","You can't do this, Meech!"
847,"00:45:29,685","00:45:30,925",You're our leader!
848,"00:45:31,103","00:45:32,513",Exactly why I should do it!
849,"00:45:32,605","00:45:33,640",Drop me!
850,"00:45:33,898","00:45:34,887",Okay.
851,"00:45:35,066","00:45:37,899","This is terrifying.
I cannot believe Migo did this."
852,"00:45:37,985","00:45:40,818","Which is why maybe, you know,
you shouldn't!"
853,"00:45:40,905","00:45:43,021","I just wanna say,
I'm fine with it being you."
854,"00:45:43,115","00:45:44,104",I Should go.
855,"00:45:44,200","00:45:47,067","I'm strongest, and I've trained myself
to sleep with my eyes Open."
856,"00:45:47,245","00:45:50,328","I'm asleep right now.
You're all part of my dream."
857,"00:45:50,414","00:45:52,530","He'S down there
because I convinced him to go!"
858,"00:45:52,625","00:45:53,956",And he might be lost or hurt.
859,"00:45:54,126","00:45:55,491","- Or dead.
- Fleem!"
860,"00:45:55,586","00:45:57,326","Oh, what? Now we're not about the truth?"
861,"00:45:57,421","00:45:59,252","Last time, we dropped him
because Thorp Showed up,"
862,"00:45:59,340","00:46:01,205","which he might do again,
so can we please go?"
863,"00:46:01,300","00:46:02,335",Guys! Guys!
864,"00:46:02,426","00:46:04,166","Oh, I can still hear

887,"00:46:58,107","00:47:00,063",No one's gonna think I'm crazy anymore.
888,"00:47:00,151","00:47:01,732",He's so beautiful!
889,"00:47:01,819","00:47:04,310",And so Short.
890,"00:47:04,488","00:47:06,900","You did it, Migo. You actually did it!"

- EstabliShing dominance."
896,"00:47:21,255","00:47:22,335",No.
897,"00:47:22,506","00:47:23,495",We don't dominate.
898,"00:47:23,591","00:47:25,832",We welcome him with Open arms.
899,"00:47:25,926","00:47:27,336","Oh, did I just do that?"

923,"00:48:18,312","00:48:21,475","there are moments in life
that are imbued with such importance,"
924,"00:48:21,565","00:48:24,147",we must pause and look deeper
925,"00:48:24,235","00:48:27,022","into the moment
Of the place in which we are"
926,"00:48:27,196","00:48:30,154",to hold such beauteous gravitas
927,"00:48:30,324","00:48:31,404",and take in the beauty...
928,"00:48:31,492","00:48:33,608","- I'm losing interest!
- Get to the point!"
929,"00:48:33,702","00:48:35,283","Yep, okay. Here we go."
930,"00:48:35,371","00:48:38,784","Fellow yetis, behold, the smallfoot!"
931,"00:48:42,128","00:48:43,538",Mmm-hmm.
932,"00:48:52,054","00:48:53,635",I can't believe my eyes.
933,"00:48:53,722","00:48:55,929","These aren't primitive beasts
living in caves."
934,"00:48:56,934","00:48:58,970",This is a complex Civilization.
935,"00:49:00,104","00:49:01,719","DO you know
what this means for the world?"
936,"00:49:02,148","00:49:05,231",A Percy Patterson network special.
937,"00:49:05,317","00:49:06,773","You're welcome, world!"
938,"00:49:10,114","00:49:11,103",So...
939,"00:49:13,367","00:49:15,824","...what's all the excitement
about this time?"
940,"00:49:15,995","00:49:17,485",Migo found a smallfoot!
941,"00:49:18,164","00:49:19,119",That's one guess.
942,"00:49:19,290","00:49:21,827","But, Dad, look at the small foot!"
943,"00:49:22,042","00:49:23,031",Hmm.
944,"00:49:23,127","00:49:25,539",Don't yaks have small feet?
945,"00:49:25,713","00:49:27,078","Let me take it into the palace,"
946,"00:49:27,173","00:49:28,379","consult the stones,"
947,"00:49:28,466","00:49:30,002",and determine what it is.
948,"00:49:30,176","00:49:33,168","What if it is a smallfoot?
Does that mean a stone is wrong?"
949,"00:49:33,429","00:49:35,511","- They're all wrong.
- Yeah."
950,"00:49:35,598","00:49:36,678",YETl: Tell us the truth!
951,"00:49:37,850","00:49:39,465","Garry, just breathe."
952,"00:49:39,935","00:49:41,425","Everyone, please."
953,"00:49:41,520","00:49:44,136","What do the stones
tell us about questions?"
954,"00:49:57,745","00:49:59,451",I have so many questions!
955,"00:50:01,123","00:50:02,408","- Where is it from?
- Why is it pink?"
956,"00:50:02,500","00:50:04,081","- How did you get it here?
- What does it eat?"
957,"00:50:04,168","00:50:06,033","How does it think
with such a tiny little brain?"
958,"00:50:06,420","00:50:08,627","Honestly, I have just
as many questions as you do."
959,"00:50:09,798","00:50:11,254","- Where is its horn?
- Is that its ear?"
960,"00:50:11,342","00:50:12,331",Does it want a bite of fruit?
961,"00:50:12,426","00:50:14,166","How is it here
if a stone says it can't be?"
962,"00:50:14,261","00:50:18,925",It's all much bigger than we know
963,"00:50:19,016","00:50:20,005","- How?
- Why?"
964,"00:50:20,100","00:50:21,089",What do you mean?
965,"00:50:21,185","00:50:23,267",It's only just beginning to unfold
966,"00:50:23,354","00:50:25,094","- I'm SO confused.
- There'S more to know?"
967,"00:50:25,189","00:50:27,430",So let it all unfold
968,"00:50:27,608","00:50:29,473",I never knew there was more to know
969,"00:50:29,568","00:50:31,650",Isn't it all so amazing?
970,"00:50:31,737","00:50:35,650","There's a world mysterious
There for you to find"
971,"00:50:36,033","00:50:38,399","Out of the blue, there was room to grow"
972,"00:50:38,577","00:50:40,317",Isn't it all kind of crazy?
973,"00:50:40,412","00:50:43,825","All we are is curious
There '3 nothing wrong with that"
974,"00:50:44,792","00:50:47,784",So go 'round every corner
975,"00:50:47,878","00:50:49,118",You call that art?
976,"00:50:49,296","00:50:51,753",Search every part of the sky
977,"00:50:51,924","00:50:53,289","- What is he doing?
- Is he really gonna fly?"
978,"00:50:53,467","00:50:56,959",'Cause a life that's full of wonder
979,"00:50:58,847","00:51:01,463",Is a wonderful life
980,"00:51:12,987","00:51:14,022",Whoo!
981,"00:51:32,715","00:51:35,047","- BIOSSOm, sit.
- I got you."
982,"00:51:35,217","00:51:36,502",Down. Down!
983,"00:51:43,350","00:51:45,136","Do you see
what you've started?"
984,"00:51:45,603","00:51:47,719",Yes! Do you? Look at them!
985,"00:51:47,813","00:51:50,350","We have been living in fear
for too long, Dad."
986,"00:51:50,441","00:51:53,308","All I ever wanted to do
was keep you safe, Meechee."
987,"00:51:53,652","00:51:57,110","Everything I do,
I do to protect the village and you."
988,"00:51:57,281","00:52:00,364","I don't need you to protect me.
I need you to listen to me."
989,"00:52:00,659","00:52:01,865","To all of us,"
990,"00:52:01,952","00:52:03,488",especially Migo!
991,"00:52:03,579","00:52:05,035","Dad, he went below the clouds."
992,"00:52:05,205","00:52:06,570",They're talking to Migo
993,"00:52:06,665","00:52:09,031","because they have questions,
and he's listening"
994,"00:52:09,126","00:52:11,287","instead of telling them
to just push them down."
995,"00:52:11,378","00:52:14,666","But, believe me, you are their leader,
and they wish it was you."
996,"00:52:14,840","00:52:17,673",So just talk to Migo about what he saw.
997,"00:52:17,760","00:52:18,670",Please.
998,"00:52:19,928","00:52:23,261","You're right.
That's exactly what I need to do."
999,"00:52:27,519","00:52:29,430",I'm gonna go get the smallfoot! Bye!
1000,"00:52:30,564","00:52:33,226","That's a snood.
It's like a sort Of scarf."
1001,"00:52:33,317","00:52:35,854","That's a fiber supplement.
I'd rather not go into it."
1002,"00:52:35,944","00:52:36,933",That'S a sock.
1003,"00:52:37,029","00:52:39,566","It's a lining
between your Shoe and your foot."
1004,"00:52:39,657","00:52:41,397",That's not how you're supposed... Ugh.
1005,"00:52:41,492","00:52:42,902",Four days I had them on.
1006,"00:52:43,577","00:52:46,569","Can you translate
the Scroll Of Invisible Wisdom?"
1007,"00:52:46,747","00:52:47,702",Ah...
1008,"00:52:47,915","00:52:51,533","Yes. Actually, I do need this."
1009,"00:52:51,627","00:52:52,616",Okay.
1010,"00:52:53,921","00:52:55,001",Ugh!
1011,"00:52:55,172","00:52:56,628",It is not wisdom
1012,"00:52:56,715","00:52:58,501",and definitely not invisible.
1013,"00:52:58,592","00:53:00,674","- Hmm.
- Hey, where's Migo?"
1014,"00:53:01,470","00:53:03,051","Hey, Dad! Dad!"
1015,"00:53:03,222","00:53:05,554","Oh, is this the best day ever or what?"
1016,"00:53:06,308","00:53:07,297",Dad?
1017,"00:53:09,269","00:53:10,884","What's wrong?
What happened to your helmet?"
1018,"00:53:10,979","00:53:12,264",I missed the gong.
1019,"00:53:12,439","00:53:15,977","But the sky snail, it came up anwuay."
1020,"00:53:16,902","00:53:20,065",Whoa! So another stone is wrong.
1021,"00:53:20,155","00:53:22,521","- This is amazing.
- Amazing?"
1022,"00:53:22,616","00:53:24,402",What's so amazing about it?
1023,"00:53:24,576","00:53:27,739","The stones are supposed to be stones,
you know?"
1024,"00:53:27,830","00:53:30,867","Sturdy, reliable, true."
1025,"00:53:31,041","00:53:33,453","And now the snail is
just rising on its own?"
1026,"00:53:33,544","00:53:34,624",If it even is a snail.
1027,"00:53:34,795","00:53:36,660","Meechee thinks it might be
a flaming ball of gas."
1028,"00:53:36,839","00:53:37,999",Gas?
1029,"00:53:38,507","00:53:41,544","I've been banging my head on that thing
to wake up a gas ball?"
1030,"00:53:41,969","00:53:43,709",That's usually what wakes me up.
1031,"00:53:44,763","00:53:46,549","Look, Dad,
I know all of this change is scary."
1032,"00:53:46,807","00:53:48,547",But maybe this is a good thing.
1033,"00:53:49,268","00:53:52,055","Maybe there's something even better
than banging your head against the gong."
1034,"00:53:52,146","00:53:55,980","But if I don't ring the gong,
I'm not the gong ringer."
1035,"00:53:56,567","00:53:58,228","And if I'm not the gong ringer,"
1036,"00:53:59,153","00:54:00,313",then what am I?
1037,"00:54:05,451","00:54:06,657","Hey, Migo!"
1038,"00:54:08,579","00:54:09,864",My dad wants to see you.
1039,"00:54:10,038","00:54:11,903",The Stonekeeper. Really?
1040,"00:54:12,082","00:54:15,700","Which must be nice for you 'cause
he never wants to see me. Heh."
1041,"00:54:15,878","00:54:16,742",Okay.
1042,"00:54:16,920","00:54:19,127","Why did I Shout that out?
That's so embarrassing."
1043,"00:54:19,298","00:54:21,038","Ugh. Blew it again, Thorp."
1044,"00:54:22,301","00:54:23,757","Hey, Dad. I'll be back."
1045,"00:54:24,845","00:54:26,585","- Dad?
- Hmm."
1046,"00:54:41,612","00:54:43,068",Look at them.
1047,"00:54:43,822","00:54:46,529",The great Stonekeepers of the past.
1048,"00:54:47,242","00:54:49,028",Each one adding new stones
1049,"00:54:49,119","00:54:52,031","as they received wisdom
about what was best for the village."
1050,"00:54:54,500","00:54:56,286","- RObe looks heavy.
- It is."
1051,"00:54:56,460","00:54:59,327",It requires a strong backbone.
1052,"00:55:21,235","00:55:23,226",Whoa. Secret stairs. Okay.
1053,"00:55:32,996","00:55:33,985",Um...
1054,"00:55:34,748","00:55:36,033",Where are you taking me?
1055,"00:55:37,334","00:55:38,744",So many questions.
1056,"00:55:40,170","00:55:43,128","Think it's about time
I give you some answers."
1057,"00:55:48,762","00:55:49,751",Wow!
1058,"00:55:51,515","00:55:53,506",What is this?
1059,"00:55:54,226","00:55:55,682","You see, Migo..."
1060,"00:55:55,853","00:55:58,640","There was a time
When yetis lived beneath the clouds"
1061,"00:55:58,814","00:56:00,475","We were alive
And we were thrivin'"
1062,"00:56:00,649","00:56:03,061","Till we came across a crowd
Of smallfoot"
1063,"00:56:03,235","00:56:05,317","That's right, we used to live
Down there"
1064,"00:56:05,487","00:56:07,694","But there were actions
We could not forgive"
1065,"00:56:07,781","00:56:09,112",Down there
1066,"00:56:09,199","00:56:11,531","And though they used
A different nomenclature"
1067,"00:56:11,702","00:56:14,785","Man or human
They showed us human nature"
1068,"00:56:14,872","00:56:17,705","A dangerous species
Though we approached with wonder"
1069,"00:56:17,875","00:56:21,163","They attacked with their spears
And their smoking sticks of thunder"
1070,"00:56:21,336","00:56:24,078","They called us Sasquatch
They called us abominable"
1071,"00:56:24,256","00:56:27,373","They chased us, pursued us
Their persistence indomitable"
1072,"00:56:27,551","00:56:30,293",We had no choice but to run and hide
1073,"00:56:30,470","00:56:32,882","Othen/vise, we surmised
We were facing genocide"
1074,"00:56:33,056","00:56:36,048","So we climbed this mountain
Just to stay alive"
1075,"00:56:36,143","00:56:39,727","You see, we knew that up here
Smallfoot could not survive"
1076,"00:56:39,813","00:56:42,600","So it was here the first law
Was written in stone"
1077,"00:56:42,691","00:56:45,899","It was named and proclaimed
As a truth to be known"
1078,"00:56:46,069","00:56:50,438","Our world is an island that floats
On a sea of endless clouds"
1079,"00:56:50,616","00:56:51,731",That's how it would be
1080,"00:56:55,203","00:56:57,785","For the sake of us all
It was the only way"
1081,"00:56:57,956","00:57:01,494","To protect us
From all of the human ravages"
1082,"00:57:01,668","00:57:04,785",Heaped upon us by those human savages
1083,"00:57:04,963","00:57:07,796","Now you know
Now you know, now you know"
1084,"00:57:08,050","00:57:09,665","Now you know, now you know"
1085,"00:57:09,843","00:57:11,379",And new rules apply
1086,"00:57:11,470","00:57:14,212","Now you know, now you know, now you know"
1087,"00:57:14,389","00:57:17,426","So it's bestjust
To let it lie, let it lie"
1088,"00:57:17,517","00:57:20,224","Now you know
Now you know, now you know"
1089,"00:57:20,437","00:57:22,268","Now you know, now you know"
1090,"00:57:22,356","00:57:23,846",And you can't deny
1091,"00:57:24,024","00:57:27,141","Now you know, now you know, now you know"
1092,"00:57:27,235","00:57:31,319","That it's best just to let it lie
Let it lie"
1093,"00:57:31,406","00:57:33,397","But my smallfoot, he's not like that."
1094,"00:57:33,492","00:57:35,153",They're all like that.
1095,"00:57:35,410","00:57:36,741","Tell me, when you found him,"
1096,"00:57:37,120","00:57:38,576",did he greet you with open arms?
1097,"00:57:46,004","00:57:47,585",They don't care about us.
1098,"00:57:47,756","00:57:50,122","They don't care about anything
but themselves,"
1099,"00:57:50,217","00:57:52,082","which is why we must do the same,"
1100,"00:57:52,844","00:57:54,675",if we care about our future.
1101,"00:58:25,877","00:58:27,287",We're below the clouds.
1102,"00:58:27,462","00:58:29,669","Or SO it would seem,
but look Closer."
1103,"00:58:29,840","00:58:32,126",Those aren't Clouds! It's steam.
1104,"00:58:32,300","00:58:35,007",The stones are working.
1105,"00:58:35,262","00:58:36,297",The stones?
1106,"00:58:37,848","00:58:39,713",Every job and every task
1107,"00:58:39,808","00:58:41,423",As pointless as it seems
1108,"00:58:41,601","00:58:44,593","All of it ensures
That this important machine"
1109,"00:58:44,771","00:58:46,932","Keeps churning and turning
And spinning around"
1110,"00:58:47,107","00:58:49,849","So those below don't look up
And those above don't look down"
1111,"00:58:50,027","00:58:51,358",And they'll look
1112,"00:58:51,528","00:58:53,769","'Cause even if they hear
Of these atrocities"
1113,"00:58:53,864","00:58:57,482","The only thing stronger than fear
ls curiosity"
1114,"00:58:57,659","00:58:59,650","Now you know
Now you know, now you know"
1115,"00:58:59,828","00:59:02,695","Wait. SO none Of those stones are true?
They're all lies?"
1116,"00:59:02,789","00:59:03,949",Let it lie
1117,"00:59:04,041","00:59:06,327",Good lies. To protect our world.
1118,"00:59:06,501","00:59:07,957",But they need to know the truth.
1119,"00:59:08,128","00:59:09,288","Oh, do they?"
1120,"00:59:09,463","00:59:12,546","You feel emboldened
By your noble quest to find the truth"
1121,"00:59:12,716","00:59:15,583","I chalk it up
To the naive innocence of youth"
1122,"00:59:15,761","00:59:18,924","So let me share a secret
That you'll learn as you grow older"
1123,"00:59:19,097","00:59:21,964","What's true or not true
Is in the eye of the beholder"
1124,"00:59:22,142","00:59:24,554","So do you wanna prevent
Our own annihilation?"
1125,"00:59:24,728","00:59:25,558",Yes!
1126,"00:59:25,645","00:59:28,432","Then our only goal should be
To control the flow of information"
1127,"00:59:28,523","00:59:30,809","Unless you want to see the smallfoot
Conquer and pillage"
1128,"00:59:30,901","00:59:31,811",NO!
1129,"00:59:31,985","00:59:35,148","Then protect the lie
And you protect the village"
1130,"00:59:36,073","00:59:37,609","Lives are at stake, Migo."
1131,"00:59:37,783","00:59:41,150","Your friends, your father, Meechee."
1132,"00:59:41,328","00:59:43,614",Okay. I want to know everything
1133,"00:59:43,705","00:59:46,071","there is to know
about you and your world."
1134,"00:59:46,249","00:59:47,659",She's curious.
1135,"00:59:47,751","00:59:51,335","And you know what they say.
""Curiosity killed the yak."""
1136,"00:59:51,505","00:59:53,086",So what do you want me to do?
1137,"00:59:53,632","00:59:55,998","Tell everyone you were lying
about the smallfoot."
1138,"00:59:56,093","00:59:59,585","But they've already seen it.
They're not gonna believe me."
1139,"01:00:00,347","01:00:02,588","You'd be surprised
at what they'll believe."
1140,"01:00:03,600","01:00:05,886","You think knowledge is power, Migo?"
1141,"01:00:06,061","01:00:08,848","Now you know
Now you know, now you know"
1142,"01:00:08,939","01:00:10,429","Now you know, now you know"
1143,"01:00:10,607","01:00:11,938",Question is...
1144,"01:00:12,109","01:00:15,647","Now you know
Now you know, now you know"
1145,"01:00:15,737","01:00:17,853","...what are you gonna
do with that power?"
1146,"01:00:23,537","01:00:25,402","Okay. It's a little fuzzy,"
1147,"01:00:25,580","01:00:26,786",but I think I'm starting to get it.
1148,"01:00:27,415","01:00:29,451","YourjOb is to tell stories
that fly through the air"
1149,"01:00:29,543","01:00:30,908","in a series of pictures
in rapid succession"
1150,"01:00:31,002","01:00:32,538","that magically appear
in other smallfoots' homes."
1151,"01:00:32,712","01:00:35,169",TV. Right!
1152,"01:00:35,340","01:00:37,080",And what is this thing here?
1153,"01:00:37,259","01:00:39,545",That's the roof of my home.
1154,"01:00:39,678","01:00:40,918","- Home.
- Home?"
1155,"01:00:43,014","01:00:44,345",Are we saying the same thing?
1156,"01:00:45,976","01:00:47,557","Oh, is that, like, your best friend?"
1157,"01:00:47,727","01:00:49,718",That iS evil banker man.
1158,"01:00:49,896","01:00:51,432",He wants to take my home away
1159,"01:00:51,523","01:00:54,515","because Of something
called a ""variable interest rate."""
1160,"01:00:55,986","01:00:58,272","Apparently, I don't know
what it means either."
1161,"01:00:58,363","01:01:01,571","The air is
really thin up here, isn't it?"
1162,"01:01:03,451","01:01:04,816",Those are animals.
1163,"01:01:10,208","01:01:11,323",Cheeky.
1164,"01:01:11,418","01:01:14,501","Anyway, the point is,
this is why I do what I do, see?"
1165,"01:01:14,588","01:01:17,705","I was fascinated
with other species, like you."
1166,"01:01:18,425","01:01:21,792","Actually, nothing like you.
You're quite extraordinary."
1167,"01:01:22,846","01:01:26,634","But lately, I started to only care
about how many people are watching,"
1168,"01:01:26,725","01:01:28,056",how popular I am.
1169,"01:01:28,602","01:01:29,591",Wow.
1170,"01:01:29,686","01:01:31,426",Hearing myself say this out loud...
1171,"01:01:32,147","01:01:34,138","What's the yeti word for ""pathetic""?"
1172,"01:01:35,066","01:01:37,432","When I was nine, I saw my first lion."
1173,"01:01:37,903","01:01:39,359","It looked like this, see?"
1174,"01:01:42,949","01:01:45,986","It looked nothing like this.
That looks like a fat poodle."
1175,"01:01:46,077","01:01:47,362","Here, I'll just show you."
1176,"01:01:48,455","01:01:49,991","Whoa, whoa, whoa."
1177,"01:01:51,124","01:01:52,955",Okay. What is that thing?
1178,"01:01:53,960","01:01:56,952","They don't care about us.
Lives are at stake, Migo."
1179,"01:01:57,047","01:01:59,038","They don't care about anything
but themselves."
1180,"01:01:59,132","01:02:00,212",Good lies.
1181,"01:02:00,383","01:02:02,419","Which is why we must do the same.
Protect our world."
1182,"01:02:02,510","01:02:05,673","Your friends, your father,
Meechee."
1183,"01:02:05,764","01:02:07,220","No, don't do that."
1184,"01:02:07,307","01:02:09,389","What are you doing? You're ruining it!
Stop! Stop it!"
1185,"01:02:09,559","01:02:11,299","Red one up! Up, up!
Now, over to the blue one."
1186,"01:02:11,394","01:02:13,009",Blue one. Three in a row! Yes!
1187,"01:02:13,104","01:02:14,139","- Meechee?
- Not now, Migo."
1188,"01:02:14,356","01:02:16,438","Ooh! Okay, down, down. Right side.
Purple thingy."
1189,"01:02:16,608","01:02:18,018","Slide it, Slide it."
1190,"01:02:18,193","01:02:20,058",Oh! There we go! Boom!
1191,"01:02:20,237","01:02:21,317",Ha-ha! Whoo!
1192,"01:02:21,529","01:02:24,896","Migo, I'm putting Shapes next to
other shapes to make the rows disappear."
1193,"01:02:24,991","01:02:28,279","It's pointless and a total waste
of time, but I can't stop."
1194,"01:02:29,287","01:02:31,323",There goes our high score.
1195,"01:02:31,623","01:02:32,612",Smallfoot?
1196,"01:02:32,791","01:02:34,247","Hey, are you okay?"
1197,"01:02:37,671","01:02:38,751",Getting a little woozy.
1198,"01:02:38,922","01:02:42,631","I'm going to need
some more oxygen. Oxygen."
1199,"01:02:42,717","01:02:44,253",I can't remember my own name.
1200,"01:02:44,427","01:02:45,667",Um...
1201,"01:02:45,762","01:02:46,751",What's all this?
1202,"01:02:47,555","01:02:49,466","Oh, uh, we learned how to communicate!"
1203,"01:02:49,808","01:02:50,797",That'S his world...
1204,"01:02:50,892","01:02:51,927","...and I think it's really big,"
1205,"01:02:52,018","01:02:53,554",and there are more smallfeet down there.
1206,"01:02:53,728","01:02:54,843","Like, a lot more."
1207,"01:02:56,898","01:02:59,184","Migo, I think something's wrong."
1208,"01:02:59,359","01:03:01,145",He doesn't look so good.
1209,"01:03:01,236","01:03:03,022",He's cold and his breathing is off.
1210,"01:03:03,113","01:03:06,697","You see, we knew that
up here, smallfoot could not survive."
1211,"01:03:07,659","01:03:08,990","I think we need
to take him home."
1212,"01:03:09,160","01:03:10,696",What? No!
1213,"01:03:10,954","01:03:14,242","NO? Why not? What if he's really sick?
What if he needs help?"
1214,"01:03:14,332","01:03:15,788",Just stop asking questions!
1215,"01:03:15,959","01:03:17,824",Stop asking questions?
1216,"01:03:20,255","01:03:22,371","Attention, everyone!"
1217,"01:03:22,465","01:03:24,330",The Stonekeeper has an announcement.
1218,"01:03:25,468","01:03:26,674",What's going on? Do you know?
1219,"01:03:26,761","01:03:28,001",'Cause you look like you know something.
1220,"01:03:28,179","01:03:29,589",Just stop. Please.
1221,"01:03:30,432","01:03:31,968","Well, well, well,"
1222,"01:03:32,142","01:03:33,723",what an interesting day it's been.
1223,"01:03:33,810","01:03:37,098",A day full of excitement and questions.
1224,"01:03:37,272","01:03:39,638",So many questions.
1225,"01:03:39,733","01:03:43,646","I must admit, the events Of the day
even had me asking a few."
1226,"01:03:43,737","01:03:45,273","Uh-Oh, I smell cover-up."
1227,"01:03:45,363","01:03:47,103",So I asked Migo to join me
1228,"01:03:47,198","01:03:50,531","so I could question him
about his amazing discovery."
1229,"01:03:50,618","01:03:53,405","And together,
we've reached the same conclusion."
1230,"01:03:53,496","01:03:55,157","Migo, tell them what we learned."
1231,"01:03:55,248","01:03:56,283",Yeah. Um...
1232,"01:03:59,878","01:04:02,915","The thing is, see... Uh..."
1233,"01:04:03,840","01:04:05,000","Yeah, it's, uh..."
1234,"01:04:05,091","01:04:08,299","What I was gonna tell you is, um..."
1235,"01:04:11,014","01:04:12,379",Uh...
1236,"01:04:14,059","01:04:15,219",It's not a smallfoot.
1237,"01:04:15,435","01:04:17,391",Wait. What?
1238,"01:04:17,562","01:04:20,144","Yeah. I was wrong, I got confused,"
1239,"01:04:20,231","01:04:21,937",and the Stonekeeper figured it out.
1240,"01:04:22,108","01:04:23,314",It's actually a type of yak.
1241,"01:04:23,401","01:04:24,481",A yak?
1242,"01:04:24,652","01:04:26,688",Migo found a rare breed
1243,"01:04:26,821","01:04:28,357",that even I didn't know about.
1244,"01:04:28,615","01:04:31,357",A red-coated pygmy hairless yak.
1245,"01:04:31,451","01:04:33,442",You know this is not a yak.
1246,"01:04:33,536","01:04:36,278","As you can see,
its existence is confirmed"
1247,"01:04:36,539","01:04:37,824",in stone.
1248,"01:04:41,586","01:04:42,746",What is happening?
1249,"01:04:42,879","01:04:45,495","The stones have protected us
for generations."
1250,"01:04:45,799","01:04:47,130",But we've been ignoring them.
1251,"01:04:47,300","01:04:50,007","NO one's been feeding
the great mountain mammoths today."
1252,"01:04:50,095","01:04:51,335",YETl: He's right.
1253,"01:04:51,429","01:04:53,260","And because of that, we are sinking."
1254,"01:04:53,390","01:04:54,846",I don't wanna Sink!
1255,"01:04:55,016","01:04:57,507","Garry, you're right to be afraid."
1256,"01:04:57,602","01:04:58,808","Everyone, listen to Garry."
1257,"01:04:58,978","01:05:01,185",I don't wanna Sink into the nothing!
1258,"01:05:01,272","01:05:03,888","These are lies, Migo.
We saw you go below the Clouds."
1259,"01:05:03,983","01:05:08,352","I didn't. I fell into the clouds,
and I found him inside Of a cave."
1260,"01:05:08,446","01:05:09,481",What?
1261,"01:05:09,572","01:05:12,439","Don't listen to him.
This is all part Of a massive cover-up!"
1262,"01:05:12,617","01:05:14,357","- Please, wait...
- We're all part of a big machine."
1263,"01:05:14,452","01:05:15,441","Dude, no. Come on, stop!"
1264,"01:05:15,537","01:05:17,368","In fact, I think it might be
a big machine that's down there!"
1265,"01:05:17,539","01:05:18,995",You need to stop!
1266,"01:05:19,165","01:05:20,280","- It does sound like a machine!
- I thought so, tOO!"
1267,"01:05:20,458","01:05:21,447","- You heard me!
- Just stop!"
1268,"01:05:23,086","01:05:25,577",A big machine.
1269,"01:05:25,672","01:05:26,912",Right!
1270,"01:05:27,090","01:05:29,376","Let's all listen to Gwangi
and his whacked-out theories"
1271,"01:05:29,467","01:05:31,549",because we all know that Gwangi is
1272,"01:05:31,636","01:05:33,467",just straight-up crazy.
1273,"01:05:35,515","01:05:36,755","Come on, are we really
gonna listen to these guys?"
1274,"01:05:36,850","01:05:39,637","They're the village weirdos, right?
We all know that."
1275,"01:05:39,727","01:05:41,763","They're just trying to prove
all the stones wrong."
1276,"01:05:41,938","01:05:45,977","But if we don't follow the stones,
really bad things can happen."
1277,"01:05:47,193","01:05:49,775","Well said, Migo.
That's the truth."
1278,"01:05:49,946","01:05:51,436",The truth?
1279,"01:05:51,531","01:05:54,113","I don't think anybody around here
cares what that is."
1280,"01:05:57,120","01:05:58,701","Guys, wait."
1281,"01:05:58,788","01:05:59,948","Migo, give him to me."
1282,"01:06:00,707","01:06:02,618",Wait. What are you doing?
1283,"01:06:02,709","01:06:05,451","NO, nO, no!
He needs warmth, and he can't breathe!"
1284,"01:06:05,545","01:06:07,706","- Meechee.
- Why are you doing this?"
1285,"01:06:07,881","01:06:10,668","This is something
we should discuss inside."
1286,"01:06:12,260","01:06:13,466",Inside.
1287,"01:06:16,890","01:06:17,925","Yes, Father."
1288,"01:06:18,558","01:06:20,389","Meechee, we need to talk."
1289,"01:06:20,477","01:06:21,933",I think you've said enough.
1290,"01:06:24,189","01:06:25,099","Okay, everyone."
1291,"01:06:25,273","01:06:28,265","Now everything
can go back to the way it was."
1292,"01:06:28,359","01:06:31,066","Everyone, back to work.
The village won't run itself."
1293,"01:06:31,863","01:06:34,400","The smallfoot,
what are you gonna do with him?"
1294,"01:06:34,491","01:06:37,449","We're taking him back to the cave
where you found him."
1295,"01:06:37,619","01:06:39,280",But I didn't find him in a cave.
1296,"01:06:39,370","01:06:42,237","But you said you did,
so they believe you."
1297,"01:06:42,999","01:06:44,580","You've done a good thing, Migo."
1298,"01:06:59,516","01:07:00,631","Stonekeeper, wait!"
1299,"01:07:02,060","01:07:03,891",NO!
1300,"01:07:05,146","01:07:06,886","You've done your job, Migo."
1301,"01:07:07,690","01:07:08,850",GO home.
1302,"01:07:50,233","01:07:51,518",Migo?
1303,"01:07:52,193","01:07:54,809",What's wrong? What are you doing?
1304,"01:07:54,904","01:07:57,486","lwasjust thinking
about Stone 15."
1305,"01:07:57,865","01:07:59,071",Uh...
1306,"01:07:59,158","01:08:00,648","""Ignorance is bliss""?"
1307,"01:08:00,743","01:08:02,699",Yeah. That one's true.
1308,"01:08:03,371","01:08:04,952","Ignorance is bliss,"
1309,"01:08:05,582","01:08:06,788",or at least it was.
1310,"01:08:07,625","01:08:10,992","I was pretty happy
when I didn't know about the smallfoot"
1311,"01:08:11,087","01:08:12,497",orthe S.E.S.
1312,"01:08:12,589","01:08:15,205",or how amazing Meechee really is.
1313,"01:08:15,925","01:08:18,917","And I'm pretty sure I'd be happier
not knowing that they hate me."
1314,"01:08:19,095","01:08:22,383",Or that I lied and betrayed them all.
1315,"01:08:25,184","01:08:26,515",I miss being ignorant.

1523,"01:20:22,651","01:20:23,891",We can't let them follow us home.
1524,"01:20:24,069","01:20:25,605","- Migol

1525,"01:20:25,779","01:20:27,019",NO!

1530,"01:21:18,499","01:21:21,241","I hope you understand
why I have to do this."
1531,"01:21:24,213","01:21:25,202",NO!
1532,"01:21:27,466","01:21:29,206","Oh, no! They got him!"

this is some kind ijOke?"
1538,"01:22:21,270","01:22:23,261","That depends.
Did you think it was funny?"
1539,"01:22:23,439","01:22:25,521",Just a publicity stunt for ratings.
1540,"01:22:25,607","01:22:27,438",Losen
1541,"01:22:27,651","01:22:30,063",That's not Migo! So where's Migo?

1543,"01:22:31,572","01:22:35,030","- Migo!
- You smallfoot shot me."
1544,"01:22:35,826","01:22:37,111",I can't feel my face!
1545,"01:22:37,286","01:22:39,151",Wait. SO he is bad?
1546,"01:22:39,246","01:22:41,032","No, no, he's not bad."
1547,"01:22:41,373","01:22:43,238",I think he Shot me to save me.
1548,"01:22:43,417","01:22:46,250",Yeah. You're right. He did.
1549,"01:22:46,420","01:22:47,830",He saved all of us.

1554,"01:23:00,142","01:23:01,131","Thank you, Brenda."
1555,"01:23:02,603","01:23:04,764","You're under arrest
for disturbing the peace,"
1556,"01:23:04,855","01:23:06,595","destruction of public property,"
1557,"01:23:06,690","01:23:08,180","discharging fireworks
within the city limits..."
1558,"01:23:08,358","01:23:09,188",Wait. Hang on.
1559,"01:23:09,276","01:23:10,937","...Internet fraud, loitering..."
1560,"01:23:11,361","01:23:12,350",...looking weird.
1561,"01:23:34,760","01:23:39,254","I love that little guy.
I love you guys, too."
1562,"01:23:39,431","01:23:44,471","And you are so awesome and smart,"
1563,"01:23:44,561","01:23:47,473",and I'm meet you. I mish you.
1564,"01:23:48,482","01:23:49,642",I mush you.
1565,"01:23:51,360","01:23:53,146","- I mush you, too, Migo.
- Mmm."
1566,"01:23:53,779","01:23:55,735","Okay, everyone, let's go home."
1567,"01:24:04,748","01:24:05,954","Okay, what'd I miss?"
1568,"01:24:14,550","01:24:17,337","This is our history.
And these are our ancestors."
1569,"01:24:17,511","01:24:19,092",There was a time when yetis lived
1570,"01:24:19,179","01:24:20,544",beneath the clouds.
1571,"01:24:20,639","01:24:23,096","We came up here
where the smallfoot couldn't survive."
1572,"01:24:23,183","01:24:26,516","You see, I thought the smallfoot
was my enemy. And then he saved me."
1573,"01:24:26,603","01:24:29,015","And I know that
I said it wasn't a smallfoot,"
1574,"01:24:29,106","01:24:30,642",but that wasn't true.
1575,"01:24:31,483","01:24:32,893",And I'm sorry that I lied to you.
1576,"01:24:34,861","01:24:38,774","The smallfoot is real,
and they live below the Clouds."
1577,"01:24:38,865","01:24:40,230",Clouds we make.
1578,"01:24:42,578","01:24:43,784",And this is why
1579,"01:24:43,954","01:24:47,037",Our ancestors decided to do that.
1580,"01:24:47,249","01:24:48,989",That's the truth. See?
1581,"01:24:50,502","01:24:52,914","It's complicated, and it can be scary,"
1582,"01:24:53,088","01:24:54,669",but it's better than living a lie.
1583,"01:24:55,966","01:24:57,046","Like, way better."
1584,"01:24:59,761","01:25:03,049","SO we didn't fall out of the butt
of the great Sky yak?"
1585,"01:25:03,223","01:25:04,303",Probably not.
1586,"01:25:04,474","01:25:05,634",Whose butt did we fall out of?
1587,"01:25:05,809","01:25:07,345","- You know what? We'll Circle back.
- Got it."
1588,"01:25:08,186","01:25:09,301",So now you know.
1589,"01:25:09,396","01:25:11,603","We think they're monsters,
and they think we are."
1590,"01:25:12,566","01:25:15,023","And that is not gonna change
by us hiding."
1591,"01:25:15,819","01:25:17,184",We have to communicate.
1592,"01:25:17,696","01:25:19,812","SO it's up to us to decide
what we wanna do."
1593,"01:26:24,179","01:26:27,888","It's time
Time to do"
1594,"01:26:28,558","01:26:32,471","Something drastic
Something new"
1595,"01:26:33,563","01:26:36,805","Right here
And right now"
1596,"01:26:37,984","01:26:41,351",We need to find a way somehow
1597,"01:26:43,281","01:26:47,320","It's about reaching out
Closing up the distance"
1598,"01:26:47,494","01:26:51,828","Instead of hate
Celebrate all the ways we 're different"
1599,"01:26:52,332","01:26:56,701","I am optimistic
Yes, I do believe"
1600,"01:26:56,878","01:27:00,120","We have the power to make
This world a better place"
1601,"01:27:00,632","01:27:05,501","But if it's ever gonna change
We gotta come together, me and you"
1602,"01:27:05,762","01:27:09,801","In a mo-oh-oh, oh-oh
A moment of truth"
1603,"01:27:09,891","01:27:11,802",If it's ever gonna change
1604,"01:27:11,893","01:27:15,181","We gotta come together, me and you"
1605,"01:27:15,355","01:27:19,018","In a mo-oh-oh, oh-oh
A moment of truth"
1606,"01:27:26,992","01:27:28,277",I'm not crazy!
1607,"01:27:28,452","01:27:29,407",Mmm-hmm.
1608,"01:27:40,839","01:27:43,751","Pro, if you go down there,
you'll meet lots of people."
1609,"01:27:43,842","01:27:46,333","Con, uh, you're not really
a people person."
1610,"01:27:46,428","01:27:47,543","Oh, this is torture!"
1611,"01:31:12,509","01:31:14,295","Okay, in three, two..."
