384,"00:21:22,166","00:21:23,916",Her parents are monsters.
385,"00:21:24,000","00:21:27,083","Yes, I know. That's why I need your he..."
386,"00:21:27,166","00:21:30,166","Dad. Dad. No, no, no, no, no.
These are our guests. Oh."
387,"00:21:30,250","00:21:31,875","Hey, Mom, you too."
388,"00:21:31,958","00:21:36,250","Oh, I thought it was a metaphor.
I thought you were just being dramatic."
389,"00:21:36,333","00:21:39,333","- Why would I do that?
- Because you're a teenager."
390,"00:21:40,458","00:21:43,458",Oh. Uh... Uh... Who wants Squeaky?
391,"00:21:43,541","00:21:44,833","Yeah, fetch!"
392,"00:21:46,250","00:21:47,375","Wait. Wait, sire."
393,"00:21:47,458","00:21:50,750",Sorry about that. They can be a lot.
394,"00:21:50,833","00:21:54,625","Princess, something tells me
your parents have been"
395,"00:21:54,708","00:21:59,208",in the Dark Forest of Eternal Darkness.
396,"00:21:59,291","00:22:01,958",So dark they named it twice.
397,"00:22:02,041","00:22:03,541","Well, yeah, they have."
398,"00:22:03,625","00:22:04,958",But how did you know?
399,"00:22:05,041","00:22:08,041","Because it's the only place
this sort of magic exists."
400,"00:22:08,125","00:22:11,375","And don't kill the messenger,
but if they don't change back soon,"
401,"00:22:11,458","00:22:12,958",they'll be monsters forever.
402,"00:22:13,041","00:22:15,916","What? No. Please, do something."
403,"00:22:16,000","00:22:17,958",Of course. Of course.
404,"00:22:18,041","00:22:21,208","We didn't travel all this way
in a frog's mouth for nothin'."
405,"00:22:21,291","00:22:24,125",Hand me the wand.
406,"00:22:25,916","00:22:26,958",Oh! Um...
407,"00:22:27,041","00:22:30,458","- I don't have the wand.
- Are you kidding? Where's the wand?"
408,"00:22:30,541","00:22:32,916",I traded it in for an upgrade.
409,"00:22:33,000","00:22:34,708",What? Why would you do that?
410,"00:22:34,791","00:22:36,416","Well, we talked about this."
411,"00:22:36,500","00:22:38,791","- We talked about this.
- What are you talking about?"
412,"00:22:38,875","00:22:40,833","- You never said this to me.
- Oh, but I have."
413,"00:22:40,916","00:22:43,291","This is all-new information
I'm getting here."
414,"00:22:43,375","00:22:45,583","Oh, I've said it so many times."
415,"00:22:45,666","00:22:47,041",This is a fob.
416,"00:22:49,125","00:22:51,541",It's like a universal wand.
417,"00:22:51,625","00:22:54,666","Now, instead of needing
a bunch of different wands,"
418,"00:22:54,750","00:22:57,000",we have one fob that does everything.
419,"00:22:57,083","00:23:00,250","What was wrong
with the six wands we already have?"
420,"00:23:00,333","00:23:02,013","They were taking up
the whole coffee table."
421,"00:23:02,041","00:23:02,875",Argh.
422,"00:23:02,958","00:23:05,666","- Just speak a command and press a button.
- Speak a command?"
423,"00:23:05,750","00:23:07,250","- You just have to...
- Go."
424,"00:23:07,333","00:23:08,809","- You gotta just press...
- Go, go, fob."
425,"00:23:08,833","00:23:09,892","- Just press and talk.
- Go!"
426,"00:23:09,916","00:23:12,041","I'm pressing
the living daylights out of it."
427,"00:23:12,125","00:23:14,434","- You just have to...
- But nothing's coming out."
428,"00:23:14,458","00:23:17,125","- Oh, give it to me.
- No, no, no. I got it."

and queen into monsters."

574,"00:34:40,541","00:34:43,041","Who's that?
Did you invite your mother again?"
575,"00:34:43,125","00:34:45,208","No. It's me, Princess Ellian."
576,"00:34:45,291","00:34:46,750",I have your magic fob.
577,"00:34:46,833","00:34:49,083",See? I told you I didn't lose it.
578,"00:34:49,166","00:34:52,166","Listen, things have gotten
really bad here."
579,"00:34:52,250","00:34:53,958","Please, I need you to come back."
580,"00:34:54,041","00:34:58,666","Oh, no. We are not going
anywhere near that crazy place again."
581,"00:34:58,750","00:35:01,750","- Luno, she's in trouble.
- What if I come to you?"
582,"00:35:01,833","00:35:03,041",Will you help me then?
583,"00:35:03,125","00:35:05,916","Ooh, you're very pushy for a princess."
584,"00:35:06,000","00:35:09,333","Oh, of course we will. Won't we?"
585,"00:35:12,541","00:35:16,083","Oh, fine. But good luck
finding a frog at this hour."
586,"00:35:16,166","00:35:17,833","Use the fob, Princess."
587,"00:35:17,916","00:35:21,500","It'll bring you directly to our home
in the Dark Forest of Eternal Darkness."
588,"00:35:21,583","00:35:24,291","The order is given.
Move the monsters out."
589,"00:35:24,375","00:35:26,625",Thank you both so much.
590,"00:35:30,791","00:35:31,791",Soldiers!
591,"00:35:32,208","00:35:34,166","- Put down your weapons.
- Princess?"
592,"00:35:34,250","00:35:36,083",I said drop 'em.
593,"00:35:38,250","00:35:39,083",What the...?
594,"00:35:39,166","00:35:40,625","- Ugh.
- Ugh."
595,"00:35:40,708","00:35:43,708",Guess we gotta be a bit more specific.
596,"00:35:43,791","00:35:46,208",Uh... Take us to the oracles.
597,"00:35:52,083","00:35:54,375",What's happening?
598,"00:35:54,458","00:35:57,916","I was really hoping for more of
a ""zing and you're there"" type of thing."
599,"00:36:01,083","00:36:03,208","- Hey! Wait for us!
- They're getting away!"
600,"00:36:03,291","00:36:05,125",We need something. Uh...
601,"00:36:05,208","00:36:07,125",A... a carriage! A... a cart!
602,"00:36:07,208","00:36:08,250","Uh, something."
603,"00:36:15,375","00:36:16,375",Oh!
604,"00:36:31,250","00:36:33,250",They're stealing our princess.
605,"00:36:35,875","00:36:37,291",Hurry! Hurry!
606,"00:36:37,375","00:36:38,750",Stop those monsters.
607,"00:36:38,833","00:36:40,250","Soldiers, follow me."
608,"00:36:50,583","00:36:51,583",Princess!
609,"00:37:07,666","00:37:09,750","Flink, here. Stall them."
610,"00:37:30,375","00:37:31,458",Whoa!
611,"00:37:32,458","00:37:33,458",Hey!
612,"00:37:33,958","00:37:35,833","- Wait!
- Hey!"
613,"00:37:36,708","00:37:37,708",Whoa!
614,"00:37:39,666","00:37:41,125",Close the gates!
615,"00:37:41,833","00:37:43,166",Close the gates!
616,"00:37:47,875","00:37:49,000",Oh no.
617,"00:37:52,291","00:37:53,583","Flink, hold the gate!"
618,"00:38:05,750","00:38:06,750",Whoa!
619,"00:38:21,416","00:38:23,416",Whoa.
620,"00:38:27,500","00:38:28,500",Oh no.
621,"00:38:29,750","00:38:31,291","Hey, look alive."
622,"00:38:47,375","00:38:48,375",Heel.
623,"00:38:49,208","00:38:51,208",Sit. Out of the...
624,"00:38:59,375","00:39:00,625",Princess!
625,"00:39:01,625","00:39:03,833",We're trying to rescue you!
626,"00:39:03,916","00:39:06,750","No, thanks! I don't need to be rescued!"
627,"00:39:06,833","00:39:08,208",Why won't she listen?
628,"00:39:08,291","00:39:09,875",Because she's a teenager.
629,"00:39:09,958","00:39:11,791","Now, just get her!"
630,"00:39:14,708","00:39:15,708",Ah!
631,"00:39:17,541","00:39:18,833",Flink?
632,"00:39:23,333","00:39:24,541",Oh no.
633,"00:39:24,625","00:39:26,208","Sorry, Bolinar!"
634,"00:39:26,291","00:39:28,791","Well, I should think so
after all you put me through."
635,"00:39:28,875","00:39:29,708",Bolinar?
636,"00:39:29,791","00:39:32,291","As your trusted counselor,
your esteemed mentor,"
637,"00:39:32,375","00:39:34,125",I implore you to... Whoa!
638,"00:39:34,208","00:39:36,750","What's that hairy thing?
And that hairy thing?"
639,"00:39:37,750","00:39:39,916",No!
640,"00:39:42,541","00:39:46,333","Oh, wait. If I'm in this body,
who's in my body?"
641,"00:39:57,166","00:40:00,125","Oh! No. No, no, no, no, no!"
642,"00:40:00,208","00:40:03,166","Ellian, you have to help me.
I'm a purple rat!"
643,"00:40:03,250","00:40:05,458",Not at the top of my to-do list.
644,"00:40:05,541","00:40:06,958","Oh, what am I gonna do?"
645,"00:40:07,041","00:40:08,166",Get us out of here.
646,"00:40:14,333","00:40:15,625",Whoa!
647,"00:40:23,041","00:40:24,291",Whoa!
648,"00:40:27,875","00:40:28,708",Huh?
649,"00:40:39,458","00:40:42,208",Mom? Dad? You okay?
650,"00:40:42,291","00:40:43,291","Well, I'm not."
651,"00:40:44,166","00:40:45,541",Thank you for asking.
652,"00:40:46,125","00:40:50,083","- We did it. We made it.
- Well, bully for us."
653,"00:40:50,166","00:40:52,833","But meanwhile,
my body is back at the kingdom."
654,"00:40:53,333","00:40:54,875","No! No! No! Please, don't eat me."
655,"00:40:54,958","00:40:56,375","Don't worry, Bolinar."
656,"00:40:56,458","00:40:58,291",The oracles will fix everything.
657,"00:40:58,375","00:41:01,125","Well, how are supposed to find them?"
658,"00:41:01,208","00:41:04,041","Wait, stop. What is that?"
659,"00:41:04,666","00:41:05,708",I smell oregano.
660,"00:41:05,791","00:41:07,666",A dash of basil.
661,"00:41:07,750","00:41:09,750",A delicate sprinkling of rosemary.
662,"00:41:09,833","00:41:11,250",Oh!
663,"00:41:11,333","00:41:12,583",It's pasta fazool.
664,"00:41:12,666","00:41:17,125","Come on. Who would be cooking pasta
in the middle of the Dark Forest?"
665,"00:41:17,208","00:41:18,416",Who? Who?
666,"00:41:35,208","00:41:38,208","What do you think? Should we be
naughty and have garlic bread?"
667,"00:41:38,291","00:41:41,791","Well, we were eaten by a monster,
so I think we deserve it."
668,"00:41:41,875","00:41:44,750","Yay! Because I put it
in the oven 20 minutes ago."
669,"00:41:44,833","00:41:46,708",You're terrible.
670,"00:41:46,791","00:41:48,708",Oh! Company!
671,"00:41:49,416","00:41:51,250","Ah, you're finally here."
672,"00:41:53,541","00:41:56,000",Ugh! She brought those monsters.
673,"00:41:56,083","00:41:57,541",We told her to come.
674,"00:41:57,625","00:42:00,041","It's not like she could
just hire a monster sitter."
675,"00:42:00,125","00:42:02,083","Princess, you made it."
676,"00:42:02,166","00:42:03,291",Whew. Barely.
677,"00:42:03,375","00:42:04,875",But here we are.
678,"00:42:04,958","00:42:09,541","And so sorry about the whole
""my mom eating you"" situation."
679,"00:42:09,625","00:42:11,708","It won't happen again. Will it, Mother?"
680,"00:42:14,375","00:42:16,250",So here's your fob.
681,"00:42:17,125","00:42:18,375",Go ahead.
682,"00:42:18,458","00:42:20,166","- Go ahead?
- Break the spell."
683,"00:42:20,250","00:42:22,333","Oh! No, sorry."
684,"00:42:22,416","00:42:25,791","The fob was just to get you here.
It can't change them back."
685,"00:42:25,875","00:42:27,791","- What?
- But you can, right?"
686,"00:42:27,875","00:42:30,916","- I'm afraid it's not in our skill set.
- But you can change me back?"
687,"00:42:31,000","00:42:33,416",Nuh-uh. You're a body switch.
688,"00:42:33,500","00:42:35,916","You're going to need
your other half to do anything."
689,"00:42:36,916","00:42:38,916","Anyone you might know
who could help my parents?"
690,"00:42:39,000","00:42:41,541",Like a wizard or a sorcerer or a pixie?
691,"00:42:41,625","00:42:44,791","A pixie? What,
you think we all know each other?"
692,"00:42:44,875","00:42:48,083","Like we're all part
of some sort of magical mafia?"
693,"00:42:48,166","00:42:49,226","Oh, sorry, I didn't mean..."
694,"00:42:49,250","00:42:52,791","Though to be fair, there is
that pixie couple we play pinochle with."
695,"00:42:52,875","00:42:54,458",They're not very magical though.
696,"00:42:54,541","00:42:56,416","They're not very good
pinochle players either."
697,"00:42:56,500","00:42:58,041",Bless their hearts.
698,"00:42:58,125","00:43:00,958","So you're telling me
there's no one who can break this spell?"
699,"00:43:01,041","00:43:02,583",We didn't say that.
700,"00:43:02,666","00:43:03,666","Well, then who?"
701,"00:43:03,708","00:43:04,625","- Them.
- Them."
702,"00:43:08,750","00:43:11,541","Them? Are you cuckoo banana cakes?
Look at them."
703,"00:43:11,625","00:43:14,125","Yeah, that's not gonna happen."
704,"00:43:14,208","00:43:17,208","So tell me what to do,
and I'll do it for them."
705,"00:43:17,291","00:43:20,541","That's not how these things work.
Only they can break the spell."
706,"00:43:20,625","00:43:21,458",How?
707,"00:43:21,541","00:43:25,166","Together, they get to embark
on an invigorating quest"
708,"00:43:25,250","00:43:27,625","through the Dark Forest
of Eternal Darkness."
709,"00:43:27,708","00:43:28,875",But there's no path.
710,"00:43:28,958","00:43:30,375",There'll be lights to guide them.
711,"00:43:30,458","00:43:32,833","Mmm, some of the time.
They're very fickle."
712,"00:43:32,916","00:43:34,333","You're messing with us, right?"
713,"00:43:34,416","00:43:38,458","- Discover pathways through mountains.
- With lots of unstable cliffs."
714,"00:43:38,541","00:43:41,291","- Ford new streams.
- Ha! More like deadly rapids."
715,"00:43:41,375","00:43:42,750",Glide across deserts.
716,"00:43:42,833","00:43:45,125","Oy, the heat. And it's not a dry heat."
717,"00:43:45,208","00:43:47,708","Princess! Wait!
You didn't let us finish."
718,"00:43:47,791","00:43:51,041","If what you're saying is true,
I'll never see my parents again."
719,"00:43:51,125","00:43:52,791",It's... it's hopeless.
720,"00:43:56,583","00:43:58,041",Great.
721,"00:43:58,708","00:44:00,250","Oh, poor thing."
722,"00:44:00,333","00:44:03,875","Princess, it's never hopeless."

954,"00:57:20,666","00:57:22,458",Sweet sleep at last.
955,"00:57:22,541","00:57:26,375","No. Bolinar, we can't rest.
We have to get to that next beacon."
956,"00:57:29,666","00:57:31,291",Probably just takes a second.
957,"00:57:36,375","00:57:39,291",And we're on to the next beacon.
958,"00:57:41,000","00:57:42,666","Uh, beacon."
959,"00:57:43,166","00:57:44,583",Show me the beacon.
960,"00:57:45,166","00:57:47,166","Uh, bring me the beacon."
961,"00:57:47,750","00:57:49,375","Beacon for four, please."
962,"00:57:50,208","00:57:52,000",Can I get a beacon up in here?
963,"00:57:57,041","00:57:58,375",Where is it?
964,"00:58:07,208","00:58:10,708","What about my name?
Do you remember my name?"
965,"00:58:11,666","00:58:12,500",Mm.
966,"00:58:12,583","00:58:13,583",I know.
967,"00:58:14,375","00:58:16,083",Is it Cake Girl?
968,"00:58:16,166","00:58:19,083","No, Dad. It's not Cake Girl."
969,"00:58:20,458","00:58:21,875",Where is that light?
970,"00:58:23,875","00:58:25,041",I see a light.
971,"00:58:25,125","00:58:27,291",You do? Where? Where is it?
972,"00:58:29,375","00:58:31,000","Those are stars, Mom."
973,"00:58:31,083","00:58:32,083",Mm.
974,"00:58:32,166","00:58:33,166",Pretty.
975,"00:58:33,500","00:58:35,708","Yeah. They are, aren't they?"

1014,"01:01:21,666","01:01:22,750",They stopped here.
1015,"01:01:24,416","01:01:26,333",Looks like they spent the night.
1016,"01:01:27,333","01:01:30,041","Oh, I'm so worried about her, General."
1017,"01:01:30,125","01:01:32,750",We've got to find the princess.
1018,"01:01:33,375","01:01:34,791",And soon.
1019,"01:01:35,583","01:01:38,208",What is that noise?
1020,"01:01:39,625","01:01:40,625",Bolinar.
1021,"01:01:41,833","01:01:43,250",Now what are you eating?
1022,"01:01:44,208","01:01:45,458",That's disgusting.
1023,"01:01:46,458","01:01:47,458",Wait a minute.
1024,"01:01:49,791","01:01:51,041",It's a trail
1025,"01:01:51,625","01:01:52,708",of nuts.
1026,"01:01:53,250","01:01:55,125",Bolinar's found their trail.
1027,"01:01:55,208","01:01:56,416","Brilliant, Minister."

a thorough flyover of that area."
1029,"01:02:01,833","01:02:03,958",How do you make more money than me?
1030,"01:02:11,625","01:02:13,416","- Ellian.
- Ellian."
1031,"01:02:13,500","01:02:15,041",Ellian.
1032,"01:02:15,125","01:02:17,333","I like this name, Ellian."
1033,"01:02:17,416","01:02:20,291","Okay, you got my name."
1034,"01:02:20,375","01:02:22,250",Great. Now listen.
1035,"01:02:22,333","01:02:25,958","You are my parents,
and I am your daughter."
1036,"01:02:26,041","01:02:28,666","You are my parents, and I am your dogger."
1037,"01:02:28,750","01:02:31,208","No, I'm your daughter."
1038,"01:02:31,291","01:02:33,291",Look! There it is!
1039,"01:02:37,041","01:02:39,416","Well, whose dogger am I?"
1040,"01:02:39,500","01:02:40,583",No one's.
1041,"01:02:40,666","01:02:41,541",Oh.
1042,"01:02:41,625","01:02:45,041","- It's okay because you're my dad.
- And you are my dogger."
1043,"01:02:45,125","01:02:46,958","Yes, exactly."
1044,"01:02:47,041","01:02:48,708",And purple rat is my dogger.
1045,"01:02:48,791","01:02:51,791",No. Purple rat is not your daughter.
1046,"01:02:51,875","01:02:54,083",He's also not a purple rat.
1047,"01:02:54,166","01:02:56,541","- You rat.
- Huh?"
1048,"01:02:57,125","01:02:59,041","- I am confused.
- You're breadcrumbing."
1049,"01:02:59,125","01:03:01,166","- You're leaving a trail.
- No, I'm not."
1050,"01:03:01,250","01:03:04,750","\an8- You're gonna lead the soldiers to us.
- You really think so?"
1051,"01:03:06,250","01:03:07,291","- Okay.
- No."
1052,"01:03:07,375","01:03:10,375",No more schemes. No more trails.
1053,"01:03:10,458","01:03:12,250",We are getting to that beacon.
1054,"01:03:12,333","01:03:15,541","The only question is
can I trust you to get there on your feet,"
1055,"01:03:15,625","01:03:18,500","or am I going to have to
get Mom to carry you in her mouth?"
1056,"01:03:18,583","01:03:22,333","- I choose mouth.
- You can trust me. I'm a team player."
1057,"01:03:23,000","01:03:24,875","Yeah, but which team?"
1058,"01:03:28,958","01:03:30,517","- Wh... what's happening?
- We're sinking."
1059,"01:03:30,541","01:03:35,333","- I know we're sinking. Why are we sinking?
- Well, how should I know? Just save me."
1060,"01:03:39,500","01:03:42,000","I have sand
where there should not be sand."
1061,"01:03:42,083","01:03:43,958",That's why I like rocks.
1062,"01:03:47,083","01:03:49,083","Quick, Dad, get to a rock."
1063,"01:03:51,500","01:03:53,791",Oh.
1064,"01:04:02,958","01:04:04,291","Okay, here's the deal."
1065,"01:04:04,375","01:04:07,958","To get across this thing without drowning,
we need to stay in the light."
1066,"01:04:09,000","01:04:12,125","No. There are too many sky balls.
It's too dangerous."
1067,"01:04:12,208","01:04:15,333","We will go that way
on hard, safe green land."
1068,"01:04:17,041","01:04:19,500","Mom, that's so far."
1069,"01:04:19,583","01:04:22,166","No, we have to go straight.
Faster this way."
1070,"01:04:22,250","01:04:23,500","Right, Ellian?"
1071,"01:04:23,583","01:04:26,083","It's a faster way to die.
Tell him, Ellian."
1072,"01:04:26,166","01:04:29,000","We won't die if we are fast.
Ellian, let's go."
1073,"01:04:29,083","01:04:31,125","Dad, we all have to agree on a plan."
1074,"01:04:31,208","01:04:34,041","- We did. Mine.
- Dad, would you just stop?"
1075,"01:04:34,125","01:04:37,208","- Ellian agree with monster woman?
- I didn't say that."
1076,"01:04:37,291","01:04:38,916",You don't agree with me?
1077,"01:04:39,000","01:04:40,680",I didn't say that either.
1078,"01:04:40,708","01:04:43,125","- Ellian agree with me.
- Dad."
1079,"01:04:43,208","01:04:45,708",Why does Ellian agree with monster man?
1080,"01:04:45,791","01:04:49,041","- Wait, what?
- Ellian likes monster man more than Mom?"
1081,"01:04:49,125","01:04:51,458","- Yes.
- No. Don't put me in the middle."
1082,"01:04:51,541","01:04:53,166","The darkness, it's coming!"
1083,"01:04:56,833","01:04:58,875","\an8- Oh no.
- They found us."
1084,"01:05:01,291","01:05:02,291",That's my armor.
1085,"01:05:03,041","01:05:04,166",That's my body.
1086,"01:05:05,166","01:05:07,458",That's my body in my armor.
1087,"01:05:08,375","01:05:10,541","- Come on.
- But... but... but my body!"
1088,"01:05:10,625","01:05:13,291","- Why are you always right?
- Why do you never listen?"
1089,"01:05:13,375","01:05:14,875",This isn't the time.
1090,"01:05:16,166","01:05:17,250",Move out!
1091,"01:05:26,083","01:05:29,500","- Ellian, tell her she's wrong.
- No, Ellian, tell him he's wrong."
1092,"01:05:29,583","01:05:32,666","Mom, Dad, this isn't fair."
1093,"01:05:39,083","01:05:41,333",Halt! Retreat to solid ground!
1094,"01:05:43,458","01:05:46,083","We'd be on the other side now
if we'd gone my way."
1095,"01:05:46,166","01:05:47,958","No, if we'd gone my way."
1096,"01:05:48,041","01:05:50,666","- This is your way.
- Why do you always do this?"
1097,"01:05:50,750","01:05:53,833","- Ellian, tell her I'm right.
- Ellian would be safer my way."
1098,"01:05:53,916","01:05:55,500","No, Ellian would be safer with me."
1099,"01:05:55,583","01:05:57,833","- Don't make me choose between you.
- No, you..."
1100,"01:06:11,666","01:06:13,146",Ellian would be safer my way.
1101,"01:06:13,208","01:06:15,666","- No, Ellian would be safer with...
- Dad! Dad!"
1102,"01:06:15,750","01:06:17,583","- Can you get us over there?
- Huh?"
1103,"01:06:19,541","01:06:21,208","Yes. Yes, I can do that."
1104,"01:06:29,250","01:06:31,041",Left. Left.
1105,"01:06:37,416","01:06:38,416",Whoa.
1106,"01:06:39,708","01:06:41,125",Oh no!
1107,"01:06:41,625","01:06:44,458","- Mom, can you carry me over there?

1108,"01:06:59,333","01:07:00,333",No!
1109,"01:07:47,708","01:07:50,083","We've gotta get there without being seen.
But how?"
1110,"01:07:52,291","01:07:53,916",Take her. I'll hold them off.
1111,"01:07:54,000","01:07:55,750",No. She's safer with you.
1112,"01:07:55,833","01:07:56,833",I have an idea.
1113,"01:08:12,875","01:08:15,083",Wha...? Where did they go?
1114,"01:08:18,333","01:08:19,666","Nothing here, General."
1115,"01:08:19,750","01:08:21,166",Search the other side.
1116,"01:08:22,000","01:08:23,541",They can't have gone far.

1118,"01:08:27,541","01:08:31,041","\an8There goes my body,
riding away with the army."
1119,"01:08:31,125","01:08:34,458","What if the oracles were wrong?
Or the lake doesn't work?"
1120,"01:08:34,541","01:08:38,875","What if we're all stuck like this forever?
Oh, things couldn't get any worse."
1121,"01:08:38,958","01:08:40,041",My body.
1122,"01:08:40,125","01:08:42,250",My beautiful body.

1124,"01:08:46,583","01:08:48,083","- Yes.
- Well, come on."
1125,"01:08:48,166","01:08:51,250","Try to keep up.
We all have to get to the Lake of Light..."

1130,"01:09:12,791","01:09:14,458","Oh, they're flinks."
1131,"01:09:14,541","01:09:16,291",Maybe they can help us.
