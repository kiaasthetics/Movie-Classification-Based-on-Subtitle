2,"00:00:42,199","00:00:46,202","Ah, so satisfied drinking."
3,"00:00:46,203","00:00:50,164","Ah, so lazy to go home."
4,"00:00:50,165","00:00:52,458","Just stay overnight, Suneo."
5,"00:00:52,501","00:00:54,502","But Dekisugi also drank a lot, right?"
6,"00:00:54,503","00:00:57,004","I use the ""Wake Up Soon""
gadget so I'm not drunk."
7,"00:00:57,005","00:00:57,838",Me too.
8,"00:00:57,839","00:01:01,050","Haha, you two are really boring."
9,"00:01:01,051","00:01:04,136",Why drink if you wake up quickly?
10,"00:01:04,930","00:01:08,224","Goodbye, Nobita!
Don't get lost on the road, OK."
11,"00:01:08,225","00:01:09,517","Okay, Gian."
12,"00:01:09,518","00:01:14,522","Yeah, but he's on auto-drive,
so there's no way to get lost."
13,"00:01:14,523","00:01:16,649","That's right, hahaha."
14,"00:01:18,276","00:01:20,194","Sorry, I can't come tomorrow."
15,"00:01:20,195","00:01:22,947","There is a sudden work, right?
That can't be help."
16,"00:01:22,948","00:01:25,408","Being an elite person
is indeed difficult, huh."
17,"00:01:25,409","00:01:27,451","Bye, yes."
18,"00:01:27,452","00:01:30,413","Goal: Go home. Go, scooter."
19,"00:01:30,414","00:01:33,040","Tomorrow, don't be late, you know!"
20,"00:01:33,041","00:01:34,542",I know too!
21,"00:01:37,212","00:01:41,048","Finally tomorrow comes the day.
His wedding day."
22,"00:01:41,466","00:01:43,843",Even though he is just Nobita.
23,"00:01:58,859","00:02:00,192",Doraemon...
24,"00:02:30,474","00:02:34,602","We'll see the wedding
day next time, shall we?"
25,"00:02:34,603","00:02:38,105",Okay. Let's hurry back to our times.
26,"00:02:38,106","00:02:41,859",I also want to meet Shizuka at my dinner.
27,"00:03:19,314","00:03:22,233","Birthday, birthday!"
28,"00:03:22,234","00:03:25,444","I am home!
Mom, what's for lunch today?"
29,"00:03:25,445","00:03:27,530",Nobita!
30,"00:03:27,906","00:03:31,784",I found this in your desk drawer!
31,"00:03:32,744","00:03:36,205",Can't we talk about this later?
32,"00:03:36,206","00:03:37,289",Today it's...
33,"00:03:37,290","00:03:38,791",It is enough!
34,"00:03:38,792","00:03:42,753","I'm not angry because you got zero points,
but because you hid this paper!"
35,"00:03:42,754","00:03:45,673","Mom didn't teach you
to be a child like that!"
36,"00:03:45,674","00:03:50,427","Why do you have to be mad
about this on summer vacation?"
37,"00:03:50,428","00:03:52,638",How embarrassing it really is.
38,"00:03:57,352","00:03:59,728","Today is bad too, huh."
39,"00:03:59,729","00:04:01,939","Even though you don't
have to be that angry."
40,"00:04:01,940","00:04:06,402","Nothing can be done, right?
Because you're the one at fault."
41,"00:04:07,529","00:04:09,655",But today is my birthday.
42,"00:04:11,241","00:04:14,952","Could it be...
Oh, yeah. It must be!"
43,"00:04:14,953","00:04:18,037","Hah? What have you
been talking about earlier?"
44,"00:04:18,038","00:04:20,117","I am not the biological
child of this family."
45,"00:04:20,129","00:04:22,084","They must have picked
me up from somewhere."
46,"00:04:22,085","00:04:24,920","Hahaha, how stupid."
47,"00:04:24,921","00:04:28,132","If I were their real child,
Mother wouldn't speak that badly!"
48,"00:04:28,133","00:04:31,844","After all, if I really am their son,
why did they name me Nobita?"
49,"00:04:31,845","00:04:33,971","Isn't that a common name, huh?"
50,"00:04:33,972","00:04:36,473",I want a cooler name!
51,"00:04:36,474","00:04:44,273","Ah, where is my biological mother?"
52,"00:04:44,274","00:04:46,233",You're talking ridiculous.
53,"00:04:47,110","00:04:49,737","What are you doing up there, Doraemon?"
54,"00:04:49,738","00:04:53,032","Oh, I'm checking my magic gadgets."
55,"00:04:53,033","00:04:58,996","If the floor is messy, so I use this
Gravity Paint to work on the ceiling."
56,"00:04:58,997","00:05:02,458","Now, lots of it, huh."
57,"00:05:02,459","00:05:05,809","Nobita, don't hold it
carelessly, you know. I just"
58,"00:05:05,821","00:05:09,381","want to test whether these
gadgets are damaged or not."
59,"00:05:09,382","00:05:11,884","Uh, don't touch it carelessly!"
60,"00:05:11,885","00:05:13,010",What is that?
61,"00:05:13,011","00:05:16,263","This is the ""Stick of Forgetfulness""."
62,"00:05:16,264","00:05:20,267","If we use this stick, we can
forget what happened before."
63,"00:05:20,268","00:05:23,743","Eh?! If you hit Mom
using that stick earlier,"
64,"00:05:23,755","00:05:26,649","she doesn't have
to be angry like that."
65,"00:05:26,650","00:05:29,652","I wont use this wand
for something like that!"
66,"00:05:29,653","00:05:33,280","Don't say that, please.
I want to borrow it."
67,"00:05:33,281","00:05:36,629","Instead of that, you
better study harder,"
68,"00:05:36,641","00:05:40,162","so you don't need to
get another zero score."
69,"00:05:40,163","00:05:42,164",How can I be!?
70,"00:05:45,919","00:05:50,214",See! There is more!
71,"00:05:51,549","00:05:54,301","Already collected a lot, huh."
72,"00:05:54,302","00:05:57,596","Please, lend me that gadget!"
73,"00:05:57,597","00:06:00,391","If not, please hide this in
your magic pocket, please!"
74,"00:06:00,392","00:06:03,102",Cannot!
75,"00:06:03,103","00:06:06,814","How it come to this?
If she see this, surely..."
76,"00:06:08,608","00:06:10,651",This is from the future department store.
77,"00:06:12,195","00:06:14,321",What is that?
78,"00:06:14,322","00:06:19,660","Sometimes, they like to send
sample items like this one."
79,"00:06:19,661","00:06:21,829","Oh, I see?"
80,"00:06:23,164","00:06:25,082",Let us see
81,"00:06:25,083","00:06:27,126",Soul Swapping Ropes?
82,"00:06:27,127","00:06:29,086","Wait, again, you just grabbed it!"
83,"00:06:29,087","00:06:30,087",Changing.
84,"00:06:40,724","00:06:42,599",Exchange completed.
85,"00:06:42,600","00:06:46,729","Whoa, what is this? Very weird!"
86,"00:06:46,730","00:06:50,858","So this rope can be used to turn us into
someone else who also holds this rope."
87,"00:06:50,859","00:06:55,028",I became Doraemon!
88,"00:06:55,029","00:07:00,159","Hm, hm, so that's how it is.
If we use the rope one more time..."
89,"00:07:00,160","00:07:01,285",Back to normal.
90,"00:07:05,832","00:07:07,541","Oh, so this is it!"
91,"00:07:10,503","00:07:16,008","If so, can we not take it back one more
time, so I won't be nagged by Mother?"
92,"00:07:16,009","00:07:17,801",Don't talk carelessly!
93,"00:07:17,802","00:07:19,303","You really can't, can you?"
94,"00:07:22,182","00:07:26,602",Nobita! Nobita? Nobita!
95,"00:07:27,896","00:07:29,396","Oh, is that so?"
96,"00:07:29,397","00:07:31,064",Are you alright?
97,"00:07:32,025","00:07:34,902","Hahaha, it worked!"
98,"00:07:34,903","00:07:37,613",Are you alright? Nobita!
99,"00:07:37,614","00:07:39,239","Yes, I'm fine."
100,"00:07:40,074","00:07:43,577",I have to hurry and save both of us.
101,"00:07:43,578","00:07:46,455",Nobita! Nobita!
102,"00:07:50,794","00:07:54,671",Where the hell is he?
103,"00:07:55,799","00:07:59,051",Eh? Me why?
104,"00:07:59,052","00:08:02,554","Suddenly they drove me
here on a time machine."
105,"00:08:02,555","00:08:03,972",Who?
106,"00:08:03,973","00:08:05,933",You and I!
107,"00:08:05,934","00:08:11,522","Hey Nobita, I do not understand
at all what you are talking about."
108,"00:08:11,606","00:08:15,442",But I can only. Say that.
109,"00:08:15,443","00:08:19,071","Hm, I don't understand."
110,"00:08:19,072","00:08:22,074",Looks like something happened somewhere.
111,"00:08:22,075","00:08:26,495","Yeah, but now I'm here,
so no problem, right?"
112,"00:08:26,496","00:08:30,415","Really, you are so relaxed!"
113,"00:08:30,416","00:08:32,584",What's more important is this!
114,"00:08:32,585","00:08:35,586","We have to find a place
to hide, so it won't be found!"
115,"00:08:35,587","00:08:40,050","Rather than that, wouldn't it
be easier if you just studied?"
116,"00:08:40,051","00:08:42,802","You are very talkative, Doraemon."
117,"00:08:42,803","00:08:46,223","Nobita, go shopping for a while."
118,"00:08:46,224","00:08:47,599",It's Mother!
119,"00:08:47,600","00:08:49,935",There is something that I want you to buy.
120,"00:08:54,691","00:08:57,860","Just recently, mom said you too much."
121,"00:09:02,740","00:09:05,158",Eh? Very weird.
122,"00:09:06,244","00:09:10,205",I thought he was here. Where did he go?
123,"00:09:14,043","00:09:16,211",It's very dangerous.
124,"00:09:17,505","00:09:20,799","Oh, I found a great place!"
125,"00:09:22,552","00:09:24,553",This way it's safe.
126,"00:09:24,554","00:09:27,055",Oh? It's..
127,"00:09:27,140","00:09:30,934","Wow, I missed you so much!"
128,"00:09:31,728","00:09:34,897","This teddy bear that I
loved when I was little."
129,"00:09:34,898","00:09:37,399","Lots of patches, huh?"
130,"00:09:37,400","00:09:40,194","Yes, Grandma fixed this."
131,"00:09:40,195","00:09:42,279",You have Grandma?
132,"00:09:42,280","00:09:45,115",She died when I was in kindergarten.
133,"00:09:57,545","00:09:58,712",This is it!
134,"00:09:58,796","00:10:02,299","The person who's Nobita hugging, right?"
135,"00:10:02,300","00:10:05,344","Looks like the person
is very friendly, huh."
136,"00:10:05,345","00:10:09,556",Grandma always spoiled me.
137,"00:10:18,942","00:10:23,695",Gian... Gian broke my doll!
138,"00:10:23,696","00:10:28,533","Wow, what a pity."
139,"00:10:35,959","00:10:40,212","This, in this way, the
bear is no longer sick."
140,"00:10:40,213","00:10:41,588",Grandma!
141,"00:10:42,715","00:10:44,675","Whoa, walah..."
142,"00:10:44,676","00:10:48,470",Nobita is really a spoiled child.
143,"00:11:11,619","00:11:14,641","So you've been whiny and
spoiled from then on, huh?"
144,"00:11:15,665","00:11:19,626","What I want to talk about is
Grandma's kindness and warmth!"
145,"00:11:19,627","00:11:21,545","Listen carefully, please!"
146,"00:11:21,546","00:11:23,505",Sorry Sorry!
147,"00:11:33,766","00:11:36,768","Hah? Why, Nobita?"
148,"00:11:38,730","00:11:40,147",I want to meet...
149,"00:11:40,148","00:11:41,023",Hah?
150,"00:11:41,024","00:11:45,235",I want to see Grandma one more time!
151,"00:11:45,236","00:11:47,738",If you say that too..
152,"00:11:47,739","00:11:51,408","Oh yes! If we use a time
machine, we can go back in time."
153,"00:11:51,409","00:11:53,160",Better not.
154,"00:11:53,161","00:11:53,952",Why not?
155,"00:11:54,037","00:11:58,040","If Grandma saw that you suddenly became
an adult, what do you think would happen?"
156,"00:11:58,041","00:12:00,667","Surely he will be
shocked and fall and slip!"
157,"00:12:00,668","00:12:02,794","If we talk carefully, she will understand!"
158,"00:12:02,795","00:12:05,672",You think you can understand time machine!?
159,"00:12:08,342","00:12:09,926","But, but..."
160,"00:12:11,554","00:12:15,724",Oh yes! How about we just look from afar?
161,"00:12:15,725","00:12:17,768",We can hide somewhere.
162,"00:12:21,022","00:12:23,398","After seeing her for a while,
come back straight home, huh?"
163,"00:12:23,399","00:12:24,691",Hooray!
164,"00:12:25,568","00:12:26,568",Let's go!
165,"00:12:33,576","00:12:35,827",Wait a minute!
166,"00:12:37,205","00:12:39,915",We go back to when I was 3 years old.
167,"00:12:43,461","00:12:45,921","We're leaving, here."
168,"00:12:45,922","00:12:46,671",Okay!
169,"00:13:03,106","00:13:07,192","Wow, I missed you so
much! Home in the past!"
170,"00:13:08,361","00:13:10,112",There's still a litter box!
171,"00:13:10,822","00:13:12,739","Oh, Persimmon fruit tree!"
172,"00:13:13,950","00:13:16,284","Two years ago, this tree was cut down."
173,"00:13:16,285","00:13:21,123","Nobita, if anyone sees us it could be
dangerous. Hurry and look at Grandma!"
174,"00:13:22,625","00:13:23,917",Oh yes.
175,"00:13:25,128","00:13:28,839",Grandma is always in this room.
176,"00:13:28,840","00:13:32,008","Remember, yes. Well only see her from afar."
177,"00:13:42,520","00:13:44,020",You know?
178,"00:13:44,021","00:13:47,232",Nothing. What's on the second floor?
179,"00:14:03,583","00:14:09,004",This door has always been jammed.
180,"00:14:09,005","00:14:11,298","If it can't be pulled, try to push it."
181,"00:14:13,050","00:14:15,010",Who are you?
182,"00:14:16,220","00:14:19,848","Now, so young!"
183,"00:14:19,849","00:14:20,932",Is it true?
184,"00:14:20,933","00:14:24,686","But 7 years later, her face
became covered with wrinkles."
185,"00:14:24,687","00:14:25,562",Yes yes.
186,"00:14:27,064","00:14:29,941","What the hell are you guys going
into someone's house! Get out there!"
187,"00:14:34,030","00:14:36,239",Even though it's me. Doesn't she know?
188,"00:14:36,240","00:14:38,825",How could she possibly know?
189,"00:14:40,536","00:14:43,830",Looks like Grandma went out.
190,"00:14:46,459","00:14:48,710",That was me when I was 3 years old!
191,"00:14:48,711","00:14:52,964",How cute. The one now isn't cute at all.
192,"00:14:52,965","00:14:54,466",What the heck?
193,"00:15:02,016","00:15:04,559","Nobita, don't cry."
194,"00:15:04,560","00:15:06,728",It's Shizuka!
195,"00:15:06,729","00:15:08,855",Let's play house.
196,"00:15:10,733","00:15:13,360","Come on, I'll take you home."
197,"00:15:17,698","00:15:20,283","Nobita is very whiny, huh."
198,"00:15:22,745","00:15:26,248",I took the candy.
199,"00:15:30,378","00:15:32,254",Why are you making fun of me?
200,"00:15:32,255","00:15:34,172",Stop it. They're just kids!
201,"00:15:34,257","00:15:37,717",Yesterday they pushed me down at school!
202,"00:15:37,718","00:15:40,178",Don't mix the past with the present!
203,"00:15:47,895","00:15:49,437",Grandma!
204,"00:16:02,785","00:16:05,787",Grandma is alive...
205,"00:16:05,788","00:16:07,289",Grandma is alive... Grandma is walking...
206,"00:16:15,673","00:16:18,800","Dad, go to work first, okay."
207,"00:16:18,801","00:16:21,678","Okay, be careful."
208,"00:16:22,430","00:16:23,888",Here's your lunch.
209,"00:16:23,889","00:16:25,015",Thank you.
210,"00:16:25,016","00:16:32,105","Wow, wow...
Nobita and Shizuka are very close, huh."
211,"00:16:32,106","00:16:33,023",Grandma!
212,"00:16:34,317","00:16:36,318","Have you bought fireworks, haven't you?"
213,"00:16:36,819","00:16:41,823","Forgive me. Grandma has
been around to all the toy stores."
214,"00:16:42,908","00:16:46,953",But they only sell fireworks in summer.
215,"00:16:46,954","00:16:48,955","Don't want, don't want!"
216,"00:16:48,956","00:16:50,498",Forgive me.
217,"00:16:50,499","00:16:52,584","You don't sulk like that, please."
218,"00:16:52,585","00:16:55,003",I want fireworks!
219,"00:16:55,004","00:16:57,714","Yes, sorry, yes."
220,"00:16:57,715","00:17:02,052",Shut up! I hate Grandma! Get in the house!
221,"00:17:02,053","00:17:03,428",Yes yes.
222,"00:17:07,933","00:17:10,226",I don't like Nobita like that!
223,"00:17:16,317","00:17:19,361","Hey, me! Don't be so
mean to Grandma, please!"
224,"00:17:25,326","00:17:27,160",What are you doing?
225,"00:17:28,371","00:17:30,872",Why are you teasing my son?
226,"00:17:32,666","00:17:38,129","Um, er... all of this has a reason..."
227,"00:17:38,130","00:17:39,631",Reason?
228,"00:17:41,217","00:17:44,636",Actually I am Nobita.
229,"00:17:45,513","00:17:47,639","Nobita is this kid, you know."
230,"00:17:47,640","00:17:52,811","No, I'm from the future..."
231,"00:17:52,812","00:17:54,145",What a pity...
232,"00:17:55,147","00:17:56,898",What a freak.
233,"00:17:57,733","00:18:01,528",That's not it... Wait!
234,"00:18:02,822","00:18:06,116",See? How could they believe.
235,"00:18:06,117","00:18:10,912","Satisfied, right?
You saw Grandma, let's go home."
236,"00:18:18,546","00:18:21,214","Okay, let's go."
237,"00:18:21,215","00:18:22,632",Once again!
238,"00:18:29,724","00:18:32,517","Ah, you were that weird kid earlier!"
239,"00:18:32,518","00:18:33,768",Mother!
240,"00:18:38,232","00:18:40,066",Is he really here?
241,"00:18:40,067","00:18:42,360","Geez, to enter the house."
242,"00:18:42,445","00:18:44,237",How scary.
243,"00:18:44,238","00:18:45,447","Here, here."
244,"00:18:47,533","00:18:49,951",Whose child is he?
245,"00:18:53,622","00:18:58,793","Grandma, did a strange
child come into this room?"
246,"00:18:58,794","00:19:00,462",No.
247,"00:19:01,255","00:19:02,630",Hah?
248,"00:19:04,341","00:19:07,844","Seriously, where is he hiding, huh?"
249,"00:19:07,845","00:19:12,724","How about this? Do I
have to go to the police?"
250,"00:19:14,643","00:19:15,727",Thank you.
251,"00:19:22,985","00:19:26,821","Grandma, don't you suspect me?"
252,"00:19:26,822","00:19:27,822",No.
253,"00:19:30,201","00:19:33,620","Grandma, do you really love Nobita?"
254,"00:19:33,621","00:19:37,123","Yes, of course."
255,"00:19:37,791","00:19:44,214","If possible, Grandma wanted
to always be by his side."
256,"00:19:45,716","00:19:51,179","But no way, huh? Grandma is already old."
257,"00:19:51,263","00:19:54,140",Don't talk so pathetic!
258,"00:19:56,018","00:20:02,774","At the very least, Grandma
wants to see him get to school."
259,"00:20:04,527","00:20:09,113","Seeing him wearing a
backpack and going to school..."
260,"00:20:12,034","00:20:14,327",Want to see it just once.
261,"00:20:20,918","00:20:22,126","Wait a minute, please!"
262,"00:20:26,924","00:20:30,218",I have to wait until when? Damnit!
263,"00:20:31,512","00:20:34,305","Doraemon! Backpack, backpack!"
264,"00:20:34,306","00:20:36,683",What the heck? Backpack?
265,"00:20:36,684","00:20:38,977",I want to get my backpack!
266,"00:20:41,647","00:20:43,523","Backpack, backpack!"
267,"00:20:46,318","00:20:47,944",Just stop it already!
268,"00:20:58,706","00:21:00,331",Grandma.
269,"00:21:01,625","00:21:02,959",Oh...
270,"00:21:02,960","00:21:07,964","Maybe you doesn't
believe it, but I'm Nobita."
271,"00:21:09,216","00:21:12,135",That is true.
272,"00:21:12,136","00:21:16,347",From earlier Grandma thought so too.
273,"00:21:17,099","00:21:20,101","You believe it?
Don't doubt it at all?"
274,"00:21:21,312","00:21:25,815",Who doubts Nobita's talk?
275,"00:21:26,817","00:21:27,984",Grandma!
276,"00:21:32,031","00:21:36,618","There, there. You are so spoiled, huh."
277,"00:21:38,203","00:21:46,502","After seeing you in elementary
school, Grandma thought."
278,"00:21:47,963","00:21:54,218",Grandma wants to see your bride just once.
279,"00:21:57,598","00:22:01,517","I understand, Grandma.
I'll show my bride to you."
280,"00:22:03,228","00:22:05,730","Wait for me, yes, Grandma."
281,"00:22:05,731","00:22:06,731",Nobita.
282,"00:22:06,732","00:22:08,232",Doraemon!
283,"00:22:08,233","00:22:10,735",Grandma believes you!
284,"00:22:10,736","00:22:13,613","Yes! Look, I want to show
Grandma a look at the future."
285,"00:22:15,199","00:22:19,243","But is it alright, making
a promise like that?"
286,"00:22:20,245","00:22:22,997",The future can still change!
287,"00:22:22,998","00:22:26,125","But recently we saw my future, right?"
288,"00:22:26,126","00:22:32,423","We can't say for sure that you
are 100% going to marry Shizuka."
289,"00:22:34,510","00:22:36,761",Oh yes. Time Television!
290,"00:22:36,804","00:22:38,262",Take out Time Television!
291,"00:22:38,263","00:22:40,056",Yes yes.
292,"00:22:41,892","00:22:47,146","The wedding venue was at
the Prince Melon Hotel, right?"
293,"00:22:47,147","00:22:49,399",Is it alright?
294,"00:22:58,325","00:23:00,702","It can't be. Not connected, here."
295,"00:23:00,703","00:23:03,413","If he doesn't come quickly
it could be bad, right?"
296,"00:23:03,414","00:23:06,582","What is Nobita doing, anyway?"
297,"00:23:06,667","00:23:09,502","Ah, that's right!"
298,"00:23:09,503","00:23:12,422",Until the last second it was too late.
299,"00:23:12,423","00:23:14,549",How pathetic.
300,"00:23:14,675","00:23:17,802","He couldn't not have come, could he?"
301,"00:23:17,803","00:23:23,891","But there are stories, where the bride
and groom run away on their wedding day..."
302,"00:23:25,978","00:23:28,062","No way, right?"
303,"00:23:28,063","00:23:33,901","Nobita... Nobita, is everything okay?"
304,"00:23:34,528","00:23:35,737",Grandma!
305,"00:23:35,738","00:23:38,072","Good afternoon, I am Doraemon."
306,"00:23:38,157","00:23:41,325","Yes, good afternoon."
307,"00:23:41,326","00:23:43,703",Doraemon who brought me here.
308,"00:23:43,787","00:23:47,707","If so, thank you, yes, good raccoon."
309,"00:23:49,418","00:23:51,794","I'm not a raccoon, you know."
310,"00:23:51,795","00:23:55,214","Grandma wait a little longer, yes."
311,"00:23:55,215","00:23:57,800","I will definitely meet
Grandma with my bride."
312,"00:23:58,302","00:24:01,471",Isn't it a hassle?
313,"00:24:01,513","00:24:05,808",Grandma has made strange wishes.
314,"00:24:05,809","00:24:11,189",It is okay. I just need a little more time.
315,"00:24:11,190","00:24:13,733","A little bit more! But
there is no problem, really."
316,"00:24:13,734","00:24:19,238","Oh, I see? Then just slow down."
317,"00:24:19,281","00:24:19,822",Okay!
318,"00:24:20,324","00:24:27,330",Grandma will wait here.
319,"00:24:31,710","00:24:34,796",We'll be home soon!
320,"00:24:38,008","00:24:40,092",Let's go to wedding day!
321,"00:24:40,093","00:24:44,931","It's about you, so we don't know
what problem you created this time."
322,"00:25:00,906","00:25:04,534","Ah, it's raining."
323,"00:25:04,535","00:25:06,410","Nobita, hurry up!"
324,"00:25:06,411","00:25:07,203",Okay!
325,"00:25:21,760","00:25:23,678",Let's hide there.
326,"00:25:36,191","00:25:40,027",Maybe he got lost inside the hotel.
327,"00:25:40,028","00:25:42,488",Maybe. Let us find!
328,"00:25:42,573","00:25:43,823","Come on, let's follow them."
329,"00:25:44,575","00:25:45,908",Shizuka!
330,"00:25:46,952","00:25:49,453",I can't just stand by.
331,"00:25:51,206","00:25:52,748",How beautiful!
332,"00:25:52,749","00:25:55,084",Just leave it to us!
333,"00:25:55,085","00:25:56,752",Where's Nobita?
334,"00:25:56,753","00:26:01,007","Sorry, Shizuka. Also sorry to your parents."
335,"00:26:01,008","00:26:04,594",It is okay. We're just worried.
336,"00:26:04,595","00:26:06,512","Let's go there, get closer."
337,"00:26:06,513","00:26:07,597",Okay.
338,"00:26:07,598","00:26:13,227","Where is the boy?
Even though he came out before us."
339,"00:26:13,228","00:26:16,397","As long as there is no accident, it's okay."
340,"00:26:16,398","00:26:19,609",But that kid was so careless.
341,"00:26:19,610","00:26:24,655","There is currently no news of
any accidents around here at all."
342,"00:26:27,034","00:26:31,245","I wonder why, Nobita?"
343,"00:26:32,039","00:26:36,751","Um, it looks like you guys are worried."
344,"00:26:36,752","00:26:39,420",But the time is near...
345,"00:26:40,756","00:26:43,925","Geez, why didn't he come?"
346,"00:26:43,926","00:26:47,011","So it's true. He didn't have
confidence in himself, so he ran away."
347,"00:26:47,012","00:26:48,846",It can't be that!
348,"00:26:51,516","00:26:53,851",Nobita will definitely come!
349,"00:26:59,733","00:27:03,945","What is this? How about this?
Troublesome for everyone like this..."
350,"00:27:03,946","00:27:09,617","Will the marriage be canceled?
Do something, please, Doraemon!"
351,"00:27:09,618","00:27:11,911","Only you can replace, right?"
352,"00:27:13,163","00:27:16,165","Before you have to wear
this and become an adult."
353,"00:27:16,166","00:27:18,459","No, no, I can't!"
354,"00:27:18,460","00:27:20,586",There is only this way!
355,"00:27:20,587","00:27:22,254",I can't!
356,"00:27:22,255","00:27:23,631",Get caught!
357,"00:27:31,807","00:27:33,432","I will follow you, really."
358,"00:27:34,226","00:27:37,561",I don't understand anything about marriage!
359,"00:27:37,562","00:27:38,813",Nobita!
360,"00:27:40,065","00:27:43,609",Nobita! What are you doing until this time?
361,"00:27:45,696","00:27:48,698","Nobiita, are you okay? What happened?"
362,"00:27:51,702","00:27:53,703",Um...
363,"00:27:53,704","00:27:58,332","Oh yeah, l-l got lost on the way."
364,"00:28:02,337","00:28:04,297",That's right.
365,"00:28:04,298","00:28:06,132",He really is Nobita.
366,"00:28:07,342","00:28:10,845","Come on, everyone in the
party room. Please enter."
367,"00:28:10,846","00:28:11,929",Please.
368,"00:28:11,930","00:28:13,639","""Small Light""."
369,"00:28:55,766","00:28:57,808","Hey, look at that."
370,"00:29:00,020","00:29:03,773",Nobita's teeth are grinding.
371,"00:29:07,027","00:29:09,320",Is it alright?
372,"00:29:10,739","00:29:12,823","I'm here, really."
373,"00:29:13,992","00:29:16,911",That's very worrying.
374,"00:29:16,912","00:29:19,246","Start, that's it."
375,"00:30:08,672","00:30:16,971","Nobita, do you vow to marry Shizuka
and love her in good times and bad times?"
376,"00:30:16,972","00:30:20,641",Vow to be with her until the end?
377,"00:30:25,605","00:30:28,399","Nobita, do you swear?"
378,"00:30:28,900","00:30:30,025",Are you alright?
379,"00:30:33,405","00:30:36,449","Ah, his head is empty."
380,"00:30:36,450","00:30:38,200",What should I do?
381,"00:30:38,201","00:30:39,034",Oh yes!
382,"00:30:45,792","00:30:47,918","Oh, sorry!"
383,"00:30:50,422","00:30:52,047",It's fine.
384,"00:30:54,134","00:30:57,052",I swear!
385,"00:30:58,430","00:31:00,639",Is it okay if I do it?
386,"00:31:00,640","00:31:03,267","The real one didn't come,
so it can't be helped, right?"
387,"00:31:04,895","00:31:08,481",It feels so weird!
388,"00:31:17,908","00:31:21,285","Now is the time for our bride
and groom to kiss each other."
389,"00:31:21,286","00:31:23,329",Kiss?
390,"00:31:25,916","00:31:29,335",Nobita?
391,"00:31:41,181","00:31:45,184","Wow, all this can be eaten, right?"
392,"00:31:45,185","00:31:49,939","Nobita, you are really relaxed,
after making a fuss like that."
393,"00:31:49,940","00:31:52,441",How delicious!
394,"00:31:53,818","00:31:55,528","Hey, Nobita."
395,"00:31:55,529","00:31:57,821","If you are too excited you
can get caught, you know!"
396,"00:31:57,822","00:31:59,281","Congratulations, yes, Shizuka."
397,"00:31:59,282","00:32:01,116",Thank you.
398,"00:32:05,080","00:32:07,122","Did I catch a cold, okay?"
399,"00:32:09,084","00:32:12,211","Everyone, please pay attention."
400,"00:32:12,212","00:32:17,341","Our bride and groom are
going to cut the cake now."
401,"00:32:17,342","00:32:23,013","First, let's make the
cake here. Please watch it."
402,"00:32:23,014","00:32:25,349","Those who want to see
closely are also allowed."
403,"00:32:25,350","00:32:27,017",Let's go.
404,"00:32:29,646","00:32:33,983",I couldn't believe it had rained suddenly.
405,"00:32:33,984","00:32:38,821","But it's okay. This is a gardening
party room with a see-through roof."
406,"00:32:38,822","00:32:43,242","We are given the use of this room because
the owner is an acquaintance of my father."
407,"00:32:49,749","00:32:51,542",Great! Great!
408,"00:32:57,632","00:33:00,342",Looks delicious.
409,"00:33:01,970","00:33:04,054",Hugh!
410,"00:33:04,055","00:33:10,519","The cake is finished, please cut it."
411,"00:33:15,817","00:33:16,609",'Hah?
412,"00:33:16,610","00:33:17,610",What is wrong?
413,"00:33:17,611","00:33:19,820","There is only one knife, you know."
414,"00:33:19,821","00:33:23,741","What are you saying?
We'll both hold the knife."
415,"00:33:23,742","00:33:26,035","Hehe, that's right, yeah."
416,"00:33:26,036","00:33:29,663","Nobita, cut it quickly!"
417,"00:33:29,664","00:33:36,086","This cake cutting will be the first
activity the couple will do together."
418,"00:33:36,171","00:33:40,132","Nobita, look here, please!"
419,"00:33:41,718","00:33:46,805","Nobita, Shizuka,
congratulations on your marriage."
420,"00:33:46,806","00:33:49,850","Even though you can only
get 0 points in the past..."
421,"00:33:49,893","00:33:55,189","I'm happy you can be a good
man and get married today."
422,"00:33:57,025","00:34:00,944","Now, marriage is really fun, huh..."
423,"00:34:09,079","00:34:11,955","Oh, right, Shizuka became suspicious."
424,"00:34:11,956","00:34:14,416","Eh, really?"
425,"00:34:14,417","00:34:19,922","Now, let us hear the remarks from
our groom, Nobita Nobi."
426,"00:34:21,049","00:34:24,218","Oh, okay, remarks, right?"
427,"00:34:31,017","00:34:32,643",Good afternoon!
428,"00:34:35,480","00:34:38,857",Ah? Why? What is wrong?
429,"00:34:38,858","00:34:43,487","Not good afternoon.
You've thought about the speech, right?"
430,"00:34:43,488","00:34:46,532",Eh? Speech?
431,"00:34:46,533","00:34:51,412","Oh, yeah, so you mean that, huh?"
432,"00:34:52,997","00:34:56,125",Where will I put it?
433,"00:34:56,126","00:34:58,627","I don't know, you know."
434,"00:34:59,838","00:35:03,257","If I'm not mistaken... here, right?"
435,"00:35:03,258","00:35:06,510","No, this is it?"
436,"00:35:06,511","00:35:08,011",There can't be.
437,"00:35:09,764","00:35:11,807",Oh yes!
438,"00:35:11,808","00:35:18,105","Hahaha, how could I forget that...
Looks like I left it in the waiting room."
439,"00:35:18,523","00:35:20,524","I'll take it first, yes!"
440,"00:35:22,569","00:35:26,488","! 11 Looks like our groom
has to get ready first."
441,"00:35:26,489","00:35:28,449",Let's wait.
442,"00:35:31,286","00:35:33,746",We're really sorry...
443,"00:35:35,915","00:35:38,709",The bride and groom are such a pain.
444,"00:35:38,710","00:35:41,044","Wait a minute, give me the mic."
445,"00:35:48,219","00:35:52,639","Everyone! While waiting
for Nobita to return..."
446,"00:35:52,640","00:35:57,978","I, as his best friend,
will sing for all of you."
447,"00:35:58,062","00:36:00,230","Hey... Wait... Sorry, huh..."
448,"00:36:00,231","00:36:02,816","Gian, let's go back to the seats."
449,"00:36:02,817","00:36:04,777","Shut up, leave me alone!"
450,"00:36:04,778","00:36:05,778",Let's just have a drink.
451,"00:36:05,779","00:36:07,821","Music, start!"
452,"00:36:12,577","00:36:15,954","Buttobasu denjarasu!
Am strong and dangerous!"
453,"00:36:16,247","00:36:18,290","Ore Gian!
I am Gian!"
454,"00:36:18,291","00:36:21,335",Ittoushou. Addokkoishou! I beat everyone!
455,"00:36:21,336","00:36:25,088",What are you doing? Gian is singing!
456,"00:36:26,299","00:36:30,803","Even here too, the singing
can break your head!"
457,"00:36:33,097","00:36:36,892","The only way we have
is to find my adult self!"
458,"00:36:36,893","00:36:40,604","At this rate, the wedding
party could be ruined!"
459,"00:36:40,605","00:36:43,857","Nobita, go back quickly!"
460,"00:36:43,858","00:36:46,401","I can't! I don't know
what greeting speech is!"
461,"00:36:46,402","00:36:48,612","You just need to talk
about yourself, right?"
462,"00:36:48,613","00:36:54,493",I can't! We have to find the grown me!
463,"00:37:03,127","00:37:08,173","By the way, isn't the greeting speech
""Good Morning"" or ""Good Afternoon"", huh?"
464,"00:37:08,258","00:37:13,220","In a place like that, greeting
means thanking your parents."
465,"00:37:13,221","00:37:17,849","Be thankful? They Always
get mad when I get 0 points!"
466,"00:37:17,850","00:37:20,561",Impossible impossible!
467,"00:37:20,562","00:37:22,646",You're still talking about that.
468,"00:37:25,817","00:37:29,194",He's nowhere.
469,"00:37:29,195","00:37:32,155","Oh, yeah, let's just use the search stick."
470,"00:37:32,156","00:37:33,490",What is that?
471,"00:37:33,491","00:37:37,035","The stick can be a signpost
for the person we want to find."
472,"00:37:37,036","00:37:39,580","Heh, very practical."
473,"00:37:46,337","00:37:47,045",Why?
474,"00:37:47,463","00:37:50,424",Remember when we came here?
475,"00:37:52,677","00:37:55,345",Tidying up magic gadgets.
476,"00:37:59,934","00:38:04,563","You were in a hurry, I was
panicking too, that's why I missed a lot."
477,"00:38:04,564","00:38:07,524","How about we go back to the
original world and take it first?"
478,"00:38:07,525","00:38:09,443",We don't have time.
479,"00:38:09,444","00:38:11,528",Don’t worry.
480,"00:38:12,405","00:38:15,574","For example, we leave at 2."
481,"00:38:17,702","00:38:21,038","We go back to the origin
and waste 1 hour there."
482,"00:38:21,039","00:38:23,206",Keep going back to the future.
483,"00:38:25,043","00:38:31,048","When we go out we put it in 5
minutes, so it's 2 past 5 o'clock."
484,"00:38:31,049","00:38:34,051",Finally we only waste 5 minutes.
485,"00:38:34,052","00:38:36,928","Doraemon, you are so smart."
486,"00:38:36,929","00:38:44,728","Not really, ah."
487,"00:38:44,729","00:38:46,396",Let's go to the time machine place.
488,"00:38:46,397","00:38:47,105",Okay!
489,"00:39:08,127","00:39:10,045",Ah! That's right...
490,"00:39:10,088","00:39:11,463",There he is!
491,"00:39:11,506","00:39:15,926","Geez, just make people
worry. He didn't fall asleep, right?"
492,"00:39:21,599","00:39:24,017",It is nothing.
493,"00:39:24,018","00:39:25,310",Do not tell me...
494,"00:39:25,311","00:39:28,230",W-Wait! Where are you going?
495,"00:39:28,231","00:39:29,231",Toilet!
496,"00:39:29,232","00:39:31,191",Are you dying?
497,"00:39:31,234","00:39:32,609",Don't talk stupid like that!
498,"00:39:37,240","00:39:38,865",This isn't the one!
499,"00:39:40,118","00:39:41,159",Nothing! Nothing!
500,"00:39:41,160","00:39:42,244",Nothing! Nothing! Nothing!
501,"00:39:42,245","00:39:43,870",Nothing! Nothing! Nothing! Nothing!
502,"00:39:45,081","00:39:47,124",It's not anywhere!
503,"00:39:47,125","00:39:48,542",What happened?
504,"00:39:48,543","00:39:51,128",The time machine was taken by someone!
505,"00:39:51,921","00:39:53,130",By whom?
506,"00:39:53,131","00:39:57,634","There is only one person who
can drive a time machine today."
507,"00:40:00,221","00:40:02,514",Your adult self!
508,"00:40:04,267","00:40:07,936","Geez, haphazardly riding time machine."
509,"00:40:07,937","00:40:12,274","Did he go to another era?
Your adult self."
510,"00:40:12,275","00:40:14,109",But why?
511,"00:40:14,110","00:40:17,529",I do not know? He is you!
512,"00:40:17,530","00:40:19,823",Don't you have any ideas?
513,"00:40:19,907","00:40:23,785","I do not know?
He's me from the future."
514,"00:40:26,789","00:40:32,127","Ah... no him, not you.
Nobita is always like that."
515,"00:40:32,128","00:40:33,420",Forgive me.
516,"00:40:36,549","00:40:37,924",What is wrong?
517,"00:40:39,844","00:40:43,472",So we can't go home from this era?
518,"00:40:46,309","00:40:50,562","This has happened before.
You can do something, right?"
519,"00:40:50,563","00:40:55,609","Everything will be all right, right, Doraemon?
Oh yes! What about the Time Belt?"
520,"00:40:55,610","00:40:57,569",I told you...
521,"00:40:57,570","00:40:59,821",Being tidied up.
522,"00:40:59,822","00:41:03,283","Everything that could help
us get home was left behind."
523,"00:41:04,952","00:41:07,245","How about it, Doraemon?"
524,"00:41:07,246","00:41:11,958","Well, we have to live
in this era like this..."
525,"00:41:24,430","00:41:26,932",am hungry.
526,"00:41:26,933","00:41:30,769","Surely everyone has come
home from the party venue."
527,"00:41:32,605","00:41:35,524",Everything must be messy.
528,"00:41:35,525","00:41:40,237","Of the gadgets here, is there anything that
can be used to return home or not, huh?"
529,"00:41:46,869","00:41:49,996",This is it! We can use this!
530,"00:41:51,999","00:41:54,751","""Soul Time Machine""!"
531,"00:41:54,752","00:41:57,003","""Soul Time Machine""?"
532,"00:41:57,004","00:42:01,383","This gadget will absorb your soul
and send it to you in a different era."
533,"00:42:01,384","00:42:07,305","With this, we can send your
soul to the moment before we left."
534,"00:42:07,306","00:42:10,076","At that time, the time
machine was still there, so you"
535,"00:42:10,088","00:42:12,769","could use the time machine
and come back here, right?"
536,"00:42:14,397","00:42:17,023","If you try it, you will understand."
537,"00:42:26,158","00:42:28,034","Please, yes, Nobita!"
538,"00:42:49,557","00:42:55,187","Hey, if we do it one more time, don't
you the one who will be nagged by Mother?"
539,"00:42:55,188","00:42:56,771",Don't talk carelessly!
540,"00:43:04,947","00:43:10,160",Nobita! Nobita! Nobita!
541,"00:43:11,203","00:43:12,829","Oh, so it's like this, huh?"
542,"00:43:12,830","00:43:14,122",Are you alright?
543,"00:43:17,001","00:43:18,335",It worked!
544,"00:43:18,336","00:43:21,046","Are you okay, Nobita?"
545,"00:43:21,047","00:43:23,298",Yes I'm fine.
546,"00:43:23,299","00:43:27,052",I have to hurry and save both of us.
547,"00:43:27,053","00:43:29,763",Nobita? Nobita!
548,"00:43:35,811","00:43:37,270",Is he all right?
549,"00:43:39,398","00:43:42,734",Looks like he's taking a nap.
550,"00:43:42,735","00:43:46,529","This is indeed hobby, hahaha."
551,"00:43:46,530","00:43:51,451","Ah, what a mess."
552,"00:43:53,329","00:43:55,538",Doraemon!
553,"00:43:57,041","00:43:58,458",Nobita!
554,"00:43:58,542","00:44:00,669",I got the time machine!
555,"00:44:08,177","00:44:10,136","Then, let's return it to normal, OK."
556,"00:44:10,137","00:44:10,845",Okay.
557,"00:44:18,938","00:44:20,730",It worked!
558,"00:44:20,731","00:44:23,817",Eh? Me why?
559,"00:44:23,818","00:44:26,236",I have two?
560,"00:44:26,237","00:44:29,030","This is the future, right?"
561,"00:44:29,031","00:44:31,700",Stop it. Do not worry about it.
562,"00:44:31,701","00:44:33,535",What is it?
563,"00:44:33,536","00:44:35,537","Alright, really."
564,"00:44:36,580","00:44:40,834","Hey, why am I suddenly in the future?"
565,"00:44:40,835","00:44:43,795",Why there are two me?
566,"00:44:43,796","00:44:46,172",Do not worry about it.
567,"00:44:46,173","00:44:49,509",How could that be? Please explain!
568,"00:44:54,724","00:44:59,144","Before it got complicated, we
made this Nobita forget about it."
569,"00:44:59,145","00:45:01,521","This forgetful stick is useful too, huh."
570,"00:45:01,522","00:45:05,275",Eh? Why am I here?
571,"00:45:05,276","00:45:07,902","No, don't think about it."
572,"00:45:12,491","00:45:16,494","Duh, where is he?"
573,"00:45:17,496","00:45:24,210","Hah? Me why?
They took me there on a time machine."
574,"00:45:24,211","00:45:25,587",Who?
575,"00:45:26,380","00:45:28,923","This way, we can rest easy."
576,"00:45:28,924","00:45:30,884","Oh, no!"
577,"00:45:30,885","00:45:34,387","Nobita, go shopping for a bit!"
578,"00:45:34,388","00:45:35,680",It's Mother!
579,"00:45:36,724","00:45:39,184",Hurry up and hide here!
580,"00:45:44,523","00:45:47,859","Just recently, mom said too much."
581,"00:45:49,779","00:45:51,863","If you're there, please answer..."
582,"00:45:53,657","00:45:59,871","Well, now... where is
the adult Nobita, huh?"
583,"00:46:13,260","00:46:15,220",What does it mean?
584,"00:46:15,221","00:46:20,058","Nobita who has grown
up may exist in this era."
585,"00:46:55,052","00:46:58,054",I have no reason to meet you guys.
586,"00:46:58,055","00:47:02,016","Especially after I said
that half a year ago."
587,"00:47:02,351","00:47:04,602",Do you want to meet Doraemon?
588,"00:47:04,603","00:47:06,813","No, I don't have to."
589,"00:47:06,814","00:47:12,485","Doraemon is your friend...
my friend when I was little."
590,"00:47:12,820","00:47:16,698",Oh yes!
591,"00:47:16,699","00:47:18,533",What's wrong?
592,"00:47:18,534","00:47:21,995","By the way, why did you
run away from the wedding?"
593,"00:47:21,996","00:47:24,414",Don't you like Shizuka anymore?
594,"00:47:24,415","00:47:27,750","How could that be!
I like her! I really love her!"
595,"00:47:27,751","00:47:32,005","Being able to marry
Shizuka is truly a dream."
596,"00:47:32,006","00:47:33,381",But?
597,"00:47:33,465","00:47:36,718",But what?
598,"00:47:36,719","00:47:40,354","Yesterday, after
drinking with friends and I"
599,"00:47:40,366","00:47:43,850","was alone, I was
thinking about the future."
600,"00:47:44,727","00:47:51,524","Then, I got scared
Afraid... Afraid... So scared!"
601,"00:47:51,525","00:47:52,734",Afraid of what?
602,"00:47:53,194","00:47:58,990","Since I'm like this, maybe I
can't make Shizuka happy!"
603,"00:47:58,991","00:48:01,242",Why are you so weak?
604,"00:48:01,243","00:48:06,372","After all, you also know why
Shizuka wanted to marry me, right?"
605,"00:48:06,373","00:48:10,043",She felt that I was unreliable.
606,"00:48:10,377","00:48:15,423","Nobita has not changed at all, huh."
607,"00:48:15,424","00:48:20,428","If we let it go, we don't know
what will happen, I get worried."
608,"00:48:22,514","00:48:24,015",1 understand.
609,"00:48:24,433","00:48:30,897","If she married me for a reason
like that, pity Shizuka herself!"
610,"00:48:32,399","00:48:35,693",She's too kind.
611,"00:48:35,694","00:48:38,404",So that's why you came back to this time?
612,"00:48:38,405","00:48:42,116","At that time, I happened
to go to a public toilet."
613,"00:48:51,627","00:48:54,045",Why is there a time machine here?
614,"00:48:55,256","00:49:01,177","I don't care where the machine
takes me. I just want time to think."
615,"00:49:01,178","00:49:04,190","The reason I return
to this time is because"
616,"00:49:04,202","00:49:07,433","the time machine is
set to return to this time."
617,"00:49:07,434","00:49:10,144",So that's the reason you left the wedding?
618,"00:49:10,145","00:49:14,315","Don't you think you've
been a bother for everyone?"
619,"00:49:14,316","00:49:20,071","Don’t worry. When I got more confident, I
would go back to my wedding party, really."
620,"00:49:20,072","00:49:21,906","If that's the case, I also know..."
621,"00:49:23,117","00:49:25,118","Could it be, have you seen it?"
622,"00:49:25,911","00:49:27,245",I'm not coming back?
623,"00:49:27,329","00:49:29,205",That's why we are looking for you.
624,"00:49:30,291","00:49:32,292",What happened?
625,"00:49:32,293","00:49:33,793",1 don't know!
626,"00:49:33,836","00:49:37,297","When the wedding started, you were gone!"
627,"00:49:37,298","00:49:38,631",Then the wedding?
628,"00:49:38,632","00:49:41,259",I replaced you.
629,"00:49:41,260","00:49:43,678",But in the middle I also ran away.
630,"00:49:43,679","00:49:45,847",The marriage must have gone awry.
631,"00:49:46,974","00:49:48,683",What are you doing?
632,"00:49:48,684","00:49:49,851",But why?
633,"00:49:49,852","00:49:52,353","Suddenly I didn't feel confident, you know."
634,"00:49:54,231","00:49:56,232",So sad?
635,"00:49:56,233","00:50:00,111","Didn't you come back
because of an accident?"
636,"00:50:01,613","00:50:05,283","Then what, then?"
637,"00:50:07,786","00:50:09,746",What kind of accident?!
638,"00:50:22,718","00:50:25,636",Can't you forget Nobita?
639,"00:50:28,223","00:50:31,225",I don't know why he disappeared suddenly.
640,"00:50:31,226","00:50:33,519",Even though he said he liked me.
641,"00:50:33,520","00:50:38,691","Seriously, Nobita. If I find
him, I'll beat him black and blue."
642,"00:50:38,692","00:50:43,237","But I believe, Nobita
will definitely come back."
643,"00:50:43,238","00:50:49,077","And when he comes back, he'll
tell me everything. I believe it."
644,"00:50:49,161","00:50:57,794","I'm sorry, Shizuka! But
understand! I'm doing this for you too!"
645,"00:50:57,795","00:51:00,922",Take out your courage and come back.
646,"00:51:00,923","00:51:04,550","I can not. If time has
passed any minute,..."
647,"00:51:04,551","00:51:10,723","...surely Shizuka would forget
me and meet another man."
648,"00:51:10,724","00:51:15,520","If she forgets me, she can be happy."
649,"00:51:15,521","00:51:19,065","Then, do you want to
see Shizuka's future again?"
650,"00:51:19,066","00:51:28,741","No. I don't want to see
Shizuka happy with another man!"
651,"00:51:28,742","00:51:31,035",How selfish.
652,"00:51:31,036","00:51:38,042","But if she turns out to be unhappy,
I don't want to look anymore!"
653,"00:51:38,043","00:51:39,919",How troublesome this guy is.
654,"00:51:39,920","00:51:42,630",He's you after all.
655,"00:51:42,715","00:51:46,590","Come to think of it, this is
all because you are usually"
656,"00:51:46,602","00:51:50,012","just taking naps, which
is why I became like this."
657,"00:51:50,013","00:51:53,933","Homework is not even
done, and tests can be 0 only."
658,"00:51:53,934","00:51:55,601",Have no confidence anymore.
659,"00:51:55,602","00:51:57,937","Don't blame me, please!"
660,"00:51:57,938","00:52:01,023",Don't fight with yourself!
661,"00:52:02,109","00:52:07,196","Ah, if I could go back to this
time, maybe I could fix things up."
662,"00:52:07,197","00:52:09,240","If you want, it's easy, really."
663,"00:52:11,910","00:52:14,203","""Soul Swapping Ropes""!"
664,"00:52:14,204","00:52:19,500","If you hold this rope,
you can change bodies."
665,"00:52:30,721","00:52:33,014","Why are you so excited?
It's Dangerous, you know."
666,"00:52:33,015","00:52:37,185","Besides, when are you coming
back? Just now you still weren't around."
667,"00:52:37,186","00:52:41,147","Now, how happy. This feeling and that..."
668,"00:52:42,024","00:52:43,274","No, nothing."
669,"00:52:43,317","00:52:44,734","I'll play first, OK!"
670,"00:52:44,735","00:52:46,402","Ah, Nobita, the shopping..."
671,"00:52:48,947","00:52:51,240",It was out suddenly.
672,"00:52:57,915","00:53:02,335","Wow, Gian and the others are still kids."
673,"00:53:02,336","00:53:05,004","Of course, hahaha."
674,"00:53:05,672","00:53:07,799","Hey, how are you?"
675,"00:53:07,800","00:53:10,343","What are you doing, Nobita? Very arrogant."
676,"00:53:10,344","00:53:13,304","Even though you are Nobita,
you really don't hesitate!"
677,"00:53:13,305","00:53:15,056","I also want to play, please."
678,"00:53:15,057","00:53:19,644","Oh, it's the first time you
asked to enter yourself."
679,"00:53:19,645","00:53:20,978","Okay, let's try it."
680,"00:53:21,063","00:53:24,357",You want to play baseball yourself.
681,"00:53:24,358","00:53:28,069","He must have been training hard and finally
become an expert at playing baseball."
682,"00:53:33,158","00:53:35,451",Catch it fast!
683,"00:53:36,370","00:53:39,705","Nobita, you understand, right?"
684,"00:53:43,502","00:53:45,253","Batter, out!"
685,"00:53:51,218","00:53:56,264","Even though he is an adult,
he still hasn't changed at all."
686,"00:53:56,265","00:53:58,099","That's right, yes."
687,"00:54:02,145","00:54:07,149",Nobita! What does this mean?
688,"00:54:07,150","00:54:13,197","You asked yourself to come
in, why did it turn out like this?"
689,"00:54:13,198","00:54:16,033","Oh right, you're angry.
Of course you get angry."
690,"00:54:16,118","00:54:19,245",What did you say?
691,"00:54:19,246","00:54:22,832","We lost because of you, you know!"
692,"00:54:23,834","00:54:26,878","His sense of power
simply couldn't stand it."
693,"00:54:26,879","00:54:29,130",Damn it!
694,"00:54:29,131","00:54:30,882",No kidding!
695,"00:54:32,384","00:54:34,760",This is it! This feeling!
696,"00:54:34,761","00:54:39,515","He looks so happy. Adults
just can't be understood."
697,"00:54:42,019","00:54:46,772","Well, if he's tired, he can
also go home by himself."
698,"00:54:47,774","00:54:53,279","Nobita, with a body like that,
we better enter from the window."
699,"00:54:53,280","00:54:55,865","Yes, that’s right."
700,"00:55:06,043","00:55:10,421","Hey, finally you guys came
home. Where have you been?"
701,"00:55:10,881","00:55:11,714",Who are you?
702,"00:55:11,715","00:55:18,012","Oh, sorry. I'm from the future
department store. My name is Nakameguro."
703,"00:55:18,013","00:55:21,932","Oh, those of you who
like to give us samples."
704,"00:55:21,933","00:55:23,559",Why are you here today?
705,"00:55:23,560","00:55:30,107","Um, about the soul-swaping
rope I sent here..."
706,"00:55:30,108","00:55:31,943",I want to take it back.
707,"00:55:31,944","00:55:34,695",Hah? Is there any problem?
708,"00:55:34,696","00:55:36,197",Of course not!
709,"00:55:36,198","00:55:40,660","That's the gadgets that we choose
carefully from the shop right away..."
710,"00:55:40,661","00:55:43,204",How could there be a problem...
711,"00:55:44,414","00:55:47,208",Then why?
712,"00:55:47,209","00:55:50,836","Um, that... about that.."
713,"00:55:50,837","00:55:54,048","Don’t worry. We'll
definitely return it, really."
714,"00:55:54,049","00:55:56,592","Oh, thank you very much!"
715,"00:55:56,593","00:55:58,719","But wait a minute, okay."
716,"00:55:58,720","00:56:03,140","We just used the rope for Nobita. If they
have exchanged it back, we will return it."
717,"00:56:03,141","00:56:05,476",I'm actually a kid.
718,"00:56:07,229","00:56:08,521",So what?
719,"00:56:08,522","00:56:12,608","H-H-H-How long has it been
since you guys used that rope?"
720,"00:56:12,609","00:56:15,569",Hmm... how many minutes has it been?
721,"00:56:15,779","00:56:19,407","Almost 1 hour, right?"
722,"00:56:19,491","00:56:21,867",W-W-W-W-W-W-W-What!
723,"00:56:21,993","00:56:22,576",Hah?
724,"00:56:22,577","00:56:24,662",This is bad!
725,"00:56:24,663","00:56:27,206",Listen carefully.
726,"00:56:27,207","00:56:32,628","Actually, the gadget has
a slight error in its design..."
727,"00:56:34,631","00:56:38,217","After 1 hour, their
consciousness will disappear?"
728,"00:56:38,218","00:56:40,761",And the memories of both of us...
729,"00:56:40,762","00:56:43,929","If you don't quickly
return to your original"
730,"00:56:43,941","00:56:46,767","self, the memories
will be lost forever."
731,"00:56:46,768","00:56:47,977",Nobita!
732,"00:56:47,978","00:56:49,145","Come on, quickly!"
733,"00:56:52,357","00:56:54,650",W-Where are .you going?
734,"00:56:54,651","00:56:57,278",First of all we ask this gadget.
735,"00:56:57,320","00:57:00,322",Where is the adult Nobita?
736,"00:57:04,703","00:57:06,787",Why can't it?
737,"00:57:06,788","00:57:10,458","What can I do, we just
search from here first."
738,"00:57:15,756","00:57:17,423",Why? What is wrong?
739,"00:57:17,424","00:57:21,844","Could it be... Nobita who has grown
up was not returning to the future.."
740,"00:57:21,845","00:57:24,055","Because he couldn't
go back to the future.,"
741,"00:57:24,473","00:57:25,556",What do you mean?
742,"00:57:25,557","00:57:29,643","If he has lost his memory,
he doesn't know himself, right?"
743,"00:57:31,688","00:57:37,193","Then, my memories in this
era will also be lost, right?"
744,"00:57:37,194","00:57:41,197","It's a shame, but there you have it."
745,"00:57:41,198","00:57:44,492",I don't want that!
746,"00:57:44,493","00:57:46,911","Nobita, wait a minute!"
747,"00:57:56,421","00:58:01,300","Finally I am free from them,
and Suneo are so stubborn."
748,"00:58:01,301","00:58:03,010",Excuse me.
749,"00:58:04,596","00:58:08,182","Hey. Excuse me, you said?"
750,"00:58:08,183","00:58:12,895","Why are you angry?
It was just a little hit."
751,"00:58:12,896","00:58:18,442","What's with this kid?
Why are you so arrogant?"
752,"00:58:18,443","00:58:20,986","Stop it, all of you."
753,"00:58:23,740","00:58:25,533",He told us to stop...
754,"00:58:26,993","00:58:28,786","You don't know, do you?"
755,"00:58:29,996","00:58:35,501","Oye, don't you have any
sense of apologies at all?"
756,"00:58:35,502","00:58:36,627",Y-yes.
757,"00:58:36,628","00:58:41,340","What? Do you know what
usually happens at times like this?"
758,"00:58:41,341","00:58:42,716",N-No.
759,"00:58:42,717","00:58:47,471",Don't know? Then I'll tell you.
760,"00:58:47,472","00:58:49,515","Listen carefully, you know."
761,"00:58:51,142","00:58:55,312",What about compensation money?
762,"00:58:55,313","00:58:58,232",Compensation? How much?
763,"00:58:58,233","00:58:59,942","Yes, 1000 yen."
764,"00:58:59,943","00:59:04,280","Wait, because you are
arrogant, how about 2000 yen?"
765,"00:59:04,281","00:59:11,162","But this is not coercion, you
know. This is just a suggestion."
766,"00:59:11,955","00:59:15,708","Hahaha, you junior high school student."
767,"00:59:15,709","00:59:19,420",If that's all I can pay happily.
768,"00:59:19,421","00:59:24,300","I always carry paper
money for times like this."
769,"00:59:24,467","00:59:26,552",Take this.
770,"00:59:27,053","00:59:32,182","Hah? Why is this money
has picture of Osamu Tezuka?"
771,"00:59:32,183","00:59:36,061","Alas, this is money from the future."
772,"00:59:36,062","00:59:38,272","Did you take this money
from the children's bank?"
773,"00:59:38,273","00:59:41,567","Oye, don't mess around. Bring
out the real thing! Take it out!"
774,"00:59:41,568","00:59:44,111","Come on, get out the real money!"
775,"00:59:51,286","00:59:56,790","I can drive this vehicle, you know,
because I'm actually an adult."
776,"00:59:58,293","01:00:00,044","Go, scooter!"
777,"01:00:03,673","01:00:05,633","Okay, scooter!"
778,"01:00:05,634","01:00:07,009","Hey, scooter!"
779,"01:00:10,680","01:00:14,725","In this era there is no
control of the sound, huh?"
780,"01:00:15,685","01:00:20,397","Then, how about we start the punishment?"
781,"01:00:20,398","01:00:21,690",Stupid brat...
782,"01:00:28,406","01:00:31,200",My scooter!
783,"01:00:31,201","01:00:33,619",Forgive me!
784,"01:00:33,620","01:00:35,371",Dammit.
785,"01:00:38,124","01:00:39,541",Hah?
786,"01:00:55,684","01:00:57,559",Excuse me!
787,"01:01:12,117","01:01:14,618",Forgive me!
788,"01:01:26,131","01:01:27,381",Shizuka?
789,"01:01:45,984","01:01:48,152","Hey, you..."
790,"01:01:53,241","01:01:55,743","Yes, you are interesting too."
791,"01:01:58,997","01:02:04,626","Wait a minute. Come to think
of it, this is your fault, right?"
792,"01:02:06,379","01:02:10,507","You're just junior high school kids.
You can't do like this."
793,"01:02:10,508","01:02:13,886","How can you threaten
adult who is older than you."
794,"01:02:15,305","01:02:18,974",How could you be...
795,"01:02:25,148","01:02:28,233",How could you avoid it!
796,"01:02:28,234","01:02:31,153",Eh? Why just now?
797,"01:02:31,613","01:02:36,408",How dare you. I can't forgive!
798,"01:02:37,535","01:02:39,286",Take this!
799,"01:02:41,581","01:02:45,793",It hurts... It's scary...
800,"01:02:45,794","01:02:50,839","Geez.
Where is the adult Nobita?"
801,"01:02:53,301","01:02:55,010",Nobita!
802,"01:03:06,106","01:03:07,314",Nobita!
803,"01:03:08,108","01:03:10,067",Nobita!
804,"01:03:23,206","01:03:25,874",It's very dangerous. Let's go down first.
805,"01:03:29,254","01:03:31,713","Nobita, are you okay?"
806,"01:03:34,843","01:03:37,845",Who are you?
807,"01:03:37,846","01:03:42,224","It's me, Doraemon! Just hold on!"
808,"01:03:43,810","01:03:49,106",That is true. I'm just stunned a little...
809,"01:03:49,107","01:03:51,316","Your consciousness starts to
lose little by little! Nobita, hang on!"
810,"01:03:51,317","01:03:53,610","Hang in there, Nobita!"
811,"01:03:55,697","01:03:57,322",Don’t worry.
812,"01:04:00,618","01:04:02,870","I will definitely restore
my future with Shizuka."
813,"01:04:03,830","01:04:04,830",Nobita...
814,"01:04:09,711","01:04:12,004","We don't have time. Come on, quickly!"
815,"01:04:12,005","01:04:15,507","You guys calm down, please."
816,"01:04:15,508","01:04:20,012",It's your nature that makes us nervous!
817,"01:04:20,013","01:04:22,139",Stop bothering weak people.
818,"01:04:23,766","01:04:26,393",Who are you?
819,"01:04:26,394","01:04:29,521",The kids in this town are all so arrogant.
820,"01:04:30,732","01:04:34,026","If you don't step aside
it can be dangerous."
821,"01:04:34,027","01:04:35,861","Shizuka, run away!"
822,"01:04:45,330","01:04:47,372",Why?
823,"01:04:47,373","01:04:49,625",Get away from Shizuka!
824,"01:04:49,626","01:04:51,126",Nobita!
825,"01:04:53,254","01:04:55,214",You are!
826,"01:04:59,177","01:05:00,928","Hah? Again, again..."
827,"01:05:02,388","01:05:03,931",My head is dizzy...
828,"01:05:03,932","01:05:06,016",It felt like he was so hard to hit!
829,"01:05:06,017","01:05:09,144",That's not the case...
830,"01:05:09,145","01:05:11,313",You can't run away!
831,"01:05:14,901","01:05:15,526",Gian?
832,"01:05:16,236","01:05:19,696","So you ran off here, didn't you, Nobita?"
833,"01:05:19,697","01:05:21,490",You!
834,"01:05:32,669","01:05:35,671","If this toy is damaged, you
have to compensate, you know."
835,"01:05:35,672","01:05:37,172",Suneo!
836,"01:05:38,633","01:05:40,634",Who are you?
837,"01:05:42,011","01:05:48,058","The only ones allowed to
beat Nobita are us, you know!"
838,"01:05:56,234","01:05:57,943","Just remember, yes!"
839,"01:06:04,325","01:06:06,243","You're great too, Nobita."
840,"01:06:07,203","01:06:11,957","You are so sloppy, huh.
Even though you can't fight."
841,"01:06:12,917","01:06:17,462",Did 1 protect Shizuka?
842,"01:06:19,924","01:06:22,134",Hooray!
843,"01:06:28,349","01:06:31,435",Nobita? Why? Just hold on!
844,"01:06:31,436","01:06:34,021",Nobita got on a scooter earlier and fell.
845,"01:06:34,022","01:06:34,813",What?
846,"01:06:34,814","01:06:36,606",Maybe he hit his head.
847,"01:06:36,607","01:06:41,612","Bad, bad, bad, bad, bad, bad, bad, bad!"
848,"01:06:42,822","01:06:45,324","Hang in there, Nobita!"
849,"01:06:46,034","01:06:48,035",Don’t worry.
850,"01:06:48,036","01:06:52,205",We will surely find my adult myself.
851,"01:06:52,206","01:07:00,213",I will protect my future with Shizuka...
852,"01:07:00,214","01:07:03,091","Nobita! Ah, Nobita!"
853,"01:07:03,092","01:07:07,596","How about this? At this rate,
Nobita will lose his memory!"
854,"01:07:07,597","01:07:10,015",Where is the adult Nobita? Damnit!
855,"01:07:11,893","01:07:17,105","How about this? Is there
no gadget that can be used?"
856,"01:07:17,106","01:07:18,273",Oh yes! There is this!
857,"01:07:20,026","01:07:22,235",Go to where adult Nobita is!
858,"01:07:24,906","01:07:29,451",He's not an adult Nobita currently...
859,"01:07:29,452","01:07:35,707","Ah, what should I do? What should I do?"
860,"01:07:36,542","01:07:38,126",Wait a minute.
861,"01:07:38,127","01:07:41,671","If I say more carefully, will it work?"
862,"01:07:42,840","01:07:47,511","Go to little Nobita's place
where there is an adult Nobita!"
863,"01:07:55,770","01:07:58,105",Nobita! Nobita!
864,"01:07:58,106","01:08:00,399","Oye, hang on, Nobita!"
865,"01:08:00,400","01:08:02,859",We've called an ambulance!
866,"01:08:03,611","01:08:05,112","Hooray, it worked!"
867,"01:08:08,991","01:08:10,951",Who is it?
868,"01:08:10,952","01:08:14,705","Do not ask.
Just put this rope on that Nobita."
869,"01:08:14,706","01:08:15,706",Okay!
870,"01:08:18,418","01:08:20,252",He can't go back.
871,"01:08:22,755","01:08:24,172",What happened?
872,"01:08:24,173","01:08:27,801","Just try it first!
Don't say you can't!"
873,"01:08:27,802","01:08:30,429",But the mechanism was set up like this...
874,"01:08:30,430","01:08:35,683","I said try it first! If Nobita doesn't
come back, I'll crush you to pieces!"
875,"01:08:35,684","01:08:37,185",Even if you say so...
876,"01:08:37,437","01:08:42,149","Do not give up!
If we don't try it, we won't know, right?"
877,"01:08:42,150","01:08:45,944","A-Alright. Geez, using the
rope is very rough, though."
878,"01:08:48,990","01:08:53,034","See. The time has been
too long, so he can't go back."
879,"01:08:53,035","01:08:54,035",Shut up!
880,"01:08:54,996","01:08:56,329",Hold on...
881,"01:09:00,710","01:09:02,460",I can't do it...
882,"01:09:03,171","01:09:05,046",What happened?
883,"01:09:05,047","01:09:08,424","Nobita, do you want this?"
884,"01:09:08,425","01:09:13,013","Your memories of Gian, Suneo,
and Shizuka will be lost, you know."
885,"01:09:13,014","01:09:15,307","Really? You're kidding, right?"
886,"01:09:15,308","01:09:16,475","You're kidding, right?"
887,"01:09:17,101","01:09:21,855","Nobita, you will forget me too."
888,"01:09:21,856","01:09:24,775",Do you want that?
889,"01:09:38,372","01:09:41,875",I do not want!
890,"01:10:00,436","01:10:02,562","Oh, It's moving!"
891,"01:10:03,940","01:10:05,524",We made it in time.
892,"01:10:06,818","01:10:08,109",Nobita!
893,"01:10:46,899","01:10:49,568",Nobita! Nobita!
894,"01:10:52,405","01:10:54,155",Shizuka?
895,"01:10:56,617","01:10:59,744","Geez! Nobita, you idiot!"
896,"01:10:59,829","01:11:03,248","Why are you fighting,
even though you can't?"
897,"01:11:03,249","01:11:05,333",Don't force it.
898,"01:11:05,334","01:11:08,753",Let it be what you are!
899,"01:11:23,144","01:11:25,228",Are you alright?
900,"01:11:25,229","01:11:29,399",Yes. I think I can go home.
901,"01:11:29,400","01:11:32,027","Yes. Looks like I've been able
to go back to my Shizuka's place."
902,"01:11:36,824","01:11:41,161","But before returning to the future,
there is one place I want to visit."
903,"01:11:41,162","01:11:46,791","Because I have to make a
speech at the wedding, right?"
904,"01:11:46,792","01:11:48,084","Could it be, you want to go to..."
905,"01:11:48,085","01:11:49,669","Yes, our"
906,"01:11:49,670","01:11:51,129","Yes, our birthday!"
907,"01:11:51,130","01:11:57,010","That's right. I also want to make sure that
I really am the child of this family,..."
908,"01:11:57,011","01:11:59,596",...and why they gave me the name Nobita.
909,"01:11:59,597","01:12:01,556",I also want to know.
910,"01:12:01,557","01:12:05,936","Okay, okay. It's been this
far, I just follow your wishes."
911,"01:12:16,530","01:12:19,658","Wow, this was my house 10 years ago!"
912,"01:12:21,702","01:12:24,245","At that time, this room
was still Father's room."
913,"01:12:24,246","01:12:27,165",Looks like we've stolen her hobby room.
914,"01:12:27,166","01:12:30,543",There are no blisters on the pillars yet.
915,"01:12:30,544","01:12:33,421",But there's nobody here.
916,"01:12:33,422","01:12:36,883","If my parents are not here, how am I born?"
917,"01:12:36,884","01:12:40,387","Could it be that you are
really an adopted child?"
918,"01:12:40,388","01:12:43,348",See. That is right!
919,"01:12:43,349","01:12:46,142","Calm down, they must be in the hospital."
920,"01:12:46,811","01:12:48,436",Where is she? Where is she?
921,"01:12:48,437","01:12:51,690","Oh, Dad! 10 years younger!"
922,"01:12:51,691","01:12:54,442","From my point of view,
he's 25 years younger!"
923,"01:12:55,695","01:12:57,570",Still like a young man.
924,"01:12:57,571","01:13:00,365",Who are you?
925,"01:13:00,449","01:13:02,742",You forgot your own son!
926,"01:13:02,743","01:13:06,329","Do not say like that!
You weren't born here!"
927,"01:13:06,330","01:13:10,834","Excuse me, it looks like
we are at the wrong house."
928,"01:13:13,337","01:13:15,130",What is that?
929,"01:13:15,131","01:13:19,342","Instead of thinking about
that, where is the baby, huh?"
930,"01:13:19,343","01:13:23,013",Even though I was home early from work.
931,"01:13:24,223","01:13:27,600","Ah, where? Where? Here, huh?"
932,"01:13:29,228","01:13:31,229",Isn't he at the hospital?
933,"01:13:31,230","01:13:33,022",Oh yes! That is true!
934,"01:13:35,526","01:13:37,527",In such a hurry.
935,"01:13:38,320","01:13:40,864","By the way, where is the hospital?"
936,"01:13:40,865","01:13:44,534",Wait a minute! We're coming too!
937,"01:13:49,206","01:13:52,959","Congratulations, sir! Your son is born."
938,"01:13:52,960","01:13:54,753","Oh, thanks for the food!"
939,"01:13:54,754","01:13:57,255","No, I mean... thank you."
940,"01:13:57,256","01:13:58,423",Come here.
941,"01:13:58,424","01:14:01,801","Huh, I'm so excited."
942,"01:14:01,802","01:14:06,181","I'm excited too.
What type of baby that be?"
943,"01:14:06,182","01:14:09,768",Must be a cute kid like us.
944,"01:14:09,769","01:14:13,897","Hahaha, it's better not
to get your hopes up."
945,"01:14:15,900","01:14:16,858",Tama-Chan!
946,"01:14:19,528","01:14:22,906","Hello, this is Dad, son!"
947,"01:14:23,783","01:14:27,911","How cute he's. This is my son, right?"
948,"01:14:27,912","01:14:30,413","Hello, my baby!"
949,"01:14:30,414","01:14:33,249",1 want to see too!
950,"01:14:34,001","01:14:35,668",Is this me?
951,"01:14:35,669","01:14:38,630","Why are there wrinkles like
this? Looks like a monkey!"
952,"01:14:39,673","01:14:42,383","What do you mean monkey, huh?"
953,"01:14:44,929","01:14:48,139",That was shocking. Don't be that angry too.
954,"01:14:48,140","01:14:50,391","He's mad because you
weren't being polite, right?"
955,"01:14:50,392","01:14:53,686","After all, isn't baby Nobita cute?"
956,"01:14:53,687","01:14:59,234","No! Not cute at all!
Surely that baby is not me!"
957,"01:14:59,235","01:15:02,195","Newborn babies are like that, you know."
958,"01:15:02,196","01:15:04,531",Who are those kids?
959,"01:15:04,532","01:15:06,950",They've been following me from earlier.
960,"01:15:06,951","01:15:09,744",I wonder what their parents look like.
961,"01:15:11,122","01:15:14,499","Where's my mom, by the way?
She should be with you, right?"
962,"01:15:14,500","01:15:17,836","Oh, she said she wanted
to tell our ancestors."
963,"01:15:17,837","01:15:19,629","She must be very happy, huh?"
964,"01:15:19,630","01:15:23,508","Yes, she couldn't stop crying."
965,"01:15:24,510","01:15:26,344",This bear?
966,"01:15:26,345","01:15:28,721",Mother's gift for this child.
967,"01:15:29,849","01:15:31,724","Too fast, right?"
968,"01:15:37,314","01:15:41,401","By the way, what about this child's name?"
969,"01:15:41,402","01:15:43,486",I thought about it carefully.
970,"01:15:43,487","01:15:45,572",What is that?
971,"01:15:45,573","01:15:48,867","Tadaaa, I'm telling you, yes."
972,"01:15:48,868","01:15:51,119",Nobita Nobi!
973,"01:15:52,121","01:15:53,830",Nobita?
974,"01:15:53,831","01:15:55,456","Nice name, right?"
975,"01:15:56,000","01:15:58,918",I want a cooler name.
976,"01:15:58,919","01:16:01,296","They should listen to our hopes, please."
977,"01:16:01,297","01:16:04,257","Stop it, stop it. You'll be
scolded again, you know!"
978,"01:16:04,258","01:16:07,635","The meaning of the
name? Of course there is!"
979,"01:16:07,636","01:16:13,725","I want this child to
grow up healthy always."
980,"01:16:13,726","01:16:15,768",What a nice name.
981,"01:16:16,645","01:16:18,438",Nobita Nobi.
982,"01:16:21,192","01:16:22,525",I like that name.
983,"01:16:23,777","01:16:27,113",So they thought about the name carefully.
984,"01:16:30,284","01:16:33,328",I want to raise him to be a good boy.
985,"01:16:34,413","01:16:37,040",He must be a good boy!
986,"01:16:37,041","01:16:41,044","If he looks like you,
he will be doing well."
987,"01:16:41,045","01:16:45,548","If he looks like you, he
will be good at sports."
988,"01:16:45,549","01:16:46,424",Truly.
989,"01:16:46,425","01:16:49,636","You only looks alike in the
weak spots of your parents."
990,"01:16:49,637","01:16:51,220","What a chatterbox, ah!"
991,"01:16:51,931","01:16:56,434","Is he going to be a professor?
Or a baseball player?"
992,"01:16:56,435","01:16:57,977",He can be a painter too.
993,"01:16:59,605","01:17:02,357","Painter, sculptor, musician."
994,"01:17:02,358","01:17:03,691",Anything is okay.
995,"01:17:03,692","01:17:06,945","As long as he is of
use to those around him."
996,"01:17:06,946","01:17:09,948",Care for others and be brave.
997,"01:17:09,949","01:17:14,744","A cheerful child, a real boy,
strong, fair, and handsome."
998,"01:17:16,705","01:17:21,000","Um, don't get your hopes up, anyway."
999,"01:17:21,001","01:17:23,670","He's not that great kid, really."
1000,"01:17:23,671","01:17:28,508","From earlier you kept bothering me.
Do you have a grudge against my son?!"
1001,"01:17:35,015","01:17:36,849",Father and mother
1002,"01:17:36,850","01:17:38,810",They are very happy.
1003,"01:17:38,811","01:17:41,729",They are full of hope.
1004,"01:17:47,611","01:17:50,113",Let's go back to the future.
1005,"01:18:06,046","01:18:08,131",Finally we are back.
1006,"01:18:14,388","01:18:16,431","Oh, come here."
1007,"01:18:16,432","01:18:17,181",What? What?
1008,"01:18:17,224","01:18:18,182",Why?
1009,"01:18:19,935","01:18:21,227",Look at that.
1010,"01:18:22,271","01:18:27,233","In a place like that, greeting
means thanking your parents."
1011,"01:18:27,234","01:18:33,322","Be thankful? They always get
mad when I get 0 points! I can not!"
1012,"01:18:34,324","01:18:36,534",You're still thinking about it.
1013,"01:18:36,535","01:18:38,786",To run like that...
1014,"01:18:41,832","01:18:43,332","Come on, quickly."
1015,"01:18:43,333","01:18:48,921","Um... sorry, yeah. But can you go alone?"
1016,"01:18:49,798","01:18:53,926","We still have important
promise that we must keep."
1017,"01:18:53,927","01:18:55,636","Right, Doraemon?"
1018,"01:18:56,805","01:19:01,017","Oh, I see?
If so, this is goodbye."
1019,"01:19:06,106","01:19:07,982",Thank you for finding me.
1020,"01:19:07,983","01:19:09,942",Thank you for finding me.:
1021,"01:19:09,943","01:19:13,863",Your future is mine too.:
1022,"01:19:13,947","01:19:17,408",Oh yes! This.
1023,"01:19:21,705","01:19:22,705",This...
1024,"01:19:24,708","01:19:25,541","See you later, yes!"
1025,"01:19:28,837","01:19:31,714","By the way, what is that important promise?"
1026,"01:19:50,526","01:19:53,444",Thanks for waiting!
1027,"01:19:56,031","01:19:58,825",Thank you!
1028,"01:20:00,577","01:20:06,916","Everyone, my healthy
friend, Nobita, is back!"
1029,"01:20:06,917","01:20:10,086","Thank goodness, we survived."
1030,"01:20:10,087","01:20:11,671","Thank you, Nobita!"
1031,"01:20:12,881","01:20:14,799",Really grateful!
1032,"01:20:15,634","01:20:17,426",But it took him a long time to come back.
1033,"01:20:19,012","01:20:21,097","I've bought time for you, you know."
1034,"01:20:34,111","01:20:35,820",Welcome back.
1035,"01:20:36,613","01:20:39,407","I am back.
You must be worried, right?"
1036,"01:20:39,408","01:20:40,950",Not really.
1037,"01:20:40,951","01:20:43,744",Not at all.
1038,"01:20:44,955","01:20:51,586","Then, let us hear the Greeting
remarks from our groom once again."
1039,"01:20:52,713","01:20:54,046",The rain has stopped.
1040,"01:21:10,189","01:21:13,482","Everyone, good afternoon. I am Nobita Nobi."
1041,"01:21:13,483","01:21:15,276",We know already!
1042,"01:21:17,321","01:21:20,990","At first, I didn't like this name."
1043,"01:21:21,700","01:21:23,784",Because it seems slow and stupid.
1044,"01:21:24,995","01:21:30,144","But when I was born, my
parents gave me this name"
1045,"01:21:30,156","01:21:35,421","in the hope that I will
continue to grow.healthily."
1046,"01:21:35,422","01:21:39,008","Now, I really like this name."
1047,"01:21:39,510","01:21:42,053","It's like he was there and saw
everything that was going on, huh?"
1048,"01:21:42,888","01:21:46,265","I was raised by my
parents and my grandma..."
1049,"01:21:46,266","01:21:51,229","And also my grandma, they
took care of me with great love."
1050,"01:21:51,688","01:21:57,818","When I was a kid and came home
crying, Grandma always comforted me."
1051,"01:21:58,403","01:22:03,699",And Grandma always believed what I said.
1052,"01:22:04,535","01:22:10,540","When I got zero points,
Mom always scolded me."
1053,"01:22:10,541","01:22:15,628","And Father taught me
to try to reach my dreams."
1054,"01:22:16,129","01:22:22,802",I grew up with your love.
1055,"01:22:22,803","01:22:25,680",And Shizuka's father...
1056,"01:22:26,515","01:22:33,062","You once said that I am a person who
understands the pain of other people."
1057,"01:22:33,063","01:22:39,026",It's because my family taught me that.
1058,"01:22:40,946","01:22:46,575","Maybe I did not become the child my
parents and grandma expected me to be."
1059,"01:22:46,576","01:22:55,960","Maybe they expected me to
become a painter or a baseball player."
1060,"01:22:55,961","01:22:57,962","Wow, their hopes all failed!"
1061,"01:22:58,463","01:23:00,006",You're so loud!
1062,"01:23:03,844","01:23:07,638",But I can say this one thing.
1063,"01:23:07,639","01:23:12,101",I've been raised by a wonderful family.
1064,"01:23:12,102","01:23:16,606","Because of that, even
though it can't be expected,"
1065,"01:23:16,607","01:23:21,110",".. I want to make a
warm family with Shizuka."
1066,"01:23:21,111","01:23:25,656","In this regard, I am very confident."
1067,"01:23:25,657","01:23:35,333","If I do that, I feel I have returned the
services of my parents and grandma."
1068,"01:23:36,126","01:23:39,128","Mother, father."
1069,"01:23:39,129","01:23:42,131",Shizuka's Father and Mother.
1070,"01:23:42,132","01:23:45,134",We will follow in your footsteps;
1071,"01:23:46,428","01:23:47,720",Shizuka.
1072,"01:23:48,972","01:23:53,684",Let's make a happy family like them.
1073,"01:24:44,861","01:24:46,070",What is wrong?
1074,"01:24:49,074","01:24:52,076","No, nothing."
1075,"01:25:10,387","01:25:11,846",Are you going home already?
1076,"01:25:12,806","01:25:17,226",Grandma has seen enough.
1077,"01:25:29,531","01:25:33,743",Looks like Mom was here just now.
1078,"01:25:33,744","01:25:35,244","Oh, you feel so too?"
1079,"01:25:36,455","01:25:41,000",It's -possible that Mom actually came here.
1080,"01:26:00,896","01:26:01,937",Nobita.
1081,"01:26:03,023","01:26:05,024","Your earlier was fake, right?"
1082,"01:26:06,276","01:26:09,653",That... er...
1083,"01:26:09,654","01:26:13,032",Even though you are better off just you.
1084,"01:26:13,033","01:26:16,535",You always hide your own sadness...
1085,"01:26:16,536","01:26:22,249","But in the end, you must be
helped by Doraemon again, right?"
1086,"01:26:28,924","01:26:32,176",I came back for the sake of my happiness.
1087,"01:26:32,594","01:26:37,223","With that, Shizuka must also be happy."
1088,"01:26:39,893","01:26:41,435",Very good!
1089,"01:26:44,356","01:26:46,440",Oh yes. This.
1090,"01:26:49,069","01:26:52,196",I want to start all over again.
1091,"01:27:44,249","01:27:46,834","OK, we're going home?"
1092,"01:27:47,711","01:27:48,711","Nobita,"
1093,"01:27:49,713","01:27:53,674",You really did fulfill Grandma's dream.
1094,"01:27:55,176","01:27:56,510",Thank you.
1095,"01:27:57,262","01:28:02,141","You're welcome. I'm also grateful for being
able to keep my promise to my grandmother."
1096,"01:28:02,142","01:28:07,146",Yes. Grandma is really very happy.
1097,"01:28:08,481","01:28:09,523",But...
1098,"01:28:10,483","01:28:11,275",But...
1099,"01:28:12,152","01:28:17,323",In order to keep Grandma's promise...
1100,"01:28:18,742","01:28:30,044","You must have suffered a lot
just to keep Grandma's promise."
1101,"01:28:30,045","01:28:35,049",That whiny little Nobita...
1102,"01:28:36,009","01:28:39,929",To end up being a good boy like this.
1103,"01:28:41,514","01:28:49,229",That's what made Grandma the happiest.
1104,"01:28:50,482","01:28:51,649",Grandma!
1105,"01:28:53,568","01:28:54,943",I'm not like that.
1106,"01:28:56,196","01:28:59,615","I'm a stupid coward,"
1107,"01:28:59,616","01:29:01,575",also a crybaby...
1108,"01:29:02,744","01:29:09,041","But Nobita has real strength, right?"
1109,"01:29:10,585","01:29:19,093","Shizuka must know that too,
that's why she became your bride."
1110,"01:29:19,094","01:29:21,220",Grandma!
1111,"01:29:21,221","01:29:28,352","Oh, oh, you're back to
being little Nobita again."
1112,"01:29:31,106","01:29:33,399",Can I come again?
1113,"01:29:35,318","01:29:38,696",You can come no matter how many times.
1114,"01:29:38,697","01:29:43,450",Grandma will be waiting for you here.
1115,"01:30:03,263","01:30:07,016","So the time machine can drive itself, huh?"
1116,"01:30:07,017","01:30:11,103",Yes. I'm tired of driving today.
1117,"01:30:11,104","01:30:16,900","So many things happened.
It's you, really."
1118,"01:30:17,235","01:30:20,237","Hehehe. Sorry, yes, Doraemon."
1119,"01:30:20,238","01:30:22,364",Are you really sorry?
1120,"01:30:22,365","01:30:23,991",Of course! It's true!
1121,"01:30:24,033","01:30:26,160",Really?
1122,"01:30:29,497","01:30:31,790","How stubborn, huh!"
1123,"01:30:35,295","01:30:38,297","Oh, damn it! Forgetful Stick!"
1124,"01:30:38,298","01:30:43,218",This is bad! Nobita forgot his memory.
1125,"01:30:43,219","01:30:45,596","This is really bad, right?"
1126,"01:30:47,223","01:30:48,515",But wait!
1127,"01:30:49,309","01:30:54,313","Nobita, Nobita, Nobita..."
1128,"01:30:58,651","01:31:04,031","Doraemon?
Why am I riding a time machine?"
1129,"01:31:04,032","01:31:07,148","You see, we have just
experienced something very"
1130,"01:31:07,160","01:31:10,287","troublesome, but also
something very beautiful.-"
1131,"01:31:10,288","01:31:12,956","Eh? What is that? What
is that? Please, tell me!"
1132,"01:31:12,999","01:31:15,209","When you grow up, you will know."
1133,"01:31:15,335","01:31:17,085","Until then, it's better if you don't Know."
1134,"01:31:17,253","01:31:20,756",Why is that? What happened?
1135,"01:31:20,757","01:31:23,008",How much do you remember?
1136,"01:31:23,009","01:31:27,262","Hmm, we met Grandma..."
1137,"01:31:27,305","01:31:30,724","Oh yes! We have to show
my .bride to Grandma!"
1138,"01:31:30,725","01:31:33,352",Take it easy. Everything is finished.
1139,"01:31:33,603","01:31:38,357",Eh? What does it mean? Tell me please!
1140,"01:31:38,399","01:31:41,985","How stubborn, huh! I won't tell!"
1141,"01:31:41,986","01:31:45,155","Please, Doraemon!"
