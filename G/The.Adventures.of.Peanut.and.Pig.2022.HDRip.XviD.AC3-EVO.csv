in a faraway place..."
3,"00:00:40,615","00:00:44,753","the beautiful island of Goola
began sinking into the sea."
4,"00:00:50,259","00:00:53,029","All the creatures of Goola
lived in helpless fear"
5,"00:00:53,162","00:00:55,664","of the day when their island
home would vanish"
6,"00:00:55,797","00:00:57,133",under the waves.
7,"00:00:58,633","00:01:01,137","- Ah, not yet.
- Oh, boy."
8,"00:01:03,973","00:01:06,242","But they knew
it would happen one day."
9,"00:01:07,977","00:01:09,744","- Ah... no.
- Oh, yeah."
10,"00:01:13,815","00:01:17,353","Until an especially clever
monkey named Moneke"
11,"00:01:17,485","00:01:19,788",had a very big idea.
12,"00:01:22,857","00:01:25,394","He would build
a great machine to harness"
13,"00:01:25,527","00:01:28,164","the power of the volcano
and all the fruit of Goola,"
14,"00:01:28,297","00:01:32,600","and create a concoction that
would keep the island afloat."
15,"00:01:34,502","00:01:36,072",When it was finished...
16,"00:02:06,435","00:02:08,404","The machine worked better
than anyone"
17,"00:02:08,536","00:02:10,072",could have ever dreamed.
18,"00:02:17,512","00:02:21,317","And there Goola remained for
generation after generation,"
19,"00:02:21,450","00:02:23,685",safely above the water.
20,"00:02:24,286","00:02:26,055",Until one day...
21,"00:02:27,722","00:02:31,260","Moneke's amazing machine
began to fail."
22,"00:02:41,836","00:02:43,605",Watch the pressure!
23,"00:02:46,342","00:02:48,210",You! Get on that valve.
24,"00:02:48,344","00:02:49,912","Yes, sir."
25,"00:02:53,581","00:02:56,085","Ooh, out of my way!"
26,"00:03:13,701","00:03:15,137",Ooh!
27,"00:03:21,310","00:03:24,947","Cheek, buddy.
No need to crash the party."
28,"00:03:26,248","00:03:28,517","You might try being
a little lighter on your feet."
29,"00:03:28,650","00:03:29,784",Oops.
30,"00:03:29,919","00:03:32,021",Be still my beating heart.
31,"00:03:32,154","00:03:36,591","What's all that noise, anyway?"
32,"00:03:36,724","00:03:39,128","Yeah, that's it."
33,"00:03:40,896","00:03:42,465",You mind turning it down?
34,"00:03:44,033","00:03:47,269","Whoa, there,
take a number, big boy."
35,"00:03:47,403","00:03:49,004","There's plenty of me
to go around."
36,"00:03:49,138","00:03:51,040",The old ape wants to see you.
37,"00:03:51,173","00:03:53,442","The executive summons.
Well, what do you know?"
38,"00:03:53,576","00:03:55,010","I must have done
something right."
39,"00:03:55,144","00:03:58,948","Duty calls, girls."
40,"00:03:59,081","00:04:00,883","Always leave them
wanting more,"
41,"00:04:01,016","00:04:03,285","that's my motto.
I can see it's yours, too."
42,"00:04:06,222","00:04:07,789","Somebody should do
something about that."
43,"00:04:11,894","00:04:13,596","What do you know?
This used to be the way"
44,"00:04:13,728","00:04:15,064",to my uncle's office.
45,"00:04:15,197","00:04:16,999","I guess we'll just have
to turn around."
46,"00:04:23,305","00:04:26,774","- Out of the way, pork chop.
- Oh, ah!"
47,"00:04:27,476","00:04:29,545",Huh?
48,"00:04:29,677","00:04:32,348","Now, that's what
I call cheek to cheek."
49,"00:04:32,481","00:04:36,085","Oh, pardon,
oh, excuse me. Sorry, sir."
50,"00:04:36,851","00:04:39,522","Don't mention it.
And keep up the good work."
51,"00:04:40,089","00:04:42,358","Say, don't I know you?"
52,"00:04:44,126","00:04:48,364","I could fire you, ham hocks,
but if this island sinks,"
53,"00:04:48,497","00:04:49,797",we might need an extra float.
54,"00:04:49,932","00:04:52,834","- Ha! You think?
- Ah, don't listen to him!"
55,"00:04:52,968","00:04:57,006","I happen to like a fellow
who enjoys life... a lot."
56,"00:04:58,440","00:05:00,142",For luck.
57,"00:05:06,482","00:05:09,652","Hey, Sal, baby.
Long time, no see."
58,"00:05:12,254","00:05:14,689","Piece of advice:
you need to learn who really"
59,"00:05:14,822","00:05:18,360","runs this company, and start
spreading the sugar around,"
60,"00:05:18,494","00:05:19,929",if you know what I mean.
61,"00:05:20,462","00:05:21,931",Oh!
62,"00:05:22,830","00:05:24,266","Ah, Peanut."
63,"00:05:24,400","00:05:26,335",Uncle Moneke!
64,"00:05:28,637","00:05:30,039",There you are.
65,"00:05:30,172","00:05:32,408","How did you know
I was coming to see you today?"
66,"00:05:32,541","00:05:33,943",Were you?
67,"00:05:34,076","00:05:35,411","Well, it's downright eerie
when that happens."
68,"00:05:35,544","00:05:36,679",Like a sixth sense.
69,"00:05:36,811","00:05:38,347",Must be that family connection.
70,"00:05:39,281","00:05:41,450","Over here.
That's better."
71,"00:05:41,584","00:05:43,219","Now, what can I do for you?"
72,"00:05:43,352","00:05:46,821","Peanut, I'd like you to meet
an honored citizen of Goola."
73,"00:05:47,990","00:05:49,724",Pink was one of the builders
74,"00:05:49,857","00:05:51,793","of the original
Goola Juice processors."
75,"00:05:51,927","00:05:55,164","Great Goola!
That makes you..."
76,"00:05:57,900","00:06:00,202",A humble servant of Goola.
77,"00:06:00,336","00:06:03,472","Pink is one
of our family's oldest friends."
78,"00:06:03,606","00:06:04,739",Sure is.
79,"00:06:04,872","00:06:06,942",Pleasure to meet you.
80,"00:06:07,076","00:06:09,478","With a name like that,
school must have been rough."
81,"00:06:09,612","00:06:12,248",Not for me.
82,"00:06:12,381","00:06:14,483","There's no one
sharper than Pink."
83,"00:06:14,617","00:06:15,951",You don't say.
84,"00:06:16,085","00:06:17,886","I asked him
to come out of retirement"
85,"00:06:18,020","00:06:19,421","from the other side
of the island"
86,"00:06:19,555","00:06:21,290",to give us his perspective.
87,"00:06:21,423","00:06:24,093","I'm worried about the recent
breakdown of the machines."
88,"00:06:24,226","00:06:26,895","We're working on it, sir,
day and night."
89,"00:06:27,029","00:06:29,198","Of course you are, Cheek."
90,"00:06:29,331","00:06:31,267","But we can use
all the help we can get."
91,"00:06:31,400","00:06:34,570","He's right. There's anything
I've learned from my uncle,"
92,"00:06:34,703","00:06:36,939","it's that machines break down
and we repair them,"
93,"00:06:37,072","00:06:39,975","whatever it takes.
This time is no different."
94,"00:06:40,109","00:06:43,712","""We?"" When was the last time
you got your hands dirty?"
95,"00:06:43,845","00:06:45,147",I don't know.
96,"00:06:45,281","00:06:47,216","When was the last time
we shook hands?"
97,"00:06:49,184","00:06:52,820","Now, boys,
it's time we faced facts."
98,"00:06:52,955","00:06:55,324","If we don't fix
the problem soon."
99,"00:06:55,457","00:06:58,761","What went up
is going to splash down."
100,"00:06:58,927","00:07:01,330","That's why I ordered
an investigation"
101,"00:07:01,463","00:07:04,166","into the frequency
of incidents and malfunctions."
102,"00:07:04,300","00:07:06,702","If it involves
getting our hands dirty,"
103,"00:07:06,834","00:07:08,270",don't we have apes who do that?
104,"00:07:08,404","00:07:10,906","Getting your hands
a little dirty now, Peanut,"
105,"00:07:11,040","00:07:13,108",is good preparation for later.
106,"00:07:13,242","00:07:16,512","All this, my boy,
will be yours."
107,"00:07:19,348","00:07:21,450","Here's my lead
investigator now."
108,"00:07:21,583","00:07:23,851","Everyone, this is Flo."
109,"00:07:23,986","00:07:25,454",Good morning.
110,"00:07:25,587","00:07:27,890","Very, very clever."
111,"00:07:28,023","00:07:30,192",You did it without telling me?
112,"00:07:30,326","00:07:33,362","It was important
to get a fresh perspective."
113,"00:07:33,495","00:07:37,299","Flo, if you'd care to share
your findings with everyone?"
114,"00:07:37,433","00:07:39,867","Thank you. Gentlemen,
the data clearly shows that"
115,"00:07:40,002","00:07:43,138","in recent months, the frequency
of incidents and malfunctions"
116,"00:07:43,272","00:07:46,375","has dramatically gone up,
while the island has gone down."
117,"00:07:47,209","00:07:49,611","We're falling faster
than a ripe grapefruit."
118,"00:07:50,879","00:07:53,182","Looking closer, key indicators
suggest that there"
119,"00:07:53,315","00:07:55,084",is a pattern at work.
120,"00:08:00,923","00:08:04,360",Hmm. Uh-huh. Ah!
121,"00:08:12,634","00:08:14,937","Big, round, hungry?"
122,"00:08:15,070","00:08:16,905",You want a sandwich? No.
123,"00:08:17,406","00:08:20,743","Big problem.
One point for me."
124,"00:08:20,876","00:08:22,211",Next word. It's fun.
125,"00:08:22,344","00:08:26,014",Pointy... pineapple? Rock?
126,"00:08:27,182","00:08:29,017","Your pet rock
is a pointy pineapple?"
127,"00:08:29,952","00:08:32,454",Nah. Back to problem.
128,"00:08:32,588","00:08:34,656","Swimming? Boogie?
What are you doing?"
129,"00:08:34,790","00:08:36,925","Moving. Parts.
Machine."
130,"00:08:37,059","00:08:41,663",Ah! Ha-ha. Problem. Machine.
131,"00:08:42,131","00:08:44,233",Problem machine! I got it!
132,"00:08:44,366","00:08:48,036","The machines
all have one problem."
133,"00:08:48,170","00:08:50,739","- Why, yes. That's right.
- Huh?"
134,"00:08:50,873","00:08:53,075","We should be able
to trace all of the incidents"
135,"00:08:53,208","00:08:54,943",back to one central problem.
136,"00:08:55,077","00:08:57,045","I'm glad you see it, too."
137,"00:08:57,846","00:09:00,482","Oh, actually, it was..."
138,"00:09:03,318","00:09:08,090","obvious, in a not-so-obvious
sort of way,"
139,"00:09:08,223","00:09:10,058",if you see what I mean.
140,"00:09:10,192","00:09:12,194","Why, yes, I do."
141,"00:09:12,327","00:09:14,630","Now we just have
to find the problem."
142,"00:09:14,763","00:09:15,998","Excellent, Peanut."
143,"00:09:16,131","00:09:17,366","Now, hold the fruit."
144,"00:09:17,499","00:09:19,201","If there was a central problem,"
145,"00:09:19,334","00:09:21,570",I would have found it.
146,"00:09:21,703","00:09:23,872","Pink, what do you say?"
147,"00:09:24,373","00:09:27,476","Hmm.
I'm with the big one on this."
148,"00:09:27,609","00:09:29,678",I don't see it.
149,"00:09:29,812","00:09:32,214","But how can you say
that when it's so..."
150,"00:09:32,347","00:09:34,249","- Obvious?
- But what about the tremors?"
151,"00:09:34,383","00:09:37,586","It's been quiet
on my side of the island."
152,"00:09:37,719","00:09:39,354","The increased
volcanic activity?"
153,"00:09:39,488","00:09:43,325","Volcanoes are known
to bubble and boil."
154,"00:09:43,459","00:09:45,461","And the fact that Goola
is losing altitude."
155,"00:09:45,594","00:09:48,797","Ah, the excitability of youth."
156,"00:09:48,932","00:09:52,134","Then again, I can't see much
of anything these days."
157,"00:09:52,267","00:09:53,869",My dear Moneke.
158,"00:09:54,002","00:09:58,908","It appears that I have nothing
useful to contribute here."
159,"00:09:59,041","00:10:02,077",I'm afraid my time has passed.
160,"00:10:02,211","00:10:04,881","As mine soon
will be, too, old friend."
161,"00:10:05,013","00:10:06,148",Don't say that!
162,"00:10:06,281","00:10:09,084","Yeah, we'd be lost without you."
163,"00:10:09,218","00:10:11,119",Sooner than you think.
164,"00:10:12,956","00:10:15,324",I'll take my leave now.
165,"00:10:15,991","00:10:17,659",Thank you for your service.
166,"00:10:19,528","00:10:20,629",Stay sharp.
167,"00:10:20,762","00:10:23,065","Now, some of us
can get back to work."
168,"00:10:23,198","00:10:24,934",Not so fast!
169,"00:10:25,067","00:10:27,302","Boys, at a time like this,"
170,"00:10:27,436","00:10:29,104","we have to put aside
our differences"
171,"00:10:29,238","00:10:31,607","- and work together.
- Don't we always?"
172,"00:10:31,740","00:10:34,978","I'm glad you agree, because Flo
and I have come up with a plan"
173,"00:10:35,110","00:10:37,679",to deal with our dilemma.
174,"00:10:43,452","00:10:45,354","Not since
the days of Moneke I"
175,"00:10:45,487","00:10:48,892","has such
a noble task been undertaken."
176,"00:10:49,024","00:10:50,459",Look at that.
177,"00:10:51,827","00:10:53,729",Just a little warm.
178,"00:10:54,329","00:10:57,332","Somewhere out there,
something is causing"
179,"00:10:57,466","00:10:59,067","our great Goola to sink,"
180,"00:10:59,201","00:11:03,805","and this expedition
must find what it is,"
181,"00:11:03,940","00:11:07,242",or we are lost.
182,"00:11:07,911","00:11:09,645","- Yes, Peanut.
- Uh..."
183,"00:11:10,178","00:11:12,814","If the problem's
somewhere out there,"
184,"00:11:12,949","00:11:15,384",what are we doing up here?
185,"00:11:15,517","00:11:16,785",Ah...
186,"00:11:18,253","00:11:20,924",I salute you and I bid you all
187,"00:11:21,056","00:11:22,491",fruit speed.
188,"00:11:33,435","00:11:35,137",You mean we're going in there?
189,"00:11:35,270","00:11:37,205","It's the fastest way
to get around the island."
190,"00:11:37,339","00:11:39,074",Not to mention an early grave.
191,"00:11:39,207","00:11:41,276","Oh, it's not that dangerous."
192,"00:11:41,410","00:11:43,211","Almost all of our first
volunteers have come back."
193,"00:11:43,345","00:11:44,881",That's almost reassuring.
194,"00:11:47,215","00:11:48,918",What is so funny?
195,"00:11:49,685","00:11:52,688","Uncle Moneke, I was thinking."
196,"00:11:54,991","00:11:56,224",You were saying?
197,"00:11:56,358","00:11:58,627","What this team
really needs is a..."
198,"00:11:59,695","00:12:00,829",coordinator.
199,"00:12:00,964","00:12:02,731","- A coordinator?
- Exactly."
200,"00:12:02,864","00:12:06,868","Someone to remain behind
in case of emergencies."
201,"00:12:08,270","00:12:09,906",And since I'm an expert
202,"00:12:10,039","00:12:11,607","at reading messenger mugs,"
203,"00:12:11,740","00:12:14,978","I'll be able to send supplies
or help when it's needed."
204,"00:12:15,611","00:12:17,880","There will be no help, Peanut."
205,"00:12:18,014","00:12:19,748",No help?
206,"00:12:19,882","00:12:22,651","No one must ever know
about this."
207,"00:12:22,784","00:12:25,621","The citizens of Goola will
panic just like before"
208,"00:12:25,754","00:12:28,190","if they really knew
how bad things are."
209,"00:12:28,323","00:12:31,126","- Very, very, very sensible.
- Glad you agree."
210,"00:12:31,259","00:12:33,228",I'm a sensible fella.
211,"00:12:34,162","00:12:35,631",Don't miss your bubble.
212,"00:12:48,176","00:12:49,879","Hey, buddy."
213,"00:12:50,013","00:12:51,881","Thanks for that tip back there,
you made me look great."
214,"00:12:52,015","00:12:54,083","- Anything to help, sir.
- You mean that?"
215,"00:12:54,216","00:12:55,350","Sure, I do."
216,"00:12:55,484","00:12:56,953",You're all going to be heroes.
217,"00:12:57,086","00:12:59,588","In that case, throw
that wrench in the machine."
218,"00:12:59,721","00:13:01,090","- Throw the wrench?
- Do it!"
219,"00:13:01,223","00:13:02,959","- In the machine?
- Go on."
220,"00:13:03,092","00:13:04,593","- That's sabotage.
- That's an order."
221,"00:13:04,961","00:13:07,729",Uh-uh!
222,"00:13:07,863","00:13:10,365","You really had me going, sir,
that's a funny one."
223,"00:13:10,499","00:13:11,833","- Give me the wrench.
- Peanut!"
224,"00:13:11,968","00:13:14,202","- What's the matter?
- I don't do bubbles."
225,"00:13:14,336","00:13:16,605","Unless they're tiny
and in champagne."
226,"00:13:16,738","00:13:20,308","Let's face it, I'm just not
the monkey for this mission."
227,"00:13:20,442","00:13:22,344",Normally I'd agree with you.
228,"00:13:22,477","00:13:23,845","You should always trust
your better judgment."
229,"00:13:23,980","00:13:25,148",But I would be wrong.
230,"00:13:25,280","00:13:26,415","Now, now, no, don't doubt"
231,"00:13:26,548","00:13:28,250",yourself like that.
232,"00:13:28,383","00:13:30,519","Today, you showed me
that you truly understand"
233,"00:13:30,652","00:13:32,354","the complexities
of our problem."
234,"00:13:32,487","00:13:34,623",Even Cheek couldn't see it.
235,"00:13:34,756","00:13:35,992","Oh, that."
236,"00:13:36,125","00:13:37,559",I've never been more proud.
237,"00:13:37,693","00:13:39,996","Gee, what can I say?"
238,"00:13:40,129","00:13:43,198",I need you on this mission.
239,"00:13:43,331","00:13:44,800",When you put it that way...
240,"00:13:44,934","00:13:46,468","Hey, slow down there."
241,"00:13:46,601","00:13:48,037","What are you...
Hey, what are you, huh?"
242,"00:13:48,171","00:13:49,538",I thought we were friends here.
243,"00:13:49,671","00:13:51,573","I wish I could trade places
with you, sir."
244,"00:13:51,707","00:13:54,309","Well, your wish is my command!"
245,"00:13:55,477","00:13:56,611",Wait a minute.
246,"00:13:56,745","00:13:58,981","- That was fun!
- Bye-bye."
247,"00:14:00,116","00:14:02,451","Ah! Aw, too tight."
248,"00:14:02,584","00:14:05,988","- Oh, that's better.
- Oh, great mother of Goola."
249,"00:14:06,122","00:14:07,289",What did you eat for lunch?
250,"00:14:07,422","00:14:09,458","- Flipping!
- No, no, no, no, no."
251,"00:14:09,591","00:14:11,426",I don't want to know.
252,"00:14:13,029","00:14:14,163",Toodle-oo.
253,"00:14:14,296","00:14:15,497",Have a safe trip.
254,"00:14:15,630","00:14:17,432","There go my frequent
flyer miles."
255,"00:14:18,233","00:14:19,868","Oh, oh!"
256,"00:14:20,402","00:14:22,404","I'm feeling a little upset
in the tummy."
257,"00:14:24,740","00:14:26,943","No, I got it under control.
I'm fine now, thanks."
258,"00:14:36,919","00:14:39,588","Ah! Oh, fruit."
259,"00:14:39,721","00:14:44,127","Hey, boy, you know,
this isn't so bad, after all!"
260,"00:14:54,070","00:14:57,305",This is so cool!
261,"00:14:57,439","00:14:58,673",We're going outside the city!
262,"00:14:58,807","00:15:00,243",Didn't anybody ever tell you
263,"00:15:00,375","00:15:01,510","it's dangerous
outside the city?"
264,"00:15:01,643","00:15:02,979","Ah, at least we're in here?"
265,"00:15:03,112","00:15:05,747","Sure. Safely inside
a giant speeding bubble."
266,"00:15:05,882","00:15:08,450","- I feel better already.
- Hey, look!"
267,"00:15:10,086","00:15:12,287","At least there'll be
witnesses when this thing pops."
268,"00:15:12,420","00:15:15,958","Hey, hey.
What's he doing?"
269,"00:15:16,092","00:15:18,560","Maybe she has something
in her eye."
270,"00:15:18,693","00:15:20,495","In a pig's eye, she does."
271,"00:15:20,629","00:15:22,497","Come on, we've got
to get this thing over there."
272,"00:15:22,631","00:15:25,201","- How?
- There!"
273,"00:15:25,333","00:15:27,702","There, lean into it."
274,"00:15:32,407","00:15:34,409",That cheeky monkey.
275,"00:15:34,543","00:15:36,378","- Now what?
- Left!"
276,"00:15:36,511","00:15:39,048","Lean left.
Right. Right."
277,"00:15:39,182","00:15:40,615",Left.
278,"00:15:41,583","00:15:43,552",Now we're moving.
279,"00:15:45,520","00:15:47,355",Aha! We meet again.
280,"00:15:47,489","00:15:49,858","This is it.
Get ready."
281,"00:15:49,992","00:15:51,160","Aye, aye, sir!"
282,"00:15:51,294","00:15:54,197","Now, full chops to the right!"
283,"00:15:54,897","00:15:57,532",Mission accomplished.
284,"00:15:57,666","00:16:00,335","- Whoo!
- What was that?"
285,"00:16:00,468","00:16:01,904","Not bad, kid."
286,"00:16:02,038","00:16:03,940","Where'd you learn
to handle a bubble like that?"
287,"00:16:04,073","00:16:07,342","- In the bathtub, sir.
- And say no more."
288,"00:16:07,475","00:16:08,610","Yes, sir."
289,"00:16:08,743","00:16:10,445",I should have known.
290,"00:16:10,579","00:16:13,515","- Peanut?
- And the Pig?"
291,"00:16:16,185","00:16:17,419",That's more like it.
292,"00:16:17,552","00:16:20,388","Look how happy
she is to see me."
293,"00:16:22,657","00:16:24,093",I don't know.
294,"00:16:25,995","00:16:28,164","What, are you kidding?
She's totally captivated."
295,"00:16:28,297","00:16:29,798",Could be something else.
296,"00:16:29,932","00:16:32,868","Ah, what do you know
about sheer animal magnetism?"
297,"00:16:33,002","00:16:34,870","- It's big.
- That's true."
298,"00:16:35,004","00:16:36,538","- Huge.
- Now you're making sense."
299,"00:16:36,671","00:16:39,175","- Hot, hot!
- Smoking hot!"
300,"00:16:39,308","00:16:41,409","- It's a volcano!
- It's a volcano."
301,"00:16:41,543","00:16:43,045","Hey, I like that."
302,"00:16:43,179","00:16:46,048",It's a volcano!
303,"00:16:48,284","00:16:49,484",That's what I said.
304,"00:16:49,618","00:16:50,752","well, you call that an excuse?"
305,"00:16:50,887","00:16:52,221",We're headed right for it.
306,"00:16:59,594","00:17:00,795",We have to go left.
307,"00:17:01,230","00:17:04,166","Wrong way, wrong way,
wrong way, wrong way."
308,"00:17:05,634","00:17:06,768",I said left.
309,"00:17:06,903","00:17:08,371","- That was left.
- The other left."
310,"00:17:08,503","00:17:10,505","- This is all your fault.
- My fault?"
311,"00:17:10,639","00:17:12,841","Why didn't you use
your ""animal magnetism""?"
312,"00:17:12,975","00:17:16,411","I'll use it later.
Right now, run!"
313,"00:17:23,219","00:17:25,553","Don't breathe, Digg,
Digg, don't breathe."
314,"00:17:27,722","00:17:29,658","- Whoa, whoa!
- Here we go."
315,"00:17:29,791","00:17:31,360",Sorry!
316,"00:17:31,493","00:17:32,761","- Get off!
- I'm trying."
317,"00:17:32,895","00:17:35,131","- I'm hatched already.
- That tickles."
318,"00:17:35,264","00:17:37,133","- Stop.
- You stop!"
319,"00:17:37,266","00:17:40,702","No, we have to stop. Now!"
320,"00:17:48,311","00:17:50,545","Whoa, whoa,
oh, whoa!"
321,"00:17:52,681","00:17:54,116",Pop it!
322,"00:18:02,191","00:18:03,558",We're doomed!
323,"00:18:03,692","00:18:06,195","You gotta admit,
that's some thick Goola Juice."
324,"00:18:07,662","00:18:09,165","Oh, my tummy."
325,"00:18:13,102","00:18:14,536",You did it!
326,"00:18:18,307","00:18:19,874",Hold on.
327,"00:18:26,115","00:18:28,951","We make it thick,
so it'll stick."
328,"00:18:40,429","00:18:41,863",Ah!
329,"00:18:52,507","00:18:55,744","You saved us.
You saved me."
330,"00:18:55,878","00:18:58,847","Yeah, well,
don't mention it, to anyone."
331,"00:18:58,981","00:19:00,682","We wouldn't want
people to talk."
332,"00:19:00,815","00:19:03,085",Does this mean we're friends?
333,"00:19:03,219","00:19:05,254","You see anybody
else around here?"
334,"00:19:06,222","00:19:07,456","No, sir."
335,"00:19:07,589","00:19:10,226","Now, let's find a way
outta here."
336,"00:19:10,359","00:19:12,094",Short and sweet.
337,"00:19:14,997","00:19:17,967","Bubble burst, trapped
inside volcano, send help."
338,"00:19:28,543","00:19:29,778","""And food?"
339,"00:19:30,146","00:19:32,481","""Preferably apple flaps,
Fruity Jacks, and a juice chaser"
340,"00:19:32,614","00:19:34,549","""if you have room,

341,"00:19:36,886","00:19:38,888","""PS, a fruit tart
would be nice, too."""

to see the chef."
343,"00:19:45,827","00:19:47,762","Hey, what's your name anyway?"
344,"00:19:47,897","00:19:50,598","You can call me Digg,
or you can call me Pig."
345,"00:19:50,732","00:19:52,001","Now you can call me P or D,"
346,"00:19:52,134","00:19:53,635","or double-wide on the side,"
347,"00:19:53,768","00:19:55,570","but don't you ever
call me late for dinner!"
348,"00:19:55,703","00:19:58,107","Ah, I had to ask.
Somebody, save me."
349,"00:20:05,181","00:20:07,283","Hey, you mind
turning that down?"
350,"00:20:07,416","00:20:08,583",We're lost.
351,"00:20:10,086","00:20:11,719","That's a perfect way
to get found."
352,"00:20:13,822","00:20:15,157",This way!
353,"00:20:15,291","00:20:16,591",That way?
354,"00:20:16,724","00:20:18,260","There is only one way
to settle this."
355,"00:20:18,394","00:20:20,563",If that's how you want it.
356,"00:20:20,695","00:20:24,366","♪ Goola, Goola, fruity treat,

361,"00:20:44,019","00:20:46,922","- Let's take a look.
- Let's not and say we did."
362,"00:20:53,129","00:20:55,297","Why, no one's been here
in a fruit's age."
363,"00:20:58,033","00:20:59,368",Huh?
364,"00:20:59,502","00:21:01,237",Sir? Sir?

What's all that noise?"
369,"00:21:11,779","00:21:15,117","Ha! These machines
are still working."
370,"00:21:15,251","00:21:16,218",It's impossible.

- Well, my uncle said it."
376,"00:21:25,693","00:21:28,931","Now, if we can just figure out
how to turn them off."

392,"00:22:18,514","00:22:19,915","Oh, fruit."
393,"00:22:25,753","00:22:29,857","- Hoo-hoo, I got one!

- No thanks to you."
398,"00:22:45,174","00:22:46,675","- Me?
- Well, I'm not the one"
399,"00:22:46,808","00:22:48,444","who boogied his booty

402,"00:22:51,614","00:22:53,449","Well, who pulled the pin?"
403,"00:22:53,582","00:22:55,417",Right over the mulcher?
404,"00:23:05,160","00:23:06,996","- Sir?
- How's my hair?"
405,"00:23:07,129","00:23:08,897","- I'm starting to think...
- You got a comb?"
406,"00:23:09,031","00:23:11,000",Maybe we're not really saved.
407,"00:23:11,133","00:23:12,668",What are you talking about?
408,"00:23:12,800","00:23:16,338",Maybe we're captured.

410,"00:23:18,641","00:23:21,377","You can call me Digg,
or you can call me Pig."
411,"00:23:21,510","00:23:22,745",I'll do the talking.
412,"00:23:22,878","00:23:24,446",Who are you?
413,"00:23:24,580","00:23:27,316",Ugh. We asked first.

Could you just say that again?"
418,"00:23:38,294","00:23:42,131","Don't play games with us
or you'll be sorry."
419,"00:23:42,264","00:23:44,400",Maybe they want to eat us.
420,"00:23:48,537","00:23:49,938",Will you look at that?
421,"00:23:50,072","00:23:51,540",It's a bat girl.
422,"00:23:51,674","00:23:55,911","- With a lovely bow.
- I ripped it off a bunny."
423,"00:23:56,045","00:23:57,713",You didn't?
424,"00:23:57,845","00:24:01,250","- Mm-hmm.

428,"00:24:07,956","00:24:10,426","This is supposed to be
an interrogation."
429,"00:24:10,559","00:24:12,628","Oh, well, don't let us
interrupt you."
430,"00:24:12,761","00:24:14,229",Thank you.

432,"00:24:16,031","00:24:17,266",You know it.
433,"00:24:17,399","00:24:20,002","Hey, don't look at me
like that."
434,"00:24:20,135","00:24:22,171",I can talk to whoever I want.
435,"00:24:22,304","00:24:25,808","- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah."
436,"00:24:25,941","00:24:28,744","And don't try to bully me,
Fufu."
437,"00:24:28,877","00:24:30,512",Don't call me that!
438,"00:24:30,646","00:24:34,216","Ooh, Fufu."
439,"00:24:35,250","00:24:36,919",Oops.

around the machines?"

571,"00:30:46,354","00:30:51,194","Something in my eye.
Is it an eyelash?"
572,"00:30:53,963","00:30:56,698",It's a message.
573,"00:30:58,101","00:30:59,735",From Peanut!
574,"00:30:59,868","00:31:01,204",They're alive!
575,"00:31:01,336","00:31:04,406",Isn't that... lucky?
576,"00:31:04,539","00:31:06,175","It must have come
from this way."
577,"00:31:06,308","00:31:07,743",Let's go.
578,"00:31:14,282","00:31:16,919","Ouch, eech, eech, oh..."
579,"00:31:30,365","00:31:32,501",Hey! I'm not a banana.
580,"00:31:39,142","00:31:40,776","- Oops!
- Got you."
581,"00:31:41,576","00:31:43,278","The tremors are happening
more frequently."
582,"00:31:43,411","00:31:44,846","Ouch, ooh!"
583,"00:31:44,981","00:31:46,414",We'd better hurry.
584,"00:31:49,751","00:31:51,087",It's getting brighter.
585,"00:31:51,220","00:31:52,989","Cheek, look."
586,"00:31:53,588","00:31:57,459",Wow. It's beautiful.
587,"00:32:07,003","00:32:10,472","Ooh, better be careful.
There's danger even in beauty."
588,"00:32:10,605","00:32:13,943","That's why I have to keep
my guard up against you."
589,"00:32:23,052","00:32:25,320","You really should stay
close to me."
590,"00:32:38,834","00:32:40,102",Ah!
591,"00:32:40,735","00:32:43,072","Ow, ow, ouch, ooh, ooh..."
592,"00:32:45,507","00:32:46,943",Agh!
593,"00:32:50,779","00:32:52,982","I feel like
we're going the wrong way."
594,"00:32:53,115","00:32:54,416",Nonsense.
595,"00:32:54,549","00:32:56,718","I have an unerring
sense of direction."
596,"00:32:57,452","00:32:58,653","No, really."
597,"00:32:58,787","00:33:00,488","I'm sure
we should be going that way."
598,"00:33:00,622","00:33:02,724",It's just a trick of the light.
599,"00:33:02,858","00:33:04,093",Trust me.
600,"00:33:07,495","00:33:08,697",Cheek!
601,"00:33:08,830","00:33:10,199","For the love of Goola,"
602,"00:33:10,333","00:33:11,633","woman, we're going this way!"
603,"00:33:11,766","00:33:14,402",There's something out there.
604,"00:33:14,536","00:33:16,005",Huh?
605,"00:33:16,438","00:33:18,074",I saw it move.
606,"00:33:19,741","00:33:22,844","Oh, of course you did."
607,"00:33:25,348","00:33:27,149",Another trick of the light?
608,"00:33:30,719","00:33:35,091",Let us proceed.
609,"00:33:51,873","00:33:53,276","Ow, ooh!"
610,"00:33:58,847","00:34:00,615","- What the...
- Huh?"
611,"00:34:02,084","00:34:05,720","- We got them, we got them.
- Not too close."
612,"00:34:06,355","00:34:07,789","Oh, hi."
613,"00:34:08,790","00:34:11,593","- What the fruit?
- Peanut?"
614,"00:34:11,726","00:34:14,796","- Hey, you guys.
- You!"
615,"00:34:14,931","00:34:18,600","Sorry about that.
Can't be too careful out here."
616,"00:34:18,733","00:34:20,702","I hope
you didn't bruise your ego."
617,"00:34:20,835","00:34:23,105","Not everyone's cut out
for this kind of adventure,"
618,"00:34:23,239","00:34:24,706",you know?
619,"00:34:26,108","00:34:27,243",We got your beetle.
620,"00:34:27,376","00:34:28,510",Lucky for you.
621,"00:34:28,643","00:34:29,778","Otherwise, who knows how long"
622,"00:34:29,912","00:34:31,314",you would have been lost?
623,"00:34:31,446","00:34:33,916","- We're not lost.
- And we didn't find you."
624,"00:34:35,717","00:34:37,253",You must be tired and hungry.
625,"00:34:37,752","00:34:40,323","- Affirmative.
- Let's go back to our camp."
626,"00:34:49,731","00:34:51,466",This is your camp?
627,"00:34:53,035","00:34:55,670","We had to make do
with what we could find."
628,"00:34:56,671","00:34:59,507","There's nothing quite
like living off the land."
629,"00:35:04,679","00:35:07,515","Mm, what is
that wonderful aroma?"
630,"00:35:09,784","00:35:12,254","If everyone could please
take a seat."
631,"00:35:14,190","00:35:16,558",Dinner is served.
632,"00:35:17,326","00:35:18,593",Mmm.
633,"00:35:18,727","00:35:20,795","- I call it happy soup.
- Why?"
634,"00:35:20,930","00:35:22,264",Because whenever I taste it
635,"00:35:22,398","00:35:24,333","I get a warm,
happy feeling all over."
636,"00:35:24,833","00:35:27,136","You have outdone yourself,
my friend."
637,"00:35:27,269","00:35:28,670","Why, thank you."
638,"00:35:28,803","00:35:30,839","Do you know where
the best mushrooms come from?"
639,"00:35:30,973","00:35:32,607",You're going to love this.
640,"00:35:32,741","00:35:35,277","- Poop.
- Poop?"
641,"00:35:35,411","00:35:39,647","As in, they're the poop."
642,"00:35:39,781","00:35:42,817","Ugh, that's not funny."
643,"00:35:42,952","00:35:45,254","Nah, they're better than poop."
644,"00:35:45,388","00:35:47,522","Oh, thank Goola."
645,"00:35:47,655","00:35:49,992",These are from bat poop.
646,"00:35:50,126","00:35:52,694","And those bats are
friends of ours."
647,"00:35:53,561","00:35:55,830","To good food,
good friends."
648,"00:35:55,965","00:35:57,866",Present company excluded.
649,"00:35:59,468","00:36:01,904",And googly-eyed fungus.
650,"00:36:03,605","00:36:04,940","Well, that's weird."
651,"00:36:05,074","00:36:06,142",All right.
652,"00:36:06,275","00:36:08,110","There's only one thing
better than this."
653,"00:36:08,643","00:36:11,247","- A mud bath?
- Nope."
654,"00:36:11,380","00:36:13,615",A manicure and foot massage?
655,"00:36:13,748","00:36:16,085",I'll tell you what it is.

728,"00:40:22,298","00:40:23,932",Mr. Pink?
729,"00:40:28,237","00:40:29,804",What are you doing here?
730,"00:40:29,938","00:40:31,407","I'm the one
who should be asking"
731,"00:40:31,540","00:40:34,842","what you're doing so far away
from Goola City."
732,"00:40:42,785","00:40:44,153",Easy for you to say.
733,"00:40:48,424","00:40:52,294",And have you found the problem?
734,"00:40:52,661","00:40:54,430","No, sir. Nothing so far."
735,"00:40:54,963","00:40:57,366","Well, I wouldn't
exactly say nothing."
736,"00:40:58,100","00:40:59,301","- What?
- In fact,"
737,"00:40:59,435","00:41:02,137","I'd say something.
How about you?"
738,"00:41:02,271","00:41:03,806","- Would you say something?
- Something."
739,"00:41:03,939","00:41:06,742","- Peanut?
- My porcine pal here and I"
740,"00:41:06,874","00:41:08,344","have discovered
the problem."
741,"00:41:08,477","00:41:10,779","- That's impossible.
- What did you find?"
742,"00:41:10,913","00:41:12,414",It's the fruit bats.
743,"00:41:12,548","00:41:14,416","They've been monkeying
around with the old machines"
744,"00:41:14,550","00:41:16,085",to disrupt the system.
745,"00:41:16,218","00:41:18,454","I'll have, you know, that figure
of speech is offensive,"
746,"00:41:18,587","00:41:20,022",and entirely accurate.
747,"00:41:20,155","00:41:22,024","Why would the bats want
to disrupt the system?"
748,"00:41:22,157","00:41:25,928","Hmm, they were there
when we originally built it."
749,"00:41:26,061","00:41:27,329",There have been rumors
750,"00:41:27,463","00:41:29,465","the bats are unhappy
that Goola City"
751,"00:41:29,598","00:41:32,401","isn't sharing enough fruits
of their labor."
752,"00:41:32,768","00:41:37,005","You two, have done
very good work indeed."
753,"00:41:51,987","00:41:54,056",Congratulations.
754,"00:41:54,556","00:41:56,258","If all the fruit bats
are in on it,"
755,"00:41:56,392","00:41:57,926","we're going to need
a much bigger team"
756,"00:41:58,060","00:41:59,528",to root them out.
757,"00:41:59,661","00:42:02,531","In that case, I'll lead
you back to Goola City."
758,"00:42:02,664","00:42:04,233","We better send
a messenger beetle back"
759,"00:42:04,366","00:42:05,968","so Moneke
can start preparing."
760,"00:42:06,101","00:42:08,704","Good idea.
Fireworks, fruit sculptures,"
761,"00:42:08,837","00:42:10,205",a ticker tape parade.
762,"00:42:10,339","00:42:12,274","There's a lot to organize
for a hero's return."
763,"00:42:12,408","00:42:14,710",I meant preparing the team.
764,"00:42:14,843","00:42:17,479","Oh, well, that too."
765,"00:42:17,613","00:42:19,047",There's no need.
766,"00:42:19,181","00:42:20,949",The trip won't take us long.
767,"00:42:21,083","00:42:22,217",Just to be safe.
768,"00:42:27,891","00:42:29,391","Oh, look out!"
769,"00:42:30,626","00:42:33,595",We should get underway.
770,"00:42:39,168","00:42:41,703",Tasty.
771,"00:42:42,604","00:42:45,541","The way out should
be somewhere up ahead."
772,"00:42:46,642","00:42:49,913","Say, Flo, I've been thinking.
You, me, Château Mango?"
773,"00:42:50,045","00:42:51,213",Sound like a plan?
774,"00:42:51,346","00:42:52,648",Maybe you've noticed
775,"00:42:52,781","00:42:54,750","we're in the middle
of a fungal jungle"
776,"00:42:54,884","00:42:56,485",Now that I've saved Goola
777,"00:42:56,618","00:42:58,554","you'll want to get on that
schedule as soon as possible."
778,"00:42:58,687","00:43:00,589","Aren't you getting
a little ahead of yourself?"
779,"00:43:00,722","00:43:03,258","Actually, I'm trying to get
ahead of you."
780,"00:43:03,392","00:43:06,094","Careful,
or you might lose your way."
781,"00:43:06,962","00:43:09,364",Not going to happen. You see...
782,"00:43:09,498","00:43:11,633","♪ I'm never lost
when I'm with you ♪"
783,"00:43:13,502","00:43:15,871","Sorry, I've heard
from half the girls in Goola,"
784,"00:43:16,004","00:43:17,773","and I'm not falling
for your song."
785,"00:43:17,907","00:43:19,208",Only half.
786,"00:43:19,341","00:43:22,277","I'm looking for someone
who's sincere."
787,"00:43:22,411","00:43:25,514","- Oh, now, don't be pessimistic.
- Hard working."
788,"00:43:25,647","00:43:28,183","Let me carry
that heavy pack for you."
789,"00:43:29,886","00:43:31,353","- Humble.
- Did I mention?"
790,"00:43:31,487","00:43:33,890","I couldn't have done it
without the pig."
791,"00:43:34,022","00:43:37,559","- Exactly. Someone like Digg?
- You mean in maintenance?"
792,"00:43:37,693","00:43:40,729","It's not what a guy does,
but how he does it that counts."
793,"00:43:46,034","00:43:48,837","I see what you mean.
He's a good egg."
794,"00:43:48,972","00:43:52,708","Just look at him.
He could hatch at any moment."
795,"00:43:52,841","00:43:54,476","Hard as it is to say,"
796,"00:43:54,610","00:43:57,212","I humbly and sincerely
wish you both happiness."
797,"00:43:57,346","00:44:00,582",I didn't say Digg.
798,"00:44:00,716","00:44:03,151",I said someone like Digg.
799,"00:44:03,285","00:44:06,188","Oh, I can dig that."
800,"00:44:07,022","00:44:10,292",I just need a few minutes.
801,"00:44:10,425","00:44:13,262","Forgive me,"
802,"00:44:13,395","00:44:15,999",I'm not as slow as I once was.
803,"00:44:16,164","00:44:17,299",Take your time.
804,"00:44:17,432","00:44:19,067","While you're resting,"
805,"00:44:19,201","00:44:20,536",we'll go look for ourselves.
806,"00:44:20,669","00:44:23,505","And I'll...
and I'll keep a lookout here."
807,"00:44:25,807","00:44:27,209",Looks good to me.
808,"00:44:27,342","00:44:29,311","All righty, then. Let's go."
809,"00:44:30,412","00:44:32,514","You look like you could
use a little support."
810,"00:44:32,648","00:44:34,416",Thanks.
811,"00:44:39,221","00:44:41,823","This way out seems
more like the way in."
812,"00:44:49,264","00:44:51,667","- Help!
- That sounded like..."
813,"00:44:51,800","00:44:56,071","Gee, maybe the old fella fell
down and can't get up!"
814,"00:44:57,606","00:45:00,809","Well, if he fell down,
he sure did get up."
815,"00:45:01,076","00:45:02,744",The Bats have him!
816,"00:45:02,879","00:45:04,479",Catch them! Ow.
817,"00:45:07,749","00:45:09,184",What the...
818,"00:45:12,187","00:45:13,522",Look out!
819,"00:45:13,655","00:45:16,059","It's days like this
that give days like this"
820,"00:45:16,191","00:45:17,826",a bad reputation.
821,"00:45:17,961","00:45:19,828","Hey, we gotta get out of here."
822,"00:45:22,130","00:45:23,565",Peanut!
823,"00:45:24,533","00:45:26,035",Pull!
824,"00:45:36,645","00:45:38,413",Cheek!
825,"00:46:04,506","00:46:05,741","See, like that."
826,"00:46:05,874","00:46:07,542","Parry, duck.
Dueling with a fungus."
827,"00:46:07,676","00:46:10,579","Leap, swing,
and totally outmatched."
828,"00:46:15,985","00:46:17,586","Oh, great."
829,"00:46:23,092","00:46:25,327","Hey, stick around, will ya?"
830,"00:46:25,460","00:46:26,595",What's he doing?
831,"00:46:30,632","00:46:32,935","Come on, come on,
come on, come on, over here."
832,"00:46:37,006","00:46:38,740",All aboard!
833,"00:46:38,874","00:46:40,342","Peanut, that's brilliant."
834,"00:46:40,475","00:46:42,344",I figure bunnies like to hop.
835,"00:46:42,477","00:46:44,613",Hold this for me.
836,"00:46:45,380","00:46:46,815",First class all the way.
837,"00:46:55,624","00:46:57,960","- Boopsie.
- Oops!"
838,"00:46:58,094","00:47:01,430","Oops!
I'll show you, oops!"
839,"00:47:05,200","00:47:07,003","- You're riding?
- I'm there."
840,"00:47:20,016","00:47:21,918",Fancy meeting you here.
841,"00:47:25,287","00:47:27,222","- Touchdown.
- Anybody ever tell you"
842,"00:47:27,355","00:47:29,291","you have a future
in cannonballs?"
843,"00:47:29,424","00:47:31,259",Let's find Flo!
844,"00:47:36,832","00:47:38,101",There she is.
845,"00:47:38,233","00:47:39,701",I got you.
846,"00:47:40,435","00:47:43,005","We hope you enjoyed
your flight today."
847,"00:47:43,139","00:47:44,840",It really worked.
848,"00:47:46,274","00:47:48,343",I prefer flying jumbos myself.
849,"00:47:48,477","00:47:51,580","- This pig can fly.
- Oh, shucks."
850,"00:47:55,184","00:47:56,485","Hey, it's Mr. Pink."
851,"00:47:56,618","00:47:57,853","- You!
- That's right."
852,"00:47:57,987","00:48:00,355","We made it out.
No thanks to you."
853,"00:48:00,489","00:48:03,159","I saw the bats drop him.
He needed my help."
854,"00:48:03,291","00:48:05,061","Oh, are you hurt?"
855,"00:48:05,194","00:48:07,063",No.
856,"00:48:07,196","00:48:08,630","Just old, my dear."
857,"00:48:08,764","00:48:10,967",Good thing I held on to this.
858,"00:48:11,100","00:48:13,236","Ah, my trusty."
859,"00:48:13,368","00:48:14,569",Thank you.
860,"00:48:14,703","00:48:16,538","We were just
coming to find you."
861,"00:48:16,671","00:48:18,840","Luckily for us, we had Peanut."
862,"00:48:19,242","00:48:21,409",He sure saved my bacon.
863,"00:48:21,543","00:48:23,913",Your uncle would be proud.
864,"00:48:24,046","00:48:25,547",Don't get carried away.
865,"00:48:25,680","00:48:27,950","Once was enough, I assure you."
866,"00:48:28,350","00:48:30,385",I was just saving my own skin.
867,"00:48:30,519","00:48:33,421","Now we know you were right
about the bats."
868,"00:48:33,555","00:48:37,059","They obviously used me
to try and trap you."
869,"00:48:37,193","00:48:39,761",Let's get moving.
870,"00:48:54,944","00:48:56,411",Ew!
871,"00:48:56,545","00:48:58,580","Don't be sweating on me, hog!"
872,"00:48:58,713","00:49:01,650",B... b... but it's so hot.
873,"00:49:03,752","00:49:06,621","That's some spring
in your step, Mr. Pink."
874,"00:49:07,190","00:49:11,227","Oh, yes, the volcanic warmth
agrees with me."
875,"00:49:12,627","00:49:13,930",Look at that!
876,"00:49:14,063","00:49:16,232","Is that a bromance
in the making I see?"
877,"00:49:16,398","00:49:19,202","I'm starting to get a funny
feeling about all this."
878,"00:49:19,334","00:49:21,837","Me too.
Something stinks."
879,"00:49:21,971","00:49:24,706","- That's just you.
- Oh yeah."
880,"00:49:24,840","00:49:27,843","What do we really know about
that old sloth anyway?"
881,"00:49:27,977","00:49:32,148","He's one of the original Goola
founders and a living legend."
882,"00:49:32,281","00:49:33,950","Oh, that!"
883,"00:49:39,956","00:49:42,291","Now, I know what they mean by
if you can't stand the heat,"
884,"00:49:42,424","00:49:43,725",stay out of the volcano.
885,"00:49:43,859","00:49:46,428","What's the matter?
Can't you take it?"
886,"00:49:47,230","00:49:49,764","Well, you know, it's not the
heat, it's the stupidity."
887,"00:49:49,899","00:49:52,201","I think we're going deeper
into the volcano."
888,"00:49:52,335","00:49:53,970",Away from Goola City.
889,"00:49:54,103","00:49:55,905",It's just lava pockets.
890,"00:49:56,038","00:49:58,573","We have to pass through them
on the way out."
891,"00:49:59,008","00:50:00,709","Ah, see there."
892,"00:50:00,842","00:50:04,412",The journey is almost over.
893,"00:50:07,449","00:50:09,151",Where are we?
894,"00:50:14,257","00:50:16,058",Not the exit that's for sure.
895,"00:50:16,192","00:50:20,729",The Central Cone!
896,"00:50:20,862","00:50:23,132","Did I mention I have
a nose for danger?"
897,"00:50:23,266","00:50:25,767","That looks like the Goola juice
bubble maker."
898,"00:50:28,004","00:50:30,006",Only that's no juice bubble.
899,"00:50:30,139","00:50:31,539",That's lava.
900,"00:50:33,075","00:50:35,378",The lava bubbles are so heavy
901,"00:50:35,510","00:50:37,846","they're weighing
down the entire system."
902,"00:50:37,980","00:50:40,082","They're what's causing
the island to sink."
903,"00:50:41,483","00:50:44,753","Let's get out of here.
We have to tell Uncle Moneke."
904,"00:50:49,926","00:50:53,728","Whoa!
Now that's an avalanche!"
905,"00:50:54,429","00:50:57,266","Hey! The boulder
almost flattened me!"
906,"00:50:57,400","00:50:59,434","Flattened us, you mean?"
907,"00:50:59,567","00:51:02,204","Sorry about that, Boss!"
908,"00:51:02,338","00:51:05,174","Boss?
You?"
909,"00:51:07,842","00:51:11,746","And you! You're all
in on the secret plot together."
910,"00:51:12,381","00:51:14,716","Not bad for an old fossil, eh?"
911,"00:51:14,849","00:51:16,785","It was just a matter of
modifying some of"
912,"00:51:16,919","00:51:20,289","the original Goola machinery
that had been abandoned."
913,"00:51:20,423","00:51:23,858","- But why?
- Oh. But why?"
914,"00:51:23,993","00:51:27,495","Because I saved Goola,
it was me."
915,"00:51:27,629","00:51:31,334","- I built all these machines.
- Impressive."
916,"00:51:31,466","00:51:33,169",Ah! Just saying.
917,"00:51:33,302","00:51:36,571","But your great grand-ape
took all the credit"
918,"00:51:36,705","00:51:38,341",and all the glory.
919,"00:51:38,473","00:51:40,809",You monkeys live like kings.
920,"00:51:40,943","00:51:44,080","While all I got was
a golden pineapple"
921,"00:51:44,213","00:51:48,884","and a pat on the back!
No one knows what I built,"
922,"00:51:49,018","00:51:53,488","but they'll know
when I destroy it."
923,"00:51:53,621","00:51:57,826","What do you mean destroy it?
That wasn't part of the deal."
924,"00:51:57,960","00:51:59,728",No?
925,"00:51:59,861","00:52:03,665","Always a little late to
the party aren't you, my boy?"
926,"00:52:04,333","00:52:06,601",That is why I chose you.
927,"00:52:06,735","00:52:08,304","We were only supposed
to make them think"
928,"00:52:08,437","00:52:09,838",the island was sinking.
929,"00:52:09,972","00:52:12,540","Then we'd save everyone
and rule Goola together."
930,"00:52:14,410","00:52:18,546","As if I would share power
with another cheeky monkey."
931,"00:52:18,680","00:52:20,615",Never!
932,"00:52:20,749","00:52:22,251",You betrayed me.
933,"00:52:22,385","00:52:24,719","Don't take it so hard.
You betrayed me and we..."
934,"00:52:24,853","00:52:27,023","- never mind.
- But if the island sinks"
935,"00:52:27,156","00:52:29,724","what about all the Goola fruit
you promised us?"
936,"00:52:29,858","00:52:32,228","Don't you see?
He tricked all of you."
937,"00:52:32,361","00:52:33,528",Everyone.
938,"00:52:33,661","00:52:36,598","- No fruit?
- No juice?"
939,"00:52:36,731","00:52:39,001",No anything.
940,"00:52:51,013","00:52:53,516","You didn't think I was planning
to go down with"
941,"00:52:53,648","00:52:55,617","the rest of the island,
did you?"
942,"00:52:55,750","00:52:58,421","After Goola sinks,
I will rebuild"
943,"00:52:58,553","00:53:01,057",on the volcano that remains.
944,"00:53:16,138","00:53:17,973","Hurry, Hurry, hurry!"
945,"00:53:18,107","00:53:20,608","Let's go, let's go!"
946,"00:53:20,742","00:53:23,645","Stupid.
This is not my job."
947,"00:53:25,381","00:53:31,353","Revenge is the sweetest
fruit of all."
948,"00:53:31,921","00:53:34,390","Wait a minute,
didn't you forget something?"
949,"00:53:35,124","00:53:38,194","- Pardon?
- Um, uh..."
950,"00:53:38,327","00:53:40,162",I'm too young to die?
951,"00:53:40,963","00:53:43,665","- Goodbye!
- Stop him!"
952,"00:53:48,971","00:53:53,142","- Target acquired.
- Locked and loaded."
953,"00:53:54,477","00:53:57,179","Dive, dive, dive!"
954,"00:54:03,018","00:54:05,387",Ouch. What are we doing?
955,"00:54:05,521","00:54:07,523","- Huh?
- We got wings."
956,"00:54:07,655","00:54:09,992","Oh, so?"
957,"00:54:10,126","00:54:12,161",Oh!
958,"00:54:12,561","00:54:13,929",Let's get out of here.
959,"00:54:14,063","00:54:16,631","You're smarter
than you look, Fufu."
960,"00:54:23,439","00:54:25,141",We have to climb.
961,"00:54:27,510","00:54:31,380","Guys, guys.
Guys!"
962,"00:54:33,249","00:54:35,618","- What's the matter?
- Pigs can't climb"
963,"00:54:35,750","00:54:38,888","Last I heard
they can't fly, either."
964,"00:54:39,889","00:54:41,756","Hey, yeah!"
965,"00:54:41,891","00:54:43,492",let's get shakin' bacon.
966,"00:54:43,626","00:54:45,161","Yeah. After you, sir."
967,"00:54:45,294","00:54:47,029",Huh?
968,"00:54:48,631","00:54:50,032",Yah-hoo!
969,"00:54:50,166","00:54:53,202","There we are, all for
one and one for all."
970,"00:54:53,335","00:54:54,537",That's my motto.
971,"00:54:54,669","00:54:56,138",Since when?
972,"00:54:56,272","00:54:57,805",Since right now.
973,"00:54:57,940","00:55:00,442",There's nowhere left to go.
974,"00:55:03,212","00:55:05,114",I hope that works out for you.
975,"00:55:06,549","00:55:09,084",So this is it.
976,"00:55:09,218","00:55:12,754","Somehow, I always imagined when
the end finally came,"
977,"00:55:12,888","00:55:14,789",I'd be somewhere else.
978,"00:55:16,158","00:55:19,228","Come on.
We can't let this beat us."
979,"00:55:19,361","00:55:20,728",What can we do?
980,"00:55:20,862","00:55:23,132",We can look death in the eye.
981,"00:55:23,899","00:55:25,267",We can laugh.
982,"00:55:28,270","00:55:30,105","- We can kiss.
- Well..."
983,"00:55:30,239","00:55:33,409","Oh, great Goola!
Hurry up and end it!"
984,"00:55:34,543","00:55:35,877",What?
985,"00:55:36,011","00:55:37,546","I don't think,
this pipe is load-bearing."
986,"00:55:37,680","00:55:38,813","- Who cares?
- But... but... but..."
987,"00:55:38,948","00:55:40,182","- Kind of busy.
- It might..."
988,"00:55:40,316","00:55:42,117","You ever hear
the phrase now or never?"
989,"00:55:43,252","00:55:45,020",Break.
990,"00:55:55,264","00:55:56,532",Bubbles.
991,"00:55:56,665","00:55:59,834","Gotcha.
They're too small."
992,"00:55:59,969","00:56:03,305","Stop grabbing!
Let them stick to you."
993,"00:56:15,451","00:56:17,086",Phew.
994,"00:56:17,852","00:56:21,390","Madam, how do you do?"
995,"00:56:21,523","00:56:22,658",Oops.
996,"00:56:28,964","00:56:30,466",It's working.
997,"00:56:33,636","00:56:35,170",We're alive?
998,"00:56:37,406","00:56:38,741",That's right.
999,"00:56:38,873","00:56:41,410",I fly all the time!
1000,"00:56:42,877","00:56:44,313","If we had booked early,"
1001,"00:56:44,446","00:56:46,382","we could have gotten better
seats."
1002,"00:56:46,515","00:56:48,884","- Oh, Peanut.
- Did someone say peanuts."
1003,"00:56:49,018","00:56:51,553","Nuts!
You're all nuts!"
1004,"00:56:54,856","00:56:57,893","- Look!
- It's going down."
1005,"00:56:58,027","00:56:59,561",Uncle Moneke.
1006,"00:57:01,863","00:57:05,467","- Oh, dear!
- I don't know how to swim."
1007,"00:57:05,601","00:57:08,170",Everyone.
1008,"00:57:09,438","00:57:12,041","Well, at least we made it."
1009,"00:57:14,209","00:57:16,578",We have to do something.
1010,"00:57:16,712","00:57:19,281",Do what? It's all over.
1011,"00:57:21,617","00:57:23,519",It really is over.
1012,"00:57:23,652","00:57:26,388","Now I'll never get
the penthouse office."
1013,"00:57:27,089","00:57:30,092","It's not over. It's not over
unless we give up."
1014,"00:57:30,225","00:57:32,328","And unless you're not the
monkey I think you are."
1015,"00:57:32,461","00:57:35,698","You'll never give up,
you're too obtuse to give up."
1016,"00:57:36,365","00:57:38,866",You think I'm obtuse? Hm...
1017,"00:57:39,001","00:57:41,804","Getting your hands
a little dirty now, Peanut,"
1018,"00:57:41,937","00:57:44,139","is good preparation
for later."
1019,"00:57:46,275","00:57:48,777","We need to go that way.
Can you do it?"
1020,"00:57:49,445","00:57:53,015","No problem.
I got a full tank."
1021,"00:57:53,148","00:57:55,651",What are you doing?
1022,"00:57:56,719","00:58:00,489","- We have to break the machines.
- Are you crazy?"
1023,"00:58:00,622","00:58:02,791",You'll get us all killed.
1024,"00:58:14,503","00:58:15,938",That was a mistake.
1025,"00:58:16,071","00:58:18,873","This is how
you break something."
1026,"00:58:22,311","00:58:24,446","You two don't know what
you're doing."
1027,"00:58:24,580","00:58:27,082","I'll show you how to disable
this machine."
1028,"00:58:36,692","00:58:38,360",Let's do it!
1029,"00:58:38,494","00:58:41,497","- Back it up, Pig!
- Okeydokey, sir."
1030,"00:58:46,068","00:58:48,303",I still have faith in Peanut.
1031,"00:58:48,437","00:58:50,839","- I don't know how to swim.
- Pink?"
1032,"00:59:03,685","00:59:04,920",It's working.
1033,"00:59:07,856","00:59:09,558",What?
1034,"00:59:10,125","00:59:13,429",Ooh! fun!
1035,"00:59:23,372","00:59:26,642","If we get this, it should
finish off the whole system."
1036,"00:59:26,775","00:59:28,177",I don't think so.
1037,"00:59:28,310","00:59:31,079","I won't let you stop what
I've begun."
1038,"00:59:31,213","00:59:32,916",You're too late.
1039,"00:59:33,048","00:59:34,216","This is the beginning
of the end."
1040,"00:59:34,349","00:59:37,252",Or the end of the end.
1041,"00:59:37,386","00:59:40,122","Or maybe it's the end
of the beginning?"
1042,"00:59:42,090","00:59:45,961","Eat lava, monkey boy!"
1043,"00:59:50,098","00:59:51,667",My bacon is baking.
1044,"00:59:51,800","00:59:53,869","I hope it's true
that girls like fried bananas."
1045,"00:59:54,002","00:59:56,071","Do you think this is
covered in Goola's health plan?"
1046,"00:59:56,205","00:59:57,973",Are you kidding? No way.
1047,"00:59:58,106","00:59:59,575",I know. I wrote it.
1048,"00:59:59,708","01:00:01,076",Hey! We're steering it!
1049,"01:00:01,210","01:00:04,213","Other way, other way.
No. Yes."
1050,"01:00:04,346","01:00:06,381","- No.
- Sir."
1051,"01:00:06,515","01:00:08,183",They are heading for the lava!
1052,"01:00:08,317","01:00:09,818","- Right, go right.
- Go right."
1053,"01:00:09,953","01:00:11,086","- My left.
- Go left?"
1054,"01:00:11,220","01:00:12,788","- Right!
- Oh, no!"
1055,"01:00:12,922","01:00:14,556","Cheek, jump!"
1056,"01:00:16,625","01:00:18,260",Whee!
1057,"01:00:18,393","01:00:20,629","- I said left.
- You said right!"
1058,"01:00:24,233","01:00:26,034",Peanut!
1059,"01:00:27,269","01:00:29,137",You got any marshmallows?
1060,"01:00:30,439","01:00:32,341",Going up.
1061,"01:00:32,474","01:00:35,711","I know these machines better
than anyone."
1062,"01:00:39,848","01:00:41,149","Next floor lingerie,"
1063,"01:00:41,283","01:00:43,619","sporting goods,
and deadly lava balls."
1064,"01:00:45,721","01:00:47,122","Looks like we're having
a special run"
1065,"01:00:47,256","01:00:49,157",on those lava balls.
1066,"01:00:51,995","01:00:53,662","Oh, fruit! No!"
1067,"01:00:53,795","01:00:57,499","Buddy, I said, we make it
thick so it'll stick."
1068,"01:00:58,534","01:00:59,568",Ow!
1069,"01:00:59,701","01:01:02,371","Oh.
Flying gets easier and easier."
1070,"01:01:06,241","01:01:07,911","- Partner?
- Partners."
1071,"01:01:08,043","01:01:09,645",Charge!
1072,"01:01:09,778","01:01:12,147",Now try and stop me.
1073,"01:01:24,159","01:01:25,561",You asked for it!
1074,"01:01:25,694","01:01:27,629","♪ Goola, Goola fruity treat ♪"
1075,"01:01:27,763","01:01:29,731","♪ For blocking lava
can't beat me ♪"
1076,"01:01:29,865","01:01:32,401","♪ Especially when
I use my seat ♪"
1077,"01:01:33,602","01:01:34,803",No!
1078,"01:01:45,814","01:01:47,115",This way.
1079,"01:01:59,761","01:02:00,964",It stopped!
1080,"01:02:01,096","01:02:03,565",Hooray!
1081,"01:02:11,406","01:02:14,876","- Oh, no.
- Oh please."
1082,"01:02:19,247","01:02:22,184","Well, you got to hand it
to the big chimp."
1083,"01:02:23,052","01:02:24,586",Nah.
1084,"01:02:56,284","01:02:58,854",Incoming!
1085,"01:03:06,628","01:03:07,863",Jump!
1086,"01:03:08,563","01:03:10,198","Hey, what the fruit
are you doing?"
1087,"01:03:10,332","01:03:12,567","- No problemo.
- Yes problemo."
1088,"01:03:18,340","01:03:20,175",Peanut!
1089,"01:03:23,311","01:03:24,546",They're okay.
1090,"01:03:24,680","01:03:27,683","That is one
lucky monkey."
1091,"01:03:27,816","01:03:32,220","- Nice work, pig.
- Why thank you, monkey."
1092,"01:03:40,662","01:03:42,431",Lookout!
1093,"01:03:53,642","01:03:58,847","Why you...!
This isn't finished!"
1094,"01:03:58,981","01:04:00,749",You want to bet?
1095,"01:04:03,785","01:04:06,455",No!
1096,"01:04:11,226","01:04:12,794",He's in the juice now.
1097,"01:04:12,929","01:04:14,863",About time he got canned.
1098,"01:04:16,398","01:04:17,833",Now what?
1099,"01:04:18,533","01:04:19,835",Need a lift?
1100,"01:04:19,969","01:04:21,137",You came back.
1101,"01:04:21,269","01:04:22,905",What's the catch?
1102,"01:04:25,540","01:04:27,809","She's kind of sweet
on you."
1103,"01:04:32,014","01:04:34,316","Well, you can't blame her."
1104,"01:04:34,449","01:04:37,486","Not you, banana breath.
Him!"
1105,"01:04:39,122","01:04:41,224","- Me?
- Him?"
1106,"01:04:41,356","01:04:44,493","I like the strong,
silent type."
1107,"01:04:46,896","01:04:49,865","- Oh, I see.
- Still friends?"
1108,"01:05:09,986","01:05:12,255",The nose knows.
1109,"01:05:23,698","01:05:26,468",Why?
1110,"01:05:26,601","01:05:29,671","I had enough
of playing second banana"
1111,"01:05:29,805","01:05:32,909","to a bunch of
simple minded simians."
1112,"01:05:33,042","01:05:34,576","I'm sorry, old friend,"
1113,"01:05:34,709","01:05:37,579","but I order you to further
service Goola City."
1114,"01:05:37,712","01:05:40,382","You will help restore it
to its former glory"
1115,"01:05:40,515","01:05:43,286","by cleaning up the mess
you made."
1116,"01:05:43,418","01:05:45,554",You order me?
1117,"01:05:48,690","01:05:51,227",Uncle Moneke is a bad...
1118,"01:05:58,633","01:06:02,771","Congratulations to you all
for saving Goola City."
1119,"01:06:02,905","01:06:07,043","- Ah, about that.
- Yes, Peanut?"
1120,"01:06:07,176","01:06:08,945","We can do better
than that."
1121,"01:06:59,028","01:07:02,397","Peanut, today, I am proud to be
a monkey's uncle."
1122,"01:07:07,203","01:07:09,871",Now this belongs to you.
1123,"01:07:13,342","01:07:15,710",Ooh! Gee.
1124,"01:07:20,548","01:07:23,219","Hey crybaby,
get back to work."
1125,"01:07:23,352","01:07:25,654","Uncle Moneke, what can I say?"
1126,"01:07:25,787","01:07:28,723","I made a copy for myself
years ago."
1127,"01:07:30,825","01:07:32,827","Oh, you cheeky monkey."
1128,"01:07:36,498","01:07:38,234","Not so long ago,"
1129,"01:07:38,367","01:07:41,870","the beautiful island of Goola
began sinking into the sea"
1130,"01:07:42,004","01:07:44,539","until a particularly
clever monkey"
1131,"01:07:44,673","01:07:47,575",and his friends saved the day.
1132,"01:07:48,710","01:07:50,745",Hold the fruit!
1133,"01:07:50,880","01:07:52,814","Aren't you
forgetting something?"
1134,"01:07:53,416","01:07:55,051",That's more like it.
1135,"01:08:01,390","01:08:03,359","- Pardon me.
- Hey, buddy."
1136,"01:08:03,491","01:08:04,626",My buddy.
1137,"01:08:04,759","01:08:05,895",Mind if I cut in?
1138,"01:08:06,028","01:08:07,696","- Well...
- Of course."
