Uh. Uh, okay, okay.

39
00:02:41,420 --> 00:02:42,489
Hmm.

40
00:02:42,625 --> 00:02:45,560
Okay, our target
is Maxime Le Mal,

41
00:02:45,695 --> 00:02:48,228
one of the Anti-Villain
League's most wanted.

42
00:02:48,364 --> 00:02:51,399
And, trust me, a real jerk.

43
00:02:51,534 --> 00:02:54,871
So, there is no room
for error. Got it?

44
00:02:55,006 --> 00:02:56,541
Sí, boss.

45
00:03:09,315 --> 00:03:10,315
Phil, Ron!

46
00:03:17,623 --> 00:03:19,390
Ah.

47
00:03:19,525 --> 00:03:21,992
Ah!

48
00:03:30,336 --> 00:03:34,205
Kids can be so cruel, but
Maxime can be even crueler.

49
00:03:38,877 --> 00:03:41,378
Ho, ho, ho. Well, well, well.

50
00:03:41,513 --> 00:03:42,778
Look who it is.

51
00:03:42,914 --> 00:03:45,784
If it isn't Gru-ser the Loser.

52
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:49,553
Well, if it isn't Maxime
Le Mal. You look...

53
00:03:49,688 --> 00:03:52,522
Magnificent? Yes, I know.

54
00:03:52,658 --> 00:03:54,256
What did you think, huh?

55
00:03:54,392 --> 00:03:57,399
I was going to look like a
bald loser with a dad bod?

56
00:03:57,534 --> 00:04:00,597
Oops. Looks like you
beat me to it, no?

57
00:04:02,875 --> 00:04:05,035
Ooh. Ooh!

58
00:04:05,535 --> 00:04:06,535
Oh.

59
00:04:06,574 --> 00:04:08,206
It's good to laugh, no?

60
00:04:09,779 --> 00:04:13,010
Anyway, you remember my
girlfriend, Valentina?

61
00:04:13,145 --> 00:04:16,220
She was captain of the
Femme Fatale cheer squad,

62
00:04:16,356 --> 00:04:19,723
and the most popular
girl at school, huh?

63
00:04:19,859 --> 00:04:21,289
I remember.

64
00:04:21,424 --> 00:04:23,421
Good to see you, Valentina.

65
00:04:26,066 --> 00:04:28,425
What happened, Gru?

66
00:04:28,561 --> 00:04:34,105
All your dreams of becoming a famous
villain, they go poof-poof, huh?

67
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:35,965
Well, I don't know if you know,

68
00:04:36,101 --> 00:04:38,070
but I did manage
to steal the moon.

69
00:04:38,206 --> 00:04:39,305
Really?

70
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:41,612
You mean, that moon?

71
00:04:43,108 --> 00:04:45,646
Is this on?

72
00:04:45,781 --> 00:04:48,320
Can I have everyone's
attention, please?

73
00:04:48,455 --> 00:04:53,116
Good evening and welcome,
Lycée Pas Bon alumni.

74
00:04:54,252 --> 00:04:56,417
Now, we're going to
kick off the festivities

75
00:04:56,553 --> 00:05:00,293
by announcing the winner
of our most coveted award,

76
00:05:00,428 --> 00:05:02,327
The Golden Alumni.

77
00:05:04,137 --> 00:05:07,330
And so, without further ado,

78
00:05:07,466 --> 00:05:13,273
the winner of this year's
Golden Alumni is, uh...

79
00:05:13,409 --> 00:05:15,846
Oh, my favorite student.

80
00:05:15,982 --> 00:05:17,514
Maxime Le Mal.

81
00:05:17,650 --> 00:05:20,445
What? Are you kidding
me? Thank you. Thank you.

82
00:05:20,580 --> 00:05:22,613
Merci. Merci beaucoup.

83
00:05:22,749 --> 00:05:23,819
No, you don't have to.

84
00:05:29,458 --> 00:05:32,059
Oh, thank you. Thank you.

85
00:05:32,194 --> 00:05:33,195
Thank you.

86
00:05:33,330 --> 00:05:34,795
I'm sure you all know

87
00:05:34,931 --> 00:05:38,101
that I have something
very big in the works.

88
00:05:38,237 --> 00:05:43,333
Now, some of you laughed at my
childhood obsession with cockroaches.

89
00:05:43,469 --> 00:05:48,539
But I quickly learned that they
are a miracle of evolution.

90
00:05:50,143 --> 00:05:53,141
And I have found a way
to harness the strength

91
00:05:53,277 --> 00:05:56,082
and the speed and
the... What is the word?

92
00:05:56,218 --> 00:06:01,150
"Unsquishability" of the most
powerful creature on the planet.

93
00:06:01,286 --> 00:06:06,557
Which makes me indestructible
and unstoppable!

94
00:06:06,693 --> 00:06:09,828
Maxime! Maxime! Maxime!

95
00:06:09,964 --> 00:06:13,537
Behold the power
of the cockroach!

96
00:06:41,702 --> 00:06:45,763
So, my sad little friend, what
do you say about that, huh?

97
00:06:45,898 --> 00:06:48,672
Well, I'd say you're...

98
00:06:48,807 --> 00:06:52,973
under arrest, courtesy of
the Anti-Villain League.

99
00:06:53,108 --> 00:06:55,837
Oh... I don't
think so, mon ami.

100
00:06:55,973 --> 00:06:57,539
Oh, yeah? Goop grenade!

101
00:07:03,757 --> 00:07:04,786
No!

102
00:07:07,489 --> 00:07:09,419
Hi-yah!

103
00:07:09,555 --> 00:07:10,790
Move in.

104
00:07:10,926 --> 00:07:12,509
AVL! Everybody, freeze!

105
00:07:12,533 --> 00:07:14,466
- Stay where you are.
- Move!

106
00:07:23,238 --> 00:07:24,470
Ha!

107
00:07:24,605 --> 00:07:25,675
Stay there!

108
00:07:26,704 --> 00:07:27,743
Freeze!

109
00:07:34,184 --> 00:07:35,678
Gotcha!

110
00:07:35,813 --> 00:07:37,285
No, no, no! No!

111
00:07:37,420 --> 00:07:38,620
This is not happening!

112
00:07:38,755 --> 00:07:40,421
C'est impossible.

113
00:07:40,556 --> 00:07:42,461
Get your hands off of me!

114
00:07:43,696 --> 00:07:46,062
I am commanding
you to let me go.

115
00:07:46,197 --> 00:07:47,493
So long, Maxime!

116
00:07:47,629 --> 00:07:49,563
Who's the loser now?

117
00:07:49,698 --> 00:07:52,596
Loser, loser, loser!

118
00:08:02,544 --> 00:08:04,549
This is not over!

119
00:08:05,979 --> 00:08:07,813
You won't always have the AVL

120
00:08:07,948 --> 00:08:09,618
to fight your
battles, you coward!

121
00:08:09,753 --> 00:08:12,824
Mark my words! I
will exterminate you!

122
00:08:18,995 --> 00:08:22,996
Not, uh... Not scary at all.

123
00:08:38,910 --> 00:08:40,276
Hello, everybody!

124
00:08:40,412 --> 00:08:42,014
Gru, what's up? Yay, Gru!

125
00:08:42,150 --> 00:08:43,982
Hey, Gru. I'm so
happy you're here!

126
00:08:44,117 --> 00:08:46,124
What's shaking in the Gru house?

127
00:08:46,259 --> 00:08:48,126
Look what I taught Lucky.

128
00:08:48,261 --> 00:08:50,386
Lucky, sit.

129
00:08:53,166 --> 00:08:55,891
Aw, Lucky, I said sit.

130
00:08:58,636 --> 00:09:02,066
Well, it is only
his first lesson.

131
00:09:02,202 --> 00:09:04,704
Uh, maybe we practice
outside from now on.

132
00:09:04,839 --> 00:09:07,279
There's my favorite husband!

133
00:09:07,414 --> 00:09:09,247
Did you remember
to get the milk?

134
00:09:09,382 --> 00:09:11,210
Well, yes. They had a few kinds.

135
00:09:11,345 --> 00:09:13,717
They got the almond milk,
soy milk, hemp milk,

136
00:09:13,852 --> 00:09:16,517
oat milk, goat milk,
chocolate milk, half-and-half,

137
00:09:16,653 --> 00:09:19,090
powdered, and of magnesia.

138
00:09:19,226 --> 00:09:21,383
What about regular milk?

139
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:23,718
No, they don't
make that anymore.

140
00:09:23,854 --> 00:09:24,854
Oh!

141
00:09:24,988 --> 00:09:26,596
Wait a minute.

142
00:09:26,731 --> 00:09:28,790
One, two, three girls.

143
00:09:28,925 --> 00:09:30,633
One wife.

144
00:09:30,769 --> 00:09:33,394
Something is missing.

145
00:09:33,530 --> 00:09:36,198
No, I think that's
all of us. Yeah.

146
00:09:36,333 --> 00:09:37,967
You know what? I
keep forgetting...

147
00:09:38,103 --> 00:09:39,578
this guy!

148
00:09:41,810 --> 00:09:44,044
Oh, ho, ho! There's my boy!

149
00:09:44,909 --> 00:09:46,250
There he is!

150
00:09:46,386 --> 00:09:47,780
Ah, coochy, coochy, coochy.

151
00:09:47,916 --> 00:09:50,786
Where is Daddy's hug?

152
00:09:50,922 --> 00:09:54,087
Oh, looks like somebody's
a little cranky!

153
00:09:54,222 --> 00:09:59,294
Behind that sourpuss, I
know you love your dada!

154
00:09:59,429 --> 00:10:00,657
Go on, say it.

155
00:10:00,793 --> 00:10:03,261
Dada. Dada.

156
00:10:03,397 --> 00:10:05,635
Yes, of course he
loves you! He just...

157
00:10:05,771 --> 00:10:07,898
He just doesn't
show it on his face,

158
00:10:08,034 --> 00:10:10,141
or with his body language.

159
00:10:10,277 --> 00:10:12,036
Right, Gru Jr? Come on.

160
00:10:12,171 --> 00:10:14,038
Show Daddy how
much you love him.

161
00:10:14,174 --> 00:10:17,775
Oh, I know what
will make you happy!

162
00:10:17,910 --> 00:10:21,149
Mmm, Bahama Medley!

163
00:10:22,950 --> 00:10:25,815
No? It's from The Bahamas.

164
00:10:25,951 --> 00:10:27,487
All of them. Look.

165
00:10:27,622 --> 00:10:30,127
Oh, so yummy!

166
00:10:30,263 --> 00:10:32,191
Mmm, mmm, mmm.

167
00:10:34,262 --> 00:10:36,959
Oh, that really tastes
like The Bahamas!

168
00:10:37,095 --> 00:10:39,028
See? He loves his daddy!

169
00:10:39,164 --> 00:10:41,104
He's sharing.

170
00:10:43,606 --> 00:10:45,071
Phil, Ralph, Ron!

171
00:10:45,206 --> 00:10:47,503
Hup, hup, hup!

172
00:10:48,113 --> 00:10:49,274
Hup!

173
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:52,743
Pistachio. Yeah, cashew.

174
00:10:56,452 --> 00:10:57,986
Gotcha!

175
00:11:12,029 --> 00:11:13,137
Thanks, guys.

176
00:11:17,067 --> 00:11:18,241
Ramsbottom?

177
00:11:18,377 --> 00:11:19,810
Bottom.

178
00:11:20,879 --> 00:11:23,539
I need a word with you
both. Sure, but what...

179
00:11:23,674 --> 00:11:25,740
I'm sorry. There's
no time for chitchat.

180
00:11:25,875 --> 00:11:29,050
Maxime Le Mal has sent
you a message from prison.

181
00:11:31,149 --> 00:11:32,623
Bonjour, Gru.

182
00:11:32,758 --> 00:11:35,156
I know you can hear
me, so hear this.

183
00:11:35,291 --> 00:11:38,886
You think you can humiliate
me and get away with it? Yes?

184
00:11:39,022 --> 00:11:40,723
But, no!

185
00:11:40,859 --> 00:11:43,694
When I break out of prison,
I'm coming for my revenge, Gru!

186
00:11:43,830 --> 00:11:47,965
But this time, I won't
go so easy on you!

187
00:11:48,101 --> 00:11:50,340
And I know where you live!

188
00:11:50,475 --> 00:11:54,306
So you better sleep with one eye
open, because you can't hide from me!

189
00:11:55,206 --> 00:11:57,441
Sweet dreams, Gru-ser!

190
00:11:59,479 --> 00:12:01,816
Don't worry. He can't
get out of there.

191
00:12:01,951 --> 00:12:04,346
It's a maximum security prison.

192
00:12:04,482 --> 00:12:06,719
Ah, yes, well, um...

193
00:12:06,855 --> 00:12:08,091
he escaped yesterday.

194
00:12:08,227 --> 00:12:09,391
What?

195
00:12:09,526 --> 00:12:11,220
Leave our home?

196
00:12:11,356 --> 00:12:12,925
Oh, no. You're gonna love it.

197
00:12:13,061 --> 00:12:15,257
It's called "the safe house,"

198
00:12:15,392 --> 00:12:18,660
and it's fun, and it's safe, and
it's fantastic and we're going.

199
00:12:18,796 --> 00:12:21,031
Yeah, you'll get a new
room, go to a new school.

200
00:12:21,166 --> 00:12:22,763
It'll be fun, right?

201
00:12:22,899 --> 00:12:24,672
Everything's gonna
be new. We love new!

202
00:12:24,808 --> 00:12:26,201
What about all my friends?

203
00:12:26,337 --> 00:12:27,443
You'll make new friends.

204
00:12:27,578 --> 00:12:29,112
Probably better ones.

205
00:12:30,408 --> 00:12:31,882
I can't believe this.

206
00:12:32,017 --> 00:12:34,616
Yes, yes. Lot of
emotions. Big life change.

207
00:12:34,752 --> 00:12:36,320
Less talking, more walking.

208
00:12:36,455 --> 00:12:38,152
Come on, here we go.

209
00:12:47,595 --> 00:12:51,926
I'm sorry you can't
go with us, Lucky.

210
00:12:53,968 --> 00:12:55,730
Take good care of him.

211
00:12:56,870 --> 00:12:58,368
Be good, Lucky!

212
00:12:58,504 --> 00:13:01,813
Don't forget to
practice your tricks!

213
00:13:06,119 --> 00:13:08,783
We'll arrive at the AVL
safe house in a few hours.

214
00:13:08,918 --> 00:13:10,916
Mayflower is a lovely town.

215
00:13:11,052 --> 00:13:13,624
A lovely, safe, boring town.

216
00:13:13,759 --> 00:13:15,452
Trust me, it is
for the best, Gru.

217
00:13:15,587 --> 00:13:18,594
And what about
Grandma and Uncle Dru?

218
00:13:18,729 --> 00:13:22,833
I'm sorry. No one can know of
your whereabouts, not even family.

219
00:13:22,969 --> 00:13:25,002
Bingo! There's
your silver lining.

220
00:13:25,137 --> 00:13:27,664
And you promise to take
care of the other Minions?

221
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:30,672
They'll be safe and sound
at AVL Headquarters.

222
00:13:30,808 --> 00:13:32,839
I have big plans for them.

223
00:13:32,975 --> 00:13:35,308
Good luck with that.

224
00:13:53,830 --> 00:13:56,362
That is it!

225
00:14:04,508 --> 00:14:06,306
Quiet!

226
00:14:07,780 --> 00:14:11,242
You are now on Carl's bus.

227
00:14:11,378 --> 00:14:14,644
And Carl is a
longtime AVL employee

228
00:14:14,780 --> 00:14:17,549
whose retirement benefits
are almost vested.

229
00:14:17,684 --> 00:14:22,794
So, while on Carl's bus,
you follow Carl's rules.

230
00:14:22,929 --> 00:14:27,025
No shenanigans, no
antics and no tomfoolery.

231
00:14:27,160 --> 00:14:28,322
Tom?

232
00:14:28,457 --> 00:14:30,167
So this ends now.

233
00:14:30,303 --> 00:14:35,001
Or you're gonna see a side
of Carl you do not wanna see.

234
00:14:35,136 --> 00:14:38,302
Do I make myself clear?

235
00:14:38,438 --> 00:14:39,971
Bazooka!

236
00:14:45,679 --> 00:14:48,078
This won't st...

237
00:14:48,214 --> 00:14:49,881
Carl does not like this!

238
00:14:50,017 --> 00:14:52,097
Watch your hands. What are
you doing? Who's pinching?

239
00:14:52,182 --> 00:14:53,584
No, no!

240
00:14:59,031 --> 00:15:02,223
Here we are. The
town of Mayflower.

241
00:15:02,358 --> 00:15:06,702
This safe house has been used to
protect our agents for decades now.

242
00:15:06,838 --> 00:15:08,235
Whoa, look at that place.

243
00:15:08,370 --> 00:15:11,208
Wow, look at these
lawns. The flowers.

244
00:15:11,344 --> 00:15:14,537
- Whoa! That is cool.
- Are we really gonna live here?

245
00:15:14,673 --> 00:15:16,380
Look at that fountain. Whoa!

246
00:15:16,515 --> 00:15:18,280
Awesome.

247
00:15:18,416 --> 00:15:20,186
Ooh, ooh, ooh, is that one ours?

248
00:15:20,210 --> 00:15:21,813
Hey, hey.

249
00:15:21,949 --> 00:15:23,699
- Whoa, look at that.
- Ooh, that's pretty.

250
00:15:23,723 --> 00:15:25,288
I could get used to this.

251
00:15:28,424 --> 00:15:31,391
Ooh, it looks like a
princess lives there.

252
00:15:32,157 --> 00:15:33,789
And here it is.

253
00:15:35,194 --> 00:15:37,067
Your new home.

254
00:15:42,374 --> 00:15:43,770
Oh.

255
00:15:43,906 --> 00:15:45,777
Hmm, no fountain.

256
00:15:45,912 --> 00:15:48,278
I'm sure it's gonna be great.

257
00:15:48,414 --> 00:15:49,705
Come on.

258
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:52,242
Silas says that there
is a pool in the back.

259
00:15:52,377 --> 00:15:53,809
That'll be fun, huh?

260
00:16:00,623 --> 00:16:05,126
Wow, it's so cold
and uninviting.

261
00:16:05,262 --> 00:16:07,193
But in a homey
kind of way. What?

262
00:16:07,329 --> 00:16:10,557
Yes, everything here
is AVL standard.

263
00:16:10,693 --> 00:16:14,335
What it lacks in comfort, it more
than makes up for in functionality.

264
00:16:14,470 --> 00:16:17,970
There's even a fully
automated lockdown mode.

265
00:16:18,105 --> 00:16:19,172
Isn't that fun?

266
00:16:19,307 --> 00:16:21,509
Ooh, full lockdown mode.

267
00:16:21,644 --> 00:16:23,113
Yay.

268
00:16:23,249 --> 00:16:25,449
It has a vending machine. Oh!

269
00:16:25,585 --> 00:16:27,243
I love this place!

270
00:16:27,379 --> 00:16:29,452
Ooh.

271
00:16:33,616 --> 00:16:34,822
Eh, eh.

272
00:16:38,158 --> 00:16:39,731
This will be great.

273
00:16:39,866 --> 00:16:41,662
All right, now down to business.

274
00:16:41,797 --> 00:16:45,300
For your own safety, you'll
all be assuming new identities.

275
00:16:45,435 --> 00:16:48,002
New identities? Is
that really necessary?

276
00:16:48,138 --> 00:16:50,038
It's not up for debate, Gru.

277
00:16:50,174 --> 00:16:52,670
Now, you are a solar
panel salesman.

278
00:16:52,805 --> 00:16:56,306
Lucy, you're a hairstylist
at an upscale salon.

279
00:16:56,442 --> 00:17:00,144
A hairstylist? Yes, jackpot!

280
00:17:00,279 --> 00:17:02,986
Silas, did you choose that because
you knew I cut my own hair,

281
00:17:03,121 --> 00:17:04,781
and that I would
totally rock at this?

282
00:17:05,358 --> 00:17:06,787
No.

283
00:17:06,923 --> 00:17:08,487
"Chet Cunningham."

284
00:17:08,623 --> 00:17:11,328
Ah, that's got a
nice ring to it.

285
00:17:11,464 --> 00:17:12,464
Girls.

286
00:17:13,061 --> 00:17:15,927
Cool. I'm Blair.

287
00:17:16,062 --> 00:17:17,292
"Britney"?

288
00:17:17,427 --> 00:17:18,794
My name is Bree?

289
00:17:18,929 --> 00:17:21,198
Oh, come on. There are
worse names than Bree.

290
00:17:21,334 --> 00:17:23,002
Yeah, like Blanche.

291
00:17:23,137 --> 00:17:24,933
Yes, Margo.

292
00:17:25,068 --> 00:17:28,176
Blanche? Ugh, that
is a terrible name.

293
00:17:28,311 --> 00:17:30,848
Imagine being named Blanche.

294
00:17:30,983 --> 00:17:32,710
Truly, I cannot
think of a worse...

295
00:17:33,777 --> 00:17:35,147
My name's Blanche, isn't it?

296
00:17:35,282 --> 00:17:36,511
Yep.

297
00:17:36,647 --> 00:17:38,552
Well, I'll get used to it.

298
00:17:38,687 --> 00:17:41,523
Well, why don't you girls
go and pick out your rooms

299
00:17:41,659 --> 00:17:44,392
while I have a word
with your parents?

300
00:17:46,396 --> 00:17:48,422
Yes, I didn't want to
frighten the girls,

301
00:17:48,558 --> 00:17:52,501
but it is absolutely crucial you keep
your true identities under wraps.

302
00:17:52,637 --> 00:17:56,399
Gru, you're going to have to
try to not be so "Gru-ish."

303
00:17:56,535 --> 00:17:58,565
What is that supposed to mean?

304
00:17:58,701 --> 00:18:02,471
Well, I'm just saying you tend to
stand out in a crowd, that's all.

305
00:18:02,606 --> 00:18:06,208
You know... like the way you're
always cranky and irritable.

306
00:18:06,343 --> 00:18:09,911
And how you make things a bit
awkward for everyone around you.

307
00:18:10,046 --> 00:18:12,589
You do do that. I
mean, you know...

308
00:18:12,724 --> 00:18:14,125
Okay, enough.

309
00:18:14,260 --> 00:18:16,924
I don't make people
awkward or uncomfortable.

310
00:18:17,060 --> 00:18:18,861
I'm very comforting.

311
00:18:18,996 --> 00:18:20,863
Like a nice meat loaf.

312
00:18:20,998 --> 00:18:22,925
I'm pretty delicious.

313
00:18:26,903 --> 00:18:29,839
This is not awkward. You're the
ones who are making it awkward.

314
00:18:29,975 --> 00:18:32,142
Gru, you have to blend in.

315
00:18:32,278 --> 00:18:34,072
Your family's
lives are at stake.

316
00:18:34,207 --> 00:18:35,575
You understand?

317
00:18:35,710 --> 00:18:37,350
Of course, yes.
Fully understand.

318
00:18:37,382 --> 00:18:39,976
We would do anything to
keep our family safe. Yeah.

319
00:18:40,112 --> 00:18:43,420
Right, well, I'll be in
contact when this is all over.

320
00:18:43,555 --> 00:18:48,489
Until then, capturing Maxime
Le Mal is our top priority.

321
00:18:49,925 --> 00:18:50,953
Stay safe.

322
00:18:53,530 --> 00:18:56,326
You know what, Gru,
maybe this isn't so bad.

323
00:18:56,461 --> 00:19:00,534
We need a break from chasing down
villains and dangerous missions, right?

324
00:19:00,670 --> 00:19:03,002
We can actually be a
normal family for once.

325
00:19:03,137 --> 00:19:08,309
And I can finally spend some
real bonding time with the baby.

326
00:19:08,444 --> 00:19:11,081
It's gonna be
great. Right, pal?

327
00:19:11,217 --> 00:19:13,445
Who's got your
nose? Who's got...

328
00:19:13,580 --> 00:19:15,978
He's got my nose.

329
00:19:17,289 --> 00:19:20,490
Quite the grip there.
That kid is strong.

330
00:19:29,964 --> 00:19:30,993
Ah.

331
00:19:47,719 --> 00:19:50,185
♪ Let's be free, baby
And cruise the world ♪

332
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:51,649

Whoo-hoo!

341
00:20:12,144 --> 00:20:14,669
No, I love you.

342
00:20:14,805 --> 00:20:17,673
Thank you, my beautiful army.

343
00:20:17,809 --> 00:20:20,878
Maxime's back, baby.

344
00:20:23,253 --> 00:20:28,358
And a special merci beaucoup to everyone
who helped me break out of AVL prison.

345
00:20:28,493 --> 00:20:30,927
Todd and Linda, where are
you? Where are you? Yes.

346
00:20:31,063 --> 00:20:32,689
For distracting the guards.

347
00:20:32,824 --> 00:20:34,727
Oh, très magnifique. Yeah!

348
00:20:35,526 --> 00:20:37,398
Now, silence!

349
00:20:37,534 --> 00:20:40,428
We must make Gru suffer
for arresting me.

350
00:20:42,039 --> 00:20:43,505
And what better way

351
00:20:43,641 --> 00:20:46,708
than to take away from him
his precious little baby.

352
00:20:46,843 --> 00:20:49,480
I want to take that baby.

353
00:20:49,616 --> 00:20:50,748
Whoa.

354
00:20:50,883 --> 00:20:51,883
Yeah!

355
00:20:51,949 --> 00:20:53,280
Oh, Maxime.

356
00:20:53,415 --> 00:20:55,549
No, no. Wait, wait. Not Maxime.

357
00:20:55,685 --> 00:20:59,585
What if I start going
by "Cockroach Man," huh?

358
00:20:59,721 --> 00:21:02,057
Little on the nose,
but it is very clear.

359
00:21:02,193 --> 00:21:03,957
It's good, no? Ugh.

360
00:21:04,093 --> 00:21:08,293
I am not calling you that stupid
name, but I love this evil plan.

361
00:21:08,429 --> 00:21:10,234
Well, Gru has it coming.

362
00:21:10,370 --> 00:21:13,069
He humiliated me in front
of the whole school.

363
00:21:13,204 --> 00:21:16,306
I had my trophy and everything.

364
00:21:16,441 --> 00:21:19,401
But now the game begins.

365
00:21:19,537 --> 00:21:24,812
He runs and hides like the mouse,
and we find him like the cat.

366
00:21:24,948 --> 00:21:26,812
Game on.

367
00:21:40,492 --> 00:21:44,060
Okay, we've got Chet's famous,
super cheesy scrambled eggs.

368
00:21:44,196 --> 00:21:47,435
And Blanche's famous bacon
that spells your name.

369
00:21:47,571 --> 00:21:51,439
Here you go, Britney.

370
00:21:51,575 --> 00:21:55,505
Wait, I can't say
my name is Britney.

371
00:21:55,640 --> 00:21:57,339
That would be a lie.

372
00:21:57,474 --> 00:21:58,744
Yes.

373
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:01,349
But we aren't
"stupposed" to lie.

374
00:22:01,484 --> 00:22:03,144
Don't think of it as lying.

375
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:05,681
Think of it as
high-stakes pretending.

376
00:22:05,817 --> 00:22:07,884
Well, I'm not going to.

377
00:22:08,019 --> 00:22:09,956
Bah, it's just a
little white lie.

378
00:22:10,092 --> 00:22:10,861
No.

379
00:22:10,996 --> 00:22:12,225
Agnes, as your father,

380
00:22:12,360 --> 00:22:13,927
I command you to lie.

381
00:22:14,062 --> 00:22:15,062
No.

382
00:22:15,165 --> 00:22:16,961
- Yes, lie.
- Mm-mmm.

383
00:22:17,096 --> 00:22:19,702
You are walking on
thin ice, little lady.

384
00:22:19,837 --> 00:22:20,903
Hmm!

385
00:22:22,607 --> 00:22:25,140
Why can't you be more
like your sister Edith?

386
00:22:25,275 --> 00:22:26,909
She lies all the time.

387
00:22:27,044 --> 00:22:28,112
No, I don't.

388
00:22:28,247 --> 00:22:30,376
See? See? She's lying right now.

389
00:22:30,512 --> 00:22:32,212
Beautifully, I might add.

390
00:22:32,347 --> 00:22:33,547
Okay, you guys.

391
00:22:33,683 --> 00:22:35,203
This is our first
big day in Mayflower,

392
00:22:35,254 --> 00:22:37,515
and I say we make
it a great one.

393
00:22:37,651 --> 00:22:39,323
Right, Chet Jr?

394
00:22:39,459 --> 00:22:42,423
Whoo-hoo, Mayflower.
Yes! Whoo-hoo.

395
00:22:42,558 --> 00:22:44,494
We're gonna be late for karate.

396
00:22:44,629 --> 00:22:46,230
And you have to get
Margo to school. Ah.

397
00:22:46,365 --> 00:22:48,629
It's gonna be
awesome. Ugh. Yay.

398
00:22:48,765 --> 00:22:51,226
Hey, you just have to
put yourself out there,

399
00:22:51,361 --> 00:22:55,033
and I promise Mayflower
will love Chet Cunningham.

400
00:22:55,168 --> 00:22:58,072
Well, they're gonna love
him just as much as I do.

401
00:22:58,207 --> 00:23:02,570
And you, little man, are gonna have
so much fun with your daddy today.

402
00:23:03,808 --> 00:23:06,642
Yep, just you and Dada.

403
00:23:06,777 --> 00:23:08,784
Come on, say it. Dada.

404
00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:10,454
Dada.

405
00:23:14,422 --> 00:23:16,427
Gonna be a fun day.

406
00:23:28,001 --> 00:23:30,501
Hup, hup, hup!

407
00:23:30,636 --> 00:23:32,839
Hup, hup, hup, hup!

408
00:23:34,209 --> 00:23:35,041
Buddies.

409
00:23:35,177 --> 00:23:36,737
Okay.

410
00:23:41,519 --> 00:23:43,385
Thanks a lot, guys.
Ah, ha-ha, buddy.

411
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:45,951
Check ya.

412
00:23:48,017 --> 00:23:50,420
All right. Thanks, hon.

413
00:23:50,556 --> 00:23:51,891
Bye. Bye.

414
00:23:52,725 --> 00:23:54,731
Look, Margo, neighbors.

415
00:23:54,867 --> 00:23:55,996
Hello!

416
00:23:56,131 --> 00:23:57,426
Hmm?

417
00:23:57,562 --> 00:23:58,661
Come on.

418
00:23:58,796 --> 00:24:00,396
You got this, Chet.

419
00:24:02,332 --> 00:24:05,371
I'm your new neighbor,
Chet Cunningham.

420
00:24:05,507 --> 00:24:07,269
Uh-huh. Perry Prescott.

421
00:24:07,404 --> 00:24:11,507
So, what, uh, brings you
to the neighborhood, Chet?

422
00:24:11,643 --> 00:24:14,277
Well, uh...

423
00:24:14,413 --> 00:24:18,817
Solar panels. That's
it. I sell solar panels.

424
00:24:18,952 --> 00:24:21,583
Have you joined the
solar revolution?

425
00:24:21,718 --> 00:24:23,324
Yeah, no.

426
00:24:23,459 --> 00:24:25,258
Uh, I think I'm good.

427
00:24:25,393 --> 00:24:26,426
Good to know.

428
00:24:26,562 --> 00:24:28,263
So, what do you do, Perry?

429
00:24:28,398 --> 00:24:30,367
I own Prescott Motors.

430
00:24:30,502 --> 00:24:33,928
The largest auto
dealer in the state.

431
00:24:34,064 --> 00:24:36,667
Wow, that's impressive.

432
00:24:36,803 --> 00:24:38,732
This is my daughter Margo.

433
00:24:38,867 --> 00:24:39,867
Bree, Dad.

434
00:24:39,938 --> 00:24:43,644
Ah, yes. Yes. Did I say "Margo"?

435
00:24:43,780 --> 00:24:45,642
It's funny, because
I was thinking...

436
00:24:45,777 --> 00:24:49,451
I was thinking about a fish I
once had as a pet, named Margo.

437
00:24:49,587 --> 00:24:53,788
Who lived in the
pond and then died.

438
00:24:54,651 --> 00:24:55,651
Uh.

439
00:24:55,753 --> 00:24:58,453
Anyway, I, uh...

440
00:24:58,588 --> 00:25:02,126
I'm about to take Bree to
school for her first day.

441
00:25:02,261 --> 00:25:05,035
Yeah, I was about to take
Poppy to school, so...

442
00:25:05,170 --> 00:25:07,501
Poppy. Hello, Poppy.

443
00:25:07,637 --> 00:25:09,634
That's a fun name to say.

444
00:25:09,770 --> 00:25:11,366
You want to carpool with us?

445
00:25:11,943 --> 00:25:12,943
No.

446
00:25:13,038 --> 00:25:15,010
You could be friends with Bree.

447
00:25:15,146 --> 00:25:16,170
Right, Bree?

448
00:25:16,305 --> 00:25:18,472
You don't have any friends.

449
00:25:21,182 --> 00:25:24,315
Well, love to chitchat,
Chet, but she's got school,

450
00:25:24,451 --> 00:25:27,250
and I'm meeting some pals over
at the country club, so...

451
00:25:27,385 --> 00:25:29,356
Ooh, country club. That
sounds like a lot of fun.

452
00:25:29,491 --> 00:25:35,566
If I were ever invited to a country
club, I am sure that I would love it.

453
00:25:37,135 --> 00:25:40,799
Yeah, well, we really have to get
going, so nice meeting you, Chet.

454
00:25:42,966 --> 00:25:48,276
Okay, cool. Any time you want to
hang out, just hit me up with a text.

455
00:25:48,412 --> 00:25:50,079
He's gonna text me.

456
00:25:50,215 --> 00:25:51,714
That was painful.

457
00:25:56,785 --> 00:25:58,415
You'll see. By lunchtime,

458
00:25:58,551 --> 00:26:02,192
you will have forgotten all
about your old, lousy friends.

459
00:26:02,328 --> 00:26:04,562
Mmm, not so sure about that.

460
00:26:09,230 --> 00:26:11,761
Right? Oh, my gosh.

461
00:26:11,896 --> 00:26:13,063
Not my problem, bro.

462
00:26:13,198 --> 00:26:16,699
Hey, honey, you got this.

463
00:26:16,835 --> 00:26:17,835
You're smart.

464
00:26:17,935 --> 00:26:19,135
You're funny.

465
00:26:19,271 --> 00:26:20,936
What's there to
worry about, right?

466
00:26:21,072 --> 00:26:23,438
They're gonna love you.

467
00:26:24,578 --> 00:26:25,847
Thanks, Gru.

468
00:26:27,912 --> 00:26:29,279
Bye-bye.

469
00:26:30,851 --> 00:26:33,615
Oh, please let them love you.

470
00:26:35,785 --> 00:26:36,825
Ooh!

471
00:26:38,328 --> 00:26:40,290
Hey, Poppy.

472
00:26:44,729 --> 00:26:46,170
Eh...

473
00:26:47,800 --> 00:26:50,133
Come on. Hey. Move it!

474
00:26:50,269 --> 00:26:53,439
Sorry. My bad. I'm
going. All right.

475
00:26:53,574 --> 00:26:54,909
I'm going.

476
00:26:57,182 --> 00:26:59,144
Ooh, glassos.

477
00:27:12,388 --> 00:27:13,895
No, no, no. Sit. Sit.

478
00:27:15,968 --> 00:27:16,997
No.

479
00:27:26,278 --> 00:27:27,403
All right, gentlemen.

480
00:27:27,970 --> 00:27:29,009
Fall in.

481
00:27:30,981 --> 00:27:33,478
Some of you may be
wondering why you're here.

482
00:27:33,614 --> 00:27:34,846
Uh, sí.

483
00:27:34,981 --> 00:27:36,850
As you may or may not know,

484
00:27:36,985 --> 00:27:38,779
I was recently called
out of retirement

485
00:27:38,914 --> 00:27:41,490
to head up the AVL's new
top-secret initiative

486
00:27:41,625 --> 00:27:44,152
to take down Maxime Le Mal.

487
00:27:44,288 --> 00:27:46,020
And that's where you come in.

488
00:27:46,155 --> 00:27:47,459
We need volunteers.

489
00:27:47,595 --> 00:27:49,392
Me! Me! Me!

490
00:27:49,528 --> 00:27:51,827
We are looking for the
strong, the mighty...

491
00:27:51,962 --> 00:27:52,995
Ooh.

492
00:27:53,131 --> 00:27:54,535
The fearless. Uh, nope.

493
00:27:54,671 --> 00:27:57,135
We need the best of the best.

494
00:27:57,270 --> 00:28:00,172
So, who's it going to be?

495
00:28:02,239 --> 00:28:04,341
Yes, nice work, gentlemen.

496
00:28:08,119 --> 00:28:12,020
The AVL is known for cutting-edge
weapons and vehicles,

497
00:28:12,155 --> 00:28:15,385
but now we are developing
cutting-edge agents.

498
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:18,889
And I can think of no
better guinea pigs than you.

499
00:28:19,025 --> 00:28:20,427
Guinea pigs!

500
00:28:22,032 --> 00:28:25,329
You will be the first
to test our super serum.

501
00:28:25,465 --> 00:28:27,871
Designed to transform
you into elite agents

502
00:28:28,007 --> 00:28:32,501
with powers and abilities far
beyond those of mortal men.

503
00:28:33,940 --> 00:28:36,104
Or you might just explode.

504
00:28:36,239 --> 00:28:37,675
We don't really know.

505
00:28:37,811 --> 00:28:40,450
Eh? Huh?

506
00:28:40,585 --> 00:28:43,052
Oh, ah.

507
00:28:43,187 --> 00:28:44,381
Hey.

508
00:29:19,023 --> 00:29:24,622
Ladies and gentlemen, I
give you the Mega Minions.

509
00:29:31,896 --> 00:29:33,227
Cool.

510
00:29:33,363 --> 00:29:35,738
Aw, you guys look adorable.

511
00:29:35,874 --> 00:29:37,667
And... And really
tough and scary.

512
00:29:37,803 --> 00:29:41,142
I'll look even better when
I have a black belt. Hi-yah!

513
00:29:41,277 --> 00:29:44,241
Ooh, ooh! I'm gonna break
a brick with my head.

514
00:29:44,377 --> 00:29:46,245
That's the spirit. Oh!

515
00:29:47,679 --> 00:29:49,784
Oh, okay. Now, go have
fun while I'm at work.

516
00:29:49,919 --> 00:29:53,353
Blair and Britney. Right? Mmm.

517
00:29:53,489 --> 00:29:54,489
We will.

518
00:29:54,590 --> 00:29:56,654
Okay. Bye, Mom.

519
00:29:56,790 --> 00:29:57,955
Bye.

520
00:29:58,090 --> 00:29:59,126
Got ya.

521
00:29:59,726 --> 00:30:00,923
Hi-yah!

522
00:30:01,059 --> 00:30:02,299
Circle up, people.

523
00:30:05,263 --> 00:30:07,099
Show respect for your sensei.

524
00:30:07,234 --> 00:30:09,763
Yes, Sensei O'Sullivan.

525
00:30:11,275 --> 00:30:12,337
Hai!

526
00:30:16,280 --> 00:30:19,174
You, Moscovitch, didn't I
tell you to cut that hair?

527
00:30:19,309 --> 00:30:21,075
You look like a sheepdog.

528
00:30:21,210 --> 00:30:22,484
Sorry, Sensei.

529
00:30:24,521 --> 00:30:27,984
Now, we have two new students today
ready to begin their journey...

530
00:30:28,120 --> 00:30:31,087
Hi-yah! To awesomeness.

531
00:30:31,223 --> 00:30:33,322
You, tiny girl.

532
00:30:33,457 --> 00:30:35,624
Step forward and
tell us your name.

533
00:30:36,268 --> 00:30:37,268
Um...

534
00:30:37,403 --> 00:30:39,331
It's Britney.

535
00:30:40,098 --> 00:30:42,730
Uh, m-my name?

536
00:30:44,343 --> 00:30:46,335
I can't.

537
00:30:46,470 --> 00:30:48,808
There's no "can't" in karate.

538
00:30:48,944 --> 00:30:51,514
Ten push-ups after class!

539
00:30:51,649 --> 00:30:53,148
Hey, that's not fair.

540
00:30:53,283 --> 00:30:58,311
Huh! Ha! You better not be
talking back to your sensei.

541
00:30:58,446 --> 00:31:00,023
Hi-yah!

542
00:31:00,159 --> 00:31:03,553
Now, are you ready to tell
us your name and participate?

543
00:31:04,262 --> 00:31:05,324
Mmm.

544
00:31:05,925 --> 00:31:07,825
I guess not.

545
00:31:07,961 --> 00:31:11,859
Then why don't you go sit in the
corner of disgrace and reflection

546
00:31:11,994 --> 00:31:14,828
and think about what kind
of person you wanna be?

547
00:31:19,604 --> 00:31:23,709
Now, am I gonna get
any trouble from you?

548
00:31:23,844 --> 00:31:25,471
Yeah, probably.

549
00:31:25,607 --> 00:31:27,015
Excuse me?

550
00:31:27,150 --> 00:31:29,442
If you think I'm above
fighting children,

551
00:31:29,578 --> 00:31:31,889
you picked the wrong dojo.

552
00:31:36,355 --> 00:31:38,219
Hi-yah, hi-yah,
hi-yah! Hi-yah!

553
00:31:38,354 --> 00:31:40,429
Ha!

554
00:31:47,034 --> 00:31:48,735
Yeah!

555
00:31:48,871 --> 00:31:51,068
That was for my sister.

556
00:31:54,371 --> 00:31:57,772
You broke my pinkie toe.

557
00:31:57,908 --> 00:32:02,382
That's gonna be a
lot of push-ups.

558
00:32:02,518 --> 00:32:05,547
Okay, then put this over
here, then the hair gel.

559
00:32:05,683 --> 00:32:07,689
Hair spray. Oh, uh,
Mrs. Cunningham?

560
00:32:07,825 --> 00:32:09,188
Oh! Uh, yeah. Hi.

561
00:32:09,323 --> 00:32:12,253
I have to say, this
is quite a résumé.

562
00:32:12,388 --> 00:32:14,060
Well, what can I say?

563
00:32:14,196 --> 00:32:15,658
I'm good at what I do.

564
00:32:15,793 --> 00:32:18,626
Well, you are exactly
what we need here.

565
00:32:18,762 --> 00:32:21,294
Lot of vain, demanding
divas in this town.

566
00:32:24,402 --> 00:32:26,307
I have a hair emergency, people.

567
00:32:27,010 --> 00:32:28,345
Where's what's-her-name?

568
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:29,943
Remy? Rhonda?

569
00:32:30,079 --> 00:32:31,813
Oh, Melora, I'm so sorry.

570
00:32:31,949 --> 00:32:33,408
Rachel's on maternity leave.

571
00:32:33,543 --> 00:32:36,075
What? Oh, that is unacceptable.

572
00:32:36,211 --> 00:32:40,987
But you are in luck, because
Blanche here is fantastic.

573
00:32:41,123 --> 00:32:43,257
Perfect. I'll be in my chair.

574
00:32:44,455 --> 00:32:46,263
Okay, kiddo, you're up.

575
00:32:50,264 --> 00:32:54,104
So, Melora, what
are we thinking?

576
00:32:54,239 --> 00:32:57,239
What if we just wet the hair
and let it dry in the air?

577
00:32:57,375 --> 00:32:59,832
Let nature do its
thang... you know?

578
00:32:59,968 --> 00:33:02,375
No, no, no, no. That
style is dead to me.

579
00:33:02,510 --> 00:33:05,205
It's-It's time for
a whole new Melora.

580
00:33:05,341 --> 00:33:07,516
I want this.

581
00:33:07,651 --> 00:33:08,978
Wow.

582
00:33:09,113 --> 00:33:11,644
Wow. Um...

583
00:33:11,780 --> 00:33:15,556
Okay, let's start with color?

584
00:33:15,692 --> 00:33:17,995
Yes, color. Because that's
what you start with.

585
00:33:20,092 --> 00:33:21,625
Little of this.

586
00:33:22,325 --> 00:33:23,825
Some of that.

587
00:33:24,769 --> 00:33:25,800
Ooh, that's pretty.

588
00:33:25,936 --> 00:33:26,960
This isn't so hard.

589
00:33:29,639 --> 00:33:30,733
Uh...

590
00:33:34,974 --> 00:33:36,640
What?

591
00:33:37,607 --> 00:33:39,547
Should it be smoking?

592
00:33:39,683 --> 00:33:40,981
Yes. Uh-huh.

593
00:33:41,116 --> 00:33:42,844
Smoking means it's working.

594
00:33:51,226 --> 00:33:52,519
What's going on?

595
00:33:52,654 --> 00:33:54,394
Perfect. No one panic.

596
00:33:55,324 --> 00:33:57,067
Call 911.

597
00:34:02,234 --> 00:34:03,502
Quickly, quickly.

598
00:34:04,903 --> 00:34:07,407
Oh... wonder where
they're going.

599
00:34:11,982 --> 00:34:14,547
Voilà! My latest creation.

600
00:34:14,683 --> 00:34:18,445
All of my transformation powers
in a handheld design, huh?

601
00:34:18,580 --> 00:34:20,213
Ay! I love it.

602
00:34:20,348 --> 00:34:22,926
Oh, and look at the little
antenna. That's so cute.

603
00:34:23,061 --> 00:34:25,260
It's not supposed
to be cute. No.

604
00:34:25,395 --> 00:34:28,055
I'm going for intimidating.
Terrifying, even.

605
00:34:28,191 --> 00:34:32,362
Now, all I have to do is find
that walking boiled potato,

606
00:34:32,498 --> 00:34:34,903
and his baby is mine.

607
00:34:35,039 --> 00:34:36,766
Check this out.

608
00:34:41,139 --> 00:34:42,269
Whoa!

609
00:34:50,080 --> 00:34:54,091
No, I kid you not. I'm
being serious... Whoa!

610
00:34:56,352 --> 00:34:57,391
Whoa!

611
00:35:11,536 --> 00:35:14,144
Oh, this is going to be so good.

612
00:35:25,456 --> 00:35:28,989
Okay, Daddy is
officially exhausted.

613
00:35:29,124 --> 00:35:30,956
I changed your diaper.

614
00:35:31,091 --> 00:35:34,923
I've got your bottle, your Binky,
and here are your balloons.

615
00:35:35,058 --> 00:35:37,967
There you go. You
like those, right?

616
00:35:38,102 --> 00:35:40,561
All right. A little
bit of me time.

617
00:35:46,471 --> 00:35:47,969
Ah!

618
00:36:13,436 --> 00:36:17,102
Someone put a glitter
bomb in my locker. Ugh.

619
00:36:17,238 --> 00:36:19,176
Teenagers are the worst.

620
00:36:20,243 --> 00:36:23,546
Yeah. Babies are
no picnic either.

621
00:36:28,547 --> 00:36:30,376
Ah!

622
00:36:30,512 --> 00:36:31,584
Junior!

623
00:36:46,004 --> 00:36:48,499
Ah, okay. Okay.

624
00:36:48,634 --> 00:36:51,373
Dua Lipa prosciutto.

625
00:36:57,875 --> 00:37:00,250
Fire in the bowl.

626
00:37:02,920 --> 00:37:04,551
Good night, Ralph.

627
00:37:08,188 --> 00:37:10,188
♪ Taking out the trash
'Cause I'm an awesome dad ♪

628
00:37:10,286 --> 00:37:12,421
♪ And the baby Finally
went to sleep ♪

629
00:37:16,329 --> 00:37:17,492
Hello, Gru.

630
00:37:17,628 --> 00:37:20,567
Hello. Hey! What the...

631
00:37:22,671 --> 00:37:25,606
Oh, hello, Poppy. Did
you say something?

632
00:37:25,742 --> 00:37:28,645
Wha... Uh... my name's
Chet, by the way.

633
00:37:28,780 --> 00:37:30,212
Chet Cunningham.

634
00:37:30,348 --> 00:37:33,811
Gru? What does that even mean?

635
00:37:36,847 --> 00:37:38,547
It means you're bad at lying.

636
00:37:38,682 --> 00:37:40,353
Hey. That's not nice.

637
00:37:40,489 --> 00:37:42,584
Ever hear of
respecting your elders?

638
00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:44,694
I don't respect boomers.

639
00:37:44,830 --> 00:37:46,286
I just mock them.

640
00:37:46,421 --> 00:37:50,296
Ah, ha, ha. Is that, like,
a joke you read on the Web?

641
00:37:50,431 --> 00:37:54,395
Wow. "The Web"? How old are you?

642
00:37:54,530 --> 00:37:57,837
Well, old enough to know that
you are a rotten little...

643
00:37:57,972 --> 00:37:59,139
Huh?

644
00:37:59,274 --> 00:38:01,503
You better watch yourself.

645
00:38:01,638 --> 00:38:03,078
Ooh-hoo. Oof.

646
00:38:03,213 --> 00:38:05,581
You used to be a master villain.

647
00:38:05,717 --> 00:38:09,849
That's not me. I don't
even see a resemblance.

648
00:38:09,985 --> 00:38:15,754
Clearly, you have the wrong guy,
as I sell, mmm, solar panels.

649
00:38:15,889 --> 00:38:18,591
Oh, don't worry. I'm
not gonna expose you.

650
00:38:18,727 --> 00:38:20,589
Because you're gonna
help me pull a heist.

651
00:38:20,725 --> 00:38:22,298
We start planning tomorrow.

652
00:38:22,433 --> 00:38:25,299
You want to pull a heist?

653
00:38:25,434 --> 00:38:26,935
Listen, kid, I'm not going to...

654
00:38:27,071 --> 00:38:28,661
No. You listen, old man.

655
00:38:28,797 --> 00:38:31,306
Ow. I own you.

656
00:38:31,442 --> 00:38:36,110
And I promise, you do
not want to cross me.

657
00:38:36,246 --> 00:38:38,214
Okay. All right.

658
00:38:38,350 --> 00:38:41,113
But tomorrow is not
really good timing.

659
00:38:41,248 --> 00:38:42,446
Bummer for you.

660
00:38:42,582 --> 00:38:44,785
Because this is happening.

661
00:38:44,921 --> 00:38:49,854
Unless you want the whole world
to know exactly who you are...

662
00:38:53,093 --> 00:38:54,760
Gru.

663
00:38:55,628 --> 00:38:58,368
She is terrifying.

664
00:39:13,412 --> 00:39:14,784
Ow! Ooh!

665
00:39:14,919 --> 00:39:16,645
Whoo-hoo-hoo!

666
00:39:16,781 --> 00:39:18,347
Five!

667
00:39:23,952 --> 00:39:25,325
Oh!

668
00:39:27,164 --> 00:39:29,030
Yay!

669
00:39:29,165 --> 00:39:30,592
Aw.

670
00:39:30,728 --> 00:39:31,833
Hey, Jiminy!

671
00:39:31,969 --> 00:39:34,162
No problemo.

672
00:39:46,646 --> 00:39:49,016
Oh, phew.

673
00:39:49,151 --> 00:39:51,146
Oy.

674
00:39:59,561 --> 00:40:01,761
All right, all
right. Settle down.

675
00:40:02,494 --> 00:40:03,898
Settle down!

676
00:40:04,033 --> 00:40:05,635
Thank you.

677
00:40:05,770 --> 00:40:08,528
It's time to get you out for
some real-world training.

678
00:40:08,664 --> 00:40:09,929
Liberty.

679
00:40:10,065 --> 00:40:12,375
And, if you do well out there,

680
00:40:12,511 --> 00:40:15,709
you'll be the AVL's
new secret weapon.

681
00:40:16,342 --> 00:40:17,342
Pomodoro!

682
00:40:18,245 --> 00:40:20,274
Pomodoro!

683
00:40:22,350 --> 00:40:23,420
Ouch.

684
00:40:28,526 --> 00:40:31,494
I'm quite sure I
won't regret this.

685
00:40:32,892 --> 00:40:34,755
No. The painters
canceled. Uh-huh.

686
00:40:34,891 --> 00:40:36,090
True story. Wow.

687
00:40:36,226 --> 00:40:37,666
I don't know what
is the deal with...

688
00:40:37,763 --> 00:40:39,098
Morning, neighbors.

689
00:40:39,233 --> 00:40:40,568
Hey there!

690
00:40:40,703 --> 00:40:43,234
Still waiting on
that invite, Perry.

691
00:40:43,370 --> 00:40:44,666
Ugh. Oh!

692
00:40:44,802 --> 00:40:47,033
No. No, no. Yoo-hoo!

693
00:40:47,168 --> 00:40:48,470
Patsy! Oh, neighbors.

694
00:40:48,605 --> 00:40:49,873
Oh, Patsy.

695
00:40:50,009 --> 00:40:52,612
Hi there. I'm
Perry's wife, Patsy.

696
00:40:52,747 --> 00:40:55,276
Oh! I'm Blanche.
And this is Chet.

697
00:40:55,412 --> 00:40:59,115
Hi. So, I look over
here and I see you...

698
00:40:59,250 --> 00:41:01,984
and I have one of
my brilliant ideas.

699
00:41:02,120 --> 00:41:04,189
Perry needs a fourth
for tennis tomorrow.

700
00:41:04,324 --> 00:41:05,523
Oh, honey.

701
00:41:05,659 --> 00:41:07,255
I don't know.

702
00:41:07,390 --> 00:41:09,830
He doesn't seem like
much of a tennis guy.

703
00:41:09,965 --> 00:41:13,134
Much of a tennis guy? I'm
too much of a tennis guy.

704
00:41:13,269 --> 00:41:14,767
I'm Mr. Tennis.

705
00:41:14,903 --> 00:41:18,235
It's my favorite of
all the sports games.

706
00:41:18,370 --> 00:41:22,945
With the racket and with the
balls. So yellow and fuzzy.

707
00:41:24,139 --> 00:41:25,512
Oh, then we're all set.

708
00:41:25,647 --> 00:41:28,081
See you two at
the club tomorrow.

709
00:41:28,216 --> 00:41:29,418
Toodle-oo!

710
00:41:29,554 --> 00:41:32,346
Okay. Toodle-oo
to you two too.

711
00:41:33,049 --> 00:41:34,848
So, you... you play tennis?

712
00:41:34,984 --> 00:41:37,688
Yes. Yes. I play tennis.

713
00:41:37,824 --> 00:41:40,329
I'm pretty fantastic actually.

714
00:41:40,465 --> 00:41:42,322
Well, at least I
was at summer camp.

715
00:41:42,457 --> 00:41:45,728
Wow. That's great.
Here you go.

716
00:41:45,863 --> 00:41:47,727
Okay, bye.

717
00:41:47,862 --> 00:41:49,264
Have fun!

718
00:41:50,272 --> 00:41:51,431
There you go.

719
00:41:53,241 --> 00:41:54,605
Okay.

720
00:41:54,741 --> 00:41:56,678
Huh?

721
00:42:03,846 --> 00:42:04,986
What the...

722
00:42:21,499 --> 00:42:22,499
Gru.

723
00:42:22,604 --> 00:42:25,473
You can't hide from me, Gru.

724
00:42:25,608 --> 00:42:27,473
Ay! My back is killing me.

725
00:42:27,609 --> 00:42:29,411
How long is this gonna take?

726
00:42:29,546 --> 00:42:31,742
It will take as
long as it takes.

727
00:42:31,877 --> 00:42:35,046
Mark my words, Gru will not win.

728
00:42:35,182 --> 00:42:37,516
This won't be like the
ninth-grade talent show.

729
00:42:37,652 --> 00:42:39,916
Ay, again with this.

730
00:42:40,052 --> 00:42:42,719
Yes, again. It was
a pivotal moment.

731
00:42:42,855 --> 00:42:44,291
Why can't you indulge me?

732
00:42:46,763 --> 00:42:49,522
It was the night
of the big show.

733
00:42:50,567 --> 00:42:52,669
I had practiced for weeks,

734
00:42:52,804 --> 00:42:56,168
perfecting a number that
would blow my classmates away.

735
00:42:56,304 --> 00:42:58,839
♪ Karma, karma Karma,
karma chameleon ♪

736
00:42:58,974 --> 00:43:00,904
I was about to go on when...

737
00:43:01,039 --> 00:43:04,339
What? Wh... Oh! I heard it.

738
00:43:06,179 --> 00:43:10,113
♪ Karma, karma Karma,
karma chameleon ♪

739
00:43:10,249 --> 00:43:14,457
There was that little
jerk doing my big number.

740
00:43:14,593 --> 00:43:16,890
♪ You come and go ♪

741
00:43:17,855 --> 00:43:19,554
He ruined everything.

742
00:43:19,690 --> 00:43:22,758
I couldn't go on after him. I
would have looked like a fool.

743
00:43:22,894 --> 00:43:24,696
Like I was copying him.

744
00:43:24,831 --> 00:43:27,126
Maybe it was just a coincidence.

745
00:43:27,262 --> 00:43:28,930
That was a very popular song.

746
00:43:29,066 --> 00:43:31,239
Oh, no, no, no, no. He knew.

747
00:43:31,374 --> 00:43:32,874
He did it on purpose.

748
00:43:33,009 --> 00:43:36,308
He reveled in
humiliating me. Oh!

749
00:43:36,443 --> 00:43:37,545
What now?

750
00:43:37,680 --> 00:43:39,171
We're low on fuel.

751
00:43:39,307 --> 00:43:41,013
It's always something.

752
00:43:41,149 --> 00:43:44,845
Look, I can never focus
on just being evil.

753
00:43:44,980 --> 00:43:47,184
Okay. Pull over.

754
00:44:16,144 --> 00:44:17,516
Okay, let's see.

755
00:44:17,651 --> 00:44:20,047
Regular unleaded. Oh.

756
00:44:20,182 --> 00:44:22,287
Wow. It is expensive, no?

757
00:44:22,423 --> 00:44:26,260
Okay. Insert card
and remove rapidly.

758
00:44:26,395 --> 00:44:27,763
"Card not read"?

759
00:44:29,257 --> 00:44:30,992
Oh, come on.

760
00:44:31,128 --> 00:44:32,465
Did you pull it out rapidly?

761
00:44:32,601 --> 00:44:34,863
Yes. Yes. Very rapidly.

762
00:44:34,998 --> 00:44:36,533
Come...

763
00:44:42,506 --> 00:44:45,473
Ay, get me a slushy.
It's my cheat day.

764
00:44:46,951 --> 00:44:50,583
Hey, you. Your stupid
machine won't read my card.

765
00:44:50,718 --> 00:44:52,253
Did you remove it rapidly?

766
00:44:52,388 --> 00:44:54,155
Yes.

767
00:44:54,290 --> 00:44:58,220
Well, sometimes it's too rapid.
You should probably try again.

768
00:44:58,356 --> 00:45:00,796
I don't have time for this.

769
00:45:01,463 --> 00:45:03,060
Okay. Whoa!

770
00:45:03,196 --> 00:45:07,297
I'm trying to destroy
my arch nemesis!

771
00:45:07,432 --> 00:45:10,505
Now, give me 900 gallons
on pump four, you idiot.

772
00:45:10,640 --> 00:45:13,068
Whoa! Please, don't hurt me.

773
00:45:13,204 --> 00:45:15,242
Oh, I'm not going to hurt you.

774
00:45:16,840 --> 00:45:18,242
Wha...

775
00:45:25,817 --> 00:45:27,421
Oh! Look at you!

776
00:45:27,556 --> 00:45:29,886
Ha, ha! Much better.

777
00:45:30,022 --> 00:45:32,227
Now, get me a purple slushy!

778
00:45:34,022 --> 00:45:36,323
I'm not paying for that,
just so you know. So there.

779
00:45:36,458 --> 00:45:38,564
I know. I'm so bad.

780
00:45:44,207 --> 00:45:48,040
Hmm. Okay, why don't you guys
pick out a healthy cereal?

781
00:45:48,175 --> 00:45:51,176
This is Lucky's favorite cereal.

782
00:45:52,079 --> 00:45:54,247
You don't think he'll forget me?

783
00:45:54,383 --> 00:45:55,783
Do you?

784
00:45:55,919 --> 00:45:58,852
Oh, sweetheart,
that's impossible.

785
00:45:58,987 --> 00:46:01,589
You play with Lucky
and dress him up.

786
00:46:01,724 --> 00:46:03,555
And you guys have your podcast.

787
00:46:03,690 --> 00:46:08,529
There is no way in this world he
could ever forget his best friend.

788
00:46:08,664 --> 00:46:10,690
Thanks, Mom.

789
00:46:11,764 --> 00:46:12,864
Oh, lookit!

790
00:46:12,999 --> 00:46:15,833
This one has extra marshmallows.

791
00:46:15,969 --> 00:46:17,499
Double-frosted choco clusters.

792
00:46:17,634 --> 00:46:20,003
Yeah. Yeah. Let's
go with those.

793
00:46:20,138 --> 00:46:21,967
All right. What else do we need?

794
00:46:23,578 --> 00:46:25,780
Oh, no.

795
00:46:25,916 --> 00:46:28,741
Nobody see. Nobody
notice. Nobody notice.

796
00:46:32,580 --> 00:46:34,082
What's wrong? Huh?

797
00:46:34,218 --> 00:46:36,823
Oh, nothing. Just, uh... Ooh.

798
00:46:36,959 --> 00:46:39,390
Stretching before
we hit the aisles.

799
00:46:39,525 --> 00:46:42,293
Shopping is the number one
cause of pulled hamstrings.

800
00:46:42,429 --> 00:46:44,130
Huh. You probably
didn't know that.

801
00:46:47,133 --> 00:46:48,470
Okay, all stretched. Let's go.

802
00:46:48,606 --> 00:46:51,102
Quickly. Quick, quick, quick.

803
00:46:51,238 --> 00:46:53,601
Okay. Coast is clear...

804
00:46:56,072 --> 00:46:57,476
Oh.

805
00:46:57,612 --> 00:47:00,010
You.

806
00:47:01,982 --> 00:47:04,979
You did this to me, you fraud.

807
00:47:05,114 --> 00:47:06,114
Come on, girls.

808
00:47:06,216 --> 00:47:07,748
Clean up on aisle nine!

809
00:47:07,883 --> 00:47:10,651
I've always wanted to say
that. Just hide over here.

810
00:47:11,486 --> 00:47:13,419
What does that lady want?

811
00:47:13,554 --> 00:47:15,161
Lady? I didn't see a lady.

812
00:47:17,533 --> 00:47:19,467
Lady!

813
00:47:19,603 --> 00:47:20,962
Come on. Let's go.

814
00:47:21,098 --> 00:47:22,702
Faster! Whoa!

815
00:47:22,838 --> 00:47:24,735
You're no hairdresser.

816
00:47:26,139 --> 00:47:28,575
I'm on to you! Get back here.

817
00:47:28,711 --> 00:47:29,846
I gotta get out of here.

818
00:47:46,693 --> 00:47:48,221
Okay.

819
00:47:55,197 --> 00:47:56,235
Come back here.

820
00:47:57,674 --> 00:47:59,535
Whoa-ho-ho.

821
00:48:02,205 --> 00:48:03,539
Hey! No, no, no, no!

822
00:48:05,147 --> 00:48:08,544
- You can't just...
- Open, open, open!

823
00:48:15,293 --> 00:48:16,655
Whoa!

824
00:48:16,790 --> 00:48:18,191
Let's go!

825
00:48:22,489 --> 00:48:24,728
Stop! Come here, you!

826
00:48:29,201 --> 00:48:32,238
Whew. That was a close one.

827
00:48:32,373 --> 00:48:34,570
Always a fun time when
you go shopping with Mom.

828
00:48:34,705 --> 00:48:37,947
- Yeah! I feel so alive!
- Best shopping trip ever!

829
00:49:10,674 --> 00:49:12,579
Perfecto.

830
00:49:12,714 --> 00:49:13,481
Poppy!

831
00:49:13,617 --> 00:49:16,449
Poppy!

832
00:49:19,582 --> 00:49:21,082
I don't see her, Junior.

833
00:49:21,217 --> 00:49:22,682
Look up, genius.

834
00:49:22,818 --> 00:49:24,818
Huh? You're late.

835
00:49:25,728 --> 00:49:27,529
How do I get up there?

836
00:49:27,665 --> 00:49:29,022
Use the trampoline.

837
00:49:29,157 --> 00:49:30,527
Huh?

838
00:49:35,935 --> 00:49:37,105
Here we go.

839
00:49:50,148 --> 00:49:52,120
Ow, ow, ow, ah, ow!

840
00:50:04,865 --> 00:50:06,065
It is I,

841
00:50:06,201 --> 00:50:10,604
Poppy Prescott, villainess.

842
00:50:10,740 --> 00:50:12,432
Have a seat, Gru.

843
00:50:12,568 --> 00:50:13,801
All right, I'll sit... Ah!

844
00:50:15,646 --> 00:50:17,836
Okay. Why am I here?

845
00:50:17,972 --> 00:50:22,942
Because, like you, I
was born to be bad.

846
00:50:23,077 --> 00:50:27,880
And now, it's time to
discuss our big heist.

847
00:50:28,015 --> 00:50:30,983
Pfft, heist. Please.
You're just a child.

848
00:50:32,995 --> 00:50:35,088
All great villains start young.

849
00:50:35,223 --> 00:50:38,232
Didn't you steal the Crown
Jewels when you were 12?

850
00:50:39,199 --> 00:50:40,969
I was a lot younger than that.

851
00:50:41,104 --> 00:50:43,070
And, no offense,
but you're not me.

852
00:50:43,206 --> 00:50:46,801
Oh, I plan on being a
lot better than you.

853
00:50:47,468 --> 00:50:49,238
Check this out.

854
00:50:49,374 --> 00:50:52,072
Hey, is that my old school?

855
00:50:52,208 --> 00:50:53,208
Bingo.

856
00:50:53,312 --> 00:50:54,782
Which I have expertly modeled

857
00:50:54,918 --> 00:50:57,276
with glue and Popsicle sticks.

858
00:50:57,412 --> 00:51:02,454
And it's where we are going
to steal the school mascot.

859
00:51:03,321 --> 00:51:04,854
You want to steal Lenny?

860
00:51:04,990 --> 00:51:06,292
Exactly.

861
00:51:06,428 --> 00:51:09,221
Lycée Pas Bon has always
been my dream school.

862
00:51:09,357 --> 00:51:12,601
And this heist will look so
great on my villain transcripts.

863
00:51:12,737 --> 00:51:14,761
That is a terrible idea.

864
00:51:14,897 --> 00:51:17,873
Have you ever even
seen a honey badger?

865
00:51:18,008 --> 00:51:20,032
They are vicious
little monsters.

866
00:51:20,167 --> 00:51:24,042
They literally eat bees
and cobras for breakfast.

867
00:51:24,178 --> 00:51:26,210
Honey badger don't care.

868
00:51:26,345 --> 00:51:28,611
No way. No way am I helping you.

869
00:51:28,746 --> 00:51:31,252
Well, that's the
thing with blackmail,

870
00:51:32,252 --> 00:51:34,116
you kinda have no choice.

871
00:52:00,544 --> 00:52:03,114
Ha, ha!

872
00:52:03,249 --> 00:52:05,114
Okay.

873
00:52:06,822 --> 00:52:09,249
Oh. Ah. Uh...

874
00:52:09,384 --> 00:52:10,485
Tim! Tim.

875
00:52:10,620 --> 00:52:12,188
Go, go, go!

876
00:52:16,195 --> 00:52:17,658
Chihuahua.

877
00:52:23,368 --> 00:52:25,641
No!

878
00:52:34,652 --> 00:52:36,848
Suppository!

879
00:52:41,020 --> 00:52:42,020
Give it!

880
00:52:42,154 --> 00:52:43,921
Hey! Police!

881
00:52:44,057 --> 00:52:45,293
No problemo!

882
00:52:53,394 --> 00:52:54,394
Ooh.

883
00:52:54,463 --> 00:52:55,996
Uh, piña colada.

884
00:53:03,174 --> 00:53:04,174
Help!

885
00:53:06,617 --> 00:53:07,375
Hola.

886
00:53:07,511 --> 00:53:09,013
Please. Can you help me?

887
00:53:09,148 --> 00:53:10,148
Oh, sí, sí.

888
00:53:17,525 --> 00:53:20,559
Ah. Hey! All is good. Ciao!

889
00:53:23,700 --> 00:53:26,301
Smudge! Smudge,
come down. Hey!

890
00:53:30,840 --> 00:53:31,840
El gato.

891
00:53:33,206 --> 00:53:35,167
Thank you. Thank you.

892
00:53:36,538 --> 00:53:38,709
Ooh, smooch.

893
00:53:42,048 --> 00:53:43,417
Smoochy.

894
00:53:50,452 --> 00:53:51,559
Help!

895
00:53:51,695 --> 00:53:54,387
Bazooka!

896
00:54:11,178 --> 00:54:12,875
Ah. Eh.

897
00:54:18,854 --> 00:54:19,854
Hey, hey.

898
00:54:25,388 --> 00:54:26,592
Yeah!

899
00:54:38,937 --> 00:54:41,273
There they are. Those
guys crushed my car.

900
00:54:41,408 --> 00:54:42,902
They destroyed the coffee shop.

901
00:54:43,038 --> 00:54:44,411
Yeah! Get outta here!

902
00:54:44,547 --> 00:54:46,173
They're ruining everything.

903
00:54:46,309 --> 00:54:48,743
I'm sick of superheroes.
Yeah! Let's get 'em.

904
00:54:48,879 --> 00:54:51,078
No more superheroes!
Oh, no, no, no!

905
00:54:52,514 --> 00:54:54,152
Get in!

906
00:54:56,550 --> 00:54:58,827
Boo! Yeah, get outta here!

907
00:54:58,962 --> 00:55:00,995
Gentlemen...

908
00:55:01,131 --> 00:55:02,791
our experiment has failed.

909
00:55:02,926 --> 00:55:05,763
You are officially
going to be retired.

910
00:55:05,898 --> 00:55:08,427
Retirement!

911
00:55:08,563 --> 00:55:09,767
Uh, no?

912
00:55:24,922 --> 00:55:26,982
Whoa. There it is.

913
00:55:34,097 --> 00:55:37,124
The castle, the gargoyles.

914
00:55:37,260 --> 00:55:39,192
I can't believe I'm really here.

915
00:55:45,934 --> 00:55:47,470
Okay.

916
00:55:50,909 --> 00:55:53,709
Okay. Let's get
this over with.

917
00:55:53,844 --> 00:55:55,810
Ron, hand me my gear. Voilà.

918
00:55:55,946 --> 00:55:58,110
Keep a close eye on him. Okay.

919
00:55:58,245 --> 00:55:59,852
- If you need anything...
- Uh-huh.

920
00:55:59,987 --> 00:56:02,280
I brought formula, extra
diapers, his favorite Binky...

921
00:56:02,416 --> 00:56:05,024
Come on. Let's go. Let's go.

922
00:56:12,634 --> 00:56:15,899
And now, we cut through
the glass with my...

923
00:56:16,664 --> 00:56:17,933
diapers?

924
00:56:18,068 --> 00:56:20,436
What? You've got to
be kidding with me.

925
00:56:21,672 --> 00:56:23,137
Muerte a la piñata!

926
00:56:23,273 --> 00:56:26,809
Hey, guys. Guys. Guys? Guys!

927
00:56:26,945 --> 00:56:29,842
Guys, where is the
other bag with my gear?

928
00:56:29,978 --> 00:56:31,349
Balloon.

929
00:56:31,484 --> 00:56:32,586
Ah.

930
00:56:33,450 --> 00:56:34,519
Oops.

931
00:56:36,884 --> 00:56:38,717
What? How...

932
00:56:40,688 --> 00:56:44,299
All right. All right. Let's
see what I got in here. Uh...

933
00:56:44,435 --> 00:56:47,128
Come on. Come on,
come on, come on. Aha!

934
00:56:57,741 --> 00:57:00,339
Easy-peasy.

935
00:57:12,554 --> 00:57:13,828
Huh?

936
00:57:18,201 --> 00:57:20,296
That's Mr. Friendly.

937
00:57:20,432 --> 00:57:22,268
Stupid kids.

938
00:57:24,700 --> 00:57:26,369
No, no, no!

939
00:57:32,841 --> 00:57:33,979
Oh, I hate my job.

940
00:57:34,115 --> 00:57:35,277
Whew.

941
00:57:37,020 --> 00:57:38,586
Stupid kids.

942
00:57:43,821 --> 00:57:45,417
Ha-ha-ha.

943
00:57:50,600 --> 00:57:53,634
That's Dr. Destructo.
He was just a kid.

944
00:57:53,769 --> 00:57:56,166
And there is Killer
Driller's original helmet.

945
00:57:56,302 --> 00:57:57,433
Come on!

946
00:57:57,568 --> 00:57:58,804
Stay focused.

947
00:58:07,879 --> 00:58:09,617
Diaper.

948
00:58:23,491 --> 00:58:27,166
I need something like...
Something that I can...

949
00:58:27,301 --> 00:58:28,495
How about this?

950
00:58:28,631 --> 00:58:30,132
Nice.

951
00:58:33,341 --> 00:58:34,510
Yes!

952
00:58:38,247 --> 00:58:40,146
We're in.

953
00:58:40,282 --> 00:58:42,807
Wait. No, no, no.

954
00:58:42,943 --> 00:58:43,943
Baby powder!

955
00:58:44,010 --> 00:58:45,015
Ah, sí, sí.

956
00:58:50,554 --> 00:58:52,022
Whoa!

957
00:58:52,157 --> 00:58:54,661
You know, the most
important part of a heist

958
00:58:54,797 --> 00:58:58,530
is being constantly aware
of potential danger.

959
00:58:58,666 --> 00:59:00,569
Tiramisu!

960
00:59:02,633 --> 00:59:04,336
No. Junior!

961
00:59:04,472 --> 00:59:05,739
Junior, come back here.

962
00:59:08,302 --> 00:59:10,574
So, what's your plan now?

963
00:59:10,710 --> 00:59:12,840
I am dealing with it.

964
00:59:16,144 --> 00:59:17,743
Don't touch anything. No.

965
00:59:17,879 --> 00:59:20,556
No, no, no!

966
00:59:22,559 --> 00:59:25,618
Good job, Junior. Way to go.

967
00:59:29,464 --> 00:59:31,032
Aw, he's having fun.

968
00:59:31,168 --> 00:59:32,764
Ugh, too much fun.

969
00:59:36,165 --> 00:59:37,669
Please, Junior.

970
00:59:37,805 --> 00:59:40,037
Daddy needs to steal
a honey badger.

971
00:59:43,344 --> 00:59:44,943
Okay.

972
00:59:46,044 --> 00:59:48,309
I know they keep
Lenny here at night.

973
00:59:49,209 --> 00:59:51,080
And, if memory serves,

974
00:59:51,216 --> 00:59:54,549
there is a hidden switch
around here somewhere.

975
00:59:54,684 --> 00:59:56,086
Ah! Ha-ha.

976
00:59:57,460 --> 00:59:58,957
Yes!

977
00:59:59,723 --> 01:00:01,861
Ooh.

978
01:00:11,034 --> 01:00:12,707
I'll hit him with this.

979
01:00:12,843 --> 01:00:15,470
Once he's knocked out,
we'll open the cage.

980
01:00:15,606 --> 01:00:18,306
That fuzzy demon will sleep
like a baby the whole...

981
01:00:23,821 --> 01:00:26,820
Okay. He's still asleep.

982
01:00:31,052 --> 01:00:32,991
Mamma mia!

983
01:00:37,234 --> 01:00:38,832
I tranked myself.

984
01:00:46,067 --> 01:00:47,533
Hey! Hey!

985
01:00:49,942 --> 01:00:51,713
Gru, what do we do?

986
01:00:52,477 --> 01:00:53,814
No!

987
01:00:57,785 --> 01:01:00,186
Oh, no! I've ruined our heist.

988
01:01:02,555 --> 01:01:05,089
What? Who dares?

989
01:01:10,826 --> 01:01:12,426
Intruders!

990
01:01:14,929 --> 01:01:16,936
Intruders!

991
01:01:28,778 --> 01:01:30,246
Wake up!

992
01:01:31,351 --> 01:01:32,351
No!

993
01:01:38,326 --> 01:01:39,326
What?

994
01:01:42,329 --> 01:01:43,391
Hmm.

995
01:01:46,465 --> 01:01:47,997
Aw.

996
01:01:48,132 --> 01:01:50,500
Aw.

997
01:01:50,635 --> 01:01:51,702
No. Nope.

998
01:01:54,334 --> 01:01:56,745
Come on. We have to go.

999
01:02:03,186 --> 01:02:04,277
Intruders!

1000
01:02:04,413 --> 01:02:06,753
You messed with the
wrong principal.

1001
01:02:06,888 --> 01:02:09,549
Here we go. Come on. Come on.

1002
01:02:15,389 --> 01:02:17,064
Go, go, go! Go, go, go.

1003
01:02:20,995 --> 01:02:24,465
Come on! Come on! Ooh, you
won't get away with this.

1004
01:02:27,572 --> 01:02:28,572
Ah!

1005
01:02:47,360 --> 01:02:49,622
Prepare to feel the
wrath of Übelschlecht!

1006
01:02:53,799 --> 01:02:55,170
Diaper rash cream.

1007
01:02:55,305 --> 01:02:56,568
Oh, no. Oh, no!

1008
01:02:56,704 --> 01:02:58,296
Stop, stop, stop!

1009
01:03:00,540 --> 01:03:01,933
Oh, dear.

1010
01:03:02,068 --> 01:03:03,339
Oof!

1011
01:03:04,480 --> 01:03:05,840
Get back here, you.

1012
01:03:05,975 --> 01:03:08,311
I want my Lenny!

1013
01:03:12,116 --> 01:03:14,287
How are we getting out of here?

1014
01:03:14,422 --> 01:03:15,989
Follow me.

1015
01:03:16,721 --> 01:03:17,721
Get in!

1016
01:03:20,288 --> 01:03:22,163
Come on, come on, come on.

1017
01:03:24,796 --> 01:03:26,329
Mr. Friendly!

1018
01:03:27,501 --> 01:03:29,134
Whoa!

1019
01:03:49,392 --> 01:03:55,061
I have to say, that was without a
doubt the coolest night of my life.

1020
01:03:55,196 --> 01:03:57,623
I can't believe we
actually pulled that off.

1021
01:03:57,759 --> 01:04:02,227
Not gonna lie, that
was pretty fun.

1022
01:04:04,803 --> 01:04:05,968
Thanks, Ron.

1023
01:04:06,103 --> 01:04:07,508
Phew.

1024
01:04:07,644 --> 01:04:11,374
And thank you for everything.

1025
01:04:12,276 --> 01:04:14,607
Oh, and hey. Don't worry.

1026
01:04:14,743 --> 01:04:17,811
Your secret is safe
with me, partner.

1027
01:04:17,947 --> 01:04:19,286
Thanks.

1028
01:04:19,422 --> 01:04:20,647
Good night.

1029
01:04:23,290 --> 01:04:26,353
Your dada did pretty
good, huh, Junior?

1030
01:04:32,635 --> 01:04:34,529
Sí, sí, sí. Go, go.

1031
01:04:35,471 --> 01:04:37,230
Hello, Maxime.

1032
01:04:37,366 --> 01:04:39,867
How's my favorite student?

1033
01:04:40,003 --> 01:04:43,677
You know, I think you and I might
be looking for the same person.

1034
01:04:43,812 --> 01:04:46,915
And I know exactly where he is.

1035
01:04:55,023 --> 01:04:57,350
Thank you, Principal
Übelschlecht.

1036
01:04:57,485 --> 01:04:58,756
We got him.

1037
01:04:58,892 --> 01:05:01,793
Valentina, to Mayflower.

1038
01:05:01,929 --> 01:05:04,229
With pleasure.

1039
01:05:08,834 --> 01:05:10,898
Ah, here we go.

1040
01:05:12,366 --> 01:05:13,875
Okay. Yeah. Yeah.

1041
01:05:14,011 --> 01:05:15,907
It's all coming back to me.

1042
01:05:18,142 --> 01:05:19,537
Oops.

1043
01:05:19,673 --> 01:05:22,379
Okay. See you later.

1044
01:05:23,214 --> 01:05:24,584
Say, "Bye, Mommy and Daddy."

1045
01:05:24,719 --> 01:05:25,749
Have fun at the club!

1046
01:05:25,885 --> 01:05:27,818
Make good choices.

1047
01:05:27,953 --> 01:05:29,982
Bye, guys. Goodbye!

1048
01:05:30,117 --> 01:05:31,315
Bye!

1049
01:05:31,451 --> 01:05:32,723
Hey, Cunninghams.

1050
01:05:32,858 --> 01:05:34,924
Um, hey, Poppy.

1051
01:05:35,059 --> 01:05:38,492
I heard our parents are having a
playdate, which is adorable, by the way,

1052
01:05:38,628 --> 01:05:41,162
and I thought you
might wanna hang out.

1053
01:05:41,298 --> 01:05:43,299
Oh, yeah. Sure. Come on in.

1054
01:05:43,435 --> 01:05:46,238
Let's get this party
started, people.

1055
01:05:46,905 --> 01:05:48,434
I like her.

1056
01:05:48,569 --> 01:05:50,905
Yeah. Most people do.

1057
01:05:51,040 --> 01:05:52,639
Sweet.

1058
01:05:52,774 --> 01:05:55,445
So, have you guys ever
seen a honey badger?

1059
01:06:01,949 --> 01:06:04,957
Whoa, okay, these guys
aren't messing around.

1060
01:06:05,093 --> 01:06:07,490
There are my favorite
new neighbors.

1061
01:06:08,298 --> 01:06:09,298
Hi.

1062
01:06:09,393 --> 01:06:11,623
I'm loving this whole vibe.

1063
01:06:11,759 --> 01:06:14,435
You two look like
a couple of pros.

1064
01:06:15,795 --> 01:06:17,996
Yeah, but we're not.

1065
01:06:18,132 --> 01:06:20,665
Perry and the boys are waiting
for y'all on the court,

1066
01:06:20,800 --> 01:06:23,476
and we are hitting
the clubhouse.

1067
01:06:23,612 --> 01:06:26,137
And you're telling me where
you got that to-die-for outfit.

1068
01:06:30,278 --> 01:06:31,778
Ah! Ugh.

1069
01:06:32,621 --> 01:06:34,047
Over here, Chet.

1070
01:06:34,182 --> 01:06:35,287
Hello.

1071
01:06:36,019 --> 01:06:37,652
Okay.

1072
01:06:38,353 --> 01:06:39,353
Skip, Chip, Chet.

1073
01:06:39,486 --> 01:06:40,494
Chet, Skip, Chip.

1074
01:06:40,630 --> 01:06:41,630
Hey there, fellas.

1075
01:06:41,755 --> 01:06:43,292
Hello. How are
you doing, Chet?

1076
01:06:43,427 --> 01:06:45,760
Okay.

1077
01:06:45,895 --> 01:06:48,762
Chet here is gonna show
us fellas how it's done.

1078
01:06:49,637 --> 01:06:50,833
Right?

1079
01:06:50,969 --> 01:06:53,600
Um.

1080
01:06:53,736 --> 01:06:56,937
I'm gonna smoke this guy.

1081
01:06:57,073 --> 01:06:58,508
Okay.

1082
01:07:05,118 --> 01:07:07,715
Huh?

1083
01:07:08,681 --> 01:07:10,718
What the...

1084
01:07:16,359 --> 01:07:18,858
Okay, let's do this.

1085
01:07:23,764 --> 01:07:25,704
Huh? You've gotta be kidding.

1086
01:07:27,709 --> 01:07:29,671
Okay, okay.

1087
01:07:30,172 --> 01:07:31,172
Better?

1088
01:07:37,047 --> 01:07:38,275
What?

1089
01:07:39,855 --> 01:07:40,952
That doesn't count.

1090
01:07:41,087 --> 01:07:42,252
And...

1091
01:07:42,387 --> 01:07:45,090
What? You can't just j... Hey!

1092
01:07:45,226 --> 01:07:47,722
This is ridiculous!

1093
01:07:53,199 --> 01:07:55,697
Burrito.

1094
01:08:02,504 --> 01:08:03,902
Thanks, Ron.

1095
01:08:04,038 --> 01:08:06,207
Hey, no! Oh, no.

1096
01:08:07,784 --> 01:08:09,311
Come and get it.

1097
01:08:09,446 --> 01:08:11,481
Aw, he's so cute. Whoa!

1098
01:08:11,617 --> 01:08:15,116
This is the weirdest dog ever.

1099
01:08:15,251 --> 01:08:16,454
I'll get it.

1100
01:08:26,092 --> 01:08:30,095
Well, hello, little
one. Is your daddy home?

1101
01:08:30,230 --> 01:08:33,898
Sorry. I'm not "stupposed"
to talk to strangers.

1102
01:08:34,033 --> 01:08:36,667
Oh, I'm not a stranger.

1103
01:08:36,803 --> 01:08:39,604
Well, you look strange to me.

1104
01:08:39,740 --> 01:08:42,110
Who is it?

1105
01:08:42,246 --> 01:08:43,974
I don't know.

1106
01:08:44,110 --> 01:08:47,953
But she's old and
smells like pickles.

1107
01:08:51,619 --> 01:08:53,689
Okay, I'm coming.

1108
01:08:57,293 --> 01:08:58,494
Oh, no. Oh.

1109
01:08:58,629 --> 01:09:00,828
I'll be right back.

1110
01:09:03,497 --> 01:09:04,363
Can I help you?

1111
01:09:04,498 --> 01:09:05,973
Well, I hope so.

1112
01:09:06,109 --> 01:09:08,440
I'm an old friend of Gru's.

1113
01:09:09,308 --> 01:09:11,779
Well, he's not here, so...

1114
01:09:11,914 --> 01:09:14,182
Oh, that's all right.

1115
01:09:15,146 --> 01:09:16,580
I'll wait.

1116
01:09:19,947 --> 01:09:22,982
What? No.

1117
01:09:23,117 --> 01:09:25,688
Whenever you're ready, Perry.

1118
01:09:27,621 --> 01:09:28,658
Hmm?

1119
01:09:35,661 --> 01:09:36,729
Needless to say,

1120
01:09:36,864 --> 01:09:38,565
Perry and I are
no longer welcome

1121
01:09:38,700 --> 01:09:41,171
on the island of Oahu.

1122
01:09:41,307 --> 01:09:43,637
True story.

1123
01:09:43,773 --> 01:09:45,379
Honey! Oh, thank goodness.

1124
01:09:45,514 --> 01:09:47,875
It's the children.
We have to go now.

1125
01:09:50,544 --> 01:09:52,019
Thanks. Bye.

1126
01:09:52,154 --> 01:09:54,150
Our cover's blown! What?

1127
01:09:54,286 --> 01:09:56,184
Call Silas! Oh, no.

1128
01:10:20,479 --> 01:10:24,813
♪ Happy birthday to you ♪

1129
01:10:29,559 --> 01:10:30,648
Ah.

1130
01:10:32,226 --> 01:10:33,751
Gru's been compromised.

1131
01:10:33,887 --> 01:10:35,720
This is an emergency, people.

1132
01:10:35,856 --> 01:10:38,030
Retirement is officially over.

1133
01:10:38,166 --> 01:10:40,532
Assemble the Mega Minions.

1134
01:10:48,437 --> 01:10:49,743
Oh!

1135
01:10:49,879 --> 01:10:52,577
Pomodoro!

1136
01:10:53,850 --> 01:10:55,206
Mmm.

1137
01:10:58,788 --> 01:11:00,444
Ah! Pomodoro!

1138
01:11:13,099 --> 01:11:14,968
Hey.

1139
01:11:15,104 --> 01:11:17,371
Busy bee.

1140
01:11:18,333 --> 01:11:19,466
Aw.

1141
01:11:21,007 --> 01:11:22,466
Pomodoro!

1142
01:11:26,716 --> 01:11:27,912
Yeehaw.

1143
01:11:29,884 --> 01:11:31,044
Pomodoro!

1144
01:11:33,384 --> 01:11:36,120
Pomodoro! Yeehaw!

1145
01:11:40,393 --> 01:11:41,492
Huh?

1146
01:11:41,627 --> 01:11:44,591
Whoa! Ha-ha! Yeah!

1147
01:11:54,403 --> 01:11:55,437
So...

1148
01:11:55,573 --> 01:11:58,174
your father has been naughty.

1149
01:11:58,309 --> 01:12:00,613
Very naughty.

1150
01:12:00,748 --> 01:12:04,816
He took something of mine
that I desperately want back.

1151
01:12:05,845 --> 01:12:07,454
Ah! Ha!

1152
01:12:09,422 --> 01:12:11,216
Principal Übelschlecht?

1153
01:12:12,128 --> 01:12:15,325
Ooh! I know you took my Lenny.

1154
01:12:15,461 --> 01:12:17,022
Now hand him over. Ah! Ow!

1155
01:12:17,158 --> 01:12:19,923
That's actually a
very funny story.

1156
01:12:20,059 --> 01:12:21,102
Zip it.

1157
01:12:21,237 --> 01:12:22,834
I don't wanna hear your excuses.

1158
01:12:22,969 --> 01:12:25,197
I'm here to teach you a
lesson. Let's go, tough guy.

1159
01:12:25,332 --> 01:12:28,599
Okay. Okay. I'm not going
to fight an old lady.

1160
01:12:28,734 --> 01:12:30,435
Oh, yeah?

1161
01:12:30,571 --> 01:12:33,439
Well, I'm gonna give you a
whupping for the history books.

1162
01:12:33,575 --> 01:12:34,575
Whoa! Whoa!

1163
01:12:37,182 --> 01:12:38,782
Take that.

1164
01:12:42,957 --> 01:12:44,755
Yeah! Go!

1165
01:12:44,890 --> 01:12:47,323
Girls, look out! Over here!

1166
01:12:47,458 --> 01:12:49,254
Everyone, get down!

1167
01:12:50,089 --> 01:12:52,598
Hey, back off, lady!

1168
01:12:54,696 --> 01:12:55,898
Ow!

1169
01:13:03,736 --> 01:13:04,836
Stop it!

1170
01:13:04,971 --> 01:13:06,571
Let him go!

1171
01:13:06,706 --> 01:13:07,745
Take that!

1172
01:13:16,025 --> 01:13:19,583
Now we have to get in
there and find that baby.

1173
01:13:19,719 --> 01:13:20,857
What?

1174
01:13:24,396 --> 01:13:25,993
Oh, jackpot, huh?

1175
01:13:26,128 --> 01:13:28,829
Ay, Maxime. This is too easy.

1176
01:13:28,964 --> 01:13:31,531
Come here, little bébé.

1177
01:13:31,666 --> 01:13:33,031
Come to Maxime.

1178
01:13:33,167 --> 01:13:35,109
Yes. Coochy, coochy...

1179
01:13:35,245 --> 01:13:37,206
Oh! Ay, Maxime.

1180
01:13:37,342 --> 01:13:38,506
You little...

1181
01:13:38,642 --> 01:13:41,240
You are in big trouble.

1182
01:13:42,379 --> 01:13:43,418
Gotcha!

1183
01:13:44,811 --> 01:13:47,147
Hi-yah!

1184
01:13:53,524 --> 01:13:55,293
Whew.

1185
01:13:55,429 --> 01:13:56,722
Wait. Where's the baby?

1186
01:13:56,857 --> 01:13:58,559
Where's the baby?

1187
01:13:58,694 --> 01:14:00,296
Junior?

1188
01:14:04,468 --> 01:14:05,499
Lucy!

1189
01:14:05,635 --> 01:14:06,806
Go after the baby.

1190
01:14:09,736 --> 01:14:10,736
Maxime.

1191
01:14:10,805 --> 01:14:12,573
Say au revoir, Gru.

1192
01:14:12,709 --> 01:14:13,974
Oh, and don't worry.

1193
01:14:14,110 --> 01:14:17,111
He will be very happy
with his new daddy.

1194
01:14:17,246 --> 01:14:20,644
Right? Look at him. Oh,
he loves his new daddy.

1195
01:14:20,780 --> 01:14:22,152
Junior!

1196
01:14:24,222 --> 01:14:25,955
No!

1197
01:14:30,031 --> 01:14:31,257
Get in.

1198
01:14:32,125 --> 01:14:33,963
We've got a baby to save.

1199
01:14:41,937 --> 01:14:43,675
We got him!

1200
01:14:43,811 --> 01:14:47,280
Oh, ho. Who is ready to
become a little roach?

1201
01:14:47,415 --> 01:14:49,380
Let go!

1202
01:14:49,516 --> 01:14:51,381
Those are very sensitive. Ah!

1203
01:14:51,516 --> 01:14:52,852
You squirmy little...

1204
01:14:52,987 --> 01:14:53,987
Oh!

1205
01:14:54,982 --> 01:14:57,016
Oh! Are you kidding me?

1206
01:14:57,151 --> 01:14:59,552
You got pee-pee
all over my ship.

1207
01:15:01,656 --> 01:15:02,656
Valentina!

1208
01:15:02,760 --> 01:15:04,964
Bring me the Roachification Ray!

1209
01:15:08,301 --> 01:15:09,636
There they are.

1210
01:15:11,766 --> 01:15:13,233
I'm on it.

1211
01:15:13,933 --> 01:15:15,576
Here we go.

1212
01:15:22,343 --> 01:15:24,046
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

1213
01:15:28,453 --> 01:15:30,016
Mmm.

1214
01:15:30,151 --> 01:15:32,356
What's that? Oh!

1215
01:15:32,491 --> 01:15:34,653
Uh. Hello.

1216
01:15:34,788 --> 01:15:36,491
Ugh. Gru!

1217
01:15:36,626 --> 01:15:38,192
Get me closer!

1218
01:15:41,169 --> 01:15:42,462
Almost there.

1219
01:15:43,997 --> 01:15:45,004
Take them out!

1220
01:15:57,220 --> 01:15:59,180
You're doing great.

1221
01:16:04,722 --> 01:16:06,121
Go get 'em, partner.

1222
01:16:23,071 --> 01:16:25,272
Ay! I can't see!

1223
01:16:41,030 --> 01:16:42,223
Junior!

1224
01:16:43,192 --> 01:16:45,362
Don't worry, Gru.

1225
01:16:45,498 --> 01:16:47,100
The baby is fine.

1226
01:16:47,236 --> 01:16:48,903
See for yourself.

1227
01:16:51,834 --> 01:16:53,900
Oh, Junior.

1228
01:16:54,035 --> 01:16:55,573
And now he belongs to me.

1229
01:16:55,708 --> 01:16:58,305
Isn't that right, Maxime Jr?

1230
01:16:59,382 --> 01:17:01,279
Together we will wreak havoc,

1231
01:17:01,414 --> 01:17:02,515
cause mayhem,

1232
01:17:02,650 --> 01:17:04,776
and have so much
fun doing it, huh?

1233
01:17:06,488 --> 01:17:09,023
And best of all, he hates you!

1234
01:17:09,158 --> 01:17:10,354
He really does.

1235
01:17:10,490 --> 01:17:12,424
Let my son go!

1236
01:17:12,559 --> 01:17:14,355
No, I don't think so.

1237
01:17:14,490 --> 01:17:17,327
The fun is just
about to start, huh?

1238
01:17:26,435 --> 01:17:29,976
Oh! Look at what a coward
your old daddy is, huh?

1239
01:17:57,473 --> 01:17:59,173
You crossed the line, Maxime.

1240
01:17:59,308 --> 01:18:00,898
Now, give me my son.

1241
01:18:01,034 --> 01:18:02,175
I told you.

1242
01:18:02,311 --> 01:18:04,143
He is my son now.

1243
01:18:15,148 --> 01:18:17,047
Watch your step, Gru.

1244
01:18:17,183 --> 01:18:18,418
It's a doozy!

1245
01:18:18,553 --> 01:18:21,421
Too bad you can't fly, huh?

1246
01:18:28,469 --> 01:18:30,001
Let go! Ow! Ugh!

1247
01:18:38,544 --> 01:18:40,011
Oh!

1248
01:18:41,712 --> 01:18:43,374
This ends now!

1249
01:18:43,509 --> 01:18:46,512
Say goodbye to Daddy.

1250
01:18:51,394 --> 01:18:53,255
It's okay, Junior.

1251
01:18:54,021 --> 01:18:55,389
Dada loves you.

1252
01:19:15,582 --> 01:19:17,581
Oh!

1253
01:19:20,521 --> 01:19:21,521
Get back here.

1254
01:19:21,586 --> 01:19:22,618
Bad baby.

1255
01:19:22,753 --> 01:19:24,116
Ow, ow, ow! Ow!

1256
01:19:24,251 --> 01:19:25,884
Get off me, you demon.

1257
01:19:26,020 --> 01:19:29,192
You're going to
feel the wrath of...

1258
01:19:39,937 --> 01:19:41,534
Whoa.

1259
01:19:42,235 --> 01:19:44,878
Ow! Oh.

1260
01:19:52,014 --> 01:19:54,453
See? Not a scratch.

1261
01:19:54,589 --> 01:19:56,089
Huh? What?

1262
01:19:56,225 --> 01:19:58,818
Salami!

1263
01:20:00,592 --> 01:20:03,028
Pastrami!

1264
01:20:04,895 --> 01:20:06,465
No, no, no, no, no.

1265
01:20:09,801 --> 01:20:11,867
What? Prosciutto!

1266
01:20:12,003 --> 01:20:13,973
Ew! Ew! Ew! Gross!

1267
01:20:17,469 --> 01:20:20,045
Ha! Nice try. When I...

1268
01:20:23,280 --> 01:20:26,018
Antipasti.

1269
01:20:28,851 --> 01:20:30,154
Ho, ho!

1270
01:20:32,889 --> 01:20:33,889
Gru. Gru!

1271
01:20:33,925 --> 01:20:35,152
- Yeah, yeah!
- Junior!

1272
01:20:35,287 --> 01:20:36,754
Woo!

1273
01:20:39,762 --> 01:20:40,997
Yes!

1274
01:20:41,132 --> 01:20:42,407
- Yippee!
- Holy cow!

1275
01:20:42,431 --> 01:20:44,171
You guys okay?
That was insane!

1276
01:20:49,168 --> 01:20:50,207
Dada.

1277
01:20:53,479 --> 01:20:54,479
Mmm.

1278
01:20:54,579 --> 01:20:56,339
Aw!

1279
01:20:56,475 --> 01:20:59,277
- Oh, my boys.
- Dada.

1280
01:20:59,413 --> 01:21:01,020
You know something?

1281
01:21:01,155 --> 01:21:05,985
Today has been a real
roller coaster of emotion.

1282
01:21:09,463 --> 01:21:10,859
Uh, Gru?

1283
01:21:10,995 --> 01:21:12,867
Can we go back home now?

1284
01:21:17,969 --> 01:21:19,899
All right. There you go.

1285
01:21:20,035 --> 01:21:21,905
Yay.

1286
01:21:22,041 --> 01:21:23,537
Thanks, Dr. Nefario.

1287
01:21:24,512 --> 01:21:25,512
Good as new.

1288
01:21:25,580 --> 01:21:26,941
No job too small,

1289
01:21:27,076 --> 01:21:29,180
or too mad.

1290
01:21:29,846 --> 01:21:30,909
Bye, then.

1291
01:21:31,044 --> 01:21:32,117
Bye.

1292
01:21:40,189 --> 01:21:42,854
Hey. You okay, sweetie?

1293
01:21:42,989 --> 01:21:46,857
Agnes, someone's
here to see you!

1294
01:21:54,675 --> 01:21:56,603
Lucky?

1295
01:22:00,877 --> 01:22:01,949
Lucky!

1296
01:22:05,349 --> 01:22:07,552
Did you practice your tricks?

1297
01:22:07,687 --> 01:22:09,583
Okay. Play dead.

1298
01:22:14,923 --> 01:22:16,159
Yay!

1299
01:22:16,295 --> 01:22:19,930
Ah, that was disturbing.
Yeah, little bit.

1300
01:22:20,065 --> 01:22:21,892
Lucky.

1301
01:22:23,599 --> 01:22:26,000
Hey, I'll, uh...
I'll be back soon.

1302
01:22:26,135 --> 01:22:27,669
Oh, okay.

1303
01:22:27,804 --> 01:22:30,072
There's something I need
to take care of. Yeah.

1304
01:22:30,208 --> 01:22:32,177
See you later, buddy.

1305
01:22:32,778 --> 01:22:33,778
Love you, honey.

1306
01:22:40,613 --> 01:22:43,790
Oh, how you doing, Maxime?

1307
01:22:43,925 --> 01:22:46,251
Ugh, what are you
doing here, Gru?

1308
01:22:46,386 --> 01:22:47,892
You came to gloat? No?

1309
01:22:48,027 --> 01:22:49,591
Gloat? No, no, no, no. I just...

1310
01:22:49,726 --> 01:22:52,427
I wanted to get
something off my chest.

1311
01:22:52,562 --> 01:22:55,761
And it concerns the
ninth-grade talent show.

1312
01:22:56,735 --> 01:22:57,763
Well,

1313
01:22:58,473 --> 01:22:59,501
actually,

1314
01:23:00,401 --> 01:23:02,838
I did steal your song.

1315
01:23:02,973 --> 01:23:04,902
What? I knew it!

1316
01:23:05,037 --> 01:23:07,874
I knew there was no
coincidence. You little liar!

1317
01:23:09,748 --> 01:23:10,748
Well?

1318
01:23:10,849 --> 01:23:12,183
Well, what?

1319
01:23:12,318 --> 01:23:13,878
Well, where's my
apology? Apolo...

1320
01:23:13,915 --> 01:23:16,951
What are you talking
about? I just apologized.

1321
01:23:17,086 --> 01:23:18,316
Oh, no, no, no.

1322
01:23:18,452 --> 01:23:20,286
No, that was no apology.

1323
01:23:20,422 --> 01:23:22,359
You just wanted to rub it in.

1324
01:23:22,495 --> 01:23:25,226
I can't believe you
stole my song! Hey!

1325
01:23:25,362 --> 01:23:29,799
I only did that to get back at you for
pantsing me at the homecoming dance.

1326
01:23:29,934 --> 01:23:33,137
Besides, you could've
gone on after me.

1327
01:23:33,273 --> 01:23:36,138
It is not my fault
that you were afraid.

1328
01:23:36,273 --> 01:23:39,104
Afraid because I killed it!

1329
01:23:39,240 --> 01:23:40,940
Afraid? Ha!

1330
01:23:41,076 --> 01:23:44,818
I could outsing you any day of
the week and all day Sunday.

1331
01:23:44,954 --> 01:23:47,454
I'd like to see that.

1332
01:23:47,590 --> 01:23:49,556
Anytime, anyplace.

1333
01:23:49,692 --> 01:23:51,783
