1
00:00:49,342 --> 00:00:51,252
Hi. I'm Dory.

2
00:00:52,387 --> 00:00:56,097
I suffer from short-term remembory loss.

3
00:00:56,224 --> 00:00:58,714
Yes!
That's exactly what you say!

4
00:00:59,644 --> 00:01:02,534
Ok, Ok. We'll pretend 
to be the other kids now.

5
00:01:05,282 --> 00:01:06,992
Hi, Dory!
Ahoy there!

6
00:01:08,093 --> 00:01:09,753
Do you want to play hide-and-seek?

7
00:01:09,871 --> 00:01:11,661
Ok. I love. Ok.

8
00:01:11,848 --> 00:01:13,928
We'll hide and you count and come find us.

9
00:01:13,992 --> 00:01:15,002
Ok, Daddy.

10
00:01:15,026 --> 00:01:16,700
No, no. Not Daddy.

11
00:01:16,701 --> 00:01:19,513
I'm the nice fish who wants
to be your friend.

12
00:01:19,738 --> 00:01:20,968
Ok?
Ok, Daddy.

13
00:01:20,992 --> 00:01:22,895
No.
I'm hiding.

14
00:01:23,320 --> 00:01:24,796
Now count to ten.

15
00:01:25,336 --> 00:01:28,006
One, two, three,

16
00:01:30,023 --> 00:01:31,063
four.

17
00:01:33,094 --> 00:01:35,884
I like sand. Sand is squishy.

18
00:01:37,506 --> 00:01:39,416
Mommy, can I go play with them?

19
00:01:39,484 --> 00:01:41,664
Dory. Dory. Dory.
Dory. Dory. Kelpcake.

20
00:01:41,686 --> 00:01:43,296
Dory honey.
Undertow, sweetie.

21
00:01:44,463 --> 00:01:47,213
Remember honey, we have
to stay away from the undertow.

22
00:01:47,275 --> 00:01:49,635
Ok, sweetheart,
what about that rhyme we learned?

23
00:01:50,211 --> 00:01:52,551
♪ We see the undertow and we say... ♪

24
00:01:52,630 --> 00:01:53,630
♪ Let's go. ♪

25
00:01:54,115 --> 00:01:55,285
No. No.

26
00:01:55,610 --> 00:01:58,995
It's, Heck no. Ok?
Let's try it again.

27
00:01:59,070 --> 00:02:01,780
♪ We see the undertow and we say... ♪

28
00:02:01,848 --> 00:02:03,628
♪ There's the undertow! ♪

00:02:06,886 --> 00:02:10,886
♪ Hey, you found the undertow ♪
♪ And we see the undertow ♪

31
00:02:13,718 --> 00:02:16,048
Did I forget again?
No, no. No.

32
00:02:16,137 --> 00:02:18,357
No, sweetie. Don't worry about it.
No biggie, kelpcake.

33
00:02:19,098 --> 00:02:21,352
What if I forget you?

34
00:02:22,677 --> 00:02:24,902
Would you ever forget me?

35
00:02:25,188 --> 00:02:26,708
Oh, kelpcake, no.

36
00:02:26,773 --> 00:02:28,961
We will never forget you, Dory.

37
00:02:29,286 --> 00:02:31,897
And we know you'll never forget us.

38
00:03:11,943 --> 00:03:13,323
Hello?

39
00:03:15,821 --> 00:03:16,981
Hello!

40
00:03:18,199 --> 00:03:19,999
Did you hear that?
What's that? Hear what?

41
00:03:20,059 --> 00:03:21,754
Stan, I just heard someone say hello.

42
00:03:21,778 --> 00:03:23,300
Who? I didn't hear anybody say hello.

43
00:03:23,371 --> 00:03:24,478
I don't know, Stan.

44
00:03:24,503 --> 00:03:26,425
I just heard someone say hello.

45
00:03:26,991 --> 00:03:28,596
There's a lot of fish here.

46
00:03:28,597 --> 00:03:30,401
Anybody, literally anybody
could have just said hello.

47
00:03:30,461 --> 00:03:31,631
Hello?
There.

48
00:03:31,921 --> 00:03:33,374
Where?
There. There. Right there.

49
00:03:33,398 --> 00:03:34,558
Where am I looking?
There!

50
00:03:35,349 --> 00:03:36,529
Hello!

51
00:03:36,551 --> 00:03:37,775
Hello?

52
00:03:38,376 --> 00:03:39,775
Hello?
Oh my goodness, it's a child!

53
00:03:39,929 --> 00:03:40,752
Hello?
Hi, kid.

54
00:03:40,777 --> 00:03:42,220
Hello?
Over here. Hello?

55
00:03:42,244 --> 00:03:43,190
Hi.

56
00:03:43,290 --> 00:03:45,203
Hi. I'm Dory.

57
00:03:45,204 --> 00:03:46,760
Can you please help me?

58
00:03:46,786 --> 00:03:47,753
Hi, Dory.

59
00:03:48,478 --> 00:03:49,900
Dory are you lost?

60
00:03:49,947 --> 00:03:51,507
Where are your parents?

61
00:03:52,691 --> 00:03:54,531
I can't remember.

62
00:03:55,194 --> 00:03:56,204
Well we'll look around.

63
00:03:56,887 --> 00:03:58,157
Are any of these fish your parents?

64
00:04:03,411 --> 00:04:06,831
Hi, I'm Dory.
Can you please help me?

65
00:04:10,001 --> 00:04:12,341
Honey, you just...
you just said that.

66
00:04:13,254 --> 00:04:14,684
I did?

67
00:04:15,340 --> 00:04:16,488
I'm sorry.

68
00:04:16,813 --> 00:04:20,155
I suffer from short-term remembory loss.

69
00:04:20,294 --> 00:04:23,054
How awful.
Short-term memory loss?

70
00:04:23,214 --> 00:04:25,774
Ok just, you wait here for one second.
Ok, sweetie pie?

71
00:04:25,850 --> 00:04:27,717
Stan. Stan. Stan.
What? What?

72
00:04:27,718 --> 00:04:29,238
What do we do?
The poor thing is lost!

73
00:04:29,487 --> 00:04:30,147
I don't know.

74
00:04:30,148 --> 00:04:31,632
I mean what, what do you want me to do?
We have to do something.

75
00:04:31,633 --> 00:04:33,373
I mean.
She can't remember a thing!

76
00:04:33,398 --> 00:04:34,710
She could come from anywhere.

77
00:04:35,259 --> 00:04:37,473
You are. You are no help today.
I am just...

78
00:04:37,998 --> 00:04:39,459
Dory. Sweetie. How about we...

79
00:04:39,530 --> 00:04:40,650
She's gone.
Dory!

80
00:04:40,674 --> 00:04:41,915
That's not good.
Dory!

81
00:04:41,939 --> 00:04:43,236
Dory!
Dory!

82
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:44,935
Dory!

83
00:04:45,036 --> 00:04:47,986
I'm Dory. I lost my family.

84
00:04:48,387 --> 00:04:49,870

00:04:51,751 --> 00:04:55,131

Anyhoo, thanks but,

00:05:36,587 --> 00:05:39,127
Can't remember. Can't remember.
Can't remember.

98
00:05:40,675 --> 00:05:42,885
Hi! I'm Dory.

99
00:05:43,469 --> 00:05:44,759
Was it something I said?

100
00:05:44,929 --> 00:05:47,929
Kidding. Ok. Ok.
You're not coming back.

101
00:05:48,457 --> 00:05:49,932
I was looking for something and I...

102
00:05:50,557 --> 00:05:52,419
Ok, totally get it, date night.

103
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:53,355
Have fun.

104
00:05:53,771 --> 00:05:56,389
Well, I hope you find whatever
it is you're looking for.

105
00:05:56,590 --> 00:05:58,960
You and me both.
Any idea what that was?

106
00:05:59,527 --> 00:06:00,527
I'm sorry.

107
00:06:00,570 --> 00:06:01,570
I'm sorry.

108
00:06:01,612 --> 00:06:02,715
I'm sorry.

109
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:05,351
Ok. Guess we'll hang out another time.

110
00:06:05,376 --> 00:06:07,871
Don't be a stranger, stranger.

111
00:06:14,892 --> 00:06:17,212
A white boat!
They took my son!

112
00:06:17,795 --> 00:06:20,665
My son! Help me! Please!

113
00:06:20,798 --> 00:06:21,798
Watch out!

114
00:06:25,485 --> 00:06:27,639
Sorry!
Are you Ok?

115
00:06:27,805 --> 00:06:29,283
He's gone. He's gone.
There, there.

116
00:06:29,307 --> 00:06:30,692
No, he's gone.
It's all right.

117
00:06:30,816 --> 00:06:32,106
He's gone.
It'll be Ok.

118
00:06:32,130 --> 00:06:33,702
No, no, they took him away.

119
00:06:33,927 --> 00:06:35,440
I have to find the boat.

120
00:06:35,464 --> 00:06:36,313
A boat?

121
00:06:36,314 --> 00:06:37,332
Hey, I've seen a boat!

122
00:06:37,356 --> 00:06:38,296
You have?

123
00:06:38,683 --> 00:06:40,353
This way! It went this way! Follow me!

124
00:06:40,618 --> 00:06:43,618
Thank you! Thank you.
Thank you so much!

125
00:06:58,211 --> 00:06:59,004
Klaus.

126
00:07:00,029 --> 00:07:01,706
Klaus, the pinata's drooping.

127
00:07:05,176 --> 00:07:07,756
Hand me the ratchet wrench.
I can fix it.

128
00:07:14,852 --> 00:07:15,942
Hey, Marlin?

129
00:07:18,989 --> 00:07:20,979
Hey, guys, I was just...

130
00:07:22,251 --> 00:07:25,961
Dory! It's not time to get up yet.
You have to go back to bed.

131
00:07:26,030 --> 00:07:28,200
And remember, the anemone stings.

132
00:07:28,366 --> 00:07:30,616
Oh right. Yeah. Sorry.
Back to bed, back to bed.

133
00:07:35,081 --> 00:07:36,141
Hey, Marlin?

134
00:07:36,707 --> 00:07:39,207
Back to bed! That was it.
Very simple. Bed.

135
00:07:39,335 --> 00:07:40,335
Back to it.
Got it.

136
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:43,880
Hey, Marlin?

137
00:07:43,965 --> 00:07:46,925
And we're up. That's it.
Ready to start the day.

138
00:07:47,260 --> 00:07:49,390
And we were looking for something.
Nemo.

139
00:07:49,554 --> 00:07:51,934
Right. I remember it like it was yesterday.

140
00:07:52,398 --> 00:07:54,418
Of course, I don't really remember
yesterday all that well.

141
00:07:55,242 --> 00:07:59,082
Anyway, I would say the scariest
moment of the trip was the 4 sharks.

142
00:07:59,163 --> 00:08:01,003
Wait, I thought there were 3 sharks.

143
00:08:01,065 --> 00:08:03,395
No. No, there were definitely four.

144
00:08:03,568 --> 00:08:05,128
But last time you told it, there were three.

145
00:08:05,152 --> 00:08:07,737
Son, which one of us travelled
across the entire ocean?

146
00:08:07,738 --> 00:08:08,978
Nemo did.

147
00:08:09,365 --> 00:08:11,956
Obviously we had to cross
the ocean to find him so,

148
00:08:12,481 --> 00:08:13,686
you know, he went first.

149
00:08:16,831 --> 00:08:18,681
I guess that's true. Isn't it?

150
00:08:20,084 --> 00:08:22,326
Well, you made it!

151
00:08:22,827 --> 00:08:24,488
You almost missed the field trip.

152
00:08:24,512 --> 00:08:26,790
A field trip? I love field trips.
Where are we going?

153
00:08:26,857 --> 00:08:29,057
I thought you told her.
I did tell her!

154
00:08:30,026 --> 00:08:31,026
Dory.
Yeah.

155
00:08:31,561 --> 00:08:36,331
Mr Ray has too many fish
to keep an eye on today.

156
00:08:36,355 --> 00:08:37,183
So...

157
00:08:37,484 --> 00:08:39,308
it would be best if today,

158
00:08:39,533 --> 00:08:41,206
you weren't exactly,

159
00:08:42,131 --> 00:08:43,228
with the class.

160
00:08:43,324 --> 00:08:44,374
Why not?

161
00:08:44,391 --> 00:08:47,785
Well, you know, you have problems
remembering things sometimes.

162
00:08:47,786 --> 00:08:49,296
That's the one thing I can remember.

163
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:50,373
Yeah. Ok.

164
00:08:50,398 --> 00:08:53,532
And sometimes it's not your fault,
but it can cause you to wander.

165
00:08:53,809 --> 00:08:57,899
And Mr Ray doesn't really have time
to worry about fish who wander.

166
00:08:57,923 --> 00:08:58,371
Sure.

167
00:08:58,372 --> 00:09:01,024
In other words,
he doesn't have enough help.

168
00:09:01,025 --> 00:09:03,225
Poor guy.
You know, he's so overworked.

169
00:09:03,294 --> 00:09:04,813
You understand.
I totally understand now.

170
00:09:04,837 --> 00:09:05,397
Ok.

171
00:09:05,463 --> 00:09:06,123
Good.

172
00:09:06,247 --> 00:09:07,981
He wants me to be the teacher's assistant.

173
00:09:08,282 --> 00:09:09,832
No, not exactly.

174
00:09:09,856 --> 00:09:10,835
Well I am so honoured.

175
00:09:10,860 --> 00:09:13,395
I have never been
a teaching assistant before.

176
00:09:14,513 --> 00:09:16,573
Mr Ray! You got help.

177
00:09:19,324 --> 00:09:21,054
Okey dokey.

178
00:09:22,688 --> 00:09:24,478
All right, kids.
All right, kids.

179
00:09:24,649 --> 00:09:26,089
Today's the day!
Today's the day!

180
00:09:26,233 --> 00:09:28,823
Our field trip to the sting ray migration.

181
00:09:28,986 --> 00:09:29,736
Sting ray migration.

182
00:09:29,904 --> 00:09:31,994
Now, does anyone know why we migrate?

183
00:09:33,908 --> 00:09:35,344
Come on. You got to know this stuff.

184
00:09:35,368 --> 00:09:38,118
Migration is about going back to...

185
00:09:38,404 --> 00:09:39,494
Bed!
Yes!

186
00:09:39,572 --> 00:09:40,262
No.
No.

187
00:09:40,331 --> 00:09:41,334
The sand!

188
00:09:41,359 --> 00:09:44,466
No! Migration is about going home.

189
00:09:44,502 --> 00:09:46,002
Home.
Which is where you're from.

190
00:09:46,170 --> 00:09:47,003
Where you're from.

191
00:09:47,004 --> 00:09:48,613
Can someone tell me where they're from?

192
00:09:48,614 --> 00:09:49,858
I live by a giant rock.

193
00:09:49,983 --> 00:09:51,775
I live 3 coral caves away from here.

194
00:09:51,776 --> 00:09:53,576
My house is covered in algae.

195
00:09:53,644 --> 00:09:54,984
Where'd you grow up, Dory?

196
00:09:55,345 --> 00:09:56,095
Me?

197
00:09:57,620 --> 00:09:58,769
I don't know.

198
00:09:59,433 --> 00:10:00,479
My family?

199
00:10:01,304 --> 00:10:02,617
Where are they?

200
00:10:06,356 --> 00:10:07,356
Can I help you?

201
00:10:08,409 --> 00:10:09,814
I'm sorry. Did I forget again?

202
00:10:10,139 --> 00:10:11,179
You see, I suffer from...

203
00:10:11,203 --> 00:10:12,725
Short-term memory loss.

204
00:10:12,855 --> 00:10:16,375
How can you remember your family
if you have short-term memory loss?

205
00:10:16,467 --> 00:10:17,776
Good question. Good question.

206
00:10:17,777 --> 00:10:20,131
See, I can remember some
things because well...

207
00:10:20,379 --> 00:10:21,719
They make sense. Like...

208
00:10:21,743 --> 00:10:23,009
A while, I have a family.

209
00:10:23,073 --> 00:10:23,904
I, I know because I've...

210
00:10:23,929 --> 00:10:25,533
You know I must to come
from somewhere. Right?

211
00:10:25,559 --> 00:10:26,559
Everyone has a family,

212
00:10:26,627 --> 00:10:29,087
and I may not remember
their names and what they look like.

213
00:10:29,088 --> 00:10:31,528
And I may not even be able
to ever find them again, but...

214
00:10:32,717 --> 00:10:34,736
What were we talking about?
Mommies and daddies.

215
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:36,390
Mommies and daddies. Right.

216
00:10:36,554 --> 00:10:38,594
Why are we talking about
mommies and daddies?

217
00:10:40,558 --> 00:10:41,558
That class.

218
00:10:42,375 --> 00:10:43,375
Why me? Ok.

219
00:10:43,736 --> 00:10:45,429
You guys seem a little young, but...

220
00:10:45,854 --> 00:10:47,516
Ok. You see kids,

221
00:10:47,517 --> 00:10:49,067
when two fish love each other...

222
00:10:49,233 --> 00:10:51,443
And we'll stop right there.

223
00:10:51,662 --> 00:10:53,114
Climb aboard, explorers.

224
00:10:53,239 --> 00:10:56,466
I feel a migration song coming on.

Ok, that's too far.
That's too far.

Come on. Come on.

235
00:11:27,263 --> 00:11:28,582
Get back over here.
Back this way.

236
00:11:28,606 --> 00:11:31,776
Now, I need everyone to listen to me.
All right, listen up!

237
00:11:31,942 --> 00:11:34,588
When the rays pass through here...
The rays, gonna pass through.

238
00:11:34,612 --> 00:11:36,282
What do we have to be careful of?

239
00:11:36,447 --> 00:11:37,947
Everybody has to be careful of what?

240
00:11:38,115 --> 00:11:40,445
The undertow!
That's right.

241
00:11:40,534 --> 00:11:41,389
That's right.

242
00:11:41,414 --> 00:11:43,488
The under... The undertow?

243
00:11:44,997 --> 00:11:49,127
Because the current created
by all the flapping is very strong.

244
00:11:49,293 --> 00:11:51,463
And if you're not careful,
you can get pulled into...

245
00:11:51,629 --> 00:11:54,669
Mr Ray! So how do the stingrays
all know where to go?

246
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:57,170
That's what an instinct is, Nemo.

247
00:11:57,534 --> 00:12:01,714
Something deep inside you that feels
so familiar that you have to listen to it.

248
00:12:01,872 --> 00:12:04,250
Like a song you've always known.

249
00:12:05,075 --> 00:12:07,332

00:12:38,150 --> 00:12:38,990
Dory!

262
00:12:39,576 --> 00:12:40,976
Dory!

263
00:12:44,557 --> 00:12:45,557
Dory! Dory!

264
00:12:46,766 --> 00:12:47,910
Is she dead?

265
00:12:48,035 --> 00:12:49,586
Oh no.
No she's not dead.

266
00:12:49,711 --> 00:12:51,891
Oh man.
Give her some space, everybody.

267
00:12:52,014 --> 00:12:55,024
The Jewel of Morro Bay, California.

268
00:12:55,242 --> 00:12:57,732
The Jewel of Morro Bay, California?

269
00:12:58,787 --> 00:13:00,657
I remembered something so I...

270
00:13:01,298 --> 00:13:02,418
I remembered something!

271
00:13:02,441 --> 00:13:04,427
I actually remembered something!
Something important.

272
00:13:04,451 --> 00:13:06,551
Something important?
What? What was it?

273
00:13:07,737 --> 00:13:09,822
I'm not sure any more, but I can still feel it.

274
00:13:10,247 --> 00:13:11,841
It's right there.
All right, thank you, Mr Ray.

275
00:13:12,209 --> 00:13:15,629
Ok, come on. Try to remember better.
Don't be such a Dory, Dory.

276
00:13:17,096 --> 00:13:18,491
I don't know. I...

277
00:13:18,816 --> 00:13:19,986
Hold on. Hold on.

278
00:13:21,584 --> 00:13:22,754
What? Did you remember?

279
00:13:23,695 --> 00:13:25,685
I don't remember.
It was something... It was...

280
00:13:27,156 --> 00:13:28,236
It was something about...

281
00:13:28,767 --> 00:13:30,627
The Jewel of Morro Bay, California.

282
00:13:33,355 --> 00:13:35,895
My family!
I remember my family!

283
00:13:36,025 --> 00:13:37,945
They're out there somewhere.
I have to find them.

284
00:13:38,068 --> 00:13:40,368
Guys, you got to help me.
Guys! Guys! Hello?

285
00:13:41,572 --> 00:13:43,662
Guys! Where are you?

286
00:13:43,741 --> 00:13:45,081
Dory!
Hello?

287
00:13:45,242 --> 00:13:46,127
Dory!

288
00:13:47,752 --> 00:13:48,806
Where did you go?

289
00:13:48,812 --> 00:13:51,093
You were the one to go.
My parents. I remembered them.

290
00:13:51,281 --> 00:13:52,601
What? What did you remember?

291
00:13:52,666 --> 00:13:54,846
I remembered them! My mom. My dad.

292
00:13:54,919 --> 00:13:55,879
I have a family.

293
00:13:56,704 --> 00:13:58,983
They don't know where I am.
Let's go. We have to go.

294
00:13:59,023 --> 00:13:59,878
Dory. No!

295
00:13:59,903 --> 00:14:02,467
This is crazy!
Where exactly are you trying to go?

296
00:14:02,509 --> 00:14:05,069
To the... To the Gem of the...
of the Baltic?

297
00:14:05,137 --> 00:14:07,167
The Jewel of Morro Bay, California.
Yes!

298
00:14:07,298 --> 00:14:09,728
No, Dory. California's all the way
across the ocean.

299
00:14:09,850 --> 00:14:10,911
Then we'd better get going.

300
00:14:10,935 --> 00:14:14,088
How come every time
we're on the edge of this reef,

301
00:14:14,113 --> 00:14:15,707
one of us is trying to leave?

302
00:14:15,932 --> 00:14:17,710
For once, can't we just enjoy the view?

303
00:14:17,775 --> 00:14:20,375
How can you be talking about the view
when I remembered my family?

304
00:14:20,486 --> 00:14:22,507
No! No!
We've done our ocean travels.

305
00:14:22,632 --> 00:14:23,880
That part of our lives is over.

306
00:14:23,922 --> 00:14:26,222
The only reason to travel
in the first place is so,

307
00:14:26,283 --> 00:14:28,563
you don't have to travel ever again.
Yeah, but I want.

308
00:14:29,870 --> 00:14:31,450
Dory, look...
Please.

309
00:14:32,665 --> 00:14:33,931
All I know...

310
00:14:36,256 --> 00:14:37,509
is that I miss them.

311
00:14:39,630 --> 00:14:42,920
I really, really miss them.
I didn't know what that felt like.

312
00:14:45,135 --> 00:14:46,465
Do you know what that feels like?

313
00:14:52,977 --> 00:14:55,647
Yes, I know what that feels like.

314
00:14:57,231 --> 00:14:58,851
I don't want to forget this.

315
00:14:59,776 --> 00:15:00,802
Somewhere,

316
00:15:01,127 --> 00:15:02,949
out there is my family.

317
00:15:05,739 --> 00:15:06,879
Please Marlin,

318
00:15:07,604 --> 00:15:09,363
I can't find them on my own.

319
00:15:09,510 --> 00:15:10,596
I'll forget.

320
00:15:10,721 --> 00:15:12,784
Please help me find my family.

321
00:15:13,030 --> 00:15:16,420
Yeah Dad, you can get us all the way
across the ocean. Right?

322
00:15:17,334 --> 00:15:18,334
No.

323
00:15:21,714 --> 00:15:23,594
But I know a guy.

324
00:15:27,219 --> 00:15:30,809
Righteous, righteous, righteous!

325
00:15:48,323 --> 00:15:50,131
Totally sick.

326
00:15:50,356 --> 00:15:52,517
Totally sick.

327
00:15:52,661 --> 00:15:54,081
I know. Isn't it great?

328
00:15:54,246 --> 00:15:56,576
No! I'm gonna be totally sick.

329
00:15:56,749 --> 00:15:59,539
It's the California current, dude.
It's got some gnarly chop.

330
00:15:59,710 --> 00:16:01,170
Surf's up, dude!

331
00:16:02,755 --> 00:16:05,215
Hey, dude, if you're gonna hurl,
just do me a solid,

332
00:16:05,382 --> 00:16:08,432
head to the back of the shell,
lean out, and go for distance.

333
00:16:08,594 --> 00:16:10,604
We call that feeding the fishes.

334
00:16:10,763 --> 00:16:11,933
Correctamundo, Squirt!

335
00:16:12,097 --> 00:16:13,963
And now we're looking for my parents,

336
00:16:13,988 --> 00:16:16,001
at the Brooch of the Atlantic or the...

337
00:16:16,060 --> 00:16:18,150
The Jewel of Morro Bay, California.
Exactly!

338
00:16:18,228 --> 00:16:19,688
How are you gonna find your parents?

339
00:16:19,855 --> 00:16:21,645
Do you remember what they look like?

340
00:16:21,774 --> 00:16:23,668
I'm a bit new to the memory thing,
so I can't say for sure,

341
00:16:23,692 --> 00:16:27,502
but something tells me they were
mostly blue, with s... Maybe yellow.

342
00:16:27,571 --> 00:16:28,241
That sounds right.

343
00:16:28,405 --> 00:16:31,985
Also I'm pretty sure I'm gonna know
them when I see them. We're family.

344
00:16:32,009 --> 00:16:36,167
By the way crossing the ocean is the kind
of thing you should only do once.

345
00:16:36,192 --> 00:16:37,061
One time!

346
00:16:37,206 --> 00:16:39,626
Morro Bay, California's coming up, dudes.

347
00:16:40,751 --> 00:16:42,921
Let's find my family.

348
00:16:43,087 --> 00:16:44,247
Go! Go! Go, go, go.

349
00:16:44,421 --> 00:16:46,671
Just go, Dad.
Don't push me, Nemo.

350
00:16:52,221 --> 00:16:55,601
So long, Little Blue!
Hope you find your parents.

351
00:16:55,766 --> 00:16:57,596
And good luck feeding the fishes.

352
00:16:58,894 --> 00:17:00,604
Too late. Already fed.

353
00:17:06,151 --> 00:17:07,851
This feels familiar.

354
00:17:08,075 --> 00:17:09,512
Mom! Dad!

355
00:17:09,613 --> 00:17:11,373
No. Dory! Dory! Wait! Wait.

356
00:17:12,116 --> 00:17:13,946
Mom! Dad!

357
00:17:14,118 --> 00:17:15,607
Stop yelling for a second.

358
00:17:15,608 --> 00:17:19,247
Do you really think your parents are just
gonna be floating around here waiting for you?

359
00:17:19,414 --> 00:17:22,774
Well, I don't know, but there's only
one way to find out. Mom! Dad!

360
00:17:22,835 --> 00:17:25,455
Yell louder, Dory.
Mom! Dad!

361
00:17:26,629 --> 00:17:27,739
What was that?

362
00:17:27,965 --> 00:17:29,063
Wait.

363
00:17:29,188 --> 00:17:30,608
I've heard that before.

364
00:17:30,832 --> 00:17:32,403
I remember someone saying.

365
00:17:32,928 --> 00:17:35,188
Yes, well done. That was me.
One minute ago.

366
00:17:37,599 --> 00:17:40,889
Please. Have you seen
my mommy and daddy?

367
00:17:40,953 --> 00:17:43,213
Their names are Jenny and Charlie.

368
00:17:45,274 --> 00:17:47,904
Jenny and Charlie.

369
00:17:48,026 --> 00:17:48,856
What? Jenny and what?

370
00:17:48,944 --> 00:17:51,864
Those are their names!
My parents are Jenny and Charlie!

371
00:17:52,030 --> 00:17:53,070
Dory, wait!

372
00:17:53,094 --> 00:17:53,656
Jenny!

373
00:17:53,657 --> 00:17:54,691
Can't we just take a moment

374
00:17:54,715 --> 00:17:56,011
Charlie!
to come up with a plan?

375
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:58,050
Jenny! Charlie!

376
00:17:58,220 --> 00:18:00,730
Are you crazy?
Sorry, she's a little excited.

377
00:18:00,998 --> 00:18:03,708
Jenny! Charlie!
Dory, stop yelling for a second.

378
00:18:03,834 --> 00:18:06,504
It's not a good idea
to come into a new neighbourhood,

379
00:18:06,670 --> 00:18:09,050
and call this much attention to yourself.

380
00:18:09,214 --> 00:18:11,342
You don't understand,
I remembered my parent's names!

381
00:18:11,467 --> 00:18:12,709
Jenny! Charlie!
Dorry please!

382
00:18:13,142 --> 00:18:14,560
These crabs are locals,

383
00:18:14,585 --> 00:18:17,367
and I get the feeling they're
shushing us for a reason.

384
00:18:17,368 --> 00:18:19,274
You might wake up something dangerous.

385
00:18:19,474 --> 00:18:22,096
Are you talking about like something with one
big eye, tentacles, and a snappy thing?

386
00:18:22,527 --> 00:18:24,857
Well, that's very specific,
but something like that, yes.

387
00:18:25,022 --> 00:18:27,022
You just in general don't want to...

388
00:18:29,568 --> 00:18:32,468
Oh, I, my goodness. Ok.

389
00:18:32,738 --> 00:18:35,073
There's a mistake.
We're backing away.

390
00:18:35,198 --> 00:18:37,522
Let us live and we will...

391
00:18:37,567 --> 00:18:39,567
We'll worship you.
We'll build a...

392
00:18:40,292 --> 00:18:42,091
Do you like... Do you like a monument?

393
00:18:49,755 --> 00:18:54,295
Swim for your life!

394
00:19:11,735 --> 00:19:13,355
Nemo!
Nemo!

395
00:19:14,863 --> 00:19:15,323
Dad!

396
00:19:15,447 --> 00:19:16,527
Nemo!
Dad!

397
00:19:22,746 --> 00:19:23,746
No!

398
00:19:23,914 --> 00:19:26,254
Nemo, hold on to me and don't let go!

399
00:19:27,084 --> 00:19:28,084
Dad!

400
00:19:28,377 --> 00:19:29,377
No, no! No!

401
00:19:34,734 --> 00:19:35,882
Dory! Dory!

402
00:19:36,007 --> 00:19:38,349
Dory slow down!
We're not being chased any more.

403
00:19:38,428 --> 00:19:39,428
Are you sure?

404
00:19:43,267 --> 00:19:44,855
Jenny and Charlie.

405
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:46,961
Jenny and Charlie!

406
00:19:47,229 --> 00:19:48,463
I just remembered their names!

407
00:19:48,488 --> 00:19:50,133
We have to keep going.
We're so close.

408
00:19:50,574 --> 00:19:51,704
Are you hurt?

409
00:19:52,325 --> 00:19:53,759
Oh my goodness! Nemo!

410
00:19:53,884 --> 00:19:55,205
Are you Ok? What happened?

411
00:19:55,279 --> 00:19:56,949
Not now, Dory. Please!
Oh no.

412
00:19:57,114 --> 00:19:59,154
Oh no Nemo. Oh no.
I'm Ok. I'm Ok.

413
00:19:59,316 --> 00:20:01,776
Oh no Nemo.
I'm sorry. Ok. I'm sorry.

414
00:20:02,953 --> 00:20:03,991
Oh my goodness!

415
00:20:04,092 --> 00:20:06,193
Nemo, are you Ok?
I said, Not now.

416
00:20:06,218 --> 00:20:07,218
You've done enough.

417
00:20:07,242 --> 00:20:08,956
I have? Oh no.

418
00:20:09,281 --> 00:20:11,654
But I... I can fix it.
I. I can.

419
00:20:11,779 --> 00:20:13,807
I. I. I'll go get help.
No you know what you can do, Dory?

420
00:20:13,932 --> 00:20:15,331
You can go wait over there.

421
00:20:15,499 --> 00:20:17,493
Go wait over there and forget.

422
00:20:17,818 --> 00:20:19,213
It's what you do best.

423
00:20:21,430 --> 00:20:22,590
You're right.

424
00:20:22,915 --> 00:20:24,694
I don't know why I thought I could do this.

425
00:20:25,241 --> 00:20:27,826
Find my family. I can't do this.
I'm so sorry.

426
00:20:28,451 --> 00:20:29,627
I'll fix it.
I'm Ok.

427
00:20:29,652 --> 00:20:30,971
Well, I'm gonna get help. Ok?

428
00:20:31,206 --> 00:20:33,298
Ok? I can do that. I. I'll be...

429
00:20:33,323 --> 00:20:35,270
It'll be all right, Nemo.

430
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:40,660
Hello? Someone hello?

431
00:20:40,824 --> 00:20:43,704
Anyone? Hello? Anyone?

432
00:20:43,869 --> 00:20:45,329
Hello.

433
00:20:46,496 --> 00:20:48,866
Hello?
I'm Sigourney Weaver.

434
00:20:49,041 --> 00:20:50,985
Oh. Hi, Sigourney.

435
00:20:50,986 --> 00:20:52,305
I need your help.

436
00:20:52,402 --> 00:20:54,102
Won't you please join us.

437
00:20:54,129 --> 00:20:55,549
Oh. Great, great, great.

438
00:20:56,114 --> 00:20:59,074
As we explore the wonders of the Pacific Ocean,

439
00:20:59,134 --> 00:21:02,294
and the amazing life it holds within.

440
00:21:02,554 --> 00:21:04,724
Witness the majesty of the Beluga Whale.
Sigourney?

441
00:21:04,890 --> 00:21:06,250
Sigourney Weaver, where are you?

442
00:21:06,475 --> 00:21:08,252
Dory! There you are!
Guys!

443
00:21:08,377 --> 00:21:10,779
I found help. Sigourney Weaver's
gonna tell us where we are.

444
00:21:10,920 --> 00:21:11,920
Look out!

445
00:21:11,955 --> 00:21:14,615
Oh, look at this!
No respect for ocean life.

446
00:21:14,649 --> 00:21:16,459
Marlin! Nemo!
Dory!

447
00:21:16,483 --> 00:21:18,171
No, no, no. Not again! Not again!

448
00:21:18,195 --> 00:21:19,875
Let's take her inside and see how she does.

449
00:21:19,899 --> 00:21:20,899
Marl...

450
00:21:22,299 --> 00:21:23,369
Dory! Dory!

451
00:21:23,533 --> 00:21:27,203
Don't worry, Dory! Stay calm.
We'll come find you!

452
00:21:27,370 --> 00:21:29,870
And welcome to the Marine Life Institute,

453
00:21:30,040 --> 00:21:34,250
where we believe in Rescue,
Rehabilitation and Release.

454
00:21:36,505 --> 00:21:38,045
Marlin? Nemo?

455
00:21:43,678 --> 00:21:44,761
Hello? Hello?

456
00:21:45,186 --> 00:21:46,302
Can you help me?

457
00:21:46,448 --> 00:21:47,778
Me? Help you?

458
00:21:56,191 --> 00:21:58,361
Help. What's happening? Help.

459
00:21:58,527 --> 00:21:59,687
Looks like we're done here.

460
00:21:59,861 --> 00:22:02,181
Dude, cut it out.
You're a scientist. We talked about this.

461
00:22:02,280 --> 00:22:03,620
Come on. It's funny.

462
00:22:09,746 --> 00:22:12,456
Oh boy. Ok. This is...

463
00:22:12,541 --> 00:22:14,981
I'll be fine, I just need to find a way out and...

464
00:22:23,969 --> 00:22:25,053
If I could just...

465
00:22:25,378 --> 00:22:26,423
Get a hold of yourself.

466
00:22:27,597 --> 00:22:29,827
You'll be fine, everything's fine,
think positively.

467
00:22:30,700 --> 00:22:31,500
Hey you?

468
00:22:31,977 --> 00:22:32,807
Spinner.

469
00:22:33,478 --> 00:22:35,438
Thank goodness.
Hi, I'm Dory. I'm...

470
00:22:35,464 --> 00:22:36,464
Name's Hank.

471
00:22:36,888 --> 00:22:38,779
How sick are you?
Sick? I'm sick?

472
00:22:38,803 --> 00:22:39,953
Why else would you be in quarantine?

473
00:22:39,977 --> 00:22:42,150
Oh no! How long do I have?
I have to find my family.

474
00:22:42,195 --> 00:22:44,160
All right. Now don't get hysterical, oh, oh.

475
00:22:44,485 --> 00:22:44,939
Not good.

476
00:22:44,990 --> 00:22:46,420
What? What is it?
What happened?

477
00:22:47,145 --> 00:22:49,434
What's that?
That there is bad news.

478
00:22:49,619 --> 00:22:52,929
It's a transport tag for fish
who can't cut it inside the institute.

479
00:22:52,998 --> 00:22:56,228
They get transferred to permanent digs.
An aquarium.

480
00:22:56,293 --> 00:22:57,783
In Cleveland.

481
00:22:58,420 --> 00:23:00,700
Fish in here, go back in the ocean.

482
00:23:00,825 --> 00:23:03,304
Cleveland fish, stay there forever.

483
00:23:03,592 --> 00:23:05,932
Cleveland? No!
I can't go to the Cleveland.

484
00:23:05,956 --> 00:23:08,934
I have to get to the Jewel of Morro
Bay, California and find my family.

485
00:23:09,097 --> 00:23:11,156
That's this place.
The Marine Life Institute.

486
00:23:11,257 --> 00:23:14,047
The Jewel of Morro Bay, California.
You're here.

487
00:23:14,071 --> 00:23:15,154
You mean I'm from here?

488
00:23:15,586 --> 00:23:17,746
My parents are here.
I have to get to them.

489
00:23:17,814 --> 00:23:19,224
So what exhibit are you from?

490
00:23:19,390 --> 00:23:20,694
Wait. I'm from an exhibit?

491
00:23:20,719 --> 00:23:22,374
Which one?
I have to get there.

492
00:23:23,419 --> 00:23:24,649
That's a hard one, kid.

493
00:23:24,813 --> 00:23:25,856
Unless...

494
00:23:27,481 --> 00:23:29,184
Never work, it's too crazy.

495
00:23:29,209 --> 00:23:31,049
What do you mean? Just tell me.
I'm Ok with crazy.

496
00:23:31,077 --> 00:23:32,250
You know I could see that?

497
00:23:32,275 --> 00:23:35,776
Well, there's one thing I can think
of to help you get to your family.

498
00:23:35,801 --> 00:23:37,034
If I just take...

499
00:23:37,375 --> 00:23:39,643
Yes! Great idea.
You take me to find them.

500
00:23:39,644 --> 00:23:40,734
Why didn't I think of that?

501
00:23:41,195 --> 00:23:43,765
No, no, no.
If I just take your tag,

502
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:45,932
I can take your place on the transport truck,

503
00:23:46,057 --> 00:23:48,668
then you can go back inside
and find your family.

504
00:23:48,793 --> 00:23:50,871
All you have to do is give me the tag.

505
00:23:51,014 --> 00:23:53,264
What tag?
There's a tag on my fin!

506
00:23:53,283 --> 00:23:55,643
How could you forget
you have a tag on your fin?

507
00:23:55,769 --> 00:23:57,283
Oh no. I'm sorry. I...

508
00:23:57,508 --> 00:23:59,813
I suffer from short-term memory loss.

509
00:24:00,523 --> 00:24:02,609
You don't remember
what we were talking about?

510
00:24:03,233 --> 00:24:05,203
Not a clue.
What were we talking about?

511
00:24:06,528 --> 00:24:07,958
You were about to give me your tag.

512
00:24:08,031 --> 00:24:10,161
Well, I kind of like my tag.
Why do you want it?

513
00:24:10,283 --> 00:24:11,283
So I can go to...

514
00:24:12,619 --> 00:24:14,329
So I can go to Cleveland.

515
00:24:14,496 --> 00:24:15,296
Cleveland?

516
00:24:15,420 --> 00:24:16,933
I hear good things about Cleveland.
Why do you want to go?

517
00:24:16,957 --> 00:24:19,210
Because if I stay here I'm gonna get
released back to the ocean.

518
00:24:19,334 --> 00:24:21,504
And I have extremely
unpleasant memories of that place.

519
00:24:23,171 --> 00:24:25,261
I just want to live in a glass box alone.

520
00:24:25,285 --> 00:24:26,637
That's all I want.

521
00:24:26,962 --> 00:24:27,977
So give me your tag!

522
00:24:28,518 --> 00:24:29,848
Hey man, don't touch my tag!

523
00:24:32,722 --> 00:24:33,722
Look...

524
00:24:39,896 --> 00:24:42,896
I don't work here.
It's not like I have a map of this place.

525
00:24:43,066 --> 00:24:44,276
A map! Good idea.

526
00:24:44,442 --> 00:24:45,489
You take me to the map,

527
00:24:45,514 --> 00:24:47,516
I figure out where my parents are.
Oh boy.

528
00:24:48,446 --> 00:24:49,464
All right.

529
00:24:50,089 --> 00:24:52,241
If I get you to your family will you give me...

530
00:24:52,242 --> 00:24:53,331
I don't have much.

531
00:24:53,956 --> 00:24:55,920
I... How about if I give you this tag?

532
00:24:56,955 --> 00:24:58,165
Great idea.

533
00:25:04,629 --> 00:25:06,629
Are you absolutely sure that's what I said?

534
00:25:06,798 --> 00:25:09,588
Go wait over there and forget.
That's what you do best.

535
00:25:09,759 --> 00:25:10,799
Yeah, Dad.
I said that?

536
00:25:10,927 --> 00:25:12,717
You said that, Dory swam to the surface,

537
00:25:12,804 --> 00:25:14,004
and she got taken by some...

538
00:25:14,028 --> 00:25:15,533
All right, I don't want to hear
the whole story again.

539
00:25:15,557 --> 00:25:17,275
I was just asking about the one part,

540
00:25:17,300 --> 00:25:18,791
because, look, if I said that...

541
00:25:19,135 --> 00:25:20,556
I'm not positive I did.

542
00:25:20,581 --> 00:25:22,275
It's actually a compliment,

543
00:25:22,300 --> 00:25:23,892
because I asked her to wait,

544
00:25:24,217 --> 00:25:25,863
and I said It's what you do best.

545
00:25:26,109 --> 00:25:27,117
So, I, I...

546
00:25:27,342 --> 00:25:29,133
Oh, it's my fault!

547
00:25:29,379 --> 00:25:31,937
It's all my fault she got
kidnapped and taken into...

548
00:25:32,062 --> 00:25:33,243
whatever this place is.

549
00:25:33,383 --> 00:25:35,013
What if it's a restaurant?

550
00:25:35,276 --> 00:25:37,506
You two! Shut it!

551
00:25:37,579 --> 00:25:39,233
Yeah, we're trying to sleep!

552
00:25:39,558 --> 00:25:41,543
You interrupted my favourite dream!

553
00:25:41,583 --> 00:25:43,383
Is that the one about you laying on this rock?

554
00:25:43,460 --> 00:25:44,045
Yeah.

555
00:25:44,070 --> 00:25:45,824
Oh, that is a good one.

556
00:25:45,962 --> 00:25:47,773
Oh yeah, isn't it? Yeah.
It's one of my favourites.

557
00:25:47,797 --> 00:25:48,547
Excuse us!

558
00:25:48,548 --> 00:25:49,688
Son! Son.
Hello?

559
00:25:49,712 --> 00:25:51,157
We're trying to...
Those are sea lions.

560
00:25:51,182 --> 00:25:52,667
They are natural predators.

561
00:25:52,802 --> 00:25:54,082
They could pounce at any moment.

562
00:25:55,889 --> 00:25:57,599
They don't look very pouncy.

563
00:25:57,866 --> 00:25:59,406
That's what they want you to think.

564
00:25:59,476 --> 00:26:02,246
Just get behind me and let me do the talking.

565
00:26:02,312 --> 00:26:05,732
Excuse me, we're worried
about our friend. Is that a restaurant?

566
00:26:07,192 --> 00:26:10,652
Mate, it's not a restaurant.
Your friend is Ok.

567
00:26:10,920 --> 00:26:13,050
She is?
It's a fish hospital.

568
00:26:13,114 --> 00:26:17,474
Sigourney Weaver says she'll be rescued,
rehabilitated and released.

569
00:26:17,535 --> 00:26:19,535
She'll be in and out in a jiff.
We should know.

570
00:26:19,704 --> 00:26:21,294
Nasal parasite.
Anaemia.

571
00:26:21,456 --> 00:26:23,036
All fixed up and sent on our way.

572
00:26:24,466 --> 00:26:25,846
Thank goodness.

573
00:26:25,876 --> 00:26:28,576
Sure, that's all right.
Don't you worry ab...

574
00:26:29,464 --> 00:26:31,776
Gerald, get off the rock!
Shove off, Gerald! Come on.

575
00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:32,969
Get of! Now you know better!

576
00:26:35,845 --> 00:26:37,858
Don't you worry about a thing.

577
00:26:38,083 --> 00:26:40,900
That place is the Marine Life Institute.

578
00:26:40,950 --> 00:26:43,340
The Jewel of Morro Bay, California.

579
00:26:43,561 --> 00:26:44,841
She was right.

580
00:26:45,021 --> 00:26:47,191
It looks like Dory
can do something besides forget.

581
00:26:47,657 --> 00:26:49,247
Thank you, Nemo. Thank you for that.

582
00:26:49,417 --> 00:26:50,957
So how are we gonna get inside?

583
00:26:50,981 --> 00:26:53,026
Wait. You want to get inside MLI?

584
00:26:53,196 --> 00:26:55,866
Desperately. Our friend is in there.
Lost, alone.

585
00:26:56,032 --> 00:26:58,202
She's scared.
She'll have no idea what to do.

586
00:26:59,568 --> 00:27:01,308
We know a way.

587
00:27:01,538 --> 00:27:02,608
You do?

588
00:27:05,975 --> 00:27:08,229
What are they doing?
I don't know. It sounds bad.

589
00:27:09,712 --> 00:27:11,342
Are we there yet?
Keep it down!

590
00:27:11,506 --> 00:27:15,651
Hank, I'm so glad I found you.
It feels like... I... Destiny.

591
00:27:15,652 --> 00:27:18,452
For what must be the millionth time,
it's not destiny.

592
00:27:18,713 --> 00:27:20,973
Have I said destiny before?
I'm sorry.

593
00:27:21,132 --> 00:27:23,152
I'm just so nervous because
I'm gonna meet my parents.

594
00:27:23,184 --> 00:27:25,938
I haven't seen them in.
I don't even know how long because,

595
00:27:25,962 --> 00:27:27,873
you see I suffer from short-term...
Short-term memory loss.

596
00:27:27,897 --> 00:27:29,667
Look, no more talking. Ok?
I don't like talking.

597
00:27:29,691 --> 00:27:32,271
I don't like chatter and questions.
And, How are you? Oh I'm fine.

598
00:27:32,295 --> 00:27:35,238
How are you? I'm fine too.
News flash, nobody's fine.

599
00:27:35,572 --> 00:27:36,612
I'm fine. How are you?

600
00:27:37,915 --> 00:27:39,215
Hank, look, there's a map!

601
00:27:39,942 --> 00:27:42,555
The plan is you're gonna read that
and figure out where your parents live.

602
00:27:42,779 --> 00:27:44,519
Then I'm on the truck to Cleveland.
You got it?

603
00:27:44,581 --> 00:27:46,751
Got it.
What was the first part again?

604
00:27:48,334 --> 00:27:49,520
What? The octopus escaped again?

605
00:27:50,644 --> 00:27:52,334
Look at all the exhibits.

606
00:27:52,355 --> 00:27:54,355
How can you do this park in one day?
Seriously.

607
00:27:54,424 --> 00:27:55,524
Pick one!
Ok.

608
00:27:56,759 --> 00:27:58,994
Well, tell everyone to keep an eye out.
I mean.

609
00:27:58,995 --> 00:28:02,015
We're supposed to be releasing
the octopus back to the ocean today.

610
00:28:04,767 --> 00:28:07,297
Well, of course I haven't seen him.
If I was looking I'd find him.

611
00:28:08,170 --> 00:28:08,750
Hank!

612
00:28:08,875 --> 00:28:09,914
There you are.

613
00:28:10,014 --> 00:28:11,424
Hurry up!
Ok. Ok.

614
00:28:11,482 --> 00:28:16,742
K. It starts with a k.
Kid z-own-y. Kid zone!

615
00:28:16,905 --> 00:28:18,815
No! No kids. Kids grab things.

616
00:28:19,107 --> 00:28:20,877
And I'm not losing another tentacle for you.

617
00:28:21,050 --> 00:28:22,091
You lost a tentacle?

618
00:28:22,116 --> 00:28:25,028
Well then you're not an octopus,
you're a septopus.

619
00:28:25,096 --> 00:28:26,436
I may not remember, but I can count.

620
00:28:26,597 --> 00:28:27,887
Hurry up!
Ok.

621
00:28:28,516 --> 00:28:31,676
Journey to the... Hey, look. Shells.

622
00:28:33,963 --> 00:28:35,383
Hey, look. Shells!

623
00:28:36,841 --> 00:28:38,471
Daddy, here's a shell for you.

624
00:28:38,635 --> 00:28:41,135
That's great, Dory.
You found another one.

625
00:28:41,304 --> 00:28:43,454
I did?
Oh, yes, you did.

626
00:28:43,514 --> 00:28:44,934
You're getting good at this, Dory.

627
00:28:48,102 --> 00:28:49,482
Hey, look. Shells!

628
00:28:50,980 --> 00:28:52,483
Hey, I live there.

629
00:28:52,508 --> 00:28:53,994
Yes! Yes, indeed.

630
00:28:54,092 --> 00:28:55,412
I like shells.

631
00:28:56,337 --> 00:28:57,816
That's right, dear.

632
00:28:59,155 --> 00:29:01,315
Do you think you could find me
another shell?

633
00:29:02,033 --> 00:29:03,763
Purple ones are my favourite.

634
00:29:05,787 --> 00:29:07,057
Ok, Mommy.

635
00:29:08,831 --> 00:29:09,831
Mommy.

636
00:29:09,956 --> 00:29:11,631
Purple shell. Purple shell!

637
00:29:11,755 --> 00:29:13,555
Hey, my home had a purple shell.

638
00:29:13,579 --> 00:29:16,115
So what? Half the exhibits here
have purple shells in them.

639
00:29:16,139 --> 00:29:18,317
No, no, no. You don't understand.
I remember her now.

640
00:29:18,341 --> 00:29:20,941
Purple shells were her favourite
and she had this adorable giggle.

641
00:29:21,052 --> 00:29:22,446
And then my dad was really friendly.

642
00:29:22,470 --> 00:29:24,350
And now your wacky memory's
gonna get us caught.

643
00:29:28,184 --> 00:29:29,484
Still think this is destiny?

644
00:29:29,644 --> 00:29:31,284
Hank, we have to find my folks!
Quiet!

645
00:29:39,960 --> 00:29:41,340
Base, this is Carol.

646
00:29:42,006 --> 00:29:44,626
I think I might have found
that missing octopus. Over.

647
00:29:45,576 --> 00:29:46,906
See what you did?
Sorry.

648
00:29:47,078 --> 00:29:48,408
This could not be worse.

649
00:29:49,579 --> 00:29:51,649
Destiny.

650
00:29:52,350 --> 00:29:53,575
Destiny.
Come on?

651
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:54,600
Hank?

652
00:29:55,024 --> 00:29:56,955
I got a feeling.
I think we should get in the bucket.

653
00:29:56,979 --> 00:29:59,149
No. Stop.
Seriously. It says destiny and it is...

654
00:29:59,215 --> 00:30:00,859
No, no, no, no, no.
We've got to get in that bucket.

655
00:30:00,883 --> 00:30:02,479
I'm not going with you in that bucket.

656
00:30:02,904 --> 00:30:05,207
Here... I... go... in...
the... bucket. Bye.

657
00:30:07,598 --> 00:30:09,848
Hey, guys, I'm looking for my family.

658
00:30:11,373 --> 00:30:12,622
Good idea. Play dead.

659
00:30:19,110 --> 00:30:20,908
I'm sorry. I got to blink.

660
00:30:20,909 --> 00:30:22,714
How do you hold your
eyes open that long?

661
00:30:33,750 --> 00:30:34,766
Hey, guys.

662
00:30:36,291 --> 00:30:37,414
Wait a second.

663
00:30:43,843 --> 00:30:47,062
Our next guest has been
here a very long time.

664
00:30:47,063 --> 00:30:50,973
She's a whale shark.
Her name is Destiny.

665
00:30:51,092 --> 00:30:52,242
Destiny? Really?

666
00:30:52,268 --> 00:30:54,900
You'll notice she's extremely near-sighted

667
00:30:54,901 --> 00:30:57,412
and has trouble navigating her environment.

668
00:30:58,437 --> 00:30:59,754
And here she comes now.

669
00:31:01,059 --> 00:31:02,276
Destiny.

670
00:31:02,801 --> 00:31:03,883
You're a fish?

671
00:31:05,239 --> 00:31:06,699
Wait. What?

672
00:31:06,824 --> 00:31:08,434
Hi! Hello there.

673
00:31:08,458 --> 00:31:09,658
Can you help me...

674
00:31:11,287 --> 00:31:12,957
All right, I'll go with you.

675
00:31:13,831 --> 00:31:14,928
Excuse me. I.

676
00:31:15,353 --> 00:31:17,515
Who is that fish?
Is that blue blob talking?

677
00:31:17,518 --> 00:31:20,098
Can you help me? I lost my family.
You lost your family?

678
00:31:20,162 --> 00:31:21,312
Well, it's a long story,

679
00:31:21,336 --> 00:31:23,208
and truth be told,
I don't remember most of it.

680
00:31:23,432 --> 00:31:24,922
That is so sad.
You poor thi...

681
00:31:28,137 --> 00:31:30,567
Sorry. Not a great swimmer.

682
00:31:30,991 --> 00:31:33,061
I can't see very well.
I think you swim beautifully.

683
00:31:33,142 --> 00:31:35,262
In fact, I've never seen a fish
swim like that before.

684
00:31:35,611 --> 00:31:37,221
Thank you.

685
00:31:37,246 --> 00:31:39,746
You're welcome.

686
00:31:39,916 --> 00:31:41,136
Wait. Say that again.

687
00:31:41,567 --> 00:31:44,287
You're welcome.

688
00:31:44,453 --> 00:31:45,763
Dory?
Yes.

689
00:31:45,822 --> 00:31:46,822
Dory?
Yes.

690
00:31:46,948 --> 00:31:47,948
Dory?
Yes.

691
00:31:48,432 --> 00:31:49,622
Dory!
Yes.

692
00:31:49,742 --> 00:31:51,212
You and I were friends!

693
00:31:51,236 --> 00:31:52,035
No!

694
00:31:52,036 --> 00:31:53,596
Dory, it's me! Destiny!

695
00:31:53,620 --> 00:31:54,562
You know me?

696
00:31:54,563 --> 00:31:57,233
Of course! We talked through
the pipes when we were little.

697
00:31:57,299 --> 00:31:59,129
We were pipe pals!
We were?

698
00:32:00,010 --> 00:32:01,060
You're so pretty.

699
00:32:01,285 --> 00:32:02,550
So you know where I'm from?
Yep.

700
00:32:02,713 --> 00:32:04,593
You are from the Open Ocean exhibit.

701
00:32:04,690 --> 00:32:06,110
I'm from the Open Ocean exhibit?

702
00:32:06,575 --> 00:32:07,955
Then that's where my parents are.

703
00:32:08,044 --> 00:32:09,438
We got to go. Can you take me there?

704
00:32:10,162 --> 00:32:12,332
Kind of tough for a whale
to travel around here.

705
00:32:12,356 --> 00:32:15,588
Can you please keep it down over there?
My head hurts.

706
00:32:15,676 --> 00:32:16,676
Who's that?

707
00:32:16,861 --> 00:32:19,164
That's my neighbour, Bailey.
He was brought in with a head injury.

708
00:32:19,188 --> 00:32:20,415
I know you're talking about me, Destiny.

709
00:32:20,439 --> 00:32:22,309
He thinks he can't use his echolocation,

710
00:32:22,333 --> 00:32:24,920
but I've overheard the doctors talking.
There's not a thing wrong with him.

711
00:32:24,944 --> 00:32:26,864
Hear every word you're saying about me.

712
00:32:26,988 --> 00:32:28,128
What's echolocation?

713
00:32:28,297 --> 00:32:30,415
Bailey's head is supposed to put out a call

714
00:32:30,416 --> 00:32:33,177
and the echo helps him
find objects far away.

715
00:32:33,502 --> 00:32:36,358
But apparently he's still healing.

716
00:32:37,155 --> 00:32:38,685
Now I know you're talking about me.

717
00:32:38,774 --> 00:32:41,740
I really can't echolocate.
I cannot have this conversation again.

718
00:32:41,764 --> 00:32:44,407
I just can't.
I hit my head very hard out there.

719
00:32:44,432 --> 00:32:45,527
See how swollen it is!

720
00:32:45,564 --> 00:32:48,164
Your head is supposed to be big!
You're a beluga!

721
00:32:48,225 --> 00:32:49,975
Echolocation.

722
00:32:50,260 --> 00:32:52,510
Like, like the world's most powerful
pair of glasses?

723
00:32:52,688 --> 00:32:53,858
What?
What are glasses?

724
00:32:53,981 --> 00:32:55,071
It's sort of like you go...

725
00:32:55,858 --> 00:32:57,146
and then you see things.

726
00:32:57,371 --> 00:32:58,648
Why do I know that?

727
00:33:00,077 --> 00:33:01,397
That's interesting.

728
00:33:03,966 --> 00:33:05,056
There you are!

729
00:33:05,181 --> 00:33:06,700
Listen up, you and I are square.

730
00:33:06,744 --> 00:33:09,112
I took you to the map,
now give me that tag!

731
00:33:09,113 --> 00:33:10,156
Wait, wait, wait no.

732
00:33:10,281 --> 00:33:11,700
I know where my parents are.
They're in a...

733
00:33:12,024 --> 00:33:13,562
What's it called? The place...

734
00:33:13,687 --> 00:33:15,292
The soap and lotion?
Open Ocean.

735
00:33:15,417 --> 00:33:16,321
Open Ocean!

736
00:33:16,562 --> 00:33:18,922
Open Ocean!
I know where that is.

737
00:33:18,989 --> 00:33:21,919
That's the exhibit located right next to...
I don't care.

738
00:33:22,084 --> 00:33:22,924
Easy!

739
00:33:23,002 --> 00:33:25,922
If you're trying to get to the Open Ocean
exhibit go through the pipes.

740
00:33:26,288 --> 00:33:28,498
Through the pipes. Great.
Through the pipes?

741
00:33:28,666 --> 00:33:30,746
Yep. Take two lefts, swim straight
and you'll hit it.

742
00:33:31,435 --> 00:33:33,488
That's a lot of directions.
That's...

743
00:33:33,613 --> 00:33:34,915
Did you get that, Hank?
They all, all that?

744
00:33:34,947 --> 00:33:35,967
Oh yeah.

745
00:33:35,991 --> 00:33:37,265
Great! Let's go.

746
00:33:37,466 --> 00:33:39,619
I'm not going with you.
I won't fit.

747
00:33:39,744 --> 00:33:41,070
You have to go by yourself.

748
00:33:44,106 --> 00:33:45,499
That's... I'm... I...

749
00:33:46,124 --> 00:33:49,719
I see, I can't because I'm
not so good with directions.

750
00:33:49,720 --> 00:33:51,372
Well, that's too bad.
A deal's a deal.

751
00:33:51,397 --> 00:33:52,594
You wanted to find your parents?

752
00:33:52,631 --> 00:33:54,591
That's how you get to them.
Now give me your tag.

753
00:33:54,659 --> 00:33:57,619
But, Hank, I can't go in the pipes alone.
I'll forget where I'm going.

754
00:33:57,620 --> 00:33:58,788
Not my problem. Tag!

755
00:33:59,213 --> 00:34:00,764
But I can't get in that way.

756
00:34:00,865 --> 00:34:02,346
I'm sorry, but there's no other way!

757
00:34:02,471 --> 00:34:03,589
There's no other way.

758
00:34:05,628 --> 00:34:08,968
There's no other way.
Now, now. Don't panic.

759
00:34:09,131 --> 00:34:10,144
It's Ok.

760
00:34:10,169 --> 00:34:13,506
Not everything in life is easy to do.
Isn't that right, Charlie?

761
00:34:13,644 --> 00:34:14,901
Yeah, your mother is right.

762
00:34:14,902 --> 00:34:17,845
When something's too hard Dory,
you should just give up.

763
00:34:17,845 --> 00:34:18,745
Charlie!

764
00:34:18,764 --> 00:34:20,124
A joke. I'm kidding!

765
00:34:20,125 --> 00:34:21,634
Just a joke. A joke.

766
00:34:21,759 --> 00:34:23,515
Caution, joker at work.

767
00:34:23,521 --> 00:34:24,811
Joke. I got it.

768
00:34:25,681 --> 00:34:28,551
You see, kelpcake?
There's always another way.

769
00:34:30,194 --> 00:34:31,904
Thank you, Daddy.

770
00:34:32,989 --> 00:34:34,489
Thank you, Daddy.

771
00:34:35,273 --> 00:34:37,463
Nope. My father said
there's always another way.

772
00:34:37,483 --> 00:34:38,958
What? There is no other way.

773
00:34:39,183 --> 00:34:40,773
Open Ocean. Open Ocean.

774
00:34:40,913 --> 00:34:41,906
Open Ocean.

775
00:34:42,531 --> 00:34:44,408
I'm pretty sure it's the building over there.

776
00:34:44,466 --> 00:34:47,716
That's ill-defined and roundish.
Like Bailey's head.

777
00:34:47,986 --> 00:34:49,846
Wait, what?
Always another way. There's...

778
00:34:50,014 --> 00:34:51,007
There!

779
00:34:51,232 --> 00:34:52,631
Guys, follow me.

780
00:34:52,632 --> 00:34:53,875
I know how we can get to locomotion.

781
00:34:53,883 --> 00:34:55,623
Open Ocean. Open Ocean.
Exactly.

782
00:34:56,428 --> 00:34:57,326
Guys!

783
00:34:57,351 --> 00:34:59,843
Guys! You know I can't swim
over there, right?

784
00:35:03,436 --> 00:35:05,596
I don't see how this
is going to get us inside.

785
00:35:05,988 --> 00:35:07,238
What are you even doing?

786
00:35:07,506 --> 00:35:09,054
We're calling her over, of course.

787
00:35:09,055 --> 00:35:11,205
Calling her over? Calling who over?

788
00:35:15,748 --> 00:35:16,386
Lads,

789
00:35:17,111 --> 00:35:18,242
meet Becky.

790
00:35:19,702 --> 00:35:21,636
Flying? No, no, no, no, no.

791
00:35:21,660 --> 00:35:23,787
No, no, no, no new information.

792
00:35:24,122 --> 00:35:25,482
Listen, tell her thank you.

793
00:35:25,507 --> 00:35:27,677
You guys have gone
above and beyond. Really.

794
00:35:28,143 --> 00:35:32,163
But is there a way to get in
that involves, like, swimming?

795
00:35:32,222 --> 00:35:33,681
Because that's really our strength.

796
00:35:33,682 --> 00:35:36,312
Look, your friend is going to be
in quarantine.

797
00:35:36,535 --> 00:35:38,245
That's where they take the sick fish.

798
00:35:38,304 --> 00:35:42,214
And the one and only one way
into that place is Becky.

799
00:35:44,935 --> 00:35:46,345
Hi, Becky.

800
00:35:47,337 --> 00:35:49,767
Stop. Let's call her Pecky,
because this is hurting.

801
00:35:49,840 --> 00:35:51,180
I think she likes you, Dad.

802
00:35:51,341 --> 00:35:52,484
Becky, love?

803
00:35:52,609 --> 00:35:56,112
These two nice fish,
need to get into quarantine.

804
00:35:56,172 --> 00:35:58,012
Are you free today, Rebecca darling?

805
00:35:58,432 --> 00:35:59,472
Becky, is...

806
00:35:59,597 --> 00:36:01,416
Would that work with your schedule?

807
00:36:02,252 --> 00:36:03,802
She doesn't understand what I'm saying.

808
00:36:03,929 --> 00:36:06,519
All you have to do is imprint with her, mate.

809
00:36:06,840 --> 00:36:08,370
Imp... What?
Imprint.

810
00:36:08,434 --> 00:36:10,382
Look her in the eye and say...

811
00:36:11,107 --> 00:36:12,848
and she'll be in sync with you.

812
00:36:12,988 --> 00:36:15,568
Now look her in the eye.
Yeah.

813
00:36:16,858 --> 00:36:17,558
Nemo.

814
00:36:18,183 --> 00:36:19,882
I think we should devise an alternate plan.

815
00:36:20,329 --> 00:36:22,899
One that involves staying in the water
and someone sane.

816
00:36:23,165 --> 00:36:24,943
Because this bird, this bird...

817
00:36:25,068 --> 00:36:26,229
This ain't the bird!

818
00:36:26,253 --> 00:36:27,315
That's fine, Dad.

819
00:36:27,339 --> 00:36:29,190
And in the meantime,
Dory will just forget us.

820
00:36:29,338 --> 00:36:31,218
Like you said, it's what she does best.

821
00:36:32,081 --> 00:36:33,111
Fine.

822
00:36:35,511 --> 00:36:36,311
Ok,

823
00:36:36,651 --> 00:36:38,108
Look her in the eye.

824
00:36:38,233 --> 00:36:39,719
Which, which eye?

825
00:36:39,743 --> 00:36:41,348
Just pick one, mate.

826
00:36:41,517 --> 00:36:42,517
Becky.

827
00:36:47,689 --> 00:36:52,319
Becky.

828
00:36:55,072 --> 00:36:55,897
Ok,

829
00:36:56,122 --> 00:36:57,796
this is all great.

830
00:36:59,034 --> 00:37:01,554
How exactly is Becky supposed to carry us?

831
00:37:02,079 --> 00:37:04,322
Oh yeah.
I almost forgot.

832
00:37:04,747 --> 00:37:05,794
Gerald!

833
00:37:06,041 --> 00:37:07,631
Yeah, Gerald.

834
00:37:07,793 --> 00:37:09,013
Come on, son.

835
00:37:09,920 --> 00:37:11,819
Come on, Gerald.

836
00:37:11,820 --> 00:37:12,981
Give us your pail,

837
00:37:13,006 --> 00:37:14,344
we'll let you sit on the rock.

838
00:37:14,683 --> 00:37:16,018
Yeah, Gerald.

839
00:37:16,043 --> 00:37:17,177
We swear it.

840
00:37:18,887 --> 00:37:19,938
That's right.

841
00:37:20,263 --> 00:37:21,661
Shimmy on over here.

842
00:37:22,107 --> 00:37:23,907
Come on. You can do it.

843
00:37:24,560 --> 00:37:25,640
That's right.

844
00:37:25,811 --> 00:37:27,271
Mind you don't scuff your bum.

845
00:37:30,065 --> 00:37:32,815
Thank you so much, Gerald.

846
00:37:32,985 --> 00:37:35,605
Welcome to your time on this rock.

847
00:37:37,155 --> 00:37:38,775
Comfortable, isn't it?

848
00:37:39,908 --> 00:37:41,358
Time's up! Now get off, Gerald!

849
00:37:43,120 --> 00:37:44,368
No this is nuts!

850
00:37:44,593 --> 00:37:47,035
Why do I keep getting
talked into insane choices?

851
00:37:47,833 --> 00:37:48,883
Good luck!

852
00:37:53,672 --> 00:37:55,302
Ok, when I tell you you're gonna...

853
00:37:55,326 --> 00:37:57,385
Yeah. I know.
I'm gonna signal with a big splash.

854
00:37:57,609 --> 00:37:58,680
On my mark.

855
00:37:59,005 --> 00:38:00,162
Not clear yet.

856
00:38:00,487 --> 00:38:01,847
Not clear yet.

857
00:38:02,556 --> 00:38:04,806
Now?
Not 'til Destiny gives the signal.

858
00:38:06,351 --> 00:38:07,395
Do you know something?

859
00:38:07,620 --> 00:38:09,705
I have no idea why you're even doing this.

860
00:38:10,606 --> 00:38:11,436
What do you mean?

861
00:38:11,607 --> 00:38:13,585
It seems like a lot of trouble
just to find some more fish.

862
00:38:13,809 --> 00:38:15,339
If I had short-term memory loss,

863
00:38:15,363 --> 00:38:17,589
I'd just swim off into
the blue and forget everything.

864
00:38:17,590 --> 00:38:19,424
Well I don't want to do that.
I want my family.

865
00:38:19,448 --> 00:38:21,588
Not me, kid. I don't want anyone
to worry about.

866
00:38:22,034 --> 00:38:23,034
You're lucky.

867
00:38:23,058 --> 00:38:24,260
No memories.

868
00:38:24,485 --> 00:38:25,902
No problems.

869
00:38:26,621 --> 00:38:28,741
No memories. No problems.

870
00:38:29,291 --> 00:38:32,541
Still not clear. Still not clear.

871
00:38:32,911 --> 00:38:34,388
You don't have to say when it's not time.

872
00:38:34,412 --> 00:38:35,490
Just tell me when it is time.

873
00:38:35,514 --> 00:38:36,510
Ok, here we go.

874
00:38:36,735 --> 00:38:37,598
And... Wait!

875
00:38:37,732 --> 00:38:39,202
Here we go. Wait.
Are you serious?

876
00:38:39,226 --> 00:38:41,195
Ok, on the count of three.
Don't count. Just say, Go.

877
00:38:41,219 --> 00:38:42,237
Go! Now, now.

878
00:38:42,238 --> 00:38:43,563
Do it! Do it!
What? Ok, Ok.

879
00:38:44,255 --> 00:38:45,745
Look at that! I mean...
That's the signal.

880
00:38:45,769 --> 00:38:47,194
Go, go, go! That's the signal!

881
00:38:52,814 --> 00:38:54,508
Now remember Destiny said,

882
00:38:54,533 --> 00:38:57,320
follow the signs
to the Open Ocean exhibit.

883
00:38:57,886 --> 00:39:00,686
I can't see squat,
so it's your job to look for it.

884
00:39:00,710 --> 00:39:02,986
Got it. Follow the signs to Open Ocean.

885
00:39:03,158 --> 00:39:04,844
I'm just gonna repeat it, Ok?
That should work.

886
00:39:04,868 --> 00:39:07,368
Follow the signs to Open Ocean.
Follow the signs to Open Ocean.

887
00:39:07,496 --> 00:39:10,576
Go right! Follow the signs to Open Ocean.

888
00:39:10,749 --> 00:39:14,169
Follow the signs to Open Ocean.
Follow the signs to Open Ocean. Left!

889
00:39:14,336 --> 00:39:16,397
Follow the signs to Open Ocean.
And steer clear of people, will you?

890
00:39:16,421 --> 00:39:17,393
Especially kids.

891
00:39:17,518 --> 00:39:18,615
I don't want to be touched.

892
00:39:18,973 --> 00:39:20,523
Do not mess me up!

893
00:39:22,844 --> 00:39:23,765
Oh, poor baby.

894
00:39:23,790 --> 00:39:25,588
Let me get that for you.
Here you...

895
00:39:27,766 --> 00:39:28,846
Oh my...

896
00:39:29,935 --> 00:39:30,803
Where do we go?

897
00:39:30,828 --> 00:39:31,869
Where do we go?

898
00:39:31,920 --> 00:39:32,740
Oh, sorry!

899
00:39:32,765 --> 00:39:34,924
Ok, I was looking, looking...

900
00:39:35,865 --> 00:39:37,915
Becky! Drop us anywhere.
We're Ok.

901
00:39:37,943 --> 00:39:38,963
Just wait, Dad.

902
00:39:38,964 --> 00:39:41,097
I think she's looking for a place to land.

903
00:39:41,121 --> 00:39:42,361
She's confused, Nemo.

904
00:39:42,386 --> 00:39:44,432
She doesn't even know which way to look.

905
00:39:51,173 --> 00:39:53,693
Wait, wait, wait Becky. Becky!
What are you doing?

906
00:39:56,962 --> 00:39:59,040
Ok. I was going somewhere.

907
00:39:59,265 --> 00:40:00,506
The question is where.

908
00:40:00,530 --> 00:40:02,119
Which way?
Do you see the sign?

909
00:40:02,384 --> 00:40:05,204
I'm looking. I'm looking. Something
to something gets me to my family.

910
00:40:05,428 --> 00:40:06,428
My family!

911
00:40:06,452 --> 00:40:08,452
The world's most powerfull...

912
00:40:08,640 --> 00:40:10,118
I know that. Why do I know that?

913
00:40:10,443 --> 00:40:11,764
It's another memory.

914
00:40:11,810 --> 00:40:12,999
Hank, we need to go that way!

915
00:40:13,023 --> 00:40:14,464
Left. Go, go left.

916
00:40:18,467 --> 00:40:19,367
Becky!

917
00:40:21,086 --> 00:40:23,136
She can't hear you, Dad.

918
00:40:23,263 --> 00:40:24,091
All right. All right. All right.

919
00:40:24,358 --> 00:40:25,085
New plan.

920
00:40:25,210 --> 00:40:27,391
We have to get closer
to Becky so she can hear us.

921
00:40:28,243 --> 00:40:29,883
I don't think we should move the pail.

922
00:40:30,704 --> 00:40:31,592
Nemo.

923
00:40:32,617 --> 00:40:34,179
Without me Becky's lost.

924
00:40:34,749 --> 00:40:36,898
Dad, just trust her.
Trust her?

925
00:40:37,723 --> 00:40:39,586
So she can forget us all together?

926
00:40:39,629 --> 00:40:40,506
I trust Becky.

927
00:40:40,530 --> 00:40:43,082
You trust Becky.
Becky is eating a cup!

928
00:40:45,260 --> 00:40:46,600
Becky! Becky!

929
00:40:56,514 --> 00:40:57,044
Well,

930
00:40:57,569 --> 00:40:59,658
at least we're not stuck
in the bucket any more.

931
00:41:04,321 --> 00:41:05,951
Or on top of quarantine.

932
00:41:06,240 --> 00:41:08,800
The baby otter talk is beginning now.

933
00:41:08,867 --> 00:41:10,789
Why, thanks, Sigourney Weaver.

934
00:41:10,814 --> 00:41:13,311
Hey, who wants to learn about otters?

935
00:41:14,539 --> 00:41:16,789
Looking for the world's
most powerful pair of glasses.

936
00:41:17,125 --> 00:41:18,185
Otters!

937
00:41:18,460 --> 00:41:20,220
Welcome, it's a huge cuddle party!

938
00:41:20,844 --> 00:41:22,596
Cuddle party! I'm in!

939
00:41:22,797 --> 00:41:25,267
Where are we?
Are we close to Open Ocean?

940
00:41:25,434 --> 00:41:26,632
Yes. I think. Well, I don't know.

941
00:41:26,757 --> 00:41:27,978
But I saw that other sign so...

942
00:41:28,178 --> 00:41:29,178
What? What other sign?

943
00:41:29,202 --> 00:41:30,581
The world's most powerful pair of glasses.

944
00:41:30,605 --> 00:41:32,232
What? What are you talking about?

945
00:41:32,257 --> 00:41:33,739
Why would we follow that sign?

946
00:41:33,842 --> 00:41:35,652
Well, because I remembered it.

947
00:41:35,676 --> 00:41:37,027
Non, no, no. That wasn't the plan.

948
00:41:39,814 --> 00:41:41,119
All right, that's it!

949
00:41:41,144 --> 00:41:42,558
You have wasted my time!

950
00:41:42,582 --> 00:41:43,161
Wait. No.

951
00:41:43,186 --> 00:41:44,844
That transport truck leaves at dawn,

952
00:41:44,869 --> 00:41:46,884
and I'm not missing it, so give me your tag.

953
00:41:46,908 --> 00:41:48,490
No! No, I remembered that sign.

954
00:41:48,657 --> 00:41:50,537
So?
So I'm remembering more and more

955
00:41:50,561 --> 00:41:52,726
and I feel like my memory's getting better.
I think we should...

956
00:41:52,727 --> 00:41:55,497
No! Your memory is not working.
You can't remember anything.

957
00:41:55,664 --> 00:41:58,334
It's probably how you lost your family
in the first place!

958
00:42:01,211 --> 00:42:03,598
All right, look,
let's just take it down a notch.

959
00:42:04,023 --> 00:42:05,215
Just give me the tag and...

960
00:42:05,257 --> 00:42:06,058
You know something,

961
00:42:06,083 --> 00:42:08,231
for a guy with three hearts
you're not very nice.

962
00:42:08,255 --> 00:42:09,794
Three hearts?
What are you talking about?

963
00:42:09,919 --> 00:42:10,947
I don't have three hearts.

964
00:42:10,971 --> 00:42:11,941
Yes, you do.
I don't!

965
00:42:12,222 --> 00:42:13,012
You do!
Don't!

966
00:42:13,036 --> 00:42:14,036
Do!
Stop saying that!

967
00:42:14,060 --> 00:42:17,262
Fun fact-the octopus has three hearts.

968
00:42:17,644 --> 00:42:18,790
Two pump blood to the gills,

969
00:42:18,815 --> 00:42:20,674
while the third pumps blood
throughout the body.

970
00:42:25,360 --> 00:42:27,296
You know, someone with three hearts
shouldn't be so mean.

971
00:42:27,320 --> 00:42:29,680
And it's mean to say that
I would lose someone I love!

972
00:42:30,991 --> 00:42:32,666
I did not lose them!

973
00:42:33,491 --> 00:42:34,215
Hank?

974
00:42:35,620 --> 00:42:36,620
Hank?

975
00:42:37,440 --> 00:42:38,440
Hank?

976
00:42:38,790 --> 00:42:41,810
Han-s.
No. Not Hans. I'm looking for Hank.

977
00:42:41,876 --> 00:42:43,946
Han-s.
Hank. With a k. Hank.

978
00:42:44,212 --> 00:42:45,869
Hands!
Hands?

979
00:42:50,427 --> 00:42:52,007
Hank! Hank?

980
00:42:53,138 --> 00:42:54,138
My arm!

981
00:42:54,180 --> 00:42:54,880
Hank!

982
00:42:57,892 --> 00:42:59,092
Where are you? Hank!

983
00:43:00,577 --> 00:43:02,287
Can you please help me?
I'm looking for...

984
00:43:04,566 --> 00:43:06,095
Please help me.
I've lost my friend Frank.

985
00:43:06,120 --> 00:43:06,877
I'm sorry, not Frank.

986
00:43:06,901 --> 00:43:07,991
You're in my space!

987
00:43:08,653 --> 00:43:09,683
He's an octopus.

988
00:43:09,808 --> 00:43:11,377
No, septo... Septopus.
That's right.

989
00:43:11,414 --> 00:43:12,704
He's a septopus. Septopus.

990
00:43:14,284 --> 00:43:16,385
One, two, three, four, five, six, s...
Septopus!

991
00:43:16,510 --> 00:43:17,518
He's camouflaged!

992
00:43:20,415 --> 00:43:21,638
Hank. Come on, Hank!

993
00:43:21,863 --> 00:43:22,889
Let's get out of here.

994
00:43:23,134 --> 00:43:24,524
Dory, what are you doing?

995
00:43:24,919 --> 00:43:25,764
Hank!

996
00:43:27,089 --> 00:43:28,323
What's the plan?

997
00:43:28,465 --> 00:43:30,585
The plan is I'm gonna stay here forever.

998
00:43:30,759 --> 00:43:31,949
Ok. Good plan.

999
00:43:34,045 --> 00:43:34,868
I'm sorry.

1000
00:43:35,093 --> 00:43:37,260
I'm sorry, Hank. I'm sorry.
I can't remember right.

1001
00:43:38,391 --> 00:43:40,391
Sweetie. Sweetie.
Watch out, kelpcake.

1002
00:43:40,518 --> 00:43:41,768
Watch where you're going.

1003
00:43:42,645 --> 00:43:44,061
I'm sorry, Daddy.

1004
00:43:44,486 --> 00:43:46,799
I'm sorry I can't remember right.

1005
00:43:47,108 --> 00:43:51,608
Sweetie. Sweetie,
you don't need to be sorry.

1006
00:43:51,880 --> 00:43:53,644
You know what you need to do?

1007
00:43:54,369 --> 00:43:55,424
Just keep swimming.

1008
00:43:56,367 --> 00:43:57,367
Yeah.

1009
00:43:57,535 --> 00:43:59,661
I bet you can remember that because,

1010
00:43:59,886 --> 00:44:01,479
we're just...

1011
00:44:02,207 --> 00:44:03,627
We're gonna sing a song about it.

1012
00:44:04,092 --> 00:44:06,732

1013

1017
00:44:20,616 --> 00:44:21,936
My parents taught me that song!

1018
00:44:22,018 --> 00:44:23,388
We sang it as a family.

1019
00:44:23,561 --> 00:44:25,041
All this time I thought I made it up!

1020
00:44:25,146 --> 00:44:26,816
What song?
Just keep swimming.

1021
00:44:26,981 --> 00:44:28,981
Hank, we've just got to keep swimming.

1022
00:44:29,150 --> 00:44:32,350
What? No way! Listen to me,
it's too dangerous to move.

1023
00:44:32,374 --> 00:44:33,326
No, you listen to me.

1024
00:44:33,451 --> 00:44:35,334
I know you're scared,
but you can't give up.

1025
00:44:35,532 --> 00:44:36,572

I'm coming, Mommy.
I'm coming, Daddy!

1031
00:44:50,338 --> 00:44:52,008
We're gonna be Ok.
Stop!

1032
00:44:52,173 --> 00:44:53,453
Turn back.

1033
00:44:53,675 --> 00:44:54,875
Turn back!

1034
00:44:55,051 --> 00:44:57,931
You're headed right for Poker's Cove.

1035
00:44:58,012 --> 00:44:59,892
Poker's Cove.

1036
00:45:00,598 --> 00:45:02,628
Poker's Cove?
Incoming!

1037
00:45:05,854 --> 00:45:07,364
Stop it!

1038
00:45:07,522 --> 00:45:09,022
Oh, what is this?

1039
00:45:13,194 --> 00:45:14,034
Sorry.

1040
00:45:14,195 --> 00:45:16,525
That's Ok. Everybody does it.
Nothing to be ashamed of.

1041
00:45:21,703 --> 00:45:22,393
Hank?

1042
00:45:23,018 --> 00:45:24,487
Hank. There you are.

1043
00:45:26,390 --> 00:45:28,090
You got us out of there.

1044
00:45:29,659 --> 00:45:30,729
I did.

1045
00:45:32,338 --> 00:45:33,628
I got us out of there.

1046
00:45:33,791 --> 00:45:35,751
I mean, technically you also got us in there.

1047
00:45:36,759 --> 00:45:39,129
But if you hadn't I'm not sure
we would have gotten...

1048
00:45:39,653 --> 00:45:40,653
here.

1049
00:45:42,473 --> 00:45:45,443
Echolocation. Echolocation!

1050
00:45:45,602 --> 00:45:48,522
The world's most powerful pair
of glasses. We found it!

1051
00:45:48,546 --> 00:45:49,146
No. No. No.

1052
00:45:49,647 --> 00:45:51,267
You found that.

1053
00:45:56,779 --> 00:45:59,409
Welcome to the Open Ocean.

1054
00:46:00,408 --> 00:46:01,488
Home.

1055
00:46:10,402 --> 00:46:12,572
Dad, stop. She's not coming back.

1056
00:46:12,637 --> 00:46:13,697
She might.

1057
00:46:14,380 --> 00:46:16,510
Dad! You made her feel like
she couldn't do it.

1058
00:46:23,598 --> 00:46:25,598
You're not talking about Becky, are you?

1059
00:46:27,936 --> 00:46:29,306
I miss Dory.

1060
00:46:29,938 --> 00:46:31,188
Me too.

1061
00:46:35,610 --> 00:46:38,200
The truth is, I'm just so worried about her.

1062
00:46:38,947 --> 00:46:40,777
She's the one who should be worried about us.

1063
00:46:41,449 --> 00:46:44,449
Well, she would definitely have an idea
of what to do if she were here.

1064
00:46:45,370 --> 00:46:46,790
I don't know how she does that.

1065
00:46:46,955 --> 00:46:48,494
I don't think she knows, Dad.

1066
00:46:49,019 --> 00:46:50,609
She just does.

1067
00:46:51,259 --> 00:46:53,729
Well, then we'll just have to think.

1068
00:46:54,963 --> 00:46:57,303
What would Dory do?
What would Dory do?

1069
00:46:57,465 --> 00:46:59,375
Yeah! What would Dory do?

1070
00:47:00,051 --> 00:47:01,722
She would assess her situation,

1071
00:47:01,847 --> 00:47:04,722
and then she'd evaluate and
she would analyse her options.

1072
00:47:04,889 --> 00:47:07,179
Dad, that's what would Marlin do.

1073
00:47:07,203 --> 00:47:10,000
Right, that's what I would do.
She wouldn't even think twice.

1074
00:47:10,144 --> 00:47:12,264
She would just look at the first thing
she sees and...

1075
00:47:24,993 --> 00:47:26,163
Dory would do it.

1076
00:47:29,872 --> 00:47:31,082
Nemo, hold on to me.

1077
00:47:37,005 --> 00:47:38,205
Hey, it's working!

1078
00:47:43,970 --> 00:47:47,680
Just keep gasping.

1079
00:47:53,688 --> 00:47:55,016
Are you Ok?
Yeah!

1080
00:47:55,141 --> 00:47:56,252
What would Dory do now?

1081
00:47:56,399 --> 00:47:57,439
Who's Dory?

1082
00:47:58,735 --> 00:48:00,755
Oh boy. Are we happy to see you.

1083
00:48:00,779 --> 00:48:03,275
Happy to see me?
I'm happy to see you!

1084
00:48:03,448 --> 00:48:06,078
I haven't had anyone to talk to in years.

1085
00:48:06,242 --> 00:48:07,242
Years?

1086
00:48:07,994 --> 00:48:10,164
Unfortunately we can't stay long.
We have to go because...

1087
00:48:10,188 --> 00:48:11,811
Now why would you want to go?

1088
00:48:11,936 --> 00:48:12,942
You just landed.

1089
00:48:13,082 --> 00:48:14,167
Stay a while.

1090
00:48:14,292 --> 00:48:15,942
Tell me all about yourself.

1091
00:48:15,966 --> 00:48:18,820
Well, I would love to, but my son and
I have to get to quarantine, so...

1092
00:48:18,988 --> 00:48:21,028
Wonderful thing to have a son.
Yeah it is.

1093
00:48:21,199 --> 00:48:22,432
Well I don't have a family.

1094
00:48:22,557 --> 00:48:24,213
I dated a nice scallop for a while.

1095
00:48:24,552 --> 00:48:26,230
That's fascinating, but...
But scallops have eyes.

1096
00:48:26,254 --> 00:48:28,641
And she was looking for something
different. I'm kidding!

1097
00:48:28,665 --> 00:48:30,725
Well, not about scallops having eyes.
They do.

1098
00:48:30,892 --> 00:48:33,142
And they see into your soul
and they break your heart.

1099
00:48:33,911 --> 00:48:34,871
Shelley!

1100
00:48:35,196 --> 00:48:36,370
Why?

1101
00:48:37,815 --> 00:48:39,145
Now what would Dory do?

1102
00:48:40,485 --> 00:48:41,675
Come with us,

1103
00:48:41,699 --> 00:48:45,907
as we explore the mysterious
world of the Open Ocean.

1104
00:48:47,617 --> 00:48:48,912
Ok, Hank, follow me.

1105
00:48:49,137 --> 00:48:50,201
You're in a cup.

1106
00:48:50,244 --> 00:48:51,464
Right. I'll follow you then.

1107
00:49:03,400 --> 00:49:04,300
Wait.

1108
00:49:04,925 --> 00:49:07,125
An octopus has three hearts.

1109
00:49:08,137 --> 00:49:09,207
That's a fun fact.

1110
00:49:20,149 --> 00:49:21,149
We're here.

1111
00:49:21,173 --> 00:49:22,873
This is. This is really happening.

1112
00:49:33,663 --> 00:49:35,588
Well, looks like this is it, kid.

1113
00:49:35,813 --> 00:49:37,697
Now I got a truck to catch.
Wait.

1114
00:49:37,733 --> 00:49:39,873
Wait! I had something for you.

1115
00:49:42,171 --> 00:49:42,996
Tag.

1116
00:49:43,421 --> 00:49:45,095
The tag. Right!

1117
00:49:52,348 --> 00:49:53,171
You know,

1118
00:49:53,896 --> 00:49:55,663
I think I'm gonna remember you.

1119
00:49:58,312 --> 00:50:00,482
You'll forget me in a heartbeat, kid.

1120
00:50:00,982 --> 00:50:02,132
Three heartbeats.

1121
00:50:03,568 --> 00:50:05,288
I'll have a hard time forgetting you though.

1122
00:50:10,658 --> 00:50:12,368
My parents are actually down there.

1123
00:50:18,040 --> 00:50:19,070
You Ok?

1124
00:50:20,668 --> 00:50:21,668
I'm ready.

1125
00:50:22,336 --> 00:50:23,044
Yeah.

1126
00:50:24,169 --> 00:50:25,291
I think you are.

1127
00:50:36,225 --> 00:50:38,345
Where are they? Where are they?
Where are they?

1128
00:50:45,727 --> 00:50:46,810
Pardon me.

1129
00:50:48,335 --> 00:50:51,082
Hi. Have you seen a mom
and a dad without me?

1130
00:50:51,324 --> 00:50:53,084
Excuse me. Have you seen a couple?

1131
00:50:53,159 --> 00:50:54,169
They're old like you.

1132
00:50:54,193 --> 00:50:56,875
Not old like you, but older than you even.

1133
00:50:57,163 --> 00:50:58,163
Ok. Bye.

1134
00:50:58,372 --> 00:51:00,834
Hi. Do you know anyone who lost a kid,

1135
00:51:00,859 --> 00:51:03,366
a long time ago, that would be me.

1136
00:51:03,611 --> 00:51:05,200
I don't know how long ago exact...

1137
00:51:05,425 --> 00:51:06,465
Ok. You're in a hurry.

1138
00:51:06,964 --> 00:51:08,684
Ho, ho! Watch where you're going.
Oh sorry.

1139
00:51:16,182 --> 00:51:19,772
It's our goal, that every
animal we rescue and care for...

1140
00:51:19,936 --> 00:51:22,396
will eventually return home
to where they belong.

1141
00:51:27,401 --> 00:51:28,571
Shells.

1142
00:51:28,736 --> 00:51:32,696
And there we go.
Now, if you ever get lost, Dory.

1143
00:51:32,865 --> 00:51:34,615
You just follow the shells.

1144
00:51:34,784 --> 00:51:36,144
Hey, look! Shells!

1145
00:51:43,918 --> 00:51:45,378
Follow the shells.

1146
00:51:57,765 --> 00:52:00,555
Hey, I live there.
Yes, yes indeed.

1147
00:52:01,844 --> 00:52:03,964
My home. That's my home!

1148
00:52:05,439 --> 00:52:07,229
Mom! Dad!

1149
00:52:08,776 --> 00:52:11,446
Ok, kelpcake. Now count to ten.

1150
00:52:12,321 --> 00:52:14,951
One, two, three...

1151
00:52:15,616 --> 00:52:17,196
Four...

1152
00:52:17,785 --> 00:52:20,115
You're welcome.

1153
00:52:20,287 --> 00:52:21,997
Who are you talking to, kelpcake?

1154
00:52:22,164 --> 00:52:23,824
My pipe pal, Destiny!

1155
00:52:28,295 --> 00:52:30,795
Mom? Dad?

1156
00:52:39,974 --> 00:52:41,684
Mommy loves purple shells.

1157
00:52:49,775 --> 00:52:53,315
Mommy?
What's going to happen to her?

1158
00:52:53,487 --> 00:52:55,237
There, there, Jenny.

1159
00:52:55,823 --> 00:52:58,413
Oh no, don't cry, Mommy. Don't cry.

1160
00:52:58,492 --> 00:53:01,582
Do you think she's... That she can
make it on her own, Charlie?

1161
00:53:01,662 --> 00:53:04,622
Oh, honey. It'll be Ok.

1162
00:53:07,334 --> 00:53:09,174
Mommy loves purple shells.

1163
00:53:19,680 --> 00:53:20,970
Dory!
Dory?

1164
00:53:21,140 --> 00:53:22,730
Dory!
Mommy?

1165
00:53:23,976 --> 00:53:26,806
Dory!
Mommy! Daddy!

1166
00:53:29,982 --> 00:53:31,102
My parents...

1167
00:53:33,793 --> 00:53:35,003
I lost them.

1168
00:53:43,370 --> 00:53:44,610
It was my fault.

1169
00:53:46,107 --> 00:53:47,177
Where's your tag?

1170
00:53:48,042 --> 00:53:48,992
Your tag.

1171
00:53:49,017 --> 00:53:49,773
It's missing.

1172
00:53:50,198 --> 00:53:51,690
That why you're not in quarantine?

1173
00:53:51,962 --> 00:53:53,032
Quarantine?
Yeah!

1174
00:53:53,255 --> 00:53:55,057
That's where they took all the blue tangs.

1175
00:53:55,282 --> 00:53:56,399
Isn't that right, Bill?

1176
00:53:56,550 --> 00:53:59,450
Yep. The blue tangs are getting
their own exhibit in Cleveland.

1177
00:53:59,720 --> 00:54:01,598
Being shipped out on a truck
at the crack of dawn.

1178
00:54:01,923 --> 00:54:02,915
Must be nice.
What?

1179
00:54:03,015 --> 00:54:05,345
No! No, my parents are back in quarantine?

1180
00:54:05,369 --> 00:54:08,268
They're being shipped to Cleveland?
But I just, I just got here!

1181
00:54:08,437 --> 00:54:10,248
I, I've got to get to them.
They don't know I'm here.

1182
00:54:10,272 --> 00:54:12,432
Don't worry, it's easy to get to quarantine.

1183
00:54:12,456 --> 00:54:14,070
You can just go through the pipes, honey.

1184
00:54:18,604 --> 00:54:19,894
I can't do that.

1185
00:54:20,099 --> 00:54:20,824
Why not?

1186
00:54:21,249 --> 00:54:22,523
I'll forget where I'm going.

1187
00:54:22,868 --> 00:54:26,038
And I, and I can't be somewhere
where I have nobody to help me.

1188
00:54:26,205 --> 00:54:27,709
Well, then I guess you're stuck here.

1189
00:54:27,733 --> 00:54:28,999
You're not helping, Bill.

1190
00:54:29,250 --> 00:54:31,550
Just go in there if you want to.
You'll be fine.

1191
00:54:35,673 --> 00:54:36,683
Oh boy.

1192
00:54:37,366 --> 00:54:39,791
Could you...
Could you tell me how to get there?

1193
00:54:40,216 --> 00:54:41,310
Through the pipes?

1194
00:54:41,554 --> 00:54:42,557
Sure, honey.

1195
00:54:42,582 --> 00:54:44,437
It's two lefts and then a right.

1196
00:54:44,861 --> 00:54:45,612
Simple.

1197
00:54:49,562 --> 00:54:51,062
Ok.

1198
00:54:53,274 --> 00:54:55,944
Two lefts and a right. I can do this.

1199
00:54:56,110 --> 00:54:58,950
Two lefts and a right. Ok.
Don't forget.

1200
00:55:04,785 --> 00:55:06,745
Two lefts and a right.
Two lefts and a right.

1201
00:55:07,830 --> 00:55:09,970
Two lefts and a right.
Two lefts and a right.

1202
00:55:10,495 --> 00:55:11,814
Two lefts and a right.

1203
00:55:13,669 --> 00:55:17,629
Two lefts and a right? Shoot.

1204
00:55:18,841 --> 00:55:19,948
Left and a right.

1205
00:55:20,173 --> 00:55:22,485
Wait. Did I already take a left?

1206
00:55:22,587 --> 00:55:23,487
Oh no.

1207
00:55:23,707 --> 00:55:24,587
It's happening.

1208
00:55:24,912 --> 00:55:25,633
Ok, hold on.

1209
00:55:25,858 --> 00:55:27,139
Hold on, hold on, hold on.

1210
00:55:27,191 --> 00:55:28,071
Which way?

1211
00:55:28,396 --> 00:55:29,645
Where am I going?

1212
00:55:29,870 --> 00:55:31,059
I can't remember. Ok.

1213
00:55:31,478 --> 00:55:33,123
Ok. I'm lost. It's too hard.
I can't remember.

1214
00:55:33,147 --> 00:55:34,317
I'm forgetting everything.

1215
00:55:34,481 --> 00:55:36,831
I'm gonna be stuck forever in the pipes.

1216
00:55:36,856 --> 00:55:38,245
The pipes! The pipe pals.

1217
00:55:38,444 --> 00:55:40,494
Pipe pals? Pipe pals!

1218
00:55:41,155 --> 00:55:43,396
And... swim, swim, swim.

1219
00:55:43,397 --> 00:55:44,819
Yeah, I don't know about this.

1220
00:55:44,843 --> 00:55:47,037
Trust me, I won't let you hit anything.
Wall!

1221
00:55:48,454 --> 00:55:50,374
What's the point?
I'll never learn to get around!

1222
00:55:50,456 --> 00:55:53,268
You better! If you can't do it in here
you'll never do it out in the ocean.

1223
00:55:53,292 --> 00:55:55,542
Now really focus, Ok? Wall!

1224
00:55:55,711 --> 00:55:57,211
Destiny!

1225
00:55:57,379 --> 00:55:59,169
Dory? Hello?

1226
00:55:59,340 --> 00:56:03,050
I'm lost in the pipes
and my parents are in quarantine!

1227
00:56:03,219 --> 00:56:06,559
Hang on, Dory! Bailey!
You've got to use your echolocation!

1228
00:56:06,722 --> 00:56:07,562
You know it's broken!

1229
00:56:07,723 --> 00:56:09,985
Just stop it, and try the Ooh thing
Dory talked about, will you?

1230
00:56:10,009 --> 00:56:12,209
But I don't think I can...
Don't bail on me, Bailey!

1231
00:56:18,526 --> 00:56:19,288
Come on, Bailey.

1232
00:56:19,313 --> 00:56:20,313
What did you just tell me?

1233
00:56:20,757 --> 00:56:21,674
Really focus!

1234
00:56:22,196 --> 00:56:23,196
I feel stupid.

1235
00:56:23,220 --> 00:56:24,293
Bailey.
Sorry.

1236
00:56:26,033 --> 00:56:27,093
Hello?
Here!

1237
00:56:27,576 --> 00:56:28,836
We're here!

1238
00:56:29,703 --> 00:56:30,411
Guys!

1239
00:56:30,636 --> 00:56:33,058
Guys!
What? What? What is it?

1240
00:56:33,415 --> 00:56:34,115
I'm getting something!

1241
00:56:34,494 --> 00:56:35,284
Here we go!

1242
00:56:35,709 --> 00:56:36,573
Oh yes!

1243
00:56:37,854 --> 00:56:39,355
I can see the quarantine!

1244
00:56:40,280 --> 00:56:41,808
This is amazing!

1245
00:56:43,608 --> 00:56:44,836
I can see everything!

1246
00:56:44,961 --> 00:56:46,168
And I can see you!

1247
00:56:46,353 --> 00:56:47,953
He can see you!

1248
00:56:47,977 --> 00:56:49,181
My life's a rainbow!

1249
00:56:49,406 --> 00:56:50,258
Can you see me?

1250
00:56:50,916 --> 00:56:52,496
Right, it doesn't work that way.

1251
00:56:52,520 --> 00:56:54,698
Bailey!
Ok! Tell Dory to go left!

1252
00:56:54,722 --> 00:56:56,142
He says go left!

1253
00:56:56,605 --> 00:56:57,775
Left?

1254
00:57:00,108 --> 00:57:01,118
Straight!
Straight!

1255
00:57:01,902 --> 00:57:02,630
Straight!

1256
00:57:03,055 --> 00:57:03,666
Go right!

1257
00:57:03,790 --> 00:57:05,174
Right!

1258
00:57:06,407 --> 00:57:07,407
I'm light-headed!

1259
00:57:08,079 --> 00:57:08,871
Wait.

1260
00:57:09,618 --> 00:57:11,508
I'm picking up something else.
Hold on! Let me zoom out.

1261
00:57:13,747 --> 00:57:15,867
Holy Neptune, she's not alone!
What?

1262
00:57:15,958 --> 00:57:17,878
What is it?
I can't tell! But it's coming for her.

1263
00:57:17,902 --> 00:57:18,666
Oh no!

1264
00:57:18,891 --> 00:57:20,341
Dory, swim!

1265
00:57:20,342 --> 00:57:21,606
Swim the other way!

1266
00:57:21,922 --> 00:57:23,342
What? Where?
What? Where?

1267
00:57:23,465 --> 00:57:24,705
Go right!
Right!

1268
00:57:26,811 --> 00:57:27,616
No, my right!

1269
00:57:27,641 --> 00:57:29,455
Oh no! She's heading right towards it!

1270
00:57:29,596 --> 00:57:31,126
No! Dory, turn around!

1271
00:57:33,267 --> 00:57:35,667
That's great, Dory!
You're headed right toward us!

1272
00:57:35,936 --> 00:57:37,596
What? You want me to go right?
No!

1273
00:57:37,730 --> 00:57:39,190
No! Not right. Oh, I can't look!

1274
00:57:43,444 --> 00:57:44,654
Dory!
Marlin?

1275
00:57:45,070 --> 00:57:46,589
I knew it! You're Ok!
Oh my gosh!

1276
00:57:47,013 --> 00:57:50,453
It's consuming her!
It's eating her alive!

1277
00:57:51,077 --> 00:57:52,077
Dory!

1278
00:57:52,119 --> 00:57:54,419
You're Ok!
You found me! How did you find me?

1279
00:57:54,443 --> 00:57:56,858
There was a crazy clam.
He wouldn't stop talking.

1280
00:57:57,124 --> 00:58:00,294
We just slowly backed away from him
and into these pipes.

1281
00:58:00,461 --> 00:58:01,961
And then we just started looking.

1282
00:58:02,129 --> 00:58:04,799
Dory! I'm sorry!

1283
00:58:05,165 --> 00:58:06,465
Ok, what was that?

1284
00:58:06,633 --> 00:58:07,773
Hang on. I got to take this.

1285
00:58:08,135 --> 00:58:10,845
It's Ok! Sorry for what?

1286
00:58:10,971 --> 00:58:12,671
What? You're Ok?

1287
00:58:12,695 --> 00:58:14,840
Yes!
I found Marlin and Nemo!

1288
00:58:15,809 --> 00:58:18,419
Dad! Did you hear that?
Dory really does speak whale.

1289
00:58:18,487 --> 00:58:19,567
I heard it.

1290
00:58:19,655 --> 00:58:22,395
It's bringing back some very bad
memories so let's get out of here.

1291
00:58:22,608 --> 00:58:24,547
I say we go this way.

1292
00:58:24,648 --> 00:58:26,472
Follow me. It's time to head home!

1293
00:58:26,987 --> 00:58:27,987
Wait, wait, wait!

1294
00:58:28,803 --> 00:58:30,131
My parents are here.

1295
00:58:30,532 --> 00:58:32,132
They are?
You found your parents?

1296
00:58:32,156 --> 00:58:33,342
Well, not exactly.

1297
00:58:33,367 --> 00:58:35,258
No. I mean not yet, but...

1298
00:58:35,482 --> 00:58:36,781
I know where they are,

1299
00:58:36,997 --> 00:58:39,466
and I know exactly how to get there,

1300
00:58:39,467 --> 00:58:41,211
but I know that, well I'm getting help...

1301
00:58:41,235 --> 00:58:43,170
Down to quarantine.
Quarantine.

1302
00:58:43,337 --> 00:58:44,255
That's it!

1303
00:58:44,680 --> 00:58:47,132
And I met this septopus, super cranky but,

1304
00:58:47,174 --> 00:58:49,732
secretly kind of sweet,
and he got me into the exhibit...

1305
00:58:50,957 --> 00:58:52,209
The exhibit.

1306
00:58:54,681 --> 00:58:55,681
Dory?

1307
00:58:56,517 --> 00:58:58,487
Do you think my parents will want to see me?

1308
00:58:58,852 --> 00:59:00,992
What? Why wouldn't they want to see you?

1309
00:59:02,022 --> 00:59:03,022
Because...

1310
00:59:03,925 --> 00:59:05,216
I lost them.

1311
00:59:06,193 --> 00:59:07,186
Dory,

1312
00:59:07,211 --> 00:59:10,188
your parents are going
to be overjoyed to see you.

1313
00:59:10,989 --> 00:59:13,729
They're going to have missed,
everything about you.

1314
00:59:14,001 --> 00:59:14,586
Really?

1315
00:59:14,611 --> 00:59:16,365
Dory, do you know how we found you?

1316
00:59:16,389 --> 00:59:18,243
Something about a clam or...
No.

1317
00:59:18,267 --> 00:59:19,435
No, an oyster.
No.

1318
00:59:19,706 --> 00:59:20,706
Mollusc?
No.

1319
00:59:20,770 --> 00:59:22,900
Something, I don't. No?
No clam.

1320
00:59:22,924 --> 00:59:25,878
We were having a very hard
time until Nemo thought...

1321
00:59:26,046 --> 00:59:27,746
What would Dory do?

1322
00:59:28,632 --> 00:59:29,882
Why would you say that?

1323
00:59:30,050 --> 00:59:33,050
Because ever since I've met you,
you've shown me how to do...

1324
00:59:33,220 --> 00:59:35,057
stuff I never dreamed of doing.

1325
00:59:35,982 --> 00:59:37,354
Crazy things!

1326
00:59:38,267 --> 00:59:41,667
Outsmarting sharks and jumping jellyfish.

1327
00:59:42,938 --> 00:59:44,710
And finding my son.

1328
00:59:45,535 --> 00:59:47,352
You made all that happen.

1329
00:59:48,444 --> 00:59:49,454
Really?

1330
00:59:49,679 --> 00:59:51,275
I didn't know you thought that.

1331
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:53,332
Unless I forgot.

1332
00:59:54,433 --> 00:59:55,799
No, you didn't forget.

1333
00:59:56,424 --> 00:59:57,768
I never told you.

1334
00:59:59,079 --> 01:00:00,749
And I'm sorry about that.

1335
01:00:02,841 --> 01:00:05,578
But Dory, because of who you are,

1336
01:00:05,903 --> 01:00:08,605
you are about to find your parents.

1337
01:00:10,283 --> 01:00:11,733
And when you do that,

1338
01:00:13,458 --> 01:00:14,058
you,

1339
01:00:15,383 --> 01:00:16,581
you'll be home.

1340
01:00:28,942 --> 01:00:29,942
Dad.

1341
01:00:30,511 --> 01:00:33,261
Does this mean
we have to say goodbye to Dory?

1342
01:00:35,574 --> 01:00:37,424
Yes, Nemo. We do.

1343
01:00:57,679 --> 01:00:59,639
Hey, so how much more we got left to load?

1344
01:00:59,806 --> 01:01:01,106
Just this last row.

1345
01:01:01,130 --> 01:01:03,915
The sooner we finish, the sooner
this truck gets to Cleveland.

1346
01:01:04,311 --> 01:01:06,011
Watch the turn.
Watch what?

1347
01:01:06,772 --> 01:01:07,502
Too late.

1348
01:01:07,527 --> 01:01:08,836
Ok, I think we're close.

1349
01:01:11,401 --> 01:01:12,951
Hi!

1350
01:01:13,070 --> 01:01:14,100
Is this quarantine?

1351
01:01:14,124 --> 01:01:16,059
Yes! This is it!
We're in quarantine!

1352
01:01:16,323 --> 01:01:17,543
My parents are here!

1353
01:01:18,825 --> 01:01:20,075
Where are we going?
Hey, what...

1354
01:01:20,160 --> 01:01:21,471
No, why are we going towards the door?

1355
01:01:21,495 --> 01:01:23,005
We are all better!

1356
01:01:23,789 --> 01:01:25,399
I feel fantastic!

1357
01:01:27,167 --> 01:01:28,167
Dude.

1358
01:01:30,337 --> 01:01:33,547
My family! Come on, let's go!
Excuse me.

1359
01:01:33,632 --> 01:01:34,802
Dory, wait a minute!

1360
01:01:38,387 --> 01:01:39,750
I'm coming Mommy!

1361
01:01:40,175 --> 01:01:42,041
I'm coming Daddy!

1362
01:01:44,275 --> 01:01:45,715
Almost home. Almost home.

1363
01:01:46,139 --> 01:01:47,514
I think I'm getting the hang of this!

1364
01:01:52,651 --> 01:01:53,711
I hear footsteps.

1365
01:01:57,030 --> 01:01:58,030
Hank!
Quiet.

1366
01:01:58,490 --> 01:02:00,770
Hank, we need to get in that tank.
That rhymed.

1367
01:02:00,834 --> 01:02:02,674
Why?
Her parents are there!

1368
01:02:04,413 --> 01:02:05,157
Look,

1369
01:02:06,031 --> 01:02:08,208
you've got three minutes to get
everyone in this cup with you

1370
01:02:08,232 --> 01:02:10,223
and then I'm on that truck
to Cleveland, got it?

1371
01:02:10,544 --> 01:02:11,544
Got it.

1372
01:02:15,924 --> 01:02:16,984
Oh boy.

1373
01:02:21,638 --> 01:02:23,148
Mom? Dad?

1374
01:02:23,515 --> 01:02:24,598
Mom? Dad?

1375
01:02:25,723 --> 01:02:27,770
Hey, everybody. It's me, Dory!

1376
01:02:29,062 --> 01:02:31,496
Dory? Dory? Dory?
Jenny and Charlie's. Dory? Dory?

1377
01:02:31,690 --> 01:02:33,400
Mom? Dad?

1378
01:02:34,234 --> 01:02:35,644
Mom? Dad?

1379
01:02:37,070 --> 01:02:39,030
Mom? Dad?

1380
01:02:39,948 --> 01:02:42,278
She should just pick 2 and let's go.
Dad.

1381
01:02:42,443 --> 01:02:44,863
What? I'm kidding. It's a reunion.

1382
01:02:44,887 --> 01:02:46,274
Mom? Dad?

1383
01:02:47,499 --> 01:02:48,801
Where are my parents?

1384
01:02:50,083 --> 01:02:50,856
Dory?

1385
01:02:51,081 --> 01:02:53,198
Are you really Jenny and Charlie's girl?

1386
01:02:53,295 --> 01:02:54,975
Yes, I am! That's me!

1387
01:02:55,100 --> 01:02:56,279
Where are they?

1388
01:02:56,381 --> 01:02:59,591
Well, Dory, right after you disappeared,
they thought you...

1389
01:02:59,860 --> 01:03:02,700
Well, they thought you must have
ended up here, in quarantine.

1390
01:03:03,680 --> 01:03:05,500
Come on, come on, come on.

1391
01:03:06,724 --> 01:03:09,674
So they came here to look for you.

1392
01:03:09,736 --> 01:03:11,506
They're here! Where are they?

1393
01:03:13,899 --> 01:03:14,784
Dory,

1394
01:03:15,509 --> 01:03:17,163
that was years ago.

1395
01:03:18,411 --> 01:03:20,351
They never came back.

1396
01:03:20,572 --> 01:03:21,702
Oh no.

1397
01:03:21,723 --> 01:03:22,718
You see Dory,

1398
01:03:22,943 --> 01:03:27,063
when fish don't come back
from quarantine it means...

1399
01:03:27,288 --> 01:03:28,562
they're not...

1400
01:03:29,247 --> 01:03:30,047
What?

1401
01:03:30,791 --> 01:03:32,801
Dory, they're gone.

1402
01:03:33,585 --> 01:03:35,155
They're dead?

1403
01:03:36,213 --> 01:03:39,803
They wanted to find you...
Wait. Are you sure they're gone?

1404
01:03:40,634 --> 01:03:42,764
Dory, listen, it's going to be Ok.

1405
01:03:42,928 --> 01:03:44,298
Dory, they loved you so much.

1406
01:03:44,471 --> 01:03:47,311
Anyone not looking to go to Cleveland,
final warning!

1407
01:03:50,018 --> 01:03:52,448
Dory, are you all right?
Are you Ok?

1408
01:03:52,779 --> 01:03:54,111
I was too late.

1409
01:03:54,136 --> 01:03:56,173
Dory, no. No. Now listen.

1410
01:03:56,216 --> 01:03:57,501
I don't have a family.

1411
01:03:57,525 --> 01:03:59,870
No, Dory. That's not true.

1412
01:04:00,821 --> 01:04:02,931
Time to go!

1413
01:04:03,198 --> 01:04:05,028
I'm all alone.

1414
01:04:05,200 --> 01:04:06,700
Dory.
Dory!

1415
01:04:08,954 --> 01:04:10,374
Where's everybody else?

1416
01:04:11,331 --> 01:04:13,031
Your orange friends are on their way
to Cleveland.

1417
01:04:13,700 --> 01:04:15,070
I found the octopus!

1418
01:04:16,962 --> 01:04:18,172
Where did he go?

1419
01:04:27,013 --> 01:04:28,843
Mommy? Daddy?

1420
01:04:35,689 --> 01:04:36,689
Help.

1421
01:04:38,125 --> 01:04:38,999
No.

1422
01:04:39,524 --> 01:04:40,137
No.

1423
01:04:40,462 --> 01:04:41,144
No.

1424
01:04:41,797 --> 01:04:43,049
Help. Help me.

1425
01:04:43,196 --> 01:04:44,919
Help. Help me.

1426
01:04:45,044 --> 01:04:46,028
Please.

1427
01:04:46,754 --> 01:04:48,184
Somebody help me!

1428
01:04:49,670 --> 01:04:50,265
Hey, can...

1429
01:04:50,290 --> 01:04:52,074
Help me? Can you help me?
I've lost them!

1430
01:04:52,714 --> 01:04:53,667
Lost who?

1431
01:04:53,691 --> 01:04:55,655
I, I, I, I...

1432
01:04:55,917 --> 01:04:58,747
Ah, sorry, honey. I can't help you
if you don't remember.

1433
01:05:02,674 --> 01:05:04,392
Can you help me? I've lost...

1434
01:05:04,717 --> 01:05:05,465
them.

1435
01:05:05,627 --> 01:05:07,157
Can you be more specific?

1436
01:05:07,228 --> 01:05:08,878
My... My... Them! Them! Them!

1437
01:05:15,729 --> 01:05:16,388
Help!

1438
01:05:17,213 --> 01:05:17,983
Help!

1439
01:05:19,566 --> 01:05:20,439
Please?

1440
01:05:21,064 --> 01:05:22,410
They're gone!

1441
01:05:36,541 --> 01:05:38,766
I've lost. I've lost everyone.

1442
01:05:39,191 --> 01:05:41,005
There's nothing I can do.

1443
01:05:43,465 --> 01:05:45,021
Shoot, I can't forget.

1444
01:05:45,146 --> 01:05:46,350
What was I forgetting?

1445
01:05:46,875 --> 01:05:47,803
Something.

1446
01:05:48,995 --> 01:05:50,132
Something important.

1447
01:05:50,457 --> 01:05:51,659
What was it? I...

1448
01:05:53,433 --> 01:05:54,433
What was it?

1449
01:05:55,540 --> 01:05:56,697
It's going away.

1450
01:05:57,604 --> 01:06:01,614
It's going away. It's going because
all I can do is forget. I just forget.

1451
01:06:01,638 --> 01:06:05,795
And I forget. That's what I do best.
That's what I do.

1452
01:06:07,239 --> 01:06:11,789
What do I do? What do I do?
What do I do? What do I do?

1453
01:06:13,787 --> 01:06:15,357
What would Dory do?

1454
01:06:18,124 --> 01:06:19,964
I would look around.

1455
01:06:20,662 --> 01:06:21,622
And...

1456
01:06:22,647 --> 01:06:23,787
there's just water over there.

1457
01:06:24,112 --> 01:06:25,951
And a lot of kelp over here.

1458
01:06:27,200 --> 01:06:28,870
Kelp is better. Ok.

1459
01:06:36,083 --> 01:06:39,273
Now what? Lots of kelp.
It looks the same.

1460
01:06:40,305 --> 01:06:43,290
It all looks the same, except there's a rock...

1461
01:06:44,215 --> 01:06:45,309
over there.

1462
01:06:45,652 --> 01:06:47,769
And some sand this way.

1463
01:06:48,394 --> 01:06:50,546
I like sand. Sand is squishy.

1464
01:07:06,339 --> 01:07:07,839
Oh this isn't going anywhere.

1465
01:07:09,968 --> 01:07:11,447
There's nothing here.

1466
01:07:12,372 --> 01:07:13,577
Nothing but kelp.

1467
01:07:14,102 --> 01:07:15,181
Lots of kelp.

1468
01:07:15,423 --> 01:07:16,778
And some shells...

1469
01:07:17,903 --> 01:07:19,377
this way.

1470
01:07:20,687 --> 01:07:22,017
I like shells.

1471
01:07:25,567 --> 01:07:28,387
I like... shells.

1472
01:08:34,135 --> 01:08:34,864
Hello.

1473
01:08:35,189 --> 01:08:36,568
I'm...
Dory!

1474
01:08:36,693 --> 01:08:39,160
Dory! You're here.

1475
01:08:39,307 --> 01:08:41,057
Oh my baby!
You're really here.

1476
01:08:41,226 --> 01:08:42,411
Let me look at you.
You found us.

1477
01:08:42,435 --> 01:08:44,705
I'm never letting you go again.
Oh my missing girl, you're here.

1478
01:08:44,729 --> 01:08:45,769
My baby!
It's you.

1479
01:08:45,939 --> 01:08:49,609
Yes! Oh absolutely!
It's really you! Mom, you're here.

1480
01:08:49,776 --> 01:08:52,446
I am, I...
And Dad, so are you.

1481
01:08:52,529 --> 01:08:54,069
Right here, kelpcake.

1482
01:08:57,617 --> 01:08:59,287
I'm so sorry.

1483
01:08:59,452 --> 01:09:01,032
Why?
Oh honey, no, no.

1484
01:09:01,257 --> 01:09:02,146
No Kelpcake.

1485
01:09:02,288 --> 01:09:03,905
I know I've got a problem.

1486
01:09:04,130 --> 01:09:05,882
I know I'm... And I'm so sorry.

1487
01:09:05,906 --> 01:09:07,563
And all this time I've wanted to fix it,

1488
01:09:07,587 --> 01:09:09,930
and I can't and, and I try. I try.

1489
01:09:09,954 --> 01:09:13,126
But my thoughts,
they leave my head and ideas change.

1490
01:09:13,299 --> 01:09:15,429
And I'd forgotten you and I'm so sorry.
Dory?

1491
01:09:15,593 --> 01:09:18,130
Dory, Dory, don't you dare be sorry.

1492
01:09:18,955 --> 01:09:20,667
Look what you did.

1493
01:09:21,407 --> 01:09:22,200
What?

1494
01:09:22,525 --> 01:09:24,991
You found us!
That's right.

1495
01:09:25,316 --> 01:09:26,428
You found us.

1496
01:09:27,397 --> 01:09:31,257
Honey, honey, why do you think
we stayed put here all these years?

1497
01:09:31,526 --> 01:09:33,571
Because we believed one day,

1498
01:09:33,696 --> 01:09:35,380
you'd find us again.

1499
01:09:35,488 --> 01:09:36,558
Exactly!

1500
01:09:37,365 --> 01:09:40,325
But, I thought you were gone.
How did you...

1501
01:09:40,410 --> 01:09:43,460
We went into quarantine
to look for you, but you weren't there.

1502
01:09:43,484 --> 01:09:46,521
And we knew you must have
gotten out through, through the pipes.

1503
01:09:46,545 --> 01:09:49,145
Through the pipes. That's right, sweetie.
And so we did too.

1504
01:09:49,169 --> 01:09:53,009
And we've stayed in this spot
for you ever since.

1505
01:09:53,073 --> 01:09:55,234
Because, because we thought
you might come back.

1506
01:09:55,675 --> 01:09:58,675
So every day, we go out and lay out...

1507
01:09:59,637 --> 01:10:00,717
Shells.

1508
01:10:06,186 --> 01:10:08,141
And you found us.

1509
01:10:08,866 --> 01:10:09,891
Oh honey,

1510
01:10:10,316 --> 01:10:13,691
you found us and you know why you
found us? Because you remembered.

1511
01:10:15,236 --> 01:10:20,156
You remembered in your own,
amazing, Dory way.

1512
01:10:22,660 --> 01:10:23,483
I did.

1513
01:10:24,208 --> 01:10:25,464
All by myself.

1514
01:10:25,605 --> 01:10:27,102
Oh, honey. Really?

1515
01:10:27,327 --> 01:10:31,229
Have you been by yourself all these years?

1516
01:10:31,477 --> 01:10:33,147
Oh, my poor little girl.

1517
01:10:33,213 --> 01:10:34,935
I haven't been all by myself...

1518
01:10:35,560 --> 01:10:36,807
Marlin and Nemo!

1519
01:10:38,009 --> 01:10:39,540
Nobody saw where Dory went?

1520
01:10:39,641 --> 01:10:40,921
No. Sorry.
Seriously?

1521
01:10:41,245 --> 01:10:43,355
That's a lot of eyeballs doing nothing.

1522
01:10:43,515 --> 01:10:45,095
Oh, excuse me. Can you help us?

1523
01:10:45,266 --> 01:10:46,766
We're looking...
Me help you?

1524
01:10:50,563 --> 01:10:52,303
Dad, look! It's Dory.

1525
01:10:52,524 --> 01:10:53,542
Thank goodness.

1526
01:10:53,667 --> 01:10:56,419
See, Nemo, I knew she'd find a way...
What?

1527
01:10:56,712 --> 01:10:58,432
Hey, where's Dory?
Is she with you?

1528
01:10:59,213 --> 01:11:00,403
I'm sorry.

1529
01:11:00,782 --> 01:11:03,742
I tried to hold on, but I couldn't and I lost her.

1530
01:11:03,868 --> 01:11:05,728
What?
All right. Let's get going.

1531
01:11:05,954 --> 01:11:07,024
No!

1532
01:11:07,288 --> 01:11:09,788
And then the whale swallowed us
even though I speak whale.

1533
01:11:09,874 --> 01:11:11,403
A whale?
Good thing I wasn't there to see that.

1534
01:11:11,427 --> 01:11:14,188
Actually Marlin never believes
I even know how to speak whale but,

1535
01:11:14,212 --> 01:11:15,932
you know what, he always kind of
trusts me anyway.

1536
01:11:15,956 --> 01:11:17,756
You know, I like this Marlin already.
Yeah.

1537
01:11:17,924 --> 01:11:20,394
And then somehow we found Nemo.
Or did he find me?

1538
01:11:20,552 --> 01:11:22,972
I don't know. But, you know what,
Nemo is the sweetest.

1539
01:11:23,138 --> 01:11:24,858
He just never gives up on me
no matter what.

1540
01:11:25,031 --> 01:11:26,101
What would Dory do?

1541
01:11:26,125 --> 01:11:29,056
Well, we'll certainly have to thank
Marlin and Nemo when we meet them.

1542
01:11:30,603 --> 01:11:32,673
Wait. Wait I know this place.

1543
01:11:32,981 --> 01:11:35,981
Hello. I'm Sigourney Weaver.

1544
01:11:36,009 --> 01:11:36,699
There!

1545
01:11:37,123 --> 01:11:38,819
Won't you please join us?

1546
01:11:38,820 --> 01:11:40,255
That's the Marine Life Institute.

1547
01:11:40,780 --> 01:11:41,974
You were born there.

1548
01:11:41,998 --> 01:11:42,945
Dory, is that where your friends are?

1549
01:11:43,116 --> 01:11:45,313
Yes! They, they were stuck in, in something.

1550
01:11:45,538 --> 01:11:47,180
It was. It was going somewhere.

1551
01:11:48,454 --> 01:11:50,114
A truck. They're in the truck!

1552
01:11:50,290 --> 01:11:51,245
That means I could...

1553
01:11:51,270 --> 01:11:52,314
Never see them again!

1554
01:11:52,458 --> 01:11:53,509
No! No, no, no.

1555
01:11:53,510 --> 01:11:55,022
What would Dory do? What would Dory do?

1556
01:11:55,461 --> 01:11:57,574
I know they're good friends of yours,

1557
01:11:57,599 --> 01:11:59,655
but a truck is kind of a tall order.

1558
01:11:59,679 --> 01:12:01,299
Yeah your mother as right Dory.
Please! Please, all I know.

1559
01:12:01,324 --> 01:12:02,991
Is that I miss them. I... I...

1560
01:12:03,436 --> 01:12:05,493
I really, really miss them.

1561
01:12:06,718 --> 01:12:08,190
I've said that before.

1562
01:12:10,602 --> 01:12:11,602
Dory?

1563
01:12:11,769 --> 01:12:15,002
Mom, Marlin and Nemo are more
than good friends, they're...

1564
01:12:15,327 --> 01:12:16,504
they're family.

1565
01:12:16,649 --> 01:12:18,162
And, and I have to get them back.

1566
01:12:18,387 --> 01:12:20,453
See, when they found me it felt like fate.

1567
01:12:20,653 --> 01:12:21,720
Do you know what I mean? Or...

1568
01:12:21,845 --> 01:12:23,353
I don't... What's another word for fate?

1569
01:12:23,489 --> 01:12:25,215
Like destiny.

1570
01:12:25,740 --> 01:12:26,640
Destiny?

1571
01:12:26,659 --> 01:12:28,369
Destiny!

1572
01:12:28,870 --> 01:12:29,510
Dory?

1573
01:12:30,955 --> 01:12:31,955
Morning, Dest.

1574
01:12:32,847 --> 01:12:34,129
It's Dory. Something's wrong.

1575
01:12:37,202 --> 01:12:39,042
I got her. She's right outside the institute.

1576
01:12:41,132 --> 01:12:42,302
Destiny?
We got to jump.

1577
01:12:42,467 --> 01:12:43,847
Jump?
No time to argue!

1578
01:12:44,177 --> 01:12:45,477
Destiny!

1579
01:12:45,603 --> 01:12:48,683
Dory! Dory! The truck thing
with your friends is leaving!

1580
01:12:48,748 --> 01:12:50,238
Oh no. No, no, no.
Destiny?

1581
01:12:55,338 --> 01:12:56,338
All right.
Yes.

1582
01:12:56,489 --> 01:12:57,489
Here we go.
Yes.

1583
01:12:57,513 --> 01:12:58,416
One.
Yes.

1584
01:12:58,440 --> 01:12:59,616
Two.
No yet!

1585
01:12:59,617 --> 01:13:01,297
I can't do it!
I'll never make it out there.

1586
01:13:01,321 --> 01:13:02,207
Destiny!

1587
01:13:02,432 --> 01:13:04,888
I've got the world's most
powerful pair of glasses.

1588
01:13:04,912 --> 01:13:06,842
You've got the world's most
powerful pair of glasses.

1589
01:13:06,866 --> 01:13:08,196
I will be your eyes.

1590
01:13:08,268 --> 01:13:09,270
You can be my eyes.

1591
01:13:09,295 --> 01:13:10,522
But, but, but, but, but the walls!

1592
01:13:10,546 --> 01:13:12,808
There are no walls in the ocean!

1593
01:13:13,939 --> 01:13:14,722
No walls?

1594
01:13:14,747 --> 01:13:16,494
It's your destiny, Destiny.

1595
01:13:16,793 --> 01:13:18,743
Well, why didn't you say so.

1596
01:13:19,003 --> 01:13:22,343
What? No! Destiny, wait!
No, that's a wall! Wall!

1597
01:13:27,720 --> 01:13:30,430
Mom, Dad, this is my pipe pal.
Destiny, say hi.

1598
01:13:30,598 --> 01:13:32,478
Dory! Are these little blue blobs
your parents?

1599
01:13:32,558 --> 01:13:33,938
They look just like you!

1600
01:13:34,602 --> 01:13:37,132
Hello. I'm Bailey.
Mrs Dory, Mr Dory.

1601
01:13:37,156 --> 01:13:38,616
Oh please, call me Jenny.
Oh and I'm Charlie.

1602
01:13:38,640 --> 01:13:40,780
Ok. Ok. We got to go.
We got to stop that truck.

1603
01:13:41,301 --> 01:13:42,301
Ok, what truck?

1604
01:13:45,071 --> 01:13:46,411
Bailey, status report.

1605
01:13:46,572 --> 01:13:47,942
Oh, yes, my beautiful gift.

1606
01:13:50,209 --> 01:13:53,081
Found it! The truck's merging onto
the freeway and it's heading south.

1607
01:13:53,446 --> 01:13:54,436
Let's go.

1608
01:13:54,760 --> 01:13:56,060
We are stopping that truck.

1609
01:13:57,458 --> 01:14:00,108
This I've got to see.
Yeah, yeah, me too!

1610
01:14:00,920 --> 01:14:02,740
Oh boy, this is gonna be good!

1611
01:14:03,423 --> 01:14:04,397
What the... Gerald!

1612
01:14:04,622 --> 01:14:05,907
Have you lost your marbles?

1613
01:14:05,931 --> 01:14:07,650
Don't get used to it, Gerald!

1614
01:14:07,774 --> 01:14:08,774
Cheeky joke.

1615
01:14:11,764 --> 01:14:13,644
Bailey, I forgot everything.
Catch me up.

1616
01:14:13,708 --> 01:14:14,485
Yes, ma'am.

1617
01:14:15,310 --> 01:14:16,592
Your friends are still on the truck.

1618
01:14:17,136 --> 01:14:18,376
They're headed north towards the bridge.

1619
01:14:19,447 --> 01:14:21,877
Look, there's a bunch of cute otters over there.

1620
01:14:22,108 --> 01:14:23,228
I want one!

1621
01:14:27,663 --> 01:14:28,663
Bailey!

1622
01:14:28,706 --> 01:14:30,486
I see the truck. It's over there.

1623
01:14:30,658 --> 01:14:32,269
I don't see how we can get out Dory.

1624
01:14:32,293 --> 01:14:34,503
Oh, man, if only there was a way
to stop traffic.

1625
01:14:34,662 --> 01:14:37,152
Stop traffic. Stop traffic!
Everyone needs to stop.

1626
01:14:37,276 --> 01:14:38,334
People stop to look at things.

1627
01:14:38,358 --> 01:14:39,660
Things that they like.
Things that are cute.

1628
01:14:40,084 --> 01:14:41,117
Things that are cute!

1629
01:14:41,842 --> 01:14:43,079
Ok, I got it.
What?

1630
01:14:43,129 --> 01:14:43,929
What is it?

1631
01:14:43,953 --> 01:14:44,953
Quickly before I forget.

1632
01:14:44,977 --> 01:14:47,426
Destiny, when the truck reaches
the bridge you flip me up there.

1633
01:14:47,450 --> 01:14:48,380
Got it.

1634
01:14:48,509 --> 01:14:49,696
You guys, follow me.

1635
01:14:49,921 --> 01:14:51,323
Everyone else, stay here.

1636
01:14:52,547 --> 01:14:54,721
Dory. Honey, you're not leaving us again.

1637
01:14:54,745 --> 01:14:56,726
Your mother's right.
You have to stay with us.

1638
01:14:56,727 --> 01:14:58,142
Sweetie, what happens if...

1639
01:14:58,467 --> 01:14:59,790
You know, if, if, if you're gone...
Mom.

1640
01:14:59,795 --> 01:15:00,782
For too long.

1641
01:15:01,022 --> 01:15:02,072
And what if you get confused,
Mom!

1642
01:15:02,097 --> 01:15:03,834
And that makes you distracted.
And what if...

1643
01:15:03,858 --> 01:15:05,148
I lose you again?

1644
01:15:06,927 --> 01:15:07,927
Yes.

1645
01:15:09,238 --> 01:15:12,028
Mom, Dad, it's gonna be Ok because...

1646
01:15:12,200 --> 01:15:14,019
I know that even if I forget,

1647
01:15:14,544 --> 01:15:16,024
I can find you again.

1648
01:15:20,941 --> 01:15:21,997
Ok a little left.

1649
01:15:22,922 --> 01:15:24,051
Back the other way a bit.

1650
01:15:24,212 --> 01:15:26,342
Ok, that's it. Go! Don't do it.

1651
01:15:26,366 --> 01:15:27,708
Bailey!
Ok, now! Now!

1652
01:15:27,733 --> 01:15:29,300
Do it! Do it!
Time for your idea.

1653
01:15:29,525 --> 01:15:30,534
Ok. What idea?

1654
01:15:38,109 --> 01:15:40,749
Ok. Ok. What do I do?
What would Dory do?

1655
01:15:40,773 --> 01:15:41,770
What do I do?

1656
01:15:41,771 --> 01:15:42,929
Come on, cars, cars. I see cars.

1657
01:15:43,054 --> 01:15:44,075
Otters in front of cars.

1658
01:15:44,273 --> 01:15:45,238
Cars have to stop.

1659
01:15:45,263 --> 01:15:46,817
Stop traffic! Cuddle party!

1660
01:15:49,821 --> 01:15:50,821
Look out!

1661
01:15:52,824 --> 01:15:54,414
They're so cute!

1662
01:15:54,534 --> 01:15:56,854
Look at them!
There must be one, two...

1663
01:16:00,873 --> 01:16:03,133
What's going on, Dad?
I don't know.

1664
01:16:03,401 --> 01:16:04,415
I don't know in what way,

1665
01:16:04,540 --> 01:16:06,305
but I think this has something to do with...

1666
01:16:09,132 --> 01:16:10,272
Dory!

1667
01:16:10,297 --> 01:16:12,816
Water. Water. I need water.

1668
01:16:13,052 --> 01:16:14,412
Are you crazy? How'd you get here?

1669
01:16:15,680 --> 01:16:16,850
Dory!

1670
01:16:17,573 --> 01:16:19,243
I thought we'd never see you again.

1671
01:16:19,568 --> 01:16:20,257
Me too.

1672
01:16:20,393 --> 01:16:23,383
But, darn it, no matter how hard I tried
I just couldn't forget you.

1673
01:16:24,730 --> 01:16:26,850
I guess I missed the rest of my family
too much,

1674
01:16:27,275 --> 01:16:28,585
We're family?

1675
01:16:30,069 --> 01:16:31,569
Do you know what that feels like?

1676
01:16:31,904 --> 01:16:35,074
Yes, I know what that feels like.

1677
01:16:37,743 --> 01:16:38,740
Hey! Hey, come on.

1678
01:16:38,865 --> 01:16:40,907
Out of the truck.
Those aren't your fish.

1679
01:16:41,247 --> 01:16:43,587
Oh no. There goes our ride.
Back in the water. Come on.

1680
01:16:43,916 --> 01:16:46,916
Dory, the traffic is starting to move.

1681
01:16:47,545 --> 01:16:48,705
Leave it to me. I got this.

1682
01:16:51,357 --> 01:16:52,886
Becky! Becky, come back.

1683
01:16:53,211 --> 01:16:54,831
We need your help! Becky!

1684
01:16:56,971 --> 01:16:58,141
Dory, follow me.

1685
01:16:59,473 --> 01:17:01,276
No, no, wait. We don't have Dory!

1686
01:17:01,401 --> 01:17:02,937
No, no, Becky wait! Stop it.

1687
01:17:02,977 --> 01:17:05,467
We need to go back. Becky, back!
Back, Becky!

1688
01:17:08,557 --> 01:17:10,107
Please don't eat us!
Where's Dory?

1689
01:17:10,276 --> 01:17:11,896
Who are you?
Jenny?

1690
01:17:12,028 --> 01:17:13,238
Marlin?
Charlie?

1691
01:17:13,262 --> 01:17:13,862
Nemo?

1692
01:17:14,847 --> 01:17:17,407
Thank you, thank you so much
for taking care of Dory.

1693
01:17:17,408 --> 01:17:19,128
Dory! She's still in the truck.

1694
01:17:19,493 --> 01:17:21,493
Becky! Fetch Dory!

1695
01:17:26,751 --> 01:17:28,761
Ok, kid. I guess this is goodbye.

1696
01:17:29,086 --> 01:17:30,096
No!
What do you mean, No?

1697
01:17:30,120 --> 01:17:32,683
I mean you're not going to the Cleveland.
You are coming to the ocean with me.

1698
01:17:32,707 --> 01:17:34,627
What is it with you and ruining my plans?

1699
01:17:34,651 --> 01:17:36,758
Listen to me, I have one goal in life.
One!

1700
01:17:36,782 --> 01:17:37,821
No. Listen to me.
And it is to...

1701
01:17:38,570 --> 01:17:40,275
What is so great about plans?

1702
01:17:40,299 --> 01:17:41,600
I never had a plan.

1703
01:17:41,682 --> 01:17:43,186
Did I plan to lose my parents?
No.

1704
01:17:43,210 --> 01:17:44,896
Did I plan to find Marlin?
No.

1705
01:17:45,336 --> 01:17:46,620
Did you and I plan to meet?

1706
01:17:47,045 --> 01:17:47,980
Wait. Did we?

1707
01:17:48,189 --> 01:17:50,159
Are you almost done?
Well, I don't think we did.

1708
01:17:50,183 --> 01:17:53,363
And that's because the best things
happen by chance because that's life.

1709
01:17:53,486 --> 01:17:54,841
And that's you being with me,

1710
01:17:54,966 --> 01:17:57,850
out in the ocean,
not safe in some stupid glass box.

1711
01:17:57,874 --> 01:17:59,301
Can I say something?
I'm not done!

1712
01:17:59,325 --> 01:18:01,274
A friend of mine. Her name's Sigourney.

1713
01:18:01,298 --> 01:18:04,018
Once told me that all it
takes is three simple steps:

1714
01:18:04,042 --> 01:18:07,710
Rescue, rehabilitation,
and one other thing...

1715
01:18:07,875 --> 01:18:08,875
Release!

1716
01:18:10,002 --> 01:18:12,072
That's right! So what do you say?

1717
01:18:12,338 --> 01:18:15,098
Release! Release! Release!

1718
01:18:15,266 --> 01:18:18,456
Release! Release! Release!

1719
01:18:18,586 --> 01:18:21,226
Release! Release! Release!

1720
01:18:21,250 --> 01:18:22,614
I was gonna say, Ok.

1721
01:18:25,393 --> 01:18:26,533
Not good.

1722
01:18:27,061 --> 01:18:28,061
Oh no, no, no!

1723
01:18:28,085 --> 01:18:29,145
Charlie they're going away!

1724
01:18:29,146 --> 01:18:30,586
Quick! Guys, grab my fin!

1725
01:18:33,317 --> 01:18:34,488
He's trying to get the door open.

1726
01:18:35,313 --> 01:18:36,427
It's locked from the outside.

1727
01:18:36,451 --> 01:18:37,864
Come on, Dory. You can do it.

1728
01:18:37,888 --> 01:18:40,170
Destiny! Destiny! Wall! Wall! Wall!

1729
01:18:41,701 --> 01:18:44,251
Oh no! Dory, no! Wait!
Dory!

1730
01:18:44,912 --> 01:18:46,106
Bailey, where are they headed?

1731
01:18:47,131 --> 01:18:48,346
I'm losing them.

1732
01:18:52,837 --> 01:18:54,497
Dory, it's over.

1733
01:18:54,847 --> 01:18:56,779
No, there's, there's,
there's got to be a way.

1734
01:18:57,004 --> 01:18:58,071
Yeah. There's a way!

1735
01:18:58,217 --> 01:19:00,747
Dory, now listen to me.
There's no way to get out.

1736
01:19:01,012 --> 01:19:03,352
But. There's got to be a way.
There's always a way.

1737
01:19:03,931 --> 01:19:07,231
There isn't, Dory. I'm telling you.
This time there is no other way.

1738
01:19:07,727 --> 01:19:08,767
Well, what about that?

1739
01:19:10,938 --> 01:19:12,728
Holy carp. There is another way.

1740
01:19:13,707 --> 01:19:15,117
Take a deep breath, kid.

1741
01:19:15,443 --> 01:19:17,743
Release! Release! Release!

1742
01:19:17,903 --> 01:19:21,333
Release! Release! Release! Release!

1743
01:19:27,579 --> 01:19:28,389
What is that?

1744
01:19:28,873 --> 01:19:30,173
I don't care what it is!
Get it off!

1745
01:19:30,358 --> 01:19:31,158
What the...

1746
01:19:32,126 --> 01:19:33,586
Suck it, bipeds.

1747
01:19:34,754 --> 01:19:36,556
All right, Hank, you've got seven arms...

1748
01:19:36,581 --> 01:19:38,038
I don't know. Just try something.

1749
01:19:38,132 --> 01:19:39,132
Ok. Here we go.

1750
01:19:40,868 --> 01:19:42,341
Hey! Stop. Stop. Wait! Stop!

1751
01:19:44,766 --> 01:19:45,766
That's doing something.

1752
01:19:45,790 --> 01:19:47,597
And we are moving, good job, Hank.

1753
01:19:47,725 --> 01:19:49,139
Wait, wait, wait! Come on!

1754
01:19:50,864 --> 01:19:52,409
Wait, wait! Wait! Wait!

1755
01:19:52,433 --> 01:19:54,503
Listen, I'm not trying to tell you
how to drive.

1756
01:19:54,728 --> 01:19:55,937
Certainly I can't do...

1757
01:19:55,975 --> 01:19:57,975
I'm not in any position,
but could, but could you go faster?

1758
01:20:03,574 --> 01:20:05,444
Hey! Give us our truck back!

1759
01:20:05,668 --> 01:20:07,308
I can't see squat.
Which way are we going?

1760
01:20:07,620 --> 01:20:10,260
Ok. Well, all, all, all the cars
are going left so...

1761
01:20:10,385 --> 01:20:11,564
so go left.

1762
01:20:11,665 --> 01:20:12,695
Gilman Street.

1763
01:20:13,020 --> 01:20:14,043
Ashby Avenue.

1764
01:20:14,338 --> 01:20:15,133
Powell.

1765
01:20:15,169 --> 01:20:17,709
Gilman Street again.
Gilman Street again.

1766
01:20:17,797 --> 01:20:19,627
How much longer
are we gonna veer left?

1767
01:20:23,302 --> 01:20:25,082
Ok, we just need to know how we got on,

1768
01:20:25,106 --> 01:20:26,602
and then we'll know how to get off.

1769
01:20:26,626 --> 01:20:28,322
Well, let me know when you figure it out.

1770
01:20:28,346 --> 01:20:30,018
Unfortunately I can't
remember how we got on.

1771
01:20:30,142 --> 01:20:32,762
Hey, I know those guys!
That's where we came from. Turn right.

1772
01:20:33,187 --> 01:20:34,187
Here we go!

1773
01:20:38,943 --> 01:20:41,181
Hey! Hey, hey, hey! Wait!

1774
01:20:43,823 --> 01:20:45,423
We are so fired.

1775
01:20:46,200 --> 01:20:47,280
Straight. Straight.

1776
01:20:47,505 --> 01:20:48,280
Left. Left.

1777
01:20:48,305 --> 01:20:50,428
No, no, no. Right. Right. Right.

1778
01:20:51,564 --> 01:20:52,368
Good driving, Hank.

1779
01:20:52,393 --> 01:20:53,578
Pay attention to the road.

1780
01:20:53,874 --> 01:20:54,653
I'm sorry.

1781
01:20:55,278 --> 01:20:56,178
Fork in the road.

1782
01:20:56,202 --> 01:20:58,362
Which way?
Ocean. Ocean. Hey, a boat!

1783
01:20:58,386 --> 01:21:00,490
You know, I haven't had great
experiences with boats, but I...

1784
01:21:00,514 --> 01:21:01,377
Which way?

1785
01:21:02,202 --> 01:21:03,489
Boats go to the ocean. Right!

1786
01:21:03,843 --> 01:21:04,843
Hold on!

1787
01:21:07,864 --> 01:21:09,833
We're out of time, kid.
Where do we go now?

1788
01:21:10,357 --> 01:21:11,057
Well...

1789
01:21:11,281 --> 01:21:13,068
Let me know when you figure it out.
I, I, I, I don't know but.

1790
01:21:13,069 --> 01:21:14,419
Well, something will come and...

1791
01:21:16,021 --> 01:21:17,021
Seagulls.

1792
01:21:17,059 --> 01:21:19,896
Hank, follow those birds!
The ocean's left, Hank.

1793
01:21:21,277 --> 01:21:22,707
Mine, mine, mine, mine.

1794
01:21:23,837 --> 01:21:24,620
Hold on.

1795
01:21:25,245 --> 01:21:26,368
I'm getting something.

1796
01:21:26,432 --> 01:21:27,792
Is it them?
Is everything perfect?

1797
01:21:29,133 --> 01:21:30,843
It's the fuzz. Busted.

1798
01:21:34,982 --> 01:21:35,977
Ok, we're good.

1799
01:21:36,002 --> 01:21:36,743
The ocean!

1800
01:21:37,268 --> 01:21:38,590
It's straight ahead. Floor it!

1801
01:21:38,711 --> 01:21:39,711
Now we're talking.

1802
01:21:42,822 --> 01:21:44,042
What do you mean, "Uh-oh"?

1803
01:21:44,466 --> 01:21:46,205
Oh no. What would I do?
What would I do? What?

1804
01:21:46,230 --> 01:21:47,150
What would I do?

1805
01:21:47,928 --> 01:21:50,308
Hank, I'm gonna ask you
to do something crazy.

1806
01:21:50,431 --> 01:21:51,801
I'm Ok with crazy.

1807
01:21:52,808 --> 01:21:53,918
All right, Hank.

1808
01:21:54,643 --> 01:21:57,093
There's no way out. It's over.
They're going to fish jail!

1809
01:21:58,055 --> 01:21:58,905
Wait.

1810
01:21:59,630 --> 01:22:00,367
Oh no.

1811
01:22:00,592 --> 01:22:03,103
Get back! Incoming!

1812
01:22:35,893 --> 01:22:38,943
Fish!

1813
01:22:42,608 --> 01:22:45,238
Dory!

1814
01:22:45,319 --> 01:22:46,989
What lies before you

1815
01:22:47,071 --> 01:22:51,379
represents the third and final part
of the Marine Life mission.

1816
01:22:51,742 --> 01:22:54,945
Rescue, rehabilitation,

1817
01:22:55,970 --> 01:22:57,536
and release.

1818
01:22:57,665 --> 01:22:59,455
Come to Papa.

1819
01:23:05,089 --> 01:23:08,299
I'm Sigourney Weaver.
Thank you for joining me.

1820
01:23:11,303 --> 01:23:15,103
One, two, three, four...

1821
01:23:17,142 --> 01:23:18,754
Wait a minute. Why am I counting?

1822
01:23:18,879 --> 01:23:20,086
Hey, where is everyone?

1823
01:23:20,687 --> 01:23:22,104
Did they leave me?

1824
01:23:22,229 --> 01:23:24,437
No! No, no. They wouldn't do that.

1825
01:23:24,608 --> 01:23:26,266
Ok. That's Ok. I can figure this out.

1826
01:23:26,391 --> 01:23:27,812
What was I just doing then?
I was...

1827
01:23:28,753 --> 01:23:31,763
covering my face,
so I was trying to hide.

1828
01:23:31,924 --> 01:23:33,794
Ok, so why was I trying to hide? Wait!

1829
01:23:34,159 --> 01:23:35,999
I... Five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten.

1830
01:23:36,078 --> 01:23:37,338
Ready or not, here I come!

1831
01:23:37,663 --> 01:23:38,703
Found you!

1832
01:23:39,164 --> 01:23:40,004
I see you!

1833
01:23:40,524 --> 01:23:41,324
Gotcha!

1834
01:23:41,375 --> 01:23:43,235
All right, you little shrimps, recess is over.

1835
01:23:43,502 --> 01:23:45,372
Oh, man.
Nobody found me!

1836
01:23:45,838 --> 01:23:47,758
Bring it in. Bring it in.
Time for another...

1837
01:23:47,840 --> 01:23:49,400
Don't touch me.
Time for another lesson.

1838
01:23:49,550 --> 01:23:52,050
When is Mr Ray coming back
from his migration?

1839
01:23:52,219 --> 01:23:54,289
If he's smart he'll stay away
from here as long as he can.

1840
01:23:54,313 --> 01:23:56,353
But until he does,
I'm your substitute teacher.

1841
01:23:56,377 --> 01:23:58,845
Ok kids, who wants
to learn about echolocation?

1842
01:23:59,218 --> 01:24:00,218
Nobody.

1843
01:24:00,752 --> 01:24:02,452
Come on guys, it's actually really cool.

1844
01:24:02,476 --> 01:24:04,063
Ok, kelpcake. Have fun.

1845
01:24:04,323 --> 01:24:05,593
Nice day for a swim?

1846
01:24:06,158 --> 01:24:07,888
All right. Bye Mom. Bye Dad.

1847
01:24:08,060 --> 01:24:09,679
Well, I guess we'll go back home and...

1848
01:24:10,504 --> 01:24:11,934
brush up on the anemone.

1849
01:24:12,072 --> 01:24:13,272
You coming, Dory?

1850
01:24:13,532 --> 01:24:15,392
Me? Oh I'm just going to the dropoff.

1851
01:24:16,035 --> 01:24:17,115
Ok. What?

1852
01:24:17,340 --> 01:24:18,979
The dropoff? No!

1853
01:24:19,246 --> 01:24:21,216
That's. That's.That's a good idea?

1854
01:24:21,440 --> 01:24:23,658
Yeah. I just thought I'd go enjoy the view.

1855
01:24:23,783 --> 01:24:24,555
Bye. Bye.

1856
01:24:25,335 --> 01:24:28,005
The view.
Well, you have a good time!

1857
01:24:28,380 --> 01:24:29,721
All by yourself.

1858
01:24:30,346 --> 01:24:32,654
Not getting lost.

1859
01:24:51,403 --> 01:24:53,286
Oh, no, no, no. no, Dory.

1860
01:24:54,011 --> 01:24:54,666
Dory.

1861
01:24:55,191 --> 01:24:55,931
Dory!

1862
01:24:56,355 --> 01:24:56,855
Do...

1863
01:25:09,588 --> 01:25:11,758
Hey, Marlin.
Oh, hey. Hello, Dory.

1864
01:25:11,924 --> 01:25:13,384
You all right? You look worried.

1865
01:25:13,550 --> 01:25:15,075
No, no, no. I'm fine.

1866
01:25:15,100 --> 01:25:16,914
It's how I always look.

1867
01:25:21,683 --> 01:25:22,683
What?

1868
01:25:22,935 --> 01:25:24,115
Well, I just...

1869
01:25:26,230 --> 01:25:27,390
You did it.

1870
01:25:30,191 --> 01:25:31,581
You did it, kelpcake.

1871
01:25:31,944 --> 01:25:32,613
Yes!

1872
01:25:33,138 --> 01:25:34,138
Did what?

1873
01:25:34,613 --> 01:25:37,340
Sweetie, you just followed the shells,

1874
01:25:37,465 --> 01:25:39,367
all the way back home.

1875
01:25:40,068 --> 01:25:41,584
Oh, my gosh! I did?

1876
01:25:41,709 --> 01:25:43,142
All by myself?

1877
01:25:43,247 --> 01:25:43,830
Yeah.

1878
01:25:43,855 --> 01:25:45,402
Do you know what this means, honey?

1879
01:25:46,291 --> 01:25:50,751
It means you can do whatever
you put your mind to, Dory.

1880
01:25:50,921 --> 01:25:51,961
Really?

1881
01:25:54,066 --> 01:25:56,296
Mommy, can I go play with them?

1882
01:25:56,969 --> 01:26:00,429
Yes.
Absolutely! Go get them, kelpcake.

1883
01:26:05,978 --> 01:26:08,148
Yeah. I did it.

1884
01:26:19,116 --> 01:26:20,986
It really is quite a view.

1885
01:26:25,163 --> 01:26:25,963
Yep.

1886
01:26:27,541 --> 01:26:29,191
Unforgettable.

1887

By LESAIGNEUR
Sync & corrections July 2017

1888
01:35:25,912 --> 01:35:29,712
Off, off, off, off, off, off, off, off, off, off!

1889
01:35:32,544 --> 01:35:34,844
Come on. Roll, roll.
That's it. Hurry!

1890
01:35:34,921 --> 01:35:36,211
That's it. Just roll!

1891
01:35:36,381 --> 01:35:37,051
I'm right behind you.

1892
01:35:37,215 --> 01:35:39,755
You can do it!
Just a little farther. That's it!

1893
01:35:39,926 --> 01:35:42,096
I am truly going to vomit!

1894
01:35:42,762 --> 01:35:45,392
Voilà!
All right, gang, good work.

1895
01:35:46,891 --> 01:35:49,061
Look, Flo, we made it!

1896
01:35:49,227 --> 01:35:51,807
We won't have any more problems
from here on out.

1897
01:35:54,441 --> 01:35:55,731
No respect for ocean life.

1898
01:35:56,734 --> 01:35:57,744
Now what?
