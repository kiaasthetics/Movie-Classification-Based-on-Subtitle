1
00:00:18,235 --> 00:00:20,324
Hey, Audrey, welcome back!

2
00:00:20,368 --> 00:00:22,196
Let me guess, on your
way to teach a class?

3
00:00:22,239 --> 00:00:24,937
Only way to start the day.
Tell Justin I said hi.

4
00:00:31,727 --> 00:00:32,771
Step touch.

5
00:00:34,425 --> 00:00:35,425
Up for two.

6
00:00:36,253 --> 00:00:37,253
Twist.

7
00:00:37,994 --> 00:00:39,126
Left.

8
00:00:40,562 --> 00:00:42,129
Up for two.

9
00:00:42,172 --> 00:00:43,391
Twist.

10
00:00:43,434 --> 00:00:44,522
Right foot, go.

11
00:00:45,871 --> 00:00:48,004
Darlene, nice!

12
00:00:48,048 --> 00:00:50,441
Carl, shoulders down, remember?

13
00:00:50,485 --> 00:00:52,443
Maria, you're killing it.

14
00:00:52,487 --> 00:00:54,445
Come on, finish strong.

15
00:00:55,925 --> 00:00:58,536
One more time. Strong
arms everybody.

16
00:00:58,580 --> 00:00:59,755
Last four, here we go.

17
00:00:59,798 --> 00:01:04,150
Four, three, two, one, whoo!

18
00:01:04,194 --> 00:01:05,543
Yay!

19
00:01:05,587 --> 00:01:08,285
You guys are so good.

20
00:01:08,329 --> 00:01:09,808
Ah, it feels so good to be home.

21
00:01:09,852 --> 00:01:12,072
Thank you so much.

22
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:18,339
We really missed
you, around here.

23
00:01:18,382 --> 00:01:21,820
My water aerobics class just
isn't cutting it these days.

24
00:01:21,864 --> 00:01:25,259
I missed you too,
Maria. Good to see you.

25
00:01:25,301 --> 00:01:26,869
How long are you in town for?

26
00:01:26,912 --> 00:01:29,350
Oh, it's up in the
air at the moment.

27
00:01:29,393 --> 00:01:30,805
I hope you're
not going back to New York

28
00:01:30,829 --> 00:01:33,180
after what happened.

29
00:01:33,223 --> 00:01:37,488
I mean, we're just so happy
to have you back here.

30
00:01:37,532 --> 00:01:38,924
Thanks, Darlene.

31
00:01:38,968 --> 00:01:40,317
I have to go back to the bakery

32
00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:42,102
but can you give your dad these?

33
00:01:42,145 --> 00:01:43,842
I made sugar plum cookies.

34
00:01:43,886 --> 00:01:46,628
His favorite. I'll
make sure he gets them.

35
00:01:46,670 --> 00:01:49,631
Thanks, guys. Thanks
for coming. Bye.

36
00:01:53,634 --> 00:01:55,376
Oh, let me get that, hon.

37
00:01:55,419 --> 00:01:57,769
I need to grab some more
napkins anyway. You're the best.

38
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:01,469
You look hot.

39
00:02:07,083 --> 00:02:09,607
Oh, my gosh, I missed you!

40
00:02:09,651 --> 00:02:11,957
What? I thought you weren't
coming until next week.

41
00:02:12,001 --> 00:02:14,525
Oh, slight change of plans.
I got in late last night.

42
00:02:14,569 --> 00:02:16,397
Oh, God. Why am
I not surprised

43
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:18,070
that the first thing
you'd do is teach a class,

44
00:02:18,094 --> 00:02:19,637
and the second thing is
say hi to your best friend.

45
00:02:19,661 --> 00:02:21,576
You know me, I'm always late.

46
00:02:21,619 --> 00:02:22,925
Come on, I want you to try

47
00:02:22,968 --> 00:02:24,848
this new gingerbread latte
I've been working on.

48
00:02:24,883 --> 00:02:26,407
Mm, yes, please.

49
00:02:26,450 --> 00:02:28,626
Oh, yeah. It's Christmas
in a cup, baby.

50
00:02:32,239 --> 00:02:35,285
So, tell me. What
happened with Bradley?

51
00:02:36,591 --> 00:02:38,375
We decided to take a break.

52
00:02:38,418 --> 00:02:40,334
Wow. Are you okay?

53
00:02:40,377 --> 00:02:43,511
Yes. No. I don't know.

54
00:02:44,599 --> 00:02:46,296
We just needed time apart.

55
00:02:49,995 --> 00:02:51,171
Wow!

56
00:02:51,214 --> 00:02:53,564
Literally Christmas in a cup.

57
00:02:54,652 --> 00:02:57,177
I'm so proud of you.

58
00:02:57,220 --> 00:03:00,092
You made your dream a
reality opening this place.

59
00:03:00,136 --> 00:03:03,444
I feel the same about
all you did in New York.

60
00:03:03,487 --> 00:03:05,489
Yeah, the difference
is I failed.

61
00:03:06,664 --> 00:03:08,579
Which, by the way,

62
00:03:08,623 --> 00:03:10,320
does everyone in town
know my New York gym

63
00:03:10,364 --> 00:03:12,714
ran out of business
or just Darlene?

64
00:03:12,757 --> 00:03:14,846
You know how fast the
news spreads in Mistletoe.

65
00:03:14,890 --> 00:03:16,326
I mean, I think most people knew

66
00:03:16,370 --> 00:03:18,459
that Jim was gonna propose
to me long before I did.

67
00:03:18,502 --> 00:03:20,852
It's because I was too
excited to keep it a secret.

68
00:03:20,896 --> 00:03:22,637
Jim! Audrey!

69
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:24,813
Oh, get in here,
I missed your hug.

70
00:03:24,856 --> 00:03:26,728
Oh! I don't know if
you heard the news

71
00:03:26,771 --> 00:03:30,079
but you are looking at the newest
member of the Mistletoe City Council.

72
00:03:30,122 --> 00:03:31,776
Shablammy. Okay!

73
00:03:31,820 --> 00:03:32,927
You know, honey, you don't
have to wear that all the time.

74
00:03:32,951 --> 00:03:34,779
Oh, she's jealous of my bling.

75
00:03:34,823 --> 00:03:36,128
Congratulations.

76
00:03:36,172 --> 00:03:37,572
I didn't even know
you were running.

77
00:03:37,608 --> 00:03:39,848
Yeah, there's a lot of stuff
that we have to catch up on.

78
00:03:40,655 --> 00:03:41,743
Are you pregnant?

79
00:03:41,786 --> 00:03:43,745
Oh... No. We... we wish.

80
00:03:43,788 --> 00:03:47,662
Yeah, we haven't had time. Right
now we've been consumed with, um...

81
00:03:47,704 --> 00:03:50,099
finding a new location
for Mistletoe Coffee Co.

82
00:03:50,142 --> 00:03:53,015
Why? This is the
perfect place.

83
00:03:53,058 --> 00:03:54,418
The town is closing
the rec center.

84
00:03:55,670 --> 00:03:56,801
Permanently.

85
00:03:58,150 --> 00:03:59,630
How did I not know about this?

86
00:03:59,674 --> 00:04:01,284
I had to wait and
tell you in person.

87
00:04:01,328 --> 00:04:03,286
Yeah, that's why we
kept it on the DL.

88
00:04:03,330 --> 00:04:04,679
Town budget was slashed

89
00:04:04,722 --> 00:04:06,681
and the first thing
on the hit list,

90
00:04:06,724 --> 00:04:08,596
parks and recreation.

91
00:04:08,639 --> 00:04:10,511
I know what this
place means to you.

92
00:04:11,816 --> 00:04:13,992
This is horrible.

93
00:04:14,036 --> 00:04:15,559
And at tomorrow's
council meeting

94
00:04:15,603 --> 00:04:16,709
we're hearing a presentation

95
00:04:16,733 --> 00:04:19,214
from some big ski resort company

96
00:04:19,259 --> 00:04:20,825
that wants to buy
up all the land.

97
00:04:21,783 --> 00:04:24,089
Does anyone have any good news?

98
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:26,309
Any?

99
00:04:26,353 --> 00:04:29,443
Well, you can still teach
in the fitness studio.

100
00:04:29,486 --> 00:04:33,273
Until... well, the
padlocks go up.

101
00:04:39,191 --> 00:04:40,889
Thank you.

102
00:04:40,932 --> 00:04:42,673
The place still smells the same,

103
00:04:42,717 --> 00:04:44,066
peppermint and pine.

104
00:04:44,109 --> 00:04:47,243
Ah, well it's much brighter
now that you're here.

105
00:04:47,287 --> 00:04:48,810
I still can't
believe we have you

106
00:04:48,853 --> 00:04:50,413
for more than three
days this Christmas.

107
00:04:51,943 --> 00:04:54,250
Dad? Yeah.

108
00:04:54,294 --> 00:04:56,600
Why didn't you tell me the
rec center was closing?

109
00:05:00,865 --> 00:05:03,185
You know what, you'd had so
much disappointment in New York,

110
00:05:03,215 --> 00:05:04,826
I just didn't wanna
ruin your homecoming.

111
00:05:06,610 --> 00:05:09,352
I guess I just always
thought it would be there.

112
00:05:09,396 --> 00:05:12,137
You know, part of me taking
a big risk in New York

113
00:05:12,181 --> 00:05:14,966
was knowing that Mom's studio
was always an option.Mm.

114
00:05:15,010 --> 00:05:18,230
Well, I did fight very hard
to get them to cut the budget,

115
00:05:18,274 --> 00:05:19,449
you know, anywhere else.

116
00:05:20,885 --> 00:05:22,322
And I just didn't
have the numbers.

117
00:05:23,279 --> 00:05:26,064
Oh... yeah.

118
00:05:26,108 --> 00:05:28,415
I've got to deliver
these Christmas ornaments

119
00:05:28,457 --> 00:05:30,460
to Carl's Tavern for
Saturday night trivia.

120
00:05:30,504 --> 00:05:33,202
You know what, Dad, I'll just
take these on my way home.

121
00:05:33,245 --> 00:05:34,421
Really? Yeah.

122
00:05:34,464 --> 00:05:35,770
Oh, that'd be
great. Thank you.

123
00:05:35,813 --> 00:05:37,467
Oh, I forgot...

124
00:05:37,511 --> 00:05:41,384
Darlene made you a box of
her sugar plum cookies.

125
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:43,517
Your favorite.

126
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:44,822
Oh, thank you.

127
00:05:46,041 --> 00:05:47,608
Yeah, that's very sweet of her.

128
00:05:47,651 --> 00:05:49,174
You guys see a
lot of each other?

129
00:05:49,218 --> 00:05:51,002
No, uh...

130
00:05:51,046 --> 00:05:53,396
No, I mean, I sort
of barely know her.

131
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:55,659
I see her around,
on the council.

132
00:05:55,703 --> 00:05:57,313
Can I give you a hand
with these boxes?

133
00:05:57,357 --> 00:06:00,838
Dad, I'm a professional fitness
instructor. Yeah.

134
00:06:00,882 --> 00:06:03,188
I think I can carry some boxes.

135
00:06:03,232 --> 00:06:06,714
Ahh! See ya
later. See ya.

136
00:06:13,111 --> 00:06:14,112
Oh!

137
00:06:19,379 --> 00:06:21,598
- Merry Christmas!
- Merry Christmas!

138
00:06:24,253 --> 00:06:25,254
Oh! Oh!

139
00:06:26,124 --> 00:06:27,387
Oh, gosh.

140
00:06:27,430 --> 00:06:29,389
Are you okay?
Yeah. Are you okay?

141
00:06:33,088 --> 00:06:35,395
Why are you
carrying around a box of dirt?

142
00:06:35,438 --> 00:06:36,918
It's not dirt, it's poinsettias.

143
00:06:36,961 --> 00:06:38,267
Did you not see me?

144
00:06:38,310 --> 00:06:40,922
"Poinsett-ia." "Poinsett-ia."
No, I did see you.

145
00:06:40,965 --> 00:06:42,532
I was looking at my phone.

146
00:06:42,576 --> 00:06:43,857
I think it's you
that didn't see me

147
00:06:43,881 --> 00:06:45,840
'cause you're carrying
this tower of junk.

148
00:06:45,883 --> 00:06:48,277
It's not junk. It's
Christmas decorations.

149
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:49,974
Well...

150
00:06:50,018 --> 00:06:51,846
Potato, potato.

151
00:06:51,889 --> 00:06:54,544
Well, junk implies that
it's useless or trash

152
00:06:54,588 --> 00:06:57,242
and these are items
that bring people joy

153
00:06:57,286 --> 00:06:59,419
and trust me, we all need
a little joy right now.

154
00:06:59,462 --> 00:07:00,855
Oh... Oh, what's this?

155
00:07:00,898 --> 00:07:05,860
Let me guess...
Overpriced artificial holly.

156
00:07:05,903 --> 00:07:11,169
Careful, this is mistletoe.
Not to be messed with.

157
00:07:11,213 --> 00:07:13,911
Overly-passionate about
Christmas decor, noted.

158
00:07:15,086 --> 00:07:16,957
You know, I'm sorry
I bumped into you

159
00:07:17,001 --> 00:07:18,829
but, uh, a little
advice... Mm-hmm?

160
00:07:18,873 --> 00:07:21,789
This town is called
Mistletoe for a reason.

161
00:07:21,832 --> 00:07:23,747
Ah.We're a Christmas oasis.

162
00:07:25,488 --> 00:07:26,900
If you don't like the
holiday I'd hit the road.

163
00:07:26,924 --> 00:07:28,578
Whoa, whoa. Hit the road?

164
00:07:28,622 --> 00:07:30,798
Does Santa know that
you talk like that?

165
00:07:30,841 --> 00:07:32,471
I never told you I
don't like the holidays.

166
00:07:32,495 --> 00:07:33,931
In fact, I love it.

167
00:07:33,975 --> 00:07:36,412
I applaud the commercial
genius that is Christmas.

168
00:07:36,456 --> 00:07:39,241
The best parts of
Christmas are priceless.

169
00:07:39,284 --> 00:07:41,025
Now why does that
sound familiar?

170
00:07:41,069 --> 00:07:42,244
It's a commercial.

171
00:07:43,811 --> 00:07:44,899
I have to go.

172
00:07:46,857 --> 00:07:48,119
Far away from you.

173
00:07:49,164 --> 00:07:50,165
Merry Christmas!

174
00:08:29,857 --> 00:08:30,945
Hey.

175
00:08:30,988 --> 00:08:32,860
I know. I know
we said no calls.

176
00:08:32,903 --> 00:08:35,297
I just wanted to make
sure you got in okay.

177
00:08:35,905 --> 00:08:37,342
I did, thanks.

178
00:08:37,385 --> 00:08:38,996
Good. Listen, you, uh...

179
00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:41,303
you tell your dad I
say hi, all right?

180
00:08:41,346 --> 00:08:43,174
Bradley, being on a break means

181
00:08:43,217 --> 00:08:45,133
I don't tell my dad you say hi.

182
00:08:45,176 --> 00:08:46,438
Right, that makes sense.

183
00:08:48,484 --> 00:08:49,659
Are we sure about this?

184
00:08:49,703 --> 00:08:52,488
I feel like we might
be overreacting.

185
00:08:52,532 --> 00:08:55,012
Well, what's the
proper way to react

186
00:08:55,056 --> 00:08:57,580
when your boyfriend wants
to put things on hold?

187
00:08:57,624 --> 00:09:00,061
No, no. I never said
let's put us on hold.

188
00:09:00,104 --> 00:09:03,673
I just felt like getting engaged
right now was... reckless.

189
00:09:03,717 --> 00:09:05,327
Reckless?

190
00:09:05,370 --> 00:09:08,243
We always said we wanted to
be engaged by this Christmas

191
00:09:08,286 --> 00:09:10,462
and then you suddenly
changed your mind.

192
00:09:10,506 --> 00:09:11,946
That was before we
lost the gym. I...

193
00:09:12,813 --> 00:09:15,903
I'm sorry. I didn't
call to fight, okay?

194
00:09:15,946 --> 00:09:20,168
I... I just really
miss you. I miss us.

195
00:09:21,691 --> 00:09:22,997
I miss that, too.

196
00:09:24,738 --> 00:09:27,305
But I really feel
like being apart...

197
00:09:28,959 --> 00:09:32,702
taking this time is the
right reset we both need.

198
00:09:34,356 --> 00:09:36,184
Yeah. If you say so.

199
00:09:39,013 --> 00:09:40,362
Good night, Bradley.

200
00:09:42,973 --> 00:09:44,018
Bye, Audrey.

201
00:09:57,640 --> 00:09:59,294
You look
exactly the same.

202
00:10:01,426 --> 00:10:02,427
Look at this.

203
00:10:04,038 --> 00:10:06,214
I got nostalgic while
decorating last night.

204
00:10:06,257 --> 00:10:07,476
Oh.

205
00:10:07,519 --> 00:10:09,434
Look at us in our little tutus.

206
00:10:10,958 --> 00:10:13,700
Didn't we insist on rainbow
frill for, like, four years?

207
00:10:13,743 --> 00:10:15,503
Your mom joked we'd be
going to prom in them.

208
00:10:15,527 --> 00:10:16,964
Mm-hmm. Oh, gosh.

209
00:10:17,007 --> 00:10:20,271
I keep thinking what she'd
say about this place closing.

210
00:10:20,315 --> 00:10:23,318
Yeah. This place means
so much to so many.

211
00:10:25,146 --> 00:10:27,427
Though not everyone can say
they had their first kiss here.

212
00:10:28,540 --> 00:10:29,672
I totally forgot!

213
00:10:29,716 --> 00:10:32,240
Dante Fitzpatrick
after dance class.

214
00:10:32,283 --> 00:10:35,896
I... I think you were the first
and last girl he ever kissed.

215
00:10:35,939 --> 00:10:37,898
Oh, gosh.

216
00:10:37,941 --> 00:10:39,223
Wait a minute, what are
you doing here so early?

217
00:10:39,247 --> 00:10:40,964
I didn't think you had
a class this morning.

218
00:10:40,988 --> 00:10:43,077
Somebody booked a
private session.

219
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:44,600
I put a link up on my stories

220
00:10:44,644 --> 00:10:47,342
saying I'd be back at home
teaching, filled right up.

221
00:10:47,385 --> 00:10:48,909
You sound surprised.

222
00:10:48,952 --> 00:10:51,040
Oh, let's just say
I have a little PTSD

223
00:10:51,085 --> 00:10:53,609
from the lack of attendance
at the New York City gym.

224
00:10:53,653 --> 00:10:57,221
Hm. Well, here, you're
appreciated and loved.

225
00:10:58,135 --> 00:10:59,223
Thanks, Lisa.

226
00:11:02,139 --> 00:11:04,054
Good morning! Are
you here for your...

227
00:11:05,621 --> 00:11:07,362
You?

228
00:11:07,405 --> 00:11:09,146
You're my private session?

229
00:11:09,190 --> 00:11:10,495
Man, this is a small town.

230
00:11:10,539 --> 00:11:11,932
I had no idea that
you worked here.

231
00:11:11,975 --> 00:11:13,387
You see, when I'm on
the road traveling,

232
00:11:13,411 --> 00:11:14,935
I never wanna miss a workout.

233
00:11:14,978 --> 00:11:17,502
Our inn has no gym, so
Darlene down at the bakery,

234
00:11:17,546 --> 00:11:20,636
she said the very best instructor
she's ever had is back in town.

235
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:22,092
She signed me up. I'm
assuming that's you.

236
00:11:22,116 --> 00:11:23,683
Yep. That's me.

237
00:11:23,726 --> 00:11:25,641
Wow. Modest, too.

238
00:11:25,685 --> 00:11:27,077
So what are we looking at here?

239
00:11:27,121 --> 00:11:29,645
Some weights? Some plates?
These are terrible by the way.

240
00:11:29,689 --> 00:11:30,907
Dance.

241
00:11:32,387 --> 00:11:35,259
No, no. Darlene said you
were a fitness instructor.

242
00:11:35,303 --> 00:11:37,653
I am. I teach
dance-based fitness.

243
00:11:37,697 --> 00:11:40,700
My routines involve a lot
of cardio and coordination.

244
00:11:40,743 --> 00:11:43,180
Ew... like dance for fitness?

245
00:11:43,224 --> 00:11:44,660
Trust me, it gets intense.

246
00:11:45,226 --> 00:11:46,357
I do cross-fit.

247
00:11:46,401 --> 00:11:48,098
Some side shuffle's
not gonna cut it.

248
00:11:48,142 --> 00:11:49,709
We'll see.Okay.

249
00:11:53,234 --> 00:11:55,453
Ooh. Christmas music?

250
00:11:55,497 --> 00:11:58,239
Starting November 1st,
it's the only thing I play.

251
00:11:58,282 --> 00:12:00,241
You ready? Okay.

252
00:12:01,024 --> 00:12:02,373
It's a simple routine.

253
00:12:02,417 --> 00:12:04,767
You start on the right
foot, single, single.

254
00:12:04,811 --> 00:12:07,204
Double on the
right, left, right,

255
00:12:07,248 --> 00:12:08,379
and a double on the left.

256
00:12:08,423 --> 00:12:09,946
You want me to do that?

257
00:12:09,990 --> 00:12:12,601
Well, you do cross-fit, right?
Surely this will be easy.

258
00:12:12,644 --> 00:12:14,690
Six, seven, eight!
Single! Single!

259
00:12:14,734 --> 00:12:16,083
Double!

260
00:12:16,126 --> 00:12:18,476
Single, single,
double kick right!

261
00:12:18,520 --> 00:12:21,262
A kick, kick, kick! Kick,
kick, out and right!

262
00:12:22,785 --> 00:12:25,396
Right leg for
four, three, two...

263
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:28,443
Left, four, three,
two, step touch.

264
00:12:28,486 --> 00:12:32,012
And a-one and a-two and
a-three and a-four and a twist.

265
00:12:32,055 --> 00:12:35,406
And a-one, two,
three, whoo! Whoo...

266
00:12:35,450 --> 00:12:39,454
Okay. I think that's
enough for today.

267
00:12:39,497 --> 00:12:42,718
You hear that? That is the sweet
sound of no more Christmas music.

268
00:12:42,762 --> 00:12:44,938
Well, you sure picked the
wrong town to vacation in

269
00:12:44,981 --> 00:12:46,461
if you don't like Christmas.

270
00:12:46,504 --> 00:12:48,289
Oh, no, no, no. I'm, uh...

271
00:12:48,332 --> 00:12:50,465
I'm not on vacation. This
is strictly business for me.

272
00:12:50,508 --> 00:12:52,293
Wait, Darlene said
you're back in town.

273
00:12:52,336 --> 00:12:53,468
What does she mean by that?

274
00:12:53,511 --> 00:12:54,991
Oh, I grew up in Mistletoe

275
00:12:55,035 --> 00:12:57,820
and then, after college, came
back here and taught classes.

276
00:12:57,864 --> 00:13:00,170
But it was always my dream
to open a gym in New York

277
00:13:00,214 --> 00:13:02,303
so for the last couple
years that's what I did.

278
00:13:02,346 --> 00:13:05,175
Oh, so you're basically
home for the holidays then.

279
00:13:05,219 --> 00:13:07,395
Well, something like that.

280
00:13:07,438 --> 00:13:10,528
You know, my private sessions
are for more advanced levels.

281
00:13:10,572 --> 00:13:12,922
You might do better in
one of my group classes.

282
00:13:13,836 --> 00:13:15,838
Okay, I'll think about that.

283
00:13:15,882 --> 00:13:17,797
You really got my heart rate up.

284
00:13:18,580 --> 00:13:19,581
Nice grip.

285
00:13:20,669 --> 00:13:21,975
Mm.

286
00:13:22,018 --> 00:13:23,063
Bye.Bye.

287
00:13:27,545 --> 00:13:29,852
I know. We'll
talk.

288
00:13:30,722 --> 00:13:32,724
Welcome everyone, welcome.

289
00:13:32,768 --> 00:13:35,118
Uh, Darlene, I believe you
wanted to kick things off.

290
00:13:35,162 --> 00:13:38,295
I... I just wanted
to remind everyone

291
00:13:38,339 --> 00:13:43,344
that the last ever rec center Christmas
party will be on Christmas Eve.

292
00:13:44,736 --> 00:13:48,653
Everyone is invited.
Good drinks, great music.

293
00:13:49,872 --> 00:13:51,352
Thank you, Darlene.

294
00:13:51,395 --> 00:13:53,615
You'd better believe
I'll be there.

295
00:13:53,658 --> 00:13:56,400
So I know the closing
of the rec center

296
00:13:56,444 --> 00:13:58,011
has been hard on all of us.

297
00:13:58,054 --> 00:14:00,535
I just wanna remind
everybody that this meeting

298
00:14:00,578 --> 00:14:03,930
is to hear ideas about what
should happen to the building

299
00:14:03,973 --> 00:14:07,063
and of course, that
includes Mount Mistletoe.

300
00:14:07,107 --> 00:14:12,155
Uh... the final vote
will be on December 23rd.

301
00:14:12,199 --> 00:14:16,246
And that is just before the council
adjourns for the Christmas holidays.

302
00:14:17,030 --> 00:14:18,596
You again?

303
00:14:18,640 --> 00:14:20,598
Okay, this is coming
close to stalking.

304
00:14:20,642 --> 00:14:22,122
A tad presumptuous,
don't you think?

305
00:14:22,165 --> 00:14:23,485
Thinking I came
here just for you.

306
00:14:23,514 --> 00:14:24,951
What are you doing here then?

307
00:14:24,994 --> 00:14:27,605
Well, isn't the
whole town invited?

308
00:14:27,649 --> 00:14:30,043
Everyone who lives in Mistletoe.

309
00:14:30,086 --> 00:14:32,784
Don't you technically
live in New York?

310
00:14:32,828 --> 00:14:34,632
"Don't you
technically live in New York?"

311
00:14:34,656 --> 00:14:39,139
First, the council recognizes
Griffin Weston from Skyridge Resorts.

312
00:14:39,182 --> 00:14:41,402
That's my cue.
Watch my jacket.

313
00:14:44,579 --> 00:14:46,363
He's the resort guy?

314
00:14:46,407 --> 00:14:47,582
Do you know him?

315
00:14:47,625 --> 00:14:49,540
He was my private
session this morning.

316
00:14:49,584 --> 00:14:52,369
Conveniently didn't
mention why he was in town.

317
00:14:54,154 --> 00:14:58,549
Mistletoe is such a
charming little town.

318
00:14:58,593 --> 00:15:02,031
A Christmas oasis,
if you will.

319
00:15:03,424 --> 00:15:08,472
Imagine a place where you
can eat the best food,

320
00:15:08,516 --> 00:15:10,126
drink the best wine

321
00:15:10,170 --> 00:15:13,477
and get the most relaxing
massage of your life.

322
00:15:13,521 --> 00:15:18,265
And at this place, imagine
a ski slope so smooth,

323
00:15:18,308 --> 00:15:20,397
so serene, that
as you're flying,

324
00:15:20,441 --> 00:15:21,703
the wind's blowing by you,

325
00:15:21,746 --> 00:15:25,402
you have to ask yourself,
"Am I actually flying?"

326
00:15:25,446 --> 00:15:28,579
That place is called
Skyridge Resort.

327
00:15:29,624 --> 00:15:31,278
People can't be buying this.

328
00:15:31,321 --> 00:15:33,933
And that dream could
become a reality in Mistletoe.

329
00:15:35,456 --> 00:15:36,631
Jackie, right?

330
00:15:36,674 --> 00:15:37,806
Do you ski?

331
00:15:37,849 --> 00:15:39,112
I love to ski.

332
00:15:39,155 --> 00:15:40,678
Takes one to snow one.

333
00:15:40,722 --> 00:15:42,898
Powder to the people.

334
00:15:42,942 --> 00:15:45,857
Oh, wow. Can you help me?

335
00:15:45,901 --> 00:15:47,424
Where is the closest
hill to here?

336
00:15:47,947 --> 00:15:49,252
An hour away.

337
00:15:49,296 --> 00:15:52,821
An hour away. Not anymore.

338
00:15:53,474 --> 00:15:54,954
Not anymore.

339
00:15:56,651 --> 00:16:00,220
It is hard that
your rec center is closing.

340
00:16:00,263 --> 00:16:01,438
But you have to ask yourself,

341
00:16:01,482 --> 00:16:03,963
do you want this place
to just sit here empty,

342
00:16:04,006 --> 00:16:07,792
unloved, unappreciated.

343
00:16:07,836 --> 00:16:09,055
And the worst case scenario,

344
00:16:09,098 --> 00:16:11,187
a big box store comes
in and just

345
00:16:11,231 --> 00:16:12,493
makes themselves at home

346
00:16:12,536 --> 00:16:14,451
right here in your little town.

347
00:16:14,495 --> 00:16:19,239
So you can have that or
this in your backyard.

348
00:16:21,415 --> 00:16:22,590
Skyridge.

349
00:16:24,505 --> 00:16:27,551
No way are they bulldozing
our beautiful center

350
00:16:27,595 --> 00:16:31,294
for those fake cobblestone walkways
and paint-by-numbers hotels.

351
00:16:31,338 --> 00:16:33,165
We might not have a choice.

352
00:16:33,209 --> 00:16:35,995
Not in this town.
Not at Christmas.

353
00:16:38,127 --> 00:16:42,566
I'll stop him. One
way or another.

354
00:16:46,005 --> 00:16:47,765
I don't know, maybe the
dentist on Main Street

355
00:16:47,789 --> 00:16:50,270
would rent us the back
half of his building?

356
00:16:50,313 --> 00:16:52,315
Isn't coffee not
great for teeth?

357
00:16:52,359 --> 00:16:55,275
Oh... mutually
beneficial business then?

358
00:16:55,318 --> 00:16:58,843
Which reminds me.
Tonight, bottle of wine?

359
00:16:58,887 --> 00:16:59,975
Finally some free time?

360
00:17:00,019 --> 00:17:02,282
Hey... Oh, shoot.

361
00:17:02,325 --> 00:17:05,936
I forgot I volunteered for the library
toy drive tonight. Tomorrow then.

362
00:17:05,981 --> 00:17:07,654
Oh, no, wait, no, wait, we
can't. That's trivia night.

363
00:17:07,678 --> 00:17:08,810
Hmm.

364
00:17:08,853 --> 00:17:10,092
When did our lives get so crazy?

365
00:17:10,116 --> 00:17:11,551
Pretty much the second

366
00:17:11,595 --> 00:17:14,076
we decided to start trying
for a baby. Mm.

367
00:17:16,644 --> 00:17:18,298
Good morning.

368
00:17:18,340 --> 00:17:19,603
Three extra shots of espresso

369
00:17:19,646 --> 00:17:21,040
in my gingerbread latte, please.

370
00:17:21,083 --> 00:17:22,954
Also, a blueberry scone.

371
00:17:22,998 --> 00:17:25,150
You stopped ordering the ones with
the gross lemon zest in them, right?

372
00:17:25,174 --> 00:17:28,525
Yes, after your fifth rant,
I switched up my order.

373
00:17:28,569 --> 00:17:31,180
Good. I need sugar and
caffeine. I was up all night.

374
00:17:31,224 --> 00:17:34,183
Then why do you look so upbeat?

375
00:17:34,227 --> 00:17:35,358
I figured it out.

376
00:17:36,359 --> 00:17:38,013
How we save the rec center.

377
00:17:38,057 --> 00:17:39,971
I was up studying
the town's budgets.

378
00:17:40,015 --> 00:17:42,583
Technically, we
only need $80,000

379
00:17:42,626 --> 00:17:44,498
to keep this place
open for another year.

380
00:17:44,541 --> 00:17:47,196
That buys us time to find
a more permanent solution.

381
00:17:47,240 --> 00:17:49,981
Only? That is a lot of money.

382
00:17:50,025 --> 00:17:51,505
So we raise the money.

383
00:17:51,548 --> 00:17:54,421
Well, they're voting
on it December 23rd.

384
00:17:54,464 --> 00:17:55,987
That's, like, in two weeks.

385
00:17:56,031 --> 00:17:59,165
I know it seems impossible,
but if I can figure out a way

386
00:17:59,208 --> 00:18:01,080
for people to donate the money

387
00:18:01,123 --> 00:18:02,690
then the town won't
have to sell the land

388
00:18:02,733 --> 00:18:04,431
to that awful resort guy.

389
00:18:04,474 --> 00:18:05,562
Oh, I hate that guy.

390
00:18:06,694 --> 00:18:09,523
What are
you doing here?

391
00:18:09,566 --> 00:18:11,327
Grabbing myself a cup of
coffee on my way to class.

392
00:18:11,351 --> 00:18:13,353
Black, no room, please.

393
00:18:13,396 --> 00:18:14,676
Oh, you sure you don't wanna try

394
00:18:14,702 --> 00:18:16,549
one of our gingerbread
lattes? They're really good.

395
00:18:16,573 --> 00:18:18,793
Sounds a little too...

396
00:18:18,836 --> 00:18:19,924
Christmassy?

397
00:18:19,968 --> 00:18:22,405
Sugary. But... but,
yeah, that, too.

398
00:18:22,449 --> 00:18:24,799
What do you mean "picking
up a coffee before class"?

399
00:18:24,842 --> 00:18:26,801
Well, my "fitness instructor"

400
00:18:26,844 --> 00:18:30,283
said that I should stick
to group lessons, so...

401
00:18:30,326 --> 00:18:32,067
I also hear that
Darlene might be there

402
00:18:32,111 --> 00:18:33,547
and I may need her vote.

403
00:18:33,590 --> 00:18:36,376
Oh. Well, you'll be
"wasting your breath."

404
00:18:36,419 --> 00:18:37,812
She knows what a
resort like yours

405
00:18:37,855 --> 00:18:39,422
can do to a town like ours.

406
00:18:39,466 --> 00:18:40,771
Improve it?

407
00:18:40,815 --> 00:18:42,251
Ruin it.

408
00:18:42,295 --> 00:18:44,384
Oh, look at the time. I
should probably get going.

409
00:18:44,427 --> 00:18:46,603
Don't wanna be late, get
on my teacher's bad side.

410
00:18:47,648 --> 00:18:49,040
Thank you.
Delicious.

411
00:18:50,694 --> 00:18:53,088
Jimmy? Lise? For the Gram?

412
00:18:54,220 --> 00:18:55,220
Thanks so much.

413
00:18:56,918 --> 00:18:58,963
I can't stand that guy.

414
00:18:59,007 --> 00:19:00,443
I don't know, seems kinda cool.

415
00:19:00,487 --> 00:19:02,967
I really like the
scarf that he's got...

416
00:19:03,011 --> 00:19:05,492
Oh, yeah, no, I get it.
We don't like that guy.

417
00:19:06,057 --> 00:19:07,058
No, Jim.

418
00:19:07,929 --> 00:19:09,191
You forgot your scone!

419
00:19:10,410 --> 00:19:13,108
Mount Mistletoe has
perfect untapped terrain

420
00:19:13,152 --> 00:19:14,588
for prime skiing. Look it.

421
00:19:14,631 --> 00:19:15,806
Yeah.Yeah.

422
00:19:15,850 --> 00:19:17,895
Not much of a skier.Oh.

423
00:19:17,939 --> 00:19:19,984
I, on the other
hand, love to shred.

424
00:19:20,028 --> 00:19:21,116
Is that right? Yeah.

425
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:23,031
Snowboarding. You
look like you shred.

426
00:19:23,074 --> 00:19:24,554
So here's what
you're gonna like.

427
00:19:24,598 --> 00:19:26,861
Right there is a terrain
park on the bottom.

428
00:19:26,904 --> 00:19:28,558
Hey, oh, Carl, didn't
you break your arm

429
00:19:28,602 --> 00:19:29,951
three times snowboarding?

430
00:19:29,994 --> 00:19:32,171
Well, it was four, but
it was totally worth it.

431
00:19:32,214 --> 00:19:33,607
Oh, that is the spirit.

432
00:19:33,650 --> 00:19:35,435
Nothing is gonna
keep you down, is it?

433
00:19:35,478 --> 00:19:37,959
Black diamond for you.
And come to think...

434
00:19:38,002 --> 00:19:40,135
And I think it's time we
start warming up for class.

435
00:19:40,179 --> 00:19:42,224
Okay, everybody,
let's get going.

436
00:19:42,268 --> 00:19:45,706
The black diamond, is there
a lot of trees going down?

437
00:19:45,749 --> 00:19:48,012
Yeah, but they're spaced
out and it's fluffy snow.

438
00:19:48,056 --> 00:19:49,884
Hey, everybody.

439
00:19:49,927 --> 00:19:51,277
So, as you can see,

440
00:19:51,320 --> 00:19:54,932
Mr. Resort has decided to
join us for class today.

441
00:19:54,976 --> 00:19:57,326
Most people
call me Griffin. Hi, everybody.

442
00:19:57,370 --> 00:19:59,110
Thank you for the introduction.

443
00:19:59,154 --> 00:20:00,199
I can't wait to dance

444
00:20:00,242 --> 00:20:02,549
in the Christmas
capital of the world.

445
00:20:02,592 --> 00:20:04,638
Oh, you're a big fan
of Christmas, huh?

446
00:20:04,681 --> 00:20:06,248
The biggest.

447
00:20:06,292 --> 00:20:09,512
Oh, tell me, what's your
favorite part about Christmas?

448
00:20:09,556 --> 00:20:12,167
Well, it's... I'd have to go
with the joy that it brings.

449
00:20:12,211 --> 00:20:15,562
That's a little vague.
Can you be more specific?

450
00:20:16,215 --> 00:20:17,433
Uh, yeah, sure.

451
00:20:18,304 --> 00:20:19,783
Music. How about... The music.

452
00:20:19,827 --> 00:20:21,176
- The music?
- Yeah.

453
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:23,439
Oh, well what's your
favorite Christmas carol?

454
00:20:23,483 --> 00:20:25,615
Ooh, I have to pick just one?

455
00:20:25,659 --> 00:20:27,487
I'd say, The Twelve
Days Of Christmas.

456
00:20:27,530 --> 00:20:29,010
Oh, I love that one, too.

457
00:20:29,053 --> 00:20:32,056
Oh, remind me, what did they
bring on the second day?

458
00:20:32,100 --> 00:20:33,232
Oh, that's, um...

459
00:20:34,972 --> 00:20:36,060
Turtles.

460
00:20:38,237 --> 00:20:39,890
Turtles? Yeah. Turtles... No?

461
00:20:39,934 --> 00:20:42,284
Doves, doves.Swans.

462
00:20:42,328 --> 00:20:43,503
Swans?

463
00:20:43,546 --> 00:20:45,896
Turtle... turtle
swans. Turtle swans?

464
00:20:45,940 --> 00:20:48,334
Yeah. Okay, everybody,
let's pick up the pace.

465
00:20:55,384 --> 00:20:56,690
You're kidding.

466
00:20:56,733 --> 00:20:58,518
So you melt the butter first?

467
00:20:58,561 --> 00:21:00,781
Yes. That's what
gives it the texture.

468
00:21:00,824 --> 00:21:02,173
No. I had no idea.

469
00:21:02,217 --> 00:21:04,480
You're really
this interested in baking?

470
00:21:04,524 --> 00:21:07,004
Well, mostly the eating, but
you gotta start somewhere.

471
00:21:07,048 --> 00:21:08,484
Mm-hmm.

472
00:21:08,528 --> 00:21:09,888
Oh, excuse me.

473
00:21:12,401 --> 00:21:14,577
I gotta take this. We
will talk baking later.

474
00:21:14,621 --> 00:21:15,665
Anytime.

475
00:21:15,709 --> 00:21:18,015
Okay. Bye, Darlene. Ciao.

476
00:21:19,190 --> 00:21:20,322
Hello?

477
00:21:20,366 --> 00:21:21,430
So, talk to me, Griffin.

478
00:21:21,454 --> 00:21:23,586
When can we expect
to break ground?

479
00:21:23,630 --> 00:21:26,197
Soon. Very soon.

480
00:21:26,241 --> 00:21:28,635
That's not very specific.
Should I be worried?

481
00:21:28,678 --> 00:21:30,854
When have I ever
let you down, Dad?

482
00:21:30,898 --> 00:21:32,856
Town council votes
on the 23rd December.

483
00:21:32,900 --> 00:21:34,220
That still gives
us a couple weeks

484
00:21:34,249 --> 00:21:35,400
to make sure they
don't choose to do

485
00:21:35,424 --> 00:21:36,904
anything else with the property.

486
00:21:36,947 --> 00:21:38,688
Expect any opposition?

487
00:21:38,732 --> 00:21:40,473
Nothing I can't handle.

488
00:21:40,516 --> 00:21:42,736
That's my boy, chip
off the old block.

489
00:21:42,779 --> 00:21:44,303
Keep me updated, will you?

490
00:21:44,346 --> 00:21:46,217
Okay. Well, talk to you soon.

491
00:21:50,004 --> 00:21:52,615
If you follow Main Street
all the way to its end,

492
00:21:52,659 --> 00:21:55,183
you'll find the beating
heart of our community.

493
00:21:55,226 --> 00:21:57,359
Originally built as the
town founder's home,

494
00:21:57,403 --> 00:22:01,407
it was converted into a
recreation center in 1954.

495
00:22:01,450 --> 00:22:03,234
Is this... is this
your audition tape

496
00:22:03,278 --> 00:22:04,888
for the History Channel?

497
00:22:04,932 --> 00:22:08,109
We're encouraging people to
donate to save the center.

498
00:22:08,152 --> 00:22:11,721
Wait, you're straight up just
asking people for money in a video?

499
00:22:11,765 --> 00:22:13,462
Do you need
something? No, sorry.

500
00:22:13,506 --> 00:22:16,160
Don't mind me, I'm just,
uh, grabbing some photos,

501
00:22:16,204 --> 00:22:18,051
so our marketing team can
hit the ground running.

502
00:22:18,075 --> 00:22:19,355
You have a little
something there.

503
00:22:19,381 --> 00:22:21,775
Thank you. Just ignore
him and keep going.

504
00:22:21,818 --> 00:22:23,472
Okay.Okay.

505
00:22:23,516 --> 00:22:25,822
Not only can you find
an array of classes

506
00:22:25,866 --> 00:22:28,172
like foreign languages,
ceramics, painting,

507
00:22:28,216 --> 00:22:30,044
but also an art gallery,

508
00:22:30,087 --> 00:22:34,091
and of course, my favorite,
a dance and fitness studio.

509
00:22:34,135 --> 00:22:36,180
Wait, Lisa, do you think
that I should talk about

510
00:22:36,224 --> 00:22:39,706
the donate page before I mention
everything that we offer?

511
00:22:39,749 --> 00:22:41,969
Yeah, probably.

512
00:22:42,012 --> 00:22:44,643
Otherwise, it just looks like you're making
a fan video for a building, and that's...

513
00:22:44,667 --> 00:22:46,993
Wait, why are you doing this
video here and not the rec center?

514
00:22:47,017 --> 00:22:49,846
Because... We're gonna edit
that in with Audrey talking.

515
00:22:49,890 --> 00:22:50,978
Mm.

516
00:22:51,021 --> 00:22:53,067
Okay, let's go again.Yeah.

517
00:22:53,110 --> 00:22:54,610
This time, say the donate
now page at the top.

518
00:22:54,634 --> 00:22:56,157
Okay. Okay.Yeah.

519
00:22:56,200 --> 00:22:57,613
Wait a sec, did you say
"donate now"? No, no, no, no.

520
00:22:57,637 --> 00:22:59,310
They give the money back
if you don't hit your goal.

521
00:22:59,334 --> 00:23:00,379
We're meeting our goal.

522
00:23:00,422 --> 00:23:01,989
Okay. How's your frame?

523
00:23:03,599 --> 00:23:05,645
You wanna make sure you
get the whole shot in

524
00:23:05,688 --> 00:23:08,169
so that way that we can really
emphasize the ski resort,

525
00:23:08,212 --> 00:23:11,651
and people can see the
full potential of it, yeah.

526
00:23:11,694 --> 00:23:12,956
Lisa, I'm done.

527
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:14,784
We're moving inside
the rec center.

528
00:23:14,828 --> 00:23:15,872
Let's go.

529
00:23:23,793 --> 00:23:25,316
Don't stay up too
late, sweetheart.

530
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:27,101
You know the old saying.

531
00:23:27,144 --> 00:23:29,233
A watched donation
site never boils

532
00:23:29,277 --> 00:23:31,975
or, you know,
something like that.

533
00:23:32,019 --> 00:23:35,631
I have to figure out a way to reach
more people if this is gonna work.

534
00:23:35,675 --> 00:23:37,328
Everything I've read
online says that

535
00:23:37,372 --> 00:23:40,636
the first two hours after a post
goes up are the most important.

536
00:23:41,463 --> 00:23:42,812
But at this rate

537
00:23:42,856 --> 00:23:44,727
it's gonna take me a
decade to save the center.

538
00:23:44,771 --> 00:23:47,469
Well, it's a lot of money to
be raised in a short time.

539
00:23:47,513 --> 00:23:50,690
Maybe I'm
fooling myself.

540
00:23:50,733 --> 00:23:53,170
If I couldn't save my gym,
how can I save the center?

541
00:23:55,042 --> 00:23:57,305
It's just everything I thought
my life would be by now

542
00:23:57,348 --> 00:23:58,524
hasn't happened.

543
00:24:00,308 --> 00:24:02,528
I thought I at
least could do this.

544
00:24:02,571 --> 00:24:04,399
Well, you know what
your mom would say.

545
00:24:04,443 --> 00:24:06,421
She'd say if everything's not going
exactly the way you want it to,

546
00:24:06,445 --> 00:24:08,664
there's usually something
better around the corner.

547
00:24:08,708 --> 00:24:10,492
Good night.

548
00:24:20,589 --> 00:24:22,417
You picked the perfect tree.

549
00:24:23,026 --> 00:24:24,201
And don't forget,

550
00:24:24,245 --> 00:24:25,376
sign up on the donation page

551
00:24:25,420 --> 00:24:26,943
to help save the rec center.

552
00:24:38,259 --> 00:24:39,521
Bradley. Hi.

553
00:24:40,609 --> 00:24:42,219
Are you ready for
some amazing news?

554
00:24:42,263 --> 00:24:44,091
I think so?

555
00:24:44,134 --> 00:24:46,702
I just had a meeting
with Susan Price.

556
00:24:46,746 --> 00:24:49,313
The head of New York
Solis Fitness Clubs?

557
00:24:49,357 --> 00:24:51,141
Yes. She took one
of our classes

558
00:24:51,185 --> 00:24:52,534
back in the day if you remember,

559
00:24:52,578 --> 00:24:56,451
when we first opened, and,
she liked what she saw.

560
00:24:56,495 --> 00:24:58,235
Audrey, she wants to
hire the both of us

561
00:24:58,279 --> 00:25:00,499
to teach at her Solis
Fitness Club in Soho.

562
00:25:00,542 --> 00:25:01,717
You're kidding.

563
00:25:01,761 --> 00:25:03,632
No. She loves our energy.

564
00:25:03,676 --> 00:25:04,957
We'd fit right into
their structure.

565
00:25:04,981 --> 00:25:06,655
She even wants us to
start in the new year.

566
00:25:06,679 --> 00:25:08,158
Can you believe it?

567
00:25:08,202 --> 00:25:11,684
You and I working for one of
the biggest fitness empires

568
00:25:11,727 --> 00:25:12,772
in the world.

569
00:25:12,815 --> 00:25:14,425
That's amazing.

570
00:25:15,862 --> 00:25:18,212
We wouldn't have much
freedom with what we taught.

571
00:25:18,255 --> 00:25:20,823
Um, yeah, you're right.

572
00:25:20,867 --> 00:25:25,175
But the truth is, you know,
boutique fitness clubs

573
00:25:25,219 --> 00:25:26,873
are not exactly
thriving right now

574
00:25:26,916 --> 00:25:28,570
and we had to learn
that the hard way.

575
00:25:28,614 --> 00:25:32,574
So this... this is our
shot at getting back on top

576
00:25:32,618 --> 00:25:34,750
and making it in
New York, together.

577
00:25:36,056 --> 00:25:37,231
Can I think about it?

578
00:25:38,928 --> 00:25:41,496
Absolutely. Yeah.

579
00:25:41,540 --> 00:25:43,387
Maybe we should let her
know soon, though, right?

580
00:25:43,411 --> 00:25:45,631
Totally.

581
00:25:45,674 --> 00:25:48,111
Uh, I have to go.
Can I call you later?

582
00:25:48,155 --> 00:25:51,680
Audrey. Maybe...

583
00:25:51,724 --> 00:25:54,814
maybe this is the
reset we both need.

584
00:26:09,742 --> 00:26:11,352
Need a hand?

585
00:26:11,395 --> 00:26:15,399
Uh, no. Thanks, Darlene.
I got it, I got it.

586
00:26:15,443 --> 00:26:16,487
Oh, okay.

587
00:26:18,838 --> 00:26:23,886
Okay. Carl's best candy
cane martinis, woo-hoo!

588
00:26:23,930 --> 00:26:25,235
Sorry we're late.

589
00:26:25,279 --> 00:26:27,281
Oh, no worries at all.

590
00:26:27,324 --> 00:26:29,718
Oh, we wish that was why,
and we were going to,

591
00:26:29,762 --> 00:26:31,894
but, uh... well, Jim.

592
00:26:31,938 --> 00:26:35,158
Uh, I may or may not have
set off the smoke alarm

593
00:26:35,202 --> 00:26:38,292
trying to surprise Lisa with a
romantic dinner.Oh...

594
00:26:38,335 --> 00:26:40,076
The point is, we're
gonna need some food.

595
00:26:40,120 --> 00:26:41,643
Food. I'll get us
some cheese fries.

596
00:26:41,687 --> 00:26:42,949
Thank you.

597
00:26:42,992 --> 00:26:44,907
Oh! Oh!

598
00:26:44,951 --> 00:26:47,475
Wow. It's a really good
thing that wasn't hot cider.

599
00:26:47,518 --> 00:26:49,564
You've got to be kidding me.

600
00:26:49,608 --> 00:26:51,435
You're here for
Mistletoe trivia night?

601
00:26:51,479 --> 00:26:52,915
Yeah, I'm on Fred
and Margot's team.

602
00:26:55,004 --> 00:26:58,312
Maureen. Fred and
Maureen. You sure?

603
00:26:58,355 --> 00:27:00,464
You realize this is trivia
about the town of Mistletoe?

604
00:27:00,488 --> 00:27:01,768
Something you know
nothing about.

605
00:27:01,794 --> 00:27:03,143
Yeah. Nothing!

606
00:27:03,186 --> 00:27:05,667
Yeah. That's why I'm
on the best team.

607
00:27:05,711 --> 00:27:07,582
It's a strategy.
Are you worried?

608
00:27:07,626 --> 00:27:08,907
You know I think you'll
probably do okay.

609
00:27:08,931 --> 00:27:09,976
You're from here.

610
00:27:10,019 --> 00:27:11,499
You have an open
tab, though, right?

611
00:27:11,542 --> 00:27:14,067
Hey, Carl? Can we get another
one of these on her tab?

612
00:27:14,110 --> 00:27:15,416
Thank you. It's almost gone.

613
00:27:16,069 --> 00:27:17,331
I'm thirsty.

614
00:27:17,374 --> 00:27:20,116
Oh... Do you have a shirt?
Do you have another...

615
00:27:20,160 --> 00:27:21,596
Please. There you go.

616
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:23,772
Thanks C-Town.

617
00:27:25,339 --> 00:27:26,383
Can you believe him?

618
00:27:29,648 --> 00:27:31,171
So, I guess no
cheese fries then.

619
00:27:31,214 --> 00:27:33,652
Who's ready
to use their brains?

620
00:27:33,695 --> 00:27:35,871
Yeah!

621
00:27:36,655 --> 00:27:37,873
Welcome, everyone,

622
00:27:37,917 --> 00:27:41,355
welcome to Mistletoe's
monthly trivia night.

623
00:27:41,398 --> 00:27:42,486
Whoo!

624
00:27:46,055 --> 00:27:49,145
Please write your
answers legibly.

625
00:27:49,189 --> 00:27:52,496
We don't want another
Santa Fanta debacle.

626
00:27:55,412 --> 00:27:56,936
Here we go.

627
00:27:56,979 --> 00:27:59,199
What year did the
town of Mistletoe

628
00:27:59,242 --> 00:28:02,550
eliminate the sales
tax on Christmas trees?

629
00:28:07,773 --> 00:28:09,426
1931 is the correct answer.

630
00:28:14,823 --> 00:28:16,216
Okay,
folks, here we go.

631
00:28:16,259 --> 00:28:18,784
We're coming down to
it, next question.

632
00:28:18,827 --> 00:28:22,701
Phoradendron is the most
common species of mistletoe.

633
00:28:22,744 --> 00:28:26,443
Name two of the other
1,300 species.

634
00:28:27,227 --> 00:28:28,837
Okay, okay.

635
00:28:28,881 --> 00:28:30,946
You know he's trying to get
them to vote for the resort.

636
00:28:30,970 --> 00:28:33,581
Okay, I know dwarf is one kind
but what's another kind? Yeah.

637
00:28:35,496 --> 00:28:37,343
What could they possibly be laughing
about? Audrey? Audrey? Audrey?

638
00:28:37,367 --> 00:28:39,195
Oh. Uh, uh, uh, uh... desert.

639
00:28:44,113 --> 00:28:45,113
Let's see 'em.

640
00:28:50,424 --> 00:28:52,426
When did they even have
time to write all those?

641
00:28:53,862 --> 00:28:55,516
We cannot let him win!

642
00:28:58,432 --> 00:29:01,914
And so it looks like
it's coming down to...

643
00:29:01,957 --> 00:29:03,089
We Noel It All...

644
00:29:03,132 --> 00:29:05,221
Yes! Yes!

645
00:29:05,265 --> 00:29:07,049
And Too Cool For Yule.

646
00:29:07,093 --> 00:29:09,922
Yeah!
Come on! Come on!

647
00:29:09,965 --> 00:29:13,012
And it is coming down
to the final question,

648
00:29:13,055 --> 00:29:15,710
which is...

649
00:29:15,754 --> 00:29:19,409
What tradition... oh, and this was started
by my wife, uh, Hailey Parker, by the way.

650
00:29:19,453 --> 00:29:20,802
Thank you, Hailey.

651
00:29:20,846 --> 00:29:23,587
What tradition used
to be incorporated

652
00:29:23,631 --> 00:29:28,070
into the school Christmas
recital every year?

653
00:29:29,550 --> 00:29:31,750
No way they know this, Fred
and Maureen don't have kids!

654
00:29:41,388 --> 00:29:42,563
Kickline wins it!

655
00:29:42,606 --> 00:29:45,087
Yes! Yes! Yes!

656
00:29:45,131 --> 00:29:47,046
We Noel It All are the winners!

657
00:29:47,089 --> 00:29:49,439
We won! We won!
We won! We won!

658
00:29:52,094 --> 00:29:55,141
That's it! What's it?

659
00:29:55,184 --> 00:29:58,144
That's how we save the
center! A town-wide kickline.

660
00:29:58,187 --> 00:30:00,842
We could get people to sign
up and pledge per kick.

661
00:30:00,886 --> 00:30:03,410
Imagine, a huge kickline
going down Main Street.

662
00:30:03,453 --> 00:30:06,021
It'll be so visually
stunning no one could ignore it.

663
00:30:06,065 --> 00:30:07,501
I love it.

664
00:30:07,544 --> 00:30:08,676
Count me in.

665
00:30:08,719 --> 00:30:10,896
Yes! Yes! Yes!

666
00:30:12,680 --> 00:30:15,596
Sign up for the Kickline
Kick-a-thon right here!

667
00:30:15,639 --> 00:30:16,902
Come and get it!

668
00:30:16,945 --> 00:30:18,817
Thank you. See you there.

669
00:30:18,860 --> 00:30:20,949
Oh, kickline...
like the Rockettes?

670
00:30:20,993 --> 00:30:24,344
Yes. And all the money we raise will
be going to save the rec center.

671
00:30:24,387 --> 00:30:25,998
I'm so in.

672
00:30:26,041 --> 00:30:28,019
I've been taking ceramic
classes there since I was four.

673
00:30:28,043 --> 00:30:30,089
Aw, well, here.
Invite your friends.

674
00:30:30,132 --> 00:30:32,004
Get them to sign
up, too.Definitely.

675
00:30:32,047 --> 00:30:33,135
Bye.

676
00:30:41,317 --> 00:30:42,841
Hi. Kickline Kick-a-thon.

677
00:30:47,802 --> 00:30:53,286
Now remember, baking is
both, an art and a science.

678
00:30:53,329 --> 00:30:54,983
Hello.Huh.

679
00:30:55,027 --> 00:30:58,160
Hey, Audrey. You're
just in time.

680
00:30:58,204 --> 00:31:00,510
We're making
some, uh, Christmas rolls

681
00:31:00,554 --> 00:31:02,469
which apparently are
just cinnamon rolls

682
00:31:02,512 --> 00:31:04,340
with red and green
food coloring on them.

683
00:31:04,384 --> 00:31:06,647
Right? And a dash
of peppermint.

684
00:31:06,690 --> 00:31:08,736
Griffin bakes.Yep.

685
00:31:08,779 --> 00:31:11,173
Well, he was sweet
enough to offer to help

686
00:31:11,217 --> 00:31:13,132
since tomorrow's
Mistletoe Christmas Market

687
00:31:13,175 --> 00:31:14,829
usually involves a large order.

688
00:31:14,873 --> 00:31:16,570
How sweet of him.

689
00:31:16,613 --> 00:31:19,268
I'm sure there's no
hidden motive whatsoever.

690
00:31:19,312 --> 00:31:22,010
My vote? Trust me,
I am well-aware.

691
00:31:22,054 --> 00:31:23,142
But he volunteered

692
00:31:23,185 --> 00:31:25,100
and I need as much
help as I can get.

693
00:31:25,144 --> 00:31:26,667
Oh, well, I'll help, too, then.

694
00:31:26,710 --> 00:31:28,688
Uh, not that much help. I
think we've probably got it.

695
00:31:28,712 --> 00:31:30,279
I'm here. Might as well.

696
00:31:31,019 --> 00:31:32,455
Okay, sure.

697
00:31:32,499 --> 00:31:35,241
I'll just grab an
apron. Oh, got one!

698
00:31:35,284 --> 00:31:37,591
Here.

699
00:31:37,634 --> 00:31:40,768
Now this recipe was handed
down to me by my mother.

700
00:31:40,811 --> 00:31:41,856
Aw.

701
00:31:41,900 --> 00:31:43,205
Oh, so she was a baker, too?

702
00:31:43,249 --> 00:31:46,078
Oh, yes, just not
professionally.

703
00:31:46,121 --> 00:31:49,342
Although, neither was
I until 10 years ago.

704
00:31:49,385 --> 00:31:51,668
You're kidding me. I would've thought
you'd been doing this your whole life.

705
00:31:51,692 --> 00:31:52,911
I used to be a lawyer.

706
00:31:52,954 --> 00:31:53,954
Really? Mm-hmm.

707
00:31:55,261 --> 00:31:58,177
Oh, shoot. I'm gonna
get some more flour.

708
00:31:58,220 --> 00:31:59,656
Okay. Thanks, Darlene.

709
00:31:59,700 --> 00:32:00,875
You're not gonna get her vote

710
00:32:00,919 --> 00:32:03,617
so you can stop
whatever... this is.

711
00:32:03,660 --> 00:32:05,271
Well, think of all
the resort guests

712
00:32:05,314 --> 00:32:07,577
who get to enjoy
Darlene's delights.

713
00:32:07,621 --> 00:32:09,164
Oh, so you're telling
me that your resort

714
00:32:09,188 --> 00:32:10,687
wouldn't have a bunch
of chain restaurants

715
00:32:10,711 --> 00:32:12,495
that everyone would
go to instead?

716
00:32:12,539 --> 00:32:14,758
People deserve to
have options, Audrey.

717
00:32:14,802 --> 00:32:16,369
Tell that to all
the local businesses

718
00:32:16,412 --> 00:32:18,371
that are at the
Mistletoe Marketplace.

719
00:32:18,414 --> 00:32:20,025
Right. What's
that again?

720
00:32:20,068 --> 00:32:22,505
The small fair at the rec center
where the local businesses

721
00:32:22,549 --> 00:32:24,290
come to promote their
Christmastime items.

722
00:32:24,333 --> 00:32:26,118
That could be
really informative.

723
00:32:26,161 --> 00:32:27,597
Oh, no. I'm coming.

724
00:32:27,641 --> 00:32:29,164
No, no, no, no, no.
You're not invited.

725
00:32:29,208 --> 00:32:30,383
I'm coming. No!

726
00:32:30,426 --> 00:32:32,254
I'll be there. No!

727
00:32:32,298 --> 00:32:33,516
Ah, this...

728
00:32:33,560 --> 00:32:35,910
Okay. This is way too painful.

729
00:32:35,954 --> 00:32:37,148
Well, I don't know,
it's like, broken.

730
00:32:37,172 --> 00:32:39,000
Let me show you how
you do it. Ugh, gosh.

731
00:32:40,132 --> 00:32:43,265
Go in these... in the lines.

732
00:32:43,309 --> 00:32:44,310
What?

733
00:32:46,094 --> 00:32:47,443
You have something on your nose.

734
00:32:49,663 --> 00:32:50,664
Flour.

735
00:32:52,013 --> 00:32:53,275
Oh.So do you.

736
00:32:54,407 --> 00:32:56,670
Well look, now we, um...

737
00:32:56,713 --> 00:32:58,153
At least we have
something in common.

738
00:33:09,944 --> 00:33:10,989
Hello?

739
00:33:11,032 --> 00:33:12,991
I've got some good news for you.

740
00:33:13,643 --> 00:33:14,731
Oh?

741
00:33:14,775 --> 00:33:16,777
Peter is retiring.

742
00:33:16,820 --> 00:33:18,474
Really? Yeah.

743
00:33:18,518 --> 00:33:19,974
Something about wanting
to spend more time

744
00:33:19,998 --> 00:33:21,347
with his family or something

745
00:33:21,390 --> 00:33:24,350
so I told the board I had
the perfect replacement.

746
00:33:24,393 --> 00:33:26,047
What?

747
00:33:26,091 --> 00:33:27,353
Me?

748
00:33:27,396 --> 00:33:31,705
Of course, you're my
son. This is your legacy.

749
00:33:32,793 --> 00:33:35,013
You land that Montana resort

750
00:33:35,056 --> 00:33:36,884
and you'll be the next
chief operating officer

751
00:33:36,927 --> 00:33:38,146
of Skyridge Resorts.

752
00:33:38,799 --> 00:33:39,800
Um...

753
00:33:40,975 --> 00:33:42,194
Right.

754
00:33:42,237 --> 00:33:44,457
Do I sense some hesitation?

755
00:33:44,500 --> 00:33:48,939
No. I mean, recently, there's
been a little bit of pushback

756
00:33:48,983 --> 00:33:50,202
from the community, but...

757
00:33:51,768 --> 00:33:53,616
nothing I can't handle.
It's nothing to worry about.

758
00:33:53,640 --> 00:33:56,164
I should hope not. The
next COO of Skyridge

759
00:33:56,208 --> 00:33:58,316
can handle a few disgruntled
townies.

760
00:33:58,340 --> 00:33:59,950
That's right.

761
00:33:59,994 --> 00:34:01,952
I gotta jump on this
call. Talk later?

762
00:34:01,996 --> 00:34:03,084
All right, thanks, Dad.

763
00:34:09,351 --> 00:34:10,570
Oh, hey...

764
00:34:13,051 --> 00:34:15,313
Looking good,
sweetheart. Thanks, Dad.

765
00:34:15,357 --> 00:34:16,445
Morning.

766
00:34:17,054 --> 00:34:18,447
No.

767
00:34:18,491 --> 00:34:21,842
No, no, no, no, no!
What are you doing?

768
00:34:21,885 --> 00:34:23,496
I'm setting up my booth.

769
00:34:23,539 --> 00:34:26,237
Spoke to the council, turns out
all you gotta do is pay a fee

770
00:34:26,281 --> 00:34:27,911
and then anyone can set
one of these things up.

771
00:34:27,935 --> 00:34:30,851
And look at this. They chose to
put us right next to each other.

772
00:34:30,893 --> 00:34:32,244
Why do you need a booth?

773
00:34:32,286 --> 00:34:34,114
Well, so people can
learn some information

774
00:34:34,159 --> 00:34:35,507
about Skyridge Resorts.

775
00:34:35,551 --> 00:34:37,074
Look, then the community

776
00:34:37,118 --> 00:34:38,835
can get to know us a little
better. What do you think of this?

777
00:34:38,859 --> 00:34:40,817
Look at that!

778
00:34:40,860 --> 00:34:42,514
The Mistletoe Christmas Market

779
00:34:42,558 --> 00:34:45,300
is to promote
businesses in Mistletoe.

780
00:34:45,344 --> 00:34:47,520
You're not a business
in Mistletoe!

781
00:34:47,563 --> 00:34:49,130
Right, I know. Not yet.

782
00:34:49,174 --> 00:34:50,934
Is it too big? I think
it's a little too big.

783
00:34:58,357 --> 00:34:59,706
Kickline Fundraiser!

784
00:34:59,749 --> 00:35:02,970
A few kicks each and
we save the rec center!

785
00:35:09,281 --> 00:35:10,456
Jim. Yeah?

786
00:35:10,499 --> 00:35:12,022
Will you watch my
booth for a second?

787
00:35:12,501 --> 00:35:13,981
Sure. Why?

788
00:35:14,024 --> 00:35:15,678
Somebody's
gotta stop him.

789
00:35:16,853 --> 00:35:18,290
Okay.

790
00:35:21,206 --> 00:35:22,250
Hey.

791
00:35:22,294 --> 00:35:24,165
Griffin. Hi.

792
00:35:24,209 --> 00:35:26,907
Talk later. Audrey. Hi.

793
00:35:28,256 --> 00:35:29,910
Brochure? Oh, no.

794
00:35:29,953 --> 00:35:31,477
Um, actually, I wanted to see

795
00:35:31,520 --> 00:35:33,087
if you wanted to
grab a cup of coffee.

796
00:35:33,131 --> 00:35:35,437
Black, no sugar.
Just how you like it.

797
00:35:35,481 --> 00:35:37,961
Yeah. You're kidding.

798
00:35:38,005 --> 00:35:41,356
No, come on. Let's go.

799
00:35:41,400 --> 00:35:45,012
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait. I know what you're doing.

800
00:35:45,055 --> 00:35:46,622
You don't wanna
get coffee with me.

801
00:35:46,666 --> 00:35:49,538
You want me to leave this little
Christmas market, don't you?

802
00:35:49,582 --> 00:35:51,192
And I know what you're up to.

803
00:35:51,236 --> 00:35:53,238
You're trying to
razzle-dazzle this town

804
00:35:53,281 --> 00:35:56,893
into thinking what you want
instead of what we want.

805
00:35:56,937 --> 00:36:00,288
You mean what you
want. "Razzle-dazzle."

806
00:36:00,332 --> 00:36:02,943
All right. Enlighten me.

807
00:36:03,509 --> 00:36:04,597
Fine.

808
00:36:07,295 --> 00:36:10,342
Look. This booth over
here with the snow-globes,

809
00:36:10,385 --> 00:36:12,344
it's our bookshop.

810
00:36:12,387 --> 00:36:14,259
They do weekly
story-time for kids.

811
00:36:16,913 --> 00:36:19,699
And you know Carl from class.

812
00:36:19,742 --> 00:36:21,266
Hello,
Carl.

813
00:36:21,309 --> 00:36:24,486
He's the fourth Carl in his
family to own this tavern.

814
00:36:24,530 --> 00:36:26,880
Any boy born in our
family gets the name.

815
00:36:26,923 --> 00:36:28,011
And some girls, too.

816
00:36:29,012 --> 00:36:31,014
Carla. Carlita.

817
00:36:31,885 --> 00:36:33,582
And this is Abe's Auto Shop.

818
00:36:33,626 --> 00:36:35,454
He can fix anything,
not just cars.

819
00:36:36,629 --> 00:36:38,108
Wow. This is great.

820
00:36:38,152 --> 00:36:40,459
All this information for
little conversation starters

821
00:36:40,502 --> 00:36:42,112
when I wanna promote the resort.

822
00:36:42,156 --> 00:36:43,592
Thank you. Thank you for that.

823
00:36:43,636 --> 00:36:45,638
No.

824
00:36:45,681 --> 00:36:48,380
I'm trying to tell you that
each of these establishments

825
00:36:48,423 --> 00:36:50,208
are run by people.

826
00:36:50,251 --> 00:36:53,167
Unique individuals that your
corporate resort would hurt.

827
00:36:53,211 --> 00:36:55,648
You mean help, right?

828
00:36:55,691 --> 00:36:56,953
This town cannot afford

829
00:36:56,997 --> 00:36:59,129
to even keep the
recreation center open.

830
00:36:59,173 --> 00:37:01,654
Yet you have this
beautiful location

831
00:37:01,697 --> 00:37:03,569
that would just attract
tons and tons of people

832
00:37:03,612 --> 00:37:05,353
and it would boost the economy.

833
00:37:05,397 --> 00:37:08,574
I saw the list of
amenities your resort has.

834
00:37:08,617 --> 00:37:10,924
Restaurants. There
goes Carl's Tavern.

835
00:37:10,967 --> 00:37:13,361
Shopping. Goodbye
Main Street boutiques.

836
00:37:13,405 --> 00:37:15,058
And it's a domino effect.

837
00:37:15,102 --> 00:37:17,017
One corporate
resort comes to town

838
00:37:17,060 --> 00:37:19,106
and the rest are sure to follow.

839
00:37:19,149 --> 00:37:21,674
What is it that you have
against big companies?

840
00:37:21,717 --> 00:37:22,805
Nothing.

841
00:37:22,849 --> 00:37:25,634
They just don't belong here.

842
00:37:25,678 --> 00:37:28,115
Can you honestly tell me
that none of these people

843
00:37:28,158 --> 00:37:30,291
would lose their businesses
because of your resort?

844
00:37:35,514 --> 00:37:38,691
Oh, Audrey, have you
met my grandson Elvis?

845
00:37:38,734 --> 00:37:41,563
Hi. Hi, Elvis,
you're adorable.

846
00:37:42,956 --> 00:37:44,087
Do you want one?

847
00:37:45,567 --> 00:37:47,265
He got it.

848
00:37:47,308 --> 00:37:49,310
Mistletoe Toss is open.

849
00:37:50,442 --> 00:37:52,966
Dare I ask what a
Mistletoe Toss is?

850
00:37:53,009 --> 00:37:55,403
It's exactly what
it sounds like.

851
00:38:02,802 --> 00:38:04,456
What color do you
want? No, I'm good.

852
00:38:04,499 --> 00:38:06,719
I don't wanna throw a parasitic
plant at a peppermint...

853
00:38:06,762 --> 00:38:07,981
Griffin.Yep.

854
00:38:08,024 --> 00:38:09,983
Mistletoe tradition.Mm.

855
00:38:10,026 --> 00:38:11,027
You must try.

856
00:38:11,811 --> 00:38:12,811
Come on, it's fun.Okay.

857
00:38:13,639 --> 00:38:15,075
Go, Team Audrey. Thanks, Dad.

858
00:38:16,642 --> 00:38:18,078
What, you scared?

859
00:38:18,121 --> 00:38:19,427
Scared?

860
00:38:19,471 --> 00:38:20,863
Well, you said you worked out

861
00:38:20,907 --> 00:38:22,561
and then my class
kicked your butt,

862
00:38:22,604 --> 00:38:24,737
so I'm guessing that
you're a little nervous

863
00:38:24,780 --> 00:38:27,653
to lose at the Mistletoe Toss
in front of all these people.

864
00:38:27,696 --> 00:38:31,221
Okay, fine. I'll
play you. Let's go.

865
00:38:31,265 --> 00:38:32,875
Are you sure? I'm
practically pro.

866
00:38:32,919 --> 00:38:34,877
What, at this?

867
00:38:34,921 --> 00:38:38,359
How about this?
If I win... Yeah.

868
00:38:38,403 --> 00:38:40,883
You take down your resort
propaganda routine.

869
00:38:42,189 --> 00:38:43,582
Okay. Okay.

870
00:38:43,625 --> 00:38:47,629
And if I win,
which I will, then,

871
00:38:47,673 --> 00:38:49,457
hmm, what am I gonna do? Oh!

872
00:38:49,501 --> 00:38:51,241
I am not giving up the kickline.

873
00:38:51,285 --> 00:38:52,808
You have to have dinner with me.

874
00:38:52,852 --> 00:38:54,854
What? Why?

875
00:38:54,897 --> 00:38:57,857
I think maybe we got
off on the wrong foot.

876
00:38:57,900 --> 00:38:59,815
We could have a
productive conversation

877
00:38:59,859 --> 00:39:02,209
and I could share
with you all the merit

878
00:39:02,252 --> 00:39:04,472
of the Skyridge Resort.

879
00:39:04,516 --> 00:39:06,953
You're not gonna change my mind.

880
00:39:06,996 --> 00:39:08,824
But since I know I'm gonna win,

881
00:39:09,564 --> 00:39:11,305
okay, sure,

882
00:39:12,785 --> 00:39:13,829
let's do it.

883
00:39:14,569 --> 00:39:15,657
Ladies first.

884
00:39:17,529 --> 00:39:20,445
Oh, I thought you
said you were pro.

885
00:39:20,488 --> 00:39:22,882
Warming
up, Griffin. All right.

886
00:39:26,451 --> 00:39:28,104
Okay, maybe I'm just
warming up, too.

887
00:39:28,148 --> 00:39:29,584
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

888
00:39:29,628 --> 00:39:31,586
Let's see what you got.Mm-hmm.

889
00:39:32,979 --> 00:39:34,502
Yes!

890
00:39:34,546 --> 00:39:36,417
Okay, that's luck.
That is luck.

891
00:39:36,461 --> 00:39:38,637
Skill. Skill, skill,
skill. That is luck.

892
00:39:38,680 --> 00:39:39,960
All right, here
we go. This is...

893
00:39:40,769 --> 00:39:42,684
Oh!

894
00:39:42,728 --> 00:39:44,469
Now that was luck.
No, that was skill.

895
00:39:45,948 --> 00:39:47,689
All right, what you
got.

896
00:39:50,344 --> 00:39:52,433
Might as well start taking
your booth down now.

897
00:39:52,477 --> 00:39:55,871
How about you get ready to
choose what you want for dinner

898
00:39:55,915 --> 00:39:57,635
'cause this is going
right on. Look at that.

899
00:39:58,570 --> 00:40:01,007
Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.
What've you got?

900
00:40:04,619 --> 00:40:07,143
Ooh!

901
00:40:09,668 --> 00:40:11,365
I am so sorry but if I make this

902
00:40:11,409 --> 00:40:13,976
I win the entire thing,
the Mistletoe Toss?

903
00:40:14,020 --> 00:40:15,238
You won't.Okay.

904
00:40:16,762 --> 00:40:18,851
Oh, yeah!

905
00:40:18,894 --> 00:40:22,245
Game, set and match.
That was a fluke.

906
00:40:22,289 --> 00:40:23,943
I thought you were a pro?

907
00:40:23,986 --> 00:40:25,684
Just a question. Do
you like Italian?

908
00:40:25,727 --> 00:40:28,295
Because Carl's Tavern has
a really nice Bolognese.

909
00:40:28,338 --> 00:40:29,775
Yeah, I don't eat meat anymore.

910
00:40:29,818 --> 00:40:31,777
No?

911
00:40:35,302 --> 00:40:36,782
A date?

912
00:40:36,825 --> 00:40:38,348
It's not a date, it's dinner.

913
00:40:38,392 --> 00:40:40,350
Alone, together.

914
00:40:40,394 --> 00:40:42,309
I'm sure I could get out of it.

915
00:40:42,352 --> 00:40:44,006
Why?

916
00:40:44,050 --> 00:40:46,400
It could be fun, and you
and Bradley are on a break.

917
00:40:47,619 --> 00:40:48,924
But he's the enemy.

918
00:40:49,751 --> 00:40:51,579
Pretty cute enemy.

919
00:40:51,623 --> 00:40:52,774
Trust me, it's the last thing

920
00:40:52,798 --> 00:40:54,190
I have to think about right now.

921
00:40:55,061 --> 00:40:56,628
Hmm.

922
00:40:56,671 --> 00:40:58,804
What do you have to
think about right now?

923
00:40:58,847 --> 00:41:01,371
The Solis job? Bradley?

924
00:41:01,415 --> 00:41:04,244
Right now, it's the kickline.
We have a lot of sign-ups,

925
00:41:04,287 --> 00:41:06,289
we just need a lot
more kick pledges.

926
00:41:06,333 --> 00:41:08,596
You should definitely
take it online.

927
00:41:08,640 --> 00:41:10,293
I would love a blueberry scone,

928
00:41:10,337 --> 00:41:11,947
as long as there's
no lemon zest in it,

929
00:41:11,991 --> 00:41:13,993
'cause that is disgusting.

930
00:41:14,036 --> 00:41:16,343
See, Lisa? I'm
not the only one.

931
00:41:16,386 --> 00:41:18,824
Right? Totally overpowers
the simplicity of the scone.

932
00:41:18,867 --> 00:41:21,087
I've been saying that for years.

933
00:41:21,130 --> 00:41:22,175
She really has.

934
00:41:23,306 --> 00:41:24,873
What do you mean take it online?

935
00:41:24,917 --> 00:41:27,267
The kickline is already
connected to a "Donate Now" page.

936
00:41:27,310 --> 00:41:30,183
Well, since you're asking,
Mistletoe is only so big, right?

937
00:41:30,226 --> 00:41:31,358
Mm.

938
00:41:31,401 --> 00:41:33,186
So, if you livestream the event,

939
00:41:33,229 --> 00:41:34,666
then you reach a larger audience

940
00:41:34,709 --> 00:41:37,712
and interest in this thing
just goes up and up and up.

941
00:41:37,756 --> 00:41:38,844
And if you open it up,

942
00:41:38,887 --> 00:41:40,759
then people
everywhere can donate

943
00:41:40,802 --> 00:41:42,082
to your little line kicky thing.

944
00:41:42,674 --> 00:41:43,762
Kickline.

945
00:41:43,805 --> 00:41:45,111
That... yeah, that.

946
00:41:45,851 --> 00:41:46,852
Ooh!

947
00:41:48,331 --> 00:41:51,117
There
we go. See ya tonight.

948
00:41:52,901 --> 00:41:54,468
See ya tonight... Tonight?

949
00:41:54,512 --> 00:41:56,688
Wait! We never decided
on a day for dinner.

950
00:41:56,731 --> 00:41:57,776
Tonight!

951
00:41:59,778 --> 00:42:01,431
See? He's never
doing something

952
00:42:01,475 --> 00:42:02,887
out of the kindness
of his own heart.

953
00:42:02,911 --> 00:42:04,498
Helping Darlene bake,
taking me to dinner,

954
00:42:04,522 --> 00:42:06,698
there's always a hidden motive.

955
00:42:06,741 --> 00:42:09,527
Still, he did inspire a pretty
good idea. Meh...

956
00:42:09,570 --> 00:42:11,069
And until two seconds
ago I thought you were

957
00:42:11,093 --> 00:42:13,618
the only person who hated
lemon zest in their scones.

958
00:42:13,661 --> 00:42:15,881
Everyone hates lemon
zest in their scones.

959
00:42:17,273 --> 00:42:20,363
It's like fruitcake.
Everybody hates fruitcake.

960
00:42:20,407 --> 00:42:24,585
Okay, so, the first link is for
everyone anywhere to watch the kickline.

961
00:42:24,629 --> 00:42:27,675
And then this link is
connected to the donate page

962
00:42:27,719 --> 00:42:29,155
so people can pledge per kick.

963
00:42:29,198 --> 00:42:30,678
Crazy.

964
00:42:30,722 --> 00:42:33,246
Bradley did all this tech
stuff for the gym in New York,

965
00:42:33,289 --> 00:42:35,770
but today, I figured
out I can do it too.

966
00:42:37,250 --> 00:42:39,078
I like seeing you so determined.

967
00:42:39,121 --> 00:42:40,340
Thanks, Dad.

968
00:42:40,383 --> 00:42:42,734
It feels good to be
hopeful again.Yeah.

969
00:42:45,258 --> 00:42:46,433
You expecting anybody?

970
00:42:47,956 --> 00:42:49,305
Tell him I'm not home.

971
00:42:57,879 --> 00:42:59,228
Yeah, she's... Oh,
she's not here.

972
00:43:00,839 --> 00:43:03,798
A poinsettia? Funny.

973
00:43:03,842 --> 00:43:05,583
Pretty sure it's
"poinsett-ia."

974
00:43:05,626 --> 00:43:07,672
And I was... I'm
going more for sweet,

975
00:43:07,715 --> 00:43:09,587
but funny, I'll... I'll
take funny from you.

976
00:43:09,630 --> 00:43:12,415
I know what you're doing. You're
trying to be all charming and sweet.

977
00:43:12,459 --> 00:43:13,915
So you do think I'm
charming and sweet.

978
00:43:13,939 --> 00:43:17,333
You want my dad's vote.

979
00:43:17,377 --> 00:43:19,379
You've got Fred and
Maureen in the bag.

980
00:43:19,422 --> 00:43:20,815
Jackie is a wild card.

981
00:43:20,859 --> 00:43:23,426
Jim still believes
there's a better solution.

982
00:43:23,470 --> 00:43:26,778
And Darlene, hmm,
you just don't know.

983
00:43:26,821 --> 00:43:29,694
So you're trying to secure
me to get all of them.

984
00:43:31,260 --> 00:43:33,567
Wow. That is an exhausting way

985
00:43:33,611 --> 00:43:35,371
to look at somebody who just
wants to invite you to dinner.

986
00:43:35,395 --> 00:43:36,570
Am I wrong?

987
00:43:38,659 --> 00:43:42,271
Listen. My objective is
this, to better this town.

988
00:43:42,315 --> 00:43:44,796
My objective tonight
is to have dinner.

989
00:43:44,839 --> 00:43:46,580
Preferably with you
right next to me

990
00:43:46,624 --> 00:43:49,627
and prove to you that I'm not some
evil corporate mustache twirler.

991
00:43:49,931 --> 00:43:51,063
Right?

992
00:43:51,106 --> 00:43:52,281
She would love to go.

993
00:43:52,325 --> 00:43:54,109
Dad.

994
00:43:54,153 --> 00:43:55,850
It's dinner. It's
not eternity.

995
00:43:56,808 --> 00:43:58,157
Good luck.

996
00:43:58,200 --> 00:43:59,332
It's just dinner.

997
00:44:03,553 --> 00:44:07,514
So why fitness? Why fitness?

998
00:44:07,557 --> 00:44:09,124
Thanks, Carl. CARL: Enjoy.

999
00:44:09,168 --> 00:44:10,168
Thanks, Carl.

1000
00:44:10,778 --> 00:44:12,432
My mom.

1001
00:44:12,475 --> 00:44:16,436
She taught me that it is a
privilege to move your body

1002
00:44:16,479 --> 00:44:18,177
and we shouldn't
take it for granted.

1003
00:44:18,220 --> 00:44:22,485
I've never... I've never
thought of it quite like that.

1004
00:44:22,529 --> 00:44:25,793
I just love inspiring
people to want to work out.

1005
00:44:25,837 --> 00:44:27,031
Is that why you
moved to New York,

1006
00:44:27,055 --> 00:44:29,928
to spread the gospel
of enjoying workouts?

1007
00:44:29,971 --> 00:44:31,886
My mom was originally
from New York

1008
00:44:31,930 --> 00:44:33,932
so it was always my
dream to go there, too.

1009
00:44:35,324 --> 00:44:38,023
You know, if you can
make it there, you can...

1010
00:44:39,024 --> 00:44:43,593
Yeah. So can I... Can I ask,

1011
00:44:43,637 --> 00:44:45,421
what happened in
New York exactly?

1012
00:44:47,380 --> 00:44:50,470
Well, Bradley, uh, my
business partner and I,

1013
00:44:51,906 --> 00:44:54,604
we thought that a
neighborhood gym could thrive.

1014
00:44:54,648 --> 00:44:57,303
You know, something
small and boutique.

1015
00:44:57,346 --> 00:44:58,870
We put all our money into it

1016
00:44:58,913 --> 00:45:02,221
and, you know, and then
we just couldn't compete

1017
00:45:02,264 --> 00:45:05,180
with the big chains and
it fell apart and...

1018
00:45:05,224 --> 00:45:07,095
we fell apart.

1019
00:45:07,139 --> 00:45:08,618
Everything fell apart.

1020
00:45:10,925 --> 00:45:14,450
So, I take it,
Bradley, then is...

1021
00:45:14,494 --> 00:45:17,236
is a little bit more
than a business partner.

1022
00:45:17,279 --> 00:45:19,412
Boyfriend. Well,
not currently.

1023
00:45:20,239 --> 00:45:21,370
We're on a break.

1024
00:45:22,110 --> 00:45:23,372
Okay. Well,

1025
00:45:23,416 --> 00:45:26,201
that explains why
you have a grudge

1026
00:45:26,245 --> 00:45:27,725
against large companies then,

1027
00:45:27,768 --> 00:45:30,205
because they ran you
out of business, right?

1028
00:45:30,249 --> 00:45:32,425
I don't have a grudge.Oh.

1029
00:45:32,468 --> 00:45:34,819
Solis Fitness Center has
offered us jobs in the new year

1030
00:45:34,862 --> 00:45:36,951
and I'm seriously
considering accepting.

1031
00:45:36,995 --> 00:45:38,257
So you're considering

1032
00:45:38,300 --> 00:45:40,825
working for a large
corporation, right?

1033
00:45:40,868 --> 00:45:43,218
Yet you're actively
trying to stop me,

1034
00:45:43,262 --> 00:45:45,481
a large corporation. No,
not at all the same thing.

1035
00:45:45,525 --> 00:45:47,005
Oh, please explain.

1036
00:45:47,048 --> 00:45:49,137
I'm not
trying to stop you.

1037
00:45:50,791 --> 00:45:52,401
Okay, I am.

1038
00:45:52,445 --> 00:45:54,447
I am. I'm trying to stop you.

1039
00:45:54,490 --> 00:45:56,928
But it's because I'm trying
to save the rec center.

1040
00:45:56,971 --> 00:45:58,277
You just happen to be the person

1041
00:45:58,320 --> 00:46:00,670
that wants to tear it all down.

1042
00:46:00,714 --> 00:46:02,890
Otherwise we'd be
friends, though, right?

1043
00:46:02,934 --> 00:46:05,632
Mm, I don't know
if I'd go that far.

1044
00:46:07,721 --> 00:46:10,724
I can't be friends with
somebody who says poinsett-ia.

1045
00:46:10,768 --> 00:46:12,682
It's poinsettia.

1046
00:46:15,337 --> 00:46:17,470
Really? You can't name five?

1047
00:46:18,950 --> 00:46:21,256
I don't think I could
actually name one.

1048
00:46:21,300 --> 00:46:24,520
Oh! You know what?
My friend... Okay.

1049
00:46:24,564 --> 00:46:27,610
Had a cat. No, goldfish.Good.

1050
00:46:27,654 --> 00:46:29,917
Girl... Victoria.
No, Victor. Victor.

1051
00:46:29,961 --> 00:46:32,050
No! Victor? Yeah.

1052
00:46:32,093 --> 00:46:35,401
Oh, my God. Vixen!
Oh, close enough.

1053
00:46:35,444 --> 00:46:38,708
Vixen. Oh, this is real.

1054
00:46:38,752 --> 00:46:39,947
What's... What's
real? The whole...

1055
00:46:39,971 --> 00:46:41,799
The whole Christmas is
all about making money,

1056
00:46:41,842 --> 00:46:43,322
the Scrooge routine.

1057
00:46:43,365 --> 00:46:45,082
I hate to break it to you
but them are the facts.

1058
00:46:45,106 --> 00:46:47,195
Yes, but you're
missing the point.

1059
00:46:47,239 --> 00:46:48,283
What's the point?

1060
00:46:48,327 --> 00:46:49,894
The reason for it all.

1061
00:46:52,548 --> 00:46:56,335
Christmas is... it's
about a feeling.

1062
00:46:56,378 --> 00:46:59,120
It's... it's something that
you can't put into words.

1063
00:47:01,601 --> 00:47:04,647
My... my mom was
really into Christmas.

1064
00:47:04,691 --> 00:47:06,867
Like, we're talking
Mistletoe level.

1065
00:47:06,911 --> 00:47:11,350
Yeah. I think if she
was still around,

1066
00:47:12,699 --> 00:47:14,329
you know, maybe things
would be different.

1067
00:47:14,353 --> 00:47:15,963
I'd look at Christmas
a bit differently.

1068
00:47:18,444 --> 00:47:19,924
Maybe that's why my dad

1069
00:47:19,967 --> 00:47:21,205
doesn't wanna celebrate with me,

1070
00:47:21,229 --> 00:47:23,362
is 'cause it's too hard for him.

1071
00:47:23,405 --> 00:47:24,537
What does your dad do?

1072
00:47:27,105 --> 00:47:29,498
Um, he's in real estate.

1073
00:47:29,542 --> 00:47:33,633
He, uh... he owns
Skyridge Resorts.

1074
00:47:33,676 --> 00:47:36,331
Your dad owns Skyridge? Mm-hmm.

1075
00:47:36,375 --> 00:47:38,638
Skyridge is a family business?

1076
00:47:38,681 --> 00:47:40,379
Yep. Sure is.

1077
00:47:40,422 --> 00:47:42,076
It's sort of like Carl's Tavern,

1078
00:47:42,120 --> 00:47:44,359
you know, we'll just fit right
in. Oh, just like Carl's Tavern.

1079
00:47:44,383 --> 00:47:47,081
Carl's Tavern is not trying
to take over the world.

1080
00:47:47,125 --> 00:47:48,256
Neither are we.

1081
00:47:48,300 --> 00:47:52,086
I mean, I do have a shot at COO

1082
00:47:52,130 --> 00:47:53,958
if I make this
deal come together.

1083
00:47:54,001 --> 00:47:58,963
You know, it'd also make
my dad really happy, so...

1084
00:47:59,006 --> 00:48:00,886
Well, what about you,
would that make you happy?

1085
00:48:02,270 --> 00:48:03,837
Why wouldn't it?

1086
00:48:03,881 --> 00:48:06,840
Well, you know, when
you were little...

1087
00:48:08,886 --> 00:48:10,496
what did you dream about?

1088
00:48:10,539 --> 00:48:13,107
Is COO your New York?

1089
00:48:14,935 --> 00:48:16,632
Um...

1090
00:48:16,676 --> 00:48:21,550
No. It was just my
assumed... path for me.

1091
00:48:23,335 --> 00:48:24,510
Paths can change.

1092
00:48:32,170 --> 00:48:33,998
I don't know who that is.

1093
00:48:41,092 --> 00:48:42,136
Bradley!

1094
00:48:42,180 --> 00:48:43,833
Surprise.Hi.

1095
00:48:43,877 --> 00:48:45,096
I saw your post this morning

1096
00:48:45,139 --> 00:48:46,943
and I just wanted to come
and help the kickline.

1097
00:48:46,967 --> 00:48:51,754
So I took about three different
flights but I made it.

1098
00:48:51,798 --> 00:48:54,018
Ah, hi.

1099
00:48:58,848 --> 00:49:00,633
Oh, come in.

1100
00:49:00,676 --> 00:49:02,330
The place looks
absolutely great.

1101
00:49:02,374 --> 00:49:05,943
Bradley, Griffin.
Griffin, Bradley.

1102
00:49:07,988 --> 00:49:09,381
Pleasure.

1103
00:49:09,424 --> 00:49:11,296
Hey.Hi.

1104
00:49:11,339 --> 00:49:12,732
What's with the
giant poinsettia?

1105
00:49:12,775 --> 00:49:14,603
Oh, it's a long story.

1106
00:49:14,647 --> 00:49:16,059
Actually,
you know, I'll tell it.

1107
00:49:16,083 --> 00:49:17,519
It's "poinsett-ia."

1108
00:49:17,563 --> 00:49:20,522
I was, uh... I bumped into
Audrey and she kinda dumped...

1109
00:49:20,566 --> 00:49:21,871
she kinda dumped it on me.

1110
00:49:25,484 --> 00:49:26,964
You did what now?

1111
00:49:27,007 --> 00:49:28,661
Don't worry about it.Okay.

1112
00:49:31,359 --> 00:49:33,666
I should probably go. All
right, I'm gonna go. Okay.

1113
00:49:35,842 --> 00:49:37,844
Good to meet you. You, too.

1114
00:49:37,887 --> 00:49:39,106
Thanks for the cookies.

1115
00:49:41,674 --> 00:49:43,328
Who was that guy?

1116
00:49:52,206 --> 00:49:54,556
Bradley's here?

1117
00:49:54,600 --> 00:49:57,037
I thought you guys broke up
because he wouldn't propose.

1118
00:49:57,081 --> 00:49:59,735
No. We're on a break.

1119
00:49:59,779 --> 00:50:04,436
Oh. Uh, is that
different or...

1120
00:50:04,479 --> 00:50:07,004
Apparently, he saw my
post about the kickline

1121
00:50:07,047 --> 00:50:09,354
and said he wanted
to be a part of it.

1122
00:50:09,397 --> 00:50:11,878
He said he knew it
was important to me.

1123
00:50:11,921 --> 00:50:14,315
Well that's kinda sweet, right?

1124
00:50:14,359 --> 00:50:20,321
Very. But I don't know.
It's nice to have the help.

1125
00:50:20,365 --> 00:50:22,976
It's just, it felt good
doing something on my own.

1126
00:50:26,806 --> 00:50:28,155
Jim, what's with the scarf?

1127
00:50:28,199 --> 00:50:29,722
Hmm?

1128
00:50:29,765 --> 00:50:30,853
The... Oh, the...

1129
00:50:32,507 --> 00:50:34,857
Griff wears a scarf, so...

1130
00:50:36,337 --> 00:50:38,905
I guess Griff's making an
impression on everybody.

1131
00:50:38,948 --> 00:50:40,472
Oh, my God, that reminds me.

1132
00:50:40,515 --> 00:50:41,603
How was the date?

1133
00:50:41,647 --> 00:50:43,344
It wasn't a date.
It was dinner.

1134
00:50:43,388 --> 00:50:44,606
And?

1135
00:50:44,650 --> 00:50:49,046
And, all things considered,
if I had to say...

1136
00:50:50,699 --> 00:50:52,745
one way or the other at
the end of the night...

1137
00:50:56,357 --> 00:50:57,532
It was nice.

1138
00:50:58,968 --> 00:51:01,536
But nothing changes
the fact that he wants

1139
00:51:01,580 --> 00:51:05,323
to rip this place apart and
build a mega super-resort.

1140
00:51:05,366 --> 00:51:07,760
Oh, Jim, don't
give me that look.

1141
00:51:07,803 --> 00:51:09,675
Told you so.
It means nothing!

1142
00:51:18,249 --> 00:51:19,467
Thank you. Oh!

1143
00:51:19,511 --> 00:51:21,730
Oh, shoot. Oh,
shoot. I'm so sorry.

1144
00:51:21,774 --> 00:51:23,099
It's me. You know,
I wasn't looking.

1145
00:51:23,123 --> 00:51:24,579
No, no. I was
looking down at my papers.

1146
00:51:24,603 --> 00:51:26,518
Here's your card.

1147
00:51:26,561 --> 00:51:27,736
Yes. Thank you.

1148
00:51:29,564 --> 00:51:33,351
Oh. Okay. You.You.

1149
00:51:35,309 --> 00:51:36,789
Grant, right?

1150
00:51:36,832 --> 00:51:39,139
No, uh, close.
It's, uh, Griffin.

1151
00:51:39,183 --> 00:51:40,227
Griffin.

1152
00:51:40,271 --> 00:51:41,750
Barry?

1153
00:51:41,794 --> 00:51:43,752
Close, actually. It's Bradley.

1154
00:51:43,796 --> 00:51:45,189
Bradley, that's right.Right.

1155
00:51:45,972 --> 00:51:47,408
Yeah.

1156
00:51:47,452 --> 00:51:49,367
So... So... so.

1157
00:51:49,410 --> 00:51:51,673
You are here to destroy
Audrey's rec center.

1158
00:51:51,717 --> 00:51:54,546
I wouldn't word it that
way at all, actually. No?

1159
00:51:54,589 --> 00:51:56,939
No, I'm here to turn this
land into something useful

1160
00:51:56,983 --> 00:51:58,811
that'll benefit Mistletoe
for years to come.

1161
00:51:58,854 --> 00:52:00,204
So, gotta go.Sure.

1162
00:52:00,247 --> 00:52:02,510
Before... Before you go... Okay.

1163
00:52:02,554 --> 00:52:04,643
Just one... one little thing.

1164
00:52:04,686 --> 00:52:07,776
Audrey's mom taught
there before she died.

1165
00:52:07,820 --> 00:52:09,841
You know, that's why the
place means so much to her.

1166
00:52:09,865 --> 00:52:11,954
Yep. I... I know. I know.

1167
00:52:11,998 --> 00:52:14,218
The place means a lot, I got it.

1168
00:52:14,261 --> 00:52:16,785
And Audrey means a lot to me.

1169
00:52:16,829 --> 00:52:18,807
Good. Okay, I'm gonna go.
I should probably go.Yeah.

1170
00:52:18,831 --> 00:52:20,920
Don't wanna be late for,
uh... For class.Sure.

1171
00:52:20,963 --> 00:52:23,792
Class. Audrey's class? Yeah.

1172
00:52:23,836 --> 00:52:25,379
What do you know, I'm
headed there, too.

1173
00:52:25,403 --> 00:52:27,100
No way.Yeah. Amazing.

1174
00:52:27,144 --> 00:52:28,667
That is great. I know.

1175
00:52:28,710 --> 00:52:29,972
Okay, well, after you.

1176
00:52:30,016 --> 00:52:31,974
No, please, I
insist. After you.

1177
00:52:32,018 --> 00:52:33,846
No, no, no. No, no,
age before beauty.

1178
00:52:35,021 --> 00:52:36,172
All right, there you go.Great.

1179
00:52:36,196 --> 00:52:38,851
No. Actually, you
know what? No.

1180
00:52:38,894 --> 00:52:40,331
Oh, come on! No.

1181
00:52:41,810 --> 00:52:43,116
Left side!

1182
00:52:45,510 --> 00:52:46,641
Out and in!

1183
00:52:48,469 --> 00:52:49,601
Right hip!

1184
00:52:50,210 --> 00:52:51,211
Step touch!

1185
00:52:52,604 --> 00:52:53,648
Box step!

1186
00:52:55,259 --> 00:52:56,608
One more time!

1187
00:52:57,609 --> 00:52:58,827
Step touch!

1188
00:52:58,871 --> 00:52:59,872
Box step!

1189
00:53:01,090 --> 00:53:02,266
And ready, finish!

1190
00:53:04,006 --> 00:53:06,008
Whoo!

1191
00:53:06,052 --> 00:53:08,968
Okay. Great job, everybody.

1192
00:53:09,011 --> 00:53:10,448
Thank you, thank you!

1193
00:53:20,980 --> 00:53:23,678
This is different than New York.

1194
00:53:23,722 --> 00:53:25,637
You have to order
the cheese fries.

1195
00:53:25,680 --> 00:53:27,639
I can't, I'm trying to do
this clean eating week.

1196
00:53:27,682 --> 00:53:30,816
You know how it is. Clean
eating? It's Christmas.

1197
00:53:30,859 --> 00:53:32,600
Christmas calories don't count.

1198
00:53:32,644 --> 00:53:34,254
Right.Uh-huh.

1199
00:53:34,298 --> 00:53:35,516
Hmm. I've missed you.

1200
00:53:37,126 --> 00:53:39,172
I still can't
believe you're here.

1201
00:53:39,216 --> 00:53:40,652
A kickline sounded fun

1202
00:53:40,695 --> 00:53:42,695
and I already have some
pledges from some followers.

1203
00:53:42,958 --> 00:53:44,308
What?

1204
00:53:44,351 --> 00:53:46,005
Thank you, that's awesome.

1205
00:53:48,616 --> 00:53:52,359
So, have you given
it any more thought?

1206
00:53:52,403 --> 00:53:54,405
I'll call Solis right now
and tell them we're in.

1207
00:53:54,448 --> 00:53:56,407
I haven't decided
anything just yet.

1208
00:53:56,450 --> 00:53:58,583
Audrey, we... we need
to give them an answer.

1209
00:53:59,845 --> 00:54:02,369
It's not a package deal.

1210
00:54:02,413 --> 00:54:04,284
You could take the
job without me.

1211
00:54:04,328 --> 00:54:07,244
Maybe I don't wanna
do it without you.

1212
00:54:07,287 --> 00:54:10,551
It's just that they want me to
teach their classes their way.

1213
00:54:11,596 --> 00:54:13,250
Yeah. Yeah.

1214
00:54:14,642 --> 00:54:17,776
Hey, you... you remember
what you first said to me

1215
00:54:17,819 --> 00:54:21,040
when we met at that fitness
conference four years ago?

1216
00:54:21,083 --> 00:54:23,260
The greatest gift we have
as fitness instructors

1217
00:54:23,303 --> 00:54:26,480
is to inspire as many
people as possible.

1218
00:54:28,700 --> 00:54:29,962
This is how you do that.

1219
00:54:31,529 --> 00:54:33,095
I can't believe
you remember that.

1220
00:54:36,360 --> 00:54:40,581
So, there's no one here.
Let's say we close early?

1221
00:54:42,322 --> 00:54:44,237
It's like you read
my mind.Mm-hmm.

1222
00:54:45,760 --> 00:54:47,545
Oh, good, you're
still open. Hey.

1223
00:54:48,981 --> 00:54:50,069
Uh-huh.

1224
00:54:50,112 --> 00:54:51,984
Whew. The usual?

1225
00:54:52,027 --> 00:54:55,204
No. Actually, I wanna go on
a little bit of an adventure.

1226
00:54:55,248 --> 00:54:57,685
Gotta work tonight, so
how about you whip me up

1227
00:54:57,729 --> 00:54:58,967
one of those gingerbread lattes

1228
00:54:58,991 --> 00:55:01,123
that Audrey's just been
going on and on about?

1229
00:55:01,167 --> 00:55:03,430
Yeah. Hmm.

1230
00:55:03,474 --> 00:55:05,345
Christmas spirit finally
rubbing off on you.

1231
00:55:05,389 --> 00:55:07,565
Yeah.
Something like that.

1232
00:55:08,392 --> 00:55:10,829
So you know, the vote, uh,

1233
00:55:10,872 --> 00:55:12,874
for the city council's
just in a few days.

1234
00:55:14,354 --> 00:55:16,182
Any idea, Jim, which
way you're leaning?

1235
00:55:16,225 --> 00:55:18,706
Uh, look, I like you, Griff.

1236
00:55:18,750 --> 00:55:20,273
Do you mind if I call you Griff?

1237
00:55:20,317 --> 00:55:24,277
Griff? No one
ever has, but sure.

1238
00:55:24,321 --> 00:55:26,105
Oh, that's surprising.
Seems natural.

1239
00:55:27,062 --> 00:55:29,108
Anyway, uh, as of right now

1240
00:55:29,151 --> 00:55:32,241
there is nowhere else in
Mistletoe for the Coffee Co.

1241
00:55:32,285 --> 00:55:34,983
Now, I've gotta wait and
see if we can save it.

1242
00:55:35,027 --> 00:55:36,637
I mean, you understand, right?

1243
00:55:36,681 --> 00:55:38,160
I understand.

1244
00:55:40,859 --> 00:55:43,731
You know, maybe there's a way

1245
00:55:43,775 --> 00:55:46,430
for the coffee shop
to be at my resort.

1246
00:55:46,473 --> 00:55:49,868
But I thought the Skyridge
Resorts had a direct deal

1247
00:55:49,911 --> 00:55:52,087
with the, uh,
Buckstar coffee chain.

1248
00:55:52,131 --> 00:55:54,829
They do, but it doesn't
have to stay that way.

1249
00:55:58,137 --> 00:55:59,834
Mm. Wow, that tastes like

1250
00:55:59,878 --> 00:56:02,576
liquid fruitcake, but not gross.

1251
00:56:02,620 --> 00:56:04,752
Don't tell Audrey
but she's right.

1252
00:56:05,579 --> 00:56:07,320
I'll tell her.

1253
00:56:07,364 --> 00:56:10,976
Yeah. Hey, Jimbo,
love the scarf on you.

1254
00:56:15,763 --> 00:56:16,851
No.

1255
00:56:16,895 --> 00:56:18,113
Loves it.Yeah.

1256
00:56:25,773 --> 00:56:27,340
Hi. Sorry, guys. Hey!

1257
00:56:27,384 --> 00:56:28,428
Hi.

1258
00:56:28,472 --> 00:56:29,908
I thought we could
use this instead.

1259
00:56:29,951 --> 00:56:31,170
It's a much better lens.

1260
00:56:31,213 --> 00:56:32,693
Oh, my gosh, thank you so much.

1261
00:56:32,737 --> 00:56:34,391
You're welcome. So nice of you.

1262
00:56:34,434 --> 00:56:35,827
I'll take this.
Whoa, wow.Whoa.

1263
00:56:41,223 --> 00:56:44,575
Are you hoping someone
in particular comes?

1264
00:56:45,184 --> 00:56:46,185
What?

1265
00:56:47,012 --> 00:56:49,275
You and that Griffin guy.

1266
00:56:49,318 --> 00:56:51,038
Is there something going
on between you two?

1267
00:56:51,799 --> 00:56:53,975
Bradley, I barely know the guy.

1268
00:56:54,019 --> 00:56:55,586
And he's trying to
take away the thing

1269
00:56:55,629 --> 00:56:57,085
that means the most
to me in this world.

1270
00:56:57,109 --> 00:56:58,110
What do you think?

1271
00:56:58,502 --> 00:56:59,546
Okay.

1272
00:56:59,590 --> 00:57:01,200
Today is about this.

1273
00:57:02,419 --> 00:57:03,724
What about tomorrow?

1274
00:57:03,768 --> 00:57:05,204
What?

1275
00:57:05,247 --> 00:57:06,858
Well, what if
tomorrow was about us?

1276
00:57:08,381 --> 00:57:09,774
A second first date.

1277
00:57:13,125 --> 00:57:15,344
I'd like that. Yeah.

1278
00:57:16,128 --> 00:57:17,825
Great.Okay.

1279
00:57:17,869 --> 00:57:19,827
Great.Okay.

1280
00:57:19,871 --> 00:57:21,786
I'll, uh... I'll go
help with more cameras.

1281
00:57:21,829 --> 00:57:22,917
Thank you.

1282
00:57:33,711 --> 00:57:36,409
Yeah. Dad, hey, thanks
for calling me back.

1283
00:57:36,453 --> 00:57:38,280
I just wanna float
something by you.

1284
00:57:38,324 --> 00:57:39,717
Shoot.

1285
00:57:39,760 --> 00:57:42,633
Okay. One of the things that
makes Mistletoe so great

1286
00:57:42,676 --> 00:57:44,393
is the community of
small businesses, right?

1287
00:57:44,417 --> 00:57:48,116
They're all unique and some
of them are even legacy.

1288
00:57:48,639 --> 00:57:50,249
Okay.

1289
00:57:50,292 --> 00:57:52,096
One of the things we're getting
a little bit of pushback on

1290
00:57:52,120 --> 00:57:54,906
is some of the things we're
offering are in conflict

1291
00:57:54,949 --> 00:57:56,385
and they're... they're worried

1292
00:57:56,429 --> 00:57:58,102
that they'll strain some
of the local businesses.

1293
00:57:58,126 --> 00:58:01,129
Ah, that's par for the course.
Places usually learn to adapt.

1294
00:58:01,173 --> 00:58:04,568
Okay. What if we tailored
the Skyridge Mistletoe Resort

1295
00:58:04,611 --> 00:58:06,831
just a little bit differently?

1296
00:58:06,874 --> 00:58:09,660
You know, not so much the
cookie-cutter approach.

1297
00:58:09,703 --> 00:58:12,010
Ugh. If it ain't
broke, don't fix it.

1298
00:58:12,053 --> 00:58:14,752
That's business 101.

1299
00:58:14,795 --> 00:58:16,955
Be honest son, are you worried
you won't get the votes?

1300
00:58:17,624 --> 00:58:19,017
No. No, no, no.

1301
00:58:19,060 --> 00:58:22,237
I'll get... I'll get the
votes, it's...

1302
00:58:22,281 --> 00:58:24,849
All right, just... Just
forget I called. All right?

1303
00:58:25,980 --> 00:58:27,068
Thanks, Dad.

1304
00:58:29,114 --> 00:58:32,160
Okay, T-minus two
minutes! Places, everyone!

1305
00:58:32,204 --> 00:58:34,162
Room for one more?

1306
00:58:34,206 --> 00:58:35,966
This is the last place
I thought you would be.

1307
00:58:35,990 --> 00:58:38,166
Well, I mean, you know how
good I've gotten at dancing.

1308
00:58:38,210 --> 00:58:39,646
You think I'd miss
an opportunity

1309
00:58:39,690 --> 00:58:41,363
to kick my legs up in the
air over and over again?

1310
00:58:41,387 --> 00:58:42,606
No way, Jose.

1311
00:58:42,649 --> 00:58:43,974
To save the very
thing you wanna take.

1312
00:58:43,998 --> 00:58:47,698
Well, it's great
publicity, right?

1313
00:58:47,741 --> 00:58:52,746
Sure. Or was it possibly the
gingerbread latte you had last night?

1314
00:58:52,790 --> 00:58:54,574
Maybe.Mm-hmm.

1315
00:58:55,880 --> 00:58:57,074
I'm glad you're here.
Come on, get in line.

1316
00:58:57,098 --> 00:58:59,318
All right. Let's line kick.Go.

1317
00:58:59,361 --> 00:59:01,146
Is this thing on?

1318
00:59:01,189 --> 00:59:02,713
Okay, thank you so much.

1319
00:59:02,756 --> 00:59:05,150
First and foremost, I just
wanna say thank you again

1320
00:59:05,193 --> 00:59:07,761
for coming to the Mistletoe
Kickline Fundraiser!

1321
00:59:09,284 --> 00:59:11,548
Thanks to all of you, we are
about to break the record

1322
00:59:11,591 --> 00:59:13,811
for the longest
Christmas kickline

1323
00:59:13,854 --> 00:59:16,727
and save the rec center
while we're at it.

1324
00:59:16,770 --> 00:59:18,816
Whoo!

1325
00:59:18,859 --> 00:59:20,600
Okay, so, I'm gonna
start the music.

1326
00:59:20,644 --> 00:59:22,950
That way you can hear the beat
and then I'll kick you in.

1327
00:59:22,994 --> 00:59:24,125
Okay.

1328
00:59:24,169 --> 00:59:25,387
Are we ready?

1329
00:59:25,431 --> 00:59:27,041
Five, six, seven, eight!

1330
00:59:27,085 --> 00:59:28,652
Step, kick! Step, kick!

1331
00:59:28,695 --> 00:59:30,218
Step, kick! Step, kick!

1332
00:59:32,873 --> 00:59:34,353
Whoo!

1333
00:59:34,396 --> 00:59:36,224
Step kick! Step left!

1334
00:59:36,268 --> 00:59:38,009
Step right! Step left!

1335
00:59:39,010 --> 00:59:41,316
Whoo! Keep going!

1336
00:59:46,104 --> 00:59:47,758
Keep up, everybody!

1337
00:59:51,022 --> 00:59:52,414
Whoo!

1338
00:59:53,938 --> 00:59:56,070
That's right, Mistletoe!

1339
00:59:56,114 --> 00:59:58,333
Keep going! Almost there!

1340
00:59:59,552 --> 01:00:01,380
Here we go! Last four.

1341
01:00:01,423 --> 01:00:05,123
Three, two, one and pose!

1342
01:00:07,473 --> 01:00:09,649
Good job, ladies
and gentlemen! We did it!

1343
01:00:09,693 --> 01:00:13,392
The longest Christmas
kickline in Mistletoe history!

1344
01:00:13,435 --> 01:00:14,915
Whoo!

1345
01:00:16,395 --> 01:00:17,570
That was incredible.

1346
01:00:17,614 --> 01:00:20,225
Oh, my God, thank you.

1347
01:00:20,268 --> 01:00:22,314
You did it! That
was amazing.

1348
01:00:22,357 --> 01:00:26,100
Yeah! Thank you. My
gosh, that was so crazy!

1349
01:00:26,144 --> 01:00:27,798
Bradley, Bradley...

1350
01:00:27,841 --> 01:00:29,626
Jim needs your help
ending the feed.

1351
01:00:29,669 --> 01:00:31,168
I'm worried people are
gonna be seeing him stretch.

1352
01:00:31,192 --> 01:00:32,454
Ooh, on it.

1353
01:00:33,717 --> 01:00:35,327
I would call that a
success. Seriously,

1354
01:00:35,370 --> 01:00:37,242
pledges were coming
in left and right.

1355
01:00:37,285 --> 01:00:39,505
I have a really, really
good feeling about this.

1356
01:00:39,548 --> 01:00:40,549
Yeah?

1357
01:00:41,638 --> 01:00:43,509
Uh-oh. What?

1358
01:00:43,552 --> 01:00:44,597
You like Griffin.

1359
01:00:45,163 --> 01:00:47,556
No. Come on.

1360
01:00:47,600 --> 01:00:49,341
The endorphins got
you all mixed up.

1361
01:00:49,384 --> 01:00:50,472
Oh.

1362
01:00:50,516 --> 01:00:51,822
Bradley's right there.

1363
01:00:52,126 --> 01:00:53,171
Oh.

1364
01:00:53,867 --> 01:00:54,868
Seriously.

1365
01:00:56,957 --> 01:00:58,437
Nothing's going on, nothing.

1366
01:01:00,482 --> 01:01:01,570
Stop it.

1367
01:01:01,614 --> 01:01:02,920
Look at Jim!

1368
01:01:02,963 --> 01:01:04,269
Jimbo,
what is he doing?

1369
01:01:04,312 --> 01:01:07,011
Darlene, CBS Morningshas
mentioned the kickline.

1370
01:01:07,054 --> 01:01:09,883
The video went viral. Look
how many views it has.

1371
01:01:09,927 --> 01:01:11,668
And donations are
still pouring in,

1372
01:01:11,711 --> 01:01:13,060
we only need 20 grand more.

1373
01:01:13,104 --> 01:01:14,409
Look at me go.

1374
01:01:15,889 --> 01:01:18,022
This is wonderful,
Audrey. Well done.

1375
01:01:18,065 --> 01:01:19,850
Round of gingerbread
lattes on the house.

1376
01:01:19,893 --> 01:01:21,808
Yes! Whoo! Whoo!

1377
01:01:21,852 --> 01:01:23,331
Whoa, whoa. What
are we celebrating?

1378
01:01:23,375 --> 01:01:26,247
Well, not to brag, but
numbers are looking good.

1379
01:01:26,291 --> 01:01:28,249
Really? Okay.

1380
01:01:28,293 --> 01:01:29,990
Let me see this. Look
at the comments, too.

1381
01:01:30,034 --> 01:01:31,992
Let me see.

1382
01:01:32,036 --> 01:01:33,622
"That looks like fun.
I'd like to try that.

1383
01:01:33,646 --> 01:01:35,169
"I hear she's a
fitness instructor.

1384
01:01:35,213 --> 01:01:36,649
"I'd take her class."

1385
01:01:36,693 --> 01:01:38,390
Look at that. Wow.

1386
01:01:38,433 --> 01:01:40,784
This is really good, good
publicity for you, too.

1387
01:01:40,827 --> 01:01:42,960
You getting nervous
about the vote tomorrow?

1388
01:01:43,003 --> 01:01:45,571
No. Look it, you still
got a ways to go.

1389
01:01:45,614 --> 01:01:48,617
Hey, people are still
donating. And it's Christmas!

1390
01:01:48,661 --> 01:01:50,619
This is the time for miracles.

1391
01:01:52,404 --> 01:01:55,929
I have never met anybody who
sees the world the way you do.

1392
01:01:57,714 --> 01:02:00,281
No matter what happens here,

1393
01:02:00,325 --> 01:02:03,328
I hope you realize just
how truly amazing you are.

1394
01:02:05,504 --> 01:02:06,897
Gingerbread lattes
for everybody!

1395
01:02:06,940 --> 01:02:10,204
Oh, wow. Oh, yay. Okay.
Whoo. Oh, me, too? Wow.

1396
01:02:10,248 --> 01:02:12,337
Cheers. Cheers.

1397
01:02:12,380 --> 01:02:13,425
Griffin.Cheers.

1398
01:02:13,468 --> 01:02:14,687
Cheers.Thanks.

1399
01:02:23,522 --> 01:02:25,567
Oh, well, look at you.

1400
01:02:25,611 --> 01:02:27,613
What are you all dressed up for?

1401
01:02:27,656 --> 01:02:30,485
Bradley's taking me on
a second first date.

1402
01:02:30,529 --> 01:02:31,922
Oh, so the break is over?

1403
01:02:31,965 --> 01:02:33,706
I'm not sure yet.Huh.

1404
01:02:36,056 --> 01:02:38,058
Dad, I know that look.

1405
01:02:38,102 --> 01:02:39,756
Uh, hey, no judgment.

1406
01:02:39,799 --> 01:02:42,497
Um, I just want you
to be with someone

1407
01:02:42,541 --> 01:02:46,110
who inspires you, and,
you know, sees you.

1408
01:02:47,546 --> 01:02:49,983
Funny. That's what
I want for you, too.

1409
01:02:51,768 --> 01:02:53,030
Darlene, Dad.

1410
01:02:53,857 --> 01:02:55,989
She clearly likes you.

1411
01:02:56,033 --> 01:02:59,297
She's kind, beautiful...

1412
01:02:59,340 --> 01:03:01,516
You seem to avoid her
at every chance you get.

1413
01:03:01,560 --> 01:03:03,605
What's going on? Do
you not like her?

1414
01:03:05,129 --> 01:03:06,652
I do like her.

1415
01:03:06,695 --> 01:03:08,045
So ask her out.

1416
01:03:13,790 --> 01:03:15,748
You know, your mother
was the love of my life.

1417
01:03:17,489 --> 01:03:19,317
Twenty-five wonderful years.

1418
01:03:19,360 --> 01:03:21,014
Losing her was the
most painful thing

1419
01:03:21,058 --> 01:03:22,711
I have ever experienced

1420
01:03:22,755 --> 01:03:25,627
and quite frankly, I'm not
sure I can handle that again.

1421
01:03:25,671 --> 01:03:29,327
Dad, I would hate it if
you missed out on love

1422
01:03:29,370 --> 01:03:30,676
because you were scared.

1423
01:03:32,678 --> 01:03:34,288
You're the bravest man I know.

1424
01:03:34,332 --> 01:03:35,376
Ah.

1425
01:03:36,160 --> 01:03:37,509
You deserve to be happy.

1426
01:03:37,552 --> 01:03:40,077
Don't worry about me, please.

1427
01:03:40,120 --> 01:03:41,861
Mom would want you to be happy.

1428
01:03:47,214 --> 01:03:48,259
That's Bradley.

1429
01:03:49,651 --> 01:03:51,175
You deserve to be happy, too.

1430
01:03:58,617 --> 01:04:00,140
That was delicious.Yeah.

1431
01:04:00,184 --> 01:04:01,248
I wish I could've taken you

1432
01:04:01,272 --> 01:04:02,882
somewhere nicer
for dinner, but...

1433
01:04:02,926 --> 01:04:04,928
Carl's Tavern is nice.

1434
01:04:06,233 --> 01:04:07,776
Well, soon we'll have all
our restaurant options

1435
01:04:07,800 --> 01:04:09,019
back at our fingertips, right?

1436
01:04:09,062 --> 01:04:10,692
Remember that sustainable
sushi restaurant?

1437
01:04:10,716 --> 01:04:12,805
That just opened right
across the street from Solis.

1438
01:04:12,849 --> 01:04:14,328
Oh, spicy tuna...

1439
01:04:14,372 --> 01:04:15,547
Bradley.

1440
01:04:15,590 --> 01:04:19,029
What if I didn't take
the job at Solis?

1441
01:04:19,072 --> 01:04:21,118
And do what instead, freelance?

1442
01:04:22,032 --> 01:04:23,207
Stayed here.

1443
01:04:24,904 --> 01:04:26,993
I really think I'm
gonna save the center

1444
01:04:27,037 --> 01:04:29,169
and these last few
weeks teaching here,

1445
01:04:29,996 --> 01:04:31,650
just feels right.

1446
01:04:31,693 --> 01:04:33,130
Stay in Mistletoe permanently,

1447
01:04:33,173 --> 01:04:35,436
I... I thought you
wanted more than this?

1448
01:04:37,090 --> 01:04:39,658
I haven't decided yet, I...

1449
01:04:39,701 --> 01:04:42,226
Just being back with
my dad and friends,

1450
01:04:42,269 --> 01:04:43,749
I forgot how much I love it.

1451
01:04:43,792 --> 01:04:47,318
Audrey, you're meant for
bigger things than Mistletoe.

1452
01:04:47,361 --> 01:04:49,450
I know it, you know it.

1453
01:04:49,494 --> 01:04:51,975
Just come back to
New York with me.

1454
01:04:52,801 --> 01:04:53,933
I, uh...

1455
01:04:53,977 --> 01:04:56,414
I should've done
this a long time ago.

1456
01:05:02,333 --> 01:05:03,856
I love you, Audrey Parker.

1457
01:05:09,166 --> 01:05:11,472
I know. It's a lot
to spring on you

1458
01:05:11,516 --> 01:05:14,823
and I don't want you to feel
pressured to answer right now.

1459
01:05:14,867 --> 01:05:18,871
Just... just hold
on to it, okay?

1460
01:05:26,487 --> 01:05:30,404
Hmm. Wow.

1461
01:05:31,144 --> 01:05:34,800
It's, um... Wow.

1462
01:05:34,843 --> 01:05:36,454
I know. What did you say?

1463
01:05:36,497 --> 01:05:37,629
Nothing yet.

1464
01:05:37,672 --> 01:05:39,631
What are you going to say?

1465
01:05:39,674 --> 01:05:43,243
I don't know. A part
of me wants to say yes.

1466
01:05:43,287 --> 01:05:44,592
It's what we always planned.

1467
01:05:44,636 --> 01:05:47,769
I know Bradley. I know
what being with him is.

1468
01:05:47,813 --> 01:05:51,077
With this job, things
could be really solid.

1469
01:05:51,121 --> 01:05:54,211
Solid. Not the most
romantic word in the world.

1470
01:05:56,126 --> 01:05:57,257
You just have to figure out

1471
01:05:57,301 --> 01:05:59,694
what it is that you
want in your life.

1472
01:05:59,738 --> 01:06:01,783
Is it to marry Bradley
and work for Solis?

1473
01:06:02,741 --> 01:06:04,612
Or is it something else?

1474
01:06:04,656 --> 01:06:07,920
Solis could put me on the
map. Relaunch my career.

1475
01:06:07,964 --> 01:06:09,704
Bradley and I could
be great together.

1476
01:06:10,401 --> 01:06:12,142
But...

1477
01:06:12,185 --> 01:06:17,625
I just feel like there's
this force or part of me

1478
01:06:17,669 --> 01:06:21,542
that's pulling in the
complete opposite direction.

1479
01:06:21,586 --> 01:06:24,415
Does that direction start with
a "G" and end with a "riffin"?

1480
01:06:29,986 --> 01:06:32,075
Any more donations come in?

1481
01:06:32,118 --> 01:06:34,729
Still short, and the
vote is in a few hours.

1482
01:06:34,773 --> 01:06:37,297
We could all vote no
and buy us more time.

1483
01:06:37,602 --> 01:06:38,907
Maybe.

1484
01:06:38,951 --> 01:06:40,344
The last I checked,

1485
01:06:40,387 --> 01:06:42,085
Jackie still hasn't
made up her mind yet.

1486
01:06:42,128 --> 01:06:43,651
Good.

1487
01:06:43,695 --> 01:06:46,176
Maybe we can find some loans or
state subsidies or something.

1488
01:06:46,219 --> 01:06:47,829
This can't be it.

1489
01:06:47,873 --> 01:06:49,918
I can't have failed
at this, too.

1490
01:06:49,962 --> 01:06:52,834
Do you know why your
kickline video went viral?

1491
01:06:52,878 --> 01:06:55,968
Because everyone loved
it. They loved you.

1492
01:06:56,012 --> 01:06:59,015
And no matter what happens,
I am so proud of you.

1493
01:06:59,841 --> 01:07:00,973
I always will be.

1494
01:07:04,324 --> 01:07:05,456
Thank you.

1495
01:07:05,499 --> 01:07:07,153
All right,
settle down, everyone.

1496
01:07:07,197 --> 01:07:09,547
We're officially calling
this meeting to order

1497
01:07:09,590 --> 01:07:11,984
and tonight's
meeting is to vote on

1498
01:07:12,028 --> 01:07:13,855
whether to approve
the council's decision

1499
01:07:13,899 --> 01:07:17,859
to sell the rec center
property to Skyridge Resorts.

1500
01:07:19,252 --> 01:07:22,560
Dad? Is it okay if
I say something?

1501
01:07:22,603 --> 01:07:23,735
Yes, absolutely.

1502
01:07:23,778 --> 01:07:25,824
The floor recognizes
Audrey Parker.

1503
01:07:29,262 --> 01:07:30,524
I know some of you heard

1504
01:07:30,568 --> 01:07:32,657
that the fundraiser
didn't quite hit our goal.

1505
01:07:33,397 --> 01:07:35,355
But we came close.

1506
01:07:35,399 --> 01:07:37,749
And I still believe
that there is a way

1507
01:07:37,792 --> 01:07:39,751
to raise the rest of the money.

1508
01:07:39,794 --> 01:07:42,667
So I'm asking the council,

1509
01:07:42,710 --> 01:07:45,452
for the sake of those who
gave what they could, please,

1510
01:07:46,584 --> 01:07:49,413
please vote no,

1511
01:07:49,456 --> 01:07:51,980
on selling the center
to Skyridge Resorts.

1512
01:07:53,330 --> 01:07:55,723
Give us more time.

1513
01:07:55,767 --> 01:08:00,076
Even if the rec center stays
empty, at least there's hope.

1514
01:08:02,426 --> 01:08:04,428
And isn't that what
Christmas is all about?

1515
01:08:07,431 --> 01:08:08,475
Thank you.

1516
01:08:10,216 --> 01:08:12,305
Uh, does anyone
have anything else?

1517
01:08:14,829 --> 01:08:16,657
I thought I'd be
hearing from you.

1518
01:08:16,701 --> 01:08:19,006
The floor recognizes
Griffin Weston.

1519
01:08:20,313 --> 01:08:21,313
Thank you.

1520
01:08:26,363 --> 01:08:28,365
Listen, I understand

1521
01:08:28,408 --> 01:08:31,323
you're hesitant to say goodbye
to something so meaningful.

1522
01:08:32,846 --> 01:08:36,720
But I promise you,
Skyridge Resorts

1523
01:08:36,764 --> 01:08:38,462
will do everything that we can

1524
01:08:38,505 --> 01:08:43,510
to make sure that this
town prospers and grows.

1525
01:08:43,554 --> 01:08:48,515
Starting by raising our offer
on the property by $1 million.

1526
01:08:54,478 --> 01:08:55,609
Just think

1527
01:08:56,609 --> 01:08:58,002
of what that'll
do for this town.

1528
01:08:59,613 --> 01:09:00,701
Better schools.

1529
01:09:01,528 --> 01:09:02,616
Better roads.

1530
01:09:03,661 --> 01:09:05,532
Selling us this land will mean

1531
01:09:05,576 --> 01:09:08,448
you won't have to
slash your budgets.

1532
01:09:08,492 --> 01:09:10,102
Thank you. Thank
you for your time.

1533
01:09:14,411 --> 01:09:15,499
Anyone else?

1534
01:09:18,763 --> 01:09:20,678
Then on the matter of

1535
01:09:20,720 --> 01:09:23,810
the Mistletoe rec center property
sale to Skyridge Resorts,

1536
01:09:23,854 --> 01:09:25,377
we will now take a vote.

1537
01:09:25,899 --> 01:09:26,944
Fred?

1538
01:09:28,425 --> 01:09:29,426
Aye.

1539
01:09:30,731 --> 01:09:31,819
Maureen?

1540
01:09:31,863 --> 01:09:32,863
Aye.

1541
01:09:33,473 --> 01:09:34,474
Darlene?

1542
01:09:35,214 --> 01:09:36,214
Nay.

1543
01:09:38,304 --> 01:09:39,392
Jim?

1544
01:09:40,437 --> 01:09:41,437
Nay.

1545
01:09:42,090 --> 01:09:43,135
Bob?

1546
01:09:43,743 --> 01:09:44,745
Aye.

1547
01:09:46,486 --> 01:09:47,661
And I'm a nay.

1548
01:09:50,098 --> 01:09:51,404
Three ayes, three nays.

1549
01:09:52,100 --> 01:09:53,276
That leaves Jackie.

1550
01:09:59,412 --> 01:10:00,413
Aye.

1551
01:10:02,981 --> 01:10:04,025
The ayes have it.

1552
01:10:06,289 --> 01:10:07,290
I'm so sorry.

1553
01:10:08,508 --> 01:10:09,553
I need some air.

1554
01:11:02,258 --> 01:11:03,955
I know you probably
hate me right now.

1555
01:11:06,523 --> 01:11:08,089
But I wanted to
ask you something.

1556
01:11:09,917 --> 01:11:12,529
Dumping money on the
problem at the last minute.

1557
01:11:14,444 --> 01:11:16,968
Dirty tactic.

1558
01:11:20,101 --> 01:11:22,147
I don't hate you.

1559
01:11:22,190 --> 01:11:23,888
I hate the company you work for.

1560
01:11:29,110 --> 01:11:30,242
That's fair.

1561
01:11:32,897 --> 01:11:34,159
What did you wanna ask?

1562
01:11:35,334 --> 01:11:36,640
Okay, if I...

1563
01:11:36,683 --> 01:11:37,858
If I wasn't me...

1564
01:11:39,599 --> 01:11:40,861
Rather, wasn't the one

1565
01:11:40,905 --> 01:11:42,385
that took the rec
center from you.

1566
01:11:45,388 --> 01:11:46,389
Do you think...

1567
01:11:48,478 --> 01:11:50,610
Okay, let's say we bumped
into each other at a bar.

1568
01:11:53,047 --> 01:11:54,179
A juice bar.

1569
01:11:59,706 --> 01:12:05,408
And I... I told you that
I just loved your smile.

1570
01:12:07,105 --> 01:12:09,412
And I really wanted
to get to know you.

1571
01:12:13,851 --> 01:12:15,896
And I'd never met
anyone like you.

1572
01:12:20,771 --> 01:12:23,730
Do you think we
might've hit it off?

1573
01:12:29,214 --> 01:12:30,302
Depends.

1574
01:12:31,521 --> 01:12:32,783
In this hypothetical,

1575
01:12:33,958 --> 01:12:36,308
do you insult my
Christmas decorations?

1576
01:12:38,441 --> 01:12:39,703
No.No?

1577
01:12:39,746 --> 01:12:40,747
Mm-mm.

1578
01:12:42,619 --> 01:12:44,185
Then, yeah.

1579
01:12:45,665 --> 01:12:47,188
Yeah, I think we would.

1580
01:12:58,025 --> 01:13:00,201
I, um... I should go.

1581
01:13:00,245 --> 01:13:02,769
I... I... I didn't know.

1582
01:13:03,509 --> 01:13:06,120
What? Wait.

1583
01:13:06,164 --> 01:13:08,272
No, it's okay, it's okay. You
don't owe me any explanation.

1584
01:13:08,296 --> 01:13:09,733
You... you deserve
to be happy.

1585
01:13:09,776 --> 01:13:12,083
I'm just so happy for you.

1586
01:13:46,770 --> 01:13:48,728
You are so much like your mom.

1587
01:13:51,427 --> 01:13:53,690
I heard you get up. I
figured you'd be here.

1588
01:13:53,733 --> 01:13:55,169
I couldn't sleep, Dad.

1589
01:13:55,213 --> 01:13:57,476
Yeah, me neither.

1590
01:13:57,520 --> 01:13:59,019
Did you hear they cancelled
the Christmas party?

1591
01:13:59,043 --> 01:14:00,087
Oh, yeah.

1592
01:14:01,654 --> 01:14:03,656
Yeah, it sucks. Come on, here.

1593
01:14:09,836 --> 01:14:11,055
How you holding up?

1594
01:14:13,405 --> 01:14:14,928
I'll be okay.

1595
01:14:14,972 --> 01:14:17,191
I just need to decide
what my next step is.

1596
01:14:18,105 --> 01:14:19,890
You know what?

1597
01:14:19,933 --> 01:14:22,501
It was about a month after your
mom got the studio up and running

1598
01:14:22,545 --> 01:14:25,112
and I asked her
if she missed it.

1599
01:14:25,156 --> 01:14:28,376
You know, the city and the
excitement and the lights.

1600
01:14:29,247 --> 01:14:31,031
And you know what she said?

1601
01:14:31,075 --> 01:14:32,555
She said I found
something better.

1602
01:14:33,164 --> 01:14:34,208
You?

1603
01:14:35,993 --> 01:14:37,995
Uh, she was talking
about freedom.

1604
01:14:39,605 --> 01:14:42,303
You know, she could do what
she wanted when she wanted.

1605
01:14:42,347 --> 01:14:44,697
New York was no longer
a dream for her.

1606
01:14:48,048 --> 01:14:50,573
I don't think life's
paths are ever straight.

1607
01:14:51,399 --> 01:14:53,967
They twist, they turn,

1608
01:14:54,011 --> 01:14:57,057
but I do think the best ones
take you to unexpected places.

1609
01:15:12,638 --> 01:15:13,987
Dad?

1610
01:15:14,031 --> 01:15:15,380
What are you doing here?

1611
01:15:15,423 --> 01:15:18,296
I had to come and congratulate
my new COO in person.

1612
01:15:19,819 --> 01:15:21,429
Well done, Griffin.

1613
01:15:21,473 --> 01:15:23,431
You know, that extra
million that you put on top,

1614
01:15:23,475 --> 01:15:24,781
that was smart.

1615
01:15:24,824 --> 01:15:26,609
Right out of my own playbook.

1616
01:15:26,652 --> 01:15:29,525
Do you know the surveyors
will be here on Monday?

1617
01:15:29,568 --> 01:15:32,745
Oh that's, um...
that's... that's good.

1618
01:15:32,789 --> 01:15:35,748
Great. Why don't we go out,
have a nice meal to celebrate.

1619
01:15:35,792 --> 01:15:38,055
They've got places to eat
around here, don't they?

1620
01:15:38,098 --> 01:15:39,926
Yeah, they have a good
gingerbread pancake

1621
01:15:39,970 --> 01:15:43,234
down at Carl's Tavern,
so we'll go there.

1622
01:15:43,277 --> 01:15:47,717
Gingerbread pancakes. Okay.

1623
01:15:47,760 --> 01:15:50,763
They are
all named Carl, on that wall.

1624
01:15:50,807 --> 01:15:53,070
That's certainly
quaint, isn't it?

1625
01:15:53,113 --> 01:15:54,506
Here you are.

1626
01:15:56,116 --> 01:15:57,204
Thank you.

1627
01:15:58,031 --> 01:15:59,119
Enjoy.Yeah.

1628
01:15:59,859 --> 01:16:01,078
Buddy of yours?

1629
01:16:01,121 --> 01:16:02,775
Yeah, we do a fitness
class together.

1630
01:16:02,819 --> 01:16:04,379
Pretty much everybody
here is your buddy.

1631
01:16:05,169 --> 01:16:06,257
You know this is good.

1632
01:16:06,300 --> 01:16:08,955
Yeah. Isn't it?
Tastes like Christmas.

1633
01:16:08,999 --> 01:16:11,915
Sure, I guess so.

1634
01:16:11,958 --> 01:16:13,917
Listen. Griffin,
there's this space

1635
01:16:13,960 --> 01:16:15,788
that's opening up
in the Poconos.

1636
01:16:15,832 --> 01:16:17,137
I want you there Thursday.

1637
01:16:18,965 --> 01:16:21,533
Dad, tell me something.

1638
01:16:21,577 --> 01:16:23,293
What is your favorite
thing about Christmas?

1639
01:16:23,317 --> 01:16:24,492
What?

1640
01:16:24,536 --> 01:16:26,146
Come on. We never
talk about this stuff.

1641
01:16:26,190 --> 01:16:28,061
Just, humor me.

1642
01:16:29,541 --> 01:16:31,282
Okay, well...

1643
01:16:33,371 --> 01:16:35,199
I guess when I was little,

1644
01:16:35,242 --> 01:16:38,202
I got this authentic
toy train set.

1645
01:16:38,245 --> 01:16:40,683
And every year, I looked
forward to getting a new part

1646
01:16:40,726 --> 01:16:43,076
to add to the track.

1647
01:16:43,120 --> 01:16:45,862
I never knew that. That...
that explains a lot.

1648
01:16:47,211 --> 01:16:49,169
Well, your mother was better

1649
01:16:49,213 --> 01:16:51,302
at that sentimental
holiday stuff.

1650
01:16:55,175 --> 01:16:56,220
Dad. Mm?

1651
01:16:58,178 --> 01:16:59,615
I don't wanna be COO.

1652
01:17:01,965 --> 01:17:03,662
What are they putting
in these pancakes?

1653
01:17:03,706 --> 01:17:05,098
Dad, listen to me, listen.

1654
01:17:06,665 --> 01:17:08,580
I have a plan.

1655
01:17:08,624 --> 01:17:10,384
But I need you to have
an open mind for this.

1656
01:17:14,934 --> 01:17:16,893
Hey. I got your message.

1657
01:17:16,936 --> 01:17:19,765
Why do you have to make five dozen
Christmas rolls in two hours?

1658
01:17:19,809 --> 01:17:21,462
You do know the party's
cancelled, right?

1659
01:17:21,506 --> 01:17:23,029
Not anymore.
Haven't you heard?

1660
01:17:23,073 --> 01:17:25,684
It is back on, all
thanks to Griffin. What?

1661
01:17:27,294 --> 01:17:28,992
Darlene,
hey. It's Griffin.

1662
01:17:29,035 --> 01:17:30,796
I know the rec center
Christmas party of yours

1663
01:17:30,820 --> 01:17:32,865
got cancelled after
yesterday's vote

1664
01:17:32,909 --> 01:17:34,301
but I can't let that happen.

1665
01:17:34,345 --> 01:17:35,694
So, party's back on.

1666
01:17:35,738 --> 01:17:37,522
I'll make sure it
all comes together.

1667
01:17:37,565 --> 01:17:40,656
I would love some of those
Christmas rolls if you have time.

1668
01:17:41,308 --> 01:17:42,614
Why is he doing this?

1669
01:17:42,658 --> 01:17:45,399
It's best not to question
a Christmas miracle.

1670
01:17:45,443 --> 01:17:46,705
Come on! Okay.

1671
01:17:55,758 --> 01:17:56,759
Dad.

1672
01:17:58,848 --> 01:17:59,848
I can see it.

1673
01:18:01,198 --> 01:18:02,329
See what?

1674
01:18:03,330 --> 01:18:05,506
What you saw in this place.

1675
01:18:05,550 --> 01:18:07,595
You're not disappointed
in our new arrangement?

1676
01:18:07,639 --> 01:18:11,338
No, no, no. If anything,
I'm, uh, I'm proud.

1677
01:18:12,470 --> 01:18:13,514
Thank you, Dad.

1678
01:18:17,040 --> 01:18:18,041
I love you.

1679
01:18:19,390 --> 01:18:20,478
I love you, Griffin.

1680
01:18:21,958 --> 01:18:25,004
So, where is she?

1681
01:18:25,701 --> 01:18:26,963
Who?

1682
01:18:27,006 --> 01:18:28,965
The one that clearly
inspired all of this.

1683
01:18:29,008 --> 01:18:31,402
No, it's not... It's
not like that. It's...

1684
01:18:41,455 --> 01:18:44,415
Ah, say no more.

1685
01:18:50,160 --> 01:18:51,248
Hey.Hi.

1686
01:18:53,076 --> 01:18:55,687
Griffin, don't give up.

1687
01:18:58,951 --> 01:18:59,996
Thank you, Dad.

1688
01:19:04,609 --> 01:19:06,524
Uh, excuse me, everyone,
just for a moment.

1689
01:19:06,567 --> 01:19:08,091
If I could just
have your attention.

1690
01:19:08,134 --> 01:19:09,222
It'll just take a second.

1691
01:19:09,266 --> 01:19:10,460
First of all...

1692
01:19:10,484 --> 01:19:12,356
I just wanted to,
um, thank you all

1693
01:19:12,399 --> 01:19:14,053
for... for coming on
such short notice.

1694
01:19:14,097 --> 01:19:16,055
I know how much this
party meant to you

1695
01:19:16,099 --> 01:19:17,970
and I wanted to make sure...

1696
01:19:19,711 --> 01:19:22,235
that I... that I made
it happen for you.

1697
01:19:22,279 --> 01:19:24,281
Um, but that's not
the only reason

1698
01:19:24,324 --> 01:19:25,543
that I brought you here.

1699
01:19:25,586 --> 01:19:28,676
I, um, I have some good news.

1700
01:19:28,720 --> 01:19:30,940
At least I hope it's good news.

1701
01:19:30,983 --> 01:19:35,161
I'm happy to announce
that... that the...

1702
01:19:35,205 --> 01:19:39,775
Mistletoe Skyridge will
integrate the rec center

1703
01:19:39,818 --> 01:19:42,386
and all of its offerings
into our new design.

1704
01:19:44,344 --> 01:19:47,913
And, uh, you know, I think
what's really beautiful,

1705
01:19:47,957 --> 01:19:51,308
is the space will be
tailored to Mistletonians

1706
01:19:51,351 --> 01:19:54,833
and everybody else
who lives here.

1707
01:19:54,877 --> 01:19:59,620
Merry Christmas to you and
long live the rec center!

1708
01:20:03,233 --> 01:20:04,234
Yes!

1709
01:20:10,414 --> 01:20:12,218
Oh, if I wasn't
clean eating right now,

1710
01:20:12,242 --> 01:20:14,113
I would devour one of
those Christmas rolls.

1711
01:20:14,157 --> 01:20:15,636
They look delicious, right?

1712
01:20:15,680 --> 01:20:18,074
You're missing out.

1713
01:20:18,117 --> 01:20:20,554
Hey, I found this great
listing, I gotta show you.

1714
01:20:20,598 --> 01:20:23,557
It's a loft in midtown,
so close to Solis.

1715
01:20:23,601 --> 01:20:25,298
It is perfect.

1716
01:20:25,342 --> 01:20:27,823
I'm sorry, Bradley,
I... I can't do it.

1717
01:20:27,866 --> 01:20:29,433
Can't do what?

1718
01:20:29,476 --> 01:20:30,477
Move back to New York.

1719
01:20:32,523 --> 01:20:33,916
I belong here.

1720
01:20:35,004 --> 01:20:36,048
What about our dreams?

1721
01:20:36,875 --> 01:20:39,617
This is my dream.

1722
01:20:39,660 --> 01:20:42,446
I'm going to stay in Mistletoe
and livestream classes.

1723
01:20:43,751 --> 01:20:45,144
Do things my way.

1724
01:20:46,711 --> 01:20:47,712
And us?

1725
01:20:51,672 --> 01:20:53,239
I'll always care about you.

1726
01:20:55,981 --> 01:20:57,021
I'll miss you.

1727
01:21:23,313 --> 01:21:24,880
Did I just see Bradley leave?

1728
01:21:27,839 --> 01:21:28,927
I ended it.

1729
01:21:29,580 --> 01:21:30,581
And?

1730
01:21:31,190 --> 01:21:33,410
It feels right.

1731
01:21:33,453 --> 01:21:36,152
You know what, often the hardest
things are the most worthwhile.

1732
01:21:37,283 --> 01:21:38,371
Come on.

1733
01:21:40,286 --> 01:21:41,635
Thanks, Dad.

1734
01:21:41,679 --> 01:21:42,898
I'm proud of you, sweetheart.

1735
01:21:49,382 --> 01:21:52,037
Dad, why don't you
take your own advice?

1736
01:21:53,430 --> 01:21:55,127
Darlene, Dad.

1737
01:21:55,171 --> 01:21:56,520
Oh... Talk to her.

1738
01:21:58,565 --> 01:22:02,395
Um, I don't know how
to do that anymore.

1739
01:22:02,439 --> 01:22:04,615
Go ask her to dance.Uh...

1740
01:22:07,487 --> 01:22:08,749
Go.All right.

1741
01:22:14,146 --> 01:22:15,278
Go!

1742
01:22:23,764 --> 01:22:27,116
Can I cut in,
please? Thank you.

1743
01:22:27,159 --> 01:22:29,857
You look very handsome
tonight, Edgar.

1744
01:22:29,901 --> 01:22:31,685
Thank you, Darlene.
You look...

1745
01:22:31,729 --> 01:22:32,948
You look absolutely beautiful.

1746
01:22:35,907 --> 01:22:37,865
Uh, do you think that,

1747
01:22:37,909 --> 01:22:39,998
uh, in the very
near future that...

1748
01:22:42,044 --> 01:22:43,175
you could have dinner...

1749
01:22:47,049 --> 01:22:48,093
with me?

1750
01:22:51,227 --> 01:22:53,185
What took you so long?

1751
01:22:53,969 --> 01:22:54,970
I'd love to.

1752
01:22:59,452 --> 01:23:00,453
Oh.

1753
01:23:03,239 --> 01:23:06,938
Ah, imagine all the tourists
that will come to ski

1754
01:23:06,982 --> 01:23:09,593
but stay for
Mistletoe Coffee Co.

1755
01:23:09,636 --> 01:23:11,116
I would say that this news is

1756
01:23:11,160 --> 01:23:13,379
the best Christmas present ever.

1757
01:23:13,423 --> 01:23:15,623
I don't know, I think I have
something that might top it.

1758
01:23:16,817 --> 01:23:18,254
Oh, sweetie, I thought we said

1759
01:23:18,297 --> 01:23:20,299
we weren't gonna do
presents until tomorrow.

1760
01:23:20,343 --> 01:23:22,040
Just open it.Okay.

1761
01:23:27,915 --> 01:23:33,573
Wait. Wait, are... you're...
is this... we're...

1762
01:23:33,617 --> 01:23:35,445
I mean you, mainly, but we're...

1763
01:23:35,488 --> 01:23:36,489
Yes.

1764
01:23:41,668 --> 01:23:44,584
Wow. Uh, let's
name him Griffin.

1765
01:23:45,977 --> 01:23:48,153
What? Joke. I'm
joking. It's a joke.

1766
01:23:58,772 --> 01:24:02,254
Who knew Griffin Weston could
throw a Christmas party?

1767
01:24:04,561 --> 01:24:08,130
Well,
I had some help

1768
01:24:08,173 --> 01:24:11,437
and it's just all about
capturing a feeling.

1769
01:24:11,481 --> 01:24:12,612
Oh.

1770
01:24:18,140 --> 01:24:19,576
You look stunning.

1771
01:24:22,144 --> 01:24:23,362
Not so bad yourself.

1772
01:24:26,191 --> 01:24:29,064
So, was all that true?

1773
01:24:29,107 --> 01:24:32,980
About saving the rec center
and keeping it as is?

1774
01:24:33,981 --> 01:24:35,157
Every word of it.

1775
01:24:36,114 --> 01:24:37,178
Yeah, we're gonna find a way

1776
01:24:37,202 --> 01:24:39,161
to build it into
the whole system.

1777
01:24:39,204 --> 01:24:43,208
I'm
shocked. Elated.

1778
01:24:43,252 --> 01:24:46,081
Just... shocked.

1779
01:24:46,864 --> 01:24:48,083
It's all because of you.

1780
01:24:49,606 --> 01:24:51,912
You inspired me to
follow my own path.

1781
01:24:53,262 --> 01:24:55,438
You showed me how
special this town was,

1782
01:24:55,481 --> 01:24:58,093
how special
Christmas was, how...

1783
01:25:00,356 --> 01:25:01,661
how special you are.

1784
01:25:03,837 --> 01:25:05,448
Now, I know you're engaged...

1785
01:25:05,491 --> 01:25:06,536
I'm not engaged.

1786
01:25:07,841 --> 01:25:09,121
I know you saw me with the ring,

1787
01:25:09,147 --> 01:25:11,106
and then, we were talking and...

1788
01:25:13,282 --> 01:25:15,197
I just needed you to know that.

1789
01:25:15,240 --> 01:25:16,546
So you two...

1790
01:25:16,589 --> 01:25:18,200
Are over. Over.

1791
01:25:22,117 --> 01:25:23,509
Really? Yeah.

1792
01:25:24,684 --> 01:25:25,859
That's great.

1793
01:25:26,991 --> 01:25:29,428
I mean... I'm sorry.

1794
01:25:29,472 --> 01:25:31,909
I mean, "Oh, no."

1795
01:25:33,693 --> 01:25:34,738
Are you okay?

1796
01:25:36,870 --> 01:25:37,915
Stop.

1797
01:25:40,135 --> 01:25:44,922
You know, it turns out,
you're pretty inspiring, too.

1798
01:25:44,965 --> 01:25:47,142
Really? Is that so?

1799
01:25:48,534 --> 01:25:50,710
Well, your whole
livestream idea,

1800
01:25:50,754 --> 01:25:52,756
it helped me figure
out my new path.

1801
01:25:52,799 --> 01:25:55,280
And I'll be able to
teach all my classes

1802
01:25:55,324 --> 01:25:56,977
right here in Mistletoe.

1803
01:25:57,021 --> 01:25:59,241
To reach anyone, anywhere.

1804
01:25:59,284 --> 01:26:03,158
Funny thing about that
is I'm staying here, too.

1805
01:26:03,201 --> 01:26:05,769
You're looking at the new
operations manager of the resort.

1806
01:26:05,812 --> 01:26:07,901
Oh.

1807
01:26:07,945 --> 01:26:11,688
I have to stay here to make sure
that my vision becomes a reality.

1808
01:26:11,731 --> 01:26:15,605
So we'll both be
here... together.

1809
01:26:16,693 --> 01:26:18,434
Yeah.Hmm.

1810
01:26:21,176 --> 01:26:22,656
Well, would
you look at that!

1811
01:26:23,221 --> 01:26:24,309
Mistletoe.

1812
01:26:25,876 --> 01:26:29,096
Someone once told me it's
not to be messed with.
