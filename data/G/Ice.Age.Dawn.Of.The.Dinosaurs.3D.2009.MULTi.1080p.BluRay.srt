1
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:17,785
It's happening!

2
00:03:21,955 --> 00:03:23,582
Wait up, guys!

3
00:03:31,965 --> 00:03:33,425
The baby's coming! The baby's coming!

4
00:03:33,550 --> 00:03:35,010
- Watch it!
- I'm having a baby!

5
00:03:35,135 --> 00:03:38,514
- Code Blue! Code Blue!
- Or pink if it's a girl!

6
00:03:38,639 --> 00:03:41,767
Having a baby! Having a baby!
I'm coming, Ellie!

7
00:03:42,184 --> 00:03:43,519
We got it!

8
00:03:57,574 --> 00:03:59,118
Ellie! Ellie!

9
00:03:59,243 --> 00:04:02,287
Ellie, where are you? Where am I?

10
00:04:02,412 --> 00:04:03,539
Manny?

11
00:04:04,581 --> 00:04:06,875
I told you it was just a kick.

12
00:04:10,003 --> 00:04:12,964
Right! Right! Wow.

13
00:04:14,132 --> 00:04:18,428
You really gave Daddy a scare!
Daddy got silly!

14
00:04:18,553 --> 00:04:21,806
Daddy fall down cliff
and go boom, boom, boom.

15
00:04:21,931 --> 00:04:24,725
Silly Daddy. Yeah.

16
00:04:29,063 --> 00:04:32,483
Sorry, folks! False alarm!
It was just a kick!

17
00:04:34,026 --> 00:04:37,488
- You know who I'd like to kick?
- That's the third false alarm this week.

18
00:04:37,613 --> 00:04:40,867
All right, show's over, break it up!
Break it up!

19
00:04:41,617 --> 00:04:44,537
I see someone else
who has a bun in the oven!

20
00:04:45,037 --> 00:04:46,789
I'm not pregnant!

21
00:04:47,957 --> 00:04:50,918
That's too bad.
You'd make a wonderful mother!

22
00:04:52,086 --> 00:04:57,008
Manny, I know you're excited. I am, too.
But you're getting a little carried away.

23
00:04:57,133 --> 00:05:01,888
Okay, okay!
Boy, you're starting to sound like Diego.

24
00:05:02,930 --> 00:05:05,224
Wait a second. Where is Diego?

25
00:06:00,904 --> 00:06:04,032
My hooves are burning, baby!
They are burning!

26
00:06:04,950 --> 00:06:06,910
Look at this. I got to tip-toe!
I got to tip-toe!

27
00:06:07,035 --> 00:06:08,787
Eat my dust, dingo!

28
00:06:12,207 --> 00:06:14,668
Now? Can I look now?

29
00:06:15,043 --> 00:06:17,587
Easy. Don't freak out the baby.

30
00:06:17,712 --> 00:06:21,466
The baby's fine. It's the freaked-out daddy
I'm worried about.

31
00:06:21,842 --> 00:06:23,427
No peeking!

32
00:06:24,678 --> 00:06:27,264
VoilÃ ! Playground for Junior!

33
00:06:29,015 --> 00:06:30,058
Wow.

34
00:06:37,691 --> 00:06:40,152
It's amazing!

35
00:06:51,496 --> 00:06:52,748
Manny.

36
00:06:52,873 --> 00:06:55,625
I made it myself. Our family.

37
00:07:02,174 --> 00:07:03,884
Hey, why aren't I up there?

38
00:07:04,009 --> 00:07:07,554
- You can be on ours.
- You'd fit right in!

39
00:07:08,263 --> 00:07:09,639
Thanks!

40
00:07:09,765 --> 00:07:14,561
Of course, it's still a work in progress.
A few rough edges here and there.

41
00:07:15,479 --> 00:07:18,690
I don't believe it.
You're trying to baby-proof nature.

42
00:07:18,815 --> 00:07:22,569
Baby-proof nature? Get out of here.
That's ridiculous.

43
00:07:25,697 --> 00:07:28,658
Manny, this is the world our baby's
gonna grow up in.

44
00:07:28,784 --> 00:07:29,951
You can't change that.

45
00:07:30,076 --> 00:07:33,330
Of course I can.
I'm the biggest thing on Earth!

46
00:07:33,455 --> 00:07:37,918
Okay, Big Daddy. I can't wait to see
how you handle the teen years.

47
00:07:41,129 --> 00:07:44,174
Come on, Sid!
I don't want you touching anything.

48
00:07:44,299 --> 00:07:47,177
This place is for kids. Are you a kid?

49
00:07:47,761 --> 00:07:49,553
Don't answer that.

50
00:08:01,816 --> 00:08:03,526
Diego! There you are.

51
00:08:03,651 --> 00:08:05,069
You missed the big surprise!

52
00:08:05,194 --> 00:08:08,072
Right. Right. I'll check it out later.

53
00:08:08,197 --> 00:08:09,740
Okay. See you.

54
00:08:10,658 --> 00:08:13,202
You know, I think there's
something bothering Diego.

55
00:08:13,327 --> 00:08:15,204
No, I'm sure everything's fine.

56
00:08:15,329 --> 00:08:16,414
You should talk to him.

57
00:08:16,539 --> 00:08:19,208
Guys don't talk to guys
about guy problems.

58
00:08:19,333 --> 00:08:22,169
We just punch each other
on the shoulders.

59
00:08:22,878 --> 00:08:24,213
That's stupid.

60
00:08:24,338 --> 00:08:28,384
To a girl. To a guy,
that's like six months of therapy.

61
00:08:29,969 --> 00:08:32,096
Okay, okay, I'm going.

62
00:08:36,308 --> 00:08:37,393
Hey.

63
00:08:41,105 --> 00:08:42,731
Why'd you do that?

64
00:08:43,190 --> 00:08:44,650
I don't know.

65
00:08:46,569 --> 00:08:47,987
So, listen,

66
00:08:48,612 --> 00:08:52,324
Ellie thinks there's
something bothering you. I told her...

67
00:08:52,450 --> 00:08:55,119
Actually, I've been thinking that soon

68
00:08:55,244 --> 00:08:57,913
it might be time for me to head out.

69
00:08:58,789 --> 00:09:02,585
Okay. So I'll just tell her that you're fine.
It was nothing.

70
00:09:02,710 --> 00:09:06,172
Look, who are we kidding, Manny?
I'm losing my edge.

71
00:09:06,297 --> 00:09:09,133
I'm not really built
for chaperoning play dates.

72
00:09:09,258 --> 00:09:10,593
What are you talking about?

73
00:09:10,718 --> 00:09:13,846
Having a family, that's huge,
and I'm happy for you,

74
00:09:13,971 --> 00:09:16,849
but that's your adventure, not mine.

75
00:09:17,641 --> 00:09:20,436
- So you don't want to be around my kid?
- No, no, no. That's...

76
00:09:20,561 --> 00:09:22,521
- You're taking this the wrong way.
- No, go.

77
00:09:22,646 --> 00:09:26,358
Go find some adventure,
Mr. Adventure Guy.

78
00:09:26,484 --> 00:09:30,988
Don't let my boring domestic life
hit you in the butt on the way out.

79
00:09:31,113 --> 00:09:34,950
Isn't Ellie supposed to be the one
with the hormonal imbalance?

80
00:09:35,075 --> 00:09:37,577
Manny, wait! No one has to leave.

81
00:09:39,162 --> 00:09:42,373
- So?
- That's why guys don't talk to guys.

82
00:09:42,499 --> 00:09:45,627
- Why? What happened?
- Diego's leaving.

83
00:09:49,506 --> 00:09:53,384
This should be the best time of our lives.
We're having a baby!

84
00:09:53,510 --> 00:09:55,845
No, Sid. They're having a baby.

85
00:09:56,846 --> 00:09:59,808
Yeah, but we're a herd, a family.

86
00:10:01,017 --> 00:10:04,646
Look, things have changed.
Manny has other priorities now.

87
00:10:05,688 --> 00:10:10,276
Face it, Sid. We had a great run,
but now it's time to move on.

88
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:13,988
So it's just the two of us.

89
00:10:14,364 --> 00:10:16,825
No, Sid, it's not the two of us.

90
00:10:17,784 --> 00:10:20,328
Crash and Eddie are coming with us?

91
00:10:21,371 --> 00:10:22,831
Just Crash?

92
00:10:24,374 --> 00:10:25,792
Just Eddie?

93
00:10:27,877 --> 00:10:29,212
Bye, Sid.

94
00:10:41,391 --> 00:10:44,310
Okay, calm down. Calm down.

95
00:10:44,436 --> 00:10:48,940
I'm good at making friends.
I'll make my own herd. That's what I'll do.

96
00:10:49,065 --> 00:10:51,526
Patty cake, patty cake, baker's man...

97
00:11:01,870 --> 00:11:04,664
Well, at least you still got your looks.

98
00:11:16,050 --> 00:11:17,093
Great.

99
00:11:24,976 --> 00:11:28,061
Anybody here? Anyone?

100
00:11:48,248 --> 00:11:49,583
Hello?

101
00:11:56,924 --> 00:12:00,552
Poor guys. I know what it's like
to feel abandoned.

102
00:12:07,059 --> 00:12:09,937
Don't worry. You're not alone anymore.

103
00:12:42,678 --> 00:12:44,138
There you go.

104
00:12:50,644 --> 00:12:53,021
Okay, okay. I'm okay, I'm okay.

105
00:12:58,360 --> 00:13:01,155
Stay here. Stay here. And you,
you take care of your brother, now.

106
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:02,823
Momma's gonna be right back.

107
00:13:02,948 --> 00:13:04,741
Momma's coming, baby!

108
00:13:11,874 --> 00:13:13,167
Gotcha!

109
00:13:16,544 --> 00:13:18,796
What did I just tell you kids?

110
00:14:25,905 --> 00:14:28,199
Thank you, thank you, thank you!

111
00:14:28,741 --> 00:14:30,326
Bad egg. Rotten egg!

112
00:14:30,451 --> 00:14:32,954
A heart attack you almost gave me!

113
00:14:33,287 --> 00:14:36,541
I'm sorry, darling.
It's just that I love you so much.

114
00:14:36,666 --> 00:14:39,752
Now, I want you to meet
your Uncle Manny and your Aunt Ellie.

115
00:14:39,877 --> 00:14:42,255
- Hi!
- Hello.

116
00:14:42,630 --> 00:14:46,426
I'd like to present Egbert, Shelly and Yoko.

117
00:14:46,843 --> 00:14:50,263
Sid, whatever you're doing, it's a bad idea.

118
00:14:51,180 --> 00:14:52,682
My kids will hear you!

119
00:14:52,807 --> 00:14:55,893
They're not your kids, Sid.
Take them back.

120
00:14:56,018 --> 00:14:58,438
- You're not meant to be a parent.
- Why not?

121
00:14:58,563 --> 00:15:01,065
First sign, stealing someone else's eggs.

122
00:15:01,190 --> 00:15:04,317
Second sign, one of them
almost became an omelet.

123
00:15:05,402 --> 00:15:08,238
Sid, someone's probably
worried sick looking for them.

124
00:15:08,363 --> 00:15:10,782
No. They were underground, in ice.

125
00:15:10,907 --> 00:15:14,619
If it wasn't for me, they'd be Eggsicles.

126
00:15:16,496 --> 00:15:18,749
Sid, I know what you're going through.

127
00:15:18,874 --> 00:15:21,126
You're gonna have a family, too, someday.

128
00:15:21,251 --> 00:15:24,838
You're gonna meet a nice girl
with low standards,

129
00:15:24,963 --> 00:15:28,091
no real options or sense of smell...

130
00:15:28,216 --> 00:15:29,551
What Manny means to say is...

131
00:15:29,676 --> 00:15:32,137
No, I get it. I'll take them back.

132
00:15:32,971 --> 00:15:37,225
You have your family,
and I'm better off alone, by myself.

133
00:15:39,019 --> 00:15:40,937
A fortress of solitude.

134
00:15:42,355 --> 00:15:43,982
In the ice

135
00:15:44,858 --> 00:15:46,276
forever!

136
00:15:46,985 --> 00:15:49,196
A lone, lonely loner!

137
00:15:50,197 --> 00:15:52,908
- That's a lot of aloneness.
- Precisely!

138
00:15:53,700 --> 00:15:57,829
- Sid, wait!
- No! No, it's okay. He'll bounce back.

139
00:15:58,205 --> 00:16:01,041
It's one of the advantages of being Sid.

140
00:16:10,550 --> 00:16:14,971
Why should I take you back? I love kids!

141
00:16:15,097 --> 00:16:18,308
I'm responsible, loving, nurturing.

142
00:16:19,601 --> 00:16:21,311
What do you think?

143
00:16:23,063 --> 00:16:25,023
I knew you would agree.

144
00:16:27,776 --> 00:16:31,154
Don't cry! Don't cry.

145
00:16:31,279 --> 00:16:32,948
I'll find a dry place.

146
00:16:36,910 --> 00:16:37,953
Okay.

147
00:16:39,287 --> 00:16:41,331
Here, let me just dry you off.

148
00:16:46,253 --> 00:16:49,297
I don't know.
Being a parent's a lot of work.

149
00:16:50,382 --> 00:16:52,217
Maybe I'm not ready.

150
00:18:29,980 --> 00:18:31,107
Momma!

151
00:18:31,232 --> 00:18:33,776
Momma! Momma! Momma!

152
00:18:37,488 --> 00:18:38,906
I'm a mommy.

153
00:18:41,450 --> 00:18:43,118
Where's Mommy?

154
00:18:45,370 --> 00:18:46,830
Here I am.

155
00:18:49,707 --> 00:18:52,168
There you go. Nice squeaky faces.

156
00:19:08,726 --> 00:19:10,520
I got it! I got it!

157
00:19:15,525 --> 00:19:18,695
No, no! Stop! Not me! No, stop, stop!

158
00:19:21,072 --> 00:19:22,657
Hey! No biting!

159
00:19:26,411 --> 00:19:30,123
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
No. It's okay, it's okay. Don't cry.

160
00:19:30,248 --> 00:19:32,959
Why are you still crying? Are you hungry?

161
00:19:33,084 --> 00:19:36,087
Maybe you're hungry.
I know just the thing.

162
00:19:38,548 --> 00:19:42,886
Hush, hush
You mean, vicious animal

163
00:19:43,386 --> 00:19:48,057
I'm your baby and this is my milk

164
00:19:51,269 --> 00:19:53,730
I thought you were a female!

165
00:21:19,356 --> 00:21:23,861
I'm sorry, but you can't go in.
Manny says it's just for kids.

166
00:21:25,237 --> 00:21:27,448
Wait a minute. You are kids!

167
00:21:30,743 --> 00:21:32,953
Just don't break anything!

168
00:21:34,037 --> 00:21:36,665
The sloth says the playground's open!

169
00:21:38,083 --> 00:21:40,335
No, wait! Not for everyone!

170
00:21:45,466 --> 00:21:47,760
No, no, no! Don't touch that!

171
00:21:53,891 --> 00:21:57,019
- What are they?
- Who cares? They're fun!

172
00:21:57,144 --> 00:21:59,855
- Play nice!
- Mommy, he's not sharing!

173
00:21:59,980 --> 00:22:03,025
- Aren't you going to do something?
- Why? My kid had it first.

174
00:22:03,150 --> 00:22:04,485
- Did not!
- Did, too!

175
00:22:04,610 --> 00:22:05,944
- Did not!
- Did, too!

176
00:22:06,070 --> 00:22:08,864
- Did not!
- Liar, liar, fur on fire!

177
00:22:08,989 --> 00:22:10,532
What is the matter with you?

178
00:22:10,657 --> 00:22:14,870
I'm a single mother with three kids.
I could use a little compassion!

179
00:22:15,913 --> 00:22:17,456
Slow down! No!

180
00:22:17,581 --> 00:22:18,957
No, don't...

181
00:22:19,373 --> 00:22:21,000
Stop, stop, stop!

182
00:22:22,835 --> 00:22:25,296
- Ronald!
- That's a shame.

183
00:22:30,259 --> 00:22:32,386
Stop! Stop, stop, stop!

184
00:22:33,262 --> 00:22:34,555
No! No!

185
00:22:36,766 --> 00:22:39,977
- Hold on, Little Johnny!
- I'm trying!

186
00:22:43,773 --> 00:22:47,693
You know, experts say you should
let the kids eat whatever they want!

187
00:22:48,569 --> 00:22:50,363
Do you think my ankles look fat?

188
00:22:50,488 --> 00:22:52,281
Ankles? What ankles?

189
00:22:56,786 --> 00:22:59,122
Ronald! Where did you come from?

190
00:23:01,541 --> 00:23:03,000
Oh, no.

191
00:23:04,502 --> 00:23:06,629
Okay, come on. Spit him out.

192
00:23:07,171 --> 00:23:08,631
If you don't spit out Little Johnny,

193
00:23:08,756 --> 00:23:11,050
we're leaving the playground this instant!

194
00:23:11,175 --> 00:23:12,343
One,

195
00:23:12,844 --> 00:23:14,137
two...

196
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:17,014
Don't make me say "three"!

197
00:23:18,599 --> 00:23:21,269
There we are. A picture of health.

198
00:23:21,394 --> 00:23:23,855
- That's not Little Johnny.
- Well, better than nothing.

199
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:25,940
Madison!

200
00:23:26,649 --> 00:23:29,277
- Come on, barf him up.
- Sid?

201
00:23:29,986 --> 00:23:32,071
Hey. Hey, Manny.

202
00:23:33,030 --> 00:23:34,657
Little Johnny!

203
00:23:38,494 --> 00:23:40,121
Wait! No, no...

204
00:23:42,874 --> 00:23:44,667
I'm really sorry.

205
00:23:51,174 --> 00:23:54,635
- This place is totaled.
- And we didn't wreck it.

206
00:23:54,761 --> 00:23:55,803
We're losing our touch, bro.

207
00:23:55,803 --> 00:23:56,846
We're losing our touch, bro.

208
00:23:58,014 --> 00:24:00,641
Well, the important thing is
that no one got hurt.

209
00:24:01,434 --> 00:24:02,727
Except for that guy.

210
00:24:03,019 --> 00:24:04,145
And those three.

211
00:24:05,396 --> 00:24:06,439
And her.

212
00:24:09,107 --> 00:24:12,360
I told you to take them back,
and you kept them!

213
00:24:12,486 --> 00:24:13,570
Now look what they've done!

214
00:24:13,695 --> 00:24:16,114
Okay, granted,
we do have some discipline issues.

215
00:24:16,239 --> 00:24:18,408
Eating kids is not a discipline issue!

216
00:24:18,533 --> 00:24:21,161
- But he spit them out.
- Well, that's super.

217
00:24:21,286 --> 00:24:24,164
Let's give him a gold star! Kid of the week!

218
00:24:24,623 --> 00:24:26,166
They don't belong here, Sid.

219
00:24:26,291 --> 00:24:30,128
Whatever they are,
wherever you found them, take them back.

220
00:24:30,253 --> 00:24:32,839
Manny! I'm not getting rid of my kids!

221
00:24:35,050 --> 00:24:36,676
Earthquake!

222
00:24:38,553 --> 00:24:41,348
It's okay, it's okay. Momma's here.

223
00:24:43,892 --> 00:24:45,727
Do earthquakes shriek?

224
00:25:14,339 --> 00:25:16,049
I thought those guys were extinct!

225
00:25:16,174 --> 00:25:19,719
Well, then that is one angry fossil. Sid!

226
00:25:21,054 --> 00:25:23,390
Come on, come on! Inside, inside, inside!

227
00:25:40,323 --> 00:25:43,243
Nobody move a muscle.

228
00:26:14,398 --> 00:26:17,193
No, no, no, don't cry. Don't cry.

229
00:26:19,987 --> 00:26:23,616
We are poor, little lambs
who have lost our way

230
00:26:36,837 --> 00:26:40,633
Sid! Give them to her! She's their mother!

231
00:26:40,758 --> 00:26:42,593
How do I know she's their mother?

232
00:26:42,718 --> 00:26:46,138
What do you want, a birth certificate?
She's a dinosaur!

233
00:26:46,263 --> 00:26:50,017
Well, I put in the blood, sweat and tears
to raise them!

234
00:26:50,142 --> 00:26:52,978
For a day! Give them back, you lunatic!

235
00:26:53,104 --> 00:26:55,398
Look, these are my kids,

236
00:26:56,399 --> 00:26:59,735
and you're gonna have to go through me
to get them!

237
00:27:05,282 --> 00:27:06,575
- Sid!
- Sid!

238
00:27:08,035 --> 00:27:09,328
Help!

239
00:27:15,709 --> 00:27:17,169
Run!

240
00:27:17,461 --> 00:27:19,755
Don't you have anything better to do?

241
00:27:24,343 --> 00:27:25,511
Sid?

242
00:27:41,694 --> 00:27:43,654
Sid must be down there.

243
00:27:44,071 --> 00:27:46,448
- Well, he's dead.
- Real shame.

244
00:27:46,573 --> 00:27:48,241
He will be missed.

245
00:27:48,825 --> 00:27:51,369
Oh, no, no, no. Not so fast.

246
00:27:51,494 --> 00:27:54,038
Okay, Ellie, this is where I draw the line.

247
00:27:54,164 --> 00:27:56,666
You, Crash and Eddie, back to the village.

248
00:27:56,791 --> 00:27:58,376
Yeah, that's gonna happen.

249
00:27:58,501 --> 00:28:02,338
Ellie, you saw that thing!
This is gonna be dangerous!

250
00:28:02,464 --> 00:28:03,798
Talk to the trunk.

251
00:28:03,923 --> 00:28:07,260
Great. After we save Sid,
I'm gonna kill him.

252
00:28:09,262 --> 00:28:11,431
- Ladies first.
- Age before beauty.

253
00:28:11,556 --> 00:28:13,725
- No pain, no gain.
- What pain?

254
00:28:24,736 --> 00:28:27,489
- Sid!
- Sid!

255
00:28:38,416 --> 00:28:42,420
Oh, no. No, no. Not good, not good.

256
00:28:44,589 --> 00:28:46,716
Ellie! Ellie, wait up!

257
00:28:49,969 --> 00:28:52,472
Okay, look, if you feel anything,

258
00:28:52,597 --> 00:28:55,975
even if it's nothing, you gotta tell me,
and then we're out of here.

259
00:28:56,101 --> 00:28:57,227
Okay.

260
00:28:57,685 --> 00:28:59,104
We need a code word!

261
00:28:59,229 --> 00:29:02,357
Yeah. Something that says,
"The baby's coming."

262
00:29:03,274 --> 00:29:07,070
How about, "The baby's coming!"
How's that?

263
00:29:07,821 --> 00:29:11,783
Too long. We need something
short and punchy, like...

264
00:29:11,908 --> 00:29:12,992
"Peaches!"

265
00:29:13,118 --> 00:29:15,453
- Peaches?
- I love peaches.

266
00:29:15,578 --> 00:29:19,624
They're sweet and round and fuzzy,
just like you.

267
00:29:19,749 --> 00:29:21,459
You think I'm round?

268
00:29:22,710 --> 00:29:25,922
Round is good. Round is foxy.

269
00:29:37,516 --> 00:29:38,851
Stay close.

270
00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:02,416
Are you guys
having the same dream I am?

271
00:30:02,541 --> 00:30:06,962
We've been living above an entire world,
and we didn't even know it.

272
00:30:30,486 --> 00:30:33,322
Run for it! Hurry!

273
00:30:40,287 --> 00:30:43,832
- Diego, what are you doing here?
- Sightseeing!

274
00:30:43,957 --> 00:30:47,211
- I'm looking for Sid, same as you.
- Well! Aren't you noble?

275
00:30:47,336 --> 00:30:51,215
This is not the time, guys!
We need all the help we can get!

276
00:31:02,017 --> 00:31:03,435
Never mind.

277
00:31:13,487 --> 00:31:16,949
Here, boy! Here! Come on!
Good boy! Come on!

278
00:31:17,658 --> 00:31:19,535
- Climb on.
- Are you nuts?

279
00:31:19,660 --> 00:31:20,869
We're not getting on that thing!

280
00:31:20,994 --> 00:31:23,622
It's either this dinosaur or that one!

281
00:31:26,833 --> 00:31:30,294
Pregnant lady wants to live!
Yabba-dabba-doo!

282
00:31:42,014 --> 00:31:45,017
Don't ever yabba-dabba do that again!

283
00:31:50,773 --> 00:31:55,361
- I feel so puny.
- How do you think I feel?

284
00:32:18,968 --> 00:32:20,511
Take cover!

285
00:33:09,018 --> 00:33:12,188
Dude, you're awesome!
You're like the brother I never had!

286
00:33:12,313 --> 00:33:13,647
Me, too!

287
00:33:26,535 --> 00:33:28,078
Can we keep him?

288
00:33:30,831 --> 00:33:32,290
- Buck!
- What?

289
00:33:32,541 --> 00:33:35,252
The name's Buck. Short for Buckminster.

290
00:33:36,461 --> 00:33:38,755
Long for "Buh."

291
00:33:41,133 --> 00:33:42,676
A little dull.

292
00:33:44,469 --> 00:33:46,138
What are you doing here?

293
00:33:46,263 --> 00:33:48,807
- Our friend was taken by a dinosaur.
- Well!

294
00:33:49,558 --> 00:33:53,603
He's dead. Welcome to my world.
Now go home.

295
00:33:53,937 --> 00:33:55,897
- Off you pop.
- Not without Sid.

296
00:33:56,022 --> 00:33:59,401
Ellie, wait.
Maybe the deranged hermit has a point.

297
00:33:59,526 --> 00:34:02,112
Manny, we came this far,
we're gonna find him.

298
00:34:02,237 --> 00:34:03,780
I got tracks.

299
00:34:06,199 --> 00:34:07,492
Let's go.

300
00:34:10,203 --> 00:34:12,414
If you go in there, you'll find your friend.

301
00:34:13,415 --> 00:34:15,208
In the afterlife.

302
00:34:15,709 --> 00:34:19,004
How do you know,
O Great and Wisely Weasely One?

303
00:34:27,304 --> 00:34:28,305
Yeah.

304
00:34:28,430 --> 00:34:33,226
Mommy dinosaur carrying her three babies
and some floppy green thing.

305
00:34:34,186 --> 00:34:36,605
Yeah, we're friends
with the floppy green thing.

306
00:34:36,730 --> 00:34:38,482
You got all that from the tracks?

307
00:34:38,607 --> 00:34:41,109
No. Not really.
I saw them come through here earlier.

308
00:34:41,234 --> 00:34:42,652
She's headed for Lava Falls.

309
00:34:44,112 --> 00:34:46,656
That's where they care for the newborns.

310
00:34:46,782 --> 00:34:50,994
To get there, you've got to go
through the Jungle of Misery,

311
00:34:51,119 --> 00:34:53,622
across the Chasm of Death

312
00:34:55,707 --> 00:34:58,168
to the Plates of Woe.

313
00:35:01,088 --> 00:35:05,132
Okay! Good luck with the slow
descent into madness.

314
00:35:05,257 --> 00:35:06,342
We're gonna go now.

315
00:35:10,137 --> 00:35:12,932
What, you think this is
some sort of tropical getaway?

316
00:35:13,557 --> 00:35:16,185
You can't protect your mate, mate.

317
00:35:16,769 --> 00:35:19,855
What are you gonna do
with those flimsy tusks

318
00:35:19,980 --> 00:35:22,358
when you run into the beast?

319
00:35:23,943 --> 00:35:25,486
I call him

320
00:35:25,986 --> 00:35:27,530
Rudy.

321
00:35:27,655 --> 00:35:31,367
Oh, good. Good. I was worried
it was something intimidating,

322
00:35:31,492 --> 00:35:34,203
like "Sheldon" or "Tim."

323
00:35:34,620 --> 00:35:38,124
Wait. You mean there's something
bigger than Mommy Dinosaur?

324
00:35:38,249 --> 00:35:39,625
- Aye.
- Eye?

325
00:35:40,042 --> 00:35:43,129
Aye, aye! He's the one that gave me this!

326
00:35:44,713 --> 00:35:48,801
- He gave you that patch?
- For free? That's so cool.

327
00:35:48,926 --> 00:35:51,387
Yeah. Maybe he'll give us one, too.

328
00:35:55,683 --> 00:35:57,435
Welcome to my world.

329
00:36:01,063 --> 00:36:03,941
Abandon all hope, he who enters there!

330
00:36:04,066 --> 00:36:06,026
All right! We get it!

331
00:36:06,152 --> 00:36:09,113
Doom and despair, yada, yada, yada.

332
00:37:22,811 --> 00:37:25,397
Sounds like a jungle of misery to me.

333
00:37:39,202 --> 00:37:42,622
- Hold on.
- Why? What's wrong? Peaches?

334
00:37:42,747 --> 00:37:47,001
What? No! It's just I got a funny feeling.

335
00:37:47,335 --> 00:37:50,672
You're hungry! Low blood sugar.
There's some fruit!

336
00:37:51,381 --> 00:37:54,342
- No! Manny!
- I wouldn't do that if I were you.

337
00:37:55,009 --> 00:37:57,637
This isn't exactly your playground.

338
00:37:58,513 --> 00:38:01,099
Like I'm really gonna be afraid
of a pretty flower.

339
00:38:03,685 --> 00:38:05,395
Bet you didn't see that coming.

340
00:38:06,896 --> 00:38:09,858
- Manny!
- For the record, I blame you for this.

341
00:38:12,318 --> 00:38:14,654
Stop eating our friends, plant!

342
00:38:20,368 --> 00:38:22,704
That's it! I'm tearing it up from the roots!

343
00:38:22,829 --> 00:38:26,541
- Do that, and it will clamp shut forever.
- What?

344
00:38:26,666 --> 00:38:29,210
All right, preggers,
don't get your trunk in a knot.

345
00:38:29,335 --> 00:38:31,004
I'll have them out of there
before they're digested.

346
00:38:31,129 --> 00:38:32,380
Digested?

347
00:38:33,047 --> 00:38:34,883
They'll be nothing but bones
in three minutes.

348
00:38:35,008 --> 00:38:36,426
Well, maybe five for the fat one.

349
00:38:36,551 --> 00:38:38,178
I'm not fat!

350
00:38:39,762 --> 00:38:41,055
I feel tingly.

351
00:38:41,180 --> 00:38:43,223
Don't say that
when you're pressed up against me.

352
00:38:43,348 --> 00:38:45,267
Not that kind of tingly.

353
00:38:45,559 --> 00:38:47,394
I can feel it, too.

354
00:38:49,271 --> 00:38:51,190
Help! Someone help us!

355
00:38:51,482 --> 00:38:52,524
Hurry!

356
00:38:52,649 --> 00:38:54,401
It's time to get

357
00:38:54,735 --> 00:38:56,236
Buck Wild.

358
00:39:05,579 --> 00:39:07,206
Who's fat now?

359
00:39:30,896 --> 00:39:32,147
No!

360
00:40:12,855 --> 00:40:14,022
Tourists.

361
00:40:14,148 --> 00:40:16,150
Barfed on by a plant.

362
00:40:16,525 --> 00:40:17,818
- Awesome!
- Awesome!

363
00:40:18,527 --> 00:40:20,154
Say something.

364
00:40:21,697 --> 00:40:23,657
Thanks for saving us.

365
00:40:24,074 --> 00:40:26,994
Buck, will you help us find
the floppy green thing?

366
00:40:27,119 --> 00:40:29,704
- That's not necessary!
- Yes, it is.

367
00:40:32,039 --> 00:40:34,000
All right, I'll help you.

368
00:40:34,125 --> 00:40:35,585
But I got rules.

369
00:40:35,710 --> 00:40:38,963
Rule number one, always listen to Buck.

370
00:40:40,214 --> 00:40:43,468
Rule number two,
stay in the middle of the trail.

371
00:40:44,052 --> 00:40:45,678
Rule number three,

372
00:40:49,891 --> 00:40:52,977
he who has gas
travels at the back of the pack.

373
00:40:56,189 --> 00:40:58,357
Come on, then. Chop, chop!

374
00:40:58,775 --> 00:41:00,985
We should all have our heads examined.

375
00:41:01,110 --> 00:41:04,697
That's rule number four!
Now let's go find your friend!

376
00:41:26,177 --> 00:41:30,056
It's okay. It's okay. Don't worry.
We're gonna be fine.

377
00:41:30,181 --> 00:41:32,934
Please stop swaying. A little nauseous.

378
00:41:38,147 --> 00:41:41,192
See? She's putting us down...

379
00:41:43,778 --> 00:41:47,615
No! I'm too young to be eaten!

380
00:41:50,910 --> 00:41:54,122
Nice mucus.
And I don't say that to everyone.

381
00:42:07,802 --> 00:42:11,431
Listen, families get complicated!
Maybe we can work something out.

382
00:42:11,556 --> 00:42:13,641
I can take them Sunday to Tuesday!

383
00:42:13,766 --> 00:42:16,310
Wednesday to Friday? Weekends?

384
00:42:24,067 --> 00:42:26,820
It's okay! Momma's okay.

385
00:42:29,322 --> 00:42:32,117
If you eat me, it will send a bad message.

386
00:42:37,914 --> 00:42:39,958
Score one for the sloth!

387
00:42:45,255 --> 00:42:47,466
And the score's all tied up.

388
00:42:52,429 --> 00:42:54,473
Do you think the beast will find Sid?

389
00:42:54,598 --> 00:42:57,142
Or more importantly, us?

390
00:42:57,267 --> 00:42:59,186
Rudy? Are you joking?

391
00:42:59,603 --> 00:43:04,232
He's relentless.
He knows all, sees all, eats all.

392
00:43:05,692 --> 00:43:07,319
So that's a yes.

393
00:43:11,823 --> 00:43:14,785
Hey! Get off my lawn! Go on! Shoo!

394
00:43:20,373 --> 00:43:21,917
I knew that guy when he was a caterpillar.

395
00:43:22,042 --> 00:43:24,086
You know, before he came out.

396
00:43:26,296 --> 00:43:28,423
So you're just living down here
by your wits,

397
00:43:28,548 --> 00:43:31,009
all on your own, no responsibilities.

398
00:43:31,134 --> 00:43:34,721
Not a one. It's incredible.
No dependents, no limits.

399
00:43:35,389 --> 00:43:37,849
It's the greatest life
a single guy could have.

400
00:43:37,974 --> 00:43:40,769
Hear that? This is my kind of place.

401
00:43:40,894 --> 00:43:42,020
Hello?

402
00:43:42,145 --> 00:43:43,855
Yeah... No, look, I can't talk right now.

403
00:43:43,980 --> 00:43:46,149
Yeah. No, I'm trying to recover
a dead sloth.

404
00:43:46,274 --> 00:43:47,317
Yeah.

405
00:43:49,486 --> 00:43:51,029
No, they're following me!

406
00:43:51,154 --> 00:43:53,365
I know! They think I'm crazy.

407
00:43:53,949 --> 00:43:56,201
No... Okay, we're going
into the Chasm of Death.

408
00:43:56,326 --> 00:43:58,120
I'm... I'm going to lose you.

409
00:43:58,245 --> 00:43:59,413
Yeah, I love you, too.

410
00:43:59,538 --> 00:44:01,998
All right, good-bye. Good-bye! Good-bye.

411
00:44:02,124 --> 00:44:03,708
Okay! Follow me.

412
00:44:04,251 --> 00:44:06,335
That's you in three weeks.

413
00:44:24,437 --> 00:44:27,314
So, why do they call it
the Chasm of Death?

414
00:44:27,732 --> 00:44:32,069
Well, we tried "Big Smelly Crack,"
but that just made everybody giggle.

415
00:44:32,737 --> 00:44:34,363
Well, now what?

416
00:44:37,491 --> 00:44:38,743
Madame.

417
00:44:39,952 --> 00:44:41,412
She is not doing that!

418
00:44:42,788 --> 00:44:44,540
Rule number one.

419
00:44:48,043 --> 00:44:51,338
Come on, mammoth!
You're supposed to have a good memory.

420
00:44:51,464 --> 00:44:53,424
Always listen to Buck.

421
00:44:58,137 --> 00:45:01,932
Now, eyes forward, back straight, and...

422
00:45:02,058 --> 00:45:04,602
Oh, yes, breathe in the toxic fumes
and you'll probably die.

423
00:45:04,727 --> 00:45:05,811
Toxic fumes?

424
00:45:05,936 --> 00:45:09,440
- Just another day in paradise.
- Wait!

425
00:45:10,608 --> 00:45:12,610
Geronimo!

426
00:45:22,828 --> 00:45:25,998
- Ellie, you okay?
- You have to try this!

427
00:45:26,123 --> 00:45:29,752
All right, now pile on, everyone!
Couldn't be easier!

428
00:45:34,673 --> 00:45:36,092
Don't panic!

429
00:45:36,217 --> 00:45:38,761
Just some technical difficulties.

430
00:45:39,512 --> 00:45:41,514
Keep holding it in, boys!

431
00:45:45,017 --> 00:45:46,685
I can't take it anymore!

432
00:45:46,811 --> 00:45:48,437
He breathed it!

433
00:45:48,562 --> 00:45:50,481
And now I'm breathing it!

434
00:45:53,526 --> 00:45:55,652
Hey! We're not dead!

435
00:45:55,777 --> 00:45:57,278
You sound ridiculous!

436
00:45:57,404 --> 00:45:59,572
Me? You should hear you!

437
00:46:03,618 --> 00:46:06,496
All right, all right. And a one, and a two...

438
00:46:06,621 --> 00:46:09,165
Christmas, Christmas time is here

439
00:46:09,290 --> 00:46:11,334
Stop! Are you crazy?

440
00:46:13,712 --> 00:46:14,838
It's not poison.

441
00:46:21,553 --> 00:46:23,555
That is so disturbing!

442
00:46:25,974 --> 00:46:28,184
Stop laughing! All of you!

443
00:46:28,727 --> 00:46:31,020
"Stop laughing, all of you!"

444
00:46:33,565 --> 00:46:35,775
"What's rule number one?"

445
00:46:39,237 --> 00:46:41,531
They're just laughing.
What's so bad about that?

446
00:46:41,656 --> 00:46:43,575
They died laughing!

447
00:46:46,995 --> 00:46:48,455
Stop laughing!

448
00:46:48,913 --> 00:46:50,749
You know what's funny, though?

449
00:46:50,874 --> 00:46:53,209
We're trying to save Sid,

450
00:46:53,334 --> 00:46:55,462
and now we're all gonna die!

451
00:46:57,130 --> 00:47:00,800
- And I don't even like Sid!
- Who does? He's an idiot!

452
00:47:03,595 --> 00:47:07,390
Thanks for getting me into this mess.
It's the most fun I've had in years!

453
00:47:07,515 --> 00:47:11,644
Thank you for deserting the herd!
That was totally super!

454
00:47:18,818 --> 00:47:20,361
Stop that!

455
00:47:20,779 --> 00:47:23,490
Don't you see? We're all gonna die!

456
00:47:29,120 --> 00:47:31,247
We gotta do everything, huh?

457
00:47:38,296 --> 00:47:40,548
Sometimes I wet my bed!

458
00:47:40,673 --> 00:47:43,592
That's all right!
Sometimes I wet your bed!

459
00:47:56,146 --> 00:47:58,607
I'm not sure how much of that
you could hear.

460
00:47:58,732 --> 00:48:01,735
- I heard all of it.
- Right. Yeah.

461
00:48:02,236 --> 00:48:05,197
- You wet my bed?
- That was gas talk, dude.

462
00:48:05,948 --> 00:48:08,575
Well, better get moving.

463
00:48:08,700 --> 00:48:10,577
Aren't we forgetting something?

464
00:48:10,702 --> 00:48:12,955
Here, Rudy, Rudy, Rudy!

465
00:48:14,373 --> 00:48:16,041
I'm so lonely.

466
00:48:34,268 --> 00:48:36,353
Okay. Here you go, guys.

467
00:48:44,653 --> 00:48:46,655
What? You're not gonna
eat your vegetables?

468
00:48:46,780 --> 00:48:50,576
How are you gonna become
big, strong dinosaurs?

469
00:48:55,038 --> 00:48:59,793
No. I've raised them vegetarian.
It's a healthier lifestyle.

470
00:48:59,918 --> 00:49:03,422
I mean, look at me.
I have the pelt of a much younger sloth.

471
00:49:04,548 --> 00:49:08,177
Excuse me!
I'm trying to have a conversation here.

472
00:49:14,683 --> 00:49:17,061
No, no, no. That's not for us, kids.

473
00:49:17,186 --> 00:49:19,938
It's way too feathery and fleshy and...

474
00:49:20,856 --> 00:49:22,316
And alive!

475
00:49:29,740 --> 00:49:34,452
No! No, no, we do not eat
live animals, period!

476
00:49:35,286 --> 00:49:37,205
Now, go! Fly!

477
00:49:37,330 --> 00:49:38,915
Be free,

478
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:43,294
little flightless bird.

479
00:49:45,963 --> 00:49:47,215
My bad.

480
00:49:48,091 --> 00:49:50,176
Hey, where are you going?

481
00:49:50,301 --> 00:49:52,470
This is how you resolve conflict?

482
00:49:52,595 --> 00:49:54,597
No wonder you're single!

483
00:49:58,976 --> 00:50:01,229
Come on. Am I talking to myself here?

484
00:50:01,354 --> 00:50:03,898
I say, "They're vegetarian."
You say, "Grrr."

485
00:50:04,023 --> 00:50:06,484
I say, "Can we talk about talk this?"
You say, "Grrr."

486
00:50:06,609 --> 00:50:08,820
I don't call that communication.

487
00:50:08,945 --> 00:50:11,656
See? That's your answer to everything.

488
00:50:24,502 --> 00:50:27,463
What are you afraid of?
You're the biggest thing on Earth!

489
00:50:31,843 --> 00:50:33,302
Aren't you?

490
00:50:36,764 --> 00:50:37,849
Hey!

491
00:50:46,315 --> 00:50:49,152
They'll never survive.
It's dangerous by day.

492
00:50:49,277 --> 00:50:51,028
But it's even worse at night.

493
00:50:51,154 --> 00:50:53,364
Plus, their guide is a lunatic.

494
00:50:53,489 --> 00:50:55,783
What? You mean, Buck? He's wacko!

495
00:50:55,908 --> 00:50:56,951
I am not!

496
00:50:57,076 --> 00:50:58,119
Totally bonkers.

497
00:50:58,244 --> 00:50:59,370
And his feet smell.

498
00:50:59,495 --> 00:51:00,788
Shut up! You shut up.

499
00:51:00,913 --> 00:51:02,582
Oh, you little...

500
00:51:02,707 --> 00:51:03,916
Gotcha!

501
00:51:04,208 --> 00:51:06,085
He's strangling his own foot.

502
00:51:06,210 --> 00:51:08,504
- Shouldn't we get moving?
- What?

503
00:51:08,713 --> 00:51:11,466
And give Rudy a midnight snack?
Not likely!

504
00:51:11,591 --> 00:51:13,509
The skull's right.
Take a load off, mammals.

505
00:51:13,634 --> 00:51:15,011
We'll camp here.

506
00:51:15,136 --> 00:51:16,596
Now, who's hungry?

507
00:51:16,721 --> 00:51:17,722
I am!

508
00:51:17,847 --> 00:51:20,058
You don't need the calories!

509
00:51:24,728 --> 00:51:29,441
There I was, my back against the wall,
no way out,

510
00:51:30,776 --> 00:51:33,820
perched on the razor's edge of oblivion,

511
00:51:34,196 --> 00:51:38,533
staring into the eye
of the Great White Beast.

512
00:52:40,429 --> 00:52:43,306
- Were you killed?
- Sadly, yes.

513
00:52:43,432 --> 00:52:44,558
But I lived!

514
00:52:47,769 --> 00:52:52,065
Never had I felt so alive
than when I was so close to death.

515
00:52:53,108 --> 00:52:55,402
Just before Rudy could suck me
down his gullet,

516
00:52:55,527 --> 00:52:57,612
I grabbed hold of that gross,
pink, fleshy thing

517
00:52:57,738 --> 00:52:59,531
that dangles at the back of the throat.

518
00:53:00,657 --> 00:53:04,077
I hung onto that sucker, and I swung
back and forth,

519
00:53:04,244 --> 00:53:09,082
and back and forth, and back and forth,
and back and forth, and back

520
00:53:10,249 --> 00:53:12,168
and forth, and back and forth,

521
00:53:12,293 --> 00:53:15,921
until finally, I let go
and I shot right out of his mouth!

522
00:53:17,631 --> 00:53:21,302
I may have lost an eye that day,
but I got this!

523
00:53:22,344 --> 00:53:24,513
- Rudy's tooth!
- Dang!

524
00:53:25,181 --> 00:53:27,475
It's like the old saying, "An eye for a tooth,

525
00:53:27,600 --> 00:53:30,770
"a nose for a chin, a butt for a..."

526
00:53:31,854 --> 00:53:34,732
Well, it's an old saying,
but it's not a very good one.

527
00:53:34,857 --> 00:53:37,985
- You are Super Weasel!
- Ultra-Weasel!

528
00:53:38,110 --> 00:53:39,653
Diesel Weasel!

529
00:53:44,492 --> 00:53:45,993
What? He is.

530
00:53:46,327 --> 00:53:49,246
Now let me tell you about the time
I used a sharpened clam shell

531
00:53:49,372 --> 00:53:51,791
to turn a T-Rex into a T-Rachel.

532
00:53:52,208 --> 00:53:53,626
- Yes, master.
- Yes, master.

533
00:53:54,502 --> 00:53:56,796
That's enough fairy tales for one night.

534
00:53:56,921 --> 00:53:59,465
Come on, Ellie, you should rest now.

535
00:54:00,424 --> 00:54:01,592
Life of the party.

536
00:54:01,717 --> 00:54:04,428
All right, you guys get some shut-eye.
I'll keep watch.

537
00:54:04,553 --> 00:54:08,933
Don't worry, Buck. We got this.
Night time is possum time.

538
00:54:09,058 --> 00:54:11,352
Yeah! We own the night, baby.

539
00:54:25,908 --> 00:54:27,576
Good night, Rudy.

540
00:54:39,964 --> 00:54:42,091
Wait, wait. What about me?

541
00:54:57,231 --> 00:55:00,316
Sleep well, kids!
We have a busy day tomorrow.

542
00:55:00,775 --> 00:55:02,777
Foraging, hunting,

543
00:55:04,904 --> 00:55:06,823
missing my friends,

544
00:55:07,365 --> 00:55:09,868
who probably aren't missing me.

545
00:55:24,090 --> 00:55:26,176
You're a real softie, you know that?

546
00:55:50,033 --> 00:55:51,159
Manny?

547
00:55:55,914 --> 00:55:58,666
Crash? Eddie?

548
00:56:02,712 --> 00:56:04,005
Manny?

549
00:56:22,816 --> 00:56:25,318
What's going on? Are you okay?

550
00:56:26,820 --> 00:56:29,364
I'm sorry. I just wanted to keep you safe,

551
00:56:29,489 --> 00:56:32,826
and now you're in the most dangerous
place in the world.

552
00:56:32,951 --> 00:56:35,245
Hey. This isn't your fault.

553
00:56:35,370 --> 00:56:38,707
It's bigger than both of us.
We have to get Sid.

554
00:56:39,332 --> 00:56:42,377
Yeah, but if I had been
a better friend to him,

555
00:56:42,836 --> 00:56:45,296
- we wouldn't be here.
- Better friend?

556
00:56:45,547 --> 00:56:47,716
Are you plucking my whiskers?

557
00:56:47,841 --> 00:56:52,052
You risked your life, your mate
and your baby to save your buddy.

558
00:56:53,345 --> 00:56:56,807
Not the best husband or father,
but a darn good friend!

559
00:57:04,398 --> 00:57:05,524
Hey!

560
00:58:16,095 --> 00:58:17,721
Everybody, stop!

561
00:58:19,473 --> 00:58:21,183
I smell something.

562
00:58:26,355 --> 00:58:29,191
It smells like a buzzard's butt fell off

563
00:58:29,942 --> 00:58:32,569
and then got sprayed on
by a bunch of skunks.

564
00:58:32,694 --> 00:58:33,821
That's Sid.

565
00:58:33,946 --> 00:58:37,240
Mammals, we have ourselves
a crime scene.

566
00:58:37,824 --> 00:58:40,993
A tuft of fur. Half-eaten carcass!

567
00:58:41,661 --> 00:58:44,038
Hunk of... No!

568
00:58:44,497 --> 00:58:45,790
Broccoli.

569
00:58:46,749 --> 00:58:47,917
Here's what I think happened.

570
00:58:48,418 --> 00:58:49,544
Dinosaur attacks Sid,

571
00:58:49,669 --> 00:58:53,464
Sid fights back with piece of broccoli,
leaving dinosaur

572
00:58:54,799 --> 00:58:55,925
a vegetable.

573
00:58:56,050 --> 00:58:59,178
Are you nuts? Sid's not violent.
Or coordinated.

574
00:58:59,554 --> 00:59:01,597
Yeah. And where's the dinosaur?

575
00:59:01,723 --> 00:59:04,058
All right. All right, good point.

576
00:59:04,183 --> 00:59:05,393
Theory two.

577
00:59:05,518 --> 00:59:06,728
Sid's eating broccoli,

578
00:59:06,853 --> 00:59:08,146
dinosaur eats Sid,

579
00:59:08,271 --> 00:59:11,023
dinosaur steps on broccoli,
leaving broccoli

580
00:59:11,774 --> 00:59:13,025
a vegetable.

581
00:59:13,151 --> 00:59:15,403
Buck, when exactly
did you lose your mind?

582
00:59:16,279 --> 00:59:17,280
Three months ago.

583
00:59:17,405 --> 00:59:20,074
I woke up one morning
married to a pineapple.

584
00:59:20,199 --> 00:59:21,409
An ugly pineapple.

585
00:59:23,411 --> 00:59:24,746
But I loved her.

586
00:59:24,871 --> 00:59:28,082
Buck, I think you missed
a little clue over here.

587
00:59:29,459 --> 00:59:33,129
Well, your friend might be alive,
but not for long.

588
00:59:34,756 --> 00:59:36,424
Rudy's closing in.

589
00:59:37,467 --> 00:59:38,509
- Whoa!
- Whoa!

590
00:59:38,634 --> 00:59:42,096
You got it. The Plates of Woe.

591
00:59:42,555 --> 00:59:44,265
Or whatever's left of them.

592
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:57,129
Single file, everyone! Head for Lava Falls.

593
01:01:10,767 --> 01:01:14,896
- What's that sound?
- It's the wind. It's speaking to us.

594
01:01:15,522 --> 01:01:17,691
- What's it saying?
- I don't know.

595
01:01:17,816 --> 01:01:19,276
I don't speak Wind.

596
01:01:28,326 --> 01:01:31,663
- Ellie!
- I'm fine. Don't worry about me.

597
01:01:31,788 --> 01:01:33,373
I'm just taking my...

598
01:01:36,293 --> 01:01:37,419
Ellie!

599
01:01:40,130 --> 01:01:42,215
- Manny!
- Get to the ledge!

600
01:01:59,149 --> 01:02:00,358
Ellie!

601
01:02:01,818 --> 01:02:03,612
Ellie! Where are you?

602
01:02:03,945 --> 01:02:06,323
It's okay! I'm up here!

603
01:02:06,698 --> 01:02:09,451
Hang on, Ellie! We'll be right there!

604
01:02:31,806 --> 01:02:34,016
Wait! Sloth down!

605
01:02:36,268 --> 01:02:38,854
Wait. Wait. Time out!

606
01:02:39,772 --> 01:02:43,651
Hold up. You guys are getting fast!

607
01:02:48,072 --> 01:02:51,951
It's not so bad down here.
Nice weather, friendly neighbors.

608
01:02:59,166 --> 01:03:00,668
Hi, neighbor.

609
01:03:04,004 --> 01:03:05,756
- Rudy.
- Rudy?

610
01:03:07,675 --> 01:03:10,302
- Never heard that kind of dino before.
- That's Sid!

611
01:03:10,761 --> 01:03:14,140
- We'll have to move fast.
- Manny! Pineapples!

612
01:03:14,682 --> 01:03:16,809
- Pineapples?
- She gets cravings.

613
01:03:16,934 --> 01:03:20,146
Pomegranates? Grapefruits! Nectarines?

614
01:03:20,271 --> 01:03:22,022
She's ordering a fruit cocktail.

615
01:03:22,189 --> 01:03:23,816
Come on, think!

616
01:03:24,775 --> 01:03:26,110
Peaches!

617
01:03:26,986 --> 01:03:28,279
Peaches?

618
01:03:28,946 --> 01:03:31,866
Peaches! The baby! What, now?

619
01:03:31,991 --> 01:03:33,784
This? Not good.

620
01:03:33,909 --> 01:03:35,286
The baby's coming!
Did you guys hear that?

621
01:03:35,411 --> 01:03:36,954
'Cause sometimes
I imagine it in my head, but...

622
01:03:37,079 --> 01:03:38,748
Can you try to hold it in?

623
01:03:38,873 --> 01:03:40,916
Can somebody slap him for me?

624
01:03:41,876 --> 01:03:43,335
Done and done.

625
01:03:43,711 --> 01:03:45,337
Just sit tight. We're coming!

626
01:03:45,463 --> 01:03:47,965
There's only one thing to do.
Possums, you're with me.

627
01:03:48,090 --> 01:03:50,384
Manny, you take care of Ellie
until we get back.

628
01:03:50,509 --> 01:03:52,136
What? No, you can't leave now!

629
01:03:52,261 --> 01:03:54,597
She's off the trail!
What about rule number two?

630
01:03:54,722 --> 01:03:57,266
Rule number five says
you can ignore rule number two

631
01:03:57,391 --> 01:04:00,603
if there's a female involved,
or possibly a cute dog.

632
01:04:00,728 --> 01:04:02,646
You know I just make up these rules
as I go along.

633
01:04:02,772 --> 01:04:06,649
- Yeah, but, but she's... You have to...
- Manny, it's all right.

634
01:04:07,317 --> 01:04:08,985
I got your back.

635
01:04:10,695 --> 01:04:13,365
Now you're talking! Come on, lads.

636
01:04:15,992 --> 01:04:19,954
- Take care of our sister, mister.
- No pressure.

637
01:04:20,663 --> 01:04:22,332
What does that mean, "I got your back"?

638
01:04:22,457 --> 01:04:23,875
I mean, I'd rather they covered the front.

639
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:25,543
That's where all the good stuff is, isn't it?

640
01:04:25,668 --> 01:04:27,337
We gotta move.

641
01:04:32,008 --> 01:04:34,302
Okay. All right. It's okay.

642
01:04:35,178 --> 01:04:37,305
Daddy's... Daddy's coming.

643
01:04:37,931 --> 01:04:40,975
I gotta say, sweetheart,
you really got timing.

644
01:05:01,371 --> 01:05:05,709
Go away! Go away!
Stranger danger! Stranger danger!

645
01:05:18,388 --> 01:05:20,974
Don't worry. It's just lava.

646
01:05:22,142 --> 01:05:24,769
Deadly boiling lava!

647
01:05:40,493 --> 01:05:43,621
- Boys, are you ready for adventure?
- Yes, sir!

648
01:05:43,747 --> 01:05:45,623
- For danger?
- Yes, sir!

649
01:05:45,749 --> 01:05:47,125
For death?

650
01:05:47,834 --> 01:05:49,085
Can you repeat the question?

651
01:05:49,210 --> 01:05:50,462
Jump!

652
01:06:01,305 --> 01:06:01,889
That's right! Come on!

653
01:06:01,889 --> 01:06:03,307
That's right! Come on!

654
01:06:06,060 --> 01:06:07,811
Have you ever flown one of these before?

655
01:06:07,936 --> 01:06:10,022
No! First time, actually.

656
01:06:18,238 --> 01:06:20,324
- There she is!
- Ellie!

657
01:06:20,449 --> 01:06:21,658
Manny!

658
01:06:26,330 --> 01:06:27,664
I need to get to her!

659
01:06:27,790 --> 01:06:29,666
Listen. I'll protect Ellie.

660
01:06:29,792 --> 01:06:31,335
- You stop those guys.
- But...

661
01:06:31,460 --> 01:06:35,714
Manny, if they reach her, it'll be too late.
You have to trust me.

662
01:06:39,385 --> 01:06:41,345
All right. Let's do it.

663
01:07:17,840 --> 01:07:20,426
My paws are burning, baby!
They're burning!

664
01:07:20,551 --> 01:07:22,553
I got to tip-toe.
Tippy-toe. Tippy-toe.

665
01:07:22,678 --> 01:07:25,848
Excuse me, twinkle toes!
Giving birth here.

666
01:07:26,306 --> 01:07:29,226
Right. Sorry. You okay?

667
01:07:29,476 --> 01:07:32,730
Am I okay?
Do you know anything about childbirth?

668
01:07:32,855 --> 01:07:35,190
No, not really, but Manny's coming.

669
01:07:42,780 --> 01:07:45,992
Diego, I'm scared. Can I hold your paw?

670
01:07:46,117 --> 01:07:48,077
Yeah, of course.

671
01:07:48,202 --> 01:07:50,038
Just go with the pain.

672
01:07:51,289 --> 01:07:53,541
- It's just a contraction.
- No!

673
01:08:06,387 --> 01:08:08,264
Look! He's right there!

674
01:08:08,389 --> 01:08:10,391
- Roger!
- No! Sid!

675
01:08:10,516 --> 01:08:12,018
I know! Roger!

676
01:08:12,143 --> 01:08:14,979
How about we get Sid first
and then go back for Roger?

677
01:08:15,730 --> 01:08:16,856
Never mind!

678
01:08:28,993 --> 01:08:30,286
Buck?

679
01:08:46,094 --> 01:08:49,722
No, no, Buck! Buck, wait! Sid's that way!

680
01:08:49,847 --> 01:08:51,641
Tell that to them!

681
01:08:53,434 --> 01:08:56,187
Bring it on, you chicken-headed freaks!

682
01:09:13,955 --> 01:09:16,916
Don't worry about a thing.
You're doing fine.

683
01:09:18,376 --> 01:09:20,044
It's going great.

684
01:09:20,878 --> 01:09:22,171
Excuse me.

685
01:09:25,258 --> 01:09:27,009
Just keep breathing!

686
01:09:27,343 --> 01:09:28,428
Diego!

687
01:09:28,553 --> 01:09:31,346
Just breathe! That's the important thing.

688
01:09:39,438 --> 01:09:41,064
Grab that ammo!

689
01:09:44,985 --> 01:09:46,945
Bogey, three o'clock! Fire!

690
01:09:55,662 --> 01:09:58,707
This is awesome!

691
01:10:02,085 --> 01:10:03,545
Light it up!

692
01:10:04,755 --> 01:10:06,882
- Yeah!
- Hasta la vista, birdy!

693
01:10:19,353 --> 01:10:21,146
Let's get our sloth!

694
01:10:21,271 --> 01:10:24,399
We're hit! We're hit! Mayday! Mayday!

695
01:10:24,524 --> 01:10:28,111
We're losing altitude! Hold these!

696
01:10:31,239 --> 01:10:32,824
Tastes like fish.

697
01:10:32,949 --> 01:10:35,077
Okay. That's just weird.

698
01:10:36,745 --> 01:10:39,664
- I love you, bro!
- I know!

699
01:10:40,374 --> 01:10:42,376
Snap out of it! Come on!

700
01:10:43,251 --> 01:10:44,461
Pull!

701
01:10:53,261 --> 01:10:56,890
This is the end of Sid the Sloth!

702
01:11:04,439 --> 01:11:06,692
- Help!
- No, Sid! It's me!

703
01:11:06,817 --> 01:11:08,568
- And me!
- And me!

704
01:11:08,694 --> 01:11:11,738
I don't want to panic anybody,
but who's flying this thing?

705
01:11:11,863 --> 01:11:12,864
Oops!

706
01:11:25,793 --> 01:11:27,878
No, no, wait! Wait! My kids!

707
01:11:31,298 --> 01:11:33,759
I never even got to say good-bye.

708
01:11:37,179 --> 01:11:39,890
You can do it! Push! Push!

709
01:11:40,015 --> 01:11:41,559
I can't do it!

710
01:11:41,684 --> 01:11:43,519
Just one more big push!

711
01:11:43,644 --> 01:11:46,439
You have no idea what I'm going through!

712
01:11:46,981 --> 01:11:50,109
Okay, forget I said that.
Let's do this together.

713
01:12:00,327 --> 01:12:02,830
I liked you guys better
when you were extinct.

714
01:12:08,210 --> 01:12:09,462
Getting dizzy.

715
01:12:11,255 --> 01:12:15,134
Manny! Come on, buddy.
I think we're getting close.

716
01:12:50,378 --> 01:12:52,004
She's perfect.

717
01:12:53,047 --> 01:12:55,800
I think we should call her Ellie.

718
01:12:57,718 --> 01:12:59,053
Little Ellie.

719
01:12:59,178 --> 01:13:01,430
I got a better name. Peaches.

720
01:13:02,390 --> 01:13:03,724
Peaches?

721
01:13:03,849 --> 01:13:08,812
Why not? She's sweet and round
and covered with fuzz.

722
01:13:09,521 --> 01:13:10,814
Peaches.

723
01:13:11,690 --> 01:13:12,982
I love it.

724
01:13:16,528 --> 01:13:17,946
I saw that, tough guy.

725
01:13:18,071 --> 01:13:21,282
No, no. That last dino
caught my eye with a claw, and...

726
01:13:22,033 --> 01:13:23,785
All right, so I'm not made of stone.

727
01:13:23,910 --> 01:13:25,495
Incoming!

728
01:13:27,372 --> 01:13:28,707
It's Sid!

729
01:13:33,670 --> 01:13:36,047
- It's a boy!
- That's its tail.

730
01:13:36,172 --> 01:13:37,549
It's a girl!

731
01:13:38,550 --> 01:13:43,054
Hi, sweetheart. Hello, hello!
It's Uncle Sid. Yes, it is.

732
01:13:43,179 --> 01:13:47,392
You're so beautiful. She is!
She looks just like her mother.

733
01:13:48,101 --> 01:13:49,602
Thank goodness.

734
01:13:50,020 --> 01:13:53,606
No offense, Manny! No offense.
You're beautiful on the inside!

735
01:13:53,732 --> 01:13:55,442
It's good to have you back, Sid.

736
01:13:55,567 --> 01:13:59,195
Never thought I would say this,
but I missed you, buddy.

737
01:14:03,616 --> 01:14:05,910
Now I wish my kids were here.

738
01:14:06,286 --> 01:14:08,455
You could have been friends.

739
01:14:09,664 --> 01:14:10,790
Ellie!

740
01:14:14,627 --> 01:14:17,005
I promised myself I wouldn't cry.

741
01:14:17,130 --> 01:14:18,339
I didn't.

742
01:14:23,928 --> 01:14:26,806
I forgot what it was like
to be part of a family.

743
01:14:26,931 --> 01:14:29,476
What about you?
Ever thought about having kids?

744
01:14:33,271 --> 01:14:36,149
All right, mammals, let's get you home.

745
01:16:03,235 --> 01:16:06,739
This is it, mammals.
Right where you started.

746
01:16:06,864 --> 01:16:10,117
This was fun!
We could make it a regular thing.

747
01:16:11,243 --> 01:16:12,745
I don't know about that.

748
01:16:12,870 --> 01:16:17,207
Right! Right. Yes, because of
all the mortal peril, of course.

749
01:16:18,459 --> 01:16:20,502
Well, the Buck stops here.

750
01:16:21,712 --> 01:16:23,589
We couldn't have done it without you.

751
01:16:23,714 --> 01:16:26,717
Well, obviously. But good times, just the...

752
01:16:28,343 --> 01:16:30,387
We're not alone, are we?

753
01:16:34,725 --> 01:16:36,060
Hello, Rudy.

754
01:16:45,194 --> 01:16:46,402
Run!

755
01:16:53,493 --> 01:16:55,953
Over here, you colossal fossil!

756
01:16:56,454 --> 01:16:58,414
Looking for something?

757
01:17:00,083 --> 01:17:01,793
Why don't you come and get it!

758
01:17:01,918 --> 01:17:03,628
To the cave! Go!

759
01:17:07,048 --> 01:17:09,842
- Stay with the baby.
- We'll be fine. Go.

760
01:17:17,475 --> 01:17:18,685
Wuss.

761
01:17:31,239 --> 01:17:33,032
Pop goes the weasel!

762
01:17:45,336 --> 01:17:47,004
Come on! Move!

763
01:17:49,590 --> 01:17:52,635
- Diego! Catch!
- Got it!

764
01:18:02,687 --> 01:18:05,231
Through the hole, over the valley.
One more loop...

765
01:18:05,940 --> 01:18:07,817
Come on, lads! Heave!

766
01:18:22,874 --> 01:18:24,834
Better luck next time, snowflake.

767
01:18:24,959 --> 01:18:27,086
This isn't going to hold him long! Let's go!

768
01:18:27,211 --> 01:18:28,838
Hold up, guys!

769
01:18:51,401 --> 01:18:53,362
Way to go, Momzilla!

770
01:19:25,435 --> 01:19:28,188
Come here, kids.
Well, let me tell you something.

771
01:19:28,313 --> 01:19:30,232
You're where you belong now.

772
01:19:30,357 --> 01:19:34,444
And I'm sure you're going to grow up
to be giant, horrifying dinosaurs

773
01:19:35,570 --> 01:19:36,905
just like your mother.

774
01:19:39,700 --> 01:19:41,076
And Momma,

775
01:19:42,244 --> 01:19:44,538
take good care of our kids.

776
01:20:12,733 --> 01:20:15,819
- You were a good parent, Sid.
- Thanks.

777
01:20:16,778 --> 01:20:18,655
- Can I baby-sit for you?
- Not a chance.

778
01:20:18,780 --> 01:20:22,075
- Come on. I work cheap!
- All right, I'll think about it.

779
01:20:23,160 --> 01:20:24,368
Yes!

780
01:20:24,493 --> 01:20:25,953
Never happen.

781
01:20:29,874 --> 01:20:33,002
He's gone. What am I supposed to do now?

782
01:20:33,419 --> 01:20:36,047
That's easy. Come with us.

783
01:20:37,465 --> 01:20:39,467
You mean up there?

784
01:20:41,635 --> 01:20:43,512
I never thought of going back.

785
01:20:43,637 --> 01:20:46,849
I've been down here so long,
it feels like up to me.

786
01:20:46,974 --> 01:20:49,060
I'm not sure I can fit in up there anymore.

787
01:20:49,185 --> 01:20:53,147
So? Look at us.
We look like a normal herd to you?

788
01:21:22,510 --> 01:21:24,136
So long, big guy.

789
01:21:35,940 --> 01:21:38,401
That's our cue! Come on, Peaches.

790
01:21:39,944 --> 01:21:41,362
He's alive!

791
01:21:43,030 --> 01:21:44,240
Buck?

792
01:21:45,533 --> 01:21:47,326
I... I got to...

793
01:21:48,619 --> 01:21:49,704
Yeah.

794
01:21:49,954 --> 01:21:53,374
Besides, this world should
really stay down here.

795
01:21:55,292 --> 01:21:57,294
Take care of them, Tiger.

796
01:21:57,545 --> 01:21:59,547
"Always listen to Buck."

797
01:22:00,464 --> 01:22:02,258
We're almost out!

798
01:22:09,098 --> 01:22:10,391
Rudy!

799
01:22:32,287 --> 01:22:33,997
Is everybody okay?

800
01:22:34,539 --> 01:22:36,082
Where's Buck?

801
01:22:38,710 --> 01:22:41,796
Don't worry. He's where he wants to be.

802
01:22:43,131 --> 01:22:45,925
- Is he gonna be okay?
- Are you kidding?

803
01:22:46,051 --> 01:22:49,929
Nothing could kill that weasel.
It's Rudy I'm worried about.

804
01:23:01,274 --> 01:23:04,527
I know this "baby makes three" thing
isn't for you,

805
01:23:04,652 --> 01:23:07,822
but whatever you decide to do...

806
01:23:07,947 --> 01:23:09,699
I'm not leaving, buddy.

807
01:23:09,824 --> 01:23:12,327
Life of adventure? It's right here.

808
01:23:12,744 --> 01:23:16,247
But I got a whole speech here.
I've been working on it.

809
01:23:16,373 --> 01:23:19,793
How can I show you
that I'm strong and sensitive?

810
01:23:19,918 --> 01:23:21,544
Noble yet caring?

811
01:23:23,713 --> 01:23:24,923
Thanks.

812
01:23:39,979 --> 01:23:41,940
They grow so fast, huh?

813
01:23:42,065 --> 01:23:43,692
Yeah. I mean, look at my kids.

814
01:23:43,817 --> 01:23:46,528
Seems like they were born one day
and then gone the next.

815
01:23:46,653 --> 01:23:48,154
They were, Sid.

816
01:23:48,279 --> 01:23:50,615
Yeah. That was a lot of work.

817
01:24:02,501 --> 01:24:06,046
That's right, sweetheart.
Welcome to the Ice Age.

818
01:33:59,843 --> 01:34:00,844
