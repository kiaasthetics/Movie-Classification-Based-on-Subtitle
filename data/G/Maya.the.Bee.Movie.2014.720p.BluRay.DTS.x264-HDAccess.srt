1
00:01:43,355 --> 00:01:44,314
Hmmmm

2
00:01:45,566 --> 00:01:47,651
What a lovely dream.

3
00:01:49,027 --> 00:01:50,028
Hello?

4
00:01:50,779 --> 00:01:52,531
What is this place?

5
00:01:53,949 --> 00:01:56,034
Hey, who's that? Ow!

6
00:02:12,259 --> 00:02:13,135
Hello.

7
00:02:15,095 --> 00:02:17,931
Be patient, little buzzer,
it's still too early.

8
00:02:18,140 --> 00:02:20,392
But I have to tell you
about my dream.

9
00:02:20,601 --> 00:02:23,270
There was this big,
bright round yellow thing.

10
00:02:23,478 --> 00:02:25,147
And all this blue.

11
00:02:25,355 --> 00:02:27,649
- Bees don't dream.
-Why?

12
00:02:27,858 --> 00:02:29,067
Well...

13
00:02:29,901 --> 00:02:31,361
They just don't.

14
00:02:31,570 --> 00:02:34,323
Now rest. Bees never
hatch until the sun rises

15
00:02:34,531 --> 00:02:35,741
over the daffodils.

16
00:02:35,949 --> 00:02:37,618
Why can't I just
do what I want?

17
00:02:37,826 --> 00:02:39,703
A bee do what she wants?

18
00:02:39,911 --> 00:02:41,038
Oh...

19
00:02:43,123 --> 00:02:44,207
Patience, little bee.

20
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:48,545
There's plenty of time
for learning later.

21
00:02:48,754 --> 00:02:51,423
- What's a bee?
-A bee is a good little girl

22
00:02:51,632 --> 00:02:53,133
who does what she's told.

23
00:02:53,342 --> 00:02:55,469
Rock-a-bye bay-bee,

24
00:02:55,677 --> 00:02:57,638
in her wax nest.

25
00:02:57,846 --> 00:03:00,390
When nursie says,

26
00:03:00,599 --> 00:03:02,142
bay-bee will rest.

27
00:03:02,351 --> 00:03:03,852
Good baby,

28
00:03:04,061 --> 00:03:05,646
go to sleep...

29
00:03:05,854 --> 00:03:07,564
That's enough, little one.

30
00:03:07,773 --> 00:03:09,191
Hey!

31
00:03:09,399 --> 00:03:10,651
In you go.

32
00:03:11,943 --> 00:03:15,364
A bee who does what she wants?
Ridiculous!

33
00:03:17,282 --> 00:03:19,701
- What are we making?
-How...?

34
00:03:19,910 --> 00:03:20,994
Now listen here!

35
00:03:21,203 --> 00:03:22,329
We're not going
to tell you again.

36
00:03:22,537 --> 00:03:24,831
Go. Back. In.

37
00:03:28,377 --> 00:03:29,461
There...

38
00:03:29,670 --> 00:03:31,380
Everything is fine.

39
00:03:33,965 --> 00:03:36,760
- What a sweet little bee.
-Sweet?

40
00:03:36,968 --> 00:03:38,512
Now, what was her name?

41
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:41,682
Baby-Bee 396.

42
00:03:41,890 --> 00:03:43,433
396.

43
00:03:44,309 --> 00:03:45,018
Maya.

44
00:03:46,019 --> 00:03:48,146
She's where she belongs now.

45
00:04:02,703 --> 00:04:04,121
Wow!

46
00:04:08,959 --> 00:04:11,378
Hello, busy bees!

47
00:04:15,716 --> 00:04:17,134
What is this?

48
00:04:19,678 --> 00:04:22,597
- This is fun.
-Bees don't have fun.

49
00:04:22,806 --> 00:04:23,765
Get off.

50
00:04:27,144 --> 00:04:29,062
Help! I can't see!

51
00:04:32,232 --> 00:04:34,526
- Excuse me!
-Hey, what?!

52
00:04:37,237 --> 00:04:39,614
I can't see.
I can't see.

53
00:04:39,823 --> 00:04:41,199
I don't want to see!

54
00:04:42,367 --> 00:04:44,828
Listen to that buzz,
Your Majesty.

55
00:04:45,036 --> 00:04:47,497
That's the sound
of good little bees

56
00:04:47,706 --> 00:04:50,250
keeping this
great hive efficient.

57
00:04:55,881 --> 00:04:57,799
This was so fun!
Did you see?

58
00:04:58,008 --> 00:05:01,094
I was all the way up there,
then I was like, “Bzzz!”

59
00:05:01,303 --> 00:05:02,554
Miss Big Bee,

60
00:05:02,763 --> 00:05:04,014
you've got something
on your head.

61
00:05:04,222 --> 00:05:05,766
- Is it heavy?
-Silence!

62
00:05:05,974 --> 00:05:09,478
Clean this up! This is a hive,
not a filthy hornet's nest.

63
00:05:09,686 --> 00:05:13,398
Pull your stinger in, Buzzlina.
She's just a baby.

64
00:05:13,607 --> 00:05:15,484
I'm sure it was an accident.

65
00:05:15,692 --> 00:05:17,152
If we allow bees to run amuck

66
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:19,529
like this the hive
will fall into chaos.

67
00:05:19,738 --> 00:05:22,240
She is right.
Every bee in this hive

68
00:05:22,449 --> 00:05:25,160
-has a role to play.
-What's my role?

69
00:05:25,368 --> 00:05:28,205
Patience, little one.
You'll find your place.

70
00:05:28,413 --> 00:05:30,999
You just need to learn how
everything works first.

71
00:05:31,208 --> 00:05:34,628
But she broke the rules.
She must be punished!

72
00:05:34,836 --> 00:05:38,089
See that she gets to
school safely, Buzzlina.

73
00:05:38,298 --> 00:05:40,842
Of course,
Your Majesty.

74
00:05:41,051 --> 00:05:43,220
"Every bee has
a role to play..."

75
00:05:45,013 --> 00:05:47,432
We must do something
about the Queen, Crawley.

76
00:05:47,641 --> 00:05:49,935
She's not fit to rule this hive.

77
00:05:50,143 --> 00:05:52,395
Right, you little menace...

78
00:06:04,533 --> 00:06:05,700
Hey!

79
00:06:09,538 --> 00:06:11,581
- Halt.
-Halt!

80
00:06:11,790 --> 00:06:15,961
- What kind of bee are you?
-A marchy bee, like you, silly.

81
00:06:16,169 --> 00:06:19,422
I hardly think so.
Bees don't behave like that.

82
00:06:19,631 --> 00:06:21,716
Fall in, soldier!

83
00:06:21,925 --> 00:06:22,801
Shoo.

84
00:06:37,315 --> 00:06:38,733
Attention!

85
00:06:44,322 --> 00:06:45,991
Attention!

86
00:07:07,971 --> 00:07:09,723
Wow.

87
00:07:27,782 --> 00:07:30,994
Whoa. Beautiful.

88
00:07:52,140 --> 00:07:55,185
Like a maple tree
in the fall...

89
00:07:55,393 --> 00:07:56,353
Oh, no.

90
00:07:56,561 --> 00:07:58,313
Too syrupy-

91
00:07:58,521 --> 00:08:01,399
Oh, so many colors!

92
00:08:01,608 --> 00:08:05,070
Yes!
Simple! To the point!

93
00:08:05,278 --> 00:08:06,863
So many colors...

94
00:08:07,072 --> 00:08:10,742
Nothing is as dull as
staying inside

95
00:08:10,951 --> 00:08:12,410
Kid, that's great.

96
00:08:12,619 --> 00:08:15,330
Where did you learn to write
songs like that? Hee-hop!

97
00:08:15,538 --> 00:08:18,124
It's like you're seeing the
world for the first time.

98
00:08:18,333 --> 00:08:21,044
You've got music in you, little
buzzer, and what goes in...

99
00:08:21,252 --> 00:08:22,212
"Laaaa!"

100
00:08:22,420 --> 00:08:25,006
must come out.
Come on, try it.

101
00:08:25,215 --> 00:08:26,424
"Laaaa!"

102
00:08:26,633 --> 00:08:28,176
"La-l,

103
00:08:28,385 --> 00:08:30,220
"Laaaa!"

104
00:08:31,805 --> 00:08:35,100
"LaaaaaaaaP'

105
00:08:36,434 --> 00:08:38,561
Uh,yeah.
Save some for later.

106
00:08:41,314 --> 00:08:44,484
- You're a funny green bee.
-Green bee?

107
00:08:46,403 --> 00:08:49,572
You are seeing the world
for the first time!

108
00:08:49,781 --> 00:08:50,949
Pardon me, little miss.

109
00:08:51,157 --> 00:08:53,159
Flip the grasshopper
is my name.

110
00:08:53,368 --> 00:08:54,869
Roaming the meadow
is my game.

111
00:08:55,078 --> 00:08:56,246
What's the meadow?

112
00:08:57,205 --> 00:08:58,331
What's the meadow?

113
00:08:58,540 --> 00:09:00,709
Kid, you got to get out more.
Hee-hop!

114
00:09:03,837 --> 00:09:05,505
There it is.

115
00:09:07,132 --> 00:09:10,719
The meadow...
my home.

116
00:09:10,927 --> 00:09:12,429
You live out here?

117
00:09:12,637 --> 00:09:15,390
Not just me. Lots of insects
live in the meadow.

118
00:09:15,598 --> 00:09:17,559
Big, small, funny, smelly.

119
00:09:17,767 --> 00:09:20,061
You name it.
It's everything you can see.

120
00:09:20,270 --> 00:09:24,024
Up, down, sky to ground from
your hive to the tulip beds,

121
00:09:24,232 --> 00:09:26,860
all the way
to Gorgo's hedge.

122
00:09:27,068 --> 00:09:30,613
Where no little bee
should ever go.

123
00:09:30,822 --> 00:09:31,906
Why?

124
00:09:32,115 --> 00:09:33,867
Because a giant
bug-eating monster

125
00:09:34,075 --> 00:09:35,660
named Gorge fives there.

126
00:09:35,869 --> 00:09:38,329
But enough of that!
Where are your friends?

127
00:09:38,538 --> 00:09:40,040
Bees always travel in groups.

128
00:09:40,248 --> 00:09:42,459
I don't think
I have any friends.

129
00:09:42,667 --> 00:09:44,294
No one in the hive likes me.

130
00:09:45,420 --> 00:09:47,797
Maybe I'm just
bad at being a bee.

131
00:09:48,006 --> 00:09:49,632
Sounds serious.

132
00:09:49,841 --> 00:09:52,844
Hey! Hey, what are you--

133
00:09:53,053 --> 00:09:55,096
Do not disturb the
great Dr. Flippenstein.

134
00:09:55,305 --> 00:09:57,098
You got a good heart, kid.
Say "Ah".

135
00:09:57,307 --> 00:09:58,183
Ah.

136
00:09:58,391 --> 00:10:00,643
What do you know?
Bees do have teeth.

137
00:10:00,852 --> 00:10:02,395
Beeswax... Promising.

138
00:10:04,022 --> 00:10:08,568
In my professional opinion,
the diagnosis is bee positive.

139
00:10:08,777 --> 00:10:10,236
You're a good
little buzzer, kid.

140
00:10:10,445 --> 00:10:13,406
Don't let anyone
say otherwise.

141
00:10:13,615 --> 00:10:16,034
Maybe we should get you
back to the hive, little one.

142
00:10:16,242 --> 00:10:18,078
No, Flip, can't I stay?

143
00:10:19,913 --> 00:10:21,206
Hee-hop!

144
00:10:28,379 --> 00:10:30,215
Approaching marigold
coordinates.

145
00:10:30,423 --> 00:10:33,259
Commence pollen
collection procedure.

146
00:10:51,861 --> 00:10:52,779
What is it?

147
00:10:54,614 --> 00:10:56,157
Hornets!

148
00:10:56,366 --> 00:10:58,243
Hold on to your buckets!

149
00:11:04,415 --> 00:11:06,584
Why so shy?

150
00:11:10,463 --> 00:11:12,465
Well, well, well.

151
00:11:12,674 --> 00:11:15,301
What do we got here?
Greedy little fluff-balls

152
00:11:15,510 --> 00:11:17,846
nabbing all the pollen
for themselves.

153
00:11:18,054 --> 00:11:19,597
Hold onto your buckets!

154
00:11:19,806 --> 00:11:21,266
Thieving buzz boxes about!

155
00:11:21,474 --> 00:11:24,185
Take that back, you
hoity toity hivecrawler.

156
00:11:24,394 --> 00:11:26,563
Hornets don't steal.

157
00:11:26,771 --> 00:11:29,524
Go back where you came from,
pollen-pinchers.

158
00:11:29,732 --> 00:11:32,694
We're shaking in our shells.

159
00:11:32,902 --> 00:11:34,821
Lucky for you
I've got a camp to set up.

160
00:11:35,029 --> 00:11:37,866
See you around... neighbor.

161
00:11:41,911 --> 00:11:43,955
There goes the neighborhood.

162
00:11:46,875 --> 00:11:49,002
Hey, my bucket's gone.

163
00:11:49,210 --> 00:11:52,422
- You see? Dirty thieves.
-Back to the hive!

164
00:11:52,630 --> 00:11:54,465
We need to report
this to the Queen.

165
00:11:54,674 --> 00:11:56,009
Oh dear.

166
00:11:59,637 --> 00:12:01,431
No, Flip-Bug, can't I stay?

167
00:12:01,639 --> 00:12:02,765
It's all so big

168
00:12:02,974 --> 00:12:05,852
and sunshiney out here,
and it smells so nice.

169
00:12:06,060 --> 00:12:08,646
Here you go, little buzzer.
I've got to hop.

170
00:12:08,855 --> 00:12:10,732
Bees don't like other bugs
hanging around the hive.

171
00:12:10,940 --> 00:12:13,234
- No, I want to stay!
-Don't worry,

172
00:12:14,819 --> 00:12:16,571
you'll see it again soon.

173
00:12:17,614 --> 00:12:20,116
- Really?
-Sure! Flowers and bees

174
00:12:20,325 --> 00:12:22,911
go together
like spiders and legs.

175
00:12:23,119 --> 00:12:25,872
But if you really want the
low-down on the meadow,

176
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:28,750
you just call old Flip.
You can find me...

177
00:12:28,958 --> 00:12:30,793
Bees don't talk to other bugs!

178
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:33,129
It wasn't another bug,
he was Flip.

179
00:12:33,338 --> 00:12:35,215
See you next time.
Hee-hop!

180
00:12:35,423 --> 00:12:37,926
Wait!
Flip, I want to go with you.

181
00:12:38,134 --> 00:12:41,804
Bees don't leave the hive
on their own. Now back to work!

182
00:12:42,013 --> 00:12:45,350
"Bees don't, bees never,
working bees, blah-blah-blah..."

183
00:12:45,558 --> 00:12:47,185
Bugs!

184
00:13:05,578 --> 00:13:08,665
Buzz! Buzz! Buzz!

185
00:13:21,886 --> 00:13:23,805
As Royal Adviser,

186
00:13:24,013 --> 00:13:27,517
I must strongly advise you
to repel the hornets.

187
00:13:27,725 --> 00:13:29,394
But they did not attack us.

188
00:13:29,602 --> 00:13:31,980
Well, no, not yet.

189
00:13:32,188 --> 00:13:34,399
But if we let them
set up camp,

190
00:13:34,607 --> 00:13:36,985
all the other
hornet tribes will follow.

191
00:13:37,193 --> 00:13:39,320
They'll surely
turn our meadow

192
00:13:39,529 --> 00:13:41,614
into a big
horrible hornet's nest.

193
00:13:41,823 --> 00:13:44,617
They'll kill all the flowers
and bugs. And then...

194
00:13:44,826 --> 00:13:47,870
Oh, and then
they'll eat us.

195
00:13:48,079 --> 00:13:50,832
We must show them
who's in charge.

196
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:54,335
I am in charge,
remember?

197
00:13:54,544 --> 00:13:56,587
Your Majesty...

198
00:14:01,926 --> 00:14:06,139
That's all of it, Your Majesty.
This year's royal jelly harvest.

199
00:14:11,769 --> 00:14:14,230
Crawley, what's the problem?

200
00:14:14,439 --> 00:14:16,566
It appears to be blocked,
Your Adviseyness.

201
00:14:16,774 --> 00:14:18,693
Of course it's blocked.
Unblock it.

202
00:14:18,901 --> 00:14:20,945
- Me? But...
-Just do it.

203
00:14:21,154 --> 00:14:22,488
Of course, Ma'am.

204
00:14:29,078 --> 00:14:30,663
The royal jelly!

205
00:14:33,499 --> 00:14:35,168
That smells yummy.

206
00:14:35,376 --> 00:14:38,296
"Yummy?" Do you realize
what you almost did?

207
00:14:38,504 --> 00:14:40,840
This is a year's
supply of royal jelly, child.

208
00:14:41,049 --> 00:14:43,384
The Queen's life depends on it.

209
00:14:43,593 --> 00:14:45,887
She can't eat anything else.

210
00:14:46,095 --> 00:14:49,932
She can't eat anything else...

211
00:14:50,141 --> 00:14:51,225
Crawley...

212
00:14:51,434 --> 00:14:53,978
Are you thinking
what I'm thinking?

213
00:14:54,187 --> 00:14:56,230
Ladybugs aren't always ladies?

214
00:14:56,439 --> 00:14:59,984
I'm thinking this royal
jelly is the answer to our

215
00:15:00,193 --> 00:15:03,446
little problem
with the Queen.

216
00:15:03,654 --> 00:15:07,075
- I'm sorry, Miss Queen.
-My, that was quite an entrance.

217
00:15:07,283 --> 00:15:09,327
- Are you all right, my dear?
-Oh, yes.

218
00:15:09,535 --> 00:15:12,455
The flower-fluff was very soft.
And tasty.

219
00:15:16,876 --> 00:15:18,920
You're a wild one, aren't you?

220
00:15:19,128 --> 00:15:22,590
I can see I'm going to have
to keep an eye on you.

221
00:15:22,799 --> 00:15:24,175
Which eye, Miss Queen?

222
00:15:24,384 --> 00:15:26,552
Silence!
I told you to behave.

223
00:15:26,761 --> 00:15:29,764
And I told you to
take her to school.

224
00:15:31,015 --> 00:15:33,893
Er... of course, Your Majesty.

225
00:15:34,102 --> 00:15:35,520
Buzz, buzz, Buzzlina.

226
00:15:37,188 --> 00:15:38,815
You!school

227
00:15:44,153 --> 00:15:46,406
The meadow
isn't all flowers and sunshine.

228
00:15:46,614 --> 00:15:49,575
There are dangers, too.
Like hornets.

229
00:15:49,784 --> 00:15:52,537
Hornets!
Hide, everyone!

230
00:15:54,539 --> 00:15:55,873
Hornets!

231
00:15:59,293 --> 00:16:01,712
- What was that?
-Oh, Willi!

232
00:16:01,921 --> 00:16:03,673
How will you ever
recognise a hornet

233
00:16:03,881 --> 00:16:05,466
if you're always
asleep in my class?

234
00:16:05,675 --> 00:16:08,511
Me? No, no, no.
That was just my eyes.

235
00:16:08,719 --> 00:16:10,012
They take a break sometimes.

236
00:16:11,764 --> 00:16:15,518
Stop that infernal racket.
Bees don't sing!

237
00:16:15,726 --> 00:16:16,936
But Why?

238
00:16:17,145 --> 00:16:19,397
Because singing
leads to playing,

239
00:16:19,605 --> 00:16:23,234
and playing leads to laziness.
And a lazy bee!

240
00:16:23,443 --> 00:16:25,319
Gorge, the bee-munching

241
00:16:25,528 --> 00:16:28,156
hedge-monster,
just loves lazy bees.

242
00:16:29,615 --> 00:16:31,617
Gorge...

243
00:16:32,869 --> 00:16:35,872
Thank you for that
colorful description.

244
00:16:36,080 --> 00:16:38,708
- We've been expecting you, Maya.
-Maya?

245
00:16:38,916 --> 00:16:40,960
Well, yes... That's your name.

246
00:16:41,169 --> 00:16:42,295
Really?

247
00:16:42,503 --> 00:16:44,046
Maya.

248
00:16:44,255 --> 00:16:45,798
I like that.

249
00:16:46,007 --> 00:16:47,300
Maya.

250
00:16:47,508 --> 00:16:50,178
Maya.
Maya the Bee.

251
00:16:51,345 --> 00:16:53,848
Come along, little one.
Take a seat.

252
00:16:54,056 --> 00:16:55,516
A word, Buzzlina.

253
00:16:55,725 --> 00:16:57,310
What are you doing?

254
00:16:57,518 --> 00:16:58,936
Sitting next to you.

255
00:16:59,145 --> 00:17:01,397
But nobody ever sits next to me.

256
00:17:01,606 --> 00:17:04,817
I mean, excellent choice,
Maya. I'm Willi.

257
00:17:05,026 --> 00:17:07,528
Stick with me.
I know lots of things.

258
00:17:07,737 --> 00:17:10,031
This is my third First Flight
coming up, you know.

259
00:17:10,239 --> 00:17:14,494
Wow.
You must know everything.

260
00:17:14,702 --> 00:17:16,704
You're not like any
other bee I've met.

261
00:17:18,247 --> 00:17:21,000
- I keep hearing that.
-No, no, no.

262
00:17:21,209 --> 00:17:22,752
I meant that
in a good way.

263
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:26,088
- We can be First Flight buddies.
-I'd like that!

264
00:17:26,297 --> 00:17:28,883
Miss Teaching Bee, when do
we go on our First Flight?

265
00:17:29,091 --> 00:17:30,593
SHence,396!

266
00:17:30,801 --> 00:17:32,595
My name is Maya.

267
00:17:34,138 --> 00:17:35,515
Patience, Maya.

268
00:17:35,723 --> 00:17:37,767
You must learn
about the dangers first.

269
00:17:37,975 --> 00:17:39,644
We were just talking
about hornets.

270
00:17:39,852 --> 00:17:41,020
What's a hornet?

271
00:17:41,229 --> 00:17:43,814
Why, just a
bee's worst enemy.

272
00:17:44,023 --> 00:17:45,942
Great big scaly things,

273
00:17:46,150 --> 00:17:49,403
with giant claws
and red eyes.

274
00:17:49,612 --> 00:17:51,697
They like nothing more

275
00:17:51,906 --> 00:17:55,743
than dipping baby-bees
in pollen dust for their supper.

276
00:17:57,370 --> 00:17:59,372
They change into horrible,

277
00:17:59,580 --> 00:18:01,916
howling beasts at night.

278
00:18:03,292 --> 00:18:06,504
Their disgusting fuzz
hides parasites

279
00:18:06,712 --> 00:18:09,382
that are trained
to attack hornets.

280
00:18:09,590 --> 00:18:11,801
And if you let them get close,

281
00:18:12,009 --> 00:18:16,305
they'll suck your soul
right out of your body.

282
00:18:22,144 --> 00:18:23,020
Sorry.

283
00:18:24,188 --> 00:18:27,275
Son, you're not going to cry,
are you?

284
00:18:27,483 --> 00:18:30,194
I haven't raised a
bee-baby, have I?

285
00:18:30,403 --> 00:18:32,321
Dad, I hate bees.

286
00:18:32,530 --> 00:18:34,490
That's my boy.

287
00:18:34,699 --> 00:18:36,450
Play safe and stay in camp.

288
00:18:36,659 --> 00:18:38,452
Bees roam all
over these parts.

289
00:18:38,661 --> 00:18:39,870
Dad, no fair!

290
00:18:40,079 --> 00:18:42,623
I want to see one of
those dirty soul-suckers.

291
00:18:42,832 --> 00:18:44,250
Maybe when
you're bigger, son.

292
00:18:44,458 --> 00:18:45,960
- I am big.
-Look what you've done!

293
00:18:46,168 --> 00:18:47,837
- I barely touched it!
-That's the third time today!

294
00:18:51,465 --> 00:18:54,719
By my shiny shell!
Stay where I can see you, son.

295
00:18:54,927 --> 00:18:56,887
- But, Dad...
-No buts!

296
00:18:57,096 --> 00:18:58,639
I said stay in camp.

297
00:18:58,848 --> 00:19:01,225
- Look what you did .
-Move your pincers, lazy bugs!

298
00:19:01,434 --> 00:19:04,020
I want this camp
up by nightfall!

299
00:19:04,228 --> 00:19:06,939
I'm big enough. Hey!
Who wants to join my secret

300
00:19:07,148 --> 00:19:08,441
Bug Hunters' Club?

301
00:19:09,609 --> 00:19:12,570
Scaredy bugs.
I'll go on my own, then!

302
00:19:15,698 --> 00:19:17,325
And remember, children,

303
00:19:17,533 --> 00:19:20,119
bugs eat bees and
they don't say please.

304
00:19:20,328 --> 00:19:23,956
And that's why we don't trust
any other bugs. Ever.

305
00:19:24,165 --> 00:19:25,416
But what if they're your friend

306
00:19:25,625 --> 00:19:27,043
or they're really,
really pretty?

307
00:19:27,251 --> 00:19:28,711
Or you need their help?

308
00:19:28,919 --> 00:19:32,256
I would rather die
than ask another bug for help.

309
00:19:32,465 --> 00:19:34,008
Isn't that kind of silly?

310
00:19:35,885 --> 00:19:37,762
I guess it is.

311
00:19:39,096 --> 00:19:40,431
Miss Cassandra!

312
00:19:41,432 --> 00:19:43,059
I'm warning you, 396.

313
00:19:43,267 --> 00:19:45,061
No more interruptions.

314
00:19:45,269 --> 00:19:46,854
Something you want to say,

315
00:19:47,063 --> 00:19:48,689
-396?
-Uh-uh!

316
00:19:48,898 --> 00:19:50,816
Good.

317
00:19:54,278 --> 00:19:56,155
But I just met a nice bug
and he didn't eat me.

318
00:19:56,364 --> 00:19:57,865
How can the meadow be
so bad when it's so pretty?

319
00:19:58,074 --> 00:19:59,033
That doesn't
even make sense.

320
00:19:59,241 --> 00:20:00,826
And really, why are
hornets so awful

321
00:20:01,035 --> 00:20:02,036
if you haven't even
met them either?

322
00:20:02,244 --> 00:20:03,412
And who is Gorgo, anyway?

323
00:20:03,621 --> 00:20:05,414
Why can't I laugh or dance
or play or leave the hive

324
00:20:05,623 --> 00:20:06,707
when it feels so good?

325
00:20:06,916 --> 00:20:08,834
Just because of some dumb
old crinkle face who's

326
00:20:09,001 --> 00:20:10,294
a funny looking bee
and won't even

327
00:20:10,503 --> 00:20:12,672
-let you si-ing?
-Uh-oh.

328
00:20:15,174 --> 00:20:19,136
That's it!
You're banned from First Flight.

329
00:20:19,345 --> 00:20:21,222
And all other flights.

330
00:20:24,517 --> 00:20:26,852
Follow me, children.
Stay close.

331
00:20:27,061 --> 00:20:29,563
And remember to
flap those wings.

332
00:20:40,116 --> 00:20:41,992
Hey, what are
you doing here?

333
00:20:42,201 --> 00:20:44,370
Why aren't you
out with the others?

334
00:20:44,578 --> 00:20:47,039
I couldn't leave
you alone, could I?

335
00:20:48,874 --> 00:20:51,752
Oh, Willi,
you're my best friend ever.

336
00:20:51,961 --> 00:20:53,504
You're the best.

337
00:20:53,713 --> 00:20:55,840
And you're my first friend ever.

338
00:20:56,048 --> 00:20:58,092
- Huh?
-Nothing. Nothing.

339
00:21:02,888 --> 00:21:05,057
What's wrong with me, Willi?

340
00:21:05,266 --> 00:21:08,561
- Why don't I fit into this hive?
-Fitting in is easy.

341
00:21:08,769 --> 00:21:11,188
Just stop asking questions
and follow orders.

342
00:21:11,397 --> 00:21:13,149
That's what the rest of us do.

343
00:21:13,357 --> 00:21:15,276
Of course, then you
wouldn't be crazy,

344
00:21:15,484 --> 00:21:17,236
funny Maya anymore.

345
00:21:17,445 --> 00:21:20,030
You'll be like every
other buzzer.

346
00:21:20,239 --> 00:21:23,492
You're right, Willi.
I'm the problem, not the hive!

347
00:21:23,701 --> 00:21:25,745
I have to tell
the Royal Adviser.

348
00:21:25,953 --> 00:21:28,122
From now on,
I'll do as I'm told.

349
00:21:28,330 --> 00:21:30,583
Maybe don't say
that it was my idea.

350
00:21:30,791 --> 00:21:33,544
- Maya'>
-She's '

351
00:21:33,753 --> 00:21:34,920
Crawley?

352
00:21:35,129 --> 00:21:37,882
Crawley, you sniveling sneak,
show yourself.

353
00:21:38,090 --> 00:21:40,426
Here I am,
Your Advisorness.

354
00:21:40,634 --> 00:21:41,761
Is it done?

355
00:21:41,969 --> 00:21:43,095
Of course.

356
00:21:46,974 --> 00:21:48,434
Dear me, Crawley.

357
00:21:48,642 --> 00:21:52,688
You know, I think the hornets
have stolen the royal jelly.

358
00:21:52,897 --> 00:21:55,858
But isn't that the royal jelly?

359
00:21:56,066 --> 00:21:59,320
We must find the dirty thieves
and destroy their camp.

360
00:21:59,528 --> 00:22:00,613
Mustn't we?

361
00:22:01,572 --> 00:22:03,657
But they didn't steal it.

362
00:22:03,866 --> 00:22:05,159
- We--
-I know they didn't!

363
00:22:05,367 --> 00:22:07,995
But the others don't know that,
do they, Crawley?

364
00:22:12,583 --> 00:22:15,044
- There you are, Miss Adviser...
-396?

365
00:22:15,252 --> 00:22:16,837
I came to say...

366
00:22:17,046 --> 00:22:18,839
What are you doing
with the royal jelly?

367
00:22:19,048 --> 00:22:20,508
Silence! I warned you!

368
00:22:20,716 --> 00:22:22,134
Bees don't ask questions.

369
00:22:22,343 --> 00:22:23,803
- Get out!
-Wait, Miss Advisorness.

370
00:22:24,011 --> 00:22:25,012
You were right.

371
00:22:25,221 --> 00:22:27,890
- I have to learn all your rules.
-impossible.

372
00:22:28,098 --> 00:22:30,267
There's no place in this hive
for troublemakers.

373
00:22:30,476 --> 00:22:31,894
No, I can change.

374
00:22:32,102 --> 00:22:35,022
- I promise I'll try.
-Forget it, 396.

375
00:22:35,231 --> 00:22:36,941
You don't belong here.

376
00:22:37,149 --> 00:22:39,985
You are banished
from this hive.

377
00:22:40,194 --> 00:22:43,197
Banished...
But where will I go?

378
00:22:43,405 --> 00:22:47,493
It's the meadow for
wretched little bugs like you.

379
00:22:47,701 --> 00:22:49,411
Good, I like bugs!

380
00:22:49,620 --> 00:22:52,706
They're a lot nicer
than you, you big bully!

381
00:22:52,915 --> 00:22:54,792
Then go, 396.

382
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,336
I'm sure there's a
meadow full of bugs

383
00:22:57,545 --> 00:22:59,797
just waiting to meet you.

384
00:23:01,298 --> 00:23:02,967
Or eat you.

385
00:23:05,928 --> 00:23:07,638
Mean old bully bee.

386
00:23:07,847 --> 00:23:08,973
I'll show you.

387
00:23:09,181 --> 00:23:12,017
There's a place for me
out here somewhere.

388
00:23:26,323 --> 00:23:27,408
Okay"-...

389
00:23:36,792 --> 00:23:37,751
Maya?

390
00:23:45,301 --> 00:23:47,219
Hey! I'm flying!

391
00:23:52,725 --> 00:23:56,395
But I don't think little bees
can survive out in the meadow.

392
00:23:56,604 --> 00:23:58,063
Exactly.

393
00:23:58,272 --> 00:24:03,777
Go after her and see
that nature takes its course.

394
00:24:03,986 --> 00:24:05,279
Oh, no.

395
00:24:05,487 --> 00:24:08,407
You have to save her, Willi.
No. She'll be all right.

396
00:24:08,616 --> 00:24:11,327
No, she won't.
Just do it.

397
00:24:11,535 --> 00:24:14,580
Maya!
Wait, Maya!

398
00:24:14,788 --> 00:24:15,748
Maya!

399
00:24:52,076 --> 00:24:54,203
Hello, meadow!
I'm here.

400
00:24:55,913 --> 00:24:58,165
Oh, a shiny plant.

401
00:24:58,374 --> 00:25:00,209
Hey, that's not nice.

402
00:25:26,485 --> 00:25:29,613
I'm coming to save you, Maya.

403
00:25:29,822 --> 00:25:31,073
Willi?

404
00:25:47,256 --> 00:25:49,383
Don't worry. Willi's here.

405
00:25:49,591 --> 00:25:51,385
It's me, Willi!

406
00:25:51,593 --> 00:25:53,762
Maya.
What are you doing out here?

407
00:25:53,971 --> 00:25:57,558
I've left the hive, Willi,
and I'm never ever coming back.

408
00:25:57,766 --> 00:26:00,436
Yeah, right. Right.
Good one.

409
00:26:00,644 --> 00:26:01,353
You what?!

410
00:26:02,688 --> 00:26:05,149
The Royal Adviser says
I don't belong there.

411
00:26:05,357 --> 00:26:10,320
But so far I haven't been doing
so well out here, either.

412
00:26:10,529 --> 00:26:13,782
I don't think I fit
in anywhere, Willi.

413
00:26:13,991 --> 00:26:15,909
Maya, you're a bee.

414
00:26:16,118 --> 00:26:17,536
Bees live in hives.

415
00:26:17,745 --> 00:26:19,121
Even I know that.

416
00:26:19,329 --> 00:26:21,206
You can't survive out here
on your own.

417
00:26:21,415 --> 00:26:23,375
Well, I'm not on
my own now.

418
00:26:23,584 --> 00:26:25,210
Oh, great!
That's just great.

419
00:26:25,419 --> 00:26:26,879
We'll both get eaten!

420
00:26:27,087 --> 00:26:28,172
- Flip!
"No!

421
00:26:28,380 --> 00:26:30,215
Now you're flipping out on me?

422
00:26:30,424 --> 00:26:33,343
No.
Flip the crazy grass jumper.

423
00:26:33,552 --> 00:26:35,345
He knows how to
live in the meadow.

424
00:26:35,554 --> 00:26:37,014
He can show me where I fit in.

425
00:26:37,222 --> 00:26:39,016
I'm not going back
out there in the dark.

426
00:26:39,224 --> 00:26:41,226
We'll have to wait
until the morning.

427
00:26:43,270 --> 00:26:46,190
If we get eaten tonight,
I'll never forgive you.

428
00:26:54,740 --> 00:26:57,284
Did the frogs get her?

429
00:26:57,493 --> 00:26:59,411
Of course, Ma'am.

430
00:26:59,620 --> 00:27:01,205
Exceflent

431
00:27:05,542 --> 00:27:07,669
Maya? Willi?

432
00:27:09,546 --> 00:27:10,964
Kids!

433
00:27:22,768 --> 00:27:24,895
Grub, leaf, rock.

434
00:27:25,104 --> 00:27:26,480
Leaf covers rock.

435
00:27:26,688 --> 00:27:27,940
You learn quickly.

436
00:27:28,148 --> 00:27:30,818
- Grub, leaf, rock.
-I win again.

437
00:27:31,026 --> 00:27:33,821
Nom, nom, nom.
Caterpillar eats your leaf.

438
00:27:34,029 --> 00:27:36,490
You look outside first.

439
00:27:36,698 --> 00:27:40,285
Well, I would have looked first
even if I had won.

440
00:27:40,494 --> 00:27:42,538
That's just the
kind of bee I am.

441
00:27:48,127 --> 00:27:50,420
- What is it, Willi?
-A monster.

442
00:27:50,629 --> 00:27:54,049
With big eyes and fangs,
ready to eat us.

443
00:27:57,553 --> 00:27:58,804
How pretty.

444
00:27:59,012 --> 00:28:00,597
Are you sure
that's a monster, Willi?

445
00:28:00,806 --> 00:28:03,934
Is it gone? Don't worry.
I shooed it away.

446
00:28:04,143 --> 00:28:07,938
- With an attack shriek.
-Thank you, my protector.

447
00:28:08,147 --> 00:28:12,192
So where is this flippity
grass jumper of yours?

448
00:28:12,401 --> 00:28:14,403
Somewhere in the meadow.

449
00:28:14,611 --> 00:28:15,904
That narrows it down.

450
00:28:16,113 --> 00:28:19,408
I guess we'll need to ask
some bugs for directions.

451
00:28:19,616 --> 00:28:22,661
Maya...
You're so going to get us eaten.

452
00:28:25,539 --> 00:28:27,082
Son!

453
00:28:27,291 --> 00:28:30,335
Son? Son!

454
00:28:30,544 --> 00:28:31,879
Son?

455
00:28:32,087 --> 00:28:33,130
Boy!

456
00:28:33,338 --> 00:28:36,592
Sweet cola cans.
Where's my little nipper got to?

457
00:28:36,800 --> 00:28:37,551
Hey, wake up!

458
00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:41,346
How can you sleep
when my boy's missing?

459
00:28:41,555 --> 00:28:43,056
- What's he missing, boss?
-What?!

460
00:28:43,265 --> 00:28:45,726
No, he's missing!
I can't find him.

461
00:28:45,934 --> 00:28:47,644
He must have
snuck out last night.

462
00:28:47,853 --> 00:28:50,772
Let's move out!
And I mean everybody, out!

463
00:28:50,981 --> 00:28:52,482
I want my boy back!

464
00:28:55,819 --> 00:28:56,987
Son!

465
00:29:01,366 --> 00:29:03,285
Wait, Maya.

466
00:29:03,493 --> 00:29:05,037
I'm hungry again.

467
00:29:05,245 --> 00:29:08,081
Come on, Willi.
We've got to find Flip.

468
00:29:08,290 --> 00:29:09,541
I'm tired.

469
00:29:09,750 --> 00:29:13,337
- You're always tired.
-I'm a growing bee.

470
00:29:14,796 --> 00:29:16,506
I need my sleep.

471
00:29:17,966 --> 00:29:19,968
There's something
under that leaf.

472
00:29:20,177 --> 00:29:24,681
- Maybe it knows where Flip is.
-Maya! What are you doing?

473
00:29:24,890 --> 00:29:28,560
He doesn't look too dangerous.
He's stripy and little like us.

474
00:29:28,769 --> 00:29:31,980
- But kind of shiny, too.
-I'm not little.

475
00:29:32,189 --> 00:29:34,733
- Hello.
-Hey, get your own leaf.

476
00:29:36,235 --> 00:29:38,987
We're looking for a big green
crazy bug called Flip.

477
00:29:39,196 --> 00:29:41,615
- Have you seen him?
-Huh, baby stuff.

478
00:29:41,823 --> 00:29:43,408
I'm looking for...

479
00:29:43,617 --> 00:29:45,619
No, I can't tell you.

480
00:29:45,827 --> 00:29:47,287
Unless

481
00:29:47,496 --> 00:29:50,040
you join my secret
Bug Hunters' Club.

482
00:29:50,249 --> 00:29:51,875
No, Maya.
There's an old hive saying:

483
00:29:52,042 --> 00:29:53,335
"No clubs with strange bugs."

484
00:29:53,543 --> 00:29:55,629
who're you calling
strange, fuzz face?

485
00:29:55,837 --> 00:29:58,298
- We're in!
-I like you.

486
00:29:58,507 --> 00:30:00,133
You've got guts.

487
00:30:00,342 --> 00:30:04,429
Okay. Hold onto your stripes.
Cause I'm hunting the greediest,

488
00:30:04,638 --> 00:30:07,182
most disgustingest
bugs in the meadow.

489
00:30:07,391 --> 00:30:10,394
Honey guzzling soul-suckers.

490
00:30:10,602 --> 00:30:12,562
Oh, yeah!
I want to meet these nice bugs.

491
00:30:12,771 --> 00:30:14,231
No, you don't!
No, she doesn't!

492
00:30:14,439 --> 00:30:17,317
Let's go, Bug Hunters!
Danger calls.

493
00:30:20,779 --> 00:30:22,823
What kind of bug are you,
anyway?

494
00:30:23,031 --> 00:30:24,866
The best kind. Sting.

495
00:30:25,075 --> 00:30:27,661
"Stink-Bug."
Yeah, good one.

496
00:30:27,869 --> 00:30:30,580
- Really, though, what are you?
-What do you think? I'm a...

497
00:30:30,789 --> 00:30:32,582
- Hornets!
-Hornets?

498
00:30:32,791 --> 00:30:35,544
- Son!
-Oh, no. Dad.

499
00:30:35,752 --> 00:30:37,879
- Hornets!
-Really?

500
00:30:38,088 --> 00:30:41,425
Hide, Maya! They'll munch you!
Tell her, Stink-Bug.

501
00:30:41,633 --> 00:30:43,260
Stink-Bug?

502
00:30:43,468 --> 00:30:45,470
I thought he was our new friend.

503
00:30:45,679 --> 00:30:48,473
The hornets got him, Maya.
And we're next!

504
00:30:48,682 --> 00:30:51,310
There's an old bee saying:

505
00:30:51,518 --> 00:30:53,520
"Stay in the hive, stay alive."

506
00:30:55,605 --> 00:30:57,983
These are dark times, bees.

507
00:30:58,191 --> 00:31:00,569
The hive is in grave danger.

508
00:31:00,777 --> 00:31:04,614
Today hornets broke in
and stole our royal jelly.

509
00:31:04,823 --> 00:31:09,077
We must get it back.
The Queen's life depends on it.

510
00:31:09,286 --> 00:31:10,787
But we have no proof.

511
00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:15,250
Crawley, I think the
Queen needs to lie down.

512
00:31:15,459 --> 00:31:18,295
- This way, Your Majesty.
-We mustn't jump to conclusions.

513
00:31:18,503 --> 00:31:20,964
It's time we showed
those grubby hornets

514
00:31:21,173 --> 00:31:23,675
who runs this meadow.

515
00:31:24,885 --> 00:31:25,927
Wait!

516
00:31:26,136 --> 00:31:29,181
Maya and Willi
have disappeared.

517
00:31:29,389 --> 00:31:31,391
They must have gone outside.

518
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:33,352
I'm no nursemaid.

519
00:31:33,560 --> 00:31:35,437
Babies are your department.

520
00:31:35,645 --> 00:31:39,483
Now if you don't mind
I've got a hive to save.

521
00:31:39,691 --> 00:31:42,277
No. Wait. Wait!

522
00:31:42,486 --> 00:31:44,363
We have to do something.

523
00:31:44,571 --> 00:31:45,864
Please.

524
00:31:48,617 --> 00:31:50,118
Well, tickle my pincers!

525
00:31:50,327 --> 00:31:52,162
I never thought I'd see the day

526
00:31:52,371 --> 00:31:54,498
when a bee would
ask an ant for help.

527
00:31:54,706 --> 00:31:56,625
Oh please, Colonel.

528
00:31:56,833 --> 00:31:58,418
Don't worry, ma'am.
We'll find them.

529
00:31:58,627 --> 00:32:00,712
Men! We're looking
for two baby bees.

530
00:32:00,921 --> 00:32:04,674
Fuzzy, stripey, boogly eyes
and bobbly heads. Get it?

531
00:32:04,883 --> 00:32:06,760
Boogly eyes and
bobbly heads, Sir!

532
00:32:06,968 --> 00:32:09,137
Good.
Bart, Bert, that way!

533
00:32:09,346 --> 00:32:10,764
Tex, Lex, that way!

534
00:32:10,972 --> 00:32:12,557
Troy, Trey, over there!

535
00:32:13,433 --> 00:32:14,559
Arnie...

536
00:32:14,768 --> 00:32:16,353
...and Barney.

537
00:32:16,561 --> 00:32:17,979
- Yes, Sir!
-Reporting for duty, Sir!

538
00:32:18,188 --> 00:32:20,982
- Turn around! No, not you, the--
-Yes, Sir!

539
00:32:21,191 --> 00:32:23,860
- Turn around, you on the left!
-Yes, Sir!

540
00:32:24,069 --> 00:32:25,737
I meant my left!

541
00:32:25,946 --> 00:32:28,073
Your left when you're facing us,
Sir, or when you're facing away?

542
00:32:28,281 --> 00:32:29,616
- Sir?
-Oh, forget it.

543
00:32:29,825 --> 00:32:31,743
Sir!
Forgetting it now, Sir.

544
00:32:38,750 --> 00:32:40,377
Just go...

545
00:32:40,585 --> 00:32:42,129
somewhere over that way.

546
00:32:42,337 --> 00:32:44,840
And don't break anything!
I order you

547
00:32:45,048 --> 00:32:46,925
-not to break anything.
-Yes, Sir!

548
00:32:47,134 --> 00:32:48,802
You can count on us, Sir,
not to break anything.

549
00:32:49,010 --> 00:32:50,345
Sir, Sir yes Sir!
Breaking everything, Sir!

550
00:32:50,554 --> 00:32:51,972
No, we've got to
not break anything.

551
00:32:52,180 --> 00:32:53,598
Not breaking everything, Sir!

552
00:32:53,807 --> 00:32:56,017
- My foot!
-I'll thump you...

553
00:32:57,018 --> 00:32:59,104
- Attention!
-Yes, Sir!

554
00:33:00,522 --> 00:33:03,608
- Just go.
-Yes, Sir!

555
00:33:03,817 --> 00:33:05,485
Hut, hut, hut, hut, hut,
hut, hut, hut, hut, hut...

556
00:33:08,864 --> 00:33:12,284
Sir, request permission
to ask a question, Sir.

557
00:33:12,492 --> 00:33:13,910
Go ahead, soldier.

558
00:33:14,119 --> 00:33:16,329
What was the
mission again, Sir?

559
00:33:18,373 --> 00:33:21,418
Find those little bees!

560
00:33:23,545 --> 00:33:25,714
Round and round and round!

561
00:33:25,922 --> 00:33:28,091
I've got a bad feeling
about this.

562
00:33:28,300 --> 00:33:29,801
And I don't
frighten easily.

563
00:33:30,010 --> 00:33:31,511
Oh, don't be a fluff belly.

564
00:33:31,720 --> 00:33:33,013
They sound tiny.

565
00:33:33,221 --> 00:33:33,763
Hello!

566
00:33:35,432 --> 00:33:39,603
Don't be scared, little ones.
We just need some directions.

567
00:33:39,811 --> 00:33:41,897
Okay. No one there.
Let's go.

568
00:33:42,105 --> 00:33:43,231
Oh, Willi. Come on!

569
00:33:44,274 --> 00:33:45,567
Visitors!

570
00:33:46,401 --> 00:33:49,029
Say hello, my children.

571
00:33:49,237 --> 00:33:50,739
Hello!

572
00:33:50,947 --> 00:33:53,617
Just in time for breakfast.

573
00:33:53,825 --> 00:33:55,744
And I'm hungry.

574
00:33:57,162 --> 00:34:00,999
What about you guys?
We've got some rotten fruit.

575
00:34:01,208 --> 00:34:03,376
So, what brings you
little pollinators

576
00:34:03,585 --> 00:34:04,920
to the House of Moth?

577
00:34:05,128 --> 00:34:07,797
We're, um, looking for
a bug called Flip.

578
00:34:08,006 --> 00:34:09,257
The grasshopper?

579
00:34:09,466 --> 00:34:10,592
Cool!

580
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:12,886
He'll be cutting loose
at the big party.

581
00:34:13,094 --> 00:34:15,388
A party?
How do we get there?

582
00:34:15,597 --> 00:34:17,682
Easy.
Wait for the sun to set,

583
00:34:17,891 --> 00:34:20,727
then fly straight
till you find a bright light,

584
00:34:20,936 --> 00:34:24,648
and just go round and
round and round...

585
00:34:26,483 --> 00:34:29,027
I think we need
different directions, Willi.

586
00:34:29,236 --> 00:34:30,278
I agree.

587
00:34:32,948 --> 00:34:34,699
Maybe he knows
where the party is.

588
00:34:34,908 --> 00:34:37,118
No, Maya.
That's a dung beetle.

589
00:34:37,327 --> 00:34:38,787
They say one
whiff of that ball

590
00:34:38,995 --> 00:34:40,664
can knock a bee
right out of the sky.

591
00:34:40,872 --> 00:34:42,749
How bad can it be?

592
00:34:45,335 --> 00:34:48,380
Excuse me, Mr. Dung-Roller.

593
00:34:48,588 --> 00:34:52,592
What?
But... nobody ever talks to me.

594
00:34:52,801 --> 00:34:54,469
We're looking for the big party.

595
00:34:54,678 --> 00:34:57,430
I never get invited to parties.

596
00:34:57,639 --> 00:35:00,183
Apparently I've got odor issues.

597
00:35:00,392 --> 00:35:03,645
- You could come with us.
-Oh, thanks, Littlun'.

598
00:35:03,853 --> 00:35:07,274
But not all insects take as
kindly as you to old Kurt.

599
00:35:07,482 --> 00:35:08,483
You go on, though.

600
00:35:08,692 --> 00:35:11,111
Parties usually happen
at Jitterbug Hollow.

601
00:35:11,319 --> 00:35:13,029
I'll show you the way.
First you've got to...

602
00:35:13,238 --> 00:35:14,489
Here, hold this.

603
00:35:14,698 --> 00:35:17,576
So, to get to Jitterbug Hollow,
you follow this trench

604
00:35:17,784 --> 00:35:19,494
then you turn
left at the daisies.

605
00:35:19,703 --> 00:35:20,996
And when you
get to the river,

606
00:35:21,204 --> 00:35:23,623
you've got to follow it all the
way around Gorgo's hedge,

607
00:35:23,832 --> 00:35:26,251
My ball!
Whatever you do,

608
00:35:26,459 --> 00:35:29,504
don't go through Spider Forest!

609
00:35:29,713 --> 00:35:33,133
Go through
Spider Forest, got it.

610
00:35:33,341 --> 00:35:33,967
Maya, you stink.

611
00:35:35,093 --> 00:35:36,928
- You want a hug, Willi?
-No no no.

612
00:35:37,137 --> 00:35:39,389
- No. No!
-Give me a hug!

613
00:35:39,598 --> 00:35:42,267
- Help! Help!
-Come back here, Willi!

614
00:35:42,475 --> 00:35:46,563
- Hut, hut, hut, hut, hut, hut...
-That's it!

615
00:35:46,771 --> 00:35:49,149
Any more huts and
we'd be a village.

616
00:35:49,357 --> 00:35:50,650
Where are we?

617
00:35:50,859 --> 00:35:53,987
Shh! I'm picking up bee vibes.
And something else, too.

618
00:35:55,614 --> 00:35:58,116
Kind of strong-smelling...

619
00:35:58,325 --> 00:35:59,993
Pollen? Is it pollen?

620
00:36:00,201 --> 00:36:01,828
Where there's bees,
there's always pollen.

621
00:36:02,037 --> 00:36:03,455
That's got to be pollen.

622
00:36:03,663 --> 00:36:06,458
Pollen!
Come to Papa!

623
00:36:11,379 --> 00:36:13,673
This doesn't smell like pollen.

624
00:36:15,258 --> 00:36:17,218
And it certainly doesn't
taste like pollen.

625
00:36:25,185 --> 00:36:29,522
"Oh, it's easy, just go
through the Spider Forest."

626
00:36:29,731 --> 00:36:33,151
What kind of sick, twisted
dung beetle was he?

627
00:36:33,360 --> 00:36:36,571
See? I told you, Maya.
The dung got to his head.

628
00:36:39,157 --> 00:36:41,910
- Hi, Bug Hunters.
-Sting Bug!

629
00:36:42,118 --> 00:36:44,704
We're closing in on those
ugly soul-suckers.

630
00:36:44,913 --> 00:36:45,997
Oh,goody.

631
00:36:46,206 --> 00:36:48,124
"Goody?"
There are spiders

632
00:36:48,333 --> 00:36:50,210
and monsters
in this forest, Maya.

633
00:36:50,418 --> 00:36:52,671
Aw! You're not going
to cry, are you?

634
00:36:52,879 --> 00:36:54,756
Anyone would think you
were a bee baby!

635
00:36:54,964 --> 00:36:56,216
Well, er...

636
00:36:56,424 --> 00:36:57,634
Thank you?

637
00:36:58,301 --> 00:36:59,636
Think, Willi.

638
00:36:59,844 --> 00:37:01,096
What is he?

639
00:37:04,933 --> 00:37:09,938
Spiky antennas,
spiky feet, spiky tail.

640
00:37:10,146 --> 00:37:11,272
Just like...

641
00:37:11,481 --> 00:37:12,065
a...

642
00:37:12,774 --> 00:37:14,651
-hornet!
-Where?

643
00:37:14,859 --> 00:37:17,737
Him! There was a picture
just like him in the hive.

644
00:37:17,946 --> 00:37:20,240
But where are
his big red eyes?

645
00:37:20,448 --> 00:37:22,867
And isn't he a bit small?

646
00:37:23,076 --> 00:37:24,369
I'm not small.

647
00:37:24,577 --> 00:37:25,787
Wait a minute.

648
00:37:25,995 --> 00:37:28,248
Hive?
You're bees?

649
00:37:28,456 --> 00:37:31,292
Get back!
Don't suck my soul!

650
00:37:33,712 --> 00:37:36,131
Look!
He's changing colour!

651
00:37:37,507 --> 00:37:41,177
Run, Maya! He's turning
into a spider monster!

652
00:37:41,386 --> 00:37:42,804
A spider what?

653
00:37:44,848 --> 00:37:47,350
Hello, little ones.

654
00:37:47,559 --> 00:37:49,853
- You look lost!
-No, no, no, no!

655
00:37:50,061 --> 00:37:53,231
Care to join me for dinner?

656
00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:55,483
I'm not hungry.

657
00:37:56,568 --> 00:38:00,029
Help! I'm serious!
Help me! Guys?

658
00:38:00,238 --> 00:38:02,240
- We have to save him.
-No, Maya,

659
00:38:02,449 --> 00:38:05,118
- We'll be spider food.
-Not if she can't catch us.

660
00:38:05,326 --> 00:38:09,497
- Hey, what are you doing?
-Four wings are faster than two.

661
00:38:09,706 --> 00:38:11,166
I really need some
help here, guys!

662
00:38:11,374 --> 00:38:13,460
You flap your wings, I'll steer.

663
00:38:13,668 --> 00:38:16,337
- Why do you get to steer?
-Don't leave me!

664
00:38:16,546 --> 00:38:17,630
We're coming!

665
00:38:22,510 --> 00:38:23,887
Grab him!

666
00:38:24,804 --> 00:38:27,390
Don't worry, we'll save you!

667
00:38:38,818 --> 00:38:39,778
Bees!

668
00:38:41,154 --> 00:38:44,532
You follow and you follow
and you don't give up.

669
00:38:44,741 --> 00:38:48,870
And that, my friend, is the key
to being a great tracker.

670
00:38:49,078 --> 00:38:50,830
You know, Barney,
you are so full of--

671
00:38:51,039 --> 00:38:53,792
Shh! I'm definitely
picking up bee vi...

672
00:38:53,958 --> 00:38:57,128
Vibes.
It's pronounced vi...

673
00:38:57,337 --> 00:38:59,047
Vi... Hey!

674
00:38:59,839 --> 00:39:01,883
Hey.

675
00:39:02,091 --> 00:39:03,635
Respect, Brother Sun.

676
00:39:03,843 --> 00:39:07,472
We gratefully
accept your bounty.

677
00:39:07,680 --> 00:39:11,476
- Say hello, my children.
-Hello!

678
00:39:13,853 --> 00:39:15,522
Now, where were we?

679
00:39:17,482 --> 00:39:20,151
Oh, yeah!
Bright lights...

680
00:39:20,360 --> 00:39:24,364
- We were going round and round.
-And round, and round...

681
00:39:33,289 --> 00:39:34,624
That was close.

682
00:39:34,833 --> 00:39:37,085
Next time you
save someone's life,

683
00:39:37,293 --> 00:39:39,671
try not to kill them.

684
00:39:41,297 --> 00:39:43,716
Saved by a
pair of bee-babies...

685
00:39:43,925 --> 00:39:46,386
- What's Dad gonna say?
-"Thank you?"

686
00:39:46,594 --> 00:39:48,137
You don't know my Dad.

687
00:39:48,346 --> 00:39:50,390
And we don't want to.
Leave him, Maya.

688
00:39:50,598 --> 00:39:51,724
No, Willi, wait.

689
00:39:51,933 --> 00:39:53,768
We can't just leave
him here like this.

690
00:39:53,977 --> 00:39:55,103
Maya, we need to find

691
00:39:55,311 --> 00:39:56,813
Jitterbug Hollow
before it gets dark.

692
00:39:57,021 --> 00:40:00,650
Wait, Jitterbug Hollow?
It's near my camp.

693
00:40:00,859 --> 00:40:02,819
- I can take you.
-We don't need your help.

694
00:40:03,027 --> 00:40:04,863
We know exactly
where we're going.

695
00:40:05,071 --> 00:40:06,072
Somewhere that way!

696
00:40:06,281 --> 00:40:10,702
- You mean into Gorgo's land?
-Gorgo?

697
00:40:10,910 --> 00:40:13,621
If you get me out of here
I'll show you the way.

698
00:40:13,830 --> 00:40:15,582
No, Maya.
It's a trap.

699
00:40:15,790 --> 00:40:19,043
But Willi, he knows the way.
And there's a party, remember.

700
00:40:19,252 --> 00:40:21,087
- I bet there's pollen...
-PoHen?

701
00:40:21,296 --> 00:40:22,130
...and buttercups...

702
00:40:22,338 --> 00:40:24,007
- Let's go!
-...and nectar!

703
00:40:24,215 --> 00:40:27,343
Come on, let's go!
What are we waiting for?

704
00:40:27,552 --> 00:40:30,138
What about your dad?
Won't he be worried?

705
00:40:30,346 --> 00:40:31,431
My Dad worried?

706
00:40:32,557 --> 00:40:35,268
He's, like, the
toughest guy ever.

707
00:40:36,728 --> 00:40:39,564
My boy... where is he?

708
00:40:39,772 --> 00:40:41,190
Ah, boss?

709
00:40:41,399 --> 00:40:43,610
- Something in my eye.
-Look!

710
00:40:46,529 --> 00:40:48,573
Turn around, daisy-sniffers!

711
00:40:48,781 --> 00:40:50,491
You're on hornet turf!

712
00:40:50,700 --> 00:40:52,619
Bee turf!
You paper-chewers

713
00:40:52,827 --> 00:40:55,413
have until first light to
leave our meadow.

714
00:40:55,622 --> 00:40:59,042
Oh, really?
Hornets budge for no bug.

715
00:40:59,250 --> 00:41:01,210
What do you
think of that, huh?

716
00:41:02,921 --> 00:41:04,756
You'll see.

717
00:41:04,964 --> 00:41:07,675
Get out of here before
I de-fuzz the lot of you!

718
00:41:07,884 --> 00:41:09,052
You've been warned.

719
00:41:09,260 --> 00:41:11,262
There will be consequences.

720
00:41:12,597 --> 00:41:15,266
Who's afraid of those
striped puff-balls?

721
00:41:15,475 --> 00:41:16,935
Keep looking! Son!

722
00:41:17,143 --> 00:41:18,227
Son!

723
00:41:18,728 --> 00:41:20,146
Son!

724
00:41:34,410 --> 00:41:35,703
I've got it.

725
00:41:37,372 --> 00:41:38,665
Ha-ha!

726
00:41:39,415 --> 00:41:41,459
- Mine!
-No, mine!

727
00:41:41,668 --> 00:41:42,627
Mine...

728
00:41:42,835 --> 00:41:44,504
Gimme, gimme!
I saw it first!

729
00:41:51,761 --> 00:41:53,304
Hornets...

730
00:41:54,013 --> 00:41:55,682
Okay, okay, okay.

731
00:41:55,890 --> 00:41:58,643
Remember our training.
Touch nothing.

732
00:41:58,851 --> 00:42:01,771
Leave everything
exactly as we found--

733
00:42:13,533 --> 00:42:14,283
Oooh...

734
00:42:15,118 --> 00:42:17,036
Maybe they won't notice.

735
00:42:36,973 --> 00:42:39,392
Jitterbug Hollow!

736
00:42:39,600 --> 00:42:41,185
Dragonfly rides!

737
00:42:41,394 --> 00:42:42,937
Dragonfly rides!

738
00:42:43,146 --> 00:42:45,982
Get your dragonfly rides here!

739
00:42:49,193 --> 00:42:50,069
Awesome.

740
00:42:51,154 --> 00:42:53,531
- Want a ride, kid?
-Maybe later.

741
00:42:53,740 --> 00:42:55,241
Anytime.

742
00:42:56,659 --> 00:42:58,619
Well? So where
is this Flip?

743
00:42:58,828 --> 00:42:59,912
It's starting.

744
00:43:08,421 --> 00:43:11,507
- Ladybugs and garden pests!
-Look!

745
00:43:13,176 --> 00:43:16,804
Welcome to Jitterbug Hollow!

746
00:43:17,013 --> 00:43:18,556
Hit it, Mozz!

747
00:43:20,558 --> 00:43:22,727
Let's get some melody!

748
00:43:25,229 --> 00:43:27,648
Now... bugbox!

749
00:43:30,651 --> 00:43:33,905
Let's hear it for the misfits!

750
00:43:34,113 --> 00:43:37,366
What an audience
we've got tonight.

751
00:43:37,575 --> 00:43:39,869
Worms, gnats,
crickets, horseflies.

752
00:43:40,078 --> 00:43:41,162
Why the long faces?

753
00:43:41,370 --> 00:43:43,247
- Any bugs here from out of town?
-Me, Flip!

754
00:43:43,456 --> 00:43:45,833
- Hey, Flip, it's me!
-Welcome, little one.

755
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:48,377
- Did they give you a name yet?
-Maya.

756
00:43:48,586 --> 00:43:51,047
Maya? I like it.

757
00:43:51,255 --> 00:43:54,175
What brings you
to Jitterbug Hollow, Maya?

758
00:43:54,383 --> 00:43:58,304
Well, you said if I ever had a
question I should come to you.

759
00:43:58,513 --> 00:44:01,724
Ask away.
We're all friends here.

760
00:44:03,392 --> 00:44:05,186
Where do I belong, Flip?

761
00:44:06,104 --> 00:44:08,147
Oh, an easy one.

762
00:44:08,356 --> 00:44:11,859
Last I checked, bees
belonged in hives, Maya.

763
00:44:12,068 --> 00:44:15,530
They don't like me back there.
I'm just too different.

764
00:44:15,738 --> 00:44:18,783
Please, Flip, you need to
teach me how to live out here.

765
00:44:18,991 --> 00:44:20,243
In the meadow.

766
00:44:20,451 --> 00:44:22,203
Here. Hold this.

767
00:44:22,411 --> 00:44:26,332
Maya, the answers
you seek are in here.

768
00:44:26,541 --> 00:44:28,626
Step inside the magic flower

769
00:44:28,835 --> 00:44:30,378
and be transformed

770
00:44:30,586 --> 00:44:34,340
into the bug that
everyone loves!

771
00:44:34,549 --> 00:44:37,176
Behold the mysteries
of the meadow

772
00:44:37,385 --> 00:44:39,971
as I transform Maya.

773
00:44:40,179 --> 00:44:42,348
You say ci-cay-da,
I say ci-cah-da...

774
00:44:43,808 --> 00:44:47,103
Well, little buzzer,
how do you feel?

775
00:44:47,311 --> 00:44:50,022
Huh? Hey!
I'm still the same.

776
00:44:50,231 --> 00:44:51,524
Exactly.

777
00:44:51,732 --> 00:44:53,401
You don't need my help.

778
00:44:53,609 --> 00:44:55,528
- Huh?
-Just be yourself

779
00:44:55,736 --> 00:44:58,114
and you'll make it anywhere.

780
00:44:58,322 --> 00:45:01,617
Let's make this little buzzer
feel welcome.

781
00:45:04,787 --> 00:45:06,581
The grass is always greener

782
00:45:06,789 --> 00:45:09,041
in some other insect's yard.

783
00:45:09,250 --> 00:45:11,502
Just look across
the big fence now

784
00:45:11,711 --> 00:45:13,379
You'll see it's not so hard!

785
00:45:13,588 --> 00:45:14,797
It's not so hard!

786
00:45:15,006 --> 00:45:17,091
It's easy to let those big bees

787
00:45:17,300 --> 00:45:19,468
make you feel
a little bit small.

788
00:45:19,677 --> 00:45:21,721
Just keep you head
held high now.

789
00:45:21,929 --> 00:45:24,974
Now don't you feel...
taller than tall?

790
00:45:29,729 --> 00:45:33,649
- It don't matter what they say!
-It don't matter!

791
00:45:33,858 --> 00:45:38,529
Find that rhythm in your heart!
Just bee yourself every day!

792
00:45:38,738 --> 00:45:40,948
Shake your bee-hind all about!

793
00:45:41,157 --> 00:45:43,159
Shake-shake... Shake it out...

794
00:45:43,367 --> 00:45:47,747
Shout it out!
And bee yourself every day!

795
00:45:50,666 --> 00:45:52,960
Ask your new friends
around you!

796
00:45:53,169 --> 00:45:55,296
they flew from near and far!

797
00:45:55,504 --> 00:45:57,590
We come from the
same bug family!

798
00:45:57,798 --> 00:45:59,967
And we love you
the way you are!

799
00:46:00,176 --> 00:46:02,470
Life's all about the
bugs who love you!

800
00:46:02,678 --> 00:46:04,889
Good friends can
be hard to find...

801
00:46:05,097 --> 00:46:07,308
Red beetle, blue beetle!
Big smelly dung beetle!

802
00:46:07,516 --> 00:46:10,102
It don't matter what
their kind!

803
00:46:10,311 --> 00:46:12,063
It don't matter what
they say!

804
00:46:13,773 --> 00:46:18,778
Find that rhythm in your heart!
Just bee yourself every day!

805
00:46:18,986 --> 00:46:22,949
- Shake your bee-hind all about.
-Shake, shake! Shake it out!

806
00:46:23,157 --> 00:46:28,704
Say it loud, shout it out,
and bee yourself every day!

807
00:46:28,913 --> 00:46:32,458
Remember, Maya:
What goes in must come out.

808
00:46:32,667 --> 00:46:33,960
"Laaaa!"

809
00:46:34,919 --> 00:46:37,129
"Laaaa!"

810
00:46:37,338 --> 00:46:39,090
I wanna sing songs.

811
00:46:39,298 --> 00:46:41,467
I want to be free.

812
00:46:41,676 --> 00:46:43,803
I wanna be me.

813
00:46:44,011 --> 00:46:47,723
- I'm Maya the Bee-eel
-Maya!

814
00:46:53,271 --> 00:46:55,731
I am Maya the Bee!

815
00:46:56,983 --> 00:46:58,567
You're a star, Maya.

816
00:46:58,776 --> 00:47:02,530
C'mon. I'll show you
how to move your bee-hind.

817
00:47:02,738 --> 00:47:04,198
You. Me. Dancefloor.

818
00:47:08,995 --> 00:47:11,038
Sing out loud!
Shout it out!

819
00:47:11,247 --> 00:47:13,082
- And bee yourself!
- Son!

820
00:47:21,632 --> 00:47:22,591
Yeah!

821
00:47:25,094 --> 00:47:27,555
Away from that bee! Now!

822
00:47:28,472 --> 00:47:30,516
What has she done to you?

823
00:47:30,725 --> 00:47:32,435
My Buzzywump is the
bee-hatingest

824
00:47:32,643 --> 00:47:33,978
hornet in the meadow.

825
00:47:34,186 --> 00:47:37,732
Undo your evil hive magic.
I'm warning you.

826
00:47:40,359 --> 00:47:43,904
Your name is "Buzzywump"?

827
00:47:44,113 --> 00:47:45,364
It's a good name.

828
00:47:46,115 --> 00:47:48,242
Dad, I can explain.

829
00:47:48,451 --> 00:47:50,119
She and him...

830
00:47:50,328 --> 00:47:53,247
They kinda sorta...
saved my life.

831
00:47:53,456 --> 00:47:55,791
But it's not like we're
friends or anything.

832
00:47:59,670 --> 00:48:02,506
I'm sensing a lot of tension
here. You're all bugged out.

833
00:48:02,715 --> 00:48:05,217
Done to pieces.
Are you eating properly?

834
00:48:05,426 --> 00:48:09,555
Come on, Hank,
she saved your boy.

835
00:48:09,764 --> 00:48:12,850
This happy hopper just saved
you a stinging, bee-nut!

836
00:48:13,059 --> 00:48:16,020
But keep away from my son.

837
00:48:16,228 --> 00:48:18,064
Oh, boy,
you are so grounded.

838
00:48:18,272 --> 00:48:20,441
Any more grounded
and you'd be a worm.

839
00:48:24,153 --> 00:48:25,488
It's okay.

840
00:48:25,696 --> 00:48:28,532
He's just a mixed-up
little bug like you were.

841
00:48:28,741 --> 00:48:30,201
He'll learn.

842
00:48:30,409 --> 00:48:32,036
I hope so.

843
00:48:36,874 --> 00:48:39,043
- Royal Adviser?
-Yes?

844
00:48:40,252 --> 00:48:42,380
I mean, come in!
Did you...

845
00:48:42,588 --> 00:48:46,258
-give the hornets my message?
-They won't leave the meadow...

846
00:48:46,467 --> 00:48:48,427
- Ma'am.
-ExceHenL

847
00:48:49,887 --> 00:48:51,680
Dismissed, sergeant.

848
00:48:55,976 --> 00:48:57,103
Crawley?

849
00:48:57,311 --> 00:49:00,689
Yes, Your Sneakiness?
I mean Your Schemingness.

850
00:49:00,898 --> 00:49:02,525
It's time.

851
00:49:02,733 --> 00:49:06,112
You brought this on
yourself, old buzzer.

852
00:49:06,320 --> 00:49:08,739
I wish there were another way.
We need...

853
00:49:08,948 --> 00:49:11,325
a strong leader.
And you are just...

854
00:49:11,534 --> 00:49:13,786
too weak.

855
00:49:13,994 --> 00:49:17,957
Crawley? Are you thinking
what I'm thinking?

856
00:49:18,165 --> 00:49:20,668
It depends on what you're
thinking, Your Thinkyness.

857
00:49:27,174 --> 00:49:29,176
Your Majesty!

858
00:49:47,319 --> 00:49:50,614
Nice legwork, Mr. Centipede.
See you next time.

859
00:49:50,823 --> 00:49:53,492
Alright, you flies.
No more eating vomit.

860
00:49:53,701 --> 00:49:55,828
Oh, there you are.
Come on.

861
00:49:56,036 --> 00:49:58,372
Flip is ready to take us home.

862
00:49:58,581 --> 00:49:59,748
I am home, Willi.

863
00:50:01,041 --> 00:50:05,671
- Here? In the meadow?
-This is where I belong.

864
00:50:05,880 --> 00:50:09,258
With stink bugs and
smelly, stinky hornets?

865
00:50:09,467 --> 00:50:11,927
No. With all bugs.

866
00:50:12,136 --> 00:50:14,472
With all bugs
except me, huh?

867
00:50:14,680 --> 00:50:17,183
Don't be cross.
I'll visit you.

868
00:50:17,391 --> 00:50:19,894
Why would you visit
boring old Willi

869
00:50:20,102 --> 00:50:23,189
in his boring old hive
when you've got all this?

870
00:50:23,397 --> 00:50:26,484
I put my stinger
on the line for you.

871
00:50:26,692 --> 00:50:30,446
- And this is how you thank me?
-But, Willi...

872
00:50:30,654 --> 00:50:33,616
With all your new bug friends
I guess you won't need

873
00:50:33,824 --> 00:50:35,743
poor old Willi anymore.

874
00:50:35,951 --> 00:50:37,286
Don't be silly.

875
00:50:37,495 --> 00:50:38,913
Stay with me.

876
00:50:39,121 --> 00:50:40,831
There's an old bee saying:

877
00:50:41,040 --> 00:50:43,250
"You can always
count on a friend."

878
00:50:43,459 --> 00:50:45,753
But I guess I got that
one wrong, too.

879
00:50:45,961 --> 00:50:48,589
Willi!
Willi!

880
00:51:04,730 --> 00:51:08,108
Son, I know you think
you like that bee,

881
00:51:08,317 --> 00:51:09,777
but she's
twisted your thoughts.

882
00:51:09,985 --> 00:51:11,362
Dad, not all bees are--

883
00:51:11,570 --> 00:51:14,573
Shh. It's quiet.
Too quiet.

884
00:51:23,666 --> 00:51:25,918
By my pointy pincers!

885
00:51:27,127 --> 00:51:30,047
Pollen...
This is bee work.

886
00:51:30,256 --> 00:51:33,926
Those sneaky wax-nibblers
set us up.

887
00:51:34,134 --> 00:51:36,220
Didn't I say you
can't trust bees?

888
00:51:36,428 --> 00:51:37,263
But Dad...

889
00:51:37,471 --> 00:51:38,973
Assemble the Five Tribes!

890
00:51:39,181 --> 00:51:41,684
If those fur-balls
want to play rough,

891
00:51:41,892 --> 00:51:44,353
they picked on the
wrong hornets!

892
00:51:46,063 --> 00:51:47,398
Oh, no.

893
00:51:51,235 --> 00:51:55,155
Whoa. If this is Jitterbug
Hollow, I'm a flea.

894
00:51:55,364 --> 00:51:56,907
We're lost, Antstein.

895
00:51:57,116 --> 00:51:58,284
You're lost, bug-brain.

896
00:51:58,492 --> 00:52:00,995
My feelers know exactly
where we are.

897
00:52:05,207 --> 00:52:06,792
Oh, yeah? Where?

898
00:52:07,001 --> 00:52:08,836
Wait, wait, wait. Wait.

899
00:52:09,044 --> 00:52:12,214
I'm getting something.
Bee vibes.

900
00:52:12,423 --> 00:52:15,092
- Excuse us, fellas.
-Everybody, shh!

901
00:52:15,301 --> 00:52:18,304
Yep, yep. Definitely a bee
around here somewhere.

902
00:52:18,512 --> 00:52:20,097
Is it Willi?

903
00:52:20,306 --> 00:52:22,349
- We're looking for a bee, too.
-That's great, kid,

904
00:52:22,558 --> 00:52:23,726
A little shush, please.

905
00:52:23,934 --> 00:52:25,227
Genius at work!

906
00:52:25,436 --> 00:52:27,521
Arnie, hey, Arnie, look.

907
00:52:27,730 --> 00:52:30,899
Fuzzy, stripy,
boogly eyes and bobbly head!

908
00:52:31,108 --> 00:52:33,152
- A tigerfly!
-No, a bee.

909
00:52:33,360 --> 00:52:34,778
- Oh, a bee!
-A bee!

910
00:52:34,987 --> 00:52:38,073
And Flip! Hey, Arnie, didn't I
say we were on the right track?

911
00:52:38,282 --> 00:52:39,825
- Where've you been, naughty bee?

912
00:52:40,034 --> 00:52:41,744
Miss Cassandra's got enough
worries without you

913
00:52:41,952 --> 00:52:43,037
buzzing off into the meadow.

914
00:52:43,245 --> 00:52:44,622
Hey, don't you know
the Queen's sick?

915
00:52:44,830 --> 00:52:47,249
The hornets stole
her royal jelly.

916
00:52:55,466 --> 00:52:58,677
It was the Adviser.
I saw her with the royal jelly.

917
00:52:58,886 --> 00:53:01,096
Flip, we need to
get back to the hive.

918
00:53:01,305 --> 00:53:03,849
- Willi!
-Good work, boys.

919
00:53:04,058 --> 00:53:05,100
Hee-hop!

920
00:53:06,810 --> 00:53:10,522
- Willi!
-Willi! Where are you?

921
00:53:10,731 --> 00:53:12,733
Willi!

922
00:53:15,611 --> 00:53:17,863
"I am home, Willi.

923
00:53:18,072 --> 00:53:20,532
"Here at Jitterbug Hollow
I'm so happy."

924
00:53:20,741 --> 00:53:25,204
Fine, be like that. I'll go home
too, and I'll feel happy.

925
00:53:25,412 --> 00:53:29,458
Back to your pond, froggy.
I'm not in the mood.

926
00:53:29,667 --> 00:53:33,879
- We've got pollen!
-Oh, pollen.

927
00:53:34,088 --> 00:53:37,466
No.
No, Willi. Stay strong.

928
00:53:37,675 --> 00:53:40,010
But you'll be
stronger with pollen.

929
00:53:41,512 --> 00:53:42,763
NQI NQ ' ' “C! "Q ' no: "Q

930
00:53:42,971 --> 00:53:44,682
Walk on, Willi. Walk on.

931
00:53:44,890 --> 00:53:46,350
Okay, you win.

932
00:53:46,558 --> 00:53:48,268
Gimme gimme gimme
gimme pollen!

933
00:53:52,815 --> 00:53:55,192
Willi?
Willi, come back.

934
00:53:55,401 --> 00:53:57,653
He's caught in an updraft!

935
00:53:57,861 --> 00:53:59,863
Those are big flutter bugs.

936
00:54:00,072 --> 00:54:01,490
They're not flutter bugs,

937
00:54:01,699 --> 00:54:03,242
they're bats!

938
00:54:05,786 --> 00:54:10,457
We have to do something!
When I count to three, kick!

939
00:54:10,666 --> 00:54:11,875
One, two, three.

940
00:54:12,084 --> 00:54:13,001
Hee-hop!

941
00:54:18,924 --> 00:54:20,801
Nice birdy.

942
00:54:21,009 --> 00:54:23,011
Hold on, Willi,
I'm coming!

943
00:54:30,644 --> 00:54:33,439
I'm coming, kids! Hee-hop!

944
00:54:35,941 --> 00:54:37,943
Hey, ugly!
Over here!

945
00:54:43,574 --> 00:54:45,951
Maya!
Hold on, kids!

946
00:55:17,983 --> 00:55:19,943
You kids okay?

947
00:55:22,279 --> 00:55:23,655
Willi!

948
00:55:25,491 --> 00:55:26,909
Willi?

949
00:55:27,993 --> 00:55:29,244
No, no.

950
00:55:29,453 --> 00:55:30,996
Please wake up.

951
00:55:35,209 --> 00:55:37,503
You said you had pollen.

952
00:55:37,711 --> 00:55:38,962
Oh, Willi.

953
00:55:40,130 --> 00:55:43,425
I am so sorry.
Are you still my friend?

954
00:55:43,634 --> 00:55:46,887
Of course. You must never
let a friend go, Maya.

955
00:55:47,095 --> 00:55:50,849
Especially your
best and only friend.

956
00:55:53,143 --> 00:55:55,979
- Where are we?
-Shh. Gorgo's hedge.

957
00:55:56,188 --> 00:55:58,190
Gorgo's hedge?

958
00:55:58,398 --> 00:56:01,360
- Which way is the hive, Flip?
-We're going back to the hive?

959
00:56:01,568 --> 00:56:03,946
Straight through Gorgo's land.
No, no, no!

960
00:56:04,154 --> 00:56:06,240
Maya, go all
the way around.

961
00:56:06,448 --> 00:56:08,033
- Yeah, listen to him!
-There's no time!

962
00:56:08,242 --> 00:56:09,493
This is the quickest way.

963
00:56:09,701 --> 00:56:11,453
I'm confused.
What's going on?

964
00:56:11,662 --> 00:56:13,956
The Queen needs us, Willi.
I'll tell you on the way.

965
00:56:14,164 --> 00:56:17,167
She's got more spark then a
barrel full of lightning bugs.

966
00:56:17,376 --> 00:56:18,293
Hee-hop!

967
00:56:20,295 --> 00:56:22,798
We're gonna get eaten,
I know it.

968
00:56:30,264 --> 00:56:31,640
Royal bees!

969
00:56:31,849 --> 00:56:33,767
I regret to inform you

970
00:56:33,976 --> 00:56:35,561
that after a long
battle with illness

971
00:56:35,769 --> 00:56:37,437
our beloved Queen

972
00:56:37,646 --> 00:56:40,190
is not quite one
hundred percent.

973
00:56:40,399 --> 00:56:43,360
That is to say, well,
she has buzzed off

974
00:56:43,569 --> 00:56:45,779
to the big hive in the sky.

975
00:56:46,655 --> 00:56:49,116
She has passed away.

976
00:56:51,034 --> 00:56:53,996
But every hive
needs a strong leader.

977
00:56:54,204 --> 00:56:56,039
And that is why I,

978
00:56:56,248 --> 00:56:58,125
your new hive master,

979
00:56:58,333 --> 00:57:01,461
am honored
to announce our new Queen.

980
00:57:01,670 --> 00:57:03,380
Buzzlina,

981
00:57:03,589 --> 00:57:06,633
the Conqueror!

982
00:57:11,346 --> 00:57:14,975
- Is it true?
-My dear bees,

983
00:57:15,183 --> 00:57:19,980
let us pause to remember
our beloved leader.

984
00:57:20,188 --> 00:57:25,235
We all know who is responsible
for this grave injustice:

985
00:57:25,444 --> 00:57:27,779
The filthy hornets.

986
00:57:27,988 --> 00:57:32,951
First our poor gentle Queen,
and next our hive.

987
00:57:33,160 --> 00:57:36,038
Are we going to let them
get away with it?

988
00:57:36,246 --> 00:57:38,415
- No!
-At first light,

989
00:57:38,624 --> 00:57:43,629
we'll run those horrid
buzz-boxes out of our meadow.

990
00:57:43,837 --> 00:57:46,173
This is for the Queen!

991
00:57:46,381 --> 00:57:47,549
Oh, no.

992
00:57:47,758 --> 00:57:50,302
Maya and Willi are out there.

993
00:57:55,807 --> 00:57:57,851
That's Gorgo's belly.

994
00:57:58,060 --> 00:58:00,228
He's hungry, Maya.
We should turn back.

995
00:58:00,437 --> 00:58:02,481
Come on, Willi.

996
00:58:02,689 --> 00:58:04,066
Wait for us, Maya.

997
00:58:04,274 --> 00:58:05,859
Don't go too far ahead.

998
00:58:12,157 --> 00:58:14,785
- Gorgo's got Maya!
-Maya? Come on!

999
00:58:19,081 --> 00:58:20,499
Gorgo wants to eat us!

1000
00:58:20,707 --> 00:58:22,417
- Get off, greedy guts.
-Hey!

1001
00:58:22,626 --> 00:58:25,796
- Over here!
-Maya...

1002
00:58:26,004 --> 00:58:28,298
Gorgo is going to
be really, really cross.

1003
00:58:28,507 --> 00:58:30,676
You should never, ever
land on a monster.

1004
00:58:30,884 --> 00:58:32,552
It's just common sense.

1005
00:58:32,761 --> 00:58:34,596
Gorgo's not a monster, Willi.

1006
00:58:34,805 --> 00:58:36,139
She's right.

1007
00:58:36,348 --> 00:58:39,351
This is what everybody's
so scared of?

1008
00:58:39,559 --> 00:58:41,770
He's made out of grass.

1009
00:58:41,979 --> 00:58:45,399
A grass monster?
They're the worst.

1010
00:58:48,026 --> 00:58:50,153
Hold on!

1011
00:58:51,989 --> 00:58:53,156
Willi!

1012
00:58:55,283 --> 00:58:56,243
Maya!

1013
00:58:57,619 --> 00:58:58,745
Maya!

1014
00:59:06,795 --> 00:59:07,796
Maya!

1015
00:59:09,297 --> 00:59:10,924
A baby Gorgo!

1016
00:59:11,133 --> 00:59:14,219
Enough is enough.
Payback time.

1017
00:59:19,391 --> 00:59:20,559
Willi...

1018
00:59:20,767 --> 00:59:22,811
- What are you doing?
-Maya?

1019
00:59:23,020 --> 00:59:25,188
Kids!
Are you okay?

1020
00:59:25,397 --> 00:59:28,942
- Kind of.
-I tip my hat to you, Maya.

1021
00:59:29,151 --> 00:59:31,945
You taught this old bug
something new.

1022
00:59:32,154 --> 00:59:36,450
Come on, before
poor old Gorgo falls on us!

1023
00:59:42,622 --> 00:59:44,541
I am a dirty bee monster.

1024
00:59:44,750 --> 00:59:47,502
- I've come to suck your soul.
-Stop that.

1025
00:59:47,711 --> 00:59:48,962
Bees don't suck souls.

1026
00:59:49,171 --> 00:59:51,339
Some of them are
even kind of nice.

1027
00:59:51,548 --> 00:59:53,300
Sting's a bee-lover.

1028
00:59:58,930 --> 01:00:01,433
The Five Tribes!

1029
01:00:02,434 --> 01:00:03,977
Welcome, my brothers!

1030
01:00:04,186 --> 01:00:06,104
Eat, dance and be feral.

1031
01:00:06,313 --> 01:00:08,607
Because at first light tomorrow

1032
01:00:08,815 --> 01:00:13,737
we'll gonna squash those pollen
guzzlers once and for all!

1033
01:00:16,364 --> 01:00:18,617
Oh, no. Maya!

1034
01:00:32,089 --> 01:00:34,508
Halt! Bees only!

1035
01:00:34,716 --> 01:00:36,426
But we have to
speak to the Queen.

1036
01:00:36,635 --> 01:00:38,428
How do we know
you're not a hornet spy?

1037
01:00:38,637 --> 01:00:42,265
How do we know you're not a
frog in fluffy pyjamas?

1038
01:00:42,474 --> 01:00:44,476
- Tough crowd.
-Sorry,

1039
01:00:44,684 --> 01:00:46,520
- Queen's orders.
-Flip!

1040
01:00:46,728 --> 01:00:49,481
You go, Maya.
I'll be right out here.

1041
01:00:52,150 --> 01:00:54,611
All gather in the great hall.

1042
01:00:58,156 --> 01:00:59,324
Ahh!

1043
01:00:59,533 --> 01:01:02,119
- Oh! Hey!
-Out of the way!

1044
01:01:02,327 --> 01:01:04,871
I don't think I like
this hive anymore.

1045
01:01:09,126 --> 01:01:11,211
How do we get past
the queen's guards?

1046
01:01:11,419 --> 01:01:14,214
Don't worry, Maya.
I got this.

1047
01:01:14,422 --> 01:01:17,843
Hey, you guys,
check this out.

1048
01:01:18,051 --> 01:01:19,052
Willi...

1049
01:01:30,856 --> 01:01:32,315
Nice moves.

1050
01:01:32,524 --> 01:01:34,151
Heh,bye.

1051
01:01:38,071 --> 01:01:40,282
Your Majesty,
You're better.

1052
01:01:42,784 --> 01:01:43,910
See?

1053
01:01:44,119 --> 01:01:44,953
But...

1054
01:01:45,162 --> 01:01:46,538
But it's not possible.

1055
01:01:46,746 --> 01:01:48,665
Why's the golden hat
on your head?

1056
01:01:48,874 --> 01:01:49,749
Where is the Queen?

1057
01:01:50,876 --> 01:01:52,669
You're looking at her.
Guards!

1058
01:01:52,878 --> 01:01:55,463
- What have you done?
-Coming, Your Highness!

1059
01:01:55,672 --> 01:01:57,048
Hot honey cakes.

1060
01:01:58,008 --> 01:01:59,259
Just the way
you like them.

1061
01:02:00,719 --> 01:02:02,929
Maya, you're alive! That's...

1062
01:02:04,139 --> 01:02:05,932
very, very
serious indeed.

1063
01:02:06,141 --> 01:02:08,977
Don't you know?
Our dear Queen...

1064
01:02:09,186 --> 01:02:11,021
-has passed away.
-No!

1065
01:02:11,229 --> 01:02:14,024
Don't you worry, 396.

1066
01:02:14,232 --> 01:02:17,319
We'll have our revenge
on those ghastly hornets.

1067
01:02:17,527 --> 01:02:21,448
Liar! You stole the royal jelly
from the queen and hid it.

1068
01:02:24,701 --> 01:02:27,621
It's true, I'm guilty.

1069
01:02:29,372 --> 01:02:31,875
Guilty of caring too much:

1070
01:02:32,083 --> 01:02:33,752
Against my better judgment

1071
01:02:33,960 --> 01:02:37,881
I let this mixed-up little bee
go into the meadow alone.

1072
01:02:38,089 --> 01:02:41,301
Poor child, she's not
in her right mind.

1073
01:02:41,509 --> 01:02:44,137
Wait! She's lying.
You have to believe me.

1074
01:02:44,346 --> 01:02:47,015
I know where she
hid the royal jelly.

1075
01:02:47,224 --> 01:02:50,143
Well, if you're so sure,
why don't you show us

1076
01:02:50,352 --> 01:02:51,645
where it is?

1077
01:02:53,855 --> 01:02:56,441
This is it, in here.

1078
01:02:57,525 --> 01:03:00,278
Poor little bee's
got meadow fever.

1079
01:03:00,487 --> 01:03:03,365
Now everyone can see
what a liar you are.

1080
01:03:07,202 --> 01:03:08,703
Huh? But where is it?

1081
01:03:08,912 --> 01:03:11,581
- Lock her up.
-No, let go.

1082
01:03:11,790 --> 01:03:15,418
- She's lying.
-it's for your own good, 396.

1083
01:03:15,627 --> 01:03:20,465
Now if you'll excuse me,
I've got some hornets to crush.

1084
01:03:20,674 --> 01:03:23,093
- I promise, she took it!
-This way.

1085
01:03:23,301 --> 01:03:25,345
No, let go.
She's lying.

1086
01:03:25,553 --> 01:03:26,304
No!

1087
01:03:27,764 --> 01:03:31,559
No, the hornets didn't do it!
Please believe me.

1088
01:03:31,768 --> 01:03:33,937
I told you she was a liar.

1089
01:03:35,814 --> 01:03:37,232
Give me that!

1090
01:03:55,292 --> 01:03:57,168
Your Majesty!

1091
01:03:59,504 --> 01:04:01,047
Coming.

1092
01:04:06,011 --> 01:04:07,512
- Willi.
-Maya.

1093
01:04:07,721 --> 01:04:08,638
Willi, Willi!

1094
01:04:09,973 --> 01:04:12,851
I'll have you out of there
in two wingbeats.

1095
01:04:14,978 --> 01:04:16,521
Make that
three wingbeats.

1096
01:04:17,731 --> 01:04:19,691
- You're not supposed to be here!
-Willi!

1097
01:04:19,899 --> 01:04:23,445
What are you doing here?
Stop!

1098
01:04:23,653 --> 01:04:24,904
Stop!

1099
01:04:26,948 --> 01:04:29,200
Stop!
Come back!

1100
01:04:32,287 --> 01:04:33,955
Grab him!

1101
01:04:35,957 --> 01:04:36,958
Traitor!

1102
01:04:37,167 --> 01:04:39,669
- Stop that tubby dunce.
-Stop!

1103
01:04:44,382 --> 01:04:46,551
Left, right, left, right...

1104
01:04:58,146 --> 01:05:01,900
This is a waste of time.
We have bugs to crush.

1105
01:05:13,036 --> 01:05:14,704
Fall in, soldier.

1106
01:05:21,753 --> 01:05:23,671
- Willi...
-Keep moving!

1107
01:05:25,673 --> 01:05:27,384
Keep formation!

1108
01:05:28,218 --> 01:05:31,388
Willi!
Don't go away.

1109
01:05:34,599 --> 01:05:36,768
Don't leave me.

1110
01:06:06,297 --> 01:06:08,216
Flip! Flip!

1111
01:06:16,808 --> 01:06:19,519
- Get off me, bug!
-Flip, help!

1112
01:06:19,727 --> 01:06:21,521
Wait, is that Willi!

1113
01:06:21,729 --> 01:06:23,314
Stink Bug?

1114
01:06:24,566 --> 01:06:26,025
You have to warn your Queen.

1115
01:06:26,234 --> 01:06:28,027
Dad's making an
ambush on the hive.

1116
01:06:28,236 --> 01:06:31,322
But the bees are making
an ambush on you hornets.

1117
01:06:31,531 --> 01:06:33,199
Flip!

1118
01:06:41,332 --> 01:06:42,292
Hello?

1119
01:06:43,585 --> 01:06:44,669
Who's there?

1120
01:06:45,587 --> 01:06:48,089
Miss Queen?
Miss Queen.

1121
01:06:48,298 --> 01:06:49,924
You're alive.
Your Majesty.

1122
01:06:50,133 --> 01:06:52,177
- It's me, Maya.
-Maya?

1123
01:06:53,470 --> 01:06:56,264
It's okay, I'm going
to get us out of here.

1124
01:07:01,978 --> 01:07:06,274
No, no, no, stay with me.
Please.

1125
01:07:06,483 --> 01:07:08,151
I'm sorry, Miss Queen.

1126
01:07:08,359 --> 01:07:09,986
It's my fault.

1127
01:07:10,195 --> 01:07:14,782
I just wanted to see
the outside world.

1128
01:07:14,991 --> 01:07:18,036
If I had stayed in the hive
like a good bee,

1129
01:07:18,244 --> 01:07:21,331
I could have
stopped the Adviser.

1130
01:07:22,999 --> 01:07:26,002
It's not your fault, Maya.

1131
01:07:26,920 --> 01:07:29,547
You followed your heart.

1132
01:07:29,756 --> 01:07:31,466
That takes courage.

1133
01:07:32,634 --> 01:07:34,010
You stay...

1134
01:07:34,219 --> 01:07:36,346
just the way you are,

1135
01:07:37,514 --> 01:07:39,474
'Maya...
"No!

1136
01:07:39,682 --> 01:07:42,060
No. Wake up.

1137
01:07:44,479 --> 01:07:47,899
- Maya.
-Willi! You came back.

1138
01:07:49,275 --> 01:07:50,693
And Sting.

1139
01:07:51,778 --> 01:07:53,613
I'm sorry about what I said.

1140
01:07:53,821 --> 01:07:54,781
I didn't mean it.

1141
01:07:54,989 --> 01:07:57,033
You're the best
friend a hornet

1142
01:07:57,242 --> 01:07:59,077
-could have.
-Maya...

1143
01:07:59,285 --> 01:08:01,621
Thank sweet nectar you're safe!

1144
01:08:01,829 --> 01:08:03,331
How did you know I was here?

1145
01:08:03,540 --> 01:08:05,166
A charming grasshopper,

1146
01:08:05,375 --> 01:08:06,960
a fiery hornet

1147
01:08:07,168 --> 01:08:11,673
and a brave little bee snuck in
and told me everything.

1148
01:08:11,881 --> 01:08:13,216
Your Majesty...

1149
01:08:13,424 --> 01:08:14,676
Stay with us.

1150
01:08:15,552 --> 01:08:17,053
She's fading fast.

1151
01:08:17,262 --> 01:08:20,223
- She needs the royal jelly.
-The Royal Adviser took it.

1152
01:08:20,431 --> 01:08:22,517
How are we going to
get it back from her?

1153
01:08:22,725 --> 01:08:23,935
It's not gonna be easy.

1154
01:08:24,143 --> 01:08:26,604
All the hornet tribes are going
up against the bees.

1155
01:08:26,813 --> 01:08:28,273
Take me to them.

1156
01:08:28,481 --> 01:08:32,026
Only I can stop this.

1157
01:08:32,235 --> 01:08:34,237
- We could carry her.
-Too slow.

1158
01:08:34,445 --> 01:08:36,739
We'll never catch
the bees in time.

1159
01:08:36,948 --> 01:08:37,865
I'll do it.

1160
01:08:38,074 --> 01:08:40,159
I'll go ahead and
get the royal jelly.

1161
01:08:40,368 --> 01:08:42,912
- You follow me with the Queen.
-No, Maya.

1162
01:08:43,121 --> 01:08:46,207
It's too dangerous.
You're just one little bee.

1163
01:08:46,416 --> 01:08:49,377
- Two little bees.
-And a hornet.

1164
01:08:49,586 --> 01:08:52,088
And a whole meadow
full of friends.

1165
01:08:52,297 --> 01:08:55,258
If anyone can do it, she can.

1166
01:08:55,466 --> 01:08:57,510
You really keep
surprising me.

1167
01:08:57,719 --> 01:09:00,138
I'm so proud of you, Maya.

1168
01:09:00,346 --> 01:09:01,306
Be careful.

1169
01:09:02,515 --> 01:09:05,935
Let's go, Bug Hunters!
Danger calls!

1170
01:09:40,345 --> 01:09:41,888
We're flying ants!

1171
01:09:45,600 --> 01:09:48,645
There they are!
There's still time. Come on.

1172
01:09:57,403 --> 01:09:59,614
Oh, no.
It's Dad.

1173
01:10:10,833 --> 01:10:12,126
How cute.

1174
01:10:12,335 --> 01:10:15,338
Little pollen pinchers
all in a row.

1175
01:10:17,799 --> 01:10:19,926
Prepare to attack, bees.

1176
01:10:21,761 --> 01:10:25,723
It'll take a miracle
to stop them now.

1177
01:10:29,060 --> 01:10:31,854
- Or a Gorgo.
-Gorgo?

1178
01:10:32,063 --> 01:10:35,400
Come on. You need to trust me.

1179
01:10:35,608 --> 01:10:38,069
Come on, guys!
What are you waiting for?

1180
01:10:42,532 --> 01:10:43,866
My dear bees,

1181
01:10:44,075 --> 01:10:47,161
remember our
dear departed Queen.

1182
01:10:47,370 --> 01:10:49,414
This is for her.

1183
01:10:49,622 --> 01:10:52,834
Today we make bee-story.

1184
01:10:53,042 --> 01:10:54,836
Enough fancy talk.

1185
01:10:55,044 --> 01:10:57,171
Spitball those syrup-suckers!

1186
01:11:02,135 --> 01:11:05,054
- Crawley... attack!
-Attack. Right.

1187
01:11:05,263 --> 01:11:07,682
First row, prepare buckets!

1188
01:11:07,890 --> 01:11:11,060
- I said attack, wax-brain!
-Oh, okay.

1189
01:11:11,269 --> 01:11:13,813
- Attack!
-But, Buzzlina...

1190
01:11:14,021 --> 01:11:17,692
- Do it now, you fool!
-Release the honey!

1191
01:11:17,900 --> 01:11:19,277
I said now!

1192
01:11:23,740 --> 01:11:26,826
Not on us, honey-heads!
The hornets!

1193
01:11:27,034 --> 01:11:28,703
Drop it on the hornets!

1194
01:11:30,413 --> 01:11:32,081
Charge!

1195
01:11:40,590 --> 01:11:41,924
Missed me!

1196
01:11:46,679 --> 01:11:50,183
- Get off, you fuzzy-buzzer!
-You get off,

1197
01:11:50,391 --> 01:11:52,977
you overgrown gnat!
Crawley!

1198
01:11:54,854 --> 01:11:57,565
Missed me! Too slow!
Who wants a piece of Crawley?

1199
01:12:09,577 --> 01:12:11,037
Gorgo.

1200
01:12:11,245 --> 01:12:16,209
Who wakes Gorgo
from his sleep?

1201
01:12:19,754 --> 01:12:24,592
All this fighting
makes Gorgo hungry.

1202
01:12:28,638 --> 01:12:31,474
- Right! Go right!
-Left!

1203
01:12:31,682 --> 01:12:34,352
No, I said the other left!

1204
01:12:34,560 --> 01:12:39,524
Naughty bugs, the meadow
belongs to everyone!

1205
01:12:39,732 --> 01:12:44,654
Gorgo say: Bees
and hornets be friends.

1206
01:12:44,862 --> 01:12:46,113
And Gorgo say:

1207
01:12:46,322 --> 01:12:48,658
Give little bees pollen
whenever they're hungry.

1208
01:12:48,866 --> 01:12:51,702
- Willi!
-And let little hornets explore

1209
01:12:51,911 --> 01:12:53,287
wherever they want.

1210
01:12:53,496 --> 01:12:55,915
And how about some respect for
dung beetles while you're at it?

1211
01:13:00,127 --> 01:13:07,343
If bees and hornets want
to fight, they can fight Gorgo.

1212
01:13:07,552 --> 01:13:09,136
- Oh.
-Huh?

1213
01:13:10,555 --> 01:13:13,057
- Hi.
-She's with the hornets.

1214
01:13:13,266 --> 01:13:15,643
Buzzywump?
He's been bee-napped.

1215
01:13:15,852 --> 01:13:19,105
No, he hasn't!
Hornets and bees can be friends.

1216
01:13:19,313 --> 01:13:20,231
Look.

1217
01:13:21,649 --> 01:13:23,067
Ff lends?

1218
01:13:23,276 --> 01:13:25,903
Not friends, Dad.
Best friends.

1219
01:13:26,112 --> 01:13:29,532
- But what about our camp?
-It wasn't us.

1220
01:13:29,740 --> 01:13:32,618
Whoa, whoa, listen, listen.
We didn't do nothing.

1221
01:13:32,827 --> 01:13:35,913
Those flimsy hornet-huts,
they just fell over.

1222
01:13:38,583 --> 01:13:40,376
Enough with the
stupid ants.

1223
01:13:40,585 --> 01:13:42,879
Get those filthy jelly thieves.

1224
01:13:45,298 --> 01:13:46,674
Yes!

1225
01:13:47,967 --> 01:13:50,344
- Charge!
-Wait!

1226
01:13:50,553 --> 01:13:54,724
They didn't steal the jelly.
It was the Royal Adviser.

1227
01:13:54,932 --> 01:13:57,226
She's hiding it under her crown.

1228
01:13:59,270 --> 01:14:00,396
Oh, please!

1229
01:14:01,272 --> 01:14:03,399
Can you really trust a bee

1230
01:14:03,608 --> 01:14:05,818
who sneaks around in disguises

1231
01:14:06,027 --> 01:14:10,990
playing foolish
children's... games?

1232
01:14:24,045 --> 01:14:26,714
No! Dad!
No, please!

1233
01:14:26,923 --> 01:14:28,132
Dad.No!

1234
01:14:28,758 --> 01:14:31,552
Dad! Dad! Dad!

1235
01:14:31,761 --> 01:14:34,388
We can't save them
unless we work together!

1236
01:14:34,597 --> 01:14:37,683
Everybody,
grab a piece of Gorgo!

1237
01:14:49,779 --> 01:14:51,030
Lift!

1238
01:14:57,536 --> 01:14:59,163
It's working!

1239
01:15:07,463 --> 01:15:09,340
- Dad.
-Son.

1240
01:15:10,424 --> 01:15:13,302
- Dad.
-My little Buzzywump.

1241
01:15:14,762 --> 01:15:17,598
You're not going cry,
are you, Dad?

1242
01:15:17,807 --> 01:15:18,641
Me? Pah, no.

1243
01:15:18,849 --> 01:15:21,227
I just got something in my eye.

1244
01:15:21,435 --> 01:15:22,728
That's my Dad.

1245
01:15:22,937 --> 01:15:25,147
Crawley, my crown.

1246
01:15:27,525 --> 01:15:30,194
Look!
The royal jelly!

1247
01:15:33,489 --> 01:15:36,200
Thief!
Arrest him!

1248
01:15:37,159 --> 01:15:39,161
What are you waiting for?

1249
01:15:41,038 --> 01:15:44,000
Crawley, arrest
this hive traitor

1250
01:15:44,208 --> 01:15:45,918
or I'll have your stripes.

1251
01:15:47,420 --> 01:15:49,547
- Crawley?
-EflOugh!

1252
01:15:49,755 --> 01:15:54,427
No more lies, Buzzlina.
You've caused enough hurt.

1253
01:15:54,635 --> 01:15:56,429
Are you disobeying me?

1254
01:15:56,637 --> 01:16:00,433
I am your Queen,
bow before me.

1255
01:16:00,641 --> 01:16:03,894
All of you
bow before your Queen.

1256
01:16:06,939 --> 01:16:09,275
That's more like it. You...

1257
01:16:09,483 --> 01:16:11,819
396, bow.

1258
01:16:16,240 --> 01:16:18,534
- That's better.
-Hee-hop.

1259
01:16:21,954 --> 01:16:23,622
It can't be!

1260
01:16:25,207 --> 01:16:28,085
Willi, the royal jelly.
Quick!

1261
01:16:34,508 --> 01:16:36,510
Drink, Your Majesty.

1262
01:16:38,929 --> 01:16:42,933
- Thank you, little one.
-Maya, we did it.

1263
01:16:57,782 --> 01:17:00,076
Buzzlina...

1264
01:17:02,661 --> 01:17:07,792
I know how this looks,
but I did it for the hive.

1265
01:17:08,000 --> 01:17:10,044
For all of us.

1266
01:17:10,252 --> 01:17:13,756
I just wanted us all
to be happy.

1267
01:17:18,094 --> 01:17:20,429
Your Majesty.

1268
01:17:23,432 --> 01:17:26,769
Fellow insects,
Maya is right.

1269
01:17:26,977 --> 01:17:30,815
We have no quarrel
with the hornets, or indeed

1270
01:17:31,023 --> 01:17:33,067
any other insects.

1271
01:17:34,527 --> 01:17:36,237
Ff lends?

1272
01:17:38,948 --> 01:17:41,242
Come on, Dad!

1273
01:17:41,450 --> 01:17:43,994
Ah, what the hedge?

1274
01:17:44,203 --> 01:17:45,871
Friends it is.

1275
01:17:48,833 --> 01:17:53,254
I now invite all insects
to the hive

1276
01:17:53,462 --> 01:17:55,840
for a royal celebration.

1277
01:18:01,637 --> 01:18:03,180
Oh yes, Maya.

1278
01:18:03,389 --> 01:18:07,768
Of course that
includes dung beetles.

1279
01:18:07,977 --> 01:18:09,436
I'm going to a party?

1280
01:18:09,645 --> 01:18:11,313
I'm going to a party!

1281
01:18:11,522 --> 01:18:13,149
I gotta bring a gift.

1282
01:18:13,357 --> 01:18:16,318
I'm gonna bring
the best ball ever!

1283
01:18:30,207 --> 01:18:36,297
Willi and Sting, for bravery
and services to bee-kind,

1284
01:18:36,505 --> 01:18:40,676
I declare you both
Hive Heroes.

1285
01:18:40,885 --> 01:18:42,386
That's my boy.

1286
01:18:46,515 --> 01:18:48,058
Maya.

1287
01:18:55,691 --> 01:18:57,610
My dear bees,

1288
01:18:57,818 --> 01:19:01,822
Maya has taught us that we
have a great deal to learn.

1289
01:19:02,031 --> 01:19:07,786
The meadow belongs to all bugs.
Not just to bees or hornets.

1290
01:19:07,995 --> 01:19:10,789
Every bug
has a role to play.

1291
01:19:10,956 --> 01:19:12,208
Oh, and me, Miss Queen?

1292
01:19:12,416 --> 01:19:14,793
What about me?
Do I have a role?

1293
01:19:15,002 --> 01:19:18,422
Of course, Maya.
A very important role.

1294
01:19:18,631 --> 01:19:22,885
I hereby declare you
Hive Ambassador.

1295
01:19:23,093 --> 01:19:25,638
You will discover things
about the meadow

1296
01:19:25,846 --> 01:19:27,723
and report back to us.

1297
01:19:27,932 --> 01:19:30,893
And I really am a
normal little bee?

1298
01:19:31,101 --> 01:19:32,645
Oh, no.

1299
01:19:33,771 --> 01:19:37,483
You are a very
special little bee.

1300
01:19:37,691 --> 01:19:38,943
Yes!

1301
01:19:40,402 --> 01:19:42,780
I fit in.
Did you hear the Queen?

1302
01:19:42,988 --> 01:19:45,616
There's a place
for me in the hive.

1303
01:19:45,824 --> 01:19:48,327
- Hit it, Flip.
-Let's boogie!

1304
01:19:54,416 --> 01:19:56,502
You. Me. Dancefloor.

1305
01:19:58,087 --> 01:20:00,714
Nobody puts Queenie
in the corner.

1306
01:20:01,924 --> 01:20:04,218
Buzzlina, buzz buzz.

1307
01:20:09,848 --> 01:20:12,559
Buzz, buzz, 127.
Back to work!

1308
01:20:14,270 --> 01:20:16,605
Special ball delivery.

1309
01:20:16,814 --> 01:20:18,023
Coming through.

1310
01:20:19,358 --> 01:20:21,986
I love this party!

1311
01:20:22,194 --> 01:20:23,988
- PoHen?
-PoHen!PoHen!

1312
01:20:25,197 --> 01:20:28,534
And around, and around,
and around...

1313
01:20:33,414 --> 01:20:34,665
Pollen!

1314
01:20:36,709 --> 01:20:38,419
Your Majesty...

1315
01:20:38,627 --> 01:20:39,712
Your Majesty.

1316
01:20:40,838 --> 01:20:43,549
Reports of new bugs
in the meadow.

1317
01:20:47,177 --> 01:20:50,806
Well, we should send
someone out to greet them.

1318
01:20:51,015 --> 01:20:52,266
Shouldn't we?

1319
01:20:54,351 --> 01:20:55,978
Maya?

1320
01:21:08,699 --> 01:21:10,284
Woo-hoe'.!

1321
01:21:16,623 --> 01:21:19,626
Maya!
Not so fast.

1322
01:21:19,835 --> 01:21:23,047
I forgot to tell you the most
important bee-saying of all:

1323
01:21:23,255 --> 01:21:26,342
"You should always
wait for Willi."

1324
01:21:26,550 --> 01:21:30,429
There's a place
very nearby,

1325
01:21:30,637 --> 01:21:34,475
Amongst the flowers
and the morning dew;

1326
01:21:34,683 --> 01:21:41,398
it's a secret paradise
Everybody's waiting just for you

1327
01:21:41,607 --> 01:21:45,861
Oh, here comes Maya the bee

1328
01:21:46,070 --> 01:21:50,199
With the greatest
friends that you'll ever see

1329
01:21:50,407 --> 01:21:52,910
Yes, here comes Maya the bee

1330
01:21:53,118 --> 01:21:56,914
With a brand new story
just for you and me

1331
01:21:57,081 --> 01:22:00,292
Yes, here comes Maya the bee

1332
01:22:00,501 --> 01:22:05,214
With a brand new story
just for you and me

1333
01:25:38,594 --> 01:25:42,639
Every little party bee
is coming down tonight

1334
01:25:42,848 --> 01:25:46,143
My friend Willi's joining me,
it's such a joyful sight

1335
01:25:46,351 --> 01:25:47,936
There's music playing
all night long

1336
01:25:48,145 --> 01:25:50,272
And Flip conducts
the band

1337
01:25:50,480 --> 01:25:52,274
And everyone bursts
into song

1338
01:25:52,482 --> 01:25:54,026
We scream and clap
our hands

1339
01:25:54,234 --> 01:25:56,028
'Cause here comes Maya

1340
01:25:56,236 --> 01:25:58,614
Sing and take a chance
'cause she'll be doing

1341
01:25:58,822 --> 01:26:01,450
She'll be doing
the Maya dance

1342
01:26:01,658 --> 01:26:05,495
And we are turning
shoo-be-doo-bee-do

1343
01:26:05,704 --> 01:26:09,333
And we are waving
shoo-be-doo-bee-day

1344
01:26:09,541 --> 01:26:13,086
And we are jumping
shoo-be-doo-bee-do

1345
01:26:13,295 --> 01:26:17,591
And we are singing 'till
the morning comes around

1346
01:26:19,593 --> 01:26:21,470
We are having
such a ball

1347
01:26:21,678 --> 01:26:23,597
We're dancing all
in line

1348
01:26:23,805 --> 01:26:27,267
Every creature great and
small is waiting for the sign

1349
01:26:27,476 --> 01:26:31,313
Pay attention, here it comes
the star is in the house

1350
01:26:31,521 --> 01:26:33,148
Hit the lights and
roll the drums

1351
01:26:33,357 --> 01:26:35,192
We're quiet as a mouse

1352
01:26:35,400 --> 01:26:37,235
'Cause here comes Maya

1353
01:26:37,444 --> 01:26:39,863
Sing and take a chance
'cause she'll be doing

1354
01:26:40,072 --> 01:26:42,783
She'll be doing
the Maya dance

1355
01:26:42,991 --> 01:26:46,578
And we are turning
shoo-be-doo-bee-do

1356
01:26:46,787 --> 01:26:50,290
And we are waving
shoo-be-doo-bee-day

1357
01:26:50,499 --> 01:26:54,211
And we are jumping
shoo-be-doo-bee-do

1358
01:26:54,419 --> 01:26:58,173
And we are singing 'till
the morning comes around

1359
01:26:58,382 --> 01:27:01,968
And we are turning
shoo-be-doo-bee-do

01:27:02,177 --> 01:27:05,889
And we are waving
shoo-be-doo-bee-day

1361
01:27:06,098 --> 01:27:09,726
And we are jumping
shoo-be-doo-bee-do

1362
01:27:09,935 --> 01:27:14,147
And we are singing 'till
the morning comes around

1363
01:27:14,356 --> 01:27:16,358
How I wish this
party night would

1364
01:27:16,566 --> 01:27:18,235
Never, ever end

1365
01:27:18,443 --> 01:27:20,237
When we see the
sunrise we will

1366
01:27:20,445 --> 01:27:22,197
Say goodbye my friend

1367
01:27:22,406 --> 01:27:23,990
But right now we're
dancing and we're

1368
01:27:24,199 --> 01:27:26,201
Having such a blast

1369
01:27:26,410 --> 01:27:29,496
Come on and let's
party while it lasts

1370
01:27:29,705 --> 01:27:33,041
And we are turning
shoo-be-doo-bee-do

1371
01:27:33,250 --> 01:27:36,962
And we are waving
shoo-be-doo-bee-day

1372
01:27:37,170 --> 01:27:41,049
And we are jumping
shoo-be-doo-bee-do

1373
01:27:41,258 --> 01:27:45,095
And we are singing 'till
the morning comes around
