Use the winch in your pup pack to get
the driver and bring him to safety!

Chase is on the case!

58

Oh, thank you, thank you, thank
you, the rescue team is here!

A dog?

62
00:05:02,868 --> 00:05:05,471
Actually, sir,
I'm a puppy.

63
00:05:05,538 --> 00:05:07,807

That's even worse!

going to hold much longer!

has happened.

179
00:11:03,929 --> 00:11:06,865
Humdinger was just
elected mayor.

180
00:11:06,932 --> 00:11:08,500
Humdinger?

181
00:11:08,567 --> 00:11:11,537
He's the worst mayor
in the history of mayors!

182
00:11:11,603 --> 00:11:13,505
And that's
being generous.

183
00:11:13,572 --> 00:11:16,141
You're telling me,
this guy's a disaster!

184
00:11:16,208 --> 00:11:18,610
He's going to destroy
the whole city.

185
00:11:18,677 --> 00:11:20,012
Please, we need your help.

186
00:11:20,079 --> 00:11:21,280
Come quickly!

187
00:11:22,214 --> 00:11:23,916
Adventure City's in trouble.

188
00:11:23,982 --> 00:11:25,918
Come on, pups,
pack your things.

189
00:11:25,984 --> 00:11:28,754
No city's too big,
no pup's too small!

190
00:11:29,955 --> 00:11:31,790
Yeah!

191
00:11:31,857 --> 00:11:33,359
What's wrong, Chase?

192
00:11:33,425 --> 00:11:34,760
I'm not going.

193
00:11:34,827 --> 00:11:37,062
We have to go.
They need us.

194
00:11:37,129 --> 00:11:39,565
I'm never going back to
Adventure City!

195
00:11:40,733 --> 00:11:42,167
Chase...

196
00:11:42,234 --> 00:11:44,470
What's got his leash in a knot?

197
00:11:44,536 --> 00:11:48,040
Chase has a history
with Adventure City.

198
00:11:48,107 --> 00:11:51,076
He has a lot of tough memories
from that place.

199
00:11:53,245 --> 00:11:55,347
He was abandoned there
as a pup.

200
00:12:00,352 --> 00:12:03,555
The city was so big,
and he was so small.

201
00:12:10,796 --> 00:12:12,531
It was a hard life.

202
00:12:20,239 --> 00:12:23,409
The city can be a scary place
when you're all alone.

203
00:12:23,475 --> 00:12:26,512
- Is that where you found him?
- That's right.

204
00:12:26,578 --> 00:12:29,248
And I brought him back here
to Adventure Bay.

205
00:12:35,521 --> 00:12:36,822
Chase?

206
00:12:37,756 --> 00:12:39,224
Let's talk
about this.

207
00:12:40,125 --> 00:12:42,461
I don't want to go back to
Adventure City.

208
00:12:42,528 --> 00:12:46,198
I know it was tough,
but that was a long time ago.

209
00:12:46,265 --> 00:12:48,100
I'm afraid
if I go back there,

210
00:12:48,167 --> 00:12:51,103
everyone will see I'm still
that scared little puppy,

211
00:12:51,170 --> 00:12:53,672
and not the hero
they think I am.

212
00:12:53,739 --> 00:12:57,176
I promise it will be nothing
like it was when you were little.

213
00:12:57,242 --> 00:12:59,378
Everything will be fine.

214
00:12:59,445 --> 00:13:02,080
Come on, Chase.
Those people need our help.

215
00:13:02,147 --> 00:13:05,150
We're the PAW Patrol,
this is what we do.

216
00:13:05,584 --> 00:13:06,585
Trust me.

217
00:13:09,755 --> 00:13:12,224
Okay. I trust you.

218
00:13:12,291 --> 00:13:14,593
Now, can I get a yelp?

219
00:13:16,228 --> 00:13:19,231
Come on. You can do
better than that.

220
00:13:22,067 --> 00:13:24,303
Attaboy!
Let's get to work.

221
00:13:27,339 --> 00:13:32,144
Skye, Chase, Rocky,
Marshall, Zuma...

222
00:13:34,546 --> 00:13:36,315
Rubble!

223
00:13:36,381 --> 00:13:39,751
It's not my fault!
I couldn't decide what to bring.

224
00:13:39,818 --> 00:13:41,653
So I brought everything!

225
00:13:46,024 --> 00:13:50,329
Get there, come on.
Come on, come on!

226
00:13:51,763 --> 00:13:53,432
See? It fits!

227
00:13:58,237 --> 00:14:00,873
PAW Patrol is on a roll!

228
00:14:00,939 --> 00:14:02,608

Oh, wow!

- Check it out!
- Cool!

252
00:15:24,556 --> 00:15:27,025
- No way!
- It's amazing!

253
00:15:27,092 --> 00:15:30,662
This place is so much
bigger than Adventure Bay.

254
00:15:33,966 --> 00:15:35,634
You okay, Chase?

255
00:15:35,701 --> 00:15:38,737
It's a lot bigger
than I remember.

256
00:15:41,373 --> 00:15:43,976
It's like they super-sized it!

257
00:15:53,952 --> 00:15:55,420
Ugh! Rain!

258
00:15:55,487 --> 00:15:58,657
Does it always rain
in this lousy city?

259
00:16:07,699 --> 00:16:10,769
Okay, which one of you
eggheads is in charge?

260
00:16:10,836 --> 00:16:12,337
- Hello!
- Gah!

261
00:16:12,404 --> 00:16:14,840
I'm the lead egghead.
Kendra Wilson.

262
00:16:15,107 --> 00:16:16,174
Hmm.

263
00:16:16,241 --> 00:16:17,909
I've got a fireworks
celebration tonight

264
00:16:17,976 --> 00:16:20,512
and they're going to cancel
it because of the rain.

265
00:16:20,579 --> 00:16:24,616
I hear you have a weather
machine that sucks up clouds.

266
00:16:24,683 --> 00:16:25,984
Is that true?

267
00:16:26,051 --> 00:16:27,352
You're looking at it.

268
00:16:27,419 --> 00:16:29,421
It's a free-floating
gyroscopically balanced

269
00:16:29,488 --> 00:16:32,691
remote-controlled weather
containment and analysis apparatus.

270
00:16:32,758 --> 00:16:36,294
What? I don't understand
a word you just said.

271
00:16:36,862 --> 00:16:37,863
Well...

272
00:16:37,929 --> 00:16:39,364
We call it the Cloud Catcher.

273
00:16:39,431 --> 00:16:41,133
It flies around
and sucks up clouds,

274
00:16:41,199 --> 00:16:44,369
then brings them back to the
lab so we can study them.

275
00:16:44,436 --> 00:16:45,937
Excellent,
excellent.

276
00:16:46,004 --> 00:16:49,675
Well, kitties, it looks like our
bad weather problem is solved.

277
00:16:49,741 --> 00:16:53,111
I want all those pesky rain clouds
sucked up by the end of the day.

278
00:16:53,178 --> 00:16:55,814
Oh! I'm sorry
if I wasn't clear.

279
00:16:55,881 --> 00:16:58,383
The Cloud Catcher is for
studying clouds,

280
00:16:58,450 --> 00:17:00,152
not for changing
the weather.

281
00:17:00,218 --> 00:17:02,788
And I'm sorry
if I wasn't clear.

282
00:17:02,854 --> 00:17:06,725
Suck up those clouds or I'm
closing this university forever!

283
00:17:08,627 --> 00:17:09,695
Well...

284
00:17:09,761 --> 00:17:14,032
I guess we could try using
it to clear the rain clouds.

285
00:17:14,099 --> 00:17:16,134
- Just for tonight.
- Wonderful!

286
00:17:16,201 --> 00:17:19,705
That's what I call
scientific consensus!

287
00:17:34,820 --> 00:17:35,921
Oh!

288
00:17:36,955 --> 00:17:38,223
My top hat!

289
00:17:38,290 --> 00:17:39,858
Here you go, boss.

290
00:18:00,345 --> 00:18:02,380
That's incredible!

291
00:18:05,751 --> 00:18:08,520
We'll have the sky
clear by sundown.

292
00:18:08,587 --> 00:18:11,389
Ugh! I've got a bad
feeling about this.

293
00:18:11,456 --> 00:18:12,924
I'll hang on to this remote!

294
00:18:12,991 --> 00:18:15,060
People are going to
love these fireworks,

295
00:18:15,127 --> 00:18:18,897
and more importantly,
they're going to love me!

296
00:18:26,404 --> 00:18:29,274
All right, pups,
keep an eye out for the new headquarters.

297
00:18:29,341 --> 00:18:30,609
- We're almost there.
- Yeah!

298
00:18:30,675 --> 00:18:32,811
- Cool!
- I can't wait!

299
00:18:32,878 --> 00:18:35,413
- Where is it?
- There are so many buildings!

300
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:37,182
I wonder
which one it is.

301
00:18:39,484 --> 00:18:41,119
Whoa!

302
00:18:41,186 --> 00:18:42,254
Oh.

303
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:44,156
Yeah.
Couldn't have missed that.

304
00:19:06,044 --> 00:19:07,279
Whoa!

305
00:19:07,345 --> 00:19:11,116
Welcome to our new
Adventure City headquarters.

306
00:19:11,183 --> 00:19:12,751
- Whoa!
- Wow!

307
00:19:12,818 --> 00:19:13,819
Awesome!

308
00:19:13,885 --> 00:19:15,220
Now that's a view!

309
00:19:15,287 --> 00:19:16,788
Whoa!

310
00:19:16,855 --> 00:19:19,491
How can we afford
this place?

311
00:19:19,558 --> 00:19:21,827
Officially licensed
PAW Patrol merchandise.

312
00:19:21,893 --> 00:19:23,962
This stuff sells
like hot cakes!

313
00:19:25,063 --> 00:19:27,566
We've got everything we need
at our fingertips.

314
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:29,568
Ahhh!

315
00:19:30,702 --> 00:19:32,103
- Marshall!
- Marshall!

316
00:19:32,170 --> 00:19:35,273
Next time, warn me before you
stick a building up my nose!

317
00:19:36,575 --> 00:19:38,510
This is
so cool!

318
00:19:38,577 --> 00:19:40,212
It's so high-tech!

319
00:19:41,079 --> 00:19:42,180
And check this out.

320
00:19:42,247 --> 00:19:45,417
There's even a new and
improved pup treat dispenser.

321
00:19:54,259 --> 00:19:57,629
What? It's a
beautiful thing.

322
00:19:57,696 --> 00:20:00,632
Last but not least,
this is our mission prep area.

323
00:20:00,699 --> 00:20:03,301
Everybody's got
their own cubby.

324
00:20:03,368 --> 00:20:04,803
Oh, Oh, Oh!
I want that one!

325
00:20:04,870 --> 00:20:07,138
No, Rubble, don't!
No, cubby belongs to...

326
00:20:09,608 --> 00:20:10,976
Skye!

327
00:20:13,078 --> 00:20:14,546
...Skye.

328
00:20:15,180 --> 00:20:16,314
Oops.

329
00:20:16,381 --> 00:20:19,885
It's not important how it looks,
it's how it makes you feel.

330
00:20:19,951 --> 00:20:23,188
I think you guys are going to
have to cut me out of this thing.

331
00:20:25,590 --> 00:20:27,292
Actually, I'm good.

332
00:20:39,971 --> 00:20:42,674
Ladies and gentlemen,
I've gathered you here tonight

333
00:20:42,741 --> 00:20:45,043
for a very important reason.

334
00:20:45,110 --> 00:20:46,778
To celebrate me!

335
00:20:47,812 --> 00:20:49,547
Prepare to be blown away

336
00:20:49,614 --> 00:20:53,818
by the most breathtaking fireworks
display you've ever seen!

337
00:20:53,885 --> 00:20:58,056
Time to light up the sky!

338
00:21:10,502 --> 00:21:13,672
Yeesh! This is less
than spectacular.

339
00:21:13,738 --> 00:21:15,040
You, ponytail man!

340
00:21:15,106 --> 00:21:17,542
Why are you taking so long
between fireworks?

341
00:21:17,609 --> 00:21:19,577
I'm building
momentum, man.

342
00:21:19,644 --> 00:21:22,447
I have a whole routine
mapped out in my head.

343
00:21:22,514 --> 00:21:24,449
Nobody's got time for your
self-indulgent,

344
00:21:24,516 --> 00:21:26,151
hippy-dippy art project.

345
00:21:26,217 --> 00:21:28,053
They want spectacle!

346
00:21:39,364 --> 00:21:42,367
Rock and roll, man!

347
00:21:45,537 --> 00:21:47,572
Yay!

348
00:21:47,639 --> 00:21:49,240
They're all for me!

349
00:22:04,356 --> 00:22:05,457
Ahhh!

350
00:22:05,523 --> 00:22:06,558
Oh, boy!

351
00:22:06,624 --> 00:22:08,059
Whoa!

352
00:22:09,627 --> 00:22:11,296
Oh! Wow!

353
00:22:11,363 --> 00:22:14,799
How often do you get to see
fireworks this close?

354
00:22:16,034 --> 00:22:17,369
My top hat!

355
00:22:17,435 --> 00:22:18,970
- Here you go, boss!
- Ahhh!

356
00:22:22,507 --> 00:22:25,076
This is why
dogs hate fireworks!

357
00:22:28,179 --> 00:22:29,748
Whoa...

358
00:22:36,321 --> 00:22:37,789
I'm no expert,

359
00:22:37,856 --> 00:22:41,659
but aren't fireworks supposed
to explode in the sky?

360
00:22:42,727 --> 00:22:44,329
Let's see what's going on!

361
00:22:45,997 --> 00:22:48,733
It looks like Mayor
Humdinger's fireworks display

362
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:51,202
has turned into
a fireworks disaster.

363
00:22:51,269 --> 00:22:55,106
We've got to stop those fireworks
before they burn down the city.

364
00:22:55,173 --> 00:22:56,441
Time to suit up!

365
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:29,707
Whoa!

366
00:23:39,617 --> 00:23:41,786
Thanks, robot arm!

367
00:23:41,853 --> 00:23:44,856

Ryder sir!

This is your new car.

370
00:24:30,268 --> 00:24:31,336
Wow!

371
00:24:31,402 --> 00:24:32,770
Awesome!

372
00:24:45,683 --> 00:24:47,118
So cool!

373
00:24:55,026 --> 00:24:57,562

you give Humdinger fireworks!

The PAW Patrol?

425
00:27:39,390 --> 00:27:41,726

in Adventure City?

426
00:27:41,793 --> 00:27:43,795

put out those fireworks!

431
00:28:11,589 --> 00:28:14,726
Let's kick the tires
and fight some fires!

432
00:28:19,030 --> 00:28:21,399
Mr. Mayor, we've got
to get you out of here.

433
00:28:21,466 --> 00:28:24,202
I can't believe the PAW
Patrol crashed my party.

434
00:28:24,268 --> 00:28:26,404
- Yes, sir.
- I can't stand those dogs!

435
00:28:26,471 --> 00:28:27,905
Everyone knows
you're a cat person.

436
00:28:27,972 --> 00:28:29,474
- I can't stand them!
- Yes, sir.

437
00:28:29,540 --> 00:28:30,875
Hey, wait up!

438
00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:38,683
Time to fight some fireworks!

439
00:28:41,285 --> 00:28:43,521
We're gonna need more water!

440
00:28:43,588 --> 00:28:45,456
Arf! Water cannon!

441
00:28:50,962 --> 00:28:54,232
Yes! Now that's what
I'm talking about.

442
00:29:02,774 --> 00:29:06,043
- Nice work, Marshall!
- Thank you.

443
00:29:06,110 --> 00:29:07,712

444
00:29:07,779 --> 00:29:10,047
Okay, I got it from here!

445
00:29:16,788 --> 00:29:18,489

446
00:29:19,524 --> 00:29:21,592
Whoa! Whoa!

00:29:21,659 --> 00:29:23,594

449
00:29:25,997 --> 00:29:28,533

451
00:29:37,575 --> 00:29:41,179

on the balcony! I'm going in.

452
00:29:41,245 --> 00:29:42,380
Copy that.

453
00:29:44,749 --> 00:29:46,217
Arf! Eject!

454
00:29:47,618 --> 00:29:49,487
Arf! Parachute!

455
00:29:56,794 --> 00:29:58,229
Everything's going to be fine.

456
00:29:58,296 --> 00:30:00,097
I'm going
to get you out of here.

457
00:30:00,965 --> 00:30:04,769
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

458
00:30:06,070 --> 00:30:08,339
Ryder, help!

459
00:30:08,406 --> 00:30:10,641
Marshall! Chase needs help!

460
00:30:11,476 --> 00:30:13,144
I'm on it!

461
00:30:32,497 --> 00:30:35,266
Stand back!
Get away from the edge!

462
00:30:41,839 --> 00:30:43,441
Help me get him down!

463
00:30:44,242 --> 00:30:46,577
- Careful.
- Help me get him off.

464
00:30:53,484 --> 00:30:55,720
It's okay, buddy.
I've got you.

465
00:31:02,293 --> 00:31:05,429
- Say cheese!
- Cheese!

466
00:31:05,496 --> 00:31:07,832
Hey! Hey! Anyone want
a picture with me?

467
00:31:07,899 --> 00:31:10,868
I'm kind of like an honorary
member of the PAW Patrol.

468
00:31:10,935 --> 00:31:12,403
You should have
seen me out there.

469
00:31:12,470 --> 00:31:16,040
I was like, "Turn left, turn
right, turn left, turn right..."

470
00:31:16,107 --> 00:31:17,675
It was amazing!

471
00:31:22,046 --> 00:31:23,614
You look okay.

472
00:31:23,681 --> 00:31:24,849
How do you feel?

473
00:31:24,916 --> 00:31:28,152
I can't believe I forgot
to disconnect my parachute.

474
00:31:28,219 --> 00:31:30,821
It's Air Rescue 101.

475
00:31:30,888 --> 00:31:32,857
Well, that's why
we're a team.

476
00:31:32,924 --> 00:31:36,761
Everyone pulled together,
and things worked out okay.

477
00:31:36,827 --> 00:31:38,095
But what if
they didn't?

478
00:31:38,162 --> 00:31:41,399
What if something happened to those
people and it was all my fault?

479
00:31:45,002 --> 00:31:46,370
Guardians. Heroes.

480
00:31:46,437 --> 00:31:48,873
Cute little dogs
in adorable outfits.

481
00:31:48,940 --> 00:31:51,509
Whatever you call them,
the PAW Patrol were here

482
00:31:51,576 --> 00:31:54,078
to save the city
from Mayor Humdinger's

483
00:31:54,145 --> 00:31:56,213
disastrous fireworks debacle.

484
00:31:56,280 --> 00:32:00,318

it's important that I remain unbiased.

485
00:32:00,384 --> 00:32:03,421
That being said...
Oh, yikes!

486
00:32:03,487 --> 00:32:06,090
An embarrassing start
for Mayor Humdinger,

487
00:32:06,157 --> 00:32:10,995
but an incredible debut for the
PAW Patrol in Adventure City!

488
00:32:12,363 --> 00:32:14,665
PAW Patrol? PAW Patrol?

489
00:32:14,732 --> 00:32:17,768
I'm sick and tired of
hearing about the PAW Patrol!

490
00:32:17,835 --> 00:32:20,504
I came to Adventure City
to get away from them

491
00:32:20,571 --> 00:32:22,406
and make a name for myself.

492
00:32:22,473 --> 00:32:26,177
Now they're all over the TV
stealing my headlines!

493
00:32:26,243 --> 00:32:28,079

00:32:28,145 --> 00:32:29,380

497

Find them, catch them,
and lock them away.

498
00:32:38,623 --> 00:32:40,257
- Yes, sir.
- Right away, sir.

499
00:32:41,826 --> 00:32:47,231
The PAW Patrol have humiliated
me for the last time!

500
00:32:47,298 --> 00:32:49,200

say something?

501
00:32:49,266 --> 00:32:50,935

it was the best night of my life.

527

For a few hours, it was like I was
a real member of the PAW Patrol.

528
00:34:58,462 --> 00:34:59,730
Imagine that, huh?

529

"The newest member of
the PAW Patrol, Liberty!"

530
00:35:04,068 --> 00:35:05,736
Yeah, right, I wish.

531
00:35:05,803 --> 00:35:08,506
I heard that new mayor is
monkeying with the subway now.

00:35:08,572 --> 00:35:10,608
You better stay off
those trains, kiddo.

533
00:35:10,674 --> 00:35:13,911
- Stick to your wagon.
- Thanks for the tip, Tony.

534
00:35:13,978 --> 00:35:16,747
Hey, Liberty.
Take one for the road!

535
00:35:16,814 --> 00:35:18,048
Thank you!

536
00:35:31,562 --> 00:35:34,265
Another perfect day
in Adventure City.

537
00:35:34,331 --> 00:35:36,700
Enjoy that sunbeam, kitties.

538
00:35:38,035 --> 00:35:39,270
Mr. Mayor!

539
00:35:39,336 --> 00:35:42,006
The Cloud Catcher's hygrometer
is overloading the capacity

540
00:35:42,072 --> 00:35:44,975
of its pressurized internal
containment chamber!

541
00:35:45,042 --> 00:35:48,712
What? Do I look like
a scientist to you?

542
00:35:48,779 --> 00:35:52,049
We need to bring down
the Cloud Catcher now!

543
00:35:52,116 --> 00:35:54,051
And ruin this
beautiful weather?

544
00:35:54,118 --> 00:35:57,488
The Cloud Catcher wasn't
designed to run non-stop.

545
00:35:57,555 --> 00:35:59,590
Nonsense!
As long as I'm mayor,

546
00:35:59,657 --> 00:36:02,626
the sun will always shine
on Adventure City.

547
00:36:02,693 --> 00:36:04,528
Now get her out of here.

548
00:36:04,595 --> 00:36:06,096
Get out of here!

549
00:36:06,163 --> 00:36:09,166
What are you doin'? I'm the one who
tells people to get out of here.

550
00:36:09,233 --> 00:36:10,668
No, you're not.
I'm in charge!

551
00:36:10,734 --> 00:36:12,369
- No, I'm in charge!
- I'm in charge!

552
00:36:12,436 --> 00:36:14,038
I'm in charge!

553
00:36:16,507 --> 00:36:18,242
Citizens of Adventure City!

554
00:36:18,309 --> 00:36:21,545
As your new, and already
favorite, mayor,

555
00:36:21,612 --> 00:36:24,348
I proudly present
the next step in my plan

556
00:36:24,415 --> 00:36:27,184
to put the adventure
in Adventure City.

557
00:36:29,420 --> 00:36:31,655
The Humdinger Hyperloop!

558
00:36:31,722 --> 00:36:34,592
The kookiest, swoopiest,
loop-de-loopiest subway

559
00:36:34,658 --> 00:36:37,194
the world has ever seen!

560
00:36:38,028 --> 00:36:40,331
Mmm-mmm. I am not
riding that thing.

561
00:36:40,397 --> 00:36:41,966
Mr. Mayor,
Mr. Mayor!

562
00:36:42,032 --> 00:36:45,736
Have you considered the possibility
that this is the single dumbest idea

563
00:36:45,803 --> 00:36:49,440
that anyone
has ever had ever?

564
00:36:49,506 --> 00:36:51,475
I'm an unqualified
elected official.

565
00:36:51,542 --> 00:36:53,978
What's the worst
that could happen?

566
00:36:54,044 --> 00:36:57,348
Look, here comes
the express train now.

567
00:36:57,414 --> 00:36:59,283
Throw the switch, kitties!

568
00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:12,963
Whee!

569
00:37:31,682 --> 00:37:34,585
Ooh! That is not good.

570
00:37:34,652 --> 00:37:36,687
Butch, get the car.
Ruben, get the kitties.

571
00:37:36,754 --> 00:37:38,656
Time for me to vamoose!

572
00:37:45,963 --> 00:37:47,965
PAW Patrol,
what's your emergency?

573
00:37:48,032 --> 00:37:49,733
Help! Help us!

574
00:37:49,800 --> 00:37:53,103
Mayor Humdinger stuck a loop-de-loop
in the middle of the subway track,

575
00:37:53,170 --> 00:37:56,106
and now, we're hanging on
for dear life!

576
00:37:56,173 --> 00:37:59,543
This is a new low for
subway service in this city,

577
00:37:59,610 --> 00:38:01,612
and that is
saying something!

578
00:38:01,679 --> 00:38:04,081
Hang tight!
We're on our way!

579
00:38:04,148 --> 00:38:05,215
Okay, pups.

580
00:38:05,282 --> 00:38:07,451
We've got to rescue the
passengers on that train

581
00:38:07,518 --> 00:38:09,853
before the whole thing
comes crashing down.

582
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:11,155
Let's move!

583
00:38:11,221 --> 00:38:13,457
PAW Patrol is on a roll!

584
00:38:13,524 --> 00:38:14,959
Yeah!

585
00:38:16,894 --> 00:38:20,931
Marty Muckraker reporting live from
Mayor Humdinger's latest disaster.

586
00:38:20,998 --> 00:38:24,802
In a surprising twist
that surprised nobody,

587
00:38:24,868 --> 00:38:26,870
the shoddily built
upside-down subway

588
00:38:26,937 --> 00:38:29,673
turned out to be
a steaming hot pile of,

589
00:38:29,740 --> 00:38:32,443
dare I say, poop.

590
00:38:33,744 --> 00:38:36,046
Look, Mom,
the PAW Patrol!

591
00:38:38,682 --> 00:38:42,219
I can't believe Humdinger
thought this was a good idea.

592
00:38:42,286 --> 00:38:45,255
The subway's wild enough
without a stinkin' loop-de-loop!

593
00:38:45,689 --> 00:38:47,458
Hey, Liberty!

594
00:38:47,524 --> 00:38:49,460
Reporting for duty.

595
00:38:49,526 --> 00:38:52,763
Unofficially, of course.
You know, like an honorary member.

596
00:38:56,233 --> 00:38:58,635
Rocky, I need you
to stabilize that loop.

597
00:38:58,702 --> 00:39:00,738
Rubble, see if you can
lock it into place

598
00:39:00,804 --> 00:39:02,272
with some
quick-dry cement.

599
00:39:02,339 --> 00:39:03,540
We're on it!

600
00:39:03,607 --> 00:39:06,577
Skye, I need you to
secure that loop from the air.

601
00:39:06,643 --> 00:39:08,879
Let's take to the sky!

602
00:39:11,749 --> 00:39:15,519
Don't worry, Ryder, I've got
crowd control under control.

603
00:39:15,586 --> 00:39:17,721
Stand back!
Give us some space!

604
00:39:17,788 --> 00:39:19,056
PAW Patrol at work!

605
00:39:19,123 --> 00:39:20,991
I'm an honorary member
at the moment,

606
00:39:21,058 --> 00:39:23,527
but my authority
should still be respected.

607
00:39:31,368 --> 00:39:33,404
Arf! Hydraulic arms!

608
00:39:37,074 --> 00:39:38,275
Gotcha!

609
00:39:43,881 --> 00:39:45,749
- Hey, look!
- It's Skye!

610
00:39:49,620 --> 00:39:52,089
Time for a little more power.

611
00:39:52,156 --> 00:39:54,291
Arf! Afterburners!

612
00:40:01,832 --> 00:40:04,468
Okay, Rubble, let 'er rip!

613
00:40:06,303 --> 00:40:08,372
Rubble on the double!

614
00:40:18,749 --> 00:40:20,484
The track is secure!

615
00:40:20,551 --> 00:40:21,919
Yeah, Rubble!

616
00:40:22,586 --> 00:40:24,188
Nice work, Rubble!

617
00:40:24,254 --> 00:40:26,690
Chase, we've got to
rescue those people.

618
00:40:26,757 --> 00:40:28,192
Are you up for it?

619
00:40:28,859 --> 00:40:30,594
Chase is on the case.

620
00:40:50,914 --> 00:40:53,283
Hang on!
You're going to be okay.

621
00:40:53,817 --> 00:40:55,385
Arf! Zipline!

622
00:41:00,924 --> 00:41:03,760
Chase! Chase! Chase!

623
00:41:03,827 --> 00:41:05,496
How are you
holding up, Chase?

624
00:41:05,562 --> 00:41:06,563
I'm fine.

625
00:41:06,630 --> 00:41:07,631
Are you sure?

626
00:41:07,698 --> 00:41:08,866
I can do this!

627
00:41:08,932 --> 00:41:10,400
- Chase! Chase!
- You can do it, Chase!

628
00:41:10,467 --> 00:41:11,602
I can do this.

629
00:41:11,668 --> 00:41:14,204
Chase! Chase!

630
00:41:14,271 --> 00:41:15,472
I can do this.

631
00:41:17,541 --> 00:41:18,675
I can...

632
00:41:25,716 --> 00:41:27,951
Chase?
Chase, do you copy?

633
00:41:31,655 --> 00:41:33,857
Ryder, we've got a problem.

634
00:41:33,924 --> 00:41:34,925
What's going on?

635
00:41:34,992 --> 00:41:36,960
It's Chase.
Something's wrong.

636
00:41:37,027 --> 00:41:38,862
He's just standing there.

637
00:41:43,433 --> 00:41:46,703
Chase is in trouble.
Skye, bring him down.

638
00:41:46,770 --> 00:41:49,072
Marshall, get your ladder up
to the train.

639
00:41:49,139 --> 00:41:50,274
I'm on it!

640
00:42:01,218 --> 00:42:03,520
I think I can
reach them from here.

641
00:42:03,587 --> 00:42:04,988
Arf! Ladder!

642
00:42:24,007 --> 00:42:27,644
Please exit the
train and proceed down the ladder.

643
00:42:30,581 --> 00:42:32,516
This should speed things up.

644
00:42:32,583 --> 00:42:34,418
Arf! Ladder slide!

645
00:42:36,053 --> 00:42:38,088
Here goes nothing!

646
00:42:38,522 --> 00:42:40,090
Whoo-hoo!

647
00:42:42,159 --> 00:42:44,094
Nice work, Marshall!

648
00:42:50,801 --> 00:42:52,002
Chase?

649
00:42:52,069 --> 00:42:54,171
I'm coming out to get you.

650
00:42:56,473 --> 00:42:57,808
What's wrong?

651
00:42:57,874 --> 00:42:59,276
Tell me what happened.

652
00:42:59,743 --> 00:43:01,378
I don't know.

653
00:43:01,445 --> 00:43:05,249
I just froze.

654
00:43:05,315 --> 00:43:09,286
It's okay. Everyone's safe.
Let's get you down.

655
00:43:37,614 --> 00:43:39,716
Okay, that's all of them.

656
00:43:39,783 --> 00:43:41,451
Good job, pups.

657
00:43:43,453 --> 00:43:44,621
Chase...

658
00:43:45,922 --> 00:43:48,091
I don't know
what happened.

659
00:43:48,158 --> 00:43:49,960
I'm just glad
you're okay.

660
00:43:51,028 --> 00:43:54,564
- I'm sorry.
- No, it's my fault.

661
00:43:54,631 --> 00:43:56,967
I thought you'd be
okay in Adventure City,

662
00:43:57,034 --> 00:43:58,869
but it's still
too much for you.

663
00:43:58,935 --> 00:44:00,737
I'll be fine.
I just need to...

664
00:44:00,804 --> 00:44:03,907
You're not fine.
You need to take a break.

665
00:44:03,974 --> 00:44:06,710
We'll take care of the
rescues for a while.

666
00:44:06,777 --> 00:44:08,612
What? No!

667
00:44:08,679 --> 00:44:10,681
That's not fair.

668
00:44:10,747 --> 00:44:12,249
I'm sorry, Chase.

669
00:44:12,316 --> 00:44:15,485
I know it's hard,
but it's the way it's got to be.

670
00:44:17,621 --> 00:44:20,324
I didn't even want to
come to Adventure City!

671
00:44:20,390 --> 00:44:21,425
I trusted you.

672
00:44:21,491 --> 00:44:24,594
You said everything would be
fine, but it's not!

673
00:44:24,661 --> 00:44:28,498
What kind of leader gives up on
someone the second things get hard?

674
00:44:28,565 --> 00:44:29,733
Chase...

675
00:44:31,868 --> 00:44:33,437
Chase, wait!

676
00:44:54,024 --> 00:44:55,092
Oh-ho!

677
00:44:55,158 --> 00:44:56,593
What do we
have here?

678
00:44:56,660 --> 00:45:00,197
Looks like we got one of them
PAW Patrols all on his own.

679
00:45:00,263 --> 00:45:02,532
Get the net.

680
00:45:03,767 --> 00:45:06,570
Chase? Chase!

681
00:45:06,636 --> 00:45:08,605
- Come on, Chase.
- Chase?

682
00:45:08,672 --> 00:45:09,973
Chase!

683
00:45:10,040 --> 00:45:11,842
Hey, buddy,
where are you?

684
00:45:11,908 --> 00:45:15,112
Where'd you go, bud? Chase!

685
00:45:20,884 --> 00:45:23,353
- Oh, no.
- Where did he go?

686
00:45:24,254 --> 00:45:25,922
I was right
behind him.

687
00:45:25,989 --> 00:45:28,258
I turned the corner
and he was gone.

688
00:45:28,859 --> 00:45:31,161
He just disappeared.

689
00:45:31,228 --> 00:45:33,497
- What are we going to do?
- I don't know.

690
00:45:33,563 --> 00:45:37,501
There's no way for us to track him
if he's not wearing his pup tag.

691
00:45:37,567 --> 00:45:39,403
We might not have
a tracking collar,

692
00:45:39,469 --> 00:45:42,372
but the city has eyes,
and the city has ears.

693
00:45:42,439 --> 00:45:44,174
Somebody had
to see something.

694
00:45:44,241 --> 00:45:46,410
Okay.
Where do we start?

695
00:45:46,476 --> 00:45:48,145
We need to pound
the pavement.

696
00:45:48,211 --> 00:45:50,447
I'll get my jackhammer!

697
00:45:50,514 --> 00:45:52,249
No, not like that.

698
00:45:52,315 --> 00:45:55,352
"Pound the pavement" means we're
gonna need to talk to everyone.

699
00:45:55,419 --> 00:45:56,586
Ask questions.

700
00:45:56,653 --> 00:45:57,921
Leave no
stone unturned.

701
00:45:57,988 --> 00:46:01,024
Then I'll get the stone turning
attachment for my dozer.

702
00:46:02,259 --> 00:46:03,927
Can someone please
explain it to him?

703
00:46:05,128 --> 00:46:07,764
Out of the way!
Learn to drive!

704
00:46:07,831 --> 00:46:09,766
Someone should take away
his license.

705
00:46:11,968 --> 00:46:13,937
Stop this vehicle right now!

706
00:46:14,004 --> 00:46:16,239
I'm a police dog
and you're under arrest!

707
00:46:16,306 --> 00:46:18,608
Oh, no!
You hear that, Butch?

708
00:46:18,675 --> 00:46:20,410
We're under arrest.

709
00:46:22,012 --> 00:46:24,147
Hey, why do you get
to wear the hat?

710
00:46:24,214 --> 00:46:25,715
'Cause I took
it from him!

711
00:46:25,782 --> 00:46:27,150
Well, I'm taking it
from you!

712
00:46:27,217 --> 00:46:29,953
- Give me that back, it's my hat! My hat!
- No, it's my hat!

713
00:46:31,154 --> 00:46:32,756
Hey, hands on
the wheel!

714
00:46:32,823 --> 00:46:34,357
Ahhh!

715
00:46:34,991 --> 00:46:37,127
So unprofessional!

716
00:46:47,137 --> 00:46:48,772
Quit squirming!

717
00:46:51,741 --> 00:46:54,311
Put me down!
Let me go!

718
00:46:57,247 --> 00:46:59,583
Welcome to your
new home.

719
00:47:07,357 --> 00:47:09,059
What is this place?

720
00:47:09,125 --> 00:47:11,428
It's Fuzzy Buddies
Obedience School!

721
00:47:11,495 --> 00:47:14,197
- Isn't it awesome?
- What?

722
00:47:14,264 --> 00:47:16,099
We're gonna learn
so many new tricks,

723
00:47:16,166 --> 00:47:21,137
like sit, and roll over,
and, uh, sit.

724
00:47:21,204 --> 00:47:24,441
Ugh, Barney, how many times
do I have to tell you?

725
00:47:24,508 --> 00:47:26,743
It's not
an obedience school anymore.

726
00:47:26,810 --> 00:47:29,279
Mayor Humdinger's goons
took over this place

727
00:47:29,346 --> 00:47:31,281
and turned it into a jail.

728
00:47:31,348 --> 00:47:34,317
Old Humdinger's
not exactly a dog lover.

729
00:47:34,384 --> 00:47:36,653
He's more of a cat person.

730
00:47:37,754 --> 00:47:39,890
He's rounding up all
the dogs in the city,

731
00:47:39,956 --> 00:47:41,858
and locking us
in here.

732
00:47:41,925 --> 00:47:43,326
That's terrible.

733
00:47:43,393 --> 00:47:45,195
Never let your
guard down in here.

734
00:47:45,262 --> 00:47:47,597
There's one guy you
gotta watch out for.

735
00:47:47,664 --> 00:47:51,568
He'll sneak up behind you
when you least expect it.

736
00:47:52,135 --> 00:47:53,336
There he is!

737
00:47:53,403 --> 00:47:55,772
Don't worry, guys,
I'll protect you!

738
00:47:55,839 --> 00:47:58,475
Leave my friends alone! Ow!

739
00:48:03,146 --> 00:48:05,282
He got away!

740
00:48:05,348 --> 00:48:07,484
I gotta get
out of here.

741
00:48:07,551 --> 00:48:09,419
So what's your
story, kid?

742
00:48:10,220 --> 00:48:12,355
I don't even
know anymore.

743
00:48:12,422 --> 00:48:14,658
I thought I was a member
of the PAW Patrol.

744
00:48:14,724 --> 00:48:17,260
But now I feel like they're
better off without me.

745
00:48:17,327 --> 00:48:19,496
What makes you say
a thing like that?

746
00:48:19,563 --> 00:48:23,333
I keep messing up
and letting everyone down.

747
00:48:23,400 --> 00:48:27,437
I can't even,
with all this negativity.

748
00:48:27,504 --> 00:48:30,240
Just ignore her.
She's all bark and no bite.

749
00:48:30,307 --> 00:48:32,108
Now pick yourself
a doghouse.

750
00:48:32,175 --> 00:48:33,910
You're gonna be
here awhile.

751
00:48:47,657 --> 00:48:49,192
Come on, in here!

752
00:48:50,594 --> 00:48:51,728
Liberty!

753
00:48:51,795 --> 00:48:53,063
Que gusto verte!

754
00:48:53,129 --> 00:48:54,698
How's life treating
you these days?

755
00:48:54,764 --> 00:48:56,700
Carmen, I got
no time for chitchat.

756
00:48:56,766 --> 00:48:59,035
We're in a jam
and we need your help.

757
00:48:59,102 --> 00:49:00,904
Have you seen
this dog?

758
00:49:00,971 --> 00:49:03,607
No, I haven't
seen him.

759
00:49:03,673 --> 00:49:06,810
If you want, you can put
his picture up on the wall.

760
00:49:08,812 --> 00:49:09,913
Whoa...

761
00:49:11,348 --> 00:49:14,417
Lots of dogs
going missing lately.

762
00:49:14,484 --> 00:49:16,353
I'm keeping
my eyes open

763
00:49:16,419 --> 00:49:20,190
but it's like
they just disappear.

764
00:49:20,256 --> 00:49:22,025
How long has this
been happening?

765
00:49:22,092 --> 00:49:24,127
It started
a couple days ago.

766
00:49:24,194 --> 00:49:27,097
Now, half my customers
are missing a dog.

767
00:49:27,163 --> 00:49:28,598
This can't be a coincidence.

768
00:49:28,665 --> 00:49:30,533
Somebody's got to be
taking them.

769
00:49:30,600 --> 00:49:33,103
Dog-napping?
Who would do that?

770
00:49:33,169 --> 00:49:35,338
Humdinger!
It's got to be him.

771
00:49:35,405 --> 00:49:37,374
He hates dogs
more than anything.

772
00:49:37,440 --> 00:49:39,075
But where is he
taking them?

773
00:49:39,142 --> 00:49:41,144
I think I know
how we can find out.

774
00:49:41,211 --> 00:49:42,712
- How?
- I'm a dog.

775
00:49:42,779 --> 00:49:45,248
I'm also kind of an honorary
member of the PAW Patrol,

776
00:49:45,315 --> 00:49:46,650
so I'll be
the bait.

777
00:49:46,716 --> 00:49:48,718
I get captured,
you tail me,

778
00:49:48,785 --> 00:49:51,321
and boom, we find out
where he's taking them.

779
00:49:51,388 --> 00:49:53,456
That might actually work.

780
00:49:53,523 --> 00:49:56,359
We just need to figure out how
to get Humdinger's attention.

781
00:49:56,993 --> 00:49:58,461
Leave that to me.

782
00:50:01,998 --> 00:50:05,168
Marty Muckraker here,
bringing you an exclusive interview

783
00:50:05,235 --> 00:50:07,771
with recently disgraced
Mayor Humdinger.

784
00:50:07,837 --> 00:50:08,705
Thanks, Marty.

785
00:50:08,772 --> 00:50:11,608
After today's
little subway snafu,

786
00:50:11,675 --> 00:50:13,643
I just wanted to assure
the public

787
00:50:13,710 --> 00:50:16,279
there will be no more
embarrassing mishaps.

788
00:50:16,346 --> 00:50:17,981
Ahhh!

789
00:50:18,048 --> 00:50:19,549
Put a cork in it,
windbag!

790
00:50:19,616 --> 00:50:23,253
Somebody get this filthy dog away from me!

791
00:50:24,087 --> 00:50:25,388
Gotcha!

792
00:50:27,857 --> 00:50:30,994
Oh, no!
Please! Let me go!

793
00:50:31,061 --> 00:50:34,030
Don't take me to exactly the same
place you took the other dogs,

794
00:50:34,097 --> 00:50:39,069
in this white van,
license plate number YVP 8624!

795
00:50:40,637 --> 00:50:42,305
You, with the pants
on your head,

796
00:50:42,372 --> 00:50:44,507
- get me a new pair of pants.
- Right away, sir!

797
00:50:44,574 --> 00:50:46,309
When my new pants arrive,

798
00:50:46,376 --> 00:50:48,545
we'll take this interview
from the top.

799
00:50:48,611 --> 00:50:51,448
Um... Mr. Mayor,
we're live.

800
00:50:53,950 --> 00:50:55,985
Ahhh!

801
00:50:56,052 --> 00:50:59,122
If this goes viral,
I'm canceling the Internet!

802
00:51:08,331 --> 00:51:10,200
Get back here!
I'm gonna get you!

803
00:51:18,041 --> 00:51:21,544
Was this one easier to catch,
or are we getting better at this?

804
00:51:21,611 --> 00:51:24,614
Oh-ho-ho! We're definitely
getting better at this.

805
00:51:26,449 --> 00:51:28,051
Chase? Chase?

806
00:51:28,118 --> 00:51:32,255
Anybody here seen a German Shepherd
about yay high, always saying,

807
00:51:32,322 --> 00:51:33,790
"Chase is on the case"?

808
00:51:34,224 --> 00:51:35,425
Liberty?

809
00:51:35,859 --> 00:51:37,227
Hey, buddy!

810
00:51:37,293 --> 00:51:38,928
I came to bust you
out of here.

811
00:51:38,995 --> 00:51:40,196
Puh-lease.

812
00:51:40,263 --> 00:51:44,033
This scrawny little purse pup
is going to pull a jailbreak?

813
00:51:44,100 --> 00:51:47,470
You talk a lot of trash for a dog
who looks like a toilet brush.

814
00:51:48,004 --> 00:51:49,072
Hmph!

815
00:51:49,139 --> 00:51:51,141
Come on, Chase,
get up.

816
00:51:51,207 --> 00:51:53,042
You shouldn't have
come after me.

817
00:51:53,109 --> 00:51:54,978
Now we're both
stuck in here.

818
00:51:55,044 --> 00:51:56,946
Of course
I came after you.

819
00:51:57,013 --> 00:52:01,084
I might just be one small pup,
all alone in the big city,

820
00:52:01,151 --> 00:52:03,219
but I can still
make a difference.

821
00:52:03,286 --> 00:52:06,489
I can still be a hero,
just like you.

822
00:52:08,558 --> 00:52:10,627
- I'm no hero.
- Yeah, right.

823
00:52:10,693 --> 00:52:13,196
And I'm a purebred
show dog with papers.

824
00:52:14,664 --> 00:52:17,033
Oh... You're serious.

825
00:52:17,100 --> 00:52:22,238
I used to think I was a hero,
but it turns out I'm just scared.

826
00:52:22,305 --> 00:52:25,208
So? Who cares
if you're scared?

827
00:52:25,275 --> 00:52:27,477
Heroes get scared
all the time.

828
00:52:27,544 --> 00:52:29,913
- They do?
- Of course they do.

829
00:52:29,979 --> 00:52:33,650
But even though they're scared,
they push through and keep going.

830
00:52:33,716 --> 00:52:35,752
That's what
makes them heroes.

831
00:52:38,188 --> 00:52:40,523
While you chew over that
knowledge I just dropped,

832
00:52:40,590 --> 00:52:42,525
I'm gonna get us outta here.

833
00:52:42,592 --> 00:52:44,060
We're stuck
in here, Liberty.

834
00:52:44,127 --> 00:52:47,597
That door is always locked,
and it's the only way out.

835
00:52:47,664 --> 00:52:51,067
Well, there's one thing
I forgot to mention.

836
00:52:53,236 --> 00:52:55,138
I brought backup!

837
00:52:55,205 --> 00:52:57,373
- Rubble!
- On the double!

838
00:52:57,440 --> 00:52:59,108
♪ Three, two, one, go ♪

839
00:53:00,376 --> 00:53:02,512
Yeah!

840
00:53:03,847 --> 00:53:05,114
Chase!

841
00:53:06,182 --> 00:53:08,484
- What's going on in here?
- What's going on in here?

842
00:53:09,319 --> 00:53:10,353
Get 'em!

843
00:53:10,420 --> 00:53:12,188
Charge!

844
00:53:16,326 --> 00:53:18,061
I'm gonna get ya!
I'm gonna get ya!

845
00:53:19,295 --> 00:53:20,997
Yes, we're free!

846
00:53:21,064 --> 00:53:23,233
All right, pups, let's roll.

847
00:53:23,299 --> 00:53:25,268
Chase,
you ride with me.

848
00:53:29,005 --> 00:53:31,374
- Whoa!
- You cool back there, Liberty?

849
00:53:31,441 --> 00:53:33,409
I'm doing
great! Ahhh!

850
00:53:35,211 --> 00:53:38,748
Come on, you bucket of bolts,
don't quit on me now!

851
00:53:39,515 --> 00:53:40,884
Chase and I have
to make a stop.

852
00:53:40,950 --> 00:53:42,518
We'll meet you back
at headquarters.

853
00:53:42,585 --> 00:53:44,988
Aye aye, Ryder, sir!
See you there.

854
00:53:51,227 --> 00:53:52,862
Where are we going?

855
00:53:52,929 --> 00:53:54,664
There's something
I need to show you.

856
00:53:55,865 --> 00:53:57,767
Do you remember
this place?

857
00:53:59,936 --> 00:54:02,238
This is where
I found you.

858
00:54:02,305 --> 00:54:04,774
Why would you
bring me here?

859
00:54:04,841 --> 00:54:08,278
I know this place reminds you
of the worst time in your life.

860
00:54:08,344 --> 00:54:10,480
But there's more
to it than that.

861
00:54:10,546 --> 00:54:12,548
It's also
a great place.

862
00:54:12,615 --> 00:54:14,617
I remember the first
time I saw you.

863
00:54:15,985 --> 00:54:19,555
You were a tiny little pup,
all alone in the big city.

864
00:54:34,103 --> 00:54:37,173
I know. You saw me
and took pity on me.

865
00:54:37,540 --> 00:54:38,875
Not at all.

866
00:54:38,942 --> 00:54:41,911
What I saw was a brave,
heroic pup.

867
00:54:41,978 --> 00:54:44,580
Even though you were too small
to look after yourself,

868
00:54:44,647 --> 00:54:46,749
and you were up against
all those scary things,

869
00:54:46,816 --> 00:54:49,185
you got back up
and kept going.

870
00:54:49,252 --> 00:54:52,188
I didn't adopt you
because I felt sorry for you.

871
00:54:52,255 --> 00:54:56,059
I chose you because you were
the bravest pup I'd ever seen.

872
00:54:58,962 --> 00:55:01,130
I know Adventure City
has been tough for you,

873
00:55:01,197 --> 00:55:05,601
but I also know that deep down
you were born to be a hero.

874
00:55:07,737 --> 00:55:11,174
So, what do you say?
Wanna go to work?

875
00:55:11,240 --> 00:55:13,376
Ready for action,
Ryder sir.

876
00:55:34,664 --> 00:55:36,466
Here you go, boss.

877
00:55:36,532 --> 00:55:38,401
Let's make history.

878
00:55:39,702 --> 00:55:41,337
- Mayor Humdinger!
- Ahhh!

879
00:55:41,404 --> 00:55:43,439
Don't sneak up
on me like that.

880
00:55:43,506 --> 00:55:46,042
The Cloud Catcher's
precipometer has short-circuited

881
00:55:46,109 --> 00:55:50,079
and the barometric pressure has
dropped below 87 kilopascals!

882
00:55:50,146 --> 00:55:52,482
What? I never know
what you're talking about.

883
00:55:52,548 --> 00:55:53,983
Dumb it down for me!

884
00:55:54,050 --> 00:55:57,253
We've got to bring down the Cloud
Catcher, it's gonna blow!

885
00:55:57,320 --> 00:55:59,088
Hogwash! Give me that.

886
00:56:00,623 --> 00:56:02,425
What are you doing?

887
00:56:02,492 --> 00:56:03,693
Hmm!

888
00:56:05,094 --> 00:56:07,196
There's a free-floating
meteorological

889
00:56:07,263 --> 00:56:08,931
weather containment
system overhead,

890
00:56:08,998 --> 00:56:12,001
and the anemometer readings
are off the charts!

891
00:56:12,402 --> 00:56:13,936
What?

892
00:56:14,003 --> 00:56:16,973
We're all in grave danger.

893
00:56:17,040 --> 00:56:19,375
In danger of having the time
of our lives!

894
00:56:19,442 --> 00:56:22,545
Thank you, Kendra,
for that lovely introduction.

895
00:56:22,612 --> 00:56:25,982
You're making a big mistake!

896
00:56:26,049 --> 00:56:29,152
Ladies and gentlemen,
members of the press,

897
00:56:29,218 --> 00:56:30,987
and most importantly

898
00:56:31,054 --> 00:56:33,489
influencers with over
10,000 followers,

899
00:56:33,556 --> 00:56:34,991
we are gathered here today

900
00:56:35,058 --> 00:56:38,928
for the grand opening
of Humdinger Heights!

901
00:56:42,198 --> 00:56:45,601
I took the tallest skyscraper
in Adventure City

902
00:56:45,668 --> 00:56:49,138
and stuck a brand-new tower
on top,

903
00:56:49,205 --> 00:56:54,210
turning it into the tallest
building in the world!

904
00:56:54,277 --> 00:56:57,113
And I've put my office right
at the top.

905
00:56:57,180 --> 00:56:58,915
Now you'll have
to look up to me,

906
00:56:58,981 --> 00:57:01,951
and I'll always
look down on you.

907
00:57:04,554 --> 00:57:06,422
#Humdinger!

908
00:57:38,054 --> 00:57:39,689
Oh, no!

909
00:57:45,428 --> 00:57:47,330
Marty Muckraker reporting live

910
00:57:47,396 --> 00:57:49,966
with a correction to this
morning's weather forecast.

911
00:57:50,032 --> 00:57:52,335
Instead of clear blue skies
and gentle breeze,

912
00:57:52,401 --> 00:57:56,239
it will now be pitch-black
skies and hurricane-force winds.

913
00:57:56,305 --> 00:57:57,773
Whoa!

914
00:57:57,840 --> 00:57:59,075
This just in.

915
00:57:59,142 --> 00:58:01,744
I've been lying about my hair!

916
00:58:04,881 --> 00:58:07,783
Yikes, that's
looking gnarly.

917
00:58:07,850 --> 00:58:10,453
Ahhh! Ahhh!

918
00:58:10,520 --> 00:58:12,522
- Rubble!
- What?

919
00:58:12,588 --> 00:58:14,657
Lightning is frightening!

920
00:58:16,125 --> 00:58:18,361
PAW Patrol.
What's your emergency?

921
00:58:18,427 --> 00:58:19,896
What's the emergency?

922
00:58:19,962 --> 00:58:23,799
The mesoscale convective system is
causing exponential thermal lift

923
00:58:23,866 --> 00:58:27,803
and catastrophic downbursts
at over 190 knots!

924
00:58:28,137 --> 00:58:29,505
What?

925
00:58:29,572 --> 00:58:31,007
It's a super
bad storm.

926
00:58:31,073 --> 00:58:33,042
Come on,
guys, keep up.

927
00:58:33,109 --> 00:58:35,811
Finally, somebody gets me!

928
00:58:35,878 --> 00:58:38,314
This is not a regular storm.

929
00:58:38,381 --> 00:58:40,216
It's being caused by
a weather-control device

930
00:58:40,283 --> 00:58:43,653
that's unleashing weeks' worth
of bad weather all at once!

931
00:58:43,719 --> 00:58:45,555
Take cover.
We're on our way.

932
00:58:51,561 --> 00:58:52,795
Chase...

933
00:58:52,862 --> 00:58:55,565
Ready for launch. Go!

934
00:58:59,602 --> 00:59:01,871
Marshall. Go!

935
00:59:06,475 --> 00:59:08,611
Rubble. Go!

936
00:59:11,380 --> 00:59:13,916
Rocky. Go!

937
00:59:21,390 --> 00:59:22,458
Whoo-hoo!

938
00:59:22,525 --> 00:59:24,360
Zuma. Go!

939
00:59:32,568 --> 00:59:34,337
Go get 'em, pups!

940
00:59:40,176 --> 00:59:41,711
You know, Liberty,
I've been thinking.

941
00:59:41,777 --> 00:59:45,214
You're kind of like an honorary
member of the PAW Patrol, right?

942
00:59:45,281 --> 00:59:47,516
I suppose you could say that.

943
00:59:47,583 --> 00:59:49,885
I mean, your words,
not mine.

944
00:59:49,952 --> 00:59:53,589
But to be an official member,
you'd need a faster vehicle, right?

945
00:59:54,790 --> 00:59:56,025
I know, I know,

946
00:59:56,092 --> 00:59:58,628
my ride's a rusty old
wagon with a wonky wheel

947
00:59:58,694 --> 01:00:00,596
that goes
"eee-ooo-eee-ooo-eee-ooo."

948
01:00:00,663 --> 01:00:02,465
You don't have to rub it in.

949
01:00:12,241 --> 01:00:13,276
Is that...

950
01:00:13,342 --> 01:00:15,177
It's yours.

951
01:00:15,244 --> 01:00:18,381
Okay, Liberty, play it
cool, play it cool.

952
01:00:18,447 --> 01:00:21,050
Ahhh! This is amazing! It's the greatest
thing I've ever seen in my life!

953
01:00:21,117 --> 01:00:22,618
I've never been so happy!

954
01:00:22,685 --> 01:00:24,553
It's like my whole life has been
building towards this moment!

955
01:00:24,620 --> 01:00:26,122
All my dreams have come true!

956
01:00:27,156 --> 01:00:29,859
It's so amazing!

957
01:00:38,834 --> 01:00:41,203
Looking good,
Liberty.

958
01:00:41,270 --> 01:00:43,606
Liberty!
Ready for launch.

959
01:00:43,673 --> 01:00:44,907
The voice
said my name!

960
01:00:44,974 --> 01:00:47,310
I can't believe
this is really happening!

961
01:00:47,376 --> 01:00:49,145
Five...

962
01:00:49,879 --> 01:00:52,481
Four... Three...

963
01:00:52,548 --> 01:00:54,750
Wait, I'm not sure
I'm ready for this.

964
01:00:54,817 --> 01:00:56,719
- Two...
- You might want to hang on.

965
01:00:56,786 --> 01:00:59,322

the streets are clear.

You can count on me, Ryder.

The Cloud Catcher
has gone critical.

There's no way
to bring it down!

01:02:26,108 --> 01:02:29,445

It's okay, kitties,

1037
01:05:04,333 --> 01:05:06,969
we'll just hunker down

Ryder? What are you doing here?

1040
01:05:16,845 --> 01:05:21,417
This tower isn't safe.
We've got to get you out of here.

1041
01:05:21,483 --> 01:05:25,187
Oh, no, the power's out.
That means the elevator's dead.

1042
01:05:25,254 --> 01:05:27,222
We have to go now.

1043
01:05:27,289 --> 01:05:30,225
Nice try! I'm not going
anywhere with you.

Okay, fine.
I'll go with you.

1047
01:05:41,837 --> 01:05:45,140
But I want to make it very
clear, this is not a rescue.

1048
01:05:45,207 --> 01:05:48,377
It's... Uh,
an "assisted exit."

1049
01:05:48,444 --> 01:05:49,745
You can call it
whatever you want,

1050
01:05:49,812 --> 01:05:52,147
as long as you get in the
elevator now!

1051
01:05:52,214 --> 01:05:54,083
I'll release the cables
manually from above.

1052
01:05:54,149 --> 01:05:58,020
Once I've lowered you down safely,
I'll rappel down the elevator shaft.

1053
01:05:58,687 --> 01:05:59,888
Hmpf. Show off.

1054
01:05:59,955 --> 01:06:02,458
Even though we've had our personal
differences over the years,

1055
01:06:02,524 --> 01:06:04,560
I take no pleasure
in doing this.

1056
01:06:04,627 --> 01:06:05,761
Doing what?

1057
01:06:05,828 --> 01:06:07,262
Ahhh!

1058
01:06:09,331 --> 01:06:11,934
Actually, that's
pretty satisfying.

1059
01:06:12,001 --> 01:06:16,372
One one thousand, two one thousand,
three one thousand, four one thousand,

1060
01:06:16,438 --> 01:06:17,640
five one thousand.

1061
01:06:27,282 --> 01:06:28,384
Oh, uh...

1062
01:06:28,450 --> 01:06:30,853
Nothing to worry about,
everything's fine.

1063
01:06:33,389 --> 01:06:36,525
Okay, pups, Humdinger's out!
I'm coming down.

1064
01:06:36,592 --> 01:06:39,695
Nice job, Ryder!
See you on the ground.

1065
01:06:41,430 --> 01:06:42,998
Whoa!

1066
01:06:43,399 --> 01:06:44,733
That's not good.

1067
01:06:45,467 --> 01:06:47,469
That's very not good!

1068
01:06:51,573 --> 01:06:52,741
Ahhh! Oh!

1069
01:06:52,808 --> 01:06:53,942
Whoa!

1070
01:07:10,292 --> 01:07:11,593
Ryder!

1071
01:07:26,742 --> 01:07:28,110
Arf! Shields!

1072
01:07:40,289 --> 01:07:41,790
Arf! Motorcycle!

1073
01:07:56,271 --> 01:07:57,639
Suction tires!

1074
01:08:01,443 --> 01:08:02,978
I'm coming, Ryder!

1075
01:08:27,669 --> 01:08:31,006
Ryder? Ryder?
Where are you?

1076
01:08:33,575 --> 01:08:36,645
Ryder! I can see
your light. Hang on!

1077
01:08:54,263 --> 01:08:55,998
I can do this.

1078
01:08:56,064 --> 01:08:57,432
I can do this.

1079
01:08:58,033 --> 01:08:59,935
I can do this!

1080
01:09:00,002 --> 01:09:01,703
Arf! Grappling hook!

1081
01:09:06,775 --> 01:09:07,976
Oh, no!

1082
01:09:17,419 --> 01:09:18,887
Disconnect pup pack.

1083
01:09:30,365 --> 01:09:31,600
Ryder...

1084
01:09:36,572 --> 01:09:40,776
I chose you because you
were the bravest pup I'd ever seen.

1085
01:10:09,905 --> 01:10:11,006
Ryder!

1086
01:10:17,512 --> 01:10:19,014
Ryder?

1087
01:10:19,882 --> 01:10:21,416
Chase!

1088
01:10:21,483 --> 01:10:23,952
I can't believe you found me!

1089
01:10:24,019 --> 01:10:27,256
You can always
count on me, Ryder.

1090
01:10:28,824 --> 01:10:31,026
Come on, we gotta
get out of here!

1091
01:10:31,093 --> 01:10:32,995
I can't.
I'm stuck.

1092
01:10:33,061 --> 01:10:36,131
On three, pull as hard as you can.

1093
01:10:36,198 --> 01:10:39,034
One, two, three!

1094
01:10:40,235 --> 01:10:41,970
Come on!

1095
01:10:43,138 --> 01:10:44,606
It won't budge.

1096
01:10:46,408 --> 01:10:47,843
One more try.

1097
01:11:00,355 --> 01:11:01,690
You did it!

1098
01:11:02,557 --> 01:11:04,059
We did it.

1099
01:11:05,227 --> 01:11:06,962
I told you
you were a hero.

1100
01:11:07,029 --> 01:11:09,031
Now come on.
Let's get out of here.

1101
01:11:15,671 --> 01:11:17,606
Just a little bit further.

1102
01:11:21,243 --> 01:11:22,778
Whoa.

1103
01:11:28,417 --> 01:11:30,319
Oh, great. Lightning.

1104
01:11:34,356 --> 01:11:35,724
Arf! Net!

1105
01:11:39,361 --> 01:11:40,829
Target acquired.

1106
01:11:41,163 --> 01:11:42,297
Fire!

1107
01:11:44,199 --> 01:11:45,701
Got it!

1108
01:11:47,469 --> 01:11:48,503
Whoa!

1109
01:11:48,570 --> 01:11:50,038
Don't got it!

1110
01:11:51,106 --> 01:11:53,809
Warning. Warning. Warning.

1111
01:11:53,875 --> 01:11:56,011
Come on, baby, turn it around!

1112
01:12:09,491 --> 01:12:11,259
Okay, Cloud Catcher...

1113
01:12:11,326 --> 01:12:12,661
Catch this!

1114
01:12:20,936 --> 01:12:21,937
Eject!

1115
01:12:31,980 --> 01:12:33,148
What's that?

1116
01:12:34,750 --> 01:12:37,853
Whoo-hoo!

1117
01:12:50,732 --> 01:12:53,668
- Yay, Skye!
- Awesome!

1118
01:12:56,304 --> 01:12:57,806
Whoa!

1119
01:12:58,373 --> 01:12:59,908
Good job, Skye!

1120
01:12:59,975 --> 01:13:01,710
That was
totally awesome!

1121
01:13:01,777 --> 01:13:03,678
You're definitely
my favorite pup.

1122
01:13:03,745 --> 01:13:06,415
I hope Ryder got insurance
on my 'copter.

1123
01:13:10,919 --> 01:13:12,721
That'll buff
right out.

1124
01:13:18,393 --> 01:13:20,929
- He's okay!
- All right!

1125
01:13:20,996 --> 01:13:22,464
Yeah!

1126
01:13:24,032 --> 01:13:26,301
Okay, okay.
Give him some air.

1127
01:13:29,304 --> 01:13:30,839
How do you feel?

1128
01:13:31,373 --> 01:13:33,408
Covered in drool.

1129
01:13:33,475 --> 01:13:35,644
I can't help it,
I'm a bulldog.

1130
01:13:35,710 --> 01:13:37,913
My tongue is too big
for my mouth!

1131
01:13:37,979 --> 01:13:39,047
See?

1132
01:13:45,253 --> 01:13:46,688
You did good, pups.

1133
01:13:54,930 --> 01:13:57,265
Time for me
to get out of here!

1134
01:13:58,633 --> 01:14:01,002
Hey! Mayor Humdinger!

1135
01:14:03,004 --> 01:14:05,640
You are under arrest
for gross negligence,

1136
01:14:05,707 --> 01:14:08,176
public endangerment,
and dog-napping!

1137
01:14:08,243 --> 01:14:11,213
You can't arrest me,
I'm the mayor!

1138
01:14:13,181 --> 01:14:16,885
- He's getting away!
- Arf! Mini-drone!

1139
01:14:26,061 --> 01:14:27,062
Ahhh!

1140
01:14:27,129 --> 01:14:29,231
Hey, hey, hey!

1141
01:14:32,567 --> 01:14:34,136
Put me down!

1142
01:14:34,202 --> 01:14:37,372
Nobody makes a fool of Mayor
Humdinger five times in the same day!

1143
01:14:37,439 --> 01:14:39,107
Ahhh!

1144
01:14:42,444 --> 01:14:45,180
Well, this is humiliating.

1145
01:14:45,247 --> 01:14:46,815
Here you go, boss.

1146
01:14:47,516 --> 01:14:49,017
That's better.

1147
01:14:52,020 --> 01:14:54,322
Adventure City
is our home.

1148
01:14:54,389 --> 01:14:57,292
It's up to all of us
to take care of it.

1149
01:15:02,731 --> 01:15:05,333
But once in a while,
a group of heroes

1150
01:15:05,400 --> 01:15:08,737
go above and beyond
the call of duty.

1151
01:15:08,803 --> 01:15:10,839
They look out
for their neighbors

1152
01:15:10,906 --> 01:15:13,241
before they look out
for themselves.

1153
01:15:13,308 --> 01:15:17,379
And they're so darn cute,
I just want to squeeze 'em!

1154
01:15:17,445 --> 01:15:21,650
It is our great honor to present
the key to Adventure City to...

1155
01:15:21,716 --> 01:15:23,685
- The PAW Patrol!
- The PAW Patrol!

1156
01:15:33,895 --> 01:15:37,532
Me and the PAW Patrol,
we go way back!

1157
01:15:38,800 --> 01:15:42,237
And to think I knew them
before they were famous!

1158
01:15:42,304 --> 01:15:45,440
Hey, Rubble,
I got something for you.

1159
01:15:48,643 --> 01:15:51,213
I am never taking this off!

1160
01:15:52,581 --> 01:15:55,050
I want to take this special
occasion to introduce you

1161
01:15:55,116 --> 01:15:57,452
to the newest member
of the PAW Patrol.

1162
01:15:57,519 --> 01:15:59,354
Adventure City's very own...

1163
01:15:59,421 --> 01:16:00,922
Liberty!

1164
01:16:09,631 --> 01:16:11,533
My own pup tag?

1165
01:16:11,600 --> 01:16:13,501
Welcome to
the family, Liberty.

1166
01:16:14,569 --> 01:16:15,737
I'm official.

1167
01:16:15,804 --> 01:16:18,306
Hey, check it out!
I'm officially official!

1168
01:16:18,373 --> 01:16:21,576
Official member of the
PAW Patrol right here!

1169
01:16:26,715 --> 01:16:28,083
Thank you for this honor.

1170
01:16:28,149 --> 01:16:31,486
The PAW Patrol will always
look out for Adventure City.

1171
01:16:31,553 --> 01:16:34,956
Remember, if you're ever
in trouble, just yelp for...

1172
01:16:37,225 --> 01:16:39,227
Ugh. That's so embarrassing.

1173
01:16:39,294 --> 01:16:41,129
I thought I had
this thing on silent.

1174
01:16:41,196 --> 01:16:44,633
Ryder! Something big is
going down at the waterfront.

1175
01:16:44,699 --> 01:16:46,268
We need the PAW Patrol!

1176
01:16:48,136 --> 01:16:51,139

action, Ryder sir!
