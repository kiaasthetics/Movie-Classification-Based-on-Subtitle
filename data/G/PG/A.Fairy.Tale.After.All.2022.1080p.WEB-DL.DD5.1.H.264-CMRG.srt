Dad?

3
00:00:27,912 --> 00:00:30,280
It's me, Sky.

4
00:00:30,314 --> 00:00:31,816
I've come to bring you home.

5
00:00:33,885 --> 00:00:35,118
Is that you?

6
00:00:37,622 --> 00:00:41,458
Jack fell
down and broke his crown

7
00:00:41,491 --> 00:00:45,395
and Jill came tumbling after.

Beautiful.

16
00:01:44,956 --> 00:01:48,860
You are perfect,
my young one.

17
00:01:54,498 --> 00:01:59,236
You have chosen courage
over fear.

18
00:02:04,709 --> 00:02:06,243
Once upon a time,

19
00:02:06,276 --> 00:02:09,546
in a faraway land known
as The Kingdom of the Sky,

20
00:02:09,580 --> 00:02:11,916
there was a beloved young girl
who possessed a grace

21
00:02:11,949 --> 00:02:15,753
that comes only from having
a loving heart.

22
00:02:15,787 --> 00:02:18,723
However, with the sudden death
of her father, the king,

23
00:02:18,756 --> 00:02:21,324
the heir was denied
her childhood,

24
00:02:21,358 --> 00:02:23,427
and as fate would have it,
destined

25
00:02:23,460 --> 00:02:25,395
to care for her adolescent
brother

26
00:02:25,429 --> 00:02:26,664
and the kingdom all alone.

27
00:02:27,598 --> 00:02:29,667
As the months passed,

28
00:02:29,701 --> 00:02:32,536
the melancholy beauty found
herself unfit to reign,

29
00:02:32,570 --> 00:02:35,338
and took shelter in the north
tower of the castle,

30
00:02:35,372 --> 00:02:38,241
securing all entries
and windows.

31
00:02:38,275 --> 00:02:40,912
Even with the persistent pleads
from her handmaiden,

32
00:02:40,945 --> 00:02:43,748
there was no convincing
the stubborn queen-to-be.

33
00:02:54,025 --> 00:02:55,525
Now, you're probably
questioning,

34
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:57,327
how did she stay nourished?

35
00:02:59,564 --> 00:03:01,298
By tiptoeing.

36
00:03:01,933 --> 00:03:04,969
Even a self-barricaded could not
stand in the way

37
00:03:05,002 --> 00:03:07,805
between the princess and
the strawberry short pies.

38
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:17,915
Restless from months
of hiding,

39
00:03:17,949 --> 00:03:20,785
she ultimately chose fear
over courage,

40
00:03:20,818 --> 00:03:23,654
and decided to abandon
her kingdom for the new life.

00:03:23,688 --> 00:03:25,990

by the time you read
this letter,

76
00:05:17,668 --> 00:05:19,804
I'll be gone
from the palace square.

77
00:05:19,837 --> 00:05:22,139
Please don't come find me.

78
00:05:22,173 --> 00:05:25,576
I will be far, far away.

79
00:05:25,610 --> 00:05:28,946
No longer your princess,
Geneva.

80
00:05:31,949 --> 00:05:35,452
She was to depart the
evening prior to her Coronation day,

81
00:05:35,485 --> 00:05:37,655
when the royal queen Tiara
was to be bestowed

82
00:05:37,688 --> 00:05:40,490
upon the coming-of-age
princess.

83
00:05:40,523 --> 00:05:44,527
However, impending on her plan
was a mysterious beam of light

84
00:05:44,562 --> 00:05:46,664
which glimmered through
her window.

85
00:05:46,697 --> 00:05:49,600
The peculiar illumination
became so powerful,

86
00:05:49,634 --> 00:05:53,070
it shattered Geneva's window
into glass splinters.

87
00:05:53,104 --> 00:05:55,538
Magically appearing
from the brilliance was

88
00:05:55,573 --> 00:05:57,540
a ghastly, evil sorceress.

89
00:05:59,176 --> 00:06:01,078
Madame Mizrabel seized Geneva

90
00:06:01,112 --> 00:06:03,881
and brought her far,
far away from the kingdom,

91
00:06:03,915 --> 00:06:07,785
her friends, and her family,

92
00:06:07,818 --> 00:06:10,755
to a dark, secluded windmill

93
00:06:10,788 --> 00:06:14,457
where nobody, not even
a willing soul, would find her,

94
00:06:14,491 --> 00:06:17,862
just as she once desired.

95
00:06:17,895 --> 00:06:19,163
As the years passed,

96
00:06:19,196 --> 00:06:22,033
the Kingdom of Celestia fell
into despair,

97
00:06:22,066 --> 00:06:24,635
as they grieved over
their missing princess,

98
00:06:24,669 --> 00:06:27,571
as she lived out her remaining
years in solitude

99
00:06:27,605 --> 00:06:30,207
with other rebellious
children,

100
00:06:30,241 --> 00:06:32,777
for all eternity.

101
00:06:50,127 --> 00:06:52,163
I can't find my keys!

102
00:06:54,966 --> 00:06:58,002
- Sky, did you see 'em?
- Nope.

103
00:06:58,035 --> 00:06:59,870
Sky, you shouldn't be eating
all that sugar.

104
00:06:59,904 --> 00:07:02,505
- It causes acne.
- But I like it.

105
00:07:02,539 --> 00:07:04,175
Can you make Brax waffles
or something?

106
00:07:04,208 --> 00:07:05,977
Oh, Brax.

107
00:07:06,010 --> 00:07:07,678
Give me my phone.

108
00:07:07,712 --> 00:07:10,982
I just prefer not to be trending
on social this morning.

109
00:07:11,015 --> 00:07:12,216
- It's for me.
- Brax.

110
00:07:12,249 --> 00:07:14,185
Give it.

111
00:07:14,218 --> 00:07:16,020
But I won't remember what
you look like when you're dead.

112
00:07:20,624 --> 00:07:23,027
They didn't just poof,
disappear,

113
00:07:23,060 --> 00:07:24,996
'cause I just had them
in my hand.

114
00:07:25,029 --> 00:07:25,997
What was it that
you're looking for?

115
00:07:26,030 --> 00:07:27,565
My keys.

116
00:07:27,598 --> 00:07:29,700
- Mom.
- Oh!

117
00:07:33,838 --> 00:07:36,240
I'm losing it, kids.

118
00:07:36,273 --> 00:07:37,675
Okay.

119
00:07:37,708 --> 00:07:38,809
How do I look?

120
00:07:38,843 --> 00:07:40,011
Legit?

121
00:07:40,044 --> 00:07:41,245
So legit.

122
00:07:41,278 --> 00:07:43,681
So classy, at 06:00 am.

123
00:07:43,714 --> 00:07:45,249
- Oh.
- New skirt.

124
00:07:47,752 --> 00:07:49,854
Don't forget, we're celebrating
Brax's birthday at...

125
00:07:49,887 --> 00:07:51,222
- I'm on it.
- Good luck.

126
00:07:52,757 --> 00:07:54,325
Again.

127
00:07:55,026 --> 00:07:56,260
Don't do this, Mom.

128
00:07:57,261 --> 00:07:58,896
Brax!

129
00:07:58,929 --> 00:08:00,331
She promised me she'd be there.

130
00:08:00,364 --> 00:08:01,999
She has to work late tonight.

131
00:08:02,033 --> 00:08:04,869
You always stick up for her!

132
00:08:04,902 --> 00:08:06,103
Mom is going through a...

133
00:08:06,137 --> 00:08:07,271
Hey.

134
00:08:07,304 --> 00:08:09,640
You are being a selfish brat.

135
00:08:12,109 --> 00:08:13,543
Let me go.

136
00:08:19,183 --> 00:08:20,818
What're you gonna do,
walk home?

137
00:08:22,253 --> 00:08:23,854
Hey, wait up.

138
00:08:25,890 --> 00:08:26,590
Sorry.

139
00:08:27,525 --> 00:08:29,193
But who's
gonna take me to school,

140
00:08:29,226 --> 00:08:31,062
and take me to Scouts?

141
00:08:31,796 --> 00:08:35,733
Who's gonna make me waffles
and tell me stories?

142
00:08:35,766 --> 00:08:38,202
Mom and I are
gonna take care of you.

143
00:08:38,235 --> 00:08:40,671
I don't like your waffles.

144
00:08:40,704 --> 00:08:42,273
I can tell stories.

145
00:08:59,356 --> 00:09:01,692

146
00:09:03,327 --> 00:09:05,062
It's gonna be okay.

00:12:07,011 --> 00:12:08,445
- Poor thing.
- So, I know I'm early,

181
00:12:08,479 --> 00:12:09,947
but the kids don't seem to be
in the classroom.

182
00:12:09,980 --> 00:12:11,181
Oh.

183
00:12:11,215 --> 00:12:13,450
How is your mom?

184
00:12:13,484 --> 00:12:16,987
Is she doing okay
in that little cabin?

185
00:12:17,021 --> 00:12:19,123
House? Chalet?

186
00:12:19,156 --> 00:12:20,457
- Day by day.
- Yeah.

187
00:12:20,491 --> 00:12:22,226
And you?

188
00:12:22,259 --> 00:12:25,329
The more you talk about it,
the more people act weird.

189
00:12:25,362 --> 00:12:27,364
Oh, weird?

190
00:12:27,398 --> 00:12:30,434
Just what's weird about
something like that?

191
00:12:30,467 --> 00:12:33,003
They don't wanna talk to you
at all?

192
00:12:33,037 --> 00:12:34,104
You look awful.

193
00:12:35,372 --> 00:12:37,308
Have you been taking care
of yourself?

194
00:12:37,341 --> 00:12:38,375
I haven't been sleeping well,
that's all.

195
00:12:38,409 --> 00:12:40,210
Ms. Murphy, I love you!

196
00:12:40,244 --> 00:12:42,379
Harrison! Ford!

197
00:12:42,413 --> 00:12:43,380
Let it out.

198
00:12:43,414 --> 00:12:45,015
They're such a hoot.

199
00:12:45,049 --> 00:12:46,383
I think I love you.

200
00:12:46,417 --> 00:12:47,418
Oh.

201
00:12:49,621 --> 00:12:52,122
Are you looking for Brax?

202
00:12:52,156 --> 00:12:55,159
I believe there was a puppet
show back in the auditorium.

203
00:12:55,192 --> 00:12:57,061
You know, like dolls.

204
00:12:57,094 --> 00:12:58,195
Just some kiddie things.

205
00:13:01,298 --> 00:13:04,335
It's me,
Granny, Little Red Riding Hood.

Okay.

208
00:13:10,974 --> 00:13:12,910
But Granny,
you don't look so good.

209
00:13:12,943 --> 00:13:14,945
And your throat sounds so sore.

210
00:13:16,013 --> 00:13:19,883
Oh, and what big eyes you have.

211
00:13:22,587 --> 00:13:24,088
Wow.

212
00:13:27,592 --> 00:13:30,427

closer so that I can eat...

213
00:13:31,495 --> 00:13:34,064
I mean, hear you better.

214
00:13:34,098 --> 00:13:35,532
Okay.

215
00:13:35,567 --> 00:13:38,369
Oh, Granny,

216
00:13:38,402 --> 00:13:42,306
what big ears you have.

217
00:13:44,341 --> 00:13:46,176
You ever feel like you're
missing out on something,

218
00:13:46,210 --> 00:13:47,311
you orange fluff?

219
00:13:47,344 --> 00:13:49,446
Yes.

220
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:51,583
- Say what?
- Always!

221
00:13:51,616 --> 00:13:53,550
I thought so.

222
00:13:53,585 --> 00:13:55,919
I have an identity crisis, okay?

223
00:13:55,953 --> 00:14:00,424
I don't know if I'm a dog, cat,
a fox, a rat!

224
00:14:05,429 --> 00:14:08,265

in fairy tales,

225
00:14:08,298 --> 00:14:10,367

Of course.

385
00:23:02,733 --> 00:23:04,869
And why do you keep calling me
"Thy Highness"?

386
00:23:04,902 --> 00:23:07,872
'Cause thou art Princess Geneva
of Celestia.

387
00:23:09,240 --> 00:23:11,508
And what're you, a dog?

388
00:23:11,541 --> 00:23:12,576
- A cat?
- Huh?

389
00:23:12,610 --> 00:23:14,812
A fox? A rat?

390
00:23:14,845 --> 00:23:16,781
Oy.

391
00:23:16,814 --> 00:23:17,949
Identity crisis.

392
00:23:19,549 --> 00:23:21,619
"A period of uncertainty
and confusion"

393
00:23:21,652 --> 00:23:24,021
"in which a person's sense of
identity becomes insecure,"

394
00:23:24,055 --> 00:23:25,990
"due to a lack of feeling
accepted,"

395
00:23:26,023 --> 00:23:28,025
"and/or needed in helping
to contribute"

396
00:23:28,059 --> 00:23:30,161
"to his/her society,
and/or situation."

397
00:23:33,564 --> 00:23:35,266
I'm a misfit who felt useless.

398
00:23:35,299 --> 00:23:37,868
And because of that conundrum,
I'm here with the rest.

399
00:23:39,103 --> 00:23:41,906
But, why am I here?

400
00:23:41,939 --> 00:23:43,908
Well, The Madame, of course.

401
00:23:43,941 --> 00:23:45,109
The Madame?

402
00:23:48,779 --> 00:23:51,115
Master Willow sets the rules.

403
00:23:51,148 --> 00:23:53,784
- Master Willow?
- Mhm.

404
00:23:53,818 --> 00:23:55,553
He's the one in command.

405
00:23:55,586 --> 00:23:57,188
Madame Mizrabel is just...

406
00:24:01,292 --> 00:24:02,259
A witch?

407
00:24:03,227 --> 00:24:03,961
Ta-da!

408
00:24:03,995 --> 00:24:06,697
Oh. Yay!

409
00:24:06,731 --> 00:24:09,233
I love campfire stories.

410
00:24:09,266 --> 00:24:12,136
Well then grab some popcorn,
you'll love this one.

411
00:24:12,169 --> 00:24:14,171
As legend has
it, before "Mizrabel",

412
00:24:14,205 --> 00:24:15,906
she went by the name "Lohr",

413
00:24:15,940 --> 00:24:18,209
a mysterious
but beautiful young woman

414
00:24:18,242 --> 00:24:21,579
who sold her soul to the spirits
of the More Black Forest,

415
00:24:21,612 --> 00:24:24,582
in exchange for the power
to work black magic.

416
00:24:24,615 --> 00:24:26,083
Black magic?

417
00:24:26,117 --> 00:24:28,185
With her wicked
husband, Hektor,

418
00:24:28,219 --> 00:24:30,021
Mizrabel used these spells
to take over

419
00:24:30,054 --> 00:24:32,923
Celestia's neighboring kingdom,
Kevawit,

420
00:24:32,957 --> 00:24:34,992
turning its people against
one another,

421
00:24:35,026 --> 00:24:38,996
all out of fear that
she would be dethroned.

422
00:24:39,030 --> 00:24:42,767
Once the spirits realized
the betrayal of using the magic

423
00:24:42,800 --> 00:24:46,337
for fear and greed,
the spirits found her

424
00:24:46,370 --> 00:24:48,072
and...

425
00:24:49,707 --> 00:24:52,743
...just as Lohr was about to
take her last breath,

426
00:24:52,777 --> 00:24:58,082
Master Willow found her
and offered her a second chance.

427
00:24:58,115 --> 00:25:00,117
But this time,
Willow would make sure

428
00:25:00,151 --> 00:25:02,186
that her beauty
would be no more,

429
00:25:02,219 --> 00:25:05,656
thus preventing her from being
any part of the outside world,

430
00:25:05,689 --> 00:25:08,159
forced to be a servant
to the master himself,

431
00:25:08,192 --> 00:25:10,795
for all time.

432
00:25:12,696 --> 00:25:14,331
Oh! And I forgot to mention
the best part!

433
00:25:14,365 --> 00:25:16,233
Willow turned her husband Hektor
into an Elgebrun Hawk Owl.

434
00:25:16,267 --> 00:25:17,635
The end!

435
00:25:17,668 --> 00:25:18,235
Wait.

436
00:25:18,269 --> 00:25:21,005
So, I'm a princess, yeah?

437
00:25:21,038 --> 00:25:22,706
Mhm.

438
00:25:23,741 --> 00:25:25,176
I am a princess?

439
00:25:27,278 --> 00:25:30,614
- I am a princess!
- Yeah.

440
00:25:30,648 --> 00:25:31,982
- I am a princess!
- All right, pull it in.

441
00:25:32,016 --> 00:25:32,616
Reel it in.

442
00:25:32,650 --> 00:25:33,584
Come on.

443
00:25:37,321 --> 00:25:39,623
And so, good morrow,

444
00:25:39,657 --> 00:25:41,258
to our waking souls,

445
00:25:41,292 --> 00:25:43,861
which watch not one another
out of fear...

446
00:25:43,894 --> 00:25:45,896
For love,
all love of other sights,

447
00:25:45,930 --> 00:25:47,631
controls and makes one
little room and...

448
00:25:47,665 --> 00:25:49,233
Who are you?

449
00:25:49,266 --> 00:25:50,935
And how did you get in here?

450
00:25:52,736 --> 00:25:55,039
A new introduction may be
in order.

451
00:25:55,072 --> 00:25:58,309
Thy Highness, meeteth Cornelis,
my partner.

452
00:25:58,342 --> 00:26:02,847
Corny, meet Princess Geneva
of Celestia,

453
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:05,382
as if you needed me
to tell you that.

454
00:26:05,416 --> 00:26:06,250
Hmm.

455
00:26:11,722 --> 00:26:13,991
Meanwhile,
a few chambers away,

456
00:26:14,024 --> 00:26:16,160
looking after
the cache of children

457
00:26:16,193 --> 00:26:17,862
Mizrabel struggled
to keep her end

458
00:26:17,895 --> 00:26:19,730
of the bargain
with Master Willow,

459
00:26:19,763 --> 00:26:22,099
and fought the urge to keep
Celestia and the princess

460
00:26:22,133 --> 00:26:23,300
all to herself.

461
00:26:25,870 --> 00:26:27,104
It's about to storm.

462
00:26:27,138 --> 00:26:28,706
Marvelous!

463
00:26:28,739 --> 00:26:31,175
Some excitement around
this joint.

464
00:26:31,208 --> 00:26:33,777
This windmill
is as still as death!

465
00:26:33,811 --> 00:26:35,079
Yes.

466
00:26:35,112 --> 00:26:36,780
Ain't it grand?

467
00:26:36,814 --> 00:26:39,216
I'm coming down with a cold.

468
00:26:39,250 --> 00:26:40,918
I know it.

469
00:26:40,951 --> 00:26:45,055
That's why my... my...
my...

470
00:26:46,790 --> 00:26:48,459
Silence, thy foul thing!

471
00:26:48,492 --> 00:26:51,695
But, but Madame,
I can't help the sneeze.

472
00:26:51,729 --> 00:26:52,930
That's a biological thing...

473
00:26:52,963 --> 00:26:57,468
My dear, faithful Hektor,
have you ever had

474
00:26:57,501 --> 00:27:01,906
something near claw's grasp
and couldn't touch it?

475
00:27:01,939 --> 00:27:03,774
Do you have any idea
how hard it is

476
00:27:03,807 --> 00:27:05,843
to wipe my beak
with these things?

477
00:27:05,876 --> 00:27:08,078
They're not practical when
needin' to reach

478
00:27:08,112 --> 00:27:10,247
for certain areas,
if you know what I...

479
00:27:10,281 --> 00:27:12,183
I'm hungry, Hektor.

480
00:27:12,216 --> 00:27:14,919
I'm hungry for a royal heart.

481
00:27:14,952 --> 00:27:17,188
A beating, royal heart.

482
00:27:17,221 --> 00:27:18,989
A princess heart?

483
00:27:19,023 --> 00:27:21,425
Well certainly not that
repulsive clod, Cornelis,

484
00:27:21,458 --> 00:27:23,994
and his bag of pelage.

485
00:27:24,028 --> 00:27:26,430
It's been torture having
her flesh so close.

486
00:27:26,463 --> 00:27:28,766
But, yet so...

487
00:27:28,799 --> 00:27:31,402
so... so far.

488
00:27:35,472 --> 00:27:38,042
I just can't stand it.

489
00:27:38,075 --> 00:27:39,944
I want to her
on my thriving dinner plate.

490
00:27:39,977 --> 00:27:41,478
Is that so much to ask?

491
00:27:41,512 --> 00:27:43,347
The only one who will be
feasting

492
00:27:43,380 --> 00:27:45,816
from a gold plate
is Master Willow.

493
00:27:45,849 --> 00:27:47,785
- Pardon?
- Think about it.

494
00:27:47,818 --> 00:27:49,520
We've been at his beck
an' call,

495
00:27:49,554 --> 00:27:51,989
holdin' this mill up
for how long now?

496
00:27:52,022 --> 00:27:52,691
And for what?

497
00:27:52,723 --> 00:27:55,192
So one day he can rule Celestia?

498
00:27:55,226 --> 00:27:56,193
Where does that leave us?

499
00:27:58,429 --> 00:28:00,798

I win.

510
00:29:52,509 --> 00:29:54,378
How many times do I have to tell
you, Princess,

511
00:29:54,411 --> 00:29:56,046
never, ever confront the...

512
00:29:56,080 --> 00:29:58,315
The fourth wall, yes, yes,
I know.

513
00:29:58,349 --> 00:29:59,917
Never again, I swear that...

514
00:29:59,950 --> 00:30:02,019
D... don't swear.

515
00:30:02,052 --> 00:30:02,754
No bad words.

516
00:30:02,787 --> 00:30:04,288
This is a family-friendly tale.

517
00:30:04,321 --> 00:30:05,889
Mhm.

518
00:30:05,923 --> 00:30:07,424
And, need I remind you that
we are all being held

519
00:30:07,458 --> 00:30:09,326
against our will here.

520
00:30:09,360 --> 00:30:11,195
And without an audience,
I might add.

521
00:30:11,228 --> 00:30:13,030
Then why aren't you two doing
something about it?

522
00:30:13,063 --> 00:30:13,897
Hmm.

523
00:30:13,931 --> 00:30:14,666
Come what may.

524
00:30:14,699 --> 00:30:16,433
Bat incoming!

525
00:30:19,303 --> 00:30:20,537
Why?

526
00:30:20,572 --> 00:30:22,272
I did a whole song and dance
and everything!

527
00:30:22,306 --> 00:30:24,041
She doesn't get
the timing thing.

528
00:30:24,074 --> 00:30:26,143
At least I'm doing something,
unlike you two,

529
00:30:26,176 --> 00:30:28,512
playing...
whatever it is you're playing.

530
00:30:28,545 --> 00:30:31,649
It's called,
"Oh, Fiddlesticks."

531
00:30:31,683 --> 00:30:33,450
"Oh, Fiddlesticks?"

532
00:30:33,484 --> 00:30:35,986
Glad to see there's no lack of
optimism in this chamber.

533
00:30:36,019 --> 00:30:37,921
Are you not bored?

534
00:30:37,955 --> 00:30:42,092
Don't you two wanna get out
and experience the world?

535
00:30:42,126 --> 00:30:43,160
Some adventure?

536
00:30:43,193 --> 00:30:44,428
Mhm.

537
00:30:44,461 --> 00:30:46,330
This is a fairy tale, after all.

538
00:30:47,599 --> 00:30:50,668
The world you come from
must be so dull.

539
00:30:50,702 --> 00:30:52,637
I wouldn't say dull.

540
00:30:52,670 --> 00:30:54,171
It is different.

541
00:30:55,707 --> 00:30:57,441
Put yourself in my shoes.

542
00:30:58,142 --> 00:30:59,343
Yay, dress-up!

543
00:30:59,376 --> 00:31:00,678
Can I be Cleopatra?

544
00:31:00,712 --> 00:31:01,679
Can I be a knight?

545
00:31:01,713 --> 00:31:03,981
What, may I ask, are you doing?

546
00:31:04,014 --> 00:31:05,182
Well, you're obviously offended

547
00:31:05,215 --> 00:31:06,584
that we didn't ask you
to participate

548
00:31:06,618 --> 00:31:08,085
in our little game, so,
Princess,

549
00:31:08,118 --> 00:31:09,086
I'm trying to remedy
the situation

550
00:31:09,119 --> 00:31:11,155
by playing whatever it is
you want me to play.

551
00:31:11,188 --> 00:31:12,690
But I might add,
that I do not believe

552
00:31:12,724 --> 00:31:14,425
that these are going to fit,
and it stops at the shoes.

553
00:31:14,458 --> 00:31:15,526
I'm not...

554
00:31:15,560 --> 00:31:16,594
Can I be The Rock?

555
00:31:16,628 --> 00:31:19,163
I just don't understand you.

556
00:31:19,196 --> 00:31:20,097
Can I be a caveman?

557
00:31:20,130 --> 00:31:21,398
So...

558
00:31:22,199 --> 00:31:24,101
...you're the knight
in shining armor?

559
00:31:29,540 --> 00:31:30,340
No.

560
00:31:30,374 --> 00:31:31,008
I'm an...

561
00:31:31,041 --> 00:31:33,177
- Oh, no.
- Yes?

562
00:31:34,746 --> 00:31:36,113
An Alpaca herder.

563
00:31:36,146 --> 00:31:36,980
There, I said it.

564
00:31:37,014 --> 00:31:37,682
Go ahead and laugh.

565
00:31:39,116 --> 00:31:40,050
An Alpaca herder?

566
00:31:41,285 --> 00:31:44,154
How does an Alpaca herder
end up here?

567
00:31:44,188 --> 00:31:45,690
No.
No-no, you're laughing.

568
00:31:48,726 --> 00:31:49,393
I won't laugh.

569
00:31:49,426 --> 00:31:50,227
I promise.

570
00:31:51,663 --> 00:31:53,096
They're so cute,

571
00:31:53,130 --> 00:31:54,632
and they've such infectious
personalities.

572
00:31:54,666 --> 00:31:55,532
They just...

573
00:31:58,435 --> 00:31:59,436
...don't like me.

574
00:32:02,907 --> 00:32:04,609
I'm not laughing. Really.

575
00:32:27,799 --> 00:32:29,399
- Your Majesty!
- What?

576
00:32:32,202 --> 00:32:33,303
My name is Cassidy.

577
00:32:33,337 --> 00:32:34,639
Cassidy Lemon.

578
00:32:34,672 --> 00:32:36,473
Mom and Dad used to call me
Chickpea.

579
00:32:36,507 --> 00:32:37,809
Nice to meet you.

580
00:32:37,842 --> 00:32:39,142
This is Bear Claw.

581
00:32:41,445 --> 00:32:42,647
No, he's nice.

582
00:32:42,680 --> 00:32:44,281
You're the king, right?

583
00:32:44,314 --> 00:32:45,215
I have, uh...

584
00:32:47,351 --> 00:32:48,452
I've seen better days.

585
00:32:48,485 --> 00:32:50,387
Me, too. Look at me.

586
00:32:51,522 --> 00:32:53,156
Why so blue?

587
00:32:53,190 --> 00:32:56,326
I was able to squeeze in between
the bars of my cell.

588
00:32:56,360 --> 00:32:59,229
And I wanted to bring
back some food for my friends.

589
00:32:59,263 --> 00:33:01,131
Like, some strawberry short pies

590
00:33:01,164 --> 00:33:03,267
or maybe some drinks
or something like that.

591
00:33:03,300 --> 00:33:05,502
I don't know. I thought I was
bringing back Bavarian Cream,

592
00:33:05,536 --> 00:33:06,704
but I was wrong.

593
00:33:06,738 --> 00:33:08,305
Wrong?

594
00:33:08,338 --> 00:33:10,307
Luckily, I took a sip before
giving it to the others.

595
00:33:10,340 --> 00:33:12,844
It was one of Madame's magic
spells!

596
00:33:12,877 --> 00:33:15,780
I do say,
you're in good spirits,

597
00:33:15,813 --> 00:33:18,783
considering the most irregular
of circumstances.

598
00:33:18,816 --> 00:33:20,150
Oh, yeah.

599
00:33:20,183 --> 00:33:21,084
I try to stay positive.

600
00:33:21,118 --> 00:33:22,185
You know how it is?

601
00:33:22,219 --> 00:33:23,387
Although,
I should've known better

602
00:33:23,420 --> 00:33:24,656
when it started to talk to me.

603
00:33:24,689 --> 00:33:27,592
Drink me, Cassidy Lemon!

604
00:33:27,625 --> 00:33:29,561
Drink me!

605
00:33:29,594 --> 00:33:32,129
Friends say it only lasts
a few hours.

606
00:33:32,162 --> 00:33:35,399
Although they also said slugs
have four noses.

607
00:33:35,432 --> 00:33:38,101
You see that ambitious
Gulliver's Travelers over there?

608
00:33:40,705 --> 00:33:43,708
That 12-foot tall octopus man?

609
00:33:43,741 --> 00:33:47,511
That 12-foot tall octopus man
has something we want.

610
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:51,148
I like the way you think, Kingy.

611
00:33:51,181 --> 00:33:52,717
I told you he'd help.

612
00:33:54,619 --> 00:33:57,555
Did you know giraffes
have no vocal cords?

613
00:33:57,589 --> 00:33:59,557
She's gonna fall.

614
00:33:59,591 --> 00:34:00,524
She's gonna fall.

615
00:34:00,558 --> 00:34:03,260
Princesses never give up!

616
00:34:03,293 --> 00:34:04,361
Whoopsie.

617
00:34:04,394 --> 00:34:05,495
Oo, that looks like it hurt!

618
00:34:06,530 --> 00:34:07,497
Hmm?

619
00:34:12,169 --> 00:34:15,272
This is the way things work
around here.

620
00:34:15,305 --> 00:34:18,576
Nothing is ever permanent,
'til it is.

621
00:34:18,610 --> 00:34:19,777
Let me go.

622
00:34:19,811 --> 00:34:21,378
Let's say you do get out
of here.

623
00:34:21,411 --> 00:34:22,747
Then what?

624
00:34:22,780 --> 00:34:24,448
You'll be a princess with
absolutely zero ability

625
00:34:24,481 --> 00:34:26,149
to reign while your father
is still locked up

626
00:34:26,183 --> 00:34:27,517
in this mill.

627
00:34:27,551 --> 00:34:29,286
What, do you think
Madame Mizrabel, or better yet,

628
00:34:29,319 --> 00:34:30,755
Master Willow's just going
to let him go

629
00:34:30,788 --> 00:34:33,156
because Celestia's itsy-bitsy
know-nothing princess

630
00:34:33,190 --> 00:34:34,726
wants him to?

631
00:34:34,759 --> 00:34:36,460
You say what?

632
00:34:36,493 --> 00:34:38,563
What? What was it, "itsy-bitsy"?

633
00:34:38,596 --> 00:34:39,931
My father.

634
00:34:39,964 --> 00:34:41,599
He's alive?

635
00:34:54,846 --> 00:34:58,583
♪ No amount of time
could be enough ♪

636
00:35:04,488 --> 00:35:09,259
♪ To share with you the love
inside my heart ♪

637
00:35:12,597 --> 00:35:16,768
♪ There is not a single thing
on Earth ♪

638
00:35:19,737 --> 00:35:24,575
♪ That could express
the blessing that you are ♪

639
00:35:27,377 --> 00:35:31,816
♪ Just know that I'm not leaving
you behind ♪

640
00:35:35,252 --> 00:35:40,490
♪ Oh, my love,
this is not goodbye ♪

641
00:35:47,865 --> 00:35:49,934
If I hadn't
been hiding behind that wall,

642
00:35:49,967 --> 00:35:51,401
I could've saved him.

643
00:35:52,570 --> 00:35:54,304
You said that, not me.

644
00:35:56,874 --> 00:35:58,375
Come on, come on!

645
00:35:58,408 --> 00:35:59,911
But yeah, you did kinda lock
yourself in a room...

646
00:35:59,944 --> 00:36:01,511
We're not leaving here
until we find him.

647
00:36:03,815 --> 00:36:07,952
I'm sorry, Geneva, but this
isn't your tale to rewrite.

648
00:36:07,985 --> 00:36:09,453
It's all in the timing,

649
00:36:09,486 --> 00:36:11,254
and the timing on the stage
is controlled by...

650
00:36:12,690 --> 00:36:13,991
Willow.

651
00:36:14,025 --> 00:36:15,425
How did you guess?

652
00:36:16,861 --> 00:36:18,796
I am the Princess of Celestia,

653
00:36:18,830 --> 00:36:21,599
and I'm asking you to help me
find the king.

654
00:36:21,632 --> 00:36:23,300
This is not a request.

655
00:36:24,434 --> 00:36:25,937
I will either find
and free my father,

656
00:36:25,970 --> 00:36:27,672
or I will die seeking him.

657
00:36:38,850 --> 00:36:39,751
Faster!

658
00:36:41,418 --> 00:36:42,419
He means business!

659
00:36:43,654 --> 00:36:44,722
Wowwee!

660
00:36:53,463 --> 00:36:54,599
Wow.

661
00:36:56,701 --> 00:36:57,869
Your Majesty?

662
00:37:01,973 --> 00:37:03,473
Are they alive?

663
00:37:07,879 --> 00:37:09,479
Oh, sorry.

664
00:37:13,383 --> 00:37:14,551
Something isn't right.

665
00:37:14,585 --> 00:37:16,453
But, what is it?

666
00:37:16,486 --> 00:37:19,489
Like your Bavarian cream,
they're cursed.

667
00:37:19,523 --> 00:37:21,692
But, why bananas, huh?

668
00:37:21,726 --> 00:37:23,728
They're to entice the children
into this horrid place.

669
00:37:23,761 --> 00:37:25,096
Oh.

670
00:37:25,129 --> 00:37:28,365
"Hiccups", "sleep",
and "laughter."

671
00:37:28,398 --> 00:37:29,700
But, what's a hoglet?

672
00:37:31,535 --> 00:37:32,637
It's no time to laugh.

673
00:37:33,771 --> 00:37:34,806
I didn't laugh.

674
00:37:35,973 --> 00:37:37,809
Oh, wowwee, wowwee!

675
00:37:40,443 --> 00:37:43,047
Let me go, pig, please!

676
00:37:43,080 --> 00:37:45,650
- You're not going anywhere.
- Get away from her!

677
00:37:45,683 --> 00:37:47,350
- Sit still.
- Put me down!

678
00:37:47,384 --> 00:37:48,920
See that shroud?

679
00:37:48,953 --> 00:37:51,556
He has a little present for you,
little gremlin.

680
00:37:51,589 --> 00:37:53,423
Are you ready for something
special?

681
00:37:57,494 --> 00:37:59,362
Can you two lovely
humans stop stepping on my paws?

682
00:38:07,805 --> 00:38:09,106
That smell.

683
00:38:10,507 --> 00:38:12,009
Well don't look at me
when you say it.

684
00:38:13,578 --> 00:38:14,946
It smells like...

685
00:38:15,313 --> 00:38:16,814
Zungenwurst.

686
00:38:18,049 --> 00:38:19,482
Tongue sausage.

687
00:38:19,516 --> 00:38:21,052
Indeed.

688
00:38:21,085 --> 00:38:22,687
Though at the moment I believe
it to be coming from...

689
00:38:25,756 --> 00:38:28,593
a gargantuan squabby nearby.

690
00:38:28,626 --> 00:38:31,729
- A gargantuan squabby?
- Yes.

691
00:38:31,762 --> 00:38:33,530
They're fierce castle dwellers.

692
00:38:33,564 --> 00:38:35,532
Indigenous to Celestia.

693
00:38:35,566 --> 00:38:39,469
They usually keep to themselves,
unless, that is,

694
00:38:39,502 --> 00:38:41,639
they smell human blood.

695
00:38:43,808 --> 00:38:45,076
No! No-no!

696
00:38:45,977 --> 00:38:47,178
Listen.

697
00:38:47,211 --> 00:38:48,646
Oh, god.

698
00:38:48,679 --> 00:38:49,714
It may have mercy on us here
if it gets caught

699
00:38:49,747 --> 00:38:50,447
in a giant squabby trap.

700
00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:51,983
I vote we leave now!

701
00:38:52,016 --> 00:38:54,185
- Is he scary?
- Very.

702
00:38:54,218 --> 00:38:55,653
Oh,
I've always been a good animal.

703
00:38:55,686 --> 00:38:57,121
I never wanted to hurt anybody!

704
00:38:57,154 --> 00:38:58,689
Is he hungry?

705
00:38:58,723 --> 00:39:01,058
He's malnourished.

706
00:39:01,092 --> 00:39:02,459
Please let me see.

707
00:39:02,492 --> 00:39:04,527
I'm a strong princess.

708
00:39:05,029 --> 00:39:06,864
Let me at that squabby.

709
00:39:06,898 --> 00:39:08,566
- No!
- No, no!

710
00:39:10,935 --> 00:39:12,837
It's so sad.

711
00:39:14,071 --> 00:39:16,841
The poor thing
is trapped in here.

712
00:39:16,874 --> 00:39:18,809
Don't be fooled
by its 11-inch physique.

713
00:39:18,843 --> 00:39:20,510
Are you serious?

714
00:39:20,543 --> 00:39:24,682
How can anything be a threat
that would fit in this box?

715
00:39:24,715 --> 00:39:25,950
Wait!

716
00:39:25,983 --> 00:39:28,551
You are not going to squash
the squabby.

717
00:39:28,586 --> 00:39:30,021
Please let him squash it.

718
00:39:30,054 --> 00:39:31,088
Please.

719
00:39:32,790 --> 00:39:34,025
Oh, we tried to warn you.

720
00:39:36,093 --> 00:39:36,694
Princess...

721
00:39:39,597 --> 00:39:41,098
You-you...

722
00:39:41,132 --> 00:39:42,499
No-no!

723
00:39:42,532 --> 00:39:43,134
Don't squish me!

724
00:39:43,167 --> 00:39:44,802
You grubby little...

725
00:39:46,671 --> 00:39:48,639
That's using the ol' noggin'.

726
00:39:48,673 --> 00:39:49,707
It hurt.

727
00:39:50,708 --> 00:39:52,843
Oh. Well let's use these.

728
00:39:52,877 --> 00:39:54,779
Go ahead, Punch 'N Judy.

729
00:39:54,812 --> 00:39:56,747
But they're skeletons.

730
00:39:56,781 --> 00:39:58,548
With how this is going,

731
00:39:58,582 --> 00:40:00,151
I don't bethink we'll maketh 't
five feet from our chamber!

732
00:40:00,184 --> 00:40:01,652
You clod.

733
00:40:01,686 --> 00:40:04,088
Do you wanna go back
to wrangling Alpacas?

734
00:40:04,121 --> 00:40:05,890
- No.
- With the squeals?

735
00:40:05,923 --> 00:40:06,991
No, stop it.

736
00:40:07,024 --> 00:40:10,161
- I can hear them.
- Stop. No-no, stop.

737
00:40:11,128 --> 00:40:12,263
No! You're tormenting me.

738
00:40:12,296 --> 00:40:13,064
Stop it,
you're being a bully!

739
00:40:15,866 --> 00:40:17,802
You are an evil, evil woman.

740
00:40:19,103 --> 00:40:20,938
See? Was that so bad?

741
00:40:22,039 --> 00:40:23,174
No, not at all.

742
00:40:28,112 --> 00:40:29,847
Madame Mizrabel.

743
00:40:32,249 --> 00:40:34,685
The king attempted to escape.

744
00:40:34,719 --> 00:40:35,886
But don't worry.

745
00:40:35,920 --> 00:40:38,521
We got him, and his little pet.

746
00:40:38,556 --> 00:40:40,558
Look how blue she is.

747
00:40:43,260 --> 00:40:46,731
You got into my potions,

748
00:40:46,764 --> 00:40:48,599
sweet little tot?

749
00:40:49,266 --> 00:40:52,703
Looks as if you found the Garden
of Children, as well.

750
00:40:55,840 --> 00:40:58,175
No! No!

751
00:41:03,748 --> 00:41:04,882
Don't hurt him.

752
00:41:07,118 --> 00:41:09,253
Please spare my life.

753
00:41:15,626 --> 00:41:18,262
- Chain her and leave!
- No.

754
00:41:19,797 --> 00:41:22,166

I don't know.

878
00:48:49,246 --> 00:48:50,715
I never came here before.

879
00:48:50,748 --> 00:48:52,516
But if I were to guess,

880
00:48:52,549 --> 00:48:54,652
I would say it's nothing good.

881
00:48:54,686 --> 00:48:55,587

884
00:49:00,457 --> 00:49:03,126
Princess, are you sure you want
to put your arm in there?

885
00:49:03,160 --> 00:49:04,629
I'm just trying to be cautious.

886
00:49:04,662 --> 00:49:06,798
I am Princess Geneva.

887
00:49:06,831 --> 00:49:09,734
Can you step into the light,
little voice I hear?

888
00:49:13,571 --> 00:49:15,172
It's just a little girl.

889
00:49:18,776 --> 00:49:20,477
Gimme a hand, and a paw.

890
00:49:20,511 --> 00:49:21,178
Princess.

891
00:49:21,211 --> 00:49:22,614
We can't just leave them here.

892
00:49:22,647 --> 00:49:24,248
Hate to be a pessimist,

893
00:49:24,281 --> 00:49:25,683
but I knew as soon as I saw you
yanking on these bars,

894
00:49:25,717 --> 00:49:28,285
something horrible
is going to happen.

895
00:49:29,386 --> 00:49:31,154

896
00:49:32,422 --> 00:49:33,423

897
00:49:33,457 --> 00:49:34,324
Oh, no!

898
00:49:36,493 --> 00:49:38,395
Use your weight and smash it
against the wall!

899
00:49:38,428 --> 00:49:41,164
I am not your mother!

900
00:49:41,198 --> 00:49:43,534
Use your weight and smash it
against the wall!

901
00:49:43,568 --> 00:49:45,369
I have a wonderful idea.

902
00:49:45,402 --> 00:49:47,672
- Yeah? What's that?
- You help me!

903
00:49:50,240 --> 00:49:51,441
You want me to punch it?

904
00:49:53,711 --> 00:49:56,681
I never punched anything
in my life!

905
00:49:56,714 --> 00:49:58,650
- Prince, let me handle this.
- I'm so sorry!

906
00:49:58,683 --> 00:50:01,318
No, don't stop running,
Thumpkin!

907
00:50:01,351 --> 00:50:02,352
Don't you stop!

908
00:50:04,556 --> 00:50:05,690
Don't stop!

909
00:50:05,723 --> 00:50:06,490
I'm trying to unravel
this situation!

910
00:50:14,666 --> 00:50:15,667
Wow.

911
00:50:17,401 --> 00:50:18,703
You my mommy?

912
00:50:20,370 --> 00:50:21,739
Are you Princess Geneva?

913
00:50:22,740 --> 00:50:25,242
I am.

914
00:50:25,275 --> 00:50:26,844
She lives down there.

915
00:50:31,448 --> 00:50:33,651
Spit it out,
you bumbling baboon!

916
00:50:33,685 --> 00:50:34,719
See the keys?

917
00:50:34,752 --> 00:50:36,219
Nothing to see here.

918
00:50:36,253 --> 00:50:38,488
It's just 15-foot monsters
with 100-foot tentacles.

919
00:50:38,522 --> 00:50:41,158
They have to be hiding around
here someplace!

920
00:50:41,191 --> 00:50:42,660
I don't think she's very happy
that we're missing.

921
00:50:42,694 --> 00:50:45,362
We have to find the keys!

922
00:50:45,395 --> 00:50:46,764
Okay, slowly open the door.

923
00:50:46,798 --> 00:50:48,298
Remember, non-conspicuous.

924
00:50:49,701 --> 00:50:52,502
Yeah,
it wasn't entirely our fault.

925
00:50:52,536 --> 00:50:55,807
- Yes, we-well...
- Cover your mouth.

926
00:50:55,840 --> 00:50:57,407
One at a time!

927
00:50:57,441 --> 00:50:59,343
- I can't concentrate.
- It must be the bananas.

928
00:50:59,376 --> 00:51:02,714
What my slimy simpleton
of a partner is trying to say is

929
00:51:02,747 --> 00:51:05,617
we weren't completely
in control of the...

930
00:51:05,650 --> 00:51:07,417
- Can you do it, Thump?
- Mhm.

931
00:51:07,451 --> 00:51:09,152
Yeah,
exactly what pig brains over here said.

932
00:51:09,186 --> 00:51:10,622
Who are you calling pig brain?

933
00:51:12,222 --> 00:51:13,658
He's the smallest.

934
00:51:13,691 --> 00:51:16,193
I don't want anything to happen
to you, old chum.

935
00:51:16,226 --> 00:51:17,361
We have his back.

936
00:51:18,596 --> 00:51:19,897
Let me be useful, Corny.

937
00:51:19,931 --> 00:51:21,431
You gotta believe me.

938
00:51:21,465 --> 00:51:22,734
I can do it!

939
00:51:22,767 --> 00:51:25,302
I've been praying my whole life
for this moment.

940
00:51:25,335 --> 00:51:27,572
My chance in the spotlight.

941
00:51:27,605 --> 00:51:30,875
The whole world will say,
"Thumpkin, you did it.

942
00:51:30,908 --> 00:51:32,542
You saved the day!"

943
00:51:32,577 --> 00:51:34,544
You're chewing the scenery
a little bit, aren't you?

944
00:51:35,813 --> 00:51:36,614
Don't.

945
00:51:38,382 --> 00:51:39,817
We'll give them a taste
of their own medicine.

946
00:51:41,318 --> 00:51:43,153
We'll ghost it up.

947
00:51:44,388 --> 00:51:45,690
I need my motivation.

948
00:51:45,723 --> 00:51:47,625
What's my motivation, Corny?

949
00:51:47,659 --> 00:51:48,325
Yeah-yeah-yeah.

950
00:51:48,358 --> 00:51:49,192
Action!

951
00:51:49,226 --> 00:51:52,529
You were the Madame's
butler, Otto.

952
00:51:52,563 --> 00:51:54,431
After returning home
one stormy evening

953
00:51:54,464 --> 00:51:57,234
where she was unsatisfied
with your schnitzel...

954
00:51:57,267 --> 00:51:59,871
- My schnitzel?
- Your schnitzel.

955
00:51:59,904 --> 00:52:01,739
She decided to do you in.

956
00:52:04,842 --> 00:52:08,579
Now, you have returned to get
revenge for your murder,

957
00:52:08,613 --> 00:52:10,848
and her critique of your
unsatisfactory

958
00:52:10,882 --> 00:52:13,350
cylindrical minced
and seasoned skin!

959
00:52:17,387 --> 00:52:20,357
Boo.

960
00:52:20,992 --> 00:52:22,627
That ain't gonna work.

961
00:52:22,660 --> 00:52:23,193
Give him a break.

962
00:52:23,226 --> 00:52:24,929
It was his first try.

963
00:52:24,962 --> 00:52:25,830
Oh, it's dark in here.

964
00:52:25,863 --> 00:52:27,264
I'm allergic to darkness!

965
00:52:27,297 --> 00:52:28,365
Try again.

966
00:52:28,398 --> 00:52:31,435
Boo.

967
00:52:33,370 --> 00:52:34,072
Whatever,
we're running out of time.

968
00:52:34,105 --> 00:52:34,906
- Go.
- All right, I got this.

969
00:52:34,939 --> 00:52:36,607
What do you mean
you can't find her?

970
00:52:36,641 --> 00:52:38,009
They were all gone...

971
00:52:38,042 --> 00:52:40,243
How did she escape the chamber
in the first place?

972
00:52:40,277 --> 00:52:42,345
Okay, here we go.

973
00:52:42,379 --> 00:52:44,347
Like I said before,
Madame, it wasn't entirely our fault.

974
00:52:44,381 --> 00:52:46,383
Here we go.

975
00:52:46,416 --> 00:52:47,852
Oh.

976
00:52:49,921 --> 00:52:51,622
- Look guys, I got 'em!
- Get over here!

977
00:52:51,656 --> 00:52:53,390
Dear wife,
I don't remember you saying,

978
00:52:53,423 --> 00:52:57,028
"I take this owl to be your
lawfully-wedded husband!"

979
00:52:57,061 --> 00:53:00,430
Hunt down that girl
and bring her to me.

980
00:53:00,464 --> 00:53:02,633
I'm going to feast upon her
heart in front of all of you!

981
00:53:02,667 --> 00:53:04,468
Oh, schnitzel.

982
00:53:05,335 --> 00:53:06,470
Uh-oh.

983
00:53:09,306 --> 00:53:10,875
Who goes there?

984
00:53:10,908 --> 00:53:12,777
Um...

985
00:53:18,015 --> 00:53:20,350
My name is Otto!

986
00:53:20,383 --> 00:53:23,755
I come back to suck your blood!

987
00:53:23,788 --> 00:53:27,692
I come back to suck your blood!

988
00:53:28,492 --> 00:53:29,392
No bad words.

989
00:53:30,460 --> 00:53:31,328
Boo.

990
00:53:33,831 --> 00:53:35,032
All right,
come on, kids, come on.

991
00:53:35,066 --> 00:53:38,401
- Single file. Let's go. Come on.
- Follow me. Come on, girls!

992
00:53:38,435 --> 00:53:39,771
Geneva, Cornelis and Thumpkin

993
00:53:39,804 --> 00:53:41,639
ran straight to the captured
children,

994
00:53:41,672 --> 00:53:43,040
unlocked those doors,

995
00:53:43,074 --> 00:53:44,842
and vanished deep into the pit
of the mill.

996
00:53:44,876 --> 00:53:47,377
Master Willow won't take this
lightly, you know.

997
00:53:48,846 --> 00:53:51,916
The old witch didn't
howl, roar, or shriek,

998
00:53:51,949 --> 00:53:54,551
as she knew the princess would
not be leaving

999
00:53:54,585 --> 00:53:56,921
without finding
her beloved father, the king.

1000
00:53:56,954 --> 00:53:58,089
Princess,
she will eventually come find us.

1001
00:53:58,122 --> 00:53:59,690
That's how fairy tales work!

1002
00:54:02,660 --> 00:54:03,961
Oh, God.

1003
00:54:05,930 --> 00:54:08,398
Well, hello, little one.

1004
00:54:08,431 --> 00:54:09,934
Princess, we have to move!

1005
00:54:11,035 --> 00:54:12,402
You know how to get home?

1006
00:54:14,038 --> 00:54:15,072
Geneva.

1007
00:54:18,075 --> 00:54:20,711
You go straight home
to your parents.

1008
00:54:39,897 --> 00:54:42,332
Know that there's a strong girl
inside.

1009
00:54:49,539 --> 00:54:51,642
If you find the king,
please tell him,

1010
00:54:51,676 --> 00:54:53,443
Chickpea says thanks.

1011
00:54:59,083 --> 00:55:00,918
Go home, all of you.

1012
00:55:00,952 --> 00:55:01,953
Go home, all of you.

1013
00:55:01,986 --> 00:55:02,987
Come on, girls, this way!

1014
00:55:04,555 --> 00:55:05,857
Follow me, you guys.

1015
00:55:05,890 --> 00:55:06,924
I know how to get home.

1016
00:55:18,002 --> 00:55:19,103
No more hiccups.

1017
00:55:20,437 --> 00:55:21,606
- Dance.
- Dance?

1018
00:55:21,639 --> 00:55:22,773
- It'll distract 'em.
- How?

1019
00:55:22,807 --> 00:55:24,374
Trust me.

1020
00:55:32,216 --> 00:55:33,818
Yeah,
show 'em what you got, Corny.

1021
00:55:47,231 --> 00:55:48,232
This is my sword!

1022
00:55:48,266 --> 00:55:50,868
There are many like it,
but this one is mine!

1023
00:55:50,902 --> 00:55:54,105
Where's my father,
you... you...

1024
00:55:54,138 --> 00:55:55,472
you... you witch?

1025
00:55:56,741 --> 00:55:58,541
Come on, come on!

1026
00:55:58,576 --> 00:55:59,710
I swear by this sword!

1027
00:55:59,744 --> 00:56:01,444
You make one more move
and it will be...

1028
00:56:01,478 --> 00:56:05,182
It may be big and all that,
but he knows how to use it.

1029
00:56:07,184 --> 00:56:08,819
- Thank you, Princess.
- You got it.

1030
00:56:12,590 --> 00:56:13,658
Thump!

1031
00:56:15,559 --> 00:56:17,494
Come on, buddy, wake up.

1032
00:56:31,208 --> 00:56:34,078
- Daddy!
- Silence.

1033
00:56:34,412 --> 00:56:36,914
- Princess.
- Daddy.

1034
00:56:38,149 --> 00:56:39,482
Come forward.

1035
00:56:43,921 --> 00:56:45,957
You betrayed my trust.

1036
00:56:45,990 --> 00:56:48,192
The princess, she escaped.

1037
00:56:48,225 --> 00:56:51,963
- And I just...
- I gave an order.

1038
00:56:51,996 --> 00:56:55,566
Yes, Master. You did.

1039
00:56:55,599 --> 00:56:59,270
At your own accord,
you've chosen fear over courage.

1040
00:56:59,303 --> 00:57:01,672
Please, Lord,
I was just trying to...

1041
00:57:01,706 --> 00:57:06,143
The princess,
on the other hand, has shown much valor.

1042
00:57:06,177 --> 00:57:08,045
Princess?

1043
00:57:11,248 --> 00:57:14,752
I am going to grant you
a bargain,

1044
00:57:14,785 --> 00:57:18,956
a moment to preserve yourself
and your father.

1045
00:57:20,291 --> 00:57:21,926
- I'll do anything.
- Geneva.

1046
00:57:24,261 --> 00:57:26,230
Sing for me.

1047
00:57:31,268 --> 00:57:33,004
I, I...

1048
00:57:35,239 --> 00:57:36,273
Princess.

1049
00:57:36,307 --> 00:57:38,743
Sing!

1050
00:57:41,879 --> 00:57:44,982
Would you be so kind as to allow
me to hold my father?

1051
00:58:13,878 --> 00:58:18,682
Master, may I please have
a moment with my daughter?

1052
00:58:19,984 --> 00:58:21,118
Please?

1053
00:58:28,359 --> 00:58:31,195
What am I supposed to do, Daddy?

1054
00:58:31,228 --> 00:58:34,732
How can I make you proud?

1055
00:58:34,765 --> 00:58:37,001
If you're always in fear,

1056
00:58:37,034 --> 00:58:39,203
you'll never know what awaits
for you in your imagination.

1057
00:58:41,405 --> 00:58:44,842
You have to be strong,
a strong princess.

1058
00:58:48,712 --> 00:58:53,184
It's okay, it's okay,
it's okay to cry.

1059
00:58:53,217 --> 00:58:58,255
Now, it's time for you to sing,
and go home.

1060
00:59:00,391 --> 00:59:03,360
You may always return
when you're ready.

1061
00:59:03,394 --> 00:59:05,663
When you need to.

1062
00:59:05,696 --> 00:59:07,131

I'm an endangered species!

1111
01:04:29,553 --> 01:04:31,989
We almost lost you.

1112
01:04:32,022 --> 01:04:34,525
It won't be the same
without thou.

1113
01:04:35,693 --> 01:04:37,961
I'll be back again one day.

1114
01:04:39,163 --> 01:04:41,331
On thine own time.

1115
01:04:51,408 --> 01:04:53,410
You're not a dog.

1116
01:04:53,444 --> 01:04:55,546
You're not a cat.

1117
01:04:55,580 --> 01:04:57,981
You're not a fox or a rat.

1118
01:04:59,416 --> 01:05:01,285
You're you.

1119
01:05:13,096 --> 01:05:15,567
Farewell,
it's been fun, Princess.

1120
01:05:19,169 --> 01:05:22,539
The wall is broken.

1121
01:05:22,574 --> 01:05:25,275
Just don't forget about me.

1122
01:05:26,043 --> 01:05:27,779
Never again.

1123
01:05:34,518 --> 01:05:36,186
Sorry, I just...

1124
01:05:36,220 --> 01:05:38,388
this kind of flew off
when you...

1125
01:05:38,422 --> 01:05:39,456
Well...

1126
01:06:01,345 --> 01:06:03,648
So, how do I get back again?

1127
01:06:03,681 --> 01:06:04,548
Oh.

1128
01:06:08,552 --> 01:06:10,254
You gotta be kidding me.

1129
01:06:10,287 --> 01:06:13,190
Just try not to hit your head
too hard this time, Princess.

1130
01:06:13,223 --> 01:06:16,460
- Corny.
- We haven't found another way.

1131
01:06:16,493 --> 01:06:18,228
This is ridiculous.

1132
01:06:19,564 --> 01:06:21,164
Even if I wanted to slip,
which I...

1133
01:06:21,733 --> 01:06:22,767

Wake up, will ya?

1138
01:06:43,353 --> 01:06:44,354
Come on.

1139
01:06:44,388 --> 01:06:45,790

1140
01:06:48,258 --> 01:06:50,662
You okay? Come on, wake up.

1141
01:06:50,695 --> 01:06:51,696
That's right.

1142
01:06:52,564 --> 01:06:54,231
Oh, thank god.

1143
01:06:56,568 --> 01:06:59,236
They just think it's exhaustion.

1144
01:06:59,269 --> 01:07:01,438
Sorry I yelled at you, Brax.

1145
01:07:01,471 --> 01:07:04,809
I'm gonna be home every day
by 5:00.

1146
01:07:04,842 --> 01:07:08,211
Weekends are off-limits.

1147
01:07:08,245 --> 01:07:09,513
We're just gonna have to
compromise.

1148
01:07:11,148 --> 01:07:12,684
We are gonna make it work.

1149
01:07:14,551 --> 01:07:15,787
The three of us.

1150
01:07:24,227 --> 01:07:25,830
Can I just check one thing?

1151
01:07:53,658 --> 01:07:55,525
The four of us.

1152
01:08:09,239 --> 01:08:11,375
And,
although the precious family was longing

1153
01:08:11,408 --> 01:08:13,443
for their beloved father,

1154
01:08:13,477 --> 01:08:18,448
his spirit forever found ways to
nurture his loves from afar.

1155
01:08:19,884 --> 01:08:21,351
The end.

1156
01:12:00,705 --> 01:12:03,473
I did a whole song
and dance and everything.

1157
01:12:03,506 --> 01:12:05,408
She just doesn't get
the timing thing.
