1
00:03:31,733 --> 00:03:34,823
Miguel, come here.

2
00:03:34,910 --> 00:03:37,695
- Hi, Calista.
- Hi.

3
00:03:37,782 --> 00:03:39,610
Um, what is it?

4
00:03:39,697 --> 00:03:41,264
I don't know.

5
00:03:41,351 --> 00:03:43,614
I don't know.

6
00:03:43,701 --> 00:03:45,616
Please, Calista, let me see.

7
00:03:45,703 --> 00:03:48,750
Um... no.

8
00:03:48,837 --> 00:03:51,535
Please, let me see.

9
00:03:51,622 --> 00:03:54,321
No.

10
00:03:54,408 --> 00:03:56,497
Okay, for your birthday.

11
00:04:01,328 --> 00:04:04,287
Wow. Thanks.

12
00:04:04,374 --> 00:04:06,115
You can't open it today.

13
00:04:06,202 --> 00:04:07,769
Tomorrow.

14
00:04:08,987 --> 00:04:11,816
Okay, tomorrow.

15
00:04:15,342 --> 00:04:17,996
- Bye.
- Bye.

16
00:04:37,799 --> 00:04:39,888
Oscar.

17
00:04:39,975 --> 00:04:41,672
Take your share.

18
00:04:41,759 --> 00:04:43,021
That's too much.

19
00:04:43,108 --> 00:04:45,285
That's more than fair,
my friend.

20
00:04:45,372 --> 00:04:46,764
Papai!

21
00:04:46,851 --> 00:04:47,896
Son!

22
00:04:47,983 --> 00:04:50,942
Miguel!

23
00:04:51,029 --> 00:04:52,117
Calista's not with you?

24
00:04:52,204 --> 00:04:54,685
Um, no, she's in the village.

25
00:04:54,772 --> 00:04:56,339
Oh, okay.

26
00:04:56,426 --> 00:04:58,559
Are you coming to my house
tomorrow?

27
00:04:58,646 --> 00:04:59,690
Of course I am.

28
00:04:59,777 --> 00:05:00,996
It's your birthday.

29
00:05:01,083 --> 00:05:03,172
Here you go.

30
00:05:03,259 --> 00:05:04,565
Thank you.

31
00:05:04,652 --> 00:05:06,610
- See you tomorrow.
- See you tomorrow.

32
00:05:06,697 --> 00:05:09,961
Luis, Marcos.

33
00:05:10,048 --> 00:05:11,311
How was school?

34
00:05:11,398 --> 00:05:12,790
Good.

35
00:05:15,358 --> 00:05:17,142
Can I fish with you tomorrow?

36
00:05:17,229 --> 00:05:19,188
You have school, Miguel.

37
00:05:19,275 --> 00:05:20,231
Please.

38
00:05:20,232 --> 00:05:22,018
We'll see.

39
00:05:22,104 --> 00:05:24,149
That's a good one.

40
00:05:34,290 --> 00:05:35,509
Race you!

41
00:05:41,819 --> 00:05:43,604
Hi, Mamae!

42
00:05:44,692 --> 00:05:45,606
How was school today?

43
00:05:45,607 --> 00:05:47,085
Good.

44
00:05:47,172 --> 00:05:49,000
Are these for the market?

45
00:05:49,087 --> 00:05:50,611
Yes, love, don't touch it.

46
00:05:50,698 --> 00:05:52,917
Why do they always
have to be for the market?

47
00:05:53,004 --> 00:05:56,138
But I'm making you something
special for tomorrow.

48
00:05:56,225 --> 00:05:59,054
Please, Mama, can I have
one guava sweet?

49
00:05:59,141 --> 00:06:01,143
After dinner.

50
00:06:14,330 --> 00:06:16,680
Someone's excited
for your birthday?

51
00:06:18,203 --> 00:06:19,814
Just Calista.

52
00:06:22,556 --> 00:06:25,123
Miguel, don't forget
your homework.

53
00:07:15,347 --> 00:07:18,220
Papai?

54
00:07:18,307 --> 00:07:21,441
Please let me go with
you tomorrow.

55
00:07:21,528 --> 00:07:23,094
We'll see in the morning.

56
00:07:23,181 --> 00:07:26,054
But you have to finish your
homework first.

57
00:07:29,449 --> 00:07:31,799
Papai, I have to
tell you something.

58
00:07:31,886 --> 00:07:33,104
What's that?

59
00:07:33,191 --> 00:07:35,193
You smell...

60
00:07:37,152 --> 00:07:39,807
...like stinky fish.

61
00:07:41,025 --> 00:07:42,679
You do.

62
00:07:42,766 --> 00:07:46,248
Well, I'm going to get
both of you stinky!

63
00:07:47,902 --> 00:07:49,512
Joao, no!

64
00:07:58,216 --> 00:07:59,348
Time for bed.

65
00:07:59,435 --> 00:08:01,698
Oh, not yet, Mamae.

66
00:08:01,785 --> 00:08:04,092
Good night, son.

67
00:08:15,190 --> 00:08:16,800
Good morning.

68
00:08:16,887 --> 00:08:18,802
Good morning.

69
00:08:20,021 --> 00:08:21,021
Papai?

70
00:08:21,022 --> 00:08:22,720
Happy birthday.

71
00:08:22,806 --> 00:08:24,765
Thanks.

72
00:08:24,852 --> 00:08:27,202
Can we go now?

73
00:08:28,856 --> 00:08:30,118
I'm not sure.

74
00:08:30,205 --> 00:08:32,033
The clouds are changing.

75
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:33,730
Please, Papai.

76
00:08:38,082 --> 00:08:41,390
You are a persistent one,
my son.

77
00:08:47,831 --> 00:08:50,007
- Push.
- Okay.

78
00:09:00,322 --> 00:09:01,671
Hold on.

79
00:09:16,773 --> 00:09:18,558
- We are going back.
- Papai, no!

80
00:09:18,645 --> 00:09:20,385
- We are going back.
- You promised!

81
00:09:20,472 --> 00:09:21,691
Miguel.

82
00:09:26,261 --> 00:09:27,479
Hold on!

83
00:09:29,394 --> 00:09:30,570
Papai!

84
00:09:37,707 --> 00:09:39,013
Papai!

85
00:09:43,583 --> 00:09:44,975
Papai!

86
00:09:52,243 --> 00:09:53,810
Miguel!

87
00:10:04,429 --> 00:10:07,476
Miguel! Miguel.

88
00:12:45,286 --> 00:12:47,070
Oh, look at them.

89
00:12:47,157 --> 00:12:49,290
The migration
has begun, Stephanie.

90
00:12:56,297 --> 00:12:57,472
Look! There they go!

91
00:15:39,199 --> 00:15:41,941
That's okay.

92
00:15:45,248 --> 00:15:47,207
It's all right.

93
00:15:51,602 --> 00:15:52,734
Joao?

94
00:15:56,738 --> 00:15:59,132
- Why bother?
- He'll come around one day.

95
00:15:59,219 --> 00:16:01,177
I don't think so.

96
00:16:01,264 --> 00:16:02,570
We're still his friends.

97
00:16:02,657 --> 00:16:04,137
So you tell him that.

98
00:16:04,224 --> 00:16:06,487
If he talked to us,
we would.

99
00:16:06,574 --> 00:16:09,664
That old man is broken and
nothing's fixing him.

100
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:22,938
Oscar.

101
00:17:35,184 --> 00:17:37,621
Wait, I know.

102
00:17:37,708 --> 00:17:40,276
Stay, stay here.

103
00:17:48,110 --> 00:17:50,721
Okay, what do I have?

104
00:17:50,808 --> 00:17:52,158
Ah.

105
00:18:02,124 --> 00:18:03,256
Don't move.

106
00:18:04,866 --> 00:18:07,347
Here. Here.

107
00:18:14,441 --> 00:18:15,877
One more.

108
00:18:17,922 --> 00:18:19,576
Your last one.

109
00:18:32,241 --> 00:18:34,896
Wait, wait, wait.

110
00:18:34,983 --> 00:18:36,071
Don't move.

111
00:18:39,683 --> 00:18:41,859
I will get you clean.

112
00:18:43,078 --> 00:18:45,689
Ah. Yeah.

113
00:18:54,176 --> 00:18:55,917
Yes, yes.

114
00:19:08,843 --> 00:19:11,062
Look at this oil on you.

115
00:19:14,065 --> 00:19:15,284
Yes.

116
00:19:16,981 --> 00:19:18,548
No.

117
00:19:18,635 --> 00:19:20,681
Yeah, yeah.

118
00:19:22,248 --> 00:19:24,119
No, yes.

119
00:19:25,642 --> 00:19:28,036
You're doing well.

120
00:19:41,745 --> 00:19:43,138
Thank you, Calista.

121
00:19:43,225 --> 00:19:44,705
You're welcome.

122
00:19:45,793 --> 00:19:47,055
Here we go.

123
00:19:47,142 --> 00:19:48,230
Mamai!

124
00:19:48,317 --> 00:19:50,406
Hey, baby.

125
00:19:50,493 --> 00:19:51,494
All done with school.

126
00:19:51,581 --> 00:19:53,888
Yes.

127
00:19:53,975 --> 00:19:56,195
We miss your guava sweets.

128
00:19:56,282 --> 00:19:59,763
Mamae said
you make the best ones.

129
00:19:59,850 --> 00:20:00,982
Thank you.

130
00:20:01,069 --> 00:20:02,462
- Bye.
- Bye.

131
00:20:19,218 --> 00:20:21,220
- Hello.
- How was it?

132
00:20:21,307 --> 00:20:24,223
Oh, it was too hot.

133
00:20:25,006 --> 00:20:26,225
Hmm.

134
00:20:56,255 --> 00:20:58,257
Wait. Wait.

135
00:20:58,344 --> 00:20:59,693
What is that?

136
00:20:59,780 --> 00:21:00,998
Joao?

137
00:21:01,085 --> 00:21:02,085
Wait.

138
00:21:02,086 --> 00:21:04,263
What's in there?

139
00:21:12,314 --> 00:21:14,751
Why is a penguin in our home?

140
00:21:14,838 --> 00:21:16,623
It needs our help.

141
00:21:16,710 --> 00:21:18,886
- What?
- Yes.

142
00:21:18,973 --> 00:21:21,410
He was covered in oil
and barely alive.

143
00:21:21,497 --> 00:21:24,500
Uh-huh. That's why the oil
is all over my kitchen.

144
00:21:24,587 --> 00:21:25,719
Yes.

145
00:21:25,806 --> 00:21:27,721
That penguin cannot stay.

146
00:21:29,288 --> 00:21:31,246
I can't even use my bathroom.

147
00:21:44,215 --> 00:21:45,260
It's going to be fine.

148
00:21:45,347 --> 00:21:47,610
I fix him up, he leaves.

149
00:21:47,697 --> 00:21:49,133
Mm-mm.

150
00:21:49,220 --> 00:21:51,571
He needs
a few days, to rest.

151
00:21:59,143 --> 00:22:01,624
Wait! Wait!

152
00:22:06,977 --> 00:22:08,805
A few days.

153
00:22:26,997 --> 00:22:29,435
Keep still.

154
00:22:34,135 --> 00:22:35,919
Wait, there is oil everywhere.

155
00:22:36,006 --> 00:22:38,400
Yes. Everywhere.

156
00:22:38,487 --> 00:22:40,184
Yeah.

157
00:22:42,186 --> 00:22:45,625
Don't move, no, don't move.

158
00:22:45,712 --> 00:22:47,322
Don't do that.

159
00:22:48,628 --> 00:22:50,717
My goodness.

160
00:22:50,804 --> 00:22:51,716
I have this for you.

161
00:22:51,718 --> 00:22:52,718
No, no, no, no, no.

162
00:22:52,762 --> 00:22:54,198
- Watch it.
- Here you go.

163
00:22:54,285 --> 00:22:56,113
No, this one is dirty.

164
00:22:56,200 --> 00:22:59,203
Wait, come, come,
come with me. Come.

165
00:22:59,290 --> 00:23:00,553
Yeah.

166
00:23:02,206 --> 00:23:04,774
Hold him, please,
hold him.

167
00:23:06,167 --> 00:23:08,735
I'm coming.

168
00:23:08,822 --> 00:23:10,127
What are you doing?

169
00:23:10,214 --> 00:23:12,434
Joao.

170
00:23:13,783 --> 00:23:15,350
Hurry up, Joao, hurry up.

171
00:23:32,323 --> 00:23:33,323
What are you doing?

172
00:23:33,324 --> 00:23:36,024
- Here.
- Joao.

173
00:23:37,807 --> 00:23:40,114
It's okay, it's all right.

174
00:23:59,960 --> 00:24:01,396
Yeah.

175
00:25:03,327 --> 00:25:05,286
For the penguin... again?

176
00:25:05,373 --> 00:25:07,593
Yes.

177
00:25:07,680 --> 00:25:10,117
He needs to get stronger.

178
00:25:10,204 --> 00:25:11,901
How can I make breakfast?

179
00:25:13,163 --> 00:25:15,775
It's been a week, Joao.

180
00:25:15,862 --> 00:25:17,820
One more week.

181
00:25:56,946 --> 00:25:59,688
Come on, don't be scared.

182
00:26:02,604 --> 00:26:04,824
You know,

183
00:26:04,911 --> 00:26:07,174
when you get
your good feathers,

184
00:26:07,261 --> 00:26:11,004
you can go, okay?

185
00:26:24,234 --> 00:26:25,627
Hey.

186
00:26:31,241 --> 00:26:33,200
Look what I have for you.

187
00:26:37,334 --> 00:26:39,162
Come.

188
00:26:39,249 --> 00:26:42,992
Yes. Yes.

189
00:26:43,079 --> 00:26:44,080
Good.

190
00:26:44,167 --> 00:26:46,169
Come, come.

191
00:26:46,256 --> 00:26:47,562
Come up here.

192
00:26:47,649 --> 00:26:50,609
Yeah, let's have a look.

193
00:26:52,872 --> 00:26:55,222
Don't move, no, stay here.

194
00:26:56,484 --> 00:26:57,746
Stay here.

195
00:26:59,139 --> 00:27:02,055
Ah, good.

196
00:27:03,273 --> 00:27:05,014
Very good.

197
00:27:13,414 --> 00:27:14,981
Take it easy.

198
00:27:17,287 --> 00:27:18,462
What?

199
00:27:29,212 --> 00:27:30,953
Lucia, come back.

200
00:27:33,086 --> 00:27:34,609
It's a penguin!

201
00:27:37,220 --> 00:27:39,832
Can I talk to him?

202
00:27:39,919 --> 00:27:41,616
He's shy.

203
00:27:42,791 --> 00:27:43,879
Ola, penguin!

204
00:27:45,751 --> 00:27:46,926
What is it?

205
00:27:47,013 --> 00:27:48,231
It's a penguin!

206
00:27:48,318 --> 00:27:50,538
Lucia, it's time to head home.

207
00:27:50,625 --> 00:27:53,410
Look, Mamae! It's true!

208
00:27:55,761 --> 00:27:57,110
Oh?

209
00:27:57,197 --> 00:27:59,112
Ola, Calista.

210
00:27:59,199 --> 00:28:00,287
Ola.

211
00:28:04,813 --> 00:28:06,597
I've never seen
a penguin before.

212
00:28:06,685 --> 00:28:07,990
What's his name?

213
00:28:08,077 --> 00:28:11,254
He doesn't have one.

214
00:28:11,341 --> 00:28:13,822
I think...

215
00:28:13,909 --> 00:28:15,955
his name...

216
00:28:16,042 --> 00:28:19,741
should be DinDim! Yes! DinDim.

217
00:28:19,828 --> 00:28:21,482
DinDim?

218
00:28:21,569 --> 00:28:22,875
Okay.

219
00:28:22,962 --> 00:28:24,572
DinDim.

220
00:28:24,659 --> 00:28:26,095
DinDim?

221
00:28:29,359 --> 00:28:31,666
Nice to meet you, DinDim.

222
00:28:33,189 --> 00:28:34,800
Where are you taking him?

223
00:28:34,887 --> 00:28:36,584
Back out there.

224
00:28:37,759 --> 00:28:40,283
Do you have to?

225
00:28:40,370 --> 00:28:42,242
He needs to go home.

226
00:28:43,939 --> 00:28:47,203
Will you see him again?

227
00:28:47,290 --> 00:28:48,639
No.

228
00:28:50,467 --> 00:28:52,165
Well, let's say
good-bye, then.

229
00:28:54,689 --> 00:28:57,605
Okay. Bye, DinDim.

230
00:28:57,692 --> 00:28:59,694
Come, baby.

231
00:28:59,781 --> 00:29:01,130
Bye, Calista.

232
00:29:11,140 --> 00:29:13,055
I'm sad for Joao.

233
00:29:23,065 --> 00:29:25,067
DinDim.

234
00:29:25,154 --> 00:29:27,243
How about that?

235
00:29:58,187 --> 00:29:59,536
Here.

236
00:30:04,672 --> 00:30:06,021
Stay here.

237
00:30:16,075 --> 00:30:18,468
No. No.

238
00:30:18,555 --> 00:30:21,080
You can't come with me.

239
00:30:21,167 --> 00:30:22,690
You need to go home.

240
00:30:25,258 --> 00:30:27,782
Go away.

241
00:30:27,869 --> 00:30:29,523
Don't come with me.

242
00:30:41,796 --> 00:30:44,581
You are a persistent one.

243
00:30:44,668 --> 00:30:46,235
Really.

244
00:31:33,630 --> 00:31:35,415
Are you okay?

245
00:31:35,502 --> 00:31:37,243
Yeah.

246
00:31:37,330 --> 00:31:39,767
You did what was best
for the penguin.

247
00:31:39,854 --> 00:31:40,722
For DinDim.

248
00:31:40,724 --> 00:31:42,074
For what?

249
00:31:42,161 --> 00:31:45,338
Lucia gave him a name.

250
00:31:45,425 --> 00:31:47,209
DinDim.

251
00:31:47,296 --> 00:31:49,777
You spoke to Lucia?

252
00:31:49,864 --> 00:31:52,867
Yes, DinDim.

253
00:31:52,954 --> 00:31:54,086
I like it.

254
00:32:51,317 --> 00:32:52,971
Where are you going?

255
00:32:54,146 --> 00:32:56,017
Ah.

256
00:33:12,033 --> 00:33:14,166
DinDim?

257
00:33:14,253 --> 00:33:15,384
Is that you?

258
00:33:20,302 --> 00:33:21,869
What happened?

259
00:33:21,956 --> 00:33:24,480
I don't know,
he came home.

260
00:33:24,567 --> 00:33:26,482
Oh. Home?

261
00:33:26,569 --> 00:33:30,051
Yes, he thinks it is.

262
00:33:30,138 --> 00:33:31,966
Yes.

263
00:33:33,272 --> 00:33:34,490
How far did you take him?

264
00:33:34,577 --> 00:33:39,930
To the cave,
on the outer island.

265
00:33:43,195 --> 00:33:45,675
And he came back?

266
00:33:45,762 --> 00:33:47,329
DinDim came back.

267
00:33:56,469 --> 00:33:58,732
Yes, here.

268
00:34:00,560 --> 00:34:02,823
You're really hungry.

269
00:34:16,489 --> 00:34:18,708
What is that?

270
00:34:18,795 --> 00:34:21,320
Where did it come from?

271
00:34:21,407 --> 00:34:23,061
Joao, who is this?

272
00:34:23,148 --> 00:34:25,454
This is DinDim!

273
00:34:25,541 --> 00:34:26,541
What?

274
00:34:26,542 --> 00:34:27,804
DinDim.

275
00:34:27,891 --> 00:34:29,893
My granddaughter just
named him that.

276
00:34:29,980 --> 00:34:33,941
Yes.
I need some fish.

277
00:34:34,028 --> 00:34:36,335
It's for him.

278
00:34:36,422 --> 00:34:38,859
Small ones, please.

279
00:34:40,295 --> 00:34:42,297
Hold on there, DinDim!

280
00:34:42,384 --> 00:34:44,343
They are too big for you.

281
00:34:44,430 --> 00:34:46,171
Here.

282
00:34:47,433 --> 00:34:50,305
Hey, good boy, Din Dim.

283
00:34:53,482 --> 00:34:54,918
Look at this.

284
00:34:57,965 --> 00:34:59,793
Pretty bad.

285
00:34:59,880 --> 00:35:01,186
Take this other one.

286
00:35:01,273 --> 00:35:03,101
Where did you get him?

287
00:35:03,188 --> 00:35:06,800
On the beach,
about a month ago.

288
00:35:06,887 --> 00:35:08,932
Soaked in oil.

289
00:35:09,019 --> 00:35:10,847
He's lucky he found you.

290
00:35:10,934 --> 00:35:13,067
I am lucky.

291
00:35:13,154 --> 00:35:14,808
Ask him if he's going
to keep him.

292
00:35:14,895 --> 00:35:16,592
Maybe you should ask.

293
00:35:16,679 --> 00:35:19,334
He does what
he wants, you know?

294
00:35:19,421 --> 00:35:20,770
He is free.

295
00:35:20,857 --> 00:35:22,598
You know, guys,
I was remembering

296
00:35:22,685 --> 00:35:24,296
that time, we were kids,

297
00:35:24,383 --> 00:35:26,950
and we saw a shark.

298
00:35:27,037 --> 00:35:29,736
Something very big...
remember that?

299
00:35:29,823 --> 00:35:31,651
I remember.

300
00:35:31,738 --> 00:35:34,436
We came back so fast.

301
00:35:34,523 --> 00:35:36,656
No one believed us.

302
00:35:36,743 --> 00:35:38,832
You were there too, Joao.

303
00:35:38,919 --> 00:35:39,919
Oscar, too!

304
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:42,966
I don't remember.

305
00:35:43,053 --> 00:35:45,708
No. No.

306
00:35:47,275 --> 00:35:48,929
Thanks for the fish.

307
00:35:49,016 --> 00:35:50,148
DinDim?

308
00:36:46,073 --> 00:36:47,770
Joao.

309
00:36:49,032 --> 00:36:50,599
What did you do?

310
00:36:51,861 --> 00:36:52,906
It is for the penguin.

311
00:36:52,993 --> 00:36:55,517
Everything is for the penguin.

312
00:39:21,750 --> 00:39:22,969
Hey!

313
00:39:57,133 --> 00:40:00,876
Dindim! Dindim!

314
00:40:06,926 --> 00:40:08,710
DinDim!

315
00:42:30,417 --> 00:42:31,897
Breakfast!

316
00:42:33,115 --> 00:42:34,203
DinDim?

317
00:43:37,702 --> 00:43:40,095
Here, here.

318
00:43:42,315 --> 00:43:44,012
This way, little guy.

319
00:43:45,318 --> 00:43:46,798
This one's taking
his sweet time.

320
00:43:50,976 --> 00:43:52,281
Careful.

321
00:43:53,674 --> 00:43:55,807
He went right in.

322
00:43:56,982 --> 00:43:58,331
Perfect.

323
00:43:58,418 --> 00:43:59,854
I got it.

324
00:44:04,598 --> 00:44:06,382
- Well done.
- Thank you.

325
00:44:27,360 --> 00:44:28,883
Take him out.
Let's weigh him.

326
00:44:28,970 --> 00:44:30,189
Yes.

327
00:44:31,407 --> 00:44:32,931
Come, little guy.

328
00:44:36,717 --> 00:44:38,719
Okay.

329
00:44:42,549 --> 00:44:45,639
- Five kilos.
- Impressive.

330
00:44:47,075 --> 00:44:48,773
Okay, okay. Shh, shh, shh.

331
00:44:48,860 --> 00:44:50,905
Steady, there.

332
00:44:52,167 --> 00:44:54,692
Okay, we're almost done.

333
00:44:57,346 --> 00:45:00,306
Sixty-four centimeters long.

334
00:45:04,049 --> 00:45:06,138
Twenty centimeters wide.

335
00:45:06,225 --> 00:45:07,356
Got it.

336
00:45:10,664 --> 00:45:11,665
He's so friendly.

337
00:45:11,752 --> 00:45:13,580
Do they normally do that?

338
00:45:13,667 --> 00:45:15,669
No.

339
00:45:15,756 --> 00:45:19,325
No, it's not normal,
it's abnormal.

340
00:45:19,412 --> 00:45:20,412
Hand me a tag, please.

341
00:45:20,456 --> 00:45:21,719
Steph?

342
00:45:23,851 --> 00:45:25,766
Come on, little guy.

343
00:45:27,246 --> 00:45:28,900
Hold him tight.

344
00:45:28,987 --> 00:45:31,250
Okay.

345
00:45:34,340 --> 00:45:36,646
He's very calm.

346
00:45:36,734 --> 00:45:37,952
Shh, shh, shh.

347
00:45:41,042 --> 00:45:44,089
There, now we are friends.

348
00:45:44,176 --> 00:45:45,220
Fish bribe.

349
00:45:45,307 --> 00:45:47,005
Works every time.

350
00:45:47,092 --> 00:45:49,485
Okay.

351
00:45:54,882 --> 00:45:56,405
There you go.

352
00:46:02,020 --> 00:46:03,630
Is he okay?

353
00:46:03,717 --> 00:46:05,980
He will try to shake it off.

354
00:46:06,067 --> 00:46:07,677
He'll be fine.

355
00:46:07,765 --> 00:46:09,941
Stephanie,
let's go match his nest.

356
00:46:10,028 --> 00:46:12,508
- Can you grab the nest tag?
- Yeah.

357
00:46:34,269 --> 00:46:36,184
What's this all over his nest?

358
00:46:36,271 --> 00:46:37,664
Is it trash?

359
00:46:37,751 --> 00:46:39,927
Interesting.

360
00:46:40,014 --> 00:46:41,711
It's a look.

361
00:46:43,148 --> 00:46:45,411
It's quite different.

362
00:46:47,282 --> 00:46:48,718
It's highly abnormal.

363
00:46:48,806 --> 00:46:51,591
Abnormal is so negative.

364
00:46:53,723 --> 00:46:57,118
Should we help him
clear out some of the trash?

365
00:46:57,205 --> 00:46:58,380
He looks well.

366
00:46:58,467 --> 00:47:01,035
He doesn't
seem to be eating it.

367
00:47:01,122 --> 00:47:02,645
Let not interfere.

368
00:47:06,780 --> 00:47:08,216
He's smart.

369
00:48:51,754 --> 00:48:55,976
Joao, don't do it.

370
00:48:56,063 --> 00:48:57,369
Here.

371
00:49:26,224 --> 00:49:28,922
They always find their
way back, don't they?

372
00:49:29,009 --> 00:49:31,185
Same nest, same mate.

373
00:49:31,272 --> 00:49:33,100
The mystery of penguin GPS.

374
00:49:33,187 --> 00:49:34,884
It could be smell.

375
00:49:34,972 --> 00:49:37,017
Or a special protein
in their eyes?

376
00:49:37,104 --> 00:49:38,801
A photoreceptor?

377
00:49:38,888 --> 00:49:41,152
That's quite a penguin
super power if that's proven.

378
00:49:41,239 --> 00:49:43,458
Penguins obviously have
super powers.

379
00:49:43,545 --> 00:49:44,982
They are flightless birds,

380
00:49:45,069 --> 00:49:47,375
up against terrible
environmental stressors.

381
00:49:47,462 --> 00:49:49,334
Oh, you're such a pessimist.

382
00:49:49,421 --> 00:49:51,771
Realist.

383
00:49:51,858 --> 00:49:54,774
There must be something else.

384
00:49:54,861 --> 00:49:58,430
Actually, my theory is...

385
00:50:00,432 --> 00:50:04,914
they learn to adapt.

386
00:50:05,002 --> 00:50:07,352
So adaptation is their
superpower?

387
00:50:07,439 --> 00:50:08,788
Do I have it right?

388
00:50:08,875 --> 00:50:10,572
No, they don't have
superpowers.

389
00:50:10,659 --> 00:50:12,096
Carlos, relax.

390
00:50:12,183 --> 00:50:14,446
I'm just saying, it's a
teaching moment.

391
00:50:14,533 --> 00:50:15,533
She's kidding.

392
00:50:24,586 --> 00:50:26,588
Is this for me?

393
00:50:26,675 --> 00:50:28,155
Thank you.

394
00:50:31,463 --> 00:50:33,291
Carlos, do we have
the camera with us?

395
00:50:33,378 --> 00:50:34,727
Yeah.

396
00:50:40,776 --> 00:50:41,864
You have...

397
00:50:43,910 --> 00:50:45,955
Hey.

398
00:50:47,957 --> 00:50:50,134
You are very odd,
little bird.

399
00:50:52,484 --> 00:50:54,007
I like you.

400
00:50:58,533 --> 00:50:59,795
Let's go.

401
00:51:52,109 --> 00:51:53,240
DinDim?

402
00:52:13,478 --> 00:52:15,741
Maria!

403
00:52:15,828 --> 00:52:17,569
Maria, look at that.

404
00:52:17,656 --> 00:52:21,181
He's back?

405
00:52:21,268 --> 00:52:22,835
After all this time?

406
00:52:25,098 --> 00:52:27,056
What is that thing?

407
00:52:27,144 --> 00:52:28,144
What?

408
00:52:28,145 --> 00:52:30,147
The red thing.

409
00:52:30,234 --> 00:52:32,410
I don't know.

410
00:52:33,628 --> 00:52:35,761
Are you hungry? Eh?

411
00:52:35,848 --> 00:52:36,849
Of course.

412
00:52:47,686 --> 00:52:48,991
This one is beautiful.

413
00:52:51,211 --> 00:52:52,386
Thank you, sweetie.

414
00:52:52,473 --> 00:52:54,171
You're so nice.

415
00:52:55,911 --> 00:52:57,348
What?

416
00:52:58,610 --> 00:52:59,654
DinDim's back!

417
00:53:02,266 --> 00:53:04,093
Joao is in the village.

418
00:53:07,488 --> 00:53:08,489
It's a penguin.

419
00:53:08,576 --> 00:53:10,143
Ola.

420
00:53:13,886 --> 00:53:16,062
Hello, Joao.

421
00:53:16,149 --> 00:53:17,455
I can't believe it.

422
00:53:17,542 --> 00:53:19,587
It's a penguin!

423
00:53:27,769 --> 00:53:29,815
Look at them.

424
00:53:32,948 --> 00:53:36,038
DinDim!

425
00:53:36,125 --> 00:53:37,431
Good to see you, Joao.

426
00:53:37,518 --> 00:53:39,216
Ola.

427
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:42,828
Oh, wow.

428
00:53:42,915 --> 00:53:45,961
I've never seen
something so cute.

429
00:53:46,048 --> 00:53:47,485
He so cute.

430
00:53:51,619 --> 00:53:53,621
He's so special.

431
00:53:59,148 --> 00:54:00,585
Is he your pet?

432
00:54:01,760 --> 00:54:03,109
Not my pet.

433
00:54:03,196 --> 00:54:04,719
He's my friend.

434
00:54:04,806 --> 00:54:06,112
He chooses to be with Joao.

435
00:54:06,199 --> 00:54:08,636
With us, he chooses
to be with us.

436
00:54:12,336 --> 00:54:14,163
It's okay, DinDim.

437
00:54:15,948 --> 00:54:17,558
What did you call him?

438
00:54:17,645 --> 00:54:20,039
DinDim.

439
00:54:20,126 --> 00:54:21,693
This is DinDim.

440
00:54:21,780 --> 00:54:24,565
Hi.

441
00:54:24,652 --> 00:54:26,611
Hi, DinDim.

442
00:54:43,105 --> 00:54:45,282
Hi, listen to this story.

443
00:54:45,369 --> 00:54:48,633
This is DinDim,
a little penguin

444
00:54:48,720 --> 00:54:52,114
who comes to our
village every year.

445
00:54:54,769 --> 00:54:56,597
Adriana, Adriana.

446
00:54:56,684 --> 00:54:58,077
You have to see this.

447
00:54:58,164 --> 00:55:00,427
I sent you the link.

448
00:55:00,514 --> 00:55:02,168
Excuse me.
You won't believe it.

449
00:55:02,255 --> 00:55:04,039
Okay, I was doing something.

450
00:55:04,126 --> 00:55:05,345
Hi...

451
00:55:05,432 --> 00:55:07,304
Look!
Four million views.

452
00:55:07,391 --> 00:55:08,391
What?

453
00:55:08,392 --> 00:55:10,002
He's famous.

454
00:55:10,089 --> 00:55:11,308
Who's famous?

455
00:55:11,395 --> 00:55:14,049
Look.
The penguin.

456
00:55:14,136 --> 00:55:17,052
...this same house

457
00:55:17,139 --> 00:55:21,796
to visit his friend, Joao,
a fisherman who saved him.

458
00:55:21,883 --> 00:55:24,756
Hmm, I don't know,
that's... that's not right.

459
00:55:27,324 --> 00:55:29,108
It's kind of sweet.

460
00:55:29,195 --> 00:55:31,066
Even you have to
admit that, Carlos.

461
00:55:31,153 --> 00:55:33,765
That guy is way off course.

462
00:55:35,767 --> 00:55:37,812
Look at this.

463
00:55:37,899 --> 00:55:39,423
I bet it's one of ours.

464
00:55:39,510 --> 00:55:41,120
I am not a betting man,
but if I was,

465
00:55:41,207 --> 00:55:43,818
I would not
bet on that, really.

466
00:55:43,905 --> 00:55:45,211
It could be from anywhere.

467
00:55:45,298 --> 00:55:46,517
It's true.

468
00:55:46,604 --> 00:55:49,824
He's awfully far
to be one of ours.

469
00:55:49,911 --> 00:55:51,783
We have to check.

470
00:55:51,870 --> 00:55:53,785
Do you they say
where he's from in Brazil?

471
00:55:53,872 --> 00:55:57,005
Um...

472
00:55:57,092 --> 00:55:58,572
It's a tropical place.

473
00:55:58,659 --> 00:56:01,923
Yeah, a place called Ilha
Grande near Rio de Janeiro.

474
00:56:06,101 --> 00:56:08,756
This is very interesting.

475
00:56:10,018 --> 00:56:13,326
What is he doing so far away
and so far north?

476
00:56:13,413 --> 00:56:14,632
Lost?

477
00:56:14,719 --> 00:56:16,155
He's lost looking for food?

478
00:56:16,242 --> 00:56:18,287
Chased by predators?

479
00:56:18,375 --> 00:56:20,507
He's quite comfortable
with humans.

480
00:56:25,686 --> 00:56:26,731
Look at this.

481
00:56:26,818 --> 00:56:28,559
He's so cute!

482
00:56:28,646 --> 00:56:29,821
Hello, Paulo.

483
00:56:29,908 --> 00:56:31,692
How is Rio?

484
00:56:31,779 --> 00:56:34,042
Listen, I need a favor.

485
00:56:34,129 --> 00:56:35,329
There's a video I just watched

486
00:56:35,392 --> 00:56:38,699
of a Magellanic
penguin in Ilha...

487
00:56:38,786 --> 00:56:41,441
Yes!

488
00:56:41,528 --> 00:56:43,922
Yes, that's the one.

489
00:56:44,009 --> 00:56:45,619
Can you go there?

490
00:56:48,056 --> 00:56:49,928
I need you to get
the tag number.

491
00:56:51,277 --> 00:56:52,974
It's a long shot,
but I would like to know

492
00:56:53,061 --> 00:56:55,803
if he's one of ours.

493
00:56:55,890 --> 00:56:58,066
Oh, that's wonderful.

494
00:56:58,153 --> 00:57:01,418
Thank you so much,
Paulo.

495
00:57:03,768 --> 00:57:05,030
What was that?

496
00:57:05,117 --> 00:57:07,467
It's how we are going to
figure this out.

497
00:57:07,554 --> 00:57:10,209
Great!
How much should we bet?

498
00:57:10,296 --> 00:57:12,864
How much?

499
00:57:12,951 --> 00:57:15,562
Well done.

500
00:57:15,649 --> 00:57:18,696
Okay, it's fascinating,
but we have to work.

501
00:57:18,783 --> 00:57:20,393
- Okay.
- Go, go, go.

502
00:57:22,917 --> 00:57:23,917
Okay.

503
00:58:09,877 --> 00:58:12,097
Hello? Is anyone home?

504
00:58:12,184 --> 00:58:14,360
Yes?

505
00:58:14,447 --> 00:58:17,102
Ooh, ooh.

506
00:58:17,189 --> 00:58:20,975
Hi, um, sorry to bother you,
I'm Paulo,

507
00:58:21,062 --> 00:58:24,762
and I would like to talk
to you about the penguin.

508
00:58:26,024 --> 00:58:27,024
What about him?

509
00:58:30,942 --> 00:58:32,334
Thank you for the water.

510
00:58:32,421 --> 00:58:35,599
What can we do for you, Paulo?

511
00:58:35,686 --> 00:58:37,514
Well, there's something.

512
00:58:37,601 --> 00:58:39,951
I was contacted
by my friend Adriana.

513
00:58:40,038 --> 00:58:43,389
She's a Marine Biologist
in Argentina.

514
00:58:43,476 --> 00:58:44,825
And she saw the video.

515
00:58:44,912 --> 00:58:46,348
What video?

516
00:58:46,435 --> 00:58:49,917
The video of you and the
penguin... I mean DinDim.

517
00:58:50,004 --> 00:58:52,311
It went viral.

518
00:58:52,398 --> 00:58:54,095
So?

519
00:58:54,182 --> 00:58:57,229
Well, a lot of people around
the world have seen it.

520
00:58:59,057 --> 00:59:01,625
Mmm. Delicious.

521
00:59:04,584 --> 00:59:06,194
Why are you here?

522
00:59:06,281 --> 00:59:10,068
Well, Adriana asked me
to check

523
00:59:10,155 --> 00:59:12,287
the penguin's tag number.

524
00:59:12,374 --> 00:59:15,160
Why?
Are you going to take him?

525
00:59:15,247 --> 00:59:17,031
No, no, no, no.

526
00:59:17,118 --> 00:59:20,992
I'm not here to cause any
trouble, I promise.

527
00:59:21,079 --> 00:59:23,647
Joao, it's okay.

528
00:59:32,264 --> 00:59:34,614
K-2-6.

529
00:59:34,701 --> 00:59:38,836
- K-2-6.
- 1-0-9.

530
00:59:38,923 --> 00:59:41,099
- One?
- Zero, nine.

531
00:59:41,186 --> 00:59:42,970
Zero, nine.

532
00:59:47,758 --> 00:59:49,542
Thank you.

533
00:59:51,718 --> 00:59:53,459
Listen.

534
00:59:53,546 --> 00:59:54,939
I would love to do

535
00:59:55,026 --> 00:59:58,638
a television interview
with you.

536
00:59:58,725 --> 01:00:01,685
No.

537
01:00:01,772 --> 01:00:03,077
No interview.

538
01:00:05,340 --> 01:00:07,038
Be polite, hmm?

539
01:00:08,430 --> 01:00:09,823
I'm a freelance journalist,

540
01:00:09,910 --> 01:00:11,738
and I've worked
for many publications.

541
01:00:11,825 --> 01:00:13,740
We are ordinary people.

542
01:00:13,827 --> 01:00:15,786
Yes, I understand.

543
01:00:15,873 --> 01:00:17,875
It's just a penguin.

544
01:00:17,962 --> 01:00:20,442
Yeah, but I want
to reassure you...

545
01:00:20,529 --> 01:00:24,229
We've lived a quiet life.

546
01:00:24,316 --> 01:00:26,927
That's what Joao means.

547
01:00:27,014 --> 01:00:29,495
I think the whole world
will be interested

548
01:00:29,582 --> 01:00:31,105
in the story of
you and DinDim.

549
01:00:31,192 --> 01:00:33,107
No.

550
01:00:35,457 --> 01:00:37,155
Okay, thank you.

551
01:00:37,242 --> 01:00:40,332
It was a pleasure to meet
DinDim, and you both,

552
01:00:40,419 --> 01:00:41,855
- of course.
- Thank you.

553
01:00:51,865 --> 01:00:54,694
Um, Joao.

554
01:00:54,781 --> 01:01:00,134
This... whatever this is...

555
01:01:00,221 --> 01:01:02,876
You and DinDim have
quite a friendship.

556
01:01:04,443 --> 01:01:06,793
And it gives me hope,
you know.

557
01:01:06,880 --> 01:01:11,189
That's all,
it's made my day and...

558
01:01:11,276 --> 01:01:13,321
thank you.

559
01:01:13,408 --> 01:01:15,410
I needed it.

560
01:01:21,373 --> 01:01:24,158
He's a persistent man.

561
01:01:28,859 --> 01:01:30,251
Paulo!

562
01:01:31,949 --> 01:01:34,168
Yes?

563
01:01:34,255 --> 01:01:37,084
One thing you need to know
for the interview.

564
01:01:38,695 --> 01:01:43,134
DinDim comes and goes
as he pleases.

565
01:01:43,221 --> 01:01:44,526
As he pleases.

566
01:01:49,009 --> 01:01:50,358
Thank you.

567
01:02:15,862 --> 01:02:16,863
Okay, good.

568
01:02:16,950 --> 01:02:18,299
Yes, got it.

569
01:02:18,386 --> 01:02:20,301
Thank you, Paulo.
I owe you one.

570
01:02:21,694 --> 01:02:22,889
Stephanie,
can you pull up the file?

571
01:02:22,913 --> 01:02:24,523
- Yes.
- Okay, here it is.

572
01:02:27,700 --> 01:02:28,875
K...

573
01:02:28,962 --> 01:02:33,227
K-26-1-0-9.

574
01:02:35,447 --> 01:02:39,146
Here.

575
01:02:39,233 --> 01:02:41,148
That's incredible.

576
01:02:41,235 --> 01:02:42,497
It's one of ours.

577
01:02:42,584 --> 01:02:45,457
And you have a note here.

578
01:02:45,544 --> 01:02:48,155
Look.

579
01:02:48,242 --> 01:02:49,548
Are you kidding?

580
01:02:49,635 --> 01:02:50,635
What is it?

581
01:02:50,636 --> 01:02:51,680
It's the one.

582
01:02:51,768 --> 01:02:52,856
The abnormal one?

583
01:02:52,943 --> 01:02:56,076
Unique. Unique.

584
01:02:56,163 --> 01:02:57,295
I knew we should've bet.

585
01:03:05,738 --> 01:03:07,871
Hey.

586
01:03:07,958 --> 01:03:10,699
Hello, DinDim.

587
01:03:20,535 --> 01:03:21,667
Hello?

588
01:03:29,153 --> 01:03:31,503
Ola.

589
01:03:31,590 --> 01:03:33,548
Hi, Maria.

590
01:03:33,635 --> 01:03:36,116
- Hi. Hi.
- How are you?

591
01:03:36,203 --> 01:03:38,162
Mm, something smells good.

592
01:03:38,249 --> 01:03:39,641
Thank you.

593
01:03:39,728 --> 01:03:41,687
I made a big pot
of stew for everybody.

594
01:03:41,774 --> 01:03:43,602
Hopefully I've made enough.

595
01:03:43,689 --> 01:03:47,040
Welcome. Welcome.

596
01:03:47,127 --> 01:03:49,390
Hi, Joao,
nice seeing you again.

597
01:03:49,477 --> 01:03:50,522
- Ola.
- Ola.

598
01:03:50,609 --> 01:03:52,393
This is my crew.

599
01:03:59,836 --> 01:04:01,272
Okay?

600
01:04:12,718 --> 01:04:15,503
Hi, Joao! Hi, DinDim!

601
01:04:15,590 --> 01:04:17,592
Joao, please, over here.

602
01:04:17,679 --> 01:04:19,246
Tell us about DinDim.

603
01:04:19,333 --> 01:04:21,553
Yes.

604
01:04:21,640 --> 01:04:25,426
The last couple of years,
he showed up in June,

605
01:04:25,513 --> 01:04:28,908
and he went away in December.

606
01:04:28,995 --> 01:04:32,651
He comes and goes
as he pleases.

607
01:04:32,738 --> 01:04:35,088
Do you think
he'll keep coming back?

608
01:04:35,175 --> 01:04:38,222
Yes. I think so.

609
01:04:38,309 --> 01:04:40,615
He's always
so happy to see Joao.

610
01:04:42,008 --> 01:04:44,358
The little penguin
travels 5,000 miles

611
01:04:44,445 --> 01:04:47,057
every year between
Patagonia and Ilha Grande

612
01:04:47,144 --> 01:04:49,494
to visit his friend Joao.

613
01:04:56,631 --> 01:04:58,155
Yeah.

614
01:05:00,548 --> 01:05:01,636
One minute.

615
01:05:01,723 --> 01:05:03,073
It's the boss.

616
01:05:05,379 --> 01:05:06,598
Yes, Kim, how are you?

617
01:05:06,685 --> 01:05:08,295
I'm good.

618
01:05:08,382 --> 01:05:09,969
I hope things
are going well in the field.

619
01:05:09,993 --> 01:05:11,211
Can I share some news?

620
01:05:11,298 --> 01:05:13,170
Sure, what's going on?

621
01:05:13,257 --> 01:05:16,782
You know the penguin that
you told me about? DinDim?

622
01:05:16,869 --> 01:05:19,306
Our team wants him to live
here at the University,

623
01:05:19,393 --> 01:05:20,873
in the observation lab.

624
01:05:22,135 --> 01:05:24,094
No, not DinDim.

625
01:05:24,181 --> 01:05:25,443
Why?

626
01:05:25,530 --> 01:05:27,880
I don't think
he would do well.

627
01:05:29,273 --> 01:05:31,884
We would like to study
his human interactions.

628
01:05:31,971 --> 01:05:35,235
He actually seems
to look for it.

629
01:05:35,322 --> 01:05:38,021
Well, yes.

630
01:05:38,108 --> 01:05:41,328
But he does fine
with penguins, too.

631
01:05:41,415 --> 01:05:43,852
But we have ten Magellanic
penguins here now.

632
01:05:43,940 --> 01:05:45,680
He will do great.

633
01:05:45,767 --> 01:05:47,726
The board will make
a decision in a few weeks.

634
01:05:47,813 --> 01:05:50,729
There may be a grant
for you and your team.

635
01:05:50,816 --> 01:05:52,209
I will get back to you.

636
01:05:52,296 --> 01:05:53,427
Okay.

637
01:05:53,514 --> 01:05:54,733
Bye, Adriana.

638
01:07:24,040 --> 01:07:26,868
Hey, we were looking for you.

639
01:07:26,955 --> 01:07:28,609
Is everything okay?

640
01:07:32,178 --> 01:07:34,267
We could use the grant.

641
01:07:35,529 --> 01:07:36,878
Yeah.

642
01:07:38,141 --> 01:07:40,230
We could upgrade
our equipment,

643
01:07:40,317 --> 01:07:41,927
help more penguins.

644
01:07:42,014 --> 01:07:44,103
Really?

645
01:07:44,190 --> 01:07:46,410
I don't know.

646
01:07:50,196 --> 01:07:52,677
The question is,
what's best for DinDim?

647
01:07:56,246 --> 01:07:59,379
That man in Brazil,
he says he comes and goes.

648
01:07:59,466 --> 01:08:02,252
He'll have human
and penguin contact.

649
01:08:04,341 --> 01:08:06,125
He'll be happy.

650
01:08:06,212 --> 01:08:07,300
How do you know that?

651
01:08:09,563 --> 01:08:15,091
He seems perfectly happy now,
and can live in both worlds.

652
01:08:59,091 --> 01:09:02,094
Look... this nest
is far away from the sea.

653
01:09:03,400 --> 01:09:06,490
They are all grown up
and ready to migrate.

654
01:09:13,323 --> 01:09:15,325
Adriana?

655
01:09:15,412 --> 01:09:16,891
Hello, Adriana.

656
01:09:16,978 --> 01:09:18,502
It's been difficult
to reach you.

657
01:09:18,589 --> 01:09:20,547
I know the season is ending,

658
01:09:20,634 --> 01:09:24,029
so I want to let you know we
have decided to take DinDim.

659
01:09:24,116 --> 01:09:25,659
I promise we will keep him
safe and happy.

660
01:09:25,683 --> 01:09:27,598
That's a mistake.

661
01:09:27,685 --> 01:09:30,340
You will need to bring him
in the next couple of days.

662
01:09:30,427 --> 01:09:32,124
I'm sure you understand.

663
01:09:32,211 --> 01:09:34,779
By the way, you got the grant.

664
01:09:34,866 --> 01:09:37,390
Thanks, Adriana.

665
01:10:04,809 --> 01:10:06,767
Hi, DinDim.

666
01:10:17,865 --> 01:10:19,476
Here.

667
01:10:20,738 --> 01:10:23,915
Okay.

668
01:10:24,002 --> 01:10:26,004
I'm sorry.

669
01:10:46,981 --> 01:10:48,766
Coming.

670
01:10:48,853 --> 01:10:50,289
- Joao.
- Paulo.

671
01:10:50,376 --> 01:10:51,769
My friend.

672
01:10:51,856 --> 01:10:53,510
Welcome back.

673
01:10:53,597 --> 01:10:55,338
- Maria, nice to see you.
- Paulo.

674
01:10:55,425 --> 01:10:59,167
I made a special guava
sweet for everybody, okay?

675
01:10:59,255 --> 01:11:00,865
It's beautiful.

676
01:11:00,952 --> 01:11:03,389
Yeah, we hope you aren't
waiting too long for DinDim.

677
01:11:03,476 --> 01:11:04,869
No, it's okay.

678
01:11:04,956 --> 01:11:06,455
We have a nice place
in town, thank you.

679
01:11:06,479 --> 01:11:08,568
He should be here soon.

680
01:11:08,655 --> 01:11:10,962
We are so excited to see
DinDim again.

681
01:11:11,049 --> 01:11:12,659
Thank you for having us.

682
01:11:12,746 --> 01:11:14,052
You are welcome.

683
01:11:14,139 --> 01:11:15,793
Guys, are you okay?
Can we start?

684
01:11:15,880 --> 01:11:16,968
All right.

685
01:11:17,055 --> 01:11:20,058
This way, here.

686
01:11:20,145 --> 01:11:21,277
Look.

687
01:11:23,104 --> 01:11:24,584
I built this for him.

688
01:11:24,671 --> 01:11:25,890
Right.

689
01:11:25,977 --> 01:11:29,763
Yes, he made it his home.

690
01:11:29,850 --> 01:11:33,767
He built it like a burrow,
a penguin's version of a nest.

691
01:11:35,421 --> 01:11:37,293
Excuse me.

692
01:11:43,603 --> 01:11:44,865
Oh, look at that.

693
01:11:44,952 --> 01:11:47,694
He even has a gift for you.

694
01:12:05,103 --> 01:12:07,148
- Do you want to check him?
- He's fine.

695
01:12:24,252 --> 01:12:25,950
I'll take care of
the paperwork.

696
01:12:26,037 --> 01:12:27,168
Okay.

697
01:12:30,737 --> 01:12:32,391
Hello.

698
01:12:36,047 --> 01:12:37,614
Hello, how are you?

699
01:13:07,383 --> 01:13:09,036
Thank you.

700
01:13:26,402 --> 01:13:27,664
- Adriana.
- Yes?

701
01:13:31,145 --> 01:13:32,756
Where is the penguin?

702
01:13:32,843 --> 01:13:34,758
I don't know.

703
01:13:34,845 --> 01:13:36,107
What do you mean
you don't know?

704
01:13:38,283 --> 01:13:40,024
You left the door open.

705
01:13:42,766 --> 01:13:45,638
But he was in a crate,
how did he get out?

706
01:13:45,725 --> 01:13:48,380
You know me,
I don't interfere.

707
01:13:48,467 --> 01:13:50,034
Okay, great.

708
01:13:50,121 --> 01:13:51,252
Just great.

709
01:13:54,778 --> 01:13:56,649
I told you he was different.

710
01:13:56,736 --> 01:13:58,434
Yeah, I can see that.

711
01:13:58,521 --> 01:14:00,174
He's an escape artist.

712
01:14:00,261 --> 01:14:02,046
He knows how to adapt,

713
01:14:02,133 --> 01:14:03,961
which is critical
for his survival.

714
01:14:07,878 --> 01:14:09,270
He'll be fine.

715
01:14:47,787 --> 01:14:50,137
It's good to see you.

716
01:14:50,224 --> 01:14:51,965
Here, help me.

717
01:14:54,272 --> 01:14:56,274
Okay.

718
01:14:58,711 --> 01:15:00,321
Hello, Maria.

719
01:15:06,719 --> 01:15:09,722
- Nice to see you.
- Nice to see you.

720
01:15:15,598 --> 01:15:16,554
Hello.

721
01:15:16,555 --> 01:15:17,731
- Hi.
- Hello.

722
01:15:17,817 --> 01:15:18,838
Hi, what's your name?

723
01:15:18,862 --> 01:15:20,428
Lucia.

724
01:15:20,516 --> 01:15:23,083
Lucia. Lucia,
I heard you named the penguin.

725
01:15:23,170 --> 01:15:24,650
Yes! DinDim!

726
01:15:24,737 --> 01:15:26,826
Is he coming?

727
01:15:26,913 --> 01:15:28,654
Of course he is.

728
01:15:34,312 --> 01:15:36,532
He'll show up.

729
01:15:39,926 --> 01:15:42,146
Darling, let's go.

730
01:15:44,540 --> 01:15:46,411
It's getting late.

731
01:15:48,021 --> 01:15:49,806
Sorry, Joao.

732
01:15:51,677 --> 01:15:55,115
Bye, Maria, see you.

733
01:15:57,727 --> 01:16:00,338
Let's go home, okay?

734
01:17:56,759 --> 01:17:59,762
Well, waiting is half the fun.

735
01:17:59,849 --> 01:18:01,241
For whom?

736
01:18:01,328 --> 01:18:02,852
Tomorrow, Joao.

737
01:18:02,939 --> 01:18:04,767
He's never been this late.

738
01:18:12,688 --> 01:18:15,821
I'm sorry, Maria.

739
01:19:40,036 --> 01:19:41,646
Joao.

740
01:19:43,561 --> 01:19:47,608
Joao. Joao.

741
01:19:53,440 --> 01:19:55,399
You're having dreams.

742
01:19:58,054 --> 01:19:59,882
Do you want some water?

743
01:20:06,758 --> 01:20:08,064
Thank you.

744
01:20:17,943 --> 01:20:20,337
DinDim had this.

745
01:20:20,424 --> 01:20:22,426
I know what it is.

746
01:20:22,513 --> 01:20:24,428
Yes.

747
01:20:24,515 --> 01:20:25,995
What?

748
01:20:26,082 --> 01:20:30,086
It was from Calista,
from a long time ago.

749
01:20:34,568 --> 01:20:36,048
Calista?

750
01:20:38,050 --> 01:20:39,530
Open it.

751
01:22:20,544 --> 01:22:22,285
Hi, Maria.

752
01:22:22,372 --> 01:22:25,114
We've been so worried
these last two weeks.

753
01:22:29,292 --> 01:22:30,946
Hi, Maria.

754
01:22:32,425 --> 01:22:34,036
Hello.

755
01:22:34,123 --> 01:22:37,953
We've been praying for you
and Joao and DinDim.

756
01:22:52,576 --> 01:22:54,795
I have to find him.

01:22:57,233 --> 01:23:01,628
I need to know
I tried everything.

758
01:23:03,413 --> 01:23:05,328
Everything.

759
01:23:18,776 --> 01:23:21,692
I never thought
it was your fault.

760
01:23:25,087 --> 01:23:26,479
Never.

761
01:24:02,950 --> 01:24:04,996
Joao, what are you doing?

762
01:24:05,083 --> 01:24:07,694

I need your help.

765
01:24:14,875 --> 01:24:16,747
DinDim.

766
01:24:18,923 --> 01:24:20,359
Joao needs our help.

767
01:24:20,446 --> 01:24:21,665
Let's get the boats ready!

768
01:24:21,752 --> 01:24:24,059
Okay, then, let's go.

769
01:24:24,146 --> 01:24:26,235
Row, row, guys!

Let's go.

01:24:35,766 --> 01:24:36,984
Come on!

773
01:24:37,072 --> 01:24:38,638
Let's go.

774
01:24:40,423 --> 01:24:41,815
Towards the left!

775
01:24:43,165 --> 01:24:45,254
DinDim!

Come.

780
01:25:00,791 --> 01:25:03,576
DinDim!

781
01:25:03,663 --> 01:25:05,274
It's hard to see.

782
01:25:07,624 --> 01:25:09,930
DinDim!

783
01:25:10,017 --> 01:25:12,194
DinDim!

784
01:25:12,281 --> 01:25:14,370
He's not here.

785
01:25:17,155 --> 01:25:18,852
Do you see him?

786
01:25:18,939 --> 01:25:21,028
Nothing here, Joao!

787
01:25:22,204 --> 01:25:25,903
DinDim! DinDim!

788
01:25:29,385 --> 01:25:30,560
There!

789
01:25:35,826 --> 01:25:37,480
It's just seaweed.

790
01:25:39,177 --> 01:25:40,831
Let's speed up!

791
01:25:40,918 --> 01:25:42,963
Let's try further west!

792
01:25:43,050 --> 01:25:45,792
DinDim!

793
01:25:54,758 --> 01:25:57,108
He didn't make it.

794
01:26:01,025 --> 01:26:02,635
DinDim!

795
01:26:05,334 --> 01:26:07,858
Time to head back!

796
01:26:07,945 --> 01:26:09,816
Let's go home.

797
01:26:09,903 --> 01:26:12,471
It's time to go home!

798
01:26:13,820 --> 01:26:16,475
- Let's turn around.
- Time to go.

799
01:26:21,219 --> 01:26:22,786
I'm sorry, Joao.

800
01:26:24,744 --> 01:26:26,616
It's okay.

801
01:26:26,703 --> 01:26:28,748
Let's try behind the island.

802
01:26:54,905 --> 01:26:56,472
Let's get closer.

803
01:27:24,935 --> 01:27:27,111
There! Over there!

804
01:27:27,198 --> 01:27:29,548
Look!
Do you see him?

805
01:27:29,635 --> 01:27:31,202
There!

806
01:27:33,030 --> 01:27:34,161
Wait, Joao...

Take him.

01:28:05,802 --> 01:28:07,412
Come on, Joao.

809
01:28:14,201 --> 01:28:16,900
Give him, give him to me.

810
01:28:24,821 --> 01:28:28,041
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

811
01:28:29,391 --> 01:28:32,829
Forgive me,
forgive me.

812
01:28:41,272 --> 01:28:43,318
No.

813
01:28:48,975 --> 01:28:50,847
No.

814
01:28:55,591 --> 01:28:57,462
Please.

815
01:29:09,518 --> 01:29:11,171
Here, try some fish.

816
01:29:16,568 --> 01:29:18,448
- Give him some more.
- Give him some more bait.

817
01:29:19,702 --> 01:29:21,530
Take it.

More, more.

819
01:29:49,079 --> 01:29:52,909
He's back, he's back.

820
01:30:25,158 --> 01:30:28,074
Good to see you,

821
01:30:28,161 --> 01:30:29,989
Welcome, Luis!

822
01:30:31,121 --> 01:30:34,211
