1
00:00:29,738 --> 00:00:31,448
I'm really worried about him.

2
00:00:31,531 --> 00:00:34,367
Me too.
I've never seen him this upset.

3
00:00:34,451 --> 00:00:36,251
- I know.
- He's taking it hard.

4
00:00:38,288 --> 00:00:40,415
You know what he said to me?

5
00:00:40,498 --> 00:00:43,334
He said he'll never write
another story ever again.

6
00:00:43,418 --> 00:00:45,003
- He said that?
- Yeah.

7
00:00:47,756 --> 00:00:50,717
This is lame! Stupid!

8
00:00:59,392 --> 00:01:01,394
I'm gonna burn all this stupid stuff!

9
00:01:10,695 --> 00:01:13,948
I'm so afraid that tonight
is gonna, like, stifle him

10
00:01:14,032 --> 00:01:15,950
or be this wound that haunts him.

11
00:01:16,659 --> 00:01:17,659
Poor little guy.

12
00:01:17,702 --> 00:01:19,037
He's a creative kid,

13
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:21,748
but maybe we let his obsession
with horror get out of hand.

14
00:01:22,749 --> 00:01:26,086
I guess I can see
how they could consider it a little weird.

15
00:01:26,169 --> 00:01:30,298
Maybe it would be easier
if he was just more, I don't know, normal.

16
00:01:34,844 --> 00:01:36,471
I think I heard something.

17
00:01:39,432 --> 00:01:40,433
Alex?

18
00:01:40,517 --> 00:01:41,893
I didn't hear anything.

19
00:02:20,390 --> 00:02:21,390
Ugh.

20
00:02:22,058 --> 00:02:24,394
It was all gonna be so perfect, Lucy...

21
00:02:28,189 --> 00:02:30,900
...just like one big, happy family.

22
00:02:33,611 --> 00:02:34,654
Your boys

23
00:02:36,447 --> 00:02:37,574
and my boys.

24
00:02:37,657 --> 00:02:40,451
Great. The bloodsucking Brady Bunch.

25
00:02:40,535 --> 00:02:41,911
Lost Boys?

26
00:02:41,995 --> 00:02:43,413
I still want you, Lucy.

27
00:02:45,456 --> 00:02:47,750
I haven't changed my mind about that.

28
00:02:48,501 --> 00:02:50,712
I didn't invite you this time, Max.

29
00:02:50,795 --> 00:02:51,795
Michael.

30
00:02:54,507 --> 00:02:55,717
Michael, no!

31
00:02:59,846 --> 00:03:00,847
Michael!

32
00:03:10,023 --> 00:03:13,568
- Don't you touch my mother!
- Sam, don't! No, Sam!

33
00:03:51,898 --> 00:03:52,941
Where am I?

34
00:04:00,531 --> 00:04:02,033
Hello?

35
00:04:13,586 --> 00:04:14,504
Hello?

36
00:04:14,587 --> 00:04:15,713
Anyone?

37
00:04:15,797 --> 00:04:17,006
I'm trapped!

38
00:04:17,507 --> 00:04:18,507
Mom!

39
00:04:18,967 --> 00:04:20,009
Dad!

40
00:04:38,611 --> 00:04:40,947
Hello? Help!

41
00:04:41,906 --> 00:04:44,993
What is your name?

42
00:04:45,868 --> 00:04:46,995
A... Alex.

43
00:04:48,246 --> 00:04:50,039
Alex Mosher.

44
00:04:52,250 --> 00:04:53,251
Alex.

45
00:04:56,671 --> 00:04:58,047
Alex!

46
00:05:18,276 --> 00:05:21,362
Please, please.

47
00:05:26,409 --> 00:05:27,243
Boo.

48
00:05:28,578 --> 00:05:30,496
Let's get this over with.
I'm a busy witch.

49
00:05:30,580 --> 00:05:32,123
Are you useful in any way?

50
00:05:32,206 --> 00:05:33,458
Uh, I...

51
00:05:35,501 --> 00:05:36,501
Do you see them?

52
00:05:36,544 --> 00:05:39,339
The apartment lured them in.

53
00:05:40,923 --> 00:05:42,425
That's what the apartment does.

54
00:05:44,802 --> 00:05:45,887
Those children,

55
00:05:46,929 --> 00:05:48,598
they were not useful to me.

56
00:05:49,932 --> 00:05:51,309
Do you understand?

57
00:05:51,392 --> 00:05:52,894
So let's try this again.

58
00:05:52,977 --> 00:05:57,732
Is there anything special
about you at all?

59
00:05:57,815 --> 00:05:59,984
Any reason I should let you live?

60
00:06:01,819 --> 00:06:03,696
And get up.

61
00:06:04,489 --> 00:06:05,489
Come closer.

62
00:06:10,536 --> 00:06:12,580
Goodbye, Alex.

63
00:06:16,626 --> 00:06:20,588
I do write scary stories.

64
00:06:25,885 --> 00:06:29,806
Did you say "scary stories"?

65
00:06:31,974 --> 00:06:33,309
What's... what's that?

66
00:06:35,937 --> 00:06:36,937
No more questions.

67
00:06:38,064 --> 00:06:41,109
My Nightbooks.
It's where I wrote my stories.

68
00:06:42,902 --> 00:06:45,029
What are you doing with these
so late at night?

69
00:06:45,113 --> 00:06:46,155
I was...

70
00:06:47,407 --> 00:06:49,992
I was gonna burn them
in the boiler room downstairs.

71
00:06:50,076 --> 00:06:52,537
Burn them? So they're not any good.

72
00:06:52,620 --> 00:06:54,038
- No.
- Goodbye, Alex.

73
00:06:54,122 --> 00:06:56,374
They're good.
They're very, really, really good.

74
00:06:57,959 --> 00:06:59,210
Nightbooks, huh?

75
00:07:00,753 --> 00:07:03,381
The title better not be
the scariest thing about them.

76
00:07:03,464 --> 00:07:06,551
I'm going to need a story every night.

77
00:07:06,634 --> 00:07:10,596
The story better be good,
and it better be scary,

78
00:07:11,431 --> 00:07:14,100
or it's the last thing
you'll ever do.

79
00:07:54,682 --> 00:07:56,100
Hey.

80
00:08:28,883 --> 00:08:30,843
It's a little kitty.

81
00:08:32,053 --> 00:08:33,638
Mischievous little thing.

82
00:08:35,556 --> 00:08:36,682
How'd you get in here?

83
00:09:20,726 --> 00:09:22,311
What is this place?

84
00:09:40,746 --> 00:09:41,872
Where's the TV?

85
00:09:51,048 --> 00:09:53,259
And where'd the front door go?

86
00:10:26,375 --> 00:10:27,460
Oh my God.

87
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:29,045
You scared me.

88
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:45,436
What?

89
00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:47,772
- You're a kid.
- And you're a genius.

90
00:10:49,106 --> 00:10:50,650
I'm Alex. Who are you?

91
00:10:50,733 --> 00:10:53,069
You're gonna be chatty. Great.

92
00:10:53,694 --> 00:10:54,695
I'm Yasmin.

93
00:10:56,530 --> 00:10:58,074
Are you a prisoner too?

94
00:10:58,574 --> 00:11:00,159
No, I'm on vacation.

95
00:11:00,785 --> 00:11:01,869
Okay, food's here.

96
00:11:02,578 --> 00:11:04,246
Hope you like peanut butter.

97
00:11:04,330 --> 00:11:05,539
I used to.

98
00:11:06,749 --> 00:11:08,876
Anything in these cabinets is off-limits.

99
00:11:08,959 --> 00:11:12,088
Don't ever think
Natacha won't miss this piece of popcorn.

100
00:11:12,171 --> 00:11:14,256
Lenore tells her everything.

101
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:15,925
Come out, you evil skin-bag.

102
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:22,431
And that's the invisible cat?

103
00:11:22,515 --> 00:11:25,643
You say cat.
I say Natacha's little spy-beast.

104
00:11:27,019 --> 00:11:28,270
And Natacha is...

105
00:11:29,438 --> 00:11:32,108
Keep up. Natacha is the witch.

106
00:11:32,191 --> 00:11:35,611
Lenore is that wrinkled, hairless thing
that follows you around all day,

107
00:11:35,695 --> 00:11:37,363
popping up out of nowhere.

108
00:11:37,446 --> 00:11:39,949
She ratted me out
over a stinking cup of noodles.

109
00:11:40,032 --> 00:11:41,075
I hate that cat.

110
00:11:43,494 --> 00:11:46,706
Don't just stand there. Help me
clean this up before Natacha gets home.

111
00:11:49,083 --> 00:11:50,751
Where is she, Natacha?

112
00:11:50,835 --> 00:11:52,878
I don't know where she goes
or what she does,

113
00:11:52,962 --> 00:11:54,547
but she can go anywhere she wants.

114
00:11:54,630 --> 00:11:57,842
Talk about the ultimate passport,
this apartment is it.

115
00:11:57,925 --> 00:12:00,803
Come on. We both have work to do.
I'll get you set up.

116
00:12:00,886 --> 00:12:02,513
Ultimate passport?

117
00:12:02,596 --> 00:12:05,641
The apartment travels
all over the world, luring kids in.

118
00:12:06,142 --> 00:12:08,144
I'm from New York. Brooklyn.

119
00:12:08,227 --> 00:12:11,313
I live in Washington. Washington, DC.

120
00:12:12,273 --> 00:12:14,650
Or I did before.

121
00:12:16,444 --> 00:12:18,279
I wonder if we're still in Brooklyn.

122
00:12:18,362 --> 00:12:19,780
The apartment moves?

123
00:12:20,364 --> 00:12:21,866
When it needs fresh meat.

124
00:12:24,702 --> 00:12:26,120
Not literally. Jeez.

125
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:29,790
Thought you wrote scary stories.

126
00:12:31,876 --> 00:12:32,876
Not anymore.

127
00:12:38,758 --> 00:12:39,758
Ta-da.

128
00:12:49,143 --> 00:12:50,269
Whoa!

129
00:12:52,646 --> 00:12:54,398
This is so cool.

130
00:12:54,899 --> 00:12:57,067
How is...

131
00:12:57,151 --> 00:12:58,986
I mean, wow!

132
00:13:00,154 --> 00:13:01,155
It can't be.

133
00:13:04,158 --> 00:13:05,158
Hello!

134
00:13:09,330 --> 00:13:10,873
How is this even possible?

135
00:13:12,124 --> 00:13:14,043
The apartment can do two things.

136
00:13:16,587 --> 00:13:18,172
It lures suckers like us in,

137
00:13:19,632 --> 00:13:21,091
and it has room to hold...

138
00:13:22,051 --> 00:13:23,719
This is so cool.

139
00:13:23,803 --> 00:13:26,305
...well, anything.

140
00:13:26,806 --> 00:13:28,974
The Empty Classroom
and Other Creepy Stories.

141
00:13:29,475 --> 00:13:31,227
Nightdreams and Daymares.

142
00:13:32,353 --> 00:13:33,521
Whispered Tales.

143
00:13:34,063 --> 00:13:35,731
She does like stories.

144
00:13:36,816 --> 00:13:39,777
I thought you said
you weren't into that kinda stuff anymore.

145
00:13:40,361 --> 00:13:43,697
- I'm not. It's my friend.
- Oh, it's your friend?

146
00:13:43,781 --> 00:13:46,408
He, uh... he'd like all this stuff.

147
00:13:47,993 --> 00:13:49,078
But me? Nah.

148
00:13:49,161 --> 00:13:51,705
- He's, like... he's really lame.
- Yeah, he sounds lame.

149
00:13:52,998 --> 00:13:54,375
Hmm. Cool. Okay, yeah.

150
00:13:54,458 --> 00:13:58,671
So she makes me read her
a stupid scary story every night,

151
00:13:58,754 --> 00:14:01,465
but she says
everything in here's already been read.

152
00:14:04,635 --> 00:14:05,635
Everything?

153
00:14:07,930 --> 00:14:09,849
Good thing you're a storyteller.

154
00:14:11,058 --> 00:14:13,227
She needs you, so get to work.

155
00:14:13,811 --> 00:14:16,397
You heard her.
She wants a scary story tonight.

156
00:14:16,981 --> 00:14:19,191
Every day,
write as many stories as you can.

157
00:14:19,275 --> 00:14:20,192
I don't write...

158
00:14:20,276 --> 00:14:21,360
Cut the crap.

159
00:14:21,443 --> 00:14:24,613
I heard you last night,
talking about your Nightbook thingies.

160
00:14:25,322 --> 00:14:26,490
Oh, those.

161
00:14:27,324 --> 00:14:29,285
I'm over the whole writing thing.

162
00:14:29,368 --> 00:14:32,496
Then you better get over getting over it
and crank out some new tales,

163
00:14:32,580 --> 00:14:33,706
'cause if you don't...

164
00:14:33,789 --> 00:14:35,583
She'll kill me. I know.

165
00:14:36,166 --> 00:14:38,168
You'll be lucky if she kills you.

166
00:14:38,711 --> 00:14:40,212
This is your life now.

167
00:14:40,713 --> 00:14:45,718
Forget your family. Forget your friends.
Focus on being useful to Natacha.

168
00:14:45,801 --> 00:14:46,802
You wanna live?

169
00:14:48,095 --> 00:14:49,805
Write scary stories.

170
00:14:53,434 --> 00:14:55,227
I'm not gonna write anything,

171
00:14:55,769 --> 00:14:57,354
'cause I'm getting out of here.

172
00:14:57,438 --> 00:14:58,647
You're gonna die.

173
00:15:05,362 --> 00:15:07,907
Come on, open.

174
00:15:08,407 --> 00:15:09,450
Where are you?

175
00:15:28,969 --> 00:15:29,969
Another exit.

176
00:16:11,637 --> 00:16:12,637
Damn.

177
00:16:14,056 --> 00:16:15,265
Every time.

178
00:16:15,975 --> 00:16:18,769
You all try and run.

179
00:16:18,852 --> 00:16:20,396
There's no escape.

180
00:16:21,647 --> 00:16:22,773
You understand?

181
00:16:24,942 --> 00:16:26,652
You understand?

182
00:16:43,210 --> 00:16:48,215
Hmm. Were you purposely making me wait?

183
00:16:50,092 --> 00:16:52,803
- No. I... I was doing the dishes.
- Sit there.

184
00:17:05,941 --> 00:17:09,111
Should I just start reading?

185
00:17:19,788 --> 00:17:21,874
Give me a minute to get settled.

186
00:17:21,957 --> 00:17:23,208
I mean, honestly!

187
00:17:31,050 --> 00:17:31,967
What is that?

188
00:17:32,051 --> 00:17:36,430
Do you know what happens to children
who ask too many questions?

189
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:40,267
Do you wanna find out?

190
00:17:49,651 --> 00:17:51,987
So, Storyteller,

191
00:17:52,738 --> 00:17:56,200
you tried to escape today.

192
00:17:57,618 --> 00:18:01,789
Yasmin, too,
had a little rebellious streak.

193
00:18:02,372 --> 00:18:05,876
But I am curious about one thing.

194
00:18:06,418 --> 00:18:11,548
Why burn your stories?

195
00:18:17,888 --> 00:18:19,389
What is that?

196
00:18:20,516 --> 00:18:22,101
Read. Now.

197
00:18:29,858 --> 00:18:32,111
"When...
when Todd's best friend Jenny died,

198
00:18:32,194 --> 00:18:34,530
his heart shattered
into a thousand pieces."

199
00:18:34,613 --> 00:18:36,865
Shattered heart? I like it already.

200
00:18:44,123 --> 00:18:46,875
"Everyone avoided
the Foster Playground at night."

201
00:18:46,959 --> 00:18:48,293
"They all knew the legend."

202
00:18:48,377 --> 00:18:51,797
"In the hour before daylight,
the dead kids would come out and play."

203
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:54,299
Nope. No, no, no. Sorry, nope.

204
00:18:54,383 --> 00:18:58,220
Everyone knows that ghosts haunt places
that are personal to them,

205
00:18:58,303 --> 00:19:00,180
not public places.

206
00:19:00,264 --> 00:19:02,266
Uh, are... are you sure?

207
00:19:03,725 --> 00:19:05,185
I'm sure.

208
00:19:07,146 --> 00:19:08,313
Get on with it.

209
00:19:09,231 --> 00:19:12,776
"Todd walks to the playground.
He gets to the gate."

210
00:19:13,485 --> 00:19:16,238
"And as soon as his foot
crosses the threshold,

211
00:19:17,072 --> 00:19:18,240
children..."

212
00:19:18,782 --> 00:19:22,161
"...squealing, playing."

213
00:19:24,413 --> 00:19:27,374
"Suddenly, a boy shoots out of the slide."

214
00:19:27,457 --> 00:19:31,420
"Maybe he's ten or so,
dressed like a newsie from the '20s."

215
00:19:31,503 --> 00:19:33,338
Rude. You could at least say hi.

216
00:19:33,422 --> 00:19:34,422
Hey... hey.

217
00:19:34,798 --> 00:19:36,091
I... I mean... I mean hi.

218
00:19:37,384 --> 00:19:39,094
I'm looking for my friend, Jenny.

219
00:19:39,178 --> 00:19:41,805
"...Todd says,
while looking for any sign of her."

220
00:19:43,182 --> 00:19:45,350
To find her, you have to play.

221
00:19:45,434 --> 00:19:49,188
"The newsie whistles,
and half a dozen dead kids surround Todd."

222
00:19:49,271 --> 00:19:53,692
"Their skin is deathly white.
Some of their clothes date back decades."

223
00:19:53,775 --> 00:19:56,278
"They push Todd on a swing,
higher and higher..."

224
00:19:56,361 --> 00:19:57,446
Stupid!

225
00:19:57,529 --> 00:20:01,491
Everyone knows
ghosts don't have actual physical hands,

226
00:20:01,575 --> 00:20:04,328
so they could never push him on a swing.

227
00:20:04,411 --> 00:20:05,412
Amateur.

228
00:20:09,124 --> 00:20:11,960
The playground is...
it's an interdimensional plane,

229
00:20:12,044 --> 00:20:14,421
a mix between
the spirit world and the real world.

230
00:20:14,504 --> 00:20:17,299
Oh, so you're a quantum physicist now?

231
00:20:20,260 --> 00:20:22,638
Whatever. Continue.

232
00:20:25,766 --> 00:20:27,976
"And then the children laugh,

233
00:20:28,060 --> 00:20:30,479
and they pull Todd
to a rusty merry-go-round."

234
00:20:30,562 --> 00:20:34,024
"They spin him around and around,
faster and faster,

235
00:20:34,107 --> 00:20:35,776
making Todd dizzier and dizzier."

236
00:20:35,859 --> 00:20:38,320
"Then the ghosts force Todd
onto a seesaw."

237
00:20:38,403 --> 00:20:39,571
"He holds on tight."

238
00:20:39,655 --> 00:20:41,823
"Suddenly, Todd realizes
what they're up to."

239
00:20:41,907 --> 00:20:45,327
"Any living child still on the playground
when the sun rises

240
00:20:45,410 --> 00:20:48,247
is cursed to remain there forever."

241
00:20:48,330 --> 00:20:51,166
"He stumbles towards the gate,
desperate to get out,

242
00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:54,378
but his world is spinning,
and he's tripping over his own feet."

243
00:20:54,461 --> 00:20:57,172
"The sun's almost up.
He's nearly out of time."

244
00:20:57,256 --> 00:20:59,716
"All the ghost children
watch in suspense."

245
00:21:00,384 --> 00:21:02,010
"Todd's not going to make it."

246
00:21:02,094 --> 00:21:05,180
"Until suddenly, someone grabs him
and pulls him towards the exit."

247
00:21:05,264 --> 00:21:06,390
"It's Jenny!"

248
00:21:07,724 --> 00:21:10,018
"'Jenny, I... I wanted to see you.'"

249
00:21:10,102 --> 00:21:11,853
"'Get out of here, ' Jenny says,

250
00:21:11,937 --> 00:21:13,855
not stopping for a happy reunion."

251
00:21:17,150 --> 00:21:19,903
"Seeing his old friend again
makes Todd's heart hurt."

252
00:21:19,987 --> 00:21:22,572
I miss you. I don't wanna let you go.

253
00:21:22,656 --> 00:21:23,782
"But in death,

254
00:21:23,865 --> 00:21:26,785
Jenny discovered something
that Todd is about to learn."

255
00:21:26,868 --> 00:21:28,662
Friends never let go, Todd.

256
00:21:30,205 --> 00:21:32,040
"Because friends never forget."

257
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,835
I'll always be with you,

258
00:21:35,669 --> 00:21:36,669
here.

259
00:21:56,898 --> 00:21:58,442
A happy ending?

260
00:21:59,860 --> 00:22:02,863
Are you out of your mind?

261
00:22:02,946 --> 00:22:04,740
No happy endings, you fool.

262
00:22:08,118 --> 00:22:11,496
Jenny... Jenny's dead. She's... she's trapped
on the playground forever.

263
00:22:11,580 --> 00:22:13,999
It's not happy for her.

264
00:22:14,624 --> 00:22:17,294
Ghostly hands go on Todd's back.

265
00:22:17,377 --> 00:22:19,671
He... he... he glances behind him,

266
00:22:19,755 --> 00:22:22,007
and he's pulled into the playground.

267
00:22:22,090 --> 00:22:24,676
He... he screams for help, but it's no use.

268
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:27,846
His ghostly soul is trapped there
to this very day.

269
00:22:43,070 --> 00:22:46,239
Happy endings are a dangerous thing.

270
00:22:47,157 --> 00:22:48,283
Never forget that.

271
00:22:49,576 --> 00:22:53,163
Did you at least like the story?
I mean, until the ending?

272
00:22:53,246 --> 00:22:57,084
Writers, always so insecure.

273
00:22:57,167 --> 00:22:59,503
You're still alive, aren't you?

274
00:23:11,264 --> 00:23:14,226
I'm mystified by you, Storyteller.

275
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:21,400
This beautiful darkness
dances inside your brain.

276
00:23:22,025 --> 00:23:23,693
You should celebrate it.

277
00:23:24,861 --> 00:23:26,071
But you run from it.

278
00:23:26,571 --> 00:23:27,571
Why?

279
00:23:29,658 --> 00:23:30,742
I just...

280
00:23:32,869 --> 00:23:35,122
I... I wanna be like everyone else.

281
00:23:38,959 --> 00:23:40,544
You wrote all this today?

282
00:23:40,627 --> 00:23:43,922
Uh, I had... I had trouble writing today.

283
00:23:44,506 --> 00:23:45,507
What?

284
00:23:45,590 --> 00:23:49,428
It's just hard to concentrate
with someone staring at me all day.

285
00:23:52,973 --> 00:23:57,102
I told you, show him the library
and then get out.

286
00:23:57,185 --> 00:23:58,061
Wait! Wait!

287
00:24:00,230 --> 00:24:01,481
Not her! Not her.

288
00:24:03,650 --> 00:24:05,402
You were disturbing him.

289
00:24:05,485 --> 00:24:09,322
It is very important that he writes.

290
00:24:09,406 --> 00:24:11,992
You know how important it is.

291
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:14,411
Wait!

292
00:24:17,456 --> 00:24:19,291
It... it wasn't her fault either.

293
00:24:23,378 --> 00:24:27,048
Well, if it wasn't Yasmin's fault,
and it wasn't Lenore's fault,

294
00:24:27,132 --> 00:24:30,302
then whose fault was it?

295
00:24:31,761 --> 00:24:35,098
Mine. I'll... I'll write faster.

296
00:24:36,766 --> 00:24:39,102
Lenore won't bother you again.

297
00:24:39,603 --> 00:24:41,605
No more excuses, Storyteller.

298
00:24:50,947 --> 00:24:52,866
Are you okay?

299
00:24:54,367 --> 00:24:55,535
Leave me alone.

300
00:24:55,619 --> 00:24:58,705
Yasmin, I'm sorry.

301
00:24:58,788 --> 00:25:01,333
I wasn't trying to get you
in any kind of trouble.

302
00:25:01,416 --> 00:25:05,378
Yasmin, I'm sorry. I didn't know
about the "no happy endings" thing.

303
00:25:07,589 --> 00:25:09,674
Todd shouldn't have gone back for Jenny.

304
00:25:11,635 --> 00:25:13,970
- He was stupid.
- No, he wasn't.

305
00:25:14,054 --> 00:25:16,306
He was her friend,
and that's what friends do.

306
00:25:16,806 --> 00:25:18,517
Maybe in fairy tales.

307
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:21,269
But in here? She's right, you know.

308
00:25:22,479 --> 00:25:24,189
Happy endings don't exist.

309
00:25:44,084 --> 00:25:45,084
What?

310
00:25:45,418 --> 00:25:46,836
What... what is that?

311
00:26:06,356 --> 00:26:07,649
This place sucks.

312
00:26:13,154 --> 00:26:16,491
She wants stories?
Fine. I'll give her some stories.

313
00:26:27,419 --> 00:26:29,588
Yes! Yes, a haunted desk!

314
00:26:29,671 --> 00:26:32,757
Haunted by the spirit
of somebody who died working at it.

315
00:26:32,841 --> 00:26:35,468
No, no, it's stupid.
They're gonna think it's stupid.

316
00:26:35,552 --> 00:26:37,220
How long you been here for?

317
00:26:37,721 --> 00:26:38,972
Looks like a while.

318
00:26:39,681 --> 00:26:40,974
How'd they get you?

319
00:26:41,057 --> 00:26:43,893
They got me
with a piece of pie and Lost Boys.

320
00:26:51,568 --> 00:26:53,028
Once upon a time,

321
00:26:53,570 --> 00:26:55,780
Alex stared up at the ceiling.

322
00:26:56,281 --> 00:26:58,742
Then the ceiling fell on him

323
00:26:59,909 --> 00:27:01,828
and put him out of his misery.

324
00:27:02,454 --> 00:27:03,454
The end.

325
00:27:09,586 --> 00:27:10,629
What's up there?

326
00:27:46,498 --> 00:27:48,208
It's the oldest book in here.

327
00:27:48,958 --> 00:27:51,544
This thing's gotta be,
like, a thousand years old.

328
00:27:56,508 --> 00:28:00,095
"Kinder und Hausmärchen."

329
00:28:06,184 --> 00:28:07,352
"Rumpelstiltskin."

330
00:28:11,981 --> 00:28:13,566
"Sleeping Beauty"?

331
00:28:15,318 --> 00:28:16,318
Wow!

332
00:28:20,115 --> 00:28:21,449
"Hansel and Gretel."

333
00:28:23,868 --> 00:28:25,745
Is that a ballpoint pen?

334
00:29:00,029 --> 00:29:01,531
Wow. "Frankenstein."

335
00:29:10,248 --> 00:29:11,416
Oh my God.

336
00:29:13,501 --> 00:29:14,501
It's writing.

337
00:29:17,380 --> 00:29:21,009
"If I don't make it out of here,
I need someone to know what happened,

338
00:29:21,092 --> 00:29:23,720
even if it's only
the characters in these books."

339
00:29:23,803 --> 00:29:25,221
"I saw a unicorn."

340
00:29:25,847 --> 00:29:28,183
"People said they didn't exist,
but there it was."

341
00:29:28,266 --> 00:29:32,437
"I followed it into this apartment,
and now I'm trapped by a witch."

342
00:29:33,021 --> 00:29:34,564
"She's mean and scary."

343
00:29:46,409 --> 00:29:49,120
"I just have to do
what the witch tells me to

344
00:29:49,204 --> 00:29:51,164
until Mom and Dad find me."

345
00:29:51,247 --> 00:29:54,209
"There are other kids here.
Most of them are nice."

346
00:29:54,292 --> 00:29:57,170
"I'm scared, but at least I'm not alone."

347
00:30:03,343 --> 00:30:04,511
Dinner in an hour.

348
00:30:04,594 --> 00:30:06,179
Hey, Yasmin,

349
00:30:06,805 --> 00:30:08,139
do you like unicorns?

350
00:30:09,390 --> 00:30:11,518
Yeah, 'cause that's so me.

351
00:30:11,601 --> 00:30:15,230
Oh, I thought maybe
that's how she got you.

352
00:30:16,022 --> 00:30:17,357
Natacha, I mean.

353
00:30:18,066 --> 00:30:20,026
You're right. It's none of my business.

354
00:30:20,109 --> 00:30:24,072
And I bet you weren't lured in
by a stupid movie and a piece of pie.

355
00:30:24,656 --> 00:30:26,115
Stupid pumpkin pie.

356
00:30:28,743 --> 00:30:29,786
Fine.

357
00:30:30,954 --> 00:30:32,288
It was doro wat.

358
00:30:33,623 --> 00:30:35,333
What the hell is doro wat?

359
00:30:36,459 --> 00:30:41,214
Chicken, onions caramelized
in spiced butter, paprika, garlic,

360
00:30:41,297 --> 00:30:43,508
ginger, berbere spice.

361
00:30:44,717 --> 00:30:45,717
My āyatē...

362
00:30:46,594 --> 00:30:49,556
My grandmother and I
used to make it before she died.

363
00:30:50,807 --> 00:30:53,309
We even grew all the herbs
and veggies ourselves.

364
00:30:54,727 --> 00:30:57,146
Anyways, I smelled doro wat,

365
00:30:57,230 --> 00:31:01,442
and I just so badly wanted
to see my āyatē again.

366
00:31:05,697 --> 00:31:06,781
But it wasn't her.

367
00:31:08,199 --> 00:31:09,325
It was a witch,

368
00:31:09,409 --> 00:31:11,911
an evil, wicked witch.

369
00:31:14,664 --> 00:31:16,332
How's that for a happy ending?

370
00:31:33,683 --> 00:31:35,768
"With the fangs came the hunger,

371
00:31:35,852 --> 00:31:38,396
and Katie discovered
that her hunch was right."

372
00:31:38,479 --> 00:31:41,482
"To a vampire,
blood does taste like candy."

373
00:31:41,566 --> 00:31:46,738
Everybody knows
it takes two days to grow full fangs.

374
00:31:46,821 --> 00:31:48,239
You're stupid.

375
00:31:54,412 --> 00:31:56,664
Here, Lenore, a peace offering.

376
00:32:05,715 --> 00:32:06,966
Story.

377
00:32:09,093 --> 00:32:12,263
There's gotta be more writing
from that Unicorn Girl.

378
00:32:12,347 --> 00:32:15,183
"...but it's too late.
The roller coaster plunges down the drop."

379
00:32:15,266 --> 00:32:18,478
"Steel snaps, metal shrieks,

380
00:32:20,355 --> 00:32:21,689
humans scream,

381
00:32:22,649 --> 00:32:25,818
and the grim reaper's dog laughs
at the carnage."

382
00:32:26,569 --> 00:32:29,739
The grim reaper doesn't have a pet.

383
00:32:30,406 --> 00:32:31,950
Isn't that right, Lenore?

384
00:32:46,047 --> 00:32:47,757
This is gonna take forever!

385
00:33:04,607 --> 00:33:08,277
"They saw their son's footprints
in the snow, leading into the woods."

386
00:33:08,361 --> 00:33:11,280
"Then they saw
a pair of smaller footprints,

387
00:33:11,364 --> 00:33:12,532
teddy-bear-sized."

388
00:33:13,574 --> 00:33:16,035
"And they never saw
their precious son again."

389
00:33:16,536 --> 00:33:19,372
Possessed teddy bears? Really?

390
00:33:19,956 --> 00:33:21,874
Took me right out of the story.

391
00:33:21,958 --> 00:33:26,045
Every good story hints at truth.

392
00:33:26,629 --> 00:33:29,799
The more truth,
the more powerful the story.

393
00:33:30,591 --> 00:33:34,512
From now on, get your facts straight.

394
00:33:46,899 --> 00:33:47,899
Yes!

395
00:33:50,820 --> 00:33:53,281
"I don't know how long I've been here."

396
00:33:53,364 --> 00:33:56,367
"I still have the necklace
Mom and Dad gave me."

397
00:33:56,951 --> 00:33:59,245
"I used to touch it to remember them,

398
00:33:59,328 --> 00:34:00,955
but I stopped."

399
00:34:01,039 --> 00:34:02,665
"It made me cry."

400
00:34:03,166 --> 00:34:04,584
"I'm tired of crying."

401
00:34:07,628 --> 00:34:09,881
"I have what I need to escape tonight."

402
00:34:09,964 --> 00:34:12,675
"I'm finally going to see them again,
Mom and Dad."

403
00:34:12,759 --> 00:34:14,635
"I wonder if they'll even know me."

404
00:34:14,719 --> 00:34:16,596
"Can people forget their kids?"

405
00:34:19,015 --> 00:34:20,391
- "Escape"?
- Alex?

406
00:34:22,935 --> 00:34:24,604
Oh my God!

407
00:34:29,067 --> 00:34:31,277
You did not just throw a book at me!

408
00:34:31,360 --> 00:34:33,154
Uh, no. You just surprised me.

409
00:34:33,237 --> 00:34:34,238
I dropped it.

410
00:34:34,322 --> 00:34:36,282
Hold on. I'm coming down.

411
00:34:38,117 --> 00:34:41,954
Hey, Yasmin,
wait until you see what I found.

412
00:34:43,998 --> 00:34:46,250
Hey, what's wrong?

413
00:34:58,763 --> 00:35:00,515
This is Natacha's night nursery.

414
00:35:00,598 --> 00:35:01,641
Night nursery?

415
00:35:01,724 --> 00:35:04,352
Yeah. Sunlight is bad for magical plants.

416
00:35:04,435 --> 00:35:05,435
Come on.

417
00:35:22,912 --> 00:35:24,539
What's all this for?

418
00:35:25,123 --> 00:35:27,667
Ingredients mostly, for Natacha's potions.

419
00:35:32,505 --> 00:35:34,423
Don't touch anything.

420
00:35:39,053 --> 00:35:40,053
What's that?

421
00:35:40,596 --> 00:35:41,848
Demon silk.

422
00:35:41,931 --> 00:35:44,058
Enough questions. Help me with this.

423
00:35:44,142 --> 00:35:47,186
I watered the vine with rat's blood
instead of bat's blood.

424
00:35:47,270 --> 00:35:50,690
Now, Shredder eggs are growing on it.
If one of them hatches,

425
00:35:50,773 --> 00:35:53,484
it can destroy the night nursery,
and Natacha will kill me.

426
00:35:57,488 --> 00:35:59,949
I'm taking care of it, Lenore.

427
00:36:22,096 --> 00:36:26,100
Okay.
Put it gently on the ground.

428
00:36:27,143 --> 00:36:28,644
Be careful. Don't jostle it.

429
00:36:29,395 --> 00:36:30,229
Be careful.

430
00:36:35,818 --> 00:36:37,737
Okay, now what?

431
00:36:38,863 --> 00:36:41,449
Stomp it as hard as you can.

432
00:36:48,331 --> 00:36:49,332
Good.

433
00:36:55,671 --> 00:36:58,132
Where's the blue mist come from?
Do you make it?

434
00:36:58,216 --> 00:37:00,259
The mist,
do you think it keeps Natacha young?

435
00:37:00,343 --> 00:37:03,054
It's none of our business.

436
00:37:03,137 --> 00:37:06,098
I mean, she's really pretty,
but her books are ancient,

437
00:37:06,182 --> 00:37:08,601
and the apartment looks like
a granny decorated it.

438
00:37:17,401 --> 00:37:20,613
No!

439
00:37:25,326 --> 00:37:26,911
I thought for sure it was gonna...

440
00:37:45,429 --> 00:37:47,682
No!

441
00:37:49,850 --> 00:37:52,103
Did you get it?

442
00:37:52,979 --> 00:37:54,105
It's getting away!

443
00:37:56,774 --> 00:37:57,858
- No! No!
- No!

444
00:37:58,651 --> 00:38:01,696
It's cutting down the Shredder eggs!
Stomp on them!

445
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:17,003
Sorry.

446
00:38:20,840 --> 00:38:22,675
That's all the Shredder eggs.

447
00:38:24,677 --> 00:38:27,096
There it is!
Don't let it get away!

448
00:38:32,935 --> 00:38:34,478
Alex, look out!

449
00:38:37,481 --> 00:38:38,481
Thanks, Yas.

450
00:38:38,899 --> 00:38:40,693
I mean, Yasmin.

451
00:38:43,070 --> 00:38:45,239
Wait. Where is it?

452
00:38:56,917 --> 00:39:00,004
We need to find it and kill it
before it destroys the whole place.

453
00:39:08,637 --> 00:39:10,598
Well, that's just great!

454
00:39:45,633 --> 00:39:47,510
Get it off me!

455
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:54,183
Oh God!

456
00:39:54,266 --> 00:39:57,645
Oh God.

457
00:39:57,728 --> 00:39:59,855
I'm okay. I'm okay. I'm okay.

458
00:40:19,750 --> 00:40:20,918
It's gone.

459
00:40:21,669 --> 00:40:23,921
I don't know where it went.

460
00:40:44,442 --> 00:40:45,442
Let's go!

461
00:40:47,445 --> 00:40:48,654
- Come on!
- Wait.

462
00:41:11,635 --> 00:41:12,636
Gotcha.

463
00:41:13,512 --> 00:41:15,014
Now let's get out of here.

464
00:41:54,512 --> 00:42:00,392
You useless little twits.

465
00:42:01,477 --> 00:42:04,647
You've been misbehaving in my garden.

466
00:42:05,773 --> 00:42:10,653
This will hurt you
far more than it hurts me.

467
00:42:10,736 --> 00:42:13,781
Please, I... I can explain.

468
00:42:13,864 --> 00:42:16,617
And I would let you

469
00:42:16,700 --> 00:42:17,952
if I cared.

470
00:42:19,537 --> 00:42:21,705
Do try to keep your eyes open.

471
00:42:22,748 --> 00:42:25,042
I would hate to have to start over.

472
00:42:30,714 --> 00:42:35,344
Can't you do anything right?
I said keep your eyes open!

473
00:42:41,850 --> 00:42:43,185
It was my fault!

474
00:42:44,311 --> 00:42:46,272
I begged Yasmin to take me to the nursery.

475
00:42:46,355 --> 00:42:50,234
I thought the creepy plants might help me
think of something cool to write about.

476
00:42:51,610 --> 00:42:54,780
She made me promise
not to touch anything, but I did.

477
00:42:57,241 --> 00:42:59,535
Don't hurt her. Please.

478
00:43:11,755 --> 00:43:14,925
That is very brave of you, Storyteller,

479
00:43:15,676 --> 00:43:18,345
to lie right to my face.

480
00:43:28,439 --> 00:43:29,857
I almost killed you.

481
00:43:32,484 --> 00:43:35,070
If I didn't need you
to clean up the mess, I would've.

482
00:43:35,821 --> 00:43:37,323
No more chances.

483
00:43:43,329 --> 00:43:46,123
Yas, you okay?

484
00:43:46,707 --> 00:43:47,707
Look,

485
00:43:49,168 --> 00:43:51,211
I'm sorry I got you involved.

486
00:43:53,380 --> 00:43:56,884
From now on,
you help yourself. I'll help myself.

487
00:43:57,384 --> 00:44:02,681
Yas, we can get out of here, together.

488
00:44:02,765 --> 00:44:04,141
It's not Yas.

489
00:44:09,021 --> 00:44:10,105
It's Yasmin.

490
00:45:10,999 --> 00:45:13,210
Shredder!

491
00:45:28,559 --> 00:45:30,227
Gotcha!

492
00:45:30,310 --> 00:45:32,146
Okay.

493
00:45:36,692 --> 00:45:39,111
Here we go. Okay.

494
00:45:39,653 --> 00:45:40,529
One...

495
00:45:40,612 --> 00:45:42,656
...two,

496
00:45:44,074 --> 00:45:45,074
three!

497
00:45:50,706 --> 00:45:54,084
Get... get off me! Get off me! Get off!

498
00:45:55,335 --> 00:45:57,421
No! No! No!

499
00:46:10,017 --> 00:46:11,059
Oh my God.

500
00:46:11,143 --> 00:46:13,771
No! No! No! No! No! No! No!

501
00:46:17,858 --> 00:46:19,693
Ugh! My Nightbooks.

502
00:46:41,632 --> 00:46:43,133
Watch out.

503
00:46:43,217 --> 00:46:44,802
Lenore's here somewhere.

504
00:46:45,552 --> 00:46:48,222
- She's hurting.
- You look terrible.

505
00:46:48,806 --> 00:46:52,267
- You've been here all night?
- Yeah, all night.

506
00:46:53,727 --> 00:46:56,814
I made this.
It'll help with the scrapes and cuts.

507
00:47:00,651 --> 00:47:03,153
You made this for me?

508
00:47:04,780 --> 00:47:06,532
Yeah, it's my own concoction.

509
00:47:07,658 --> 00:47:11,036
It's a kind of aloe from a harpy plant,
some dried corpse-hair vine.

510
00:47:13,956 --> 00:47:16,375
That's good. Really good.

511
00:47:16,458 --> 00:47:17,458
Thanks.

512
00:47:19,586 --> 00:47:20,963
Uh, Lenore?

513
00:47:22,214 --> 00:47:25,425
Come here.

514
00:47:27,469 --> 00:47:29,137
Look what Yas made for us.

515
00:47:29,221 --> 00:47:30,764
Didn't make it for her.

516
00:47:31,515 --> 00:47:33,892
There you go, all better.

517
00:47:33,976 --> 00:47:35,394
It's okay. Here we go.

518
00:47:35,477 --> 00:47:36,477
No.

519
00:47:43,068 --> 00:47:44,319
I'm in trouble.

520
00:47:44,403 --> 00:47:46,697
I... I... I don't have any stories.

521
00:47:46,780 --> 00:47:49,908
What do you mean you don't have any?
You said you had a bunch of them.

522
00:47:49,992 --> 00:47:52,452
I did, but a Shredder,
it got into my room.

523
00:47:52,536 --> 00:47:56,498
And I killed it,
but it destroyed all of my Nightbooks,

524
00:47:56,582 --> 00:47:57,749
except for this one.

525
00:47:57,833 --> 00:48:00,377
I was reading to Natacha
from those Nightbooks.

526
00:48:00,460 --> 00:48:04,464
I've got nothing now.
I... I have to escape. I have no choice!

527
00:48:04,548 --> 00:48:08,010
There are two ways out. The front door
where you came in and the back door...

528
00:48:08,093 --> 00:48:12,347
The back door! It goes outside.
I saw Natacha go through there. There's...

529
00:48:12,431 --> 00:48:15,183
But Natacha's the only one
that has the keys to that door.

530
00:48:15,267 --> 00:48:18,061
You need to get over
this escape nonsense and write something.

531
00:48:18,145 --> 00:48:20,105
- I've been trying!
- Try harder!

532
00:48:20,188 --> 00:48:21,815
I can't write!

533
00:48:23,025 --> 00:48:26,153
Look, Natacha will find out tonight.

534
00:48:26,236 --> 00:48:29,531
- I'll be useless to her. She'll kill me.
- She won't just kill you.

535
00:48:37,331 --> 00:48:38,707
There were four of us.

536
00:48:38,790 --> 00:48:41,585
Eli, Little Hwan, Claire,

537
00:48:42,252 --> 00:48:43,252
and me.

538
00:48:45,047 --> 00:48:48,842
Hwan was too young, but the rest of us
took turns reading to Natacha.

539
00:48:50,135 --> 00:48:52,763
Afterwards,
we'd all huddle together at night

540
00:48:54,514 --> 00:48:56,183
and dream about escaping.

541
00:48:56,892 --> 00:48:59,353
You're saying these are...

542
00:49:03,148 --> 00:49:05,108
Last night, I almost joined them.

543
00:49:06,693 --> 00:49:08,946
One day, the kitchen sink got clogged.

544
00:49:10,280 --> 00:49:12,199
Natacha's magic couldn't fix it.

545
00:49:15,369 --> 00:49:18,956
That's because I blocked the pipe myself
with starstell moss.

546
00:49:21,625 --> 00:49:23,210
The moss resists magic.

547
00:49:25,921 --> 00:49:29,424
I wanted to force Natacha
to call the plumber.

548
00:49:33,011 --> 00:49:35,806
I taped a note under the sink
for him to find,

549
00:49:35,889 --> 00:49:37,432
begging him to get help.

550
00:49:38,809 --> 00:49:39,809
But...

551
00:49:41,853 --> 00:49:42,980
he never came.

552
00:49:44,982 --> 00:49:47,192
Natacha found the note, didn't she?

553
00:49:47,275 --> 00:49:51,154
Claire spent her last moments
convincing Natacha that she did it...

554
00:49:53,198 --> 00:49:54,198
not me.

555
00:49:57,119 --> 00:50:00,038
Claire lied to save me.

556
00:50:02,499 --> 00:50:05,419
Like... you did.

557
00:50:07,796 --> 00:50:09,589
'Cause that's what friends do.

558
00:50:14,678 --> 00:50:18,348
I used to love writing scary stories,

559
00:50:18,432 --> 00:50:22,519
but then I decided to stop.

560
00:50:22,602 --> 00:50:25,230
And now that I have to write...

561
00:50:27,858 --> 00:50:30,235
the... the ideas won't come to me anymore.

562
00:50:39,244 --> 00:50:40,704
Did Hwan wear a watch?

563
00:50:42,581 --> 00:50:45,125
Yeah.
A big, blue plastic one. Why?

564
00:50:45,709 --> 00:50:49,671
- And Claire, those earrings?
- They were her aunt's.

565
00:50:51,048 --> 00:50:52,048
Why?

566
00:50:53,675 --> 00:50:55,761
There's a way out of this place.

567
00:50:55,844 --> 00:50:59,306
- "I have what I need to escape tonight."
- "Escape," Yasmin.

568
00:50:59,389 --> 00:51:02,059
"I'm finally gonna see them again,
Mom and Dad."

569
00:51:02,142 --> 00:51:04,352
"I wonder if they'll remember me."

570
00:51:04,436 --> 00:51:06,396
"Can people forget their kids?"

571
00:51:07,856 --> 00:51:09,816
Unicorn Girl never took this off,

572
00:51:09,900 --> 00:51:12,319
and none of the kids in the cabinet
are wearing it.

573
00:51:15,530 --> 00:51:18,617
You're right.
And if she's not in the cabinet, then...

574
00:51:18,700 --> 00:51:20,911
She did it. She escaped.

575
00:51:20,994 --> 00:51:24,039
I've been piecing together her notes.
There are bits here and there.

576
00:51:24,122 --> 00:51:27,042
She hid them throughout the books,
so in case Natacha found out...

577
00:51:27,125 --> 00:51:28,960
She wouldn't know her full plan.

578
00:51:32,297 --> 00:51:33,673
Okay, what's your plan?

579
00:51:35,675 --> 00:51:38,178
Your plan sucks.
We're not gonna find this today.

580
00:51:38,261 --> 00:51:40,013
You need to write a story for tonight.

581
00:51:40,097 --> 00:51:41,807
Like right now.

582
00:51:41,890 --> 00:51:43,183
What do we do?

583
00:51:43,266 --> 00:51:46,770
It'd take, like, a thousand years
to search all these books.

584
00:51:49,940 --> 00:51:51,024
A thousand years.

585
00:51:52,317 --> 00:51:53,985
The thousand-year-old book.

586
00:51:55,320 --> 00:51:57,572
The pen marks in the old book!

587
00:52:10,043 --> 00:52:12,838
Come on. Please be here.

588
00:52:15,465 --> 00:52:17,634
Is this the original "Hansel and Gretel"?

589
00:52:17,717 --> 00:52:19,261
Grimm's Fairy Tales.

590
00:52:19,344 --> 00:52:21,263
That's totally unrealistic.

591
00:52:21,346 --> 00:52:24,057
No one would just eat candy
off of a strange house.

592
00:52:27,727 --> 00:52:29,437
I was right! More writing!

593
00:52:29,521 --> 00:52:31,690
It's a recipe
for a sleeping potion.

594
00:52:34,359 --> 00:52:35,443
"It smells awful."

595
00:52:35,527 --> 00:52:38,572
"I need to figure out
how to hide the stink so she'll drink it."

596
00:52:38,655 --> 00:52:41,825
"I'm so close.
I'll put her to sleep and steal her keys."

597
00:52:41,908 --> 00:52:43,368
"I wish I had magic."

598
00:52:43,451 --> 00:52:46,788
"I'd turn her into a toad or a snail
and laugh at her all day long."

599
00:52:46,872 --> 00:52:50,167
"Then I would turn her into a centipede
and rip off her legs."

600
00:52:50,250 --> 00:52:51,960
"All hundred legs,

601
00:52:52,043 --> 00:52:53,044
one at a time."

602
00:52:55,463 --> 00:52:58,175
I'll keep looking.
You have to write a story.

603
00:52:59,801 --> 00:53:01,845
I don't think I can.

604
00:53:01,928 --> 00:53:04,806
You're the only one who can.
You've gotta buy us more time.

605
00:53:06,016 --> 00:53:07,559
You don't think I'm weird?

606
00:53:11,479 --> 00:53:12,479
That I...

607
00:53:13,857 --> 00:53:16,234
I like to write scary stories?

608
00:53:17,903 --> 00:53:18,903
Weird?

609
00:53:20,363 --> 00:53:21,823
Who called you that?

610
00:53:23,617 --> 00:53:25,702
Well, they're right. You are weird.

611
00:53:27,370 --> 00:53:28,788
I mean, look at you.

612
00:53:30,665 --> 00:53:34,377
But the thing that makes you weird
makes them ordinary.

613
00:53:35,253 --> 00:53:38,131
And no one likes to be ordinary.
Ordinary sucks.

614
00:53:38,215 --> 00:53:41,551
So ordinary people are gonna try
and take that away from you...

615
00:53:43,553 --> 00:53:45,180
by calling you names like

616
00:53:46,932 --> 00:53:49,476
- Tryhard or...
- Creepshow.

617
00:53:52,103 --> 00:53:54,231
Yeah, or Creepshow.

618
00:53:58,360 --> 00:53:59,444
Thanks, Yasmin.

619
00:54:02,739 --> 00:54:03,739
It's Yas.

620
00:54:07,118 --> 00:54:08,745
Do you have those ingredients?

621
00:54:09,704 --> 00:54:11,122
Yeah. Yeah, I do.

622
00:54:11,206 --> 00:54:13,792
But she's right. Suckleweed stinks.

623
00:54:14,960 --> 00:54:16,586
How did she mask the smell?

624
00:54:17,087 --> 00:54:19,297
She must've found another ingredient.

625
00:54:19,798 --> 00:54:22,634
The only other person
who would know is Natacha,

626
00:54:22,717 --> 00:54:24,219
but she would never tell us.

627
00:54:25,929 --> 00:54:27,138
I do have an idea.

628
00:54:27,806 --> 00:54:30,058
I could write a story
to trick her into giving us

629
00:54:30,141 --> 00:54:32,269
the final ingredient
of the sleeping potion.

630
00:54:32,352 --> 00:54:35,397
You know what happens
if she figures out what we're up to?

631
00:54:35,480 --> 00:54:37,399
I know what happens
if we don't try.

632
00:54:37,482 --> 00:54:39,317
What's the name of the story?

633
00:54:45,156 --> 00:54:46,408
Not that one.

634
00:54:47,158 --> 00:54:48,702
You're happy with that one.

635
00:54:51,037 --> 00:54:52,580
I don't like you happy.

636
00:54:53,164 --> 00:54:56,751
I want a story that'll make you squirm.

637
00:54:58,086 --> 00:54:59,879
Here's the story I want.

638
00:55:01,589 --> 00:55:04,718
Why burn your Nightbooks?

639
00:55:04,801 --> 00:55:05,635
Uh...

640
00:55:05,719 --> 00:55:07,762
You thought I forgot about that,
didn't you?

641
00:55:08,805 --> 00:55:09,723
I was...

642
00:55:09,806 --> 00:55:13,476
I was... I just... I was...

643
00:55:19,274 --> 00:55:21,109
Uh... Oh my God.

644
00:55:21,693 --> 00:55:23,611
I'm so sorry. I'm so stupid.

645
00:55:23,695 --> 00:55:26,239
Yes, you are.
I've only been saying that for years.

646
00:55:26,323 --> 00:55:27,866
Now you get it.

647
00:55:27,949 --> 00:55:29,409
Where was I?

648
00:55:29,492 --> 00:55:31,411
You were about to tell me
to start reading.

649
00:55:31,494 --> 00:55:34,497
Oh yes.
Well then, what are you waiting for?

650
00:55:34,581 --> 00:55:35,581
Get on with it.

651
00:55:41,671 --> 00:55:44,299
"For generations,
the evil sorcerer of Quantel

652
00:55:44,382 --> 00:55:48,136
sent children to mine jewels
from the mouth of the great monster."

653
00:55:54,351 --> 00:55:55,685
"A thousand years ago,

654
00:55:55,769 --> 00:55:58,646
the evil sorcerer had a chance
to kill the odious beast,

655
00:55:58,730 --> 00:56:03,234
but instead he used a powerful potion
to keep the monster unconscious,

656
00:56:03,318 --> 00:56:05,070
to make himself rich."

657
00:56:05,153 --> 00:56:08,198
"Odious." Good word.

658
00:56:10,408 --> 00:56:12,911
"Every morning,
the sorcerer funneled his potion

659
00:56:12,994 --> 00:56:15,288
down the monster's fifth ear,

660
00:56:15,372 --> 00:56:17,582
and the beast remained unconscious."

661
00:56:17,665 --> 00:56:19,876
"The recipe was as old as time."

662
00:56:19,959 --> 00:56:23,129
"Dissolved rat's bones,
dry-aged widow orchid,

663
00:56:23,213 --> 00:56:25,215
powdered beetle shells."

664
00:56:25,298 --> 00:56:29,344
"But the most important ingredient,
however, was bindweed."

665
00:56:29,928 --> 00:56:31,346
"Bindweed was the only thing

666
00:56:31,429 --> 00:56:33,973
that could hide
the powerful stench of the potion."

667
00:56:34,057 --> 00:56:37,852
"Without it, the rancid smell
would rouse the great monster."

668
00:56:37,936 --> 00:56:41,314
"But one day, the sorcerer
went to harvest more bindweed,

669
00:56:41,398 --> 00:56:45,235
and he discovered that the entire field
had withered and died."

670
00:56:45,735 --> 00:56:48,113
"The potion smelled worse than ever."

671
00:56:48,196 --> 00:56:51,366
"Putrid, rank, malodorous..."

672
00:56:51,449 --> 00:56:54,244
Oh, yes, yes, yes. Understood. It stinks.

673
00:56:54,327 --> 00:56:59,457
"The sorcerer would have to kill
the great monster once and for all."

674
00:56:59,541 --> 00:57:03,336
"He reluctantly raised his mighty staff
to kill the beast,

675
00:57:03,420 --> 00:57:07,048
but a peasant girl came to him
and promised a solution to his problem."

676
00:57:07,132 --> 00:57:10,677
I know a replacement for bindweed.
Your jewel harvest can continue.

677
00:57:10,760 --> 00:57:13,555
Foolish child.
You know nothing of real magic.

678
00:57:13,638 --> 00:57:17,016
I can prove it.
And if I do, I want a bag of jewels.

679
00:57:17,517 --> 00:57:20,270
If it works, you will get two bags.

680
00:57:20,353 --> 00:57:23,606
If not, you will give me your life.

681
00:57:24,691 --> 00:57:26,526
"The peasant girl stepped forward

682
00:57:26,609 --> 00:57:29,821
and poured a mysterious dark liquid
into the jug."

683
00:57:31,364 --> 00:57:33,575
"The evil sorcerer sniffed the potion."

684
00:57:33,658 --> 00:57:36,703
"The smell disappeared.
The sorcerer couldn't believe it."

685
00:57:37,287 --> 00:57:40,874
"It smelled like daisies,
roses, lilacs on a spring morning..."

686
00:57:44,544 --> 00:57:46,504
"The evil sorcerer
poured the potion

687
00:57:46,588 --> 00:57:48,965
into the monster's ear and waited."

688
00:57:49,048 --> 00:57:52,051
- "- The beast let out a long...
- ...grumble

689
00:57:52,135 --> 00:57:53,928
then went still again."

690
00:57:54,012 --> 00:57:59,058
"Yes! But the peasant girl had removed
more than just the smell from the potion."

691
00:57:59,684 --> 00:58:02,312
"She'd also erased all of its magic."

692
00:58:02,896 --> 00:58:05,648
"The sorcerer's potion
was rendered useless."

693
00:58:06,316 --> 00:58:08,860
"The peasant girl nodded
to something behind him."

694
00:58:10,820 --> 00:58:13,823
"The eyes
of the great monster were open."

695
00:58:13,907 --> 00:58:15,658
"The sorcerer shrieked."

696
00:58:15,742 --> 00:58:18,703
"The peasant girl
watched it all, smiling."

697
00:58:18,786 --> 00:58:22,665
"The evil sorcerer had sent
her baby brother into that cave,

698
00:58:22,749 --> 00:58:24,334
and he never returned."

699
00:58:24,834 --> 00:58:26,878
"The peasant girl
cared nothing about jewels."

700
00:58:26,961 --> 00:58:28,880
"She got what she wanted, revenge."

701
00:58:28,963 --> 00:58:30,381
"And so she walked away

702
00:58:30,465 --> 00:58:34,385
as the monster's sharp teeth
chomped down on the shrieking sorcerer,

703
00:58:34,469 --> 00:58:36,971
silencing him forever."

704
00:58:39,015 --> 00:58:42,352
"Just as the peasant girl
thought she'd gotten away with it all,

705
00:58:42,435 --> 00:58:44,229
a black shadow loomed over her."

706
00:58:44,312 --> 00:58:47,440
"It was the monster's giant foot,
right above her."

707
00:58:47,524 --> 00:58:48,816
"Splat."

708
00:58:48,900 --> 00:58:49,900
"The end."

709
00:58:50,360 --> 00:58:51,694
"And not a happy one."

710
00:58:54,155 --> 00:58:55,155
Bindweed?

711
00:58:55,865 --> 00:58:58,409
Yeah, me and Yasmin researched for hours.

712
00:58:58,493 --> 00:59:01,079
I know how important it is
to get all the details right...

713
00:59:01,162 --> 00:59:03,581
- No.
- No?

714
00:59:05,875 --> 00:59:06,709
No.

715
00:59:08,962 --> 00:59:09,796
I...

716
00:59:09,879 --> 00:59:12,090
Of course I made up
the potion's ingredients,

717
00:59:12,173 --> 00:59:16,386
but I was sure that bindweed hides odors.

718
00:59:17,804 --> 00:59:21,391
- I really thought we got it right.
- Well, there's your mistake.

719
00:59:21,474 --> 00:59:22,684
You worked with her.

720
00:59:23,643 --> 00:59:27,355
Bindweed keeps liquid from separating.

721
00:59:29,440 --> 00:59:32,902
Everyone knows cinaroot hides smells,

722
00:59:32,986 --> 00:59:34,988
not bindweed.

723
00:59:38,074 --> 00:59:40,827
Cinaroot, of course.

724
00:59:44,080 --> 00:59:46,958
Is that cinaroot with an "S" or a "C"?

725
01:00:03,808 --> 01:00:07,270
♪ The last fire will rise ♪

726
01:00:07,353 --> 01:00:10,565
♪ Behind those eyes ♪

727
01:00:10,648 --> 01:00:13,651
♪ Black house will rock ♪

728
01:00:13,735 --> 01:00:18,906
♪ Blind boys don't lie... ♪

729
01:00:18,990 --> 01:00:19,990
Okay.

730
01:00:20,742 --> 01:00:22,410
Let's do some science stuff.

731
01:00:37,508 --> 01:00:39,302
Tonight, we're getting out of here.

732
01:01:16,756 --> 01:01:18,174
Good night, Natacha.

733
01:01:23,262 --> 01:01:25,223
Oh my God. What's happening?

734
01:01:25,807 --> 01:01:28,643
It's turning green.
I can't bring this out there.

735
01:01:35,358 --> 01:01:36,818
Some kind of reaction?

736
01:01:38,653 --> 01:01:40,405
Maybe the acidity of the lemonade...

737
01:01:40,488 --> 01:01:44,242
The service here is terrible.

738
01:01:44,325 --> 01:01:45,326
I don't have a story.

739
01:01:45,410 --> 01:01:46,786
We put two drops in the glass.

740
01:01:46,869 --> 01:01:49,414
- Let's put two in the pitcher.
- Will it put her to sleep?

741
01:02:20,570 --> 01:02:21,571
Hmm.

742
01:02:35,168 --> 01:02:36,669
Where is my lemonade?

743
01:02:37,628 --> 01:02:38,628
It's coming!

744
01:02:40,381 --> 01:02:42,800
What? I put it right here.

745
01:02:45,470 --> 01:02:47,346
- Where is it?
- What are you talking about?

746
01:02:47,430 --> 01:02:49,807
Where is the potion? This has to happen.

747
01:02:54,729 --> 01:02:55,729
She knows.

748
01:03:11,704 --> 01:03:12,704
Uh...

749
01:03:14,248 --> 01:03:15,249
So, uh...

750
01:03:19,879 --> 01:03:21,464
So it's...

751
01:03:23,883 --> 01:03:24,883
It's gotta...

752
01:03:28,137 --> 01:03:29,137
It's...

753
01:03:31,641 --> 01:03:32,558
Hmm.

754
01:03:35,394 --> 01:03:36,394
Let's see.

755
01:03:37,063 --> 01:03:38,356
So, um...

756
01:03:43,277 --> 01:03:45,738
Any day now, Storyteller.

757
01:03:46,239 --> 01:03:49,659
Yeah, yeah. It's, uh... it's here somewhere.

758
01:03:53,788 --> 01:03:55,414
Spit it out.

759
01:03:55,498 --> 01:03:56,791
Oh, okay.

760
01:04:02,421 --> 01:04:04,423
- I just gotta find it.
- Read!

761
01:04:07,260 --> 01:04:08,719
Here it is.

762
01:04:09,929 --> 01:04:10,929
Hmm.

763
01:04:11,514 --> 01:04:13,349
Uh...

764
01:04:14,267 --> 01:04:19,605
So, um, this one is, um,
called "The Cuckoo Clock."

765
01:04:26,737 --> 01:04:30,783
When Scott's parents
bought the cuckoo clock at an estate sale,

766
01:04:30,867 --> 01:04:35,329
he thought it was just
another old-timey piece of junk.

767
01:04:35,913 --> 01:04:40,084
But there was something strange
about the clock.

768
01:04:40,167 --> 01:04:42,420
Every hour on the hour,

769
01:04:42,503 --> 01:04:44,547
the little cuckoo would pop out,

770
01:04:44,630 --> 01:04:48,551
and, uh, Steve started to notice...

771
01:04:48,634 --> 01:04:50,595
Who's Steve?

772
01:04:50,678 --> 01:04:53,014
I thought you said his name was Scott.

773
01:04:53,097 --> 01:04:55,892
Sorry. Right. Uh, typo.

774
01:04:55,975 --> 01:04:59,103
So... so Scott noticed that, uh, the cuckoo

775
01:04:59,186 --> 01:05:02,356
seemed to look a little bit different
every time it appeared.

776
01:05:02,440 --> 01:05:04,108
Like, its eyes would...

777
01:05:05,526 --> 01:05:07,653
- What is this?
- Uh...

778
01:05:09,280 --> 01:05:11,032
Where are all your stories,

779
01:05:11,115 --> 01:05:14,243
the ones that you're supposed
to be writing every day?

780
01:05:14,785 --> 01:05:17,371
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
- Where are your new stories?

781
01:05:17,455 --> 01:05:19,790
The Shredder, it got into my backpack.

782
01:05:20,917 --> 01:05:24,045
The Shredder ate your homework?

783
01:05:24,128 --> 01:05:27,798
Uh, it's true.
It escaped from the night nursery.

784
01:05:27,882 --> 01:05:30,343
Quiet, girl.

785
01:05:30,426 --> 01:05:32,511
Thorns in my side...

786
01:05:32,595 --> 01:05:35,473
- No!
- ...since the moment you arrived.

787
01:05:35,556 --> 01:05:37,183
I'll make you the recipe. I...

788
01:05:37,266 --> 01:05:41,812
Please. You can barely follow a recipe.

789
01:05:41,896 --> 01:05:43,356
He writes for you! You need him!

790
01:05:43,439 --> 01:05:46,025
I'll write the best story for you!

791
01:05:46,567 --> 01:05:48,152
Hmm, let's face it.

792
01:05:49,737 --> 01:05:51,781
This is long overdue.

793
01:05:51,864 --> 01:05:53,783
Please, no! No!

794
01:06:22,144 --> 01:06:23,144
What?

795
01:06:25,356 --> 01:06:27,066
Don't touch her. Don't touch.

796
01:06:43,624 --> 01:06:45,418
Lenore.

797
01:06:45,501 --> 01:06:46,752
You okay?

798
01:06:47,336 --> 01:06:48,796
What's... what's happening?

799
01:06:50,923 --> 01:06:53,050
Oh no. What's wrong with you?

800
01:06:54,343 --> 01:06:55,803
Something's wrong.

801
01:06:57,013 --> 01:06:59,181
Poor little thing. What happened to you?

802
01:06:59,265 --> 01:07:01,308
Lenore put our potion
in the bottle of mist.

803
01:07:01,892 --> 01:07:03,894
I can't believe it.

804
01:07:08,315 --> 01:07:10,818
She must've gotten a dose
of the sleeping potion.

805
01:07:13,446 --> 01:07:14,655
She's a prisoner,

806
01:07:15,406 --> 01:07:16,407
just like us.

807
01:07:18,367 --> 01:07:21,245
- Thank you, Lenore.
- Alex, we did it.

808
01:07:21,746 --> 01:07:23,372
We beat her.

809
01:07:30,129 --> 01:07:32,006
How's that for following a recipe?

810
01:07:42,016 --> 01:07:43,893
Wait. Where do you think it goes?

811
01:07:45,436 --> 01:07:46,436
Home.

812
01:08:17,635 --> 01:08:19,553
Never thought I'd see trees again.

813
01:08:24,183 --> 01:08:25,183
Look.

814
01:08:32,191 --> 01:08:34,318
I'm never gonna eat
peanut butter ever again!

815
01:08:34,401 --> 01:08:36,487
You can forget
about pumpkin pie for me!

816
01:08:36,570 --> 01:08:39,532
First food when I get back?
Vanilla milkshake!

817
01:08:42,201 --> 01:08:45,955
Whoa, whoa, wait, Alex.
Hold up. Hold up. Just wait a second.

818
01:08:51,335 --> 01:08:52,545
That's widow's grub.

819
01:08:53,129 --> 01:08:54,713
That's sunken lily.

820
01:08:56,006 --> 01:08:57,007
Why is that here?

821
01:09:11,063 --> 01:09:12,606
No, no, no. Alex! Alex!

822
01:09:13,274 --> 01:09:15,151
Alex! Alex!

823
01:09:15,985 --> 01:09:18,696
The door, it wasn't the way out.

824
01:09:20,156 --> 01:09:21,866
We're still in the apartment.

825
01:09:50,019 --> 01:09:53,480
Evil unicorn!

826
01:09:53,981 --> 01:09:54,981
Run!

827
01:10:00,362 --> 01:10:01,447
Run!

828
01:10:01,530 --> 01:10:03,365
Alex, it's getting closer!

829
01:10:03,449 --> 01:10:05,618
It's too fast!

830
01:10:12,917 --> 01:10:14,168
Oh my God.

831
01:10:20,049 --> 01:10:23,052
- What just happened?
- Maybe something spooked it?

832
01:10:36,398 --> 01:10:37,398
Alex?

833
01:10:59,505 --> 01:11:02,216
"Every good story hints at truth."

834
01:11:05,177 --> 01:11:06,178
Oh my God.

835
01:11:06,762 --> 01:11:10,391
"Hansel and Gretel" was real.

836
01:11:12,393 --> 01:11:13,269
Yas?

837
01:11:13,352 --> 01:11:15,354
We're in "Hansel..."

838
01:11:15,437 --> 01:11:17,773
It smells so delicious.

839
01:11:24,154 --> 01:11:25,698
Yas?

840
01:11:26,740 --> 01:11:29,118
So hungry.

841
01:11:35,749 --> 01:11:36,875
Yas!

842
01:12:07,906 --> 01:12:09,867
We... we shouldn't be in here, Yas.

843
01:12:18,584 --> 01:12:19,584
Yas?

844
01:12:22,129 --> 01:12:23,129
Hello?

845
01:12:27,634 --> 01:12:29,762
Yas, what's wrong with you?

846
01:12:32,222 --> 01:12:33,222
Yas?

847
01:13:21,063 --> 01:13:22,063
Yas?

848
01:13:24,691 --> 01:13:25,776
Lenore?

849
01:13:33,867 --> 01:13:34,867
Yasmin?

850
01:13:44,002 --> 01:13:45,002
Hello?

851
01:13:47,089 --> 01:13:48,173
Yasmin!

852
01:13:54,096 --> 01:13:55,389
Yasmin!

853
01:14:02,396 --> 01:14:03,396
I'm... I'm okay.

854
01:14:03,981 --> 01:14:05,315
This is probably fine.

855
01:14:40,809 --> 01:14:42,311
Well, well, well!

856
01:14:42,394 --> 01:14:44,438
Sleeping Beauty awakes.

857
01:14:45,772 --> 01:14:48,233
Oh, wait. Wrong story.

858
01:14:52,112 --> 01:14:54,698
Alex!

859
01:14:54,781 --> 01:14:56,867
- Are you guys okay?
- Yeah.

860
01:14:57,951 --> 01:14:59,036
We're okay.

861
01:15:22,226 --> 01:15:25,187
The mist, that's where it comes from.

862
01:15:25,896 --> 01:15:27,272
You're harvesting it.

863
01:15:27,898 --> 01:15:29,983
Who's inside that coffin?

864
01:15:32,319 --> 01:15:33,862
The original witch,

865
01:15:35,531 --> 01:15:39,660
who, by the way, does eat children.

866
01:15:40,827 --> 01:15:44,665
We thought you were the original witch.
We thought the blue mist kept you young.

867
01:15:44,748 --> 01:15:47,876
I don't need the mist to keep me young.

868
01:15:47,960 --> 01:15:49,545
It gives me her magic.

869
01:15:49,628 --> 01:15:50,628
What?

870
01:15:51,046 --> 01:15:52,130
How?

871
01:15:52,631 --> 01:15:55,467
I was about your age when she got me.

872
01:15:55,968 --> 01:15:58,095
There were lots of us back then.

873
01:15:59,096 --> 01:16:01,223
But we weren't dumb.

874
01:16:02,015 --> 01:16:04,309
We knew not to get attached,

875
01:16:04,393 --> 01:16:07,604
because she got hungry.

876
01:16:08,105 --> 01:16:09,273
She ate them?

877
01:16:12,025 --> 01:16:13,151
Yes.

878
01:16:15,946 --> 01:16:17,114
All of them.

879
01:16:22,536 --> 01:16:26,248
And then I...
I had to clean the oven.

880
01:16:27,874 --> 01:16:29,960
I pretended to like her.

881
01:16:30,544 --> 01:16:33,130
Pretended to want to be like her.

882
01:16:33,213 --> 01:16:35,007
I became her favorite.

883
01:16:35,924 --> 01:16:39,928
But when I was alone, I plotted my escape.

884
01:16:42,889 --> 01:16:45,017
I would get her to trust me.

885
01:16:47,519 --> 01:16:50,147
And then, a sleeping potion,

886
01:16:51,106 --> 01:16:52,482
and I would be free.

887
01:16:53,483 --> 01:16:55,402
I ran straight home...

888
01:17:04,369 --> 01:17:06,038
but my parents were gone.

889
01:17:07,414 --> 01:17:08,540
They left you.

890
01:17:09,708 --> 01:17:11,585
I had nowhere else to go,

891
01:17:11,668 --> 01:17:13,879
so I came back here.

892
01:17:18,759 --> 01:17:20,385
Who cares about them?

893
01:17:24,056 --> 01:17:25,474
You were just like us.

894
01:17:27,976 --> 01:17:28,976
Wait.

895
01:17:29,811 --> 01:17:31,021
The sleeping potion...

896
01:17:32,773 --> 01:17:34,358
You're Unicorn Girl.

897
01:17:39,363 --> 01:17:40,363
Ah.

898
01:17:41,948 --> 01:17:44,076
You read my diaries.

899
01:17:48,205 --> 01:17:49,581
Did you meet my pet?

900
01:17:50,082 --> 01:17:51,541
The unicorn?

901
01:17:53,126 --> 01:17:54,127
That's your pet?

902
01:17:54,753 --> 01:17:55,754
I made him.

903
01:17:56,880 --> 01:17:58,632
I make many things now.

904
01:18:08,141 --> 01:18:10,644
She's the one
who's been shaking the apartment?

905
01:18:10,727 --> 01:18:15,440
If she doesn't get a story,
we're all gonna die.

906
01:18:16,149 --> 01:18:18,902
Stories keep her asleep.

907
01:18:18,985 --> 01:18:24,533
Stories of fear and suffering and death
are like sweet lullabies to her.

908
01:18:24,616 --> 01:18:26,034
Tell one.

909
01:18:26,118 --> 01:18:27,244
I don't have a story.

910
01:18:27,327 --> 01:18:28,537
Oh, yes, you do.

911
01:18:28,620 --> 01:18:32,040
Tell us the reason that you wanted
to destroy your Nightbooks.

912
01:18:33,750 --> 01:18:37,003
But... that's not scary...

913
01:18:37,087 --> 01:18:38,755
It was, to you.

914
01:18:39,339 --> 01:18:44,636
All that pain and fear and sadness

915
01:18:44,720 --> 01:18:47,889
that you've been avoiding this whole time.

916
01:18:47,973 --> 01:18:48,890
Tell it!

917
01:18:55,522 --> 01:18:56,565
Now, Alex!

918
01:18:56,648 --> 01:18:58,316
You think I'm a bad witch?

919
01:18:59,067 --> 01:19:01,653
Just wait until she wakes up and sees you.

920
01:19:02,237 --> 01:19:04,948
So young, so plump, so juicy...

921
01:19:05,031 --> 01:19:06,366
Okay! Okay!

922
01:19:13,415 --> 01:19:17,461
There once was a boy
who... who loved to write scary stories.

923
01:19:17,544 --> 01:19:19,463
Every day, on his free time,

924
01:19:19,546 --> 01:19:22,883
he would come up with new ways
to scare his classmates.

925
01:19:33,852 --> 01:19:35,604
But...

926
01:19:35,687 --> 01:19:39,065
...they just didn't get
his fascination with creepy things.

927
01:19:39,149 --> 01:19:43,195
To them, he was just... weird.

928
01:19:44,029 --> 01:19:46,239
"What's wrong with you?" they'd ask.

929
01:19:46,740 --> 01:19:48,158
Many of them were cruel,

930
01:19:48,950 --> 01:19:52,329
calling him names, like Creepshow.

931
01:19:54,331 --> 01:19:55,499
Except for Joshua.

932
01:19:56,500 --> 01:19:57,918
Josh was his best friend

933
01:19:59,377 --> 01:20:00,504
since kindergarten.

934
01:20:02,005 --> 01:20:04,925
Alex finishes
his latest bone-chilling tale,

935
01:20:05,008 --> 01:20:06,426
and he's excited to share it.

936
01:20:08,011 --> 01:20:09,930
Hey, you're gonna love this one.

937
01:20:10,430 --> 01:20:11,430
Josh?

938
01:20:12,557 --> 01:20:14,518
Hey, Josh?

939
01:20:18,146 --> 01:20:20,524
Alex catches up with Josh
after class.

940
01:20:21,399 --> 01:20:23,401
Wait. My birthday's tonight.

941
01:20:23,485 --> 01:20:25,737
We turned the apartment
into a haunted house.

942
01:20:25,821 --> 01:20:28,657
It's amazing.
I've got tons of new stories ready.

943
01:20:29,616 --> 01:20:30,992
Josh talks low,

944
01:20:31,076 --> 01:20:33,161
not wanting the others to hear.

945
01:20:33,245 --> 01:20:35,247
Cody's having a gaming party.

946
01:20:35,330 --> 01:20:37,415
His dad's getting the truck
and everything.

947
01:20:38,166 --> 01:20:41,127
But to... tonight's my party.

948
01:20:41,628 --> 01:20:44,923
...says Alex, confused and hurt.

949
01:20:45,590 --> 01:20:48,426
Alex's hope sinks. He's desperate.

950
01:20:48,510 --> 01:20:49,510
He says...

951
01:20:51,263 --> 01:20:53,181
You're my best friend.

952
01:20:54,057 --> 01:20:55,892
Josh tries to be gentle.

953
01:20:56,476 --> 01:20:57,477
Yeah, right.

954
01:20:57,978 --> 01:20:59,563
Cody's my friend now too.

955
01:20:59,646 --> 01:21:01,231
And you're just not...

956
01:21:02,524 --> 01:21:03,567
Come on.

957
01:21:04,067 --> 01:21:07,279
The way you dress, the things you like.

958
01:21:07,362 --> 01:21:10,031
"All you do
is talk about your scary stories."

959
01:21:11,950 --> 01:21:13,410
Everyone thinks it's weird.

960
01:21:13,994 --> 01:21:16,621
That's when Cody butts in.

961
01:21:16,705 --> 01:21:18,456
Yo, Josh, you comin'?

962
01:21:18,540 --> 01:21:19,624
Come on, J-Man.

963
01:21:20,208 --> 01:21:23,420
All right, all right.
Alex, I'll see you later, okay?

964
01:21:28,800 --> 01:21:32,470
The boy had written a new story
about a haunted house.

965
01:21:33,722 --> 01:21:35,974
He, his mom, and his dad

966
01:21:36,683 --> 01:21:39,311
had turned his whole apartment
into that house.

967
01:21:42,397 --> 01:21:43,773
No one showed up...

968
01:21:46,067 --> 01:21:47,569
not even Josh.

969
01:21:55,493 --> 01:22:00,624
They made him hate
the thing he loved most.

970
01:22:02,584 --> 01:22:05,003
And they made him hate himself.

971
01:22:10,717 --> 01:22:16,097
The real truth is,
he was embarrassed to be himself,

972
01:22:17,307 --> 01:22:19,726
so he decided to burn his Nightbooks.

973
01:22:20,894 --> 01:22:24,022
He swore he'd never write
another story again.

974
01:22:25,565 --> 01:22:26,565
He could be

975
01:22:27,859 --> 01:22:28,902
a new person.

976
01:22:29,819 --> 01:22:31,905
Not weird.

977
01:22:32,405 --> 01:22:33,865
Not a freak.

978
01:22:34,366 --> 01:22:35,992
He could be normal,

979
01:22:36,785 --> 01:22:39,788
like Josh and his friends.

980
01:22:42,624 --> 01:22:44,334
Then he wouldn't be alone.

981
01:22:56,221 --> 01:22:59,140
The boy lost all his friends,

982
01:22:59,224 --> 01:23:01,810
so he decided to destroy
that part of himself

983
01:23:01,893 --> 01:23:03,853
that created the Nightbooks.

984
01:23:03,937 --> 01:23:05,814
Then a witch captured him.

985
01:23:06,564 --> 01:23:08,692
She said she liked his stories.

986
01:23:11,736 --> 01:23:13,321
The witch was lying.

987
01:23:13,947 --> 01:23:15,323
But being captured by her

988
01:23:15,407 --> 01:23:17,617
was the best thing
that ever happened to me...

989
01:23:19,953 --> 01:23:21,413
...because I made new friends,

990
01:23:23,289 --> 01:23:27,293
friends who love me for who I am,
not for who they want me to be.

991
01:23:27,377 --> 01:23:29,212
What have you done? No!

992
01:23:30,046 --> 01:23:30,880
No!

993
01:23:33,174 --> 01:23:34,926
No.

994
01:23:35,010 --> 01:23:37,429
- No!
- This is our happy ending!

995
01:23:37,512 --> 01:23:39,264
No happy endings.

996
01:23:44,144 --> 01:23:46,938
- Guys, let's get out of here.
- Fine.

997
01:23:47,022 --> 01:23:48,148
No!

998
01:23:48,231 --> 01:23:51,401
Oh! No! No, you idiot!

999
01:23:51,484 --> 01:23:54,779
What have you done? You stupid children.

1000
01:23:54,863 --> 01:23:56,656
No! No!

1001
01:24:20,055 --> 01:24:23,933
Oh God! Oh God!

1002
01:24:31,483 --> 01:24:32,901
Oh God.

1003
01:25:10,772 --> 01:25:11,772
You're awake.

1004
01:25:12,565 --> 01:25:13,565
Finally.

1005
01:25:14,109 --> 01:25:18,238
You've been asleep here so long,
the... the candy is infecting you.

1006
01:25:19,531 --> 01:25:20,865
You...

1007
01:25:23,368 --> 01:25:25,245
You did this to me.

1008
01:25:25,328 --> 01:25:30,708
I have lived in fear of you for so long,
but I am not that little girl anymore.

1009
01:25:34,838 --> 01:25:36,381
Witch fight!

1010
01:25:36,464 --> 01:25:37,966
- Let's get out of here!
- Let's go!

1011
01:25:41,136 --> 01:25:42,470
Go! Just go!

1012
01:25:42,554 --> 01:25:44,931
Go! Go!

1013
01:26:15,003 --> 01:26:18,715
Help! We need help! Get us out of here!

1014
01:26:18,798 --> 01:26:21,009
A witch is gonna eat us!

1015
01:26:21,092 --> 01:26:22,135
Help!

1016
01:26:22,635 --> 01:26:24,429
Can anyone hear me?

1017
01:26:24,512 --> 01:26:27,807
Alex, move.
I've seen Natacha do this.

1018
01:26:34,314 --> 01:26:35,314
Yas?

1019
01:26:39,027 --> 01:26:40,027
Yasmin?

1020
01:26:45,617 --> 01:26:46,617
Whoa!

1021
01:26:47,744 --> 01:26:48,744
You... you did it.

1022
01:26:49,370 --> 01:26:50,371
You did it.

1023
01:26:54,751 --> 01:26:58,046
- I'm home.
- Let's go.

1024
01:27:01,049 --> 01:27:02,425
- Lenore!
- We gotta go.

1025
01:27:04,177 --> 01:27:06,596
We're still in my building.
The apartment didn't move.

1026
01:27:09,432 --> 01:27:12,477
- Do you have a plan?
- Not exactly a plan, an idea.

1027
01:27:18,024 --> 01:27:19,567
Hello, children.

1028
01:27:22,362 --> 01:27:25,240
I'm so hungry.

1029
01:27:43,758 --> 01:27:46,261
This is the worst elevator ever!

1030
01:28:03,319 --> 01:28:04,319
What now?

1031
01:28:04,779 --> 01:28:07,323
We just need to make it
to that boiler room.

1032
01:28:21,838 --> 01:28:23,256
You gotta be kidding me.

1033
01:28:48,906 --> 01:28:51,743
- No! No! No! No!
- No! No! No! No!

1034
01:29:10,053 --> 01:29:13,097
No! Oh my God!

1035
01:29:19,896 --> 01:29:22,607
No, let... let her go. It's me you want.

1036
01:29:22,690 --> 01:29:25,443
Incorrect.

1037
01:29:25,526 --> 01:29:27,612
I want both of you.

1038
01:29:27,695 --> 01:29:28,695
No!

1039
01:29:28,738 --> 01:29:30,823
No. I'm sorry.

1040
01:29:30,907 --> 01:29:33,159
No!

1041
01:29:41,834 --> 01:29:43,378
Lenore!

1042
01:29:45,713 --> 01:29:47,715
No. No.

1043
01:29:48,299 --> 01:29:51,469
"Stories about fear and death
are like lullabies to her."

1044
01:29:51,552 --> 01:29:52,804
No, no, no.

1045
01:29:53,554 --> 01:29:54,554
No!

1046
01:29:56,766 --> 01:29:57,766
No!

1047
01:30:00,311 --> 01:30:01,729
She's read all of them.

1048
01:30:01,813 --> 01:30:03,648
No!

1049
01:30:03,731 --> 01:30:05,233
Hey, ugly.

1050
01:30:06,567 --> 01:30:09,362
You like stories? I got stories.

1051
01:30:15,576 --> 01:30:19,580
Jason couldn't decide which was stranger.

1052
01:30:19,664 --> 01:30:23,543
The fact that his sister died
every Tuesday at 11:15

1053
01:30:23,626 --> 01:30:26,129
or that she always
came back to life 20 minutes later.

1054
01:30:26,212 --> 01:30:28,339
More. Give me more.

1055
01:30:31,509 --> 01:30:35,805
Zachary had always thought that clowns
were the scariest part of the circus.

1056
01:30:35,888 --> 01:30:37,223
He was wrong.

1057
01:30:39,392 --> 01:30:41,227
I found a package on my front porch

1058
01:30:41,811 --> 01:30:46,482
addressed to the woman
standing right behind you.

1059
01:30:47,233 --> 01:30:49,235
Who? Who was it?

1060
01:30:49,318 --> 01:30:50,778
Who was it?

1061
01:30:57,160 --> 01:31:00,621
- The stories!
- Push her! Push her in!

1062
01:31:04,292 --> 01:31:06,127
Keep pushing!

1063
01:31:12,717 --> 01:31:14,469
Don't let her out!

1064
01:31:15,553 --> 01:31:17,722
Keep it shut! Keep pushing!

1065
01:31:19,640 --> 01:31:21,476
- Keep it shut!
- Keep her in!

1066
01:31:26,564 --> 01:31:28,608
Oh my God.

1067
01:31:32,195 --> 01:31:34,197
So that's why they call you a tryhard?

1068
01:31:34,280 --> 01:31:35,990
Shut up, Creepshow.

1069
01:31:40,077 --> 01:31:41,287
All right, skin-bag.

1070
01:31:41,871 --> 01:31:44,373
We didn't forget about you. Come here.

1071
01:31:54,509 --> 01:31:55,510
Let's go home.

1072
01:32:00,348 --> 01:32:02,266
Maybe we should take the stairs.

1073
01:32:02,350 --> 01:32:05,478
♪ ...behind those eyes ♪
