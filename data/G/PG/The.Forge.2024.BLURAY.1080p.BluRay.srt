it's time for you to step up.

If you don't want to
go to college, that's fine,

'cause let me tell you
what you're not gonna do.

56
00:03:14,986 --> 00:03:16,987
You're not gonna sit around here

He was gonna fix it up

he was gonna fix it up with me.

175
00:10:16,866 --> 00:10:19,869
I don't know. I'm just
taking it a day at a time.

176
00:10:21,370 --> 00:10:22,580
Well, Isaiah...

177
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:25,707
if you're available to work,

178
00:10:25,708 --> 00:10:28,377
we can discuss options
in my company.

179
00:10:29,879 --> 00:10:32,089
But I want to ask you
a few questions first.

180
00:10:33,132 --> 00:10:37,303
Now, if you wanna take some time
to think about your answers,

181
00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:40,890
we can get together and talk
again when you're ready.

182
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:45,978
My questions are these.

183
00:10:46,854 --> 00:10:50,191
In what ways do you want to grow
in the next year?

184
00:10:51,484 --> 00:10:53,694
What kind of man
do you want to be?

185
00:10:54,695 --> 00:10:56,780
And what do you want
people to think

186
00:10:56,781 --> 00:10:58,366
when they see you coming?

187
00:11:01,952 --> 00:11:03,119
I'll tell you what I think.

188
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:04,788
You either help at home
to the degree

189
00:11:04,789 --> 00:11:06,623
you adding value like a job,

190
00:11:06,624 --> 00:11:07,999
or you get a job

191
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,377
that funds the value
of your home to the degree

192
00:11:10,378 --> 00:11:12,420
it equals the work at home
you would have done.

193
00:11:12,421 --> 00:11:14,047
- Yes, ma'am.
- CYNTHIA: Girl, what?

194
00:11:14,048 --> 00:11:16,049
You lost me. You're gonna
have to say that again.

195
00:11:16,050 --> 00:11:17,133
KEISHA: Cynthia.

196
00:11:17,134 --> 00:11:18,218
Honey, I agree.

197
00:11:18,219 --> 00:11:20,553
You need to draw a line
in the sand.

198
00:11:20,554 --> 00:11:24,015
Well, I'm just trying
to figure out how to balance

199
00:11:24,016 --> 00:11:26,142
helping him know
I understand him,

200
00:11:26,143 --> 00:11:29,270
but still pushing him
to become an adult.

201
00:11:29,271 --> 00:11:30,647
And that is not easy.

202
00:11:30,648 --> 00:11:32,023
You're on the right track, girl.

203
00:11:32,024 --> 00:11:33,525
He's got to step up
and step out,

204
00:11:33,526 --> 00:11:34,609
'cause you can step in

205
00:11:34,610 --> 00:11:36,069
and speak up about him
not stepping up,

206
00:11:36,070 --> 00:11:38,571
but you don't want to overstep
the main step of loving him.

207
00:11:38,572 --> 00:11:41,741
Yes, ma'am. That's exactly
what I was thinking, girl.

208
00:11:41,742 --> 00:11:44,702
Okay. You two must be
at a higher level,

209
00:11:44,703 --> 00:11:45,787
but I'mma catch up.

210
00:11:45,788 --> 00:11:47,790
Oh. Here he comes now.

211
00:11:48,457 --> 00:11:50,667
- WOMAN: Hey, Isaiah.
- Hey.

212
00:11:50,668 --> 00:11:52,085
Isaiah, you walk here?

213
00:11:52,086 --> 00:11:54,171
Oh, it's just one mile
from the house.

214
00:11:54,839 --> 00:11:56,548
But, um, I need to use your car.

215
00:11:56,549 --> 00:11:58,925
I found a couple places online
that are hiring, so...

216
00:11:58,926 --> 00:12:01,636
Well, okay, but I need you
back here by 5:00.

217
00:12:01,637 --> 00:12:04,222
I'm picking up a case of product
from Maxwell's at 5:15,

218
00:12:04,223 --> 00:12:05,974
and they're staying open late
for me.

219
00:12:05,975 --> 00:12:07,977
- So, you can't be late.
- I won't.

220
00:12:09,311 --> 00:12:11,646
Isaiah. Five o'clock.

221
00:12:11,647 --> 00:12:12,814
I'll be here.

222
00:12:12,815 --> 00:12:15,191
- I'm not playing with you.
- ISAIAH: Yes, ma'am.

223
00:12:15,192 --> 00:12:17,069
- Bye, Isaiah.
- ISAIAH: Bye, y'all.

224
00:12:17,736 --> 00:12:18,778
Cute boy.

225
00:12:18,779 --> 00:12:20,488
He sure favors his daddy.

226
00:12:20,489 --> 00:12:22,073
KEISHA: Hmm, he do.

227
00:12:22,074 --> 00:12:24,826
Oh, ain't he working
as a truck driver now?

228
00:12:24,827 --> 00:12:26,453
Girl, I don't know
what Darren is doing.

229
00:12:26,454 --> 00:12:27,912
I don't wanna talk
about no Darren.

230
00:12:27,913 --> 00:12:30,123
LAUGHS

231
00:12:30,124 --> 00:12:32,501
CELL PHONE RINGING

232
00:12:35,379 --> 00:12:37,213
- Yo, Jamal.
- JAMAL: What's up, man?

233
00:12:37,214 --> 00:12:39,591
We're heading to the park.
Come ball with us.

234
00:12:39,592 --> 00:12:41,801
Look, nah, man. Nah.
I'm looking for a job.

235
00:12:41,802 --> 00:12:44,721
\an8Dude, you can do that any time.
We need you for two-on-two.

236
00:12:44,722 --> 00:12:46,431
\an8Look, naw, man.
I can't right now.

237
00:12:46,432 --> 00:12:48,851
Come on, Zay.
Just give me an hour.

238
00:12:53,898 --> 00:12:55,316
\an8Look, one hour, man.

239
00:12:55,774 --> 00:12:56,984
RAP MUSIC PLAYING

240
00:12:58,152 --> 00:13:00,029
- JAMAL: Zay, break the screen.
- No. No.

241
00:13:00,905 --> 00:13:03,073
He can't shoot. He can't shoot.
He can't shoot.

242
00:13:04,074 --> 00:13:05,784
RINGING

243
00:13:06,577 --> 00:13:08,329
ALL SHOUTING INDISTINCTLY

244
00:13:10,289 --> 00:13:11,999
RINGING CONTINUES

245
00:13:14,793 --> 00:13:16,045
What you gonna do, man?

246
00:13:17,338 --> 00:13:18,339
No.

247
00:13:19,006 --> 00:13:20,048
WHOOPS

248
00:13:20,049 --> 00:13:21,216
- ANDRE: Come on. Come on.
- There we go.

249
00:13:21,217 --> 00:13:22,592
Hey, that's two up.
Next game wins.

250
00:13:22,593 --> 00:13:24,552
All right, let's run it back.
Come on, baby!

251
00:13:24,553 --> 00:13:26,054
- ANDRE: Come on. Come on.
- JAMAL: In the post.

252
00:13:26,055 --> 00:13:27,555
Hey, hold on.
Hold up, what time is it?

253
00:13:27,556 --> 00:13:29,683
I don't know.
I left my phone in the car.

254
00:13:33,354 --> 00:13:34,396
Yo, I gotta go!

255
00:13:35,147 --> 00:13:36,231
Yo, Zay.

256
00:13:36,232 --> 00:13:38,483
- Zay, we got one more game, bro.
- ANDRE: Come on, Zay.

257
00:13:38,484 --> 00:13:39,567
Zay!

258
00:13:39,568 --> 00:13:41,987
- Come on, Zay.
- Hey, that means we won.

259
00:13:43,364 --> 00:13:44,823
Yes, sir.

260
00:13:51,413 --> 00:13:52,413
I'm sorry, I...

261
00:13:52,414 --> 00:13:54,583
- I lost track of time.
- I'm driving.

262
00:14:07,346 --> 00:14:09,181
It's 5:39.

263
00:14:10,474 --> 00:14:13,269
Maxwell's stayed open
for 30 extra minutes,

264
00:14:13,394 --> 00:14:15,395
only to have me not show up.
And now,

265
00:14:15,396 --> 00:14:17,397
now I gotta push back
my appointments,

266
00:14:17,398 --> 00:14:18,607
and I have to hope...

267
00:14:19,191 --> 00:14:20,650
Oh, boy, you better hope

268
00:14:20,651 --> 00:14:22,902
they give me
the same discount tomorrow

269
00:14:22,903 --> 00:14:24,862
they were planning
on giving me today.

270
00:14:24,863 --> 00:14:26,906
I called them three times

271
00:14:26,907 --> 00:14:28,658
asking them
for five extra minutes.

272
00:14:28,659 --> 00:14:31,327
- Five extra minutes.
- Mom, I said I was sorry.

273
00:14:31,328 --> 00:14:34,206
I let you use my car.

274
00:14:34,873 --> 00:14:37,543
You turned around
and made me look irresponsible.

275
00:14:40,004 --> 00:14:41,755
And why are you so sweaty?

276
00:14:44,633 --> 00:14:45,883
LAUGHS IN DISBELIEF

277
00:14:45,884 --> 00:14:49,221
Oh, no, you didn't.
No, you didn't.

278
00:14:49,805 --> 00:14:51,264
You lied to me?

279
00:14:51,265 --> 00:14:53,224
You told me you were
going to look for a job.

280
00:14:53,225 --> 00:14:55,685
I was. They were closed.
What am I supposed to do?

281
00:14:55,686 --> 00:14:58,564
What are you...
You're supposed to keep looking!

282
00:14:59,148 --> 00:15:01,899
Not give up at
the first sign of inconvenience.

283
00:15:01,900 --> 00:15:03,276
That's something right there
your father would do.

284
00:15:03,277 --> 00:15:06,155
- Well, I ain't him!
- You acting like him.

285
00:15:08,616 --> 00:15:09,867
Boy.

286
00:15:10,534 --> 00:15:11,535
Ooh.

287
00:15:25,049 --> 00:15:26,424
CYNTHIA: I don't know, Liz.

288
00:15:26,425 --> 00:15:28,301
I mean, seriously,
there are moments

289
00:15:28,302 --> 00:15:30,429
when I just feel like
I'm gonna lose it.

290
00:15:31,138 --> 00:15:33,765
Yeah, I mean, I love that boy
with my whole heart,

291
00:15:33,766 --> 00:15:36,935
but I literally cannot be
his mother and his father.

292
00:15:38,562 --> 00:15:40,564
No, I get it. I do get it.

293
00:15:41,273 --> 00:15:44,317
Yeah, I'm just...
I'm asking you to pray for him.

294
00:15:44,318 --> 00:15:45,611
And for me.

295
00:16:01,502 --> 00:16:03,419
Our top three
distribution accounts

296
00:16:03,420 --> 00:16:04,504
are the same as last year.

297
00:16:04,505 --> 00:16:08,758
GymFit is still number one
at 4.5 million a year.

298
00:16:08,759 --> 00:16:10,885
But with their president
stepping down,

299
00:16:10,886 --> 00:16:12,804
that's also our main concern.

300
00:16:12,805 --> 00:16:15,056
Our five-year agreement
with them is up next summer.

301
00:16:15,057 --> 00:16:17,642
Yeah. Any word on their vote?

302
00:16:17,643 --> 00:16:19,310
They haven't announced
anything yet,

303
00:16:19,311 --> 00:16:21,021
but we're ready to connect
as soon as they do.

304
00:16:22,481 --> 00:16:23,898
If we lose
that GymFit account...

305
00:16:23,899 --> 00:16:25,525
If we lose the GymFit account,

306
00:16:25,526 --> 00:16:26,734
I'd say you have
about four months

307
00:16:26,735 --> 00:16:28,946
before you'd have to start
making some difficult choices.

308
00:16:30,656 --> 00:16:31,864
One more thing
I need to bring up.

309
00:16:31,865 --> 00:16:32,949
Slayer Sports,

310
00:16:32,950 --> 00:16:34,617
they're developing
a line of niche equipment

311
00:16:34,618 --> 00:16:36,744
that will directly
compete with us.

312
00:16:36,745 --> 00:16:38,079
I don't know
how soon they'll be ready,

313
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:39,497
but we need
to keep an eye on them.

314
00:16:39,498 --> 00:16:41,125
Hey, I agree.

315
00:16:41,709 --> 00:16:43,543
- Thank you, Emmett.
- No problem.

316
00:16:43,544 --> 00:16:45,045
- KNOCK ON DOOR
- RECEPTIONIST: Mr. Moore.

317
00:16:45,713 --> 00:16:48,548
There's a young man,
Isaiah Wright, here to see you.

318
00:16:48,549 --> 00:16:50,968
- Yes, I'll be right out.
- RECEPTIONIST: Okay.

319
00:16:54,805 --> 00:16:55,806
Isaiah?

320
00:16:58,225 --> 00:16:59,226
How are you?

321
00:16:59,893 --> 00:17:01,645
Oh. I'm good.

322
00:17:02,062 --> 00:17:04,981
Uh, I just wanted to talk to you
for a minute.

323
00:17:04,982 --> 00:17:06,983
I've been thinking
about your questions.

324
00:17:06,984 --> 00:17:09,402
Okay. I'd love
to hear your thoughts.

325
00:17:09,403 --> 00:17:10,529
Yeah. Um...

326
00:17:12,197 --> 00:17:15,868
You know, as far as, you know,
how I wanna grow this next year,

327
00:17:17,369 --> 00:17:20,539
I guess, you know, I wanna learn
to take on more responsibility

328
00:17:21,248 --> 00:17:23,374
and, you know,
learn some new skills.

329
00:17:23,375 --> 00:17:24,459
That's good.

330
00:17:24,460 --> 00:17:26,170
And then you asked,

331
00:17:26,879 --> 00:17:29,089
you know,
what kind of man I wanna be,

332
00:17:29,757 --> 00:17:31,591
and I want to be a good man,
you know,

333
00:17:31,592 --> 00:17:34,136
someone that can
get the job done.

334
00:17:35,596 --> 00:17:37,389
Also, you asked, um,

335
00:17:38,098 --> 00:17:39,557
you know,
what I want people to think,

336
00:17:39,558 --> 00:17:41,727
you know,
when they see me coming.

337
00:17:42,478 --> 00:17:44,980
And, um, I want them to see
someone they respect. So...

338
00:17:46,273 --> 00:17:49,693
Yeah, that's, uh... That's it.

339
00:17:51,111 --> 00:17:52,195
Okay.

340
00:17:52,196 --> 00:17:55,365
So, are you looking
for full-time work or part-time?

341
00:17:55,949 --> 00:17:57,034
Uh...

342
00:17:58,285 --> 00:18:01,412
Well, CLICKS TONGUE
start part-time.

343
00:18:01,413 --> 00:18:02,581
Okay.

344
00:18:03,707 --> 00:18:06,542
Would you be willing
to meet with me twice a week

345
00:18:06,543 --> 00:18:09,213
for some mentoring
before your shift starts?

346
00:18:09,797 --> 00:18:12,465
Mentoring? Like for this job?

347
00:18:12,466 --> 00:18:13,801
Well, yes.

348
00:18:14,635 --> 00:18:16,720
But also, some life principles.

349
00:18:17,304 --> 00:18:19,515
Things that you could use
no matter where you're working.

350
00:18:20,098 --> 00:18:23,559
I mean, yeah.
CHUCKLES I guess.

351
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:24,685
Yeah.

352
00:18:24,686 --> 00:18:26,771
Well, let's go
to the factory floor

353
00:18:26,772 --> 00:18:28,898
and I'll show you
what we have available.

354
00:18:28,899 --> 00:18:30,274
I'll connect you with a manager

355
00:18:30,275 --> 00:18:32,193
and finish
the interview process.

356
00:18:32,194 --> 00:18:33,319
- Cool.
- Good?

357
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:34,488
- Yeah.
- All right.

358
00:18:39,451 --> 00:18:40,952
So, what happens in here?

359
00:18:40,953 --> 00:18:43,663
Well, I'll show you the packing
and shipping division first.

360
00:18:43,664 --> 00:18:46,583
Division? CHUCKLES
How big is this place?

361
00:18:48,126 --> 00:18:49,169
BEEPS

362
00:18:52,673 --> 00:18:53,632
Oh.

363
00:18:55,843 --> 00:18:59,471
We make 205 different products
for the fitness arena.

364
00:19:00,347 --> 00:19:04,559
Weights, treadmills, jump ropes,
almost everything in between.

365
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:06,310
We store the pieces

366
00:19:06,311 --> 00:19:08,020
and then we supply distributors

367
00:19:08,021 --> 00:19:10,690
with all the parts
to assemble and sell.

368
00:19:10,691 --> 00:19:13,943
Each day, we fill
600 to 800 orders.

369
00:19:13,944 --> 00:19:15,570
How many people work here?

370
00:19:15,571 --> 00:19:17,406
JOSHUA: In this area, 24.

371
00:19:18,824 --> 00:19:19,825
Todd.

372
00:19:20,450 --> 00:19:22,368
- How you doing?
- Mr. Moore, I'm fine.

373
00:19:22,369 --> 00:19:24,537
- How are you?
- I am good, thank you.

374
00:19:24,538 --> 00:19:25,956
This is Isaiah Wright.

375
00:19:26,415 --> 00:19:27,540
When you have the time,

376
00:19:27,541 --> 00:19:29,959
I want you to take him
through the interview process

377
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:31,210
for part-time work.

378
00:19:31,211 --> 00:19:32,295
Okay.

379
00:19:32,296 --> 00:19:34,797
I'll show him around
and bring him back to you.

380
00:19:34,798 --> 00:19:36,049
Yes, sir.

381
00:19:36,174 --> 00:19:38,426
It's taken me 21 years
to get here.

382
00:19:38,427 --> 00:19:40,094
It's been hard,
but God's been good.

383
00:19:40,095 --> 00:19:41,178
- Yeah.
- MACHINE BEEPS

384
00:19:41,179 --> 00:19:42,597
Oh.

385
00:19:42,598 --> 00:19:44,682
CHUCKLES It's not gonna
run into you,

386
00:19:44,683 --> 00:19:46,809
the scanners will see you
and stop the cart.

387
00:19:46,810 --> 00:19:49,729
Yo, that's... that's crazy, man.
How many of these you got?

388
00:19:49,730 --> 00:19:54,025
We got 10 floor robots
and 75 storage robots,

389
00:19:54,026 --> 00:19:56,027
all programmed by our engineers.

390
00:19:56,028 --> 00:19:57,988
- Oh, nice. Nice.
- Come on.

391
00:20:02,743 --> 00:20:03,911
Take a look.

392
00:20:13,545 --> 00:20:15,255
I ain't never seen
nothing like this.

393
00:20:16,673 --> 00:20:17,673
Cody.

394
00:20:17,674 --> 00:20:18,841
How are they rolling?

395
00:20:18,842 --> 00:20:20,927
Well, none of them
called in sick today,

396
00:20:20,928 --> 00:20:23,721
- so I'm feeling pretty good.
- BOTH LAUGH

397
00:20:23,722 --> 00:20:24,889
This is Isaiah.

398
00:20:24,890 --> 00:20:26,474
Give him a quick explanation
of the system.

399
00:20:26,475 --> 00:20:28,434
- Hey, man. Uh...
- Oh.

400
00:20:28,435 --> 00:20:29,602
Yeah.

401
00:20:29,603 --> 00:20:32,855
Well, CLEARS THROAT basically,
when an order comes in,

402
00:20:32,856 --> 00:20:33,940
one of the bots will pick it up

403
00:20:33,941 --> 00:20:36,067
and take it over
to its specific port.

404
00:20:36,068 --> 00:20:37,944
And then it'll go down
to a conveyer belt

405
00:20:37,945 --> 00:20:39,028
and be placed in a box

406
00:20:39,029 --> 00:20:40,863
that's specifically designed
for that product.

407
00:20:40,864 --> 00:20:43,367
And then it's then labeled
and stacked for shipping.

408
00:20:44,368 --> 00:20:46,119
They're like my best friends.

409
00:20:46,662 --> 00:20:48,705
LAUGHS You got all that?

410
00:20:49,164 --> 00:20:51,332
- Um, yeah.
- LAUGHS

411
00:20:51,333 --> 00:20:52,625
- Thank you, Cody.
- Uh, yes, sir.

412
00:20:52,626 --> 00:20:53,793
- Keep it up.
- Yeah.

413
00:20:53,794 --> 00:20:55,170
- Come on, follow me.
- Good to see you.

414
00:20:55,963 --> 00:20:57,964
- Janelle?
- Yes?

415
00:20:57,965 --> 00:20:59,633
May I introduce you to someone?

416
00:21:00,550 --> 00:21:01,551
Of course.

417
00:21:03,553 --> 00:21:05,388
- Hello there.
- This is Isaiah Wright.

418
00:21:05,389 --> 00:21:07,848
We're talking about him
working part-time with us.

419
00:21:07,849 --> 00:21:10,351
- Nice to meet you, Isaiah.
- Good to meet you.

420
00:21:10,352 --> 00:21:13,271
Janelle oversees
the human resources department.

421
00:21:14,106 --> 00:21:16,816
She has put up with me
since the first day we opened,

422
00:21:16,817 --> 00:21:18,734
and knows about just as much
as I do around here.

423
00:21:18,735 --> 00:21:21,320
But I don't work
as many hours as he does.

424
00:21:21,321 --> 00:21:24,615
And he needs to learn to push
the pause button sometime

425
00:21:24,616 --> 00:21:26,493
and come home with me.

426
00:21:27,244 --> 00:21:29,370
We've also been married
for 35 years.

427
00:21:29,371 --> 00:21:30,955
ALL LAUGHING

428
00:21:30,956 --> 00:21:32,331
- Gotcha.
- JANELLE: Gotcha.

429
00:21:32,332 --> 00:21:34,543
Yeah, you should have
seen your face. LAUGHING

430
00:21:34,668 --> 00:21:35,669
That's what's up.

431
00:21:37,671 --> 00:21:39,338
TODD: And our
only part-time opening

432
00:21:39,339 --> 00:21:41,632
is Monday, Wednesdays,
and Fridays from 9:00 to 5:00.

433
00:21:41,633 --> 00:21:43,468
- That'll work?
- Yeah.

434
00:21:44,553 --> 00:21:48,139
Okay. Your training starts
on Monday. Please, be on time.

435
00:21:48,140 --> 00:21:50,100
It takes everyone here
to stay on track.

436
00:21:51,226 --> 00:21:54,645
And this is your key card.
Don't lose it.

437
00:21:54,646 --> 00:21:56,189
SIZZLING

438
00:22:00,610 --> 00:22:02,487
- Hey.
- Hey.

439
00:22:03,864 --> 00:22:05,073
What'd you do today?

440
00:22:05,866 --> 00:22:08,535
Not much.
Just stopped by Moore Fitness.

441
00:22:09,911 --> 00:22:11,163
Moore Fitness?

442
00:22:11,955 --> 00:22:13,040
Why?

443
00:22:13,665 --> 00:22:17,085
You know, they were,
you know, hiring some guy. Yeah.

444
00:22:19,588 --> 00:22:20,797
Who?

445
00:22:22,674 --> 00:22:24,760
This guy. LAUGHS

446
00:22:25,343 --> 00:22:26,762
Oh, my goodness!

447
00:22:26,887 --> 00:22:27,887
Isaiah,

448
00:22:27,888 --> 00:22:30,139
- you got a job at Moore Fitness?
- Yes, ma'am.

449
00:22:30,140 --> 00:22:33,017
Oh, I'm so proud of you.

450
00:22:33,018 --> 00:22:35,686
- When do you start?
- 9:00 a.m. Monday.

451
00:22:35,687 --> 00:22:39,066
That's what I'm talking about.
You have made my day.

452
00:22:39,524 --> 00:22:41,317
Ooh. Do you know that
he helped your Uncle Tony

453
00:22:41,318 --> 00:22:42,610
for several years?

454
00:22:42,611 --> 00:22:44,570
- Uncle T? Uncle Tony?
- Mm-hmm.

455
00:22:44,571 --> 00:22:47,282
He discipled him, helped him
with his work and stuff.

456
00:22:48,450 --> 00:22:50,118
Discipled him?
What does that mean?

457
00:22:50,786 --> 00:22:53,038
You know,
it's like when one person...

458
00:22:53,580 --> 00:22:55,207
It's... It's kind of...

459
00:22:56,416 --> 00:22:58,084
You need to
come to church with me.

460
00:22:58,085 --> 00:23:00,753
Ma, we already
talked about this.

461
00:23:00,754 --> 00:23:02,463
Church? That's...
That's your thing.

462
00:23:02,464 --> 00:23:05,508
Isaiah, God wants you
to know Him.

463
00:23:05,509 --> 00:23:07,010
And I ain't hiding from Him.

464
00:23:07,135 --> 00:23:08,929
I'm right here and He can
find me if he wants to.

465
00:23:09,096 --> 00:23:11,514
But I ain't gotta go to a church
building for Him to see me.

466
00:23:11,515 --> 00:23:13,016
Okay, okay.

467
00:23:14,643 --> 00:23:17,478
Are you gonna see Mr. Moore
very frequently on your job?

468
00:23:17,479 --> 00:23:19,772
Yeah. He wants to meet,
you know, twice a week

469
00:23:19,773 --> 00:23:21,899
before my shift for mentoring.

470
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:23,819
- Something like that.
- Oh.

471
00:23:25,278 --> 00:23:26,654
- Okay.
- Yeah.

472
00:23:26,655 --> 00:23:28,531
Dinner will be ready
in 10 minutes.

473
00:23:28,532 --> 00:23:29,616
All right.

474
00:23:36,164 --> 00:23:38,916
Oh, Lord. I see what you're
doing. I see what you're doing.

475
00:23:38,917 --> 00:23:41,044
I see you working. Ooh!

476
00:23:41,586 --> 00:23:45,298
Oh, draw him to you, Lord.
Just draw him to you.

477
00:23:48,552 --> 00:23:50,512
JOSHUA: I want each employee
to remember...

478
00:23:51,138 --> 00:23:53,140
I'm responsible
for this company.

479
00:23:53,849 --> 00:23:55,975
And I want those
under my leadership

480
00:23:55,976 --> 00:23:57,309
to help me do well.

481
00:23:57,310 --> 00:23:59,854
The same way
that they will want others

482
00:23:59,855 --> 00:24:02,691
under their leadership to help
them do well in the future.

483
00:24:03,567 --> 00:24:07,654
So, treat others the way
you want to be treated.

484
00:24:09,030 --> 00:24:10,740
Even if you don't like them,

485
00:24:11,158 --> 00:24:13,284
give those in authority
the same respect

486
00:24:13,285 --> 00:24:15,120
that you'd want them
to give you.

487
00:24:17,330 --> 00:24:18,331
Got it?

488
00:24:19,708 --> 00:24:21,710
Yeah. I got it.

489
00:24:23,420 --> 00:24:26,005
All right, this is where
the magic happens.

490
00:24:26,006 --> 00:24:28,090
- Wanda has to make sure...
- Hi.

491
00:24:28,091 --> 00:24:30,217
...that each box
is properly sealed for delivery.

492
00:24:30,218 --> 00:24:31,760
Then, Diego and Carlos,

493
00:24:31,761 --> 00:24:34,388
they add a label and they stack
each box for shipping.

494
00:24:34,389 --> 00:24:37,057
But each of them
knows how to work every station,

495
00:24:37,058 --> 00:24:38,475
so they can rotate if need be.

496
00:24:38,476 --> 00:24:39,518

518
00:26:33,591 --> 00:26:36,051
Hey, sorry, man.
I can... I can take over.

519
00:26:36,052 --> 00:26:37,262
You got an emergency?

520
00:26:38,513 --> 00:26:40,097
Nah, man. It's my bad.

521
00:26:40,098 --> 00:26:42,141
- Where's your work vest?
- Oh.

522
00:26:42,142 --> 00:26:45,061
- Yeah. I gotta go get that.
- Have you even clocked in yet?

523
00:26:46,896 --> 00:26:47,938
Not yet.

524
00:26:47,939 --> 00:26:51,443
Isaiah, you're 45 minutes late
and it's your third day.

525
00:26:53,778 --> 00:26:56,031
I can't do my job
when I'm covering for you!

526
00:26:59,743 --> 00:27:00,826
No, and it doesn't matter.

527
00:27:00,827 --> 00:27:03,912
LeBron has a championship
with every team he's played for.

528
00:27:03,913 --> 00:27:05,164
Okay, how is that impressive?

529
00:27:05,165 --> 00:27:07,791
Okay, Jordan made it
to the Finals six times.

530
00:27:07,792 --> 00:27:09,251
How many times did he win?

531
00:27:09,252 --> 00:27:10,336
- Six times!
- Six times!

532
00:27:10,337 --> 00:27:12,129
MAN: Only with the Bulls, okay?

533
00:27:12,130 --> 00:27:14,256
LeBron won with Miami,
Cleveland...

534
00:27:14,257 --> 00:27:16,467
Isaiah, Mr. Moore would like to
see you in the conference room.

535
00:27:16,468 --> 00:27:18,218
CURTIS: Okay,
Michael Jeffrey Jordan

536
00:27:18,219 --> 00:27:21,181
elevated the whole
basketball game.

537
00:27:21,723 --> 00:27:24,351
This is way more aggressive
than we expected.

538
00:27:24,476 --> 00:27:25,809
I mean, it is a smaller account.

539
00:27:25,810 --> 00:27:28,270
It's 40,000 a year,
so it won't hurt us much.

540
00:27:28,271 --> 00:27:30,398
But we need to shore up
our larger accounts.

541
00:27:30,857 --> 00:27:31,858
Yeah.

542
00:27:33,068 --> 00:27:35,486
I had never even heard
of Slayer Sports six months ago.

543
00:27:35,487 --> 00:27:37,989
They've got backing
and they're hungry.

544
00:27:39,157 --> 00:27:41,033
But we don't need them
taking more from us,

545
00:27:41,034 --> 00:27:42,369
so I'll keep you updated.

546
00:27:49,334 --> 00:27:51,043
I had breakfast for you
this morning.

547
00:27:51,044 --> 00:27:52,337
What happened?

548
00:27:52,962 --> 00:27:54,047
I, um...

549
00:27:55,090 --> 00:27:57,592
I overslept.
I forgot to set my alarm.

550
00:27:58,593 --> 00:27:59,594
Okay.

551
00:28:00,303 --> 00:28:04,765
Well, you have a lukewarm
breakfast burrito, orange juice

552
00:28:04,766 --> 00:28:06,350
and cold hash browns
if you want.

553
00:28:06,351 --> 00:28:08,103
Nah, nah. I'm good.

554
00:28:10,647 --> 00:28:13,066
You know, actually,
I'm starving, so...

555
00:28:22,742 --> 00:28:24,244
Some thoughts for today.

556
00:28:25,662 --> 00:28:27,413
When you miss your commitments,

557
00:28:27,414 --> 00:28:29,916
it's hard not to see it
as disrespectful.

558
00:28:30,458 --> 00:28:33,127
When you're 45 minutes
late for work,

559
00:28:33,128 --> 00:28:35,629
it forces people
to have to cover for you.

560
00:28:35,630 --> 00:28:39,466
And if you have a good reason,
they'll be fine.

561
00:28:39,467 --> 00:28:42,804
If not,
they'll feel disrespected.

562
00:28:44,180 --> 00:28:47,559
You don't need people wondering
if you can do your job.

563
00:28:47,684 --> 00:28:51,229
You need them believing
that you can do your job,

564
00:28:51,771 --> 00:28:53,523
and respecting you
for doing it well.

565
00:28:55,233 --> 00:28:57,277
So, let me be blunt.

566
00:29:00,280 --> 00:29:04,242
A big part of becoming a man
is showing up.

567
00:29:05,660 --> 00:29:07,287
Can you do that, Isaiah?

568
00:29:08,663 --> 00:29:09,664
Yes, sir.

569
00:29:10,582 --> 00:29:14,127
So, I suggest that
you plan ahead.

570
00:29:14,752 --> 00:29:17,672
Get the rest you need,
set your alarm,

571
00:29:17,797 --> 00:29:20,090
and give yourself
the time to get here.

572
00:29:20,091 --> 00:29:21,968
That shows respect for others.

573
00:29:22,886 --> 00:29:24,637
And whenever
you're supposed to be here,

574
00:29:26,473 --> 00:29:27,599
show up.

575
00:29:34,564 --> 00:29:36,356
WOMAN: He just started
working there?

576
00:29:36,357 --> 00:29:37,317
CYNTHIA: Yes!

577
00:29:37,318 --> 00:29:39,610
And he didn't even wanna tell me
what happened yesterday.

578
00:29:39,611 --> 00:29:42,029
But you know what? I could tell
by the look on his face

579
00:29:42,030 --> 00:29:43,655
that something was wrong.

580
00:29:43,656 --> 00:29:47,451
See, when it's your child,
you can tell it on their face.

581
00:29:47,452 --> 00:29:51,205
All I'm saying is Darren was
way too flippant with his jobs

582
00:29:51,206 --> 00:29:52,956
and he kept losing 'em.

583
00:29:52,957 --> 00:29:54,500
So, I'mma tell you
what I'm not gonna do

584
00:29:54,501 --> 00:29:56,668
is sit by and watch Isaiah
start doing the same thing.

585
00:29:56,669 --> 00:29:58,045
- KEISHA: Right.
- It's not happening.

586
00:29:58,046 --> 00:29:59,755
He's already dealing
with so much anger

587
00:29:59,756 --> 00:30:01,173
in his heart towards his father,

588
00:30:01,174 --> 00:30:04,676
so, seriously,
I just need some prayer support.

589
00:30:04,677 --> 00:30:06,386
That's why
you called your sister.

590
00:30:06,387 --> 00:30:07,679
Yeah. That's exactly why.

591
00:30:07,680 --> 00:30:09,014
She's gonna be here any minute.

592
00:30:09,015 --> 00:30:10,725
And I'm so glad
'cause I need to see her.

593
00:30:10,850 --> 00:30:12,392
DANIELLE: Hey, Aunt Cynthia.

594
00:30:12,393 --> 00:30:14,853
Danielle! Oh, my goodness.

595
00:30:14,854 --> 00:30:18,023
I did not know that you were
coming. What a surprise.

596
00:30:18,024 --> 00:30:20,400
I thought you were at college.
Girl, how are you doing?

597
00:30:20,401 --> 00:30:22,236
DANIELLE: I'm good.
I'm just on break.

598
00:30:22,237 --> 00:30:24,112
- Mom's parking the car.
- Okay. All right.

599
00:30:24,113 --> 00:30:25,740
- Hey, Danielle baby.
- Hey.

600
00:30:26,658 --> 00:30:28,617
CYNTHIA: Elizabeth! Oh!

601
00:30:28,618 --> 00:30:30,160
ELIZABETH: Hey, sis.

602
00:30:30,161 --> 00:30:33,581
Girl, it is so good to see you.
It has been too long.

603
00:30:34,624 --> 00:30:37,876
I love it when my sister
comes to see me.

604
00:30:37,877 --> 00:30:39,920
Okay, have a seat.
I'mma get you a cup of coffee.

605
00:30:39,921 --> 00:30:41,255
ELIZABETH: Thank you.

606
00:30:41,256 --> 00:30:42,464
Hey, ladies.

607
00:30:42,465 --> 00:30:44,007
- How are y'all doing?
- Hey there.

608
00:30:44,008 --> 00:30:46,553
- Honey, that bag.
- ELIZABETH: Good to see y'all.

609
00:30:46,678 --> 00:30:48,972
And them pants,
my thighs can't get in.

610
00:30:49,097 --> 00:30:50,180
WOMAN: Stop it.

611
00:30:50,181 --> 00:30:52,057
Now, Danielle,
do you still like caramel?

612
00:30:52,058 --> 00:30:54,602
- You remembered.
- Of course I did.

613
00:30:55,270 --> 00:30:58,605
- Now, Liz, is she coming?
- Thank you. Yes, she's here.

614
00:30:58,606 --> 00:31:00,482
She's just in the car
finishing up a phone call.

615
00:31:00,483 --> 00:31:01,776
So, who is this again?

616
00:31:02,360 --> 00:31:05,779
Well, when my sister tells me
that she needs prayer support,

617
00:31:05,780 --> 00:31:07,656
honey, I bring prayer support.

618
00:31:07,657 --> 00:31:08,740
CLARA: Hey.

619
00:31:08,741 --> 00:31:10,367
Am I in the right place?

620
00:31:10,368 --> 00:31:13,537
Miss Clara. Yes, you are.

621
00:31:13,538 --> 00:31:16,833
- I'm so glad to see you.
- Oh.

622
00:31:17,584 --> 00:31:20,419
Hello, sweet Cynthia.

623
00:31:20,420 --> 00:31:22,088
How you doing, darling?

624
00:31:22,213 --> 00:31:24,423
I'm doing better
now that you're here.

625
00:31:24,424 --> 00:31:27,635
- Please, come sit with us.
- Okay. All right, darling.

626
00:31:28,219 --> 00:31:32,681
So, Isaiah is not running away
from responsibility.

627
00:31:32,682 --> 00:31:35,310
He just hasn't learned
how to embrace it.

628
00:31:35,935 --> 00:31:37,936
That's good.
He gotta embrace it.

629
00:31:37,937 --> 00:31:39,354
But what I'm saying is

630
00:31:39,355 --> 00:31:41,733
he hasn't had a good man
in the home to be a role model.

631
00:31:42,233 --> 00:31:44,276
So, he just sees me
taking care of everything,

632
00:31:44,277 --> 00:31:45,777
but no matter how much I do,

633
00:31:45,778 --> 00:31:48,196
it's hard for a woman
to call out the man in her son.

634
00:31:48,197 --> 00:31:50,741
- KEISHA: True.
- You know, Tony's been helpful,

635
00:31:50,742 --> 00:31:53,535
but he lives an hour away
on the other side of Charlotte.

636
00:31:53,536 --> 00:31:55,622
I just want to cover him
in prayer.

637
00:31:56,456 --> 00:31:58,832
But it's not like
it's an emergency.

638
00:31:58,833 --> 00:32:00,000
Like, he has time.

639
00:32:00,001 --> 00:32:02,337
We don't have to act like
this is overly urgent, right?

640
00:32:03,254 --> 00:32:05,256
Oh, yes, we do, dear heart.

641
00:32:05,798 --> 00:32:09,343
We can't treat prayer
like it's some spare tire

642
00:32:09,344 --> 00:32:12,430
that you only pull out
in an emergency. No.

643
00:32:12,555 --> 00:32:15,182
Prayer has to be
more like the steering wheel

644
00:32:15,183 --> 00:32:18,935
that you hold tightly every day,
no matter where you are going.

645
00:32:18,936 --> 00:32:22,064
Mm-hmm. Now, that's good.
That's good.

646
00:32:22,065 --> 00:32:24,232
Well, look,
all I meant was that...

647
00:32:24,233 --> 00:32:25,734
Shh. Listen,
shut your mouth now.

648
00:32:25,735 --> 00:32:27,903
This woman
is on a whole 'nother level.

649
00:32:27,904 --> 00:32:29,989
- Okay.
- Well, if I may...

650
00:32:31,366 --> 00:32:33,116
I suggest that we start

651
00:32:33,117 --> 00:32:36,161
by praising the Lord
for who He is.

652
00:32:36,162 --> 00:32:37,329
ELIZABETH: Hallelujah.

653
00:32:37,330 --> 00:32:41,500
And then we pray that the Lord
will open Isaiah's eyes

654
00:32:41,501 --> 00:32:45,087
so that he could see himself
the way that the Lord sees him.

655
00:32:45,088 --> 00:32:48,675
And that he would
realize his need for the Lord.

656
00:32:49,801 --> 00:32:52,469
And that the Lord
would capture his heart...

657
00:32:52,470 --> 00:32:53,553
KEISHA: Yes.

658
00:32:53,554 --> 00:32:55,806
...and build him up
to be the man

659
00:32:55,807 --> 00:32:57,599
that the Lord wants him to be.

660
00:32:57,600 --> 00:33:00,018
Mm-hmm! Now, that is good!

661
00:33:00,019 --> 00:33:02,604
Miss Clara, I need you
to come by here more often.

662
00:33:02,605 --> 00:33:03,773
Keisha needs you.

663
00:33:12,031 --> 00:33:14,200
- CLARA: And anyone, Lord...
- WOMAN: Thank you.

664
00:33:15,034 --> 00:33:18,120
...that the enemy might
try to use to pull him away.

665
00:33:18,121 --> 00:33:20,080
WOMAN: Yes. Do it, Father.

666
00:33:20,081 --> 00:33:21,540
Yes, Father, thank you.

667
00:33:21,541 --> 00:33:24,419
CLARA: Lord, put your hand
on his life...

668
00:33:24,544 --> 00:33:25,544
WOMAN: Yes.

669
00:33:25,545 --> 00:33:27,838
- CLARA: ...and help him, God.
- Hey, can I help you?

670
00:33:27,839 --> 00:33:30,424
Yeah, is this a hair salon
or a prayer salon?

671
00:33:30,425 --> 00:33:32,759
- CLARA: Lord, stir him up.
- CYNTHIA: Well, today it's both.

672
00:33:32,760 --> 00:33:33,928
What do you need?

673
00:33:34,053 --> 00:33:37,556
CLARA: Stir him up
to want to know you, Jesus.

674
00:33:37,557 --> 00:33:39,307
- I need both.
- CLARA: Yes.

675
00:33:39,308 --> 00:33:41,268
Girl, you wanna join us?

676
00:33:41,269 --> 00:33:42,728
- Yeah, my edges need to be...
- Come.

677
00:33:42,729 --> 00:33:44,062
- ...delivered and set free.
- Come on.

678
00:33:44,063 --> 00:33:45,231
I need both.

679
00:33:50,528 --> 00:33:53,321
Whoa. Isaiah is in the building.

680
00:33:53,322 --> 00:33:55,532
- Hey.
- You're 15 minutes early.

681
00:33:55,533 --> 00:33:56,950
Yeah, trying not to be
late again.

682
00:33:56,951 --> 00:33:58,161
No, we're not gonna
do that again.

683
00:33:58,286 --> 00:34:00,036
- No. No, sir.
- All right, guess what?

684
00:34:00,037 --> 00:34:01,247
You've got a hot breakfast
this time.

685
00:34:01,372 --> 00:34:02,874
Okay. Yeah, I could smell it
from the parking lot.

686
00:34:04,083 --> 00:34:05,709
- From the parking lot?
- Hey.

687
00:34:05,710 --> 00:34:06,711
BOTH LAUGHING

688
00:34:07,128 --> 00:34:09,589
So, eventually,
I learned to listen.

689
00:34:11,674 --> 00:34:13,592
It's embarrassing
to think about it now.

690
00:34:13,593 --> 00:34:17,262
How at 24, I thought I could
have figured out life by myself.

691
00:34:17,263 --> 00:34:20,975
But when you fall on your face
as many times as I did,

692
00:34:21,768 --> 00:34:23,102
you finally realize

693
00:34:24,395 --> 00:34:27,230
it's better to learn from
the mistakes of other people

694
00:34:27,231 --> 00:34:29,274
than to continually
make your own.

695
00:34:29,275 --> 00:34:31,818
- LAUGHS
- Yeah, I get that.

696
00:34:31,819 --> 00:34:35,697
Oh, man, I used to get
into arguments all the time.

697
00:34:35,698 --> 00:34:37,909
I thought I looked like a big
man, standing my ground.

698
00:34:38,868 --> 00:34:42,622
Then my mother said something
to me that I've never forgotten.

699
00:34:44,624 --> 00:34:45,833
She said,

700
00:34:46,834 --> 00:34:50,838
"You need to be
more of a fountain than a drain,

701
00:34:52,548 --> 00:34:55,426
"and you need to start giving
more than you're taking."

702
00:34:56,928 --> 00:34:58,763
The more I thought about it...

703
00:35:00,306 --> 00:35:02,934
I was using people
to reach my own goals,

704
00:35:03,559 --> 00:35:05,186
without loving them at all.

705
00:35:07,146 --> 00:35:09,482
And that's the thought
that I have for you today.

706
00:35:10,191 --> 00:35:11,818
Adopt that mentality.

707
00:35:13,402 --> 00:35:16,197
Be a fountain, not a drain.

708
00:35:17,907 --> 00:35:19,617
I want to read you something.

709
00:35:21,869 --> 00:35:24,372
It's out of Galatians 5.

710
00:35:29,168 --> 00:35:31,086
"For you have been
called to live in freedom,

711
00:35:31,087 --> 00:35:32,587
"my brothers and sisters.

712
00:35:32,588 --> 00:35:35,966
"But don't use your freedom
to satisfy your sinful nature.

713
00:35:35,967 --> 00:35:39,679
"Instead, use your freedom
to serve one another in love.

714
00:35:40,304 --> 00:35:43,766
"For the whole law can be summed
up in this one command.

715
00:35:44,642 --> 00:35:46,477
"Love your neighbor
as yourself."

716
00:35:48,688 --> 00:35:51,524
What do you mean
by "sinful nature"?

717
00:35:52,149 --> 00:35:53,442
Hmm.

718
00:35:56,237 --> 00:35:58,238
Well, the Bible tells us

719
00:35:58,239 --> 00:35:59,991
that we all
have a sinful nature.

720
00:36:01,409 --> 00:36:03,870
Selfishness, pride,
greed, bitterness.

721
00:36:05,121 --> 00:36:06,747
Yet God still loves us.

722
00:36:08,708 --> 00:36:11,084
So, he sent his son, Jesus,
to die on the cross

723
00:36:11,085 --> 00:36:13,379
to pay the debt
that we owed for sin.

724
00:36:14,297 --> 00:36:16,757
Then he raised Jesus
from the dead,

725
00:36:17,592 --> 00:36:20,468
so that we could be in
a right relationship with Him,

726
00:36:20,469 --> 00:36:22,388
if we put our faith in Jesus.

727
00:36:23,681 --> 00:36:25,057
He is our way to freedom.

728
00:36:28,311 --> 00:36:32,398
When we follow Jesus
and devote ourselves to him,

729
00:36:32,982 --> 00:36:36,611
he bears fruit through us
that gives God glory.

730
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:39,863
Love, joy, peace,

731
00:36:39,864 --> 00:36:42,824
patience, kindness,

732
00:36:42,825 --> 00:36:47,162
goodness, faithfulness,
gentleness, self-control.

733
00:36:47,163 --> 00:36:48,456
Hmm.

734
00:36:48,831 --> 00:36:50,333
That's what He wants us to do.

735
00:36:51,709 --> 00:36:53,878
That's the kind of man
I want to be.

736
00:37:00,134 --> 00:37:01,260
I'll tell you what.

737
00:37:04,055 --> 00:37:05,306
If you're interested,

738
00:37:05,973 --> 00:37:07,350
join me this Saturday.

739
00:37:08,434 --> 00:37:10,560
My church
has an outreach downtown.

740
00:37:10,561 --> 00:37:12,354
Every month, we get together

741
00:37:12,355 --> 00:37:15,358
and we give out food
to people who are struggling.

742
00:37:16,484 --> 00:37:17,984
We usually start at 9:00.

743
00:37:17,985 --> 00:37:19,736
You do this?

744
00:37:19,737 --> 00:37:22,822
Every month. We help sponsor it.

745
00:37:22,823 --> 00:37:24,158
Come on, man.

746
00:37:24,784 --> 00:37:27,328
Hey, if you'd like,
I'll pick you up.

747
00:37:30,122 --> 00:37:31,539
Yeah. I'm down.

748
00:37:31,540 --> 00:37:33,292
All right. LAUGHS

749
00:37:39,840 --> 00:37:41,967
CHRISTIAN HIP-HOP MUSIC
PLAYING

750
00:37:41,968 --> 00:37:43,052
INAUDIBLE

751
00:38:39,191 --> 00:38:40,860
Hey, you okay?

752
00:38:41,736 --> 00:38:43,029
Yeah. I, uh...

753
00:38:43,821 --> 00:38:45,572
I just never did
anything like this before.

754
00:38:45,573 --> 00:38:47,157
- JOSHUA LAUGHS
- Well, you did good.

755
00:38:47,158 --> 00:38:48,826
A lot of people
got helped today.

756
00:38:50,327 --> 00:38:53,122
Isaiah, you want to
join us for dinner?

757
00:38:53,664 --> 00:38:54,706
It's my turn to cook.

758
00:38:54,707 --> 00:38:57,500
I'm not as good as Janelle,
but it shouldn't be too bad.

759
00:38:57,501 --> 00:39:00,337
Don't believe that.
He's very good.

760
00:39:01,088 --> 00:39:03,882
- Hey, yeah, I'm down.
- Well, you guys wait here.

761
00:39:03,883 --> 00:39:05,968
I'll get the car
and we'll head to the house.

762
00:39:15,561 --> 00:39:17,437
JANELLE: Sometimes
being the president

763
00:39:17,438 --> 00:39:20,148
means business calls
on the weekend.

764
00:39:20,149 --> 00:39:21,650
No, I understand.

765
00:39:22,109 --> 00:39:23,694
Hey, who's this?

766
00:39:25,071 --> 00:39:27,322
That is our son Jalen.

767
00:39:27,323 --> 00:39:29,365
Oh, what? I didn't know
you had a son.

768
00:39:29,366 --> 00:39:30,493
I mean, where's he at?

769
00:39:32,703 --> 00:39:34,246
Jalen died at 17.

770
00:39:40,961 --> 00:39:42,003
Oh, I'm...

771
00:39:42,004 --> 00:39:44,507
I'm sorry. I...
I didn't realize.

772
00:39:45,007 --> 00:39:46,383
It's okay, Isaiah.

773
00:39:47,384 --> 00:39:50,596
When Jalen was growing up,

774
00:39:52,223 --> 00:39:57,061
Joshua was so driven in business
to be a success.

775
00:39:58,104 --> 00:39:59,939
And it tested our marriage.

776
00:40:01,607 --> 00:40:06,236
One evening, Jalen went to ride
with his friends to a party,

777
00:40:06,237 --> 00:40:09,739
and a drunk driver
ran a red light

778
00:40:09,740 --> 00:40:11,659
and hit them on his side.

779
00:40:14,495 --> 00:40:17,123
We never got to say goodbye.

780
00:40:18,165 --> 00:40:19,458
For a while,

781
00:40:20,876 --> 00:40:25,089
Joshua blamed everybody,
even me.

782
00:40:26,966 --> 00:40:29,593
It almost ended our marriage.

783
00:40:31,887 --> 00:40:33,889
One of the older men
in our church,

784
00:40:34,598 --> 00:40:38,269
a mechanic,
reached out to Joshua

785
00:40:39,645 --> 00:40:41,647
and started meeting with him.

786
00:40:43,482 --> 00:40:45,233
And he helped Joshua

787
00:40:45,234 --> 00:40:50,697
reshape his entire view
of life and faith

788
00:40:50,698 --> 00:40:52,491
according to the Bible.

789
00:40:53,951 --> 00:40:56,327
And that's when I saw my husband

790
00:40:56,328 --> 00:40:59,080
become a disciple
of Jesus Christ.

791
00:40:59,081 --> 00:41:00,708
It changed him.

792
00:41:02,501 --> 00:41:05,795
So, we don't just
call ourselves Christians.

793
00:41:05,796 --> 00:41:07,965
We are devoted to Jesus.

794
00:41:11,594 --> 00:41:15,139
And we will do anything
He calls us to do.

795
00:41:40,706 --> 00:41:42,040
"For all have sinned

796
00:41:42,041 --> 00:41:44,210
"and fall short
of the glory of God.

797
00:41:45,544 --> 00:41:48,838
"But God demonstrates
His own love for us in this...

798
00:41:48,839 --> 00:41:52,343
"while we were still sinners,
Christ died for us.

799
00:41:54,929 --> 00:41:57,056
"For the wages of sin is death,

800
00:41:58,140 --> 00:42:00,225
"but the gift of God
is eternal life

801
00:42:00,226 --> 00:42:02,228
"in Christ Jesus our Lord.

802
00:42:03,771 --> 00:42:06,732
"If you declare with your mouth
'Jesus is Lord'

803
00:42:07,399 --> 00:42:08,900
"and believe in your heart

804
00:42:08,901 --> 00:42:10,903
"that God raised him
from the dead,

805
00:42:11,654 --> 00:42:13,280
"you will be saved.

806
00:42:14,573 --> 00:42:17,450
"For it is with your heart
that you believe,

807
00:42:17,451 --> 00:42:19,035
"and it is with your mouth

808
00:42:19,036 --> 00:42:21,747
"that you profess your faith

811
00:42:35,469 --> 00:42:36,929
EXHALES DEEPLY

812
00:42:44,645 --> 00:42:46,063
Help me, Jesus.

813
00:43:01,537 --> 00:43:02,705
Isaiah?

814
00:43:08,585 --> 00:43:11,171
Hey, I'm sorry I'm so late.
I got a plate for you.

815
00:43:11,714 --> 00:43:13,256
Nah, it's cool.

816
00:43:13,257 --> 00:43:15,466
I was with your aunt and a bunch
of women at the salon

817
00:43:15,467 --> 00:43:16,592
and we were praying

818
00:43:16,593 --> 00:43:19,138
and I just completely
lost track of time.

819
00:43:23,600 --> 00:43:24,601
Are you okay?

820
00:43:26,145 --> 00:43:27,229
Yeah. Um...

821
00:43:28,522 --> 00:43:29,606
I was, uh...

822
00:43:31,734 --> 00:43:32,901
I was praying, too.

823
00:43:35,738 --> 00:43:37,448
What were you praying about?

824
00:43:38,907 --> 00:43:39,908
Um...

825
00:43:41,327 --> 00:43:42,536
You know, um...

826
00:43:44,246 --> 00:43:45,956
I've been trying
to figure things out...

827
00:43:47,458 --> 00:43:48,625
by myself...

828
00:43:50,753 --> 00:43:52,546
and now I realize that, uh...

829
00:43:55,466 --> 00:43:56,675
I need Jesus.

830
00:43:58,177 --> 00:44:00,262
You know, to save me and...

831
00:44:01,555 --> 00:44:03,515
Yeah, so I asked Him.

832
00:44:08,687 --> 00:44:09,772
Isaiah.

833
00:44:11,774 --> 00:44:14,276
Oh, Isaiah, I've been
praying about this.

834
00:44:15,778 --> 00:44:17,071
Praise the Lord.

835
00:44:18,697 --> 00:44:20,407
Oh, thank you, Jesus.

836
00:44:21,408 --> 00:44:22,576
Oh, my goodness.

837
00:44:24,661 --> 00:44:26,704
Okay. Oh, my goodness.

838
00:44:26,705 --> 00:44:28,791
I've been looking forward
to this for so long.

839
00:44:29,708 --> 00:44:32,543
- I'm sorry. I just...
- All right. It's cool. Um...

840
00:44:32,544 --> 00:44:33,711
EXHALES

841
00:44:33,712 --> 00:44:36,131
I don't know what took me
so long. You know?

842
00:44:40,260 --> 00:44:42,429
Do you know
what we were praying for?

843
00:44:43,097 --> 00:44:44,223
What?

844
00:44:46,225 --> 00:44:48,227
We were praying for you.

845
00:44:52,022 --> 00:44:54,566
Thanks, Ma. I love you.

846
00:44:56,276 --> 00:44:58,112
I love you so much, baby.

847
00:44:59,613 --> 00:45:01,240
I love you so much.

848
00:45:04,576 --> 00:45:06,578
INAUDIBLE

849
00:45:10,374 --> 00:45:12,376
INAUDIBLE

850
00:45:22,010 --> 00:45:23,220
ISAIAH: Hey.

851
00:45:24,304 --> 00:45:25,931
- GRUNTS ENTHUSIASTICALLY
- Yeah.

852
00:45:26,765 --> 00:45:27,850
LAUGHS

853
00:45:29,101 --> 00:45:30,102
Isaiah.

854
00:45:31,270 --> 00:45:32,895
You are my brother in Christ.

855
00:45:32,896 --> 00:45:35,648
All right, all right,
but there's more, right?

856
00:45:35,649 --> 00:45:37,401
Well, yeah, yeah. Yeah. Yes.

857
00:45:38,402 --> 00:45:39,987
Well, you should be baptized.

858
00:45:41,363 --> 00:45:43,197
And we need to talk
about discipleship.

859
00:45:43,198 --> 00:45:44,740
Yeah, I want to talk about that.

860
00:45:44,741 --> 00:45:48,995
So, I read, like, half
the New Testament yesterday,

861
00:45:48,996 --> 00:45:52,498
and, you know, all of the faith,

862
00:45:52,499 --> 00:45:54,959
miracle stuff
was done by disciples

863
00:45:54,960 --> 00:45:57,253
or people close to Jesus.

864
00:45:57,254 --> 00:46:00,299
So, if I'm doing this,
I want all of it.

865
00:46:01,008 --> 00:46:04,011
Not many people think the way
that you're thinking.

866
00:46:06,013 --> 00:46:09,766
People want salvation,
believing in Jesus.

867
00:46:10,350 --> 00:46:13,145
But very few people want
to follow him into discipleship.

868
00:46:14,313 --> 00:46:15,480
Why?

869
00:46:15,481 --> 00:46:17,274
There's a cost to discipleship.

870
00:46:18,108 --> 00:46:21,028
Jesus says in Luke Chapter 9...

871
00:46:21,195 --> 00:46:24,156
"Whoever wants to be my disciple

872
00:46:24,823 --> 00:46:28,410
"must deny themselves,
take up their cross daily,

873
00:46:29,036 --> 00:46:30,120
"and follow me."

874
00:46:30,829 --> 00:46:33,040
"Take up your cross daily,"
what does that mean?

875
00:46:33,540 --> 00:46:35,167
That means
something's gonna die.

876
00:46:36,710 --> 00:46:40,631
It could be habits,
agenda, goals...

877
00:46:41,298 --> 00:46:44,635
whatever stands in the way
of your relationship with him,

878
00:46:45,219 --> 00:46:46,845
your obedience to him.

879
00:46:47,721 --> 00:46:50,056
Your main priority as a disciple

880
00:46:50,057 --> 00:46:51,808
is not living
to please yourself,

881
00:46:52,643 --> 00:46:54,019
it's living for Him.

882
00:46:54,728 --> 00:46:57,689
Being devoted to Him,
knowing Him.

883
00:46:58,357 --> 00:47:02,027
When I put my faith in Jesus,
I became a Christian.

884
00:47:02,152 --> 00:47:04,654
Then I wanted to grow
as a disciple,

885
00:47:04,655 --> 00:47:07,533
but I had so many other things
in my life.

886
00:47:07,658 --> 00:47:10,661
It's as if
my plate was already full.

887
00:47:12,454 --> 00:47:15,873
But he did something CHUCKLES
that I just didn't expect.

888
00:47:15,874 --> 00:47:17,042
What?

889
00:47:17,167 --> 00:47:18,669
He asked me to give up golf.

890
00:47:19,253 --> 00:47:22,588
Golf? That...
That ain't a bad thing.

891
00:47:22,589 --> 00:47:23,799
No, it's not.

892
00:47:24,341 --> 00:47:25,676
But I loved it.

893
00:47:26,843 --> 00:47:29,346
It had too high of a priority
in my life.

894
00:47:30,472 --> 00:47:32,807
I played every chance I got,

895
00:47:32,808 --> 00:47:35,685
and one day, the Lord
reminded me of my request,

896
00:47:35,686 --> 00:47:37,062
and I realized

897
00:47:37,938 --> 00:47:40,399
I wasn't making any more room
for Him in my life.

898
00:47:41,066 --> 00:47:44,861
So, I gave up
my devotion to golf

899
00:47:45,487 --> 00:47:49,408
and replaced it with more time
with Him and His Word.

900
00:47:50,284 --> 00:47:53,703
I went from playing
two to three times a week

901
00:47:53,704 --> 00:47:55,580
to two to three times a year.

902
00:47:55,581 --> 00:47:56,915
What? CHUCKLES

903
00:47:57,541 --> 00:47:58,709
I'll say this...

904
00:47:59,376 --> 00:48:01,503
there's a cost
to following Jesus,

905
00:48:02,129 --> 00:48:05,048
but it is a hundred percent
worth it.

906
00:48:05,841 --> 00:48:06,925
Hmm.

907
00:48:08,594 --> 00:48:10,011
And He died for me,

908
00:48:10,012 --> 00:48:13,640
so how could He not be
worth everything?

909
00:48:14,391 --> 00:48:15,976
He's worth everything.

910
00:48:17,060 --> 00:48:18,061
You know what?

911
00:48:18,645 --> 00:48:21,397
I want to introduce you
to a small group of men

912
00:48:21,398 --> 00:48:22,899
that mean the world to me.

913
00:48:23,358 --> 00:48:25,276
I think you'd enjoy
meeting them.

914
00:48:25,277 --> 00:48:26,570
Yeah.

915
00:48:29,948 --> 00:48:32,575
Let's do a quick
greeting exercise.

916
00:48:32,576 --> 00:48:34,243
Come on. Stand up here with me.

917
00:48:34,244 --> 00:48:35,911
A greeting exercise?

918
00:48:35,912 --> 00:48:36,997
Come on.

919
00:48:38,123 --> 00:48:39,540
When I met you,

920
00:48:39,541 --> 00:48:42,001
I could barely get you
to look at me in the eye

921
00:48:42,002 --> 00:48:43,629
and give me a handshake.

922
00:48:44,254 --> 00:48:45,631
We're gonna practice that
right now.

923
00:48:45,756 --> 00:48:47,506
- CLEARS THROAT
- Are you for real?

924
00:48:47,507 --> 00:48:49,926
Walk up to me
and introduce yourself.

925
00:48:52,346 --> 00:48:55,181
- Hey, I'm Isaiah.
- BOTH LAUGH

926
00:48:55,182 --> 00:48:57,476
Okay, okay.
I guess that's all right.

927
00:48:58,143 --> 00:48:59,478
Something to remember.

928
00:49:00,771 --> 00:49:02,229
When you meet someone,

929
00:49:02,230 --> 00:49:04,732
you're communicating something
about yourself

930
00:49:04,733 --> 00:49:06,109
and how you see them.

931
00:49:06,943 --> 00:49:09,446
Everyone wants to be valued.

932
00:49:09,988 --> 00:49:12,824
Men, especially,
want to be respected.

933
00:49:14,076 --> 00:49:18,163
So, when you greet someone,
look at them in the eye

934
00:49:18,830 --> 00:49:20,373
as a confident young man.

935
00:49:20,374 --> 00:49:23,168
Not arrogantly, but confidently.

936
00:49:23,669 --> 00:49:26,963
Say your name,
give them a strong handshake,

937
00:49:27,673 --> 00:49:30,175
and then respect them
by learning their name.

938
00:49:30,884 --> 00:49:31,884
Okay.

939
00:49:31,885 --> 00:49:33,928
We're gonna do that
like it's the first time.

940
00:49:33,929 --> 00:49:35,013
Okay.

941
00:49:38,892 --> 00:49:40,935
Hello, sir. I'm Isaiah Wright.

942
00:49:40,936 --> 00:49:43,605
Nice to meet you, Isaiah.
I'm Joshua Moore.

943
00:49:44,231 --> 00:49:45,399
Good to meet you, Mr. Moore.

944
00:49:45,524 --> 00:49:46,649
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

945
00:49:46,650 --> 00:49:50,696
Much better.
Much better. LAUGHS

946
00:49:53,865 --> 00:49:55,533
BEEPING

947
00:49:55,534 --> 00:49:58,662
Wow. You're getting really good
at this, Isaiah.

948
00:49:59,204 --> 00:50:00,454
Well, not as good as you.

949
00:50:00,455 --> 00:50:01,790
You're the fastest one
here, Wanda.

950
00:50:02,791 --> 00:50:03,791
TODD: Okay, Isaiah.

951
00:50:03,792 --> 00:50:06,127
- You're doing pretty good here.
- Thanks, man.

952
00:50:06,128 --> 00:50:07,378
Let's move you to a new section,

953
00:50:07,379 --> 00:50:09,798
get you some more experience.
Follow me.

954
00:50:10,590 --> 00:50:12,466
WANDA: Whoo-hoo! LAUGHS

955
00:50:12,467 --> 00:50:14,552
- SPEAKS SPANISH
- IN ENGLISH Hey, man.

956
00:50:14,553 --> 00:50:15,804
WANDA: Aw!

957
00:50:17,264 --> 00:50:18,348
JOSHUA: Honey, I'm leaving.

958
00:50:19,516 --> 00:50:21,475
Do the guys
know that he's coming?

959
00:50:21,476 --> 00:50:22,602
They do.

960
00:50:23,854 --> 00:50:26,856
- I'm excited for him.
- Me, too. I'm picking him up.

961
00:50:26,857 --> 00:50:28,024
JANELLE: Mm.

962
00:50:30,193 --> 00:50:33,029
- I love you, woman.
- CHUCKLES I love you, too.

963
00:50:36,491 --> 00:50:38,243
I'll be praying for you.

964
00:50:39,536 --> 00:50:41,163
JAZZ MUSIC PLAYING

965
00:50:42,873 --> 00:50:44,875
Hey, you're gonna enjoy tonight.

966
00:50:45,667 --> 00:50:47,710
Good evening, Mr. Moore.
How are you, sir?

967
00:50:47,711 --> 00:50:50,379
- I'm good, Amy. And you?
- Fine, thank you.

968
00:50:50,380 --> 00:50:52,214
Your guests are here.
I can take you back if you like.

969
00:50:52,215 --> 00:50:53,300
That'd be great.

970
00:50:55,927 --> 00:50:57,095
Thank you, Amy.

971
00:50:57,262 --> 00:50:59,514
- Thanks.
- INDISTINCT CHATTER

972
00:50:59,973 --> 00:51:01,683
- There he is.
- JOSHUA: Hey, Tony.

973
00:51:01,808 --> 00:51:03,809
- TONY: That's my guy.
- LAUGHS

974
00:51:03,810 --> 00:51:05,394
- Good to see you, bro.
- Good to see you too, man.

975
00:51:05,395 --> 00:51:07,396
- How you doing?
- I'm just trying to keep up.

976
00:51:07,397 --> 00:51:09,274
- Come on now. Check you out.
- Just trying to keep up.

977
00:51:10,233 --> 00:51:11,650
- What's up, Zay?
- Uncle Tony.

978
00:51:11,651 --> 00:51:15,112
- BOTH LAUGH
- Man, it's good to see you.

979
00:51:15,113 --> 00:51:18,407
Your mother told us about
the big decision that you made.

980
00:51:18,408 --> 00:51:19,618
- And now you're here.
- Yeah.

981
00:51:20,202 --> 00:51:21,495
- Couldn't be more proud.
- Thank you.

982
00:51:21,620 --> 00:51:23,078
You know, my head's been
spinning like crazy,

983
00:51:23,079 --> 00:51:24,205
but I've been
learning a lot, so...

984
00:51:24,206 --> 00:51:26,123
Yeah, well, you're about
to learn a whole lot more.

985
00:51:26,124 --> 00:51:28,001
- I'm excited.
- Yeah, man. Come on.

986
00:51:29,002 --> 00:51:31,921
Well, gentlemen,
this is a good day.

987
00:51:31,922 --> 00:51:33,631
- ALL: Yeah. It is.
- MAN: Yes, sir.

988
00:51:33,632 --> 00:51:36,425
I want to introduce you
to Isaiah Wright,

989
00:51:36,426 --> 00:51:40,222
who just started working
at Moore Fitness, just recently.

990
00:51:40,931 --> 00:51:44,725
And as of a few days ago
is your brother in Christ.

991
00:51:44,726 --> 00:51:46,311
EXCITED CHATTER

992
00:51:50,190 --> 00:51:52,608
Let's go around our circle
and introduce ourselves.

993
00:51:52,609 --> 00:51:55,861
Well, I'm his uncle,
so he already knows me.

994
00:51:55,862 --> 00:51:58,113
But, Isaiah,
this is Trey and Deon.

995
00:51:58,114 --> 00:51:59,490
- Good to see you.
- DEON: Nice to meet you.

996
00:51:59,491 --> 00:52:02,159
And the gentleman standing
next to them is Benjamin.

997
00:52:02,160 --> 00:52:04,078
But we just call him "Coach B."

998
00:52:04,079 --> 00:52:05,871
We coach these guys
on the football field

999
00:52:05,872 --> 00:52:06,956
and we keep up with them

1000
00:52:06,957 --> 00:52:08,124
at the youth group
in church, so...

1001
00:52:08,250 --> 00:52:09,835
Isaiah, nice to meet you, man.

1002
00:52:09,960 --> 00:52:11,252
- Welcome. Welcome.
- ISAIAH: What's up, Coach?

1003
00:52:11,253 --> 00:52:12,920
ALL LAUGH

1004
00:52:12,921 --> 00:52:14,046
Isaiah, I'm Jonathan.

1005
00:52:14,047 --> 00:52:16,590
I'm on staff
at New Hope Community Church,

1006
00:52:16,591 --> 00:52:18,467
and I got my little bro, Levi,
here with me.

1007
00:52:18,468 --> 00:52:19,969
He's one
of our college students.

1008
00:52:19,970 --> 00:52:21,679
- Nice to meet you, man.
- What's up, bro?

1009
00:52:21,680 --> 00:52:25,058
Isaiah, I'm Vaughn,
financial advisor.

1010
00:52:25,183 --> 00:52:26,976
And here I have with me
my son, Jerry.

1011
00:52:26,977 --> 00:52:28,936
- Nice to meet you, bro.
- Yo, that's the money guy now.

1012
00:52:28,937 --> 00:52:31,063
So, if you need anything,
that's where you go.

1013
00:52:31,064 --> 00:52:33,233
- You gotta know him.
- VAUGHN: I got you.

1014
00:52:33,775 --> 00:52:36,277
My name's Bobby
and I'm a family counselor.

1015
00:52:36,278 --> 00:52:37,403
This is Ethan.

1016
00:52:37,404 --> 00:52:39,905
And about two weeks ago,
he asked Jesus into his heart.

1017
00:52:39,906 --> 00:52:41,074
- Yeah.
- Yes, yes.

1018
00:52:42,826 --> 00:52:43,826
And I'm James,

1019
00:52:43,827 --> 00:52:46,495
retired military and now I do
a little bit of real estate,

1020
00:52:46,496 --> 00:52:48,330
but this is my son, KJ.

1021
00:52:48,331 --> 00:52:50,082
And I want to tell you, man,

1022
00:52:50,083 --> 00:52:51,917
thank you for helping
with the food distribution

1023
00:52:51,918 --> 00:52:53,544
last Saturday.

1024
00:52:53,545 --> 00:52:55,421
Brothers, this dude
was working hard.

1025
00:52:55,422 --> 00:52:56,798
So, man, we appreciate you, man.

1026
00:52:56,923 --> 00:52:59,383
That's right. Good stuff,
good stuff. Very true.

1027
00:52:59,384 --> 00:53:01,511
Well, Isaiah,
we are a growing group.

1028
00:53:02,220 --> 00:53:05,473
Each man here has strengths
that he invests in other men.

1029
00:53:05,974 --> 00:53:07,933
We eat together,
we pray together,

1030
00:53:07,934 --> 00:53:09,435
encourage one another,

1031
00:53:09,436 --> 00:53:11,478
and we keep
each other accountable

1032
00:53:11,479 --> 00:53:12,939
as we follow Jesus.

1033
00:53:14,024 --> 00:53:17,110
Isaiah, welcome to The Forge.

INAUDIBLE

1035
00:53:21,948 --> 00:53:23,073
TONY: I'm praying, right?

1036
00:53:23,074 --> 00:53:24,950
I prayed all night,
and I'm thinking,

1037
00:53:24,951 --> 00:53:27,286
"Man, why would God
bring me this far,

1038
00:53:27,287 --> 00:53:30,372
"only to come to a financial gap
that was impossible to cross?"

1039
00:53:30,373 --> 00:53:31,790
- MAN: That's right.
- TONY: So, I'm confused

1040
00:53:31,791 --> 00:53:32,917
but I kept seeking Him.

1041
00:53:32,918 --> 00:53:34,126
TAPS TABLE

1042
00:53:34,127 --> 00:53:36,545
That's when Hebrews 11:6
just jumped off the page

1043
00:53:36,546 --> 00:53:37,880
and punched me in the face.

1044
00:53:37,881 --> 00:53:39,965
- ALL LAUGH
- This is where it says,

1045
00:53:39,966 --> 00:53:41,967
"Without faith, it's impossible
to please God..."

1046
00:53:41,968 --> 00:53:43,052
Yeah. Talk to Him.

1047
00:53:43,053 --> 00:53:44,845
"...because anyone
who comes to Him

1048
00:53:44,846 --> 00:53:46,847
"must believe that He exists

1049
00:53:46,848 --> 00:53:49,099
"and that He rewards those
who earnestly seek Him."

1050
00:53:49,100 --> 00:53:51,645
So, I'm thinking about that,
I'm like, man, I realized,

1051
00:53:51,770 --> 00:53:55,022
sometimes God allows
these gaps on purpose

1052
00:53:55,023 --> 00:53:57,024
because if I could
figure it out for myself,

1053
00:53:57,025 --> 00:53:58,400
you know, I'm taking the credit.

1054
00:53:58,401 --> 00:53:59,902
ALL LAUGHING

1055
00:53:59,903 --> 00:54:01,987
But He will do it in a way
where only He gets the glory.

1056
00:54:01,988 --> 00:54:03,113
- Yeah.
- ALL: Mm-hmm.

1057
00:54:03,114 --> 00:54:05,283
Fellas, if you're earnestly
seeking him,

1058
00:54:06,451 --> 00:54:07,868
then don't be afraid
of the gaps.

1059
00:54:07,869 --> 00:54:09,370
- JONATHAN: Yeah.
- That's good.

1060
00:54:09,371 --> 00:54:10,996
- BOBBY: Right there.
- That'll preach right here.

1061
00:54:10,997 --> 00:54:12,874
That's good stuff,
good stuff, good stuff.

1062
00:54:12,999 --> 00:54:15,376
All right, Bobby,
what has God shown you lately?

1063
00:54:15,377 --> 00:54:17,503
CHUCKLES You're gonna make me
follow that?

1064
00:54:17,504 --> 00:54:19,505
- JOSHUA: Oh, you got to.
- ALL LAUGH

1065
00:54:19,506 --> 00:54:20,589
How long y'all been
meeting like this?

1066
00:54:20,590 --> 00:54:21,674
- BOBBY: You know, I think God...
- Say what?

1067
00:54:21,675 --> 00:54:23,384
How long y'all been
meeting like this?

1068
00:54:23,385 --> 00:54:24,510
Oh, man,

1069
00:54:24,511 --> 00:54:27,681
Joshua discipled each
of the older guys in this room.

1070
00:54:27,806 --> 00:54:30,350
Did it over the last 15 years,
including me several years ago.

1071
00:54:31,017 --> 00:54:32,893
He spends about two years
with each guy,

1072
00:54:32,894 --> 00:54:34,770
you know,
teaching them how to walk,

1073
00:54:34,771 --> 00:54:36,397
walk with the Lord, you know?

1074
00:54:36,398 --> 00:54:37,856
But then he encourages us

1075
00:54:37,857 --> 00:54:40,651
to invest in someone else
to do the same thing.

1076
00:54:40,652 --> 00:54:42,987
So, all the guys
you see in this room,

1077
00:54:42,988 --> 00:54:46,408
we're discipling someone, too,
just like he did us.

1078
00:54:46,950 --> 00:54:48,283
You know,
just helping them to mold

1079
00:54:48,284 --> 00:54:50,119
and shape their faith
and character.

1080
00:54:50,120 --> 00:54:51,912
So, that's why we call it
"The Forge," man.

1081
00:54:51,913 --> 00:54:53,372
It's just a bunch of guys
who come together,

1082
00:54:53,373 --> 00:54:55,374
we grow together,
we eat together.

1083
00:54:55,375 --> 00:54:57,335
We share a meal like this
every two weeks, man.

1084
00:54:58,003 --> 00:54:59,294
It's one of the most
important things

1085

left messages,
texted him, and, um...

1193
01:03:00,568 --> 01:03:02,195
he never responded.

1194
01:03:06,741 --> 01:03:11,496

he cheated on her,

1195
01:03:12,622 --> 01:03:15,416

01:04:24,402 --> 01:04:27,071
He sees everything.

1207
01:04:27,905 --> 01:04:29,782
And He is the perfect judge.

1208
01:04:31,200 --> 01:04:33,911
And he said, "Vengeance is mine,

1209
01:04:34,579 --> 01:04:35,913
"I will repay."

1210
01:04:39,792 --> 01:04:41,127
But I wouldn't let it go.

1211
01:04:42,587 --> 01:04:43,588
So,

1212
01:04:45,381 --> 01:04:47,300
I asked God to help me...

1213
01:04:49,218 --> 01:04:52,221
and then I made the hardest
decision that I've ever made.

1214
01:04:54,432 --> 01:04:55,808
I gave it to God.

1215
01:04:59,103 --> 01:05:00,229
And I forgave.

1216
01:05:01,897 --> 01:05:03,649
Not because I felt like it.

1217
01:05:05,109 --> 01:05:08,446
God has forgiven me of so much.

1218
01:05:09,614 --> 01:05:12,241
Who was I to refuse to forgive?

1219
01:05:15,202 --> 01:05:18,331
Who am I to ignore what Jesus
did for me on the cross?

1220
01:05:19,457 --> 01:05:21,876
So, I'm just
supposed to forgive? Huh?

1221
01:05:23,252 --> 01:05:24,920
If you hang on to it...

1222
01:05:26,255 --> 01:05:27,798
it's gonna poison you.

EXHALES

1224
01:05:31,594 --> 01:05:33,220
When I chose to forgive

1225
01:05:34,347 --> 01:05:36,182
and give it to God to handle...

1226
01:05:38,351 --> 01:05:42,438
it was like a parking brake
was taken off my life.

1227
01:05:43,022 --> 01:05:46,776
And he started
to replace all my pain

1228
01:05:47,568 --> 01:05:48,568
with healing.

1229
01:05:48,569 --> 01:05:50,237
Look, I have no father.

1230
01:05:50,696 --> 01:05:52,281
Yes, you do.

1231
01:05:56,077 --> 01:05:57,827
When you gave your life
to Christ,

1232
01:05:57,828 --> 01:05:59,871
you became right with God.

1233
01:05:59,872 --> 01:06:01,791
And God is not like your daddy.

1234
01:06:03,542 --> 01:06:05,378
God is the perfect father.

1235
01:06:07,004 --> 01:06:08,839
And God loves you, Isaiah.

1236
01:06:10,299 --> 01:06:12,843
He loves you more than you know.

1237
01:06:13,511 --> 01:06:17,056
You can trust him.
He loves you deeply.

1238
01:06:20,810 --> 01:06:22,895
So, what am I supposed to do?

1239
01:06:23,813 --> 01:06:27,316
Trust your perfect
heavenly father...

1240
01:06:28,693 --> 01:06:30,319
with your earthly dad.

1241
01:06:32,196 --> 01:06:33,531
Choose to forgive.

1242
01:06:35,533 --> 01:06:37,702
Not by feelings, by choice.

I was going to be

a disciple of Christ...

1247
01:07:00,850 --> 01:07:04,937
that I used to help me
want to forgive.

1248
01:07:10,234 --> 01:07:11,568
But this is your journal.

1249
01:07:11,569 --> 01:07:13,612
Yes, and it's full

God was showing me.

The gentleman
who took me through

1324
01:12:41,065 --> 01:12:42,691
two years of discipleship

1325
01:12:43,692 --> 01:12:48,112
showed me an example of my need
for more brothers in Christ.

1326
01:12:48,113 --> 01:12:50,741
I'd like to share
that example with you.

Isaiah, step out, please.

1328
01:13:01,543 --> 01:13:03,669
Now, this was shaped

1329
01:13:03,670 --> 01:13:07,716
with intense heat and pressure
in a forge.

1330
01:13:08,801 --> 01:13:10,344
It weighs about 10 pounds.

Take this sword
and hold it out straight.

1332
01:13:22,397 --> 01:13:25,526
The more time we spend

Ephesians 6 tells us

1336
01:13:36,495 --> 01:13:39,122
that the Word of God
is our sword of the Spirit.

1337
01:13:39,123 --> 01:13:41,624
It is our primary weapon.

1338
01:13:41,625 --> 01:13:42,835
Now, at first...

1339
01:13:43,544 --> 01:13:47,588
you'll feel strong and ready,

1340
01:13:47,589 --> 01:13:49,173

that stands in front of you.

1342

But God wants us
to love each other,

1343
01:13:56,306 --> 01:13:59,351
encourage one other,
keep each other accountable.

1344
01:14:00,894 --> 01:14:04,021

that we try to walk it alone,

1347
01:14:10,362 --> 01:14:12,905

- BOBBY: I'm sure it is.

Such is life.

as far as they can
by themselves.

1352
01:14:23,083 --> 01:14:24,917

when we stand together.

take a stand on your own...

1381
01:16:16,113 --> 01:16:18,490
They tell you
about his son, Jalen?

1382
01:16:19,283 --> 01:16:21,743
Oh. Ms. Janelle told me.

1383
01:16:22,953 --> 01:16:24,829
That he was killed
by a drunk driver.

1384
01:16:24,830 --> 01:16:26,039
Hmm.

1385
01:16:27,582 --> 01:16:28,667
Yeah.

1386
01:16:32,796 --> 01:16:33,797
Um...

1387
01:16:34,423 --> 01:16:36,049
I was... I was that driver.

1388
01:16:40,137 --> 01:16:42,472
Yeah. That's how we met.

1389
01:16:46,351 --> 01:16:49,646
About a year after the trial...

1390
01:16:50,897 --> 01:16:52,857
he came to visit me

1391
01:16:52,858 --> 01:16:55,527
with a man
who was discipling him.

1392
01:16:58,363 --> 01:16:59,573
And then...

1393
01:17:02,034 --> 01:17:03,326
that guy just...

1394
01:17:03,327 --> 01:17:04,870
He just kept on coming.

1395
01:17:06,997 --> 01:17:09,583
- You know how he is.
- Yeah.

1396
01:17:13,128 --> 01:17:15,964
Eventually, he led me to Jesus.

1397
01:17:19,259 --> 01:17:20,469
Changed my life.

1398
01:17:25,807 --> 01:17:27,934
I was the first one
he discipled.

1399
01:17:31,772 --> 01:17:33,065
INDISTINCT CHATTER

1400
01:17:43,033 --> 01:17:44,242
DOOR OPENS

1401
01:17:46,703 --> 01:17:48,455
ISAIAH: Hey. You need help?

1402
01:17:48,914 --> 01:17:52,125
No, this is it. Just testing out
some new products for the salon.

1403
01:17:52,918 --> 01:17:54,668
- Did you mow the lawn?
- Oh, yeah.

1404
01:17:54,669 --> 01:17:56,754
I had some time
before the meeting tonight.

1405
01:17:56,755 --> 01:17:58,464
Well, thank you. It looks great.

1406
01:17:58,465 --> 01:18:00,509
Yeah. Did you get
what I sent you?

1407
01:18:01,927 --> 01:18:03,011
Mm-mm.

1408
01:18:06,473 --> 01:18:08,975
I wanted to send you
my first rent payment.

1409
01:18:09,893 --> 01:18:11,936
Isaiah, this is more than
it needs to be.

1410
01:18:11,937 --> 01:18:13,437
No, it's what I wanted to do.

1411
01:18:13,438 --> 01:18:17,818
And I also wanted to ask you
if I can take you to dinner.

1412
01:18:18,902 --> 01:18:21,237
Okay, wait a minute. Hold on.

1413
01:18:21,238 --> 01:18:23,864
My son is helping me
around the house,

1414
01:18:23,865 --> 01:18:24,990
he's paying me rent,

1415
01:18:24,991 --> 01:18:26,867
and you want to take me
on a mama date?

1416
01:18:26,868 --> 01:18:31,455
Yes, ma'am. But I do need
to use your car if that's cool.

1417
01:18:31,456 --> 01:18:33,291
But I'm saving up for my own.

1418
01:18:34,626 --> 01:18:35,835
You know what?

1419
01:18:35,836 --> 01:18:39,506
I would claim you as my son
to anybody, anytime, anyplace.

1420
01:18:40,507 --> 01:18:42,800
All right.
Well, I'll remember that.

1421
01:18:42,801 --> 01:18:45,846
What in the...
What is happening?

1422
01:18:46,430 --> 01:18:48,849
- POP MUSIC PLAYING
- INAUDIBLE

1423
01:20:03,089 --> 01:20:04,340
MUSIC ENDS

1424
01:20:04,341 --> 01:20:06,967
So, I can take
three classes a semester

1425
01:20:06,968 --> 01:20:08,720
and I can still
keep my hours here.

1426
01:20:10,514 --> 01:20:12,306
Bachelor's degree in business?

1427
01:20:12,307 --> 01:20:14,392
Yeah. What do you think?

1428
01:20:15,185 --> 01:20:17,228
I like it. CHUCKLES

1429
01:20:17,229 --> 01:20:18,312
And the cost?

1430
01:20:18,313 --> 01:20:19,647
I'm eligible for one grant,

1431
01:20:19,648 --> 01:20:21,357
but I can get
a partial scholarship

1432
01:20:21,358 --> 01:20:22,441
if I keep my grades up.

1433
01:20:22,442 --> 01:20:26,530
I mean, I can cover the rest,
but I'm ready to get a car.

1434
01:20:27,447 --> 01:20:29,907
Yeah. I'm actually
getting excited about it,

1435
01:20:29,908 --> 01:20:31,243
but I know it's gonna be hard.

1436
01:20:31,952 --> 01:20:33,827
Don't be afraid
of doing hard things

1437
01:20:33,828 --> 01:20:35,455
as long as they're worth doing.

1438
01:20:36,581 --> 01:20:37,915
Honor the Lord.

1439
01:20:37,916 --> 01:20:39,709
- See what He does.
- Yeah.

1440
01:20:40,252 --> 01:20:41,460
Well, speaking of hard things...

1441
01:20:41,461 --> 01:20:44,129
I... I've been
praying for my dad

1442
01:20:44,130 --> 01:20:45,881
and I decided
to write him a letter.

1443
01:20:45,882 --> 01:20:47,299
And I mailed it off
to the company

1444
01:20:47,300 --> 01:20:48,552
he was driving for, so...

1445
01:20:49,094 --> 01:20:50,511
I hope he gets it.

1446
01:20:50,512 --> 01:20:52,054
But I said everything
I needed to say.

1447
01:20:52,055 --> 01:20:53,932
And if he doesn't respond?

1448
01:20:54,599 --> 01:20:57,351
I mean, I've already
given it to the Lord.

1449
01:20:57,352 --> 01:20:59,478
And I'm becoming more settled
with the fact that,

1450
01:20:59,479 --> 01:21:02,523
you know, God is the father
I need the most.

1451
01:21:02,524 --> 01:21:04,067
But thought I'd give it a try,
you know?

1452
01:21:05,277 --> 01:21:06,778
You've done well, Isaiah.

1453
01:21:07,571 --> 01:21:08,571
No matter what happens,

1454
01:21:08,572 --> 01:21:10,072
I know the Lord's
going to bless you.

1455
01:21:10,073 --> 01:21:11,240
KNOCK ON DOOR

1456
01:21:11,241 --> 01:21:13,994
Sorry to interrupt, sir,
but they now have both.

1457
01:21:14,786 --> 01:21:16,745
Slayer Sports got both accounts?

1458
01:21:16,746 --> 01:21:19,331
Yes, sir. Again, it's two
of our smaller accounts,

1459
01:21:19,332 --> 01:21:21,001
but they are moving fast.

1460
01:21:21,793 --> 01:21:23,502
We can keep the mission products
going for now.

1461
01:21:23,503 --> 01:21:25,212
But we can't lose
another account.

1462
01:21:25,213 --> 01:21:27,465
I think they're gonna go after
GymFit or HighStride.

1463
01:21:31,094 --> 01:21:33,388
See if you can get a meeting
with our top three accounts.

1464
01:21:34,389 --> 01:21:36,057
I'll fly out and talk to them.

1465
01:21:36,600 --> 01:21:37,809
I'll do it.

1466
01:21:44,983 --> 01:21:46,400
JOSHUA: I want to do
something tonight

1467
01:21:46,401 --> 01:21:48,193
that the older men and I
have been talking about

1468
01:21:48,194 --> 01:21:49,571
for a few weeks now.

1469
01:21:51,406 --> 01:21:52,740
You younger men

1470
01:21:52,741 --> 01:21:55,993
have been walking through
your discipleship so well.

1471
01:21:55,994 --> 01:21:58,329
And we want to affirm
each and every one of you

1472
01:21:58,330 --> 01:21:59,956
at times in your journey.

1473
01:22:00,915 --> 01:22:03,543
Tonight, I want to start...

1474
01:22:04,919 --> 01:22:05,920
with Isaiah.

1475
01:22:06,755 --> 01:22:08,047
MAN 1: All right.

1476
01:22:08,048 --> 01:22:09,633
- Would you step forward?
- MAN 2: All right.

1477
01:22:14,220 --> 01:22:16,806
I have some things
I want to say to you.

1478
01:22:18,475 --> 01:22:21,353
I have known you now
for a year...

1479
01:22:21,978 --> 01:22:26,732
and I have watched you grow
and mature in so many ways.

1480
01:22:26,733 --> 01:22:29,944
You have grown in character,

1481
01:22:30,695 --> 01:22:32,280
in responsibility,

1482
01:22:33,073 --> 01:22:34,157
in your faith,

1483
01:22:34,741 --> 01:22:36,992
even in the way
you carry yourself.

1484
01:22:36,993 --> 01:22:38,494
- JAMES: Yeah. Yeah.
- JOSHUA LAUGHS

1485
01:22:38,495 --> 01:22:41,665
In fact, gentlemen,
if I may be blunt...

1486
01:22:44,250 --> 01:22:45,918
a man stands in front of me.

1487
01:22:45,919 --> 01:22:47,420
ALL APPLAUDING

1488
01:22:51,091 --> 01:22:56,554
Isaiah has embraced Jesus Christ
as his Lord and Savior.

1489
01:22:58,598 --> 01:23:01,476
He has worked hard to learn

1490
01:23:02,227 --> 01:23:05,146
and to apply biblical principles
to his life.

1491
01:23:05,897 --> 01:23:09,066
He has fought
to forgive past hurts

1492
01:23:09,067 --> 01:23:11,193
and surrender them to the Lord.

1493
01:23:11,194 --> 01:23:16,199
I have watched him
walk as a man.

1494
01:23:17,450 --> 01:23:18,660
A godly man.

1495
01:23:20,954 --> 01:23:23,915
So, Isaiah,
I want to bless you...

1496
01:23:25,625 --> 01:23:26,876
in the name of the Lord.

1497
01:23:29,921 --> 01:23:31,214
I bless you...

1498
01:23:33,216 --> 01:23:34,551
with respect,

1499
01:23:35,635 --> 01:23:38,138
love and friendship

1500
01:23:38,972 --> 01:23:40,724
as a brother in Christ.

1501
01:23:41,850 --> 01:23:45,019
And I call you a strong,

1502
01:23:45,937 --> 01:23:48,355
faith-filled man of wisdom

1503
01:23:48,356 --> 01:23:50,024
with a bold future.

1504
01:23:51,735 --> 01:23:53,069
From today forward,

1505
01:23:54,404 --> 01:23:58,783
may God's hand of goodness
rest upon your life.

1506
01:23:59,617 --> 01:24:01,745
May you experience His love...

1507
01:24:03,037 --> 01:24:06,582
His forgiveness, His power,

1508
01:24:06,583 --> 01:24:08,251
and His provision.

1509
01:24:10,253 --> 01:24:13,256
May His blessings cover you...

1510
01:24:14,340 --> 01:24:16,342
because you put
your faith in Him.

1511
01:24:17,969 --> 01:24:20,680
And may you
now walk in victory...

1512
01:24:23,141 --> 01:24:24,350
and never in defeat.

1513
01:24:26,561 --> 01:24:28,021
SNIFFLES

1514
01:24:28,855 --> 01:24:30,064
I love you.

1515
01:24:33,276 --> 01:24:34,903
And I am proud of you.

1516
01:24:40,450 --> 01:24:42,869
In the name of Jesus,
our Lord and Savior.

1517
01:24:47,290 --> 01:24:50,042
Men of The Forge, join me

1518
01:24:50,043 --> 01:24:51,628
and let's pray over him.

1519
01:24:58,092 --> 01:25:00,637
- Father God.
- JAMES: Yes. Yes.

1520
01:25:01,846 --> 01:25:03,514
May you bless Isaiah,

1521
01:25:03,515 --> 01:25:05,266
- our brother in Christ.
- JAMES: Yes.

1522
01:25:06,142 --> 01:25:07,976
I ask you to lead him...

1523
01:25:07,977 --> 01:25:09,061
Yes.

1524
01:25:09,062 --> 01:25:10,647
...to guard him,

1525
01:25:11,981 --> 01:25:13,858
fill him with wisdom,

1526
01:25:14,734 --> 01:25:18,279
- discernment as he follows you.
- JAMES: Yes. Yes.

1527
01:25:19,322 --> 01:25:23,242
Place your hand
upon his life and his heart.

1528
01:25:23,243 --> 01:25:24,327
Yes, Lord.

1529
01:25:24,953 --> 01:25:27,788
Bless him when he comes in

1530
01:25:27,789 --> 01:25:30,500
- and bless him when he goes out.
- MEN: Yes.

1531
01:25:31,417 --> 01:25:34,045
Father, bless everything
that he puts his hand to.

1532
01:25:35,171 --> 01:25:37,090
I ask you to protect him

1533
01:25:38,216 --> 01:25:41,344
from anything that would
pull him away from you.

1534
01:25:42,303 --> 01:25:44,847
Put him on the path

1535
01:25:44,848 --> 01:25:48,433
that you have chosen for him.

1536
01:25:48,434 --> 01:25:49,518
MEN: Yes, Lord.

1537
01:25:49,519 --> 01:25:52,105
And may he be
a blessing to others

1538
01:25:53,189 --> 01:25:54,690
all the days of his life.

1539
01:25:54,691 --> 01:25:55,942
JAMES: Yes.

1540
01:25:56,860 --> 01:26:00,405
And I ask this and receive it...

1541
01:26:01,781 --> 01:26:04,491
in the name of our Lord
and Savior, Jesus Christ.

1542
01:26:04,492 --> 01:26:05,577
JAMES: Yes.

1543
01:26:07,287 --> 01:26:09,038
- Amen.
- ALL: Amen.

1544
01:26:11,916 --> 01:26:13,001
JOSHUA: Oh.

1545
01:26:16,921 --> 01:26:18,047
COACH B: Yeah.

1546
01:26:18,798 --> 01:26:21,676
- There you go.
- INDISTINCT CHATTER

1547
01:26:22,927 --> 01:26:25,138
- Thank you, brother.
- Congratulations.

1548
01:26:28,141 --> 01:26:30,268
I've... I've never felt
like this.

1549
01:26:31,102 --> 01:26:32,937
So it was a good day, huh?

1550
01:26:34,022 --> 01:26:35,189
Yeah. CHUCKLES

1551
01:26:35,940 --> 01:26:37,358
Yeah. It was.

1552
01:26:37,817 --> 01:26:40,695
Well, baby, the day ain't over.

1553
01:26:43,364 --> 01:26:44,574
What do you mean?

1554
01:26:46,451 --> 01:26:48,870
Okay. What is this?

1555
01:26:49,370 --> 01:26:50,996
I just got something to show ya.

1556
01:26:50,997 --> 01:26:53,708
Can you lift up
the garage door, please?

1557
01:27:33,873 --> 01:27:34,874
This...

1558
01:27:36,000 --> 01:27:37,752
This is not my car.

1559
01:27:39,629 --> 01:27:41,047
This is your car.

1560
01:27:57,647 --> 01:27:58,731
How'd you do this?

1561
01:28:00,858 --> 01:28:03,945
Um, Joshua, he knows a man
who does this.

1562
01:28:04,821 --> 01:28:07,240
And... And...

1563
01:28:08,324 --> 01:28:11,828
there's another young man I know
who's been paying me rent

1564
01:28:12,120 --> 01:28:13,579
for a little while now.

1565
01:28:14,080 --> 01:28:16,415
So, you know,
I've had some extra income

1566
01:28:16,416 --> 01:28:18,042
and I've been saving it.

1567
01:28:21,504 --> 01:28:22,839
SNIFFLES

1568
01:28:26,300 --> 01:28:27,677
BOTH SOBBING

1569
01:28:29,971 --> 01:28:31,139
Thank you, Lord.

1570
01:28:33,599 --> 01:28:34,809
EXHALES

1571
01:28:37,228 --> 01:28:39,856
Thank you, Lord, for my son.

1572
01:28:44,485 --> 01:28:45,485
I thank you, Father,

1573
01:28:45,486 --> 01:28:48,406
'cause I... I see
what you're doing in his life.

1574
01:28:52,702 --> 01:28:54,120
Thank you, Lord.

1575
01:28:57,832 --> 01:28:59,333
Thank you, Father.

1576
01:29:26,277 --> 01:29:27,277
ISAIAH: Yo.

1577
01:29:27,278 --> 01:29:28,696
Zay, is this your car?

1578
01:29:29,280 --> 01:29:30,573
Let's go, Zay!

1579
01:29:30,698 --> 01:29:32,824
Let's go, Zay! Let's go.

1580
01:29:32,825 --> 01:29:34,410
Dang, she's beautiful!

1581
01:29:34,994 --> 01:29:36,079
What?

1582
01:29:44,879 --> 01:29:47,298
- Thank you.
- Thank you! See you then!

1583
01:29:48,883 --> 01:29:51,843
- Hey, baby. You ready?
- Ah. Just about to come get you.

1584
01:29:51,844 --> 01:29:54,054
Our flight leaves in 90 minutes
for Dallas.

1585
01:29:54,055 --> 01:29:55,680
- Okay.
- Joshua, Janelle.

1586
01:29:55,681 --> 01:29:57,517
I know you're on your way
to meet with HighStride.

1587
01:29:57,642 --> 01:29:58,725
I just need a minute.

1588
01:29:58,726 --> 01:30:00,519
I just learned
that Greyson Lance,

1589
01:30:00,520 --> 01:30:02,020
the new president of GymFit,

1590
01:30:02,021 --> 01:30:05,023
is having a meeting
with Slayer Sports this morning.

1591
01:30:05,024 --> 01:30:06,274
And they're trying
to lure him over.

1592
01:30:06,275 --> 01:30:07,984
Is he not responding to us?

1593
01:30:07,985 --> 01:30:09,194
Well, we've reached out
several times,

1594
01:30:09,195 --> 01:30:10,530
just without a relationship.

1595
01:30:10,655 --> 01:30:12,739
He's just seeing
what's out there.

1596
01:30:12,740 --> 01:30:17,161
Okay, look, we'll fly to GymFit
after we meet with HighStride.

1597
01:30:17,328 --> 01:30:19,454
- Okay.
- I don't want to seem desperate.

1598
01:30:19,455 --> 01:30:20,789
We need to talk face-to-face.

1599
01:30:20,790 --> 01:30:21,873
I was hoping you'd say that.

1600
01:30:21,874 --> 01:30:23,333
I will let him know
you're coming.

1601
01:30:23,334 --> 01:30:24,751
- Thanks again, Emmett.
- EMMETT: Yeah.

1602
01:30:24,752 --> 01:30:26,962
We better pray
all the way there.

1603
01:30:26,963 --> 01:30:28,131
JOSHUA: Yeah.

1604
01:30:31,676 --> 01:30:33,845
- Thanks. Appreciate it.
- Have a safe one.

1605
01:30:56,075 --> 01:30:57,076
CAR DOOR CLOSES

1606
01:31:05,418 --> 01:31:07,587
Oh. Hello. How can I help you?

1607
01:31:07,712 --> 01:31:10,505
- Hey, how are you?
- I'm fine. Thank you.

1608
01:31:10,506 --> 01:31:12,300
Is there something
I can help you with?

1609
01:31:13,092 --> 01:31:14,301
Uh...

1610
01:31:14,302 --> 01:31:18,430
- By chance, is your father here?
- He is. Um...

1611
01:31:18,431 --> 01:31:19,806
Do you need to speak with him?

1612
01:31:19,807 --> 01:31:22,893
Yes, please, if it's not
an inconvenience, of course.

1613
01:31:22,894 --> 01:31:25,438
Okay. Sure.
Just give me a second.

1614
01:31:27,565 --> 01:31:28,649
Thank you.

1615
01:31:35,990 --> 01:31:38,992
- MAN: Hello, sir.
- Hi, I'm Isaiah Wright.

1616
01:31:38,993 --> 01:31:40,869
Tim Watson.
Pleasure to meet you.

1617
01:31:40,870 --> 01:31:41,954
What can I do for you?

1618
01:31:42,955 --> 01:31:47,043
Well, uh, I wanted to speak
with you for a moment because

1619
01:31:48,044 --> 01:31:49,712
I believe I owe you
an apology, sir.

1620
01:31:50,504 --> 01:31:52,881
- An apology?
- Yes, sir.

1621
01:31:52,882 --> 01:31:57,219
I was, you know,
very disrespectful to you

1622
01:31:57,220 --> 01:31:58,304
and your daughter and...

1623
01:31:59,555 --> 01:32:00,973
I'm very, very sorry.

1624
01:32:03,559 --> 01:32:04,726
CHUCKLES

1625
01:32:04,727 --> 01:32:08,021
Uh, I'm sorry, son.
I don't believe we've ever met.

1626
01:32:08,022 --> 01:32:10,233
- So...
- ISAIAH: Yeah, we have.

1627
01:32:11,025 --> 01:32:13,068
You know, about a year ago,
I came here,

1628
01:32:13,069 --> 01:32:14,904
but not to buy coffee and...

1629
01:32:15,905 --> 01:32:17,322
you asked me to leave.

1630
01:32:17,323 --> 01:32:19,075
You know, I said some things

1631
01:32:20,660 --> 01:32:22,161
that, you know,
I shouldn't have. And...

1632
01:32:23,162 --> 01:32:25,957
I apologize.
I mean, to you both. And...

1633
01:32:26,749 --> 01:32:29,377
I just hope you can find it
in your heart to forgive me.

1634
01:32:34,632 --> 01:32:35,675
Hmm.

1635
01:32:38,552 --> 01:32:41,180
- You are not the same young man.
- LAUGHS

1636
01:32:42,098 --> 01:32:44,267
No, sir, I'm definitely not.

1637
01:32:46,269 --> 01:32:47,352
I can respect the fact

1638
01:32:47,353 --> 01:32:49,272
that you've come here
to do this, Isaiah.

1639
01:32:51,190 --> 01:32:54,235
And, yes. I can forgive you.

1640
01:32:55,987 --> 01:32:58,197
Well, thank you, sir.
That, um...

1641
01:32:59,448 --> 01:33:00,825
That means a lot.

1642
01:33:03,619 --> 01:33:05,704
I appreciate you for taking
the time to talk with me.

1643
01:33:05,705 --> 01:33:07,290
- You are certainly welcome.
- Yeah.

1644
01:33:07,915 --> 01:33:08,916
Take care.

1645
01:33:16,090 --> 01:33:19,468
Well, that's not somethin'
you see every day.

1646
01:33:20,886 --> 01:33:22,513
No, it certainly is not.

1647
01:33:24,849 --> 01:33:25,849
JOSHUA: Are you sure?

1648
01:33:25,850 --> 01:33:27,684
EMMETT: And he's opening
the door to get the account

1649
01:33:27,685 --> 01:33:29,520
based on who can fill the order.

1650
01:33:29,645 --> 01:33:31,354
Apparently,
Slayer Sports is saying

1651
01:33:31,355 --> 01:33:33,024
they can have it ready
by noon tomorrow.

1652
01:33:33,149 --> 01:33:35,525
Are their products
even the same quality?

1653
01:33:35,526 --> 01:33:37,944
Well, Greyson Lance says
they consider them equal.

1654
01:33:37,945 --> 01:33:39,612
Slayer has matched our prices

1655
01:33:39,613 --> 01:33:41,406
and is saying
they can deliver them faster.

1656
01:33:41,407 --> 01:33:43,742
So Mr. Lance has asked
for these 3,000 units

1657
01:33:43,743 --> 01:33:46,369
as a demonstration
of who can provide them first.

1658
01:33:46,370 --> 01:33:49,247
Send me his number.
I gotta talk to this guy.

1659
01:33:49,248 --> 01:33:50,457
Please.

1660
01:33:50,458 --> 01:33:53,084
Losing GymFit means
closing the mission account

1661
01:33:53,085 --> 01:33:55,045
or cutting a third of our crew.

1662
01:33:55,046 --> 01:33:57,173
You don't want to
have to pick your poison.

1663
01:33:58,132 --> 01:34:00,509
- I'm sending his number.
- Thanks, Emmett.

1664
01:34:01,344 --> 01:34:03,929
Could we even
fill an order that fast?

1665
01:34:04,388 --> 01:34:06,848
Our crew just worked
an eight-hour shift.

1666
01:34:06,849 --> 01:34:08,976
They'd have to work
another 16 hours or more.

1667
01:34:12,521 --> 01:34:14,357
Oh, God, show me what to do.

1668
01:34:16,442 --> 01:34:18,276
- CARLOS: Crushed it today, man.
- $20 for it.

1669
01:34:18,277 --> 01:34:19,486
- TODD: Are you kidding?
- Yeah.

1670
01:34:19,487 --> 01:34:20,945
TODD: Why do they
have to have it tomorrow?

1671
01:34:20,946 --> 01:34:22,656
EMMETT: It's not that
they have to have it tomorrow.

1672
01:34:22,782 --> 01:34:24,574
They're opening the door
to whoever can demonstrate

1673
01:34:24,575 --> 01:34:26,701
that they can get the job done
on short notice.

1674
01:34:26,702 --> 01:34:28,036
So what are we supposed to do?

1675
01:34:28,037 --> 01:34:29,329
I mean, they're notifying us

1676
01:34:29,330 --> 01:34:30,747
as we're shutting down
for the weekend.

1677
01:34:30,748 --> 01:34:32,874
EMMETT: I'm just saying that
that is a strategic move.

1678
01:34:32,875 --> 01:34:35,293
That is a $4.5 million account.

1679
01:34:35,294 --> 01:34:36,420
- What's up?
- We...

1680
01:34:37,338 --> 01:34:39,881
Our top account, GymFit,
they have a new president

1681
01:34:39,882 --> 01:34:42,050
and our five-year agreement
with them is up this month.

1682
01:34:42,051 --> 01:34:44,095
Now another company
is saying that they can deliver

1683
01:34:44,220 --> 01:34:46,012
comparable fitness products
and faster.

1684
01:34:46,013 --> 01:34:50,850
So, GymFit's president
is requesting a 3,000-unit order

1685
01:34:50,851 --> 01:34:52,936
to whoever can meet it,
as a test.

1686
01:34:52,937 --> 01:34:55,355
- DIEGO: Who's the other company?
- EMMETT: Slayer Sports.

1687
01:34:55,356 --> 01:34:56,606
They want our account

1688
01:34:56,607 --> 01:34:58,108
and they told GymFit
that they could have the order

1689
01:34:58,109 --> 01:34:59,651
ready by noon tomorrow.

1690
01:34:59,652 --> 01:35:01,653
And when I think about it,
we're further away,

1691
01:35:01,654 --> 01:35:03,238
so if we wanted to beat them,

1692
01:35:03,239 --> 01:35:04,364
we would have to have
the order ready

1693
01:35:04,365 --> 01:35:05,616
over two hours earlier, man.

1694
01:35:05,741 --> 01:35:07,283
It was... It was a slick move.

1695
01:35:07,284 --> 01:35:09,494
Yeah, that's real slick.
And there's no way, man.

1696
01:35:09,495 --> 01:35:11,663
No, wait. Do we have
the products they want?

1697
01:35:11,664 --> 01:35:13,373
Yes, but that's not the problem.

1698
01:35:13,374 --> 01:35:15,917
It would take 24 people two days
to fill that order.

1699
01:35:15,918 --> 01:35:18,670
- If they worked normal shifts.
- EMMETT: Mm.

1700
01:35:18,671 --> 01:35:21,131
Bro, we just got off
an eight-hour shift.

1701
01:35:21,132 --> 01:35:23,216
But if we lose that much income,

1702
01:35:23,217 --> 01:35:25,885
it's gonna impact all of us.

1703
01:35:25,886 --> 01:35:27,638
And it can shut down
the mission account, right?

1704
01:35:28,097 --> 01:35:29,472
Yes.

1705
01:35:29,473 --> 01:35:31,391
So listen. If Slayer
wants to make that move,

1706
01:35:31,392 --> 01:35:33,685
we outplay 'em.
We go all night if we have to

1707
01:35:33,686 --> 01:35:35,437
and have the orders
ready by morning.

1708
01:35:35,438 --> 01:35:37,897
Whoa, whoa. Isaiah, all night?
We only got six of us.

1709
01:35:37,898 --> 01:35:38,982
Seven, including Emmett.

1710
01:35:38,983 --> 01:35:40,650
Wait. You're not asking me

1711
01:35:40,651 --> 01:35:42,944
to work another 16 hours,
are you?

1712
01:35:42,945 --> 01:35:45,865
I'm saying I'm willing
to go the second mile.

1713
01:35:45,990 --> 01:35:47,532
We can't just walk out
and do nothing.

1714
01:35:47,533 --> 01:35:48,658
But there's no guarantee

1715
01:35:48,659 --> 01:35:50,243
that we could fill that order
by morning.

1716
01:35:50,244 --> 01:35:51,327
And if Slayer beats us,

1717
01:35:51,328 --> 01:35:52,620
we will have stayed up
all night long,

1718
01:35:52,621 --> 01:35:54,330
nearly killed ourselves
for nothing.

1719
01:35:54,331 --> 01:35:56,958
Look, then let me lead.
I'll take the blame.

1720
01:35:56,959 --> 01:36:00,129
And you can tell Mr. Moore
it was all my idea.

1721
01:36:08,554 --> 01:36:09,555
I'm in.

1722
01:36:10,389 --> 01:36:11,515
Dude, are you serious?

1723
01:36:12,766 --> 01:36:15,643
Joshua Moore is the best boss
I've ever had.

1724
01:36:15,644 --> 01:36:18,313
He's helped too many people
for me to walk away.

1725
01:36:18,314 --> 01:36:19,398
DIEGO: I agree.

1726
01:36:21,358 --> 01:36:22,443
I'll do it, too.

1727
01:36:23,652 --> 01:36:24,653
Okay.

1728
01:36:27,364 --> 01:36:28,365
Okay.

1729
01:36:29,033 --> 01:36:32,952
Well, if we're all in,
I won't be the one to walk out.

1730
01:36:32,953 --> 01:36:35,163
But if we're going
for that knockout punch,

1731
01:36:35,164 --> 01:36:36,373
we better connect.

1732
01:36:37,374 --> 01:36:38,375
Wanda?

1733
01:36:39,543 --> 01:36:41,045
You're really doing this?

1734
01:36:41,962 --> 01:36:43,171

1735

Hey, Wanda. We need you.

1736
01:36:44,798 --> 01:36:47,551
This, it can't happen
without you.

1737

What do you need?

1744
01:37:12,284 --> 01:37:13,868
I need the detailed
product order.

Hey, Todd, we also need storage
robots on the second floor!

1748
01:37:27,675 --> 01:37:28,800
I can't control those.

1749
01:37:28,801 --> 01:37:30,051
I can only program
the floor carts.

1750
01:37:30,052 --> 01:37:31,135
We'll need the engineer
for those.

1751
01:37:31,136 --> 01:37:33,096
Okay, Isaiah, think.
Okay, think.

1753
01:37:35,558 --> 01:37:37,767
Wait, wait, wait. When do you
have to have this done?

1754

ISAIAH: By morning.
We gotta beat another company

1755
01:37:39,812 --> 01:37:42,355
to save our top account
and the mission account.

1756
01:37:42,356 --> 01:37:43,523
But we gotta figure out a way

1757
01:37:43,524 --> 01:37:45,900
to get the storage robots
working, so just pray for us.

1758

I understand.
I'll call you soon.

establish himself

I don't want to
lay off anybody either.

1776
01:38:46,837 --> 01:38:49,340
That's just too many hours
to ask our crew to work.

1777
01:38:50,758 --> 01:38:52,133
I need to call Emmett.

1778

Joshua, I just pulled up
the security cameras

And it looks like they're trying
to fill this order.

1783
01:39:12,905 --> 01:39:15,782
To do 3,000, they're gonna
need the storage bots.

Uh, see if you can
reach out to Cody.

I'm sorry to call you so late,

1799
01:39:49,608 --> 01:39:51,275
but we have
a bit of a situation.

01:39:51,276 --> 01:39:54,238
Can you control the storage
robots from where you are?

Uh... The storage?
Yes. Yes, I can!

Wonderful. Would it be possible
to get your help?

1803

One of our competitors

1804
01:40:03,539 --> 01:40:05,957
is trying to take away
our largest account,

1805
01:40:05,958 --> 01:40:08,418
and we have a team at
the factory trying to stop them.

1806
01:40:08,419 --> 01:40:10,294
But we need those robots.

1807
01:40:10,295 --> 01:40:13,464
Well, they're undergoing
a firmware update currently,

1808
01:40:13,465 --> 01:40:14,882
and I don't have
the order information,

1809

so I don't know
how I would do that.

I can tell you
the number of products

1811

Okay. I can
pull the program up now,

1814
01:40:23,600 --> 01:40:25,602
but I'm gonna have to access
the robots one at a time.

1815
01:40:26,145 --> 01:40:29,148
We'll take it. And we need
to run 'em at full speed.

Um... Sorry, we've never
done that before.

for 15 units.

1892
01:44:29,304 --> 01:44:30,763
Cody, that's 2,000.

1893
01:44:30,764 --> 01:44:32,432
JANELLE: Cody, you still good?

1894
01:44:32,933 --> 01:44:34,558
Yeah. I'm here.

1895
01:44:34,559 --> 01:44:36,435
My fingers
are running a marathon,

1896
01:44:36,436 --> 01:44:38,270
but I want to cross
the finish line.

1897
01:44:38,271 --> 01:44:40,524
Hey! That's 2,000.

1898
01:44:41,775 --> 01:44:43,109
Feels like 10,000!

1899
01:44:43,110 --> 01:44:44,569
ISAIAH: Hey.

1900
01:44:45,195 --> 01:44:46,487
We're doing it.

1901
01:44:46,488 --> 01:44:48,155
We've worked faster than anyone

1902
01:44:48,156 --> 01:44:50,700
and we're almost
at the finish line,

1903
01:44:50,701 --> 01:44:52,034
so let's stay in it.

1904
01:44:52,035 --> 01:44:53,119
And remember,

1905
01:44:53,120 --> 01:44:55,205
it's not just business
we're keeping.

1906
01:44:55,330 --> 01:44:56,580
It's every missionary

1907
01:44:56,581 --> 01:44:58,833
and ministry team
that uses water filters,

1908
01:44:58,834 --> 01:45:01,836
solar panels, and lanterns
that this company provides.

1909
01:45:01,837 --> 01:45:02,920
That's right.

1910
01:45:02,921 --> 01:45:05,506
And we have to keep that
available, all right?

1911
01:45:05,507 --> 01:45:07,509
And if Mr. Moore could see us...

1912
01:45:08,593 --> 01:45:09,803
he'd be so proud.

1913
01:45:09,928 --> 01:45:11,346
He can see you.

1914
01:45:12,222 --> 01:45:14,140
He's been watching you
for the past 10 hours

1915
01:45:14,141 --> 01:45:15,934
from Dallas
over the security cameras.

1916
01:45:16,560 --> 01:45:19,103
And they've been working
with Cody this whole time

1917
01:45:19,104 --> 01:45:20,438
to keep
the storage robots running.

1918
01:45:20,439 --> 01:45:22,231
So that's how
they been doing that?

1919
01:45:22,232 --> 01:45:23,566
He texted me earlier.

1920
01:45:23,567 --> 01:45:25,944
He said, "I've never been
so proud of this crew.

1921
01:45:26,486 --> 01:45:29,321
"They've gone above and beyond
anything I could have asked,

1922
01:45:29,322 --> 01:45:31,032
"and I will never forget it."

1923
01:45:31,033 --> 01:45:33,451
Look, we gotta push this thing
in the end zone, all right?

1924
01:45:33,452 --> 01:45:35,746
- We're not stopping.
- DIEGO: Hey, Mr. Isaiah.

1925
01:45:36,621 --> 01:45:38,623
My body is cansado,

1926
01:45:39,499 --> 01:45:40,625
but my heart is ready.

1927
01:45:41,293 --> 01:45:43,628
Give me caffeine
and I'm with you.

1928
01:45:44,171 --> 01:45:45,671
Hey, Wanda, what do you need?

1929
01:45:45,672 --> 01:45:48,800
I got enough caffeine in me
to go until next Tuesday, so...

1930
01:45:49,676 --> 01:45:52,094
- And Todd?
- Oh, this is beyond crazy.

1931
01:45:52,095 --> 01:45:54,389
- How are we gonna stop now, huh?
- Curtis?

1932
01:45:55,849 --> 01:45:57,976
Oh, I'm gonna sleep
for about two days after this.

1933
01:45:59,102 --> 01:46:00,103
But until then...

1934
01:46:01,521 --> 01:46:02,606
let's roll.

1935
01:46:03,273 --> 01:46:05,650
INSPIRATIONAL MUSIC PLAYING

1936
01:46:10,322 --> 01:46:12,157
Hey, you guys are crushing it!

1937
01:46:21,833 --> 01:46:23,210
CELL PHONE PINGS

1938
01:46:26,630 --> 01:46:29,382
Hey, Isaiah! The trucks
will be here in 30 minutes!

1939
01:46:30,425 --> 01:46:32,636
Yo, we got 30 minutes.
Finish strong. Finish strong!

1940
01:46:37,849 --> 01:46:41,018
Bot 8 to port 12
for seven units.

1941
01:46:41,019 --> 01:46:42,436
And that's it.

1942
01:46:42,437 --> 01:46:44,356
The last 60 orders
are on the conveyer belt.

1943
01:46:45,065 --> 01:46:47,483
They have to seal, label,
and stack them.

1944
01:46:47,484 --> 01:46:49,443
Cody, it's up to them now.

1945
01:46:49,444 --> 01:46:52,155
I can't... I can't go to bed
until I know we've made it.

1946
01:46:55,492 --> 01:46:56,827
BEEPING

1947
01:46:58,912 --> 01:46:59,912
All right.

1948
01:46:59,913 --> 01:47:02,332
- How'd you do that so fast?
- Too many video games.

1949
01:47:02,916 --> 01:47:04,834
Isaiah, the trucks
are almost here.

1950
01:47:04,835 --> 01:47:06,794
Joshua wants you
to greet the drivers.

1951
01:47:06,795 --> 01:47:08,839
I have a jacket in my office
whenever you're ready.

1952
01:47:09,631 --> 01:47:11,091
Isaiah, go. We got this.

1953
01:47:16,179 --> 01:47:19,349
- Yo. Is that it?
- That's it! We're done!

1954
01:47:19,975 --> 01:47:22,685
Hey, it's 8:58!
We got two minutes to spare!

1955
01:47:22,686 --> 01:47:24,062
- Let's go!
- TODD: We did it!

1956
01:47:24,813 --> 01:47:27,439
Look at them, Janelle.
Look at our team.

1957
01:47:27,440 --> 01:47:29,609
Oh, God! Thank you, Jesus!

1958
01:47:30,443 --> 01:47:32,778
Oh, God. Cody, we made it!

1959
01:47:32,779 --> 01:47:34,113
It's done!

1960
01:47:34,114 --> 01:47:37,200
Yes! Come on! Boom! Yes!

1961
01:47:37,742 --> 01:47:40,745
Joshua, the order is ready
and the trucks are here.

1962
01:47:42,414 --> 01:47:43,415
Hey.

1963
01:47:43,957 --> 01:47:45,833
You impressed me, brother.

1964
01:47:45,834 --> 01:47:47,418
I didn't think
this was possible.

1965
01:47:47,419 --> 01:47:49,713
Hey. You helped me.
We got it done.

1966
01:47:51,756 --> 01:47:53,215
ALL LAUGHING

1967
01:47:53,216 --> 01:47:55,552
Isaiah. Isaiah!

1968
01:47:57,512 --> 01:47:59,264
Greyson Lance is here.

1969
01:47:59,890 --> 01:48:00,974
What?

1970
01:48:01,600 --> 01:48:03,518
EMMETT: Joshua,
you want to talk to him?

1971
01:48:08,023 --> 01:48:09,024
No.

1972
01:48:09,816 --> 01:48:11,401
Isaiah's got this.

1973
01:48:19,367 --> 01:48:21,119
God, please give me favor.

1974
01:48:35,550 --> 01:48:36,551
Mr. Lance.

1975
01:48:37,010 --> 01:48:39,970
Good morning. Isaiah Wright.
Welcome to Moore Fitness.

1976
01:48:39,971 --> 01:48:41,473
Good morning to you.

1977
01:48:42,182 --> 01:48:44,808
You had an early start.

1978
01:48:44,809 --> 01:48:46,352
5:00 a.m.

1979
01:48:46,353 --> 01:48:48,563
When Mr. Moore said
you'd be ready at 9:00...

1980
01:48:49,189 --> 01:48:50,607
I wanted to come see it
for myself.

1981
01:48:51,358 --> 01:48:52,399
ISAIAH: I'm glad you did.

1982
01:48:52,400 --> 01:48:53,944
We'd love to show you
the company.

1983
01:48:54,986 --> 01:48:56,904
Mind if my drivers
check the order?

1984
01:48:56,905 --> 01:48:59,198
Absolutely. Be our guest.
We, uh...

1985
01:48:59,199 --> 01:49:01,868
We have 3,001 units
ready to load.

1986
01:49:06,706 --> 01:49:09,084
So, how in the world
could you have this order ready?

1987
01:49:09,834 --> 01:49:12,670
Mr. Lance, your account
means a great deal to us

1988
01:49:12,671 --> 01:49:14,588
and we value our partnership
with GymFit,

1989
01:49:14,589 --> 01:49:16,258
and we're willing to go
the extra mile to keep that.

1990
01:49:17,092 --> 01:49:19,218
We had a small group
that stayed up all night

1991
01:49:19,219 --> 01:49:21,054
until the order was done,

1992
01:49:21,596 --> 01:49:23,807
and you won't find
a better team anywhere.

1993
01:49:24,474 --> 01:49:26,267
And you won't find
a better partner in business

1994
01:49:26,268 --> 01:49:27,434
than Joshua Moore.

1995
01:49:27,435 --> 01:49:29,061
And as you can see,

1996
01:49:29,062 --> 01:49:31,230
it is our privilege
to help you win

1997
01:49:31,231 --> 01:49:32,899
and keep this partnership going.

1998
01:49:34,234 --> 01:49:37,070
That's pretty bold. I like that.

1999
01:49:37,904 --> 01:49:39,197
JOSHUA: Give us
another five years.

2000
01:49:41,992 --> 01:49:44,702
Listen,
I'm a competitive person,

2001
01:49:44,703 --> 01:49:46,829
but I also want to
trust my partners.

2002
01:49:46,830 --> 01:49:49,498
Slayer Sports
tried to slow you down,

2003
01:49:49,499 --> 01:49:51,333
yet they're still
working on their order.

2004
01:49:51,334 --> 01:49:54,296
So I'm willing to go another
five years with you guys.

2005
01:49:57,507 --> 01:49:58,507
ISAIAH: Mr. Lance,

2006
01:49:58,508 --> 01:50:01,802
you've seen what we're capable
of with a partial crew,

2007
01:50:01,803 --> 01:50:04,681
so, why not be bold
and keep a good thing going?

2008
01:50:05,890 --> 01:50:07,559
Let's do seven years.

2009
01:50:26,536 --> 01:50:27,620
LANCE: Done.

2010
01:50:30,248 --> 01:50:31,458
JANELLE SIGHS

2011
01:50:32,417 --> 01:50:34,502
Again, we value your business.

2012
01:50:35,086 --> 01:50:36,755
All right, let's load it up!

2013
01:50:39,632 --> 01:50:41,634
TRIUMPHANT MUSIC PLAYING

2014
01:50:43,219 --> 01:50:45,555
INAUDIBLE

2015
01:50:47,015 --> 01:50:48,850
INAUDIBLE

2016
01:51:23,218 --> 01:51:27,262
CLARA: So, I understand that
you stayed up all night long

2017
01:51:27,263 --> 01:51:30,349
with an army of robots
to save the world.

2018
01:51:30,350 --> 01:51:32,893
Well, not the world,
but you know, it...

2019
01:51:32,894 --> 01:51:34,895
It turned out
to be a good thing.

2020
01:51:34,896 --> 01:51:37,523
And I understand you stayed up
several hours praying for us.

2021
01:51:37,524 --> 01:51:39,109
So, I just wanted to say
thank you.

2022
01:51:39,901 --> 01:51:41,276
Your mother's been telling me

2023
01:51:41,277 --> 01:51:43,987
about how you've been
chasing after the Lord,

2024
01:51:43,988 --> 01:51:46,990
becoming a disciple
of Jesus Christ.

2025
01:51:46,991 --> 01:51:49,619
Yes, ma'am.
I'm learnin'. CHUCKLES

2026
01:51:50,203 --> 01:51:51,495
Well, don't you stop.

2027
01:51:51,496 --> 01:51:53,373
Hmm. Never stop.

2028
01:51:53,998 --> 01:51:57,167
And you keep your eyes
on the Lord

2029
01:51:57,168 --> 01:51:58,753
more than on yourself,

2030
01:51:59,254 --> 01:52:03,216
and your heart on heaven
more than this world.

2031
01:52:03,800 --> 01:52:07,010
And don't you keep
taking one step forward

2032
01:52:07,011 --> 01:52:10,097
and then one step backwards
with your faith,

2033
01:52:10,098 --> 01:52:13,058
'cause, baby, that ain't nothing
but the cha-cha.

2034
01:52:13,059 --> 01:52:15,519
- ALL LAUGHING
- CLARA: No.

2035
01:52:15,520 --> 01:52:19,189
You devote your heart
to following the Lord,

2036
01:52:19,190 --> 01:52:22,902
no matter what the cost,
'cause He's worth it.

2037
01:52:23,403 --> 01:52:25,363
Yeah. He is worth it.

2038
01:52:27,991 --> 01:52:30,159
JOSHUA: Before we close out
our time,

2039
01:52:30,160 --> 01:52:32,787
I want to give Isaiah
a moment to share with us.

2040
01:52:36,624 --> 01:52:37,917
CLEARS THROAT

2041
01:52:39,085 --> 01:52:40,086
I, um...

2042
01:52:40,879 --> 01:52:45,550
I've been a part of this group
for a little over a year now,

2043
01:52:47,510 --> 01:52:48,970
and I just wanted to say
thank you.

2044
01:52:49,846 --> 01:52:51,388
You know,
it's hard to put into words

2045
01:52:51,389 --> 01:52:53,766
what this group means to me.

2046
01:52:54,893 --> 01:52:57,228
And I've lost count
of the times that, um...

2047
01:52:59,481 --> 01:53:03,025
It's been... I've been blessed
just to be here

2048
01:53:03,026 --> 01:53:05,445
and walk this thing out
with you. And, um...

2049
01:53:07,489 --> 01:53:08,698
I needed this.

2050
01:53:09,574 --> 01:53:13,285
I needed godly men
to challenge me,

2051
01:53:13,286 --> 01:53:15,204
to keep me accountable,

2052
01:53:15,205 --> 01:53:18,208
to study the Word,
and to pray for me and with me,

2053
01:53:19,417 --> 01:53:20,627
and now I want to do this
for someone else.

2054
01:53:21,419 --> 01:53:22,754
JAMES: Yes.

2055
01:53:23,796 --> 01:53:25,548
Again, thank you.

2056
01:53:32,305 --> 01:53:36,059
Gentlemen, The Forge
needs to expand.

2057
01:53:36,976 --> 01:53:38,311
Not by addition.

2058
01:53:38,937 --> 01:53:40,939
It must be by multiplication.

2059
01:53:41,898 --> 01:53:44,191
Groups like this
must spring up everywhere.

2060
01:53:44,192 --> 01:53:45,275
ALL: Yes.

2061
01:53:45,276 --> 01:53:47,987
Most churches
are trying to win converts,

2062
01:53:49,030 --> 01:53:52,699
but not enough
are effectively discipling them.

2063
01:53:52,700 --> 01:53:53,784
- Yes.
- ALL: Yes.

2064
01:53:53,785 --> 01:53:56,119
- We must go serve them.
- ALL: Yes.

2065
01:53:56,120 --> 01:53:59,957
The world doesn't need
more lukewarm church goers.

2066
01:53:59,958 --> 01:54:02,292
Jesus said
in the great commission,

2067
01:54:02,293 --> 01:54:05,963
"Go out into all the world
and make disciples."

2068
01:54:05,964 --> 01:54:07,381
ALL: Yes.

2069
01:54:07,382 --> 01:54:08,882
JOSHUA: We need more believers

2070
01:54:08,883 --> 01:54:12,719
who are whole-heartedly
following Jesus.

2071
01:54:12,720 --> 01:54:14,596
That's what
the world needs to see.

2072
01:54:14,597 --> 01:54:15,681
ALL: Yes.

2073
01:54:15,682 --> 01:54:17,015
JOSHUA: We have
to go after them...

2074
01:54:17,016 --> 01:54:18,350
ALL: Yes.

2075
01:54:18,351 --> 01:54:20,978
...because whoever wants
the next generation the most

2076
01:54:20,979 --> 01:54:22,063
will get them.

2077
01:54:22,772 --> 01:54:25,566
This culture is aggressively

2078
01:54:25,567 --> 01:54:28,319
chasing after their hearts
and their minds

2079
01:54:28,945 --> 01:54:32,240
with a view of morality,
purpose, truth

2080
01:54:32,991 --> 01:54:35,451
that's continually redefined.

2081
01:54:36,077 --> 01:54:39,371
But God has given us the truth,
His Word.

2082
01:54:39,372 --> 01:54:42,500
- The anchor that we hold on to.
- ALL: Yes.

2083
01:54:43,042 --> 01:54:46,003
JOSHUA: So even as I pray
for Isaiah,

2084
01:54:46,004 --> 01:54:47,796
I pray for you,

2085
01:54:47,797 --> 01:54:50,215
that you not be one in a million

2086
01:54:50,216 --> 01:54:52,593
- but one of a million.
- ALL: Yes.

2087
01:54:52,594 --> 01:54:54,637
JOSHUA: So I say,
let's go where they are!

2088
01:54:55,555 --> 01:54:58,056
In the schools,
in the ballfields,

2089
01:54:58,057 --> 01:54:59,641
in the marketplaces.

2090
01:54:59,642 --> 01:55:00,976
Wherever they hang out,

2091
01:55:00,977 --> 01:55:03,395
we must be there,
and we must find them.

2092
01:55:03,396 --> 01:55:05,272
Let's do what Jesus did.

2093
01:55:05,273 --> 01:55:07,108
Let's go love 'em
with the truth.

2094
01:55:07,650 --> 01:55:10,278
- Let's take them Jesus.
- ALL: Yes.

2095
01:55:10,987 --> 01:55:12,196
Who's with me?

2096
01:56:34,696 --> 01:56:36,071
WOMAN: Yeah,
let's plan to meet Friday.

2097
01:56:36,072 --> 01:56:38,198
So I'll see you guys
Friday night? Okay.

2098
01:56:38,199 --> 01:56:40,118
- Oh, my gosh. I'm so sorry.
- Excuse me.

2099
01:56:41,661 --> 01:56:45,206
Uh... Hey,
it's... Abigail, right?

2100
01:56:46,499 --> 01:56:48,166
And you're Isaiah.

2101
01:56:48,167 --> 01:56:50,377
Yeah. CHUCKLES Good memory.

2102
01:56:50,378 --> 01:56:53,213
- You go to school here?
- Yeah. I just started.

2103
01:56:53,214 --> 01:56:55,758
But you know, I'm still learning
my way around campus. So...

2104
01:56:55,883 --> 01:56:57,008
BOTH CHUCKLE

2105
01:56:57,009 --> 01:56:58,969
Yeah. You... You a junior?

2106
01:56:58,970 --> 01:57:01,346
Sophomore. Interior design.

2107
01:57:01,347 --> 01:57:02,724
- Oh, nice.
- You?

2108
01:57:04,100 --> 01:57:05,434
Business. I hope.

2109
01:57:05,435 --> 01:57:06,977
LAUGHS Right.

2110
01:57:06,978 --> 01:57:09,354
Well, um, hey, just so you know,

2111
01:57:09,355 --> 01:57:12,023
you really made an impact
on my dad.

2112
01:57:12,024 --> 01:57:13,525
- Oh, yeah?
- Oh, yeah.

2113
01:57:13,526 --> 01:57:15,152
He's brought you up
a few times now.

2114
01:57:15,153 --> 01:57:17,529
Well... Well, you know, I, um...

2115
01:57:17,530 --> 01:57:19,781
I really appreciate him for
taking the time to talk with me,

2116
01:57:19,782 --> 01:57:22,201
so, you know, I might have
to drop by, say hello sometime.

2117
01:57:22,785 --> 01:57:24,619
But not to get coffee.

2118
01:57:24,620 --> 01:57:25,996
BOTH CHUCKLE

2119
01:57:25,997 --> 01:57:28,415
I mean, I just, I don't know.

2120
01:57:28,416 --> 01:57:29,708
Just never got into it,
you know.

2121
01:57:29,709 --> 01:57:31,376
I mainly drink energy drinks.

2122
01:57:31,377 --> 01:57:32,544
It's cool. I get it.

2123
01:57:32,545 --> 01:57:34,464
But coffee is better for you.

2124
01:57:34,589 --> 01:57:36,882
And there's actually a really
good shop here on campus.

2125
01:57:36,883 --> 01:57:39,301
Well, you know,
I might have to try that out.

2126
01:57:39,302 --> 01:57:41,471
But I may need some suggestions.
Just saying.

2127
01:57:42,096 --> 01:57:44,932
Okay. Well,
where are you headed now?

2128
01:57:46,100 --> 01:57:47,727
Glad you asked. Uh...

2129
01:57:48,311 --> 01:57:51,689
I'm looking for...
Here it is. Mitchell building?

2130
01:57:52,315 --> 01:57:54,066
- I could show you.
- That'd be great.

2131
01:57:54,484 --> 01:57:57,028
- Hey, coffee on me.
- Sounds good.

2132
01:57:57,987 --> 01:57:59,279
So, why business?

2133
01:57:59,280 --> 01:58:01,365
