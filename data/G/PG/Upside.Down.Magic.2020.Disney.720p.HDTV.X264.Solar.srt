00:00:04,129 --> 00:00:07,465
My mom used to say that everybody
has their something.

3
00:00:08,300 --> 00:00:12,721
A special thing that makes them,
well, them!

4
00:00:14,265 --> 00:00:16,391
For some kids,
their something is sports.

5
00:00:16,432 --> 00:00:17,434
Nice shot!

6
00:00:18,768 --> 00:00:21,271
For some kids,
their something is art.

7
00:00:23,356 --> 00:00:26,986
For some kids,
their something is music.

8
00:00:31,240 --> 00:00:35,035
Maybe not these kids, but, you know,
A for effort.

9
00:00:37,204 --> 00:00:40,832
When I was seven, Mom got sick, and...

10
00:00:41,625 --> 00:00:43,335
then it was just me and Dad.

11
00:00:46,045 --> 00:00:47,839
I thought I had lost everything.

12
00:00:50,301 --> 00:00:52,928
But then, I found my something.

13
00:01:13,823 --> 00:01:16,826
Hey, Nory, I found...

14
00:01:17,620 --> 00:01:19,121
It turns out my something...

15
00:01:23,709 --> 00:01:25,043
was magic.

16
00:01:25,293 --> 00:01:29,131
Upside down now
Oh, no

17
00:01:29,381 --> 00:01:31,466
What's going on here
The world has turned around

18
00:01:31,759 --> 00:01:36,096
Okay! Tomorrow's a big day
and so today is a big deal!

19
00:01:36,471 --> 00:01:40,308
Tomorrow, after waiting six long years,

20
00:01:40,725 --> 00:01:43,228
I head off to Sage Academy.

21
00:01:44,647 --> 00:01:47,733
Where super-awesome magic kids
like myself,

22
00:01:47,775 --> 00:01:50,903
learn how to be super-awesomer
and magic-er.

23
00:01:51,653 --> 00:01:54,447
Could be scary. Could be overwhelming.

24
00:01:55,533 --> 00:01:58,284
Nah, it won't because
I'm not going on my own.

25
00:01:58,701 --> 00:02:02,748
I'm going with my best of BFFs,
the amazing, mystifying,

26
00:02:02,790 --> 00:02:07,044
and also magic-ifying, Reina Carvajal!

27
00:02:09,295 --> 00:02:12,132
"Amazing"? "Mystifying"? "Magic-ifying"?

28
00:02:12,174 --> 00:02:14,802
What? I'm practicing hyping you up.

29
00:02:14,843 --> 00:02:17,805
I need to let that school know
they've got a superstar on their hands!

30
00:02:17,847 --> 00:02:21,516
I'm just trying to make it
through the first semester in one piece.

31
00:02:21,558 --> 00:02:23,185
Are you kidding? We're gonna be great.

32
00:02:23,811 --> 00:02:24,895
Go ahead.

33
00:02:24,937 --> 00:02:27,439
Show everyone how good you are
without any training.

34
00:02:27,730 --> 00:02:29,858
Okay. Okay, ready.

35
00:02:30,651 --> 00:02:33,695
- Any requests?
- You know what I'm gonna say.

36
00:02:33,736 --> 00:02:35,906
- You're gonna say "Sparkle Fireba..."
- Sparkle Fireball!

37
00:02:35,948 --> 00:02:38,659
For sure, no doubt.
It's my favorite.

38
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:40,618
You say everything I do is your favorite.

39
00:02:40,995 --> 00:02:44,456
Yeah, but Sparkle Fireball
is my favorite favorite.

40
00:02:45,248 --> 00:02:47,877
It's a good one. But it's really hard.

41
00:02:48,961 --> 00:02:53,632
Not for you!
You are a flame-throwing rockstar.

42
00:03:08,938 --> 00:03:09,939
How was that?

43
00:03:12,151 --> 00:03:13,110
It was all right.

44
00:03:14,944 --> 00:03:18,781
If you like incredibly, awesome,
mind-blowing, magical powers!

45
00:03:18,824 --> 00:03:21,243
'Cause you are so good at magic
it's bananas.

46
00:03:21,284 --> 00:03:23,746
You are going to rock Sage so hard.

47
00:03:23,787 --> 00:03:28,375
It's we who are going to rock Sage
so hard. Me and you.

48
00:03:29,126 --> 00:03:31,212
Speaking of. Your turn.

49
00:03:32,128 --> 00:03:35,507
Okay. Okay. Give me a second.
Let me concentrate.

50
00:03:40,012 --> 00:03:41,514
Kitten, kitten, kitten.

51
00:03:43,181 --> 00:03:45,600
Well, this is new.

52
00:03:46,268 --> 00:03:48,562
I'm seeing kitten, of course,
but also...

53
00:03:49,437 --> 00:03:52,024
kangaroo and beaver?

54
00:03:56,277 --> 00:03:58,239
Hey, where'd you get my pencil?

55
00:04:02,033 --> 00:04:06,996
I wish I just had a little more control
over the wacko-animals I turn into.

56
00:04:07,247 --> 00:04:09,834
You're still magic.
That's what matters most.

57
00:04:10,793 --> 00:04:15,131
Yeah, but like,
you just think about fire and... poof!

58
00:04:16,632 --> 00:04:20,093
I think about a cat and I turn into
a terrifying abomination.

59
00:04:20,136 --> 00:04:21,804
That's why we're going to Sage.

60
00:04:22,303 --> 00:04:26,474
They're gonna teach you to be the best
abomination you can be.

61
00:04:55,211 --> 00:04:58,048
Dad, are you sure we're in
the right place?

62
00:04:58,089 --> 00:05:00,425
Is there supposed to be a bus
or something?

63
00:05:00,468 --> 00:05:02,136
This is where they told us to go.

64
00:05:03,512 --> 00:05:04,680
Are you okay?

65
00:05:06,055 --> 00:05:09,767
- I... I might be a little nervous.
- That's natural.

66
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:12,103
Your mom said she was nervous, too.

67
00:05:12,812 --> 00:05:15,483
She was? But she was so good at magic.

68
00:05:15,733 --> 00:05:18,276
Of course she was nervous!
New things are scary!

69
00:05:18,735 --> 00:05:19,819
But...

70
00:05:20,737 --> 00:05:22,156
I know you're gonna be okay.

71
00:05:23,656 --> 00:05:26,618
Then you know what?
I know I'm gonna be okay, too.

72
00:05:27,827 --> 00:05:29,871
- You know what else?
- What else?

73
00:05:32,415 --> 00:05:36,252
- You're going to magic school!
- I'm going to magic school!

74
00:05:49,975 --> 00:05:51,227
What's happening?

75
00:05:52,937 --> 00:05:57,858
Something awesome, right?
Some kind of magical amazing, something.

76
00:05:59,776 --> 00:06:03,447
Hey, come on, let's go!
The school's not gonna walk to you!

77
00:06:03,781 --> 00:06:05,949
Bye-bye parents!
See you at Thanksgiving.

78
00:06:06,617 --> 00:06:09,578
Adios! Sayonara! Au revoir!

79
00:06:09,620 --> 00:06:13,915
Catch you later! Ciao! TTYL! Bye!

80
00:06:14,290 --> 00:06:18,504
Okay, come on, here we go,
no time to waste, can't stop for anything.

81
00:06:18,545 --> 00:06:19,879
Oh, except this.

82
00:06:20,213 --> 00:06:22,757
So, clap, clap, clap.
You can all do magic

83
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:24,009
Big whoop, I get it.

84
00:06:24,384 --> 00:06:27,512
That's why you're going to magic school,
where you'll be up to your magical butts

85
00:06:27,555 --> 00:06:30,266
in magical magic
for the next six magical years.

86
00:06:30,307 --> 00:06:35,104
But, like, the one rule
of this little nature hike is no magic.

87
00:06:35,146 --> 00:06:37,564
Okay? Here we go, come on!

88
00:06:40,192 --> 00:06:41,192
Bye, Dad!

89
00:06:47,533 --> 00:06:52,079
Okay, hello! Noisy, magic children,
please, keep your voices down,

90
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:56,000
as there are mystical creatures
and vicious monsterlings out there.

91
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:59,377
We don't want them jumping out
and tearing you all limb for limb.

92
00:07:02,464 --> 00:07:04,340
Wow, that is really too easy.

93
00:07:04,966 --> 00:07:08,428
Okay. Everyone chill, I'm kidding.
There are no mystical creatures.

94
00:07:08,471 --> 00:07:11,055
Okay, unless you think skunks
are mystical.

95
00:07:11,389 --> 00:07:13,141
Save your spray, dude.

96
00:07:13,184 --> 00:07:15,769
He was just explaining the rules,
he didn't mean any offense.

97
00:07:15,810 --> 00:07:19,439
Hey! What'd I just say about not doing
magic right now?

98
00:07:19,857 --> 00:07:21,609
I wasn't doing magic!
I was just...

99
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:26,572
talking to a skunk?

100
00:07:27,031 --> 00:07:28,865
Put a sock in it, skunk whisperer.

101
00:07:32,452 --> 00:07:36,748
I know, I know, that is so uncool, bro.
We'll talk later, okay?

102
00:07:37,625 --> 00:07:40,252
Hmm. What's up with emo-Joe over there?

103
00:07:40,293 --> 00:07:42,295
Maybe you should try talking to him
and find out.

104
00:07:42,797 --> 00:07:47,551
Yeah! Good idea! Get out there, mingle,
shake hands, kiss babies.

105
00:07:47,802 --> 00:07:51,180
After all, these are our people.

106
00:07:54,016 --> 00:07:55,016
Hey!

107
00:07:56,310 --> 00:07:57,353
I'm Nory.

108
00:07:58,144 --> 00:07:59,562
Nory Boxwood Horace.

109
00:08:00,939 --> 00:08:03,776
Very cool backpack, by the way.
Where did you get...

110
00:08:06,737 --> 00:08:10,074
- Our people are not big talkers.
- Solid effort though.

111
00:08:24,963 --> 00:08:27,007
You know what's worse
than this spooky forest?

112
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:28,800
Nothing?

113
00:08:29,218 --> 00:08:32,388
That old guy wearing cargo shorts
over long johns.

114
00:08:44,899 --> 00:08:48,444
Awesome.
A creepy nightmare hole.

115
00:08:49,321 --> 00:08:53,993
Excuse me, sir, are we lost?

116
00:08:54,033 --> 00:08:57,913
Well, how would I know?
I'm just an old guy in wack threads.

117
00:09:00,416 --> 00:09:03,794
Now. Follow me, if you dare.

118
00:09:11,259 --> 00:09:12,385
Whoa!

119
00:09:17,182 --> 00:09:20,519
Nory? I could use one of those pep-talks
where you...

120
00:09:20,852 --> 00:09:25,274
tell me I'm a flame-throwing rock star,
because this is a lot.

121
00:09:26,774 --> 00:09:31,029
You are a flame-throwing rock star.
And this is a lot.

122
00:09:31,822 --> 00:09:34,073
But we got this.

123
00:10:27,544 --> 00:10:30,923
Eh. Don't even bother.
Those don't work here.

124
00:10:31,465 --> 00:10:32,550
Aw...

125
00:10:41,475 --> 00:10:44,019
These other fire kids are really good.

126
00:10:44,602 --> 00:10:47,939
Not better than you!
Reina, we're here!

127
00:10:54,947 --> 00:10:59,326
Students.
Students! Students!

128
00:11:01,202 --> 00:11:03,706
Welcome to orientation.

129
00:11:04,206 --> 00:11:08,252
I am Ms. Knightslinger,
the headmaster of Sage Academy.

130
00:11:09,043 --> 00:11:10,545
You are here at Sage

131
00:11:10,587 --> 00:11:15,134
because you display some measure
of innate magical talent.

132
00:11:15,384 --> 00:11:17,470
All of you will need guidance

133
00:11:17,510 --> 00:11:21,557
and instruction to develop
your magic correctly.

134
00:11:22,099 --> 00:11:25,478
The right way. The only way,

135
00:11:26,187 --> 00:11:27,770
the Sage way.

136
00:11:29,148 --> 00:11:33,110
Yes, it is all very exciting, I suppose.
Now!

137
00:11:34,736 --> 00:11:41,117
Sage has five distinct schools,
based on the five types of talent.

138
00:11:41,619 --> 00:11:45,372
Fuzzies, who communicate
with the animal kingdom.

139
00:11:45,663 --> 00:11:50,126
Flickers, who can make an object come
to them with the flick of a hand.

140
00:11:50,836 --> 00:11:54,255
Flares, who can harness the power of fire.

141
00:11:54,881 --> 00:11:58,384
Flyers, who, well, fly.

142
00:11:58,427 --> 00:12:03,724
And Fluxers, who have the power
to transform into any animal at will.

143
00:12:03,765 --> 00:12:05,141
Yes! This girl right here!

144
00:12:05,475 --> 00:12:07,977
Fluxing butt and taking numbers!

145
00:12:10,313 --> 00:12:11,272
Are we done?

146
00:12:14,067 --> 00:12:18,072
Sorry. I'm a Fluxer. But I´m done now.
Not done being a Fluxer,

147
00:12:18,113 --> 00:12:20,115
but done talking.
Reina, tell me to be quiet.

148
00:12:20,157 --> 00:12:21,450
- Nory, be quiet.
- Okie-doke.

149
00:12:23,201 --> 00:12:25,120
As I was saying,

150
00:12:25,162 --> 00:12:28,249
you have a magical talent,
and that got you in the door.

151
00:12:28,289 --> 00:12:30,918
And by now, you're probably very clear
what that talent is,

152
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:33,045
and which school you are in.

153
00:12:33,086 --> 00:12:34,420
- Fluxer!
- Nory!

154
00:12:34,462 --> 00:12:35,673
- Flare!
- Nory.

155
00:12:35,923 --> 00:12:37,633
Nory! Be quiet! Okie-doke.

156
00:12:38,216 --> 00:12:40,260
Moving on.

157
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:45,348
We require all new students
to take a placement test,

158
00:12:45,765 --> 00:12:49,644
to see if you qualify
for our honors level classes.

159
00:13:04,909 --> 00:13:08,831
The Sage way
to evaluate Flare aptitude is thus,

160
00:13:09,164 --> 00:13:12,625
be able to light a candle
from six feet away.

161
00:13:13,543 --> 00:13:14,752
That's it?

162
00:13:14,794 --> 00:13:18,173
I can make a basketball out of fire,
and dunk it through a hoop,

163
00:13:18,466 --> 00:13:19,966
also made out of fire.

164
00:13:20,009 --> 00:13:24,763
You are not here to show off.
You are here to learn the Sage way.

165
00:13:25,014 --> 00:13:26,014
Now do it.

166
00:13:35,149 --> 00:13:37,067
Please collect your card
and wait in the quad.

167
00:13:45,993 --> 00:13:46,994
Hmm.

168
00:14:05,386 --> 00:14:06,387
Uh...

169
00:14:07,639 --> 00:14:08,848
Hey-o.

170
00:14:08,890 --> 00:14:12,477
Mister Elliot Cohen?
Please don't waste our time.

171
00:14:12,519 --> 00:14:14,230
- Light the candle.
- Okay.

172
00:14:38,044 --> 00:14:40,088
First lost cause of the day.

173
00:15:01,192 --> 00:15:03,528
- Was that okay?
- Very good, Reina.

174
00:15:04,196 --> 00:15:06,532
Please get your card
and wait in the quad.

175
00:15:11,035 --> 00:15:14,247
The Sage way
to evaluate Fuzzies is thus,

176
00:15:14,539 --> 00:15:16,375
you will ask this dog a series
of questions

177
00:15:16,417 --> 00:15:19,586
to which only we have the answer.
Proceed.

178
00:15:20,587 --> 00:15:23,423
Hey, bro. What's your name?

179
00:15:23,966 --> 00:15:25,091
- Banjo.
- Banjo.

180
00:15:25,134 --> 00:15:26,927
- Banjo.
- Hey, Banjo.

181
00:15:28,095 --> 00:15:29,638
- He's from Cleveland.
- Cleveland.

182
00:15:30,639 --> 00:15:35,394
His favorite food is chicken a la king,
but he also really needs to go walkies.

183
00:15:40,274 --> 00:15:43,568
The Sage way
to evaluate Flickers is thus,

184
00:15:44,068 --> 00:15:47,322
make the vase come to you
from six feet away.

185
00:15:50,868 --> 00:15:52,076
Ms. Paloma?

186
00:15:53,870 --> 00:15:55,371
- Pepper!
- What?

187
00:15:55,998 --> 00:15:57,249
Vase. You. Now.

188
00:16:01,294 --> 00:16:02,253
Yeah, okay.

189
00:16:21,023 --> 00:16:24,067
- We good?
- Quite.

190
00:16:28,780 --> 00:16:32,200
The Sage way to evaluate Fliers is thus,

191
00:16:33,159 --> 00:16:36,956
fly three feet off the ground,
stay in the air for 30 seconds,

192
00:16:36,996 --> 00:16:38,331
and land safely.

193
00:16:51,761 --> 00:16:53,680
Andres, we're waiting.

194
00:16:57,433 --> 00:16:58,351
Andres!

195
00:17:05,526 --> 00:17:08,153
Well, I don't need to tell you
that is more than three feet.

196
00:17:08,194 --> 00:17:11,281
Thank you, Andres.
You can come down now.

197
00:17:13,576 --> 00:17:15,995
You can't? Wonderful!

198
00:17:16,787 --> 00:17:17,913
Skriff!

199
00:17:28,632 --> 00:17:31,552
The Sage way
of evaluating Fluxers is thus,

200
00:17:32,051 --> 00:17:36,347
flux into this grey tabby kitten,
hold the form for six seconds,

201
00:17:36,390 --> 00:17:39,351
and then flux back to your human form.

202
00:17:43,189 --> 00:17:47,359
One, two, three,

203
00:17:48,109 --> 00:17:51,404
four, five, six.

204
00:18:12,593 --> 00:18:15,179
- Nory.
- Yo.

205
00:18:15,721 --> 00:18:17,890
Please flux into this kitten for us.

206
00:18:17,932 --> 00:18:19,517
- Just the kitten?
- Yes!

207
00:18:20,017 --> 00:18:22,436
- So, that kitten.
- Nory.

208
00:18:22,811 --> 00:18:28,149
Okay. One kitten,
of the grey tabby variety.

209
00:18:28,858 --> 00:18:31,110
Coming up. Made to order.

210
00:18:32,195 --> 00:18:33,571
Hot and fresh.

211
00:18:58,638 --> 00:19:00,974
One, two...

212
00:19:15,071 --> 00:19:16,281
Oh.

213
00:19:24,748 --> 00:19:27,833
Ta-da! Pretty cool, right?

214
00:19:27,835 --> 00:19:30,962
Was there some llama in there?
It felt like a little bit of llama.

215
00:19:31,005 --> 00:19:33,841
That was very unique.

216
00:19:43,976 --> 00:19:45,895
Attention, everyone!

217
00:20:05,038 --> 00:20:11,545
It is always a joy to meet the new class,
and today is no exception.

218
00:20:12,546 --> 00:20:15,341
Well, perhaps a there were
a few exceptions.

219
00:20:15,382 --> 00:20:18,510
Regardless, everyone,
please take a look at your cards,

220
00:20:18,551 --> 00:20:21,721
and find out where
you have been placed!

221
00:20:43,701 --> 00:20:47,080
- Nory, look!
- Awesome! Congrats.

222
00:20:47,873 --> 00:20:49,290
What does yours say?

223
00:20:57,048 --> 00:21:00,469
- That's not anything.
- Maybe it's broken.

224
00:21:00,510 --> 00:21:02,471
- Ask somebody.
- All right, students!

225
00:21:02,512 --> 00:21:06,182
Off to the dining hall
to get your uniforms!

226
00:21:14,942 --> 00:21:17,528
No, Nory. You go that way.

227
00:21:22,199 --> 00:21:23,409
Come along, Reina.

228
00:21:25,536 --> 00:21:26,495
You gonna be okay?

229
00:21:27,163 --> 00:21:30,082
Of course I am.
Now go get 'em, rock star.

230
00:21:39,842 --> 00:21:41,594
What's a UDM?

231
00:22:12,565 --> 00:22:13,692
Uh, hello?

232
00:22:16,778 --> 00:22:17,987
Anyone?

233
00:22:18,572 --> 00:22:19,448
Who are you?

234
00:22:20,824 --> 00:22:21,700
Nory.

235
00:22:23,284 --> 00:22:25,496
I was right behind you on the walk
this morning.

236
00:22:27,331 --> 00:22:29,041
I looked kinda like this?

237
00:22:33,086 --> 00:22:35,922
Ah! Yes, you are, yes, you were,
and yes, you did.

238
00:22:36,423 --> 00:22:39,676
Okay, come on down.
And shut the door behind you.

239
00:22:50,146 --> 00:22:51,272
The door, kid.

240
00:23:09,247 --> 00:23:11,249
- What's this?
- It's your uniform.

241
00:23:14,461 --> 00:23:16,921
Where's the cool jacket and hoodie
all the other kids get?

242
00:23:17,297 --> 00:23:22,135
Oh, uh, you get to wear your own
cool jacket and, or hoodie.

243
00:23:22,594 --> 00:23:23,970
Isn't that exciting...

244
00:23:24,471 --> 00:23:27,057
- in theory?
- We don't get a special color?

245
00:23:27,390 --> 00:23:33,104
No. But you do get a desk.
So sit down. Pop a squat.

246
00:23:33,147 --> 00:23:34,314
Take a seat.

247
00:23:34,355 --> 00:23:37,984
I am Mr. Skriff,
and I am in charge of the UDM.

248
00:23:39,736 --> 00:23:42,073
What is this place?
Are you sure I´m supposed to be here?

249
00:23:42,656 --> 00:23:45,284
Did you tank your placement exam
like us?

250
00:23:45,534 --> 00:23:50,414
No! I blew their minds, with magic
they could barely understand.

251
00:23:51,082 --> 00:23:54,418
In other words, you tanked
your placement exam. Like them.

252
00:23:55,002 --> 00:23:57,630
He made smoke instead of fire.

253
00:23:58,089 --> 00:24:01,092
She pushed the vase away
instead of toward her.

254
00:24:01,758 --> 00:24:04,844
He could go up,
but he couldn't come down.

255
00:24:04,887 --> 00:24:07,848
And you couldn't be just a kitten.

256
00:24:08,224 --> 00:24:11,685
So, butt. Seat. Now.

257
00:24:11,726 --> 00:24:15,022
I'm still pretty sure I'm not supposed
to be here.

258
00:24:15,063 --> 00:24:19,860
Oh, and I'm deffo sure that you are.
Why? Because you're wonky.

259
00:24:19,901 --> 00:24:23,738
And weird and your magic is defective.
Yup, that's why you're all here,

260
00:24:23,781 --> 00:24:27,743
wonky, weird, defective magic.
We don't always know why it happens.

261
00:24:27,784 --> 00:24:31,496
We don't really care why it happens,
but when it does, you come to me.

262
00:24:31,538 --> 00:24:35,041
So, welcome to the School
of Upside-Down Magic.

263
00:24:35,543 --> 00:24:37,544
So, UDM means...

264
00:24:37,585 --> 00:24:42,006
"Upside-down magic."
Congratulations, you are a genius.

265
00:24:42,591 --> 00:24:46,594
Or rather, not a genius,
at least where magic is concerned.

266
00:24:50,015 --> 00:24:54,018
But buck up, kiddo! With a little luck,
we'll get that fixed.

267
00:24:54,061 --> 00:24:55,563
- Really?
- No, probably not.

268
00:24:55,603 --> 00:24:57,355
I mean maybe, but not usually.

269
00:24:57,398 --> 00:24:59,150
Possibly, I wouldn't count on it.

270
00:24:59,190 --> 00:25:01,360
But we, like get to do magic though,
right?

271
00:25:03,028 --> 00:25:04,029
Right?

272
00:25:05,322 --> 00:25:07,323
Uh, no. No, we do not.

273
00:25:07,365 --> 00:25:10,368
We study, like, school stuff here.
Okay?

274
00:25:10,619 --> 00:25:14,457
Math and things. Assignments.

275
00:25:15,123 --> 00:25:16,291
Magic assignments?

276
00:25:16,332 --> 00:25:19,586
Are you even listening?
No! No magic!

277
00:25:20,086 --> 00:25:24,549
It's my job to help keep you productive,
busy, engaged.

278
00:25:24,800 --> 00:25:26,092
It's also my job

279
00:25:26,134 --> 00:25:29,179
to be the groundskeeper
and handle general maintenance issues

280
00:25:29,220 --> 00:25:31,015
at this fine institution.

281
00:25:31,056 --> 00:25:34,893
- So, wait. Are you a teacher or what?
- Am I a teacher?

282
00:25:34,935 --> 00:25:37,354
What I am is very busy, okay?

283
00:25:37,396 --> 00:25:40,066
So, please, do not pester me
with abstract questions.

284
00:25:40,107 --> 00:25:44,070
Well, here's a clear, direct one then,
why can't we study magic here?

285
00:25:44,111 --> 00:25:45,487
Because your magic

286
00:25:45,905 --> 00:25:47,448
is wrong.

287
00:25:47,823 --> 00:25:50,200
But, that's why we're here.
To learn how to do it right.

288
00:25:50,575 --> 00:25:54,371
You are never going to learn
how to do it right.

289
00:25:55,038 --> 00:25:59,292
Upside-down magic
will never be proper magic.

290
00:25:59,627 --> 00:26:03,339
In the eyes of Sage,
you are unteachable.

291
00:26:04,506 --> 00:26:06,342
So, what happens now?

292
00:26:07,008 --> 00:26:09,719
You sit here. And you wait.

293
00:26:10,012 --> 00:26:13,307
- For what?
- For your magic to disappear.

294
00:26:14,809 --> 00:26:16,936
Magic is like a muscle.

295
00:26:17,311 --> 00:26:19,938
If you don't use it,
it will wither away,

296
00:26:19,979 --> 00:26:21,481
and eventually cease to work.

297
00:26:22,358 --> 00:26:25,027
And then, we send you
back into the world,

298
00:26:25,069 --> 00:26:27,196
where you can pursue a life as...

299
00:26:27,697 --> 00:26:31,617
an accountant, or a dog groomer,

300
00:26:31,867 --> 00:26:33,577
or whatever it is people do.

301
00:26:34,160 --> 00:26:37,081
What possible reason
could you have for taking

302
00:26:37,122 --> 00:26:41,043
a bunch of perfectly good magic kids
and letting them go bad like,

303
00:26:41,835 --> 00:26:43,962
a bunch of bananas
you forgot in a drawer?

304
00:26:44,380 --> 00:26:46,841
To protect humanity.

305
00:26:51,594 --> 00:26:55,682
For a while, Sage treated UDMs
like any other students.

306
00:26:55,725 --> 00:27:01,605
Until 1939, and a student named

307
00:27:01,938 --> 00:27:04,233
Reginald Roberts.

308
00:27:07,027 --> 00:27:09,070
Reginald was a Flare.

309
00:27:11,407 --> 00:27:14,702
But he could only express his flame

310
00:27:14,744 --> 00:27:18,164
through his basement furnace.

311
00:27:22,168 --> 00:27:25,838
And yes, it was very funny to all.
But little did we know

312
00:27:26,088 --> 00:27:31,260
that Reginald's upside-down magic
made him the perfect host for...

313
00:27:32,178 --> 00:27:33,387
Shadow magic.

314
00:27:37,140 --> 00:27:40,018
The dark side to our magic.

315
00:27:40,811 --> 00:27:46,192
Magic that exists solely to cause chaos
and anarchy.

316
00:27:47,776 --> 00:27:52,238
We were able to overcome the beast
that Reginald had become,

317
00:27:52,864 --> 00:27:54,199
but just barely.

318
00:28:06,294 --> 00:28:09,297
Shadow magic cannot work
without a human host.

319
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:13,177
And UDMs are its sole target.

320
00:28:13,761 --> 00:28:16,847
Like, how a crack in a piece of fruit

321
00:28:17,223 --> 00:28:19,809
allows the rot to seep in.

322
00:28:20,892 --> 00:28:25,855
That's you.
You are that cracked fruit.

323
00:28:26,399 --> 00:28:29,150
So. You will stay down here.

324
00:28:29,401 --> 00:28:34,114
You will not practice magic.
And your magic will die.

325
00:28:38,535 --> 00:28:41,871
But better it than all of us.

326
00:28:44,124 --> 00:28:46,419
I suspect there are no further questions.

327
00:28:48,461 --> 00:28:50,463
Thank you. Skriff. Skriff!

328
00:28:55,009 --> 00:28:56,469
As you were.

329
00:29:02,517 --> 00:29:05,187
Okay. Well then,

330
00:29:05,688 --> 00:29:08,774
let's begin with my inaugural lecture,

331
00:29:09,190 --> 00:29:11,986
"How to deal with having all
of your dreams crushed

332
00:29:12,027 --> 00:29:15,363
"by smushing your feelings into a ball
deep inside your stomach."

333
00:29:15,406 --> 00:29:17,700
Now. Write this down.

334
00:29:18,575 --> 00:29:22,454
Step one, take your feelings
and smush them real good

335
00:29:22,496 --> 00:29:25,123
into a tiny ball
deep inside your stomach.

336
00:29:25,498 --> 00:29:26,499
"Step one...

337
00:29:28,002 --> 00:29:31,172
"do everything I can
to get my magic right-side up,

338
00:29:32,047 --> 00:29:34,257
"and become a real Fluxer."

339
00:29:44,351 --> 00:29:47,438
Welcome to Honors Flare class.

340
00:29:48,188 --> 00:29:51,900
It's called "Honors"
because it is an honor to be here.

341
00:29:52,192 --> 00:29:54,736
And, if any of you do not live up
to that honor,

342
00:29:54,778 --> 00:29:56,738
you will be demoted immediately.

343
00:29:57,656 --> 00:30:00,159
Now, small piece of business
before we get started.

344
00:30:00,868 --> 00:30:05,373
In a few weeks, Sage will hold
our Annual Founders´ Day,

345
00:30:06,082 --> 00:30:09,251
a celebration of our distinguished alumni.

346
00:30:09,502 --> 00:30:14,298
As part of the festivities,
there will be a student presentation.

347
00:30:14,756 --> 00:30:18,593
Each school will select its top two
first-year students.

348
00:30:19,553 --> 00:30:23,890
Those students will compete
in a head to head battle we like to call

349
00:30:24,516 --> 00:30:25,976
the Sage Match.

350
00:30:27,436 --> 00:30:31,899
The winner from each school
gets to perform for the alumni,

351
00:30:31,940 --> 00:30:34,693
and all of Sage,
in the Founders´ Day presentation.

352
00:30:35,652 --> 00:30:37,904
Now. On to our studies.

353
00:30:38,488 --> 00:30:42,992
Flaring is more than making fire.

354
00:30:43,451 --> 00:30:48,207
Flaring is the modulated application
of heat.

355
00:30:49,624 --> 00:30:50,709
Reina!

356
00:30:52,544 --> 00:30:55,380
You had a rather good evaluation,
didn't you?

357
00:30:58,133 --> 00:31:00,468
Come down. You see, Reina,

358
00:31:01,720 --> 00:31:05,181
even the most basic Flare
can light a candle.

359
00:31:05,432 --> 00:31:07,392
But popcorn...

360
00:31:15,484 --> 00:31:19,905
See, that requires just the right touch.

361
00:31:23,074 --> 00:31:24,534
Let's see if you have it.

362
00:31:46,348 --> 00:31:49,060
I am a flame-throwing rock star.

363
00:32:18,505 --> 00:32:21,801
Reina, how do you think you did?

364
00:32:24,219 --> 00:32:25,178
Terribly.

365
00:32:27,806 --> 00:32:28,973
I'm sorry, Professor.

366
00:32:30,810 --> 00:32:32,102
First day jitters.

367
00:32:33,019 --> 00:32:36,648
First day jitters? Okay. Sure.

368
00:32:38,150 --> 00:32:40,486
Do you know how many
first days you get?

369
00:32:41,696 --> 00:32:43,781
One. Sit.

370
00:32:45,073 --> 00:32:47,200
Now. Next victim.

371
00:32:48,159 --> 00:32:50,955
Let's see if you can do better
than "terribly."

372
00:33:31,954 --> 00:33:33,205
Not that I care,

373
00:33:33,246 --> 00:33:36,207
but will we be having like,
a class today?

374
00:33:36,583 --> 00:33:39,794
Class? You kids would rather sit
in a classroom instead of getting out

375
00:33:39,836 --> 00:33:41,087
for a big surprise?

376
00:33:42,130 --> 00:33:43,466
What kind of surprise?

377
00:33:55,977 --> 00:33:57,854
- Are those...
- Surprise!

378
00:34:12,327 --> 00:34:13,329
Woo-hoo!

379
00:34:24,840 --> 00:34:28,052
- Well, that looked painful.
- Extremely.

380
00:34:30,053 --> 00:34:32,972
So, what did I do wrong?
How do you fly that thing?

381
00:34:33,014 --> 00:34:35,141
Um, you don't. You sweep with it.

382
00:34:35,851 --> 00:34:37,811
It's not a flying broom,
it's a broom broom.

383
00:34:38,311 --> 00:34:39,813
- For sweeping.
- I'm sorry?

384
00:34:39,854 --> 00:34:43,900
What exactly was the surprise
part of this "surprise"?

385
00:34:44,360 --> 00:34:47,363
I mean, Nory was surprised
when she fell on her butt.

386
00:34:48,822 --> 00:34:50,281
- Up high.
- No.

387
00:34:51,617 --> 00:34:55,329
It's a surprise because
they're exciting brand-new brooms!

388
00:34:55,371 --> 00:34:56,997
Look at that high-quality straw.

389
00:34:57,039 --> 00:34:59,041
You think that's not expensive?
And, hey!

390
00:34:59,082 --> 00:35:01,543
If it doesn't fly,
it can still take you places.

391
00:35:01,584 --> 00:35:03,838
Like, anywhere you see trash,

392
00:35:04,505 --> 00:35:08,843
you can go there, now,
and you can sweep that trash.

393
00:35:13,930 --> 00:35:17,142
You see, kids,
fluxing is all in the preparation!

394
00:35:17,642 --> 00:35:21,688
If you don't study an animal,
how can you expect to change into one?

395
00:35:21,731 --> 00:35:24,525
So for your evaluation,
we asked you to flux

396
00:35:24,566 --> 00:35:26,860
into a grey tabby kitten.

397
00:35:26,901 --> 00:35:29,112
But now, we have to go deeper.

398
00:35:29,613 --> 00:35:31,698
And you have to learn how
to flux into

399
00:35:31,740 --> 00:35:33,742
this exact kitten.

400
00:35:34,577 --> 00:35:37,412
Once you've mastered that,
then and only then

401
00:35:37,454 --> 00:35:39,039
can you advance to chickens.

402
00:35:39,289 --> 00:35:42,043
And one day, dare to dream, goats.

403
00:35:42,376 --> 00:35:45,336
Yes, indeed, goats!

404
00:35:45,378 --> 00:35:48,715
Nature's jesters! What joy! Mm.

405
00:35:50,008 --> 00:35:53,928
And remember, I´m going to give two of you
the opportunity to compete

406
00:35:54,180 --> 00:35:57,850
in the Sage Match for a spot
in the Founders´ Day presentation.

407
00:35:59,727 --> 00:36:02,480
Take a minute
with Miss Ollie Floofenstein.

408
00:36:03,439 --> 00:36:06,984
Make note of the many shapes
that make her, her.

409
00:36:08,151 --> 00:36:10,403
From the triangles of her ears

410
00:36:10,863 --> 00:36:13,366
to the ovals on the pads of her paws.

411
00:36:13,823 --> 00:36:14,825
Focus on them.

412
00:36:15,159 --> 00:36:20,164
Take a mental picture and store it
deep in your consciousness.

413
00:36:20,581 --> 00:36:21,707
Hmm?

414
00:36:23,249 --> 00:36:27,588
I'm never gonna get any better
until I can get some feline face-time!

415
00:36:36,514 --> 00:36:40,392
Nory, what are you doing here?
UDMs aren't supposed to...

416
00:36:40,434 --> 00:36:44,397
Don't mind me, just doing my part
to keep this campus spic and span!

417
00:36:44,438 --> 00:36:46,564
By sweeping the lawn?

418
00:36:46,606 --> 00:36:49,067
What can I say,
I´m very devoted to my work.

419
00:36:50,360 --> 00:36:51,945
Oh, hello!

420
00:36:52,738 --> 00:36:55,116
Say, would you mind
if I gave her a little snug?

421
00:36:56,450 --> 00:36:58,285
- Absolutely no...
- Great!

422
00:36:59,160 --> 00:37:02,289
Grey. Soft. Warm.

423
00:37:03,206 --> 00:37:04,749
Breath smells like tuna...

424
00:37:11,048 --> 00:37:12,591
Skriff! Skriff!

425
00:37:13,217 --> 00:37:15,552
Oh, jeez! Nory!

426
00:37:15,593 --> 00:37:18,930
- Skriff, if Knightslinger sees this...
- No, no, no, she won't.

427
00:37:18,972 --> 00:37:21,015
She won't. Just give me a minute. Okay?

428
00:37:21,599 --> 00:37:24,561
Hey, Nory. Breathe.

429
00:37:24,602 --> 00:37:27,939
You're safe. Okay? Just breathe.

430
00:37:28,398 --> 00:37:31,276
- You're okay.
- Look away, class.

431
00:37:31,776 --> 00:37:33,862
Think happy thoughts.
Think about goats.

432
00:37:40,077 --> 00:37:41,954
You're making me miss lunch?

433
00:37:44,122 --> 00:37:46,082
Here, dig in.

434
00:37:52,256 --> 00:37:54,675
Mealy. What a garbage day.

435
00:37:54,925 --> 00:37:58,262
Okay. You can hit the dining hall
in a few. But first,

436
00:37:58,303 --> 00:38:01,807
you and I need to have a little talk.
You know you can't do that again.

437
00:38:02,557 --> 00:38:07,854
- I know. But the thing is I wanna...
- Oh, my bad. Go ahead then.

438
00:38:08,773 --> 00:38:10,024
Except don't!

439
00:38:10,608 --> 00:38:14,570
Nory, we're trying to protect you.
You know that, right?

440
00:38:16,572 --> 00:38:18,948
Yeah. Yeah, I guess.

441
00:38:20,659 --> 00:38:24,329
- Okay. Go chow down.
- Thanks!

442
00:38:38,593 --> 00:38:39,637
Hey!

443
00:38:56,611 --> 00:38:57,613
Nory!

444
00:38:59,572 --> 00:39:02,867
Hey! I'm sorry, you want some mustard
with that?

445
00:39:03,119 --> 00:39:05,662
Yeah, that sounds good,
and a bag of chips.

446
00:39:05,912 --> 00:39:07,706
And get something nice for yourself.

447
00:39:08,999 --> 00:39:10,876
That's awesome.

448
00:39:11,293 --> 00:39:15,381
Hey, Pepper, pass the salt. Get it?

449
00:39:15,673 --> 00:39:18,718
- Never heard that one before.
- Hey, Nory?

450
00:39:22,137 --> 00:39:23,054
Yeah?

451
00:39:24,347 --> 00:39:27,142
I just gotta tell you,
that thing you turned into?

452
00:39:27,476 --> 00:39:28,977
That was like a cat,

453
00:39:29,019 --> 00:39:31,981
- and a bird, and an elephant, and...
- Wait! Hold up.

454
00:39:32,021 --> 00:39:32,898
You talk?

455
00:39:33,898 --> 00:39:35,567
When I have something to say, yeah.

456
00:39:36,401 --> 00:39:37,403
Respect.

457
00:39:38,945 --> 00:39:42,824
Anyway, Nory.
It was real cool. I dug it.

458
00:39:45,119 --> 00:39:46,245
Thanks, Andres.

459
00:39:47,121 --> 00:39:49,539
It's nice to get a little support.

460
00:39:49,581 --> 00:39:51,666
But that's the last
you're gonna see of...

461
00:39:52,501 --> 00:39:55,629
whatever I was.
I'm gonna be the perfect Fluxer for them.

462
00:39:55,671 --> 00:39:56,881
- I know it.
- How?

463
00:39:57,213 --> 00:40:00,050
They're not gonna let you near
that class or that kitten.

464
00:40:03,137 --> 00:40:06,807
"From the triangles of her ears
to the ovals on the pads of her paws."

465
00:40:07,140 --> 00:40:09,726
Whoa! These are great.
I didn't know you could draw.

466
00:40:11,896 --> 00:40:13,773
There's a lot
you don't know about me, Andres.

467
00:40:15,523 --> 00:40:19,361
No, actually, that's it. I can draw.
You know pretty much everything else.

468
00:40:20,070 --> 00:40:22,280
Anyway, I figured I can work off of this.

469
00:40:22,530 --> 00:40:24,115
You think you can draw me shooting fire

470
00:40:24,157 --> 00:40:25,575
- like a real Flare?
- Totally!

471
00:40:25,910 --> 00:40:27,578
- Or me landing?
- Sure!

472
00:40:27,994 --> 00:40:30,038
- Do not draw me.
- Okie-doke.

473
00:40:40,840 --> 00:40:44,469
- So, I decided to see...
- Hey. I think you have a fan.

474
00:40:45,930 --> 00:40:46,931
Reina!

475
00:40:48,432 --> 00:40:52,395
- Reina. We sit at the Flare table.
- But she's my best...

476
00:40:52,436 --> 00:40:55,606
She is your best opportunity
to lose focus,

477
00:40:55,648 --> 00:40:57,983
and fall even further behind.

478
00:41:10,662 --> 00:41:11,664
That's weird.

479
00:41:13,206 --> 00:41:15,917
- She didn't come over.
- 'Cause we're the loser table.

480
00:41:18,169 --> 00:41:20,130
Hey! Who threw that at me?

481
00:41:20,756 --> 00:41:23,134
Yeah, well, I got a plan.

482
00:41:24,093 --> 00:41:27,053
You know the Sage Match?
I'm going.

483
00:41:27,722 --> 00:41:29,682
Why? They're not
going to let you compete.

484
00:41:29,724 --> 00:41:33,727
I know. But, I'm gonna show them
that I can flux the right way.

485
00:41:34,186 --> 00:41:37,481
Proving that us UDMs can be taught
to do magic right!

486
00:41:38,898 --> 00:41:41,359
You know what?
Nory, I think you can do it.

487
00:41:42,360 --> 00:41:46,114
I know you can.

488
00:41:48,034 --> 00:41:50,660
- Thanks, Andres.
- Er, disgusting.

489
00:41:50,952 --> 00:41:54,831
Nory can have my sandwich,
because I have lost my appetite.

490
00:41:55,124 --> 00:41:56,542
- Up high?
- Pass.

491
00:41:56,584 --> 00:41:57,585
Come on!

492
00:43:05,870 --> 00:43:06,911
It's perfect.

493
00:43:08,372 --> 00:43:10,957
Excellent work. Have a seat.

494
00:43:12,292 --> 00:43:13,835
Now, the question is...

495
00:43:14,879 --> 00:43:17,214
who's gonna be the one
to take him on?

496
00:43:19,216 --> 00:43:22,178
Reina. Is it you?

497
00:43:55,460 --> 00:43:56,462
Okay.

498
00:43:58,172 --> 00:44:01,425
All right. This is...

499
00:44:14,230 --> 00:44:15,481
...not perfect.

500
00:44:16,189 --> 00:44:20,318
It's close,
but not as good as Phillip's.

501
00:44:21,821 --> 00:44:22,989
And honestly, Reina,

502
00:44:23,029 --> 00:44:24,823
I thought you were better
than second best.

503
00:44:26,116 --> 00:44:27,493
I guess, I was wrong.

504
00:44:39,964 --> 00:44:43,009
- Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't see you.
- I saw you...

505
00:44:44,759 --> 00:44:45,844
in class.

506
00:44:47,430 --> 00:44:51,142
- Nice work.
- Yeah. Nice work being second best.

507
00:44:51,475 --> 00:44:53,102
No. Argon lacks vision.

508
00:44:53,143 --> 00:44:55,228
I can tell you have more power
in your little finger

509
00:44:55,270 --> 00:44:56,772
than Phillip has in his whole dumb body.

510
00:44:59,274 --> 00:45:01,568
- Thank you...
- Chandra.

511
00:45:02,486 --> 00:45:05,864
And, hey, if you ever want to learn
how to harness all that power...

512
00:45:07,073 --> 00:45:08,825
I might have something that can help.

513
00:45:26,051 --> 00:45:29,262
Excuse me, ma'am, you're blocking
important sweeping business.

514
00:45:29,305 --> 00:45:31,806
- Nory!
- Hey, Reina!

515
00:45:32,308 --> 00:45:33,684
I've missed you.

516
00:45:38,480 --> 00:45:41,691
- What are you doing?
- This? It's...

517
00:45:42,359 --> 00:45:44,402
a top-secret training exercise.

518
00:45:45,029 --> 00:45:46,989
Kind of a UDM´s only kinda jam.

519
00:45:47,281 --> 00:45:49,616
We're learning stuff
that would blow your mind.

520
00:45:51,535 --> 00:45:55,122
I saw you with those other kids
at the dining hall the other day.

521
00:45:56,457 --> 00:45:58,209
It looks like you're all
really getting along.

522
00:45:59,377 --> 00:46:01,545
Yeah! Totally! It's going great!

523
00:46:02,964 --> 00:46:05,049
But enough about me,
how are you doing?

524
00:46:05,091 --> 00:46:08,094
Are you totally acing your classes?
Do you have a million cool friends?

525
00:46:08,134 --> 00:46:09,761
Does everyone know you're the coolest?

526
00:46:10,011 --> 00:46:10,930
I, um.

527
00:46:14,392 --> 00:46:15,267
I'm great.

528
00:46:16,893 --> 00:46:21,774
Everything you said. A million friends.
Acing my classes.

529
00:46:22,232 --> 00:46:25,402
Sage is everything I wanted it to be.

530
00:46:25,777 --> 00:46:27,821
I knew you'd set this place on fire.
Metaphorically.

531
00:46:29,323 --> 00:46:31,741
It sounds like you're doing amazing, too.

532
00:46:37,330 --> 00:46:39,207
- Well, I have to get back.
- Well, I have to get back.

533
00:46:41,877 --> 00:46:45,506
- See you around?
- Yeah. See you.

534
00:48:42,372 --> 00:48:43,373
Soon enough.

535
00:48:52,799 --> 00:48:54,051
One second.

536
00:48:54,301 --> 00:48:55,553
- Two.
- Come on, Nory.

537
00:48:55,593 --> 00:48:56,678
Three...

538
00:49:03,102 --> 00:49:04,437
Hey!

539
00:49:04,477 --> 00:49:06,438
What the heck is going on in there?

540
00:49:10,817 --> 00:49:12,652
- Subtle.
- Never mind.

541
00:49:12,694 --> 00:49:17,658
They don't pay me enough to care.
Also, I just generally don't care.

542
00:49:21,495 --> 00:49:24,915
- Did I hear "Four seconds"?
- No and you never will.

543
00:49:25,875 --> 00:49:28,878
- Hey, she might.
- She won't.

544
00:49:28,919 --> 00:49:32,547
No! Come on, you guys!

545
00:49:32,589 --> 00:49:35,425
I used to not be able
to hold my cat form at all!

546
00:49:35,468 --> 00:49:37,761
And now I´ve got it
for three and a half seconds!

547
00:49:37,803 --> 00:49:40,640
That's huge!
And I did that on my own!

548
00:49:43,308 --> 00:49:44,517
I'm gonna get there!

549
00:49:45,268 --> 00:49:46,270
I know it.

550
00:49:47,270 --> 00:49:51,776
I promise to you now.
I'm gonna crash the Sage Match,

551
00:49:52,484 --> 00:49:55,863
and prove to the entire faculty
that we can be taught!

552
00:49:56,196 --> 00:50:00,241
We can do things the right-side-up way!
The Sage way!

553
00:50:22,598 --> 00:50:26,268
- Guys, tonight, I know it.
- Oh! Maybe we should

554
00:50:26,310 --> 00:50:30,022
- get you some catnip.
- I never thought of catnip.

555
00:50:32,692 --> 00:50:34,777
She's doing great without me.

556
00:51:09,477 --> 00:51:12,772
"Manifesting your untapped power."

557
00:52:21,216 --> 00:52:23,426
- Good luck in there.
- Thanks.

558
00:52:23,468 --> 00:52:24,552
You're gonna need it.

559
00:52:30,685 --> 00:52:32,937
And he huffed, and he puffed,

560
00:52:33,520 --> 00:52:36,564
but the wolf couldn't blow
the brick house down.

561
00:52:37,190 --> 00:52:38,942
What happened to him after that?

562
00:52:38,984 --> 00:52:42,195
Well, that is inconclusive.

563
00:52:42,238 --> 00:52:44,156
The end.

564
00:52:47,576 --> 00:52:53,040
Mm. Riveting stuff, Elliot. Okay, Nory.
You're next.

565
00:52:55,250 --> 00:52:56,459
Nory!

566
00:52:57,712 --> 00:52:59,171
Let's go!

567
00:53:04,593 --> 00:53:05,969
Where's Nory?

568
00:53:06,011 --> 00:53:09,055
- Nory who?
- Yeah, which one of us is she?

569
00:53:09,306 --> 00:53:10,390
Never heard of her.

570
00:53:11,600 --> 00:53:13,518
She hasn't been here the whole time,
has she?

571
00:53:15,062 --> 00:53:18,107
Hey! Where is she?

572
00:53:21,402 --> 00:53:24,572
Look, Nory's doing it for us, okay?
She wants to prove to the whole school

573
00:53:24,613 --> 00:53:26,323
that we can learn real magic.

574
00:53:27,658 --> 00:53:29,535
Prove it how?

575
00:53:37,917 --> 00:53:41,338
- She's going to crash the Sage Match.
- Oh. Great.

576
00:53:41,839 --> 00:53:45,217
Okay, everyone, stay here.

577
00:53:59,814 --> 00:54:03,276
Let the Sage Match begin!

578
00:54:10,493 --> 00:54:14,205
Flares! Phillip, Reina, you're up!

579
00:54:24,047 --> 00:54:25,006
Begin.

580
00:54:34,975 --> 00:54:36,643
- Done!
- What?

581
00:54:37,852 --> 00:54:39,020
Come forward.

582
00:55:01,794 --> 00:55:06,089
- She did it!
- Reina, you will represent the Flares!

583
00:55:11,594 --> 00:55:15,890
- Next! Let us bring up the Flyers.
- Stop the presses!

584
00:55:16,642 --> 00:55:19,687
Oh, Nory, hooray.
My day is complete.

585
00:55:19,728 --> 00:55:21,814
- You! Get out!
- No.

586
00:55:23,649 --> 00:55:27,152
I have been practicing,
and I know I can do this.

587
00:55:27,652 --> 00:55:30,406
I can follow the Sage way.
I can be the exact kitten

588
00:55:30,448 --> 00:55:32,074
you want for the exact amount of time.

589
00:55:33,491 --> 00:55:35,745
I know you think
I have zero potential, but...

590
00:55:36,578 --> 00:55:38,997
I'm here to tell you
that you are wrong.

591
00:55:39,372 --> 00:55:41,791
All want is for you
to give me a chance.

592
00:55:43,294 --> 00:55:47,422
But, if you say no,
I will respect that.

593
00:55:47,797 --> 00:55:49,799
- No.
- I lied!

594
00:56:08,069 --> 00:56:10,154
One. Two.

595
00:56:10,196 --> 00:56:11,238
- Nory!
- Nory!

596
00:56:11,279 --> 00:56:12,573
- Nory!
- Nory!

597
00:56:12,614 --> 00:56:13,616
Three.

598
00:56:13,908 --> 00:56:15,116
- Nory!
- Nory!

599
00:56:15,368 --> 00:56:17,119
Four...

600
00:56:38,390 --> 00:56:40,475
Somebody do something!

601
00:56:41,310 --> 00:56:45,189
Sparkle fire ball. It's her favorite.
Maybe it'll help!

602
00:57:00,830 --> 00:57:01,872
What's happening?

603
00:57:02,998 --> 00:57:04,125
What is this?

604
00:57:12,299 --> 00:57:13,551
Nory.

605
00:57:14,384 --> 00:57:17,430
I'm so sorry. Are you okay?
I don't know what happened.

606
00:57:17,805 --> 00:57:19,306
I don't know what that was.

607
00:57:19,348 --> 00:57:22,518
- I really didn't mean to...
- Reina, I'm okay. It's okay.

608
00:57:23,268 --> 00:57:24,270
Are you sure you're okay?

609
00:57:25,603 --> 00:57:26,772
Skriff.

610
00:57:26,814 --> 00:57:30,901
How many times do we have to tell you
to keep your charges in the bunker

611
00:57:30,942 --> 00:57:32,319
where they belong!

612
00:57:33,029 --> 00:57:36,407
The only reason we're not expelling you
this instant

613
00:57:36,448 --> 00:57:39,242
is because we need to keep you here
to protect the world

614
00:57:39,285 --> 00:57:40,870
from your wonky magic!

615
00:57:40,910 --> 00:57:44,164
Hey, with all due respect,
I think she gets it.

616
00:57:44,915 --> 00:57:48,960
As for you, Skriff.
If any of the UDMs

617
00:57:49,002 --> 00:57:52,422
are caught practicing magic again,
you will be terminated!

618
00:57:54,049 --> 00:57:56,384
- I'll lose my job?
- If you're lucky.

619
00:57:56,426 --> 00:57:59,471
And don't even think
about attending Founders´ Day!

620
00:57:59,513 --> 00:58:01,641
The UDMs are banned!

621
00:58:08,355 --> 00:58:09,397
Come on.

622
00:58:20,493 --> 00:58:22,953
Guys. Guys, say something.

623
00:58:23,870 --> 00:58:26,414
Andres? Pepper?

624
00:58:28,375 --> 00:58:29,377
Elliot?

625
00:58:31,169 --> 00:58:33,463
Come on, fam,
what's with the silent treatment?

626
00:58:35,591 --> 00:58:36,968
Wow. Some friends!

627
00:58:37,009 --> 00:58:39,887
I'm practically smothered
from all of this kindness and support,

628
00:58:39,928 --> 00:58:43,431
- after the worst day of my entire life!
- You got our hopes up, Nory.

629
00:58:43,683 --> 00:58:44,684
Not mine.

630
00:58:47,018 --> 00:58:50,147
Okay, mine. But I hated feeling hopeful.

631
00:58:50,522 --> 00:58:53,733
You told us we wouldn't have
to hide in a bunker

632
00:58:53,776 --> 00:58:56,529
- until we just ran out of magic.
- But you were wrong.

633
00:58:56,821 --> 00:58:58,698
We're always gonna be upside down.

634
00:58:58,739 --> 00:59:01,867
Yeah. At least until we're just nothing.

635
00:59:02,701 --> 00:59:05,412
- Just people.
- Accountants. Dog groomers.

636
00:59:05,955 --> 00:59:07,915
That's why the silent treatment.

637
00:59:08,415 --> 00:59:09,959
Get used to it.

638
00:59:12,294 --> 00:59:14,212
I honestly thought
it was gonna work out.

639
00:59:14,254 --> 00:59:16,339
Because I always think things
are gonna work out.

640
00:59:17,841 --> 00:59:19,509
Now I know they won't and...

641
00:59:20,761 --> 00:59:21,762
I´m sorry.

642
00:59:22,596 --> 00:59:24,931
- I'm sorry I let you down.
- Okay.

643
00:59:24,973 --> 00:59:26,808
Butts outta seats!

644
00:59:27,393 --> 00:59:31,105
Come on!
Butts minus seats equals you.

645
00:59:31,814 --> 00:59:34,399
- Math!
- Where are we going?

646
00:59:34,942 --> 00:59:37,236
On a date with destiny.

647
00:59:42,116 --> 00:59:46,120
Outside. We're just going outside.
It's nice out. Come on!

648
00:59:49,665 --> 00:59:52,585
Okay. So, Nory apologized to all of you,
right?

649
00:59:52,627 --> 00:59:54,962
But what exactly did she do wrong?

650
00:59:55,629 --> 00:59:58,089
Hmm? I'll tell ya.

651
00:59:59,466 --> 01:00:01,468
She dared to think she could be more

652
01:00:01,509 --> 01:00:04,430
than what Sage told her she was.
A UDM.

653
01:00:05,096 --> 01:00:06,848
A hard-luck case with broken magic.

654
01:00:07,140 --> 01:00:09,643
A useless anomaly
to be forced into the darkness,

655
01:00:09,685 --> 01:00:11,395
never to be thought of again.

656
01:00:11,437 --> 01:00:14,357
And I sat there at my desk,
and I let her apologize to you.

657
01:00:14,899 --> 01:00:18,527
When, like, really,
I should have been the one apologizing.

658
01:00:18,819 --> 01:00:21,322
- Why should you apologize?
- Yeah,

659
01:00:21,364 --> 01:00:23,324
- you're just doing your job.
- Sort of.

660
01:00:24,991 --> 01:00:26,076
My job...

661
01:00:27,035 --> 01:00:28,745
My job for years

662
01:00:29,080 --> 01:00:32,500
has been to watch class after class
of UDMs come here,

663
01:00:32,959 --> 01:00:36,754
get their dreams squashed,
and leave here broken.

664
01:00:39,131 --> 01:00:41,926
And I have hated every second of it.

665
01:00:43,343 --> 01:00:45,428
- But you kept doing it.
- I did.

666
01:00:46,138 --> 01:00:49,475
Because Sage made me feel like
I had nothing to offer.

667
01:00:49,725 --> 01:00:52,520
But as long as I did what they said,
I could stay here.

668
01:00:52,770 --> 01:00:54,522
But I can't do that anymore.

669
01:00:57,692 --> 01:00:59,110
That ends today.

670
01:01:00,027 --> 01:01:03,406
And that ends today because of Nory.

671
01:01:03,864 --> 01:01:08,119
For the first time in
a lot of years, Nory, you...

672
01:01:08,868 --> 01:01:10,787
you made me a believer.

673
01:01:11,622 --> 01:01:14,375
You made me believe that UDMs

674
01:01:14,417 --> 01:01:17,252
could be more than what Sage
tells them. So much more.

675
01:01:17,294 --> 01:01:19,171
How? With my stupid magic?

676
01:01:19,422 --> 01:01:22,341
Dude. There is nothing stupid
or upside down

677
01:01:22,382 --> 01:01:24,093
- about your magic.
- But Sage...

678
01:01:24,134 --> 01:01:28,221
Exactly, Sage. Sage told you
your magic is upside down.

679
01:01:28,263 --> 01:01:29,973
But do you actually think that?

680
01:01:30,433 --> 01:01:34,645
Any of you. Nory,
when you first discovered your powers,

681
01:01:34,895 --> 01:01:38,733
were you like, "Oh, nuts, I can do magic,
but it's wrong."

682
01:01:40,067 --> 01:01:45,072
No! I thought, "I can do magic,
and that's cool as heck."

683
01:01:45,989 --> 01:01:48,241
And I still think that.
Even if it's wonky.

684
01:01:48,283 --> 01:01:50,535
Even if it's upside down.
Even if it doesn't fit in with...

685
01:01:50,995 --> 01:01:54,080
- "The Sage way."
- ...the Sage way.

686
01:01:56,000 --> 01:01:58,460
I'm never gonna be magic
the Sage way.

687
01:01:59,169 --> 01:02:02,756
Never ever.
None of us are. And you know what?

688
01:02:04,424 --> 01:02:06,760
I don't care.

689
01:02:07,594 --> 01:02:09,430
I can be magic my way.

690
01:02:09,471 --> 01:02:12,432
We all can!
We can all be magic our way.

691
01:02:12,475 --> 01:02:16,103
Yes! You guys all have amazing powers.

692
01:02:16,145 --> 01:02:19,815
You just have to learn how to harness them
and master them.

693
01:02:19,857 --> 01:02:22,526
Yeah? And who's gonna teach us that?

694
01:02:22,942 --> 01:02:27,281
Well, I don't really see anyone else here,
so, I guess...

695
01:02:27,989 --> 01:02:28,950
me?

696
01:02:30,743 --> 01:02:32,745
Sorry, um, you?

697
01:02:34,120 --> 01:02:38,084
Yeah, I mean, you're great at raking

698
01:02:38,125 --> 01:02:40,419
and letting us chew gum in class...

699
01:02:40,460 --> 01:02:42,754
But what can you teach us
about magic?

700
01:02:44,172 --> 01:02:46,801
You know what?
Valid concerns, all of those.

701
01:02:48,843 --> 01:02:49,886
Let me show you something.

702
01:02:55,100 --> 01:02:58,061
Calling all creatures

703
01:02:58,645 --> 01:03:01,524
Feathered, fluffy, furry, fuzzy

704
01:03:01,564 --> 01:03:05,026
They all wanna meet ya

705
01:03:05,069 --> 01:03:07,989
Now we're talking, chirping, squawking

706
01:03:08,029 --> 01:03:10,783
You see, I can teach y'all

707
01:03:11,158 --> 01:03:16,455
And now you all know why

708
01:03:18,957 --> 01:03:21,418
Wait, you're a Fuzzy?

709
01:03:21,460 --> 01:03:24,839
Uh. Correction. I'm an upside-down Fuzzy.

710
01:03:25,672 --> 01:03:28,633
Check it out.
Hey, dude, get off my shoulder.

711
01:03:31,928 --> 01:03:35,223
Get off my shoulder

712
01:03:35,265 --> 01:03:40,562
Now it's time to fly

713
01:03:42,480 --> 01:03:45,984
See, the Sage way to be a Fuzzy
does not involve dope jams.

714
01:03:46,277 --> 01:03:50,156
But it is my way to be a Fuzzy,
and if I say so myself,

715
01:03:50,196 --> 01:03:51,489
it is dynamite.

716
01:03:51,531 --> 01:03:54,035
Wait, so your magic
didn't fade after a year?

717
01:03:54,076 --> 01:03:57,038
Let me explain.
See, I came to Sage as an orphan.

718
01:03:57,538 --> 01:04:01,834
And knowing I had nobody to go home to,
Sage let me stay on and groundskeep.

719
01:04:02,209 --> 01:04:06,339
Eventually they let me work with the UDMs,
'cause, you know,

720
01:04:06,379 --> 01:04:08,882
it takes a weirdo to teach a weirdo.
No offense, weirdos.

721
01:04:08,924 --> 01:04:10,176
None taken.

722
01:04:10,759 --> 01:04:13,428
- But you didn't answer Nory´s question.
- Up high.

723
01:04:15,013 --> 01:04:18,517
- She gets one? Come on!
- You know what?

724
01:04:18,558 --> 01:04:21,853
Let's just say I manage
to practice my magic on the sly.

725
01:04:22,687 --> 01:04:25,607
It keeps me from fully losing
what few marbles I got left.

726
01:04:25,649 --> 01:04:27,942
Anyway, you guys
head back to the bunks,

727
01:04:28,361 --> 01:04:32,948
chill out and get some rest.
Tomorrow, we get to work.

728
01:04:39,788 --> 01:04:41,040
Hey, you okay?

729
01:04:41,790 --> 01:04:44,876
Today started awful,
and then it got way better.

730
01:04:45,335 --> 01:04:47,296
- But...
- But?

731
01:04:47,672 --> 01:04:49,423
My best friend, Reina?

732
01:04:50,341 --> 01:04:53,719
- Her magic was weird at the Sage Match.
- Weird how?

733
01:04:54,011 --> 01:04:56,180
Just, like different, more intense.

734
01:04:56,681 --> 01:04:58,099
- Oh, well, I'm sure...
- I mean,

735
01:04:58,140 --> 01:05:00,893
she's probably been working
really hard to sharpen her powers.

736
01:05:01,227 --> 01:05:03,270
I guess they probably are different.

737
01:05:03,603 --> 01:05:06,357
- Yeah, totally.
- I could just go talk to her about it.

738
01:05:06,607 --> 01:05:08,109
- You could...
- I will.

739
01:05:08,401 --> 01:05:11,569
Thanks for helping me out, Andres!
You give really good advice.

740
01:05:14,323 --> 01:05:15,449
Glad I could help.

741
01:05:29,129 --> 01:05:31,381
Good evening.

742
01:05:32,382 --> 01:05:33,676
What are you doing here?

743
01:05:33,718 --> 01:05:35,844
I just wanted to offer my congratulations.

744
01:05:36,136 --> 01:05:39,180
On winning the Sage Match,
and on the ensuing...

745
01:05:40,223 --> 01:05:41,225
fireworks.

746
01:05:42,685 --> 01:05:43,811
What was that?

747
01:05:45,353 --> 01:05:47,564
I could have killed my friend!

748
01:05:47,605 --> 01:05:51,192
Well, the thing about this particular book
of magic is it's not really an...

749
01:05:51,902 --> 01:05:53,279
"a la carte" situation.

750
01:05:55,448 --> 01:05:57,616
You can't pick just one thing from it.

751
01:05:58,951 --> 01:06:00,453
Not without some...

752
01:06:01,203 --> 01:06:02,330
side effects.

753
01:06:08,377 --> 01:06:09,378
Get out!

754
01:06:11,129 --> 01:06:12,589
And take the book with you.

755
01:06:27,020 --> 01:06:28,814
I said take the book!

756
01:06:30,857 --> 01:06:34,152
You did. Just now. Real loud.

757
01:06:38,114 --> 01:06:40,700
Hey, hey, Reina!

758
01:06:41,618 --> 01:06:43,203
Wait, you're not supposed to be in here.

759
01:06:43,703 --> 01:06:46,707
I mean, technically I´m not supposed to be
anywhere.

760
01:06:46,748 --> 01:06:48,417
Okay, what's up? Can I come in?

761
01:06:49,919 --> 01:06:53,506
Uh, I'm tired. It's been a long day.
I need to sleep.

762
01:06:53,881 --> 01:06:55,549
We'll catch up later, I promise.

763
01:06:55,591 --> 01:06:56,968
- But...
- Nory, go.

764
01:06:59,053 --> 01:07:01,388
- Please.
- Okay, but...

765
01:07:23,260 --> 01:07:27,305
So, in order to sharpen our magic
we need to turn ourselves into pretzels?

766
01:07:27,847 --> 01:07:30,517
Well, sort of. Here's the thing,

767
01:07:30,767 --> 01:07:33,646
I've been observing this school's
training techniques for years.

768
01:07:33,687 --> 01:07:36,982
And it's fine, for them.
But in my noggin,

769
01:07:37,274 --> 01:07:40,026
I´ve been coming up
with a counter-curriculum for UDMs.

770
01:07:41,403 --> 01:07:42,655
Stuff like this...

771
01:07:43,071 --> 01:07:46,117
- is a big part of it.
- Why?

772
01:07:46,158 --> 01:07:47,993
Because, we gotta focus all that

773
01:07:48,368 --> 01:07:50,954
jiggety-jaggety puberty energy
you guys have.

774
01:07:51,539 --> 01:07:54,249
Control your bodies, control your powers.

775
01:07:55,126 --> 01:07:56,209
Now...

776
01:08:01,256 --> 01:08:02,383
...focus on your power.

777
01:08:03,508 --> 01:08:05,260
Picture it in your mind's eye.

778
01:08:05,303 --> 01:08:08,888
And picture it doing exactly
what you want it to do.

779
01:08:10,515 --> 01:08:13,602
Elliot, what do you want your power
to do?

780
01:08:13,644 --> 01:08:16,396
I want to be able to shoot fire
like the other Flares.

781
01:08:16,646 --> 01:08:17,981
Okay, well, you can't.

782
01:08:18,024 --> 01:08:20,610
It's like asking an orange
to be a pickup truck.

783
01:08:20,650 --> 01:08:22,611
It ain't gonna happen, right?
But...

784
01:08:22,986 --> 01:08:25,239
what do you want your power to do?

785
01:08:28,868 --> 01:08:32,913
I guess, I want to be able to control it.

786
01:08:33,497 --> 01:08:36,499
Like, make smoke go
where I want it to go?

787
01:08:36,542 --> 01:08:38,753
Yes! Fam, you see that?

788
01:08:38,793 --> 01:08:42,506
Don't focus on what you can't do.
Focus on what you can do.

789
01:08:42,547 --> 01:08:45,175
And do it as well as you possibly can.

790
01:08:46,135 --> 01:08:47,093
Pepper.

791
01:08:48,095 --> 01:08:51,682
I wanna be able to push things away
from me when I wanna.

792
01:08:52,432 --> 01:08:55,310
- Like you.
- Oh. Right.

793
01:08:55,727 --> 01:08:58,647
You know what? That's perfect.
We can do that.

794
01:08:59,105 --> 01:09:00,065
Nory.

795
01:09:00,106 --> 01:09:02,818
I want to be able to choose what animal
I flux into.

796
01:09:02,860 --> 01:09:06,614
- Oh, come on, animal?
- Sorry. Animals.

797
01:09:06,655 --> 01:09:07,781
Boom!

798
01:09:08,490 --> 01:09:09,492
Andres.

799
01:09:12,119 --> 01:09:13,120
My man!

800
01:09:13,995 --> 01:09:16,873
- I don't know.
- Okay. Well, you know what?

801
01:09:17,458 --> 01:09:20,169
Be with that for now.
Embrace the uncertainty.

802
01:09:20,418 --> 01:09:24,089
Because I have got a plan for you.
I promise.

803
01:09:33,848 --> 01:09:37,727
This is your plan? A hose?
A hose is your plan?

804
01:09:37,770 --> 01:09:41,232
It's a prelude to a plan.
Okay? Let me ask you this.

805
01:09:41,481 --> 01:09:44,484
Have you ever just tried
to see how far up you go?

806
01:09:44,776 --> 01:09:45,735
No.

807
01:09:45,778 --> 01:09:49,656
Look, my mom told me that if I didn't
have my bag, I´d just fly away into space,

808
01:09:49,699 --> 01:09:51,951
and be gone forever,
and I'd get sucked into a black hole,

809
01:09:51,993 --> 01:09:55,870
- and my eyes would pop out of my head...
- Your mom has a really vivid imagination.

810
01:09:55,913 --> 01:09:58,833
Now. Hear me out.
Drop the bag.

811
01:10:00,543 --> 01:10:02,169
I... I can't.

812
01:10:02,211 --> 01:10:05,881
Um, counterpoint, you totally can.

813
01:10:07,675 --> 01:10:09,051
You got this.

814
01:10:09,802 --> 01:10:10,928
Okay.

815
01:10:32,908 --> 01:10:37,538
- Whoo! This is amazing!
- Okay. I'm letting go.

816
01:10:42,501 --> 01:10:43,543
Hey!

817
01:10:46,087 --> 01:10:47,130
Whoo!

818
01:10:48,673 --> 01:10:51,092
I'm not in space!
My eyes are still in my head!

819
01:10:51,135 --> 01:10:53,846
Yeah, they sure are!
And, hey, I hope you know!

820
01:10:53,887 --> 01:10:57,515
That's faster than any Flyer
can launch, Rocket-boy!

821
01:10:57,934 --> 01:10:59,101
I do now!

822
01:10:59,435 --> 01:11:01,729
I love it! That's me! Rocket-boy!

823
01:11:01,770 --> 01:11:04,856
Okay, so, the thing we're gonna work on
with you,

824
01:11:04,899 --> 01:11:07,068
is controlling all that launch power.

825
01:11:07,610 --> 01:11:09,403
- Sound good?
- Sounds great!

826
01:11:09,904 --> 01:11:13,366
- Uh, can you help me get down?
- Yeah, right.

827
01:11:29,214 --> 01:11:33,468
If I didn't know any better,
which I do, I´d say

828
01:11:33,511 --> 01:11:36,513
you're making me rake while you
lean against that tree and do nothing.

829
01:11:36,555 --> 01:11:40,017
I mean, I would do it,
but you're real good with that rake.

830
01:11:40,059 --> 01:11:42,102
Like, you push the leaves with it,

831
01:11:42,144 --> 01:11:45,481
and the leaves go
where you want them to go.

832
01:11:51,153 --> 01:11:53,030
I bet there's an easier way to do it.

833
01:12:09,046 --> 01:12:10,172
No!

834
01:12:11,548 --> 01:12:13,466
Not quite there yet.

835
01:12:21,516 --> 01:12:25,061
Okay, they've been wanting me to get rid
of this beehive for, like, a minute.

836
01:12:25,104 --> 01:12:26,646
So, here's the plan.

837
01:12:26,689 --> 01:12:29,691
I'm gonna knock it down,
and then you're gonna smoke 'em out.

838
01:12:29,734 --> 01:12:33,195
- I am? When?
- Right about...

839
01:12:35,364 --> 01:12:36,324
now!

840
01:12:38,450 --> 01:12:42,413
- Oh, close. Really close.
- What about the bees?

841
01:12:44,623 --> 01:12:49,586
Bees, let me offer my apologies

842
01:12:50,546 --> 01:12:52,173
But we need you

843
01:12:52,213 --> 01:12:56,927
To find another hive

844
01:12:56,968 --> 01:12:59,721
And we thank you in advance

845
01:12:59,763 --> 01:13:05,060
Bye-bye

846
01:13:22,912 --> 01:13:24,997
Exactly how many of these things
do I have to do?

847
01:13:25,413 --> 01:13:28,917
- Um, like, a million zillion.
- But it's so boring.

848
01:13:28,959 --> 01:13:30,711
OMG, I know.

849
01:13:30,753 --> 01:13:33,089
I mean, it's almost like you're learning
how to visualize

850
01:13:33,129 --> 01:13:36,467
and physically manifest
animal combinations.

851
01:13:38,427 --> 01:13:39,470
Touché.

852
01:13:39,887 --> 01:13:42,431
Here, take a break.
The dritten can wait.

853
01:13:42,472 --> 01:13:44,391
Wait, what's a dritten?

854
01:13:45,267 --> 01:13:48,354
A dragon-kitten, dritten.

855
01:13:49,271 --> 01:13:53,734
- Dritten. I like it.
- Yeah, this is a dritten.

856
01:13:54,193 --> 01:13:55,820
That's a kittiphant.

857
01:13:56,153 --> 01:13:57,780
That's a sharkitten,
and so on.

858
01:13:57,821 --> 01:14:01,367
Like, the more you can see
and know and name these things,

859
01:14:01,409 --> 01:14:03,953
the more you can fully be them. Right?

860
01:14:04,829 --> 01:14:05,830
Right.

861
01:14:06,830 --> 01:14:09,874
Dritten. Dritten. Dritten. Dritten.

862
01:14:10,418 --> 01:14:13,587
Oh, no
What's going on here

863
01:14:13,628 --> 01:14:16,506
My world is turned around
And I'm upside down

864
01:14:16,548 --> 01:14:19,510
Like, oh, oh, right out of nowhere...

865
01:14:19,552 --> 01:14:20,553
What?

866
01:14:20,595 --> 01:14:23,681
My feet are up off the ground
And I'm upside down...

867
01:14:23,722 --> 01:14:24,890
Nice!

868
01:14:24,931 --> 01:14:28,310
All of a sudden the bottom floor
Is the top floor

869
01:14:28,351 --> 01:14:31,439
The top floor beneath my feet
And man it feels so low

870
01:14:31,480 --> 01:14:34,775
Everything's changing
This situation's taking me on a ride

871
01:14:35,150 --> 01:14:38,738
All over, around now, chasing me down
And I got no place to hide

872
01:14:38,779 --> 01:14:40,196
If everyone could walk...

873
01:14:40,239 --> 01:14:41,824
Because you're wonky.

874
01:14:42,074 --> 01:14:45,828
The king of that world no one would dare
To knock on my door botherin' me

875
01:14:45,869 --> 01:14:49,372
I'm feelin' the speed
Been feeling this H-E-A-T

876
01:14:49,414 --> 01:14:53,252
Inevitable, it's out of control
Turning me inside out and upside down

877
01:14:53,502 --> 01:14:56,464
Oh, no
What's going on here

878
01:14:56,504 --> 01:14:59,633
My world has turned around
And I'm upside down

879
01:14:59,675 --> 01:15:01,927
Like, oh, oh

880
01:15:01,968 --> 01:15:04,012
Right outta nowhere

881
01:15:04,055 --> 01:15:08,184
My feet are up off the ground
And I'm upside down now

882
01:15:08,225 --> 01:15:11,437
Knocked down, right down
Down, down, down

883
01:15:11,479 --> 01:15:15,024
Smacked down, right down
Down, down, down

884
01:15:15,065 --> 01:15:18,443
Man down, man down
Down, down, down

885
01:15:18,485 --> 01:15:22,155
So, turn around right now
Down, down, down

886
01:15:22,198 --> 01:15:24,825
My world's flipped inside and out
I've been in a cloud, but now

887
01:15:24,867 --> 01:15:27,328
Instead of livin' it up
I'm livin' it down

888
01:15:27,578 --> 01:15:29,538
Looked as a clown
The frown I've caused

889
01:15:29,872 --> 01:15:31,582
Assume you're the king
Then do a few things

890
01:15:31,623 --> 01:15:32,958
Don't think there's a price to pay

891
01:15:32,999 --> 01:15:36,294
But look at me now, I've been in a cage
And put my life on delay

892
01:15:44,302 --> 01:15:45,637
- Meow!
- Meow!

893
01:15:52,061 --> 01:15:54,397
Upside down now

894
01:15:54,437 --> 01:15:58,150
Knocked down, right down
Down, down, down

895
01:15:58,191 --> 01:16:01,611
Smacked down, right down
Down, down, down

896
01:16:01,654 --> 01:16:05,156
Man down, man down
Down, down, down...

897
01:16:05,199 --> 01:16:08,703
So turn around right now
Down, down, down

898
01:16:17,962 --> 01:16:20,881
- You're better than all of them, you know.
- Go away.

899
01:16:20,922 --> 01:16:24,510
I'm afraid I can't do that.
You already used my book.

900
01:16:25,802 --> 01:16:29,265
You're stuck with me.
So why fight it?

901
01:16:32,142 --> 01:16:35,395
Just look at these fools
with their parlor tricks.

902
01:16:36,105 --> 01:16:41,068
Writing their names. Popping corn.
Sparkly fireballs.

903
01:16:42,360 --> 01:16:43,988
You team up with me...

904
01:16:45,489 --> 01:16:47,783
we can have real power.

905
01:16:49,702 --> 01:16:52,204
- Just say the word.
- No! I said go away!

906
01:16:53,163 --> 01:16:57,917
- Hey, Reina, are you okay?
- Chandra! She won't leave me alone!

907
01:16:58,336 --> 01:16:59,419
Who's Chandra?

908
01:16:59,462 --> 01:17:01,756
What do you mean, "Who's Chandra?"
She's right here!

909
01:17:03,132 --> 01:17:05,885
- There's... There's nobody there.
- What?

910
01:17:06,385 --> 01:17:08,512
I forgot to tell you, Reina...

911
01:17:09,680 --> 01:17:12,016
you're the only one who can see me.

912
01:17:20,315 --> 01:17:22,275
I'm gonna go.

913
01:17:45,591 --> 01:17:49,345
Stop! Stop running from your destiny.

914
01:17:49,387 --> 01:17:53,474
- What do you want from me?
- I want you to know your worth, Reina.

915
01:17:56,601 --> 01:17:58,729
You don't think you're good enough,
do you?

916
01:17:59,605 --> 01:18:04,318
You think everyone here is better than you
and you are wrong.

917
01:18:07,029 --> 01:18:09,323
Reginald thought
he wasn't good enough either.

918
01:18:10,490 --> 01:18:14,744
- Who?
- A former Flare. A former friend.

919
01:18:15,538 --> 01:18:20,126
He was very insecure,
but he was very powerful.

920
01:18:21,584 --> 01:18:26,214
You are even more insecure,
but even more powerful.

921
01:18:27,382 --> 01:18:31,636
He was good. But you, Reina...

922
01:18:33,513 --> 01:18:35,391
are perfect.

923
01:18:37,351 --> 01:18:42,607
Yes, good, smile,
revel in your perfection.

924
01:18:43,106 --> 01:18:45,359
Everyone will know of it soon.

925
01:18:50,196 --> 01:18:52,783
- What's happening?
- You are.

926
01:18:54,034 --> 01:18:55,952
Whether you know it or not,

927
01:18:55,994 --> 01:18:58,913
you are accepting the shadow magic
into you.

928
01:18:59,748 --> 01:19:05,295
You are tired of hiding in the shadows,
when you can be the shadow.

929
01:19:05,587 --> 01:19:06,588
Say it.

930
01:19:07,672 --> 01:19:09,215
Say you're tired.

931
01:19:10,133 --> 01:19:13,346
- I'm tired!
- Then wake up.

932
01:19:20,144 --> 01:19:23,271
Hey! Sparkplugs!
Any of you seen Reina?

933
01:19:23,689 --> 01:19:27,318
Well! If it isn't the UDM
who nearly destroyed the Founders Hall

934
01:19:27,360 --> 01:19:30,196
by turning into some kind
of crazy monster.

935
01:19:31,029 --> 01:19:35,158
Yeah, and I was in a good mood.
But now, I´m in a bad mood.

936
01:19:36,409 --> 01:19:38,244
- She went that way.
- Thanks.

937
01:19:50,591 --> 01:19:53,468
- We are awake.
- Reina!

938
01:19:58,641 --> 01:20:00,810
We are not Reina.

939
01:20:01,769 --> 01:20:06,440
We are the thing
that has been waiting all these years.

940
01:20:07,732 --> 01:20:09,110
Shadow magic.

941
01:20:09,150 --> 01:20:12,613
- So you don't only prey on UDMs.
- Of course not.

942
01:20:14,406 --> 01:20:17,827
But soon we will prey on everyone.

943
01:20:18,910 --> 01:20:22,539
We will bring this entire school
to its knees.

944
01:20:23,958 --> 01:20:25,293
But for now...

945
01:20:26,668 --> 01:20:29,379
we will start with you!

946
01:20:33,592 --> 01:20:38,180
- Reina, I'm gonna save you. I promise.
- We do not need saving!

947
01:20:49,065 --> 01:20:51,068
C'mon, dorks, tell me where she went.

948
01:20:51,110 --> 01:20:53,696
If anyone from the school
sees her out there after curfew,

949
01:20:53,738 --> 01:20:54,905
we're all hosed.

950
01:20:54,946 --> 01:20:57,783
- How'd you even know she snuck out?
- Um, a little bird told me.

951
01:20:58,034 --> 01:21:00,786
Literally. His name's Todd.
Todd the little bird.

952
01:21:00,828 --> 01:21:04,415
Skriff! Reina! Shadow magic, the school.

953
01:21:04,457 --> 01:21:06,167
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Slow down.

954
01:21:06,542 --> 01:21:09,337
My best friend Reina
has been acting weird,

955
01:21:09,378 --> 01:21:13,090
and her magic wasn't hers.
But it's because the shadow magic got her.

956
01:21:13,132 --> 01:21:15,635
And she said it's gonna bring
the entire school to its knees!

957
01:21:17,802 --> 01:21:18,803
Wow.

958
01:21:20,431 --> 01:21:21,848
No way.

959
01:21:27,437 --> 01:21:28,897
- Well?
- I'm thinking.

960
01:21:28,940 --> 01:21:31,232
And it's been a minute
since I´ve done that,

961
01:21:31,275 --> 01:21:33,736
- so I would appreciate the patience.
- Let's get out there and stop it!

962
01:21:34,195 --> 01:21:36,572
It's probably destroying the school
right now! Come on!

963
01:21:38,990 --> 01:21:41,243
No. You guys...

964
01:21:44,038 --> 01:21:45,623
- it's waiting.
- For what?

965
01:21:45,914 --> 01:21:48,333
For when it can do the most damage.

966
01:21:52,712 --> 01:21:57,133
French bread pizza day!

967
01:21:59,052 --> 01:22:02,390
What? It's like the most popular day
at the dining hall!

968
01:22:02,431 --> 01:22:05,101
Everyone loves French bread pizza!

969
01:22:05,141 --> 01:22:07,227
- I mean, it is really good.
- Fresh basil.

970
01:22:07,270 --> 01:22:08,771
- They know what they're doing.
- Yeah.

971
01:22:10,439 --> 01:22:11,399
Founders´ Day.

972
01:22:12,650 --> 01:22:13,693
Boom.

973
01:22:13,734 --> 01:22:16,946
Founders´ Day is tomorrow. We go
to Knightslinger right now and tell her.

974
01:22:16,988 --> 01:22:18,114
Tell her what, exactly?

975
01:22:18,154 --> 01:22:20,865
You think she's gonna believe you,
after everything you've pulled?

976
01:22:20,908 --> 01:22:24,245
Because I know she won't.
Then nobody will be able to help you.

977
01:22:24,287 --> 01:22:27,373
- So, what can we do?
- We can get some rest.

978
01:22:27,707 --> 01:22:31,377
We need to make darn sure we're ready
for anything tomorrow. Okay?

979
01:22:31,711 --> 01:22:32,878
- Okay!
- Okay!

980
01:22:48,019 --> 01:22:49,895
What a beautiful morning.

981
01:22:56,026 --> 01:22:57,778
They'll never see it coming.

982
01:23:02,699 --> 01:23:07,162
Okay. Well, I guess this is the part
where I should probably...

983
01:23:08,163 --> 01:23:10,749
say something inspiring. So, um...

984
01:23:13,209 --> 01:23:14,919
something inspiring.

985
01:23:17,839 --> 01:23:21,677
Did you mean to say that you believe
in each and every one of us,

986
01:23:21,718 --> 01:23:24,430
and that as long as we have faith
in ourselves, and each other,

987
01:23:24,471 --> 01:23:26,139
there's no evil we can't conquer?

988
01:23:27,391 --> 01:23:28,434
Maybe?

989
01:23:29,226 --> 01:23:34,272
And that even though the school sees us
as a bunch of mess-ups and wackos,

990
01:23:34,315 --> 01:23:37,568
we're gonna save them anyway
because that's the right thing to do.

991
01:23:37,985 --> 01:23:39,278
Yeah, that's pretty...

992
01:23:39,320 --> 01:23:42,865
And no matter what happens,
no matter how today turns out,

993
01:23:43,365 --> 01:23:47,619
we can say that we gave it our all
by doing the thing we do best,

994
01:23:47,662 --> 01:23:49,372
which is being our truest selves!

995
01:23:49,622 --> 01:23:52,624
So, let's get out there
and kick shadow magic's stupid butt!

996
01:23:52,667 --> 01:23:53,876
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

997
01:23:53,918 --> 01:23:56,671
I mean, I wouldn't have said
"stupid butt," but yeah,

998
01:23:56,712 --> 01:23:58,297
the rest of that sounds really good.

999
01:23:58,881 --> 01:24:00,173
Let's go!

1000
01:24:03,135 --> 01:24:08,098
Students, faculty, distinguished alumni.

1001
01:24:08,766 --> 01:24:12,645
Welcome to Founder's Day.

1002
01:24:17,900 --> 01:24:22,571
Today, we celebrate all things Sage.

1003
01:24:22,904 --> 01:24:26,658
Our grand traditions, our thrilling past

1004
01:24:27,200 --> 01:24:30,162
and our brilliant future.

1005
01:24:36,209 --> 01:24:42,257
Now, let the cavalcade of talent begin!

1006
01:24:46,803 --> 01:24:48,847
I'd like to bring to the stage

1007
01:24:48,888 --> 01:24:52,976
one of our most promising
first-year students.

1008
01:24:53,476 --> 01:24:56,187
Reina Carvajal!

1009
01:25:02,320 --> 01:25:07,867
Reina, come on up here
and show 'em what you got!

1010
01:25:33,559 --> 01:25:35,101
You think that's impressive?

1011
01:25:41,275 --> 01:25:42,944
Wanna see something even better?

1012
01:25:49,115 --> 01:25:50,493
Okay.

1013
01:25:51,744 --> 01:25:53,496
You asked for it.

1014
01:26:19,689 --> 01:26:22,691
Distinguished alumni...

1015
01:26:23,400 --> 01:26:26,945
...it has been far too long.

1016
01:26:30,324 --> 01:26:35,037
But I promise my return
will be very...

1017
01:26:36,538 --> 01:26:37,747
memorable.

1018
01:26:47,967 --> 01:26:50,886
Look upon me with wonder...

1019
01:26:54,265 --> 01:26:59,936
for I will be the last thing
any of you ever see!

1020
01:27:12,908 --> 01:27:15,328
- Shadow magic!
- But how?

1021
01:27:15,619 --> 01:27:20,373
She isn't a UDM!
Clearly, we were wrong about that!

1022
01:27:21,583 --> 01:27:23,251
Not today, shadow!

1023
01:27:24,044 --> 01:27:26,338
Flares! Shut it down!

1024
01:27:28,257 --> 01:27:29,634
Launch fireball!

1025
01:27:34,471 --> 01:27:40,101
Fuzzies, we need your animal allies!
Summon the birds of prey!

1026
01:27:40,977 --> 01:27:43,355
Birds attack!

1027
01:27:52,949 --> 01:27:54,325
Flyers!

1028
01:28:02,123 --> 01:28:05,669
What are you all doing?
Fly harder!

1029
01:28:05,962 --> 01:28:10,633
Obviously the monster's power is forcing
them back down to earth, Linda!

1030
01:28:10,675 --> 01:28:15,637
Do not call me Linda
in front of the students!

1031
01:28:16,471 --> 01:28:19,307
Fluxers! Take your animal forms!

1032
01:28:24,355 --> 01:28:28,484
Oh, okay, not exactly fierce!
Never mind!

1033
01:28:29,025 --> 01:28:30,318
Solid effort, though!

1034
01:28:30,860 --> 01:28:34,323
Flickers! Go! Go! Go! Go!

1035
01:28:34,949 --> 01:28:37,910
Tear it apart!

1036
01:28:46,293 --> 01:28:48,586
Now
there's even more of them!

1037
01:28:49,629 --> 01:28:51,298
I'm doomed!

1038
01:28:51,339 --> 01:28:54,968
- We've tried everything!
- No! Not everything!

1039
01:28:56,095 --> 01:28:57,887
There's one school left.

1040
01:29:01,684 --> 01:29:05,271
What are you going to do, Skriff?
You're upside down!

1041
01:29:05,520 --> 01:29:08,523
Yeah, and we're here to turn things
right-side up.

1042
01:29:11,526 --> 01:29:13,486
Let's narrow the playing field!

1043
01:29:16,031 --> 01:29:19,118
That's it! Push it back
into one monster again!

1044
01:29:20,328 --> 01:29:24,498
You got this! Yes!
That's it! You're doing it!

1045
01:29:30,503 --> 01:29:32,839
Elliot!

1046
01:29:34,550 --> 01:29:36,802
- You got it! Yes!
- Smoke it out!

1047
01:29:40,347 --> 01:29:43,350
Yeah, it can't see through all that smoke!

1048
01:29:44,351 --> 01:29:46,519
Yeah!

1049
01:29:46,811 --> 01:29:49,105
Andres, now!

1050
01:29:49,856 --> 01:29:50,815
Hey! Monster!

1051
01:29:53,235 --> 01:29:54,278
Come at me, bro!

1052
01:29:57,405 --> 01:29:59,240
- You need to go!
- Come on! Do it!

1053
01:29:59,742 --> 01:30:03,037
Come on, Rocket-boy!

1054
01:30:04,538 --> 01:30:06,165
Make it chase you.

1055
01:30:09,168 --> 01:30:10,252
Pepper, now!

1056
01:30:15,925 --> 01:30:17,467
It's getting tangled up!

1057
01:30:18,468 --> 01:30:19,552
Yes!

1058
01:30:20,096 --> 01:30:21,806
Okay, Nory, take us home!

1059
01:30:21,846 --> 01:30:26,184
Okay. Dritten. Dritten. Dritten!

1060
01:30:28,561 --> 01:30:30,647
Get it to try and catch you!

1061
01:30:31,899 --> 01:30:33,441
Yeah, Nory,

1062
01:30:33,484 --> 01:30:36,195
- you're too fast for it!
- It's working!

1063
01:30:36,236 --> 01:30:37,363
It can't catch you!

1064
01:30:37,404 --> 01:30:39,906
- Come on!
- Come on, Nory! You're doing it!

1065
01:30:41,492 --> 01:30:44,619
- It's all twisted around!
- It's getting tired!

1066
01:30:46,830 --> 01:30:49,958
- Yeah, kick that monster's stupid butt!
- Come on!

1067
01:30:50,458 --> 01:30:52,168
It's getting dizzy!

1068
01:30:55,172 --> 01:30:59,760
- It's tangled, it's gonna fall!
- Come on! Show it who's boss!

1069
01:31:04,723 --> 01:31:07,892
It's down! Finish it off!

1070
01:31:08,144 --> 01:31:09,686
- Flares!
- Flyers!

1071
01:31:09,729 --> 01:31:11,521
Fuzzies! Fluxers!

1072
01:31:16,610 --> 01:31:18,613
Skriff! What is your girl doing?

1073
01:31:19,904 --> 01:31:22,282
We can destroy this thing!

1074
01:31:22,324 --> 01:31:25,493
Yeah, well, "this thing"
is her best friend.

1075
01:31:35,296 --> 01:31:37,632
Reina! Reina, I know you're in there.

1076
01:31:38,089 --> 01:31:41,010
Reina, I need you to fight harder
than you've ever fought in your life.

1077
01:31:43,262 --> 01:31:44,513
Reina, listen to me!

1078
01:31:45,181 --> 01:31:49,769
You are a flame-throwing rock star.
And this is a lot.

1079
01:31:50,394 --> 01:31:53,481
But... we got this.

1080
01:32:11,623 --> 01:32:14,334
- What is that?
- Sparkle Fireball.

1081
01:32:14,877 --> 01:32:17,588
For sure, no doubt.
It's my favorite.

1082
01:32:20,800 --> 01:32:22,342
Reina, you got this!

1083
01:32:32,311 --> 01:32:33,312
Reina!

1084
01:32:35,522 --> 01:32:36,440
Are you okay?

1085
01:32:37,900 --> 01:32:38,901
Come on.

1086
01:32:56,877 --> 01:32:57,962
Nory?

1087
01:32:59,046 --> 01:33:00,256
Yeah, Reina?

1088
01:33:01,047 --> 01:33:03,508
Remember when I said
I was doing great?

1089
01:33:04,593 --> 01:33:05,595
Yeah?

1090
01:33:06,303 --> 01:33:07,512
I wasn't.

1091
01:33:08,346 --> 01:33:11,099
I wasn't, either.

1092
01:33:12,017 --> 01:33:15,645
But I´ll tell you what,
I'm doing a lot better now.

1093
01:33:16,439 --> 01:33:17,356
Me, too.

1094
01:33:19,441 --> 01:33:21,985
Up high!

1095
01:33:24,446 --> 01:33:28,659
Yes! We did it!

1096
01:33:35,373 --> 01:33:39,711
As you can imagine, Sage underwent
a lot of changes after that.

1097
01:33:41,504 --> 01:33:44,300
The UDM program was discontinued,

1098
01:33:44,342 --> 01:33:47,345
and all of us UDMs
joined our respective schools.

1099
01:33:51,891 --> 01:33:53,809
Elliot's an official Flare.

1100
01:34:00,357 --> 01:34:03,569
Andres is flying circles
around the Flyers.

1101
01:34:08,699 --> 01:34:11,077
Pepper's a star amongst Flickers.

1102
01:34:15,373 --> 01:34:19,085
Skriff is knocking them dead
as an official Fuzzy professor.

1103
01:34:19,918 --> 01:34:22,754
Come on let's show
'Em how it's done

1104
01:34:23,129 --> 01:34:25,466
Because we wanna make it fun

1105
01:34:26,967 --> 01:34:29,427
- And me?
- Hmm.

1106
01:34:29,845 --> 01:34:32,765
Kitten, panda, penguin.

1107
01:34:33,641 --> 01:34:35,434
Oh. Is that all?

1108
01:34:36,185 --> 01:34:37,186
Step back.

1109
01:34:37,227 --> 01:34:38,270
Reina was right.

1110
01:34:38,729 --> 01:34:42,732
Sage is teaching me to be
the best abomination I can be!

1111
01:34:49,949 --> 01:34:52,868
Pretty soon,
everyone forgot about the Sage way.

1112
01:34:53,410 --> 01:34:54,662
That's the old way.

1113
01:34:54,995 --> 01:34:57,580
The new way is to let kids be themselves.

1114
01:34:58,123 --> 01:35:00,959
After all, everybody has their something.

1115
01:35:02,211 --> 01:35:05,548
And letting everybody be the most
of their something they can be...

1116
01:35:06,548 --> 01:35:08,842
that's the real magic.

1117
01:35:44,808 --> 01:35:49,808
