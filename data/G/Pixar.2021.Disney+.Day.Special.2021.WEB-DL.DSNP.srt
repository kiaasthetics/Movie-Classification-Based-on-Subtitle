1
00:00:04,087 --> 00:00:06,464
Hello, everybody! And Happy Disney+ Day.

2
00:00:06,548 --> 00:00:09,676
My name is Pete Docter,
and I'm the chief creative officer

3
00:00:09,759 --> 00:00:11,052
at Pixar Animation Studios.

4
00:00:11,136 --> 00:00:14,931
I directed Monsters, Inc.,
Up, Inside Out and Soul.

5
00:00:15,015 --> 00:00:19,060
We have a lot of things cookin'
and a few sneak peeks for y'all today.

6
00:00:19,144 --> 00:00:21,104
So, in honor of Disney+ Day,

7
00:00:21,187 --> 00:00:23,148
let's go meet a few people
and take a look, huh?

8
00:00:24,733 --> 00:00:27,444
Okay, we're walking into
the Steve Jobs building,

9
00:00:27,527 --> 00:00:30,071
and I'm here
with my friends Luigi and Guido.

10
00:00:30,155 --> 00:00:31,239
There they are.

11
00:00:31,322 --> 00:00:34,409
I'm gonna let someone else
do the honors of our first announcement.

12
00:00:34,492 --> 00:00:38,955
Somebody that we know very well as Mater,
also known as Larry the Cable Guy.

13
00:00:39,039 --> 00:00:40,248
Take it away, Larry.

14
00:00:40,999 --> 00:00:44,711
Hey, Pete, hey, everybody,
and happy Disney+ Day.

15
00:00:44,794 --> 00:00:50,341
And I am, whoo-hoo, happier
than a tornado in a trailer park

16
00:00:50,425 --> 00:00:53,261
to confirm that I will be playing

17
00:00:53,344 --> 00:00:56,890
the lovable little tow truck,
Mater, in the new series,

18
00:00:56,973 --> 00:00:58,475
Cars On The Road.

19
00:00:59,142 --> 00:01:03,271
It is just a cross-country road trip
between McQueen and Mater.

20
00:01:03,354 --> 00:01:05,148
Or should I say, Mater and McQueen?

21
00:01:05,231 --> 00:01:07,233
And it's full of all the fun and laughs

22
00:01:07,317 --> 00:01:10,612
that you've come to expect
from the world of Cars.

23
00:01:10,695 --> 00:01:14,449
So, check us out next year on Disney+.

24
00:01:14,532 --> 00:01:17,327
Can't wait. Whoo-hoo! Dadgum!

25
00:01:17,410 --> 00:01:19,287
All right, Pete, back to you, buddy.

26
00:01:19,370 --> 00:01:21,122
DOCTER: Yes, folks.
You heard it here first.

27
00:01:21,206 --> 00:01:25,376
Both Owen Wilson and Larry the Cable Guy
will be reprising their roles

28
00:01:25,460 --> 00:01:28,797
as McQueen and Mater in Cars On The Road

29
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:31,758
which streams next year on Disney+.

30
00:01:31,841 --> 00:01:33,468
Okay, pretty cool.

31
00:01:33,551 --> 00:01:36,471
All right, so now we are leaving
the Steve Jobs building,

32
00:01:36,554 --> 00:01:39,224
which is where we do most
of our production work, in there.

33
00:01:39,307 --> 00:01:41,142
We're gonna walk over to Brooklyn.

34
00:01:41,226 --> 00:01:42,685
Brooklyn is another building

35
00:01:42,769 --> 00:01:45,438
where we do a lot of our development work
on upcoming projects...

36
00:01:45,522 --> 00:01:47,232
And oh, my gosh. Look, it's Domee Shi,

37
00:01:47,315 --> 00:01:49,150
-the director of Turning Red.
-Hello.

38
00:01:49,234 --> 00:01:51,611
-And Angus MacLane, director of Lightyear.
-How's it going?

39
00:01:51,694 --> 00:01:53,655
-How's it going, guys?
-Is this Disney+ Day?

40
00:01:53,738 --> 00:01:55,657
-This is Happy Disney+ Day!
-Happy Disney+ Day!

41
00:01:55,740 --> 00:01:56,741
-Hey!
-Yay!

42
00:01:56,825 --> 00:01:58,868
Actually, we're gonna go
to the main theatre...

43
00:01:58,952 --> 00:01:59,953
Yeah.

44
00:02:00,036 --> 00:02:02,163
...where we're finalizing
a whole sequence.

45
00:02:02,247 --> 00:02:04,249
Yeah. We're super busy.
Got movies to finish.

46
00:02:04,332 --> 00:02:05,917
Always busy, the life of a director.

47
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,003
I don't know if you've ever wondered
what the life of a director is like.

48
00:02:09,087 --> 00:02:12,340
If you have, you're in luck
because we have two separate documentaries

49
00:02:12,423 --> 00:02:15,635
exploring the making
of Turning Red and Lightyear.

50
00:02:15,718 --> 00:02:16,761
Isn't that right, guys?

51
00:02:17,929 --> 00:02:19,681
Wait, where'd they go?

52
00:02:19,764 --> 00:02:21,307
Oh, they already went inside.

53
00:02:21,975 --> 00:02:23,393
Okay, movin' on!

54
00:02:25,353 --> 00:02:26,896
Okay, we are here in Brooklyn.

55
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:30,441
Brooklyn is where most
of our films begin their lives.

56
00:02:30,525 --> 00:02:33,778
And, oh, some of you might recognize
this Vespa

57
00:02:33,862 --> 00:02:35,822
from our most recent film, Luca.

58
00:02:35,905 --> 00:02:38,533
Luca, of course,
is about Luca and Alberto,

59
00:02:38,616 --> 00:02:42,328
two sea monsters who have a fun
filled summer on the Italian coast.

60
00:02:42,412 --> 00:02:44,831
You know what, to tell you
about this next announcement,

61
00:02:44,914 --> 00:02:48,501
let's call on the voice of Alberto,
Jack Dylan Grazer.

62
00:02:48,585 --> 00:02:49,878
-Jack?
-Hey, Pete!

63
00:02:49,961 --> 00:02:52,046
And Happy Disney+ Day, everybody!

64
00:02:52,130 --> 00:02:53,631
Oh, my gosh! This is big.

65
00:02:53,715 --> 00:02:58,011
Playing Alberto in Pixar's Luca
was like a dream come true for me.

66
00:02:58,094 --> 00:02:59,762
Uh, I'm seriously so grateful for that.

67
00:02:59,846 --> 00:03:03,099
And I'm even more grateful
and excited for a little short film.

68
00:03:03,183 --> 00:03:08,479
A big, huge, massive, awesome short film
coming out today called Ciao Alberto.

69
00:03:08,563 --> 00:03:11,399
It stars Alberto
and Giulia's father Massimo.

70
00:03:11,482 --> 00:03:14,068
And basically what it does
is it reveals the story

71
00:03:14,152 --> 00:03:16,446
about what happens
after Luca leaves for school.

72
00:03:16,529 --> 00:03:18,573
I hope you love it as much as I do.

73
00:03:18,656 --> 00:03:21,326
So, with that being said,
it's back to you, Pete.

74
00:03:21,951 --> 00:03:23,870
All right, thanks, Jack. That was cool.

75
00:03:23,953 --> 00:03:25,455
Hey, since we're here,

76
00:03:25,538 --> 00:03:27,749
uh, let's take a little look
around Brooklyn.

77
00:03:27,832 --> 00:03:29,000
See what else we can find.

78
00:03:29,083 --> 00:03:32,003
Ooh, hey, look, it's Michael Yates
and Carrie Hobson.

79
00:03:32,086 --> 00:03:33,713
-Oh! Oh, hey, Pete.
-DOCTER: Hi, you guys.

80
00:03:33,796 --> 00:03:35,548
-We're so busy working like usual.
-DOCTER: I see.

81
00:03:35,632 --> 00:03:38,593
I see. Yes, you're working very hard.
What are you working on?

82
00:03:38,676 --> 00:03:41,221
-Oh, our show.
-Oh, our show for Disney+.

83
00:03:41,304 --> 00:03:42,639
-Win Or Lose.
-Oh, yeah.

84
00:03:42,722 --> 00:03:44,974
I just happen to be here
with Disney+ viewers.

85
00:03:45,058 --> 00:03:46,809
Why don't you tell us a little about it?

86
00:03:46,893 --> 00:03:50,355
Yeah. Win Or Lose follows
a middle school co-ed softball team

87
00:03:50,438 --> 00:03:53,816
throughout one week leading up
to the big championship game.

88
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:57,612
Each episode follows a different character
as we go through the same week.

89
00:03:57,695 --> 00:04:01,866
And each episode puts you into the shoes
of that character using animation.

90
00:04:01,950 --> 00:04:05,370
So, we really feel
what it's like to experience life.

91
00:04:05,453 --> 00:04:08,414
YATES: Yeah, like,
what it's like when you're coach Dad.

92
00:04:08,498 --> 00:04:11,251
It's just, like,
the biggest thing in your whole world.

93
00:04:11,334 --> 00:04:12,835
HOBSON: Or when you're up to bat

94
00:04:12,919 --> 00:04:15,046
and, you know,
you're melting with anxiety.

95
00:04:15,129 --> 00:04:17,131
YATES: Or you're the little brother
at the game

96
00:04:17,215 --> 00:04:18,758
and you're just bored out of your mind.

97
00:04:18,841 --> 00:04:20,260
You have to create your own world.

98
00:04:20,343 --> 00:04:23,888
HOBSON: Or when you're the star player
and you make that game-winning catch,

99
00:04:23,972 --> 00:04:25,556
you feel like you're on top of the world.

100
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:27,600
-That's our show.
-YATES: Super excited.

101
00:04:27,684 --> 00:04:30,019
-Can't wait to show you guys more.
-HOBSON: 2023.

102
00:04:30,103 --> 00:04:31,813
That about wraps it up from here.

103
00:04:31,896 --> 00:04:35,191
Happy Disney+ Day.
Hope you enjoy the sneak peeks.

104
00:04:35,275 --> 00:04:37,986
And maybe I'll just
take one of these for the road.

105
00:04:38,069 --> 00:04:40,446
-Uh, thanks.
-Okay, bye.

106
00:04:40,530 --> 00:04:42,115
-Bye.
-All right.

107
00:04:42,198 --> 00:04:43,658
Good to see everybody.
