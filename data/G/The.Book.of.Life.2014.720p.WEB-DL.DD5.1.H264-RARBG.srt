1
00:01:06,984 --> 00:01:08,614
Last tour of the day.

2
00:01:09,236 --> 00:01:10,696
I wonder why nobody wants them.

3
00:01:15,325 --> 00:01:16,485
Bull's-eye.

4
00:01:18,537 --> 00:01:20,617
Hi, super old guy!

5
00:01:20,664 --> 00:01:22,544
A museum? Again?

6
00:01:24,209 --> 00:01:25,709
I hate stuff.

7
00:01:25,752 --> 00:01:27,342
- Oh, boy.
- It's okay, Thomas.

8
00:01:28,589 --> 00:01:29,919
I'll take them.

9
00:01:30,674 --> 00:01:32,134
Are you sure?

10
00:01:32,176 --> 00:01:34,336
I think these are the "detention" kids.

11
00:01:36,054 --> 00:01:38,394
Don't you worry. I can handle them.

12
00:01:38,432 --> 00:01:39,852
You go take your break.

13
00:01:39,892 --> 00:01:41,562
Thanks.

14
00:01:43,854 --> 00:01:45,024
Follow me, kids.

15
00:01:49,526 --> 00:01:52,396
Yo, lady! The museum door is that way.

16
00:01:52,446 --> 00:01:54,856
Yes, it is,
but you aren't like the other kids.

17
00:01:54,907 --> 00:01:56,317
Oh, no, no, no.

18
00:01:56,366 --> 00:01:59,116
You need to see something special.

19
00:02:01,747 --> 00:02:03,367
Right through that door.

20
00:02:04,583 --> 00:02:06,043
You're seeing things, lady.

21
00:02:06,543 --> 00:02:07,383
Am I?

22
00:02:07,419 --> 00:02:09,749
Or are you not seeing things?

23
00:02:09,796 --> 00:02:11,336
Whoa.

24
00:02:11,381 --> 00:02:13,051
Come on.

25
00:02:21,558 --> 00:02:23,888
Now, today is November 2nd.

26
00:02:23,936 --> 00:02:26,516
Does anyone here
know why that date is important?

27
00:02:26,563 --> 00:02:28,363
Taco Tuesday!

28
00:02:28,398 --> 00:02:29,228
No.

29
00:02:29,274 --> 00:02:31,784
"Gorge yourself on Halloween candy" day?

30
00:02:33,278 --> 00:02:36,358
- Nope. Today is the day of the dead.
- Wait.

31
00:02:36,406 --> 00:02:38,656
Is that national zombie day
or something?

32
00:02:40,827 --> 00:02:42,367
You can't go this way!

33
00:02:42,412 --> 00:02:44,612
You will get us both in trouble.
Ancient rules of the...

34
00:02:45,457 --> 00:02:48,457
Museum administration.

35
00:02:48,502 --> 00:02:52,092
Well, I suppose I could turn
a blind eye, my...

36
00:02:52,923 --> 00:02:54,093
Dear.

37
00:02:58,595 --> 00:03:01,005
Behold, children, the glorious beauty...

38
00:03:01,431 --> 00:03:03,021
Of Mexico!

39
00:03:11,608 --> 00:03:12,608
Whoa!

40
00:03:13,151 --> 00:03:16,071
This place is loco.

41
00:03:16,113 --> 00:03:19,033
So many skulls!

42
00:03:19,366 --> 00:03:20,946
At least that part isn't lame.

43
00:03:24,121 --> 00:03:25,461
Whoa!

44
00:03:26,164 --> 00:03:27,424
What is this book?

45
00:03:27,457 --> 00:03:30,087
That is the book of life.

46
00:03:30,127 --> 00:03:32,207
All the world is made of stories...

47
00:03:32,254 --> 00:03:36,094
And all of those stories are right here.

48
00:03:36,633 --> 00:03:38,643
This book holds many truths.

49
00:03:39,303 --> 00:03:41,643
Some are actually true.

50
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:45,100
"The battle of cinco de Mayo"?

51
00:03:45,142 --> 00:03:48,232
Mayo! I love Mayo.

52
00:03:48,270 --> 00:03:50,560
And some, not so much.

53
00:03:50,606 --> 00:03:54,476
El chupacabras,
the legendary goat sucker?

54
00:03:54,526 --> 00:03:56,436
I have to get one.

55
00:03:57,112 --> 00:03:59,492
Now, although you may doubt
some of these stories...

56
00:03:59,531 --> 00:04:01,781
There is one thing
that we know for certain.

57
00:04:01,825 --> 00:04:05,285
Mexico is the center of the universe.

58
00:04:05,329 --> 00:04:07,829
And long ago, in the center of Mexico...

59
00:04:07,873 --> 00:04:11,003
Was the quaint little town of San angel.

60
00:04:11,043 --> 00:04:13,803
Churros! Churros!

61
00:04:14,713 --> 00:04:16,463
Frosted churros!

62
00:04:16,715 --> 00:04:20,135
Now, naturally, since San angel
was the center of the universe...

63
00:04:20,177 --> 00:04:21,887
Directly below it lay...

64
00:04:22,346 --> 00:04:24,306
The land of the remembered.

65
00:04:24,348 --> 00:04:27,928
A festive and magical place
for those who live on...

66
00:04:27,976 --> 00:04:29,476
In the memories of their loved ones.

67
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:30,520
And below that...

68
00:04:30,812 --> 00:04:32,732
Lies the land of the forgotten.

69
00:04:34,149 --> 00:04:37,779
The sad and lonely destination
for those poor souls...

70
00:04:37,819 --> 00:04:39,319
Who are no longer remembered.

71
00:04:39,363 --> 00:04:42,453
But before I can properly
begin our story...

72
00:04:42,491 --> 00:04:46,661
You need to meet the two magical rulers
of these realms.

73
00:04:46,703 --> 00:04:48,333
Who is that?

74
00:04:48,372 --> 00:04:50,542
That is LA muerte.

75
00:04:50,582 --> 00:04:53,382
She is made out of sweet sugar candy.

76
00:04:53,418 --> 00:04:54,998
She's so pretty.

77
00:04:55,045 --> 00:04:56,295
She is, isn't she?

78
00:04:56,338 --> 00:04:57,958
She loves all mankind...

79
00:04:58,006 --> 00:05:00,376
And believes that their hearts
are pure and true.

80
00:05:00,759 --> 00:05:03,049
And that is xibalba.

81
00:05:03,095 --> 00:05:08,185
That charming rascal thinks mankind
is not so pure, just like him.

82
00:05:08,225 --> 00:05:09,895
He looks spooky.

83
00:05:10,227 --> 00:05:13,517
Yes, he's made out of tar
and everything icky in the whole world.

84
00:05:13,564 --> 00:05:14,694
He's so...

85
00:05:14,731 --> 00:05:16,271
Pretty.

86
00:05:17,067 --> 00:05:19,567
What about the weirdo with the beard-o?

87
00:05:20,779 --> 00:05:25,529
That is the candle maker.
He keeps everything in balance.

88
00:05:25,576 --> 00:05:28,616
He's made out of wax
and has a beard full of clouds.

89
00:05:28,662 --> 00:05:29,832
Clouds?

90
00:05:29,872 --> 00:05:32,372
All right.
Let me show you something else.

91
00:05:32,416 --> 00:05:33,876
All of these wooden figures here...

92
00:05:34,418 --> 00:05:37,838
Represent real people in our story,
just like you and me.

93
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:39,460
Whoa.

94
00:05:39,798 --> 00:05:41,508
And so, our tale begins...

95
00:05:41,758 --> 00:05:43,508
On the day the people of Mexico call...

96
00:05:44,219 --> 00:05:46,179
The day of the dead.

97
00:05:46,221 --> 00:05:47,471
No retreat.

98
00:05:47,514 --> 00:05:48,774
No surrender!

99
00:05:52,102 --> 00:05:53,902
On this festive, enchanted day...

100
00:05:54,521 --> 00:05:56,151
Families bring food and offerings...

101
00:05:56,190 --> 00:05:57,480
To the altars of their beloved.

102
00:05:57,524 --> 00:06:00,244
It's like a hundred birthday parties.

103
00:06:00,277 --> 00:06:01,277
Yes, it is.

104
00:06:01,612 --> 00:06:03,702
And on this particular
day of the dead...

105
00:06:03,739 --> 00:06:06,319
After centuries of being banished...

106
00:06:06,366 --> 00:06:08,326
Xibalba had had enough.

107
00:06:08,368 --> 00:06:09,488
Really, my dear...

108
00:06:09,536 --> 00:06:14,036
You have no idea how cold and vile
the land of the forgotten has become.

109
00:06:15,417 --> 00:06:17,337
Just like your heart, xibalba.

110
00:06:17,377 --> 00:06:19,457
Just like your heart.

111
00:06:23,091 --> 00:06:25,051
Why must I rule a bleak wasteland...

112
00:06:25,093 --> 00:06:28,513
While you enjoy the endless fiesta
in the land of the remembered?

113
00:06:28,555 --> 00:06:29,965
It's simply unfair.

114
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:31,390
Xibalba!

115
00:06:31,433 --> 00:06:33,393
What? It's his time.

116
00:06:33,435 --> 00:06:34,435
More or less.

117
00:06:34,895 --> 00:06:36,405
Not today, my love.

118
00:06:36,438 --> 00:06:39,608
Come on, my dear. Trade lands with me.

119
00:06:39,650 --> 00:06:41,150
I beg you!

120
00:06:41,985 --> 00:06:44,945
You're so cute when you beg.

121
00:06:45,239 --> 00:06:47,069
I'm serious. I hate it down there.

122
00:06:47,449 --> 00:06:49,529
Hey. You're there because you cheated!

123
00:06:49,576 --> 00:06:51,656
You made your bed with that wager.

124
00:06:52,496 --> 00:06:54,246
You're not the man I fell in love with...

125
00:06:54,289 --> 00:06:55,829
All those centuries ago.

126
00:06:56,250 --> 00:06:59,130
Let's not dwell in the past, mi Amor.

127
00:07:00,629 --> 00:07:02,959
Anyway, I was thinking...

128
00:07:03,006 --> 00:07:05,126
How about another little wager?

129
00:07:05,175 --> 00:07:08,085
You think you can calm the
flames of my anger with another bet?

130
00:07:11,265 --> 00:07:13,855
What exactly did you have in mind?

131
00:07:15,978 --> 00:07:18,518
Let's check out the menu
for the evening.

132
00:07:19,147 --> 00:07:21,687
Look there, my love.
Classic mortal dilemma.

133
00:07:22,317 --> 00:07:24,527
Two boys. Best friends, no less.

134
00:07:25,487 --> 00:07:27,817
In love with the same girl.

135
00:07:27,865 --> 00:07:30,665
Fear not, señorita.
Your hero has arrived!

136
00:07:31,034 --> 00:07:32,124
Is that so?

137
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:35,160
How dare you interrupt a guitarrista?

138
00:07:44,006 --> 00:07:45,126
The girl is mine.

139
00:07:45,174 --> 00:07:46,014
Never!

140
00:07:46,049 --> 00:07:47,509
She is mine.

141
00:07:48,051 --> 00:07:49,051
I belong...

142
00:07:49,052 --> 00:07:50,932
To no one.

143
00:07:50,971 --> 00:07:52,221
Whoa.

144
00:07:53,348 --> 00:07:56,848
I believe we have our wager.
Which boy will marry her?

145
00:07:56,894 --> 00:07:57,894
Very well.

146
00:07:58,729 --> 00:08:02,479
We will each choose one of these boys
as our champion.

147
00:08:03,901 --> 00:08:06,531
Let's go wish them luck.

148
00:08:06,570 --> 00:08:08,410
Maria, weren't you grounded?

149
00:08:09,072 --> 00:08:10,702
My father is overreacting.

150
00:08:10,741 --> 00:08:13,741
How was I supposed to know
that chickens don't like baths?

151
00:08:14,912 --> 00:08:18,002
Don't worry. He knows a real man
is protecting you tonight.

152
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:19,500
You're not even close.

153
00:08:19,541 --> 00:08:20,831
But I have a moustache.

154
00:08:20,876 --> 00:08:23,036
Yeah, just like your grandma.

155
00:08:26,590 --> 00:08:28,050
Maria.

156
00:08:28,091 --> 00:08:29,881
Manolo!

157
00:08:35,432 --> 00:08:36,432
Come, mijo.

158
00:08:38,268 --> 00:08:40,558
Your mother would be so proud of you.

159
00:08:41,897 --> 00:08:44,067
You think she'll come back tonight?

160
00:08:44,107 --> 00:08:45,647
Carmen is here.

161
00:08:45,692 --> 00:08:47,442
But it's more like...

162
00:08:48,111 --> 00:08:51,871
A warm feeling you get
when loved ones are with you.

163
00:08:52,241 --> 00:08:54,911
All of these families have lost someone.

164
00:08:54,952 --> 00:08:56,952
But as long as we remember them...

165
00:08:57,287 --> 00:08:59,077
We can feel their presence with us...

166
00:08:59,122 --> 00:09:00,872
For one night each year.

167
00:09:02,459 --> 00:09:07,209
I just thought I might see her
one more time.

168
00:09:11,301 --> 00:09:13,891
She always smelled like flowers.

169
00:09:15,973 --> 00:09:18,603
I remember her singing.

170
00:09:19,476 --> 00:09:22,396
She was a good woman, that one.

171
00:09:22,437 --> 00:09:25,817
I miss her so much.

172
00:09:26,275 --> 00:09:29,825
Just be still, and you can feel it.

173
00:09:30,654 --> 00:09:35,584
Your mother is here,
along with all our ancestors.

174
00:09:35,617 --> 00:09:39,617
As long as we remember them,
they are with us.

175
00:09:39,663 --> 00:09:44,083
The moment we forget them,
they are truly gone.

176
00:09:46,003 --> 00:09:47,963
I can feel them.

177
00:09:48,005 --> 00:09:49,215
Kind people...

178
00:09:49,256 --> 00:09:51,926
May I please have a bit of your bread?

179
00:09:51,967 --> 00:09:53,797
I am so hungry.

180
00:09:54,511 --> 00:09:56,511
I'm sure mama would want you to have it.

181
00:09:56,847 --> 00:09:57,847
Right, papa?

182
00:09:59,183 --> 00:10:00,643
Thank you, my dear.

183
00:10:00,684 --> 00:10:04,314
In return, you have my blessing.

184
00:10:04,354 --> 00:10:08,484
May your heart be
always pure and courageous.

185
00:10:08,525 --> 00:10:09,725
What do we say, Manolo?

186
00:10:09,776 --> 00:10:12,316
Thank you, señora. Thank you.

187
00:10:12,696 --> 00:10:13,986
Ah, Manolo.

188
00:10:14,031 --> 00:10:16,411
Always giving away stuff for free.

189
00:10:16,450 --> 00:10:17,450
Right, dad?

190
00:10:18,202 --> 00:10:20,202
Joaquin's father, captain mondragon...

191
00:10:20,537 --> 00:10:22,287
Had passed away fighting
the fearsome bandit...

192
00:10:22,331 --> 00:10:24,671
Known as chakal.

193
00:10:27,377 --> 00:10:28,547
Who's in there?

194
00:10:32,382 --> 00:10:36,432
Young sir, may I please
have some of your bread?

195
00:10:36,845 --> 00:10:39,215
I'm so hungry.

196
00:10:40,224 --> 00:10:42,234
This bread is for my father.

197
00:10:42,267 --> 00:10:43,887
And it's delicious.

198
00:10:44,269 --> 00:10:47,769
Well, perhaps
you would consider a trade?

199
00:10:48,565 --> 00:10:50,895
An old medal? Please.

200
00:10:51,568 --> 00:10:53,698
This is no ordinary medal, my boy.

201
00:10:53,737 --> 00:10:57,367
As long as you wear it,
you cannot be hurt.

202
00:10:57,407 --> 00:11:00,197
And it will give you
immeasurable courage.

203
00:11:00,244 --> 00:11:01,584
Really?

204
00:11:01,620 --> 00:11:02,620
Deal.

205
00:11:04,414 --> 00:11:07,174
But keep it hidden.

206
00:11:07,209 --> 00:11:09,209
There is a bandit king...

207
00:11:09,253 --> 00:11:12,633
Who would stop at nothing
to get it back.

208
00:11:12,923 --> 00:11:14,383
Bandit king?

209
00:11:14,424 --> 00:11:15,934
You mean chakal?

210
00:11:17,302 --> 00:11:18,432
Where did he go?

211
00:11:20,764 --> 00:11:23,524
So, then, if my boy marries the girl...

212
00:11:23,559 --> 00:11:26,519
I will finally rule
the land of the remembered.

213
00:11:26,562 --> 00:11:31,112
And if my boy marries the girl,
you will...

214
00:11:31,775 --> 00:11:34,065
You will stop interfering
with the affairs of man!

215
00:11:34,111 --> 00:11:35,111
What?

216
00:11:35,571 --> 00:11:36,741
I can't do that!

217
00:11:36,780 --> 00:11:38,910
Come on. It's the only fun I ever get!

218
00:11:39,283 --> 00:11:40,743
Then the bet is off.

219
00:11:44,496 --> 00:11:45,496
Very well, my dear.

220
00:11:45,956 --> 00:11:48,076
By the ancient rules...

221
00:11:48,625 --> 00:11:49,995
The wager is set.

222
00:11:51,295 --> 00:11:54,305
And, so, the greatest wager
in history began.

223
00:11:54,965 --> 00:11:58,435
Manolo versus joaquin
for the hand of Maria.

224
00:11:58,468 --> 00:12:01,968
Wait. So these ancient gods
picked three little kids to...

225
00:12:02,014 --> 00:12:04,064
Represent the whole world?

226
00:12:04,099 --> 00:12:06,099
- Yeah. Pretty crazy, right?
- Yeah!

227
00:12:06,476 --> 00:12:08,306
Keep going, lady.

228
00:12:21,992 --> 00:12:23,282
You're so cute.

229
00:12:29,958 --> 00:12:30,998
Oh, no.

230
00:12:31,043 --> 00:12:32,793
Not on my watch.

231
00:12:33,170 --> 00:12:35,960
We have to free the animals!

232
00:12:36,673 --> 00:12:37,803
Come on, you guys!

233
00:12:37,841 --> 00:12:39,131
Let's do this!

234
00:12:39,176 --> 00:12:40,176
- Yeah!
- Hold on, Maria.

235
00:12:40,219 --> 00:12:41,219
Don't!

236
00:12:44,348 --> 00:12:46,678
People of San angel, please!

237
00:12:46,725 --> 00:12:48,175
I beg you.

238
00:12:48,227 --> 00:12:49,807
After the revolution...

239
00:12:49,853 --> 00:12:54,863
We need more volunteers
to join this mighty brigade!

240
00:13:00,697 --> 00:13:04,907
A heroic brigade
to protect us from chakal.

241
00:13:08,372 --> 00:13:09,502
Chakal is here!

242
00:13:14,545 --> 00:13:18,055
Freedom!

243
00:13:23,762 --> 00:13:26,222
Maria, what have you done now?

244
00:13:26,265 --> 00:13:28,565
Freedom is coming through!

245
00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:31,020
Stop!

246
00:13:44,074 --> 00:13:45,084
Oh, no!

247
00:13:56,461 --> 00:13:57,801
Whoa.

248
00:13:58,755 --> 00:13:59,755
Oh, dear.

249
00:14:00,591 --> 00:14:01,841
No retreat.

250
00:14:01,884 --> 00:14:03,054
No surrender.

251
00:14:14,479 --> 00:14:16,439
He has the gift.

252
00:14:29,786 --> 00:14:30,946
Great form, mijo.

253
00:14:50,641 --> 00:14:52,101
That's my son!

254
00:14:52,142 --> 00:14:53,772
Thank you, Manolo.

255
00:14:53,810 --> 00:14:55,350
Gracias

256
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:57,480
oh, my.

257
00:14:57,648 --> 00:14:59,268
What did I miss?

258
00:14:59,316 --> 00:15:00,356
You okay, sir?

259
00:15:01,443 --> 00:15:03,283
You have saved my life.

260
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:04,320
And I...

261
00:15:05,364 --> 00:15:06,494
quiet, boy. I'm talking.

262
00:15:06,532 --> 00:15:07,532
- But I...
- Quiet.

263
00:15:10,702 --> 00:15:13,042
That girl is in so much trouble!

264
00:15:13,413 --> 00:15:14,623
Uh-oh.

265
00:15:14,665 --> 00:15:18,385
Maria!

266
00:15:18,418 --> 00:15:19,788
I'm sorry, papa.

267
00:15:19,837 --> 00:15:21,627
It's just that I...

268
00:15:21,672 --> 00:15:22,922
Manolo's guitar.

269
00:15:24,675 --> 00:15:25,885
Maria!

270
00:15:25,926 --> 00:15:28,466
This rebellious nonsense ends now!

271
00:15:28,512 --> 00:15:30,972
You are going to become a proper lady.

272
00:15:31,014 --> 00:15:31,724
Why?

273
00:15:31,765 --> 00:15:33,015
Because I said so!

274
00:15:33,058 --> 00:15:34,638
I'm sending you to Spain.

275
00:15:34,685 --> 00:15:38,155
The sisters at the
convent of the perpetual flame of purity...

276
00:15:38,188 --> 00:15:39,308
Will straighten you out.

277
00:15:39,356 --> 00:15:40,896
- What?
- But, papa!

278
00:15:40,941 --> 00:15:43,401
No. It is decided. Now go home!

279
00:15:47,739 --> 00:15:51,239
Joaquin, you are so much
like your father.

280
00:15:51,702 --> 00:15:54,202
This town could use a new hero.

281
00:15:54,580 --> 00:15:55,710
Come.

282
00:15:56,039 --> 00:15:58,499
You are like the son I never had.

283
00:15:58,542 --> 00:16:01,542
My boy, your father
was like a brother to me.

284
00:16:09,094 --> 00:16:10,554
Where do you think you're going?

285
00:16:10,596 --> 00:16:12,426
He can't send Maria away.

286
00:16:12,472 --> 00:16:15,142
Well, fathers do what's best
for their children.

287
00:16:15,559 --> 00:16:16,809
Come along.

288
00:16:21,064 --> 00:16:23,444
I saw how you fought that beast.

289
00:16:23,483 --> 00:16:25,783
You made our ancestors proud.

290
00:16:25,819 --> 00:16:27,449
Do you think Maria was impressed?

291
00:16:27,487 --> 00:16:29,067
Maria and every girl in town.

292
00:16:29,615 --> 00:16:33,415
People said I was the greatest bullfighter
in our family's history...

293
00:16:33,452 --> 00:16:37,792
But it is you, my son,
who will be the greatest Sanchez ever!

294
00:16:38,665 --> 00:16:40,125
They will write songs about you!

295
00:16:40,167 --> 00:16:41,577
And I will sing them!

296
00:16:41,919 --> 00:16:42,959
Wait, what?

297
00:16:43,754 --> 00:16:46,134
I will sing them.

298
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:51,300
Son, music is not work
fit for a Sanchez bullfighter.

299
00:16:51,345 --> 00:16:52,895
But I want to be a musician.

300
00:16:52,930 --> 00:16:54,970
No. You must focus.

301
00:16:55,015 --> 00:16:56,465
Your training begins at once.

302
00:16:56,517 --> 00:16:59,017
Your grandpa, Luis,
taught me when I was about your age.

303
00:16:59,353 --> 00:17:03,113
Wait, isn't that when that bull
put you in a coma?

304
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:05,780
Ah, memories.

305
00:17:06,026 --> 00:17:09,146
My only son fighting angry,
thousand-pound beasts.

306
00:17:09,613 --> 00:17:11,413
The family tradition continues.

307
00:17:11,448 --> 00:17:13,198
Yay.

308
00:17:16,620 --> 00:17:21,330
And so, the day came
when Maria would leave to study abroad.

309
00:17:21,375 --> 00:17:23,965
The three amigos would be no more.

310
00:17:24,002 --> 00:17:30,972
Adios, Maria

311
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:34,720
write soon.

312
00:17:35,973 --> 00:17:37,643
I'm going to go over there.

313
00:17:40,060 --> 00:17:42,440
I'm gonna miss you guys.

314
00:17:42,479 --> 00:17:44,649
We'll be here, waiting.

315
00:17:44,690 --> 00:17:46,610
For as long as it takes.

316
00:17:46,650 --> 00:17:49,360
Don't ever stop playing, okay?

317
00:17:49,820 --> 00:17:50,950
And you.

318
00:17:50,988 --> 00:17:53,778
Don't you ever stop fighting
for what's right.

319
00:17:53,824 --> 00:17:56,794
I got you a present.
You should probably open it now.

320
00:17:56,827 --> 00:17:58,667
Wait a second.
We were supposed to bring gifts?

321
00:18:03,834 --> 00:18:05,544
I named him chuy.

322
00:18:05,586 --> 00:18:06,706
He'll look after you.

323
00:18:08,338 --> 00:18:10,668
I remember you.

324
00:18:10,716 --> 00:18:15,006
I figured you needed
a little part of town to go with you.

325
00:18:15,053 --> 00:18:16,183
Thank you.

326
00:18:16,513 --> 00:18:18,723
Seriously, no one told me
about bringing gifts.

327
00:18:18,765 --> 00:18:20,845
Can you hold chuy for me?

328
00:18:23,061 --> 00:18:26,061
This is to make up for
breaking your guitar.

329
00:18:26,523 --> 00:18:29,033
All aboard!

330
00:18:31,737 --> 00:18:33,197
I gotta go.

331
00:18:34,114 --> 00:18:36,324
Don't forget me!

332
00:18:36,366 --> 00:18:37,366
Maria!

333
00:18:37,367 --> 00:18:38,697
Your bonnet!

334
00:18:57,763 --> 00:19:00,273
Maria!

335
00:19:02,726 --> 00:19:04,266
When you come back...

336
00:19:04,311 --> 00:19:06,941
I will sing for you!

337
00:19:06,980 --> 00:19:09,900
And I will fight for you!

338
00:19:14,571 --> 00:19:18,831
It would be years
before they would see Maria again.

339
00:19:21,119 --> 00:19:24,079
I will wait for you.

340
00:19:24,790 --> 00:19:26,920
I'll be bold

341
00:19:28,418 --> 00:19:30,998
as well as strong

342
00:19:31,797 --> 00:19:32,797
one, two, three.

343
00:19:32,798 --> 00:19:36,048
And use my head

344
00:19:36,093 --> 00:19:38,603
alongside my heart

345
00:19:39,930 --> 00:19:41,010
so tame my flesh

346
00:19:43,767 --> 00:19:45,387
and fix my eyes

347
00:19:45,435 --> 00:19:47,645
one, two, three!
One, two, three!

348
00:19:47,688 --> 00:19:51,398
A tethered mind

349
00:19:51,441 --> 00:19:54,281
freed from the lies

350
00:19:56,280 --> 00:20:00,830
and I'll kneel down

351
00:20:01,118 --> 00:20:05,118
- wait for now
- hey, Manny!

352
00:20:05,163 --> 00:20:09,753
I kneel down

353
00:20:09,793 --> 00:20:13,383
- know my ground
- yes! Just like your father!

354
00:20:15,465 --> 00:20:18,585
'Cause I will wait
I will wait for you

355
00:20:18,635 --> 00:20:21,635
and that's how you finish a bull!

356
00:20:23,140 --> 00:20:24,180
And I will wait

357
00:20:24,892 --> 00:20:28,142
I will wait for you

358
00:20:30,856 --> 00:20:34,976
and I will wait
I will wait for you

359
00:20:38,822 --> 00:20:41,122
I will wait, I will...

360
00:20:41,158 --> 00:20:42,948
I will not wait for you!

361
00:20:42,993 --> 00:20:44,123
Papa, I was on my way.

362
00:20:44,161 --> 00:20:48,001
After years of training, Manolo's
father organized his first bullfight

363
00:20:48,415 --> 00:20:49,995
which, as luck would have it...

364
00:20:50,334 --> 00:20:52,384
Was on the day that Maria returned.

365
00:20:52,419 --> 00:20:53,629
Wait, papa!

366
00:20:53,670 --> 00:20:55,550
Playing all night with those
mariachis brothers!

367
00:20:55,923 --> 00:20:58,013
You want to end up like those bozos?

368
00:20:59,009 --> 00:21:01,639
Okay, Manny, we'll wait outside.

369
00:21:01,678 --> 00:21:04,008
- I don't think Mr. Sanchez likes us.
- You think?

370
00:21:04,056 --> 00:21:05,176
Quiet, you lazy bums!

371
00:21:07,351 --> 00:21:08,351
You live under my roof...

372
00:21:08,644 --> 00:21:10,154
You live under my rules.

373
00:21:10,187 --> 00:21:11,477
You will be a matador!

374
00:21:11,522 --> 00:21:13,272
Papa, this is my life.

375
00:21:13,315 --> 00:21:16,575
All the sanchezes are bullfighters!

376
00:21:16,860 --> 00:21:18,530
Every single one of us.

377
00:21:20,656 --> 00:21:24,576
I was a beast in the arena. A beast!

378
00:21:25,035 --> 00:21:28,115
It's in your blood. It's your destiny.

379
00:21:28,163 --> 00:21:30,173
How many times do I have to say it?

380
00:21:30,707 --> 00:21:32,877
This is not me. This is you.

381
00:21:32,918 --> 00:21:35,708
My son,
joaquin may be the hero of the town...

382
00:21:35,754 --> 00:21:38,514
But today,
you will be the hero of the ring.

383
00:21:38,549 --> 00:21:41,889
If, for once,
you actually finish the bull.

384
00:21:41,927 --> 00:21:44,347
But he finished the bull
the other day in practice!

385
00:21:47,349 --> 00:21:48,349
That did no count.

386
00:21:48,350 --> 00:21:50,980
No. Killing the bull is wrong.

387
00:21:51,019 --> 00:21:52,099
Here we go again.

388
00:21:52,688 --> 00:21:56,858
Kids today, with their long hair
and their no killing stuff.

389
00:21:56,900 --> 00:21:58,190
I'm out of here.

390
00:21:58,235 --> 00:22:00,535
Don't you love your family?

391
00:22:03,365 --> 00:22:06,025
Then go get that bull, mijo.

392
00:22:06,076 --> 00:22:07,906
Don't dishonor our name.

393
00:22:13,709 --> 00:22:15,879
Just be a Sanchez!

394
00:22:16,378 --> 00:22:17,248
Mijo...

395
00:22:17,296 --> 00:22:19,916
He no gonna do it.

396
00:22:20,757 --> 00:22:22,927
Hey, Manolo!

397
00:22:23,802 --> 00:22:25,432
No retreat.

398
00:22:25,929 --> 00:22:27,309
No surrender.

399
00:22:27,556 --> 00:22:29,056
The hero of San angel returns!

400
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:30,600
Oh, come on.

401
00:22:30,601 --> 00:22:33,061
You didn't think I was gonna miss
your first little bullfight, did you?

402
00:22:33,103 --> 00:22:34,273
And Maria's here, too!

403
00:22:35,105 --> 00:22:37,895
Have you seen her?
I cannot wait to show her these babies.

404
00:22:37,941 --> 00:22:40,531
So, she's back only to see you?

405
00:22:40,569 --> 00:22:41,399
Come on. That's not...

406
00:22:41,445 --> 00:22:43,745
you have your medals,
but I have the bullring.

407
00:22:43,780 --> 00:22:45,280
We'll see which Maria prefers.

408
00:22:45,908 --> 00:22:48,828
It's a good thing you're finally taking
bullfighting seriously.

409
00:22:48,869 --> 00:22:52,659
You should see me in the bullring.
That's where I really do my thing now.

410
00:22:52,706 --> 00:22:54,286
A true Sanchez man.

411
00:22:55,292 --> 00:22:57,542
Those are some big shadows
we live under, huh, buddy?

412
00:22:58,295 --> 00:22:59,885
Huge.

413
00:23:02,966 --> 00:23:05,966
Hey, brother,
may the best man win Maria.

414
00:23:06,637 --> 00:23:08,257
Joaquin!

415
00:23:08,305 --> 00:23:10,605
In honor of Maria's
return from Europe...

416
00:23:10,641 --> 00:23:14,601
The town received a rare visit
from its most noble son...

417
00:23:14,645 --> 00:23:17,275
Who was now a decorated hero.

418
00:23:17,314 --> 00:23:21,824
They say joaquin goes from town to town
saving them from bandits!

419
00:23:35,624 --> 00:23:36,624
Yes!

420
00:23:36,667 --> 00:23:38,127
That's my boy.

421
00:23:42,506 --> 00:23:44,126
Afternoon, my general.

422
00:23:44,174 --> 00:23:46,134
That is a mighty moustache you have.

423
00:23:52,307 --> 00:23:53,427
As expected...

424
00:23:53,475 --> 00:23:56,935
Everyone in town was curious
to see how the young Maria had grown.

425
00:23:57,604 --> 00:23:59,194
The jewel of the town has returned.

426
00:23:59,940 --> 00:24:02,820
And she's going to be helping
at the orphanage.

427
00:24:02,860 --> 00:24:06,820
And I hear she reads books,
like, for fun.

428
00:24:06,864 --> 00:24:07,864
No way!

429
00:24:08,532 --> 00:24:10,372
Señorita posada.

430
00:24:11,702 --> 00:24:12,702
Hola, joaquin.

431
00:24:13,370 --> 00:24:14,830
It's really nice to see you.

432
00:24:17,499 --> 00:24:20,209
And she's so natural!

433
00:24:23,881 --> 00:24:24,881
What?

434
00:24:32,389 --> 00:24:34,019
And they say Manolo...

435
00:24:34,057 --> 00:24:36,227
Might be the greatest Sanchez ever!

436
00:24:37,561 --> 00:24:38,191
Yeah!

437
00:24:38,228 --> 00:24:39,768
That's my boy!

438
00:24:39,813 --> 00:24:41,023
What?

439
00:24:41,857 --> 00:24:45,027
I would like to dedicate this corrida...

440
00:24:45,068 --> 00:24:46,318
To miss Maria posada.

441
00:24:47,196 --> 00:24:49,236
Welcome home, señorita.

442
00:24:55,412 --> 00:24:57,372
I'm allergic to dying!

443
00:24:57,414 --> 00:24:59,754
Especially in the face!

444
00:25:20,187 --> 00:25:21,647
Now, that's a Sanchez!

445
00:25:28,070 --> 00:25:29,070
Manolo!

446
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:39,870
Wow.

447
00:25:40,249 --> 00:25:41,329
That's my son!

448
00:26:01,895 --> 00:26:05,015
Manolo! Manolo!

449
00:26:11,071 --> 00:26:12,071
Come on, mijo.

450
00:26:13,031 --> 00:26:14,071
For me.

451
00:26:14,116 --> 00:26:16,946
For our family. Be a Sanchez!

452
00:26:37,890 --> 00:26:39,020
No.

453
00:26:41,101 --> 00:26:42,891
Killing the bull is wrong!

454
00:26:51,612 --> 00:26:52,362
See?

455
00:26:52,404 --> 00:26:54,034
I told you he no do it.

456
00:26:56,116 --> 00:26:57,366
Bravo!

457
00:26:57,409 --> 00:26:58,409
Bravo!

458
00:26:58,827 --> 00:27:00,907
We don't have to kill the bull!

459
00:27:01,163 --> 00:27:02,913
Oh, no. Manolo.

460
00:27:03,498 --> 00:27:04,748
Adios, Maria.

461
00:27:06,502 --> 00:27:07,882
Manolo.

462
00:27:07,920 --> 00:27:09,920
Manolo. Get up!

463
00:27:14,051 --> 00:27:14,971
I'm sorry, papa.

464
00:27:15,010 --> 00:27:16,640
Do not make it worse by apologizing!

465
00:27:16,678 --> 00:27:19,758
A Sanchez man never apologizes! Never!

466
00:27:19,806 --> 00:27:21,136
Ever.

467
00:27:21,183 --> 00:27:23,733
If being a bullfighter means...

468
00:27:23,769 --> 00:27:25,979
Killing the bull...

469
00:27:26,021 --> 00:27:28,981
Well, then, I'm no bullfighter.

470
00:27:29,024 --> 00:27:32,194
No. You are no Sanchez.

471
00:27:46,416 --> 00:27:47,786
Victory!

472
00:27:49,586 --> 00:27:51,876
That poor kid never had a chance,
my dear.

473
00:27:51,922 --> 00:27:53,132
Good game, though.

474
00:27:53,173 --> 00:27:54,883
It's not over.

475
00:27:56,093 --> 00:27:57,723
Ay, Maria.

476
00:27:58,470 --> 00:28:00,510
When you were here before

477
00:28:03,141 --> 00:28:05,351
couldn't look you in the eye

478
00:28:08,063 --> 00:28:10,523
you're just like an angel

479
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:16,200
your skin makes me cry

480
00:28:18,740 --> 00:28:21,280
but I'm a creep

481
00:28:24,121 --> 00:28:27,791
I'm a weirdo

482
00:28:29,293 --> 00:28:33,133
what am I doing here?

483
00:28:34,631 --> 00:28:37,931
I don't belong here

484
00:28:39,887 --> 00:28:44,387
I don't belong

485
00:28:46,310 --> 00:28:47,310
Manolo.

486
00:28:47,311 --> 00:28:49,811
Maria!

487
00:28:53,942 --> 00:28:55,442
What just happened?

488
00:28:55,903 --> 00:28:58,663
You don't know women, my love.

489
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:04,540
That night, general posada threw
a grand party to welcome Maria back.

490
00:29:04,578 --> 00:29:08,038
But, you see, he had bigger plans.

491
00:29:08,081 --> 00:29:09,541
To joaquin!

492
00:29:09,583 --> 00:29:11,463
A great hero!

493
00:29:11,502 --> 00:29:13,802
Too bad you're just in town
for a few days.

494
00:29:13,837 --> 00:29:17,127
If only there were something
that would make you stay...

495
00:29:17,174 --> 00:29:19,054
Like a special girl.

496
00:29:19,092 --> 00:29:20,142
Eh, Maria?

497
00:29:20,177 --> 00:29:21,087
Papa!

498
00:29:21,136 --> 00:29:22,676
What? What I say?

499
00:29:26,183 --> 00:29:27,773
Oh, my father.

500
00:29:27,809 --> 00:29:31,439
It's so wonderful to see you again,
joaquin.

501
00:29:31,480 --> 00:29:35,570
Look at that mustache.
And all those medals.

502
00:29:35,609 --> 00:29:37,279
What's this one for?

503
00:29:37,319 --> 00:29:38,489
Nothing! Nothing, nothing.

504
00:29:38,779 --> 00:29:39,779
What? I didn't...

505
00:29:41,865 --> 00:29:46,155
why don't you tell me
a little more about europa?

506
00:29:46,203 --> 00:29:48,623
I loved it.

507
00:29:48,664 --> 00:29:52,464
Such beautiful music and art and books.
It was wonderful.

508
00:29:53,627 --> 00:29:56,167
Books, art, wonderfulness.

509
00:29:56,213 --> 00:29:58,383
You sound like you've learned
so much, Maria.

510
00:29:58,423 --> 00:30:00,053
I'm sure one day...

511
00:30:00,092 --> 00:30:02,342
You are going to make a man
very, very, very happy.

512
00:30:02,386 --> 00:30:05,006
And I hope that man's mustache,
or his medals...

513
00:30:05,055 --> 00:30:07,015
Makes you very, very, very, very happy.

514
00:30:07,057 --> 00:30:09,177
Oh, is that so?

515
00:30:09,226 --> 00:30:10,516
Well, yes.

516
00:30:10,561 --> 00:30:14,611
Behind every man with an amazing
mustache is a beautiful woman.

517
00:30:16,024 --> 00:30:17,074
Oh, yes.

518
00:30:17,109 --> 00:30:19,189
And I'll cook and clean for him...

519
00:30:19,236 --> 00:30:21,196
And be at his Beck and call.

520
00:30:21,864 --> 00:30:25,494
That sounds so good.
That just sounds so good.

521
00:30:25,534 --> 00:30:27,124
And you sound...
You're just so pretty.

522
00:30:27,744 --> 00:30:28,744
Are you kidding me?

523
00:30:29,454 --> 00:30:30,374
Oh, boy.

524
00:30:30,414 --> 00:30:32,124
Is that how you see a woman?

525
00:30:33,542 --> 00:30:35,092
We're only here to make men happy?

526
00:30:36,753 --> 00:30:38,253
Yeah.

527
00:30:39,089 --> 00:30:41,219
So, I don't know.

528
00:30:41,258 --> 00:30:44,218
I believe I have lost my appetite.

529
00:30:44,261 --> 00:30:46,851
No, please, please, stay seated.

530
00:30:46,889 --> 00:30:51,229
Now, if you will just excuse me,
I must go check on chuy.

531
00:30:51,268 --> 00:30:53,188
That's my pig.

532
00:30:53,228 --> 00:30:56,938
I need to spend time
with someone civilized.

533
00:30:58,734 --> 00:31:00,944
You've picked yourself a feisty one.

534
00:31:03,071 --> 00:31:06,031
Good one, joaquin! Very witty.

535
00:31:06,074 --> 00:31:09,084
I can't believe the general invited
the whole town!

536
00:31:09,578 --> 00:31:11,248
Except for you, Manolo.

537
00:31:11,622 --> 00:31:13,082
Sorry, bro.

538
00:31:13,123 --> 00:31:14,713
He even invited us.

539
00:31:14,750 --> 00:31:16,460
And he hates us.

540
00:31:16,793 --> 00:31:19,253
It's hopeless. I've lost her to joaquin.

541
00:31:19,296 --> 00:31:21,966
Okay, listen.
All we got to do is play the right song...

542
00:31:22,007 --> 00:31:26,217
And trust me, everything will turn around
in the space of four bars.

543
00:31:26,261 --> 00:31:28,431
We've already been to four bars!

544
00:31:28,472 --> 00:31:29,512
Twice!

545
00:31:29,973 --> 00:31:32,603
Hold it. I know exactly what to play.

546
00:31:32,643 --> 00:31:33,643
It has to be romantic...

547
00:31:33,977 --> 00:31:35,057
And classy...

548
00:31:35,103 --> 00:31:37,483
But with tons of dignity.

549
00:31:41,276 --> 00:31:46,446
You, you got what I need

550
00:31:46,490 --> 00:31:49,280
but you say he's just a friend

551
00:31:49,326 --> 00:31:51,446
but you say he's just a friend

552
00:31:51,495 --> 00:31:53,295
oh, baby, you...

553
00:31:58,001 --> 00:31:59,841
wow, that totally captivated her.

554
00:31:59,878 --> 00:32:01,838
I don't get it. That one always works.

555
00:32:01,880 --> 00:32:03,340
Even on my wife.

556
00:32:04,007 --> 00:32:05,717
Wait. You're married?

557
00:32:06,176 --> 00:32:08,216
I got it! Follow my lead.

558
00:32:09,513 --> 00:32:13,023
If you want my body
and you think I'm sexy

559
00:32:13,058 --> 00:32:15,478
mami vamos, let me know

560
00:32:25,487 --> 00:32:27,027
very romantic, pepe.

561
00:32:29,700 --> 00:32:30,620
That's all I got, mang.

562
00:32:30,659 --> 00:32:31,989
Okay, my turn!

563
00:32:32,035 --> 00:32:35,035
One, two,
one, two, tres, cuatro!

564
00:32:35,747 --> 00:32:38,287
That girl is way out of your league, bro.

565
00:32:38,333 --> 00:32:39,503
Hey, let's eat!

566
00:33:09,615 --> 00:33:13,205
I love you too much

567
00:33:13,243 --> 00:33:16,663
to live without you loving me back

568
00:33:16,705 --> 00:33:19,455
I love you too much

569
00:33:20,417 --> 00:33:21,837
heaven's my witness

570
00:33:21,877 --> 00:33:23,587
and this is a fact

571
00:33:23,629 --> 00:33:26,879
I know I belong

572
00:33:26,924 --> 00:33:29,974
when I sing this song

573
00:33:30,594 --> 00:33:32,934
there's love above love and it's ours

574
00:33:32,971 --> 00:33:36,471
'cause I love you too much

575
00:33:37,518 --> 00:33:40,688
I live for your touch

576
00:33:41,438 --> 00:33:44,358
I whisper your name night after night

577
00:33:44,983 --> 00:33:47,943
I love you too much

578
00:33:47,986 --> 00:33:51,446
there's only one feeling
and I know it's right

579
00:33:51,490 --> 00:33:54,280
I know I belong

580
00:33:55,035 --> 00:33:57,535
when I sing this song

581
00:33:58,455 --> 00:34:03,785
there's love above love and it's ours
'cause I love you too much

582
00:34:06,505 --> 00:34:11,685
heaven knows your name
I've been praying

583
00:34:12,302 --> 00:34:16,722
to have you come here by my side

584
00:34:20,477 --> 00:34:25,647
without you a part of me's missing

585
00:34:25,983 --> 00:34:32,663
just to make you my own I will fight

586
00:34:33,240 --> 00:34:38,500
I love you too much

587
00:34:40,163 --> 00:34:43,333
I love you too much

588
00:34:44,001 --> 00:34:47,131
heaven's my witness and this is a fact

589
00:34:47,171 --> 00:34:50,511
you live in my soul

590
00:34:50,549 --> 00:34:53,009
your heart is my goal

591
00:34:54,052 --> 00:34:55,182
there's love above love

592
00:34:55,554 --> 00:34:57,644
and it's mine
'cause I love you

593
00:34:57,681 --> 00:35:01,021
there's love above love and it's yours
'cause I love you

594
00:35:01,059 --> 00:35:04,189
there's love above love and it's ours

595
00:35:04,229 --> 00:35:08,689
if you love me as much

596
00:35:11,612 --> 00:35:13,212
did you think it was gonna be that easy?

597
00:35:19,119 --> 00:35:21,119
I kind of did.

598
00:35:22,372 --> 00:35:24,212
Manolo!

599
00:35:25,042 --> 00:35:26,382
Hold on, I'm coming.

600
00:35:33,342 --> 00:35:34,342
Joaquin.

601
00:35:35,552 --> 00:35:36,792
- What are you doing?
- Maria...

602
00:35:38,764 --> 00:35:41,434
Will you marry me?

603
00:35:42,684 --> 00:35:43,854
Yes.

604
00:35:44,269 --> 00:35:46,729
Don't worry,
your father already said you could.

605
00:35:46,772 --> 00:35:49,022
He did... what?

606
00:35:50,609 --> 00:35:53,239
Who else could protect us from chakal?

607
00:36:08,627 --> 00:36:10,087
What did I miss?

608
00:36:11,296 --> 00:36:12,586
Wait a sec.

609
00:36:12,923 --> 00:36:15,223
Did he propose, too?

610
00:36:15,259 --> 00:36:16,549
No.

611
00:36:16,593 --> 00:36:18,013
Were you going to?

612
00:36:18,053 --> 00:36:18,763
What?

613
00:36:18,804 --> 00:36:22,854
Well, I proposed first.
So, go fight a bull or something.

614
00:36:22,891 --> 00:36:24,681
You two are acting like fools!

615
00:36:24,726 --> 00:36:25,806
Wait, me too?

616
00:36:27,145 --> 00:36:29,055
You're so strong, joaquin.

617
00:36:29,106 --> 00:36:30,896
Thanks, I work out a lot.

618
00:36:31,441 --> 00:36:32,731
I love you, you know that.

619
00:36:32,776 --> 00:36:34,236
But how are you
going to protect Maria...

620
00:36:34,278 --> 00:36:36,318
If you can't even finish a bull?

621
00:36:38,615 --> 00:36:40,025
Good one, joaquin!

622
00:36:40,075 --> 00:36:43,655
Oh, yeah? Well, you will never be
as great a hero as your father!

623
00:36:46,790 --> 00:36:48,250
Now, that's just uncalled for.

624
00:36:48,292 --> 00:36:49,962
You better get your finger
out of my face.

625
00:36:50,002 --> 00:36:53,422
- You don't point at me!
- I'm the best pointer you've ever seen!

626
00:36:53,463 --> 00:36:56,013
That's so stupid, so childish.

627
00:36:56,049 --> 00:36:57,129
Joaquin!

628
00:36:58,302 --> 00:36:59,512
Come at me, bro!

629
00:36:59,553 --> 00:37:00,893
Manolo!

630
00:37:03,307 --> 00:37:04,017
What?

631
00:37:04,057 --> 00:37:05,727
- You wanted a banjo?
- Look at him!

632
00:37:05,767 --> 00:37:07,937
He got his guitar.
What are you gonna do?

633
00:37:07,978 --> 00:37:09,438
LA música!
I'm so scared!

634
00:37:09,813 --> 00:37:11,563
I'm gonna teach you some manners.

635
00:37:11,815 --> 00:37:12,815
Joaquin!

636
00:37:17,654 --> 00:37:19,954
Did I mention I also studied fencing?

637
00:37:19,990 --> 00:37:22,120
Fine. We'll settle this later.

638
00:37:22,159 --> 00:37:24,159
Any time. Any place.

639
00:37:24,745 --> 00:37:25,755
Really, guys?

640
00:37:26,496 --> 00:37:27,786
No!

641
00:37:27,831 --> 00:37:29,541
Don't go, joaquin!

642
00:37:29,583 --> 00:37:30,753
What if the bandidos come?

643
00:37:32,336 --> 00:37:34,706
The bandidos are coming!

644
00:37:34,755 --> 00:37:36,305
And joaquin is gone!

645
00:37:36,340 --> 00:37:38,430
All is lost

646
00:37:41,512 --> 00:37:46,272
tremble in fear
before the might of chakal's army!

647
00:37:46,308 --> 00:37:48,888
Women and children, go to the church!

648
00:37:48,936 --> 00:37:52,266
Men, we are going to drive
chakal's bandits off!

649
00:37:52,314 --> 00:37:54,694
Who is with me?

650
00:37:57,819 --> 00:37:59,069
This is not good.

651
00:37:59,112 --> 00:38:00,822
Listen up, you cowards!

652
00:38:00,864 --> 00:38:04,664
These are chakal's demands!

653
00:38:04,701 --> 00:38:06,331
"Hand over your chickens...

654
00:38:06,370 --> 00:38:07,370
"Monies...

655
00:38:07,371 --> 00:38:08,291
"Bacon...

656
00:38:08,330 --> 00:38:09,250
"Jars...

657
00:38:09,289 --> 00:38:10,789
"Mustache wax."

658
00:38:10,832 --> 00:38:13,712
This looks like "jelly"
but I think it's "jewelry."

659
00:38:14,336 --> 00:38:15,376
Yeah, jewelry.

660
00:38:15,629 --> 00:38:18,669
Anyways, if you give all this to us...

661
00:38:18,715 --> 00:38:21,335
Then maybe we won't burn...

662
00:38:21,385 --> 00:38:22,685
Your town down.

663
00:38:24,805 --> 00:38:28,685
You want the town?
You're gonna have to go through me!

664
00:38:29,977 --> 00:38:31,807
Hey, ugly!

665
00:38:31,854 --> 00:38:33,774
Why don't you fight a real man?

666
00:38:33,814 --> 00:38:36,824
With a really awesome mustache!

667
00:38:36,859 --> 00:38:39,649
Joaquin!

668
00:38:42,865 --> 00:38:44,955
Thank goodness you are here!

669
00:38:46,368 --> 00:38:47,868
Here, hold this.

670
00:38:47,911 --> 00:38:49,911
And this. And this.

671
00:38:49,955 --> 00:38:53,635
And if that's too heavy,
maybe you can just hand it to Maria.

672
00:38:54,209 --> 00:38:58,049
My name is joaquin,
son of captain mondragon!

673
00:38:58,088 --> 00:39:00,718
Tonight, the town of San angel...

674
00:39:00,757 --> 00:39:03,047
Is under my protection.

675
00:39:03,927 --> 00:39:04,927
Prepare to be beaten.

676
00:39:06,096 --> 00:39:07,096
Get him, plomo!

677
00:39:09,266 --> 00:39:10,846
Joaquin!

678
00:39:10,893 --> 00:39:11,893
Joaquin!

679
00:39:13,061 --> 00:39:15,361
Who wants some more?

680
00:39:15,397 --> 00:39:16,977
Get him!

681
00:39:17,900 --> 00:39:18,900
Hey, girl.

682
00:39:19,568 --> 00:39:20,688
You goofball.

683
00:39:26,909 --> 00:39:28,619
All right,
that's just not hurting at all.

684
00:39:28,660 --> 00:39:29,740
The beautiful hero!

685
00:39:29,786 --> 00:39:31,996
He has the medal of everlasting life!

686
00:39:32,748 --> 00:39:35,208
Joaquin!

687
00:39:42,049 --> 00:39:43,679
Retreat!

688
00:39:43,717 --> 00:39:45,387
And don't ever come back!

689
00:39:45,844 --> 00:39:48,014
Yeah! You better run away!

690
00:39:48,055 --> 00:39:49,265
That was incredible.

691
00:39:49,306 --> 00:39:51,766
Yeah, you really are a hero.

692
00:39:52,643 --> 00:39:53,893
Perhaps now...

693
00:39:53,936 --> 00:39:58,146
We possibly could continue
our conversation, señorita posada?

694
00:39:58,857 --> 00:40:02,687
Maria, please, do it for the town.

695
00:40:02,736 --> 00:40:04,236
Without joaquin...

696
00:40:04,279 --> 00:40:06,659
We are at the mercy of chakal.

697
00:40:08,534 --> 00:40:12,544
So, why don't you tell me about
some of your medals?

698
00:40:13,205 --> 00:40:16,425
Well, I got this one
for delivering a baby with one hand...

699
00:40:16,458 --> 00:40:18,748
While arm wrestling a bear with the other.
That's nothing, really.

700
00:40:18,794 --> 00:40:21,214
Duh. Of course she's gonna go
with joaquin.

701
00:40:21,255 --> 00:40:22,845
And did you see that mustache?

702
00:40:22,881 --> 00:40:23,881
Are you crazy?

703
00:40:23,924 --> 00:40:25,804
Maria is doing this to protect the town.

704
00:40:25,843 --> 00:40:28,393
- Putting her duty before her heart.
- Yes.

705
00:40:29,012 --> 00:40:31,472
Life can be really tough for the living.

706
00:40:31,515 --> 00:40:34,235
Failing in and out of the ring.

707
00:40:34,268 --> 00:40:37,268
The whole Sanchez family
would be so...

708
00:40:37,312 --> 00:40:38,652
Disappointed in you.

709
00:40:39,940 --> 00:40:41,780
Please, don't say that.

710
00:40:42,526 --> 00:40:44,526
Listen. You love Maria?

711
00:40:44,570 --> 00:40:46,360
Then fight for her, like a man!

712
00:40:47,573 --> 00:40:50,873
It's too late.
Joaquin proposed to her already.

713
00:40:50,909 --> 00:40:52,949
- Now, that's a real man.
- Quiet, Carlos!

714
00:40:53,620 --> 00:40:54,790
Manolo...

715
00:40:54,830 --> 00:40:57,790
If Maria didn't say yes to joaquin...

716
00:40:57,833 --> 00:40:59,583
Then she said no.

717
00:40:59,960 --> 00:41:02,670
So, what are you gonna do about it, son?

718
00:41:07,885 --> 00:41:10,515
After stealing xibalba's magic medal
in a battle...

719
00:41:10,554 --> 00:41:13,144
Chakal had risen to become
the king of the bandits.

720
00:41:13,182 --> 00:41:17,062
But when xibalba stole it back,
chakal had come undone.

721
00:41:18,520 --> 00:41:22,980
We found the medal!
The medal of everlasting life!

722
00:41:23,025 --> 00:41:24,785
It's in the town of San angel.

723
00:41:26,153 --> 00:41:28,533
- Are you certain?
- I swear! I swear!

724
00:41:28,572 --> 00:41:30,992
A beautiful hero wears it
to protect the town!

725
00:41:31,033 --> 00:41:32,913
It looked just like that.

726
00:41:33,452 --> 00:41:35,202
Gather my men.

727
00:41:35,245 --> 00:41:37,155
We ride for San angel.

728
00:41:38,081 --> 00:41:42,541
You've come back to me, medal.

729
00:41:42,586 --> 00:41:44,546
I got this one for saving some orphans
from a fire...

730
00:41:44,588 --> 00:41:46,798
And then going back in for their cribs,
and then going back in for their toys.

731
00:41:46,840 --> 00:41:48,840
And then I also saved a little puppy one
time that had a little Thorn in its paw.

732
00:41:48,884 --> 00:41:51,014
And this medal is for
having the most medals.

733
00:41:51,053 --> 00:41:52,683
Well, here we are.

734
00:41:52,721 --> 00:41:57,311
Thank you for this most informative
talk about you.

735
00:41:57,976 --> 00:41:59,766
I have something for you, Maria.

736
00:41:59,811 --> 00:42:01,601
That is so nice of...

737
00:42:02,898 --> 00:42:03,938
Wow.

738
00:42:03,982 --> 00:42:04,982
I'm speechless.

739
00:42:04,983 --> 00:42:07,363
I know. Right? I get that a lot.

740
00:42:08,904 --> 00:42:10,784
Good night, joaquin.

741
00:42:11,865 --> 00:42:12,865
Wait. Maria.

742
00:42:12,866 --> 00:42:13,866
Yes?

743
00:42:14,451 --> 00:42:16,241
My bonnet.

744
00:42:17,871 --> 00:42:19,871
You kept it all this time?

745
00:42:19,915 --> 00:42:22,465
Well, it's what's kept me going.

746
00:42:24,211 --> 00:42:28,261
About my proposal,
will you at least just think about it?

747
00:42:31,510 --> 00:42:33,510
Good night, joaquin.

748
00:42:33,554 --> 00:42:35,644
Yes! Yes, yes, yes!

749
00:42:35,681 --> 00:42:37,101
Joaquin, you're awesome!

750
00:42:37,140 --> 00:42:38,140
Yes!

751
00:42:47,359 --> 00:42:49,279
Meet me at the bridge at dawn.

752
00:42:49,319 --> 00:42:50,739
I can't. My father won't...

753
00:42:50,779 --> 00:42:53,319
please, Maria. I beg you.

754
00:43:01,999 --> 00:43:03,039
If she meets him alone...

755
00:43:03,083 --> 00:43:04,713
I will lose the wager.

756
00:43:06,086 --> 00:43:09,416
Fix this for me, old friend.

757
00:43:32,905 --> 00:43:33,955
Manolo.

758
00:43:33,989 --> 00:43:38,029
Wise men say...

759
00:43:38,577 --> 00:43:43,457
Only fools rush in

760
00:43:44,208 --> 00:43:46,918
but I can't help...

761
00:43:48,378 --> 00:43:52,088
Falling in love with you

762
00:43:54,843 --> 00:43:58,813
but I can't help...

763
00:43:58,847 --> 00:44:01,097
Falling in love...

764
00:44:01,558 --> 00:44:05,938
With you

765
00:44:12,903 --> 00:44:16,913
this is what I wanted to show you.

766
00:44:17,824 --> 00:44:20,414
It's so beautiful.

767
00:44:22,162 --> 00:44:23,792
What you're feeling...

768
00:44:23,830 --> 00:44:26,790
That's how I feel
every time I'm with you.

769
00:44:27,876 --> 00:44:29,706
I can't offer you a ring.

770
00:44:29,753 --> 00:44:32,673
I have nothing to give but my love.

771
00:44:32,714 --> 00:44:34,384
Oh, Manolo.

772
00:44:34,424 --> 00:44:36,434
I may not be the town hero, Maria...

773
00:44:36,468 --> 00:44:39,258
But I swear with all my heart...

774
00:44:39,304 --> 00:44:42,024
I will never, ever stop loving you.

775
00:44:43,600 --> 00:44:45,350
And I will never stop loving the man...

776
00:44:45,394 --> 00:44:47,604
Who plays from the heart.

777
00:44:49,356 --> 00:44:50,516
- Snake!
- No!

778
00:44:53,110 --> 00:44:54,110
Maria!

779
00:45:02,953 --> 00:45:03,953
No.

780
00:45:07,666 --> 00:45:08,876
Help!

781
00:45:25,601 --> 00:45:27,141
What did you do, Manolo?

782
00:45:27,686 --> 00:45:29,096
There was a snake and...

783
00:45:30,939 --> 00:45:32,189
She's gone.

784
00:45:32,232 --> 00:45:33,482
Why didn't you protect her?

785
00:45:33,525 --> 00:45:34,435
Maria!

786
00:45:34,484 --> 00:45:37,784
Oh, no. Oh, no!

787
00:45:40,490 --> 00:45:42,620
This is all your doing! Leave!

788
00:45:42,659 --> 00:45:45,289
Or so help me, I'll...

789
00:45:46,580 --> 00:45:48,580
my little girl.

790
00:45:49,041 --> 00:45:51,081
What have you done, boy?

791
00:45:51,793 --> 00:45:53,923
What have you done?

792
00:45:53,962 --> 00:45:55,632
It should have been me.

793
00:45:55,672 --> 00:45:58,172
Yes. It should have.

794
00:46:01,845 --> 00:46:03,045
No!

795
00:46:03,096 --> 00:46:04,346
Maria died?

796
00:46:04,389 --> 00:46:05,719
That can't be right!

797
00:46:05,766 --> 00:46:08,056
What kind of story is this?
We're just kids!

798
00:46:09,436 --> 00:46:12,106
As the sky cried with rain...

799
00:46:12,147 --> 00:46:15,227
Manolo went back to retrieve his guitar.

800
00:46:16,318 --> 00:46:18,648
I will never see her again.

801
00:46:20,322 --> 00:46:21,362
Are you certain?

802
00:46:22,866 --> 00:46:26,156
You want to see Maria again?

803
00:46:26,703 --> 00:46:28,503
With all my heart.

804
00:46:28,539 --> 00:46:29,909
Think about what you say...

805
00:46:30,332 --> 00:46:31,792
Boy.

806
00:46:35,045 --> 00:46:38,205
With all my heart.

807
00:46:38,841 --> 00:46:39,841
Done.

808
00:46:44,054 --> 00:46:45,434
Maria...

809
00:46:51,478 --> 00:46:52,728
No!

810
00:46:52,771 --> 00:46:54,061
Manolo, too?

811
00:46:54,106 --> 00:46:56,066
What is it with Mexicans and death?

812
00:46:56,108 --> 00:46:59,028
But it can't end like this. Can it?

813
00:46:59,319 --> 00:47:02,319
Oh, my sweet child,
this is not the end.

814
00:47:38,525 --> 00:47:39,395
Welcome...

815
00:47:39,443 --> 00:47:42,823
To the land of the remembered!

816
00:47:42,863 --> 00:47:44,203
I made it.

817
00:47:44,239 --> 00:47:45,569
And on the day of the dead, no less.

818
00:47:45,616 --> 00:47:47,156
Where is...

819
00:47:47,201 --> 00:47:49,121
You're going to be
a little disoriented at first.

820
00:47:49,161 --> 00:47:51,751
Don't try to take it all in at once.

821
00:47:51,788 --> 00:47:53,418
Let's start with your name.

822
00:47:53,707 --> 00:47:54,577
Maria posada!

823
00:47:54,625 --> 00:47:55,715
Really?

824
00:47:55,751 --> 00:47:58,341
Parents and their crazy baby names.

825
00:47:58,378 --> 00:48:01,338
And there's no Maria posada on my list.

826
00:48:01,381 --> 00:48:02,721
No, no.

827
00:48:02,758 --> 00:48:05,298
I'm looking for Maria posada.

828
00:48:05,969 --> 00:48:07,509
My name is Manolo Sanchez.

829
00:48:08,013 --> 00:48:09,263
Another Sanchez?

830
00:48:09,306 --> 00:48:11,056
Man, that family just keeps growing.

831
00:48:11,099 --> 00:48:13,019
My family! They'll help me find Maria!

832
00:48:13,060 --> 00:48:14,810
Can you take me to them?

833
00:48:14,853 --> 00:48:17,773
I would love nothing more
than to reunite a young couple.

834
00:48:17,814 --> 00:48:21,324
Just hold on!

835
00:48:29,034 --> 00:48:32,664
I've been down here for years...

836
00:48:32,704 --> 00:48:34,084
Awaiting my beloved honey bunny.

837
00:48:34,456 --> 00:48:35,996
Hi, honey!

838
00:48:36,583 --> 00:48:37,833
Too soon! Go!

839
00:48:39,753 --> 00:48:43,133
The land of the remembered
was vibrant and joyous!

840
00:48:43,173 --> 00:48:44,923
Everything was like the land above...

841
00:48:44,967 --> 00:48:47,007
But it was more colorful...

842
00:48:47,052 --> 00:48:49,642
It was more beautiful,
it was more festive!

843
00:48:49,680 --> 00:48:51,220
And, on the day of the dead...

844
00:48:51,265 --> 00:48:55,895
That place was bursting with
endless parties and spectacular parades.

845
00:48:55,936 --> 00:48:57,936
There, your family is in that one.

846
00:49:00,023 --> 00:49:01,443
Wow.

847
00:49:01,483 --> 00:49:02,573
Get in there!

848
00:49:07,614 --> 00:49:08,704
Oh, yeah!

849
00:49:08,740 --> 00:49:10,780
Another Sanchez bullfighter.

850
00:49:10,826 --> 00:49:11,826
You are...

851
00:49:12,160 --> 00:49:14,750
The amazing carmelo Sanchez!

852
00:49:14,788 --> 00:49:16,208
Yes! I was famous...

853
00:49:16,999 --> 00:49:19,829
For fighting bulls without a cape!

854
00:49:21,461 --> 00:49:23,761
Capes are for cowards!

855
00:49:24,089 --> 00:49:25,879
Can you help me find Maria posada?

856
00:49:25,924 --> 00:49:29,894
LA muerte can help you.
She helps everyone. Hold on.

857
00:49:33,765 --> 00:49:36,885
The great Jorge Sanchez!

858
00:49:36,935 --> 00:49:38,515
At your service!

859
00:49:38,562 --> 00:49:40,522
I was famous for fighting bulls...

860
00:49:40,564 --> 00:49:43,324
With only one arm and one leg.

861
00:49:44,818 --> 00:49:47,068
Arms and legs are for cowards!

862
00:49:48,572 --> 00:49:51,162
You are Manolo,
the one who plays the guitar.

863
00:49:51,200 --> 00:49:52,780
Yeah, that's me.

864
00:49:52,826 --> 00:49:57,866
You know, when I was younger,
I always dreamt of singing in the opera.

865
00:49:57,915 --> 00:49:58,915
You did?

866
00:49:58,916 --> 00:50:00,126
But as you know...

867
00:50:00,167 --> 00:50:04,207
Music is not work
fit for a Sanchez bullfighter.

868
00:50:04,755 --> 00:50:06,055
The same story.

869
00:50:06,089 --> 00:50:08,009
They crushed our dreams. Hilarious.

870
00:50:10,219 --> 00:50:12,679
- He's new.
- He reminds me of me.

871
00:50:12,721 --> 00:50:13,931
But less handsome.

872
00:50:19,561 --> 00:50:20,811
Of course!

873
00:50:20,854 --> 00:50:23,694
It's Luis "El super macho" Sanchez!

874
00:50:23,732 --> 00:50:24,732
I was famous...

875
00:50:25,192 --> 00:50:27,782
For fighting three bulls at once!

876
00:50:30,906 --> 00:50:33,776
One bull is for cowards!

877
00:50:35,035 --> 00:50:37,695
Grandpa! It's me, Manolo.

878
00:50:38,038 --> 00:50:41,418
Manolo? I'm so happy to see you.

879
00:50:41,458 --> 00:50:45,338
Why you disgrace the family name?
Playing the guitar!

880
00:50:45,379 --> 00:50:47,839
You couldn't finish one bull?

881
00:50:47,881 --> 00:50:49,631
You were a clown.

882
00:50:51,051 --> 00:50:52,761
Sorry, cousin chucho.

883
00:50:53,387 --> 00:50:55,217
Welcome home, mijo.

884
00:50:55,264 --> 00:50:58,104
Your mother will be very happy
to see you.

885
00:51:00,561 --> 00:51:01,561
Mama?

886
00:51:09,987 --> 00:51:11,317
Manolo.

887
00:51:12,114 --> 00:51:13,324
Mama.

888
00:51:14,575 --> 00:51:16,335
Manolo!

889
00:51:21,039 --> 00:51:24,329
I missed you so much.

890
00:51:24,710 --> 00:51:27,920
Ay, mijo,
it's been like a hole in my heart.

891
00:51:27,963 --> 00:51:30,513
I've waited so long for you.

892
00:51:31,675 --> 00:51:32,675
But not long enough!

893
00:51:33,051 --> 00:51:34,761
What are you doing here?

894
00:51:34,803 --> 00:51:38,813
I'm here to be reunited
with the love of my life.

895
00:51:38,849 --> 00:51:41,019
You're going to love Maria, mama.

896
00:51:41,518 --> 00:51:43,138
I'm sure I will.

897
00:51:43,187 --> 00:51:46,017
Manolo, you look just like your father.

898
00:51:46,648 --> 00:51:48,688
So handsome, you turned out.

899
00:51:48,734 --> 00:51:52,204
And I became a bullfighter,
just like you wanted.

900
00:51:52,237 --> 00:51:54,317
Me? Are you crazy?

901
00:51:54,364 --> 00:51:56,834
Haven't you learned anything
from your family's history?

902
00:51:56,867 --> 00:51:58,027
What? But dad said that...

903
00:51:58,410 --> 00:51:59,990
that Carlos.

904
00:52:00,037 --> 00:52:02,207
Wait until he gets down here.

905
00:52:02,247 --> 00:52:04,327
Now, come on, mijo!

906
00:52:04,374 --> 00:52:06,214
Everyone, this is my son, Manolo!

907
00:52:10,714 --> 00:52:14,264
And these are your adelita cousins.
They fought in the revolution.

908
00:52:14,718 --> 00:52:15,718
And we won.

909
00:52:15,761 --> 00:52:16,851
No way!

910
00:52:16,887 --> 00:52:18,137
Hey, primo.

911
00:52:18,180 --> 00:52:20,560
Being with the whole Sanchez family...

912
00:52:20,933 --> 00:52:22,853
And you, mama.

913
00:52:22,893 --> 00:52:24,023
This is incredible.

914
00:52:24,061 --> 00:52:26,771
This is LA muerte's castle.

915
00:52:28,398 --> 00:52:29,858
I don't see it.

916
00:52:31,610 --> 00:52:32,860
Savage.

917
00:52:32,903 --> 00:52:35,243
Come, she will help you find
my new daughter-in-law.

918
00:52:40,577 --> 00:52:42,367
It's so pretty!

919
00:52:42,412 --> 00:52:44,372
Now, this is a castle!

920
00:52:44,414 --> 00:52:46,544
We were always LA muerte's favorites.

921
00:52:46,875 --> 00:52:50,045
You know how bullfighters
flirt with death, eh?

922
00:52:50,087 --> 00:52:52,627
And that's why there are
so many of you down here.

923
00:53:00,764 --> 00:53:05,274
LA muerte's throwing a big
day of the dead fiesta for everyone!

924
00:53:08,480 --> 00:53:10,270
Savage.

925
00:53:17,322 --> 00:53:19,322
Ask her, mijo.

926
00:53:19,366 --> 00:53:22,616
My lady,
could you help me find Maria posada?

927
00:53:23,287 --> 00:53:26,247
No one here can help you, bullfighter.

928
00:53:28,292 --> 00:53:30,792
The land of the remembered
has a new ruler!

929
00:53:36,633 --> 00:53:38,763
Who, you ask? Lil' old me.

930
00:53:38,802 --> 00:53:39,932
You again?

931
00:53:39,970 --> 00:53:43,310
But LA muerte would never hand
her domain over to you.

932
00:53:44,349 --> 00:53:45,599
She lost a bet.

933
00:53:45,976 --> 00:53:48,306
Ah. She would do that.

934
00:53:48,353 --> 00:53:50,613
This land is finally mine!

935
00:53:50,647 --> 00:53:52,607
All thanks to you, Manolo.

936
00:53:52,649 --> 00:53:53,439
What?

937
00:53:53,483 --> 00:53:56,113
LA muerte
bet that Maria would marry you.

938
00:53:56,153 --> 00:53:58,953
I bet that Maria would marry joaquin.

939
00:54:00,490 --> 00:54:03,240
And since you're not around anymore...

940
00:54:03,285 --> 00:54:08,085
Maria is going to marry joaquin just to,
you know, protect her beloved town.

941
00:54:08,123 --> 00:54:09,793
So, I win.

942
00:54:09,833 --> 00:54:11,633
No, but Maria passed away.

943
00:54:11,668 --> 00:54:13,248
I saw her.

944
00:54:13,295 --> 00:54:14,805
Oh, no.

945
00:54:14,838 --> 00:54:16,838
Oh, yes.

946
00:54:17,549 --> 00:54:18,969
Mijo, what is it?

947
00:54:19,009 --> 00:54:20,679
One snake bite
merely put her in a trance.

948
00:54:21,637 --> 00:54:24,347
My champion easily woke...

949
00:54:24,806 --> 00:54:26,676
The sleeping beauty.

950
00:54:28,519 --> 00:54:30,809
Oh, my goodness. It's a miracle!

951
00:54:30,854 --> 00:54:32,694
Thank you

952
00:54:33,148 --> 00:54:35,028
I'm... I'm...

953
00:54:35,526 --> 00:54:37,606
Alive.

954
00:54:37,653 --> 00:54:38,653
Cheers.

955
00:54:39,321 --> 00:54:41,531
One bite? Your snake!

956
00:54:41,573 --> 00:54:43,323
It bit me twice!

957
00:54:43,367 --> 00:54:44,487
You cheated!

958
00:54:44,535 --> 00:54:46,335
You will pay for this!

959
00:54:52,251 --> 00:54:54,841
In all my years, no one, in any realm...

960
00:54:54,878 --> 00:54:56,838
Has ever talked to me like that...

961
00:54:56,880 --> 00:54:58,840
And survived.

962
00:54:58,882 --> 00:55:00,472
So, I ask you...

963
00:55:00,509 --> 00:55:02,089
Are you threatening me, boy?

964
00:55:02,511 --> 00:55:04,051
I will expose you to LA muerte.

965
00:55:04,096 --> 00:55:06,676
And then you and me can settle things!

966
00:55:07,558 --> 00:55:09,518
You'll never reach her in her new realm.

967
00:55:09,560 --> 00:55:13,230
I should know. I rotted there for eons.

968
00:55:15,190 --> 00:55:18,740
Now, if you'd all excuse me,
I have a wedding to plan.

969
00:55:33,542 --> 00:55:35,292
What happened?

970
00:55:36,420 --> 00:55:37,920
Wait, where's Manolo?

971
00:55:37,963 --> 00:55:39,423
I'm sorry, Maria.

972
00:55:40,424 --> 00:55:41,634
Manolo...

973
00:55:42,259 --> 00:55:43,259
Manolo passed away.

974
00:55:44,720 --> 00:55:47,430
No. It can't be.

975
00:55:48,724 --> 00:55:50,394
I'm sorry, dear.

976
00:55:58,775 --> 00:56:02,275
Maria, we are all sorry Manolo is gone...

977
00:56:02,779 --> 00:56:05,989
But joaquin just saved your life.

978
00:56:06,033 --> 00:56:09,083
You see? He will always protect you.

979
00:56:09,119 --> 00:56:11,039
General, this is not the time.

980
00:56:12,414 --> 00:56:15,334
Please, for everyone's sake, mija.

981
00:56:15,375 --> 00:56:17,535
Make him stay.

982
00:56:18,962 --> 00:56:21,972
Will you stay in San angel
if I marry you?

983
00:56:22,633 --> 00:56:23,933
Yes, but you don't...

984
00:56:23,967 --> 00:56:26,467
I accept joaquin's proposal.

985
00:56:27,095 --> 00:56:29,635
Ah, young love.

986
00:56:30,474 --> 00:56:32,854
I have to find LA muerte! Please.

987
00:56:32,893 --> 00:56:34,733
Please, help me.

988
00:56:34,770 --> 00:56:36,940
Mijo, stay here with us.

989
00:56:36,980 --> 00:56:37,980
No more worries.

990
00:56:37,981 --> 00:56:39,901
Epic fiestas every day.

991
00:56:39,942 --> 00:56:41,942
With the whole Sanchez family.

992
00:56:41,985 --> 00:56:44,895
And all-you-can-eat churros.

993
00:56:46,073 --> 00:56:48,583
Thank you, guys. But, no.

994
00:56:48,617 --> 00:56:50,447
I need to be with Maria.

995
00:56:50,494 --> 00:56:52,044
It's all I ever wanted.

996
00:56:52,079 --> 00:56:54,289
How's Manolo gonna get back?

997
00:56:54,331 --> 00:56:56,041
He's stuck there forever!

998
00:56:56,083 --> 00:56:57,753
And Maria is gonna marry joaquin!

999
00:56:58,836 --> 00:57:01,496
All right, do you want me to continue?

1000
00:57:01,922 --> 00:57:03,132
So, one thing was for sure...

1001
00:57:03,173 --> 00:57:05,053
Manolo needed help from his family.

1002
00:57:05,092 --> 00:57:07,392
If LA muerte
is where xibalba rotted away...

1003
00:57:07,427 --> 00:57:09,047
Then she's in the land of the forgotten.

1004
00:57:09,096 --> 00:57:11,056
- No, no, no.
- Quiet, you!

1005
00:57:11,098 --> 00:57:15,688
Manolo, there's only one way
to get to the land of the forgotten.

1006
00:57:16,019 --> 00:57:20,319
Through the cave of souls

1007
00:57:20,357 --> 00:57:22,817
going there would be certain doom!

1008
00:57:22,860 --> 00:57:24,780
Well...

1009
00:57:24,820 --> 00:57:26,530
It's a good day for doom.

1010
00:57:28,365 --> 00:57:30,115
He's a Sanchez, I tell you!

1011
00:57:30,158 --> 00:57:32,828
A Sanchez!

1012
00:57:33,328 --> 00:57:35,998
This is impossible!

1013
00:57:36,039 --> 00:57:38,499
Hey! Good luck, little Sanchez!

1014
00:57:38,959 --> 00:57:40,959
The legendary cave of souls...

1015
00:57:41,003 --> 00:57:43,633
Was rumored to be at the edge
of the land of the remembered.

1016
00:57:43,672 --> 00:57:48,472
Now, many had tried to reach it,
but none had ever returned.

1017
00:57:48,510 --> 00:57:49,890
At least, not in one piece.

1018
00:57:55,851 --> 00:57:59,311
Caramba, it hurts just looking at it.

1019
00:58:00,147 --> 00:58:03,187
Why couldn't this be the elevator of souls?

1020
00:58:03,233 --> 00:58:05,243
My arthritis is killing me!

1021
00:58:05,694 --> 00:58:06,904
Are we there yet?

1022
00:58:12,201 --> 00:58:13,991
We made it, mijo.

1023
00:58:14,745 --> 00:58:17,255
Come on! What are you guys waiting for?

1024
00:58:18,248 --> 00:58:20,078
You are not worthy!

1025
00:58:22,002 --> 00:58:24,632
Hey! My arthritis is gone!

1026
00:58:24,671 --> 00:58:25,711
Grandpa!

1027
00:58:28,050 --> 00:58:29,050
Mama!

1028
00:58:31,428 --> 00:58:32,428
Manolo!

1029
00:58:32,763 --> 00:58:34,183
Face the labyrinth...

1030
00:58:34,681 --> 00:58:37,771
And earn the right to be judged.

1031
00:58:51,823 --> 00:58:53,623
I can't see him! Lift me up!

1032
00:58:53,951 --> 00:58:55,041
I see him!

1033
00:58:59,164 --> 00:59:00,164
Where did he go?

1034
00:59:03,502 --> 00:59:04,422
Uh-oh.

1035
00:59:04,461 --> 00:59:06,131
What? What's happening?

1036
00:59:06,171 --> 00:59:08,841
It's okay, honey. He's totally okay.

1037
00:59:09,591 --> 00:59:10,591
Run for your life!

1038
00:59:33,448 --> 00:59:36,118
That was so beautiful.

1039
00:59:39,288 --> 00:59:40,708
You have earned...

1040
00:59:40,747 --> 00:59:43,457
The right to be judged.

1041
00:59:44,334 --> 00:59:45,504
But be warned.

1042
00:59:45,544 --> 00:59:48,554
No mortal has ever passed.

1043
00:59:50,465 --> 00:59:52,925
For Maria.

1044
00:59:54,428 --> 00:59:55,758
Manolo!

1045
01:00:00,517 --> 01:00:02,937
Manolo Sanchez...

1046
01:00:02,978 --> 01:00:07,228
Your heart is pure and courageous.

1047
01:00:07,274 --> 01:00:09,734
You and yours may enter.

1048
01:00:11,153 --> 01:00:12,783
Don't do that again!

1049
01:00:17,618 --> 01:00:19,658
This is the cave of souls?

1050
01:00:20,037 --> 01:00:22,497
Grandpa! Show some respect.

1051
01:00:22,789 --> 01:00:23,789
That...

1052
01:00:24,124 --> 01:00:25,124
Was...

1053
01:00:25,542 --> 01:00:26,842
Awesome, man!

1054
01:00:26,877 --> 01:00:28,497
Look, the giant boulders were like...

1055
01:00:28,545 --> 01:00:31,005
"Boom, boom, boom!"
And then, you were, like...

1056
01:00:32,341 --> 01:00:34,761
And then, the cave guardian
came in, and he was like...

1057
01:00:34,801 --> 01:00:37,351
"I'm going to judge you
with this giant sword."

1058
01:00:37,387 --> 01:00:39,307
Excuse me? Sir!

1059
01:00:39,348 --> 01:00:41,848
And then, you...

1060
01:00:41,892 --> 01:00:43,312
You got through.

1061
01:00:43,352 --> 01:00:45,442
I have to find LA muerte.

1062
01:00:45,854 --> 01:00:47,114
LA muerte?

1063
01:00:48,398 --> 01:00:49,858
Sorry, you missed her, Manolo.

1064
01:00:49,900 --> 01:00:51,400
Wait! You know me?

1065
01:00:51,735 --> 01:00:54,195
Yeah, man. We know everybody.

1066
01:00:54,238 --> 01:00:57,528
We know Luis, Carmen, and puddle.

1067
01:00:57,574 --> 01:00:58,954
How are you doing, puddle?

1068
01:01:00,327 --> 01:01:01,787
Hello, puddle.

1069
01:01:02,454 --> 01:01:05,424
It's all here in the book of life.

1070
01:01:05,457 --> 01:01:07,627
Wait, where are my manners?

1071
01:01:07,668 --> 01:01:09,338
Come on in, y'all!

1072
01:01:09,837 --> 01:01:13,257
Manolo and his family were the first
to ever see the magic waterfalls...

1073
01:01:13,298 --> 01:01:15,758
That linked all the realms.

1074
01:01:15,801 --> 01:01:19,931
Welcome to the cave of souls!

1075
01:01:23,225 --> 01:01:25,395
Now, this is a cave!

1076
01:01:25,435 --> 01:01:27,345
You see all these candles?

1077
01:01:27,396 --> 01:01:29,976
Each one is a life.

1078
01:01:30,023 --> 01:01:33,903
And I'm your humble,
yet strikingly handsome...

1079
01:01:33,944 --> 01:01:36,244
Candle maker!

1080
01:01:40,909 --> 01:01:42,039
I don't get it.

1081
01:01:42,077 --> 01:01:44,327
Wait! I didn't do the thing.
I got to do the thing.

1082
01:01:44,580 --> 01:01:45,750
Watch this.

1083
01:01:54,506 --> 01:01:55,166
Wow!

1084
01:01:55,465 --> 01:01:57,175
Amazing, huh?

1085
01:01:57,217 --> 01:01:58,887
This is our work!

1086
01:01:58,927 --> 01:02:00,847
This is what we do!

1087
01:02:01,972 --> 01:02:05,102
Look! That group, that's your town.

1088
01:02:05,142 --> 01:02:08,232
And there, that's Maria.

1089
01:02:08,270 --> 01:02:10,020
And next to her, Manolo.

1090
01:02:10,397 --> 01:02:14,227
One aflame with life, the other...

1091
01:02:15,110 --> 01:02:16,110
Kaput.

1092
01:02:16,612 --> 01:02:17,362
You see...

1093
01:02:17,404 --> 01:02:19,494
As long as someone alive
remembers you...

1094
01:02:19,531 --> 01:02:23,951
You get to live in
the land of the remembered.

1095
01:02:24,703 --> 01:02:26,623
- Santa gordita!
- What is it?

1096
01:02:26,663 --> 01:02:28,873
Chakal is on the march.

1097
01:02:29,499 --> 01:02:31,959
With him comes the end of your town.

1098
01:02:32,002 --> 01:02:35,382
And there will be no one left
to remember you.

1099
01:02:35,422 --> 01:02:36,972
We would all be forgotten.

1100
01:02:37,007 --> 01:02:38,967
Please, candle maker.

1101
01:02:39,009 --> 01:02:40,639
Come on, help me go back.

1102
01:02:40,677 --> 01:02:42,547
I can't do that, Manolo.

1103
01:02:45,933 --> 01:02:47,353
Santa chihuahua!

1104
01:02:47,392 --> 01:02:48,642
Okay, okay.

1105
01:02:48,685 --> 01:02:52,555
Look, guys, the book of life
holds everyone's story.

1106
01:02:52,606 --> 01:02:54,856
But the pages on Manolo's life...

1107
01:02:55,609 --> 01:02:56,689
They're blank!

1108
01:02:58,195 --> 01:03:01,665
You didn't live the life
that was written for you.

1109
01:03:01,698 --> 01:03:05,408
You are writing your own story!

1110
01:03:08,539 --> 01:03:09,659
That's good?

1111
01:03:09,706 --> 01:03:11,916
So this means
you'll help me find LA muerte?

1112
01:03:12,960 --> 01:03:18,010
Well, I'm not supposed to interfere,
but I may be able to bend the rules.

1113
01:03:18,048 --> 01:03:20,008
Just a little.

1114
01:03:20,050 --> 01:03:23,090
After all, it is the day of the dead.

1115
01:03:23,136 --> 01:03:24,216
Right, book?

1116
01:03:28,392 --> 01:03:29,772
Come on, let's do this.

1117
01:03:29,810 --> 01:03:31,060
I'll take you to LA muerte.

1118
01:03:31,478 --> 01:03:33,608
- I'm going alone.
- Alone?

1119
01:03:33,647 --> 01:03:34,647
- Hold on, now.
- Fine.

1120
01:03:34,940 --> 01:03:36,360
I'm going alone, too...

1121
01:03:36,400 --> 01:03:37,230
Can I get a word in?

1122
01:03:37,276 --> 01:03:38,686
...right next to you.

1123
01:03:38,735 --> 01:03:40,025
- Actually...
- we should go.

1124
01:03:40,070 --> 01:03:43,740
"We"? No!
It's much too dangerous for a lady!

1125
01:03:43,782 --> 01:03:45,122
- No retreat!
- Hold on!

1126
01:03:45,158 --> 01:03:47,118
No surrender!

1127
01:03:48,287 --> 01:03:50,407
I tried to warn them.

1128
01:03:53,500 --> 01:03:56,420
I immediately regret this decision!

1129
01:04:03,510 --> 01:04:05,850
Are you sure we're in the right place?

1130
01:04:07,764 --> 01:04:11,604
You sanchezes need to look before
you go jumping into magic waterfalls.

1131
01:04:12,019 --> 01:04:13,899
What if you jump into the wrong one?

1132
01:04:13,937 --> 01:04:15,897
You might end up in Tijuana.

1133
01:04:15,939 --> 01:04:17,729
I think I died there.

1134
01:04:17,774 --> 01:04:21,654
Welcome to the land of the forgotten.

1135
01:04:21,695 --> 01:04:22,855
Sad, huh?

1136
01:04:25,532 --> 01:04:26,832
You poor things.

1137
01:04:26,867 --> 01:04:29,287
And that's gonna happen to us
if we don't hurry.

1138
01:04:29,786 --> 01:04:30,786
Come on.

1139
01:04:33,790 --> 01:04:37,460
There it is, xibalba's castle.

1140
01:04:40,506 --> 01:04:41,916
LA muerte!

1141
01:04:41,965 --> 01:04:43,795
I need a word with you, my lady!

1142
01:04:43,842 --> 01:04:45,592
Manolo?

1143
01:04:45,636 --> 01:04:47,256
But how did you get here?

1144
01:04:47,304 --> 01:04:48,684
I had some help.

1145
01:04:49,556 --> 01:04:50,466
Hey, there.

1146
01:04:50,516 --> 01:04:52,766
Candle maker. Carmen!

1147
01:04:52,809 --> 01:04:55,309
And the head of Luis?

1148
01:04:58,857 --> 01:05:01,397
Great, my arthritis is back.

1149
01:05:01,652 --> 01:05:03,492
I know about the wager.

1150
01:05:03,529 --> 01:05:04,779
Xibalba cheated.

1151
01:05:04,821 --> 01:05:06,491
- He did what?
- Yeah!

1152
01:05:06,990 --> 01:05:08,990
With a two-headed snake!

1153
01:05:10,410 --> 01:05:12,290
You might want
to cover your ears right now.

1154
01:05:12,329 --> 01:05:16,499
Xibalba!

1155
01:05:19,586 --> 01:05:21,376
Yes, my dear?

1156
01:05:22,548 --> 01:05:25,548
You misbegotten son of a leprous donkey!

1157
01:05:25,592 --> 01:05:27,302
You cheated!

1158
01:05:27,344 --> 01:05:28,474
Again!

1159
01:05:28,512 --> 01:05:30,102
I did no such thing.

1160
01:05:31,682 --> 01:05:33,812
Oh, that.

1161
01:05:33,851 --> 01:05:36,521
It has a mind of its own. Or two.

1162
01:05:36,562 --> 01:05:38,902
- That is unforgivable!
- Oh, please!

1163
01:05:38,939 --> 01:05:43,069
I never sent that snake to Maria,
and I never gave that medal to joaquin!

1164
01:05:43,110 --> 01:05:45,150
What medal?

1165
01:05:45,195 --> 01:05:47,315
The one I never gave him.

1166
01:05:47,364 --> 01:05:48,574
Ever. At all. Never.

1167
01:05:48,615 --> 01:05:49,985
Who is this joaquin?

1168
01:05:50,033 --> 01:05:53,333
You gave joaquin the medal
of everlasting life?

1169
01:05:53,370 --> 01:05:54,160
Yes.

1170
01:05:54,204 --> 01:05:57,174
"Medal of everlasting life"?

1171
01:05:57,207 --> 01:05:59,127
Whoever wears the medal
cannot die or be injured.

1172
01:06:02,212 --> 01:06:03,882
Please, can you help me up?

1173
01:06:07,885 --> 01:06:09,595
Thank you.

1174
01:06:09,636 --> 01:06:11,346
Can I get a slap, too?

1175
01:06:11,388 --> 01:06:12,558
My son did not deserve this.

1176
01:06:12,598 --> 01:06:14,638
Come on, I have to go back.

1177
01:06:16,101 --> 01:06:17,601
It's only fair.

1178
01:06:20,397 --> 01:06:22,897
Please, balby?

1179
01:06:22,941 --> 01:06:24,031
"Balby"?

1180
01:06:24,067 --> 01:06:25,067
No. Never.

1181
01:06:25,068 --> 01:06:27,028
- You better do this!
- No.

1182
01:06:27,070 --> 01:06:28,950
Hey, what about a wager?

1183
01:06:28,989 --> 01:06:30,659
- A wager?
- If I win...

1184
01:06:31,033 --> 01:06:33,033
You give me my life back.

1185
01:06:33,076 --> 01:06:34,406
You have nothing I want.

1186
01:06:34,453 --> 01:06:35,753
But I do.

1187
01:06:35,787 --> 01:06:39,417
If you win, xibalba,
you can rule both realms.

1188
01:06:39,458 --> 01:06:42,998
You name the task, anything you want,
and I will beat you.

1189
01:06:44,129 --> 01:06:46,419
What? Are you afraid you might lose?

1190
01:06:46,798 --> 01:06:48,218
What you doing, kid?

1191
01:06:50,344 --> 01:06:51,764
Do we have a deal?

1192
01:06:52,221 --> 01:06:54,511
We have a deal.

1193
01:06:54,556 --> 01:06:57,426
Now, tell me, boy,
what keeps you up at night?

1194
01:06:57,809 --> 01:07:00,099
What eats at you from the inside?

1195
01:07:00,145 --> 01:07:03,395
What, do tell, is your worst fear?

1196
01:07:05,859 --> 01:07:06,859
Got it.

1197
01:07:15,953 --> 01:07:17,503
Manolo Sanchez!

1198
01:07:17,538 --> 01:07:20,078
You will have to defeat every bull...

1199
01:07:20,123 --> 01:07:22,213
The Sanchez family ever finished!

1200
01:07:23,168 --> 01:07:25,298
That would be thousands!

1201
01:07:25,337 --> 01:07:26,377
All...

1202
01:07:26,421 --> 01:07:27,511
At...

1203
01:07:27,548 --> 01:07:28,878
Once!

1204
01:07:29,383 --> 01:07:31,093
If you complete this task...

1205
01:07:31,552 --> 01:07:33,642
You will live again.

1206
01:07:33,679 --> 01:07:37,269
And if you fail, you will be forgotten.

1207
01:07:37,307 --> 01:07:38,307
Forever.

1208
01:07:38,308 --> 01:07:40,228
This is impossible. It can't be done!

1209
01:07:48,318 --> 01:07:49,318
You can do it!

1210
01:07:54,575 --> 01:07:55,785
Are you two all right?

1211
01:07:55,826 --> 01:07:58,746
Chakal is coming!
With a whole army behind him!

1212
01:07:58,787 --> 01:08:01,037
You boys warn general posada.

1213
01:08:01,290 --> 01:08:03,580
I will buy you some time.

1214
01:08:05,127 --> 01:08:07,247
Who wants to go first?

1215
01:08:13,093 --> 01:08:14,843
I hate...

1216
01:08:14,887 --> 01:08:16,387
Bullfighters.

1217
01:08:16,430 --> 01:08:18,220
Then come and get some.

1218
01:08:26,815 --> 01:08:27,685
Manolo!

1219
01:08:27,733 --> 01:08:28,783
Get out of there!

1220
01:08:32,362 --> 01:08:33,702
What is happening?

1221
01:08:33,739 --> 01:08:35,199
- Carlos!
- Carmen!

1222
01:08:35,240 --> 01:08:37,330
Manolo! Your father is here!

1223
01:08:38,202 --> 01:08:39,082
Papa?

1224
01:08:39,119 --> 01:08:41,869
Chakal and his men
are at the gates of San angel!

1225
01:09:05,395 --> 01:09:07,555
Man, this is a whole lot of bull.

1226
01:09:10,067 --> 01:09:12,187
Maria posada...

1227
01:09:12,236 --> 01:09:15,606
Do you take joaquin to be your husband?

1228
01:09:15,656 --> 01:09:16,866
Yes.

1229
01:09:16,907 --> 01:09:18,447
For San angel, I do.

1230
01:09:18,492 --> 01:09:20,082
And joaquin...

1231
01:09:20,118 --> 01:09:22,498
Do you take Maria to be your wife?

1232
01:09:24,414 --> 01:09:25,464
I...

1233
01:09:28,001 --> 01:09:29,791
Chakal is here!

1234
01:09:30,462 --> 01:09:33,172
My medal. It's on my other suit.

1235
01:09:33,215 --> 01:09:34,425
I gotta go.

1236
01:09:34,466 --> 01:09:37,716
But joaquin is the only one
who can defeat chakal.

1237
01:09:43,725 --> 01:09:45,185
We can fight them together, papa.

1238
01:09:55,779 --> 01:09:57,909
Get up and fight like a Sanchez!

1239
01:09:58,782 --> 01:10:01,162
Mama? What are you doing here?

1240
01:10:01,994 --> 01:10:03,204
Cholesterol.

1241
01:10:08,458 --> 01:10:09,458
Everyone!

1242
01:10:10,002 --> 01:10:11,422
Listen up!

1243
01:10:13,463 --> 01:10:17,013
I know you're scared,
but look around you.

1244
01:10:17,050 --> 01:10:19,180
- Do you know what I see?
- No.

1245
01:10:19,219 --> 01:10:22,759
I see proud people
ready to fight for their beloved town.

1246
01:10:22,806 --> 01:10:27,686
And I see that inside each of you
is a strength that cannot be measured.

1247
01:10:28,187 --> 01:10:29,397
Yes...

1248
01:10:29,438 --> 01:10:30,938
Even in you, pepe.

1249
01:10:32,774 --> 01:10:35,074
This day of the dead
will never be forgotten!

1250
01:10:35,110 --> 01:10:37,530
We will teach chakal...

1251
01:10:37,571 --> 01:10:39,611
That he's messing with the wrong town.

1252
01:10:40,616 --> 01:10:41,736
San angel...

1253
01:10:41,783 --> 01:10:46,583
I swear by those before us,
we will not fall!

1254
01:10:46,622 --> 01:10:47,622
Not today.

1255
01:10:48,332 --> 01:10:49,582
Medal!

1256
01:10:49,625 --> 01:10:51,005
Not ever!

1257
01:10:51,043 --> 01:10:52,923
Now, who's with me?

1258
01:10:54,421 --> 01:10:57,301
You are like the son I never had!

1259
01:10:57,341 --> 01:10:58,721
But much prettier!

1260
01:11:04,932 --> 01:11:08,392
Hey, chakal! Why don't you pick
on someone your own size?

1261
01:11:08,435 --> 01:11:10,765
Because no one's that big, man.

1262
01:11:11,772 --> 01:11:13,152
Where have you been?

1263
01:11:13,190 --> 01:11:14,320
Thank goodness you're...

1264
01:11:14,358 --> 01:11:16,188
hey! Soldier boy.

1265
01:11:17,444 --> 01:11:19,404
You give me that medal.

1266
01:11:19,446 --> 01:11:21,446
Right now!

1267
01:11:22,699 --> 01:11:25,409
All this is about a stupid medal?

1268
01:11:25,452 --> 01:11:26,582
Are you kidding me?

1269
01:11:26,620 --> 01:11:29,870
Not now, Maria. It's joaquin time.

1270
01:11:29,915 --> 01:11:31,335
Joaquin!

1271
01:11:34,753 --> 01:11:35,753
Joaquin!

1272
01:11:41,301 --> 01:11:43,721
Hey, buddy, let's talk about this.

1273
01:11:46,765 --> 01:11:47,965
Joaquin!

1274
01:11:49,643 --> 01:11:50,983
Joaquin?

1275
01:12:11,456 --> 01:12:13,116
The beast is out!

1276
01:12:13,167 --> 01:12:15,337
Time to finish this.

1277
01:12:25,470 --> 01:12:27,060
Yeah!

1278
01:12:27,097 --> 01:12:28,967
Finish him! Finish him!

1279
01:12:37,608 --> 01:12:39,648
What is he doing?

1280
01:13:19,274 --> 01:13:21,574
Toro, I am humbled

1281
01:13:21,902 --> 01:13:24,072
for tonight, I understand

1282
01:13:24,112 --> 01:13:28,202
your royal blood was never meant
to decorate this sand

1283
01:13:29,243 --> 01:13:33,583
you've suffered great injustice
so have thousands before you

1284
01:13:34,498 --> 01:13:36,538
I offer an apology

1285
01:13:36,792 --> 01:13:38,882
and one long overdue

1286
01:13:42,005 --> 01:13:45,085
I am sorry

1287
01:13:45,133 --> 01:13:47,183
toro, I am sorry

1288
01:13:48,095 --> 01:13:49,355
hear my song

1289
01:13:49,680 --> 01:13:51,770
and know I sing the truth

1290
01:13:53,183 --> 01:13:56,143
although we were bred to fight

1291
01:13:58,021 --> 01:14:02,611
I reach for kindness in your heart tonight

1292
01:14:03,151 --> 01:14:05,901
and if you can forgive

1293
01:14:06,321 --> 01:14:09,121
and if you can forgive

1294
01:14:09,157 --> 01:14:13,577
love can truly live

1295
01:14:13,620 --> 01:14:15,910
and if you can forgive

1296
01:14:15,956 --> 01:14:18,876
and if you can forgive

1297
01:14:19,334 --> 01:14:23,214
love can truly live

1298
01:14:33,891 --> 01:14:36,021
and if you can forgive

1299
01:14:36,476 --> 01:14:39,016
and if you can forgive

1300
01:14:39,813 --> 01:14:40,813
love

1301
01:14:42,691 --> 01:14:46,571
love will truly live

1302
01:14:50,908 --> 01:14:53,578
- he did it!
- Yes, he did.

1303
01:14:53,619 --> 01:14:55,789
Yeah. I'll give him that.

1304
01:14:56,455 --> 01:14:58,795
But how did Manolo do this?

1305
01:14:58,832 --> 01:14:59,922
He's a Sanchez.

1306
01:15:02,085 --> 01:15:03,335
Xibalba had been wrong.

1307
01:15:03,629 --> 01:15:05,959
Manolo's fear was never bullfighting.

1308
01:15:06,006 --> 01:15:09,086
I told you,
a Sanchez man never apologizes.

1309
01:15:09,134 --> 01:15:10,134
Papa, I...

1310
01:15:10,344 --> 01:15:13,224
but you just changed that.

1311
01:15:13,263 --> 01:15:15,813
I should have been a better father.

1312
01:15:15,849 --> 01:15:17,269
I am very sorry.

1313
01:15:17,976 --> 01:15:19,056
No.

1314
01:15:19,102 --> 01:15:21,192
You only wanted what was best for me.

1315
01:15:21,939 --> 01:15:23,819
I'm so proud of you, son.

1316
01:15:25,108 --> 01:15:26,778
I love you, papa.

1317
01:15:28,278 --> 01:15:32,448
And at that moment,
Manolo conquered his greatest fear...

1318
01:15:32,491 --> 01:15:34,451
Being himself.

1319
01:15:34,785 --> 01:15:38,045
In accordance with the ancient rules...

1320
01:15:38,539 --> 01:15:42,079
We give you life.

1321
01:15:42,125 --> 01:15:44,035
Be careful up there, mijo.

1322
01:15:54,221 --> 01:15:55,221
Please, chakal...

1323
01:15:55,514 --> 01:15:56,774
Just don't hurt them.

1324
01:15:56,807 --> 01:15:57,807
Yes.

1325
01:15:57,850 --> 01:15:58,770
Yes!

1326
01:15:58,809 --> 01:16:01,849
The medal is mine!

1327
01:16:19,246 --> 01:16:20,496
What?

1328
01:16:22,875 --> 01:16:24,175
Manolo?

1329
01:16:36,555 --> 01:16:38,185
Hold this for me, amigo.

1330
01:16:41,476 --> 01:16:44,936
So, my father tells me
you hate bullfighters.

1331
01:16:44,980 --> 01:16:47,190
I hate everybody.

1332
01:16:48,817 --> 01:16:50,317
Yeah. Yeah, mang.

1333
01:16:50,360 --> 01:16:52,030
Okay. Let's do this.

1334
01:16:53,363 --> 01:16:55,663
You and what army?

1335
01:17:10,047 --> 01:17:11,877
It's the day of the dead, Manolo.

1336
01:17:12,216 --> 01:17:16,046
And on our day,
we have a certain amount of...

1337
01:17:16,094 --> 01:17:17,394
Leeway.

1338
01:17:17,429 --> 01:17:18,349
Good luck!

1339
01:17:18,388 --> 01:17:20,058
Thank you!

1340
01:17:23,435 --> 01:17:24,555
No retreat.

1341
01:17:24,603 --> 01:17:25,733
No surrender!

1342
01:17:25,771 --> 01:17:28,731
He gonna do it now!

1343
01:18:02,766 --> 01:18:04,636
We should get that guy for the band.

1344
01:18:06,436 --> 01:18:07,896
Now, is your turn!

1345
01:18:07,938 --> 01:18:10,068
Okay, I sing good, too.

1346
01:18:13,819 --> 01:18:16,779
I was like,
"I think you look good. I like your hair."

1347
01:18:16,822 --> 01:18:18,282
And he was like, "I like your hair."

1348
01:18:18,740 --> 01:18:20,080
Are you wearing my boots?

1349
01:18:20,117 --> 01:18:21,737
They look better on me.

1350
01:18:21,785 --> 01:18:22,985
Come here, lover boy!

1351
01:18:34,298 --> 01:18:35,468
Medal!

1352
01:18:38,719 --> 01:18:40,639
Thank you

1353
01:18:51,607 --> 01:18:52,607
hold me!

1354
01:18:54,610 --> 01:18:55,530
Chakal!

1355
01:18:55,569 --> 01:18:56,899
We found the medal!

1356
01:18:57,529 --> 01:18:59,699
My comrades.

1357
01:18:59,948 --> 01:19:01,408
Unleash the fury!

1358
01:19:01,450 --> 01:19:02,450
?????

1359
01:19:06,622 --> 01:19:08,082
I'm done playing!

1360
01:19:08,123 --> 01:19:09,963
I got it. I got this.

1361
01:19:10,000 --> 01:19:12,250
No, no, no! I got this!

1362
01:19:15,005 --> 01:19:17,255
Did I tell you I also studied kung fu?

1363
01:19:17,299 --> 01:19:18,469
- Enough!
- Look out!

1364
01:19:23,514 --> 01:19:24,644
Let go of me!

1365
01:19:24,681 --> 01:19:27,891
Get me my medal, or your woman will pay!

1366
01:19:27,935 --> 01:19:29,645
Men. Typical!

1367
01:19:30,437 --> 01:19:31,727
Go find the medal.

1368
01:19:31,772 --> 01:19:32,772
But Maria...

1369
01:19:32,814 --> 01:19:34,824
Find the medal.

1370
01:19:34,858 --> 01:19:35,978
I'll handle this.

1371
01:19:37,528 --> 01:19:38,948
Got it. Joaquin!

1372
01:19:55,295 --> 01:19:57,205
I save you, little Sanchez!

1373
01:19:59,633 --> 01:20:00,633
Good luck, Manolo!

1374
01:20:01,385 --> 01:20:03,475
Kick his butt, grandson.

1375
01:20:06,890 --> 01:20:07,810
Where do you think you're going?

1376
01:20:08,058 --> 01:20:09,678
I have to get up there!

1377
01:20:09,726 --> 01:20:11,266
I was right!

1378
01:20:11,311 --> 01:20:14,361
You have become
the greatest Sanchez ever!

1379
01:20:34,209 --> 01:20:35,959
Care to dance, señorita?

1380
01:20:36,003 --> 01:20:37,383
I thought you'd never ask.

1381
01:20:54,897 --> 01:20:56,517
Pretty good, guitarrista.

1382
01:20:56,565 --> 01:20:58,445
Now it's your turn!

1383
01:21:02,529 --> 01:21:03,529
Watch out, sisters!

1384
01:21:03,739 --> 01:21:05,119
Save yourselves!

1385
01:21:10,370 --> 01:21:12,160
Hi, Maria!

1386
01:21:12,206 --> 01:21:13,246
Hi!

1387
01:21:22,633 --> 01:21:26,143
I'm taking this whole town with me!

1388
01:21:32,643 --> 01:21:34,603
No more shadows, dad.

1389
01:21:34,645 --> 01:21:36,065
No retreat?

1390
01:21:36,897 --> 01:21:38,227
No surrender.

1391
01:21:44,488 --> 01:21:46,658
- Manolo, the column!
- I got it.

1392
01:21:47,115 --> 01:21:48,945
No. No!

1393
01:21:48,992 --> 01:21:49,992
Hey!

1394
01:21:51,578 --> 01:21:53,288
Don't stop fighting for what's right.

1395
01:21:53,330 --> 01:21:54,500
Wait, what?

1396
01:21:55,749 --> 01:21:56,749
Manolo!

1397
01:21:57,125 --> 01:21:58,495
Adios, brother.

1398
01:21:58,961 --> 01:22:00,341
What is he doing?

1399
01:22:07,177 --> 01:22:08,677
Don't forget me.

1400
01:22:10,180 --> 01:22:11,180
No!

1401
01:22:19,857 --> 01:22:21,817
Chakal is defeated!

1402
01:22:21,859 --> 01:22:23,319
Retreat!

1403
01:22:37,124 --> 01:22:38,124
Manolo?

1404
01:22:43,547 --> 01:22:45,337
It's me, mi Amor.

1405
01:22:46,008 --> 01:22:49,088
But how did you survive?

1406
01:22:49,136 --> 01:22:51,046
Don't look at me.

1407
01:22:53,724 --> 01:22:54,854
Joaquin.

1408
01:22:55,475 --> 01:22:57,765
You gave me the medal.

1409
01:22:57,811 --> 01:23:00,481
You were going to sacrifice yourself...

1410
01:23:00,522 --> 01:23:01,732
For me.

1411
01:23:02,733 --> 01:23:05,113
I thought it might be time...

1412
01:23:05,152 --> 01:23:08,072
To be a true hero.
Like you, Manolo.

1413
01:23:08,530 --> 01:23:09,910
Are you all right?

1414
01:23:13,493 --> 01:23:16,163
I have never seen more clearly.

1415
01:23:20,083 --> 01:23:22,093
It's time to cast our own shadows.

1416
01:23:22,669 --> 01:23:25,419
And write our own stories.

1417
01:23:26,006 --> 01:23:30,136
And so, joaquin learned
that to be a true hero...

1418
01:23:30,177 --> 01:23:32,257
You have to be selfless.

1419
01:23:35,557 --> 01:23:38,227
There is one more thing we need to do...

1420
01:23:38,936 --> 01:23:40,436
Son.

1421
01:23:41,605 --> 01:23:44,655
Do you take Manolo as your husband?

1422
01:23:44,691 --> 01:23:45,691
I do.

1423
01:23:46,193 --> 01:23:49,993
By the power vested in us
by the book of life...

1424
01:23:50,030 --> 01:23:53,490
We now pronounce you husband and wife.

1425
01:23:53,534 --> 01:23:54,534
You may kiss...

1426
01:23:55,452 --> 01:23:56,912
The groom?

1427
01:23:57,538 --> 01:24:00,118
She is gonna be a great Sanchez.

1428
01:24:01,792 --> 01:24:04,252
And today was a good day...

1429
01:24:04,294 --> 01:24:05,634
Of the dead.

1430
01:24:06,797 --> 01:24:08,167
Well...

1431
01:24:08,215 --> 01:24:10,435
I believe you've won the wager, mi Amor.

1432
01:24:10,467 --> 01:24:13,927
Along with my heart, all over again.

1433
01:24:13,971 --> 01:24:15,811
Balby.

1434
01:24:16,265 --> 01:24:18,525
I'm so sorry, my love.

1435
01:24:18,559 --> 01:24:21,689
You deserve better than me.
I know that now.

1436
01:24:21,728 --> 01:24:23,768
Will you ever forgive me?

1437
01:24:24,231 --> 01:24:25,481
I do.

1438
01:24:30,821 --> 01:24:33,911
Husband, how about a song?

1439
01:24:33,949 --> 01:24:36,829
As you wish, Mrs. Sanchez.

1440
01:24:37,327 --> 01:24:40,957
I will stay by you...

1441
01:24:40,998 --> 01:24:42,668
Even when we fall

1442
01:24:44,668 --> 01:24:48,088
I will be the rock that holds you up
and lifts you high...

1443
01:24:48,130 --> 01:24:50,010
So you stand tall

1444
01:24:52,593 --> 01:24:54,643
and I won't let you fall

1445
01:24:56,513 --> 01:24:58,473
I won't let you...

1446
01:24:58,515 --> 01:25:00,095
Go

1447
01:25:01,727 --> 01:25:04,767
no matter where you are
no matter where you are

1448
01:25:04,813 --> 01:25:06,693
I'll be there

1449
01:25:09,026 --> 01:25:12,146
no matter where you are
no matter where you are

1450
01:25:12,196 --> 01:25:14,026
I'll be there

1451
01:25:16,700 --> 01:25:21,500
so tear apart these giant hearts
that beat inside us now

1452
01:25:23,373 --> 01:25:27,543
let's give ourselves our promises
of our unending...

1453
01:25:28,253 --> 01:25:30,553
Love

1454
01:25:32,716 --> 01:25:34,676
and I won't let you fall

1455
01:25:34,718 --> 01:25:36,638
I won't let you fall

1456
01:25:36,678 --> 01:25:38,848
I won't let you go

1457
01:25:38,889 --> 01:25:41,059
I won't let you go

1458
01:25:41,767 --> 01:25:44,847
no matter where you are
no matter where you are

1459
01:25:44,895 --> 01:25:46,655
I'll be there

1460
01:25:46,688 --> 01:25:48,978
I will be there

1461
01:25:49,024 --> 01:25:50,824
no matter where you are

1462
01:25:50,859 --> 01:25:52,239
no matter where you are

1463
01:25:52,277 --> 01:25:53,737
I'll be there

1464
01:25:53,779 --> 01:25:56,359
I will be there

1465
01:25:56,406 --> 01:25:59,406
no matter where you are
no matter where you are

1466
01:25:59,451 --> 01:26:01,541
I'll be there

1467
01:26:06,792 --> 01:26:08,882
I'll be there

1468
01:26:10,921 --> 01:26:12,841
and the world keeps spinning...

1469
01:26:12,881 --> 01:26:14,921
And the tales keep turning...

1470
01:26:14,967 --> 01:26:17,717
And people come,
and people go...

1471
01:26:17,761 --> 01:26:19,721
But they are never forgotten.

1472
01:26:19,763 --> 01:26:23,563
And the one truth we know,
it held true one more time...

1473
01:26:23,600 --> 01:26:26,230
That love, true love...

1474
01:26:26,270 --> 01:26:29,270
The really, really good kind of love...

1475
01:26:29,898 --> 01:26:31,518
Never dies.

1476
01:26:31,567 --> 01:26:34,237
Caramba, it gets me every time.

1477
01:26:34,278 --> 01:26:36,278
Okay, kids, closing time.

1478
01:26:37,614 --> 01:26:39,294
Your bus should be outside
waiting for you.

1479
01:26:41,618 --> 01:26:43,448
Adios, pretty lady!

1480
01:26:44,288 --> 01:26:46,078
Adios, Sasha!

1481
01:26:46,123 --> 01:26:47,793
LA muerte?

1482
01:26:49,001 --> 01:26:50,631
LA muerte!

1483
01:26:51,962 --> 01:26:53,592
You never cease to amaze me...

1484
01:26:53,630 --> 01:26:55,090
Mi Amor. Such passion.

1485
01:26:55,132 --> 01:26:56,632
Anyone can die.

1486
01:26:56,675 --> 01:27:00,255
These kids,
they will have the courage to live.

1487
01:27:00,304 --> 01:27:02,934
I'll wager you are right, my love.

1488
01:27:08,604 --> 01:27:11,694
Hey, write your own story.
