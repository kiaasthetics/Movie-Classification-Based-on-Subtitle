1
00:01:38,756 --> 00:01:44,756
Okay, time to eat.
Let's see... Open the app.

2
00:01:46,180 --> 00:01:49,182
I'm gonna get a double
pepperoni pizza,

3
00:01:49,183 --> 00:01:51,852
order of breadsticks,

4
00:01:51,853 --> 00:01:55,606
and, well, lasagna, yeah.

5
00:01:55,607 --> 00:01:59,944
New item alert? Jalapeño
breadstick quick bites.

6
00:02:00,737 --> 00:02:02,905
It might be nice to have
something in the salad family.

7
00:02:02,906 --> 00:02:05,074
And do I want dessert?

8
00:02:06,367 --> 00:02:09,913
I'm gonna be naughty,
butterscotch budino.

9
00:02:10,078 --> 00:02:11,706
Okay, I'm gonna have five.

10
00:02:13,249 --> 00:02:14,250
Delivery?

11
00:02:15,335 --> 00:02:17,837
Goes without saying.
Now, please.

12
00:02:19,005 --> 00:02:21,840
All right, that ought to
hold me 'til breakfast.

13
00:02:21,841 --> 00:02:24,593
Hey! Wait, are you guys
early or am I late?

14
00:02:24,594 --> 00:02:28,431
No matter. I have got a
real treat for you today.

15
00:02:29,766 --> 00:02:31,309
No, not a treat for you.

16
00:02:34,437 --> 00:02:35,438
Okay.

17
00:02:37,690 --> 00:02:39,484
Anyway, about that treat.

18
00:02:40,151 --> 00:02:43,028
Can I just say, you will
not be disappointed?

19
00:02:43,029 --> 00:02:47,366
It's a story about me that
no one's ever heard before,

20
00:02:47,367 --> 00:02:50,078
featuring someone in my
life you've never met.

21
00:02:50,662 --> 00:02:54,207
I don't know about you,
but color me intrigued.

22
00:02:57,418 --> 00:02:59,003
Yeah, drone delivery.

23
00:02:59,504 --> 00:03:00,713
Welcome to the future.

24
00:03:01,589 --> 00:03:03,173
You know, to really
understand everything,

25
00:03:03,174 --> 00:03:05,718
I'm gonna have to take you
back to where it all began.

26
00:03:07,303 --> 00:03:09,783
Don't want anything to take away
from the flavor of the cheese.

27
00:03:15,687 --> 00:03:18,314
And like every great
story, it all started...

28
00:03:23,653 --> 00:03:26,447
on a dark and stormy night.

29
00:03:32,871 --> 00:03:36,916
Wait here, Junior.
I'll be right back.

30
00:05:20,061 --> 00:05:22,104
Open wide, Jake.

31
00:05:39,247 --> 00:05:42,207
Hi there, little buddy! Hi!

32
00:05:48,170 --> 00:05:50,091
I'm so full.

33
00:05:58,516 --> 00:06:01,180
You hungry, little guy?

34
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:08,817
You want a little more?

35
00:06:08,818 --> 00:06:11,486
You are a hungry little guy.

36
00:06:11,487 --> 00:06:15,949
That was a quick dinner,

37
00:06:15,950 --> 00:06:17,034
Signore Jon.

38
00:06:17,035 --> 00:06:21,164
You must have been very hungry.
Can I bring you anything else?

39
00:06:22,123 --> 00:06:23,499
Yes.

40
00:06:23,791 --> 00:06:25,209
Thank you very much.

41
00:06:25,210 --> 00:06:27,294
Some... lasagna?

42
00:06:27,295 --> 00:06:30,005
- Si, lasagna for one.
- Yeah.

43
00:06:30,006 --> 00:06:31,924
You know what, no.

44
00:06:31,925 --> 00:06:33,592
- Make it family-style.
- Very good.

45
00:06:33,593 --> 00:06:36,386
- To go, please, Vito.
- Okay, everybody!

46
00:06:36,387 --> 00:06:38,972
- What? Where'd he go?
- You all know this one!

47
00:06:38,973 --> 00:06:40,098
Hey!

48
00:06:40,099 --> 00:06:42,768
Stand up and sing.
Join with us!

49
00:06:42,769 --> 00:06:47,147
No! Hey! Oh, no, I'm dancing.

50
00:06:47,148 --> 00:06:51,361
Excuse me, pardon me.
I hate this. What? Hey! Oh, no.

51
00:07:04,332 --> 00:07:09,128
Jon! Takeout for Jon!

52
00:07:11,422 --> 00:07:13,257
Your takeout is ready,

53
00:07:13,258 --> 00:07:14,716
- Signore Jon.
- Yes.

54
00:07:14,717 --> 00:07:17,512
One famiglia style
lasagna, to go.

55
00:07:19,013 --> 00:07:21,014
- You eat alone too much, Jon.
- Yeah.

56
00:07:21,015 --> 00:07:22,599
You should get on
the dating apps.

57
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:24,142
- There's Bumble, Tinder...
- I'm good, thanks.

58
00:07:24,143 --> 00:07:25,352
Gluten-Free Singles...

59
00:07:25,353 --> 00:07:27,271
- Hot Sauce Passions.
- No, I could never...

60
00:07:27,272 --> 00:07:29,606
And you should spend serious money
on premium memberships.

61
00:07:29,607 --> 00:07:30,692
Bye!

62
00:07:34,862 --> 00:07:35,863
Hey!

63
00:07:36,447 --> 00:07:38,448
Well, that was an
interesting dinner...

64
00:07:38,449 --> 00:07:39,534
that you had.

65
00:07:41,202 --> 00:07:45,081
Well, I guess... this
is where we say goodbye.

66
00:07:47,834 --> 00:07:49,210
You're really cute

67
00:07:49,711 --> 00:07:52,755
but I can't have pets
in my apartment.

68
00:07:53,423 --> 00:07:59,423
So, I'll see you around.
Okay? Go on.

69
00:08:02,307 --> 00:08:05,393
No. No, don't cry, don't cry.

70
00:08:09,063 --> 00:08:11,733
No, no, no!
No. Oh, no. Oh, no.

71
00:08:12,483 --> 00:08:14,652
Wait. Wait, wait, wait.

72
00:08:20,783 --> 00:08:23,494
You don't have a home, do you?

73
00:08:49,020 --> 00:08:51,356
And that's how I adopted Jon.

74
00:08:59,530 --> 00:09:01,740
So, I moved Jon out
of his apartment...

75
00:09:01,741 --> 00:09:04,911
to this nice little two-bed,
two-bath in the suburbs.

76
00:09:06,412 --> 00:09:08,247
As soon as he understood
the ground rules,

77
00:09:08,248 --> 00:09:11,000
well, let's just say...
we were living the dream.

78
00:09:15,088 --> 00:09:17,840
And once we were settled in,
I even let Jon get a pet.

79
00:09:32,564 --> 00:09:34,731
Odie became my
most trusted ally.

80
00:09:34,732 --> 00:09:36,441
He was kind, gentle...

81
00:09:36,442 --> 00:09:39,946
and most importantly,
my unpaid intern.

82
00:10:00,758 --> 00:10:01,758
Yeah, as you can see,

83
00:10:01,759 --> 00:10:04,345
life here is pretty
near perfect.

84
00:10:05,597 --> 00:10:06,639
Well, yeah, except for...

85
00:10:08,516 --> 00:10:09,684
Time to go to the vet!

86
00:10:12,645 --> 00:10:13,937
We're gonna need the big scale!

87
00:10:13,938 --> 00:10:16,733
Does she need to announce
it to the whole office?

88
00:10:25,950 --> 00:10:28,203
No! Please, no!
It's so hot, it's really hurting!

89
00:10:35,585 --> 00:10:37,921
And that's why we should
go from Sunday to Tuesday.

90
00:10:39,505 --> 00:10:40,715
Okay. Where were we?

91
00:10:43,009 --> 00:10:45,970
Wakey, wakey, eggs and
bakey. Good morning!

92
00:11:09,869 --> 00:11:11,496
What? Where'd you
get that chair?

93
00:11:21,339 --> 00:11:23,048
I think I was meant
to be here tonight

94
00:11:23,049 --> 00:11:24,550
because I was meant to meet you.

95
00:11:24,551 --> 00:11:26,927
- I think we were meant to be.
- That's what I meant to say.

96
00:11:26,928 --> 00:11:28,304
You had me at the word, meant.

97
00:11:34,227 --> 00:11:35,769
We're gonna ride like the wind!

98
00:11:35,770 --> 00:11:38,273
Faster! Harder! More insane!

99
00:11:43,361 --> 00:11:44,361
Odie?

100
00:11:44,362 --> 00:11:45,862
Yeah, can you put
this back to normal?

101
00:11:45,863 --> 00:11:47,281
There you go, just
let the pepperoni's

102
00:11:47,282 --> 00:11:48,741
healing powers work its magic.

103
00:12:13,725 --> 00:12:14,726
You saw nothing.

104
00:12:24,527 --> 00:12:27,864
Up until that moment,
my life was a perfect soufflé.

105
00:12:29,532 --> 00:12:32,493
Little did I know it was
all about to collapse.

106
00:12:35,038 --> 00:12:38,081
Imagine yourself drifting away

107
00:12:38,082 --> 00:12:40,501
on a sea of tranquility.

108
00:12:41,211 --> 00:12:43,754
There are no pets to bother you,

109
00:12:43,755 --> 00:12:47,424
distract you or max
out your credit card

110
00:12:47,425 --> 00:12:51,638
by excessively placing
online food orders.

111
00:12:58,519 --> 00:13:02,649
Yeah... Sorry...
What? Who said that?

112
00:13:03,650 --> 00:13:06,736
Odie, Odie? Odie!

113
00:13:07,528 --> 00:13:09,072
It's time for our
midnight snack.

114
00:13:16,412 --> 00:13:17,621
Thank you, good sir,

115
00:13:17,622 --> 00:13:19,332
your kindness will be rewarded.

116
00:13:26,089 --> 00:13:28,882
What are we feeling
like today? French?

117
00:13:28,883 --> 00:13:34,883
Italian? Chinese?
Cupcakes? Chinese it is.

118
00:13:34,889 --> 00:13:37,558
Odie, shape everything
from the bottom two shelves

119
00:13:37,559 --> 00:13:38,685
into a dumpling.

120
00:14:06,379 --> 00:14:10,091
- Late night snackin'.
- Not good for digestion!

121
00:14:11,593 --> 00:14:14,137
Odie, I'm dreamin' again.
Slap me across the face.

122
00:14:17,682 --> 00:14:19,099
Nope. Still dreamin'.

123
00:14:19,100 --> 00:14:20,643
I must be really
deep in this one.

124
00:14:29,611 --> 00:14:31,320
What do you guys...
You want money?

125
00:14:31,321 --> 00:14:34,448
I don't have any money, okay?
Who carries cash anymore?

126
00:14:34,449 --> 00:14:37,367
I've got Jon's credit card
number memorized...

127
00:14:37,368 --> 00:14:41,330
5-5-5-2-3-8-5-7-5-5-2-1.
Did you write that down?

128
00:14:41,331 --> 00:14:47,253
- Expiration code is 5-5-5.
- The cat is out of the bag!

129
00:14:53,885 --> 00:14:55,636
I really hope this
kidnapping plan works

130
00:14:55,637 --> 00:14:57,305
or she'll put us down...

131
00:14:58,097 --> 00:15:00,642
with her insults and
cutting observations.

132
00:15:01,684 --> 00:15:03,685
I think this is a case
of mistaken identity.

133
00:15:03,686 --> 00:15:05,145
You must be looking for another

134
00:15:05,146 --> 00:15:06,981
gorgeous, lovable
kitty cat, right?

135
00:15:08,107 --> 00:15:10,192
Hey, hey, hey!
Hey, where're you going?

136
00:15:10,193 --> 00:15:11,694
No, no, come back, come back!

137
00:15:17,450 --> 00:15:21,119
Odie? I'll handle this.
All right, you guys.

138
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:23,539
I'm giving you to
the count of three

139
00:15:23,540 --> 00:15:26,708
to get back here
and let us down.

140
00:15:26,709 --> 00:15:29,587
One, two, three!

141
00:15:30,964 --> 00:15:32,839
Four, five...

142
00:15:32,840 --> 00:15:34,175
I am not kidding here!

143
00:15:36,761 --> 00:15:42,141
Three hundred and eight,
309, 300...

144
00:15:43,142 --> 00:15:47,480
Yeah, they're not comin'.
It's over.

145
00:15:53,778 --> 00:15:55,321
Am I dead?

146
00:15:57,782 --> 00:15:59,409
Are you an angel?

147
00:16:05,874 --> 00:16:08,334
Please, take me.

148
00:16:09,210 --> 00:16:10,920
I am ready to go to that...

149
00:16:11,713 --> 00:16:14,007
to that all-you-can-eat
buffet in the sky.

150
00:16:16,467 --> 00:16:19,052
What? Listen,
I'm going to swing you out,

151
00:16:19,053 --> 00:16:21,847
cut your ropes and drop you
safely to that landing below.

152
00:16:21,848 --> 00:16:23,932
Wait, what?
That seems a tad risky.

153
00:16:23,933 --> 00:16:25,392
Is there another plan
that doesn't involve

154
00:16:25,393 --> 00:16:27,185
cutting a rope over
a 40-foot drop?

155
00:16:27,186 --> 00:16:29,731
No time. We gotta get outta
here before they come back.

156
00:16:41,868 --> 00:16:43,578
We need to go.
Come on, Junior!

157
00:16:44,746 --> 00:16:47,373
Wait here, Junior.
I'll be right back.

158
00:16:49,292 --> 00:16:51,294
I'll be right back.
I'll be right back.

159
00:16:55,798 --> 00:16:59,761
- You!
- Hey! Junior.

160
00:17:00,887 --> 00:17:05,182
Who is he?
This is Vic. My father.

161
00:17:05,183 --> 00:17:07,433
Look, Junior, I know
how you might be upset.

162
00:17:07,434 --> 00:17:09,393
Upset?
Why would I be upset?

163
00:17:09,394 --> 00:17:12,064
You only abandoned me
in an alley as a kitten.

164
00:17:12,065 --> 00:17:14,150
I'm probably just overreacting!

165
00:17:26,037 --> 00:17:27,704
Oh, no, not her.

166
00:17:27,705 --> 00:17:30,958
- Okay, follow me, Junior.
- No, no, no.

167
00:17:30,959 --> 00:17:32,543
You lost the privilege
of telling me

168
00:17:32,544 --> 00:17:34,336
what to do a long time ago.

169
00:17:34,337 --> 00:17:37,840
- Hello, Vic.
- Dang it!

170
00:17:38,508 --> 00:17:43,012
Scare cam! You should've
seen your faces!

171
00:17:46,099 --> 00:17:48,351
Okay, boys, show me!

172
00:17:48,935 --> 00:17:50,394
Hello, Vic.

173
00:17:50,395 --> 00:17:51,646
Dang...

174
00:17:55,233 --> 00:17:56,859
Post that ASAP!

175
00:18:01,906 --> 00:18:06,452
What? Hey, Jinx!
I haven't seen you since...

176
00:18:07,537 --> 00:18:10,915
Well, no hard feelings
though, right?

177
00:18:12,542 --> 00:18:14,377
I don't think so.

178
00:18:16,170 --> 00:18:17,797
I'm a hugger!

179
00:18:18,756 --> 00:18:19,923
Part of me wants
to be mad at her

180
00:18:19,924 --> 00:18:22,050
for kidnapping us, but
you gotta love her energy.

181
00:18:22,051 --> 00:18:23,928
Where are my manners?

182
00:18:25,096 --> 00:18:26,514
Chop-chop, gentlemen!
Look alive!

183
00:18:41,779 --> 00:18:42,863
Perfection.

184
00:18:42,864 --> 00:18:45,032
You know, I was so delighted

185
00:18:45,033 --> 00:18:48,202
that you accepted my
invitation here tonight.

186
00:18:48,203 --> 00:18:49,745
Well, throwing us
in a burlap sack

187
00:18:49,746 --> 00:18:50,913
wasn't exactly an Evite.

188
00:18:50,914 --> 00:18:54,666
Vic, you're so quiet.
Are you feline sad?

189
00:18:54,667 --> 00:18:57,295
Cat got your tongue?
Would you prefer a mew-mosa?

190
00:18:58,046 --> 00:19:00,005
Excuse me, how do you
two know each other?

191
00:19:00,006 --> 00:19:03,091
- Let me handle this, Junior.
- Don't Junior me.

192
00:19:03,092 --> 00:19:06,553
You may call me Garfield,
Mr. Garfield, or G-Money.

193
00:19:06,554 --> 00:19:07,888
Okay, whatever, no G-Money.

194
00:19:07,889 --> 00:19:10,807
Anyway, can somebody please
tell me what is going on?

195
00:19:10,808 --> 00:19:12,851
We really don't
need to get into...

196
00:19:12,852 --> 00:19:14,103
I'll take this one.

197
00:19:19,567 --> 00:19:20,568
What?

198
00:19:21,152 --> 00:19:24,071
I'm from a small
town outside London

199
00:19:24,072 --> 00:19:25,740
that you've probably
never heard of.

200
00:19:26,824 --> 00:19:30,410
I scratched and clawed my
way through hard times...

201
00:19:30,411 --> 00:19:33,623
to come here with one dream.

202
00:19:43,925 --> 00:19:46,177
I wanted to be seen.

203
00:19:47,762 --> 00:19:50,014
I wanted to matter.

204
00:19:52,934 --> 00:19:55,602
But I was a failure.

205
00:19:55,603 --> 00:19:56,980
The winner!

206
00:20:01,859 --> 00:20:05,572
And then I met Vic and his crew.

207
00:20:06,489 --> 00:20:10,201
They were outcasts,
losers, thugs.

208
00:20:11,119 --> 00:20:13,663
We didn't have much,
but we had each other.

209
00:20:14,414 --> 00:20:16,624
We became a real family.

210
00:20:17,792 --> 00:20:20,252
Vic and family? I know
where this is goin'.

211
00:20:20,253 --> 00:20:21,336
Excuse me,

212
00:20:21,337 --> 00:20:23,964
garçon, when might
we expect appetizers?

213
00:20:23,965 --> 00:20:27,051
- Perhaps an amuse-bouche?
- And then one night...

214
00:20:28,094 --> 00:20:30,012
We were about to make
our biggest score.

215
00:20:30,013 --> 00:20:33,558
Enough milk to
last us for weeks.

216
00:20:38,187 --> 00:20:39,188
Vic!

217
00:20:41,232 --> 00:20:43,192
Vic!

218
00:20:45,320 --> 00:20:47,654
Jinx, I tried to
come back for you.

219
00:20:47,655 --> 00:20:49,072
You have to know that.

220
00:20:49,073 --> 00:20:52,576
- Yes, you get an A for effort.
- So, what happened next?

221
00:20:52,577 --> 00:20:56,079
Imagine Alcatraz...
but smellier.

222
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:59,333
It was cold. And lonely.

223
00:20:59,334 --> 00:21:03,671
And stinky. So very stinky.
I can't overstate that enough.

224
00:21:04,964 --> 00:21:08,218
But it gave me purpose.
I needed to get out.

225
00:21:08,885 --> 00:21:10,428
I just needed help.

226
00:21:24,859 --> 00:21:26,777
So, your purpose
was to escape jail

227
00:21:26,778 --> 00:21:28,403
and get involved with charities?

228
00:21:28,404 --> 00:21:30,281
No. My purpose was...

229
00:21:31,241 --> 00:21:32,492
revenge.

230
00:21:33,868 --> 00:21:35,410
I see, I went
the other way with it.

231
00:21:35,411 --> 00:21:37,329
I'm kidding.

232
00:21:37,330 --> 00:21:39,540
Another cat would
be bent on revenge,

233
00:21:39,541 --> 00:21:42,209
but I'm...
How would you put it?

234
00:21:42,210 --> 00:21:43,627
Evolved, compassionate,

235
00:21:43,628 --> 00:21:46,965
- and incredibly self-actualized.
- Bingo!

236
00:21:47,715 --> 00:21:49,591
I had such trouble finding him

237
00:21:49,592 --> 00:21:51,802
and when I discovered
you were his son,

238
00:21:51,803 --> 00:21:54,846
I had no choice but to
kidnap you to lure him here.

239
00:21:54,847 --> 00:21:56,848
No, listen, I totally get it.

240
00:21:56,849 --> 00:21:59,435
It's all part of bein'
associated with Vic.

241
00:22:00,061 --> 00:22:03,522
So, what do you need from
him to make this right?

242
00:22:03,523 --> 00:22:05,065
I simply want him to pay back

243
00:22:05,066 --> 00:22:06,775
the quart of milk
I lost that night

244
00:22:06,776 --> 00:22:08,777
- and we'll call it even.
- I can do that.

245
00:22:08,778 --> 00:22:09,987
What he can't do
is raise a child.

246
00:22:09,988 --> 00:22:11,488
- Just one quart.
- Just one quart.

247
00:22:11,489 --> 00:22:12,614
- Done.
- Done.

248
00:22:12,615 --> 00:22:14,116
For every day
I was in the pound.

249
00:22:14,117 --> 00:22:16,368
- What now?
- Nice twist. Well played.

250
00:22:16,369 --> 00:22:17,911
How long were you
in the pound again?

251
00:22:17,912 --> 00:22:20,038
Four years, seven
months and two days.

252
00:22:20,039 --> 00:22:21,123
That long?

253
00:22:21,124 --> 00:22:22,583
All right, I'm gonna
do the math here

254
00:22:22,584 --> 00:22:25,544
in my brain. The way
you do that is...

255
00:22:25,545 --> 00:22:29,006
Odie?
1,675 quarts of milk.

256
00:22:29,007 --> 00:22:31,008
Exactly right, Odie.
We both came up with it

257
00:22:31,009 --> 00:22:32,092
at the exact same time.

258
00:22:32,093 --> 00:22:34,845
Where am I gonna
find that much milk?

259
00:22:34,846 --> 00:22:36,889
Well, I suggest you
go back to the place

260
00:22:36,890 --> 00:22:38,432
you double-crossed me.

261
00:22:38,433 --> 00:22:42,770
- Lactose Farms.
- Well, good luck, Vic!

262
00:22:43,855 --> 00:22:45,898
I'll leave you two to
work out the fine print.

263
00:22:45,899 --> 00:22:47,984
We'll just see
ourselves out. Odie?

264
00:22:49,235 --> 00:22:51,695
No.
You're all going to do this.

265
00:22:51,696 --> 00:22:53,113
What? Wait, why me?

266
00:22:53,114 --> 00:22:54,907
He's the one who abandoned you.

267
00:22:54,908 --> 00:22:57,367
Yes, but this is more
than a one-cat job.

268
00:22:57,368 --> 00:22:58,911
Yeah, but I'm sure
Vic has a whole crew

269
00:22:58,912 --> 00:23:00,913
of low-life cat
burglars he could ask.

270
00:23:00,914 --> 00:23:02,456
I'm sure he does.

271
00:23:02,457 --> 00:23:04,082
But if I'm being
completely honest,

272
00:23:04,083 --> 00:23:05,792
seeing how miserable
you make one another

273
00:23:05,793 --> 00:23:07,961
brings me endless satisfaction.

274
00:23:07,962 --> 00:23:10,088
Well, thank you
for your honesty.

275
00:23:10,089 --> 00:23:12,466
And if I don't go?

276
00:23:12,467 --> 00:23:15,719
You can stay and have a
playdate with Roland and Nolan.

277
00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:18,723
Okay, boys... go play!

278
00:23:27,398 --> 00:23:29,274
Ma'am, I think this
is an opportunity

279
00:23:29,275 --> 00:23:31,235
to take a deep,
cleansing breath...

280
00:23:31,236 --> 00:23:34,405
and repeat your anger
management mantra.

281
00:23:39,869 --> 00:23:41,412
Anyone else have any objections?

282
00:23:42,372 --> 00:23:44,748
Nope, I'm good. Thanks
for the opportunity.

283
00:23:44,749 --> 00:23:48,962
Excellent! Now, you
boys have 72 hours.

284
00:23:53,258 --> 00:23:54,425
Or else...

285
00:23:56,803 --> 00:23:57,886
I can't believe
this is happening!

286
00:23:57,887 --> 00:23:59,846
I don't see you for
years and when I do,

287
00:23:59,847 --> 00:24:01,265
you pull me into
a life of crime!

288
00:24:01,266 --> 00:24:03,267
I had this reunion playing
differently in my head too.

289
00:24:03,268 --> 00:24:04,643
Well, that's the
difference between us,

290
00:24:04,644 --> 00:24:06,853
because I never wanted
to see you again!

291
00:24:06,854 --> 00:24:08,564
Now, I totally
understand your anger.

292
00:24:08,565 --> 00:24:10,524
But if you give me
a chance to explain

293
00:24:10,525 --> 00:24:12,192
you'll see I'm not the
bad guy you think I am.

294
00:24:12,193 --> 00:24:15,153
A good guy doesn't leave
his kid in an alley!

295
00:24:15,154 --> 00:24:16,905
- It wasn't like that.
- It was exactly like that!

296
00:24:16,906 --> 00:24:18,407
No, it wasn't.

297
00:24:18,408 --> 00:24:19,825
- Let me tell you what, Junior...
- No, no!

298
00:24:19,826 --> 00:24:22,202
I don't wanna hear it!
This whole thing with Jinx?

299
00:24:22,203 --> 00:24:25,456
This is your mess, not mine.
Come on, Odie.

300
00:24:26,833 --> 00:24:28,376
Can't let you do that.

301
00:24:29,878 --> 00:24:31,628
We'll be watching you.

302
00:24:31,629 --> 00:24:32,881
Like a hawk.

303
00:24:43,266 --> 00:24:44,308
Is today a Monday?

304
00:24:44,309 --> 00:24:45,934
Because it feels an
awful lot like a Monday.

305
00:24:45,935 --> 00:24:47,019
It's Thursday.

306
00:24:47,020 --> 00:24:50,480
- Not to me, it's not!
- Look, I know this isn't ideal,

307
00:24:50,481 --> 00:24:53,525
but we have to do this.
So, let's just try and make

308
00:24:53,526 --> 00:24:56,445
- the best of our time together.
- Our time together?

309
00:24:56,446 --> 00:24:58,697
What are you talkin' about?
Once we get this milk,

310
00:24:58,698 --> 00:25:01,074
I want you out of my life.
Forever!

311
00:25:01,075 --> 00:25:02,868
All right, just relax.

312
00:25:02,869 --> 00:25:04,411
Lactose Farms ain't nothing

313
00:25:04,412 --> 00:25:06,246
but a sleepy little
mom-and-pop dairy.

314
00:25:06,247 --> 00:25:07,873
This will be a
quick grab and go.

315
00:25:07,874 --> 00:25:09,394
You'll be back home
before you know it.

316
00:25:11,085 --> 00:25:14,046
So, how do we even
get to Lactose Farms?

317
00:25:14,047 --> 00:25:15,464
It's way out in the country.

318
00:25:15,465 --> 00:25:16,674
You ever jumped a train?

319
00:25:17,550 --> 00:25:19,051
I've never jumped.

320
00:25:19,052 --> 00:25:22,221
Look, if jumpin' a train
is too hard, just say it.

321
00:25:22,222 --> 00:25:24,349
- How hard could it be?
- Exactly!

322
00:25:25,558 --> 00:25:27,769
This is gonna be fun.

323
00:25:30,355 --> 00:25:31,605
Garfield?

324
00:25:31,606 --> 00:25:33,691
Odie? Hello?

325
00:25:35,526 --> 00:25:37,819
Garfield, how many
times have I told you

326
00:25:37,820 --> 00:25:40,114
to close the
refrigerator door?

327
00:25:41,574 --> 00:25:43,201
Wait, there's food on the floor.

328
00:25:44,285 --> 00:25:48,122
He's never left food
on the floor. Garfield?

329
00:25:49,499 --> 00:25:53,835
Garfield? Garfield? Garfield?

330
00:25:53,836 --> 00:25:57,048
Garfield? Garfield? Garfield?

331
00:26:02,345 --> 00:26:04,346
Our best shot at jumping
on the train is here.

332
00:26:04,347 --> 00:26:06,139
Hold on a sec. I'm just
taking in the wind speed,

333
00:26:06,140 --> 00:26:09,059
the direction of the sun,
and various angles.

334
00:26:09,060 --> 00:26:11,228
Yes, I say we jump the
train from right here.

335
00:26:11,229 --> 00:26:12,479
Didn't I just say that?

336
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:13,939
I've seen it on television
a million times.

337
00:26:13,940 --> 00:26:16,358
- We'll need a 100 feet of rope.
- Uh-huh, rope. Yeah, okay.

338
00:26:16,359 --> 00:26:17,484
- Great idea.
- Yep.

339
00:26:17,485 --> 00:26:18,735
We'll throw the rope
over that branch

340
00:26:18,736 --> 00:26:20,195
- right there.
- Over the branch. Got it.

341
00:26:20,196 --> 00:26:23,740
Can you follow me? All right.
And then timing it just right,

342
00:26:23,741 --> 00:26:26,201
we swing over as
the train passes by

343
00:26:26,202 --> 00:26:28,370
and land on top of the car.

344
00:26:28,371 --> 00:26:30,623
- Boom!
- Or, we can do this!

345
00:26:32,792 --> 00:26:34,002
Odie, jump, boy!

346
00:26:47,140 --> 00:26:48,807
Part of me wants to help him.

347
00:26:48,808 --> 00:26:51,144
No. This is how he learns.

348
00:27:00,445 --> 00:27:01,737
I don't know,
it's kind of pricey.

349
00:27:01,738 --> 00:27:02,822
How does it handle?

350
00:27:04,574 --> 00:27:05,575
I'll take it!

351
00:27:17,587 --> 00:27:20,548
See? I told you this
was gonna be fun.

352
00:27:21,424 --> 00:27:23,927
You and I have different
definitions of fun.

353
00:27:26,596 --> 00:27:28,972
- Hello?
- Finally! Hello!

354
00:27:28,973 --> 00:27:30,766
You've reached Find My Pet.

355
00:27:30,767 --> 00:27:32,559
If your pet is lost,
we're here to help.

356
00:27:32,560 --> 00:27:35,520
Hi, yes! Great, okay.
My orange tabby and my dog

357
00:27:35,521 --> 00:27:37,522
are both missing and
I need your help.

358
00:27:37,523 --> 00:27:38,690
Please listen carefully

359
00:27:38,691 --> 00:27:39,942
as our menu options
have changed.

360
00:27:39,943 --> 00:27:41,026
- Okay.
- If you'd like to hear

361
00:27:41,027 --> 00:27:42,110
this call in Spanish...

362
00:27:42,111 --> 00:27:43,195
- oprima número dos.
- What?

363
00:27:43,196 --> 00:27:44,488
For Pig Latin,
ess-pray even-say.

364
00:27:44,489 --> 00:27:45,572
For gibberish...

365
00:27:45,573 --> 00:27:47,908
Come on. What do I press
to talk to a real person?

366
00:27:47,909 --> 00:27:49,701
Your call is very
important to us.

367
00:27:49,702 --> 00:27:53,539
There are 1,346
people ahead of you.

368
00:27:53,540 --> 00:27:56,626
What?
Garfield, where are you?

369
00:28:02,131 --> 00:28:04,384
Okay, Vic, you gotta
figure this out.

370
00:28:05,510 --> 00:28:07,302
Jinx can't be trusted

371
00:28:07,303 --> 00:28:11,640
and you gotta keep Junior safe!
You just gotta figure out a way

372
00:28:11,641 --> 00:28:16,895
- to get him outta this.
- Tell me, is it a bur? It hurts.

373
00:28:16,896 --> 00:28:19,482
You pulled my hair.

374
00:28:20,358 --> 00:28:22,318
Is it a gnat?
Is it a bug? A bug?

375
00:28:22,860 --> 00:28:26,406
Odie, Odie!

376
00:28:29,492 --> 00:28:30,577
Okay.

377
00:28:36,249 --> 00:28:37,249
You know what, Junior?

378
00:28:37,250 --> 00:28:40,836
- This is gonna be good for you.
- What'll be good for me?

379
00:28:40,837 --> 00:28:41,920
What we're doing.

380
00:28:41,921 --> 00:28:43,422
We're about to steal
a truck full of milk

381
00:28:43,423 --> 00:28:45,799
from a dairy to pay
back a deranged cat.

382
00:28:45,800 --> 00:28:48,468
What part of that is
going to be good for me?

383
00:28:48,469 --> 00:28:50,721
All of it!
You can't even imagine

384
00:28:50,722 --> 00:28:52,389
the life lessons
you're gonna learn.

385
00:28:52,390 --> 00:28:54,057
Oh, yeah? Name one.

386
00:28:54,058 --> 00:28:56,268
Well, for starters,
you already know

387
00:28:56,269 --> 00:28:58,062
how to get on a moving train.

388
00:29:02,650 --> 00:29:04,151
I found it funny.

389
00:29:04,152 --> 00:29:06,862
All I'm sayin' is that
to break into a dairy,

390
00:29:06,863 --> 00:29:08,280
it's going to take
a few skills...

391
00:29:08,281 --> 00:29:10,032
I'm guessing a
rounded, mush-filled,

392
00:29:10,033 --> 00:29:11,993
overly pampered
indoor cat like you...

393
00:29:12,619 --> 00:29:15,704
doesn't have,
so we need to toughen you up.

394
00:29:15,705 --> 00:29:19,082
Toughen me up?
Hey, I know tough, Vic.

395
00:29:19,083 --> 00:29:21,251
You've obviously never
been in an Olive Garden

396
00:29:21,252 --> 00:29:23,087
that's run out of breadsticks.

397
00:29:24,297 --> 00:29:26,340
Anyway, I'm never
gonna need those skills

398
00:29:26,341 --> 00:29:28,258
- you're talking about.
- But you'll have them.

399
00:29:28,259 --> 00:29:30,219
I'm never gonna
break into a dairy

400
00:29:30,220 --> 00:29:32,137
or anything else, ever again.

401
00:29:32,138 --> 00:29:34,139
You are missing the point.

402
00:29:34,140 --> 00:29:35,557
You're going to
learn to improvise,

403
00:29:35,558 --> 00:29:37,142
think on your feet,
develop moves

404
00:29:37,143 --> 00:29:39,853
that'll come in handy out
there in the real world!

405
00:29:39,854 --> 00:29:41,855
I wouldn't be in
the real world

406
00:29:41,856 --> 00:29:43,023
if it wasn't for you!

407
00:29:43,024 --> 00:29:45,859
True. You'd still be hanging
upside down in the mall.

408
00:29:45,860 --> 00:29:50,073
- No, I would be asleep at home!
- Missing out on life altogether.

409
00:29:51,032 --> 00:29:54,159
Look, I'm just a dad trying
to teach his son some skills.

410
00:29:54,160 --> 00:29:57,162
No, no, no. You can't
make up for five years

411
00:29:57,163 --> 00:29:59,206
- of not being around.
- Yes, I can.

412
00:29:59,207 --> 00:30:00,624
- No, you can't.
- I think I can.

413
00:30:00,625 --> 00:30:02,084
- In fact, you can't.
- Yes, I can!

414
00:30:02,085 --> 00:30:04,671
- You really can't!
- With your attitude, I can.

415
00:30:05,547 --> 00:30:08,716
Okay, whatever, Dad.
Great lesson.

416
00:30:09,384 --> 00:30:11,051
I'm done talking to you.

417
00:30:11,052 --> 00:30:12,511
You do not know me,

418
00:30:12,512 --> 00:30:14,346
you don't know the
first thing about me.

419
00:30:14,347 --> 00:30:18,434
I am not pampered. I'm not
anything you think I am!

420
00:30:24,732 --> 00:30:26,191
Okay. I'm just gonna say

421
00:30:26,192 --> 00:30:28,944
that blanket is
not the best idea.

422
00:30:28,945 --> 00:30:31,239
Fantastic, thank you.
I'll take it from here.

423
00:30:34,617 --> 00:30:36,286
Get them off! Get them off!

424
00:30:37,161 --> 00:30:41,165
Get them off me!
What are you doin'?

425
00:30:46,713 --> 00:30:48,255
- What did you do?
- Cedar chips.

426
00:30:48,256 --> 00:30:51,758
Spiders hate 'em. See?
Another life skill learned.

427
00:30:51,759 --> 00:30:52,926
I...

428
00:30:52,927 --> 00:30:55,138
I think the words you're
looking for are...

429
00:30:55,722 --> 00:30:56,763
Thank you, Pops.

430
00:30:56,764 --> 00:30:58,640
No, the word
I'm looking for is...

431
00:30:58,641 --> 00:31:01,060
- Here's our stop!
- Really? Where?

432
00:31:06,316 --> 00:31:08,192
Odie, you think
he'd see that coming.

433
00:31:27,795 --> 00:31:28,963
Cheese!

434
00:31:29,839 --> 00:31:31,591
- Take your picture.
- Yeah!

435
00:31:33,551 --> 00:31:35,344
Yeah!

436
00:31:35,345 --> 00:31:37,263
Here you go!

437
00:31:49,817 --> 00:31:52,110
Quaint. Just a simple
little grab and go.

438
00:31:52,111 --> 00:31:54,196
Okay. Okay, so they've
done a few upgrades

439
00:31:54,197 --> 00:31:56,490
since I was last here.
Why being so dramatic?

440
00:31:56,491 --> 00:31:58,284
All we have to do is
climb the fence...

441
00:32:28,314 --> 00:32:30,274
Wait. Is that Otto?

442
00:32:30,275 --> 00:32:31,858
- Who?
- Otto!

443
00:32:31,859 --> 00:32:33,193
Of Otto and Ethel.

444
00:32:33,194 --> 00:32:35,445
No clue who you're
talkin' about.

445
00:32:35,446 --> 00:32:37,781
He's one of the mascots
of Lactose Farms.

446
00:32:37,782 --> 00:32:39,701
See?
On the side of the barn?

447
00:32:41,202 --> 00:32:42,828
I'll bet he knows how
to get into that place.

448
00:32:42,829 --> 00:32:43,996
Leave him alone.

449
00:32:43,997 --> 00:32:47,124
Seems to be in a period of
meditation... or depression.

450
00:32:47,125 --> 00:32:48,293
Yes, he does.

451
00:32:49,335 --> 00:32:51,962
This calls for tact,
sensitivity, and diplomacy.

452
00:32:51,963 --> 00:32:54,423
Yeah? And where are we
supposed to get that?

453
00:32:54,424 --> 00:32:56,592
I have it. In spades.

454
00:32:56,593 --> 00:32:58,511
Watch! Maybe you'll
learn somethin'.

455
00:33:01,514 --> 00:33:03,433
Excuse me, you're Otto, right?

456
00:33:08,354 --> 00:33:09,354
I'm Garfield.

457
00:33:09,355 --> 00:33:10,939
- A pleasure.
- Go away.

458
00:33:10,940 --> 00:33:12,816
I just wanted to
say I am a huge fan.

459
00:33:12,817 --> 00:33:14,318
I have eaten everything

460
00:33:14,319 --> 00:33:15,736
that has a picture
of your face on it.

461
00:33:15,737 --> 00:33:17,070
I'm not that guy anymore.

462
00:33:17,071 --> 00:33:19,531
I even loved that recalled
provolone from a few years back.

463
00:33:19,532 --> 00:33:20,699
- Junior, no.
- Yeah.

464
00:33:20,700 --> 00:33:23,327
Anyways, here's the thing.
Me and my crew back there,

465
00:33:23,328 --> 00:33:25,954
we're in a bit of a bind.
Got ourselves in a situation.

466
00:33:25,955 --> 00:33:28,333
Long story short,
we could use your help.

467
00:33:30,335 --> 00:33:31,419
You're a fan, huh?

468
00:33:32,378 --> 00:33:35,214
- Yes! Big time.
- Then sing the jingle.

469
00:33:35,215 --> 00:33:38,091
Well, I don't really
sing on command.

470
00:33:38,092 --> 00:33:39,509
I'm not a circus animal.

471
00:33:39,510 --> 00:33:41,429
- Sing it.
- Really?

472
00:33:42,347 --> 00:33:46,392
- Sing it.
- Lactose Farms, Lactose Farms

473
00:33:47,101 --> 00:33:49,269
We've got milks, butters,
creams and cheeses

474
00:33:49,270 --> 00:33:51,271
- More spirit.
- Much as you want

475
00:33:51,272 --> 00:33:52,648
- As much as it pleases...
- Livelier!

476
00:33:52,649 --> 00:33:54,900
Come and take a look
and see what we got

477
00:33:54,901 --> 00:33:56,945
'Cause what we got
is a whole lotta lot

478
00:34:01,449 --> 00:34:04,785
Tasty goodness is our
motto brought to you

479
00:34:04,786 --> 00:34:08,122
By Ethel and Otto!

480
00:34:09,957 --> 00:34:11,291
What was that for?

481
00:34:11,292 --> 00:34:12,626
I hate that jingle.

482
00:34:12,627 --> 00:34:15,088
You could've just
told me to stop.

483
00:34:36,943 --> 00:34:38,903
Let's go.
Kids are waiting.

484
00:34:52,625 --> 00:34:53,625
Odie, come back!

485
00:34:53,626 --> 00:34:55,169
Leave him alone!
He might punch you!

486
00:35:07,807 --> 00:35:09,767
Was that Ethel?

487
00:35:16,232 --> 00:35:17,816
A few years back,

488
00:35:17,817 --> 00:35:20,612
Old Man Lactose was
forced out of business.

489
00:35:21,613 --> 00:35:25,867
The corporation that took over
separated me from my Ethel.

490
00:35:27,285 --> 00:35:29,953
- Ethel!
- You are my day!

491
00:35:29,954 --> 00:35:31,539
You are my night!

492
00:35:33,958 --> 00:35:35,919
I was put out to pasture.

493
00:35:38,379 --> 00:35:41,257
She was put on display
as part of the tour.

494
00:35:44,677 --> 00:35:46,303
I tried to get in there

495
00:35:46,304 --> 00:35:50,350
to break Ethel free...
but they stop me every time.

496
00:35:51,809 --> 00:35:56,647
Now, I only see her six
seconds, twice a day.

497
00:35:56,648 --> 00:35:58,565
We feel you, Otto.

498
00:35:58,566 --> 00:36:00,067
Come on, let's go, Junior.

499
00:36:00,068 --> 00:36:01,818
We'll find another
way to break in there.

500
00:36:01,819 --> 00:36:05,239
What could you possibly
want from that place?

501
00:36:05,240 --> 00:36:07,366
You know, a couple
quarts of milk.

502
00:36:07,367 --> 00:36:09,284
Couple thousand quarts.

503
00:36:09,285 --> 00:36:10,786
Good luck.

504
00:36:10,787 --> 00:36:12,704
We'll take any helpful
hints you have.

505
00:36:12,705 --> 00:36:13,830
Pass.

506
00:36:13,831 --> 00:36:16,083
I'm telling you, it's a
life-or-death situation.

507
00:36:16,084 --> 00:36:19,087
Then I hope you've
notified your next of kin.

508
00:36:20,838 --> 00:36:22,047
What if we can get Ethel out?

509
00:36:22,048 --> 00:36:23,591
Or get you a commemorative pin?

510
00:36:28,054 --> 00:36:29,847
Where are we gonna find
a commemorative pin?

511
00:36:31,724 --> 00:36:33,100
Now, pay attention.

512
00:36:33,101 --> 00:36:35,227
Here's the perimeter
of the plant.

513
00:36:35,228 --> 00:36:37,564
And here are the two
places you need to go.

514
00:36:38,106 --> 00:36:41,359
First, the truck with
your milk is back here.

515
00:36:42,277 --> 00:36:45,070
And this delicate
buttercup is my Ethel.

516
00:36:45,071 --> 00:36:47,864
My North Star, and
reason for living

517
00:36:47,865 --> 00:36:52,661
is being kept by those
barbarians in a petting zoo.

518
00:36:52,662 --> 00:36:54,038
Located here.

519
00:36:55,248 --> 00:36:58,041
This cricket represents
the electrical room...

520
00:36:58,042 --> 00:37:00,127
this snail, the
refrigeration room...

521
00:37:00,128 --> 00:37:02,713
this toadstool is
the loading dock

522
00:37:02,714 --> 00:37:05,007
where you'll find the
keys to the trucks.

523
00:37:05,008 --> 00:37:06,341
Wait, what's the pinecone?

524
00:37:06,342 --> 00:37:08,594
The pinecone is the
cheese and butter room.

525
00:37:08,595 --> 00:37:12,306
- Cheese is my love language.
- Now, for this briefing,

526
00:37:12,307 --> 00:37:14,433
I've done a quick reading
of your personalities

527
00:37:14,434 --> 00:37:17,269
and have chosen tokens
to represent each of you.

528
00:37:17,270 --> 00:37:19,647
You are the majestic bullfrog.

529
00:37:23,026 --> 00:37:24,943
Yeah, that feels right.

530
00:37:24,944 --> 00:37:27,946
You are the curious
and clever chipmunk.

531
00:37:27,947 --> 00:37:29,824
- And you...
- Wait for it...

532
00:37:30,783 --> 00:37:32,243
are roadkill.

533
00:37:33,203 --> 00:37:38,290
What? No, I get it.
That's a good one, Otto!

534
00:37:38,291 --> 00:37:40,042
Giving your new best
friend roadkill.

535
00:37:40,043 --> 00:37:42,753
Seriously, though,
what's my real token?

536
00:37:42,754 --> 00:37:44,297
That is your real token.

537
00:37:44,839 --> 00:37:46,840
Now, if you have any
chance of succeeding...

538
00:37:46,841 --> 00:37:48,842
Wait, can I... Excuse me,
can I switch to something living?

539
00:37:48,843 --> 00:37:51,261
- Like the snail or the cricket?
- You should've spoken up sooner.

540
00:37:51,262 --> 00:37:53,513
At this point, it would be
too confusing to switch.

541
00:37:53,514 --> 00:37:55,766
Sooner? But you just told me
this five seconds ago.

542
00:37:55,767 --> 00:37:58,060
- Come on, Roadkill, focus.
- Really?

543
00:37:58,061 --> 00:38:00,270
You give Vic the
majestic bullfrog.

544
00:38:00,271 --> 00:38:02,564
You give Odie the curious
and clever chipmunk...

545
00:38:02,565 --> 00:38:05,359
and then you give me,
your new bff, roadkill?

546
00:38:05,360 --> 00:38:07,444
I mean, it feels
disrespectful, not gonna lie.

547
00:38:07,445 --> 00:38:08,987
What makes you think he's dead?

548
00:38:08,988 --> 00:38:10,948
My eyes. I have
eyes and can see.

549
00:38:10,949 --> 00:38:13,200
It's a possum. They're
masters at playing dead.

550
00:38:13,201 --> 00:38:14,993
Well then, little
Daniel Day-Possum here

551
00:38:14,994 --> 00:38:16,286
should do Shakespeare
in the Park!

552
00:38:16,287 --> 00:38:17,496
Things aren't always
what they seem.

553
00:38:17,497 --> 00:38:18,872
You're right. But in
this case, they are.

554
00:38:18,873 --> 00:38:20,624
What's the big deal?
Possums play dead.

555
00:38:20,625 --> 00:38:22,167
Do they, Otto?
Do they play dead?

556
00:38:22,168 --> 00:38:23,835
Do possums play possum,
is that what they do?

557
00:38:23,836 --> 00:38:25,712
Yes. Possums are very clever.

558
00:38:25,713 --> 00:38:26,880
Yeah, I'm sure he was

559
00:38:26,881 --> 00:38:28,549
until the day
he ate a pick-up truck!

560
00:38:28,550 --> 00:38:31,301
Just ignore him.
Please, continue.

561
00:38:31,302 --> 00:38:33,096
I'll just put this
back where you had it.

562
00:38:33,930 --> 00:38:35,973
The straightest line
to the loading dock

563
00:38:35,974 --> 00:38:38,934
is through the snail here,
then the cricket, there,

564
00:38:38,935 --> 00:38:41,687
cut through the toadstool
and onto the rock.

565
00:38:41,688 --> 00:38:43,730
Each of these rooms
have their own set

566
00:38:43,731 --> 00:38:45,732
- of unique challenges.
- Well, why can't we just go

567
00:38:45,733 --> 00:38:46,858
straight through the pinecone?

568
00:38:46,859 --> 00:38:48,485
You don't want to go
through the pinecone.

569
00:38:48,486 --> 00:38:50,070
Looks like the straightest
shot is through the pinecone.

570
00:38:50,071 --> 00:38:51,905
You like walking with
those feet, do you?

571
00:38:51,906 --> 00:38:54,783
You a fan of unimaginable
pain and misery?

572
00:38:54,784 --> 00:38:56,952
Then go through the pinecone.

573
00:38:56,953 --> 00:38:58,954
Stay away from the
pinecone. Got it.

574
00:38:58,955 --> 00:39:00,665
Once you're inside
the facility...

575
00:39:01,833 --> 00:39:03,793
You will enter the
electrical room.

576
00:39:04,460 --> 00:39:06,170
There you will
locate the air vent.

577
00:39:08,298 --> 00:39:10,341
Pop the grate and climb up.

578
00:39:12,677 --> 00:39:18,099
Then, you'll crawl through a
maze of vents and drop down...

579
00:39:19,350 --> 00:39:20,518
to the refrigeration room.

580
00:39:21,477 --> 00:39:23,312
Next, you will need
to hurl your body

581
00:39:23,313 --> 00:39:26,107
over a 30-foot drop
to a series of hand rungs.

582
00:39:27,483 --> 00:39:29,526
You'll propel yourselves
hand-over-hand...

583
00:39:29,527 --> 00:39:32,780
and drop down directly
into a loading dock.

584
00:39:33,823 --> 00:39:36,951
From there, you'll locate
the keys to the milk truck.

585
00:39:37,952 --> 00:39:40,245
Drive that truck to the
west pasture of the complex,

586
00:39:40,246 --> 00:39:41,497
cut the lock on the gate.

587
00:39:42,081 --> 00:39:44,208
And find the closest
thing we have

588
00:39:44,209 --> 00:39:47,086
to an angel here on earth.

589
00:39:50,632 --> 00:39:53,342
You'll escort my sweet
Ethel onto the truck

590
00:39:53,343 --> 00:39:55,553
and drive her to freedom.

591
00:39:57,180 --> 00:39:59,097
It's going to take mad skills

592
00:39:59,098 --> 00:40:02,726
to get that milk, and
free my dear, sweet Ethel.

593
00:40:02,727 --> 00:40:05,062
Clearly, this one is
qualified for the mission.

594
00:40:05,063 --> 00:40:08,899
But, I have some serious
doubts here about all of...

595
00:40:08,900 --> 00:40:12,027
- this.
- He's pointing to you, Roadkill.

596
00:40:12,028 --> 00:40:14,864
Let's get to work.

597
00:40:16,574 --> 00:40:17,991
Stupid roadkill.

598
00:40:17,992 --> 00:40:20,370
Hey! I'm workin' here!

599
00:40:21,871 --> 00:40:23,790
Definitely a Monday.

600
00:40:24,707 --> 00:40:26,333
Your call is fairly
important to us.

601
00:40:26,334 --> 00:40:28,293
If you've lost a cat,
please press one.

602
00:40:28,294 --> 00:40:29,795
- If your cat is orange...
- Yeah.

603
00:40:29,796 --> 00:40:31,046
Please press two.

604
00:40:31,047 --> 00:40:33,090
This doesn't really
accomplish anything...

605
00:40:33,091 --> 00:40:34,424
but gives you the false sense

606
00:40:34,425 --> 00:40:35,843
that we're engaged with you.

607
00:40:40,139 --> 00:40:42,767
All right, gentlemen,
I've made a list of skills...

608
00:40:43,810 --> 00:40:45,561
that you'll need
to master in order

609
00:40:45,562 --> 00:40:48,188
to break into Lactose Farms.
Number one,

610
00:40:48,189 --> 00:40:50,440
develop lightning-fast reflexes.

611
00:40:50,441 --> 00:40:52,150
You tell Garfield
there's a plate of pasta

612
00:40:52,151 --> 00:40:53,277
on the other side of that wall

613
00:40:53,278 --> 00:40:55,529
and you will see
lightning reflexes.

614
00:40:55,530 --> 00:40:57,656
Yeah, no, no, no. Depends
what kind of pasta.

615
00:40:57,657 --> 00:41:01,076
This pebble represents
danger you may encounter.

616
00:41:01,077 --> 00:41:03,662
You need to grab it,
before it grabs you.

617
00:41:03,663 --> 00:41:04,788
It grabs me?

618
00:41:04,789 --> 00:41:06,582
Snatch the pebble from my hand.

619
00:41:06,583 --> 00:41:07,667
Too slow!

620
00:41:08,418 --> 00:41:09,459
What was that for?

621
00:41:09,460 --> 00:41:11,420
Being able to grab
the pebble could be

622
00:41:11,421 --> 00:41:13,422
the difference between
life and death.

623
00:41:13,423 --> 00:41:15,216
All right,
let me try that again.

624
00:41:16,843 --> 00:41:17,844
Got it!

625
00:41:18,803 --> 00:41:19,803
Now what was that for?

626
00:41:19,804 --> 00:41:21,430
It's never just
about the pebble.

627
00:41:21,431 --> 00:41:23,098
Come on, Junior,
everyone knows that.

628
00:41:23,099 --> 00:41:25,893
Your head's got to be on
a swivel at all times.

629
00:41:25,894 --> 00:41:27,019
Gotta be ready for anything.

630
00:41:27,020 --> 00:41:28,854
I was ready.
He changed the game.

631
00:41:28,855 --> 00:41:31,024
Sounds like someone's
making excuses!

632
00:41:34,152 --> 00:41:36,028
And what was that about
being ready for anything?

633
00:41:36,029 --> 00:41:37,613
You were distracting me!

634
00:41:37,614 --> 00:41:39,406
Might I suggest putting
your head on a swivel?

635
00:41:39,407 --> 00:41:40,657
You should have
seen that coming.

636
00:41:40,658 --> 00:41:42,618
Toes on the line!
Guard your grill!

637
00:41:42,619 --> 00:41:43,744
Cover your stomach!

638
00:41:43,745 --> 00:41:45,871
There are surprises
around every corner

639
00:41:45,872 --> 00:41:48,457
at Lactose Farms.
You need to stay alert!

640
00:41:48,458 --> 00:41:50,876
Too slow! A baby could
have seen that coming!

641
00:41:50,877 --> 00:41:54,005
Too slow! Too slow!

642
00:41:55,840 --> 00:41:56,883
Too slow!

643
00:41:57,717 --> 00:41:59,801
You'll never make it
through Lactose Farms

644
00:41:59,802 --> 00:42:01,345
if you can't survive
this training!

645
00:42:01,346 --> 00:42:02,554
Are you for real?

646
00:42:02,555 --> 00:42:04,264
What kinda dairy is this?

647
00:42:04,265 --> 00:42:07,185
The kind of dairy that
requires teamwork to survive!

648
00:42:07,936 --> 00:42:09,687
Danger could be
anywhere, gentlemen!

649
00:42:11,314 --> 00:42:13,191
You've got to be
ready to outrun it.

650
00:42:17,362 --> 00:42:18,780
Here comes the pain!

651
00:42:19,614 --> 00:42:21,741
- Left, right, left, right.
- You're confusing me!

652
00:42:37,257 --> 00:42:38,967
I think I'm gonna need rehab.

653
00:42:43,721 --> 00:42:45,222
If this is going to work,

654
00:42:45,223 --> 00:42:47,558
these two have to
be on the same page.

655
00:42:47,559 --> 00:42:49,059
I'm out of ideas.

656
00:42:49,060 --> 00:42:50,228
You got any?

657
00:42:52,897 --> 00:42:54,856
Can't believe I'm out
in the middle of nowhere

658
00:42:54,857 --> 00:42:56,692
getting beaten up
against my will

659
00:42:56,693 --> 00:42:58,820
by a former celebrity steer.

660
00:42:59,571 --> 00:43:03,407
Odie? Will you tell my son
to please stop whining?

661
00:43:03,408 --> 00:43:04,908
Odie, can you tell Vic

662
00:43:04,909 --> 00:43:06,451
that I collapsed
on this tree first

663
00:43:06,452 --> 00:43:07,995
and that he needs
to find another one?

664
00:43:07,996 --> 00:43:10,372
Odie, can you tell my son

665
00:43:10,373 --> 00:43:12,791
that I will gladly
find another one

666
00:43:12,792 --> 00:43:14,751
when I get the feeling
back in my legs?

667
00:43:14,752 --> 00:43:16,628
Odie, can you tell my father

668
00:43:16,629 --> 00:43:18,088
that he wouldn't
be lying in pain

669
00:43:18,089 --> 00:43:19,172
if he led a better life

670
00:43:19,173 --> 00:43:20,716
and didn't create
problems for himself?

671
00:43:20,717 --> 00:43:24,303
Could you please inform my son

672
00:43:24,304 --> 00:43:26,889
that he should focus on
fixing his own issues?

673
00:43:26,890 --> 00:43:28,349
Odie? What?

674
00:43:29,392 --> 00:43:31,019
Odie? What'd you do?

675
00:43:31,853 --> 00:43:34,230
After all I've
let you do for me.

676
00:43:35,690 --> 00:43:36,816
What is this?

677
00:43:38,776 --> 00:43:40,361
Hey, watch it!

678
00:43:43,448 --> 00:43:46,701
What's the problem, Vic?
Is this bothering you?

679
00:43:48,536 --> 00:43:52,665
No. In fact, I don't
mind it at all!

680
00:43:54,626 --> 00:43:56,336
I don't mind it either.

681
00:44:01,174 --> 00:44:02,925
I could watch this all day.

682
00:44:02,926 --> 00:44:04,843
- Stop pulling.
- I'm not, you're pulling!

683
00:44:04,844 --> 00:44:07,387
If I was pulling,
you would know it!

684
00:44:07,388 --> 00:44:08,972
Why does everything you do

685
00:44:08,973 --> 00:44:10,265
always end up hurting me?

686
00:44:10,266 --> 00:44:11,642
Hurt you?

687
00:44:11,643 --> 00:44:14,561
All I ever did was
try to help you.

688
00:44:14,562 --> 00:44:16,355
You sure? 'Cause every
time you're around,

689
00:44:16,356 --> 00:44:17,648
it ends up with me in pain.

690
00:44:17,649 --> 00:44:20,360
Odie! These ropes are
not funny anymore!

691
00:44:21,527 --> 00:44:25,072
Maybe, if you were a little
more open to seeing me,

692
00:44:25,073 --> 00:44:26,740
things might be
better between us.

693
00:44:26,741 --> 00:44:29,785
You do remember you were the one
who left me in an alley, right?

694
00:44:29,786 --> 00:44:31,787
You don't know what
you're talkin' about.

695
00:44:31,788 --> 00:44:33,998
Then please, enlighten me.

696
00:44:36,834 --> 00:44:38,502
This is about to get real.

697
00:44:38,503 --> 00:44:40,087
That's right. You're
normally never around

698
00:44:40,088 --> 00:44:41,463
to actually defend yourself.

699
00:44:41,464 --> 00:44:43,674
No back door to slink
out of this time.

700
00:44:43,675 --> 00:44:46,009
First, you abandon me,
then years later,

701
00:44:46,010 --> 00:44:48,095
you pull me into
a life of crime.

702
00:44:48,096 --> 00:44:51,139
Well, classic Father of
the Year stuff, Dad.

703
00:44:51,140 --> 00:44:52,516
You know, why would I ever think

704
00:44:52,517 --> 00:44:54,142
that seeing you
could be anything

705
00:44:54,143 --> 00:44:55,394
other than a train wreck?

706
00:44:55,395 --> 00:44:58,313
I did not leave
you in that alley!

707
00:44:58,314 --> 00:44:59,439
You did!

708
00:44:59,440 --> 00:45:01,358
You told me you'd come
right back. You never did!

709
00:45:01,359 --> 00:45:05,153
No. That is not what happened.

710
00:45:05,154 --> 00:45:08,156
Please! You were probably
on the run from someone

711
00:45:08,157 --> 00:45:10,785
- like Jinx and I was in the way.
- No.

712
00:45:12,245 --> 00:45:15,164
No, that night...

713
00:45:17,125 --> 00:45:18,459
That night was different.

714
00:45:43,693 --> 00:45:45,737
Hey! Shoo, shoo!
Get outta here!

715
00:46:21,272 --> 00:46:23,608
Wait here, Junior.
I'll be right back.

716
00:46:29,781 --> 00:46:31,031
Hey, get outta here.

717
00:46:31,032 --> 00:46:33,867
Hey, how you doing? Yeah.
I had to shoo a cat.

718
00:46:33,868 --> 00:46:36,578
Yeah, yeah, diggin'
in the trash. Yeah.

719
00:46:36,579 --> 00:46:38,080
So, what'cha up to now, huh?

720
00:46:38,081 --> 00:46:40,999
Still takin' it easy?
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

721
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:47,000
Oh, no, you're kiddin'.
Really? Yeah, yeah.

722
00:46:47,006 --> 00:46:49,592
It's been raining here for
a while now. Yeah, yeah.

723
00:46:50,635 --> 00:46:53,012
Yeah! I'll see you then.
Okay, bye.

724
00:48:38,576 --> 00:48:39,702
I never knew.

725
00:48:40,620 --> 00:48:41,788
I know, how could you?

726
00:48:42,997 --> 00:48:44,541
Why didn't you
ever come visit me?

727
00:48:45,458 --> 00:48:49,671
I did.
Million times I...

728
00:48:50,755 --> 00:48:52,673
came to knock on your door

729
00:48:52,674 --> 00:48:55,425
and I'd see what a great
life you had with Jon.

730
00:48:55,426 --> 00:48:56,719
So, I just...

731
00:48:57,887 --> 00:48:59,931
thought it was better
if I kept my distance.

732
00:49:00,848 --> 00:49:03,725
I sense a positive breakthrough
in your relationship.

733
00:49:03,726 --> 00:49:05,436
Am I wrong?

734
00:49:06,479 --> 00:49:09,565
Good. After an
extensive evaluation,

735
00:49:09,566 --> 00:49:11,358
I have concluded
that you two are,

736
00:49:11,359 --> 00:49:13,318
in fact,
ready to move forward

737
00:49:13,319 --> 00:49:14,945
- with this mission.
- We are?

738
00:49:14,946 --> 00:49:18,240
- How is that even possible?
- Mathematically, it isn't.

739
00:49:18,241 --> 00:49:20,742
But given your present
levels of incompetence

740
00:49:20,743 --> 00:49:23,203
and overall lack
of basic skills,

741
00:49:23,204 --> 00:49:26,290
I have determined
it would take roughly...

742
00:49:26,291 --> 00:49:29,543
seventeen years to get you both
properly ready for this job.

743
00:49:29,544 --> 00:49:31,170
And since we have...

744
00:49:31,921 --> 00:49:34,716
less than 48 hours,
you've passed.

745
00:49:35,967 --> 00:49:36,968
Congratulations.

746
00:50:21,888 --> 00:50:23,097
She's really losin' it.

747
00:50:26,309 --> 00:50:27,893
Yes, what is it?

748
00:50:27,894 --> 00:50:29,771
They're ready to rob the dairy.

749
00:50:30,939 --> 00:50:32,357
Perfect.

750
00:50:33,066 --> 00:50:36,611
Everything is going to plan.
Now, it's time to make a call.

751
00:50:38,655 --> 00:50:41,240
Excuse me, you keep that
thing in your folds?

752
00:50:41,241 --> 00:50:44,535
That is so disgusting.
You. You dial the number

753
00:50:44,536 --> 00:50:45,703
and put me on speaker!

754
00:50:48,498 --> 00:50:49,498
Hello?

755
00:50:49,499 --> 00:50:51,917
- Hello? Lactose Farms?
- How may I help you?

756
00:50:51,918 --> 00:50:53,585
It's come to my attention

757
00:50:53,586 --> 00:50:55,128
that there'll be
an attempt to rob

758
00:50:55,129 --> 00:50:57,589
one of your dairy
trucks tomorrow.

759
00:50:57,590 --> 00:51:00,509
It's not important who I am
or how I came to know this.

760
00:51:00,510 --> 00:51:03,387
Just think of me as
a concerned citizen

761
00:51:03,388 --> 00:51:04,805
intent on fulfilling my

762
00:51:04,806 --> 00:51:06,974
civic responsibility
as well as...

763
00:51:12,772 --> 00:51:13,773
Chief?

764
00:51:17,110 --> 00:51:21,030
- We may have a situation.
- Well, okay then.

765
00:51:21,739 --> 00:51:23,491
Let's go have a look-see.

766
00:51:28,037 --> 00:51:29,872
This is the third
time they've called.

767
00:51:29,873 --> 00:51:32,666
It just sounds like some
cat prank callin' us.

768
00:51:32,667 --> 00:51:35,335
If it were a dog barking,

769
00:51:35,336 --> 00:51:37,212
I'd be on board for a prank.

770
00:51:37,213 --> 00:51:39,591
Them dogs are born for
mischief, they just are.

771
00:51:40,341 --> 00:51:43,260
Not cats. Oh, no.

772
00:51:43,261 --> 00:51:46,014
Cats mean business.

773
00:51:55,064 --> 00:51:56,648
I repeat, there
will be an attempt

774
00:51:56,649 --> 00:51:58,650
to make off with one of
your milk trucks tomorrow.

775
00:51:58,651 --> 00:52:00,736
I suggest you take
appropriate measures

776
00:52:00,737 --> 00:52:03,322
to prevent this brazen
thievery from occurring.

777
00:52:03,323 --> 00:52:05,449
Okay, I'm done.
Hang up the phone.

778
00:52:05,450 --> 00:52:07,952
Ha, ha. What an
evil genius I am.

779
00:52:09,078 --> 00:52:11,538
Well, then, still seem
like a prank to ya?

780
00:52:11,539 --> 00:52:15,000
- That last part did a little.
- What's our next move, Chief?

781
00:52:15,001 --> 00:52:18,545
Our next move is for me
to go back to my office

782
00:52:18,546 --> 00:52:20,757
and formulate an ingenious plan.

783
00:52:22,550 --> 00:52:24,219
And you go get my car waxed.

784
00:52:26,137 --> 00:52:27,471
Well, well, well,

785
00:52:27,472 --> 00:52:30,015
would you look at that,
Margie Malone?

786
00:52:30,016 --> 00:52:32,435
We're having company tomorrow.

787
00:52:33,394 --> 00:52:36,146
I guess I better take
out my finest china

788
00:52:36,147 --> 00:52:40,902
to serve a heapin' plate
of justice.

789
00:52:48,868 --> 00:52:50,118
What are those for?

790
00:52:50,119 --> 00:52:53,205
For us to communicate
once you're inside...

791
00:52:53,206 --> 00:52:55,583
the belly of the beast.

792
00:52:57,544 --> 00:53:00,964
Okay. Don't we need something
more like radio headsets?

793
00:53:01,714 --> 00:53:04,716
Indoor cat. These are better.

794
00:53:04,717 --> 00:53:06,426
It just feels like
Bluetooth would be better.

795
00:53:06,427 --> 00:53:07,678
These are better than Bluetooth.

796
00:53:07,679 --> 00:53:09,680
These are better than Bluetooth?

797
00:53:09,681 --> 00:53:11,098
They're equal.

798
00:53:11,099 --> 00:53:13,851
And I don't have to
pay for the brand.

799
00:53:19,357 --> 00:53:21,734
Gold Eagle to Chipmunk.
Do you copy?

800
00:53:23,486 --> 00:53:24,778
Of course, you can hear him.

801
00:53:24,779 --> 00:53:26,364
He's standing three
feet away from you.

802
00:53:27,824 --> 00:53:29,700
I see you sprung
for the binoculars.

803
00:53:29,701 --> 00:53:32,453
Now, we just need to find...

804
00:53:34,622 --> 00:53:35,999
a way in.

805
00:53:36,499 --> 00:53:37,708
Anyone ever told
you that you take

806
00:53:37,709 --> 00:53:39,377
a lot of dramatic
pauses when you speak?

807
00:53:42,797 --> 00:53:43,798
Yes.

808
00:53:48,428 --> 00:53:49,429
Hey, wait up!

809
00:53:50,138 --> 00:53:53,057
- Look at that!
- Bingo.

810
00:53:54,517 --> 00:53:57,769
Hello, everyone! And
welcome to the one

811
00:53:57,770 --> 00:54:00,440
and only Lactose Farms!

812
00:54:00,648 --> 00:54:02,691
If you will all
gather around me,

813
00:54:02,692 --> 00:54:04,067
we'll begin our tour

814
00:54:04,068 --> 00:54:05,861
and head into the
heart of the farm.

815
00:54:05,862 --> 00:54:08,322
I know you're here.

816
00:54:08,323 --> 00:54:12,410
I can feel it. Show yourself.

817
00:54:13,661 --> 00:54:15,787
Today you will
discover the answers

818
00:54:15,788 --> 00:54:17,289
to all of your dairy questions,

819
00:54:17,290 --> 00:54:20,500
including the most asked
dairy question of all time,

820
00:54:20,501 --> 00:54:22,420
are curds the whey?

821
00:54:23,338 --> 00:54:26,131
Bullfrog, Chipmunk,
Roadkill, do you copy?

822
00:54:26,132 --> 00:54:28,425
Are you kidding me?
They actually work?

823
00:54:28,426 --> 00:54:29,801
You should take
this to Shark Tank.

824
00:54:29,802 --> 00:54:32,304
Now, remember, the only
way to get the keys

825
00:54:32,305 --> 00:54:35,015
to the milk truck and
free Ethel undetected

826
00:54:35,016 --> 00:54:37,601
is by sticking to the
path I mapped out for you.

827
00:54:37,602 --> 00:54:41,730
If you deviate from that path,
you will trigger security

828
00:54:41,731 --> 00:54:43,941
and all bets are off.
Understood?

829
00:54:43,942 --> 00:54:45,817
All right, look alive.

830
00:54:45,818 --> 00:54:47,319
The electrical access door

831
00:54:47,320 --> 00:54:49,071
should be coming up
on your left.

832
00:54:49,072 --> 00:54:50,448
Okay, this way!

833
00:54:51,658 --> 00:54:53,409
Hey, hey, look!
There it is!

834
00:54:57,747 --> 00:54:59,164
Okay, we're in.

835
00:54:59,165 --> 00:55:01,208
Continue through and
locate the air vent

836
00:55:01,209 --> 00:55:02,502
at the end of the hallway.

837
00:55:03,336 --> 00:55:05,712
That will take you to
the refrigeration room.

838
00:55:05,713 --> 00:55:09,634
Factory workers, your
15-minute break begins now.

839
00:55:22,480 --> 00:55:24,148
Your feet need a deep rinse.

840
00:55:30,780 --> 00:55:33,323
- What's the hold up, Junior?
- How do you get through this?

841
00:55:33,324 --> 00:55:36,201
- You're bigger than me.
- Am I?

842
00:55:36,202 --> 00:55:38,954
- Yes!
- Well, the vent doesn't agree.

843
00:55:38,955 --> 00:55:41,373
- Try sucking in your gut.
- I am.

844
00:55:41,374 --> 00:55:42,876
Try sucking in your
butt and your gut.

845
00:56:09,611 --> 00:56:11,821
Bullfrog, what's happening now?

846
00:56:13,489 --> 00:56:17,034
We fell out of a vent...
into a room that looks like

847
00:56:17,035 --> 00:56:20,205
- it's full of heavy machinery.
- Son of a cud.

848
00:56:22,123 --> 00:56:23,583
You're in the pinecone.

849
00:56:27,086 --> 00:56:30,464
Jiminy Davis!
The perp is a cat!

850
00:56:30,465 --> 00:56:32,665
And this one looks like
it could eat us out of business.

851
00:56:33,343 --> 00:56:35,636
Vic, Vic! Look, there's
the loading dock.

852
00:56:35,637 --> 00:56:38,347
- No! Junior! Don't move.
- What? Why?

853
00:56:38,348 --> 00:56:40,724
We're in the middle
of the pinecone!

854
00:56:40,725 --> 00:56:43,018
Otto told us to stay
out of the pinecone.

855
00:56:43,019 --> 00:56:46,313
Stop. There's no pinecone.
Otto's a bit of a worrywart.

856
00:56:46,314 --> 00:56:48,066
I can walk to the
loading dock from here.

857
00:56:48,900 --> 00:56:49,901
No...

858
00:56:50,568 --> 00:56:51,653
Junior!

859
00:56:58,451 --> 00:56:59,451
Cheddar.

860
00:56:59,452 --> 00:57:01,704
Probably one of my top
26 favorite cheeses.

861
00:57:03,623 --> 00:57:05,543
What do you think happens
when that gets to zero?

862
00:57:09,462 --> 00:57:10,712
Bullfrog, what's happening now?

863
00:57:10,713 --> 00:57:13,507
Roadkill got carried
away into the pinecone!

864
00:57:13,508 --> 00:57:15,551
Listen to me.
You have to carry on

865
00:57:15,552 --> 00:57:17,135
with the mission.
Get to the loading dock

866
00:57:17,136 --> 00:57:18,971
before the workers
return from their break

867
00:57:18,972 --> 00:57:20,932
or you'll miss your only
chance to get that truck.

868
00:57:25,186 --> 00:57:27,897
No, no, no. No, no, no!

869
00:57:29,899 --> 00:57:31,901
Shred sequence initiated.

870
00:57:40,618 --> 00:57:42,661
Odie! Thanks, buddy,

871
00:57:42,662 --> 00:57:44,913
but I'm pretty full
from the cheddar.

872
00:57:44,914 --> 00:57:46,373
Jump off.

873
00:57:46,374 --> 00:57:47,834
Yeah, yeah, good idea.

874
00:57:56,843 --> 00:57:58,595
Good. He's safe.

875
00:58:01,890 --> 00:58:03,850
Hang on.
Wait. Where am I going?

876
00:58:04,934 --> 00:58:08,730
Fondue. Fondue!

877
00:58:49,604 --> 00:58:50,605
Junior.

878
00:58:55,026 --> 00:58:58,988
Hot, hot, hot! Hot!

879
00:59:00,990 --> 00:59:02,367
Junior!

880
00:59:10,750 --> 00:59:12,460
That was too close even for me.

881
00:59:15,421 --> 00:59:16,630
Thanks.

882
00:59:16,631 --> 00:59:18,924
I couldn't let you
have all the fun.

883
00:59:18,925 --> 00:59:20,092
- Workers...
- What?

884
00:59:20,093 --> 00:59:22,095
Your break ends in five minutes.

885
00:59:24,180 --> 00:59:26,265
Okay, Otto, we're
in the loading dock.

886
00:59:26,266 --> 00:59:27,599
Where are the keys?

887
00:59:27,600 --> 00:59:30,270
They should be hanging on
a pegboard on the far wall.

888
00:59:31,688 --> 00:59:33,048
What do you mean
we have a problem?

889
00:59:34,065 --> 00:59:35,900
- Pegboard's empty!
- Empty?

890
00:59:36,609 --> 00:59:39,403
Now would you look at this?

891
00:59:39,404 --> 00:59:43,782
Three misguided stray pets
trying to steal a truck o' milk.

892
00:59:43,783 --> 00:59:47,120
Never a dull moment at this
dairy, is there, Margie?

893
00:59:47,954 --> 00:59:49,746
Well, you're looking
for these, aren't ya?

894
00:59:49,747 --> 00:59:51,416
Well, here you go then.

895
00:59:55,879 --> 00:59:57,963
So, how's this gonna
play out, fellas?

896
00:59:57,964 --> 01:00:00,382
The easy way or the hard way?

897
01:00:00,383 --> 01:00:03,094
And just so you know,
I'm up for either.

898
01:00:05,388 --> 01:00:07,724
- Follow my lead.
- What?

899
01:00:16,274 --> 01:00:17,317
Who's next then?

900
01:00:18,818 --> 01:00:20,819
Otto, a security guard
has the truck keys!

901
01:00:20,820 --> 01:00:23,155
Crazy eyes? Tragic
sense of fashion?

902
01:00:23,156 --> 01:00:24,323
Yeah. How did you know?

903
01:00:24,324 --> 01:00:25,533
Marge Malone.

904
01:00:26,284 --> 01:00:28,577
- Ethel!
- Otto!

905
01:00:28,578 --> 01:00:30,537
She's not just my nemesis,

906
01:00:30,538 --> 01:00:32,664
she's also my enemy.

907
01:00:32,665 --> 01:00:33,999
Love to hear about it,
but right now,

908
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:35,709
- what do we do?
- Get those keys.

909
01:00:35,710 --> 01:00:37,837
I'll create a distraction
so you can get out of there.

910
01:00:39,380 --> 01:00:40,590
Come here, you!

911
01:00:50,266 --> 01:00:52,227
Did you see that?
That's indoor cat style!

912
01:01:01,778 --> 01:01:02,819
No, no, no.

913
01:01:02,820 --> 01:01:05,113
You're not getting away. I've
already called the pound.

914
01:01:05,114 --> 01:01:07,867
Your days of thievery end today.

915
01:01:08,618 --> 01:01:10,620
Attempted perimeter breach.

916
01:01:12,080 --> 01:01:17,042
Attempted perimeter breach.

917
01:01:17,043 --> 01:01:18,335
Otto.

918
01:01:18,336 --> 01:01:22,882
Attempted perimeter breach.
Attempted perimeter breach.

919
01:01:23,841 --> 01:01:27,679
- Junior, sorry about this.
- Sorry? For what?

920
01:01:31,766 --> 01:01:32,767
Vic?

921
01:01:40,692 --> 01:01:42,360
What are you doing?

922
01:01:45,029 --> 01:01:47,489
Vic! Don't you go.

923
01:01:47,490 --> 01:01:48,741
Vic!

924
01:01:50,243 --> 01:01:51,536
Please!

925
01:01:56,749 --> 01:01:59,210
Send security to
the loading dock.

926
01:02:09,387 --> 01:02:10,555
Otto!

927
01:02:13,308 --> 01:02:16,644
You do not want to
try me today, mister.

928
01:02:28,323 --> 01:02:29,741
Get him!

929
01:03:08,655 --> 01:03:13,493
Welcome back... Victor.

930
01:03:17,830 --> 01:03:19,249
Hey, Jinx.

931
01:03:19,958 --> 01:03:22,501
Why are you here? I was
bringing this to you.

932
01:03:22,502 --> 01:03:25,629
Were you? Really?

933
01:03:25,630 --> 01:03:28,591
Yeah, of course I was. That's
what we agreed to, right?

934
01:03:32,512 --> 01:03:37,432
- So, you and me square now?
- Not quite.

935
01:03:37,433 --> 01:03:40,102
There's still the matter
of those five years

936
01:03:40,103 --> 01:03:41,478
I lost because of you.

937
01:03:41,479 --> 01:03:44,274
What? But I thought
this settled that.

938
01:03:46,693 --> 01:03:50,487
It was never about the milk.
It was about you getting caught

939
01:03:50,488 --> 01:03:53,740
trying to steal it and
being sent to the pound

940
01:03:53,741 --> 01:03:55,660
like I was.

941
01:03:56,452 --> 01:03:59,830
You see, Vic,
I needed you to suffer

942
01:03:59,831 --> 01:04:03,251
like I did.

943
01:04:05,128 --> 01:04:06,628
I see.

944
01:04:06,629 --> 01:04:08,255
And I'm guessing
you have an idea

945
01:04:08,256 --> 01:04:10,216
about how that should happen.

946
01:04:10,717 --> 01:04:14,095
As a matter of fact, I do.

947
01:04:21,185 --> 01:04:23,021
I can't believe he did that.

948
01:04:23,771 --> 01:04:28,943
He ran out, and
he left me. Again.

949
01:04:30,153 --> 01:04:31,696
I thought he'd changed,
but it was...

950
01:04:32,822 --> 01:04:34,073
it was a lie.

951
01:04:35,033 --> 01:04:36,117
All of it.

952
01:04:41,206 --> 01:04:43,124
How could I have been so stupid?

953
01:04:48,296 --> 01:04:51,925
Come on, kid.
Don't beat yourself up.

954
01:04:52,800 --> 01:04:55,802
Vic, man, we've all
been burned by Vic.

955
01:04:55,803 --> 01:04:58,264
Yeah, that's right.
Burned every cat I know.

956
01:04:59,807 --> 01:05:02,559
Yeah, the one thing about
Vic you can count on

957
01:05:02,560 --> 01:05:05,395
- is that you can't count on him.
- Tell me about it.

958
01:05:05,396 --> 01:05:07,522
- Yeah.
- Yeah, I'll tell you about it.

959
01:05:07,523 --> 01:05:11,026
Long story short, we all
used to run in a pack

960
01:05:11,027 --> 01:05:13,488
until we had to kick
him out the crew.

961
01:05:14,572 --> 01:05:17,115
Like I said, couldn't
count on him.

962
01:05:17,116 --> 01:05:18,450
Sounds about right.

963
01:05:18,451 --> 01:05:20,285
He'd leave in the
middle of a job

964
01:05:20,286 --> 01:05:21,829
just to go see his kid.

965
01:05:22,455 --> 01:05:25,249
Yeah, he said he wanted
to check up on him.

966
01:05:25,250 --> 01:05:27,251
Make sure he was doing okay.

967
01:05:27,252 --> 01:05:30,045
But get this,
he'd never actually visit.

968
01:05:30,046 --> 01:05:31,588
He'd just sit across the street

969
01:05:31,589 --> 01:05:33,966
from his kid's house
in a giant oak tree.

970
01:05:33,967 --> 01:05:36,510
- That never happened.
- He'd watch that kid eat...

971
01:05:36,511 --> 01:05:37,928
- and eat and eat...
- and eat...

972
01:05:37,929 --> 01:05:41,098
- He put a notch in the bark...
- and eat, and eat, and eat.

973
01:05:41,099 --> 01:05:43,850
- Every time he was there.
- Yeah. Sure, he did.

974
01:05:43,851 --> 01:05:47,521
He'd go every Sunday night,
rain or shine.

975
01:05:47,522 --> 01:05:49,064
Said that it was his kid's...

976
01:05:49,065 --> 01:05:51,734
family dinner night.

977
01:05:56,781 --> 01:05:58,616
Okay, hate to tell you guys...

978
01:05:59,659 --> 01:06:02,619
I guarantee that never happened.
Okay?

979
01:06:02,620 --> 01:06:05,957
You all fell for another one
of Vic's lies. We all have.

980
01:06:06,791 --> 01:06:08,751
Because that's
what he does best.

981
01:06:13,923 --> 01:06:15,883
Odie? Odie!
How did you get out?

982
01:06:15,884 --> 01:06:19,511
- Quick, pick the lock on my cage.
- Garfield, there you are!

983
01:06:19,512 --> 01:06:22,139
Jon!
Take me away from all this.

984
01:06:22,140 --> 01:06:24,349
You can't imagine what
I've been through.

985
01:06:24,350 --> 01:06:26,351
- You want this one too?
- Yes, I do.

986
01:06:26,352 --> 01:06:27,644
- I was hung upside down.
- You sure he's yours?

987
01:06:27,645 --> 01:06:29,104
He didn't have a tag.

988
01:06:29,105 --> 01:06:30,940
- I jumped a train.
- Yeah. He has a tag.

989
01:06:31,733 --> 01:06:34,818
I have a collar and a tag?
How long have I had those?

990
01:06:34,819 --> 01:06:36,778
Okay. I'm just gonna
need you to hold.

991
01:06:36,779 --> 01:06:39,489
I will not hold!
I am done holding!

992
01:06:39,490 --> 01:06:43,286
The Jon who was on hold is dead.
Do you understand?

993
01:06:45,079 --> 01:06:48,208
That's right.
I'm back, baby!

994
01:06:50,710 --> 01:06:53,046
I was just talking
about you, wasn't I?

995
01:06:56,507 --> 01:06:57,634
I've missed you too.

996
01:07:06,601 --> 01:07:08,102
Pooky!

997
01:07:10,855 --> 01:07:13,358
I have a lot to tell you.
You're never gonna believe it.

998
01:07:14,192 --> 01:07:16,735
Crazy stuff happened.
I slept outside, twice!

999
01:07:16,736 --> 01:07:17,946
I know. Me.

1000
01:07:18,529 --> 01:07:20,323
And I got you this
commemorative pin.

1001
01:07:21,324 --> 01:07:22,866
Dinner time!

1002
01:07:22,867 --> 01:07:23,952
Talk later.

1003
01:07:41,844 --> 01:07:43,220
Say when.

1004
01:07:43,221 --> 01:07:45,932
Never, Jon. Bury me in cheese.

1005
01:07:48,643 --> 01:07:52,062
I have two more in the freezer.
Let me know when you want 'em.

1006
01:07:52,063 --> 01:07:53,314
I'm gonna go check on dessert.

1007
01:07:54,399 --> 01:07:56,400
I apologize in advance.

1008
01:07:56,401 --> 01:07:58,986
The eating you're about
to see will not be pretty

1009
01:07:58,987 --> 01:08:00,487
and if you have young children,

1010
01:08:00,488 --> 01:08:02,568
this would be a good time
for them to leave the room.

1011
01:08:15,920 --> 01:08:18,297
He'd just sit across the
street from his kid's house

1012
01:08:18,298 --> 01:08:19,840
in a giant oak tree.

1013
01:08:41,362 --> 01:08:44,032
I know, I know.
We're coming back.

1014
01:08:45,491 --> 01:08:47,242
I just need to check
something out first.

1015
01:09:08,598 --> 01:09:10,183
He put a notch in the bark...

1016
01:09:12,018 --> 01:09:13,644
every time he was there.

1017
01:09:30,827 --> 01:09:32,621
He left a notch.

1018
01:09:35,208 --> 01:09:36,376
Yeah, right.

1019
01:10:18,751 --> 01:10:19,794
He was here.

1020
01:10:20,920 --> 01:10:22,046
He saw me grow up.

1021
01:10:26,634 --> 01:10:27,843
Wow, that really stings.

1022
01:10:27,844 --> 01:10:29,970
I don't know why
I didn't think it would.

1023
01:10:29,971 --> 01:10:31,306
Give me a second.

1024
01:10:33,266 --> 01:10:34,349
Vic loves us!

1025
01:10:34,350 --> 01:10:36,768
Me first, of course,
but then you too!

1026
01:10:36,769 --> 01:10:42,769
But me, a lot, and first!
Wait, but if he loves me, us,

1027
01:10:42,775 --> 01:10:45,944
why would he let me, us,
get captured at the dairy?

1028
01:10:45,945 --> 01:10:48,322
Unless, he wanted

1029
01:10:48,323 --> 01:10:49,781
- us to get captured!
- Hey!

1030
01:10:49,782 --> 01:10:50,866
- Yes!
- Hey, watch it!

1031
01:10:50,867 --> 01:10:53,368
He knew that Jinx wasn't
gonna let him off the hook.

1032
01:10:53,369 --> 01:10:56,121
But if we got caught,
we'd get sent to the pound

1033
01:10:56,122 --> 01:10:59,124
and Jon would come to get us!
Don't you see, Odie?

1034
01:10:59,125 --> 01:11:01,753
- He was trying to save us!
- Losers!

1035
01:11:03,421 --> 01:11:05,089
We have to go save my dad.

1036
01:11:05,798 --> 01:11:08,842
And here's your
favorite dessert,

1037
01:11:08,843 --> 01:11:11,512
Mount Candy-toa!

1038
01:11:12,764 --> 01:11:13,806
Guys?

1039
01:11:18,895 --> 01:11:20,230
Come on!

1040
01:11:28,738 --> 01:11:31,032
What is this?

1041
01:11:45,630 --> 01:11:47,632
Half a star for Mamma Leoni's?

1042
01:11:48,925 --> 01:11:50,134
She's a monster.

1043
01:11:52,679 --> 01:11:53,972
She's gonna tie him up...

1044
01:11:54,472 --> 01:11:55,932
take him on a train...

1045
01:11:56,766 --> 01:11:59,351
She's going to throw him
off the Mile High Bridge!

1046
01:11:59,352 --> 01:12:01,688
We're gonna need help.
Who can we call?

1047
01:12:05,984 --> 01:12:07,150
You've got a lot
of waxy buildup.

1048
01:12:07,151 --> 01:12:08,444
What's your Q-tip routine?

1049
01:12:09,404 --> 01:12:10,404
You're right, you're right.

1050
01:12:10,405 --> 01:12:12,489
We can deal with
that situation later.

1051
01:12:12,490 --> 01:12:15,368
Hello? Hello?
Is anyone there? Hello?

1052
01:12:19,163 --> 01:12:20,289
Get off the line.

1053
01:12:20,290 --> 01:12:22,249
This acorn is for
emergency use only.

1054
01:12:22,250 --> 01:12:25,169
Otto! Otto, please, listen.

1055
01:12:25,295 --> 01:12:27,379
I wanna make good on
our original deal,

1056
01:12:27,380 --> 01:12:30,383
but I need a favor first.

1057
01:12:34,512 --> 01:12:37,515
Otto, are you still there or
are you taking a dramatic pause?

1058
01:12:40,602 --> 01:12:41,603
I'm listening.

1059
01:12:47,233 --> 01:12:48,650
You know, Vic,

1060
01:12:48,651 --> 01:12:52,322
you only have yourself
to blame for this.

1061
01:12:54,032 --> 01:12:56,158
Right. Look,

1062
01:12:56,159 --> 01:12:58,827
there's got to be some way
for me to make this right.

1063
01:12:58,828 --> 01:13:00,954
I mean, I know we can
think of somethin'.

1064
01:13:00,955 --> 01:13:04,709
There is, and you will.

1065
01:13:17,931 --> 01:13:19,097
So, once I get on the train...

1066
01:13:19,098 --> 01:13:20,682
I untie Vic and we jump off

1067
01:13:20,683 --> 01:13:22,226
right as the train
gets to the bridge.

1068
01:13:22,227 --> 01:13:24,354
Correct. Chipmunk will
be waiting for you.

1069
01:13:26,356 --> 01:13:27,732
Confirm your status, Chipmunk.

1070
01:13:29,734 --> 01:13:31,944
If you don't jump right as
the train gets to the bridge,

1071
01:13:31,945 --> 01:13:33,112
you'll miss the net.

1072
01:13:34,030 --> 01:13:36,281
Got it. It's getting close.

1073
01:13:36,282 --> 01:13:38,450
Have you considered throwing
a rope over a branch

1074
01:13:38,451 --> 01:13:40,494
and just swinging onto
the passing train instead?

1075
01:13:40,495 --> 01:13:41,578
You watch too much TV.

1076
01:13:41,579 --> 01:13:42,704
I've never watched TV.

1077
01:13:42,705 --> 01:13:45,082
Well, this way is much
better than your rope idea.

1078
01:13:45,083 --> 01:13:46,667
Better than the versatile,
reliable rope?

1079
01:13:46,668 --> 01:13:48,961
Look, I've studied the science.
I know what I'm doing.

1080
01:13:48,962 --> 01:13:51,380
And you think you can battle
these villains on your own?

1081
01:13:51,381 --> 01:13:54,259
Oh yeah. I have a plan.
Odie?

1082
01:13:54,801 --> 01:13:55,802
Make the order.

1083
01:13:58,805 --> 01:14:00,430
Now get ready to fling me

1084
01:14:00,431 --> 01:14:02,559
in the direction of
that moving train.

1085
01:14:08,314 --> 01:14:09,482
Get ready.

1086
01:14:11,401 --> 01:14:13,278
If I don't make it back...

1087
01:14:13,903 --> 01:14:15,989
tell my story. Now!

1088
01:14:17,991 --> 01:14:19,741
Roadkill! You're too high!
You're gonna miss it!

1089
01:14:19,742 --> 01:14:21,535
No, no, this is how you do it!

1090
01:14:21,536 --> 01:14:23,079
It's called the
ricochet approach!

1091
01:14:28,209 --> 01:14:29,502
It won't be long now.

1092
01:14:29,627 --> 01:14:31,795
I can't tell you
how excited I am

1093
01:14:31,796 --> 01:14:33,423
for what's about to happen next.

1094
01:14:35,842 --> 01:14:38,260
Dad! I'm here to rescue you!

1095
01:14:38,261 --> 01:14:39,344
No, no, no, Junior!

1096
01:14:39,345 --> 01:14:40,762
- Get outta here!
- I'm gonna untie you,

1097
01:14:40,763 --> 01:14:41,930
and we're gonna
jump off the train!

1098
01:14:41,931 --> 01:14:43,724
- No! Just leave me and go!
- I didn't come this far...

1099
01:14:43,725 --> 01:14:45,517
just to turn around,
let me untie you!

1100
01:14:45,518 --> 01:14:47,645
You're ruining everything!

1101
01:14:48,813 --> 01:14:49,814
Quick, this way!

1102
01:14:59,532 --> 01:15:01,659
You half-wit! Get them!

1103
01:15:32,190 --> 01:15:33,190
The bridge is comin' up!

1104
01:15:33,191 --> 01:15:34,691
We gotta get to the caboose now!

1105
01:15:34,692 --> 01:15:36,694
- What? Why?
- Just follow my lead!

1106
01:15:46,704 --> 01:15:48,121
Oi, kitty cat!

1107
01:15:48,122 --> 01:15:51,208
Did you expect to take
us on all by yourself?

1108
01:15:51,209 --> 01:15:54,587
No. I brought takeout.

1109
01:16:42,719 --> 01:16:44,845
I never understood
the purpose of salad

1110
01:16:44,846 --> 01:16:46,764
until this exact moment!

1111
01:16:54,355 --> 01:16:56,356
Go, go! Now!

1112
01:16:56,357 --> 01:16:57,567
Get after him!

1113
01:17:19,255 --> 01:17:20,756
Yeah, in case you
were wonderin',

1114
01:17:20,757 --> 01:17:22,382
I do my own stunts.

1115
01:17:22,383 --> 01:17:23,468
Me...

1116
01:17:24,594 --> 01:17:25,803
and Tom Cruise.

1117
01:17:29,515 --> 01:17:31,184
Junior!

1118
01:17:37,607 --> 01:17:38,608
Stop him!

1119
01:17:59,128 --> 01:18:00,462
Now that's amazing!

1120
01:18:00,463 --> 01:18:01,838
I can't feel my tongue.

1121
01:18:01,839 --> 01:18:02,923
Roadkill!

1122
01:18:02,924 --> 01:18:04,842
Are you at the caboose,
ready to jump?

1123
01:18:27,574 --> 01:18:28,949
Dad! Dad!

1124
01:18:28,950 --> 01:18:30,952
Jump, Junior! I'll catch you!

1125
01:18:56,686 --> 01:18:58,103
What do we do now?

1126
01:18:58,104 --> 01:18:59,355
We do this!

1127
01:19:03,401 --> 01:19:04,402
See ya, everyone.

1128
01:19:09,490 --> 01:19:11,992
The net's too tight!

1129
01:19:11,993 --> 01:19:13,493
Roadkill, the net is too tight!

1130
01:19:13,494 --> 01:19:14,579
I heard!

1131
01:19:21,502 --> 01:19:23,588
Hello again, welcome back!

1132
01:19:23,922 --> 01:19:25,506
Now, where were we?

1133
01:19:34,933 --> 01:19:36,350
No, no! Don't throw
them over just yet.

1134
01:19:36,351 --> 01:19:37,477
No!

1135
01:19:37,894 --> 01:19:39,853
I want to find the perfect place

1136
01:19:39,854 --> 01:19:42,357
for them to make
the biggest splat.

1137
01:19:43,024 --> 01:19:45,317
Hey, hey! Junior!
Junior, Junior.

1138
01:19:45,318 --> 01:19:47,570
Get ready! Almost there!

1139
01:19:48,738 --> 01:19:50,823
I'm sorry my rescue
didn't work out.

1140
01:19:50,949 --> 01:19:53,952
No, you gave me another chance.

1141
01:19:54,536 --> 01:19:56,120
That's all that matters.

1142
01:20:00,250 --> 01:20:02,919
Now, now! Drop them now!

1143
01:20:04,629 --> 01:20:06,172
What are you waiting for?

1144
01:20:09,050 --> 01:20:11,134
Their love for one
another indicates that

1145
01:20:11,135 --> 01:20:13,262
despite their
current circumstance,

1146
01:20:13,263 --> 01:20:15,055
they are at peace.

1147
01:20:15,056 --> 01:20:18,267
- Because they are together.
- So?

1148
01:20:18,268 --> 01:20:20,852
If the point of your
revenge was to hurt them,

1149
01:20:20,853 --> 01:20:23,147
it has done the opposite.

1150
01:20:23,273 --> 01:20:24,982
It's actually textbook irony!

1151
01:20:24,983 --> 01:20:28,653
And we're no longer
comfortable with your plan.

1152
01:20:29,320 --> 01:20:31,655
You two are still
as weak as you were

1153
01:20:31,656 --> 01:20:34,158
when I found you
sniveling in the pound.

1154
01:20:34,868 --> 01:20:36,410
No one will adopt us.

1155
01:20:36,411 --> 01:20:38,495
I never grew into my folds.

1156
01:20:38,496 --> 01:20:40,914
I hide behind them because
I'm socially awkward.

1157
01:20:40,915 --> 01:20:42,375
Please, somebody love me

1158
01:20:42,500 --> 01:20:44,376
even though I can't sit still
for more than ten seconds

1159
01:20:44,377 --> 01:20:46,671
and have the attention
span of a bloody goldfish!

1160
01:20:47,213 --> 01:20:50,132
We did everything
you ever asked of us.

1161
01:20:50,133 --> 01:20:52,301
I even spoke with
this ridiculous accent

1162
01:20:52,302 --> 01:20:54,136
to make you feel more at home.

1163
01:20:54,137 --> 01:20:55,429
But no more!

1164
01:20:55,430 --> 01:20:57,723
I'm New York, loud and proud!

1165
01:20:57,724 --> 01:21:00,017
I love myself the way I am

1166
01:21:00,018 --> 01:21:02,896
and I'm a big, brave, boy, baby!

1167
01:21:03,021 --> 01:21:06,190
And I've been working
on my attention span.

1168
01:21:06,316 --> 01:21:07,400
Is that a hot air balloon?

1169
01:21:08,526 --> 01:21:09,694
You two...

1170
01:21:10,111 --> 01:21:11,403
are...

1171
01:21:11,404 --> 01:21:12,739
worthless!

1172
01:21:52,362 --> 01:21:56,073
Might I just say as someone
else with a zaftig figure,

1173
01:21:56,074 --> 01:21:57,742
you have a beautiful body, sir.

1174
01:21:59,452 --> 01:22:00,495
Oh, dear!

1175
01:22:04,457 --> 01:22:07,460
Rope. Versatile. Reliable.

1176
01:22:07,585 --> 01:22:09,044
There's something
about your cadence

1177
01:22:09,045 --> 01:22:10,547
that really throws me,
but thank you.

1178
01:22:25,895 --> 01:22:28,897
Tossing me off the train?
Did not see that coming.

1179
01:22:28,898 --> 01:22:30,482
Well, when you live in the wild,

1180
01:22:30,483 --> 01:22:32,609
you gotta keep your
head on a swivel.

1181
01:22:32,610 --> 01:22:34,195
Right.

1182
01:22:34,904 --> 01:22:38,115
It's basic Outdoor Cat 101.

1183
01:22:38,116 --> 01:22:40,201
And that had bird poop on it.

1184
01:22:40,702 --> 01:22:42,704
Hey. You good, Roadkill?

1185
01:22:44,414 --> 01:22:45,497
Not quite.

1186
01:22:45,498 --> 01:22:48,334
There's one last
thing to take care of.

1187
01:22:48,585 --> 01:22:49,586
Cut to...

1188
01:22:57,302 --> 01:23:00,053
It was a dark and foggy night.

1189
01:23:00,054 --> 01:23:04,766
The air was damp and
heavier than a broken heart.

1190
01:23:04,767 --> 01:23:06,852
On nights like this,
you can't swing a cat

1191
01:23:06,853 --> 01:23:09,229
without hittin' shady characters

1192
01:23:09,230 --> 01:23:12,358
makin' shady deals
all over town.

1193
01:23:15,737 --> 01:23:18,531
But this night was going
to be different.

1194
01:23:18,656 --> 01:23:21,158
Justice was about to be served.

1195
01:23:21,159 --> 01:23:25,746
With a helping of
retribution on the side.

1196
01:23:25,747 --> 01:23:28,415
Is that... the package?

1197
01:23:28,416 --> 01:23:30,417
It is.

1198
01:23:30,418 --> 01:23:31,836
Then we have a deal.

1199
01:23:36,966 --> 01:23:38,884
No one will come
looking for her?

1200
01:23:38,885 --> 01:23:41,178
Nope. I did what you said.

1201
01:23:41,179 --> 01:23:42,888
I burned her paperwork.

1202
01:23:42,889 --> 01:23:45,307
And then shredded it
and burned it some more.

1203
01:23:45,308 --> 01:23:48,061
It's like she never existed.

1204
01:23:48,478 --> 01:23:51,439
Except for the image of her face
on millions of dairy products.

1205
01:24:11,167 --> 01:24:12,167
This...

1206
01:24:12,168 --> 01:24:13,503
never happened.

1207
01:24:14,003 --> 01:24:15,004
Agreed.

1208
01:24:18,591 --> 01:24:20,092
Save it, Cat Fancy.

1209
01:24:20,093 --> 01:24:21,718
I know you planned the
milk truck heist...

1210
01:24:21,719 --> 01:24:23,762
and then tried to throw those
innocent cats off a train

1211
01:24:23,763 --> 01:24:24,846
to cover it up.

1212
01:24:24,847 --> 01:24:26,849
The boys told me everything.

1213
01:24:43,324 --> 01:24:44,409
Otto!

1214
01:24:50,748 --> 01:24:52,458
You are my day.

1215
01:24:53,042 --> 01:24:55,253
You are my night.

1216
01:25:34,167 --> 01:25:36,085
Well, this is us.

1217
01:25:36,753 --> 01:25:38,796
Right. You're home.

1218
01:25:41,799 --> 01:25:44,039
- Hey, listen, I'm sorry.
- I just want to say I'm sorry.

1219
01:25:44,886 --> 01:25:46,471
What are you sorry for?

1220
01:25:49,891 --> 01:25:51,267
For misjudging you.

1221
01:25:53,311 --> 01:25:55,688
Well. Thanks.

1222
01:25:56,397 --> 01:25:58,357
Well, I just wanted to
apologize to you for...

1223
01:25:58,358 --> 01:26:01,693
Everything bad that happened
to us the last three days?

1224
01:26:01,694 --> 01:26:03,862
You know, you had your hand in

1225
01:26:03,863 --> 01:26:06,032
a few bad decisions
back there too, but...

1226
01:26:07,992 --> 01:26:10,495
yeah, I'm sorry for
dragging you into my world.

1227
01:26:11,037 --> 01:26:13,080
This is where you belong,

1228
01:26:13,081 --> 01:26:15,207
here with Jon and...

1229
01:26:15,208 --> 01:26:17,168
What's your name again?
Odor?

1230
01:26:22,048 --> 01:26:25,218
- So, yeah, I should go.
- Yeah, yeah.

1231
01:26:25,343 --> 01:26:26,969
I mean, unless...
you'd want to come in?

1232
01:26:26,970 --> 01:26:28,637
Nah. No, no. I don't
think that would work.

1233
01:26:28,638 --> 01:26:31,516
- You know, I'm an outdoor cat.
- Right. Sure. Sure.

1234
01:26:31,641 --> 01:26:34,142
- No, I just... I figured that...
- No, no, no, I get it.

1235
01:26:34,143 --> 01:26:35,352
But, you know what?

1236
01:26:35,353 --> 01:26:38,730
I got this thing on the other
side of town I gotta go do so...

1237
01:26:38,731 --> 01:26:40,567
No. I'm very busy too. Yeah.

1238
01:26:42,318 --> 01:26:43,361
See you around then?

1239
01:26:44,028 --> 01:26:45,070
You know where to find me.

1240
01:26:45,071 --> 01:26:46,322
In the kitchen.

1241
01:26:50,952 --> 01:26:52,245
Well, take care.

1242
01:26:53,872 --> 01:26:56,875
And remember,
stay out of the pinecone.

1243
01:27:01,337 --> 01:27:04,090
What? You heard him.
It's for the best.

1244
01:27:10,722 --> 01:27:13,140
You're back?
What is going on? Are you okay?

1245
01:27:13,141 --> 01:27:14,474
I was so worried!

1246
01:27:14,475 --> 01:27:16,101
You know, I was gonna add
more locks to the door,

1247
01:27:16,102 --> 01:27:18,186
you know, try to keep you in,
but then I thought, well,

1248
01:27:18,187 --> 01:27:19,980
what if they wanted
to be outdoor pets?

1249
01:27:19,981 --> 01:27:21,774
Do you wanna be free-range?

1250
01:27:23,067 --> 01:27:24,776
I really missed you guys.
And I gotta say...

1251
01:27:24,777 --> 01:27:27,696
it's great to be together again,
the whole entire family.

1252
01:27:27,697 --> 01:27:30,198
You have no idea what the
last few days have been like.

1253
01:27:30,199 --> 01:27:32,451
Phone calls, and hold times
and tears. And more tears.

1254
01:27:32,452 --> 01:27:34,370
Don't give me that,
I asked him to stay.

1255
01:27:35,288 --> 01:27:36,496
He wanted to leave!

1256
01:27:36,497 --> 01:27:38,290
You heard him,
he said he had to...

1257
01:27:38,291 --> 01:27:39,375
Well, I...

1258
01:27:40,543 --> 01:27:42,188
- A family should consist...
- Fine. I'll be right back!

1259
01:27:42,212 --> 01:27:44,172
Wait, wait, what?

1260
01:27:45,131 --> 01:27:47,175
Am I using trigger words
that I'm not aware of?

1261
01:28:19,832 --> 01:28:23,670
So, you coming in or do we have
to bring food up there to you?

1262
01:28:28,675 --> 01:28:30,134
I'll come to you.

1263
01:28:30,260 --> 01:28:32,595
I just need to finish
something up here.

1264
01:28:47,694 --> 01:28:51,573
You know, those notches
show how much you love me.

1265
01:28:51,948 --> 01:28:53,907
Is that what you
think they mean?

1266
01:28:53,908 --> 01:28:55,075
Yeah.

1267
01:28:55,076 --> 01:28:58,788
Nah, I was just counting how
many slices of lasagna you ate.

1268
01:29:04,085 --> 01:29:05,794
My medium is cuisine...

1269
01:29:05,795 --> 01:29:09,173
my colors are flavors...

1270
01:29:10,133 --> 01:29:13,177
my palette is my palate...
if you will.

1271
01:29:21,227 --> 01:29:22,812
Dinner is served!

1272
01:29:27,984 --> 01:29:30,611
Wow, son, I didn't know
you could cook.

1273
01:29:30,612 --> 01:29:33,113
Yes, pasta is my paint, and...

1274
01:29:33,114 --> 01:29:36,075
the dinner plate my canvas.

1275
01:29:37,327 --> 01:29:38,536
That's where that went.

1276
01:29:47,420 --> 01:29:48,504
I've had worse.

1277
01:29:55,011 --> 01:29:56,512
Thank you, Garfield.

1278
01:30:00,642 --> 01:30:02,935
Is he gonna be coming
around for dinner often?

1279
01:30:02,936 --> 01:30:05,521
Yeah, he's family.

1280
01:30:10,652 --> 01:30:12,569
What?
Why do I have a takeout bill

1281
01:30:12,570 --> 01:30:14,530
for 6,000 drone deliveries?
