The guards won't know what hit it

1426
01:12:13,920 --> 01:12:16,000
We'll swoop right down
and take the crown

1427
01:12:16,080 --> 01:12:17,880
And the Crown Jewels with it

1428
01:12:17,920 --> 01:12:19,680
And when we fly to Paris

1429
01:12:19,760 --> 01:12:22,040
Oh, the treasures I'll be grabbin'

1430
01:12:22,080 --> 01:12:24,240
The Mona Lisa will look lovely

1431
01:12:24,320 --> 01:12:26,240
Hanging in me cabin

1432
01:12:26,360 --> 01:12:27,360
Hey-ho

1433
01:12:27,440 --> 01:12:29,280
Imagine the places that we'll go

1434
01:12:29,360 --> 01:12:31,400
No one can stop us
When we're so

1435
01:12:31,440 --> 01:12:34,520
High in the stratosphere!

1436
01:12:34,600 --> 01:12:35,600
Hey-ho

1437
01:12:35,640 --> 01:12:37,320
We'll be the freighter that plunders

1438
01:12:37,400 --> 01:12:39,360
Every one of the world's
seven wonders

1439
01:12:39,440 --> 01:12:40,720
When we're up in the skies

1440
01:12:40,760 --> 01:12:42,680
For who can fight a frigate that flies?

1441
01:12:42,760 --> 01:12:46,600
No one can fight a frigate that flies

1442
01:12:46,640 --> 01:12:48,720
Next we'll roam to Rome, me lads

1443
01:12:48,800 --> 01:12:50,800
And here's what I'll be stealin'

1444
01:12:50,880 --> 01:12:52,480
I'll rob the Sistine Chapel

1445
01:12:52,560 --> 01:12:54,800
Of the Sistine Chapel's ceilin'

1446
01:12:54,840 --> 01:12:56,800
And for all the folks in Egypt

1447
01:12:56,880 --> 01:12:58,840
It will be a dismal day

1448
01:12:58,920 --> 01:13:00,920
They'll be crying for their mummies

1449
01:13:00,960 --> 01:13:03,240
When we take their mummies away!

1450
01:13:03,280 --> 01:13:04,520
Hey-ho

1451
01:13:04,600 --> 01:13:06,360
Imagine the places that we'll go

1452
01:13:06,440 --> 01:13:08,920
No can stop us when we're so high!

1453
01:13:08,960 --> 01:13:11,480
They will all cower in fear

1454
01:13:11,520 --> 01:13:14,160
Hey-ho, from Delhi to Rio to Venice

1455
01:13:14,200 --> 01:13:16,120
There's no city that we will not menace

1456
01:13:16,160 --> 01:13:17,640
When we're up in the skies

1457
01:13:17,680 --> 01:13:19,640
For who can fight a frigate that flies?

1458
01:13:19,720 --> 01:13:23,640
No one can fight a frigate that flies

1459
01:13:23,680 --> 01:13:27,360
-Oh, how high we will be!
-We will be

1460
01:13:27,440 --> 01:13:31,320
'Cause the blue fairy dust
Surely packs a mighty wallop

1461
01:13:31,360 --> 01:13:32,480
Only takes a dollop

1462
01:13:32,560 --> 01:13:35,600
-Soon it will set us free
-We'll be free

1463
01:13:35,680 --> 01:13:37,840
From the chains of gravity

1464
01:13:37,880 --> 01:13:39,880
Then we'll hoist up the sail

1465
01:13:39,960 --> 01:13:42,000
And we'll set course for the sun

1466
01:13:42,080 --> 01:13:43,840
'Cause when you've got wings

1467
01:13:43,920 --> 01:13:45,960
No wicked deed cannot be done

1468
01:13:46,000 --> 01:13:47,960
And we owe it all

1469
01:13:48,000 --> 01:13:52,160
To our great and glorious captain

1470
01:13:52,920 --> 01:13:54,560
YANG: Two, three, four!

1471
01:13:54,640 --> 01:13:57,520
Hey-ho,
imagine the places that we'll go

1472
01:13:57,600 --> 01:14:00,200
No one can stop us when we're so high

1473
01:14:00,240 --> 01:14:02,720
-Givin' a pirate cheer
-Arr!

1474
01:14:02,800 --> 01:14:05,520
Hey-ho, we'll be
the freighter that plunders

1475
01:14:05,560 --> 01:14:07,520
Every one of the world's
seven wonders

1476
01:14:07,600 --> 01:14:08,800
When we're up in the skies

1477
01:14:08,880 --> 01:14:10,920
For who can fight a frigate that flies?

1478
01:14:11,000 --> 01:14:13,880
Hey-ho, there's not a town or a county

1479
01:14:13,960 --> 01:14:16,560
That will not yield its bounty up

1480
01:14:16,640 --> 01:14:19,080
When our ship draws near

1481
01:14:19,160 --> 01:14:22,040
Hey-ho, there's not a city or village

1482
01:14:22,120 --> 01:14:24,040
That we will not plunder or pillage

1483
01:14:24,120 --> 01:14:25,360
When we're up in the skies

1484
01:14:25,440 --> 01:14:27,400
For who can fight a frigate that flies?

1485
01:14:27,440 --> 01:14:31,520
And every nation will give a donation

1486
01:14:31,560 --> 01:14:34,720
When they see us sail the skies

1487
01:14:34,800 --> 01:14:36,920
In a frigate that flies!

1488
01:14:37,000 --> 01:14:38,320
Hey!
