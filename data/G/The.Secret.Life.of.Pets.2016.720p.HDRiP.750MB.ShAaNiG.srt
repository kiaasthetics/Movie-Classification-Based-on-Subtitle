1
00:01:26,380 --> 00:01:28,468
I've lived in this city
all my life.

2
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:29,885
I'm Max.

3
00:01:29,890 --> 00:01:32,434
And I'm the luckiest dog
in New York,

4
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:34,068
because of her.

5
00:01:34,390 --> 00:01:35,702
That's Katie.

6
00:01:36,102 --> 00:01:37,211
Katie and I...

7
00:01:37,222 --> 00:01:39,200
Well, we have a perfect relationship.

8
00:01:40,070 --> 00:01:42,525
We met a few years ago. And...

9
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:45,222
Boy, let me tell you,
we got along right away.

10
00:01:45,892 --> 00:01:47,932
You know, it was one of those
relationships where...

11
00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:49,702
Where you just know.

12
00:01:51,394 --> 00:01:54,537
And get this. She was
looking for a roommate,

13
00:01:54,548 --> 00:01:55,873
and so was I!

14
00:01:55,874 --> 00:01:58,582
So, I just moved in
that same day!

15
00:01:58,940 --> 00:02:00,471
Was perfect!

16
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:03,120
We've been togather ever since.

17
00:02:05,291 --> 00:02:07,280
Katie would do anything for me.

18
00:02:07,510 --> 00:02:09,725
And I'm her lawyer protector.

19
00:02:15,590 --> 00:02:16,868
Our love is...

20
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:18,320
Our love is, how do I put this?

21
00:02:18,342 --> 00:02:21,310
Our love is stronger than words,

22
00:02:21,536 --> 00:02:23,160
Or shoes.

23
00:02:24,620 --> 00:02:26,217
It's me and Katie.

24
00:02:27,010 --> 00:02:28,605
Kaite and me.

25
00:02:31,531 --> 00:02:33,291
Us against the world.

26
00:02:39,910 --> 00:02:42,181
I wouldn't go so far as
to call us soulmates,

27
00:02:42,182 --> 00:02:45,315
Even though, any sane
person who saw us would.

28
00:03:02,022 --> 00:03:04,360
There's just one little problem.

29
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:07,897
- Pretty much, everyday!
- Come on, Max!

30
00:03:07,908 --> 00:03:09,508
She leaves!

31
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:11,611
I'll see you tonight.

32
00:03:11,622 --> 00:03:14,490
Sometime I try stuff
to get her to stay!

33
00:03:14,580 --> 00:03:17,222
Okay, sit.

34
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:19,428
Spin.

35
00:03:20,468 --> 00:03:21,748
Speak.

36
00:03:22,571 --> 00:03:24,720
Okay, that's a good boy.

37
00:03:24,857 --> 00:03:26,422
But, it never works!

38
00:03:27,588 --> 00:03:29,142
Where is she going?

39
00:03:31,190 --> 00:03:33,314
What could she possibly
be doing?

40
00:03:35,632 --> 00:03:38,502
I miss her so much!

41
00:03:39,897 --> 00:03:42,605
Wow, oh my... oh, she's back!

42
00:03:43,074 --> 00:03:44,261
Forgot my phone!

43
00:03:44,262 --> 00:03:46,477
What took so long?
Why did you...?

44
00:03:46,582 --> 00:03:48,365
Oh, come on!

45
00:03:49,508 --> 00:03:50,662
Uhh!

46
00:03:50,674 --> 00:03:52,902
I miss her so much!

47
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:55,954
Bye, Gidget! Be a good doggy.

48
00:04:03,405 --> 00:04:05,805
- Hey, Max!
- Hey, Gidget!

49
00:04:05,828 --> 00:04:07,360
Any plans today?

50
00:04:07,417 --> 00:04:10,068
Yes. Big, big
stuff today, Gidget.

51
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:11,645
I got big plans.
I'm gonna sit here

52
00:04:11,668 --> 00:04:13,748
and I'm gonna wait for
Katie to come back.

53
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:15,280
Oh, that sounds exciting.

54
00:04:15,314 --> 00:04:17,154
Well, I won't interrupt.

55
00:04:17,165 --> 00:04:19,920
I've got a very busy day, too.

56
00:04:24,285 --> 00:04:25,577
Here you go.

57
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:27,371
See you later, Chloe.

58
00:04:34,068 --> 00:04:35,314
Bye, Peppi.

59
00:04:45,222 --> 00:04:46,822
So long, Mel.

60
00:04:50,491 --> 00:04:52,194
Bye, Sweet Pea.

61
00:04:52,850 --> 00:04:54,400
See you, Gino.

62
00:04:54,925 --> 00:04:56,110
- Sorry, pal.
- Bye, Mitsy.

63
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:57,954
I'll miss you, Shelly.

64
00:04:57,970 --> 00:04:59,028
Later, Runty.

65
00:04:59,070 --> 00:05:00,331
Bye, everyone.

66
00:05:00,350 --> 00:05:01,440
Bye.

67
00:06:56,422 --> 00:06:58,651
You be a good boy, Leonard.

68
00:07:10,971 --> 00:07:12,057
Hey, Max!

69
00:07:12,068 --> 00:07:13,110
Hey, Chloe.

70
00:07:13,116 --> 00:07:15,585
Do you ever wonder
where they go during the day?

71
00:07:15,587 --> 00:07:18,601
Do you know what?
I just, I don't really care.

72
00:07:18,750 --> 00:07:20,354
Maybe that's what it's
like for you,

73
00:07:20,370 --> 00:07:22,617
but, Katie and I have
a different relationship.

74
00:07:22,628 --> 00:07:24,961
You know, you're a cat,
so, maybe that's why.

75
00:07:24,980 --> 00:07:26,308
'Cause nobody could
ever love a cat

76
00:07:26,331 --> 00:07:28,285
the way they love a dog,
I'm just saying.

77
00:07:28,308 --> 00:07:29,474
Maybe that's why.

78
00:07:29,497 --> 00:07:31,400
Whatever you need
to tell yourself.

79
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:40,430
- Hey, Morning, Max!
- Hey, guys.

80
00:07:40,868 --> 00:07:42,540
What's up, Sweet Pea?

81
00:07:43,485 --> 00:07:45,531
Hey, Mel.
Where've you been, man?

82
00:07:45,542 --> 00:07:46,949
Oh! Get this.

83
00:07:46,950 --> 00:07:50,087
Last sunday, my owner feeds me
a small white pill, right?

84
00:07:50,102 --> 00:07:51,954
I start to feel little groggy.

85
00:07:51,965 --> 00:07:54,925
The next thing I know
I wake up, I'm in the sky!

86
00:07:54,937 --> 00:07:56,285
Wait a minute, the sky?

87
00:07:56,297 --> 00:07:57,928
Yeah, there was
suitcases everywhere.

88
00:07:57,930 --> 00:07:59,975
- I'm locked up in a crate!
- Come on!

89
00:07:59,980 --> 00:08:01,518
There's suitcases in the sky?

90
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:03,220
So, I pass out from fear.

91
00:08:03,222 --> 00:08:05,691
And when I wake up,
I'm in Florida!

92
00:08:05,737 --> 00:08:07,530
Um, this did not happend.

93
00:08:07,531 --> 00:08:09,771
I will never eat a pill
like that again,

94
00:08:09,780 --> 00:08:11,267
unless it's covered in
peanut butter.

95
00:08:11,269 --> 00:08:14,877
Because, I mean come on, right?
It's peanut butter.

96
00:08:15,965 --> 00:08:18,274
- Hey, guys.
- Oh, hey, Norman.

97
00:08:18,285 --> 00:08:20,249
You still looking for
your apartment?

98
00:08:20,250 --> 00:08:22,619
Yeah, going on three weeks, now.

99
00:08:22,719 --> 00:08:24,553
Is this the second
or the third floor?

100
00:08:24,554 --> 00:08:27,491
I don't know any numbers
but, you don't live here.

101
00:08:27,557 --> 00:08:28,892
Oh, damn it.

102
00:08:28,914 --> 00:08:31,005
Well, see you guys later.

103
00:08:31,771 --> 00:08:33,622
You know what? You can do it.

104
00:08:33,885 --> 00:08:35,270
Can't do it.

105
00:08:36,131 --> 00:08:39,198
Buddy, there you are.
Did you find it?

106
00:08:40,537 --> 00:08:42,061
You know I did.

107
00:08:43,173 --> 00:08:44,406
Voila.

108
00:08:45,070 --> 00:08:46,034
- Ball!
- Ball!

109
00:08:46,035 --> 00:08:47,711
Ball! Ball! Ball!

110
00:08:48,145 --> 00:08:49,613
Katie is gonna be so excited.

111
00:08:49,620 --> 00:08:51,792
This is exactly that
what she lost.

112
00:08:51,851 --> 00:08:54,740
I mean, look at it. It's round,
it fits in my mouth.

113
00:08:55,852 --> 00:08:57,320
- Ball!
- Yeah!

114
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:00,360
Oh!

115
00:09:08,011 --> 00:09:11,230
There is no other ball
in the city like this one ball.

116
00:09:11,245 --> 00:09:13,260
Guarantee, this is the ball.

117
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:24,948
Hey!

118
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:27,080
- Katie!
- I'm home, Max.

119
00:09:27,884 --> 00:09:30,720
Hey, Maximillian.
How's your day, buddy?

120
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:32,617
That's a good boy.

121
00:09:32,708 --> 00:09:36,114
Oh, yes. I'm so excited
to see you too, buddy.

122
00:09:36,125 --> 00:09:39,417
Okay, boy. Calm down.
It's okay. Let's all be calm.

123
00:09:39,429 --> 00:09:42,699
Now, I have some big news.

124
00:09:43,266 --> 00:09:46,203
I know this will take some
getting used to, but...

125
00:09:46,651 --> 00:09:49,506
but, I think it's gonna be
a great thing in the long...

126
00:09:50,674 --> 00:09:53,109
Max. This is, Duke.

127
00:09:55,078 --> 00:09:57,848
He's going to be
your... brother.

128
00:10:00,068 --> 00:10:02,118
No, no. Max. Okay.

129
00:10:02,388 --> 00:10:05,130
It's gonna be alright, Duke.
It's okay.

130
00:10:12,971 --> 00:10:15,460
Oh, see? He likes you.

131
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:24,840
Yeah. That's it, Duke.
Take a look around.

132
00:10:26,009 --> 00:10:29,312
I know, buddy.
This is a lot to take in, but...

133
00:10:29,622 --> 00:10:31,181
he didn't have a home.

134
00:10:31,382 --> 00:10:33,717
So, you and I are gonna
have to take care of him.

135
00:10:34,651 --> 00:10:35,651
Okay?

136
00:10:37,394 --> 00:10:40,757
Oh my Gosh!
Duke, found our lost ball.

137
00:10:40,790 --> 00:10:43,185
What a great team
we're gonna be.

138
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:01,210
Love you, Maxi.

139
00:11:03,747 --> 00:11:05,199
Love you, Duke.

140
00:11:11,688 --> 00:11:13,058
Sleep tight, boys.

141
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:17,760
Psst!

142
00:11:19,029 --> 00:11:20,163
Pssst!

143
00:11:21,417 --> 00:11:23,497
Hey! Little guy!

144
00:11:23,817 --> 00:11:25,900
This place is so great.

145
00:11:26,445 --> 00:11:27,630
Uh-huh.

146
00:11:27,637 --> 00:11:30,674
By the way that is...
That is one gorgeous bed.

147
00:11:31,074 --> 00:11:32,775
Yeah, that's okay.

148
00:11:32,776 --> 00:11:34,144
Maybe we could share.

149
00:11:34,250 --> 00:11:36,068
You know, one night
you get the bed,

150
00:11:36,070 --> 00:11:37,757
the next night I do.

151
00:11:37,771 --> 00:11:40,365
- That kind of thing.
- Yo, this bed is mine.

152
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:43,553
You? You get an old blanket.
That suits you.

153
00:11:43,577 --> 00:11:46,090
You're an old blanket
kind of a dog.

154
00:11:46,228 --> 00:11:49,451
Oh, wow. You are a stubborn.

155
00:11:49,455 --> 00:11:52,119
Hey, I got it.
I'm stubborn, too.

156
00:11:52,137 --> 00:11:54,497
- But, we gotta learn to get along.
- Wait, what are you...?

157
00:11:54,502 --> 00:11:56,181
How about we can both
fit in this bed,

158
00:11:56,182 --> 00:11:57,934
if we really trying on
squeeze in there.

159
00:11:57,939 --> 00:11:59,098
No, wait.

160
00:11:59,348 --> 00:12:02,193
Perfect. This is comfy, right?

161
00:12:02,194 --> 00:12:04,190
No, it is not.

162
00:12:04,432 --> 00:12:06,013
I'm comfy.

163
00:12:08,365 --> 00:12:10,240
Duke is just ruining our lives.

164
00:12:10,280 --> 00:12:13,554
He's ruin... It's an emergency
that you get rid of this dog.

165
00:12:13,577 --> 00:12:14,830
He stool my...

166
00:12:17,268 --> 00:12:18,868
And he's scary,
and he's threatening,

167
00:12:18,870 --> 00:12:20,992
and he's the death
of all good things.

168
00:12:20,994 --> 00:12:23,258
Oh! You little cutie pie!

169
00:12:23,259 --> 00:12:25,249
We'll play tomorrow buddy, okay?

170
00:12:25,250 --> 00:12:26,628
Okay, sleep well.

171
00:12:27,874 --> 00:12:30,285
Are you trying to get rid of me?

172
00:12:30,290 --> 00:12:31,952
Before I answer that...

173
00:12:32,422 --> 00:12:34,742
I'd like to know
how much you heard.

174
00:12:34,750 --> 00:12:36,764
So, that's how it's gonna be, huh?

175
00:12:36,765 --> 00:12:39,268
Oh man! You're making me angry.

176
00:12:39,270 --> 00:12:42,090
And when I get angry,
I do this...

177
00:12:43,885 --> 00:12:45,576
And I don't want to do that.

178
00:12:45,577 --> 00:12:47,083
I need this place.

179
00:12:47,097 --> 00:12:49,685
And if it's gonna
come down to you or me?

180
00:12:49,686 --> 00:12:51,680
It's gonna be me!

181
00:12:57,494 --> 00:12:58,695
Ahh!

182
00:13:44,422 --> 00:13:45,639
Morning, Max!

183
00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:47,639
Max! Max! What are you doing?

184
00:13:47,640 --> 00:13:49,640
Hi, it's me. Hi!

185
00:13:51,414 --> 00:13:52,415
Chloe!

186
00:13:52,860 --> 00:13:55,748
Chloe, Chloe!
I got a bad situation.

187
00:13:56,342 --> 00:13:58,850
Katie brought home
a new dog from the pound!

188
00:13:58,868 --> 00:14:01,393
She said, he's my brother.
I don't want a brother.

189
00:14:01,394 --> 00:14:03,459
And I don't, I don't even
have a bed, now.

190
00:14:03,460 --> 00:14:05,460
I'm sleeping on the floor,
like a dog.

191
00:14:05,662 --> 00:14:07,630
Why would Katie do this to me?

192
00:14:07,645 --> 00:14:09,959
Because, she's a dog person, Max.

193
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:14,434
And dog people do wierd,
inexplicable things, like...

194
00:14:14,582 --> 00:14:16,377
they get dogs instead of cats.

195
00:14:16,388 --> 00:14:18,475
Okay, please
don't start now, Chloe.

196
00:14:18,476 --> 00:14:19,828
That is not helping.

197
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:22,880
Max, come on!
I'm your friend, okay?

198
00:14:22,890 --> 00:14:24,742
And as your friend,
I gotta be honest with you,

199
00:14:24,743 --> 00:14:26,628
I don't care about you
or your problems.

200
00:14:26,777 --> 00:14:29,770
But, if you don't do
something about this guy.

201
00:14:29,771 --> 00:14:30,742
And soon,

202
00:14:30,743 --> 00:14:33,709
your perfect little life
with your dump human...

203
00:14:33,710 --> 00:14:35,458
is gonna be over.

204
00:14:35,462 --> 00:14:37,245
- Forever.
- Forever?

205
00:14:37,257 --> 00:14:39,257
Foreve, yeah.
That's what I just...

206
00:14:39,817 --> 00:14:43,098
Why is this mouse
on my paw still?

207
00:14:43,099 --> 00:14:43,977
Ahh.

208
00:14:43,978 --> 00:14:46,843
Look, if you really want to
get your turf back,

209
00:14:46,844 --> 00:14:49,074
you're gonna have to star
acting like the alpha dog.

210
00:14:49,097 --> 00:14:52,537
Right, alpha dog. I can do that.

211
00:14:52,868 --> 00:14:54,319
- Okay! Okay!
- Please, don't go.

212
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:55,851
This time, really don't go.

213
00:14:55,860 --> 00:14:57,337
Okay, I'm running late.
I gotta go.

214
00:14:57,348 --> 00:14:58,915
Wait, wait! No!
Stay, stay for the trick.

215
00:14:58,916 --> 00:15:00,125
Spin. I'm doing spin.

216
00:15:00,137 --> 00:15:01,584
You guys be good.
I'll see you later.

217
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:03,249
- Wait. No, no. Wait, look.
- Okay, Max.

218
00:15:03,250 --> 00:15:04,250
Oh!

219
00:15:11,443 --> 00:15:14,798
Listen, Duke.
I'm not sure if you're aware,

220
00:15:14,930 --> 00:15:19,897
but, one of those food bowls
technically, it's reserved for...

221
00:15:19,908 --> 00:15:22,730
I know, maybe you didn't
read the names, but...

222
00:15:22,807 --> 00:15:23,906
That's my bowl.

223
00:15:23,907 --> 00:15:24,907
Um.

224
00:15:26,582 --> 00:15:28,319
I know, that's... Hey!

225
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:29,771
I mean, I was just thinking...

226
00:15:29,772 --> 00:15:32,400
I don't know, maybe we could
institute some ground rules.

227
00:15:33,080 --> 00:15:34,559
I just thought that if...

228
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:37,287
Or... Or not. I, I don't,
I don't need a bowl.

229
00:15:37,314 --> 00:15:38,160
Here again?

230
00:15:38,161 --> 00:15:40,160
- Rodent!
- Whoa, whoa. No, no!

231
00:15:40,697 --> 00:15:42,160
Aah!

232
00:15:42,674 --> 00:15:43,674
Oh!

233
00:15:45,314 --> 00:15:46,314
Dah!

234
00:15:48,594 --> 00:15:50,060
Oh, Duke!

235
00:15:50,080 --> 00:15:51,633
Duke, Katie is not...

236
00:15:51,634 --> 00:15:54,236
Katie is gonna be upset
when she sees that.

237
00:15:54,237 --> 00:15:57,005
Katie is... gonna flip out

238
00:15:57,006 --> 00:16:00,810
when she sees how
you trashed her whole place.

239
00:16:00,939 --> 00:16:03,146
Oh, it's just,
it's just one vase.

240
00:16:03,314 --> 00:16:05,462
Is it, Duke? Is it?

241
00:16:05,780 --> 00:16:08,000
Oh! That's a shame.

242
00:16:10,609 --> 00:16:12,998
- What are you doing?
- Whoa! What am I doing?

243
00:16:13,229 --> 00:16:16,313
Nothing.
I'm, I'm a cute little doggie.

244
00:16:16,420 --> 00:16:19,992
Katie knows I wouldn't do
anything like this!

245
00:16:20,230 --> 00:16:21,897
No, no! Whoa!

246
00:16:21,898 --> 00:16:22,898
Uhh!

247
00:16:24,749 --> 00:16:28,276
This could only be the work
of a dangerous stray...

248
00:16:28,628 --> 00:16:31,736
who hasn't lay down
a foundation of trust.

249
00:16:31,737 --> 00:16:33,376
You're the new dog.

250
00:16:33,714 --> 00:16:36,670
And... Hey, Duke!
Why'd you going do this for?

251
00:16:36,980 --> 00:16:38,387
Argh! I'm gonna...

252
00:16:38,388 --> 00:16:41,020
Whoa! What, bite me?
Rip my face off?

253
00:16:41,130 --> 00:16:43,254
Perfect.
Wait till Katie finds out,

254
00:16:43,255 --> 00:16:45,908
"Oh! Katie, thank Godness
you're here."

255
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:49,860
"I tried to stop him.
But, he's crazy!"

256
00:16:49,897 --> 00:16:50,990
Uh!

257
00:16:51,314 --> 00:16:52,420
Huh!

258
00:16:52,424 --> 00:16:54,096
Now, sit!

259
00:16:54,097 --> 00:16:56,090
Okay! Okay! Okay!

260
00:16:58,469 --> 00:17:00,468
Lay down.

261
00:17:00,469 --> 00:17:01,968
Argh!

262
00:17:01,969 --> 00:17:03,969
Good boy.

263
00:17:20,114 --> 00:17:22,388
- Hi, Max!
- Hey, Gidget!

264
00:17:22,462 --> 00:17:23,825
Who's your new roommate?

265
00:17:23,826 --> 00:17:25,535
Is it a girl dog, or a boy dog?

266
00:17:25,536 --> 00:17:27,201
Not that I care.
It doesn't matter to me.

267
00:17:27,301 --> 00:17:29,932
Oh, that's nobody, Gidget.
He's just visiting.

268
00:17:30,032 --> 00:17:32,522
Yeah, he, he's gonna
be gone, soon.

269
00:17:42,465 --> 00:17:45,090
- Hey! What's up?
- Oh, Hi!

270
00:17:45,190 --> 00:17:46,879
Your hat is best hat
I ever seen.

271
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:47,650
Hey!

272
00:17:47,702 --> 00:17:51,871
Uhh, excuse me, genius.
You forgot my leash.

273
00:17:51,872 --> 00:17:54,747
Ohh! Never mind.

274
00:17:56,045 --> 00:17:57,920
Hey, fellas. Who's it... Woah!

275
00:17:58,754 --> 00:18:00,610
Hey, fellas. Who's it... Uhwah!

276
00:18:01,348 --> 00:18:03,110
Hey! Fellas! Huweeh!

277
00:18:03,909 --> 00:18:06,504
- Oh! Say, Duke?
- Yes?

278
00:18:06,834 --> 00:18:09,660
Be a good lad and
bring me a stick, won't you?

279
00:18:09,761 --> 00:18:14,050
It would please me to
chew on a stick just now.

280
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:16,419
You heard me. Fetch.

281
00:18:16,420 --> 00:18:17,794
Argh!

282
00:18:20,068 --> 00:18:24,022
Na, na, na. Not that one.
That one doesn't please me.

283
00:18:24,057 --> 00:18:25,817
Find a really good one, Duke.

284
00:18:30,651 --> 00:18:32,520
Yeah, that's it.

285
00:18:33,405 --> 00:18:34,520
Argh.

286
00:18:38,731 --> 00:18:40,199
Hey, Max! Boy!

287
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:43,348
Oh, wow! There are a ton of
sticks over here, Max!

288
00:18:43,565 --> 00:18:45,131
You should come over
and look at them.

289
00:18:45,154 --> 00:18:47,691
Yeah, I want to make sure
I grab the right one.

290
00:18:47,714 --> 00:18:50,490
Well, that's very...
That's very thoughtful.

291
00:18:53,245 --> 00:18:55,650
Look at all these sticks!

292
00:18:56,052 --> 00:18:57,053
Ha!

293
00:18:57,177 --> 00:18:59,820
Whoa! Help! Help!

294
00:19:00,217 --> 00:19:01,980
Hey, did you hear that?

295
00:19:02,491 --> 00:19:03,480
Butterfly!

296
00:19:03,481 --> 00:19:06,496
- Butterfly! Butterfly!
- Oh, butterfly! Let's get it!

297
00:19:11,531 --> 00:19:12,880
Wha... What's...

298
00:19:13,428 --> 00:19:16,189
Ahh! Whoa! Ahhh!

299
00:19:16,190 --> 00:19:17,051
Oh!

300
00:19:17,211 --> 00:19:18,211
Aww!

301
00:19:18,875 --> 00:19:19,875
Ahh!

302
00:19:20,674 --> 00:19:22,240
Oh! Ahh!

303
00:19:22,765 --> 00:19:24,240
Ahh!

304
00:19:26,416 --> 00:19:27,617
Ahhh!

305
00:19:27,954 --> 00:19:29,702
Ahh! Oh! Oh!

306
00:19:30,502 --> 00:19:31,451
Argh!

307
00:19:31,452 --> 00:19:33,033
Wow! Uhh!

308
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:34,981
Hel.. Hel.. Help Help, Help!

309
00:19:34,982 --> 00:19:37,393
- So long.
- Don't leave me here.

310
00:19:37,394 --> 00:19:39,005
Didn't have to be this way, Max.

311
00:19:39,028 --> 00:19:40,811
- Wait!
- No heart feelings.

312
00:19:40,822 --> 00:19:42,845
Duke, Please!

313
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:47,268
- Boy, what's going on here?
- Mind your own business...

314
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:48,730
Oh my Gosh!
What happened to you?

315
00:19:48,742 --> 00:19:50,500
Oh, I had a fight, alright?

316
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:54,182
With a big stupid dog. He lost.

317
00:19:54,290 --> 00:19:58,307
Oh! You're heading into a dangerous
territory there, kitty cat!

318
00:19:58,308 --> 00:20:00,600
I'd watch your tone, sunshine.

319
00:20:00,707 --> 00:20:02,114
Know what I'm gonna do?

320
00:20:02,115 --> 00:20:03,805
I'm gonna catch you
into a string,

321
00:20:03,817 --> 00:20:07,177
pull you up, and then I bet
you run for hours,

322
00:20:07,188 --> 00:20:09,610
in a game that only I understand.

323
00:20:09,885 --> 00:20:11,497
Oh. Very nice.

324
00:20:11,942 --> 00:20:13,337
I'll take that!

325
00:20:13,622 --> 00:20:14,622
Huh?

326
00:20:16,868 --> 00:20:18,099
Oh!

327
00:20:18,100 --> 00:20:20,628
Oh! Huh! Whoo-hoo!

328
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:22,605
You want to start
with me, little raisin?

329
00:20:23,542 --> 00:20:25,861
Okay, get your umbrellas out, kitties.

330
00:20:25,862 --> 00:20:27,977
Because, here they come...

331
00:20:27,988 --> 00:20:32,250
The thunder! And the lightning!
Right down on your face.

332
00:20:36,925 --> 00:20:39,451
Gosh, there are a lot
of you up there.

333
00:20:39,462 --> 00:20:40,989
I'm talking about thunder
and lightning,

334
00:20:40,990 --> 00:20:43,782
and it's coming down on all
of your collected faces.

335
00:20:44,091 --> 00:20:47,050
Attack on, three, two...

336
00:20:47,563 --> 00:20:49,298
Ahhhh!

337
00:20:49,474 --> 00:20:50,480
Ohh!

338
00:20:51,531 --> 00:20:54,260
I just remember,
I gotta be somewhere!

339
00:20:54,363 --> 00:20:55,821
Ha-ha! That...

340
00:20:55,938 --> 00:20:59,342
Haha, ha! That guy, huh?
Am I right?

341
00:21:00,994 --> 00:21:02,273
Okay, I'm just... You know what?

342
00:21:02,274 --> 00:21:04,270
I'm just gonna...
It's no offense, but... Bye!

343
00:21:07,083 --> 00:21:08,083
Ohh!

344
00:21:09,152 --> 00:21:10,286
Whoaa!

345
00:21:10,834 --> 00:21:12,581
Ahh! Whoa! Whoa!

346
00:21:12,582 --> 00:21:14,580
Ahhhh!

347
00:21:15,462 --> 00:21:16,462
Uhh!

348
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:18,360
Uh-huh!

349
00:21:22,465 --> 00:21:24,733
Whoa! Ahhh!

350
00:21:24,734 --> 00:21:28,504
Ahhh! Ahhhh!

351
00:21:28,777 --> 00:21:30,130
Huh?

352
00:21:31,574 --> 00:21:32,708
Ha!

353
00:21:33,211 --> 00:21:34,211
He-Huh!

354
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:35,480
Hey!

355
00:21:36,530 --> 00:21:37,794
Hey, you little...

356
00:21:37,817 --> 00:21:39,531
Whoaa!

357
00:21:39,820 --> 00:21:41,908
Whoaa! Ohh!

358
00:21:41,931 --> 00:21:43,611
Ahh! Uh!

359
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:47,360
Blah!

360
00:21:47,691 --> 00:21:48,910
Duke?

361
00:21:50,114 --> 00:21:52,460
- You came back?
- Run!

362
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:55,428
Whoa! Ahhh!

363
00:21:55,908 --> 00:21:56,908
Wow!

364
00:21:57,051 --> 00:21:59,300
It's the Po-Po! Scram!

365
00:22:04,331 --> 00:22:05,085
Hay!

366
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:07,376
Huh! Ah! Whoah!

367
00:22:09,245 --> 00:22:10,307
Wait!

368
00:22:14,417 --> 00:22:17,420
Two, four, six, eight. Mmmm.

369
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:19,740
- See you tomorrow, Germo!
- You know it.

370
00:22:19,957 --> 00:22:22,637
Ten... Ah, okay.

371
00:22:23,177 --> 00:22:24,290
Right.

372
00:22:25,920 --> 00:22:27,302
Uh-Huh.

373
00:22:27,325 --> 00:22:29,520
- Did you see that?
- Yeah, I saw it.

374
00:22:29,542 --> 00:22:32,285
Throw it with your arm,
you lazy weirdo.

375
00:22:32,308 --> 00:22:34,380
I would not fetch that.
I'm old school.

376
00:22:42,605 --> 00:22:43,740
Ahh!

377
00:22:46,148 --> 00:22:48,184
Humph! Thanks a lot, Duke.

378
00:22:48,194 --> 00:22:49,852
I don't like to use this phrase,

379
00:22:49,862 --> 00:22:53,165
because it is offensive to our kind,
but you're a bad dog.

380
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:55,211
Katie is not gonna like this.

381
00:22:55,212 --> 00:22:57,440
I, I can't go to the pound!

382
00:22:58,548 --> 00:23:00,937
What? What's wrong with you?

383
00:23:01,177 --> 00:23:02,559
Well, Katie just...

384
00:23:02,560 --> 00:23:05,165
She just got me out
of the pound.

385
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:07,180
And if I go back...

386
00:23:08,377 --> 00:23:10,422
Back it's the end of
the life for me.

387
00:23:18,102 --> 00:23:20,457
La pasión de la pasión.

388
00:23:20,537 --> 00:23:22,610
Ha! Yes! Mmmm.

389
00:23:23,005 --> 00:23:25,497
Why? Why?!

390
00:23:25,508 --> 00:23:27,142
What's the matter, Maria?

391
00:23:27,144 --> 00:23:28,811
Maria, your face!

392
00:23:28,822 --> 00:23:31,942
It worths a thousand souls.
What's wrong?

393
00:23:31,954 --> 00:23:36,468
I have come face-to-face
with a worst thing in the world!

394
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:39,577
What? Oh, tell me, Maria.
Tell me now!

395
00:23:39,588 --> 00:23:42,194
I can not bear another moment
without knowing!

396
00:23:42,205 --> 00:23:43,920
Loneliness.

397
00:23:44,194 --> 00:23:45,194
Huh!

398
00:23:45,348 --> 00:23:46,514
Huh!

399
00:23:46,736 --> 00:23:49,458
- But, Maria. You can not be lonely.
- Ha! Max. Max!

400
00:23:49,668 --> 00:23:51,748
Max! Huh?

401
00:23:51,954 --> 00:23:53,879
Hey! I see you, squirrel!

402
00:23:53,880 --> 00:23:56,388
This is not your area!
We marked that tree!

403
00:23:57,111 --> 00:23:59,811
Don't you trying hide.
I can see you... Ahh!

404
00:24:00,170 --> 00:24:01,634
What was that? How dare you?

405
00:24:01,645 --> 00:24:03,120
- Hey, guys! Where's Max?
- Hey! No!

406
00:24:03,142 --> 00:24:05,379
Nobody likes you, squirrels!

407
00:24:05,380 --> 00:24:07,380
- No! Aww!
- Ahh!

408
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:10,147
Guys, seriously. Where is Max?

409
00:24:10,148 --> 00:24:12,140
Calm down, girl. He's right...

410
00:24:12,457 --> 00:24:14,109
Huh! He's gone.

411
00:24:14,110 --> 00:24:15,119
All is fine!

412
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:18,808
I heard him screaming after
he disappeared into those bushes!

413
00:24:20,091 --> 00:24:21,800
Max is gone?

414
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:24,799
This is bad. This is so bad.

415
00:24:24,800 --> 00:24:27,116
Maria, if he's your true love.

416
00:24:27,131 --> 00:24:29,324
You must go to him.

417
00:24:29,325 --> 00:24:31,554
Save him. Save him!

418
00:24:31,874 --> 00:24:34,609
Yes! Yes! Save my true love!

419
00:24:34,610 --> 00:24:36,480
Run! Come on! Go!

420
00:24:36,502 --> 00:24:38,230
I'm coming, Max!

421
00:24:40,563 --> 00:24:42,698
Aahhh!

422
00:24:42,845 --> 00:24:44,690
Aaahh!

423
00:24:48,982 --> 00:24:50,421
Hi, Chloe. If anyone ask,

424
00:24:50,422 --> 00:24:52,420
I'm on my way to the roof
to look for, Max.

425
00:24:54,443 --> 00:24:55,644
Okay, Bye-bye.

426
00:25:04,445 --> 00:25:06,100
Whoa! You see that?

427
00:25:06,891 --> 00:25:08,550
Yeah, give me a second.

428
00:25:11,188 --> 00:25:13,639
Aww! Hey, there cute little bunny.

429
00:25:13,640 --> 00:25:16,194
What are you doing
in the middle of the road?

430
00:25:17,967 --> 00:25:18,967
Aahhh!

431
00:25:23,874 --> 00:25:24,879
Bunny!

432
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:25,988
Huh?

433
00:25:26,491 --> 00:25:28,180
Hey, what's going on?

434
00:25:28,831 --> 00:25:29,945
What the...?

435
00:25:31,474 --> 00:25:33,880
- Save yourself!
- Shut it, human.

436
00:25:33,989 --> 00:25:36,920
Let's dow this now! Now! Now!

437
00:25:44,445 --> 00:25:46,079
Wait up!

438
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:48,079
Get off me, pig!

439
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:49,497
Ooh! Ouch!

440
00:25:49,498 --> 00:25:50,599
Get off!

441
00:25:54,637 --> 00:25:56,205
Whoo-ooh! Aah!

442
00:25:56,457 --> 00:25:57,870
Whoah!

443
00:26:00,800 --> 00:26:02,930
- What's happening?
- I don't know!

444
00:26:06,171 --> 00:26:08,360
Ripper? Ripper, where you at?

445
00:26:09,074 --> 00:26:11,654
Let's go, Ripper.
I'm bustin' you outta here.

446
00:26:17,211 --> 00:26:18,914
The revolution has begun!

447
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:22,444
Librated forever!
Domesticated never!

448
00:26:22,445 --> 00:26:24,440
Yeah!

449
00:26:25,134 --> 00:26:26,134
Ouch!

450
00:26:26,468 --> 00:26:28,290
Who's driving this thing?

451
00:26:32,508 --> 00:26:34,109
Whoo-hoo!

452
00:26:37,222 --> 00:26:38,980
Aaahhh!

453
00:26:42,718 --> 00:26:43,752
Ah!

454
00:26:49,097 --> 00:26:50,860
Ha-ha! Huh!

455
00:26:56,365 --> 00:26:58,057
Ooh!

456
00:27:00,731 --> 00:27:02,900
Let's go. Let's go! Let's go!

457
00:27:06,411 --> 00:27:08,251
- Who are you, guys?
- Huh?

458
00:27:08,262 --> 00:27:09,344
Who are we?

459
00:27:09,345 --> 00:27:11,340
Who are we?!

460
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:14,434
We are The Flushed Pets.

461
00:27:14,777 --> 00:27:18,571
Thrown away by our owners,
and now we're out for revenge!

462
00:27:18,731 --> 00:27:21,820
It's like a club but with
biting and scratching.

463
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:23,770
Ta.. Take us with you.

464
00:27:25,461 --> 00:27:27,496
I don't think so, pets.

465
00:27:27,508 --> 00:27:30,125
Yeah, you got the stench of
domestication all over you.

466
00:27:30,342 --> 00:27:33,154
You chose your side.
And now you're gonna burn.

467
00:27:33,177 --> 00:27:35,489
No! Stop! Who you calling pets?

468
00:27:35,490 --> 00:27:36,616
I ain't no pets.

469
00:27:36,617 --> 00:27:38,777
You got it all wrong.
We're just like you, guys.

470
00:27:38,778 --> 00:27:39,988
We hate humans.

471
00:27:40,010 --> 00:27:41,600
- Oh, yeah! That's right.
- Hate them.

472
00:27:41,622 --> 00:27:44,457
Oh, man. Don't get me started
on people. Am I right, Duke?

473
00:27:44,460 --> 00:27:47,031
Yeah, That's why
we burned our collars, man!

474
00:27:47,057 --> 00:27:50,050
- We burned 'em to the ground.
- It killed our owners.

475
00:27:50,068 --> 00:27:52,087
Yeah... Wait a minute.
That's too far, maybe?

476
00:27:52,100 --> 00:27:52,868
No, they dig it.

477
00:27:52,869 --> 00:27:54,834
- Yes, we whacked 'em.
- Yeah, that's right.

478
00:27:54,857 --> 00:27:56,592
Bang! Bang! With our own paws.

479
00:27:56,593 --> 00:27:58,662
I had a dime
for every owner I kill.

480
00:27:58,674 --> 00:28:00,830
- Oh, yeah.
- I had a dime...

481
00:28:01,820 --> 00:28:03,668
'Cause I just killed the one.

482
00:28:03,942 --> 00:28:06,080
Whoo-ooh!

483
00:28:06,252 --> 00:28:07,802
Oh, you're cold-blooded.

484
00:28:07,803 --> 00:28:10,160
Oh man, you remind me
my boy, Ricky.

485
00:28:10,347 --> 00:28:13,499
He died, tho. R.I.P, Ricky.

486
00:28:13,960 --> 00:28:14,708
You know what truth is?

487
00:28:14,709 --> 00:28:16,700
The struggle could use
some more muscle.

488
00:28:17,005 --> 00:28:18,350
Alright, look.
I'll tell you what.

489
00:28:18,450 --> 00:28:19,746
We bust the both
of you outta here,

490
00:28:19,747 --> 00:28:21,702
but understand this,
from now on you work for me.

491
00:28:21,714 --> 00:28:24,050
- That's fine.
- Sounds like a fun challenge.

492
00:28:25,554 --> 00:28:26,422
Aah! Oh!

493
00:28:26,452 --> 00:28:28,585
Alright, guys. Let's do this.

494
00:28:29,491 --> 00:28:30,592
Aaah!

495
00:28:32,067 --> 00:28:35,289
- To the sewers!
- The sewers?

496
00:28:35,460 --> 00:28:38,045
What are you waiting for?
I'm not playin'.

497
00:28:38,263 --> 00:28:41,505
I said, to the sewers!

498
00:28:48,534 --> 00:28:51,761
Long live the revolution, suckers!

499
00:28:56,324 --> 00:28:57,736
I can do it.

500
00:29:03,726 --> 00:29:04,893
Max!

501
00:29:05,851 --> 00:29:06,890
Max!

502
00:29:07,337 --> 00:29:09,337
Max! Max!

503
00:29:09,610 --> 00:29:12,514
Max! Max! Max!

504
00:29:25,402 --> 00:29:27,402
Where are you, Max?

505
00:29:29,862 --> 00:29:32,376
Looks like you could
use a little help.

506
00:29:32,377 --> 00:29:33,789
Who said that?

507
00:29:33,790 --> 00:29:35,249
Over here!

508
00:29:35,250 --> 00:29:38,148
In this dark and forbidding shed.

509
00:29:46,130 --> 00:29:48,656
Uh... Hello?

510
00:29:48,888 --> 00:29:50,920
I can see from miles.

511
00:29:51,023 --> 00:29:53,964
If you let me out,
I'll find your friend.

512
00:29:54,077 --> 00:29:57,613
Wow! Really!
Aww! You're so sweet!

513
00:29:57,692 --> 00:29:59,714
You're sweet, too.

514
00:29:59,715 --> 00:30:01,710
Ooh! Thanks stranger.

515
00:30:02,086 --> 00:30:06,943
But not so sweet, there's also
a salty, gainly thing going on.

516
00:30:07,043 --> 00:30:08,157
Yeah, that's me.

517
00:30:08,616 --> 00:30:10,480
Come on, let's get you
outta that shed.

518
00:30:11,713 --> 00:30:15,221
Yeah, that's it. Just step over
the pile of bones.

519
00:30:15,321 --> 00:30:17,668
Pile of bones. Okay, well do.

520
00:30:18,368 --> 00:30:20,269
I sure hope Max is safe.

521
00:30:20,270 --> 00:30:22,488
You're a very thoughtful food.

522
00:30:22,506 --> 00:30:25,360
Food? I didn't say that.
I said friend.

523
00:30:25,882 --> 00:30:29,539
I meant food, Fri... Friend.
You know what I meant.

524
00:30:29,639 --> 00:30:32,439
I'm sure lucky I found you...
Uh...

525
00:30:32,440 --> 00:30:33,662
Tiberius.

526
00:30:33,670 --> 00:30:36,151
And yes, this is a very good
thing for you.

527
00:30:36,152 --> 00:30:38,568
This whole meeting me thing.

528
00:30:38,924 --> 00:30:40,595
Take off my hood.

529
00:30:44,008 --> 00:30:45,008
Ha!

530
00:30:46,995 --> 00:30:48,190
Aahh!

531
00:30:50,462 --> 00:30:51,700
Aaahhh!

532
00:30:52,995 --> 00:30:55,400
Ow! The chain!

533
00:30:56,346 --> 00:30:58,859
Oh, you tried to eat me!

534
00:30:58,860 --> 00:31:00,017
I'm sorry!

535
00:31:00,460 --> 00:31:03,635
You should be sorry!
You deserve to be locked up!

536
00:31:03,650 --> 00:31:05,271
You're a bad, bad bird!

537
00:31:05,280 --> 00:31:08,426
I can't help it!
I was born with killer instincts!

538
00:31:08,435 --> 00:31:10,159
That is just no excuse!

539
00:31:10,160 --> 00:31:12,960
You're right, even for a predator
I'm selfish.

540
00:31:12,970 --> 00:31:15,004
I'm selfish predator.

541
00:31:15,357 --> 00:31:18,627
It's no wonder
I have no friends. Nobody.

542
00:31:19,361 --> 00:31:21,630
I... I... This is hopeless. I...

543
00:31:21,653 --> 00:31:24,613
Oh, don't.
There is no need to cry.

544
00:31:24,622 --> 00:31:26,764
I'm sorry that I yalled
at you before.

545
00:31:26,773 --> 00:31:28,529
Please take off the chain.

546
00:31:28,530 --> 00:31:31,395
This time I'll help you,
I promise.

547
00:31:32,136 --> 00:31:36,484
Tiberius, this is gonna sound
completely horrible, but um...

548
00:31:36,915 --> 00:31:38,880
I don't fully trust you.

549
00:31:41,511 --> 00:31:43,009
Oh! No, no, but...

550
00:31:43,010 --> 00:31:45,164
I guess everyone deserves
a second chance,

551
00:31:45,173 --> 00:31:47,223
And you are just a lonely
old bird,

552
00:31:47,224 --> 00:31:48,551
And you do have weird manners,

553
00:31:48,552 --> 00:31:51,004
because you live in
a weird shed on a roof.

554
00:31:51,022 --> 00:31:54,440
So, I'll tell you what,
if you find Max...

555
00:31:54,817 --> 00:31:56,464
I'll be your best friend!

556
00:31:56,465 --> 00:31:58,460
Best friend?

557
00:31:58,702 --> 00:32:00,130
You and me?

558
00:32:01,637 --> 00:32:03,539
Whoo-ooh!

559
00:32:06,175 --> 00:32:07,409
Awww!

560
00:32:09,945 --> 00:32:11,246
Whoo-ooh!

561
00:32:15,048 --> 00:32:16,850
Yaah!

562
00:32:18,337 --> 00:32:21,981
Yes! That sounds nice.
Let's do this.

563
00:32:21,982 --> 00:32:23,192
Okay.

564
00:32:29,840 --> 00:32:32,310
So, what does this Max look like?

565
00:32:32,311 --> 00:32:34,803
Brown and white,
he's a short hair,

566
00:32:34,817 --> 00:32:38,400
roguishly handsome,
he's got a sparkle in his eye.

567
00:32:38,426 --> 00:32:39,945
He sounds dreamy.

568
00:32:39,946 --> 00:32:42,711
Ohh! You have no idea.

569
00:32:42,728 --> 00:32:45,450
I mean, what! Whatever!
Shut up. Pfff!

570
00:32:47,777 --> 00:32:49,179
If my owner comes,

571
00:32:49,180 --> 00:32:51,680
put on the hood
and pretend to be me.

572
00:32:51,706 --> 00:32:53,395
Okay, thank you!

573
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:08,570
Ugh! The smell is disgusting...
ly good!

574
00:33:08,586 --> 00:33:11,470
This is also great.
We love it here.

575
00:33:19,548 --> 00:33:20,548
Huh!

576
00:33:21,137 --> 00:33:24,240
What's the password?

577
00:33:24,390 --> 00:33:25,715
Password?

578
00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:29,119
Look, look at me.
I am your leader.

579
00:33:29,120 --> 00:33:31,927
The leader does not
decide the password.

580
00:33:31,940 --> 00:33:34,007
The leader makes up
the password, idiots!

581
00:33:34,008 --> 00:33:36,131
Everybody, I'm making up
a new password, right now.

582
00:33:36,142 --> 00:33:40,402
The new password, is don't ask
the leader for the password!

583
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:43,850
Follow me.

584
00:33:51,333 --> 00:33:54,177
Welcome to The Underbelly, brothers.

585
00:33:54,417 --> 00:33:56,906
Home of the flushed pets.

586
00:34:19,448 --> 00:34:21,253
Brothers and sisters,

587
00:34:21,271 --> 00:34:25,342
as you see, I've return from
the surface with two new recruits.

588
00:34:25,351 --> 00:34:27,840
These guys are owner killers.

589
00:34:28,317 --> 00:34:29,251
Yay!

590
00:34:29,271 --> 00:34:32,070
Hey! Hey! Settle it down!

591
00:34:32,586 --> 00:34:35,208
Guys! I want you to tell 'em
how you did it.

592
00:34:35,368 --> 00:34:38,222
Go ahead, tell 'em the whole story
about how you took out your owner.

593
00:34:38,231 --> 00:34:41,083
Don't leave out nothing.
We love gory detail here.

594
00:34:41,084 --> 00:34:42,698
- Oh yeah!
- Tell us!

595
00:34:42,711 --> 00:34:44,320
- Right.
- So, tell 'em, Max.

596
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:46,109
Okay, okay. So...

597
00:34:46,110 --> 00:34:47,555
- I was like...
- Well, we were like...

598
00:34:47,573 --> 00:34:49,970
- Take that, stupid owner.
- Yeah.

599
00:34:50,337 --> 00:34:52,810
So, that's...
That who you're dealing with.

600
00:34:54,168 --> 00:34:55,843
Hey, that's story bored me
to death.

601
00:34:55,844 --> 00:34:57,169
Boring!

602
00:34:57,170 --> 00:34:58,609
Give us detail.

603
00:34:58,610 --> 00:35:00,302
Okay. Max?

604
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:02,283
Okay, Well... Uh...

605
00:35:02,284 --> 00:35:04,353
So, there's this...
There's this thing in the kitchen.

606
00:35:04,354 --> 00:35:05,360
Yeah, table.

607
00:35:05,377 --> 00:35:06,986
- It's like flat...
- Toaster.

608
00:35:07,004 --> 00:35:09,090
And then, round on
just the end of it.

609
00:35:09,091 --> 00:35:10,091
A spoon?

610
00:35:10,092 --> 00:35:11,768
- Yes, a spoon!
- Exactly.

611
00:35:11,780 --> 00:35:13,671
You can't hurt someone
with a spoon.

612
00:35:13,672 --> 00:35:15,617
You scoop with a spoon.

613
00:35:15,786 --> 00:35:18,186
How many people wanna know
how to kill somebody with a spoon?

614
00:35:18,311 --> 00:35:19,900
- I do!
- Oh yeah!

615
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:23,360
Okay. Well, we use a spoon...

616
00:35:23,380 --> 00:35:25,440
Hit the button on this machine...

617
00:35:25,457 --> 00:35:26,450
- Right, right.
- On the counter.

618
00:35:26,451 --> 00:35:28,042
- And it's go those...
- The... You know...

619
00:35:28,043 --> 00:35:29,431
- Those blades.
- It's got blades!

620
00:35:29,448 --> 00:35:31,999
Was it a blender? Whaoh!

621
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:34,000
You blending somebody?

622
00:35:34,491 --> 00:35:36,050
He's talk about the blender, guys.

623
00:35:36,051 --> 00:35:37,614
Oh, please!
Tell me it was a blender.

624
00:35:37,615 --> 00:35:39,839
Hey, buddy.
I don't ask what it's call,

625
00:35:39,840 --> 00:35:41,990
- We just kill with it.
- But, it was a blender.

626
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:43,920
Wow! Do ya'll hear this?

627
00:35:44,266 --> 00:35:45,860
You know who's like this?

628
00:35:45,861 --> 00:35:48,597
Ricky! Rest in peace.

629
00:35:48,995 --> 00:35:51,367
Ricky was the only
soldier I had...

630
00:35:51,368 --> 00:35:53,360
that was ready to kill
humans on sight.

631
00:35:54,008 --> 00:35:55,704
Everybody else need a pet talk.

632
00:35:55,870 --> 00:35:57,448
Not these two brothers.

633
00:35:57,466 --> 00:35:59,630
Whoa-hoo! Yay!

634
00:35:59,946 --> 00:36:04,220
See, all of us have suffered
at the hands of man.

635
00:36:04,497 --> 00:36:05,846
I mean, take me for instance.

636
00:36:05,847 --> 00:36:08,316
I was a magician's rabbit
for kids parties.

637
00:36:08,648 --> 00:36:11,460
But then, bunny tricks
went out of style.

638
00:36:11,840 --> 00:36:12,737
So, what did my owner do?

639
00:36:12,738 --> 00:36:15,003
My owner went and left
magic behind,

640
00:36:15,004 --> 00:36:16,434
And made me disappear...

641
00:36:16,435 --> 00:36:18,435
From his life!

642
00:36:18,727 --> 00:36:19,594
Uh-huh.

643
00:36:19,608 --> 00:36:21,607
I lived in a tattoo parlor.

644
00:36:21,608 --> 00:36:24,299
The trainees used to practice
on me.

645
00:36:24,533 --> 00:36:26,501
Until they ran outta space!

646
00:36:27,594 --> 00:36:29,741
I mean, yes.
Human say they love us,

647
00:36:29,841 --> 00:36:32,287
But then, they turn around
and throw us out like garbage.

648
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:34,130
Ain't that right, Seamonkeys?

649
00:36:34,435 --> 00:36:37,127
Hey! It's not our fault
we don't look like the ad.

650
00:36:37,128 --> 00:36:38,225
Yeah.

651
00:36:38,226 --> 00:36:41,682
Alright, you guys are joining
The Brotherhood.

652
00:36:41,683 --> 00:36:43,606
It's initiation time.

653
00:36:43,852 --> 00:36:45,487
- What?
- I'm sorry, what time?

654
00:36:45,644 --> 00:36:48,026
Summon the Viper!

655
00:36:51,022 --> 00:36:52,790
Is this Viper poisonous?

656
00:36:52,794 --> 00:36:55,464
Because I should warning you
I'm very allergic to poison!

657
00:37:02,524 --> 00:37:05,020
Ouch! Ah!

658
00:37:05,315 --> 00:37:07,210
Alright, show her.

659
00:37:12,906 --> 00:37:15,850
Huh! Max's collar! Where is he?

660
00:37:15,851 --> 00:37:17,919
Wha... Wha...
What happened to him?

661
00:37:17,920 --> 00:37:19,608
Oi, I ain't say nothing.

662
00:37:20,417 --> 00:37:24,520
You're gonna tell us where Max is,
and you're gonna tell us now!

663
00:37:26,168 --> 00:37:28,630
Is this supposed to scare me?
I'm a cat.

664
00:37:28,648 --> 00:37:31,022
- I'll end on my feet.
- Does it always happen?

665
00:37:31,031 --> 00:37:33,706
'Cause your head looks like
it's taken a lot of landings.

666
00:37:33,937 --> 00:37:35,035
Do you want me to catch you?

667
00:37:35,036 --> 00:37:37,572
'Cause I'll catch you this way,
and let you look like a waffle.

668
00:37:38,737 --> 00:37:42,399
Okay, he's too stupid to talk
and too ugly to eat.

669
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:43,400
Aahhh!

670
00:37:43,502 --> 00:37:45,779
I'm done playing nice!

671
00:37:45,780 --> 00:37:48,426
Where is Max?!

672
00:37:49,180 --> 00:37:50,336
- Oh!
- Tell me!

673
00:37:50,337 --> 00:37:51,319
What? Aw!

674
00:37:51,320 --> 00:37:52,666
I ju... I can't... Aww!

675
00:37:52,667 --> 00:37:55,591
Let me finish... Aww! Help me!

676
00:37:55,593 --> 00:37:57,791
Don't look at him, look at me!

677
00:37:57,792 --> 00:37:59,861
Nobody can help you!

678
00:37:59,884 --> 00:38:02,329
Where is Max?!

679
00:38:02,330 --> 00:38:04,666
Okay! Okay! He's in the sewers.

680
00:38:04,684 --> 00:38:07,259
He got taken.
Please, have mercy!

681
00:38:07,260 --> 00:38:08,969
Adorable buffy dog.

682
00:38:08,970 --> 00:38:09,715
Huh!

683
00:38:09,902 --> 00:38:13,139
Snake bite! Snake bite!
Snake bite!

684
00:38:13,140 --> 00:38:15,431
Snake bite! Snake bite!

685
00:38:15,443 --> 00:38:18,812
Snake bite! Snake bite!
Snake bite!

686
00:38:18,813 --> 00:38:21,049
Snake bite! Snake bite!

687
00:38:23,652 --> 00:38:24,652
Aww!

688
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:26,639
As proof of your allegiance,

689
00:38:26,640 --> 00:38:29,591
You're now receve the bite
of a one fang...

690
00:38:29,608 --> 00:38:31,492
half-blind Viper,

691
00:38:31,493 --> 00:38:36,431
fueled by a diet of
anti human rage!

692
00:38:56,177 --> 00:38:57,580
Who wants to go first?

693
00:38:58,040 --> 00:39:00,221
Uh... Yeah.
Hey, here's the thing, tho.

694
00:39:00,222 --> 00:39:01,973
- I mean, It's...
- Tiny dog.

695
00:39:02,693 --> 00:39:04,223
Can I call you, tiny dog?

696
00:39:04,224 --> 00:39:06,115
It fits you. Let's admit that.

697
00:39:06,231 --> 00:39:07,195
Mate, look.

698
00:39:07,196 --> 00:39:09,875
Between you and the fat dog?
I like you the best.

699
00:39:09,893 --> 00:39:10,999
Oh, thank you.

700
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:14,933
Tiny dog is gonna fo first.
Everybody, T.D is going first.

701
00:39:14,951 --> 00:39:15,937
No, no, no!

702
00:39:15,938 --> 00:39:18,839
Tiny dog does not wannago first,
take the fat dog.

703
00:39:18,840 --> 00:39:20,207
Aww! Aahh!

704
00:39:20,208 --> 00:39:22,199
- No, no, no! Stop!
- Snake bite! Snake bite!

705
00:39:22,200 --> 00:39:25,879
Snake bite! Snake bite!
Snake bite! Snake bite!

706
00:39:25,880 --> 00:39:27,880
No, no, no, no!

707
00:39:30,497 --> 00:39:34,053
What are you doing,
initiating a couple of domestics?

708
00:39:34,071 --> 00:39:35,013
Domestics?

709
00:39:35,031 --> 00:39:37,057
Yeah, we just dumped
those two in the alley,

710
00:39:37,058 --> 00:39:38,760
Slashed two of their collars.

711
00:39:38,968 --> 00:39:40,819
No, no, no.
That.. That's not true.

712
00:39:40,820 --> 00:39:42,163
You said, you burned your collars.

713
00:39:42,180 --> 00:39:45,137
Well, burned, lost,
had 'em stolen by a cat.

714
00:39:45,155 --> 00:39:47,530
It's all just word.
Really? Isn't it?

715
00:39:47,688 --> 00:39:50,150
You don't deserve to be
marked by a Viper.

716
00:39:50,168 --> 00:39:52,071
- Oh, wow!
- We'll just show ourselves out.

717
00:39:52,080 --> 00:39:55,288
You deserve to be eaten
by the Viper.

718
00:39:55,502 --> 00:39:57,466
Het those leash lovers!

719
00:39:58,880 --> 00:40:00,080
Aahhh!

720
00:40:03,251 --> 00:40:04,608
Hold on!

721
00:40:12,148 --> 00:40:14,041
Go get 'em, Duke!

722
00:40:14,062 --> 00:40:15,062
Whoa!

723
00:40:51,047 --> 00:40:54,003
Uhh. Fellas, that was an accident.

724
00:40:54,103 --> 00:40:57,461
You squished the sacred Viper?

725
00:40:58,054 --> 00:41:01,302
He's a flapjack! Oh, Viper.

726
00:41:01,864 --> 00:41:05,450
Viper, you in a better place.
You and Ricky.

727
00:41:10,301 --> 00:41:12,556
You ain't never did
nothing to nobody.

728
00:41:12,650 --> 00:41:14,399
Well, you bit a lot of people, Viper.

729
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:16,329
So technically, you might
actually deserve this.

730
00:41:16,330 --> 00:41:18,861
This might be something
that was long overdue.

731
00:41:18,862 --> 00:41:19,537
But...

732
00:41:19,538 --> 00:41:22,460
It shouldn't came like this.
Not on my watch.

733
00:41:22,806 --> 00:41:24,382
Get 'em!

734
00:41:26,568 --> 00:41:27,569
Whoah!

735
00:41:27,958 --> 00:41:29,284
Come on!

736
00:41:46,862 --> 00:41:49,010
Aw! Wait on, Duke!

737
00:41:52,961 --> 00:41:55,953
We're sorry.
Can this be over, now?

738
00:41:56,631 --> 00:41:57,798
We've got a problem!

739
00:41:57,799 --> 00:41:59,270
We have so many problems.

740
00:41:59,271 --> 00:42:01,990
Which one do you mean it,
this moment?

741
00:42:06,924 --> 00:42:09,973
Stop running, dummies!
Stop it, right there!

742
00:42:09,982 --> 00:42:12,470
- Hold your breathe!
- Hold my breathe?

743
00:42:22,724 --> 00:42:26,194
This is my least favorite party
this holding so far.

744
00:42:41,976 --> 00:42:46,214
Friends. I'm afraid that I have
some terrible news.

745
00:42:46,231 --> 00:42:48,416
The squirrels are gonna
take over the world!

746
00:42:48,417 --> 00:42:49,457
I knew it!

747
00:42:49,466 --> 00:42:52,593
I always said, squirrels are little
shifty, little guys.

748
00:42:52,594 --> 00:42:54,791
No! We're not doing
this squirrel thing, right now.

749
00:42:54,800 --> 00:42:56,290
That's not... No!

750
00:42:56,693 --> 00:43:00,328
Max is missing!
He's out there, somewhere.

751
00:43:00,337 --> 00:43:03,937
Lost, scared, so, so handsome.

752
00:43:03,950 --> 00:43:06,533
We've got to find him
and bring him home!

753
00:43:06,534 --> 00:43:09,902
But, the outside world is loud
and scary... Whoa!

754
00:43:09,911 --> 00:43:11,020
Is that a hawk?

755
00:43:11,600 --> 00:43:14,630
This is my friend, Tiberius.
He's going to help us.

756
00:43:14,648 --> 00:43:17,439
He's not going to eat us.
We've already been over it.

757
00:43:17,440 --> 00:43:19,582
Come on, Gidget.
We go out there without a leash?

758
00:43:19,591 --> 00:43:22,533
We'll get caught by a net.
Or something worse.

759
00:43:22,542 --> 00:43:24,239
Yeah, like a hawk!

760
00:43:24,240 --> 00:43:27,093
We're wasting time!
Max needs us!

761
00:43:27,120 --> 00:43:29,813
Come on, girl. Max doesn't even
know you're alive.

762
00:43:29,831 --> 00:43:33,813
Well, I don't care. I love him,
I love him with all my heart.

763
00:43:33,822 --> 00:43:37,057
And, I'm gonna go look for Max
no matter who's with me.

764
00:43:37,315 --> 00:43:38,390
So...

765
00:43:38,648 --> 00:43:40,390
Who's with me?

766
00:43:45,600 --> 00:43:47,510
Alright. Fine, fine.

767
00:43:48,568 --> 00:43:52,120
Oh, come on, guys.
I can't believe you.

768
00:43:52,711 --> 00:43:55,083
When I got my claws
caught in the curtains,

769
00:43:55,084 --> 00:43:56,749
Who pulled me down?

770
00:43:56,897 --> 00:43:58,400
Max, did!

771
00:43:58,942 --> 00:44:01,759
Buddy, Mile!
When you were fixed,

772
00:44:01,760 --> 00:44:03,831
Who told you to sit
the comfortable way?

773
00:44:03,848 --> 00:44:06,160
- Max, did.
- Max, did!

774
00:44:06,391 --> 00:44:07,580
Max, did! He did it!

775
00:44:07,884 --> 00:44:10,924
And, when that random cat
tried to eat Sweet Pea,

776
00:44:10,925 --> 00:44:12,675
Who saved him?

777
00:44:12,693 --> 00:44:15,040
It wasn't a random cat,
it was you!

778
00:44:15,377 --> 00:44:17,644
The identity of the random cat
is not the point,

779
00:44:17,645 --> 00:44:20,106
We're talking about
who saved him?

780
00:44:20,124 --> 00:44:21,048
Max, did!

781
00:44:21,049 --> 00:44:24,062
We gotta sive him.
We gotta go save Max!

782
00:44:25,351 --> 00:44:28,311
Yeah! Let's go save Max!

783
00:44:28,471 --> 00:44:31,066
Uhh... Which one is Max, again?

784
00:44:32,550 --> 00:44:34,720
- Hmmm.
- Tiberius!

785
00:44:34,737 --> 00:44:36,800
No! Bad, bad bird!

786
00:44:38,080 --> 00:44:41,831
Nice little guy.
Nice little guy.

787
00:44:41,840 --> 00:44:43,531
I like this, bird.

788
00:44:43,848 --> 00:44:45,530
Crazy bird.

789
00:45:11,217 --> 00:45:12,960
Aahhh!

790
00:45:15,463 --> 00:45:16,631
Ohh!

791
00:45:17,351 --> 00:45:19,866
Come on, we gotta get to shore.

792
00:45:19,893 --> 00:45:23,370
I only do the doggie paddle.
And I don't know it well.

793
00:45:24,080 --> 00:45:26,470
Swim, tiny dog. Swim!

794
00:45:26,640 --> 00:45:27,653
Aww!

795
00:45:36,718 --> 00:45:37,752
Duke!

796
00:45:41,084 --> 00:45:42,453
Help!

797
00:45:48,053 --> 00:45:49,910
Max, grab the ring!

798
00:45:50,391 --> 00:45:51,776
I ca... I can't!

799
00:45:51,777 --> 00:45:53,768
Keep it up, Max! You're doing...

800
00:45:53,786 --> 00:45:56,007
Well, you're not...
You're not doing great.

801
00:45:56,008 --> 00:45:58,238
But, you're not drowning,
and that's something.

802
00:45:58,239 --> 00:45:59,907
Ah! Aww!

803
00:46:05,940 --> 00:46:07,182
You're almost there!

804
00:46:07,191 --> 00:46:08,269
Whoah!

805
00:46:08,270 --> 00:46:09,270
Huh!

806
00:46:16,577 --> 00:46:17,577
Ahh!

807
00:46:19,994 --> 00:46:20,828
Uh!

808
00:46:21,014 --> 00:46:23,931
- Thanks, Duke.
- No problem.

809
00:46:24,257 --> 00:46:26,730
Finally, we're going home.

810
00:46:27,600 --> 00:46:30,530
Uh... Isn't home that way?

811
00:46:31,093 --> 00:46:33,560
Uhh! Seriously?

812
00:46:43,850 --> 00:46:45,271
They're going to Brooklyn.

813
00:46:45,280 --> 00:46:48,017
They say, everyone's
going to Brooklyn these days.

814
00:46:48,035 --> 00:46:49,622
It's makin' a real comeback.

815
00:46:49,623 --> 00:46:52,053
I'm not talking about hipster
real estate trends.

816
00:46:52,121 --> 00:46:54,459
I'm talking about vengeance, Tattoo!

817
00:46:54,559 --> 00:46:56,863
Death is coming to Brooklyn.

818
00:46:56,864 --> 00:47:00,168
And it's got buck teeth,
and a cottontail!

819
00:47:18,870 --> 00:47:20,529
Let's go.

820
00:47:35,670 --> 00:47:36,938
Weee!

821
00:47:39,083 --> 00:47:41,946
- Hey, how are you?
- Hi, how are you?

822
00:47:42,046 --> 00:47:43,410
Enchanté.

823
00:47:43,430 --> 00:47:46,231
Chuck! Chuck! Chuck!
Chuck! Chuck!

824
00:47:46,240 --> 00:47:47,377
Chuck! Chuck!

825
00:47:47,395 --> 00:47:48,740
Yay!!

826
00:48:00,110 --> 00:48:02,506
What is this creepy joint?

827
00:48:02,950 --> 00:48:04,079
This is Pops place.

828
00:48:04,080 --> 00:48:07,182
His owner is never home
so, it's kind of a hotspot.

829
00:48:07,360 --> 00:48:09,617
Pops knows everyone in this city.

830
00:48:09,626 --> 00:48:13,048
If he agrees to help us.
Max is as good as found.

831
00:48:13,066 --> 00:48:15,240
- Cool!
- Oh, fabulous.

832
00:48:48,737 --> 00:48:51,768
- Tell me you got that.
- Oh, have yes I did.

833
00:48:51,786 --> 00:48:53,733
- What's up, Peanut?
- Hey, Buddy.

834
00:48:53,742 --> 00:48:56,900
- You see Pops around here?
- Yeah, he's over there.

835
00:48:58,412 --> 00:48:59,512
Hey, Pops.

836
00:48:59,640 --> 00:49:01,733
- Mushroom and sweet potatos.
- Pops!

837
00:49:01,742 --> 00:49:03,890
Owee! Guys! Who's that? What?

838
00:49:04,480 --> 00:49:06,440
Oh! Hey, Buddy.

839
00:49:07,074 --> 00:49:09,033
How you've been, old timer?

840
00:49:09,226 --> 00:49:10,924
Paralysed.

841
00:49:12,091 --> 00:49:15,664
Great. Listen mr. Pops.
Our friend Max was taken.

842
00:49:15,764 --> 00:49:18,227
Last we heard,
he was lost in the sewers.

843
00:49:18,327 --> 00:49:21,540
Buddy said that maybe
you could help us?

844
00:49:21,696 --> 00:49:25,039
No, I do know a guy
in the sewers, but...

845
00:49:25,040 --> 00:49:27,617
I... I don't go out anymore.

846
00:49:27,870 --> 00:49:29,519
Uh. What a waste of time.

847
00:49:29,520 --> 00:49:30,898
Who said that?

848
00:49:30,899 --> 00:49:33,697
Oh! I said it.
By the way, I meant no offence.

849
00:49:33,790 --> 00:49:35,644
I just...
Have you seen yourself?

850
00:49:35,645 --> 00:49:37,395
Welldy, well, well, well.

851
00:49:37,404 --> 00:49:39,926
Looky what we apparently
have here!

852
00:49:39,927 --> 00:49:42,930
Me see would like
to have a look see.

853
00:49:43,066 --> 00:49:45,013
Myron, brows!

854
00:49:47,465 --> 00:49:48,501
Oh, no.

855
00:49:48,502 --> 00:49:52,206
Oh, yes. Me like what me see.

856
00:49:52,222 --> 00:49:56,210
Well, what me can see,
it's only an an attractive blur.

857
00:49:56,613 --> 00:50:00,370
Little lady, this is my city.
I'll find your friend.

858
00:50:00,477 --> 00:50:02,849
Alright, party is over.

859
00:50:02,850 --> 00:50:04,850
Myron, vacuum!

860
00:50:09,909 --> 00:50:12,842
So, where are you from,
my fuzzy angel?

861
00:50:12,982 --> 00:50:14,728
Dude, I'm a cat.

862
00:50:14,729 --> 00:50:16,720
Well, nobody is perfect.

863
00:50:25,520 --> 00:50:27,585
I'm so hungry.

864
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:33,799
Oh man, would you
look at that sandwich!

865
00:50:33,971 --> 00:50:36,474
Alright, time to work the gift.

866
00:50:44,607 --> 00:50:46,629
No, no, no!

867
00:50:48,160 --> 00:50:49,160
Argh!

868
00:50:50,871 --> 00:50:53,813
Okay. This... This...
This will be fine. We're fine.

869
00:50:53,822 --> 00:50:55,359
We can find our way home.

870
00:50:55,360 --> 00:50:57,804
We're descended from
the mighty wolf.

871
00:50:57,830 --> 00:51:00,034
We've raw primal instincts...

872
00:51:00,035 --> 00:51:03,177
that are mere moments away
from kicking in...

873
00:51:03,440 --> 00:51:04,657
And leading us home.

874
00:51:04,666 --> 00:51:08,010
I can not wait! Here it comes...

875
00:51:09,413 --> 00:51:11,492
- Anything?
- No.

876
00:51:11,493 --> 00:51:13,120
Wait! Aw! I...

877
00:51:13,617 --> 00:51:15,660
Argh! No!

878
00:51:16,300 --> 00:51:17,639
I don't know, Duke.

879
00:51:17,640 --> 00:51:21,324
Maybe the legend of dogs
coming from wolves is just wrong.

880
00:51:21,333 --> 00:51:23,531
I mean like, maybe one puppy
asks his mom,

881
00:51:23,555 --> 00:51:26,023
"Where did we come from?"
and the mom said, "Woof"!

882
00:51:26,024 --> 00:51:27,884
And the kid was like,
"Oh, wolves"!

883
00:51:27,890 --> 00:51:29,483
And she's like, "Yeah, fine".

884
00:51:29,484 --> 00:51:31,480
- Sausage!
- Huh?

885
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:33,271
Do you smell that?

886
00:51:33,690 --> 00:51:37,113
- Oh, man. It is!
- Sausage!

887
00:51:37,279 --> 00:51:39,346
Well then,
what are we waiting for?

888
00:51:39,347 --> 00:51:41,340
We're coming for you, baby!

889
00:51:54,497 --> 00:51:56,910
Lower the ramp, dummy!

890
00:51:57,490 --> 00:51:58,834
Who are they?

891
00:51:59,090 --> 00:52:03,037
This is Puffball, Squashface,
Wiener Dog,

892
00:52:03,048 --> 00:52:06,702
Yellow Bird, Eagle Eye,
Guinea Pig Joe!

893
00:52:06,711 --> 00:52:08,843
And of course
my girlfriend, Ronda!

894
00:52:09,066 --> 00:52:11,278
Ah! 100% percent wrong.

895
00:52:12,351 --> 00:52:13,944
Good enough.

896
00:52:15,120 --> 00:52:17,608
Come on, let's go!
Move it or lose it.

897
00:52:17,700 --> 00:52:22,444
Every bird instinct I have says,
"Don't follow a dog on wheels".

898
00:52:22,460 --> 00:52:24,359
Um... Mr. Pops. Sir...

899
00:52:24,360 --> 00:52:26,737
Shouldn't we be
heading to the sewers?

900
00:52:26,740 --> 00:52:28,417
Now, if we take the human road,

901
00:52:28,426 --> 00:52:29,999
getting there is gonna
take days.

902
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:31,524
You may have lot of time,

903
00:52:31,525 --> 00:52:33,688
but for me, every breath
is a cliffhanger!

904
00:52:33,706 --> 00:52:36,870
So, we gotta take
the secret route.

905
00:52:37,840 --> 00:52:41,320
Okay! The secret route was death.

906
00:52:41,424 --> 00:52:44,148
- Well, that's that, I guess.
- Come on!

907
00:52:46,595 --> 00:52:48,280
Get down here.

908
00:52:52,942 --> 00:52:54,124
Sweet Pea.

909
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:07,270
Keep moving.

910
00:53:18,333 --> 00:53:19,630
Oh, no!

911
00:53:22,422 --> 00:53:24,774
Stop it! Look away!

912
00:54:07,428 --> 00:54:09,865
Come on, I don't have all day.

913
00:54:37,759 --> 00:54:39,653
Come on, slowpokes.

914
00:54:40,160 --> 00:54:41,635
What is that smell?

915
00:54:41,857 --> 00:54:44,257
It's poo-poo
with a dash of caca.

916
00:54:46,030 --> 00:54:47,920
Scent is getting stronger.

917
00:54:51,272 --> 00:54:52,339
Aww!

918
00:54:53,882 --> 00:54:55,266
Oh, man!

919
00:55:00,791 --> 00:55:02,889
Duke, let's eat!

920
00:55:02,890 --> 00:55:04,497
Oh, yes!

921
00:55:13,991 --> 00:55:16,337
Oh, smells so good!

922
00:55:17,631 --> 00:55:19,967
Oh, yeah!

923
00:55:29,130 --> 00:55:30,808
- Sausages!
- Sausages!

924
00:55:52,613 --> 00:55:54,710
Come on, boys!

925
00:55:59,306 --> 00:56:01,875
Holy Schnitzel!

926
00:56:04,570 --> 00:56:06,311
"We go together,."

927
00:56:06,328 --> 00:56:08,909
"Like rama lamma lamma
ka dinga da dinga dong."

928
00:56:08,910 --> 00:56:10,609
"Remembered forever,

929
00:56:10,610 --> 00:56:13,313
"As shoobop sha wadda
wadda yippity boom de boom".

930
00:56:13,314 --> 00:56:15,519
"Chang chang
changitty chang shoobop."

931
00:56:15,520 --> 00:56:19,319
"That's the way it should be."

932
00:56:19,320 --> 00:56:21,573
"Wha-oohh, yeah!"

933
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:23,634
"We're for each other,

934
00:56:23,635 --> 00:56:26,266
"Like a wop ba-ba lu-bop
and wop bam boom".

935
00:56:26,267 --> 00:56:27,990
"Just like my brother is,

936
00:56:27,991 --> 00:56:30,636
"Sha-na-na-na-na-na
yippity dip de doom".

937
00:56:30,637 --> 00:56:32,629
"Chang chang
chanitty chang sha-bop".

938
00:56:32,630 --> 00:56:36,585
"We'll always be together,."

939
00:56:36,586 --> 00:56:38,969
"Wha-oohh, yeah!"

940
00:56:38,970 --> 00:56:46,970
"We'll always be together".

941
00:56:47,421 --> 00:56:49,790
"We'll always..."

942
00:56:55,395 --> 00:56:57,630
You get in a wierd pipe, man.

943
00:57:00,300 --> 00:57:02,817
Alright, now these guys are
a bit testy.

944
00:57:02,844 --> 00:57:04,660
So, just let me do the talking.

945
00:57:04,862 --> 00:57:08,439
Hey, you cry baby!
Where is the Viper at?

946
00:57:15,516 --> 00:57:19,902
Don't you worry, Viper!
You will not be forgotten!

947
00:57:21,137 --> 00:57:23,690
You will be avenged, Viper!

948
00:57:25,240 --> 00:57:26,622
And if you don't believe me,

949
00:57:26,640 --> 00:57:30,204
You can look at my battle plans.
It's all laid out, right here!

950
00:57:32,515 --> 00:57:35,511
Boss. I can't tell thogh what it is.

951
00:57:35,733 --> 00:57:38,000
Well, you have to really
look at it to understand it.

952
00:57:38,026 --> 00:57:40,301
Like, that's you guys
right here. And...

953
00:57:40,302 --> 00:57:41,448
See, that's Brooklyn.

954
00:57:41,680 --> 00:57:43,661
That's where we go get 'em dogs.

955
00:57:43,662 --> 00:57:45,379
Bam! Bam!

956
00:57:48,230 --> 00:57:51,537
That ball of fluff's got
a screw loose. Let's get at 'em.

957
00:57:51,555 --> 00:57:53,320
But, you get it.
You see what I'm sayin'.

958
00:57:53,697 --> 00:57:56,355
Bottom line is, I'm coming
right to you, Tiny Dog.

959
00:57:56,364 --> 00:57:59,360
And that big fat brown dog,
he gonna get it, too.

960
00:57:59,377 --> 00:58:00,444
Tiny Dog?

961
00:58:00,460 --> 00:58:02,133
There're lots of tiny dogs
in the city!

962
00:58:02,150 --> 00:58:05,075
I mean, you're a tiny dog, okay?
So, let's just go.

963
00:58:05,076 --> 00:58:09,297
He also said, big fat brown dog.
Like Max's new roommate.

964
00:58:09,315 --> 00:58:10,612
Not necessarily.

965
00:58:10,613 --> 00:58:13,907
Whoo! Max! Max! Max! Max! Max!

966
00:58:13,911 --> 00:58:15,720
You are gonna get it!

967
00:58:16,160 --> 00:58:18,412
Ahh! That's kinda hard
to hard to dispute.

968
00:58:18,471 --> 00:58:20,951
Hey! You stay away from...

969
00:58:21,608 --> 00:58:23,840
Wait, what? You know, Tiny Dog?

970
00:58:25,377 --> 00:58:26,819
He's my friend!

971
00:58:26,820 --> 00:58:28,820
And some might say my boyfriend!

972
00:58:28,853 --> 00:58:30,640
Uhh... Nobody says that.

973
00:58:30,782 --> 00:58:32,460
I can't beleive you know, Tiny Dog.

974
00:58:32,569 --> 00:58:34,293
Oh man, that's cool!
It's such a small world.

975
00:58:34,294 --> 00:58:36,096
That's the funny thing about it.

976
00:58:36,293 --> 00:58:38,500
- Get 'em!
- Scatter!

977
00:58:44,605 --> 00:58:45,995
Not good.

978
00:58:50,230 --> 00:58:51,475
See you guys, later.

979
00:58:51,490 --> 00:58:52,995
Oh my God!

980
00:58:56,454 --> 00:58:58,416
Everybody, run!

981
00:59:03,182 --> 00:59:06,350
Derick, you idiot!
Did they all get away?

982
00:59:08,142 --> 00:59:10,500
Hewo! That was a close one.

983
00:59:11,617 --> 00:59:13,199
Oh, nuts!

984
00:59:13,200 --> 00:59:15,422
Yes! We got one.

985
00:59:16,053 --> 00:59:17,849
Oh, good for you, guys!

986
00:59:17,850 --> 00:59:19,309
- Yay!
- Ya-hey!

987
00:59:19,310 --> 00:59:22,942
Oh yes, Tiny Dog!
We got your friend!

988
00:59:23,008 --> 00:59:24,747
Advantage me!

989
00:59:26,773 --> 00:59:27,780
Uh-oh!

990
00:59:27,781 --> 00:59:29,780
Just ignore
what just happend, okay?

991
00:59:32,580 --> 00:59:33,733
Yes!

992
00:59:38,309 --> 00:59:39,559
You know what?

993
00:59:39,560 --> 00:59:42,088
I mean, this maybe
the sausage talking...

994
00:59:42,444 --> 00:59:43,688
But, you're okay.

995
00:59:43,706 --> 00:59:45,989
Right back at you, man!

996
00:59:45,990 --> 00:59:48,080
You know, when I met you
I was all like...

997
00:59:48,106 --> 00:59:50,529
"Oh! I don't know if I like him".

998
00:59:50,530 --> 00:59:52,862
But, now that I know you,
I'm like...

999
00:59:52,871 --> 00:59:54,820
"I like him".

1000
00:59:56,521 --> 01:00:00,930
You know, I saw this place.
From the outside. Many times!

1001
01:00:01,130 --> 01:00:05,546
And I know what treasures
are weighted within these walls.

1002
01:00:05,555 --> 01:00:09,020
I would've broke down that door
a long time ago, I tell you.

1003
01:00:09,142 --> 01:00:11,057
What are you talking about?

1004
01:00:11,058 --> 01:00:13,794
My old owner and I
used to live arond here.

1005
01:00:13,822 --> 01:00:17,189
Duke! Man, wait!
Did you used to have an owner?

1006
01:00:17,190 --> 01:00:20,053
Well, It was...
It was a long time ago.

1007
01:00:20,140 --> 01:00:21,625
I don't wanna talk about it.

1008
01:00:21,626 --> 01:00:23,620
Yes, you do. Come on.

1009
01:00:23,880 --> 01:00:25,733
I don't know.

1010
01:00:26,026 --> 01:00:27,730
But, you know what?

1011
01:00:28,416 --> 01:00:30,721
He was so cool.

1012
01:00:30,906 --> 01:00:32,124
Yeah?

1013
01:00:32,657 --> 01:00:35,928
Yeah. He was the best.

1014
01:00:48,924 --> 01:00:50,488
Man, we had fun!

1015
01:00:53,297 --> 01:00:55,200
We play fetch!

1016
01:01:00,862 --> 01:01:02,986
We go for walks.

1017
01:01:04,675 --> 01:01:06,440
We take naps.

1018
01:01:07,413 --> 01:01:09,490
We're both big nappers.

1019
01:01:23,137 --> 01:01:26,850
I got out one night,
chasing a butterfly or a car.

1020
01:01:27,244 --> 01:01:29,764
By the time, I'd caught up
with it and ate it!

1021
01:01:29,765 --> 01:01:30,933
Probably a butterfly, then.

1022
01:01:30,950 --> 01:01:34,219
I realized I was so far away
from my home.

1023
01:01:34,220 --> 01:01:35,680
I couldn't find it.

1024
01:01:36,222 --> 01:01:39,680
Few days later, I was picked up
by animal control.

1025
01:01:42,951 --> 01:01:45,952
I had a great thing going, but...

1026
01:01:46,257 --> 01:01:48,613
I had it go and mess it up.

1027
01:01:50,142 --> 01:01:52,133
Duke, we gotta go to your house!

1028
01:01:52,134 --> 01:01:53,422
Na!

1029
01:01:53,431 --> 01:01:55,527
You know, your owner
is gonna relieved!

1030
01:01:55,528 --> 01:01:56,821
Really?

1031
01:01:57,031 --> 01:01:59,840
Yeah, but...
But, he never came for me.

1032
01:02:00,644 --> 01:02:01,900
Maybe he...

1033
01:02:02,961 --> 01:02:04,705
Maybe he didn't like me.

1034
01:02:05,031 --> 01:02:07,974
Hey, of course he liked you.
He was your owner!

1035
01:02:07,991 --> 01:02:10,417
I mean, he's probably worried sick.

1036
01:02:10,826 --> 01:02:11,928
I don't know.

1037
01:02:11,937 --> 01:02:14,080
Well, I do know and we're going.

1038
01:02:14,081 --> 01:02:17,117
Your owner is gonna freak.
I'm freaking out just thinking about it!

1039
01:02:19,733 --> 01:02:22,450
Okay. Let's do it.

1040
01:02:22,915 --> 01:02:24,130
Here they are.

1041
01:02:24,604 --> 01:02:26,480
Alright, doggie, come on.

1042
01:02:28,020 --> 01:02:28,951
Hey! Hey! Hey!

1043
01:02:28,960 --> 01:02:31,074
Hey! Where you think
you're going?

1044
01:02:31,075 --> 01:02:33,069
Come back here, you dogs!

1045
01:02:33,070 --> 01:02:35,070
Aahhh!

1046
01:02:44,631 --> 01:02:47,279
That rabbit. He has crazy eyes.

1047
01:02:47,280 --> 01:02:49,883
There ain't no curing
was wrong with that thing!

1048
01:02:49,893 --> 01:02:52,382
Gidget, here's an idea,

1049
01:02:52,400 --> 01:02:56,613
Maybe there's a dog in
the neighborhood that looks like Max.

1050
01:02:56,620 --> 01:02:58,559
Start hanging out with him,

1051
01:02:58,560 --> 01:03:01,561
after a while you'll think it's him,
you'll be done.

1052
01:03:01,973 --> 01:03:03,812
We're not just giving up!

1053
01:03:03,813 --> 01:03:05,663
We're dedicated, we're loyal,

1054
01:03:05,664 --> 01:03:07,401
We're easly the greatest
pet ever,

1055
01:03:07,422 --> 01:03:08,728
We're dogs!

1056
01:03:08,737 --> 01:03:10,302
- Cat.
- Hawk.

1057
01:03:11,020 --> 01:03:13,172
Well, Congratulations,
today you're dogs

1058
01:03:13,173 --> 01:03:14,608
whether you like it or not.

1059
01:03:14,622 --> 01:03:15,813
Sweet!

1060
01:03:15,822 --> 01:03:18,544
Now, let's find Max
before that rabbit does.

1061
01:03:18,545 --> 01:03:20,714
Right! We're dogs!

1062
01:03:36,220 --> 01:03:38,364
Yep! They were here.

1063
01:03:38,382 --> 01:03:39,599
Excellent.

1064
01:03:39,600 --> 01:03:40,951
We're closing in.

1065
01:03:40,960 --> 01:03:43,591
This is a groundbreaking
evil behavior, people.

1066
01:03:43,848 --> 01:03:45,155
Groundbreaking.

1067
01:03:54,649 --> 01:03:56,750
Light pop just now
from my brain.

1068
01:03:56,888 --> 01:03:58,750
The bunny has an idea.

1069
01:04:02,007 --> 01:04:04,019
Okay. So, how do I look?

1070
01:04:04,020 --> 01:04:05,271
You look great.

1071
01:04:06,524 --> 01:04:07,714
How do I smell?

1072
01:04:07,715 --> 01:04:10,530
Like a dog, Duke. Relax, man.

1073
01:04:13,386 --> 01:04:14,815
There it is!

1074
01:04:18,184 --> 01:04:21,721
Well, go on up.
Go scratch that door.

1075
01:04:26,648 --> 01:04:29,890
Remember that sausage factory?
That was fun, huh?

1076
01:04:30,311 --> 01:04:31,839
Are you stalling?

1077
01:04:31,840 --> 01:04:34,221
No, why do you think that?

1078
01:04:34,613 --> 01:04:37,333
Let's have a walk talk
about why you think I'm stalling.

1079
01:04:37,351 --> 01:04:39,305
Duke, you have nothing
to be nervous about.

1080
01:04:39,306 --> 01:04:41,300
You're owner is gonna be
thrilled to see you.

1081
01:04:44,190 --> 01:04:45,190
Okay.

1082
01:04:49,100 --> 01:04:51,813
Huh! That car's new!

1083
01:04:59,617 --> 01:05:01,220
Can I help you?

1084
01:05:03,751 --> 01:05:05,849
No, we're good, thanks.

1085
01:05:05,850 --> 01:05:07,991
You're not good. You look dirty.

1086
01:05:08,008 --> 01:05:10,390
And I'm gonna have to ask you
to get off my lawn

1087
01:05:10,391 --> 01:05:11,903
before I get... Um...

1088
01:05:12,186 --> 01:05:13,759
You know, what you have.

1089
01:05:13,760 --> 01:05:15,760
This is my lawn!

1090
01:05:15,786 --> 01:05:17,559
Duke, maybe we shoyld go.

1091
01:05:17,560 --> 01:05:20,373
And, why...
Why would Fred get a cat?

1092
01:05:20,391 --> 01:05:21,901
He hates cats.

1093
01:05:21,902 --> 01:05:23,899
It's one of things
I love about him.

1094
01:05:23,900 --> 01:05:26,222
Fred? The old guy?

1095
01:05:26,755 --> 01:05:28,133
He... Um...

1096
01:05:29,457 --> 01:05:31,200
He died.

1097
01:05:32,790 --> 01:05:35,457
Duke, maybe I made a mistake
saying we should come here.

1098
01:05:35,475 --> 01:05:37,040
Let... Let's go.

1099
01:05:37,044 --> 01:05:40,620
You're a lair.
Max, cats lie all the time.

1100
01:05:41,128 --> 01:05:42,620
Don't faff for it!

1101
01:05:48,008 --> 01:05:49,330
Who are they?

1102
01:05:52,755 --> 01:05:55,560
Hey! This is my home! Go away!

1103
01:06:00,620 --> 01:06:02,657
Duke! It's time to go.

1104
01:06:04,364 --> 01:06:08,222
Duke, let's go, come on!
This isn't your home anymore.

1105
01:06:08,240 --> 01:06:10,583
Why did you bring me here, Max?

1106
01:06:10,584 --> 01:06:12,852
Wait a minute. This is my fault?

1107
01:06:12,871 --> 01:06:14,346
You know, I was trying
to help you!

1108
01:06:14,347 --> 01:06:17,022
You were trying
to get rid of me!

1109
01:06:18,035 --> 01:06:20,194
Yeah, you know what, Duke?
I don't need this.

1110
01:06:20,195 --> 01:06:22,190
Um... See you later.

1111
01:06:23,743 --> 01:06:25,738
Whoa! Whoa!
Come on, settle down!

1112
01:06:28,897 --> 01:06:30,480
Go home, Max!

1113
01:06:31,848 --> 01:06:33,581
Hey! Help me out here!

1114
01:06:33,582 --> 01:06:35,580
Hold on, I'm coming!

1115
01:06:36,426 --> 01:06:37,580
Let's move!

1116
01:06:38,555 --> 01:06:40,346
Finally get you, big fella.

1117
01:06:40,347 --> 01:06:41,348
Whoa! Come on!

1118
01:06:41,688 --> 01:06:43,340
This is it for you!

1119
01:06:50,133 --> 01:06:51,220
Duke!

1120
01:07:32,769 --> 01:07:34,017
Tiny Dog!

1121
01:07:36,260 --> 01:07:38,142
Oh! Are you kidding me?

1122
01:07:38,672 --> 01:07:40,740
You thought this was over, Tiny Dog?

1123
01:07:52,231 --> 01:07:54,603
Jab! Jab! Jab!
Body blow! Body blow!

1124
01:07:54,604 --> 01:07:56,970
- Karate chop to your neck!
- Would you...

1125
01:07:57,656 --> 01:08:00,131
Would you get off me?

1126
01:08:01,761 --> 01:08:02,761
Tattoo!

1127
01:08:05,217 --> 01:08:07,600
No, no, no, no!

1128
01:08:12,761 --> 01:08:16,208
Oh, T.D. This kills me to say,

1129
01:08:16,209 --> 01:08:18,200
But, we gotta join forces, man!

1130
01:08:31,013 --> 01:08:33,192
We make a great team, Tiny Dog!

1131
01:08:33,193 --> 01:08:35,524
Well, mainly I'm doing
all the hard work.

1132
01:08:35,525 --> 01:08:36,595
But you're helping.

1133
01:08:36,622 --> 01:08:38,762
Yes, yes. Fine.
Just keep your eyes on the road.

1134
01:08:38,763 --> 01:08:40,604
You're driving like an animal!

1135
01:08:43,920 --> 01:08:45,110
What was that?

1136
01:08:45,111 --> 01:08:46,442
Oh, that was a pothole.

1137
01:08:46,443 --> 01:08:48,302
You're hitting things on purpose?

1138
01:08:48,346 --> 01:08:50,657
You know, you know me, too L.T.D.

1139
01:08:50,731 --> 01:08:52,812
Always keeping me in check.

1140
01:09:00,453 --> 01:09:01,634
Do you see the van?

1141
01:09:01,635 --> 01:09:04,290
Yeah, I see it.
We're about to hit it.

1142
01:09:30,008 --> 01:09:31,901
Relax Snowball, I got you.

1143
01:09:31,902 --> 01:09:33,523
There he is!

1144
01:09:33,524 --> 01:09:35,756
He's got Snowball!

1145
01:09:52,373 --> 01:09:55,699
Look, fellas.
This is not what it looks like.

1146
01:09:55,700 --> 01:09:57,306
Shhh you!

1147
01:09:58,791 --> 01:10:00,959
You are gonna eat the boss!

1148
01:10:00,960 --> 01:10:03,244
No, no, no. Snowball and I
are the same side, now!

1149
01:10:03,262 --> 01:10:05,290
Can you tell 'em, Snowball?
Tell them!

1150
01:10:05,591 --> 01:10:09,350
That raccoon is lying.
He's not the president.

1151
01:10:11,191 --> 01:10:13,660
Uh... I... I...

1152
01:10:14,071 --> 01:10:15,160
I...

1153
01:10:15,493 --> 01:10:17,022
Come on, now.

1154
01:10:28,308 --> 01:10:29,308
Gidget!

1155
01:11:04,670 --> 01:11:05,811
Go, Max!

1156
01:11:05,812 --> 01:11:09,015
Right! Okay, I gotta go.
Thank you! Thank you!

1157
01:11:10,423 --> 01:11:12,186
Stay down!

1158
01:11:26,207 --> 01:11:28,101
Duke, hang on!

1159
01:11:29,202 --> 01:11:31,371
Whoa! Whoah!

1160
01:11:43,416 --> 01:11:45,618
- Duke!
- Max! Max!

1161
01:11:45,635 --> 01:11:47,052
Oh! Okay, get the keys!

1162
01:11:47,053 --> 01:11:48,388
- Right!
- Hurry!

1163
01:12:21,559 --> 01:12:22,989
Come on! Come on!

1164
01:12:23,422 --> 01:12:24,675
I got 'em!

1165
01:12:28,373 --> 01:12:29,560
Max!

1166
01:13:03,770 --> 01:13:06,640
Remember me!

1167
01:13:58,680 --> 01:14:01,768
I feel heroic and handsome!

1168
01:14:02,094 --> 01:14:05,452
A ittle wet, but
I still look good! I look good!

1169
01:14:11,064 --> 01:14:13,429
Are you... Are you okay?

1170
01:14:13,977 --> 01:14:16,342
I'm good. I'm good.

1171
01:14:17,970 --> 01:14:20,666
Thanks for coming
to save me, Max.

1172
01:14:21,570 --> 01:14:23,016
Yay!

1173
01:14:23,017 --> 01:14:25,678
Max! Oh-hoh! Max!

1174
01:14:32,153 --> 01:14:33,731
You need a lift?

1175
01:14:34,076 --> 01:14:37,492
Yes, we need a lift!
Let's go, Tattoo!

1176
01:14:42,586 --> 01:14:43,830
Taxi!

1177
01:14:44,915 --> 01:14:45,990
Whoa!!

1178
01:15:03,475 --> 01:15:06,749
Hey! Hey! Uh, Gidget! Wait up!

1179
01:15:06,750 --> 01:15:09,502
- Oh! Hi, Max!
- Yeah, hi. Um..

1180
01:15:09,520 --> 01:15:11,110
Play it cool!

1181
01:15:12,168 --> 01:15:15,537
Yeah, I have...
I, I, I... I just wanted to...

1182
01:15:16,471 --> 01:15:17,625
Look.

1183
01:15:18,391 --> 01:15:20,967
Have you ever lived across
from someone your whole life...

1184
01:15:21,200 --> 01:15:24,370
But, you... But, you don't really
appreciate them until...

1185
01:15:24,790 --> 01:15:26,195
I don't know, until...

1186
01:15:26,213 --> 01:15:29,360
They're beating up a dozens
of animals on the Brooklyn bridge.

1187
01:15:29,502 --> 01:15:31,777
I guess, what I'm tryning
to say is...

1188
01:15:31,778 --> 01:15:33,519
If you ever wanna...

1189
01:15:33,520 --> 01:15:34,280
Okay.

1190
01:15:34,293 --> 01:15:36,265
Oh, great! You're in love.

1191
01:15:36,266 --> 01:15:38,951
How gross for everyone.
Now, move it!

1192
01:15:38,960 --> 01:15:40,586
- Good bye! See you later, Max!
- Good bye.

1193
01:15:40,604 --> 01:15:42,287
Does anyone know where we are?

1194
01:15:42,288 --> 01:15:44,657
- Bye, Max!
- Bye, Gidget.

1195
01:15:44,826 --> 01:15:47,244
- Okay, Bye-bye!
- See you, guys!

1196
01:15:47,951 --> 01:15:50,128
Man, I feel sorry for them.

1197
01:15:50,129 --> 01:15:52,119
Gotta run home to thier owners!

1198
01:15:52,120 --> 01:15:53,117
Not us!

1199
01:15:53,118 --> 01:15:56,334
Now, is back to our primary mission!

1200
01:15:56,335 --> 01:15:59,071
The downfall of the human race!

1201
01:15:59,368 --> 01:16:01,030
It is on, humans!

1202
01:16:01,031 --> 01:16:03,030
It is on!

1203
01:16:05,448 --> 01:16:08,124
Mommy! Can I have a bunny?

1204
01:16:09,200 --> 01:16:11,937
And a pig, and a crocodile
and a lizard?

1205
01:16:15,350 --> 01:16:15,893
Uh-oh!

1206
01:16:15,911 --> 01:16:18,049
Yay! Bunny!

1207
01:16:18,050 --> 01:16:20,526
Jab! Jab! Jab!
Body blow! Body blow!

1208
01:16:20,702 --> 01:16:22,142
Break away move!

1209
01:16:23,150 --> 01:16:25,235
Uh... What's going on?
What's she doing?

1210
01:16:25,368 --> 01:16:28,434
Bunny, I'm gonna love you
forever and ever, and ever!

1211
01:16:30,720 --> 01:16:32,750
Aww! Bunny!

1212
01:18:06,648 --> 01:18:08,000
Here you go.

1213
01:18:48,207 --> 01:18:50,827
Duke, This's the best part
of the day!

1214
01:18:51,497 --> 01:18:54,868
- Oh, is that her?
- Na, no. That's... Wait...

1215
01:18:55,097 --> 01:18:57,090
Yeah, she... That's her.
That's her!

1216
01:18:58,217 --> 01:19:00,045
- Katie!
- Katie!

1217
01:19:00,514 --> 01:19:01,779
There they are!

1218
01:19:01,780 --> 01:19:04,251
Max and Duke. Duke and Max.

1219
01:19:04,434 --> 01:19:06,800
Aww! My boys!

1220
01:19:07,291 --> 01:19:09,474
So, how'd it go? Great, right?

1221
01:19:09,497 --> 01:19:12,194
I... Uhh...

1222
01:19:13,408 --> 01:19:15,599
So, maybe a few box.

1223
01:19:15,600 --> 01:19:18,205
But, I knew this is gonna work out.

1224
01:19:18,738 --> 01:19:19,628
So...

1225
01:19:19,630 --> 01:19:21,142
Who's hungry?

1226
01:19:33,350 --> 01:19:35,072
Welcome home, Duke.

1227
01:19:35,760 --> 01:19:37,422
Thanks, Max.

1228
01:20:48,755 --> 01:20:50,560
Come on, man! Hurry it up!

1229
01:20:51,253 --> 01:20:54,200
Okay! I'm coming! I'm coming!

1230
01:20:58,880 --> 01:21:00,600
Welcome, my dogs!

1231
01:21:00,835 --> 01:21:02,599
Oh, you guys look weird!

1232
01:21:02,600 --> 01:21:04,043
Hurry up! Come on in!

1233
01:21:09,120 --> 01:21:11,379
You siad it was a costume party!

1234
01:21:11,380 --> 01:21:13,018
Why do you listen to me?

1235
