1
00:00:27,458 --> 00:00:29,263
Look out!

2
00:01:00,290 --> 00:01:02,561
Hey! Trying to work here!

3
00:01:03,527 --> 00:01:05,623
Perhaps you could work a little faster.

4
00:01:05,703 --> 00:01:08,505
Perhaps if you hadn't tripped the damn alarm.

5
00:01:10,867 --> 00:01:14,058
Pamela, we are out of time.
The police will be here soon.

6
00:01:14,138 --> 00:01:15,961
Or worse...

7
00:01:16,641 --> 00:01:18,763
Batman, I know, I know!

8
00:01:18,843 --> 00:01:23,095
But it's like trying to find
a needle in a... haystack.

9
00:01:27,584 --> 00:01:30,222
Come on, come on.

10
00:01:34,959 --> 00:01:36,463
Bingo.

11
00:03:26,170 --> 00:03:28,258
Nothing was physically stolen.

12
00:03:28,338 --> 00:03:29,785
Obviously.

13
00:03:29,865 --> 00:03:33,500
There was no effort to minimize
collateral. This was about information.

14
00:03:33,580 --> 00:03:37,502
There's no way Poison Ivy could've
accessed S.T.A.R. Labs' secure data.

15
00:03:37,582 --> 00:03:39,369
Got it.

16
00:03:39,449 --> 00:03:43,456
Here's the file they copied. Looks like
this is the only thing they cared about.

17
00:03:45,489 --> 00:03:48,445
- Oh, no.
- Holland.

18
00:03:48,525 --> 00:03:51,883
"Holland." Why does that sound so familiar?

19
00:03:51,963 --> 00:03:53,833
Be my guest.

20
00:03:59,135 --> 00:04:01,859
Alec Holland was working
on a bio-restorative formula...

21
00:04:01,939 --> 00:04:04,388
...to turn deserts into forests.

22
00:04:06,342 --> 00:04:09,234
Until a saboteur's bomb destroyed that dream.

23
00:04:10,314 --> 00:04:13,269
His body engulfed in the burning
experimental compound...

24
00:04:13,349 --> 00:04:15,605
...Holland tried to douse the flames.

25
00:04:15,685 --> 00:04:18,343
The chemicals reacted
with the surrounding bayou.

26
00:04:18,423 --> 00:04:21,094
His entire physiognomy changed.

27
00:04:21,559 --> 00:04:24,314
- Holland was transformed into...
- Swamp Thing.

28
00:04:24,394 --> 00:04:26,651
That's it! That's what attacked me.

29
00:04:26,731 --> 00:04:28,533
Not quite.

30
00:04:30,134 --> 00:04:33,878
This is Jason Woodrue, aka the Floronic Man.

31
00:04:33,958 --> 00:04:38,229
Terrific. Poison Ivy teaming up
with Jason Woodrue.

32
00:04:38,309 --> 00:04:39,996
We're in for a ride.

33
00:04:40,076 --> 00:04:42,198
I see two immediate objectives.

34
00:04:42,278 --> 00:04:44,150
If you'll excuse us.

35
00:04:47,118 --> 00:04:50,107
A, figure out what Ivy
and Woodrue were up to.

36
00:04:50,187 --> 00:04:52,910
And B, find out where
the green team is hiding out.

37
00:04:52,990 --> 00:04:56,080
I'll take A. I have a hunch
I need to look into.

38
00:04:56,160 --> 00:05:00,850
You take B. Check previous
addresses, known associates.

39
00:05:00,930 --> 00:05:03,720
- Oh, crap.
- Right.

40
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:05,820
We need Harley Quinn.

41
00:05:05,900 --> 00:05:09,427
Last I heard, Harley went off the grid
after she got out on parole.

42
00:05:09,507 --> 00:05:12,530
No one's heard a thing since.
Rumor is she's gone straight...

43
00:05:12,610 --> 00:05:16,249
- ...but also, just plain gone.
- No one disappears without a trace.

44
00:05:16,329 --> 00:05:18,943
Someone knows something. Someone always does.

45
00:05:19,023 --> 00:05:22,055
It's just a matter of shaking the right tree.

46
00:05:27,308 --> 00:05:30,314
Hey, thanks again for helping us out
with that League of Assassins thing...

47
00:05:30,394 --> 00:05:32,431
...in Nanda Parbat.

48
00:05:33,130 --> 00:05:35,785
Oof. That Lady Shiva.

49
00:05:35,865 --> 00:05:39,304
Wouldn't say no to a slice of that pie,
you know what I mean?

50
00:05:42,906 --> 00:05:44,961
So, what can I do for you, Batman?

51
00:05:45,041 --> 00:05:48,433
A lot going on today,
but I can spare a few minutes.

52
00:05:48,513 --> 00:05:51,668
A man was abducted
from his home two days ago.

53
00:05:51,748 --> 00:05:53,552
Harold Goldblum.

54
00:05:54,484 --> 00:05:58,042
Stupid hand. Henderson!

55
00:05:58,122 --> 00:06:01,612
How do you even know about that?
We've got a total media lockdown.

56
00:06:01,692 --> 00:06:05,071
Let's just say I've got eyes
and ears everywhere, Sarge.

57
00:06:05,151 --> 00:06:09,267
Hacking the A.R.G.U.S. computer
is a federal crime, Batman.

58
00:06:09,667 --> 00:06:13,691
Goldblum is a former professor
of chemistry at Metropolis University.

59
00:06:13,771 --> 00:06:17,862
Spent 15 years heading up
GothCorp Chemicals' R&D division.

60
00:06:17,942 --> 00:06:20,296
Most recently, he's been
working for the NSA...

61
00:06:20,376 --> 00:06:22,866
...specializing in biological warfare.

62
00:06:22,946 --> 00:06:26,804
He was their top mind in biology,
botany and toxicology.

63
00:06:26,884 --> 00:06:29,522
I need to know what he was working on.

64
00:06:30,087 --> 00:06:32,042
That'll be all, Henderson.

65
00:06:32,122 --> 00:06:35,326
Right, Sarge. Big fan.

66
00:06:37,395 --> 00:06:40,584
I'm sorry, Batman, that's classified.

67
00:06:40,664 --> 00:06:42,109
My hands are tied.

68
00:06:42,189 --> 00:06:44,788
Strange that you would put it just that way.

69
00:06:44,868 --> 00:06:46,778
- Why?
- A fringe hacker group...

70
00:06:46,858 --> 00:06:50,460
...recently accessed information
about key A.R.G.U.S. employees.

71
00:06:50,540 --> 00:06:53,864
Some of them seem to be engaged
in, shall we say...

72
00:06:53,944 --> 00:06:56,568
...questionable nocturnal activities.

73
00:06:57,248 --> 00:06:59,113
Are you blackmailing me?

74
00:06:59,193 --> 00:07:01,738
I'm explaining
that I can help stop a crime...

75
00:07:01,818 --> 00:07:04,290
...in exchange for some information.

76
00:07:05,321 --> 00:07:10,814
Fine. But for the record, what Mistress
Ilsa does for me is considered therapy...

77
00:07:10,894 --> 00:07:13,117
...in some countries.

78
00:07:13,197 --> 00:07:17,221
It's an odd case. No ransom demands,
political requests, nothing.

79
00:07:17,301 --> 00:07:20,458
He just vanished. Whoever took
the guy, they either killed him...

80
00:07:20,538 --> 00:07:23,627
...or they're keeping him alive
for reason or reasons unknown.

81
00:07:23,707 --> 00:07:25,930
- Any leads?
- Nothing viable.

82
00:07:26,010 --> 00:07:28,415
The investigation is at a dead end.

83
00:07:29,613 --> 00:07:31,901
Goldblum's field of expertise...

84
00:07:31,981 --> 00:07:34,992
...is man-made, pandemic terrorist attacks.

85
00:07:35,072 --> 00:07:39,195
Anthrax, Ebola,
flesh-eating bacteria, you know?

86
00:07:39,275 --> 00:07:41,112
Yes, I do.

87
00:07:41,192 --> 00:07:45,182
In fact, he's the world's
leading expert on the subject.

88
00:07:45,262 --> 00:07:48,152
Jesus, the stuff that guy knows.

89
00:07:48,232 --> 00:07:52,272
I don't mean to be callous,
a part of me hopes they just kill them.

90
00:07:59,182 --> 00:08:01,198
- No, sorry.
- Uh-uh.

91
00:08:01,278 --> 00:08:04,071
- Nah, man.
- Mmm, no.

92
00:08:04,151 --> 00:08:07,124
- Haven't seen her.
- I would've liked to.

93
00:08:07,204 --> 00:08:11,532
Dame owes me three weeks' back rent! If you
find her, you tell her she can eat my...

94
00:08:11,612 --> 00:08:14,912
She had...

95
00:08:14,992 --> 00:08:17,081
...the cutest smile.

96
00:08:17,161 --> 00:08:20,516
Morty, that was your niece, Irene!

97
00:08:20,596 --> 00:08:24,422
Always saying she looks like this
Harley Quinn, but I don't see it.

98
00:08:24,502 --> 00:08:28,224
And an adorable tuchus.

99
00:08:28,304 --> 00:08:29,413
Morty!

100
00:08:29,493 --> 00:08:32,109
- Hasn't been around.
- Afraid not, my son.

101
00:08:32,189 --> 00:08:34,571
- Lo siento.
- Can I have that picture?

102
00:08:34,651 --> 00:08:37,434
It was at that deli...

103
00:08:37,514 --> 00:08:39,169
...on 3rd Street.

104
00:08:39,249 --> 00:08:42,005
Morty, that was two years ago...

105
00:08:42,085 --> 00:08:44,193
...in Miami!

106
00:08:47,106 --> 00:08:49,879
I could go for a Reuben myself about now.

107
00:08:49,959 --> 00:08:51,647
With extra kraut.

108
00:08:54,031 --> 00:08:55,902
Hang on.

109
00:09:25,963 --> 00:09:28,986
Okay, we got one Power Girl jumbo combo...

110
00:09:29,066 --> 00:09:32,255
...one Black Canary leg
and thigh, with coleslaw.

111
00:09:32,335 --> 00:09:34,806
Gonna lose that hand, pudding.

112
00:09:41,811 --> 00:09:44,368
Anything else for you today, boys?

113
00:09:44,448 --> 00:09:46,470
- Uh, no.
- I'm good.

114
00:09:46,550 --> 00:09:49,555
Yeah, me, too. Totally good.

115
00:09:50,808 --> 00:09:53,444
Crazy broad broke my freaking arm.

116
00:09:53,524 --> 00:09:57,130
Hey, Chet, this crazy broad
broke my freaking arm!

117
00:10:02,565 --> 00:10:04,369
Got to be her.

118
00:11:16,373 --> 00:11:18,777
Come on out. I know you're there.

119
00:11:20,945 --> 00:11:22,666
I got good ears.

120
00:11:22,746 --> 00:11:25,269
Your hearing gets mighty sharp in Arkham.

121
00:11:25,349 --> 00:11:27,407
Things go bump in the night.

122
00:11:27,487 --> 00:11:30,446
Hi, Harley. Long time no see.

123
00:11:30,526 --> 00:11:32,624
I'd like to keep it that way.

124
00:11:33,390 --> 00:11:35,579
You're a hard girl to find.

125
00:11:35,659 --> 00:11:38,581
Pretty clever,
hiding in plain sight like that.

126
00:11:38,661 --> 00:11:43,418
I have a few questions. For example,
where can I find your BFF Poison Ivy?

127
00:11:47,704 --> 00:11:50,084
We need your help. Ivy is...

128
00:11:50,164 --> 00:11:53,529
Save it, honey. I don't mix it up
with the costume crowd anymore.

129
00:11:53,609 --> 00:11:55,596
I turned over a new leaf, as it were.

130
00:11:55,676 --> 00:11:58,886
Listen, Ivy's fallen in with the wrong crowd.

131
00:11:58,966 --> 00:12:02,555
She and Jason Woodrue are up to
something, and we have to stop them.

132
00:12:02,635 --> 00:12:04,825
They're a lethal combo, Harley.

133
00:12:04,905 --> 00:12:09,078
Lots of people could get hurt or killed.
Ivy could get hurt or killed.

134
00:12:09,158 --> 00:12:12,448
Nuh-uh. I am done with capes
and tights and masks.

135
00:12:12,528 --> 00:12:15,025
Just trying like hell to lead a normal life.

136
00:12:15,105 --> 00:12:18,989
Really? Funny that you're not, say
using your psychiatric training...

137
00:12:19,069 --> 00:12:20,490
...to make a decent living...

138
00:12:20,570 --> 00:12:24,461
...instead of dressing up in skimpy red
and black for a minimum wage, plus tips.

139
00:12:24,541 --> 00:12:27,031
Pretty weird way to kick a habit.

140
00:12:27,111 --> 00:12:29,999
You've got to be just itching
to get back in the game.

141
00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:33,492
Nice try, but you're on your own, Nightwig.

142
00:12:34,517 --> 00:12:37,374
You haven't reported
to your parole officer in months.

143
00:12:37,454 --> 00:12:40,543
I should just drag your crazy ass
back to jail right now.

144
00:12:40,623 --> 00:12:44,863
Oh, yeah? Just freaking try, you butt-wipe!

145
00:12:58,142 --> 00:13:02,031
Sorry, kiddo, but you're getting the payback
for every pinch, goose and butt-slap...

146
00:13:02,111 --> 00:13:04,516
...I've gotten for the last three months.

147
00:13:30,074 --> 00:13:31,729
Give up?

148
00:13:31,809 --> 00:13:35,646
Just when things are getting
interesting? Fat chance!

149
00:13:49,425 --> 00:13:50,962
Whip.

150
00:13:58,318 --> 00:14:00,756
Ready to call it a night, Harley?

151
00:14:09,512 --> 00:14:12,118
What's so funny, Chuckles?

152
00:14:20,857 --> 00:14:22,862
Some girls like mace.

153
00:14:23,392 --> 00:14:26,382
I prefer a little low-grain Joker venom.

154
00:14:26,462 --> 00:14:29,735
Only useful thing
I ever got from that ass-hat.

155
00:14:36,739 --> 00:14:39,411
Nighty-night, jerk.

156
00:14:52,189 --> 00:14:54,077
Don't know what you expect to find.

157
00:14:54,157 --> 00:14:57,125
My best people have been
over this place a dozen times.

158
00:15:01,731 --> 00:15:05,437
No offense to your best people...
but they're not me.

159
00:15:15,578 --> 00:15:17,366
What is it?

160
00:15:17,446 --> 00:15:19,702
Oh, yay, a leaf.

161
00:15:19,782 --> 00:15:21,604
Kind of like all of these.

162
00:15:21,684 --> 00:15:24,074
No, not like those.

163
00:15:24,154 --> 00:15:27,407
It's a completely different phylum
from every other leaf in here.

164
00:15:27,487 --> 00:15:30,980
Great, you're the world's
greatest florist, too.

165
00:15:31,060 --> 00:15:34,884
Look closely.
Have you ever seen a leaf like this?

166
00:15:35,364 --> 00:15:39,439
- Can't say that I have.
- That's because it isn't from our planet.

167
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:41,557
Not even from our dimension.

168
00:15:42,605 --> 00:15:45,696
Wait, you mean Jason Woodrue?

169
00:15:45,776 --> 00:15:49,165
That freak was here? This is bad.

170
00:15:49,245 --> 00:15:51,368
Your forensic people are bad.

171
00:15:51,448 --> 00:15:54,487
This... is catastrophic.

172
00:15:55,608 --> 00:15:59,776
Nightwing, this is Batman.
Come in. Nightwing?

173
00:15:59,856 --> 00:16:02,999
- Everything okay?
- He should've reported in by now.

174
00:16:03,079 --> 00:16:06,083
You want me to send out a search team?
They're the best that...

175
00:16:06,163 --> 00:16:08,247
Well, they're pretty good.

176
00:16:08,327 --> 00:16:11,471
Like I said, eyes and ears everywhere.

177
00:16:11,551 --> 00:16:15,036
Besides... Nightwing can handle himself.

178
00:16:18,943 --> 00:16:22,583
I know, I know, freaking stupid.
Bringing him back to my place.

179
00:16:22,663 --> 00:16:25,069
But what was I supposed to do?
I couldn't just let him go.

180
00:16:25,149 --> 00:16:29,806
He knows the secret location of my
hidey-hole. He'd blab to Batman for sure.

181
00:16:29,886 --> 00:16:32,409
Could've just killed him, dumbass.

182
00:16:32,489 --> 00:16:36,779
Nah, I'm not a criminal anymore.
Plus, he's kind of too cute to kill.

183
00:16:36,859 --> 00:16:39,415
And anyway, maybe I should help out.

184
00:16:39,495 --> 00:16:42,652
Sounds like Ivy could be
in some serious trouble.

185
00:16:43,032 --> 00:16:46,557
Don't bother yelling for help.
This dump is condemned.

186
00:16:46,637 --> 00:16:50,193
Nobody in the whole building
but us, Nightwig.

187
00:16:50,273 --> 00:16:53,002
- "Wing."
- Eh?

188
00:16:53,642 --> 00:16:55,865
It's Nightwing.

189
00:16:55,945 --> 00:16:59,844
Really? Guess I was thinking of
that goofy mullet you used to have.

190
00:16:59,924 --> 00:17:02,739
Yeesh. That was like
a whole decade of bad-hair days.

191
00:17:02,819 --> 00:17:07,120
Sticks and stones, lady. I've taken
trash talk from bigger criminals than you.

192
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:10,213
"Criminals"? If you hadn't noticed,
I went straight.

193
00:17:10,293 --> 00:17:12,028
I'm a freaking waitress already.

194
00:17:12,108 --> 00:17:15,367
Oh, golly, that's right, I stand corrected.

195
00:17:18,003 --> 00:17:21,591
Check this out, smart guy.
My pile of rejection letters.

196
00:17:21,671 --> 00:17:24,293
Evidently, the Mayo Clinic's
got some dumb policy...

197
00:17:24,373 --> 00:17:27,164
...of not hiring former
costume super-villains.

198
00:17:27,244 --> 00:17:30,034
Just like every other hospital in the world.

199
00:17:30,114 --> 00:17:32,115
There are other jobs.

200
00:17:32,195 --> 00:17:34,571
Oh, sure. I got a ton of offers.

201
00:17:34,651 --> 00:17:38,275
"We got a very special role for you
in Bad Girls After Dark."

202
00:17:38,355 --> 00:17:39,675
And you got to love this one.

203
00:17:39,755 --> 00:17:44,683
"A tasteful pictorial to be shot
in Thailand for legal reasons."

204
00:17:47,296 --> 00:17:50,220
You say I'm a criminal, they say I'm a whore.

205
00:17:50,300 --> 00:17:53,639
Well, I'm sick of other people
telling me what I am!

206
00:17:55,738 --> 00:17:57,328
Whatever.

207
00:17:57,808 --> 00:18:01,030
Got to say, you gave me a heck of a workout.

208
00:18:01,110 --> 00:18:03,333
Got me all sweat-stinky.

209
00:18:03,413 --> 00:18:06,669
Phew! Definitely could use a shower.

210
00:18:06,749 --> 00:18:08,839
I think better when I don't reek.

211
00:18:08,919 --> 00:18:12,041
Still got to figure out what to do
about Nightwig over there.

212
00:18:12,421 --> 00:18:15,946
Hmm, what to wear, what to wear?

213
00:18:16,026 --> 00:18:19,883
Sucker-punch Harley.
Arctic Harley. Street-luge Harley.

214
00:18:19,963 --> 00:18:24,621
Roller-babe Harley. Steampunk Harley.
Goth-Lolita Harley.

215
00:18:24,901 --> 00:18:27,858
Hey, Nightwig,
is it true you used to be Robin?

216
00:18:28,938 --> 00:18:33,578
Hmph. Ain't that a kick in the pants.
Little boy-wonder all grown up.

217
00:18:37,246 --> 00:18:40,486
Okay, now, don't be getting any funny ideas.

218
00:18:40,566 --> 00:18:42,620
Too late.

219
00:18:42,952 --> 00:18:46,700
It's funny. I always kind of thought
you and Batman didn't like girls.

220
00:18:46,780 --> 00:18:49,846
- Wait, what?
- You know, that book...

221
00:18:49,926 --> 00:18:52,365
...with the headlights
and the eyeball-gouging...

222
00:18:52,445 --> 00:18:54,424
...I had to write a paper
on it back in college.

223
00:18:54,504 --> 00:18:56,786
- Got a B-minus.
- Look, Harley, I...

224
00:18:56,866 --> 00:19:00,083
Pretty lonely these last few months,
if you know what I mean.

225
00:19:00,163 --> 00:19:03,793
You don't meet a lot of likely
prospects at Superbabes.

226
00:19:03,873 --> 00:19:05,529
I'm kind of choosy.

227
00:19:05,609 --> 00:19:09,333
I'm not saying I don't want to,
'cause that could be nice.

228
00:19:09,413 --> 00:19:13,316
All sorts of wrong, but nice. Right now...

229
00:19:13,396 --> 00:19:15,939
...I just really need to find Poison...

230
00:19:16,019 --> 00:19:18,841
Face it, sugar. I got something you want...

231
00:19:18,921 --> 00:19:21,845
...and you sure as shooting
got something I want.

232
00:19:21,925 --> 00:19:25,414
So, be a good boy, and maybe, maybe...

233
00:19:25,494 --> 00:19:27,717
...wama will give you a cookie.

234
00:19:28,297 --> 00:19:30,653
The things I do for Gotham.

235
00:19:30,733 --> 00:19:33,372
I'm taking that as a yes.

236
00:19:35,621 --> 00:19:37,594
It's disgusting.

237
00:19:37,974 --> 00:19:40,044
It's an abomination.

238
00:19:41,528 --> 00:19:45,101
You think I like swapping spit
with this geezer every six hours?

239
00:19:45,181 --> 00:19:48,972
If you've got a better way to keep him
under our control, I am all ears.

240
00:19:49,352 --> 00:19:51,507
There's always torture.

241
00:19:51,587 --> 00:19:53,443
I don't torture.

242
00:19:53,573 --> 00:19:56,046
The seven-billion meat bags
who infest this world...

243
00:19:56,126 --> 00:19:59,234
...would probably consider
our plans for them torture.

244
00:19:59,314 --> 00:20:01,911
Or at least cruel and inhumane.

245
00:20:01,991 --> 00:20:05,989
Our plans are for the improvement
of every organism on Earth.

246
00:20:06,149 --> 00:20:08,492
The very definition of humane.

247
00:20:08,572 --> 00:20:11,364
"Humane." What an ironic word...

248
00:20:11,444 --> 00:20:16,065
...coined by a species completely devoid
of compassion for any other life forms...

249
00:20:16,145 --> 00:20:18,128
...or each other, for that matter.

250
00:20:18,208 --> 00:20:22,738
They all talk about climate change,
but have they actually changed anything?

251
00:20:22,818 --> 00:20:27,910
Indeed, they have. They've doubled
their output of greenhouse gases...

252
00:20:27,990 --> 00:20:30,326
...increased the rate of deforestation...

253
00:20:30,406 --> 00:20:32,549
...ravaged the planet.

254
00:20:32,629 --> 00:20:35,792
You said it yourself, Pamela, and I quote...

255
00:20:35,872 --> 00:20:41,442
"Humans simply will not give a crap
unless we force them to."

256
00:20:41,522 --> 00:20:44,527
Well, once our virus is activated...

257
00:20:44,607 --> 00:20:48,928
...every single person on this planet
will have a vested interest...

258
00:20:49,008 --> 00:20:51,482
...in going green.

259
00:21:12,401 --> 00:21:16,167
- Oh, God, no. Stop, stop!
- You stop it!

260
00:21:16,247 --> 00:21:18,686
You're gonna make me pee!

261
00:21:21,144 --> 00:21:23,373
Hey, hey, hey.

262
00:21:30,921 --> 00:21:33,008
Harley Quinn reporting for duty, sir.

263
00:21:33,088 --> 00:21:36,395
I was... I was just about to call you.

264
00:21:49,472 --> 00:21:51,311
Meet you at the car.

265
00:21:54,511 --> 00:21:56,383
Did you get what you needed?

266
00:21:56,613 --> 00:22:01,905
Well, yeah... Ivy's whereabouts,
of course, that's what you meant.

267
00:22:01,985 --> 00:22:04,256
No, not yet.

268
00:22:07,356 --> 00:22:09,961
Like you never made out with a super-villain.

269
00:22:15,848 --> 00:22:18,287
So, here's how it's gonna work, dynamic duo.

270
00:22:18,367 --> 00:22:22,107
Nobody knows Ivy like I know Ivy.
Now, I can help you find her...

271
00:22:22,187 --> 00:22:25,158
...but you're gonna let me talk some sense
into her before you come in, swinging.

272
00:22:25,238 --> 00:22:26,987
And then, when this whole thing is over...

273
00:22:27,067 --> 00:22:29,433
...you're gonna put in a good word
for me with the parole board.

274
00:22:29,513 --> 00:22:33,374
Tell them what a fine, upstanding
citizen I am, etcetera, etcetera.

275
00:22:34,384 --> 00:22:35,888
Hmm...

276
00:22:36,586 --> 00:22:38,660
- ...no.
- What the what?

277
00:22:38,740 --> 00:22:42,111
But, I mean... aren't you gonna...
don't you need...

278
00:22:42,191 --> 00:22:44,707
I don't make deals with psychopaths.

279
00:22:44,787 --> 00:22:49,354
Sociopath! So-ci-o-path!

280
00:22:49,434 --> 00:22:51,987
Jeez, why does everybody
always get that wrong?

281
00:22:52,067 --> 00:22:54,958
If you aren't willing to agree to my terms,
why should I help you?

282
00:22:55,108 --> 00:22:58,093
You'll help us, or the rest
of the world will cease to exist.

283
00:22:58,173 --> 00:23:00,965
As insane as you are, you enjoy living.

284
00:23:02,085 --> 00:23:05,627
How about just a little something
to sweeten the deal? Spa day?

285
00:23:05,707 --> 00:23:09,386
Autographed picture
for my little cousin? He's real sick.

286
00:23:10,854 --> 00:23:13,069
Okay, fine, whatever, you're the boss.

287
00:23:13,149 --> 00:23:16,915
Wait, she's coming with us?
Is that really a good idea?

288
00:23:16,995 --> 00:23:20,984
It's not my first choice. But we can't
afford to let her out of our sight.

289
00:23:21,064 --> 00:23:23,261
She might tip off Ivy that we're on to her.

290
00:23:23,341 --> 00:23:25,854
Yeah, dangerous loony over here.

291
00:23:25,934 --> 00:23:28,206
Never know what she's gonna do.

292
00:23:32,708 --> 00:23:34,997
Here, there's a little trick to it.

293
00:23:35,077 --> 00:23:39,192
- Hey! Watch the hands, Buster Brown.
- Sorry, I was just...

294
00:23:39,272 --> 00:23:42,306
Jeez, 20 minutes of naughty fun time
and they think they own you.

295
00:23:42,386 --> 00:23:44,239
I wasn't, I was just trying to...

296
00:23:44,319 --> 00:23:46,842
Look, maybe I'll call you sometime, okay?

297
00:23:46,922 --> 00:23:49,360
Like when I'm out of batteries or something.

298
00:23:54,847 --> 00:23:57,554
Based on Goldblum's area of expertise...

299
00:23:57,634 --> 00:24:00,190
...Woodrue and Ivy's ideological profiles

300
00:24:00,270 --> 00:24:04,287
...and the S.T.A.R. Labs break-in,
there's only one conclusion.

301
00:24:04,367 --> 00:24:07,631
They're going to synthesize the formula
that created Swamp Thing...

302
00:24:07,711 --> 00:24:12,002
...convert it into a fast-spreading
virus and "save the world..."

303
00:24:12,082 --> 00:24:14,821
...by turning humanity
into animal-plant hybrids.

304
00:24:14,901 --> 00:24:17,456
What? Ew. Look, don't get me wrong.

305
00:24:17,536 --> 00:24:21,577
I ain't no racist. I mean, some
of my best friends are plant people.

306
00:24:21,657 --> 00:24:24,780
Well, on the bright side, at least
they aren't actually killing anyone.

307
00:24:24,860 --> 00:24:27,623
- Perhaps not intentionally.
- Here we go.

308
00:24:27,703 --> 00:24:31,288
It's bad enough if they succeed
and we all live as plant people.

309
00:24:31,368 --> 00:24:33,709
But that's not even the worst-case scenario.

310
00:24:34,069 --> 00:24:36,058
If any part of their plan is off...

311
00:24:36,138 --> 00:24:39,695
...even a slight bit,
within weeks, days maybe...

312
00:24:39,775 --> 00:24:42,898
We could be looking at the extinction
of all life on the planet.

313
00:24:42,978 --> 00:24:45,701
- Jeebus.
- But wait a minute.

314
00:24:45,781 --> 00:24:49,823
Why do they need the Holland formula?
Why not just make the virus from themselves?

315
00:24:49,903 --> 00:24:53,803
It's a shortcut. Reverse engineering
their own DNA could take years...

316
00:24:53,883 --> 00:24:57,881
...maybe decades. Neither of them
was ever fully human to begin with.

317
00:24:57,961 --> 00:25:01,952
She's a natural mutation. And he's
an exile Dryad from another dimension.

318
00:25:02,032 --> 00:25:06,690
- "Exile Dryad from..." you shitting me!
- We've seen weirder things.

319
00:25:06,770 --> 00:25:11,395
Harley, we just need you to help us find Ivy.
That's all. We'll handle the rest.

320
00:25:11,475 --> 00:25:13,363
No problem. I know this guy.

321
00:25:13,443 --> 00:25:15,899
One of Ivy's top henchmen,
probably still tight with him.

322
00:25:15,979 --> 00:25:18,701
And he is... oh, my God! Stop the car!

323
00:25:18,781 --> 00:25:20,202
- No.
- But it's him!

324
00:25:20,282 --> 00:25:22,152
- Who?
- That guy!

325
00:25:25,588 --> 00:25:28,659
Hey, you! Bobby Leibowitz!

326
00:25:29,376 --> 00:25:31,177
Oh, crap!

327
00:25:31,527 --> 00:25:33,121
Harley. Wait!

328
00:27:26,875 --> 00:27:28,732
Lousy, stinking...

329
00:27:28,812 --> 00:27:32,535
...stand me up for senior prom!

330
00:27:32,615 --> 00:27:36,692
- That's enough.
- Dumps me for that chick with the big...

331
00:27:36,772 --> 00:27:39,951
- Sorry, she's off her meds.
- Won't happen again.

332
00:27:41,241 --> 00:27:44,462
But seriously, dude, sounds like
you kind of had it coming.

333
00:27:45,374 --> 00:27:49,254
...made my mother cry!
Was she worth it, douchebag?

334
00:28:02,344 --> 00:28:04,548
Waited ten years to get that...

335
00:28:05,948 --> 00:28:07,751
I was just...

336
00:28:09,318 --> 00:28:10,821
But...

337
00:28:12,222 --> 00:28:13,809
He...

338
00:28:14,389 --> 00:28:16,768
Pull a stupid stunt like that again,
and I'm dumping you off...

339
00:28:16,848 --> 00:28:19,228
- ...at the nearest police station.
- Oh, big whoop.

340
00:28:19,308 --> 00:28:22,285
"You're living under my roof.
You play by my rules."

341
00:28:22,365 --> 00:28:26,189
Is that it? Newsflash, gruesome.
You ain't my dad!

342
00:28:26,269 --> 00:28:29,993
This isn't a game, Harley. I need you
to stay focused on the job at hand.

343
00:28:30,073 --> 00:28:33,562
Focus-schmocus. You know,
I'm starting to rethink this whole deal.

344
00:28:33,642 --> 00:28:37,300
Here I am, helping you guys out,
pro bono, I might add...

345
00:28:37,380 --> 00:28:40,336
...and you got to go and get all
mega control-freaky on me.

346
00:28:40,416 --> 00:28:44,329
"Do this. Don't do that!
Sit up straight. Brush after every meal.

347
00:28:44,409 --> 00:28:47,644
"Don't bite your toenails. Keep your knees
together when you're wearing a dress."

348
00:28:47,724 --> 00:28:51,681
- Harley! There are lives at stake.
- Oh, my God!

349
00:28:51,761 --> 00:28:55,366
Yeah, yeah, the whole world's
gonna plotz. I get it. I get it.

350
00:28:56,115 --> 00:28:59,688
You think I'm just some dizzy
airhead that don't know nothing.

351
00:28:59,768 --> 00:29:01,491
Do you know what I am?

352
00:29:01,571 --> 00:29:04,027
My punishment for dropping out of med school.

353
00:29:04,607 --> 00:29:08,263
Wrong. I'm the answer
to all your prayers, pally.

354
00:29:08,343 --> 00:29:11,148
Take the Donnenfeld Expressway to Bludhaven.

355
00:29:12,849 --> 00:29:15,654
Come on. Trust me this time.

356
00:29:33,336 --> 00:29:36,759
Okay, you really wanna
stop the car this time.

357
00:29:36,839 --> 00:29:41,445
Those Hawkgirl spicy wings I had at
Superbabes are doing a tango in my tummy.

358
00:29:48,851 --> 00:29:51,656
Seriously. I'm dying back here.

359
00:29:54,490 --> 00:29:55,993
Fine.

360
00:29:58,993 --> 00:30:02,419
- Ugh! Holy...
- It's not so bad.

361
00:30:02,899 --> 00:30:05,704
Smells like discipline.

362
00:30:16,346 --> 00:30:18,166
Oh, man!

363
00:30:18,246 --> 00:30:21,085
Batman, I'm begging you.

364
00:30:30,726 --> 00:30:34,199
I'll give you ten bucks
if you floor it and don't look back.

365
00:30:39,267 --> 00:30:43,827
I know. It looks like a total dump.
But trust me... it is a total dump.

366
00:30:44,307 --> 00:30:48,113
Howsomever, all the cool
hench-people hang out here.

367
00:30:49,779 --> 00:30:52,468
Bet you dollars to donuts, Shrubbie's inside.

368
00:30:52,548 --> 00:30:55,019
Guy just loves to dance.

369
00:31:08,864 --> 00:31:10,888
I have nightmares like this.

370
00:31:14,853 --> 00:31:17,527
Not sure just how welcome we are here.

371
00:31:17,607 --> 00:31:22,681
Oh, relax. You'll fit right in.
Try to look a little less stick-up-your-assy.

372
00:31:23,946 --> 00:31:27,102
# Don't pull your love out on me, baby

373
00:31:27,182 --> 00:31:31,006
# If you do, then I think
that maybe I'll just lay me down

374
00:31:31,086 --> 00:31:33,577
# Cry for a hundred years

375
00:31:33,657 --> 00:31:36,578
# Don't pull your love out on me, honey

376
00:31:36,658 --> 00:31:38,814
# Take my heart, my soul, my money

377
00:31:38,894 --> 00:31:43,268
# But don't leave me here
drowning in my tears

378
00:31:43,348 --> 00:31:45,754
# You say you're gonna leave

379
00:31:45,834 --> 00:31:48,076
# Gonna take that big white bird

380
00:31:48,156 --> 00:31:50,526
# Gonna fly right out of here

381
00:31:50,606 --> 00:31:52,861
# Without a single word

382
00:31:52,941 --> 00:31:55,397
# But you know you'll break my heart

383
00:31:55,477 --> 00:31:58,368
# When I watch you close that door

384
00:31:58,448 --> 00:32:02,459
# 'Cause I know I won't see you anymore

385
00:32:04,853 --> 00:32:07,577
# But don't pull your love
out on me, baby... #

386
00:32:07,657 --> 00:32:11,674
Oh, look! I was right!
There's Shrubbie. Hey, Shrubbie!

387
00:32:12,727 --> 00:32:14,549
Be right back.

388
00:32:14,629 --> 00:32:17,495
# Don't pull your love out on me, honey

389
00:32:17,575 --> 00:32:21,925
# Take my heart, my soul, my money,
but don't leave me here drowning...

390
00:32:22,005 --> 00:32:23,860
Long time, no see, Shrubbie.

391
00:32:23,940 --> 00:32:26,561
# Haven't I been good to you?

392
00:32:26,641 --> 00:32:28,931
# What about that brand new ring?

393
00:32:29,011 --> 00:32:31,316
# Doesn't that mean love to you?

394
00:32:31,396 --> 00:32:33,687
# Doesn't that mean anything?

395
00:32:33,767 --> 00:32:35,972
# If I threw away my pride

396
00:32:36,052 --> 00:32:39,308
# And I got down on my knees

397
00:32:39,388 --> 00:32:43,428
# Would you make me beg you pretty please? #

398
00:32:45,528 --> 00:32:48,474
# Don't pull your love out on me, baby

399
00:32:48,554 --> 00:32:51,521
# If you do, then I think
that maybe I'll just lay me down

400
00:32:51,601 --> 00:32:53,779
Still got the moves, Shrubbie.

401
00:32:53,859 --> 00:32:58,025
- Milk for the gentleman.
- # Don't pull your love out on me, honey

402
00:32:58,105 --> 00:33:00,409
# Take my heart, my soul, my money

403
00:33:00,489 --> 00:33:04,649
# But don't leave me here
drowning in my tears

404
00:33:05,480 --> 00:33:07,869
# There's so much I wanna do

405
00:33:07,949 --> 00:33:10,239
# I've got love enough for two

406
00:33:10,319 --> 00:33:14,159
# But I'll never use it, girl,
if I don't have you

407
00:33:16,646 --> 00:33:19,481
# Don't pull your love out on me, baby

408
00:33:19,561 --> 00:33:23,285
# If you do, then I think
that maybe I'll just lay me down

409
00:33:23,365 --> 00:33:25,954
# Cry for a hundred years

410
00:33:26,034 --> 00:33:28,858
# Don't pull your love out on me, honey

411
00:33:28,938 --> 00:33:32,527
# Take my heart, my soul, my money,
but don't leave me to drowning... #

412
00:33:32,607 --> 00:33:36,080
I got to do something for Shrubbie
or there's no deal.

413
00:33:55,898 --> 00:33:58,854
# I'm in the phone booth,
it's the one across the hall

414
00:33:58,934 --> 00:34:01,923
# If you don't answer,
I'll just ring it off the wall

415
00:34:02,103 --> 00:34:05,627
# I know he's there, but I just had to call

416
00:34:05,707 --> 00:34:10,500
# Don't leave me hanging on the telephone

417
00:34:12,033 --> 00:34:17,061
# Don't leave me hanging on the telephone

418
00:34:19,622 --> 00:34:22,912
# I heard your mother now,
she's going out the door

419
00:34:22,992 --> 00:34:26,115
# Did she go to work or just go to the store

420
00:34:26,195 --> 00:34:28,918
# All those things she said,
I told you to ignore #

421
00:34:28,998 --> 00:34:32,621
- Hey, buddy, watch this.
- # Oh, why can't we talk again #

422
00:34:32,701 --> 00:34:35,990
- Oh, man. Don't do it.
- # Oh, why can't we talk again

423
00:34:36,070 --> 00:34:39,161
# Oh, why can't we talk again

424
00:34:39,241 --> 00:34:44,299
# Don't leave me hanging on the telephone

425
00:34:45,479 --> 00:34:51,286
# Don't leave me hanging on the telephone

426
00:34:51,366 --> 00:34:54,542
# It's good to hear your voice,
you know it's been so long

427
00:34:54,622 --> 00:34:57,763
# If I don't get your calls,
then everything goes wrong

428
00:34:57,843 --> 00:35:01,484
# I want to tell you something
you've known all along

429
00:35:01,564 --> 00:35:06,444
# Don't leave me hanging on the telephone #

430
00:35:19,982 --> 00:35:21,651
Wait.

431
00:35:21,731 --> 00:35:24,940
# I had to interrupt
and stop this conversation

432
00:35:25,020 --> 00:35:27,840
# Your voice across the line
gives me a strange sensation

433
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:31,447
# I'd like to talk
when I can show you my affection

434
00:35:31,527 --> 00:35:34,884
# Oh, I can't control myself

435
00:35:34,964 --> 00:35:37,921
# Oh, I can't control myself

436
00:35:38,001 --> 00:35:41,224
# Oh, I can't control myself

437
00:35:41,304 --> 00:35:46,862
# Don't leave me hanging on the telephone

438
00:35:46,942 --> 00:35:49,967
# Hang up and run to me, whoa!

439
00:35:50,047 --> 00:35:53,270
# Hang up and run to me, whoa!

440
00:35:53,350 --> 00:35:56,416
# Hang up and run to me, whoa!

441
00:35:56,496 --> 00:36:00,175
# Hang up and run to me, whoa!

442
00:36:00,255 --> 00:36:02,326
# Run to me #

443
00:36:19,207 --> 00:36:20,711
Happy?

444
00:36:21,777 --> 00:36:23,615
Thanks a heap, Shrub.

445
00:36:26,249 --> 00:36:28,253
I got it. Let's go.

446
00:36:36,258 --> 00:36:39,382
You put a lot of bodies
in the slammer, Bat fink.

447
00:36:39,462 --> 00:36:42,254
Only way you getting out of here
is in a black plastic bag...

448
00:36:42,334 --> 00:36:43,846
...with a zipper up the front.

449
00:36:43,926 --> 00:36:47,027
- A body bag.
- He knows what it is!

450
00:37:07,189 --> 00:37:10,645
Okay, boys. Let's dance!

451
00:37:23,206 --> 00:37:25,247
See? That was fun, right?

452
00:37:28,411 --> 00:37:31,276
- Go ahead, Watch Tower.
- Hey, Bat, this is Booster.

453
00:37:31,356 --> 00:37:34,600
Got your emergency alert. Hey,
the thing is, most of our heavy hitters...

454
00:37:34,680 --> 00:37:39,141
...are out near Rigel trying to stop a rogue
comet or black hole or something.

455
00:37:39,221 --> 00:37:41,745
And a bunch of them are at that
christening at Aquaman's place...

456
00:37:41,825 --> 00:37:44,112
...and you know the reception
down there kind of sucks.

457
00:37:44,192 --> 00:37:47,582
I only got a handful of guys here
on standby. I could send...

458
00:37:47,662 --> 00:37:51,653
...uh, let's see. Black Condor.

459
00:37:51,733 --> 00:37:53,537
The Elongated Man.

460
00:37:54,402 --> 00:37:55,906
Triumph.

461
00:37:56,839 --> 00:37:58,709
Bloodwind.

462
00:37:59,008 --> 00:38:02,530
Or I could just come down myself,
give you guys a hand.

463
00:38:02,610 --> 00:38:05,334
Not much going on up here
and the foosball table is still busted.

464
00:38:05,654 --> 00:38:08,908
That's all right, Booster.
Thanks anyway. We'll make do.

465
00:38:08,988 --> 00:38:13,207
You sure? 'Cause it's no problem.
One of these can totally cover for me.

466
00:38:13,287 --> 00:38:16,735
Sorry, Booster.
Going under some high-tension wires.

467
00:38:16,815 --> 00:38:19,831
- That sounds like paper.
- Over and out.

468
00:38:21,162 --> 00:38:22,919
That was too close.

469
00:38:23,549 --> 00:38:25,901
We got any of them fries left?

470
00:38:29,438 --> 00:38:33,027
You're just going to feel a bit
of pressure here, little fellow.

471
00:38:33,107 --> 00:38:35,579
Everything's going to be just fine.

472
00:38:42,784 --> 00:38:44,239
It's working.

473
00:38:44,719 --> 00:38:46,542
He's stable!

474
00:38:47,122 --> 00:38:51,679
Look how beautiful you are!
Come to Momma, cutie pie.

475
00:38:51,759 --> 00:38:54,517
It works. It works!

476
00:38:54,597 --> 00:38:56,918
This is no ordinary leafy mouse...

477
00:38:56,998 --> 00:38:59,222
...but a harbinger of the new age.

478
00:38:59,302 --> 00:39:04,526
The dead grinding factories of man will be
replaced by cathedrals of mighty redwoods.

479
00:39:04,606 --> 00:39:08,693
A verdant green life-covered
Earth will burst for...

480
00:39:09,844 --> 00:39:11,167
Eww!

481
00:39:11,447 --> 00:39:14,443
Subject response, negative.

482
00:39:14,523 --> 00:39:16,338
Why isn't it working?

483
00:39:16,418 --> 00:39:19,074
He's faking. He's not even trying!

484
00:39:19,154 --> 00:39:21,210
Your persuasion kiss has worn off!

485
00:39:21,290 --> 00:39:24,813
He's still under my control.
Harold, tell us what went wrong.

486
00:39:24,893 --> 00:39:27,450
This is an incredibly complex azeotrope.

487
00:39:27,530 --> 00:39:31,487
The virus conversion of the formula
works perfectly on paper.

488
00:39:31,567 --> 00:39:36,574
There are literally millions of variables
that could be corrupting the process.

489
00:39:36,654 --> 00:39:39,324
Take a guess, meat bag!

490
00:39:39,404 --> 00:39:41,896
Well, guessing is hardly scientific...

491
00:39:41,976 --> 00:39:45,266
...but I suspect it may have
something to do with the fact...

492
00:39:45,346 --> 00:39:49,670
...that we've been using plain old swamp
water from nearby Slaughter Swamp...

493
00:39:49,750 --> 00:39:51,162
...for our experiments.

494
00:39:51,242 --> 00:39:55,177
No, what we need is the precise
bio-nutrients and chemicals...

495
00:39:55,257 --> 00:39:59,215
...from the water at the exact place
where the Swamp Thing was created.

496
00:39:59,295 --> 00:40:02,100
The Ween Right Swamp in Louisiana.

497
00:40:02,684 --> 00:40:05,154
Oh, for God's sake. What a pain in the ass!

498
00:40:05,234 --> 00:40:08,367
No, Pamela, no. It's perfect! Don't you see?

499
00:40:08,447 --> 00:40:11,783
The lagoon feeds directly
into the Gulf of Mexico.

500
00:40:11,863 --> 00:40:15,497
Where the Gulf's stream currents will carry
the virus into the greater Atlantic.

501
00:40:15,577 --> 00:40:18,324
And then, the world!

502
00:40:18,404 --> 00:40:21,403
Mother Earth's salvation.

503
00:40:21,483 --> 00:40:23,954
Ground zero!

504
00:40:28,757 --> 00:40:32,535
- I said it last time. Your turn.
- It's over, Ivy.

505
00:40:32,615 --> 00:40:35,401
- Harley?
- Hiya, Red.

506
00:40:35,481 --> 00:40:38,736
You're with them? Oh, Harl!

507
00:40:38,816 --> 00:40:42,691
Come on, Pammy, what are you doing?
You're really gonna change us all into plants?

508
00:40:42,771 --> 00:40:44,746
You know I don't look good in green.

509
00:40:44,826 --> 00:40:49,334
I'm sorry, Harley, but there's no other way.
Humankind have had their chance.

510
00:40:49,414 --> 00:40:51,665
And you've had yours!

511
00:41:20,900 --> 00:41:22,383
Oh, gross!

512
00:42:06,788 --> 00:42:08,792
Jason, the work!

513
00:42:13,529 --> 00:42:14,944
Whoa, what's happening?

514
00:42:15,024 --> 00:42:17,819
He's waking up.
I need to keep him hypnotized.

515
00:42:17,899 --> 00:42:20,321
Hmm... no.

516
00:42:22,170 --> 00:42:24,041
Occam's Razor.

517
00:42:25,539 --> 00:42:28,063
Red! You can leave me here, Pammy.

518
00:42:28,143 --> 00:42:31,032
You know my skin. I burn easy.

519
00:42:31,112 --> 00:42:33,601
That idiot meat skate betrayed you, Pamela.

520
00:42:33,681 --> 00:42:36,938
She's your worst enemy.
Leave her to her fate!

521
00:43:09,918 --> 00:43:11,473
Nightwing?

522
00:43:11,953 --> 00:43:13,057
Nightwing?

523
00:43:17,657 --> 00:43:19,529
Over here!

524
00:43:30,168 --> 00:43:31,293
You okay?

525
00:43:31,373 --> 00:43:34,228
My ears are gonna be ringing for a week.

526
00:43:34,308 --> 00:43:36,831
But no broken bones. Ow!

527
00:43:36,911 --> 00:43:40,001
I think. Where's Harley?

528
00:43:42,684 --> 00:43:45,689
It's okay. You're gonna be okay.

529
00:43:46,455 --> 00:43:49,678
Just hang in there, Doc. Look, here's Batman.

530
00:43:49,758 --> 00:43:52,513
He'll fix you right up. Sure he will.

531
00:43:52,593 --> 00:43:54,747
Don't pull it out.

532
00:43:56,664 --> 00:43:58,487
Lift his head up.

533
00:44:00,735 --> 00:44:03,373
Louisiana!

534
00:44:04,206 --> 00:44:07,663
- Don't try to talk. It's okay.
- No.

535
00:44:08,643 --> 00:44:10,148
Must...

536
00:44:10,778 --> 00:44:13,984
...they need swamp water.

537
00:44:14,617 --> 00:44:16,138
Complete...

538
00:44:16,818 --> 00:44:18,507
...process.

539
00:44:18,587 --> 00:44:20,410
We're losing him.

540
00:44:21,090 --> 00:44:25,102
It's okay, Doc. You did good.
You did real good.

541
00:44:25,382 --> 00:44:27,347
We'll take it from here.

542
00:44:29,297 --> 00:44:33,789
Hey, Doc. When you get to heaven,
you should look up my bubbe.

543
00:44:33,869 --> 00:44:36,925
Fran Quinzel. She's super nice.

544
00:44:37,005 --> 00:44:39,877
I think you two would really hit it off.

545
00:45:24,820 --> 00:45:29,116
It was wrong. We shouldn't have left them
there, not in the flames. What if she...

546
00:45:29,196 --> 00:45:31,447
Died? Good.

547
00:45:31,527 --> 00:45:33,949
She's on the wrong side of this, Ivy.

548
00:45:34,529 --> 00:45:36,585
Don't tell me you are getting cold feet.

549
00:45:36,665 --> 00:45:38,669
No, I just...

550
00:45:39,117 --> 00:45:40,970
...never mind.

551
00:45:44,972 --> 00:45:47,409
Safe to say we are thoroughly screwed.

552
00:45:47,609 --> 00:45:50,999
They're bound to have all the airports
and train stations covered by now.

553
00:45:51,079 --> 00:45:54,002
And I can maybe disguise myself
and squeak through the cordon...

554
00:45:54,082 --> 00:45:55,971
...but you?

555
00:45:56,551 --> 00:45:59,574
Well, it was a nice dream while it last...

556
00:45:59,654 --> 00:46:01,073
Is that a yam?

557
00:46:01,153 --> 00:46:03,749
A very special yam, yes.

558
00:46:03,829 --> 00:46:06,497
With certain unique properties.

559
00:46:07,496 --> 00:46:11,386
I removed half a dozen of these tubers from
Swamp Thing's corpse a few years ago...

560
00:46:11,466 --> 00:46:13,804
...while he was temporarily deceased.

561
00:46:13,902 --> 00:46:19,179
This is my last one. I've been
saving it for just such an occasion.

562
00:46:21,376 --> 00:46:24,032
- Not hungry.
- Eat.

563
00:46:24,512 --> 00:46:26,541
It's frozen.

564
00:46:26,621 --> 00:46:27,866
Eat!

565
00:46:35,424 --> 00:46:37,027
More!

566
00:46:40,928 --> 00:46:43,952
Ugh! It tastes awful.

567
00:46:44,032 --> 00:46:45,536
Whoa!

568
00:46:52,907 --> 00:46:55,144
Take my hand.

569
00:47:20,034 --> 00:47:21,780
What the...

570
00:47:21,860 --> 00:47:23,407
Relax.

571
00:47:24,672 --> 00:47:27,496
Concentrate on our destination.

572
00:47:28,076 --> 00:47:31,281
Become one with the green.

573
00:47:32,047 --> 00:47:35,053
With the green!

574
00:47:42,056 --> 00:47:44,461
Silly me, I almost forgot.

575
00:48:00,741 --> 00:48:02,797
Oh, man, I'm beat.

576
00:48:03,377 --> 00:48:05,700
How are you doing, Nightwig?

577
00:48:08,651 --> 00:48:11,539
Oh, right, Nightwing, sorry.

578
00:48:11,619 --> 00:48:14,510
It's like that thing when you can't
remember if it's suppose to be "their..."

579
00:48:14,590 --> 00:48:17,880
...with E-I-R, or "they're"
with Y-apostrophe-R-E?

580
00:48:17,960 --> 00:48:20,215
You know, you got a 50-50 chance
to getting it right...

581
00:48:20,295 --> 00:48:22,297
...but somehow you always pick the wrong...

582
00:48:25,434 --> 00:48:28,639
Anyhow... sorry.

583
00:48:32,173 --> 00:48:33,977
Forget it.

584
00:48:35,510 --> 00:48:37,164
Yeah?

585
00:48:37,244 --> 00:48:39,413
So, we're good?

586
00:48:42,885 --> 00:48:44,238
Sure.

587
00:48:54,796 --> 00:48:56,450
The police are setting up roadblocks.

588
00:48:56,530 --> 00:48:59,150
Covering the airports,
bus terminals, train stations.

589
00:48:59,230 --> 00:49:02,790
Sarge Steel is calling in the FBI
and the National Guard.

590
00:49:02,870 --> 00:49:05,279
- What about us?
- We're headed to Louisiana...

591
00:49:05,359 --> 00:49:07,114
...fast.

592
00:49:21,076 --> 00:49:25,505
The GPS coordinates for the Holland
lab are locked in. Saddle up.

593
00:49:27,930 --> 00:49:29,967
Thanks for your help.

594
00:49:34,936 --> 00:49:38,109
Hey! Now wait just a goddamn minute.

595
00:49:38,189 --> 00:49:41,396
That's it? You got what you wanted
and now you just gonna dump me?

596
00:49:41,476 --> 00:49:44,733
Like Nightwing over here?
Captain Kirk'ing me for info and then...

597
00:49:44,813 --> 00:49:48,003
- "...see you later, toots"?
- Hey, you were the one who...

598
00:49:48,083 --> 00:49:51,005
- ...and I never...
- You need me, Batman!

599
00:49:51,085 --> 00:49:54,075
Uh-huh. That's right. You need me!

600
00:49:54,155 --> 00:49:58,499
You saw how tough Plant Guy is.
Tossing you guys around like raggedy dolls.

601
00:49:58,579 --> 00:50:00,823
If he kicked your butts again, then what?

602
00:50:00,903 --> 00:50:05,286
You think you're gonna be able to sweet-talk
Ivy into giving up her diabolical plan?

603
00:50:05,366 --> 00:50:09,911
Huh, Mr. Smoothie? 'Cause I got to tell you,
your line ain't that great. And beside...

604
00:50:09,991 --> 00:50:14,262
Enough! I can't trust you.

605
00:50:14,342 --> 00:50:17,199
But I thought... I mean, we...

606
00:50:17,279 --> 00:50:20,281
You are the walking definition
of "loose cannon", Harley.

607
00:50:20,361 --> 00:50:23,238
For all I know, you might decide
at the last minute that Ivy's plan...

608
00:50:23,318 --> 00:50:27,581
...doesn't sound so cockeyed after all,
because the wind changed direction.

609
00:50:27,661 --> 00:50:30,103
- Or because it's Thursday.
- But...

610
00:50:30,183 --> 00:50:32,780
I can't risk it. The stakes are way too high.

611
00:50:32,860 --> 00:50:34,489
- But...
- But what?

612
00:50:34,569 --> 00:50:37,985
But I'll never survive the veggie apocalypse!

613
00:50:38,065 --> 00:50:40,489
Once I begged my mom for a cat...

614
00:50:40,569 --> 00:50:43,891
...but I left the back door open
one day and it ran away.

615
00:50:43,971 --> 00:50:48,360
And then I begged her for a hamster
and I forgot to feed it for like a month.

616
00:50:48,440 --> 00:50:51,266
So then, then she said that maybe
I could have a plant...

617
00:50:51,346 --> 00:50:55,470
...so she got me this itty-bitty fern
in this cute little yellow pot...

618
00:50:55,550 --> 00:50:57,991
...and I forgot to...

619
00:50:59,487 --> 00:51:01,042
...water it!

620
00:51:01,122 --> 00:51:05,946
Well, what if I forget to water myself?

621
00:51:09,832 --> 00:51:13,487
Oh, please, Mr. "Kind of scary
but actually really nice" Batman.

622
00:51:13,567 --> 00:51:14,822
Please let me come with you.

623
00:51:14,902 --> 00:51:18,759
I can make Ivy change her mind and give
up her diabolical plan with Tree Guy.

624
00:51:18,839 --> 00:51:21,330
I know I can! We're pals.

625
00:51:21,410 --> 00:51:23,964
Yeah, good pals like Jack and Jill.

626
00:51:24,044 --> 00:51:28,652
Or pork and beans. Oh, please. Please!

627
00:51:34,105 --> 00:51:38,259
You know, you're always saying,
"Have a contingency plan."

628
00:51:39,160 --> 00:51:42,284
So, your plan B...

629
00:51:42,364 --> 00:51:44,882
...is Harley Quinn.

630
00:51:55,677 --> 00:51:57,515
God, help us.

631
00:52:06,387 --> 00:52:10,603
Probably should have mentioned,
I sometimes get a little airsick.

632
00:52:36,683 --> 00:52:38,855
Eating me alive out here.

633
00:52:40,205 --> 00:52:42,154
Oh, thank God. Can I have some of that?

634
00:52:42,234 --> 00:52:46,151
It's concentrated sulfuric acid.
A super dehydrating agent.

635
00:52:46,231 --> 00:52:48,617
All of the crazy crap
you got stuffed into that belt...

636
00:52:48,697 --> 00:52:52,240
...and you didn't think to bring
bug spray? To a freaking swamp?

637
00:52:52,700 --> 00:52:54,109
Um...

638
00:52:54,189 --> 00:52:56,623
What are you good for? Huh?

639
00:52:58,806 --> 00:53:01,429
You're probably just low on Vitamin B.

640
00:53:01,509 --> 00:53:05,311
Never mind! Some Boy Scout
you turned out to be.

641
00:53:05,747 --> 00:53:07,269
Ow!

642
00:53:17,481 --> 00:53:20,115
I can't see how they could have
gotten here ahead of us.

643
00:53:20,195 --> 00:53:22,450
With the airports
and train stations locked down?

644
00:53:22,530 --> 00:53:26,234
Probably not. But super-villains
do tend to be very resourceful.

645
00:53:26,314 --> 00:53:29,615
All I know is, if they are here already
you could bet your tushie...

646
00:53:29,695 --> 00:53:33,488
...Ivy's turned some of these bushes
and trees into monster watchdogs.

647
00:53:33,568 --> 00:53:36,263
Like Little Shop of Horrors on steroids.

648
00:53:36,843 --> 00:53:40,102
No fooling. One time, she turned
my stick and lollipops stick...

649
00:53:40,182 --> 00:53:42,404
...into a three-headed snake twig thingy...

650
00:53:42,484 --> 00:53:44,820
...while it was still in my mouth!

651
00:53:45,820 --> 00:53:48,175
I haven't had a lollipop since.

652
00:53:52,393 --> 00:53:54,108
What?

653
00:53:54,188 --> 00:53:58,719
What you said before. I keep thinking
about Plant Guy riding on the subway...

654
00:53:58,799 --> 00:54:02,756
...in a trench coat and hat.
Like some kind of seven-foot-tall flasher.

655
00:54:02,836 --> 00:54:04,892
All made out of celery.

656
00:54:24,291 --> 00:54:26,447
Guess they're definitely here then.

657
00:54:42,244 --> 00:54:44,047
They're coming.

658
00:54:45,095 --> 00:54:46,498
I can feel it.

659
00:54:46,578 --> 00:54:50,012
Would you please stop fidgeting?
I really need to concentrate.

660
00:54:50,352 --> 00:54:52,189
Just hurry.

661
00:54:53,738 --> 00:54:57,277
Almost done. One last step.

662
00:55:14,141 --> 00:55:16,612
Look out! Ivy trap.

663
00:55:17,811 --> 00:55:19,542
Come on, this way.

664
00:55:30,140 --> 00:55:31,694
Harley!

665
00:55:47,611 --> 00:55:50,598
What are you doing?

666
00:55:50,678 --> 00:55:52,900
Just what you expected me to do.

667
00:55:52,980 --> 00:55:56,458
Sucker. Because it's Thursday.

668
00:55:56,918 --> 00:55:58,576
Harley.

669
00:55:58,656 --> 00:56:01,530
Hiya, sweetie. Look, sorry about before.

670
00:56:01,660 --> 00:56:03,977
I had to make these jerks
think I was on their side...

671
00:56:04,057 --> 00:56:07,334
...so I could bring them here and wrap them up
for you, so you can get on with your plan.

672
00:56:07,414 --> 00:56:08,918
Nice, huh?

673
00:56:09,748 --> 00:56:12,620
Pammy, honey, you gotta give up
this crazy plan. It's really, nutzoid.

674
00:56:12,700 --> 00:56:14,780
Please don't turn us all into veggie-people.
There's got to be another way.

675
00:56:14,860 --> 00:56:16,625
You're tampering with things
man was never meant to know.

676
00:56:16,705 --> 00:56:19,984
I could put in a good word for you, 'cause
after all your heart's in the right place...

677
00:56:20,064 --> 00:56:23,556
...even if you killed all those people, but
give your plan. Pammy, sweetie, honey, baby.

678
00:56:23,636 --> 00:56:27,169
- Please, please, please, give up your plan.
- What? No, Harley...

679
00:56:27,249 --> 00:56:30,671
...the Earth is dying.
I am not destroying the world.

680
00:56:30,751 --> 00:56:35,043
I'm saving it. Saving it
from the takers and the users.

681
00:56:35,123 --> 00:56:38,345
We've been surrounded
by men like that all our lives.

682
00:56:38,425 --> 00:56:43,584
But we can change them, trim them,
shape them like a good gardener.

683
00:56:43,664 --> 00:56:46,546
I don't wanna do it, I have to do it.

684
00:56:47,518 --> 00:56:50,484
Well, you can't blame a girl for trying.

685
00:57:00,714 --> 00:57:02,470
Concentrated weed killer.

686
00:57:02,550 --> 00:57:05,493
I always keep them on hand
since the lollipop incident.

687
00:57:05,573 --> 00:57:07,505
I thought we were friends!

688
00:57:07,585 --> 00:57:11,112
Red, friends don't let friends
kill seven billion people.

689
00:57:12,172 --> 00:57:13,739
Uh-oh!

690
00:57:58,005 --> 00:57:59,993
You really are an idiot, Harley.

691
00:58:00,073 --> 00:58:03,645
We could have changed the world,
but you're too dumb to see that!

692
00:58:06,863 --> 00:58:11,125
Oh, yeah? Smart enough
to take away your spanking stick.

693
00:58:11,753 --> 00:58:13,320
Pretty cool, huh?

694
00:58:17,942 --> 00:58:20,447
No, that is cool.

695
00:58:20,527 --> 00:58:22,332
You suck.

696
00:59:28,929 --> 00:59:32,454
Seriously, Pammy,
your plan is totally bat-shit bonkers.

697
00:59:32,534 --> 00:59:35,829
They're killing our world.
What else can I do?

698
00:59:35,909 --> 00:59:38,913
I don't know! Vote Democrat.
Give money to Greenpeace.

699
00:59:38,993 --> 00:59:41,864
- That's for saving whales, moron.
- Whatever!

700
00:59:41,944 --> 00:59:45,982
Anything is better than turning us
all into walking brussel sprouts.

701
01:00:38,481 --> 01:00:40,861
I can do this all night.

702
01:00:40,941 --> 01:00:42,722
I don't have that kind of time.

703
01:00:46,206 --> 01:00:48,080
No fair!

704
01:00:54,368 --> 01:00:56,803
That's it? The virus?

705
01:00:56,883 --> 01:00:58,625
The solution...

706
01:00:58,705 --> 01:01:01,341
...to all the world's problems.

707
01:01:02,356 --> 01:01:04,112
One way or another.

708
01:01:04,192 --> 01:01:06,663
What's that's supposed to mean?

709
01:01:07,027 --> 01:01:11,452
My God, Pammy. You haven't
even tested it yet, have you?

710
01:01:11,932 --> 01:01:16,123
Have you? Batman said that if you get
just one teensy weensy thing wrong...

711
01:01:16,203 --> 01:01:20,061
...you could wind up killing everything
on the planet. Everything, Pammy.

712
01:01:20,141 --> 01:01:22,330
Plants, people, animals.

713
01:01:22,910 --> 01:01:24,414
Everything.

714
01:01:26,146 --> 01:01:30,824
It doesn't matter.
Earth will die anyway if I don't act.

715
01:01:31,918 --> 01:01:35,691
I'm sorry, Harley,
but I have to roll these dice.

716
01:01:36,891 --> 01:01:39,447
You're gonna make me do it, aren't you?

717
01:01:39,527 --> 01:01:43,184
Well, when this is all over just remember...

718
01:01:43,264 --> 01:01:46,487
- ...I gave you a chance.
- What are you...

719
01:01:46,567 --> 01:01:49,222
- No.
- That's right, sweetie.

720
01:01:49,302 --> 01:01:51,533
The nuclear option.

721
01:01:51,613 --> 01:01:54,301
You promised me, you'd never...

722
01:01:58,580 --> 01:02:00,384
Harley, I'm warning you.

723
01:02:06,720 --> 01:02:08,424
Don't you dare!

724
01:02:19,700 --> 01:02:23,140
I hate you so much.

725
01:02:25,672 --> 01:02:28,581
Works every time. Phew!

726
01:02:32,745 --> 01:02:36,003
- Holy crap!
- Pamela, have you...

727
01:02:39,487 --> 01:02:41,041
So...

728
01:02:41,121 --> 01:02:44,411
...this is where your true allegiance lies...

729
01:02:44,491 --> 01:02:47,280
...with that cancerous meat.

730
01:02:47,360 --> 01:02:49,282
We can't do this, Jason.

731
01:02:49,362 --> 01:02:53,627
If we've made one miscalculation
the whole Earth will die.

732
01:02:53,707 --> 01:02:57,525
A small risk. And one
I'm more than willing to take.

733
01:02:58,005 --> 01:02:59,961
Well, I'm not.

734
01:03:00,041 --> 01:03:01,545
Pity.

735
01:03:18,025 --> 01:03:19,426
Get him, Red!

736
01:04:02,936 --> 01:04:05,203
The plant world...

737
01:04:05,283 --> 01:04:07,336
...belongs to me!

738
01:04:15,349 --> 01:04:16,870
Red!

739
01:04:17,300 --> 01:04:21,088
Okay, fugly! You just bought yourself
a first-class beating.

740
01:04:30,898 --> 01:04:32,735
At last...

741
01:04:33,551 --> 01:04:37,208
...humanity's lunatic reign is over.

742
01:04:37,338 --> 01:04:39,684
No longer will this beautiful Earth...

743
01:04:39,784 --> 01:04:42,294
...be ravaged by poison and ignorance.

744
01:04:43,710 --> 01:04:48,540
No more will this be a world
of screaming meat!

745
01:05:36,566 --> 01:05:39,019
Is... is that...

746
01:05:39,099 --> 01:05:40,668
Yes.

747
01:05:41,168 --> 01:05:43,239
Swamp Thing.

748
01:05:57,518 --> 01:06:00,990
Jason Woodrue...

749
01:06:02,088 --> 01:06:05,646
...the Earth has indeed suffered...

750
01:06:05,726 --> 01:06:09,115
...at the hands of mankind.

751
01:06:09,235 --> 01:06:10,784
However...

752
01:06:11,164 --> 01:06:14,988
...this is not the way to right the wrongs...

753
01:06:15,068 --> 01:06:17,681
...done to Mother Gaia.

754
01:06:18,371 --> 01:06:20,961
Though your cause is just...

755
01:06:21,041 --> 01:06:22,863
...your actions...

756
01:06:22,943 --> 01:06:25,633
...have upset the balance...

757
01:06:25,713 --> 01:06:28,029
...in the green.

758
01:06:28,109 --> 01:06:29,737
I'm sorry.

759
01:06:29,817 --> 01:06:32,670
- I'm so sorry.
- Yes.

760
01:06:32,750 --> 01:06:37,111
Watch. Bet you he's gonna turn
Plant Guy into a stump or something.

761
01:06:37,191 --> 01:06:38,506
But...

762
01:06:38,586 --> 01:06:42,226
...it is not my place to judge.

763
01:06:42,596 --> 01:06:43,651
Wait, what?

764
01:06:43,731 --> 01:06:46,220
All will be...

765
01:06:46,300 --> 01:06:48,722
...as it will be.

766
01:06:49,402 --> 01:06:53,797
I return now to the Parliament of Trees...

767
01:06:54,307 --> 01:06:57,197
...to seek the hidden truths...

768
01:06:57,277 --> 01:06:59,532
...at the center of eternity...

769
01:06:59,612 --> 01:07:01,985
No, no, no. No, don't go!

770
01:07:02,215 --> 01:07:05,606
...to know unknowable nature...

771
01:07:05,686 --> 01:07:10,410
...in all its infinite splendors.

772
01:07:10,490 --> 01:07:13,230
Screw unknowable nature! Kick his butt!

773
01:07:18,599 --> 01:07:22,639
Farewell.

774
01:07:35,232 --> 01:07:37,837
Well, that was a big ass bucket of nothing.

775
01:07:47,799 --> 01:07:50,316
- Now what?
- There must be a way.

776
01:07:50,396 --> 01:07:52,052
- I got...
- We've tried everything.

777
01:07:52,132 --> 01:07:54,365
- The sonic disruptor barely fazed him.
- What about...

778
01:07:54,445 --> 01:07:56,947
And the bio-feedback Batarangs
didn't do squat.

779
01:07:57,027 --> 01:07:58,793
- Guys!
- What?

780
01:07:58,873 --> 01:08:01,762
Look, you are pros here and all, but...

781
01:08:02,242 --> 01:08:05,515
...well, he's all leafy and everything.

782
01:08:08,232 --> 01:08:10,233
Anybody got a match?

783
01:08:15,789 --> 01:08:17,660
Oh, shucks.

784
01:10:53,814 --> 01:10:56,636
After my wife ran off
with the pizza delivery guy...

785
01:10:56,716 --> 01:11:00,132
...my OCD started flaring up
and got really bad.

786
01:11:01,421 --> 01:11:03,843
I've been getting up
six or seven times a night...

787
01:11:03,923 --> 01:11:06,728
...making sure the windows
and doors are locked.

788
01:11:09,397 --> 01:11:12,400
My boss is on my case
all the time about my productivity...

789
01:11:12,480 --> 01:11:16,305
...since I have a hard time peeing
anywhere but my home bathroom.

790
01:11:17,370 --> 01:11:22,029
I lost my wife. Now I may lose
my job, my house, my cats...

791
01:11:22,109 --> 01:11:25,466
...my collection of vintage toasters
and vacuum cleaners.

792
01:11:25,546 --> 01:11:29,822
If I can't get this problem under control,
I don't know what I'm gonna do.

793
01:11:29,902 --> 01:11:33,040
It sounds to me
like you're a little bit blue.

794
01:11:33,120 --> 01:11:34,904
Oh, yeah?

795
01:11:34,984 --> 01:11:37,744
And that part about you being wee-wee shy...

796
01:11:37,824 --> 01:11:41,282
...that's rough. I had this cellmate
at Arkham with the same problem.

797
01:11:41,362 --> 01:11:45,501
I says to her, "Sugar, we got a glass wall
and a toilet in the middle of the floor.

798
01:11:45,581 --> 01:11:47,405
"You're in trouble."

799
01:11:49,036 --> 01:11:51,758
- Can you help me?
- Of course I can, silly.

800
01:11:51,838 --> 01:11:55,127
I'm a regular
Dr. Quinn Medicine Person, ain't I?

801
01:11:57,397 --> 01:12:01,004
I'm legally required to remind you
that my doctorate is purely honorary...

802
01:12:01,084 --> 01:12:04,692
...and I'm not a currently accredited
mental-health professional.

803
01:12:04,772 --> 01:12:07,074
- Okay.
- Well, Wesey.

804
01:12:07,154 --> 01:12:10,047
- Okay if I call you Wesey?
- I don't really like it.

805
01:12:10,127 --> 01:12:13,179
Well, Wesey, you could clearly
benefit from therapy.

806
01:12:13,259 --> 01:12:17,149
I know I did. But one thing I learned is
that you never get the most out of stuff...

807
01:12:17,229 --> 01:12:19,854
...when it's just handed to you.
You gotta earn it.

808
01:12:19,934 --> 01:12:21,788
Right, everybody?

809
01:12:21,868 --> 01:12:24,040
Now, as everybody knows...

810
01:12:24,120 --> 01:12:27,995
...the road to mental wellness
is paved with pit bulls.

811
01:12:28,075 --> 01:12:31,114
But all you got to do is make it
to that finish line way over there...

812
01:12:31,194 --> 01:12:35,205
...to win a full year of therapy from
a real, honest-to-goodness shrink.

813
01:12:36,940 --> 01:12:40,707
Come on, don't be like that.
I've got faith in you, Wesey.

814
01:12:40,787 --> 01:12:45,199
Time to turn your life around and start
feeling good about yourself again!

815
01:12:48,409 --> 01:12:50,918
On your mark, get set...

816
01:12:50,998 --> 01:12:52,368
Get healthy!

817
01:12:58,638 --> 01:13:02,199
You have to look through
the rain to see the rainbow.

818
01:13:11,418 --> 01:13:13,886
You'll find love when you stop looking.

819
01:13:17,724 --> 01:13:19,603
Hang in there, baby.

820
01:13:30,790 --> 01:13:34,142
It takes more muscles to frown
than it does to smile.

821
01:13:48,221 --> 01:13:50,127
Aw! Ain't that a shame?

822
01:13:50,207 --> 01:13:53,113
Wendell is headed back to his
crummy house and all those cats...

823
01:13:53,193 --> 01:13:55,915
...without getting the help
he so desperately needs.

824
01:13:55,995 --> 01:13:57,950
Oh, well, that's it for today's show.

825
01:13:58,030 --> 01:14:00,820
Till next time, folks. Be good to yourself.

826
01:14:00,900 --> 01:14:05,214
Because everyone else in the world
is probably out to get you. Bye-bye.
