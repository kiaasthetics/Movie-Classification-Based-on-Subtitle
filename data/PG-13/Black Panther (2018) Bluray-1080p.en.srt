1
00:00:05,796 --> 00:00:06,889
Baba...

2
00:00:07,049 --> 00:00:08,266
Yes, my son.

3
00:00:08,425 --> 00:00:09,846
Tell me a story.

4
00:00:09,926 --> 00:00:12,099
Which one?

5
00:00:12,429 --> 00:00:14,352
The story of home.

6
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:18,102
Millions of years ago...

7
00:00:18,268 --> 00:00:20,861
a meteorite made of vibranium...

8
00:00:21,021 --> 00:00:23,364
the strongest substance
in the universe...

9
00:00:23,524 --> 00:00:25,446
struck the continent
of Africa. ..

10
00:00:27,611 --> 00:00:30,489
Affecting the plant life
around it.

11
00:00:30,655 --> 00:00:32,658
And when the time of man came...

12
00:00:32,823 --> 00:00:36,670
five tribes settled on it
and called it Wakanda.

13
00:00:39,372 --> 00:00:41,966
The tribes lived in constant
war with each other...

14
00:00:42,125 --> 00:00:44,298
until a warrior shaman...

15
00:00:44,460 --> 00:00:47,430
received a vision from
the Panther Goddess Bast...

16
00:00:47,588 --> 00:00:50,637
who led him
to the Heart-Shaped Herb...

17
00:00:51,301 --> 00:00:53,052
a plant that granted him

18
00:00:53,136 --> 00:00:57,140
superhuman strength,
speed and instincts.

19
00:00:57,307 --> 00:00:58,728
The warrior became king...

20
00:00:58,892 --> 00:01:01,270
and the first Black Panther...

21
00:01:01,435 --> 00:01:04,030
the protector of Wakanda.

22
00:01:04,188 --> 00:01:07,033
Four tribes agreed to live
under the king's rule...

23
00:01:07,192 --> 00:01:11,537
but the Jabari Tribe isolated
themselves in the mountains.

24
00:01:12,322 --> 00:01:15,325
The Wakandans used vibranium
to develop technology...

25
00:01:15,492 --> 00:01:18,745
more advanced
than any other nation.

26
00:01:18,912 --> 00:01:20,585
But as Wakanda thrived...

27
00:01:20,746 --> 00:01:24,171
the world around it descended
further into chaos.

28
00:01:28,087 --> 00:01:29,555
To keep vibranium safe...

29
00:01:29,715 --> 00:01:32,685
the Wakandans vowed
to hide in plain sight...

30
00:01:33,593 --> 00:01:35,516
keeping the truth of their power

31
00:01:35,596 --> 00:01:37,597
from the outside world.

32
00:01:39,098 --> 00:01:40,975
And we still hide, Baba?

33
00:01:41,935 --> 00:01:43,027
Yes.

34
00:01:43,811 --> 00:01:44,903
"BOY". Why?

35
00:01:55,740 --> 00:01:57,117
- Lucky shot!
- That ain't lucky!

36
00:01:57,283 --> 00:01:58,627
Whatever! Get outta here!

37
00:01:58,743 --> 00:01:59,745
Check up.

38
00:01:59,828 --> 00:02:02,001
Pick your man up! He open.

39
00:02:03,165 --> 00:02:04,212
Where you at?

40
00:02:04,373 --> 00:02:06,171
Let's go, let's go, let's go.

41
00:02:06,334 --> 00:02:07,507
Pass! Pass!

42
00:02:07,668 --> 00:02:08,794
- Got you, E.
- E, hurry up!

43
00:02:08,961 --> 00:02:10,463
Watch me get this.

44
00:02:10,963 --> 00:02:13,432
Tim Hardaway style.
That's what I call it, baby.

45
00:02:13,508 --> 00:02:14,509
Come on.

46
00:02:14,592 --> 00:02:15,593
What you got?

47
00:02:15,676 --> 00:02:16,677
You ain't got nothing.

48
00:02:16,802 --> 00:02:18,725
Hey, look,
if we get in and out quick,

49
00:02:18,805 --> 00:02:19,806
won't be no worries.

50
00:02:19,973 --> 00:02:21,941
You in the van,
come in through from the west.

51
00:02:22,099 --> 00:02:23,271
Come around the corner.

52
00:02:23,352 --> 00:02:24,524
Land right here.

53
00:02:24,686 --> 00:02:26,365
Me and the twins
are pulling up right here.

54
00:02:26,479 --> 00:02:28,652
We're leaving this car behind,
okay? We come this...

55
00:02:33,027 --> 00:02:34,028
Hide the straps.

56
00:02:42,371 --> 00:02:44,372
Yo, is it the Feds?

57
00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:48,376
No.

58
00:03:00,305 --> 00:03:03,308
It's these two
Grace Jones-looking chicks.

59
00:03:03,891 --> 00:03:05,018
They're holding spears.

60
00:03:05,602 --> 00:03:06,603
Open it.

61
00:03:07,354 --> 00:03:08,479
You serious?

62
00:03:09,063 --> 00:03:11,192
They won't knock again.

63
00:03:28,667 --> 00:03:30,044
Who are you?

64
00:03:30,210 --> 00:03:32,258
Prince N'Jobu, son of Azzuri.

65
00:03:33,504 --> 00:03:36,474
Prove to me you are one of us.

66
00:03:44,057 --> 00:03:45,274
My King.

67
00:03:47,936 --> 00:03:49,278
Leave us.

68
00:03:49,437 --> 00:03:52,442
This is James. I trust him
with my life. He stays...

69
00:03:52,606 --> 00:03:54,735
with your permission,
King T'Chaka.

70
00:03:56,152 --> 00:03:57,324
As you wish.

71
00:03:57,486 --> 00:03:58,612
At ease.

72
00:04:09,457 --> 00:04:11,175
Come, baby brother.

73
00:04:11,334 --> 00:04:13,051
Let me see
how you are holding up.

74
00:04:22,052 --> 00:04:23,225
You look strong.

75
00:04:23,387 --> 00:04:25,310
Glory to Bast,
I am in good health.

76
00:04:25,389 --> 00:04:26,391
How is home?

77
00:04:29,351 --> 00:04:30,694
Not so good.

78
00:04:31,062 --> 00:04:32,654
Baby brother.

79
00:04:32,814 --> 00:04:34,191
There has been an attack.

80
00:04:34,608 --> 00:04:35,824
This man...

81
00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:38,908
Ulysses Klaue...

82
00:04:40,279 --> 00:04:42,327
stole a quarter ton of
vibranium from us...

83
00:04:42,490 --> 00:04:44,744
and triggered a bomb
at the border to escape.

84
00:04:47,036 --> 00:04:48,538
Many lives were lost.

85
00:04:49,915 --> 00:04:51,917
He knew where we hid
the vibranium...

86
00:04:52,082 --> 00:04:53,629
and how to strike.

87
00:04:54,252 --> 00:04:56,721
He had someone on the inside.

88
00:04:57,588 --> 00:04:58,886
Why are you here?

89
00:04:59,382 --> 00:05:02,351
Because I want you
to look me in the eyes...

90
00:05:02,511 --> 00:05:05,435
and tell me
why you betrayed Wakanda.

91
00:05:05,596 --> 00:05:08,225
I did no such thing.

92
00:05:10,810 --> 00:05:12,187
Tell him who you are.

93
00:05:12,353 --> 00:05:14,697
Zuri, son of Badu...

94
00:05:14,855 --> 00:05:15,856
What?

95
00:05:21,529 --> 00:05:24,079
James. James, you lied to me?

96
00:05:24,156 --> 00:05:25,158
Leave him.

97
00:05:25,242 --> 00:05:26,302
You were Wakandan
this whole time?

98
00:05:26,326 --> 00:05:27,326
You betrayed Wakanda!

99
00:05:27,410 --> 00:05:28,471
How could you lie to me like...

100
00:05:28,495 --> 00:05:30,463
Stand down.

101
00:05:33,457 --> 00:05:37,338
Did you think that you were
the only spy we sent here?

102
00:05:49,348 --> 00:05:51,567
Prince N'Jobu...

103
00:05:51,725 --> 00:05:53,353
you will return home at once...

104
00:05:53,519 --> 00:05:55,396
where you will face
the Council...

105
00:05:55,564 --> 00:05:58,237
and inform them of your crimes.

106
00:06:01,444 --> 00:06:02,696
Check up!

107
00:06:04,447 --> 00:06:06,415
Guard your man, guard your man!

108
00:06:07,701 --> 00:06:08,701
Yo.

109
00:06:58,834 --> 00:07:00,677
The tiny nation of Wakanda

110
00:07:00,754 --> 00:07:03,632
is mourning the death
of its monarch, King T'Chaka.

111
00:07:03,798 --> 00:07:06,300
The beloved ruler was one of
many confirmed dead...

112
00:07:06,468 --> 00:07:07,560
after a terrorist attack

113
00:07:07,636 --> 00:07:09,309
at the United Nations
a week ago.

114
00:07:09,471 --> 00:07:12,644
The suspect
has since been apprehended.

115
00:07:12,723 --> 00:07:13,771
Though it remains one of

116
00:07:13,850 --> 00:07:15,119
the poorest countries
in the world...

117
00:07:15,143 --> 00:07:16,894
fortified by mountain ranges...

118
00:07:17,062 --> 00:07:18,689
and an impenetrable
rainforest...

119
00:07:18,855 --> 00:07:20,949
Wakanda does not engage

120
00:07:21,024 --> 00:07:23,697
in international trade
or accept aid.

121
00:07:23,860 --> 00:07:25,112
The succession of the throne...

122
00:07:25,278 --> 00:07:26,547
is expected to fall
to the oldest

123
00:07:26,571 --> 00:07:27,867
of the king's two children...

124
00:07:28,031 --> 00:07:29,374
Prince T'Challa.

125
00:07:30,992 --> 00:07:32,244
My Prince...

126
00:07:32,409 --> 00:07:34,332
coming up on them now.

127
00:07:56,893 --> 00:07:59,771
No need, Okoye.
I can handle this alone.

128
00:08:06,194 --> 00:08:08,947
I will get Nakia out
as quickly as possible.

129
00:08:12,908 --> 00:08:15,206
Just don't freeze
when you see her.

130
00:08:15,370 --> 00:08:16,917
What are you talking about?

131
00:08:17,956 --> 00:08:19,707
I never freeze.

132
00:08:35,764 --> 00:08:36,765
What's going on?

133
00:08:36,850 --> 00:08:40,399
It's the car.
It lost power. It won't start.

134
00:08:41,062 --> 00:08:42,688
The car no start.

135
00:08:43,105 --> 00:08:44,106
What happened?

136
00:08:44,190 --> 00:08:45,533
The engine failed.

137
00:08:46,942 --> 00:08:48,195
Ours, too.

138
00:08:52,740 --> 00:08:54,493
What is it, Captain?

139
00:09:02,958 --> 00:09:05,427
Defense positions.

140
00:09:05,503 --> 00:09:06,879
Defense positions.

141
00:09:07,047 --> 00:09:08,389
Are we under attack?

142
00:09:08,548 --> 00:09:09,970
Defense positions.

143
00:09:11,801 --> 00:09:13,269
Get around to the side.

144
00:09:13,970 --> 00:09:15,312
Defense positions.

145
00:09:17,890 --> 00:09:19,643
Hey. Defense positions!

146
00:09:22,519 --> 00:09:23,692
No games.

147
00:09:44,793 --> 00:09:46,215
What do you see?

148
00:09:54,677 --> 00:09:56,770
Come in. Come in.

149
00:09:56,846 --> 00:09:58,268
Over there! Look back!

150
00:09:59,099 --> 00:10:00,100
Watch out!

151
00:10:25,958 --> 00:10:27,336
T'Challa, no!

152
00:10:28,128 --> 00:10:29,754
This one's just a boy.

153
00:10:31,673 --> 00:10:33,265
He got kidnapped as well.

154
00:10:33,341 --> 00:10:34,341
Nakia...

155
00:10:38,763 --> 00:10:39,934
.33-

156
00:10:42,307 --> 00:10:43,650
- I wanted...
- Hey!

157
00:10:43,809 --> 00:10:46,484
I have her!
Don't move! I will shoot!

158
00:10:46,855 --> 00:10:48,402
I will shoot her right now.

159
00:10:56,114 --> 00:10:57,161
You froze.

160
00:11:01,827 --> 00:11:05,001
Why are you here?
You've ruined my mission.

161
00:11:05,831 --> 00:11:08,380
My father is dead, Nakia.

162
00:11:09,751 --> 00:11:12,551
I will be crowned king tomorrow.

163
00:11:13,673 --> 00:11:15,596
And I wish for you to be there.

164
00:11:22,639 --> 00:11:24,392
Carry yourselves home now.

165
00:11:24,475 --> 00:11:25,475
Thank you.

166
00:11:25,559 --> 00:11:27,120
And take the boy.
Get him to his people.

167
00:11:27,227 --> 00:11:28,524
Thank you.

168
00:11:36,278 --> 00:11:38,407
You will speak
nothing of this day.

169
00:11:38,907 --> 00:11:39,908
Yes.

170
00:11:40,783 --> 00:11:41,783
Thank you.

171
00:11:42,826 --> 00:11:43,827
Thank you.

172
00:12:19,154 --> 00:12:20,576
Sister Nakia...

173
00:12:20,948 --> 00:12:22,542
My Prince...

174
00:12:23,451 --> 00:12:24,952
we are home.

175
00:13:00,989 --> 00:13:02,865
This never gets old.

176
00:13:58,046 --> 00:13:59,047
Queen Mother...

177
00:13:59,797 --> 00:14:00,969
Princess...

178
00:14:01,341 --> 00:14:03,058
My comfort for your loss.

179
00:14:03,216 --> 00:14:04,264
Thank you, Nakia.

180
00:14:04,427 --> 00:14:07,054
It is so good
to have you back with us.

181
00:14:08,306 --> 00:14:09,365
Take her to the River Province

182
00:14:09,389 --> 00:14:10,669
to prepare her for the ceremony.

183
00:14:10,767 --> 00:14:11,938
Yes, General.

184
00:14:21,110 --> 00:14:22,235
Did he freeze?

185
00:14:22,736 --> 00:14:24,705
Like an antelope in headlights.

186
00:14:25,990 --> 00:14:27,332
Are you finished?

187
00:14:32,038 --> 00:14:34,290
So surprised
my little sister came

188
00:14:34,374 --> 00:14:36,297
to see me off
before our big day.

189
00:14:36,459 --> 00:14:37,460
You wish!

190
00:14:37,543 --> 00:14:40,296
I'm here for the EMP beads.
I've developed an update.

191
00:14:40,462 --> 00:14:42,635
Update? No. It worked perfectly.

192
00:14:42,798 --> 00:14:44,278
How many times
do I have to teach you?

193
00:14:44,424 --> 00:14:45,642
Just because something works

194
00:14:45,717 --> 00:14:47,436
doesn't mean
that it cannot be improved.

195
00:14:47,595 --> 00:14:49,768
You are teaching me?
What do you know?

196
00:14:50,722 --> 00:14:52,066
More than you.

197
00:14:53,058 --> 00:14:55,732
I can't wait to see what kind
of update you make...

198
00:14:55,894 --> 00:14:57,817
to your ceremonial outfit.

199
00:14:59,315 --> 00:15:00,407
Shut“.!

200
00:15:01,067 --> 00:15:02,192
Sorry, Mother!

201
00:15:03,068 --> 00:15:05,037
How are you feeling today, Mama?

202
00:15:05,404 --> 00:15:06,576
Proud.

203
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:11,336
Your father and I would talk
about this day all the time.

204
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:14,873
He is with us...

205
00:15:15,038 --> 00:15:18,087
and it is your time to be king.

206
00:15:36,561 --> 00:15:37,903
Good morning.

207
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:40,572
How can I help you?

208
00:15:40,730 --> 00:15:42,607
I was just checking out
these artifacts.

209
00:15:42,692 --> 00:15:43,918
They tell me you're the expert.

210
00:15:43,942 --> 00:15:46,240
You could say that.

211
00:15:47,779 --> 00:15:49,076
They're beautiful.

212
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:52,701
Where's this one from?

213
00:15:52,869 --> 00:15:54,336
The Bobo Ashanti tribe...

214
00:15:54,495 --> 00:15:55,746
present day Ghana...

215
00:15:55,913 --> 00:15:57,004
19th century.

216
00:15:57,164 --> 00:15:58,165
For real?

217
00:15:59,417 --> 00:16:01,168
What about this one?

218
00:16:03,004 --> 00:16:04,971
That one's from the Edo people
of Benin...

219
00:16:05,130 --> 00:16:07,008
16th century.

220
00:16:10,677 --> 00:16:13,100
Now, tell me about this one.

221
00:16:14,514 --> 00:16:17,063
Also from Benin,
seventh century.

222
00:16:17,143 --> 00:16:19,236
Fula tribe, I believe.

223
00:16:20,437 --> 00:16:21,780
Nah.

224
00:16:22,355 --> 00:16:23,607
I beg your pardon?

225
00:16:23,774 --> 00:16:25,650
It was taken by
British soldiers in Benin

226
00:16:25,735 --> 00:16:26,907
but it's from Wakanda.

227
00:16:27,068 --> 00:16:28,571
And it's made out of vibranium.

228
00:16:30,865 --> 00:16:32,366
Don't trip.

229
00:16:32,450 --> 00:16:33,918
L'mma take it
off your hands for you.

230
00:16:35,327 --> 00:16:37,296
These items aren't for sale.

231
00:16:37,871 --> 00:16:40,044
How do you think
your ancestors got these?

232
00:16:40,207 --> 00:16:41,710
You think they paid
a fair price?

233
00:16:41,875 --> 00:16:44,048
Or did they take it, like they
took everything else?

234
00:16:44,419 --> 00:16:46,138
Sir, I'm going to have to

235
00:16:46,213 --> 00:16:47,682
ask you to leave.

236
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:49,307
You got
all this security in here

237
00:16:49,383 --> 00:16:50,884
watching me
ever since I walked in.

238
00:16:51,052 --> 00:16:52,428
But you ain't checking for

239
00:16:52,511 --> 00:16:54,559
what you put in your body.

240
00:16:54,639 --> 00:16:55,890
All right, mate. Let's have it.

241
00:16:55,972 --> 00:16:57,519
Come on, mate. Time.

242
00:16:57,682 --> 00:16:59,322
I think she might not
be feeling too good.

243
00:17:00,101 --> 00:17:01,695
Somebody get some help!
Come here!

244
00:17:01,854 --> 00:17:04,573
Call a doctor, please!
Please, somebody, come help!

245
00:17:04,731 --> 00:17:05,834
Medical emergency right away

246
00:17:05,857 --> 00:17:07,376
in the West African Exhibit,
please, right away.

247
00:17:07,401 --> 00:17:08,402
Look out.

248
00:17:08,486 --> 00:17:11,114
Step back, please.
Step back. Thank you.

249
00:17:11,279 --> 00:17:13,999
Coming through over there.
Medics coming through.

250
00:17:14,909 --> 00:17:16,501
I'm gonna take a break.

251
00:17:20,205 --> 00:17:21,878
Let's give the lady
some space, please.

252
00:17:22,040 --> 00:17:23,087
Step back, please, gents.

253
00:17:23,166 --> 00:17:24,463
Step back, please.

254
00:17:28,381 --> 00:17:30,223
Hey, come here.

255
00:17:30,383 --> 00:17:33,261
Come here. It's okay.

256
00:17:33,927 --> 00:17:37,147
You can go, but just don't
tell anyone, all right?

257
00:17:43,354 --> 00:17:44,873
Bro, why you ain't just
shoot him right here?

258
00:17:44,896 --> 00:17:45,958
Because it's better to leave

259
00:17:45,981 --> 00:17:47,261
the crime scene more spread out.

260
00:17:48,192 --> 00:17:49,910
Makes us look like amateurs.

261
00:18:05,375 --> 00:18:07,878
Now then, let's see if you know

262
00:18:07,961 --> 00:18:09,555
what you're talking about.

263
00:18:16,596 --> 00:18:18,439
That's just a taste.

264
00:18:34,654 --> 00:18:37,157
- You're gonna be a rich boy.
- You better sell that quick.

265
00:18:37,325 --> 00:18:38,951
It's already sold!

266
00:18:39,743 --> 00:18:40,744
Whatever you try,

267
00:18:40,827 --> 00:18:41,930
the Wakandans'll
probably show up.

268
00:18:41,953 --> 00:18:43,422
That'll make my day.

269
00:18:43,497 --> 00:18:44,896
I can kill two birds
with one stone.

270
00:18:47,292 --> 00:18:49,260
You're not telling me
that's vibranium, too?

271
00:18:49,420 --> 00:18:51,218
Nah, I'm just feeling it.

272
00:19:32,837 --> 00:19:33,884
Onward!

273
00:19:34,214 --> 00:19:35,340
Onward!

274
00:20:53,335 --> 00:20:54,882
L, Zuri...

275
00:20:55,587 --> 00:20:57,181
son of Badu...

276
00:20:57,464 --> 00:20:59,092
give to you...

277
00:20:59,258 --> 00:21:01,431
Prince T'Challa...

278
00:21:01,594 --> 00:21:03,311
the Black Panther!

279
00:21:08,267 --> 00:21:09,814
The prince...

280
00:21:09,977 --> 00:21:14,607
will now have the strength
of the Black Panther...

281
00:21:14,773 --> 00:21:17,027
stripped away.

282
00:21:49,808 --> 00:21:50,855
Praise the ancestors.

283
00:21:50,976 --> 00:21:52,318
Praise the ancestors.

284
00:21:52,519 --> 00:21:56,490
Victory in ritual combat...

285
00:21:56,648 --> 00:22:00,199
comes by yield or death.

286
00:22:00,361 --> 00:22:03,911
If any tribe wishes to
put forth a warrior...

287
00:22:04,073 --> 00:22:05,915
I now offer...

288
00:22:06,575 --> 00:22:09,545
a path to the throne.

289
00:22:13,332 --> 00:22:17,962
The Merchant Tribe
will not challenge today.

290
00:22:19,922 --> 00:22:24,051
The Border Tribe
will not challenge today.

291
00:22:26,761 --> 00:22:29,766
The River Tribe
will not challenge today.

292
00:22:32,017 --> 00:22:34,736
The Mining Tribe
will not challenge today.

293
00:22:34,894 --> 00:22:37,818
Is there any member
of a royal blood...

294
00:22:38,648 --> 00:22:41,903
who wishes to challenge
for the throne?

295
00:22:45,655 --> 00:22:48,500
This corset
is really uncomfortable...

296
00:22:48,659 --> 00:22:51,913
so could we all just
wrap it up and go home?

297
00:22:52,538 --> 00:22:53,585
Mother!

298
00:23:18,439 --> 00:23:20,487
- Are they Jabari?
- Yes.

299
00:23:29,450 --> 00:23:32,202
M'Baku, what are you doing here?

300
00:23:34,078 --> 00:23:36,332
It's challenge day.

301
00:23:41,545 --> 00:23:43,172
We have watched...

302
00:23:44,006 --> 00:23:46,304
and listened from the mountains!

303
00:23:46,467 --> 00:23:48,434
We have watched with disgust...

304
00:23:48,594 --> 00:23:51,393
as your
technological advancements

305
00:23:51,471 --> 00:23:53,566
have been overseen by a child!

306
00:23:57,185 --> 00:23:59,608
Who scoffs at tradition!

307
00:24:00,396 --> 00:24:03,276
And now you want to
hand the nation

308
00:24:03,358 --> 00:24:05,281
over to this prince...

309
00:24:06,069 --> 00:24:11,417
who could not keep
his own father safe.

310
00:24:16,372 --> 00:24:18,089
We will not have it.

311
00:24:18,248 --> 00:24:22,344
I said, we will not have it!

312
00:24:22,502 --> 00:24:25,006
I, M'Baku...

313
00:24:26,464 --> 00:24:28,262
leader of the Jabari...

314
00:24:28,424 --> 00:24:32,726
I accept your challenge, M'Baku.

315
00:24:34,013 --> 00:24:35,936
Glory to Hanuman.

316
00:24:53,992 --> 00:24:56,211
Jabari!

317
00:24:56,912 --> 00:24:57,913
Dora Milaje!

318
00:24:58,413 --> 00:24:59,413
Onward!

319
00:25:06,505 --> 00:25:09,258
Let the challenge begin!

320
00:25:24,647 --> 00:25:25,648
Stand up!

321
00:25:34,907 --> 00:25:36,625
Come!

322
00:25:44,125 --> 00:25:46,220
T'Challa!

323
00:25:51,299 --> 00:25:52,893
Where is your god now?

324
00:26:03,228 --> 00:26:04,820
Yes!

325
00:26:12,653 --> 00:26:14,451
No powers.

326
00:26:14,781 --> 00:26:16,250
No claws.

327
00:26:17,659 --> 00:26:19,205
No special suit!

328
00:26:19,368 --> 00:26:22,417
Just a boy not fit to lead!

329
00:26:22,580 --> 00:26:25,585
Show him who you are!

330
00:26:42,017 --> 00:26:43,859
I am Prince T'Challa...

331
00:26:44,019 --> 00:26:45,612
son of King T'Chaka!

332
00:26:45,770 --> 00:26:47,397
You can do this, T'Challa!

333
00:27:01,202 --> 00:27:02,203
Yes!

334
00:27:02,746 --> 00:27:03,747
Come on!

335
00:27:03,913 --> 00:27:06,086
Yield! Don't make me kill you.

336
00:27:06,250 --> 00:27:07,843
I would rather die!

337
00:27:11,255 --> 00:27:12,256
T'Challa!

338
00:27:13,464 --> 00:27:14,465
T'Challa!

339
00:27:15,217 --> 00:27:16,218
T'Challa!

340
00:27:17,219 --> 00:27:18,220
T'Challa!

341
00:27:19,054 --> 00:27:20,055
T'Challa!

342
00:27:20,138 --> 00:27:21,265
You have fought with honor!

343
00:27:21,431 --> 00:27:24,025
Now yield! Your people need you.

344
00:27:24,183 --> 00:27:25,184
T'Challa!

345
00:27:25,602 --> 00:27:26,603
T'Challa!

346
00:27:26,686 --> 00:27:27,858
Yield, man!

347
00:27:28,020 --> 00:27:29,272
T'Challa!

348
00:27:29,690 --> 00:27:30,691
T'Challa!

349
00:27:32,526 --> 00:27:35,028
Yes! Yes!

350
00:27:56,592 --> 00:27:59,185
I now present to you...

351
00:27:59,344 --> 00:28:01,688
King T'Challa...

352
00:28:03,390 --> 00:28:06,269
the Black Panther.

353
00:28:12,273 --> 00:28:13,400
Zuri.

354
00:28:14,317 --> 00:28:15,535
My King.

355
00:28:26,204 --> 00:28:27,832
Wakanda forever!

356
00:28:27,998 --> 00:28:30,092
Wakanda forever!

357
00:29:02,365 --> 00:29:04,038
Allow the Heart-Shaped Herb...

358
00:29:04,201 --> 00:29:07,375
to restore the powers
of the Black Panther...

359
00:29:08,413 --> 00:29:11,416
and take you
to the Ancestral Plane.

360
00:29:14,961 --> 00:29:16,009
ZURII T'Chaka...

361
00:29:16,171 --> 00:29:19,174
we call on you.

362
00:29:19,340 --> 00:29:22,220
Come here to your son.

363
00:29:35,022 --> 00:29:36,194
Praise the ancestors.

364
00:31:06,198 --> 00:31:07,198
Father.

365
00:31:07,574 --> 00:31:08,746
My son.

366
00:31:18,125 --> 00:31:19,594
I'm sorry.

367
00:31:19,752 --> 00:31:21,550
Stand up.

368
00:31:21,712 --> 00:31:23,932
You are a king.

369
00:31:37,854 --> 00:31:40,857
What is wrong my son?

370
00:31:41,273 --> 00:31:43,617
I am not ready.

371
00:31:44,443 --> 00:31:46,788
Have you not prepared

372
00:31:46,947 --> 00:31:51,167
to be king your whole life?

373
00:31:51,576 --> 00:31:54,875
Have you not trained
and studied,

374
00:31:55,204 --> 00:31:57,878
been by my side?

375
00:32:00,042 --> 00:32:02,296
That is not
what I am talking about.

376
00:32:06,258 --> 00:32:09,432
I am not ready
to be without you.

377
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:13,598
A man who has not prepared
his children

378
00:32:13,682 --> 00:32:15,229
for his own death...

379
00:32:15,392 --> 00:32:17,565
has failed as a father.

380
00:32:17,727 --> 00:32:20,276
Have I ever failed you?

381
00:32:20,980 --> 00:32:22,324
Never.

382
00:32:27,319 --> 00:32:30,574
Tell me how to
best protect Wakanda.

383
00:32:32,867 --> 00:32:35,290
I want to be a great king, Baba.

384
00:32:36,829 --> 00:32:38,251
Just like you.

385
00:32:38,914 --> 00:32:40,837
You're going to struggle.

386
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:42,844
So you'll need to
surround yourself

387
00:32:42,919 --> 00:32:44,636
with people you trust.

388
00:32:44,796 --> 00:32:48,049
You're a good man
with a good heart.

389
00:32:49,134 --> 00:32:51,557
And it's hard
for a good man to be king.

390
00:32:56,057 --> 00:32:57,354
Breathe.

391
00:32:58,643 --> 00:33:00,065
T'Challa, breathe.

392
00:33:01,896 --> 00:33:03,240
Breathe.

393
00:33:04,191 --> 00:33:05,784
He was there.

394
00:33:07,443 --> 00:33:10,538
He was there. My father.

395
00:33:26,378 --> 00:33:27,380
Just one?

396
00:33:34,221 --> 00:33:36,064
Come home, Nana.

397
00:33:36,222 --> 00:33:37,474
I'm right here.

398
00:33:37,641 --> 00:33:39,108
(Sta)'-

399
00:33:39,768 --> 00:33:43,271
I came to support you
and to honor your father...

400
00:33:43,438 --> 00:33:44,815
but I can't stay.

401
00:33:46,691 --> 00:33:48,818
I found my calling out there.

402
00:33:49,568 --> 00:33:52,448
I've seen too many in need
just to turn a blind eye.

403
00:33:53,114 --> 00:33:54,457
I can't be happy here...

404
00:33:54,615 --> 00:33:57,335
knowing that there's people
out there who have nothing.

405
00:33:58,787 --> 00:34:01,381
What would you have
Wakanda do about it?

406
00:34:02,082 --> 00:34:03,674
Share what we have.

407
00:34:03,833 --> 00:34:05,335
We could provide aid...

408
00:34:05,501 --> 00:34:06,502
and access to technology

409
00:34:06,586 --> 00:34:07,865
and refuge to those who need it.

410
00:34:08,170 --> 00:34:10,423
Other countries do it,
we could do it better.

411
00:34:12,092 --> 00:34:15,016
We are not like
these other countries, Nakia.

412
00:34:16,596 --> 00:34:18,240
If the world found out
what we truly are...

413
00:34:18,264 --> 00:34:19,766
what we possess...

414
00:34:19,932 --> 00:34:21,606
we could lose our way of life.

415
00:34:21,768 --> 00:34:24,065
Wakanda is strong enough
to help others

416
00:34:24,144 --> 00:34:25,987
and protect ourselves
at the same time.

417
00:34:27,773 --> 00:34:30,697
If you were not so stubborn,
you would make a great queen.

418
00:34:30,860 --> 00:34:33,329
I would make a great queen
because I am so stubborn.

419
00:34:33,487 --> 00:34:36,992
- See, you admit it!
- If that's what I wanted.

420
00:34:44,206 --> 00:34:45,753
Is that him?

421
00:34:47,960 --> 00:34:51,010
Glory to Bast, man.
Is he still growing?

422
00:34:52,507 --> 00:34:53,507
Of course.

423
00:34:54,342 --> 00:34:56,344
I see Nakia is back.

424
00:34:57,846 --> 00:34:59,045
You guys going to work it out?

425
00:35:05,353 --> 00:35:06,478
T'Challa...

426
00:35:07,188 --> 00:35:08,735
what's wrong?

427
00:35:08,898 --> 00:35:10,490
Nakia thinks
we should be doing more.

428
00:35:10,650 --> 00:35:11,650
More, like what?

429
00:35:11,818 --> 00:35:14,070
Foreign aid, refugee programs.

430
00:35:14,237 --> 00:35:16,079
You let the refugees in...

431
00:35:16,739 --> 00:35:18,708
they bring their problems
with them.

432
00:35:18,867 --> 00:35:21,164
And then Wakanda
is like everywhere else.

433
00:35:23,121 --> 00:35:25,873
Now if you said
you wanted me and my men...

434
00:35:26,833 --> 00:35:28,550
to go out there
and clean up the world,

435
00:35:28,626 --> 00:35:30,253
then I'll be all for it.

436
00:35:30,670 --> 00:35:32,637
But waging war
on other countries

437
00:35:32,713 --> 00:35:34,306
has never been our way.

438
00:35:39,054 --> 00:35:40,054
You, too?

439
00:35:40,221 --> 00:35:41,893
Bast! We're in trouble.

440
00:35:44,893 --> 00:35:46,018
My King.

441
00:35:46,936 --> 00:35:47,936
My love.

442
00:35:48,103 --> 00:35:51,574
You will never guess who just
popped up on our radar.

443
00:35:55,362 --> 00:35:57,159
A misidentified
Wakandan artifact...

444
00:35:57,322 --> 00:35:59,996
was stolen yesterday
from a British museum.

445
00:36:01,284 --> 00:36:04,288
We have learned Ulysses Klaue...

446
00:36:04,454 --> 00:36:07,297
plans to sell the vibranium
to an American buyer...

447
00:36:07,456 --> 00:36:08,800
in South Korea...

448
00:36:08,958 --> 00:36:10,380
tomorrow night.

449
00:36:12,086 --> 00:36:15,967
Klaue has escaped our pursuits
for almost 30 years.

450
00:36:16,925 --> 00:36:20,394
Not capturing him is, perhaps,
my father's greatest regret.

451
00:36:20,552 --> 00:36:23,648
I wish to bring Klaue
back here to stand trial.

452
00:36:23,806 --> 00:36:28,438
Wakanda does not need
a warrior right now.

453
00:36:28,853 --> 00:36:29,853
We need a king.

454
00:36:30,021 --> 00:36:32,695
My parents were killed
when he attacked.

455
00:36:33,733 --> 00:36:35,576
Not a day goes by
when I do not think

456
00:36:35,652 --> 00:36:37,746
about what Klaue took from us.

457
00:36:39,364 --> 00:36:40,364
From me.

458
00:36:40,657 --> 00:36:43,456
It's too great
an opportunity to pass.

459
00:36:43,617 --> 00:36:44,744
Take me with you.

460
00:36:44,827 --> 00:36:46,829
We'll take him down together,
side by side.

461
00:36:46,996 --> 00:36:50,045
I need you here
protecting the border.

462
00:36:50,208 --> 00:36:51,460
Then I ask...

463
00:36:51,626 --> 00:36:53,753
you kill him where he stands...

464
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:56,014
or you bring him back to us.

465
00:36:56,755 --> 00:36:58,302
You have my word.

466
00:37:00,050 --> 00:37:02,179
I will bring him back.

467
00:37:03,637 --> 00:37:05,686
We will proceed
with the mission.

468
00:37:51,728 --> 00:37:52,728
My King!

469
00:37:52,896 --> 00:37:54,648
Stop it. Stop it.

470
00:37:57,400 --> 00:37:59,822
I've already sent a car ahead
to Busan for you.

471
00:38:00,445 --> 00:38:02,322
Who are you taking with you
to Korea?

472
00:38:02,739 --> 00:38:03,831
Okoye.

473
00:38:04,532 --> 00:38:06,409
And Nakia as well.

474
00:38:08,286 --> 00:38:12,041
You sure it's a good idea
to take your ex on a mission?

475
00:38:12,498 --> 00:38:13,590
Yes.

476
00:38:14,751 --> 00:38:15,797
We'll be fine.

477
00:38:15,876 --> 00:38:17,800
Besides, you'll be on call
should we need backup.

478
00:38:17,961 --> 00:38:19,134
Yes!

479
00:38:19,297 --> 00:38:21,675
I have great things
to show you, Brother.

480
00:38:21,840 --> 00:38:24,219
Here are your communication
devices for Korea.

481
00:38:25,052 --> 00:38:26,726
Unlimited range,

482
00:38:26,804 --> 00:38:29,557
also equipped with
audio surveillance system.

483
00:38:29,724 --> 00:38:31,067
Check these out.

484
00:38:32,393 --> 00:38:35,396
Remote access Kimoyo Beads.

485
00:38:35,563 --> 00:38:38,362
Updated to interface directly
with my sand table.

486
00:38:38,817 --> 00:38:40,068
T'CHALLAI.

487
00:38:41,110 --> 00:38:42,202
And what are these?

488
00:38:42,362 --> 00:38:45,286
The real question is
what are those?

489
00:38:46,449 --> 00:38:48,009
Why do you have
your toes out in my lab?

490
00:38:48,076 --> 00:38:50,077
What, you don't like
my royal sandals?

491
00:38:50,244 --> 00:38:53,043
I wanted to go old school
for my first day.

492
00:38:53,206 --> 00:38:55,128
I bet the Elders loved that.

493
00:38:56,376 --> 00:38:57,376
Try them on.

494
00:39:01,463 --> 00:39:02,510
Fully automated.

495
00:39:02,923 --> 00:39:05,177
Like the old American movie
Baba used to watch.

496
00:39:06,344 --> 00:39:08,516
And I made them
completely sound absorbent.

497
00:39:10,681 --> 00:39:11,682
Interesting.

498
00:39:11,849 --> 00:39:13,601
Guess what I call them.

499
00:39:13,768 --> 00:39:15,144
Sneakers.

500
00:39:16,980 --> 00:39:18,106
Because you...

501
00:39:18,273 --> 00:39:19,445
Never mind.

502
00:39:20,983 --> 00:39:22,344
If you're going to take
on Klaue...

503
00:39:22,485 --> 00:39:26,661
you'll need the best
the design group has to offer.

504
00:39:26,822 --> 00:39:27,949
Exhibit A.

505
00:39:28,115 --> 00:39:29,663
- My design.
- Old tech.

506
00:39:29,826 --> 00:39:32,079
- Old?
- Functional, but old.

507
00:39:32,244 --> 00:39:33,918
"Hey, people are shooting at me."

508
00:39:33,996 --> 00:39:35,965
"Wait, let me put on my helmet."

509
00:39:36,123 --> 00:39:37,717
Enough.

510
00:39:38,793 --> 00:39:40,760
Now, look at these.

511
00:39:43,505 --> 00:39:44,722
Do you like that one?

512
00:39:44,882 --> 00:39:46,179
Tempting-

513
00:39:47,050 --> 00:39:49,394
But the idea
is to not be noticed.

514
00:39:51,222 --> 00:39:52,222
This one.

515
00:39:59,271 --> 00:40:00,945
Now tell it to go on.

516
00:40:06,278 --> 00:40:07,496
SHURII Ooh!

517
00:40:08,405 --> 00:40:11,706
The entire suit sits within
the teeth of the necklace.

518
00:40:12,577 --> 00:40:13,998
Strike it.

519
00:40:14,579 --> 00:40:16,172
Anywhere?

520
00:40:19,751 --> 00:40:21,297
Not that hard, genius!

521
00:40:21,460 --> 00:40:23,679
You told me to strike it.
You didn't say how hard.

522
00:40:23,838 --> 00:40:25,135
I invite you to my lab,

523
00:40:25,213 --> 00:40:26,681
and you just kick things around?

524
00:40:26,840 --> 00:40:29,559
Well, maybe you should make it
a little stronger.

525
00:40:29,635 --> 00:40:30,682
Hey.

526
00:40:30,762 --> 00:40:32,309
Wait a minute.

527
00:40:32,472 --> 00:40:35,190
The nanites
absorb the kinetic energy...

528
00:40:35,349 --> 00:40:37,773
and hold it in place
for redistribution.

529
00:40:37,936 --> 00:40:39,278
Very nice.

530
00:40:39,436 --> 00:40:42,110
Strike it again
in the same spot.

531
00:40:44,775 --> 00:40:46,277
You're recording?

532
00:40:46,860 --> 00:40:48,612
For research purposes.

533
00:40:56,036 --> 00:40:57,253
Delete that footage.

534
00:41:17,684 --> 00:41:18,856
This way.

535
00:41:21,853 --> 00:41:23,481
Bast willing,
this will go quickly...

536
00:41:23,648 --> 00:41:26,652
and I can get this ridiculous
thing off my head.

537
00:41:26,818 --> 00:41:30,038
It looks nice.
Just whip it back and forth.

538
00:41:30,195 --> 00:41:32,869
What? It's a disgrace.

539
00:41:34,826 --> 00:41:36,498
Hello Sophia.

540
00:41:36,786 --> 00:41:39,005
Good to see you.

541
00:41:40,289 --> 00:41:41,882
Who are these two?

542
00:41:42,041 --> 00:41:44,088
My friends from Kenya.

543
00:41:44,168 --> 00:41:46,637
Very deep pockets. They're good.

544
00:41:47,045 --> 00:41:49,514
Good for trouble...

545
00:41:49,673 --> 00:41:51,266
like you?

546
00:42:00,101 --> 00:42:01,568
Thank you!

547
00:42:24,375 --> 00:42:25,672
Spread out.

548
00:42:25,835 --> 00:42:28,213
The buyer
is likely already here.

549
00:42:46,063 --> 00:42:47,815
The woman outside.

550
00:42:48,523 --> 00:42:50,947
What trouble
was she referring to?

551
00:42:51,027 --> 00:42:53,826
I got into a disagreement

552
00:42:53,905 --> 00:42:55,748
with some ivory traders.

553
00:42:55,907 --> 00:42:57,954
Made a bit of a mess.

554
00:42:58,034 --> 00:43:00,206
And will there be
any trouble tonight,

555
00:43:00,286 --> 00:43:02,208
Ms. Kenyan Heiress?

556
00:43:02,371 --> 00:43:03,543
Depends...

557
00:43:03,706 --> 00:43:05,925
on how quickly we finish
the mission.

558
00:43:06,083 --> 00:43:07,927
Can we please focus?

559
00:43:09,670 --> 00:43:10,967
Thank you.

560
00:43:12,590 --> 00:43:13,590
Over here.

561
00:43:14,300 --> 00:43:16,143
One whiskey, please.

562
00:43:26,771 --> 00:43:29,570
Eyes up. Americans.

563
00:43:33,193 --> 00:43:34,365
I count three.

564
00:43:36,614 --> 00:43:37,739
Five.

565
00:43:37,907 --> 00:43:39,300
How could you miss
Greased Lightning

566
00:43:39,324 --> 00:43:40,577
there behind you?

567
00:43:40,742 --> 00:43:41,869
Six.

568
00:43:42,036 --> 00:43:45,460
Just spotted an old friend
who works for the CIA.

569
00:43:45,623 --> 00:43:48,217
It just got
a little more complicated.

570
00:43:51,503 --> 00:43:52,630
Agent Ross.

571
00:43:52,797 --> 00:43:53,922
Your Highness.

572
00:43:54,422 --> 00:43:56,016
You are buying from Klaue.

573
00:43:57,969 --> 00:43:59,721
What I'm doing or not doing...

574
00:43:59,887 --> 00:44:01,309
on behalf of the U.S. government

575
00:44:01,389 --> 00:44:02,606
is none of your concern.

576
00:44:02,764 --> 00:44:04,438
Now, whatever the hell
you're up to...

577
00:44:04,599 --> 00:44:06,693
do me a favor,
stay out of my way.

578
00:44:06,853 --> 00:44:08,150
I gave you Zemo.

579
00:44:08,311 --> 00:44:09,688
Didn't I keep it under wraps...

580
00:44:09,856 --> 00:44:11,483
that the king of
a third world country

581
00:44:11,565 --> 00:44:13,534
runs around
in a bulletproof cat suit?

582
00:44:13,693 --> 00:44:15,070
I'd say we were even.

583
00:44:15,235 --> 00:44:16,829
You really need to leave, now.

584
00:44:17,445 --> 00:44:20,791
Klaue is leaving
out that door with me.

585
00:44:21,867 --> 00:44:23,494
You've been warned.

586
00:44:25,413 --> 00:44:26,460
Three, craps.

587
00:44:27,081 --> 00:44:28,333
Hey. You won!

588
00:44:29,876 --> 00:44:31,172
You know what?

589
00:44:31,335 --> 00:44:33,336
I think I'll just take these...

590
00:44:33,503 --> 00:44:35,222
bring them over here

591
00:44:35,297 --> 00:44:37,641
and hold on for safekeeping.

592
00:44:40,260 --> 00:44:43,356
Okay, heads up.
The king of Wakanda is here.

593
00:44:43,514 --> 00:44:45,231
He cannot leave with Klaue.

594
00:44:46,766 --> 00:44:47,768
All right.

595
00:44:47,934 --> 00:44:49,335
Vibranium from the attack
on Sokovia

596
00:44:49,394 --> 00:44:50,396
links back to a person...

597
00:44:50,563 --> 00:44:51,688
that I'm not actually saying

598
00:44:51,771 --> 00:44:52,916
I'm here to make a deal with...

599
00:44:52,940 --> 00:44:55,318
but that deal
will not be called off.

600
00:44:55,483 --> 00:44:56,735
When the dust settles,

601
00:44:56,818 --> 00:44:58,365
you and me can work
something out.

602
00:44:58,528 --> 00:45:00,405
I'm not here to make a deal.

603
00:45:27,266 --> 00:45:29,313
Klaue, plus eight!

604
00:45:29,643 --> 00:45:30,644
General.

605
00:45:30,811 --> 00:45:32,688
In position to secure our exit.

606
00:45:32,855 --> 00:45:33,856
And the vibranium?

607
00:45:33,981 --> 00:45:35,653
I don't see it yet.

608
00:45:35,815 --> 00:45:38,409
I thought there were
no weapons allowed in here.

609
00:45:38,568 --> 00:45:40,320
There's not supposed to be.

610
00:45:40,487 --> 00:45:42,865
Somebody did not get the memo.

611
00:45:43,782 --> 00:45:45,376
Definitely armed.

612
00:45:46,202 --> 00:45:48,079
Well, that is quite
the entourage.

613
00:45:48,246 --> 00:45:49,418
You got a mixtape coming out?

614
00:45:49,579 --> 00:45:52,208
Yeah.
Yeah, actually, there is one.

615
00:45:52,375 --> 00:45:54,251
I'll send you the SoundCloud
link, if you like.

616
00:45:54,418 --> 00:45:55,853
Hey, Dave, can you get
the link to the tape?

617
00:45:55,878 --> 00:45:57,557
Please, don't make me
listen to your music.

618
00:45:57,630 --> 00:45:59,429
I just meant you got a lot of
people with you.

619
00:46:00,215 --> 00:46:01,967
You think they're for you?

620
00:46:03,094 --> 00:46:04,266
Don't worry.

621
00:46:04,427 --> 00:46:06,304
I can do a deal with you
all by myself,

622
00:46:06,389 --> 00:46:07,561
thank you very much.

623
00:46:14,981 --> 00:46:17,483
"OKOYE". Six more. It's a setup.

624
00:46:18,192 --> 00:46:19,739
You got the diamonds?

625
00:46:20,443 --> 00:46:22,195
Okay. That's enough.

626
00:46:24,447 --> 00:46:26,701
- We need to move on Klaue.
- Stand down.

627
00:46:27,117 --> 00:46:28,791
We can't afford a shootout.

628
00:46:28,952 --> 00:46:29,954
Vibranium?

629
00:46:39,255 --> 00:46:41,382
I was going to buy
a fancy suitcase...

630
00:46:41,548 --> 00:46:44,052
but I thought
I'd save myself some money.

631
00:46:44,510 --> 00:46:46,137
It's now or never.

632
00:46:46,304 --> 00:46:47,429
Stand down!

633
00:46:48,014 --> 00:46:49,014
Hey!

634
00:47:02,695 --> 00:47:04,038
Wakandans! They're here!

635
00:47:06,489 --> 00:47:08,083
- Get outta here!
- Kill 'em all!

636
00:47:09,952 --> 00:47:11,329
Diamonds, quick!

637
00:48:08,094 --> 00:48:09,094
Murderer!

638
00:48:15,643 --> 00:48:17,987
You know, you lookjust like
your old man.

639
00:48:27,487 --> 00:48:29,865
I made it rain!

640
00:48:29,949 --> 00:48:31,666
Let's get out of here, boss!

641
00:48:35,496 --> 00:48:38,375
That was awesome!
That was awesome!

642
00:48:38,541 --> 00:48:41,090
Let's go! Go, go, go, come on!

643
00:48:42,961 --> 00:48:45,431
- Do we just leave him?
- He'll catch up.

644
00:48:53,681 --> 00:48:54,806
Shut“.!

645
00:48:58,393 --> 00:48:59,394
Yes!

646
00:48:59,561 --> 00:49:01,985
Remote driving system activated.

647
00:49:02,815 --> 00:49:04,532
Wait! Which side of
the road is it?

648
00:49:04,608 --> 00:49:05,733
For Best's sake!

649
00:49:05,900 --> 00:49:07,244
- Just drive!
- Okay, calm down!

650
00:49:15,494 --> 00:49:17,211
Whoo! Let's go!

651
00:49:17,371 --> 00:49:19,590
Put some music on. What do you
think this is, a funeral?

652
00:49:23,210 --> 00:49:24,677
Which one is he in now?

653
00:49:26,963 --> 00:49:28,306
Hey, split Up!

654
00:49:30,092 --> 00:49:32,092
- They're trying to lose us.
- I'll take the right.

655
00:49:33,971 --> 00:49:36,474
We'll take the other two!
I see a shortcut.

656
00:49:52,655 --> 00:49:53,782
We're not going to make it!

657
00:49:55,451 --> 00:49:56,543
Keep going!

658
00:50:02,750 --> 00:50:04,626
Whoo! Brother!

659
00:50:14,260 --> 00:50:15,603
Hey, what was that?

660
00:50:15,762 --> 00:50:17,764
Don't worry
about it. You're doing great.

661
00:50:29,193 --> 00:50:30,318
Guns.

662
00:50:31,612 --> 00:50:32,864
So primitive!

663
00:50:33,030 --> 00:50:34,873
It's a vibranium car,
you idiots!

664
00:50:34,949 --> 00:50:36,121
The bullets won't penetrate!

665
00:50:38,327 --> 00:50:39,373
What are you doing?

666
00:50:39,536 --> 00:50:40,753
Just drive.

667
00:50:57,387 --> 00:50:58,809
- Whoo!
- Shit!

668
00:51:12,152 --> 00:51:13,824
Hey, look at your suit.

669
00:51:13,987 --> 00:51:15,114
You've been taking bullets,

670
00:51:15,197 --> 00:51:17,074
charging it up
with kinetic energy.

671
00:51:18,951 --> 00:51:20,168
Pull around the truck.

672
00:51:24,998 --> 00:51:26,215
Where'd he go?

673
00:51:35,592 --> 00:51:36,936
You show-off.

674
00:51:38,177 --> 00:51:39,179
There he is!

675
00:51:41,599 --> 00:51:42,599
Hold tight!

676
00:51:46,519 --> 00:51:47,760
All right. Let's have some fun!

677
00:52:15,923 --> 00:52:16,925
Hop in.

678
00:52:17,425 --> 00:52:19,804
Put that spear in the trunk.

679
00:52:25,016 --> 00:52:26,143
Faster, Shuri.

680
00:52:26,309 --> 00:52:27,936
I'm going as fast as I can!

681
00:52:29,605 --> 00:52:30,822
Take a right! Take a right!

682
00:52:35,527 --> 00:52:36,619
No, no, no!

683
00:52:38,280 --> 00:52:40,077
Brother!

684
00:53:03,554 --> 00:53:04,601
Klaue!

685
00:53:06,766 --> 00:53:08,360
Did you think we would forget?

686
00:53:17,527 --> 00:53:19,371
Look at me, murderer!

687
00:53:20,405 --> 00:53:21,782
Where did you get this weapon?

688
00:53:22,157 --> 00:53:24,626
You savages didn't deserve it.

689
00:53:27,286 --> 00:53:30,757
Mercy, King. Mercy.

690
00:53:30,916 --> 00:53:33,043
Every breath you take
is mercy from me.

691
00:53:33,210 --> 00:53:34,461
King!

692
00:53:35,086 --> 00:53:36,963
The world watches.

693
00:53:37,130 --> 00:53:39,054
Come on. Guys. Let's go?

694
00:53:44,804 --> 00:53:45,806
Yeah.

695
00:54:00,528 --> 00:54:01,780
Hello.

696
00:54:04,657 --> 00:54:07,456
I can see you! I can.
I can see you.

697
00:54:15,668 --> 00:54:17,387
So this is a big mess?

698
00:54:17,545 --> 00:54:19,764
I figured we could go
good cop, bad cop.

699
00:54:19,922 --> 00:54:21,643
I'll talk to him first,
then you guys go in.

700
00:54:22,467 --> 00:54:25,186
We can't let him
talk to Klaue alone.

701
00:54:28,222 --> 00:54:31,226
Better to let him talk to
Klaue alone for 5 minutes

702
00:54:31,309 --> 00:54:34,233
than to make a scene here.

703
00:54:35,271 --> 00:54:36,739
After your questioning,

704
00:54:36,815 --> 00:54:38,737
we will take him back
to Wakanda with us.

705
00:54:38,900 --> 00:54:41,449
What? No.
Look, I like you, a lot.

706
00:54:41,612 --> 00:54:44,411
But he's in my custody now.
He's not going anywhere.

707
00:54:44,572 --> 00:54:46,246
Listen, I'm doing you guys
a favor

708
00:54:46,324 --> 00:54:47,918
by letting you even be in here.

709
00:54:51,246 --> 00:54:52,748
If he touches you again,

710
00:54:52,956 --> 00:54:55,675
I'm going to impale him
to this desk.

711
00:54:56,585 --> 00:54:57,927
Does she speak English?

712
00:54:58,295 --> 00:55:00,012
When she wants to.

713
00:55:01,965 --> 00:55:03,012
I'm going in.

714
00:55:03,090 --> 00:55:05,264
When I'm done, you guys are up.

715
00:55:05,427 --> 00:55:07,179
- Agent Ross.
- Yeah?

716
00:55:07,721 --> 00:55:10,644
I do appreciate your help
in Busan.

717
00:55:11,182 --> 00:55:12,400
You see that?

718
00:55:12,976 --> 00:55:14,148
It's called diplomacy.

719
00:55:15,269 --> 00:55:16,271
You're welcome.

720
00:55:18,523 --> 00:55:20,617
Okoye.

721
00:55:20,692 --> 00:55:21,784
Play nice.

722
00:55:21,943 --> 00:55:23,036
Americans.

723
00:55:35,081 --> 00:55:37,081
You know, you really shouldn't
trust the Wakandans.

724
00:55:37,166 --> 00:55:38,463
I'm much more your speed.

725
00:55:38,626 --> 00:55:40,469
I don't trust anybody,
not in this job.

726
00:55:40,628 --> 00:55:43,132
But what I am interested in
is that arm cannon out there.

727
00:55:43,297 --> 00:55:44,469
Where'd you get that?

728
00:55:44,632 --> 00:55:46,485
It's an old mining tool that
I made some adjustments to.

729
00:55:46,510 --> 00:55:48,887
But I can get you one,
if you like.

730
00:55:49,054 --> 00:55:50,934
Why don't you give me the name
of your supplier,

731
00:55:50,972 --> 00:55:52,019
and I'll ask them.

732
00:55:52,181 --> 00:55:53,650
He's right outside.

733
00:55:53,809 --> 00:55:55,402
Why don't you ask him yourself?

734
00:55:55,561 --> 00:55:57,063
What? T'Challa?

735
00:55:57,228 --> 00:56:00,574
You're telling me that weapon
on your arm is from Wakanda?

736
00:56:00,731 --> 00:56:01,733
Bingo.

737
00:56:03,025 --> 00:56:06,074
What do you actually know
about Wakanda?

738
00:56:06,237 --> 00:56:07,489
Um...

739
00:56:08,657 --> 00:56:10,751
Shepherds, textiles,
cool outfits.

740
00:56:10,909 --> 00:56:12,206
It's all a front.

741
00:56:12,827 --> 00:56:15,422
Explorers searched for it
for centuries.

742
00:56:15,581 --> 00:56:18,050
El Dorado, the Golden City.

743
00:56:18,208 --> 00:56:20,552
They thought they could
find it in South America...

744
00:56:20,710 --> 00:56:23,590
but it was in Africa
the whole time.

745
00:56:23,755 --> 00:56:25,552
A technological marvel.

746
00:56:25,715 --> 00:56:28,139
All because it was built
on a mound

747
00:56:28,217 --> 00:56:30,266
of the most valuable metal
known to man.

748
00:56:30,429 --> 00:56:33,523
Isipho, they call it. The gift.

749
00:56:34,099 --> 00:56:35,224
Vibranium.

750
00:56:35,391 --> 00:56:37,565
Vibranium, yeah,
strongest metal on earth.

751
00:56:37,728 --> 00:56:38,945
It's not just a metal.

752
00:56:39,103 --> 00:56:41,652
They sew it into their clothes.

753
00:56:41,815 --> 00:56:44,614
It powers their city,
their tech...

754
00:56:44,775 --> 00:56:46,027
their weapons.

755
00:56:46,695 --> 00:56:47,786
Weapons?

756
00:56:47,945 --> 00:56:48,947
Yeah.

757
00:56:49,030 --> 00:56:51,454
Makes my arm cannon
look like a leaf blower.

758
00:56:51,617 --> 00:56:52,914
That's a nice fairy tale,

759
00:56:52,992 --> 00:56:54,916
but Wakanda is
a third world country...

760
00:56:55,077 --> 00:56:57,547
and you stole
all their vibranium.

761
00:56:57,706 --> 00:56:59,003
I stole...

762
00:57:02,376 --> 00:57:03,628
All Of it?

763
00:57:04,922 --> 00:57:07,516
I took a tiny piece of it.

764
00:57:07,673 --> 00:57:09,391
They have a mountain full of it.

765
00:57:09,550 --> 00:57:11,769
They've been mining it
for thousands of years...

766
00:57:11,929 --> 00:57:14,181
and they still haven't
scratched the surface.

767
00:57:14,347 --> 00:57:16,315
I'm the only outsider
who's seen it

768
00:57:16,391 --> 00:57:17,983
and got out of there alive.

769
00:57:18,518 --> 00:57:19,815
If you don't believe me,

770
00:57:19,894 --> 00:57:23,148
you ask your friend
what his suit is made of.

771
00:57:23,481 --> 00:57:26,076
What his claws are made of.

772
00:57:49,173 --> 00:57:50,766
Your father told the UN...

773
00:57:50,925 --> 00:57:53,849
that Klaue stole
all the vibranium you had.

774
00:57:54,012 --> 00:57:55,559
But now he's telling me
you have more.

775
00:57:55,722 --> 00:57:57,143
And you believe the word

776
00:57:57,224 --> 00:57:59,726
of an arms dealer
strapped to a chair?

777
00:58:17,369 --> 00:58:19,621
Where is that?

778
00:58:20,539 --> 00:58:22,382
Back there.

779
00:58:34,177 --> 00:58:35,519
How much more are you hiding?

780
00:58:37,597 --> 00:58:38,876
Something is happening out back.

781
00:58:45,063 --> 00:58:46,110
Get down!

782
00:58:50,610 --> 00:58:52,032
Stand down!

783
00:58:55,574 --> 00:58:56,574
Cover!

784
00:58:56,699 --> 00:58:57,701
Grenade!

785
00:59:00,954 --> 00:59:03,581
I see you took your time,
didn't you?

786
00:59:23,393 --> 00:59:24,565
My King!

787
00:59:27,856 --> 00:59:29,027
My King.

788
00:59:29,190 --> 00:59:30,317
Nana.

789
00:59:33,070 --> 00:59:34,867
He justjumped in front of me.

790
00:59:37,699 --> 00:59:39,371
I don't think
he'll make it here.

791
00:59:39,451 --> 00:59:40,827
It hit his spine.

792
00:59:43,454 --> 00:59:45,172
Give me a Kimoyo Bead.

793
00:59:49,251 --> 00:59:51,425
This will stabilize him for now.

794
00:59:59,471 --> 01:00:00,972
Give him to us.

795
01:00:01,889 --> 01:00:03,391
We can save him.

796
01:00:12,317 --> 01:00:14,820
Our mission
was to bring back Klaue.

797
01:00:15,945 --> 01:00:17,289
We failed.

798
01:00:17,572 --> 01:00:20,666
This man is a foreign
intelligence operative.

799
01:00:20,826 --> 01:00:23,375
How do we justify
bringing him into our borders?

800
01:00:23,536 --> 01:00:24,789
He took a bullet for me.

801
01:00:24,954 --> 01:00:26,672
That was his choice.

802
01:00:27,373 --> 01:00:29,376
So now we are just supposed to
let him die?

803
01:00:29,543 --> 01:00:31,385
Let us consider
that we heal him.

804
01:00:32,003 --> 01:00:34,802
It is his duty to report back
to his country.

805
01:00:35,632 --> 01:00:37,634
And as king, it is your duty
to protect ours.

806
01:00:37,800 --> 01:00:40,224
I'm well aware of
my duties, General.

807
01:00:40,846 --> 01:00:44,019
I cannotjust let him die...

808
01:00:44,849 --> 01:00:47,228
knowing we can save him.

809
01:00:47,393 --> 01:00:49,817
Where exactly are we taking him?

810
01:00:57,445 --> 01:01:00,244
Great! Another broken
white boy for us to fix.

811
01:01:00,407 --> 01:01:02,375
This is going to be fun.

812
01:01:09,456 --> 01:01:10,708
He will live.

813
01:01:14,920 --> 01:01:16,342
W'Kabi is here.

814
01:01:25,639 --> 01:01:27,983
What's going on, brother?
Where is Klaue?

815
01:01:28,518 --> 01:01:30,019
He's not here.

816
01:01:33,940 --> 01:01:36,112
He slipped through our hands.

817
01:01:37,693 --> 01:01:38,911
"Slipped"?

818
01:01:40,864 --> 01:01:44,664
For 30 years, your father was
in power and did nothing.

819
01:01:44,826 --> 01:01:47,045
With you,
I thought it'd be different.

820
01:01:48,079 --> 01:01:49,922
But it's more of the same.

821
01:02:09,726 --> 01:02:11,443
Let's get going, boss.

822
01:02:12,978 --> 01:02:14,822
You always sell to the CIA?

823
01:02:14,981 --> 01:02:16,903
I sell to the highest bidder.

824
01:02:17,067 --> 01:02:19,195
But don't you worry.
When I get back to Joburg...

825
01:02:19,360 --> 01:02:20,657
and I lay low for a bit,

826
01:02:20,737 --> 01:02:22,217
I'll make sure
both you guys get paid.

827
01:02:22,530 --> 01:02:24,032
I ain't worried
about the money, bro.

828
01:02:24,114 --> 01:02:25,115
I know you good for it.

829
01:02:25,282 --> 01:02:27,876
On our way back,
just drop us off in Wakanda.

830
01:02:27,952 --> 01:02:29,012
You don't want to go there, boy.

831
01:02:29,036 --> 01:02:30,038
Yeah, I do.

832
01:02:32,998 --> 01:02:34,000
Drop it!

833
01:02:34,458 --> 01:02:36,632
Or your little
Bonnie and Clyde routine

834
01:02:36,710 --> 01:02:38,007
ends today.

835
01:02:38,170 --> 01:02:39,547
Put your gun down now!

836
01:02:39,713 --> 01:02:41,306
I'm sorry.

837
01:02:41,465 --> 01:02:43,719
- Sorry, Erik.
- It's gonna be okay.

838
01:03:12,329 --> 01:03:14,628
You really want to go
to Wakanda?

839
01:03:15,666 --> 01:03:17,135
They're savages.

840
01:03:17,918 --> 01:03:21,219
This is what they do
to people like us.

841
01:03:21,380 --> 01:03:22,621
I ain't worried about no brand.

842
01:03:22,715 --> 01:03:24,184
Check these out.

843
01:03:25,510 --> 01:03:26,887
Each one is for a kill.

844
01:03:27,344 --> 01:03:30,063
You can scar yourself as much
as you'd like.

845
01:03:30,222 --> 01:03:33,021
To them,
you'll just be an outsider.

846
01:03:33,184 --> 01:03:35,481
You're crazy to think
that you can walk in there.

847
01:03:41,608 --> 01:03:45,329
To think I saw you
as some crazy American.

848
01:03:59,626 --> 01:04:00,923
Leave us!

849
01:04:11,847 --> 01:04:15,351
So your mission did not go
as planned.

850
01:04:16,436 --> 01:04:20,110
What happened
to my uncle N'Jobu?

851
01:04:20,815 --> 01:04:23,614
My father told me
he disappeared.

852
01:04:24,527 --> 01:04:26,153
There was a man today...

853
01:04:27,072 --> 01:04:31,043
wearing a ring
identical to this one.

854
01:04:32,577 --> 01:04:34,579
That is not possible.

855
01:04:35,079 --> 01:04:38,458
He helped Klaue escape from us
and he was wearing this ring!

856
01:04:38,625 --> 01:04:40,878
My grandfather's ring!

857
01:04:41,043 --> 01:04:42,590
Do not tell me what is possible.

858
01:04:42,670 --> 01:04:43,717
Tell me the truth!

859
01:04:48,510 --> 01:04:50,012
Some truths...

860
01:04:52,972 --> 01:04:56,476
are too much to bear, T'Challa.

861
01:04:57,476 --> 01:04:59,980
That is not your choice to make.

862
01:05:00,855 --> 01:05:01,856
What happened to him?

863
01:05:01,940 --> 01:05:03,487
I promised the king
to say nothing.

864
01:05:03,650 --> 01:05:05,492
I am your king now!

865
01:05:20,875 --> 01:05:23,423
Your uncle took...

866
01:05:24,670 --> 01:05:28,596
a War Dog assignment in America.

867
01:05:31,385 --> 01:05:32,603
Your father...

868
01:05:33,387 --> 01:05:35,106
placed me there...

869
01:05:35,974 --> 01:05:36,974
to observe...

870
01:05:38,559 --> 01:05:40,653
unbeknownst to him.

871
01:05:40,811 --> 01:05:43,735
Your uncle fell in love
with an American woman.

872
01:05:44,315 --> 01:05:45,532
They had a child.

873
01:05:46,943 --> 01:05:49,286
The hardships he saw there...

874
01:05:50,655 --> 01:05:52,748
radicalized your uncle.

875
01:05:52,907 --> 01:05:55,126
I observed
for as long as I could.

876
01:05:56,327 --> 01:05:57,954
Their leaders
have been assassinated.

877
01:05:58,121 --> 01:06:00,543
Communities flooded with drugs
and weapons.

878
01:06:00,706 --> 01:06:03,085
They are overly policed
and incarcerated.

879
01:06:03,543 --> 01:06:05,295
All over the planet...

880
01:06:05,461 --> 01:06:06,759
our people suffer because

881
01:06:06,838 --> 01:06:08,840
they don't have the tools
to fight back.

882
01:06:09,840 --> 01:06:11,137
With vibranium weapons,

883
01:06:11,217 --> 01:06:12,809
they could overthrow
every country...

884
01:06:12,969 --> 01:06:14,766
and Wakanda could rule them all

885
01:06:14,846 --> 01:06:16,143
the right way.

886
01:06:16,306 --> 01:06:19,856
He knew your father
would not support this.

887
01:06:20,726 --> 01:06:23,822
So, your uncle betrayed us.

888
01:06:23,980 --> 01:06:25,197
No!

889
01:06:25,356 --> 01:06:28,610
He helped Klaue
steal the vibranium.

890
01:06:30,152 --> 01:06:31,574
No, no, no.

891
01:06:31,737 --> 01:06:33,331
You will return home at once...

892
01:06:33,489 --> 01:06:35,333
where you will face
the Council...

893
01:06:35,492 --> 01:06:38,461
and inform them of your crimes.

894
01:06:38,619 --> 01:06:40,338
He drew his weapon on me.

895
01:06:40,496 --> 01:06:42,750
No!

896
01:06:57,847 --> 01:07:01,601
Your father
killed his own brother...

897
01:07:01,768 --> 01:07:05,648
to save my life.

898
01:07:09,525 --> 01:07:12,655
Speak nothing of this.

899
01:07:16,949 --> 01:07:18,327
And the child?

900
01:07:22,163 --> 01:07:23,710
We left him.

901
01:07:32,130 --> 01:07:33,302
We had to...

902
01:07:34,425 --> 01:07:35,597
maintain...

903
01:07:37,177 --> 01:07:38,349
the lie.

904
01:08:03,829 --> 01:08:05,251
What is this?

905
01:08:05,789 --> 01:08:07,291
Just a little gift.

906
01:08:31,149 --> 01:08:32,320
Who are you?

907
01:09:21,698 --> 01:09:23,201
All right, where am I?

908
01:09:23,743 --> 01:09:25,996
Don't scare me like that,
colonizer!

909
01:09:26,578 --> 01:09:28,331
What? My name is Everett.

910
01:09:28,747 --> 01:09:31,627
Yes, I know. Everett Ross...

911
01:09:31,792 --> 01:09:34,591
former air force pilot
and now CIA.

912
01:09:35,087 --> 01:09:36,135
Right.

913
01:09:40,842 --> 01:09:42,265
Okay, is this Wakanda?

914
01:09:42,427 --> 01:09:44,055
No, it's Kansas.

915
01:09:47,225 --> 01:09:48,898
How long ago was Korea?

916
01:09:49,060 --> 01:09:50,185
Yesterday.

917
01:09:50,353 --> 01:09:51,354
I don't think so.

918
01:09:51,436 --> 01:09:53,734
Bullet wounds don't just
magically heal overnight.

919
01:09:53,814 --> 01:09:56,033
They do here.

920
01:09:56,192 --> 01:09:59,445
But not by magic, by technology.

921
01:10:03,658 --> 01:10:07,082
Don't touch anything.
My brother will return soon.

922
01:10:30,810 --> 01:10:33,279
These train things...

923
01:10:33,438 --> 01:10:35,690
that's magnetic levitation,
right?

924
01:10:35,856 --> 01:10:36,904
Obviously.

925
01:10:37,065 --> 01:10:41,320
Obviously, but I've never
seen it this efficient.

926
01:10:43,905 --> 01:10:45,185
The light panels, what are they?

927
01:10:45,533 --> 01:10:47,752
- Sonic stabilizers.
- Sonic what?

928
01:10:48,118 --> 01:10:49,416
In its raw form...

929
01:10:49,578 --> 01:10:51,206
vibranium is too dangerous

930
01:10:51,288 --> 01:10:53,041
to be transported
at that speed...

931
01:10:53,207 --> 01:10:56,301
so I developed a way
to temporarily deactivate it.

932
01:10:57,420 --> 01:10:58,921
There's vibranium
on those trains?

933
01:10:59,087 --> 01:11:01,306
There's vibranium all around us.

934
01:11:03,050 --> 01:11:04,643
That's how I healed you.

935
01:11:12,769 --> 01:11:14,190
Where is T'Challa?

936
01:11:14,353 --> 01:11:16,354
His Kimoyo Beads
have been switched off.

937
01:11:16,521 --> 01:11:18,774
Well, we are not
joined at the hip, Okoye.

938
01:11:18,940 --> 01:11:20,238
A man showed up at the border

939
01:11:20,318 --> 01:11:21,614
who claims to have killed Klaue.

940
01:11:21,778 --> 01:11:22,779
What?

941
01:11:22,862 --> 01:11:25,411
W'Kabi is transporting him,
as we speak, to the palace.

942
01:11:25,573 --> 01:11:27,416
We need to find your brother!

943
01:11:27,574 --> 01:11:28,576
An outsider?

944
01:11:28,743 --> 01:11:30,369
No, a Wakandan.

945
01:11:30,536 --> 01:11:31,957
He's not a Wakandan.

946
01:11:34,582 --> 01:11:35,798
He's one of ours.

947
01:11:48,805 --> 01:11:50,853
He killed his own brother...

948
01:11:51,015 --> 01:11:53,188
and left a child behind...

949
01:11:53,350 --> 01:11:54,603
with nothing.

950
01:11:56,561 --> 01:11:58,189
What kind of king...

951
01:12:00,106 --> 01:12:02,279
What kind of man does that?

952
01:12:02,443 --> 01:12:04,662
No man is perfect.

953
01:12:05,529 --> 01:12:06,872
Not even your father.

954
01:12:07,030 --> 01:12:09,750
He didn't even give him
a proper burial.

955
01:12:11,618 --> 01:12:14,713
My uncle N'Jobu betrayed us,
but my father...

956
01:12:16,122 --> 01:12:18,171
he may have created something
even worse.

957
01:12:18,583 --> 01:12:19,585
Hey.

958
01:12:21,420 --> 01:12:22,591
Look at me.

959
01:12:25,716 --> 01:12:29,720
You can't let your father's
mistakes define who you are.

960
01:12:31,346 --> 01:12:35,978
You get to decide what kind of
king you are going to be.

961
01:12:42,065 --> 01:12:44,659
Brother, you need to
get here now!

962
01:12:45,069 --> 01:12:46,365
Erik Stevens.

963
01:12:47,070 --> 01:12:49,038
Graduated Annapolis age 19...

964
01:12:49,198 --> 01:12:51,121
MIT for grad school.

965
01:12:51,283 --> 01:12:53,457
Joined the SEALs and went
straight to Afghanistan...

966
01:12:53,618 --> 01:12:55,041
where he wrapped up
confirmed kills,

967
01:12:55,121 --> 01:12:56,212
like it was a video game.

968
01:12:56,663 --> 01:12:58,416
Started calling him Killmonger.

969
01:12:58,582 --> 01:13:01,256
He joined a JSOC ghost unit.
Now these guys are serious.

970
01:13:01,418 --> 01:13:02,841
They will drop off the grid...

971
01:13:03,003 --> 01:13:04,283
so they can
commit assassinations

972
01:13:04,337 --> 01:13:05,463
and take down governments.

973
01:13:06,298 --> 01:13:09,677
Did he reveal anything
about his identity?

974
01:13:10,011 --> 01:13:11,512
He has a War Dog tattoo...

975
01:13:12,179 --> 01:13:14,773
but we have no record of him.

976
01:13:21,479 --> 01:13:23,323
Is this man Wakandan or not?

977
01:13:24,567 --> 01:13:26,364
Tell us what is going on.

978
01:13:45,796 --> 01:13:46,842
Speak.

979
01:13:47,256 --> 01:13:48,256
Speak.

980
01:13:50,216 --> 01:13:52,470
I'm standing in your house...

981
01:13:52,636 --> 01:13:54,014
serving justice to a man

982
01:13:54,095 --> 01:13:56,394
who stole your vibranium
and murdered your people.

983
01:13:57,224 --> 01:13:58,583
Justice your king
couldn't deliver.

984
01:14:04,023 --> 01:14:06,617
I don't care
that you brought Klaue.

985
01:14:06,775 --> 01:14:09,119
Only reason I don't kill you
where you stand

986
01:14:09,194 --> 01:14:11,243
is because I know who you are.

987
01:14:12,530 --> 01:14:14,203
Now, what do you want?

988
01:14:15,743 --> 01:14:17,461
I want the throne.

989
01:14:18,954 --> 01:14:20,171
My goodness.

990
01:14:22,750 --> 01:14:24,969
Y'all sittin' up here
comfortable.

991
01:14:25,586 --> 01:14:27,087
Must feel good.

992
01:14:27,796 --> 01:14:29,298
It's about two billion people

993
01:14:29,381 --> 01:14:31,009
all over the world
that looks like us.

994
01:14:31,591 --> 01:14:33,560
But their lives
are a lot harder.

995
01:14:33,719 --> 01:14:36,016
Wakanda has the tools
to liberate 'em all.

996
01:14:36,180 --> 01:14:38,399
And what tools are those?

997
01:14:38,975 --> 01:14:41,649
Vibranium. Your weapons.

998
01:14:41,810 --> 01:14:45,440
Our weapons will not be used
to wage war on the world.

999
01:14:45,730 --> 01:14:49,360
It is not our way to be judge,
jury and executioner...

1000
01:14:49,527 --> 01:14:51,369
for people who are not our own.

1001
01:14:51,945 --> 01:14:53,413
Not your own?

1002
01:14:53,572 --> 01:14:56,041
But didn't life start
right here on this continent?

1003
01:14:56,199 --> 01:14:57,622
So ain't all people your people?

1004
01:14:57,784 --> 01:15:01,414
I am not king of all people.
I am king of Wakanda.

1005
01:15:02,288 --> 01:15:04,166
And it is my responsibility

1006
01:15:04,250 --> 01:15:06,127
to make sure
our people are safe...

1007
01:15:06,292 --> 01:15:08,511
and that vibranium does not fall

1008
01:15:08,587 --> 01:15:10,385
into the hands
of a person like you.

1009
01:15:10,547 --> 01:15:11,548
Son.

1010
01:15:12,091 --> 01:15:14,435
We have entertained
this charlatan for too long.

1011
01:15:14,510 --> 01:15:16,353
Reject his request.

1012
01:15:16,511 --> 01:15:19,015
I ain't requesting nothing.

1013
01:15:19,180 --> 01:15:21,854
- Ask who I am.
- You're Erik Stevens.

1014
01:15:23,310 --> 01:15:24,686
An American black operative.

1015
01:15:24,854 --> 01:15:26,572
A mercenary
nicknamed Killmonger.

1016
01:15:26,646 --> 01:15:27,648
That's who you are.

1017
01:15:27,814 --> 01:15:29,362
That's not my name, Princess.

1018
01:15:29,859 --> 01:15:31,110
Ask me, King.

1019
01:15:31,277 --> 01:15:32,448
No.

1020
01:15:33,570 --> 01:15:34,697
Ask me.

1021
01:15:37,033 --> 01:15:38,454
Take him away.

1022
01:15:39,909 --> 01:15:40,911
Who are you?

1023
01:15:41,119 --> 01:15:45,375
I am N'Jadaka,
son of Prince N'Jobu.

1024
01:15:46,500 --> 01:15:47,546
Son of N'Jobu?

1025
01:15:47,710 --> 01:15:48,710
I found my daddy

1026
01:15:48,752 --> 01:15:49,854
with Panther claws in his chest!

1027
01:15:49,878 --> 01:15:51,972
You ain't the son of a king.
You a son of a murderer.

1028
01:15:52,131 --> 01:15:53,256
You're lying!

1029
01:15:53,423 --> 01:15:55,391
- Lies!
- I'm afraid not, Queen Mother.

1030
01:15:57,677 --> 01:15:58,975
What?

1031
01:16:01,431 --> 01:16:02,604
The descendent of N'Jobu.

1032
01:16:02,891 --> 01:16:04,314
Hey, Auntie.

1033
01:16:07,813 --> 01:16:09,735
I'm exercising my blood right

1034
01:16:09,814 --> 01:16:11,488
to challenge
for the mantles of king...

1035
01:16:11,649 --> 01:16:13,243
and Black Panther.

1036
01:16:17,948 --> 01:16:19,324
Do not do this, T'Challa.

1037
01:16:19,492 --> 01:16:21,664
As the son of Prince N'Jobu,

1038
01:16:21,743 --> 01:16:23,371
he is within his rights.

1039
01:16:23,537 --> 01:16:24,833
He has no rights here!

1040
01:16:24,997 --> 01:16:27,091
The challenge will take weeks
to prepare.

1041
01:16:27,248 --> 01:16:30,469
Weeks? I don't need weeks.

1042
01:16:30,627 --> 01:16:32,881
The whole country ain't gotta
be there. I just need him.

1043
01:16:33,046 --> 01:16:35,220
And somebody to get me
outta these chains.

1044
01:16:39,261 --> 01:16:42,140
T'Challa,
what do you know of this?

1045
01:16:43,431 --> 01:16:45,900
I accept your challenge.

1046
01:17:04,036 --> 01:17:05,412
He'll never beat T'Challa.

1047
01:17:05,578 --> 01:17:07,672
He should've just come
to the first challenge

1048
01:17:07,747 --> 01:17:09,500
and gotten it over with.

1049
01:17:15,506 --> 01:17:17,884
The king
will now have the strength

1050
01:17:17,966 --> 01:17:20,720
of the Black Panther
stripped away.

1051
01:17:52,710 --> 01:17:54,006
Where is Agent Ross?

1052
01:17:54,170 --> 01:17:56,922
I locked him in the office.
He's not going anywhere.

1053
01:18:01,385 --> 01:18:03,307
This is your last chance.

1054
01:18:05,305 --> 01:18:07,149
Throw down your weapons,

1055
01:18:07,224 --> 01:18:09,851
and we can handle this
another way.

1056
01:18:17,234 --> 01:18:21,204
I lived my entire life
waitin' for this moment.

1057
01:18:21,363 --> 01:18:25,083
I trained, I lied, I killed...

1058
01:18:25,242 --> 01:18:26,960
just to get here.

1059
01:18:27,744 --> 01:18:31,340
I killed in America,
Afghanistan...

1060
01:18:33,208 --> 01:18:34,256
Iraq.

1061
01:18:35,836 --> 01:18:37,712
I took life from
my own brothers and sisters

1062
01:18:37,796 --> 01:18:38,967
right here on this continent.

1063
01:18:41,675 --> 01:18:43,096
And all this death...

1064
01:18:44,302 --> 01:18:46,680
just so I could kill you.

1065
01:18:54,313 --> 01:18:57,533
Let the challenge begin.

1066
01:19:36,104 --> 01:19:37,105
Yield!

1067
01:19:58,877 --> 01:20:00,220
Snap out of it, T'Challa!

1068
01:20:20,606 --> 01:20:21,608
Come on, get up.

1069
01:20:22,943 --> 01:20:23,944
Come here.

1070
01:20:27,655 --> 01:20:28,953
This is for my father.

1071
01:20:30,408 --> 01:20:31,706
Erik!

1072
01:20:32,411 --> 01:20:34,128
- Zuri, no.
- Stop!

1073
01:20:34,496 --> 01:20:35,712
- Zuri!
- Zuri, don't!

1074
01:20:35,872 --> 01:20:37,875
I am the cause of
your father's death.

1075
01:20:38,042 --> 01:20:39,259
Not him.

1076
01:20:39,792 --> 01:20:40,965
Take me.

1077
01:20:42,296 --> 01:20:43,889
I'll take you both, Uncle James.

1078
01:20:44,797 --> 01:20:46,390
No!

1079
01:20:46,466 --> 01:20:48,935
No! No!

1080
01:20:50,595 --> 01:20:51,643
Zuri, no!

1081
01:20:52,972 --> 01:20:53,974
No!

1082
01:20:54,350 --> 01:20:57,819
No! No! Zuri! Zuri!

1083
01:20:58,311 --> 01:21:00,154
No! No!

1084
01:21:03,359 --> 01:21:05,657
Is this your king?

1085
01:21:07,904 --> 01:21:09,202
Is this your king?

1086
01:21:15,537 --> 01:21:17,038
The Black Panther,

1087
01:21:17,122 --> 01:21:18,920
who's supposed to
lead you into the future?

1088
01:21:19,082 --> 01:21:20,585
Come on, Brother!

1089
01:21:20,751 --> 01:21:22,070
Is there nothing
that can be done?

1090
01:21:23,545 --> 01:21:25,546
Him?

1091
01:21:26,631 --> 01:21:27,792
He's supposed to protect you?

1092
01:21:40,229 --> 01:21:41,697
No.

1093
01:21:49,195 --> 01:21:51,118
No!

1094
01:21:54,283 --> 01:21:56,707
Nah. I'm your king.

1095
01:21:56,869 --> 01:21:58,542
- No! No!
- We have to go now!

1096
01:21:58,704 --> 01:22:00,798
Queen Mother, let's go!

1097
01:22:36,618 --> 01:22:38,336
The Queen Mother and Shuri,
they are safe?

1098
01:22:38,494 --> 01:22:40,167
Yes.

1099
01:22:40,247 --> 01:22:41,623
Thank you.

1100
01:22:41,789 --> 01:22:44,167
We should get
to them immediately.

1101
01:22:44,585 --> 01:22:46,212
I cannot.

1102
01:22:46,377 --> 01:22:46,970
What?

1103
01:22:47,128 --> 01:22:48,551
Though my heart is with you.

1104
01:22:49,965 --> 01:22:52,262
We cannot turn over
our nation to a man

1105
01:22:52,341 --> 01:22:54,060
who showed up here
only hours ago.

1106
01:22:54,136 --> 01:22:55,136
He is of royal blood.

1107
01:22:55,261 --> 01:22:57,560
- He killed T'Challa!
- In ritual combat.

1108
01:22:57,722 --> 01:22:59,565
Does that really matter?

1109
01:23:02,226 --> 01:23:05,150
You are the greatest warrior
Wakanda has.

1110
01:23:05,521 --> 01:23:09,322
Help me overthrow him
before he becomes too strong.

1111
01:23:09,484 --> 01:23:10,610
Overth row?

1112
01:23:11,528 --> 01:23:12,654
Nakia!

1113
01:23:14,113 --> 01:23:16,867
I'm not a spy who can come
and go as they so choose!

1114
01:23:18,618 --> 01:23:23,090
I am loyal to that throne,
no matter who sits upon it.

1115
01:23:23,707 --> 01:23:25,425
What are you loyal to?

1116
01:23:28,878 --> 01:23:30,301
I loved him.

1117
01:23:31,715 --> 01:23:34,012
I loved my country, too.

1118
01:23:34,176 --> 01:23:36,224
Then you serve your country.

1119
01:23:36,386 --> 01:23:39,560
No. I save my country.

1120
01:23:48,606 --> 01:23:49,654
What's wrong?

1121
01:23:49,983 --> 01:23:51,404
The king is dead.

1122
01:23:52,778 --> 01:23:54,701
Come with me,
unless you want to join him.

1123
01:24:14,675 --> 01:24:16,018
First Baba.

1124
01:24:17,511 --> 01:24:19,104
And now my brother.

1125
01:24:21,931 --> 01:24:24,775
Mama, we didn't
even get to bury him.

1126
01:24:32,149 --> 01:24:35,029
- It's me.
- Nakia. Who is this man?

1127
01:24:35,194 --> 01:24:37,037
He's a friend of T'Challa's.
He saved my life.

1128
01:24:38,198 --> 01:24:39,244
Where's Okoye?

1129
01:24:39,323 --> 01:24:40,416
Okoye is not coming.

1130
01:24:40,576 --> 01:24:43,328
She and the Dora Milaje
will serve the new king.

1131
01:24:49,251 --> 01:24:50,594
Wait here.

1132
01:24:54,256 --> 01:24:56,975
What has happened
to our Wakanda?

1133
01:24:59,344 --> 01:25:01,471
Allow the Heart-Shaped Herb...

1134
01:25:01,637 --> 01:25:04,608
to give you the powers
of the Black Panther...

1135
01:25:04,765 --> 01:25:07,564
and take you
to the Ancestral Plane.

1136
01:26:42,738 --> 01:26:45,537
What did I tell you
about going into my things?

1137
01:26:52,832 --> 01:26:55,131
What did you find?

1138
01:26:56,043 --> 01:26:57,466
Your home.

1139
01:26:59,797 --> 01:27:02,801
I gave you a key hoping that
you might see it someday.

1140
01:27:04,720 --> 01:27:06,847
Yes. The sunsets there

1141
01:27:06,930 --> 01:27:08,728
are the most beautiful
in the world.

1142
01:27:11,059 --> 01:27:13,153
But I fear you still may not
be welcome.

1143
01:27:15,896 --> 01:27:16,898
Why?

1144
01:27:19,067 --> 01:27:20,739
They will say you are lost.

1145
01:27:21,319 --> 01:27:22,992
But I'm right here.

1146
01:27:26,908 --> 01:27:29,752
No tears for me?

1147
01:27:33,664 --> 01:27:35,292
Everybody dies.

1148
01:27:37,335 --> 01:27:39,087
It's just life around here.

1149
01:27:43,507 --> 01:27:45,385
Well, look at what I have done.

1150
01:27:46,970 --> 01:27:49,472
I should've taken you back
long ago.

1151
01:27:52,309 --> 01:27:54,731
Instead, we are both
abandoned here.

1152
01:27:59,858 --> 01:28:02,452
Well, maybe your home
is the one that's lost.

1153
01:28:04,445 --> 01:28:06,868
That's why they can't find us.

1154
01:28:13,872 --> 01:28:16,295
Breathe!
Breathe, My King, breathe.

1155
01:28:16,457 --> 01:28:18,836
Breathe. Breathe. Breathe.

1156
01:28:35,644 --> 01:28:37,442
The Heart-Shaped Herb did that?

1157
01:28:40,481 --> 01:28:41,529
This all Of it?

1158
01:28:41,690 --> 01:28:43,568
Yes. So when it comes time
for another king,

1159
01:28:43,652 --> 01:28:44,778
we will be ready.

1160
01:28:45,444 --> 01:28:46,697
Another king?

1161
01:28:48,823 --> 01:28:50,952
Yeah, go ahead
and burn all that.

1162
01:28:51,117 --> 01:28:53,711
My King, we cannot do that.
It is our tradition...

1163
01:28:57,373 --> 01:29:00,344
When I tell you to do
something, I mean that shit.

1164
01:29:04,256 --> 01:29:05,802
Burn it all!

1165
01:29:54,930 --> 01:29:56,432
You know, where I'm from...

1166
01:29:57,391 --> 01:29:59,520
when black folks
started revolutions,

1167
01:29:59,603 --> 01:30:01,354
they never had the firepower...

1168
01:30:01,520 --> 01:30:03,614
or the resources
to fight their oppressors.

1169
01:30:04,231 --> 01:30:05,859
Where was Wakanda?

1170
01:30:11,989 --> 01:30:13,707
Yeah, all that ends today.

1171
01:30:13,867 --> 01:30:16,996
We got spies embedded
in every nation on Earth.

1172
01:30:17,162 --> 01:30:18,880
Already in place.

1173
01:30:19,038 --> 01:30:20,381
I know how colonizers think.

1174
01:30:20,539 --> 01:30:23,088
So we're gonna use their own
strategy against 'em.

1175
01:30:24,085 --> 01:30:26,963
We're gonna send vibranium
weapons out to our War Dogs.

1176
01:30:27,130 --> 01:30:29,849
They'll arm oppressed people
all over the world...

1177
01:30:30,007 --> 01:30:32,430
so they can finally rise up
and kill those in power.

1178
01:30:32,594 --> 01:30:34,266
And their children.

1179
01:30:34,345 --> 01:30:36,097
And anyone else
who takes their side.

1180
01:30:36,264 --> 01:30:38,733
It's time they know
the truth about us!

1181
01:30:38,891 --> 01:30:40,519
We're warriors!

1182
01:30:40,685 --> 01:30:43,859
The world's gonna start over,
and this time, we're on top.

1183
01:30:45,398 --> 01:30:48,777
The sun will never set
on the Wakandan empire.

1184
01:30:49,527 --> 01:30:52,201
Wakanda has survived
for so long...

1185
01:30:52,363 --> 01:30:55,663
by fighting when only
absolutely necessary.

1186
01:30:55,824 --> 01:30:58,453
Wakanda survived
in the past this way, yes.

1187
01:30:59,996 --> 01:31:02,215
But the world is changing,
General.

1188
01:31:02,957 --> 01:31:06,382
Elders, it is getting smaller.

1189
01:31:06,543 --> 01:31:08,421
The outside world
is catching up...

1190
01:31:08,587 --> 01:31:10,590
and soon it will be
the conquerors

1191
01:31:10,673 --> 01:31:12,768
or the conquered.

1192
01:31:14,719 --> 01:31:16,391
I'd rather be the former.

1193
01:31:18,555 --> 01:31:21,184
You heard your orders.
Let's get to it.

1194
01:31:22,935 --> 01:31:24,153
So where are we going again?

1195
01:31:24,311 --> 01:31:25,939
We're taking
the Heart-Shaped Herb

1196
01:31:26,021 --> 01:31:27,023
to Jabariland.

1197
01:31:27,189 --> 01:31:28,817
Heart-Shaped Herb? What is that?

1198
01:31:28,984 --> 01:31:31,407
It gives whoever takes it
heightened abilities.

1199
01:31:31,569 --> 01:31:34,162
It's what made T'Challa
so strong.

1200
01:31:34,698 --> 01:31:35,744
Nana.

1201
01:31:40,119 --> 01:31:41,997
I don't like this.

1202
01:31:42,162 --> 01:31:43,914
The Herb belongs to us.

1203
01:31:44,082 --> 01:31:47,301
We may be creating
a bigger monster with M'Baku.

1204
01:31:53,382 --> 01:31:57,137
Nakia, you should
take it yourself.

1205
01:31:57,720 --> 01:32:01,100
I am a spy with no army.

1206
01:32:02,475 --> 01:32:04,226
I wouldn't stand a chance.

1207
01:32:06,020 --> 01:32:07,523
We'll go.

1208
01:32:14,154 --> 01:32:15,451
Boy.

1209
01:32:20,743 --> 01:32:22,087
Shit.

1210
01:32:23,203 --> 01:32:25,081
Look down. Stay calm.

1211
01:32:25,247 --> 01:32:26,248
Shuri.

1212
01:32:27,542 --> 01:32:28,963
Look down.

1213
01:33:04,287 --> 01:33:05,583
My son...

1214
01:33:07,582 --> 01:33:10,256
was murdered in ritual combat.

1215
01:33:10,710 --> 01:33:12,882
- Were the odds fair?
- Yes, but...

1216
01:33:13,046 --> 01:33:14,639
So it was less a murder
than a defeat.

1217
01:33:14,797 --> 01:33:16,675
- Do not rub our noses in it!
- Silence!

1218
01:33:17,841 --> 01:33:20,435
I make
the pronouncements here, girl.

1219
01:33:20,595 --> 01:33:23,269
Look, Your Highness,
the new king is a U.S...

1220
01:33:25,265 --> 01:33:27,234
The new king...

1221
01:33:35,068 --> 01:33:37,287
You cannot talk!

1222
01:33:37,444 --> 01:33:38,822
One more word,

1223
01:33:38,904 --> 01:33:41,158
and I will feed you
to my children.

1224
01:33:45,328 --> 01:33:47,546
I'm kidding. We are vegetarians.

1225
01:33:54,837 --> 01:33:58,057
Great Gorilla M'Baku...

1226
01:34:00,551 --> 01:34:03,851
this is why we are here.

1227
01:34:04,639 --> 01:34:06,811
To offer this to you.

1228
01:34:07,559 --> 01:34:09,936
An outsider sits on our throne.

1229
01:34:10,103 --> 01:34:11,945
Only you can help us stop him.

1230
01:34:29,538 --> 01:34:30,836
Come with me.

1231
01:34:47,181 --> 01:34:49,229
Impossible!

1232
01:34:55,105 --> 01:34:56,153
Is he breathing?

1233
01:34:56,315 --> 01:34:59,069
He's in a coma.
Barely clinging to life.

1234
01:34:59,444 --> 01:35:01,117
One of our fishermen found him

1235
01:35:01,195 --> 01:35:02,823
at the edge of the river border.

1236
01:35:02,988 --> 01:35:04,286
He brought him to me.

1237
01:35:04,448 --> 01:35:06,201
Why do you have him in the snow?

1238
01:35:06,367 --> 01:35:07,595
It is the only thing keeping him

1239
01:35:07,618 --> 01:35:08,698
from joining the ancestors.

1240
01:35:08,828 --> 01:35:11,377
We need to get him to my lab.
I can heal him there.

1241
01:35:11,538 --> 01:35:13,086
Take him.
He'll be dead in seconds.

1242
01:35:14,792 --> 01:35:16,418
Nana, the Herb.

1243
01:35:33,310 --> 01:35:35,279
I call upon the ancestors.

1244
01:35:35,729 --> 01:35:37,698
I call upon Bast.

1245
01:35:38,190 --> 01:35:41,161
I am here with my son, T'Challa.

1246
01:35:42,194 --> 01:35:43,662
Heal him.

1247
01:35:55,582 --> 01:35:58,552
We must bury him.
Cover him. Cover him!

1248
01:35:58,711 --> 01:35:59,962
Okay.

1249
01:36:12,057 --> 01:36:13,400
Praise the ancestors.

1250
01:36:13,559 --> 01:36:14,560
Praise the ancestors.

1251
01:36:15,686 --> 01:36:17,154
Praise the ancestors.

1252
01:36:18,189 --> 01:36:19,610
Praise the ancestors.

1253
01:36:20,399 --> 01:36:22,118
Wake up, T'Challa.

1254
01:36:23,360 --> 01:36:24,703
Wake up.

1255
01:36:27,198 --> 01:36:28,541
My son.

1256
01:36:34,956 --> 01:36:37,835
The time has come
for you to come home...

1257
01:36:38,001 --> 01:36:40,423
and be reunited with me.

1258
01:36:51,389 --> 01:36:52,810
Why?

1259
01:36:54,934 --> 01:36:58,029
Why didn't you
bring the boy home?

1260
01:36:59,771 --> 01:37:01,274
Why, Baba?

1261
01:37:03,109 --> 01:37:04,326
He...

1262
01:37:05,278 --> 01:37:08,578
He was the truth
I chose to omit.

1263
01:37:09,698 --> 01:37:12,327
You were wrong to abandon him.

1264
01:37:12,493 --> 01:37:14,369
I chose my people.

1265
01:37:15,203 --> 01:37:17,752
I chose Wakanda.

1266
01:37:17,914 --> 01:37:19,792
Our future depended...

1267
01:37:19,958 --> 01:37:21,506
You were wrong!

1268
01:37:21,668 --> 01:37:23,921
All of you were wrong!

1269
01:37:24,963 --> 01:37:27,887
To turn your backs
on the rest of the world!

1270
01:37:30,219 --> 01:37:32,141
We let the fear of our discovery

1271
01:37:32,220 --> 01:37:34,814
stop us from doing
what is right!

1272
01:37:35,891 --> 01:37:37,234
No more!

1273
01:37:41,021 --> 01:37:44,777
I cannot stay here with you.

1274
01:37:46,569 --> 01:37:50,823
I cannot rest
while he sits on the throne.

1275
01:37:51,323 --> 01:37:54,372
He is a monster
of our own making.

1276
01:37:56,037 --> 01:37:59,381
I must take the mantle back.
I must!

1277
01:38:01,417 --> 01:38:04,091
I must right these wrongs.

1278
01:38:14,930 --> 01:38:16,604
Do you have a blanket?

1279
01:38:19,394 --> 01:38:21,237
Killmonger has the full support

1280
01:38:21,311 --> 01:38:22,484
of our military.

1281
01:38:24,606 --> 01:38:26,779
And he burned the garden
of the Heart-Shaped Herb.

1282
01:38:27,859 --> 01:38:28,985
Of course he did.

1283
01:38:29,069 --> 01:38:30,868
That's what he was
trained to do.

1284
01:38:31,029 --> 01:38:32,657
His unit used to work
with the CIA

1285
01:38:32,739 --> 01:38:34,582
to destabilize
foreign countries.

1286
01:38:34,742 --> 01:38:36,836
They would always strike
at transitions of power...

1287
01:38:36,993 --> 01:38:39,167
like an election year,
or the death of a monarch.

1288
01:38:39,329 --> 01:38:41,707
You get control of government,
the military...

1289
01:38:41,873 --> 01:38:43,967
- Our resources.
- Right.

1290
01:38:45,086 --> 01:38:46,087
The Great Mound.

1291
01:38:46,253 --> 01:38:47,926
Our vibranium,
all of my designs.

1292
01:38:48,088 --> 01:38:50,762
He will send our weapons
all over the world.

1293
01:38:54,095 --> 01:38:56,393
You must get them
out of Wakanda safely.

1294
01:38:56,555 --> 01:38:57,556
- What?
- What about you?

1295
01:38:58,474 --> 01:39:00,442
The challenge
will have to continue.

1296
01:39:00,600 --> 01:39:03,900
T'Challa, we will not
leave Wakanda.

1297
01:39:04,063 --> 01:39:06,064
It is my duty to keep you safe.

1298
01:39:06,231 --> 01:39:08,734
If he gets control
of our technology,

1299
01:39:08,818 --> 01:39:10,161
nowhere will be safe.

1300
01:39:30,797 --> 01:39:32,720
The Black Panther lives.

1301
01:39:33,676 --> 01:39:35,770
And when he fights
for the fate of Wakanda...

1302
01:39:35,927 --> 01:39:38,476
I will be right there
beside him.

1303
01:39:39,599 --> 01:39:40,815
As will I.

1304
01:39:41,266 --> 01:39:42,519
I'm in, too.

1305
01:39:44,270 --> 01:39:46,363
What? You're gonna need
all the help you can get.

1306
01:39:49,649 --> 01:39:51,072
Are you done?

1307
01:39:52,235 --> 01:39:54,283
Are you done?

1308
01:39:55,823 --> 01:39:58,997
Could you give me
and Lord M'Baku a moment?

1309
01:40:07,502 --> 01:40:08,627
Thank you.

1310
01:40:09,295 --> 01:40:11,547
I owed you a great debt.

1311
01:40:12,340 --> 01:40:13,932
A life for a life.

1312
01:40:14,091 --> 01:40:15,637
Consider it paid.

1313
01:40:16,301 --> 01:40:18,520
Please allow my mother
to stay here.

1314
01:40:19,305 --> 01:40:22,229
No harm will come to her.
I give you my word.

1315
01:40:23,391 --> 01:40:26,065
You know, I could use
an army as well.

1316
01:40:26,229 --> 01:40:28,856
I bet you could.

1317
01:40:28,939 --> 01:40:30,192
But no.

1318
01:40:31,859 --> 01:40:34,487
I will give no Jabari lives
towards your cause.

1319
01:40:34,654 --> 01:40:36,327
It is our cause.

1320
01:40:36,780 --> 01:40:39,250
- It is for all of us.
- Us'?

1321
01:40:39,408 --> 01:40:41,661
Us? You are the first king
to come here in centuries...

1322
01:40:41,827 --> 01:40:45,797
and now you speak of "us"?

1323
01:40:47,082 --> 01:40:49,756
I cannot speak for past kings.

1324
01:40:50,377 --> 01:40:53,256
But an enemy sits
on the throne right now.

1325
01:40:53,421 --> 01:40:56,301
We both know the power
of vibranium.

1326
01:40:56,967 --> 01:40:59,061
If Killmonger
gains control of it,

1327
01:40:59,136 --> 01:41:01,104
who do you think
he will come for next?

1328
01:41:07,811 --> 01:41:12,113
We will not help you.

1329
01:41:40,720 --> 01:41:41,891
Everything is on schedule.

1330
01:41:42,054 --> 01:41:43,225
Have the spies been alerted?

1331
01:41:43,389 --> 01:41:45,516
Yes. Some resistance
to our new mission.

1332
01:41:45,890 --> 01:41:47,393
But the War Dogs in London,

1333
01:41:47,475 --> 01:41:49,274
New York and Hong Kong
are standing by.

1334
01:41:50,938 --> 01:41:52,564
We'll strike there first.

1335
01:41:52,731 --> 01:41:54,529
The others“ some around.

1336
01:41:54,692 --> 01:41:56,069
Look at this.

1337
01:41:56,234 --> 01:41:57,327
A handheld sonic cannon,

1338
01:41:57,403 --> 01:41:58,779
powerful enough
to stop a tank...

1339
01:41:58,945 --> 01:42:00,573
untraceable by metal detectors.

1340
01:42:00,739 --> 01:42:02,787
And we got thousands of them.

1341
01:42:04,952 --> 01:42:08,081
The world's gonna find out
exactly who we are.

1342
01:42:39,612 --> 01:42:40,828
He lives.

1343
01:42:44,867 --> 01:42:46,789
N'Jadaka!

1344
01:42:47,994 --> 01:42:49,247
Wassup?

1345
01:42:49,412 --> 01:42:51,164
I never yielded!

1346
01:42:51,916 --> 01:42:55,636
And as you can see,
I am not dead!

1347
01:42:56,170 --> 01:42:58,264
All that challenge shit
is over with!

1348
01:42:58,338 --> 01:42:59,465
I'm the king now!

1349
01:42:59,631 --> 01:43:01,850
Get those planes in the air!
Carry out the mission!

1350
01:43:10,309 --> 01:43:11,902
- Shuri, now.
- Copy that.

1351
01:43:15,271 --> 01:43:17,990
Go, go, go! Come on, Ross!

1352
01:43:18,149 --> 01:43:20,618
W'Kabi, man, kill this clown.

1353
01:43:21,737 --> 01:43:24,832
W'Kabi, the challenge
is not complete.

1354
01:43:28,868 --> 01:43:30,041
What will we do?

1355
01:43:31,454 --> 01:43:32,546
Border Tribe!

1356
01:43:46,595 --> 01:43:47,595
You!

1357
01:43:47,762 --> 01:43:50,106
Your heart
is so full of hatred...

1358
01:43:50,265 --> 01:43:52,109
you are not fit to be a king!

1359
01:43:56,479 --> 01:43:57,605
Come on!

1360
01:43:57,773 --> 01:43:58,774
Ayo, the king!

1361
01:44:14,372 --> 01:44:15,420
Shields!

1362
01:44:50,533 --> 01:44:51,877
W'Kabi, stop this!

1363
01:44:53,119 --> 01:44:54,622
Stop this now!

1364
01:44:58,792 --> 01:44:59,793
No!

1365
01:45:28,154 --> 01:45:30,623
Nakia and I will get control
of the Royal Talon with this.

1366
01:45:30,783 --> 01:45:32,251
So what do I do?

1367
01:45:32,408 --> 01:45:33,501
You'll have to fly it.

1368
01:45:34,369 --> 01:45:36,292
- What?
- You were a great pilot.

1369
01:45:36,454 --> 01:45:38,502
Don't worry,
I'll guide you through it.

1370
01:45:38,666 --> 01:45:40,793
It's just like riding
a hoverbike.

1371
01:45:41,502 --> 01:45:43,175
What? You guys have hoverbikes?

1372
01:45:43,337 --> 01:45:45,135
Hey, Nakia, take that.

1373
01:45:45,296 --> 01:45:48,050
- I'm not a Dora.
- Just put it on, it's armor!

1374
01:45:49,551 --> 01:45:50,599
Come!

1375
01:45:53,012 --> 01:45:54,185
Good luck, Agent Ross!

1376
01:45:54,347 --> 01:45:55,783
Yeah, I don't know
what I'm doing with this.

1377
01:45:55,807 --> 01:45:57,185
We're counting on you.

1378
01:46:09,863 --> 01:46:11,240
Wakanda forever.

1379
01:46:19,456 --> 01:46:20,457
Come on!

1380
01:46:30,967 --> 01:46:32,094
Go, go!

1381
01:46:37,975 --> 01:46:40,854
Remote
piloting system activated.

1382
01:46:41,895 --> 01:46:42,896
My God.

1383
01:46:43,063 --> 01:46:46,112
I made it American
style for you. Get in.

1384
01:46:46,274 --> 01:46:47,822
All right.

1385
01:46:53,990 --> 01:46:54,992
Yes!

1386
01:46:57,077 --> 01:46:59,796
Go! We can't let those weapons
get beyond Wakanda.

1387
01:47:01,789 --> 01:47:02,837
All right, I'm on it.

1388
01:47:19,975 --> 01:47:21,226
Lock!

1389
01:47:22,394 --> 01:47:23,610
Get him down!

1390
01:47:23,811 --> 01:47:25,404
Get the necklace!

1391
01:47:25,855 --> 01:47:27,448
Get the necklace!

1392
01:47:34,113 --> 01:47:36,207
Wakanda forever!

1393
01:47:43,998 --> 01:47:46,252
Okay, Shuri. I got 'em.
What do I do?

1394
01:47:46,417 --> 01:47:47,795
Shoot them down, genius!

1395
01:47:47,962 --> 01:47:48,962
All right.

1396
01:47:50,588 --> 01:47:51,636
Here goes nothing.

1397
01:47:58,889 --> 01:48:00,015
All right, got them.

1398
01:48:04,353 --> 01:48:05,604
Shit.

1399
01:48:06,563 --> 01:48:08,314
Shit, shit, shit.

1400
01:48:28,585 --> 01:48:29,676
Nice!

1401
01:49:04,912 --> 01:49:05,960
Shuri!

1402
01:49:10,252 --> 01:49:11,628
What's up, Princess?

1403
01:49:11,795 --> 01:49:13,889
You'll never be a true king.

1404
01:49:16,841 --> 01:49:17,842
Brother!

1405
01:49:50,000 --> 01:49:51,296
Shuri.

1406
01:49:51,710 --> 01:49:52,711
Brother!

1407
01:49:53,587 --> 01:49:55,260
Turn on the train
on the bottom track.

1408
01:49:55,421 --> 01:49:57,470
The stabilizers
will deactivate your suit!

1409
01:49:57,632 --> 01:49:58,975
You won't have protection!

1410
01:49:59,134 --> 01:50:00,476
Neither will he.

1411
01:50:00,636 --> 01:50:02,012
Okay!

1412
01:50:26,078 --> 01:50:28,331
I don't need a suit to kill you.

1413
01:50:28,497 --> 01:50:29,713
Your reign is over!

1414
01:50:29,872 --> 01:50:31,466
You sat up here,
safe and protected.

1415
01:50:31,625 --> 01:50:33,046
You want to see us become

1416
01:50:33,127 --> 01:50:35,050
just like the people
you hate so much.

1417
01:50:35,212 --> 01:50:36,963
Divide and conquer the land
as they did!

1418
01:50:37,131 --> 01:50:39,554
Nah, I learn from my enemies.
Beat them at they own game.

1419
01:50:39,716 --> 01:50:40,967
You have become them!

1420
01:50:41,260 --> 01:50:43,637
You will destroy the world,
Wakanda included!

1421
01:50:43,804 --> 01:50:45,555
The world took
everything away from me!

1422
01:50:45,721 --> 01:50:47,224
Everything I ever loved!

1423
01:50:47,390 --> 01:50:48,859
But I'mma make sure we're even.

1424
01:50:49,016 --> 01:50:50,203
L'mma track down
anyone who would

1425
01:50:50,226 --> 01:50:51,729
even think
about being loyal to you!

1426
01:50:51,895 --> 01:50:53,288
And I'm gonna put
they ass in the dirt

1427
01:50:53,313 --> 01:50:54,404
right next to Zuri!

1428
01:50:56,692 --> 01:50:57,988
Nakia!

1429
01:51:01,113 --> 01:51:02,911
- Are you all right?
- I'm okay. You?

1430
01:51:03,073 --> 01:51:04,824
- Yes.
- Let's go.

1431
01:51:11,957 --> 01:51:14,255
Shuri, I've lost one of them,
but two are on my tail.

1432
01:51:16,670 --> 01:51:17,886
Shit. What the hell was that?

1433
01:51:18,046 --> 01:51:19,389
The lab is under attack.

1434
01:51:19,463 --> 01:51:20,511
What? Where?

1435
01:51:20,591 --> 01:51:22,514
Deactivating hologram.

1436
01:51:26,555 --> 01:51:29,399
SHURY: Ross, you have to
get out of there, now!

1437
01:51:29,975 --> 01:51:31,351
How long have I got?

1438
01:51:32,060 --> 01:51:35,109
Glass integrity is at 50%.

1439
01:51:35,898 --> 01:51:36,944
Put me back in.

1440
01:51:37,106 --> 01:51:38,824
Ross! Ross!

1441
01:51:57,711 --> 01:51:59,212
Surrender now!

1442
01:51:59,671 --> 01:52:02,550
You have three seconds
to lay down your weapon!

1443
01:52:02,716 --> 01:52:03,841
One!

1444
01:52:03,966 --> 01:52:04,967
Two!

1445
01:52:15,020 --> 01:52:19,274
Witness the might
of the Jabari firsthand!

1446
01:53:00,356 --> 01:53:02,701
Glass integrity is at 15%.

1447
01:53:11,576 --> 01:53:13,543
- Critical weapons failure.
- Shit!

1448
01:53:18,750 --> 01:53:20,377
Hey, Shuri! The last cargo ship

1449
01:53:20,460 --> 01:53:21,712
is almost at the border...

1450
01:53:21,877 --> 01:53:23,189
but they got me trapped
with some kind of cables.

1451
01:53:23,212 --> 01:53:24,510
Make an X with your arms!

1452
01:53:25,298 --> 01:53:27,518
Sonic Overload initiated.

1453
01:53:28,301 --> 01:53:29,519
Now break it!

1454
01:53:38,436 --> 01:53:40,359
System rebooting in five...

1455
01:53:40,814 --> 01:53:42,908
four, three...

1456
01:53:43,065 --> 01:53:44,693
two, one.

1457
01:53:45,277 --> 01:53:46,403
System rebooted.

1458
01:53:58,707 --> 01:54:00,050
Yes! We did it!

1459
01:54:00,207 --> 01:54:01,755
SHURY: Great!
Now get out of there!

1460
01:54:12,929 --> 01:54:14,225
Charge!

1461
01:54:34,033 --> 01:54:36,377
Drop your weapon!

1462
01:54:37,912 --> 01:54:40,086
Would you kill me, my love?

1463
01:54:40,247 --> 01:54:41,716
For Wakanda?

1464
01:54:45,002 --> 01:54:46,720
Without question!

1465
01:55:30,715 --> 01:55:32,261
This is it for you, Cousin.

1466
01:55:57,993 --> 01:55:59,539
Hell of a move!

1467
01:56:20,724 --> 01:56:22,317
My pop said Wakanda was

1468
01:56:22,391 --> 01:56:23,984
the most beautiful thing
he ever seen.

1469
01:56:27,689 --> 01:56:30,192
He promised he was gonna
show it to me one day.

1470
01:56:31,859 --> 01:56:33,453
You believe that?

1471
01:56:34,320 --> 01:56:35,447
Kid from Oakland,

1472
01:56:35,529 --> 01:56:37,407
running around
believing in fairy tales.

1473
01:57:25,788 --> 01:57:27,712
It's beautiful.

1474
01:57:41,887 --> 01:57:44,310
Maybe we can still heal you.

1475
01:57:46,725 --> 01:57:47,898
Why?

1476
01:57:49,688 --> 01:57:51,907
So you can just lock me up?

1477
01:57:55,150 --> 01:57:56,493
Nah.

1478
01:57:58,697 --> 01:58:00,369
Just bury me in the ocean...

1479
01:58:00,532 --> 01:58:03,081
with my ancestors
thatjumped from the ships.

1480
01:58:03,909 --> 01:58:07,288
'Cause they knew
death was better than bondage.

1481
01:59:31,831 --> 01:59:32,832
Thank you.

1482
01:59:34,833 --> 01:59:36,426
You saved me.

1483
01:59:37,337 --> 01:59:39,465
You saved my family.

1484
01:59:41,675 --> 01:59:43,096
Our nation.

1485
01:59:43,259 --> 01:59:45,603
There's nothing to thank me for.

1486
01:59:45,761 --> 01:59:47,309
It is our duty to...

1487
01:59:50,934 --> 01:59:53,608
It was my duty to fight
for what I love.

1488
01:59:54,645 --> 01:59:55,646
I should've...

1489
02:00:02,362 --> 02:00:04,581
You can't blame me,
I almost died.

1490
02:00:08,243 --> 02:00:09,494
(Sta)'-

1491
02:00:11,954 --> 02:00:13,207
I think I know a way

1492
02:00:13,288 --> 02:00:15,542
you can still fulfill
your calling.

1493
02:00:16,710 --> 02:00:18,131
Please stay.

1494
02:00:51,243 --> 02:00:52,996
He moves it! He moves it!

1495
02:00:53,162 --> 02:00:54,836
- Who man is that?
- Bucket!

1496
02:00:54,997 --> 02:00:55,998
Easy.

1497
02:00:59,002 --> 02:01:00,345
When you said you would take me

1498
02:01:00,420 --> 02:01:02,342
to California
for the first time...

1499
02:01:02,505 --> 02:01:04,472
I thought you meant Coachella...

1500
02:01:04,631 --> 02:01:06,100
or Disneyland.

1501
02:01:06,760 --> 02:01:08,181
Why here?

1502
02:01:11,305 --> 02:01:14,775
This is where our father
killed our uncle.

1503
02:01:19,980 --> 02:01:21,733
They're tearing it down.

1504
02:01:22,817 --> 02:01:23,818
Good.

1505
02:01:23,984 --> 02:01:25,987
They are not tearing it down.

1506
02:01:27,113 --> 02:01:28,739
I bought this building.

1507
02:01:30,783 --> 02:01:32,707
And that building.

1508
02:01:33,536 --> 02:01:35,287
And that one over there.

1509
02:01:36,497 --> 02:01:37,795
This will be the first.

1510
02:01:37,873 --> 02:01:40,217
Wakandan International
Outreach Center.

1511
02:01:41,461 --> 02:01:44,135
Nakia will oversee
the social outreach.

1512
02:01:44,881 --> 02:01:46,132
And you will spearhead

1513
02:01:46,216 --> 02:01:48,389
the science
and information exchange.

1514
02:01:49,092 --> 02:01:51,060
You're kidding.

1515
02:02:03,106 --> 02:02:06,030
Hey, yo.
Man, what the hell is that?

1516
02:02:06,194 --> 02:02:07,912
That's like a Bugatti spaceship!

1517
02:02:08,070 --> 02:02:10,664
Bro, it came out of nowhere.
Did y'all see that?

1518
02:02:13,784 --> 02:02:14,957
What?

1519
02:02:16,787 --> 02:02:17,788
Check it out, bro.

1520
02:02:17,956 --> 02:02:19,332
We can take this back
to the house.

1521
02:02:20,625 --> 02:02:21,716
Pull up to school in this.

1522
02:02:21,792 --> 02:02:23,761
Look, we can break it apart.
We can sell it.

1523
02:02:23,837 --> 02:02:24,837
On eBay.

1524
02:02:24,921 --> 02:02:26,148
Everybody get, like,
a million apiece.

1525
02:02:26,171 --> 02:02:27,483
I wouldn't do that
if I were you guys.

1526
02:02:27,506 --> 02:02:28,692
- Where you come from?
- From Wakanda.

1527
02:02:28,716 --> 02:02:29,841
What is a Wakanda?

1528
02:02:29,926 --> 02:02:30,926
Hey, yo!

1529
02:02:31,636 --> 02:02:32,853
This yours?

1530
02:02:36,640 --> 02:02:37,984
Who...

1531
02:02:38,350 --> 02:02:39,523
Who are you?

1532
02:05:25,518 --> 02:05:27,690
My name is King T'Challa...

1533
02:05:27,854 --> 02:05:29,981
son of King T'Chaka.

1534
02:05:30,148 --> 02:05:34,493
I am the sovereign ruler
of the nation of Wakanda.

1535
02:05:34,652 --> 02:05:37,404
And for the first time
in our history...

1536
02:05:37,572 --> 02:05:40,792
we will be sharing
our knowledge and resources...

1537
02:05:40,949 --> 02:05:42,827
with the outside world.

1538
02:05:42,993 --> 02:05:46,372
Wakanda will no longer
watch from the shadows.

1539
02:05:46,538 --> 02:05:47,961
We cannot.

1540
02:05:49,082 --> 02:05:50,585
We must not.

1541
02:05:50,917 --> 02:05:53,546
We will work to be an example
of how we...

1542
02:05:53,712 --> 02:05:55,966
as brothers and sisters
on this earth...

1543
02:05:56,131 --> 02:05:58,180
should treat each other.

1544
02:05:58,341 --> 02:06:00,185
Now, more than ever...

1545
02:06:01,429 --> 02:06:05,854
the illusions of division
threaten our very existence.

1546
02:06:06,266 --> 02:06:08,189
We all know the truth.

1547
02:06:08,351 --> 02:06:11,777
More connects us
than separates us.

1548
02:06:11,939 --> 02:06:13,657
But in times of crisis...

1549
02:06:13,815 --> 02:06:16,284
the wise build bridges...

1550
02:06:16,444 --> 02:06:19,243
while the foolish
build barriers.

1551
02:06:19,404 --> 02:06:21,453
We must find a way...

1552
02:06:21,615 --> 02:06:24,243
to look after one another...

1553
02:06:24,409 --> 02:06:29,131
as if we were one, single tribe.

1554
02:06:29,289 --> 02:06:30,757
With all due respect,
King T'ChaHa...

1555
02:06:30,917 --> 02:06:32,168
what can a nation of farmers

1556
02:06:32,251 --> 02:06:34,127
have to offer
the rest of the world?

1557
02:13:33,713 --> 02:13:35,716
Are you playing around
with that man again?

1558
02:13:35,798 --> 02:13:37,078
- No.
- You're teasing him again.

1559
02:13:38,219 --> 02:13:40,346
- Don't wake him. He must rest.
- No, I'm not.

1560
02:13:41,305 --> 02:13:42,681
No, I'm not.

1561
02:13:43,640 --> 02:13:44,858
Thabo, you're doing that.

1562
02:13:45,016 --> 02:13:46,394
He's doing it. He's lying.

1563
02:13:46,560 --> 02:13:47,981
No, he's resting.

1564
02:13:48,270 --> 02:13:49,487
Go, go!

1565
02:13:49,646 --> 02:13:51,444
KIDS: White Wolf!

1566
02:13:51,564 --> 02:13:52,612
SHURII Stop that!

1567
02:13:52,733 --> 02:13:53,859
KIDS: White Wolf!

1568
02:13:56,612 --> 02:13:58,238
Good morning, Sergeant Barnes.

1569
02:13:59,739 --> 02:14:00,740
Bucky.

1570
02:14:02,368 --> 02:14:03,414
How are you feeling?

1571
02:14:04,036 --> 02:14:05,037
Good.

1572
02:14:07,664 --> 02:14:08,756
Thank you.

1573
02:14:08,832 --> 02:14:10,378
Come.

1574
02:14:11,877 --> 02:14:13,753
Much more for you to learn.
