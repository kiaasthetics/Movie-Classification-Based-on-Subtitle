1
00:01:12,760 --> 00:01:14,120
It's 12:00 noon in London.

2
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:15,919
7:00 a.m. in Philadelphia.

3
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:19,039
And around the world,
it's time for Live Aid.

4
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:21,431
Wembley welcomes
their Royal Highnesses...

5
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:24,075
the Prince
and Princess of Wales.

6
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:28,440
David, look at me.

7
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:03,919
Oi! You missed one, Pakkie!

8
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:05,990
I'm not from Pakistan.

9
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:30,160
Dinner is ready.

10
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:31,549
I'm not hungry, Mum.

11
00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:32,960
Hmm, where are you going?

12
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:36,031
- Out with friends.
- A girl?

13
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:38,996
- Oh, Mum.
- Look at you.

14
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:40,794
Give your mother
a kiss.

15
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:45,875
I'm going to be late.

16
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:47,360
You're always late.

17
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:49,796
Hi, Papa.
How was work?

18
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:54,200
Out again, Farrokh?

19
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:55,840
It's Freddie now, Papa.

20
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:57,912
Freddie or Farrokh...

21
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:00,136
what difference does it make
when you're out every night...

22
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:01,833
no thought of the future
in your head?

23
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:05,915
Good thoughts,
good words, good deeds.

24
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:07,799
That's what
you should aspire to.

25
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:08,960
Yes.

26
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:11,231
And how's that
worked out for you?

27
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:37,313
Yeah, they're better
than last week.

28
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:39,256
- They're a cool band.
- Yeah, not bad.

29
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:40,280
Yeah.

30
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:49,216
What can I get for you?

31
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:50,240
Pint of lager.

32
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:54,800
- Thank you.
- Thanks.

33
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:35,715
See you, mate.

34
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:37,750
Humpy Bong?

35
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:39,115
Humpy Bong.

36
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:40,960
They're going places.
They're gonna be big.

37
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:42,998
Humpy Bong?
Are you joking?

38
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:44,160
Don't do it, Tim.

39
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:45,360
No, I'm sorry, guys,
but...

40
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:47,233
we're not going anywhere
with this.

41
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:49,630
What? College gigs, pubs?

42
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:52,880
Gotta give it a go.

43
00:06:56,440 --> 00:06:58,796
So I just said to him,
"No, you can't do that."

44
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:00,713
You literally
can't hear anything.

45
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:03,429
It's a bit silly.

46
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:06,840
But then everyone else was
in, like, long dresses?

47
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:08,954
How bizarre.

48
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:14,470
You all right?

49
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:19,831
Sorry. Oh, I was just
looking for the band.

50
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:21,633
They're usually out back.

51
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:31,160
I like your coat.

52
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:36,237
It's from Biba.

53
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:39,869
She works there.

54
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:41,680
Thank you.

55
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:47,510
I think he's right.

56
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:48,960
That show
was a load of bollocks.

57
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,469
Well, there was room
for improvement, yeah.

58
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:54,036
I've got better things to do
with my Saturday nights.

59
00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:56,194
I could give you
their names.

60
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:01,320
I enjoyed the show.

61
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:03,274
- Thanks, man.
- Thank you.

62
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:07,520
I've been following you
for a while, actually.

63
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:09,200
Smile.

64
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,390
Makes sense
for a dental student.

65
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:14,791
And you're astrophysics,
aren't you?

66
00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:17,197
- Yeah.
- Makes you the clever one.

67
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:19,394
Yeah, I suppose
it does, yeah.

68
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:20,920
I study design here.

69
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:22,150
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

70
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:24,880
Also, um, I write songs.

71
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:27,598
Might be
of interest to you.

72
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:29,993
It's just a bit of fun,
really.

73
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:31,959
Well, you're
five minutes too late.

74
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:34,033
Our lead singer
just quit.

75
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,673
Well, then you'll need
someone new.

76
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:41,116
Any ideas?

77
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:45,630
What about me?

78
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:48,675
Uh, not with those teeth,
mate.

79
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:02,715
I know what I'm doin'

80
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:04,799
I got a feeling

81
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:09,591
I should be doin' all right

82
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:15,637
Doin' all right

83
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:21,597
I was born with
four additional incisors.

84
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:24,195
More space in my mouth
means more range.

85
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:26,632
I'll consider your offer.

86
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:33,316
Uh, do you play bass?

87
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:35,870
Nope.

88
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:51,918
Excuse me. Thanks.

89
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:56,480
So, you found me, then.

90
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:58,279
- How can I help you?
- Oh.

91
00:09:58,440 --> 00:10:00,272
Um, I rather liked these.

92
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:02,193
Do you think
you have them in my size?

93
00:10:02,680 --> 00:10:05,479
This is the ladies' section,
so I'm not exactly sure.

94
00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:08,992
There wasn't a sign
or anything.

95
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:12,836
I don't think it should
really matter, do you?

96
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:21,998
I thought
you might like this.

97
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:24,873
Are you even allowed
to be in here?

98
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:26,040
No, not really.

99
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:33,560
One more thing.

100
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:35,870
May I?

101
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,151
You have such
an exotic look.

102
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:52,116
I love your style.

103
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:55,592
I think we should all
take more risks.

104
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:11,753
What do you think?

105
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:18,634
Oh, cheers.
Thank you.

106
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:20,920
Hello, everybody.

107
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:25,234
We've got a few fresh faces.

108
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:26,959
This is John Deacon,
our bass player.

109
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:29,592
Yeah, and
our new lead singer...

110
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:31,592
Freddie Bul... Bulsara...

111
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:33,474
Freddie Bulsara.

112
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:35,275
That's right.

113
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:38,160
And Roger, of course.
The biggest member of them all.

114
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:39,390
Hey, Roger!

115
00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:42,314
Hello,
all you beautiful people.

116
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:46,519
Where's Tim?

117
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:48,873
Who's the Pakkie?

118
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:50,315
Ready, Freddie?

119
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:52,200
Let's do it.

120
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:16,515
Keep yourself alive

121
00:12:33,640 --> 00:12:37,270
I was told a million times
Of all the troubles in my way

122
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:40,598
Mind you grow a little wiser
Little better every day

123
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:42,399
But if I rode a million
rivers

124
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:44,599
- And I crossed a million miles
- No, no.

125
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:46,216
- Still be where I started
- Wrong lyric!

126
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:48,000
- Bread and butter for a smile
- Wrong lyric.

127
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:51,318
Sold a million mirrors
In shopping alley ways

128
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:54,598
But I never saw my face
In any window any day

129
00:12:54,760 --> 00:12:56,752
Now they say your folks
are telling you

130
00:12:56,960 --> 00:12:58,394
Be a super star

131
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:00,472
Tell you,
just be satisfied

132
00:13:00,640 --> 00:13:02,154
And stay right where you are

133
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:05,757
Keep yourself alive
Keep yourself alive

134
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:09,357
All you people
Keep yourself alive

135
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:12,236
Learn the song, Freddie.

136
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:44,956
You're late.

137
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:51,470
This is bollocks!

138
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:58,794
It's counterclockwise,
I think you'll find, John.

139
00:13:58,960 --> 00:14:00,553
Oh, is it?
Thank you, Brian.

140
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:02,400
Would you like to do it?
Please, feel free.

141
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:03,600
No, no, no.
Doing a good job.

142
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:06,633
We sold out every
pub and uni south of Glasgow...

143
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:08,553
and I'm stuck
in the middle of nowhere,

144
00:14:08,640 --> 00:14:09,835
eating a ham sandwich!

145
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,151
Trouble is, we're just not
thinking big enough.

146
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:13,675
What have you
got in mind, Fred?

147
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:14,840
An album.

148
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:16,718
We can't afford an album.

149
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:18,519
Oh, we'll find a way.

150
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:22,360
How much do you think
we can get for this van?

151
00:14:24,080 --> 00:14:25,878
I hope you're joking.

152
00:14:28,280 --> 00:14:29,509
That's three months' wages.

153
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:30,870
And a perfectly good van.

154
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:32,679
Don't be so dramatic,
darling.

155
00:14:32,840 --> 00:14:35,719
You're recording
an album tonight. Let's go!

156
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:43,976
Don't you think
I sound like shit?

157
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,000
No, it's good.

158
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:47,277
- Can we try it again?
- Sure, yeah.

159
00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:49,230
Sure, it's your money.

160
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:50,760
Literally.

161
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:02,040
Sounds a lot better.

162
00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:03,554
We need to
get experimental.

163
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:08,040
Try bouncing us left and right
for the ah-ah-ahs.

164
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:16,759
Now dead center for the last.

165
00:15:16,960 --> 00:15:18,189
And then blast it!

166
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:19,360
Yes!

167
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:27,200
That's good, right?

168
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:32,234
Do we have time
to stack a few more?

169
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:35,040
The studio opens at 8:00,
so we got 30 more minutes.

170
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:41,560
Hmm.

171
00:15:45,560 --> 00:15:46,880
- That sounds good, right?
- Yeah.

172
00:15:55,720 --> 00:15:57,473
Oi, RT, who are these kids
in the box?

173
00:15:57,680 --> 00:16:01,469
A student band
doing some weird stuff.

174
00:16:01,640 --> 00:16:02,915
How about demos?
You got some?

175
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,559
Been up all night,
mate.

176
00:16:15,520 --> 00:16:17,113
So the new name is Queen?

177
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:19,034
As in "Her Royal Highness."

178
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:20,873
And because
it's outrageous...

179
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:23,834
and I can't think of anyone
more outrageous than me.

180
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:34,190
This is the most
impractical bed.

181
00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:47,039
That's beautiful.

182
00:16:59,880 --> 00:17:01,872
Think it has potential.

183
00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:14,116
- I have to go to work.
- I simply won't allow it.

184
00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:16,033
You're going to support me
if I get fired?

185
00:17:17,360 --> 00:17:19,238
I'll always
look after you.

186
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:20,869
I'm going to...

187
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:22,554
I'm going to be late.

188
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:36,200
How beautiful you are.

189
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:47,536
When I was a little girl...

190
00:17:47,560 --> 00:17:50,871
I used to run
around the house and hide and...

191
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:52,360
he couldn't find me.

192
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:55,160
Clever girl.

193
00:17:56,960 --> 00:17:58,096
Please tell your father
it's nice to meet him.

194
00:17:58,120 --> 00:17:59,190
I have.

195
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:01,840
Then thank him
for the lovely birthday cake.

196
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,195
I have.

197
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,993
Then tell him his daughter's
an epic shag.

198
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:10,231
Freddie,
he can read lips.

199
00:18:11,560 --> 00:18:12,560
Mary...

200
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:15,394
I can't tell you how long
I have waited for Farrokh...

201
00:18:15,560 --> 00:18:17,074
to bring home
a nice girl like you.

202
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:18,316
Farrokh?

203
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:20,995
Did Farrokh not tell you
he was born in Zanzibar?

204
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:23,112
- No, he did not.
- I used to know a girl

205
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:24,600
- who was Zanzibari.
- One minute.

206
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:26,473
I thought Freddie
was born in London.

207
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:28,916
- Oh, he was. At the age of 18.
- Shut up.

208
00:18:29,080 --> 00:18:30,673
Our family is
Indian Parsee.

209
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:32,599
- Mum. Mum, Mum.
- Mary...

210
00:18:32,840 --> 00:18:33,976
- Mum.
- Mum, please...

211
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,150
Here. Have a look at these.

212
00:18:35,320 --> 00:18:36,595
- Yes. Yeah.
- Please! Please.

213
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:38,480
- No stopping.
- We need to see those.

214
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:40,200
A thousand years ago,

215
00:18:40,280 --> 00:18:42,715
the Parsees fled to India
from Persia...

216
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:44,234
to escape Muslim persecution.

217
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:46,517
Really?
That's terrible.

218
00:18:46,680 --> 00:18:47,909
So why did you
leave Zanzibar?

219
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:49,150
We didn't leave.

220
00:18:49,320 --> 00:18:50,320
He's so small.

221
00:18:50,520 --> 00:18:52,640
We were chased out with just
the clothes on our backs.

222
00:18:52,680 --> 00:18:54,637
He was quite a good boxer,
actually.

223
00:18:55,800 --> 00:18:56,950
He had to be.

224
00:18:57,160 --> 00:18:58,296
His opponents
went for his teeth

225
00:18:58,320 --> 00:18:59,520
always trying to
punch them in.

226
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:01,637
Certainly a target.

227
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:04,360
So how old is he
in this photo?

228
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:05,536
I think three
or four years old.

229
00:19:05,560 --> 00:19:06,616
Really?
Boxing already at that age?

230
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:07,640
So good.

231
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:11,400
Mercury?

232
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:13,200
No looking back.

233
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:15,036
Only forward.

234
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:17,120
So now the family name's
not good enough for you?

235
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:18,594
It's just a stage name.

236
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:20,837
No, it's not.

237
00:19:22,040 --> 00:19:23,315
I changed it legally.

238
00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:25,472
Got a new passport
and everything.

239
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:28,953
Kash, how old are you here?

240
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:30,120
I don't know.

241
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:31,856
It was before Freddie went off
to boarding school.

242
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:34,440
I sent Farrokh away to make
a good Parsee boy of him.

243
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:35,795
He was too wild and unruly.

244
00:19:35,960 --> 00:19:37,155
But what good did it do?

245
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:40,034
Good thoughts,
good words, good deeds.

246
00:19:42,840 --> 00:19:43,840
You can't get anywhere

247
00:19:43,920 --> 00:19:45,096
pretending to be
someone you're not.

248
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:46,634
Who'd like some cake?

249
00:19:47,680 --> 00:19:49,239
Cake is always good.

250
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:50,400
Hello?

251
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:51,675
Just a moment.

252
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:52,840
Freddie Mercury.

253
00:19:53,800 --> 00:19:54,916
Phone call.

254
00:19:55,080 --> 00:19:56,560
Quite like
the sound of that.

255
00:19:56,680 --> 00:19:59,593
Freddie tells me that you're
some sort of a scientist.

256
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:01,359
- Astrophysics, actually.
- Oh.

257
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:02,856
Yeah, my father would've
preferred it if I continued.

258
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:04,120
- When?
- That's very clever.

259
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:06,032
- He's a dentist.
- I was never a dentist.

260
00:20:06,120 --> 00:20:07,176
That's a picture
I want to see.

261
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:08,200
He's a dentist.

262
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:10,840
I see.

263
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,296
That's also quite clever,
actually.

264
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:13,640
Kash...

265
00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:14,995
what are you doing later?

266
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:16,429
Homework.

267
00:20:20,120 --> 00:20:21,296
Just making conversation.

268
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:22,320
What kind of music

269
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:23,896
was he listening to
back in those days?

270
00:20:23,920 --> 00:20:26,355
Uh, he was listening to
Little Richard.

271
00:20:27,920 --> 00:20:30,116
- Very good.
- Richard, yeah.

272
00:20:30,280 --> 00:20:32,078
And his first band...

273
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:33,356
I have an announcement.

274
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:39,030
One of the A&R men...

275
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:41,476
from EMI saw us recording.

276
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:43,359
Gave our demo
to John Reid.

277
00:20:44,520 --> 00:20:46,239
He looks after Elton John.

278
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:47,470
Oh, my God.

279
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:48,800
Mr. Reid wants to meet us...

280
00:20:49,640 --> 00:20:50,994
and possibly, even manage us.

281
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:52,915
- Shut up.
- You're joking!

282
00:20:53,080 --> 00:20:55,072
Oh, my God!

283
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:04,576
You're sure
he said 12 o'clock?

284
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:06,480
Yes. "Midday at
the pub, don't be drunk."

285
00:21:06,520 --> 00:21:07,520
That's what he said.

286
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:08,656
You look
a bit nervous, Brian.

287
00:21:08,680 --> 00:21:09,680
John, I'm fine.

288
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:10,896
You're usually
so particular.

289
00:21:10,920 --> 00:21:12,016
You just gotta be cool.

290
00:21:12,040 --> 00:21:13,872
- Wow!
- Wanker.

291
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:15,600
I didn't know
it was fancy dress, Fred.

292
00:21:15,920 --> 00:21:17,479
I've gotta make
an impression, darling.

293
00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:19,080
You look like
an angry lizard.

294
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:22,436
- It's your best work.
- Very subtle.

295
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:23,670
You gonna fly away?

296
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:27,272
Can I borrow it
for Sunday church?

297
00:21:36,760 --> 00:21:38,035
So, this is Queen.

298
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:41,839
And you must be
Freddie Mercury.

299
00:21:42,160 --> 00:21:43,310
You've got a gift.

300
00:21:43,560 --> 00:21:44,755
You all have.

301
00:21:45,240 --> 00:21:46,276
So tell me...

302
00:21:46,360 --> 00:21:47,520
what makes Queen
any different

303
00:21:47,560 --> 00:21:50,473
from all the other
wannabe rock stars I meet?

304
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:53,553
I'll tell you what it is.

305
00:21:54,440 --> 00:21:56,671
We're four misfits
who don't belong together,

306
00:21:56,760 --> 00:21:57,920
playing to the other misfits.

307
00:21:58,560 --> 00:22:00,756
The outcasts right at the back
of the room...

308
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:03,077
who are pretty sure
they don't belong either.

309
00:22:04,280 --> 00:22:06,112
We belong to them.

310
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:08,236
We're a family.

311
00:22:08,600 --> 00:22:10,080
But no two of us
are the same.

312
00:22:11,800 --> 00:22:12,995
Paul.

313
00:22:13,160 --> 00:22:14,355
Paul Prenter...

314
00:22:14,680 --> 00:22:16,160
meet Queen...

315
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:18,200
our new signing.

316
00:22:18,360 --> 00:22:20,397
Paul will be looking after
your day-to-day.

317
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:21,480
Pleasure.

318
00:22:21,560 --> 00:22:22,800
If I can get you
on the radio...

319
00:22:22,840 --> 00:22:24,399
maybe I can get you
on television.

320
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:26,632
- Top of the Pops?
- Hopefully.

321
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:27,720
And then?

322
00:22:27,800 --> 00:22:28,800
And then...

323
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:29,880
it's only the biggest

324
00:22:29,960 --> 00:22:31,096
television program
in the country.

325
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:32,474
No one's ever even
heard of you.

326
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:34,438
Look, I admire
your enthusiasm.

327
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:36,319
If it goes well,
if it happens...

328
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:39,552
I've got a promotional tour
of Japan in mind.

329
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:42,234
We'll want more.

330
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:43,550
Every band wants more.

331
00:22:43,720 --> 00:22:45,598
Every band's not Queen.

332
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:51,680
- Listen, I understand.
- Hurry up.

333
00:22:51,720 --> 00:22:53,256
I understand that
it's the policy of the BBC.

334
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:54,896
- We have procedures.
- This is shit!

335
00:22:54,920 --> 00:22:56,680
I need you to explain it
to the band, please.

336
00:22:56,760 --> 00:22:58,256
- Okay, let's make it quick.
- Freddie, boys.

337
00:22:58,280 --> 00:23:00,556
Look, chaps,
it is going to be playback.

338
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:01,856
Lip synch's
all that's required.

339
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:03,400
We do know how to
play our instruments.

340
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:05,034
You want me to lip synch?

341
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:07,317
I don't understand
why we can't simply perform live.

342
00:23:07,480 --> 00:23:09,176
The audience
will never know the difference.

343
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:10,480
We'll know
the bloody difference.

344
00:23:10,560 --> 00:23:11,560
This is the BBC.

345
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:13,296
That's how things are done
around here. All right?

346
00:23:13,320 --> 00:23:14,674
Don't be a nuisance.

347
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:17,399
Freddie, it'll be great.

348
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:22,000
You'll just have to make sure
no one's looking at your lips.

349
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:23,736
Well,
the way things are done

350
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:25,274
are a load of bollocks,
old chap.

351
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:26,476
This is the BBC.

352
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:28,120
I'm relieved.

353
00:23:28,280 --> 00:23:29,509
You would be.

354
00:23:29,720 --> 00:23:30,870
Perfect performance.

355
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:34,476
She's a Killer Queen

356
00:23:34,680 --> 00:23:36,239
Gunpowder, gelatine

357
00:23:36,680 --> 00:23:38,558
Dynamite with a laser beam

358
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:41,076
Guaranteed to blow your mind

359
00:23:41,240 --> 00:23:42,913
Anytime

360
00:23:50,040 --> 00:23:52,236
Number two,
only above the waist.

361
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:54,200
Camera up!

362
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:56,957
Camera two!
No one wants to see this

363
00:23:57,080 --> 00:23:58,355
while they're eating
their meal.

364
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:02,194
Drop of a hat
she's as willing as

365
00:24:02,360 --> 00:24:04,272
Playful as a pussy cat

366
00:24:04,440 --> 00:24:06,272
Momentarily out of action

367
00:24:06,440 --> 00:24:08,033
Temporarily out of gas

368
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:11,511
To absolutely drive you
wild, wild

369
00:24:19,160 --> 00:24:22,039
What was it like singing
for all those people?

370
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:25,432
When I know
they're listening...

371
00:24:26,560 --> 00:24:28,711
when I know
I really have them...

372
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:32,514
I couldn't sing off-key
if I tried.

373
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:38,600
I'm exactly the person
I was always meant to be.

374
00:24:40,920 --> 00:24:42,991
I'm not afraid of anything.

375
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:51,232
The only other time
I ever feel that way

376
00:24:51,320 --> 00:24:52,549
is when I'm with you.

377
00:25:03,480 --> 00:25:04,834
Don't move.

378
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:09,515
Don't move.

379
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:24,517
You're the love of my life.

380
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:38,075
Freddie.

381
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:46,872
Which finger
do I put this on?

382
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:50,600
Wedding finger.

383
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:52,713
Will you marry me?

384
00:26:01,640 --> 00:26:02,869
Yes!

385
00:26:06,040 --> 00:26:07,474
Are you gonna leave it
in the box?

386
00:26:12,280 --> 00:26:14,351
Freddie, it's beautiful.

387
00:26:14,520 --> 00:26:15,749
I love it.

388
00:26:15,960 --> 00:26:17,997
Promise me
you'll never take it off.

389
00:26:18,160 --> 00:26:19,560
Oh, I promise.

390
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:21,480
No matter what.

391
00:26:21,800 --> 00:26:23,632
I love you, Freddie.

392
00:26:24,160 --> 00:26:26,629
You're going to do
such great things.

393
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:29,038
We're going to do
great things.

394
00:26:32,680 --> 00:26:33,960
Your phone's
off the hook.

395
00:26:34,520 --> 00:26:35,520
This is Crystal.

396
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:36,600
Cheryl!

397
00:26:36,680 --> 00:26:37,800
Oh, that's right.
My mistake.

398
00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:38,876
Where's your loo?

399
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:40,600
Uh, just down the hall.

400
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:43,512
Oh, come on in.
Make yourselves at home.

401
00:26:43,680 --> 00:26:44,716
Don't mind us.

402
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:46,678
Hello, Mary.
How's your dad?

403
00:26:47,080 --> 00:26:48,309
Yeah, pretty well.
Thanks.

404
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:49,616
- Good.
- What's going on, Brian?

405
00:26:49,640 --> 00:26:52,075
Well, if you'd answered your phone,
you'd know already.

406
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:54,277
This really isn't
a good time, guys.

407
00:26:56,160 --> 00:26:57,310
John Reid called today.

408
00:26:58,120 --> 00:27:00,396
He has a little tour
in mind for us.

409
00:27:00,560 --> 00:27:02,074
It's not little,
Brian.

410
00:27:03,680 --> 00:27:05,717
He's booked us a tour
of America.

411
00:27:08,800 --> 00:27:10,917
The album's hit the charts
in the U.S.!

412
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:13,596
Oh, yes!

413
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:18,039
Yes!

414
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:20,480
Yes!

415
00:27:21,960 --> 00:27:22,960
It's happening!

416
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:30,198
Now, who wants to take a ride?

417
00:28:00,560 --> 00:28:01,800
We love you, Cleveland!

418
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:04,678
We love you, Houston!

419
00:28:05,880 --> 00:28:07,712
We love you, Denver!
Very happy to be here!

420
00:28:11,880 --> 00:28:13,040
And are the crowds big?

421
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:14,496
Well, we're selling out
every night.

422
00:28:14,520 --> 00:28:15,920
I just wish you were here
to see it.

423
00:28:16,040 --> 00:28:17,520
They really love us.

424
00:28:19,320 --> 00:28:21,198
We love you, Portland!

425
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:26,439
He's got a big ass, too!

426
00:28:27,080 --> 00:28:28,753
We love you, New Orleans!

427
00:28:32,840 --> 00:28:34,797
We love you, Atlanta!

428
00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:40,976
Rog, come down here
and say hello.

429
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:42,673
We love you, Pittsburgh!

430
00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:44,991
- Roger!
- Now, hit it!

431
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:46,600
I'm good.
I just miss you.

432
00:28:46,760 --> 00:28:47,880
What are you doing?

433
00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:49,960
You can't possibly be having
any fun without me.

434
00:28:50,040 --> 00:28:51,793
Nothing as exciting
as America.

435
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:05,720
Say hi to the boys for me.

436
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:08,872
I will. Love you.

437
00:29:09,040 --> 00:29:10,394
Bye, Freddie. I love you.

438
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:09,915
Hello.

439
00:30:11,280 --> 00:30:12,794
- You're late.
- Am I?

440
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:14,360
We saved you a seat.

441
00:30:14,520 --> 00:30:15,556
- Lovely.
- Okay.

442
00:30:15,720 --> 00:30:17,040
So, now that
we're all here...

443
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:18,998
Jim, this is Ray Foster.

444
00:30:19,160 --> 00:30:20,958
Ray, this is the
band's lawyer, Jim Beach.

445
00:30:21,040 --> 00:30:22,040
Hello.

446
00:30:22,120 --> 00:30:23,320
You must stop
calling him that.

447
00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:24,396
That's his name.

448
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:27,120
No, we cannot keep
calling him "Jim Beach."

449
00:30:27,280 --> 00:30:30,717
No, that's absurd, not to
mention, unspeakably boring.

450
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:34,839
Miami.

451
00:30:34,920 --> 00:30:37,992
From now on,
I dub thee "Miami Beach."

452
00:30:39,560 --> 00:30:41,517
The sun always sets
behind you, doesn't it?

453
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:42,829
On Miami Beach.

454
00:30:44,920 --> 00:30:45,920
Hmm, right.

455
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,310
Now that everybody's
got an acceptable name...

456
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:50,199
let's get to it.
Look...

457
00:30:50,360 --> 00:30:52,317
we just really need
something special.

458
00:30:53,240 --> 00:30:54,240
More hits...

459
00:30:54,600 --> 00:30:55,750
like Killer Queen...

460
00:30:56,240 --> 00:30:57,310
only bigger.

461
00:30:57,480 --> 00:30:58,960
It's not bloody widgets
we're making.

462
00:30:59,120 --> 00:31:01,157
We can't just
reproduce Killer Queen.

463
00:31:01,920 --> 00:31:03,354
No.

464
00:31:04,920 --> 00:31:06,320
We can do better.

465
00:31:16,600 --> 00:31:17,600
It's opera.

466
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:19,559
- Opera!
- Opera!

467
00:31:20,040 --> 00:31:21,360
There seems to be
an echo in here.

468
00:31:51,240 --> 00:31:53,550
See, we don't want to
repeat ourselves.

469
00:31:53,760 --> 00:31:55,672
The same formula
over and over.

470
00:31:55,840 --> 00:31:58,958
Formulas are a complete
and utter waste of time.

471
00:31:59,120 --> 00:32:00,349
Formulas work.

472
00:32:00,560 --> 00:32:01,720
Let's stick
with the formulas.

473
00:32:02,040 --> 00:32:03,040
I like formulas.

474
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:04,839
We'll call the album...

475
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:07,432
A Night at the Opera.

476
00:32:08,440 --> 00:32:11,956
Are you aware that no one
actually likes opera?

477
00:32:12,120 --> 00:32:13,190
I like opera.

478
00:32:14,160 --> 00:32:15,913
- Do you?
- I do.

479
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:17,880
No, don't
misunderstand, darling.

480
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:19,673
It's a rock and roll record...

481
00:32:19,840 --> 00:32:21,069
with the scale of opera...

482
00:32:21,240 --> 00:32:23,118
the pathos of Greek tragedy...

483
00:32:23,280 --> 00:32:25,431
the wit of Shakespeare...

484
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:29,310
the unbridled joy
of musical theater.

485
00:32:29,640 --> 00:32:31,836
- It's a musical experience.
- Yeah.

486
00:32:31,920 --> 00:32:33,673
Rather than just
another record.

487
00:32:34,040 --> 00:32:35,997
Something for everyone...

488
00:32:36,160 --> 00:32:37,196
something...

489
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:39,550
Hmm.

490
00:32:39,640 --> 00:32:41,916
Something that will make
people feel belongs to them.

491
00:32:42,320 --> 00:32:44,710
We'll mix genres,
we'll cross boundaries...

492
00:32:46,840 --> 00:32:48,797
we'll speak in bloody tongues
if we want to.

493
00:32:49,720 --> 00:32:51,632
There's no musical ghetto
that can contain us.

494
00:32:51,800 --> 00:32:53,520
- That's it.
- No one knows what Queen means

495
00:32:53,560 --> 00:32:55,631
because it doesn't mean
one thing.

496
00:32:58,920 --> 00:33:00,070
What do you think, John?

497
00:33:00,520 --> 00:33:01,636
I...

498
00:33:02,400 --> 00:33:03,436
agree with the band.

499
00:33:03,520 --> 00:33:04,636
Of course you do.

500
00:33:06,360 --> 00:33:07,510
How about you, uh...

501
00:33:07,960 --> 00:33:10,429
- Miami.
- Hmm.

502
00:33:10,520 --> 00:33:11,954
Fortune favors the bold.

503
00:33:13,720 --> 00:33:15,200
Surely, a man of your...

504
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:18,154
unique taste...

505
00:33:18,440 --> 00:33:20,591
isn't afraid
of a little risk?

506
00:33:23,160 --> 00:33:24,879
Please don't make me
regret this.

507
00:33:26,080 --> 00:33:27,560
You're fun.

508
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:40,917
Recording studio?

509
00:33:42,800 --> 00:33:45,599
Well, the idea was to get away
from all distractions.

510
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:49,669
Right, I know it's not
the Ritz. Not even close.

511
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:52,951
- Roger, you're in here.
- Right.

512
00:33:53,120 --> 00:33:55,237
Freddie, this is you.
Biggest room.

513
00:33:55,920 --> 00:33:57,752
Brian, that's you.

514
00:33:57,920 --> 00:34:00,116
John, you're downstairs.

515
00:34:06,600 --> 00:34:07,795
And...

516
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:10,838
this is all yours, John.

517
00:34:11,400 --> 00:34:13,676
Smaller rooms
don't get nearly as cold.

518
00:34:15,840 --> 00:34:17,115
Okay.

519
00:34:36,720 --> 00:34:37,720
Hmm.

520
00:34:47,080 --> 00:34:49,231
Oh, that's really good.

521
00:35:04,640 --> 00:35:09,510
Love of my life, you've hurt me

522
00:35:11,240 --> 00:35:15,280
You've broken my heart

523
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:21,960
And now you leave me

524
00:35:23,240 --> 00:35:27,837
Love of my life,
can't you see?

525
00:35:29,560 --> 00:35:33,554
Bring it back, bring it back

526
00:35:34,640 --> 00:35:36,916
Bring it back,
bring it back

527
00:35:37,080 --> 00:35:41,199
Don't take it away from me

528
00:35:41,360 --> 00:35:45,400
Because you don't know

529
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:50,476
What it means to me

530
00:35:53,800 --> 00:35:54,836
Hmm.

531
00:36:00,120 --> 00:36:01,349
It's beautiful.

532
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:09,000
What's it called?

533
00:36:10,720 --> 00:36:13,315
Love of My Life.
I wrote it for Mary.

534
00:36:14,120 --> 00:36:15,270
If you say so.

535
00:36:56,240 --> 00:36:58,471
Don't misunderstand, Paul.

536
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:03,314
Mary knows me in a way
that no one else ever will.

537
00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:08,553
I know you, Freddie Mercury.

538
00:37:08,720 --> 00:37:10,473
Is that what you think?

539
00:37:10,640 --> 00:37:12,597
Oh, no, you don't know me.

540
00:37:13,360 --> 00:37:15,397
You just see
what you want to see.

541
00:37:16,040 --> 00:37:18,271
We work together.
That's all.

542
00:37:26,240 --> 00:37:27,993
I put my heart and soul
into this song.

543
00:37:28,160 --> 00:37:29,310
No one is disputing that.

544
00:37:29,480 --> 00:37:30,480
And you don't like it

545
00:37:30,600 --> 00:37:32,016
because you want
your songs on the album!

546
00:37:32,040 --> 00:37:34,077
- It's not that, Roger.
- Then what is it?

547
00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:36,756
I'm in Love with My Car.

548
00:37:38,120 --> 00:37:39,679
Maybe it's not
strong enough?

549
00:37:39,840 --> 00:37:41,336
What does that even
mean, "not strong enough"?

550
00:37:41,360 --> 00:37:43,033
I know I'm late.
What did I miss?

551
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:44,429
Discussing Roger's
car song.

552
00:37:44,600 --> 00:37:46,496
Is it strong enough?
That's all I'm asking.

553
00:37:46,520 --> 00:37:48,671
If I'm on my own here,
then I apologize.

554
00:37:48,840 --> 00:37:50,957
How does your new song go,
then, hmm?

555
00:37:53,400 --> 00:37:54,754
"You call me sweet...

556
00:37:54,960 --> 00:37:56,838
"like I'm some
kind of cheese."

557
00:37:57,720 --> 00:37:59,234
- It's good.
- Wow.

558
00:37:59,720 --> 00:38:01,632
"When my hand's
on your grease gun..."

559
00:38:01,720 --> 00:38:02,840
That's very subtle,
isn't it?

560
00:38:02,960 --> 00:38:03,960
It's a metaphor, Brian.

561
00:38:04,120 --> 00:38:05,240
It's just a bit weird,
Roger.

562
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:07,431
What exactly are you doing
with that car?

563
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:09,115
Children, please.

564
00:38:09,280 --> 00:38:10,416
We could all
murder each other...

565
00:38:10,440 --> 00:38:12,320
but then who would be left
to record this album?

566
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:14,136
Statistically speaking,
most bands don't fail,

567
00:38:14,160 --> 00:38:15,160
they break up.

568
00:38:16,040 --> 00:38:18,240
Why the hell would
you say something like that?

569
00:38:19,120 --> 00:38:20,560
Roger, there's only room
in this band

570
00:38:20,600 --> 00:38:21,795
for one hysterical queen.

571
00:38:21,960 --> 00:38:23,633
You know why
you're angry, Roger?

572
00:38:23,800 --> 00:38:24,800
Why?

573
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:27,076
'Cause you know your song
isn't strong enough.

574
00:38:30,280 --> 00:38:32,192
- Not...
- Is that strong enough?

575
00:38:33,280 --> 00:38:34,396
What about that?

576
00:38:34,680 --> 00:38:36,592
Not the coffee machine!

577
00:39:12,240 --> 00:39:14,880
Goodbye, everybody

578
00:39:15,080 --> 00:39:18,391
I've got to go

579
00:39:18,560 --> 00:39:25,512
Gotta leave you all behind
and face the truth

580
00:39:25,680 --> 00:39:31,472
Mama
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

581
00:39:32,360 --> 00:39:35,592
I don't wanna die

582
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:41,313
I sometimes wish
I'd never been born at all

583
00:40:14,680 --> 00:40:15,955
What next?

584
00:40:16,320 --> 00:40:17,436
That was pretty damn good.

585
00:40:17,640 --> 00:40:19,871
Brilliant.
I love that.

586
00:40:20,040 --> 00:40:21,216
Press the button, Freddie.

587
00:40:21,240 --> 00:40:22,799
I know,
I know where it is.

588
00:40:22,960 --> 00:40:24,314
I know where...
Knock, knock.

589
00:40:24,520 --> 00:40:25,520
Good.

590
00:40:25,680 --> 00:40:26,909
It's good. Um...

591
00:40:27,080 --> 00:40:29,117
You know,
play it like you wrote it.

592
00:40:29,560 --> 00:40:30,789
Well, I did.
I wrote that part.

593
00:40:31,480 --> 00:40:32,480
Taking the piss.

594
00:40:32,640 --> 00:40:33,756
Okay. Are you happy?

595
00:40:34,680 --> 00:40:35,875
I think it's beautiful.

596
00:40:36,240 --> 00:40:37,435
It's almost perfect.

597
00:40:37,800 --> 00:40:38,800
Almost?

598
00:40:39,720 --> 00:40:41,359
Yes, give it
more rock and roll.

599
00:40:41,520 --> 00:40:42,874
I'm always up for that, Fred.

600
00:40:43,080 --> 00:40:44,434
Put your body into it.

601
00:40:44,520 --> 00:40:45,520
Right. Okay.

602
00:40:45,600 --> 00:40:46,736
Put my body into it.
I got it.

603
00:40:46,760 --> 00:40:47,830
Not like that.

604
00:40:47,920 --> 00:40:49,376
No, I got it. I got it.
Bit more soul, yeah?

605
00:40:49,400 --> 00:40:50,595
All right.
Give it more heart.

606
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:52,029
I'll do that. We good to go?

607
00:40:52,120 --> 00:40:53,156
Roy, you good?

608
00:40:53,240 --> 00:40:55,630
Oh, and then there's
the operatic section.

609
00:40:58,080 --> 00:40:59,080
You're gonna love it.

610
00:40:59,560 --> 00:41:00,835
The operatic section?

611
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:03,856
- I know, it sounds crazy.
- I love it, Fred. I love it.

612
00:41:03,880 --> 00:41:05,160
I don't know.
It could be a flop.

613
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:06,376
- It could work.
- I love it!

614
00:41:07,640 --> 00:41:08,960
What have we got to lose?

615
00:41:09,040 --> 00:41:10,554
Nothing.

616
00:41:10,720 --> 00:41:11,836
If you say so.

617
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:13,036
Okay, let's go.

618
00:41:13,240 --> 00:41:14,240
Deacy.

619
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:30,000
How was that?

620
00:41:30,600 --> 00:41:32,637
- Freddie?
- Higher.

621
00:41:34,480 --> 00:41:35,800
Can you go a bit higher?

622
00:41:35,960 --> 00:41:37,872
If I go any higher,
only dogs will hear me.

623
00:41:38,040 --> 00:41:39,076
Try.

624
00:41:39,160 --> 00:41:40,230
Freddie's note. Sorry.

625
00:41:40,760 --> 00:41:42,200
Go on, roll the tape.

626
00:41:42,440 --> 00:41:45,035
Overdub 24 of "Fred's Thing."

627
00:41:53,640 --> 00:41:54,640
How was that?

628
00:41:54,800 --> 00:41:55,800
- Better?
- Higher.

629
00:41:56,440 --> 00:41:58,830
Jesus! How many more
"Galileos" do you want?

630
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:00,560
Freddie wants to do
a few more overdubs.

631
00:42:00,600 --> 00:42:01,760
Do we even have
any tape left?

632
00:42:01,880 --> 00:42:03,553
I do have to say
the tape is wearing out.

633
00:42:03,720 --> 00:42:04,836
It can't take much more.

634
00:42:05,040 --> 00:42:06,474
Yeah, we can't afford
much more.

635
00:42:06,640 --> 00:42:08,200
We're already
three weeks over schedule.

636
00:42:08,560 --> 00:42:12,236
Dub 26 of "Fred's Thing."

637
00:42:13,400 --> 00:42:14,400
One more, one more.

638
00:42:15,560 --> 00:42:16,789
One more.

639
00:42:18,320 --> 00:42:19,436
Again.

640
00:42:20,200 --> 00:42:21,360
Go on, roll the track.

641
00:42:23,040 --> 00:42:24,156
Who even is Galileo?

642
00:42:27,960 --> 00:42:29,840
My nuts feel like
they're in my chest right now.

643
00:42:29,920 --> 00:42:31,120
- Are we done?
- That's it.

644
00:42:31,160 --> 00:42:32,160
He loves you.

645
00:42:37,040 --> 00:42:38,110
That's it.

646
00:42:41,480 --> 00:42:43,119
It's beautiful! Love it!

647
00:43:27,520 --> 00:43:29,512
Christ.

648
00:43:33,920 --> 00:43:34,990
Well...

649
00:43:35,160 --> 00:43:36,992
I'm not entirely sure...

650
00:43:37,160 --> 00:43:38,992
that's the album
you promised us.

651
00:43:39,160 --> 00:43:41,277
No, it's better than the album
we promised you.

652
00:43:41,440 --> 00:43:42,480
It's better than any album

653
00:43:42,560 --> 00:43:44,279
anyone's ever promised you,
darling.

654
00:43:44,440 --> 00:43:45,480
It's a bloody masterpiece.

655
00:43:45,600 --> 00:43:47,398
- Christ.
- It is a good album, Ray.

656
00:43:47,600 --> 00:43:48,829
We prefer "masterpiece."

657
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:50,480
It's expensive,
and as for...

658
00:43:51,120 --> 00:43:52,315
"Bohemian..."

659
00:43:52,520 --> 00:43:53,520
Rhapsody.

660
00:43:53,760 --> 00:43:55,353
Rhapsody.
What is that?

661
00:43:55,520 --> 00:43:57,352
- It's an epic poem.
- It goes on forever.

662
00:43:57,520 --> 00:43:58,874
Six bloody minutes.

663
00:43:59,040 --> 00:44:01,120
I pity your wife if you think
six minutes is forever.

664
00:44:03,040 --> 00:44:04,235
And do you know what?

665
00:44:04,400 --> 00:44:05,936
We're going to release it
as our single.

666
00:44:05,960 --> 00:44:08,236
Not possible.
Anything over three minutes...

667
00:44:08,400 --> 00:44:11,677
and the radio stations
won't program it, period.

668
00:44:11,840 --> 00:44:14,719
And what on earth
is it about, anyway?

669
00:44:14,920 --> 00:44:16,149
Scaramouche?

670
00:44:16,320 --> 00:44:17,320
Galileo?

671
00:44:17,400 --> 00:44:19,073
And all that
"Ismillah" business!

672
00:44:19,240 --> 00:44:21,357
"Ishmillah"?

673
00:44:22,880 --> 00:44:24,394
Bismillah.

674
00:44:24,560 --> 00:44:25,710
Oh, aye.

675
00:44:25,880 --> 00:44:26,880
Bismillah.

676
00:44:27,040 --> 00:44:29,794
What's it about, anyway?
Bloody Bismillah?

677
00:44:31,880 --> 00:44:33,678
True poetry
is for the listener.

678
00:44:33,840 --> 00:44:35,911
It ruins the mystery
if everything's explained.

679
00:44:36,080 --> 00:44:37,309
Seldom ruins sales.

680
00:44:37,480 --> 00:44:39,437
Three minutes
is the standard.

681
00:44:39,600 --> 00:44:40,600
John.

682
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:42,195
Yeah, we need radio.

683
00:44:42,360 --> 00:44:44,670
Format is three minutes,
I have to agree with Ray.

684
00:44:44,960 --> 00:44:46,997
I actually think
the single's Love of My Life.

685
00:44:47,120 --> 00:44:48,120
No.

686
00:44:48,200 --> 00:44:49,296
Okay, how about John's song...

687
00:44:49,320 --> 00:44:51,312
You're My Best Friend?
You know?

688
00:44:51,880 --> 00:44:52,996
"Ooh, you make me live."

689
00:44:53,480 --> 00:44:54,960
Catchy, stronger.

690
00:44:56,800 --> 00:44:59,031
What about
I'm in Love with My Car?

691
00:44:59,200 --> 00:45:00,793
You're joking!
Oh, Jesus.

692
00:45:00,960 --> 00:45:02,076
I love it.

693
00:45:02,760 --> 00:45:04,080
Well,
that's the kind of song...

694
00:45:04,240 --> 00:45:06,471
teenagers can crank up
the volume in their car...

695
00:45:06,680 --> 00:45:08,353
and bang their heads to.

696
00:45:08,520 --> 00:45:11,831
Bohemian Rhapsody
will never be that song.

697
00:45:12,240 --> 00:45:14,709
It's a band decision,
Bohemian Rhapsody.

698
00:45:14,880 --> 00:45:16,439
- That's it.
- You're My Best Friend...

699
00:45:16,600 --> 00:45:17,636
and it's my money.

700
00:45:17,800 --> 00:45:19,234
Bo-Rap, period.

701
00:45:21,400 --> 00:45:22,400
Or we walk.

702
00:45:24,800 --> 00:45:26,553
MacArthur Park
was seven minutes long.

703
00:45:27,720 --> 00:45:28,720
It was a hit.

704
00:45:28,800 --> 00:45:31,679
Look, I'm not arguing
Bohemian whatever's...

705
00:45:31,760 --> 00:45:32,816
- musicianship.
- ...Rhapsody.

706
00:45:32,840 --> 00:45:34,877
But there's no way in hell
the station will play...

707
00:45:35,080 --> 00:45:37,231
a 6-minute
quasi-operatic dirge...

708
00:45:37,400 --> 00:45:39,232
comprised of nonsense words!

709
00:45:39,520 --> 00:45:41,193
Bismillah? Bullshit!

710
00:45:41,360 --> 00:45:44,558
I paid for this record,
so I say what goes!

711
00:45:44,760 --> 00:45:46,399
Have we no legal
recourse on this?

712
00:45:46,560 --> 00:45:47,560
Ray...

713
00:45:47,760 --> 00:45:49,400
you did Dark Side of the Moon,
didn't you?

714
00:45:51,120 --> 00:45:52,120
I did.

715
00:45:52,200 --> 00:45:54,556
Yeah, I absolutely
love that record.

716
00:45:55,720 --> 00:45:57,393
Legally, no.

717
00:45:57,920 --> 00:46:00,230
No, he's got all your balls
in a vice.

718
00:46:01,080 --> 00:46:02,176
It's a different matter
in the court

719
00:46:02,200 --> 00:46:03,634
of public opinion,
of course.

720
00:46:04,560 --> 00:46:07,792
Ray Foster's a giant name
in the music industry, but...

721
00:46:09,200 --> 00:46:10,759
to the average person...

722
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:14,071
Say the name Queen,
on the other hand...

723
00:46:16,520 --> 00:46:18,512
ears prick up.

724
00:46:28,840 --> 00:46:31,878
We're going with
You're My Best Friend.

725
00:46:31,960 --> 00:46:32,960
- Done.
- No.

726
00:46:33,040 --> 00:46:35,509
We know what we have,
even if you don't.

727
00:46:36,160 --> 00:46:39,119
It's called
Bohemian Rhapsody.

728
00:46:40,880 --> 00:46:44,635
You will forever be known
as the man who lost Queen.

729
00:46:56,840 --> 00:46:58,354
Temperamental
artists, eh?

730
00:46:58,520 --> 00:47:00,336
They're well aware
they're tied to a contract...

731
00:47:00,360 --> 00:47:01,589
but who knows
what goes on...

732
00:47:01,760 --> 00:47:03,800
inside the inscrutable mind
of the recording artist?

733
00:47:03,920 --> 00:47:04,920
Mark these words.

734
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:06,480
If they're not careful...

735
00:47:06,640 --> 00:47:07,710
by the end of the year...

736
00:47:07,880 --> 00:47:10,520
no one will know
the name Queen.

737
00:47:11,760 --> 00:47:13,194
Christ!

738
00:47:18,040 --> 00:47:20,316
You can take that
out of our royalties!

739
00:47:20,520 --> 00:47:21,840
- Twat!
- Wanker!

740
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:23,480
You can shove
your gold disks!

741
00:47:23,640 --> 00:47:24,835
You made a mistake, Foster!

742
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:26,000
Arsehole!

743
00:47:26,080 --> 00:47:27,320
You'll never have
a gold disk...

744
00:47:27,480 --> 00:47:28,755
you medium talent!

745
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:32,037
And to think
I worked with Hendrix.

746
00:47:32,240 --> 00:47:34,471
In the studio today...

747
00:47:34,560 --> 00:47:38,156
...singer Frederick Mercury!

748
00:47:38,800 --> 00:47:40,096
So what have you
got today for us?

749
00:47:40,120 --> 00:47:42,077
Have you got a little taste
of the new record?

750
00:47:42,240 --> 00:47:43,959
I'm really not supposed to.

751
00:47:44,120 --> 00:47:46,555
Oh, forbidden fruit?
Don't tempt me!

752
00:47:47,920 --> 00:47:50,116
- "I'm in Love with My Car!"
- Other side.

753
00:47:52,200 --> 00:47:54,157
"Bohemian Rhapsody."

754
00:47:54,320 --> 00:47:55,896
I didn't know Freddie
knew Kenny so well.

755
00:47:55,920 --> 00:47:57,120
The BBC won't play it.

756
00:47:57,200 --> 00:47:58,200
Nor did I.

757
00:47:58,360 --> 00:48:00,238
In fact, no one will play it
on the radio...

758
00:48:00,400 --> 00:48:01,914
so EMI won't release it.

759
00:48:02,200 --> 00:48:03,793
What's wrong
with this song?

760
00:48:03,960 --> 00:48:06,031
Nothing's wrong
with it at all.

761
00:48:06,200 --> 00:48:08,760
Except that
it's six minutes long.

762
00:48:08,920 --> 00:48:09,956
Six minutes?

763
00:48:10,040 --> 00:48:12,077
You'd have to be mad
to play it.

764
00:48:12,200 --> 00:48:13,360
Oh, you'd have to be bonkers.

765
00:48:13,400 --> 00:48:15,915
- I positively forbid it.
- Let's hear it.

766
00:48:16,880 --> 00:48:18,792
Ladies and ladies...

767
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:21,356
a Capital Radio exclusive...

768
00:48:21,520 --> 00:48:23,352
for the first time ever...

769
00:48:23,520 --> 00:48:26,115
Bohemian Rhapsody!

770
00:48:28,360 --> 00:48:31,239
Is this the real life?

771
00:48:31,720 --> 00:48:34,679
Is this just fantasy?

772
00:48:55,920 --> 00:48:59,357
So you think you can
stone me and spit in my eye?

773
00:49:01,920 --> 00:49:06,551
So you think you can love me
and leave me to die?

774
00:49:06,720 --> 00:49:09,599
Oh, baby

775
00:49:10,320 --> 00:49:13,438
Can't do this to me, baby

776
00:49:13,600 --> 00:49:14,829
Just gotta get out

777
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:17,720
Just gotta get
right outta here

778
00:49:18,800 --> 00:49:20,029
Yeah

779
00:49:32,480 --> 00:49:34,278
How much do they love him?

780
00:49:34,440 --> 00:49:36,079
Can't get enough.

781
00:49:39,600 --> 00:49:42,513
Nothing really matters

782
00:49:42,680 --> 00:49:45,320
Anyone can see

783
00:49:46,600 --> 00:49:49,672
Nothing really matters

784
00:49:50,960 --> 00:49:56,911
Nothing really matters to me

785
00:50:08,960 --> 00:50:13,796
Any way the wind blows

786
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:04,231
Tom, Jerry, can you hear me?

787
00:51:04,400 --> 00:51:06,039
Freddie,
when do I get to see you?

788
00:51:06,200 --> 00:51:08,351
I'll be home soon, darling.

789
00:51:08,680 --> 00:51:10,239
Will you put Romeo
on the phone

790
00:51:10,320 --> 00:51:11,913
so I can tell him I miss him?

791
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:14,639
Do you miss me?

792
00:51:16,520 --> 00:51:17,840
What a stupid question.

793
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:19,514
Of course I do.

794
00:51:25,360 --> 00:51:26,874
I love you.

795
00:51:27,160 --> 00:51:28,514
Good night.

796
00:51:49,200 --> 00:51:50,350
Morning, boss.

797
00:52:03,440 --> 00:52:05,716
Clean this mess up
and get rid of your friend.

798
00:52:08,320 --> 00:52:09,320
Get dressed.

799
00:52:23,800 --> 00:52:24,960
According to Brian...

800
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:27,879
it was the largest paying
audience in history.

801
00:52:38,880 --> 00:52:40,234
The whole night...

802
00:52:41,600 --> 00:52:43,432
I didn't know
if they understood a thing

803
00:52:43,520 --> 00:52:44,715
I was saying.

804
00:52:46,360 --> 00:52:47,396
And then...

805
00:52:48,280 --> 00:52:52,752
Love of my life,
you've hurt me

806
00:52:54,160 --> 00:52:56,914
You've broken my heart

807
00:52:57,080 --> 00:53:00,073
And now you leave me

808
00:53:00,280 --> 00:53:04,718
Love of my life,
can't you see?

809
00:53:05,440 --> 00:53:08,751
Bring it back, bring it back

810
00:53:08,920 --> 00:53:12,357
Don't take it away from me

811
00:53:12,760 --> 00:53:15,116
They're all singing.

812
00:53:15,280 --> 00:53:17,431
Thousands of them.

813
00:53:19,840 --> 00:53:21,991
All singing to you.

814
00:53:25,880 --> 00:53:27,837
Because it's true.

815
00:53:36,040 --> 00:53:38,509
Freddie, what's wrong?

816
00:53:38,680 --> 00:53:40,672
Love of my life,
don't leave me

817
00:53:41,480 --> 00:53:43,870
You've stolen my love

818
00:53:44,760 --> 00:53:47,798
And now desert me

819
00:53:49,160 --> 00:53:52,278
Something's been wrong
for a while now.

820
00:54:00,880 --> 00:54:02,599
Say it.

821
00:54:06,160 --> 00:54:08,072
Say it.

822
00:54:14,400 --> 00:54:17,472
I've been thinking
about it a lot.

823
00:54:23,360 --> 00:54:24,680
I think I'm bisexual.

824
00:54:28,640 --> 00:54:29,756
Freddie, you're gay.

825
00:54:48,080 --> 00:54:49,160
I've known for a while now.

826
00:54:49,240 --> 00:54:50,469
I just didn't want to
admit it.

827
00:54:54,320 --> 00:54:56,630
It's funny, really.
This is what I always settle for.

828
00:54:58,320 --> 00:54:59,674
"I love you, but..."

829
00:54:59,840 --> 00:55:02,878
"I love you, Mary,
but I need space."

830
00:55:03,040 --> 00:55:06,795
"I love you, Mary,
but I've met someone else."

831
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:09,720
And now,
"I love you, but I'm..."

832
00:55:15,800 --> 00:55:17,234
And this is the hardest,

833
00:55:17,320 --> 00:55:20,040
because it's not
even your fault.

834
00:55:34,080 --> 00:55:36,231
No, don't take it off.

835
00:55:37,040 --> 00:55:38,040
Don't take it off.

836
00:55:38,120 --> 00:55:39,793
You promised me
you'd never take it off.

837
00:55:43,080 --> 00:55:45,197
What do you want from me?

838
00:55:51,520 --> 00:55:52,920
Almost everything.

839
00:55:56,560 --> 00:55:58,836
I want you in my life.

840
00:56:00,640 --> 00:56:01,640
Why?

841
00:56:05,200 --> 00:56:07,874
We believe in each other.

842
00:56:09,480 --> 00:56:11,278
And that's everything.

843
00:56:13,680 --> 00:56:14,955
For us.

844
00:56:25,680 --> 00:56:29,515
Your life is going to be
very difficult.

845
00:57:02,240 --> 00:57:04,072
What do you think?

846
00:57:06,200 --> 00:57:07,200
Gay-er?

847
00:57:07,400 --> 00:57:09,756
Not this, darling, the house.

848
00:57:09,920 --> 00:57:11,798
Isn't it amazing?

849
00:57:11,960 --> 00:57:13,758
Mary's already
moved in next door,

850
00:57:13,840 --> 00:57:15,672
so she can visit
the cats and me.

851
00:57:15,760 --> 00:57:16,760
Uh-huh.

852
00:57:16,840 --> 00:57:18,513
Each cat will have
his own room.

853
00:57:18,680 --> 00:57:20,433
Delilah's by the kitchen...

854
00:57:20,600 --> 00:57:22,034
Miko's next door.

855
00:57:22,200 --> 00:57:24,351
Tiffany, Oscar, Romeo,
all upstairs.

856
00:57:24,520 --> 00:57:28,753
Lilly's room is even larger
than this one! Spoilt thing.

857
00:57:28,960 --> 00:57:29,960
Well, I'm not sure

858
00:57:30,040 --> 00:57:31,759
the echo is quite
pronounced enough.

859
00:57:31,840 --> 00:57:33,832
Eh-oh!

860
00:57:36,160 --> 00:57:38,311
Oh, I knew
you'd appreciate it.

861
00:57:39,560 --> 00:57:40,880
Stay for dinner.

862
00:57:41,040 --> 00:57:42,440
Anything you fancy.

863
00:57:42,640 --> 00:57:45,758
I can't.
Wife, kids, you know.

864
00:57:47,120 --> 00:57:48,474
Of course.

865
00:57:50,560 --> 00:57:52,313
Well, come on.
We'll eat off the floor.

866
00:57:52,480 --> 00:57:53,994
It's clean enough.

867
00:57:54,160 --> 00:57:55,674
Another time, Fred.

868
00:58:12,880 --> 00:58:14,155
- Hello?
- Mary.

869
00:58:14,760 --> 00:58:16,717
- Hi.
- Hello, my love.

870
00:58:16,880 --> 00:58:18,075
Hi.

871
00:58:18,240 --> 00:58:20,675
I need you to do
something for me.

872
00:58:20,840 --> 00:58:22,797
But you can't
ask any questions.

873
00:58:22,960 --> 00:58:24,416
Freddie, what are you
doing this time?

874
00:58:24,440 --> 00:58:27,558
No, I just told you...
you can't ask any questions.

875
00:58:28,760 --> 00:58:29,989
Right.

876
00:58:31,040 --> 00:58:33,635
I want you to go
to your bedroom window.

877
00:58:34,840 --> 00:58:36,399
Look out of it.

878
00:58:45,720 --> 00:58:48,599
- Do you see me?
- Yes, I do see you.

879
00:58:48,760 --> 00:58:50,638
Now, you do the same.

880
00:58:53,640 --> 00:58:54,640
Oh...

881
00:59:02,600 --> 00:59:04,080
Keep yours on.

882
00:59:06,200 --> 00:59:07,634
Come have a drink.

883
00:59:07,800 --> 00:59:09,234
- Now?
- Right now.

884
00:59:10,200 --> 00:59:11,236
It's late, Freddie.

885
00:59:12,240 --> 00:59:13,640
Come on.

886
00:59:13,800 --> 00:59:14,836
Please.

887
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:16,912
Do you have something
to drink?

888
00:59:17,680 --> 00:59:18,796
I suppose.

889
00:59:18,960 --> 00:59:20,838
Go get it.
Pour yourself something.

890
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:22,832
Pour yourself a drink,
darling.

891
00:59:24,920 --> 00:59:25,920
Do you have it?

892
00:59:29,280 --> 00:59:30,760
Yes.

893
00:59:31,560 --> 00:59:33,040
Cheers.

894
00:59:33,640 --> 00:59:35,040
Cheers.

895
00:59:36,040 --> 00:59:37,759
To you, my love.

896
00:59:39,000 --> 00:59:40,593
To you, Freddie.

897
00:59:42,800 --> 00:59:43,836
Good night.

898
00:59:44,480 --> 00:59:45,880
Good night.

899
00:59:57,800 --> 00:59:58,916
- Hello?
- Paul.

900
00:59:59,000 --> 01:00:00,000
Freddie?

901
01:00:00,080 --> 01:00:01,480
Sweetheart,
I want to throw a party.

902
01:00:01,560 --> 01:00:03,552
Okay.
Who do you want to invite?

903
01:00:03,640 --> 01:00:04,640
People.

904
01:00:04,800 --> 01:00:06,598
I want you to shake
the freak tree

905
01:00:06,680 --> 01:00:08,717
and invite anyone
who plops to the ground.

906
01:00:08,800 --> 01:00:11,838
Dwarfs and giants...

907
01:00:12,040 --> 01:00:16,319
magicians, Zulu tribesmen,
contortionists...

908
01:00:16,400 --> 01:00:18,596
fire eaters...

909
01:00:18,800 --> 01:00:21,031
and priests.

910
01:00:21,200 --> 01:00:23,237
We're going to
need to confess.

911
01:00:33,120 --> 01:00:34,600
Fill me up,
will you, Trixie?

912
01:00:34,760 --> 01:00:36,831
Marvelous, Fred!
You've outdone yourself!

913
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:39,196
Thank you, John.
I'm so glad you love it!

914
01:00:39,560 --> 01:00:42,394
Mmm. They say money can't
buy happiness, darlings!

915
01:00:42,560 --> 01:00:44,995
But it does allow you
to give it away!

916
01:00:45,600 --> 01:00:47,480
I see you and Paul
are getting along quite well.

917
01:00:47,600 --> 01:00:48,795
He's Trixie now...

918
01:00:48,960 --> 01:00:50,553
'cause he's always
up to something.

919
01:00:50,640 --> 01:00:52,313
So, tell me, Rog...

920
01:00:52,480 --> 01:00:54,995
what's the sexiest part
of a car?

921
01:01:02,520 --> 01:01:03,840
Ah!

922
01:01:03,920 --> 01:01:05,320
Well, well, well!

923
01:01:05,480 --> 01:01:06,596
Ah, your majesty!

924
01:01:06,760 --> 01:01:08,433
No, I'm not her majesty!

925
01:01:08,640 --> 01:01:10,757
We're her majesty,
darlings!

926
01:01:13,360 --> 01:01:14,999
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

927
01:01:15,160 --> 01:01:16,389
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

928
01:01:16,560 --> 01:01:18,040
- Thank you, my loves!
- Rog.

929
01:01:18,080 --> 01:01:19,639
Where's Mary?

930
01:01:19,720 --> 01:01:23,873
It's not exactly
her scene, is it, Freddie?

931
01:01:24,800 --> 01:01:25,800
Hmm.

932
01:01:27,240 --> 01:01:28,640
Fabulous, isn't it?

933
01:01:28,800 --> 01:01:29,916
If you say so.

934
01:01:33,720 --> 01:01:34,720
Hmm.

935
01:01:36,160 --> 01:01:38,038
You're starting to look
like each other.

936
01:01:38,200 --> 01:01:39,360
What's wrong with that,
Brian?

937
01:01:39,520 --> 01:01:41,176
You're supposed to be
in a rock band, Freddie.

938
01:01:41,200 --> 01:01:42,200
Not the Village People.

939
01:01:43,360 --> 01:01:45,560
You might want to think about
cutting your hair one day.

940
01:01:45,800 --> 01:01:47,519
Never.
I was born like this.

941
01:01:49,240 --> 01:01:51,232
Come on!

942
01:01:52,400 --> 01:01:53,880
- Let's dance!
- Yes!

943
01:01:54,040 --> 01:01:55,269
I don't dance, Freddie.

944
01:01:55,840 --> 01:01:57,559
I need a few more
of these for that.

945
01:01:57,720 --> 01:01:59,871
It's my party,
and I demand you dance!

946
01:02:00,040 --> 01:02:01,156
We should go.

947
01:02:01,240 --> 01:02:02,600
By royal decree!

948
01:02:02,680 --> 01:02:03,750
We're gonna go, actually.

949
01:02:04,480 --> 01:02:05,630
Oh, God! You're dull.

950
01:02:05,800 --> 01:02:07,951
If you were any more dull,
you'd be Deacy.

951
01:02:08,320 --> 01:02:09,640
What are you
complaining about?

952
01:02:09,800 --> 01:02:10,870
You've got
your little pet.

953
01:02:13,280 --> 01:02:14,509
I have...

954
01:02:14,680 --> 01:02:15,680
and he's loyal.

955
01:02:17,040 --> 01:02:19,839
Loyalty's so important.
Don't you think, Dominique?

956
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:21,195
Careful, Fred.

957
01:02:22,960 --> 01:02:24,758
- Let's go.
- Where you going?

958
01:02:24,920 --> 01:02:25,920
Home.

959
01:02:26,080 --> 01:02:27,309
Just a joke.

960
01:02:27,480 --> 01:02:30,791
Freddie, sometimes
you're a total prick.

961
01:02:31,400 --> 01:02:33,357
- Good night.
- Brian.

962
01:02:37,600 --> 01:02:38,600
Forget them.

963
01:02:38,760 --> 01:02:40,672
Come on!
Your guests are waiting.

964
01:02:40,840 --> 01:02:42,797
They all want a little
Mercury in their cup.

965
01:02:43,280 --> 01:02:44,280
Come on.

966
01:02:45,120 --> 01:02:46,349
All right!

967
01:02:47,720 --> 01:02:48,720
My darlings...

968
01:02:49,440 --> 01:02:50,954
the time has finally come...

969
01:02:51,760 --> 01:02:53,797
to get absolutely...

970
01:02:53,960 --> 01:02:55,599
shit-faced!

971
01:03:00,760 --> 01:03:04,549
Whoo!

972
01:03:04,640 --> 01:03:07,155
Senor, where's
my marching powder?

973
01:03:31,400 --> 01:03:32,800
You've got a set of balls.

974
01:03:32,880 --> 01:03:35,759
Go fetch me
a drink and find out.

975
01:03:35,920 --> 01:03:37,115
I may work
for you tonight...

976
01:03:37,280 --> 01:03:39,556
but put your hands on me
again, and I'll thump you.

977
01:03:39,720 --> 01:03:40,995
Got it?

978
01:03:41,160 --> 01:03:42,799
I'm terribly sorry.

979
01:03:43,000 --> 01:03:45,435
I didn't mean to offend you.
I'm sorry.

980
01:03:45,600 --> 01:03:47,796
I won't do that again,
all right?

981
01:03:51,000 --> 01:03:52,832
Let me get you a beer.

982
01:03:55,560 --> 01:03:56,560
I wouldn't mind a beer.

983
01:03:58,920 --> 01:04:01,560
Can you just tell me where
we keep them?

984
01:04:03,000 --> 01:04:04,832
You're very handsome.

985
01:04:05,440 --> 01:04:07,671
I love a man in uniform.

986
01:04:09,640 --> 01:04:11,438
So do I.

987
01:04:14,800 --> 01:04:16,553
So, all your friends
have left you alone.

988
01:04:16,960 --> 01:04:18,314
They're not my friends.

989
01:04:18,480 --> 01:04:19,480
Not really.

990
01:04:20,440 --> 01:04:22,272
Just distraction.

991
01:04:22,440 --> 01:04:23,669
From what?

992
01:04:23,880 --> 01:04:26,315
The in-between moments,
I suppose.

993
01:04:28,080 --> 01:04:30,390
I find them intolerable.

994
01:04:30,560 --> 01:04:31,880
All of the...

995
01:04:32,360 --> 01:04:36,877
darkness you thought you left
behind comes creeping back in.

996
01:04:38,880 --> 01:04:40,109
I know what you mean.

997
01:04:41,920 --> 01:04:43,070
Really?

998
01:04:45,440 --> 01:04:46,794
What is it that
you do with them?

999
01:04:48,640 --> 01:04:50,836
Spend them
with real friends.

1000
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:54,560
You look like
you could use a friend.

1001
01:05:15,040 --> 01:05:16,440
I like you.

1002
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:19,229
I like you, too, Freddie.

1003
01:05:22,920 --> 01:05:26,311
Come and find me when
you decide you like yourself.

1004
01:05:32,800 --> 01:05:34,598
Can I have
your name at least?

1005
01:05:36,360 --> 01:05:38,272
It's Jim Hutton.

1006
01:05:38,760 --> 01:05:40,638
- Good night, Jim.
- Good night, Freddie.

1007
01:05:40,800 --> 01:05:42,519
Or should I say good morning?

1008
01:05:46,560 --> 01:05:48,040
I want a new boat.

1009
01:05:48,200 --> 01:05:49,656
This one is for me.
This one.

1010
01:05:49,680 --> 01:05:51,096
Didn't you say
we were going to see him?

1011
01:05:51,120 --> 01:05:52,616
- I've got an hour left.
- Wait. What about this one?

1012
01:05:52,640 --> 01:05:53,736
No, I think
we'll still make that.

1013
01:05:53,760 --> 01:05:54,760
It's a good size.

1014
01:05:54,840 --> 01:05:56,194
Screw him.

1015
01:05:57,800 --> 01:05:59,359
Everyone up
on the drum risers!

1016
01:06:00,480 --> 01:06:02,392
- Up on the drum risers.
- Come on!

1017
01:06:02,600 --> 01:06:04,096
Thank you, Chrissie.
Showing some enthusiasm.

1018
01:06:04,120 --> 01:06:05,600
- Wives and everyone, Brian?
- Me?

1019
01:06:05,680 --> 01:06:06,736
Yes! Come on, John. Everyone.

1020
01:06:06,760 --> 01:06:08,360
- I'm not waiting any longer.
- Let's go.

1021
01:06:08,800 --> 01:06:09,800
Get up.

1022
01:06:09,880 --> 01:06:11,096
- Bass?
- No, you don't need it.

1023
01:06:11,120 --> 01:06:12,120
Get up.

1024
01:06:12,320 --> 01:06:14,240
- Come on, Rog, take your time.
- All right.

1025
01:06:14,520 --> 01:06:15,636
What's this about?

1026
01:06:15,800 --> 01:06:16,976
You remember our last concert?

1027
01:06:17,000 --> 01:06:19,560
The crowd were singing
our songs back to us.

1028
01:06:19,720 --> 01:06:22,315
I mean, it was deafening,
but it was wonderful.

1029
01:06:22,480 --> 01:06:24,153
They're becoming
a part of our show.

1030
01:06:24,320 --> 01:06:25,993
I want to encourage that,
so...

1031
01:06:26,440 --> 01:06:28,875
I've got an idea to involve
them a little bit more.

1032
01:06:29,040 --> 01:06:30,269
Let's start with this.

1033
01:06:32,560 --> 01:06:33,676
Stamp to this beat.

1034
01:06:35,760 --> 01:06:36,760
Genius.

1035
01:06:37,320 --> 01:06:38,549
Thank you, John.

1036
01:06:39,680 --> 01:06:40,680
Come on.

1037
01:06:41,760 --> 01:06:43,558
Good.

1038
01:06:46,400 --> 01:06:48,915
Now, I want you to clap
on the third beat.

1039
01:06:53,120 --> 01:06:54,520
Don't speed up.

1040
01:06:54,560 --> 01:06:55,880
Rog, keep that time.

1041
01:06:56,640 --> 01:06:58,552
No Prenter?

1042
01:06:59,240 --> 01:07:00,920
It's unusual to see you
without your clone.

1043
01:07:01,120 --> 01:07:02,713
It's unusual seeing you
be so bitchy.

1044
01:07:02,880 --> 01:07:04,075
It's usually me.

1045
01:07:04,680 --> 01:07:06,797
Ah, you kept time, Rog.
Good.

1046
01:07:09,400 --> 01:07:10,470
What's going on?

1047
01:07:11,360 --> 01:07:12,560
You'd know
if you were on time.

1048
01:07:13,240 --> 01:07:16,711
I'm a performer, darling,
not a Swiss train conductor.

1049
01:07:19,840 --> 01:07:21,320
Sorry I'm late.

1050
01:07:21,480 --> 01:07:22,480
Again.

1051
01:07:23,120 --> 01:07:24,120
All right.

1052
01:07:24,200 --> 01:07:25,600
Now, will you
please tell me

1053
01:07:25,680 --> 01:07:27,319
why you're not playing
any instruments?

1054
01:07:27,400 --> 01:07:30,711
I wanna give the audience
a song that they can perform.

1055
01:07:31,160 --> 01:07:32,879
All right? Let them be
part of the band.

1056
01:07:32,960 --> 01:07:33,960
So, what can they do?

1057
01:07:43,200 --> 01:07:44,475
Imagine...

1058
01:07:44,640 --> 01:07:46,279
thousands of people...

1059
01:07:46,440 --> 01:07:47,920
doing this in unison.

1060
01:07:48,480 --> 01:07:49,480
Huh?

1061
01:07:49,560 --> 01:07:50,755
Well?

1062
01:07:51,480 --> 01:07:52,550
What's the lyric?

1063
01:08:04,280 --> 01:08:06,351
Buddy, you're a boy
Make a big noise

1064
01:08:06,440 --> 01:08:09,239
Playing in the street
Gonna be a big man some day

1065
01:08:09,400 --> 01:08:11,278
You got mud on your face

1066
01:08:11,480 --> 01:08:12,800
You big disgrace

1067
01:08:12,880 --> 01:08:14,553
Kickin' your can
all over the place

1068
01:08:14,640 --> 01:08:15,640
Singin'

1069
01:08:15,720 --> 01:08:19,509
- We will, we will rock you
- We will, we will rock you

1070
01:08:21,840 --> 01:08:25,993
- We will, we will rock you
- We will, we will rock you

1071
01:08:27,840 --> 01:08:30,196
Buddy, you're a young man,
hard man

1072
01:08:30,360 --> 01:08:31,360
Shouting in the street

1073
01:08:31,440 --> 01:08:33,079
Gonna take on
the world some day

1074
01:08:33,240 --> 01:08:34,754
You got blood on your face

1075
01:08:34,960 --> 01:08:36,280
You big disgrace

1076
01:08:36,440 --> 01:08:39,274
Wavin' your banner
all over the place

1077
01:08:39,440 --> 01:08:43,070
- We will, we will rock you
- We will, we will rock you

1078
01:08:44,080 --> 01:08:45,400
Singin'

1079
01:08:45,600 --> 01:08:48,991
- We will, we will rock you
- We will, we will rock you

1080
01:08:49,080 --> 01:08:50,080
Yeah!

1081
01:08:51,240 --> 01:08:53,596
Buddy, you're an old man,
poor man

1082
01:08:53,760 --> 01:08:54,760
Pleading with your eyes

1083
01:08:54,840 --> 01:08:56,399
Gonna get you
some peace someday

1084
01:08:56,560 --> 01:08:59,632
You got mud on your face
Big disgrace

1085
01:08:59,800 --> 01:09:02,076
Somebody better put you
Back into your place

1086
01:09:02,200 --> 01:09:03,200
Do it!

1087
01:09:03,280 --> 01:09:06,717
- We will, we will rock you
- Rock you

1088
01:09:08,640 --> 01:09:12,190
- We will, we will rock you
- Rock you

1089
01:09:14,000 --> 01:09:15,195
Yeah!

1090
01:09:44,640 --> 01:09:47,360
All right! I feel like taking
a bite out of the Big Apple!

1091
01:09:49,440 --> 01:09:51,238
Who wants to take a bite
out of me?

1092
01:09:52,480 --> 01:09:54,392
All right, play with me now.

1093
01:09:56,080 --> 01:09:58,037
Eh-oh!

1094
01:09:58,120 --> 01:10:00,874
- Eh-oh!
- Eh-oh!

1095
01:10:03,240 --> 01:10:05,436
Never seen anyone interact
with a crowd like that.

1096
01:10:06,120 --> 01:10:08,112
Bigger than any band,
don't you think?

1097
01:10:10,480 --> 01:10:11,914
I mean, Queen...

1098
01:10:12,080 --> 01:10:13,878
how long can that last?

1099
01:10:14,640 --> 01:10:15,756
Did he say
something to you?

1100
01:10:16,160 --> 01:10:17,435
Not explicitly.

1101
01:10:18,120 --> 01:10:20,476
But we've had some interest
from CBS Records...

1102
01:10:20,640 --> 01:10:22,154
about a solo deal.

1103
01:10:32,880 --> 01:10:33,996
Well, that's
a big number.

1104
01:10:34,160 --> 01:10:35,799
That's a Freddie-size number.

1105
01:10:36,280 --> 01:10:38,272
You should be the one
to propose it.

1106
01:10:39,160 --> 01:10:40,514
Hi, guys. How's it going?

1107
01:10:40,680 --> 01:10:41,960
- Good.
- Everything's great.

1108
01:10:42,120 --> 01:10:43,520
John, another drink?

1109
01:10:43,600 --> 01:10:44,795
Er, no, I'm fine.

1110
01:10:45,200 --> 01:10:46,536
Here's the Coke.
Coming right up.

1111
01:10:46,560 --> 01:10:48,552
- Freddie.
- Oh, there you are.

1112
01:10:50,920 --> 01:10:52,479
Oh, God! Freddie!
Put me down!

1113
01:10:53,960 --> 01:10:55,030
You were brilliant.

1114
01:10:55,200 --> 01:10:57,157
Ah, that's only because
I knew you were watching.

1115
01:10:57,240 --> 01:10:58,240
I've missed you.

1116
01:10:58,320 --> 01:10:59,880
We have
so much to catch up on.

1117
01:11:01,080 --> 01:11:02,116
Oh, thank you.

1118
01:11:02,880 --> 01:11:04,792
This is my
boyfriend, David.

1119
01:11:05,560 --> 01:11:06,960
David, this is Freddie.

1120
01:11:08,640 --> 01:11:09,915
Magnificent show.

1121
01:11:10,920 --> 01:11:12,320
Thank you.

1122
01:11:12,480 --> 01:11:14,949
It's so kind of you,
I appreciate it.

1123
01:11:16,040 --> 01:11:17,156
Thank you so much.

1124
01:11:21,680 --> 01:11:22,680
Where's your ring?

1125
01:11:24,360 --> 01:11:26,829
I just didn't want to travel
with something so valuable.

1126
01:11:29,680 --> 01:11:31,751
Freddie, there are some people
here for you to see.

1127
01:11:32,200 --> 01:11:33,320
You promised
you'd say hello.

1128
01:11:35,920 --> 01:11:37,195
- Oh, did I?
- Mmm-hmm.

1129
01:11:39,720 --> 01:11:40,836
We should go.

1130
01:11:41,000 --> 01:11:42,000
Will I see you soon?

1131
01:11:43,440 --> 01:11:46,433
Yes, of course.
Of course.

1132
01:11:47,720 --> 01:11:48,720
Mwah!

1133
01:11:49,360 --> 01:11:50,794
It's a pleasure
to meet you, David.

1134
01:11:50,960 --> 01:11:52,110
And you.

1135
01:11:52,280 --> 01:11:53,350
And well done again.

1136
01:11:54,480 --> 01:11:55,960
And you.

1137
01:11:56,360 --> 01:11:57,360
Bye.

1138
01:11:59,160 --> 01:12:01,311
Thank you for coming
such a long way.

1139
01:12:01,480 --> 01:12:02,516
Bye.

1140
01:12:15,960 --> 01:12:17,917
Then you've got
the MTV interview...

1141
01:12:18,080 --> 01:12:21,790
and the plane to Houston
for the special.

1142
01:12:21,960 --> 01:12:23,679
Back here on Friday.

1143
01:12:25,080 --> 01:12:27,151
Listen to me now.

1144
01:12:27,920 --> 01:12:29,991
Do you know who sold

1145
01:12:30,080 --> 01:12:31,958
4% of all the records
purchased last year?

1146
01:12:32,640 --> 01:12:33,915
Worldwide?

1147
01:12:34,920 --> 01:12:36,593
Michael Jackson.

1148
01:12:36,760 --> 01:12:38,672
Not the Jackson 5.

1149
01:12:38,840 --> 01:12:39,990
Michael Jackson.

1150
01:12:40,320 --> 01:12:43,392
And I think
you could do even better.

1151
01:12:44,600 --> 01:12:47,718
In fact, I've had an offer
from CBS Records.

1152
01:12:47,920 --> 01:12:49,216
It's a lot of money
for you, Fred,

1153
01:12:49,240 --> 01:12:51,835
and I think
you should consider it.

1154
01:12:55,640 --> 01:12:58,712
Are you asking me
to break up the band?

1155
01:12:59,280 --> 01:13:03,069
I'm just pointing out what
awaits you if you go solo.

1156
01:13:03,920 --> 01:13:06,196
An end to your
frustrations.

1157
01:13:08,000 --> 01:13:09,673
My frustrations?

1158
01:13:11,240 --> 01:13:12,240
Paul?

1159
01:13:15,400 --> 01:13:17,869
I don't know what
you're talking about, John.

1160
01:13:22,360 --> 01:13:23,760
Perhaps I misunderstood.

1161
01:13:23,840 --> 01:13:25,399
Yes, sir.

1162
01:13:25,480 --> 01:13:26,480
Pull over.

1163
01:13:26,640 --> 01:13:27,869
Stop the car, pull over.

1164
01:13:30,400 --> 01:13:32,039
- Get out. Out now!
- What the hell?

1165
01:13:32,200 --> 01:13:33,416
Get out of this car.
You're fired.

1166
01:13:33,440 --> 01:13:34,496
What're you talking about,
fired?

1167
01:13:34,520 --> 01:13:35,520
I said get out.

1168
01:13:35,640 --> 01:13:37,280
- Freddie, you are high!
- I said get out!

1169
01:13:37,360 --> 01:13:38,430
What are you
talking about?

1170
01:13:38,640 --> 01:13:40,438
Out! Out or I'll kill you!

1171
01:13:42,520 --> 01:13:44,830
Get out,
you treacherous piss flap.

1172
01:13:45,000 --> 01:13:46,056
You're not
thinking clearly.

1173
01:13:46,080 --> 01:13:47,136
Get your ass
out of my car now.

1174
01:13:47,160 --> 01:13:48,160
Get out!

1175
01:13:48,920 --> 01:13:49,920
Out!

1176
01:13:50,080 --> 01:13:52,549
Get your ass out of my car!
Get out!

1177
01:13:52,720 --> 01:13:54,677
You're firing the
wrong snake, Freddie.

1178
01:13:55,040 --> 01:13:56,235
You'll regret it.

1179
01:13:56,640 --> 01:13:57,936
Get your ass out of here!

1180
01:13:59,840 --> 01:14:00,840
Drive!

1181
01:14:02,120 --> 01:14:03,759
Hey! What the hell? Move!

1182
01:14:04,320 --> 01:14:06,789
Hey, watch it!
I'll run your ass over!

1183
01:14:06,920 --> 01:14:08,832
Move!

1184
01:14:23,000 --> 01:14:25,231
Did you know
anything about this?

1185
01:14:26,760 --> 01:14:28,399
I warned him against it.

1186
01:14:29,080 --> 01:14:30,150
Pure greed.

1187
01:14:30,520 --> 01:14:32,193
Tried to break up
my family.

1188
01:14:32,400 --> 01:14:33,993
We can manage the band.

1189
01:14:34,160 --> 01:14:35,480
We don't need him.

1190
01:14:36,760 --> 01:14:38,672
What do you know
about what I need?

1191
01:14:40,160 --> 01:14:41,674
I know what it's like...

1192
01:14:41,840 --> 01:14:43,035
not to belong.

1193
01:14:43,600 --> 01:14:46,479
A queer Catholic boy
from Belfast.

1194
01:14:46,840 --> 01:14:47,840
You know...

1195
01:14:48,880 --> 01:14:52,590
I think my father
would rather see me dead...

1196
01:14:53,800 --> 01:14:55,553
than let me be who I am.

1197
01:15:00,400 --> 01:15:02,471
I'm gonna take care
of you now, Freddie.

1198
01:15:04,240 --> 01:15:05,720
If you'll let me.

1199
01:15:17,200 --> 01:15:18,680
What are you reading?

1200
01:15:19,040 --> 01:15:20,599
Just the cricket.

1201
01:15:26,200 --> 01:15:27,953
We're a rock and roll band.

1202
01:15:28,120 --> 01:15:29,349
We don't do disco.

1203
01:15:29,520 --> 01:15:31,591
- It's not disco.
- Then what is it?

1204
01:15:31,920 --> 01:15:32,956
It's Queen.

1205
01:15:33,040 --> 01:15:34,240
So sorry, my darlings!

1206
01:15:34,560 --> 01:15:35,835
Lost all track!

1207
01:15:36,000 --> 01:15:37,798
You fired Reid
without consulting us!

1208
01:15:37,960 --> 01:15:39,713
You don't make decisions
for the band.

1209
01:15:39,880 --> 01:15:40,880
Hey.

1210
01:15:42,400 --> 01:15:44,960
Well, I'm terribly sorry,
dear.

1211
01:15:45,120 --> 01:15:46,190
It's done.

1212
01:15:47,560 --> 01:15:48,676
Besides...

1213
01:15:48,840 --> 01:15:50,240
Miami will manage us.

1214
01:15:50,760 --> 01:15:52,592
Won't you, darling?

1215
01:15:52,680 --> 01:15:54,433
Erm... I'll think about it.

1216
01:15:54,600 --> 01:15:56,319
- No.
- Are you high again?

1217
01:15:56,480 --> 01:15:57,834
Well done, Columbo.

1218
01:15:58,000 --> 01:15:59,116
You need to slow
down, Fred.

1219
01:15:59,320 --> 01:16:01,391
Oh, don't be such a bore.
I'm here, aren't I?

1220
01:16:01,480 --> 01:16:02,480
Are you?

1221
01:16:02,560 --> 01:16:03,880
I don't care
if you're shit-faced.

1222
01:16:05,280 --> 01:16:06,280
As long as you can sing.

1223
01:16:08,000 --> 01:16:10,117
No, John,
I don't wanna play it.

1224
01:16:10,200 --> 01:16:11,200
Then I'm all for it.

1225
01:16:11,280 --> 01:16:12,896
What's that supposed to mean?

1226
01:16:12,920 --> 01:16:14,400
I'm tired of
the bloody anthems.

1227
01:16:14,560 --> 01:16:16,313
I want the energy
in the clubs.

1228
01:16:17,200 --> 01:16:18,200
The bodies,

1229
01:16:18,280 --> 01:16:20,016
- I want to make people move.
- You mean disco?

1230
01:16:20,040 --> 01:16:21,040
Why not?

1231
01:16:22,240 --> 01:16:24,630
Do you mind pissing off?
This is a band discussion.

1232
01:16:24,800 --> 01:16:26,678
Drum loops?
Synthesizers?

1233
01:16:26,840 --> 01:16:28,559
- If you say so.
- It's not us!

1234
01:16:28,720 --> 01:16:29,836
- Us?
- It's not Queen!

1235
01:16:30,000 --> 01:16:31,480
Queen is whatever
I say it is!

1236
01:16:32,840 --> 01:16:34,877
Well, you can play
your own bloody drums, then.

1237
01:16:36,600 --> 01:16:37,795
Fred.

1238
01:16:37,960 --> 01:16:39,840
Okay, let's see how good
a boxer you really are!

1239
01:16:39,920 --> 01:16:41,718
Roger, take it easy!
Take it easy!

1240
01:16:41,800 --> 01:16:43,376
Take it easy.

1241
01:16:43,400 --> 01:16:44,400
All right, Muhammad Ali.

1242
01:16:48,800 --> 01:16:49,800
That's...

1243
01:16:52,000 --> 01:16:53,480
That's quite a cool riff,
actually.

1244
01:16:54,040 --> 01:16:55,872
Hmm. You wrote that?

1245
01:16:57,280 --> 01:16:58,430
That's really good.

1246
01:16:59,560 --> 01:17:00,560
Yes, it will be...

1247
01:17:02,040 --> 01:17:05,158
if you all can
just shut up and play.

1248
01:17:06,200 --> 01:17:08,476
- He started it.
- Oh, shut up!

1249
01:17:21,680 --> 01:17:23,637
Steve walks warily
down the street

1250
01:17:23,800 --> 01:17:25,200
With the brim pulled
way down low

1251
01:17:25,840 --> 01:17:28,275
Ain't no sound
But the sound of his feet

1252
01:17:28,440 --> 01:17:29,760
Machine guns ready to go

1253
01:17:30,520 --> 01:17:31,715
Are you ready

1254
01:17:31,880 --> 01:17:33,200
Are you ready for this?

1255
01:17:33,360 --> 01:17:35,477
Are you hanging
on the edge of your seat?

1256
01:17:35,920 --> 01:17:37,320
Out of the doorway
the bullets rip

1257
01:17:37,480 --> 01:17:38,596
Okay, I'll do it.

1258
01:17:38,760 --> 01:17:39,955
To the sound of the beat

1259
01:17:40,120 --> 01:17:41,156
I'll do it.

1260
01:17:57,160 --> 01:17:59,160
Oh, just improvise.
Just give it whatever you want.

1261
01:17:59,240 --> 01:18:00,240
I can do that.

1262
01:18:00,360 --> 01:18:01,360
Let's go!

1263
01:18:02,600 --> 01:18:04,432
Steve walks warily
down the street

1264
01:18:04,600 --> 01:18:06,000
With the brim pulled
way down low

1265
01:18:06,880 --> 01:18:08,917
Ain't no sound
but the sound of his feet

1266
01:18:09,120 --> 01:18:10,839
Machine guns ready to go

1267
01:18:11,040 --> 01:18:13,236
Are you ready, hey
Are you ready for this?

1268
01:18:13,400 --> 01:18:15,000
Are you hanging
on the edge of your seat?

1269
01:18:15,720 --> 01:18:17,074
Out of the doorway
the bullets rip

1270
01:18:17,160 --> 01:18:18,160
Rip

1271
01:18:18,240 --> 01:18:19,515
To the sound of the beat,
yeah

1272
01:18:21,880 --> 01:18:23,553
Another one bites the dust

1273
01:18:26,400 --> 01:18:28,039
Another one bites the dust

1274
01:18:28,200 --> 01:18:30,715
And another one gone
And another one gone

1275
01:18:30,880 --> 01:18:32,280
Another one bites the dust,
yeah

1276
01:18:32,440 --> 01:18:33,480
- That's a good idea.
- Hey

1277
01:18:33,640 --> 01:18:35,040
I'm gonna get you, too

1278
01:18:35,400 --> 01:18:37,119
And then you double it,
on top.

1279
01:18:41,720 --> 01:18:43,791
How do you think
I'm gonna get along

1280
01:18:43,960 --> 01:18:45,553
Without you
when you're gone?

1281
01:18:46,000 --> 01:18:48,435
You took me for everything
that I had

1282
01:18:48,600 --> 01:18:50,319
And kicked me
out on my own

1283
01:18:50,480 --> 01:18:52,551
Are you happy,
are you satisfied?

1284
01:18:52,720 --> 01:18:54,279
How long can you
stand the heat?

1285
01:18:54,920 --> 01:18:57,355
Out of the doorway
the bullets rip

1286
01:18:57,520 --> 01:18:59,432
To the sound of the beat
Look out!

1287
01:19:03,880 --> 01:19:05,030
Freddie!

1288
01:19:05,200 --> 01:19:07,954
Freddie! Freddie,
as the leader of Queen...

1289
01:19:08,120 --> 01:19:09,190
as the leader of Queen...

1290
01:19:09,360 --> 01:19:11,511
do you feel responsible
for the success of the band?

1291
01:19:11,640 --> 01:19:14,519
I'm not the leader of Queen,
I'm only the lead singer.

1292
01:19:14,680 --> 01:19:16,558
Freddie!
A question for Freddie.

1293
01:19:16,720 --> 01:19:17,880
Do you ever
doubt your talent?

1294
01:19:18,120 --> 01:19:20,157
No, that's a stupid question.

1295
01:19:20,320 --> 01:19:21,959
- Take it easy, Fred.
- What's next?

1296
01:19:22,120 --> 01:19:23,873
Freddie, uh, your teeth!

1297
01:19:24,200 --> 01:19:25,680
Why don't you
get your teeth fixed?

1298
01:19:26,320 --> 01:19:28,596
I live in Britain.
I don't want to stand out.

1299
01:19:28,680 --> 01:19:29,750
Next...

1300
01:19:29,840 --> 01:19:31,320
Why don't you have
your manners fixed?

1301
01:19:31,800 --> 01:19:33,678
That's an asshole question
to ask anybody.

1302
01:19:33,840 --> 01:19:34,920
That's an asshole question.

1303
01:19:35,520 --> 01:19:37,512
In your song Life Is Real,

1304
01:19:37,600 --> 01:19:38,736
what do you mean
by the line...

1305
01:19:38,760 --> 01:19:39,955
"Love is a roulette wheel"?

1306
01:19:40,400 --> 01:19:42,296
Are you implying that
the more partners you have...

1307
01:19:42,320 --> 01:19:44,232
the more chances
you have of...

1308
01:19:44,720 --> 01:19:46,074
contracting something?

1309
01:19:46,240 --> 01:19:47,240
What?

1310
01:19:48,880 --> 01:19:50,997
I don't know, I haven't
figured out love yet.

1311
01:19:51,160 --> 01:19:53,117
But it implies something else,
Freddie.

1312
01:19:53,280 --> 01:19:55,351
That might be
a better question for Rog.

1313
01:19:55,800 --> 01:19:57,598
Watch it.

1314
01:19:57,680 --> 01:19:59,336
Freddie, concerning
your private life...

1315
01:19:59,360 --> 01:20:01,016
there's lots of pictures
of you in the tabloids...

1316
01:20:01,040 --> 01:20:02,269
looking drunk or ill.

1317
01:20:02,480 --> 01:20:03,960
Which one is it, ill or drunk?

1318
01:20:04,120 --> 01:20:05,998
I had a cold last week,
if anyone cares.

1319
01:20:07,000 --> 01:20:09,435
As much as we'd love to answer
questions about colds...

1320
01:20:09,600 --> 01:20:10,920
I'd like to speak
about the album.

1321
01:20:10,960 --> 01:20:12,760
If anyone's got any questions
about the music?

1322
01:20:12,800 --> 01:20:14,120
Freddie! Freddie!
Freddie!

1323
01:20:14,280 --> 01:20:16,192
Freddie! Freddie,
your parents...

1324
01:20:16,360 --> 01:20:18,113
they're conservative
Zoroastrians.

1325
01:20:18,280 --> 01:20:20,715
I wonder, what do they make
of your public persona?

1326
01:20:20,800 --> 01:20:21,800
Is that music...

1327
01:20:21,920 --> 01:20:23,400
My parents died
in a fiery wreck.

1328
01:20:23,560 --> 01:20:25,950
I happen to know
that's not true, is it?

1329
01:20:26,120 --> 01:20:28,680
I just wanted to know whether
they were proud of you.

1330
01:20:29,240 --> 01:20:31,072
Are your parents
proud of you?

1331
01:20:31,240 --> 01:20:32,720
Is this what they hoped for?

1332
01:20:32,880 --> 01:20:33,916
I hope that they are.

1333
01:20:34,080 --> 01:20:35,309
I surely don't think so.

1334
01:20:35,480 --> 01:20:37,073
Anyone wanna talk
about the album?

1335
01:20:37,240 --> 01:20:38,296
Freddie! Freddie!
Freddie!

1336
01:20:38,320 --> 01:20:39,696
Could you answer
my questions please?

1337
01:20:39,720 --> 01:20:41,200
This better be good.

1338
01:20:41,600 --> 01:20:42,600
Shut up!

1339
01:20:42,960 --> 01:20:44,976
Freddie, could you
tell us about the rumors

1340
01:20:45,000 --> 01:20:46,229
concerning your sexuality?

1341
01:20:46,760 --> 01:20:47,760
What about the rumors

1342
01:20:47,840 --> 01:20:49,513
concerning your lack
of sexuality?

1343
01:20:49,680 --> 01:20:51,831
I'm just a musical prostitute,
my dear.

1344
01:20:53,040 --> 01:20:55,032
Can you answer
the question?

1345
01:20:55,840 --> 01:20:57,069
What's your name, dear?

1346
01:20:57,240 --> 01:20:58,276
Shelley Stern.

1347
01:20:58,440 --> 01:20:59,794
- Shelley.
- Yes.

1348
01:21:00,000 --> 01:21:01,680
That thing between your legs,
does it bite?

1349
01:21:01,760 --> 01:21:02,955
Hah!

1350
01:21:03,040 --> 01:21:04,633
Could you answer the question,
please?

1351
01:21:04,800 --> 01:21:05,800
We're here as a courtesy.

1352
01:21:05,920 --> 01:21:07,136
You know, there's
four of us up here.

1353
01:21:07,160 --> 01:21:08,296
What are you afraid of,
Freddie?

1354
01:21:08,320 --> 01:21:09,480
What do you want?

1355
01:21:09,520 --> 01:21:10,520
What is the truth?

1356
01:21:10,680 --> 01:21:11,909
Can you be honest for once?

1357
01:21:12,440 --> 01:21:14,056
Why are you lying
about your parents, Freddie?

1358
01:21:14,080 --> 01:21:16,390
I'm not lying about anything.
I just, I'm...

1359
01:21:16,600 --> 01:21:18,096
Your fans deserve
to know the truth, Freddie.

1360
01:21:18,120 --> 01:21:19,296
Can you answer the question,
please?

1361
01:21:19,320 --> 01:21:20,720
This is my business.

1362
01:21:20,800 --> 01:21:21,856
No, you're a public figure.

1363
01:21:21,880 --> 01:21:22,936
What are you afraid of,
Freddie?

1364
01:21:22,960 --> 01:21:24,056
- Your parents?
- Can you tell us

1365
01:21:24,080 --> 01:21:25,160
- about...
- Your sexuality?

1366
01:21:25,440 --> 01:21:26,476
What? Why, why...

1367
01:21:26,640 --> 01:21:27,835
Can you just be honest?

1368
01:21:28,000 --> 01:21:29,056
Contracting something.

1369
01:21:29,080 --> 01:21:30,480
Your fans deserve
to know the truth.

1370
01:21:38,000 --> 01:21:39,256
Our readers want to know.

1371
01:21:39,280 --> 01:21:41,496
What do your readers want to
know? They want to know what?

1372
01:22:07,480 --> 01:22:10,473
But life still goes on

1373
01:22:11,960 --> 01:22:13,633
I can't get used to
living without

1374
01:22:13,720 --> 01:22:14,720
Living without

1375
01:22:15,080 --> 01:22:19,438
Living without you
by my side

1376
01:22:20,600 --> 01:22:23,240
I don't want to live alone

1377
01:22:24,600 --> 01:22:25,795
Hey

1378
01:22:26,000 --> 01:22:27,798
God knows

1379
01:22:29,400 --> 01:22:31,790
Got to make it on my own

1380
01:22:34,000 --> 01:22:36,959
So, baby, can't you see?

1381
01:22:38,480 --> 01:22:41,871
I've got to break free

1382
01:22:42,280 --> 01:22:43,919
Brilliant!
Can I get up now?

1383
01:22:44,080 --> 01:22:45,560
What is happening?

1384
01:22:45,840 --> 01:22:47,593
No, you can't.

1385
01:22:47,680 --> 01:22:49,672
- I wanna be in it.
- Get off me!

1386
01:23:01,520 --> 01:23:02,520
Freddie, you in there?

1387
01:23:04,080 --> 01:23:05,080
Freddie?

1388
01:23:05,800 --> 01:23:06,950
They're here.

1389
01:23:07,120 --> 01:23:09,430
We can't put this off
any longer.

1390
01:23:13,680 --> 01:23:14,909
Freddie?

1391
01:23:18,160 --> 01:23:20,072
MTV banned our video.

1392
01:23:20,240 --> 01:23:23,756
The youth of America.
We helped give birth to MTV.

1393
01:23:23,920 --> 01:23:24,990
It's America.

1394
01:23:25,160 --> 01:23:27,152
They're Puritans in public,
perverts in private.

1395
01:23:27,320 --> 01:23:28,720
I'm never touring
in the U.S. again.

1396
01:23:29,120 --> 01:23:31,874
And I'm
the one being blamed for it.

1397
01:23:32,520 --> 01:23:33,840
Not you, dear...

1398
01:23:34,000 --> 01:23:36,151
whose idea, I believe,
it was to dress up in drag.

1399
01:23:36,840 --> 01:23:38,069
And not you.

1400
01:23:38,280 --> 01:23:40,476
Not even you,
who wrote the bloody thing.

1401
01:23:40,640 --> 01:23:41,960
No.

1402
01:23:42,360 --> 01:23:44,670
Crazy,
cross-dressing Freddie.

1403
01:23:44,840 --> 01:23:46,399
Freddie the freak.
Freddie the fag.

1404
01:23:49,760 --> 01:23:51,991
I'm tired of touring.
Aren't you?

1405
01:23:52,320 --> 01:23:54,118
Album, tour, album, tour.

1406
01:23:54,880 --> 01:23:56,234
I want to do
something different.

1407
01:23:56,400 --> 01:23:58,232
We're a band.
That's what bands do.

1408
01:23:58,400 --> 01:23:59,720
Album, tour, album, tour.

1409
01:23:59,880 --> 01:24:00,950
Well, I need a break.

1410
01:24:01,880 --> 01:24:02,880
I'm sick of it.

1411
01:24:03,440 --> 01:24:04,715
What are you saying,
Freddie?

1412
01:24:23,480 --> 01:24:26,200
I've signed a deal
with CBS Records.

1413
01:24:27,360 --> 01:24:29,136
- You've done what?
- Without telling us?

1414
01:24:29,160 --> 01:24:30,160
What kind of deal?

1415
01:24:30,240 --> 01:24:33,074
Look, I'm not saying we won't
record or ever tour again.

1416
01:24:33,760 --> 01:24:34,955
Queen will go on.

1417
01:24:35,120 --> 01:24:36,713
But I need to do
something different.

1418
01:24:36,920 --> 01:24:40,277
Do you know what I mean?
I need to grow.

1419
01:24:40,440 --> 01:24:42,909
What's the song?
"Fly away"?

1420
01:24:43,640 --> 01:24:46,200
"Spread my wings
and fly away."

1421
01:24:47,080 --> 01:24:48,309
A solo album?

1422
01:24:48,560 --> 01:24:49,630
Two, actually.

1423
01:24:49,800 --> 01:24:51,136
- Back to back.
- Another word out of you...

1424
01:24:51,160 --> 01:24:52,736
and I'll throw you out
the bloody window.

1425
01:24:52,760 --> 01:24:54,638
But that's years, Freddie.
I mean...

1426
01:24:54,800 --> 01:24:56,632
- that'll take years.
- Ye of little faith.

1427
01:24:56,800 --> 01:24:58,280
I don't believe this.

1428
01:24:58,600 --> 01:24:59,600
How much?

1429
01:25:04,240 --> 01:25:05,833
What did they pay you?

1430
01:25:08,360 --> 01:25:09,840
I wanna know how much
they paid you...

1431
01:25:09,920 --> 01:25:11,115
$4 million!

1432
01:25:15,440 --> 01:25:16,954
That's more than
any Queen deal.

1433
01:25:17,120 --> 01:25:18,839
Look, the routine
is killing us.

1434
01:25:19,000 --> 01:25:21,879
I mean, you must all want
a break from all the arguments.

1435
01:25:22,040 --> 01:25:23,679
I mean, whose song
gets on the album...

1436
01:25:23,840 --> 01:25:25,069
whose song's the single...

1437
01:25:25,240 --> 01:25:26,276
who wrote what...

1438
01:25:26,440 --> 01:25:28,096
who gets a bigger slice
of the royalties...

1439
01:25:28,120 --> 01:25:29,554
what's on the B-side,
all of it.

1440
01:25:29,640 --> 01:25:30,640
You must need a break.

1441
01:25:31,120 --> 01:25:32,474
Freddie, we're a family.

1442
01:25:32,640 --> 01:25:33,915
No, we're not!

1443
01:25:34,200 --> 01:25:35,429
We're not a family!

1444
01:25:35,600 --> 01:25:37,751
You've got families,
children, wives.

1445
01:25:37,920 --> 01:25:38,956
What have I got?

1446
01:25:39,120 --> 01:25:41,635
You've got $4 million.
Perhaps you can buy yourself a family.

1447
01:25:45,200 --> 01:25:47,556
I won't compromise
my vision any longer.

1448
01:25:47,640 --> 01:25:49,359
Compromise?

1449
01:25:49,640 --> 01:25:50,869
Are you joking?

1450
01:25:51,080 --> 01:25:53,834
You were working at Heathrow
before we gave you a chance.

1451
01:25:55,800 --> 01:25:57,598
And without me...

1452
01:25:58,280 --> 01:26:00,351
you'd be a dentist...

1453
01:26:00,520 --> 01:26:03,115
drumming 12/8-time blues
at the weekend

1454
01:26:03,200 --> 01:26:04,316
at the Crown and Anchor.

1455
01:26:04,480 --> 01:26:05,550
And you.

1456
01:26:05,920 --> 01:26:08,594
Well, you would be
Dr. Brian May...

1457
01:26:08,760 --> 01:26:11,753
author of a fascinating
dissertation on the cosmos...

1458
01:26:12,280 --> 01:26:13,600
that no one ever reads.

1459
01:26:14,560 --> 01:26:15,835
And Deacy...

1460
01:26:16,280 --> 01:26:18,033
for the life of me...

1461
01:26:19,080 --> 01:26:20,878
nothing comes to mind.

1462
01:26:22,400 --> 01:26:24,073
I studied
electrical engineering.

1463
01:26:24,280 --> 01:26:25,634
Does that meet
your standard?

1464
01:26:26,560 --> 01:26:27,914
Perfect.

1465
01:26:35,960 --> 01:26:37,633
You just killed Queen.

1466
01:26:37,800 --> 01:26:40,440
Oh, give it a kiss one day.
She might wake up.

1467
01:26:40,880 --> 01:26:42,109
You need us, Freddie.

1468
01:26:43,280 --> 01:26:44,280
More than you know.

1469
01:26:44,440 --> 01:26:45,715
I don't need anyone.

1470
01:27:09,880 --> 01:27:11,030
Hello?

1471
01:27:11,960 --> 01:27:13,758
Paul.
Can I speak to Freddie?

1472
01:27:13,920 --> 01:27:16,310
Oh, Mary.
No, he can't talk right now.

1473
01:27:16,480 --> 01:27:18,392
He's working day and night,
constantly.

1474
01:27:18,560 --> 01:27:20,176
Will you make sure
to tell him that I called?

1475
01:27:20,200 --> 01:27:22,635
Don't worry,
he's in safe hands.

1476
01:27:22,840 --> 01:27:24,513
I will certainly
tell him you called.

1477
01:27:25,880 --> 01:27:26,996
Cheers.

1478
01:27:42,640 --> 01:27:44,632
Freddie, it's really great.

1479
01:27:44,800 --> 01:27:45,870
It's shit!

1480
01:27:48,280 --> 01:27:49,280
Just leave it.

1481
01:27:49,360 --> 01:27:50,416
Yeah,
hang on one second.

1482
01:27:51,760 --> 01:27:53,160
Give it more treble.

1483
01:27:57,320 --> 01:27:59,376
Where is he? Is he
there? I wanna speak to him.

1484
01:27:59,400 --> 01:28:01,357
He is working himself
to the bone.

1485
01:28:01,520 --> 01:28:03,680
I'm blue in the face trying
to get him to take a break.

1486
01:28:03,840 --> 01:28:04,880
Paul, listen to me.

1487
01:28:04,960 --> 01:28:06,838
It's one performance
for a good cause.

1488
01:28:07,000 --> 01:28:09,040
It's a televised concert
for the famine in Ethiopia.

1489
01:28:09,560 --> 01:28:11,216
They're gonna have
simultaneous performances

1490
01:28:11,240 --> 01:28:12,469
in Philadelphia and London.

1491
01:28:12,680 --> 01:28:14,478
There's gonna be
a billion people watching.

1492
01:28:14,680 --> 01:28:15,830
Queen should be part of it.

1493
01:28:16,000 --> 01:28:17,176
He's just been
really focused.

1494
01:28:17,200 --> 01:28:18,400
But I'll be sure
to pass it on.

1495
01:28:19,760 --> 01:28:21,319
Sure you will.

1496
01:29:25,480 --> 01:29:26,480
Hi.

1497
01:29:26,560 --> 01:29:28,870
Hi.
Come in, come in.

1498
01:29:30,800 --> 01:29:32,200
Why did you
come all this way?

1499
01:29:32,920 --> 01:29:34,520
I just haven't heard
from you in so long,

1500
01:29:34,600 --> 01:29:36,478
and I phoned and phoned,
and then...

1501
01:29:36,680 --> 01:29:38,216
last night I just had
this terrible dream

1502
01:29:38,240 --> 01:29:39,799
that something bad
had happened.

1503
01:29:40,600 --> 01:29:43,035
No, no.
I've been working, that's all.

1504
01:29:43,200 --> 01:29:46,238
Freddie, you're burning
the candle at both ends.

1505
01:29:46,440 --> 01:29:48,033
Yes, but the glow
is so divine.

1506
01:29:52,560 --> 01:29:53,994
Being human
is a condition

1507
01:29:54,080 --> 01:29:56,675
that requires
a little anesthesia.

1508
01:29:58,120 --> 01:29:59,918
- I miss you.
- I miss you.

1509
01:30:00,120 --> 01:30:01,873
I miss you so much.

1510
01:30:02,240 --> 01:30:04,471
Listen, but I have to finish
the second album.

1511
01:30:05,480 --> 01:30:06,480
I need you.

1512
01:30:07,280 --> 01:30:09,431
Stay. Stay here with me.

1513
01:30:09,600 --> 01:30:11,239
Just you and me.

1514
01:30:12,480 --> 01:30:13,880
I need the love of my life.

1515
01:30:18,360 --> 01:30:19,360
Freddie...

1516
01:30:20,040 --> 01:30:21,520
What about Queen?

1517
01:30:21,680 --> 01:30:22,909
Jim told me
he's been trying

1518
01:30:23,000 --> 01:30:24,275
to contact you
about Live Aid...

1519
01:30:24,480 --> 01:30:26,278
and you won't
take his calls.

1520
01:30:27,680 --> 01:30:28,830
What is Live Aid?

1521
01:30:30,480 --> 01:30:31,516
You haven't heard?

1522
01:30:32,560 --> 01:30:33,840
Freddie,
it's the biggest concert

1523
01:30:33,880 --> 01:30:35,997
there's ever been
or ever will be.

1524
01:30:36,200 --> 01:30:37,839
It's for the famine
in Africa.

1525
01:30:38,000 --> 01:30:40,151
Well, perhaps Paul thought
it wasn't a good idea.

1526
01:30:40,320 --> 01:30:41,595
A distraction from my work.

1527
01:30:41,760 --> 01:30:43,720
That's what's important,
that I finish this album.

1528
01:30:44,240 --> 01:30:46,436
Stay with me, darling,
and I'll be all right.

1529
01:30:46,600 --> 01:30:47,800
Freddie,
I can't stay with you.

1530
01:30:47,960 --> 01:30:50,111
Of course you can.
I need you, Mary.

1531
01:30:50,280 --> 01:30:52,078
Freddie, I'm pregnant.

1532
01:31:05,400 --> 01:31:06,834
How could you?

1533
01:31:08,200 --> 01:31:09,919
How could I?

1534
01:31:11,360 --> 01:31:13,272
Freddie, this has nothing
to do with you.

1535
01:31:13,440 --> 01:31:14,560
Come on. Let's get in.

1536
01:31:14,600 --> 01:31:16,120
I bought some nibbles.

1537
01:31:16,160 --> 01:31:17,276
Freddie.

1538
01:31:17,440 --> 01:31:19,033
Sorry we're late.

1539
01:31:19,800 --> 01:31:20,800
Mary.

1540
01:31:22,120 --> 01:31:24,032
What a pleasant surprise.

1541
01:31:25,760 --> 01:31:28,275
Hans. Everyone, come in.

1542
01:31:28,440 --> 01:31:29,954
Milan,
make our guests comfortable.

1543
01:31:33,320 --> 01:31:35,915
I wish I knew
you were coming to stay.

1544
01:31:36,240 --> 01:31:37,833
I'd have scrubbed the place.

1545
01:31:38,000 --> 01:31:39,434
Actually, I'm not staying.

1546
01:31:39,880 --> 01:31:42,190
Wait. Mary, wait. Don't go.

1547
01:31:44,640 --> 01:31:46,597
You told me
you had a dream.

1548
01:31:47,840 --> 01:31:49,160
What was it?

1549
01:31:50,440 --> 01:31:53,194
I was trying
to talk to you, but...

1550
01:31:54,160 --> 01:31:56,391
it was like
talking to my father.

1551
01:31:56,560 --> 01:31:58,836
You needed
to tell me something...

1552
01:32:00,040 --> 01:32:01,679
but you couldn't say it.

1553
01:32:03,360 --> 01:32:05,875
Because you had no voice.

1554
01:32:09,720 --> 01:32:12,235
Freddie, come and
say hello to our new guests.

1555
01:32:12,960 --> 01:32:15,156
They're dying to meet you.

1556
01:32:15,240 --> 01:32:17,391
He'll be one second.

1557
01:32:19,000 --> 01:32:20,000
Mary!

1558
01:32:31,040 --> 01:32:33,236
I'm happy for you, Mary.

1559
01:32:34,840 --> 01:32:36,399
Truly, I am.

1560
01:32:41,240 --> 01:32:42,469
It's just...

1561
01:32:44,800 --> 01:32:46,314
I'm frightened.

1562
01:32:46,480 --> 01:32:48,472
Freddie,
you don't need to be.

1563
01:32:49,320 --> 01:32:52,040
Because no matter what,
you are loved.

1564
01:32:52,560 --> 01:32:55,155
By me, by Brian,
Deacy, Roger...

1565
01:32:55,320 --> 01:32:56,800
your family.

1566
01:32:58,600 --> 01:33:00,398
It's enough.

1567
01:33:01,520 --> 01:33:03,318
And these people...

1568
01:33:04,000 --> 01:33:06,356
they don't care about you.

1569
01:33:07,040 --> 01:33:09,350
Paul doesn't care about you.

1570
01:33:10,760 --> 01:33:13,229
You don't belong here,
Freddie.

1571
01:33:15,160 --> 01:33:16,640
Come home.

1572
01:33:21,120 --> 01:33:22,679
Home.

1573
01:33:46,120 --> 01:33:47,474
Freddie!

1574
01:33:51,240 --> 01:33:53,630
What are you doing?
You'll catch your death.

1575
01:33:54,760 --> 01:33:57,514
Why didn't you tell me
about Live Aid?

1576
01:33:59,440 --> 01:34:01,591
The Africa charity gig?

1577
01:34:02,600 --> 01:34:04,398
It'll be an embarrassment.

1578
01:34:04,560 --> 01:34:05,994
I didn't wanna
waste your time.

1579
01:34:10,160 --> 01:34:11,753
You should have told me.

1580
01:34:11,920 --> 01:34:13,274
Of course I did.

1581
01:34:14,080 --> 01:34:15,230
You forgot.

1582
01:34:15,400 --> 01:34:17,198
You're always
forgetting things.

1583
01:34:17,960 --> 01:34:19,599
Come in now
and have a drink.

1584
01:34:24,040 --> 01:34:25,190
You're out.

1585
01:34:26,080 --> 01:34:27,080
What do you mean?

1586
01:34:28,960 --> 01:34:31,350
I want you out of my life.

1587
01:34:34,800 --> 01:34:35,995
'Cause I'm the only one left,

1588
01:34:36,080 --> 01:34:37,360
you're blaming me
for everything?

1589
01:34:38,480 --> 01:34:40,312
I blame myself.

1590
01:34:41,800 --> 01:34:43,075
So I'm out?

1591
01:34:43,840 --> 01:34:45,194
Just like that?

1592
01:34:46,480 --> 01:34:48,676
After everything
we've been through?

1593
01:34:50,640 --> 01:34:52,836
Just think of
the photos I have.

1594
01:34:54,040 --> 01:34:56,680
I know who you are,
Freddie Mercury.

1595
01:35:00,040 --> 01:35:02,919
You know when
you know you've gone rotten?

1596
01:35:05,320 --> 01:35:06,720
Really rotten?

1597
01:35:09,040 --> 01:35:10,360
Fruit flies.

1598
01:35:11,520 --> 01:35:14,752
Dirty little fruit flies.

1599
01:35:15,400 --> 01:35:18,074
Coming to feast
on what's left.

1600
01:35:18,240 --> 01:35:21,551
Well, there isn't much left
for you to feast on anymore.

1601
01:35:23,960 --> 01:35:24,996
So, fly off.

1602
01:35:25,440 --> 01:35:29,400
Do what you like with your
photographs and your stories.

1603
01:35:29,560 --> 01:35:32,234
But promise me one thing.

1604
01:35:33,520 --> 01:35:35,591
That I never see
your face again.

1605
01:35:36,880 --> 01:35:38,109
Ever.

1606
01:35:39,440 --> 01:35:40,440
I didn't mean it.

1607
01:35:43,040 --> 01:35:45,032
I'm sorry!
Freddie, come back!

1608
01:35:46,160 --> 01:35:47,799
I'll make it better.

1609
01:36:03,360 --> 01:36:04,696
But, Peter,
you might be right.

1610
01:36:04,720 --> 01:36:05,720
I'm not even hurt

1611
01:36:05,800 --> 01:36:07,416
by the fact that
he's let me go as a friend.

1612
01:36:07,440 --> 01:36:09,875
But you can only be there
so much for a person.

1613
01:36:10,040 --> 01:36:11,474
And so, Mr. Prenter...

1614
01:36:11,640 --> 01:36:12,640
all these stories

1615
01:36:12,720 --> 01:36:15,360
about Freddie Mercury
and his lovers...

1616
01:36:15,520 --> 01:36:17,079
that there were so many.

1617
01:36:17,720 --> 01:36:18,756
Yeah?

1618
01:36:18,960 --> 01:36:20,952
- Is it really true?
- Yes, it is.

1619
01:36:21,120 --> 01:36:22,520
His lovers were countless.

1620
01:36:22,680 --> 01:36:24,319
Genuinely countless. Uh...

1621
01:36:25,440 --> 01:36:28,160
All these wild,
drug-fueled parties...

1622
01:36:29,080 --> 01:36:32,232
where he'd find
another lover every night...

1623
01:36:32,640 --> 01:36:34,757
and a routine
he couldn't get out of.

1624
01:36:34,920 --> 01:36:36,776
So, you really
did see behind the mask?

1625
01:36:36,800 --> 01:36:39,269
I knew Freddie when
he did Bohemian Rhapsody.

1626
01:36:39,480 --> 01:36:41,039
And the Freddie we have now...

1627
01:36:41,760 --> 01:36:43,672
he doesn't have
the same passion about music.

1628
01:36:45,960 --> 01:36:47,076
Hello?

1629
01:36:49,240 --> 01:36:50,240
Hello?

1630
01:36:50,800 --> 01:36:51,800
Miami?

1631
01:36:53,000 --> 01:36:54,000
Freddie?

1632
01:36:54,120 --> 01:36:55,120
How are you?

1633
01:36:55,200 --> 01:36:57,476
There was
this Africa concert...

1634
01:36:57,840 --> 01:36:59,593
that wants Queen to play.

1635
01:36:59,760 --> 01:37:01,194
Is that still...

1636
01:37:01,360 --> 01:37:02,589
You mean Live Aid?

1637
01:37:02,760 --> 01:37:04,638
They've announced
all the bands, Freddie.

1638
01:37:04,800 --> 01:37:06,439
It's too late.

1639
01:37:07,680 --> 01:37:09,114
I need...

1640
01:37:09,280 --> 01:37:11,237
I need to reconnect
with the mothership.

1641
01:37:11,960 --> 01:37:13,917
Freddie, they don't want
anything to do with you.

1642
01:37:14,080 --> 01:37:16,151
They're still very upset.

1643
01:37:17,080 --> 01:37:18,912
Maybe if you ask them...

1644
01:37:19,080 --> 01:37:20,355
they would meet me.

1645
01:37:20,560 --> 01:37:22,438
Tell them I want to talk.

1646
01:37:23,200 --> 01:37:24,714
Just talk.

1647
01:37:28,720 --> 01:37:30,359
We're family.

1648
01:37:33,520 --> 01:37:34,874
You know, family...

1649
01:37:36,120 --> 01:37:37,679
have fights...

1650
01:37:39,640 --> 01:37:41,199
all the time.

1651
01:37:41,800 --> 01:37:43,234
I can call.

1652
01:37:43,920 --> 01:37:45,195
Thank you...

1653
01:37:47,160 --> 01:37:48,160
Jim.

1654
01:37:48,320 --> 01:37:50,073
As this friend,
somebody who...

1655
01:37:50,240 --> 01:37:52,521
probably knows Freddie Mercury
better than anybody else...

1656
01:37:53,080 --> 01:37:56,437
how would you describe him
inside as a person?

1657
01:37:57,720 --> 01:37:59,074
For me,
Freddie will always be...

1658
01:37:59,680 --> 01:38:02,036
this frightened
little Pakkie boy...

1659
01:38:02,200 --> 01:38:03,953
who's afraid to be alone.

1660
01:38:04,240 --> 01:38:05,594
I hope he sees this

1661
01:38:05,680 --> 01:38:07,478
and realizes
what he has lost in you.

1662
01:38:07,640 --> 01:38:09,040
I hope he does, too.

1663
01:38:09,200 --> 01:38:11,476
A close and important friend.

1664
01:38:27,480 --> 01:38:28,914
Where are they?

1665
01:38:29,640 --> 01:38:30,994
They're late.

1666
01:38:38,720 --> 01:38:39,720
Hi, guys.

1667
01:38:39,880 --> 01:38:40,996
Jim.

1668
01:38:43,120 --> 01:38:44,839
If anybody wants
any tea, coffee...

1669
01:38:45,000 --> 01:38:46,229
bladed weapons...

1670
01:38:47,680 --> 01:38:48,955
just ask.

1671
01:38:50,840 --> 01:38:51,840
So...

1672
01:38:53,400 --> 01:38:54,400
who wants to go first?

1673
01:38:54,560 --> 01:38:55,755
I'll start.

1674
01:38:57,640 --> 01:38:59,154
I've been hideous.

1675
01:38:59,320 --> 01:39:00,959
I know that, and...

1676
01:39:01,480 --> 01:39:02,755
I deserve your fury.

1677
01:39:03,880 --> 01:39:05,109
I've been conceited...

1678
01:39:06,760 --> 01:39:08,240
selfish.

1679
01:39:11,840 --> 01:39:13,593
Well, an asshole, basically.

1680
01:39:13,800 --> 01:39:14,995
Strong beginning.

1681
01:39:16,640 --> 01:39:18,472
Look, I'm happy to
strip off my shirt...

1682
01:39:18,680 --> 01:39:20,797
and flagellate myself
before you.

1683
01:39:23,800 --> 01:39:25,917
Or rather, I could ask you
a simple question.

1684
01:39:26,080 --> 01:39:27,280
I'm good
with the flagellation.

1685
01:39:32,240 --> 01:39:34,596
What's it gonna take
for you all to forgive me?

1686
01:39:34,960 --> 01:39:36,838
Is that what you want,
Freddie?

1687
01:39:38,280 --> 01:39:39,316
I forgive you.

1688
01:39:39,400 --> 01:39:41,000
- Is that it? Can we go now?
- No.

1689
01:39:47,240 --> 01:39:48,674
I went to Munich.

1690
01:39:48,840 --> 01:39:50,559
I hired a bunch of guys.

1691
01:39:50,720 --> 01:39:52,632
I told them exactly
what I wanted them to do...

1692
01:39:52,840 --> 01:39:54,115
and the problem was...

1693
01:39:57,160 --> 01:39:58,196
they did it.

1694
01:40:00,160 --> 01:40:02,356
No pushback from Roger.

1695
01:40:04,000 --> 01:40:05,593
None of your rewrites.

1696
01:40:06,440 --> 01:40:08,033
None of his funny looks.

1697
01:40:12,720 --> 01:40:14,074
I need you.

1698
01:40:17,840 --> 01:40:19,354
And you need me.

1699
01:40:23,800 --> 01:40:24,995
Let's face it.

1700
01:40:25,120 --> 01:40:26,759
We're not bad
for four aging queens.

1701
01:40:29,320 --> 01:40:30,834
So, um, go ahead.

1702
01:40:31,360 --> 01:40:33,079
Name your terms.

1703
01:40:34,880 --> 01:40:36,951
Could you give us a moment,
please, Fred?

1704
01:40:53,480 --> 01:40:54,755
Why'd you do that?

1705
01:40:54,920 --> 01:40:56,912
I just felt like it.

1706
01:41:09,160 --> 01:41:11,595
They'll be all right.
They just need a bit of time.

1707
01:41:13,600 --> 01:41:15,398
What if I don't have time?

1708
01:41:17,960 --> 01:41:19,679
What do you mean, Fred?

1709
01:41:25,720 --> 01:41:27,677
You can come back in now,
if you'd like.

1710
01:41:33,840 --> 01:41:34,840
We decided...

1711
01:41:36,360 --> 01:41:37,360
What did we decide?

1712
01:41:38,000 --> 01:41:39,036
From now on...

1713
01:41:39,200 --> 01:41:42,511
every song, no matter
who wrote it, music, lyrics...

1714
01:41:42,880 --> 01:41:44,155
it's by Queen.

1715
01:41:44,520 --> 01:41:46,716
Not one of us,
just Queen.

1716
01:41:46,880 --> 01:41:48,678
All the money,
all the credits,

1717
01:41:48,760 --> 01:41:50,558
split four ways evenly.

1718
01:41:50,640 --> 01:41:51,710
Done.

1719
01:41:52,200 --> 01:41:54,032
We have a problem
with the people around you.

1720
01:41:54,200 --> 01:41:55,520
Paul is out.
I fired him.

1721
01:41:55,680 --> 01:41:57,672
- On what pretext?
- Villainy.

1722
01:41:57,880 --> 01:41:59,155
What else?

1723
01:41:59,240 --> 01:42:00,276
Bob Geldof.

1724
01:42:00,440 --> 01:42:02,432
I called to convince him
to squeeze you guys

1725
01:42:02,520 --> 01:42:04,273
into the lineup
for the Live Aid concert...

1726
01:42:04,440 --> 01:42:06,113
but he wants an answer now.

1727
01:42:06,400 --> 01:42:08,278
You have to make a decision.

1728
01:42:09,840 --> 01:42:11,354
Every ticket's already sold.

1729
01:42:11,560 --> 01:42:13,233
100,000 people at Wembley...

1730
01:42:13,400 --> 01:42:16,552
100,000 people at
JFK Stadium in Philadelphia...

1731
01:42:16,720 --> 01:42:20,077
a global TV audience around
the world of 150 countries...

1732
01:42:20,240 --> 01:42:21,640
13 satellites.

1733
01:42:22,040 --> 01:42:24,316
The Olympics only had three.

1734
01:42:25,240 --> 01:42:27,072
We haven't
played together in years.

1735
01:42:27,280 --> 01:42:28,714
It's kinda suicide
to play again...

1736
01:42:28,880 --> 01:42:30,553
for the first time
in front of millions.

1737
01:42:30,720 --> 01:42:33,474
Try over 1.5 billion.

1738
01:42:34,600 --> 01:42:36,910
"Who are
these four dinosaurs?"

1739
01:42:37,320 --> 01:42:38,754
"Where's Madonna?"

1740
01:42:38,960 --> 01:42:41,191
It's a 20-minute set.
Everyone gets the same.

1741
01:42:41,840 --> 01:42:43,832
Jagger, Bowie...

1742
01:42:44,640 --> 01:42:45,790
Elton...

1743
01:42:46,240 --> 01:42:48,880
McCartney, The Who...

1744
01:42:49,040 --> 01:42:50,554
Led Zeppelin...

1745
01:42:50,720 --> 01:42:53,315
Phil Collins,
REO Speedwagon...

1746
01:42:54,240 --> 01:42:55,640
Bob Dylan.

1747
01:42:55,800 --> 01:42:56,916
Certainly good company.

1748
01:42:57,080 --> 01:42:59,056
Anybody who is anybody
is doing this concert.

1749
01:42:59,080 --> 01:43:00,355
Look.

1750
01:43:00,440 --> 01:43:01,635
All I know...

1751
01:43:02,040 --> 01:43:05,716
is that if we wake up
the day after this concert...

1752
01:43:06,480 --> 01:43:08,631
and we didn't do our part...

1753
01:43:10,200 --> 01:43:12,874
we're going to regret it
till the day we die.

1754
01:43:20,000 --> 01:43:21,275
Please.

1755
01:43:28,560 --> 01:43:30,199
Every day, in San Francisco,

1756
01:43:30,280 --> 01:43:32,158
two more men
hear the grim news...

1757
01:43:32,320 --> 01:43:33,993
"You have AIDS,
there's no cure."

1758
01:43:34,160 --> 01:43:35,913
Since doctors
in France and America

1759
01:43:36,000 --> 01:43:37,912
isolated the virus in 1983...

1760
01:43:38,080 --> 01:43:40,549
research has proceeded
at a frantic pace.

1761
01:43:40,720 --> 01:43:42,234
The method used by the virus

1762
01:43:42,360 --> 01:43:44,079
to destroy
the body's immune system...

1763
01:43:44,280 --> 01:43:45,555
has been discovered...

1764
01:43:45,720 --> 01:43:48,360
but a cure still seems
many years away.

1765
01:43:48,920 --> 01:43:51,196
A major breakthrough
has been a new blood test...

1766
01:43:51,360 --> 01:43:52,794
that should ensure
that in future...

1767
01:43:52,960 --> 01:43:55,714
nobody contracts AIDS
from a blood transfusion.

1768
01:43:55,880 --> 01:43:57,872
But it's onlyjust
been approved for use.

1769
01:43:58,080 --> 01:44:03,633
What is this thing
that builds our dreams

1770
01:44:03,840 --> 01:44:09,598
Yet slips away from us?

1771
01:44:11,440 --> 01:44:17,391
Who wants to live forever?

1772
01:44:17,960 --> 01:44:24,309
Who wants to live forever?

1773
01:44:31,360 --> 01:44:35,320
There's no chance for us

1774
01:44:37,360 --> 01:44:42,037
It's all decided for us

1775
01:44:44,000 --> 01:44:48,791
This world has only one

1776
01:44:48,960 --> 01:44:54,433
Sweet moment
set aside for us

1777
01:44:58,040 --> 01:44:59,554
Do you understand?

1778
01:45:01,120 --> 01:45:06,320
The way we go from here is
that treatments are available.

1779
01:45:06,480 --> 01:45:09,120
They're not particularly
effective, Freddie.

1780
01:45:35,240 --> 01:45:36,833
Eh-oh!

1781
01:45:45,840 --> 01:45:47,479
Eh-oh.

1782
01:46:21,800 --> 01:46:22,800
Yep.

1783
01:46:23,400 --> 01:46:24,436
Mmm-hmm.

1784
01:46:24,800 --> 01:46:26,200
- Let's call it. Yeah?
- Yeah, yeah.

1785
01:46:27,120 --> 01:46:28,156
Sorry.

1786
01:46:29,040 --> 01:46:30,040
I sound like shit.

1787
01:46:31,680 --> 01:46:34,036
You all are lovely,
you sound good.

1788
01:46:34,840 --> 01:46:35,840
Been a while.

1789
01:46:36,560 --> 01:46:38,597
My throat feels like
a vulture's crotch.

1790
01:46:38,680 --> 01:46:40,558
We still got a week.

1791
01:46:40,720 --> 01:46:41,720
We'll get there.

1792
01:46:41,880 --> 01:46:43,633
Yeah, we're in
a good place, Fred.

1793
01:46:43,800 --> 01:46:45,632
You just need a bit of rest,
that's all.

1794
01:46:46,840 --> 01:46:47,876
Yeah.

1795
01:46:48,520 --> 01:46:49,636
Get a drink, Rog?

1796
01:46:49,720 --> 01:46:50,936
Yeah,
there's a nice little pub

1797
01:46:50,960 --> 01:46:52,758
- down the road, actually.
- Can I come?

1798
01:46:52,840 --> 01:46:53,896
We're just an exclusive...

1799
01:46:53,920 --> 01:46:55,639
No, of course not.
Invite-only.

1800
01:46:55,760 --> 01:46:56,816
Yeah,
that's kind of you.

1801
01:46:56,840 --> 01:46:58,274
Before you leave...

1802
01:47:00,600 --> 01:47:02,114
Could I have a second?

1803
01:47:02,680 --> 01:47:04,478
Yeah. What's up?

1804
01:47:07,520 --> 01:47:08,920
I've got it.

1805
01:47:10,800 --> 01:47:12,075
Got what?

1806
01:47:13,000 --> 01:47:14,229
AIDS.

1807
01:47:16,320 --> 01:47:18,516
I wanted you to
hear it from me.

1808
01:47:20,040 --> 01:47:21,713
Fred, I'm so sorry.

1809
01:47:21,880 --> 01:47:23,200
Brian, stop.

1810
01:47:23,360 --> 01:47:24,555
Don't.

1811
01:47:27,240 --> 01:47:28,993
For right now...

1812
01:47:29,440 --> 01:47:30,440
it's between us.

1813
01:47:30,600 --> 01:47:32,512
All right? Just us.

1814
01:47:33,320 --> 01:47:34,879
So, please...

1815
01:47:35,840 --> 01:47:37,194
if any of you...

1816
01:47:37,960 --> 01:47:41,636
fuss about it or frown
about it, or, worst of all...

1817
01:47:41,800 --> 01:47:43,951
if you bore me
with your sympathy...

1818
01:47:44,120 --> 01:47:46,032
that's just seconds wasted.

1819
01:47:46,200 --> 01:47:48,840
Seconds that could be used
making music...

1820
01:47:49,000 --> 01:47:51,674
which is all I want to do
with the time I have left.

1821
01:47:51,840 --> 01:47:54,435
I don't have time
to be their victim...

1822
01:47:54,920 --> 01:47:58,072
their AIDS poster boy,
their cautionary tale.

1823
01:47:58,280 --> 01:48:01,000
No, I decide who I am.

1824
01:48:02,400 --> 01:48:05,234
I'm going to be
what I was born to be.

1825
01:48:06,600 --> 01:48:07,954
A performer...

1826
01:48:08,840 --> 01:48:11,400
who gives the people
what they want.

1827
01:48:15,880 --> 01:48:18,190
Touch of the heavens.

1828
01:48:21,320 --> 01:48:23,471
Freddie fucking Mercury.

1829
01:48:25,840 --> 01:48:27,752
You're a legend, Fred.

1830
01:48:30,680 --> 01:48:32,717
You're bloody right I am.

1831
01:48:33,200 --> 01:48:34,873
We're all legends.

1832
01:48:35,720 --> 01:48:37,552
But you're right,
I am a legend.

1833
01:48:37,640 --> 01:48:39,359
Now, you give me a chance

1834
01:48:39,440 --> 01:48:41,796
to get my bitchy little
vocal cords in order...

1835
01:48:43,520 --> 01:48:44,874
and we'll go and punch a hole

1836
01:48:44,960 --> 01:48:46,792
through the roof
of that stadium.

1837
01:48:48,560 --> 01:48:50,438
Actually, Wembley
doesn't have a roof.

1838
01:48:52,080 --> 01:48:54,356
- All right.
- No, he's right. It doesn't.

1839
01:48:54,760 --> 01:48:57,150
Then we'll punch a hole
in the sky.

1840
01:49:02,720 --> 01:49:04,896
Now, even though you're crying
like three little girls...

1841
01:49:04,920 --> 01:49:05,920
I still love you.

1842
01:49:06,120 --> 01:49:07,336
- All right, enough of this.
- All right.

1843
01:49:07,360 --> 01:49:08,430
- Drink?
- Yes!

1844
01:49:08,640 --> 01:49:09,640
Or ten?

1845
01:49:26,200 --> 01:49:27,554
What are you looking at?

1846
01:49:29,040 --> 01:49:30,520
You think
you could do better?

1847
01:49:32,520 --> 01:49:33,520
Everyone's a critic.

1848
01:49:33,680 --> 01:49:35,433
It's 12:00 noon in London.

1849
01:49:35,520 --> 01:49:37,216
7:00 a.m. in Philadelphia.

1850
01:49:37,240 --> 01:49:39,914
And around the world,
it's time for Live Aid.

1851
01:49:40,080 --> 01:49:41,216
If you have
credit cards...

1852
01:49:41,240 --> 01:49:42,656
you can phone up with
the number you want to give.

1853
01:49:42,680 --> 01:49:44,800
But you can also pledge cash,
and it's very important.

1854
01:49:45,320 --> 01:49:46,834
There is not enough money
coming in...

1855
01:49:47,000 --> 01:49:48,434
and all these people
are not playing

1856
01:49:48,560 --> 01:49:49,616
for the good of their health.

1857
01:49:49,640 --> 01:49:51,760
They're playing for the good
of other people's health.

1858
01:49:51,840 --> 01:49:53,433
So get your money out now!

1859
01:49:53,600 --> 01:49:55,432
And phone up
and give us the money.

1860
01:49:55,600 --> 01:49:57,671
You've got plenty of it,
or if you got none of it...

1861
01:49:57,840 --> 01:49:59,911
get it to people
who are dying of starvation.

1862
01:50:00,080 --> 01:50:02,754
We want to get a million
pounds out of this country.

1863
01:50:02,920 --> 01:50:05,435
On the telephone,
before 10:00 tonight.

1864
01:50:24,160 --> 01:50:26,072
Do you have any idea...

1865
01:50:26,240 --> 01:50:28,960
how many Jim Huttons
there are in London?

1866
01:50:29,400 --> 01:50:31,551
Well, I didn't want to
make it too easy for you.

1867
01:50:33,560 --> 01:50:35,199
How have you been, Freddie?

1868
01:50:36,240 --> 01:50:38,277
I've been a bit lost,
to be honest.

1869
01:50:39,040 --> 01:50:40,394
You were right.

1870
01:50:40,680 --> 01:50:42,273
I could do with a friend.

1871
01:50:43,480 --> 01:50:45,233
Would you like
to have tea with me?

1872
01:50:45,320 --> 01:50:46,320
Tea?

1873
01:51:00,160 --> 01:51:02,152
So, Jim,
how do you know Freddie?

1874
01:51:02,320 --> 01:51:04,835
Do you work together?

1875
01:51:15,960 --> 01:51:17,440
Jim's my friend.

1876
01:51:23,320 --> 01:51:24,913
Wonderful to have friends.

1877
01:51:25,080 --> 01:51:27,595
Mithai.
Jer made it herself.

1878
01:51:30,480 --> 01:51:31,550
Thank you.

1879
01:51:31,720 --> 01:51:33,536
- Freddie?
- Your favorite, Freddie.

1880
01:51:33,560 --> 01:51:34,680
We have to go, Mum.

1881
01:51:34,840 --> 01:51:35,960
But you just got here, beta.

1882
01:51:36,120 --> 01:51:37,190
What do you mean, "go"?

1883
01:51:37,360 --> 01:51:38,919
We've gotta get to Wembley.

1884
01:51:39,320 --> 01:51:40,754
Would you believe it?

1885
01:51:40,960 --> 01:51:43,156
Jim's never been
to a rock concert.

1886
01:51:43,240 --> 01:51:44,240
That's true.

1887
01:51:44,320 --> 01:51:45,816
Queen are
playing at Live Aid.

1888
01:51:45,840 --> 01:51:46,896
We're all doing our bit

1889
01:51:46,920 --> 01:51:48,513
for the starving children
in Africa...

1890
01:51:48,720 --> 01:51:50,871
and nobody's
taking any money.

1891
01:51:56,240 --> 01:51:59,870
Good thoughts, good words,
good deeds.

1892
01:52:02,280 --> 01:52:04,158
Just like you
taught me, Papa.

1893
01:52:19,600 --> 01:52:20,600
Love you, beta.

1894
01:52:22,080 --> 01:52:23,878
Bye, Kash.
Love you, too, Mama.

1895
01:52:27,160 --> 01:52:28,435
In fact...

1896
01:52:29,480 --> 01:52:30,709
I'll blow you a kiss

1897
01:52:30,800 --> 01:52:32,314
when I'm on stage.

1898
01:52:39,680 --> 01:52:40,909
Kashi...

1899
01:52:42,200 --> 01:52:43,759
put on the telly.

1900
01:53:04,880 --> 01:53:06,473
- Hello, Mary!
- Hi, Brian!

1901
01:53:06,640 --> 01:53:08,074
We just came
to wish you good luck.

1902
01:53:08,240 --> 01:53:09,469
Hello, my love.

1903
01:53:11,880 --> 01:53:13,075
Hi.

1904
01:53:13,240 --> 01:53:14,276
Mary, David...

1905
01:53:14,440 --> 01:53:15,840
this is Jim.

1906
01:53:16,000 --> 01:53:17,116
Jim...

1907
01:53:17,280 --> 01:53:18,430
Mary and David.

1908
01:53:19,800 --> 01:53:21,234
It's nice to meet you.

1909
01:53:21,880 --> 01:53:23,473
- Hi.
- Hi.

1910
01:53:24,520 --> 01:53:25,520
I'll see you after.

1911
01:53:28,560 --> 01:53:30,016
I don't think
you're gonna be able to see

1912
01:53:30,040 --> 01:53:31,474
anything from here.
Join them.

1913
01:53:44,560 --> 01:53:47,394
What do
we think of David?

1914
01:53:51,040 --> 01:53:52,110
Nice chap.

1915
01:53:54,400 --> 01:53:55,720
I think he's gay.

1916
01:53:57,440 --> 01:53:59,796
We'll be on
in about one minute.

1917
01:54:00,800 --> 01:54:02,917
One, two. One, two.

1918
01:54:03,600 --> 01:54:05,193
That's almost us.

1919
01:54:05,400 --> 01:54:06,400
We ready?

1920
01:54:06,800 --> 01:54:07,950
Feel good?

1921
01:54:08,680 --> 01:54:09,716
So we have had

1922
01:54:09,800 --> 01:54:11,240
a bit of a complaint
about the noise.

1923
01:54:15,520 --> 01:54:17,512
From a woman in Belgium.

1924
01:54:31,120 --> 01:54:32,120
Anyway...

1925
01:54:32,280 --> 01:54:36,240
it gives us enormous pleasure
to introduce the next combo...

1926
01:54:36,400 --> 01:54:37,629
who are...

1927
01:54:37,800 --> 01:54:38,916
Queen!

1928
01:54:42,280 --> 01:54:43,280
Her Majesty...

1929
01:54:44,000 --> 01:54:46,231
- Queen!
- Check, two, check.

1930
01:54:55,440 --> 01:54:56,440
Nothing.

1931
01:56:00,240 --> 01:56:01,833
Mama

1932
01:56:02,960 --> 01:56:05,156
Just killed a man

1933
01:56:06,000 --> 01:56:08,469
Put a gun against his head

1934
01:56:08,640 --> 01:56:12,077
Pulled my trigger,
now he's dead

1935
01:56:12,400 --> 01:56:13,834
Mama

1936
01:56:14,640 --> 01:56:17,030
Life had just begun

1937
01:56:18,600 --> 01:56:23,959
But now I've gone
and thrown it all away

1938
01:56:24,880 --> 01:56:29,079
Mama
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

1939
01:56:30,840 --> 01:56:34,038
Didn't mean to make you cry

1940
01:56:34,200 --> 01:56:38,319
If I'm not back again
this time tomorrow

1941
01:56:38,480 --> 01:56:41,552
Carry on, carry on

1942
01:56:41,760 --> 01:56:45,231
As if nothing really matters

1943
01:56:54,360 --> 01:56:55,760
Too late

1944
01:56:57,040 --> 01:56:58,952
My time has come

1945
01:57:00,120 --> 01:57:02,237
Sends shivers down my spine

1946
01:57:02,920 --> 01:57:06,311
Body's aching all the time

1947
01:57:06,600 --> 01:57:09,069
Goodbye, everybody

1948
01:57:09,600 --> 01:57:12,479
I've got to go

1949
01:57:12,640 --> 01:57:17,396
Gotta leave you all behind
and face the truth

1950
01:57:19,000 --> 01:57:22,914
Mama
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

1951
01:57:25,120 --> 01:57:28,079
I don't want to die

1952
01:57:28,240 --> 01:57:31,950
I sometimes wish
I'd never been born at all

1953
01:58:37,160 --> 01:58:41,040
I'd sit alone
and watch your light

1954
01:58:41,200 --> 01:58:45,240
My only friend
through teenage nights

1955
01:58:45,400 --> 01:58:49,360
And everything
I had to know

1956
01:58:49,520 --> 01:58:53,719
I heard it on my radio

1957
01:58:55,560 --> 01:58:59,554
You gave them all
those old-time stars

1958
01:58:59,720 --> 01:59:03,600
Through wars of worlds
invaded by Mars

1959
01:59:03,760 --> 01:59:07,640
You made 'em laugh,
you made 'em cry

1960
01:59:07,800 --> 01:59:12,591
You made us feel
like we could fly

1961
01:59:13,840 --> 01:59:18,153
So don't become
some background noise

1962
01:59:18,320 --> 01:59:21,996
A backdrop
for the girls and boys

1963
01:59:22,160 --> 01:59:26,074
Who just don't know
orjust don't care

1964
01:59:26,240 --> 01:59:30,393
And just complain
when you're not there

1965
01:59:30,600 --> 01:59:34,276
You had your time,
you had the power

1966
01:59:34,440 --> 01:59:38,832
You've yet to have
your finest hour

1967
01:59:39,000 --> 01:59:40,400
Radio

1968
01:59:41,120 --> 01:59:42,395
Everybody!

1969
01:59:42,880 --> 01:59:44,837
All we hear is

1970
01:59:44,920 --> 01:59:46,798
Radio ga ga

1971
01:59:46,960 --> 01:59:48,519
Radio goo goo

1972
01:59:48,800 --> 01:59:50,678
Radio ga ga

1973
01:59:50,840 --> 01:59:52,718
All we hear is

1974
01:59:52,880 --> 01:59:54,360
Radio ga ga

1975
01:59:54,720 --> 01:59:56,632
Radio goo goo

1976
01:59:56,800 --> 01:59:58,154
Radio ga ga

1977
01:59:58,440 --> 02:00:00,591
All we hear is

1978
02:00:00,760 --> 02:00:02,319
Radio ga ga

1979
02:00:02,760 --> 02:00:04,479
Radio blah blah

1980
02:00:04,640 --> 02:00:07,917
Radio, what's new?

1981
02:00:08,800 --> 02:00:10,632
Radio

1982
02:00:10,800 --> 02:00:15,920
Someone still loves you

1983
02:00:20,480 --> 02:00:23,632
Loves

1984
02:00:26,640 --> 02:00:30,350
You

1985
02:00:46,040 --> 02:00:47,872
Eh-oh!

1986
02:00:47,960 --> 02:00:49,917
Eh-oh!

1987
02:01:22,520 --> 02:01:24,477
- All right!
- All right!

1988
02:01:25,160 --> 02:01:28,073
Hey! Hammer to Fall!

1989
02:01:42,880 --> 02:01:45,952
Here we stand
or here we fall

1990
02:01:46,720 --> 02:01:49,394
History don't care at all

1991
02:01:49,880 --> 02:01:53,237
Make the bed,
light the light

1992
02:01:53,720 --> 02:01:56,633
Lady Mercy
won't be home tonight

1993
02:01:56,800 --> 02:02:00,476
You don't waste
no time at all

1994
02:02:00,640 --> 02:02:03,633
Don't hear the bell
but you answer the call

1995
02:02:03,800 --> 02:02:06,872
It comes to you as to us all

1996
02:02:07,040 --> 02:02:10,158
Yeah! And it's time
for the hammer to fall

1997
02:02:10,920 --> 02:02:13,276
Every night, every day

1998
02:02:14,400 --> 02:02:17,199
A little piece of you
is falling away

1999
02:02:17,480 --> 02:02:21,235
But lift your face
the Western way

2000
02:02:24,440 --> 02:02:28,116
Toe your line
and play their game

2001
02:02:28,480 --> 02:02:31,154
Then it's time
for the hammer to fall

2002
02:02:36,440 --> 02:02:38,557
Rich or poor or famous

2003
02:02:38,720 --> 02:02:40,440
Hello? Live Aid.

2004
02:02:40,960 --> 02:02:41,996
Hello? Live Aid.

2005
02:02:42,160 --> 02:02:44,200
- Hello? Live Aid.
- Hello? This is Live Aid.

2006
02:02:44,280 --> 02:02:45,794
Oh, no

2007
02:02:46,280 --> 02:02:47,316
Lock your door

2008
02:02:47,400 --> 02:02:48,436
Hello, Live Aid.

2009
02:02:48,920 --> 02:02:51,992
- We just hit a million!
- One million pounds!

2010
02:02:52,080 --> 02:02:53,736
One million pounds!

2011
02:02:53,760 --> 02:02:54,760
Thanks. Great.

2012
02:02:57,840 --> 02:03:01,550
For you who grew up
tall and proud

2013
02:03:02,000 --> 02:03:04,560
In the shadow
of the mushroom cloud

2014
02:03:04,720 --> 02:03:08,236
Convinced our voices
can't be heard

2015
02:03:08,600 --> 02:03:11,354
Just wanna scream it louder
And louder and louder

2016
02:03:11,520 --> 02:03:15,230
What the hell
we fighting for?

2017
02:03:15,400 --> 02:03:17,232
And it's time
for the hammer to

2018
02:03:17,320 --> 02:03:18,320
Hammer to fall

2019
02:03:39,240 --> 02:03:40,435
Yeah

2020
02:03:40,640 --> 02:03:41,835
Yeah, yeah

2021
02:03:42,000 --> 02:03:43,434
One more time!

2022
02:03:45,560 --> 02:03:51,477
Waiting for
the hammer to fall

2023
02:03:58,360 --> 02:04:00,397
Give it to me one more time!

2024
02:04:23,360 --> 02:04:26,671
I've paid my dues

2025
02:04:26,840 --> 02:04:28,752
Time after time

2026
02:04:30,520 --> 02:04:32,955
I've done my sentence

2027
02:04:33,680 --> 02:04:36,673
But committed no crime

2028
02:04:37,600 --> 02:04:39,557
And bad mistakes

2029
02:04:40,880 --> 02:04:43,714
I've made a few

2030
02:04:44,640 --> 02:04:48,190
I've had my share of sand
kicked in my face

2031
02:04:48,360 --> 02:04:51,319
But I've come through

2032
02:04:54,640 --> 02:04:59,192
We are the champions,
my friends

2033
02:05:01,480 --> 02:05:06,157
And we'll keep on fighting
till the end

2034
02:05:09,080 --> 02:05:16,112
We are the champions

2035
02:05:16,320 --> 02:05:19,313
No time for losers

2036
02:05:19,480 --> 02:05:24,316
'Cause we are the champions

2037
02:05:24,480 --> 02:05:27,712
Of the world

2038
02:05:30,680 --> 02:05:32,637
I've taken my bows

2039
02:05:33,680 --> 02:05:36,639
And my curtain calls

2040
02:05:37,960 --> 02:05:40,191
You brought me
fame and fortune

2041
02:05:40,280 --> 02:05:41,953
And everything
that goes with it

2042
02:05:42,120 --> 02:05:43,395
I thank you all

2043
02:05:44,880 --> 02:05:47,475
But it's been
no bed of roses

2044
02:05:48,600 --> 02:05:51,513
No pleasure cruise

2045
02:05:51,920 --> 02:05:55,231
I consider it a challenge
Before the whole human race

2046
02:05:55,640 --> 02:05:58,792
And I ain't gonna lose

2047
02:06:02,120 --> 02:06:07,559
We are the champions,
my friends

2048
02:06:09,040 --> 02:06:14,957
And we'll keep on fighting
till the end

2049
02:06:16,320 --> 02:06:23,432
We are the champions

2050
02:06:23,600 --> 02:06:26,991
No time for losers

2051
02:06:27,160 --> 02:06:31,074
'Cause we are the champions

2052
02:06:32,840 --> 02:06:37,869
We are the champions,
my friends

2053
02:06:39,360 --> 02:06:44,230
And we'll keep on fighting
till the end

2054
02:06:46,640 --> 02:06:53,638
We are the champions

2055
02:06:53,800 --> 02:06:57,157
No time for losers

2056
02:06:57,320 --> 02:07:01,837
'Cause we are the champions

2057
02:07:10,640 --> 02:07:15,556
Of the world

2058
02:07:48,760 --> 02:07:50,160
So long and goodbye!

2059
02:07:54,800 --> 02:07:56,234
We love you!
