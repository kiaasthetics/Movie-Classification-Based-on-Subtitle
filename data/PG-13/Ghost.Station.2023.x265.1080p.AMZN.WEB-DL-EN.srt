1
00:01:16,952 --> 00:01:19,246
Got here just in time
for the last train.

2
00:01:19,663 --> 00:01:22,291
It’s so late that
this place is deserted.

3
00:01:30,424 --> 00:01:32,634
What is up with that girl?

4
00:01:33,176 --> 00:01:35,929
This is why you should
know your alcohol limit.

5
00:01:36,471 --> 00:01:38,432
It’s like she’s dancing.

6
00:01:39,349 --> 00:01:40,434
That’s hilarious.

7
00:01:52,988 --> 00:01:54,281
I’ll just take one pic.

8
00:02:02,998 --> 00:02:03,540
Damn.

9
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:04,458
Head butt...

10
00:02:08,295 --> 00:02:10,005
Is that blood?

11
00:02:12,049 --> 00:02:14,217
Is she okay?

12
00:02:30,359 --> 00:02:33,195
Why are they blabbering on
about a ghost?

13
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:36,573
No way.

14
00:02:38,950 --> 00:02:40,327
Where did she go?

15
00:02:59,846 --> 00:03:01,556
What’s that?

16
00:03:03,892 --> 00:03:08,772
Gupabal train is approaching.

17
00:03:52,190 --> 00:03:53,275
You’re saying is,

18
00:03:54,109 --> 00:03:55,569
she’s a man?

19
00:03:55,986 --> 00:03:56,903
I didn’t know.

20
00:03:57,404 --> 00:03:59,656
Who’d mistake her for a man?

21
00:03:59,656 --> 00:04:02,117
Gender of this person
isn’t the issue at hand,

22
00:04:02,117 --> 00:04:05,787
the problem is the fact that
you outed him without consent.

23
00:04:05,787 --> 00:04:09,291
I absolutely got his consent.

24
00:04:09,541 --> 00:04:12,711
Hello, I’m Kim Na-young
from Daily Modu,

25
00:04:12,711 --> 00:04:16,006
could I take some pics
and used them in an article?

26
00:04:16,298 --> 00:04:17,883
You’re perfect for ‘Summer It Girl’.

27
00:04:24,514 --> 00:04:25,724
Thank you!

28
00:04:27,684 --> 00:04:29,603
The victim was drunk at the time,

29
00:04:30,187 --> 00:04:31,980
can you call that a proper consent?

30
00:04:32,439 --> 00:04:35,567
You post fluff card stack articles
on social media,

31
00:04:35,817 --> 00:04:37,277
and fake stories
for some loose change.

32
00:04:38,111 --> 00:04:39,905
What’d kids nowadays learn from that?

33
00:04:39,905 --> 00:04:40,906
What did you say?

34
00:04:40,906 --> 00:04:42,574
Please calm down.

35
00:04:43,116 --> 00:04:45,785
You can apologize and
post a correction as usual,

36
00:04:46,953 --> 00:04:49,206
but what about the settlement?

37
00:04:50,916 --> 00:04:51,791
Settlement?

38
00:04:54,044 --> 00:04:55,128
How much would that be?

39
00:04:59,549 --> 00:05:01,510
- $50,000?
- Yes.

40
00:05:01,885 --> 00:05:03,094
That’s a lot of money, no?

41
00:05:04,429 --> 00:05:05,055
Yes.

42
00:05:05,722 --> 00:05:07,098
Have you met the accuser?

43
00:05:07,849 --> 00:05:09,142
No, not yet.

44
00:05:09,142 --> 00:05:10,101
Why not?

45
00:05:10,727 --> 00:05:12,771
I don’t have his number...

46
00:05:13,438 --> 00:05:16,274
How could a reporter not have
her subject’s number?

47
00:05:17,317 --> 00:05:18,443
I’m sorry.

48
00:05:19,486 --> 00:05:21,071
Is your family loaded?

49
00:05:21,321 --> 00:05:22,030
Pardon?

50
00:05:22,614 --> 00:05:24,366
To settle!

51
00:05:24,991 --> 00:05:27,202
But my editor confirmed
that article.

52
00:05:27,202 --> 00:05:28,245
So?

53
00:05:28,703 --> 00:05:30,413
Why should I pay...

54
00:05:30,747 --> 00:05:32,749
It was an unconsented photo.

55
00:05:35,168 --> 00:05:37,337
I got his consent.

56
00:05:38,046 --> 00:05:41,007
Got proof? A recording
or a consent form?

57
00:05:42,634 --> 00:05:47,931
Who takes the fall if one publishes
an article based on false information?

58
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:50,183
The writer!

59
00:05:50,183 --> 00:05:51,768
Have you read your contract?

60
00:05:52,018 --> 00:05:52,769
Ma’am...

61
00:05:52,769 --> 00:05:54,104
If I were you,

62
00:05:54,104 --> 00:05:57,607
I’d beg the accuser
to retract the lawsuit,

63
00:05:57,607 --> 00:06:00,527
or find scoops that’ll
get us more ads.

64
00:06:05,198 --> 00:06:06,658
You still don’t get it, do you?

65
00:06:10,412 --> 00:06:13,832
Clean up your own shit!

66
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:24,676
Hey, Choi Woo-won!

67
00:06:25,802 --> 00:06:26,720
Yeah, Na-young.

68
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:30,098
You said she was a girl,
but she turned out to be a guy!

69
00:06:30,098 --> 00:06:31,224
What are you saying?

70
00:06:31,725 --> 00:06:35,687
The Summer It girl I took photos of,
they say she’s a man!

71
00:06:35,937 --> 00:06:37,814
- A man?
- Yeah!

72
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:39,316
She was a dude.

73
00:06:39,774 --> 00:06:41,151
I was so sure she was a chick.

74
00:06:41,443 --> 00:06:44,321
I know, do you have
his contact info?

75
00:06:44,738 --> 00:06:45,530
What for?

76
00:06:45,530 --> 00:06:47,907
He reported me to
the press arbitration committee.

77
00:06:47,907 --> 00:06:49,743
He’ll sue me if I don’t
settle for $50,000.

78
00:06:49,743 --> 00:06:51,286
- $50,000?
- Yeah.

79
00:06:51,286 --> 00:06:53,288
- So you got it or not?
- I don’t have it!

80
00:06:53,788 --> 00:06:58,293
And I only called you because
you asked me for any scoops.

81
00:06:58,293 --> 00:06:59,127
No?

82
00:06:59,127 --> 00:07:03,381
I did, but why did she
have to be a man?!

83
00:07:04,049 --> 00:07:09,262
Anyway, if you ever see him again,
keep him here and call me, got it?

84
00:07:09,721 --> 00:07:10,597
What will you do?

85
00:07:11,264 --> 00:07:12,849
I have to find new stories.

86
00:07:13,308 --> 00:07:16,478
Something that’ll get a lot of
clicks, and bring in tons of ads.

87
00:07:17,437 --> 00:07:20,690
What am I saying? I didn’t
become a reporter to do this.

88
00:07:22,359 --> 00:07:24,736
My life has been a string
of unfortunate incidents.

89
00:07:25,195 --> 00:07:27,197
Nothing’s ever easy.

90
00:07:27,197 --> 00:07:31,826
At least you got a decent job,
and a home to boot.

91
00:07:31,826 --> 00:07:34,871
My dad lent it to me,
it’s not free.

92
00:07:34,871 --> 00:07:36,247
I’ll have to pay him back.

93
00:07:36,498 --> 00:07:37,165
Na-young.

94
00:07:37,957 --> 00:07:40,543
A man died last night at my station.

95
00:07:41,753 --> 00:07:42,587
What about that?

96
00:07:43,088 --> 00:07:44,798
I actually saw it on the news,

97
00:07:45,173 --> 00:07:50,637
and told my editor about
the derelict Oksu platform,

98
00:07:51,054 --> 00:07:53,348
but he wasn’t into suicides.

99
00:07:53,598 --> 00:07:54,224
Na-young.

100
00:07:54,683 --> 00:07:56,601
There’s more to it
than just suicide.

101
00:07:57,602 --> 00:07:58,019
Hey.

102
00:07:58,978 --> 00:07:59,646
Stop.

103
00:07:59,646 --> 00:08:00,689
What’s wrong?

104
00:08:00,689 --> 00:08:03,358
I don’t even want to think about it!

105
00:08:03,358 --> 00:08:06,736
Why don’t you tell her yourself?
You were the witness.

106
00:08:06,736 --> 00:08:07,737
Witness what?

107
00:08:12,534 --> 00:08:13,910
Good evening, chief.

108
00:08:14,411 --> 00:08:16,454
Are you bored?

109
00:08:19,999 --> 00:08:22,001
- Sir.
- Yeah?

110
00:08:22,502 --> 00:08:25,046
There’s a man on the old platform.

111
00:08:25,046 --> 00:08:25,839
Yeah?

112
00:08:34,139 --> 00:08:35,432
What the hell?

113
00:08:38,810 --> 00:08:41,187
Shit, why is it acting up now?

114
00:08:42,355 --> 00:08:44,190
Woo-won,
could you go check it out?

115
00:08:44,190 --> 00:08:46,901
A deadhead train is en route,
he could cause an accident.

116
00:08:46,901 --> 00:08:47,736
Yes, chief!

117
00:09:06,129 --> 00:09:08,590
Sir! It’s dangerous,
please come up!

118
00:09:11,051 --> 00:09:12,051
Dammit!

119
00:09:14,053 --> 00:09:15,013
Christ!

120
00:09:22,020 --> 00:09:23,062
What’s that?

121
00:09:24,105 --> 00:09:25,899
There was a child?

122
00:09:25,899 --> 00:09:26,608
Yes.

123
00:09:26,900 --> 00:09:27,567
You sure?

124
00:09:27,901 --> 00:09:29,027
I’m sure.

125
00:09:29,986 --> 00:09:33,948
Could this be the start of
Oksu station ghost story?

126
00:09:36,701 --> 00:09:39,245
Well, it’s too weak.

127
00:09:40,205 --> 00:09:45,752
If there was another witness other
than him, it’d be a story.

128
00:09:47,629 --> 00:09:51,633
The funeral director saw him too.

129
00:09:52,550 --> 00:09:54,719
Funeral director? Who’s that?

130
00:10:24,707 --> 00:10:26,709
You must be really into shamanism.

131
00:10:27,794 --> 00:10:30,505
My father exhibited
great spiritual connection.

132
00:10:31,965 --> 00:10:36,803
He should’ve been a shaman,
but ended up being an embalmer.

133
00:10:36,803 --> 00:10:39,264
So, you inherited the job?

134
00:10:39,597 --> 00:10:44,602
I embalmed bodies with
my father since I was 10 years old

135
00:10:44,853 --> 00:10:46,688
when Oksu first opened.

136
00:10:48,356 --> 00:10:50,733
You remember all that?

137
00:10:52,610 --> 00:10:53,695
How could I forget?

138
00:10:55,321 --> 00:11:00,910
My first body was an accident victim
as soon as Oksu opened,

139
00:11:01,703 --> 00:11:04,247
his body was torn to pieces.

140
00:11:04,539 --> 00:11:05,164
I see...

141
00:11:07,667 --> 00:11:12,046
I heard you witnessed
a child at the accident yesterday.

142
00:11:20,597 --> 00:11:24,559
Go easy on the booze already.

143
00:11:26,019 --> 00:11:28,646
It’s not booze,
it’s coffee.

144
00:12:07,977 --> 00:12:09,395
Why are you there?

145
00:12:11,022 --> 00:12:12,231
What’s your name?

146
00:12:15,276 --> 00:12:16,986
1211?

147
00:12:18,029 --> 00:12:19,447
That’s your name?

148
00:12:23,868 --> 00:12:26,287
- Sir?
- Yeah?

149
00:12:26,287 --> 00:12:28,539
There’s a big one here,
it looks like a leg!

150
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:29,707
Okay.

151
00:12:36,923 --> 00:12:41,052
She said her name was a number?

152
00:12:41,052 --> 00:12:43,012
She nodded her head.

153
00:12:53,022 --> 00:12:54,607
Have you met him?

154
00:12:54,607 --> 00:12:55,817
Yeah, just as you said.

155
00:12:56,192 --> 00:12:58,861
I could feel this article
getting a ton of views.

156
00:12:58,861 --> 00:13:00,613
I actually have a favor,

157
00:13:00,863 --> 00:13:04,033
could you get me a copy
of the security cam footage?

158
00:13:04,283 --> 00:13:05,243
Why should I?

159
00:13:05,702 --> 00:13:08,204
Articles like these won’t have
much credibility without photos.

160
00:13:08,496 --> 00:13:10,123
I’ll protect your identity.

161
00:13:10,581 --> 00:13:12,250
Please, Woo-won.

162
00:13:15,420 --> 00:13:16,546
Detective!

163
00:13:16,838 --> 00:13:17,839
Detective!

164
00:13:19,716 --> 00:13:23,970
Why are you harassing me
over old news?

165
00:13:24,429 --> 00:13:28,224
There was no mention of the kid,
the funeral director saw her.

166
00:13:29,058 --> 00:13:30,226
You believe that?

167
00:13:30,518 --> 00:13:33,896
He’s always drunk,
maybe he was hallucinating.

168
00:13:34,147 --> 00:13:35,523
It makes no sense.

169
00:13:35,523 --> 00:13:38,401
The subway clerk who was
at the accident saw her too.

170
00:13:43,114 --> 00:13:46,993
Look, stop trying to fish
a ghost story,

171
00:13:48,911 --> 00:13:50,121
and act like a reporter.

172
00:14:48,930 --> 00:14:50,473
Is anyone inside?

173
00:14:58,106 --> 00:15:00,066
Is someone there?

174
00:15:01,067 --> 00:15:05,113
If you’re sick or need help,
please let me know!

175
00:15:05,113 --> 00:15:07,115
I shouldn’t just open the stall...

176
00:15:33,724 --> 00:15:36,185
Were you scared?
You so were, dude!

177
00:15:36,477 --> 00:15:37,311
Fuck off.

178
00:15:38,688 --> 00:15:39,647
What the hell was that?

179
00:15:40,731 --> 00:15:41,941
Sorry, dude.

180
00:15:42,233 --> 00:15:44,193
I just thought it’d be funny.

181
00:15:44,735 --> 00:15:47,363
Can’t you read the room?

182
00:15:59,876 --> 00:16:01,752
1013?

183
00:16:03,588 --> 00:16:05,756
What’s with him?

184
00:16:09,135 --> 00:16:10,887
I’ll be back soon.

185
00:16:12,513 --> 00:16:13,598
- Hello.
- Hey.

186
00:16:15,892 --> 00:16:16,893
Chief, good evening.

187
00:16:17,602 --> 00:16:19,103
I see you often at night.

188
00:16:19,812 --> 00:16:22,523
I just feel so off
after what happened.

189
00:16:23,274 --> 00:16:24,942
Are you all right, chief?

190
00:16:25,234 --> 00:16:30,406
Nope, cleaning up the accident
is always a major headache.

191
00:16:32,491 --> 00:16:35,494
I had so much trouble
writing the statement.

192
00:17:03,606 --> 00:17:05,191
- Woo-won!
- Yes?

193
00:17:05,524 --> 00:17:09,695
Don’t get caught up in this ordeal,

194
00:17:09,695 --> 00:17:12,865
stay calm and stick with books, okay?

195
00:17:14,533 --> 00:17:17,161
I will, thank you.

196
00:17:29,173 --> 00:17:30,633
Holy shit...

197
00:17:37,098 --> 00:17:37,974
I’m sorry...

198
00:17:38,307 --> 00:17:39,267
0329...

199
00:17:46,732 --> 00:17:47,900
This is confidential, got it?

200
00:17:49,443 --> 00:17:51,988
I hear you, thank you.

201
00:17:54,198 --> 00:17:56,784
By the way, the conductor...

202
00:17:57,285 --> 00:17:58,327
What about him?

203
00:17:59,453 --> 00:18:02,957
He was roaming around
the station like a lunatic,

204
00:18:02,957 --> 00:18:04,750
he’s not a station affiliate.

205
00:18:05,501 --> 00:18:09,630
It feels so odd to see him
around the accident scene.

206
00:18:10,548 --> 00:18:12,383
- He’s still there?
- Yeah.

207
00:18:12,717 --> 00:18:15,845
I just saw him,
he went towards the platform.

208
00:18:54,634 --> 00:18:58,554
Hello, I’m Daily Modu’s
reporter Kim Na-young.

209
00:18:58,554 --> 00:19:02,433
Would it be okay to interview you?

210
00:19:05,728 --> 00:19:09,774
Why are you still here?

211
00:19:12,651 --> 00:19:14,737
It won’t come off...

212
00:19:15,780 --> 00:19:17,031
What won’t?

213
00:19:20,451 --> 00:19:21,327
That.

214
00:19:22,036 --> 00:19:23,496
That thing.

215
00:19:37,009 --> 00:19:41,680
Did you by any chance
see anyone else at the accident?

216
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:43,307
Was the victim only one?

217
00:19:44,683 --> 00:19:45,726
No...

218
00:19:47,269 --> 00:19:50,481
Two, there were two...

219
00:19:54,068 --> 00:19:55,611
0329...

220
00:19:56,487 --> 00:19:57,822
0329...

221
00:20:01,784 --> 00:20:02,827
Sir?

222
00:20:18,092 --> 00:20:19,009
Yes, hello?

223
00:20:19,009 --> 00:20:20,803
Na-young, this story is incredible.

224
00:20:21,595 --> 00:20:23,055
Did you see the video?

225
00:20:23,055 --> 00:20:24,348
Of course I did!

226
00:20:24,348 --> 00:20:25,766
How did you secure it?

227
00:20:25,766 --> 00:20:28,394
The boss wants this story
posted online ASAP.

228
00:20:28,394 --> 00:20:31,105
I need to follow-up
on one more thing,

229
00:20:31,105 --> 00:20:32,356
I’ll post it by 3 at the latest.

230
00:20:32,356 --> 00:20:33,858
Okay, good work!

231
00:21:31,081 --> 00:21:33,501
Excuse me?

232
00:21:35,252 --> 00:21:38,631
Could you tell me the significance

233
00:21:39,340 --> 00:21:44,011
of the number you said
on the platform?

234
00:21:45,596 --> 00:21:47,139
I have to say it.

235
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:53,020
Say what?

236
00:21:53,354 --> 00:21:54,647
I have to say it.

237
00:21:56,732 --> 00:21:57,858
1211?

238
00:21:57,858 --> 00:21:59,401
1013?

239
00:21:59,401 --> 00:22:03,239
Will you say it?
Will you call me?

240
00:22:04,532 --> 00:22:05,866
Sir?

241
00:22:05,866 --> 00:22:10,371
0329, 0329, 0329, 0329...

242
00:22:10,371 --> 00:22:13,916
Say it, say it, say it!

243
00:22:16,961 --> 00:22:18,128
Are you okay?

244
00:22:19,004 --> 00:22:20,256
I have to say it!

245
00:22:35,020 --> 00:22:39,024
Next stop is Oksu Station.

246
00:23:07,344 --> 00:23:08,804
3, 4!

247
00:23:08,804 --> 00:23:12,474
Congratulations,
congratulations!

248
00:23:12,474 --> 00:23:16,353
Happy birthday, Kim Na-young

249
00:23:16,353 --> 00:23:20,024
Congratulations,
congratulations!

250
00:23:20,024 --> 00:23:22,735
Happy birthday, Kim Na-young

251
00:23:26,780 --> 00:23:28,991
But today isn’t my birthday...

252
00:23:28,991 --> 00:23:32,453
You’re the fastest reporter
to reach 300,000 views.

253
00:23:32,453 --> 00:23:35,873
At this rate, the story will reach
a million views by tomorrow!

254
00:23:37,541 --> 00:23:39,877
If this isn’t your birthday,
then what is?

255
00:23:40,711 --> 00:23:41,754
It’s really not.

256
00:23:41,754 --> 00:23:43,130
Go on, blow them out.

257
00:23:45,549 --> 00:23:46,508
Kim Na-young.

258
00:23:49,595 --> 00:23:51,930
Did you really interview
the conductor yesterday?

259
00:23:52,306 --> 00:23:53,015
Yes.

260
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:55,434
What time was that?

261
00:23:56,101 --> 00:23:59,938
It was about 10,
is something wrong?

262
00:23:59,938 --> 00:24:02,691
He was supposedly dead by then.

263
00:24:03,609 --> 00:24:06,862
- The conductor is dead?
- Yeah, you moron!

264
00:24:07,404 --> 00:24:09,531
He committed suicide
around 9 last night!

265
00:24:09,531 --> 00:24:12,493
Who the hell did you interview?!

266
00:24:43,857 --> 00:24:46,485
That’s enough, please stop.

267
00:24:46,902 --> 00:24:49,780
You really messed up
this time, Ms. Kim.

268
00:24:51,156 --> 00:24:52,783
I’ll post a correction.

269
00:25:04,336 --> 00:25:05,254
Correct what?

270
00:25:05,921 --> 00:25:08,132
You really didn’t interview
the conductor?

271
00:25:09,466 --> 00:25:10,467
But...

272
00:25:10,467 --> 00:25:13,262
If you’ve never interviewed him,

273
00:25:13,262 --> 00:25:16,890
and fabricated a story,
then you should resign, no?

274
00:25:21,937 --> 00:25:23,522
Ms. Mo.

275
00:25:23,522 --> 00:25:28,360
I got a call from the sister
of the Oksu victim asking for Kim.

276
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:30,237
She’s on a row.

277
00:25:30,487 --> 00:25:32,322
Scoops are rolling into her lap.

278
00:25:33,657 --> 00:25:34,783
What’s with your clothes...

279
00:25:39,288 --> 00:25:40,330
Why aren’t you going?

280
00:25:40,581 --> 00:25:42,124
Right...

281
00:26:12,696 --> 00:26:14,698
Why did you want to see me?

282
00:26:19,661 --> 00:26:23,207
My brother worked as a chef,

283
00:26:24,249 --> 00:26:26,585
and I couldn’t understand

284
00:26:27,002 --> 00:26:29,630
why he went down there
in the first place.

285
00:26:30,923 --> 00:26:35,469
But I think he went there
to find a well.

286
00:26:36,804 --> 00:26:38,180
A well?

287
00:26:38,722 --> 00:26:41,767
Oksu district apparently had
a lot of wells.

288
00:26:41,767 --> 00:26:45,437
But during the construction of
the station, they were sealed.

289
00:26:47,564 --> 00:26:48,649
Actually,

290
00:26:50,692 --> 00:26:54,947
my dad died at the Oksu station.

291
00:26:55,989 --> 00:26:59,409
On the opening day of the station,
he fell off the platform,

292
00:27:00,494 --> 00:27:05,541
and even though my brother
and I witnessed it,

293
00:27:06,375 --> 00:27:08,961
we have no memories of it.

294
00:27:09,795 --> 00:27:11,755
That’s plausible.

295
00:27:11,755 --> 00:27:15,008
So, I tried hypnotherapy too,

296
00:27:16,468 --> 00:27:22,266
and whenever I try to remember,
I just see the well.

297
00:27:23,684 --> 00:27:27,855
I worked up the courage
to look down into it,

298
00:27:28,522 --> 00:27:30,482
but that’s where it ends.

299
00:27:30,482 --> 00:27:32,067
My hypnosis always ended there.

300
00:27:32,609 --> 00:27:39,700
So, I thought maybe my brother
went to look for the well for me.

301
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:41,952
I see...

302
00:27:46,832 --> 00:27:47,749
Why?

303
00:27:49,668 --> 00:27:51,253
Why?!

304
00:27:52,004 --> 00:27:53,755
Is it too far-fetched?

305
00:27:54,256 --> 00:27:57,009
Interpreting his death as such?

306
00:27:57,342 --> 00:27:58,760
Not at all.

307
00:28:02,014 --> 00:28:03,557
I’m sorry for screaming at you.

308
00:28:04,391 --> 00:28:11,690
But I want to believe that
he didn’t die in vain.

309
00:28:13,191 --> 00:28:16,361
There’s no such a thing
as a meaningless death.

310
00:28:16,737 --> 00:28:20,032
I’m ashamed of myself, actually,

311
00:28:20,032 --> 00:28:24,202
the accident had a victim,
but I didn’t bother looking into him.

312
00:28:28,040 --> 00:28:31,585
I know a place that could help us,

313
00:28:31,835 --> 00:28:35,130
there is an archive with records
that pre-date the internet.

314
00:29:10,749 --> 00:29:12,292
Have you seen the well photo?

315
00:29:12,292 --> 00:29:15,754
Yes, it’s exactly how I remember it.

316
00:29:15,754 --> 00:29:17,047
What about the next photo?

317
00:29:17,047 --> 00:29:19,508
Do you remember the orphanage?

318
00:29:20,842 --> 00:29:23,011
I remember the well so clearly,

319
00:29:24,346 --> 00:29:26,890
but I can’t remember
the orphanage at all.

320
00:29:26,890 --> 00:29:27,516
Okay.

321
00:29:27,516 --> 00:29:31,895
Anyway, I think the well
was near the Oksu station.

322
00:29:31,895 --> 00:29:38,568
What if your brother went to
the old platform to look for the well?

323
00:29:44,783 --> 00:29:47,911
Thanks, I was too scared
to come alone.

324
00:29:48,328 --> 00:29:50,288
Of course it’s scary.

325
00:29:50,664 --> 00:29:54,042
- I’m scared too.
- That’s what I’m thankful for.

326
00:29:54,501 --> 00:29:58,338
It’s fine,
I needed to cool my head.

327
00:31:06,698 --> 00:31:08,575
Nail scratches are quite deep, no?

328
00:31:10,702 --> 00:31:12,204
Nail scratches?

329
00:31:12,579 --> 00:31:14,456
Do you know why
I allowed you to film this?

330
00:31:15,207 --> 00:31:16,958
I’m not sure.

331
00:31:17,501 --> 00:31:20,170
Over 30 years since opening
of the Oksu station,

332
00:31:20,754 --> 00:31:25,133
everyone who died here
had these scratches.

333
00:31:26,176 --> 00:31:30,013
And you’re trying to
expose it to the world.

334
00:31:31,765 --> 00:31:33,517
I’m so thankful.

335
00:32:00,752 --> 00:32:05,924
My father said there was a big grudge
surrounding the Oksu station.

336
00:32:07,968 --> 00:32:12,889
Why are there so many
accidents recently?

337
00:32:13,181 --> 00:32:15,100
Not many, but stacked.

338
00:32:17,310 --> 00:32:18,937
Subway accidents are boring,

339
00:32:18,937 --> 00:32:22,691
if it’s boring,
people won’t care.

340
00:32:22,691 --> 00:32:27,821
Then why are innocent bystanders
receiving the curse?

341
00:32:27,821 --> 00:32:33,702
Grudge forces one to lash out
at the one who harmed you,

342
00:32:33,702 --> 00:32:37,873
but as time passes,
you realize no one will help,

343
00:32:38,874 --> 00:32:42,419
and the hatred expands to anyone.

344
00:32:43,420 --> 00:32:44,963
You’re blaming the world.

345
00:32:46,756 --> 00:32:50,343
Why should innocent people
have to be cursed?

346
00:32:50,802 --> 00:32:51,845
It’s simple.

347
00:32:52,470 --> 00:32:54,264
Because they’re unlucky.

348
00:32:55,515 --> 00:32:56,641
Unlucky...

349
00:33:31,426 --> 00:33:34,221
1001, come here!

350
00:33:58,620 --> 00:34:00,664
1001, come here!

351
00:35:27,042 --> 00:35:28,001
Hey, Kim Na-young!

352
00:35:28,418 --> 00:35:29,711
Get over here! Come!

353
00:35:29,961 --> 00:35:31,087
Come!

354
00:35:31,963 --> 00:35:35,216
This morning’s article
already hit 1 million views!

355
00:35:35,759 --> 00:35:37,010
Really?

356
00:35:37,010 --> 00:35:39,846
Yeah, you’re my lucky charm!

357
00:35:40,138 --> 00:35:41,556
People are taking selfies there.

358
00:35:41,556 --> 00:35:44,559
They’re reacting to the story.

359
00:35:44,976 --> 00:35:46,144
Selfies?

360
00:35:46,519 --> 00:35:47,645
Come here, come.

361
00:35:58,239 --> 00:35:58,865
This one too.

362
00:35:59,282 --> 00:36:00,700
The Summer It Girl’s selfie.

363
00:36:03,620 --> 00:36:06,748
She got over 100K likes already.

364
00:36:07,916 --> 00:36:09,626
And we just sit back and watch?

365
00:36:09,626 --> 00:36:11,836
If people keep posting these...

366
00:36:12,087 --> 00:36:15,423
Why can’t we allow this to happen?

367
00:36:15,423 --> 00:36:18,551
Posting selfies, mean comments,
it’s all in the fun.

368
00:36:18,551 --> 00:36:20,887
What if they get into accidents?

369
00:36:20,887 --> 00:36:26,851
We’ll get more clicks, more ads
and make more money.

370
00:36:30,021 --> 00:36:31,064
Na-young.

371
00:36:31,064 --> 00:36:34,609
We’re not an authentic news outlet,
it’s a gossip tabloid.

372
00:36:34,901 --> 00:36:37,487
Do not forget what we are.

373
00:36:39,989 --> 00:36:42,158
The boss is asking for you.

374
00:36:46,913 --> 00:36:48,415
Did you want to see me?

375
00:36:50,125 --> 00:36:53,211
$10K for yesterday’s,
$10K for today’s,

376
00:36:53,628 --> 00:36:55,797
hit the jackpot 3 more times.

377
00:36:55,797 --> 00:36:57,507
The company will take care
of your settlement.

378
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:00,260
Thank you.

379
00:37:00,260 --> 00:37:02,095
What follow-up stories
do you have in mind?

380
00:37:03,346 --> 00:37:06,307
I interviewed the embalmer
again yesterday,

381
00:37:06,558 --> 00:37:09,436
over 90% of those who died
in accidents at Oksu

382
00:37:09,436 --> 00:37:12,147
have nail scratch wounds
on their bodies.

383
00:37:12,147 --> 00:37:13,022
Evidence?

384
00:37:13,022 --> 00:37:14,983
He had photographic evidence.

385
00:37:16,276 --> 00:37:19,112
This is turning into a major epic.

386
00:37:19,612 --> 00:37:20,655
Good, anything else?

387
00:37:21,072 --> 00:37:25,326
I’d like to write about the victim,
Mr. Kang Tae-ho.

388
00:37:25,326 --> 00:37:26,077
Why him?

389
00:37:26,077 --> 00:37:28,872
His reason for going
to the old platform is interesting.

390
00:37:28,872 --> 00:37:32,459
He apparently went there to find
an old Oksu well.

391
00:37:32,959 --> 00:37:34,043
I’m not feeling it.

392
00:37:34,043 --> 00:37:35,837
I met his sister...

393
00:37:35,837 --> 00:37:36,754
Her?

394
00:37:37,297 --> 00:37:41,092
She was in and out of the asylum,
she can’t be credible.

395
00:37:41,468 --> 00:37:43,386
- Really?
- Yeah.

396
00:37:43,970 --> 00:37:45,680
This one feels off.

397
00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:46,431
Shelf this one.

398
00:37:47,307 --> 00:37:48,433
Got anything else?

399
00:37:59,861 --> 00:38:01,571
What the hell?!

400
00:38:03,656 --> 00:38:05,867
Sorry, sorry.

401
00:38:07,076 --> 00:38:08,077
You’re on night shift?

402
00:38:08,661 --> 00:38:09,370
Yeah, I am.

403
00:38:15,543 --> 00:38:17,253
- What’s this?
- What?

404
00:38:17,921 --> 00:38:19,339
What’s with the scratches?

405
00:38:19,339 --> 00:38:21,007
I don’t know, it just appeared.

406
00:38:21,841 --> 00:38:24,344
You were the one
who posted the Instagram selfie?

407
00:38:24,761 --> 00:38:26,679
I just did it for fun.

408
00:38:26,679 --> 00:38:29,182
It’s quite annoying
to see it get worse.

409
00:38:29,516 --> 00:38:30,808
I’ll get it checked out
on my off day.

410
00:38:31,726 --> 00:38:33,394
- Make sure to do so.
- I will.

411
00:38:34,020 --> 00:38:35,563
I won’t die, don’t worry.

412
00:38:35,897 --> 00:38:38,066
I wish you’d die, asshole.

413
00:38:48,535 --> 00:38:49,911
Dude.

414
00:38:50,370 --> 00:38:52,038
Isn’t he the Summer It Girl?

415
00:38:52,622 --> 00:38:54,999
Shouldn’t we grab him
and call Na-young?

416
00:38:56,918 --> 00:38:58,044
Let him be.

417
00:38:58,586 --> 00:39:00,588
Her paper has decided
to take care of it.

418
00:39:01,130 --> 00:39:03,174
Is that right?

419
00:39:04,008 --> 00:39:06,594
- Have fun.
- Later!

420
00:39:31,035 --> 00:39:34,747
What the fuck...

421
00:40:06,487 --> 00:40:08,239
A complaint was reported.

422
00:40:08,239 --> 00:40:13,202
Screams were heard from
women’s washroom by exit 3.

423
00:40:13,202 --> 00:40:15,955
I’m just outside,
I’ll check it out.

424
00:40:17,707 --> 00:40:20,293
If there’s anyone inside,
could you say something?

425
00:40:32,180 --> 00:40:34,515
I’m here about a complaint.

426
00:40:34,515 --> 00:40:37,060
If there’s someone here,
could you knock?

427
00:40:48,988 --> 00:40:50,114
Excuse me?

428
00:41:00,416 --> 00:41:01,542
Hello?

429
00:41:06,673 --> 00:41:07,924
Anyone inside?

430
00:42:08,693 --> 00:42:10,570
Sir, this is just wrong.

431
00:42:10,570 --> 00:42:15,033
This story blew up
and went nationwide.

432
00:42:15,033 --> 00:42:18,202
But this is the funeral
of a close friend.

433
00:42:19,454 --> 00:42:22,206
You had no problem taking pics
at the morgue, so why not this?

434
00:42:22,915 --> 00:42:23,666
Listen.

435
00:42:23,666 --> 00:42:27,462
If people aren’t mad at you,
you’re not doing your job as a reporter.

436
00:42:38,014 --> 00:42:39,807
You’re awfully busy.

437
00:42:39,807 --> 00:42:42,351
Even came to the funeral
to do your reporting.

438
00:42:42,351 --> 00:42:43,644
I’m not here for a report.

439
00:42:44,771 --> 00:42:48,524
I told you not to write
a ghost story for some clicks.

440
00:42:48,524 --> 00:42:50,693
Do not make accusations
without knowing the truth.

441
00:42:50,985 --> 00:42:52,779
A subway conductor, a tranny,
and now a subway clerk.

442
00:42:53,905 --> 00:42:56,199
How is it that anyone
associated with you end up dead?

443
00:42:56,908 --> 00:42:58,785
How could you say that?

444
00:42:58,785 --> 00:43:00,828
Are you insinuating that
I intended for this to happen?

445
00:43:00,828 --> 00:43:02,038
Am I wrong?

446
00:43:02,038 --> 00:43:05,708
Create an artificial buzz,
people mimic it,

447
00:43:05,708 --> 00:43:07,376
and end up dead.

448
00:43:07,376 --> 00:43:10,963
And yet, you walk scot-free.

449
00:43:22,892 --> 00:43:24,268
Woo-won.

450
00:43:40,284 --> 00:43:41,327
Hey.

451
00:43:46,457 --> 00:43:48,042
Na-young...

452
00:43:48,793 --> 00:43:51,629
- Have fun.
- Later!

453
00:44:26,914 --> 00:44:28,249
Those numbers...

454
00:44:31,836 --> 00:44:33,504
I didn’t want to say it...

455
00:44:35,006 --> 00:44:40,761
It felt as though I was possessed.

456
00:44:44,599 --> 00:44:48,394
The subway conductor,
the transgender...

457
00:44:51,606 --> 00:44:52,815
and even Seung-joon...

458
00:44:55,067 --> 00:44:57,320
They all died after
getting this scratch.

459
00:44:59,906 --> 00:45:01,073
I’ll end up like them too, right?

460
00:45:02,491 --> 00:45:06,329
Stop saying nonsense,
why should you die?

461
00:45:06,329 --> 00:45:08,122
What do those numbers mean?

462
00:45:08,122 --> 00:45:09,790
That’s not important right now.

463
00:45:11,208 --> 00:45:15,880
If you don’t want to die
for nothing, stay alert.

464
00:45:16,839 --> 00:45:17,673
Got it?

465
00:45:20,927 --> 00:45:21,719
Yeah...

466
00:47:05,823 --> 00:47:06,991
Are you okay?

467
00:47:09,577 --> 00:47:10,494
Yeah.

468
00:47:12,663 --> 00:47:14,582
I keep having the same dream.

469
00:47:15,249 --> 00:47:16,625
What dream?

470
00:47:20,337 --> 00:47:22,131
A well keeps showing up in it.

471
00:47:24,967 --> 00:47:26,135
A well?

472
00:47:26,969 --> 00:47:31,223
Yes, my friend keeps dreaming
about a well.

473
00:47:31,223 --> 00:47:33,392
He has nail scratches,

474
00:47:33,392 --> 00:47:35,811
and saw a 4-digit number.

475
00:47:40,316 --> 00:47:45,946
I wanted to ask you
if it had anything to do with you.

476
00:47:46,572 --> 00:47:51,535
If not, why’d he dream
about a well like you?

477
00:47:52,036 --> 00:47:53,079
Am I right?

478
00:47:53,537 --> 00:47:57,750
I was actually hesitating
to call you.

479
00:48:01,796 --> 00:48:05,966
I remembered something
while looking at his belongings.

480
00:48:06,759 --> 00:48:08,010
Really?

481
00:48:09,011 --> 00:48:10,971
The Oksu Orphanage...

482
00:48:11,931 --> 00:48:15,476
My father used to run it!

483
00:48:16,519 --> 00:48:21,649
And those numbers are
the admission dates of the children.

484
00:48:22,650 --> 00:48:24,401
And the dates when he got paid.

485
00:48:27,196 --> 00:48:32,910
Someone mentioned there was
a big grudge surrounding Oksu station,

486
00:48:33,244 --> 00:48:36,664
could it be about the children?

487
00:48:37,832 --> 00:48:40,835
Well, I’m not sure...

488
00:48:43,629 --> 00:48:47,800
Was there a phone
among your brother’s things?

489
00:49:06,986 --> 00:49:07,945
It turns on.

490
00:49:13,033 --> 00:49:15,452
There’s a video.

491
00:49:56,744 --> 00:50:00,206
This is Oksu station’s
old platform.

492
00:50:01,999 --> 00:50:07,087
If you go this way,
there’s an old construction tunnel.

493
00:50:25,648 --> 00:50:26,982
Here it is!

494
00:50:32,112 --> 00:50:33,447
No way...

495
00:50:35,324 --> 00:50:36,242
Are these...

496
00:50:39,161 --> 00:50:41,789
I found it, I finally found it!

497
00:50:44,750 --> 00:50:48,045
Those are bones, right?

498
00:50:50,089 --> 00:50:54,426
The children must be buried here.

499
00:51:16,824 --> 00:51:18,909
Security cam.

500
00:51:20,119 --> 00:51:21,537
I’ll go first.

501
00:51:34,216 --> 00:51:37,928
Watch out for the cam,
you have to crouch down.

502
00:51:41,807 --> 00:51:44,059
Do we really have to do this?

503
00:51:45,185 --> 00:51:46,520
We have to do something.

504
00:51:46,812 --> 00:51:49,148
Could they be asking us
to call their names

505
00:51:49,440 --> 00:51:52,651
to tell the world about
the injustice they suffered?

506
00:51:54,486 --> 00:51:56,405
That’s the least we can do.

507
00:51:56,947 --> 00:51:59,992
Who knows,
it could lift their grudge.

508
00:52:00,868 --> 00:52:04,663
Yeah, it’s better than
sitting around.

509
00:52:04,955 --> 00:52:05,914
Let’s go.

510
00:52:46,330 --> 00:52:48,248
- What are you doing?
- Christ...

511
00:52:49,041 --> 00:52:51,460
I wanted to film it just in case.

512
00:52:51,794 --> 00:52:53,253
Hold on.

513
00:52:56,048 --> 00:52:57,257
Recording.

514
00:53:20,531 --> 00:53:21,698
What’s wrong?

515
00:53:24,493 --> 00:53:25,536
There’s something in front of us.

516
00:53:45,264 --> 00:53:47,266
Woo-won, you okay?

517
00:53:50,310 --> 00:53:53,730
Yeah, I’m fine...

518
00:53:54,481 --> 00:53:56,775
Woo-won!

519
00:54:02,906 --> 00:54:04,408
Na-young?

520
00:54:16,753 --> 00:54:19,339
Woo-won! Woo-won!

521
00:54:22,217 --> 00:54:23,135
Woo-won!

522
00:54:25,762 --> 00:54:26,722
You okay?

523
00:54:29,141 --> 00:54:30,684
I’m not sure...

524
00:54:31,768 --> 00:54:33,437
I don’t know what’s going on...

525
00:54:34,855 --> 00:54:37,733
You kept walking alone,
you don’t remember?

526
00:54:38,734 --> 00:54:39,902
I did?

527
00:54:52,414 --> 00:54:54,791
I think it was here somewhere.

528
00:54:56,293 --> 00:54:58,504
It’s the same spot
we saw in the video.

529
00:56:27,759 --> 00:56:31,388
How did they end up
getting buried here?

530
00:57:40,916 --> 00:57:42,542
So it’s you guys...

531
00:57:47,756 --> 00:57:52,344
I’ll tell the world about
your grudge.

532
00:58:50,902 --> 00:58:52,779
How’s your wound?

533
00:58:58,493 --> 00:59:00,162
Still the same.

534
00:59:03,206 --> 00:59:08,170
It’s still a wound,
it’ll take time to heal.

535
00:59:16,720 --> 00:59:17,763
Yes.

536
00:59:18,930 --> 00:59:25,312
So, my brother can
have his funeral then?

537
00:59:27,647 --> 00:59:28,940
Yes.

538
00:59:40,786 --> 00:59:41,828
Go on.

539
00:59:42,662 --> 00:59:43,914
Why?

540
00:59:43,914 --> 00:59:44,915
Go.

541
01:00:04,184 --> 01:00:05,685
Did you sleep well?

542
01:00:06,812 --> 01:00:08,814
I wrote the incident report.

543
01:00:08,814 --> 01:00:10,899
I was guaranteed an exclusive,

544
01:00:11,149 --> 01:00:13,151
have you checked the article?

545
01:00:13,652 --> 01:00:15,570
Children who were only called
by numbers,

546
01:00:16,696 --> 01:00:17,948
wrongful deaths.

547
01:00:20,325 --> 01:00:23,537
Truths covered up
by Oksu station construction.

548
01:00:25,163 --> 01:00:26,540
That’s the gist of it?

549
01:00:27,082 --> 01:00:31,753
I thought I asked you to
drop the well story.

550
01:00:31,753 --> 01:00:33,463
And yet you still wrote it.

551
01:00:35,674 --> 01:00:37,133
It wasn’t intentional, ma’am.

552
01:00:38,385 --> 01:00:42,639
You thought I’d automatically bite
if you mentioned ‘exclusive’?

553
01:00:44,266 --> 01:00:47,352
I don’t need disobedient reporters.

554
01:00:51,606 --> 01:00:52,691
Yes, Ms. Mo?

555
01:00:52,691 --> 01:00:54,943
Put Kim Na-young on suspension
effective immediately.

556
01:00:57,237 --> 01:00:57,988
Ma’am!

557
01:00:57,988 --> 01:01:00,574
On what grounds?
Should I list them?!

558
01:01:01,825 --> 01:01:03,994
I’ll decide whether to
publish the article,

559
01:01:03,994 --> 01:01:08,248
you just go home and
think about what you did.

560
01:01:11,084 --> 01:01:12,043
Get out!

561
01:01:21,386 --> 01:01:23,763
Has she gone mad?
What’s with her?

562
01:01:23,763 --> 01:01:25,599
Listen to me,
she has a reason.

563
01:01:25,599 --> 01:01:27,976
When she was manning the city desk,

564
01:01:27,976 --> 01:01:29,853
she supposedly looked into that well,

565
01:01:29,853 --> 01:01:32,564
but believing that her findings
could delay the construction,

566
01:01:32,564 --> 01:01:34,149
her boss covered it up.

567
01:01:34,441 --> 01:01:37,068
Then you brought that in
as an exclusive,

568
01:01:37,068 --> 01:01:39,362
no wonder she went berserk.

569
01:01:39,362 --> 01:01:41,907
But how could she suspend me?

570
01:01:49,831 --> 01:01:50,832
Evening, sir.

571
01:01:52,125 --> 01:01:54,461
- Going home?
- Yes.

572
01:01:55,754 --> 01:02:01,009
Having gone through all that,
go home and get some rest.

573
01:02:02,135 --> 01:02:03,970
Everyone must be tired.

574
01:02:04,888 --> 01:02:06,973
I’ve never seen anything like it.

575
01:02:09,893 --> 01:02:11,144
I’m going to sleep!

576
01:02:11,728 --> 01:02:13,647
Good night, sir.

577
01:02:51,226 --> 01:02:52,477
Wait, wait, please!

578
01:02:54,604 --> 01:02:56,898
Where is it?

579
01:02:57,941 --> 01:02:59,109
What’s with you?

580
01:03:08,910 --> 01:03:10,245
Why...

581
01:03:45,280 --> 01:03:47,240
Why do I still have the scratches?

582
01:03:48,074 --> 01:03:50,160
Why do I still have them?!

583
01:03:50,535 --> 01:03:52,287
Yours disappeared!

584
01:03:52,287 --> 01:03:53,413
Tae-hee...

585
01:03:55,999 --> 01:03:58,043
Why do I still have them?!

586
01:03:58,710 --> 01:04:00,170
It’s simple.

587
01:04:00,712 --> 01:04:02,839
I transferred it to someone else.

588
01:04:06,051 --> 01:04:08,094
What are you doing?!

589
01:04:08,887 --> 01:04:10,597
- Please stop!
- Repeat after me!

590
01:04:10,597 --> 01:04:13,767
- 1211!
- No! Please!

591
01:04:13,767 --> 01:04:16,061
- Repeat after me!
- Please!

592
01:04:16,603 --> 01:04:18,438
Please don’t do this!

593
01:04:18,438 --> 01:04:19,314
For the last time...

594
01:04:20,523 --> 01:04:21,441
repeat after me!

595
01:04:23,526 --> 01:04:25,737
- 1.
- 1.

596
01:04:26,154 --> 01:04:29,115
- 2.
- 2.

597
01:04:29,115 --> 01:04:30,992
- 1.
- 1.

598
01:04:30,992 --> 01:04:33,828
- 1!
- 1.

599
01:04:33,828 --> 01:04:34,913
1211!

600
01:04:36,748 --> 01:04:38,166
1211!

601
01:04:50,887 --> 01:04:52,305
Appease their grudge?

602
01:04:53,807 --> 01:04:56,434
You thought such a deep grudge

603
01:04:57,268 --> 01:04:59,562
would suddenly disappear
as if it’s nothing at all?

604
01:05:00,980 --> 01:05:03,775
It won’t disappear
until their grudge is lifted.

605
01:05:06,194 --> 01:05:08,613
Until they’re satisfied!

606
01:05:27,298 --> 01:05:29,175
If it was so easy...

607
01:05:29,926 --> 01:05:33,721
you could have done it
a long time ago!

608
01:05:33,721 --> 01:05:38,393
Even if you know how,
you must figure out the grudge first.

609
01:05:40,270 --> 01:05:43,273
But that woman came by
and told me everything.

610
01:05:44,399 --> 01:05:48,111
She wanted to calm
her brother’s soul or something.

611
01:05:49,320 --> 01:05:50,321
And then...

612
01:05:50,321 --> 01:05:54,325
How did he find out
how to transfer the curse?

613
01:05:57,620 --> 01:06:02,167
His father was almost a shaman...

614
01:06:05,003 --> 01:06:06,796
But I’m here about something else.

615
01:06:10,884 --> 01:06:13,094
I finally remember.

616
01:06:13,094 --> 01:06:14,846
1211!

617
01:06:20,018 --> 01:06:21,895
Appease the vengeful spirits?

618
01:06:22,770 --> 01:06:26,191
It won’t disappear
until their grudge is lifted.

619
01:06:27,692 --> 01:06:30,236
Until they’re satisfied!

620
01:06:40,705 --> 01:06:42,540
I’m scared...

621
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:45,793
1211...

622
01:06:46,753 --> 01:06:50,757
1211, don’t be scared,
it’ll be okay.

623
01:07:02,769 --> 01:07:05,688
Today is civil defense training day.

624
01:07:06,522 --> 01:07:09,442
I will punish you
if you even let out a squeak.

625
01:07:10,526 --> 01:07:11,778
Be quiet.

626
01:07:20,995 --> 01:07:22,497
1001, you come up.

627
01:07:32,006 --> 01:07:33,132
1001...

628
01:07:37,387 --> 01:07:40,223
Ask him call my name up there.

629
01:07:42,225 --> 01:07:45,395
It’s really scary here.

630
01:07:45,395 --> 01:07:47,522
- Me too!
- My name too!

631
01:07:47,522 --> 01:07:50,608
- Mine too!
- Call my name!

632
01:07:50,608 --> 01:07:51,567
Be Quite

633
01:08:21,180 --> 01:08:22,432
Those kids...

634
01:08:25,935 --> 01:08:28,187
still remembered...

635
01:08:30,815 --> 01:08:34,027
That they could live
if their names are called.

636
01:08:36,529 --> 01:08:40,533
That’s why they wanted
their names called.

637
01:08:43,202 --> 01:08:49,292
My brother kept crying,
begging to get me out.

638
01:08:52,170 --> 01:08:56,632
My name was called for his sake.

639
01:08:58,092 --> 01:09:00,261
So your father wasn’t
your real father?

640
01:09:01,429 --> 01:09:02,889
We were adopted later.

641
01:09:04,932 --> 01:09:10,229
But why’d he bury them
while closing the orphanage?

642
01:09:32,460 --> 01:09:35,296
I found this among
my father’s things.

643
01:09:37,673 --> 01:09:39,842
It contains surgery dates
for the children.

644
01:09:41,219 --> 01:09:42,345
Surgery dates?

645
01:09:45,973 --> 01:09:46,974
That means...

646
01:09:48,726 --> 01:09:50,728
organ trafficking?

647
01:09:51,187 --> 01:09:57,276
He buried the children
to get rid of the evidence.

648
01:10:15,169 --> 01:10:16,045
So...

649
01:10:18,047 --> 01:10:20,258
who will you pass on the curse?

650
01:10:34,272 --> 01:10:35,440
Hello?

651
01:10:36,023 --> 01:10:37,400
Hello?

652
01:10:38,109 --> 01:10:39,026
Woo-won?

653
01:10:40,945 --> 01:10:42,572
What happened?

654
01:10:43,072 --> 01:10:45,491
I was worried, you weren’t
answering your phone.

655
01:10:47,827 --> 01:10:49,454
What’s this number?

656
01:10:49,454 --> 01:10:50,830
I lost my phone.

657
01:10:51,289 --> 01:10:53,833
I wanted to change my number
with the new phone.

658
01:10:55,126 --> 01:10:56,669
How’s the scratch?

659
01:10:56,669 --> 01:10:58,546
Same old.

660
01:10:59,255 --> 01:11:02,467
There will be a way,
let’s figure it out together.

661
01:11:02,467 --> 01:11:04,677
Yeah, thanks.

662
01:11:05,094 --> 01:11:08,973
I’ll give you my new number,

663
01:11:08,973 --> 01:11:11,684
can you text me later?

664
01:11:11,684 --> 01:11:13,561
Yeah, tell me.

665
01:11:13,561 --> 01:11:15,897
010-1764-0816.

666
01:11:15,897 --> 01:11:18,733
1764-0816.

667
01:11:19,233 --> 01:11:20,485
Did I get that right? 0816?

668
01:11:22,195 --> 01:11:24,489
Yeah, it is.

669
01:11:25,698 --> 01:11:28,117
Woo-won, what’s wrong?

670
01:11:36,751 --> 01:11:38,503
No way...

671
01:11:39,629 --> 01:11:42,965
I’m sorry, Na-young...

672
01:11:44,634 --> 01:11:46,677
Location isn’t important.

673
01:11:46,969 --> 01:11:49,096
You just have to stay close.

674
01:11:51,057 --> 01:11:53,100
How could you...

675
01:11:53,100 --> 01:11:54,227
I’m sorry.

676
01:11:55,645 --> 01:11:57,313
I really want to live.

677
01:12:00,066 --> 01:12:02,068
But it’s not as easy as you think.

678
01:12:03,027 --> 01:12:06,280
To transfer the curse,
you need a strong will.

679
01:12:06,906 --> 01:12:09,408
Because someone else
will need to die in your stead.

680
01:12:21,879 --> 01:12:26,050
Also, that person has to
know about the children.

681
01:12:26,384 --> 01:12:29,262
Doesn’t matter if he
believes the curse or not.

682
01:12:30,304 --> 01:12:34,225
Do you have someone in mind?

683
01:12:48,322 --> 01:12:50,324
What the hell?!

684
01:12:50,950 --> 01:12:53,202
Why is my byline missing
from my article?

685
01:12:53,536 --> 01:12:57,164
How could you steal my article
by switching the headline?!

686
01:12:58,124 --> 01:12:59,834
This is Head of HR.

687
01:13:00,209 --> 01:13:00,710
Yes?

688
01:13:01,460 --> 01:13:04,088
The boss would like you
to resign from your post.

689
01:13:14,599 --> 01:13:15,683
Kim Na-young.

690
01:13:24,066 --> 01:13:26,152
Is this what you wanted?

691
01:13:27,778 --> 01:13:29,488
Look at all the mess you made.

692
01:13:30,114 --> 01:13:34,619
If the cops link the killings
to your articles, it’s all over.

693
01:13:34,910 --> 01:13:38,164
And I barely stopped
the lawsuit from happening.

694
01:13:38,164 --> 01:13:38,956
But...

695
01:13:40,833 --> 01:13:43,794
if you keep acting up,
I can’t help you.

696
01:13:45,379 --> 01:13:47,048
I’m not interested in fighting either

697
01:13:48,215 --> 01:13:50,051
But let me ask you one thing.

698
01:13:50,384 --> 01:13:52,928
You knew the truth when you
covered the Oksu orphanage, right?

699
01:13:53,929 --> 01:13:56,223
That they were trying to
cover up the organ trafficking.

700
01:13:57,683 --> 01:14:01,896
Shortening the construction period
was just an excuse, right?

701
01:14:04,649 --> 01:14:05,858
What are you talking about?

702
01:14:07,193 --> 01:14:10,821
I came to resign,
can’t you at least tell me that?

703
01:14:11,072 --> 01:14:11,906
Am I right?

704
01:14:12,281 --> 01:14:17,161
Someone upstairs told you to bury it.

705
01:14:17,161 --> 01:14:18,287
To cover it up.

706
01:14:24,377 --> 01:14:25,378
Kim Na-young.

707
01:14:26,170 --> 01:14:28,172
Is life all that easy to you?

708
01:14:29,548 --> 01:14:32,885
I’m right,
it’s written on your face.

709
01:14:38,140 --> 01:14:41,435
Read this for me,
out loud.

710
01:14:43,312 --> 01:14:44,897
I’ve had it with you.

711
01:14:46,357 --> 01:14:47,817
What the hell are you doing?!

712
01:14:49,735 --> 01:14:51,237
Please read it for me.

713
01:14:51,946 --> 01:14:55,449
Then I’ll shut up and walk away.

714
01:15:00,705 --> 01:15:01,789
What is it?

715
01:15:01,789 --> 01:15:03,999
Who cares what it is?

716
01:15:03,999 --> 01:15:08,587
Read it for me,
then this letter is yours.

717
01:15:26,647 --> 01:15:28,315
0816, happy?

718
01:15:39,910 --> 01:15:42,079
Yes, happy.

719
01:15:44,165 --> 01:15:45,541
That was easy.
