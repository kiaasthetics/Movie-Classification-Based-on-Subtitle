1
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:46,800
Now, you see,

2
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:49,554
this is what we could be
doing on a holiday.

3
00:00:50,560 --> 00:00:53,950
Not all the hiking-up-mountains stuff
you're planning.

4
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:56,470
Tickles. Tickles.

5
00:00:57,720 --> 00:00:59,278
You want me to stop?

6
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:00,589
No.

7
00:01:00,760 --> 00:01:02,193
But it's 6:15.

8
00:01:02,360 --> 00:01:03,998
- 6:15?
- Mmm-hmm.

9
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:06,153
Oh, I gotta go.

10
00:01:12,040 --> 00:01:13,314
I'll cook tonight.

11
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:35,998
Don't even think about it.

12
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:37,519
It's pouring.

13
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:48,837
- Freddie! Ooh, whoa!
- Watch it!

14
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:50,314
Yeah, listen, I'm on it.

15
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:52,198
All right, the West Coast
will still be up.

16
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:55,432
I'll call Carmichael now
and we can close this.

17
00:01:57,800 --> 00:01:59,199
Taxi!

18
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:01,278
Yeah, we won't. Don't worry.

19
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:02,760
Look out!

20
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:34,069
Bye now!

21
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:36,231
Take care, John!

22
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:41,435
Um... How many in this one?

23
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:43,232
170 calories.

24
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:45,470
You did have that one yesterday.

25
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:47,634
What about that one, then?

26
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:49,074
220.

27
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:52,593
But it is less
if you eat them standing up.

28
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:55,434
- Oh!
- Yeah. Should we put them in a bag?

29
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:58,751
- Please. Come on.
- Yeah! Thanks, Frank.

30
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:09,954
I don't think I can finish this.

31
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:11,792
Shall we wrap it up for you, Daphne?

32
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,911
Have it later? Yeah.

33
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:29,439
I'm really sorry.

34
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:07,280
A month's money.
That's big of him.

35
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:09,237
Given she's worked
like a Trojan in that café

36
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:10,674
for the past six years.

37
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:12,671
He's closing down, love. He had no choice.

38
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:14,273
What the hell is she gonna do now?

39
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:16,416
Treena can't get any more
hours in the flower shop.

40
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:18,635
Lou will get another job.
She has a lot of potential.

41
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:22,679
There are no jobs, Josie. I should know.

42
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:24,637
Look, I'm just saying,

43
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:27,351
we needed that money.

44
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:29,272
Let's not panic, eh?

45
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:31,590
She'll find something. Won't you, Lou?

46
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:35,317
That's it, Callum! Go on!

47
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:37,794
Run with me, babe!

48
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:40,837
- Come on!
- Nah. Uh-uh.

49
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,116
- Only got two laps to go.
- Oh, God!

50
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:46,678
You just gotta get back out there.

51
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:48,876
Think what you wanna do.

52
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:50,336
- Estate agent, maybe.
- Ooh! Yeah.

53
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:51,873
Shop assistant. Catering.

54
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:53,598
Do we have to discuss this again?

55
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:55,478
Well, you can't just mope around.

56
00:04:55,640 --> 00:04:56,720
All the best entrepreneurs,

57
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:58,480
they fight their way back
from rock-bottom.

58
00:04:58,560 --> 00:04:59,560
Just look at me, eh!

59
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:01,199
Oh! But I'm not you, Pat.

60
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:03,231
I toast tea cakes.

61
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:04,958
Look, can't you slow down?

62
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:06,917
I'm wearing the wrong bra.

63
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:12,594
I'm just saying,

64
00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:15,149
put on a smile, and head back
to the job center.

65
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:17,072
Don't worry about the holiday.

66
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:18,639
I'll pay.

67
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,035
So the last two weeks,

68
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:27,997
we've tried the chicken
processing factory...

69
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:29,816
I'm still having nightmares
about those giblets.

70
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:31,216
- We've tried beautician.
- Turns out

71
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:32,309
hot wax is not my friend.

72
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:34,550
I'm running out of options
for you here, Louisa.

73
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:36,790
Syed, please! I'll take anything.

74
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Oh!

75
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:41,713
This is new in.

76
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:43,916
It's not far from your home.

77
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:47,436
But you might need to do something
about your wardrobe for this one.

78
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:48,600
Hmm?

79
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:51,433
Care and companionship for a disabled man.

80
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:52,760
What kind of care?

81
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:55,115
Needs someone to drive, feed and assist.

82
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:57,748
Six-month, fixed-term contract.

83
00:05:58,040 --> 00:06:00,429
Oh! And it's good money.

84
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:02,238
It's actually excellent money.

85
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:05,073
It's the fifth time
they've tried to recruit.

86
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:06,878
They're desperate.

87
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:10,112
There's nothing on here
about needing skills.

88
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:11,349
It's perfect for you.

89
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:12,714
Yeah?

90
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:15,078
I know it's not how you like to dress.

91
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:17,276
Is it how anyone likes to dress?

92
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:19,118
- It served me very well.
- Oh!

93
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:21,236
In 1983!

94
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:23,112
Styles change, love,

95
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:26,357
- but smart remains smart.
- Uh-huh.

96
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:40,157
- Thank you.
- Bye, love.

97
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:51,397
Oh!

98
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:05,478
- You must be Louisa Clark.
- Yeah.

99
00:07:05,640 --> 00:07:07,995
I'm Camilla Traynor. Do come in.

100
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:24,353
Please, sit down.

101
00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:25,635
Oh, okay.

102
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:29,473
Do you have any experience of caregiving?

103
00:07:29,640 --> 00:07:31,640
Um, I've never done it,
but I'm sure I could learn.

104
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:33,560
Do you have any experience
with quadriplegia?

105
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:35,358
Er, no.

106
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:38,276
We are talking about complete
loss of the legs,

107
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:40,510
and very limited use
of the arms and the hands.

108
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:41,680
Would that bother you?

109
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:44,035
Not as much as it would
bother him. Obviously.

110
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:45,200
Sorry.

111
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:46,719
Sorry. No, I didn't... No, uh...

112
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:48,029
No, I...

113
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:52,596
- Are you all right?
- Um, I'm...

114
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:53,840
I'm just a little hot.

115
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,036
Do you mind if I take off my jacket?

116
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:01,549
Your previous employer, here, says

117
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:05,235
you are a warm, chatty
and life-enhancing presence

118
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:06,674
with a lot of potential.

119
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:08,359
Yes, I paid him.

120
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:12,556
So, what exactly do you
want to do with your life?

121
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:14,034
Sorry?

122
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:16,794
Do you have aspirations for a career,

123
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:19,633
or a professional dream
that you wish to pursue?

124
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:20,915
- Um, well...
- Miss Clark,

125
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:24,914
why should I employ you
instead of, say, the previous candidate?

126
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
Um...

127
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:31,077
Really, you can't think of a single reason
why I should employ you?

128
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:33,635
Well, no. Yes, Mrs. Traynor.
I'm...

129
00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:35,597
I'm a fast learner.

130
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:36,795
And I'm never ill.

131
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:39,428
And I only live on
the other side of the castle.

132
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:41,909
And I'm stronger than I look.
And I just...

133
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:43,758
I make a mean cup of tea.

134
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:45,696
You know, there really isn't
much that can't be solved

135
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:47,551
by a decent cup of tea.

136
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:51,235
Not that I'm saying that your husband's
paraplegia... Quadriplegia

137
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:52,760
- can be solved by...
- My husband?

138
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:55,159
It's my son.

139
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:56,954
Your son.

140
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:01,793
Will was injured in
a road accident two years ago.

141
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:03,109
Oh, I'm sorry.

142
00:09:03,280 --> 00:09:06,477
When I'm nervous, I just say stupid stuff.

143
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:08,517
I'm just popping out.

144
00:09:08,680 --> 00:09:10,716
Oh, another interviewee.

145
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:12,800
Will you be back this evening?

146
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:15,428
I'll do my best. Why?
Do you need me for something?

147
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:16,919
No, darling. Fine.

148
00:09:17,560 --> 00:09:19,278
Hello. I'm Stephen. Will's father.

149
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:23,471
Louisa Clark.

150
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:25,119
Nice to meet you.

151
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:27,032
Lovely to meet you.

152
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:28,993
- See you later, darling.
- Mmm-hmm.

153
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:39,678
So.

154
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:41,474
Hmm.

155
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:44,239
Would you like the job?

156
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:46,840
Yes!

157
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,149
Can you start immediately?

158
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:49,469
Yes!

159
00:09:49,640 --> 00:09:50,640
Good.

160
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:53,030
Then let's go and meet Will.

161
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:55,475
Right, yeah. Okay. Um, sure.

162
00:09:55,640 --> 00:09:58,074
The hours are 8:00 to 5:00,
Monday to Saturday.

163
00:09:58,280 --> 00:09:59,315
If, for whatever reason,

164
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:01,357
you're running late
or you need to leave early,

165
00:10:01,520 --> 00:10:03,317
- please call and let me know.
- Okay.

166
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:05,198
I must stress

167
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:08,955
that Will should not be left alone
for longer than 15 minutes.

168
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,194
And, uh...

169
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:14,309
You might want to wear something
a little less revealing.

170
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:16,712
Oh, yes, of course.

171
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:20,915
This is the annex.

172
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:23,992
It was the stables before
we had it adapted for Will.

173
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:30,192
Um, I'll give you a set of car keys,
and put you on the insurance.

174
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:33,440
Nathan will show you how to use the ramp.

175
00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:35,917
There's a bathroom in here.

176
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:42,672
Tea and coffee are in this cupboard here.

177
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:44,759
You're welcome to help yourself.

178
00:10:45,640 --> 00:10:47,596
And there is always food in the fridge.

179
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:52,388
You and Will can work out
your level of interaction yourselves.

180
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:54,039
Um, obviously...

181
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:56,509
Well, I would hope that you could get on.

182
00:10:56,680 --> 00:10:58,760
It would be nice if he could
think of you as a friend

183
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:00,711
rather than a paid professional.

184
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:02,632
Do you have any questions?

185
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:03,800
No.

186
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:05,256
Then let's introduce you to Will.

187
00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:06,400
He should be dressed by now.

188
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:12,754
He has good days and bad days.

189
00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:15,593
Mrs. Traynor, I won't let you down.

190
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:17,755
Good.

191
00:11:18,280 --> 00:11:20,475
I have someone to meet you.

192
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:22,676
Yeah, he's decent, Mrs. T.

193
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:26,354
Will, this is Louisa Clark.

194
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:32,429
I'm Lou!

195
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:38,336
Will.

196
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:39,429
William.

197
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:45,119
William, please.

198
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:49,993
Hello, Louisa Clark. I'm Will Traynor.

199
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:53,711
You appear to have a problem
with your skirt.

200
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:58,677
You're a bad man, Mr. T.

201
00:11:58,840 --> 00:12:00,273
G'day. I'm Nathan.

202
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:04,155
Right.

203
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:05,560
Well, I'll leave you to get on.

204
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:09,275
Miss Clark, Nathan will talk you
through Will's routines and equipment.

205
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:11,476
You don't have to talk across me, Mother.

206
00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:13,471
My brain isn't paralyzed.

207
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:15,360
Yet.

208
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:32,155
I'm Lou!

209
00:12:33,640 --> 00:12:35,870
Yeah. You already said that.

210
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:40,757
Shall I make us all a cup of tea?

211
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:42,678
Wrench! Where's my wrench?

212
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:44,831
Mum, did you turn down the gas on my veg?

213
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,400
That's the cutlery drawer, Bernard.

214
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:47,656
And you're getting oil everywhere.

215
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:48,816
Everything will be soggy again.

216
00:12:48,840 --> 00:12:51,400
Yeah, well, things turn up in
strange places in this house.

217
00:12:51,560 --> 00:12:53,869
- Auntie Lou! Auntie Lou!
- Oh!

218
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:58,195
- You got it, didn't you?
- Uh...

219
00:12:58,760 --> 00:12:59,829
Yeah!

220
00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:04,880
Yay!

221
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:07,190
Louisa Clark, working for the Traynors.

222
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:08,839
Wonders will never cease.

223
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,040
Uh, yeah.

224
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:18,029
Okay.

225
00:13:19,880 --> 00:13:23,429
This tells you pretty much
everything you need to know.

226
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:25,556
Now, I do most of the heavy lifting,

227
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:29,508
but there's a timetable here
so you can see what he has, when.

228
00:13:31,280 --> 00:13:32,713
I have to handle drugs?

229
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:36,395
Blood-pressure meds to raise it
in the morning when he gets up.

230
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:37,913
Anti-spasm tablets.

231
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:40,514
Four times a day
to control muscular spasms.

232
00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:42,557
Tablets for nerve pain.

233
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:45,757
Um, now, you can give him
painkillers, if he asks.

234
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:48,559
Just try to resist giving him
sleeping pills, if possible.

235
00:13:48,760 --> 00:13:52,196
They tend to make him
a little bit, um, you know, irritable.

236
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:55,193
No, uh... More irritable.

237
00:13:57,600 --> 00:13:58,715
It's a lot to remember.

238
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:00,279
Well, it's all written down.

239
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:01,754
You know, he knows what's what.

240
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:03,433
Though, he might deny it.

241
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:04,749
And you got my number.

242
00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:07,280
Most of my other patients are nearby,
so I'm never far away.

243
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:09,550
What if he needs to... Uh...

244
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:10,755
No, don't worry.

245
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:12,797
You're not here for
any of the physical stuff.

246
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:16,399
What am I here for?

247
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:18,799
To cheer him up, I guess.

248
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:34,480
Hello.

249
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:36,999
Hello.

250
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:39,256
So I thought we could
go out this afternoon.

251
00:14:39,280 --> 00:14:40,560
Where do you have in mind?

252
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:43,520
Well, I was told that you had a car
that was adapted for wheelchair use.

253
00:14:43,640 --> 00:14:46,074
And you thought a drive
would be good for me.

254
00:14:46,280 --> 00:14:48,748
A breath of fresh air.

255
00:14:48,920 --> 00:14:50,114
What do you usually do?

256
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:51,600
I don't do anything, Miss Clark.

257
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:54,791
I sit. I just about exist.

258
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:57,155
Okay. Well, I could get you your computer.

259
00:14:57,320 --> 00:14:59,993
Have you found a good quad
support group I could join?

260
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:01,639
Quads "R" Us?

261
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:03,631
The Tin Wheels Club?

262
00:15:04,840 --> 00:15:07,832
Or perhaps we could
get to know each other a bit.

263
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:12,073
You know, because then you could tell me
what you do like to do.

264
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:14,679
May...

265
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:16,034
Maybe.

266
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:26,035
Here's what I know about you, Miss Clark.

267
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:27,679
My mother says you're chatty.

268
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:28,875
Yeah.

269
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:30,155
Can we strike a deal?

270
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:34,717
Whereby you are very un-chatty around me?

271
00:15:41,880 --> 00:15:43,029
Okay.

272
00:15:45,560 --> 00:15:49,109
Yeah, well, I'll just be in the kitchen
if, you know, need anything.

273
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:51,034
Lovely.

274
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:25,990
So, how was he?

275
00:16:26,520 --> 00:16:29,671
He done his Stephen Hawking impression yet
or just stuck with My Left Foot?

276
00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:31,080
Ah, he's fine!

277
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:33,435
Okay. Well, you can take lunch now.

278
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:37,036
Me and Mr. T. have a few things
to take care of at this time of day.

279
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:09,113
Good morning!

280
00:17:13,960 --> 00:17:15,313
Hi!

281
00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:20,440
Not a great day.

282
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:21,959
Would you like a cup of tea?

283
00:17:33,040 --> 00:17:34,234
Sorry.

284
00:17:39,680 --> 00:17:40,749
Val d'Isère.

285
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:43,473
Good snow that year.

286
00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:44,914
Sorry. I was... I was...

287
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:47,680
You were just looking at my photographs,

288
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:50,195
thinking how awful it must be
to have lived like that

289
00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:51,679
and ended up like this.

290
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:54,720
The rest are in the drawer
if you'd like to snoop around further.

291
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:16,839
Good morning.

292
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:19,954
Every time I speak,
he looks at me like I'm stupid.

293
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:22,151
To be fair, you are pretty stupid.

294
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:24,880
Yeah, but he doesn't know that yet.

295
00:18:25,680 --> 00:18:27,352
Maybe he's like that with everyone

296
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:29,376
until he knows whether
they're gonna stick around.

297
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:30,680
I mean, it's only been 10 days.

298
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:32,029
Feels like a lifetime.

299
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:33,553
Well, you can't quit, Lou.

300
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:35,870
Yeah? Watch me.

301
00:18:39,080 --> 00:18:40,080
Um...

302
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:45,073
Look, I'm thinking of
going back to college.

303
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:47,896
Someone's dropped out of business studies
and they can take me back.

304
00:18:47,920 --> 00:18:49,353
What? What about Thomas?

305
00:18:49,560 --> 00:18:52,757
There's a nursery on campus.
We'd come back at weekends.

306
00:18:53,720 --> 00:18:55,136
I don't have a Patrick, Lou.

307
00:18:55,160 --> 00:18:57,674
I don't think I'm ever gonna
have a Patrick.

308
00:18:57,840 --> 00:18:59,034
I need this.

309
00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:00,434
Oh, I get it.

310
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:02,875
You just need me to stay here
in my miserable job,

311
00:19:03,040 --> 00:19:04,268
so I can help Mum and Dad.

312
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:06,556
- I've done my fair share.
- Yeah?

313
00:19:07,640 --> 00:19:10,632
I can't stay here.

314
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:12,870
You know I can't.

315
00:19:13,040 --> 00:19:15,873
Please, for me and Tom.

316
00:19:32,680 --> 00:19:36,719
Louisa, some visitors are on their way.

317
00:19:37,560 --> 00:19:40,074
Friends of Will's. It's unexpected.

318
00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:41,635
You might need to...

319
00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:43,518
Oh, I'll make some tea or coffee.

320
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:45,477
And I'll make myself scarce.

321
00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:47,751
Yes, that would be good.

322
00:19:48,360 --> 00:19:49,918
I think I'll...

323
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:54,231
I think I'll leave them to it.

324
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:03,280
So how's the physio and stuff?

325
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:05,670
All coming on? Any improvements?

326
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:07,159
No.

327
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,069
Well, you look great.

328
00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:10,639
- Yeah.
- So...

329
00:20:13,160 --> 00:20:14,309
So.

330
00:20:14,520 --> 00:20:16,431
To what do I owe this pleasure?

331
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:19,616
I'm sorry it's been so long.
I've been so busy.

332
00:20:19,640 --> 00:20:21,696
They've been really working me hard.
I mean, weekends.

333
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:23,517
Yeah, things are manic at the office, too.

334
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:24,874
New chap from New York.

335
00:20:25,040 --> 00:20:26,296
Bains! You ever come across him at all?

336
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:27,435
No.

337
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:29,795
Fearsome. Total monster!

338
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:32,394
Most days I feel I can
hardly leave my chair.

339
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:49,197
Please say something.

340
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:54,270
Congratulations.

341
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:56,152
Neither of us meant for this to happen.

342
00:20:56,320 --> 00:20:58,356
We were just friends for ages.

343
00:20:58,520 --> 00:20:59,635
And if truth be told,

344
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:02,040
Rupert was the most terrific
support after your accident.

345
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:03,309
Big of him.

346
00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:04,708
Oh, Will, please. I...

347
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:08,636
We should probably go.

348
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:16,029
I'm sorry, Will. I really am.

349
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:17,200
We both are.

350
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:20,591
And I... We really do hope
things improve for you.

351
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:43,480
Thank you.

352
00:21:43,640 --> 00:21:45,278
You know, I tried for months.

353
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:47,160
He just pushed me away.
Didn't want me here.

354
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:51,719
You can only help someone
who actually wants to be helped.

355
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:10,959
I was wondering if you wanted me to...

356
00:22:20,440 --> 00:22:23,056
Right, well, you better not move
until I've cleaned that up because

357
00:22:23,080 --> 00:22:26,038
I've got no idea what I'd do
if you pop a tire.

358
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:34,472
It was awful!

359
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:38,349
It's his girlfriend and his best friend.

360
00:22:38,520 --> 00:22:40,078
You can't blame her.

361
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:41,776
Are you really saying that
you'd stick around with me

362
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:43,176
if I was paralyzed from the neck down?

363
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:45,111
Of course I would.

364
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:48,397
Well, I wouldn't want someone
staying with me out of pity.

365
00:22:48,560 --> 00:22:50,994
I mean, strangers wipe your arse. Jesus!

366
00:22:51,160 --> 00:22:52,880
And think of all the things
you couldn't do.

367
00:22:53,040 --> 00:22:55,793
No more running, no more cycling.

368
00:22:55,960 --> 00:22:56,995
No more sex.

369
00:22:57,160 --> 00:22:58,776
Of course, you could have sex.

370
00:22:58,800 --> 00:23:00,756
It's just the girl would
have to be on top.

371
00:23:00,920 --> 00:23:03,150
- Oh, well, we'd be doomed, then.
- Mmm.

372
00:23:03,960 --> 00:23:05,632
- Hey, listen.
- Yeah.

373
00:23:05,800 --> 00:23:07,711
- About the holiday.
- Yeah.

374
00:23:07,880 --> 00:23:10,474
How do you fancy...

375
00:23:10,760 --> 00:23:11,760
Norway?

376
00:23:11,920 --> 00:23:13,273
Norway.

377
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:14,800
Wow.

378
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:17,999
Yeah! Okay. Whoo!

379
00:23:18,280 --> 00:23:19,633
- Great!
- Yeah.

380
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:22,475
Boys, I'm in.

381
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:24,870
- What?
- Yes! Nice one!

382
00:23:25,040 --> 00:23:27,349
Um, no, wait.
We're, you're in what?

383
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,831
The Viking Triathlon.

384
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,673
Sixty miles on a bike, 30 miles on foot,

385
00:23:32,840 --> 00:23:35,752
and then a nice swim
through sub-zero Nordic seas.

386
00:23:35,920 --> 00:23:36,989
Yeah!

387
00:23:37,160 --> 00:23:38,639
That's our holiday?

388
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:40,119
Yeah, but not all of it.

389
00:23:40,280 --> 00:23:42,919
Just the beginning,
and then we'll sightsee, or whatever.

390
00:23:43,080 --> 00:23:45,594
Look, I have never been fitter, Lou.

391
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:47,830
This is the year to do it.

392
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:13,954
I just thought I'd see
if I could fix some of these.

393
00:24:15,240 --> 00:24:17,276
Or, um, if you wanted to get new ones,

394
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:18,696
I could go into town at lunch time.

395
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:19,720
Or we could both go.

396
00:24:19,880 --> 00:24:20,995
Do you know what, Louisa?

397
00:24:21,160 --> 00:24:23,754
Me smashing those photographs
was not an accident.

398
00:24:24,920 --> 00:24:26,592
Sorry. I didn't think...

399
00:24:26,760 --> 00:24:28,876
You thought you knew best.

400
00:24:29,040 --> 00:24:30,880
Well, I don't want those
pictures staring at me

401
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:32,080
every time I'm stuck in bed,

402
00:24:32,160 --> 00:24:34,549
waiting for someone to bloody
get me out again. Okay?

403
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:36,870
I wasn't going to fix the one of Alicia.

404
00:24:37,040 --> 00:24:38,519
I'm not that stupid.

405
00:24:38,680 --> 00:24:39,908
Spare me the cod psychology.

406
00:24:40,120 --> 00:24:42,509
Just go and raid your grandma's wardrobe,

407
00:24:42,680 --> 00:24:44,910
or whatever it is you do
when you're not making tea.

408
00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:48,870
You don't have to be an arse!

409
00:24:50,800 --> 00:24:52,320
Your friends got the shitty treatment.

410
00:24:52,360 --> 00:24:53,360
Fine. They deserved it.

411
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:55,954
I'm just trying to do my job
as best I can.

412
00:24:56,120 --> 00:24:57,160
So it would be really nice

413
00:24:57,280 --> 00:24:59,120
if you didn't try and make
my life as miserable

414
00:24:59,160 --> 00:25:01,071
as you apparently make everyone else's.

415
00:25:01,240 --> 00:25:02,992
What if I said I didn't want you here?

416
00:25:03,160 --> 00:25:05,879
I'm not employed by you.
I'm employed by your mother.

417
00:25:06,040 --> 00:25:08,952
So unless she says she doesn't want me
here anymore, I'm staying.

418
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:12,874
Not because I care about you,
or particularly enjoy your company,

419
00:25:13,040 --> 00:25:15,315
but because I need the money.

420
00:25:16,440 --> 00:25:18,271
I really need the money.

421
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:24,070
Just put them in the drawer.

422
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:01,234
Hi. Am I needed?

423
00:26:01,400 --> 00:26:03,630
DVD weather, I think.

424
00:26:04,280 --> 00:26:06,236
Des Hommes Et Des Dieux.

425
00:26:13,880 --> 00:26:15,313
Something about men?

426
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:17,955
Yes, it's French gay porn.

427
00:26:19,640 --> 00:26:21,790
You really don't enjoy sarcasm, do you?

428
00:26:21,960 --> 00:26:24,633
Sarcasm is fine.
I just don't like superiority.

429
00:26:24,800 --> 00:26:26,631
You must hate me, then.

430
00:26:28,040 --> 00:26:30,270
I've never hated anyone.

431
00:26:33,160 --> 00:26:35,469
Let me know if you need anything.

432
00:26:37,160 --> 00:26:38,798
Have you seen it?

433
00:26:40,040 --> 00:26:42,349
I don't really like those kind of films.

434
00:26:42,840 --> 00:26:44,558
Those kind of films?

435
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:46,199
Films with subtitles.

436
00:26:46,360 --> 00:26:48,430
What, did your school
not teach you to read?

437
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:50,360
Sit down.

438
00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:52,950
Watch this with me. That's an order.

439
00:27:24,920 --> 00:27:27,275
- So?
- Well, they could have left.

440
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:29,510
- They chose to stay.
- Yeah, no, I get it.

441
00:27:29,680 --> 00:27:31,096
Being there gave their lives more meaning.

442
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:32,600
- But that's...
- But you don't agree.

443
00:27:32,680 --> 00:27:34,910
Well, to sacrifice themselves like that!

444
00:27:35,080 --> 00:27:36,256
I mean, could you even imagine?

445
00:27:36,280 --> 00:27:37,952
But you liked the film?

446
00:27:38,120 --> 00:27:39,473
I loved it.

447
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:42,560
Oh, if you're laughing at me,

448
00:27:42,760 --> 00:27:43,936
I swear to God,
I'll push you out that chair.

449
00:27:43,960 --> 00:27:45,837
I'm not laughing at you.

450
00:27:47,160 --> 00:27:50,232
The sky is clearing.
Shall we get some air?

451
00:27:51,560 --> 00:27:52,754
I'm just amazed

452
00:27:52,920 --> 00:27:54,911
that you could reach
the ripe old age of, what?

453
00:27:55,080 --> 00:27:56,080
Twenty-six.

454
00:27:56,240 --> 00:27:59,391
Twenty-six, and never have
watched a film with subtitles.

455
00:27:59,560 --> 00:28:04,315
Oh, well, I'm just amazed
that you've reached the ripe old age of 31

456
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:07,756
without being locked in a cupboard
for being such a snob.

457
00:28:07,920 --> 00:28:09,069
What?

458
00:28:09,240 --> 00:28:11,071
E.T. is my favorite film.

459
00:28:11,240 --> 00:28:12,992
E.T. is everyone's favorite film.

460
00:28:13,160 --> 00:28:15,390
- I've seen every Bond.
- So has the world.

461
00:28:15,560 --> 00:28:18,313
And I've got a soft spot for Armageddon.

462
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:19,549
Bruce Willis.

463
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:22,877
Oil driller has to save the world
from an asteroid. He does.

464
00:28:23,040 --> 00:28:24,632
That's better.

465
00:28:24,800 --> 00:28:27,473
So what do you do with yourself
when you're not here, Louisa Clark?

466
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:31,636
I, uh... I spend time with my family.

467
00:28:31,800 --> 00:28:33,916
And I go to the pub.

468
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:36,548
I watch TV.

469
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:38,358
I... Oh, I watch Patrick running.

470
00:28:38,520 --> 00:28:40,317
- Patrick's your boyfriend?
- Yeah.

471
00:28:40,920 --> 00:28:42,478
But you don't run with him?

472
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:44,710
I'm not exactly built for it.

473
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:46,791
This is an impressive list of hobbies.

474
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:49,155
Well, no, no. Okay, I read a bit.

475
00:28:49,320 --> 00:28:51,276
And I like clothes.

476
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:53,158
You like clothes?

477
00:28:55,320 --> 00:28:56,878
I don't do much, okay?

478
00:28:57,040 --> 00:28:59,270
I go to work and I go home, and that's it.

479
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:00,589
Wow.

480
00:29:01,480 --> 00:29:03,914
Your life's even duller than mine.

481
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:10,277
He's in a good mood.

482
00:29:10,440 --> 00:29:13,671
He told me all about you offering him
the pasta with green gravy.

483
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:17,150
I've... I've never
had pesto sauce before.

484
00:29:17,320 --> 00:29:19,880
No, whatever. It's all good.

485
00:29:20,040 --> 00:29:23,237
It's a long time since
he's laughed at anything.

486
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:48,195
Hey.

487
00:29:50,120 --> 00:29:51,400
Hello there, Mr. Traynor.

488
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:52,634
How are you doing today?

489
00:29:52,800 --> 00:29:54,280
Nathan, what are they doing in there?

490
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:56,676
He has a checkup every six months.

491
00:29:56,840 --> 00:29:58,398
To see if he's getting better?

492
00:29:58,920 --> 00:30:00,751
No, it's a spinal-cord injury.

493
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:03,856
He's not... He's not going to get better.

494
00:30:03,880 --> 00:30:06,519
But you do all those exercises with him.

495
00:30:06,920 --> 00:30:08,911
Yeah. That's to stop
his muscles atrophying.

496
00:30:10,680 --> 00:30:14,229
Will's body no longer works below here.

497
00:30:14,400 --> 00:30:16,550
Yeah, but he's still trying, right?

498
00:30:17,080 --> 00:30:19,435
He threw everything
into physio the first year,

499
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:23,275
and all he got from it was
slight movement in his thumb and finger.

500
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:26,910
Then the first bout of pneumonia hit,
then autonomic dysreflexia...

501
00:30:27,080 --> 00:30:28,559
What does that mean?

502
00:30:28,760 --> 00:30:30,352
Right. So his blood pressure

503
00:30:30,520 --> 00:30:31,560
- goes up and down.
- Yeah.

504
00:30:31,720 --> 00:30:33,233
He's constantly open to infection.

505
00:30:33,400 --> 00:30:36,710
But there's medical advances
taking place all the time. Right?

506
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:38,711
Well, yeah.

507
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:41,394
But no one's worked out
how to fix a spinal cord yet.

508
00:30:52,040 --> 00:30:53,951
Oh, I hear this one's good.

509
00:30:55,040 --> 00:30:57,235
Oh, because we suddenly speak Spanish?

510
00:30:57,400 --> 00:30:58,400
No, it's got subtitles.

511
00:30:58,560 --> 00:31:00,710
It gets so you don't notice after a while.

512
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:03,719
Two for the Will Ferrell, please.

513
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:31,640
Oh.

514
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:34,029
Is he okay?

515
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:36,595
He's not great. Bit of a chill.

516
00:31:36,760 --> 00:31:37,875
Where's Nathan?

517
00:31:38,080 --> 00:31:39,593
I've called him. He'll be here soon.

518
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:41,320
Look, Camilla's had to go up to London.

519
00:31:41,480 --> 00:31:42,680
Are you going to be all right?

520
00:31:43,560 --> 00:31:44,834
- Of course.
- Yeah?

521
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:46,069
Yeah.

522
00:31:48,360 --> 00:31:50,510
I'm on my mobile, if you need me.

523
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:51,835
Okay.

524
00:31:58,240 --> 00:31:59,832
Will, can I do anything?

525
00:32:00,800 --> 00:32:02,313
My pillows aren't right.

526
00:32:05,080 --> 00:32:06,308
Um, what do I do?

527
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:11,156
Put your hand under my head,
on my neck, and just lift gently.

528
00:32:11,360 --> 00:32:12,588
Okay.

529
00:32:17,680 --> 00:32:19,716
- Oh, Jesus.
- What have I done?

530
00:32:19,880 --> 00:32:21,677
Your hands are freezing.

531
00:32:29,520 --> 00:32:30,748
Better.

532
00:32:32,920 --> 00:32:35,195
Can I get you some painkillers?

533
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:38,630
- Yeah? Okay.
- Thank you.

534
00:32:57,720 --> 00:32:58,914
Will.

535
00:33:02,600 --> 00:33:03,749
Will?

536
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:08,918
Will? It's...

537
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:11,755
It's Lou.

538
00:33:14,440 --> 00:33:15,668
I know.

539
00:33:17,840 --> 00:33:19,600
Is there something
I should be doing?

540
00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:20,909
Some drugs or something?

541
00:33:21,080 --> 00:33:22,911
I'm just getting really worried.

542
00:33:34,400 --> 00:33:35,816
Hello. This is Stephen.

543
00:33:35,840 --> 00:33:39,515
Please leave your name and number,
and I'll call you back.

544
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:41,912
Hi, Mr. Traynor. It's Lou. I'm just...

545
00:33:42,120 --> 00:33:43,553
I'm getting concerned about Will

546
00:33:43,720 --> 00:33:46,029
and I was wondering if
you could just call me back.

547
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:47,838
Okay. Thanks. Bye.

548
00:33:55,240 --> 00:33:56,798
G'day. This is Nathan.

549
00:33:56,960 --> 00:33:59,076
Leave a message and I'll call you back.

550
00:34:00,760 --> 00:34:01,795
Don't ring Mum.

551
00:34:01,960 --> 00:34:02,960
What?

552
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:05,510
We'll be fine, Clark.

553
00:34:16,520 --> 00:34:17,520
Oi!

554
00:34:18,200 --> 00:34:19,997
Sorry. Had to walk here.

555
00:34:20,200 --> 00:34:21,800
Took ages, the bloody weather, you know.

556
00:34:21,920 --> 00:34:22,920
How's things?

557
00:34:23,120 --> 00:34:25,280
Not great. He's in and out
and he's not drunk anything.

558
00:34:25,320 --> 00:34:26,456
How long's he been like this?

559
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:27,674
Maybe four or five hours.

560
00:34:27,840 --> 00:34:29,496
I tried to call.
I did give him painkillers.

561
00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:30,856
Might as well have given him M&Ms.

562
00:34:30,880 --> 00:34:32,400
Well, he said he just wanted to sleep.

563
00:34:32,520 --> 00:34:33,953
Yeah, it's in the folder, Lou.

564
00:34:34,120 --> 00:34:35,872
Will doesn't sweat the way we do.

565
00:34:36,040 --> 00:34:38,440
If he gets even a slight chill,
his temperature goes haywire.

566
00:34:38,520 --> 00:34:40,216
- Yeah, but he said...
- Just go and get us a fan

567
00:34:40,240 --> 00:34:42,800
- and a damp towel, real quick.
- Okay.

568
00:34:44,200 --> 00:34:45,792
Hey, buddy. You all right?

569
00:34:45,960 --> 00:34:48,076
Will? You all right?

570
00:34:48,840 --> 00:34:50,068
I got you, mate. Come on.

571
00:34:50,240 --> 00:34:51,559
Come on. Yeah.

572
00:34:51,720 --> 00:34:52,835
Here.

573
00:34:56,120 --> 00:34:58,076
Hey, focus. Lou, you gotta
watch what I'm doing.

574
00:34:58,280 --> 00:35:00,316
- Sorry.
- That's right.

575
00:35:01,160 --> 00:35:02,991
He's going to be okay.

576
00:36:05,840 --> 00:36:07,136
There are very few people out there

577
00:36:07,160 --> 00:36:09,355
who can claim to have
out-Bonded James Bond.

578
00:36:09,560 --> 00:36:13,519
But birthday boy "Wild Willy" Will Traynor
is certainly one of them.

579
00:36:13,680 --> 00:36:15,557
So, Will, any final thoughts, bro?

580
00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:17,398
I'm thinking you should be next, mate.

581
00:36:17,560 --> 00:36:18,834
Yeah, right!

582
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:23,056
We're all thinking it.

583
00:36:23,080 --> 00:36:25,435
Is there really nothing he can't do?

584
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:27,989
- Do we hate him? Yes.
- We do!

585
00:36:28,200 --> 00:36:31,431
But there's no point
in dwelling on that on his birthday.

586
00:36:31,600 --> 00:36:33,955
Thank God he's not good-looking.

587
00:36:37,040 --> 00:36:38,234
Ah, stop!

588
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:41,597
You're watching
French gay porn, I hope.

589
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:45,554
Wi-Fi connection's not strong enough.

590
00:36:46,080 --> 00:36:47,752
What time is it?

591
00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:49,273
Where's... Where's Nathan?

592
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:51,590
Half eight. He had to
go to another patient.

593
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:54,677
Snow got pretty bad.

594
00:36:57,400 --> 00:36:59,630
Shouldn't you be at home?

595
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:02,871
You're stuck with me.

596
00:37:10,600 --> 00:37:12,636
Will, can I ask you something?

597
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:14,597
I suspect you're going to.

598
00:37:15,600 --> 00:37:16,635
What happened?

599
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:19,633
My mother didn't tell you?
It's her favorite story.

600
00:37:19,840 --> 00:37:20,976
Some sort of traffic accident...

601
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:23,434
- Motorbike.
- You were riding a motorbike?

602
00:37:23,600 --> 00:37:25,477
Actually, I wasn't.

603
00:37:27,400 --> 00:37:29,311
The bike hit me.

604
00:37:30,760 --> 00:37:33,718
Sorry. Sorry, I'm being chatty again,

605
00:37:33,880 --> 00:37:36,792
and you need to rest.

606
00:37:37,880 --> 00:37:38,880
No.

607
00:37:39,040 --> 00:37:40,553
Stay.

608
00:37:41,400 --> 00:37:42,400
Tell me...

609
00:37:42,920 --> 00:37:44,069
Tell me something good.

610
00:37:44,280 --> 00:37:46,475
I used to say that to my dad.

611
00:37:46,640 --> 00:37:49,359
But if I told you what he said back,
you'd think I was insane.

612
00:37:49,520 --> 00:37:51,511
Oh, that ship has sailed, Clark.

613
00:37:52,160 --> 00:37:54,435
When I had a nightmare or
something he used to sing.

614
00:37:54,600 --> 00:37:55,600
Go on.

615
00:37:55,760 --> 00:37:57,990
He used to sing the Molahonkey song.

616
00:37:58,160 --> 00:38:00,310
- The what?
- The Molahonkey song.

617
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:01,560
I thought everyone knew it.

618
00:38:01,720 --> 00:38:04,792
Trust me, Clark. I'm a Molahonkey virgin.

619
00:38:04,960 --> 00:38:06,871
You're gonna make me sing it now?

620
00:38:28,200 --> 00:38:29,918
You're insane.

621
00:38:30,120 --> 00:38:31,758
Your whole family is insane.

622
00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:33,239
And you're a God-awful singer.

623
00:38:33,400 --> 00:38:35,152
I hope your dad was better.

624
00:38:35,320 --> 00:38:36,496
I think what you mean to say is,

625
00:38:36,520 --> 00:38:38,720
"Thank you, Miss Clark,
for attempting to entertain me."

626
00:38:39,360 --> 00:38:40,918
Okay, Clark.

627
00:38:41,680 --> 00:38:42,908
Tell me something else.

628
00:38:43,080 --> 00:38:44,640
Something that doesn't involve singing.

629
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:45,835
About what?

630
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:47,194
Anything.

631
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:49,149
Well...

632
00:38:50,040 --> 00:38:52,634
When I was little,

633
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:56,110
my mum got me a pair of glittery wellies,

634
00:38:56,280 --> 00:38:58,919
and I refused to take them off.

635
00:38:59,080 --> 00:39:03,392
I wore them in bed, in the bath,
all summer long.

636
00:39:03,560 --> 00:39:05,994
My favorite outfit

637
00:39:06,160 --> 00:39:08,799
was the glittery boots
and my bumblebee tights.

638
00:39:08,960 --> 00:39:10,234
Bumblebee tights?

639
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:12,470
- Black and yellow stripes.
- Oh, dear God.

640
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:15,837
I just... I really, really, really
liked having stripy legs.

641
00:39:16,040 --> 00:39:18,998
So what happened to these gorgeous wellies
and stripy tights?

642
00:39:19,160 --> 00:39:20,912
Ah! I outgrew them.

643
00:39:21,080 --> 00:39:22,354
It broke my heart.

644
00:39:22,520 --> 00:39:23,896
And they don't make those tights anymore.

645
00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:25,353
Not for grown women, anyway.

646
00:39:25,520 --> 00:39:26,669
Strange, that.

647
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:29,599
Oh, you can mock. Didn't you
ever love anything that much?

648
00:39:31,800 --> 00:39:33,233
Yes.

649
00:39:34,200 --> 00:39:35,713
Yes, I did.

650
00:40:16,680 --> 00:40:18,160
Interesting choice of footwear.

651
00:40:19,680 --> 00:40:22,638
Patrick says they make me look
like a leprechaun drag queen.

652
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:23,949
He was being nice.

653
00:40:24,600 --> 00:40:27,160
- Don't smile at me like that.
- Why not?

654
00:40:27,360 --> 00:40:28,998
Because I don't know what it means.

655
00:40:29,400 --> 00:40:31,470
Where did you pick up your exotic tastes?

656
00:40:31,640 --> 00:40:33,696
- What do you mean by that?
- It can't be from around here.

657
00:40:33,720 --> 00:40:34,720
Why not?

658
00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:36,216
Because this is the kind of
place people come to

659
00:40:36,240 --> 00:40:38,435
when they've got tired of actually living.

660
00:40:38,600 --> 00:40:40,397
People here think excitement is a new

661
00:40:40,560 --> 00:40:42,630
"Please be quiet" sign
going up in the library.

662
00:40:43,960 --> 00:40:46,520
You should be out there,
claiming the world as your own.

663
00:40:46,680 --> 00:40:48,671
Showing your leprechaun shoes
to dodgy men.

664
00:40:48,880 --> 00:40:51,189
- I like my life.
- You like everything.

665
00:40:51,360 --> 00:40:53,078
- I'm happy here.
- Well, you shouldn't be.

666
00:40:53,240 --> 00:40:55,754
Oh, you want me to be more
like the girls you know, do you?

667
00:40:55,920 --> 00:40:58,718
Go to London, marry somebody like Rupert.

668
00:40:58,880 --> 00:41:00,154
I believe he's taken.

669
00:41:00,320 --> 00:41:02,216
And ignore the fact that
he's shagging his secretary

670
00:41:02,240 --> 00:41:03,514
within five years.

671
00:41:03,680 --> 00:41:05,200
And bitch about him at dinner parties,

672
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:07,561
knowing he won't leave because
he's scared of the alimony.

673
00:41:07,640 --> 00:41:09,551
And have sex once every six weeks,

674
00:41:09,720 --> 00:41:12,871
and listen to him going on and on about
how much he adores the children,

675
00:41:13,040 --> 00:41:15,429
while doing nothing
to actually take care of them.

676
00:41:15,600 --> 00:41:17,192
And have perfect hair,

677
00:41:17,360 --> 00:41:18,839
but get this kind of pinched face

678
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:21,150
through never saying
what you actually mean.

679
00:41:21,320 --> 00:41:24,790
And develop an insane Pilates habit,
and buy a dog, or a horse,

680
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:26,696
and develop a crush
on your riding instructor.

681
00:41:26,720 --> 00:41:29,871
And watch your husband take up
jogging when he hits 40

682
00:41:30,040 --> 00:41:31,040
and buy a Harley.

683
00:41:31,200 --> 00:41:33,998
And know that every day,
he goes into the office

684
00:41:34,160 --> 00:41:38,233
and looks at the young men,
and feels like, somehow, he got suckered!

685
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:42,518
And leave him anyway, and come back here
to give the children a happy childhood.

686
00:41:42,880 --> 00:41:43,880
Whoa!

687
00:41:44,080 --> 00:41:46,878
There were a lot of divorce
handovers at the café.

688
00:41:47,040 --> 00:41:48,040
Sorry.

689
00:41:48,200 --> 00:41:49,838
How did you end up in that café?

690
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:53,470
Treena made a bet
that I couldn't get a job in 24 hours.

691
00:41:53,640 --> 00:41:55,471
I proved her wrong.

692
00:41:55,640 --> 00:41:57,358
And stayed there six years. Way to go!

693
00:41:57,520 --> 00:41:58,953
I was supposed to leave.

694
00:41:59,160 --> 00:42:01,116
I had a place at Manchester.

695
00:42:01,280 --> 00:42:02,508
What were you going to study?

696
00:42:03,080 --> 00:42:04,308
Fashion.

697
00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:06,789
Mmm. So, why didn't you go?

698
00:42:10,920 --> 00:42:12,456
You know what I see when I look at you?

699
00:42:12,480 --> 00:42:15,074
- Don't say "potential."
- Potential.

700
00:42:15,800 --> 00:42:18,155
You need to widen your horizons, Clark.

701
00:42:18,320 --> 00:42:19,912
You only get one life.

702
00:42:20,080 --> 00:42:23,117
It's actually your duty
to live it as fully as possible.

703
00:42:24,240 --> 00:42:26,754
Well, you need a shave!

704
00:42:26,920 --> 00:42:29,559
If that beard gets any longer,
I'll be picking food out of it.

705
00:42:29,720 --> 00:42:32,917
And then I'll have to sue you
for undue distress in the workplace.

706
00:42:33,080 --> 00:42:34,798
- You're changing the subject.
- Yes.

707
00:42:34,960 --> 00:42:36,632
I am.

708
00:42:36,800 --> 00:42:37,869
Fine.

709
00:42:39,720 --> 00:42:41,199
I'll let you.

710
00:42:44,960 --> 00:42:46,951
You're really going to do this?

711
00:42:47,880 --> 00:42:48,995
I'm, uh...

712
00:42:49,160 --> 00:42:50,639
I'm really gonna do this.

713
00:42:50,800 --> 00:42:52,631
My mother's gonna be so happy.

714
00:42:52,840 --> 00:42:53,840
Yes, well,

715
00:42:54,480 --> 00:42:57,074
we won't let that put us off.

716
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:39,309
You've got a funny look on your face.

717
00:43:39,480 --> 00:43:42,677
Please don't tell me
you shaved off my eyebrows.

718
00:43:42,840 --> 00:43:44,478
Only the one.

719
00:43:49,520 --> 00:43:51,795
Freedom? You call this freedom?

720
00:43:51,960 --> 00:43:53,234
We all agreed to it.

721
00:43:53,440 --> 00:43:55,396
Not the specifics. Jesus!

722
00:43:55,560 --> 00:43:57,200
If I hadn't noticed the Swiss postmark...

723
00:43:57,320 --> 00:43:59,311
We made an agreement with Will.

724
00:43:59,480 --> 00:44:00,799
Six months.

725
00:44:00,960 --> 00:44:03,394
No. I only agreed
so that we had six months

726
00:44:03,560 --> 00:44:04,788
to change his mind.

727
00:44:04,960 --> 00:44:08,748
I cannot believe that you are willing
to help our son end his life!

728
00:44:08,920 --> 00:44:12,913
I'd rather that than
risk him trying again, alone.

729
00:44:13,080 --> 00:44:14,957
It wasn't a cry for help, Camilla.

730
00:44:15,120 --> 00:44:16,917
He meant it. You know that.

731
00:44:17,080 --> 00:44:21,358
Now, this way we can be with him,
supporting him, loving him.

732
00:44:21,520 --> 00:44:24,080
- He's my son!
- Yes, he's my son, too!

733
00:44:25,440 --> 00:44:28,716
It's his choice. This is what he wants.

734
00:44:28,880 --> 00:44:31,075
You know how much pain he's in.

735
00:44:44,960 --> 00:44:47,155
He gave me six months.

736
00:44:47,680 --> 00:44:49,318
We can still persuade him.

737
00:44:51,240 --> 00:44:53,993
And you think the pretty waitress
is going to do that.

738
00:44:59,600 --> 00:45:03,036
Now, can I have the letter, please?

739
00:45:05,520 --> 00:45:06,839
Please.

740
00:45:21,120 --> 00:45:23,475
Apparently, the shave was your idea.

741
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:26,798
Nice one! It looks great.

742
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:35,309
Now,
Arsenal, four. Liverpool, one.

743
00:45:35,480 --> 00:45:36,480
Bye.

744
00:45:52,240 --> 00:45:53,753
I need you.

745
00:45:55,200 --> 00:45:58,636
I know we need the money,
but this is horrible.

746
00:45:58,800 --> 00:46:01,314
I'm basically just on suicide watch.

747
00:46:01,480 --> 00:46:03,152
I am not going back.

748
00:46:03,360 --> 00:46:05,351
- Yeah.
- What?

749
00:46:05,840 --> 00:46:07,478
Come on. Say it.

750
00:46:09,280 --> 00:46:11,236
I was thinking about him.

751
00:46:12,360 --> 00:46:13,998
Lou, you can't leave him.

752
00:46:15,720 --> 00:46:16,789
They've got money, right?

753
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:18,000
I don't want their money!

754
00:46:18,160 --> 00:46:19,991
No, not for you, idiot-girl!

755
00:46:20,160 --> 00:46:21,309
Look.

756
00:46:21,480 --> 00:46:24,199
If this is what he really wants,

757
00:46:24,680 --> 00:46:26,318
then use the time he's got left.

758
00:46:26,480 --> 00:46:28,118
Make it special.

759
00:46:29,640 --> 00:46:33,269
Ask the Traynors for a budget
and go crazy.

760
00:46:33,440 --> 00:46:36,750
Organize, I don't know,
swimming with dolphins, sky-diving.

761
00:46:36,920 --> 00:46:38,672
A nice, sexy lap dance.

762
00:46:38,840 --> 00:46:40,200
City boys always like a lap dance.

763
00:46:40,400 --> 00:46:41,799
Katrina Clark!

764
00:46:41,960 --> 00:46:43,393
A bucket list.

765
00:46:43,920 --> 00:46:46,150
Show him how good this time can be.

766
00:46:46,360 --> 00:46:49,397
Take him places. Make him laugh.

767
00:46:50,800 --> 00:46:52,233
Bloody hell.

768
00:46:53,960 --> 00:46:57,999
But, Treen, what if that list
could do more than that?

769
00:46:58,160 --> 00:47:01,072
What if it could make him change his mind?

770
00:47:39,040 --> 00:47:40,936
Will's barely left
the house in two years.

771
00:47:40,960 --> 00:47:41,995
We have tried.

772
00:47:42,200 --> 00:47:45,112
Yes, but we haven't succeeded.
If Louisa can come up with things

773
00:47:45,280 --> 00:47:46,952
that Will is able and prepared to do,

774
00:47:47,120 --> 00:47:49,031
then that's all for the good, surely.

775
00:47:49,480 --> 00:47:51,869
Sports, concerts.

776
00:47:52,040 --> 00:47:53,871
I'd love to see him
do any of these things.

777
00:47:54,040 --> 00:47:55,473
Okay. Okay.

778
00:47:55,680 --> 00:47:57,160
Louisa, if you can get me a schedule,

779
00:47:57,320 --> 00:47:59,136
I'll see if I can shift things
around in my diary.

780
00:47:59,160 --> 00:48:00,479
No!

781
00:48:00,640 --> 00:48:02,278
Let him do it for himself.

782
00:48:02,480 --> 00:48:05,790
Will needs to be allowed
to feel like a man.

783
00:48:36,640 --> 00:48:38,073
There you go.

784
00:48:41,560 --> 00:48:43,152
Oh, my God!

785
00:48:43,320 --> 00:48:44,639
What have you come as?

786
00:48:44,800 --> 00:48:45,994
I don't care what you think.

787
00:48:46,160 --> 00:48:48,310
Even if you have got a new haircut.

788
00:48:48,480 --> 00:48:49,959
You look like a madwoman.

789
00:48:50,120 --> 00:48:51,951
An oddly cheerful madwoman.

790
00:48:52,120 --> 00:48:55,351
We're taking Nathan
to see the horse racing.

791
00:48:55,680 --> 00:48:56,680
Horse racing?

792
00:48:56,840 --> 00:48:58,239
Yeah. Nathan's never been.

793
00:48:59,200 --> 00:49:00,679
Yeah. It's true.

794
00:49:00,840 --> 00:49:04,355
And, besides, I've got
five pounds on Man-Oh-Man

795
00:49:04,520 --> 00:49:05,999
at eight to one.

796
00:49:06,160 --> 00:49:08,515
My dad's mate, Jimmy,
says he's a sure thing.

797
00:49:08,680 --> 00:49:09,829
Just a wild guess,

798
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:11,216
but you haven't been
racing before, either,

799
00:49:11,240 --> 00:49:12,355
have you, Clark?

800
00:49:15,520 --> 00:49:17,317
The perfect spot.

801
00:49:17,960 --> 00:49:20,155
Look, we're so lucky.

802
00:49:20,320 --> 00:49:22,356
Are you sure? This is too soft,
he's going to sink.

803
00:49:22,560 --> 00:49:24,416
Oh, no. He'll be fine.
It's gonna be great.

804
00:49:24,440 --> 00:49:26,317
Right. That's all right.

805
00:49:26,520 --> 00:49:27,635
Yeah?

806
00:49:29,240 --> 00:49:30,400
- Ah... Um...
- You all right?

807
00:49:31,400 --> 00:49:33,520
- What, do we need to?
- Look, you pull and I'll push.

808
00:49:34,040 --> 00:49:35,439
Okay.

809
00:49:37,360 --> 00:49:38,509
Oh! Shit. Um...

810
00:49:38,920 --> 00:49:41,229
Don't worry. It's only cashmere.

811
00:49:41,400 --> 00:49:42,400
Yeah. He's stuck

812
00:49:42,560 --> 00:49:44,176
I know, it's going to be fine.
It's gonna be fine.

813
00:49:44,200 --> 00:49:46,634
- Oh, excuse me! Hi!
- You okay?

814
00:49:46,800 --> 00:49:48,392
- Hi. Sorry. Do you...
- Clark.

815
00:49:48,560 --> 00:49:50,357
Would you be able to help us?
With the, um...

816
00:49:50,520 --> 00:49:51,696
- Because we're a bit stuck.
- We're fine.

817
00:49:51,720 --> 00:49:53,216
- We're fine. We're fine.
- No, we're fine.

818
00:49:53,240 --> 00:49:54,560
Yeah? Would that be... Very kind.

819
00:49:54,720 --> 00:49:55,976
Come on, Will.

820
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:58,434
You okay? Yeah! You're okay, aren't you?

821
00:49:58,640 --> 00:50:00,073
There we go. There we go.

822
00:50:00,240 --> 00:50:01,798
Brilliant! Thank you so much.

823
00:50:01,960 --> 00:50:03,336
- Thank you. Thanks.
- Thanks, boys. Thanks, fellas.

824
00:50:03,360 --> 00:50:04,360
No worries!

825
00:50:04,560 --> 00:50:06,755
Guys, we're here!
It's gonna be fun!

826
00:50:09,080 --> 00:50:10,798
Just a quick recap now...

827
00:50:10,960 --> 00:50:12,359
Look, look, look. There he is.

828
00:50:12,520 --> 00:50:15,751
Don't you think he looks like
a sure thing, huh?

829
00:50:15,920 --> 00:50:16,920
Will?

830
00:50:17,080 --> 00:50:18,513
You're going to lose.

831
00:50:18,680 --> 00:50:19,874
How would you know that?

832
00:50:20,040 --> 00:50:23,794
His ears are flat, his coat is dull,
and he's got a funny walk.

833
00:50:23,960 --> 00:50:24,995
Great.

834
00:50:25,160 --> 00:50:27,040
So, you know everything
about horse racing, too.

835
00:50:27,160 --> 00:50:28,160
No.

836
00:50:28,320 --> 00:50:31,756
I just look, process information
and make decisions.

837
00:50:32,560 --> 00:50:34,790
And that horse is
definitely not gonna win.

838
00:50:35,040 --> 00:50:36,393
Yeah, well, I like him.

839
00:50:36,560 --> 00:50:38,869
Sometimes you just have to
go with your gut.

840
00:50:39,040 --> 00:50:41,349
I'm gonna go and place my bet.

841
00:50:46,560 --> 00:50:48,949
They're lining up
at the gate now.

842
00:50:49,120 --> 00:50:51,111
Good to see My Blue Heaven
back after injury.

843
00:50:51,280 --> 00:50:53,316
State of Grace always
a bit reluctant going in.

844
00:50:53,760 --> 00:50:55,273
They're under starter's orders.

845
00:50:55,440 --> 00:50:56,440
And they're off!

846
00:50:56,600 --> 00:50:59,512
Greek God setting a good pace
on the inside with Little Jim ju... Oh!

847
00:50:59,680 --> 00:51:00,880
We seem to have a non-starter.

848
00:51:01,040 --> 00:51:03,270
Man-Oh-Man apparently having a day off.

849
00:51:03,440 --> 00:51:06,398
No, Aiden O 'Connor looks like
he's just not going to get him going.

850
00:51:06,560 --> 00:51:08,456
Well, the rest of the field
are now making their way

851
00:51:08,480 --> 00:51:10,000
along the straight at a cracking pace.

852
00:51:12,560 --> 00:51:14,073
This is nice.

853
00:51:14,240 --> 00:51:16,151
Yeah, I love being spoon-fed in public.

854
00:51:16,320 --> 00:51:18,629
Hello! We'd like
a table for three, please.

855
00:51:18,840 --> 00:51:20,520
Of course. If I could just see your badge.

856
00:51:20,720 --> 00:51:21,720
Sorry?

857
00:51:21,880 --> 00:51:23,600
This restaurant's for
Premier Badge holders.

858
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:26,958
Oh, well, we've got the pink badges!

859
00:51:27,120 --> 00:51:29,953
I'm sorry, we can only serve
Premier Badge holders.

860
00:51:30,560 --> 00:51:33,120
Um, okay, are there any other restaurants?

861
00:51:33,280 --> 00:51:35,794
Well, there's our relaxed dining area,

862
00:51:36,440 --> 00:51:38,351
and there are stalls outside.

863
00:51:38,520 --> 00:51:41,398
The Pig in a Poke does
a nice hog roast in a bun

864
00:51:41,560 --> 00:51:42,754
with apple sauce.

865
00:51:43,560 --> 00:51:46,552
Sharon. Can I call you Sharon? Yeah?

866
00:51:46,720 --> 00:51:51,032
So it's a quiet Monday afternoon
and you've got a lot of empty tables.

867
00:51:51,200 --> 00:51:54,317
We want to buy a really expensive meal.

868
00:51:54,480 --> 00:51:56,357
We don't want to
eat pork rolls at a stall,

869
00:51:56,520 --> 00:51:58,397
even with apple sauce.

870
00:51:58,560 --> 00:51:59,560
Oh, I'm really sorry.

871
00:51:59,760 --> 00:52:01,591
You need a Premier Area Badge.
It's policy.

872
00:52:01,800 --> 00:52:05,475
Okay, okay, okay. So how much
for a Premier Area Badge?

873
00:52:05,680 --> 00:52:07,680
What are we talking, like,
another 10? Another 20?

874
00:52:07,840 --> 00:52:09,831
We don't sell badges, madam.

875
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:11,353
This is a restaurant.

876
00:52:11,560 --> 00:52:13,676
You'll have to go to the ticket office.

877
00:52:13,840 --> 00:52:15,876
Louisa. Let's go.

878
00:52:16,040 --> 00:52:17,216
No, no, no. This is nuts.

879
00:52:17,240 --> 00:52:18,593
We've come all this way.

880
00:52:18,760 --> 00:52:19,829
Louisa.

881
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:21,194
I'm not hungry.

882
00:52:21,360 --> 00:52:23,874
I'm just gonna run
and get the badges,

883
00:52:24,040 --> 00:52:25,837
and then we will have our meal.

884
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:28,036
We'll be fine once we've eaten. Yeah.

885
00:52:28,200 --> 00:52:29,394
Lou.

886
00:52:29,560 --> 00:52:31,755
I think Will wants to go home.

887
00:52:37,320 --> 00:52:38,912
You know what, Sharon?

888
00:52:39,920 --> 00:52:44,391
You can stick your Premier Badge
right up your relaxed dining area.

889
00:52:46,320 --> 00:52:47,320
Okay. Okay.

890
00:52:47,480 --> 00:52:49,072
Everything's fine.

891
00:53:05,320 --> 00:53:07,096
Great. So we're going to
paralyze your eardrums

892
00:53:07,120 --> 00:53:08,758
as well, now, are we?

893
00:53:14,240 --> 00:53:17,630
So, maybe horse racing
wasn't my best idea.

894
00:53:21,240 --> 00:53:24,596
But this, I think you'll enjoy.

895
00:53:24,800 --> 00:53:27,519
So Nathan's never been to
a classical music concert now?

896
00:53:27,720 --> 00:53:28,755
No. I haven't.

897
00:53:30,800 --> 00:53:32,916
Will you please come with me?

898
00:53:33,920 --> 00:53:35,478
I bought the tickets a week ago.

899
00:53:36,040 --> 00:53:37,439
You can say "no."

900
00:53:37,600 --> 00:53:39,318
A wind concerto?

901
00:53:39,480 --> 00:53:41,710
I've been assured
it doesn't involve farting.

902
00:53:43,520 --> 00:53:44,794
There's no chance of Jay-Z?

903
00:53:44,960 --> 00:53:48,589
Sadly, his tickets had just sold out.

904
00:53:51,200 --> 00:53:52,792
Mozart it is, then.

905
00:53:59,080 --> 00:54:01,514
Okay. Would this

906
00:54:01,680 --> 00:54:04,274
be the right sort of thing
to wear to a concert?

907
00:54:04,440 --> 00:54:06,590
Metallica, no.

908
00:54:06,800 --> 00:54:08,472
Neil Diamond, possibly.

909
00:54:08,680 --> 00:54:10,080
I thought Pat was training tonight.

910
00:54:10,200 --> 00:54:11,200
Oh, no. He is.

911
00:54:11,360 --> 00:54:14,557
He is. I'm taking Will to a concert thing.

912
00:54:14,720 --> 00:54:16,438
Sorry, you're going on a date?

913
00:54:16,600 --> 00:54:18,033
It's too booby.

914
00:54:18,200 --> 00:54:19,349
Way too booby.

915
00:54:19,520 --> 00:54:21,920
Given it's a man for whom your
boobs are mostly at eye-level.

916
00:54:22,480 --> 00:54:24,789
Oh, you're so annoying!

917
00:54:24,960 --> 00:54:27,872
You are so going on a date
with Will Traynor.

918
00:54:28,560 --> 00:54:29,675
Get the red dress out.

919
00:54:29,840 --> 00:54:31,273
Really?

920
00:54:34,040 --> 00:54:35,598
Kapow!

921
00:54:43,720 --> 00:54:45,119
Lose the scarf.

922
00:54:45,280 --> 00:54:46,474
The scarf? Why?

923
00:54:46,640 --> 00:54:48,995
If you're going to wear
a dress like that, Clark,

924
00:54:49,160 --> 00:54:50,878
you have to wear it with confidence.

925
00:54:51,040 --> 00:54:52,871
Only you, Will Traynor,

926
00:54:53,040 --> 00:54:56,032
would tell a woman
how to wear a bloody dress.

927
00:55:08,040 --> 00:55:09,189
- Here?
- Mmm-hmm.

928
00:55:13,240 --> 00:55:15,390
- Am I good?
- Yeah! Yeah.

929
00:55:17,080 --> 00:55:19,150
Yep, yep, yep. Yep.

930
00:55:19,720 --> 00:55:21,472
- Okay.
- Okay.

931
00:55:27,720 --> 00:55:29,039
Is everything okay?

932
00:55:29,320 --> 00:55:30,320
Mmm-hmm.

933
00:55:31,440 --> 00:55:33,829
Actually, no, there's something
digging into my collar.

934
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:35,319
Okay.

935
00:55:38,840 --> 00:55:40,159
It's a tag.

936
00:55:40,320 --> 00:55:42,436
Have we got any scissors in the bag?

937
00:55:42,600 --> 00:55:43,669
I don't know, Clark.

938
00:55:43,840 --> 00:55:45,520
Believe it or not,
I rarely pack it myself.

939
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:47,638
Um... Okay, hang on.

940
00:55:51,680 --> 00:55:53,796
Got it!

941
00:55:53,960 --> 00:55:56,080
We should just be grateful
it wasn't in your trousers.

942
00:55:56,200 --> 00:55:58,236
Oh, look. They're starting.

943
00:56:43,320 --> 00:56:45,470
So you're not a classical
music person, then?

944
00:56:45,640 --> 00:56:46,675
Hated every minute.

945
00:56:46,880 --> 00:56:48,279
Yeah, I could tell.

946
00:56:48,840 --> 00:56:50,478
Especially during that oboe solo.

947
00:56:50,640 --> 00:56:52,596
There was something in my eye.

948
00:56:54,320 --> 00:56:55,548
I loved it.

949
00:56:56,600 --> 00:56:58,192
Did you?

950
00:57:00,160 --> 00:57:01,309
Yeah.

951
00:57:03,920 --> 00:57:05,120
Right, we'd better get you in.

952
00:57:05,200 --> 00:57:06,269
Wait a minute, Clark.

953
00:57:06,480 --> 00:57:07,674
You okay?

954
00:57:07,840 --> 00:57:09,114
I don't...

955
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:11,956
I don't want to go in yet.

956
00:57:14,840 --> 00:57:16,831
I just want to be a man
who has been to a concert

957
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:18,831
with a girl in a red dress.

958
00:57:22,240 --> 00:57:24,356
Just a few minutes more.

959
00:57:56,560 --> 00:58:00,155
So, um...
Patrick wants to meet you.

960
00:58:01,120 --> 00:58:02,553
Running man? Why?

961
00:58:02,720 --> 00:58:05,792
I think he wants to know who I'm spending
all these late nights with.

962
00:58:06,280 --> 00:58:07,395
My parents do, too.

963
00:58:07,560 --> 00:58:10,438
I get nervous when a girl
asks me to meet her parents.

964
00:58:11,080 --> 00:58:14,755
They wanted me to invite you to
my birthday dinner next Thursday.

965
00:58:14,920 --> 00:58:16,831
But don't worry, I said
you wouldn't want to go.

966
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:18,000
Why?

967
00:58:18,160 --> 00:58:19,200
Because you hate strangers

968
00:58:19,320 --> 00:58:20,616
and you don't like eating
in front of people.

969
00:58:20,640 --> 00:58:22,596
Seemed pretty obvious.

970
00:58:23,600 --> 00:58:24,794
I'll come.

971
00:58:25,480 --> 00:58:26,595
If you want me to.

972
00:58:31,080 --> 00:58:33,275
Ah! Lads, welcome.

973
00:58:33,440 --> 00:58:34,839
Bernard Clark.

974
00:58:35,960 --> 00:58:37,440
Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't...

975
00:58:37,520 --> 00:58:39,397
A curtsy will be fine.

976
00:58:43,640 --> 00:58:45,596
Curtsy. Nice one.

977
00:58:45,760 --> 00:58:48,069
- This is Josie. My wife.
- Hello.

978
00:58:48,240 --> 00:58:50,549
- Come on in.
- Yeah! Come in, come in.

979
00:58:50,720 --> 00:58:52,073
Thank you.

980
00:58:52,520 --> 00:58:54,158
Listen, have fun.

981
00:58:54,880 --> 00:58:56,233
Thank you!

982
00:58:59,280 --> 00:59:00,349
Dear Lord,

983
00:59:00,520 --> 00:59:03,114
thank you for the food we eat,
and the company we keep.

984
00:59:03,280 --> 00:59:05,635
Thank you for the
opportunities you give us,

985
00:59:05,800 --> 00:59:09,315
and the strength to face the challenges
we meet on our journey.

986
00:59:10,520 --> 00:59:11,714
Amen.

987
00:59:11,880 --> 00:59:13,632
Amen.

988
00:59:17,800 --> 00:59:19,631
So, Will.

989
00:59:19,800 --> 00:59:21,870
You bought and sold companies?

990
00:59:22,480 --> 00:59:23,959
Something like that.

991
00:59:24,160 --> 00:59:27,197
Would you know this fella,
Alan Stonehouse?

992
00:59:27,360 --> 00:59:29,316
The one who...

993
00:59:29,480 --> 00:59:30,480
What is it?

994
00:59:30,640 --> 00:59:33,279
Asset stripped our firm?

995
00:59:33,440 --> 00:59:35,158
I'm afraid I trained him.

996
00:59:38,440 --> 00:59:39,953
Hmm.

997
00:59:40,240 --> 00:59:41,673
Oh, well...

998
00:59:41,840 --> 00:59:43,398
That's the door.

999
00:59:44,840 --> 00:59:45,875
Some chicken, love?

1000
00:59:50,200 --> 00:59:52,760
Six miles in 28 minutes.

1001
00:59:52,920 --> 00:59:55,514
And a happy birthday to my girlfriend!

1002
00:59:55,680 --> 00:59:56,999
Yes! Happy birthday!

1003
00:59:57,160 --> 00:59:59,151
- Sorry I'm a bit late.
- Oh, no!

1004
00:59:59,360 --> 01:00:01,999
Only 28 minutes.

1005
01:00:04,240 --> 01:00:05,753
So couldn't you go back to it, Will?

1006
01:00:05,920 --> 01:00:07,656
I mean, clearly you're
still sharp as a tack.

1007
01:00:07,680 --> 01:00:09,272
- Dad!
- No. It's fine.

1008
01:00:09,760 --> 01:00:10,760
Truth is,

1009
01:00:10,960 --> 01:00:13,076
I thought I could crack this
and then go back,

1010
01:00:13,240 --> 01:00:14,673
as if nothing had changed.

1011
01:00:14,880 --> 01:00:16,279
Uh, I was wrong.

1012
01:00:17,600 --> 01:00:19,272
This is delicious, Mrs. Clark.

1013
01:00:19,840 --> 01:00:21,239
Oh! Josie, please!

1014
01:00:21,400 --> 01:00:23,277
Well, we wanted to make today special.

1015
01:00:24,040 --> 01:00:25,632
Wish Treena could have been here.

1016
01:00:25,800 --> 01:00:27,358
She's the brains of the family.

1017
01:00:27,560 --> 01:00:29,869
She got put up two years at school,
didn't she, Bernard?

1018
01:00:30,040 --> 01:00:31,189
Overtook our Lou.

1019
01:00:31,360 --> 01:00:35,035
Not bright enough to stop herself
getting up the duff though.

1020
01:00:41,560 --> 01:00:44,233
Pat, shall I help you
to some more chicken?

1021
01:00:44,720 --> 01:00:47,075
So, Patrick, Louisa tells me
you're a personal trainer.

1022
01:00:47,960 --> 01:00:50,713
Um, life coaching,
physical training, motivation.

1023
01:00:50,880 --> 01:00:54,111
Local young entrepreneur of the year,
two years running.

1024
01:00:54,280 --> 01:00:55,776
Lou tells me you were
a bit of an action man before.

1025
01:00:55,800 --> 01:00:56,835
Pat.

1026
01:00:57,000 --> 01:00:59,275
I bet if we got you on
a really good fitness regime.

1027
01:00:59,440 --> 01:01:00,896
There's actually a Swedish study about

1028
01:01:00,920 --> 01:01:02,216
how you can train muscles to remember...

1029
01:01:02,240 --> 01:01:03,240
Patrick!

1030
01:01:03,840 --> 01:01:05,671
What? I'm just trying to...

1031
01:01:05,840 --> 01:01:07,831
Yeah, well, don't.

1032
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:10,309
I'll bear it in mind.

1033
01:01:10,520 --> 01:01:11,839
Thank you.

1034
01:01:34,520 --> 01:01:38,433
Um, so, I just wanted to say
we're very proud of you, love.

1035
01:01:38,600 --> 01:01:42,832
And, um... I don't know what we would
have done without you this past year.

1036
01:01:43,000 --> 01:01:44,399
Aw, Dad.

1037
01:01:45,160 --> 01:01:47,993
And, Will, thank you for employing her.

1038
01:01:48,160 --> 01:01:50,355
- Someone had to.
- Hey!

1039
01:01:51,240 --> 01:01:52,275
Pleasure's all mine.

1040
01:01:52,440 --> 01:01:53,555
Really.

1041
01:01:54,360 --> 01:01:55,759
- Oh!
- Here.

1042
01:01:55,920 --> 01:01:56,955
It's not much, but...

1043
01:01:57,120 --> 01:02:00,749
Granddad saw something on TV
about making your own presents.

1044
01:02:06,280 --> 01:02:07,280
Aw!

1045
01:02:07,480 --> 01:02:08,959
Granddad, thank you.

1046
01:02:09,160 --> 01:02:10,434
Thank you.

1047
01:02:16,320 --> 01:02:18,675
I love it. Mum, thank you.

1048
01:02:18,880 --> 01:02:20,518
Thank you.

1049
01:02:20,680 --> 01:02:22,033
Mine next.

1050
01:02:23,680 --> 01:02:25,159
Oh!

1051
01:02:26,880 --> 01:02:28,472
Go on, open it.

1052
01:02:32,680 --> 01:02:34,671
- I had it made specially.
- Oh...

1053
01:02:35,560 --> 01:02:37,516
Thank you, Patrick.

1054
01:02:37,840 --> 01:02:38,840
Oh!

1055
01:02:42,960 --> 01:02:43,960
Oh, wow.

1056
01:02:45,160 --> 01:02:47,276
There's something for you
in my bag as well.

1057
01:02:47,440 --> 01:02:50,273
You got Lou a present?
That's very kind of you.

1058
01:02:50,440 --> 01:02:51,839
Wasn't that kind, Bernard?

1059
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:53,513
That's very kind.

1060
01:02:56,360 --> 01:02:57,360
Okay.

1061
01:03:03,520 --> 01:03:04,520
Oh!

1062
01:03:04,800 --> 01:03:06,518
It's very lovely.

1063
01:03:09,480 --> 01:03:10,480
Oh!

1064
01:03:10,720 --> 01:03:13,280
Oh, my God! I don't believe it!

1065
01:03:13,440 --> 01:03:17,194
- What?
- But where did you get them?

1066
01:03:17,360 --> 01:03:18,554
It's a secret.

1067
01:03:18,720 --> 01:03:20,039
Tights?

1068
01:03:20,200 --> 01:03:22,191
Only the best pair of tights, ever!

1069
01:03:22,400 --> 01:03:23,799
Oh, I'm gonna go try them on.

1070
01:03:23,960 --> 01:03:25,871
I'm gonna go try them on!

1071
01:03:26,200 --> 01:03:27,599
Oh, um...

1072
01:03:27,880 --> 01:03:30,314
I can't tell you how much I love them.

1073
01:03:30,480 --> 01:03:32,710
Really! Thank you.

1074
01:03:39,320 --> 01:03:41,436
I put some cake in your bag.

1075
01:03:42,160 --> 01:03:43,991
Thank you, Josie.

1076
01:03:44,160 --> 01:03:45,559
It's good to meet you all.

1077
01:03:45,720 --> 01:03:48,029
And, Patrick, thank you for the

1078
01:03:49,240 --> 01:03:50,832
fitness advice.

1079
01:03:51,000 --> 01:03:54,072
Just helping my girlfriend
get the best out of her job.

1080
01:03:54,240 --> 01:03:55,593
Oh, you're a lucky man.

1081
01:03:55,760 --> 01:03:57,352
She certainly gives a good bed bath.

1082
01:04:04,160 --> 01:04:06,515
Funny guy. I like him.

1083
01:04:17,760 --> 01:04:20,957
So, I could take you
to a Shakespeare festival.

1084
01:04:21,120 --> 01:04:22,599
It's happening today and tomorrow.

1085
01:04:22,760 --> 01:04:24,478
Or there's a sculpture park
we could visit.

1086
01:04:24,640 --> 01:04:26,471
Or there's... Ooh, there's wine tasting.

1087
01:04:27,120 --> 01:04:28,439
This came.

1088
01:04:31,280 --> 01:04:32,315
Ah.

1089
01:04:35,360 --> 01:04:37,430
Can I take you somewhere?

1090
01:04:40,640 --> 01:04:43,632
First kiss I ever had
was on that rampart.

1091
01:04:43,800 --> 01:04:46,792
Probably didn't hurt
that you owned the castle.

1092
01:04:46,960 --> 01:04:48,473
Maybe I should have told her.

1093
01:04:48,640 --> 01:04:51,712
She dumped me a week later for a boy
who worked at the local shop.

1094
01:04:53,920 --> 01:04:57,469
You're never gonna fit through there.

1095
01:05:01,240 --> 01:05:03,151
Oh, wow. It's amazing!

1096
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:05,797
Will? Will! No, please!

1097
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:07,035
Will, stop!

1098
01:05:07,200 --> 01:05:08,633
Are you coming?

1099
01:05:10,640 --> 01:05:12,710
This is a very bad idea.

1100
01:05:13,520 --> 01:05:15,476
It's very dangerous.

1101
01:05:16,200 --> 01:05:18,236
It's very, very high up.

1102
01:05:22,200 --> 01:05:23,997
- And windy.
- Hmm.

1103
01:05:25,600 --> 01:05:27,909
When I was a kid, this used to
be my favorite place

1104
01:05:28,080 --> 01:05:29,354
in the whole world.

1105
01:05:29,520 --> 01:05:32,990
Did you walk around up here
pretending you were a warrior prince?

1106
01:05:33,160 --> 01:05:35,833
Even nicked a sword
from one of the exhibits.

1107
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:37,672
Weighed a ton.

1108
01:05:37,840 --> 01:05:40,912
I think this would still be
my favorite spot.

1109
01:05:41,120 --> 01:05:43,120
- That's because you haven't been anywhere.
- Oh...

1110
01:05:43,520 --> 01:05:45,636
So where's better than this, then?

1111
01:05:46,440 --> 01:05:47,440
Val d'Isère?

1112
01:05:49,200 --> 01:05:50,235
Paris.

1113
01:05:51,600 --> 01:05:54,831
Place Dauphine, right by the Pont Neuf.

1114
01:05:55,920 --> 01:05:58,514
Sitting outside a café
with a strong coffee

1115
01:05:58,720 --> 01:06:01,553
and a warm croissant
with unsalted butter and strawberry jam.

1116
01:06:01,720 --> 01:06:05,030
So, let's go! We could get on
the Eurostar right now.

1117
01:06:05,200 --> 01:06:06,633
- No.
- But you just said...

1118
01:06:06,800 --> 01:06:08,552
You don't get it, Clark.

1119
01:06:09,000 --> 01:06:11,150
I want to be in Paris as me.

1120
01:06:12,280 --> 01:06:14,157
The old me.

1121
01:06:14,360 --> 01:06:16,078
With pretty French girls
giving me the eye.

1122
01:06:16,400 --> 01:06:18,675
Could be something to look forward to.

1123
01:06:19,720 --> 01:06:21,312
If I shut my eyes now,

1124
01:06:21,480 --> 01:06:25,712
I know exactly how it feels
to be in that little square.

1125
01:06:26,640 --> 01:06:28,995
I remember every sensation.

1126
01:06:31,240 --> 01:06:35,711
I don't want those memories erased
by the struggle to fit behind a table,

1127
01:06:36,120 --> 01:06:38,918
the taxi drivers who refuse to take me,

1128
01:06:39,080 --> 01:06:42,390
and my wheelchair power pack
that won't charge in a French socket.

1129
01:06:48,760 --> 01:06:50,910
I'll tell you where we will go, though.

1130
01:06:51,080 --> 01:06:52,229
Where?

1131
01:06:52,960 --> 01:06:53,995
Alicia's wedding.

1132
01:06:54,160 --> 01:06:55,513
Really?

1133
01:06:58,480 --> 01:07:00,152
Will you come with me?

1134
01:07:00,320 --> 01:07:02,072
If you want me to.

1135
01:07:05,120 --> 01:07:06,712
Hello?

1136
01:07:07,280 --> 01:07:10,272
- Whoo! Jesus, Mum, hello!
- Too much?

1137
01:07:10,440 --> 01:07:11,589
Oh, sod it. I don't care.

1138
01:07:11,760 --> 01:07:13,955
We are celebrating, Lou.

1139
01:07:14,480 --> 01:07:16,596
- I've got a job!
- Oh!

1140
01:07:16,800 --> 01:07:18,119
Dad, that is fantastic!

1141
01:07:18,280 --> 01:07:21,909
You are looking at the new
Head of Maintenance at the castle.

1142
01:07:22,800 --> 01:07:24,836
- God, that's just...
- I know. I know.

1143
01:07:25,000 --> 01:07:27,195
Mr. Traynor rang me himself.

1144
01:07:27,360 --> 01:07:29,828
So I'm starting tomorrow
morning, month's trial.

1145
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:32,389
Isn't it brilliant? It's good money, Lou.

1146
01:07:32,560 --> 01:07:35,154
- And he gets his own van.
- Oh!

1147
01:07:35,360 --> 01:07:36,360
See you.

1148
01:07:36,520 --> 01:07:37,555
Okay.

1149
01:07:39,400 --> 01:07:41,470
I thought you'd be pleased.

1150
01:07:42,040 --> 01:07:43,792
No, I am! I am pleased.

1151
01:07:43,960 --> 01:07:46,030
I just... I don't know. I feel weird.

1152
01:07:46,200 --> 01:07:47,997
Well, don't.

1153
01:07:48,160 --> 01:07:50,628
Your dad needed a job,
mine needed a head of maintenance.

1154
01:07:50,800 --> 01:07:52,518
Yeah, but it's just the timing.

1155
01:07:52,680 --> 01:07:53,829
It's just a bit...

1156
01:07:54,000 --> 01:07:55,513
It's good.

1157
01:07:55,680 --> 01:07:57,636
Your dad will be great.

1158
01:07:57,840 --> 01:07:59,273
And it means...

1159
01:07:59,720 --> 01:08:01,153
It means what?

1160
01:08:01,320 --> 01:08:04,471
It means... It means that one day
you can go off and spread your wings

1161
01:08:04,680 --> 01:08:07,194
without worrying about everyone else.

1162
01:08:07,360 --> 01:08:09,669
Put yourself first, for once.

1163
01:08:18,120 --> 01:08:19,120
Hello.

1164
01:08:19,320 --> 01:08:21,675
Michael Lawler.
I'm here to see Mr. Traynor.

1165
01:08:21,840 --> 01:08:23,671
Oh, no, no, no. You've got the wrong door.

1166
01:08:23,840 --> 01:08:25,558
- He lives...
- It's okay, Clark.

1167
01:08:25,720 --> 01:08:27,039
How was traffic, Michael?

1168
01:08:27,200 --> 01:08:28,880
Oh, you know. Once you're out of London...

1169
01:08:29,040 --> 01:08:30,519
We'll sit in the courtyard.

1170
01:08:30,680 --> 01:08:32,750
You can leave us. Thanks, Clark.

1171
01:08:34,400 --> 01:08:36,038
How have you been?

1172
01:08:36,200 --> 01:08:37,679
Oh, well, thank you.

1173
01:09:00,800 --> 01:09:04,156
I thought he seemed happier.
He was smiling, laughing.

1174
01:09:04,320 --> 01:09:05,639
Me, too.

1175
01:09:06,600 --> 01:09:08,352
Well, thank you for telling me.

1176
01:09:13,600 --> 01:09:15,591
- Louisa.
- Yeah?

1177
01:09:15,760 --> 01:09:18,274
You will look after him
at the wedding, won't you?

1178
01:09:31,120 --> 01:09:33,156
I still don't know
why we're doing this.

1179
01:09:33,320 --> 01:09:34,840
We're going to behave admirably.

1180
01:09:34,920 --> 01:09:37,753
Just so you know,
if you do the My Left Foot thing,

1181
01:09:37,920 --> 01:09:41,435
I will drive home and leave you stuck here
with all your ex-girlfriends.

1182
01:09:41,600 --> 01:09:42,953
Spoilsport.

1183
01:10:23,960 --> 01:10:25,313
Ah!

1184
01:10:25,800 --> 01:10:27,472
Will, hi.

1185
01:10:27,640 --> 01:10:29,870
It's, uh... It's so good to see you again.

1186
01:10:30,040 --> 01:10:31,560
The office isn't the same without you.

1187
01:10:31,640 --> 01:10:33,921
One minute you were there
running everything and everyone,

1188
01:10:34,120 --> 01:10:36,475
and the next, well,
it's, uh, just not the same.

1189
01:10:36,640 --> 01:10:38,870
It's kind of you to say so, Freddie.

1190
01:10:39,080 --> 01:10:40,080
Ah, oh...

1191
01:10:40,320 --> 01:10:41,992
Louisa Clark, Freddie Foster.

1192
01:10:42,160 --> 01:10:43,912
Yes! Yes, I saw you at the church.

1193
01:10:44,360 --> 01:10:45,634
Life isn't all bad then, eh?

1194
01:10:45,840 --> 01:10:47,068
Will.I.Am.

1195
01:10:47,600 --> 01:10:48,999
Anyway, anyway, must mingle.

1196
01:10:49,160 --> 01:10:50,240
It's good to see you, Will.

1197
01:10:50,360 --> 01:10:52,396
And you, Miss Clark.

1198
01:10:54,320 --> 01:10:55,753
He's a nice guy.

1199
01:10:55,920 --> 01:10:56,920
He fancies you.

1200
01:10:57,080 --> 01:10:58,672
He needs glasses.

1201
01:10:58,840 --> 01:11:00,353
Don't do that.

1202
01:11:01,360 --> 01:11:02,588
You look beautiful.

1203
01:11:04,280 --> 01:11:06,316
Well, you don't look so shabby yourself.

1204
01:11:08,000 --> 01:11:09,877
Ladies and gentlemen.

1205
01:11:10,040 --> 01:11:15,068
I give you the bride and groom,
Mr. and Mrs. Rupert Collins!

1206
01:11:34,800 --> 01:11:35,949
Oh, God!

1207
01:11:36,120 --> 01:11:39,556
There ought to be a law
against Englishmen on dance floors.

1208
01:11:41,200 --> 01:11:42,235
Bride or groom?

1209
01:11:42,440 --> 01:11:43,873
Oh, neither.

1210
01:11:44,880 --> 01:11:45,915
You?

1211
01:11:46,560 --> 01:11:47,595
Godmother to the bride.

1212
01:11:47,760 --> 01:11:50,115
Which makes me morally
responsible for her.

1213
01:11:50,320 --> 01:11:51,878
Not one of my finer acts.

1214
01:11:52,040 --> 01:11:54,600
Oh, you don't think much of her, then?

1215
01:11:54,760 --> 01:11:56,159
This is a bit depressing.

1216
01:11:56,320 --> 01:11:57,320
Mmm.

1217
01:11:57,560 --> 01:11:59,120
Still, one can't do these things sober.

1218
01:12:00,160 --> 01:12:02,390
Oh, no, wait,
there's alcohol in this stuff?

1219
01:12:02,560 --> 01:12:04,551
Absolutely, darling.

1220
01:12:04,720 --> 01:12:07,518
And I firmly encourage you
to get as drunk as possible.

1221
01:12:08,240 --> 01:12:09,240
I hear rumors

1222
01:12:09,400 --> 01:12:10,549
that the father of the bride

1223
01:12:10,760 --> 01:12:12,880
is going to inflict another speech on us.

1224
01:12:12,960 --> 01:12:16,430
Oh, no. I'm supposed to be
driving Will home.

1225
01:12:16,640 --> 01:12:18,596
Ah, yes. Young Will.

1226
01:12:18,760 --> 01:12:20,512
He was her chance, you know.

1227
01:12:20,680 --> 01:12:23,148
Only one of that lot
that was worth a damn.

1228
01:12:23,320 --> 01:12:24,435
Terrible shame.

1229
01:12:24,600 --> 01:12:25,715
Well, he's not dead.

1230
01:12:25,880 --> 01:12:27,313
No, I meant for her, not him.

1231
01:12:28,000 --> 01:12:29,433
No, Rupert's an arsehole.

1232
01:12:30,280 --> 01:12:32,191
You take care of him.

1233
01:12:32,360 --> 01:12:33,839
He's a good one.

1234
01:12:34,000 --> 01:12:37,276
Take it from one who knows.
Four marriages and counting.

1235
01:12:56,960 --> 01:12:59,110
Thank you so much for coming, Will.

1236
01:12:59,280 --> 01:13:00,474
It was a lovely day.

1237
01:13:00,640 --> 01:13:02,278
I wouldn't have missed it for the world.

1238
01:13:02,880 --> 01:13:03,880
You remember Louisa?

1239
01:13:04,040 --> 01:13:05,678
Oh, yes. Yes.

1240
01:13:05,840 --> 01:13:08,035
Anyway, you're a real star for being here.

1241
01:13:08,200 --> 01:13:10,475
And thank you for the, um...

1242
01:13:12,120 --> 01:13:13,235
- For the...
- Mirror.

1243
01:13:13,400 --> 01:13:15,516
Yes, the mirror.
Absolutely love that mirror.

1244
01:13:16,400 --> 01:13:17,913
Anyway, thank you.

1245
01:13:20,480 --> 01:13:21,833
You didn't buy her a mirror.

1246
01:13:22,040 --> 01:13:23,314
I know.

1247
01:13:23,480 --> 01:13:24,799
Okay, you.

1248
01:13:26,800 --> 01:13:28,711
And, what do you say?
You gonna give me a whirl?

1249
01:13:28,920 --> 01:13:31,150
What? How many of those did you drink?

1250
01:13:31,320 --> 01:13:34,357
Come on, let's give these tossers
something to talk about.

1251
01:13:34,520 --> 01:13:35,839
- All right.
- Whoo.

1252
01:13:38,480 --> 01:13:40,516
- He's ruining everything.
- And her.

1253
01:13:40,680 --> 01:13:42,033
Are they all appalled?

1254
01:13:42,200 --> 01:13:43,519
Yes.

1255
01:13:44,880 --> 01:13:45,995
Yeah.

1256
01:13:47,560 --> 01:13:49,949
Move closer. You smell fantastic.

1257
01:13:52,360 --> 01:13:54,351
You never would've let
those breasts so near to me

1258
01:13:54,520 --> 01:13:55,669
if I wasn't in a wheelchair.

1259
01:13:55,840 --> 01:13:56,840
Oh, yeah?

1260
01:13:57,000 --> 01:13:58,976
Well, you never would've been
looking at these breasts

1261
01:13:59,000 --> 01:14:00,400
if you hadn't been in a wheelchair.

1262
01:14:00,520 --> 01:14:01,520
What? Of course, I would.

1263
01:14:01,680 --> 01:14:03,033
No, you wouldn't.

1264
01:14:03,200 --> 01:14:05,400
You would've been too busy
looking at the leggy blondes.

1265
01:14:05,520 --> 01:14:08,671
The ones who can smell
an expense account at 40 paces.

1266
01:14:08,880 --> 01:14:11,519
And, anyway, I would've been
over there serving the drinks.

1267
01:14:11,680 --> 01:14:13,193
One of the invisibles.

1268
01:14:13,360 --> 01:14:14,759
Am I right?

1269
01:14:14,920 --> 01:14:17,195
Yes, but in my defense...

1270
01:14:17,360 --> 01:14:18,952
I was an arse.

1271
01:14:19,120 --> 01:14:20,348
Yep.

1272
01:14:22,200 --> 01:14:24,475
Do you know something, Clark?

1273
01:14:24,640 --> 01:14:26,437
You are pretty much the only thing

1274
01:14:26,600 --> 01:14:28,320
that makes me want to get up
in the morning.

1275
01:14:29,200 --> 01:14:31,191
Then let's go somewhere.

1276
01:14:31,400 --> 01:14:34,039
Anywhere in the world. Just you and me.

1277
01:14:34,240 --> 01:14:35,639
What do you say?

1278
01:14:38,080 --> 01:14:40,116
Say yes, Will.

1279
01:14:41,400 --> 01:14:42,549
Go on.

1280
01:14:44,880 --> 01:14:46,757
- Okay.
- Yeah?

1281
01:14:46,960 --> 01:14:48,154
All the way to the hotel.

1282
01:14:48,320 --> 01:14:50,120
This is going to go very wrong.
You know that?

1283
01:14:50,160 --> 01:14:52,310
No, this is going to be brilliant!

1284
01:14:52,480 --> 01:14:53,560
Oh...

1285
01:14:53,640 --> 01:14:56,757
I don't think you're driving
in a straight line!

1286
01:15:09,840 --> 01:15:11,576
Why didn't you return
any of my calls?

1287
01:15:11,600 --> 01:15:13,238
I was worried sick.

1288
01:15:13,440 --> 01:15:14,440
Are you all right?

1289
01:15:14,600 --> 01:15:16,296
I think I'm old enough to
spend a night in a hotel

1290
01:15:16,320 --> 01:15:18,197
without permission, Mother, okay?

1291
01:15:19,160 --> 01:15:20,275
Okay.

1292
01:15:23,000 --> 01:15:24,274
Right.

1293
01:15:32,160 --> 01:15:33,832
I'm guessing she didn't do your tubes.

1294
01:15:34,000 --> 01:15:36,116
She did manage to get the
porter to help me into bed.

1295
01:15:36,280 --> 01:15:38,316
This is not good, mate. You're sweating.

1296
01:15:38,480 --> 01:15:40,436
Look at me. How's your eyesight?

1297
01:15:40,640 --> 01:15:42,995
I'm pretty sure you're Nathan. Am I right?

1298
01:15:43,160 --> 01:15:45,833
Yeah, I'm pretty sure you've
been on the drink. Am I right?

1299
01:15:46,000 --> 01:15:47,035
I'll be fine.

1300
01:15:47,200 --> 01:15:48,269
Jesus, Will.

1301
01:15:48,480 --> 01:15:50,630
We had a nice time.

1302
01:15:51,320 --> 01:15:52,639
You what?

1303
01:15:53,160 --> 01:15:55,515
I'm not coming to
Xtreme whatever-it's-called.

1304
01:15:55,680 --> 01:15:56,999
To Norway.

1305
01:15:57,400 --> 01:15:58,879
They need me at work!

1306
01:15:59,040 --> 01:16:00,240
But you said you'd support me.

1307
01:16:00,400 --> 01:16:01,992
I am supporting you, Patrick!

1308
01:16:02,200 --> 01:16:04,794
I hate cycling, and you know I do.

1309
01:16:07,840 --> 01:16:10,308
But there's this trip
I've got to go on with Will.

1310
01:16:10,840 --> 01:16:12,637
Why can't they just get an agency nurse?

1311
01:16:13,440 --> 01:16:14,998
Because it's my job!

1312
01:16:18,200 --> 01:16:20,316
What is this, Lou?

1313
01:16:20,480 --> 01:16:22,994
Your job seems to take priority
over everything these days.

1314
01:16:23,160 --> 01:16:26,152
Patrick, this is important, okay?
Trust me.

1315
01:16:26,320 --> 01:16:27,753
But it's Norway!

1316
01:16:28,320 --> 01:16:30,038
It's meant to be our holiday!

1317
01:16:31,320 --> 01:16:33,038
I just can't.

1318
01:16:34,560 --> 01:16:35,788
Oh, Pat.

1319
01:16:58,200 --> 01:16:59,599
He's stable.

1320
01:17:00,600 --> 01:17:02,750
But pneumonia?

1321
01:17:02,920 --> 01:17:04,558
He only had a cough on Saturday morning.

1322
01:17:04,760 --> 01:17:07,877
His lungs are weak,
any bacteria hits him hard.

1323
01:17:10,040 --> 01:17:11,473
Can I go in?

1324
01:17:11,640 --> 01:17:13,551
Oh, Camilla's with him.

1325
01:17:13,720 --> 01:17:15,676
Best leave her to it.

1326
01:17:17,880 --> 01:17:20,474
It's his fourth bout in two years.

1327
01:17:20,640 --> 01:17:22,915
The last one nearly killed him.

1328
01:17:44,080 --> 01:17:45,115
Thank you.

1329
01:17:47,800 --> 01:17:49,313
How's he doing?

1330
01:17:51,160 --> 01:17:53,390
He's a little better, I think.

1331
01:17:54,880 --> 01:17:57,952
Would you like me to
take over for a while?

1332
01:18:00,840 --> 01:18:03,593
I would really like to change my clothes.

1333
01:18:03,760 --> 01:18:04,909
Sure.

1334
01:18:37,840 --> 01:18:38,909
Hey.

1335
01:18:46,040 --> 01:18:48,031
How are you feeling?

1336
01:18:51,600 --> 01:18:52,635
Been better.

1337
01:18:53,160 --> 01:18:54,195
Oh, I don't know.

1338
01:18:54,360 --> 01:18:56,828
You'll do anything
for attention, Will Traynor.

1339
01:18:58,240 --> 01:19:01,152
I don't think I can do witty today, Clark.

1340
01:19:17,920 --> 01:19:19,399
Hey, just dropping off

1341
01:19:19,560 --> 01:19:21,320
- some meds for when he gets back.
- Mmm-hmm.

1342
01:19:22,200 --> 01:19:23,349
You all right?

1343
01:19:23,520 --> 01:19:26,239
Yeah, yeah.
Just, um, canceling everything.

1344
01:19:37,520 --> 01:19:39,556
You know, don't you?

1345
01:19:40,040 --> 01:19:41,553
Yeah.

1346
01:19:41,720 --> 01:19:44,029
Oh, I've been with him two years.

1347
01:19:44,200 --> 01:19:45,519
His life is hard.

1348
01:19:46,360 --> 01:19:48,112
He hides his pain when he's with you.

1349
01:19:48,280 --> 01:19:50,160
But there have been times
when I've stayed over,

1350
01:19:50,280 --> 01:19:51,793
and I hear him screaming.

1351
01:19:51,960 --> 01:19:55,032
In his dreams, he's still
running or skiing,

1352
01:19:55,200 --> 01:19:56,428
doing things, you know.

1353
01:19:56,640 --> 01:20:00,315
And then he wakes up
and there's nothing I can say to him.

1354
01:20:01,200 --> 01:20:04,397
Now, I can't judge what he wants to do.

1355
01:20:04,560 --> 01:20:06,118
That's his choice.

1356
01:20:06,320 --> 01:20:08,914
But that was before me.

1357
01:20:09,080 --> 01:20:13,517
Yeah, and I know that he did pretty much
anything to make you happy.

1358
01:20:13,680 --> 01:20:17,116
Look, I want him to live, Lou.

1359
01:20:18,040 --> 01:20:19,871
But only if he wants to live.

1360
01:20:20,280 --> 01:20:22,111
I can't just let this happen.

1361
01:20:22,760 --> 01:20:23,954
I can't.

1362
01:20:24,120 --> 01:20:26,270
And we're running out of time.

1363
01:20:26,440 --> 01:20:32,117
So, if I could come up with another trip
that the doctors would agree to,

1364
01:20:32,280 --> 01:20:34,589
would you come with us?

1365
01:20:36,120 --> 01:20:37,553
Yeah.

1366
01:20:37,720 --> 01:20:39,199
Of course I would.

1367
01:20:49,320 --> 01:20:50,435
Hi.

1368
01:20:53,640 --> 01:20:55,995
This is unexpected.

1369
01:20:57,280 --> 01:20:59,271
I've bought your parents cinema tickets

1370
01:20:59,440 --> 01:21:01,670
and Granddad's in his room.
Asleep, I think.

1371
01:21:01,840 --> 01:21:04,035
You bribed my parents
and jailed my granddad.

1372
01:21:04,200 --> 01:21:05,349
Good.

1373
01:21:05,520 --> 01:21:06,953
I am an idiot.

1374
01:21:07,120 --> 01:21:09,190
But this job of yours
is just for a few more weeks.

1375
01:21:09,360 --> 01:21:11,715
Things will soon be back to normal.

1376
01:21:12,680 --> 01:21:16,150
I should be proud that you're
doing something worthwhile.

1377
01:21:18,200 --> 01:21:20,794
I don't want to argue with you, Lou.

1378
01:21:22,800 --> 01:21:25,314
- Less than 300 calories.
- Mmm.

1379
01:21:32,480 --> 01:21:33,879
What's this?

1380
01:21:36,400 --> 01:21:38,516
Oh, it's the trip I told you about.

1381
01:21:39,360 --> 01:21:42,238
I thought you meant Lourdes or something.

1382
01:21:42,800 --> 01:21:44,916
"Hot tub under the stars."

1383
01:21:45,080 --> 01:21:47,514
"Massages. Swim with dolphins."

1384
01:21:47,680 --> 01:21:50,911
Oh, look. "Five-star luxury,
24-hour room service."

1385
01:21:51,640 --> 01:21:53,312
This isn't work.

1386
01:21:54,880 --> 01:21:56,336
Do you really expect me to just sit here

1387
01:21:56,360 --> 01:21:58,749
while you swan off with
another man on a honeymoon?

1388
01:21:58,920 --> 01:22:00,319
His other caregiver's coming, too.

1389
01:22:00,480 --> 01:22:02,914
Oh, two guys. That's all right, then.

1390
01:22:03,080 --> 01:22:05,036
Patrick, this is really important.

1391
01:22:05,680 --> 01:22:07,591
Do you know how this feels?

1392
01:22:09,080 --> 01:22:11,548
It's like I'm running permanently

1393
01:22:11,720 --> 01:22:14,359
just a little behind
the rest of the field.

1394
01:22:14,520 --> 01:22:17,512
It's like, there's something
bad around the bend,

1395
01:22:17,680 --> 01:22:19,671
and everyone seems to
know what it is except me.

1396
01:22:19,840 --> 01:22:20,909
Patrick...

1397
01:22:21,120 --> 01:22:23,759
Seven years we've been together, Lou.

1398
01:22:23,920 --> 01:22:25,831
You've known him five months.

1399
01:22:26,040 --> 01:22:27,109
But he needs me.

1400
01:22:27,680 --> 01:22:29,033
And I don't?

1401
01:22:30,720 --> 01:22:32,233
I'm sorry.

1402
01:22:55,960 --> 01:22:57,871
Well, you got him here.

1403
01:22:59,760 --> 01:23:02,069
- Cheers, mate.
- Thank you, sir.

1404
01:23:18,560 --> 01:23:19,754
Bienvenue.

1405
01:23:20,080 --> 01:23:21,957
Let me show you to your rooms.

1406
01:23:48,160 --> 01:23:49,593
Hey, you.

1407
01:23:52,200 --> 01:23:53,599
How are you feeling?

1408
01:23:54,720 --> 01:23:55,720
Better.

1409
01:23:55,920 --> 01:23:58,195
So, what's the plan for today?

1410
01:23:58,800 --> 01:24:00,280
Um, well, we can stay here for a bit.

1411
01:24:00,440 --> 01:24:02,112
Because they rent DVDs at the front desk.

1412
01:24:02,280 --> 01:24:05,556
We didn't come all this way
to watch DVDs, Clark.

1413
01:24:09,680 --> 01:24:11,238
Stop, stop. Hey!

1414
01:24:11,480 --> 01:24:12,480
Oh!

1415
01:24:20,920 --> 01:24:22,035
Is there alcohol in that?

1416
01:24:22,240 --> 01:24:23,832
Rum, vodka and Cointreau, sir.

1417
01:24:24,000 --> 01:24:25,592
She'll have two, please.

1418
01:24:25,760 --> 01:24:27,478
- Yes, sir.
- Thank you.

1419
01:24:50,320 --> 01:24:52,914
Oh, I booked you in
for scuba diving tomorrow.

1420
01:24:53,080 --> 01:24:56,152
Even after I said I didn't want to. Will!

1421
01:24:57,640 --> 01:24:58,709
- Hey!
- Hi.

1422
01:24:58,880 --> 01:25:00,393
- Hey.
- Hi.

1423
01:25:00,560 --> 01:25:02,437
I'm gonna walk Karen back to her hotel.

1424
01:25:02,600 --> 01:25:04,750
I'm just not sure she should
walk back alone.

1425
01:25:04,920 --> 01:25:06,194
Very chivalrous of you.

1426
01:25:06,360 --> 01:25:08,316
Yeah, it's very civic-minded.

1427
01:25:08,480 --> 01:25:10,311
Oh, piss off, the both you.

1428
01:25:11,760 --> 01:25:13,416
Yeah, I've got everything
covered, don't worry.

1429
01:25:13,440 --> 01:25:14,440
We'll be fine.

1430
01:25:14,600 --> 01:25:17,398
All right. Yeah, we'll see you later.

1431
01:25:17,560 --> 01:25:19,391
- Bye!
- Have fun.

1432
01:25:31,600 --> 01:25:32,715
No, don't.

1433
01:25:32,880 --> 01:25:34,598
Leave them open.

1434
01:25:34,760 --> 01:25:35,875
I wanna see it.

1435
01:25:52,280 --> 01:25:55,113
Don't go back to your room tonight, Clark.

1436
01:26:49,840 --> 01:26:51,558
- Just do it.
- No, I can't! I can't.

1437
01:26:51,720 --> 01:26:53,153
It's gonna be too deep, so I can't.

1438
01:26:53,320 --> 01:26:54,799
You can. You can do anything.

1439
01:26:59,320 --> 01:27:00,548
Mmm-mmm.

1440
01:27:04,680 --> 01:27:06,511
Why didn't you make me do that earlier?

1441
01:27:06,680 --> 01:27:07,999
That was amazing!

1442
01:27:08,200 --> 01:27:09,633
I don't know, Clark!

1443
01:27:09,800 --> 01:27:11,756
Some people just won't be told!

1444
01:27:20,120 --> 01:27:22,076
I don't wanna go home.

1445
01:27:22,320 --> 01:27:23,673
This has...

1446
01:27:23,880 --> 01:27:25,836
This has been the best.

1447
01:27:26,520 --> 01:27:29,273
You're glad you came, right?

1448
01:27:29,440 --> 01:27:30,509
Yes.

1449
01:27:49,440 --> 01:27:50,509
You.

1450
01:27:51,200 --> 01:27:54,158
You are something else, Clark.

1451
01:27:56,440 --> 01:27:57,555
Well.

1452
01:28:24,680 --> 01:28:26,875
I have to tell you something.

1453
01:28:27,040 --> 01:28:28,040
I know.

1454
01:28:28,520 --> 01:28:29,748
I know about Switzerland.

1455
01:28:30,800 --> 01:28:32,995
I have known for months.

1456
01:28:34,400 --> 01:28:38,188
Listen, I know this is not
how you would have chosen it,

1457
01:28:39,520 --> 01:28:42,717
but I can make you happy.

1458
01:28:43,800 --> 01:28:45,711
- No.
- What?

1459
01:28:45,920 --> 01:28:47,194
No, Clark.

1460
01:28:48,520 --> 01:28:51,432
I get that this could be a good life.

1461
01:28:51,600 --> 01:28:54,114
But it's not my life.

1462
01:28:54,880 --> 01:28:56,757
It's not even close.

1463
01:28:58,040 --> 01:28:59,996
You never saw me before.

1464
01:29:01,360 --> 01:29:03,191
I loved my life.

1465
01:29:03,400 --> 01:29:06,392
I really loved it.

1466
01:29:08,800 --> 01:29:11,837
I can't be the kind of man
who just accepts this.

1467
01:29:12,000 --> 01:29:14,070
You're not giving it a chance.

1468
01:29:14,280 --> 01:29:16,999
You're not giving me a chance.

1469
01:29:17,480 --> 01:29:22,793
I have become a whole new person
these last six months because of you.

1470
01:29:23,080 --> 01:29:26,311
I know. And that's why
I can't have you tied to me.

1471
01:29:27,440 --> 01:29:29,158
I don't want you

1472
01:29:30,200 --> 01:29:33,590
to miss all the things that
someone else could give you.

1473
01:29:34,280 --> 01:29:37,192
And selfishly, I don't want
you to look at me one day

1474
01:29:37,360 --> 01:29:40,352
and feel even the tiniest bit
of regret or pity.

1475
01:29:40,560 --> 01:29:41,913
I would never think that!

1476
01:29:42,080 --> 01:29:43,479
You don't know that.

1477
01:29:44,360 --> 01:29:46,590
I can't watch you

1478
01:29:46,760 --> 01:29:50,196
wandering around the annex
in your crazy dresses.

1479
01:29:53,440 --> 01:29:55,874
Or see you naked and not...

1480
01:29:57,440 --> 01:29:59,874
Not be able to do...

1481
01:30:00,080 --> 01:30:04,596
Oh, God, Clark, if you had any idea
what I wanna do to you right now.

1482
01:30:08,480 --> 01:30:10,311
I can't live like this.

1483
01:30:10,520 --> 01:30:13,478
Please. Will, please.

1484
01:30:14,920 --> 01:30:16,273
Listen.

1485
01:30:17,200 --> 01:30:18,713
This,

1486
01:30:18,880 --> 01:30:21,792
tonight, being with you

1487
01:30:22,880 --> 01:30:27,829
is the most wonderful thing
you could have ever done for me.

1488
01:30:31,520 --> 01:30:34,114
But I need it to end here.

1489
01:30:35,560 --> 01:30:37,790
No more pain and exhaustion

1490
01:30:37,960 --> 01:30:42,238
and waking up every morning
already wishing it was over.

1491
01:30:44,640 --> 01:30:47,074
It's not going to get better than this.

1492
01:30:48,080 --> 01:30:50,913
The doctors know it and I know it.

1493
01:30:53,960 --> 01:30:57,509
When we get back,
I am going to Switzerland.

1494
01:30:57,720 --> 01:30:59,551
So I'm asking you

1495
01:30:59,800 --> 01:31:02,917
if you feel the things you say you feel,

1496
01:31:03,640 --> 01:31:05,232
come with me.

1497
01:31:07,680 --> 01:31:10,478
I thought that
I was changing your mind!

1498
01:31:10,640 --> 01:31:12,551
Nothing was ever going to change my mind.

1499
01:31:13,200 --> 01:31:17,113
I promised my parents six months,
and that's what I've given them.

1500
01:31:19,800 --> 01:31:21,711
No!

1501
01:31:22,960 --> 01:31:24,359
No.

1502
01:31:24,520 --> 01:31:26,954
Don't say another word.

1503
01:31:27,120 --> 01:31:28,951
You're so selfish.

1504
01:31:29,120 --> 01:31:34,911
I tore my heart out in front of you,
and here all you can say is no.

1505
01:31:36,000 --> 01:31:37,558
And now you want me to come and watch

1506
01:31:37,760 --> 01:31:40,354
the worst thing
you could possibly imagine.

1507
01:31:40,520 --> 01:31:42,875
Do you have any idea what you're asking?

1508
01:31:43,560 --> 01:31:47,030
I wish I had never taken this stupid job!

1509
01:31:47,200 --> 01:31:49,714
I wish I had never met you.

1510
01:31:51,160 --> 01:31:52,388
Louisa.

1511
01:31:57,360 --> 01:31:58,588
Louisa!

1512
01:32:22,440 --> 01:32:24,237
You all right?

1513
01:32:24,400 --> 01:32:25,549
Fine.

1514
01:33:51,840 --> 01:33:53,876
Oh, look at you.

1515
01:33:54,040 --> 01:33:56,600
- You look wonderful!
- You do.

1516
01:33:57,440 --> 01:33:59,954
Great photos of you on the beach.
Swimming, too?

1517
01:34:00,120 --> 01:34:01,633
Yeah, it was great.

1518
01:34:03,520 --> 01:34:04,794
How was the flight?

1519
01:34:04,960 --> 01:34:06,996
Well, we got here in one piece.

1520
01:34:08,440 --> 01:34:11,637
Are you hungry? 'Cause we can eat
at the restaurant in the Intercontinental.

1521
01:34:11,800 --> 01:34:13,711
- I could eat.
- Excellent.

1522
01:34:13,880 --> 01:34:16,155
Louisa, let me give you a hand with those.

1523
01:34:16,320 --> 01:34:18,914
Actually, I need to get home.

1524
01:34:19,080 --> 01:34:21,469
Come on. We want to know how you got on.

1525
01:34:21,640 --> 01:34:22,993
Let her go.

1526
01:34:34,200 --> 01:34:35,315
Louisa!

1527
01:34:35,920 --> 01:34:37,114
Louisa!

1528
01:34:38,000 --> 01:34:39,194
Louisa!

1529
01:34:40,000 --> 01:34:42,355
Wait. Louisa, please.

1530
01:34:42,520 --> 01:34:43,999
You don't need to pay me.

1531
01:34:44,720 --> 01:34:46,039
I'm sorry.

1532
01:35:21,000 --> 01:35:22,000
Well?

1533
01:35:42,840 --> 01:35:45,434
Sit down, Josie, love. Please.

1534
01:35:45,600 --> 01:35:47,238
Lou's upset enough.

1535
01:35:47,400 --> 01:35:49,277
And his parents know?

1536
01:35:50,840 --> 01:35:53,991
I mean, what kind of people are they?

1537
01:35:54,160 --> 01:35:57,118
Mrs. Traynor doesn't know
what else she can do.

1538
01:35:57,480 --> 01:35:58,595
It's his choice.

1539
01:35:58,760 --> 01:36:00,990
Some choices you don't get to make.

1540
01:36:01,160 --> 01:36:02,479
He's not in his right mind.

1541
01:36:02,760 --> 01:36:05,136
People that are vulnerable
should not be given a chance to...

1542
01:36:05,160 --> 01:36:06,593
It's complicated, Mum.

1543
01:36:06,760 --> 01:36:08,478
- It is not. It's simple.
- Mum.

1544
01:36:08,640 --> 01:36:11,313
No. You can't be a part of this.

1545
01:36:12,200 --> 01:36:13,599
It's no better than murder.

1546
01:36:47,080 --> 01:36:49,036
I tried, Dad.

1547
01:36:49,760 --> 01:36:51,990
I tried so hard,

1548
01:36:52,960 --> 01:36:54,678
but I failed.

1549
01:36:59,840 --> 01:37:02,229
Who says you failed?

1550
01:37:06,920 --> 01:37:09,957
I'm not sure anyone in the world

1551
01:37:10,520 --> 01:37:14,433
could ever persuade that man,
once he'd set his mind to something.

1552
01:37:15,680 --> 01:37:17,910
You can't change who people are.

1553
01:37:18,360 --> 01:37:20,112
Then what can you do?

1554
01:37:20,280 --> 01:37:21,599
You love them.

1555
01:37:23,040 --> 01:37:25,600
No one could have done more than you.

1556
01:37:26,160 --> 01:37:30,233
You have a heart as big as that castle,
and I love you for it.

1557
01:37:30,760 --> 01:37:34,036
Have you seen them? Mr. Traynor?

1558
01:37:35,160 --> 01:37:37,674
They left. This morning.

1559
01:37:40,240 --> 01:37:42,754
Dad, have I made a huge mistake?

1560
01:37:49,360 --> 01:37:50,679
Call them.

1561
01:37:51,400 --> 01:37:53,311
You still have time.

1562
01:37:59,600 --> 01:38:01,955
Don't worry. Mum will come round.

1563
01:38:02,120 --> 01:38:03,872
I'll talk to her.

1564
01:38:04,040 --> 01:38:05,598
You're doing the right thing, Lou.

1565
01:38:06,400 --> 01:38:08,038
You have to go.

1566
01:38:08,800 --> 01:38:11,314
You were useless until you met him.

1567
01:38:51,840 --> 01:38:52,989
Hello.

1568
01:38:53,840 --> 01:38:54,989
Hello.

1569
01:38:55,160 --> 01:38:56,673
He's just through there.

1570
01:38:56,840 --> 01:38:57,840
Okay.

1571
01:38:58,000 --> 01:38:59,115
Here.

1572
01:38:59,280 --> 01:39:01,111
Oh, thank you. Thanks.

1573
01:39:12,360 --> 01:39:13,554
Oh!

1574
01:39:14,880 --> 01:39:16,199
Sorry, I didn't mean to...

1575
01:39:16,360 --> 01:39:19,796
The familiar sound of Louisa Clark
making an entrance.

1576
01:39:21,280 --> 01:39:23,077
We'll leave you be.

1577
01:39:29,400 --> 01:39:30,515
Thank you.

1578
01:39:40,240 --> 01:39:41,719
Don't tell me.

1579
01:39:41,880 --> 01:39:44,075
You're here to make my last cup of tea.

1580
01:39:45,680 --> 01:39:47,238
Actually, no.

1581
01:39:47,400 --> 01:39:49,356
I'm here to kidnap you.

1582
01:39:49,520 --> 01:39:52,080
I'm gonna steal you and
I'm gonna take you to...

1583
01:39:52,400 --> 01:39:53,400
Where?

1584
01:39:53,560 --> 01:39:54,834
- Rio.
- Mmm.

1585
01:39:55,840 --> 01:39:58,195
Or my mum and dad's.
I haven't quite decided yet.

1586
01:40:04,320 --> 01:40:05,753
Open the doors, Clark.

1587
01:40:26,760 --> 01:40:28,034
Come here.

1588
01:40:37,960 --> 01:40:39,279
Closer.

1589
01:40:54,040 --> 01:40:55,473
Look at me.

1590
01:40:57,200 --> 01:40:59,270
Please, look at me.

1591
01:41:00,320 --> 01:41:01,389
I can't.

1592
01:41:01,560 --> 01:41:02,709
Tough.

1593
01:41:02,880 --> 01:41:04,836
I need to see that face.

1594
01:41:06,160 --> 01:41:08,469
I need to see that face of yours.

1595
01:41:09,480 --> 01:41:12,438
Even if it is all pink and blotchy.

1596
01:41:16,000 --> 01:41:19,072
You really are the most
impossible man, Will Traynor.

1597
01:41:19,240 --> 01:41:22,312
And the world will definitely
be a better place without me.

1598
01:41:22,480 --> 01:41:23,674
No.

1599
01:41:24,760 --> 01:41:26,034
No, it won't.

1600
01:41:34,680 --> 01:41:36,750
Don't be sad, Clark.

1601
01:41:38,000 --> 01:41:40,275
Tell me something good.

1602
01:42:09,360 --> 01:42:11,430
Will you stay?

1603
01:42:13,160 --> 01:42:15,720
For as long as you want me to.

1604
01:43:04,880 --> 01:43:07,269
Can you call my parents in?

1605
01:44:00,920 --> 01:44:02,148
Clark.

1606
01:44:02,840 --> 01:44:05,957
A few weeks should have passed
by the time you read this.

1607
01:44:06,120 --> 01:44:09,078
If you followed the instructions,
you'll be in Paris

1608
01:44:09,240 --> 01:44:12,471
on one of those chairs that never sit
quite level on the pavement.

1609
01:44:12,680 --> 01:44:14,750
I hope it's still sunny.

1610
01:44:16,760 --> 01:44:20,799
Across the bridge to your right
you will see L 'Artisan Parfumeur.

1611
01:44:20,960 --> 01:44:23,599
You should try the scent
called Papillons Extrême.

1612
01:44:23,760 --> 01:44:26,149
I always did think
it would smell great on you.

1613
01:44:31,160 --> 01:44:34,516
There are a few things
I wanted to say and couldn't,

1614
01:44:34,680 --> 01:44:38,673
because you would have got all emotional
and you wouldn't have let me finish.

1615
01:44:40,680 --> 01:44:43,274
So, here it is.

1616
01:44:43,880 --> 01:44:45,029
When you get back home,

1617
01:44:45,200 --> 01:44:47,509
Michael Lawler will give you
access to a bank account

1618
01:44:47,680 --> 01:44:50,148
that contains enough
to give you a new beginning.

1619
01:44:50,320 --> 01:44:52,117
Don't start panicking.

1620
01:44:52,280 --> 01:44:54,874
It's not enough for you to sit around
for the rest of your life,

1621
01:44:55,040 --> 01:44:57,554
but it should buy you your freedom.

1622
01:44:57,720 --> 01:45:00,553
At least from that little town
we both call home.

1623
01:45:02,160 --> 01:45:04,151
Live boldly, Clark.

1624
01:45:04,360 --> 01:45:05,554
Push yourself.

1625
01:45:05,720 --> 01:45:07,153
Don't settle.

1626
01:45:08,400 --> 01:45:10,868
Wear those stripy legs with pride.

1627
01:45:11,040 --> 01:45:14,237
Knowing you still have
possibilities is a luxury.

1628
01:45:14,560 --> 01:45:19,076
Knowing I might have given them to you
has eased something for me.

1629
01:45:20,080 --> 01:45:22,674
So, this is it.

1630
01:45:23,640 --> 01:45:26,837
You are scored on my heart, Clark.

1631
01:45:27,000 --> 01:45:28,991
You were from the first day you walked in

1632
01:45:29,160 --> 01:45:31,754
with your sweet smile
and your ridiculous clothes.

1633
01:45:31,920 --> 01:45:33,558
And your bad jokes

1634
01:45:33,760 --> 01:45:37,469
and your complete inability to ever hide
a single thing you felt.

1635
01:45:38,840 --> 01:45:40,910
Don't think of me too often.

1636
01:45:41,600 --> 01:45:43,477
I don't want you getting sad.

1637
01:45:43,640 --> 01:45:45,232
Just live well.

1638
01:45:46,440 --> 01:45:47,998
Just live.

1639
01:45:49,280 --> 01:45:52,431
I'll be walking beside you
every step of the way.

1640
01:45:53,600 --> 01:45:55,192
Love, Will.
