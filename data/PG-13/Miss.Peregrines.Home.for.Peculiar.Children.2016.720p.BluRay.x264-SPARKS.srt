1
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:01,713
Do you ever feel like
nothing you do matters?

2
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,433
You leave footprints
on the beach,

3
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:05,839
and tomorrow they're gone.

4
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:08,718
Like it's just today
over again.

5
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:12,468
They say your teen years

6
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:14,869
are for making friends
and having fun...

7
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:17,429
which made me feel even worse.

8
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:20,273
Hey, Amy. It's Jake.

9
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:21,998
I'm in your math class.

10
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:24,400
Hey, don't forget
your adult diapers.

11
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:25,480
Yeah, right.

12
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,798
Jake. Phone for you.

13
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:38,874
But that day,
everything changed.

14
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:43,639
Thanks for
the ride, Shelley.

15
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:46,989
So, how come you have to go
deal with your grandpa?

16
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:49,555
My dad couldn't
get out of work.

17
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:51,790
I didn't think he worked.

18
00:03:56,040 --> 00:03:59,112
I'm just gonna call Grandpa.

19
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:03,039
Hello, this is Abe.

20
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:04,679
Hey, it's Jake.

21
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:08,071
No! Don't come here.
Listen to me.

22
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:09,912
It's not safe.

23
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:11,115
Stay away.

24
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:13,635
Grandpa, did you take
your pills today?

25
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:17,509
The key to my gun cabinet,
it was in the drawer.

26
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:18,999
And now it's gone.

27
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:22,359
Yeah, Dad took it,
all right?

28
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:25,637
For safekeeping. It's okay.

29
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:28,400
Your father wants I should
fight them without a gun?

30
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:35,599
God bless him.

31
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:38,156
What's his deal,
Alzheimer's?

32
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:39,993
Dementia.

33
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:02,959
That guy gave me
the heebie-jeebies.

34
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:14,591
Holler if you need me.

35
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:23,908
Grandpa?

36
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:49,360
Shelley!

37
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:56,280
What's goin' on?

38
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:57,869
Someone broke in.

39
00:05:58,200 --> 00:06:00,589
I've got a.38 in my car.
You wait there.

40
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:50,709
Grandpa!

41
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:05,296
911. What's your emergency?

42
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:07,515
911? Yeah,
I need the paramedics.

43
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:09,989
It's at 2040 Palm Circle.
My grandpa...

44
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:12,376
Sir, what's your emergency?

45
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:13,400
Grandpa.

46
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:15,471
You have to get away
from here.

47
00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:16,920
Sir, can you hear me?

48
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:18,791
Please. Listen.

49
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,672
Go to the island.

50
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:22,637
Sir, paramedics
are on their way.

51
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:24,916
Find Emerson.

52
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:27,832
The postcard.

53
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,513
Go to the loop.

54
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:32,399
September 3rd, 1943.

55
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:34,109
It's okay.

56
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:36,191
Just don't move. There's
an ambulance coming.

57
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:39,272
I know you think I'm crazy.

58
00:07:39,640 --> 00:07:42,473
But the bird
will explain everything.

59
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:46,717
Will you do this, Tygrysku?
Promise me?

60
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:48,313
I promise, yes.

61
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:50,914
I thought I could protect you.

62
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:57,154
I should have told you
years ago.

63
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:06,315
Grandpa. Tell me what?

64
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:07,908
Grandpa!

65
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:30,078
Shelley, behind you!

66
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:47,198
There was no one there.

67
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:49,957
May I say, Jake...

68
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:52,270
that considering this
was only a month ago...

69
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:54,908
I think you're doing
exceptionally well.

70
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:57,789
Apart from being crazy?

71
00:08:58,680 --> 00:09:02,229
Having nightmares and anxiety
doesn't make you crazy.

72
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:05,915
What about seeing things
which aren't there?

73
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:07,176
Actually,
in traumatic situations,

74
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:08,428
it's not at all uncommon.

75
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:12,195
Your subconscious mind drew
an image from a movie or...

76
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:13,833
It was a story.

77
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:17,588
My grandpa told me stories
when I was a kid...

78
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:20,479
about monsters that
he fought in the war.

79
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:21,640
So there you go.

80
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:23,518
He was
brutally attacked...

81
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:26,990
and in your head, the man who
did it was inhuman, a monster.

82
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:29,435
It wasn't a man, though.

83
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:31,916
The cops said that dogs

84
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,195
scratched up
the screen door...

85
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:37,318
and he chased them off
into the woods.

86
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:39,675
And the coroner said
he had a heart attack.

87
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:41,832
And the cops said...

88
00:09:44,280 --> 00:09:46,874
that dogs go
for the soft parts.

89
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:49,558
They DNA tested the fork...

90
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:52,553
and it had animal DNA.

91
00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:54,990
So, that's case closed.

92
00:09:56,120 --> 00:09:58,839
He sounds like
an extraordinary gentleman.

93
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:01,276
Were you very close?

94
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:02,920
Puerto Rico.

95
00:10:04,280 --> 00:10:05,280
Here.

96
00:10:05,560 --> 00:10:08,438
There's a lake where the
water glows in the dark.

97
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:10,512
And a secret tunnel.

98
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:12,989
That's where I hid
from the monsters.

99
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:15,357
He used to
babysit me a lot.

100
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:17,791
When I was with him,
I felt special.

101
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:21,118
My duck was dry again.

102
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:25,671
Abe. It's, like, 11:00.
What is he doing up?

103
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,638
I'm gonna
be an explorer.

104
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:31,632
Grandpa's helping me
plan my first voyage.

105
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:33,950
Everything's already
been discovered, buddy.

106
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:37,256
They terrorize each other...

107
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:39,953
before wreaking havoc
on the rest of the island.

108
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:41,400
Pay no attention
to your father.

109
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:42,509
He knows bubkes.

110
00:10:42,680 --> 00:10:46,036
Come, Tygrysku. Off to bed.

111
00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:49,553
And they're not choosy.

112
00:10:49,640 --> 00:10:51,358
These talons
come in squadrons.

113
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:54,714
Touchdown,
Florida! What a drive.

114
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:56,918
Can you tell me a story?

115
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,000
The usual?

116
00:10:58,080 --> 00:10:59,080
Mmm-hmm.

117
00:10:59,560 --> 00:11:02,791
Okay. Once upon a time...

118
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:04,234
there was a little boy...

119
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:05,799
With the pictures.

120
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:07,589
Pictures.

121
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:17,039
Once upon a time...

122
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:19,839
there was a little boy
called Abe.

123
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,319
That was you.

124
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:22,760
That was me.

125
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:26,151
And he lived in a
lovely children's home

126
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:27,878
on a little island
near Wales...

127
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:30,230
where the sun
shone every day.

128
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:34,198
The headmistress,
Miss Peregrine...

129
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:36,237
was very clever.

130
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:38,868
And she smoked a pipe.

131
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:40,189
She could turn into a bird.

132
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:41,509
Mmm-hmm.

133
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:45,679
It was a home
for special children...

134
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:49,071
like Bronwyn and Victor.

135
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:52,799
They were both as strong
as 10 men.

136
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:54,749
And Hugh...

137
00:11:54,920 --> 00:11:58,310
Hugh had bees
living inside him.

138
00:11:59,640 --> 00:12:00,640
Where's Emma?

139
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:02,552
She could float.

140
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:06,630
She was lighter than air.

141
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:10,031
She had to wear special
shoes made of lead

142
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:11,951
to keep her
from floating away.

143
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:14,711
Where is she now?

144
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:17,388
She's still on the island,
I believe.

145
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:20,470
My mama and papa
sent me there...

146
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:22,915
to live with
the special children.

147
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:26,436
And now, Tygrysku,
time for sleep.

148
00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:28,437
He used to
call me Tygrysku.

149
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:30,517
It's Polish
for "little tiger."

150
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,195
He couldn't have picked
a less appropriate nickname.

151
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:34,759
I was always a chicken.

152
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:37,593
Why did your mom and dad
send you away?

153
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:42,349
Well, where we lived
in Poland, it wasn't safe.

154
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:44,314
There were monsters.

155
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:46,755
What kind of monsters?

156
00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:50,708
Huge ones,
with long arms...

157
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:52,791
and no eyes...

158
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,560
and tentacles like this.

159
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:00,515
The dumb thing was...

160
00:13:00,680 --> 00:13:02,830
for years, I actually
believed his stories.

161
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:06,595
And this is Millard.
He's invisible.

162
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:16,873
My teacher says
they were trick photos.

163
00:13:17,640 --> 00:13:19,153
And did you believe her?

164
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:21,313
Dad says you probably
found them

165
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:22,674
at a junk store someplace...

166
00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:25,229
when you went traveling.

167
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:27,868
I would never lie
to you, Tygrysku.

168
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:33,478
But you did, about the
home, the monsters.

169
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:36,113
Dad told me.

170
00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:38,596
Your father knows very well

171
00:13:38,680 --> 00:13:40,875
I went to live
in the children's home.

172
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:44,991
He said there really were
monsters in Poland...

173
00:13:45,280 --> 00:13:48,272
just not the kind
with tentacles.

174
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:52,157
He said you got sent to Wales
'cause there were bad people.

175
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:56,599
People who wanted to kill
anyone who was different.

176
00:13:57,600 --> 00:13:59,716
I don't wanna talk
about this anymore.

177
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:02,678
He said the children
were special...

178
00:14:04,040 --> 00:14:06,600
but not the way you said.

179
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:28,357
I'm just saying,
tomorrow was

180
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:30,158
supposed to be a writing day.

181
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:32,993
Five years and
counting on that damn book.

182
00:14:33,160 --> 00:14:35,136
And taking one day to be with
your son on his birthday...

183
00:14:35,160 --> 00:14:36,354
is gonna be a big difference?

184
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:37,560
Fine.

185
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:46,269
You find something good?

186
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:51,153
Oh, look at that.
That's awesome.

187
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:53,352
You should take that.

188
00:14:53,520 --> 00:14:55,397
Come on, buddy,
let's roll.

189
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:58,836
How are you so okay?

190
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:02,873
Jakey, you were a lot closer
to him than I ever was.

191
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:04,871
He was
a wonderful grandpa...

192
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:06,871
but not such a great dad.

193
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:10,428
Never seemed
to pick a job...

194
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:11,919
that didn't involve
late nights

195
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,672
or long trips away, though.

196
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:16,310
Me and Aunt Susie
always kind of thought

197
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:19,233
he was, maybe,
cheating on our mom.

198
00:15:21,560 --> 00:15:23,680
I'm sorry, buddy. I know how
much you worshiped him...

199
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:25,472
but there it is.

200
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:35,799
Surprise!

201
00:15:35,960 --> 00:15:37,109
Happy birthday, Cousin Jake!

202
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:39,016
J-dog, it's great
you're coming

203
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:40,080
to spend a summer with us.

204
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:41,434
Wait till you see
the new boat.

205
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:43,360
Can't wait.

206
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:54,792
It's Aunt Susie.

207
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:57,675
Thought you might
wanna open this one.

208
00:15:57,840 --> 00:15:59,990
It's from your grandpa.

209
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:02,314
Found it while
I was packing up.

210
00:16:02,520 --> 00:16:05,080
I figured he meant to
give it to you someday.

211
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:08,469
Thanks.

212
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:30,633
To Jake, and the worlds
he has yet to discover.

213
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:43,638
My dearest Abe...

214
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:45,870
I hope this card
finds you well.

215
00:16:46,040 --> 00:16:49,077
The children and I yearn
to hear your news.

216
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:51,595
I do hope you will
visit us again soon.

217
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:53,557
We should so love to see you.

218
00:16:53,720 --> 00:16:55,073
With admiration...

219
00:16:55,280 --> 00:16:56,429
Alma Peregrine.

220
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:58,916
H mm. Only two years ago.

221
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:02,078
I suppose it's possible
she could still be alive.

222
00:17:02,640 --> 00:17:03,789
Right.

223
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:06,516
I could meet her.

224
00:17:06,680 --> 00:17:08,113
Maybe even find out
what it was

225
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:09,599
Grandpa wanted me to know.

226
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:11,079
But what if
she's dead?

227
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:12,240
Dr. Golan...

228
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:13,594
we are very concerned

229
00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:15,472
with Jake's state of mind
right now.

230
00:17:15,680 --> 00:17:17,016
There's no way I'm putting
my life on hold

231
00:17:17,040 --> 00:17:18,109
to take you to Wales.

232
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:20,913
Dad could take me.

233
00:17:21,080 --> 00:17:23,674
And he can look at birds...

234
00:17:23,840 --> 00:17:24,989
and work on his book.

235
00:17:25,440 --> 00:17:27,670
It means you get a break.

236
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:29,193
As Dr. Golan said...

237
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:31,595
maybe I can move on.

238
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:33,708
Like, closure.

239
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:37,393
Having an opportunity
to see this children's home...

240
00:17:37,560 --> 00:17:39,676
and separate fantasy
from reality...

241
00:17:40,280 --> 00:17:41,633
may be helpful.

242
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:43,153
And at the very least...

243
00:17:43,320 --> 00:17:45,880
a trip like this provides
a chance to...

244
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:48,199
say goodbye.

245
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:57,114
"Cairnholm.
Population of 92.

246
00:17:57,680 --> 00:17:59,557
"Best known
for its proximity...

247
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:02,718
"to the final resting place
of the cruise liner Augusta...

248
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:05,235
"which sank in 1915.

249
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:07,717
"There is just one hotel..."

250
00:18:08,360 --> 00:18:09,429
That's us.

251
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:11,477
Yeah. I hope there's bourbon.

252
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:15,518
Oh, wow!

253
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:17,398
Jake, check it out.

254
00:18:17,560 --> 00:18:19,676
That's a peregrine falcon.

255
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:22,308
A peregrine,
like the headmistress?

256
00:18:23,080 --> 00:18:24,399
Sure.

257
00:18:24,560 --> 00:18:26,198
That's probably
where Grandpa came up

258
00:18:26,280 --> 00:18:28,032
with that whole turning
into a bird thing.

259
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:31,678
Or maybe,
maybe that's really her!

260
00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:33,359
Hey, Miss Peregrine.

261
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:34,919
It's me, Jake.

262
00:18:35,080 --> 00:18:37,275
I'm Abe Portman's grandson.

263
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:39,590
Please don't crap on us.

264
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:44,069
Oh, my God.
Dad, I'm kidding.

265
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:13,430
What the... Hello?

266
00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:15,589
Hello?

267
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:21,792
Anybody home?

268
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,000
Oh, hey.

269
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:36,435
Any idea where I'd find
the manager of this place?

270
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:38,636
That's me.
Sorry to keep you.

271
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:40,677
Just helping Uncle Oggie
to the loo.

272
00:19:40,760 --> 00:19:41,988
Oh. Oh.

273
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:43,832
I'm Kev.
There's room upstairs.

274
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,000
Oh, great.

275
00:19:45,160 --> 00:19:46,195
I'll be back in a bit.

276
00:19:46,280 --> 00:19:47,315
Okay.

277
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:50,151
Kev's just getting
our suite ready.

278
00:19:51,160 --> 00:19:52,513
Um, while we're waiting...

279
00:19:52,680 --> 00:19:55,274
I thought maybe we could go
check out the beach.

280
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:57,351
I thought we would go
to the children's home.

281
00:19:57,520 --> 00:19:59,795
Is the beach
where the birds nest?

282
00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:02,349
I thought we could just
check it out real quick.

283
00:20:02,520 --> 00:20:05,114
I could go to the home
by myself.

284
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:08,909
Then, you can really
take your time and enjoy it.

285
00:20:09,080 --> 00:20:11,514
Come on, Jakey. You know
your mom would freak.

286
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:14,909
What if we can find
someone to take me?

287
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:17,869
Hey, dudes.

288
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:19,919
Dad. Don't.
Shh! I got this.

289
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:21,720
I was just wondering
if any of you guys...

290
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:23,216
might be interested
in taking my son here

291
00:20:23,240 --> 00:20:25,310
to the other side
of the island.

292
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:41,473
So, what are your names?

293
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:43,631
I'm Worm.
This is MC Dirty D.

294
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:45,034
MC Dirty Bizniz.

295
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:46,235
I thought you changed it.

296
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:47,320
No.

297
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:48,674
No, you did, remember?

298
00:20:48,840 --> 00:20:50,193
When Ruth said
"MC Dirty Bizniz"

299
00:20:50,280 --> 00:20:52,000
made it sound like
you cacked your trousers.

300
00:20:52,160 --> 00:20:54,037
Yeah, but she said
"Dirty D" sounded like

301
00:20:54,120 --> 00:20:55,189
a personal
hygiene problem.

302
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:57,999
Wait. Are these, like,
nicknames, or...

303
00:20:58,160 --> 00:21:00,958
Stage names. We're the
sickest rappers in Wales.

304
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:03,315
Go on, Worm. Show this
Yank how it's done.

305
00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:04,480
What? Now?

306
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:07,320
I like to get wrecked
down the Priest Hole

307
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:09,240
Your dad's always here
'cause he's on the dole

308
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:11,237
Our rhymes are tight
Yet I make it look easy

309
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:13,470
Our beats are hot
like chicken jalfrezi

310
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:17,516
Oh, yeah, no.
It's good.

311
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:20,231
Should we take
the shortcut, D?

312
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:22,516
We'll get there quicker.
Take it from me.

313
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:24,994
What, down here?
Mm-hmm.

314
00:21:25,160 --> 00:21:26,160
Yeah.

315
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:33,320
Go.

316
00:21:40,680 --> 00:21:41,874
This way?

317
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:46,520
What the...

318
00:21:51,480 --> 00:21:54,153
Is this even the way
to the children's home?

319
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:55,992
Right through those trees.

320
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:27,437
No use crying
over a lost shoe, boy-o.

321
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:34,114
The children's home.
What happened to it?

322
00:22:34,280 --> 00:22:37,989
A German air raid.
Bomb fell right on the roof.

323
00:22:38,160 --> 00:22:41,232
September the 3rd, 1943.

324
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:43,356
Where did they go after?

325
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:45,510
The headmistress
and the children.

326
00:22:46,160 --> 00:22:49,118
Not one survivor.
Poor little buggers.

327
00:22:50,040 --> 00:22:52,474
And they were lovely, too.

328
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:56,636
Why didn't he tell us that
they all died?

329
00:22:56,800 --> 00:22:58,640
He leaves to join the army,
and 3 months later,

330
00:22:58,680 --> 00:23:00,875
everyone he knows
gets killed?

331
00:23:01,800 --> 00:23:04,951
Not even Grandpa could turn
that into a bedtime story.

332
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:08,872
Well, no wonder he was
scared of being a dad...

333
00:23:09,040 --> 00:23:10,678
being close to anyone.

334
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:13,789
Listen.

335
00:23:14,920 --> 00:23:17,115
You need to talk about all
this with someone, buddy.

336
00:23:18,120 --> 00:23:19,872
We should call Dr. Golan.

337
00:23:23,800 --> 00:23:26,155
Certainly
some enjoyment today.

338
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:30,736
Er, do you mind
if I go hang out

339
00:23:30,760 --> 00:23:32,159
with those
other kids today?

340
00:23:32,520 --> 00:23:33,520
They asked.

341
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:36,234
Yeah? That's awesome.

342
00:25:11,480 --> 00:25:12,515
Abe?

343
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:26,395
No!

344
00:26:01,920 --> 00:26:02,920
You're Emma!

345
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:05,477
And the twins.

346
00:26:05,640 --> 00:26:06,834
And Olive.

347
00:26:07,560 --> 00:26:08,913
And Bronwyn.

348
00:26:09,880 --> 00:26:10,880
And he's Millard.

349
00:26:11,240 --> 00:26:12,389
Mm-hmm.

350
00:26:12,560 --> 00:26:13,595
No, you're dead.

351
00:26:14,120 --> 00:26:15,758
All of you,
you're all dead.

352
00:26:15,920 --> 00:26:18,673
He's invisible,
but he's still dead.

353
00:26:19,080 --> 00:26:20,149
None of us are dead.

354
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:23,876
Oh, my God. Am I dead?

355
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:25,320
No.

356
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:29,550
You called me Abe.

357
00:26:30,040 --> 00:26:31,996
In the house. Why?

358
00:26:32,160 --> 00:26:33,229
You looked like him.

359
00:26:33,880 --> 00:26:34,880
Just for a moment,

360
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:37,030
before you started
screaming...

361
00:26:37,240 --> 00:26:39,071
running away,
and concussing yourself.

362
00:26:39,280 --> 00:26:40,713
Wait. What's happening?

363
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:42,336
We're waiting until
the coast is clear...

364
00:26:42,360 --> 00:26:43,759
before we go
into the loop.

365
00:26:45,040 --> 00:26:47,679
You never know
who might be watching.

366
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:50,354
Wait. Before we
go into what?

367
00:26:50,520 --> 00:26:51,520
Please, Jake.

368
00:26:51,680 --> 00:26:54,035
Miss Peregrine's waiting.
She saw you on the ferry.

369
00:26:54,200 --> 00:26:55,315
She sent us to get you.

370
00:27:45,880 --> 00:27:46,880
Hey!

371
00:27:48,120 --> 00:27:49,633
Where do you think
you're going?

372
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:51,834
To my room.

373
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:55,352
I'm a guest here.

374
00:27:55,800 --> 00:27:58,997
Does this look like
a hotel to you?

375
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:02,073
Yeah.

376
00:28:02,280 --> 00:28:04,635
No. I've got a key.

377
00:28:05,640 --> 00:28:07,790
Talk to the manager.
He'll tell you.

378
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:09,709
I'm the manager, boy.

379
00:28:10,680 --> 00:28:12,352
He's American.
Maybe he's army?

380
00:28:13,640 --> 00:28:14,675
Bollocks.

381
00:28:14,760 --> 00:28:16,591
Listen to his accent.
It's terrible.

382
00:28:17,800 --> 00:28:19,597
He's a spy.

383
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:21,915
What?

384
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,275
No, I'm not.
I'm a tourist.

385
00:28:24,440 --> 00:28:26,795
I say we should get
the truth out of him

386
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:28,632
the old-fashioned way.

387
00:28:34,680 --> 00:28:35,715
Get down!

388
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:50,794
Come on!

389
00:28:59,480 --> 00:29:00,674
Jake, get on!

390
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:05,070
Come on! Get on, boy!

391
00:29:15,280 --> 00:29:18,078
I can't believe you're real.
You're all real!

392
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:19,798
We have been trying
to tell you.

393
00:29:19,960 --> 00:29:21,188
But I'm special, too.

394
00:29:21,320 --> 00:29:22,355
What?

395
00:29:22,440 --> 00:29:23,998
In the pub.
Olive, you saw.

396
00:29:24,160 --> 00:29:27,277
Right? Everything
was flying and breaking.

397
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:28,440
And that was me!

398
00:29:28,840 --> 00:29:30,876
I was doing it
with my mind.

399
00:29:31,080 --> 00:29:32,911
No, that was me.

400
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:35,200
Millard?

401
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:36,909
Yeah.

402
00:29:37,960 --> 00:29:39,188
Are you naked?

403
00:29:39,280 --> 00:29:40,315
Yeah.

404
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:43,640
Oh.

405
00:29:44,920 --> 00:29:45,955
I don't...

406
00:29:46,680 --> 00:29:49,114
A bomb dropped on you
in 1943.

407
00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:51,637
It is 1943.

408
00:29:51,800 --> 00:29:54,473
September the 3rd, 1943.

409
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:56,358
All day, every day.

410
00:29:56,560 --> 00:29:57,675
It's our loop.

411
00:30:30,560 --> 00:30:31,788
Right on time.

412
00:30:33,040 --> 00:30:34,951
Miss Peregrine.
Delighted to meet you.

413
00:30:36,040 --> 00:30:37,951
I do hope I'm not going
to have the pub landlord

414
00:30:38,040 --> 00:30:39,917
knocking on my door
with the police again.

415
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:41,672
I've had to kill them
twice this month.

416
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:43,592
It's been
terribly inconvenient.

417
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:45,876
Millard broke a few things.
That's all.

418
00:30:46,040 --> 00:30:49,555
And Olive may have
started a tiny fire.

419
00:30:51,520 --> 00:30:53,590
But they were going
to hurt Jake.

420
00:30:57,200 --> 00:30:58,952
Look at you.

421
00:30:59,120 --> 00:31:00,920
The last time dear Abe
sent me a photograph...

422
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:02,956
you were just a tiny tot.

423
00:31:03,400 --> 00:31:04,719
Don't just stand there.
Come in.

424
00:31:04,840 --> 00:31:06,273
Your tea's getting cold.

425
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:10,836
How did you know
about the pub?

426
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:13,036
You weigh approximately
109 pounds, correct?

427
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:14,155
I don't...

428
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:16,600
Bronwyn and the twins returned
6 minutes after you ran away.

429
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:18,039
I think I'm
missing something.

430
00:31:18,200 --> 00:31:19,296
And quite apart
from the fact

431
00:31:19,320 --> 00:31:20,616
that the perceived safety
of the pub...

432
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:22,736
makes it the most likely place
to which you would flee...

433
00:31:22,760 --> 00:31:24,591
it would take you
18 minutes to run there.

434
00:31:24,760 --> 00:31:26,720
Emma and Millard would have
been moments behind...

435
00:31:26,800 --> 00:31:27,869
on the horse and trap,

436
00:31:27,960 --> 00:31:29,678
traveling at 8.2 miles
per hour.

437
00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:31,910
Factoring in some sort
of kerfuffle at the pub...

438
00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:34,196
and the return journey
with your added weight...

439
00:31:34,360 --> 00:31:37,318
you would arrive here
at 13 minutes past 4.

440
00:31:38,200 --> 00:31:40,509
Now, then,
do you take sugar?

441
00:31:41,160 --> 00:31:42,736
That'll do. Thank you, Olive.

442
00:31:42,760 --> 00:31:45,194
Nobody enjoys
over-boiled tea.

443
00:31:55,160 --> 00:31:57,355
Let me help you
with those, Enoch.

444
00:31:57,560 --> 00:32:00,120
Don't bother. Wouldn't want
to interrupt your tea party.

445
00:32:10,280 --> 00:32:12,316
I'm so sorry
for your loss, Jake.

446
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:16,036
You know, then.

447
00:32:17,400 --> 00:32:18,913
I know if Abe were alive,

448
00:32:19,040 --> 00:32:20,678
he would have told me
you were coming.

449
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:26,071
Shall we take
our tea outside?

450
00:32:27,280 --> 00:32:28,280
Thank you.

451
00:32:30,680 --> 00:32:33,478
Before he died,
he told me to find you.

452
00:32:33,680 --> 00:32:35,318
There was something
he wanted me to know.

453
00:32:35,480 --> 00:32:37,038
He said you could
explain everything.

454
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:38,553
That's absolutely true.

455
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:41,029
There are very few things
I can't explain.

456
00:32:42,160 --> 00:32:44,879
We're what's known,
in common parlance,

457
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:46,712
as "peculiar."

458
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:50,312
51 seconds late, Fiona.

459
00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:52,029
Sorry, Miss Peregrine.

460
00:32:52,120 --> 00:32:53,680
How many carrots
do you need for supper?

461
00:32:54,120 --> 00:32:56,190
Just one will do.

462
00:33:10,520 --> 00:33:13,751
As I was saying,
some people are peculiar.

463
00:33:13,920 --> 00:33:16,912
It's a recessive gene
carried down through families.

464
00:33:17,080 --> 00:33:19,071
Yet, many generations
can pass

465
00:33:19,160 --> 00:33:21,549
without a peculiar child
being born.

466
00:33:22,760 --> 00:33:26,912
And alas, peculiars have been
persecuted through the ages.

467
00:33:27,080 --> 00:33:29,196
Hence, we live
in places like this.

468
00:33:30,200 --> 00:33:31,200
In Wales?

469
00:33:31,400 --> 00:33:33,356
Anywhere will do
if you pick the right day.

470
00:33:33,520 --> 00:33:35,078
That's fine now, Fiona.

471
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:42,754
You see, I'm a type of
peculiar called an Ymbryne.

472
00:33:42,920 --> 00:33:44,273
That means I can...

473
00:33:44,440 --> 00:33:45,668
Yeah, you turn into a bird.

474
00:33:45,840 --> 00:33:47,558
I do. Yes.

475
00:33:47,720 --> 00:33:49,438
But that's not very useful.

476
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:52,558
An Ymbryne's main skill
is the manipulation of time.

477
00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:54,790
We choose a safe place,
a safe day...

478
00:33:54,960 --> 00:33:57,076
and create a loop.

479
00:33:57,880 --> 00:33:59,279
What do you mean?

480
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:02,796
A loop preserves
the last 24 hours.

481
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:05,633
Reset the loop, and the day
is yours to live in again.

482
00:34:06,440 --> 00:34:07,555
Reset it daily...

483
00:34:07,720 --> 00:34:09,631
and you can
stay there forever.

484
00:34:09,800 --> 00:34:11,870
Entirely safe
from the outside world.

485
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:14,552
Right on time, Bronwyn.
Good girl.

486
00:34:20,400 --> 00:34:21,958
And that's why we Ymbrynes

487
00:34:22,080 --> 00:34:23,638
are charged with the care
of the young.

488
00:34:27,080 --> 00:34:29,310
And no one ever gets older.

489
00:34:30,160 --> 00:34:32,071
It's best for everyone
this way.

490
00:34:32,160 --> 00:34:33,479
I assure you.

491
00:34:37,320 --> 00:34:38,958
Every Ymbryne
commits herself...

492
00:34:39,120 --> 00:34:41,270
to the creation and upkeep
of a place like this.

493
00:34:42,280 --> 00:34:44,953
A home for peculiar children.

494
00:34:46,840 --> 00:34:48,068
You wanna muck around?

495
00:34:48,240 --> 00:34:49,240
Your bees.

496
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:50,759
Get it!

497
00:34:57,800 --> 00:34:59,279
You met the twins.

498
00:35:05,320 --> 00:35:06,514
This is Claire.

499
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:13,475
Millard, pass the ball.
We're playing together.

500
00:35:18,360 --> 00:35:20,032
Millard you met.

501
00:35:20,680 --> 00:35:21,680
Ugh. Come on!

502
00:35:22,520 --> 00:35:23,839
And that's Hugh.

503
00:35:28,200 --> 00:35:29,872
Stop cheating, Hugh.

504
00:35:30,640 --> 00:35:32,870
Millard,
that's a foul again.

505
00:35:34,200 --> 00:35:36,316
No, it wasn't. Ref?

506
00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:38,711
If you two can't play soccer
without squabbling...

507
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:40,393
I do wish
you wouldn't play at all.

508
00:35:40,560 --> 00:35:41,720
Do you know
what a referee is?

509
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:44,632
Good afternoon.
I'm Horace.

510
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:45,800
Delighted to meet you.

511
00:35:45,960 --> 00:35:47,075
Ow!

512
00:35:47,240 --> 00:35:48,240
Careful!

513
00:35:48,360 --> 00:35:49,873
We sorely need
some new blood here.

514
00:35:51,240 --> 00:35:52,309
Super shirt, by the way.

515
00:35:53,640 --> 00:35:54,640
Thanks.

516
00:35:54,840 --> 00:35:56,512
Try harder.

517
00:35:59,400 --> 00:36:00,913
You know Emma, of course.

518
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:03,752
And I think that's everyone.

519
00:36:04,360 --> 00:36:06,669
Didn't Bronwyn
have a brother?

520
00:36:07,560 --> 00:36:09,596
Yes. Victor's upstairs.

521
00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:11,120
Wait, where did Enoch
and Olive go?

522
00:36:11,880 --> 00:36:13,029
Heaven knows.

523
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:15,560
Enoch's been off sulking ever
since we went out to get Jake.

524
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:17,176
Miss Peregrine, there's
a policeman at the door.

525
00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:18,599
He says it's about the pub!

526
00:36:21,080 --> 00:36:22,752
We'll discuss this
later, Emma.

527
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:26,872
It wasn't their fault.

528
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:30,275
Honestly, they were
just trying to help.

529
00:36:34,600 --> 00:36:35,715
Hmm.

530
00:36:40,240 --> 00:36:41,434
Thanks.

531
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:43,431
You're not as wet
as I thought.

532
00:36:46,440 --> 00:36:50,035
She's not really gonna
kill anyone, is she?

533
00:36:50,200 --> 00:36:52,270
Not if she can
talk her way out of it.

534
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:54,118
Would you help me
with something?

535
00:36:54,280 --> 00:36:55,952
Enoch usually does it,
but like I said,

536
00:36:56,080 --> 00:36:57,399
he's off sulking somewhere.

537
00:36:58,640 --> 00:37:00,198
Is that because of me?

538
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:02,960
He's possessive.

539
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:07,236
So, what did you
need help with?

540
00:37:08,040 --> 00:37:09,439
One of my daily chores.

541
00:37:09,600 --> 00:37:11,989
Put the baby squirrel
back in the tree.

542
00:37:12,160 --> 00:37:13,309
What baby squirrel?

543
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:20,839
That happens every day?

544
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:22,274
Like clockwork.

545
00:37:23,160 --> 00:37:25,200
Now, would you mind tying
that rope around my waist?

546
00:37:26,920 --> 00:37:27,955
Uh, yeah.

547
00:37:56,320 --> 00:37:58,436
Right. Promise to
hold on tight.

548
00:38:43,240 --> 00:38:45,071
I nearly messed that up.

549
00:38:46,520 --> 00:38:49,034
Abe did, too, the first time.

550
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:50,918
This used to be his job.

551
00:38:53,200 --> 00:38:56,590
Emma, I need to
tell you something.

552
00:38:57,760 --> 00:38:58,909
He's dead.

553
00:39:00,560 --> 00:39:01,709
I know.

554
00:39:01,880 --> 00:39:04,440
Miss Peregrine guessed,
and she's always right.

555
00:39:05,920 --> 00:39:06,920
It's okay.

556
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:09,910
I said goodbye to him
a long time ago.

557
00:39:10,680 --> 00:39:12,193
Were you close?

558
00:39:14,600 --> 00:39:16,238
I thought we were.

559
00:39:17,240 --> 00:39:18,958
For a while.

560
00:39:19,120 --> 00:39:20,758
But I suppose not.

561
00:39:23,120 --> 00:39:25,918
Can I ask, was he like you?

562
00:39:29,080 --> 00:39:30,718
He was like you, Jake.

563
00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:34,838
I need to go
and change for supper.

564
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:36,634
Will you be dining with us?

565
00:39:37,080 --> 00:39:38,957
I can't stay out late.

566
00:39:39,120 --> 00:39:40,758
Supper's at 5:30.

567
00:39:41,960 --> 00:39:44,110
Uh... That
is pretty early.

568
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:46,392
The fact we're not
all eight years old

569
00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:48,118
seems to have eluded
Miss Peregrine.

570
00:39:49,240 --> 00:39:51,117
You can borrow
some of Abe's clothes.

571
00:39:51,320 --> 00:39:53,311
His room's in the attic.

572
00:40:03,640 --> 00:40:04,640
Jake!

573
00:40:05,160 --> 00:40:06,559
Come and meet Enoch properly.

574
00:40:17,640 --> 00:40:19,835
You must feel
pretty out of place.

575
00:40:21,680 --> 00:40:22,954
Don't worry.

576
00:40:23,520 --> 00:40:25,272
I'm used to it.

577
00:40:25,480 --> 00:40:26,629
No. I wasn't worried.

578
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:29,519
Some advice for you though,
man to man.

579
00:40:29,680 --> 00:40:32,000
If you're thinking of staying
just because you like Emma...

580
00:40:32,360 --> 00:40:33,360
don't bother.

581
00:40:33,520 --> 00:40:35,829
You see, she swore off
romance decades ago...

582
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:37,319
when she got
her heart broken.

583
00:40:38,200 --> 00:40:41,033
And she's never gonna
change her mind. So...

584
00:40:44,320 --> 00:40:45,958
Enoch, I wasn't...

585
00:40:47,880 --> 00:40:48,880
What are you doing?

586
00:41:19,680 --> 00:41:20,795
Isn't he amazing?

587
00:41:21,320 --> 00:41:22,389
What did you do?

588
00:41:23,080 --> 00:41:24,479
This?

589
00:41:24,880 --> 00:41:27,155
Jake, this isn't
even the fun part.

590
00:41:27,680 --> 00:41:28,920
Do you want to see
the fun part?

591
00:41:53,840 --> 00:41:54,989
They're like puppets.

592
00:41:55,200 --> 00:41:57,589
Just do anything I tell them.

593
00:41:59,840 --> 00:42:01,592
It's even more fun
with people.

594
00:42:01,760 --> 00:42:02,880
You should have seen some of

595
00:42:02,920 --> 00:42:04,399
the epic battles
they used to have...

596
00:42:04,560 --> 00:42:05,879
at my parents'
funeral parlor.

597
00:42:09,240 --> 00:42:10,434
You'll need a necktie.

598
00:42:19,720 --> 00:42:22,632
So what did my grandpa do
when he was traveling?

599
00:42:23,400 --> 00:42:25,197
Visited other loops.

600
00:42:25,800 --> 00:42:28,234
Really? To do what?

601
00:42:29,120 --> 00:42:30,633
Jake, there's some questions

602
00:42:30,720 --> 00:42:32,711
that I can't answer,
all right?

603
00:42:32,880 --> 00:42:34,916
So, it would be a lot easier
for me if you just...

604
00:42:35,800 --> 00:42:37,119
stopped asking them.

605
00:42:56,960 --> 00:42:58,056
Hey!
What are you doing?

606
00:42:58,080 --> 00:42:59,080
Millard.

607
00:42:59,240 --> 00:43:01,071
Go and put some clothes on.

608
00:43:01,240 --> 00:43:03,310
Polite persons do not take
their supper in the nude.

609
00:43:03,480 --> 00:43:05,516
All right. All right.

610
00:43:08,680 --> 00:43:10,591
You can sit here, Jake.

611
00:43:12,840 --> 00:43:13,840
Look at Enoch.

612
00:43:14,600 --> 00:43:15,669
He's jealous.

613
00:43:16,120 --> 00:43:17,838
Why would I be jealous?

614
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:19,956
Olive can go marry Jake,
for all I care.

615
00:43:20,120 --> 00:43:22,509
Don't be mean, Enoch.
She doesn't want to.

616
00:43:22,680 --> 00:43:24,591
She's just excited
to have a visitor.

617
00:43:24,760 --> 00:43:26,512
Nobody is marrying anybody.

618
00:43:26,680 --> 00:43:28,432
Now, eat up your food
before it gets cold.

619
00:43:33,320 --> 00:43:34,355
Hugh!

620
00:43:35,520 --> 00:43:37,317
Where's your net?

621
00:43:37,840 --> 00:43:40,035
Hugh! You have to
stop doing this, Hugh.

622
00:43:43,440 --> 00:43:45,192
Go away!

623
00:43:50,720 --> 00:43:52,631
Must be very strange
for you, Jake.

624
00:43:53,040 --> 00:43:54,951
Meeting your
grandfather's friends.

625
00:43:55,120 --> 00:43:56,712
Visiting another century.

626
00:43:56,880 --> 00:43:58,720
Are there spaceships
in your time, Jake?

627
00:43:58,880 --> 00:44:00,313
Like the Flash Gordon books.

628
00:44:00,560 --> 00:44:01,560
Now, now, Olive.

629
00:44:01,720 --> 00:44:03,392
What did I say
about asking questions?

630
00:44:04,240 --> 00:44:05,719
We don't discuss
the future here.

631
00:44:05,880 --> 00:44:08,394
We enjoy living in the
good old here and now.

632
00:44:11,680 --> 00:44:12,880
Claire, why aren't you eating?

633
00:44:14,320 --> 00:44:15,992
She's embarrassed
in front of Jake.

634
00:44:16,160 --> 00:44:17,718
Don't be. Please.

635
00:44:35,600 --> 00:44:37,830
So, Jake,
what's your peculiarity?

636
00:44:38,760 --> 00:44:40,591
Oh, I'm not peculiar.

637
00:44:40,760 --> 00:44:41,909
And that, my friends,

638
00:44:42,040 --> 00:44:43,837
is why he will not
be staying with us...

639
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:46,434
no matter how hard
we try to persuade him.

640
00:44:46,600 --> 00:44:49,194
We've spoken about this.
Jake is just visiting.

641
00:44:49,360 --> 00:44:50,588
He might want to stay.

642
00:44:50,760 --> 00:44:52,512
Don't you want
to stay, Jake?

643
00:44:52,960 --> 00:44:54,393
Tonight? Or...

644
00:44:54,560 --> 00:44:56,676
Forever. You should
stay forever.

645
00:44:56,880 --> 00:44:59,189
Why would he,
if he doesn't have to?

646
00:44:59,360 --> 00:45:01,396
He can live out there,
grow older...

647
00:45:01,560 --> 00:45:03,073
have a good time instead.

648
00:45:03,240 --> 00:45:05,800
He'll leave, just like
his grandfather did.

649
00:45:11,120 --> 00:45:12,120
Emma!

650
00:45:12,280 --> 00:45:13,474
Excuse me.

651
00:45:13,640 --> 00:45:14,640
Where's she going?

652
00:45:14,800 --> 00:45:15,949
That wasn't nice, Enoch.

653
00:45:16,080 --> 00:45:18,640
You know perfectly well
why Abe left us.

654
00:45:18,800 --> 00:45:19,800
To join the army.

655
00:45:19,960 --> 00:45:22,474
And then he met a lady,
and had a nice wedding cake...

656
00:45:22,640 --> 00:45:24,312
and a lovely little baby.

657
00:45:24,400 --> 00:45:25,400
Children.

658
00:45:27,320 --> 00:45:29,629
I know you'd all
like a new friend...

659
00:45:29,800 --> 00:45:33,156
but I'm sure Jake has plenty
of his own back in Florida.

660
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:37,911
I think you should
all get ready

661
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:40,389
for movie time
while I answer that.

662
00:45:40,560 --> 00:45:42,551
But you always
let us stay for it.

663
00:46:01,640 --> 00:46:03,119
Hello, this is Abe.

664
00:46:03,800 --> 00:46:05,472
How is everyone?

665
00:46:12,360 --> 00:46:14,080
Yours has extra
marshmallows, Jake.

666
00:46:14,160 --> 00:46:16,435
Millard, put
some pajamas on.

667
00:46:16,600 --> 00:46:17,953
It's
too hot in here.

668
00:46:18,120 --> 00:46:19,314
Stop moaning.

669
00:46:19,480 --> 00:46:20,560
Excuse me.

670
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:31,355
My grandpa
told me about this.

671
00:46:31,520 --> 00:46:33,875
Horace projects
his dreams, right?

672
00:46:34,040 --> 00:46:35,473
He used to listen
to the radio.

673
00:46:35,640 --> 00:46:38,359
Gets tedious when you know
every word off by heart.

674
00:46:42,480 --> 00:46:44,198
Splendid. I'll take it.

675
00:46:44,400 --> 00:46:45,879
He dreams
about clothes mostly.

676
00:46:46,040 --> 00:46:47,234
Delighted to meet you.

677
00:46:48,880 --> 00:46:50,836
Super shirt, by the way.

678
00:46:53,400 --> 00:46:55,231
When did he dream this?

679
00:46:55,400 --> 00:46:56,674
Last night.

680
00:46:56,840 --> 00:46:58,398
Some of his dreams
are prophetic.

681
00:46:58,560 --> 00:47:00,790
But, mostly
they're about clothes.

682
00:47:02,080 --> 00:47:05,231
Prophetic as in,
he can see into the future?

683
00:47:19,760 --> 00:47:21,432
An Ymbryne. Who is she?

684
00:47:21,600 --> 00:47:23,238
Miss Peregrine,
do you know her?

685
00:47:23,440 --> 00:47:24,440
Don't be silly.

686
00:47:24,600 --> 00:47:26,750
Horace must have just had a bad dream.
That's all.

687
00:47:59,240 --> 00:48:00,559
Aw!

688
00:48:01,480 --> 00:48:03,320
That's quite enough of that.
Thank you, Horace.

689
00:48:03,920 --> 00:48:05,592
I should probably
get going.

690
00:48:06,480 --> 00:48:08,869
You could stay the night,
if you wanted to.

691
00:48:09,040 --> 00:48:10,951
Rather than walk home
alone in the dark.

692
00:48:11,120 --> 00:48:14,317
But the island
is very safe, isn't it?

693
00:48:14,480 --> 00:48:15,708
Of course!

694
00:48:15,880 --> 00:48:18,474
I only meant the path
is dreadfully bumpy.

695
00:48:18,640 --> 00:48:19,789
Jake could trip.

696
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:21,718
Perhaps you could show him
the shortcuts.

697
00:48:21,880 --> 00:48:24,758
Should he ever need
to avoid bumps.

698
00:48:25,160 --> 00:48:27,000
Won't you at least
stay to see the reset, Jake?

699
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:29,136
It's really
quite spectacular.

700
00:48:29,160 --> 00:48:30,957
Yeah!
Stay, Jake!

701
00:48:38,840 --> 00:48:40,273
Come on, Jake!

702
00:49:02,520 --> 00:49:05,273
Run, rabbit, run, rabbit

703
00:49:05,360 --> 00:49:06,873
Run, run, run

704
00:49:08,120 --> 00:49:11,954
Don't give the farmer
his fun, fun, fun

705
00:49:13,520 --> 00:49:17,991
He'll get by
without his rabbit pie

706
00:49:18,440 --> 00:49:23,355
So run, rabbit, run, rabbit,
run, run, run

707
00:50:16,080 --> 00:50:18,389
Run, rabbit, run, rabbit...

708
00:50:18,480 --> 00:50:22,439
Bang, bang, bang, bang
goes the farmer's gun

709
00:50:24,800 --> 00:50:27,712
Don't give the farmer
his fun, fun, fun

710
00:50:30,120 --> 00:50:33,430
He'll get by
without his rabbit pie

711
00:50:33,560 --> 00:50:35,198
That was fantastic.

712
00:51:12,840 --> 00:51:13,989
What was that?

713
00:51:14,160 --> 00:51:15,832
It was my phone.

714
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:18,753
It's been dead the whole time in the loop.
I guess now...

715
00:51:18,920 --> 00:51:20,239
Your phone?

716
00:51:20,920 --> 00:51:23,480
Yeah. Like a telephone.

717
00:51:23,680 --> 00:51:25,989
You can call people...

718
00:51:26,160 --> 00:51:28,151
send written messages.

719
00:51:28,320 --> 00:51:30,151
Wait, you'll love this.

720
00:51:30,320 --> 00:51:31,912
You can take a picture.

721
00:51:32,080 --> 00:51:34,355
Press that, there. Yeah.

722
00:51:35,920 --> 00:51:36,989
See?

723
00:51:44,160 --> 00:51:45,639
What's wrong?

724
00:51:48,280 --> 00:51:51,670
It's just funny to think
that one day, you'll grow up.

725
00:51:51,840 --> 00:51:53,034
Like Abe did.

726
00:51:53,760 --> 00:51:56,354
Get married, have children.

727
00:51:56,520 --> 00:51:57,669
Grandchildren.

728
00:51:58,440 --> 00:52:00,590
You might even show them
this photograph.

729
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:03,479
And I'll still be here.

730
00:52:05,400 --> 00:52:07,595
Couldn't you leave
some day?

731
00:52:07,760 --> 00:52:10,513
And live in the present,
if you wanted to?

732
00:52:10,680 --> 00:52:11,680
No.

733
00:52:12,120 --> 00:52:13,496
More than a few minutes
in your time

734
00:52:13,520 --> 00:52:15,158
and the years
would catch up.

735
00:52:16,600 --> 00:52:18,079
You would age?

736
00:52:26,680 --> 00:52:28,750
I think it's the Ymbryne
from Horace's dream.

737
00:52:29,240 --> 00:52:31,993
Are you sure
it's not just a bird?

738
00:52:32,240 --> 00:52:33,673
I don't know,
wouldn't it change?

739
00:52:33,840 --> 00:52:36,070
She can't.
Not if she's hurt.

740
00:52:37,080 --> 00:52:39,753
I need to take her inside.
You should go.

741
00:52:43,240 --> 00:52:44,673
Please don't say
anything else.

742
00:52:44,760 --> 00:52:46,318
I hate goodbyes.

743
00:52:49,240 --> 00:52:50,240
I'll come back tomorrow.

744
00:52:51,520 --> 00:52:54,830
There's no hurry.
I'll be here forever.

745
00:53:02,440 --> 00:53:03,440
Hey!

746
00:53:05,560 --> 00:53:06,736
I've been all over
this damn island.

747
00:53:06,760 --> 00:53:07,875
Where the hell were you?

748
00:53:08,080 --> 00:53:10,116
Um, I was just
on my way back.

749
00:53:10,280 --> 00:53:11,918
I'm sorry.
I lost track of time.

750
00:53:12,960 --> 00:53:15,428
I was having a blast
with Worm and Dirty D.

751
00:53:16,360 --> 00:53:17,429
Dirty D?

752
00:53:18,520 --> 00:53:19,714
You know what?

753
00:53:19,920 --> 00:53:22,070
This is good.
This is healthy.

754
00:53:22,240 --> 00:53:23,912
You're making
weird friends...

755
00:53:24,960 --> 00:53:26,951
and doing teenage stuff.

756
00:53:27,120 --> 00:53:28,120
I think this is normal.

757
00:53:28,240 --> 00:53:29,719
I'm sure Doctor Golan
will approve.

758
00:53:29,880 --> 00:53:31,598
Hey, you.
American!

759
00:53:31,760 --> 00:53:32,954
Get over here.

760
00:53:34,880 --> 00:53:35,949
Oh, look.
There they are.

761
00:53:36,120 --> 00:53:39,317
There's D-Bag
and Worm Man.

762
00:53:39,480 --> 00:53:40,595
Did you do this?

763
00:53:42,080 --> 00:53:44,310
What? No.

764
00:53:44,920 --> 00:53:45,955
Of course not.

765
00:53:46,480 --> 00:53:47,595
It wasn't us.

766
00:53:48,240 --> 00:53:49,936
Listen, sir. I don't know
what happened here.

767
00:53:49,960 --> 00:53:52,997
But my son and his friends
have been together all day.

768
00:53:53,160 --> 00:53:55,435
Jake would never
do anything like this.

769
00:53:55,600 --> 00:53:57,113
Bollocks!
We haven't seen him!

770
00:53:57,280 --> 00:53:58,395
You paid us yesterday.

771
00:53:58,480 --> 00:54:00,311
Why would we hang out
with him today for free?

772
00:54:03,160 --> 00:54:06,152
Jake? Were you with
them or not?

773
00:54:07,520 --> 00:54:09,636
No. I'm sorry.

774
00:54:10,640 --> 00:54:12,471
But you don't seriously
think I could do this?

775
00:54:13,720 --> 00:54:15,312
I think we're
done here, sir.

776
00:54:16,840 --> 00:54:18,990
Can you pass on
a message for me?

777
00:54:19,160 --> 00:54:21,151
Can you tell
Doctor Golan...

778
00:54:21,360 --> 00:54:23,715
that if she hadn't encouraged
this cockamamie trip...

779
00:54:23,880 --> 00:54:25,029
maybe my son wouldn't be

780
00:54:25,160 --> 00:54:26,856
moping around all day
in a derelict house...

781
00:54:26,880 --> 00:54:28,711
having a
goddamn breakdown!

782
00:54:29,680 --> 00:54:30,829
Hello?

783
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:32,513
Dad, I'm not.

784
00:54:33,320 --> 00:54:34,320
I'm fine.

785
00:54:34,480 --> 00:54:36,198
No. You're not.

786
00:54:37,320 --> 00:54:39,311
You're not fine, Jake.

787
00:54:40,360 --> 00:54:42,999
Coming here was a
terrible, terrible idea.

788
00:54:43,680 --> 00:54:45,636
Look, I'm sorry I lied.
I just wanted...

789
00:54:45,840 --> 00:54:48,308
Just set your alarm
for 8:00 a.m.

790
00:54:48,760 --> 00:54:50,716
I wanna get
to the beach early.

791
00:54:50,880 --> 00:54:51,976
The rest of the time
we're stuck

792
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:53,149
on this craphole island...

793
00:54:53,320 --> 00:54:54,719
we're sticking together.

794
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:57,035
Where are you going?

795
00:54:57,200 --> 00:54:59,236
Downstairs for a drink.

796
00:55:48,120 --> 00:55:49,200
Dear Miss Peregrine...

797
00:55:49,720 --> 00:55:51,392
I don't wish to alarm you...

798
00:55:51,560 --> 00:55:54,120
but one of my informants
sent me this.

799
00:55:54,880 --> 00:55:57,394
It would appear that some
of Mr. Barron's group...

800
00:55:57,560 --> 00:55:59,391
are in Blackpool, England.

801
00:56:00,600 --> 00:56:01,953
If I recall...

802
00:56:02,120 --> 00:56:04,429
Miss Avocet has a loop there.

803
00:56:05,080 --> 00:56:06,991
Please warn her and suggest...

804
00:56:07,160 --> 00:56:08,991
that she make a new one
right away...

805
00:56:09,160 --> 00:56:10,275
well-hidden.

806
00:56:10,440 --> 00:56:13,000
And take
the greatest care yourself.

807
00:56:13,160 --> 00:56:14,912
With love, Abe.

808
00:56:15,080 --> 00:56:17,071
January, 2016.

809
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:37,513
Who's ready
to hit the beach?

810
00:56:37,640 --> 00:56:38,914
Ugh.

811
00:56:44,200 --> 00:56:45,679
Oh, my...

812
00:56:46,360 --> 00:56:47,360
Unbelievable.

813
00:56:49,160 --> 00:56:51,037
Right in the middle
of a nesting area?

814
00:56:51,200 --> 00:56:53,475
What kind of idiot
does that?

815
00:56:54,840 --> 00:56:57,673
Actually, the main
nesting area is over there.

816
00:56:58,280 --> 00:56:59,838
I can show you
if you'd like.

817
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:02,195
It's marvelous to meet
a fellow bird spotter.

818
00:57:02,320 --> 00:57:03,355
John Lamont.

819
00:57:03,560 --> 00:57:05,630
Franklin Portman.
This is my son, Jake.

820
00:57:06,360 --> 00:57:07,509
John Lamont.

821
00:57:07,680 --> 00:57:09,240
That's a hell of a camera
you got there.

822
00:57:10,040 --> 00:57:12,679
Oh, thanks.
It's absolutely fantastic.

823
00:57:12,840 --> 00:57:16,196
I'm here to do some snaps
for a book I'm writing.

824
00:57:16,360 --> 00:57:18,191
So, you gentlemen here
on holiday?

825
00:57:21,640 --> 00:57:24,154
Unfortunately,
her wings were flapping

826
00:57:24,240 --> 00:57:25,275
as much as the bird's!

827
00:57:27,480 --> 00:57:28,560
I think you fellas are

828
00:57:28,640 --> 00:57:29,856
thinking of another kind
of bird.

829
00:57:29,880 --> 00:57:31,440
So, you're not going
to the beach today?

830
00:57:32,040 --> 00:57:33,359
What's the point?

831
00:57:33,520 --> 00:57:35,112
If that guy is gonna
cover Cairnholm

832
00:57:35,200 --> 00:57:36,679
in some big, glossy book...

833
00:57:36,840 --> 00:57:38,478
no one's gonna even
wanna look at mine.

834
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:41,911
Might just have
a nice afternoon nap.

835
00:57:42,760 --> 00:57:44,273
I don't suppose
you saw Uncle Oggie

836
00:57:44,360 --> 00:57:46,191
on your travels
this morning, did you?

837
00:57:46,400 --> 00:57:47,913
He's usually here by now.

838
00:57:48,080 --> 00:57:49,195
I could go look for him.

839
00:57:49,920 --> 00:57:51,399
You're not going anywhere.

840
00:58:27,080 --> 00:58:29,435
Jake, you're back!
Come and play!

841
00:58:30,600 --> 00:58:31,600
Oh!

842
00:58:34,120 --> 00:58:36,076
I need to see
Miss Peregrine first.

843
00:58:36,240 --> 00:58:37,593
Do you know where she is?

844
00:58:37,760 --> 00:58:39,416
From the darkest days,

845
00:58:39,440 --> 00:58:40,589
the Canadian army...

846
00:58:42,920 --> 00:58:45,559
Jake. You're back.
How wonderful!

847
00:58:46,280 --> 00:58:47,280
How's it doing?

848
00:58:47,920 --> 00:58:49,239
Emma said it was an Ymbryne.

849
00:58:49,800 --> 00:58:51,233
"She." Not "it."

850
00:58:51,400 --> 00:58:53,277
Ymbrynes are
always female.

851
00:58:53,440 --> 00:58:54,839
And Emma was quite correct.

852
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:56,592
This is Miss Avocet.

853
00:58:56,800 --> 00:58:59,553
Her loop's in Blackpool.
England.

854
00:59:02,280 --> 00:59:04,430
That was a
private letter, Jake.

855
00:59:07,160 --> 00:59:08,639
Who is Mr. Barron?

856
00:59:11,640 --> 00:59:13,073
Miss Peregrine,
if my Grandpa

857
00:59:13,160 --> 00:59:15,116
was involved
with dangerous people...

858
00:59:15,320 --> 00:59:16,833
I need to tell the police.

859
00:59:18,120 --> 00:59:19,120
Police?

860
00:59:20,320 --> 00:59:22,675
Are you implying Abe
died an unnatural death?

861
00:59:23,200 --> 00:59:24,792
I found him in the woods...

862
00:59:24,960 --> 00:59:26,996
with his eyes missing.

863
00:59:27,160 --> 00:59:28,991
I'd say that was
pretty unnatural.

864
00:59:33,640 --> 00:59:36,837
Unless essential, I don't
discuss unpleasant matters.

865
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:39,468
An Ymbryne's duty is to
protect children, Jake.

866
00:59:40,680 --> 00:59:42,272
I'm not a child.

867
00:59:43,320 --> 00:59:45,880
He wanted you
to tell me everything!

868
00:59:50,880 --> 00:59:52,836
Oh. How frustrating
for you.

869
00:59:53,360 --> 00:59:54,713
Between Miss Peregrine's
rules...

870
00:59:54,880 --> 00:59:57,000
and my housemates' little
pact not to scare you off...

871
00:59:57,040 --> 00:59:59,156
it's like no one's
telling you anything!

872
01:00:00,520 --> 01:00:02,317
Why don't you, then?

873
01:00:02,400 --> 01:00:03,833
It's not like
you want me here.

874
01:00:04,360 --> 01:00:06,828
Enoch, you can't.
You promised.

875
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:09,194
Olive's right.

876
01:00:10,040 --> 01:00:11,336
I do know someone
who can get away

877
01:00:11,360 --> 01:00:12,713
with breaking rules though.

878
01:00:13,360 --> 01:00:14,634
Want to meet him?

879
01:00:16,080 --> 01:00:18,640
Enoch, don't
do this. Please!

880
01:00:18,840 --> 01:00:20,176
You want to spend time
with me and Jake,

881
01:00:20,200 --> 01:00:21,349
we can all play together.

882
01:00:21,520 --> 01:00:22,839
That's what you said.

883
01:00:24,200 --> 01:00:25,918
Here we all are.

884
01:00:27,200 --> 01:00:28,872
Move, Olive.

885
01:00:29,040 --> 01:00:30,280
If you're going
to be like that,

886
01:00:30,360 --> 01:00:32,669
then I don't want
to be your friend.

887
01:00:35,440 --> 01:00:39,399
Enoch, leave Victor alone.
It really upsets Bronwyn.

888
01:00:39,560 --> 01:00:41,357
Stop fussing, Fiona.

889
01:00:41,440 --> 01:00:43,120
Don't you think Jake
should meet everybody?

890
01:00:43,240 --> 01:00:44,760
He's trying to frighten
you away, Jake.

891
01:00:44,880 --> 01:00:47,678
He was always jealous of Abe.
And now he's jealous of you.

892
01:00:47,840 --> 01:00:49,239
Come and play
with us instead.

893
01:00:53,440 --> 01:00:56,273
I'd quite like
to meet Victor.

894
01:01:02,880 --> 01:01:04,074
After you.

895
01:01:12,600 --> 01:01:13,635
Hello, Victor.

896
01:01:14,760 --> 01:01:17,877
I'm Jake.
I'm sorry to disturb...

897
01:01:21,560 --> 01:01:22,788
Yeah, he can't hear you.

898
01:01:48,280 --> 01:01:50,157
Hello, Jake. I'm Victor.

899
01:01:50,280 --> 01:01:51,679
Do you want to know
what killed me?

900
01:01:59,640 --> 01:02:01,471
There you are.
Is Enoch with you?

901
01:02:01,600 --> 01:02:03,079
It's time for
our daily walk.

902
01:02:06,080 --> 01:02:08,469
Emma, who killed Victor?

903
01:02:08,640 --> 01:02:10,312
Was it the people
with the white eyes?

904
01:02:10,480 --> 01:02:12,118
I asked you
not to ask questions.

905
01:02:12,280 --> 01:02:15,272
I saw one the night
my grandpa died.

906
01:02:15,440 --> 01:02:16,475
A man.

907
01:02:18,440 --> 01:02:19,475
If it really was one,

908
01:02:19,600 --> 01:02:21,192
you have to
tell Miss Peregrine.

909
01:02:21,360 --> 01:02:23,476
Could you recognize him
from a photograph?

910
01:02:23,640 --> 01:02:25,039
Do you have one?

911
01:02:26,360 --> 01:02:28,316
Come on. There's somewhere
I go to be alone.

912
01:02:28,440 --> 01:02:29,873
I have things there.

913
01:03:07,240 --> 01:03:08,514
Is this the place?

914
01:03:08,720 --> 01:03:10,870
No. This is how we get there.

915
01:03:30,400 --> 01:03:32,231
Oh! Emma! Your shoes!

916
01:03:32,400 --> 01:03:33,833
Lead shoes!

917
01:05:35,840 --> 01:05:37,353
Welcome to my
secret hideout.

918
01:05:39,720 --> 01:05:41,472
How did you...

919
01:05:41,560 --> 01:05:42,629
Air.

920
01:05:43,360 --> 01:05:44,998
It's my peculiarity.

921
01:05:45,640 --> 01:05:47,517
It does what I want.

922
01:06:06,560 --> 01:06:07,754
Jake...

923
01:06:07,920 --> 01:06:09,558
before your
grandfather retired...

924
01:06:09,720 --> 01:06:11,870
he asked me
to keep this safe.

925
01:06:30,040 --> 01:06:31,359
This is my grandpa's
old map.

926
01:06:31,520 --> 01:06:33,078
It shows you
where the loops are.

927
01:06:44,360 --> 01:06:45,918
That's him!

928
01:06:46,080 --> 01:06:47,752
That's the man I saw.

929
01:06:48,200 --> 01:06:49,918
Who is he?
That's Barron.

930
01:06:50,080 --> 01:06:51,080
He's the leader.

931
01:06:52,400 --> 01:06:53,753
The leader of what?

932
01:06:54,600 --> 01:06:55,794
Who are these people?

933
01:06:57,080 --> 01:06:59,913
Bad people. Bad peculiars.

934
01:07:00,720 --> 01:07:03,598
Abe dedicated his life
to hunting them down.

935
01:07:03,760 --> 01:07:05,591
These are the ones
he never found.

936
01:07:06,440 --> 01:07:08,271
What do you mean, hunting?

937
01:07:11,280 --> 01:07:13,077
They raided loops.

938
01:07:13,240 --> 01:07:16,630
Whole homes full of children
left for dead.

939
01:07:17,120 --> 01:07:19,315
Abe took lives
to save lives.

940
01:07:19,480 --> 01:07:22,313
He only retired when you were
born to protect you.

941
01:07:23,400 --> 01:07:24,469
From what?

942
01:07:28,600 --> 01:07:29,669
If I tell you the rest,

943
01:07:29,800 --> 01:07:31,836
you have to promise
not to run away.

944
01:07:33,080 --> 01:07:36,117
Jake, you belong here.

945
01:07:36,320 --> 01:07:37,673
You know I don't.

946
01:07:37,840 --> 01:07:39,796
I'm not like you.

947
01:07:40,480 --> 01:07:41,754
I'm just ordinary.

948
01:07:41,920 --> 01:07:43,273
No, you're not.

949
01:07:43,440 --> 01:07:44,475
Jake...

950
01:07:44,640 --> 01:07:47,518
only a peculiar
can enter a time loop.

951
01:07:50,160 --> 01:07:52,151
No. That can't be right.

952
01:07:52,800 --> 01:07:54,199
I would know.

953
01:07:55,160 --> 01:07:56,160
Fine.

954
01:07:58,160 --> 01:07:59,832
Then I'll show you
something else.

955
01:08:07,320 --> 01:08:08,469
Hurry. You'll miss it.

956
01:08:22,320 --> 01:08:25,676
Ymbrynes usually pick the
perfect day to create a loop.

957
01:08:25,840 --> 01:08:27,800
But Miss Peregrine had to
make this one in a rush.

958
01:08:29,080 --> 01:08:30,080
Why?

959
01:08:30,720 --> 01:08:32,896
Because the Germans were about
to drop a bomb on the house.

960
01:08:32,920 --> 01:08:34,353
The point is...

961
01:08:34,520 --> 01:08:37,353
September the 3rd, 1943
wasn't perfect.

962
01:08:38,680 --> 01:08:40,910
The thing that killed
Victor came back.

963
01:09:08,080 --> 01:09:09,115
Wait! Watch out!

964
01:09:09,880 --> 01:09:11,108
You'll put her off!

965
01:09:39,640 --> 01:09:41,392
You can see it, can't you?

966
01:09:41,920 --> 01:09:43,433
No one else can.

967
01:09:43,920 --> 01:09:46,070
It's invisible, Jake.

968
01:09:46,280 --> 01:09:47,680
That was Abe's
greatest gift of all.

969
01:09:50,880 --> 01:09:52,438
He could see the monsters.

970
01:09:57,760 --> 01:09:59,751
We call them Hollowgast.

971
01:09:59,960 --> 01:10:01,109
Hollows for short.

972
01:10:01,960 --> 01:10:05,919
My grandpa told me about
people who turn into monsters.

973
01:10:06,080 --> 01:10:07,433
Is that what they are?

974
01:10:08,400 --> 01:10:10,436
I will explain
everything, Jake.

975
01:10:10,640 --> 01:10:12,756
I fear it's my duty now,
considering.

976
01:10:12,920 --> 01:10:13,976
But you should know
that in doing so,

977
01:10:14,000 --> 01:10:15,160
I'm breaking
a solemn promise.

978
01:10:18,000 --> 01:10:19,956
I knew you were peculiar
when you were born.

979
01:10:20,480 --> 01:10:22,835
But your grandfather forbid
me to tell you anything.

980
01:10:23,000 --> 01:10:26,310
His dearest wish was for you
to have an ordinary childhood.

981
01:10:26,840 --> 01:10:28,637
I definitely had that.

982
01:10:28,800 --> 01:10:31,314
He intended to tell you the
truth when you turned 18.

983
01:10:31,840 --> 01:10:36,311
He hoped his bedtime stories
would pave the way.

984
01:10:37,000 --> 01:10:38,035
Ah.

985
01:10:38,160 --> 01:10:39,513
Here's my book.

986
01:10:50,880 --> 01:10:52,359
Many years ago...

987
01:10:53,040 --> 01:10:55,793
a splinter faction emerged
among our people.

988
01:10:55,960 --> 01:10:58,520
Disaffected peculiars
tired of living in loops.

989
01:10:59,200 --> 01:11:01,634
That's Mr. Barron.

990
01:11:01,800 --> 01:11:03,836
He believed that
by harnessing the essence

991
01:11:03,960 --> 01:11:05,552
of an Ymbryne's powers...

992
01:11:05,720 --> 01:11:08,473
he and his cronies
could gain immortality...

993
01:11:08,640 --> 01:11:10,995
and be able
to live outside loops.

994
01:11:11,200 --> 01:11:13,316
He devised an experiment.

995
01:11:16,480 --> 01:11:18,311
He kidnapped an Ymbryne...

996
01:11:18,400 --> 01:11:19,400
not knowing or caring

997
01:11:19,520 --> 01:11:21,351
whether she would survive
the experiment.

998
01:11:42,680 --> 01:11:44,796
But the fate of Barron
and his group

999
01:11:44,880 --> 01:11:46,279
was more horrifying still.

1000
01:12:23,600 --> 01:12:25,909
Why didn't Barron
turn into one?

1001
01:12:39,400 --> 01:12:40,799
He did.

1002
01:12:41,000 --> 01:12:42,592
But years later...

1003
01:12:42,760 --> 01:12:44,955
he found a way
to reverse the effects.

1004
01:12:45,120 --> 01:12:46,599
To regain humanity.

1005
01:12:46,760 --> 01:12:50,116
They had become not
immortal gods, but Hollows.

1006
01:12:50,280 --> 01:12:52,589
Invisible beasts, dangerous...

1007
01:12:52,800 --> 01:12:54,791
cold-blooded, deadly.

1008
01:12:54,960 --> 01:12:56,680
Remember I told you
they raided loops?

1009
01:12:57,640 --> 01:12:58,834
This is why.

1010
01:12:59,440 --> 01:13:01,440
Barron
discovered that by consuming

1011
01:13:01,520 --> 01:13:03,670
the eyes of other peculiars...

1012
01:13:03,840 --> 01:13:05,956
especially children...

1013
01:13:13,440 --> 01:13:14,998
he began to change.

1014
01:13:33,280 --> 01:13:34,599
Consume enough, and a Hollow

1015
01:13:34,720 --> 01:13:36,472
can fully regain
its human form.

1016
01:13:36,680 --> 01:13:37,999
Bon appetit.

1017
01:13:38,680 --> 01:13:41,035
Just as Barron
and some of his friends did.

1018
01:13:42,960 --> 01:13:43,995
Mmm.

1019
01:13:50,360 --> 01:13:52,157
The rest of them
are stuck as Hollows.

1020
01:13:54,720 --> 01:13:58,190
Are you saying
that Barron ate my grand...

1021
01:13:58,360 --> 01:14:00,056
He needs
no more eyes himself.

1022
01:14:00,080 --> 01:14:03,834
But I fear he led a Hollow
to your grandfather. Yes.

1023
01:14:05,640 --> 01:14:07,995
After the first attacks
on loops...

1024
01:14:08,160 --> 01:14:10,515
we all got better at hiding,
making new loops,

1025
01:14:10,640 --> 01:14:12,198
keeping our
whereabouts secret.

1026
01:14:13,480 --> 01:14:15,869
The Hollows grow more
desperate every year...

1027
01:14:16,040 --> 01:14:18,679
and Barron wishes
to help his friends.

1028
01:14:18,840 --> 01:14:21,070
Miss Peregrine, come quickly.
Miss Avocet's awake.

1029
01:14:24,880 --> 01:14:26,438
And suddenly,
I flew into it again...

1030
01:14:26,600 --> 01:14:28,830
Bang! Bang!
I couldn't see anything.

1031
01:14:29,400 --> 01:14:31,868
Oh, Miss Peregrine.
They found my new loop.

1032
01:14:32,040 --> 01:14:34,918
The children.
I tried to save them...

1033
01:14:35,080 --> 01:14:36,672
but there were
so many Hollows.

1034
01:14:36,840 --> 01:14:38,558
I don't know how I escaped.

1035
01:14:41,080 --> 01:14:42,229
You're safe now.

1036
01:14:42,400 --> 01:14:44,231
None of us are safe.

1037
01:14:44,400 --> 01:14:46,356
They set up the machine
in my loop.

1038
01:14:46,520 --> 01:14:48,511
They put it in the cellars
at Blackpool Tower.

1039
01:14:48,680 --> 01:14:49,908
They're still there.

1040
01:14:50,080 --> 01:14:51,911
Their machine?
The experiment.

1041
01:14:52,080 --> 01:14:54,514
They intend to do it again.

1042
01:14:54,680 --> 01:14:56,750
This time, he's using
more Ymbrynes.

1043
01:14:56,920 --> 01:14:58,797
He still wants
to be immortal.

1044
01:15:02,880 --> 01:15:04,791
Do Hollows
only attack peculiars?

1045
01:15:04,960 --> 01:15:06,188
Of course not.

1046
01:15:07,040 --> 01:15:08,314
They're monsters, Jake.

1047
01:15:08,440 --> 01:15:10,590
They'll slaughter anything
in their path.

1048
01:15:10,760 --> 01:15:13,035
Some sheep on the island
were killed.

1049
01:15:13,600 --> 01:15:15,795
You don't think they're here
already, do you?

1050
01:15:16,320 --> 01:15:18,231
Have you seen anyone
with white eyes?

1051
01:15:22,800 --> 01:15:24,756
I'm sorry, children.
We can't remain here.

1052
01:15:24,920 --> 01:15:25,920
What?

1053
01:15:26,120 --> 01:15:28,280
We'll leave on the first ferry
off the island tomorrow.

1054
01:15:28,440 --> 01:15:30,112
Pack anything
of importance.

1055
01:15:30,240 --> 01:15:31,958
Then it's sandwiches
and early to bed.

1056
01:15:32,120 --> 01:15:33,439
Are we leaving for good?

1057
01:15:33,600 --> 01:15:35,272
When are we coming back?
Never.

1058
01:15:35,440 --> 01:15:36,520
If Miss Peregrine's
not here

1059
01:15:36,600 --> 01:15:37,999
to reset the loop
tomorrow night...

1060
01:15:38,160 --> 01:15:39,160
the house gets bombed.

1061
01:15:39,320 --> 01:15:40,469
But our house.

1062
01:15:40,680 --> 01:15:41,715
Don't cry.

1063
01:15:41,800 --> 01:15:42,920
Miss Peregrine will find you

1064
01:15:42,960 --> 01:15:44,400
another lovely house,
somewhere else.

1065
01:15:51,560 --> 01:15:53,437
Once this loop closes,
that's it.

1066
01:15:53,600 --> 01:15:55,397
I can't get back
to my own time.

1067
01:15:55,880 --> 01:15:57,438
You didn't seem
very happy there.

1068
01:15:57,600 --> 01:16:00,956
I can't just leave!
I have a family!

1069
01:16:01,160 --> 01:16:02,513
And you felt ordinary.

1070
01:16:02,680 --> 01:16:05,114
Like, nothing you do
changes anything!

1071
01:16:05,280 --> 01:16:06,872
Now you have a chance
to do something

1072
01:16:06,960 --> 01:16:08,393
that changes everything!

1073
01:16:09,320 --> 01:16:11,311
Jake, we're in danger.

1074
01:16:11,480 --> 01:16:13,948
And you're the only one
who can see the Hollows.

1075
01:16:14,120 --> 01:16:17,157
Yeah, see them, sure.
But I'm not my grandpa!

1076
01:16:18,160 --> 01:16:20,355
I'm not, and I can't fight.

1077
01:16:20,520 --> 01:16:22,112
I can't kill somebody.

1078
01:16:25,920 --> 01:16:28,559
There's only one reason
that I'd stay here...

1079
01:16:28,720 --> 01:16:29,720
Please.

1080
01:16:30,760 --> 01:16:32,273
Just go.

1081
01:17:00,800 --> 01:17:03,360
Jake? Jakey,
there you are.

1082
01:17:03,520 --> 01:17:04,555
Thank God!

1083
01:17:04,760 --> 01:17:06,955
When I heard they found
a body, I freaked.

1084
01:17:31,600 --> 01:17:33,272
Are there stray dogs
around here?

1085
01:17:34,120 --> 01:17:35,120
What you talking about?

1086
01:17:36,640 --> 01:17:38,198
It's like...

1087
01:17:38,360 --> 01:17:39,839
when they find
an injured animal,

1088
01:17:39,920 --> 01:17:41,990
they go for
the soft parts first.

1089
01:17:43,480 --> 01:17:45,072
Same thing happened
to my father.

1090
01:17:45,840 --> 01:17:48,035
The police are
on their way.

1091
01:17:49,160 --> 01:17:50,434
Look, Dad. I've gotta go.

1092
01:17:50,640 --> 01:17:52,676
What? No.
You don't, Jake.

1093
01:17:53,400 --> 01:17:54,480
If this wasn't an accident,

1094
01:17:54,560 --> 01:17:55,800
there's a lunatic
on the island.

1095
01:17:56,280 --> 01:17:58,840
I've known everyone on
this island my whole life.

1096
01:17:59,000 --> 01:18:00,877
Except you, and him.

1097
01:18:01,440 --> 01:18:02,856
And he's been in the pub
all afternoon.

1098
01:18:02,880 --> 01:18:04,791
So have I.
I was sleeping.

1099
01:18:04,960 --> 01:18:06,640
What
about the blind fellow?

1100
01:18:06,760 --> 01:18:09,149
I assumed he was blind.

1101
01:18:09,320 --> 01:18:10,878
Gentleman with
the dark glasses...

1102
01:18:11,080 --> 01:18:13,036
arrived on
the same ferry as me?

1103
01:18:13,200 --> 01:18:15,077
I kept seeing him around.

1104
01:18:15,800 --> 01:18:16,835
Jake!

1105
01:18:17,600 --> 01:18:18,635
Jake!

1106
01:18:19,320 --> 01:18:22,437
Jake! Wait!

1107
01:18:26,880 --> 01:18:28,233
Is your son all right?

1108
01:18:28,400 --> 01:18:29,400
No.

1109
01:18:29,480 --> 01:18:32,790
He has mental
health issues.

1110
01:18:32,960 --> 01:18:33,995
I can't go.

1111
01:18:34,080 --> 01:18:36,469
Let me.
I run 5-Ks all the time.

1112
01:18:50,400 --> 01:18:51,400
Hello?

1113
01:18:56,040 --> 01:18:57,075
Hello?

1114
01:18:58,120 --> 01:18:59,439
Is that you, young man?

1115
01:19:01,200 --> 01:19:02,519
You came through...

1116
01:19:03,480 --> 01:19:04,833
You're peculiar?

1117
01:19:05,960 --> 01:19:07,109
Oh, yes.

1118
01:19:08,120 --> 01:19:11,032
And I'm extremely
grateful to you.

1119
01:19:11,760 --> 01:19:14,228
Terribly hard to find loops
these days.

1120
01:19:15,200 --> 01:19:17,998
So, you followed me from
the beach on purpose?

1121
01:19:18,600 --> 01:19:19,794
Oh, no.

1122
01:19:20,400 --> 01:19:23,312
I've been following you
much further than that.

1123
01:19:28,600 --> 01:19:30,079
Doctor Golan?

1124
01:19:30,600 --> 01:19:31,669
Sometimes.

1125
01:19:32,320 --> 01:19:33,719
When it suits me.

1126
01:19:34,560 --> 01:19:37,438
The breadth
of my peculiarity...

1127
01:19:37,600 --> 01:19:40,512
is purely limited
by my imagination.

1128
01:19:41,440 --> 01:19:43,635
The only thing
I can't change...

1129
01:19:46,520 --> 01:19:48,317
is my eyes.

1130
01:19:54,320 --> 01:19:56,788
Mr. Barron. How do you do?

1131
01:20:00,240 --> 01:20:03,277
I saw you
at your grandfather's.

1132
01:20:04,160 --> 01:20:05,195
I was hoping to get

1133
01:20:05,320 --> 01:20:06,536
Miss Peregrine's
address from him.

1134
01:20:06,560 --> 01:20:08,357
But, alas,
my traveling companion

1135
01:20:08,440 --> 01:20:10,237
got to him before I did.

1136
01:20:10,960 --> 01:20:12,154
As you know...

1137
01:20:12,320 --> 01:20:15,869
there's just no stopping
a hungry Hollowgast!

1138
01:20:19,480 --> 01:20:22,313
Speaking of
my traveling companion...

1139
01:20:23,880 --> 01:20:24,915
he's coming.

1140
01:20:25,320 --> 01:20:27,914
Believe me
when I say to you...

1141
01:20:28,080 --> 01:20:30,913
you don't want to be here...

1142
01:20:31,080 --> 01:20:33,116
when he arrives.

1143
01:20:34,480 --> 01:20:37,631
So, let's be on our way.

1144
01:20:38,760 --> 01:20:39,795
Shall we?

1145
01:20:45,480 --> 01:20:46,833
Excuse me.

1146
01:20:51,760 --> 01:20:52,795
Wait for me.

1147
01:20:57,160 --> 01:20:58,496
I mustn't
forget our calendar.

1148
01:20:58,520 --> 01:20:59,656
Could you fetch it
from the parlor

1149
01:20:59,680 --> 01:21:00,829
please, Miss Avocet?

1150
01:21:04,720 --> 01:21:06,153
Go and help the others.

1151
01:21:19,520 --> 01:21:21,590
Miss Peregrine,
what a pleasure

1152
01:21:21,680 --> 01:21:22,954
to meet you at last!

1153
01:21:24,240 --> 01:21:26,037
May we come in?

1154
01:21:32,920 --> 01:21:34,035
Children!

1155
01:21:34,440 --> 01:21:37,352
Would you make your way
down the stairs, please?

1156
01:21:37,520 --> 01:21:40,273
I give the orders
in this house, Mr. Barron.

1157
01:21:40,440 --> 01:21:41,509
Not today.

1158
01:21:42,000 --> 01:21:45,470
You should know that Jake
has served his purpose.

1159
01:21:45,640 --> 01:21:47,358
If you value his life,
I suggest

1160
01:21:47,440 --> 01:21:49,829
everyone does
as they're told.

1161
01:21:50,000 --> 01:21:51,558
Children!
Shush!

1162
01:21:52,640 --> 01:21:55,359
No one tells my children
what to do!

1163
01:21:57,040 --> 01:21:58,040
Children...

1164
01:21:58,440 --> 01:22:00,396
come down here, please.

1165
01:22:03,720 --> 01:22:04,755
Miss Peregrine...

1166
01:22:04,840 --> 01:22:06,671
I thought I told you
to be quiet.

1167
01:22:09,560 --> 01:22:10,629
Children...

1168
01:22:10,800 --> 01:22:12,756
for Jake's safety...

1169
01:22:12,920 --> 01:22:15,388
we're going to do
what Mr. Barron asks.

1170
01:22:16,080 --> 01:22:17,308
He wishes
to take me with him

1171
01:22:17,400 --> 01:22:18,879
to his rendezvous
in Blackpool.

1172
01:22:19,040 --> 01:22:20,632
So, for his protection...

1173
01:22:20,800 --> 01:22:22,233
he'd like me
to assume bird form,

1174
01:22:22,320 --> 01:22:23,753
preferably caged.

1175
01:22:23,920 --> 01:22:25,990
He'd like you to make your
way into a lockable room,

1176
01:22:26,080 --> 01:22:27,513
such as the parlor...

1177
01:22:27,680 --> 01:22:29,318
as he won't release Jake
if he fears

1178
01:22:29,400 --> 01:22:30,880
an attack could be mounted
upon him...

1179
01:22:30,960 --> 01:22:32,632
once he loses his leverage.

1180
01:22:33,320 --> 01:22:34,594
Correct, Mr. Barron?

1181
01:22:35,960 --> 01:22:37,960
You're sacrificing
yourself and all of us...

1182
01:22:38,800 --> 01:22:39,994
for Jake?

1183
01:22:40,160 --> 01:22:42,833
Mr. Barron travels
with a Hollow, Enoch.

1184
01:22:43,000 --> 01:22:46,037
Once it arrives here,
we're all dead.

1185
01:22:47,680 --> 01:22:50,797
Enoch. Only Jake
can see them.

1186
01:22:50,960 --> 01:22:52,951
She means
he's our only hope.

1187
01:23:37,320 --> 01:23:39,117
It's been my privilege...

1188
01:23:40,040 --> 01:23:41,678
to care for you all.

1189
01:23:44,280 --> 01:23:45,633
Goodbye, my children.

1190
01:23:55,560 --> 01:23:56,560
Now let him go.

1191
01:24:19,880 --> 01:24:21,074
Promise me one thing, Jake.

1192
01:24:24,720 --> 01:24:27,075
That you will try
to look after them all.

1193
01:24:30,880 --> 01:24:32,313
I promise.

1194
01:25:03,280 --> 01:25:04,599
Boo!

1195
01:25:08,800 --> 01:25:09,800
It's getting dark.

1196
01:25:10,200 --> 01:25:12,031
You won't even be able
to see their shadows.

1197
01:25:12,200 --> 01:25:13,269
We have to stay inside.

1198
01:25:13,360 --> 01:25:14,952
It's the only place
we stand a chance.

1199
01:25:15,120 --> 01:25:16,838
He's quite right.
Now, where does

1200
01:25:16,920 --> 01:25:18,433
Miss Peregrine keep
her weapon?

1201
01:25:18,960 --> 01:25:20,393
In there. Let's go.

1202
01:25:20,560 --> 01:25:21,959
Now, all right, children.

1203
01:25:22,120 --> 01:25:23,336
Make sure all the doors
are locked,

1204
01:25:23,360 --> 01:25:25,032
and the windows are latched.

1205
01:25:25,200 --> 01:25:27,475
Everything must be
sealed up tight. Now quickly.

1206
01:25:27,680 --> 01:25:28,795
Quickly! Go!

1207
01:25:39,440 --> 01:25:40,475
Here.

1208
01:25:44,120 --> 01:25:46,839
Jake, I think tonight,
you better answer that.

1209
01:25:47,000 --> 01:25:48,000
Okay.

1210
01:25:52,440 --> 01:25:53,475
Hello?

1211
01:25:53,560 --> 01:25:54,776
Hello, this is Abe.

1212
01:25:54,800 --> 01:25:55,915
Who's that?

1213
01:26:00,640 --> 01:26:03,552
You don't know me yet.
I'm Jake.

1214
01:26:03,760 --> 01:26:06,911
Ah, you're new. Welcome
to the family, Jake.

1215
01:26:07,080 --> 01:26:08,513
Now, I can't talk long...

1216
01:26:08,720 --> 01:26:09,994
so just tell Miss Peregrine...

1217
01:26:10,160 --> 01:26:12,151
I'm at the air base,
and I'm fine.

1218
01:26:15,040 --> 01:26:18,749
I just wanted to say
that I miss you...

1219
01:26:19,600 --> 01:26:21,556
and if I disappointed you...

1220
01:26:21,720 --> 01:26:23,153
I'm sorry.

1221
01:26:24,080 --> 01:26:26,913
You're the best grandpa
in the world.

1222
01:26:40,080 --> 01:26:41,559
Quickly.

1223
01:26:51,440 --> 01:26:53,112
Fiona.
Got it.

1224
01:26:54,240 --> 01:26:55,240
Miss Avocet.

1225
01:26:56,080 --> 01:26:57,149
Now, children.

1226
01:26:57,320 --> 01:26:59,436
Now that you're all here,
there's a few rules.

1227
01:26:59,600 --> 01:27:01,955
Your primary job
is to stay safe.

1228
01:27:02,120 --> 01:27:03,394
Leave the Hollow to me.

1229
01:27:03,560 --> 01:27:05,391
I don't want to see
any heroics.

1230
01:27:06,280 --> 01:27:08,191
Now those of you
with garden tools...

1231
01:27:08,360 --> 01:27:10,510
I must insist that you...

1232
01:27:33,440 --> 01:27:34,759
No, Enoch. Get back!

1233
01:27:36,160 --> 01:27:37,275
Whoa!

1234
01:28:01,160 --> 01:28:02,195
Go. Get to the attic!

1235
01:28:02,360 --> 01:28:03,395
Come on!

1236
01:28:06,320 --> 01:28:07,320
Take her.

1237
01:28:21,600 --> 01:28:23,397
Go. Get out!

1238
01:28:24,600 --> 01:28:25,600
Olive, come on!

1239
01:28:41,160 --> 01:28:42,195
Okay.

1240
01:28:42,600 --> 01:28:43,600
All right, uh...

1241
01:28:43,920 --> 01:28:45,592
Crap! It's almost reset!

1242
01:28:50,360 --> 01:28:52,669
Fiona, is there anything
you can do with that tree?

1243
01:28:52,840 --> 01:28:54,512
- Yes.
- Be careful.

1244
01:28:57,960 --> 01:28:59,234
We're going
through the windows.

1245
01:28:59,320 --> 01:29:00,548
Let's go! Quickly!

1246
01:29:24,800 --> 01:29:25,869
Come on!

1247
01:29:36,680 --> 01:29:38,159
Claire, come on down.

1248
01:29:56,160 --> 01:29:57,160
Come on!

1249
01:29:57,680 --> 01:29:59,432
Be careful.

1250
01:30:11,880 --> 01:30:13,393
Go, Fiona!

1251
01:30:21,080 --> 01:30:22,149
Let's go!

1252
01:30:46,160 --> 01:30:47,957
Was that...
The loop closing.

1253
01:30:49,400 --> 01:30:50,674
It's gone.

1254
01:31:11,920 --> 01:31:13,148
I'm sorry, Jake.

1255
01:31:13,960 --> 01:31:15,678
What do we do now?

1256
01:31:17,120 --> 01:31:19,270
Is there any sign of Barron
and Miss Peregrine?

1257
01:31:19,800 --> 01:31:22,633
Gone. Barron must have
had a boat.

1258
01:31:27,360 --> 01:31:28,839
We have to go after them.

1259
01:31:29,440 --> 01:31:31,112
We know he's taking her
to Blackpool.

1260
01:31:31,280 --> 01:31:33,111
But Blackpool
is miles away.

1261
01:31:33,280 --> 01:31:34,576
The next ferry
doesn't go for hours.

1262
01:31:34,600 --> 01:31:35,828
We'll never make it in time.

1263
01:31:37,600 --> 01:31:39,556
Not unless
we go by boat, too.

1264
01:33:26,200 --> 01:33:27,997
So, there's a loop
here in Blackpool.

1265
01:33:28,200 --> 01:33:31,556
It's only six months old.
January 11th, 2016.

1266
01:33:31,720 --> 01:33:34,518
With Miss Avocet gone,
it can't be reset.

1267
01:33:34,680 --> 01:33:36,477
Won't the loop close?

1268
01:33:37,160 --> 01:33:38,718
Then it's back to real time.

1269
01:33:40,880 --> 01:33:43,030
Jake, you know what
this means, don't you?

1270
01:33:43,720 --> 01:33:44,869
You're gonna die.

1271
01:33:45,040 --> 01:33:46,917
That's not what I mean.

1272
01:33:47,080 --> 01:33:48,399
We have to get
to our own time,

1273
01:33:48,560 --> 01:33:49,560
but you don't.

1274
01:33:50,360 --> 01:33:53,670
You can continue
to live in 2016.

1275
01:33:53,840 --> 01:33:55,432
But why would I do that?

1276
01:33:55,600 --> 01:33:57,192
If we kill Barron...

1277
01:33:57,400 --> 01:34:00,039
he'll be gone,
but time will carry on.

1278
01:34:00,760 --> 01:34:02,557
He won't go to Florida...

1279
01:34:03,400 --> 01:34:07,188
Abe won't die,
and you can go home.

1280
01:34:08,880 --> 01:34:11,075
I could see my grandpa.

1281
01:34:15,720 --> 01:34:18,234
Listen, I can explain
everything to them.

1282
01:34:18,400 --> 01:34:21,358
I can persuade them to take
me to the island and...

1283
01:34:21,520 --> 01:34:23,556
Wait, will you
still be there?

1284
01:34:25,200 --> 01:34:27,395
Our old loop's gone for good.

1285
01:34:28,400 --> 01:34:30,356
We wouldn't see
each other again.

1286
01:34:32,080 --> 01:34:34,230
I thought you wanted me
to stay.

1287
01:34:36,960 --> 01:34:39,190
I know you'll choose Abe.

1288
01:34:39,920 --> 01:34:42,753
If I minded,
I wouldn't have told you.

1289
01:34:51,560 --> 01:34:53,232
So, have you found
Miss Avocet's

1290
01:34:53,320 --> 01:34:54,594
loop on the map yet?

1291
01:34:55,480 --> 01:34:57,311
It's here. But it's new.

1292
01:34:57,480 --> 01:34:59,948
She made it early this year.
That's my year.

1293
01:35:00,120 --> 01:35:01,560
If we don't get out
before it closes,

1294
01:35:01,640 --> 01:35:03,392
we're stuck
in January 2016.

1295
01:35:03,480 --> 01:35:04,515
Great.

1296
01:35:04,600 --> 01:35:06,352
Time catches up
with all of us,

1297
01:35:06,440 --> 01:35:08,271
we all die,
except you. Plan?

1298
01:35:08,760 --> 01:35:10,478
The loop closes at 4:30.

1299
01:35:10,680 --> 01:35:11,874
That means
we need to get in,

1300
01:35:11,960 --> 01:35:13,400
rescue the Ymbrynes
and then get out.

1301
01:35:14,120 --> 01:35:16,076
Yeah, if we're not
already dead.

1302
01:35:16,240 --> 01:35:18,000
Miss Avocet said the machine
is in the cellar

1303
01:35:18,120 --> 01:35:19,296
of the Blackpool Tower
building.

1304
01:35:19,320 --> 01:35:22,073
That means we will be
indoors... with Hollows.

1305
01:35:22,240 --> 01:35:24,595
No, we won't.
I've got a plan.

1306
01:35:24,760 --> 01:35:26,273
But I'm gonna need your help.

1307
01:35:56,880 --> 01:35:58,518
This can't be it,
can it?

1308
01:35:59,120 --> 01:36:01,076
Loop entrances
can be anywhere.

1309
01:36:01,160 --> 01:36:03,355
The one in London's
in a subway tunnel.

1310
01:36:16,040 --> 01:36:17,359
Are you sure this is it?

1311
01:36:20,400 --> 01:36:22,197
I think so.

1312
01:36:24,040 --> 01:36:26,395
Millard, there's something
I need you to do first.

1313
01:36:26,560 --> 01:36:28,869
All right. I know.

1314
01:36:32,240 --> 01:36:34,754
Look. There's the tower.
It's not far.

1315
01:36:34,920 --> 01:36:37,593
Easy for you to say.
I'm freezing.

1316
01:36:43,720 --> 01:36:44,869
Ready?

1317
01:36:55,880 --> 01:36:58,189
All of the doors
to the cellar are locked.

1318
01:36:58,360 --> 01:37:00,400
The only way to reach the
Ymbrynes is through there.

1319
01:37:01,040 --> 01:37:02,359
It's backstage.

1320
01:37:02,520 --> 01:37:04,556
How many Hollows
can you see?

1321
01:37:05,520 --> 01:37:07,351
Four. That's good news.

1322
01:37:07,920 --> 01:37:09,148
I think you and I have

1323
01:37:09,240 --> 01:37:10,912
a very different definition
of good news.

1324
01:37:11,080 --> 01:37:14,231
It means Barron's other
friends haven't arrived yet.

1325
01:37:14,400 --> 01:37:16,072
So they haven't started
the experiment.

1326
01:37:16,960 --> 01:37:18,393
We're not too late.

1327
01:37:20,240 --> 01:37:21,240
Okay, Emma.

1328
01:37:21,920 --> 01:37:23,638
You ready?
You know what to say.

1329
01:37:23,800 --> 01:37:25,119
Here, Jake.

1330
01:37:27,560 --> 01:37:31,030
Our brethren should be
joining us momentarily.

1331
01:37:31,240 --> 01:37:32,798
- This is a day to...
- Hey!

1332
01:37:32,960 --> 01:37:34,473
You down there!

1333
01:37:34,600 --> 01:37:37,068
We killed your Hollow friend,
Mr. Barron.

1334
01:37:37,240 --> 01:37:39,754
And now we've come
for Miss Peregrine.

1335
01:37:39,920 --> 01:37:41,433
Bring her
and all the other Ymbrynes

1336
01:37:41,560 --> 01:37:43,596
to the end of the pier
in five minutes...

1337
01:37:43,760 --> 01:37:45,478
or face the consequences.

1338
01:37:49,640 --> 01:37:51,198
These children must be

1339
01:37:51,280 --> 01:37:53,316
as insane as their
headmistress.

1340
01:37:53,920 --> 01:37:57,799
Still, the Hollows
will be glad of a feed.

1341
01:38:00,640 --> 01:38:02,278
Where are you?

1342
01:38:03,000 --> 01:38:05,798
I know you're in here
somewhere!

1343
01:38:07,640 --> 01:38:08,709
A-ha!

1344
01:38:08,800 --> 01:38:10,916
Good. Listen to me.

1345
01:38:11,080 --> 01:38:14,959
I want you to follow
Mr. Archer and Mr. Clark.

1346
01:38:15,120 --> 01:38:16,880
They're going to take you
down to the pier...

1347
01:38:17,000 --> 01:38:20,151
for a little afternoon tea.

1348
01:38:21,040 --> 01:38:22,996
Mr. Archer, Mr. Clark...

1349
01:38:23,160 --> 01:38:25,196
gather the Hollows
and take them to the pier.

1350
01:38:25,360 --> 01:38:27,749
Those children
killed Malthus?

1351
01:38:27,960 --> 01:38:29,313
Barron's had it in
for Malthus

1352
01:38:29,440 --> 01:38:31,158
ever since he killed
Abe Portman.

1353
01:38:31,320 --> 01:38:33,311
I tracked Abe Portman
for months.

1354
01:38:35,440 --> 01:38:36,998
All I needed
was a few minutes...

1355
01:38:37,160 --> 01:38:40,038
to get the location of Miss
Peregrine's loop from him.

1356
01:38:40,200 --> 01:38:41,474
But no!

1357
01:38:41,680 --> 01:38:43,511
Malthus couldn't wait.

1358
01:38:44,000 --> 01:38:45,149
Instead...

1359
01:38:46,120 --> 01:38:49,556
I had to masquerade
as a psychiatrist...

1360
01:38:49,720 --> 01:38:52,109
for three weeks...

1361
01:38:52,320 --> 01:38:53,673
in Florida!

1362
01:38:55,640 --> 01:38:57,517
Have you ever
been to Florida?

1363
01:39:01,560 --> 01:39:04,393
Did I not tell you to
gather the Hollows?

1364
01:39:04,560 --> 01:39:05,560
What if it's a trap?

1365
01:39:05,720 --> 01:39:07,836
Of course, it is, Miss Edwards.
But what of it?

1366
01:39:08,040 --> 01:39:10,395
A couple of children
against four Hollows.

1367
01:39:10,560 --> 01:39:12,073
Let's get this over with.

1368
01:39:31,720 --> 01:39:32,720
Jake, I'm stuck!

1369
01:39:39,240 --> 01:39:40,240
Hurry up!

1370
01:39:41,520 --> 01:39:42,748
Come on.

1371
01:39:44,200 --> 01:39:45,838
Watch out!

1372
01:40:01,760 --> 01:40:02,829
They're coming!

1373
01:40:17,920 --> 01:40:18,920
Let's go.

1374
01:40:27,120 --> 01:40:28,872
Enoch. Now!

1375
01:40:47,640 --> 01:40:48,640
Go! Now!

1376
01:41:01,800 --> 01:41:02,949
Starting to see them now.

1377
01:41:05,960 --> 01:41:06,960
Phase two.

1378
01:41:12,120 --> 01:41:13,120
Emma, go.

1379
01:41:16,840 --> 01:41:18,796
Don't just stand there.
Get them!

1380
01:43:05,600 --> 01:43:08,558
All right. Good job, guys.
It's time for step two.

1381
01:43:08,720 --> 01:43:10,119
Save Miss Peregrine!

1382
01:43:10,280 --> 01:43:11,793
That's sort of step three.

1383
01:43:11,920 --> 01:43:13,592
First, we've got to deal
with Barron.

1384
01:43:14,480 --> 01:43:15,799
Come on.

1385
01:43:17,960 --> 01:43:19,757
They should've been
back by now.

1386
01:43:19,960 --> 01:43:21,313
I said it was a trap.

1387
01:43:21,480 --> 01:43:22,959
If that's true...

1388
01:43:23,920 --> 01:43:26,798
perhaps we should
move the Ymbrynes now.

1389
01:43:26,960 --> 01:43:28,313
You're not serious?

1390
01:43:28,480 --> 01:43:30,789
Do I not look serious?

1391
01:43:30,960 --> 01:43:34,316
Do I not look like a man
who has searched the globe...

1392
01:43:34,520 --> 01:43:36,988
looking for just
one more eye to eat...

1393
01:43:37,640 --> 01:43:39,949
in hopes of regaining
sufficient humanity...

1394
01:43:40,120 --> 01:43:42,236
to return to his research?

1395
01:43:42,440 --> 01:43:45,000
A man who's spent years
hunting Ymbrynes...

1396
01:43:45,160 --> 01:43:47,993
in preparation
for this night...

1397
01:43:48,200 --> 01:43:50,953
and two, no, three days,
in Wales...

1398
01:43:51,160 --> 01:43:53,674
pretending to look at birds!

1399
01:43:53,840 --> 01:43:55,193
I assure you...

1400
01:43:55,360 --> 01:43:57,590
I will not stand idly by...

1401
01:43:58,640 --> 01:44:02,155
to see my destiny derailed.

1402
01:44:08,960 --> 01:44:10,154
Hugh, do it now!

1403
01:44:24,680 --> 01:44:25,829
Come back here!

1404
01:44:26,000 --> 01:44:27,000
Get them!

1405
01:44:34,840 --> 01:44:35,840
Go. Get down!

1406
01:44:38,320 --> 01:44:41,676
You think you can
stand in my way?

1407
01:44:42,160 --> 01:44:46,039
You, Jake,
content to age and die...

1408
01:44:46,200 --> 01:44:49,954
as if you had not the gift
of peculiarity at all?

1409
01:44:55,240 --> 01:44:58,550
I am a higher being.

1410
01:44:58,720 --> 01:45:01,871
I hold the secret
to eternal life!

1411
01:45:02,040 --> 01:45:03,189
Sorry to interrupt.

1412
01:45:03,720 --> 01:45:05,199
What the...

1413
01:45:16,520 --> 01:45:17,520
Bronwyn.

1414
01:45:22,680 --> 01:45:23,680
Huh!

1415
01:45:23,760 --> 01:45:25,239
You missed me again, Jake.

1416
01:45:25,400 --> 01:45:28,551
I take it accuracy
is not your peculiarity.

1417
01:45:39,040 --> 01:45:42,350
Abe was
a much worthier adversary.

1418
01:45:45,760 --> 01:45:47,751
Don't let him
get to the birds.

1419
01:45:57,240 --> 01:45:58,958
Ooh. Hmm.

1420
01:45:59,560 --> 01:46:02,233
You must put me
in contact with your tailor.

1421
01:46:04,280 --> 01:46:07,955
Ymbrynes, Ymbrynes!
Here I come!

1422
01:46:20,320 --> 01:46:21,389
Cold?

1423
01:46:21,600 --> 01:46:23,955
Wait till the blood
freezes in your veins.

1424
01:46:24,120 --> 01:46:25,235
Hey!

1425
01:46:28,640 --> 01:46:30,680
That was your attempt to
rescue your friend, was it?

1426
01:46:54,480 --> 01:46:56,675
Jake.

1427
01:46:56,840 --> 01:46:58,176
I'll hold him off
as long as I can.

1428
01:46:58,200 --> 01:46:59,633
When are you
going to realize

1429
01:46:59,720 --> 01:47:01,438
you are a terrible shot
with that thing.

1430
01:47:03,280 --> 01:47:05,280
Get the others. I'll meet
you at the loop entrance.

1431
01:47:18,480 --> 01:47:19,549
Let's get you out.

1432
01:47:48,840 --> 01:47:50,034
Eventually...

1433
01:47:50,200 --> 01:47:52,668
you're going to
run out of breath.

1434
01:47:52,840 --> 01:47:56,037
And it'll all be over!

1435
01:47:56,240 --> 01:47:59,835
Death for your beloved
Jake and Miss Peregrine...

1436
01:48:00,000 --> 01:48:03,231
everlasting life for me!

1437
01:48:04,400 --> 01:48:05,674
Ew!

1438
01:48:06,080 --> 01:48:08,355
And a mint for you.

1439
01:49:02,280 --> 01:49:04,077
Olive.

1440
01:49:08,640 --> 01:49:10,278
I'm so sorry, Olive.

1441
01:49:12,320 --> 01:49:14,117
All these years,
I never appreciated you.

1442
01:49:15,640 --> 01:49:17,437
I didn't see how lucky I was.

1443
01:49:19,760 --> 01:49:23,070
I got so used to having
you there, I never realized...

1444
01:49:31,000 --> 01:49:32,000
You never realized what?

1445
01:50:22,040 --> 01:50:24,474
Find your children.
Create new loops.

1446
01:50:27,880 --> 01:50:29,233
So, Jake...

1447
01:50:29,400 --> 01:50:32,710
I see you've inherited your
grandfather's peculiarity.

1448
01:50:32,880 --> 01:50:35,155
You're just as annoying
as he was.

1449
01:50:38,240 --> 01:50:39,878
Speaking of Abe...

1450
01:50:40,360 --> 01:50:42,828
if you should see him
in the afterlife...

1451
01:50:43,560 --> 01:50:45,198
give him my regards.

1452
01:50:53,720 --> 01:50:56,075
Please. We can't risk him
taking you again.

1453
01:51:15,120 --> 01:51:16,758
Enoch! Where
are the others?

1454
01:51:16,920 --> 01:51:18,856
They're safe. Olive is leading
them back to the Ghost Train.

1455
01:51:18,880 --> 01:51:20,757
Jake needs us.
Barron's too strong.

1456
01:51:28,440 --> 01:51:29,919
You've lost Miss Peregrine.

1457
01:51:30,280 --> 01:51:32,475
You've lost everything.
It's over.

1458
01:51:46,000 --> 01:51:47,115
Jake?

1459
01:51:51,400 --> 01:51:52,628
Jake?

1460
01:51:56,480 --> 01:51:57,754
Jake?

1461
01:52:04,440 --> 01:52:05,634
Emma?

1462
01:52:05,800 --> 01:52:07,711
No, wait. Look. That's not me.
It's Barron.

1463
01:52:07,800 --> 01:52:08,800
Don't listen to him.

1464
01:52:08,920 --> 01:52:10,069
He's Barron.
No, I'm Jake.

1465
01:52:10,200 --> 01:52:11,315
That's Barron.

1466
01:52:11,960 --> 01:52:13,473
I've got a better shot
than Jake.

1467
01:52:13,640 --> 01:52:15,320
So, neither of you move
until we sort this.

1468
01:52:15,480 --> 01:52:16,833
Listen to me. I'm Jake.

1469
01:52:17,040 --> 01:52:19,759
I grew up in Florida and
I wanted to be an explorer.

1470
01:52:19,960 --> 01:52:22,280
I thought nothing would ever
change because I was ordinary.

1471
01:52:22,640 --> 01:52:24,198
That's Jake. Get Barron.

1472
01:52:24,360 --> 01:52:25,576
No. Look.
I told him all of this.

1473
01:52:25,600 --> 01:52:26,874
She was my psychiatrist.

1474
01:52:27,480 --> 01:52:29,675
Look, you deal with him.
I'll go find Miss Peregrine.

1475
01:52:38,160 --> 01:52:39,160
Wait.

1476
01:52:40,320 --> 01:52:42,311
Look, I can prove
that I'm me...

1477
01:52:43,200 --> 01:52:45,031
because I'm not ordinary.

1478
01:52:47,560 --> 01:52:49,835
I can do something
no one else can

1479
01:52:58,400 --> 01:53:00,675
I can see the monsters.

1480
01:53:08,520 --> 01:53:09,999
No, wait. It's me!

1481
01:53:27,240 --> 01:53:28,275
Enoch!

1482
01:53:44,240 --> 01:53:46,754
We need to go.
The loop is closing.

1483
01:53:48,080 --> 01:53:49,080
Yeah.

1484
01:53:49,920 --> 01:53:51,114
Those of us who are leaving.

1485
01:54:57,320 --> 01:54:58,320
Emma.

1486
01:54:58,440 --> 01:54:59,634
You love your grandfather.

1487
01:55:00,080 --> 01:55:01,638
There's nothing
more to explain.

1488
01:55:02,080 --> 01:55:05,277
No, I promised Miss Peregrine
I'd look after you all.

1489
01:55:05,440 --> 01:55:07,590
And with her injured,
and you without a loop...

1490
01:55:07,760 --> 01:55:09,034
She'll recover.

1491
01:55:09,840 --> 01:55:12,957
Until then,
we'll be in 1943.

1492
01:55:13,440 --> 01:55:15,908
We'll only age
one day at a time.

1493
01:55:16,080 --> 01:55:17,308
Like normal people.

1494
01:55:18,120 --> 01:55:19,439
Which can be no bad thing.

1495
01:55:19,640 --> 01:55:21,676
What about the Hollows?

1496
01:55:21,840 --> 01:55:24,274
As long as they're out there,
you're not safe.

1497
01:55:25,360 --> 01:55:28,033
We don't need you
to make us feel safe, Jake.

1498
01:55:28,720 --> 01:55:31,518
Because you made us feel brave.

1499
01:55:32,000 --> 01:55:33,479
And that's even better.

1500
01:56:36,440 --> 01:56:38,874
Come on, guys.
Let's go.

1501
01:57:13,280 --> 01:57:14,508
Tygrysku.

1502
01:57:22,080 --> 01:57:24,514
And then we said goodbye...

1503
01:57:25,200 --> 01:57:27,077
and the loop closed.

1504
01:57:28,360 --> 01:57:31,158
I was so scared that
you wouldn't be here.

1505
01:57:32,960 --> 01:57:34,837
That I'd never see you again.

1506
01:57:35,760 --> 01:57:37,318
I'm safe.

1507
01:57:37,440 --> 01:57:39,271
Oh.

1508
01:57:40,640 --> 01:57:43,438
Let me give you
your birthday present.

1509
01:57:44,480 --> 01:57:46,400
Grandpa,
my birthday isn't for months.

1510
01:57:51,320 --> 01:57:53,311
For your travels.

1511
01:57:54,480 --> 01:57:56,038
Go to her, Jake.

1512
01:57:57,640 --> 01:57:59,312
You have the map.

1513
01:57:59,480 --> 01:58:02,472
You can get back to 1943.

1514
01:58:05,000 --> 01:58:07,639
No. Even so,
they took a boat.

1515
01:58:07,800 --> 01:58:09,552
I don't know where they are.

1516
01:58:11,680 --> 01:58:14,148
But you know where they were.

1517
01:58:53,040 --> 01:58:56,874
You have no idea how long
it took me to get here.

1518
01:58:59,000 --> 01:59:01,036
The closest loop
was in the California desert.

1519
01:59:10,000 --> 01:59:12,275
I used it to get to
the Tokyo loop.

1520
01:59:16,560 --> 01:59:19,916
And that led me to the nearest
loop back in 1942...

1521
01:59:20,080 --> 01:59:22,196
where I wound up
joining the Navy.

1522
01:59:22,360 --> 01:59:23,873
Don't ask.

1523
01:59:24,040 --> 01:59:25,951
Then I spent two months
in London trying to...

1524
01:59:53,280 --> 01:59:56,238
Ready for full speed ahead!

1525
02:00:34,560 --> 02:00:37,870
I tried to leave it all
behind me

1526
02:00:38,000 --> 02:00:42,471
But I woke up
And there they were beside me

1527
02:00:45,160 --> 02:00:49,472
And I don't believe it
But I guess it's true

1528
02:00:50,280 --> 02:00:54,398
Some feelings,
they can travel, too

1529
02:00:54,480 --> 02:00:59,600
Oh, there it is again
Sitting on my chest

1530
02:00:59,680 --> 02:01:02,194
Makes it hard to
catch my breath

1531
02:01:02,320 --> 02:01:05,995
I scramble
for the light of change

1532
02:01:08,040 --> 02:01:11,237
You're always on my mind

1533
02:01:13,200 --> 02:01:16,237
You're always on my mind

1534
02:01:16,360 --> 02:01:20,239
And I never minded
being on my own

1535
02:01:21,000 --> 02:01:25,152
Then something broke in me
and I wanted to go home

1536
02:01:25,240 --> 02:01:28,676
To be where you are

1537
02:01:29,240 --> 02:01:34,872
But even closer to you
You seem so very far

1538
02:01:36,040 --> 02:01:40,397
And now I'm reaching out
with every note I sing

1539
02:01:41,040 --> 02:01:45,192
And I hope it gets to you
on some Pacific wind

1540
02:01:45,360 --> 02:01:50,150
Wraps itself around you
and whispers in your ear

1541
02:01:50,280 --> 02:01:55,718
Tells you that I miss you
and I wish that you were here

1542
02:02:06,240 --> 02:02:08,834
And if I stay home
I don't know

1543
02:02:08,920 --> 02:02:12,913
There'll be so much
that I'll have to let go

1544
02:02:13,440 --> 02:02:17,069
You disappear
in all the time

1545
02:02:17,920 --> 02:02:22,118
But I still see you
in the light

1546
02:02:22,960 --> 02:02:26,430
For you, the shadows fight

1547
02:02:26,560 --> 02:02:30,394
And it's beautiful but there's
that tug in the sight

1548
02:02:30,480 --> 02:02:37,033
I must stop time traveling
You're always on my mind

1549
02:02:39,440 --> 02:02:42,750
You're always on my mind

1550
02:02:44,600 --> 02:02:47,512
You're always on my mind

1551
02:02:47,600 --> 02:02:52,037
And I never minded
being on my own

1552
02:02:52,120 --> 02:02:56,398
Then something broke in me
and I wanted to go home

1553
02:02:56,480 --> 02:02:59,472
To be where you are

1554
02:03:00,600 --> 02:03:06,630
But even closer to you
You seem so very far

1555
02:03:07,320 --> 02:03:11,757
And now I'm reaching out
with every note I sing

1556
02:03:12,160 --> 02:03:16,472
And I hope it gets to you
on some Pacific wind

1557
02:03:16,600 --> 02:03:21,469
Wraps itself around you
and whispers in your ear

1558
02:03:21,600 --> 02:03:26,799
Tells you that I miss you
and I wish that you were here

1559
02:03:47,800 --> 02:03:52,191
We all need something
watching over us

1560
02:03:52,640 --> 02:03:56,758
Be it the falcons, the
clouds or the crows

1561
02:03:56,840 --> 02:04:02,949
And then the sea swept in
and left us all speechless

1562
02:04:03,680 --> 02:04:05,830
Speechless

1563
02:04:08,400 --> 02:04:12,393
And I never minded
being on my own

1564
02:04:13,320 --> 02:04:17,393
Then something broke in me
and I wanted to go home

1565
02:04:18,360 --> 02:04:20,510
To be where you are

1566
02:04:21,520 --> 02:04:27,356
But even closer to you
You seem so very far

1567
02:04:28,320 --> 02:04:32,598
And now I'm reaching out
with every note I sing

1568
02:04:33,200 --> 02:04:37,478
And I hope it gets to you
on some Pacific wind

1569
02:04:37,560 --> 02:04:42,236
Wraps itself around you
and whispers in your ear

1570
02:04:42,520 --> 02:04:48,072
Tells you that I miss you and
I wish that you were here
