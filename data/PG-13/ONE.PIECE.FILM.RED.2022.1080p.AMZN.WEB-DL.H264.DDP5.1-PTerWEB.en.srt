1
00:00:18,204 --> 00:00:21,437
In the time of the Great Sea pirate

2
00:00:21,808 --> 00:00:27,343
The oceans are filled with men with ambitions for wealth, fame and power

3
00:00:27,343 --> 00:00:31,147
It's a dream for a pirate

4
00:00:31,517 --> 00:00:36,983
But some of them just like to plunder

5
00:00:37,223 --> 00:00:44,190
For the weak these are times of endless persecution

6
00:00:45,691 --> 00:00:51,097
Despite being under the jurisdiction of a world government the navy was powerless to protect the weak

7
00:00:51,097 --> 00:00:56,772
So who can they rely on and what can they do to be saved?

8
00:00:59,175 --> 00:01:04,710
We really don't have a choice no one cares about people like us

9
00:01:05,511 --> 00:01:08,484
All I can do is cry...

10
00:01:09,415 --> 00:01:13,419
That's what everyone says. Pirates are bad guys. And worse...

11
00:01:13,459 --> 00:01:15,591
I'm so hungry

12
00:01:16,362 --> 00:01:19,195
What are we supposed to do when the pirates have taken everything

13
00:01:19,195 --> 00:01:20,756
Yeah, it's all because of the pirates

14
00:01:21,067 --> 00:01:24,831
All because those selfish brutes took our joy

15
00:01:26,873 --> 00:01:30,366
Do you understand now?

16
00:01:30,376 --> 00:01:33,169
I'm begging you to do something about our unfortunate situation, okay

17
00:01:33,579 --> 00:01:36,542
Only you only you can help us

18
00:01:36,542 --> 00:01:37,473
I beg you

19
00:01:37,513 --> 00:01:38,374
You're the only one who can help us

20
00:01:38,384 --> 00:01:39,145
I beg you

21
00:01:39,185 --> 00:01:40,576
Just you

22
00:01:40,586 --> 00:01:42,048
Please, please, please

23
00:01:42,548 --> 00:01:45,922
I know, I know

24
00:01:47,453 --> 00:01:51,557
I will create a new era for you that will make us all happy

25
00:01:52,258 --> 00:01:54,030
Where are our seats?

26
00:01:54,030 --> 00:01:55,361
I'd like to buy some peripheral products

27
00:01:55,431 --> 00:01:57,363
What a long dragon

28
00:01:58,104 --> 00:01:59,365
I have to go to the bathroom later. Oh, my God, your seat has food

29
00:02:00,206 --> 00:02:05,201
Yeah because it's a platinum ticket

30
00:02:15,751 --> 00:02:18,354
There must be a lot of people here

31
00:02:18,354 --> 00:02:21,818
Because it was Uta's first time singing live in front of fans

32
00:02:22,058 --> 00:02:26,262
Until now, we've only seen her in the telephony bug

33
00:02:27,563 --> 00:02:33,269
To see Uta live in such a beautiful place, I really...

34
00:02:36,402 --> 00:02:42,478
Mermaids are coming. It looks like it's gonna be fun. But why are we dressed like this

35
00:02:42,979 --> 00:02:47,483
It's to make her sing better and then someone in costume can get these

36
00:02:47,483 --> 00:02:48,885
I see

37
00:02:48,885 --> 00:02:50,416
I'm looking forward to it

38
00:02:50,556 --> 00:02:53,449
After all, she's the most loved person in the world right now

39
00:02:53,459 --> 00:02:55,651
Is she really that great?

40
00:02:55,661 --> 00:02:58,354
As the King of Souls, I don't normally say that

41
00:02:58,394 --> 00:03:00,626
But the songs she sings really seem from another world

42
00:03:01,327 --> 00:03:04,360
Uta, Uta, I love...

43
00:03:04,370 --> 00:03:06,302
That's boring. What?

44
00:03:06,372 --> 00:03:10,807
Damn swordsman You come back here and say it again if you dare and I'll fry you till you're juicy

45
00:03:11,307 --> 00:03:13,409
Try it on me, Curly

46
00:03:14,210 --> 00:03:17,874
Here we go

47
00:03:17,884 --> 00:03:20,847
The concert started with Luffy

48
00:03:23,219 --> 00:03:27,183
"We choose our own future."

49
00:03:27,293 --> 00:03:30,126
"Try a new path."

50
00:03:30,226 --> 00:03:43,639
"If I change the world..."

51
00:04:06,933 --> 00:04:08,995
"Say goodbye to all those who oppose us."

52
00:04:09,065 --> 00:04:13,199
"No one has the power to stop the change that music can bring."

53
00:04:14,069 --> 00:04:16,501
"You can't stop the magic."

54
00:04:18,003 --> 00:04:21,607
"Close your eyes and you can see the future right in front of you."

55
00:04:21,848 --> 00:04:24,610
"Every word I sing leads you closer to your destiny."

56
00:04:24,650 --> 00:04:28,915
"When you get there don't let go."

57
00:04:29,015 --> 00:04:31,818
"If you want to play a real game, untie the chains."

58
00:04:31,858 --> 00:04:34,350
"When the melody is strung we are walking on a tight rope."

59
00:04:34,620 --> 00:04:38,224
"Don't want to cry don't want to try to forget"

60
00:04:38,394 --> 00:04:39,195
"Let me live in this dream."

61
00:04:39,395 --> 00:04:40,456
"I want to be free."

62
00:04:40,466 --> 00:04:41,397
"I want to be free"

63
00:04:41,497 --> 00:04:43,559
"And then embrace the new era."

64
00:04:43,729 --> 00:04:47,003
"I know we can do this."

65
00:04:47,073 --> 00:04:49,765
"Create a new world."

66
00:04:50,776 --> 00:04:53,539
"We choose our own future."

67
00:04:53,539 --> 00:04:55,541
"Try to take a new path."

68
00:04:55,541 --> 00:05:00,376
"If I change the world"

69
00:05:00,686 --> 00:05:04,080
"This infinite music can be transformative."

70
00:05:04,420 --> 00:05:06,552
"Let the message in the song"

71
00:05:06,552 --> 00:05:08,684
"Go further."

72
00:05:08,925 --> 00:05:11,427
"This dream will come true."

73
00:05:11,527 --> 00:05:12,758
"I believe you"

74
00:05:34,150 --> 00:05:37,413
"Say goodbye to everything that's holding you down."

75
00:05:37,453 --> 00:05:39,986
"Let colorful music take you away from reality."

76
00:05:40,126 --> 00:05:44,620
"We have to move on."

77
00:05:45,531 --> 00:05:47,964
"Close your eyes, hold my hand and let's run."

78
00:05:48,194 --> 00:05:52,799
"We don't need to live like this. I know we can do better."

79
00:05:52,939 --> 00:05:56,803
"I sing for freedom."

80
00:05:57,173 --> 00:05:59,435
"If you want to play a real game, untie the chains."

81
00:05:59,605 --> 00:06:01,677
"Let the melody light the way for new vistas."

82
00:06:01,677 --> 00:06:04,911
"Don't want to cry don't want to try to forget"

83
00:06:05,651 --> 00:06:07,113
"Let me live in this dream."

84
00:06:07,283 --> 00:06:09,585
"I want to be free"

85
00:06:09,715 --> 00:06:12,088
"And then embrace the new era."

86
00:06:12,288 --> 00:06:14,921
"I know we can do this."

87
00:06:14,961 --> 00:06:17,854
"Create a new world."

88
00:06:18,224 --> 00:06:20,957
"We choose our own future"

89
00:06:21,267 --> 00:06:22,959
"Try a new path."

90
00:06:22,999 --> 00:06:30,136
"If I change the world"

91
00:06:30,236 --> 00:06:31,107
"This infinite music can be transformative."

92
00:06:32,308 --> 00:06:34,110
"Let the message in the song"

93
00:06:34,210 --> 00:06:39,245
"Go further."

94
00:06:39,415 --> 00:06:39,816
"This is the new era."

95
00:06:39,816 --> 00:06:42,318
"This is the new era."

96
00:07:01,037 --> 00:07:03,199
'This is the new era'

97
00:07:14,050 --> 00:07:17,954
Hi, it's nice to finally meet you. I'm Uta

98
00:07:22,959 --> 00:07:26,492
I'm sorry I'm a little moved

99
00:07:26,492 --> 00:07:26,793
I'm sorry I'm a little moved

100
00:07:29,765 --> 00:07:32,268
Uta we love you Uta we love you

101
00:07:32,268 --> 00:07:33,129
Uta loves you...

102
00:07:35,601 --> 00:07:39,135
Everybody, let's play together today

103
00:07:40,506 --> 00:07:42,708
Are you guys ready?

104
00:07:42,708 --> 00:07:43,609
Ready to go

105
00:07:43,679 --> 00:07:51,387
Wealth and fame will be ours if we can kidnap the star Sorry Uta

106
00:07:52,118 --> 00:07:55,521
Uta, Uta

107
00:07:58,424 --> 00:07:59,996
Feeding Luffy

108
00:08:03,930 --> 00:08:07,433
What? Did he try to kidnap her too?

109
00:08:08,274 --> 00:08:11,137
Oh, it's you

110
00:08:11,137 --> 00:08:13,239
Uta, are you right

111
00:08:13,910 --> 00:08:17,373
It's me. Who is it?

112
00:08:17,513 --> 00:08:19,175
Is it Luffy?

113
00:08:19,886 --> 00:08:20,216
Is it Luffy?

114
00:08:20,316 --> 00:08:24,380
Long time no see Uta Luffy

115
00:08:38,204 --> 00:08:39,464
That straw hat...

116
00:08:39,505 --> 00:08:40,696
Isn't he the fifth starbelt on the sea?

117
00:08:40,735 --> 00:08:44,640
Really? How could Uta be friends with a sea pirate?

118
00:08:46,142 --> 00:08:48,744
Does Luffy know Uta?

119
00:08:48,744 --> 00:08:51,247
If that guy really knew me at least he introduced me to Uta

120
00:08:51,447 --> 00:08:53,749
Why are you friends with Princess Uta?

121
00:08:53,749 --> 00:08:54,250
Why?

122
00:08:54,250 --> 00:08:54,981
Why?

123
00:08:55,321 --> 00:08:58,855
That's because she's Shanks's daughter

124
00:09:07,763 --> 00:09:09,195
Isn't Shanks just...

125
00:09:09,335 --> 00:09:11,898
One of the four Kings of a district evil villain?

126
00:09:11,968 --> 00:09:13,429
I remember it a long time ago

127
00:09:13,699 --> 00:09:17,233
He's the same seafarer who attacked Eligia

128
00:09:18,204 --> 00:09:19,705
uttar

129
00:09:23,049 --> 00:09:27,143
I was wondering what to do when I heard the concert was in Eligia...

130
00:09:27,253 --> 00:09:29,115
You mean the legend

131
00:09:29,115 --> 00:09:32,819
Yeah, but I didn't think the bigger news would get out

132
00:09:37,023 --> 00:09:38,324
What do you want?

133
00:09:38,724 --> 00:09:41,898
The fourth sea emperor, the red-headed Shanks, had a daughter

134
00:09:41,928 --> 00:09:46,762
If that's true you're a redhead's biggest weakness

135
00:09:46,772 --> 00:09:50,807
If we turn you over to some other powerful Hai Fu, we'll make a lot of money

136
00:09:52,038 --> 00:09:55,111
So it's a shame that today's concert has been canceled

137
00:09:55,211 --> 00:09:57,473
Hot air fist

138
00:09:58,414 --> 00:09:59,475
Come out

139
00:10:02,118 --> 00:10:04,450
That girl is ours now

140
00:10:04,690 --> 00:10:07,423
Are you... Which branch branch?

141
00:10:07,523 --> 00:10:10,226
I'm Borichun from BIG MOM, The Pirates

142
00:10:10,326 --> 00:10:11,557
Who was standing next to her

143
00:10:11,858 --> 00:10:17,834
I'm BIG MOM Charlotte Lingling's fourth son. Owen looks fun. Let me join in

144
00:10:17,864 --> 00:10:21,868
Actually, I just came by to see what's going on and what's so interesting about this place

145
00:10:23,469 --> 00:10:27,303
Uta, I'm sorry I have to take you home to make a letter for Mom

146
00:10:27,313 --> 00:10:28,644
Wait a minute

147
00:10:29,415 --> 00:10:30,676
it doesn't matter

148
00:10:31,347 --> 00:10:35,551
Hey, you bastards are gonna have to beat me if you're gonna take Uta

149
00:10:35,551 --> 00:10:39,816
We can't let these bastards ruin that beautiful stage

150
00:10:40,186 --> 00:10:42,819
It's finally getting more interesting

151
00:10:43,329 --> 00:10:45,621
Don't underestimate our ice Mother pirates

152
00:10:47,593 --> 00:10:49,866
The song of blowing snow cut

153
00:10:53,299 --> 00:10:54,871
Jellyfish fist

154
00:10:56,372 --> 00:10:56,833
What a shame

155
00:10:56,843 --> 00:10:57,503
The concert just started

156
00:11:00,506 --> 00:11:03,009
Come and protect Uta

157
00:11:15,922 --> 00:11:16,192
Rubber machine gun

158
00:11:18,094 --> 00:11:18,424
Rubber machine gun

159
00:11:23,870 --> 00:11:24,500
Spider flower

160
00:11:27,033 --> 00:11:27,533
Come on

161
00:11:29,075 --> 00:11:34,040
Okay, time out Luffy and everyone thanks for protecting me but no more fighting

162
00:11:35,341 --> 00:11:39,075
Now that you're all my fans, you should get along and enjoy the concert

163
00:11:43,089 --> 00:11:43,719
But Princess Uta these men tried to kidnap you did you know that

164
00:11:43,890 --> 00:11:46,953
And people like you don't listen to you

165
00:11:46,993 --> 00:11:50,556
If we want something we will not fight for it or get it back. We are pirates

166
00:11:52,028 --> 00:11:53,059
All right, Pirates

167
00:11:54,330 --> 00:11:57,063
I forgive you for the bad things you've done

168
00:11:57,163 --> 00:12:04,700
So does everyone else stop being a bad sea pirate and join me in making the world a better place

169
00:12:06,442 --> 00:12:08,544
With my song everyone can live in peace and be happy

170
00:12:12,278 --> 00:12:17,583
There is no such thing as peace in this world or I'll tear the face off this stupid kid

171
00:12:18,985 --> 00:12:20,416
You don't mess with her. She's my prize

172
00:12:22,728 --> 00:12:25,591
Guys, aren't you here to enjoy my music?

173
00:12:26,092 --> 00:12:27,964
Don't forget we're pirates

174
00:12:27,994 --> 00:12:31,027
We got more important things to do first than your song

175
00:12:31,067 --> 00:12:33,699
We rarely come here to see a concert

176
00:12:33,699 --> 00:12:36,472
To hurt our feelings and Uta's feelings like that

177
00:12:36,702 --> 00:12:40,076
Too bad then let me write a song

178
00:12:46,152 --> 00:12:49,185
"You don't need to worry from now on."

179
00:12:49,235 --> 00:12:53,049
"There's no need to fret.""

180
00:12:53,559 --> 00:12:57,824
"Your dream is our dream is what each and every one of you wants."

181
00:12:58,324 --> 00:13:02,929
"As soon as you start singing your heart will become as clear as the sky."

182
00:13:03,029 --> 00:13:04,961
"Don't worry. "

183
00:13:05,131 --> 00:13:09,205
"I am the strongest"

184
00:13:16,482 --> 00:13:19,615
"My Song"

185
00:13:19,946 --> 00:13:21,047
"Makes the birds fly high in the sky. "

186
00:13:21,217 --> 00:13:23,249
"Even the clothes that flutter in the wind."

187
00:13:23,419 --> 00:13:26,923
"Rock like a dancer too."

188
00:13:26,923 --> 00:13:29,255
"Your voice"

189
00:13:29,395 --> 00:13:32,358
"Let me rejoice."

190
00:13:32,528 --> 00:13:34,610
"If you accidentally get hurt."

191
00:13:34,901 --> 00:13:36,462
"Come on, come on, let me protect you."

192
00:13:36,632 --> 00:13:39,635
"A new landscape that I've never seen before."

193
00:13:40,066 --> 00:13:41,697
"We can definitely see it."

194
00:13:41,868 --> 00:13:46,903
"If you want to talk about why."

195
00:13:46,943 --> 00:13:49,205
"Well, just because we're alive."

196
00:13:49,515 --> 00:13:52,849
"Come on, let's hold hands."

197
00:13:52,849 --> 00:13:55,481
"Go where the light shines."

198
00:13:55,481 --> 00:13:57,513
"Everybody's dream."

199
00:13:57,583 --> 00:13:59,415
"It is my happiness."

200
00:13:59,485 --> 00:14:02,158
"Not anywhere."

201
00:14:02,188 --> 00:14:05,691
"Only you have it."

202
00:14:05,862 --> 00:14:07,563
"That softness"

203
00:14:07,593 --> 00:14:11,798
"Make me stronger."

204
00:14:12,698 --> 00:14:20,036
"I'm the strongest when you're with me"

205
00:14:20,706 --> 00:14:25,241
Guys those bad pirates have turned into a song

206
00:14:25,281 --> 00:14:28,084
It's safe now so don't worry

207
00:14:28,084 --> 00:14:28,845
It's safe now so don't worry

208
00:14:32,688 --> 00:14:37,323
Yeah, well, they may be father and daughter but Shanks and Uta are different

209
00:14:37,423 --> 00:14:38,594
That's great

210
00:14:38,724 --> 00:14:41,697
You're getting so tough, Uta

211
00:14:49,836 --> 00:14:52,408
I wonder if she ate some demon fruit

212
00:14:52,438 --> 00:14:54,811
I don't know. I've never heard of it

213
00:14:54,811 --> 00:14:56,843
What is this?

214
00:14:57,213 --> 00:15:00,016
What are you doing We're going back

215
00:15:02,488 --> 00:15:05,351
I have some good news for you

216
00:15:06,492 --> 00:15:13,459
I used to rely on the telephony bug all the time and it made me feel tired

217
00:15:13,499 --> 00:15:17,433
The live stream will be over soon but this time the concert is endless and it will go on forever

218
00:15:17,463 --> 00:15:18,034
what

219
00:15:18,334 --> 00:15:21,667
Yeah, it means I can be with you forever

220
00:15:22,338 --> 00:15:28,744
For those of you watching and those of you watching let's keep having fun

221
00:15:31,848 --> 00:15:33,609
That's impressive.

222
00:15:33,619 --> 00:15:36,112
She's going ahead with her own concert

223
00:15:36,122 --> 00:15:37,653
That's amazing

224
00:15:37,683 --> 00:15:48,364
Uta...

225
00:15:48,594 --> 00:15:51,127
One more thing and this is very important

226
00:15:51,267 --> 00:15:57,834
The entire Navy and the governments of the world ask you not to interfere with my concert

227
00:15:58,004 --> 00:16:04,610
Everyone is looking for fun and fun and you'd better be prepared if you go overboard

228
00:16:04,650 --> 00:16:10,316
I am Uta who will create a new era and I will make people happy with my songs

229
00:16:12,618 --> 00:16:15,451
All right, our next song

230
00:16:18,825 --> 00:16:22,859
Redhead actually has a daughter as Cipher Pol reports

231
00:16:23,299 --> 00:16:28,434
A new enemy has emerged against the age of the Great Sea pirate

232
00:16:28,434 --> 00:16:32,438
It's complicated because a lot of people are supportive of her

233
00:16:32,438 --> 00:16:36,072
We need to kill this revolution before it's too late

234
00:16:36,112 --> 00:16:40,276
Is that girl really Friend's daughter

235
00:16:40,286 --> 00:16:43,719
The presence of Tol Musica is also worrying

236
00:16:46,222 --> 00:16:51,457
If it wakes up again be prepared we may not be able to defeat it

237
00:16:54,430 --> 00:16:59,495
Yeah, the authorities have decided to arrest Uta and she's dangerous

238
00:16:59,605 --> 00:17:05,541
It's weird that the whole world is watching when she's just a girl

239
00:17:05,541 --> 00:17:07,743
Hey, are you underestimating her

240
00:17:07,974 --> 00:17:10,306
She's on the Island of Eligia Music

241
00:17:10,847 --> 00:17:14,851
That's where Tot Musica was sealed long ago

242
00:17:14,951 --> 00:17:17,613
So how many people are you going to send

243
00:17:17,623 --> 00:17:21,186
How many ships do we have right now to get to Eligia?

244
00:17:21,287 --> 00:17:21,888
Thirty ships

245
00:17:21,927 --> 00:17:26,661
Take all the companies and teams and send out all the ships

246
00:17:27,423 --> 00:17:31,367
If the phone bug can't use the flagship command will use the flag signal to send out the signal thin code 044 every ship should know

247
00:17:31,868 --> 00:17:34,170
Captain turn around follow the signal and cooperate with the others Don't rush but be prepared don't be lazy turn around quickly

248
00:17:34,170 --> 00:17:38,134
The airflow meter measures a level 4 breeze with long waves on the water and lots of white waves

249
00:17:38,144 --> 00:17:41,437
Attention Every ship Every ship must assemble their gunners and check every cannon

250
00:17:41,447 --> 00:17:44,911
Make sure there are no cracks in the cannon and make sure there are no holes in the ignition and check the wheels

251
00:17:44,911 --> 00:17:46,342
No moving boats were detected in the vicinity

252
00:17:46,352 --> 00:17:48,544
There are no obstacles in sight and every boat is in perfect condition and ready to sail

253
00:17:48,855 --> 00:17:52,748
Are you hungry?

254
00:17:52,919 --> 00:17:57,994
Let me cook the good food and the fun stuff

255
00:17:59,125 --> 00:18:00,156
That's impressive.

256
00:18:00,166 --> 00:18:02,298
Can I really do this?

257
00:18:02,498 --> 00:18:03,659
Of course,

258
00:18:03,769 --> 00:18:11,737
Guys here you can eat anything you want and sing and dance and play with me whenever you want, okay

259
00:18:11,908 --> 00:18:12,969
It's like a dream...

260
00:18:13,209 --> 00:18:19,745
Every dream will come true if you stay with me and there's nothing here that scares you

261
00:18:19,886 --> 00:18:22,248
The new era is the best!

262
00:18:28,795 --> 00:18:34,290
She's more capable than we thought. Are we underestimating her

263
00:18:34,300 --> 00:18:40,596
Mom Mom is more than just ability turns out she is the daughter of red hair

264
00:18:40,606 --> 00:18:41,097
Mom Mom is more than just ability turns out she is the daughter of red hair

265
00:18:41,107 --> 00:18:43,499
We're gonna get her

266
00:18:43,709 --> 00:18:49,705
And those straw hat assholes are gonna hate it too and I'd love to see them beat me

267
00:18:50,046 --> 00:18:52,678
Let me go to Eligia

268
00:18:54,580 --> 00:18:58,785
I can't just lose my sister and stand by

269
00:19:01,788 --> 00:19:04,560
This place is a chef's paradise

270
00:19:04,700 --> 00:19:06,923
If you ask Uta, she might still be able to make wine

271
00:19:06,963 --> 00:19:07,693
Yeah, Uta has access to unlimited treasure

272
00:19:10,897 --> 00:19:12,068
What kind of power is that

273
00:19:12,138 --> 00:19:16,332
She's pretty strong for a demon fruit user

274
00:19:16,472 --> 00:19:20,406
Yeah, I've never heard of anyone with that kind of invincibility

275
00:19:20,446 --> 00:19:24,380
Luffy, aren't you Uta's friend or do you know something?

276
00:19:24,510 --> 00:19:28,514
She has always been a good singer

277
00:19:28,684 --> 00:19:29,285
what

278
00:19:29,315 --> 00:19:36,152
Someone may have given Uta this ability

279
00:19:36,192 --> 00:19:38,154
Maybe that person is the god of music...

280
00:19:38,224 --> 00:19:40,556
Hey, Luffy, did you guys have a good time

281
00:19:40,666 --> 00:19:41,527
Very happy Princess Uta

282
00:19:41,527 --> 00:19:42,598
Very happy Princess Uta

283
00:19:42,598 --> 00:19:45,531
You have so many rare ingredients and this place is heaven

284
00:19:45,771 --> 00:19:47,904
It's so much fun here

285
00:19:47,974 --> 00:19:52,038
I'm glad Luffy's friends are so happy

286
00:19:52,178 --> 00:19:53,870
Hello? Is everyone here

287
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:54,310
Yes.

288
00:19:54,310 --> 00:19:56,672
If you believe me, this hat is...

289
00:19:56,883 --> 00:19:58,945
I'm not lying to you

290
00:19:59,015 --> 00:20:01,878
Luffy, let's have a race

291
00:20:02,018 --> 00:20:04,620
You can't beat me right now

292
00:20:04,750 --> 00:20:08,785
What are you talking about that I've needed a meeting 83 times

293
00:20:09,025 --> 00:20:11,888
Are you wrong? I'm the one who won 183 in a row

294
00:20:11,858 --> 00:20:14,490
The two views are completely different

295
00:20:14,530 --> 00:20:15,661
What competition?

296
00:20:16,362 --> 00:20:21,037
Luffy and I used to have all kinds of competitions like knife throwing and arm wrestling and all that

297
00:20:21,437 --> 00:20:24,971
Come on and make this the event of the day

298
00:20:31,848 --> 00:20:34,911
The fastest chicken eater wins

299
00:20:37,083 --> 00:20:40,116
Oh, I miss this and what else

300
00:20:39,425 --> 00:20:41,287
Don't worry. I'm ready

301
00:20:44,460 --> 00:20:46,562
Come on, get in position

302
00:20:59,205 --> 00:20:59,775
start

303
00:20:59,775 --> 00:21:02,839
Wow, thank you.

304
00:21:06,983 --> 00:21:09,745
Uta won. She won

305
00:21:10,136 --> 00:21:13,219
Not fair Uta

306
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:15,721
Do not fall into the sea

307
00:21:23,299 --> 00:21:27,633
By the way, Luffy ate the devil fruit, didn't he? I'm sorry

308
00:21:27,773 --> 00:21:29,866
You just broke the rules. Do it again

309
00:21:29,976 --> 00:21:31,838
There you go again with the sore loser

310
00:21:31,978 --> 00:21:35,541
I won, so you're gonna tell me where Shanks is

311
00:21:35,611 --> 00:21:36,312
I don't know

312
00:21:36,412 --> 00:21:40,246
So what happened to your straw hat and now I'm keeping it

313
00:21:40,316 --> 00:21:43,149
Hey, how do you two know each other?

314
00:21:43,199 --> 00:21:47,954
That's when she came to Faucha with Shanks and the others

315
00:21:48,094 --> 00:21:50,726
Fosha Village is your hometown, isn't it, Luffy

316
00:21:50,857 --> 00:21:51,828
Yes.

317
00:21:52,328 --> 00:21:53,189
12 years ago...

318
00:21:57,804 --> 00:22:00,736
Uta, you're daydreaming again

319
00:22:00,807 --> 00:22:02,338
Come on over

320
00:22:02,538 --> 00:22:05,902
Don't be boring. Let's have a race

321
00:22:05,912 --> 00:22:11,107
You are so childish. What are you competing against

322
00:22:11,147 --> 00:22:12,748
Chicken Eating Contest

323
00:22:12,748 --> 00:22:13,549
wang

324
00:22:14,350 --> 00:22:16,883
Whoever eats the fastest wins, okay

325
00:22:16,883 --> 00:22:17,553
good

326
00:22:17,723 --> 00:22:20,556
This is too dangerous for you two to fight

327
00:22:20,556 --> 00:22:21,257
No way.

328
00:22:21,257 --> 00:22:22,758
Uta Luffy

329
00:22:23,459 --> 00:22:24,961
Let them compete

330
00:22:26,963 --> 00:22:29,826
It was an important match for both of them

331
00:22:30,967 --> 00:22:31,697
Come on

332
00:22:31,737 --> 00:22:32,428
To prepare

333
00:22:32,598 --> 00:22:34,530
Three two one

334
00:22:35,171 --> 00:22:37,533
What are they competing for

335
00:22:37,543 --> 00:22:40,877
Let's see who turns out to be a great sea pirate

336
00:22:44,710 --> 00:22:46,542
Will Luffy win

337
00:22:46,352 --> 00:22:49,085
You can have my juice. Yes, thank you

338
00:22:51,918 --> 00:22:52,388
luffy

339
00:22:52,388 --> 00:22:55,221
I can't believe you fell for the same trick again

340
00:22:55,221 --> 00:22:56,492
Are you okay?

341
00:22:56,522 --> 00:22:59,425
The competition... The game is not over yet

342
00:22:59,425 --> 00:23:01,297
There you go again with the sore loser

343
00:23:01,297 --> 00:23:02,999
You cheated you're supposed to be the sore loser

344
00:23:03,029 --> 00:23:08,764
I'm a sea pirate. I'm not cheating. You're just a kid letting your guard down in a fair game

345
00:23:08,835 --> 00:23:12,869
Shanks doesn't even think you're a pirate yet

346
00:23:12,909 --> 00:23:15,711
Shut up. I'm Shanks 'daughter

347
00:23:15,741 --> 00:23:21,517
Unlike you, I've gone on many adventures with him on boats and I'm in a different league than you

348
00:23:21,517 --> 00:23:22,618
No, it is

349
00:23:22,688 --> 00:23:24,921
Then come and fight me like a sea pirate

350
00:23:25,521 --> 00:23:27,483
Sure.

351
00:23:32,929 --> 00:23:35,331
That's enough of you two

352
00:23:35,361 --> 00:23:39,765
You hit a child with a knife that's against the rules of sea thieving Shanks

353
00:23:39,906 --> 00:23:42,668
Silly boy this is called love deep responsibility

354
00:23:42,708 --> 00:23:44,770
You don't get love when it's a knife

355
00:23:44,941 --> 00:23:47,103
Do you really love me

356
00:23:47,313 --> 00:23:51,447
I love you, too, Shanks

357
00:23:51,447 --> 00:23:53,179
Shanks

358
00:23:53,219 --> 00:23:56,582
You two don't look around me and neither do Uta and Luffy

359
00:23:56,853 --> 00:24:00,416
Why do you call your father Shanks

360
00:24:00,516 --> 00:24:05,661
He's my dad but he's also my captain and he's cool, right

361
00:24:07,663 --> 00:24:12,198
Now that I won Luffy today I'm in a good mood so I'm gonna sing a song

362
00:24:12,198 --> 00:24:14,831
Shanks, I'm going out to sea

363
00:24:14,841 --> 00:24:17,603
We don't need violent kids like you

364
00:24:17,603 --> 00:24:18,474
Then why does Uta get to go

365
00:24:18,504 --> 00:24:22,238
She'll take care of our ship while we're fighting but you can't

366
00:24:24,580 --> 00:24:25,141
Yes.

367
00:24:25,351 --> 00:24:28,644
I'm Gojiuta from the Red-headed One Pirates

368
00:24:28,654 --> 00:24:33,389
I am a girl who makes music for a new era where all people can enjoy freedom

369
00:24:33,519 --> 00:24:36,392
All right, it's time to welcome our Goliath

370
00:24:42,398 --> 00:24:49,535
"Where is this wind coming from and where is it taking us?"

371
00:24:49,535 --> 00:24:55,972
"I looked to the sky for answers but it didn't answer me."

372
00:24:56,042 --> 00:25:02,869
"Where is this song that I'm singing going to go?"

373
00:25:02,949 --> 00:25:09,926
"I try to find the answer inside."

374
00:25:10,056 --> 00:25:19,635
"Once more we are bravely heading out into the unknown sea."

375
00:25:22,038 --> 00:25:25,241
"I have only one wish"

376
00:25:38,925 --> 00:25:40,887
Good enough for me to sing

377
00:25:41,027 --> 00:25:44,260
Yeah, go ahead and sing. Yeah

378
00:25:47,163 --> 00:25:49,465
Now that I think about it, it's like you just disappeared

379
00:25:51,167 --> 00:25:53,800
Suddenly? What happened?

380
00:25:54,040 --> 00:25:57,804
If I remember correctly

381
00:25:57,874 --> 00:26:01,037
I waited for Shanks and the others every single time

382
00:26:01,707 --> 00:26:03,739
But one day...

383
00:26:03,910 --> 00:26:07,984
Welcome back. Do you have any adventure stories to share today?

384
00:26:07,984 --> 00:26:10,216
What's wrong with you guys?

385
00:26:10,256 --> 00:26:12,588
You know what? I'll ask Uta

386
00:26:12,829 --> 00:26:15,892
Uta?

387
00:26:15,892 --> 00:26:18,594
I want to hear about your adventures

388
00:26:18,764 --> 00:26:21,297
Where are you, Uta

389
00:26:23,129 --> 00:26:25,561
Where is Shanks-uta

390
00:26:28,574 --> 00:26:32,438
Did something happen to Uta?

391
00:26:32,538 --> 00:26:39,215
Don't worry Luffy Uta left our ship to become a singer

392
00:26:39,215 --> 00:26:41,217
And just like that...

393
00:26:44,020 --> 00:26:47,784
So Uta why don't you want to be a pirate?

394
00:26:47,794 --> 00:26:50,787
You used to love red-headed One pirate so much

395
00:26:52,258 --> 00:26:55,491
Instead of being a pirate I just decided to be a singer!

396
00:26:55,802 --> 00:27:00,266
Look, I've got fans all over the world in two years

397
00:27:01,637 --> 00:27:04,400
What about you, Luffy? What are you doing now?

398
00:27:04,410 --> 00:27:06,272
Do you have to ask? I'm a sea pirate

399
00:27:08,614 --> 00:27:10,566
To a sea pirate

400
00:27:10,576 --> 00:27:13,449
Yeah, I want to be One Piece

401
00:27:13,449 --> 00:27:16,312
Don't be a sea pirate, Luffy

402
00:27:17,283 --> 00:27:19,585
Let's live happily here together

403
00:27:19,625 --> 00:27:22,588
All of your friends are my fans

404
00:27:22,929 --> 00:27:24,921
It would be fun if we were all together

405
00:27:24,991 --> 00:27:27,864
Wait a minute. Are you listening? Luffy

406
00:27:29,095 --> 00:27:34,871
Uta It's nice to see you again and I'm full so I'm going back to the Thousand SUNS to sleep now

407
00:27:36,402 --> 00:27:38,274
You look like you're doing what you want

408
00:27:38,344 --> 00:27:40,306
I'm happy for you. Goodbye

409
00:27:40,306 --> 00:27:43,109
I won't let you go

410
00:27:43,149 --> 00:27:48,484
Luffy and all of you must stay here forever and be happy with me

411
00:27:48,815 --> 00:27:50,686
What are you talking about, shorty

412
00:27:50,686 --> 00:27:54,720
Uta we love your music but we can't stay here forever

413
00:27:54,821 --> 00:27:56,823
Her beauty

414
00:27:56,993 --> 00:28:02,558
Guys, I found some more pirates. What am I supposed to do?

415
00:28:04,100 --> 00:28:07,463
Uta...

416
00:28:07,473 --> 00:28:13,239
Uta...

417
00:28:13,479 --> 00:28:14,170
Good!

418
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:18,244
Let me defeat these pirates for your sake

419
00:28:30,096 --> 00:28:34,991
I don't care if she's a friend of Luffy's that's too much freedom

420
00:28:38,104 --> 00:28:40,166
What are these things

421
00:28:41,167 --> 00:28:43,039
There are more and more of them

422
00:28:43,169 --> 00:28:45,571
Tang Cao Wa is boxing

423
00:28:49,205 --> 00:28:51,247
Sore fingers

424
00:28:53,779 --> 00:28:55,081
luffy

425
00:28:55,781 --> 00:28:57,854
You shouldn't be a sea pirate

426
00:28:57,854 --> 00:29:00,857
If you're my friend, give up being a sea pirate

427
00:29:01,948 --> 00:29:02,919
What are you talking about?

428
00:29:05,431 --> 00:29:07,723
I gave it up. It was boring

429
00:29:08,134 --> 00:29:10,356
I have no reason to fight you

430
00:29:10,436 --> 00:29:14,120
I'm gonna keep fighting even if you don't do anything

431
00:29:31,247 --> 00:29:34,190
Six rounds of flowers. Slap in the face

432
00:29:39,225 --> 00:29:40,957
Stop playing uta

433
00:29:42,328 --> 00:29:47,864
"Sad memories are like passing through sorrow."

434
00:29:48,004 --> 00:29:53,039
"Can't let go of the resentment and the gloom in my heart."

435
00:29:53,079 --> 00:29:54,871
"Because of him."

436
00:29:54,881 --> 00:29:58,144
"You have no idea, do you? The heartbreaking loneliness."

437
00:29:58,184 --> 00:30:01,077
"Now is the time to unbind."

438
00:30:01,117 --> 00:30:05,451
"Anger, right now."

439
00:30:05,621 --> 00:30:11,327
"Blow these bad guys out of the sky. This is the punishment of love. I don't want to sleep anymore."

440
00:30:11,327 --> 00:30:15,131
"There's no more sadness, there's no more sadness."

441
00:30:15,261 --> 00:30:18,334
"Yeah, anger. Right now."

442
00:30:18,364 --> 00:30:24,300
"Kick the bad guy in the air. That's the punishment of love. I don't want to sleep anymore."

443
00:30:24,310 --> 00:30:33,649
"Don't feel lonely no lonely backlight ah"

444
00:30:43,779 --> 00:30:47,343
What the hell are you doing Let go of me

445
00:30:47,443 --> 00:30:51,047
Luffy can't be One Piece

446
00:30:53,149 --> 00:30:56,252
Hey, guys, what do you think about pirates

447
00:30:57,153 --> 00:30:59,185
My city was destroyed by pirates

448
00:30:59,625 --> 00:31:02,058
My husband was killed by a pirate

449
00:31:02,558 --> 00:31:04,290
Give me back my mother

450
00:31:04,300 --> 00:31:09,265
Don't let a pirate drive away a pirate

451
00:31:09,535 --> 00:31:13,840
Princess Luffy Uta did none of those things

452
00:31:13,910 --> 00:31:16,973
Uta, my friend

453
00:31:17,373 --> 00:31:20,646
You stay away from Uta you pirates

454
00:31:22,348 --> 00:31:25,551
You are a demon fruit user who will weaken in the sea and we will not fear you

455
00:31:25,551 --> 00:31:27,583
Hey, no.

456
00:31:27,623 --> 00:31:28,184
We're screwed.

457
00:31:28,624 --> 00:31:29,115
Wait a minute

458
00:31:29,125 --> 00:31:32,859
It's gonna be okay. Let's just see what happens, okay

459
00:31:33,129 --> 00:31:35,591
Ball of protection

460
00:31:37,163 --> 00:31:38,795
Lomeo

461
00:31:38,734 --> 00:31:43,930
Uta is really running wild and I don't think we can beat her

462
00:31:43,940 --> 00:31:46,502
I haven't... Lose,

463
00:31:46,702 --> 00:31:49,475
There you go again with the sore loser

464
00:31:56,512 --> 00:31:58,544
They're gone. Where did they go? The pirate escaped

465
00:31:59,715 --> 00:32:00,716
There are even hidden pirates

466
00:32:05,591 --> 00:32:08,594
What? Where are we?

467
00:32:12,698 --> 00:32:16,432
Are you a Uta fan too, Trafalgar?

468
00:32:16,502 --> 00:32:18,264
No, I'm just going along

469
00:32:22,438 --> 00:32:23,769
I'm here to keep paypal company

470
00:32:23,779 --> 00:32:24,911
Excuse me

471
00:32:24,911 --> 00:32:27,814
Thank you very much!

472
00:32:27,914 --> 00:32:29,876
This is no time to laugh, straw hat boy

473
00:32:29,986 --> 00:32:32,418
If we can't figure out what that girl's powers are...

474
00:32:34,550 --> 00:32:38,054
Leave it to me because I've beaten her 184 times in a row

475
00:32:38,124 --> 00:32:38,955
There you are!

476
00:32:38,995 --> 00:32:40,756
There you are.

477
00:32:40,456 --> 00:32:42,428
Luffy senior Uta baby captain

478
00:32:42,959 --> 00:32:43,729
Let's go

479
00:32:43,900 --> 00:32:45,391
The sea pirate escaped

480
00:32:45,431 --> 00:32:47,964
Let's go get them together

481
00:33:12,859 --> 00:33:15,561
SWORD's phone bug hasn't been working

482
00:33:15,661 --> 00:33:19,595
Well, that's too bad it looks like Uta's really gonna go through with her plan

483
00:33:19,595 --> 00:33:24,130
SWORD has been watching Uta, too

484
00:33:24,140 --> 00:33:27,103
Aren't you from Cipher Pol What are they trying to do?

485
00:33:27,103 --> 00:33:32,979
Isn't it time for a turf war where you can't use your doorfruit abilities

486
00:33:32,979 --> 00:33:34,610
Maybe you know too much

487
00:33:34,610 --> 00:33:36,342
And so do you.

488
00:33:37,253 --> 00:33:41,247
I could but it's gonna take a lot of energy out of me

489
00:33:42,488 --> 00:33:45,121
So what do we do

490
00:33:46,592 --> 00:33:50,096
Gather our men first that's all we can do right now

491
00:33:51,497 --> 00:33:54,600
It's a headache. They got caught

492
00:33:54,770 --> 00:33:58,865
It looks like they're just stuck to that rope so they'll be fine

493
00:33:58,875 --> 00:34:06,542
I didn't think that one day I could take the road to fly away I was so moved that I couldn't see the front straw hat boy

494
00:34:07,083 --> 00:34:08,073
thank you

495
00:34:11,746 --> 00:34:13,578
What are you doing, please

496
00:34:28,835 --> 00:34:32,738
Wow, that's a lot.

497
00:34:32,738 --> 00:34:34,670
We'll be surrounded if we keep this up

498
00:34:35,171 --> 00:34:36,672
Here you go.

499
00:34:44,750 --> 00:34:47,512
It's a good thing you saved us

500
00:34:47,612 --> 00:34:49,415
You said you were Luffy, right

501
00:34:49,425 --> 00:34:50,416
Yes.

502
00:34:50,426 --> 00:34:50,987
And you?

503
00:34:50,987 --> 00:34:52,989
Who are you

504
00:34:53,118 --> 00:35:00,266
I was king of the kingdom of Eligia My name was Gordon

505
00:35:00,396 --> 00:35:04,200
What kingdom has some buildings but no people

506
00:35:04,240 --> 00:35:05,371
You're wrong.

507
00:35:05,371 --> 00:35:09,535
Eligia was once the number one music island in the world

508
00:35:09,545 --> 00:35:12,038
But it all disappeared overnight

509
00:35:12,278 --> 00:35:14,811
A kingdom that big just disappeared in one night

510
00:35:14,811 --> 00:35:18,414
There's a rumor that they were attacked by pirates

511
00:35:25,521 --> 00:35:27,353
Let's talk about Uta

512
00:35:28,024 --> 00:35:30,897
When Eligia was empty

513
00:35:30,897 --> 00:35:33,159
I'm the one who raised Uta

514
00:35:33,269 --> 00:35:34,100
Are you?

515
00:35:34,370 --> 00:35:38,634
It's just the two of us on this island

516
00:35:39,275 --> 00:35:44,410
She's supposed to feel very alone and she's pretending to be strong for me

517
00:35:44,440 --> 00:35:49,846
But when she's alone she sings about her friends

518
00:35:50,746 --> 00:35:59,255
"I think of us playing by the sea."

519
00:35:59,455 --> 00:36:02,859
"Just you and me."

520
00:36:02,859 --> 00:36:11,497
"But the smell of the sea is fading away."

521
00:36:11,507 --> 00:36:14,570
"Slowly slipping away"

522
00:36:14,570 --> 00:36:18,604
"So I sang a familiar song

523
00:36:18,644 --> 00:36:20,807
"Hope you can hear me."

524
00:36:20,847 --> 00:36:26,853
"I'll sing till you come back to me."

525
00:36:26,923 --> 00:36:30,186
To encourage Uta

526
00:36:30,286 --> 00:36:33,790
I made her the best singer in the world

527
00:36:37,633 --> 00:36:39,625
Hello? Are you listening?

528
00:36:39,836 --> 00:36:42,398
Just go ahead and ignore us

529
00:36:45,441 --> 00:36:46,772
I'm sorry

530
00:36:46,772 --> 00:36:51,637
Anyway, Uta doesn't seem to have any idea what Luffy's doing, does he?

531
00:36:54,710 --> 00:36:55,581
I'm sorry

532
00:36:57,884 --> 00:37:03,950
My problem at that time was that I didn't know when and how to deliver her songs to the world

533
00:37:03,990 --> 00:37:08,724
After all, she grew up without knowing anything about the outside world

534
00:37:08,895 --> 00:37:13,729
But the timing was sudden

535
00:37:17,874 --> 00:37:21,868
She happened to pick one up two years ago

536
00:37:21,878 --> 00:37:25,471
The new image of the phone bug washes ashore

537
00:37:25,511 --> 00:37:34,080
Uta was liberated to broadcast her music to the outside world

538
00:37:34,150 --> 00:37:36,622
Her fans love her voice

539
00:37:36,652 --> 00:37:42,488
It's as if the sound she transmits is all around the world

540
00:37:42,498 --> 00:37:44,130
Thank you, Uta

541
00:37:44,130 --> 00:37:45,491
I feel much better

542
00:37:45,501 --> 00:37:49,996
Thank you Uta because you're the reason I'm alive

543
00:37:50,036 --> 00:37:54,340
Me too. I'm glad people are so happy...

544
00:37:57,663 --> 00:38:06,082
A new consciousness had sprung up within her that the age of the Great pirate was full of war and violence

545
00:38:06,222 --> 00:38:09,986
It was meant to be heard by others

546
00:38:11,858 --> 00:38:19,665
But somewhere along the way, more and more of Uta's fans started calling her the savior

547
00:38:19,665 --> 00:38:20,296
And Uta just...

548
00:38:21,938 --> 00:38:24,871
I understand your feelings very well

549
00:38:24,901 --> 00:38:28,634
If you want me to do it a new era

550
00:38:28,644 --> 00:38:31,978
Please stop Uta's plan

551
00:38:31,978 --> 00:38:34,981
Luffy, you're her friend and I know you can do it

552
00:38:35,051 --> 00:38:38,344
Is that the concert you're talking about?

553
00:38:40,256 --> 00:38:41,217
I'm sorry

554
00:38:41,587 --> 00:38:43,249
paypal

555
00:38:46,192 --> 00:38:47,553
Ah cho

556
00:38:47,593 --> 00:38:49,625
The paypal Bear

557
00:38:54,230 --> 00:38:55,401
utta

558
00:38:55,471 --> 00:39:03,669
Uta, why did you leave Shanks's ship

559
00:39:03,810 --> 00:39:10,016
I thought you said you wanted to be the Gorgie of the Red-headed One Piece and go back to Shanks

560
00:39:11,217 --> 00:39:16,522
Shut up. I don't want to talk about it

561
00:39:33,209 --> 00:39:36,142
Forget all this boring stuff

562
00:39:38,274 --> 00:39:44,480
We can eat delicious food and play chicken contests and arm wrestle and live happily as before

563
00:39:44,680 --> 00:39:47,784
Give me my hat back Shanks 'hat

564
00:39:48,224 --> 00:39:54,490
Well, Luffy New Era doesn't need you

565
00:39:54,560 --> 00:39:57,693
ROOM migration

566
00:39:59,565 --> 00:40:01,027
Where did they go?

567
00:40:01,037 --> 00:40:03,029
Did the pirates escape?

568
00:40:03,039 --> 00:40:06,232
Looks like they have a lot of different abilities

569
00:40:06,242 --> 00:40:11,637
Forget it let's just make a game of it and find the escaped pirates

570
00:40:19,415 --> 00:40:21,818
Let me out. I want my hat back

571
00:40:21,818 --> 00:40:25,521
Shut up You can't do that That's why I put you in here

572
00:40:25,521 --> 00:40:27,753
We just kept running...

573
00:40:28,795 --> 00:40:29,425
There's a harbor on the other side of the island. Let's go that way

574
00:40:30,026 --> 00:40:30,827
What port?

575
00:40:30,867 --> 00:40:34,230
The Navy and the secret Service were at the concert

576
00:40:34,230 --> 00:40:35,561
What are you talking about

577
00:40:35,571 --> 00:40:39,705
Governments and navies around the world are watching Uta's capabilities

578
00:40:39,906 --> 00:40:42,338
They watched her as if she were dangerous

579
00:40:42,378 --> 00:40:45,041
So they're here to scout

580
00:40:45,281 --> 00:40:47,373
I think they're somewhere around the island

581
00:40:47,383 --> 00:40:50,416
If we can find the Navy we can find a way to get them to give us some Intel on Utta's capabilities

582
00:40:50,516 --> 00:40:52,178
Not over there

583
00:40:53,649 --> 00:40:55,051
Oops

584
00:40:55,051 --> 00:40:58,154
Don't worry, my ball shield is pretty strong

585
00:40:58,154 --> 00:41:02,358
But it won't stop

586
00:41:08,464 --> 00:41:11,237
It's so tall.

587
00:41:22,118 --> 00:41:27,413
Luffy senior hold on, hold on

588
00:41:34,260 --> 00:41:39,195
Gordon are you still mad at me for throwing this concert without consulting you?

589
00:41:39,195 --> 00:41:41,527
It's not an easy concert, is it

590
00:41:41,537 --> 00:41:45,701
I see you found out that you're on my side, right

591
00:41:47,343 --> 00:41:50,907
I... I...

592
00:41:51,107 --> 00:41:54,140
It would have been easy for you to just run away

593
00:41:54,210 --> 00:41:58,144
I don't want you to do this

594
00:41:58,184 --> 00:41:59,645
But...

595
00:41:59,685 --> 00:42:01,117
You just stay here for the time being

596
00:42:01,858 --> 00:42:04,190
The governments and navies of the world will not stand idly by

597
00:42:05,191 --> 00:42:07,093
It doesn't matter because I have this

598
00:42:08,524 --> 00:42:11,898
This is Tol Musica

599
00:42:12,228 --> 00:42:18,004
I always knew it was buried under this castle. Why didn't you throw it away?

600
00:42:18,134 --> 00:42:22,508
Isn't it because you have new age ideals, too?

601
00:42:23,779 --> 00:42:26,042
Uta you can't use it

602
00:42:26,212 --> 00:42:28,744
uttar

603
00:42:29,015 --> 00:42:30,817
Ah Autumn...

604
00:42:34,821 --> 00:42:37,423
This ocean is so vast

605
00:42:37,423 --> 00:42:40,526
Forget the Navy there's not a soul here

606
00:42:41,227 --> 00:42:41,757
Let me ask you something.

607
00:42:41,757 --> 00:42:42,288
What's going on?

608
00:42:42,298 --> 00:42:44,030
The Thousand Yang is gone

609
00:42:44,030 --> 00:42:45,962
Is it your boat

610
00:42:47,433 --> 00:42:49,065
The regionalization

611
00:42:50,266 --> 00:42:50,897
what

612
00:42:50,907 --> 00:42:56,402
A thousand Yang, a thousand Yang

613
00:42:57,013 --> 00:42:57,303
Really?

614
00:42:57,343 --> 00:42:59,745
Are you really a thousand SUNS

615
00:42:59,816 --> 00:43:05,081
Is that Uta's power again? I'm going crazy

616
00:43:05,051 --> 00:43:07,113
The regionalization

617
00:43:08,124 --> 00:43:09,916
Report to the forward deck lookout

618
00:43:09,926 --> 00:43:12,618
No enemy duplication was found

619
00:43:12,688 --> 00:43:15,121
No enemy was found

620
00:43:15,191 --> 00:43:18,224
Watch the back of the ship for any raids

621
00:43:18,264 --> 00:43:22,368
Prepare for land battle Deploy the first squadron to make sure the beaches are secure as soon as they arrive

622
00:43:22,498 --> 00:43:25,731
The second team entered the island when the beach was secured

623
00:43:25,741 --> 00:43:27,403
Armed Recon 2 continues its search with no sign of the enemy

624
00:43:27,403 --> 00:43:30,506
Armed Recon Three is in and there's no sign of the enemy

625
00:43:30,576 --> 00:43:32,608
We continued to advance but could not confirm any sign of the enemy or what looked like the enemy

626
00:43:32,608 --> 00:43:34,380
Waiting for the next command

627
00:43:39,956 --> 00:43:43,119
This is... What is this...

628
00:44:01,207 --> 00:44:04,110
This is Armed Recon Seven We have no information on the people of Eligia

629
00:44:04,110 --> 00:44:07,743
This is Armed Recon two and we have no sign of the enemy

630
00:44:07,743 --> 00:44:10,246
This is Armed Recon Four reporting to Lieutenant Ratty

631
00:44:10,246 --> 00:44:12,748
The audience is not awake and can't wake up Repeat they can't wake up

632
00:44:12,748 --> 00:44:14,450
I don't think they're dead

633
00:44:14,450 --> 00:44:16,452
They just fell asleep

634
00:44:16,452 --> 00:44:18,624
But they're never gonna get up

635
00:44:20,256 --> 00:44:25,291
If you kill me these souls will never return

636
00:44:25,401 --> 00:44:27,093
Is that okay

637
00:44:27,163 --> 00:44:27,964
The little girl

638
00:44:28,905 --> 00:44:34,140
I know all too well what your demon fruit can do

639
00:44:34,340 --> 00:44:38,004
Then you don't need me to explain, do you? Go home

640
00:44:38,044 --> 00:44:43,810
After all, I'll be gone soon

641
00:44:44,981 --> 00:44:48,084
Am I getting a wakeful mushroom

642
00:44:48,324 --> 00:44:49,956
What are wakeful mushrooms

643
00:44:50,186 --> 00:44:56,622
People who eat these mushrooms can't sleep and die from exhaustion

644
00:44:56,692 --> 00:44:57,964
What are you...

645
00:44:57,994 --> 00:45:00,596
Are you going to kill yourself and take the whole audience with you?

646
00:45:00,596 --> 00:45:05,331
What? Your soul is more important than your body, isn't it?

647
00:45:05,371 --> 00:45:09,435
In the new age every soul will live forever

648
00:45:09,675 --> 00:45:16,012
I'm trying to solve this problem without violence if you could just drop it

649
00:45:16,012 --> 00:45:18,284
Stop your plan to destroy the world

650
00:45:18,284 --> 00:45:19,846
What are you talking about?

651
00:45:19,986 --> 00:45:23,689
I just want people to be happy

652
00:45:23,689 --> 00:45:27,854
It seems you don't want to listen to our advice

653
00:45:27,924 --> 00:45:30,196
So are you

654
00:45:30,196 --> 00:45:32,098
Don't worry

655
00:45:33,099 --> 00:45:36,062
You can't do anything to me as long as we can't hear you

656
00:45:36,132 --> 00:45:38,504
Unfortunately, it was too late

657
00:45:40,676 --> 00:45:44,770
What do you mean, General Kirby

658
00:45:47,583 --> 00:45:49,846
Guys, there are bad guys here

659
00:45:50,386 --> 00:45:53,249
Let's get them for the new era

660
00:45:54,851 --> 00:46:00,686
Don't hurt them they're just innocent citizens being controlled

661
00:46:06,762 --> 00:46:12,568
"I've given up being alone. I want to be with someone else."

662
00:46:12,568 --> 00:46:15,541
"I want a real relationship so let me take my feelings"

663
00:46:15,541 --> 00:46:17,273
"Sing it all out (shout it out)"

664
00:46:19,015 --> 00:46:22,008
"Listen, baby, I'm gonna make you happy whether you like it or not."

665
00:46:22,018 --> 00:46:24,350
"Sneak up on you, keep you from escaping and wait for the beat."

666
00:46:24,620 --> 00:46:28,014
"Listen to the surprise every word will bring you to me."

667
00:46:28,084 --> 00:46:29,555
"(Oh) Be my sweet little boy and girl."

668
00:46:30,386 --> 00:46:34,090
"Do you think you're good but I'm tired of it?"

669
00:46:34,130 --> 00:46:37,894
"I got something better here. Come on. We can sing together."

670
00:46:37,934 --> 00:46:43,229
"Let's unpack the fun and get on stage together. Let's go."

671
00:46:43,669 --> 00:46:44,971
"(Aha) I want to make you happy."

672
00:46:45,001 --> 00:46:46,232
"Do it proudly with me."

673
00:46:46,242 --> 00:46:49,205
"(Hey) Tell me is it hard to live here?"

674
00:46:49,245 --> 00:46:53,880
"Isn't this the country of our dreams?"

675
00:46:53,980 --> 00:46:57,483
"It's been on the way a long time. It's time to stay. You can't deny it."

676
00:46:59,816 --> 00:47:02,648
"It's a miracle of mercy that you can't stop even if you try to stop it."

677
00:47:02,718 --> 00:47:05,621
"I don't think that's too much to wish for."

678
00:47:05,621 --> 00:47:09,055
"The Savior has come to this age."

679
00:47:09,125 --> 00:47:11,197
"I screamed for salvation."

680
00:47:11,267 --> 00:47:13,529
"Because no one ever heard me scream."

681
00:47:15,031 --> 00:47:16,132
"But that's not true anymore."

682
00:47:16,232 --> 00:47:18,454
"I have to do this. They can't do it anymore."

683
00:47:18,574 --> 00:47:21,767
"Stop me and get out of my way."

684
00:47:21,938 --> 00:47:26,712
"There's no going back now let's sing together forever."

685
00:47:26,782 --> 00:47:30,046
"Let the bass rock your head and the drums break your eardrums."

686
00:47:30,186 --> 00:47:33,119
"Let those brass instruments touch your heart."

687
00:47:33,689 --> 00:47:35,751
"Let me hear you scream oh wow!"

688
00:47:37,924 --> 00:47:40,126
"Don't be brainwashed into telling the truth."

689
00:47:40,196 --> 00:47:43,029
"Let me erase all traces of your brainwashing and stop listening to their lies."

690
00:47:43,029 --> 00:47:46,893
"Look up and let my song bring back your consciousness that's what you need."

691
00:47:46,933 --> 00:47:49,495
"This is my real voice."

692
00:47:51,607 --> 00:47:54,400
Damn it This is bad I can't get out of here

693
00:47:54,540 --> 00:47:56,672
This is so useless with your curly eyebrows

694
00:47:56,672 --> 00:47:59,675
You can't get down either, you mossy head

695
00:47:59,705 --> 00:48:03,149
So can Fledge and Jiping move

696
00:48:03,219 --> 00:48:04,410
I can't move

697
00:48:04,921 --> 00:48:07,753
I'm Brooke, too

698
00:48:07,954 --> 00:48:09,485
Let's try again

699
00:48:11,257 --> 00:48:14,690
Can you break free? I was so close to seeing Nami's underwear

700
00:48:14,760 --> 00:48:15,691
what?

701
00:48:15,761 --> 00:48:19,195
If you see that, I'll blow you out of the sky

702
00:48:20,696 --> 00:48:21,167
Can I say something

703
00:48:21,197 --> 00:48:24,530
Didn't Uta say, "Let me create a song"

704
00:48:24,540 --> 00:48:28,304
I don't think that means it's a sheet music

705
00:48:28,404 --> 00:48:31,607
It does look like a melody

706
00:48:31,607 --> 00:48:34,480
The position of our head may be a note

707
00:48:35,311 --> 00:48:36,612
Brooke, can you sing it?

708
00:48:36,612 --> 00:48:39,645
But I can't see the whole score

709
00:48:39,615 --> 00:48:41,848
All I can see now is...

710
00:48:42,258 --> 00:48:44,020
You shut up and don't look at your underwear

711
00:48:44,060 --> 00:48:47,493
Sure enough, the Straw Hat Pirates were able to discover that it was a musical score

712
00:48:47,663 --> 00:48:49,295
what?

713
00:48:49,365 --> 00:48:51,527
You guys... Why with Bruno?

714
00:48:51,627 --> 00:48:52,929
I'll explain that later

715
00:48:53,069 --> 00:48:55,731
Come on, sing

716
00:48:55,731 --> 00:48:58,434
The mi to

717
00:48:58,474 --> 00:49:01,067
Here we go.

718
00:49:01,607 --> 00:49:03,269
Free to go

719
00:49:03,279 --> 00:49:06,112
Good Brooke go ahead

720
00:49:06,582 --> 00:49:11,447
Did you hear about that girl's power

721
00:49:12,488 --> 00:49:14,750
Did you put my sister in a bag

722
00:49:14,791 --> 00:49:16,152
The elder brother

723
00:49:18,054 --> 00:49:20,787
Just this once but only if you cooperate with the Navy

724
00:49:22,999 --> 00:49:29,265
Mia Ah Cho

725
00:49:29,305 --> 00:49:31,938
Do I... The mi...

726
00:49:33,239 --> 00:49:36,302
Thank you. You really are a very capable bear

727
00:49:36,472 --> 00:49:36,742
Hello hello

728
00:49:42,748 --> 00:49:45,852
Why?... I'm in here again...

729
00:49:46,122 --> 00:49:51,417
We don't know what Uta is capable of so we can't let you out

730
00:49:51,487 --> 00:49:54,190
A thousand SUNS... A thousand SUNS?

731
00:49:55,691 --> 00:49:57,663
Why are you guys here

732
00:49:57,663 --> 00:49:59,665
Long time no see Luffy

733
00:50:01,237 --> 00:50:04,931
Kirby helped me get me out of here

734
00:50:05,041 --> 00:50:07,533
How did you know to come here?

735
00:50:07,703 --> 00:50:08,504
I sensed Luffy

736
00:50:08,504 --> 00:50:10,336
The original is used to see color domineering

737
00:50:10,546 --> 00:50:14,480
And then I borrowed Bruno's doorfruit power

738
00:50:14,680 --> 00:50:19,345
Door door let me out

739
00:50:19,485 --> 00:50:24,720
Cipher Pol is working with the Navy What's going on here?

740
00:50:24,660 --> 00:50:28,354
Everybody wants to know what Uta can do, right

741
00:50:28,594 --> 00:50:32,158
You know what Uta is capable of... what

742
00:50:32,598 --> 00:50:38,304
You may not believe this but the world we live in isn't real

743
00:50:39,075 --> 00:50:39,565
what

744
00:50:39,635 --> 00:50:50,316
What you see is not reality The world Uta created with her powers

745
00:50:50,386 --> 00:50:56,983
The ability to sing fruit allows the singer to transport the soul of the person who hears the song to sing about the world

746
00:50:57,093 --> 00:51:02,558
The souls that are transported will feel like they're still alive

747
00:51:02,558 --> 00:51:05,731
But not in the real world but in the world Uta created

748
00:51:05,501 --> 00:51:10,066
It's like everyone's having the same dream

749
00:51:10,766 --> 00:51:15,301
I think Uta said she could do it

750
00:51:15,311 --> 00:51:15,842
what?

751
00:51:15,872 --> 00:51:20,947
I mean when someone hears her sing they go to sleep

752
00:51:20,947 --> 00:51:23,880
If you knew why didn't you say so

753
00:51:23,920 --> 00:51:25,882
Sorry, I forgot.

754
00:51:25,922 --> 00:51:29,055
So what's going on in the real world?

755
00:51:29,055 --> 00:51:32,989
Our bodies stay in the real world

756
00:51:33,289 --> 00:51:37,023
But they're all controlled by Uta

757
00:51:37,033 --> 00:51:39,025
So how do we get back to reality?

758
00:51:39,165 --> 00:51:42,728
If Uta falls asleep her powers will be taken away

759
00:51:42,768 --> 00:51:50,036
But because we've been trapped in this world of singing fruit we can't lay a hand on the real Uta

760
00:51:50,106 --> 00:51:54,280
The devil fruit has to have its limits, right

761
00:51:54,280 --> 00:51:56,242
Yes.

762
00:51:56,382 --> 00:51:59,786
It takes a lot of energy to maintain this world of singing fruit

763
00:51:59,816 --> 00:52:03,689
It's like I can't use my door fruit ability all the time

764
00:52:03,960 --> 00:52:07,153
So all it takes is Uta to get tired and go to sleep

765
00:52:07,123 --> 00:52:12,698
Well, that's a conundrum because I confirmed that she ate sober mushrooms before her concert even started

766
00:52:12,829 --> 00:52:16,662
That mushroom will keep you awake

767
00:52:16,772 --> 00:52:22,108
The real world Uta will soon be dead

768
00:52:22,408 --> 00:52:23,910
To die?

769
00:52:24,981 --> 00:52:25,441
Is Uta going to die?

770
00:52:26,482 --> 00:52:28,274
Can we get out of here if she's dead?

771
00:52:28,314 --> 00:52:30,376
No, it's the opposite

772
00:52:30,546 --> 00:52:33,479
If Uta dies the world will shut down

773
00:52:33,489 --> 00:52:36,923
Everyone in here will be there

774
00:52:37,123 --> 00:52:40,386
Including us would be stuck here

775
00:52:40,526 --> 00:52:44,861
Her fans would be trapped forever in this world of singing fruit

776
00:52:44,861 --> 00:52:48,364
This is Uta's plan

777
00:52:49,105 --> 00:52:50,837
It's crazy

778
00:52:50,907 --> 00:52:54,000
Kirby How are we gonna stop Uta

779
00:52:54,010 --> 00:52:59,345
I snuck in here to find her weakness and I didn't find anything, you know

780
00:52:59,345 --> 00:53:05,952
I just knew we had to at least get our people together so I got Hilumebo working with the other Pirates

781
00:53:05,982 --> 00:53:08,885
As for the Straw Hat Pirates they have their own operation

782
00:53:08,925 --> 00:53:11,117
Looks like they're all right

783
00:53:11,427 --> 00:53:13,219
They headed for the castle of Eligia

784
00:53:13,830 --> 00:53:18,825
Nicole Robin seems to know what happened to this island in the past

785
00:53:18,965 --> 00:53:26,032
If there were records we might have a way to beat Uta

786
00:53:26,272 --> 00:53:28,334
But the chances are slim

787
00:53:28,344 --> 00:53:30,636
Can you trust Robin you mossy white head?

788
00:53:30,646 --> 00:53:32,708
It's a fact you have beautiful eyebrows

789
00:53:32,708 --> 00:53:35,611
There is a room with many books

790
00:53:40,917 --> 00:53:48,855
Guys let's forget about the sea pirate and wait for a new era

791
00:53:50,466 --> 00:53:52,859
How long before the real Uta dies?

792
00:53:52,999 --> 00:53:55,501
Less than two hours

793
00:54:01,737 --> 00:54:05,972
The sound insulation here is well done

794
00:54:06,142 --> 00:54:09,545
Looks like Uta can't reach this place

795
00:54:09,615 --> 00:54:11,417
The Navy says she's safe where her voice can't be heard

796
00:54:11,517 --> 00:54:14,320
Are these old records?

797
00:54:14,450 --> 00:54:17,223
How are we gonna find what we need?

798
00:54:25,301 --> 00:54:27,984
Three knife flow extremely tiger hunting

799
00:54:32,508 --> 00:54:33,569
Demon wind foot

800
00:54:33,569 --> 00:54:37,273
Fried assorted platter

801
00:54:37,413 --> 00:54:41,477
Strong right hand weapon left hand

802
00:54:42,919 --> 00:54:45,181
Robin, you go find that book

803
00:54:45,251 --> 00:54:46,382
But Robin

804
00:54:46,582 --> 00:54:49,585
I won't let them hurt a hair on your head Don't worry

805
00:55:02,809 --> 00:55:06,072
Very quickly... The bad guys will disappear and a new era will dawn

806
00:55:06,082 --> 00:55:10,116
Can you hear me? Uta probably has an hour to live, Max

807
00:55:10,286 --> 00:55:14,650
But those phone bugs with their souls are out of control

808
00:55:14,720 --> 00:55:17,583
They keep showing videos of Uta singing about the fruit world

809
00:55:17,693 --> 00:55:22,158
"It's dangerous if you don't turn the sound off and your soul is taken away as soon as you hear that song."

810
00:55:25,261 --> 00:55:27,633
"Listen, baby, I'm gonna make you happy whether you like it or not."

811
00:55:27,633 --> 00:55:30,296
"Snuck up on you, didn't let you run and waited for the beat."

812
00:55:30,336 --> 00:55:33,439
"Listen to the surprise every word will lead you to me."

813
00:55:33,469 --> 00:55:36,202
"Be my sweet little boy and girl."

814
00:55:36,212 --> 00:55:40,346
"Do you think you're good but I'm tired of it?"

815
00:55:40,416 --> 00:55:42,108
"I got something better here."

816
00:55:42,448 --> 00:55:45,151
"Come on we can sing it out"

817
00:55:45,721 --> 00:55:49,085
"Let's get on the stage. Let's go.""

818
00:55:49,725 --> 00:55:53,219
Uta's concert has been going on for over six hours

819
00:55:53,229 --> 00:55:55,992
The number of victims continues to grow

820
00:55:56,092 --> 00:56:03,399
If this goes on for one more hour, 70% of the population will be teleporting to the world of singing fruit

821
00:56:03,469 --> 00:56:06,632
Seventy percent? That's more than we thought

822
00:56:06,672 --> 00:56:08,474
The world is going to be wiped out

823
00:56:08,604 --> 00:56:11,037
We have to do something to stop her, okay

824
00:57:16,172 --> 00:57:19,265
I told you that stuff doesn't work here

825
00:57:23,079 --> 00:57:26,472
If I can't use you then I don't need you

826
00:57:27,283 --> 00:57:29,745
What are you doing?

827
00:57:29,986 --> 00:57:32,248
Are you okay? I'm here to help you

828
00:57:34,410 --> 00:57:38,214
What are you marines doing killing this kid?

829
00:57:41,287 --> 00:57:45,251
Didn't your navy say you'd be on the right side?

830
00:57:48,234 --> 00:57:51,838
But the Dragons are like the gods of this world

831
00:57:52,368 --> 00:57:52,839
I see

832
00:57:53,109 --> 00:57:58,174
So you don't really want to do this guy's bidding? Okay, it's okay

833
00:57:58,274 --> 00:58:02,448
In the new era, dragons and slaves are equal

834
00:58:02,548 --> 00:58:04,881
What equality is so gross?

835
00:58:06,282 --> 00:58:08,154
You have to kill her now

836
00:58:08,254 --> 00:58:10,456
I'm sorry

837
00:58:25,171 --> 00:58:26,282
Don't think I'll let you off the hook

838
00:58:31,407 --> 00:58:36,212
Guys you have nothing to fear from these dragons

839
00:58:39,185 --> 00:58:41,617
You can't do that, Uta

840
00:58:41,757 --> 00:58:43,589
If you hurt the Draconians

841
00:58:43,589 --> 00:58:46,252
World governments and navies will come after you

842
00:58:46,592 --> 00:58:48,094
I told you it was gonna be okay

843
00:58:48,324 --> 00:58:49,095
Sorry, Uta.

844
00:58:49,625 --> 00:58:55,401
I got to get back to my flock

845
00:58:55,431 --> 00:58:57,703
Thank you. It was a really fun concert

846
00:58:57,703 --> 00:59:00,406
Wait a minute. I don't understand what you're talking about

847
00:59:01,407 --> 00:59:07,013
Why would you go back and have a hard life when you can enjoy it here?

848
00:59:07,013 --> 00:59:10,917
Did you not see that I caught these pirates?

849
00:59:10,917 --> 00:59:11,217
Did you not see that I caught these pirates?

850
00:59:14,120 --> 00:59:17,053
It's time for Uta to stop

851
00:59:17,723 --> 00:59:20,787
You're the navy and you're here to save the Draconians

852
00:59:20,897 --> 00:59:23,389
I'm here to save everyone here

853
00:59:23,830 --> 00:59:28,464
You send all the souls back to the real world

854
00:59:28,464 --> 00:59:29,765
General Kirby

855
00:59:29,836 --> 00:59:30,436
what

856
00:59:30,666 --> 00:59:33,169
It's really General Kirby. It's Kirby

857
00:59:35,371 --> 00:59:37,243
Are you a famous person?

858
00:59:37,373 --> 00:59:42,008
He was the hero who saved the lives of many citizens at Lodgepole

859
00:59:42,018 --> 00:59:48,054
I see. I've been in Algia the whole time so I don't know about the news

860
00:59:48,364 --> 00:59:49,755
ok

861
00:59:49,755 --> 00:59:51,918
Feed the hero

862
00:59:51,928 --> 00:59:55,521
I'm using up too much power you tell them

863
00:59:55,992 --> 00:59:56,722
good

864
00:59:57,263 --> 00:59:59,725
Listen to me, everybody

865
00:59:59,765 --> 01:00:04,230
The world you live in is a fake one

866
01:00:10,706 --> 01:00:13,179
You've been duped

867
01:00:13,209 --> 01:00:17,213
We have to get out of here

868
01:00:17,253 --> 01:00:21,247
Uta did you really lie to us and keep us here

869
01:00:21,287 --> 01:00:24,791
I'm not lying to you I'm not lying to anyone

870
01:00:24,991 --> 01:00:29,856
No, you guys I'm just trying to lead you to happiness

871
01:00:33,900 --> 01:00:36,062
Isn't this what everyone wants

872
01:00:36,202 --> 01:00:41,507
The time of the Great Sea pirate is over and now it is the time of peace and freedom

873
01:00:42,508 --> 01:00:46,712
Isn't that great? All the good food and fun things are here

874
01:00:46,742 --> 01:00:51,017
No one here does bad things no pain no pain

875
01:00:51,017 --> 01:00:54,020
Yeah, I think I'll be happy here

876
01:00:54,450 --> 01:00:54,921
Me too.

877
01:00:55,521 --> 01:00:56,622
So it is

878
01:00:56,853 --> 01:00:58,554
But I have work to do

879
01:00:58,925 --> 01:01:03,059
I told you you don't have to work and you don't have to study

880
01:01:03,059 --> 01:01:05,431
Even so, we can't stay here forever

881
01:01:05,531 --> 01:01:07,533
I still have something I'm working on

882
01:01:07,563 --> 01:01:09,435
It's not so good to play all day

883
01:01:09,435 --> 01:01:10,797
I want to go home...

884
01:01:10,807 --> 01:01:12,869
Letting society end completely is kind of

885
01:01:13,469 --> 01:01:14,340
I don't think I can do that

886
01:01:14,370 --> 01:01:16,542
I do like Uta but this is crossing a line

887
01:01:16,742 --> 01:01:19,375
Uta, you have to stop this

888
01:01:19,375 --> 01:01:21,347
Wait a minute, everybody.

889
01:01:21,347 --> 01:01:24,080
What happened to freedom

890
01:01:24,350 --> 01:01:28,785
To be free from disease and persecution is it all a lie

891
01:01:28,825 --> 01:01:31,187
Didn't you say you wanted to see a life where you didn't have to worry about pirates

892
01:01:32,388 --> 01:01:34,320
We said we wanted to go home

893
01:01:34,330 --> 01:01:35,761
What...

894
01:01:35,792 --> 01:01:38,795
Don't do this Uta is doing this for our own good

895
01:01:39,065 --> 01:01:40,566
I don't think it's funny anyway

896
01:01:40,636 --> 01:01:42,568
So am I. You guys shut up

897
01:01:42,568 --> 01:01:44,801
I agree with Uta. I don't like it here

898
01:01:45,071 --> 01:01:47,633
I want to go to school and this has nothing to do with it

899
01:01:47,673 --> 01:01:48,935
It does matter. It does matter

900
01:01:48,975 --> 01:01:50,807
You've gone too far, Uta

901
01:01:51,507 --> 01:01:53,579
That's too much. What? Why would she do that?

902
01:01:55,011 --> 01:01:57,383
I'm sorry, I see

903
01:01:57,543 --> 01:02:01,287
Just give you guys more fun stuff

904
01:02:09,395 --> 01:02:12,929
See, now everyone's in a better mood

905
01:02:20,837 --> 01:02:27,313
Let us live together in a new age of peace and freedom

906
01:02:30,416 --> 01:02:31,777
Charrose St

907
01:02:31,818 --> 01:02:35,351
We can't have any more victims and it's time to make a decision

908
01:02:35,621 --> 01:02:39,255
With or without the Draconians

909
01:02:48,204 --> 01:02:50,236
We all had a lucky escape

910
01:02:50,236 --> 01:02:51,838
Who are you?

911
01:02:51,838 --> 01:02:53,639
Bruno

912
01:02:53,639 --> 01:02:55,741
Kirby, have you seen Uta?

913
01:02:55,771 --> 01:02:56,602
This is...

914
01:02:56,642 --> 01:02:58,845
I see you didn't succeed in persuading her

915
01:02:58,845 --> 01:02:59,906
And you?

916
01:02:59,946 --> 01:03:00,706
See?

917
01:03:00,716 --> 01:03:02,248
Here we go.

918
01:03:02,378 --> 01:03:06,913
Wait a minute. I didn't hear about working with the Straw Hat Pirates. I'd rather die

919
01:03:06,983 --> 01:03:09,085
goodbye

920
01:03:09,055 --> 01:03:10,156
Wait a minute

921
01:03:10,456 --> 01:03:12,989
We will take Uta down in our own way

922
01:03:13,389 --> 01:03:14,861
A thousand SUNS...

923
01:03:14,861 --> 01:03:16,192
Where are my team members?

924
01:03:16,192 --> 01:03:17,794
They haven't come back yet

925
01:03:17,894 --> 01:03:21,427
We're not gonna win if they don't find Uta's weakness

926
01:03:21,667 --> 01:03:25,171
I can't use the power of the door in this body

927
01:03:25,401 --> 01:03:28,404
It's okay. They're gonna be fine

928
01:03:28,604 --> 01:03:32,138
Rotating powder star

929
01:03:32,148 --> 01:03:33,880
Is that okay?

930
01:03:34,110 --> 01:03:37,313
People are scared and people are confused

931
01:03:37,413 --> 01:03:41,287
Hide under Too Musica and run

932
01:03:41,387 --> 01:03:43,519
Soft strength enhancement I hit... To play... To play..

933
01:03:45,021 --> 01:03:46,192
Cold winds gather

934
01:03:52,328 --> 01:03:54,831
Demonic wind foot belly Strike

935
01:03:55,171 --> 01:03:57,433
One stroke of a knife and a horse ghost

936
01:04:01,878 --> 01:04:06,172
Soul ballads are frozen and lost

937
01:04:08,414 --> 01:04:11,547
Fish karate shark muscle palmar bottom

938
01:04:11,587 --> 01:04:15,421
The laser beam is a giant whitewater whirl

939
01:04:18,474 --> 01:04:19,255
It's going to collapse

940
01:04:19,255 --> 01:04:21,828
I don't know who blew this place up

941
01:04:22,228 --> 01:04:24,360
I'm so sorry

942
01:04:27,934 --> 01:04:31,467
We're about to get our asses kicked but I might look good buried alive

943
01:04:31,637 --> 01:04:32,969
Robin here

944
01:04:37,043 --> 01:04:41,447
Brieri I know you're in there Let's get into the looking-glass world

945
01:04:43,679 --> 01:04:45,051
Don't ignore me

946
01:04:45,051 --> 01:04:49,055
Without our message you would never have escaped the world of singing fruit

947
01:04:49,055 --> 01:04:52,688
You're never gonna see your family or your friends again Are you sure you want this?

948
01:04:54,130 --> 01:04:56,162
Shall I never see Brother Katakuli again?

949
01:04:56,162 --> 01:04:57,493
Yeah, yeah.

950
01:05:12,048 --> 01:05:12,939
You guys all right?

951
01:05:15,081 --> 01:05:15,111
luffy

952
01:05:15,181 --> 01:05:15,882
The regionalization

953
01:05:17,914 --> 01:05:18,284
What is this?

954
01:05:18,384 --> 01:05:22,048
This is the Thousand Yang so cute

955
01:05:22,118 --> 01:05:23,089
How is this transformed

956
01:05:24,290 --> 01:05:26,552
I didn't think I'd be back here

957
01:05:27,563 --> 01:05:29,595
I'm sorry, brother Owen.

958
01:05:29,725 --> 01:05:33,629
Robin did you find anything to beat Uta

959
01:05:34,170 --> 01:05:42,208
Based on previous records, there's no way around that

960
01:05:42,218 --> 01:05:43,209
what?

961
01:05:43,219 --> 01:05:48,754
But as long as the fruit users use Tol Musica we have a chance

962
01:05:48,955 --> 01:05:50,756
What is Too Musica?

963
01:05:50,756 --> 01:05:54,490
It contains the thoughts and feelings of people from the past

964
01:05:55,001 --> 01:06:00,006
All the loneliness and pain and any dark side of the heart it's sometimes called "the devil."

965
01:06:00,006 --> 01:06:02,368
Is it a weapon?

966
01:06:02,438 --> 01:06:06,342
What I've learned is that this is something you shouldn't touch

967
01:06:06,843 --> 01:06:12,318
So if we use that taboo against Uta what's our winning percentage

968
01:06:12,288 --> 01:06:15,922
According to previous records the Demon was awakened by Too Musica

969
01:06:15,922 --> 01:06:22,688
It doesn't just happen in the world of singing fruit it happens in the real world

970
01:06:22,698 --> 01:06:28,094
So the Demon Lord can connect the singing fruit world with the real world

971
01:06:28,104 --> 01:06:32,899
If the Demon Lord attacks in both worlds

972
01:06:32,909 --> 01:06:36,702
Then the world of singing fruits will disappear when the Demon Lord is defeated

973
01:06:36,712 --> 01:06:38,004
Really?

974
01:06:38,014 --> 01:06:43,109
It must have been done before that's why it's on record We should try it

975
01:06:47,954 --> 01:06:52,018
But will anyone attack Uta in the real world

976
01:06:54,330 --> 01:06:55,561
We are all in this singing fruit world

977
01:06:56,062 --> 01:06:59,065
If we're gonna attack Uta in the real world, it's gonna be the Navy

978
01:06:59,065 --> 01:06:59,765
No way

979
01:07:00,436 --> 01:07:03,129
As long as there are citizens

980
01:07:03,169 --> 01:07:06,702
They won't be able to do it

981
01:07:06,702 --> 01:07:07,773
There is one man who can

982
01:07:11,577 --> 01:07:12,738
The captain

983
01:07:13,679 --> 01:07:15,241
Is that paypal?

984
01:07:15,251 --> 01:07:17,113
And who the old man is

985
01:07:17,153 --> 01:07:20,186
He's the Gordon who raised Uta

986
01:07:20,386 --> 01:07:21,848
What uta's

987
01:07:21,958 --> 01:07:24,720
I tell you who you're talking about

988
01:07:24,720 --> 01:07:25,892
Shanks

989
01:07:26,923 --> 01:07:28,294
Shanks?

990
01:07:28,394 --> 01:07:32,899
If Shanks shows up he can stop the real world Uta

991
01:07:32,899 --> 01:07:35,231
Uncle, what happened to Shanks and Uta

992
01:07:35,371 --> 01:07:37,733
This is...

993
01:07:40,076 --> 01:07:41,467
uncle

994
01:07:44,981 --> 01:07:49,645
Too bad he's going after Uta and he can't beat her

995
01:07:49,685 --> 01:07:52,248
This is our captain and nothing can stop him

996
01:07:52,248 --> 01:07:55,952
There's no time for this anyway. Why don't we just get it over with

997
01:07:56,052 --> 01:07:57,453
But how

998
01:07:57,453 --> 01:08:02,158
Since both worlds are going to attack her at the same time we'll just keep attacking her

999
01:08:02,328 --> 01:08:06,833
Until the real world matches our attacks

1000
01:08:06,863 --> 01:08:13,769
I'm so scared it doesn't work but with the Straw Hat Pirates I know we're gonna win

1001
01:08:13,810 --> 01:08:15,471
We'll have to do it

1002
01:08:16,913 --> 01:08:19,405
Yeah, but then again,

1003
01:08:19,414 --> 01:08:21,647
What is this that you just figured out now

1004
01:08:37,834 --> 01:08:42,328
What are you doing here that you can't beat me no matter how many times we fight

1005
01:08:42,368 --> 01:08:44,330
It's not even a split yet

1006
01:08:45,471 --> 01:08:47,003
There you go again with the sore loser

1007
01:08:50,907 --> 01:08:54,841
It's like old times we decide who wins

1008
01:09:08,054 --> 01:09:13,900
ah

1009
01:09:17,773 --> 01:09:19,634
You're not serious at all

1010
01:09:24,510 --> 01:09:26,372
What you're doing right now is wrong

1011
01:09:26,382 --> 01:09:27,874
You're the one making the wrong choice

1012
01:09:28,955 --> 01:09:33,419
The era of the great sea pirate is over

1013
01:09:34,951 --> 01:09:37,623
Why do you want to be One Piece so bad

1014
01:09:37,924 --> 01:09:39,485
To create a new era

1015
01:09:40,596 --> 01:09:42,287
luffy

1016
01:09:48,364 --> 01:09:51,697
The era of the Great pirate began with the execution of Roger

1017
01:09:52,838 --> 01:09:56,672
And I'll end my flight because of you

1018
01:09:56,913 --> 01:09:59,075
Don't

1019
01:10:00,176 --> 01:10:00,867
uttar

1020
01:10:02,438 --> 01:10:03,269
you

1021
01:10:03,309 --> 01:10:08,544
Don't you love the Red-headed Pirates

1022
01:10:08,684 --> 01:10:15,391
Don't you love Shanks why do you hate pirates so much

1023
01:10:18,194 --> 01:10:18,925
It's all Shanks's fault

1024
01:10:20,797 --> 01:10:24,230
To me, Shanks is...

1025
01:10:24,700 --> 01:10:27,894
I really think of him as my real father

1026
01:10:35,041 --> 01:10:39,745
I thought everyone on that boat was my family

1027
01:10:39,745 --> 01:10:43,950
But it's all a lie to them

1028
01:10:44,620 --> 01:10:47,483
So Shanksy dumped me

1029
01:10:47,483 --> 01:10:51,117
He left me alone in Eligia

1030
01:10:51,557 --> 01:10:54,520
So you can be a good singer

1031
01:10:54,891 --> 01:10:56,262
It's not...

1032
01:11:04,270 --> 01:11:08,634
That's amazing. Your voice is the treasure of the world

1033
01:11:08,744 --> 01:11:14,440
There are a lot of professionals, instruments and sheet music

1034
01:11:14,610 --> 01:11:18,744
Please stay in Eligia and you are more than welcome in our kingdom

1035
01:11:21,257 --> 01:11:24,420
You look so happy and enjoying yourself when you sing here

1036
01:11:24,420 --> 01:11:25,822
Isn't it

1037
01:11:25,822 --> 01:11:31,597
Is it much more fun to sing in front of so many people than to sing to us

1038
01:11:31,597 --> 01:11:33,699
That's not true.

1039
01:11:33,970 --> 01:11:39,705
There is no peace or equality in this world

1040
01:11:39,735 --> 01:11:46,072
But your voice is the only one that makes everyone happy in this world

1041
01:11:46,082 --> 01:11:47,313
What are you talking about

1042
01:11:47,343 --> 01:11:50,046
I'm saying you can stay here

1043
01:11:50,046 --> 01:11:52,778
I'll be back for you when you're the best singer in the world

1044
01:11:52,889 --> 01:11:56,352
Fool, I'm the Goliath of the red-headed Sea

1045
01:11:56,422 --> 01:12:00,526
If studying music means I have to be apart from you and be apart from you

1046
01:12:00,556 --> 01:12:05,731
Yeah, I know. Let's get out of here tomorrow

1047
01:12:08,534 --> 01:12:09,836
But that night

1048
01:12:17,844 --> 01:12:18,704
Gordon

1049
01:12:20,917 --> 01:12:21,747
Are you awake

1050
01:12:24,780 --> 01:12:27,013
What's going on?

1051
01:12:27,283 --> 01:12:31,517
What about Shanks and them? Everything was stolen...

1052
01:12:31,958 --> 01:12:35,521
All of them were killed

1053
01:12:35,561 --> 01:12:37,223
Where is Shanks?

1054
01:12:37,293 --> 01:12:43,599
Their plan was to use your song to get close to Eligia and steal our treasure

1055
01:12:43,669 --> 01:12:44,931
You mean the red-headed sea pirate

1056
01:12:44,941 --> 01:12:47,934
That's them

1057
01:12:51,407 --> 01:12:57,583
You've been fooled by the red-headed pirate and Shanks

1058
01:13:04,520 --> 01:13:07,794
Shanks, don't leave me

1059
01:13:20,606 --> 01:13:24,210
Why?

1060
01:13:44,270 --> 01:13:47,233
Would Shanks do such a thing? You know the answer yourself

1061
01:13:47,273 --> 01:13:50,076
Then what have I been for 12 years

1062
01:13:50,176 --> 01:13:54,340
Luffy you're nothing more than a tool to Shanks

1063
01:13:54,380 --> 01:13:55,681
Shanks will be here

1064
01:13:55,751 --> 01:13:59,115
To save you? To save you

1065
01:13:59,255 --> 01:14:00,646
Save me? Why?

1066
01:14:01,557 --> 01:14:06,222
Because his daughter is doing this and Shanks is not gonna take it well

1067
01:14:11,497 --> 01:14:15,561
He abandoned me and he's never coming

1068
01:14:23,249 --> 01:14:26,352
Come on, Luffy.

1069
01:14:28,684 --> 01:14:29,255
goodbye

1070
01:14:39,735 --> 01:14:41,427
Shanks

1071
01:14:42,438 --> 01:14:44,600
Why?

1072
01:14:45,471 --> 01:14:48,674
I came to hear you sing

1073
01:14:48,674 --> 01:14:51,007
Long time no see

1074
01:15:07,493 --> 01:15:13,359
Just in time for my fans from all over the world to enter a new era

1075
01:15:13,529 --> 01:15:18,094
But before we go in, I want to finish with you

1076
01:15:20,306 --> 01:15:26,172
Everybody the worst of the pirates is here let's catch him together

1077
01:15:29,645 --> 01:15:32,078
Shanks is here, isn't he?

1078
01:15:32,278 --> 01:15:33,749
now

1079
01:15:49,635 --> 01:15:52,568
Do you still want to fight? So...

1080
01:15:55,401 --> 01:15:56,532
You're not singing.

1081
01:15:56,542 --> 01:15:58,104
The regionalization

1082
01:16:02,028 --> 01:16:04,981
Reinforcement of fur

1083
01:16:04,981 --> 01:16:06,943
transplant

1084
01:16:07,814 --> 01:16:10,746
Shroud ball sound

1085
01:16:12,588 --> 01:16:17,653
Uta, now your voice won't get through

1086
01:16:21,167 --> 01:16:22,698
Hello hello

1087
01:16:34,410 --> 01:16:37,713
Hold the cloth even if it puts your life in danger

1088
01:16:42,688 --> 01:16:44,851
Don't

1089
01:16:48,554 --> 01:16:51,727
You have to hang in there a new era is upon us

1090
01:16:58,504 --> 01:17:04,270
Yes we will use all the power of the navy to stop Uta

1091
01:17:04,270 --> 01:17:06,742
It doesn't matter if the audience gets caught in the crossfire

1092
01:17:06,772 --> 01:17:10,776
We have to sacrifice them to reduce the number of victims and protect the world

1093
01:17:11,347 --> 01:17:12,708
Destroy her

1094
01:17:12,718 --> 01:17:16,282
The Navy says it's on the right side but do they really want to kill civilians

1095
01:17:16,382 --> 01:17:17,653
Answer me yellow Ape

1096
01:17:17,653 --> 01:17:22,058
There is no justice without the victim

1097
01:17:22,058 --> 01:17:28,124
How cruel to sacrifice millions of people to stop a child

1098
01:17:29,495 --> 01:17:32,398
Eight feet Qiongyu

1099
01:17:43,880 --> 01:17:47,914
I'm sorry we're dealing with a domestic dispute

1100
01:17:49,085 --> 01:17:52,688
Would you stay out of it?

1101
01:17:55,862 --> 01:18:01,327
No we have the world on our shoulders

1102
01:18:02,728 --> 01:18:05,832
And even if it is, just stay out of it

1103
01:18:07,804 --> 01:18:12,809
If I could do that I would be able to see with this eye

1104
01:18:16,742 --> 01:18:18,474
North Township...

1105
01:18:19,285 --> 01:18:23,649
Looks like something big is happening in the real world

1106
01:18:27,723 --> 01:18:30,356
Sure enough, it was a wakeful mushroom

1107
01:18:30,426 --> 01:18:37,463
If you eat that mushroom it doesn't just wake you up it makes you go crazy and lose control of your emotions

1108
01:18:48,544 --> 01:18:53,309
I should have gone after you bad guys first

1109
01:18:55,481 --> 01:18:57,053
uttar

1110
01:19:00,426 --> 01:19:05,962
I just don't have the guts I don't have the guts to do that

1111
01:19:06,092 --> 01:19:09,165
But I won't hesitate now

1112
01:19:11,467 --> 01:19:13,099
Watch out that thing should be coming out

1113
01:19:17,243 --> 01:19:18,634
I... My perfect shield

1114
01:19:23,549 --> 01:19:24,680
That's...

1115
01:19:24,680 --> 01:19:32,248
Oh, that's a problem. We've got this specially prepared so I don't think we'll need it

1116
01:19:37,563 --> 01:19:40,596
How did that happen? She woke it up

1117
01:19:40,626 --> 01:19:43,860
When the singing fruit user sings that song, it wakes up

1118
01:19:44,030 --> 01:19:45,661
The old devil

1119
01:19:47,173 --> 01:19:49,135
That's Tot Musica

1120
01:19:49,836 --> 01:19:53,910
"With a wandering heart the clouds begin to cover the sky."

1121
01:19:53,970 --> 01:19:56,712
"The rain and my bitter tears began to fall."

1122
01:19:56,742 --> 01:19:59,916
"They have been the next stop Let I began to read a spell"

1123
01:20:00,286 --> 01:20:03,880
"Be my salvation."

1124
01:20:04,020 --> 01:20:10,686
"Let me begin to spell my salvation."

1125
01:20:10,887 --> 01:20:17,763
"These ancient lyrics are like hymns to which death cannot escape."

1126
01:20:17,763 --> 01:20:25,571
"I pray how to erase this confusion and I pray for peace from the future sea."

1127
01:20:25,671 --> 01:20:33,019
"It's time for redemption."

1128
01:20:33,109 --> 01:20:36,883
"I feel this anger making me stronger."

1129
01:20:36,883 --> 01:20:40,957
"These cries have echoed for so long now all I can do is scream."

1130
01:20:41,027 --> 01:20:44,290
"I know you feel new too so keep singing this song with me."

1131
01:20:44,330 --> 01:20:48,124
"We'll keep singing this song even if they torture you."

1132
01:20:48,134 --> 01:20:53,139
"When we sing this song together we'll start another big bang."

1133
01:20:53,189 --> 01:20:54,931
I can't block out that sound

1134
01:20:55,131 --> 01:20:58,174
No, it's no use

1135
01:20:58,174 --> 01:21:02,608
The Demon Lord has connected the real world with the singing fruit world

1136
01:21:09,155 --> 01:21:11,117
Uta Uta enough

1137
01:21:11,287 --> 01:21:13,119
Uta, can you hear us?

1138
01:21:13,119 --> 01:21:15,491
The world feels strange

1139
01:21:15,822 --> 01:21:17,253
uttar

1140
01:21:33,940 --> 01:21:37,673
uttar

1141
01:22:13,019 --> 01:22:16,752
Hot air fist

1142
01:22:34,670 --> 01:22:39,235
Damn it looks like we're really gonna hit Uta at the same time

1143
01:22:39,305 --> 01:22:45,311
Princess Uta you were trying to save everyone with your song Why is this happening

1144
01:22:46,582 --> 01:22:48,184
Lying cloth

1145
01:22:48,184 --> 01:22:50,286
I'm fine.

1146
01:22:50,326 --> 01:22:52,849
Leave Tot Musica to us

1147
01:22:52,889 --> 01:22:53,689
so

1148
01:22:53,759 --> 01:22:56,192
Don't leave Uta alone

1149
01:22:56,292 --> 01:22:58,124
Give her a good beating

1150
01:23:06,532 --> 01:23:10,136
Hey, can you hear me, Uta? This...

1151
01:23:11,077 --> 01:23:12,168
Luffy Senior

1152
01:23:16,883 --> 01:23:17,473
luffy

1153
01:23:17,513 --> 01:23:19,045
What are you doing to fight back

1154
01:23:19,135 --> 01:23:21,848
Uta, listen to me

1155
01:23:25,792 --> 01:23:27,383
Uta, listen to me

1156
01:23:27,423 --> 01:23:31,397
I have nothing to say to the pirate

1157
01:23:36,502 --> 01:23:38,594
- Uncle. - paypal

1158
01:23:38,664 --> 01:23:45,771
I can't let you continue to hurt the friend you cherish so much....

1159
01:23:45,912 --> 01:23:48,344
He's the one who believes in Shanks, you know

1160
01:23:48,374 --> 01:23:51,808
No, Uta that was a lie

1161
01:23:51,818 --> 01:23:58,714
It wasn't the Red-headed Pirates who took out Eligia 12 years ago

1162
01:24:00,446 --> 01:24:03,219
It's Tot Musica

1163
01:24:04,390 --> 01:24:09,025
I'm sorry I haven't been able to tell you the truth...

1164
01:24:09,595 --> 01:24:13,900
Do you remember the party that day?

1165
01:24:14,000 --> 01:24:18,434
The ones who heard about the conservatory you're leaving with Shanks

1166
01:24:18,504 --> 01:24:21,938
Take advantage of this last chance to hear you sing song after song

1167
01:24:21,958 --> 01:24:29,485
Because it's such a special opportunity we've invited the entire nation to hear you sing

1168
01:24:29,485 --> 01:24:31,888
That's probably where it went wrong

1169
01:24:33,559 --> 01:24:40,196
Your voice summoned the music that was sealed beneath the castle

1170
01:24:45,401 --> 01:24:53,840
That sheet music was the Tot Muscia and before we knew it it was in front of you and started it all

1171
01:24:53,840 --> 01:24:58,414
It has used the fruit of your song for its freedom

1172
01:25:04,490 --> 01:25:06,782
The devil who unsealed the music

1173
01:25:06,853 --> 01:25:12,488
Take your little body and start using your powers on the people of this kingdom

1174
01:25:16,662 --> 01:25:20,867
Get up Uta don't let it control you

1175
01:25:34,580 --> 01:25:36,182
Don't

1176
01:25:36,182 --> 01:25:42,218
It's a good thing you were young and you started to get tired and pass out

1177
01:25:42,268 --> 01:25:45,822
But that kingdom...

1178
01:25:53,569 --> 01:25:55,932
Is the navy here yet

1179
01:25:55,942 --> 01:25:58,634
I was wondering if you could keep this from Uta

1180
01:25:58,704 --> 01:26:01,577
It would be cruel for her to know the truth

1181
01:26:01,707 --> 01:26:05,541
Okay, I'll tell the Navy this is my fault

1182
01:26:05,611 --> 01:26:16,052
It's not our fault Shanks and the red-headed pirate did it all you tell Uta that

1183
01:26:16,092 --> 01:26:18,694
Are you going to leave her here?

1184
01:26:18,694 --> 01:26:26,602
She has the best voice but we're being chased by the Navy all day and that's gonna limit her talent

1185
01:26:26,602 --> 01:26:31,107
You have the ability to turn her into an amazing singer

1186
01:26:31,137 --> 01:26:34,040
None of this is the fault of her singing

1187
01:26:34,040 --> 01:26:35,741
Shanks...

1188
01:26:36,742 --> 01:26:44,650
Okay, I... The King of Gorden Eligia swears to you on behalf of all my music-loving people

1189
01:26:44,680 --> 01:26:51,287
I'm gonna raise Uta to be an amazing singer who can bring joy to the world

1190
01:26:52,458 --> 01:26:58,734
Uta Even when we're apart you'll always be my daughter

1191
01:26:58,764 --> 01:27:02,398
So let's laugh and go

1192
01:27:02,408 --> 01:27:06,672
This is the beginning of our unique little singer's career

1193
01:27:10,546 --> 01:27:11,677
Uta, did you hear that?

1194
01:27:12,518 --> 01:27:14,811
Sure enough Shanks really...

1195
01:27:33,239 --> 01:27:36,472
That's the design I drew

1196
01:27:41,207 --> 01:27:42,939
I've drawn it

1197
01:27:43,049 --> 01:27:45,611
See what is this?

1198
01:27:45,711 --> 01:27:47,613
It's Shanks's straw hat

1199
01:27:48,214 --> 01:27:51,017
- Is this a hat? - Yes

1200
01:27:52,919 --> 01:27:53,449
You're a terrible painter

1201
01:27:53,619 --> 01:27:56,152
Let's take this pattern as a sign of the new age

1202
01:27:56,192 --> 01:27:58,094
Here it is. You can keep it

1203
01:28:01,968 --> 01:28:04,000
Stop it Uta

1204
01:28:04,170 --> 01:28:06,973
This is not freedom

1205
01:28:07,633 --> 01:28:10,136
This is not a new era

1206
01:28:11,277 --> 01:28:15,071
You know better than anyone without results

1207
01:28:17,213 --> 01:28:20,676
luffy

1208
01:28:21,247 --> 01:28:22,118
It's too late

1209
01:28:29,295 --> 01:28:32,358
What the hell is this....?

1210
01:28:35,161 --> 01:28:37,934
Everybody get in here and hide

1211
01:28:37,994 --> 01:28:40,937
Hey, how are we gonna fight this thing?

1212
01:28:40,937 --> 01:28:44,200
Would it be nice to know when our attacks became consistent

1213
01:28:57,583 --> 01:29:06,562
The strange navy is trying to kill the citizens but the pirates are protecting them

1214
01:29:06,592 --> 01:29:09,565
These titles mean nothing

1215
01:29:09,836 --> 01:29:11,968
Why protect them?

1216
01:29:12,168 --> 01:29:15,932
Let's not add another sin to our daughter's grief

1217
01:29:17,173 --> 01:29:20,937
Guys I don't want to see any bodies

1218
01:29:22,608 --> 01:29:27,784
Looks like we have to stop the Devil first

1219
01:29:29,786 --> 01:29:32,688
Uta ate the wakeful mushroom

1220
01:29:32,688 --> 01:29:35,992
She has become one with Tot Musica and the only way we can beat her is....

1221
01:29:38,064 --> 01:29:39,495
Uta, it's you

1222
01:29:39,495 --> 01:29:40,656
It's all your fault

1223
01:29:40,897 --> 01:29:42,328
You are the one who caused your SINS

1224
01:29:42,328 --> 01:29:45,161
Shut up. I know all about it

1225
01:29:46,172 --> 01:29:51,737
About a year after I was able to deliver my music to everyone

1226
01:29:51,737 --> 01:29:56,112
I picked up a phone bug that had captured a reflection of that day

1227
01:29:57,113 --> 01:30:02,118
Anyone who sees this watch out for that little girl Uta she's dangerous

1228
01:30:02,218 --> 01:30:04,851
Her voice will destroy the world

1229
01:30:04,851 --> 01:30:10,887
So what can I do that so many people around the world still want to hear my music

1230
01:30:10,997 --> 01:30:14,260
Uta I want to get away from here

1231
01:30:14,310 --> 01:30:18,664
Do you think there's a world where I can listen to you forever?

1232
01:30:18,724 --> 01:30:22,098
Yeah, Uta, who hates pirates the most

1233
01:30:22,108 --> 01:30:24,740
This is all for everyone who found me

1234
01:30:24,911 --> 01:30:27,413
I can't go back

1235
01:30:27,513 --> 01:30:29,205
For the New era

1236
01:30:31,247 --> 01:30:34,550
Hot goat

1237
01:30:38,284 --> 01:30:41,387
Brother Owen, be careful.

1238
01:30:44,330 --> 01:30:48,014
How could I let a lady get hurt?

1239
01:30:48,064 --> 01:30:51,597
And there are some things that only you can do

1240
01:30:51,737 --> 01:30:53,329
good

1241
01:30:54,570 --> 01:30:56,432
Kirby will take the lead

1242
01:30:57,473 --> 01:31:01,137
The main objective of the good guard formation is to protect the spectators

1243
01:31:01,247 --> 01:31:04,340
Namie Robin helped open an escape route

1244
01:31:04,350 --> 01:31:07,884
Everybody stay calm and get in that mirror

1245
01:31:08,054 --> 01:31:12,218
Bruno and the others protect them

1246
01:31:12,288 --> 01:31:14,190
Frankie and Voo-ping, you'll be flanking

1247
01:31:14,260 --> 01:31:17,954
Jabbar protects Luffy and Gordon

1248
01:31:17,994 --> 01:31:20,456
Shilumebo and I will play flanker

1249
01:31:20,466 --> 01:31:26,803
Lie Boo, you'll provide fire support in the back and Brooke and Sanchi you're the top defense at the defense center

1250
01:31:26,803 --> 01:31:32,008
The advanced attackers in the attack center are Sauron and Owen and I'm handing you over to RON

1251
01:31:32,038 --> 01:31:35,511
And then what? Let's get started

1252
01:31:37,583 --> 01:31:41,878
The French bazooka

1253
01:31:50,526 --> 01:31:53,329
Zeus flew with the wind

1254
01:31:59,836 --> 01:32:02,668
Uta, I'm sorry.

1255
01:32:02,668 --> 01:32:07,043
I was wrong to be afraid that your powers would stop you from performing in front of everyone

1256
01:32:07,313 --> 01:32:15,151
And as a person who loves music, I can't give up Tot Musica

1257
01:32:16,322 --> 01:32:24,320
I'm a fool and I'm a coward who's always looking for a reason to run away and I deserve it

1258
01:32:24,330 --> 01:32:29,065
My dad always left me alone, too

1259
01:32:29,365 --> 01:32:33,369
But you've always been there for Princess Uta

1260
01:32:33,639 --> 01:32:36,232
You lost the kingdom and you still kept your word

1261
01:32:36,342 --> 01:32:38,234
You're actually pretty good

1262
01:32:42,608 --> 01:32:43,910
Okay, I'm out of here

1263
01:32:44,150 --> 01:32:44,710
luffy

1264
01:32:45,481 --> 01:32:52,748
Luffy her singing can bring joy to all people in this world

1265
01:32:53,089 --> 01:32:55,121
But this one

1266
01:32:55,281 --> 01:33:01,657
I really feel sorry for her please Luffy go save her

1267
01:33:03,339 --> 01:33:05,141
Of course I would have saved her

1268
01:33:08,084 --> 01:33:09,175
Luffy let him go

1269
01:33:10,746 --> 01:33:14,720
We're running out of time and we're not gonna get back to the real world if this doesn't work out

1270
01:33:45,321 --> 01:33:46,813
Red hair

1271
01:33:46,823 --> 01:33:48,614
We must attack at the same time

1272
01:33:48,815 --> 01:33:54,220
We must attack the same place at the same time as the world of singing fruit

1273
01:33:55,761 --> 01:33:57,323
Why?

1274
01:33:57,493 --> 01:33:58,654
BIG MOM's son will be here

1275
01:33:58,724 --> 01:34:02,628
I'm here to save my sister

1276
01:34:08,975 --> 01:34:14,410
I used my eyes to see a little bit about my sister's situation

1277
01:34:14,450 --> 01:34:17,283
Both of us must...

1278
01:34:17,313 --> 01:34:18,785
I know

1279
01:34:19,355 --> 01:34:21,788
You're not the only one with new ideas here

1280
01:34:21,788 --> 01:34:25,621
But he's not ready. He's not calm

1281
01:34:25,621 --> 01:34:28,895
But Katakuli I'm glad you're here

1282
01:34:28,895 --> 01:34:32,398
We've got our hands full here with the Navy...

1283
01:34:34,670 --> 01:34:38,104
I want you to be a good boy

1284
01:34:49,595 --> 01:34:50,987
luffy

1285
01:34:50,997 --> 01:34:52,188
Shanks

1286
01:34:52,298 --> 01:34:53,089
It worked

1287
01:34:53,129 --> 01:34:55,661
It's connected to the real world

1288
01:35:04,110 --> 01:35:07,073
You son of a bitch.

1289
01:35:07,173 --> 01:35:12,819
Three streams of fire cut six tsuji

1290
01:35:13,880 --> 01:35:15,211
Will it ever end?

1291
01:35:15,311 --> 01:35:20,156
You'll regret stepping on you, you wicked swordsman

1292
01:35:21,227 --> 01:35:23,419
Didn't I say there was no time?

1293
01:35:23,529 --> 01:35:24,290
damn

1294
01:35:26,162 --> 01:35:30,296
If only we could get rid of those hands and feet

1295
01:35:30,396 --> 01:35:36,072
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no

1296
01:35:39,976 --> 01:35:44,540
Dad, you finally found your stupid son

1297
01:35:50,086 --> 01:35:52,688
I saw what I saw my dad see

1298
01:35:53,419 --> 01:35:54,821
luffy

1299
01:35:55,161 --> 01:35:57,693
All right, come on guys

1300
01:35:57,924 --> 01:35:59,796
Do your best on the ground

1301
01:35:59,926 --> 01:36:01,357
good

1302
01:36:01,928 --> 01:36:06,162
All right, let's do our best on the floor

1303
01:36:06,332 --> 01:36:08,234
good

1304
01:36:11,607 --> 01:36:14,370
We need to stop Tot Musica's hands and feet

1305
01:36:14,380 --> 01:36:17,113
Follow my instructions and hit your right foot first

1306
01:36:17,243 --> 01:36:19,115
The right foot

1307
01:36:34,060 --> 01:36:37,333
The left hand

1308
01:36:49,976 --> 01:36:51,377
- Left foot. Left foot.

1309
01:36:51,377 --> 01:36:52,578
All right

1310
01:36:52,799 --> 01:36:55,681
Let me give you a hand

1311
01:37:04,060 --> 01:37:06,893
Center right center right

1312
01:37:13,099 --> 01:37:15,932
Center left center left

1313
01:37:23,449 --> 01:37:26,542
Jesus, your father and your son are very close

1314
01:37:26,552 --> 01:37:27,844
The right hand

1315
01:37:28,154 --> 01:37:28,644
o

1316
01:37:34,490 --> 01:37:38,955
Fledge Fireball

1317
01:37:48,905 --> 01:37:49,836
luffy

1318
01:37:49,876 --> 01:37:50,706
Shanks

1319
01:37:50,766 --> 01:37:52,839
Now now

1320
01:38:59,645 --> 01:39:02,939
Did you see it? Because we went to war

1321
01:39:03,039 --> 01:39:03,739
So much love

1322
01:39:03,850 --> 01:39:05,741
We have good food these days

1323
01:39:05,812 --> 01:39:10,887
Treasure treasure

1324
01:39:16,162 --> 01:39:18,224
How did you get in here?

1325
01:39:18,224 --> 01:39:21,958
Maybe it was the pirates who took her

1326
01:39:23,199 --> 01:39:25,231
You've got to be kidding

1327
01:39:25,231 --> 01:39:29,305
All right, all right, stop crying

1328
01:39:29,305 --> 01:39:35,271
Go to sleep, baby quietly

1329
01:39:43,419 --> 01:39:46,652
Is this some kind of fate

1330
01:40:29,495 --> 01:40:33,099
Are you lonely, too

1331
01:40:39,155 --> 01:40:41,788
Shanks, I...

1332
01:40:41,848 --> 01:40:44,250
It's okay. It's over

1333
01:40:47,393 --> 01:40:50,857
If you take this medicine now and go to sleep, you'll be fine

1334
01:40:50,967 --> 01:40:54,961
Shanks... I don't want to see you...

1335
01:40:55,131 --> 01:40:57,403
But...

1336
01:40:57,403 --> 01:40:58,604
I'm dying to see you again

1337
01:40:58,634 --> 01:41:02,138
Stop talking and drink

1338
01:41:04,240 --> 01:41:05,711
What's going on?

1339
01:41:05,812 --> 01:41:10,576
I thought we defeated the Devil...

1340
01:41:11,717 --> 01:41:16,983
Don't... Stop it.

1341
01:41:16,993 --> 01:41:18,554
Stop it.

1342
01:41:18,694 --> 01:41:21,557
Why can't we go back Why?

1343
01:41:21,557 --> 01:41:23,559
It's too late.

1344
01:41:23,559 --> 01:41:29,095
Tot Musica's powers have taken our souls

1345
01:41:29,105 --> 01:41:30,436
Really!?

1346
01:41:31,707 --> 01:41:34,240
Uta drank the medicine quickly

1347
01:41:39,175 --> 01:41:43,549
I have to sing and I have to bring everyone back

1348
01:41:45,882 --> 01:41:49,755
Shanks... I thought you said that a long time ago

1349
01:41:50,056 --> 01:41:55,721
Do my songs have the power to make people happy?

1350
01:42:07,303 --> 01:42:13,609
I'm Gojiuta from the Red-headed One Pirates

1351
01:42:50,456 --> 01:42:59,836
"I think of us playing by the sea."

1352
01:42:59,966 --> 01:43:04,140
"Just you and me."

1353
01:43:04,170 --> 01:43:13,549
"But the smell of the sea is fading away."

1354
01:43:13,609 --> 01:43:17,123
"Slowly slipping away."

1355
01:43:17,183 --> 01:43:23,960
"So I sang a familiar song," "I hope you can hear it."

1356
01:43:24,090 --> 01:43:31,167
"I'll sing till you come back to me."

1357
01:43:31,227 --> 01:43:38,134
"I wanna believe, I wanna try to believe."

1358
01:43:38,174 --> 01:43:45,181
"On the far side of the sea or among the stars."

1359
01:43:45,241 --> 01:43:50,746
"I need you to hear me and I need you to believe me."

1360
01:43:50,787 --> 01:43:54,150
"A gust of wind blows my wings."

1361
01:43:54,170 --> 01:43:57,593
"Kept calling to me."

1362
01:43:57,693 --> 01:44:07,173
"Fly me to the sky."

1363
01:44:09,575 --> 01:44:12,909
The voice of an angel

1364
01:44:12,909 --> 01:44:13,870
uttar

1365
01:44:13,880 --> 01:44:19,976
"I wanna believe, I wanna try to believe."

1366
01:44:20,046 --> 01:44:27,123
"On the far side of the sea or among the stars."

1367
01:44:27,173 --> 01:44:32,558
"I need you to hear me and I need you to believe me."

1368
01:44:32,588 --> 01:44:38,564
"We'll meet again one day and continue in this dream."

1369
01:44:38,564 --> 01:44:48,975
"And then in the sunset we'll wake up again."

1370
01:45:18,174 --> 01:45:22,338
Hey, why didn't you punch me?

1371
01:45:22,348 --> 01:45:25,942
My fists are stronger than guns. Didn't I tell you

1372
01:45:25,982 --> 01:45:29,515
I thought you used to hit me with your little punches

1373
01:45:29,515 --> 01:45:31,788
I wasn't at full strength

1374
01:45:31,858 --> 01:45:35,551
There you go again with the sore loser

1375
01:45:38,484 --> 01:45:42,498
Since when are you taller than me?

1376
01:45:54,340 --> 01:45:57,643
This hat means a lot to me, too

1377
01:45:59,315 --> 01:46:03,950
You're gonna be the man to match that hat one day

1378
01:46:12,829 --> 01:46:15,761
Shanks Luffy

1379
01:46:15,761 --> 01:46:17,363
He's back.

1380
01:46:17,363 --> 01:46:19,695
The entire audience is safe

1381
01:46:23,109 --> 01:46:24,400
That's good

1382
01:46:26,172 --> 01:46:32,778
I'm sorry I didn't trust Shanks and the whole red-headed crew

1383
01:46:34,020 --> 01:46:39,355
Thank you! for saving my life

1384
01:46:43,089 --> 01:46:51,828
All right, it's time to hand over Uta to the super-criminal who wants to destroy the world

1385
01:46:53,439 --> 01:46:56,202
you

1386
01:46:56,242 --> 01:47:00,436
Are you fighting back?

1387
01:47:00,446 --> 01:47:02,708
With all of you

1388
01:47:02,879 --> 01:47:06,612
She... It's my daughter

1389
01:47:07,513 --> 01:47:11,047
She's a very important part of our family

1390
01:47:11,157 --> 01:47:14,190
If you're gonna take her away from me

1391
01:47:14,390 --> 01:47:16,292
You better prepare to die

1392
01:47:23,599 --> 01:47:30,706
You subjugates the entire population under the Vice admiral and that is the power of Shanks, one of the Four Kings

1393
01:47:31,337 --> 01:47:38,975
Forget it. We shouldn't be fighting here too close to the citizens

1394
01:47:58,104 --> 01:48:00,696
Are my fans okay? I hope they're not too upset

1395
01:48:00,807 --> 01:48:05,201
It's okay. Humans aren't that weak

1396
01:48:05,211 --> 01:48:09,175
And a new era is upon us

1397
01:48:15,862 --> 01:48:24,230
"Where is this wind coming from and where is it taking us?"

1398
01:48:24,270 --> 01:48:31,577
"I looked to the sky for answers but it didn't answer me."

1399
01:48:31,607 --> 01:48:35,741
"This song that I sing"

1400
01:48:35,781 --> 01:48:40,546
"Where is it going to go?"

1401
01:48:40,586 --> 01:48:48,524
"I try to find the answer inside."

1402
01:48:49,565 --> 01:48:55,731
"We are once again heading into the unknown sea."

1403
01:48:55,761 --> 01:49:00,106
"Go forth bravely."

1404
01:49:02,738 --> 01:49:08,915
"I have but one wish."

1405
01:49:08,975 --> 01:49:15,922
"Don't give up and keep going."

1406
01:49:16,022 --> 01:49:26,963
"Let all the ships in my heart raise their sails and let me hear the call of the sea."

1407
01:49:26,993 --> 01:49:33,269
"I have to keep singing."

1408
01:49:36,772 --> 01:49:38,774
Did you sleep well?

1409
01:49:39,445 --> 01:49:41,577
Where are Uta and Shanks

1410
01:54:38,664 --> 01:54:41,467
To the thousand Yang... The regionalization
