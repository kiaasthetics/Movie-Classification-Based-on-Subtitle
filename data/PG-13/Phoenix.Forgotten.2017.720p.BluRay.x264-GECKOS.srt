1
00:00:24,733 --> 00:00:27,020
I've just been advised
by our group that we are deploying

2
00:00:27,110 --> 00:00:29,773
six members of law enforcement
and two canine dogs to aid...

3
00:00:29,863 --> 00:00:31,980
Another day of searching
in the desert for clues

4
00:00:32,074 --> 00:00:33,690
in the case of three missing teens.

5
00:00:33,784 --> 00:00:35,696
Multiple law enforcement agencies are here.

6
00:00:35,786 --> 00:00:39,111
Well, there's still volunteers continuing
the search, the satellite images...

7
00:00:39,206 --> 00:00:40,913
So anyone with any information at all...

8
00:00:40,999 --> 00:00:42,740
...doubled since yesterday.

9
00:00:42,834 --> 00:00:45,918
As more time goes on,
they're really pushing their resources

10
00:00:46,004 --> 00:00:47,836
to make sure these teenagers are found.

11
00:01:00,102 --> 00:01:02,389
You know, I read an article,

12
00:01:02,479 --> 00:01:06,392
you wouldn't believe the living
you can make photographing food.

13
00:01:08,527 --> 00:01:10,814
Hey, Dad, what's the secret
to making a great burger?

14
00:01:10,904 --> 00:01:13,612
Well, the first thing you got to do
is you got to get your coals hot.

15
00:01:14,825 --> 00:01:18,159
Super hot, so when you put it on there,
it seals in the juices.

16
00:01:18,245 --> 00:01:20,828
Then you don't flip it but one time.

17
00:01:22,749 --> 00:01:24,081
That's the secret.

18
00:01:24,167 --> 00:01:29,333
# Happy birthday, dear Sophie #

19
00:01:29,423 --> 00:01:34,635
# Happy birthday to you #

20
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:36,712
- Make a wish, sweetie. Make a good one.
- And many more.

21
00:01:38,265 --> 00:01:39,801
Okay, keep going.

22
00:01:39,891 --> 00:01:42,224
- Keep going, one more! You did it!
- Go, go, go!

23
00:01:46,023 --> 00:01:48,015
Come on. Sit down.

24
00:01:48,108 --> 00:01:50,942
Imagine that you were going
to talk to grown-up Sophie.

25
00:01:51,028 --> 00:01:52,860
What would you say to yourself?

26
00:01:52,946 --> 00:01:54,778
- I don't know.
- You don't know?

27
00:01:56,908 --> 00:01:59,366
Can you give Sophie
some advice for the future?

28
00:01:59,453 --> 00:02:03,163
Sophie, when you get older,
you must obey your husband.

29
00:02:03,248 --> 00:02:04,614
- You must obey him.
- Gramps!

30
00:02:04,708 --> 00:02:05,994
- What, to Soph?
- Yeah.

31
00:02:06,084 --> 00:02:07,200
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

32
00:02:07,294 --> 00:02:08,535
You want to do it right now?

33
00:02:08,629 --> 00:02:11,042
Happy birthday, honey. I love you.

34
00:02:12,549 --> 00:02:15,257
I love you, Sophie. You're the best.

35
00:02:15,344 --> 00:02:18,087
Your brother is crazy, but I love him too.

36
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:20,718
And now he's going to talk to you,
so give me... give me the camera.

37
00:02:20,807 --> 00:02:23,174
- No, no, no, I'm the director.
- No, honey, I want the camera now.

38
00:02:23,268 --> 00:02:27,228
No, it's your turn.
Sit down next to your sister. Come on.

39
00:02:27,314 --> 00:02:28,600
- Now you know how I feel.
- Okay.

40
00:02:28,690 --> 00:02:32,149
All right. I want you to, uh, say
something very sweet to your sister.

41
00:02:32,235 --> 00:02:35,103
A nice wish for her sixth year of life. Go.

42
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:40,404
This is how
I remember my brother. How I try to.

43
00:02:41,328 --> 00:02:43,411
Sitting next to me
at my sixth birthday party.

44
00:02:44,581 --> 00:02:46,914
Before anyone knew
our lives were about to change.

45
00:02:47,876 --> 00:02:50,289
That this would be
the last time we were all together.

46
00:03:22,494 --> 00:03:25,237
- Hey.
- Oh, hey. Hey.

47
00:03:25,330 --> 00:03:27,322
- It's so good to see you.
- Good to see you.

48
00:03:28,625 --> 00:03:30,617
- How was your flight?
- Uh, good. This is Jay.

49
00:03:31,169 --> 00:03:32,159
Jay, this is my dad, Steve.

50
00:03:32,254 --> 00:03:33,711
How are you, Steve? Nice to meet you.

51
00:03:35,090 --> 00:03:36,501
What did you pack, Jay?

52
00:03:39,386 --> 00:03:41,469
Are you going to be filming the whole time?

53
00:03:42,097 --> 00:03:43,838
Yeah, that's, uh... that's the idea.

54
00:03:44,891 --> 00:03:46,553
You're like Harrison Ford.

55
00:03:47,185 --> 00:03:49,427
Okay, I'm over here in the scam lot.

56
00:03:49,521 --> 00:03:52,059
That's what they do, they scam you.
They've got the public one

57
00:03:52,149 --> 00:03:54,812
that's so far over,
it might as well be in another county.

58
00:03:55,569 --> 00:03:57,686
You go there,
you're going to miss your flight.

59
00:03:58,113 --> 00:03:59,103
And, uh...

60
00:04:01,074 --> 00:04:03,031
they resell the flight and then...

61
00:04:04,119 --> 00:04:06,202
you're shit out of luck is what you are.

62
00:04:13,378 --> 00:04:15,961
So you've got your own little reality show?

63
00:04:16,047 --> 00:04:17,333
It's not a reality show, dad.

64
00:04:17,424 --> 00:04:19,791
- It's a documentary.
- Documentary, huh?

65
00:04:19,885 --> 00:04:21,217
- Uh-huh.
- Okay.

66
00:04:22,262 --> 00:04:23,753
What's your documentary about?

67
00:04:26,808 --> 00:04:28,515
It's about Josh.

68
00:04:31,438 --> 00:04:32,428
Josh?

69
00:04:40,447 --> 00:04:42,564
Anyone with any information at all,

70
00:04:42,657 --> 00:04:44,740
we're asking you
to please call a special tip line.

71
00:04:44,826 --> 00:04:47,660
...searching in the desert for
clues in the case of three missing teens.

72
00:04:47,746 --> 00:04:49,863
Search efforts have doubled since yesterday.

73
00:04:49,956 --> 00:04:52,573
As more time goes on,
they're really pushing their resources

74
00:04:52,667 --> 00:04:54,875
to make sure these teenagers are found.

75
00:04:54,961 --> 00:04:57,544
We will continue to return here until we've

76
00:04:57,631 --> 00:04:59,839
completely exhausted everything
that we think we need to do.

77
00:04:59,925 --> 00:05:02,258
There are still volunteers
continuing the search,

78
00:05:02,344 --> 00:05:04,802
uh, and satellite imaging is ongoing.

79
00:05:04,888 --> 00:05:07,175
Arizona State Police
are now in their third week

80
00:05:07,265 --> 00:05:08,881
searching for missing teenagers

81
00:05:08,975 --> 00:05:12,184
Ashley Foster, Mark Abrams, and Josh Bishop.

82
00:05:18,985 --> 00:05:21,147
Well... sold.

83
00:05:21,238 --> 00:05:22,570
Yeah.

84
00:05:32,415 --> 00:05:33,826
You don't want to come in?

85
00:05:35,126 --> 00:05:37,038
I... No, I-I better not.

86
00:05:37,128 --> 00:05:40,212
- Just, uh, say hi to mom for me.
- Okay.

87
00:05:40,298 --> 00:05:41,664
- Okay?
- Yeah.

88
00:05:41,758 --> 00:05:43,545
- I'll talk to you later.
- Okay. Bye.

89
00:05:52,352 --> 00:05:55,186
Well, I like your bangs.

90
00:05:55,272 --> 00:05:57,184
- You're so cute!
- Mom!

91
00:05:58,358 --> 00:06:00,190
While you're here,
you've got to go through everything,

92
00:06:00,277 --> 00:06:01,813
- or else I'm giving it to the yard sale.
- Okay.

93
00:06:01,903 --> 00:06:04,190
- Okay?
- I'm fine, okay. I don't need my blankie.

94
00:06:14,916 --> 00:06:17,408
Well, as you can see, um...

95
00:06:17,502 --> 00:06:19,084
what's the point of redecorating?

96
00:06:19,963 --> 00:06:22,455
While you're here, I was hoping
you could help me pick up this stuff.

97
00:06:22,924 --> 00:06:27,468
I have a ton of boxes in the garage and
between the two of us it shouldn't take us...

98
00:06:30,181 --> 00:06:31,547
Do you still have the tapes?

99
00:06:46,448 --> 00:06:49,566
- This is it, huh?
- Yeah.

100
00:06:49,659 --> 00:06:52,117
That's the one. That's... how it all started.

101
00:06:58,293 --> 00:06:59,579
Oh, it's your turn.

102
00:06:59,669 --> 00:07:00,910
Sit down next to your sister.

103
00:07:01,004 --> 00:07:03,291
Come on. Now you know how I feel.

104
00:07:03,381 --> 00:07:05,589
- Okay. Okay.
- I want you to, uh,

105
00:07:05,675 --> 00:07:07,211
say something very sweet to your sister.

106
00:07:07,302 --> 00:07:09,840
A nice wish for her sixth year of life. Go.

107
00:07:12,891 --> 00:07:17,602
Okay. Well, Sophie,
I have one thing to say to you...

108
00:07:17,687 --> 00:07:20,851
Wow. Look at this.

109
00:07:20,941 --> 00:07:22,853
Whoa! Is that an airplane?

110
00:07:22,943 --> 00:07:24,309
I don't know.

111
00:07:25,570 --> 00:07:27,402
Oh! Josh! Careful!

112
00:07:27,489 --> 00:07:28,354
It's bright.

113
00:07:29,824 --> 00:07:30,905
Hold on.

114
00:07:30,992 --> 00:07:32,574
I don't think it's an airplane.

115
00:07:32,661 --> 00:07:33,822
- Hmm.
- Huh.

116
00:07:33,912 --> 00:07:35,528
Oh, look at that! A fourth one!

117
00:07:38,124 --> 00:07:41,663
They're in formation of some kind,
but they're not really moving.

118
00:07:41,753 --> 00:07:44,120
- Whoa!
- Whoa!

119
00:07:44,214 --> 00:07:46,547
Five, six, seven lights.

120
00:07:47,717 --> 00:07:49,549
Have you guys ever seen
anything like this before?

121
00:07:49,636 --> 00:07:51,719
- Hey!
- You see that.

122
00:07:51,805 --> 00:07:55,344
You see that? What is that?

123
00:07:55,433 --> 00:07:57,971
- Oh, my God.
- What is that?

124
00:07:58,061 --> 00:07:59,802
That's definitely not a plane.

125
00:07:59,896 --> 00:08:01,478
That's one object.

126
00:08:03,316 --> 00:08:05,228
- Wow, I've never seen anything like it.
- Oh, my God!

127
00:08:05,318 --> 00:08:07,184
- Honey, zoom in on it.
- I'm zooming, Mom.

128
00:08:07,278 --> 00:08:08,234
Okay. Okay.

129
00:08:08,363 --> 00:08:09,899
Whoa!

130
00:08:09,990 --> 00:08:12,323
- Whoa!
- They're aliens or something.

131
00:08:13,535 --> 00:08:16,198
- They're gone.
- That's weird.

132
00:08:16,287 --> 00:08:17,823
What was that?

133
00:08:19,541 --> 00:08:20,657
I don't know.

134
00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:22,912
- Where did they go?
- They're gone.

135
00:08:23,003 --> 00:08:25,962
Maybe they... they could have
gone behind the mountain maybe.

136
00:08:26,047 --> 00:08:28,460
- No, there's no clouds!
- Yeah, we saw the same thing.

137
00:08:28,550 --> 00:08:30,667
- That was interesting.
- That was a show, right?

138
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:32,592
- Yeah, right?
- Guys, you know what that was?

139
00:08:33,513 --> 00:08:35,175
- Those were UFOs!
- Oh, come on.

140
00:08:35,265 --> 00:08:37,257
Those were UFOs! That's what a UFO is!

141
00:08:37,350 --> 00:08:39,307
You guys, I think that's our cue to clean up.

142
00:08:39,394 --> 00:08:42,387
- We gotta... Right? Come on.
- Are you kidding me? Dad!

143
00:08:43,481 --> 00:08:46,019
Yeah, it was probably, um...

144
00:08:46,109 --> 00:08:47,350
I don't know, military.

145
00:08:47,444 --> 00:08:49,151
Yeah, we've got to get the presents, Josh.

146
00:08:51,740 --> 00:08:53,072
Josh, put the camera down

147
00:08:53,158 --> 00:08:55,024
- and just help your mother clean up, okay?
- Soph...

148
00:08:55,118 --> 00:08:56,734
what do you think that was?

149
00:08:56,828 --> 00:08:58,444
I don't know!

150
00:09:06,755 --> 00:09:08,462
Holy moly.

151
00:09:08,548 --> 00:09:10,039
You okay, Soph?

152
00:09:11,551 --> 00:09:12,837
You all right?

153
00:09:12,927 --> 00:09:14,088
Yeah.

154
00:09:17,140 --> 00:09:19,006
That was the Air Force, Dad!

155
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:21,057
Well, I hope it was our Air Force.

156
00:09:21,144 --> 00:09:22,601
Grandpa.

157
00:09:24,397 --> 00:09:25,683
That was amazing!

158
00:09:33,573 --> 00:09:35,439
When these lights appeared over Phoenix,

159
00:09:35,533 --> 00:09:39,243
people immediately thought:
UFOs. Outer space.

160
00:09:39,329 --> 00:09:41,537
- We were standing about here?
- Right about here.

161
00:09:41,623 --> 00:09:43,285
- Whoa!
- Whoa!

162
00:09:43,374 --> 00:09:45,832
They went just over the valley
toward South Mountain

163
00:09:45,919 --> 00:09:47,956
in like a...
what seemed to be a "V" formation,

164
00:09:48,922 --> 00:09:51,209
- It was definitely interesting.
- Mm-hmm.

165
00:09:51,299 --> 00:09:54,007
So far, the military
hasn't claimed any testing

166
00:09:54,094 --> 00:09:56,381
in the area from nearby Luke Air Force Base,

167
00:09:56,471 --> 00:09:58,212
which leaves many residents wondering

168
00:09:58,306 --> 00:10:00,423
"What were those mysterious lights?"

169
00:10:00,517 --> 00:10:02,975
It seemed like the Air Force didn't know
what it was, and if that's true,

170
00:10:03,061 --> 00:10:05,974
then what was it, you know? I don't know.

171
00:10:07,649 --> 00:10:10,266
And now I'll ask
Officer Stein and his colleagues

172
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:14,528
to escort the accused into the room so that
we may all look upon the guilty party.

173
00:10:14,614 --> 00:10:16,401
Don't get him too close to me, please.

174
00:10:16,491 --> 00:10:19,525
This just goes to show
that you guys are entirely too serious.

175
00:10:21,621 --> 00:10:24,284
No one really took it that
seriously from what I remember.

176
00:10:24,374 --> 00:10:25,581
Except Josh.

177
00:10:25,667 --> 00:10:26,908
Would you say he was sort of

178
00:10:27,001 --> 00:10:29,664
single-minded about stuff,
like, once he got an idea?

179
00:10:29,754 --> 00:10:31,791
Yeah. Yeah, there was no stopping him.

180
00:10:52,152 --> 00:10:55,441
Peeeeeew. Peeeew.

181
00:10:55,530 --> 00:10:57,396
Excuse me, sir, do you have
a second to talk about the...

182
00:10:57,490 --> 00:11:00,654
- Nope.
- ...Phoenix Lights? Okay, thank you.

183
00:11:00,743 --> 00:11:03,360
- It was just a "V" like this.
- And you saw that yourself?

184
00:11:03,454 --> 00:11:06,447
It was just a "V" like that, man.
And we were like...

185
00:11:06,541 --> 00:11:09,249
and we were like,
"Hey, man, check that out, man."

186
00:11:11,004 --> 00:11:14,213
I know... UFOs will come

187
00:11:15,175 --> 00:11:19,089
at us... and attack one day.

188
00:11:19,179 --> 00:11:21,136
- You think they'll attack?
- And if that happ...

189
00:11:21,222 --> 00:11:25,216
And if that happens, we will be prepared.

190
00:11:30,481 --> 00:11:31,642
So, did you see the lights?

191
00:11:32,442 --> 00:11:35,435
No, not personally.

192
00:11:35,528 --> 00:11:37,861
Okay, so you saw them on, like, the news?

193
00:11:37,947 --> 00:11:40,234
- Yeah.
- Awesome. Channel 3?

194
00:11:41,117 --> 00:11:42,198
No.

195
00:11:42,869 --> 00:11:44,280
It doesn't matter.

196
00:11:44,370 --> 00:11:46,953
Uh, do you think it was a UFO?

197
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:48,326
I don't know. Maybe.

198
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:52,208
- Okay, so, um...
- Can I ask you something now?

199
00:11:52,295 --> 00:11:54,287
- Yeah.
- Can I give you some advice?

200
00:11:54,380 --> 00:11:57,088
- Umm, sure. Yeah.
- This is an interview, right?

201
00:11:57,175 --> 00:11:59,212
- Yeah.
- So maybe you should ask me

202
00:11:59,302 --> 00:12:00,838
some open-ended questions.

203
00:12:00,929 --> 00:12:03,592
You know, like, things that don't
just warrant yes or no answers.

204
00:12:03,681 --> 00:12:05,172
Just, like, get me to talk...

205
00:12:05,266 --> 00:12:06,802
Okay, yeah. No. Sure.

206
00:12:07,727 --> 00:12:09,343
Is this the same place?

207
00:12:11,773 --> 00:12:16,359
She just had this charm
about her that was electric.

208
00:12:17,987 --> 00:12:21,151
I think because of that
she could get a lot out of people,

209
00:12:21,241 --> 00:12:23,779
people trusted her, saw her as a confidant.

210
00:12:25,745 --> 00:12:27,862
Jack was kind of pushing the lawyer thing,

211
00:12:27,956 --> 00:12:31,620
but truly I... I think
Ashley's passion was journalism.

212
00:12:35,213 --> 00:12:37,079
Good morning, Canyon Park High School.

213
00:12:37,173 --> 00:12:39,335
I'm Ashley Foster, CPTV.

214
00:12:40,802 --> 00:12:43,215
Just want to say hello to all the new
freshmen in the building.

215
00:12:43,304 --> 00:12:44,511
Welcome aboard.

216
00:12:45,765 --> 00:12:47,722
I know locker combinations can be tricky,

217
00:12:47,809 --> 00:12:49,892
but you'll make it through just like I did.

218
00:12:49,978 --> 00:12:51,719
So just keep trying.

219
00:12:51,813 --> 00:12:53,054
Together, we're a team...

220
00:12:54,065 --> 00:12:56,227
and this is not teamwork.

221
00:12:56,317 --> 00:12:58,650
- That's cute.
- Yeah.

222
00:12:58,736 --> 00:13:00,068
What did you guys think of Josh?

223
00:13:00,905 --> 00:13:01,986
We didn't know him.

224
00:13:04,659 --> 00:13:07,197
- Is that Josh's yearbook?
- Yeah, umm...

225
00:13:07,704 --> 00:13:08,785
Ashley signed it.

226
00:13:08,871 --> 00:13:10,078
- Oh really?
- Yeah.

227
00:13:10,164 --> 00:13:11,951
- There it is.
- Oh!

228
00:13:12,041 --> 00:13:13,907
Look at that.

229
00:13:15,837 --> 00:13:18,875
I mean, he was never one of these kids
that came over to the house.

230
00:13:20,842 --> 00:13:23,380
That's it. Josh Bishop.

231
00:13:24,887 --> 00:13:26,924
- Seems like she had a lot of friends.
- Oh, she did, yeah.

232
00:13:27,015 --> 00:13:28,847
She was a charmer.

233
00:13:28,933 --> 00:13:32,017
Have you ever... Have you ever heard
the story of Ezekiel's wheel?

234
00:13:33,021 --> 00:13:34,102
Umm...

235
00:13:35,732 --> 00:13:39,351
- It-It's from the Bible.
- Oh. Yeah. Definitely not.

236
00:13:39,444 --> 00:13:42,983
Ezekiel describes God
coming down from heaven in a chariot.

237
00:13:43,072 --> 00:13:46,190
It's lighting up the sky,
but all along the outside are eyes.

238
00:13:48,286 --> 00:13:49,697
Why would God need a spaceship?

239
00:13:49,787 --> 00:13:53,997
Exactly, because he is space.

240
00:13:56,002 --> 00:13:57,288
Yeah.

241
00:13:57,378 --> 00:13:59,165
- All right, we're done. It's cool.
- It's done?

242
00:13:59,255 --> 00:14:01,542
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Great. Okay. Bye.

243
00:14:01,632 --> 00:14:02,839
Thanks for doing it.

244
00:14:08,848 --> 00:14:12,637
A very sweet girl. I met her a few times.

245
00:14:12,727 --> 00:14:15,470
I definitely know that
Josh had a crush on her and...

246
00:14:17,148 --> 00:14:18,184
I'm hoping...

247
00:14:19,692 --> 00:14:21,900
Now I'm going to cry,
I'm hoping she liked him.

248
00:14:22,862 --> 00:14:24,649
Just because they...

249
00:14:25,740 --> 00:14:29,074
spent so much time together,
it would have been nice to know that he,

250
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:31,777
in his short life, could experience that.

251
00:14:36,667 --> 00:14:38,579
- That's Ashley's handwriting.
- Mm-hmm.

252
00:14:38,669 --> 00:14:42,876
And how much do you know about
what Ashley and Josh were working on?

253
00:14:42,965 --> 00:14:46,049
We certainly didn't know any of that until...

254
00:14:46,135 --> 00:14:47,251
- later.
- Later.

255
00:14:47,345 --> 00:14:49,632
- It was after.
- Yeah. Yeah.

256
00:14:49,722 --> 00:14:51,588
- We knew very little.
- Mm-hmm.

257
00:15:00,608 --> 00:15:02,975
We're going to meet with some astronomers.

258
00:15:03,069 --> 00:15:04,651
- Okay.
- They're going to have rocks

259
00:15:04,737 --> 00:15:06,899
and all different kinds of stuff to show us,

260
00:15:06,989 --> 00:15:09,697
so we've got to be prepared, and we need
to make sure that we're on our "A" game.

261
00:15:10,451 --> 00:15:12,113
What does our "A" game mean?

262
00:15:12,203 --> 00:15:14,320
We just have to be professional.

263
00:15:14,414 --> 00:15:18,624
But I'm feeling... I feel like I've been
pretty professional so far, thank you.

264
00:15:18,709 --> 00:15:20,996
I don't think I'm exactly amateur hour.

265
00:15:21,087 --> 00:15:23,249
I know, but I-I guess
I'm just a little nervous.

266
00:15:23,339 --> 00:15:24,500
I want everything to go good.

267
00:15:24,590 --> 00:15:26,547
Well, do you have any questions prepared?

268
00:15:26,634 --> 00:15:29,251
I have a ton, they're in my backpack.
Do you have my backpack by the way?

269
00:15:29,345 --> 00:15:30,756
Yeah, I do.

270
00:15:36,894 --> 00:15:39,307
Have you ever held a meteorite before?

271
00:15:40,356 --> 00:15:41,813
I'll start with this one.

272
00:15:42,942 --> 00:15:45,559
Whoa!

273
00:15:45,653 --> 00:15:49,863
We get phone calls about UFOs
kind of frequently.

274
00:15:49,949 --> 00:15:53,192
So when the Phoenix Lights happened,
were people calling and asking?

275
00:15:53,286 --> 00:15:55,903
Uh... yeah, they were.

276
00:15:55,997 --> 00:15:57,659
- A few.
- He shot the footage.

277
00:15:57,748 --> 00:16:00,616
- Oh, you shot the footage?
- That's right, yeah.

278
00:16:00,710 --> 00:16:03,794
Oh, congratulations! Can you learn to focus?

279
00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:05,496
There you go.

280
00:16:05,590 --> 00:16:07,627
They're in a formation of some kind,

281
00:16:07,717 --> 00:16:09,128
but they're not really moving.

282
00:16:09,218 --> 00:16:11,255
Okay, that's more likely flares.

283
00:16:13,890 --> 00:16:16,803
The flares are probably
fifty to a hundred miles away.

284
00:16:16,893 --> 00:16:20,136
So you don't see the smoke. You just see
a bright light that just hangs there

285
00:16:20,229 --> 00:16:22,596
because of the parachute
to hold them in place.

286
00:16:22,690 --> 00:16:24,727
Would you say you're
a hundred percent sure it's not

287
00:16:24,817 --> 00:16:27,901
or you're ninety-nine percent sure
and still open to the possibility?

288
00:16:27,987 --> 00:16:32,106
No, I'm a hundred percent sure
that-that-that... that that's what it was.

289
00:16:35,453 --> 00:16:38,537
- Oh! A jet.
- It's an F-18.

290
00:16:38,623 --> 00:16:40,410
- What was that?
- What did you say, Don?

291
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:42,787
- F-18.
- How do you know?

292
00:16:43,836 --> 00:16:45,372
He's got the ear for it.

293
00:16:47,798 --> 00:16:49,334
All right, I got as close as I could.

294
00:16:49,425 --> 00:16:52,338
There's this creepy guy
who was just staring me down.

295
00:16:52,428 --> 00:16:54,420
I think he was about to call security on me.

296
00:16:54,514 --> 00:16:56,130
You actually believe it was the Air Force.

297
00:16:56,224 --> 00:16:57,260
- You believe that...
- I do not.

298
00:16:57,350 --> 00:16:59,808
- You believe the bearded...
- I don't know what I believe yet!

299
00:16:59,894 --> 00:17:02,181
- I'm open...
- The bearded Galileo Society

300
00:17:02,271 --> 00:17:06,106
of Phoenix, Arizona. I'm disappointed.
You're no longer a producer.

301
00:17:06,192 --> 00:17:08,479
I am absolutely a producer!

302
00:17:23,376 --> 00:17:24,708
I think I found the section.

303
00:17:26,629 --> 00:17:29,121
"Ancient UFO sightings."

304
00:17:29,215 --> 00:17:31,832
Check this out. Petroglyphs.

305
00:17:31,926 --> 00:17:34,964
That's totally a spaceship.

306
00:17:35,054 --> 00:17:37,046
Isn't this that Bible thing
you were talking about?

307
00:17:37,139 --> 00:17:38,380
Ezekiel's wheel.

308
00:17:39,892 --> 00:17:41,884
Wait, I know what this reminds me of.

309
00:17:41,978 --> 00:17:43,640
It's like the machine at the end of Contact.

310
00:17:43,729 --> 00:17:45,015
I love that movie.

311
00:17:51,737 --> 00:17:53,774
Okay to go.

312
00:17:53,864 --> 00:17:55,947
Okay to go.

313
00:17:57,326 --> 00:17:59,192
- Initiate drop sequence.
- Okay to go!

314
00:17:59,287 --> 00:18:02,371
Oh, my God, Oh, my God. I think
I'm going through a wormhole!

315
00:18:08,087 --> 00:18:09,453
Okay.

316
00:18:13,676 --> 00:18:16,214
I don't want
to seem ungrateful for all the help,

317
00:18:16,304 --> 00:18:17,840
but what are we doing here?

318
00:18:19,140 --> 00:18:21,473
We should be, like, breaking into Area-51.

319
00:18:24,353 --> 00:18:26,936
Can you tell us
your name and what you do here?

320
00:18:27,023 --> 00:18:31,108
My name is Tony Duncan,
I'm from the Apache Nation.

321
00:18:31,193 --> 00:18:32,855
For the most part,
we do a lot of story-telling.

322
00:18:34,113 --> 00:18:36,947
A lot of our stories of creation talk about

323
00:18:37,033 --> 00:18:39,867
how at one time we were up in the lights,

324
00:18:39,952 --> 00:18:44,071
up in the sky world, so maybe it was
one of our peoples up there.

325
00:18:44,165 --> 00:18:45,827
So, you saw the lights last week?

326
00:18:45,916 --> 00:18:49,250
I didn't see them.
I didn't see them... that exact time,

327
00:18:49,337 --> 00:18:51,829
um, but I just heard
everyone's different stories.

328
00:18:51,922 --> 00:18:55,256
But then eventually, you know,
I seen all the footage of it.

329
00:18:55,343 --> 00:18:57,551
I first thought of the star people.

330
00:18:57,637 --> 00:19:00,675
"That must be them, our relatives."

331
00:19:00,765 --> 00:19:03,007
You said you didn't see them that exact time.

332
00:19:03,100 --> 00:19:06,264
- What did you mean?
- Yeah. Actually, um...

333
00:19:06,354 --> 00:19:09,472
way before the lights
that were seen in Phoenix,

334
00:19:09,565 --> 00:19:12,228
my friend that I grew up with...
his name is Pony...

335
00:19:13,611 --> 00:19:16,274
we actually seen some lights in the same way,

336
00:19:16,364 --> 00:19:18,196
but they were a lot closer,
and we followed them.

337
00:19:18,282 --> 00:19:19,989
- Wait.
- You saw the same formation?

338
00:19:20,076 --> 00:19:22,489
Yeah, yeah. They were in the sky,
and they were actually...

339
00:19:22,578 --> 00:19:24,820
they'd be here and then
they would take off really fast,

340
00:19:24,914 --> 00:19:26,621
and they would move around,

341
00:19:26,707 --> 00:19:29,950
and it was really exciting,
and then it went way out into the field.

342
00:19:30,044 --> 00:19:32,411
Like, we were running way out
into the field for a long time,

343
00:19:32,505 --> 00:19:34,371
our legs were getting all scratched up.

344
00:19:34,465 --> 00:19:37,003
Eventually, it just took off.

345
00:19:37,093 --> 00:19:40,006
Away, high upward. Just...
we couldn't see it anymore.

346
00:19:40,096 --> 00:19:44,340
Uh, but we still talk about that, Pony and I.

347
00:19:44,433 --> 00:19:48,222
Uh, but that was off over in Salt River,
in the Salt River Reservation.

348
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:53,181
The bus definitely doesn't go that far.

349
00:19:55,194 --> 00:19:57,402
That's where we're going.

350
00:19:57,488 --> 00:20:00,105
Well, that's where we're
deciding if we should go,

351
00:20:00,199 --> 00:20:03,067
to be more accurate.

352
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:06,278
Are you serious?
What, are you scared of sky people?

353
00:20:06,372 --> 00:20:07,954
Of being taken to the spirit world

354
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:09,656
- with the Anasazi.
- Well, I kind of believed him.

355
00:20:12,294 --> 00:20:13,580
Please come.

356
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:16,246
I need my producer, you know.

357
00:20:19,009 --> 00:20:21,467
I think it would make
a really sick documentary.

358
00:20:21,554 --> 00:20:23,671
I'll show it to colleges or... somebody.

359
00:20:28,477 --> 00:20:30,434
How do we get there?

360
00:20:34,066 --> 00:20:35,022
That's for me.

361
00:20:35,109 --> 00:20:36,645
Okay. Mark!

362
00:20:36,736 --> 00:20:38,728
- Mrs. Bishop.
- I haven't seen you in so long.

363
00:20:38,821 --> 00:20:40,608
- I know, how are you?
- Good, how are you?

364
00:20:40,698 --> 00:20:42,109
Hey.

365
00:20:42,199 --> 00:20:43,360
- You look great.
- Thank you.

366
00:20:43,451 --> 00:20:46,615
- Did you do something with your hair?
- Oh. Just got it done.

367
00:20:46,704 --> 00:20:48,195
- Are you serious?
- Thanks for noticing.

368
00:20:48,289 --> 00:20:50,155
- No problem.
- Can you stop flirting with my mom?

369
00:20:50,249 --> 00:20:52,161
I'm not flirting with your mom.

370
00:20:52,251 --> 00:20:53,708
She does look pretty good though.

371
00:20:56,547 --> 00:20:57,879
All right, go.

372
00:20:57,965 --> 00:21:00,919
And let's not forget our most important
piece of equipment on this journey...

373
00:21:02,803 --> 00:21:05,341
my 1994 Grand Jeep Cherokee.

374
00:21:05,431 --> 00:21:09,721
Six-cylinder engine,
blood-red finish, roof racks...

375
00:21:09,810 --> 00:21:13,099
16-inch clearance, perfect for maneuvering
over any desert...

376
00:21:16,901 --> 00:21:17,937
Sorry.

377
00:21:20,946 --> 00:21:22,562
...phenomenon has returned.

378
00:21:22,656 --> 00:21:24,318
- Oh, shit.
- For the second time in one week,

379
00:21:24,408 --> 00:21:26,866
mysterious lights have been spotted
over the Phoenix area...

380
00:21:26,952 --> 00:21:29,786
- Yo, Mark! Look at this!
- ...this time, over the suburb of Mesa.

381
00:21:29,872 --> 00:21:31,738
The sightings fascinated residents.

382
00:21:31,832 --> 00:21:33,994
It was completely silent.
You couldn't hear it,

383
00:21:34,084 --> 00:21:37,327
but you knew it was there.
It was just massive, it was big.

384
00:21:37,421 --> 00:21:40,334
Eye-witnesses
describe what they saw as being identical

385
00:21:40,424 --> 00:21:43,041
to the glowing orbs that passed
through the area earlier this week...

386
00:21:43,135 --> 00:21:45,001
Is that them? Are those your aliens?

387
00:21:45,095 --> 00:21:47,678
...a mysterious "V" formation
that flew from west to east.

388
00:21:47,765 --> 00:21:50,348
- The video you're seeing right now...
- Dude, I know where this is.

389
00:21:50,434 --> 00:21:51,641
...captured in Mesa
about ten miles from the...

390
00:21:52,978 --> 00:21:56,562
Wait, this is it, here on the right.
Right, right, right, right! Go!

391
00:21:56,649 --> 00:21:58,356
- Go, go, go, go, go!
- Shit. Let me know

392
00:21:58,442 --> 00:22:00,729
a little earlier next time.

393
00:22:02,488 --> 00:22:03,854
Jeez, man.

394
00:22:08,285 --> 00:22:09,275
Dang.

395
00:22:13,415 --> 00:22:16,453
This is it. This is where
they were, right over that ridge.

396
00:22:18,003 --> 00:22:20,086
Well...

397
00:22:20,172 --> 00:22:22,004
whatever they were, they're long gone now.

398
00:22:28,138 --> 00:22:29,299
Dude.

399
00:22:30,766 --> 00:22:31,927
Well, dude, check this out.

400
00:22:34,728 --> 00:22:35,809
Somebody's up there.

401
00:22:38,566 --> 00:22:41,934
You do realize we gotta get up
in, like, six hours, right?

402
00:22:42,027 --> 00:22:43,609
Dude, we're almost to the top.

403
00:22:45,030 --> 00:22:46,487
All right.

404
00:22:48,284 --> 00:22:49,445
Whoa!

405
00:22:49,535 --> 00:22:50,776
Get down.

406
00:22:54,832 --> 00:22:57,791
Dude, kill the light.
What are you doing? Josh?

407
00:23:04,633 --> 00:23:06,295
Josh, let's get the hell out of here.

408
00:23:06,385 --> 00:23:07,592
Just hang on.

409
00:23:08,679 --> 00:23:10,261
Man, those are cops up there.

410
00:23:14,226 --> 00:23:16,138
Dude, there's no plates.

411
00:23:16,228 --> 00:23:17,719
I don't care, let's go.

412
00:23:25,154 --> 00:23:27,271
They're just cops.

413
00:23:27,364 --> 00:23:29,947
Dude, cops don't walk around in
the middle of the night with telescopes.

414
00:23:34,163 --> 00:23:35,279
They're looking for it.

415
00:23:36,832 --> 00:23:38,243
What?

416
00:23:38,334 --> 00:23:40,621
- The UFO.
- Josh, I don't care. Let's go.

417
00:23:40,711 --> 00:23:43,249
- That's what they're looking for.
- Oh, my God.

418
00:23:45,174 --> 00:23:46,710
- Hey!
- Oh shit!

419
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:48,086
Run, bitch!

420
00:23:48,177 --> 00:23:49,634
Run! Come on!

421
00:23:55,392 --> 00:24:00,137
Okay, so this is the first sighting
right above South Mountain.

422
00:24:00,230 --> 00:24:02,096
This is the second.

423
00:24:03,776 --> 00:24:06,018
And this is where we're going,

424
00:24:06,111 --> 00:24:08,444
right in the flight path of the first two.
Nobody knows about this.

425
00:24:09,239 --> 00:24:10,400
I told you.

426
00:24:10,491 --> 00:24:12,198
I guess we'll find out tomorrow.

427
00:24:17,456 --> 00:24:19,288
This was an unusual case.

428
00:24:19,375 --> 00:24:21,332
What do you mean
it was unusual? In what sense?

429
00:24:21,418 --> 00:24:24,582
Uh, well... it's very uncommon to have
three kids go missing at the same time.

430
00:24:24,672 --> 00:24:26,789
- Just because there were three of them?
- There were three, yeah.

431
00:24:26,882 --> 00:24:28,919
It is usually one, maybe two,

432
00:24:29,009 --> 00:24:32,218
boyfriend-girlfriend,
but the fact that there were three,

433
00:24:32,304 --> 00:24:34,261
you know, set it outside of the norm.

434
00:24:36,517 --> 00:24:38,224
What did you guys use to get to drink?

435
00:24:38,310 --> 00:24:43,226
I always got lemonade but Mark,
he'd always go for a suicide.

436
00:24:43,315 --> 00:24:45,773
All the way down. Dash of everything.

437
00:24:49,196 --> 00:24:52,655
Do you remember
the night that you got the call?

438
00:24:54,410 --> 00:24:56,652
Sure. Yeah. Um...

439
00:24:56,745 --> 00:24:59,283
I was in my first year at ASU,

440
00:24:59,373 --> 00:25:01,615
and I got a call late at night from my mom

441
00:25:01,709 --> 00:25:03,826
saying that Mark hadn't come home.

442
00:25:06,463 --> 00:25:10,924
My dad was convinced that l'd taken him
to some frat party and gotten him drunk.

443
00:25:11,844 --> 00:25:13,255
He was pissed off.

444
00:25:14,847 --> 00:25:16,509
He was even more pissed than Ashley's dad,

445
00:25:16,598 --> 00:25:19,181
if you can believe that.

446
00:25:19,268 --> 00:25:22,852
My mom told me that if I just got
them home ASAP, I wouldn't get in trouble.

447
00:25:24,023 --> 00:25:26,140
They just... they refused to believe me.

448
00:25:27,860 --> 00:25:29,396
I didn't realize at the time that I was

449
00:25:29,486 --> 00:25:31,569
the last reasonable explanation that they had

450
00:25:31,655 --> 00:25:34,398
before they started to freak out for real.

451
00:25:37,327 --> 00:25:38,863
Officer...

452
00:25:38,954 --> 00:25:40,365
Is someone there?

453
00:25:40,456 --> 00:25:43,870
Possible 11-24 on the side of the highway.

454
00:25:45,919 --> 00:25:48,662
No, no one inside.

455
00:25:48,756 --> 00:25:51,169
- Copy that, 11-24.
- 10-4.

456
00:25:57,431 --> 00:25:59,388
Should I put my phone in airplane mode?

457
00:25:59,475 --> 00:26:01,307
It won't affect the flight at all

458
00:26:01,393 --> 00:26:03,385
- if you don't put it in.
- All right.

459
00:26:03,479 --> 00:26:06,313
- I use that on planes.
- Yeah, that's bull crap.

460
00:26:18,368 --> 00:26:20,735
The reason I wanted to talk
to you was because you were involved

461
00:26:20,829 --> 00:26:23,663
- in the search for my brother.
- I was.

462
00:26:23,749 --> 00:26:26,992
Um, can you tell me
a little bit about... about that?

463
00:26:27,711 --> 00:26:28,918
Strange case.

464
00:26:30,923 --> 00:26:32,710
That's where the car was found.

465
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:34,086
Right down there?

466
00:26:40,724 --> 00:26:43,808
Do you think someone could have
forced them off the road?

467
00:26:43,894 --> 00:26:46,307
It's possible, but I doubt it.

468
00:26:46,396 --> 00:26:50,106
It seems like they left
the car here intentionally.

469
00:26:50,192 --> 00:26:51,933
What do you mean, "intentionally"?

470
00:26:52,027 --> 00:26:54,986
Oh, the car was parked perfectly in line,

471
00:26:55,072 --> 00:26:57,815
so it didn't seem like
they were in a rush or anything.

472
00:26:59,785 --> 00:27:03,278
The doors were locked.
We didn't find the keys.

473
00:27:03,372 --> 00:27:04,988
It was functional. It... it ran.

474
00:27:05,082 --> 00:27:08,166
It wasn't like it ran out of gas
or the battery died out there.

475
00:27:08,252 --> 00:27:09,459
They were able to start it up.

476
00:27:09,545 --> 00:27:11,958
And we found some beers in the car.

477
00:27:12,047 --> 00:27:14,084
Some beers? Like, they were drinking?

478
00:27:14,174 --> 00:27:17,884
Yeah. Just a couple of beers. We really
don't know if that means anything.

479
00:27:19,263 --> 00:27:23,348
There were traces of blood,
and we think it was Mark's.

480
00:27:25,978 --> 00:27:27,389
And your brother's camera, of course.

481
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:35,101
This is the one they found in the car.

482
00:27:40,868 --> 00:27:45,112
The Diamondbacks are
the snakes that you want to look out for.

483
00:27:45,205 --> 00:27:46,696
Some dude died.

484
00:27:47,875 --> 00:27:49,992
I guess he was climbing over, like, a ridge

485
00:27:50,085 --> 00:27:52,202
and it struck, and it hit him in the neck.

486
00:27:54,590 --> 00:27:56,126
You dick!

487
00:27:56,216 --> 00:27:58,048
What?

488
00:27:58,135 --> 00:27:59,922
Are you serious? What about her parents, huh?

489
00:28:00,012 --> 00:28:01,548
You're the one who wants to hit the road.

490
00:28:01,638 --> 00:28:03,425
You want to get in trouble
before we even leave?

491
00:28:03,515 --> 00:28:04,881
- God.
- Now she comes out.

492
00:28:06,560 --> 00:28:08,096
Well. I guess it worked.

493
00:28:08,187 --> 00:28:11,180
It's 7:30 in the morning, you dicks.

494
00:28:11,273 --> 00:28:13,435
All right, well, there's a lot of dicks

495
00:28:13,525 --> 00:28:14,982
getting thrown at the driver right now.

496
00:28:15,068 --> 00:28:17,776
- What?
- All right, you guys ready?

497
00:28:25,329 --> 00:28:27,446
- Josh, do you have all the equipment?
- Can you move your camera?

498
00:28:27,539 --> 00:28:29,121
Yeah, no, we're good, we're good.

499
00:28:29,208 --> 00:28:31,040
Are you sure we shouldn't double check?

500
00:28:31,126 --> 00:28:32,742
'Cause once we're gone, we're gone.

501
00:28:32,836 --> 00:28:35,670
- Okay, go, go. Please drive.
- What?

502
00:28:35,756 --> 00:28:38,294
- It's just I don't want to talk to my dad.
- He looks like a sweet man.

503
00:28:38,383 --> 00:28:40,466
Yeah, until you meet him.

504
00:28:42,262 --> 00:28:43,753
Wait, when do you guys have to be home by?

505
00:28:43,847 --> 00:28:46,885
My parents aren't as concerned.

506
00:28:46,975 --> 00:28:49,467
My mom just like won't go
to sleep until I'm home.

507
00:28:50,854 --> 00:28:52,470
Different when you're a girl...

508
00:28:52,564 --> 00:28:55,181
- No, no, a hundred percent.
- ...with two men.

509
00:28:55,275 --> 00:28:57,232
- Hey look! Look, Josh.
- It would say Interstate.

510
00:28:57,319 --> 00:28:59,936
Look at this. It looks like
those petroglyphs in that book.

511
00:29:00,030 --> 00:29:02,022
- Those were clearly made...
- Quick, shoot that.

512
00:29:02,115 --> 00:29:03,105
...by alien spacecraft.

513
00:29:05,118 --> 00:29:10,705
# Arizona, take off your hobo shoes #

514
00:29:10,791 --> 00:29:15,161
# Arizona, hey, won'tcha go my way #

515
00:29:15,254 --> 00:29:17,462
I can tell 'em a little something.

516
00:29:17,547 --> 00:29:20,415
# Unh, Arizona, Unh #

517
00:29:20,509 --> 00:29:22,922
# So hot and fresh, giving me a boner #

518
00:29:23,011 --> 00:29:24,752
# Unh, rock and roller #

519
00:29:24,846 --> 00:29:27,714
# Unh, bowler, Coca-Cola #

520
00:29:27,808 --> 00:29:29,470
# Solar plexus #

521
00:29:29,559 --> 00:29:31,516
# 'Cause we're better than Texas #

522
00:29:31,603 --> 00:29:33,515
# 'Cause we're so big and fierce #

523
00:29:33,605 --> 00:29:35,141
# Call us T-Rexes #

524
00:29:35,232 --> 00:29:38,066
# Look at our faces,
I know you wanna sex us! #

525
00:29:38,151 --> 00:29:39,483
Whoo!

526
00:29:39,569 --> 00:29:44,405
# Arizona, take off your rainbow shades #

527
00:29:44,491 --> 00:29:47,700
# Arizona,
have another look at the world... #

528
00:29:54,584 --> 00:29:58,453
What happened between here
and when they left the car...

529
00:29:58,547 --> 00:30:00,163
you see that's the mystery.

530
00:30:07,723 --> 00:30:12,058
Wouldn't know if it was
a couple of hours or maybe a whole day.

531
00:30:12,144 --> 00:30:14,386
That's the hole we're trying to fill.

532
00:30:18,150 --> 00:30:21,191
Another day in the desert,
searching for clues for three missing teens.

533
00:30:21,278 --> 00:30:24,237
So the ground search was odd,
'cause it turned up almost nothing.

534
00:30:24,323 --> 00:30:26,565
Normally in a case like that
where people turn up missing

535
00:30:26,658 --> 00:30:30,902
and then we find a vehicle,
um, they locate something.

536
00:30:30,996 --> 00:30:34,489
And there were no effective trails
that led us one direction or another

537
00:30:34,583 --> 00:30:36,449
and even when they used their dogs out there.

538
00:30:36,543 --> 00:30:39,536
After two days of searching,
a small army of law officers

539
00:30:39,629 --> 00:30:41,586
are setting up camp
alongside a desert highway.

540
00:30:41,673 --> 00:30:43,335
People that are on the ground tell you that,

541
00:30:43,425 --> 00:30:46,259
"Hey, the one gal has
a bright yellow shirt or something."

542
00:30:46,345 --> 00:30:49,088
So that's something that you're gonna
try to key on as looking down.

543
00:30:50,432 --> 00:30:52,640
And you just go back and forth,

544
00:30:52,726 --> 00:30:54,217
kind of like mowing the yard.

545
00:30:58,899 --> 00:31:00,640
It looks very flat from the air,

546
00:31:00,734 --> 00:31:03,351
but when you get down on the ground
and you start walking around

547
00:31:03,445 --> 00:31:08,861
even the smallest bit of terrain, there is
a lot of... lot of places they could be.

548
00:31:08,950 --> 00:31:11,192
Now anyone with any information
about this case

549
00:31:11,286 --> 00:31:12,868
is asked to call a special tip line...

550
00:31:14,039 --> 00:31:16,076
If you'd have asked me
at the front end, "Are we going

551
00:31:16,166 --> 00:31:18,658
to find these kids," I would have said,
"Yeah. Oh, yeah, we'll find them."

552
00:31:18,752 --> 00:31:21,369
Three things to look for. Three shirts.

553
00:31:21,463 --> 00:31:23,750
I don't want to be morbid, but three bodies.

554
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:26,503
I mean, there's-there's more...
there's more to search for.

555
00:31:27,469 --> 00:31:28,835
We just found nothing.

556
00:31:30,263 --> 00:31:32,880
So if you were to speculate,
what do you think happened to them?

557
00:31:32,974 --> 00:31:35,182
Maybe if I wasn't on camera or something,

558
00:31:35,268 --> 00:31:37,760
I think maybe I could give you some opinions,

559
00:31:37,854 --> 00:31:39,720
but, um, it's hard to speculate.

560
00:31:41,608 --> 00:31:44,476
Okay, so what do you think happened?

561
00:31:44,569 --> 00:31:47,482
There's potentially some sort
of relationship issue.

562
00:31:47,572 --> 00:31:50,030
One boy likes the girl,
and the girl likes the other boy,

563
00:31:50,117 --> 00:31:53,155
and the two boys find out about the issue.

564
00:31:53,245 --> 00:31:55,407
Maybe somebody came along and picked them up

565
00:31:55,497 --> 00:31:58,535
and could have taken them somewhere,
but they should have surfaced.

566
00:31:58,625 --> 00:32:00,082
Foul play is possible,

567
00:32:00,168 --> 00:32:02,205
but it's very tough
if only one person did it.

568
00:32:02,295 --> 00:32:05,254
It's very difficult to hold three people,
you know, together.

569
00:32:05,340 --> 00:32:07,707
It could just be someone
out there that's running some dope.

570
00:32:07,801 --> 00:32:09,793
They were just
in the wrong place at the wrong time.

571
00:32:09,886 --> 00:32:12,299
Wrong place wrong time.
Stumble upon something that was five miles

572
00:32:12,389 --> 00:32:14,176
from where they were,
where the vehicle was located,

573
00:32:14,266 --> 00:32:15,632
and they were driven to that loca...

574
00:32:16,977 --> 00:32:20,345
Like I said, we didn't find anything,
so who knows what happened?

575
00:32:20,439 --> 00:32:21,896
Hard to speculate.

576
00:32:27,028 --> 00:32:29,236
How did you meet Josh?

577
00:32:29,322 --> 00:32:31,939
I feel weird talking about this,
'cause I know he's gonna watch it later.

578
00:32:32,033 --> 00:32:35,151
We met, uh... we met in church actually.

579
00:32:35,245 --> 00:32:36,781
- Really?
- Yeah.

580
00:32:36,872 --> 00:32:41,287
Everybody called Josh, "Ginger,"
and they were making fun of him,

581
00:32:41,376 --> 00:32:43,333
like, calling him "Ginger"
because of his red hair,

582
00:32:43,420 --> 00:32:46,629
but when I was little, I didn't know
"Ginger" was a name for redheads.

583
00:32:46,715 --> 00:32:50,504
I just thought it was a nickname,
like, specifically for Josh.

584
00:32:50,594 --> 00:32:54,508
So I just thought the coolest kid at
Sunday school... everybody knew who he was,

585
00:32:54,598 --> 00:32:56,339
so I went out of my way to hang out with him.

586
00:32:56,433 --> 00:32:59,050
That's when we started becoming friends.

587
00:32:59,144 --> 00:33:00,476
Oh, nice.

588
00:33:02,481 --> 00:33:04,814
I just got some B-roll,
but I got some really cool cactuses...

589
00:33:04,900 --> 00:33:07,233
Were you guys filming me while I was asleep?

590
00:33:07,319 --> 00:33:08,981
- No.
- No. Never.

591
00:33:09,070 --> 00:33:11,437
Okay, a little bit.

592
00:33:11,531 --> 00:33:13,693
- Can you put your seatbelt back on?
- Yeah.

593
00:33:16,244 --> 00:33:18,577
- Yeah.
- Literally nothing out here.

594
00:33:22,083 --> 00:33:23,494
Hello!

595
00:33:25,378 --> 00:33:27,620
You're gonna get
your head taken off by one of those.

596
00:33:30,717 --> 00:33:33,175
- I wanna live here.
- You wanna live here?

597
00:33:33,261 --> 00:33:35,719
Yeah. Maybe.

598
00:33:35,805 --> 00:33:37,467
Whoa, whoa, watch out!

599
00:33:37,557 --> 00:33:40,470
- God!
- Sorry, guys. My bad.

600
00:33:40,560 --> 00:33:42,597
- Whoa, check that out.
- What? What is it?

601
00:33:42,687 --> 00:33:45,725
Dead animal. A coyote?

602
00:33:45,815 --> 00:33:47,977
- Is it two?
- Yeah.

603
00:33:48,068 --> 00:33:49,900
- Yeah, it is.
- Hold on, this camera sucks.

604
00:33:53,281 --> 00:33:55,022
- So that's it?
- That's it.

605
00:33:55,116 --> 00:33:57,859
That's the last he shot.

606
00:33:57,953 --> 00:34:00,320
Hang on. So Josh went all the way out there

607
00:34:00,413 --> 00:34:02,370
and then just didn't shoot
anything past the road?

608
00:34:02,457 --> 00:34:03,868
Doesn't that seem weird to you?

609
00:34:07,754 --> 00:34:09,837
I always thought it was a little odd.

610
00:34:09,923 --> 00:34:11,505
Why? Why odd?

611
00:34:11,591 --> 00:34:13,298
Well, your brother...

612
00:34:13,385 --> 00:34:17,049
He seemed to have that camera
glued to his face all the time.

613
00:34:17,138 --> 00:34:19,596
It-It just didn't make
any sense to leave it behind.

614
00:34:21,977 --> 00:34:24,264
So do you think
maybe they had a second camera?

615
00:34:24,354 --> 00:34:25,595
Like, is that a possibility?

616
00:34:25,689 --> 00:34:27,180
I thought about that.

617
00:34:27,274 --> 00:34:29,891
I-I still think your brother
would have had that with him.

618
00:34:29,985 --> 00:34:31,772
I know Ashley had access

619
00:34:31,861 --> 00:34:34,228
to those camera equipment
and could check out,

620
00:34:34,322 --> 00:34:38,657
but I don't remember anything
being unaccounted for at the time.

621
00:34:38,743 --> 00:34:41,360
We... we ran that thread out
as far as we could,

622
00:34:41,454 --> 00:34:44,659
and we just couldn't take it, and law
enforcement couldn't take it anywhere either.

623
00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:51,458
So that's what the kids would
have been using back in '97, right?

624
00:34:51,548 --> 00:34:53,631
It's a little before my time,

625
00:34:53,717 --> 00:34:56,710
but yeah, probably.

626
00:34:56,803 --> 00:34:58,965
Do you still have any
of those old cameras laying around?

627
00:34:59,639 --> 00:35:00,720
Yeah.

628
00:35:04,519 --> 00:35:06,932
I'm Ashley Foster, CPTV.

629
00:35:07,022 --> 00:35:09,435
Just want to say hello to all
the new freshmen in the building.

630
00:35:09,524 --> 00:35:10,765
Where did you get this?

631
00:35:10,859 --> 00:35:13,021
This was found in Mark Abrams' Jeep

632
00:35:13,111 --> 00:35:16,070
after he went missing
with Ashley and with my brother.

633
00:35:16,156 --> 00:35:18,569
We think Josh had
a second camera with him on the trip.

634
00:35:18,658 --> 00:35:21,401
If he did have one,
it most likely came from the school,

635
00:35:21,494 --> 00:35:24,157
so I was wondering if you thought Ashley
could have checked one out from here,

636
00:35:24,247 --> 00:35:26,159
like, maybe she used a different name?

637
00:35:26,249 --> 00:35:29,868
It's possible, but like I said,
it was before I started.

638
00:35:29,961 --> 00:35:32,419
Would there have been, like,
a logbook or records of that?

639
00:35:32,505 --> 00:35:34,417
- Like, stuff that might have been...
- It's been 20 years.

640
00:35:35,884 --> 00:35:38,046
I'm so sorry I can't be of more help to you.

641
00:35:40,805 --> 00:35:44,094
Even if they had a second camera,
it just... it went missing with them.

642
00:35:48,021 --> 00:35:49,683
Just another dead end, you know?

643
00:35:52,942 --> 00:35:54,524
And new developments tonight.

644
00:35:54,611 --> 00:35:57,820
Rescuers were forced to call off
their search for three missing teens,

645
00:35:57,906 --> 00:36:00,990
saying there was "no new
credible evidence or clues

646
00:36:01,076 --> 00:36:02,738
to guide the search."

647
00:36:02,827 --> 00:36:04,363
It's like they've been written off.

648
00:36:04,454 --> 00:36:08,322
They've been... my son and his friends have
been abandoned by the police department.

649
00:36:08,416 --> 00:36:09,907
All the efforts by law enforcement

650
00:36:10,001 --> 00:36:11,788
to develop some evidence as to what happened,

651
00:36:11,878 --> 00:36:14,791
they were pretty... well, they were negative.

652
00:36:14,881 --> 00:36:17,123
They could never go anywhere with the case.

653
00:36:18,176 --> 00:36:21,089
I think if they had kids, they'd want
somebody looking for their kid.

654
00:36:30,939 --> 00:36:32,555
Dear Ashley,

655
00:36:34,275 --> 00:36:36,267
I know that you're alive...

656
00:36:36,361 --> 00:36:39,399
and that you can hear my voice right now.

657
00:36:41,241 --> 00:36:45,360
You can't imagine how much your father
and I miss you... and love you.

658
00:36:47,789 --> 00:36:49,781
Every night, I have a dream

659
00:36:49,874 --> 00:36:53,208
that I come downstairs
and you're sitting at the table

660
00:36:53,294 --> 00:36:54,705
like you were never even gone.

661
00:36:56,256 --> 00:36:58,293
I know this means something.

662
00:36:58,383 --> 00:37:02,798
I know it means that you... are still alive.

663
00:37:04,681 --> 00:37:07,549
Your father and I will never give up hope.

664
00:37:07,642 --> 00:37:10,726
I love you, Ashley. Please come home.

665
00:37:17,402 --> 00:37:18,893
I wanted a funeral...

666
00:37:20,947 --> 00:37:23,439
but Jack wouldn't have it.

667
00:37:23,533 --> 00:37:25,695
So, here we are.

668
00:37:28,163 --> 00:37:29,779
The bench was a compromise?

669
00:37:29,873 --> 00:37:31,865
Yep. That's what marriage is about.

670
00:37:50,393 --> 00:37:52,851
It's... uh... Sophie, I don't...

671
00:37:52,937 --> 00:37:54,553
I don't think your brother's alive.

672
00:37:54,647 --> 00:37:56,980
I-I... I don't think... I don't think he is.

673
00:37:57,066 --> 00:37:58,477
I think something would have developed.

674
00:38:02,739 --> 00:38:04,150
Jay, get in here.

675
00:38:06,785 --> 00:38:08,401
- What's up?
- Have you seen this?

676
00:38:12,040 --> 00:38:15,124
If you'd been here ten years ago
and standing out here and looking up there

677
00:38:15,210 --> 00:38:17,418
at the lights and the view, um,

678
00:38:17,504 --> 00:38:19,416
you would have been astounded.
You would have been amazed.

679
00:38:19,506 --> 00:38:22,670
- Is that the governor?
- Yeah.

680
00:38:22,759 --> 00:38:25,001
Twenty years ago,
he said the lights were a joke.

681
00:38:25,094 --> 00:38:27,882
He had a whole press conference
making fun of them.

682
00:38:27,972 --> 00:38:29,884
And now he's saying
he saw the lights that night.

683
00:38:29,974 --> 00:38:31,340
I got four of 'em.

684
00:38:31,434 --> 00:38:33,426
He's basically admitting he lied.

685
00:38:33,520 --> 00:38:36,183
The former governor,
a Vietnam Air Force veteran,

686
00:38:36,272 --> 00:38:39,811
had never publicly
acknowledged seeing it until now.

687
00:38:39,901 --> 00:38:41,767
And I suspect that...

688
00:38:41,861 --> 00:38:44,899
unless the Defense Department
proves this otherwise,

689
00:38:44,989 --> 00:38:48,448
that it was probably some form
of an alien spacecraft.

690
00:38:48,535 --> 00:38:52,370
And I think as a public figure, you have
to be very careful about what you say,

691
00:38:52,455 --> 00:38:56,699
because people can have
pretty emotional reactions.

692
00:39:08,721 --> 00:39:09,837
Is that him?

693
00:39:14,894 --> 00:39:16,681
Okay, follow me and just keep rolling.

694
00:39:22,819 --> 00:39:23,809
Excuse me, Mr. Garland?

695
00:39:25,154 --> 00:39:26,770
Hi, I'm Sophie Bishop. We spoke on the phone.

696
00:39:26,865 --> 00:39:28,527
I'm sorry, I can't help you.

697
00:39:28,616 --> 00:39:30,573
Right, I just have a couple questions.

698
00:39:30,660 --> 00:39:33,744
You worked for the governor from 1992
until he resigned in '97, is that right?

699
00:39:33,830 --> 00:39:35,947
Sophie, I don't know anything
about your brother.

700
00:39:36,040 --> 00:39:37,406
Okay, what about the Phoenix Lights?

701
00:39:37,500 --> 00:39:39,742
On March 15th, 1997, you went on TV,

702
00:39:39,836 --> 00:39:41,828
and you said that they were military flares.

703
00:39:41,921 --> 00:39:44,834
Did you see the Governor
on CNN saying that was a lie?

704
00:39:44,924 --> 00:39:46,290
You were his press secretary at the time.

705
00:39:46,384 --> 00:39:48,046
Listen, I really am very sorry
about your brother.

706
00:39:48,136 --> 00:39:49,798
We were just trying not to create a panic.

707
00:39:49,888 --> 00:39:51,424
Who told you to lie?

708
00:39:55,268 --> 00:39:57,180
I mean, what if Josh was on to something?

709
00:39:58,813 --> 00:40:01,396
We always assumed he got lost
or kidnapped or...

710
00:40:03,610 --> 00:40:05,727
murdered but what if...

711
00:40:07,071 --> 00:40:08,858
What if he got abducted by aliens?

712
00:40:12,702 --> 00:40:14,614
Jesus, I sound like him, don't I?

713
00:40:17,040 --> 00:40:19,373
So... now what?

714
00:40:22,211 --> 00:40:23,292
I don't know.

715
00:40:27,008 --> 00:40:28,749
I don't know what we're doing here anymore.

716
00:40:36,851 --> 00:40:38,137
Can't believe you're leaving.

717
00:40:38,227 --> 00:40:39,513
It feels like you just got here.

718
00:40:41,564 --> 00:40:43,351
Can I ask you one more question?

719
00:40:46,527 --> 00:40:48,735
Why did you and Dad decide to call it quits?

720
00:40:50,406 --> 00:40:52,363
Sweetheart, everyone's divorced now.

721
00:40:52,450 --> 00:40:54,567
I want to know. Was it Josh's disappearance

722
00:40:54,661 --> 00:40:57,699
or would you guys have split up anyway?

723
00:41:13,846 --> 00:41:16,839
Hello!

724
00:41:16,933 --> 00:41:19,141
You're going to get
your head taken off by one of those.

725
00:41:19,227 --> 00:41:20,763
I want to live here.

726
00:41:20,853 --> 00:41:23,721
- You want to live here?
- Yeah. Maybe.

727
00:41:25,316 --> 00:41:26,932
Josh, you want to stop here?

728
00:41:43,626 --> 00:41:45,367
- Well, how is she?
- She's good.

729
00:41:45,461 --> 00:41:48,124
Just getting ready
for the big move, you know.

730
00:41:48,214 --> 00:41:52,253
Well, please tell her, you know, if she needs
any help or anything, she should call me.

731
00:41:55,596 --> 00:41:57,303
Somebody knows what happened.

732
00:41:59,267 --> 00:42:01,054
Mark didn't just wander off into the desert.

733
00:42:01,144 --> 00:42:02,510
He didn't get lost.

734
00:42:02,603 --> 00:42:04,344
That never made sense to me.

735
00:42:09,610 --> 00:42:11,602
If Josh hadn't gone missing...

736
00:42:11,696 --> 00:42:13,528
do you think you and Mom
would still be together?

737
00:42:14,323 --> 00:42:15,313
Yeah.

738
00:42:16,617 --> 00:42:17,983
What'd she say?

739
00:42:18,077 --> 00:42:20,194
Sweetheart, what happened was
your brother went missing.

740
00:42:21,164 --> 00:42:22,405
Completely missing.

741
00:42:23,332 --> 00:42:25,073
And it took over our lives.

742
00:42:26,085 --> 00:42:28,122
...resources to make sure
these teenagers are found.

743
00:42:34,844 --> 00:42:37,302
If that's true, then what was it,

744
00:42:37,388 --> 00:42:39,050
you know? I don't know.

745
00:42:39,140 --> 00:42:41,507
Is Josh dead? Is he alive?

746
00:42:42,435 --> 00:42:43,721
Was he suffering?

747
00:42:43,811 --> 00:42:48,351
Our relationship became about
all those questions,

748
00:42:48,441 --> 00:42:50,023
and your father, he couldn't do it anymore

749
00:42:50,109 --> 00:42:52,146
and still be the man
that I fell in love with,

750
00:42:52,236 --> 00:42:54,444
and I couldn't do it anymore
and still be his wife.

751
00:42:59,368 --> 00:43:02,361
Everybody keeps criticizing me
for, you know, not dealing with it.

752
00:43:02,455 --> 00:43:04,663
I was the only one who was still out there

753
00:43:04,749 --> 00:43:06,581
trying to figure out
what happened to your brother.

754
00:43:10,213 --> 00:43:12,956
Do you think there's ever going to
be a point where you can let it go, Dad?

755
00:43:16,761 --> 00:43:18,673
I mean, show... show me his body.

756
00:43:26,521 --> 00:43:28,478
- Good to see you.
- Love you.

757
00:43:28,564 --> 00:43:30,897
- I love you, too.
- Okay.

758
00:43:30,983 --> 00:43:33,270
All right. Do me a favor:
When you get home, give me a call, okay?

759
00:43:33,361 --> 00:43:34,818
- Okay.
- Let me know you got in okay.

760
00:43:34,904 --> 00:43:36,111
- Yeah.
- Okay.

761
00:43:36,197 --> 00:43:38,530
- We're going to see you Christmas?
- Yeah, I'll see you Christmas.

762
00:43:38,616 --> 00:43:39,823
- Okay.
- Okay.

763
00:43:39,909 --> 00:43:41,070
- All right.
- Love you.

764
00:43:41,160 --> 00:43:42,401
I love you.

765
00:43:42,495 --> 00:43:43,827
- Bye, Dad.
- Bye.

766
00:44:01,722 --> 00:44:04,089
Hi, Sophie, this is Luisa. Luisa Moreno.

767
00:44:04,183 --> 00:44:06,846
We spoke several months ago
at Canyon Park High.

768
00:44:06,936 --> 00:44:10,805
Um... just call me back when you can.

769
00:44:11,941 --> 00:44:13,352
Hi.

770
00:44:15,403 --> 00:44:17,360
- Thank you so much for meeting me.
- Yeah.

771
00:44:19,073 --> 00:44:20,484
Did you have a hard time finding the place?

772
00:44:20,575 --> 00:44:22,191
- No, no, not at all.
- Great.

773
00:44:23,327 --> 00:44:26,536
This place has been on the books
since the late '70s.

774
00:44:26,622 --> 00:44:29,660
Pretty much anything old
or outdated gets thrown in here.

775
00:44:29,750 --> 00:44:31,958
I was throwing away
some garbage over the weekend

776
00:44:32,044 --> 00:44:34,787
and just saw it sitting in the drawer.

777
00:44:34,881 --> 00:44:36,964
Somebody must have thrown it
in here and forgotten about it.

778
00:45:06,412 --> 00:45:08,529
- Can I take this?
- Oh, it's yours.

779
00:45:20,301 --> 00:45:22,543
I know you're excited about this, but...

780
00:45:24,597 --> 00:45:26,805
I just don't want you
to get your hopes up, you know?

781
00:45:26,891 --> 00:45:27,881
Yeah, I know.

782
00:45:32,230 --> 00:45:33,346
Is that a tape?

783
00:45:34,398 --> 00:45:35,809
- Be careful.
- I know.

784
00:45:37,944 --> 00:45:39,401
Okay.

785
00:45:39,487 --> 00:45:41,695
- That's Ashley's handwriting.
- Really?

786
00:45:51,999 --> 00:45:53,535
Holy shit.

787
00:45:58,839 --> 00:46:00,171
Hit play.

788
00:46:02,885 --> 00:46:04,547
I'm going to let you do this.

789
00:46:04,637 --> 00:46:05,923
All right, you ready?

790
00:46:06,847 --> 00:46:08,008
Ready.

791
00:46:20,987 --> 00:46:23,855
Soph? Sophie?

792
00:47:07,867 --> 00:47:08,732
Hi.

793
00:47:10,119 --> 00:47:12,361
Sophie Bishop.
I have an appointment with Captain Groves.

794
00:47:12,455 --> 00:47:13,696
IDs please.

795
00:47:30,639 --> 00:47:32,551
Just pull over to the side, ma'am.

796
00:47:32,641 --> 00:47:34,132
I need you to wait right over there.

797
00:47:34,226 --> 00:47:36,388
Okay. Is there a problem?
We should have an appointment.

798
00:47:36,479 --> 00:47:38,141
Yes ma'am.
I need you to wait right over there.

799
00:47:38,230 --> 00:47:39,516
Okay.

800
00:47:45,988 --> 00:47:47,479
What's it been, like an hour?

801
00:47:57,750 --> 00:47:59,582
That's him.

802
00:47:59,668 --> 00:48:03,628
Okay, uh, just stay here, keep it low.

803
00:48:06,175 --> 00:48:07,711
- Miss Bishop?
- Hi.

804
00:48:08,135 --> 00:48:09,216
Hi there.

805
00:48:14,767 --> 00:48:16,975
So we can do the interview
out here or in your office,

806
00:48:17,061 --> 00:48:18,518
whichever you prefer.

807
00:48:18,604 --> 00:48:19,845
It's not gonna happen.

808
00:48:24,527 --> 00:48:28,020
Okay, but... when we spoke on the phone,
you said that it was fine,

809
00:48:28,114 --> 00:48:31,403
so I guess I'm just wondering what
happened that made you change your mind.

810
00:48:31,492 --> 00:48:33,074
I understand.

811
00:48:35,788 --> 00:48:37,324
Did you watch the footage?

812
00:48:48,426 --> 00:48:49,542
Drive safe.

813
00:49:03,691 --> 00:49:04,898
You okay?

814
00:49:04,984 --> 00:49:07,271
Yeah, I just honestly wasn't expecting that.

815
00:49:07,361 --> 00:49:09,774
What did he say?

816
00:49:09,864 --> 00:49:12,072
He said, "Don't let that footage get out."

817
00:49:15,244 --> 00:49:16,701
What do you want to do?

818
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:22,411
What do you think Josh would do?

819
00:49:32,011 --> 00:49:33,343
This is gonna be rad.

820
00:49:35,473 --> 00:49:36,714
Dude.

821
00:49:37,766 --> 00:49:39,974
- Yeah.
- Look at its eye.

822
00:49:40,060 --> 00:49:41,847
- Yeah.
- This camera is amazing.

823
00:49:41,937 --> 00:49:44,145
- Yo, don't get too close.
- It smells burnt.

824
00:49:44,231 --> 00:49:46,314
It's like males competing for females.

825
00:49:48,194 --> 00:49:49,560
They have the same burns.

826
00:49:49,653 --> 00:49:51,440
Countless stories when UFOs
have been sighted about,

827
00:49:51,530 --> 00:49:53,362
like, animal experimentation.

828
00:49:53,449 --> 00:49:55,236
Uh-huh. Yeah, yeah.

829
00:49:55,326 --> 00:49:57,113
They just got cooked by the sun.

830
00:49:58,871 --> 00:50:01,238
- Woo!
- Oh shit.

831
00:50:05,044 --> 00:50:06,455
This way.

832
00:50:12,134 --> 00:50:16,303
- Obviously I'm joking.
- You just said you look like older Leo.

833
00:50:16,388 --> 00:50:18,550
People told me that
when Romeo and Juliet came out.

834
00:50:19,767 --> 00:50:20,883
What, they said that you...

835
00:50:20,976 --> 00:50:23,593
That literally made me
more popular in school.

836
00:50:23,687 --> 00:50:25,303
What are you guys talking about?

837
00:50:25,397 --> 00:50:27,810
- What?
- What are you guys talking about?

838
00:50:27,900 --> 00:50:29,562
You.

839
00:50:31,529 --> 00:50:33,862
Just at the top of that ridge.

840
00:50:33,948 --> 00:50:36,281
We wouldn't be able
to see anything from down here.

841
00:50:36,367 --> 00:50:38,324
Not like we're gonna see
anything up there, either.

842
00:50:38,410 --> 00:50:41,244
Don't be that guy.

843
00:50:42,122 --> 00:50:44,159
We don't need that guy.

844
00:50:44,250 --> 00:50:45,991
You remember where we parked the car, right?

845
00:50:46,085 --> 00:50:49,249
Uh... yeah. It's... that a-way.

846
00:50:50,548 --> 00:50:51,914
- Ooh, Josh.
- Oh shit.

847
00:50:53,050 --> 00:50:54,131
Come look at this.

848
00:50:55,052 --> 00:50:56,384
- What do you got?
- Whoa.

849
00:50:57,429 --> 00:50:58,385
Petroglyphs.

850
00:50:59,098 --> 00:51:00,009
Oh!

851
00:51:00,099 --> 00:51:01,806
Guess this means we're on the right track.

852
00:51:03,018 --> 00:51:04,884
Wow. Ancient graffiti.

853
00:51:10,067 --> 00:51:12,525
Now what you see below me
are Native American petroglyphs.

854
00:51:12,611 --> 00:51:15,274
They were probably put here
hundreds of years ago

855
00:51:15,364 --> 00:51:17,822
by the Apache.
They were native to these lands,

856
00:51:17,908 --> 00:51:20,446
very adept at living
in these mountainous regions.

857
00:51:20,536 --> 00:51:22,118
Uh...

858
00:51:22,204 --> 00:51:24,571
the spiral shape that you see below us...

859
00:51:24,665 --> 00:51:26,907
historians aren't quite sure
what it could have represented.

860
00:51:27,001 --> 00:51:29,084
It could have represented ripples in water,

861
00:51:29,169 --> 00:51:30,785
things that they saw in the sky.

862
00:51:32,172 --> 00:51:35,836
And... that's pretty much it. Petroglyphs.

863
00:51:38,470 --> 00:51:39,756
Please be careful.

864
00:51:46,645 --> 00:51:48,102
- You get that?
- Yeah.

865
00:51:48,188 --> 00:51:49,679
- It look steep?
- Yeah.

866
00:51:51,942 --> 00:51:53,183
You guys are idiots.

867
00:51:59,033 --> 00:52:01,195
Ah, I should not have smoked that cigarette.

868
00:52:07,166 --> 00:52:08,282
Whoa.

869
00:52:11,879 --> 00:52:14,337
How far do you want us to go, Josh?

870
00:52:14,423 --> 00:52:15,959
Just keep going.

871
00:52:38,947 --> 00:52:41,906
I'm wheezing. I'm out of breath.

872
00:52:46,789 --> 00:52:48,075
Whoa.

873
00:52:58,008 --> 00:52:59,215
- You rolling?
- Yeah.

874
00:52:59,301 --> 00:53:01,213
Check this out. Oh, shit.

875
00:53:04,139 --> 00:53:05,471
Where'd you get those?

876
00:53:05,557 --> 00:53:06,798
Ask Diane Sawyer over there.

877
00:53:06,892 --> 00:53:08,633
I got it from a guy at the gas station.

878
00:53:08,727 --> 00:53:10,935
Here. He had a crush on you or something.

879
00:53:11,021 --> 00:53:12,387
I just used my eyes.

880
00:53:14,024 --> 00:53:16,437
- Yeah. Dude, no, no. Do not film this.
- We have two more in here.

881
00:53:31,834 --> 00:53:33,416
Is Josh filming this?

882
00:53:33,502 --> 00:53:35,164
Whoa.

883
00:53:35,254 --> 00:53:38,543
Will you please be as careful as possible
with that on a cliff edge.

884
00:53:38,632 --> 00:53:40,544
Sorry.

885
00:53:40,634 --> 00:53:42,967
- Where's Mark?
- He's taking a leak.

886
00:53:43,053 --> 00:53:44,840
Oh, you didn't want to go with him?

887
00:53:44,930 --> 00:53:46,341
Shut up.

888
00:53:49,268 --> 00:53:51,430
- What are you doing?
- It's my turn to interview you.

889
00:53:51,520 --> 00:53:52,636
- This is...
- See how you like it.

890
00:53:52,730 --> 00:53:54,187
It's not a Hitchcock movie, you know.

891
00:53:54,273 --> 00:53:55,889
The director isn't in this one.

892
00:53:57,568 --> 00:53:59,230
You guys playing Truth or Dare up here?

893
00:54:00,487 --> 00:54:02,103
- Want to play Truth or Dare?
- Yeah.

894
00:54:02,197 --> 00:54:04,029
- You go first.
- You actually want to play?

895
00:54:04,575 --> 00:54:05,861
- Yeah, why not?
- Come on.

896
00:54:06,618 --> 00:54:08,655
- I've got a couple beers in me.
- Uh... dare.

897
00:54:09,830 --> 00:54:12,698
Okay. I dare you to tell the truth.

898
00:54:14,418 --> 00:54:16,250
That is not how you play the game.

899
00:54:16,336 --> 00:54:18,373
- It's fair enough.
- That is how I play the game.

900
00:54:18,464 --> 00:54:20,956
What's. uh... what's the deal
with you and Debbie Gomez?

901
00:54:23,844 --> 00:54:25,426
De-Debbie Gomez?

902
00:54:27,306 --> 00:54:28,342
Why?

903
00:54:29,767 --> 00:54:31,679
Well, the old rumor mill's been, you know...

904
00:54:32,728 --> 00:54:34,970
We hang out sometimes. Like, I don't...

905
00:54:35,063 --> 00:54:37,521
You guys play tennis or go golfing?

906
00:54:37,608 --> 00:54:39,975
Why are you being a dick, dude?
Like, we hang out.

907
00:54:40,068 --> 00:54:41,980
- Like, it's not...
- Why didn't you invite her here?

908
00:54:43,155 --> 00:54:44,817
I don't know. I didn't want to make it weird.

909
00:54:44,907 --> 00:54:46,239
What do you mean, "make it weird"?

910
00:54:46,325 --> 00:54:47,315
Why would that be weird?

911
00:54:47,409 --> 00:54:49,071
I didn't want to make it like a double date.

912
00:54:49,161 --> 00:54:50,777
- Wait, now that's weird.
- Oh, come on, man.

913
00:54:52,122 --> 00:54:54,364
All right, we cannot stay here forever.

914
00:54:54,458 --> 00:54:56,245
We need to go as soon as the sun dips down.

915
00:54:56,335 --> 00:54:58,292
Just hold on and enjoy it
for a second, please.

916
00:55:01,381 --> 00:55:03,543
I just want to get this. It's gorgeous.

917
00:55:09,097 --> 00:55:11,009
- Josh.
- What?

918
00:55:11,517 --> 00:55:13,133
- What is that?
- What?

919
00:55:13,227 --> 00:55:14,684
- What?
- That.

920
00:55:16,647 --> 00:55:18,183
No, no, what is that?

921
00:55:20,400 --> 00:55:21,732
- Ashley.
- Whoa, what?

922
00:55:23,403 --> 00:55:26,896
- Wait, Mark, isn't that... what?
- It's just kind of sitting there.

923
00:55:26,990 --> 00:55:28,856
Wait,
isn't the Luke Air Force Base over there?

924
00:55:28,951 --> 00:55:30,283
- Yeah.
- Maybe.

925
00:55:30,369 --> 00:55:32,156
Probably just something
from the Air Force Base.

926
00:55:33,705 --> 00:55:35,697
- Maybe a helicopter.
- You're the one looking for UFOs.

927
00:55:35,791 --> 00:55:38,124
- No, that's not a helicopter.
- I'm just pointing it out.

928
00:55:38,210 --> 00:55:39,667
We'd hear it if it was a helicopter.

929
00:55:39,753 --> 00:55:40,743
Hold on.

930
00:55:43,674 --> 00:55:45,757
- Wait. Okay, you guys.
- Think it's a fighter jet?

931
00:55:45,843 --> 00:55:48,301
- No, that's not a fighter jet.
- Don't get ahead of yourself.

932
00:55:48,387 --> 00:55:49,423
It's just a light.

933
00:55:49,513 --> 00:55:51,004
It's not. You'd hear it, you'd hear it.

934
00:55:53,267 --> 00:55:54,929
What? Oh, my God.

935
00:55:55,018 --> 00:55:57,180
Okay. Okay.

936
00:55:57,271 --> 00:55:58,682
Whoa!

937
00:56:00,274 --> 00:56:01,981
- Holy shit!
- What!

938
00:56:02,901 --> 00:56:04,233
Josh, did you get that?

939
00:56:04,903 --> 00:56:05,984
Hold on.

940
00:56:06,655 --> 00:56:07,896
Oh...

941
00:56:09,533 --> 00:56:11,399
- What was that?
- I don't...

942
00:56:11,493 --> 00:56:13,155
- wait, tell me you got that on camera.
- Yes!

943
00:56:13,245 --> 00:56:14,235
Can you play that back?

944
00:56:16,957 --> 00:56:18,914
- Oh, my God! Josh.
- Guys, stop, stop, stop.

945
00:56:19,001 --> 00:56:21,660
- Wait, Josh, seriously though.
- This is the greatest day of my life.

946
00:56:21,753 --> 00:56:23,460
Oh, my... did you know that was gonna happen?

947
00:56:23,547 --> 00:56:24,537
Here, give me that back.

948
00:56:24,631 --> 00:56:26,122
Did you know that was gonna happen?

949
00:56:26,216 --> 00:56:27,582
Is Luke Air Force Base that way?

950
00:56:28,719 --> 00:56:30,756
Luke Air Force Base is that way,
but that's not Air Force.

951
00:56:30,846 --> 00:56:32,587
- How do you know?
- You don't know that.

952
00:56:32,681 --> 00:56:34,513
Because it's not 2150.

953
00:56:37,227 --> 00:56:38,217
Come back.

954
00:56:38,312 --> 00:56:39,848
- All right, man.
- Twenty minutes.

955
00:56:39,938 --> 00:56:41,520
Get like a last pan or whatever. Let's go.

956
00:56:41,607 --> 00:56:43,018
Dude, come on. I'm happy for you, let's go.

957
00:56:43,108 --> 00:56:45,100
- Just ten more minutes?
- You've done that twice.

958
00:56:45,193 --> 00:56:46,604
Do you know how hard it's gonna be

959
00:56:46,695 --> 00:56:48,027
to walk through this canyon in the dark?

960
00:56:48,113 --> 00:56:49,570
I don't see what the problem is, okay?

961
00:56:49,656 --> 00:56:51,318
- You know the way back.
- It's already dark.

962
00:56:52,784 --> 00:56:55,117
The problem is that it starts
to get really dark and really cold,

963
00:56:55,203 --> 00:56:57,661
and she has a curfew,
and I still have to drive.

964
00:56:57,748 --> 00:56:59,284
- Please.
- Come on.

965
00:56:59,374 --> 00:57:00,410
Cut. We gotta go.

966
00:57:00,542 --> 00:57:01,623
All right, we're leaving.

967
00:57:02,794 --> 00:57:05,457
What if we get arrested by,
like, the Air Force or something?

968
00:57:05,547 --> 00:57:07,709
That would actually be
the scariest situation.

969
00:57:07,799 --> 00:57:11,467
Like our parents don't ever find out,
like, what's going to happen to us.

970
00:57:11,553 --> 00:57:13,385
The Air Force just takes us away
or something.

971
00:57:14,431 --> 00:57:15,797
That'd be so sad.

972
00:57:18,185 --> 00:57:20,552
My mom would think I was just
in my room playing with the camera.

973
00:57:20,646 --> 00:57:22,103
They wouldn't notice?

974
00:57:22,189 --> 00:57:24,146
They wouldn't... like, it would take
a couple years I think.

975
00:57:24,232 --> 00:57:25,689
My parents are noticing right now.

976
00:57:29,905 --> 00:57:31,112
Oh...

977
00:57:33,450 --> 00:57:35,487
You good?

978
00:57:35,577 --> 00:57:37,113
- Yeah.
- Mark.

979
00:57:37,204 --> 00:57:38,445
- Mark!
- Sorry.

980
00:57:41,333 --> 00:57:42,744
- Whoa.
- Give it to me.

981
00:57:42,834 --> 00:57:44,666
Give me that. Give me the UFO.

982
00:57:45,420 --> 00:57:46,331
Ah!

983
00:57:47,506 --> 00:57:49,372
After tonight, you can be producer,

984
00:57:49,466 --> 00:57:50,923
assistant director.

985
00:57:52,719 --> 00:57:54,802
You know what?
If you're lucky, we can talk "co."

986
00:57:54,888 --> 00:57:56,754
- We can what?
- We can talk "co."

987
00:57:56,848 --> 00:57:58,180
- All right.
- Co-director.

988
00:57:58,266 --> 00:58:00,303
He's three years older than me.

989
00:58:00,394 --> 00:58:02,056
His brother voted for Dole.

990
00:58:02,145 --> 00:58:03,511
- No, he didn't.
- Bob Dole? Really?

991
00:58:03,605 --> 00:58:05,141
Yes, he did. Your brother's a moron.

992
00:58:05,232 --> 00:58:08,145
My brother's... are you kidding me?
He's an... he's an engineering student.

993
00:58:09,945 --> 00:58:12,733
He's an engineering student.
He's actually very smart.

994
00:58:15,117 --> 00:58:16,449
He's gonna be president one day.

995
00:58:24,292 --> 00:58:27,330
- Is this a dead end?
- No, you gotta keep going through.

996
00:58:27,421 --> 00:58:28,832
Are you sure it's not a dead end?

997
00:58:28,922 --> 00:58:30,914
- I'm positive it's not a dead end.
- All right.

998
00:58:31,008 --> 00:58:32,465
We walked through here in the daytime.

999
00:58:32,551 --> 00:58:34,634
- Does it usually get this tight?
- Yeah.

1000
00:58:38,056 --> 00:58:39,888
We're good. It goes on for a while.

1001
00:58:39,975 --> 00:58:41,216
I'm gonna be in so much trouble.

1002
00:58:41,309 --> 00:58:43,346
- You guys need help?
- It's worth being in trouble.

1003
00:58:43,437 --> 00:58:44,803
Do you understand what we've seen today?

1004
00:58:44,896 --> 00:58:46,888
Yeah, but I can push it like
an hour, but any longer, it's...

1005
00:58:46,982 --> 00:58:48,939
We would've noticed these
on the way in for sure.

1006
00:58:49,026 --> 00:58:50,688
I don't remember these.

1007
00:58:50,777 --> 00:58:52,769
Yeah. I for sure would have noticed these.

1008
00:58:53,864 --> 00:58:54,900
Mark, are you sure we passed...

1009
00:58:56,783 --> 00:58:59,484
- Mark where are we going?
- Hold on, I'll be super sure, hold on.

1010
00:59:04,124 --> 00:59:05,660
Are you sure we're going the right way?

1011
00:59:05,751 --> 00:59:06,616
Yes!

1012
00:59:08,420 --> 00:59:10,252
Why can't you just use the stars, man?

1013
00:59:11,757 --> 00:59:13,248
- Josh.
- No, it's this way.

1014
00:59:15,135 --> 00:59:16,671
- Are you positive?
- Yep.

1015
00:59:16,762 --> 00:59:17,718
All right.

1016
00:59:19,014 --> 00:59:20,676
- Do you guys not hear that?
- What?

1017
00:59:25,687 --> 00:59:26,894
- What?
- Josh, come on.

1018
00:59:27,773 --> 00:59:30,015
- Everything just looks like rocks.
- I know where we are.

1019
00:59:30,108 --> 00:59:32,191
Yeah, but you keep going
left then right, then left then right.

1020
00:59:32,277 --> 00:59:34,109
You keep complaining
about us being late, so can we go?

1021
00:59:34,196 --> 00:59:35,653
I know exactly where we're going.

1022
00:59:35,739 --> 00:59:37,480
I mean, who else are we
gonna listen to anyway?

1023
00:59:38,658 --> 00:59:40,194
Okay, let's go. What way?

1024
00:59:41,453 --> 00:59:43,285
Hold on. Just stop moving. Let me...

1025
00:59:44,539 --> 00:59:45,746
look first.

1026
00:59:53,256 --> 00:59:54,497
Well...

1027
00:59:56,635 --> 00:59:58,467
- I definitely heard that.
- I just heard something.

1028
01:00:01,932 --> 01:00:03,468
Guys. Get down.

1029
01:00:04,643 --> 01:00:05,850
Get down.

1030
01:00:07,312 --> 01:00:08,644
Mark, get down.

1031
01:00:14,236 --> 01:00:16,023
- What is that?
- It could be a train.

1032
01:00:17,864 --> 01:00:20,572
I-I... I didn't see any tracks out here.

1033
01:00:22,786 --> 01:00:24,823
Shh. Just listen.

1034
01:00:43,723 --> 01:00:44,713
Okay, we're almost back.

1035
01:00:44,808 --> 01:00:46,800
- Let's get the hell out of here.
- Let's go.

1036
01:00:47,811 --> 01:00:50,474
- Everybody walk faster.
- Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey. It's okay.

1037
01:00:53,900 --> 01:00:56,187
- Ash, it's all right.
- We need to get out of here now.

1038
01:00:56,278 --> 01:00:57,940
I know. Just calm down.

1039
01:01:00,574 --> 01:01:02,281
Josh...

1040
01:01:02,367 --> 01:01:03,699
do you recognize any of this?

1041
01:01:05,745 --> 01:01:07,111
- Give me the compass.
- Do you want to try?

1042
01:01:07,205 --> 01:01:08,491
- Guys!
- Yes! Give me the compass.

1043
01:01:08,582 --> 01:01:09,618
Get us home.

1044
01:01:09,708 --> 01:01:11,574
- Okay, I will. I will!
- You do it.

1045
01:01:14,838 --> 01:01:17,922
Okay, so... we came from this way.

1046
01:01:20,635 --> 01:01:22,376
We got this way.

1047
01:01:22,470 --> 01:01:24,086
- It's definitely not this way.
- Mark?

1048
01:01:25,473 --> 01:01:28,557
- Mark, where you going?
- Just stay there.

1049
01:01:28,643 --> 01:01:31,226
- Mark, where you going?
- I'm gonna find the car from up here!

1050
01:01:31,313 --> 01:01:33,555
You're not gonna see anything
up there, it's pitch black.

1051
01:01:37,360 --> 01:01:39,272
Hey, Josh? Can you come look at this?

1052
01:01:40,572 --> 01:01:41,688
What?

1053
01:01:42,574 --> 01:01:44,110
It's just not working.

1054
01:01:44,201 --> 01:01:45,942
- Why would it do that?
- I don't know.

1055
01:01:46,036 --> 01:01:48,323
Whoa! What is that?

1056
01:01:50,957 --> 01:01:52,914
Oh, my God. What is that?

1057
01:01:55,587 --> 01:01:57,123
- Josh, I don't like this.
- Hold on, wait.

1058
01:01:57,214 --> 01:01:59,797
Just stay still. Where is it coming from?

1059
01:01:59,883 --> 01:02:01,044
I don't know.

1060
01:02:01,801 --> 01:02:02,962
- Oh!
- Ashley.

1061
01:02:03,053 --> 01:02:04,464
Oh, my God.

1062
01:02:07,432 --> 01:02:08,513
Oh, my God.

1063
01:02:11,853 --> 01:02:12,934
Josh.

1064
01:02:17,817 --> 01:02:20,059
Ashley, run! Run!

1065
01:02:22,948 --> 01:02:24,029
Oh, my God!

1066
01:02:25,617 --> 01:02:27,574
- Get down! Get down!
- Ow!

1067
01:02:28,370 --> 01:02:29,360
Run!

1068
01:02:40,131 --> 01:02:42,965
Jesus Christ! Whoa.

1069
01:02:43,051 --> 01:02:46,294
Holy shit. Oh, my God.

1070
01:02:48,348 --> 01:02:49,964
Oh, my God.

1071
01:02:55,855 --> 01:02:57,471
Josh? Josh?

1072
01:02:58,775 --> 01:03:00,391
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, you?

1073
01:03:01,069 --> 01:03:01,980
Yeah.

1074
01:03:03,154 --> 01:03:04,486
Your hands are shaking.

1075
01:03:05,657 --> 01:03:06,943
I'm scared.

1076
01:03:07,033 --> 01:03:09,366
- What was that?
- I don't know.

1077
01:03:12,956 --> 01:03:14,822
Oh, Mark! Are you all right?

1078
01:03:17,043 --> 01:03:18,579
Mark, tell me you saw that, man.

1079
01:03:19,504 --> 01:03:21,086
I saw the car.

1080
01:03:21,172 --> 01:03:22,708
- You saw the what?
- I saw the car. It's close.

1081
01:03:22,799 --> 01:03:23,835
You saw the car?

1082
01:03:23,925 --> 01:03:25,632
- What are you talking about?
- Come on.

1083
01:03:28,138 --> 01:03:29,970
- Mark, where are you going?
- I don't know.

1084
01:03:30,056 --> 01:03:31,763
Can we just get the hell out of here, please?

1085
01:03:31,850 --> 01:03:33,386
- No, wait!
- Mark!

1086
01:03:33,476 --> 01:03:34,887
- Mark!
- Let's go!

1087
01:03:34,978 --> 01:03:36,264
Okay, Mark, slow down!

1088
01:03:36,354 --> 01:03:37,890
- Tell me you saw that, man.
- Hey.

1089
01:03:37,981 --> 01:03:39,643
Can we just get the hell out of here, please?

1090
01:03:39,733 --> 01:03:41,440
I think we should have a group huddle first.

1091
01:03:41,526 --> 01:03:42,516
Mark, what was that?

1092
01:03:43,486 --> 01:03:44,522
Come on, man, what did you see?

1093
01:03:44,612 --> 01:03:46,444
Josh, I need you to stop talking
until we find the car.

1094
01:03:46,531 --> 01:03:48,067
Okay. You're sure the car's over here?

1095
01:03:48,158 --> 01:03:49,694
Yes, I'm positive the car's over here.

1096
01:03:49,784 --> 01:03:52,401
Can we please talk about what we got on tape?

1097
01:03:52,495 --> 01:03:53,611
Oh yes!

1098
01:03:53,705 --> 01:03:55,367
- I told you.
- The car!

1099
01:03:55,457 --> 01:03:57,073
Oh, oh!

1100
01:04:02,255 --> 01:04:03,496
Thank God.

1101
01:04:07,761 --> 01:04:09,844
We're not gonna see anything, Josh.

1102
01:04:12,474 --> 01:04:15,133
- Josh, get your ass in the car.
- Ah, come on, what if they come back?

1103
01:04:15,226 --> 01:04:16,762
I swear to God I'll leave you. Let's go.

1104
01:04:16,853 --> 01:04:18,890
- Just five minutes, man.
- Come on. Get in the car.

1105
01:04:22,275 --> 01:04:24,437
You really didn't see anything?

1106
01:04:24,527 --> 01:04:26,644
I thought I did. I thought I saw these, um...

1107
01:04:26,738 --> 01:04:30,231
- Like circles?
- No, dumbass. Like rings.

1108
01:04:30,325 --> 01:04:31,907
And they were above me,
and then they were gone.

1109
01:04:31,993 --> 01:04:33,404
Wait, rings like the petroglyphs?

1110
01:04:34,871 --> 01:04:36,203
Did you guys not see these?

1111
01:04:38,958 --> 01:04:41,575
All right, it was obviously
in my head, all right? Let's just go.

1112
01:04:46,257 --> 01:04:48,590
Oh shit. Oh shit.

1113
01:04:48,676 --> 01:04:50,793
There we go.

1114
01:04:50,887 --> 01:04:52,173
Oh, thank God.

1115
01:04:54,182 --> 01:04:57,141
You guys, what the hell just happened to us?

1116
01:04:57,227 --> 01:04:59,594
No one has ever filmed
anything like that before.

1117
01:05:00,647 --> 01:05:01,728
Let's just get out of here.

1118
01:05:03,149 --> 01:05:05,857
Signs of civilization.

1119
01:05:05,944 --> 01:05:09,483
I know. It feels so nice to listen to music.

1120
01:05:10,240 --> 01:05:11,731
You're gonna be real famous, Josh.

1121
01:05:11,825 --> 01:05:13,361
- I think he will be.
- Thank you.

1122
01:05:13,451 --> 01:05:15,238
Yeah, until they think it's all faked.

1123
01:05:23,461 --> 01:05:25,293
- Are you okay, Mark?
- Yeah.

1124
01:05:26,714 --> 01:05:28,546
- Are you sure?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

1125
01:05:28,633 --> 01:05:30,625
Your head feels a little bit hot.

1126
01:05:30,718 --> 01:05:32,880
Yeah, I have a stomachache, but I'm good.

1127
01:05:35,890 --> 01:05:39,304
I think Mark's gonna be the most famous
when people see how bad he pissed his pants.

1128
01:05:39,394 --> 01:05:41,431
Dude, shut up. Are you serious?

1129
01:05:41,521 --> 01:05:43,854
- Mark, you were really scared.
- I would have loved to see

1130
01:05:43,940 --> 01:05:46,808
- either of you up there by yourselves.
- You should have seen your face.

1131
01:05:46,901 --> 01:05:48,233
Okay.

1132
01:05:49,904 --> 01:05:51,145
What's up with the radio?

1133
01:05:57,954 --> 01:06:00,321
- I have to drive for two hours.
- All right, all right, all right.

1134
01:06:00,415 --> 01:06:01,906
And we're done shooting.

1135
01:06:04,461 --> 01:06:06,248
Whoa, whoa, what is that?

1136
01:06:06,337 --> 01:06:08,545
- What?
- Is that a car?

1137
01:06:08,631 --> 01:06:10,998
- What is that?
- What the hell is that?

1138
01:06:12,343 --> 01:06:13,424
It's just a car.

1139
01:06:13,511 --> 01:06:14,968
No, no, no, there's no way on earth.

1140
01:06:15,054 --> 01:06:17,091
Josh, cars don't have one light.
What is that?

1141
01:06:17,182 --> 01:06:18,718
Is it getting clo... turn that off.

1142
01:06:18,808 --> 01:06:20,094
Sorry.

1143
01:06:20,185 --> 01:06:22,268
- Okay, Mark, speed up. Go, go, go, go, go.
- I am.

1144
01:06:22,353 --> 01:06:24,390
Josh, is it getting closer?

1145
01:06:24,481 --> 01:06:26,063
Yeah, it's getting closer, I can see it.

1146
01:06:27,775 --> 01:06:29,141
- Oh, my God.
- What the hell is that?

1147
01:06:29,235 --> 01:06:30,646
Josh, it's not a car! Josh, it's not a car!

1148
01:06:30,737 --> 01:06:32,353
Josh, what's it doing? What's it doing?

1149
01:06:32,447 --> 01:06:34,609
- Is it getting closer?
- Oh, my God, it's right behind us!

1150
01:06:35,283 --> 01:06:36,819
Mark, speed up! Go, go, go, go, go!

1151
01:06:36,910 --> 01:06:38,367
I'm going as fast as I can!

1152
01:06:41,122 --> 01:06:42,988
- Don't stop, dude!
- My car just died!

1153
01:06:43,082 --> 01:06:45,244
- Oh, my God. I don't like this!
- What just happened?

1154
01:06:45,335 --> 01:06:47,042
What just happened? The car isn't going.

1155
01:06:47,128 --> 01:06:48,960
The car isn't going.
What the hell just happened?

1156
01:06:49,047 --> 01:06:50,083
Josh. Josh.

1157
01:06:50,173 --> 01:06:51,755
- What the heck!
- Okay, stop.

1158
01:07:00,391 --> 01:07:03,930
Uh, everything was fine with the car,
and now... it's not.

1159
01:07:04,020 --> 01:07:05,511
The engine doesn't have power.

1160
01:07:05,605 --> 01:07:07,517
The whole car in general doesn't have power.

1161
01:07:10,485 --> 01:07:11,817
Ah.

1162
01:07:12,946 --> 01:07:14,312
My mouth tastes weird.

1163
01:07:15,198 --> 01:07:18,657
Adrenaline. It's why your mouth tastes weird.

1164
01:07:21,704 --> 01:07:23,115
No water.

1165
01:07:26,960 --> 01:07:28,451
Yo, Josh, come help me.

1166
01:07:28,545 --> 01:07:29,752
Cool.

1167
01:07:30,838 --> 01:07:32,830
Ash, put the E-brake up.

1168
01:07:34,551 --> 01:07:37,840
There we go. You ready? Let's go.

1169
01:07:42,976 --> 01:07:44,558
What the hell is going on, man?

1170
01:07:44,644 --> 01:07:46,010
I don't know, man.

1171
01:07:47,272 --> 01:07:48,604
All right, that's good, Ash.

1172
01:07:55,613 --> 01:07:57,400
- Mark?
- Yeah?

1173
01:07:58,408 --> 01:07:59,524
Hey, man, you all right?

1174
01:08:01,452 --> 01:08:03,614
- Yeah.
- Dude. Dude, your nose is bleeding.

1175
01:08:03,705 --> 01:08:04,741
What's going on?

1176
01:08:06,708 --> 01:08:09,041
- What happened?
- I just have a nose bleed.

1177
01:08:10,128 --> 01:08:11,335
- What?
- I'm fine.

1178
01:08:11,421 --> 01:08:12,457
- You okay?
- Yeah.

1179
01:08:12,547 --> 01:08:14,539
I used to get 'em all the time
when I was a kid. Stop.

1180
01:08:14,632 --> 01:08:16,464
- Oh, my God.
- It is the dry air.

1181
01:08:16,551 --> 01:08:18,213
- You're sweating.
- I'm fine.

1182
01:08:19,846 --> 01:08:20,927
- Is it any better?
- Oh.

1183
01:08:22,223 --> 01:08:23,464
Here.

1184
01:08:25,393 --> 01:08:27,009
How far do you think the gas station is?

1185
01:08:28,062 --> 01:08:30,600
- Mark?
- Uh, seven, eight miles.

1186
01:08:31,357 --> 01:08:32,393
In the dark?

1187
01:08:33,151 --> 01:08:35,438
We should stay with the car,
we're not doing that. That's crazy.

1188
01:08:35,528 --> 01:08:37,941
Yeah, we are. No, honest,
it'll take a couple hours,

1189
01:08:38,031 --> 01:08:39,442
it'll be open, we'll get some help.

1190
01:08:39,532 --> 01:08:41,945
- Let's go. Josh?
- Come on.

1191
01:08:42,702 --> 01:08:44,193
Ashley, this is crazy.

1192
01:08:48,750 --> 01:08:49,661
Shoot.

1193
01:08:54,631 --> 01:08:56,167
- You all right?
- Huh?

1194
01:08:56,799 --> 01:08:58,006
You cool?

1195
01:08:58,092 --> 01:08:59,253
- You all right?
- Hey, guys.

1196
01:08:59,344 --> 01:09:00,505
- Yeah.
- Come on.

1197
01:09:11,981 --> 01:09:13,222
You guys, it's getting cold.

1198
01:09:23,910 --> 01:09:25,026
Hey, Ash?

1199
01:09:26,371 --> 01:09:28,988
Hey, Ash? Let's let Mark catch up.

1200
01:09:31,542 --> 01:09:34,159
Something's wrong with him, Josh.

1201
01:09:34,253 --> 01:09:37,212
- It's, uh, just a nose bleed.
- No.

1202
01:09:37,298 --> 01:09:38,960
It's not just a nose bleed.

1203
01:09:40,385 --> 01:09:43,549
I mean, something happened to him up there.

1204
01:09:43,638 --> 01:09:46,676
It's not just a coincidence, the car dying
right when the lights came back.

1205
01:09:49,852 --> 01:09:52,515
So what are you saying?
They're messing with us?

1206
01:09:55,358 --> 01:09:57,315
They're following us.

1207
01:09:57,402 --> 01:09:58,392
Guys!

1208
01:10:03,032 --> 01:10:04,022
Do you hear that?

1209
01:10:06,411 --> 01:10:08,698
- Did you hear that?
- Hear what?

1210
01:10:09,747 --> 01:10:10,908
Come here.

1211
01:10:12,125 --> 01:10:13,457
Mark, come on.

1212
01:10:15,712 --> 01:10:17,044
No, someone's out there.

1213
01:10:21,092 --> 01:10:22,378
Hey!

1214
01:10:22,468 --> 01:10:25,176
- Mark!
- Come... come here! Come help us!

1215
01:10:25,263 --> 01:10:26,720
Dude, come on!

1216
01:10:28,725 --> 01:10:30,432
Come help us!

1217
01:10:30,518 --> 01:10:32,510
- What is he talking about?
- Dan, I can hear you.

1218
01:10:32,603 --> 01:10:33,468
- Mark!
- Mark!

1219
01:10:33,563 --> 01:10:34,599
Shh.

1220
01:10:35,982 --> 01:10:38,474
Dan! Thank God!

1221
01:10:38,568 --> 01:10:40,730
- What? Do you hear anything?
- Guys, it's my brother!

1222
01:10:40,820 --> 01:10:42,231
How did you find us?

1223
01:10:42,321 --> 01:10:43,778
What the hell is he talking about?

1224
01:10:43,865 --> 01:10:46,152
- Mark! Come on!
- Mark!

1225
01:10:46,242 --> 01:10:47,699
JOSH! Mark, come on!

1226
01:10:50,079 --> 01:10:51,741
Whoa! Jesus! Ashley!

1227
01:10:51,831 --> 01:10:52,912
Mark!

1228
01:11:01,716 --> 01:11:02,877
What was that?

1229
01:11:02,967 --> 01:11:04,048
I don't know.

1230
01:11:09,807 --> 01:11:12,515
Ow! Ah! Ah!

1231
01:11:36,751 --> 01:11:39,289
- Mark!
- Mark! What the hell?

1232
01:11:41,589 --> 01:11:42,830
Mark!

1233
01:11:46,093 --> 01:11:48,927
Hey, Mark! I can't see his headlamp.

1234
01:11:50,556 --> 01:11:51,467
Mark?

1235
01:11:54,185 --> 01:11:55,346
Come on, man.

1236
01:12:00,900 --> 01:12:01,890
Hold on.

1237
01:12:03,736 --> 01:12:06,604
- Did you hear anything?
- No.

1238
01:12:06,697 --> 01:12:08,108
'Cause Mark said he heard voices.

1239
01:12:08,199 --> 01:12:09,986
What voices, Josh? There's no one out here.

1240
01:12:10,827 --> 01:12:13,319
Let's just find Mark. Hey, Mark!

1241
01:12:13,412 --> 01:12:15,199
He looked so sick. Mark?

1242
01:12:15,289 --> 01:12:16,746
How much further could he have gone?

1243
01:12:16,833 --> 01:12:18,995
- I don't... I don't know.
- Mark!

1244
01:12:20,169 --> 01:12:21,159
Mark!

1245
01:12:23,005 --> 01:12:24,667
Oh, God.

1246
01:12:24,757 --> 01:12:26,840
We're not going anywhere until we find Mark.

1247
01:12:26,926 --> 01:12:28,007
Mark!

1248
01:12:28,094 --> 01:12:29,710
- Ashley.
- No, we're gonna find him.

1249
01:12:29,804 --> 01:12:30,965
Ashley.

1250
01:12:31,055 --> 01:12:32,796
Mark!

1251
01:12:33,516 --> 01:12:34,802
Mark!

1252
01:12:34,892 --> 01:12:37,680
- He's gone.
- He's not gone.

1253
01:12:37,770 --> 01:12:40,012
He's not gone. He's just...

1254
01:12:40,106 --> 01:12:43,975
he's just lost. He's just lost, okay?

1255
01:12:44,068 --> 01:12:46,025
What are you talking about?

1256
01:12:46,112 --> 01:12:47,853
He was there, and then he was gone.

1257
01:12:47,947 --> 01:12:50,781
Something took him. They took him.

1258
01:12:50,867 --> 01:12:52,699
No. No one took him.

1259
01:12:52,785 --> 01:12:55,448
He's probably behind
one of these hills. Okay?

1260
01:12:55,538 --> 01:12:59,122
But we... we've gotta keep moving.

1261
01:12:59,208 --> 01:13:01,746
We've gotta keep moving,
we've gotta find people.

1262
01:13:01,836 --> 01:13:04,249
We can come back and help Mark, all right?
So come on.

1263
01:13:05,882 --> 01:13:08,215
Come on. Please.

1264
01:13:10,511 --> 01:13:12,548
- Okay.
- All right, all right.

1265
01:13:13,306 --> 01:13:14,387
Okay.

1266
01:13:17,143 --> 01:13:20,762
All right. I'm okay. I'm okay.

1267
01:13:23,482 --> 01:13:25,599
Listen...

1268
01:13:25,693 --> 01:13:28,811
don't worry about him anyway.
Okay? He's been in...

1269
01:13:28,905 --> 01:13:32,990
the Boy Scouts
since he was like two years old.

1270
01:13:33,075 --> 01:13:35,112
- Mark!
- And he's go...

1271
01:13:36,245 --> 01:13:37,702
Holy shit!

1272
01:13:37,788 --> 01:13:40,576
- What? What is it?
- Look! Look, it's a light!

1273
01:13:42,251 --> 01:13:44,493
- Is it them?
- No!

1274
01:13:44,587 --> 01:13:47,421
That's like... like a street light
or a trailer or something.

1275
01:13:49,592 --> 01:13:50,673
I told you.

1276
01:13:51,928 --> 01:13:54,215
Okay. Let's go.

1277
01:13:56,390 --> 01:13:58,803
We can get some water. Call for help.

1278
01:14:02,647 --> 01:14:04,354
Let's go. Yeah.

1279
01:14:08,694 --> 01:14:11,061
- Are you still filming?
- Yeah.

1280
01:14:12,156 --> 01:14:15,149
I'm trying to film landmarks
so we can retrace our steps.

1281
01:14:16,118 --> 01:14:16,983
That's smart.

1282
01:14:19,622 --> 01:14:21,204
I think I just need a second to rest.

1283
01:14:23,751 --> 01:14:25,083
We're gonna be okay.

1284
01:14:25,169 --> 01:14:26,876
We're gonna find him, Josh.

1285
01:14:26,963 --> 01:14:28,170
Yeah.

1286
01:14:38,391 --> 01:14:39,472
- Shit!
- What?

1287
01:14:40,851 --> 01:14:43,093
Damn it! I just dropped my flashlight.

1288
01:14:43,187 --> 01:14:44,849
Okay, where is it?

1289
01:14:44,939 --> 01:14:46,805
No, there's no way we can get it. Look down.

1290
01:14:47,566 --> 01:14:49,228
Shit!

1291
01:14:49,318 --> 01:14:51,731
Okay, we're gonna use this as a flashlight.

1292
01:14:53,864 --> 01:14:55,605
Okay, just flash it
in front of me, all right.

1293
01:14:55,700 --> 01:14:57,236
- Okay.
- Don't drop it.

1294
01:14:57,326 --> 01:14:58,487
- All right.
- Okay, let's go.

1295
01:14:58,577 --> 01:15:01,820
Whoa. How long does this battery last?

1296
01:15:01,914 --> 01:15:03,496
About an hour.

1297
01:15:03,582 --> 01:15:04,948
Oh, shit.

1298
01:15:07,003 --> 01:15:08,039
Is it bright enough?

1299
01:15:08,713 --> 01:15:10,579
Yeah, it's okay.

1300
01:15:11,799 --> 01:15:13,335
We're almost down.

1301
01:15:15,469 --> 01:15:17,586
Josh?

1302
01:15:17,680 --> 01:15:18,887
What?

1303
01:15:20,182 --> 01:15:21,798
God. Oh, my God.

1304
01:15:23,310 --> 01:15:25,518
I have t... I have tissues.

1305
01:15:25,604 --> 01:15:27,937
Get 'em. Where's... where's...

1306
01:15:28,024 --> 01:15:29,811
- It's in my front pocket.
- The front pocket?

1307
01:15:32,153 --> 01:15:34,486
Here. Here. Here.

1308
01:15:35,322 --> 01:15:36,483
Okay.

1309
01:15:38,242 --> 01:15:39,858
I shouldn't have brought you guys out here.

1310
01:15:41,746 --> 01:15:44,784
It's not your fault. I wanted to come.

1311
01:15:45,541 --> 01:15:46,452
Why?

1312
01:15:47,626 --> 01:15:48,912
I don't know.

1313
01:15:52,131 --> 01:15:53,588
I just wanted to do something different.

1314
01:15:54,842 --> 01:15:56,049
Something unexpected.

1315
01:15:59,555 --> 01:16:01,968
Something my dad wouldn't expect, anyway.

1316
01:16:04,894 --> 01:16:05,930
I'm good.

1317
01:16:06,437 --> 01:16:07,644
- You sure?
- Yeah, I'm good.

1318
01:16:08,981 --> 01:16:10,188
I'm good. Come on.

1319
01:16:24,747 --> 01:16:27,160
Shit. Ashley?

1320
01:16:31,754 --> 01:16:33,086
Shit.

1321
01:16:38,094 --> 01:16:39,426
Let's go.

1322
01:16:40,221 --> 01:16:41,177
Okay.

1323
01:16:46,727 --> 01:16:48,263
Oh, God.

1324
01:16:50,731 --> 01:16:52,643
- Josh.
- Hey.

1325
01:16:52,733 --> 01:16:54,065
Hey, we can't go back.

1326
01:16:56,320 --> 01:16:58,107
Come on. Just don't look at 'em.

1327
01:17:01,492 --> 01:17:02,983
- Shit.
- They're burned.

1328
01:17:04,411 --> 01:17:05,697
They burned them.

1329
01:17:18,050 --> 01:17:19,257
Ah!

1330
01:17:23,347 --> 01:17:24,428
Ashley?

1331
01:17:27,143 --> 01:17:28,133
Josh?

1332
01:17:28,853 --> 01:17:31,641
It's okay. It's okay. It's okay.

1333
01:17:31,730 --> 01:17:32,720
It's okay.

1334
01:17:41,031 --> 01:17:43,318
- Do you hear that?
- Hear what?

1335
01:17:46,328 --> 01:17:47,318
Do you hear that?

1336
01:17:54,753 --> 01:17:55,743
Ashley?

1337
01:17:58,507 --> 01:17:59,497
Ashley?

1338
01:18:01,010 --> 01:18:02,296
You don't hear that?

1339
01:18:08,767 --> 01:18:09,757
Ashley?

1340
01:18:10,352 --> 01:18:12,093
- It's my dad.
- Ashley?

1341
01:18:12,188 --> 01:18:13,224
Oh!

1342
01:18:13,314 --> 01:18:15,522
- It's my dad!
- Oh, my... Oh, my God!

1343
01:18:16,317 --> 01:18:18,525
- Ashley!
- Dad!

1344
01:18:19,612 --> 01:18:21,774
- Dad!
- Oh!

1345
01:18:23,032 --> 01:18:25,069
I'm right here!

1346
01:18:25,159 --> 01:18:27,902
- Ashley, stop!
- Dad, I'm here!

1347
01:18:29,538 --> 01:18:31,575
I'm right here!

1348
01:18:32,082 --> 01:18:34,745
- Dad, I'm here!
- Ashley, don't!

1349
01:18:36,795 --> 01:18:39,458
It's my dad! It's my dad!

1350
01:18:40,674 --> 01:18:42,040
Dad!

1351
01:18:45,638 --> 01:18:47,470
Ashley, stop!

1352
01:18:48,515 --> 01:18:49,881
Dad!

1353
01:19:04,323 --> 01:19:05,609
Hello!
