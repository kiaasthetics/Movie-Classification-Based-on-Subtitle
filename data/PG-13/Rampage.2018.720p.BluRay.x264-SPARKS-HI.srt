You've engaged the gorilla, sir?

898
00:57:07,920 --> 00:57:08,960
And the wolf.

899
00:57:09,040 --> 00:57:12,010
Got them surrounded in a quarry
about 30 miles outside Chicago.

900
00:57:12,160 --> 00:57:15,369
Their trajectories had them both going
in a straight line to the city.

901

a coordinated long-distance journey.

Excuse me. Who is this?

904
00:57:20,800 --> 00:57:22,564
Colonel, this is Davis Okoye.

905
00:57:22,720 --> 00:57:25,087
He's a primatologist.
He raised the gorilla there.

906
00:57:25,240 --> 00:57:27,561
And that is Dr. Caldwell.
She worked for Energyne.

907
00:57:28,080 --> 00:57:30,162
She helped cook up our cuddly little friends.

908

Agent Russell, this is a military operation.

909
00:57:32,240 --> 00:57:35,767
Yes, sir. I understand that, sir.
But right now,

910
00:57:35,920 --> 00:57:39,003
these two know more about these
creatures than anyone on this planet.

911
00:57:39,160 --> 00:57:41,367
I think you need to hear
what they have to say.

912
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:44,128
DAVIS: Colonel, what everybody has to
understand is

913
00:57:44,280 --> 00:57:46,169
this is no longer just a wolf and a gorilla.

914
00:57:46,800 --> 00:57:48,643
A wolf and a gorilla would be attacking
each other.

915
00:57:48,800 --> 00:57:51,963
They wouldn't be traveling in
a straight line to the same destination.

916
00:57:52,120 --> 00:57:54,043
Then what are they doing
and why are they going to Chicago?

917
00:57:54,240 --> 00:57:55,844
Because they're being called.

918
00:57:56,240 --> 00:57:58,891
When I was at Energyne,
we worked with bat DNA.

919
00:57:59,040 --> 00:58:02,283
The Wydens were obsessed with developing
biosonar communication

920
00:58:02,440 --> 00:58:04,886
and it looks like they got it to work.

921
00:58:05,080 --> 00:58:08,368
Energyne must be emitting some kind of
signal to draw them there.

922
00:58:08,520 --> 00:58:11,046
Those creatures will do anything

923
00:58:11,200 --> 00:58:13,442
to get to that signal and make it stop.

924
00:58:14,600 --> 00:58:16,842
Colonel, you have to evacuate Chicago.

925
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:18,843

926
