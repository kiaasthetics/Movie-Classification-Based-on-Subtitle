1
00:01:56,445 --> 00:01:58,789
Thirteen meters. You should see it.

2
00:02:12,127 --> 00:02:13,845
Okay, take her up and over the bow rail.

3
00:02:16,298 --> 00:02:19,643
Mir 2, we're going over
the bow. Stay with us.

4
00:02:53,668 --> 00:02:55,841
Okay, quiet. We're rolling.

5
00:02:56,296 --> 00:02:59,641
Seeing her coming out of the
darkness like a ghost ship...

6
00:02:59,883 --> 00:03:01,556
still gets me every time.

7
00:03:03,303 --> 00:03:07,149
To see the sad ruin of the
great ship sitting here...

8
00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:09,814
where she landed at 2:30 in the morning

9
00:03:10,018 --> 00:03:12,020
Of April 15, 1912...

10
00:03:12,479 --> 00:03:14,652
after her long fall...

11
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:17,442
from the world above.

12
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:19,532
You are so full of shit, boss.

13
00:03:50,058 --> 00:03:53,733
Dive 6. Here we are again on the deck of Titanic.

14
00:03:54,187 --> 00:03:58,033
Two and a half miles down. 3,821 meters-

15
00:03:58,358 --> 00:04:03,364
The pressure outside is
three and a half tons per square inch

16
00:04:04,197 --> 00:04:05,870
These windows are nine inches thick.

17
00:04:06,116 --> 00:04:09,791
If they go, it's sayonara in two microseconds.

18
00:04:10,328 --> 00:04:12,751
All right, enough of that bullshit.

19
00:04:26,678 --> 00:04:30,103
Just put her down on the roof of
the officers' quarters like yesterday

20
00:04:31,558 --> 00:04:36,064
Mir 2, we're landing right over the
Grand Staircase. You guys set to launch?

21
00:04:36,396 --> 00:04:39,821
Yeah, Brock. Launching Dunkin now. Go, Charlie.

22
00:04:47,908 --> 00:04:49,751
- All right, tether out.
- Tether out.

23
00:04:50,619 --> 00:04:53,623
Okay, Brock, we're dropping
down along the hull.

24
00:04:56,249 --> 00:05:00,254
Yeah, roger that. Okay, drop down and
go into the first-class gangway door.

25
00:05:00,587 --> 00:05:02,180
I want you guys working the D deck...

26
00:05:02,422 --> 00:05:04,800
reception area and the dining saloon.

27
00:05:05,592 --> 00:05:06,593
Copy that.

28
00:05:12,807 --> 00:05:15,971
Tether out. Okay, now left.
Left, left. Okay, coming left.

29
00:05:24,986 --> 00:05:28,832
Snoop Dog is on the move.
We're headed down the stairwell.

30
00:05:31,576 --> 00:05:33,419
Okay Lewis, drop down to B deck.

31
00:05:33,912 --> 00:05:36,256
- Okay, A deck-
- Give me some rope, Captain

32
00:05:36,580 --> 00:05:38,083
B deck. Get in there. Get in there.

33
00:06:16,870 --> 00:06:18,714
Watch the door frame.

34
00:06:18,957 --> 00:06:20,520
- Watch it, watch it.
- I see it. I got it.

35
00:06:26,530 --> 00:06:27,974
- We good? Bring her down.
- We're good. Just chill, boss.

36
00:06:42,397 --> 00:06:44,570
Okay, make your turn

37
00:06:45,066 --> 00:06:47,319
- Cable out, Captain.
- Make your turn. Watch the wall.

38
00:06:47,610 --> 00:06:49,954
Yeah Brock, we're at the piano. You copy?

39
00:06:50,572 --> 00:06:52,074
Okay, copy that.

40
00:06:59,456 --> 00:07:01,675
Okay, right there. Right there.

41
00:07:01,958 --> 00:07:03,460
Okay, that's it, that's it.
That's the bedroom door.

42
00:07:03,710 --> 00:07:05,053
I see it. I see it.

43
00:07:14,137 --> 00:07:15,229
We're in!

44
00:07:15,472 --> 00:07:17,520
We're in, baby. We're there.

45
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:20,820
That's Hockley's bed.

46
00:07:20,830 --> 00:07:22,938
That's where the son of a bitch slept.

47
00:07:29,027 --> 00:07:31,450
Oops. Somebody left the water running.

48
00:07:31,780 --> 00:07:34,203
Hold it. Hold it just a second.
Go back to the right.

49
00:07:40,830 --> 00:07:43,128
That wardrobe door. Get closer.

50
00:07:43,540 --> 00:07:44,884
You smelling something, boss?

51
00:07:45,376 --> 00:07:48,300
- I want to see what's under it.
- Give me my hands, man.

52
00:07:54,219 --> 00:07:55,311
All right.

53
00:07:56,970 --> 00:07:58,894
- Take it easy. It might come apart.
- Okay.

54
00:08:00,892 --> 00:08:03,566
Go, go, go. Flip it over. Flip it over. Go.

55
00:08:04,395 --> 00:08:05,520
Tum her over. Keep going.

56
00:08:05,530 --> 00:08:06,899
Go, go.

57
00:08:07,232 --> 00:08:08,324
Okay, drop it.

58
00:08:17,575 --> 00:08:20,670
Oh, baby, baby. Are you seeing this, boss?

59
00:08:23,580 --> 00:08:25,583
It's payday, boys.

60
00:08:41,390 --> 00:08:43,064
Cha-ching!

61
00:08:43,935 --> 00:08:45,778
- We did it, Bobby.
- We brought it back, Baby.

62
00:08:46,104 --> 00:08:49,108
Oh, yeah! Who's the best? Who's the best, baby?

63
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:51,442
Say it. Say it. Say it.

64
00:08:51,776 --> 00:08:53,449
You are, Lewis.

65
00:08:56,030 --> 00:08:57,031
- Bobby, my cigar.
- Right here.

66
00:09:05,957 --> 00:09:06,958
Okay, crack her open.

67
00:09:37,070 --> 00:09:38,072
Shit.

68
00:09:40,325 --> 00:09:41,827
No diamond.

69
00:09:43,870 --> 00:09:47,591
You know boss, this same thing happened
to Geraldo and his career never recovered.

70
00:09:51,669 --> 00:09:53,012
Turn the camera off.

71
00:09:53,338 --> 00:09:55,841
Brock, the partners would like
to know how it's going.

72
00:09:57,342 --> 00:10:01,347
Hey, Dave, Barry, hi. Look, it wasn't
in the safe. But hey, hey...

73
00:10:01,679 --> 00:10:05,183
Don't worry about it. There's still
plenty of places it could be. Hell, yes.

74
00:10:05,683 --> 00:10:07,970
The floor debris in the suite, the mother's room,

75
00:10:07,980 --> 00:10:09,069
the purser's safe on C deck.

76
00:10:09,354 --> 00:10:10,446
Jimmy Hoffa's briefcase.

77
00:10:10,688 --> 00:10:15,535
A dozen other places. Guys, look, you're just going
to have to trust my instincts. I know we're close

78
00:10:15,777 --> 00:10:18,121
We've just got to go through
a little process of elimination.

79
00:10:19,530 --> 00:10:21,203
Hang on a second.

80
00:10:24,369 --> 00:10:26,121
- Let me see that.
- Ah, we may have something here, guys.

81
00:10:29,874 --> 00:10:31,690
Where's the photograph of the necklace?

82
00:10:31,700 --> 00:10:32,710
We'll call you right back.

83
00:10:44,722 --> 00:10:46,565
I'll be goddamned.

84
00:10:49,477 --> 00:10:52,981
Treasure hunter Brock Lovett
is best known for finding Spanish gold

85
00:10:53,230 --> 00:10:54,904
It's okay. I'll feed you in a minute.

86
00:10:55,233 --> 00:11:00,239
Now he has chartered Russian subs to reach
the most famous shipwreck of all, the Titanic.

87
00:11:00,570 --> 00:11:04,417
He is with us live via satellite
from the research ship Keldysh...

88
00:11:04,659 --> 00:11:06,832
in the North Atlantic. Hello, Brock.

89
00:11:07,078 --> 00:11:11,083
Hello, Tracy. Of course, everyone knows
the familiar stories of Titanic.

90
00:11:11,332 --> 00:11:14,336
You know, the nobility of the band
playing to the very end and all that.

91
00:11:14,585 --> 00:11:19,091
But what I'm interested in are the untold stories.
The secrets locked deep inside the hull of Titanic.

92
00:11:19,340 --> 00:11:23,345
And we're out here using robot
technology to go further into the wreck...

93
00:11:23,594 --> 00:11:25,267
than anybody has ever done before.

94
00:11:25,596 --> 00:11:28,770
Your expedition is at the center
of a storm of controversy...

95
00:11:29,017 --> 00:11:33,022
over salvage rights and even ethics.
Many are calling you a graverobber

96
00:11:33,270 --> 00:11:35,114
Well, nobody ever called the
recovery of the artifacts...

97
00:11:35,356 --> 00:11:36,357
What is it?

98
00:11:36,607 --> 00:11:38,280
Tum that up, dear.

99
00:11:38,609 --> 00:11:41,283
I have museum-trained experts
sent out here making sure...

100
00:11:41,529 --> 00:11:44,320
that these relics are preserved
and catalogued properly.

101
00:11:44,330 --> 00:11:47,209
Take a look at this drawing
that we found just today.

102
00:11:47,452 --> 00:11:50,956
A piece of paper that's been
underwater for eighty-four years.

103
00:11:51,289 --> 00:11:53,792
And my team are able to preserve it intact.

104
00:11:54,292 --> 00:11:57,466
Should this have remained unseen
at the bottom of the ocean for eternity...

105
00:11:57,712 --> 00:11:59,714
when we can see and enjoy it now?

106
00:11:59,964 --> 00:12:01,807
I'll be goddamned.

107
00:12:05,219 --> 00:12:06,220
Brock!

108
00:12:06,804 --> 00:12:08,477
There's a satellite call for you.

109
00:12:08,723 --> 00:12:12,068
Bobby, we're launching. You see
these submersibles going in the water?

110
00:12:12,310 --> 00:12:14,733
Trust me, buddy. You want to take this call.

111
00:12:16,064 --> 00:12:17,907
This better be good.

112
00:12:18,232 --> 00:12:20,906
Now, you gotta speak up. She's kind of old.

113
00:12:21,152 --> 00:12:22,324
Great.

114
00:12:23,820 --> 00:12:26,574
This is Brock Lovett.
How can I help you, Mrs...?

115
00:12:26,824 --> 00:12:28,920
Calvert. Rose Calvert.

116
00:12:28,950 --> 00:12:29,952
Mrs. Calvert.

117
00:12:30,995 --> 00:12:33,919
I was just wondering if you had found...

118
00:12:34,165 --> 00:12:36,167
the "Heart of the Ocean" yet, Mr. Lovett.

119
00:12:38,503 --> 00:12:40,255
Told you you wanted to take the call.

120
00:12:42,507 --> 00:12:45,511
All right, you have my attention, Rose.

121
00:12:45,843 --> 00:12:48,096
Can you tell us who the woman in the picture is?

122
00:12:48,513 --> 00:12:51,858
Oh, yes. The woman in the picture is me.

123
00:13:08,282 --> 00:13:12,458
She's a goddamn liar!
Some nutcase seeking money or publicity.

124
00:13:12,870 --> 00:13:16,545
God only knows why.
Like that Russian babe, Anesthesia.

125
00:13:16,874 --> 00:13:18,717
They're inbound!

126
00:13:23,714 --> 00:13:27,639
Rose DeWitt Bukater died on the
Titanic when she was seventeen, right?

127
00:13:28,553 --> 00:13:31,397
- That's right.
- If she had lived, she'd be over 100 by now.

128
00:13:31,722 --> 00:13:33,895
101 next month.

129
00:13:34,225 --> 00:13:37,069
Okay, so she's a very old goddamn liar.

130
00:13:37,310 --> 00:13:39,484
Look, I've already done the
background on this woman...

131
00:13:39,730 --> 00:13:43,576
all the way back to the 20s,
when she was working as an actress.

132
00:13:43,900 --> 00:13:46,745
An actress. There's your first clue, Sherlock.

133
00:13:47,070 --> 00:13:51,372
Her name was Rose Dawson back then.
Then she marries this guy named Calvert.

134
00:13:51,576 --> 00:13:54,921
They move to Cedar Rapids
and she punches out a couple of kids.

135
00:13:55,246 --> 00:13:58,420
Now Calvert's dead and,
from what I hear, Cedar Rapids is dead.

136
00:13:58,666 --> 00:14:01,010
And everybody who knows about the
diamond is supposed to be dead...

137
00:14:01,210 --> 00:14:03,212
or on this boat, but she knows.

138
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:19,195
Doesn't exactly travel light, does she?

139
00:14:19,562 --> 00:14:20,609
Hurry up, give him a hand.

140
00:14:21,355 --> 00:14:25,030
Mrs. Calvert, I'm Brock Lovett.
Welcome to the Keldysh.

141
00:14:27,278 --> 00:14:29,121
Okay, let's get her inside there.

142
00:14:29,614 --> 00:14:30,615
Hi, Miss Calvert.

143
00:14:31,282 --> 00:14:32,875
- Hi.
- Welcome to the Keldysh.

144
00:14:33,618 --> 00:14:34,961
Thanks.

145
00:14:36,620 --> 00:14:37,622
Hey!

146
00:14:45,796 --> 00:14:47,298
Are your staterooms all right?

147
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:48,424
Oh, yes.

148
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:49,471
Very nice.

149
00:14:49,717 --> 00:14:51,845
Have you met my granddaughter, Lizzy?

150
00:14:51,890 --> 00:14:53,437
She takes care of me.

151
00:14:54,388 --> 00:14:56,550
We met just a few minutes ago.

152
00:14:56,560 --> 00:14:57,774
Remember, Nana? Up on deck?

153
00:14:58,059 --> 00:14:59,151
Oh, yes.

154
00:15:00,186 --> 00:15:01,733
There. That's nice.

155
00:15:02,396 --> 00:15:04,800
Have to have my pictures when I travel.

156
00:15:04,810 --> 00:15:05,910
Can I get you anything?

157
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:07,152
Is there anything you'd like?

158
00:15:08,736 --> 00:15:09,908
Yes.

159
00:15:10,404 --> 00:15:12,748
I would like to see my drawing.

160
00:15:26,587 --> 00:15:29,511
Louis XVI wore a fabulous stone that was...

161
00:15:29,715 --> 00:15:31,308
called the Blue Diamond of the Crown...

162
00:15:31,592 --> 00:15:34,266
which disappeared in 1792...

163
00:15:34,512 --> 00:15:38,187
about the same time old Louis
lost everything from the neck up.

164
00:15:38,766 --> 00:15:42,270
The theory goes that the
crown diamond was chopped, too.

165
00:15:43,104 --> 00:15:44,777
Recut into a heart-like shape
that became known as---

166
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:46,983
the Heart of the Ocean.

167
00:15:47,190 --> 00:15:49,865
Today it would be worth
more than the Hope diamond.

168
00:15:50,110 --> 00:15:52,284
It was a dreadful, heavy thing.

169
00:15:52,613 --> 00:15:54,615
I only wore it this once.

170
00:15:55,366 --> 00:15:57,209
You actually think this is you, Nana?

171
00:15:57,450 --> 00:15:59,328
It is me, dear.

172
00:15:59,579 --> 00:16:01,331
Wasn't I a dish?

173
00:16:03,374 --> 00:16:06,048
I tracked it down through insurance records.

174
00:16:06,294 --> 00:16:10,049
An old claim that was settled
under terms of absolute secrecy.

175
00:16:11,132 --> 00:16:13,806
Can you tell me who the claimant was, Rose?

176
00:16:14,135 --> 00:16:16,729
I should imagine someone named Hockley.

177
00:16:17,138 --> 00:16:18,765
Nathan Hockley, that's right.

178
00:16:19,390 --> 00:16:21,233
Pittsburgh steel tycoon.

179
00:16:21,475 --> 00:16:23,920
The claim was for a diamond necklace his son,

180
00:16:23,930 --> 00:16:25,404
Caledon, bought his fiancée.

181
00:16:25,813 --> 00:16:26,814
You.

182
00:16:27,230 --> 00:16:29,484
A week before he sailed on Titanic.

183
00:16:30,484 --> 00:16:32,828
And it was filed right after the sinking.

184
00:16:33,654 --> 00:16:36,749
So the diamond had to have
gone down with the ship.

185
00:16:38,159 --> 00:16:39,331
You see the date?

186
00:16:40,828 --> 00:16:42,830
April 4, 1912.

187
00:16:43,164 --> 00:16:46,008
Which means if your grandmother
is who she says she is...

188
00:16:46,250 --> 00:16:48,924
she was wearing the diamond
the day the Titanic sank.

189
00:16:49,170 --> 00:16:52,299
And that makes you my new best friend.

190
00:16:53,174 --> 00:16:55,302
These are some of the things
we recovered from your stateroom.

191
00:16:58,846 --> 00:17:00,689
This was mine.

192
00:17:01,849 --> 00:17:04,022
How extraordinary.

193
00:17:04,685 --> 00:17:08,110
And it looks the same as it
did the last time I saw it.

194
00:17:13,860 --> 00:17:16,364
The reflection has changed a bit.

195
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:35,554
Are you ready to go back to Titanic?

196
00:17:39,095 --> 00:17:40,312
Okay, here we go.

197
00:17:40,513 --> 00:17:43,670
She hits the berg on the starboard side, right?

198
00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:44,780
She kind of bumps along...

199
00:17:44,790 --> 00:17:46,019
punching holes like morse code...

200
00:17:46,268 --> 00:17:47,640
dit-dit-dit, along the side...

201
00:17:47,650 --> 00:17:48,740
below the waterline.

202
00:17:48,750 --> 00:17:52,404
Then the forward compartments start to flood.

203
00:17:52,650 --> 00:17:53,900
Now, as the water level rises...

204
00:17:53,910 --> 00:17:55,778
it spills over the watertight bulkheads...

205
00:17:55,986 --> 00:17:58,830
which, unfortunately,
don't go any higher than E deck.

206
00:17:58,840 --> 00:18:00,496
So now as the bow goes down...

207
00:18:00,740 --> 00:18:03,340
the stern rises up, slow at first...

208
00:18:03,350 --> 00:18:04,920
then faster and faster...

209
00:18:05,246 --> 00:18:07,419
until finally, she's got her
whole ass sticking up in the air.

210
00:18:08,416 --> 00:18:09,463
And that's a big ass.

211
00:18:10,292 --> 00:18:12,420
We're talking 20, 30,000 tons. Okay?

212
00:18:12,670 --> 00:18:14,820
And the hull's not designed
to deal with that pressure-

213
00:18:14,830 --> 00:18:16,557
So, what happens?

214
00:18:17,007 --> 00:18:18,790
She splits, right down to the keel.

215
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:19,802
And the stern...

216
00:18:20,260 --> 00:18:21,340
falls back level.

217
00:18:21,350 --> 00:18:22,440
Then...

218
00:18:22,450 --> 00:18:23,520
as the bow sinks...

219
00:18:23,530 --> 00:18:25,520
it pulls the stern vertical...

220
00:18:25,530 --> 00:18:27,689
and then finally detaches.

221
00:18:27,935 --> 00:18:31,781
Now the stern section just kind of bobs
there like a cork for a couple of minutes...

222
00:18:32,022 --> 00:18:35,196
floods, and finally goes under about 2:20am...

223
00:18:35,443 --> 00:18:37,616
Two hours and forty minutes after the collision,

224
00:18:39,113 --> 00:18:40,456
the bow section planes away...

225
00:18:40,740 --> 00:18:43,414
landing about a half a mile away...

226
00:18:43,743 --> 00:18:45,495
going twenty, thirty knots
when it hits the ocean floor.

227
00:18:49,790 --> 00:18:51,383
Pretty cool, huh?

228
00:18:51,625 --> 00:18:55,971
Thank you for that fine
forensic analysis, Mr. Bodine.

229
00:18:56,797 --> 00:19:00,142
Of course, the experience of it was...

230
00:19:00,968 --> 00:19:02,641
somewhat different.

231
00:19:03,137 --> 00:19:05,139
Will you share it with us?

232
00:20:00,069 --> 00:20:01,190
I'm taking her to rest.

233
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:02,270
No.

234
00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:03,620
Come on, Nana.

235
00:20:03,630 --> 00:20:04,957
No!

236
00:20:09,036 --> 00:20:10,709
Give me the tape recorder.

237
00:20:13,707 --> 00:20:14,879
Tell us, Rose.

238
00:20:16,877 --> 00:20:19,050
It's been 84 years--

239
00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:21,330
It's okay. Just try to remember anything...

240
00:20:21,340 --> 00:20:22,762
anything at all.

241
00:20:23,884 --> 00:20:26,728
Do you want to hear this or not, Mr. Lovett?

242
00:20:30,724 --> 00:20:33,728
It's been 84 years...

243
00:20:35,563 --> 00:20:38,567
and I can still smell the fresh paint.

244
00:20:40,359 --> 00:20:43,203
The china had never been used.

245
00:20:43,904 --> 00:20:46,578
The sheets had never been slept in.

246
00:20:48,242 --> 00:20:52,167
Titanic was called the ship of dreams.

247
00:20:53,664 --> 00:20:54,836
And it was.

248
00:20:56,083 --> 00:20:57,801
It really was.

249
00:21:28,157 --> 00:21:29,534
All third-class passengers...

250
00:21:30,326 --> 00:21:31,860
with a forward berth...

251
00:21:31,870 --> 00:21:34,167
this way please! This queue!

252
00:21:34,705 --> 00:21:36,207
It's a big boat, huh?

253
00:21:36,457 --> 00:21:38,540
Daddy, it's a ship.

254
00:21:38,550 --> 00:21:39,543
You're right.

255
00:22:09,573 --> 00:22:11,541
I don't see what all the fuss is about.

256
00:22:12,159 --> 00:22:14,161
It doesn't look any bigger than the Mauretania.

257
00:22:14,410 --> 00:22:16,250
You can be blasé about some things, Rose...

258
00:22:16,260 --> 00:22:17,998
but not about Titanic.

259
00:22:18,248 --> 00:22:20,020
It's over 100 feet longer than Mauretania...

260
00:22:20,030 --> 00:22:21,589
and far more luxurious.

261
00:22:22,419 --> 00:22:24,888
Your daughter is far too
difficult to impress, Ruth.

262
00:22:25,839 --> 00:22:28,220
So this is the ship they say is unsinkable.

263
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:29,320
It is unsinkable.

264
00:22:29,420 --> 00:22:30,820
God Himself could not sink this ship--

265
00:22:30,830 --> 00:22:31,970
What?!

266
00:22:31,980 --> 00:22:33,520
You have to check your baggage
through the main terminal.

267
00:22:33,620 --> 00:22:34,772
It's round that way, sir.

268
00:22:35,182 --> 00:22:36,620
I put my faith in you good sir.

269
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:37,810
Now kindly see my man.

270
00:22:38,018 --> 00:22:39,220
Yes sir. It's my pleasure, sir.

271
00:22:39,320 --> 00:22:40,320
If I can do anything at all...

272
00:22:40,420 --> 00:22:41,697
Yes, right.

273
00:22:42,022 --> 00:22:43,920
All the trunks from that car there.

274
00:22:44,020 --> 00:22:46,072
Twelve from here.

275
00:22:46,360 --> 00:22:49,220
And the safe, to the parlor suite...

276
00:22:49,320 --> 00:22:51,031
rooms B-52, 54, 56.

277
00:22:53,367 --> 00:22:54,368
Ladies...

278
00:22:54,576 --> 00:22:56,203
we better hurry.

279
00:22:56,495 --> 00:22:57,496
Come along.

280
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,253
- My coat?
- I have it, miss.

281
00:23:06,505 --> 00:23:10,681
All third-class passengers
queue here for health inspection

282
00:23:16,849 --> 00:23:19,352
- Welcome aboard, ma'am.
- Welcome to Titanic.

283
00:23:20,810 --> 00:23:22,720
It was the ship of dreams...

284
00:23:22,730 --> 00:23:24,107
to everyone else.

285
00:23:24,898 --> 00:23:27,401
To me, it was a slave ship...

286
00:23:27,735 --> 00:23:30,909
taking me back to America in chains.

287
00:23:31,905 --> 00:23:35,910
Outwardly, I was everything
a well brought up girl should be.

288
00:23:36,243 --> 00:23:38,746
Inside, I was screaming.

289
00:23:55,262 --> 00:23:56,520
Jack, you are pazzo.

290
00:23:56,620 --> 00:23:58,440
You bet everything we have.

291
00:23:59,516 --> 00:24:01,769
When you got nothing, you got nothing to lose.

292
00:24:09,193 --> 00:24:10,240
Sven?

293
00:24:31,965 --> 00:24:34,309
All right, moment of truth.

294
00:24:34,635 --> 00:24:36,808
Someone's life is about to change.

295
00:24:37,012 --> 00:24:38,184
Fabrizio?

296
00:24:40,516 --> 00:24:42,644
Niente.

297
00:24:43,810 --> 00:24:44,812
Olaf?

298
00:24:45,813 --> 00:24:46,985
Nothing.

299
00:24:47,314 --> 00:24:48,486
Sven?

300
00:24:51,318 --> 00:24:53,992
Uh-oh. Two pair.

301
00:24:54,822 --> 00:24:56,244
I'm sorry, Fabrizio.

302
00:24:58,408 --> 00:24:59,620
I'm sorry...

303
00:24:59,720 --> 00:25:00,790
you're not gonna see your mom again for a...

304
00:25:01,245 --> 00:25:02,820
long time...

305
00:25:02,920 --> 00:25:04,586
'cause we're going to America.

306
00:25:04,873 --> 00:25:05,965
Full house, boys!

307
00:25:20,180 --> 00:25:21,352
Come on.

308
00:25:22,266 --> 00:25:23,859
I'm going home!

309
00:25:26,645 --> 00:25:28,320
I'm going home.

310
00:25:28,420 --> 00:25:29,740
I go to America!

311
00:25:30,023 --> 00:25:31,366
No, mate.

312
00:25:31,692 --> 00:25:33,620
Titanic go to America,

313
00:25:33,720 --> 00:25:35,196
in five minutes.

314
00:25:35,696 --> 00:25:36,820
Shit. Fabri. Come on.

315
00:25:36,920 --> 00:25:37,869
Come on, here. Here.

316
00:25:40,284 --> 00:25:42,082
We're riding in high style now!

317
00:25:42,870 --> 00:25:44,720
We're a couple of regular swells.

318
00:25:44,820 --> 00:25:46,420
We're practically goddamn royalty...

319
00:25:46,520 --> 00:25:47,499
ragazzo mio.

320
00:25:47,708 --> 00:25:49,710
You see? Is my destine.

321
00:25:50,169 --> 00:25:51,320
Like I told you...

322
00:25:51,420 --> 00:25:53,088
I go to America to be millionaire.

323
00:25:56,383 --> 00:25:57,620
You are pazzo.

324
00:25:57,720 --> 00:25:59,307
Maybe, but I've got the tickets.

325
00:26:01,138 --> 00:26:02,720
Come on, I thought you were fast.

326
00:26:02,820 --> 00:26:03,724
Aspetra!

327
00:26:04,308 --> 00:26:05,720
Whoa. Wait! Wait!

328
00:26:05,820 --> 00:26:06,810
Hey. wait!

329
00:26:07,352 --> 00:26:08,353
We're passengers!

330
00:26:11,230 --> 00:26:12,520
Have you been through the inspection queue?

331
00:26:12,620 --> 00:26:13,620
Of course.

332
00:26:13,720 --> 00:26:15,220
Anyway, we don't have any lice.

333
00:26:15,320 --> 00:26:17,220
We're Americans. Both of us.

334
00:26:17,320 --> 00:26:18,320
Right.

335
00:26:18,420 --> 00:26:19,323
Come aboard.

336
00:26:23,577 --> 00:26:25,220
We're the luckiest sons of bitches in the world.

337
00:26:25,320 --> 00:26:26,288
You know that?

338
00:26:35,422 --> 00:26:36,514
Good-bye!

339
00:26:40,552 --> 00:26:41,620
You know somebody?

340
00:26:41,720 --> 00:26:43,180
Of course not. That's not the point.

341
00:26:43,430 --> 00:26:44,773
Good-bye! I'll miss you!

342
00:26:45,098 --> 00:26:46,224
Good-bye!

343
00:26:46,683 --> 00:26:48,401
I will never forget you!

344
00:27:36,650 --> 00:27:38,618
Come with me, darling. Let's go.

345
00:27:41,154 --> 00:27:42,497
G-60.

346
00:27:43,490 --> 00:27:45,163
G-60. G-60.

347
00:27:45,492 --> 00:27:46,584
Excuse me, ma'am.

348
00:27:47,494 --> 00:27:48,837
G-60.

349
00:27:50,163 --> 00:27:51,836
Oh, right here.

350
00:27:52,332 --> 00:27:53,424
Hey, how you doing?

351
00:27:53,625 --> 00:27:55,548
Jack. Nice to meet you.

352
00:27:55,836 --> 00:27:57,338
Jack Dawson. Nice to meet you.

353
00:27:57,796 --> 00:27:58,797
How you doing?

354
00:27:59,506 --> 00:28:01,850
Who says you get top bunk, huh?

355
00:28:07,472 --> 00:28:09,720
This is your private promenade deck, sir.

356
00:28:09,820 --> 00:28:11,978
Will you be requiring anything?

357
00:28:12,185 --> 00:28:13,528
Excuse me.

358
00:28:13,937 --> 00:28:15,610
- This one?
- No.

359
00:28:15,856 --> 00:28:18,109
It had a lot of faces on it.

360
00:28:18,525 --> 00:28:20,027
This is the one.

361
00:28:21,695 --> 00:28:23,538
Would you like all of them out, miss?

362
00:28:23,864 --> 00:28:27,038
Yes. We need a little color in this room.

363
00:28:30,662 --> 00:28:32,084
Put in there. In the wardrobe.

364
00:28:33,040 --> 00:28:35,293
God, not those finger paintings again.

365
00:28:35,542 --> 00:28:36,964
They certainly were a waste of money.

366
00:28:37,210 --> 00:28:39,120
The difference between Cal's taste in art...

367
00:28:39,220 --> 00:28:40,720
and mine is that I have some.

368
00:28:40,820 --> 00:28:41,798
They're fascinating.

369
00:28:42,883 --> 00:28:45,306
Like being inside a dream or something.

370
00:28:45,552 --> 00:28:46,895
There's truth but no logic.

371
00:28:47,137 --> 00:28:49,981
- What's the artist's name?
- Something Picasso.

372
00:28:50,223 --> 00:28:51,420
Something Picasso.

373
00:28:51,520 --> 00:28:53,320
He won't amount in a thing.

374
00:28:53,420 --> 00:28:54,604
He won't, trust me.

375
00:28:54,895 --> 00:28:57,148
- Let's put the Degas in the bedroom.
- At least they were cheap.

376
00:28:57,898 --> 00:28:59,741
Put it in the wardrobe.

377
00:29:05,238 --> 00:29:09,584
At Cherbourg, a woman came
aboard named Margaret Brown.

378
00:29:09,910 --> 00:29:11,583
We all called her Molly.

379
00:29:11,912 --> 00:29:15,086
History would call her
the Unsinkable Molly Brown.

380
00:29:15,415 --> 00:29:17,620
Well, I wasn't about to
wait all day for you, sonny.

381
00:29:17,720 --> 00:29:19,795
Here, if you think you can manage.

382
00:29:20,420 --> 00:29:23,424
Her husband had struck gold
someplace out west.

383
00:29:23,757 --> 00:29:26,556
And she was what Mother called "new money."

384
00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:29,120
By the next afternoon,

385
00:29:29,220 --> 00:29:31,856
we were steaming west
from the coast of Ireland...

386
00:29:32,724 --> 00:29:36,228
with nothing out ahead of us but ocean.

387
00:29:42,442 --> 00:29:44,615
Take her to sea, Mr. Murdoch.

388
00:29:45,529 --> 00:29:46,746
Let's stretch her legs.

389
00:29:47,197 --> 00:29:48,198
Yes sir.

390
00:29:50,450 --> 00:29:51,497
All ahead full, Mr. Moody.

391
00:29:52,244 --> 00:29:53,291
Very good, sir.

392
00:29:58,750 --> 00:29:59,876
All ahead full.

393
00:30:00,585 --> 00:30:02,007
All ahead full!

394
00:30:02,838 --> 00:30:04,055
Come on lads, step lively!

395
00:30:22,566 --> 00:30:24,694
All right! Let's stoke her right up!

396
00:30:24,900 --> 00:30:26,118
We go full ahead!

397
00:30:26,445 --> 00:30:28,447
Come on, put your backs into it!

398
00:31:23,210 --> 00:31:25,053
21 knots, sir.

399
00:31:33,970 --> 00:31:34,971
Hey, look, look, look!

400
00:31:38,225 --> 00:31:39,568
See it?

401
00:31:42,896 --> 00:31:44,898
There's another one! See him?

402
00:31:55,283 --> 00:31:57,081
Look at that one! Look at him jump!

403
00:32:23,687 --> 00:32:25,940
I can see the Statue of Liberty already.

404
00:32:26,273 --> 00:32:27,695
Very small, of course.

405
00:32:31,278 --> 00:32:34,122
I'm the king of the world!

406
00:33:20,160 --> 00:33:23,164
She is the largest moving object
ever made by the hand of man...

407
00:33:23,413 --> 00:33:25,415
in all history.

408
00:33:25,749 --> 00:33:27,920
And our master shipbuilder, Mr. Andrews here...

409
00:33:28,020 --> 00:33:29,836
designed her from the keel plates up.

410
00:33:30,086 --> 00:33:32,120
I may have knocked her together, but...

411
00:33:32,220 --> 00:33:34,307
the idea was Mr. Ismay's.

412
00:33:34,758 --> 00:33:37,120
He envisioned a steamer so grand in scale...

413
00:33:37,220 --> 00:33:38,320
and so luxurious in...

414
00:33:38,420 --> 00:33:39,420
its appointments...

415
00:33:39,520 --> 00:33:41,720
that its supremacy would never be challenged.

416
00:33:41,820 --> 00:33:43,267
And here she is.

417
00:33:43,516 --> 00:33:46,816
- Willed into solid reality.
- Hear, hear.

418
00:33:47,979 --> 00:33:49,526
I'll have the salmon.

419
00:33:52,525 --> 00:33:55,028
You know I don't like that, Rose.

420
00:33:58,530 --> 00:33:59,874
She knows.

421
00:34:02,702 --> 00:34:04,220
We'll both have the lamb.

422
00:34:04,320 --> 00:34:06,460
Rare, with very little mint sauce.

423
00:34:07,540 --> 00:34:09,133
You like lamb, right sweet pea?

424
00:34:11,795 --> 00:34:13,968
You gonna cut her meat for her too there, Cal?

425
00:34:16,549 --> 00:34:19,393
Hey, who thought of the name Titanic?

426
00:34:20,220 --> 00:34:21,320
Was it you, Bruce?

427
00:34:21,420 --> 00:34:22,731
Yes, actually.

428
00:34:23,556 --> 00:34:27,732
I wanted to convey sheer size.
And size means stability...

429
00:34:28,228 --> 00:34:31,232
luxury, and above all, strength.

430
00:34:32,065 --> 00:34:34,568
Do you know of Dr. Freud, Mr. Ismay?

431
00:34:34,818 --> 00:34:39,164
His ideas about the male preoccupation with
size might be of particular interest to you.

432
00:34:40,573 --> 00:34:41,916
What's gotten into you?

433
00:34:42,158 --> 00:34:43,501
Excuse me.

434
00:34:48,080 --> 00:34:49,424
I do apologize.

435
00:34:49,666 --> 00:34:51,714
She's a pistol, Cal. Hope you can handle her.

436
00:34:52,585 --> 00:34:56,340
Well, I may have to start minding what she
reads from now on, won'! I, Mrs. Brown?

437
00:34:56,756 --> 00:34:59,509
Freud? Who is he? Is he a passenger?

438
00:35:11,813 --> 00:35:13,656
The ship is nice, huh?

439
00:35:14,649 --> 00:35:15,720
Yeah. It's an Irish ship.

440
00:35:15,820 --> 00:35:16,820
Is English, no?

441
00:35:16,920 --> 00:35:17,920
No, it was built in Ireland.

442
00:35:18,020 --> 00:35:19,920
Fifteen thousand Irishmen built this ship.

443
00:35:20,020 --> 00:35:22,662
Solid as a rock. Big Irish hands.

444
00:35:23,324 --> 00:35:24,420
That's typical.

445
00:35:24,520 --> 00:35:27,500
First-class dogs come down here to take a shite.

446
00:35:28,246 --> 00:35:30,294
Lets us know where we rank
in the scheme of things.

447
00:35:30,498 --> 00:35:32,171
Like we could forget?

448
00:35:33,835 --> 00:35:35,007
I'm Tommy Ryan.

449
00:35:35,295 --> 00:35:37,343
- Jack Dawson.
- Fabrizio.

450
00:35:39,424 --> 00:35:40,971
Do you make any money with your drawings?

451
00:35:52,020 --> 00:35:53,720
Ah, forget it, boyo.

452
00:35:53,820 --> 00:35:56,120
You'd as like have angels fly
out of your arse as get next to...

453
00:35:56,220 --> 00:35:57,693
the likes of her.

454
00:36:21,049 --> 00:36:25,054
I saw my whole life as if
I'd already lived it.

455
00:36:25,386 --> 00:36:28,890
An endless parade of
parties and cotillions...

456
00:36:29,224 --> 00:36:31,226
yachts and polo matches.

457
00:36:31,893 --> 00:36:36,569
Always the same narrow people,
the same mindless chatter.

458
00:36:37,065 --> 00:36:40,911
I felt like I was
standing at a great precipice.

459
00:36:41,569 --> 00:36:45,745
with no one to pull me back.
No one who cared...

460
00:36:46,074 --> 00:36:48,247
or even noticed.

461
00:38:38,810 --> 00:38:39,812
Don't do it.

462
00:38:40,855 --> 00:38:42,198
Stay back.

463
00:38:43,190 --> 00:38:44,192
Don't come any closer.

464
00:38:45,944 --> 00:38:47,020
Come on.

465
00:38:47,120 --> 00:38:48,450
Just give me your hand. I'll pull you back over.

466
00:38:48,655 --> 00:38:49,872
No! Stay where you are.

467
00:38:51,199 --> 00:38:52,200
I mean it.

468
00:38:52,867 --> 00:38:54,540
I'll let go.

469
00:39:05,546 --> 00:39:07,048
No, you won't.

470
00:39:08,549 --> 00:39:10,392
What do you mean, no I won't?

471
00:39:10,677 --> 00:39:13,420
Don't presume to tell me
what I will and will not do.

472
00:39:13,520 --> 00:39:14,720
You don't know me.

473
00:39:14,820 --> 00:39:16,895
Well, you would have done it already.

474
00:39:17,558 --> 00:39:19,731
You're distracting me. Go away.

475
00:39:20,060 --> 00:39:21,320
I can't.

476
00:39:21,420 --> 00:39:22,648
I'm involved now.

477
00:39:23,564 --> 00:39:26,909
You let go, and I'm going to
have to jump in there after you.

478
00:39:28,736 --> 00:39:30,238
Don't be absurd.

479
00:39:30,570 --> 00:39:32,744
- You'll be killed.
- I'm a good swimmer.

480
00:39:33,074 --> 00:39:34,917
The fall alone will kill you.

481
00:39:35,243 --> 00:39:38,417
It would hurt. I'm not saying it wouldn't.

482
00:39:39,080 --> 00:39:40,206
Tell you the truth...

483
00:39:40,707 --> 00:39:43,335
I'm a lot more concerned
about that water being so cold.

484
00:39:50,425 --> 00:39:51,722
How cold?

485
00:39:52,093 --> 00:39:55,267
Freezing. Maybe a couple degrees over.

486
00:39:59,767 --> 00:40:00,768
You ever, uh...

487
00:40:01,102 --> 00:40:02,854
...ever been to Wisconsin?

488
00:40:06,107 --> 00:40:07,279
What?

489
00:40:07,567 --> 00:40:09,786
Well, they have some of
the coldest winters around.

490
00:40:10,278 --> 00:40:12,952
I grew up there, near Chippewa Falls.

491
00:40:13,280 --> 00:40:16,956
I remember when I was a kid,
me and my father, we went ice fishing...

492
00:40:17,285 --> 00:40:19,128
out on Lake Wissota.

493
00:40:19,704 --> 00:40:20,956
Ice fishing is, you know, where you--

494
00:40:21,289 --> 00:40:22,882
I know what ice fishing is!

495
00:40:24,125 --> 00:40:25,297
Sorry.

496
00:40:26,460 --> 00:40:30,136
You just seem like, you know,
kind of an indoor girl.

497
00:40:32,133 --> 00:40:33,476
Anyway, I...

498
00:40:34,802 --> 00:40:36,475
fell through some thin ice.

499
00:40:36,970 --> 00:40:38,314
And I'm telling you...

500
00:40:39,974 --> 00:40:41,420
water that cold,

501
00:40:41,520 --> 00:40:43,311
like right down there...

502
00:40:44,103 --> 00:40:47,448
it hits you like a thousand knives
stabbing you all over your body.

503
00:40:48,940 --> 00:40:50,284
You can't breathe.

504
00:40:51,319 --> 00:40:55,790
You can't think.
Least not about anything but the pain.

505
00:40:58,826 --> 00:41:02,080
Which is why I'm not looking
forward to jumping in there after you.

506
00:41:03,164 --> 00:41:04,165
Like I said...

507
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:07,673
I don't have a choice.

508
00:41:11,839 --> 00:41:14,720
I guess I'm kind of hoping you'll
come back over the rail and...

509
00:41:14,820 --> 00:41:16,181
and get me off the hook here.

510
00:41:17,010 --> 00:41:18,354
You're crazy.

511
00:41:19,680 --> 00:41:21,853
That's what everybody says but...

512
00:41:23,350 --> 00:41:25,020
with all due respect, miss...

513
00:41:25,120 --> 00:41:27,856
I'm not the one hanging off
the back of a ship here.

514
00:41:28,689 --> 00:41:30,032
Come on.

515
00:41:30,690 --> 00:41:32,364
Come on, give me your hand.

516
00:41:33,277 --> 00:41:34,529
You don't want to do this.

517
00:41:50,545 --> 00:41:52,047
I'm Jack Dawson.

518
00:41:53,548 --> 00:41:55,221
Rose Dewitt Bukater

519
00:41:55,508 --> 00:41:57,226
I'll have to get you to write that one down-

520
00:41:59,720 --> 00:42:00,892
Come on.

521
00:42:06,185 --> 00:42:07,186
I got you.

522
00:42:07,687 --> 00:42:08,688
Come on.

523
00:42:09,063 --> 00:42:10,406
Come on.

524
00:42:14,860 --> 00:42:16,204
Help. please!

525
00:42:16,487 --> 00:42:18,080
Help!

526
00:42:19,532 --> 00:42:20,620
- Please, help me!
- Listen. Listen to me.

527
00:42:20,720 --> 00:42:22,320
Listen. Listen to me.

528
00:42:22,420 --> 00:42:24,083
I've got you. I won't let go.

529
00:42:24,370 --> 00:42:26,372
Now pull yourself up. Come on!

530
00:42:29,417 --> 00:42:30,418
Come on.

531
00:42:30,668 --> 00:42:31,715
That's right.

532
00:42:32,253 --> 00:42:33,345
You can do it.

533
00:42:38,259 --> 00:42:39,602
I got you.

534
00:42:45,266 --> 00:42:46,768
What's all this?

535
00:42:52,607 --> 00:42:53,779
You stand back and...

536
00:42:54,108 --> 00:42:55,530
don't move an inch!

537
00:42:57,862 --> 00:42:58,988
Fetch the Master at Arms.

538
00:43:01,616 --> 00:43:03,220
This is completely unacceptable!

539
00:43:03,320 --> 00:43:06,128
What made you think that you could
put your hands on my fiancée?!

540
00:43:07,788 --> 00:43:08,960
Look at me, you filth!

541
00:43:09,290 --> 00:43:10,420
Cal.

542
00:43:10,520 --> 00:43:11,584
What do you think you were doing?

543
00:43:11,792 --> 00:43:14,295
Cal, stop. It was an accident.

544
00:43:14,962 --> 00:43:16,635
An accident?

545
00:43:16,964 --> 00:43:18,307
It was.

546
00:43:19,300 --> 00:43:20,472
Stupid, really.

547
00:43:21,302 --> 00:43:23,805
I was leaning over and I slipped.

548
00:43:26,307 --> 00:43:29,811
I was leaning far over to see the, uh...

549
00:43:30,144 --> 00:43:32,488
uh, uh, the uh...

550
00:43:33,314 --> 00:43:35,658
- Propellers?
- Propellers, and I slipped.

551
00:43:35,983 --> 00:43:38,657
And I would have gone
overboard but Mr. Dawson here...

552
00:43:38,986 --> 00:43:42,160
saved me. And almost went over himself.

553
00:43:43,074 --> 00:43:44,166
You wanted to see the...
She wanted to see the propellers.

554
00:43:44,492 --> 00:43:47,666
Like I said, women and machinery do not mix.

555
00:43:48,496 --> 00:43:50,498
Was that the way of it?

556
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:55,002
Yeah. Yeah, that was pretty much it.

557
00:43:55,336 --> 00:43:56,838
Well, the boy's a hero then.

558
00:43:57,505 --> 00:43:58,757
Good for you, son. Well done.

559
00:43:59,006 --> 00:44:01,008
So, it's all's well and back to our brandy, eh?

560
00:44:03,678 --> 00:44:07,023
Look at you. You must be freezing.
Let's get you inside.

561
00:44:07,682 --> 00:44:10,026
Perhaps a little something for the boy?

562
00:44:12,186 --> 00:44:13,529
Of course.

563
00:44:13,813 --> 00:44:17,363
Mr. Lovejoy, I think a twenty should do it.

564
00:44:18,025 --> 00:44:20,699
Is that the going rate for
saving the woman you love?

565
00:44:22,363 --> 00:44:24,206
Rose is displeased.

566
00:44:24,699 --> 00:44:26,372
What to do?

567
00:44:26,826 --> 00:44:27,827
I know.

568
00:44:30,037 --> 00:44:33,712
Perhaps you could join us
for dinner tomorrow evening...

569
00:44:34,040 --> 00:44:35,543
to regale our group...

570
00:44:35,876 --> 00:44:38,049
with your heroic tale.

571
00:44:40,380 --> 00:44:42,554
Sure. Count me in.

572
00:44:42,883 --> 00:44:45,227
Good. It's settled then.

573
00:44:46,220 --> 00:44:47,563
This should be interesting.

574
00:44:56,897 --> 00:44:59,571
Can I bum a smoke?

575
00:45:08,409 --> 00:45:09,581
You'll want to tie those.

576
00:45:12,246 --> 00:45:13,338
It's interesting...

577
00:45:13,914 --> 00:45:15,666
the young lady slipped so suddenly...

578
00:45:15,875 --> 00:45:19,254
and you still had time to remove
your jacket and your shoes.

579
00:45:35,436 --> 00:45:37,438
I know you've been melancholy.

580
00:45:38,439 --> 00:45:40,441
I don't pretend to know why.

581
00:45:43,110 --> 00:45:45,283
I intended to save this...

582
00:45:45,780 --> 00:45:50,456
until the engagement gala next week...

583
00:45:51,786 --> 00:45:54,130
but I thought...

584
00:45:54,455 --> 00:45:55,798
tonight.

585
00:45:57,249 --> 00:45:58,466
Good gracious.

586
00:45:59,377 --> 00:46:02,130
Perhaps as a reminder of my feelings for you.

587
00:46:02,963 --> 00:46:04,260
- Is it a--
- Diamond. Yes.

588
00:46:06,800 --> 00:46:09,975
56 carats to be exact.

589
00:46:11,972 --> 00:46:14,316
It was worn by Louis XVI.

590
00:46:15,142 --> 00:46:17,486
And they called it Le Coeur de La Mer.

591
00:46:17,978 --> 00:46:19,821
- The Heart of the Ocean.
- The Heart of the Ocean. Yes.

592
00:46:26,320 --> 00:46:27,993
It's overwhelming.

593
00:46:28,447 --> 00:46:30,120
Well, it's for royalty.

594
00:46:31,325 --> 00:46:33,498
We are royalty, Rose.

595
00:46:37,498 --> 00:46:39,842
You know, there's nothing I couldn't give you.

596
00:46:40,668 --> 00:46:42,670
There's nothing I'd deny you...

597
00:46:43,337 --> 00:46:45,510
if you would not deny me.

598
00:46:49,677 --> 00:46:52,021
Open your heart to me, Rose.

599
00:47:07,528 --> 00:47:11,408
Well, I've been on my own since
I was 15, since my folks died.

600
00:47:12,533 --> 00:47:16,538
And I had no brothers or sisters or
close kin in that part of the country,

601
00:47:16,996 --> 00:47:20,341
so I lit on out of there and
I haven't been back since.

602
00:47:20,540 --> 00:47:22,714
You could just call me a
tumbleweed blowing in the wind.

603
00:47:25,212 --> 00:47:29,388
Well, Rose, we've walked about
a mile around this boat deck and...

604
00:47:29,675 --> 00:47:32,679
chewed over how great the
weather's been and how I grew up...

605
00:47:32,887 --> 00:47:36,562
but I reckon that's not why
you came to talk to me, is it?

606
00:47:38,559 --> 00:47:40,561
- Mr. Dawson, I--
- Jack.

607
00:47:41,979 --> 00:47:42,980
Jack.

608
00:47:43,397 --> 00:47:46,720
I want to thank you for what you did.

609
00:47:46,820 --> 00:47:51,410
Not just for pulling me back,
but for your discretion.

610
00:47:51,739 --> 00:47:53,082
You're welcome.

611
00:47:53,574 --> 00:47:54,575
Look.

612
00:47:55,659 --> 00:47:58,333
I know what you must be thinking.

613
00:47:58,579 --> 00:48:00,320
Poor little rich girl.

614
00:48:00,420 --> 00:48:02,500
What does she know about misery?

615
00:48:02,750 --> 00:48:03,751
No.

616
00:48:04,752 --> 00:48:06,925
No, that's not what I was thinking.

617
00:48:07,254 --> 00:48:08,620
What I was thinking was...

618
00:48:08,720 --> 00:48:12,097
what could have happened to this girl
to make her think she had no way out?

619
00:48:14,762 --> 00:48:15,763
Well I...

620
00:48:16,514 --> 00:48:20,564
It was everything. It was my whole world and...

621
00:48:20,768 --> 00:48:21,860
all the people in it.

622
00:48:22,520 --> 00:48:25,694
And the inertia of my life,
plunging ahead and me...

623
00:48:25,898 --> 00:48:27,741
powerless to stop it

624
00:48:27,942 --> 00:48:29,944
God, look at that thing.

625
00:48:30,236 --> 00:48:32,409
You would have gone straight to the bottom.

626
00:48:34,114 --> 00:48:36,617
Five hundred invitations have gone out.

627
00:48:36,950 --> 00:48:39,625
All of Philadelphia society will be there.

628
00:48:39,912 --> 00:48:41,914
And all the while I feel I'm...

629
00:48:42,289 --> 00:48:44,220
standing in the middle of a crowded room...

630
00:48:44,320 --> 00:48:46,020
screaming at the top of my lungs...

631
00:48:46,030 --> 00:48:47,302
and no one even looks up.

632
00:48:49,129 --> 00:48:50,130
Do you love him?

633
00:48:51,465 --> 00:48:52,466
Pardon me?

634
00:48:52,800 --> 00:48:54,268
Do you love him?

635
00:48:54,802 --> 00:48:57,806
You're being very rude. You
shouldn't be asking me this.

636
00:48:58,264 --> 00:49:00,813
Well, it's a simple question.
Do you love the guy or not?

637
00:49:03,269 --> 00:49:05,317
This is not a suitable conversation.

638
00:49:05,604 --> 00:49:06,821
Why can't you just answer the question?

639
00:49:09,483 --> 00:49:11,451
This is absurd.

640
00:49:12,069 --> 00:49:13,161
You don't know me and I don't know you...

641
00:49:13,445 --> 00:49:16,449
and we are not having this
conversation at all. You are rude...

642
00:49:16,657 --> 00:49:20,002
and uncouth and presumptuous
and I am leaving now...

643
00:49:20,327 --> 00:49:23,320
Jack. Mr. Dawson. It's been a pleasure.

644
00:49:23,420 --> 00:49:25,082
I sought you out to thank you
and now I have thanked you.

645
00:49:25,290 --> 00:49:27,293
And you've insulted me.

646
00:49:27,500 --> 00:49:29,128
Well, you deserved it.

647
00:49:29,336 --> 00:49:30,508
- Right.
- Right.

648
00:49:33,507 --> 00:49:35,134
I thought you were leaving.

649
00:49:35,342 --> 00:49:36,685
I am.

650
00:49:38,846 --> 00:49:40,189
You are so annoying.

651
00:49:41,682 --> 00:49:42,683
Wail.

652
00:49:42,933 --> 00:49:47,188
I don't have to leave. This is
my part of the ship. You leave.

653
00:49:47,520 --> 00:49:50,525
Oh, ho, ho. Well, well, well.
Now who's being rude?

654
00:49:54,360 --> 00:49:57,205
What is this stupid thing you're carrying around?

655
00:49:58,365 --> 00:50:00,709
So, what are you, an artist or something?

656
00:50:04,872 --> 00:50:06,715
These are rather good.

657
00:50:10,044 --> 00:50:13,218
They're very good, actually.

658
00:50:20,554 --> 00:50:22,227
Jack, this is exquisite work.

659
00:50:22,556 --> 00:50:25,320
Ah, they didn't think too
much of them in old Paree.

660
00:50:25,420 --> 00:50:26,735
Paris?

661
00:50:28,020 --> 00:50:30,694
You do get around for a p--

662
00:50:32,399 --> 00:50:36,199
Well, a-a person of limited means.

663
00:50:36,403 --> 00:50:38,405
Go on. A poor guy, you can say it.

664
00:50:41,742 --> 00:50:43,415
Well, well, well.

665
00:50:47,748 --> 00:50:49,375
And these were drawn from life?

666
00:50:52,920 --> 00:50:54,922
Well, that's one of the good things about Paris.

667
00:50:55,422 --> 00:50:56,844
Lots of girls are willing
to take their clothes off.

668
00:51:03,389 --> 00:51:04,766
You liked this woman.

669
00:51:05,599 --> 00:51:07,772
You used her several times.

670
00:51:08,936 --> 00:51:09,937
Well.

671
00:51:10,688 --> 00:51:12,611
She had beautiful hands, you see?

672
00:51:15,109 --> 00:51:17,453
I think you must have had a love affair with her.

673
00:51:17,945 --> 00:51:19,947
No, no, no. Just with her hands

674
00:51:20,280 --> 00:51:22,954
She was a one-legged prostitute.

675
00:51:24,076 --> 00:51:25,077
See?

676
00:51:31,625 --> 00:51:33,627
She had a good sense of humor though.

677
00:51:36,130 --> 00:51:37,131
Oh, and this lady...

678
00:51:38,966 --> 00:51:42,120
She used to sit at this bar every night...

679
00:51:42,130 --> 00:51:43,809
wearing every piece of jewelry she owned...

680
00:51:44,054 --> 00:51:46,398
just waiting for her long, lost love.

681
00:51:47,140 --> 00:51:49,485
We called her Madame Bijoux.

682
00:51:49,977 --> 00:51:51,820
See, her clothes are all moth-eaten.

683
00:51:53,480 --> 00:51:56,324
Well, you have a gift, Jack.

684
00:51:56,650 --> 00:51:57,993
You do.

685
00:51:58,318 --> 00:51:59,820
You see people.

686
00:52:00,112 --> 00:52:01,659
I see you.

687
00:52:04,074 --> 00:52:05,417
And?

688
00:52:06,785 --> 00:52:08,503
You wouldn't have jumped.

689
00:52:12,833 --> 00:52:16,463
But the purpose of university
is to find a suitable husband.

690
00:52:16,670 --> 00:52:18,343
Rose has already done that.

691
00:52:18,672 --> 00:52:21,516
Look, here comes that vulgar Brown woman.

692
00:52:21,842 --> 00:52:24,516
Quickly, get up before she sits with us.

693
00:52:25,512 --> 00:52:28,140
Hello, girls. I was hoping I'd catch you at tea.

694
00:52:28,348 --> 00:52:29,920
We're awfully sorry, you missed it.

695
00:52:30,020 --> 00:52:33,442
The Countess and I were just
off to take the air on the boat deck.

696
00:52:33,645 --> 00:52:36,694
What a lovely idea.
I need to catch up on my gossip.

697
00:52:40,194 --> 00:52:41,366
Countess.

698
00:52:42,863 --> 00:52:45,707
So, you've not yet lit the last four boilers?

699
00:52:46,200 --> 00:52:47,668
No, I don't see the need.

700
00:52:48,494 --> 00:52:49,541
We are making excellent time.

701
00:52:51,038 --> 00:52:55,384
The press knows the size of Titanic.
Now, I want them to marvel at her speed.

702
00:52:55,667 --> 00:52:57,886
We must give them something new to print.

703
00:52:59,880 --> 00:53:01,882
This maiden voyage of Titanic must...

704
00:53:02,382 --> 00:53:03,975
make headlines.

705
00:53:04,218 --> 00:53:08,223
Mr. Ismay, I would prefer
not to push the engines...

706
00:53:08,555 --> 00:53:11,058
until they've been properly run in.

707
00:53:12,392 --> 00:53:13,720
Of course I'm just a passenger.

708
00:53:13,820 --> 00:53:16,150
I leave it to your good offices
to decide what's best.

709
00:53:16,730 --> 00:53:19,520
But what a glorious end to your final crossing...

710
00:53:19,620 --> 00:53:21,159
if we were to get into
New York on Tuesday night...

711
00:53:21,360 --> 00:53:23,909
and surprise them all. Make the morning papers.

712
00:53:24,696 --> 00:53:26,698
Retire with a bang, eh, E.J.?

713
00:53:30,410 --> 00:53:31,753
Good man.

714
00:53:33,163 --> 00:53:35,666
After that, I worked
on a squid boat in Monterey...

715
00:53:36,083 --> 00:53:38,586
then I went to Los Angeles to the...

716
00:53:38,836 --> 00:53:42,010
Santa Monica pier and did
portraits for ten cents each.

717
00:53:42,756 --> 00:53:44,599
Why can't I be like you?

718
00:53:44,925 --> 00:53:48,429
Just head out for the horizon
whenever I feel like it.

719
00:53:50,430 --> 00:53:53,183
Say we'll go there sometime, to that pier...

720
00:53:53,433 --> 00:53:55,606
even if we only ever just talk about it.

721
00:53:55,936 --> 00:53:58,780
No, we'll do it. We'll drink cheap beer.

722
00:53:59,106 --> 00:54:01,780
Ride on the roller coaster till we throw up.

723
00:54:02,109 --> 00:54:05,283
We'll ride horses on the beach, in the surf.

724
00:54:05,612 --> 00:54:09,617
But you have to do it like a real cowboy.
No sidesaddle stuff.

725
00:54:10,117 --> 00:54:12,791
You mean with one leg on each side?

726
00:54:14,120 --> 00:54:15,122
Can you show me?

727
00:54:15,372 --> 00:54:17,215
Sure, if you like.

728
00:54:18,792 --> 00:54:20,465
Teach me to ride like a man.

729
00:54:20,710 --> 00:54:22,054
Chew tobacco like a man.

730
00:54:23,630 --> 00:54:25,803
And spit like a man.

731
00:54:26,133 --> 00:54:27,885
You didn't learn in finishing school?

732
00:54:28,135 --> 00:54:29,307
No.

733
00:54:29,636 --> 00:54:31,479
Come on, I'll show you.

734
00:54:32,472 --> 00:54:33,473
I'll show you how.

735
00:54:33,724 --> 00:54:36,648
Jack! No, Jack, no. Wait.

736
00:54:37,978 --> 00:54:39,980
I couldn't possibly, Jack.

737
00:54:40,314 --> 00:54:41,987
Watch closely.

738
00:54:43,650 --> 00:54:45,620
That's disgusting.

739
00:54:45,720 --> 00:54:46,653
Your turn.

740
00:54:48,989 --> 00:54:51,993
That was pitiful.
You really have to hawk it back.

741
00:54:52,326 --> 00:54:55,330
Get some leverage. Use your arms. Arc your neck.

742
00:54:56,663 --> 00:54:58,665
You see the range on that thing?

743
00:54:59,499 --> 00:55:00,671
Okay, go.

744
00:55:04,170 --> 00:55:09,177
That was better. You have to
work on it. Really try to hawk it up.

745
00:55:17,100 --> 00:55:18,443
Mother.

746
00:55:23,857 --> 00:55:26,201
May I introduce Jack Dawson?

747
00:55:27,360 --> 00:55:29,204
Charmed, I'm sure.

748
00:55:33,867 --> 00:55:38,543
The others were gracious and curious
about the man who'd saved my life.

749
00:55:39,706 --> 00:55:42,710
But my mother looked at him like an insect.

750
00:55:43,210 --> 00:55:47,215
A dangerous insect which
must be squashed quickly.

751
00:55:47,547 --> 00:55:51,393
Sounds like you're a good man
to have around in a sticky spot.

752
00:55:54,388 --> 00:55:59,064
Why do they always insist on announcing
dinner like a damn cavalry charge?

753
00:55:59,393 --> 00:56:01,066
Shall we go dress, Mother?

754
00:56:02,062 --> 00:56:03,905
See you at dinner, Jack.

755
00:56:05,899 --> 00:56:06,900
Uh, son?

756
00:56:07,400 --> 00:56:08,573
Son!

757
00:56:09,069 --> 00:56:11,413
Do you have any idea what you're doing?

758
00:56:12,406 --> 00:56:13,407
Not really.

759
00:56:13,740 --> 00:56:16,243
You're about to go into the snake pit

760
00:56:18,662 --> 00:56:20,335
What are you going to wear?

761
00:56:23,417 --> 00:56:25,419
I figured. Come on.

762
00:56:28,088 --> 00:56:32,434
I was right. You and my son
are just about the same size.

763
00:56:32,759 --> 00:56:34,432
Pretty close.

764
00:56:38,098 --> 00:56:40,442
You shine up like a new penny.

765
00:56:52,279 --> 00:56:53,952
Good evening, sir.

766
00:57:58,260 --> 00:58:01,014
Thousands of tons of
Hockley steel are in this ship.

767
00:58:01,264 --> 00:58:03,358
- Which part?
- All the right ones.

768
00:58:03,600 --> 00:58:06,774
Then you're accountable if
there's a problem. Where's Rose?

769
00:58:07,020 --> 00:58:08,363
She'll be along.

770
00:58:08,688 --> 00:58:10,690
There is the Countess.

771
00:58:39,553 --> 00:58:43,057
I saw that in a nickelodeon
and always wanted to do it.

772
00:58:57,487 --> 00:58:58,659
Darling...

773
00:58:59,239 --> 00:59:01,412
surely you remember Mr. Dawson.

774
00:59:04,244 --> 00:59:07,839
It's amazing. You could
almost pass for a gentleman.

775
00:59:09,082 --> 00:59:10,254
Almost.

776
00:59:10,584 --> 00:59:12,006
This is extraordinary.

777
00:59:26,600 --> 00:59:28,273
This is a remarkable voyage.

778
00:59:28,518 --> 00:59:29,940
- Mad.
- Completely lunatic.

779
00:59:31,688 --> 00:59:33,690
There's the Countess of Rothes.

780
00:59:35,775 --> 00:59:38,779
That's John Jacob Astor...

781
00:59:39,446 --> 00:59:41,119
the richest man on board.

782
00:59:41,364 --> 00:59:45,289
His little wifey, Madeleine,
is my age and in a delicate condition.

783
00:59:46,119 --> 00:59:48,121
See how she tries to hide it.

784
00:59:48,370 --> 00:59:49,793
Quite the scandal.

785
00:59:50,290 --> 00:59:54,796
Benjamin Guggenheim and his mistress,
Madame Aubert. Mrs. Guggenheim...

786
00:59:55,045 --> 00:59:58,720
is at home with the children,
of course. And over here...

787
00:59:58,965 --> 01:00:00,638
Sir Cosmo and Lucile, Lady Duff-Gordon.

788
01:00:00,884 --> 01:00:04,229
She designs naughty lingerie,
among her many talents.

789
01:00:04,470 --> 01:00:06,815
Very popular with the royals

790
01:00:07,807 --> 01:00:09,650
Congratulations. She's splendid.

791
01:00:09,976 --> 01:00:11,478
Why, thank you.

792
01:00:12,312 --> 01:00:13,734
Escort a lady to dinner?

793
01:00:13,980 --> 01:00:15,482
Certainly.

794
01:00:16,816 --> 01:00:18,818
Sweet pea, sweet pea.

795
01:00:19,653 --> 01:00:21,075
Ain't nothing to it.

796
01:00:21,820 --> 01:00:26,327
They love money. Pretend like you own
a gold mine and you're in the club.

797
01:00:28,495 --> 01:00:30,168
Hey, Astor.

798
01:00:30,997 --> 01:00:33,671
Hello, Molly. Nice to see you.

799
01:00:33,917 --> 01:00:36,841
J.J., Madeleine, I'd like you to meet Jack Dawson.

800
01:00:38,255 --> 01:00:39,598
Well, Jack...

801
01:00:40,006 --> 01:00:41,679
are you of the Boston Dawsons?

802
01:00:42,676 --> 01:00:45,270
No, the Chippewa Falls Dawsons, actually.

803
01:00:45,512 --> 01:00:46,855
Oh, yes.

804
01:00:48,848 --> 01:00:52,853
He must have been nervous,
but he never faltered.

805
01:00:53,687 --> 01:00:55,860
They assumed he was one of them.

806
01:00:56,189 --> 01:00:59,363
Heir to a railroad fortune, perhaps.

807
01:00:59,693 --> 01:01:03,869
New money, obviously,
but still a member of the club.

808
01:01:04,530 --> 01:01:07,956
Mother, of course,
could always be counted upon.

809
01:01:08,535 --> 01:01:13,462
Tell us of the accommodations in steerage,
Mr. Dawson. I hear they're quite good.

810
01:01:14,958 --> 01:01:18,132
The best I've seen, ma'am. Hardly any rats.

811
01:01:21,214 --> 01:01:24,058
Mr. Dawson is joining us from third class.

812
01:01:24,300 --> 01:01:26,645
He was of help to my fiancée last night.

813
01:01:26,886 --> 01:01:29,730
It happens Mr. Dawson is quite a fine artist.

814
01:01:30,056 --> 01:01:32,559
He showed me some of his work today.

815
01:01:33,059 --> 01:01:37,906
Rose and I differ in our definition of
fine art. Not to impugn your work, sir.

816
01:01:48,742 --> 01:01:49,743
Are all these mine?

817
01:01:49,993 --> 01:01:52,087
Start from the outside and work in.

818
01:01:52,329 --> 01:01:54,331
He knows every rivet in her.

819
01:01:54,580 --> 01:01:56,925
Your ship is a wonder, Mr. Andrews.

820
01:01:57,167 --> 01:01:58,510
Thank you, Rose.

821
01:02:01,670 --> 01:02:03,264
How do you take your caviar, sir?

822
01:02:03,506 --> 01:02:06,760
No caviar for me, thanks. Never did like it much.

823
01:02:08,595 --> 01:02:11,269
Where exactly do you live, Mr. Dawson?

824
01:02:11,680 --> 01:02:14,685
Right now, my address is the RMS Titanic.

825
01:02:14,934 --> 01:02:16,936
After that, I'm on God's good humor

826
01:02:17,437 --> 01:02:19,360
How do you have means to travel?

827
01:02:20,273 --> 01:02:24,449
I work my way from place to place.
Tramp steamers and such.

828
01:02:24,778 --> 01:02:28,453
I won my ticket on Titanic
at a lucky hand at poker.

829
01:02:28,698 --> 01:02:30,200
A very lucky hand.

830
01:02:31,117 --> 01:02:33,119
All life is a game of luck.

831
01:02:34,287 --> 01:02:37,211
A real man makes his own luck. Right, Dawson?

832
01:02:38,875 --> 01:02:42,721
And you find that sort of
rootless existence appealing?

833
01:02:45,799 --> 01:02:47,392
Yes, ma'am, I do.

834
01:02:48,134 --> 01:02:51,138
I've got everything I need right here with me.

835
01:02:51,388 --> 01:02:54,232
I have air in my lungs and blank sheets of paper.

836
01:02:55,642 --> 01:03:00,068
I love waking up, not knowing
what will happen or who I'll meet.

837
01:03:00,980 --> 01:03:02,402
Where I'll wind up.

838
01:03:02,816 --> 01:03:05,069
One night I'm sleeping under a bridge...

839
01:03:05,318 --> 01:03:09,573
now I'm on the grandest ship
in the world, with you fine people.

840
01:03:09,823 --> 01:03:10,824
I'll take more of that.

841
01:03:12,158 --> 01:03:15,162
Life's a gift. I don't intend on wasting it.

842
01:03:16,496 --> 01:03:18,999
You never know what hand you'll get dealt.

843
01:03:19,332 --> 01:03:22,006
You take life as it comes at you. Here, Cal.

844
01:03:24,587 --> 01:03:26,260
Make each day count.

845
01:03:27,090 --> 01:03:28,091
Well said, Jack.

846
01:03:28,340 --> 01:03:29,433
Hear, hear.

847
01:03:30,427 --> 01:03:32,020
To making it count.

848
01:03:33,680 --> 01:03:35,353
To making it count.

849
01:03:35,849 --> 01:03:36,850
Bravo.

850
01:03:43,773 --> 01:03:47,528
But Mr. Brown didn't know
I'd hidden the money in the stove

851
01:03:48,862 --> 01:03:52,867
He comes home drunk as a pig
celebrating and lights a fire.

852
01:03:56,369 --> 01:03:58,542
Next is brandy in the smoking room.

853
01:04:00,707 --> 01:04:02,801
Join me in a brandy, gentlemen?

854
01:04:04,710 --> 01:04:09,137
Now they retreat to congratulate each
other on being masters of the universe.

855
01:04:09,382 --> 01:04:11,384
Ladies, thank you for your company.

856
01:04:12,469 --> 01:04:14,142
May I escort you to the cabin?

857
01:04:14,387 --> 01:04:15,388
No, I'll stay here.

858
01:04:16,222 --> 01:04:17,223
Here, Molly.

859
01:04:18,224 --> 01:04:20,226
Joining us, Dawson?

860
01:04:20,560 --> 01:04:22,904
You don't want to stay with the women.

861
01:04:23,396 --> 01:04:25,740
No, thanks. I have to head back.

862
01:04:26,065 --> 01:04:30,741
That's best. It'll be all business
and politics. Wouldn't interest you.

863
01:04:31,820 --> 01:04:34,495
But Dawson, good of you to come.

864
01:04:40,079 --> 01:04:41,422
Must you go?

865
01:04:41,664 --> 01:04:44,008
Time for me to row with the other slaves.

866
01:04:47,587 --> 01:04:48,930
Good night, Rose.

867
01:05:28,962 --> 01:05:31,465
Want to go to a real party?

868
01:05:41,890 --> 01:05:44,064
Is okay I put my hand here?

869
01:06:03,663 --> 01:06:05,665
I can't understand you.

870
01:06:37,947 --> 01:06:40,420
I'm going to dance with her now.

871
01:06:40,520 --> 01:06:41,451
Come on.

872
01:06:42,035 --> 01:06:44,037
Come on. Come with me.

873
01:06:44,370 --> 01:06:46,213
Jack! Jack, wait!

874
01:06:48,540 --> 01:06:49,542
I can't do this.

875
01:06:49,792 --> 01:06:51,635
We'll have to get a bit closer.

876
01:06:51,878 --> 01:06:53,050
Like this.

877
01:06:56,382 --> 01:06:58,055
You're still my best girl, Cora.

878
01:07:01,304 --> 01:07:04,478
- I don't know the steps-
- Me, either. Just go with it

879
01:07:04,890 --> 01:07:06,313
Don't think.

880
01:07:25,410 --> 01:07:28,085
Wait! Jack! Wait! Stop, Jack!

881
01:07:37,924 --> 01:07:39,426
What? Wait!

882
01:08:20,633 --> 01:08:22,306
Jack, no.

883
01:08:28,140 --> 01:08:31,816
Beyond the jurisdiction of the Sherman Act.

884
01:08:32,145 --> 01:08:35,900
That's what Rockefeller said.
Supreme Court has not swallowed it.

885
01:08:56,169 --> 01:08:59,844
What? You think a first-class girl can't drink?

886
01:09:02,090 --> 01:09:03,092
Get out of here.

887
01:09:03,676 --> 01:09:05,019
Are you all right?

888
01:09:07,013 --> 01:09:08,014
I'm fine.

889
01:09:08,264 --> 01:09:10,266
Two out of three.

890
01:09:11,184 --> 01:09:12,527
So...

891
01:09:13,686 --> 01:09:15,688
you think you're tough?

892
01:09:17,023 --> 01:09:18,525
Let's see you do this.

893
01:09:20,860 --> 01:09:23,534
Hold this for me, Jack. Hold it up.

894
01:09:41,214 --> 01:09:42,306
Jesus!

895
01:09:42,548 --> 01:09:43,720
You okay?

896
01:09:43,966 --> 01:09:45,559
I haven't done that in years.

897
01:09:53,643 --> 01:09:56,396
Come on, lads. Give it all you got. Let's go.

898
01:10:22,420 --> 01:10:23,764
Coffee, sir?

899
01:10:33,683 --> 01:10:35,356
You didn't come to me last night.

900
01:10:37,603 --> 01:10:39,105
I was tired.

901
01:10:41,607 --> 01:10:44,281
Your exertions below deck
were no doubt exhausting.

902
01:10:47,446 --> 01:10:50,950
I see you had that undertaker
of a manservant follow me.

903
01:10:51,284 --> 01:10:54,208
You will never behave like that again.

904
01:10:57,790 --> 01:11:00,794
I'm not one of your mill foremen
who you can command.

905
01:11:02,295 --> 01:11:03,968
I'm your fiancée.

906
01:11:05,630 --> 01:11:07,633
My fiancée. My fiancée!

907
01:11:07,967 --> 01:11:09,969
Yes, you are! And my wife!

908
01:11:11,304 --> 01:11:15,810
My wife in practice,
if not yet by law, so you will honor me!

909
01:11:16,142 --> 01:11:18,895
You will honor me the way
a wife honors her husband.

910
01:11:19,145 --> 01:11:21,398
Because I will not be made a fool of.

911
01:11:22,230 --> 01:11:24,074
Is this in any way unclear?

912
01:11:24,984 --> 01:11:26,156
No.

913
01:11:26,485 --> 01:11:28,829
Good. Excuse me.

914
01:11:34,493 --> 01:11:36,166
Oh, Miss Rose.

915
01:11:37,830 --> 01:11:39,423
We had a little accident.

916
01:11:39,665 --> 01:11:41,838
- That's all right.
- I'm sorry.

917
01:11:42,250 --> 01:11:43,252
Let me help you.

918
01:11:43,502 --> 01:11:45,175
It's all right, miss.

919
01:11:51,677 --> 01:11:53,099
It's all right, miss.

920
01:11:58,684 --> 01:12:00,027
Tea, Trudy.

921
01:12:17,536 --> 01:12:20,710
You're not to see that boy again.
You understand?

922
01:12:22,040 --> 01:12:24,385
Rose, I forbid it.

923
01:12:25,378 --> 01:12:28,382
Stop it, Mother.
You'll give yourself a nosebleed.

924
01:12:28,714 --> 01:12:30,387
This is not a game.

925
01:12:30,967 --> 01:12:34,562
Our situation is precarious.
You know the money's gone.

926
01:12:34,887 --> 01:12:39,233
Of course I know. You remind me every day.

927
01:12:40,309 --> 01:12:45,156
Your father left us nothing but a legacy
of bad debts hidden by a good name-

928
01:12:45,398 --> 01:12:48,072
That name is the only card we have to play.

929
01:12:48,734 --> 01:12:50,407
I don't understand you.

930
01:12:51,070 --> 01:12:55,075
It is a fine match with Hockley.
It will ensure our survival.

931
01:12:56,409 --> 01:12:58,082
How can you put this on me?

932
01:12:58,327 --> 01:12:59,829
Why are you being so selfish?

933
01:13:00,329 --> 01:13:02,172
I'm being selfish?

934
01:13:05,668 --> 01:13:08,592
Do you want to see me working as a seamstress?

935
01:13:10,423 --> 01:13:12,266
Is that what you want?

936
01:13:14,927 --> 01:13:17,771
To see our fine things sold at auction?

937
01:13:19,432 --> 01:13:21,275
Our memories scattered?

938
01:13:32,445 --> 01:13:34,118
It's so unfair.

939
01:13:35,448 --> 01:13:37,291
Of course it's unfair.

940
01:13:38,617 --> 01:13:39,960
We're women.

941
01:13:42,455 --> 01:13:44,628
Our choices are never easy.

942
01:14:06,479 --> 01:14:10,325
Protect them by Thy guiding hand

943
01:14:10,649 --> 01:14:15,496
From every peril on the land

944
01:14:17,490 --> 01:14:21,495
O, spirit whom the Father sent

945
01:14:22,160 --> 01:14:26,337
To spread abroad the firmament

946
01:14:26,665 --> 01:14:31,011
O, wind of heaven, by Thy might

947
01:14:31,337 --> 01:14:36,184
Save all who dare the eagle's flight

948
01:14:36,509 --> 01:14:40,355
And keep them by Thy watchful care...

949
01:14:43,015 --> 01:14:44,688
Hello, Mr. Andrews.

950
01:14:54,944 --> 01:14:56,366
I need to talk to someone.

951
01:14:56,612 --> 01:14:58,865
You're not supposed to be in here.

952
01:15:03,536 --> 01:15:05,129
I was here last night, remember?

953
01:15:05,370 --> 01:15:07,044
No. Now please turn around.

954
01:15:07,289 --> 01:15:10,133
He'll tell you. I just need to talk-

955
01:15:10,376 --> 01:15:13,550
Mr. Hockley and Mrs. DeWitt Bukater...

956
01:15:13,879 --> 01:15:16,723
are still appreciative of your assistance.

957
01:15:17,049 --> 01:15:20,553
They asked me to give you this in gratitude.

958
01:15:20,803 --> 01:15:22,396
I don't want your money.

959
01:15:22,720 --> 01:15:26,567
And remind you you are in
third class and your presence here...

960
01:15:26,809 --> 01:15:28,561
is no longer appropriate.

961
01:15:28,810 --> 01:15:30,154
Let me speak to Rose.

962
01:15:30,396 --> 01:15:34,401
Gentlemen, please see Mr. Dawson
returns to where he belongs...

963
01:15:34,733 --> 01:15:36,406
and that he stays there?

964
01:15:37,236 --> 01:15:38,237
Yes, sir.

965
01:15:38,487 --> 01:15:39,659
Come along, you.

966
01:15:41,740 --> 01:15:44,914
Hear us when we cry to Thee

967
01:15:45,244 --> 01:15:49,750
For those in peril on the sea

968
01:15:50,749 --> 01:15:52,592
Why are there two steering wheels?

969
01:15:52,835 --> 01:15:54,337
We use this one near shore.

970
01:15:54,587 --> 01:15:58,262
Excuse me, sir. Another
ice warning, from the Nuordam.

971
01:15:58,507 --> 01:15:59,850
Thank you, Sparks.

972
01:16:02,094 --> 01:16:05,439
Not to worry. Quite normal for this time of year.

973
01:16:06,432 --> 01:16:10,437
In fact, we're speeding up.
I've ordered the last boilers lit.

974
01:16:14,480 --> 01:16:17,451
Okay, son, wind it up tight
like I showed you. That's right.

975
01:16:17,650 --> 01:16:19,278
Okay, now let it go.

976
01:16:22,323 --> 01:16:24,325
- It was good, wasn't it?
- Quite nice. That's excellent.

977
01:16:31,332 --> 01:16:34,336
Mr. Andrews...Forgive me.

978
01:16:34,960 --> 01:16:36,382
I did the sum in my head...

979
01:16:37,004 --> 01:16:40,508
and with the number of lifeboats
times the capacity you mentioned...

980
01:16:40,840 --> 01:16:44,345
Forgive me, but it seems that there are
not enough for everyone aboard.

981
01:16:45,137 --> 01:16:46,855
About half, actually.

982
01:16:47,680 --> 01:16:49,183
Rose, you miss nothing, do you?

983
01:16:50,017 --> 01:16:52,190
In fact, I put in these new type davits...

984
01:16:52,519 --> 01:16:55,147
which can take an extra row
of boats inside this one.

985
01:16:55,856 --> 01:16:57,920
But it was thought, by some...

986
01:16:58,020 --> 01:16:59,576
the deck would look too cluttered.

987
01:17:00,027 --> 01:17:02,371
So, I was overruled.

988
01:17:02,863 --> 01:17:05,867
It's a waste of deck space
as it is on an unsinkable ship.

989
01:17:06,200 --> 01:17:07,920
Sleep soundly, young Rose.

990
01:17:08,020 --> 01:17:10,587
I have built you a good ship, strong and true.

991
01:17:10,870 --> 01:17:12,544
She's all the lifeboat you need.

992
01:17:12,873 --> 01:17:15,877
Just keep heading aft.
The next stop will be the engine room.

993
01:17:21,215 --> 01:17:25,561
Jack, this is impossible. I can't see you.

994
01:17:25,844 --> 01:17:28,723
- I need to talk to you.
- No, Jack. No.

995
01:17:30,224 --> 01:17:32,568
Jack. I'm engaged.

996
01:17:33,560 --> 01:17:35,403
I'm marrying Cal.

997
01:17:36,230 --> 01:17:37,356
I love Cal.

998
01:17:39,900 --> 01:17:41,243
Rose...

999
01:17:41,735 --> 01:17:46,241
you're no picnic. All right?
You're a spoiled little brat even.

1000
01:17:46,573 --> 01:17:51,079
But under that, you're the
most amazingly, astounding--

1001
01:17:51,412 --> 01:17:53,085
wonderful girl...

1002
01:17:53,706 --> 01:17:55,620
woman, that I've ever known.

1003
01:17:55,720 --> 01:17:56,720
Jack, I--

1004
01:17:56,820 --> 01:17:59,469
No, let me try and get this out. You're ama--

1005
01:18:01,922 --> 01:18:04,926
I'm not an idiot. I know how the world works.

1006
01:18:05,259 --> 01:18:07,220
I've got ten bucks in my pocket.

1007
01:18:07,320 --> 01:18:10,060
I have nothing to offer you and I know that.

1008
01:18:10,264 --> 01:18:11,937
I understand.

1009
01:18:12,890 --> 01:18:14,564
But I'm too involved now.

1010
01:18:14,935 --> 01:18:16,937
You jump, I jump. Remember?

1011
01:18:17,270 --> 01:18:19,774
I can't tum away without
knowing you'll be all right.

1012
01:18:21,567 --> 01:18:22,568
That's all that I want.

1013
01:18:23,944 --> 01:18:25,446
Well, I'm fine.

1014
01:18:26,613 --> 01:18:29,116
I'll be fine, really.

1015
01:18:30,117 --> 01:18:31,289
Really?

1016
01:18:33,454 --> 01:18:34,956
I don't think so.

1017
01:18:35,956 --> 01:18:38,220
They've got you trapped, Rose.

1018
01:18:38,320 --> 01:18:39,720
And you're gonna die if you don't break free.

1019
01:18:39,820 --> 01:18:40,820
Maybe not right away...

1020
01:18:40,920 --> 01:18:42,592
because you're strong...

1021
01:18:43,964 --> 01:18:47,309
but sooner or later that fire
that I love about you, Rose,

1022
01:18:47,634 --> 01:18:50,137
that fire is gonna burn out.

1023
01:18:54,975 --> 01:18:56,773
It's not up to you to save me, Jack.

1024
01:18:59,270 --> 01:19:00,488
You're right.

1025
01:19:01,815 --> 01:19:03,488
Only you can do that.

1026
01:19:09,490 --> 01:19:10,992
I'm going back.

1027
01:19:11,325 --> 01:19:12,827
Leave me alone.

1028
01:19:24,338 --> 01:19:27,512
Tell Lucile about the disaster
you had with the stationers-

1029
01:19:27,800 --> 01:19:30,474
Well, of course the invitations
had to be sent back, twice.

1030
01:19:30,677 --> 01:19:31,849
Oh, my dear.

1031
01:19:32,137 --> 01:19:33,720
And the dreadful bridesmaids' gowns.

1032
01:19:33,820 --> 01:19:36,150
Let me tell you what an odyssey that has been.

1033
01:19:36,350 --> 01:19:38,648
Rose decided she wanted lavender.

1034
01:19:39,395 --> 01:19:40,567
She knows I detest the color.

1035
01:19:41,020 --> 01:19:42,318
So, she did it only to spite me.

1036
01:19:42,523 --> 01:19:44,525
If only you'd come to me sooner.

1037
01:19:44,817 --> 01:19:47,661
Ruth saw some of my designs in La Mode Illustrée.

1038
01:19:47,860 --> 01:19:51,320
They were for the trousseau of the
Duchess of Marlborough's youngest daughter.

1039
01:19:51,420 --> 01:19:52,320
They were quite charming.

1040
01:19:52,420 --> 01:19:54,410
But, I think you'll agree,
my dear, that together...

1041
01:19:54,700 --> 01:19:57,875
we've created something
of a phoenix from the ashes.

1042
01:20:12,678 --> 01:20:13,679
Hello, Jack.

1043
01:20:19,393 --> 01:20:21,236
I changed my mind.

1044
01:20:27,192 --> 01:20:28,409
They said you might be up here.

1045
01:20:31,405 --> 01:20:32,748
Give me your hand.

1046
01:20:40,247 --> 01:20:41,590
Now close your eyes.

1047
01:20:42,916 --> 01:20:44,259
Go on.

1048
01:20:47,588 --> 01:20:49,090
Now, step up.

1049
01:20:52,926 --> 01:20:54,220
Now, hold onto the railing.

1050
01:20:54,320 --> 01:20:56,305
Keep your eyes closed. Don't peek.

1051
01:20:56,555 --> 01:20:57,556
I'm not.

1052
01:20:58,932 --> 01:21:00,934
Now, step up onto the rail.

1053
01:21:04,938 --> 01:21:06,940
Hold on. Hold on.

1054
01:21:07,440 --> 01:21:09,284
Keep your eyes closed.

1055
01:21:09,776 --> 01:21:11,119
Do you trust me?

1056
01:21:11,612 --> 01:21:12,955
I trust you.

1057
01:21:22,789 --> 01:21:23,790
All right...

1058
01:21:24,166 --> 01:21:25,668
Open your eyes.

1059
01:21:32,758 --> 01:21:33,759
I'm flying.

1060
01:21:34,259 --> 01:21:35,260
Jack.

1061
01:22:00,369 --> 01:22:04,499
Come, Josephine, in my
flying machine. Going up...

1062
01:22:05,332 --> 01:22:08,677
she goes. Up she goes.

1063
01:22:56,383 --> 01:22:59,387
That was the last time Titanic ever saw daylight.

1064
01:23:00,846 --> 01:23:02,940
We're up to dusk the night of the sinking.

1065
01:23:03,765 --> 01:23:05,017
Six hours to go.

1066
01:23:05,225 --> 01:23:08,220
Incredible. There's Smith
and he's standing there and...

1067
01:23:08,320 --> 01:23:09,943
he's got the iceberg warning
in his fucking hand...

1068
01:23:10,188 --> 01:23:13,192
excuse me--his hand, and he's ordering more speed.

1069
01:23:13,400 --> 01:23:16,574
Twenty-six years of experience working against him.

1070
01:23:16,862 --> 01:23:19,020
He figures anything big enough to sink, the ship...

1071
01:23:19,120 --> 01:23:20,783
they're gonna see in time to turn.

1072
01:23:21,074 --> 01:23:23,620
But the ship's too big with too small a rudder.

1073
01:23:23,720 --> 01:23:25,750
Doesn't corner worth a damn.

1074
01:23:26,913 --> 01:23:29,257
Everything he knows is wrong.

1075
01:23:41,928 --> 01:23:45,774
It's quite proper, I assure you.
This is the sitting room.

1076
01:23:47,768 --> 01:23:49,270
- Will this light do?
- What?

1077
01:23:50,604 --> 01:23:51,947
Don't artists need good light?

1078
01:23:52,230 --> 01:23:54,449
That is true, but I'm not used to working in...

1079
01:23:55,233 --> 01:23:56,826
such horrible conditions.

1080
01:23:57,610 --> 01:23:58,954
Monet!

1081
01:23:59,780 --> 01:24:02,454
- Do you know his work?
- Of course.

1082
01:24:02,949 --> 01:24:04,792
Look at his use of color here. Isn't he great?

1083
01:24:05,077 --> 01:24:07,079
I know. It's extraordinary.

1084
01:24:09,580 --> 01:24:12,926
Cal insists on carting
this hideous thing everywhere.

1085
01:24:13,585 --> 01:24:16,259
Should we be expecting him any time soon?

1086
01:24:16,755 --> 01:24:20,100
Not as long as the cigars and brandy hold out.

1087
01:24:23,470 --> 01:24:24,471
That's nice.

1088
01:24:24,680 --> 01:24:26,523
What is it, a sapphire?

1089
01:24:27,307 --> 01:24:28,433
A diamond.

1090
01:24:29,100 --> 01:24:30,523
A very rare diamond.

1091
01:24:34,314 --> 01:24:36,942
Jack, I want you to draw me
like one of your French girls.

1092
01:24:38,318 --> 01:24:39,661
Wearing this.

1093
01:24:39,986 --> 01:24:41,158
All right.

1094
01:24:42,989 --> 01:24:44,991
Wearing only this.

1095
01:25:20,402 --> 01:25:24,202
The last thing I need is another picture
of me looking like a porcelain doll.

1096
01:25:28,160 --> 01:25:29,161
As a paying customer...

1097
01:25:32,164 --> 01:25:34,041
I expect to get what I want.

1098
01:25:51,892 --> 01:25:54,691
Over on the bed uh, the couch.

1099
01:26:03,862 --> 01:26:04,863
Come. Lie down.

1100
01:26:08,366 --> 01:26:09,868
- Tell me when it looks right.
- Keep that.

1101
01:26:10,076 --> 01:26:11,919
Put your arm back the way it was.

1102
01:26:14,580 --> 01:26:17,755
Put that other arm up,
that hand right by your face there.

1103
01:26:19,252 --> 01:26:20,253
Right.

1104
01:26:21,254 --> 01:26:23,427
Now, head down.

1105
01:26:26,050 --> 01:26:27,928
Eyes to me. Keep them on me.

1106
01:26:29,930 --> 01:26:32,103
And try to stay still.

1107
01:26:50,617 --> 01:26:52,619
So serious.

1108
01:27:33,994 --> 01:27:36,998
I believe you are blushing, Mr. Big Artiste.

1109
01:27:41,500 --> 01:27:44,345
I can't imagine Monsieur Monet blushing.

1110
01:27:45,672 --> 01:27:47,345
He does landscapes.

1111
01:27:48,008 --> 01:27:50,181
- Just relax your face.
- Sorry.

1112
01:27:50,510 --> 01:27:51,853
No laughing.

1113
01:28:22,876 --> 01:28:25,880
My heart was pounding the whole time.

1114
01:28:26,212 --> 01:28:30,217
It was the most erotic moment of my life...

1115
01:28:33,887 --> 01:28:36,231
up until then, at least.

1116
01:28:36,723 --> 01:28:38,521
So what happened next?

1117
01:28:39,392 --> 01:28:42,066
You mean, did we do it?

1118
01:28:44,564 --> 01:28:46,908
Sony to disappoint you, Mr. Bodine.

1119
01:28:47,400 --> 01:28:49,903
Jack was very professional.

1120
01:28:57,910 --> 01:28:59,083
Thank you.

1121
01:29:07,212 --> 01:29:08,555
What are you doing?

1122
01:29:09,422 --> 01:29:11,720
Will you put this back in the safe for me?

1123
01:29:23,770 --> 01:29:25,613
Gentlemen, would you excuse me.

1124
01:29:27,940 --> 01:29:29,943
None of the stewards have seen her.

1125
01:29:30,944 --> 01:29:33,820
This is absurd. It's a ship.

1126
01:29:33,920 --> 01:29:35,995
There's only so many places she could be.

1127
01:29:36,282 --> 01:29:37,955
Lovejoy, find her.

1128
01:29:55,260 --> 01:29:56,603
- Clear.
- Yes.

1129
01:29:58,304 --> 01:30:01,808
I don't think I've ever seen such a flat calm.

1130
01:30:02,308 --> 01:30:03,309
Like a mill pond.

1131
01:30:04,477 --> 01:30:06,024
Not a breath of wind.

1132
01:30:07,147 --> 01:30:10,151
It will make the bergs harder to see...

1133
01:30:10,483 --> 01:30:12,451
with no breaking water at the base.

1134
01:30:23,955 --> 01:30:25,020
Well, I'm off.

1135
01:30:25,120 --> 01:30:28,214
Maintain speed and heading, Mr. Lightoller.

1136
01:30:28,960 --> 01:30:30,212
Yes, sir.

1137
01:30:41,514 --> 01:30:43,858
It's getting cold. You look nice.

1138
01:30:44,184 --> 01:30:45,527
Miss Rose?

1139
01:30:46,019 --> 01:30:47,692
My drawings!

1140
01:31:13,713 --> 01:31:15,010
Come on!

1141
01:31:18,050 --> 01:31:19,394
Wait, wait, wait!

1142
01:31:19,719 --> 01:31:21,062
Wait, wait, wait!

1143
01:31:22,013 --> 01:31:23,560
- Go. Go. Down, down.
- Take us down, quickly. Quickly!

1144
01:31:31,189 --> 01:31:32,190
Bye.

1145
01:31:40,073 --> 01:31:41,416
Sorry.

1146
01:31:46,746 --> 01:31:48,419
- Keep going.
- Thank you, I've got it.

1147
01:31:58,716 --> 01:32:00,620
Pretty tough for a valet, this fella.

1148
01:32:00,720 --> 01:32:02,387
Seems more like a cop.

1149
01:32:02,595 --> 01:32:03,721
I think he was.

1150
01:32:04,430 --> 01:32:06,057
- Oh, shit.
- Go!

1151
01:32:10,937 --> 01:32:12,439
No, over here!

1152
01:32:12,772 --> 01:32:13,944
Quick!

1153
01:32:20,446 --> 01:32:22,119
Now what?

1154
01:32:22,407 --> 01:32:23,750
What?

1155
01:32:28,955 --> 01:32:30,628
More coal for number one, mate.

1156
01:32:30,915 --> 01:32:33,418
Hold up? What are you two doing down here?

1157
01:32:33,960 --> 01:32:34,961
You shouldn't be down here.

1158
01:32:35,295 --> 01:32:36,342
It could be dangerous!

1159
01:32:40,758 --> 01:32:41,759
Carry on!

1160
01:32:42,135 --> 01:32:44,120
Don't mind us. You're doing a great job!

1161
01:32:44,220 --> 01:32:45,681
Keep up the good work!

1162
01:33:01,988 --> 01:33:03,990
Look at what we have here, huh?

1163
01:33:22,175 --> 01:33:23,518
Thank you.

1164
01:33:35,188 --> 01:33:37,031
Where to, miss?

1165
01:33:38,190 --> 01:33:39,864
To the stars.

1166
01:33:58,878 --> 01:34:00,380
You nervous?

1167
01:34:02,840 --> 01:34:04,012
No.

1168
01:34:20,900 --> 01:34:22,902
Put your hands on me, Jack.

1169
01:34:46,926 --> 01:34:48,428
Cor! It's bloody cold.

1170
01:34:48,928 --> 01:34:52,432
You know, I can smell ice,
you know. When it's near.

1171
01:34:53,766 --> 01:34:55,109
Bollocks!

1172
01:34:55,435 --> 01:34:57,108
Well, I can, all right?

1173
01:34:57,437 --> 01:34:59,565
Did you ever find those
binoculars for the lookouts?

1174
01:34:59,772 --> 01:35:01,615
Haven't seen them since Southampton.

1175
01:35:02,275 --> 01:35:03,618
Well, I'll be on my rounds.

1176
01:35:04,569 --> 01:35:05,570
Cheerio.

1177
01:35:36,809 --> 01:35:38,152
You're trembling.

1178
01:35:40,605 --> 01:35:41,720
Don't worry.

1179
01:35:41,820 --> 01:35:43,525
I'll be all right.

1180
01:36:04,837 --> 01:36:06,680
- They ran down there.
- Right.

1181
01:36:16,432 --> 01:36:18,105
Anything missing?

1182
01:36:43,126 --> 01:36:44,969
I have a better idea.

1183
01:36:57,807 --> 01:36:58,979
Got ya!

1184
01:37:08,234 --> 01:37:11,078
Did you see those guys' faces?

1185
01:37:11,654 --> 01:37:13,497
Did you see them?

1186
01:37:19,829 --> 01:37:21,672
When the ship docks...

1187
01:37:22,999 --> 01:37:24,751
I'm getting off with you.

1188
01:37:25,835 --> 01:37:27,320
This is crazy.

1189
01:37:27,420 --> 01:37:30,180
I know. It doesn't make any sense.

1190
01:37:31,674 --> 01:37:33,176
That's why I trust it.

1191
01:37:42,185 --> 01:37:44,859
Here, look at this.

1192
01:37:45,688 --> 01:37:47,690
Look at that, would you?

1193
01:37:48,024 --> 01:37:49,526
They're warmer than we are.

1194
01:37:49,942 --> 01:37:54,288
If that's what it takes for us
to get warm, I'd rather not.

1195
01:38:06,542 --> 01:38:08,044
Bugger me!

1196
01:38:13,382 --> 01:38:14,884
Pick up, you bastards!

1197
01:38:18,554 --> 01:38:19,555
Is anyone there?!

1198
01:38:19,805 --> 01:38:20,977
Yes, what do you see?

1199
01:38:21,224 --> 01:38:22,646
Iceberg, right ahead!

1200
01:38:22,892 --> 01:38:23,984
Thank you.

1201
01:38:26,312 --> 01:38:27,420
Iceberg ahead!

1202
01:38:27,520 --> 01:38:29,482
Hard a' starboard!

1203
01:38:36,405 --> 01:38:38,658
Turn! Turn! Smartly!

1204
01:38:43,913 --> 01:38:44,914
Full astern!

1205
01:38:47,250 --> 01:38:48,422
Hard over.

1206
01:38:48,417 --> 01:38:50,090
Helm's hard over, sir.

1207
01:38:53,756 --> 01:38:55,258
Go, lads, go!

1208
01:38:57,677 --> 01:39:00,430
Bring that steam down! Bring it down!

1209
01:39:02,265 --> 01:39:05,109
Shut all the dampers! Shut them!

1210
01:39:09,939 --> 01:39:10,940
Hold it.

1211
01:39:12,775 --> 01:39:13,776
Hold it!

1212
01:39:15,194 --> 01:39:16,946
Now! Engage reversing engine!

1213
01:39:45,975 --> 01:39:47,477
Why ain't they turning?

1214
01:39:47,727 --> 01:39:48,899
Is it hard over?!

1215
01:39:49,145 --> 01:39:51,147
It is, sir. Hard over.

1216
01:39:55,150 --> 01:39:59,327
Come on, come on, come on- Turn

1217
01:40:10,499 --> 01:40:11,842
Yes.

1218
01:40:17,006 --> 01:40:18,679
It's going to hit!

1219
01:40:30,102 --> 01:40:31,604
Jesus Christ!

1220
01:40:52,375 --> 01:40:53,547
Jesus!

1221
01:40:53,793 --> 01:40:54,794
Hard to port!

1222
01:40:55,044 --> 01:40:56,387
Hard to port!

1223
01:41:06,222 --> 01:41:07,724
Get back!

1224
01:41:37,169 --> 01:41:38,512
Let's go!

1225
01:41:38,754 --> 01:41:42,099
They're closing the doors! Get out!

1226
01:41:48,597 --> 01:41:50,941
Get out the door! Go!

1227
01:41:51,267 --> 01:41:54,271
Go! Come on, lads! Go, lads, go!

1228
01:42:03,946 --> 01:42:05,619
Go! Go!

1229
01:42:06,115 --> 01:42:08,117
Out! Out!

1230
01:42:22,798 --> 01:42:24,471
Oh, my God.

1231
01:42:25,300 --> 01:42:26,644
That was a close shave.

1232
01:42:26,969 --> 01:42:29,893
Smell ice, can you? Bleedin' Christ!

1233
01:42:33,976 --> 01:42:36,820
Note the time. Enter it in the log.

1234
01:42:42,568 --> 01:42:44,241
What was that, Mr. Murdoch?

1235
01:42:45,154 --> 01:42:46,576
An iceberg, sir.

1236
01:42:47,656 --> 01:42:51,160
I put her hard to starboard, but it was too close.

1237
01:42:51,494 --> 01:42:53,667
I tried to port round it, but--

1238
01:42:53,996 --> 01:42:57,170
- Close the watertight doors.
- They're closed, sir.

1239
01:43:00,336 --> 01:43:01,508
All stop.

1240
01:43:10,846 --> 01:43:13,019
Have the carpenter sound the ship.

1241
01:43:24,693 --> 01:43:28,038
Come on, let's get the hell out of here!

1242
01:43:32,868 --> 01:43:35,712
Why have the engines stopped? I felt a shudder.

1243
01:43:35,955 --> 01:43:38,629
Not to worry. We threw a propeller blade.

1244
01:43:38,874 --> 01:43:41,718
That's the shudder you felt. Do you need anything?

1245
01:43:42,545 --> 01:43:43,637
No, thank you.

1246
01:43:48,550 --> 01:43:51,054
There's talk of an iceberg.

1247
01:43:51,303 --> 01:43:53,055
I don't see anything. Do you?

1248
01:43:55,224 --> 01:43:58,398
If this is where the rats are going, I am, too.

1249
01:44:05,400 --> 01:44:07,074
- You.
- There is no emergency.

1250
01:44:07,319 --> 01:44:10,163
- There is. I've been robbed.
- Get the Master at Arms.

1251
01:44:10,739 --> 01:44:12,412
Now, you moron!

1252
01:44:17,079 --> 01:44:18,422
Did I miss the fun?

1253
01:44:19,582 --> 01:44:23,257
- Did you see what happened?
- No- I guess it hit over there-

1254
01:44:24,420 --> 01:44:28,675
Boiler room six is flooded eight feet
and the mail hold is worse.

1255
01:44:28,924 --> 01:44:31,347
- Can you shore up?
- Not unless the pumps get ahead.

1256
01:44:31,594 --> 01:44:34,768
- Have you seen the mail hold?
- It's already underwater.

1257
01:44:35,347 --> 01:44:37,020
This is bad.

1258
01:44:39,350 --> 01:44:40,944
We should tell Mother and Cal.

1259
01:44:42,020 --> 01:44:44,115
I think they're very good, sir.

1260
01:44:46,942 --> 01:44:49,946
Don't touch anything.
I want the room photographed.

1261
01:44:54,950 --> 01:44:57,123
We've been looking for you, miss.

1262
01:45:01,957 --> 01:45:03,049
Here we go.

1263
01:45:08,964 --> 01:45:10,386
Something serious has happened.

1264
01:45:11,967 --> 01:45:13,469
Yes, it has.

1265
01:45:14,970 --> 01:45:18,395
Indeed. Two things dear to me have disappeared.

1266
01:45:18,640 --> 01:45:22,817
Now that one is back,
I know where to find the other. Search him.

1267
01:45:23,062 --> 01:45:24,905
- Take your coat off.
- Now what?

1268
01:45:26,065 --> 01:45:30,070
What are you doing?
We're in the middle of an emergency.

1269
01:45:30,319 --> 01:45:32,413
- Is this it?
- That's it.

1270
01:45:32,988 --> 01:45:34,831
This is horseshit!

1271
01:45:36,158 --> 01:45:37,501
Don't you believe it.

1272
01:45:37,826 --> 01:45:41,171
- He couldn't have.
- Easy enough for a professional.

1273
01:45:41,413 --> 01:45:43,916
I was with him the entire time.

1274
01:45:44,166 --> 01:45:47,170
Perhaps he did it while you were
putting your clothes back on, dear.

1275
01:45:48,837 --> 01:45:51,090
Real slick. They put it in my pocket.

1276
01:45:51,340 --> 01:45:54,184
- Shut up.
- It isn't even your pocket.

1277
01:45:54,426 --> 01:45:55,928
"Property of A.L. Ryerson."

1278
01:46:00,265 --> 01:46:01,767
That was reported stolen.

1279
01:46:02,017 --> 01:46:03,610
I just borrowed it.

1280
01:46:03,852 --> 01:46:06,196
Oh, we have an honest thief.

1281
01:46:06,522 --> 01:46:08,695
You know I didn't do this, Rose.

1282
01:46:09,525 --> 01:46:11,527
Don't believe them. You know it.

1283
01:46:11,777 --> 01:46:12,778
Let's go, son.

1284
01:46:13,028 --> 01:46:14,871
You know I didn't do it!

1285
01:46:15,197 --> 01:46:18,201
There's a good lad. Come on.

1286
01:46:18,534 --> 01:46:20,878
You know I didn't do it! You know me!

1287
01:46:22,788 --> 01:46:25,041
This is most unfortunate, Captain.

1288
01:46:28,544 --> 01:46:31,969
Water fourteen feet above
the keel in ten minutes...

1289
01:46:32,214 --> 01:46:35,559
in the forepeak,
all three holds and boiler room six.

1290
01:46:35,800 --> 01:46:36,802
That's right.

1291
01:46:37,052 --> 01:46:38,395
When can we get underway?

1292
01:46:38,637 --> 01:46:40,639
That's five compartments.

1293
01:46:42,558 --> 01:46:46,563
She can float with four
compartments breached, but not five.

1294
01:46:47,229 --> 01:46:50,904
Not five. As she goes down,
the water will spill...

1295
01:46:51,150 --> 01:46:55,326
over the tops of the bulkheads
at E deck, one to the next...

1296
01:46:55,570 --> 01:46:58,245
back and back. There's no stopping it.

1297
01:46:58,574 --> 01:46:59,826
The pumps--

1298
01:47:00,075 --> 01:47:03,249
The pumps buy you time, but minutes only.

1299
01:47:03,912 --> 01:47:06,165
As of now, no matter what we do...

1300
01:47:07,082 --> 01:47:09,255
Titanic will founder.

1301
01:47:11,587 --> 01:47:12,930
But this ship cannot sink.

1302
01:47:13,172 --> 01:47:16,016
She's made of iron. I assure you, she can.

1303
01:47:16,592 --> 01:47:17,593
And she will.

1304
01:47:18,427 --> 01:47:20,521
It's a mathematical certainty

1305
01:47:24,933 --> 01:47:26,435
How much time?

1306
01:47:33,942 --> 01:47:36,445
An hour. Two, at most.

1307
01:47:42,450 --> 01:47:44,545
How many aboard, Mr. Murdoch?

1308
01:47:44,953 --> 01:47:47,797
Two thousand, two hundred souls, sir.

1309
01:47:54,463 --> 01:47:57,967
Well, I believe you may
get your headlines, Mr. Ismay.

1310
01:48:15,484 --> 01:48:17,657
Oh, it is a little slut, isn't it?

1311
01:48:18,487 --> 01:48:20,660
Look at me when I'm talking to you!

1312
01:48:20,906 --> 01:48:23,079
- Mr. Hockley?
- Not now. We're busy.

1313
01:48:23,325 --> 01:48:26,750
You've been asked to put on
lifebelts and go to the boat deck.

1314
01:48:26,995 --> 01:48:27,996
I said, not now.

1315
01:48:28,247 --> 01:48:33,253
I'm sorry, Mr. Hockley,
but it's Captain's orders. Dress warmly.

1316
01:48:33,502 --> 01:48:35,675
It's quite cold out.

1317
01:48:36,004 --> 01:48:38,848
May I suggest topcoats and hats?

1318
01:48:39,174 --> 01:48:41,017
This is ridiculous.

1319
01:48:41,677 --> 01:48:45,352
Not to worry, miss.
I'm sure it's just a precaution.

1320
01:48:45,680 --> 01:48:47,683
Everybody up! Lifebelts on!

1321
01:48:49,350 --> 01:48:50,944
What's he on about?

1322
01:48:51,854 --> 01:48:53,697
- Put your lifebelts on!
- What is it?

1323
01:48:53,939 --> 01:48:55,282
Just put them on.

1324
01:48:56,525 --> 01:48:57,697
C.Q.D.?

1325
01:48:58,360 --> 01:48:59,532
Sir?

1326
01:49:01,196 --> 01:49:05,042
That's right, C.Q.D.
The distress call. That's our position.

1327
01:49:10,622 --> 01:49:14,877
Tell whoever responds we're going down
and need immediate assistance.

1328
01:49:24,386 --> 01:49:25,729
Blimey.

1329
01:49:35,898 --> 01:49:37,741
Keep lowering!

1330
01:49:38,066 --> 01:49:40,068
Keep lowering!

1331
01:49:43,906 --> 01:49:47,752
Steady! Make it taut! And winch out!

1332
01:49:51,580 --> 01:49:55,585
Uncover this boat! Uncover all the boats aft!

1333
01:49:55,918 --> 01:49:57,591
Release those ties!

1334
01:49:57,920 --> 01:50:00,673
Roll back that cover! Smartly now!

1335
01:50:01,256 --> 01:50:02,758
Where are the passengers?

1336
01:50:03,008 --> 01:50:06,353
They went inside. Too cold and noisy for them.

1337
01:50:06,595 --> 01:50:10,941
You there! Get down here
and help with these lines!

1338
01:50:25,113 --> 01:50:26,956
Care for a drink, sir?

1339
01:50:29,450 --> 01:50:34,378
Sonny, what's doing? You get us all
trussed up and now we're cooling our heels.

1340
01:50:34,623 --> 01:50:37,126
Sorry, ma'am. Let me go find out.

1341
01:50:37,793 --> 01:50:40,137
Nobody knows what's going on.

1342
01:50:40,379 --> 01:50:43,303
Just like the damn English.
Everything by the book.

1343
01:50:43,548 --> 01:50:46,420
No need for language, Mr. Hockley.

1344
01:50:46,520 --> 01:50:51,315
Go back and turn on the heaters in our rooms.
I want a cup of tea when I return.

1345
01:51:02,150 --> 01:51:03,151
Mr. Andrews.

1346
01:51:05,153 --> 01:51:08,498
I saw the iceberg. And I see it in your eyes.

1347
01:51:08,824 --> 01:51:10,497
Please tell me the truth.

1348
01:51:18,667 --> 01:51:20,510
The ship will sink.

1349
01:51:22,254 --> 01:51:23,255
You're certain?

1350
01:51:24,339 --> 01:51:29,186
In an hour or so, all this
will be at the bottom of the Atlantic.

1351
01:51:31,847 --> 01:51:36,193
Please, tell only who you must.
I don't want to cause a panic.

1352
01:51:36,518 --> 01:51:39,362
And get to a boat. Quickly. Don't wait.

1353
01:51:40,022 --> 01:51:43,196
You remember what I told you about the boats?

1354
01:51:45,527 --> 01:51:46,870
Yes.

1355
01:51:48,697 --> 01:51:50,199
I understand.

1356
01:51:58,206 --> 01:51:59,549
Over here, son.

1357
01:52:00,542 --> 01:52:03,716
Sir, there's a big mob at
the Second Class Purser's office.

1358
01:52:04,046 --> 01:52:05,798
Go on. I'll watch him.

1359
01:52:06,548 --> 01:52:08,550
Aye. Right.

1360
01:52:22,230 --> 01:52:27,236
Sir, Carpathia says they're making
17 knots. Full steam for them, sir.

1361
01:52:29,070 --> 01:52:30,493
She's the only one responding?

1362
01:52:30,739 --> 01:52:34,334
The only one close.
They'll be here in four hours.

1363
01:52:35,077 --> 01:52:36,750
Four hours?!

1364
01:52:41,750 --> 01:52:43,252
Thank you, Bride.

1365
01:52:47,589 --> 01:52:49,262
My God.

1366
01:52:58,767 --> 01:53:00,769
We are swung out and ready, sir.

1367
01:53:02,270 --> 01:53:06,195
Hadn't we better get the women
and children into the boats?

1368
01:53:08,110 --> 01:53:09,111
Yes.

1369
01:53:13,280 --> 01:53:16,455
Women and children first, yes.

1370
01:53:17,953 --> 01:53:19,296
Yes, sir.

1371
01:53:22,124 --> 01:53:24,798
Ladies and gentlemen, attention, please!

1372
01:53:25,293 --> 01:53:27,796
Step this way, please. That's right.

1373
01:53:28,130 --> 01:53:30,974
Come towards me. Thank you.

1374
01:53:31,967 --> 01:53:32,968
Good.

1375
01:53:33,218 --> 01:53:37,473
For the time being,
I require only women and children.

1376
01:53:37,973 --> 01:53:39,145
Right here.

1377
01:53:39,808 --> 01:53:43,813
Like the Captain said,
nice and cheery, so there's no panic.

1378
01:53:44,813 --> 01:53:46,156
"Wedding Dance."

1379
01:53:54,530 --> 01:53:57,159
Lifebelts on. Put your lifebelts on.

1380
01:53:57,492 --> 01:54:00,166
Put your lifebelts on. Lifebelt on.

1381
01:54:00,495 --> 01:54:03,499
Here, put that lifebelt on. Turn it around.

1382
01:54:08,837 --> 01:54:11,181
It isn't time to go to the boats yet!

1383
01:54:11,506 --> 01:54:13,179
Please, stay calm.

1384
01:54:13,508 --> 01:54:16,682
Make sure you have your lifebelts on.

1385
01:54:17,012 --> 01:54:19,435
Let women and children through to the front.

1386
01:54:19,680 --> 01:54:21,024
What are we doing?

1387
01:54:21,266 --> 01:54:24,361
Waiting. Once first-class
people are in the boats...

1388
01:54:24,603 --> 01:54:27,948
they'll start with us and we want to be ready.

1389
01:54:29,107 --> 01:54:31,360
Pushing won't get you out any faster.

1390
01:54:31,693 --> 01:54:33,036
Go get help.

1391
01:54:33,360 --> 01:54:37,366
Lower it away, left and right together! Steady.

1392
01:54:38,033 --> 01:54:41,037
Both sides together! Steady!

1393
01:54:41,369 --> 01:54:42,541
Steady!

1394
01:54:42,870 --> 01:54:44,214
Steady!

1395
01:54:45,707 --> 01:54:47,709
Stop, stop. stop!

1396
01:54:48,543 --> 01:54:49,715
Hold the left!

1397
01:54:50,045 --> 01:54:52,548
Right side only! Right side only!

1398
01:54:52,880 --> 01:54:54,053
Right side!

1399
01:54:54,382 --> 01:54:58,228
Hold the left! Right side down!
Lower away together!

1400
01:55:00,388 --> 01:55:02,061
Steady, lads!

1401
01:55:49,437 --> 01:55:52,941
You know, I do believe this ship may sink.

1402
01:55:54,943 --> 01:55:59,619
I've been asked to give you
this small token of our appreciation.

1403
01:56:02,117 --> 01:56:04,791
Compliments of Mr. Caledon Hockley.

1404
01:56:11,543 --> 01:56:14,217
Come on, sister, you heard the man. Into the boat.

1405
01:56:14,546 --> 01:56:16,674
Any room for a gentleman, gentlemen?

1406
01:56:16,880 --> 01:56:18,224
Only women at this time, sir.

1407
01:56:21,553 --> 01:56:23,931
Will the lifeboats be
seated according to class?

1408
01:56:25,849 --> 01:56:28,568
I hope they're not too crowded.

1409
01:56:29,352 --> 01:56:31,195
Oh, Mother, shut up!

1410
01:56:32,063 --> 01:56:33,235
Don't you understand?

1411
01:56:33,732 --> 01:56:35,450
The water is freezing and
there aren't enough boats

1412
01:56:35,734 --> 01:56:37,361
Not enough by half.

1413
01:56:38,236 --> 01:56:40,739
Half the people on this ship are going to die.

1414
01:56:41,072 --> 01:56:42,699
Not the better half.

1415
01:56:44,576 --> 01:56:45,623
Come on, Ruth, gel in the boat.

1416
01:56:46,202 --> 01:56:48,079
First class seats are right up here.

1417
01:56:49,247 --> 01:56:51,120
You know, it's a pity I didn't keep that drawing.

1418
01:56:51,220 --> 01:56:52,800
It'll be worth a lot more by morning.

1419
01:56:56,755 --> 01:56:59,429
You unimaginable bastard.

1420
01:57:00,216 --> 01:57:02,218
Come on, Rose darling.
There's plenty of room for you.

1421
01:57:04,095 --> 01:57:05,142
Come on, Rose.

1422
01:57:05,639 --> 01:57:07,266
You're next, darling.

1423
01:57:07,599 --> 01:57:08,771
Come into the boat, Rose.

1424
01:57:11,227 --> 01:57:12,228
Come.

1425
01:57:12,562 --> 01:57:13,609
Rose.

1426
01:57:14,439 --> 01:57:15,736
Get into the boat!

1427
01:57:17,233 --> 01:57:18,234
Rose.

1428
01:57:19,402 --> 01:57:20,574
Good-bye, Mother.

1429
01:57:24,740 --> 01:57:26,243
Where are you going?

1430
01:57:26,950 --> 01:57:27,952
To him?!

1431
01:57:28,912 --> 01:57:30,414
To be a whore to a gutter rat?

1432
01:57:31,623 --> 01:57:33,967
I'd rather be his whore than your wife.

1433
01:57:36,336 --> 01:57:38,464
No!

1434
01:57:39,172 --> 01:57:41,174
I said, no!

1435
01:57:42,467 --> 01:57:44,811
Rose! Please, stop!

1436
01:57:46,096 --> 01:57:47,439
And, lower away!

1437
01:57:48,765 --> 01:57:49,820
No, Wait!

1438
01:57:49,920 --> 01:57:50,920
Lower away!

1439
01:57:51,020 --> 01:57:52,811
- Rose!
- Lower together!

1440
01:57:53,478 --> 01:57:54,855
Hold the left side!

1441
01:57:58,775 --> 01:57:59,776
Help!

1442
01:58:00,652 --> 01:58:02,780
Can anybody hear me?!

1443
01:58:04,155 --> 01:58:05,828
Hello! Help me!

1444
01:58:06,658 --> 01:58:07,659
Help me!

1445
01:58:08,493 --> 01:58:10,495
Can you hear me?!

1446
01:58:10,829 --> 01:58:14,834
Can anybody hear me?! Somebody help me!

1447
01:58:16,000 --> 01:58:17,502
Mr. Andrews?!

1448
01:58:21,172 --> 01:58:23,345
Steward, check the starboard corridor.

1449
01:58:23,633 --> 01:58:26,136
Madame, please put on a lifebelt.
Get to the boat deck immediately.

1450
01:58:26,678 --> 01:58:29,320
Lucy, for God's sake put on your
lifebelt and set a good example.

1451
01:58:29,420 --> 01:58:30,390
Yes sir.

1452
01:58:31,015 --> 01:58:32,358
- Anyone in here?
- Mr. Andrews!

1453
01:58:32,684 --> 01:58:34,527
Mr. Andrews! Thank God!

1454
01:58:34,810 --> 01:58:37,155
Where would the Master at Arms
take someone under arrest?

1455
01:58:37,730 --> 01:58:39,120
What? You have to get to a boat right away.

1456
01:58:39,220 --> 01:58:40,120
No!

1457
01:58:40,220 --> 01:58:42,489
I'm doing this with or without your help, sir.

1458
01:58:43,027 --> 01:58:44,028
But without will take longer.

1459
01:58:46,990 --> 01:58:49,320
Take the elevator to the
very bottom. Go to the left...

1460
01:58:49,420 --> 01:58:50,520
down the crewmen's passage.

1461
01:58:50,620 --> 01:58:53,320
Then go right and left again at the stairs.

1462
01:58:53,420 --> 01:58:54,665
You'll come to a long corridor.

1463
01:58:59,544 --> 01:59:01,217
This could be bad.

1464
01:59:05,049 --> 01:59:07,723
Oh, shit! Oh, shit!

1465
01:59:13,057 --> 01:59:15,059
Excuse me. Thank you.

1466
01:59:18,563 --> 01:59:21,567
I'm sorry, miss, but the lifts are closed.

1467
01:59:22,400 --> 01:59:25,320
I'm through being polite, goddamnit!

1468
01:59:25,420 --> 01:59:26,453
Now take me down!

1469
01:59:27,739 --> 01:59:29,082
E deck.

1470
01:59:32,410 --> 01:59:33,753
Come on.

1471
01:59:34,204 --> 01:59:35,547
Come on, come on.

1472
01:59:53,389 --> 01:59:54,720
I'm going back up.

1473
01:59:54,820 --> 01:59:56,939
No! No! No!

1474
02:00:01,105 --> 02:00:02,948
Come back! I'm going back up!

1475
02:00:03,274 --> 02:00:04,275
I'm going back up!

1476
02:00:13,284 --> 02:00:14,285
Crew passage.

1477
02:00:37,642 --> 02:00:38,643
Jack!

1478
02:00:51,447 --> 02:00:52,448
Rose!

1479
02:00:54,868 --> 02:00:56,290
Rose, I'm in here!

1480
02:00:56,870 --> 02:00:58,213
I'm in here!

1481
02:00:58,746 --> 02:00:59,838
I'm in here!

1482
02:01:02,040 --> 02:01:04,043
Jack! I'm sorry.

1483
02:01:04,377 --> 02:01:06,721
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

1484
02:01:07,714 --> 02:01:09,120
That guy Lovejoy put it in my pocket.

1485
02:01:09,220 --> 02:01:11,120
I know, I know, I know.

1486
02:01:11,220 --> 02:01:12,220
Listen Rose...

1487
02:01:12,320 --> 02:01:14,720
you're gonna have to find
the spare key, all right?

1488
02:01:14,820 --> 02:01:16,147
Look in that cabinet right there.

1489
02:01:17,682 --> 02:01:19,605
It's a little silver one, Rose.

1490
02:01:22,186 --> 02:01:23,688
These are all brass ones!

1491
02:01:24,564 --> 02:01:26,066
Check right here, Rose.

1492
02:01:30,653 --> 02:01:31,654
Rose.

1493
02:01:32,989 --> 02:01:34,582
How did you find out I didn't do it?

1494
02:01:35,033 --> 02:01:36,120
I didn't.

1495
02:01:36,220 --> 02:01:38,161
I just realized I already knew.

1496
02:01:40,747 --> 02:01:41,748
Keep looking.

1497
02:01:51,090 --> 02:01:52,137
No key.

1498
02:01:52,675 --> 02:01:53,720
There's no key!

1499
02:01:53,820 --> 02:01:54,761
All right, Rose, listen.

1500
02:01:55,094 --> 02:01:56,471
You're gonna have to go find some help.

1501
02:01:57,347 --> 02:01:58,348
It'll be all right.

1502
02:02:03,770 --> 02:02:05,192
I'll be right back.

1503
02:02:12,779 --> 02:02:14,622
I'll just wait here!

1504
02:02:27,919 --> 02:02:29,136
Hello? Is there anyone here?

1505
02:02:30,338 --> 02:02:31,339
Hello?

1506
02:02:31,965 --> 02:02:33,592
Is there anybody down here?

1507
02:02:34,800 --> 02:02:36,599
We need help! Hello?

1508
02:02:38,304 --> 02:02:39,305
Damnit!

1509
02:02:45,812 --> 02:02:49,658
Can anybody hear me, please?! Hello?! Hello?!

1510
02:02:51,650 --> 02:02:52,994
Oh, thank God.

1511
02:02:53,319 --> 02:02:54,445
Wait, please, I need your help.

1512
02:02:54,737 --> 02:02:55,738
There's a man back here and he's--

1513
02:02:56,614 --> 02:02:57,615
Wait!

1514
02:03:01,828 --> 02:03:03,171
Hello?!

1515
02:03:28,938 --> 02:03:29,985
Hello?

1516
02:03:31,440 --> 02:03:32,943
Miss, you shouldn't be here now.

1517
02:03:33,234 --> 02:03:34,451
I need your help.

1518
02:03:34,819 --> 02:03:36,571
There is a man down here and he is trapped.

1519
02:03:36,779 --> 02:03:37,780
- This way, yes. All right.
- Please!

1520
02:03:38,114 --> 02:03:39,957
- There's no need to panic.
- No, I'm not panicking!

1521
02:03:40,199 --> 02:03:42,042
You're going the wrong way!

1522
02:03:42,368 --> 02:03:44,120
Let go of me! Listen!

1523
02:03:49,792 --> 02:03:50,793
To hell with you.

1524
02:04:28,748 --> 02:04:30,250
Oh, my God.

1525
02:05:22,300 --> 02:05:23,894
Will this work?

1526
02:05:24,804 --> 02:05:25,896
I guess we'll find out.

1527
02:05:26,556 --> 02:05:27,557
Come on.

1528
02:05:30,643 --> 02:05:31,644
Wait, wait, wail.

1529
02:05:32,310 --> 02:05:33,813
Try a couple practice swings over there.

1530
02:05:40,027 --> 02:05:41,028
Good.

1531
02:05:41,320 --> 02:05:43,118
Now try and hit the same mark
again, Rose. You can do it.

1532
02:05:49,829 --> 02:05:52,420
Okay, that's enough practice. Come on, Rose.

1533
02:05:52,520 --> 02:05:54,049
You can do it.

1534
02:05:54,333 --> 02:05:58,008
Listen, just hit it really hard and really fast.

1535
02:05:59,380 --> 02:06:00,720
Come on, wait.

1536
02:06:00,820 --> 02:06:03,009
Open your hands up a little more.

1537
02:06:03,342 --> 02:06:04,685
- Like that?
- Right.

1538
02:06:05,678 --> 02:06:07,726
Listen, Rose, I trust you.

1539
02:06:12,685 --> 02:06:13,686
Go.

1540
02:06:20,026 --> 02:06:21,073
You did it!

1541
02:06:21,694 --> 02:06:23,037
Come on. Let's go.

1542
02:06:23,696 --> 02:06:25,698
Oh shit, this is cold! Oh, shit!

1543
02:06:26,032 --> 02:06:27,625
Shit! Shit!

1544
02:06:33,206 --> 02:06:34,298
This is the way out.

1545
02:06:35,374 --> 02:06:37,877
We have to find another way. Come on.

1546
02:06:40,922 --> 02:06:41,923
Pull.

1547
02:06:42,965 --> 02:06:43,966
Put your backs into it.

1548
02:06:49,930 --> 02:06:50,932
Pull!

1549
02:06:51,890 --> 02:06:54,735
Now, there's something you don't see every day.

1550
02:07:16,582 --> 02:07:19,520
What's this luggage doing here?
Get rid of it. Get rid of it.

1551
02:07:19,620 --> 02:07:20,635
We need the room. Get rid of that. Out.

1552
02:07:22,505 --> 02:07:25,509
This way. Let go, sir. Gel back.

1553
02:07:25,758 --> 02:07:27,101
Keep calm!

1554
02:07:34,433 --> 02:07:35,434
Lovejoy!

1555
02:07:35,810 --> 02:07:37,812
She's not on the starboard side either.

1556
02:07:38,104 --> 02:07:42,109
We're running out of time. This strutting
martinet isn't letting any men on at all.

1557
02:07:42,775 --> 02:07:44,777
There's one on the other side letting men on.

1558
02:07:45,444 --> 02:07:46,820
Well then, that's our play.

1559
02:07:46,920 --> 02:07:49,578
We'll need some insurance first. Come on.

1560
02:07:50,449 --> 02:07:52,543
This way, please. All the way down here.

1561
02:07:55,620 --> 02:07:56,622
Here!

1562
02:07:57,832 --> 02:07:59,129
What do you think you're doing?

1563
02:07:59,625 --> 02:08:01,627
You'll have to pay for that, you know.

1564
02:08:01,877 --> 02:08:03,629
That's White Star Line property.

1565
02:08:03,963 --> 02:08:05,465
Shut up!

1566
02:08:06,299 --> 02:08:09,473
Will you hold the boat a moment?
I just have to run back to my room--

1567
02:08:10,303 --> 02:08:11,350
Sit down!

1568
02:08:11,970 --> 02:08:13,120
She's the last.

1569
02:08:13,220 --> 02:08:15,020
- Prepare to lower.
- Mr. Lightoller.

1570
02:08:15,120 --> 02:08:17,022
Why are the boats being launched half full?

1571
02:08:17,310 --> 02:08:18,311
Not now, Mr. Andrews.

1572
02:08:18,560 --> 02:08:21,735
There, look. Twenty or so
in a boat built for sixty-five?

1573
02:08:21,980 --> 02:08:23,983
And I saw one boat with only twelve. Twelve!

1574
02:08:24,317 --> 02:08:27,366
Well, we weren't sure of the weight, Mr. Andrews.

1575
02:08:27,570 --> 02:08:28,696
These boats may buckle.

1576
02:08:28,904 --> 02:08:29,905
Rubbish!

1577
02:08:30,156 --> 02:08:32,830
They were tested in Belfast
with the weight of seventy men.

1578
02:08:33,242 --> 02:08:35,711
Now, fill these boats,
Mr. Lightoller. For God's sake man!

1579
02:08:43,002 --> 02:08:45,846
Please, I need more women and children, please!

1580
02:08:51,177 --> 02:08:52,349
Get back in there!

1581
02:08:52,678 --> 02:08:55,181
This is not an exit. This is not an exit.

1582
02:08:57,767 --> 02:09:00,441
You can't keep us locked in here.
Like animals. The ship's bloody sinking.

1583
02:09:01,687 --> 02:09:03,689
Bring forward the women!

1584
02:09:04,023 --> 02:09:05,525
Unlock the gates.

1585
02:09:06,359 --> 02:09:08,361
Women only!

1586
02:09:09,028 --> 02:09:10,701
No men!

1587
02:09:11,030 --> 02:09:12,532
No men!

1588
02:09:17,036 --> 02:09:18,913
Get back!

1589
02:09:20,206 --> 02:09:21,320
Get back!

1590
02:09:21,420 --> 02:09:22,751
Lock the gates!

1591
02:09:23,542 --> 02:09:24,919
Get them back from those gates!

1592
02:09:26,295 --> 02:09:27,592
Don't touch the gates!

1593
02:09:31,217 --> 02:09:32,620
For God's sake, man...

1594
02:09:32,720 --> 02:09:34,265
there are women and children down here!

1595
02:09:34,553 --> 02:09:36,897
Let us up so we can have a chance!

1596
02:09:37,932 --> 02:09:38,933
Get back!

1597
02:09:42,686 --> 02:09:43,820
Tommy!

1598
02:09:43,920 --> 02:09:45,398
- Can we get out?
- It's hopeless that way.

1599
02:09:45,730 --> 02:09:47,153
Whatever we do, we've got to do it fast.

1600
02:09:50,903 --> 02:09:52,325
The boats are all going.

1601
02:09:52,655 --> 02:09:54,520
This whole place is flooding.
We've gotta get out of here.

1602
02:09:54,620 --> 02:09:55,620
There is niente this way.

1603
02:09:56,742 --> 02:09:57,994
Let's go this way, all right? Come on!

1604
02:10:04,083 --> 02:10:05,255
I make my own luck.

1605
02:10:05,584 --> 02:10:07,086
So do I.

1606
02:10:14,927 --> 02:10:16,270
Come on!

1607
02:10:16,762 --> 02:10:17,809
No, come on, let's go this way.

1608
02:10:27,356 --> 02:10:28,528
This way!

1609
02:10:29,400 --> 02:10:30,777
Just go back to the main stairwell.

1610
02:10:31,944 --> 02:10:33,241
And everything will be sorted out there.

1611
02:10:34,697 --> 02:10:36,540
It will all get sorted out back there.

1612
02:10:36,907 --> 02:10:38,120
Go back to the main stairwell.

1613
02:10:38,220 --> 02:10:40,127
- Open the gate!
- Go back down the main stairwell.

1614
02:10:40,369 --> 02:10:41,712
Open the gate right now!

1615
02:10:41,954 --> 02:10:44,048
Go back down the main stairwell, like I told you.

1616
02:10:46,292 --> 02:10:48,795
Goddamn it! Son of a bitch!

1617
02:10:49,128 --> 02:10:50,801
Stop that!

1618
02:10:54,717 --> 02:10:55,820
Fabri, Tommy, give me a hand here.

1619
02:10:55,920 --> 02:10:56,920
Move aside.

1620
02:10:57,020 --> 02:10:59,100
Come on, pull!

1621
02:10:59,972 --> 02:11:00,973
Pull!

1622
02:11:01,974 --> 02:11:03,320
Move aside. Quickly, move aside!

1623
02:11:03,420 --> 02:11:04,420
Put that down!

1624
02:11:04,520 --> 02:11:05,820
- Move aside!
- Put that down!

1625
02:11:05,920 --> 02:11:07,154
One! Two!

1626
02:11:08,063 --> 02:11:09,235
Three!

1627
02:11:11,484 --> 02:11:12,656
Again!

1628
02:11:14,653 --> 02:11:15,700
Now, let's go!

1629
02:11:18,032 --> 02:11:19,120
Let's go, Rose.

1630
02:11:19,220 --> 02:11:21,331
You can't go up there! You can't do this!

1631
02:11:27,666 --> 02:11:29,509
Keep order! Keep order here!

1632
02:11:29,835 --> 02:11:32,679
Back! Back! Back!

1633
02:11:37,259 --> 02:11:38,260
Hold on to her!

1634
02:11:39,845 --> 02:11:40,892
Pull her in!

1635
02:11:41,847 --> 02:11:44,350
Get back, I say, or I'll...

1636
02:11:44,683 --> 02:11:46,856
shoot you all like dogs!

1637
02:11:47,186 --> 02:11:48,688
Keep order here!

1638
02:11:49,688 --> 02:11:51,861
Keep order, I say.

1639
02:11:52,690 --> 02:11:54,864
Mr. Lowe, man this boat.

1640
02:11:59,365 --> 02:12:03,541
Right. Is everybody all right? Nobody panic.

1641
02:12:09,708 --> 02:12:11,381
Stay back.

1642
02:12:11,877 --> 02:12:13,049
We're too late.

1643
02:12:13,295 --> 02:12:16,390
There are more boats down the front.
Stay with this one. Murdoch...

1644
02:12:16,632 --> 02:12:18,179
he seems to be quite practical.

1645
02:12:22,888 --> 02:12:24,390
Don't lower it!

1646
02:12:24,890 --> 02:12:26,892
Cut the falls!

1647
02:12:32,398 --> 02:12:34,241
Sit down!

1648
02:12:35,568 --> 02:12:36,990
Stay back, you lot!

1649
02:12:37,236 --> 02:12:40,410
Just stay back, the lot of you! Stay back!

1650
02:12:43,075 --> 02:12:45,749
It's starting to fall apart.
We don't have much time.

1651
02:12:47,413 --> 02:12:48,756
Mr. Murdoch?

1652
02:12:49,080 --> 02:12:51,584
Mr. Hockley.

1653
02:12:51,834 --> 02:12:53,520
I'm a businessman, as you know...

1654
02:12:53,620 --> 02:12:55,179
and I have a business proposition for you.

1655
02:13:02,928 --> 02:13:04,100
Come on, Rose.

1656
02:13:07,600 --> 02:13:08,601
The boats are gone!

1657
02:13:14,273 --> 02:13:15,946
Colonel, are there any boats on that side?

1658
02:13:16,190 --> 02:13:18,720
No, miss, but there are a couple
of boats all the way forward.

1659
02:13:18,820 --> 02:13:20,329
This way, I'll lead you.

1660
02:13:26,535 --> 02:13:29,880
What's the use? Nobody's listening to us anyway.

1661
02:13:30,122 --> 02:13:31,720
Well, they don't listen to us at dinner, either.

1662
02:13:31,820 --> 02:13:32,920
Come on, let's play.

1663
02:13:33,020 --> 02:13:34,343
Keep us warm.

1664
02:13:35,127 --> 02:13:36,470
"Orpheus."

1665
02:13:41,300 --> 02:13:44,099
Music to drown by. Now I know I'm in first class.

1666
02:13:49,975 --> 02:13:53,320
- Where is everyone?
- They're all still aft, sir.

1667
02:13:55,314 --> 02:13:57,487
We have an understanding then, Mr. Murdoch.

1668
02:14:08,827 --> 02:14:12,832
Will the men please hold back! Hold back, I say!

1669
02:14:15,167 --> 02:14:18,120
Women and children only!

1670
02:14:18,220 --> 02:14:20,051
Get back!

1671
02:14:20,339 --> 02:14:23,013
Come through, madame. This way. Step back, sir!

1672
02:14:24,510 --> 02:14:27,354
You better check the other side. Go!

1673
02:14:34,687 --> 02:14:36,530
I found her, on the other side.

1674
02:14:37,189 --> 02:14:38,611
Waiting for a boat.

1675
02:14:39,108 --> 02:14:40,109
With him.

1676
02:14:41,777 --> 02:14:43,871
- Any more women and children?
- They're all aboard, Mr. Murdoch.

1677
02:14:44,196 --> 02:14:46,039
Anyone else then?

1678
02:14:47,616 --> 02:14:49,038
- Anyone else?
- Do hurry. Hurry along.

1679
02:14:55,207 --> 02:14:57,209
Goddamn it all to hell.

1680
02:14:59,878 --> 02:15:01,221
Shit.

1681
02:15:01,505 --> 02:15:02,506
Fire!

1682
02:15:03,924 --> 02:15:05,847
Sir, sir, you can't go through here.

1683
02:15:09,470 --> 02:15:11,815
That's it. Splendid. Right.

1684
02:15:15,728 --> 02:15:17,401
Prepare to lower.

1685
02:15:19,565 --> 02:15:21,408
Ready on the left.

1686
02:15:27,322 --> 02:15:28,995
Take them down.

1687
02:15:33,829 --> 02:15:35,172
Keep it steady.

1688
02:15:37,833 --> 02:15:41,758
Both sides together. Steady. Keep it steady.

1689
02:15:42,796 --> 02:15:44,139
- Give her to me.
- Daddy.

1690
02:15:44,965 --> 02:15:47,309
It'll be fine, darling. Don't you worry.

1691
02:15:47,634 --> 02:15:49,307
Daddy, get in the boat.

1692
02:15:49,636 --> 02:15:52,480
It's goodbye for a little while.
Only for a little while.

1693
02:15:52,723 --> 02:15:54,771
There'll be another boat for the daddies.

1694
02:15:55,350 --> 02:15:56,620
This boat is for the mummies and the children.

1695
02:15:56,720 --> 02:15:58,737
You hold Mummy's hand and be a good little girl.

1696
02:16:00,230 --> 02:16:01,573
I'm not going without you.

1697
02:16:01,815 --> 02:16:03,420
No, you have to go, now.

1698
02:16:03,520 --> 02:16:04,520
No, Jack.

1699
02:16:04,620 --> 02:16:05,920
Get in the boat, Rose.

1700
02:16:06,020 --> 02:16:07,220
No, Jack.

1701
02:16:07,320 --> 02:16:08,320
Yes.

1702
02:16:08,420 --> 02:16:09,320
Get on the boat!

1703
02:16:09,420 --> 02:16:11,750
Yes, get on the boat, Rose.

1704
02:16:14,578 --> 02:16:15,750
Oh my God, look at you.

1705
02:16:15,996 --> 02:16:17,820
You look a fright.

1706
02:16:17,920 --> 02:16:18,916
Here.

1707
02:16:20,667 --> 02:16:22,840
Put this on. Come.

1708
02:16:27,840 --> 02:16:29,684
Go on. I'll get the next one.

1709
02:16:29,927 --> 02:16:31,770
No, not without you.

1710
02:16:32,012 --> 02:16:33,855
I'll be all right. Listen, I'll be fine.

1711
02:16:34,180 --> 02:16:36,024
I'm a survivor, all right? Don't worry about me.

1712
02:16:36,350 --> 02:16:37,647
Now, go on. Get on.

1713
02:16:38,185 --> 02:16:39,812
I have an arrangement with an
officer on the other side of the ship.

1714
02:16:40,270 --> 02:16:41,817
Jack and I can get off safely.

1715
02:16:42,356 --> 02:16:43,357
Both of us.

1716
02:16:44,525 --> 02:16:45,620
See?

1717
02:16:45,720 --> 02:16:46,739
I got my own boat to catch.

1718
02:16:47,528 --> 02:16:48,520
Go on, hurry.

1719
02:16:48,620 --> 02:16:50,034
They're almost full.

1720
02:16:51,532 --> 02:16:52,658
- Step aboard, miss
- Go! Go!

1721
02:16:54,535 --> 02:16:55,707
Step aboard, please.

1722
02:16:55,994 --> 02:16:57,420
You're daddy's good girl, all right?

1723
02:16:57,520 --> 02:16:58,622
You're my little sailor.

1724
02:17:02,876 --> 02:17:03,877
Clear the rail, please

1725
02:17:05,546 --> 02:17:06,798
And, lower away!

1726
02:17:20,644 --> 02:17:21,987
You're a good liar.

1727
02:17:22,729 --> 02:17:24,572
Almost as good as you.

1728
02:17:29,236 --> 02:17:32,911
There's no, uh...
there's no arrangement, is there?

1729
02:17:34,240 --> 02:17:35,743
No, there is.

1730
02:17:36,076 --> 02:17:38,249
Not that you'll benefit much from it.

1731
02:17:40,163 --> 02:17:41,836
I always win, Jack.

1732
02:17:42,916 --> 02:17:44,589
One way or another.

1733
02:18:42,726 --> 02:18:43,773
Rose!

1734
02:18:46,146 --> 02:18:47,147
Stop her!

1735
02:18:47,898 --> 02:18:48,899
Rose, what are you doing?!

1736
02:18:50,984 --> 02:18:51,985
No!

1737
02:19:15,008 --> 02:19:17,682
Rose! You're so stupid!
Why did you do that, huh?

1738
02:19:18,010 --> 02:19:20,013
You're so stupid, Rose.

1739
02:19:21,348 --> 02:19:23,021
Why did you do that? Why?!

1740
02:19:24,350 --> 02:19:26,353
You jump, I jump, right?

1741
02:19:28,188 --> 02:19:29,235
Right.

1742
02:19:31,900 --> 02:19:33,493
Oh God. I couldn't go.

1743
02:19:34,444 --> 02:19:36,020
I couldn't go, Jack.

1744
02:19:36,120 --> 02:19:37,702
It's all right. We'll think of something.

1745
02:19:39,366 --> 02:19:40,868
- At least I'm with you.
- We'll think of something.

1746
02:19:55,340 --> 02:19:56,387
Come on! Move!

1747
02:19:59,720 --> 02:20:00,721
Come on! Move.

1748
02:20:07,519 --> 02:20:08,520
Come on!

1749
02:20:16,653 --> 02:20:17,654
Move!

1750
02:20:23,910 --> 02:20:25,412
Come on! Come on Rose.

1751
02:20:27,998 --> 02:20:28,999
Rose, come on!

1752
02:20:32,002 --> 02:20:33,049
Move Rose!

1753
02:20:36,130 --> 02:20:37,132
Go!

1754
02:20:47,726 --> 02:20:50,445
I hope you enjoy your time together!

1755
02:21:04,450 --> 02:21:06,795
What could possibly be funny?

1756
02:21:08,205 --> 02:21:09,957
I put the diamond in the coat.

1757
02:21:12,709 --> 02:21:14,632
And I put the coat on her!

1758
02:21:16,379 --> 02:21:17,471
Come on!

1759
02:21:37,734 --> 02:21:39,156
Dada!

1760
02:21:41,488 --> 02:21:42,614
We can't leave him.

1761
02:21:47,160 --> 02:21:48,503
All right, come on!

1762
02:21:50,163 --> 02:21:52,336
Dada!

1763
02:22:05,428 --> 02:22:06,771
Go back!

1764
02:22:17,482 --> 02:22:18,720
It's the wrong way! Come back!

1765
02:22:18,820 --> 02:22:21,327
No, not that way! Come back! Stop!

1766
02:22:26,366 --> 02:22:27,538
Go!

1767
02:22:29,870 --> 02:22:33,545
Go! Run!

1768
02:22:59,232 --> 02:23:00,233
This way!

1769
02:23:12,412 --> 02:23:13,584
Give me your hand!

1770
02:23:22,589 --> 02:23:23,932
Oh, God!

1771
02:23:28,260 --> 02:23:29,433
Help!

1772
02:23:35,268 --> 02:23:36,611
Help!

1773
02:23:38,063 --> 02:23:39,220
Wait, sir!

1774
02:23:39,320 --> 02:23:40,778
Sir, open the gate, please!

1775
02:23:41,024 --> 02:23:42,196
Help us, please!

1776
02:23:42,442 --> 02:23:43,720
Help us!

1777
02:23:43,820 --> 02:23:44,949
- Please!
- Please!

1778
02:23:46,613 --> 02:23:47,956
Bloody hell!

1779
02:23:53,620 --> 02:23:55,622
- Come on, come on!
- Come on!

1780
02:23:55,956 --> 02:23:57,299
Go, go!

1781
02:23:57,540 --> 02:23:58,541
Jesus.

1782
02:23:59,626 --> 02:24:00,627
- Please!
- Come on!

1783
02:24:00,877 --> 02:24:02,129
Hurry!

1784
02:24:03,004 --> 02:24:04,051
Come on!

1785
02:24:08,635 --> 02:24:10,387
I'm sorry, I dropped the keys.

1786
02:24:11,638 --> 02:24:13,811
- Wait, please!
- Wait!

1787
02:24:14,140 --> 02:24:16,643
Don't leave! Please, send for help!

1788
02:24:35,328 --> 02:24:37,330
I got it! Which one is it, Rose?

1789
02:24:37,664 --> 02:24:39,666
The short one. Try the short one.

1790
02:24:40,667 --> 02:24:41,668
Hurry, Jack.

1791
02:24:45,338 --> 02:24:47,011
Oh no! It won't go in

1792
02:24:47,924 --> 02:24:48,925
Hurry, Jack.

1793
02:24:51,510 --> 02:24:53,434
It's stuck! It's stuck!

1794
02:24:54,680 --> 02:24:56,354
- Come on!
- Hurry, Jack!

1795
02:24:58,018 --> 02:24:59,691
- Hurry, Jack!
- Come on!

1796
02:25:02,355 --> 02:25:04,357
I got it! I got it! Go! Go, Rose!

1797
02:25:05,358 --> 02:25:06,701
Go! Go!

1798
02:25:19,039 --> 02:25:21,383
Jack! Come on!

1799
02:25:23,376 --> 02:25:24,878
Move, move.

1800
02:25:34,720 --> 02:25:36,564
- Get those oars in place.
- Get an oar under it.

1801
02:25:41,728 --> 02:25:43,401
Hold it! Hold it!

1802
02:25:43,730 --> 02:25:45,073
Hold it!

1803
02:25:54,990 --> 02:25:59,246
Get these davits cranked in!
Let's get the falls hooked up!

1804
02:26:11,424 --> 02:26:13,267
Mommy!

1805
02:26:19,933 --> 02:26:21,025
Keep going up!

1806
02:26:24,270 --> 02:26:25,772
Stop pushing!

1807
02:26:27,940 --> 02:26:29,284
Stay back!

1808
02:26:29,526 --> 02:26:32,029
Will you give us a chance
to live, you limey bastard!

1809
02:26:32,278 --> 02:26:34,920
I'll shoot any man who tries
to get past me! Get back!

1810
02:26:35,020 --> 02:26:36,040
Bastard!

1811
02:26:36,282 --> 02:26:37,920
Get back!

1812
02:26:38,020 --> 02:26:39,043
We had a deal, damn you!

1813
02:26:42,455 --> 02:26:45,520
Your money can't save you
any more than it could save me.

1814
02:26:45,620 --> 02:26:46,584
Get back!

1815
02:26:47,794 --> 02:26:49,717
Women and children only!

1816
02:26:58,638 --> 02:26:59,981
No, Tommy!

1817
02:27:18,700 --> 02:27:19,701
No, Will!

1818
02:27:26,583 --> 02:27:28,085
Now stand back, damn you!

1819
02:27:31,420 --> 02:27:34,925
Gently, gently. Hold it. Hold it.

1820
02:27:44,600 --> 02:27:46,274
I have a child!

1821
02:27:46,603 --> 02:27:48,731
- I have a child!
- Clear a path here!

1822
02:27:49,105 --> 02:27:51,107
Please, I have a child!

1823
02:27:51,940 --> 02:27:54,615
Please. I'm all she has in the world.

1824
02:27:55,570 --> 02:27:56,617
Go on.

1825
02:27:56,946 --> 02:27:57,947
Step back!

1826
02:27:58,448 --> 02:27:59,791
- Please?
- Here, give her to me!

1827
02:28:00,492 --> 02:28:01,914
You're all right, dearie.

1828
02:28:04,996 --> 02:28:06,088
Give her here.

1829
02:28:07,999 --> 02:28:09,000
There, there.

1830
02:28:13,296 --> 02:28:16,140
Wait, wait, wait! Mr. Andrews!

1831
02:28:18,635 --> 02:28:19,636
Oh, Rose.

1832
02:28:22,639 --> 02:28:23,982
Won't you even make a try for it?

1833
02:28:25,975 --> 02:28:30,481
I'm sorry that I didn't build you
a stronger ship, young Rose.

1834
02:28:32,315 --> 02:28:34,659
It's going fast. We have to move.

1835
02:28:34,943 --> 02:28:35,944
Wail.

1836
02:28:38,988 --> 02:28:40,456
Good luck to you, Rose.

1837
02:28:42,492 --> 02:28:43,493
And to you.

1838
02:28:56,464 --> 02:28:57,511
Mr. Guggenheim?

1839
02:28:57,966 --> 02:28:59,138
These are for you, Mr. Guggenheim.

1840
02:28:59,342 --> 02:29:00,420
No, thank you.

1841
02:29:00,520 --> 02:29:04,390
We are dressed in our best and are
prepared to go down as gentlemen.

1842
02:29:05,180 --> 02:29:07,149
But we would like a brandy.

1843
02:29:07,850 --> 02:29:10,353
Get the falls over here now!

1844
02:29:11,020 --> 02:29:13,489
Let them drop. Then we'll right it.

1845
02:29:18,736 --> 02:29:19,862
Capitén?

1846
02:29:20,363 --> 02:29:22,707
Capitén, where should I go? Please.

1847
02:29:30,039 --> 02:29:32,041
Captain. Captain. Sir.

1848
02:30:02,530 --> 02:30:04,749
Right. That's it, then.

1849
02:30:05,575 --> 02:30:07,202
Good-bye, Wally. Good luck.

1850
02:30:08,244 --> 02:30:09,416
- Good-bye, Wallace.
- So long, old chap.

1851
02:31:24,654 --> 02:31:29,160
And so they lived happily
together for three hundred years...

1852
02:31:29,492 --> 02:31:31,665
in the land of Tir na nog...

1853
02:31:32,662 --> 02:31:35,336
Land of eternal youth and beauty.

1854
02:32:10,700 --> 02:32:12,120
There's no time!

1855
02:32:12,220 --> 02:32:13,578
Cut those falls!

1856
02:32:13,828 --> 02:32:16,001
Out them! Cut them if you have to!

1857
02:32:16,706 --> 02:32:19,380
I need a knife!

1858
02:32:21,043 --> 02:32:22,716
Cut the falls now!

1859
02:32:23,337 --> 02:32:24,714
Cut them loose!

1860
02:32:35,224 --> 02:32:37,067
Cut those bloody falls!

1861
02:33:24,732 --> 02:33:26,075
Gentlemen...

1862
02:33:26,567 --> 02:33:29,241
it has been a privilege playing with you tonight.

1863
02:34:30,047 --> 02:34:32,020
We have to stay on the ship as long as possible.

1864
02:34:32,120 --> 02:34:33,092
Come on!

1865
02:34:45,146 --> 02:34:46,819
This way. Through the rail.

1866
02:34:49,066 --> 02:34:50,409
Come on, Rose.

1867
02:34:50,735 --> 02:34:51,736
Jump.

1868
02:34:54,070 --> 02:34:55,163
Come on.

1869
02:35:28,439 --> 02:35:30,032
I got you! Jump!

1870
02:35:32,693 --> 02:35:34,536
I've got you, miss.

1871
02:35:38,366 --> 02:35:39,538
Back!

1872
02:36:09,730 --> 02:36:11,403
No! You'll swamp us!

1873
02:36:24,160 --> 02:36:27,256
Yea, though I walk through the
valley of the shadow of death--

1874
02:36:27,580 --> 02:36:30,334
You wanna walk a little faster
through that valley there?

1875
02:37:20,634 --> 02:37:22,220
Holy Mary, mother of God...

1876
02:37:22,320 --> 02:37:25,273
pray for us sinners now and
at the hour of our death. Amen.

1877
02:37:25,973 --> 02:37:27,120
Hail Mary, full of grace...

1878
02:37:27,220 --> 02:37:28,233
This way.

1879
02:37:38,569 --> 02:37:40,663
Come on!

1880
02:37:50,330 --> 02:37:52,754
And I saw a new Heaven and a new Earth...

1881
02:37:53,000 --> 02:37:56,504
for the first Heaven and
the first Earth had passed away...

1882
02:37:57,588 --> 02:37:59,181
and there was no more sea.

1883
02:38:05,679 --> 02:38:08,774
It'll be over soon. It'll all be over soon.

1884
02:38:14,355 --> 02:38:16,020
And He shall dwell with them.

1885
02:38:16,120 --> 02:38:20,449
And they shall be His people
and God Himself shall be with them...

1886
02:38:20,778 --> 02:38:22,200
and be their God.

1887
02:38:22,947 --> 02:38:24,039
Jack...

1888
02:38:25,032 --> 02:38:27,034
this is where we first met.

1889
02:38:34,083 --> 02:38:37,303
And God shall wipe away
all the tears from their eyes...

1890
02:38:37,628 --> 02:38:39,722
and there shall be no more death.

1891
02:38:40,214 --> 02:38:42,717
Neither shall there be sorrow or crying.

1892
02:38:43,217 --> 02:38:45,720
Neither shall there be any more pain...

1893
02:38:46,554 --> 02:38:49,307
for the former world has passed away.

1894
02:39:03,737 --> 02:39:06,081
Bloody pull faster! And pull!

1895
02:39:29,346 --> 02:39:30,689
Hang on, miss Trudy!

1896
02:40:06,634 --> 02:40:08,136
Hold on real tight.

1897
02:40:25,653 --> 02:40:27,496
God Almighty.

1898
02:40:34,954 --> 02:40:37,503
Keep those breakers in! Keep them in!

1899
02:41:56,493 --> 02:41:57,915
We have to move!

1900
02:42:03,834 --> 02:42:05,220
Give me your hand. I'll pull you over.

1901
02:42:05,320 --> 02:42:06,320
I can't.

1902
02:42:06,420 --> 02:42:07,420
Come on!

1903
02:42:07,520 --> 02:42:08,510
Give me your hand.

1904
02:42:10,257 --> 02:42:12,259
I've got you. I won't let go.

1905
02:42:12,843 --> 02:42:13,890
Come on, I've got you.

1906
02:42:25,105 --> 02:42:28,279
- What's happening, Jack?
- I don't know. I don't know.

1907
02:42:37,450 --> 02:42:38,452
Hold on.

1908
02:43:20,828 --> 02:43:22,000
This is it!

1909
02:43:34,007 --> 02:43:37,682
Oh, my God, Jack! Oh, God. Oh, God.

1910
02:43:38,345 --> 02:43:39,688
Hold on!

1911
02:43:54,695 --> 02:43:56,620
The ship is gonna suck us down.

1912
02:43:56,720 --> 02:43:58,916
Take a deep breath when I say.

1913
02:44:04,538 --> 02:44:06,720
Kick for the surface and keep kicking.

1914
02:44:06,820 --> 02:44:08,091
Do not let go of my hand.

1915
02:44:15,799 --> 02:44:17,020
We're going to make it, Rose.

1916
02:44:17,120 --> 02:44:18,120
Trust me.

1917
02:44:18,220 --> 02:44:19,470
I trust you.

1918
02:44:24,558 --> 02:44:26,560
Ready! Ready!

1919
02:44:27,060 --> 02:44:28,061
Now!

1920
02:45:04,430 --> 02:45:06,274
Jack! Jack!

1921
02:45:49,309 --> 02:45:50,310
Rose!

1922
02:45:50,810 --> 02:45:53,155
Get off her! Get off her!

1923
02:45:57,359 --> 02:45:59,032
Swim, Rose! I need you to swim!

1924
02:46:03,824 --> 02:46:05,497
Keep swimming.

1925
02:46:09,162 --> 02:46:10,505
It's so cold.

1926
02:46:10,747 --> 02:46:12,090
Swim, Rose!

1927
02:46:16,670 --> 02:46:18,013
Come on.

1928
02:46:20,007 --> 02:46:21,099
Keep swimming.

1929
02:46:21,340 --> 02:46:22,684
Come on.

1930
02:46:24,636 --> 02:46:25,720
Here...

1931
02:46:25,820 --> 02:46:26,976
get on it.

1932
02:46:27,680 --> 02:46:29,183
Get on top.

1933
02:46:36,565 --> 02:46:38,033
Come on, Rose.

1934
02:46:47,576 --> 02:46:49,249
Stay on it. Stay on, Rose.

1935
02:47:11,099 --> 02:47:12,601
It'll be all right now.

1936
02:47:15,103 --> 02:47:16,605
It'll be all right now.

1937
02:47:23,945 --> 02:47:25,117
Return...

1938
02:47:25,322 --> 02:47:26,995
the boats!

1939
02:47:31,119 --> 02:47:33,247
The boats are coming back for us Rose.

1940
02:47:33,789 --> 02:47:35,257
Hold on just a little bit longer.

1941
02:47:36,124 --> 02:47:38,798
They had to row away from the suction...

1942
02:47:39,002 --> 02:47:41,096
but now they'll be coming back.

1943
02:47:44,132 --> 02:47:45,475
For God's sake!

1944
02:47:45,759 --> 02:47:46,976
Please...

1945
02:47:47,302 --> 02:47:48,599
help us!

1946
02:47:53,975 --> 02:47:55,693
You don't understand.

1947
02:47:56,520 --> 02:47:58,693
If we go back, they'll swamp the boat.

1948
02:47:58,939 --> 02:48:00,282
They'll pull us right down, I'm telling you.

1949
02:48:00,816 --> 02:48:03,319
Oh, knock it off. You're scaring me.

1950
02:48:03,652 --> 02:48:06,155
Come on, girls, grab an oar. Let's go.

1951
02:48:06,446 --> 02:48:09,620
Are you out of your mind?
We're in the middle of the North Atlantic.

1952
02:48:09,825 --> 02:48:13,170
Now, do you people want to live
or do you want to die?!

1953
02:48:20,127 --> 02:48:22,346
I don't understand a one of you.

1954
02:48:24,172 --> 02:48:25,298
What's the matter with you?

1955
02:48:26,299 --> 02:48:27,721
It's your men out there!

1956
02:48:30,178 --> 02:48:31,851
There's plenty of room for more.

1957
02:48:32,139 --> 02:48:33,812
And there'll be one less on this boat...

1958
02:48:34,140 --> 02:48:37,520
if you don't shut that hole in your face!

1959
02:48:53,368 --> 02:48:57,498
Now, bring in your oars over there-
And tie these boats together as well

1960
02:49:01,877 --> 02:49:04,221
Now, make sure that's tied up nice and tight.

1961
02:49:07,716 --> 02:49:10,390
Right, listen to me, men. We have to go back.

1962
02:49:10,719 --> 02:49:14,320
I want to transfer all the women
from this boat into that boat right now...

1963
02:49:14,420 --> 02:49:15,520
was quick as you can, please.

1964
02:49:15,620 --> 02:49:18,060
Let's create some space over there.
Move forward and aft.

1965
02:49:28,069 --> 02:49:29,912
It's getting quiet.

1966
02:49:32,073 --> 02:49:35,418
It's just going to take a couple of minutes...

1967
02:49:35,910 --> 02:49:37,913
to get the boats organized.

1968
02:49:40,749 --> 02:49:42,422
I don't know about you but...

1969
02:49:42,750 --> 02:49:46,255
I intend to write a strongly worded letter...

1970
02:49:46,588 --> 02:49:48,215
to the White Star Line about all this.

1971
02:49:56,598 --> 02:49:58,271
I love you, Jack.

1972
02:50:04,940 --> 02:50:06,442
Don't you do that.

1973
02:50:07,943 --> 02:50:11,117
Don't you say your good-byes. Not yet.

1974
02:50:11,446 --> 02:50:12,948
Do you understand me?

1975
02:50:13,280 --> 02:50:15,124
I'm so cold.

1976
02:50:15,617 --> 02:50:17,119
Listen, Rose...

1977
02:50:18,286 --> 02:50:19,959
you're gonna get out of here.

1978
02:50:21,122 --> 02:50:22,624
You're gonna go on...

1979
02:50:23,959 --> 02:50:25,757
and you're gonna make lots of babies.

1980
02:50:26,460 --> 02:50:28,463
And you're gonna watch them grow.

1981
02:50:30,130 --> 02:50:31,420
You're gonna die an old...

1982
02:50:31,520 --> 02:50:32,676
man old lady.

1983
02:50:32,968 --> 02:50:34,641
Warm in her bed.

1984
02:50:36,304 --> 02:50:37,430
Not here.

1985
02:50:38,306 --> 02:50:40,809
Not this night. Not like this.

1986
02:50:41,142 --> 02:50:42,815
Do you understand me?

1987
02:50:45,814 --> 02:50:47,987
I can't feel my body.

1988
02:50:49,650 --> 02:50:51,220
Winning that ticket, Rose...

1989
02:50:51,320 --> 02:50:53,872
was the best thing that ever happened to me.

1990
02:50:55,490 --> 02:50:57,333
It brought me to you.

1991
02:50:58,952 --> 02:51:01,421
And I'm thankful for that, Rose.

1992
02:51:01,955 --> 02:51:03,298
I'm thankful.

1993
02:51:06,750 --> 02:51:07,843
You must...

1994
02:51:08,962 --> 02:51:10,964
you must do me this honor.

1995
02:51:13,967 --> 02:51:17,471
You must promise me that you'll survive.

1996
02:51:19,472 --> 02:51:21,145
That you won't give up...

1997
02:51:22,309 --> 02:51:24,311
no matter what happens.

1998
02:51:26,980 --> 02:51:29,324
No matter how hopeless.

1999
02:51:32,485 --> 02:51:34,658
Promise me now, Rose.

2000
02:51:36,823 --> 02:51:39,167
And never let go of that promise.

2001
02:51:40,827 --> 02:51:42,170
I promise.

2002
02:51:44,289 --> 02:51:45,962
Never let go.

2003
02:51:48,835 --> 02:51:50,963
I'll never let go, Jack.

2004
02:51:53,673 --> 02:51:55,346
I'll never let go.

2005
02:52:19,449 --> 02:52:20,951
Right ahead, sir.

2006
02:52:24,120 --> 02:52:25,622
Oars!

2007
02:52:26,122 --> 02:52:27,795
Do you see any moving?

2008
02:52:28,792 --> 02:52:30,715
No, sir. None moving, sir.

2009
02:52:31,294 --> 02:52:32,637
Check them.

2010
02:52:32,963 --> 02:52:34,465
Bring that oar up here.

2011
02:52:41,137 --> 02:52:42,138
Check them. Make sure.

2012
02:52:43,556 --> 02:52:45,183
These are dead, sir.

2013
02:52:45,684 --> 02:52:46,856
Now, give way.

2014
02:52:47,310 --> 02:52:48,357
Ahead easy.

2015
02:52:55,150 --> 02:52:56,653
Careful with your oars.

2016
02:52:57,237 --> 02:52:58,284
Don't hit them.

2017
02:53:00,824 --> 02:53:03,168
Is there anyone alive out there?

2018
02:53:04,660 --> 02:53:06,504
Can anyone hear me?

2019
02:53:08,665 --> 02:53:11,009
Is there anyone alive out there?

2020
02:53:17,840 --> 02:53:19,058
We waited too long.

2021
02:53:22,970 --> 02:53:24,820
Well, keep checking them!

2022
02:53:24,920 --> 02:53:26,521
Keep looking!

2023
02:53:27,350 --> 02:53:29,853
Is there anyone alive out there?

2024
02:53:33,356 --> 02:53:35,358
Can anyone hear me?

2025
02:53:46,536 --> 02:53:49,380
Come, Josephine...

2026
02:53:49,873 --> 02:53:54,379
...in my flying machine.

2027
02:53:55,879 --> 02:53:59,099
And it's up she goes.

2028
02:54:01,050 --> 02:54:03,053
Up she goes.

2029
02:54:08,558 --> 02:54:10,731
Come, Josephine...

2030
02:54:13,063 --> 02:54:15,407
in my flying...

2031
02:54:39,255 --> 02:54:40,598
Jack.

2032
02:54:58,440 --> 02:54:59,784
Jack.

2033
02:55:00,276 --> 02:55:01,619
There's a boat.

2034
02:55:14,790 --> 02:55:16,134
Jack.

2035
02:55:28,638 --> 02:55:30,640
There's a boat, Jack.

2036
02:56:14,350 --> 02:56:15,693
Come back.

2037
02:56:16,853 --> 02:56:18,355
Come back.

2038
02:56:20,523 --> 02:56:21,866
Come back.

2039
02:56:23,026 --> 02:56:24,528
Come back.

2040
02:56:25,360 --> 02:56:26,863
Come back.

2041
02:56:27,697 --> 02:56:30,041
Come back. Come back!

2042
02:56:31,534 --> 02:56:33,036
Hello!

2043
02:56:35,163 --> 02:56:37,040
Can anyone hear me?

2044
02:56:37,540 --> 02:56:39,213
There's nothing here, sir.

2045
02:56:41,710 --> 02:56:43,054
Come back.

2046
02:56:44,547 --> 02:56:45,890
Come back.

2047
02:56:53,723 --> 02:56:55,225
I'll never let go.

2048
02:56:55,475 --> 02:56:56,818
I promise.

2049
02:57:39,894 --> 02:57:41,737
Come about!

2050
02:58:03,084 --> 02:58:06,930
Fifteen hundred people went into the sea...

2051
02:58:07,255 --> 02:58:10,259
when Titanic sank from under us.

2052
02:58:12,093 --> 02:58:15,267
There were twenty boats floating nearby...

2053
02:58:16,430 --> 02:58:18,775
and only one came back.

2054
02:58:20,600 --> 02:58:21,727
One.

2055
02:58:23,438 --> 02:58:26,112
Six were saved from the water...

2056
02:58:26,607 --> 02:58:28,280
myself included.

2057
02:58:29,444 --> 02:58:30,741
Six...

2058
02:58:31,946 --> 02:58:33,823
out of fifteen hundred.

2059
02:58:37,118 --> 02:58:38,461
Afterward...

2060
02:58:39,620 --> 02:58:41,622
the seven hundred people in the boats...

2061
02:58:42,415 --> 02:58:44,509
had nothing to do but wait.

2062
02:58:46,127 --> 02:58:47,800
Wait to die.

2063
02:58:48,296 --> 02:58:49,798
Wait to live.

2064
02:58:50,965 --> 02:58:53,138
Wait for an absolution...

2065
02:58:53,634 --> 02:58:55,477
that would never come.

2066
02:59:59,700 --> 03:00:02,320
Sir, I don't think you'll find
any of your people down here.

2067
03:00:02,420 --> 03:00:03,750
It's all steerage.

2068
03:00:06,707 --> 03:00:10,320
His hair is reddish brown,
reddish brown, reddish brown.

2069
03:00:10,420 --> 03:00:11,755
White beard.

2070
03:00:12,213 --> 03:00:13,820
Isn't there another passenger list?

2071
03:00:13,920 --> 03:00:15,120
There is no other list.

2072
03:00:15,220 --> 03:00:16,596
Perhaps he's on another ship.

2073
03:00:16,884 --> 03:00:18,727
We're doing all we can, ma'am. I'm so sorry.

2074
03:00:42,076 --> 03:00:44,750
That's the last time I ever saw him.

2075
03:00:45,246 --> 03:00:48,750
He married, of course,
and inherited his millions.

2076
03:00:49,417 --> 03:00:52,921
But the Crash of '29
hit his interests hard...

2077
03:00:53,254 --> 03:00:55,552
and he put a pistol in his mouth that year.

2078
03:00:56,090 --> 03:00:57,933
Or so I read.

2079
03:01:10,770 --> 03:01:12,239
Can I take your name please, love?

2080
03:01:15,276 --> 03:01:16,619
Dawson.

2081
03:01:18,779 --> 03:01:20,281
Rose Dawson.

2082
03:01:21,616 --> 03:01:22,788
Thank you.

2083
03:01:29,790 --> 03:01:32,020
We never found anything on Jack.

2084
03:01:32,120 --> 03:01:34,007
There's no record of him at all.

2085
03:01:34,629 --> 03:01:36,973
No, there wouldn't be, would there?

2086
03:01:37,298 --> 03:01:40,017
And I've never spoken of him until now.

2087
03:01:40,760 --> 03:01:41,807
Not to anyone.

2088
03:01:42,970 --> 03:01:44,972
Not even your grandfather.

2089
03:01:45,306 --> 03:01:49,311
A woman's heart is a deep ocean of secrets.

2090
03:01:50,144 --> 03:01:53,819
But now you know there was
a man named Jack Dawson...

2091
03:01:54,148 --> 03:01:56,150
and that he saved me...

2092
03:01:56,484 --> 03:01:59,829
in every way that a person can be saved.

2093
03:02:01,822 --> 03:02:04,496
I don't even have a picture of him.

2094
03:02:06,994 --> 03:02:10,840
He exists now only in my memory.

2095
03:02:15,670 --> 03:02:19,174
Keldysh, Mir 2 on our way to the surface.

2096
03:02:35,690 --> 03:02:38,489
I was saving this for
when I found the diamond.

2097
03:02:47,868 --> 03:02:49,370
I'm sorry.

2098
03:02:52,039 --> 03:02:53,541
Three years...

2099
03:02:54,208 --> 03:02:56,882
I've thought of nothing except Titanic.

2100
03:02:57,712 --> 03:02:59,555
But I never got it.

2101
03:03:02,675 --> 03:03:04,552
I never let it in.
