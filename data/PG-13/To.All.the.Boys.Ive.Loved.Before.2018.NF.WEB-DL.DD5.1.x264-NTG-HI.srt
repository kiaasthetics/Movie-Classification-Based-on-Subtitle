1
00:00:23,023 --> 00:00:24,191
girl The forbidden kiss.

2
00:00:28,654 --> 00:00:30,197
We knew that it was wrong,

3
00:00:32,491 --> 00:00:34,785
that he was betrothed to my sister.

4
00:00:36,828 --> 00:00:38,956
But if this wasn't what he wanted,

5
00:00:40,415 --> 00:00:42,793
then why did he come
to the field of desire?

6
00:00:44,628 --> 00:00:45,671
It was fated,

7
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:48,674
that we should meet like this.

8
00:00:49,007 --> 00:00:50,008
Hey!

9
00:00:50,676 --> 00:00:52,386
Are we hanging out or what?

10
00:00:54,346 --> 00:00:56,431
I just want to finish this chapter.

11
00:00:58,058 --> 00:01:00,310
dishes clattering

12
00:01:00,394 --> 00:01:01,478
Oh!

13
00:01:04,273 --> 00:01:06,233
Should we go down and help him?

14
00:01:06,316 --> 00:01:09,444
He wants to do it himself,
but please come help me set the table.

15
00:01:10,237 --> 00:01:14,074
I hate when Dad makes Korean food,
it always tastes like butt.

16
00:01:14,157 --> 00:01:17,494
Regardless, whatever Dad puts
in front of you, take a bite

17
00:01:17,578 --> 00:01:19,621
and say, "Mm, just like Mom's," okay?

18
00:01:19,705 --> 00:01:21,999
I was still eating smushed peas
when Mom died.

19
00:01:22,082 --> 00:01:23,542
knock at door

20
00:01:23,625 --> 00:01:24,668
- Hey.
- Hey!

21
00:01:24,751 --> 00:01:26,169
I'm not too late, am I?

22
00:01:26,253 --> 00:01:29,631
I was trying to meditate,
but I ended up falling asleep.

23
00:01:31,675 --> 00:01:34,136
- Smells good, Dr. C.
- Hey, Josh.

24
00:01:35,053 --> 00:01:36,054
Lara Jean.

25
00:01:37,556 --> 00:01:39,641
So, uh... What you cooking?

26
00:01:42,644 --> 00:01:46,857
- If you just rock thisÂ back and forth...
- It's supposed to fall off the bone.

27
00:01:46,940 --> 00:01:50,193
Hey, Josh, come hang on to this
while I saw, would ya?

28
00:01:50,277 --> 00:01:54,239
Electric knife's in the kitchen,
it'll have that ready in two seconds.

29
00:01:54,323 --> 00:01:56,158
Looks great, Daddy. I'll be back.

30
00:01:56,241 --> 00:01:59,828
I can't believe we're not going
to see her until Thanksgiving.

31
00:01:59,911 --> 00:02:04,207
Christmas actually, Scotland's too far
to come back for Thanksgiving.

32
00:02:04,291 --> 00:02:07,127
Wait, are you kidding?
We're not gonna see her till Christmas!

33
00:02:07,210 --> 00:02:08,629
Look on the bright side,

34
00:02:08,712 --> 00:02:12,007
Margot won't be taking the car every day,
you can practice your driving.

35
00:02:12,090 --> 00:02:16,053
- I forgot I had to drive with Lara now.
- Feel free to take the bus.

36
00:02:16,136 --> 00:02:19,765
I can give you a ride.
I'm not disappearing, I'm next door.

37
00:02:20,349 --> 00:02:21,391
Or I can drive,

38
00:02:21,475 --> 00:02:24,394
and if we get pulled over,
we'll switch places real quick.

39
00:02:24,478 --> 00:02:27,064
- Top-notch idea, honey.
- What'd I miss?

40
00:02:27,147 --> 00:02:29,816
We were talking
about what a bad driver Lara Jean is.

41
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:33,403
Yeah, we were,
but we were also talking about airplanes,

42
00:02:33,487 --> 00:02:36,406
which speaking of...
I have a surprise for you.

43
00:02:36,490 --> 00:02:37,574
Oh...

44
00:02:38,408 --> 00:02:42,162
You couldn't come home for Thanksgiving,
I figured I'd bring home to you.

45
00:02:43,163 --> 00:02:45,749
It's a plane ticket,
I'm coming to Scotland.

46
00:02:45,832 --> 00:02:47,959
Look at Josh stepping up!

47
00:02:48,585 --> 00:02:50,545
You... You already paid for this?

48
00:02:52,005 --> 00:02:54,132
Yeah, I had a Google alert set for flights

49
00:02:54,216 --> 00:02:57,511
as soon as you decided
you wanted to go to school there.

50
00:02:58,136 --> 00:02:59,388
Why?

51
00:03:05,310 --> 00:03:07,854
Mm... Just like Mom's.

52
00:03:09,564 --> 00:03:12,359
Lara Jean I guess I should tell you
a little bit about Josh.

53
00:03:12,943 --> 00:03:16,071
He and Margot have been together
for the past two years,

54
00:03:16,154 --> 00:03:19,032
but before Margot even cared
that he existed,

55
00:03:19,408 --> 00:03:21,076
he was my first boyfriend.

56
00:03:21,326 --> 00:03:23,495
Well, space between the words...

57
00:03:24,162 --> 00:03:25,497
boy who was a friend.

58
00:03:26,957 --> 00:03:31,211
I could talk to him about anything.
We really understood one another.

59
00:03:31,294 --> 00:03:35,757
Okay, would you rather only drink water
for the rest of your life,

60
00:03:35,841 --> 00:03:39,845
or you can drink whatever you want,
but it has to have a drop of pee in it?

61
00:03:39,928 --> 00:03:41,221
Clear or yellow?

62
00:03:42,347 --> 00:03:44,099
It has to be a little yellow.

63
00:03:44,599 --> 00:03:48,437
I mean, pee. Definitely pee.
I can't give up Mountain Dew.

64
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:51,106
Yeah, definitely. Pee's the only answer.

65
00:03:51,189 --> 00:03:54,276
We didn't stop being friends
when Josh and Margot got together,

66
00:03:54,359 --> 00:03:55,694
it was just different.

67
00:03:55,777 --> 00:03:57,404
Water. Definitely water.

68
00:03:58,739 --> 00:04:00,282
Yeah, me too.

69
00:04:01,074 --> 00:04:02,075
Definitely.

70
00:04:02,617 --> 00:04:06,747
They didn't want me to feel left out,
so they invited me everywhere...

71
00:04:07,414 --> 00:04:08,582
even on dates.

72
00:04:10,041 --> 00:04:13,295
They tried to make it
as normal as possible, but...

73
00:04:14,546 --> 00:04:16,465
I still felt like a third wheel.

74
00:04:18,216 --> 00:04:21,219
It's not that I wanted to steal
my sister's boyfriend or anything.

75
00:04:21,303 --> 00:04:25,474
I was super happy for Margot.
She deserves a great guy like Josh.

76
00:04:25,849 --> 00:04:27,851
And so I wrote him a letter.

77
00:04:27,934 --> 00:04:29,853
I wasn't going to send the letter,

78
00:04:29,936 --> 00:04:32,939
it was just for me
to understand how I was feeling.

79
00:04:33,231 --> 00:04:37,068
But really, I guess it was mainly
about how sometimes I imagined

80
00:04:37,152 --> 00:04:40,989
what it would've been like if I'd realized
how I felt about him sooner.

81
00:04:41,072 --> 00:04:43,200
Margot...making me look
like the bad guy.

82
00:04:43,283 --> 00:04:46,953
- Josh You know how hard that was?
- You shouldn't have in front of them!

83
00:04:50,457 --> 00:04:53,335
My letters are my most secret possessions.

84
00:04:53,418 --> 00:04:54,795
There are five total:

85
00:04:54,878 --> 00:04:56,338
Kenny from camp;

86
00:04:56,421 --> 00:04:58,006
Peter from seventh grade;

87
00:04:58,089 --> 00:04:59,508
Lucas from Homecoming;

88
00:04:59,591 --> 00:05:01,635
John Ambrose from Model UN;

89
00:05:01,718 --> 00:05:02,719
and Josh.

90
00:05:04,721 --> 00:05:08,725
I write a letter when I have a crush
so intense I don't know what else to do.

91
00:05:09,309 --> 00:05:13,563
Rereading my letters reminds me
of how powerful my emotions can be,

92
00:05:13,647 --> 00:05:14,731
how all-consuming.

93
00:05:15,649 --> 00:05:19,903
And Margot would say I'm being dramatic,
but I think drama can be fun...

94
00:05:19,986 --> 00:05:21,780
- What are you doing?
- Nothing.

95
00:05:21,863 --> 00:05:24,449
Just as long
as nobody else knows about it.

96
00:05:28,537 --> 00:05:29,746
Your room's a mess.

97
00:05:42,717 --> 00:05:43,718
Are you okay?

98
00:05:44,511 --> 00:05:45,512
Yeah.

99
00:05:46,179 --> 00:05:47,180
Well...

100
00:05:48,014 --> 00:05:51,059
I don't know, I just broke up with Josh.

101
00:05:51,476 --> 00:05:52,477
You did what?

102
00:05:53,311 --> 00:05:54,521
Why?

103
00:05:56,648 --> 00:06:01,319
Before Mom died, she said I should never
go to college with a boyfriend.

104
00:06:02,737 --> 00:06:03,947
But you love him.

105
00:06:05,031 --> 00:06:06,032
I know.

106
00:06:08,743 --> 00:06:12,038
So, do you think
you might change your mind?

107
00:06:19,504 --> 00:06:20,505
No.

108
00:06:21,381 --> 00:06:22,507
No, never.

109
00:06:24,509 --> 00:06:26,344
When I was packing for college,

110
00:06:26,428 --> 00:06:29,389
I had Daddy make a box of things
to take to Goodwill.

111
00:06:29,681 --> 00:06:32,434
I think you should do it too,
I made you a box.

112
00:06:33,310 --> 00:06:37,731
I don't really think there's anything
I can part with at the moment.

113
00:06:37,814 --> 00:06:40,025
Lara Jean, I'm leaving tomorrow.

114
00:06:40,108 --> 00:06:43,028
That means
you're going to be the biggest sister.

115
00:06:43,111 --> 00:06:45,655
You need to set a good example
for Kitty,

116
00:06:45,739 --> 00:06:47,699
no gorging on chips before dinner

117
00:06:48,241 --> 00:06:49,284
and a clean room.

118
00:06:51,036 --> 00:06:53,496
Can we go back to talking
about how you're sad?

119
00:07:20,690 --> 00:07:23,777
Lara Jean Margot says
when something is no longer useful,

120
00:07:23,860 --> 00:07:26,905
you either donate it,
recycle it, or throw it away.

121
00:07:26,988 --> 00:07:30,158
I always knew she felt that way
about objects but...

122
00:07:32,452 --> 00:07:35,497
I didn't think she could feel that
about a person.

123
00:07:42,837 --> 00:07:45,340
airport announcer
...will depart from Gate 39.

124
00:07:46,883 --> 00:07:47,884
Come here.

125
00:07:57,644 --> 00:08:00,689
Hey, you need a magazine.
We'll be right back.

126
00:08:04,234 --> 00:08:05,318
You gonna be okay?

127
00:08:06,027 --> 00:08:09,030
Did you have to pick the furthest college
you could think of?

128
00:08:10,281 --> 00:08:12,325
Who am I supposed to eat lunch with?

129
00:08:12,409 --> 00:08:15,537
I think you should look at this
as an opportunity to branch out,

130
00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:16,997
- make new friends.
- No.

131
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:20,792
- You never know what could happen.
- That's what I'm afraid of.

132
00:08:20,875 --> 00:08:23,294
If you need me, I'm a Skype call away.

133
00:08:23,628 --> 00:08:26,423
Until you start going to pubs
and eating haggis

134
00:08:26,506 --> 00:08:28,925
with your Scottish friends,
and forget about us.

135
00:08:29,009 --> 00:08:32,137
I can promise you I will never, ever...

136
00:08:32,512 --> 00:08:33,513
eat haggis.

137
00:08:33,596 --> 00:08:36,641
We couldn't decide,
so we got you all of them.

138
00:08:36,725 --> 00:08:38,226
That's Road & Track,

139
00:08:38,309 --> 00:08:42,981
it doesn't sound that interesting,
but if you stick with it... Come here.

140
00:08:49,279 --> 00:08:51,072
Alright, I gotta go.

141
00:08:55,452 --> 00:08:56,661
Okay.

142
00:09:03,877 --> 00:09:05,462
Think she'll turn around?

143
00:09:08,631 --> 00:09:10,008
No, that's not Margot.

144
00:09:17,140 --> 00:09:18,600
Can we have a dog now?

145
00:09:19,684 --> 00:09:21,686
No, but that's a nice try.

146
00:09:21,770 --> 00:09:23,772
"Chinatown" by Wild Nothing plays

147
00:09:29,652 --> 00:09:32,363
âª Innocent love âª

148
00:09:32,447 --> 00:09:35,825
âª I need to go somewhere âª

149
00:09:35,909 --> 00:09:39,871
âª I need somewhere to come down âª

150
00:09:39,954 --> 00:09:43,833
âª I need some way to make you smile âª

151
00:09:49,339 --> 00:09:52,717
Lara Jean. It's only gonna take
a second. Just smile.

152
00:09:52,801 --> 00:09:54,636
- Cheese!
- camera shutter snapping

153
00:09:57,514 --> 00:10:00,558
Sixth grade and junior year,
can hardly believe it.

154
00:10:00,642 --> 00:10:02,143
Okay, you ready to go?

155
00:10:02,602 --> 00:10:03,728
One sec.

156
00:10:05,230 --> 00:10:06,231
Give me those.

157
00:10:07,398 --> 00:10:10,318
Okay, just drive safe. I gotta go.

158
00:10:11,319 --> 00:10:12,320
You look great.

159
00:10:12,987 --> 00:10:13,822
Alright.

160
00:10:16,908 --> 00:10:17,992
All set.

161
00:10:18,118 --> 00:10:20,411
- That's very funny.
- Very necessary.

162
00:10:22,789 --> 00:10:25,750
âª One of a kind âª

163
00:10:25,834 --> 00:10:29,504
âª I need to keep you here âª

164
00:10:29,587 --> 00:10:33,258
âª I need to picture you still âª

165
00:10:33,341 --> 00:10:36,511
âª I need to...
Nothing but the foggiest day âª

166
00:10:36,594 --> 00:10:39,139
- Ow! Excuse you.
- Oh, my God, Gen.

167
00:10:39,222 --> 00:10:41,599
I'm so sorry, I wasn't paying attention.

168
00:10:41,683 --> 00:10:42,767
Oh, it's you.

169
00:10:43,935 --> 00:10:44,936
Gen...

170
00:10:45,019 --> 00:10:46,104
Genevieve.

171
00:10:46,187 --> 00:10:49,274
We used to be best friends,
but post-middle school,

172
00:10:49,357 --> 00:10:53,486
for reasons having to do
with her popularity and my lack thereof,

173
00:10:53,570 --> 00:10:56,447
we are now decidedly not.

174
00:10:56,531 --> 00:10:57,615
Cute boots.

175
00:10:58,241 --> 00:11:00,326
Thank you so much for your service.

176
00:11:00,910 --> 00:11:03,454
They're vintage, but I got them on Etsy.

177
00:11:04,205 --> 00:11:05,790
And they're amazing!

178
00:11:05,874 --> 00:11:07,917
Not everybody can pull them off.

179
00:11:08,209 --> 00:11:09,961
Lara Jean can rock 'em!

180
00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:12,130
But for you, cuz, well,

181
00:11:12,213 --> 00:11:18,136
let's just say it's probably a good thing
you're playing it safe with those Uggs.

182
00:11:18,511 --> 00:11:20,471
Christine. Chris...

183
00:11:20,555 --> 00:11:23,892
Gen's cousin, my best friend.
My only friend, really.

184
00:11:23,975 --> 00:11:27,645
Know what, Chrissie? Screw you,
you know my feet are always cold.

185
00:11:27,729 --> 00:11:28,813
- Hey, babe.
- Oh!

186
00:11:28,897 --> 00:11:30,398
- Hi.
- How you doing?

187
00:11:30,481 --> 00:11:32,275
- I'm good. How are you?
- Good.

188
00:11:32,692 --> 00:11:33,943
Remember Peter,

189
00:11:34,027 --> 00:11:37,030
the second non-recipient
of one of my love letters?

190
00:11:37,113 --> 00:11:39,449
That's this Peter. Gen's Peter.

191
00:11:41,075 --> 00:11:44,287
Seventh grade,
my first real boy/girl party.

192
00:11:44,746 --> 00:11:48,750
Everyone knew that Peter and Gen,
who at the time was still my BFF,

193
00:11:48,833 --> 00:11:50,501
only wanted to kiss each other.

194
00:11:50,585 --> 00:11:51,628
I can spin it again.

195
00:11:52,295 --> 00:11:53,755
You can't cheat the bottle.

196
00:12:02,347 --> 00:12:07,143
So I was just complimenting Lara Jean
on her government-issued boots.

197
00:12:07,727 --> 00:12:10,438
Come on,
I see someone we need to say hi to.

198
00:12:10,521 --> 00:12:12,190
- Bye!
- What...

199
00:12:14,442 --> 00:12:17,070
She just stopped drinking caffeine
for some diet,

200
00:12:17,153 --> 00:12:18,821
I think she's in withdrawal.

201
00:12:18,905 --> 00:12:21,950
Are you sure she just doesn't have
a chemical imbalance?

202
00:12:23,034 --> 00:12:24,035
Right...

203
00:12:27,038 --> 00:12:29,290
Really think my boots are amazing?

204
00:12:29,374 --> 00:12:32,293
If you ask, it ruins the whole vibe.
Be cool.

205
00:12:32,377 --> 00:12:36,130
Anyway, you think I'm gonna
let my cousin talk trash about you?

206
00:12:37,715 --> 00:12:39,717
school bell rings

207
00:12:40,134 --> 00:12:43,054
"You're Not Good Enough"
by Blood Orange plays

208
00:12:48,768 --> 00:12:51,521
âª Deep in the play âª

209
00:12:51,604 --> 00:12:54,941
âª I see you as you are looking over âª

210
00:12:56,734 --> 00:12:58,736
âª Friends in my way âª

211
00:12:59,529 --> 00:13:02,699
âª You never could have been a good lover âª

212
00:13:04,742 --> 00:13:06,744
âª Watch what you say âª

213
00:13:07,537 --> 00:13:11,040
âª Could never mean a word
And still hurt you âª

214
00:13:12,667 --> 00:13:14,419
âª Look the other way âª

215
00:13:15,378 --> 00:13:19,549
âª Please tell me that I am wrong
So wrong âª

216
00:13:21,467 --> 00:13:23,553
âª I never was in love âª

217
00:13:23,636 --> 00:13:27,724
âª You know that you were
Never good enough âª

218
00:13:28,891 --> 00:13:31,311
âª Fall asleep right next to me âª

219
00:13:31,394 --> 00:13:32,353
carrot crunches loudly

220
00:13:32,437 --> 00:13:35,606
âª You know that you were
Never good enough âª

221
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:39,527
âª I never was in love âª

222
00:13:39,610 --> 00:13:43,698
âª You know that you were
Never good enough âª

223
00:13:50,663 --> 00:13:51,664
Hey.

224
00:13:52,415 --> 00:13:53,833
Um, is this seat taken?

225
00:13:54,709 --> 00:13:55,710
Yeah...

226
00:13:55,793 --> 00:13:57,170
Well, by you.

227
00:14:03,968 --> 00:14:04,802
I...

228
00:14:05,386 --> 00:14:08,806
I gotta ask...
did she tell you she was gonna do it?

229
00:14:09,974 --> 00:14:14,062
Because I just figure you guys
talk about everything, right? So...

230
00:14:14,937 --> 00:14:16,564
She didn't tell me about this.

231
00:14:20,193 --> 00:14:21,652
We're still cool, right?

232
00:14:22,820 --> 00:14:23,946
We can still talk and...

233
00:14:25,782 --> 00:14:27,200
you know, kick it?

234
00:14:28,618 --> 00:14:30,620
Ugh... Don't say "kick it."

235
00:14:33,039 --> 00:14:34,123
Yes, we are cool.

236
00:14:35,958 --> 00:14:36,959
Good.

237
00:14:38,378 --> 00:14:39,253
Good.

238
00:14:40,838 --> 00:14:42,090
Do you want a carrot?

239
00:14:44,092 --> 00:14:45,259
Give me a carrot.

240
00:14:48,429 --> 00:14:50,306
I know what you're thinking,

241
00:14:50,390 --> 00:14:52,600
but we really were cool.

242
00:14:53,351 --> 00:14:55,061
However I felt about Josh...

243
00:14:55,144 --> 00:14:56,354
New album.

244
00:14:56,437 --> 00:14:58,439
...I would never do that to Margot.

245
00:15:00,441 --> 00:15:03,069
The middle school cafeteria
is so ginormous.

246
00:15:03,152 --> 00:15:06,406
Alison wanted to sit at lunch,
but so did Brianna and Katy.

247
00:15:06,489 --> 00:15:09,575
I ended up rotating so everyone had time
next to me, you know?

248
00:15:09,659 --> 00:15:11,869
Yeah, I can totally relate.

249
00:15:20,711 --> 00:15:21,712
Really?

250
00:15:22,255 --> 00:15:23,256
Course.

251
00:15:28,469 --> 00:15:29,554
boy Whoa, whoa, whoa!

252
00:15:32,181 --> 00:15:34,434
Good thing I'm wearing my helmet!

253
00:15:42,775 --> 00:15:43,943
- Hi.
- Hi.

254
00:15:44,026 --> 00:15:45,403
- How you doing?
- Good.

255
00:15:45,486 --> 00:15:46,571
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

256
00:15:46,654 --> 00:15:50,366
You know people usually check behind them
before they reverse

257
00:15:50,450 --> 00:15:53,077
to avoid killing others,
it's a thing we do.

258
00:15:53,161 --> 00:15:57,957
Yeah, I'm just not completely comfortable
with using my mirrors yet, so...

259
00:15:58,040 --> 00:15:59,041
Yeah, clearly.

260
00:15:59,542 --> 00:16:02,503
Think you're gonna be able
to make it out of the parking lot?

261
00:16:02,587 --> 00:16:04,964
Yeah. We're fine.

262
00:16:05,631 --> 00:16:06,924
Really, seriously.

263
00:16:07,175 --> 00:16:08,968
Um, so you should just...

264
00:16:09,635 --> 00:16:10,636
go, seriously.

265
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:14,223
Sure, whatever you say, Covey.
Hey, you're in charge.

266
00:16:21,022 --> 00:16:22,106
Who was that?

267
00:16:22,648 --> 00:16:24,066
That was Peter Kavinsky.

268
00:16:26,486 --> 00:16:29,739
- What are we waiting for?
- The rest of the cars to leave.

269
00:16:30,239 --> 00:16:31,240
Oh, my gosh.

270
00:16:32,325 --> 00:16:34,827
Blanche, you simply have to help me.

271
00:16:35,411 --> 00:16:38,498
- What do you think Margot's doing tonight?
- Crack.

272
00:16:39,123 --> 00:16:40,958
Kitty, why would you say that?

273
00:16:41,042 --> 00:16:44,712
It's how Scottish people say fun.
Like, "You're a good craic."

274
00:16:45,087 --> 00:16:46,088
I looked it up.

275
00:16:46,672 --> 00:16:48,758
It's weird not having her here, huh?

276
00:16:49,342 --> 00:16:51,552
It's weird not having Josh here, too.

277
00:16:52,136 --> 00:16:54,013
I miss his Blanche impression.

278
00:16:54,096 --> 00:16:55,223
How many boyfriends

279
00:16:55,306 --> 00:16:58,309
could a naive farmer's daughter
possibly have had?

280
00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:00,520
Fifty-six.

281
00:17:04,815 --> 00:17:05,816
Excuse me?

282
00:17:07,401 --> 00:17:08,402
You know,

283
00:17:08,778 --> 00:17:14,242
Lara Jean, if you had a boyfriend,
maybe you wouldn't have to drive at all

284
00:17:14,325 --> 00:17:15,993
'cause he would take us places.

285
00:17:16,077 --> 00:17:18,621
If that's what it takes,
I think you're stuck with me.

286
00:17:18,704 --> 00:17:21,791
I dunno. What about the guy
you almost killed the other day?

287
00:17:22,750 --> 00:17:23,876
He's dating Gen.

288
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:24,961
So?

289
00:17:27,213 --> 00:17:28,798
It's not just that...

290
00:17:33,261 --> 00:17:39,767
Don't you find it kinda depressing
that it's Saturday night,

291
00:17:39,850 --> 00:17:43,771
and you're having a Golden Girls marathon
with your little sister?

292
00:17:43,854 --> 00:17:47,483
No. I love the Golden Girls,
and I love hanging out with you.

293
00:17:49,026 --> 00:17:50,027
Okay,

294
00:17:50,444 --> 00:17:53,990
I'm not telling you this
to make you feel bad,

295
00:17:54,824 --> 00:17:56,909
but, Lara Jean,

296
00:17:57,577 --> 00:18:01,831
I'm 11 and I canceled plans

297
00:18:02,331 --> 00:18:03,624
to be here tonight.

298
00:18:03,708 --> 00:18:06,502
And well, you're 16,

299
00:18:07,211 --> 00:18:10,298
and I don't think
you had anything else going on,

300
00:18:10,881 --> 00:18:11,882
am I right?

301
00:18:13,634 --> 00:18:15,428
That is way harsh, Kitty.

302
00:18:16,345 --> 00:18:17,972
The truth hurts, Lara Jean.

303
00:18:53,466 --> 00:18:54,842
What'd you do last night?

304
00:18:54,925 --> 00:18:57,178
I finished another book. It was so good.

305
00:18:57,261 --> 00:18:59,055
Another bodice ripper, you little perv.

306
00:18:59,138 --> 00:19:01,682
- I enjoy them for their camp.
- Yeah, right!

307
00:19:01,766 --> 00:19:05,227
- Don't worry, girl, no judgment.
- Hey! Can I talk to you?

308
00:19:05,311 --> 00:19:07,104
- Um, me?
- Yeah.

309
00:19:07,188 --> 00:19:11,734
Hey, PK, I heard my cousin dumped you
for a college student, that true?

310
00:19:12,151 --> 00:19:16,322
- I heard you have a tail.
- Yep, really cute. Like a little piggy.

311
00:19:16,405 --> 00:19:19,033
I need to talk to...
I need to talk to Lara Jean.

312
00:19:19,950 --> 00:19:20,951
Alone.

313
00:19:24,497 --> 00:19:25,498
If you need me,

314
00:19:25,581 --> 00:19:27,625
I'll be in the nurse's office,

315
00:19:28,376 --> 00:19:29,919
with a migraine,

316
00:19:30,002 --> 00:19:32,129
Googling Justin Trudeau shirtless.

317
00:19:32,588 --> 00:19:35,091
Look, I wanted to say that I really...

318
00:19:35,716 --> 00:19:38,386
I appreciate it,
but it's never gonna happen.

319
00:19:39,136 --> 00:19:40,179
I'm sorry, what?

320
00:19:40,763 --> 00:19:45,851
From what I remember that kiss was hot,
you know, for being in seventh grade,

321
00:19:45,935 --> 00:19:51,482
and I think it's really cool you think
I have golden specks in my eyes.

322
00:19:53,150 --> 00:19:56,696
echoing It's just, Gen and I are in
a really weird place right now.

323
00:19:57,863 --> 00:20:00,408
distorted I don't know
what you hoped to accomplish. Whoa!

324
00:20:03,494 --> 00:20:04,495
Hey, Lara Jean.

325
00:20:06,122 --> 00:20:07,123
Lara Jean!

326
00:20:07,707 --> 00:20:08,958
Lara Jean, wake up.

327
00:20:09,917 --> 00:20:13,045
Hello? Hey, can I get some help over here?

328
00:20:13,838 --> 00:20:15,464
Hey. Hey...

329
00:20:15,923 --> 00:20:16,924
Wake up!

330
00:20:18,384 --> 00:20:19,468
Are you okay?

331
00:20:20,052 --> 00:20:22,513
- What happened?
- You fainted.

332
00:20:23,013 --> 00:20:25,182
Oh... Okay.

333
00:20:26,559 --> 00:20:29,478
Here, give me your hand.
And the other one, too.

334
00:20:29,562 --> 00:20:32,690
Come on, you got this.
Here we go. And you're up.

335
00:20:32,773 --> 00:20:35,109
Want me to call someone,
get you some water?

336
00:20:36,152 --> 00:20:37,653
No, I'm okay.

337
00:20:38,362 --> 00:20:39,363
You sure?

338
00:20:46,287 --> 00:20:47,371
Oh, my God.

339
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:52,501
Oh, my God!

340
00:20:53,002 --> 00:20:54,295
Oh... Okay. Wha...

341
00:20:56,797 --> 00:20:57,798
Hey!

342
00:20:58,716 --> 00:20:59,717
Stop that!

343
00:20:59,925 --> 00:21:01,635
Two more laps for you, Covey!

344
00:21:03,345 --> 00:21:04,972
- Thank you.
- Wait... Wha...

345
00:21:05,598 --> 00:21:06,599
Uh, I...

346
00:21:09,477 --> 00:21:10,478
Lara Jean!

347
00:21:24,325 --> 00:21:26,202
boy Hey, Lara Jean, you in there?

348
00:21:28,037 --> 00:21:29,038
No.

349
00:21:32,750 --> 00:21:34,752
"Human Right" by The Strike plays

350
00:21:36,045 --> 00:21:37,213
Hi, Lucas.

351
00:21:37,922 --> 00:21:38,964
Hey, Lara Jean.

352
00:21:44,345 --> 00:21:46,764
That ascot looks really cool on you.

353
00:21:46,847 --> 00:21:48,307
Oh, yeah. Thanks.

354
00:21:49,099 --> 00:21:50,684
It's actually a cravat.

355
00:21:53,229 --> 00:21:55,147
I really like your braid crown.

356
00:21:55,481 --> 00:21:57,191
Oh, cool. Cool.

357
00:21:57,316 --> 00:21:58,818
My sister did it for me.

358
00:21:59,610 --> 00:22:01,028
I... It's dope.

359
00:22:04,824 --> 00:22:06,408
Do you maybe wanna dance?

360
00:22:08,619 --> 00:22:11,664
Oh, my God. I never thought you'd ask!

361
00:22:30,099 --> 00:22:32,268
Look, I didn't mean to barge in on you.

362
00:22:32,351 --> 00:22:35,938
I saw you run in here and I wanted
to make sure you're OK, and, uh...

363
00:22:36,939 --> 00:22:39,984
thought you might want that back.
It seemed a little personal.

364
00:22:40,651 --> 00:22:42,695
Lucas, I wrote this years ago.

365
00:22:42,778 --> 00:22:44,572
Freshman homecoming, right?

366
00:22:48,325 --> 00:22:50,661
I had a lot of fun that night, too.

367
00:22:52,746 --> 00:22:56,834
But I feel like I should tell you, though,
you know I'm gay, right?

368
00:22:56,917 --> 00:22:57,960
I did not.

369
00:22:58,961 --> 00:23:02,506
Yes. Of course, yes. I... I did. I did.

370
00:23:03,090 --> 00:23:07,052
But don't like tell anyone, though.
I'm out and I'm not ashamed.

371
00:23:07,136 --> 00:23:08,554
You know, my mom knows.

372
00:23:08,846 --> 00:23:11,140
My dad kinda knows.

373
00:23:12,141 --> 00:23:13,350
It's just...

374
00:23:14,435 --> 00:23:16,562
- High school.
- High school. Yeah.

375
00:23:27,698 --> 00:23:28,866
Hey, sweetheart.

376
00:23:28,949 --> 00:23:29,950
Hi, Dad.

377
00:23:30,034 --> 00:23:31,076
All good?

378
00:23:33,662 --> 00:23:38,083
Have you seen a green box? It has fabric
on top, it's round, there's a bow on it.

379
00:23:38,167 --> 00:23:41,670
Wow. No "hi, Dad,"
no "why are you home early?"

380
00:23:41,754 --> 00:23:45,049
Maybe because your patient delivered
in under six hours,

381
00:23:45,132 --> 00:23:48,302
you brought a new life into the world,
and you're home to...

382
00:23:48,385 --> 00:23:52,473
I really need to know.
Mom gave it to me. It's very important.

383
00:23:52,556 --> 00:23:55,851
I don't know. Maybe it went out
with the Goodwill boxes.

384
00:23:58,020 --> 00:23:59,188
The Goodwill boxes?

385
00:24:03,817 --> 00:24:05,527
No, no.

386
00:24:05,611 --> 00:24:07,446
Hey, you got some mail.

387
00:24:14,161 --> 00:24:15,579
This is all your fault!

388
00:24:16,747 --> 00:24:17,957
I hate everyone!

389
00:24:20,334 --> 00:24:21,460
What's her problem?

390
00:24:21,835 --> 00:24:22,920
Moon day?

391
00:24:23,212 --> 00:24:24,338
Moon day?

392
00:24:24,588 --> 00:24:27,800
Menstruation is science,
nothing to do with the moon.

393
00:24:28,008 --> 00:24:30,260
Says you, doctor man!

394
00:24:30,386 --> 00:24:32,846
But the Goddess within says
it's a sacred rhythm

395
00:24:32,930 --> 00:24:35,557
that represents the deepest celebration
of womanhood.

396
00:24:37,059 --> 00:24:40,646
The letters are out. They're out.
There's nothing you can do about it.

397
00:24:40,729 --> 00:24:44,108
Silver lining,
Kenny's letter was addressed to camp,

398
00:24:44,191 --> 00:24:48,529
so at least he'll never find out how hard
you were crushing after Chubby Bunny.

399
00:24:48,612 --> 00:24:50,072
You really oughta relax.

400
00:24:51,198 --> 00:24:52,574
I know you love me.

401
00:24:53,158 --> 00:24:54,868
Loved, past tense.

402
00:24:54,952 --> 00:24:56,245
You're Margot's.

403
00:24:56,787 --> 00:24:59,164
Dear Josh, I lie awake at night

404
00:24:59,248 --> 00:25:01,709
and imagine running my fingers
through your hair.

405
00:25:02,334 --> 00:25:04,586
- Feeling your strong arms aro...
- Shut up!

406
00:25:05,754 --> 00:25:06,797
You're not real.

407
00:25:08,716 --> 00:25:10,718
- I'm more real to you than he is.
- doorbell rings

408
00:25:11,260 --> 00:25:12,594
What are you doing?

409
00:25:14,805 --> 00:25:15,806
Nothing.

410
00:25:17,266 --> 00:25:19,309
Lara Jean, Josh is here.

411
00:25:20,019 --> 00:25:21,020
You never saw me!

412
00:25:29,361 --> 00:25:30,362
Ow!

413
00:25:30,821 --> 00:25:33,282
Ow, ow, ow. Ow!

414
00:26:01,518 --> 00:26:02,603
Hey, Covey.

415
00:26:06,940 --> 00:26:09,485
Oh... Anything for your friend?

416
00:26:09,568 --> 00:26:10,569
He's not with me.

417
00:26:10,652 --> 00:26:12,738
I'd like a chocolate shake. Thanks.

418
00:26:12,821 --> 00:26:13,822
- Sure.
- Yeah.

419
00:26:16,617 --> 00:26:18,035
So what you doing here?

420
00:26:18,118 --> 00:26:21,497
I'm just here to take down
one of those chocolate shakes.

421
00:26:21,580 --> 00:26:22,498
Cool.

422
00:26:22,998 --> 00:26:27,544
Actually, I stopped at your house,
your sister said you'd probably be here.

423
00:26:27,628 --> 00:26:30,380
Look, I just wanna be super clear.

424
00:26:30,964 --> 00:26:31,965
- Okay.
- Okay?

425
00:26:32,049 --> 00:26:34,468
I'm flattered, I am, but...

426
00:26:35,385 --> 00:26:37,554
Gen and I, like, just broke up so...

427
00:26:37,638 --> 00:26:39,306
Are you trying to reject me?

428
00:26:39,389 --> 00:26:42,768
Yeah, it didn't really seem like it took
the first time.

429
00:26:42,851 --> 00:26:45,312
Peter Kavinsky,
I'm not trying to date you.

430
00:26:45,395 --> 00:26:49,858
Your mouth is saying something,
but your mouth said something different.

431
00:26:50,442 --> 00:26:51,276
What?

432
00:26:53,028 --> 00:26:55,239
Thank you, uh... Joan.

433
00:26:59,618 --> 00:27:03,997
Okay, um... So here's the thing,
I don't actually like you.

434
00:27:04,081 --> 00:27:06,500
I just had to make it look
like I liked you

435
00:27:06,583 --> 00:27:08,919
so someone else wouldn't think
I liked them.

436
00:27:09,002 --> 00:27:11,505
Oh, okay. Okay, who?

437
00:27:11,588 --> 00:27:12,631
- What?
- Who?

438
00:27:12,714 --> 00:27:15,217
You gotta tell me
who this mystery stud is,

439
00:27:15,300 --> 00:27:19,596
otherwise I'm gonna go on believing
you have a secret tattoo with my face on.

440
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:20,681
No.

441
00:27:20,764 --> 00:27:23,684
Should I tell the school
that you wrote me a love letter?

442
00:27:23,767 --> 00:27:25,477
Okay, okay. Fine. Fine. Um...

443
00:27:26,186 --> 00:27:27,437
It's Josh Sanderson.

444
00:27:27,521 --> 00:27:31,316
Wait, hold on, Sanderson?
Doesn't that guy date your sister?

445
00:27:31,441 --> 00:27:32,276
Yeah...

446
00:27:33,026 --> 00:27:37,072
Well, he dated my sister,
in the past tense.

447
00:27:37,156 --> 00:27:40,742
He also got a letter, so you can see
how awkward and complicated

448
00:27:40,826 --> 00:27:43,954
- that's gonna get if he thinks I like him.
- Hold on. Stop.

449
00:27:44,037 --> 00:27:46,290
I'm not the only guy that got a letter?

450
00:27:47,207 --> 00:27:51,295
Wow, you really think you're special,
then you find out she wrote two guys.

451
00:27:51,378 --> 00:27:54,173
I wrote five,
so don't go feeling too special.

452
00:27:54,256 --> 00:27:56,466
- You wrote five love letters?
- Yeah.

453
00:27:56,550 --> 00:27:58,427
Damn, Covey, you're a player.

454
00:27:58,510 --> 00:28:00,721
Who else did you write letters to?

455
00:28:00,804 --> 00:28:03,599
- If I tell you will you leave me alone?
- Maybe.

456
00:28:04,641 --> 00:28:05,726
Okay, Lucas James.

457
00:28:05,809 --> 00:28:06,977
He's... He's gay.

458
00:28:07,060 --> 00:28:08,812
- You don't know that.
- Everyone knows.

459
00:28:09,897 --> 00:28:11,815
- Who else?
- Um...

460
00:28:11,899 --> 00:28:16,111
Someone from camp and someone
I went to Model UN with in fifth grade.

461
00:28:17,196 --> 00:28:19,031
So, are we good here?

462
00:28:19,114 --> 00:28:21,533
Um... Yeah. No, yeah, we're good.

463
00:28:22,326 --> 00:28:23,493
Okay, great.

464
00:28:23,577 --> 00:28:24,578
Wait, wait, wait.

465
00:28:24,661 --> 00:28:25,662
It's just...

466
00:28:26,038 --> 00:28:29,041
That sparkly bike out front,
is that your ride?

467
00:28:30,459 --> 00:28:31,460
Yeah.

468
00:28:38,050 --> 00:28:39,384
Thanks for driving me.

469
00:28:39,468 --> 00:28:40,552
Yeah, sure.

470
00:28:41,220 --> 00:28:45,307
- Sorry for the whole jumping you thing.
- Coulda been worse, right?

471
00:28:47,309 --> 00:28:49,519
What are you gonna say to Sanderson?

472
00:28:50,020 --> 00:28:53,857
- I guess the truth.
- Yeah, but, you know...

473
00:28:53,941 --> 00:28:56,944
What is the truth?
Do you like him, do you not like him?

474
00:28:57,778 --> 00:28:59,947
It's not your problem, Peter.

475
00:29:11,208 --> 00:29:12,960
Hey, hold on.

476
00:29:15,712 --> 00:29:17,673
What if you didn't tell him?

477
00:29:18,840 --> 00:29:19,716
What?

478
00:29:19,800 --> 00:29:23,428
What if we let people think
we were actually together?

479
00:29:23,512 --> 00:29:24,930
Just for a little while.

480
00:29:25,013 --> 00:29:28,058
And not just Sanderson. I mean everybody.

481
00:29:28,141 --> 00:29:30,185
Why would you want that?

482
00:29:30,269 --> 00:29:33,355
For starters, when Gen heard
you kissed me, she went nuts,

483
00:29:33,438 --> 00:29:37,484
and if she thinks you and I are a thing,
she'll want to get back together.

484
00:29:37,567 --> 00:29:40,028
Oh, so you wanna use me as your pawn?

485
00:29:40,112 --> 00:29:45,409
Ah, well, see... Technically, you used me
as your pawn first when you jumped me.

486
00:29:48,912 --> 00:29:52,499
You don't have to give me an answer now,
just think about it, okay?

487
00:29:52,582 --> 00:29:54,626
Yep. Don't hold your breath.

488
00:30:04,428 --> 00:30:07,472
Yo, Sanderson, yeah?

489
00:30:08,265 --> 00:30:09,683
Taking Lara Jean home?

490
00:30:10,517 --> 00:30:11,518
Looks like it.

491
00:30:17,232 --> 00:30:20,277
Hey, how long you two been hanging out?

492
00:30:21,236 --> 00:30:22,237
Uh...

493
00:30:23,113 --> 00:30:24,114
Not long.

494
00:30:38,086 --> 00:30:39,087
phone beeps

495
00:30:42,257 --> 00:30:44,051
- Josh Will you call me?
- Lara Jean Stop.

496
00:30:44,134 --> 00:30:47,304
There's so much I wanna talk about,
music I wanna share,

497
00:30:47,387 --> 00:30:49,181
tattoos I wanna get with you.

498
00:30:49,264 --> 00:30:51,099
Stop. Josh, this cannot happen.

499
00:30:51,183 --> 00:30:52,726
We'd be so great together.

500
00:30:52,809 --> 00:30:54,519
Oh, my God. Shut it.

501
00:30:59,024 --> 00:31:00,567
It's a cool trick, right?

502
00:31:01,610 --> 00:31:03,320
You wanna see me do it again?

503
00:31:06,823 --> 00:31:07,949
Oh, my God.

504
00:31:16,333 --> 00:31:18,001
Hey, Kavinsky!

505
00:31:25,008 --> 00:31:25,842
What?

506
00:31:26,426 --> 00:31:27,511
Let's do this.

507
00:31:40,649 --> 00:31:41,858
I'm going to trig.

508
00:31:43,652 --> 00:31:45,529
- Have a nice day.
- Yeah.

509
00:31:45,612 --> 00:31:46,696
Carry on.

510
00:31:47,406 --> 00:31:48,448
As you were.

511
00:31:48,532 --> 00:31:51,827
So, first things first,
we need to have a contract

512
00:31:51,910 --> 00:31:54,413
so we're on the same page
about the rules.

513
00:31:54,746 --> 00:31:59,376
You got rules? Come on, you really know
how to zap the fun out of a situation.

514
00:31:59,459 --> 00:32:03,130
It's important to know
where you stand on certain issues.

515
00:32:03,213 --> 00:32:04,214
Okay, like what?

516
00:32:05,006 --> 00:32:07,342
For example,
I don't want you to kiss me anymore.

517
00:32:08,552 --> 00:32:11,012
You crazy? Who's gonna believe
we're in a relationship

518
00:32:11,096 --> 00:32:12,514
if I'm not allowed to kiss you?

519
00:32:12,597 --> 00:32:15,183
You may be the James Dean
of this kind of stuff

520
00:32:15,267 --> 00:32:17,102
but I've never had a boyfriend.

521
00:32:17,602 --> 00:32:20,647
You have the references
of an 80-year-old woman.

522
00:32:21,648 --> 00:32:23,024
What does that matter?

523
00:32:23,108 --> 00:32:26,319
It mattersÂ because
I don't want all my firsts to be fake.

524
00:32:26,403 --> 00:32:30,073
If I'm making out with someone,
I'm gonna do it for real.

525
00:32:30,157 --> 00:32:31,741
But you kissed me first.

526
00:32:34,453 --> 00:32:35,871
This is non-negotiable.

527
00:32:37,873 --> 00:32:38,874
Fine.

528
00:32:41,334 --> 00:32:45,589
We need to figure something out
because people are gonna get suspicious

529
00:32:45,672 --> 00:32:47,716
if I'm not allowed to touch you.

530
00:32:47,799 --> 00:32:53,096
Okay, you have a point. How about this?
You can put your hand in my back pocket.

531
00:32:53,180 --> 00:32:56,600
Hand in your back pocket?
What the hell is that?

532
00:32:56,975 --> 00:32:58,059
Sixteen Candles?

533
00:32:58,977 --> 00:33:00,479
It's the opening image.

534
00:33:01,646 --> 00:33:02,939
It's a couples thing.

535
00:33:03,023 --> 00:33:05,358
Yeah, maybe in the '70s.

536
00:33:05,442 --> 00:33:07,444
Sixteen Candle s was the '80s.
John Hughes?

537
00:33:08,528 --> 00:33:09,529
- Nothing?
- Mm.

538
00:33:09,613 --> 00:33:10,864
Okay...

539
00:33:11,114 --> 00:33:12,115
Two more rules.

540
00:33:12,199 --> 00:33:15,452
You have to watch Sixteen Candles with me
because it's a classic,

541
00:33:15,535 --> 00:33:19,539
and we can never tell anyone
this relationship is fake,

542
00:33:19,623 --> 00:33:22,167
because it would be too humiliating
for both of us.

543
00:33:22,250 --> 00:33:24,377
Duh, first rule ofÂ Fight Club.

544
00:33:24,461 --> 00:33:25,295
What?

545
00:33:25,378 --> 00:33:28,548
Are you serious?
You've never seen Fight Club?

546
00:33:29,216 --> 00:33:32,219
Oh, my God!
Okay, write it down. Double feature.

547
00:33:32,302 --> 00:33:36,223
After we watch the Candles movie,
we are watching Fight Club.

548
00:33:36,306 --> 00:33:37,432
Fight Club...

549
00:33:38,141 --> 00:33:39,851
Sixteen Candles...

550
00:33:40,727 --> 00:33:41,895
No snitching.

551
00:33:43,730 --> 00:33:44,856
Anything else?

552
00:33:49,444 --> 00:33:50,737
I could...

553
00:33:51,363 --> 00:33:52,822
I could write you notes,

554
00:33:53,865 --> 00:33:54,950
every day.

555
00:33:57,244 --> 00:33:58,245
You'd do that?

556
00:33:58,328 --> 00:33:59,329
Sure.

557
00:34:01,206 --> 00:34:04,876
Gen was always on me
to write her them. I never did,

558
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:07,003
so if I start sending them to you,

559
00:34:07,504 --> 00:34:09,464
she'll be pissed, it'll be good.

560
00:34:11,341 --> 00:34:12,801
How romantic.

561
00:34:12,884 --> 00:34:16,846
Also, you have to come with me
to my lacrosse games and parties.

562
00:34:16,930 --> 00:34:19,975
You have to pick up my sister and I
and drive us to school.

563
00:34:20,058 --> 00:34:21,059
Okay.

564
00:34:23,311 --> 00:34:25,438
But you're coming on the ski trip.

565
00:34:27,691 --> 00:34:30,402
Whoa...
The Adler High ski trip was infamous

566
00:34:30,485 --> 00:34:34,281
for being the location where
more students lost their virginity

567
00:34:34,364 --> 00:34:36,491
than Senior Week and Prom combined.

568
00:34:37,284 --> 00:34:38,410
I have never been.

569
00:34:39,244 --> 00:34:40,287
Obviously.

570
00:34:40,370 --> 00:34:41,371
Um...

571
00:34:42,038 --> 00:34:46,167
That's three months away. Do you think
we're still gonna be doing this?

572
00:34:46,793 --> 00:34:48,837
Let's call it a contingency.

573
00:34:49,421 --> 00:34:53,300
No one in their right mind is gonna let
their boyfriend go without them,

574
00:34:53,383 --> 00:34:56,928
so if we are still doing this
by the time it comes around,

575
00:34:58,138 --> 00:34:59,264
you have to go with me.

576
00:35:00,140 --> 00:35:03,351
I'm certainÂ that by the time
the ski trip comes around,

577
00:35:03,435 --> 00:35:08,023
Peter and I will be ancient history,
and that is the only reason I say...

578
00:35:08,106 --> 00:35:09,774
Okay. Deal.

579
00:35:25,957 --> 00:35:28,251
Come on, Kitty. We're gonna be late.

580
00:35:28,335 --> 00:35:32,088
I hate taking the bus.
Can you please man up and start driving?

581
00:35:32,172 --> 00:35:33,298
Actually...

582
00:35:33,381 --> 00:35:34,466
car horn honks

583
00:35:38,970 --> 00:35:41,056
Hey. Y'all ready?

584
00:35:41,598 --> 00:35:43,141
Oh, hell, yes!

585
00:35:48,104 --> 00:35:49,856
Hey, little LJ, what is that?

586
00:35:50,231 --> 00:35:51,816
A Korean yogurt smoothie.

587
00:35:51,900 --> 00:35:55,195
And my name, thanks for asking,
is Katherine Song Covey.

588
00:35:55,278 --> 00:35:58,365
Kitty to my friends.
You can call me Katherine.

589
00:35:58,448 --> 00:36:00,700
Yes, ma'am. She's feisty!

590
00:36:01,534 --> 00:36:03,244
Kitty, put on your seat belt.

591
00:36:04,621 --> 00:36:07,165
So how exactly
do you know my sister again?

592
00:36:08,583 --> 00:36:10,251
I guess I'm her boyfriend.

593
00:36:11,878 --> 00:36:13,171
Can I have some of that?

594
00:36:13,880 --> 00:36:14,881
Sure.

595
00:36:18,927 --> 00:36:21,721
Oh, wow. That is really good.

596
00:36:21,805 --> 00:36:23,765
Hey, what do I have to do

597
00:36:23,848 --> 00:36:26,309
to get you to bring me
one of these tomorrow?

598
00:36:26,393 --> 00:36:27,811
You're driving us again?

599
00:36:27,894 --> 00:36:28,937
Yeah, of course.

600
00:36:29,020 --> 00:36:30,730
Okay, you can call me Kitty!

601
00:36:32,482 --> 00:36:33,400
Progress!

602
00:36:43,535 --> 00:36:48,206
I was used to being invisible,
but now, people were looking at me,

603
00:36:48,832 --> 00:36:50,041
talking about me.

604
00:36:57,090 --> 00:36:58,216
What are you doing?

605
00:36:58,299 --> 00:36:59,300
This is for you.

606
00:37:05,849 --> 00:37:07,016
Good job.

607
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:10,228
I'll see you in a bit, okay?

608
00:37:14,524 --> 00:37:16,568
It's weird and somewhat off-putting

609
00:37:16,651 --> 00:37:19,863
to be congratulated on doing nothing more
than accepting a note

610
00:37:19,946 --> 00:37:23,158
and having an ass pocket
for someone to stick their hand into,

611
00:37:23,241 --> 00:37:25,618
but I guess
that's where my life has taken me.

612
00:37:29,372 --> 00:37:31,416
The Kavinsky thing is insane!

613
00:37:31,499 --> 00:37:35,503
Who knew you had a secret boner
for the king of the cafeteria crowd?

614
00:37:36,087 --> 00:37:38,465
I know, I'm just as shocked as you are.

615
00:37:38,548 --> 00:37:39,549
Did Margot freak?

616
00:37:40,133 --> 00:37:42,969
Actually, you know,
I've been avoiding her calls

617
00:37:43,052 --> 00:37:45,555
so she doesn't know yet.

618
00:37:47,348 --> 00:37:49,476
Hi, Margot. How's college?

619
00:37:49,934 --> 00:37:52,896
So listen, did I mention
I have a fake boyfriend?

620
00:37:54,230 --> 00:37:56,608
No? Yeah, it's Peter Kavinsky.

621
00:37:57,025 --> 00:37:58,234
How did it start?

622
00:37:58,318 --> 00:38:03,490
See, that's a funny story,
because it definitely was not because

623
00:38:03,573 --> 00:38:08,077
I was trying to convince your ex-boyfriend
that I wasn't in love with him,

624
00:38:08,161 --> 00:38:09,287
that's for sure.

625
00:38:09,370 --> 00:38:11,122
Oh, shit...

626
00:38:12,332 --> 00:38:14,626
Skype ringtone beeps

627
00:38:15,251 --> 00:38:16,169
Hi!

628
00:38:16,252 --> 00:38:21,341
Hi, finally. I feel like we haven't talked
in forever, so tell me everything.

629
00:38:21,633 --> 00:38:22,675
Well...

630
00:38:23,051 --> 00:38:26,846
I'm just making cupcakes tonight
for Kitty's bake sale.

631
00:38:26,930 --> 00:38:30,850
Cupcakes? No.
It's so much easier to do brownies.

632
00:38:30,934 --> 00:38:34,187
Well, I bought all the ingredients
for cupcakes,

633
00:38:34,270 --> 00:38:36,105
and you're not really here, so...

634
00:38:36,356 --> 00:38:39,359
Okay, fine, do cupcakes.
I'm sure they'll be great.

635
00:38:40,443 --> 00:38:43,321
So have you seen Josh at all lately?

636
00:38:43,696 --> 00:38:46,074
What? No. Why would I be seeing Josh?

637
00:38:46,533 --> 00:38:50,954
I don't know, 'cause he's our neighbor?
Is everything okay with you?

638
00:38:51,538 --> 00:38:54,249
No, you know... No, you know, sorry.

639
00:38:54,332 --> 00:38:57,043
I am just so excited
to get to these cupcakes.

640
00:38:57,126 --> 00:39:00,922
I think I'm gonna go and do that,
but it was so good to see you.

641
00:39:01,005 --> 00:39:02,382
- Wait, Lara Jean!
- Bye!

642
00:39:09,347 --> 00:39:10,598
knock at door

643
00:39:16,312 --> 00:39:17,313
Hey.

644
00:39:17,689 --> 00:39:20,817
Who are you supposed to be,
the Pillsbury Doughboy?

645
00:39:20,900 --> 00:39:23,653
No, I'm making cupcakes
for Kitty's bake sale.

646
00:39:24,779 --> 00:39:25,780
Can I come in?

647
00:39:26,823 --> 00:39:27,824
- Sure.
- Cool.

648
00:39:28,324 --> 00:39:33,413
You know it's easier if you make something
you can cut into squares like brownies?

649
00:39:33,496 --> 00:39:35,707
My mom used to do it for my brother.

650
00:39:37,834 --> 00:39:40,211
Peter Kavinsky, what are you doing here?

651
00:39:40,628 --> 00:39:43,798
Did you not read my note?
I'm taking you to Greg's party.

652
00:39:43,882 --> 00:39:46,676
- Oh, I'm not going to that.
- Yeah, you are.

653
00:39:46,759 --> 00:39:50,305
One, Gen is gonna be there,
and two, parties are in the contract.

654
00:39:50,388 --> 00:39:52,265
Sorry, Peter, I can't.

655
00:39:52,348 --> 00:39:53,349
A deal's a deal.

656
00:39:53,433 --> 00:39:57,103
You can't what? Is that Peter Kavinsky?

657
00:39:58,146 --> 00:40:00,732
Little Peter Kavinsky,
you're as tall as me now.

658
00:40:00,815 --> 00:40:03,818
- Good to see you again, Dr. Covey.
- You can call me Dan.

659
00:40:03,943 --> 00:40:07,155
I'm here to pick up Lara Jean,
take her to a friend's party.

660
00:40:07,238 --> 00:40:10,450
The parents will be home,
and I will have her home early.

661
00:40:10,533 --> 00:40:11,826
Is it alright if we go?

662
00:40:11,910 --> 00:40:12,911
- Yes.
- No!

663
00:40:14,245 --> 00:40:16,289
I can't go.
I have to finish these cupcakes.

664
00:40:16,372 --> 00:40:19,167
I think Kitty
and I can handle some cupcakes.

665
00:40:19,250 --> 00:40:22,295
Why don't you go have fun
with your friend Peter Kavinsky?

666
00:40:22,378 --> 00:40:25,089
Get dressed, get changed,
you look like a crazy lady.

667
00:40:25,173 --> 00:40:26,299
Dad, don't, please.

668
00:40:29,344 --> 00:40:31,429
No drinking. No drugs.

669
00:40:31,512 --> 00:40:33,431
- No hands.
- You got it.

670
00:40:39,103 --> 00:40:40,605
I don't know, Peter. I...

671
00:40:40,688 --> 00:40:43,316
No, we're going. It's in the contract.

672
00:40:53,201 --> 00:40:55,620
- What are you doing? Give me this.
- No.

673
00:40:56,329 --> 00:40:57,914
What? No. Give that back.

674
00:40:57,997 --> 00:41:00,249
I'm keeping it. I like your hair down.

675
00:41:01,167 --> 00:41:02,168
You look pretty.

676
00:41:03,336 --> 00:41:04,712
I'll prove it to you.

677
00:41:06,089 --> 00:41:07,006
camera shutter snaps

678
00:41:08,883 --> 00:41:09,884
- See?
- Fine.

679
00:41:09,968 --> 00:41:12,929
But you can't lose it.
That's my favorite scrunchie.

680
00:41:13,221 --> 00:41:15,014
Deal. Give me your phone.

681
00:41:15,098 --> 00:41:16,849
- Why?
- Would you trust me?

682
00:41:23,773 --> 00:41:24,649
camera shutter snaps

683
00:41:24,732 --> 00:41:27,986
Alright, you need to make this
your new background.

684
00:41:28,069 --> 00:41:31,906
- What's your new background?
- Come on. You know I already got it.

685
00:41:35,994 --> 00:41:36,995
Leggo.

686
00:41:37,912 --> 00:41:40,248
- Wait, maybe I should just...
- Come on!

687
00:41:43,418 --> 00:41:44,252
Pete!

688
00:41:44,335 --> 00:41:45,420
I never miss.

689
00:41:46,254 --> 00:41:49,590
I told you I never miss, man.
Welcome to my party.

690
00:41:49,674 --> 00:41:51,676
It's gorgeous. This your new pad?

691
00:41:51,759 --> 00:41:54,095
It's my parents' pad,
but I'll take credit.

692
00:41:54,178 --> 00:41:58,307
- I'm gonna get you a drink. You want some?
- Cool, yeah. I got you.

693
00:41:58,391 --> 00:41:59,642
Hey, Lara Jean.

694
00:42:00,727 --> 00:42:01,728
Come sit with us.

695
00:42:01,811 --> 00:42:02,812
Sit with them.

696
00:42:03,146 --> 00:42:04,105
Sit with them.

697
00:42:04,772 --> 00:42:05,940
Nice talk.

698
00:42:10,445 --> 00:42:12,071
So... Dish.

699
00:42:12,905 --> 00:42:14,907
What's up with you and Kavinsky?

700
00:42:15,074 --> 00:42:17,452
Oh, no. Don't push her. She's shy!

701
00:42:17,535 --> 00:42:18,661
girl chuckles

702
00:42:18,745 --> 00:42:22,457
- What do you wanna know?
- Everything. When? How?

703
00:42:23,041 --> 00:42:24,500
How far? H on B?

704
00:42:24,584 --> 00:42:26,169
H on C?

705
00:42:27,336 --> 00:42:29,714
H up and down on P? T on C?

706
00:42:29,839 --> 00:42:32,175
Sorry, what are we talking about again?

707
00:42:32,258 --> 00:42:35,845
You know, forget it.
Clearly they haven't done anything.

708
00:42:35,928 --> 00:42:37,055
How would you know?

709
00:42:37,638 --> 00:42:39,098
Because I know Peter,

710
00:42:40,516 --> 00:42:41,934
and I know Lara Jean.

711
00:42:44,270 --> 00:42:45,313
I'm gonna get a refill.

712
00:42:46,355 --> 00:42:48,816
Um... can I get you anything?

713
00:42:49,150 --> 00:42:51,319
Like a juice box or chocolate milk.

714
00:42:51,402 --> 00:42:55,907
Peter's going to get me a drink,
but thank you so much for offering.

715
00:42:55,990 --> 00:42:57,867
Ooh. What's up, babe?

716
00:42:57,950 --> 00:42:59,035
Hi.

717
00:43:05,249 --> 00:43:06,918
Why is beer so vinegary?

718
00:43:07,001 --> 00:43:08,044
Oh... It's not.

719
00:43:08,294 --> 00:43:10,838
Kombucha is, though.
I'm driving, remember?

720
00:43:11,547 --> 00:43:12,799
You drink kombucha?

721
00:43:14,092 --> 00:43:15,885
Yeah, it's good for your digestion.

722
00:43:18,930 --> 00:43:21,099
Here. Take a selfie.

723
00:43:23,434 --> 00:43:24,727
Alright. You do it.

724
00:43:31,234 --> 00:43:32,652
Hey. Boo!

725
00:43:33,319 --> 00:43:34,320
Hey.

726
00:43:34,403 --> 00:43:36,447
Hey. I didn't know you came.

727
00:43:36,572 --> 00:43:38,157
Well, here I am.

728
00:43:38,741 --> 00:43:42,203
So you're with Kavinsky, huh?
Guess those letters worked.

729
00:43:42,286 --> 00:43:46,791
- Yeah, but you gotta keep it a secret.
- Your filthy secret's safe with me.

730
00:43:47,333 --> 00:43:48,376
What's that?

731
00:43:49,502 --> 00:43:51,212
Whoa. Hey, occupied.

732
00:43:55,633 --> 00:43:57,426
Lara Jean Covey, really?

733
00:43:59,345 --> 00:44:00,346
What do you care?

734
00:44:03,850 --> 00:44:07,687
Aw, this is so cute! Is this hers?

735
00:44:07,770 --> 00:44:08,855
Come on.

736
00:44:14,443 --> 00:44:15,444
How do I look?

737
00:44:17,029 --> 00:44:19,448
You look good, Gen. You always look good.

738
00:44:20,241 --> 00:44:21,576
Come on, give it back.

739
00:44:22,118 --> 00:44:24,579
No, I'm going to keep it for a while, 'k?

740
00:44:25,413 --> 00:44:27,707
Don't worry, I won't tell.

741
00:44:28,708 --> 00:44:29,709
Go on, try it.

742
00:44:29,792 --> 00:44:32,170
Not gonna lie to you, that sounds nasty.

743
00:44:33,796 --> 00:44:34,797
Bottoms up.

744
00:44:35,840 --> 00:44:39,260
Hey. Do you want to get out of here,
go grab some food?

745
00:44:40,887 --> 00:44:42,930
- Oh no, go ahead. Go, go.
- Okay.

746
00:44:43,014 --> 00:44:44,348
- See you later.
- Bye.

747
00:44:45,600 --> 00:44:46,601
See ya.

748
00:44:48,394 --> 00:44:50,813
You did so good tonight, Gen was pissed.

749
00:44:50,897 --> 00:44:54,442
Yeah, I just hope she doesn't
put glass in my smoothie on Monday.

750
00:44:55,985 --> 00:44:59,530
- I love how you're not afraid of her.
- No, no. I'm terrified of her.

751
00:44:59,655 --> 00:45:02,033
But you don't let her steamroll over you.

752
00:45:02,116 --> 00:45:05,077
Like that day she was being a bitch
about your shoes.

753
00:45:05,161 --> 00:45:07,705
- You remember that?
- Yeah, of course.

754
00:45:08,414 --> 00:45:13,252
I mean, I couldn't say anything
because we were together and everything

755
00:45:13,336 --> 00:45:17,256
but those shoes weren't just cool,
I thought they were kinda hot.

756
00:45:17,840 --> 00:45:21,344
Gen's gorgeous,
but you have way better style.

757
00:45:22,720 --> 00:45:23,721
Thank you.

758
00:45:24,222 --> 00:45:25,765
You need anything else?

759
00:45:25,848 --> 00:45:27,725
Um, no. I think we're good.

760
00:45:27,808 --> 00:45:28,726
Okay.

761
00:45:28,809 --> 00:45:29,810
phone buzzes

762
00:45:36,025 --> 00:45:39,904
- She makes me so angry sometimes.
- We're still talking about her?

763
00:45:40,029 --> 00:45:44,742
Tonight, she barely talks to me, we leave,
and I have a thousand texts from her.

764
00:45:44,825 --> 00:45:47,453
- Okay, have you been responding?
- No, I'm...

765
00:45:47,620 --> 00:45:52,124
- I'll just call her when I get home.
- You guys still talk on the phone then?

766
00:45:52,708 --> 00:45:55,962
I mean, not as much as we used to,
but yeah, sometimes.

767
00:45:58,965 --> 00:46:00,132
- What?
- Hmm?

768
00:46:00,216 --> 00:46:01,634
You do this thing,

769
00:46:01,717 --> 00:46:04,971
you have this whole judgy face scenario
going on.

770
00:46:05,054 --> 00:46:06,931
I guess I just think it's really weird

771
00:46:07,014 --> 00:46:09,350
you still talk to your ex-girlfriend
on the phone.

772
00:46:09,725 --> 00:46:10,935
It's not healthy.

773
00:46:11,018 --> 00:46:14,480
Sorry, you're the expert?
You've n e ver even had a boyfriend.

774
00:46:14,563 --> 00:46:18,526
You've only had one girlfriend,
and you're obsessed with her.

775
00:46:18,651 --> 00:46:21,445
That doesn't necessarily
make you The Bachelor.

776
00:46:21,529 --> 00:46:22,613
One, I am not...

777
00:46:23,197 --> 00:46:24,282
obsessed with her.

778
00:46:24,365 --> 00:46:30,079
Okay. So then, prove it.
Don't call her tonight.

779
00:46:30,162 --> 00:46:33,791
For some who's quiet all the time,
you have a lot of opinions.

780
00:46:33,874 --> 00:46:37,253
That's just because no one's been
honest with you before.

781
00:46:39,046 --> 00:46:39,922
Okay, fine.

782
00:46:41,215 --> 00:46:45,344
Be honest with me, then.
Why haven't you ever had a boyfriend?

783
00:46:47,138 --> 00:46:50,182
I don't know.
I guess no one's ever liked me like that.

784
00:46:50,266 --> 00:46:52,393
Lies. I know that those are lies,

785
00:46:52,476 --> 00:46:56,731
because I know for a fact Carlos Myers
asked you to Spring Formal last year

786
00:46:56,814 --> 00:46:57,815
and you said no.

787
00:46:57,898 --> 00:47:01,277
- Are you keeping tabs on me?
- Come on, Covey, talk to me.

788
00:47:01,360 --> 00:47:03,738
What happened to no secrets?Â Fight Club.

789
00:47:04,322 --> 00:47:05,156
Remember?

790
00:47:07,575 --> 00:47:10,369
Okay. Um... So love and dating?

791
00:47:11,454 --> 00:47:14,498
I love to read about it,

792
00:47:14,582 --> 00:47:17,626
and it's fun to write about

793
00:47:17,710 --> 00:47:20,004
and to think about in my head, but...

794
00:47:22,048 --> 00:47:23,215
when it's real...

795
00:47:25,885 --> 00:47:27,261
What, it's scary?

796
00:47:29,138 --> 00:47:30,139
Yeah.

797
00:47:31,682 --> 00:47:33,976
Why? Why is that scary?

798
00:47:37,021 --> 00:47:39,899
'Cause the more people
that you let into your life,

799
00:47:39,982 --> 00:47:42,443
the more that can just walk right out.

800
00:47:46,655 --> 00:47:48,824
Just like... Like your mom, right?

801
00:47:55,331 --> 00:47:57,208
Uh, did you know that...

802
00:47:58,918 --> 00:48:00,419
my dad left us?

803
00:48:00,503 --> 00:48:02,671
Yeah. That was a while ago, right?

804
00:48:04,715 --> 00:48:05,800
Two summers ago.

805
00:48:07,134 --> 00:48:10,513
He's got a new wife and kid now.

806
00:48:11,639 --> 00:48:12,681
I'm so sorry.

807
00:48:12,765 --> 00:48:15,935
No, it's fine. It's...
I don't usually talk about it.

808
00:48:16,018 --> 00:48:19,772
I just felt like maybe you'd understand
'cause of your mom.

809
00:48:19,855 --> 00:48:22,525
Not that
it is anywhere near the same thing.

810
00:48:22,608 --> 00:48:25,820
No, it's totally fine.
I completely understand.

811
00:48:27,947 --> 00:48:30,324
Yeah, it's... It's hard, huh?

812
00:48:32,243 --> 00:48:33,244
It's whatever.

813
00:48:34,328 --> 00:48:37,748
We don't have to talk about it,
but it's not whatever.

814
00:48:40,418 --> 00:48:45,047
I think it's funny,
you say you're scared of commitment

815
00:48:45,131 --> 00:48:46,465
and relationships,

816
00:48:47,383 --> 00:48:50,886
but you don't seem to be afraid
to be with me.

817
00:48:52,513 --> 00:48:55,266
- Well, there's there's no reason to be.
- Yeah?

818
00:48:56,809 --> 00:48:57,810
Why's that?

819
00:48:59,937 --> 00:49:01,480
'Cause we're just pretending.

820
00:49:03,983 --> 00:49:07,319
Right, of course, Lara Jean Covey,

821
00:49:07,403 --> 00:49:11,532
ladies and gentlemen, you can count on her
to be honest, always.

822
00:49:12,533 --> 00:49:13,534
Wait, Peter?

823
00:49:13,826 --> 00:49:16,287
- Are we cool?
- Yeah, we're fine, Covey.

824
00:49:16,745 --> 00:49:19,665
Thank you for coming to the party tonight.

825
00:50:10,382 --> 00:50:11,550
phone beeps

826
00:50:19,517 --> 00:50:22,436
Fake dating Peter was getting easier
and easier.

827
00:50:22,520 --> 00:50:24,855
I always ate with him in the cafeteria

828
00:50:24,939 --> 00:50:27,691
and was even becoming friends
with some of his friends.

829
00:50:28,901 --> 00:50:30,152
Don't touch my fries.

830
00:50:30,236 --> 00:50:33,364
Listen, Lara Jean,
I was thinking about your name,

831
00:50:33,447 --> 00:50:36,575
Lara Jean, put them together,
you get Largie! Largie.

832
00:50:36,659 --> 00:50:38,911
They were nothing like my old friends.

833
00:50:38,994 --> 00:50:41,914
- Are you on something?
- I'm on to a new nickname for you.

834
00:50:41,997 --> 00:50:46,627
Largie, it's funny because she's so small!

835
00:50:46,710 --> 00:50:49,296
But it was fun to be part of a group.

836
00:50:49,380 --> 00:50:52,883
Of course, there were still moments
I wanted to disappear.

837
00:50:54,426 --> 00:50:55,427
doorbell rings

838
00:50:56,887 --> 00:50:57,846
Hey.

839
00:50:57,930 --> 00:50:59,098
Can we talk now?

840
00:51:00,349 --> 00:51:02,434
I can't believe you're dating Kavinsky.

841
00:51:03,018 --> 00:51:04,019
Why?

842
00:51:04,728 --> 00:51:07,565
Is it so unbelievable
that someone could like me?

843
00:51:07,648 --> 00:51:10,526
No, it's unbelievable that...

844
00:51:11,026 --> 00:51:15,364
you're like the sweet, innocent girl,
and he's a complete dick.

845
00:51:15,614 --> 00:51:16,615
I don't get it.

846
00:51:16,699 --> 00:51:21,328
You know you make me sound really boring,
right, Josh? I'm not that innocent.

847
00:51:22,288 --> 00:51:23,289
Okay.

848
00:51:24,540 --> 00:51:25,541
Okay!

849
00:51:26,542 --> 00:51:30,462
Well, great. If that was the reason
you came over to talk to me...

850
00:51:30,546 --> 00:51:32,423
No, it's... I... Wait.

851
00:51:33,757 --> 00:51:34,633
Look...

852
00:51:38,512 --> 00:51:40,889
Did you mean what you wrote in the letter?

853
00:51:42,641 --> 00:51:45,811
I don't know. Okay?
It was a long time ago.

854
00:51:45,894 --> 00:51:47,646
Well, not for me, alright?

855
00:51:47,730 --> 00:51:52,109
This is all new, so like, I'm...
I'm trying to understand here.

856
00:51:52,192 --> 00:51:55,863
There's nothing to understand.
You should have never seen it.

857
00:51:55,946 --> 00:51:57,197
I did see it!

858
00:51:57,823 --> 00:52:00,659
Alright? So... What am I supposed to do?

859
00:52:01,410 --> 00:52:04,121
- Not tell Margot?
- Margot's not even talking to me.

860
00:52:04,204 --> 00:52:06,915
Alright?
You don't have to worry about that.

861
00:52:10,753 --> 00:52:12,630
I'm sorry. Thanks, I...

862
00:52:13,839 --> 00:52:14,840
That's it?

863
00:52:15,090 --> 00:52:18,927
Margot dumps me, you're dating Kavinsky,
and we can't even be friends?

864
00:52:19,011 --> 00:52:21,430
I don't know
how to be friends with you like this.

865
00:52:21,513 --> 00:52:24,516
We can't go back to how it was
before you and Margot were dating.

866
00:52:24,600 --> 00:52:28,103
We definitely can't go back to how it was
when you were dating.

867
00:52:28,187 --> 00:52:32,149
- If I'd known I was gonna lose both of...
- Stop. Don't finish that sentence.

868
00:52:33,108 --> 00:52:34,276
I just...

869
00:52:37,112 --> 00:52:40,282
- You can't just ignore me.
- No, we can't talk. Sorry.

870
00:52:52,419 --> 00:52:53,545
Go away!

871
00:52:54,713 --> 00:52:58,384
I'm sorry, isn't this character,
Long Dong Duck...

872
00:52:58,884 --> 00:53:00,094
like, kinda racist?

873
00:53:00,177 --> 00:53:02,137
Not "kind of." Extremely racist.

874
00:53:02,680 --> 00:53:04,390
So why do you like this movie?

875
00:53:04,640 --> 00:53:09,395
Why are even asking that question?
Hello, Jake Ryan!

876
00:53:11,939 --> 00:53:14,066
I am way better looking than that guy.

877
00:53:14,316 --> 00:53:15,442
You wish!

878
00:53:15,526 --> 00:53:18,028
Oh, yeah? Incoming!

879
00:53:20,280 --> 00:53:21,448
Whoa. Okay.

880
00:53:21,532 --> 00:53:24,493
I just hoped
that Kitty wasn't getting too attached.

881
00:53:24,702 --> 00:53:25,703
In fact,

882
00:53:26,495 --> 00:53:29,540
I wish we could've kept our families
out of it altogether.

883
00:53:30,040 --> 00:53:32,209
We're so happy to finally meet you.

884
00:53:33,460 --> 00:53:35,879
Peter tells me that you have two sisters.

885
00:53:35,963 --> 00:53:41,260
Yes, I have an older sister who just left
for college, and I have a younger sister,

886
00:53:41,343 --> 00:53:42,344
who's Owen's age.

887
00:53:42,428 --> 00:53:45,222
Aw. Well, your mom must love having girls.

888
00:53:45,806 --> 00:53:48,308
And me? I'm stuck with these two heathens.

889
00:53:48,684 --> 00:53:49,685
Mom, I told you.

890
00:53:49,768 --> 00:53:52,104
Lara Jean's mother passed away
when she was little.

891
00:53:55,023 --> 00:53:57,609
I am so sorry, Lara Jean, I...

892
00:53:59,319 --> 00:54:01,822
Actually, she... she did love having girls.

893
00:54:02,990 --> 00:54:05,451
Although,
Kitty is definitely still a heathen.

894
00:54:10,873 --> 00:54:13,250
So, Owen's a pretty shy kid, huh?

895
00:54:13,500 --> 00:54:14,501
Yeah.

896
00:54:15,127 --> 00:54:17,296
I think Kitty could help with that.

897
00:54:17,504 --> 00:54:18,589
- Yeah?
- Mm-hmm.

898
00:54:19,006 --> 00:54:19,840
Okay.

899
00:54:19,923 --> 00:54:22,217
I think they would be good friends.

900
00:54:22,968 --> 00:54:24,928
Probably. Yeah.

901
00:54:27,514 --> 00:54:30,934
Hey, I'm really sorry
about what my mom said to you.

902
00:54:31,643 --> 00:54:32,895
No, it's okay.

903
00:54:33,729 --> 00:54:38,150
Honestly, you know, it's nice
talking about her like it's normal.

904
00:54:39,026 --> 00:54:41,779
Like it's not some tragedy.

905
00:54:49,828 --> 00:54:51,914
Is it weird not having your dad around?

906
00:54:55,334 --> 00:54:57,544
It's not as weird as it used to be.

907
00:54:59,713 --> 00:55:04,343
Sometimes I walk around the house
and see he's not in any photos anymore,

908
00:55:06,345 --> 00:55:07,721
and I really miss him.

909
00:55:09,932 --> 00:55:12,935
But then I think about everything
he's doing with his new family

910
00:55:13,018 --> 00:55:16,814
that he used to do with us,
and I get so mad I'm glad he's gone.

911
00:55:17,272 --> 00:55:18,565
You don't mean that.

912
00:55:20,442 --> 00:55:23,028
You can be mad at someone
and still miss them.

913
00:55:28,033 --> 00:55:30,244
I bet you really miss your mom, huh?

914
00:55:32,830 --> 00:55:33,831
Yeah.

915
00:55:34,248 --> 00:55:35,249
Every day.

916
00:55:37,334 --> 00:55:38,585
But you know, it's...

917
00:55:39,920 --> 00:55:42,256
It's been so long now that, like...

918
00:55:42,339 --> 00:55:45,050
Okay, it's like this,
I'll be doing my homework,

919
00:55:45,133 --> 00:55:48,720
or I will be washing dishes or something,

920
00:55:48,804 --> 00:55:51,181
and I'm thinking about my family,

921
00:55:51,640 --> 00:55:56,103
and I forget there was a time where
it wasn't just my dad and my sisters.

922
00:55:57,521 --> 00:56:00,983
And it only happens
for like a quarter of a second, but...

923
00:56:01,817 --> 00:56:04,111
I feel really, really guilty about it.

924
00:56:07,155 --> 00:56:09,283
I've never told anyone that before.

925
00:56:10,617 --> 00:56:11,660
I mean, I get it.

926
00:56:12,494 --> 00:56:13,745
It makes sense to me.

927
00:56:15,414 --> 00:56:18,375
I don't actually hate my dad,
I didn't mean it like that.

928
00:56:20,002 --> 00:56:21,545
At least he's not, you know...

929
00:56:24,006 --> 00:56:25,007
Dead.

930
00:56:26,925 --> 00:56:27,926
Sorry.

931
00:56:29,469 --> 00:56:30,637
It's okay.

932
00:56:33,515 --> 00:56:37,352
It's actually really nice having someone
to talk to about this stuff.

933
00:56:38,562 --> 00:56:39,938
You're a good listener.

934
00:56:40,522 --> 00:56:41,523
Yeah?

935
00:56:42,441 --> 00:56:43,442
Why, thank you.

936
00:56:45,444 --> 00:56:46,486
You are, too.

937
00:56:48,155 --> 00:56:49,156
Thanks.

938
00:56:49,948 --> 00:56:50,949
You're welcome.

939
00:56:52,326 --> 00:56:54,036
Being with Peter was so easy

940
00:56:54,119 --> 00:56:56,872
that sometimes
I let myself pretend it wasn't fake.

941
00:56:57,289 --> 00:57:00,918
Remind me again why we have
to eat these subs under the bleachers?

942
00:57:01,001 --> 00:57:04,630
Dude, we can't have
these contraband cups out in the open!

943
00:57:04,713 --> 00:57:08,967
Don't want the powers-that-be catching on
to my lunchtime truancy vibes.

944
00:57:09,051 --> 00:57:11,261
P.S. that sub is tight, right?

945
00:57:11,345 --> 00:57:15,307
I don't know, Peter. It's like
you don't have time for me anymore.

946
00:57:15,891 --> 00:57:17,809
All you do is hang out with her.

947
00:57:17,893 --> 00:57:21,521
Am I supposed to wait
while you're off with this college guy?

948
00:57:21,605 --> 00:57:25,943
- We should get out, this sounds private.
- Are you insane? That's your boyfriend!

949
00:57:26,026 --> 00:57:27,819
He's not a good listener.

950
00:57:27,903 --> 00:57:30,572
'Cause he's not at your beck and call
like I am.

951
00:57:30,656 --> 00:57:32,741
Gen, you can't keep doing this to me.

952
00:57:33,951 --> 00:57:37,746
She's not coming on the ski trip, is she?
That's our thing.

953
00:57:37,913 --> 00:57:40,415
What does it matter? You have a boyfriend.

954
00:57:41,750 --> 00:57:42,960
Yeah, but...

955
00:57:43,835 --> 00:57:44,962
maybe by then...

956
00:57:45,629 --> 00:57:46,630
I won't.

957
00:57:47,839 --> 00:57:48,840
Dude!

958
00:57:50,133 --> 00:57:51,927
Gen is after your man.

959
00:57:54,346 --> 00:57:58,016
I'm sorry, I know you don't want
to hear about Peter stuff,

960
00:57:58,100 --> 00:58:01,186
but I needed to talk to someone
I thought might understand.

961
00:58:01,269 --> 00:58:03,480
I feel like the more used to him I get,

962
00:58:03,563 --> 00:58:06,650
the more it's gonna hurt when
he inevitably gets back with Gen,

963
00:58:06,733 --> 00:58:10,737
and I'm so mad at myself
because I should've seen this coming.

964
00:58:12,406 --> 00:58:13,490
Nah, I'm good.

965
00:58:15,784 --> 00:58:19,079
I don't know what to tell you.
That sucks. I'm sorry.

966
00:58:19,830 --> 00:58:20,956
Lara Jean!

967
00:58:23,250 --> 00:58:24,251
Want me to wait?

968
00:58:24,918 --> 00:58:25,961
You'd better not.

969
00:58:31,091 --> 00:58:32,300
I'll see you later.

970
00:58:32,384 --> 00:58:34,344
What do you think people are gonna say

971
00:58:34,428 --> 00:58:36,930
when they see my girlfriend
cozying up to Sanderson?

972
00:58:37,014 --> 00:58:42,102
What do you think, when they hear
you're begging to get back with Gen?

973
00:58:42,185 --> 00:58:45,230
- So you're spying on me now?
- Not intentionally.

974
00:58:46,314 --> 00:58:49,276
Okay, so I was talking to Gen. So what?

975
00:58:49,359 --> 00:58:51,862
You don't even post about us
on your Instagram.

976
00:58:51,945 --> 00:58:53,989
'Cause I don't want my sisters to see.

977
00:58:54,322 --> 00:58:56,158
Yeah, like Kitty's gonna care.

978
00:58:56,241 --> 00:58:58,035
I'm talking about Margot.

979
00:58:59,911 --> 00:59:01,496
Look, Peter...

980
00:59:02,622 --> 00:59:06,501
I don't think either one of us thought
this was going to go on for this long,

981
00:59:06,585 --> 00:59:11,298
but Josh and I are cool, Gen's jealous,
I think that we need to call it.

982
00:59:11,381 --> 00:59:14,926
I can't believe you're trying to break up
with me before the ski trip.

983
00:59:15,010 --> 00:59:16,470
That's in the contract.

984
00:59:16,553 --> 00:59:19,848
- Only if we're still together.
- We are still together!

985
00:59:19,931 --> 00:59:22,559
You're trying to pull out
because you're scared.

986
00:59:22,642 --> 00:59:24,603
What do I have to be scared about?

987
00:59:25,937 --> 00:59:27,314
You tell me, Covey.

988
00:59:28,940 --> 00:59:31,985
How do you tell your fake boyfriend
you can't go skiing with him

989
00:59:32,069 --> 00:59:34,321
because you're starting
to have real feelings?

990
00:59:34,780 --> 00:59:35,781
You can't.

991
00:59:36,531 --> 00:59:37,616
So you pivot.

992
00:59:39,117 --> 00:59:40,452
I'll go if Chris goes.

993
00:59:40,869 --> 00:59:44,706
I'm not denying your right
to put food on the table for your family.

994
00:59:44,790 --> 00:59:49,169
I just think it's odd that a man would
want to become a gynecologist.

995
00:59:49,336 --> 00:59:51,838
Like when you were in college,
you thought,

996
00:59:51,922 --> 00:59:56,093
"I'd really love
to look at vaginas all day."

997
00:59:57,552 --> 00:59:59,679
Gonna leave the kitchen now, Christine.

998
01:00:01,348 --> 01:00:03,100
- Hi, guys. Hey.
- Hi, honey.

999
01:00:03,183 --> 01:00:04,392
Hi, Dad.

1000
01:00:05,102 --> 01:00:06,103
So, what's up?

1001
01:00:06,186 --> 01:00:09,397
Why's your boyfriend harassing me
about coming on the ski trip?

1002
01:00:09,481 --> 01:00:11,733
You know I don't do school functions.

1003
01:00:11,817 --> 01:00:15,862
Yes, and that is why I told him
I would only go if you would,

1004
01:00:16,029 --> 01:00:17,614
knowing that you wouldn't.

1005
01:00:18,865 --> 01:00:19,866
Wait...

1006
01:00:20,534 --> 01:00:21,827
You have to go!

1007
01:00:22,327 --> 01:00:25,539
Gen's definitely gonna
make a move on Peter if you stay home.

1008
01:00:25,622 --> 01:00:26,623
So let her.

1009
01:00:26,706 --> 01:00:30,377
I'm sick of having her little snake eyes
on me all the time.

1010
01:00:30,460 --> 01:00:31,670
Dude, no!

1011
01:00:31,753 --> 01:00:34,881
Gen always gets what she wants
and it's bullshit!

1012
01:00:35,715 --> 01:00:36,925
You get Peter.

1013
01:00:37,551 --> 01:00:40,679
I'll make sure of it.
I'm coming on that trip.

1014
01:00:40,762 --> 01:00:43,974
I'm really tired of you using me
to get back at Gen.

1015
01:00:44,057 --> 01:00:45,392
It's not just that.

1016
01:00:46,768 --> 01:00:49,354
Since you've been with Peter,

1017
01:00:49,437 --> 01:00:50,897
well, I don't know, LJ,

1018
01:00:51,731 --> 01:00:53,650
I've never seen you so happy.

1019
01:00:53,942 --> 01:00:55,193
Honey, she's right.

1020
01:00:55,819 --> 01:00:58,029
I'm sorry, I wasn't eavesdropping,

1021
01:00:58,113 --> 01:01:03,785
but I haven't seen you have so much fun
going to parties and making new friends.

1022
01:01:05,245 --> 01:01:07,289
You made your old man very happy.

1023
01:01:12,169 --> 01:01:13,545
That was kind of sweet.

1024
01:01:14,087 --> 01:01:15,088
Yeah.

1025
01:01:19,426 --> 01:01:21,845
Thanks, Dad. See you in a couple of days.

1026
01:01:21,928 --> 01:01:24,055
We need to talk about your sexual health.

1027
01:01:24,723 --> 01:01:26,183
No. No, please, no.

1028
01:01:26,266 --> 01:01:29,227
As your father,
I think you're too young to have sex.

1029
01:01:29,311 --> 01:01:31,771
Did you know
most unwanted teenage pregnancies

1030
01:01:31,855 --> 01:01:34,065
are the result of expecting abstinence?

1031
01:01:34,149 --> 01:01:36,985
I know that you're smart enough
not to do things

1032
01:01:37,068 --> 01:01:39,154
just because a boy may want you to.

1033
01:01:39,237 --> 01:01:40,906
Okay, let's make this end.

1034
01:01:41,072 --> 01:01:43,241
It's your decision. I want you to be safe.

1035
01:01:44,618 --> 01:01:46,286
Why are you giving me these?

1036
01:01:46,369 --> 01:01:47,829
Pulling out's not protection.

1037
01:01:47,913 --> 01:01:49,414
Oh, my God. I'm getting out.

1038
01:01:53,418 --> 01:01:54,920
Don't forget to have fun.

1039
01:01:55,003 --> 01:01:58,840
Yes, well, I have a lot of rubbers
for that, specifically.

1040
01:02:08,141 --> 01:02:10,060
Whoa. Hey. Where are you going?

1041
01:02:10,685 --> 01:02:12,520
I'm gonna go sit with Chris.

1042
01:02:12,646 --> 01:02:14,814
Chris? Come on, she's sleeping.

1043
01:02:15,023 --> 01:02:16,483
I saw her Snapchat.

1044
01:02:16,566 --> 01:02:19,402
She was up all night
at this EDM concert thing.

1045
01:02:20,820 --> 01:02:22,989
That's more reason to sit with her.

1046
01:02:23,281 --> 01:02:26,326
Don't want her to go swallowing her tongue
or anything.

1047
01:02:31,539 --> 01:02:32,749
Is this seat taken?

1048
01:02:34,793 --> 01:02:35,794
Uh...

1049
01:02:36,836 --> 01:02:37,671
No.

1050
01:02:42,842 --> 01:02:44,052
This was a mistake.

1051
01:02:45,428 --> 01:02:49,641
Tell me about it. I can't believe
I let you convince me to go on a trip

1052
01:02:49,724 --> 01:02:52,102
that requires getting up before 7:00.

1053
01:03:10,328 --> 01:03:13,039
Who goes to an EDM concert
on a school night?

1054
01:03:13,123 --> 01:03:14,582
Uh, lots of people do.

1055
01:03:14,666 --> 01:03:18,837
It wasn't necessarily like an EDM concert,
it was more like a rock...

1056
01:03:18,920 --> 01:03:19,921
Oh, okay.

1057
01:03:21,047 --> 01:03:24,801
They said, "Greg, make sure everyone
sleeps in their assigned room."

1058
01:03:24,884 --> 01:03:28,388
And I said, "Overruled,
sleep where you want, sluts."

1059
01:03:30,140 --> 01:03:31,683
They're the chaperones?

1060
01:03:31,766 --> 01:03:33,560
See you on Black Diamond, Peter?

1061
01:03:33,935 --> 01:03:36,354
Last down the slope owes the other
a hot toddy.

1062
01:03:38,815 --> 01:03:40,942
- Go get your man.
- Are you kidding?

1063
01:03:41,026 --> 01:03:45,155
I can't go down the Black Diamond. I don't
even know how to put on the boots.

1064
01:03:45,613 --> 01:03:49,284
If you're not gonna ski, what are you
planning on doing all weekend?

1065
01:03:49,951 --> 01:03:51,244
I came prepared.

1066
01:03:55,248 --> 01:03:59,878
Oh, no.
That is a major backslide for you. Lucas.

1067
01:03:59,961 --> 01:04:00,962
What's up, dude?

1068
01:04:01,046 --> 01:04:04,007
Can you help me convince LJ
to come ski with us?

1069
01:04:04,549 --> 01:04:09,054
Yeah, right. You think I'm going skiing?
It's cold outside, I don't do cold.

1070
01:04:09,137 --> 01:04:10,138
What?

1071
01:04:11,348 --> 01:04:13,224
Well, I have Korean face masks.

1072
01:04:15,143 --> 01:04:17,812
So you guys have been faking it
this entire time?

1073
01:04:17,896 --> 01:04:21,358
Yes, and you have to promise
not to tell anyone, okay?

1074
01:04:21,441 --> 01:04:24,110
It's just... I'm so confused.

1075
01:04:24,652 --> 01:04:26,071
Just had to let it out.

1076
01:04:27,989 --> 01:04:30,492
I do not care about the genesis
of it all.

1077
01:04:30,617 --> 01:04:34,329
I just know homeboy likes you.
I can tell by the way he looks at you.

1078
01:04:34,412 --> 01:04:38,083
- How does he look at me?
- Like you're a sexy littleÂ Rubik's Cube.

1079
01:04:38,166 --> 01:04:41,294
He can't figure you out,
but he's having fun trying.

1080
01:04:42,045 --> 01:04:46,091
It doesn't matter,
he's still so obsessed with Gen,

1081
01:04:46,466 --> 01:04:49,719
and I'm just another of the stupid girls
who fell for Kavinsky.

1082
01:04:50,011 --> 01:04:51,346
It's embarrassing!

1083
01:04:52,639 --> 01:04:57,477
Look, every guy, you know,
gets a bit obsessed with, at first...

1084
01:04:58,478 --> 01:04:59,521
you know...

1085
01:05:00,188 --> 01:05:02,107
bow chicka wow wow...

1086
01:05:02,774 --> 01:05:05,193
Okay, let's look at the facts, shall we?

1087
01:05:05,985 --> 01:05:10,198
The whole fake relationship was his idea,
you came up with a no-kissing rule,

1088
01:05:10,281 --> 01:05:14,327
you're trying to break up with him,
and you're carb-loading with a gay man

1089
01:05:14,411 --> 01:05:16,496
while he's probably waiting
in the hot tub.

1090
01:05:17,122 --> 01:05:21,876
So I'd say if anyone stupidly fell
for someone who doesn't like them back,

1091
01:05:22,335 --> 01:05:23,336
it's not you.

1092
01:05:24,087 --> 01:05:25,130
It's Kavinsky.

1093
01:05:26,214 --> 01:05:28,299
You think he's waiting for me
in the hot tub?

1094
01:05:28,383 --> 01:05:29,426
Hell yeah!

1095
01:05:34,681 --> 01:05:36,683
"Lovers" by Anna Of The North plays

1096
01:05:43,523 --> 01:05:46,734
âª You told me I would never
See you walk away âª

1097
01:05:46,818 --> 01:05:48,361
All by yourself out here?

1098
01:05:48,445 --> 01:05:50,572
âª Said you'd never break my heart âª

1099
01:05:51,072 --> 01:05:52,866
âª Never leave me in the dark âª

1100
01:05:52,949 --> 01:05:54,868
So what, now you're ignoring me?

1101
01:05:56,161 --> 01:05:57,871
Oh, I'm the one ignoring you?

1102
01:05:59,456 --> 01:06:00,457
That's funny.

1103
01:06:00,915 --> 01:06:02,876
âª Now I'm in the dark âª

1104
01:06:03,751 --> 01:06:05,170
âª Show a little loving âª

1105
01:06:06,004 --> 01:06:08,590
âª Shine a little light on me âª

1106
01:06:08,673 --> 01:06:10,675
âª Show a little loving âª

1107
01:06:11,092 --> 01:06:13,094
âª Shine a little light on me âª

1108
01:06:14,012 --> 01:06:17,599
Sorry I'm not a good skier,
you didn't offer to teach me.

1109
01:06:17,682 --> 01:06:22,270
I'm supposed to be sweet to you
after you don't sit with me on the bus?

1110
01:06:22,353 --> 01:06:26,649
Shouldn't you be thanking me, that you got
to sit next to who you actually wanted?

1111
01:06:30,069 --> 01:06:34,741
For someone who has such good grades,
you can be so dense sometimes.

1112
01:06:34,824 --> 01:06:36,075
- What?
- Yeah.

1113
01:06:36,159 --> 01:06:38,536
I wanted to sit next to you, Lara Jean.

1114
01:06:39,454 --> 01:06:41,498
I even packed the snacks.

1115
01:06:41,581 --> 01:06:45,877
I asked Kitty where to find
those yogurt drinks you like so much.

1116
01:06:46,544 --> 01:06:49,172
The Korean store is all the way
across town.

1117
01:06:49,255 --> 01:06:50,256
I know.

1118
01:06:50,507 --> 01:06:56,221
So if I went all the way across town
to get something you like, that means...

1119
01:06:58,306 --> 01:07:00,058
You must really like yogurt?

1120
01:07:02,393 --> 01:07:03,728
You are impossible.

1121
01:07:15,365 --> 01:07:17,242
Sorry I didn't sit next to you.

1122
01:07:18,952 --> 01:07:19,953
It's alright.

1123
01:07:22,038 --> 01:07:23,790

âª Show a little loving âª

1129
01:07:38,096 --> 01:07:40,848
You're coming in, in your nightgown.

1130
01:07:40,932 --> 01:07:42,725
I didn't bring a bathing suit.

1131
01:07:51,317 --> 01:07:52,318
Hi.

1132
01:07:54,612 --> 01:07:56,447
There's no one like you, Covey.

1133
01:08:04,789 --> 01:08:06,791
âª Shine a little light on me âª

1134

01:08:12,380 --> 01:08:13,298
What?

1137
01:08:14,757 --> 01:08:15,633
Nothing.

1138
01:08:17,427 --> 01:08:19,679
âª Shine a little light on me âª

1139
01:08:20,013 --> 01:08:22,015
âª Show a little loving âª

1140
01:08:25,018 --> 01:08:27,020
âª Show a little loving âª

01:08:27,645 --> 01:08:29,647
âª Show a little loving âª

1142
01:08:48,833 --> 01:08:50,168
Good night, Lara Jean.

1143
01:08:50,418 --> 01:08:51,419
Good night.

1144
01:09:36,798 --> 01:09:37,799
Woo!

1145
01:09:46,974 --> 01:09:47,850
Hey.

1146
01:09:48,810 --> 01:09:53,064
Um... You didn't tell anyone
about last night, did you?

1147
01:09:53,856 --> 01:09:57,777
No, that's just how people act
with couples on the ski trip.

1148
01:09:57,860 --> 01:09:58,986
It's normal.

1149
01:09:59,696 --> 01:10:01,906
Hey, I'm tired. Can I use you as a pillow?

1150
01:10:21,050 --> 01:10:25,471
Hey, Lara Jean. I think it's so cool
that you came out on the ski trip.

1151
01:10:25,555 --> 01:10:26,597
Hope you had fun.

1152
01:10:27,181 --> 01:10:29,642
Gee... Thank you, Gen. I did.

1153
01:10:30,309 --> 01:10:33,688
Also, I just wanted to say
I think it's really big of you,

1154
01:10:33,771 --> 01:10:36,232
being so understanding
about my friendship with Peter.

1155
01:10:37,525 --> 01:10:39,694
- What?
- Oh, I just mean...

1156
01:10:40,111 --> 01:10:42,780
a lot of girls would be pretty weirded out

1157
01:10:42,864 --> 01:10:45,408
by their boyfriend sleeping
in someone else's room,

1158
01:10:45,491 --> 01:10:49,662
but you're so trusting... I remember that
about you from middle school.

1159
01:10:50,455 --> 01:10:54,876
Doesn't your hair always get so greasy
spending three hours on the bus?

1160
01:10:57,587 --> 01:10:59,046
Where did you get that?

1161
01:10:59,922 --> 01:11:04,135
Oh, Peter gave this to me. Isn't it cute?
I love the colors in it.

1162
01:11:05,094 --> 01:11:06,471
Well, have a nice day.

1163
01:11:11,058 --> 01:11:13,853
- Hi. Ready to go?
- Did you go to Gen's room last night?

1164
01:11:15,354 --> 01:11:16,939
Uh, yeah, but...

1165
01:11:17,023 --> 01:11:19,233
And you gave her my favorite scrunchie?

1166
01:11:20,485 --> 01:11:22,236
Am I just a joke to you, Peter?

1167
01:11:22,320 --> 01:11:25,782
No, you're not.
You just don't understand the situation.

1168
01:11:25,865 --> 01:11:27,575
No, I understand completely.

1169
01:11:29,786 --> 01:11:33,122
This is over,
in every possible way.

1170
01:11:33,206 --> 01:11:37,084
Can we just talk about this?
Let me drive you home, I'll explain.

1171
01:11:37,168 --> 01:11:38,669
I would rather walk home.

1172
01:11:39,337 --> 01:11:43,674
Actually, I'd rather drive myself
than get into a car with you right now.

1173
01:12:13,621 --> 01:12:14,789
You're home!

1174
01:12:21,128 --> 01:12:22,922
Did you do this all yourself?

1175
01:12:23,214 --> 01:12:24,465
Well...

1176
01:12:24,841 --> 01:12:26,050
Hey, little sister.

1177
01:12:28,845 --> 01:12:29,762
Oh, my God!

1178
01:12:34,141 --> 01:12:35,393
I missed you so much!

1179
01:12:35,476 --> 01:12:36,602
I missed you.

1180
01:12:39,522 --> 01:12:40,773
Tell us about Scotland.

1181
01:12:41,357 --> 01:12:43,276
Okay. Well, even when it's freezing,

1182
01:12:43,359 --> 01:12:46,487
Scottish girls still wear short shorts
and high heels

1183
01:12:46,571 --> 01:12:48,239
when we go out to bars and stuff.

1184
01:12:48,322 --> 01:12:49,699
You go to bars?

1185
01:12:49,782 --> 01:12:53,160
Everybody does,
the legal drinking age is 18 over there.

1186
01:12:53,244 --> 01:12:55,955
You drink? Who is she?

1187
01:12:56,038 --> 01:12:57,290
She's Margot.

1188
01:12:58,541 --> 01:13:01,586
Are you going to invite Josh over
for dinner?

1189
01:13:03,045 --> 01:13:05,590
- Why don't we make it a girls' night?
- Plus Dad.

1190
01:13:05,673 --> 01:13:07,800
Girls' night plus Dad. Just family.

1191
01:13:07,884 --> 01:13:10,845
- Guess that means you can't invite Peter.
- Peter?

1192
01:13:10,928 --> 01:13:12,555
knocking at door

1193
01:13:13,347 --> 01:13:15,057
I'd better go get that.

1194
01:13:16,809 --> 01:13:17,768
Excuse me.

1195
01:13:21,856 --> 01:13:24,358
Hey. We need to talk.

1196
01:13:25,359 --> 01:13:26,360
Not here.

1197
01:13:32,241 --> 01:13:36,412
Just so you know, nothing happened
between me and Gen last night.

1198
01:13:36,495 --> 01:13:38,998
You went to her room in the first place.

1199
01:13:39,081 --> 01:13:41,792
Look, Gen and I dated for a long time.

1200
01:13:42,168 --> 01:13:45,421
Those feelings aren't just going
to go away, we have history.

1201
01:13:45,504 --> 01:13:49,216
I'm tired of being second best
or fake best.

1202
01:13:49,300 --> 01:13:51,636
- I don't know.
- No, you do not get it.

1203
01:13:52,386 --> 01:13:55,056
- Last night was...
- Last night was a mistake.

1204
01:13:55,848 --> 01:13:59,143
Physical stuff might not be a big deal
to you, but to me, it is.

1205
01:13:59,226 --> 01:14:03,564
- Who says it's not a big deal to me?
- Says every single guy in the bus!

1206
01:14:03,648 --> 01:14:06,984
Clapping and praising you like a god,
and you eat it up.

1207
01:14:07,151 --> 01:14:08,152
Okay. Look, I...

1208
01:14:08,235 --> 01:14:09,570
Peter, just leave.

1209
01:14:09,654 --> 01:14:12,823
- Can we go inside and talk?
- She asked you to leave, buddy.

1210
01:14:12,907 --> 01:14:15,701
- I'm fine. Go back inside.
- No, it's alright.

1211
01:14:15,785 --> 01:14:17,662
No, no. Are you serious now?

1212
01:14:20,915 --> 01:14:24,043
This isn't about Gen and me,
it's about you and Josh!

1213
01:14:24,126 --> 01:14:26,879
Are you kidding me?
This is the reason you broke up with me?

1214
01:14:26,963 --> 01:14:30,341
You're still in love
with this Bon Iver wannabe?

1215
01:14:30,424 --> 01:14:32,510
If Lara Jean broke up with you,
it's because

1216
01:14:32,593 --> 01:14:34,595
she's coming
to the life-altering revelation

1217
01:14:34,679 --> 01:14:37,014
- she's too good for you.
- You're in love with Josh?

1218
01:14:38,140 --> 01:14:39,141
Margot, no...

1219
01:14:48,317 --> 01:14:49,568
Peter, go home!

1220
01:14:52,321 --> 01:14:54,365
God. You were never second best.

1221
01:15:02,748 --> 01:15:06,669
- I didn't know she was home yet.
- Yeah, she finished her exams early.

1222
01:15:07,545 --> 01:15:08,879
It was a surprise.

1223
01:15:10,256 --> 01:15:12,258
car engine turning over

1224
01:15:15,720 --> 01:15:17,388
Guess I'll order a pizza.

1225
01:15:44,832 --> 01:15:47,418
Well, at least the worst is over.

1226
01:15:47,501 --> 01:15:49,336
phone beeps

1227
01:15:57,928 --> 01:16:01,140
Lara Jean screaming

1228
01:16:01,223 --> 01:16:02,266
Women!

1229
01:16:03,225 --> 01:16:04,226
Tell me about it.

1230
01:16:04,518 --> 01:16:06,437
Also... checkmate.

1231
01:16:07,146 --> 01:16:08,105
You...

1232
01:16:11,067 --> 01:16:12,068
I'm busy.

1233
01:16:12,151 --> 01:16:15,071
Wait, Margot, please. I need your help.

1234
01:16:18,991 --> 01:16:19,992
Well...

1235
01:16:20,701 --> 01:16:23,537
You're completely covered up
and we only see your back.

1236
01:16:23,621 --> 01:16:25,915
If you hadn't been tagged,
it could be anybody.

1237
01:16:26,082 --> 01:16:28,709
It's worse for Peter than it is for you.

1238
01:16:28,793 --> 01:16:30,586
It's never worse for the guys.

1239
01:16:31,337 --> 01:16:33,464
God, how did I let this happen?

1240
01:16:33,547 --> 01:16:35,174
I'm so stupid.

1241
01:16:37,218 --> 01:16:38,260
Hey...

1242
01:16:39,220 --> 01:16:40,221
LJ.

1243
01:16:41,138 --> 01:16:43,682
We're gonna fix this. Give me the pillow.

1244
01:16:43,933 --> 01:16:44,934
Come on.

1245
01:16:48,896 --> 01:16:50,606
I know you're only being nice to me

1246
01:16:50,689 --> 01:16:53,484
'cause I accidentally made a sex tape
and you feel bad.

1247
01:16:53,734 --> 01:16:55,236
I do feel bad for you.

1248
01:16:56,070 --> 01:16:59,031
But I also don't understand
why you didn't tell me

1249
01:16:59,115 --> 01:17:01,534
all this was happening
in the first place.

1250
01:17:01,617 --> 01:17:05,162
- I thought you were going to hate me.
- I could never hate you.

1251
01:17:05,621 --> 01:17:06,914
But when I heard Peter,

1252
01:17:06,997 --> 01:17:10,960
I thought you were trying
to date Josh now or something.

1253
01:17:11,043 --> 01:17:13,796
How could you think
I would do that to you?

1254
01:17:13,879 --> 01:17:15,256
You're my sister.

1255
01:17:15,339 --> 01:17:18,843
You wouldn't even Skype with me,
what am I supposed to think?

1256
01:17:22,012 --> 01:17:23,556
I wouldn't Skype with you

1257
01:17:23,639 --> 01:17:27,476
because I was lying to every person,
and I knew I couldn't lie to you.

1258
01:17:28,811 --> 01:17:30,938
I thought you didn't need me anymore.

1259
01:17:32,439 --> 01:17:36,569
Are you kidding me?
Look what happened when you were gone!

1260
01:17:36,694 --> 01:17:39,989
I made a sex tape,
and I haven't even had sex!

1261
01:17:40,990 --> 01:17:42,158
Come here.

1262
01:17:46,412 --> 01:17:48,122
How long have you been there?

1263
01:17:49,373 --> 01:17:50,666
Not long...

1264
01:17:51,917 --> 01:17:52,918
Long.

1265
01:17:59,049 --> 01:18:03,512
Okay, let's make a pact.
No more secrets between the Covey girls.

1266
01:18:05,723 --> 01:18:06,724
But...

1267
01:18:07,850 --> 01:18:09,602
I have a secret, too.

1268
01:18:13,522 --> 01:18:14,857
I sent the letters.

1269
01:18:17,234 --> 01:18:18,652
I'm gonna kill you.

1270
01:18:19,486 --> 01:18:20,946
No, Lara Jean! No!

1271
01:18:21,030 --> 01:18:22,573
She's a kid!

1272
01:18:23,073 --> 01:18:25,910
You were so lonely
and I could tell Peter liked you.

1273
01:18:25,993 --> 01:18:29,830
- I knew you wouldn't do anything about it.
- So you sent all five?

1274
01:18:29,914 --> 01:18:32,917
I thought five chances
at a boyfriend was better odds!

1275
01:18:33,000 --> 01:18:36,253
- I miss having him over for dinner.
- Alright!

1276
01:18:36,670 --> 01:18:37,880
Give me the unicorn.

1277
01:18:38,714 --> 01:18:42,218
Look, her logic was off,
but her heart was in the right place.

1278
01:18:42,301 --> 01:18:44,678
Her face is gonna be in the wrong place!

1279
01:18:44,762 --> 01:18:49,475
Lara Jean, before you murder our sister,
could I just ask you a question?

1280
01:18:49,808 --> 01:18:53,604
If you didn't want those letters
to be sent, why did you address them?

1281
01:18:54,563 --> 01:18:56,565
It's not like I added a stamp!

1282
01:18:56,649 --> 01:19:00,069
Can you admit that some part of you
doesn't want everything in your life

1283
01:19:00,152 --> 01:19:01,153
to be a fantasy?

1284
01:19:02,529 --> 01:19:04,240
- Maybe.
- So...

1285
01:19:04,323 --> 01:19:08,452
If I can forgive you
for writing my boyfriend a love letter,

1286
01:19:08,535 --> 01:19:11,247
do you think you could forgive Kitty
for sending them?

1287
01:19:13,040 --> 01:19:16,543
You owe me braid crowns
for the rest of your life.

1288
01:19:17,336 --> 01:19:20,881
Thank God. I was really hoping
to make it to seventh grade.

1289
01:19:22,591 --> 01:19:23,592
Oh, yeah.

1290
01:19:23,676 --> 01:19:27,513
It didn't feel like Christmas knowing
my hot tub escapades had gone viral,

1291
01:19:27,596 --> 01:19:30,891
but, of course,
Margot know exactly what to do

1292
01:19:30,975 --> 01:19:34,603
and anonymously emailed Instagram
to have them take the videos down

1293
01:19:34,687 --> 01:19:36,438
under child pornography laws.

1294
01:19:36,522 --> 01:19:38,983
I couldn't believe
I had inadvertently dabbled in porn

1295
01:19:39,066 --> 01:19:43,195
before I lost my virginity,
but it's been a strange year all around.

1296
01:19:43,279 --> 01:19:46,073
Okay, you're officially PG-13 again.

1297
01:19:50,160 --> 01:19:52,705
I guess I should change my background

1298
01:19:52,788 --> 01:19:55,249
You could, or you could talk to him.

1299
01:19:57,543 --> 01:20:00,337
New Year's Eve, a time for resolutions.

1300
01:20:01,088 --> 01:20:03,549
"Video Child" by Many Voices Speak plays

1301
01:20:03,632 --> 01:20:05,175
My life was a mess, but...

1302
01:20:06,343 --> 01:20:07,720
I could clean my room.

1303
01:20:15,936 --> 01:20:19,315
âª And now you're never
Gonna get hurt again âª

1304
01:20:19,398 --> 01:20:20,816
Yep, she's cleaning...

1305
01:20:21,525 --> 01:20:22,985
It must be really bad.

1306
01:20:27,865 --> 01:20:32,328
âª And no, you're never
Gonna get hurt again âª

1307
01:20:34,330 --> 01:20:37,166
- Can you guys hang out for a while?
- Yeah, course.

1308
01:20:38,334 --> 01:20:39,335
Hey.

1309
01:20:41,462 --> 01:20:42,880
Let's go for a drive.

1310
01:20:50,721 --> 01:20:52,681
There it is, right there.

1311
01:20:52,765 --> 01:20:55,642
"Everybody Wants to Rule the World"
by Tears for Fears plays on jukebox

1312
01:20:55,726 --> 01:20:58,771
Your mother and I used to come here
all the time.

1313
01:20:58,854 --> 01:21:00,564
Really? I didn't know that.

1314
01:21:01,065 --> 01:21:05,194
She'd play this song, then as soon
as it was over she'd play it again.

1315
01:21:05,861 --> 01:21:09,656
Know what else she'd do? Get up
and start dancing in the aisles,

1316
01:21:09,740 --> 01:21:12,951
right by everyone eating.
I was so embarrassed, but...

1317
01:21:13,535 --> 01:21:16,038
you know, I was also in awe of her, too.

1318
01:21:16,413 --> 01:21:20,709
I think back and I think,
"Man, I should've been dancing with her."

1319
01:21:21,835 --> 01:21:23,212
Look at this.

1320
01:21:24,838 --> 01:21:27,549
Wow, this place has not changed at all.

1321
01:21:28,550 --> 01:21:31,845
There's so much about her
I should have told you girls,

1322
01:21:31,929 --> 01:21:34,640
but I haven't
because talking about her makes me sad.

1323
01:21:34,723 --> 01:21:35,891
It's okay.

1324
01:21:36,350 --> 01:21:37,601
It's not okay.

1325
01:21:37,684 --> 01:21:42,147
I've relied on you and Margot too much,
I know I have.

1326
01:21:42,898 --> 01:21:46,193
You're 16.
You don't have to be an adult yet.

1327
01:21:46,276 --> 01:21:48,904
That's why I was so happy
when I saw you and Peter.

1328
01:21:48,987 --> 01:21:51,740
- I don't want to talk about Peter.
- Peter who?

1329
01:21:51,824 --> 01:21:52,825
Really?

1330
01:21:53,951 --> 01:21:56,328
I don't know what happened with you two,

1331
01:21:56,412 --> 01:21:59,832
but I know how you opened up
when he was around.

1332
01:21:59,915 --> 01:22:04,503
Not with us, 'cause you've always been
like that with us, but to the world.

1333
01:22:05,129 --> 01:22:08,048
Seeing you come alive like that,
you remind me of her.

1334
01:22:10,175 --> 01:22:12,803
Just don't hide that part of yourself,
okay?

1335
01:22:17,724 --> 01:22:19,309
Dad, I really miss her.

1336
01:22:21,770 --> 01:22:22,896
I know you do.

1337
01:22:30,028 --> 01:22:31,655
Can I borrow a quarter?

1338
01:22:32,698 --> 01:22:33,699
Yeah.

1339
01:22:34,992 --> 01:22:35,993
Catch.

1340
01:22:38,745 --> 01:22:41,582
So you said
she'd always play the song twice?

1341
01:22:41,665 --> 01:22:44,710
At least,
usually till they'd kick us outta here.

1342
01:22:44,793 --> 01:22:47,212
"Everybody Wants to Rule the World"
plays again

1343
01:22:47,296 --> 01:22:48,297
Cool.

1344
01:22:54,636 --> 01:22:58,098
Well, like,
I didn't hear anything about it, though.

1345
01:22:58,557 --> 01:23:01,935
The Debate Society's New Year's Eve
nitrous oxide scandal

1346
01:23:02,019 --> 01:23:04,021
knocked it out of top spot.

1347
01:23:04,104 --> 01:23:06,106
Okay, so that's good news, right?

1348
01:23:06,315 --> 01:23:08,650
I'm officially back to being invisible.

1349
01:23:09,693 --> 01:23:10,694
Hey...

1350
01:23:29,755 --> 01:23:32,299
Whoa, whoa. Hey, hey, hey.
What's going on?

1351
01:23:32,382 --> 01:23:36,929
You didn't even say it wasn't true?
You just let everyone think we had sex?

1352
01:23:37,638 --> 01:23:39,723
I bet you're happy the video leaked.

1353
01:23:41,308 --> 01:23:43,310
You gonna do something about this?

1354
01:23:43,810 --> 01:23:45,437
Hey, everyone, listen up.

1355
01:23:46,063 --> 01:23:50,359
Not that it's anyone's business,
but nothing happened in the hot tub.

1356
01:23:51,235 --> 01:23:55,739
If I hear anybody talking about Lara Jean
or that video, I'm gonna kick your asses.

1357
01:23:55,822 --> 01:23:57,157
You understand?

1358
01:23:59,743 --> 01:24:01,370
Nice job, Kavinsky!

1359
01:24:02,663 --> 01:24:04,206
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

1360
01:24:04,540 --> 01:24:08,835
Look, I am really sorry about everything.
If I knew who did this...

1361
01:24:08,919 --> 01:24:10,420
I know who did it.

1362
01:24:10,837 --> 01:24:11,964
So should you.

1363
01:24:13,632 --> 01:24:15,842
Yeah, okay. Let me talk to her, okay?

1364
01:24:15,926 --> 01:24:18,637
No.
This is a fight I have to handle myself.

1365
01:24:24,184 --> 01:24:26,562
Um, hi... Personal space, much?

1366
01:24:26,645 --> 01:24:28,438
I know you posted that video.

1367
01:24:29,356 --> 01:24:31,024
Nope, wasn't me.

1368
01:24:31,608 --> 01:24:36,446
But just so you know,
if you have sex in a public place,

1369
01:24:36,530 --> 01:24:38,240
you've gotta deal with consequences.

1370
01:24:38,323 --> 01:24:43,161
It's bad enough if a guy were to do this,
but a girl? That's despicable.

1371
01:24:43,829 --> 01:24:45,914
Yeah, like I said, I didn't do it.

1372
01:24:46,832 --> 01:24:52,087
I'm glad someone did, though. Finally,
everyone is gonna see who you really are.

1373
01:24:52,170 --> 01:24:53,547
What are you talking about?

1374
01:24:53,630 --> 01:24:57,050
Peter! He is not as confident
as he pretends to be.

1375
01:24:58,176 --> 01:25:01,096
I am not as tough as I pretend to be.

1376
01:25:02,014 --> 01:25:04,725
And you, Lara Jean Covey,

1377
01:25:04,808 --> 01:25:07,561
you are not as innocent
as you pretend to be

1378
01:25:07,644 --> 01:25:09,730
because you kissed a boy I liked.

1379
01:25:09,813 --> 01:25:11,398
You guys were broken up.

1380
01:25:11,481 --> 01:25:13,233
No, before we even dated!

1381
01:25:14,192 --> 01:25:17,738
- Middle school?
- You knew I liked him and you kissed him.

1382
01:25:17,821 --> 01:25:20,699
It was Spin the Bottle, you psycho,
and it was tongueless!

1383
01:25:20,782 --> 01:25:22,200
It wasn't tongueless to me!

1384
01:25:26,413 --> 01:25:27,456
door slams shut

1385
01:25:27,539 --> 01:25:31,084
I always thought no one was paying
attention to what I was doing,

1386
01:25:32,628 --> 01:25:35,380
that the only drama in my life
was in my head,

1387
01:25:37,215 --> 01:25:40,636
but it turns out that
I wasn't as invisible as I thought.

1388
01:25:43,013 --> 01:25:45,932
- So Margot left, huh?
- Yeah, this Sunday.

1389
01:25:47,017 --> 01:25:48,852
Hey, thank you for coming over.

1390
01:25:48,935 --> 01:25:50,520
Yeah, of course.

1391
01:25:50,604 --> 01:25:53,106
I feel like I owe you an explanation.

1392
01:25:53,899 --> 01:25:54,941
See...

1393
01:25:55,525 --> 01:25:57,110
It's like driving, okay?

1394
01:25:57,194 --> 01:25:59,821
I can imagine myself doing it
and it's fine,

1395
01:25:59,905 --> 01:26:02,741
and then I get behind the wheel
and completely freeze up,

1396
01:26:02,824 --> 01:26:04,493
and I don't know what to do.

1397
01:26:04,576 --> 01:26:08,413
Okay... I don't follow.

1398
01:26:10,040 --> 01:26:11,291
Let me start over.

1399
01:26:14,169 --> 01:26:16,713
You were the first boy
I ever really liked.

1400
01:26:17,464 --> 01:26:20,509
Everyone else, all the other letters,
were born out of fantasy.

1401
01:26:22,010 --> 01:26:24,680
But yours was based off
of actually knowing you.

1402
01:26:26,640 --> 01:26:31,311
I didn't realize how I felt about you
until you became Margot's boyfriend.

1403
01:26:34,022 --> 01:26:37,025
But over time,
that feeling just faded away,

1404
01:26:37,109 --> 01:26:38,819
and I missed my best friend.

1405
01:26:39,611 --> 01:26:40,904
And it wasn't love.

1406
01:26:42,030 --> 01:26:46,159
Why didn't you just tell me that?
I feel like I'd have understood.

1407
01:26:46,243 --> 01:26:50,080
Well, I couldn't.
I didn't know until Peter.

1408
01:26:53,750 --> 01:26:55,752
Right, Peter.

1409
01:26:57,337 --> 01:26:59,172
It was real in a different way.

1410
01:27:00,924 --> 01:27:02,259
And I'm really sorry.

1411
01:27:03,635 --> 01:27:08,557
No reason to be sorry, it's like,
I think I know where you're coming from.

1412
01:27:08,640 --> 01:27:10,767
It's kind of how it was with Margot and I.

1413
01:27:11,893 --> 01:27:15,063
You know, minus all the fake stuff
and everything else.

1414
01:27:16,523 --> 01:27:19,317
Did you stop loving Margot
after she broke up with you?

1415
01:27:20,235 --> 01:27:22,821
No. Not at first.

1416
01:27:25,741 --> 01:27:27,826
At some point it changed, though.

1417
01:27:28,577 --> 01:27:33,623
The longer she was gone,
the more I understood why she ended it.

1418
01:27:37,335 --> 01:27:41,256
- Do you feel the same way about Peter?
- I know you don't like him.

1419
01:27:42,924 --> 01:27:45,427
I like how he stood up for you today.

1420
01:27:45,510 --> 01:27:47,345
He should have done it a lot sooner,

1421
01:27:47,471 --> 01:27:50,849
but then again, he's a jock,
and they're slow learners.

1422
01:27:51,183 --> 01:27:52,476
You are such a snob!

1423
01:27:52,934 --> 01:27:53,935
Yeah.

1424
01:27:55,645 --> 01:27:58,690
Look, if you miss him,
why don't you just tell him?

1425
01:27:59,483 --> 01:28:00,317
I can't.

1426
01:28:01,318 --> 01:28:02,486
And why's that?

1427
01:28:04,905 --> 01:28:07,741
Because if it wasn't real,
I didn't lose anyone.

1428
01:28:09,618 --> 01:28:13,497
But if I say that it was real,
and he still doesn't want me...

1429
01:28:15,248 --> 01:28:16,792
Then at least you'll know.

1430
01:28:17,417 --> 01:28:20,754
You've gotta tell people
how you feel when you feel it.

1431
01:28:21,171 --> 01:28:25,091
You can't sit in your room writing
love letters you're never gonna send.

1432
01:28:25,258 --> 01:28:27,427
Peter wouldn't even be in your life

1433
01:28:27,511 --> 01:28:29,679
if they hadn't gotten out
in the first place.

1434
01:28:29,763 --> 01:28:32,140
Yeah, you definitely have a point.

1435
01:28:33,350 --> 01:28:36,561
I don't know, I'm just tired
of writing love letters.

1436
01:28:36,937 --> 01:28:39,064
It'd be nice to be receiving them.

1437
01:28:39,815 --> 01:28:42,317
Lara Jean, I have something for you.

1438
01:28:43,109 --> 01:28:44,402
Don't kill me.

1439
01:28:45,278 --> 01:28:48,406
It's just,
you were always throwing those away,

1440
01:28:49,074 --> 01:28:52,327
and I thought they were something
you should keep.

1441
01:28:53,912 --> 01:28:55,372
You saved all these?

1442
01:29:03,129 --> 01:29:04,381
"Lara Jean,

1443
01:29:04,464 --> 01:29:07,676
everyone was so impressed
by your presentation in lit,

1444
01:29:08,009 --> 01:29:09,386
but especially me.

1445
01:29:09,886 --> 01:29:12,764
I love having
a smarty pants fake girlfriend."

1446
01:29:19,229 --> 01:29:22,607
"It's so cool how we can talk
to each other about real stuff."

1447
01:29:28,905 --> 01:29:30,532
"You looked so pretty today."

1448
01:29:32,951 --> 01:29:35,287
Still think
you haven't gotten a love letter?

1449
01:30:41,645 --> 01:30:42,687
Hey.

1450
01:30:44,022 --> 01:30:46,650
Hi. I have to tell you something.

1451
01:30:50,528 --> 01:30:51,529
Okay.

1452
01:30:53,114 --> 01:30:54,366
I drove here.

1453
01:30:56,493 --> 01:30:57,494
Really?

1454
01:30:59,245 --> 01:31:02,916
Wow, that's... that's...
that's great, congrats.

1455
01:31:05,001 --> 01:31:06,628
- Thanks.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

1456
01:31:09,381 --> 01:31:10,548
What's in your hand?

1457
01:31:11,883 --> 01:31:13,009
Oh, uh, nothing.

1458
01:31:13,718 --> 01:31:14,761
Oh, it's nothing?

1459
01:31:22,560 --> 01:31:25,814
If you want me to read that,
you need to give that to me.

1460
01:31:29,025 --> 01:31:29,985
Um...

1461
01:31:31,403 --> 01:31:32,737
Can you turn around?

1462
01:31:34,489 --> 01:31:35,490
Please.

1463
01:31:44,332 --> 01:31:45,333
"Dear Peter,

1464
01:31:46,459 --> 01:31:48,086
I need you to know that..."

1465
01:32:00,015 --> 01:32:03,018
I need you to know that I like you,
Peter Kavinsky.

1466
01:32:04,144 --> 01:32:05,520
And not in a fake way.

1467
01:32:08,148 --> 01:32:11,151
And so I guess
that's all I came here to say.

1468
01:32:14,863 --> 01:32:18,825
Whoa, whoa, whoa...
Don't I get to say something?

1469
01:32:22,245 --> 01:32:25,832
The reason
that I went to Gen's room that night,

1470
01:32:27,375 --> 01:32:28,918
was to tell her that it's over,

1471
01:32:30,712 --> 01:32:31,713
because...

1472
01:32:35,925 --> 01:32:38,011
because I'm in love with you, Lara Jean.

1473
01:32:39,429 --> 01:32:40,430
Only you.

1474
01:32:42,223 --> 01:32:43,224
You're what?

1475
01:32:45,226 --> 01:32:49,522
- Wait... How do we do this?
- What do you mean?

1476
01:32:50,440 --> 01:32:53,359
What do you put into a contract
for a real relationship?

1477
01:32:53,443 --> 01:32:54,486
Nothing.

1478
01:32:56,613 --> 01:32:57,822
You gotta trust.

1479
01:33:02,994 --> 01:33:04,913
You gonna break my heart, Covey?

"Cool Out" by Matthew E. White

1481
01:33:08,041 --> 01:33:11,336
I'd always fantasized
about falling in love in a field,

1482
01:33:12,295 --> 01:33:16,382
but I just never thought it'd be the kind
where you played lacrosse.

1483
01:33:16,466 --> 01:33:18,593
âª If you were here now, I wouldn't mind âª

1484
