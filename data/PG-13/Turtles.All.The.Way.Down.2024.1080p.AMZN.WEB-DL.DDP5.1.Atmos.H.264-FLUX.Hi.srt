are almost 50% microbial?

That means half the cells
that make up your body

5
00:00:54,865 --> 00:00:57,552
don't even belong to you.

6
00:00:57,576 --> 00:01:03,099
They belong to these tiny, microscopic
organisms crawling inside of you.

7
00:01:03,123 --> 00:01:06,585
So, if you think about
it, there is no you.

8
00:01:07,795 --> 00:01:09,189
You're not real.

00:01:09,213 --> 00:01:11,316

16
00:01:29,441 --> 00:01:31,527
Because you've told me before.

00:01:33,654 --> 00:01:35,006
When was the last time

18
00:01:35,030 --> 00:01:37,030
you had the urge to open
the callus on your finger?

Yes.

Okay.

Sometimes.

27
00:02:00,222 --> 00:02:03,517
You have to take your medication every
day, for it to work. You know that.

00:02:07,563 --> 00:02:08,814
What are you thinking?

29
00:02:10,149 --> 00:02:12,192
I was thinking it's not fair

30
00:02:14,194 --> 00:02:16,673
that you and every other
normal person can know

31
00:02:16,697 --> 00:02:18,633
you're covered in bacteria
and not give a shit.

32
00:02:18,657 --> 00:02:20,552
- I don't like the word "normal."
- And I don't like the words

33
00:02:20,576 --> 00:02:23,704
that you write on your
notepad to describe me,

34
00:02:25,622 --> 00:02:26,975
but if the shoe fits.

35
00:02:26,999 --> 00:02:28,476
Sure, they acknowledge
you're struggling,

36
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:31,688
but they also reflect
that you are so much more

37
00:02:31,712 --> 00:02:33,481
than your OCD.

38
00:02:33,505 --> 00:02:35,942
You're smart, and
creative, and thoughtful.

39
00:02:35,966 --> 00:02:38,844
Okay, thank you. But,
please, just stop.

40
00:02:41,555 --> 00:02:44,057
So, you wish you were
more like normal people?

00:02:44,892 --> 00:02:46,327
No.

He's Mychal 101.

100
00:05:29,097 --> 00:05:31,743
I used Photoshop to average the

- but spelled with a "Y" like me.
- static crackles

102
00:05:33,977 --> 00:05:36,414
And the average of
their faces became him.

You can feel them living, and

111
00:05:57,959 --> 00:05:59,437
Your body is nothing but a host

112
00:05:59,461 --> 00:06:01,272

Holmsey, are you listening?

116
00:06:07,677 --> 00:06:09,947
Aza I am listening to the

- What?
- They went to camp.

Aza It's too loud.

125
00:06:24,111 --> 00:06:26,047
Why is it so loud?

126
00:06:26,071 --> 00:06:28,925
Excessive abdominal
noise is an uncommon

127
00:06:28,949 --> 00:06:32,595
but not unprecedented, symptom
of a C. Diff infection.

128
00:06:32,619 --> 00:06:35,205
Even moderate C. Diff
infections can quickly worsen.

129
00:06:36,373 --> 00:06:38,059
Damage to the intestinal lining

130
00:06:38,083 --> 00:06:42,814
causes bacteria to spill
into the abdominal cavity,

131
00:06:42,838 --> 00:06:45,382
leading to a
life-threatening infection.

132
00:06:49,427 --> 00:06:51,072
You need to change the Band-Aid.

133
00:06:51,096 --> 00:06:52,907
You're probably infected.

134
00:06:52,931 --> 00:06:54,742
You need to drain the infection.
Drain it and clean it.

135
00:06:54,766 --> 00:06:56,685
Put on a new Band-Aid
before it gets any worse.

136
00:06:59,271 --> 00:07:00,730
I gotta go to my locker.

137
00:07:02,607 --> 00:07:05,086
Most C. Diff cases
occur in hospitals.

138
00:07:05,110 --> 00:07:09,423
You haven't been to a hospital, but
you're sweating and you feel hot.

139
00:07:09,447 --> 00:07:11,467
You probably have a fever.

140
00:07:11,491 --> 00:07:14,971
A fever is also a
symptom of C. Diff.

141
00:07:14,995 --> 00:07:17,330
- Stop it, you don't have a fever.
- door closes

142
00:07:19,416 --> 00:07:21,168
You don't have a fever yet.

143
00:07:23,753 --> 00:07:27,275
How could you forget
to change the Band-Aid?

144
00:07:27,299 --> 00:07:29,092
I really don't think I did.

145
00:07:31,219 --> 00:07:33,781
You did, you forgot to change
it, and now it's too late.

146
00:07:33,805 --> 00:07:35,575
You have C. Diff,
and you're gonna

Daisy Well, tomorrow, we're gonna
hang out on my lunch break, right?

152
00:07:58,455 --> 00:08:01,392
And by "hang out" I mean, you're
gonna pick me up on my lunch break?

153
00:08:01,416 --> 00:08:03,227
- Sure.
- Thank God.

154
00:08:03,251 --> 00:08:06,338
I'll see you tomorrow. Love you.

155
00:08:07,505 --> 00:08:08,733

sometime tomorrow afternoon?

166
00:08:33,907 --> 00:08:35,593
I barely get to see
you during the week.

167
00:08:35,617 --> 00:08:37,661
I'm hanging out with Daisy.

00:08:38,828 --> 00:08:40,139
Maybe Sunday then?

Hey, everybody.

172
00:08:45,835 --> 00:08:49,023
Professor Abbott on video Schopenhauer
once said, "Man can do what he wills,

173
00:08:49,047 --> 00:08:51,484
but he cannot will
what he wills."

174
00:08:51,508 --> 00:08:53,194
Our motives may
be predetermined,

175
00:08:53,218 --> 00:08:55,738
but it's up to us how
we act on those motives.

176
00:08:55,762 --> 00:08:57,949
And consider this.

177
00:08:57,973 --> 00:09:01,827
If you alter a mouse's microbiome, the
colonies of bacteria in its stomach,

178
00:09:01,851 --> 00:09:04,163
the mouse will suddenly
seek out different foods

179
00:09:04,187 --> 00:09:05,427
knocking on window gasps

180
00:09:07,983 --> 00:09:11,045
window creaking open

181
00:09:11,069 --> 00:09:13,631
Horrible news. I
drew the short straw,

182
00:09:13,655 --> 00:09:17,218
which means I have to get in the
freakin' Kenny the chinchilla costume.

183
00:09:17,242 --> 00:09:19,303
And B.O. Brian was
in it all morning.

184
00:09:19,327 --> 00:09:22,455
So, let's make this
lunch break count.

185
00:09:28,086 --> 00:09:29,814
Really?

186
00:09:29,838 --> 00:09:31,691
You know you're not allowed to
drink non-clear liquids in Harold.

187
00:09:31,715 --> 00:09:34,509
It's vanilla. It's
clear-adjacent.

188
00:09:36,594 --> 00:09:37,613
Fine.

189
00:09:37,637 --> 00:09:38,763
sucking

190
00:09:42,267 --> 00:09:43,369
Empty.

191
00:09:43,393 --> 00:09:45,538
- Happy?
- Mm-hmm.

192
00:09:45,562 --> 00:09:46,562
lock clicks

193
00:09:48,315 --> 00:09:50,442
Daisy clicks tongue, sighs

194
00:09:51,276 --> 00:09:52,336
Happy, Harold?

195
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:53,838
Yes, he is.

196
00:09:53,862 --> 00:09:55,673
- engine starts
- For what it's worth,

197
00:09:55,697 --> 00:09:57,675
your dad is definitely smiling
down from the great beyond,

198
00:09:57,699 --> 00:09:59,802
proud of how anal you're
being about his old car.

199
00:09:59,826 --> 00:10:01,846
chuckles Radio or the CD?

200
00:10:01,870 --> 00:10:03,973
CD, always.

201
00:10:03,997 --> 00:10:06,559
Just think, of all the CDs that
could have gotten stuck in here...

202
00:10:06,583 --> 00:10:08,060
player beeps

203
00:10:08,084 --> 00:10:09,687
it wound up being the
greatest album of all time.

204
00:10:09,711 --> 00:10:11,022
chuckles

We'll do a veggie burger for
milady. Hold everything but the bun.

227
00:11:06,601 --> 00:11:09,580
And a blazin' Texan for me.

228
00:11:09,604 --> 00:11:12,208
Extra blazing, if
that's possible.

229
00:11:12,232 --> 00:11:13,709
I'm having a day.

230
00:11:13,733 --> 00:11:15,252
Let me guess, you have a coupon?

231
00:11:15,276 --> 00:11:16,945
Daisy We do, in fact.

232
00:11:20,490 --> 00:11:21,634
Anything to drink?

233
00:11:21,658 --> 00:11:24,553
What are we,
heiresses? Two waters.

234
00:11:24,577 --> 00:11:26,704
If you tip me in quarters
again, I swear to God.

235
00:11:28,123 --> 00:11:30,559
Why is Davis on the news?

236
00:11:30,583 --> 00:11:34,105
Daisy Because his dad is missing.
That's what I was talking about.

237
00:11:34,129 --> 00:11:35,731
You didn't hear me say that?

238
00:11:35,755 --> 00:11:37,441
newscaster Billionaire,
Russell Pickett, seemingly...

239
00:11:37,465 --> 00:11:39,360
Do you hear me now?

240
00:11:39,384 --> 00:11:41,654
Pickett Engineering was working
on a massive construction project

241
00:11:41,678 --> 00:11:44,365
designed to clean sewage
from the White River

242
00:11:44,389 --> 00:11:47,701
by expanding existing tunnels
and diverting the creek

243
00:11:47,725 --> 00:11:49,620
\an8known as Pogue's Run.

244
00:11:49,644 --> 00:11:51,288
\an8Pickett had likely
been tipped off

245
00:11:51,312 --> 00:11:54,458
\an8that he was being charged
with fraud and bribery

246
00:11:54,482 --> 00:11:56,502
\an8and that his arrest
was imminent.

247
00:11:56,526 --> 00:11:59,588
\an8- Yikes.
- Mr. Pickett is a widower with two sons,

248
00:11:59,612 --> 00:12:01,215
\an8Davis and Noah.

249
00:12:01,239 --> 00:12:04,385
\an8Detective Dwight Allen gave
us more details on the search.

250
00:12:04,409 --> 00:12:07,888
Dwight The FBI is
offering a $100,000 reward

251
00:12:07,912 --> 00:12:09,598
for anyone who has information

252
00:12:09,622 --> 00:12:12,059
that would lead to the
discovery of Mr. Pickett.

253
00:12:12,083 --> 00:12:14,812
- Holy shit!
- Anyone with any pertinent information

254
00:12:14,836 --> 00:12:17,148
- about this investigation should contact...
- Holy shit!

255
00:12:17,172 --> 00:12:19,984
Who do you think is taking
care of Davis and Noah?

256
00:12:20,008 --> 00:12:23,070
Probably one of their
bajillion servants.

257
00:12:23,094 --> 00:12:26,198
They're rich. Rich
people are always fine.

258
00:12:26,222 --> 00:12:31,078
I think you're missing the
takeaway here, which is $100,000.

259
00:12:31,102 --> 00:12:32,288
What about it?

260
00:12:32,312 --> 00:12:35,040
You and Davis used
to be friends.

261
00:12:35,064 --> 00:12:37,650
Yeah, for one
summer at sad camp.

262
00:12:40,195 --> 00:12:41,672
He might not even remember me.

263
00:12:41,696 --> 00:12:43,907
He'll remember you. That
shit bonds you for life.

264
00:12:44,949 --> 00:12:46,719
And you're memorable.

265
00:12:46,743 --> 00:12:48,137
Even if he does,

266
00:12:48,161 --> 00:12:50,389
it doesn't mean I know how
to find his missing dad.

267
00:12:50,413 --> 00:12:53,350
Okay, but it gives us a
leg up on everyone else.

268
00:12:53,374 --> 00:12:57,730
We are not people to turn our noses
up at a hundred grand, Holmsey.

269
00:12:57,754 --> 00:13:02,276
I am currently washing ball
pit balls for $8.40 an hour.

270
00:13:02,300 --> 00:13:04,528
Do you know what I'm
washing off the balls?

271
00:13:04,552 --> 00:13:05,553
Do you?

272
00:13:06,846 --> 00:13:08,782
- It's pee.
- Mmm.

273
00:13:08,806 --> 00:13:12,453
It's pee, Aza. Pee-pee.

274
00:13:12,477 --> 00:13:13,621
Yeah, okay.

275
00:13:13,645 --> 00:13:15,539
And as much as I
would love to think

276
00:13:15,563 --> 00:13:17,458
that my Star Wars fanfic is
going to make me stupid rich,

277
00:13:17,482 --> 00:13:19,376
just can't rely
on that right now.

278
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:22,213
Ergo, we owe it to ourselves,

279
00:13:22,237 --> 00:13:26,783
to our families, and to our futures
to try and get this 100 grand.

280
00:13:28,952 --> 00:13:31,347
That kind of money,
we could order sodas.

281
00:13:31,371 --> 00:13:33,307
curious music playing

282
00:13:33,331 --> 00:13:35,518
I just don't get how Russell Pickett
disappeared without anyone knowing.

283
00:13:35,542 --> 00:13:38,479
I mean, don't rich people have
a bunch of security cameras

284
00:13:38,503 --> 00:13:39,980
in their manors?

285
00:13:40,004 --> 00:13:44,777
Like, to make sure that
nobody steals their jewels?

286
00:13:44,801 --> 00:13:46,970
Actually, they only
have one camera.

287
00:13:47,679 --> 00:13:49,323
How do you know?

288
00:13:49,347 --> 00:13:51,825
After that summer at camp, Davis
invited me to his 13th birthday.

289
00:13:51,849 --> 00:13:54,036
Some kid got him this
motion capture camera

290
00:13:54,060 --> 00:13:55,579
because he was really
into tracking animals,

291
00:13:55,603 --> 00:13:57,248
and in front of everyone,

292
00:13:57,272 --> 00:13:59,333
his dad just turned all cold
and said he couldn't keep it.

293
00:13:59,357 --> 00:14:00,501
Why?

294
00:14:00,525 --> 00:14:02,419
Uh, because...

295
00:14:02,443 --> 00:14:04,588
imitating Russell "Privacy is the
most important thing you can have,

296
00:14:04,612 --> 00:14:06,882
and if you don't have
that, you have nothing."

297
00:14:06,906 --> 00:14:08,884
scoffs

298
00:14:08,908 --> 00:14:11,428
It's a pretty crazy speech to give a kid
who's just trying to enjoy his birthday

299
00:14:11,452 --> 00:14:14,431
and not be sad
about his dead mom.

300
00:14:14,455 --> 00:14:15,641
Seriously.

301
00:14:15,665 --> 00:14:17,268
Anyway, uh, Davis got upset,

302
00:14:17,292 --> 00:14:20,729
and, finally, his dad
caved and let him keep it.

303
00:14:20,753 --> 00:14:21,814
Huh.

304
00:14:21,838 --> 00:14:23,399
No, no, no, don't...

305
00:14:23,423 --> 00:14:24,567
- Don't lean.
- music stops

306
00:14:24,591 --> 00:14:26,342
Sorry. Sorry.

307
00:14:27,885 --> 00:14:29,780
Okay. So

308
00:14:29,804 --> 00:14:33,391
we've gotta get our hands on that camera.
Do you know where he installed it?

309
00:14:33,891 --> 00:14:35,953
Sort of.

310
00:14:35,977 --> 00:14:39,063
We all helped him put it up in
this huge tree near the river.

311
00:14:39,897 --> 00:14:43,151
Holmsey, we have a lead.

312
00:14:44,611 --> 00:14:46,964
- cell phone clicks
- typing

313
00:14:46,988 --> 00:14:49,883
- whispers What are you doing?
- I'm on the phone.

314
00:14:49,907 --> 00:14:52,636
Eric, hi. It's Daisy.

315
00:14:52,660 --> 00:14:54,305
Yes, that's... that's
actually why I'm calling.

316
00:14:54,329 --> 00:14:56,807
I really, really need
the afternoon off.

317
00:14:56,831 --> 00:14:59,810
I'm pretty sure that I have...

318
00:14:59,834 --> 00:15:03,463
quietly What's a highly
contagious stomach bug?

319
00:15:04,297 --> 00:15:05,441
Norovirus.

320
00:15:05,465 --> 00:15:06,859
in normal voice
Definitely Norovirus.

321
00:15:06,883 --> 00:15:08,861
100% it's Norovirus.

322
00:15:08,885 --> 00:15:11,763
It feels like Norovirus.

323
00:15:13,389 --> 00:15:14,491
"Fig in Leather"
instrumental playing

324
00:15:14,515 --> 00:15:16,493
Thank you. Okay.

325
00:15:16,517 --> 00:15:17,894
- Bye.
- cell phone clicks

326
00:15:20,313 --> 00:15:22,065
Do you still have that canoe?

327
00:15:33,910 --> 00:15:36,388
This water has to
be like, 50% urine.

328
00:15:36,412 --> 00:15:38,081
That's the good half.

329
00:15:42,502 --> 00:15:43,771
Kidding.

330
00:15:43,795 --> 00:15:45,713
Aza This water is
teeming with bacteria.

331
00:15:47,632 --> 00:15:49,068
Daisy What a day!

332
00:15:49,092 --> 00:15:54,782
The sun's a-shining,
the canoe's a-floating,

333
00:15:54,806 --> 00:15:57,618
and we're about to live
the American dream.

334
00:15:57,642 --> 00:16:01,455
Benefiting from someone
else's misfortune.

335
00:16:01,479 --> 00:16:04,166
Could you please row a little
gentler, so I don't get splashed?

336
00:16:04,190 --> 00:16:05,400
Sorry.

337
00:16:06,150 --> 00:16:07,336
static crackles

338
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:09,004
Aza The water will get on you,

339
00:16:09,028 --> 00:16:10,714
and then it's only a
matter of time before...

340
00:16:10,738 --> 00:16:12,549
Hey, did you know that this
river is the only reason

341
00:16:12,573 --> 00:16:14,218
that Indianapolis even exists?

342
00:16:14,242 --> 00:16:16,470
I know you're trying
to distract me.

343
00:16:16,494 --> 00:16:19,431
Yep, but did you know my thing?

344
00:16:19,455 --> 00:16:22,142
Aza Bacteria can
lead to Giardia.

345
00:16:22,166 --> 00:16:26,230
So, back when Indiana
first became a state,

346
00:16:26,254 --> 00:16:29,775
there were all of these heated debates
about where the capital should be.

347
00:16:29,799 --> 00:16:33,904
And they noticed that there's a river
right smack in the center of the state.

348
00:16:33,928 --> 00:16:38,117
So, they're like, "Boomshakalaka,

00:16:38,141 --> 00:16:40,661
But then, after they
made the announcement,

350
00:16:40,685 --> 00:16:44,164
they realized that the White
River is, like, six inches deep,

351
00:16:44,188 --> 00:16:47,567

can float a steamship down it.

For a long time,

353

largest city in the world

00:16:54,031 --> 00:16:55,801

really interesting.

356
00:16:55,825 --> 00:16:57,660
Yeah, I knew you'd like that.

357
00:16:59,579 --> 00:17:01,748
And look at that, we're here!

358
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:04,101

00:17:12,091 --> 00:17:13,092
Nah.

363
00:17:16,387 --> 00:17:18,657
It's plausible deniability.

364
00:17:18,681 --> 00:17:21,392
Now... sighs which way
to that camera, Holmsey?

365
00:17:22,727 --> 00:17:24,228

Maybe you could take us to him.

432
00:20:21,072 --> 00:20:22,490
It would be my pleasure.

433
00:20:23,741 --> 00:20:24,741
Oh.

knew each other.

448

washed ashore on your... mansion.

449
00:21:19,463 --> 00:21:21,966
Uh, apologies for the intrusion.

450

Uh, well, I'm gonna...
I think I'm gonna...

451
00:21:28,097 --> 00:21:29,950
I'm gonna go make a phone call.

452
00:21:29,974 --> 00:21:33,203

have that canoe insurance

453

460
00:21:51,704 --> 00:21:53,765
You were?

461
00:21:53,789 --> 00:21:56,518
Yeah, everyone on the news
keeps using my dad's full name,

462
00:21:56,542 --> 00:21:57,769
Russell Davis Pickett.

463
00:21:57,793 --> 00:22:00,713
And I keep thinking,
"That's my name."

464
00:22:02,506 --> 00:22:04,192
That made you think of me?

465
00:22:04,216 --> 00:22:05,986
I remember you said that
your dad wanted you to have

466
00:22:06,010 --> 00:22:07,904
your own unique name.

467
00:22:07,928 --> 00:22:09,555
A sound you could make your own.

468
00:22:10,347 --> 00:22:12,659

469
00:22:12,683 --> 00:22:14,351

471
00:22:18,189 --> 00:22:21,317

about everything.

473
00:22:29,033 --> 00:22:30,951

00:25:04,939 --> 00:25:06,958
I'm not...

526
00:25:06,982 --> 00:25:09,169
I can't date anyone,
you know that.

527
00:25:09,193 --> 00:25:12,589
No, I don't know
that. Why can't you?

528
00:25:12,613 --> 00:25:16,551
Maybe because the actual mechanics
of it don't suit my talents?

529
00:25:16,575 --> 00:25:17,969
The...

530
00:25:17,993 --> 00:25:21,580
Like, swapping bodily
fluids is my idea of hell.

531
00:25:23,123 --> 00:25:24,643
And also, when you date people,

532
00:25:24,667 --> 00:25:26,603
they say stuff like,
"What are you thinking?"

533
00:25:26,627 --> 00:25:30,398
And you're supposed to say, "I'm
thinking about you, darling."

534
00:25:30,422 --> 00:25:33,235
But you're actually thinking about
how cows literally could not survive

535
00:25:33,259 --> 00:25:35,237
without the microbiota
in their guts.

536
00:25:35,261 --> 00:25:38,782
Which means, cows sort of don't
exist as independent life forms,

537
00:25:38,806 --> 00:25:40,742
but you can't say that
because it'll seem weird.

538
00:25:40,766 --> 00:25:44,788
So, you're forced to choose
between lying and seeming weird.

539
00:25:44,812 --> 00:25:49,709
I mean, I think that's a great icebreaker
for your future date with Davis.

540
00:25:49,733 --> 00:25:50,985
both chuckle

541
00:25:52,069 --> 00:25:53,588
I'm...

542
00:25:53,612 --> 00:25:56,532
Look, it is definitely weird,
but in the best kind of way.

543
00:25:57,741 --> 00:25:58,993
Like you, Holmsey.

544
00:26:01,078 --> 00:26:03,598
You know what? I bet that
if you guys actually kissed,

545
00:26:03,622 --> 00:26:05,350
you would not be
thinking about...

546
00:26:05,374 --> 00:26:07,084
Eighty million microbes.

547
00:26:07,584 --> 00:26:09,396
Ooh.

548
00:26:09,420 --> 00:26:11,588
What if his microbes
are better than yours?

549
00:26:13,215 --> 00:26:14,776
Right?

550
00:26:14,800 --> 00:26:18,238
Like, maybe if you guys made
out, you'd get healthier.

551
00:26:18,262 --> 00:26:20,115
snorting Maybe.

552
00:26:20,139 --> 00:26:23,868
gasps What if you got
superpowers from his microbes?

553
00:26:23,892 --> 00:26:25,578
Yes. Oh, my God.

554
00:26:25,602 --> 00:26:29,165
"She was a normal girl until
she kissed a billionaire,

555
00:26:29,189 --> 00:26:32,460
and then she became
'Micro Bianca...

556
00:26:32,484 --> 00:26:34,087
- Queen of the Microbe!'"
- Shh! Stop! Stop!

557
00:26:34,111 --> 00:26:36,238
Daisy snoring

558
00:27:15,652 --> 00:27:17,213
Davis "The greatest
weapon against stress is

559
00:27:17,237 --> 00:27:19,341
our ability to choose one
thought over another."

560
00:27:19,365 --> 00:27:20,842
somber instrumental
music playing

561
00:27:20,866 --> 00:27:23,303
William James.

562
00:27:23,327 --> 00:27:26,097
What superpower did William
James have? chuckles

563
00:27:26,121 --> 00:27:28,832
I can't choose my thoughts
like I can't choose my name.

564
00:27:40,302 --> 00:27:42,072
With everyone snooping
around my family's business,

565
00:27:42,096 --> 00:27:44,491
I think it's time to
shut this account down.

566
00:27:44,515 --> 00:27:47,559
So, this is goodbye, my friends.

567
00:27:49,019 --> 00:27:50,312
Then again, uh,

568
00:27:53,065 --> 00:27:55,818
\an8no one ever says goodbye unless
they want to see you again.

569
00:28:09,998 --> 00:28:11,518
- school bell ringing
- music fades

570
00:28:15,921 --> 00:28:18,066
- Hey, Aza, how's it goin'?
- Aza Hey.

571
00:28:18,090 --> 00:28:21,361
It's good. Uh, what's up?

572
00:28:21,385 --> 00:28:23,738
Listen, I don't wanna
mess up our friend group,

573
00:28:23,762 --> 00:28:27,683
because it's really great and I
don't wanna make anything weird,

574
00:28:29,226 --> 00:28:30,453
but do you think...

575
00:28:30,477 --> 00:28:32,163
And you can... you
can totally tell me no

576
00:28:32,187 --> 00:28:33,832
and I won't be offended
or anything. Chuckles

577
00:28:33,856 --> 00:28:35,333
- Uh...
- But...

578
00:28:35,357 --> 00:28:38,461
I... I don't really think I
can date anyone right now.

579
00:28:38,485 --> 00:28:40,404
Uh, this is awkward.

580
00:28:42,823 --> 00:28:44,092
I was gonna ask chuckles

581
00:28:44,116 --> 00:28:47,470
if you think Daisy would
wanna go out with me

582
00:28:47,494 --> 00:28:48,763
or if that's crazy?

583
00:28:48,787 --> 00:28:50,557
But I mean, you're
great, too, Aza.

584
00:28:50,581 --> 00:28:52,308
- You know...
- Yes, yes, that's... that's a good idea.

585
00:28:52,332 --> 00:28:54,644
I mean, you should
talk to her, not me,

586
00:28:54,668 --> 00:28:56,438
but by all means, go for it.

587
00:28:56,462 --> 00:28:58,398
both chuckle

588
00:28:58,422 --> 00:29:00,733
This is embarrassing. I'm
embarrassed right now.

589
00:29:00,757 --> 00:29:02,735
No, no, no. I mean, you're
beautiful, too, Aza.

590
00:29:02,759 --> 00:29:04,112
It's just, you know,
I've known her since...

591
00:29:04,136 --> 00:29:06,739
Mmm. No. It's good. We're good.

592
00:29:06,763 --> 00:29:08,491
Daisy I guess it makes sense.

593
00:29:08,515 --> 00:29:10,201
He's been pining
over me for months.

594
00:29:10,225 --> 00:29:11,351
Really?

595
00:29:12,644 --> 00:29:13,687
How do you know?

596
00:29:21,695 --> 00:29:23,173
Because I have eyes.

597
00:29:23,197 --> 00:29:24,198
Aza giggles

598
00:29:25,407 --> 00:29:28,160
So, what are you gonna say?

599
00:29:28,869 --> 00:29:30,054
I'm down.

600
00:29:30,078 --> 00:29:32,599
Figure one date can't hurt.

601
00:29:32,623 --> 00:29:34,726
And now, me and Mychal can
go out with you and Davis.

602
00:29:34,750 --> 00:29:36,936
We'll all wind up
back at the castle,

603
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:39,922
I'll sneak off and snoop
around while you and Davis...

604
00:29:41,215 --> 00:29:43,818
Boom-diddy-boom-boom.

605
00:29:43,842 --> 00:29:44,986
Hey.

606
00:29:45,010 --> 00:29:46,094
What is...

607
00:29:46,762 --> 00:29:47,971
It's porn music.

608
00:29:49,097 --> 00:29:50,783
Okay.

609
00:29:50,807 --> 00:29:55,455
Even if I agree to go along with
this, Davis didn't ask me out.

610
00:29:55,479 --> 00:29:58,750
Aza, you don't have to wait
for a boy to ask you out.

611
00:29:58,774 --> 00:30:00,627
What are you, a handmaiden?

612
00:30:00,651 --> 00:30:02,587
Just text him. Tell him that
some friends are getting together

613
00:30:02,611 --> 00:30:04,464
for burgers this weekend.

614
00:30:04,488 --> 00:30:07,175
Trust me, he's going to say yes.

615
00:30:07,199 --> 00:30:09,701
- We're texting him now.
- sighs

616
00:30:11,495 --> 00:30:12,555
typing

617
00:30:12,579 --> 00:30:13,598
7:00?

618
00:30:13,622 --> 00:30:16,059
- 7:00 work?
- Yeah, sure.

619
00:30:16,083 --> 00:30:17,644
P.M.? Or do you think
he knows that it's...

620
00:30:17,668 --> 00:30:19,395
I mean, it's not like breakfast.

621
00:30:19,419 --> 00:30:20,897
typing

622
00:30:20,921 --> 00:30:22,089
Okay.

623
00:30:24,383 --> 00:30:25,902
Breezy, very breezy.

624
00:30:25,926 --> 00:30:26,926
message whooshes

625
00:30:31,348 --> 00:30:32,641
cell phone dinging, vibrating

626
00:30:42,025 --> 00:30:44,337
- Did he answer really fast?
- Yeah.

627
00:30:44,361 --> 00:30:47,465
- What do we wear?
- Evening gowns. Duh.

628
00:30:47,489 --> 00:30:49,759
funky instrumental
music playing

629
00:30:49,783 --> 00:30:50,783
sighs

630
00:30:57,499 --> 00:30:59,376
Hey, have you ever
gotten a dick pic?

631
00:31:02,629 --> 00:31:03,629
Uh...

632
00:31:04,590 --> 00:31:08,361
I mean, I've seen one.

633
00:31:08,385 --> 00:31:10,321
Of course you've seen one.

634
00:31:10,345 --> 00:31:15,451
I'm asking if you've ever received
a dick pic totally unsolicited.

635
00:31:15,475 --> 00:31:17,829
- Like, as a form of introduction.
- Oh.

636
00:31:17,853 --> 00:31:23,585
Like, "Hey, nice to
meet you. I'm a penis."

637
00:31:23,609 --> 00:31:24,794
Uh-huh.

638
00:31:24,818 --> 00:31:27,839
Yeah, no. I haven't.

639
00:31:27,863 --> 00:31:28,863
Daisy sighs

640
00:31:30,741 --> 00:31:33,619
A fan literally sent me one.

641
00:31:35,912 --> 00:31:38,516
It's just like, what is the
thought process? You know?

642
00:31:38,540 --> 00:31:40,518
"I really enjoyed
this story you wrote

643
00:31:40,542 --> 00:31:42,979
about Rey and Chewbacca's
romantic adventure

644
00:31:43,003 --> 00:31:44,480
- scavenging a Tul'kar's spaceship."
- sighs

645
00:31:44,504 --> 00:31:46,316
"So, as a thank
you to the author,

646
00:31:46,340 --> 00:31:48,776
here's a photograph of my
disembodied, flaccid penis."

647
00:31:48,800 --> 00:31:49,861
- door opens
- gasps

648
00:31:49,885 --> 00:31:51,511
- music stops
- Hi, guys.

649
00:31:52,054 --> 00:31:53,031
Hey.

650
00:31:53,055 --> 00:31:54,907
What are you lookin' at?

651
00:31:54,931 --> 00:31:56,743
- Social media.
- We're just... Social media.

652
00:31:56,767 --> 00:31:59,144
- Social media platforms.
- Social media. Social media.

653
00:32:04,232 --> 00:32:06,836
Did they change the
dress code at Applebee's?

654
00:32:06,860 --> 00:32:08,129
Aza Hilarious.

655
00:32:08,153 --> 00:32:10,673
- We're going on a double date.
- Daisy.

656
00:32:10,697 --> 00:32:12,699
What? It's not a secret.

657
00:32:13,492 --> 00:32:15,011
Shit, was it a secret?

658
00:32:15,035 --> 00:32:16,370
With who?

659
00:32:17,496 --> 00:32:20,767
- Mychal and Davis.
- Davis Pickett?

660
00:32:20,791 --> 00:32:23,186
Yep. Okay, bye, Mom.

661
00:32:23,210 --> 00:32:25,188
Okay, okay.

662
00:32:25,212 --> 00:32:27,464
You look beautiful.
I love the lipstick.

663
00:32:28,840 --> 00:32:30,008
- door closes
- Ooh.

664
00:32:31,802 --> 00:32:33,821
Lose the lipstick.

665
00:32:33,845 --> 00:32:35,865
door opens - whimsical
song playing on speakers

666
00:32:35,889 --> 00:32:37,241
- Daisy Hi, guys.
- Hey, what's goin' on?

667
00:32:37,265 --> 00:32:38,409
- Hey.
- Daisy Hey.

668
00:32:38,433 --> 00:32:39,810
- Hi.
- Mychal How are you?

669
00:32:40,519 --> 00:32:41,746
Hi.

670
00:32:41,770 --> 00:32:43,539
Ooh. Not yet. Giggles

671
00:32:43,563 --> 00:32:46,292
- You guys come here a lot?
- Mychal Bro, they're regulars.

672
00:32:46,316 --> 00:32:48,878
Where else can you get a
shrimp wonton, a chicken parm,

673
00:32:48,902 --> 00:32:50,838
and a quesadilla
in one fell swoop?

674
00:32:50,862 --> 00:32:53,383
all laughing

675
00:32:53,407 --> 00:32:55,093
Can we get a round of
Dr Peppers, please?

676
00:32:55,117 --> 00:32:57,637
Oh, Davis, Davis, Davis,
soft drinks aren't covered

677
00:32:57,661 --> 00:32:59,413
- by the coupon.
- I think we can splurge.

678
00:33:00,706 --> 00:33:02,433
That's your favorite, right?

679
00:33:02,457 --> 00:33:03,750
Do you remember that?

680
00:33:05,168 --> 00:33:06,378
chuckles

681
00:33:10,465 --> 00:33:12,902
So, uh, Mychal just submitted
one of his portraits

682
00:33:12,926 --> 00:33:15,988
to be in this big pop-up art show
they're doing in these abandoned tunnels.

683
00:33:16,012 --> 00:33:17,573
Well, that's awesome.

684
00:33:17,597 --> 00:33:18,783
Yeah, I... I don't think I'm
gonna get selected, though.

685
00:33:18,807 --> 00:33:20,493
Daisy You definitely will.

686
00:33:20,517 --> 00:33:22,704
- fading You're so talented...
- static crackling

687
00:33:22,728 --> 00:33:24,872
Aza You're sweating, and
everyone can tell you're sweating.

688
00:33:24,896 --> 00:33:29,085
They probably think you're
just a sweaty freak.

689
00:33:29,109 --> 00:33:31,504
Aza, what's it like to be
friends with a literary icon?

690
00:33:31,528 --> 00:33:35,842
Aw, I don't think 80,000 readers
makes me an icon. Laughs

691
00:33:35,866 --> 00:33:40,722
Besides, Aza has never read my
fanfic. She's not a Star Wars girl.

692
00:33:40,746 --> 00:33:42,265
static crackling

693
00:33:42,289 --> 00:33:44,434
Aza Did you even change
the Band-Aid today?

694
00:33:44,458 --> 00:33:46,144
Yes, I did.

695
00:33:46,168 --> 00:33:47,252
Are you sure?

696
00:33:51,298 --> 00:33:52,298
Right, Holmsey?

697
00:33:53,300 --> 00:33:55,611
Aza Say something. Anything.

698
00:33:55,635 --> 00:33:57,321
- Right. Chuckles
- Yeah.

699
00:33:57,345 --> 00:33:58,823
Mychal Plus y'all both got
other similar interests, right?

700
00:33:58,847 --> 00:34:00,491
- fading Like...
- Yeah.

701
00:34:00,515 --> 00:34:02,118
Aza There's no reason
not to change the Band-Aid.

702
00:34:02,142 --> 00:34:04,120
Just go change it
and be done with it.

703
00:34:04,144 --> 00:34:06,164
Daisy We also really
like Applebee's.

704
00:34:06,188 --> 00:34:07,397
Be right back.

705
00:34:13,403 --> 00:34:15,465
sighs Anyway.

706
00:34:15,489 --> 00:34:17,550
tense music playing

707
00:34:17,574 --> 00:34:19,743
Aza breathing heavily

708
00:34:23,288 --> 00:34:24,183
static crackles

709
00:34:24,207 --> 00:34:26,684
It's infected. You're infected.

710
00:34:26,708 --> 00:34:29,353
Bacteria are multiplying
inside of you right now.

711
00:34:29,377 --> 00:34:31,963
Do something. Do
something. Do something.

712
00:34:37,010 --> 00:34:38,654
- door opens
- tense music stops

713
00:34:38,678 --> 00:34:42,283
Hey, I'm just checking on you.

714
00:34:42,307 --> 00:34:43,367
door closes

715
00:34:43,391 --> 00:34:45,602
Does this look infected to you?

716
00:34:49,606 --> 00:34:53,944
It looks exactly the same as every
other time you've shown it to me.

717
00:34:56,947 --> 00:35:00,343
- He must think I'm really crazy.
- No, he doesn't.

718
00:35:00,367 --> 00:35:02,970
Aza, I swear to God,
he's so smitten,

719
00:35:02,994 --> 00:35:05,515
you could literally start
peeing out of your ears

720
00:35:05,539 --> 00:35:07,082
and he would still be into you.

721
00:35:10,752 --> 00:35:14,607
Look, he invited us all over to hang
out, but if that's too much for you...

722
00:35:14,631 --> 00:35:17,175
No. Let's go.

723
00:35:18,176 --> 00:35:20,613
Okay. Good.

724
00:35:20,637 --> 00:35:23,407
'Cause I'm gonna Nancy Drew
the shit outta that mansion.

725
00:35:23,431 --> 00:35:24,867
both chuckle

726
00:35:24,891 --> 00:35:27,102
upbeat pop music playing

727
00:35:29,771 --> 00:35:35,086
- Okay. Chuckles Welcome.
- Yo, what?

728
00:35:35,110 --> 00:35:39,841
Oh, my God! Yo, bro,
is that a Keith Haring?

729
00:35:39,865 --> 00:35:42,885
echoing Then you got Picasso,
and then you got Basquiat!

730
00:35:42,909 --> 00:35:44,679
Nah. Wait...

731
00:35:44,703 --> 00:35:45,930
- Did I just echo?
- Davis chuckles

732
00:35:45,954 --> 00:35:47,390
Mychal laughing

733
00:35:47,414 --> 00:35:50,726
Bro, that's crazy. Wait,
hold on, hold on. Basquiat.

734
00:35:50,750 --> 00:35:51,978
- Basquiat.
- Davis chuckles

735
00:35:52,002 --> 00:35:53,938
Hey, yo, Basquiat.
Oh, that's tough.

736
00:35:53,962 --> 00:35:56,232
- Okay. Mychal, breathe.
- Ba... Sorry.

737
00:35:56,256 --> 00:35:58,234
- exhales
- Can we show ourselves around?

738
00:35:58,258 --> 00:35:59,342
Daisy!

739
00:36:00,719 --> 00:36:03,197
No, I mean... I... chuckles

740
00:36:03,221 --> 00:36:07,410
Let's be honest, we're all dying to
get some alone time anyway, right?

741
00:36:07,434 --> 00:36:08,953
Davis chuckles

742
00:36:08,977 --> 00:36:11,330
- Yeah, sure. Do whatever.
- Mychal Wait, like, for real?

743
00:36:11,354 --> 00:36:12,915
- Like, we could...
- He said do whatever.

744
00:36:12,939 --> 00:36:14,566
laughs Bet.

745
00:36:16,151 --> 00:36:17,151
Aza chuckles

746
00:36:19,279 --> 00:36:20,655
And what's this one?

747
00:36:27,537 --> 00:36:30,099
It's a Raymond Pettibon.

748
00:36:30,123 --> 00:36:31,809
He's most famous for his
paintings of surfers,

749
00:36:31,833 --> 00:36:33,418
but I like his spirals.

750
00:36:34,628 --> 00:36:36,814
He was a musician
before he was an artist.

751
00:36:36,838 --> 00:36:39,424
He was in Black Flag before
it was even Black Flag.

752
00:36:41,301 --> 00:36:42,636
I love it.

753
00:36:44,971 --> 00:36:46,699
warm sentimental music playing

754
00:36:46,723 --> 00:36:49,118
Davis You don't
talk much, do you?

755
00:36:49,142 --> 00:36:53,831
Aza I can get a
little stuck in my head.

756
00:36:53,855 --> 00:36:55,333
Davis Just say
what you're thinking.

757
00:36:55,357 --> 00:36:56,751
Aza chuckles

758
00:36:56,775 --> 00:37:00,630
That's not something
I normally do.

759
00:37:00,654 --> 00:37:02,906
- Do you really want to know?
- I do.

760
00:37:08,286 --> 00:37:14,286
I was thinking that, deep
down, I'm just an organism

761
00:37:14,584 --> 00:37:17,420
in this vastness.

762
00:37:18,797 --> 00:37:21,943
It kind of terrifies
me that what I think of

763
00:37:21,967 --> 00:37:27,889
as, like, my quote unquote "self"
isn't really under my control.

764
00:37:29,182 --> 00:37:30,182
What do you mean?

765
00:37:31,935 --> 00:37:32,978
There's this parasite.

766
00:37:34,270 --> 00:37:36,624
It only grows in
the eyes of fish,

767
00:37:36,648 --> 00:37:41,754
but the only way it can reproduce,
is inside the stomach of a bird.

768
00:37:41,778 --> 00:37:43,798
Once the parasite
is ready to mate,

769
00:37:43,822 --> 00:37:47,510
the infected fish suddenly starts
swimming to the surface of the water.

770
00:37:47,534 --> 00:37:51,121
The fish are literally trying to
get themselves eaten by a bird.

771
00:37:52,497 --> 00:37:54,791
Eventually, they succeed.

772
00:37:56,876 --> 00:37:59,546
The parasite was in
charge all along.

773
00:38:03,299 --> 00:38:05,510
Sometimes I feel like a fish.

774
00:38:08,138 --> 00:38:09,848
Not in control of my body.

775
00:38:11,474 --> 00:38:13,018
Not in control of my thoughts.

776
00:38:15,437 --> 00:38:17,022
I like the way your brain works.

777
00:38:18,898 --> 00:38:19,899
It hums.

778
00:38:21,568 --> 00:38:22,944
Where'd you learn that?

779
00:38:24,821 --> 00:38:28,592
This philosophy
professor, Lucia Abbott.

780
00:38:28,616 --> 00:38:31,036
I've watched her TED
talk, like, a dozen times.

781
00:38:32,704 --> 00:38:34,456
She teaches at Northwestern.

782
00:38:36,207 --> 00:38:40,938
I have this stupid dream of
going there and taking her class.

783
00:38:40,962 --> 00:38:42,505
Why is that a stupid dream?

784
00:38:44,841 --> 00:38:49,280
chuckling I mean,
it's insanely expensive.

785
00:38:49,304 --> 00:38:52,450
And then there's the whole
living in Chicago part,

786
00:38:52,474 --> 00:38:55,894
which... would be new for me.

787
00:38:57,353 --> 00:38:59,915
New things aren't
exactly my strong suit.

788
00:38:59,939 --> 00:39:03,109
Well, I'm sort of a new thing,

789
00:39:05,695 --> 00:39:07,072
and you're doin' fine with me.

790
00:39:08,448 --> 00:39:09,657
You're old-new.

791
00:39:11,534 --> 00:39:12,869
It's different.

792
00:39:14,370 --> 00:39:15,370
"Old-new."

793
00:39:17,540 --> 00:39:18,583
I like that.

794
00:39:22,087 --> 00:39:26,275
Aza If you kiss him, you'll
get his bacteria in your mouth.

795
00:39:26,299 --> 00:39:28,426
His bacteria will make you sick.

796
00:39:29,803 --> 00:39:31,387
What are you thinking?

797
00:39:35,266 --> 00:39:36,601
You really wanna know?

798
00:39:37,727 --> 00:39:38,853
I do. Laughs

799
00:39:40,897 --> 00:39:41,897
Okay.

800
00:39:42,816 --> 00:39:43,817
I was thinking...

801
00:39:45,693 --> 00:39:47,570
"I hope she's not
after the reward."

802
00:39:51,574 --> 00:39:52,885
Davis, I'm not.

803
00:39:52,909 --> 00:39:54,303
music fades

804
00:39:54,327 --> 00:39:56,347
- I swear.
- Aza.

805
00:39:56,371 --> 00:39:59,475
I know why you guys were
in the woods the other day.

806
00:39:59,499 --> 00:40:01,334
You were looking for
the camera, right?

807
00:40:03,086 --> 00:40:05,314
I checked it, too.

808
00:40:05,338 --> 00:40:07,966
Got a photo of him
leaving with a duffel bag.

809
00:40:10,468 --> 00:40:13,930
I never actually cared
about the reward.

810
00:40:15,473 --> 00:40:16,951
Daisy and I were just...

811
00:40:16,975 --> 00:40:17,975
I just realized

812
00:40:19,936 --> 00:40:21,980
this is an entirely
solvable problem.

813
00:40:22,981 --> 00:40:25,066
funky music playing

814
00:40:27,110 --> 00:40:29,028
plastic rustling

815
00:40:30,488 --> 00:40:31,614
What are you doing?

816
00:40:32,449 --> 00:40:34,510
Davis One second.

817
00:40:34,534 --> 00:40:36,744
- Are you into lizards?
- Hmm?

818
00:40:37,579 --> 00:40:38,889
Oh, no, my dad is.

819
00:40:38,913 --> 00:40:43,042
Although, that is not a
lizard. That's a tuatara.

820
00:40:43,960 --> 00:40:45,396
What is that?

821
00:40:45,420 --> 00:40:49,316
I don't know, some leftover
from 200 million years ago

822
00:40:49,340 --> 00:40:51,759
that my dad believes holds
the secret to longevity.

823
00:40:52,969 --> 00:40:54,280
You can learn all about it

824
00:40:54,304 --> 00:40:56,198
at the Pickett Center
for Tuatara Research,

825
00:40:56,222 --> 00:40:58,826
which is a real thing that he's
leaving most of his estate to.

826
00:40:58,850 --> 00:41:01,412
- That is insane.
- Do you know what's worse?

827
00:41:01,436 --> 00:41:03,914
The money doesn't even go to
taking care of the damn thing.

828
00:41:03,938 --> 00:41:07,334
It pays for studying its cells with
all sorts of horrible experiments.

829
00:41:07,358 --> 00:41:10,004
- footsteps retreating
- drawer opens

830
00:41:10,028 --> 00:41:11,028
box rattles

831
00:41:12,822 --> 00:41:16,284
This is for you.

832
00:41:17,744 --> 00:41:18,744
Oh.

833
00:41:20,663 --> 00:41:21,932
Thank you.

834
00:41:21,956 --> 00:41:23,851
Promise me you won't open
it till you get home.

835
00:41:23,875 --> 00:41:28,063
And if you still wanna
see me, give me a call.

836
00:41:28,087 --> 00:41:32,067
Or a text, or whatever people say
that sounds casual and smooth.

837
00:41:32,091 --> 00:41:33,218
Aza chuckles

838
00:41:34,636 --> 00:41:35,637
Okay.

839
00:41:36,512 --> 00:41:38,324
mellow pop music playing

840
00:41:38,348 --> 00:41:41,059
I should probably go find Daisy.

841
00:41:42,185 --> 00:41:43,394
It's getting late.

842
00:41:45,605 --> 00:41:46,605
Daisy?

843
00:41:50,610 --> 00:41:51,610
Aza sighs

844
00:41:56,824 --> 00:41:57,825
Daisy?

845
00:41:58,952 --> 00:41:59,994
Mychal?

846
00:42:01,371 --> 00:42:02,371
gasps

847
00:42:03,081 --> 00:42:04,123
Davis clears throat

848
00:42:05,291 --> 00:42:06,769
Hey.

849
00:42:06,793 --> 00:42:08,521
Hey, we were just, um...

850
00:42:08,545 --> 00:42:09,813
Mychal clears throat

851
00:42:09,837 --> 00:42:10,940
- Uh, we were, we were...
- Mychal Um

852
00:42:10,964 --> 00:42:12,524
we were looking for you!

853
00:42:12,548 --> 00:42:13,817
- Mmm-hmm. Right.
- chuckles

854
00:42:13,841 --> 00:42:14,860
You weren't in here.

855
00:42:14,884 --> 00:42:16,195
Found us.

856
00:42:16,219 --> 00:42:17,571
both chuckle

857
00:42:17,595 --> 00:42:18,739
- You ready to go?
- Yeah.

858
00:42:18,763 --> 00:42:19,782
- Great.
- Let me see...

859
00:42:19,806 --> 00:42:21,975
mellow pop music continues

860
00:42:26,813 --> 00:42:28,690
lock clicking

861
00:42:39,575 --> 00:42:43,138
Gina Aza, you're home late.

862
00:42:43,162 --> 00:42:46,457
I know. Sorry. Traffic.

863
00:42:50,295 --> 00:42:51,963
music intensifies

864
00:42:58,928 --> 00:42:59,928
gasps

865
00:43:13,443 --> 00:43:15,170
- knocking at door
- gasps

866
00:43:15,194 --> 00:43:19,383
- I want to hear about your date.
- Aza I'm changing.

867
00:43:19,407 --> 00:43:21,826
Good night. Talk to you in
the morning. I love you.

868
00:43:25,163 --> 00:43:27,081
- gasps
- cell phone clicks

869
00:43:35,590 --> 00:43:36,590

870
00:43:41,846 --> 00:43:42,846

00:44:35,983 --> 00:44:38,712
I'm so glad you're here.
Holmsey, I have a lot to say.

882
00:44:38,736 --> 00:44:40,255
Shocker. Listen...

883
00:44:40,279 --> 00:44:42,383
First, I'm sorry to ditch
you last night. Very uncool.

884
00:44:42,407 --> 00:44:43,801
That's totally fine. Daisy...

885
00:44:43,825 --> 00:44:45,344
Second, I know, I know, I know.

886
00:44:45,368 --> 00:44:47,012
I convinced you to come
so that we could snoop,

887
00:44:47,036 --> 00:44:48,639
and then I didn't even snoop.

888
00:44:48,663 --> 00:44:51,225
But Mychal is kind of amazing.

889
00:44:51,249 --> 00:44:53,477
- And I want to hear all about it, but...
- Mmm, mmm.

890
00:44:53,501 --> 00:44:55,104
The first room that
we wandered into

891
00:44:55,128 --> 00:44:58,148
had a fireplace with
a remote control.

892
00:44:58,172 --> 00:45:00,692
And then the next thing I know,
we were cuddled up on this couch

893
00:45:00,716 --> 00:45:02,736
that was also, like,
a literal work of art.

894
00:45:02,760 --> 00:45:06,448
And I don't... One thing led to another
and I just let him, I let him...

895
00:45:06,472 --> 00:45:07,616
Daisy!

Oh, I'm more of a frosted
blueberry kind of girl.

899
00:45:16,691 --> 00:45:18,234
Just look inside.

What in the shit is this?

904
00:45:32,206 --> 00:45:33,976
Davis gave it to me.

905
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:36,937
I'm not sure if it really makes
sense, or if it's ethical. I don't...

906
00:45:36,961 --> 00:45:38,605
Oh, no, no, no.

907
00:45:38,629 --> 00:45:43,735
For once in your life,
Aza, do not overthink this.

908
00:45:43,759 --> 00:45:45,154
Oh.

909
00:45:45,178 --> 00:45:47,531
Should I have not come here
to tell you you're rich?

910
00:45:47,555 --> 00:45:49,825
It's okay, I can just
hold on to your half.

911
00:45:49,849 --> 00:45:50,850
Wait!

912
00:45:52,143 --> 00:45:54,329
Half of this is mine?

913
00:45:54,353 --> 00:45:56,814
There's 50 grand for each of us.

916
00:46:04,864 --> 00:46:07,551
Do you actually
think we can keep it?

917
00:46:07,575 --> 00:46:09,970
Hell yes, we can keep it!

918
00:46:09,994 --> 00:46:12,890
Holmsey, I am so
done with the idea

919
00:46:12,914 --> 00:46:16,935
that there is, like, nobility
in turning down money.

920
00:46:16,959 --> 00:46:19,021
This is gonna change our lives.

921
00:46:19,045 --> 00:46:22,191
I'm actually gonna go to
college. Not at night.

922
00:46:22,215 --> 00:46:24,234
Well, it's not enough to
pay for all of college.

923
00:46:24,258 --> 00:46:26,778
sighs Yeah, I know
that, Queen Buzzkill.

924
00:46:26,802 --> 00:46:30,199
But it'll make paying for
college a hell of a lot easier.

925
00:46:30,223 --> 00:46:33,351
Aza, you can put this
towards Northwestern.

926
00:46:35,728 --> 00:46:37,372
My mom can't know
about this money.

927
00:46:37,396 --> 00:46:39,750
Duh, my parents would make
me split it with my sister.

928
00:46:39,774 --> 00:46:43,337
No. No. No!

929
00:46:43,361 --> 00:46:49,051
Now, I need you to just
accept that the universe

930
00:46:49,075 --> 00:46:51,827
is being awesome
with us right now

931
00:46:53,079 --> 00:46:54,580

932
00:46:58,334 --> 00:46:59,811

- Ooh.

Uh, I will get my usual
blazin' Texan burger,

942
00:47:25,611 --> 00:47:28,257
but I would like to upgrade
my side to onion rings.

943
00:47:28,281 --> 00:47:30,384
And, yes, I know
that it's extra.

944
00:47:30,408 --> 00:47:33,053
- Holly And you?
- A veggie burger.

945
00:47:33,077 --> 00:47:36,139
Uh, no tomatoes, cheese,
mayonnaise, onions...

946
00:47:36,163 --> 00:47:37,623
Yeah, I know your order.

947
00:47:39,333 --> 00:47:42,229

- laughing No.

948
00:47:42,253 --> 00:47:45,339

956
00:48:11,240 --> 00:48:13,618
I thought we were saving
the money for college.

957
00:48:14,452 --> 00:48:16,722
We are. Most of it.

958
00:48:16,746 --> 00:48:20,559
But I talked the car salesman
down to $8,400 from $10,000,

959
00:48:20,583 --> 00:48:21,935
so in a way, I made money.

960
00:48:21,959 --> 00:48:24,896
In no way did you
make any money.

961
00:48:24,920 --> 00:48:26,815
But you already had a car.

962
00:48:26,839 --> 00:48:29,383

- Okay.

This is Evan, my friend

1004
00:50:38,387 --> 00:50:39,865
Um, you must be Aza.

1005
00:50:39,889 --> 00:50:42,325
I've heard such great
things about you.

1006
00:50:42,349 --> 00:50:44,327
Evan is a contractor.

1007
00:50:44,351 --> 00:50:47,164
He came by after work to see if we
could turn the garage into a bedroom.

1008
00:50:47,188 --> 00:50:50,834
Why do we need a new bedroom?
We never have any guests.

1009
00:50:50,858 --> 00:50:54,004
Actually, I was thinking
maybe you'd like it.

1010
00:50:54,028 --> 00:50:58,324
- For the future.
- Like, when I'm in college?

1011
00:51:00,576 --> 00:51:02,304
I'll get out of you guys' way.

1013
00:51:03,454 --> 00:51:05,289
It's nice to finally
meet you, Aza.

1014
00:51:06,415 --> 00:51:08,000
- I'll see you later.
- Thank you.

1015
00:51:10,503 --> 00:51:11,504
Bye.

1016
00:51:15,382 --> 00:51:17,944
- You want me to live in the garage?
- No.

1017
00:51:17,968 --> 00:51:20,322
I mean, yes, but it
wouldn't be a garage.

1018
00:51:20,346 --> 00:51:23,015
We'd make it into more
of your own apartment.

scoffs

1020
00:51:26,185 --> 00:51:28,604
So, you think I'm too crazy
to live away from home?

1021
00:51:29,730 --> 00:51:31,583
Aza, it was just an idea.

1022
00:51:31,607 --> 00:51:33,418
I was trying to get
a sense of the costs.

1023
00:51:33,442 --> 00:51:36,463
And IU is close by and
it's such a good school...

1024
00:51:36,487 --> 00:51:37,696
Got it.

1025
00:51:39,490 --> 00:51:42,409
I'm going over to Davis'

at camp, sitting at the lake.

00:52:01,929 --> 00:52:03,472
You see that bright
star up there?

1030
00:52:04,807 --> 00:52:06,350
The one kind of by itself.

1031
00:52:07,601 --> 00:52:09,478
Yeah, I think so.

1032
00:52:12,064 --> 00:52:13,482
Well, that's Tau Ceti.

1033
00:52:14,817 --> 00:52:16,211
It's 12 light-years away,

1034
00:52:16,235 --> 00:52:18,797
and two of its planets
might actually be habitable.

1035
00:52:18,821 --> 00:52:21,365
- Well, probably not, but maybe.
- chuckles

1036
00:52:23,158 --> 00:52:24,451
It's my favorite star.

1037
00:52:26,370 --> 00:52:27,621
Why is that?

1038
00:52:30,040 --> 00:52:31,601
I like to look at it

1039
00:52:31,625 --> 00:52:32,853
and think about how the
Sun's light looks to someone

1040
00:52:32,877 --> 00:52:35,063
in Tau Ceti's solar system.

1041
00:52:35,087 --> 00:52:38,173
And right now, they're looking
at our light from 12 years ago.

1042
00:52:40,676 --> 00:52:44,847
In the light they see, my
mom has five years to live.

1043
00:52:47,266 --> 00:52:49,476
In the light they see,
you and I are just kids.

1044
00:52:54,023 --> 00:52:55,941
In the light they see,

1045
00:52:57,943 --> 00:53:01,548
my dad just got me
my first tricycle.

1046
00:53:01,572 --> 00:53:06,428
We go to the park,
he watches me ride,

1047
00:53:06,452 --> 00:53:09,997
and he tells me I'm going so
fast, he can barely see me.

1048
00:53:16,587 --> 00:53:17,588
In the light they see,

1049
00:53:20,382 --> 00:53:22,885
we have the best and worst
of it in front of us.

1050
00:53:26,889 --> 00:53:29,600
Hey, how come it's so easy
for me to talk to you?

1051
00:53:32,144 --> 00:53:33,395
I don't know.

1052
00:53:36,398 --> 00:53:40,694
Maybe because our hearts are
broken in the same places.

1053
00:53:46,241 --> 00:53:47,409
chuckles

1054
00:53:53,457 --> 00:53:55,602
You wanna go for a swim?

1055
00:53:55,626 --> 00:53:57,395
mellow romantic music playing

1056
00:53:57,419 --> 00:53:59,088
both chuckle

1057
00:54:06,053 --> 00:54:08,722
- Turn around.
- chuckles Okay.

1058
00:54:30,202 --> 00:54:31,704
Okay, you can look now.

1059
00:54:37,918 --> 00:54:38,961
laughs softly

1060
00:54:49,221 --> 00:54:50,222
Hi.

1061
00:54:52,266 --> 00:54:54,035
Hi.

1062
00:54:54,059 --> 00:54:56,729
Do you have any big exams
or anything Wednesday?

1063
00:54:58,814 --> 00:54:59,815
No.

1064
00:55:00,941 --> 00:55:02,544
Why?

1065
00:55:02,568 --> 00:55:05,571
I was kind of hoping I could
convince you to skip school.

1066
00:55:07,156 --> 00:55:08,323
I wanna take you somewhere.

1067
00:55:09,408 --> 00:55:10,409
Where?

1068
00:55:12,828 --> 00:55:14,055
It's a surprise.

1069
00:55:14,079 --> 00:55:15,372
inhales

1070
00:55:15,956 --> 00:55:17,058
laughs

1071
00:55:17,082 --> 00:55:18,667
music turns funky

1072
00:55:20,586 --> 00:55:21,879
cell phone vibrates

cell phone clicks

1078
00:56:51,635 --> 00:56:54,405
Aza He's cute and smart.

1079
00:56:54,429 --> 00:56:57,492
And not just because he
goes to a fancy prep school.

1080
00:56:57,516 --> 00:56:59,327
music fades

1081
00:56:59,351 --> 00:57:02,914
He makes me feel like I'm an
acceptable girl to have a crush on.

1082
00:57:02,938 --> 00:57:06,167
And you don't feel that
way about yourself?

1083
00:57:06,191 --> 00:57:10,255
I mean, I'm still crazy, if
that's what you're asking.

1084
00:57:10,279 --> 00:57:12,924
Nothing's changed
on the crazy front.

1085
00:57:12,948 --> 00:57:16,010
I would like to ask you to
frame your mental health

1086
00:57:16,034 --> 00:57:18,138
around a word
other than "crazy."

1087
00:57:18,162 --> 00:57:20,515
Um, can we try "courageous"?

1088
00:57:20,539 --> 00:57:23,893
scoffs God, that's
such a psychiatrist move.

1089
00:57:23,917 --> 00:57:26,896
chuckles Look, Aza, plenty of
people with anxiety disorders

1090
00:57:26,920 --> 00:57:30,024
have fulfilling
romantic relationships.

1091
00:57:30,048 --> 00:57:34,070
Yeah, but how can I have a boyfriend
if I hate the idea of kissing him?

1092
00:57:34,094 --> 00:57:38,825
Being intimate with another person
is intimidating for everyone,

1093
00:57:38,849 --> 00:57:42,477
especially for someone who has
already lost someone she loves.

1094
00:57:46,064 --> 00:57:47,064
exhales

1095
00:57:47,983 --> 00:57:49,294
What?

1096
00:57:49,318 --> 00:57:51,778
You don't have to make
this about my dad dying.

1097
00:57:53,739 --> 00:57:56,217
Not everything is about him.

1098
00:57:56,241 --> 00:58:00,221
But you being afraid to
get close to this boy,

1099
00:58:00,245 --> 00:58:02,456
I think it may be a
little bit about him.

1100
00:58:06,835 --> 00:58:08,921
He was better with
me than my mom.

1101
00:58:10,505 --> 00:58:12,507
He never made me feel broken.

1102
00:58:14,635 --> 00:58:15,844
He'd just tell me,

1103
00:58:18,889 --> 00:58:19,973
"You're right to worry.

1104
00:58:22,643 --> 00:58:24,537
Life is worrisome."

1105
00:58:24,561 --> 00:58:26,772
melancholy piano music playing

1106
00:58:29,191 --> 00:58:32,712
Uh, can we go back to talking
about the cute boy again, please?

1107
00:58:32,736 --> 00:58:34,446
inhales sharply

1108
00:58:36,114 --> 00:58:38,301
Aza, I have to be
honest with you.

1109
00:58:38,325 --> 00:58:40,762
I think your progress
is being slowed down

1110
00:58:40,786 --> 00:58:45,558
by your refusal to take the
medication on a regular basis.

1111
00:58:45,582 --> 00:58:48,269
And I believe your chances
of having a relationship

1112
00:58:48,293 --> 00:58:51,922
with this cute, smart
boy will be hurt, too.

1113
00:58:53,090 --> 00:58:54,591
I just think it's messed up.

1114
00:58:56,551 --> 00:58:59,364
The idea of having to take a
pill to become your real self.

1115
00:58:59,388 --> 00:59:02,700
And here I thought you said you'd kill
to have a mind that lets go of things.

1116
00:59:02,724 --> 00:59:06,436
And you said my mind
is what makes me, me.

1117
00:59:08,188 --> 00:59:10,023
But it isn't my
mind on the pills.

1118
00:59:10,774 --> 00:59:11,942
Aza scoffs

1119
00:59:14,611 --> 00:59:16,822
It's a real catch-22, isn't it?

1120
00:59:17,990 --> 00:59:19,133
doorbell rings

1121
00:59:19,157 --> 00:59:20,717

Someone's at the door.

1122
00:59:25,205 --> 00:59:26,205

1123
00:59:27,499 --> 00:59:28,768
Aza Hey.

1124
00:59:28,792 --> 00:59:31,521
I'm, uh, here to hang
out with your brother.

1125
00:59:31,545 --> 00:59:32,981
Oh, yeah, I know.

1126
00:59:33,005 --> 00:59:34,816
He's been trying on different
outfits all morning.

1127
00:59:34,840 --> 00:59:37,318
Hey, Davis. Your
girlfriend's here.

1128
00:59:37,342 --> 00:59:40,095
- Oh, I'm... I'm not his girlfriend.
- Sure.

1129
00:59:41,763 --> 00:59:43,199
Hey, can I show you something?

1130
00:59:43,223 --> 00:59:44,909
mellow curious music playing

1131
00:59:44,933 --> 00:59:47,829
Davis said you and your friend
were trying to find my dad.

1132
00:59:47,853 --> 00:59:50,540
Oh, uh, no. Not really.

1133
00:59:50,564 --> 00:59:53,775
- Um, I mean, I...
- Uh, just check this out.

1134
00:59:58,280 --> 01:00:01,158
- A permission slip?
- Uh, look at the back.

1135
01:00:02,868 --> 01:00:05,179
\an8That's his handwriting.

1136
01:00:05,203 --> 01:00:08,725
\an8Aza "Maldives,
Kosovo, Cambodia.

1137
01:00:08,749 --> 01:00:10,601
The Joggers Mouth"?

1138
01:00:10,625 --> 01:00:14,230
So, Davis says those first three
are countries where people hide out

1139
01:00:14,254 --> 01:00:17,025
when they're wanted in America.

1140
01:00:17,049 --> 01:00:20,028
But I can't figure
out The Joggers Mouth.

1141
01:00:20,052 --> 01:00:21,803
Does it mean anything to you?

1142
01:00:23,388 --> 01:00:24,407
Uh...

1143
01:00:24,431 --> 01:00:25,515
No.

1144
01:00:26,767 --> 01:00:28,226
I'm really sorry, Noah.

1145
01:00:28,977 --> 01:00:30,538

1146
01:00:30,562 --> 01:00:31,539

1147
01:00:31,563 --> 01:00:33,374
Okay.

1148
01:00:33,398 --> 01:00:35,752
Hi. Sorry to keep you waiting.

1149
01:00:35,776 --> 01:00:37,420
Um, I was thinking
really hard about

1150
01:00:37,444 --> 01:00:39,464
whether I can pull this
sweater off or not. Chuckles

1151
01:00:39,488 --> 01:00:41,031
- I like it.
- No, you can't.

1152
01:00:42,741 --> 01:00:43,784
You ready to go?

1153
01:00:48,413 --> 01:00:51,809
- You have your own airplane?
- No, my father does.

1154
01:00:51,833 --> 01:00:55,021
But my father's not here, so...

1155
01:00:55,045 --> 01:00:59,067
- And you have a full-time pilot, too?
- You're looking at him.

1156
01:00:59,091 --> 01:01:01,134
You can get your pilot's
license at 16, so...

1157
01:01:02,636 --> 01:01:03,637
Voila.

1158
01:01:06,556 --> 01:01:07,368

1159

Abbott is right there.

01:03:00,128 --> 01:03:02,398
Okay.

crack free will, shall we?

1206
01:03:07,802 --> 01:03:09,888
You, eating Doritos.

1207
01:03:10,889 --> 01:03:11,890
Why?

1208
01:03:13,141 --> 01:03:14,368
Why?

1209
01:03:14,392 --> 01:03:16,037
Professor Abbott Is it
because you were hungry

1210
01:03:16,061 --> 01:03:17,872
and you made that choice?

1211
01:03:17,896 --> 01:03:20,458
Is it because advertising works?

1212
01:03:20,482 --> 01:03:22,877
students laughing

1213
01:03:22,901 --> 01:03:25,588
Is it because there was only
ever going to be one world,

1214
01:03:25,612 --> 01:03:27,757
and everything was
predetermined from the start,

1215
01:03:27,781 --> 01:03:29,967
and you were always
gonna take this class?

1216
01:03:29,991 --> 01:03:32,220
Well, in our reading,
there was that part

1217
01:03:32,244 --> 01:03:34,597
where Kant said, "Freedom of
the will must be presupposed."

1218
01:03:34,621 --> 01:03:39,143
So, I suppose I could've chosen
any food, but I chose Doritos.

1219
01:03:39,167 --> 01:03:41,062
You did the reading.
Wonderful news.

1220
01:03:41,086 --> 01:03:43,231
students laughing

1221
01:03:43,255 --> 01:03:47,902
And if we just assume that Kant was right,
maybe we don't need the full 90 minutes.

1222
01:03:47,926 --> 01:03:51,030
But Kant was writing about this
in the 18th century, right?

1223
01:03:51,054 --> 01:03:54,951
And now we have all these
fancy brain contraptions.

1224
01:03:54,975 --> 01:03:59,038
In 2008, volunteers were asked
to choose to push a button

1225
01:03:59,062 --> 01:04:02,542
with either their right
hand or their left hand.

1226
01:04:02,566 --> 01:04:07,171
And the researchers found that they
could predict with 100% accuracy

1227
01:04:07,195 --> 01:04:09,006
which choice the
people would make

1228
01:04:09,030 --> 01:04:11,259
seven seconds before the
person believed they'd made it.

1229
01:04:11,283 --> 01:04:13,636
mellow music playing

1230
01:04:13,660 --> 01:04:16,055
So, I ask you again.

1231
01:04:16,079 --> 01:04:18,766
When did you decide
to eat Doritos?

1232
01:04:18,790 --> 01:04:20,625
And who made that choice?

1233
01:04:21,668 --> 01:04:22,812
I have no idea.

1234
01:04:22,836 --> 01:04:24,772
students laughing

1235
01:04:24,796 --> 01:04:26,774
Professor Abbott It's
difficult to define these terms.

1236
01:04:26,798 --> 01:04:28,859
- I need to take this class.
- Professor Abbott What constitutes

1237
01:04:28,883 --> 01:04:31,862
freedom of choice in a world where
our choices are endlessly limited

1238
01:04:31,886 --> 01:04:33,948
and shaped by cultural forces?

1239
01:04:33,972 --> 01:04:37,535
I mean, she has a way of taking these
old, dusty philosophical questions

1240
01:04:37,559 --> 01:04:40,162
and making them feel
so insanely relevant.

1241
01:04:40,186 --> 01:04:41,438
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

1242
01:04:45,358 --> 01:04:46,359
Okay.

1243
01:04:49,321 --> 01:04:50,363
Why are we hiding?

1244
01:04:53,158 --> 01:04:54,659
Because she's right there.

1245
01:04:55,994 --> 01:04:57,471
Davis You should
go talk to her.

1246
01:04:57,495 --> 01:04:59,372
- What would I even say?
- Aza.

1247
01:05:00,498 --> 01:05:01,583
You got this.

1248
01:05:11,926 --> 01:05:13,511
Aza Hi, Professor Abbott.

1249
01:05:15,096 --> 01:05:17,450
I wanted to introduce myself.

1250
01:05:17,474 --> 01:05:19,643
I'm Aza Holmes, and I'm

1251
01:05:21,853 --> 01:05:23,122
a fan.

1252
01:05:23,146 --> 01:05:25,625
Are you a fan of
being my student?

1253
01:05:25,649 --> 01:05:29,027
No, I'm still in high school.
I'm just visiting today.

1254
01:05:30,278 --> 01:05:31,988
But you're the reason
I wanna go here.

1255
01:05:34,199 --> 01:05:37,511
I just think you're the most
brilliant person in the world.

1256
01:05:37,535 --> 01:05:39,347
Oh, well. Chuckles

1257
01:05:39,371 --> 01:05:42,999
Thank you so much, but I
assure you that's not the case.

1258
01:05:43,792 --> 01:05:44,792
chuckles

1259
01:05:47,462 --> 01:05:48,588
It was nice to meet you.

1260
01:05:51,966 --> 01:05:53,009
Professor Abbott?

1261
01:05:54,094 --> 01:05:55,095
Yes?

1262
01:05:59,599 --> 01:06:01,393
I'm worried that I'm not real.

1263
01:06:02,435 --> 01:06:03,603
music fades

1264
01:06:06,648 --> 01:06:08,209
Why is that?

1265
01:06:08,233 --> 01:06:10,169
It's like what you said.

1266
01:06:10,193 --> 01:06:14,197
A lot of my thoughts and behaviors
don't even feel like they're mine.

1267
01:06:15,657 --> 01:06:20,388
Like, they're not things
I want to think or do.

1268
01:06:20,412 --> 01:06:24,165
And then when I look for the
originator of my thoughts, the real me,

1269
01:06:25,208 --> 01:06:26,418
I never find it.

1270
01:06:27,919 --> 01:06:30,231
You know those nesting dolls?

1271
01:06:30,255 --> 01:06:32,066
The ones that are hollow
and when you open them up,

1272
01:06:32,090 --> 01:06:33,943
there's a smaller one inside?

1273
01:06:33,967 --> 01:06:37,071
And you keep opening them until
eventually you get to the smallest one,

1274
01:06:37,095 --> 01:06:38,847
and it's solid all
the way through?

1275
01:06:40,306 --> 01:06:43,369
But with me, I don't think
there's one that's solid.

1276
01:06:43,393 --> 01:06:46,813
I just keep getting
smaller and smaller.

1277
01:06:52,485 --> 01:06:54,279
That reminds me of an old story.

1278
01:06:54,863 --> 01:06:55,863
Um...

1279
01:06:59,075 --> 01:07:00,761
There's this very
famous scientist,

1280
01:07:00,785 --> 01:07:05,099
and he's giving a lecture on
astronomy to a large audience.

1281
01:07:05,123 --> 01:07:08,394
And he's describing how
the Earth orbits the Sun,

1282
01:07:08,418 --> 01:07:11,689
and the Sun orbits the
galaxy, etcetera, etcetera.

1283
01:07:11,713 --> 01:07:13,315
And when he's finally done,

1284
01:07:13,339 --> 01:07:15,776
a little old lady in the back
raises her hand and says,

1285
01:07:15,800 --> 01:07:19,363
"Professor, with all due respect,
what you've just told us is bullshit.

1286
01:07:19,387 --> 01:07:24,285
The truth is, the Earth is resting
on the back of a giant turtle."

1287
01:07:24,309 --> 01:07:27,580
So, the very famous scientist
gives a smug smile and says,

1288
01:07:27,604 --> 01:07:30,332
"So, what is the
turtle resting on?"

1289
01:07:30,356 --> 01:07:32,626
And the woman replies,

1290
01:07:32,650 --> 01:07:36,672
"It's resting on the shell of
another giant turtle, of course."

1291
01:07:36,696 --> 01:07:39,425
And the scientist says,
"And that turtle?"

1292
01:07:39,449 --> 01:07:42,470
And the woman exclaims,
"Don't you understand?

1293
01:07:42,494 --> 01:07:44,871
It's turtles, all the way down."

1294
01:07:48,291 --> 01:07:50,269
You're imagining the true self,

1295
01:07:50,293 --> 01:07:54,398
the self that exists
independent of circumstance,

1296
01:07:54,422 --> 01:07:57,818
as that turtle on the
very bottom of the pile.

1297
01:07:57,842 --> 01:08:02,806
But maybe it's turtles,
all the way down.

1298
01:08:04,724 --> 01:08:05,993
Maybe you're infinite.

1299
01:08:06,017 --> 01:08:07,787
upbeat pop music building

1300
01:08:07,811 --> 01:08:13,525
And I think your doubts make
you more real, not less.

1301
01:08:17,862 --> 01:08:19,697
I think you'd do
just fine here, Aza.

1302
01:08:26,538 --> 01:08:28,081
laughs

1303
01:08:30,917 --> 01:08:32,544
laughing

1304
01:08:34,254 --> 01:08:35,380
So, how'd it go?

1305
01:08:41,594 --> 01:08:42,594
Ah.

1306
01:08:43,388 --> 01:08:44,722
both chuckle

1307
01:08:51,813 --> 01:08:55,316
Aza His bacteria are joining
your bacteria right now.

1308
01:08:56,192 --> 01:08:57,878
It doesn't matter.

1309
01:08:57,902 --> 01:08:59,612
People kiss all the time.

1310
01:09:01,656 --> 01:09:04,844
tense music playing

1311
01:09:04,868 --> 01:09:08,913
Millions of his organisms are
entering your body right now.

1312
01:09:11,040 --> 01:09:12,041
softly Hey.

1313
01:09:13,001 --> 01:09:14,127
Is everything okay?

1314
01:09:15,336 --> 01:09:16,605
Aza Hmm.

1315
01:09:16,629 --> 01:09:17,922
Yeah, I'm just, uh...

1316
01:09:20,175 --> 01:09:21,569
Just a little nauseous.

1317
01:09:21,593 --> 01:09:22,844
Be right back.

1318
01:09:26,180 --> 01:09:29,994
door opens, closes

1319
01:09:30,018 --> 01:09:31,579
- What were you thinking?
- panting

1320
01:09:31,603 --> 01:09:33,622
Everything was going perfectly
and you had to ruin it

1321
01:09:33,646 --> 01:09:35,982
by letting his tongue
into your mouth.

1322
01:09:37,358 --> 01:09:38,961
Why isn't it working?

1323
01:09:38,985 --> 01:09:41,046
- static crackles
- water running

1324
01:09:41,070 --> 01:09:43,382
panting

1325
01:09:43,406 --> 01:09:44,616
You're infected.

1326
01:09:47,327 --> 01:09:49,746
You need to kill the
bacteria now, now, now.

1327
01:09:50,788 --> 01:09:51,789
Oh, shut up!

1328
01:09:52,957 --> 01:09:55,644
Kill it. Kill every last germ.

1329
01:09:55,668 --> 01:09:57,170
Kill his saliva.

1330
01:09:59,047 --> 01:10:02,383
You know what you need to
do, so do it. Just do it.

1331
01:10:06,220 --> 01:10:07,639
music fades

1332
01:10:12,602 --> 01:10:13,853
breathing heavily

1333
01:10:29,327 --> 01:10:30,745
Aza, what's goin' on?

1334
01:10:42,006 --> 01:10:44,384
When I get stuck in my thoughts,

1335
01:10:46,552 --> 01:10:49,973
it's not just the interesting
fish stuff I told you about.

1336
01:10:52,392 --> 01:10:53,393
Okay.

1337
01:10:59,357 --> 01:11:01,693
Bacteria scares me
more than anything.

1338
01:11:03,403 --> 01:11:05,631
I'm always worried about
getting infections,

1339
01:11:05,655 --> 01:11:07,949
and once I start
worrying, I can't stop.

1340
01:11:11,619 --> 01:11:15,224
That's why I liked
your painting so much.

1341
01:11:15,248 --> 01:11:17,125
Because my thoughts
are like that.

1342
01:11:18,626 --> 01:11:23,190
They're all, like, spirally.

1343
01:11:23,214 --> 01:11:26,217
So, right now you're thinking about
whether you have an infection?

1344
01:11:27,176 --> 01:11:28,428
Kind of.

1345
01:11:33,933 --> 01:11:35,101
From kissing you.

1346
01:11:37,061 --> 01:11:39,147
somber piano music playing

1347
01:11:42,191 --> 01:11:45,462
We don't have to kiss. We can
just take things really slow.

1348
01:11:45,486 --> 01:11:46,904
You don't understand.

1349
01:11:47,905 --> 01:11:49,198
It's not logical.

1350
01:11:51,367 --> 01:11:54,096
It's like I'm
living with a demon.

1351
01:11:54,120 --> 01:11:57,790
And maybe you don't care right now,
but you won't feel that way forever.

1352
01:11:59,667 --> 01:12:00,793
But it's not forever.

1353
01:12:01,919 --> 01:12:02,962
It's now.

1354
01:12:10,344 --> 01:12:11,344
lock clicks open

1355
01:12:14,557 --> 01:12:16,160
Oh, thank God.

1356
01:12:16,184 --> 01:12:17,453
- Where have you been?
- door shuts

1357
01:12:17,477 --> 01:12:18,787
lock clicks

1358
01:12:18,811 --> 01:12:20,539
Why haven't you been
answering your phone?

1359
01:12:20,563 --> 01:12:22,023
exhales shakily

1360
01:12:23,608 --> 01:12:24,984
I was with Davis.

1361
01:12:27,695 --> 01:12:30,924
I see you at school at the same
time every single day, Aza.

1362
01:12:30,948 --> 01:12:33,093
Did you seriously think
I wasn't gonna find out?

1363
01:12:33,117 --> 01:12:36,221
I don't know. I
guess I didn't care.

1364
01:12:36,245 --> 01:12:39,683
- Well, where'd you guys go?
- We went to Chicago.

1365
01:12:39,707 --> 01:12:41,101
To Chicago?

1366
01:12:41,125 --> 01:12:43,604
What the hell were
you doing in Chicago?

1367
01:12:43,628 --> 01:12:45,064
He didn't kidnap
me. I wanted to go.

1368
01:12:45,088 --> 01:12:47,399
Well, I don't care
if you wanted to go.

1369
01:12:47,423 --> 01:12:51,320
What if something happened to you and
I didn't even know where you were?

1370
01:12:51,344 --> 01:12:54,573
Or what if you got in your head
and you needed me to calm you down?

1371
01:12:54,597 --> 01:12:56,432
You think you calm me down?

1372
01:12:57,058 --> 01:12:59,078
How, Mom?

1373
01:12:59,102 --> 01:13:01,955
Do you know why Davis
took me to Chicago today?

1374
01:13:01,979 --> 01:13:03,207
breathes shakily

1375
01:13:03,231 --> 01:13:05,501
To see Northwestern.

1376
01:13:05,525 --> 01:13:08,337
Because he actually thinks that
I can go to school on my own

1377
01:13:08,361 --> 01:13:09,922
in another state.

1378
01:13:09,946 --> 01:13:12,007
He thinks that I can
study what I wanna study,

1379
01:13:12,031 --> 01:13:13,926
and live in a dorm
with the other kids.

1380
01:13:13,950 --> 01:13:17,596
And maybe he's
wrong. Maybe I can't.

1381
01:13:17,620 --> 01:13:21,266
But do you know how good it feels
to finally have someone in my life

1382
01:13:21,290 --> 01:13:22,750
who thinks I can?

1383
01:13:24,127 --> 01:13:25,294
- Aza!
- door slams

1384

01:14:40,953 --> 01:14:43,223
"Ayala never got anything right.

1394
01:14:43,247 --> 01:14:46,542
The more Ayala worried, the
worse she made everything."

1395
01:14:49,670 --> 01:14:52,524
"Ayala sneered at
my new Speeder Bike.

1396
01:14:52,548 --> 01:14:54,860
'I thought you were
saving your money.'

1397
01:14:54,884 --> 01:15:00,240
Ayala had a Landspeeder from
her parents. What did she know?

1398
01:15:00,264 --> 01:15:03,827
Ayala wasn't a bad person.
Just a useless one."

1399
01:15:03,851 --> 01:15:05,519
music crescendoes, fades

1400
01:15:06,687 --> 01:15:07,540
gasps

1401
01:15:07,564 --> 01:15:09,732
intense pop music playing

1402
01:15:10,942 --> 01:15:12,193
cell phone vibrates

1403
01:15:25,373 --> 01:15:27,213
- locker clicks open
- cell phone vibrating

1404
01:15:36,717 --> 01:15:38,844
laughing, speaking
indistinctly

1405
01:15:45,601 --> 01:15:46,769
cell phone vibrates

1406
01:15:58,698 --> 01:16:00,133
- music stops
- Daisy Holmsey!

1407
01:16:00,157 --> 01:16:02,052
Where have you been all day?

1408
01:16:02,076 --> 01:16:04,179
Can I ride with you to Mychal's
later? My mom had to borrow my car.

1409
01:16:04,203 --> 01:16:05,830
And I need the
deets on your date.

1410
01:16:07,581 --> 01:16:09,309
I just don't get it.

1411
01:16:09,333 --> 01:16:10,936
He whisks you away to Chicago.

1412
01:16:10,960 --> 01:16:14,147
You have the most romantic
day in the history of ever.

1413
01:16:14,171 --> 01:16:16,483
chuckles Now you don't
want to see him anymore?

1414
01:16:16,507 --> 01:16:18,509
Something else must've happened.

1415
01:16:20,636 --> 01:16:21,655
Did you guys do it?

1416
01:16:21,679 --> 01:16:24,074
No. I told you nothing happened.

1417
01:16:24,098 --> 01:16:26,785
Yeah, but that doesn't make
any sense. I'm sure that...

1418
01:16:26,809 --> 01:16:28,537
I screwed it up?

1419
01:16:28,561 --> 01:16:29,687
chuckles What?

1420
01:16:30,688 --> 01:16:31,688
No.

1421
01:16:33,232 --> 01:16:35,568
You barely even changed my name.

1422
01:16:40,448 --> 01:16:41,508
You read my fanfic?

1423
01:16:41,532 --> 01:16:43,552
Yes, I read your fanfic!

1424
01:16:43,576 --> 01:16:46,912
You're my best friend. You
didn't think maybe I'd read it?

1425
01:16:48,748 --> 01:16:50,916
No, I didn't.

1426
01:16:52,418 --> 01:16:54,146
Because I've been writing
them since I was 11,

1427
01:16:54,170 --> 01:16:55,856
and you've never
read a single one.

1428
01:16:55,880 --> 01:16:58,233
What? You never asked.

1429
01:16:58,257 --> 01:17:00,610
I shouldn't have to ask.

1430
01:17:00,634 --> 01:17:03,113
Other people's best
friends would just

1431
01:17:03,137 --> 01:17:05,324
take a little break from
endlessly contemplating

1432
01:17:05,348 --> 01:17:10,037
the inner workings of their own mind to
think about other people's interests.

1433
01:17:10,061 --> 01:17:11,913
I came up with Ayala
in seventh grade.

1434
01:17:11,937 --> 01:17:15,876
And, yeah, it was a dick move,

1435
01:17:15,900 --> 01:17:18,903
but maybe it was my way of coping
with having a best friend who's...

1436
01:17:22,657 --> 01:17:26,261
Look, Mychal says that
you're like mustard, right?

1437
01:17:26,285 --> 01:17:31,874
Like, you're awesome in small
quantities, but a lot of you is a lot.

1438
01:17:33,000 --> 01:17:34,728
Got it.

1439
01:17:34,752 --> 01:17:37,564
I mean, have you ever stopped to
think about what it's like for me?

1440
01:17:37,588 --> 01:17:40,275
I constantly have your back
and you never have mine.

1441
01:17:40,299 --> 01:17:41,568
You're right.

1442
01:17:41,592 --> 01:17:42,736
All our friendship
has gotten you lately

1443
01:17:42,760 --> 01:17:44,529
is 50 grand and a boyfriend.

1444
01:17:44,553 --> 01:17:47,074
But you won't even come
with me to his art show.

1445
01:17:47,098 --> 01:17:48,557
Other people's best
friends would...

1446
01:17:49,558 --> 01:17:51,078
breathing heavily

1447
01:17:51,102 --> 01:17:53,121
I mean, I know that you have
mental problems and whatever,

1448
01:17:53,145 --> 01:17:55,248
but they make you
extremely self-centered.

1449
01:17:55,272 --> 01:17:56,792
I am not self-centered!

1450
01:17:56,816 --> 01:17:58,317
What are my parents' names?

1451
01:18:00,861 --> 01:18:02,238
What are their jobs?

1452
01:18:03,614 --> 01:18:04,758
What's my middle name?

1453
01:18:04,782 --> 01:18:06,075
Do I have any pets?

1454
01:18:09,578 --> 01:18:14,393
You're just so
pathologically uncurious

1455
01:18:14,417 --> 01:18:16,377
that you don't even know
what you don't know.

1456
01:18:18,129 --> 01:18:19,815
- You have a cat.
- Yes.

1457
01:18:19,839 --> 01:18:22,109
Congratulations,
Aza, I have a cat.

1458
01:18:22,133 --> 01:18:24,468
I've had her since I was
five. What's her name?

1459
01:18:27,012 --> 01:18:28,949
- I don't know.
- No, you have no clue.

1460
01:18:28,973 --> 01:18:33,328
You have no idea what it's like
for me, because you never ask.

1461
01:18:33,352 --> 01:18:35,622
I mean, you think you and
your mom are poor or whatever,

1462
01:18:35,646 --> 01:18:39,584
but you got braces, and a car,
and an iPad, and all that shit.

1463
01:18:39,608 --> 01:18:40,961
Do you think that
it's just normal

1464
01:18:40,985 --> 01:18:42,462
to have a house with
your own room in it?

1465
01:18:42,486 --> 01:18:44,131
And a mom who helps
you with your homework?

1466
01:18:44,155 --> 01:18:47,509
I mean, your privileges are
like oxygen to you, Aza.

1467
01:18:47,533 --> 01:18:51,012
And then you judge me for buying a car
instead of saving it all for college.

1468
01:18:51,036 --> 01:18:55,142
And I try not to care, and I try
to be understanding because...

1469
01:18:55,166 --> 01:18:56,518
Stop talking!

1470
01:18:56,542 --> 01:18:59,312
Jesus Christ, you haven't
shut up in ten years!

1471
01:18:59,336 --> 01:19:01,690
I'm sorry if it's hard
hanging out with me,

1472
01:19:01,714 --> 01:19:03,233
but imagine actually being me!

1473
01:19:03,257 --> 01:19:05,318
Imagine being stuck in
my head all the time

1474
01:19:05,342 --> 01:19:06,945
with no break, no way out!

1475
01:19:06,969 --> 01:19:08,321
I'm sorry that...

1476
01:19:08,345 --> 01:19:09,823
And to use Mychal's
clever little analogy.

1477
01:19:09,847 --> 01:19:12,242
Imagine eating
nothing but mustard!

1478
01:19:12,266 --> 01:19:14,244
Being stuck with
mustard all the time!

1479
01:19:14,268 --> 01:19:16,246
Okay, I shouldn't
have said that.

1480
01:19:16,270 --> 01:19:18,081
\an8And if you hate me so much then why
don't you just stop asking me...

1481
01:19:18,105 --> 01:19:19,416
Watch out!

1482
01:19:19,440 --> 01:19:21,233
- tense music playing
- tires screeching

1483
01:19:23,986 --> 01:19:25,029
music fades

1484
01:19:30,159 --> 01:19:32,286
somber tense music playing

1485
01:19:50,304 --> 01:19:51,514
echoing Are you okay?

1486
01:19:52,973 --> 01:19:53,910
Aza I think so.

1487
01:19:53,934 --> 01:19:55,559
breathing heavily

1488
01:19:56,769 --> 01:19:57,895
Are you?

1489
01:19:58,646 --> 01:19:59,647
You're hurt.

1490
01:20:01,524 --> 01:20:05,128
Aza, stop.

1491
01:20:05,152 --> 01:20:07,071
- Aza grunts
- Stay still.

1492
01:20:08,197 --> 01:20:09,197
Aza!

1493
01:20:10,533 --> 01:20:12,034
glass crunching

1494
01:20:13,702 --> 01:20:18,082
No, no, no.

1495
01:20:19,542 --> 01:20:20,709
crying No.

1496
01:20:31,595 --> 01:20:33,865
firefighter Hey.
Are you all right?

1497
01:20:33,889 --> 01:20:35,015
It's ruined.

1498
01:20:36,100 --> 01:20:37,577
My dad's car.

1499
01:20:37,601 --> 01:20:39,788
firefighter Honey, I've been
doing this for a long time,

1500
01:20:39,812 --> 01:20:42,749
and I can promise, your dad's
not gonna be mad at you.

1501
01:20:42,773 --> 01:20:44,275
Aza breathing heavily

1502
01:20:49,822 --> 01:20:51,716
I need help!

1503
01:20:51,740 --> 01:20:53,909
somber tense music continues

1504
01:21:02,710 --> 01:21:03,752
music fades

1505
01:21:06,714 --> 01:21:07,756
Hey, kiddo.

1506
01:21:09,592 --> 01:21:12,553
You're in the hospital, but
everything's gonna be okay.

1507
01:21:14,430 --> 01:21:15,889
I love you so much.

1508
01:21:17,683 --> 01:21:20,745
Mmm, is... Is Daisy okay?

1509
01:21:20,769 --> 01:21:23,123
They gave her some
stitches on her forehead,

1510
01:21:23,147 --> 01:21:24,690
but she's gonna be fine.

1511
01:21:26,191 --> 01:21:28,235
sobbing

1512
01:21:29,028 --> 01:21:31,089
I ruined Harold.

1513
01:21:31,113 --> 01:21:33,300
I know, baby.

1514
01:21:33,324 --> 01:21:35,159
Dad loved that car.

1515
01:21:36,619 --> 01:21:37,995
Dad loved you.

1516
01:21:39,622 --> 01:21:41,433
Am I okay?

1517
01:21:41,457 --> 01:21:43,143
You have a lacerated liver,

1518
01:21:43,167 --> 01:21:45,437
but the internal
bleeding is mild.

1519
01:21:45,461 --> 01:21:47,647
- I'm bleeding inside?
- Just a little.

1520
01:21:47,671 --> 01:21:48,982
breathing heavily

1521
01:21:49,006 --> 01:21:50,525
The good news is you
don't need surgery.

1522
01:21:50,549 --> 01:21:51,860
- They just wanna monitor you...
- sobs

1523
01:21:51,884 --> 01:21:53,111
for a few days.

1524
01:21:53,135 --> 01:21:54,136
What?

1525
01:21:55,137 --> 01:21:57,073
No. Cries

1526
01:21:57,097 --> 01:21:59,534
- No, I can't stay here, Mom.
- Aza.

1527
01:21:59,558 --> 01:22:03,079
Please, please just do
something. I can't stay here.

1528
01:22:03,103 --> 01:22:04,456
gasping

1529
01:22:04,480 --> 01:22:06,166
I have to go home.

1530
01:22:06,190 --> 01:22:08,668
I'm gonna get C. Diff if I stay.

1531
01:22:08,692 --> 01:22:10,378
- You don't have C. Diff.
- I probably

1532
01:22:10,402 --> 01:22:11,671
already have C. Diff.

1533
01:22:11,695 --> 01:22:13,673
No, you don't have C. Diff.

1534
01:22:13,697 --> 01:22:16,259
Hospitals are where
people get it, okay?

1535
01:22:16,283 --> 01:22:18,011
I can't stay here, Mom.

1536
01:22:18,035 --> 01:22:20,180
- I can't stay here!
- Aza! Aza!

1537
01:22:20,204 --> 01:22:22,891
- Your liver is bleeding! We can't go home.
- crying I have...

1538
01:22:22,915 --> 01:22:24,934
But I'll be with
you the whole time.

1539
01:22:24,958 --> 01:22:27,562
- I promise.
- I have to go. I have to go...

1540
01:22:27,586 --> 01:22:29,797
tense pulsating music playing

1541
01:22:36,345 --> 01:22:39,783
Aza C. Diff is invading
your body right now.

1542
01:22:39,807 --> 01:22:42,035
It's all around you.

1543
01:22:42,059 --> 01:22:43,370
You're infected.

1544
01:22:43,394 --> 01:22:45,705
You're full of bacteria
colonizing you.

1545
01:22:45,729 --> 01:22:49,042
It's all colonizing you,
and you can't stop it.

1546
01:22:49,066 --> 01:22:50,710
You can't.

1547
01:22:50,734 --> 01:22:53,129
You can't have a boyfriend.
You can't go to college.

1548
01:22:53,153 --> 01:22:54,464
You can't have a job.

1549
01:22:54,488 --> 01:22:56,508
You can't even control
your own brain.

1550
01:22:56,532 --> 01:22:58,659
You can't. You can't. You can't.

1551
01:23:07,459 --> 01:23:09,002
gasping

1552
01:23:10,462 --> 01:23:11,773
You know how to deal with this.

1553
01:23:11,797 --> 01:23:13,966
It's the only way.
It's the only way.

1554
01:23:16,677 --> 01:23:18,762
breathing heavily

1555
01:23:25,269 --> 01:23:26,746
Come on, kill it.
Kill the infection.

1556
01:23:26,770 --> 01:23:29,082
You have to. You
have to. You have to.

1557
01:23:29,106 --> 01:23:31,710
Please, please think
about something else.

1558
01:23:31,734 --> 01:23:32,628
Mmm!

1559
01:23:32,652 --> 01:23:34,879
I hate being stuck inside you!

1560
01:23:34,903 --> 01:23:37,340
You wanna feel better? You
know how to feel better.

1561
01:23:37,364 --> 01:23:38,967
It'll just make me sick.

1562
01:23:38,991 --> 01:23:40,719
Do you wanna die of C. Diff?

1563
01:23:40,743 --> 01:23:45,557
This is not rational. Your
now is not your forever.

1568
01:23:55,383 --> 01:23:56,776
Please, let me go.

1569
01:23:56,800 --> 01:23:58,445
- Please, I'll do anything.
- slurping

1570
01:23:58,469 --> 01:23:59,946
You can have this body.
I don't want it anymore.

1572
01:24:01,597 --> 01:24:03,491
I am my way, I am not my will.
I am my way, not my will.

1573
01:24:03,515 --> 01:24:05,034
- You'll never be free of this.
- gagging

1574
01:24:05,058 --> 01:24:07,078
- You're possessed by a demon!
- grunting

1575
01:24:07,102 --> 01:24:09,080
Do you want to die
of fucking C. Diff?

1576
01:24:09,104 --> 01:24:10,540
No! Because you will.

1577
01:24:10,564 --> 01:24:14,127
I will. You will.

1578
01:24:14,151 --> 01:24:16,045

No, no, what are you doing?

1580
01:24:18,655 --> 01:24:20,049
No, stop that.

1581
01:24:20,073 --> 01:24:22,552
- Stop it. Aza, stop that!
- Aza You're disgusting.

1582
01:24:22,576 --> 01:24:25,472
- You make me sick.
- Gina Help. Nurse!

1583
01:24:25,496 --> 01:24:27,623
- Stop it.
- You're not possessed by a demon.

1584
01:24:29,291 --> 01:24:30,834
music slows

1585
01:24:33,253 --> 01:24:35,172
You are the demon.

music fades

1587
01:24:59,613 --> 01:25:00,906
You want some breakfast?

1588
01:25:02,783 --> 01:25:03,783
Aza Mmm-mmm.

1589
01:25:06,537 --> 01:25:08,121
My stomach hurts.

1590
01:25:12,167 --> 01:25:13,460
They had to pump it.

1591
01:25:15,963 --> 01:25:16,963
sighs

1592
01:25:20,175 --> 01:25:22,427
You can probably
guess who that's from.

1593
01:25:26,139 --> 01:25:27,558
I called Dr. Singh.

1594
01:25:29,977 --> 01:25:31,228
Please don't be mad at me.

1595
01:25:33,564 --> 01:25:35,917
whispering I just
didn't know what to do.

1596
01:25:35,941 --> 01:25:37,442
I'm not mad.

1597
01:25:41,446 --> 01:25:42,573
Thank you, Mom.

1598
01:25:47,536 --> 01:25:48,620
How are you feeling?

1599
01:25:51,123 --> 01:25:52,374
Well sighs

1600
01:25:54,167 --> 01:25:55,252
not great.

1601
01:25:57,838 --> 01:26:02,426
I think it would be good for you
to start seeing me more regularly.

1602
01:26:04,177 --> 01:26:07,264
I don't want you left alone
with your thoughts for too long.

1603
01:26:10,851 --> 01:26:14,581
- Okay.
- Good.

1604
01:26:14,605 --> 01:26:18,418
I also think we should give exposure
response therapy another try,

1605
01:26:18,442 --> 01:26:20,777
and... and we can take it slow.

1606
01:26:23,322 --> 01:26:26,658
But, Aza, you have to
take your medication.

1607
01:26:28,493 --> 01:26:30,930
Or we find another medication
that works better for you

1608
01:26:30,954 --> 01:26:33,391
that you are willing
to take, as prescribed.

1609
01:26:33,415 --> 01:26:37,794
- None of them have worked.
- None of them have worked yet.

- Hi.
- Hi.

1628
01:28:35,162 --> 01:28:38,707
I'm sorry it took so
long for me to reach out.

1629
01:28:40,083 --> 01:28:41,728
It's okay.

1630
01:28:41,752 --> 01:28:44,004
I just... I needed some time.

1631
01:28:47,591 --> 01:28:48,633
I missed you.

1633
01:28:51,304 --> 01:28:53,239
I missed you, too.

1634
01:28:53,263 --> 01:28:54,907
I talked to your
mom a few times.

1636
01:28:56,892 --> 01:28:59,612

nice about keeping me updated...

1637
01:29:00,854 --> 01:29:02,939
- Aza Maybe you could kiss him.
- imperceptible

1638
01:29:04,483 --> 01:29:06,419
It'll be different.

1639
01:29:06,443 --> 01:29:09,756
- static crackles
- No, no, no. Don't kiss him.

1640
01:29:09,780 --> 01:29:11,924
You'll get sick. You'll have
to go back to the hospital.

1641
01:29:11,948 --> 01:29:13,760
Then you'll get C. Diff. You'll
have to go back to the hospital.

1642
01:29:13,784 --> 01:29:15,911
- Then you'll get C. Diff.
- How are you feeling?

1643
01:29:19,456 --> 01:29:20,892
Are you there?

1647
01:29:26,546 --> 01:29:28,757
- Sorry.
- I asked how you were feeling.

1648
01:29:29,883 --> 01:29:30,884
Good.

1649
01:29:32,469 --> 01:29:33,553
Generally.

1650
01:29:36,389 --> 01:29:37,389
Uh...

1651
01:29:39,226 --> 01:29:41,913
Not so good right now, though.

1652
01:29:41,937 --> 01:29:45,690
Could you, um, maybe sit
across from me instead?

1653
01:30:03,583 --> 01:30:05,127
I was hoping I'd be better.

1654
01:30:07,254 --> 01:30:11,675
I've been taking my meds
and working with Dr. Singh.

1655
01:30:12,759 --> 01:30:13,759
I thought

1656
01:30:15,595 --> 01:30:18,348
maybe, uh, I could
even kiss you.

1657
01:30:21,434 --> 01:30:23,270
I think I am better.

1658
01:30:25,772 --> 01:30:27,524
But I guess I'm just not

1659
01:30:30,318 --> 01:30:31,318
better enough.

1660
01:30:40,287 --> 01:30:41,621
Maybe we could text?

1661
01:30:44,708 --> 01:30:45,834
I just...

1662
01:30:49,504 --> 01:30:51,089
I need to be liked up close.

- lock clicks

1665
01:31:07,397 --> 01:31:08,481
Fine.

1666
01:31:09,316 --> 01:31:10,252
Gina Come here.

thoughtful music slows

1668
01:31:12,235 --> 01:31:18,235
You know, when you first started having
thought spirals, I was so confused.

1669
01:31:18,742 --> 01:31:20,595
You'd been such a
happy little girl,

1670
01:31:20,619 --> 01:31:23,639
and, suddenly, you were
so scared of everything.

1671
01:31:23,663 --> 01:31:26,041
And I... I couldn't
make you feel better.

1672
01:31:27,209 --> 01:31:30,146
But your dad got me through it.

1673
01:31:30,170 --> 01:31:34,066
This sounds crazy, but he'd make me
stare at my reflection in the mirror

1674
01:31:34,090 --> 01:31:37,719
and tell myself all the things
I did right that day, out loud.

1675
01:31:39,095 --> 01:31:40,448
And it worked.

1676
01:31:40,472 --> 01:31:42,349
For those few
minutes before bed,

1677
01:31:44,726 --> 01:31:46,811
I actually felt okay.

1678
01:31:47,729 --> 01:31:50,899
He was the one person

1679
01:31:52,192 --> 01:31:54,361
that made me feel good
at being your mom.

1680
01:31:56,363 --> 01:31:58,341
And now, he's gone,
inhales sharply

1681
01:31:58,365 --> 01:32:00,259
and I can't calm myself down.

1682
01:32:00,283 --> 01:32:02,512
So, I just go about my day,

1683
01:32:02,536 --> 01:32:04,889
terrified that something
bad's gonna happen.

1684

music fades

1685
01:32:06,164 --> 01:32:08,500
Terrified that I'm failing you.

1686
01:32:11,378 --> 01:32:12,378
But you're not.

1687
01:32:13,004 --> 01:32:14,440
Okay. Sniffles

1688
01:32:14,464 --> 01:32:16,383
I can do it if you want.

1689
01:32:17,676 --> 01:32:19,135
The mirror thing.

1690
01:32:21,221 --> 01:32:22,681
We can do that together.

1691
01:32:23,556 --> 01:32:25,243
No, that's okay. Laughs

1692
01:32:25,267 --> 01:32:27,036
Oh, thank God.

1693
01:32:27,060 --> 01:32:29,622
Us doing that
sounded really weird.

1694
01:32:29,646 --> 01:32:30,730
Gina chuckles

1695
01:32:32,899 --> 01:32:35,068
Aza, when the garage is redone,

1696
01:32:36,987 --> 01:32:40,383
we'll rent it out to help
pay for your tuition.

1697
01:32:40,407 --> 01:32:43,952
- Really?
- You will go to college wherever you want.

1698
01:32:45,704 --> 01:32:46,830
You know why?

1699
01:32:47,747 --> 01:32:50,059
Because you never give up.

1700
01:32:50,083 --> 01:32:51,811
That's one of the
things I love about you.

1701
01:32:51,835 --> 01:32:55,481
No matter how scared you
are, you never stop trying.

1706
01:33:06,933 --> 01:33:11,289
Davis said he needs to be liked up
close, and I can't do that right now,

1707
01:33:11,313 --> 01:33:12,999
but I'm gonna like my
best friend up close,

1708
01:33:13,023 --> 01:33:15,317
even if it kills me.
Inhales sharply

1709
01:33:17,444 --> 01:33:20,298
Hey, while we're telling
each other things,

1710
01:33:20,322 --> 01:33:23,843
when Davis and I first started
hanging out, he gave me $50,000.

1711
01:33:23,867 --> 01:33:25,511
It either goes to
me or a tuatara,

1712
01:33:25,535 --> 01:33:27,555
so I'm putting it towards
Northwestern, okay?

1713
01:33:27,579 --> 01:33:28,872
Great. Bye. Speaking Spanish

Uh, I guess I assumed
you weren't coming.

1725

Oh, and I...

1726
01:34:42,362 --> 01:34:44,673
And I'm so sorry about the
accident and your liver.

1727

1740
01:35:35,707 --> 01:35:37,459
How are you?

1741
01:35:38,418 --> 01:35:40,771
Oh, I got off easy.

1742
01:35:40,795 --> 01:35:44,191
Although, you'd never know it by
how Mychal is acting. Chuckles

1743
01:35:44,215 --> 01:35:49,971
He named all six of my stitches and
wrote them each individual love poems.

1744
01:35:53,266 --> 01:35:55,870
I'm really sorry, Daisy.

1745
01:35:55,894 --> 01:36:01,375
You deserve the most amazing, supportive,
attentive friend in the world.

1746
01:36:01,399 --> 01:36:03,860
Not one who almost killed
you in a car crash.

1747
01:36:04,777 --> 01:36:06,321
chuckling Jesus, Holmsey.

1748
01:36:07,989 --> 01:36:10,158
You can sure hold a
grudge against yourself.

1749
01:36:12,160 --> 01:36:16,498
If you can't tell, I've
already forgiven you.

1750
01:36:18,458 --> 01:36:21,687
And I'm sorry about Ayala.

1751
01:36:21,711 --> 01:36:23,689
You don't have to be.

1752
01:36:23,713 --> 01:36:24,797
Yeah.

1753
01:36:26,299 --> 01:36:27,299
I do.

1754
01:36:29,636 --> 01:36:35,636
Yes, you can be exhausting,
but you are not like mustard.

1755
01:36:35,725 --> 01:36:39,354
You're the most fascinating
person I've ever known.

1756
01:36:42,065 --> 01:36:45,252
I love you.

1757
01:36:45,276 --> 01:36:48,881
- I want to be buried next to you.
- chuckles

1758
01:36:48,905 --> 01:36:50,591
We'll have a shared tombstone.

1759
01:36:50,615 --> 01:36:55,578
It'll read, "Holmsey and Daisy.
They did everything together.

1760
01:36:57,330 --> 01:36:59,457
- Except the nasty."
- both laugh

1761
01:37:02,335 --> 01:37:03,271
Daisy Mmm.

1762
01:37:03,295 --> 01:37:05,505
gentle piano music playing

1763
01:37:07,382 --> 01:37:11,177
\an8Aza I'm not like mustard, but
maybe I'm like Indianapolis.

1764
01:37:12,595 --> 01:37:14,406
\an8They had this shit river,

1765
01:37:14,430 --> 01:37:17,368
but they worked
with what they had.

1766
01:37:17,392 --> 01:37:19,519
And they managed to build
an okay city around it.

1767
01:37:21,062 --> 01:37:23,731
Not a great city, but not bad.

1768
01:37:24,440 --> 01:37:26,835
A B-minus.

1769
01:37:26,859 --> 01:37:31,447
Well, I think you're at least
a B-plus. You and this city.

1770
01:37:32,574 --> 01:37:33,992
This skyline.

1771
01:37:35,743 --> 01:37:36,953
These tunnels.

1772
01:37:38,246 --> 01:37:39,223
This bridge.

1773
01:37:39,247 --> 01:37:40,849
both giggle

1774
01:37:40,873 --> 01:37:42,851
This sewage.

1775
01:37:42,875 --> 01:37:44,061
laughs

1776
01:37:44,085 --> 01:37:50,085
This tire, this
cinder block, this...

1777
01:37:50,216 --> 01:37:53,195
- I don't know, what are those?
- Wait, Daisy.

1778
01:37:53,219 --> 01:37:55,263
- Go back, go back, go back!
- What?

1779
01:37:56,139 --> 01:37:57,181
Isn't that...

1780
01:38:01,936 --> 01:38:04,022
tense music playing

1781
01:38:10,069 --> 01:38:11,696
exhales shakily

1782
01:38:18,328 --> 01:38:19,328
Daisy gasps

1783
01:38:25,001 --> 01:38:26,127
Pogue's Run.

1784
01:38:28,546 --> 01:38:30,816
Daisy, the spot
where a river ends,

1785
01:38:30,840 --> 01:38:32,759
- isn't it called...
- A mouth?

1786
01:38:36,763 --> 01:38:38,556
This is The Joggers Mouth.

1787
01:38:39,390 --> 01:38:41,577
What?

1788
01:38:41,601 --> 01:38:44,520
It was something Pickett scribbled
down right before escaping.

1789
01:38:50,485 --> 01:38:51,527
What's that?

1790
01:38:53,738 --> 01:38:57,033
A note to Davis and Noah.

1791
01:38:59,952 --> 01:39:01,412
The worst kind of note.

1792
01:39:07,794 --> 01:39:09,170
Do you think he jumped?

1793
01:39:13,216 --> 01:39:14,676
Should we call the cops?

1794
01:39:17,053 --> 01:39:19,948
I don't want him to find out
from some random detective.

1795
01:39:19,972 --> 01:39:21,867
music slows

1796
01:39:21,891 --> 01:39:23,226
imperceptible

1797
01:39:32,151 --> 01:39:34,237
music turns somber

1798
01:39:44,330 --> 01:39:45,373
music fades

1799
01:39:55,633 --> 01:39:57,719
somber piano music playing

1800
01:40:14,110 --> 01:40:15,110
imperceptible

1801
01:40:22,326 --> 01:40:24,370
music turns mellow

1802
01:40:32,670 --> 01:40:34,714
whooshing on TV

1803
01:40:39,302 --> 01:40:41,763
Gina So, how do I look?

1804
01:40:43,139 --> 01:40:45,284
Um, like you're
trying to get lucky.

1805
01:40:45,308 --> 01:40:49,079
- What? Is it too much? Should I change?
- Mom, no. You look amazing.

1806
01:40:49,103 --> 01:40:50,581
And by "amazing" she means hot.

1807
01:40:50,605 --> 01:40:52,106
- chuckles
- doorbell rings

1808
01:40:52,732 --> 01:40:54,626
Ooh! Get it!

1809
01:40:54,650 --> 01:40:57,904
Uh, tell Evan if he doesn't get you
home by 11:00, you're in big trouble.

1810
01:40:58,738 --> 01:40:59,738
Big trouble.

1811
01:41:03,117 --> 01:41:05,429
Well, you are far too
young to be my date.

1812
01:41:05,453 --> 01:41:06,430
both chuckle

1813
01:41:06,454 --> 01:41:07,830
Davis Hi, Mrs. Holmes.

1814
01:41:08,831 --> 01:41:09,999
Is Aza here?

1815
01:41:22,011 --> 01:41:23,011
Aza Davis.

1816
01:41:26,599 --> 01:41:28,309
I stole it from
a lizard for you.

1817
01:41:33,940 --> 01:41:34,982
Thank you.

1818
01:41:37,568 --> 01:41:39,070
Aza, Noah and I are moving.

1819
01:41:42,490 --> 01:41:43,616
Where?

1820
01:41:44,575 --> 01:41:45,785
Colorado.

1821
01:41:47,286 --> 01:41:49,455
Noah got into a special
school out there.

1822
01:41:51,707 --> 01:41:54,877
We just need a fresh start

1823
01:41:56,337 --> 01:41:57,338
after everything.

1824
01:41:59,799 --> 01:42:01,133
When are you leaving?

1825
01:42:04,136 --> 01:42:05,263
Tomorrow.

1826
01:42:08,724 --> 01:42:09,724
Aza exhales

1827
01:42:18,192 --> 01:42:19,419
You're a good brother.

1829
01:42:27,243 --> 01:42:29,161
It's a funny phrase, isn't it?

1830
01:42:32,498 --> 01:42:33,541
"In love."

1831
01:42:36,752 --> 01:42:39,297
You don't get to be
in anything else.

1832
01:42:42,717 --> 01:42:46,596
In friendship, or in hope.

1833
01:42:50,182 --> 01:42:51,976
All you can be in, is love.

1834
01:43:14,290 --> 01:43:16,542
softly I think if I don't
go now, I'll never leave.

1835
01:43:23,007 --> 01:43:24,008
Okay.

1836
01:43:31,474 --> 01:43:32,600
Goodbye, Aza.

1837
01:43:42,818 --> 01:43:44,987
soft rock guitar
music continues

1838
01:43:58,584 --> 01:43:59,835
Maybe he'll be back.

1839
01:44:01,045 --> 01:44:02,088
music fades

1840
01:44:08,761 --> 01:44:09,804
Yeah.

1841
01:44:12,932 --> 01:44:13,975
Maybe.

1842
01:44:17,728 --> 01:44:21,357
"No one ever says goodbye unless
they wanna see you again."

1843
01:44:30,908 --> 01:44:32,034
Daisy?

1844
01:44:33,411 --> 01:44:34,412
Yeah.

1845
01:44:36,080 --> 01:44:39,291
Do you think I'll ever be able
to actually be with someone?

1846
01:44:42,378 --> 01:44:43,355
Yes.

1848
01:44:45,131 --> 01:44:46,632
I think you will.

1849
01:44:49,468 --> 01:44:53,139
I think you, Aza Holmes,

1850
01:44:54,473 --> 01:44:56,559
will have a very full life.

1851
01:45:00,312 --> 01:45:04,942
I think you'll go to college
and study whatever you want.

1852
01:45:06,610 --> 01:45:07,778
And you'll have a career.

1853
01:45:10,823 --> 01:45:12,324
One that you're proud of.

1854
01:45:16,579 --> 01:45:18,706
And I think you will
be with someone.

1855
01:45:20,666 --> 01:45:21,834
Someone great.

1856
01:45:25,963 --> 01:45:27,858
I think you, Holmsey,

1857
01:45:27,882 --> 01:45:30,051
will have an
incredible love story.

1858
01:45:31,510 --> 01:45:33,554
music turns triumphant

1859
01:45:38,893 --> 01:45:42,271
I even think you'll have a
family of your own one day.

1860
01:45:50,029 --> 01:45:52,698
You're gonna make a whole
damn life for yourself.

1861
01:45:53,574 --> 01:45:54,617
I know it.

1862
01:45:57,119 --> 01:45:58,412
But I don't want to lie to you.

1863
01:45:59,538 --> 01:46:01,975
I think it'll be hard sometimes.

1864
01:46:01,999 --> 01:46:04,853
music turns poignant

1865
01:46:04,877 --> 01:46:08,464
I think, sometimes, you'll
see that life unbuilt.

music building

1867
01:46:21,852 --> 01:46:23,979
But you'll always rebuild it.

1868
01:46:26,273 --> 01:46:28,067
And you will never be alone.

1869
01:46:30,402 --> 01:46:31,821
I promise.

1870
01:46:33,572 --> 01:46:37,743
Because you will always
love and be loved.

1871
01:46:40,538 --> 01:46:43,016
And love is both

1872
01:46:43,040 --> 01:46:45,876
how you become a person and why.

1873
01:46:49,171 --> 01:46:51,215
Love, Holmsey,

1874
01:46:53,217 --> 01:46:55,487
is how you become real.

1875
01:46:55,511 --> 01:46:57,680
