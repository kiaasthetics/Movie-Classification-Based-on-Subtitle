♫ And I'm floating in a most peculiar way ♫

14

♫ I'm feeling very still ♫

22
00:03:09,871 --> 00:03:15,679

34
00:04:02,736 --> 00:04:05,324
The Alpha Intergalactic Space Station

35
00:04:05,330 --> 00:04:07,527
has reached critical mass in orbit.

36
00:04:07,727 --> 00:04:12,410
Its weight and size now pose a serious threat to Mother Earth.

37
00:04:14,210 --> 00:04:16,310
In its great wisdom, the Central Committee

38
00:04:16,314 --> 00:04:19,706
has decided to use all resources necessary to release

39
00:04:19,710 --> 00:04:22,257
the space station from the Earth's gravity.

40
00:04:23,957 --> 00:04:27,883
Its new course is set for the Magellan Current.

41
00:04:28,083 --> 00:04:29,914
Like the great explorer Magellan,

42
00:04:30,114 --> 00:04:33,565
The Alpha Station will journey into the unknown.

43
00:04:34,465 --> 00:04:36,883
A symbol of our values and knowledge,

44
00:04:37,083 --> 00:04:40,352
it will carry a message of peace and unity

45
00:04:40,362 --> 00:04:42,762
to the farthest reaches of the universe.

46
00:04:43,372 --> 00:04:45,735
Our thoughts and prayers go with you.

47
00:04:46,451 --> 00:04:49,695
God speed and good luck.

PLANET MÜL CONSTELATION QN34

51
00:05:35,873 --> 00:05:37,650
- Good morning.

52
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:35,640
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

53
00:06:35,665 --> 00:06:37,222
- Good morning.

54
00:06:37,698 --> 00:06:39,167
- Good morning.

55
00:06:40,977 --> 00:06:42,730
- Good morning.

56
00:06:45,491 --> 00:06:47,391
- Let's proceed.

57
00:07:12,704 --> 00:07:14,161
- Good morning.

58
00:07:14,186 --> 00:07:16,117
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

59
00:07:16,142 --> 00:07:17,486
- Good morning.

60
00:08:02,912 --> 00:08:07,917
So we return to nature what he gave to us.

61
00:08:15,884 --> 00:08:19,221
- Give this pearl to my daughter, Princess Lhoha.

62
00:09:43,552 --> 00:09:45,520
- What is that?

63
00:09:45,545 --> 00:09:47,312
- Take cover!

64
00:09:47,337 --> 00:09:48,783
- Come on, quickly!

65
00:09:48,808 --> 00:09:52,414
- What happened?
- There are objects falling from the sky.

66
00:09:53,949 --> 00:09:56,110
- Oh my ...

67
00:10:02,331 --> 00:10:06,131
- Secure everyone, bring them to a safe place.

68
00:10:06,156 --> 00:10:08,538
- Come on, quickly.

69
00:10:31,388 --> 00:10:33,253
- Wait!.

70
00:11:02,561 --> 00:11:04,529
- Dolark!

71
00:11:15,041 --> 00:11:17,202
- They are coming.

72
00:11:26,132 --> 00:11:28,251
- Quickly, take cover!

73
00:11:28,276 --> 00:11:29,677
- Wait...
- Come on!

74
00:11:29,702 --> 00:11:31,231
- All gather!
- Come on!

75
00:11:31,256 --> 00:11:32,757
- Faster!
- Faster!

76
00:11:32,782 --> 00:11:35,241
Come on, quickly!
- Come on.

77
00:11:42,754 --> 00:11:45,980
- It's broken!

78
00:11:46,005 --> 00:11:48,173
- Lhoha!

79
00:11:48,198 --> 00:11:50,189
- Lhoha!

80
00:11:50,214 --> 00:11:52,232
- I'm sorry.

81
00:11:55,204 --> 00:11:59,188
- No!
- Please.

82
00:12:15,322 --> 00:12:18,086
- Lhoha!

83
00:12:26,721 --> 00:12:28,808
- Goodbye.

84
00:12:49,995 --> 00:12:51,006
- You okay?

85
00:12:51,206 --> 00:12:54,350
- Yeah, just a... bad dream.

86
00:12:55,150 --> 00:12:56,388
- No.

87
00:12:58,735 --> 00:13:00,256
- But I feel better now.

88
00:13:00,327 --> 00:13:02,321
- Don't you think we should run through our assignment?

89
00:13:02,413 --> 00:13:04,213
- That's the last thing I feel like doing.

90
00:13:05,908 --> 00:13:07,769
- Not very professional, Major.

91
00:13:07,773 --> 00:13:11,063
- Look, I scored a perfect 200 on my last memory test.

92
00:13:11,202 --> 00:13:12,323
- Impressive.

93
00:13:12,363 --> 00:13:14,929
- Unfortunately, you've forgotten something rather important today.

94
00:13:16,095 --> 00:13:17,494
- What's that?

95
00:13:17,568 --> 00:13:18,851
- My birthday.

96
00:13:18,911 --> 00:13:19,907
- Hey!

97
00:13:23,907 --> 00:13:25,558
- What can I do to make it up to you?

98
00:13:25,658 --> 00:13:27,498
Beginning descent in three minutes.

99
00:13:29,198 --> 00:13:31,150
- Nothing that you can get done in three minutes.

100
00:13:34,350 --> 00:13:35,425
- Come on.

101
00:13:35,430 --> 00:13:36,946
- Don't start what you can't finish.

102
00:13:37,146 --> 00:13:40,114
Landing on planet Kyrian in five minutes.

103
00:13:40,924 --> 00:13:43,214
- Sorry. Hey, look.

104
00:13:43,220 --> 00:13:45,111
I know you're attracted to me. Why deny the obvious?

105
00:13:45,311 --> 00:13:46,615
- It's obvious?
- Yeah, sure.

106
00:13:46,815 --> 00:13:48,659
- Little goody two-shoes with an Ivy League education

107
00:13:48,663 --> 00:13:51,200
are always attracted to galaxy-hopping bad boys like me.

108
00:13:51,210 --> 00:13:53,140
- My Ivy League education taught me

109
00:13:53,145 --> 00:13:55,340
to steer clear from bad boys like you.

110
00:13:55,345 --> 00:13:56,890
- Yeah, well, you're not gonna find better than me

111
00:13:56,895 --> 00:13:59,979
on the market. Straight up. Take a good look.

112
00:14:00,179 --> 00:14:01,760
Handsome, intelligent,

113
00:14:01,765 --> 00:14:03,470
- Modest.
- Brave.

114
00:14:03,475 --> 00:14:04,925
- Suicidal.
- Determined.

115
00:14:04,930 --> 00:14:06,355
- Pig-headed.
- Faithful.

116
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:07,655
- To yourself.

117
00:14:07,855 --> 00:14:09,784
- Yeah, and to you. You're my partner.

118
00:14:09,984 --> 00:14:11,269
- Yes, don't forget it.

119
00:14:12,169 --> 00:14:13,240
- Look...

120
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:14,827
- Why don't you think with your heart

121
00:14:14,837 --> 00:14:16,090
and not your head for once?

122
00:14:16,290 --> 00:14:18,416
- I don't wanna be another name on your list of conquests.

123
00:14:18,420 --> 00:14:19,567
Thank you very much.

124
00:14:19,572 --> 00:14:20,767
- What are you talking about? What list?

125
00:14:20,771 --> 00:14:22,078
- Alex, can we see the playlist, please?

126
00:14:22,478 --> 00:14:24,130
- No, no, no, no, no, hey.

127
00:14:24,730 --> 00:14:26,751
Most of those are coworkers, and that's it.

128
00:14:26,951 --> 00:14:28,151
- Coworkers.

129
00:14:28,351 --> 00:14:30,480
- Right.  
- Where's MY picture, then?

130
00:14:30,680 --> 00:14:32,220
- They mean nothing to me.

131
00:14:32,420 --> 00:14:34,230
Okay? I took a few detours when I was younger.

132
00:14:34,235 --> 00:14:35,960
- Your last detour was not so long ago.

133
00:14:35,965 --> 00:14:38,180
- Yeah, but with you, it's different. And you know it.

134
00:14:38,380 --> 00:14:41,173
I want my heart to belong to you and no one else.

135
00:14:41,373 --> 00:14:45,632
- My heart will belong to a man who'll erase his playlist for me.

136
00:14:47,832 --> 00:14:49,300
- That's what I'm talking about.

137
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:52,640
I'm that man.

138
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:57,488
- Look, we both know you're quite a lady killer.

139
00:14:57,688 --> 00:14:59,200
So, why do you lose interest in a girl...

140
00:14:59,205 --> 00:15:00,874
as soon as you win her heart?

141
00:15:01,074 --> 00:15:02,774
- Because I'm looking for the perfect woman.

142
00:15:03,274 --> 00:15:05,288
- But you've never stopped to look.

143
00:15:05,488 --> 00:15:07,037
- That's not a crime.

144
00:15:07,237 --> 00:15:08,884
- No, it's not a crime.

145
00:15:09,084 --> 00:15:12,372
But just admit it. You're scared of commitment.

146
00:15:12,772 --> 00:15:15,080
- Me? Scared of commitment?

147
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:16,886
Are you kidding me?

148
00:15:17,086 --> 00:15:18,584
Nine years in the service.

149
00:15:18,884 --> 00:15:20,680
Impeccable record.

150
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:22,687
Seven medals of honor.

151
00:15:22,887 --> 00:15:25,646
Never lost a partner.
- Yeah, until now.

152
00:15:26,046 --> 00:15:27,431
Refuel complete.

153
00:15:30,846 --> 00:15:32,658
- Alex, did you enter the coordinates?

154
00:15:32,675 --> 00:15:33,858
I took that liberty.

155
00:15:33,863 --> 00:15:36,035
So you could both enjoy the beach a while longer.

156
00:15:36,040 --> 00:15:37,235
- Oh, thank you.

157
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:38,450
You are welcome.

158
00:15:38,650 --> 00:15:40,860
You will be leaving exospace in 30 seconds.

159
00:15:41,060 --> 00:15:42,245
- You wanna take us down?
- Yes, sir.

160
00:15:42,445 --> 00:15:44,949
- Alex, will you pull my brain charge for the last 10 minutes?

161
00:15:44,954 --> 00:15:46,449
- I had a weird dream.

162
00:15:47,549 --> 00:15:49,660
See anything abnormal?

163
00:15:49,860 --> 00:15:53,087
Your cerebral activity is a little more intense than usual.

164
00:15:53,287 --> 00:15:55,165
You received external waves.

165
00:15:55,170 --> 00:15:56,338
- Explain.

166
00:15:56,538 --> 00:15:58,657
These waves don't come from your memory.

167
00:15:58,857 --> 00:16:00,849
Somebody is sending you the images.

168
00:16:00,853 --> 00:16:02,449
- Do you know who? Where they come from?

169
00:16:02,454 --> 00:16:05,385
Negative. They could come from the present or past.

170
00:16:05,395 --> 00:16:07,481
And from anywhere in the universe.

171
00:16:07,485 --> 00:16:08,695
Leaving exospace.

172
00:16:09,295 --> 00:16:12,723
Three, two, one. Exit.

173
00:16:26,723 --> 00:16:28,201
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.
- Easy, easy.

174
00:16:28,206 --> 00:16:29,743
- We're late.
- Yeah, well, better late than dead.

175
00:16:29,747 --> 00:16:31,355
- You wanna drive?
- Whoa.

176
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:33,544
- Put your hand back on the joystick.

177
00:16:33,549 --> 00:16:36,082
Laureline, put your hands back on the joystick.

178
00:16:37,438 --> 00:16:40,015
Laureline, will you please put your hand back on the joystick?

179
00:16:40,020 --> 00:16:41,432
- Will you stop complaining about my driving?

180
00:16:41,436 --> 00:16:43,010
- Yes, I'm sorry. You're a great driver.

181
00:16:43,015 --> 00:16:44,517
You're the best driver in the entire universe.

182
00:16:44,524 --> 00:16:45,909
- Aw, thank you.

183
00:16:57,009 --> 00:16:59,144
- Intercom activated.
- Thanks.

184
00:16:59,149 --> 00:17:01,364
Touchdown on Kyrian in two minutes.

185
00:17:01,564 --> 00:17:03,038
Minister online.

186
00:17:05,190 --> 00:17:07,162
- Sir.
- Agents Valerian and Laureline.

187
00:17:07,166 --> 00:17:09,458
I trust you studied the assignment.

188
00:17:09,462 --> 00:17:12,220
So as soon as you land, recover the converter and bring it to Alpha

189
00:17:12,225 --> 00:17:13,919
for a top secret operation.

190
00:17:13,924 --> 00:17:16,245
The converter is the last creature of its species.

191
00:17:16,250 --> 00:17:18,300
- So we're counting on you.
- Yes, sir.

192
00:17:18,305 --> 00:17:20,305
- Captain Gibson has further details.

193
00:17:20,310 --> 00:17:22,173
And please, put on some more appropriate clothing.

194
00:17:22,178 --> 00:17:23,725
- Good idea.

195
00:17:23,730 --> 00:17:25,015
- Leaving manual.

196
00:17:25,020 --> 00:17:26,254
Manual disarmed.

197
00:17:28,454 --> 00:17:29,970
Intercom activated.

198
00:17:32,270 --> 00:17:34,379
- Here they come. Intruder 980.

199
00:17:34,579 --> 00:17:35,804
- Check parameters.

200
00:17:36,504 --> 00:17:38,860
- Two people on board. No parasites.

201
00:17:58,860 --> 00:18:00,163
- Where's the band?

202
00:18:00,363 --> 00:18:02,249
- You plan on going on the mission dressed like that?

203
00:18:02,449 --> 00:18:04,134
- We're supposed to mingle with tourists, aren't we?

204
00:18:04,334 --> 00:18:06,295
- What do you expect us to wear? Panda suit?

205
00:18:06,495 --> 00:18:07,635
- Nice hat.

206
00:18:18,835 --> 00:18:20,850
- Major, this mission is in-and-out.

207
00:18:21,050 --> 00:18:22,822
You enter Big Market, you find the suspect's store,

208
00:18:22,826 --> 00:18:24,450
and you team up with Sergeant Cooper.

209
00:18:24,455 --> 00:18:25,775
- I only work with my partner.

210
00:18:25,780 --> 00:18:27,280
- Hi.
- We're a team.

211
00:18:27,480 --> 00:18:30,580
- Sergeant Laureline will arrive at the drop in exactly 20 minutes.

212
00:18:30,585 --> 00:18:32,590
You will have 10 seconds to make the transfer.

213
00:18:32,790 --> 00:18:34,170
Didn't you read the memo?

214
00:18:34,570 --> 00:18:37,175
- Yeah... of course.

215
00:18:37,180 --> 00:18:38,630
- You better have.

216
00:18:42,710 --> 00:18:45,820
- How about we look at the memo one last time?

217
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:47,800
- It can't hurt.

218
00:19:10,100 --> 00:19:11,800
- You think you can survive 20 minutes without me?

219
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,400
- How could I possibly?

220
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:16,160
- Go on. Be careful.

221
00:19:16,460 --> 00:19:18,690
- Oh, uh, you must be right, I...

222
00:19:18,890 --> 00:19:22,295
... completely forgot. I have a question for you.

223
00:19:23,295 --> 00:19:24,480
- Shoot.

224
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:26,957
What?

225
00:19:29,157 --> 00:19:30,544
- Will you marry me?

226
00:19:31,344 --> 00:19:32,725
- Not funny.

227
00:19:32,925 --> 00:19:33,983
- Laureline, I'm serious.

228
00:19:34,183 --> 00:19:36,820
- I've been thinkin' about what you said earlier.

229
00:19:36,825 --> 00:19:38,600
And you're right. I need to move onward and upward.

230
00:19:38,605 --> 00:19:39,610
I need to commit.

231
00:19:39,810 --> 00:19:41,729
- Here? Just like that?

232
00:19:41,735 --> 00:19:43,420
- Yeah, why not? They sell a zillion things here.

233
00:19:43,425 --> 00:19:45,790
I'm sure we could find a priest who'd be happy to oblige.

234
00:19:48,390 --> 00:19:49,500
- Go.

235
00:19:53,500 --> 00:19:54,870
- Okay, let's go.

236
00:20:19,480 --> 00:20:21,355
We remind you that if you want to enjoy

237
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:22,995
the experience of Big Market,

238
00:20:23,005 --> 00:20:25,400
you must put on the equipment available to you.

239
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:26,655
Thank you.

240
00:20:33,060 --> 00:20:35,286
- Welcome, everybody! Welcome.

241
00:20:35,486 --> 00:20:37,200
Please, gather round. Gather round.

242
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:39,000
Now, my name is Thaziit,

243
00:20:39,005 --> 00:20:41,550
and I am your guide for today, okay.

244
00:20:41,555 --> 00:20:43,840
Now, whose first time is this at Big Market?

245
00:20:44,040 --> 00:20:45,960
Okay, lovely, lovely. Wonderful, wonderful.

246
00:20:46,160 --> 00:20:47,965
Now, let me remind you that

247
00:20:47,970 --> 00:20:49,960
Big Market is in another dimension.

248
00:20:49,965 --> 00:20:52,180
You won't be able to see it without your helmet

249
00:20:52,185 --> 00:20:54,475
or touch it without your gloves.

250
00:20:56,975 --> 00:21:01,050
But there are really a million stores in Big Market.

251
00:21:01,250 --> 00:21:03,360
- Yes, okay, ah we have one hour.

252
00:21:03,560 --> 00:21:06,360
- Now, please, watch the letters at the top

253
00:21:06,365 --> 00:21:11,020
and verify that the U for human is full green, okay?

254
00:21:11,220 --> 00:21:13,730
So everybody, please, get together

255
00:21:13,735 --> 00:21:16,050
right behind your guide whose name is?

256
00:21:16,250 --> 00:21:18,885
- Thaziit!
- Thaziit, come on, let's go!

257
00:21:20,085 --> 00:21:22,680
Follow me, please. Put your helmets on.

258
00:21:22,685 --> 00:21:24,710
- Go through the gate. 
- Okay.

259
00:21:24,715 --> 00:21:26,760
- Activate your system. Wonderful.

260
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:29,205
Do not leave with your helmet.

261
00:21:29,405 --> 00:21:30,645
System activated.

262
00:21:35,345 --> 00:21:37,070
- Whoa!

263
00:21:38,860 --> 00:21:41,655
- Welcome... to Big Market!

264
00:22:06,555 --> 00:22:07,824
- Hi!

265
00:22:08,424 --> 00:22:10,213
- Yeah, sure, of course.
- Bill?

266
00:22:10,219 --> 00:22:11,600
- Can I have my camera, please?

267
00:22:11,605 --> 00:22:12,700
- Thank you.

268
00:22:12,705 --> 00:22:13,900
- Say cheese.

269
00:22:16,300 --> 00:22:17,550
- Thank you, Bill.

270
00:22:27,550 --> 00:22:29,700
- You're good.
- Thanks.

271
00:22:36,700 --> 00:22:37,783
- Hey.

272
00:22:39,983 --> 00:22:42,700
♫ Come with me ♫

273
00:22:42,900 --> 00:22:46,970
♫ Stand by me ♫

274
00:22:47,170 --> 00:22:49,425
♫ Dance with.. ♫  
- Good luck.

275
00:22:49,430 --> 00:22:51,535
- What the hell are you doing, soldier?
- Sorry, sir.

276
00:22:51,735 --> 00:22:53,610
- Keep an eye on the guy, right?
- Yes, sir.

277
00:23:32,810 --> 00:23:34,835
- Please be careful down the stairs.

278
00:23:34,985 --> 00:23:36,235
- Come on, everyone!

279
00:23:37,630 --> 00:23:39,900
- Just think, baby, a million stores!
- Yeah.

280
00:23:39,905 --> 00:23:42,685
Only stuff that we can carry, okay?

281
00:23:42,690 --> 00:23:44,215
- I promise.
- All right.

282
00:24:02,415 --> 00:24:04,100
- All right, drop in 12 minutes.

283
00:24:04,105 --> 00:24:05,172
- Copy that.

284
00:24:28,470 --> 00:24:29,985
- I found the suspect's store.

285
00:24:30,185 --> 00:24:33,820
- Good. Sergeant Cooper will help you
get in and recover the stolen property.

286
00:24:52,420 --> 00:24:53,450
- Major Valerian.

287
00:24:53,455 --> 00:24:54,650
- Sergeant Cooper.

288
00:24:54,850 --> 00:24:55,850
- As you read in the memo,

289
00:24:55,855 --> 00:24:57,540
you need glasses to see the other dimension.

290
00:24:57,545 --> 00:25:00,010
and a transmitter box to bring anything there.

291
00:25:01,210 --> 00:25:02,332
- Especially a gun.

292
00:25:02,632 --> 00:25:03,840
Authorized.

293
00:25:04,140 --> 00:25:05,633
- Put this on.

294
00:25:07,703 --> 00:25:10,050
Enter your genetic code on the front keypad.

295
00:25:10,250 --> 00:25:12,770
To come back, enter your genetic code on the back keypad.

296
00:25:12,970 --> 00:25:14,105
- Clear?
- Crystal.

297
00:25:24,605 --> 00:25:26,790
- Good luck.
- Thanks.

298
00:25:35,090 --> 00:25:38,172
- Hey, Tsûuri! Good to see you again.

299
00:25:38,472 --> 00:25:39,740
Please sit down.

300
00:25:41,740 --> 00:25:44,460
- Do you have what we asked for?
- Yeah, yeah.

301
00:25:45,060 --> 00:25:46,550
But it was a toughie.

302
00:25:56,350 --> 00:25:58,732
I lost a lot of personnel getting this for you.

303
00:25:58,932 --> 00:26:03,065
But this... thing is priceless.

304
00:26:03,265 --> 00:26:05,093
What can you give me in exchange?

305
00:26:18,013 --> 00:26:19,760
Amazing.

306
00:26:22,350 --> 00:26:25,340
I never thought I'd see one in my lifetime.

307
00:26:25,344 --> 00:26:26,722
- You'll have hundreds of them.

308
00:26:26,726 --> 00:26:29,160
Just as soon as you give us what we came for.

309
00:26:29,360 --> 00:26:32,900
- Aw, that's where I have a slight problem, my friends.

310
00:26:33,100 --> 00:26:35,900
If you're gonna knock out copies of this baby for me,

311
00:26:35,905 --> 00:26:37,480
Why shouldn't I do it for myself?

312
00:26:39,680 --> 00:26:42,770
Hey, easy, my little lambs.

313
00:26:46,250 --> 00:26:48,085
- We absolutely need this converter.

314
00:26:48,090 --> 00:26:49,785
You know we are fighting for a noble cause.

315
00:26:49,985 --> 00:26:53,210
- I know. And I'm fighting for a noble cause too.

316
00:26:53,410 --> 00:26:54,500
Mine.

317
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:57,622
You have ten seconds to drop your guns.

318
00:26:58,222 --> 00:26:59,330
- Hmm?

319
00:27:00,030 --> 00:27:01,330
- Show time.

320
00:27:06,830 --> 00:27:08,050
Five...

321
00:27:12,050 --> 00:27:13,300
Four...

322
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:16,472
Three...

323
00:27:18,650 --> 00:27:19,850
Two...

324
00:27:21,350 --> 00:27:23,225
One...
Ooop.

325
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:25,280
- Federal Agent Valerian.

326
00:27:25,480 --> 00:27:26,940
Sorry to interrupt this great deal,

327
00:27:26,945 --> 00:27:28,355
but I'm also here for a noble cause.

328
00:27:28,360 --> 00:27:29,915
It's called the law.

329
00:27:31,515 --> 00:27:33,930
Hey, haven't I seen you guys somewhere before?

330
00:27:34,130 --> 00:27:36,060
- Hey, I'm not running a tea room here.

331
00:27:36,065 --> 00:27:37,365
What do you want from me?

332
00:27:37,370 --> 00:27:39,869
- Igon Siruss, you stand accused of stealing a Mül converter

333
00:27:39,873 --> 00:27:41,466
belonging to the Federation.

334
00:27:41,470 --> 00:27:45,750
Before I drag your ass in, I have to recover the stolen property.

335
00:27:45,950 --> 00:27:48,400
- All right, how we doing?
- Almost there.

336
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:51,700
- Valerian, I'll be to your left at three o'clock, three meters away.

337
00:27:51,710 --> 00:27:52,900
- Got you.

338
00:27:53,100 --> 00:27:54,380
Guys.

339
00:27:54,385 --> 00:27:55,680
- Don't move.

340
00:28:02,380 --> 00:28:06,315
Now, take it nice and easy, and push it into the box.

341
00:28:08,915 --> 00:28:11,145
- Converter in the box.
- Copy.

342
00:28:16,585 --> 00:28:18,300
- Undetected. Back to base.

343
00:28:18,305 --> 00:28:19,598
- Good job.
- Copy that.

344
00:28:19,602 --> 00:28:21,750
- Valerian, get out of here.
- I'm on my way.

345
00:28:33,900 --> 00:28:36,275
- I'll find you, Federal Agent Valerian.

346
00:28:36,475 --> 00:28:38,740
Wherever you are in the universe.

347
00:28:38,940 --> 00:28:40,490
I'll find you.

348
00:28:40,690 --> 00:28:43,820
And I will kill you.

349
00:28:44,020 --> 00:28:45,530
- Good luck.
- Hmm.

350
00:29:02,530 --> 00:29:03,840
- Valerian is in trouble.

351
00:29:03,940 --> 00:29:05,550
- Mission takes priority. Keep going.

352
00:29:05,750 --> 00:29:07,256
- Cooper, cover him.
- Copy that.

353
00:29:30,700 --> 00:29:33,370
- Seek and destroy. Top priority.

354
00:29:33,670 --> 00:29:35,465
Target's photograph to follow.

355
00:29:38,265 --> 00:29:40,250
- Valerian, how we doing?

356
00:29:40,450 --> 00:29:42,460
- Good. I think I lost them.

357
00:29:42,465 --> 00:29:43,888
- Are you thirsty?
- No, thank you.

358
00:29:44,088 --> 00:29:45,665
- I'm to your left, 200 feet away.

359
00:29:45,865 --> 00:29:47,385
- My keypad is broken.

360
00:29:47,585 --> 00:29:48,685
No, thank you.

361
00:29:48,785 --> 00:29:51,675
Box is broken. Can't get my arm back.

362
00:29:51,875 --> 00:29:53,770
Hey, do you need a lawyer?

363
00:29:53,970 --> 00:29:56,895
- Federal Agent on duty. Leave me alone.

364
00:30:02,295 --> 00:30:03,986
- Oh, no.
- Oh yeah.

365
00:30:26,486 --> 00:30:28,099
- Valerian, what are you doing?

366
00:31:03,699 --> 00:31:04,880
- Duh!

367
00:31:06,699 --> 00:31:08,045
- Very funny.

368
00:31:08,545 --> 00:31:09,945
What's your name?

369
00:31:10,445 --> 00:31:12,175
- Duh.
- Duh?

370
00:31:15,425 --> 00:31:17,887
- Come here. Come here. Try this.

371
00:31:18,087 --> 00:31:19,820
It's way more fun.

372
00:31:21,720 --> 00:31:23,020
- Duh!

373
00:31:26,397 --> 00:31:27,559
- So long.

374
00:31:33,759 --> 00:31:37,105
- Duh! Duh! Duh! Duh!

375
00:31:37,110 --> 00:31:39,390
- Yeah, yeah, there's a time for everything, kid.

376
00:31:39,395 --> 00:31:40,715
Don't you have homework to do?

377
00:31:43,900 --> 00:31:47,430
All right, go get yourself cleaned up. Run to mommy.

378
00:31:50,630 --> 00:31:52,330
- Mommy?
- Duh.

379
00:31:55,130 --> 00:31:56,273
- Watch out!

380
00:32:12,746 --> 00:32:13,920
Sorry!

381
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:23,661
- To retrieve your purchases,

382
00:32:23,666 --> 00:32:26,555
please place your items in the transmitter box

383
00:32:26,560 --> 00:32:29,336
and enter your DNA code. Thank you.

384
00:32:29,536 --> 00:32:32,805
- Amazing. And so practical.

385
00:32:32,810 --> 00:32:34,097
- Useless, you mean.

386
00:32:34,101 --> 00:32:36,087
- You don't even know what you'll do with the darn thing.

387
00:32:36,092 --> 00:32:38,489
- Don't be such a grouch. It's decorative.

388
00:32:38,689 --> 00:32:40,320
Try to be civilized for once.

389
00:32:43,520 --> 00:32:45,821
- Civilized. Yeah, sure.

390
00:32:50,921 --> 00:32:52,100
- Sorry!

391
00:32:54,200 --> 00:32:55,314
- Hey!

392
00:33:09,100 --> 00:33:11,114
Hey, thanks a lot!

393
00:33:11,119 --> 00:33:12,414
- Sorry!

394
00:33:18,414 --> 00:33:19,876
- I didn't see the wall.

395
00:33:19,880 --> 00:33:21,224
- Need some help?

396
00:33:21,229 --> 00:33:23,092
- I just need you to fix my arm, thanks.

397
00:33:36,192 --> 00:33:37,736
- I suppose since you asked for my hand,

398
00:33:37,740 --> 00:33:39,693
you should probably get yours back first.

399
00:33:39,697 --> 00:33:40,759
- Is that a yes?

400
00:33:40,767 --> 00:33:41,959
- Don't move.

401
00:33:44,159 --> 00:33:46,170
How can I help you if you keep moving?

402
00:33:46,175 --> 00:33:47,370
- Will you just hurry up, please?

403
00:33:48,870 --> 00:33:50,254
- Please keep still.

404
00:33:53,554 --> 00:33:54,875
- Been detected.

405
00:33:55,075 --> 00:33:56,125
- Uh...

406
00:33:56,925 --> 00:33:58,380
Sorry to bother you.

407
00:33:58,580 --> 00:34:00,522
I'm out of ammo and there is 3-headed my way.

408
00:34:00,526 --> 00:34:01,722
- Give me one second.

409
00:34:03,122 --> 00:34:04,426
- I don't have a second.

410
00:34:05,226 --> 00:34:06,802
- Okay, you're good.
- Thanks.

411
00:34:17,940 --> 00:34:19,865
- I don't know what I'd do without you.

412
00:34:32,565 --> 00:34:33,958
To retrieve you purchases,

413
00:34:33,962 --> 00:34:36,847
please place your items in the transmitter box

414
00:34:36,852 --> 00:34:40,557
and enter your DNA code. Thank you.

415
00:34:47,357 --> 00:34:48,529
- Fetch.

416
00:34:49,329 --> 00:34:50,686
-You've been detected.

417
00:34:50,690 --> 00:34:52,121
Keep moving. Don't change course.

418
00:34:52,125 --> 00:34:53,247
- What are we supposed to do?

419
00:34:53,251 --> 00:34:54,447
-Run.

420
00:34:57,347 --> 00:34:59,314
- Zito, cover them.
- Yes, sir!

421
00:35:20,414 --> 00:35:21,719
- Get in!

422
00:35:21,919 --> 00:35:23,964
- Come on, let's go, go!
- I'm comin', I'm comin'!

423
00:35:38,464 --> 00:35:40,149
- Zito, get that thing off our backs.

424
00:35:43,649 --> 00:35:44,751
- I got it.

425
00:35:49,351 --> 00:35:51,293
- Guys, take it out, take it out!

426
00:36:24,293 --> 00:36:25,675
- Alex, we need you right now.

427
00:36:33,275 --> 00:36:34,326
- Let's go.

428
00:37:12,126 --> 00:37:13,932
- Shoot; you ruined my dress.

429
00:37:14,034 --> 00:37:16,207
- Alex, I'm gonna take over on manual.

430
00:37:16,211 --> 00:37:17,758
- Prepare to enter exospace.

431
00:37:22,558 --> 00:37:24,421
- You know the coordinates for the rendezvous?

432
00:37:24,425 --> 00:37:25,997
- Yeah, I'm just set...

433
00:37:26,497 --> 00:37:27,975
- Alex, what was that?

434
00:37:27,980 --> 00:37:29,275
We have a stowaway.

435
00:37:31,218 --> 00:37:33,293
- Oh, great. Hold on.

436
00:37:37,293 --> 00:37:40,116
Major Valerian, you're running nearly 20 minutes late.

437
00:37:40,120 --> 00:37:41,861
- Yeah, well, time flies when you're havin' fun.

438
00:37:42,061 --> 00:37:43,769
- We have the Mül converter.
- Excellent.

439
00:37:43,773 --> 00:37:44,969
Now, perhaps you can tell me

440
00:37:44,973 --> 00:37:47,847
what you're doing 17 light-years from your rendezvous?

441
00:37:47,851 --> 00:37:49,776
- Yeah, it sounds pretty grim when you put it like that.

442
00:37:49,780 --> 00:37:51,882
But when you say we'll be there in... 
- nine minutes

443
00:37:51,886 --> 00:37:52,900
- Does that sound better?

444
00:37:52,904 --> 00:37:54,924
- I'll inform the commander that you're behind schedule.

445
00:37:54,928 --> 00:37:56,424
and pass on your apology.

446
00:37:56,429 --> 00:37:57,588
- Yeah, you do that.

447
00:38:00,888 --> 00:38:02,826
Leaving exospace in five seconds.

448
00:38:02,830 --> 00:38:04,667
- Somebody's gonna land with a bang.

449
00:38:21,016 --> 00:38:24,123
- Okay. Let's have a look at you.

450
00:38:25,123 --> 00:38:27,319
- Not at me, tiger. Come on.

451
00:38:27,819 --> 00:38:29,365
Don't be scared.

452
00:38:29,565 --> 00:38:30,941
I'll look after you.

453
00:38:31,141 --> 00:38:32,316
Come on.

454
00:38:34,316 --> 00:38:35,448
Hello.

455
00:38:36,984 --> 00:38:40,859
Wow! You have the most incredible eyes.

456
00:38:44,059 --> 00:38:45,282
Okay, you're a little scabby,

457
00:38:45,286 --> 00:38:46,980
so, why don't we get you a nice treatment,

458
00:38:46,984 --> 00:38:48,680
so you can get your mojo back?

459
00:38:49,880 --> 00:38:51,010
Sound good?

460
00:38:52,810 --> 00:38:54,010
Come on.

461
00:39:01,310 --> 00:39:04,110
Some high-grade uranium, and you'll be good as new.

462
00:39:09,010 --> 00:39:10,227
Hang on, tiger.

463
00:39:20,027 --> 00:39:21,145
- Alex.

464
00:39:22,545 --> 00:39:24,093
Analyze this, please.

465
00:39:26,093 --> 00:39:27,835
Power: 20 megatons?

466
00:39:27,840 --> 00:39:30,884
- Indeed. There's ten times more power in that pearl

467
00:39:30,888 --> 00:39:32,284
than in our entire ship.

468
00:39:32,288 --> 00:39:33,653
- Where does it come from?

469
00:39:33,657 --> 00:39:37,340
- From Mül, a planet that was in the constellation QN34.

470
00:39:37,540 --> 00:39:39,087
- Was?
- Yes.

471
00:39:39,287 --> 00:39:42,212
The planet no longer exists. And hasn't for 30 years.

472
00:39:42,412 --> 00:39:44,151
- Let's see what it looked like.

473
00:39:44,951 --> 00:39:46,472
Abundant vegetation.

474
00:39:46,672 --> 00:39:49,439
A few primal species, but of no particular interest.

475
00:39:50,039 --> 00:39:53,537
- The one in my dream was pretty... interesting.

476
00:39:54,137 --> 00:39:55,519
Zoom in.

477
00:39:56,819 --> 00:39:58,509
User access codes.

478
00:39:58,513 --> 00:40:00,111
- I'm afraid that won't be enough, Major.

479
00:40:00,115 --> 00:40:01,702
Access is restricted.

480
00:40:01,712 --> 00:40:03,913
- To what rank?
- General.

481
00:40:03,917 --> 00:40:05,611
Five stars.

482
00:40:07,911 --> 00:40:09,171
- The creature in my dream,

483
00:40:09,175 --> 00:40:11,135
she had a pearl just like that on her neck.

484
00:40:11,139 --> 00:40:12,471
- Noted, Major.

485
00:40:14,071 --> 00:40:15,936
Leaving exospace in one minute.

486
00:40:16,236 --> 00:40:17,932
- He's very cute, you know.

487
00:40:17,936 --> 00:40:19,422
And a real charmer.

488
00:40:19,426 --> 00:40:21,015
You may have some competition.

489
00:40:22,115 --> 00:40:23,523
- I'm fine with competition.

490
00:40:26,423 --> 00:40:28,563
Hey, I'm still waiting for your answer.

491
00:40:29,663 --> 00:40:31,558
I know I can be full of myself sometimes.

492
00:40:31,758 --> 00:40:34,154
But I'm dead serious about my proposal.

493
00:40:34,254 --> 00:40:36,159
- We have to complete the mission, Major.

494
00:40:36,163 --> 00:40:38,202
There's still the top secret part to attend to.

495
00:40:38,302 --> 00:40:40,651
Or is your perfect memory failing you again?

496
00:40:40,851 --> 00:40:42,077
Seat belt.

497
00:40:44,477 --> 00:40:45,697
- You know what?

498
00:40:46,713 --> 00:40:48,744
I'm gonna ask for ten days leave right now

499
00:40:48,748 --> 00:40:49,936
and I'm gonna take you

500
00:40:49,940 --> 00:40:51,734
to the most beautiful beach in the whole universe.

501
00:40:51,738 --> 00:40:53,250
A real beach this time.

502
00:40:54,550 --> 00:40:57,374
The perfect place for a honeymoon.

503
00:40:57,384 --> 00:40:59,134
Ten seconds.

504
00:40:59,334 --> 00:41:00,924
- The honeymoon comes after the wedding.

505
00:41:00,928 --> 00:41:02,194
You know that, right?

506
00:41:02,594 --> 00:41:05,016
- Really?
- Yup.

507
00:41:05,116 --> 00:41:08,252
Three, two, one. Decelerating.

508
00:41:10,252 --> 00:41:11,683
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

509
00:41:11,687 --> 00:41:13,535
- Alex, what are you doing?

510
00:41:13,735 --> 00:41:15,397
Sorry. Too much traffic.

511
00:41:15,597 --> 00:41:16,735
Do you want me to drive?

512
00:41:16,935 --> 00:41:19,004
Nope! No, no, no, thank you.

513
00:41:26,104 --> 00:41:30,186
Welcome to Alpha, the City of a Thousand Planets.

514
00:41:33,666 --> 00:41:34,960
Alex, can you update us?

515
00:41:34,970 --> 00:41:36,570
I'd be delighted to.

516
00:41:36,770 --> 00:41:39,699
The Alpha Station has grown 7% this year.

517
00:41:39,899 --> 00:41:42,665
And since it left the terrestrial orbit,

518
00:41:42,670 --> 00:41:45,411
it has travelled almost 700 million miles.

519
00:41:47,211 --> 00:41:50,287
- Population?
- Almost 30 million.

520
00:41:50,487 --> 00:41:52,540
3236 species

521
00:41:52,545 --> 00:41:55,500
from the four corners of the universe live on board.

522
00:41:55,570 --> 00:41:57,762
Pooling their knowledge and cultures.

523
00:41:58,062 --> 00:42:00,303
Over 5000 languages spoken.

524
00:42:00,393 --> 00:42:02,863
Not counting the various computer languages.

525
00:42:02,900 --> 00:42:04,140
Demographics?

526
00:42:04,340 --> 00:42:06,536
To the south are the submerged parts

527
00:42:06,540 --> 00:42:09,817
with 800 species living in all kinds of liquids.

528
00:42:10,017 --> 00:42:11,985
Such as the peaceful Poulong Farmers

529
00:42:11,990 --> 00:42:13,321
who grow cobalt.

530
00:42:13,991 --> 00:42:16,904
To the north, we have gaseous lands

531
00:42:16,908 --> 00:42:18,730
dominated by the Azin Mö

532
00:42:18,750 --> 00:42:21,363
whose extreme sensitivity makes them specialists

533
00:42:21,367 --> 00:42:24,524
in neurosciences and molecular components.

534
00:42:24,528 --> 00:42:26,624
They can build cells of any kind.

535
00:42:26,824 --> 00:42:28,180
To the east of them,

536
00:42:28,184 --> 00:42:30,290
the large colony of Omelites.

537
00:42:30,295 --> 00:42:34,075
They control information technology, finance, and banking.

538
00:42:34,275 --> 00:42:36,275
Finally, to the west,

539
00:42:36,280 --> 00:42:37,880
in a pressurized atmosphere,

540
00:42:37,888 --> 00:42:40,558
we have nine million humans and compatible species.

541
00:42:40,564 --> 00:42:42,200
Home sweet home.

542
00:42:42,210 --> 00:42:44,470
The economy has been in shambles for a year.

543
00:42:44,480 --> 00:42:45,870
Do you want a quick summary?

544
00:42:45,880 --> 00:42:48,745
No. That's enough excitement for one day.

545
00:42:55,080 --> 00:42:56,900
Intruder XB982

546
00:42:56,905 --> 00:42:58,724
authorization to dock on Section One.

547
00:42:58,758 --> 00:43:01,816
- VIP access.
- Oh, we're famous.

548
00:43:19,316 --> 00:43:20,720
You're late, Major.

549
00:43:20,725 --> 00:43:23,730
Sorry, sir. Things had been more complicated than we expected.

550
00:43:23,930 --> 00:43:25,615
Prepare for the worst and you won't be disappointed.

551
00:43:25,620 --> 00:43:26,754
And neither will I.

552
00:43:27,254 --> 00:43:30,371
I'll keep that in mind, Sir.

553
00:43:32,571 --> 00:43:34,544
And you, have you checked the converter?

554
00:43:34,548 --> 00:43:35,740
He's in great shape.

555
00:43:35,745 --> 00:43:37,039
May I ask what's going on?

556
00:43:38,239 --> 00:43:39,587
Follow me.

557
00:43:43,787 --> 00:43:44,963
Declassify.

558
00:43:47,735 --> 00:43:50,394
A year ago, we discovered a radioactive zone

559
00:43:50,398 --> 00:43:52,265
right in the middle of the station.

560
00:43:53,165 --> 00:43:55,151
No signal of any kind can get through it.

561
00:43:55,155 --> 00:43:57,367
We sent several probes, none came back.

562
00:43:57,567 --> 00:43:59,771
So, we sent in a special unit.

563
00:43:59,971 --> 00:44:02,440
Its mission was to get as close to the zone as possible.

564
00:44:02,640 --> 00:44:04,745
And to find the nature of the threat.

565
00:44:04,760 --> 00:44:06,003
And?

566
00:44:06,703 --> 00:44:08,286
No one came back alive.

567
00:44:09,386 --> 00:44:10,998
Any idea who attacked them?

568
00:44:11,003 --> 00:44:12,198
No.

569
00:44:12,750 --> 00:44:14,428
This is the situation today.

570
00:44:16,328 --> 00:44:18,807
The air in the zone is unbreathable.

571
00:44:18,811 --> 00:44:20,358
Highly contaminated.

572
00:44:21,258 --> 00:44:22,765
And it continues to grow.

573
00:44:22,865 --> 00:44:24,314
Like a tumor.

574
00:44:24,320 --> 00:44:26,440
A tumor we have to cut out as soon as we can.

575
00:44:26,640 --> 00:44:28,276
If we don't and the cancer keeps spreading,

576
00:44:28,280 --> 00:44:30,516
it will destroy Alpha in less than a week.

577
00:44:30,716 --> 00:44:33,202
Commander, who would have any reason to destroy Alpha?

578
00:44:33,210 --> 00:44:35,266
Practically every living species is represented here.

579
00:44:35,270 --> 00:44:36,686
This is a weapon of mass destruction.

580
00:44:36,690 --> 00:44:38,267
And behind every weapon, there is a killer.

581
00:44:38,271 --> 00:44:41,108
It doesn't matter who it is. It's a threat to us all.

582
00:44:41,112 --> 00:44:42,562
It must be eliminated.

583
00:44:42,580 --> 00:44:43,662
Through here.

584
00:44:50,891 --> 00:44:52,049
- Commander.
- Minister.

585
00:44:52,100 --> 00:44:54,045
The Council has given you the green light.

586
00:44:54,090 --> 00:44:57,212
But we strongly recommend that international law

587
00:44:57,222 --> 00:44:59,547
and the civil rights of all
concerned should be respected.

588
00:44:59,747 --> 00:45:01,339
Of course. I shall see to it personally.

589
00:45:01,539 --> 00:45:03,594
Agents Valerian and Laureline will be responsible

590
00:45:03,598 --> 00:45:04,882
for your personal protection.

591
00:45:04,886 --> 00:45:06,505
Sir, that won't be necessary.

592
00:45:06,510 --> 00:45:09,105
I have a unit of K-Tron that are personally trained...

593
00:45:09,110 --> 00:45:11,676
It's a direct order from the government, Commander.

594
00:45:11,680 --> 00:45:14,810
The two agents need to report on the outcome of the operations.

595
00:45:17,510 --> 00:45:18,812
As you wish.

596
00:45:19,012 --> 00:45:22,370
Gentlemen, lady, good luck.

597
00:45:26,125 --> 00:45:27,628
Since we have to be on the same team,

598
00:45:27,632 --> 00:45:29,550
You mind giving us an update on the operation?

599
00:45:29,650 --> 00:45:32,720
I'll be speaking to the Security Council in a few minutes.

600
00:45:32,920 --> 00:45:35,662
You'll have all the details you need to know.

601
00:45:37,762 --> 00:45:39,915
This is gonna be a lot of fun.

602
00:45:49,515 --> 00:45:52,811
Hey, handsome. You're looking a lot better.

603
00:45:53,511 --> 00:45:56,357
You know, I remember learning about you guys at school.

604
00:45:57,477 --> 00:45:59,987
I'm dying to find out if what they say is true.

605
00:46:08,687 --> 00:46:09,793
Wow.

606
00:46:10,959 --> 00:46:12,821
I need to take you shopping with me.

607
00:46:21,902 --> 00:46:23,310
Wait for me here.

608
00:46:39,410 --> 00:46:41,105
- Anything?
- Not yet.

609
00:46:41,405 --> 00:46:43,146
We haven't got a peep out of him.

610
00:46:43,150 --> 00:46:44,739
But I'm trying something new.

611
00:46:49,839 --> 00:46:51,129
One more hour.

612
00:46:52,829 --> 00:46:54,827
If he hasn't talked, finish him off.

613
00:46:55,027 --> 00:46:56,214
Yes, sir.

614
00:47:06,281 --> 00:47:08,935
If anything goes wrong with this operation,

615
00:47:10,588 --> 00:47:12,728
you know what you have to do.

616
00:47:30,433 --> 00:47:31,510
Wow.

617
00:47:31,710 --> 00:47:34,800
Looks like you're taking my protection very seriously.

618
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:36,804
His protection, actually. He's one of a kind.

619
00:47:36,809 --> 00:47:39,266
You sure he needs to come along in such a dangerous mission?

620
00:47:39,466 --> 00:47:41,307
The Mül converter is capable of reproducing

621
00:47:41,311 --> 00:47:43,695
any conceivable product in record time.

622
00:47:43,895 --> 00:47:46,235
It will come in very handy if we have to negotiate.

623
00:47:46,240 --> 00:47:47,735
You have the K-Trons on your command

624
00:47:47,740 --> 00:47:49,530
I'm surprised negotiating's on the table.

625
00:47:50,490 --> 00:47:52,447
You take care of my security, Major.

626
00:47:52,847 --> 00:47:54,855
I'll take care of any negotiations.

627
00:47:54,865 --> 00:47:55,900
Give it to me.

628
00:47:55,905 --> 00:47:57,300
I don't think that's a very good idea.

629
00:47:57,305 --> 00:47:58,661
For your personal security,

630
00:47:58,665 --> 00:48:00,247
why don't you let Agent Laureline look after

631
00:48:00,251 --> 00:48:01,730
the little guy for safe keeping?

632
00:48:01,735 --> 00:48:04,366
I don't think so, Major. It's against protocol.

633
00:48:04,566 --> 00:48:05,808
I am the highest-ranking...

634
00:48:05,812 --> 00:48:08,125
That animal is the last living specimen of its species.

635
00:48:08,130 --> 00:48:09,636
The whole universe is after it.

636
00:48:09,640 --> 00:48:12,042
That's why Major Valerian would rather I held on to it.

637
00:48:14,542 --> 00:48:15,670
All right.

638
00:48:17,770 --> 00:48:19,309
Just don't leave my sight.

639
00:48:26,009 --> 00:48:27,499
Commander, the Council is waiting.

640
00:48:29,099 --> 00:48:30,281
Okay.

641
00:48:31,330 --> 00:48:32,960
Let's do this.

642
00:48:36,660 --> 00:48:38,320
Stay here.

643
00:48:43,430 --> 00:48:44,690
On route to the meeting.

644
00:48:44,700 --> 00:48:46,050
Received, General.

645
00:48:54,118 --> 00:48:55,569
You stay on back up.

646
00:48:55,669 --> 00:48:56,956
I'll take the front line.

647
00:48:58,956 --> 00:49:00,446
Yes, sir!

648
00:49:07,996 --> 00:49:10,525
Delegates, thank you for answering the call so quickly.

649
00:49:11,625 --> 00:49:14,285
As the elective representative of the Human Federation,

650
00:49:14,290 --> 00:49:16,323
I have called this meeting of the Alpha Security Council

651
00:49:16,327 --> 00:49:18,573
to update you regarding the state of emergency

652
00:49:18,577 --> 00:49:20,073
we find ourselves in.

653
00:49:20,273 --> 00:49:21,591
As you all know,

654
00:49:21,791 --> 00:49:23,860
The heart of historic Alpha Station

655
00:49:23,865 --> 00:49:26,421
has been contaminated by a force whose power

656
00:49:26,426 --> 00:49:28,221
we do not know the origins of.

657
00:49:28,421 --> 00:49:30,447
The Human Federation has launched

658
00:49:30,451 --> 00:49:32,072
several small military attacks

659
00:49:32,076 --> 00:49:34,190
in order to ascertain the severity of the threat.

660
00:49:35,190 --> 00:49:36,980
But these have all ended in failure.

661
00:49:37,180 --> 00:49:40,047
And with some significant losses among our troops.

662
00:49:40,067 --> 00:49:43,192
In light of this alarming and growing threat to us all,

663
00:49:43,392 --> 00:49:44,741
the Human Federation is seeking...

664
00:49:44,745 --> 00:49:46,159
Everything okay?

665
00:49:46,781 --> 00:49:49,172
You're missing out. I'm having a lot of fun.

666
00:49:49,672 --> 00:49:51,927
Yeah, don't worry, we'll be on the beach soon.

667
00:49:52,612 --> 00:49:54,489
I can now answer some questions you may have

668
00:49:54,493 --> 00:49:56,247
about the details of the operation.

669
00:50:01,842 --> 00:50:04,257
13th battalion, Special Assaults Division.

670
00:50:04,657 --> 00:50:05,680
Ooh, there she is!

671
00:50:05,682 --> 00:50:07,060
- I told you she's there.
- Yoohoo!

672
00:50:07,065 --> 00:50:09,311
- Ugh, that's all I need.
- Agent Laureline!

673
00:50:09,410 --> 00:50:11,070
- What?
- Doghan Daguis.

674
00:50:11,075 --> 00:50:12,270
Oh.

675
00:50:12,320 --> 00:50:14,772
- Nice to see you again.
- Agent Laureline.

676
00:50:14,774 --> 00:50:15,756
Splendid as ever.

677
00:50:15,760 --> 00:50:17,090
Just tell me what you want.

678
00:50:17,290 --> 00:50:19,516
- We go where work calls.
- We speak over 5,000 languages.

679
00:50:19,518 --> 00:50:21,766
- Which can be handy.
- In a party like this.

680
00:50:21,768 --> 00:50:23,058
Need our services?

681
00:50:23,258 --> 00:50:25,394
I have my own personal translator.

682
00:50:25,794 --> 00:50:27,072
Now, move.

683
00:50:27,272 --> 00:50:29,124
Ask them if they have Intel on Mül.

684
00:50:31,032 --> 00:50:33,067
Planet Mül, ring any bells?

685
00:50:33,267 --> 00:50:35,991
- A highly sensitive matter.
- Best person to speak to.

686
00:50:35,993 --> 00:50:36,840
- Would be Major Samk.

687
00:50:36,845 --> 00:50:37,957
- Alex?

688
00:50:39,257 --> 00:50:40,770
- Major Samk died a year ago.

689
00:50:40,970 --> 00:50:44,100
- Well, yes, a most curious demise.
- That was not fully explained.

690
00:50:44,102 --> 00:50:45,664
- Murder, some might call it.

691
00:50:47,300 --> 00:50:49,240
- Major Samk was an expert on Planet Mül.

692
00:50:49,242 --> 00:50:50,633
- He took all that precious information.

693
00:50:50,635 --> 00:50:52,311
- To the grave with him.
- What a waste.

694
00:50:52,511 --> 00:50:55,769
- If you receive any Intel on this planet, we're interested.

695
00:50:55,776 --> 00:50:57,600
- It would be a pleasure to work for you, Laureline.

696
00:50:57,605 --> 00:50:58,603
- Mmhmm.
- Before we go,

697
00:50:58,607 --> 00:50:59,655
- We would like to give you.

698
00:50:59,658 --> 00:51:00,855
- Some info.
- For free.

699
00:51:01,455 --> 00:51:02,720
- For free?
- Mmhmm.

700
00:51:02,725 --> 00:51:03,935
- You guys must be sick.

701
00:51:04,135 --> 00:51:06,164
- The converter is precious.
- And highly sought after.

702
00:51:06,364 --> 00:51:07,910
- Mercenaries will come.
- To retrieve it.

703
00:51:07,913 --> 00:51:08,879
- Sooner than you think.

704
00:51:08,882 --> 00:51:09,959
What kind of mercenaries?

705
00:51:09,962 --> 00:51:12,362
- The first tip was free.
- You must pay for more.

706
00:51:12,365 --> 00:51:13,670
- You get a discount, of course.

707
00:51:17,489 --> 00:51:18,597
General,

708
00:51:18,697 --> 00:51:19,874
- We have an alert on section B.

709
00:51:19,878 --> 00:51:20,917
- Alex, what's that?

710
00:51:20,921 --> 00:51:22,458
A dozen individuals approaching.

711
00:51:22,462 --> 00:51:23,801
- What kind of individuals?

712
00:51:23,805 --> 00:51:25,370
- Undetectable for now.

713
00:51:25,570 --> 00:51:27,565
- It appears your info just lost its value.

714
00:51:28,165 --> 00:51:29,693
- Now get out of my face.

715
00:51:30,993 --> 00:51:32,270
Move, pigeons.

716
00:51:32,370 --> 00:51:33,464
- She just called us pigeons.

717
00:51:33,467 --> 00:51:34,560
- What's a pigeon?
- I don't know.

718
00:51:37,260 --> 00:51:38,667
- Where are they coming from?

719
00:51:38,675 --> 00:51:40,592
Everywhere. They're going through the walls.

720
00:51:40,630 --> 00:51:42,312
- Alex, I need to know the attackers' identity.

721
00:51:42,512 --> 00:51:44,530
- Everyone, please evacuate.

722
00:51:45,130 --> 00:51:47,534
- I cannot read their DNA.
- What?

723
00:51:50,030 --> 00:51:51,120
- Sir,

724
00:51:51,125 --> 00:51:52,320
The door's locked.

725
00:51:52,330 --> 00:51:53,441
- We can't get out.

726
00:51:53,641 --> 00:51:55,026
- Laureline.
- I'm coming.

727
00:51:58,526 --> 00:52:00,702
- Evacuate the Commander.
- Copy that.

728
00:52:00,902 --> 00:52:02,956
- General, secure that door.

729
00:52:03,056 --> 00:52:04,156
- Commander...

730
00:52:04,160 --> 00:52:05,356
...what's going on?

731
00:52:05,360 --> 00:52:06,408
- We need to evacuate.
- Let's go.

732
00:52:09,608 --> 00:52:10,808
- It's not working.
- What?

733
00:52:11,166 --> 00:52:12,470
- Alex, open the door.

734
00:54:08,140 --> 00:54:10,351
- What was that?
- The Pearls.

735
00:54:10,371 --> 00:54:11,477
- They took the Commander.

736
00:54:11,677 --> 00:54:13,928
- Here, take this. Free the General.

737
00:54:13,935 --> 00:54:15,765
- Go to the command room and track 'em from there.

738
00:54:15,770 --> 00:54:16,865
- Okay.

739
00:54:29,299 --> 00:54:31,074
- Are we back to full power?
- Yes, sir, just now.

740
00:54:31,100 --> 00:54:32,516
- Everybody, back to your posts!

741
00:54:38,095 --> 00:54:40,433
- Status on Major Valerian. Level five emergency.

742
00:54:40,438 --> 00:54:41,633
- Confirmed.

743
00:54:43,533 --> 00:54:44,937
- Valerian, I've got you on visual.

744
00:54:44,941 --> 00:54:46,150
- Okay, but I've lost track of 'em.

745
00:54:46,154 --> 00:54:47,583
- Try to locate the Commander.

746
00:54:54,083 --> 00:54:55,580
- Okay, I've got him.

747
00:54:55,600 --> 00:54:56,875
- He's near the docking bay,

748
00:54:56,880 --> 00:54:58,375
so he must be headed towards the vessel.

749
00:55:00,216 --> 00:55:03,041
- Okay. What's the shortest way there?

750
00:55:03,241 --> 00:55:05,841
- North-northeast, 113 degrees.

751
00:55:05,941 --> 00:55:10,293
60... 70... 80... 90...

752
00:55:11,183 --> 00:55:13,098
- That leads me straight into a wall.

753
00:55:13,108 --> 00:55:14,519
- You said you wanted the shortest way.

754
00:55:56,666 --> 00:55:59,091
- It may be the shortest way, but it's not the easiest.

755
00:56:07,837 --> 00:56:08,909
- Keep going.

756
00:56:09,009 --> 00:56:10,209
You're almost there.

757
00:56:23,109 --> 00:56:24,576
- They've reached another ship.

758
00:56:24,626 --> 00:56:25,928
- No tags. Unknown model.

759
00:56:25,958 --> 00:56:27,948
- Valerian, they've boarded. Change of plan.

760
00:56:27,954 --> 00:56:30,519
140 degrees east. Alex will pick you up.

761
00:56:35,219 --> 00:56:37,904
- 81?
- That's it, 81, straight.

762
00:56:39,604 --> 00:56:41,955
- Whoa, whoa, whoa! 81, you're sure?

763
00:56:41,965 --> 00:56:43,198
- Yes, I'm sure.

764
00:56:43,298 --> 00:56:45,408
- Because I just went through, and I'm falling in space.

765
00:56:49,595 --> 00:56:51,661
- Sorry, my mistake. It was number 18.

766
00:56:51,670 --> 00:56:53,829
- That's okay. We all make mistakes.

767
00:56:54,029 --> 00:56:55,591
Any idea to get me out of here?

768
00:56:55,791 --> 00:56:57,679
- Alex, pick him up on 81.

769
00:57:10,261 --> 00:57:12,034
- I'm in. Close it.

770
00:57:19,435 --> 00:57:22,364
Ah. Bring on the beach.

771
00:57:31,864 --> 00:57:33,675
I'm not sure where you come from.

772
00:57:33,875 --> 00:57:35,520
But I know where I wanna send you.

773
00:57:50,920 --> 00:57:52,459
- Valerian, hold still.

774
00:57:52,659 --> 00:57:54,347
- We're analyzing its system of defense.

775
00:57:59,347 --> 00:58:01,531
Major, their protective shield is too sophisticated.

776
00:58:01,535 --> 00:58:02,724
You won't get through.

777
00:58:02,824 --> 00:58:03,939
- I'm gonna try something bigger.

778
00:58:09,039 --> 00:58:10,339
Shit.

779
00:58:14,739 --> 00:58:16,802
- Laureline, which one has the Commander on board?

780
00:58:17,402 --> 00:58:19,489
- Nine o'clock, lower level. Hurry up.

781
00:58:21,489 --> 00:58:23,348
That's the one. Don't lose it.

782
00:58:35,733 --> 00:58:37,059
Valerian, be careful.

783
00:58:54,614 --> 00:58:55,814
- The Intruder's too big to follow him.

784
00:58:56,014 --> 00:58:57,404
I'm gonna take the Skyjet.

785
00:58:57,904 --> 00:58:59,134
- Okay.

786
00:59:15,614 --> 00:59:17,941
Okay, Valerian. You're near the dead zone.

787
00:59:18,141 --> 00:59:19,813
Reel them in before I lose you.

788
00:59:19,913 --> 00:59:21,228
- I'm working on it.

789
00:59:38,528 --> 00:59:40,148
- Valerian, you need to go faster.

790
00:59:49,148 --> 00:59:51,304
Valerian, you've got ten seconds before I lose you.

791
00:59:51,404 --> 00:59:52,604
- Take that!

792
00:59:56,204 --> 00:59:57,665
Who's the clever one now?

793
00:59:57,670 --> 00:59:59,768
- Valerian, you've got five seconds.

794
01:00:03,077 --> 01:00:05,257
- Oh, no, not me.

795
01:00:09,057 --> 01:00:11,085
- Valerian?
- I can't slow him down.

796
01:00:11,090 --> 01:00:12,285
Come on.

797
01:00:12,585 --> 01:00:13,801
Come on.

798
01:00:14,301 --> 01:00:15,515
Entering Red Zone.

799
01:00:16,115 --> 01:00:17,347
Entering Red Zone.

800
01:00:17,647 --> 01:00:19,189
- Valerian, do you hear me?

801
01:00:20,389 --> 01:00:21,597
- Laureline!

802
01:00:21,606 --> 01:00:23,504
I'm losing control!

803
01:00:23,604 --> 01:00:24,819
Laureline!

804
01:00:26,619 --> 01:00:28,224
- Valerian, answer me.

805
01:00:28,524 --> 01:00:30,102
Valerian, answer me.

806
01:00:30,109 --> 01:00:31,215
Major, respond.

807
01:00:31,415 --> 01:00:32,580
- Alex, can you help?

808
01:00:32,780 --> 01:00:34,119
There's too much interference.

809
01:00:34,319 --> 01:00:35,826
I've lost the Major's signal.

810
01:00:39,826 --> 01:00:42,718
- Valerian? Valerian?

811
01:00:45,018 --> 01:00:46,717
Valerian, do you copy?

812
01:00:47,717 --> 01:00:49,089
We've lost him.

813
01:00:49,289 --> 01:00:51,548
- Sergeant, where are you going?
- To grab my Skyjet.

814
01:00:51,748 --> 01:00:54,300
- You won't be going after him.
- Why not?

815
01:00:54,500 --> 01:00:56,775
- That zone is under enemy control. It's too dangerous.

816
01:00:56,800 --> 01:00:58,170
- An enemy that we don't know.

817
01:00:58,175 --> 01:00:59,680
- An enemy that's just attacked us.

818
01:00:59,710 --> 01:01:01,854
By putting us to sleep and not hurting a single one of us.

819
01:01:02,054 --> 01:01:04,262
Why would they spare our lives?
Give me one good reason.

820
01:01:05,550 --> 01:01:06,731
- I don't know.

821
01:01:06,750 --> 01:01:08,170
Valerian has seen these creatures before.

822
01:01:08,175 --> 01:01:09,837
They are from planet Mül.

823
01:01:10,037 --> 01:01:12,167
- Planet Mül was destroyed 30 years ago.

824
01:01:12,177 --> 01:01:13,946
You're not making any sense.

825
01:01:13,951 --> 01:01:15,618
- It's our mission that doesn't make sense, Sir.

826
01:01:15,638 --> 01:01:16,950
Someone is lying to us.

827
01:01:16,955 --> 01:01:20,006
And while you find out who, I'm going to go save my partner.

828
01:01:28,253 --> 01:01:32,248
General, Major Valerian is an invaluable agent.

829
01:01:32,448 --> 01:01:34,083
You cannot afford to lose him.

830
01:01:34,283 --> 01:01:36,628
- No, I can't afford to lose both of you in one day.

831
01:01:37,328 --> 01:01:38,709
Restrain her.

832
01:01:44,424 --> 01:01:45,665
Put us on high alert.

833
01:01:46,265 --> 01:01:48,145
And find me the Commander.

834
01:01:48,345 --> 01:01:49,345
- Yes, sir.

835
01:02:07,731 --> 01:02:10,988
- Listen, I don't wanna tell you guys how to do your jobs,

836
01:02:10,993 --> 01:02:12,779
but don't you think you should cuff me?

837
01:02:12,784 --> 01:02:14,447
Firstly, because it's protocol.

838
01:02:14,452 --> 01:02:17,154
But secondly, because I'm very tempted to escape.

839
01:02:33,054 --> 01:02:34,302
Good job, boys.

840
01:02:40,202 --> 01:02:41,523
We need to talk.

841
01:02:42,623 --> 01:02:45,340
- Oh, it's dark in here.
- Not supposed to be here.

842
01:02:46,923 --> 01:02:48,384
- Ow!
- Sorry.

843
01:02:48,389 --> 01:02:49,804
- If you don't help me find Valerian,

844
01:02:49,814 --> 01:02:51,519
then this bullet's gonna find you.

845
01:02:51,619 --> 01:02:52,769
- You're up first.

846
01:02:52,969 --> 01:02:55,656
- No, no, no, no.
- It's to avoid such situations.

847
01:02:55,661 --> 01:02:57,817
- But all of our information.
- Is divided three ways.

848
01:02:57,821 --> 01:02:59,554
- Kill one of us.
- And you kill the information.

849
01:02:59,654 --> 01:03:00,731
- What a pity that would be.

850
01:03:00,781 --> 01:03:02,995
- Okay, you're gonna have to give me credit, though.

851
01:03:03,001 --> 01:03:04,130
beause I don't have much on me.

852
01:03:04,330 --> 01:03:06,314
- Oh, how tiresome.
- If the Commander were here,

853
01:03:06,514 --> 01:03:07,706
he could use the converter to pay us.

854
01:03:07,711 --> 01:03:09,031
- But he is been abducted.

855
01:03:09,036 --> 01:03:10,697
- Precisely, because he had the converter on him.

856
01:03:10,701 --> 01:03:12,238
- Unless for security reasons.

857
01:03:12,242 --> 01:03:13,899
- Someone else was carrying it on them.

858
01:03:14,099 --> 01:03:16,868
- How in space did you get that info?

859
01:03:17,068 --> 01:03:18,633
- It's not info.
- Just deduction.

860
01:03:18,833 --> 01:03:21,761
- We know how humans work.
- They're all so predictable.

861
01:03:21,961 --> 01:03:23,474
- Clearly, you've never met a woman.

862
01:03:23,674 --> 01:03:26,095
- Okay, okay, okay.
- Calm down.

863
01:03:26,097 --> 01:03:27,103
- What do you want to know?

864
01:03:27,105 --> 01:03:28,721
- Valerian's exact location.

865
01:03:28,726 --> 01:03:29,806
- Hard to tell.

866
01:03:29,808 --> 01:03:30,855
- But we know how to track him down.

867
01:03:30,859 --> 01:03:32,198
- With complete precision.

868
01:03:32,398 --> 01:03:34,680
- How much?
- 100 badools.

869
01:03:34,684 --> 01:03:36,654
- Each.
- Forget about it.

870
01:03:36,854 --> 01:03:38,683
- This is all I have.

871
01:03:40,810 --> 01:03:42,356
- Diamonds are less valuable than badools.

872
01:03:42,361 --> 01:03:43,756
- The negotiation is over.

873
01:03:43,956 --> 01:03:45,900
- We trust you.
- And under the circumstances.

874
01:03:45,905 --> 01:03:47,100
- We accept the deal.

875
01:03:47,300 --> 01:03:49,746
- Good. Now, take me to Valerian. Now.

876
01:03:49,751 --> 01:03:50,962
- Follow us.
- Follow us.

877
01:03:51,162 --> 01:03:53,461
- Phillips, head to the location where the Major disappeared.

878
01:03:53,661 --> 01:03:56,215
Mylo, track down Agent Laureline and bring her in.

879
01:03:57,115 --> 01:03:58,759
Neza, inform the Minister.

880
01:03:58,763 --> 01:03:59,959
- Yes, sir.

881
01:04:00,159 --> 01:04:01,829
Just give me a few minutes, please.

882
01:04:06,178 --> 01:04:07,185
- Declassify.

883
01:04:07,985 --> 01:04:10,440
I need all information on the planet Mül.

884
01:04:13,340 --> 01:04:15,533
Well, who has authority over this file?

885
01:04:26,332 --> 01:04:28,272
- Here we are.
- Do not like this place.

886
01:04:31,872 --> 01:04:33,309
- Give it to me.
- Uh-huh.

887
01:04:39,709 --> 01:04:42,002
- I've got a bad feeling about this idea of yours.

888
01:04:48,602 --> 01:04:50,286
- Bingo.

889
01:04:54,236 --> 01:04:55,603
- What do you want?

890
01:04:55,803 --> 01:04:57,875
- We'd like to go fishing.
- For a cortex jellyfish.

891
01:04:57,885 --> 01:04:59,282
- Male, if possible.

892
01:05:03,182 --> 01:05:04,660
- Ah, it's not the season.

893
01:05:04,860 --> 01:05:05,860
- Here.

894
01:05:08,660 --> 01:05:10,766
- Males are harder to catch.
- And here.

895
01:05:13,766 --> 01:05:15,048
- Welcome aboard.

896
01:05:21,048 --> 01:05:23,933
- Uh, the thing, down.

897
01:05:24,133 --> 01:05:25,860
- Down, the thing! 
- This one?

898
01:05:26,060 --> 01:05:27,520
- Down. Ay.

899
01:05:38,754 --> 01:05:41,124
- There. Bromosaurs.

900
01:05:47,624 --> 01:05:49,461
- Are they dangerous?
- Not really.

901
01:05:49,724 --> 01:05:51,595
You just have to be careful they don't inhale you.

902
01:06:04,495 --> 01:06:06,638
There. That one is a male.

903
01:06:12,138 --> 01:06:13,462
- How can you tell?

904
01:06:13,562 --> 01:06:16,063
- Oh, they're much smaller than the females.

905
01:06:28,963 --> 01:06:30,757
- How do you know that that one has a jellyfish on it?

906
01:06:30,957 --> 01:06:34,449
- All males do. The Bromosaurs blow out pure water

907
01:06:34,649 --> 01:06:36,800
which the jellyfish can't do without.

908
01:06:36,806 --> 01:06:39,138
That's why they live on them. All year round.

909
01:06:39,144 --> 01:06:42,420
That's where they get their hypersensitivity from.

910
01:06:48,310 --> 01:06:52,265
Soft as silk.

911
01:06:52,275 --> 01:06:54,053
- Can I help? I'm a good driver.

912
01:06:54,056 --> 01:06:55,867
- Shhh!

913
01:06:58,558 --> 01:07:00,940
Mmm, Mmm, Ahh.

914
01:07:13,270 --> 01:07:14,795
- Seat belt.
- What?

915
01:07:28,495 --> 01:07:29,900
- Seat belt!

916
01:07:31,000 --> 01:07:32,598
- I thought you said they weren't aggressive.

917
01:07:32,798 --> 01:07:34,901
- Except when you take their little buddy.

918
01:07:34,907 --> 01:07:36,301
- Great.

919
01:08:07,554 --> 01:08:09,214
- I'm Bob, by the way.

920
01:08:10,214 --> 01:08:11,414
- Hi.

921
01:08:16,214 --> 01:08:17,319
- There's no time to lose.

922
01:08:17,329 --> 01:08:19,520
- The cortex jellyfish is extremely fragile.

923
01:08:19,720 --> 01:08:21,283
- Show it images of Valerian.

924
01:08:21,483 --> 01:08:22,942
- And it will show you what it has seen.

925
01:08:23,142 --> 01:08:25,059
- Sure, but how?

926
01:08:25,064 --> 01:08:26,189
- You have to put it.
- On your head.

927
01:08:26,194 --> 01:08:27,389
- Down to your shoulders.

928
01:08:27,589 --> 01:08:29,625
- You're kidding.
- Never when we're working.

929
01:08:29,631 --> 01:08:31,735
- Through a kind of osmosis.
- You'll be able to communicate.

930
01:08:31,935 --> 01:08:33,399
- But be very careful.
- Not to stay under there.

931
01:08:33,402 --> 01:08:35,573
- Longer than a minute.
- Because then, it starts to feed.

932
01:08:35,576 --> 01:08:36,997
- On your memory.

933
01:08:37,197 --> 01:08:38,787
- Great.

934
01:08:39,287 --> 01:08:41,061
- Anything else I should know

935
01:08:41,065 --> 01:08:43,464
before I voluntarily stick my head on his mouth?

936
01:08:43,504 --> 01:08:45,049
Actually, it's not his mouth.

937
01:08:45,054 --> 01:08:46,510
- You can begin.
- Good luck.

938
01:08:51,110 --> 01:08:52,396
- Don't forget.
- One minute.

939
01:08:52,400 --> 01:08:53,746
- Not a second more.

940
01:08:56,550 --> 01:08:57,721
- I knew I had it in here somewhere.

941
01:08:57,726 --> 01:08:58,890
- Ah.
- There we are.

942
01:09:00,990 --> 01:09:02,890
- Pee-yew.

943
01:09:05,890 --> 01:09:07,345
- Ah.
- There we go.

944
01:09:08,845 --> 01:09:10,158
- This is so exciting.

945
01:09:11,558 --> 01:09:12,817
Valerian?

946
01:09:18,017 --> 01:09:19,490
I only work with my partner.

947
01:09:20,390 --> 01:09:21,744
Valerian, answer me.

948
01:09:24,444 --> 01:09:25,998
What can I do to make it up to you?

949
01:09:32,598 --> 01:09:33,883
- 30 seconds.

950
01:09:34,083 --> 01:09:35,464
Valerian, answer me.

951
01:09:35,864 --> 01:09:37,102
Take that.

952
01:09:41,580 --> 01:09:43,428
Laureline! I'm loosing control!

953
01:09:45,128 --> 01:09:46,308
Valerian!

954
01:09:49,308 --> 01:09:50,753
Valerian! Laureline!

955
01:09:50,853 --> 01:09:51,862
- 40 seconds!

956
01:09:53,562 --> 01:09:54,646
Valerian!

957
01:10:01,746 --> 01:10:02,895
- 50 seconds!

958
01:10:03,095 --> 01:10:04,095
- Get out!
- Now!

959
01:10:04,097 --> 01:10:05,092
- 55 seconds!

960
01:10:06,092 --> 01:10:07,373
Valerian!

961
01:10:08,773 --> 01:10:09,877
Valerian!

962
01:10:12,777 --> 01:10:14,096
Valerian!

963
01:10:16,696 --> 01:10:17,844
- Careful!

964
01:10:18,244 --> 01:10:19,394
- Incredible!

965
01:10:19,594 --> 01:10:21,142
- One minute!
- And ten seconds!

966
01:10:21,342 --> 01:10:22,525
- A record!

967
01:10:26,225 --> 01:10:27,388
- Okay.

968
01:10:28,688 --> 01:10:31,610
L.-630.-E.

969
01:10:31,810 --> 01:10:35,272
S.U.L- DEACTIVATED.

970
01:10:35,472 --> 01:10:37,208
Any idea what that means, guys?

971
01:10:37,408 --> 01:10:40,155
- Level 630 east.
- Most likely a self bay pod.

972
01:10:40,355 --> 01:10:41,491
- Deactivated, apparently.

973
01:10:41,691 --> 01:10:44,384
Okay, okay, thanks.

974
01:10:44,584 --> 01:10:46,345
- You need a detailed map?
- You need a detailed map?

975
01:10:47,832 --> 01:10:50,332
- We biologically traced Sergeant Laureline to here.

976
01:10:50,532 --> 01:10:52,224
- What's she doing out by the Galana Sea?

977
01:10:52,424 --> 01:10:53,548
- No idea, sir.

978
01:10:53,748 --> 01:10:55,296
- She stole a vehicle.

979
01:10:55,496 --> 01:10:56,764
She headed into the Red Zone.

980
01:10:56,964 --> 01:10:58,429
And we lost track of her.

981
01:11:00,229 --> 01:11:02,090
She must've located the Major.

982
01:11:02,290 --> 01:11:04,013
- General, there are 3 civilians here

983
01:11:04,016 --> 01:11:06,152
who claim to have information that might interest you.

984
01:11:06,352 --> 01:11:07,532
- Show them in.

985
01:11:11,932 --> 01:11:13,397
- It's you three.

986
01:11:14,197 --> 01:11:16,119
- Our humble respects, General.

987
01:11:16,124 --> 01:11:17,574
- May you be healthy.
- And prosperous.

988
01:11:17,579 --> 01:11:18,969
- What do you want?

989
01:11:18,974 --> 01:11:20,420
- We have information of the utmost importance.

990
01:11:20,620 --> 01:11:22,569
- That we're ready to sell.
- 100 badools.

991
01:11:22,579 --> 01:11:23,829
- Each!
- Each!

992
01:11:24,629 --> 01:11:25,959
- Shoot.

993
01:11:37,725 --> 01:11:39,149
- Valerian!

994
01:11:48,249 --> 01:11:49,658
Move, lizard.

995
01:12:00,192 --> 01:12:01,523
Valerian?

996
01:12:01,623 --> 01:12:03,036
Valerian, do you hear me?

997
01:12:07,336 --> 01:12:08,737
Valerian, wake up.

998
01:12:09,137 --> 01:12:10,467
Valerian, please.

999
01:12:10,667 --> 01:12:12,120
Stay with me, Valerian.

1000
01:12:12,124 --> 01:12:13,420
Come on, come on.

1001
01:12:24,920 --> 01:12:26,479
- What are you doing here?

1002
01:12:26,484 --> 01:12:27,932
- I came to get you.

1003
01:12:28,132 --> 01:12:29,723
You totaled your Skyjet, remember?

1004
01:12:30,623 --> 01:12:31,732
- Yeah.

1005
01:12:33,633 --> 01:12:34,813
I've lost it in the curve.

1006
01:12:35,013 --> 01:12:37,274
- You mean, you almost died. You're lucky I found you.

1007
01:12:37,474 --> 01:12:38,980
- What about the Commander. Do we know where he is?

1008
01:12:38,984 --> 01:12:40,270
- There's no sign of him.

1009
01:12:40,280 --> 01:12:42,188
Their spaceship went into a Red Zone.

1010
01:12:43,270 --> 01:12:44,581
- We gotta find him.

1011
01:12:45,081 --> 01:12:46,882
- Let's go.
- Wait.

1012
01:12:50,882 --> 01:12:52,115
Is that all?

1013
01:12:52,124 --> 01:12:53,315
- What do you mean?

1014
01:12:53,319 --> 01:12:54,908
- No «Thank you»? No «Well done»?

1015
01:12:55,608 --> 01:12:57,282
- I would've done the same for you.

1016
01:13:03,490 --> 01:13:04,698
- You little prick!

1017
01:13:04,702 --> 01:13:06,476
- Whoa, hey, hey, hey! Chill!

1018
01:13:06,776 --> 01:13:08,388
- I trusted you more than I trusted myself...

1019
01:13:08,392 --> 01:13:09,588
Isn't that what you wanted?

1020
01:13:09,592 --> 01:13:10,706
- No.

1021
01:13:10,906 --> 01:13:13,022
- You are an amazing woman, Laureline.

1022
01:13:13,522 --> 01:13:15,278
It's no wonder I wanna marry you.

1023
01:13:15,478 --> 01:13:17,518
- Why would I wanna marry an ungrateful, conceited...

1024
01:13:17,522 --> 01:13:19,097
- Because you can't live without him.

1025
01:13:20,057 --> 01:13:22,484
I mean look, whenever he wanders off, you go chasing after him.

1026
01:13:25,084 --> 01:13:27,494
- I was just doing my job, Major.

1027
01:13:27,694 --> 01:13:30,083
Now, will you please let me get back to the mission?

1028
01:13:30,283 --> 01:13:32,324
- Yeah... sure.

1029
01:13:32,524 --> 01:13:34,692
- Good.
- Sergeant.

1030
01:13:41,765 --> 01:13:42,951
- Captain, what's going on here?

1031
01:13:43,151 --> 01:13:45,177
- I report directly to the Commander Arun Filitt...

1032
01:13:45,181 --> 01:13:47,067
- I am General Okto-Bar!

1033
01:13:47,077 --> 01:13:49,902
In the absence of the Commander, I am in command on Alpha.

1034
01:13:50,002 --> 01:13:51,668
Arrest this man.

1035
01:13:52,530 --> 01:13:53,814
Now, release that one.

1036
01:13:58,714 --> 01:14:00,777
I apologize for your mistreatment.

1037
01:14:00,977 --> 01:14:02,491
We will take you to a jail,

1038
01:14:02,496 --> 01:14:04,274
but our doctors will take care of you.

1039
01:14:07,900 --> 01:14:09,359
- Help us.

1040
01:14:10,359 --> 01:14:11,913
- If you need my help,

1041
01:14:12,918 --> 01:14:14,734
you have to tell me everything you know.

1042
01:14:16,134 --> 01:14:18,170
But first of all, why are you attacking us?

1043
01:14:18,570 --> 01:14:20,029
- Because you have...

1044
01:14:21,129 --> 01:14:23,544
...what we need.

1045
01:14:36,850 --> 01:14:38,328
- Didn't you say that the girl in your dream

1046
01:14:38,332 --> 01:14:40,370
had a converter just like mine?

1047
01:14:40,375 --> 01:14:41,345
- That's right.

1048
01:14:41,350 --> 01:14:42,920
So, if the animals are native on their planet,

1049
01:14:42,924 --> 01:14:45,325
then surely it's understandable that they want to retrieve

1050
01:14:45,330 --> 01:14:46,525
the last living specimen.

1051
01:14:46,529 --> 01:14:48,197
- Yeah, and they probably kidnapped the Commander

1052
01:14:48,201 --> 01:14:49,701
because they thought he was carrying it.

1053
01:14:49,705 --> 01:14:51,040
- Yeah, once they find out he's not,

1054
01:14:51,044 --> 01:14:52,328
then I'll be at the top of their list.

1055
01:14:52,432 --> 01:14:54,798
- Don't worry, I'm not letting you go anywhere.

1056
01:14:54,802 --> 01:14:56,749
- No, I'm not letting you go anywhere.

1057
01:15:14,770 --> 01:15:16,396
- Pretty butterfly.

1058
01:15:16,400 --> 01:15:17,980
- Sure, but whatever you do, don't touch 'em.

1059
01:15:18,984 --> 01:15:21,099
- Why?
- Because some of them are...

1060
01:15:22,124 --> 01:15:23,246
- No!

1061
01:15:23,650 --> 01:15:24,862
- Valerian!

1062
01:15:26,066 --> 01:15:27,448
- Laureline!

1063
01:15:28,352 --> 01:15:29,713
I'm coming!

1064
01:15:55,747 --> 01:15:57,940
- Let me go, fatty. Come on, put me down!

1065
01:16:01,244 --> 01:16:02,703
- Sorry, I'm inedible.

1066
01:16:04,507 --> 01:16:05,746
- Valerian!

1067
01:16:12,850 --> 01:16:14,675
Major, I can read your signal now.

1068
01:16:15,079 --> 01:16:16,083
- Valerian!

1069
01:16:29,687 --> 01:16:31,044
- Alex, any ideas?

1070
01:16:31,048 --> 01:16:33,513
The only way to get in without creating a

1071
01:16:33,517 --> 01:16:36,554
a severe diplomatic incident is to pass for one of them.

1072
01:16:36,558 --> 01:16:39,483
I suggest you try to find a Glamopod.

1073
01:16:41,387 --> 01:16:42,718
- Thanks, Alex.

1074
01:16:53,022 --> 01:16:54,578
- Have you run a DNA search?

1075
01:16:54,582 --> 01:16:56,481
- Yes.

1076
01:16:56,485 --> 01:16:58,819
- But it didn't match any of the 800 million species

1077
01:16:58,823 --> 01:17:00,092
we have in our database.

1078
01:17:00,096 --> 01:17:01,375
- Well, how is that possible?

1079
01:17:01,379 --> 01:17:03,568
- Either it belongs to a completely unknown species...

1080
01:17:03,572 --> 01:17:04,826
- Or?

1081
01:17:04,830 --> 01:17:07,585
- Or their species was deliberately deleted from the database.

1082
01:17:10,589 --> 01:17:11,870
- General,

1083
01:17:11,874 --> 01:17:14,555
the Major has resurfaced at the edge of the Red Zone.

1084
01:17:14,559 --> 01:17:16,138
- Which district is he in?

1085
01:17:16,142 --> 01:17:17,142
- Paradise Alley.

1086
01:17:19,846 --> 01:17:21,444
- Notify all units.

1087
01:17:24,848 --> 01:17:26,229
All units: Search Alert.

1088
01:17:26,233 --> 01:17:28,523
Major Valerian. Not dangerous.

1089
01:17:28,527 --> 01:17:30,391
Find and assist.

1090
01:17:31,895 --> 01:17:33,200
- Can I help you?

1091
01:17:33,204 --> 01:17:34,984
- Sure, you can. Move.

1092
01:17:37,988 --> 01:17:41,073
- Good. Now slide your gun into my holster.

1093
01:17:43,077 --> 01:17:44,256
Hold still.

1094
01:17:48,012 --> 01:17:49,900
It tastes its desires...

1095
01:17:50,502 --> 01:17:52,091

Come on, out! You pervert!

Hey! Cowboy!

1124
01:18:48,140 --> 01:18:49,400
You've come to the right spot.

1125
01:18:49,404 --> 01:18:51,512
This is the best damn club on the whole Space Station.

1126
01:18:51,516 --> 01:18:54,001
- Hey, Jolly!
- I'll be with you in a second.

1127
01:18:54,605 --> 01:18:57,065
I'm looking for something special.

1128
01:18:57,069 --> 01:18:59,535
Well, of course you are. Whatever it is you want,

1129
01:18:59,539 --> 01:19:01,121
I got it!

1130
01:19:01,525 --> 01:19:03,012
I'm not so sure...

1131
01:19:03,016 --> 01:19:04,406
Tell me. What is it you want?

1132
01:19:04,410 --> 01:19:05,456
What you looking for?

1133
01:19:05,460 --> 01:19:06,709
A Glamopod.

1134
01:19:06,713 --> 01:19:08,046
You are so lucky.

1135
01:19:08,050 --> 01:19:11,093
I got the best one in the whole universe. Come on.

1136
01:19:11,248 --> 01:19:14,001
- Jolly!
- Just...

1137
01:19:14,105 --> 01:19:15,273
Come on.

1138
01:19:27,212 --> 01:19:29,696
Hey, I work for the government.

1139
01:19:33,686 --> 01:19:35,485
If you wanna avoid a diplomatic incident,

1140
01:19:35,489 --> 01:19:37,317
you better let me go right now!

1141
01:19:41,521 --> 01:19:44,444
Look, listen, I didn't come here to get a makeover.

1142
01:19:44,448 --> 01:19:47,042
I need to leave. Do you understand?

1143
01:19:52,749 --> 01:19:54,204
I can't believe it.

1144
01:19:54,208 --> 01:19:56,597
I'm not here to try on a stupid dress!

1145
01:19:56,601 --> 01:19:59,798
Call your chief or a translator so we can at least communicate.

1146
01:20:01,402 --> 01:20:04,489
Do you understand what I am saying?

1147
01:20:16,793 --> 01:20:17,828
Okay.

1148
01:20:23,039 --> 01:20:25,877
This is where you lose the hardware, soldier boy.

1149
01:20:25,881 --> 01:20:28,379
Oh, I'd rather hold on to it. I'm on duty.

1150
01:20:28,383 --> 01:20:30,332
Yeah, well, unfortunately, rules are rules

1151
01:20:30,336 --> 01:20:33,054
and this is a place where we make love, not war.

1152
01:20:36,258 --> 01:20:37,645
Here's your ticket.

1153
01:20:38,549 --> 01:20:39,827
Don't lose it.

1154
01:20:40,831 --> 01:20:42,258
Could we make a deal?

1155
01:20:42,262 --> 01:20:44,717
Let's not talk about business.

1156
01:20:44,721 --> 01:20:47,430
Can we just talk pleasure?

1157
01:20:47,434 --> 01:20:48,969
What kinda music you into, huh?

1158
01:20:48,973 --> 01:20:51,972
You like Techno?, Macro?, Bio?, Nano?

1159
01:20:51,976 --> 01:20:53,849
- I'm more Retro.
- Ah, me too.

1160
01:20:53,853 --> 01:20:55,045
Oldies are goodies.

1161
01:20:56,292 --> 01:20:58,740
Sit down. Relax.

1162
01:20:58,744 --> 01:21:01,324

But not exactly what I'm looking for right now.

1216
01:23:51,813 --> 01:23:53,638
Well, I have a whole lot more in stock

1217

if you just tell me what you have in mind.

1218
01:23:54,946 --> 01:23:56,086
I have a lot in mind.

1219
01:23:56,090 --> 01:23:58,403
And no time for this. I'll pass.

1220
01:24:00,019 --> 01:24:01,967
Listen, I have a problem and I really need your help.

1221
01:24:01,971 --> 01:24:03,465
You didn't like my performance?

1222
01:24:03,469 --> 01:24:06,957
No, no, yeah, I... I loved it.

1223
01:24:06,961 --> 01:24:08,342
Absolutely!

1224
01:24:08,346 --> 01:24:09,725
I started at age four.

1225
01:24:10,329 --> 01:24:12,420
Learning my trade in all the top schools.

1226
01:24:12,424 --> 01:24:14,905
I can play anyone or anything.

1227
01:24:14,909 --> 01:24:16,007
I'm sure you can.

1228
01:24:16,011 --> 01:24:18,036
I know all of Shakespeare by heart, if you want.

1229
01:24:18,040 --> 01:24:20,240
Poetry, maybe? You like poetry?

1230
01:24:20,244 --> 01:24:21,036
Uh, sure.

1231
01:24:21,140 --> 01:24:22,718
Rimbaud? Valerian?

1232
01:24:22,722 --> 01:24:23,624
Tough choice.

1233
01:24:29,369 --> 01:24:30,761
"I'm afraid of a kiss"

1234
01:24:34,301 --> 01:24:35,918
"Like the kiss of a bee"

1235
01:24:36,922 --> 01:24:38,672
"I suffer like this"

1236
01:24:40,076 --> 01:24:41,776
"And wake endlessly"

1237
01:24:43,780 --> 01:24:45,508
"I'm afraid of a kiss"

1238
01:24:52,012 --> 01:24:54,469
How 'bout I tell you
what I really have in mind?

1239
01:24:56,373 --> 01:24:57,789
Quit screaming!

1240
01:24:57,893 --> 01:24:59,263
Where'd you get a gun?

1241
01:25:02,267 --> 01:25:04,071
Major Valerian!

1242
01:25:04,075 --> 01:25:06,112
I advise you to put that gun down!

1243
01:25:07,016 --> 01:25:09,121
And I advise you to sit down.

1244
01:25:09,125 --> 01:25:11,254
Okay, okay, okay.

1245
01:25:11,258 --> 01:25:13,173
Please, no, don't shoot me!

1246
01:25:13,177 --> 01:25:14,291
What the hell is that?

1247
01:25:14,295 --> 01:25:15,799
That is you when you were ten.

1248
01:25:15,803 --> 01:25:17,931
You're not going to shoot yourself, are you?

1249
01:25:17,935 --> 01:25:19,505
Will you go back to normal, please?

1250
01:25:19,509 --> 01:25:20,681
Okay, okay.

1251
01:25:21,805 --> 01:25:24,776
No, not... this normal. The other one.

1252
01:25:24,780 --> 01:25:26,149
Okay, okay.

1253
01:25:28,553 --> 01:25:29,941
Thank you.

1254
01:25:29,945 --> 01:25:31,029
What's your name?

1255
01:25:31,033 --> 01:25:32,643
Whatever you want it to be, sweetie.

1256
01:25:32,647 --> 01:25:33,850
I don't have time for your games, sweetie.

1257
01:25:33,854 --> 01:25:35,560
Come on, tell me what's your name.

1258
01:25:39,364 --> 01:25:40,576
Bubble.

1259
01:25:41,480 --> 01:25:43,285
Look, Bubble, I lost my partner.

1260
01:25:43,289 --> 01:25:45,389
If you help me find her, I'll set you free.

1261
01:25:46,895 --> 01:25:48,423
What good is freedom when you're an

1262
01:25:48,427 --> 01:25:50,287
illegal immigrant far away from home?

1263
01:25:50,291 --> 01:25:51,582
I work for the government, okay?

1264
01:25:51,586 --> 01:25:53,601
You have an ID pass. You have my word.

1265
01:25:56,605 --> 01:25:58,538
If I leave, Jolly will kill me.

1266
01:25:58,542 --> 01:26:00,549
No, Jolly won't kill anybody ever again.

1267
01:26:05,353 --> 01:26:06,891
So, what do you say,

1268
01:26:07,395 --> 01:26:08,709
Bubble?

1269
01:26:09,513 --> 01:26:11,783
You really liked my performance?

1270
01:26:12,087 --> 01:26:13,903
Best I ever saw.

1271
01:26:18,807 --> 01:26:20,114
Thank you.

1272
01:26:20,218 --> 01:26:21,656
You're welcome.

1273
01:26:25,956 --> 01:26:27,038
Hm-hm.

1274
01:26:27,460 --> 01:26:29,844
So, ugh, I'm gonna take ten.

1275
01:26:29,848 --> 01:26:32,664
You two keep an eye on old soldier boy, huh?

1276
01:26:32,668 --> 01:26:35,133
He seems like a real freak to me.

1277
01:26:39,137 --> 01:26:41,133
Okay, Bubble, get off me.

1278
01:26:41,137 --> 01:26:43,239
All right, all right, I'm doing this.

1279
01:26:48,243 --> 01:26:49,854
Hey, you good?

1280
01:26:50,558 --> 01:26:51,963
Thanks.

1281
01:26:56,167 --> 01:26:57,739
You wanna go in there?

1282
01:26:57,743 --> 01:26:59,282
Yeah, but no foreigners are allowed.

1283
01:26:59,286 --> 01:27:01,088
The only way in is to look like one of them.

1284
01:27:01,352 --> 01:27:02,744
Oh, no, no, no!

1285
01:27:02,748 --> 01:27:04,211
I've never played a Boulan-Bathor before!

1286
01:27:04,215 --> 01:27:05,992
What? Are you an artist or not?

1287
01:27:05,996 --> 01:27:08,835
Yes, but, I need time to get into my role, and

1288
01:27:08,839 --> 01:27:11,512
capture my movements and behaviors, and

1289
01:27:11,516 --> 01:27:13,763
character's arc, we do a couple rehearsals,

1290
01:27:13,767 --> 01:27:15,020
you give me some notes...

1291
01:27:15,024 --> 01:27:16,692
Well, a little improve never hurt anyone.

1292
01:27:16,696 --> 01:27:17,975
- Let's go.

1293
01:27:19,979 --> 01:27:21,312
- All right.

1294
01:27:22,216 --> 01:27:23,556
- Turn around.

1295
01:27:30,760 --> 01:27:32,024
Ugh.

1296
01:27:32,028 --> 01:27:34,010
- This is not right.

1297
01:27:34,714 --> 01:27:36,157
- I need a manicure.

1298
01:27:42,634 --> 01:27:46,323
- Don't you think the hat might be a little bit over-the-top?

1299
01:27:48,527 --> 01:27:50,087
- Never mind.

1300
01:27:53,460 --> 01:27:55,596
- Hey, hey, hey! What are you doing?

1301
01:27:55,600 --> 01:27:57,636
- Give me a second to get the hang of it.

1302
01:27:57,640 --> 01:27:59,718
- Hurry, people are staring at us.

1303
01:27:59,722 --> 01:28:01,430
I told you I needed rehearsals.

1304
01:28:01,434 --> 01:28:03,093
This is a heavy role.

1305
01:28:03,897 --> 01:28:06,186
- Much better. You're doing good.

1306
01:28:10,990 --> 01:28:12,218
- General,

1307
01:28:12,876 --> 01:28:14,741
we picked up the Major's trail again.

1308
01:28:15,145 --> 01:28:16,775
- Finally. Where is he?

1309
01:28:17,279 --> 01:28:19,038
- In Boulan-Bathor territory.

1310
01:28:19,342 --> 01:28:21,705
- In the Bou... What...?

1311
01:28:21,710 --> 01:28:23,292
Nobody gets in there.

1312
01:28:23,296 --> 01:28:25,004
- And definitely not out of there.

1313
01:28:27,201 --> 01:28:29,589
- We need reinforcements. Inform the Minister.

1314
01:28:29,593 --> 01:28:30,540
- Yes, sir.

1315
01:28:40,125 --> 01:28:41,748
- So, how did you come to lose your partner?

1316
01:28:41,752 --> 01:28:43,657
- Because I'm stupid.
- What do you mean?

1317
01:28:43,661 --> 01:28:45,165
All I do is flirt and joke.

1318
01:28:45,169 --> 01:28:47,178
- Oh, trying to be cool rather than being honest.

1319
01:28:47,182 --> 01:28:48,255
- Story of my life.

1320
01:28:48,259 --> 01:28:50,344
How young were you when you lost your mom?

1321
01:28:50,348 --> 01:28:51,611
- Please don't go there right now.

1322
01:28:51,615 --> 01:28:53,461
- It's okay to be vulnerable sometimes.

1323
01:28:53,465 --> 01:28:55,457
- Can we stop this and go back to the mission, please?

1324
01:28:55,461 --> 01:28:56,802
And don't touch anything!

1325
01:28:56,806 --> 01:28:58,971
- Well, it wouldn't hurt you to show some weakness.

1326
01:28:58,975 --> 01:29:00,133
- I'm not good at that.

1327
01:29:00,137 --> 01:29:01,641
- It will make her feel important.

1328
01:29:01,645 --> 01:29:02,813
- Yeah, believe me,

1329
01:29:02,817 --> 01:29:04,847
she's already the most important thing in my life.

1330
01:29:11,751 --> 01:29:13,616
I think he wants us to join the group.

1331
01:29:13,720 --> 01:29:15,495
Uh, I'm not sure that's a good idea.

1332
01:29:15,599 --> 01:29:18,148
It doesn't look like he's giving us much choice.

1333
01:29:31,552 --> 01:29:33,006
- What's going on?

1334
01:29:33,010 --> 01:29:36,004
I guess it's lunchtime for Emperor Boulan III.

1335
01:29:46,338 --> 01:29:49,996
Ugh. Bussing tables? Every artist's worst nightmare.

1336
01:29:50,000 --> 01:29:52,025
Never mention this to anyone, okay?

1337
01:29:52,029 --> 01:29:54,059
Thank your lucky stars we're not the main course.

1338
01:30:12,363 --> 01:30:13,764
I'm gonna be sick.

1339
01:30:35,168 --> 01:30:36,773
There she is!

1340
01:30:37,077 --> 01:30:38,956
Wow, you're right. She's a 10.

1341
01:31:06,660 --> 01:31:07,892
Hi.

1342
01:31:19,996 --> 01:31:21,406
Something's wrong.

1343
01:31:21,410 --> 01:31:23,363
How 'bout I do a little dance to create a diversion?

1344
01:31:23,367 --> 01:31:24,586
No, thanks.

1345
01:31:35,190 --> 01:31:36,995
You guys are in big trouble!

1346
01:31:36,999 --> 01:31:38,124
I think we should go.

1347
01:31:38,128 --> 01:31:39,666
I think you should let me handle this.

1348
01:31:42,170 --> 01:31:43,852
Valerian!

1349
01:31:43,856 --> 01:31:45,021
I'm in here!

1350
01:32:07,125 --> 01:32:08,371
Hey!

1351
01:32:10,853 --> 01:32:12,627
You're gonna be a good boy, okay?

1352
01:32:12,631 --> 01:32:14,542
Down. Stay.

1353
01:32:14,546 --> 01:32:16,720
Laureline, it's me, Valerian.

1354
01:32:16,724 --> 01:32:17,891
What?

1355
01:32:25,095 --> 01:32:26,851
Bubble, get off me.

1356
01:32:26,855 --> 01:32:28,448
Yes, you're right. Let's go! Whoo!

1357
01:32:28,952 --> 01:32:31,021
Ah, excuse me, your highness.

1358
01:32:39,325 --> 01:32:41,044
Hey, baby.

1359
01:32:48,348 --> 01:32:49,811
I deserve that.

1360
01:32:54,011 --> 01:32:55,092
Watch out!

1361
01:32:56,515 --> 01:32:58,418
This is a lady. You can't fight her.

1362
01:33:08,316 --> 01:33:10,931
Let's talk about this. You're gonna hurt yourself.

1363
01:33:11,935 --> 01:33:13,818
I warned you.

1364
01:33:33,922 --> 01:33:35,743
Well, that's what I call a partner.

1365
01:33:36,047 --> 01:33:37,194
Woo-hoo!

1366
01:33:37,998 --> 01:33:40,630
Bravo! That was amazing.

1367
01:33:40,634 --> 01:33:42,530
I'm very impressed!

1368
01:33:44,134 --> 01:33:45,401
Hey.

1369
01:33:46,005 --> 01:33:47,373
Hey.

1370
01:34:01,377 --> 01:34:02,533
Trust me on this.

1371
01:34:29,387 --> 01:34:30,736
3rd Regiment approaching, sir.

1372
01:34:31,740 --> 01:34:34,113
- Any news from our agents?
- None.

1373
01:34:35,476 --> 01:34:37,163
And the Commander, any ransom demands?

1374
01:34:37,167 --> 01:34:39,708
Negative. Minister online.

1375
01:34:39,712 --> 01:34:40,745
Okay.

1376
01:34:43,700 --> 01:34:45,491
- My respects, Minister.
- General.

1377
01:34:45,495 --> 01:34:47,342
You've been authorized by the Council

1378
01:34:47,346 --> 01:34:48,994
to assume command of this operation.

1379
01:34:48,998 --> 01:34:50,807
- Congratulations.
- Thank you, sir.

1380
01:34:50,811 --> 01:34:52,272
But to fulfill my mission,

1381
01:34:52,276 --> 01:34:54,834
I will need full access to Commander Filitt's data.

1382
01:34:54,838 --> 01:34:56,758
According to regulations,

1383
01:34:56,762 --> 01:34:59,978
that isn't possible without his explicit agreement.

1384
01:34:59,982 --> 01:35:01,148
The Commander may well be dead.

1385
01:35:02,252 --> 01:35:04,608
If I am to succeed in my new assignment,

1386
01:35:04,612 --> 01:35:07,171
I need to know everything.

1387
01:35:10,591 --> 01:35:11,980
Access granted.

1388
01:35:11,984 --> 01:35:13,200
Thank you, sir.

1389
01:35:18,604 --> 01:35:19,911
Declassify.

1390
01:35:22,615 --> 01:35:24,304
Request file on the planet Mül.

1391
01:35:24,508 --> 01:35:26,127
Request authorized.

1392
01:35:28,631 --> 01:35:30,462
Huh, the conflict with the southern territories.

1393
01:35:32,266 --> 01:35:35,881
The war against Arysum-Kormn led to the destruction of planet Mül.

1394
01:35:36,985 --> 01:35:38,477
Tell me more about the planet.

1395
01:35:39,081 --> 01:35:40,589
The planet was uninhabited.

1396
01:35:42,393 --> 01:35:44,183
Who's in charge of this operation?

1397
01:35:48,387 --> 01:35:50,022
This does not smell good.

1398
01:36:09,376 --> 01:36:10,918
I told you there was a door.

1399
01:36:10,922 --> 01:36:12,337
Someone didn't look over the plans

1400
01:36:12,341 --> 01:36:13,671
before they came rushing in.

1401
01:36:13,675 --> 01:36:14,970
As usual.

1402
01:36:14,974 --> 01:36:16,721
You'd rather I show up after the main event?

1403
01:36:16,725 --> 01:36:20,950
I'd rather you took me someplace other than a giant trash can.

1404
01:36:21,154 --> 01:36:22,523
Bubble?

1405
01:36:25,127 --> 01:36:26,727
Bubble, where are you?

1406
01:36:27,231 --> 01:36:29,486
- Where is she?
- She was right behind us.

1407
01:36:29,790 --> 01:36:30,898
I'm here.

1408
01:36:37,402 --> 01:36:38,755
What's wrong?

1409
01:36:38,759 --> 01:36:40,959
I must've been injured during the fight.

1410
01:36:41,163 --> 01:36:44,214
Bubble, tell me what to do.

1411
01:36:45,953 --> 01:36:47,746
Nothing you could do.

1412
01:36:48,350 --> 01:36:50,242
Anyway, where I'm from...

1413
01:36:50,546 --> 01:36:52,862
Life is more painful than death.

1414
01:36:52,866 --> 01:36:54,244
Don't say that.

1415
01:36:54,948 --> 01:36:57,022
Unfortunately, it's true.

1416
01:36:58,826 --> 01:37:02,427
It's a drag when you don't have an identity to call your own.

1417
01:37:02,831 --> 01:37:04,655
You do have an identity.

1418
01:37:05,959 --> 01:37:08,447
You're the greatest artist I've ever seen.

1419
01:37:12,951 --> 01:37:14,279
I thank you.

1420
01:37:20,983 --> 01:37:23,198
It was my pleasure performing for you.

1421
01:37:25,202 --> 01:37:26,666
I leave you my kingdom.

1422
01:37:27,870 --> 01:37:29,474
Take good care of it.

1423
01:37:29,678 --> 01:37:31,047
I will.

1424
01:37:31,651 --> 01:37:34,545
- But most importantly...
- Yeah?

1425
01:37:34,949 --> 01:37:36,714
Take good care of her.

1426
01:37:41,018 --> 01:37:42,654
Love her without measure.

1427
01:37:43,258 --> 01:37:47,097
"There's beggary in love that can be reckoned."

1428
01:38:11,101 --> 01:38:12,384
Let's go.

1429
01:38:29,917 --> 01:38:31,670
All the battleships have docked, General.

1430
01:38:31,674 --> 01:38:34,445
Good. I want Section One operative as soon as possible.

1431
01:38:34,449 --> 01:38:36,032
What are these K-Tron doing there?

1432
01:38:37,462 --> 01:38:38,921
The Commander programmed them personally.

1433
01:38:38,925 --> 01:38:40,673
They can't be deactivated.

1434
01:38:40,977 --> 01:38:43,968
Great. That's all we need.

1435
01:38:50,872 --> 01:38:52,722
Do you have any idea where we're going?

1436
01:38:52,726 --> 01:38:54,645
Yeah, sure, I mean...

1437
01:38:54,649 --> 01:38:59,599
- I guess...
- You're sure, or you guess?

1438
01:38:59,603 --> 01:39:02,204
Look, I know it sounds strange, but it...

1439
01:39:02,208 --> 01:39:06,282
The Princess... she's guiding me.

1440
01:39:06,286 --> 01:39:09,689
The Princess? She's guiding you?

1441
01:39:09,693 --> 01:39:13,112
Yeah, the... Look, it's hard to explain, but...

1442
01:39:13,116 --> 01:39:17,600
It's like she's... been with me the whole time.

1443
01:39:18,004 --> 01:39:19,282
Wait.

1444
01:39:20,205 --> 01:39:22,842
You mean to tell me that you've had a woman

1445
01:39:23,046 --> 01:39:26,776
inside of you since the beginning?

1446
01:39:27,180 --> 01:39:29,462
Laureline, can we just keep going, please?

1447
01:39:29,466 --> 01:39:30,642
Sure.

1448
01:39:31,246 --> 01:39:32,815
Ladies first.

1449
01:39:33,119 --> 01:39:34,732
Ha. Hilarious.

1450
01:39:40,236 --> 01:39:42,657
- What you doin'?
- Villainy, villainy!

1451
01:39:45,415 --> 01:39:47,892
Captain Kris. Section One operational, General.

1452
01:39:47,896 --> 01:39:50,838
Proceed. A unit of K-Trons will join you.

1453
01:39:51,200 --> 01:39:53,716
- That won't be necessary.
- Commander's orders.

1454
01:39:53,720 --> 01:39:55,142
Not mine.

1455
01:39:55,446 --> 01:39:57,671
Copy that. Move on.

1456
01:40:15,575 --> 01:40:17,567
We've been manipulated from the start.

1457
01:40:17,571 --> 01:40:18,654
What do you mean?

1458
01:40:18,658 --> 01:40:19,701
We're in the middle of the dead zone

1459
01:40:19,705 --> 01:40:21,127
and we can breathe properly.

1460
01:40:21,631 --> 01:40:23,883
It seems there's no sign of contamination.

1461
01:40:27,701 --> 01:40:29,505
The Commander's fully aware of what's behind this

1462
01:40:29,509 --> 01:40:31,437
so-called absolute evil.

1463
01:40:32,541 --> 01:40:33,890
What?

1464
01:40:39,694 --> 01:40:41,079
Pearls.

1465
01:40:41,483 --> 01:40:44,691
My name is Tsûuri. I am the Emperor's son.

1466
01:40:44,695 --> 01:40:46,808
Great, how about you introduce us to daddy?

1467
01:40:46,812 --> 01:40:48,223
He is expecting you.

1468
01:40:50,478 --> 01:40:53,117
Try to contact the General. Get everyone down here.

1469
01:40:53,121 --> 01:40:54,456
I'll buy us some time.

1470
01:40:54,875 --> 01:40:57,688
How about you run for back up for a change?

1471
01:41:03,192 --> 01:41:04,667
Unbelievable.

1472
01:41:31,471 --> 01:41:32,862
Follow me.

1473
01:42:13,506 --> 01:42:15,702
I'd like you to meet my father.

1474
01:42:15,706 --> 01:42:17,246
The Emperor.

1475
01:42:28,050 --> 01:42:29,551
My name is Haban-Limaï

1476
01:42:29,555 --> 01:42:32,304
And this is my wife, Aloï

1477
01:42:34,308 --> 01:42:36,280
We're pleased to welcome you here.

1478
01:42:36,284 --> 01:42:39,526
My son sensed the presence of his sister,

1479
01:42:39,530 --> 01:42:42,342
Princess Lïho-Minaa in you.

1480
01:42:45,941 --> 01:42:48,083
It seems she chose you.

1481
01:42:49,287 --> 01:42:50,756
What do you mean?

1482
01:42:54,260 --> 01:42:55,832
At the moment of passing,

1483
01:42:55,836 --> 01:42:59,095
Pearls release all the energy left in their body

1484
01:42:59,099 --> 01:43:00,924
in the form of a wave

1485
01:43:00,928 --> 01:43:03,389
which travels through space and time.

1486
01:43:03,393 --> 01:43:05,665
Sometimes, it finds a benevolent host.

1487
01:43:05,669 --> 01:43:08,128
Lïho-Minaa chose you

1488
01:43:08,132 --> 01:43:10,971
to be the guardian of her soul.

1489
01:43:13,775 --> 01:43:15,143
Told you.

1490
01:43:24,047 --> 01:43:25,518
My daughter.

1491
01:43:30,622 --> 01:43:33,082
I'm so happy to see you.

1492
01:43:33,386 --> 01:43:34,679
Same here.

1493
01:43:34,683 --> 01:43:39,426
I mean... she is, too.

1494
01:43:43,291 --> 01:43:46,708
What exactly happened to you and your people?

1495
01:43:47,012 --> 01:43:49,632
Our planet was a true paradise

1496
01:43:49,636 --> 01:43:51,598
on which we lived in harmony

1497
01:43:51,602 --> 01:43:52,810
with the elements.

1498
01:43:53,714 --> 01:43:56,263
Our main activity was fishing for the pearls.

1499
01:43:56,367 --> 01:43:58,725
who possessed phenomenal energy.

1500
01:43:58,929 --> 01:44:00,729
They fertilized our lands.

1501
01:44:00,933 --> 01:44:02,681
Controlled the winds and tides.

1502
01:44:02,885 --> 01:44:05,569
Three time a year, we gave to the earth.

1503
01:44:05,673 --> 01:44:07,560
What the sea has given us.

1504
01:44:07,764 --> 01:44:09,770
We lived like this in harmony

1505
01:44:10,074 --> 01:44:12,316
for centuries and centuries.

1506
01:44:14,400 --> 01:44:16,420
Until the day of the apocalypse.

1507
01:44:19,924 --> 01:44:22,169
In the sky, over our planet

1508
01:44:22,173 --> 01:44:26,039
other people blindly fought out a brutal war.

1509
01:44:26,143 --> 01:44:29,252
A war between people we didn't even know.

1510
01:45:16,402 --> 01:45:17,746
Missiles loaded, sir.

1511
01:45:17,750 --> 01:45:19,643
Engage fusion missiles.

1512
01:45:21,047 --> 01:45:22,725
Do you confirm, sir?

1513
01:45:23,329 --> 01:45:25,310
Yes, I do.

1514
01:45:26,714 --> 01:45:28,176
At your command.

1515
01:45:33,180 --> 01:45:34,975
By the grace of God.

1516
01:46:00,879 --> 01:46:02,470
Your daughter died during the battle.

1517
01:46:02,574 --> 01:46:05,274
Yes, like six million others.

1518
01:46:09,878 --> 01:46:11,652
What happened after the explosion?

1519
01:46:11,856 --> 01:46:14,441
We drifted in space for many years.

1520
01:46:15,145 --> 01:46:17,560
Aboard a vessel we salvaged from the wreckage.

1521
01:46:17,764 --> 01:46:20,115
And that was half-destroyed.

1522
01:46:23,407 --> 01:46:25,993
Come back to your room.

1523
01:46:26,319 --> 01:46:29,890
This new environment was quite different from ours.

1524
01:46:29,894 --> 01:46:33,280
And at first, we needed time to understand it.

1525
01:46:33,484 --> 01:46:37,692
Absorbing the vast knowledge stored in its database.

1526
01:46:45,996 --> 01:46:48,958
We learned languages and mathematics.

1527
01:46:49,662 --> 01:46:53,423
Physics, chemistry, and philosophy.

1528
01:46:55,227 --> 01:46:58,174
We learned about the millions of planets and stars

1529
01:46:58,178 --> 01:47:01,811
and moons in a universe we never knew existed.

1530
01:47:04,115 --> 01:47:08,309
And we learned of the countless species who inhabit this universe.

1531
01:47:09,213 --> 01:47:13,811
Including humans, the ones who destroyed our planet.

1532
01:47:14,348 --> 01:47:15,548
Thank you.

1533
01:47:15,815 --> 01:47:19,103
Time has not dimmed the memories of our loss.

1534
01:47:19,907 --> 01:47:22,528
But it has allowed us to let go of our anger

1535
01:47:22,532 --> 01:47:24,777
toward those responsible.

1536
01:47:28,088 --> 01:47:31,043
Hey! Look.

1537
01:47:31,181 --> 01:47:35,295
Then one day, we were picked up by scrap dealers

1538
01:47:35,300 --> 01:47:37,129
travelling the galaxy.

1539
01:47:37,673 --> 01:47:39,711
After a few years, their hold was full.

1540
01:47:44,075 --> 01:47:45,507
And they went off to sell their cargo

1541
01:47:45,511 --> 01:47:47,521
on a huge construction site.

1542
01:47:50,020 --> 01:47:52,236
- Alpha.
- Yes.

1543
01:47:52,640 --> 01:47:55,016
The City of a Thousand Planets.

1544
01:47:55,220 --> 01:47:56,827
Where for hundreds of years,

1545
01:47:56,831 --> 01:47:59,699
so many species have shared their knowledge

1546
01:47:59,703 --> 01:48:02,363
and intelligence with each other.

1547
01:48:03,667 --> 01:48:06,668
In the shadows of Alpha, we lived undetected.

1548
01:48:06,672 --> 01:48:10,241
All the while watching and learning from each of them.

1549
01:48:14,100 --> 01:48:16,211
Until we acquired both the knowledge

1550
01:48:16,215 --> 01:48:19,466
and the materials to build a vessel of our own.

1551
01:48:32,170 --> 01:48:34,021
Our planet is gone forever.

1552
01:48:34,225 --> 01:48:35,697
But with what we have learned

1553
01:48:35,701 --> 01:48:40,054
we are now able to replicate and restore our lost world.

1554
01:48:41,658 --> 01:48:42,885
Amazing.

1555
01:48:42,889 --> 01:48:44,613
There are only two things that we lack.

1556
01:48:44,917 --> 01:48:46,476
A Mül converter.

1557
01:48:47,080 --> 01:48:48,350
And the pearl.

1558
01:48:48,754 --> 01:48:51,930
The only one Tsûuri managed to salvage.

1559
01:49:07,934 --> 01:49:09,914
We are survivors.

1560
01:49:10,018 --> 01:49:11,677
But that makes us witnesses.

1561
01:49:11,981 --> 01:49:14,725
Witnesses of a past humans want to erase

1562
01:49:14,829 --> 01:49:16,839
and forget forever.

1563
01:49:17,343 --> 01:49:22,137
We can forgive, but how can we forget?

1564
01:49:22,741 --> 01:49:25,761
So, we left you no choice but to steal the converter.

1565
01:49:25,799 --> 01:49:27,938
And Tsûuri hired a professional.

1566
01:49:27,942 --> 01:49:29,266
Igon Siruss.

1567
01:49:31,670 --> 01:49:34,317
Then Major Valerian intervenes and retrieves the converter.

1568
01:49:34,321 --> 01:49:35,873
Which left you with only one choice,

1569
01:49:35,877 --> 01:49:38,448
kidnap the Commander, force him to tell you the truth.

1570
01:49:38,452 --> 01:49:40,165
You know our story now.

1571
01:49:40,669 --> 01:49:43,385
Our destiny is in your hands.

1572
01:49:59,800 --> 01:50:01,094
Major,

1573
01:50:01,098 --> 01:50:03,512
arrest these creatures immediately.

1574
01:50:04,016 --> 01:50:06,144
They kidnapped me. They're extremely dangerous.

1575
01:50:06,148 --> 01:50:08,583
They're Pearls from the planet Mül.

1576
01:50:08,587 --> 01:50:11,116
I heard their ridiculous story. That's impossible.

1577
01:50:11,320 --> 01:50:13,079
Mül was uninhabited.

1578
01:50:13,083 --> 01:50:15,786
Their existence proves the contrary, doesn't it?

1579
01:50:15,790 --> 01:50:18,197
I am telling you, there was no life on the planet.

1580
01:50:18,201 --> 01:50:19,901
The detectors were categorical.

1581
01:50:19,905 --> 01:50:21,036
Arrest them.

1582
01:50:21,040 --> 01:50:22,360
How can you be so sure?

1583
01:50:22,364 --> 01:50:24,961
Because... I write the reports and...

1584
01:50:24,965 --> 01:50:26,184
And you were on board.

1585
01:50:29,088 --> 01:50:31,421
Yes. Yes, I was on board.

1586
01:50:32,825 --> 01:50:35,221
And we had much more serious things to worry about.

1587
01:50:36,125 --> 01:50:37,884
Our cruisers were being decimated.

1588
01:50:37,888 --> 01:50:40,561
We lost 500,000 soldiers in a day.

1589
01:50:41,165 --> 01:50:43,098
It was complete carnage!

1590
01:50:43,102 --> 01:50:45,889
You were so preoccupied, you didn't see the detectors

1591
01:50:45,893 --> 01:50:47,763
indicating signs of life on the planet.

1592
01:50:47,767 --> 01:50:51,076
Or even worse, perhaps you knew that planet was inhabited

1593
01:50:51,080 --> 01:50:52,975
and you sacrificed it.

1594
01:50:53,579 --> 01:50:55,323
Commander, the planet is inhabited.

1595
01:50:55,327 --> 01:50:57,330
By primitive lifeforms.

1596
01:50:57,334 --> 01:50:58,420
No, Commander.

1597
01:50:58,424 --> 01:51:01,872
I've detected a complex language and huge cerebral energy.

1598
01:51:01,876 --> 01:51:03,107
Major.

1599
01:51:03,116 --> 01:51:05,528
History is on the march.

1600
01:51:05,532 --> 01:51:07,587
And neither you nor a bunch of savages

1601
01:51:07,591 --> 01:51:09,491
are gonna stand in its way.

1602
01:51:11,302 --> 01:51:13,873
So, when you realized survivors from planet Mül

1603
01:51:13,877 --> 01:51:15,054
were living in the heart of Alpha,

1604
01:51:15,058 --> 01:51:17,917
you decided to erase any trace of your mistake.

1605
01:51:18,921 --> 01:51:21,386
Rather than accept the consequences.

1606
01:51:22,390 --> 01:51:24,517
I want no survivors.

1607
01:51:25,121 --> 01:51:28,065
And you destroyed all the evidence Major Samk had against you.

1608
01:51:38,019 --> 01:51:40,232
What did you expect me to do?!

1609
01:51:40,736 --> 01:51:42,269
It was the only way!

1610
01:51:48,182 --> 01:51:50,074
Admitting to an error on this scale

1611
01:51:50,078 --> 01:51:52,281
would've exposed our government to colossal damages

1612
01:51:52,285 --> 01:51:53,464
and compensation claims.

1613
01:51:53,468 --> 01:51:55,089
Our economy would never recover.

1614
01:51:55,093 --> 01:51:57,543
In one instance, we would've lost

1615
01:51:57,547 --> 01:51:58,971
our supremacy and our leadership.

1616
01:51:58,975 --> 01:52:01,134
There would've been immediate sanctions.

1617
01:52:01,138 --> 01:52:02,637
And it's a pretty good bet

1618
01:52:02,641 --> 01:52:03,847
that we would've been banished from Alpha.

1619
01:52:03,851 --> 01:52:05,257
And denied access to the greatest

1620
01:52:05,261 --> 01:52:06,972
market of knowledge and intelligence.

1621
01:52:06,976 --> 01:52:10,387
Is that what you would've wanted for your fellow citizens?

1622
01:52:11,691 --> 01:52:14,262
Leading them into ruin and degradation?

1623
01:52:14,266 --> 01:52:17,279
Forcing them to go backwards 1,000 years?

1624
01:52:17,283 --> 01:52:22,899
Our council saw fit to protect our citizens first and foremost.

1625
01:52:22,903 --> 01:52:24,026
Is that not its duty?

1626
01:52:24,030 --> 01:52:25,619
And mine?

1627
01:52:25,623 --> 01:52:27,113
And yours?!

1628
01:52:34,112 --> 01:52:35,622
Or would you rather risk

1629
01:52:35,626 --> 01:52:38,677
wrecking our economy for the sake of a bunch of...

1630
01:52:38,681 --> 01:52:39,973
Savages?

1631
01:52:39,977 --> 01:52:42,793
You are totally under the influence of these creatures.

1632
01:52:42,797 --> 01:52:44,687
Do not confuse the issue.

1633
01:52:44,691 --> 01:52:46,143
He's the threat.

1634
01:52:46,147 --> 01:52:47,889
He's the enemy.

1635
01:52:55,100 --> 01:52:58,809
You are your own worst enemy, Commander.

1636
01:52:59,313 --> 01:53:01,638
Unless you make peace with your past,

1637
01:53:02,342 --> 01:53:03,956
you won't have a future.

1638
01:53:10,756 --> 01:53:12,357
Major,

1639
01:53:12,361 --> 01:53:15,359
I order you to arrest this man.

1640
01:53:16,563 --> 01:53:18,839
Can we talk man-to-man for a second?

1641
01:53:22,814 --> 01:53:24,215
Major, what are you doing?

1642
01:53:26,482 --> 01:53:28,087
I taught him how to do that.

1643
01:53:30,091 --> 01:53:31,219
Nice talk.

1644
01:53:37,403 --> 01:53:38,879
Move on, move on, move on.

1645
01:53:45,460 --> 01:53:47,691
Section One is entering the Red Zone.

1646
01:53:47,695 --> 01:53:49,707
Prepare Section Two for an advance also.

1647
01:53:49,711 --> 01:53:51,528
Look, this was a lot of fun

1648
01:53:51,532 --> 01:53:53,533
but we gotta report back to our people.

1649
01:53:54,237 --> 01:53:56,474
Here, that's yours.

1650
01:53:56,478 --> 01:53:59,514
I'm gonna make this right. I promise.

1651
01:54:00,289 --> 01:54:01,088
Let's get this guy...

1652
01:54:01,092 --> 01:54:02,281
Whoa, whoa, whoa, what are you doing?

1653
01:54:02,285 --> 01:54:03,898
I'm giving them back the converter.

1654
01:54:04,402 --> 01:54:05,609
No.

1655
01:54:05,613 --> 01:54:06,934
The pearl is useless without this.

1656
01:54:06,938 --> 01:54:07,776
Yeah, but...

1657
01:54:08,580 --> 01:54:12,054
- Will you give us a second, please?
- What?

1658
01:54:13,884 --> 01:54:15,829
That converter is government property.

1659
01:54:15,833 --> 01:54:17,986
Most likely the last one in the whole universe.

1660
01:54:17,990 --> 01:54:20,283
Oh, so, you buy into the Commander's

1661
01:54:20,287 --> 01:54:23,281
what's mine is mine and what's yours is mine philosophy?

1662
01:54:23,285 --> 01:54:24,983
No, I buy into my oath of allegiance.

1663
01:54:24,987 --> 01:54:26,549
We have no authority to hand it over.

1664
01:54:26,553 --> 01:54:28,834
The Federation messed up and must make amends.

1665
01:54:28,838 --> 01:54:31,000
Yeah, I agree, but that's not for us to decide.

1666
01:54:31,004 --> 01:54:32,797
Leave it to the courts.

1667
01:54:32,801 --> 01:54:34,586
They're 18 light-years away, Valerian.

1668
01:54:34,590 --> 01:54:36,056
Only we can make this right.

1669
01:54:37,160 --> 01:54:38,932
Laureline, I'm a soldier.

1670
01:54:39,336 --> 01:54:40,816
I play by the rules.

1671
01:54:41,420 --> 01:54:43,391
It's what makes me who I am.

1672
01:54:49,815 --> 01:54:52,275
You see...

1673
01:54:52,279 --> 01:54:54,200
That's why I don't wanna marry you

1674
01:54:54,204 --> 01:54:56,362
because you really don't know what love is.

1675
01:54:56,366 --> 01:54:58,408
Oh, come on, this has nothing to do with love.

1676
01:54:58,412 --> 01:55:00,069
That's where you're wrong.

1677
01:55:00,973 --> 01:55:04,460
Love is more powerful than anything else, Valerian.

1678
01:55:04,864 --> 01:55:07,553
It breaks all rules and laws.

1679
01:55:07,557 --> 01:55:09,833
And overpowers any army or government.

1680
01:55:10,337 --> 01:55:11,895
Just look at her.

1681
01:55:12,699 --> 01:55:15,921
For one second, put yourself in her position.

1682
01:55:15,925 --> 01:55:18,355
She lost all of her people and her child.

1683
01:55:18,359 --> 01:55:20,560
And she's willing to forgive.

1684
01:55:20,564 --> 01:55:22,902
That's real love.

1685
01:55:22,906 --> 01:55:26,442
It's the trust you place in someone else, and

1686
01:55:26,446 --> 01:55:29,311
I thought I could be that someone else for you.

1687
01:55:29,785 --> 01:55:32,977
- But clearly...
- You can.

1688
01:55:34,681 --> 01:55:36,137
You are.

1689
01:55:37,141 --> 01:55:39,085
I'd die for you.

1690
01:55:39,089 --> 01:55:41,925
I'm not asking you to die for me.

1691
01:55:43,802 --> 01:55:46,082
I'm asking you to trust me.

1692
01:56:07,056 --> 01:56:09,166
All right. Give it to 'em.

1693
01:56:14,470 --> 01:56:15,955
Thank you.

1694
01:56:25,988 --> 01:56:28,511
We are to blame for the loss of your planet.

1695
01:56:28,515 --> 01:56:31,117
And we'd be honored to help you get it back.

1696
01:56:33,056 --> 01:56:34,358
Here.

1697
01:56:47,854 --> 01:56:49,233
It means 'thank you'.

1698
01:56:58,537 --> 01:57:00,373
Spread out!. Spread out!.

1699
01:57:25,577 --> 01:57:26,977
Captain, we're locked on to you.

1700
01:57:27,481 --> 01:57:29,453
Any sign of contamination or radiation?

1701
01:57:29,457 --> 01:57:30,824
Zero trace of either.

1702
01:57:32,028 --> 01:57:33,776
It doesn't make any sense.

1703
01:59:05,247 --> 01:59:06,940
Didn't you say you wanted to go to the beach?

1704
01:59:13,144 --> 01:59:14,835
Our daughter made a good choice.

1705
01:59:16,139 --> 01:59:17,905
She can rest in peace now.

1706
01:59:26,309 --> 01:59:27,960
We must leave now.

1707
01:59:27,964 --> 01:59:29,804
May you and your people live in peace

1708
01:59:29,814 --> 01:59:32,754
wherever you may venture in space and time.

1709
01:59:44,715 --> 01:59:46,532
Explosives in place, General. We're operational.

1710
01:59:46,536 --> 01:59:49,144
Received. Evacuate the zone.

1711
01:59:49,148 --> 01:59:50,205
You have four minutes.

1712
01:59:52,209 --> 01:59:53,651
Copy that.

1713
01:59:57,055 --> 02:00:00,743
Father, there are hundreds of soldiers all around the spaceship.

1714
02:00:00,747 --> 02:00:02,123
We will be gone in a miunte.

1715
02:00:02,127 --> 02:00:03,664
The troops are in position, you don't have a minute.

1716
02:00:03,668 --> 02:00:05,877
You have no means of communication to the outside world?

1717
02:00:05,881 --> 02:00:07,890
If we stop jamming signals, we are defenseless.

1718
02:00:07,894 --> 02:00:09,463
If you don't allow me to communicate with them,

1719
02:00:09,467 --> 02:00:10,828
you'll be defenseless forever.

1720
02:00:17,032 --> 02:00:18,394
Just one call.

1721
02:00:21,698 --> 02:00:23,557
- Disarm the signal.
- Thank you.

1722
02:00:30,061 --> 02:00:31,520
The walls stopped moving.

1723
02:00:31,924 --> 02:00:33,279
Something's going on.

1724
02:00:33,283 --> 02:00:36,253
Maintain your position. We're analyzing the data.

1725
02:00:37,657 --> 02:00:39,253
I can't believe they'd do that.

1726
02:00:39,257 --> 02:00:40,656
The General would follow procedure.

1727
02:00:40,660 --> 02:00:42,080
Yeah, I hate procedure.

1728
02:00:42,684 --> 02:00:44,295
Captain, the data shows that they've built

1729
02:00:44,299 --> 02:00:46,039
some kind of vessel beyond the wall.

1730
02:00:52,042 --> 02:00:53,422
Contact with the enemy.

1731
02:00:55,026 --> 02:00:56,720
Give me a physical description.

1732
02:00:56,724 --> 02:00:58,768
Same creatures who kidnapped the Commander.

1733
02:01:04,672 --> 02:01:06,571
Are they showing any signs of hostility?

1734
02:01:10,675 --> 02:01:12,006
Not really.

1735
02:01:13,910 --> 02:01:15,621
- Are they armed?
- No.

1736
02:01:20,153 --> 02:01:23,722
General, we're picking up a signal from the 2005 Destiny module.

1737
02:01:23,726 --> 02:01:24,877
What?

1738
02:01:24,881 --> 02:01:26,586
Sounds like Major Valerian.

1739
02:01:30,290 --> 02:01:31,550
Patch him through.

1740
02:01:31,554 --> 02:01:33,209
Major, you're online with the General.

1741
02:01:33,213 --> 02:01:34,559
- Major.
- Yeah.

1742
02:01:34,563 --> 02:01:35,702
Major Valerian and Sergeant Laureline

1743
02:01:35,706 --> 02:01:37,350
We're alive and on the inside of the wall.

1744
02:01:37,354 --> 02:01:38,812
Call off the assault immediately.

1745
02:01:38,816 --> 02:01:41,788
Major, I can't read your DNA codes. You know the procedure.

1746
02:01:41,792 --> 02:01:43,048
I have to be certain it's you.

1747
02:01:43,052 --> 02:01:44,677
There is no time for dumbass procedures.

1748
02:01:44,681 --> 02:01:46,734
We are here with a whole species of people

1749
02:01:46,738 --> 02:01:48,171
you've already wiped out once.

1750
02:01:48,175 --> 02:01:49,491
The Pearls of Planet Mül.

1751
02:01:49,495 --> 02:01:51,193
So, tell your men to back off

1752
02:01:51,197 --> 02:01:52,908
before you commit a second genocide!

1753
02:01:52,912 --> 02:01:54,309
That's definitely her temper.

1754
02:01:54,313 --> 02:01:56,037
Planet Mül was uninhabited.

1755
02:01:56,041 --> 02:01:57,706
Come on, you know that's not true.

1756
02:01:57,710 --> 02:01:58,926
The Commander was there.

1757
02:01:58,930 --> 02:02:00,533
He gave the orders.

1758
02:02:00,537 --> 02:02:02,014
And then he organized this whole procedure

1759
02:02:02,018 --> 02:02:03,462
to eliminate any survivors.

1760
02:02:03,466 --> 02:02:05,556
The living proof of his mistake.

1761
02:02:05,560 --> 02:02:06,921
Stop the procedure.

1762
02:02:06,925 --> 02:02:08,332
Maybe that'll explain why the Commander

1763
02:02:08,336 --> 02:02:10,089
was interrogating that creature.

1764
02:02:15,493 --> 02:02:16,976
-Is the Commander with you?

1765
02:02:21,039 --> 02:02:22,109
Come on.

1766
02:02:22,113 --> 02:02:23,508
Woky-wooky.

1767
02:02:24,612 --> 02:02:26,512
- You're gonna call.
- What?

1768
02:02:26,516 --> 02:02:27,573
Ow!

1769
02:02:28,677 --> 02:02:31,028
Let's go, my friend. Time to confess.

1770
02:02:31,032 --> 02:02:33,351
Hello?

1771
02:02:33,355 --> 02:02:36,186
No DNA code. But voice waves match.

1772
02:02:36,390 --> 02:02:38,921
This is General Okto-Bar. Do you read me, Commander?

1773
02:02:40,725 --> 02:02:42,253
What's going on?

1774
02:02:42,257 --> 02:02:44,956
We are ready to activate the explosive device.

1775
02:02:45,360 --> 02:02:47,663
In accordance with the orders you gave.

1776
02:02:48,267 --> 02:02:51,012
Do you confirm those orders?

1777
02:02:51,016 --> 02:02:53,408
Or do you have anything to tell me

1778
02:02:53,812 --> 02:02:56,927
That would enable me to suspend the assault?

1779
02:03:01,131 --> 02:03:02,770
I'm a soldier.

1780
02:03:05,674 --> 02:03:09,400
A soldier will always choose death over humiliation.

1781
02:03:14,404 --> 02:03:16,199
Annihilate them all.

1782
02:03:38,193 --> 02:03:39,819
What the hell are you doing?

1783
02:03:39,823 --> 02:03:41,211
I didn't give the orders!

1784
02:03:41,215 --> 02:03:43,431
Captain, cease fire immediately!

1785
02:03:43,435 --> 02:03:46,042
It's not us, it's the K-Trons. They're shooting at us!

1786
02:03:47,746 --> 02:03:49,146
Come on, you...

1787
02:03:52,950 --> 02:03:54,629
I'm gonna get Tsûuri some back up.

1788
02:03:54,633 --> 02:03:55,832
Keep an eye on him.

1789
02:03:55,836 --> 02:03:57,271
Oh, he's not going anywhere.

1790
02:04:01,575 --> 02:04:03,343
Get down! Take cover!

1791
02:04:05,647 --> 02:04:07,550
Alex, load me up with all you've got.

1792
02:04:07,554 --> 02:04:08,900
- Copy that.
- Thanks.

1793
02:04:26,067 --> 02:04:28,289
Neza, stop this countdown now!

1794
02:04:28,293 --> 02:04:29,293
- Yes, sir.

1795
02:04:51,697 --> 02:04:52,955
Hurry, Neza!

1796
02:05:21,759 --> 02:05:22,984
Hurry, Neza!

1797
02:05:37,288 --> 02:05:38,683
How much time left?

1798
02:05:38,787 --> 02:05:40,119
Ten seconds!

1799
02:05:43,623 --> 02:05:45,138
- Hurry!

1800
02:06:19,142 --> 02:06:20,432
- Neza...

1801
02:06:28,536 --> 02:06:29,938
... check for survivors.

1802
02:06:55,852 --> 02:06:57,172
- Captain, status report.

1803
02:06:57,676 --> 02:06:59,458
Nothing's left.  Just a gaping hole.

1804
02:07:00,262 --> 02:07:01,797
They left with their spaceship.

1805
02:07:01,801 --> 02:07:03,149
Everything's vanished.

1806
02:07:03,153 --> 02:07:05,671
- And our agents, Valerian and Laureline?

1807
02:07:05,675 --> 02:07:07,524
- No, nothing.
- And the Commander?

1808
02:07:07,528 --> 02:07:08,640
- Anyone there?

1809
02:07:08,644 --> 02:07:10,340
- Wait, I hear something.

1810
02:07:14,944 --> 02:07:16,269
There's a body.

1811
02:07:17,053 --> 02:07:20,015
- Get me down from here, you children!

1812
02:07:21,720 --> 02:07:22,894
- It's the Commander.

1813
02:07:22,898 --> 02:07:24,526
- Is he alive?

1814
02:07:24,530 --> 02:07:25,607
- Affirmative.

1815
02:07:25,611 --> 02:07:26,943
Alive and kicking.

1816
02:07:26,947 --> 02:07:28,147
- Good.

1817
02:07:31,051 --> 02:07:32,207
Arrest him.

1818
02:07:35,211 --> 02:07:36,457
Help!

1819
02:07:54,861 --> 02:07:56,648
Do you have any idea what they left us?

1820
02:07:56,652 --> 02:07:58,767
- We're two hours away from vacation.

1821
02:07:59,071 --> 02:08:00,480
I fired the distress beacons.

1822
02:08:00,484 --> 02:08:02,022
- Two hours?

1823
02:08:02,026 --> 02:08:04,937
- Yeah, I know, two hours alone with me. What a drag.

1824
02:08:04,941 --> 02:08:08,326
- No kidding. It's basically an eternity.

1825
02:08:09,130 --> 02:08:10,171
- Hey...

1826
02:08:12,275 --> 02:08:13,708
Now that our mission's over,

1827
02:08:13,712 --> 02:08:15,617
Maybe we could finish our conversation.

1828
02:08:15,621 --> 02:08:16,952
- What conversation?

1829
02:08:17,156 --> 02:08:18,558
- We were talking about the future.

1830
02:08:19,062 --> 02:08:20,085
- Really?...

1831
02:08:20,089 --> 02:08:22,053
... and what does the future hold?

1832
02:08:26,257 --> 02:08:27,520
You.

1833
02:08:28,424 --> 02:08:29,633
Me.

1834
02:08:29,637 --> 02:08:32,937
Us.

1835
02:08:36,941 --> 02:08:38,312
«Happy birthday.»

1836
02:08:42,216 --> 02:08:43,479
- Thank you, Valerian.

1837
02:08:45,183 --> 02:08:46,569
That is so romantic.

1838
02:08:47,173 --> 02:08:48,955
Did you really think of this yourself?

1839
02:08:49,259 --> 02:08:52,157
- Yeah. You mean so much to me, you know.

1840
02:08:53,161 --> 02:08:54,365
Laureline...

1841
02:08:54,769 --> 02:08:59,005
... will you do me the honor of becoming my wife?

1842
02:09:01,409 --> 02:09:03,015
- For better or worse?

1843
02:09:03,619 --> 02:09:06,717
Uh, worse? Is that negotiable?

1844
02:09:06,721 --> 02:09:07,941
- No.

1845
02:09:09,045 --> 02:09:10,343
- All right, then.

1846
02:09:22,547 --> 02:09:24,275
- Is that a yes?

1847
02:09:24,479 --> 02:09:25,863
- It's a maybe.

1848
02:09:28,067 --> 02:09:30,030
- I'm confused. Is this how love works?

1849
02:09:30,434 --> 02:09:32,459
- No, this is how I work.

1850
02:09:32,563 --> 02:09:34,330
- You spent a day in a woman's body.

1851
02:09:34,334 --> 02:09:35,670
Did you not learn anything?

1852
02:09:35,974 --> 02:09:37,381
- Yeah.

1853
02:09:39,085 --> 02:09:40,457
I did learned something.

1854
02:09:41,061 --> 02:09:42,303
- What?

1855
02:09:43,370 --> 02:09:46,076
- I want only your name on my playlist.

1856
02:09:48,370 --> 02:09:51,076
