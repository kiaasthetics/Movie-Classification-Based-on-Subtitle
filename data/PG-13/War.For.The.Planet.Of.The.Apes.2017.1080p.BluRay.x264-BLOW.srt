1
00:02:56,636 --> 00:02:57,762
Captain!

2
00:03:38,970 --> 00:03:40,480
Is that a trench?

3
00:03:42,473 --> 00:03:44,267
It looks like there's more of them inside.

4
00:03:49,188 --> 00:03:50,816
Echo 2-6 to command.

5
00:03:52,025 --> 00:03:54,319
Colonel, we've got eyes on
three Kong in the north woods.

6
00:03:54,485 --> 00:03:55,528
One of them is armed.

7
00:03:55,653 --> 00:03:57,172
And our donkey
just spotted another trench.

8
00:03:57,196 --> 00:03:58,656
Maybe the base is near.

9
00:03:59,949 --> 00:04:00,992
Yes, sir.

10
00:04:03,661 --> 00:04:05,622
Yes, sir, copy. Over.

11
00:04:10,793 --> 00:04:12,237
Hey, donkey.

12
00:04:18,217 --> 00:04:19,217
Preacher.

13
00:04:24,515 --> 00:04:25,516
The one with the gun.

14
00:04:26,684 --> 00:04:27,873
As soon as the gunner's down,

15
00:04:28,098 --> 00:04:29,269
you guys take out the trench.

16
00:04:29,312 --> 00:04:30,313
Yes, sir.
Yes, sir.

17
00:04:50,416 --> 00:04:51,416
Fire!

18
00:04:58,883 --> 00:05:00,176
Come on!

19
00:06:21,424 --> 00:06:22,433
Reload!

20
00:07:18,815 --> 00:07:20,817
Fall back! Fall back!

21
00:07:43,548 --> 00:07:45,208
Colonel, do you copy?
Colonel!

22
00:07:45,883 --> 00:07:46,917
Who is this?

23
00:07:47,084 --> 00:07:48,319
Preacher, sir!
It's Preacher!

24
00:07:48,386 --> 00:07:50,346
Where are you, soldier?
I need your position.

25
00:07:50,513 --> 00:07:52,323
I don't know!
What do you see?

26
00:07:52,890 --> 00:07:54,267
I can't see anything, sir.

27
00:07:54,433 --> 00:07:56,619
We lost a lot of men,
and the captain is dead, sir.

28
00:07:56,686 --> 00:07:58,871
Okay, calm down.
You're in command now.

29
00:07:59,397 --> 00:08:00,590
Command, sir?

30
00:08:00,857 --> 00:08:02,567
I think it's just me
all by myself now.

31
00:08:02,733 --> 00:08:04,068
Take control.

32
00:08:07,238 --> 00:08:09,232
Colonel, I don't think I'm gonna make it, sir.

33
00:08:09,699 --> 00:08:10,741
I'm sorry.

34
00:08:10,908 --> 00:08:12,034
I'm so sorry, sir.

35
00:08:12,201 --> 00:08:14,921
Listen to me.
You kill as many as you can.

36
00:08:19,917 --> 00:08:22,086
No! No, no!

37
00:09:37,620 --> 00:09:39,538
Sixty-three dead.

38
00:09:45,044 --> 00:09:46,044
You're him.

39
00:09:46,879 --> 00:09:48,130
You're Caesar.

40
00:09:49,799 --> 00:09:51,701
We've been searching for you for so long.

41
00:09:52,635 --> 00:09:54,470
We heard you had
a hidden command base.

42
00:09:54,553 --> 00:09:56,147
But we could never find it.

43
00:09:56,514 --> 00:09:58,808
Some of us started to think
that you might be dead.

44
00:09:58,975 --> 00:10:00,953
But Colonel McCullough said
you were out here somewhere.

45
00:10:00,977 --> 00:10:02,887
Just kill us already.
Shut up, man!

46
00:10:03,053 --> 00:10:04,789
What?
They're animals.

47
00:10:05,255 --> 00:10:06,716
He's gonna slaughter us.

48
00:10:13,739 --> 00:10:18,068
I did not start this war.

49
00:10:19,412 --> 00:10:22,340
The ape who did is dead.

50
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,135
His name was Koba.

51
00:10:27,044 --> 00:10:28,487
I killed him.

52
00:10:30,548 --> 00:10:33,518
Now, I fight only,

53
00:10:33,884 --> 00:10:35,628
to protect apes.

54
00:10:35,894 --> 00:10:36,894
Yeah?

55
00:10:39,056 --> 00:10:40,257
What about him?

56
00:10:41,017 --> 00:10:42,619
We've got 10 more just like him.

57
00:10:44,020 --> 00:10:45,938
I know these apes.

58
00:10:46,897 --> 00:10:48,891
They follow Koba.

59
00:10:50,276 --> 00:10:52,403
They tried to kill me.

60
00:10:53,070 --> 00:10:56,140
They fear what I will do to them.

61
00:10:56,407 --> 00:10:59,836
So now, they serve you.

62
00:11:01,078 --> 00:11:02,446
Just to survive.

63
00:11:04,749 --> 00:11:07,501
I don't fear you.

64
00:11:11,422 --> 00:11:14,225
You must fear.

65
00:11:15,217 --> 00:11:19,063
How long you think
woods can protect you?

66
00:11:19,430 --> 00:11:22,266
Humans destroy you.

67
00:11:23,434 --> 00:11:27,338
Their Kerna has all power.

68
00:11:28,230 --> 00:11:32,134
For them, he more than just human.

69
00:11:34,737 --> 00:11:36,105
He everything.

70
00:11:36,572 --> 00:11:40,493
He say, First Caesar die,

71
00:11:41,786 --> 00:11:44,906
then all of you die.

72
00:11:52,338 --> 00:11:54,548
Winter! Take this traitor outside!

73
00:12:02,014 --> 00:12:03,850
What should we do with the humans?

74
00:12:18,614 --> 00:12:19,890
You're letting us go?

75
00:12:20,783 --> 00:12:23,836
Tell your Colonel you have seen me now,

76
00:12:24,829 --> 00:12:26,989
and I have a message for him.

77
00:12:27,456 --> 00:12:31,469
Leave us the woods,
and the killing can stop.

78
00:12:41,762 --> 00:12:43,699
Do you think they will
give him the message?

79
00:12:45,182 --> 00:12:46,984
They are the message, Maurice.

80
00:12:48,394 --> 00:12:50,921
He will see we are not savages.

81
00:12:59,071 --> 00:13:01,308
The traitor attacked me!
He got away!

82
00:13:29,602 --> 00:13:30,895
Koba,

83
00:13:31,687 --> 00:13:33,030
still haunts us.

84
00:13:35,566 --> 00:13:37,235
Why didn't I see,

85
00:13:37,902 --> 00:13:40,071
that he could not forgive,

86
00:13:40,696 --> 00:13:42,580
what humans did to him?

87
00:13:44,742 --> 00:13:50,556
No one could have known how much
darkness, was living inside him.

88
00:14:25,407 --> 00:14:26,601
Father.

89
00:14:42,925 --> 00:14:44,343
Welcome home, Rocket.

90
00:14:45,010 --> 00:14:47,263
You look tired.

91
00:14:48,264 --> 00:14:49,473
It was a long journey.

92
00:14:49,848 --> 00:14:51,926
Father, we found something!

93
00:14:52,518 --> 00:14:53,544
Come.

94
00:15:20,588 --> 00:15:21,588
Mother.

95
00:15:30,389 --> 00:15:31,389
Cornelius.

96
00:15:32,433 --> 00:15:33,943
Say hi to your brother!

97
00:15:43,235 --> 00:15:44,679
Look who's here son.

98
00:15:56,123 --> 00:15:57,123
Lake.

99
00:16:27,738 --> 00:16:29,140
This is it, father.

100
00:16:30,157 --> 00:16:31,942
We can start over. A new home.

101
00:16:33,535 --> 00:16:35,196
What is beyond those mountains, son?

102
00:16:35,572 --> 00:16:37,123
Show them Rocket.

103
00:16:50,886 --> 00:16:52,096
A desert!

104
00:16:52,513 --> 00:16:54,765
The journey is long.

105
00:16:55,265 --> 00:16:57,701
But that is why humans will not find us.

106
00:16:58,143 --> 00:17:00,771
We must leave tonight!

107
00:17:01,188 --> 00:17:03,282
Tonight? That's impossible!

108
00:17:03,691 --> 00:17:05,109
How long can we wait, Lake?

109
00:17:05,275 --> 00:17:06,852
Soldiers getting closer!

110
00:17:07,444 --> 00:17:08,444
Winter!

111
00:17:16,912 --> 00:17:19,207
Your son's been gone, Caesar.

112
00:17:20,066 --> 00:17:23,528
He doesn't know how hard it's been.

113
00:17:27,089 --> 00:17:29,350
I know you are scared,

114
00:17:30,426 --> 00:17:32,344
We all are.

115
00:17:32,886 --> 00:17:35,848
But we are still planning.

116
00:17:38,475 --> 00:17:39,501
Yes.

117
00:17:40,519 --> 00:17:43,881
We must find a safe way 9:34 AM 07-Apr-18out of the woods.

118
00:17:44,815 --> 00:17:46,992
There were only two of you.

119
00:17:47,359 --> 00:17:49,085
But we are...

120
00:17:49,610 --> 00:17:50,636
many.

121
00:18:01,457 --> 00:18:04,560
We will find a way out of here.

122
00:18:07,504 --> 00:18:09,974
Apes together,

123
00:18:11,550 --> 00:18:12,751
strong.

124
00:19:22,496 --> 00:19:23,580
Stay here, son!

125
00:20:10,544 --> 00:20:11,837
Caesar! What's wrong?

126
00:20:12,629 --> 00:20:13,714
How many on patrol?

127
00:20:14,590 --> 00:20:15,590
Five? Six?

128
00:20:15,799 --> 00:20:16,925
Get them!

129
00:20:17,009 --> 00:20:19,136
Luca, get Rocket too.

130
00:21:12,314 --> 00:21:14,358
Lima four to command.
Colonel, did you...

131
00:21:24,701 --> 00:21:25,702
Rocket!

132
00:21:25,869 --> 00:21:27,245
What happened?

133
00:21:27,496 --> 00:21:29,415
I heard him talking!
The Colonel is here!

134
00:21:31,583 --> 00:21:34,044
99, target acquired.

135
00:21:34,753 --> 00:21:39,383
99, target acquired. Repeat.
King Kong is dead.

136
00:21:39,549 --> 00:21:42,411
Let's go.
I can get out from here.

137
00:23:48,929 --> 00:23:50,030
Caesar.

138
00:23:50,722 --> 00:23:52,474
We can't find Winter!

139
00:23:55,268 --> 00:23:57,864
He was scared!
I think he betrayed us!

140
00:24:03,443 --> 00:24:06,046
Have you found Cornelius yet?

141
00:24:06,870 --> 00:24:07,670
No.

142
00:24:07,864 --> 00:24:09,317
We're still searching.

143
00:24:14,704 --> 00:24:17,907
Let's go look for Caesar's little son.

144
00:24:52,149 --> 00:24:53,176
Cornelius!

145
00:25:01,918 --> 00:25:03,387
You're safe now.

146
00:25:21,813 --> 00:25:22,813
Lake.

147
00:25:24,065 --> 00:25:25,483
You loved my son.

148
00:25:26,443 --> 00:25:28,249
Look after his brother,

149
00:25:28,674 --> 00:25:30,104
until I return.

150
00:25:35,368 --> 00:25:38,772
You're not coming with us to our new home?

151
00:25:39,055 --> 00:25:40,055
No.

152
00:25:44,669 --> 00:25:46,171
Go with Lake.

153
00:26:02,604 --> 00:26:03,797
Caesar!

154
00:26:04,231 --> 00:26:05,749
You're not going after them?

155
00:26:08,276 --> 00:26:10,195
Not them. Him.

156
00:26:10,403 --> 00:26:14,507
Caesar, you are our leader!

157
00:26:14,991 --> 00:26:16,552
We can't leave without you!

158
00:26:17,535 --> 00:26:18,570
You must.

159
00:26:20,163 --> 00:26:22,032
The soldiers will be back soon.

160
00:26:23,399 --> 00:26:24,409
Father!

161
00:26:26,002 --> 00:26:27,304
When I find him,

162
00:26:27,671 --> 00:26:29,647
the soldiers will all come after me.

163
00:26:31,007 --> 00:26:32,759
That may give you the best chance,

164
00:26:32,842 --> 00:26:34,219
to get out of the woods.

165
00:26:37,847 --> 00:26:39,324
Where is he going?

166
00:26:43,645 --> 00:26:45,223
Caesar! Caesar!

167
00:27:35,739 --> 00:27:38,091
The soldiers' camp is always moving.

168
00:27:38,742 --> 00:27:40,869
My guards think they know where it is.

169
00:27:41,119 --> 00:27:42,370
Let me take you.

170
00:27:42,662 --> 00:27:44,998
You need me to back you up!

171
00:27:45,623 --> 00:27:46,658
No.

172
00:27:48,543 --> 00:27:49,711
Please.

173
00:27:50,420 --> 00:27:52,256
I know what it's like,

174
00:27:53,673 --> 00:27:54,758
to lose a son.

175
00:27:56,301 --> 00:27:59,455
I may not make it back.

176
00:28:01,222 --> 00:28:03,617
That's why I'm coming.

177
00:28:03,641 --> 00:28:06,405
To make sure you do.

178
00:28:45,809 --> 00:28:47,619
Guards think soldiers here.

179
00:28:48,353 --> 00:28:50,588
Always fires burning.

180
00:29:04,119 --> 00:29:05,362
No one here.

181
00:29:06,329 --> 00:29:07,739
Search the area.

182
00:29:31,563 --> 00:29:33,048
I'm just gonna put this down.

183
00:30:08,141 --> 00:30:10,018
What's he doing out here alone?

184
00:30:10,518 --> 00:30:12,312
Maybe he's a deserter?

185
00:31:25,260 --> 00:31:26,478
Look around.

186
00:31:30,139 --> 00:31:31,466
Take what you can.

187
00:33:26,047 --> 00:33:27,548
Something wrong with her.

188
00:33:27,715 --> 00:33:29,175
I don't think she can speak.

189
00:33:31,719 --> 00:33:32,829
Come.

190
00:33:51,781 --> 00:33:55,268
She'll die out here alone.

191
00:33:56,619 --> 00:33:58,413
We cannot take her, Maurice.

192
00:34:03,251 --> 00:34:05,128
I understand.

193
00:34:05,712 --> 00:34:08,398
But I cannot leave her.

194
00:35:17,825 --> 00:35:19,853
Did you find the Colonel?

195
00:35:21,662 --> 00:35:22,662
No.

196
00:35:24,165 --> 00:35:25,441
Winter.

197
00:35:40,056 --> 00:35:41,390
Where's the Colonel?

198
00:35:50,900 --> 00:35:52,068
He's gone.

199
00:35:52,443 --> 00:35:53,444
Gone?

200
00:35:55,530 --> 00:35:57,506
He left this morning,

201
00:35:57,990 --> 00:35:59,717
took many men with him.

202
00:36:00,868 --> 00:36:03,579
More soldiers are coming
down from the North.

203
00:36:04,413 --> 00:36:06,415
The Colonel is going to meet them,

204
00:36:07,083 --> 00:36:08,668
at the border.

205
00:36:09,710 --> 00:36:11,000
What border?

206
00:36:11,325 --> 00:36:12,087
Why?

207
00:36:16,717 --> 00:36:18,119
I don't know.

208
00:36:19,220 --> 00:36:21,864
But the rest of us are going tomorrow.

209
00:36:23,850 --> 00:36:26,886
The donkeys think the soldiers 
from the North,

210
00:36:27,645 --> 00:36:31,307
are coming to help finish
off the apes for good.

211
00:36:32,149 --> 00:36:35,069
That day, after the battle on the hill.

212
00:36:35,570 --> 00:36:39,073
The donkey we caught promised me
the Colonel would spare my life.

213
00:36:39,323 --> 00:36:42,743
If I told them where you were hiding.

214
00:36:44,203 --> 00:36:45,514
Forgive me!

215
00:36:51,127 --> 00:36:53,638
My son.

216
00:36:55,506 --> 00:36:56,506
My...

217
00:36:58,527 --> 00:36:59,759
wife...

218
00:37:00,678 --> 00:37:02,138
are dead.

219
00:38:14,710 --> 00:38:16,629
Now what do we do?

220
00:38:17,505 --> 00:38:19,131
Wait till the soldiers go.

221
00:38:20,216 --> 00:38:22,494
Follow them to the Colonel.

222
00:38:56,419 --> 00:38:57,829
Koba!

223
00:38:58,713 --> 00:38:59,889
Ape...

224
00:39:01,257 --> 00:39:04,894
not kill ape.

225
00:39:14,170 --> 00:39:15,839
The soldiers are leaving!

226
00:39:54,643 --> 00:39:56,012
They stopped.

227
00:39:56,812 --> 00:39:57,813
Get down!

228
00:40:10,493 --> 00:40:11,987
What are they shooting at?

229
00:40:14,872 --> 00:40:16,332
I don't know.

230
00:41:39,582 --> 00:41:41,484
Why did they shoot you?

231
00:42:01,687 --> 00:42:03,355
Like her!

232
00:42:04,565 --> 00:42:06,567
He cannot speak!

233
00:42:10,279 --> 00:42:12,790
He will die of those wounds.

234
00:42:23,584 --> 00:42:24,669
Luca.

235
00:42:46,065 --> 00:42:47,600
Where did the soldiers go?

236
00:42:47,983 --> 00:42:49,027
Winter said,

237
00:42:49,852 --> 00:42:52,011
they were going to a border.

238
00:42:52,238 --> 00:42:53,781
Yes, but which way is that?

239
00:46:42,593 --> 00:46:45,596
Bad Ape!

240
00:46:51,226 --> 00:46:53,937
Bad Ape.

241
00:46:56,732 --> 00:46:58,066
Who are you?

242
00:46:58,692 --> 00:47:00,669
What are you doing here?

243
00:47:03,739 --> 00:47:05,574
I don't think he understands.

244
00:47:08,494 --> 00:47:10,120
I don't recognize him.

245
00:47:10,579 --> 00:47:12,114
He's not one of us.

246
00:47:14,416 --> 00:47:15,951
Are you alone here?

247
00:47:36,063 --> 00:47:37,147
Cold?

248
00:47:53,956 --> 00:47:54,998
Cold.

249
00:48:00,629 --> 00:48:02,732
I see girl, I think you human.

250
00:48:03,799 --> 00:48:05,133
But you ape.

251
00:48:05,926 --> 00:48:07,302
Like me.

252
00:48:09,137 --> 00:48:10,339
No, put down.

253
00:48:11,473 --> 00:48:13,108
How long have you been here?

254
00:48:13,275 --> 00:48:14,468
Long time.

255
00:48:14,734 --> 00:48:16,853
Long, long time.

256
00:48:27,614 --> 00:48:28,657
Home.

257
00:48:30,200 --> 00:48:31,493
Old home.

258
00:48:37,207 --> 00:48:39,001
Are there more like you?

259
00:48:39,835 --> 00:48:42,070
More apes from zoo.

260
00:48:42,137 --> 00:48:42,979
Dead.

261
00:48:43,404 --> 00:48:44,588
All dead.

262
00:48:45,048 --> 00:48:46,233
Long time.

263
00:48:46,842 --> 00:48:49,344
Human get sick.

264
00:48:49,678 --> 00:48:52,347
Ape get smart.

265
00:48:53,015 --> 00:48:54,741
Then human kill ape.

266
00:48:55,142 --> 00:48:56,560
But not me.

267
00:48:56,977 --> 00:48:58,120
I run.

268
00:48:59,187 --> 00:49:01,189
You learn to speak.

269
00:49:01,523 --> 00:49:03,692
Listen human.

270
00:49:07,529 --> 00:49:08,972
Bad Ape!

271
00:49:11,325 --> 00:49:12,919
Bad Ape.

272
00:49:13,702 --> 00:49:15,037
No.

273
00:49:15,537 --> 00:49:17,039
No touch.

274
00:49:18,540 --> 00:49:19,975
That's mine.

275
00:49:26,673 --> 00:49:27,758
I'm okay!

276
00:49:37,893 --> 00:49:39,603
Amazing...

277
00:49:39,895 --> 00:49:42,064
Always thought we were the only ones.

278
00:49:42,397 --> 00:49:44,608
Wonder if there are more in the world?

279
00:49:45,150 --> 00:49:46,837
More apes like us.

280
00:49:51,239 --> 00:49:53,450
Eat! Eat.

281
00:49:56,453 --> 00:49:57,954
New friends.

282
00:49:58,413 --> 00:49:59,956
Special day.

283
00:50:04,419 --> 00:50:05,712
Where did you get this?

284
00:50:08,757 --> 00:50:09,925
Bad place.

285
00:50:11,259 --> 00:50:12,936
I find long time ago.

286
00:50:13,003 --> 00:50:15,189
After zoo, I look for food.

287
00:50:15,555 --> 00:50:18,000
I find human zoo.

288
00:50:18,725 --> 00:50:20,110
Zoo for sick.

289
00:50:21,436 --> 00:50:22,696
Big walls.

290
00:50:23,063 --> 00:50:25,941
Sick human climb.

291
00:50:27,109 --> 00:50:29,520
Bad human kill.

292
00:50:30,237 --> 00:50:33,407
And then, all get sick.

293
00:50:33,573 --> 00:50:35,942
All dead now for a long time.

294
00:50:36,451 --> 00:50:37,452
Long time.

295
00:50:37,619 --> 00:50:38,979
Bad humans?

296
00:50:40,856 --> 00:50:42,032
Soldiers?

297
00:50:45,085 --> 00:50:46,336
Soldiers.

298
00:50:46,795 --> 00:50:48,463
A deserted military camp!

299
00:50:48,839 --> 00:50:50,958
On the border!

300
00:50:51,842 --> 00:50:54,138
Maybe the Colonel 
and the troops are going there?

301
00:50:56,972 --> 00:50:57,813
Is it far?

302
00:50:58,238 --> 00:50:59,238
Can you take us?

303
00:50:59,241 --> 00:51:00,534
Human zoo?

304
00:51:01,101 --> 00:51:03,812
No. No, no go back there.

305
00:51:03,836 --> 00:51:04,537
I...

306
00:51:04,938 --> 00:51:06,619
Everyone dead. I come here.

307
00:51:06,620 --> 00:51:08,483
Very safe here.
Never go back.

308
00:51:08,650 --> 00:51:10,152
Please, you must take us!

309
00:51:10,318 --> 00:51:11,446
No! No! No!

310
00:51:11,571 --> 00:51:12,903
No. Cannot take! Cannot take.

311
00:51:13,346 --> 00:51:14,890
Cannot take. No! No!

312
00:51:17,117 --> 00:51:18,426
Look! Look! Look! Look!

313
00:51:18,493 --> 00:51:21,163
More snow. Cannot go.
Must stay.

314
00:51:21,329 --> 00:51:23,290
You eat, you rest.

315
00:51:23,457 --> 00:51:25,300
Stay here with me.

316
00:51:27,544 --> 00:51:29,463
Here, you keep.

317
00:51:32,674 --> 00:51:33,876
She keep.

318
00:52:02,037 --> 00:52:03,371
Who is...

319
00:52:09,419 --> 00:52:10,512
child?

320
00:52:11,880 --> 00:52:13,248
I don't know.

321
00:52:14,716 --> 00:52:15,717
But...

322
00:52:16,342 --> 00:52:18,277
she with you.

323
00:52:20,597 --> 00:52:22,390
She has no one else.

324
00:52:29,189 --> 00:52:32,267
I see you look at her just now.

325
00:52:35,862 --> 00:52:38,406
Look sad.

326
00:52:42,953 --> 00:52:44,921
You have child?

327
00:52:48,250 --> 00:52:49,251
One.

328
00:52:52,087 --> 00:52:54,689
The other was killed by human.

329
00:52:57,217 --> 00:52:58,593
Soldier?

330
00:53:10,785 --> 00:53:11,785
I...

331
00:53:15,610 --> 00:53:16,610
had...

332
00:53:17,363 --> 00:53:18,512
child.

333
00:53:24,786 --> 00:53:27,889
You think you will find him...

334
00:53:30,959 --> 00:53:32,460
at human zoo?

335
00:53:37,924 --> 00:53:39,175
With soldier?

336
00:53:42,846 --> 00:53:44,148
I don't know.

337
00:53:46,975 --> 00:53:48,476
Maybe.

338
00:53:50,812 --> 00:53:51,838
Then...

339
00:53:57,193 --> 00:54:00,388
maybe I take you.

340
00:55:43,425 --> 00:55:44,559
Thirsty.

341
00:55:46,761 --> 00:55:48,013
Thirsty.

342
00:55:51,641 --> 00:55:52,641
Thirsty.

343
00:56:07,782 --> 00:56:09,977
Luca, come.
Let's go closer.

344
00:56:10,744 --> 00:56:11,978
Keep them safe.

345
00:56:18,334 --> 00:56:20,170
What are they doing?

346
00:56:20,295 --> 00:56:21,529
I don't know.

347
00:56:25,759 --> 00:56:28,562
What's that? A patrol?

348
00:56:30,305 --> 00:56:31,681
I don't see riders.

349
00:56:37,145 --> 00:56:38,313
Hold it!

350
00:56:41,316 --> 00:56:42,550
I saw them coming!

351
00:57:14,182 --> 00:57:17,210
At least this time.

352
00:57:18,019 --> 00:57:20,188
I was able to protect you.

353
00:58:31,259 --> 00:58:32,403
Caesar.

354
00:58:35,096 --> 00:58:37,065
This must stop.

355
00:58:37,473 --> 00:58:39,667
It's not too late to join the other apes.

356
00:58:40,602 --> 00:58:42,654
We cannot turn back!

357
00:58:44,105 --> 00:58:45,773
Luca gave his life!

358
00:58:46,316 --> 00:58:47,334
Please.

359
00:58:53,114 --> 00:58:54,490
They must pay.

360
00:59:00,997 --> 00:59:02,157
Now...

361
00:59:03,833 --> 00:59:06,628
you sound like Koba.

362
00:59:13,092 --> 00:59:14,836
It was a mistake bringing you all.

363
00:59:15,303 --> 00:59:16,779
This is my fight.

364
00:59:18,097 --> 00:59:19,582
I will finish this alone.

365
00:59:21,351 --> 00:59:22,352
Go.

366
00:59:22,518 --> 00:59:23,545
Now!

367
00:59:24,437 --> 00:59:26,005
Join the others.

368
01:00:53,609 --> 01:00:56,638
What happened?

369
01:00:58,406 --> 01:01:01,676
They came out of nowhere.

370
01:01:02,577 --> 01:01:03,970
Attacked us.

371
01:01:05,621 --> 01:01:07,540
We thought they would kill us all.

372
01:01:07,957 --> 01:01:10,209
But the Colonel stopped them!

373
01:01:12,253 --> 01:01:15,346
There was madness in his eyes!

374
01:01:16,547 --> 01:01:19,426
He said they would use us,
before we died!

375
01:01:19,594 --> 01:01:21,546
And they brought us all here!

376
01:01:23,598 --> 01:01:24,891
Use you?

377
01:01:26,934 --> 01:01:29,496
They've been forcing us to work!

378
01:01:31,105 --> 01:01:32,106
What.

379
01:01:32,940 --> 01:01:34,476
What kind of work?

380
01:01:37,570 --> 01:01:38,638
Wait.

381
01:01:38,905 --> 01:01:40,807
My little son. Is he here?

382
01:01:52,001 --> 01:01:55,088
Grant and Lee.

383
01:01:59,133 --> 01:02:00,310
Wellington...

384
01:02:02,804 --> 01:02:04,472
and Napoleon.

385
01:02:07,141 --> 01:02:08,351
Custer...

386
01:02:10,645 --> 01:02:12,280
and Sitting Bull.

387
01:02:15,274 --> 01:02:17,510
You're probably not much of a reader.

388
01:02:19,153 --> 01:02:22,023
But this is a big moment.

389
01:02:23,491 --> 01:02:24,759
Where were you?

390
01:02:26,327 --> 01:02:29,164
We came upon your herd.
We got lucky.

391
01:02:30,665 --> 01:02:33,234
But I was surprised you weren't with them.

392
01:02:34,669 --> 01:02:36,003
Hey, hey, hey!

393
01:02:44,887 --> 01:02:48,182
I hope you don't come
to regret sparing his life.

394
01:02:49,725 --> 01:02:51,828
He's quite a good shot.

395
01:02:57,692 --> 01:03:00,803
Have you finally come to save your apes?

396
01:03:01,696 --> 01:03:03,465
I came for you.

397
01:03:04,031 --> 01:03:05,533
For me?

398
01:03:08,536 --> 01:03:10,446
Who did I kill that night?

399
01:03:10,913 --> 01:03:12,373
My wife.

400
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:16,210
My son.

401
01:03:28,055 --> 01:03:29,424
I'm sorry.

402
01:03:30,391 --> 01:03:32,018
I was there for you.

403
01:03:43,070 --> 01:03:44,447
My God.

404
01:03:45,615 --> 01:03:47,742
Look at your eyes.

405
01:03:48,409 --> 01:03:50,036
Almost human.

406
01:03:54,415 --> 01:03:56,225
How did you know I was here?

407
01:03:56,626 --> 01:03:59,495
I was told you were coming.

408
01:04:00,880 --> 01:04:03,258
That more soldiers from the North,

409
01:04:03,925 --> 01:04:05,985
would be joining you here.

410
01:04:06,152 --> 01:04:07,136
Joining me?

411
01:04:07,303 --> 01:04:09,138
To finish us off.

412
01:04:10,556 --> 01:04:11,599
For good.

413
01:04:14,727 --> 01:04:16,229
Who told you that?

414
01:04:25,821 --> 01:04:26,822
Okay.

415
01:04:29,450 --> 01:04:30,451
Let's go.

416
01:05:09,490 --> 01:05:10,650
Father!

417
01:05:13,494 --> 01:05:14,704
Father!

418
01:06:37,036 --> 01:06:38,312
Lake.

419
01:06:39,246 --> 01:06:41,182
Forgive them.

420
01:06:41,415 --> 01:06:43,393
We've been through much.

421
01:06:55,137 --> 01:06:56,631
What have I done?

422
01:07:35,386 --> 01:07:37,246
Battalion, halt!

423
01:07:42,643 --> 01:07:43,686
Blood!

424
01:07:43,853 --> 01:07:45,104
Makes the grass grow!

425
01:07:45,813 --> 01:07:46,813
We!

426
01:07:46,897 --> 01:07:48,232
Make the blood flow!

427
01:07:48,607 --> 01:07:49,817
We are the beginning!

428
01:07:49,984 --> 01:07:51,277
And the end!

429
01:09:34,922 --> 01:09:37,299
We haven't had food or
water since we got here.

430
01:09:43,430 --> 01:09:45,057
Why do they need a wall?

431
01:10:01,031 --> 01:10:02,031
Hey!

432
01:10:04,118 --> 01:10:05,661
Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!

433
01:10:19,508 --> 01:10:20,509
Hey!

434
01:10:21,427 --> 01:10:22,436
Donkey!

435
01:10:23,721 --> 01:10:24,763
Get him.

436
01:10:24,930 --> 01:10:26,282
Okay, okay, okay.

437
01:10:56,670 --> 01:10:58,096
Leave him!

438
01:13:37,289 --> 01:13:39,249
Tell them to get back to work.

439
01:13:39,625 --> 01:13:42,920
Apes need food and water.

440
01:13:45,798 --> 01:13:47,174
Tell them.

441
01:13:47,341 --> 01:13:49,301
Give them food...

442
01:13:49,468 --> 01:13:50,803
and water.

443
01:13:59,019 --> 01:14:00,019
Five...

444
01:14:01,396 --> 01:14:02,523
Four.

445
01:14:03,982 --> 01:14:05,109
Three.

446
01:14:07,069 --> 01:14:08,237
Two.

447
01:14:26,171 --> 01:14:28,716
Hurry! Back to work!

448
01:14:46,900 --> 01:14:48,402
String him up, donkey.

449
01:14:58,495 --> 01:15:01,081
Bad place.

450
01:15:03,167 --> 01:15:04,835
Bad, bad place.

451
01:15:07,838 --> 01:15:09,281
What you see?

452
01:15:15,596 --> 01:15:16,722
Must save them!

453
01:15:16,847 --> 01:15:17,848
But how?

454
01:15:18,056 --> 01:15:19,224
Must think!

455
01:15:19,474 --> 01:15:21,610
What would Caesar do?

456
01:15:23,061 --> 01:15:24,171
Oh, no!

457
01:15:26,940 --> 01:15:28,150
Why so small?

458
01:16:01,516 --> 01:16:03,485
What did the Colonel promise you?

459
01:16:04,353 --> 01:16:05,374
You really,

460
01:16:05,699 --> 01:16:07,989
think he'll let you live,

461
01:16:08,332 --> 01:16:10,025
after we are gone?

462
01:16:11,151 --> 01:16:13,395
You let them call you donkey.

463
01:16:14,112 --> 01:16:16,206
You are ape.

464
01:16:26,041 --> 01:16:28,627
Kerna want see you.

465
01:16:53,318 --> 01:16:55,036
Interfere with the work again,

466
01:16:55,203 --> 01:16:57,790
and I'll begin slaughtering
the apes one by one.

467
01:16:57,856 --> 01:16:58,715
Understand?

468
01:16:58,840 --> 01:17:00,082
I need that wall.

469
01:17:00,425 --> 01:17:03,153
Apes need food and water.

470
01:17:03,220 --> 01:17:06,765
They'll get food and water
when they finish their work.

471
01:17:09,167 --> 01:17:11,595
Give apes food and water,

472
01:17:12,296 --> 01:17:14,022
or they cannot finish.

473
01:17:14,089 --> 01:17:16,125
You know, you are very emotional.

474
01:17:18,677 --> 01:17:21,888
What makes you think you're in
a position to make demands?

475
01:17:27,811 --> 01:17:28,979
Okay, let's go.

476
01:17:29,146 --> 01:17:30,797
The soldiers who are coming here,

477
01:17:31,064 --> 01:17:34,467
they are not coming to join you, are they?

478
01:17:35,694 --> 01:17:40,432
I saw men outside on the wall,
preparing for battle.

479
01:17:43,076 --> 01:17:44,919
They told me you were smart,

480
01:17:44,986 --> 01:17:47,548
but that's impressive.

481
01:17:47,914 --> 01:17:48,914
No.

482
01:17:49,875 --> 01:17:51,752
They won't be joining me.

483
01:17:52,127 --> 01:17:53,670
They are against you?

484
01:17:53,837 --> 01:17:56,198
They fear me.

485
01:17:56,465 --> 01:17:57,466
Why?

486
01:17:57,632 --> 01:18:00,018
Because you kill your own men?

487
01:18:01,219 --> 01:18:02,921
We found bodies.

488
01:18:03,889 --> 01:18:05,274
Something wrong,

489
01:18:05,974 --> 01:18:07,768
with these men.

490
01:18:10,479 --> 01:18:13,499
Jesus Christ, you are impressive.

491
01:18:14,399 --> 01:18:16,793
Well, you paint quite a picture.

492
01:18:16,860 --> 01:18:18,771
What you must think of me.

493
01:18:19,237 --> 01:18:22,557
I think you have no mercy.

494
01:18:40,842 --> 01:18:42,477
You came here to kill me.

495
01:18:43,929 --> 01:18:46,139
Were you gonna show me mercy?

496
01:18:46,506 --> 01:18:48,092
I showed you mercy,

497
01:18:48,558 --> 01:18:50,194
when I spared your men.

498
01:18:50,894 --> 01:18:53,313
I offered you peace,

499
01:18:53,480 --> 01:18:55,548
and you killed my family.

500
01:19:10,205 --> 01:19:11,331
Mercy.

501
01:19:12,499 --> 01:19:15,877
You have any idea what
your mercy would do to us?

502
01:19:20,048 --> 01:19:22,226
You're much stronger than we are.

503
01:19:23,009 --> 01:19:24,711
You're smart as hell.

504
01:19:25,178 --> 01:19:28,056
No matter what you say,
you'd eventually replace us.

505
01:19:28,223 --> 01:19:30,225
That's the law of nature.

506
01:19:30,976 --> 01:19:33,328
The irony is, we created you.

507
01:19:33,595 --> 01:19:36,331
We tried to defy nature,
bend it to our will.

508
01:19:36,398 --> 01:19:38,372
Nature has been punishing us,

509
01:19:38,497 --> 01:19:40,719
for our arrogance ever since.

510
01:19:43,780 --> 01:19:44,906
10 months ago,

511
01:19:44,990 --> 01:19:47,359
I sent out recon units to look for your base.

512
01:19:47,525 --> 01:19:50,454
My own son was a soldier
with one of the units.

513
01:19:50,620 --> 01:19:52,914
One day he suddenly
stopped speaking.

514
01:19:53,206 --> 01:19:55,617
He became primitive,
like an animal.

515
01:19:56,084 --> 01:19:57,219
They contacted me

516
01:19:57,243 --> 01:19:59,629
and said that they thought
he'd lost his mind.

517
01:20:00,464 --> 01:20:02,432
That the war was too much for him.

518
01:20:03,633 --> 01:20:06,628
Then the man who cared for him
stopped speaking too.

519
01:20:08,054 --> 01:20:09,874
Their medic had a theory,

520
01:20:10,999 --> 01:20:12,607
before he stopped speaking,

521
01:20:12,767 --> 01:20:15,470
that the virus that almost wiped us out,

522
01:20:15,937 --> 01:20:19,316
the virus that every human
survivor still carries,

523
01:20:19,649 --> 01:20:21,318
had suddenly changed.

524
01:20:21,985 --> 01:20:23,236
Mutated.

525
01:20:24,988 --> 01:20:27,057
And that if it spread,

526
01:20:27,324 --> 01:20:30,368
it would destroy humanity
for good this time.

527
01:20:31,745 --> 01:20:33,751
Not by killing us but by...

528
01:20:34,376 --> 01:20:37,591
robbing us of those things
that make us human.

529
01:20:37,834 --> 01:20:40,278
Our speech, our higher thinking,

530
01:20:40,504 --> 01:20:42,547
It would turn us into beasts.

531
01:20:42,714 --> 01:20:44,658
You talk about mercy?

532
01:20:46,927 --> 01:20:48,645
What would you have done?

533
01:20:51,806 --> 01:20:54,226
It was a moment of clarity for me.

534
01:20:54,935 --> 01:20:58,914
I realized that I would have
to sacrifice my only son,

535
01:20:59,481 --> 01:21:01,984
so that humanity could be saved.

536
01:21:05,070 --> 01:21:07,472
I held that gun in my hand,

537
01:21:07,639 --> 01:21:09,983
for a long time.

538
01:21:14,079 --> 01:21:15,430
I pointed it,

539
01:21:16,555 --> 01:21:18,165
at my only child,

540
01:21:20,585 --> 01:21:22,004
he looked at me,

541
01:21:23,838 --> 01:21:25,474
trust in his eyes.

542
01:21:28,677 --> 01:21:31,038
Even in his primitive gaze.

543
01:21:35,892 --> 01:21:37,475
I felt his...

544
01:21:38,400 --> 01:21:39,453
love.

545
01:21:46,361 --> 01:21:47,905
I pulled the trigger.

546
01:21:50,699 --> 01:21:52,250
It purified me.

547
01:21:53,994 --> 01:21:56,171
It made my purpose clear.

548
01:21:58,164 --> 01:22:00,959
I gave the orders
to kill the other infected.

549
01:22:01,042 --> 01:22:02,210
All of them.

550
01:22:02,377 --> 01:22:06,632
Burn their belongings and anything
that might spread contamination.

551
01:22:07,299 --> 01:22:09,784
Some of the men questioned my judgment.

552
01:22:10,051 --> 01:22:12,879
I was asking them to do what I had done.

553
01:22:13,046 --> 01:22:15,040
Sacrifice their friends,

554
01:22:16,349 --> 01:22:17,559
their family.

555
01:22:20,645 --> 01:22:22,397
Of course, they refused.

556
01:22:25,483 --> 01:22:27,152
So I had them killed too.

557
01:22:29,654 --> 01:22:31,932
Others with children,

558
01:22:32,198 --> 01:22:34,226
deserted into the woods.

559
01:22:35,327 --> 01:22:39,414
One of those cowards fled
to my superiors up North.

560
01:22:39,581 --> 01:22:41,099
They tried to convince me

561
01:22:41,182 --> 01:22:44,160
this plague could be dealt with medically.

562
01:22:44,586 --> 01:22:47,623
That's when I realized that
they had learned nothing...

563
01:22:49,390 --> 01:22:50,575
from our past.

564
01:22:51,801 --> 01:22:54,171
You killed them too?

565
01:22:56,765 --> 01:22:58,483
What did I do, Preacher?

566
01:22:59,851 --> 01:23:01,319
You severed their heads, sir.

567
01:23:02,937 --> 01:23:04,848
Except for the one I spared,

568
01:23:05,315 --> 01:23:07,984
so that he could return,
and deliver a message.

569
01:23:08,151 --> 01:23:10,812
If they wanted to relieve me
of my command,

570
01:23:11,179 --> 01:23:12,915
they would have to meet me here...

571
01:23:13,782 --> 01:23:15,342
and do it themselves.

572
01:23:15,909 --> 01:23:17,502
This used to be a weapons depot.

573
01:23:18,453 --> 01:23:20,764
They turned it into a relocation camp

574
01:23:20,847 --> 01:23:22,708
when the crisis was just beginning.

575
01:23:23,708 --> 01:23:25,377
But the weapons are still here,

576
01:23:26,544 --> 01:23:28,004
inside the mountain.

577
01:23:28,171 --> 01:23:29,573
How many men,

578
01:23:29,839 --> 01:23:31,366
will be coming?

579
01:23:31,633 --> 01:23:33,049
Probably all of them.

580
01:23:33,374 --> 01:23:34,927
But don't get any ideas.

581
01:23:35,069 --> 01:23:37,990
The only thing they fear more
than me is you apes.

582
01:23:45,271 --> 01:23:46,572
This is...

583
01:23:47,697 --> 01:23:49,258
a holy war.

584
01:23:50,777 --> 01:23:54,431
All of human history
has led to this moment.

585
01:23:55,448 --> 01:23:57,242
If we lose...

586
01:23:58,034 --> 01:23:59,912
we'll be the last of our kind.

587
01:24:00,578 --> 01:24:03,123
It will be a planet of apes.

588
01:24:04,749 --> 01:24:06,351
And we will become your cattle.

589
01:24:08,837 --> 01:24:10,197
Look at you.

590
01:24:11,214 --> 01:24:13,433
You think I'm sick, don't you?

591
01:24:22,058 --> 01:24:24,111
I didn't mean to kill your son.

592
01:24:26,688 --> 01:24:30,567
But if his destiny was to
inherit your unholy kingdom.

593
01:24:32,402 --> 01:24:34,404
I'm glad I did it.

594
01:24:34,487 --> 01:24:36,114
Hey! Hey!

595
01:24:36,614 --> 01:24:38,199
Get back!
Donkey, hold him!

596
01:24:38,742 --> 01:24:39,969
Hey!

597
01:24:47,167 --> 01:24:48,777
So emotional!

598
01:24:56,217 --> 01:24:58,303
I can see how conflicted you are.

599
01:24:59,679 --> 01:25:02,616
You're confused in your purpose.

600
01:25:03,183 --> 01:25:07,762
You are angry at me for something
I did that was an act of war.

601
01:25:08,229 --> 01:25:12,584
But you're taking this all
much too personally.

602
01:25:14,944 --> 01:25:16,246
What do you think...

603
01:25:17,238 --> 01:25:21,501
my men would have done to your
apes if you had killed me?

604
01:25:23,036 --> 01:25:24,997
Or is killing me more important?

605
01:25:38,218 --> 01:25:39,828
Soldiers everywhere!

606
01:25:40,178 --> 01:25:41,554
How will we get in?

607
01:25:43,056 --> 01:25:44,516
Must get in somehow,

608
01:25:45,433 --> 01:25:46,935
Must get in!

609
01:25:48,770 --> 01:25:50,021
In? In?

610
01:25:51,064 --> 01:25:52,065
No!

611
01:25:52,607 --> 01:25:54,901
No go in! No...

612
01:26:03,284 --> 01:26:04,711
Friends, friends!

613
01:26:05,078 --> 01:26:06,579
No, no go in.

614
01:26:07,046 --> 01:26:08,281
No go in...

615
01:26:11,876 --> 01:26:14,179
Friend! Friend!

616
01:26:18,091 --> 01:26:19,673
Thank you. Thank you.

617
01:26:19,898 --> 01:26:20,676
Friend.

618
01:27:06,973 --> 01:27:09,150
You saved our lives!

619
01:27:50,475 --> 01:27:51,802
Sick humans,

620
01:27:51,826 --> 01:27:53,921
must have escaped down here!

621
01:28:00,360 --> 01:28:02,153
No! No! No!

622
01:28:02,320 --> 01:28:04,064
No! No climb!

623
01:28:18,753 --> 01:28:19,753
What?

624
01:28:20,088 --> 01:28:21,714
What you see?

625
01:28:28,846 --> 01:28:30,556
Wonder where we are?

626
01:28:54,622 --> 01:28:57,417
Oh, no, friend!

627
01:29:01,212 --> 01:29:02,212
No!

628
01:29:03,589 --> 01:29:04,590
No!

629
01:29:05,758 --> 01:29:07,468
No! No!

630
01:29:07,835 --> 01:29:09,362
No! Come! Come!

631
01:29:13,891 --> 01:29:15,016
Come! Come back!

632
01:29:15,141 --> 01:29:16,184
Come! Come!

633
01:29:17,103 --> 01:29:18,171
No, come!

634
01:29:18,980 --> 01:29:20,865
Come! Come! Come!
Come!

635
01:29:53,264 --> 01:29:54,340
Koba!

636
01:29:59,937 --> 01:30:01,314
Sleep.

637
01:30:02,315 --> 01:30:04,726
You cannot save them.

638
01:30:06,819 --> 01:30:10,323
Apes all die here.

639
01:30:13,326 --> 01:30:14,360
No!

640
01:30:14,827 --> 01:30:15,895
Yes.

641
01:30:17,997 --> 01:30:19,833
Join me.

642
01:30:36,641 --> 01:30:38,618
If he's still alive in the morning...

643
01:30:44,649 --> 01:30:47,127
he goes to work like everyone else...

644
01:30:48,486 --> 01:30:49,788
or you shoot him.

645
01:30:50,655 --> 01:30:53,241
Come! Come, come.

646
01:30:57,036 --> 01:30:58,371
She go in!

647
01:32:06,564 --> 01:32:08,124
Thirsty?

648
01:34:25,244 --> 01:34:26,287
Hide!

649
01:34:26,954 --> 01:34:27,955
Quick!

650
01:34:38,257 --> 01:34:40,043
Humans will kill her!

651
01:34:41,802 --> 01:34:43,196
I know what to do! Go!

652
01:34:53,064 --> 01:34:55,274
Arms up! Hey! Hey!

653
01:34:55,441 --> 01:34:56,984
Arms up!
Watch it! Watch it!

654
01:35:00,654 --> 01:35:01,655
Let's go!

655
01:35:03,783 --> 01:35:04,992
Keep 'em up!

656
01:35:09,121 --> 01:35:10,581
Follow him down.

657
01:35:14,794 --> 01:35:15,794
Keep them up!

658
01:36:17,398 --> 01:36:19,091
Are there others out there?

659
01:36:27,032 --> 01:36:28,367
Sweep the area.

660
01:36:29,535 --> 01:36:30,661
Put him in the pen.

661
01:37:14,288 --> 01:37:15,833
Feeling better?

662
01:37:23,047 --> 01:37:24,047
Good.

663
01:37:24,131 --> 01:37:25,841
Then we can talk about...

664
01:37:26,634 --> 01:37:27,977
Escape.

665
01:37:29,094 --> 01:37:31,055
Apes together strong!

666
01:37:40,231 --> 01:37:41,440
We are the beginning!

667
01:37:41,607 --> 01:37:42,775
And the end!

668
01:38:06,632 --> 01:38:08,100
Still alive.

669
01:38:39,915 --> 01:38:41,733
Send him to the quarry, alone.

670
01:38:45,254 --> 01:38:46,254
Hold on.

671
01:39:05,524 --> 01:39:06,859
What is this?

672
01:39:11,113 --> 01:39:12,698
How did this get in there?

673
01:39:16,035 --> 01:39:17,202
Get him to work.

674
01:39:31,050 --> 01:39:32,676
Thirty-seven.

675
01:39:43,437 --> 01:39:44,563
Fifty-five.

676
01:39:47,024 --> 01:39:49,234
Thirty-seven steps to the adult cage.

677
01:39:49,652 --> 01:39:51,437
Fifty-five to the children.

678
01:40:30,693 --> 01:40:31,803
You know,

679
01:40:32,569 --> 01:40:34,563
Kerna shoot apes,

680
01:40:34,905 --> 01:40:36,407
when war is done.

681
01:40:40,119 --> 01:40:43,122
His war is madness.

682
01:40:44,289 --> 01:40:45,708
It won't save him...

683
01:40:47,626 --> 01:40:49,995
any more than it will save you.

684
01:40:50,162 --> 01:40:51,855
I save myself.

685
01:40:52,965 --> 01:40:55,183
Is there anything left...

686
01:40:56,708 --> 01:40:58,311
of you to save?

687
01:41:20,409 --> 01:41:21,618
I do.

688
01:41:39,219 --> 01:41:40,804
Apes going back to the cage?

689
01:41:44,725 --> 01:41:45,743
You.

690
01:41:46,852 --> 01:41:47,978
Are very brave.

691
01:41:49,480 --> 01:41:50,647
Brave?

692
01:41:50,898 --> 01:41:51,924
Brave!

693
01:41:52,733 --> 01:41:53,793
Brave!

694
01:41:59,198 --> 01:42:00,365
Ape?

695
01:42:02,701 --> 01:42:03,702
Me?

696
01:42:03,994 --> 01:42:05,137
Ape?

697
01:42:13,378 --> 01:42:14,713
You are...

698
01:42:27,142 --> 01:42:28,977
Nova.

699
01:42:31,230 --> 01:42:32,397
Nova.

700
01:42:43,742 --> 01:42:45,344
Come! Come!
Come see!

701
01:42:45,911 --> 01:42:46,979
Come see!

702
01:42:47,913 --> 01:42:48,747
Come!

703
01:42:49,372 --> 01:42:50,539
Come see!

704
01:43:05,389 --> 01:43:08,300
34, 35, 36, 37.

705
01:43:08,324 --> 01:43:09,267
30...

706
01:43:09,468 --> 01:43:10,369
37!

707
01:43:12,688 --> 01:43:13,822
I do.

708
01:43:16,641 --> 01:43:17,776
What now?

709
01:43:26,410 --> 01:43:27,410
What?

710
01:43:33,792 --> 01:43:35,794
Oh, no!

711
01:43:36,461 --> 01:43:37,629
Oh, no!

712
01:43:38,630 --> 01:43:39,923
No, no!

713
01:43:40,090 --> 01:43:41,300
No, no, no...

714
01:43:46,763 --> 01:43:47,856
Okay.

715
01:44:54,039 --> 01:44:56,625
This is the ape I told you about!

716
01:44:58,710 --> 01:44:59,920
Thank you.

717
01:45:17,562 --> 01:45:18,981
Bad Ape.

718
01:45:39,710 --> 01:45:40,710
What's wrong?

719
01:46:00,605 --> 01:46:01,732
We can't keep digging!

720
01:46:02,065 --> 01:46:04,234
It will flood the whole tunnel!

721
01:46:04,484 --> 01:46:06,979
If we don't, we can't reach the children!

722
01:46:26,965 --> 01:46:28,933
We must keep looking down there.

723
01:46:28,967 --> 01:46:30,802
Find another way to reach the children.

724
01:46:31,178 --> 01:46:32,929
We must leave now!

725
01:46:33,421 --> 01:46:35,239
More soldiers are coming!

726
01:46:35,498 --> 01:46:38,635
Humans will destroy each other!
And us with them!

727
01:46:43,607 --> 01:46:45,327
We'll have to get the
children out above ground!

728
01:46:46,318 --> 01:46:47,344
How?

729
01:47:21,603 --> 01:47:22,604
Hey!

730
01:47:24,106 --> 01:47:25,440
You animals!

731
01:47:45,877 --> 01:47:46,962
Who did that?

732
01:47:48,130 --> 01:47:49,464
Who did that?

733
01:47:54,052 --> 01:47:55,287
Who was it?

734
01:48:03,395 --> 01:48:04,646
Was it you?

735
01:49:57,525 --> 01:49:58,943
I love you, son.

736
01:51:08,747 --> 01:51:10,582
Go, go, go, go.

737
01:51:28,433 --> 01:51:29,768
Hurry! Let's go!

738
01:51:34,773 --> 01:51:35,908
Caesar, what's wrong?

739
01:51:47,243 --> 01:51:48,870
Hurry, you must go.

740
01:51:49,954 --> 01:51:51,190
Without you?

741
01:51:52,415 --> 01:51:53,425
No.

742
01:51:54,209 --> 01:51:55,819
Maurice was right.

743
01:52:00,799 --> 01:52:02,025
I am...

744
01:52:03,526 --> 01:52:04,819
like Koba.

745
01:52:05,762 --> 01:52:06,888
He could not...

746
01:52:08,056 --> 01:52:09,933
escape his hate.

747
01:52:15,980 --> 01:52:18,316
And I still cannot escape mine.

748
01:52:24,781 --> 01:52:26,124
Move, go, go.

749
01:52:26,448 --> 01:52:27,448
Go, go.

750
01:52:27,472 --> 01:52:28,842
Go, go.

751
01:52:29,043 --> 01:52:30,044
Fire!

752
01:53:13,121 --> 01:53:15,457
Colonel! Colonel!

753
01:53:17,876 --> 01:53:19,294
Where the hell is he?

754
01:53:53,036 --> 01:53:55,613
Down! Down! Down! Down!

755
01:53:56,915 --> 01:53:58,082
Get down!

756
01:58:12,962 --> 01:58:14,505
Take him out!

757
01:58:26,142 --> 01:58:28,269
Come on, donkey.
Let's go! Reload!

758
01:59:03,805 --> 01:59:06,307
Colonel, are you in there? 
Colonel!

759
01:59:06,974 --> 01:59:08,518
Just break it down.

760
01:59:48,599 --> 01:59:49,599
Donkey!

761
01:59:50,351 --> 01:59:51,727
Grenade launcher!

762
02:00:48,951 --> 02:00:51,896
God damn it, donkey!
Get me the launcher!

763
02:05:01,036 --> 02:05:04,081
Oh, no! Oh, no!

764
02:05:04,248 --> 02:05:06,208
Oh, no! Oh, no!

765
02:09:11,745 --> 02:09:13,114
Don't worry.

766
02:09:18,001 --> 02:09:19,320
Maurice.

767
02:09:23,257 --> 02:09:27,761
You are all home now.

768
02:09:31,598 --> 02:09:33,809
Apes are strong.

769
02:09:37,855 --> 02:09:38,848
Withe...

770
02:09:40,357 --> 02:09:42,192

771
02:10:09,344 --> 02:10:10,754
Son...

772
02:10:13,557 --> 02:10:15,259
will know...

773
02:10:17,019 --> 02:10:18,095
who...

774
02:10:19,646 --> 02:10:21,064
was...

775
02:10:22,357 --> 02:10:23,692
father.

776
02:10:34,661 --> 02:10:36,046
And what...

777
02:10:38,415 --> 02:10:39,917
Caesar...

778
02:10:43,086 --> 02:10:44,179
did...

779
02:10:45,839 --> 02:10:47,341
for us.

780
02:11:53,115 --> 02:11:54,284
Caesar...
