1
00:00:30,104 --> 00:00:31,741
Ooh. Ooh-la-la.

2
00:00:31,776 --> 00:00:33,644
Illumination!

3
00:00:33,679 --> 00:00:36,845
And now for a bedtime story.

4
00:00:38,420 --> 00:00:39,980
- ♪ ♪

5
00:00:40,015 --> 00:00:43,555
Once upon a time, there
was a beautiful pond.

6
00:00:44,393 --> 00:00:46,162
It was paradise.

7
00:00:46,197 --> 00:00:49,528
- Everyone was happy there.

8
00:00:49,563 --> 00:00:52,762
Well, not everyone.

9
00:00:52,797 --> 00:00:54,632
For two ducklings were suffering

10
00:00:54,667 --> 00:00:57,096
from a strange condition.

11
00:00:57,131 --> 00:00:59,175
They were bored.

12
00:01:01,509 --> 00:01:03,410
And they were eager to
discover what lay beyond

13
00:01:03,445 --> 00:01:05,412
their cozy little pond.

14
00:01:05,447 --> 00:01:07,007
Come on. Let's have a look.

15
00:01:07,042 --> 00:01:09,482
But Daddy says it's
dangerous to leave the pond.

16
00:01:09,517 --> 00:01:11,253
We're brave and strong.

17
00:01:11,288 --> 00:01:12,782
We ain't scared of nothing.

18
00:01:12,817 --> 00:01:15,752
So they decided to go for it,

19
00:01:15,787 --> 00:01:18,458
- straight into the arms of...

20
00:01:18,493 --> 00:01:20,658
predators!

21
00:01:26,633 --> 00:01:29,271
- They were surrounded, trapped.

22
00:01:29,306 --> 00:01:30,899
But the ducklings
were not afraid.

23
00:01:30,934 --> 00:01:35,002
The tiny heroes attacked
the predator, and...

24
00:01:35,037 --> 00:01:36,707
they died.

25
00:01:36,742 --> 00:01:38,445
The end.

26
00:01:39,481 --> 00:01:42,251
Uh, that's all? They're dead?

27
00:01:42,286 --> 00:01:44,077
Oh, yeah. No survivors.

28
00:01:44,112 --> 00:01:45,287
But how?

29
00:01:45,322 --> 00:01:46,684
Oh, you want details? Okay.

30
00:01:46,719 --> 00:01:48,323
So, first, the heron
cut them in half...

31
00:01:48,358 --> 00:01:49,599
Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa.

32
00:01:49,623 --> 00:01:51,590
Wait a second here.

33
00:01:51,625 --> 00:01:54,153
Your father got the
story wrong... again.

34
00:01:54,188 --> 00:01:55,627
What really happened was:

35
00:01:55,662 --> 00:01:57,596
The heron saw that
they were lost,

36
00:01:57,631 --> 00:01:59,400
so she offered to help them.

37
00:01:59,435 --> 00:02:01,127
Pam, it's a heron.

38
00:02:01,162 --> 00:02:04,438
A psycho killer designed
to eat ducklings.

39
00:02:04,473 --> 00:02:05,901
All right, fine.

40
00:02:05,936 --> 00:02:07,837
The heron was about to eat them.

41
00:02:07,872 --> 00:02:11,676
But their parents arrived
just in time and saved them.

42
00:02:11,711 --> 00:02:13,678
Oh, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no, no.

43
00:02:13,713 --> 00:02:17,044
Their parents arrived,
but it was too late.

44
00:02:17,079 --> 00:02:18,518
Oh, Dax, don't worry.

45
00:02:18,553 --> 00:02:20,751
It's going to be okay.

46
00:02:20,786 --> 00:02:22,148
Really, Dad?

47
00:02:22,183 --> 00:02:23,655
Yeah, sure.

48
00:02:23,690 --> 00:02:25,987
Squished ducks, they can
achieve great things, too.

49
00:02:26,022 --> 00:02:27,494
As long as they stay in the pond

50
00:02:27,529 --> 00:02:29,265
far from the dangers
of the world,

51
00:02:29,300 --> 00:02:31,630
such as herons and
bears and wolves

52
00:02:31,665 --> 00:02:33,863
and storms and cyclones

53
00:02:33,898 --> 00:02:36,932
and tornadoes and crocodiles
and poisonous mushrooms...

54
00:02:36,967 --> 00:02:39,506
Okay. I really need
to get to bed now.

55
00:02:39,541 --> 00:02:41,277
And saber-toothed tigers...

56
00:02:41,312 --> 00:02:42,773
What happened to
the other duckling?

57
00:02:42,808 --> 00:02:45,039
- Was she squished,
too? Oh, no, no, no.

58
00:02:45,074 --> 00:02:46,414
Don't worry, Gwen.

59
00:02:46,449 --> 00:02:48,009
The ducklings were both safe.

60
00:02:48,044 --> 00:02:49,824
They just went on their
way right back to the pond.

61
00:02:49,848 --> 00:02:51,914
But another predator
came in and...

62
00:02:51,949 --> 00:02:54,356
And wished them good day.

63
00:02:54,391 --> 00:02:56,215
- The end.

64
00:02:56,250 --> 00:02:57,854
- That's it.

65
00:02:59,759 --> 00:03:01,187
Okay.

66
00:03:02,498 --> 00:03:03,761
Good night, Mom.

67
00:03:03,796 --> 00:03:05,961
- Good night, Dad.
- Good night.

68
00:03:07,635 --> 00:03:09,195
- What?

69
00:03:09,230 --> 00:03:12,737
Every time you tell a story,
Gwen wets her twig bed.

70
00:03:12,772 --> 00:03:14,376
Does she? That's great.

71
00:03:14,411 --> 00:03:16,609
See? That means
she's learning, Pam.

72
00:03:16,644 --> 00:03:18,006
Oh, learning what?

73
00:03:18,041 --> 00:03:20,041
That she should
never leave the pond?

74
00:03:20,076 --> 00:03:21,614
Exactly.

75
00:03:21,649 --> 00:03:23,550
Trust me, I'm teaching
her very valuable fears.

76
00:03:23,585 --> 00:03:26,916
I should know. I've lived
with them my entire life.

77
00:03:28,249 --> 00:03:31,118
So have we all.

78
00:03:31,153 --> 00:03:32,955
Good night, honey.

79
00:03:34,255 --> 00:03:36,222
Good night, sweetheart.

80
00:03:59,247 --> 00:04:01,280
Ready, set, go!

81
00:04:01,315 --> 00:04:02,886
Come on, Gwenny! Come on!

82
00:04:02,921 --> 00:04:04,954
Let's go. Let's go.
Beat Daddy. Beat Daddy.

83
00:04:04,989 --> 00:04:07,121
Go, go, go, go! Oh, yay!

84
00:04:07,156 --> 00:04:08,463
- Yes!
- Aw, I lost.

85
00:04:09,829 --> 00:04:11,796
Whoo! Yes!

86
00:04:12,832 --> 00:04:14,898
- Whoo...

87
00:04:16,330 --> 00:04:18,066
- Hey.
- Huh?

88
00:04:19,366 --> 00:04:20,871
- Hello!

89
00:04:20,906 --> 00:04:21,906
Huh?

90
00:04:35,283 --> 00:04:37,052
- Yay!

91
00:04:37,087 --> 00:04:38,757
- Mine!
- You're the worst!

92
00:04:38,792 --> 00:04:40,693
- That's mine!
- Got a thousand of 'em!

93
00:04:40,728 --> 00:04:42,464
- Whoa.
- Thanks, Dad!

94
00:04:42,499 --> 00:04:44,895
Whoa!

95
00:04:55,171 --> 00:04:56,335
Okay, guys.

96
00:04:56,370 --> 00:04:58,370
Remember to pick
the fresh leaves.

97
00:04:58,405 --> 00:05:00,042
Okay, Dad.

98
00:05:00,077 --> 00:05:01,373
Is this one good, Dad?

99
00:05:01,408 --> 00:05:02,451
Perfect.

100
00:05:02,486 --> 00:05:04,552
Keep looking for more.

101
00:05:10,285 --> 00:05:11,757
Guys!

102
00:05:11,792 --> 00:05:13,088
Guys, you have to see something.

103
00:05:13,123 --> 00:05:14,694
It's incredible.
Come on, come on.

104
00:05:14,729 --> 00:05:16,861
Everybody, come. Come on.

105
00:05:25,003 --> 00:05:26,541
Whoo! Oh, look!

106
00:05:26,576 --> 00:05:28,774
- Oh, I told you.
- Yeah!

107
00:05:28,809 --> 00:05:30,578
Isn't it beautiful?
This is awesome!

108
00:05:30,613 --> 00:05:33,207
Oh! Have you ever
seen ducks like that?

109
00:05:44,594 --> 00:05:45,890
Look at that.

110
00:05:45,925 --> 00:05:47,892
- They must be migrating.

111
00:05:47,927 --> 00:05:49,465
- Whoa.

112
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:52,424
They seem so
mysterious and exotic.

113
00:05:52,459 --> 00:05:54,360
I wonder where
they flew in from.

114
00:05:54,395 --> 00:05:55,603
Maybe we should go say hi.

115
00:05:55,638 --> 00:05:56,802
Should we?

116
00:05:56,837 --> 00:05:58,331
No. Oh, look at these feathers.

117
00:05:58,366 --> 00:05:59,673
No, I want to know.

118
00:05:59,708 --> 00:06:01,609
Let's go ask 'em.
Mack, come on.

119
00:06:01,644 --> 00:06:03,974
Yeah, no, I'm good.

120
00:06:04,009 --> 00:06:05,239
Ugh. Come on.

121
00:06:05,274 --> 00:06:07,208
We never meet anyone new.

122
00:06:07,243 --> 00:06:09,177
Okay, fine.

123
00:06:09,212 --> 00:06:13,214
All right, kids, let's go
meet Mom's new friends.

124
00:06:13,249 --> 00:06:15,051
Kids?

125
00:06:15,086 --> 00:06:17,757
Kids? Kids?

126
00:06:17,792 --> 00:06:18,989
Pretty good progress, huh?

127
00:06:19,024 --> 00:06:20,496
Yeah. Got to love a tailwind.

128
00:06:20,531 --> 00:06:21,662
- Yeah.
- Oh.

129
00:06:21,697 --> 00:06:23,158
- Hello.
- Ah. Hello.

130
00:06:23,193 --> 00:06:24,324
Welcome to the pond.

131
00:06:24,359 --> 00:06:25,424
- Thank you.
- Hey there.

132
00:06:25,459 --> 00:06:26,601
- Oh, hi.
- Nice feathers.

133
00:06:26,636 --> 00:06:27,833
We shouldn't be here, Dax.

134
00:06:27,868 --> 00:06:29,538
- Shh!
- Dad is gonna be mad.

135
00:06:29,573 --> 00:06:31,001
- Go back to the parents, Gwen.

136
00:06:31,036 --> 00:06:33,300
- Hey there.
- Dax!

137
00:06:33,335 --> 00:06:34,642
What are you doing?

138
00:06:34,677 --> 00:06:36,072
I don't want to
be psycho-killed!

139
00:06:36,107 --> 00:06:38,305
Let me go, you little feathery wart!
-Oh.

140
00:06:38,340 --> 00:06:40,010
Okay, I'm a feathery wart?

141
00:06:40,045 --> 00:06:41,781
You don't even know me.

142
00:06:41,816 --> 00:06:43,849
No, no, no, no, no, no.
She's a feathery wart.

143
00:06:43,884 --> 00:06:45,312
You're a very nice wart.

144
00:06:45,347 --> 00:06:46,786
I-I mean wart duck.

145
00:06:46,821 --> 00:06:48,315
- I mean...
- I'm kidding.

146
00:06:48,350 --> 00:06:49,855
Oh. Right.

147
00:06:51,859 --> 00:06:53,760
Hi. I'm Kim.

148
00:06:53,795 --> 00:06:55,454
Hi. I'm Dax.

149
00:06:55,489 --> 00:06:56,895
Welcome to Moosehead Pond.

150
00:06:56,930 --> 00:06:58,457
"Welcome to na-na-na."

151
00:06:58,492 --> 00:07:00,899
You and your flock can stay
here as long as you like.

152
00:07:00,934 --> 00:07:02,604
- I could show you around.
- Hmm?

153
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:05,332
I mean, this is
pretty much it, but...

154
00:07:05,367 --> 00:07:06,872
Mmm. Thanks.

155
00:07:06,907 --> 00:07:09,006
But we're just passing
by on our way down south.

156
00:07:09,041 --> 00:07:10,381
We're gonna spend
the winter there.

157
00:07:10,405 --> 00:07:11,470
Where are you guys going?

158
00:07:11,505 --> 00:07:12,812
We spend winter here

159
00:07:12,847 --> 00:07:14,247
to avoid psycho
killers like your...

160
00:07:14,277 --> 00:07:16,046
- Sorry. Wart.

161
00:07:16,081 --> 00:07:19,412
Wait. So you don't go
anywhere for the winter?

162
00:07:19,447 --> 00:07:20,820
Uh, nope.

163
00:07:20,855 --> 00:07:23,152
You should totally come with us.

164
00:07:23,187 --> 00:07:24,923
- What? Really?

165
00:07:24,958 --> 00:07:27,123
Yes! Your flock could
totally join ours.

166
00:07:27,158 --> 00:07:28,894
Oh, my gosh, this
will be so cool.

167
00:07:28,929 --> 00:07:31,490
You will love migrating.
The sun, the sand.

168
00:07:31,525 --> 00:07:33,294
Wait. Do you like tropical food?

169
00:07:33,329 --> 00:07:34,944
- What's your take on bananas?
- Oh. I don't...

170
00:07:34,968 --> 00:07:36,363
Ah, you're gonna love 'em!

171
00:07:36,398 --> 00:07:38,431
You hold this.
I'll go ask my dad.

172
00:07:38,466 --> 00:07:39,641
Dad! Dad!

173
00:07:39,676 --> 00:07:41,269
- What just happened?
- Dad!

174
00:07:41,304 --> 00:07:43,502
I don't know, but
you're in trouble.

175
00:07:43,537 --> 00:07:45,108
Dax! Gwen!

176
00:07:45,143 --> 00:07:47,946
Are you crazy? You can't
just take off like that.

177
00:07:47,981 --> 00:07:50,245
- He made me do it!
- What?

178
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:52,511
And he talked to a girl.

179
00:07:52,546 --> 00:07:54,117
- A girl?
- Gwen!

180
00:07:54,152 --> 00:07:56,592
Yeah, and he told her
he wants to marry her.

181
00:07:56,627 --> 00:07:58,693
What? I didn't say that!

182
00:07:58,728 --> 00:08:00,156
You said it with your eyes.

183
00:08:00,191 --> 00:08:02,125
Dad, he's hitting
me! He's hitting me!

184
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:03,665
Hey, hey, hey, hey!
Enough! Enough!

185
00:08:03,700 --> 00:08:06,294
- Sibling cruelty!
- Enough.

186
00:08:06,329 --> 00:08:07,702
Okay. Hello.

187
00:08:07,737 --> 00:08:09,132
Hi. Hi. Big hellos.

188
00:08:09,167 --> 00:08:10,639
And we're good. Let's go.

189
00:08:10,674 --> 00:08:12,036
- Mack.
- What? I said hi.

190
00:08:12,071 --> 00:08:13,642
I smiled. I made eye contact.

191
00:08:13,677 --> 00:08:15,204
I checked all the boxes.

192
00:08:15,239 --> 00:08:16,370
Hey there.

193
00:08:16,405 --> 00:08:18,537
I hear you want to
join our migration.

194
00:08:18,572 --> 00:08:20,440
Sorry?

195
00:08:20,475 --> 00:08:22,376
Oh, we're going back to Jamaica.

196
00:08:22,411 --> 00:08:23,619
Have you ever been?

197
00:08:23,654 --> 00:08:25,016
No.

198
00:08:25,051 --> 00:08:27,084
Oh, it's just magical.

199
00:08:27,119 --> 00:08:29,548
I swear, there's even
a luminous lagoon

200
00:08:29,583 --> 00:08:30,890
where the water glows.

201
00:08:30,925 --> 00:08:33,255
Oh, wow. Oh, I really
want to see that.

202
00:08:33,290 --> 00:08:35,059
Well, then it is settled.

203
00:08:35,094 --> 00:08:37,061
Your whole flock can join us.

204
00:08:37,096 --> 00:08:38,458
This is gonna be great.

205
00:08:38,493 --> 00:08:39,932
Oh, gosh. That's...

206
00:08:39,967 --> 00:08:41,527
That's just so nice of you.

207
00:08:41,562 --> 00:08:43,133
Wait, wait, wait.

208
00:08:43,168 --> 00:08:45,564
I think there's a slight
misunderstanding here.

209
00:08:45,599 --> 00:08:47,907
Unfortunately, we're
just slammed this winter.

210
00:08:47,942 --> 00:08:49,744
Aren't we, Pam?

211
00:08:49,779 --> 00:08:51,746
'Cause we've got the
thing, and then the...

212
00:08:51,781 --> 00:08:54,683
We got the thing after that.
So, you know what? We can't go.

213
00:08:54,718 --> 00:08:56,278
But you guys go.

214
00:08:56,313 --> 00:08:57,653
Have a great time.

215
00:08:57,688 --> 00:09:01,052
And, you know, tell the
glowing water we said hi.

216
00:09:02,451 --> 00:09:04,858
Uh, well, maybe next year, then?

217
00:09:04,893 --> 00:09:06,926
You got it. Next year!

218
00:09:06,961 --> 00:09:11,997
Uh, well, I guess it's
time for us to go.

219
00:09:15,563 --> 00:09:17,970
Uh, have a nice trip.

220
00:09:18,808 --> 00:09:20,434
Thanks.

221
00:09:20,469 --> 00:09:23,140
Have a nice... pond.

222
00:09:31,414 --> 00:09:34,250
I'm so sorry you can't
have babies with her.

223
00:09:40,423 --> 00:09:43,391
That was so... rude!

224
00:09:43,426 --> 00:09:44,590
I know.

225
00:09:44,625 --> 00:09:46,328
"Have a nice pond."

226
00:09:46,363 --> 00:09:47,560
Who says that?

227
00:09:47,595 --> 00:09:48,968
That's just poor parenting.

228
00:09:49,003 --> 00:09:50,937
Not them. You.

229
00:09:50,972 --> 00:09:53,467
- Me?
- Yes, you.

230
00:09:53,502 --> 00:09:56,536
Okay. So I got a
little carried away.

231
00:09:56,571 --> 00:09:58,373
But migration?

232
00:09:58,408 --> 00:09:59,781
What a stupid idea.

233
00:09:59,816 --> 00:10:02,080
- Ugh. Okay. You're impossible.
- Why?

234
00:10:02,115 --> 00:10:04,082
Because I found a safe
place for us to live

235
00:10:04,117 --> 00:10:06,051
and we're happy here?

236
00:10:06,086 --> 00:10:08,086
You mean you're happy here.

237
00:10:08,121 --> 00:10:09,351
What?

238
00:10:09,386 --> 00:10:11,892
I-I want us to get
out and see the world.

239
00:10:11,927 --> 00:10:13,322
- Me, too, Dad.
- Yeah.

240
00:10:13,357 --> 00:10:16,028
I want to go to
Jamai... Jam... J...

241
00:10:16,063 --> 00:10:17,799
where they make jam.

242
00:10:17,834 --> 00:10:20,263
You-you really
want those things?

243
00:10:20,298 --> 00:10:21,627
Yes.

244
00:10:21,662 --> 00:10:23,904
- Really? Yes.

245
00:10:23,939 --> 00:10:25,070
No home improvements?

246
00:10:25,105 --> 00:10:26,698
- PAM and DAX: No! Yes.

247
00:10:26,733 --> 00:10:28,568
I mean... I mean no.

248
00:10:28,603 --> 00:10:31,010
D-Do you know what can
happen on a trip that long?

249
00:10:31,045 --> 00:10:32,407
What sort of father would I be

250
00:10:32,442 --> 00:10:34,244
if I put my young
fowl in harm's way

251
00:10:34,279 --> 00:10:37,478
for no reason except a chance
at a Caribbean vacation?

252
00:10:37,513 --> 00:10:39,579
A father who knows it's
important for his kids

253
00:10:39,614 --> 00:10:41,383
to see other parts of the world.

254
00:10:41,418 --> 00:10:43,253
Mack, I don't want
to miss out on life

255
00:10:43,288 --> 00:10:45,552
because you're afraid
to leave this pond.

256
00:10:45,587 --> 00:10:47,994
This isn't about migration.

257
00:10:48,029 --> 00:10:51,030
It's about adventure.

258
00:10:51,065 --> 00:10:54,198
Seeing what else
life has to offer.

259
00:10:54,233 --> 00:10:56,596
Is that a little scary? Sure.

260
00:10:56,631 --> 00:10:58,807
But isn't it worth it?

261
00:11:00,206 --> 00:11:01,700
No, Pam.

262
00:11:01,735 --> 00:11:03,537
Not really.

263
00:11:07,114 --> 00:11:11,017
You really need to
open your eyes, Mack,

264
00:11:11,052 --> 00:11:13,921
before you miss it all.

265
00:11:13,956 --> 00:11:15,890
Come on, kids.

266
00:11:28,630 --> 00:11:30,399
- Hmm?

267
00:11:31,765 --> 00:11:33,237
Huh? Huh?

268
00:11:34,944 --> 00:11:36,735
Uncle Dan, what
are you doing here?

269
00:11:38,244 --> 00:11:40,112
I don't know.

270
00:11:40,147 --> 00:11:42,983
I must have drifted
from my nest again.

271
00:11:45,251 --> 00:11:47,185
Be a good boy and
get me back there.

272
00:11:47,220 --> 00:11:48,824
Give me a little push.

273
00:11:48,859 --> 00:11:50,958
All right.

274
00:11:58,198 --> 00:12:00,264
Thank you.

275
00:12:00,299 --> 00:12:02,871
I heard the little family tiff.

276
00:12:02,906 --> 00:12:04,939
I got to say...

277
00:12:04,974 --> 00:12:06,468
you're right.

278
00:12:06,503 --> 00:12:08,074
Wha... I am?

279
00:12:08,109 --> 00:12:09,273
Please.

280
00:12:09,308 --> 00:12:10,978
What's all the travel talk?

281
00:12:11,013 --> 00:12:13,079
I mean, why can't
we be satisfied

282
00:12:13,114 --> 00:12:14,949
with what we already have?

283
00:12:14,984 --> 00:12:16,951
Well, yeah.

284
00:12:16,986 --> 00:12:18,315
I mean, you got food right here.

285
00:12:18,350 --> 00:12:20,746
We got a pond
right here. Right?

286
00:12:20,781 --> 00:12:22,891
Yeah. Food, the pond.

287
00:12:22,926 --> 00:12:24,750
Why go anywhere else?

288
00:12:24,785 --> 00:12:26,290
Stick to your beliefs, kid.

289
00:12:26,325 --> 00:12:29,029
- Don't change for anyone.
- Exactly.

290
00:12:29,064 --> 00:12:30,866
And you'll end up just like me.

291
00:12:30,901 --> 00:12:32,659
- Happy.
- Yeah.

292
00:12:32,694 --> 00:12:33,869
- Healthy.
- Yeah.

293
00:12:33,904 --> 00:12:35,431
And totally alone!

294
00:12:35,466 --> 00:12:37,499
Yeah! Wait, what?

295
00:12:37,534 --> 00:12:38,940
That's right.

296
00:12:38,975 --> 00:12:41,910
You'll be living the dream.

297
00:12:43,309 --> 00:12:45,144
Whoa, that was exhausting.

298
00:12:45,179 --> 00:12:47,410
I'm gonna just rest here.

299
00:12:51,812 --> 00:12:53,845
Rise and shine, Mallards!

300
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:55,253
We're burning daylight.

301
00:12:55,288 --> 00:12:56,815
Up and at 'em.

302
00:12:56,850 --> 00:12:58,190
Let's go, go, go!

303
00:12:58,225 --> 00:13:00,192
Here's breakfast.

304
00:13:00,227 --> 00:13:02,161
Dad, what are you doing?

305
00:13:02,196 --> 00:13:03,899
Getting your sorry
feathers out of bed.

306
00:13:03,934 --> 00:13:05,791
Come on. We got to get ready.

307
00:13:05,826 --> 00:13:08,101
Mack, ready for what?

308
00:13:08,136 --> 00:13:10,103
Nothing. Just, you know,

309
00:13:10,138 --> 00:13:14,008
for our big, super
fun family migration!

310
00:13:14,043 --> 00:13:15,339
What?

311
00:13:15,374 --> 00:13:17,539
Ha! Bet you didn't
see that coming.

312
00:13:17,574 --> 00:13:19,409
- Are-are you serious?
- Yep.

313
00:13:19,444 --> 00:13:22,874
An adventure into
the totally unknown.

314
00:13:22,909 --> 00:13:24,579
And I'm gonna love it.

315
00:13:24,614 --> 00:13:27,054
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa. I-Is this real?

316
00:13:27,089 --> 00:13:28,363
What do you mean,
"Is this real?"

317
00:13:28,387 --> 00:13:29,650
We're really going?

318
00:13:29,685 --> 00:13:30,783
- Yes.
- On a migration?

319
00:13:30,818 --> 00:13:32,191
- Mm-hmm.
- To Jamaica?

320
00:13:32,226 --> 00:13:33,621
- Yeah.
- Together?

321
00:13:33,656 --> 00:13:34,721
- Yes.
- Like, everyone?

322
00:13:34,756 --> 00:13:37,163
- Yes.
- Including you?

323
00:13:37,198 --> 00:13:39,165
Yes! We are all going on
a migration to Jamaica.

324
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:40,826
In which language
should I tell you?

325
00:13:40,861 --> 00:13:43,103
Thanks, Dad.

326
00:13:43,897 --> 00:13:45,204
You're welcome.

327
00:13:45,239 --> 00:13:46,601
Oh!

328
00:13:46,636 --> 00:13:49,736
I knew there was some
adventure left in you.

329
00:13:49,771 --> 00:13:52,211
Wait, wait, wait!

330
00:13:59,253 --> 00:14:00,582
Uncle Dan, you're coming, too!

331
00:14:00,617 --> 00:14:02,199
- Gwen, no, no.
- No, no, no, no, no, no.

332
00:14:02,223 --> 00:14:03,750
We're going to Jamaica.

333
00:14:03,785 --> 00:14:06,126
No. I don't think so, kiddo.

334
00:14:06,161 --> 00:14:08,062
Oh, please, Uncle Dan.

335
00:14:08,097 --> 00:14:09,591
Nah.

336
00:14:09,626 --> 00:14:10,900
Oh, too bad he doesn't
want to come, honey.

337
00:14:10,924 --> 00:14:12,165
We tried. What else can we do?

338
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:13,595
- Let's leave.

339
00:14:15,401 --> 00:14:17,929
Please...

340
00:14:28,711 --> 00:14:30,084
Pretty please?

341
00:14:30,119 --> 00:14:31,646
Whoa. That did it.

342
00:14:31,681 --> 00:14:33,021
I can't refuse her.

343
00:14:33,056 --> 00:14:34,990
Look at her. Look
at how cute she is.

344
00:14:35,025 --> 00:14:36,849
Yes! Uncle Dan is coming!

345
00:14:36,884 --> 00:14:38,158
No, he's not.

346
00:14:38,193 --> 00:14:39,621
Uncle Dan, Uncle Dan.

347
00:14:39,656 --> 00:14:41,172
GWEN and UNCLE DAN:
Uncle Dan, Uncle Dan...

348
00:14:41,196 --> 00:14:42,129
- Oh, for real?

349
00:14:42,164 --> 00:14:43,691
Uncle Dan, Uncle Dan.

350
00:14:43,726 --> 00:14:44,802
- Uncle Dan, that's me.
- Uncle Dan, Uncle Dan.

351
00:14:44,826 --> 00:14:46,463
Yeah!

352
00:14:46,498 --> 00:14:48,135
MACK and PAM Yay.

353
00:14:54,308 --> 00:14:57,639
Here we go. Let's
do the final check.

354
00:14:57,674 --> 00:14:59,641
Tail feather torsion?

355
00:14:59,676 --> 00:15:00,676
Check.

356
00:15:00,710 --> 00:15:02,578
Wing deployment?

357
00:15:02,613 --> 00:15:03,777
Check.

358
00:15:03,812 --> 00:15:06,483
Heads in takeoff mode?

359
00:15:06,518 --> 00:15:07,682
Check.

360
00:15:08,718 --> 00:15:10,619
Let's fly.

361
00:15:29,244 --> 00:15:31,112
Woo-hoo! Yeah!

362
00:15:31,147 --> 00:15:33,972
Woo-hoo!

363
00:15:34,007 --> 00:15:36,513
Whoa! Whoo!

364
00:15:37,912 --> 00:15:40,154
Yeah!

365
00:15:44,292 --> 00:15:47,755
Okay, everyone,
enough fooling around.

366
00:15:47,790 --> 00:15:49,823
"V" formation.

367
00:15:49,858 --> 00:15:51,396
Woo-hoo! Yeah!

368
00:15:51,431 --> 00:15:53,233
- Look at me!
- Thanks, Dad!

369
00:15:53,268 --> 00:15:55,598
- Whoo!
- Yeah, this is awesome!

370
00:15:55,633 --> 00:15:58,403
Well, better get used to it.

371
00:16:07,942 --> 00:16:09,546
Huh. That's weird.

372
00:16:09,581 --> 00:16:11,416
My inner compass may
be a little rusty,

373
00:16:11,451 --> 00:16:13,814
but I'm sure we're
heading south.

374
00:16:13,849 --> 00:16:15,981
Yeah, we are, but why are we

375
00:16:16,016 --> 00:16:18,258
the only birds heading this way?

376
00:16:26,301 --> 00:16:28,059
Hey, kids, don't worry.

377
00:16:28,094 --> 00:16:29,500
We're gonna be all right.

378
00:16:29,535 --> 00:16:31,139
Here we are together.

379
00:16:31,174 --> 00:16:32,635
We're on an adventure.

380
00:16:32,670 --> 00:16:35,242
I promised adventure,
and this is exactly

381
00:16:35,277 --> 00:16:37,244
what I promised, huh?

382
00:16:39,182 --> 00:16:40,676
We're not gonna make it, are we?

383
00:16:40,711 --> 00:16:42,777
- Uncle Dan!
- You can tell me. I don't mind.

384
00:16:42,812 --> 00:16:45,153
I'm a big boy. I'm a big duck.

385
00:16:45,188 --> 00:16:47,287
No, Uncle Dan, things
are gonna be fine.

386
00:16:47,322 --> 00:16:48,948
- Isn't that right, Mack?

387
00:16:48,983 --> 00:16:50,620
Uh, I, uh...

388
00:16:50,655 --> 00:16:54,085
I mean yes, Mom's right.

389
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:55,889
This is fun.

390
00:16:55,924 --> 00:16:59,024
This is the kind of thing we'll
remember for years to come.

391
00:16:59,059 --> 00:17:01,059
We'll look back and laugh.

392
00:17:20,751 --> 00:17:22,949
- A heron.
- The one from Dad's story.

393
00:17:22,984 --> 00:17:24,687
The ultimate duck killer.

394
00:17:24,722 --> 00:17:26,293
Don't panic.

395
00:17:26,328 --> 00:17:29,329
Herons can't see their
prey if you stay still.

396
00:17:30,332 --> 00:17:33,795
Hello, little ducks.

397
00:17:33,830 --> 00:17:35,896
She's bluffing.

398
00:17:35,931 --> 00:17:40,538
So, tell me, what's a nice
little family of mallards

399
00:17:40,573 --> 00:17:44,179
doing down here
all cold and wet?

400
00:17:44,214 --> 00:17:46,478
Nothing. We're good.

401
00:17:46,513 --> 00:17:48,139
We're enjoying it.

402
00:17:48,174 --> 00:17:50,383
But you must be freezing here.

403
00:17:50,418 --> 00:17:51,648
- Oh, no, we're not.
- Come.

404
00:17:51,683 --> 00:17:53,320
- Oh, no, no, no, no, no.
- Come, come.

405
00:17:53,355 --> 00:17:57,258
Let Erin take care of you
in her comfy little nest.

406
00:18:01,561 --> 00:18:03,264
In you go. Hup, hup, hup.

407
00:18:03,299 --> 00:18:05,123
Harry!

408
00:18:05,158 --> 00:18:06,795
Harry, look.

409
00:18:06,830 --> 00:18:08,060
Look what I found.

410
00:18:08,095 --> 00:18:12,900
A nice little family
of traveling mallards.

411
00:18:12,935 --> 00:18:15,540
Mallards.

412
00:18:19,513 --> 00:18:22,250
Uh, okay. Nice meeting you all.

413
00:18:22,285 --> 00:18:23,416
Bye-bye.

414
00:18:23,451 --> 00:18:26,320
In a rush, are you?

415
00:18:26,355 --> 00:18:28,113
Oh, we don't want
to be a bother.

416
00:18:28,148 --> 00:18:31,292
You look busy decaying.

417
00:18:31,327 --> 00:18:33,921
You're not bothering at all.

418
00:18:33,956 --> 00:18:37,364
But maybe herons are not

419
00:18:37,399 --> 00:18:41,368
good enough for you, mallards?

420
00:18:41,403 --> 00:18:42,864
No, of course not.

421
00:18:42,899 --> 00:18:45,900
We're happy to stay.

422
00:18:48,410 --> 00:18:50,575
Good! Let me get
your bed ready.

423
00:18:50,610 --> 00:18:53,072
What do they do, rip
you apart, then eat you?

424
00:18:53,107 --> 00:18:54,744
- Dan.

425
00:18:54,779 --> 00:18:56,262
I don't know how they do
it. What's the method?

426
00:18:56,286 --> 00:18:58,044
- Hey. Zip it.

427
00:18:58,079 --> 00:19:00,354
Wake me up when it's
my turn to be eaten.

428
00:19:00,389 --> 00:19:02,180
- What?
- What are you doing, Pam?

429
00:19:02,215 --> 00:19:04,336
Well, I don't know. I just...
I don't want to offend them.

430
00:19:04,360 --> 00:19:05,667
Can't you see they
want to eat us?

431
00:19:05,691 --> 00:19:07,152
I don't want to be eaten!

432
00:19:07,187 --> 00:19:08,329
Well, she can't eat us.

433
00:19:08,364 --> 00:19:09,726
She doesn't have teeth.

434
00:19:09,761 --> 00:19:11,497
Well, what if she cuts
us into pieces first?

435
00:19:11,532 --> 00:19:13,224
I don't want to be
cut into piece...

436
00:19:13,259 --> 00:19:14,731
I-I-I beg your pardon?

437
00:19:14,766 --> 00:19:16,502
Oh, what's that? No, no.

438
00:19:16,537 --> 00:19:19,538
We were just saying your
nest is just so charming.

439
00:19:19,573 --> 00:19:21,309
Weren't we, kids?

440
00:19:21,344 --> 00:19:23,344
Oh, thank you.

441
00:19:23,379 --> 00:19:25,610
We moved here a few years ago.

442
00:19:25,645 --> 00:19:28,514
We used to migrate
all the time like you.

443
00:19:28,549 --> 00:19:31,484
Harry was such an adventurer.

444
00:19:31,519 --> 00:19:33,145
Fierce predator, too.

445
00:19:33,180 --> 00:19:37,358
He could catch any prey
with a single swift peck.

446
00:19:45,797 --> 00:19:49,502
Those were the good old days.

447
00:19:49,537 --> 00:19:51,999
Now Harry's too old.

448
00:19:52,034 --> 00:19:57,510
I'm the one who brings
food back to the nest.

449
00:20:00,075 --> 00:20:03,208
But, anyway, you
must be exhausted.

450
00:20:03,243 --> 00:20:04,682
Here's your bed.

451
00:20:05,850 --> 00:20:07,685
There's no way we're
sleeping in that.

452
00:20:07,720 --> 00:20:10,457
But it's our finest bed.

453
00:20:10,492 --> 00:20:11,986
And it is perfect.

454
00:20:12,021 --> 00:20:13,856
Thank you.

455
00:20:13,891 --> 00:20:15,561
Wow, huh?

456
00:20:15,596 --> 00:20:18,828
Hey, feel this. Even
comfier than our own nest.

457
00:20:18,863 --> 00:20:20,533
Yeah, sure.

458
00:20:20,568 --> 00:20:22,832
It's greasier, too. Oh!

459
00:20:23,967 --> 00:20:27,298
Looks like your last
guest is still here.

460
00:20:27,333 --> 00:20:29,267
- And dead.

461
00:20:29,302 --> 00:20:31,203
Thank you.

462
00:20:31,238 --> 00:20:33,447
You're welcome, sweethearts.

463
00:20:33,482 --> 00:20:34,778
Sleep tight.

464
00:20:34,813 --> 00:20:38,353
Don't let the bedbugs bite.

465
00:20:51,258 --> 00:20:52,763
Okay. Storm is over.

466
00:20:52,798 --> 00:20:54,765
Let's go. Kids, kids, wake up.

467
00:20:54,800 --> 00:20:56,503
- Pam, we got to go right now.
- What?

468
00:20:56,538 --> 00:20:57,867
- Right now!
- Now?

469
00:20:57,902 --> 00:20:59,737
- What about Uncle Dan?
- It's fine.

470
00:20:59,772 --> 00:21:01,233
When they wake up,
they'll eat him.

471
00:21:01,268 --> 00:21:03,070
That'll give us
more time to lose...

472
00:21:04,645 --> 00:21:06,139
You're awake.

473
00:21:06,174 --> 00:21:08,240
Looking right at us, too.

474
00:21:08,275 --> 00:21:10,143
- Bonus.
- Shh!

475
00:21:10,178 --> 00:21:14,719
You shouldn't have
gotten out of your beds.

476
00:21:14,754 --> 00:21:19,218
Nighttime is when
predators like to feed.

477
00:21:19,253 --> 00:21:20,824
Stay away from my kids.

478
00:21:20,859 --> 00:21:23,398
Let's do this quick!

479
00:21:23,433 --> 00:21:25,158
Run, kids, run!

480
00:21:25,193 --> 00:21:26,434
Let me get them!

481
00:21:28,064 --> 00:21:30,999
Harry, catch them!

482
00:21:32,541 --> 00:21:34,904
- Head for the door!

483
00:21:40,483 --> 00:21:41,977
Go, go!

484
00:21:44,883 --> 00:21:46,179
Hands off!

485
00:21:47,556 --> 00:21:49,314
- It's okay, kids.

486
00:21:49,349 --> 00:21:51,118
Just hold still.

487
00:21:51,153 --> 00:21:52,427
No, no, no, no, no.

488
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:54,924
Please don't eat us.

489
00:21:54,959 --> 00:21:56,464
We haven't finished molting yet.

490
00:21:56,499 --> 00:21:57,828
Pretty please?

491
00:21:57,863 --> 00:22:00,600
I promise you this won't hurt.

492
00:22:07,070 --> 00:22:08,575
- No!

493
00:22:10,106 --> 00:22:11,545
Gotcha!

494
00:22:11,580 --> 00:22:15,175
He was about to gulp
you in one bite.

495
00:22:15,210 --> 00:22:16,374
Bad fish.

496
00:22:16,409 --> 00:22:19,179
Ooh, bad fish!

497
00:22:20,215 --> 00:22:23,051
You... you saved them?

498
00:22:23,086 --> 00:22:24,558
Oh.

499
00:22:24,593 --> 00:22:26,054
It was nothing.

500
00:22:26,089 --> 00:22:28,991
And we have breakfast
for tomorrow.

501
00:22:29,026 --> 00:22:30,993
Right, Harry?

502
00:22:32,392 --> 00:22:35,426
Into beddy-byes now.

503
00:22:54,689 --> 00:22:56,656
Are you sure you
have to go already?

504
00:22:56,691 --> 00:22:59,659
I'll miss your kids so much.

505
00:22:59,694 --> 00:23:01,595
They are so adorable.

506
00:23:03,423 --> 00:23:07,029
Mmm. And you taste so good.

507
00:23:07,064 --> 00:23:10,329
- Maybe I'll eat you. Uh...

508
00:23:10,364 --> 00:23:11,803
I'm kidding.

509
00:23:14,500 --> 00:23:16,973
- Or am I?
- Huh?

510
00:23:17,877 --> 00:23:19,679
- It's a joke!
- Oh.

511
00:23:19,714 --> 00:23:22,077
- It's a joke.

512
00:23:22,112 --> 00:23:23,342
So funny.

513
00:23:23,377 --> 00:23:25,014
All right.

514
00:23:25,049 --> 00:23:27,412
Time to go. Thanks
for everything.

515
00:23:27,447 --> 00:23:29,557
Oh, goodbye.

516
00:23:29,592 --> 00:23:31,086
Uh, I haven't kissed
Harry goodbye!

517
00:23:31,121 --> 00:23:33,121
No, no, no, no, no, no,
no, no. Blow him a kiss.

518
00:23:33,156 --> 00:23:34,958
- MACK and GWEN: Mwah. Mwah.

519
00:23:34,993 --> 00:23:36,828
No, no, no, no, you don't
have to walk closer.

520
00:23:36,863 --> 00:23:38,357
You're good there. Bye, Harry.

521
00:23:38,392 --> 00:23:39,831
Thanks so much. Mwah.

522
00:23:39,866 --> 00:23:43,835
Don't forget, drop
by on your way back.

523
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:46,398
Whew.

524
00:23:46,433 --> 00:23:47,707
Wild night there, huh?

525
00:23:47,742 --> 00:23:50,435
Yeah.

526
00:23:50,470 --> 00:23:51,909
Yeah.

527
00:23:51,944 --> 00:23:53,416
How about when she pulled
out that pan, though?

528
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:56,474
Oh, my gosh! With the dead
fish still in the pan?

529
00:23:56,509 --> 00:23:57,981
- The dead fish.
- Terrifying.

530
00:23:58,016 --> 00:24:00,247
Right? Still, lovely birds.

531
00:24:00,282 --> 00:24:02,249
Oh, lovely.

532
00:24:02,284 --> 00:24:03,987
Lovely birds.

533
00:24:05,386 --> 00:24:07,320
Guys! Come up!

534
00:24:07,355 --> 00:24:10,290
You have to see this.

535
00:24:10,325 --> 00:24:12,127
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa. Hey, hey, hey.

536
00:24:12,162 --> 00:24:14,932
Dax, let's keep the adventure
where I can see you.

537
00:24:26,539 --> 00:24:28,506
Whoa!

538
00:24:31,280 --> 00:24:32,752
Woo-hoo! Come on!

539
00:24:32,787 --> 00:24:34,017
Try it, Dad!

540
00:24:34,052 --> 00:24:35,953
Okay, okay, this is pretty cool,

541
00:24:35,988 --> 00:24:37,691
but we should probably
get back on...

542
00:24:39,090 --> 00:24:41,728
Don't be such a
stick-in-the-mud.

543
00:24:48,638 --> 00:24:52,134
Woo-hoo!

544
00:24:52,169 --> 00:24:53,498
Whoa!

545
00:24:57,603 --> 00:24:59,614
Ah, yeah!

546
00:24:59,649 --> 00:25:01,572
- Woo-hoo!

547
00:25:01,607 --> 00:25:03,244
- Hello!

548
00:25:05,446 --> 00:25:07,479
- Peekaboo!
- Whoa! Dad!

549
00:25:16,831 --> 00:25:19,062
Ow. Hey, watch out.

550
00:25:19,097 --> 00:25:20,767
Hey!

551
00:25:21,594 --> 00:25:24,529
- Aha! Whoo!

552
00:25:24,564 --> 00:25:26,806
Gotcha! Whoo!

553
00:25:26,841 --> 00:25:29,072
That was fun.

554
00:25:29,107 --> 00:25:30,942
Let's go down before
we lose our way.

555
00:25:30,977 --> 00:25:32,570
Please, Dad, come on.

556
00:25:32,605 --> 00:25:34,110
- Just a bit more.
- Please, Dad?

557
00:25:34,145 --> 00:25:37,410
Okay, okay, just a
little bit longer.

558
00:25:37,445 --> 00:25:39,412
What is that?

559
00:27:03,806 --> 00:27:06,774
- Whoa!

560
00:27:10,879 --> 00:27:13,341
Guys, you okay?

561
00:27:13,376 --> 00:27:15,145
Yeah! What a ride.

562
00:27:15,180 --> 00:27:16,850
Let's do it again.

563
00:27:16,885 --> 00:27:18,280
Yeah!

564
00:27:18,315 --> 00:27:20,018
Your mother.

565
00:27:20,053 --> 00:27:21,613
- Where's your mother?

566
00:27:21,648 --> 00:27:23,252
Pam?

567
00:27:25,487 --> 00:27:26,827
That is not your mother.

568
00:27:26,862 --> 00:27:28,829
Up here! Fly up.

569
00:27:28,864 --> 00:27:30,930
We can see so much
better from up here.

570
00:27:30,965 --> 00:27:32,470
- Pam! Are you hurt somewhere?
- Oh! What?

571
00:27:32,494 --> 00:27:34,296
- Do you feel pain?
- I-I'm fine.

572
00:27:34,331 --> 00:27:36,012
What's your name? How many
feathers am I holding up?

573
00:27:36,036 --> 00:27:37,970
Hey. I'm fine.

574
00:27:40,766 --> 00:27:42,139
Thank goodness.

575
00:27:42,174 --> 00:27:43,668
Okay. Come on, everyone.

576
00:27:43,703 --> 00:27:47,012
Prepare for takeoff so
we can get out of...

577
00:27:48,774 --> 00:27:50,312
here.

578
00:27:51,150 --> 00:27:52,853
What is this place?

579
00:27:52,888 --> 00:27:54,448
I... I don't know.

580
00:27:54,483 --> 00:27:56,252
We've never been
this far before.

581
00:27:56,287 --> 00:27:59,552
Uncle Dan, have you
ever been here before?

582
00:27:59,587 --> 00:28:01,158
Uncle Dan?

583
00:28:01,996 --> 00:28:04,458
Hello? Guys?

584
00:28:04,493 --> 00:28:06,163
Anyone?

585
00:28:06,198 --> 00:28:08,429
I don't like heights.

586
00:28:15,845 --> 00:28:17,405
Oh, whoa!

587
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:19,473
Whoa, whoa! Whoa!

588
00:28:21,576 --> 00:28:22,773
Uncle Dan?

589
00:28:22,808 --> 00:28:24,016
Yeah, it's me!

590
00:28:24,051 --> 00:28:25,446
- It's Uncle Dan!

591
00:28:25,481 --> 00:28:28,614
Uncle Dan!

592
00:28:29,782 --> 00:28:31,782
Well, he led a good life.

593
00:28:31,817 --> 00:28:33,355
What?

594
00:28:33,390 --> 00:28:35,324
We're coming for you, Uncle Dan!

595
00:28:35,359 --> 00:28:37,326
He would have wanted us
to go on without him.

596
00:28:37,361 --> 00:28:40,758
Come on, he was kind like that.

597
00:28:56,809 --> 00:28:58,215
Ow!

598
00:28:59,284 --> 00:29:01,988
Oh. Well, hello there.

599
00:29:04,025 --> 00:29:06,927
- Ah...

600
00:29:14,497 --> 00:29:15,694
Get away, get away!

601
00:29:17,797 --> 00:29:19,830
Pigeons.

602
00:29:19,865 --> 00:29:21,667
Mmm.

603
00:29:21,702 --> 00:29:23,075
Ah...

604
00:29:24,870 --> 00:29:28,542
Uncle Dan! Uncle Dan!

605
00:29:29,413 --> 00:29:31,182
- Uncle Dan!
- Uncle Dan!

606
00:29:31,217 --> 00:29:32,843
- Uncle Dan, where are you?
- Uncle Dan!

607
00:29:32,878 --> 00:29:34,086
Uncle Dan?

608
00:29:34,121 --> 00:29:35,549
What if something ate Uncle Dan?

609
00:29:35,584 --> 00:29:37,518
Honey, I promise you,
nothing would ever

610
00:29:37,553 --> 00:29:38,926
want to eat Uncle Dan.

611
00:29:38,961 --> 00:29:41,093
- Uncle Dan.

612
00:29:41,128 --> 00:29:43,392
Get off me!

613
00:29:43,427 --> 00:29:45,790
I'm coming!

614
00:29:45,825 --> 00:29:48,364
- Hey, wait! Wait!

615
00:29:48,399 --> 00:29:50,102
Get away from me!
Get away from me!

616
00:29:50,137 --> 00:29:52,038
It's my sandwich.

617
00:29:52,073 --> 00:29:53,501
I licked it, I licked it!

618
00:29:53,536 --> 00:29:55,085
You can't touch it
with duck spit on it.

619
00:29:55,109 --> 00:29:56,240
Uncle Dan!

620
00:29:56,275 --> 00:29:58,374
Get your wings off my uncle!

621
00:29:59,641 --> 00:30:01,113
Dax, Gwen, wait!

622
00:30:01,148 --> 00:30:02,411
Stay away from my family!

623
00:30:02,446 --> 00:30:04,281
Back away! Back
away! Back away!

624
00:30:04,316 --> 00:30:07,482
Get out of here, you
trashy, trashy vermin!

625
00:30:10,817 --> 00:30:13,389
PIGEON Who said that?

626
00:30:15,591 --> 00:30:20,693
I asked, "Who said that?"

627
00:30:23,896 --> 00:30:25,907
Huh?

628
00:30:36,810 --> 00:30:38,579
Come here, bumpkin.

629
00:30:38,614 --> 00:30:40,878
Uh... Oh.

630
00:30:45,819 --> 00:30:47,720
Say it again.

631
00:30:47,755 --> 00:30:49,656
Uh, which part?

632
00:30:49,691 --> 00:30:53,462
"Trashy, trashy vermin."

633
00:30:53,497 --> 00:30:56,564
Let the record reflect I just
meant to say "trashy vermin."

634
00:30:57,831 --> 00:30:59,600
Which I'm not
saying that's good,

635
00:30:59,635 --> 00:31:02,977
but I wasn't doubling
down on "trashy," vermin.

636
00:31:04,376 --> 00:31:07,443
You ducks make me
sick, you know that?

637
00:31:08,479 --> 00:31:11,414
You're fed all day by
the humans in the park,

638
00:31:11,449 --> 00:31:13,218
but that's not enough for you.

639
00:31:13,253 --> 00:31:14,549
No, no, no.

640
00:31:14,584 --> 00:31:17,123
You got to come
to our territory.

641
00:31:17,158 --> 00:31:19,158
You got to steal our food.

642
00:31:19,193 --> 00:31:21,490
And then you insult us?

643
00:31:21,525 --> 00:31:23,030
What? No, no, no,
no, I wasn't...

644
00:31:23,065 --> 00:31:24,658
- Name!
- Uh, Mack.

645
00:31:26,266 --> 00:31:30,037
Well, "Uh, Mack," I'm the Chump,

646
00:31:30,072 --> 00:31:33,700
and I'm the leader of this
group of hardworking birds

647
00:31:33,735 --> 00:31:35,438
you just called vermin.

648
00:31:38,245 --> 00:31:39,838
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

649
00:31:39,873 --> 00:31:41,312
So listen, Chump...

650
00:31:41,347 --> 00:31:42,643
- What did you just call me?

651
00:31:42,678 --> 00:31:44,612
Sorry. I thought
your name was Chump.

652
00:31:44,647 --> 00:31:46,163
Yeah, Chump, yeah.
That's my name. Why?

653
00:31:46,187 --> 00:31:47,615
Right. So listen, Chump...

654
00:31:47,650 --> 00:31:49,386
- What did you just call me?!
- I'm sorry.

655
00:31:49,421 --> 00:31:51,916
Is everyone else
hearing "Chump" or...

656
00:31:51,951 --> 00:31:53,423
- What did... What?
- Okay, okay.

657
00:31:53,458 --> 00:31:56,063
I think there's a slight
misunderstanding here.

658
00:31:56,098 --> 00:31:57,427
Excuse me. Will you excuse me?

659
00:31:57,462 --> 00:31:58,923
Coming through.
Uh-huh. Thank you.

660
00:31:58,958 --> 00:32:00,991
Okay. Hi there. I'm Pam.

661
00:32:01,026 --> 00:32:03,334
I'm sharing my life with
him, so I'm painfully aware

662
00:32:03,369 --> 00:32:05,732
of all the stupid things
that come out of his mouth.

663
00:32:05,767 --> 00:32:06,931
Hmm?

664
00:32:06,966 --> 00:32:08,339
Oh, yeah, that's true. She is.

665
00:32:08,374 --> 00:32:11,177
But I assure you,
he meant no harm.

666
00:32:11,212 --> 00:32:12,574
And to show our gratitude

667
00:32:12,609 --> 00:32:14,147
for your understanding
in this matter,

668
00:32:14,182 --> 00:32:18,250
how about we share
the sandwich 50-50?

669
00:32:22,388 --> 00:32:25,158
- 80-20.
- 60-40.

670
00:32:25,193 --> 00:32:27,017
- 70-30.
- 65-35.

671
00:32:27,052 --> 00:32:29,657
- 68-32!
- 67-33!

672
00:32:30,924 --> 00:32:32,297
You got yourself a deal.

673
00:32:32,332 --> 00:32:34,431
Uncle Dan, cut the sandwich.

674
00:32:34,466 --> 00:32:36,103
Uh...

675
00:32:37,403 --> 00:32:39,634
You don't want to
try 50-50 again?

676
00:32:39,669 --> 00:32:42,208
- Uncle Dan!
- All right, all right.

677
00:32:46,610 --> 00:32:48,038
You, I like.

678
00:32:48,073 --> 00:32:49,611
Thank you, Chump.

679
00:32:49,646 --> 00:32:51,844
Sorry for busting your
bills over here, but, uh...

680
00:32:51,879 --> 00:32:55,221
sometimes I get
sensitive, is all.

681
00:32:55,256 --> 00:32:57,091
Us pigeons, we got
big hearts, too.

682
00:32:57,126 --> 00:32:58,455
Ain't that right, guys?

683
00:32:58,490 --> 00:33:00,457
- Oh, for sure.

684
00:33:00,492 --> 00:33:03,196
- We just want to be loved.
- And respected.

685
00:33:04,958 --> 00:33:06,265
Yeah.

686
00:33:06,300 --> 00:33:09,400
So anything you need...
I mean anything...

687
00:33:09,435 --> 00:33:10,863
Chump's got ya.

688
00:33:10,898 --> 00:33:13,569
Oh, really? Because we
are completely lost.

689
00:33:13,604 --> 00:33:15,274
We're trying to get to Jamaica.

690
00:33:15,309 --> 00:33:17,001
Oh, yeah, yeah. That's
in Queens, right?

691
00:33:17,036 --> 00:33:18,343
Uh, more south.

692
00:33:18,378 --> 00:33:19,872
Uh, like, the Caribbean.

693
00:33:19,907 --> 00:33:22,072
Oh, that Jamaica.

694
00:33:22,107 --> 00:33:23,579
I got a buddy who
knows that place

695
00:33:23,614 --> 00:33:25,185
like the back of his wing.

696
00:33:25,220 --> 00:33:27,649
You-you think he'll help us?

697
00:33:27,684 --> 00:33:30,487
Yeah. I mean, it's a bit
of a sore subject for him,

698
00:33:30,522 --> 00:33:32,786
but, uh, I'm sure it
won't be a problem.

699
00:33:32,821 --> 00:33:35,129
Come on, lovebirds,
we ain't got all day.

700
00:33:35,164 --> 00:33:36,460
It's this way.

701
00:33:36,495 --> 00:33:39,595
Wow. Mom, you rock.

702
00:33:39,630 --> 00:33:40,563
Yeah.

703
00:33:40,598 --> 00:33:43,027
- 60-40!
- 70-30!

704
00:33:43,062 --> 00:33:44,600
60,000-3,500!

705
00:33:44,635 --> 00:33:46,932
I didn't know you
could be so tough.

706
00:33:46,967 --> 00:33:49,605
Really, Mack?! You
didn't know that?

707
00:33:49,640 --> 00:33:51,068
Oh, no, I...

708
00:33:52,610 --> 00:33:53,510
Oh!

709
00:33:53,545 --> 00:33:55,072
I get it.

710
00:33:55,107 --> 00:33:56,876
That's good.

711
00:33:56,911 --> 00:33:58,350
That's very good.

712
00:34:00,948 --> 00:34:02,519
Okay, my little bumpkins,

713
00:34:02,554 --> 00:34:04,323
- let's get a move on. Whoa.

714
00:34:04,358 --> 00:34:06,226
Are you kidding? We
are not flying through

715
00:34:06,261 --> 00:34:08,459
this crazy death
trap of a city again.

716
00:34:08,494 --> 00:34:10,461
Oh, come on. It's nothing.

717
00:34:10,496 --> 00:34:12,166
Just stick close to me,

718
00:34:12,201 --> 00:34:14,696
and everything
will be all right.

719
00:34:21,133 --> 00:34:23,441
I'm okay. Yeah, no, I'm okay!

720
00:34:24,939 --> 00:34:26,741
- Yeah.

721
00:34:28,140 --> 00:34:29,975
I'm okay.

722
00:34:30,010 --> 00:34:31,317
I'm still okay.

723
00:34:31,352 --> 00:34:32,813
- We can do this.

724
00:34:32,848 --> 00:34:34,078
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

725
00:34:34,113 --> 00:34:36,322
Ha-ha! You missed, bus!

726
00:34:41,087 --> 00:34:43,296
Maybe don't stick too close.

727
00:34:54,342 --> 00:34:57,310
- Whoa.
- Whoa.

728
00:35:04,715 --> 00:35:06,352
Aw.

729
00:35:06,387 --> 00:35:08,112
Here you go, my little princess.

730
00:35:08,147 --> 00:35:10,015
Thank you!

731
00:35:10,050 --> 00:35:11,357
- Woo-hoo!

732
00:35:11,392 --> 00:35:13,656
Whoa, Gwen! I got you, Gwen.

733
00:35:13,691 --> 00:35:15,691
I got you.

734
00:35:15,726 --> 00:35:18,298
Look! Look, there it is.

735
00:35:18,333 --> 00:35:20,630
That's Jamaica.

736
00:35:24,163 --> 00:35:26,339
What?

737
00:35:42,786 --> 00:35:44,390
Here we are.

738
00:35:44,425 --> 00:35:46,854
Okay, so...

739
00:35:46,889 --> 00:35:49,329
Wait, where's our guy?

740
00:35:50,156 --> 00:35:52,123
And what is that?

741
00:35:52,158 --> 00:35:54,092
Huh? Oh, that?

742
00:35:54,127 --> 00:35:56,094
Don't worry about it.

743
00:35:56,129 --> 00:35:58,096
But I should probably warn you,

744
00:35:58,131 --> 00:36:00,934
Delroy's owner is a chef.

745
00:36:00,969 --> 00:36:02,342
A-A chef?

746
00:36:02,377 --> 00:36:03,838
Yeah. A-A chef.

747
00:36:03,873 --> 00:36:06,445
Like a predator except
instead of eating you,

748
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:09,041
he feeds you to a group
of much lazier predators.

749
00:36:09,076 --> 00:36:10,977
Right this way.

750
00:36:18,756 --> 00:36:20,525
After you.

751
00:36:31,967 --> 00:36:33,307
Hey. Shh!

752
00:36:38,941 --> 00:36:40,171
Coast is clear.

753
00:36:41,416 --> 00:36:43,482
Hey, Delroy.

754
00:36:43,517 --> 00:36:45,451
How's it going?
It's been a while.

755
00:36:45,486 --> 00:36:47,420
You look good. Slip
me some feather.

756
00:36:47,455 --> 00:36:49,356
I brought you a nice
family of mallards.

757
00:36:49,391 --> 00:36:51,358
They need to ask you something.

758
00:36:55,122 --> 00:36:59,058
Oh. Well, Mr. Delroy,

759
00:36:59,093 --> 00:37:01,764
so nice to meet you.

760
00:37:01,799 --> 00:37:04,437
Do you know the way to Jamaica?

761
00:37:06,265 --> 00:37:09,167
Do I know the way to Jamaica?

762
00:37:09,202 --> 00:37:10,509
Told ya.

763
00:37:10,544 --> 00:37:11,785
He's a little
sensitive about it.

764
00:37:11,809 --> 00:37:14,073
He was born and raised there.

765
00:37:14,108 --> 00:37:15,613
What happened?

766
00:37:15,648 --> 00:37:18,308
The chef snatched him up
in the middle of the night.

767
00:37:18,343 --> 00:37:22,246
Next day, old Del's gone
from free bird to jailbird.

768
00:37:22,281 --> 00:37:23,555
Come on, D.

769
00:37:23,590 --> 00:37:25,656
Just tell them how to get there.

770
00:37:27,990 --> 00:37:30,793
Fly to the big green statue,
fly due south for three miles,

771
00:37:30,828 --> 00:37:33,598
then due east for one mile,
due west for ten miles,

772
00:37:33,633 --> 00:37:34,929
then you southwest for one mile,

773
00:37:34,964 --> 00:37:36,568
south-southeast for two miles...
-Uh...

774
00:37:36,603 --> 00:37:39,098
and south-southwest for
the rest of the way.

775
00:37:39,133 --> 00:37:42,134
And don't stop until
you see that mist

776
00:37:42,169 --> 00:37:46,512
dancing atop the
beautiful blue mountains.

777
00:37:46,547 --> 00:37:49,614
You can't miss it.

778
00:37:53,114 --> 00:37:55,246
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.
No, don't cry, Big Red.

779
00:37:55,281 --> 00:37:57,556
It's all right. We
didn't mean to upset you.

780
00:37:57,591 --> 00:38:00,559
Jamaica!

781
00:38:02,530 --> 00:38:04,354
I miss my family.

782
00:38:04,389 --> 00:38:05,564
Devon.

783
00:38:05,599 --> 00:38:07,192
And likkle Donnie.

784
00:38:07,227 --> 00:38:09,733
Dolores. Deedee.

785
00:38:09,768 --> 00:38:12,934
Winston!

786
00:38:12,969 --> 00:38:14,474
That me cousin.

787
00:38:14,509 --> 00:38:18,577
Dad, we're not really gonna
leave him here, are we?

788
00:38:18,612 --> 00:38:21,580
He looks so cramped
in that cage.

789
00:38:21,615 --> 00:38:23,274
- Come on, blow it out.

790
00:38:23,309 --> 00:38:25,419
- Blow.

791
00:38:27,247 --> 00:38:29,181
There's nothing we
can do here, Dax.

792
00:38:29,216 --> 00:38:30,787
We could get the key.

793
00:38:30,822 --> 00:38:33,350
No, kid. That's impossible.

794
00:38:33,385 --> 00:38:35,187
Why? Where is it?

795
00:38:35,222 --> 00:38:37,255
Down there.

796
00:38:37,290 --> 00:38:39,763
The chef keeps that key
on him at all times.

797
00:38:39,798 --> 00:38:42,326
And trust me, you
don't want to go

798
00:38:42,361 --> 00:38:44,537
anywhere near that lunatic.

799
00:38:44,572 --> 00:38:49,366
Him catch ya, him turn
you into duck à l'orange.

800
00:38:49,401 --> 00:38:51,038
What's duck à l'orange?

801
00:38:51,073 --> 00:38:54,404
It's you with l'orange on top.

802
00:38:55,913 --> 00:38:58,078
You know what?
Guys, don't worry.

803
00:38:58,113 --> 00:39:00,454
- I'll go get it.
- Uh, what? No, no, no, no, no.

804
00:39:00,489 --> 00:39:01,851
Dad, it's okay. I've got this.

805
00:39:01,886 --> 00:39:03,622
No, you don't got this.

806
00:39:03,657 --> 00:39:06,251
But just because you're scared
of everything in the world

807
00:39:06,286 --> 00:39:08,154
doesn't mean I have to be.

808
00:39:11,093 --> 00:39:12,862
Okay. You know what?

809
00:39:12,897 --> 00:39:14,468
I will go get the key.

810
00:39:14,503 --> 00:39:15,931
Cool. I'm coming with you.

811
00:39:15,966 --> 00:39:17,801
- No. You stay.
- Dad!

812
00:39:17,836 --> 00:39:20,771
Ah-ah-ah. Stay here.

813
00:40:09,184 --> 00:40:10,557
Hmm?

814
00:40:14,189 --> 00:40:15,254
Huh?

815
00:41:03,645 --> 00:41:05,535
- How's it going?

816
00:41:05,570 --> 00:41:07,405
Shh! What are you doing here?

817
00:41:07,440 --> 00:41:09,176
I told you to stay back there.

818
00:41:09,211 --> 00:41:11,310
Oh, there's no way I'm
letting you have all the fun.

819
00:41:11,345 --> 00:41:12,586
Let's go.

820
00:41:18,759 --> 00:41:20,594
There.

821
00:41:20,629 --> 00:41:21,925
Here.

822
00:41:21,960 --> 00:41:23,597
Grab my tail so I
can get the key.

823
00:41:23,632 --> 00:41:25,225
Hurry.

824
00:41:37,910 --> 00:41:39,140
- Pam.
- Almost there.

825
00:41:39,175 --> 00:41:40,175
Look.

826
00:41:42,145 --> 00:41:44,750
- Pam.
- Almost there.

827
00:41:47,051 --> 00:41:49,084
- Pam.
- A little closer.

828
00:41:49,614 --> 00:41:51,086
Pam!

829
00:41:52,122 --> 00:41:53,319

- Here.

Okay. Let's do this.

873
00:44:37,958 --> 00:44:39,353
Hurry! Hurry!

874
00:44:39,388 --> 00:44:40,937
No, more to the right.
To the right, and twist.

875
00:44:40,961 --> 00:44:42,169
No, no, no, no,
no. My right, Dad.

876
00:44:42,193 --> 00:44:43,456
- Mack! -Down, down.
- No, push.

877
00:44:43,491 --> 00:44:44,963
- No, to the right.
- That's it!

878
00:44:44,998 --> 00:44:46,173
- Now, hold it and twist it.
- No, Dad.

879
00:44:46,197 --> 00:44:47,207
- Come on!
- Do I just have to do it?

880
00:44:47,231 --> 00:44:48,428
- Push!

881
00:44:48,463 --> 00:44:49,902
Oh. What happened?

882
00:44:51,367 --> 00:44:53,939
Wait, wh-where's the
k... Where's the key?

883
00:44:53,974 --> 00:44:55,809
- I swallowed it.
- Oh, that's a bummer.

884
00:44:55,844 --> 00:44:57,668
Spit it out. You
need to spit it out!

885
00:44:57,703 --> 00:44:59,043
I'm on it. I'm on it.

886
00:44:59,078 --> 00:45:01,408
- Come on, Mack.

887
00:45:01,443 --> 00:45:04,774
Okay, he's really close,
and he really looks mad.

888
00:45:07,284 --> 00:45:08,822
- Mack!

889
00:45:08,857 --> 00:45:11,891
- Spit it out already.
- Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no!

890
00:45:13,620 --> 00:45:16,159
Come on! Hurry up!

891
00:45:19,230 --> 00:45:21,230
Come on, kids.

893
00:45:22,596 --> 00:45:24,662
Spit it out!

894
00:45:24,697 --> 00:45:26,433
This isn't working!

895
00:45:26,468 --> 00:45:29,700

896
00:46:28,970 --> 00:46:30,398

00:46:43,578 --> 00:46:45,952
Ya mon!

901
00:46:49,551 --> 00:46:51,782
We did it!

902
00:46:57,823 --> 00:46:59,999
Thank you!

903
00:47:02,201 --> 00:47:04,102
Whoo! Oh, you did it.

904
00:47:04,137 --> 00:47:05,367
I can't believe it.

905
00:47:05,402 --> 00:47:07,666
I was in a cage,
and now I'm not.

906
00:47:07,701 --> 00:47:09,173
In, and now not.

907
00:47:09,208 --> 00:47:11,406
And you did it!

908
00:47:11,441 --> 00:47:12,671
All of you.

909
00:47:12,706 --> 00:47:14,310
But you...

910
00:47:14,345 --> 00:47:16,345
- you wild duck, you.

911
00:47:16,380 --> 00:47:18,677
You must be the bravest
duck me ever meet.

912
00:47:18,712 --> 00:47:20,019
Oh, I'm not that...

913
00:47:21,451 --> 00:47:22,681
I'm not that brave.

914
00:47:22,716 --> 00:47:24,155
What?! You knew the danger.

915
00:47:24,190 --> 00:47:26,289
You did it anyway.
What do you call that?

916
00:47:26,324 --> 00:47:27,851
Yeah, you're right.

917
00:47:27,886 --> 00:47:31,459
I guess that is the only
word that describes who I am.

918
00:47:31,494 --> 00:47:34,132
Did you hear that?
He called me brave.

919
00:47:34,167 --> 00:47:36,101
So you want to go
to my island, eh?

920
00:47:36,136 --> 00:47:38,367
I will be honored to
take you there myself.

921
00:47:38,402 --> 00:47:40,171
You'd do that?

922
00:47:40,206 --> 00:47:42,866
For you, me do anything,

923
00:47:42,901 --> 00:47:46,903
because I can do anything!

924
00:47:46,938 --> 00:47:48,212
Woo-hoo!

925
00:47:48,247 --> 00:47:50,940
I can go here, or
I could go here.

926
00:47:50,975 --> 00:47:53,052
Free as a bird!

927
00:47:53,087 --> 00:47:54,317
Right.

928
00:47:54,352 --> 00:47:58,024
'Cause I'm a bird!

929
00:47:59,423 --> 00:48:02,457
I didn't think I'd
ever say this, but, uh,

930
00:48:02,492 --> 00:48:05,361
you are one heck of a bird.

931
00:48:05,396 --> 00:48:07,528
Oh. Well, thanks, Chump.

932
00:48:07,563 --> 00:48:10,102
You're not so bad yourself.

933
00:48:11,897 --> 00:48:14,238
Yeah, you know, I'm getting
a little waterwork-y up here.

934
00:48:14,273 --> 00:48:16,240
Scram, you crazy ducks.

935
00:48:16,275 --> 00:48:17,868
Get out of here.

936
00:48:17,903 --> 00:48:19,243
- Bye, Chump.
- Bye-bye, Chump.

937
00:48:19,278 --> 00:48:20,706
- Bye, Chump.
- Thank you!

938
00:48:20,741 --> 00:48:21,971
Thanks for everything.

939
00:48:22,006 --> 00:48:23,544
So long, Chump.

940
00:48:23,579 --> 00:48:26,580
Don't forget where
you got that sandwich.

941
00:48:30,058 --> 00:48:32,058
Bye-bye, you country bumpkins.

942
00:48:32,093 --> 00:48:33,950
I love you.

943
00:48:54,676 --> 00:48:56,379
I can't believe it!

944
00:48:56,414 --> 00:48:58,447
In a few hours, we'll
reach the coast.

945
00:48:58,482 --> 00:49:00,284
Then a little hop
over the ocean,

946
00:49:00,319 --> 00:49:03,287
and we'll finally
get to my homeland!

947
00:49:03,322 --> 00:49:05,718
Hey, uh, Delroy, uh, is it true

948
00:49:05,753 --> 00:49:08,820
that the sea glows
at night in Jamaica?

949
00:49:08,855 --> 00:49:12,329
Because that sounds
incredibly magical.

950
00:49:12,364 --> 00:49:14,067
Ah.

951
00:49:14,102 --> 00:49:15,662
You hear about that, eh?

952
00:49:15,697 --> 00:49:18,632
Whatever you're
expecting over there...

953
00:49:18,667 --> 00:49:21,701
it's going to be even better.

954
00:49:23,111 --> 00:49:26,739
Jamaica, I'm coming home!

955
00:49:26,774 --> 00:49:29,280
- ♪ I'm coming, I'm coming ♪
- Mom?

956
00:49:29,315 --> 00:49:31,282
- ♪ I'm coming home. ♪
- Hmm?

957
00:49:32,681 --> 00:49:33,812
It's really bad.

958
00:49:33,847 --> 00:49:35,451
Oh. It's okay, Gwen.

959
00:49:35,486 --> 00:49:37,090
You can do it while we fly.

960
00:49:37,125 --> 00:49:39,290
Here? But anyone could see me.

961
00:49:39,325 --> 00:49:41,017
No one's watching, Gwen.

962
00:49:41,052 --> 00:49:42,920
You know what?
I'll go up front.

963
00:49:42,955 --> 00:49:44,889
- What's happening?

964
00:49:44,924 --> 00:49:46,429
We have a number two situation.

965
00:49:46,464 --> 00:49:47,727
Oh.

966
00:49:47,762 --> 00:49:49,410
- Everything okay back there?
- Dad! Don't look!

967
00:49:49,434 --> 00:49:50,939
- Oh! Sorry, Gwen.
- What are you doing?

968
00:49:50,963 --> 00:49:52,468
My bad. My bad.

969
00:49:52,503 --> 00:49:54,767
Mom, I can't do it here.

970
00:49:54,802 --> 00:49:56,109
Can we land?

971
00:49:56,144 --> 00:49:57,473
No, we won't land, Gwen.

972
00:49:57,508 --> 00:49:59,079
You're old enough to
do it in the sky now.

973
00:49:59,103 --> 00:50:02,313
But it's too much
pressure, and it's gross.

974
00:50:02,348 --> 00:50:04,216
It's not gross. We're birds.

975
00:50:04,251 --> 00:50:05,877
Every bird does it in the sky.

976
00:50:05,912 --> 00:50:07,978
What if someone is
looking down there?

977
00:50:08,013 --> 00:50:09,584
No one is looking down there.

978
00:50:09,619 --> 00:50:11,256
I told you, we are not landing.

979
00:50:11,291 --> 00:50:13,390
There is no way we're landing.

980
00:50:14,723 --> 00:50:16,393
Are you sure no one's watching?

981
00:50:16,428 --> 00:50:17,592
Gwen Mallard!

982
00:50:17,627 --> 00:50:19,330
Do it now or we
leave without you.

983
00:50:19,365 --> 00:50:21,057
- Okay, okay.
- Ugh!

984
00:50:21,092 --> 00:50:22,641
She's perfectly capable of
doing her business in the sky,

985
00:50:22,665 --> 00:50:24,038
- and yet here we are.
- It's okay, Pam.

986
00:50:24,062 --> 00:50:25,369
Just let her be.

987
00:50:25,404 --> 00:50:27,063
Does anybody have a soft moss?

988
00:50:27,098 --> 00:50:28,966
Just use a leaf!

989
00:50:30,541 --> 00:50:32,343
Someone's watching!
Someone's watching!

990
00:50:32,378 --> 00:50:34,708
- There! Someone's watching!
- Where? Where?

991
00:50:37,680 --> 00:50:39,108
Huh.

992
00:50:48,152 --> 00:50:49,525
Hmm.

993
00:50:49,560 --> 00:50:52,495
Follow me, and stay close.

994
00:50:52,530 --> 00:50:54,431
Whoa! For real, Dad?

995
00:50:55,269 --> 00:50:56,565
Mm-hmm.

996
00:50:56,600 --> 00:50:57,533
Cool.

997
00:50:57,568 --> 00:50:59,238
I like your spirit, duck man.

998
00:50:59,273 --> 00:51:00,998
- Um...

999
00:51:01,033 --> 00:51:03,440
- Hmm. Guys?

1000
00:51:04,740 --> 00:51:06,377
Mm-hmm.

1001
00:51:06,412 --> 00:51:08,280
Uh, are you sure this is safe?

1002
00:51:08,315 --> 00:51:09,710
Don't worry.

1003
00:51:09,745 --> 00:51:12,108
That wild duck is on
a journey of the soul,

1004
00:51:12,143 --> 00:51:13,813
and I say we follow him.

1005
00:51:13,848 --> 00:51:16,145
But just in case,
get out your talons.

1006
00:51:17,621 --> 00:51:20,292
I ain't sure ducks
have talons, though.

1007
00:51:20,327 --> 00:51:22,294
Shh, shh.

1008
00:51:31,602 --> 00:51:34,438
GOOGOO Now stretch your back

1009
00:51:34,473 --> 00:51:38,970
and move your wings
up to the sky.

1010
00:51:39,005 --> 00:51:40,807
Breathe in.

1011
00:51:40,842 --> 00:51:46,842
- And breathe out.

1012
00:51:46,914 --> 00:51:49,585
Excellent, class.

1013
00:51:49,620 --> 00:51:52,819
And now the egg position.

1014
00:51:55,461 --> 00:51:57,428
And we hatch

1015
00:51:57,463 --> 00:52:01,399
with a newborn quack.

1016
00:52:01,434 --> 00:52:03,632
Quack.

1017
00:52:03,667 --> 00:52:05,271
Very good.

1018
00:52:05,306 --> 00:52:06,932
And repeat.

1019
00:52:06,967 --> 00:52:09,473
Quack.

1020
00:52:09,508 --> 00:52:11,607
And repeat. Quack.

1021
00:52:11,642 --> 00:52:13,675
And repeat.

1022
00:52:13,710 --> 00:52:15,644
Hey, what's going on here?

1023
00:52:15,679 --> 00:52:17,811
- Visitors!

1024
00:52:19,947 --> 00:52:21,485
Brothers, brothers.

1025
00:52:21,520 --> 00:52:23,212
Sisters, hold your enthusiasm.

1026
00:52:23,247 --> 00:52:26,083
We-we don't want to scare
our guests away, do we?

1027
00:52:26,118 --> 00:52:28,217
Hello, friends.

1028
00:52:28,252 --> 00:52:29,691
I am Googoo.

1029
00:52:29,726 --> 00:52:32,595
Welcome to our humble abode.

1030
00:52:32,630 --> 00:52:35,433
Abode? What is going on here?

1031
00:52:35,468 --> 00:52:37,666
Our morning relaxation

1032
00:52:37,701 --> 00:52:41,307
as we prepare for the
glorious Earl and Mae

1033
00:52:41,342 --> 00:52:44,706
to open the gates to paradise.

1034
00:52:44,741 --> 00:52:47,005
- Oh, you're so lucky.

1035
00:52:47,040 --> 00:52:48,842
You're just in time.

1036
00:53:01,329 --> 00:53:02,955
My friends...

1037
00:53:02,990 --> 00:53:07,366
welcome to the
Garden of Harmony.

1038
00:53:15,904 --> 00:53:18,410
I don't understand. It's...

1039
00:53:18,445 --> 00:53:20,269
Heaven for ducks?

1040
00:53:20,304 --> 00:53:21,809
Yep, pretty much.

1041
00:53:37,827 --> 00:53:39,992
Ah. Perfect.

1042
00:53:41,028 --> 00:53:42,126
Whee!

1043
00:53:56,846 --> 00:54:00,243
You came to the perfect
place, my friends.

1044
00:54:00,278 --> 00:54:05,116
Here, humans spare no
expense on our well-being.

1045
00:54:05,151 --> 00:54:08,218
And they just finished
building our brand-new slide.

1046
00:54:08,253 --> 00:54:10,187
Yeah!

1047
00:54:10,222 --> 00:54:12,288
So please be our guest.

1048
00:54:12,323 --> 00:54:14,565
Feel free to enjoy our place

1049
00:54:14,600 --> 00:54:16,831
- for as long as you like.

1050
00:54:16,866 --> 00:54:18,602
Whoa.

1051
00:54:18,637 --> 00:54:22,100
Well, I guess we could
take the afternoon.

1052
00:54:23,774 --> 00:54:25,521
- Come on. Please.
- Come on. Come on, Dad, please.

1053
00:54:25,545 --> 00:54:27,248
- Come on. Let's stay. Stay.
- Please, please.

1054
00:54:27,272 --> 00:54:28,744
Oh, no. No, no, no.

1055
00:54:28,779 --> 00:54:30,419
I don't think we can
possibly stay here...

1056
00:54:31,848 --> 00:54:35,047
without having the
best time of our lives!

1057
00:54:35,082 --> 00:54:37,280
Now, get out there
and have some fun.

1058
00:54:38,822 --> 00:54:40,591
Slides, here I
come! Wait for me!

1059
00:54:40,626 --> 00:54:42,989
Slippy slides!

1060
00:54:47,160 --> 00:54:49,501
Woo-hoo! Whoa!

1061
00:54:55,674 --> 00:54:58,939
Here comes the sea dragon!

1062
00:55:03,913 --> 00:55:05,583
We're gonna get you!

1063
00:55:05,618 --> 00:55:07,783
We're gonna squish
your sea dragon face!

1064
00:55:07,818 --> 00:55:09,785
Sea dragon is hungry.

1065
00:55:09,820 --> 00:55:11,248
Hi-yah!

1066
00:55:13,219 --> 00:55:15,659
We need to slay the sea dragon!

1067
00:55:17,058 --> 00:55:18,563
Ow. Gwen.

1068
00:55:18,598 --> 00:55:20,158
- Gwen, be more careful.

1069
00:55:20,193 --> 00:55:22,226
- We need to slay him gently.

1070
00:55:22,261 --> 00:55:24,129
Really? Okay.

1071
00:55:27,101 --> 00:55:28,507
Ow! Uncle Dan.

1072
00:55:28,542 --> 00:55:30,509
What? I want to play, too.

1073
00:55:30,544 --> 00:55:32,742
Sea dragon needs a break.

1074
00:55:32,777 --> 00:55:35,041
- Ow! Gwen!

1075
00:55:55,459 --> 00:55:58,570
Brothers, sisters, great news!

1076
00:55:58,605 --> 00:56:01,606
Earl and Mae are taking
us on a field trip.

1077
00:56:01,641 --> 00:56:03,542
- I'm so excited.

1078
00:56:03,577 --> 00:56:05,137
It's so great. Hurry, guys.

1079
00:56:05,172 --> 00:56:06,303
Hurry. It's time.

1080
00:56:06,338 --> 00:56:08,305
You don't want to miss this.

1081
00:56:08,340 --> 00:56:10,373
Come on, everyone. Let's go.

1082
00:56:14,049 --> 00:56:16,049
No! No, no, no, no, no, no, no!

1083
00:56:16,084 --> 00:56:18,282
I'm so excited. I can't
wait to get started.

1084
00:56:18,317 --> 00:56:19,756
Googoo, stop!

1085
00:56:19,791 --> 00:56:21,450
What is it, my little friend?

1086
00:56:21,485 --> 00:56:22,924
The-the chef. The-the...

1087
00:56:24,422 --> 00:56:26,125
You want to come, too?

1088
00:56:26,160 --> 00:56:28,028
- Come on. Let's go.
- You got to stop.

1089
00:56:28,063 --> 00:56:30,569
- Last one is a rotten egg.
- Googoo! Stop!

1090
00:56:30,604 --> 00:56:32,010
- Googoo!
- Kneel, sea dragon, kneel!

1091
00:56:32,034 --> 00:56:33,770
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, Gwenny.

1092
00:56:33,805 --> 00:56:35,145
- Googoo, no! Stop!
- No. Don't hit your father.

1093
00:56:35,169 --> 00:56:36,806
- What?
- We're not hitting fathers.

1094
00:56:36,841 --> 00:56:38,511
Googoo! Googoo!
- Where are you going?

1095
00:56:38,546 --> 00:56:40,711
Uh, Delroy is the
sea dragon now.

1096
00:56:40,746 --> 00:56:42,647
Of course. I'd love that.

1097
00:56:42,682 --> 00:56:44,176
- You're next!
- No, no, no.

1098
00:56:44,211 --> 00:56:45,749
You're gonna be gentle. Okay, no...
-

1099
00:56:45,784 --> 00:56:47,080
- Ow!
- Gwenny, come on!

1100
00:56:47,115 --> 00:56:48,818
- He said "gently."

1101
00:56:48,853 --> 00:56:50,193
Googoo, he's gonna take
you to his kitchen.

1102
00:56:50,217 --> 00:56:51,755
- Come on.
- He's gonna serve you

1103
00:56:51,790 --> 00:56:52,954
to people, with oranges.

1104
00:56:52,989 --> 00:56:54,560
Hey, hey. What's happening?

1105
00:56:54,595 --> 00:56:57,090
Dad, it's the chef. He's back.

1106
00:57:01,998 --> 00:57:04,295
Earl and Mae are giving
those ducks to the chef

1107
00:57:04,330 --> 00:57:05,637
so he can cook them.

1108
00:57:05,672 --> 00:57:07,001
I beg your pardon?

1109
00:57:07,036 --> 00:57:09,707
Dax, go back to Mom.
I'll handle this.

1110
00:57:09,742 --> 00:57:11,643
No! I can help! I can just...

1111
00:57:11,678 --> 00:57:13,007
Go back to Mom now!

1112
00:57:13,042 --> 00:57:14,745
Googoo, do not
get on that truck.

1113
00:57:14,780 --> 00:57:16,175
Look, I understand this is all

1114
00:57:16,210 --> 00:57:18,177
new to you... bit
weird, bit strange...

1115
00:57:18,212 --> 00:57:19,981
Don't you get it? It's a trap!

1116
00:57:20,016 --> 00:57:21,686
We've got to get your
ducks out of here!

1117
00:57:21,721 --> 00:57:23,633
Everyone, get off the truck
unless you want to be cooked!

1118
00:57:23,657 --> 00:57:24,854
- Cooked?

1119
00:57:24,889 --> 00:57:25,756
- What?
- Wait, what's that?

1120
00:57:25,791 --> 00:57:27,318
Come on! Hurry!

1121
00:57:27,353 --> 00:57:29,595
You got to go before
he comes back.

1122
00:57:38,067 --> 00:57:39,165
Let go!

1123
00:57:39,200 --> 00:57:41,134
- Earl and Mae are our leaders.
- Dax?

1124
00:57:41,169 --> 00:57:43,433
- They massage us.
- Dax!

1125
00:58:00,221 --> 00:58:02,661
Everyone, run! Now!

1126
00:58:09,098 --> 00:58:11,604
- Pam, the chef!
- What?

1127
00:58:11,639 --> 00:58:13,430
We have to get out of here now!

1128
00:58:13,465 --> 00:58:15,003
Go, go, go!

1129
00:58:16,435 --> 00:58:18,171
Okay, let's go.

1130
00:58:18,206 --> 00:58:20,272
Let's go, let's go, let's
go! Go, go, go, go, go!

1131
00:58:20,307 --> 00:58:22,175
Everyone, take off!

1132
00:58:24,146 --> 00:58:26,278
Dax, on my back!

1133
00:58:28,315 --> 00:58:30,513
Hurry!

1134
00:58:53,472 --> 00:58:55,747
Guys, we need to rest.

1135
00:58:55,782 --> 00:58:57,375
Follow me.

1136
00:59:08,256 --> 00:59:10,322
Guys, are you okay?
What happened?

1137
00:59:10,357 --> 00:59:12,500
- Mom, he was coming for the...
- I'll tell you what happened.

1138
00:59:12,524 --> 00:59:15,624
I told him to stay back, and
he almost got himself killed.

1139
00:59:15,659 --> 00:59:17,967
But, Dad, I was trying to help.

1140
00:59:18,002 --> 00:59:19,705
I don't need your help, Dax.

1141
00:59:19,740 --> 00:59:21,498
I need you to do what I say!

1142
00:59:21,533 --> 00:59:23,907
Do you understand?!

1143
00:59:31,576 --> 00:59:33,015
Listen, Dax.

1144
00:59:33,050 --> 00:59:35,754
Just let us grown-ups
figure it out while...

1145
00:59:40,992 --> 00:59:43,157
All right, everyone,
let's call it a night.

1146
00:59:43,995 --> 00:59:46,226
We could use the rest.

1147
01:00:57,497 --> 01:00:59,695
Gwen, you scared me.

1148
01:00:59,730 --> 01:01:01,598
You look mad.

1149
01:01:01,633 --> 01:01:03,809
You need a hug!

1150
01:01:04,702 --> 01:01:06,779
No, Gwen, I don't need a hug.

1151
01:01:06,814 --> 01:01:08,440
- Whoa! I said no hug.

1152
01:01:08,475 --> 01:01:11,080
Don't fight it. It'll
make you feel better.

1153
01:01:14,888 --> 01:01:16,217
Can you let go now?

1154
01:01:16,252 --> 01:01:18,054
- You feel better?
- No.

1155
01:01:18,089 --> 01:01:20,452
Then it hasn't kicked in yet.

1156
01:01:24,161 --> 01:01:25,897
- What about now?
- No.

1157
01:01:25,932 --> 01:01:27,492
- Now?
- Mm-mm.

1158
01:01:27,527 --> 01:01:28,757
- Now?
- Nothing.

1159
01:01:28,792 --> 01:01:30,198
- A little?
- Nope.

1160
01:01:30,233 --> 01:01:31,727
I felt something.

1161
01:01:31,762 --> 01:01:33,267
Mm-mm.

1162
01:01:52,123 --> 01:01:54,255
- Oh, no, he's back!

1163
01:01:54,290 --> 01:01:56,257
- Every duck for himself!

1164
01:01:56,292 --> 01:01:57,830
- Kids!
- Dax! Gwen!

1165
01:02:04,828 --> 01:02:06,564
- Mom! Dad! No, no, no!

1166
01:02:06,599 --> 01:02:09,402
- No, no! Dax, Gwen, stay back!
- No! Stop!

1167
01:02:10,207 --> 01:02:11,734
- Get out of here now!
- Go hide!

1168
01:02:11,769 --> 01:02:13,406
- Hide, kids! Go! Go, go!

1169
01:02:28,324 --> 01:02:31,094
No.

1170
01:02:33,329 --> 01:02:34,823
No, no, no. Mom!

1171
01:02:34,858 --> 01:02:37,001
- Mom, Dad, no!
- Daddy!

1172
01:02:37,036 --> 01:02:39,795
- Oh, kids! Oh, kids!
- No!

1173
01:02:39,830 --> 01:02:42,505
- No!

1174
01:03:43,729 --> 01:03:46,466
He's gonna cook Mom
and Dad, isn't he?

1175
01:03:46,501 --> 01:03:48,897
And he's gonna come back for us.

1176
01:03:48,932 --> 01:03:51,603
- And he'll cook us, too!

1177
01:03:51,638 --> 01:03:56,047
I wish we tasted awful!

1178
01:03:56,082 --> 01:03:58,313
Gwen, we're not giving up, okay?

1179
01:03:58,348 --> 01:04:00,579
We're-we're gonna
figure something out.

1180
01:04:01,648 --> 01:04:02,955
We are?

1181
01:04:02,990 --> 01:04:04,814
Yes. There has to be a way.

1182
01:04:04,849 --> 01:04:06,651
But-but how?

1183
01:04:06,686 --> 01:04:08,554
You can't even fly.

1184
01:04:08,589 --> 01:04:10,061
Oh, we're doomed.

1185
01:04:24,110 --> 01:04:27,045
Gwen, you're a genius.

1186
01:04:28,015 --> 01:04:29,740
Am I?

1187
01:04:35,121 --> 01:04:38,551
We are not getting cooked today.

1188
01:04:42,029 --> 01:04:43,490
Come on, Pam, keep going.

1189
01:04:47,793 --> 01:04:48,924
Pam?

1190
01:04:48,959 --> 01:04:50,464
It's hopeless, Mack.

1191
01:04:50,499 --> 01:04:53,170
What? No, no, no, no,
no, it's not hopeless.

1192
01:04:53,205 --> 01:04:55,535
- We can do this.
- No, we've lost them.

1193
01:04:55,570 --> 01:04:58,010
Mack, we've lost the
kids. You were right.

1194
01:04:58,045 --> 01:05:00,243
We never ever should
have left the pond.

1195
01:05:00,278 --> 01:05:01,673
Pam, enough.

1196
01:05:01,708 --> 01:05:03,312
This isn't you.

1197
01:05:03,347 --> 01:05:06,183
You're the adventurous
one, the-the-the brave one.

1198
01:05:06,218 --> 01:05:08,185
You never give up on anything.

1199
01:05:08,220 --> 01:05:11,716
You-you haven't
even given up on me.

1200
01:05:11,751 --> 01:05:13,355
Come on, Pam.

1201
01:05:13,390 --> 01:05:15,027
You've proven over
and over again

1202
01:05:15,062 --> 01:05:17,887
that when everything is
hopeless, we have to be...

1203
01:05:17,922 --> 01:05:19,658
Optimistic.

1204
01:05:19,693 --> 01:05:23,398
Yes. And now you and me are
going to get our kids back

1205
01:05:23,433 --> 01:05:27,303
so we can finish this
crazy, wonderful adventure.

1206
01:05:27,338 --> 01:05:29,998
And we are going to show them
that when danger strikes,

1207
01:05:30,033 --> 01:05:31,934
you do not run from it.

1208
01:05:31,969 --> 01:05:34,475
You take a stand.

1209
01:05:35,511 --> 01:05:37,346
That's it! Look, Pa...

1210
01:05:37,381 --> 01:05:39,678
- Shh! Shh, shh.

1211
01:05:41,649 --> 01:05:42,912
We can do this.

1212
01:05:42,947 --> 01:05:45,288
Mack, Mack, we can do this.

1213
01:05:45,323 --> 01:05:47,059
Come on. Let's go.

1214
01:05:47,094 --> 01:05:48,588
Okay.

1215
01:05:49,954 --> 01:05:51,492
- Left, Pam.

1216
01:05:51,527 --> 01:05:53,142
- Just... You do your left.
- No, no, no, no. Right.

1217
01:05:53,166 --> 01:05:54,803
Okay, you're moving on
the left. Move on the top.

1218
01:05:54,827 --> 01:05:57,168
- Just set...
- Okay, no, no, no, no, no.

1219
01:05:58,831 --> 01:06:01,073
- Psst. Hey. Over here. Here.
- Hey. Hey.

1220
01:06:01,108 --> 01:06:02,305
- Here.
- Do it together.

1221
01:06:02,340 --> 01:06:03,779
- Ya mon. Together.
- Do it together.

1222
01:06:03,803 --> 01:06:06,001
Wh-Wh-What?

1223
01:06:07,378 --> 01:06:10,313
Together.

1224
01:07:00,596 --> 01:07:01,430
Hmm?

1225
01:07:01,465 --> 01:07:04,631
You trap me for years,

1226
01:07:04,666 --> 01:07:08,063
now you're trying
to cook my friends?

1227
01:07:08,098 --> 01:07:09,405
Enough!

1228
01:07:09,440 --> 01:07:13,904
It is payback time!

1229
01:07:13,939 --> 01:07:15,873
Payback!

1230
01:07:24,983 --> 01:07:26,290
Reload.

1231
01:07:26,325 --> 01:07:28,259
Ah...

1232
01:07:34,333 --> 01:07:36,630
Eat this.

1233
01:08:38,089 --> 01:08:40,023
- What?

1234
01:08:40,058 --> 01:08:45,028
We're coming!

1235
01:08:52,169 --> 01:08:53,509
Dax!

1236
01:08:53,544 --> 01:08:56,281
- We got this, guys.

1237
01:09:04,951 --> 01:09:08,359
We can do this!

1238
01:09:11,826 --> 01:09:13,430
Mom!

1239
01:09:13,465 --> 01:09:16,268
Kids! Oh, kids.

1240
01:09:33,012 --> 01:09:35,177
Woo-hoo!

1241
01:09:37,885 --> 01:09:40,248
Ya mon!

1242
01:09:47,433 --> 01:09:49,059
Everyone!

1243
01:09:49,094 --> 01:09:50,401
Delroy, you made it!

1244
01:09:50,436 --> 01:09:52,997
- You're alive!

1245
01:09:54,033 --> 01:09:56,308
I'm so happy to see you.

1246
01:09:56,343 --> 01:10:00,576
And you, all dressed
up for Jamaica.

1247
01:10:00,611 --> 01:10:02,006
- Look at you!

1248
01:10:02,041 --> 01:10:05,746
Well, come on. Let's
go, go, go, go, go!

1249
01:10:37,879 --> 01:10:40,044
We're almost there, everyone.

1250
01:10:40,079 --> 01:10:42,079
I can feel it!

1251
01:10:45,722 --> 01:10:49,394
Okay, so we're a bit lost.

1252
01:10:49,429 --> 01:10:51,462
Must have missed
a turn somewhere.

1253
01:10:51,497 --> 01:10:53,255
But don't worry.

1254
01:10:53,290 --> 01:10:56,665
We just have to go back
to the big green statue.

1255
01:11:05,676 --> 01:11:08,105
- Pam?
- Hmm?

1256
01:11:16,885 --> 01:11:19,281
Mack, the water.

1257
01:11:19,316 --> 01:11:21,525
It's glowing.

1258
01:11:21,560 --> 01:11:23,186
It's glowing.

1259
01:11:23,221 --> 01:11:24,528
It's real.

1260
01:11:24,563 --> 01:11:27,498
The water is glowing!

1261
01:11:30,393 --> 01:11:32,470
Dad. Dad!

1262
01:11:32,505 --> 01:11:34,472
Come look.

1263
01:11:44,077 --> 01:11:45,241
That's it.

1264
01:11:45,276 --> 01:11:46,847
That's Jamaica.

1265
01:11:59,290 --> 01:12:01,092
Well, what are you waiting for?

1266
01:12:01,127 --> 01:12:03,325
Lead the way.

1267
01:12:05,670 --> 01:12:08,066
- Gwen, final check, please.

1268
01:12:08,101 --> 01:12:09,507
Aye, Captain.

1269
01:12:09,542 --> 01:12:11,069
Tail feather torsion?

1270
01:12:11,104 --> 01:12:12,367
Check.

1271
01:12:12,402 --> 01:12:13,643
Wing deployment?

1272
01:12:13,678 --> 01:12:14,743
Check.

1273
01:12:14,778 --> 01:12:16,547
Heads in Bake-Off mode?

1274
01:12:16,582 --> 01:12:18,582
- Takeoff mode.
- Takeoff mode?

1275
01:12:18,617 --> 01:12:19,979
Check!

1276
01:12:20,014 --> 01:12:22,410
Let's fly.

1277
01:12:34,424 --> 01:12:36,325
Woo-hoo-hoo! Yeah!

1278
01:12:36,360 --> 01:12:38,426
Let's go! Come on!

1279
01:12:38,461 --> 01:12:40,329
Woo-hoo! Yeah!

1280
01:12:40,364 --> 01:12:42,672
Woo-hoo!

1281
01:12:43,510 --> 01:12:45,202
Whoa! Whoo!

1282
01:12:46,579 --> 01:12:49,437
- Whoo!
- Woo-hoo! Yeah!

1283
01:12:49,472 --> 01:12:51,406
Look at me!

1284
01:12:51,441 --> 01:12:54,585
Whoa!

1285
01:12:54,620 --> 01:12:56,950
Yeah!

1286
01:12:56,985 --> 01:13:00,118
- Woo-hoo!

1287
01:13:04,454 --> 01:13:07,862
I am back!

1288
01:13:07,897 --> 01:13:10,535
Woo-hoo-hoo!

1289
01:13:10,570 --> 01:13:12,229
Hey, Devon!

1290
01:13:12,264 --> 01:13:13,901
- Deedee!

1291
01:13:15,432 --> 01:13:17,542
- Winston!

1292
01:13:21,680 --> 01:13:23,878
Whoo!

1293
01:13:29,182 --> 01:13:31,952
- Whoa.
- Whoa.

1294
01:13:33,516 --> 01:13:35,252
Wow.

1295
01:13:36,123 --> 01:13:39,256
- Whoa! Woo-hoo-hoo! Yeah!

1296
01:13:53,910 --> 01:13:56,075
Wow.

1297
01:13:56,110 --> 01:13:57,274
Hey!

1298
01:13:57,309 --> 01:14:00,585
Hey, you changed your mind.

1299
01:14:00,620 --> 01:14:02,884
Better late than never, right?

1300
01:14:02,919 --> 01:14:04,886
Kim!

1301
01:14:05,691 --> 01:14:07,152
Dax!

1302
01:14:07,187 --> 01:14:08,626
Dax, you're here.

1303
01:14:08,661 --> 01:14:11,387
Wow. Your wings,
they're beautiful.

1304
01:14:11,422 --> 01:14:13,026
Thanks.

1305
01:14:13,061 --> 01:14:14,962
Dax kept saying your name
while he was sleeping.

1306
01:14:16,559 --> 01:14:18,603
Woo-hoo-hoo-hoo!

1307
01:14:19,837 --> 01:14:23,036
- Whoa! Delroy!

1308
01:14:23,071 --> 01:14:26,006
- I'm home!
- Delroy! Delroy!

1309
01:14:34,280 --> 01:14:35,785
What?

1310
01:14:35,820 --> 01:14:37,446

1311
01:14:37,481 --> 01:14:39,217

1312
01:14:40,187 --> 01:14:42,220

No, Gwenny, you cannot
take Toothpick back home.

1340
01:16:02,170 --> 01:16:04,599
But Toothpick wants to come.

1341
01:16:04,634 --> 01:16:07,239
No, no, no. No, no, no, no.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

Mm, I think it's
time to let him go.

01:16:10,849 --> 01:16:12,310
Okay, honey?

1344
01:16:12,345 --> 01:16:13,443
Okay.

1345
01:16:15,051 --> 01:16:17,854
So, we're ready for takeoff?

1346
01:16:17,889 --> 01:16:19,955
Wait. Where's your father?

1347
01:16:19,990 --> 01:16:21,616
Guys! Guys!

1348
01:16:21,651 --> 01:16:24,157
Guys!

1349
01:16:24,192 --> 01:16:26,225
I just met these birds
who are totally lost.

1350
01:16:26,260 --> 01:16:27,930
I said we'd help 'em get home.

1351
01:16:27,965 --> 01:16:29,701
What do you say?

1352
01:16:29,736 --> 01:16:31,659
Hello.

1353
01:16:31,694 --> 01:16:33,705
- Hi. Hello. Hi.

1354
01:16:33,740 --> 01:16:35,498
Mack, you do know

1355
01:16:35,533 --> 01:16:37,566
that penguins are
from the South Pole?

1356
01:16:37,601 --> 01:16:39,073
I know! Isn't that great?

1357
01:16:39,108 --> 01:16:40,272
GWEN and DAX: Yeah!

1358
01:16:40,307 --> 01:16:41,977
We're going to the South Pole!

1359
01:16:42,012 --> 01:16:44,606
No, I'm not going. No way.

1360
01:16:44,641 --> 01:16:46,883
Oh, please, Uncle Dan.

1361
01:16:46,918 --> 01:16:48,643
Please...

1362
01:16:48,678 --> 01:16:51,690
ALL Please...

1363
01:16:53,716 --> 01:16:55,122
Okay, okay.

1364
01:16:55,157 --> 01:16:57,454
We're going to the South Pole.

1365
01:16:57,489 --> 01:16:59,027
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

1366
01:16:59,062 --> 01:17:01,799
Come on, Pam. We're
going to the South Pole.

1367
01:17:01,834 --> 01:17:04,329
I've created a monster.

1368
01:17:04,364 --> 01:17:06,166
Okay, so let's talk itinerary.

1369
01:17:06,201 --> 01:17:09,103
I say Costa Rica,
Panama, Amazon River.

1370
01:17:09,138 --> 01:17:10,808
- Any other ideas? Oh, oh!

1371
01:17:10,843 --> 01:17:12,568
I want to see Titicaca!

1372
01:17:12,603 --> 01:17:14,570
Titicaca! Great.
