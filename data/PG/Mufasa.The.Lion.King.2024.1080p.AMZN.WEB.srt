took your father

I'm not a kibeti.
I'm a Mufasa.

365
00:19:48,789 --> 00:19:50,826
Do you even know
what "Mufasa" means?

366
00:19:50,859 --> 00:19:52,693
-Mufasa No.
-It means, "king."

you have a challenge.

Mufasa There's
a herd of antelope

532
00:28:11,226 --> 00:28:13,628
heading across
the dry lakebed.

533
00:28:13,661 --> 00:28:16,564
About half a day from here?

534
00:28:16,598 --> 00:28:18,633
Eshe And how do you know
they're not gazelles?

535
00:28:19,767 --> 00:28:22,170
Mufasa Their steps
are too heavy.

536
00:28:22,203 --> 00:28:24,772
-Moving way too slow.
-Eshe What else?

537
00:28:24,807 --> 00:28:27,208
Come on. You can do it.

538
00:28:27,242 --> 00:28:33,114
Mufasa sighs When the wind
hits their horns, it moves up

539
00:28:33,147 --> 00:28:37,151
instead of across.
So, definitely antelope horns.

540
00:28:37,185 --> 00:28:38,553
Eshe Very good.

What's wrong?

543
00:28:47,262 --> 00:28:49,230
Sometimes I get a scent.

544
00:28:49,264 --> 00:28:51,666
It's barely a trace
on the wind.

545
00:28:51,699 --> 00:28:53,368
And it smells like home.

546
00:28:57,840 --> 00:28:59,207
Then it's gone.

547
00:28:59,240 --> 00:29:02,110
Mufasa, your parents
are still out there.

548
00:29:02,143 --> 00:29:03,278
We can keep looking.

549
00:29:03,311 --> 00:29:04,579
I lost them, Eshe.

550
00:29:04,612 --> 00:29:06,815
You're wasting your time
training me like this.

551
00:29:06,849 --> 00:29:09,852
But these skills you have,
no other male has them.

552
00:29:09,885 --> 00:29:12,353
Obasi will never accept me.

553
00:29:12,387 --> 00:29:15,089
I'll never be his blood.
His family.

554
00:29:15,123 --> 00:29:16,391

555
00:29:16,424 --> 00:29:19,594
And if Obasi could see
how gifted you are...

556
00:29:19,627 --> 00:29:22,630

a stray, you know. chuckles

What do you mean, Mufasa?

560
00:29:28,603 --> 00:29:30,605
I never have to be like Taka.

561
00:29:31,506 --> 00:29:33,308

An outcast, afraid of water,
never takes a bath.

565
00:29:51,326 --> 00:29:52,727
Which means he smells like me.

566

-Do we have a deal?
-No.

1067
00:54:29,637 --> 00:54:30,872
What? Why?

1068
00:54:30,906 --> 00:54:34,009
Rafiki will let you live.

1069
00:54:34,042 --> 00:54:36,244
I've had enough of this!

1070
00:54:36,278 --> 00:54:38,113
Taka, do not eat him.

1071
00:54:38,146 --> 00:54:39,848
Wonderful.
Another misfit stray

1072
00:54:39,881 --> 00:54:41,216
we're not supposed to eat.

1073
00:54:41,249 --> 00:54:44,019
So, you expect us
to follow this baboon

1074
00:54:44,052 --> 00:54:47,089
to a place nobody
has ever seen? scoffs

1075
00:54:47,122 --> 00:54:49,825
-I'll be better off alone.
-Hhe ntombazane.

1076
00:54:49,858 --> 00:54:52,294
A single stick may smoke,

1077
00:54:52,327 --> 00:54:54,229
but it will never burn.

1078
00:54:57,399 --> 00:54:59,067
Okay, now that
there's five of us,

1079
00:54:59,101 --> 00:55:00,135
why don't we all go around

1080
00:55:00,168 --> 00:55:01,870
and say a fun fact
about ourselves?

1081
00:55:01,903 --> 00:55:02,871
I'll go first.

1082
00:55:02,904 --> 00:55:06,108
chuckling I once had
a crush on a flamingo.

1083
00:55:06,141 --> 00:55:08,776
whispers I've never
said that out loud.

1084
00:55:08,810 --> 00:55:09,945
And they're walking away.

1085
00:55:09,978 --> 00:55:11,913
Yeah, places to go,
kingdoms to see.

1086
00:55:11,947 --> 00:55:13,381
We're busy. Let's hustle.

1087
00:55:13,415 --> 00:55:15,616
♪ exhilarating song playing
in other language

1088
00:55:23,391 --> 00:55:26,061
Wait, wait, wait. Now you're
the star of this thing?

1089
00:55:26,094 --> 00:55:28,864
Someone's a little tired
of bein' second banana, huh?

1090
00:55:28,897 --> 00:55:31,233
All of a sudden, there's
a lotta Rafiki in this story.

1091
00:55:31,266 --> 00:55:33,201
You even gave yourself
a long-lost brother.

1092
00:55:33,235 --> 00:55:34,269
-Yeah.
-Timon What's next?

1093
00:55:34,302 --> 00:55:35,570
A funny catchphrase?

1094
00:55:35,604 --> 00:55:37,372
Pumbaa
You gonna be fartin' next?
'Cause that's my thing.

1095
00:55:37,405 --> 00:55:40,008
You cannot tell the story
of Mufasa

1096
00:55:40,041 --> 00:55:42,710
without the story of Rafiki.

1097
00:55:42,743 --> 00:55:44,079
Timon Oh, now he's even
talkin' about himself

1098
00:55:44,112 --> 00:55:45,046
in the third person.

1099
00:55:45,080 --> 00:55:46,314
Pretty soon, he'll have
his own fragrance.

1100
00:55:46,348 --> 00:55:49,117
Pumbaa And I'm the only one
with a fragrance around here.

1101
00:55:49,151 --> 00:55:50,886
It's called
"Pumbaa by Pumbaa,"

1102
00:55:50,919 --> 00:55:53,321
and from what I hear,
it's pretty gross.

1103
00:55:54,022 --> 00:55:55,924
Mom? Dad?

1104
00:55:55,957 --> 00:55:58,260
If you can hear me, come home.

1105
00:55:59,227 --> 00:56:00,862
Please.

1106
00:56:00,896 --> 00:56:03,198
Come home.

1107
00:56:03,231 --> 00:56:05,666
-♪ melancholic music playing
-thunder rumbling

1108
00:56:09,905 --> 00:56:10,906
Mufasa whispering Mother?

1109
00:56:13,208 --> 00:56:14,209
Mother?

1110
00:56:18,246 --> 00:56:20,048
voice echoes Milele.

1111
00:56:20,081 --> 00:56:21,983
-Mother! gasps
-grunts

1112
00:56:22,017 --> 00:56:23,351
breathing heavily

1113
00:56:28,924 --> 00:56:29,991
grunts softly

1114
00:56:39,868 --> 00:56:41,469
-Rafiki.
-Rafiki Ayi suka.

1115
00:56:41,503 --> 00:56:43,338
-What are you doing?
-I am fishing.

1116
00:56:43,371 --> 00:56:46,041
Mufasa You're sitting on
a rock with your eyes closed.

1117
00:56:46,074 --> 00:56:49,377
My eyes are open.
It is my lids that are closed.

1118
00:56:49,411 --> 00:56:52,013
Why am I talking to a baboon?

1119
00:56:52,047 --> 00:56:55,951
I am not a baboon.
I am a mandrill.

1120
00:56:55,984 --> 00:56:58,853
No offense,
but a monkey is a monkey.

1121
00:56:58,887 --> 00:57:00,322
Rafiki And a stray
is a stray.

1122
00:57:00,355 --> 00:57:01,423
What's that supposed to mean?

1123
00:57:01,456 --> 00:57:03,858
It means
we are very much the same.

1124
00:57:03,892 --> 00:57:05,260
Siyafana.

1125
00:57:05,293 --> 00:57:07,162
We are nothing alike.

1126
00:57:07,195 --> 00:57:10,432
Take a good look. I am a lion.

1127
00:57:10,465 --> 00:57:12,267
Rafiki A lion
who fears water,

1128
00:57:12,300 --> 00:57:14,336
fears his own reflection.

1129
00:57:14,369 --> 00:57:16,171
Who can't sleep
because of what he sees

1130
00:57:16,204 --> 00:57:18,039
when he closes his eyes.

1131
00:57:18,073 --> 00:57:19,174
Huh?

1132
00:57:19,207 --> 00:57:22,210
You are afraid
of your dreams, Mufasa.

1133
00:57:22,244 --> 00:57:24,346
Afraid of what
you see in them.

1134
00:57:24,379 --> 00:57:26,915
Mufasa I see my parents.

1135
00:57:27,482 --> 00:57:29,818
I feel them everywhere.

1136
00:57:29,851 --> 00:57:31,486
Rafiki Of course
you do, Mufasa.

1137
00:57:32,320 --> 00:57:35,156
You will feel them forever.

1138
00:57:35,190 --> 00:57:38,460
My mother, I hear her voice.

1139
00:57:38,493 --> 00:57:42,397
She tells me that we are
on a journey to Milele,

1140
00:57:42,430 --> 00:57:45,867
but I feel so lost
without her.

1141
00:57:45,900 --> 00:57:49,371
Your journey
is not a dream, Mufasa.

1142
00:57:49,404 --> 00:57:51,439
Your mother is guiding you,

1143
00:57:51,473 --> 00:57:54,976
and where you are going,
a family awaits.

1144
00:57:55,543 --> 00:57:56,811
grunts

1145
00:57:57,846 --> 00:58:03,018
Ah... Ni heshima
kukutana nawe, binamu.

1146
00:58:03,051 --> 00:58:06,955
Nenda kwa amani.
Ah... laughs

1147
00:58:07,856 --> 00:58:08,990
Mufasa What are you doing?

1148
00:58:09,424 --> 00:58:10,492
We're starving.

1149
00:58:10,525 --> 00:58:12,227
'Twas not its time.

1150
00:58:12,260 --> 00:58:15,964
Instead, the fish has agreed
to let us share the water.

1151
00:58:17,465 --> 00:58:18,500
sighs

1152
00:58:19,467 --> 00:58:25,240
Iketle Rafiki.
Iketle mosimane.

1153
00:58:26,274 --> 00:58:27,375
I have a report.

1154
00:58:28,076 --> 00:58:29,177
It's morning.

1155
00:58:29,944 --> 00:58:31,446
End of report.

1156
00:58:32,514 --> 00:58:33,915
grunts

1157
00:58:39,254 --> 00:58:42,123
Rafiki The earth divided
is now a choice.

1158
00:58:42,157 --> 00:58:43,892
Around or down?

1159
00:58:43,925 --> 00:58:46,027
The decision is yours.

1160
00:58:48,930 --> 00:58:50,131
Mmm.

1161
00:58:50,165 --> 00:58:53,001
Look out there,
beyond the light.

1162
00:58:54,002 --> 00:58:56,471
Across the deepest canyon.

1163
00:58:57,972 --> 00:59:00,008
"Across the deepest canyon."

1164
00:59:00,575 --> 00:59:01,476
We should go down.

1165
00:59:01,509 --> 00:59:04,346
Why? Because of some
fairy tale? scoffs

1166
00:59:04,379 --> 00:59:05,980
The rocks
will hide our tracks.

1167
00:59:06,014 --> 00:59:07,482
It's safer to go around.

1168
00:59:07,515 --> 00:59:09,150
I picked up their scents.

1169
00:59:09,184 --> 00:59:11,886
The only thing you picked up
is a hallucinating baboon.

1170
00:59:11,920 --> 00:59:13,088
I am a mandrill.

1171
00:59:13,121 --> 00:59:14,522
This is a waste of time.

1172
00:59:14,556 --> 00:59:16,091
Close your eyes.

1173
00:59:16,524 --> 00:59:17,625
What?

1174
00:59:17,659 --> 00:59:20,528
Tell me what you see.
What you feel.

1175
00:59:20,562 --> 00:59:22,163
There's nothing on the wind.

1176
00:59:22,197 --> 00:59:23,331
Mufasa No, they're moving

1177
00:59:23,365 --> 00:59:24,666
-through the bush willow.
-They, who?

1178
00:59:24,699 --> 00:59:27,902
The females, out front.
Come on.

1179
00:59:27,936 --> 00:59:30,071
Clear your thoughts.
Concentrate.

1180
00:59:30,105 --> 00:59:32,140
I am concentrating.

1181
00:59:43,952 --> 00:59:45,086
He's right.

1182
00:59:46,654 --> 00:59:48,323
We have to go down.

1183
00:59:48,356 --> 00:59:50,225
Wow. Wow, wow, wow.

1184
00:59:50,258 --> 00:59:52,360
Ah! Uyabona mfana.

1185
00:59:52,394 --> 00:59:55,964
Now the many sticks
will make fire as one.

1186
00:59:55,997 --> 00:59:58,633
Come on. We have places to go.

1187
00:59:58,666 --> 01:00:01,169
Zazu And kingdoms to see.

1188
01:00:01,202 --> 01:00:03,171
Rafiki And kingdoms to see!

1189
01:00:03,204 --> 01:00:06,307
-laughs Masihambeni.
