1
00:01:39,279 --> 00:01:41,400
Hurry, hurry, step this way.

2
00:01:41,477 --> 00:01:42,454
Get your tickets now.

3
00:01:43,065 --> 00:01:46,207
Don't be shut out, friend.
Step this way.

4
00:01:46,444 --> 00:01:49,008
See the most
wondrous sights imaginable

5
00:01:49,089 --> 00:01:50,921
pulled from the four corners
of the Earth.

6
00:01:51,084 --> 00:01:54,993
Acts to delight,
to thrill and to mystify!

7
00:01:55,154 --> 00:01:57,145
Walk through these gates
and into a world of wonder!

8
00:01:57,475 --> 00:02:02,405
She is here, ladies and gents,
live and in person.

9
00:02:02,563 --> 00:02:07,326
That gun-slinging, sharp-shooting
honey-pie of the Wild West.

10
00:02:07,569 --> 00:02:10,989
He has traveled the world and
baffled the crown princes of Europe.

11
00:02:11,152 --> 00:02:13,533
- He will amaze! He will astound!

12
00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:17,505
The Great and Powerful Oz!

13
00:02:17,793 --> 00:02:20,641
I always knew that I was
destined for show business.

14
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:24,651
And now look at me.
A magician's assistant.

15
00:02:25,061 --> 00:02:27,283
To think,
an hour ago I was just

16
00:02:27,358 --> 00:02:29,113
selling oil cakes
on the midway.

17
00:02:29,279 --> 00:02:30,749
Yes, well, opportunity comes

18
00:02:30,824 --> 00:02:32,579
when you least expect it,
my dear.

19
00:02:35,251 --> 00:02:38,807
Wow! What a get-up.

20
00:02:39,513 --> 00:02:40,857
- You won't need this.
- Oh.

21
00:02:40,933 --> 00:02:44,693
You are playing
the simple country girl.

22
00:02:48,409 --> 00:02:49,458
Oh!

23
00:02:51,375 --> 00:02:54,975
A gift in honor of your debut.

24
00:02:55,050 --> 00:02:56,052
Oh!

25
00:02:56,345 --> 00:02:59,193
Now, this belonged to
my grandmother.

26
00:02:59,352 --> 00:03:03,829
A tsarina from Mirkutsk,
and a decorated war hero.

27
00:03:03,947 --> 00:03:04,995
Your grandmother?

28
00:03:05,074 --> 00:03:08,424
Yes. She was killed in battle,
the poor thing.

29
00:03:08,583 --> 00:03:09,677
Which battle?

30
00:03:09,836 --> 00:03:11,465
- Which battle?
- Uh-huh.

31
00:03:11,632 --> 00:03:13,386
Well, there are so many.

32
00:03:13,553 --> 00:03:16,401
You've heard
of the Battle of Kreplach?

33
00:03:16,477 --> 00:03:17,480
No.

34
00:03:17,563 --> 00:03:19,739
No? Good.
That's where she died.

35
00:03:19,902 --> 00:03:24,255
And this music box
was the only thing to survive.

36
00:03:29,592 --> 00:03:33,774
But I know that Grammie
would want you to have it.

37
00:03:34,688 --> 00:03:35,729
- Professor.

38
00:03:35,774 --> 00:03:37,779
Frank!
The sock is on the door.

39
00:03:37,862 --> 00:03:39,036
We're rehearsing.

40
00:03:39,282 --> 00:03:41,128
How many times do
I have to tell you to knock?

41
00:03:41,538 --> 00:03:42,792
Knock.

42
00:03:56,700 --> 00:03:57,667
I knocked.

43
00:03:57,742 --> 00:03:59,210
- What is it?
- Showtime.

44
00:03:59,369 --> 00:04:00,529
Why didn't you say something?

45
00:04:00,537 --> 00:04:03,256
Only a half a house.
Here's the take.

46
00:04:07,669 --> 00:04:09,296
Pitiful.

47
00:04:14,885 --> 00:04:16,808
All right, this is your cut.

48
00:04:18,805 --> 00:04:22,651
For you, the applause
will be approbation enough.

49
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:30,113
Well, how do you think I feel?

50
00:04:31,151 --> 00:04:32,573
A man of my talents,

51
00:04:32,652 --> 00:04:34,495
I should be playing
the Orpheum Circuit!

52
00:04:34,654 --> 00:04:36,531
Instead of some dusty podunk

53
00:04:36,698 --> 00:04:40,418
in a second-hand jacket
falling apart at the seams.

54
00:04:40,576 --> 00:04:41,828
You're gonna have to patch
this thing again.

55
00:04:41,994 --> 00:04:43,246
- Again?
- Yeah.

56
00:04:43,829 --> 00:04:45,627
- Let's go. Hat!

57
00:04:45,789 --> 00:04:47,507
- Hat.
- Hat. Okay.

58
00:04:48,792 --> 00:04:51,170
- You're the new girl, huh?
- Yes.

59
00:04:51,253 --> 00:04:54,132
Good, we needed a new one.
The last one left us.

60
00:04:54,715 --> 00:04:57,138
Poor thing.
Suffered from a broken heart.

61
00:04:57,301 --> 00:04:59,349
Attack. Heart attack.

62
00:05:00,304 --> 00:05:02,773
But she's resting comfortably
now in Abilene

63
00:05:02,932 --> 00:05:04,684
expected to
make a full recovery.

64
00:05:04,850 --> 00:05:06,898
Perhaps you'd like to join her.

65
00:05:08,354 --> 00:05:10,823
Now, remember,
when I ask for a volunteer...

66
00:05:10,981 --> 00:05:12,608
I raise my hand.

67
00:05:13,025 --> 00:05:15,653
You are overqualified
for this job, my dear.

68
00:05:15,986 --> 00:05:17,988
Let's go make some magic.

69
00:05:18,155 --> 00:05:19,498
Ladies and gentlemen,

70
00:05:19,615 --> 00:05:20,992
the show has already begun.

71
00:05:21,492 --> 00:05:23,039
There are still
a few seats left.

72
00:05:23,202 --> 00:05:26,251
Don't miss your chance to see
Oz, the Great and Powerful!

73
00:05:26,372 --> 00:05:28,966
Journey with me now,
across those deserts

74
00:05:29,124 --> 00:05:33,550
to the mystical lands
of the Arabian Peninsula.

75
00:05:38,092 --> 00:05:42,268
For 5,000 years,

76
00:05:42,429 --> 00:05:46,935
her lonely spirit
has been trapped.

77
00:05:47,810 --> 00:05:51,940
But tonight,
we will attempt to free her.

78
00:05:53,107 --> 00:05:56,532
I shall require a volunteer
from the audience.

79
00:05:58,362 --> 00:05:59,534
Anyone.

80
00:06:02,116 --> 00:06:03,958
Anyone.

81
00:06:12,625 --> 00:06:13,877
How about you, madam?

82
00:06:14,210 --> 00:06:16,463
Oh! Yes, I would
like to volunteer.

83
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:20,850
How kind of you. Please.

84
00:06:21,009 --> 00:06:23,888
Just remember what I told you.

85
00:06:24,053 --> 00:06:27,648
A simple country girl,
ladies and gentlemen.

86
00:06:29,892 --> 00:06:34,489
Now, you have nothing to fear,
just so long as you believe.

87
00:06:34,647 --> 00:06:37,070
For when you do believe

88
00:06:37,233 --> 00:06:39,827
anything is possible.

89
00:06:44,365 --> 00:06:48,165
You are growing sleepy.

90
00:06:49,037 --> 00:06:53,759
Your eyelids become heavy.

91
00:06:55,418 --> 00:06:56,761
Sleep!

92
00:07:02,216 --> 00:07:04,139
Come, Fernanda!

93
00:07:06,929 --> 00:07:12,652
Allow yourself to merge
with this woman before me.

94
00:07:18,399 --> 00:07:23,451
Can you hear me,
oh, Queen Fernanda?

95
00:07:24,238 --> 00:07:25,615
Yes.

96
00:07:27,741 --> 00:07:29,709
Then rise.

97
00:07:32,746 --> 00:07:35,465
Rise!

98
00:07:37,209 --> 00:07:40,759
I command you to rise!

99
00:08:00,023 --> 00:08:03,948
Rise from your tomb of sand.

100
00:08:05,654 --> 00:08:07,656
Rise as your spirit...

101
00:08:07,823 --> 00:08:09,291
I see a wire!

102
00:08:13,870 --> 00:08:15,793
You are mistaken, sir.

103
00:08:15,956 --> 00:08:17,879
I am not!

104
00:08:18,041 --> 00:08:19,588
There is a wire!

105
00:08:19,668 --> 00:08:22,012
There is a wire holding her up!

106
00:08:22,170 --> 00:08:23,342
A wire?

107
00:08:23,505 --> 00:08:25,724
I see it, too.
It's right there.

108
00:08:27,050 --> 00:08:29,052
Clear as day.
Can't you see 'em?

109
00:08:31,304 --> 00:08:32,806
He's fooling us.

110
00:08:33,515 --> 00:08:35,358
A wire!

111
00:08:38,895 --> 00:08:41,899
What need have I of wires?
Frank.

112
00:09:03,002 --> 00:09:04,424
Make me walk!

113
00:09:05,546 --> 00:09:07,173
What's that?

114
00:09:08,716 --> 00:09:10,764
Make me walk.

115
00:09:12,595 --> 00:09:14,563
Not now, kid. Let us leave the wonders...

116
00:09:14,722 --> 00:09:17,896
But I believe in you.

117
00:09:21,061 --> 00:09:24,907
Look, it's not much,
but it's all that we have.

118
00:09:25,566 --> 00:09:27,694
Whatever you could do.

119
00:09:30,946 --> 00:09:34,541
I would make you walk,
it's just...

120
00:09:35,493 --> 00:09:36,494
It's just that...

121
00:09:36,577 --> 00:09:38,454
Well, go on, then.
Make the girl walk.

122
00:09:38,621 --> 00:09:39,964
Make the kid walk.

123
00:09:40,122 --> 00:09:41,874
Come on, you big phony.

124
00:09:42,583 --> 00:09:43,584
Yeah, come on!

125
00:09:43,709 --> 00:09:46,804
I would make her walk,
of course,

126
00:09:46,962 --> 00:09:49,932
but unfortunately there
is a distemper in the ether tonight.

127
00:09:50,090 --> 00:09:52,263
Make the kid walk,
you big phony.

128
00:09:52,426 --> 00:09:53,598
You see?

129
00:09:54,762 --> 00:09:55,934
I'm sorry, but...

130
00:09:57,306 --> 00:09:58,899
Thank you. Thank you.

131
00:09:59,558 --> 00:10:01,606
Oz, the Great and Powerful.

132
00:10:04,813 --> 00:10:06,907
Why didn't you close
the damn curtain sooner?

133
00:10:07,066 --> 00:10:08,409
I was dying out there.

134
00:10:08,567 --> 00:10:10,569
There was nothing
you could have done.

135
00:10:10,653 --> 00:10:12,133
I didn't really think
it was that bad.

136
00:10:12,279 --> 00:10:15,248
Of course not.
You're just a trained monkey.

137
00:10:20,161 --> 00:10:23,290
You know, you shouldn't
be so mean to me all the time, Professor.

138
00:10:23,456 --> 00:10:25,299
After all,
I'm the only friend you've got.

139
00:10:25,458 --> 00:10:26,960
Friend?

140
00:10:27,126 --> 00:10:31,006
You're not my friend, Frank.
I don't need a friend.

141
00:10:32,590 --> 00:10:36,891
What I need is someone who knows
when to close the damn curtain.

142
00:10:40,473 --> 00:10:41,690
It's a woman.

143
00:10:41,808 --> 00:10:44,357
Ah! Finally some good news.

144
00:10:44,519 --> 00:10:47,648
You want me to
wind up a music box?

145
00:10:48,690 --> 00:10:50,317
No.

146
00:10:52,193 --> 00:10:53,695
Not for this one, Frank.

147
00:10:56,656 --> 00:10:57,873
Hey, Annie.

148
00:10:59,867 --> 00:11:01,494
Hello, Oscar.

149
00:11:02,745 --> 00:11:03,871
Hmm.

150
00:11:07,333 --> 00:11:09,006
You look lovely.

151
00:11:10,003 --> 00:11:11,004
Thank you.

152
00:11:11,170 --> 00:11:14,265
What is this? Gingham?

153
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:16,513
You know it is.

154
00:11:17,719 --> 00:11:19,687
It was a wonderful show.

155
00:11:19,846 --> 00:11:22,474
Oh, don't tell me
you watched that debacle.

156
00:11:23,182 --> 00:11:26,356
I don't know why you didn't
just tell that poor girl the truth.

157
00:11:26,519 --> 00:11:30,319
What truth? That I'm a fake?
They would have had my head.

158
00:11:30,481 --> 00:11:33,530
And worse, they would have
demanded a refund.

159
00:11:33,693 --> 00:11:35,320
Come on, have a seat.

160
00:11:37,697 --> 00:11:39,323
I'll get you some tea.

161
00:11:41,533 --> 00:11:42,705
- Ooh!

162
00:11:44,411 --> 00:11:47,756
It's been a long time.
I haven't seen you since...

163
00:11:47,914 --> 00:11:49,666
The last time you
rolled into town.

164
00:11:51,209 --> 00:11:54,008
It's not often enough, Oscar, seeing you
once every few months.

165
00:11:54,171 --> 00:11:57,550
Well, it is a traveling circus.

166
00:11:58,675 --> 00:12:01,554
How's everything on the farm?
How's your ma?

167
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:02,972
She didn't send me
a pie this time.

168
00:12:03,055 --> 00:12:04,227
I hope she's not mad.

169
00:12:04,389 --> 00:12:05,390
I meant to write.

170
00:12:05,557 --> 00:12:07,685
I need to tell you
something, Oscar.

171
00:12:07,851 --> 00:12:10,229
That's never a good start
to a conversation.

172
00:12:10,395 --> 00:12:13,239
John Gale asked me
to marry him.

173
00:12:16,735 --> 00:12:18,612
That's why I've come.

174
00:12:19,488 --> 00:12:21,911
I thought you should know.

175
00:12:23,158 --> 00:12:24,284
Oh.

176
00:12:27,579 --> 00:12:32,506
I think that's...
That's wonderful, Annie.

177
00:12:32,876 --> 00:12:35,095
I said I had to think about it.

178
00:12:37,798 --> 00:12:40,051
Oh, men love that answer.

179
00:12:42,719 --> 00:12:45,893
I wondered what you
thought I should do.

180
00:12:50,394 --> 00:12:53,648
You could do a lot worse
than John Gale.

181
00:12:54,981 --> 00:12:56,779
He's a good man.

182
00:12:56,942 --> 00:12:59,070
So are you.

183
00:12:59,236 --> 00:13:00,613
No.

184
00:13:01,488 --> 00:13:03,239
I'm not.

185
00:13:03,406 --> 00:13:06,285
I'm many things,
but a good man is not one of them.

186
00:13:07,910 --> 00:13:09,787
But you could be.

187
00:13:11,455 --> 00:13:13,128
If you wanted to.

188
00:13:14,458 --> 00:13:16,460
Well, that's just it.

189
00:13:17,461 --> 00:13:18,963
I don't want to.

190
00:13:20,172 --> 00:13:23,597
See, Kansas is full
of good men.

191
00:13:23,759 --> 00:13:28,435
Church-going men that get
married and raise families.

192
00:13:28,597 --> 00:13:30,975
Men like John Gale.

193
00:13:31,142 --> 00:13:33,190
Men like my father,

194
00:13:34,145 --> 00:13:37,194
who spent his whole
life tilling the dirt

195
00:13:37,356 --> 00:13:40,200
just to die facedown in it.

196
00:13:41,444 --> 00:13:43,321
I don't want that, Annie.

197
00:13:44,488 --> 00:13:48,118
I don't want to be a good man,
I want to be a great one.

198
00:13:48,284 --> 00:13:52,960
I want to be Harry Houdini
and Thomas Edison

199
00:13:53,122 --> 00:13:55,170
all rolled into one.

200
00:14:08,846 --> 00:14:11,895
That's all I ever
wanted for you, you know.

201
00:14:14,518 --> 00:14:16,065
Greatness.

202
00:14:17,521 --> 00:14:19,649
Then you understand.

203
00:14:19,815 --> 00:14:21,237
I do.

204
00:14:22,651 --> 00:14:24,494
But do you?

205
00:14:25,613 --> 00:14:27,785
Uh, Professor, you need
to look outside.

206
00:14:31,868 --> 00:14:34,667
No, Vlad, please.
It was his grandmother's.

207
00:14:34,746 --> 00:14:35,872
- Ahl

208
00:14:36,247 --> 00:14:38,249
I'm gonna rip him in half!

209
00:14:40,460 --> 00:14:42,133
- No, please!
- Get off!

210
00:14:42,378 --> 00:14:44,130
It was just his
grandmother's music box.

211
00:14:44,214 --> 00:14:45,386
It meant nothing.

212
00:14:45,590 --> 00:14:46,591
Oz!

213
00:14:48,218 --> 00:14:49,595
I have to go.

214
00:14:49,761 --> 00:14:51,980
Congratulations on
the engagement.

215
00:14:52,680 --> 00:14:53,647
Oscar.

216
00:14:53,723 --> 00:14:55,817
I'll see you in my dreams.

217
00:15:02,732 --> 00:15:03,733
Oz!

218
00:15:03,900 --> 00:15:05,902
I'm gonna rip your head off!

219
00:15:06,736 --> 00:15:08,909
Zim Zallah Bim!

220
00:15:19,332 --> 00:15:20,333
Oz!

221
00:15:24,087 --> 00:15:27,341
There he is!
He's out here!

222
00:15:27,507 --> 00:15:29,475
No, Vlad! Don't hurt him!

223
00:15:30,093 --> 00:15:31,265
Vlad!

224
00:15:31,427 --> 00:15:33,054
- Vlad, no!
- Whoa!

225
00:15:35,014 --> 00:15:36,857
I'm gonna crush you, Oz!

226
00:15:39,477 --> 00:15:41,479
I'm gonna crush you!

227
00:15:41,646 --> 00:15:42,943
Oz! Where are you going?

228
00:15:43,106 --> 00:15:45,985
Mr. Baum, I'll catch up
with you in Milwaukee.

229
00:15:46,150 --> 00:15:47,948
Half of that balloon is mine!

230
00:15:48,111 --> 00:15:49,657
And the other half is mine!

231
00:15:50,612 --> 00:15:53,616
All right, you loafers!
Roll up those tents!

232
00:15:59,496 --> 00:16:00,497
Oz!

233
00:16:03,959 --> 00:16:05,552
- No, no, no.
- You're not getting away!

234
00:16:05,961 --> 00:16:06,962
Where's my thing?

235
00:16:09,548 --> 00:16:11,892
Come here.
Get him down, Clowny.

236
00:16:13,635 --> 00:16:17,185
No, you don't!
Oh, no, you don't!

237
00:16:23,270 --> 00:16:24,237
Ah!

238
00:16:26,315 --> 00:16:27,316
So long, sucker!

239
00:16:27,524 --> 00:16:28,571
Get back here!

240
00:16:29,526 --> 00:16:30,652
Oz!

241
00:16:30,819 --> 00:16:32,696
Oz, you're gonna need these!

242
00:16:32,863 --> 00:16:34,661
Throw it! Now!

243
00:16:35,657 --> 00:16:37,000
- Hat!
- Hat!

244
00:16:38,785 --> 00:16:39,786
Ha-ha!

245
00:16:40,329 --> 00:16:41,501
You're a dead man!

246
00:16:41,663 --> 00:16:44,667
Farewell!
Au revoir! Auf Wiedersehen!

247
00:16:45,876 --> 00:16:47,253
Run!

248
00:16:47,336 --> 00:16:48,553
Run!

249
00:16:58,221 --> 00:17:02,897
No, no, no, no, no! No!

250
00:17:10,901 --> 00:17:12,869
Whoa!

251
00:17:47,228 --> 00:17:50,482
Please, I don't wanna die!

252
00:17:50,731 --> 00:17:52,654
I haven't
accomplished anything yet!

253
00:17:52,817 --> 00:17:56,242
Just get me out of here
and I'll do great things!

254
00:17:56,404 --> 00:17:59,328
Please! Give me a chance!

255
00:17:59,490 --> 00:18:01,083
I promise!

256
00:18:01,242 --> 00:18:03,961
I promise. I can change.

257
00:19:45,136 --> 00:19:48,857
Thank you. Thank you!

258
00:20:20,546 --> 00:20:22,389
Come on, come on!

259
00:20:23,215 --> 00:20:25,183
Come on, come on!

260
00:20:51,243 --> 00:20:52,415
Oh, no!

261
00:22:37,682 --> 00:22:39,184
No, no. No, no.
Come on, buddy.

262
00:22:41,018 --> 00:22:44,022
I can't swim.
No! I can't swim.

263
00:22:48,901 --> 00:22:50,902
Somebody, help me!

264
00:23:28,356 --> 00:23:29,733
Thank goodness.

265
00:23:30,900 --> 00:23:32,867
I thought I was dead.

266
00:23:34,111 --> 00:23:37,910
Unless you're an angel.
Am I in heaven?

267
00:23:41,241 --> 00:23:43,368
There is still hope for me!

268
00:23:43,743 --> 00:23:45,415
You won't regret this!

269
00:23:45,577 --> 00:23:47,750
I saw you fall from the sky.

270
00:23:47,870 --> 00:23:52,420
Oh. Uh... Yes, my balloon
hit, uh, an inverted thermal.

271
00:23:52,540 --> 00:23:53,882
I couldn't compensate.

272
00:23:54,291 --> 00:23:56,259
I'd get out
of the water if I were you.

273
00:23:56,918 --> 00:23:59,386
Oh. It's actually quite nice.

274
00:23:59,545 --> 00:24:01,592
I'd be more concerned
with the River Fairies.

275
00:24:01,755 --> 00:24:04,257
Their teeth are small,
but very sharp.

276
00:24:04,548 --> 00:24:07,096
River Fairies?
What's a River Fairy?

277
00:24:07,175 --> 00:24:08,176
- Ow!

278
00:24:08,760 --> 00:24:11,228
Ow! Get off!

279
00:24:12,220 --> 00:24:13,220
Ow! Ow!

280
00:24:17,432 --> 00:24:18,432
Psst. Psst.

281
00:24:20,267 --> 00:24:21,609
Go on, get out of here.

282
00:24:36,487 --> 00:24:39,160
Spiteful little things,
aren't they?

283
00:24:41,782 --> 00:24:44,250
Where...
Where am I, exactly?

284
00:24:44,408 --> 00:24:46,159
Where do you think you are?

285
00:24:46,785 --> 00:24:49,128
I have no idea. It's...

286
00:24:50,788 --> 00:24:52,789
It's like no place
I've ever seen.

287
00:24:53,247 --> 00:24:54,920
You're in Oz.

288
00:24:55,665 --> 00:24:56,917
Oz?

289
00:24:58,501 --> 00:25:00,174
But that's my name.

290
00:25:00,336 --> 00:25:02,337
Oscar Zoroaster
Phadrig Isaac Norman

291
00:25:02,462 --> 00:25:03,805
Henkle Emmanuel Ambroise Diggs.

292
00:25:04,963 --> 00:25:08,136
But everyone calls me Oz.

293
00:25:11,593 --> 00:25:15,313
I knew it!
The king's prophecy was true.

294
00:25:15,596 --> 00:25:17,796
He said that a great wizard
bearing the name of our land

295
00:25:18,139 --> 00:25:20,982
will descend
from the heavens, and save us all.

296
00:25:21,308 --> 00:25:22,934
And here you are.

297
00:25:23,142 --> 00:25:24,815
Here to claim your throne.

298
00:25:24,977 --> 00:25:26,319
"Claim my throne"?

299
00:25:27,437 --> 00:25:28,983
You mean, like a king's throne?

300
00:25:29,146 --> 00:25:31,695
Well, yes. Because
you will be our king.

301
00:25:32,023 --> 00:25:33,616
Your king?

302
00:25:33,775 --> 00:25:36,994
Like, in a palace with
a crown and a scepter?

303
00:25:37,152 --> 00:25:40,951
Yes, a beautiful scepter
and a grand palace.

304
00:25:41,114 --> 00:25:43,787
Oh. And you will
save all the people.

305
00:25:44,157 --> 00:25:46,500
Was that a gold scepter?

306
00:25:47,617 --> 00:25:50,711
Yes, there's more gold
than you could ever imagine.

307
00:25:50,869 --> 00:25:54,168
And Oz will now be
what it once was.

308
00:25:55,957 --> 00:25:58,334
Because you are
the Wizard, aren't you?

309
00:26:01,794 --> 00:26:03,215
Yes.

310
00:26:03,670 --> 00:26:05,172
I'm the Wizard.

311
00:26:13,718 --> 00:26:16,436
- What was that?
- The Wicked Witch's minions.

312
00:26:16,512 --> 00:26:17,873
They've been sent here
to kill you.

313
00:26:17,888 --> 00:26:19,013
Kill me?

314
00:26:19,180 --> 00:26:20,397
A wicked witch? What?

315
00:26:20,515 --> 00:26:21,731
- Oh!

316
00:26:22,349 --> 00:26:25,522
We better hurry or your reign will be
over before it's begun!

317
00:26:26,811 --> 00:26:28,062
- Whoa!
- Whoa!

318
00:26:30,896 --> 00:26:33,774
- Oh! Whoa!
- Oh!

319
00:26:40,361 --> 00:26:41,362
Come on!

320
00:26:45,865 --> 00:26:46,866
In there!

321
00:26:48,741 --> 00:26:50,038
Give me your leg.

322
00:26:52,661 --> 00:26:54,379
- Huh?

323
00:27:08,005 --> 00:27:11,725
Oh... Perhaps the Wicked Witch
has summoned them back.

324
00:27:12,884 --> 00:27:14,760
I don't think I like witches.

325
00:27:17,219 --> 00:27:18,391
What?

326
00:27:19,179 --> 00:27:21,398
I... I, too,
am a witch.

327
00:27:21,556 --> 00:27:23,603
I am Theodora the Good.

328
00:27:26,225 --> 00:27:27,226
You're not a witch.

329
00:27:27,393 --> 00:27:28,393
Of course I am.

330
00:27:28,560 --> 00:27:31,109
Where are all your warts?
Where's your broom?

331
00:27:31,271 --> 00:27:33,398
What would I do with a broom?

332
00:27:33,564 --> 00:27:34,610
Fly.

333
00:27:34,772 --> 00:27:36,399
With a broom?

334
00:27:37,442 --> 00:27:38,488
Never mind.

335
00:28:26,807 --> 00:28:27,933
You were afraid?

336
00:28:28,434 --> 00:28:29,435
Yes.

337
00:28:32,978 --> 00:28:34,901
That something
might happen to you.

338
00:28:49,782 --> 00:28:52,455
So, this Wicked Witch,

339
00:28:52,617 --> 00:28:54,289
just how wicked is she?

340
00:28:54,451 --> 00:28:56,052
She's as wicked as they come.

341
00:28:56,203 --> 00:28:57,795
She poisoned her own father.

342
00:28:58,120 --> 00:28:59,087
That's pretty wicked.

343
00:28:59,163 --> 00:29:01,665
He was a king
and a wizard, like you.

344
00:29:01,831 --> 00:29:03,958
But she wanted the throne
all to herself.

345
00:29:04,500 --> 00:29:05,501
Poor man.

346
00:29:06,293 --> 00:29:09,466
But my sister chased her away
from the Emerald City.

347
00:29:09,962 --> 00:29:11,714
I can't wait
for her to meet you.

348
00:29:11,880 --> 00:29:14,803
She was starting to doubt you'd ever
come but now she'll see.

349
00:29:14,966 --> 00:29:17,309
And you're going to
fix everything.

350
00:29:18,801 --> 00:29:19,848
Yeah.

351
00:29:43,484 --> 00:29:45,828
You know what I think we need?

352
00:29:50,364 --> 00:29:53,207
A little music.

353
00:29:54,117 --> 00:29:55,493
Is that magic?

354
00:29:55,659 --> 00:29:56,660
In a way.

355
00:29:57,452 --> 00:30:01,297
It's a music box.
You've never seen one?

356
00:30:01,871 --> 00:30:04,044
Well, this belonged to
my grandmother.

357
00:30:04,165 --> 00:30:06,462
A tsarina from Mirkutsk.

358
00:30:08,585 --> 00:30:09,677
Go on.

359
00:30:11,461 --> 00:30:13,304
I want you to have it.

360
00:30:16,048 --> 00:30:19,677
No one's ever given me anything
just because they wanted to.

361
00:30:19,843 --> 00:30:21,560
A pretty girl like you?

362
00:30:21,719 --> 00:30:24,062
With the visage
of Helen of Troy, no less?

363
00:30:24,137 --> 00:30:26,230
I'm sure you have
dozens of admirers.

364
00:30:26,388 --> 00:30:28,311
You don't know much
about witches, do you?

365
00:30:28,473 --> 00:30:31,726
Maybe not, but I'm told
I'm a fast learner.

366
00:30:32,184 --> 00:30:34,311
May I have this dance, milady?

367
00:30:36,478 --> 00:30:39,037
Now you're gonna tell me no one's ever
asked you to dance before.

368
00:30:39,606 --> 00:30:41,199
No one ever has.

369
00:30:41,357 --> 00:30:44,360
Then it's high time
that you learned.

370
00:30:53,032 --> 00:30:55,125
Put your hand here.

371
00:30:56,242 --> 00:30:58,585
And your other hand here.

372
00:31:13,420 --> 00:31:15,047
Nice, isn't it?

373
00:31:16,547 --> 00:31:18,094
Yes.

374
00:31:54,073 --> 00:31:55,198
It's incredible.

375
00:31:55,281 --> 00:31:56,282
Yeah.

376
00:31:56,407 --> 00:31:58,750
Here I thought
I'd live a lonely life

377
00:31:58,909 --> 00:32:00,126
and then you showed up.

378
00:32:02,078 --> 00:32:04,250
Not only are you the Wizard

379
00:32:05,580 --> 00:32:08,002
but you're the person
I belong with.

380
00:32:09,249 --> 00:32:12,092
Well, we sure
get along. And...

381
00:32:12,335 --> 00:32:13,756
And?

382
00:32:14,753 --> 00:32:16,504
And.

383
00:32:16,671 --> 00:32:19,514
Like you said,
we belong together.

384
00:32:19,589 --> 00:32:22,263
Oh! I was hoping
you would say that.

385
00:32:22,425 --> 00:32:23,767
- Yeah.

386
00:32:24,301 --> 00:32:25,802
Help me!

387
00:32:25,968 --> 00:32:28,391
Somebody, save me!

388
00:32:28,471 --> 00:32:29,938
That poor little creature.

389
00:32:31,014 --> 00:32:33,436
Wizard, we must save him.

390
00:32:33,599 --> 00:32:34,941
Somebody, help me.

391
00:32:35,308 --> 00:32:36,480
Oh, no, no, no.

392
00:32:36,935 --> 00:32:38,436
Allow the Wizard.

393
00:32:38,769 --> 00:32:39,941
Help me!
Come on!

394
00:32:40,521 --> 00:32:42,864
Of course I'll save this

395
00:32:42,939 --> 00:32:46,238
little talking monkey
in a bellhop's uniform.

396
00:32:46,400 --> 00:32:49,243
You, mister!
Please, hurry up.

397
00:32:49,402 --> 00:32:51,904
Do you have anything sharp?
Like a knife or something.

398
00:32:52,070 --> 00:32:54,071
How about your teeth?
What kind of teeth you got?

399
00:32:54,405 --> 00:32:57,453
Calm down,
it's gonna be all right.

400
00:32:57,615 --> 00:32:58,616
You gotta get me
out of these vines.

401
00:32:58,783 --> 00:33:00,159
Calm down.

402
00:33:00,909 --> 00:33:03,127
I'm gonna die.
It's gonna eat me.

403
00:33:03,577 --> 00:33:06,329
Don't worry. These vines
aren't gonna eat you.

404
00:33:07,122 --> 00:33:09,123
Not the vines, the lion!

405
00:33:10,999 --> 00:33:11,999
- Lion?

406
00:33:12,166 --> 00:33:13,383
We're gonna die.

407
00:33:13,626 --> 00:33:14,865
- We're gonna die!

408
00:33:17,462 --> 00:33:19,839
Eat him first!
Eat him first!

409
00:33:25,634 --> 00:33:27,306
Zim Zallah Bim!

410
00:33:27,468 --> 00:33:31,517
Be gone, coward!
Fear my greatness!

411
00:33:32,472 --> 00:33:34,189
- You were wonderful, Wizard.

412
00:33:34,515 --> 00:33:35,516
"Wizard"?

413
00:33:35,683 --> 00:33:37,526
You mean the prophecy was true?

414
00:33:37,685 --> 00:33:38,811
Indeed.

415
00:33:38,978 --> 00:33:41,107
All right, well,
I've saved the day.

416
00:33:41,273 --> 00:33:44,277
It was nothing, just a little
prestidigitatic display.

417
00:33:44,443 --> 00:33:46,696
- Shall we to the palace?
- Oh! Yes.

418
00:33:46,862 --> 00:33:47,909
Good day, sir.

419
00:33:47,988 --> 00:33:49,490
Wait, please, sir.

420
00:33:49,657 --> 00:33:51,330
My name is Finley.

421
00:33:51,492 --> 00:33:54,666
My master's home was ransacked
by the Wicked Witch's baboons.

422
00:33:54,829 --> 00:33:57,332
And I've been hiding
in these woods ever since.

423
00:33:57,498 --> 00:34:00,548
But now you've saved
my life, oh, Wizard.

424
00:34:00,711 --> 00:34:03,681
So I hereby swear
a life debt to you.

425
00:34:03,756 --> 00:34:04,757
No... No need.

426
00:34:04,840 --> 00:34:10,393
From this moment on I shall be your
loyal and faithful servant until death.

427
00:34:12,682 --> 00:34:14,309
Well, he is cute.

428
00:34:17,228 --> 00:34:18,525
All right, you're hired.

429
00:34:18,605 --> 00:34:19,606
Wonderful.

430
00:34:19,690 --> 00:34:20,907
Let's shake on it.

431
00:34:21,525 --> 00:34:22,526
My bag, monkey.

432
00:34:23,027 --> 00:34:25,701
Surely.
You must travel light.

433
00:34:28,365 --> 00:34:29,537
I got it.

434
00:34:30,911 --> 00:34:32,538
You two run along.

435
00:34:40,713 --> 00:34:42,556
It's the Emerald City.

436
00:34:42,715 --> 00:34:45,434
Just down this hill,
along the Yellow Brick Road.

437
00:34:45,593 --> 00:34:46,765
Wow.

438
00:34:47,220 --> 00:34:49,564
It'll all be ours now.

439
00:34:50,224 --> 00:34:52,272
It's a good thing
green is my favorite color.

440
00:34:55,771 --> 00:34:59,241
You are going to make the
best king Oz has ever known.

441
00:35:00,068 --> 00:35:01,240
Thank you.

442
00:35:01,402 --> 00:35:03,871
And I will be so proud
to be your queen.

443
00:35:05,365 --> 00:35:06,366
My queen?

444
00:35:06,449 --> 00:35:08,122
We'll spend
a lifetime together.

445
00:35:08,409 --> 00:35:10,037
But right now, there's
thousands of people in Oz

446
00:35:10,204 --> 00:35:13,253
waiting to witness
your miracles.

447
00:35:20,173 --> 00:35:23,928
Thousands?
That's a big show.

448
00:35:26,471 --> 00:35:27,518
Phew!

449
00:35:27,597 --> 00:35:28,769
What now, Wizard?

450
00:35:29,224 --> 00:35:32,855
Monkey, tell me again
about that life debt.

451
00:35:33,020 --> 00:35:34,522
- I devote my life to you.
- Mmm-hmm.

452
00:35:34,689 --> 00:35:36,942
Whatever you wish,
whatever you want.

453
00:35:37,108 --> 00:35:39,531
It is my sworn duty
to deliver for you

454
00:35:39,610 --> 00:35:41,784
- until the end of my days.
- Mmm-hmm.

455
00:35:41,947 --> 00:35:43,227
And there's
no getting out of it?

456
00:35:43,365 --> 00:35:45,288
None, sir.
It is irrevocable.

457
00:35:45,450 --> 00:35:47,623
Good.
Because I'm not the Wizard.

458
00:35:51,374 --> 00:35:55,379
Oh, sir, your sense of humor
is as boundless as it is wondrous.

459
00:35:55,461 --> 00:35:57,555
- You remind me...
- Monkey.

460
00:35:57,630 --> 00:35:59,098
I'm not the Wizard.

461
00:36:00,426 --> 00:36:02,746
Well, you could have told me
before I sealed the life debt.

462
00:36:02,887 --> 00:36:03,934
It's too late.

463
00:36:04,096 --> 00:36:06,096
You got to come clean
for that innocent young girl.

464
00:36:06,140 --> 00:36:08,142
I'll deal with her later.

465
00:36:08,309 --> 00:36:11,314
As my new assistant
all you need to know are the three "ups".

466
00:36:11,479 --> 00:36:13,152
Show up, keep up, shut up.

467
00:36:13,273 --> 00:36:14,240
But...

468
00:36:14,316 --> 00:36:15,317
What's the third "up"?

469
00:36:18,445 --> 00:36:21,620
Right. Now, listen,
I'm depending on you.

470
00:36:21,782 --> 00:36:24,160
We need to convince
the good people of Oz

471
00:36:24,660 --> 00:36:26,662
that they've found
their wizard.

472
00:36:40,345 --> 00:36:41,392
Hello, Knuck.

473
00:36:41,554 --> 00:36:43,682
Theodora, we've been
expecting you.

474
00:36:43,765 --> 00:36:45,608
I shall blow a fanfare.

475
00:36:47,060 --> 00:36:49,939
No, no, no, no.
No. Not now.

476
00:36:51,357 --> 00:36:53,576
This is the Wizard.

477
00:36:53,734 --> 00:36:54,735
How do you do, sir?

478
00:36:55,027 --> 00:36:56,950
- This is the Wizard?

479
00:36:57,112 --> 00:36:58,113
Is there a problem?

480
00:37:01,076 --> 00:37:02,419
Yeah.

481
00:37:04,412 --> 00:37:05,959
- Halt.

482
00:37:08,541 --> 00:37:10,260
All hail the Wizard.

483
00:37:10,419 --> 00:37:11,859
All hail the Wizard.

484
00:37:11,963 --> 00:37:14,887
All hail the Wizard.
The mightiest of mighties.

485
00:37:15,132 --> 00:37:16,975
The greatest, most powerful

486
00:37:17,134 --> 00:37:20,730
and most genuine
of real and true wizards.

487
00:37:20,806 --> 00:37:21,807
Thank you.

488
00:37:21,890 --> 00:37:25,235
A wizard above scrutiny
with no covert agenda

489
00:37:25,394 --> 00:37:27,817
or subversive intention
whatsoever.

490
00:37:28,605 --> 00:37:31,735
- Okay.
- A wizard of the highest moral rectitude.

491
00:37:31,901 --> 00:37:36,281
He's just a real, good,
solid wizard, everyone.

492
00:37:36,447 --> 00:37:38,916
The Wizard, here he is.

493
00:37:41,078 --> 00:37:42,250
How'd I do?

494
00:37:43,706 --> 00:37:44,923
Forward, march!

495
00:37:45,082 --> 00:37:47,255
Hello? Guys?

496
00:37:47,418 --> 00:37:49,386
Can I get in the carriage?

497
00:37:49,545 --> 00:37:51,969
Can I please
get in the carriage?

498
00:38:04,562 --> 00:38:07,281
- I shall blow a fanfare.
- Not now.

499
00:38:10,277 --> 00:38:14,657
Is that it? Is that my throne?

500
00:38:16,616 --> 00:38:18,414
Do you like it?

501
00:38:20,455 --> 00:38:22,173
I do so hope you like it,

502
00:38:22,331 --> 00:38:26,632
because I've been personally watching
over it awaiting your arrival.

503
00:38:26,711 --> 00:38:27,712
Oh...

504
00:38:27,962 --> 00:38:29,179
Much obliged.

505
00:38:29,338 --> 00:38:32,639
Praise be you are here at last

506
00:38:32,801 --> 00:38:35,475
and the prophecy
shall be fulfilled.

507
00:38:35,637 --> 00:38:39,517
Oh, this is a glorious day
for us all.

508
00:38:39,683 --> 00:38:44,690
And may I add, you're as
handsome a king as we've ever had.

509
00:38:45,106 --> 00:38:46,824
Flatterer.

510
00:38:46,983 --> 00:38:50,203
Who is this fetching woman?

511
00:38:51,197 --> 00:38:52,790
This is my sister.

512
00:38:52,948 --> 00:38:56,168
I am Evanora,
the royal advisor.

513
00:38:56,327 --> 00:39:00,002
I have been protecting the Emerald City
whilst we awaited your arrival.

514
00:39:00,164 --> 00:39:04,215
I am here to serve
you as I served the king before you.

515
00:39:04,377 --> 00:39:07,176
Well, I look forward
to being served.

516
00:39:07,339 --> 00:39:09,637
Oh, sister, I like him already.

517
00:39:12,512 --> 00:39:13,513
Oh... My scepter.

518
00:39:13,679 --> 00:39:16,228
Oh, yes,
go on then, have a seat.

519
00:39:16,390 --> 00:39:17,687
How does it feel?

520
00:39:17,850 --> 00:39:20,023
Fits like a glove.

521
00:39:20,979 --> 00:39:23,027
Goodness.
Knuck will show you to your chambers

522
00:39:23,190 --> 00:39:24,487
and then we can, uh...

523
00:39:24,566 --> 00:39:26,694
We can chat more later.

524
00:39:26,860 --> 00:39:29,579
Can't wait. Monkey, my bag.

525
00:39:29,738 --> 00:39:32,993
Yes, Wizard, right away,
oh, great and powerful one.

526
00:39:36,830 --> 00:39:38,350
- Thank you, sourpuss.
- Whoa!

527
00:39:38,414 --> 00:39:40,713
My name is Knuck!

528
00:39:43,754 --> 00:39:47,179
Isn't he wonderful?
Didn't I say he would come?

529
00:39:47,341 --> 00:39:51,222
You dare escort
that oaf in here

530
00:39:51,388 --> 00:39:54,016
and allow him to climb
on the hallowed throne?

531
00:39:54,182 --> 00:39:57,026
And why not?
He is the Wizard.

532
00:39:57,185 --> 00:39:59,483
"The Wizard." Or so he says.

533
00:39:59,646 --> 00:40:02,742
Did it not occur to you

534
00:40:02,900 --> 00:40:05,870
that he might be an imposter in
league with the Wicked Witch

535
00:40:06,028 --> 00:40:07,405
and sent here to kill us?

536
00:40:07,572 --> 00:40:09,415
The Wicked Witch?
Don't be ridiculous.

537
00:40:09,574 --> 00:40:13,421
I'm not the one
who's underestimating her cleverness.

538
00:40:15,914 --> 00:40:18,884
Or maybe it's you
I'm underestimating.

539
00:40:20,169 --> 00:40:24,016
Have you finally
joined her side, sister?

540
00:40:24,382 --> 00:40:28,262
I am on no one's side.
You know that.

541
00:40:28,428 --> 00:40:29,725
I simply want peace.

542
00:40:29,888 --> 00:40:31,937
It's all I ever wanted,
and the Wizard can do that.

543
00:40:32,099 --> 00:40:33,100
He's a good man.

544
00:40:33,267 --> 00:40:34,735
What do you know
about goodness?

545
00:40:34,810 --> 00:40:36,107
Deep down, you are wicked.

546
00:40:36,270 --> 00:40:37,817
I am not wicked!

547
00:40:42,777 --> 00:40:46,122
That temper
really is wasted on you.

548
00:40:47,699 --> 00:40:50,202
Do you honestly think

549
00:40:50,368 --> 00:40:53,919
that I could conspire
against you with her?

550
00:40:54,081 --> 00:40:56,800
You are my sister
and I love you.

551
00:41:02,549 --> 00:41:04,142
All right.

552
00:41:04,927 --> 00:41:08,602
But I do need proof that
he is who he claims to be.

553
00:41:08,764 --> 00:41:10,893
But he has already
proven himself.

554
00:41:11,059 --> 00:41:13,107
Not to me, he hasn't.

555
00:41:19,234 --> 00:41:20,656
Thank you for the tour.

556
00:41:20,819 --> 00:41:22,412
It's my job.

557
00:41:22,571 --> 00:41:23,618
Giving tours?

558
00:41:23,781 --> 00:41:25,579
Taking care of the king.

559
00:41:25,741 --> 00:41:27,334
Of course.
And on that note

560
00:41:27,493 --> 00:41:30,964
I was thinking it might be
nice to have a royal feast.

561
00:41:31,122 --> 00:41:32,089
Maybe a grand roast.

562
00:41:32,165 --> 00:41:36,671
You know, my sister has been telling me
that your magic is really quite powerful.

563
00:41:36,836 --> 00:41:38,008
Oh, really?

564
00:41:38,171 --> 00:41:42,803
Yes, uh, boggling to the minds
of all who witness it.

565
00:41:42,969 --> 00:41:44,346
Oh, I do wish I could
see it for myself.

566
00:41:44,512 --> 00:41:45,513
- Yes.

567
00:41:45,680 --> 00:41:47,182
Why not show me now?

568
00:41:47,682 --> 00:41:49,355
- Now?
- Here.

569
00:41:50,643 --> 00:41:52,692
All things in good time.

570
00:41:52,854 --> 00:41:56,199
And a good time for all things.

571
00:41:57,859 --> 00:42:01,034
So wise. So true.

572
00:42:02,031 --> 00:42:03,954
Well, um,
there is one last room

573
00:42:04,033 --> 00:42:06,377
that I would like you to see.

574
00:42:06,536 --> 00:42:09,710
The royal treasure of Oz.

575
00:42:17,673 --> 00:42:19,846
It belongs to whoever is king.

576
00:42:25,181 --> 00:42:26,899
It's all right, Wizard.

577
00:42:27,058 --> 00:42:29,561
Go and enjoy your riches.

578
00:42:36,402 --> 00:42:38,404
It's mine!

579
00:42:38,571 --> 00:42:40,039
Mine!

580
00:42:40,197 --> 00:42:43,327
Oh, no more second-hand suits
for you, baby!

581
00:42:43,410 --> 00:42:45,913
Nothing but
the silks and satins!

582
00:42:46,079 --> 00:42:48,502
Ali Baba!

583
00:42:52,003 --> 00:42:55,473
And one of these things!
What is this?

584
00:42:55,590 --> 00:42:58,594
- A chalice.
- A chalice!

585
00:42:58,760 --> 00:43:03,232
I've always wanted a chalice.
And now I've got one.

586
00:43:03,390 --> 00:43:06,314
Well, uh, not quite yet.

587
00:43:06,894 --> 00:43:09,647
You see,
you only become the king

588
00:43:09,730 --> 00:43:11,733
after you defeat
the Wicked Witch.

589
00:43:11,900 --> 00:43:13,277
That's the prophecy.

590
00:43:13,443 --> 00:43:16,572
And since you haven't
done that yet, you're not...

591
00:43:16,738 --> 00:43:18,957
- I'm not actually king.
- Not yet, no.

592
00:43:19,115 --> 00:43:22,370
You still have to
get rid of the Wicked Witch.

593
00:43:22,536 --> 00:43:24,038
Right.

594
00:43:24,955 --> 00:43:27,799
And killing her won't be easy.

595
00:43:27,958 --> 00:43:29,551
No, I don't suppose it will be.

596
00:43:29,627 --> 00:43:30,719
Mmm.

597
00:43:31,380 --> 00:43:32,882
Wait a minute.

598
00:43:33,048 --> 00:43:34,925
No one said anything
about killing anybody.

599
00:43:35,133 --> 00:43:38,979
Oh. Well, if you're not interested in
being king that's all right with me.

600
00:43:39,137 --> 00:43:40,559
We can just forget about
the whole thing.

601
00:43:40,722 --> 00:43:44,102
The gold and the rubies,
the chalice.

602
00:43:44,268 --> 00:43:45,861
I'm interested!

603
00:43:46,020 --> 00:43:48,569
I'm just not too keen
on killing a lady.

604
00:43:48,731 --> 00:43:50,733
She's not a lady.

605
00:43:51,652 --> 00:43:54,030
She's a wicked witch.

606
00:43:54,196 --> 00:43:57,746
And your magic is the only
thing strong enough to destroy her.

607
00:43:57,908 --> 00:44:00,832
All you have to do is journey
to the Dark Forest

608
00:44:00,911 --> 00:44:02,038
and destroy her wand.

609
00:44:02,205 --> 00:44:03,206
- Her wand.
- Yes.

610
00:44:03,373 --> 00:44:04,420
It's the source of
all her power.

611
00:44:04,582 --> 00:44:06,380
Without it, she dies.

612
00:44:06,543 --> 00:44:09,296
I haven't even said
goodbye to Theodora. She will be upset.

613
00:44:09,462 --> 00:44:10,588
I will talk to her
in the morning.

614
00:44:10,672 --> 00:44:12,234
I will tell her
how much you love her...

615
00:44:12,591 --> 00:44:13,683
No.

616
00:44:14,552 --> 00:44:16,304
No, don't...
Don't say anything.

617
00:44:16,470 --> 00:44:20,475
All right. I will say whatever
it is you want me to say

618
00:44:20,641 --> 00:44:24,818
but are you going to
save us all or not?

619
00:44:36,200 --> 00:44:37,543
I'm your wizard.

620
00:44:41,204 --> 00:44:42,922
We're really gonna do this?

621
00:44:43,081 --> 00:44:44,924
How hard could it be
to kill a wicked witch?

622
00:44:45,083 --> 00:44:47,131
Hard. Really hard.

623
00:44:47,294 --> 00:44:50,172
It's very, very hard
to kill a wicked witch.

624
00:44:50,337 --> 00:44:52,055
And what about that
poor girl back there?

625
00:44:52,131 --> 00:44:54,259
I think she really liked you.

626
00:44:54,425 --> 00:44:57,304
She'll get over me.
They always do.

627
00:44:57,470 --> 00:44:58,550
She's a pretty young witch.

628
00:44:58,553 --> 00:45:00,553
There'll be plenty
of wizards knocking at her door.

629
00:45:00,597 --> 00:45:04,318
Oh, every lie you tell gets us one step
closer to the Emerald City dungeon.

630
00:45:04,476 --> 00:45:06,353
Then don't think
of them as lies.

631
00:45:06,518 --> 00:45:09,647
Think of them as stepping
stones on the road to greatness.

632
00:45:09,730 --> 00:45:10,731
Wait, I got it.

633
00:45:10,814 --> 00:45:13,033
We'll turn around and go back.
You'll come clean.

634
00:45:13,192 --> 00:45:15,285
You apologize for lying
about being the Wizard

635
00:45:15,359 --> 00:45:16,986
and for lying
to that poor girl. Okay?

636
00:45:17,153 --> 00:45:19,656
You gotta really
seem contrite. You gotta sell it.

637
00:45:19,822 --> 00:45:22,666
Maybe you could even cry.
Can you cry? I could cut up an onion.

638
00:45:22,825 --> 00:45:24,076
We're not going back.

639
00:45:24,242 --> 00:45:25,710
We're gonna find
this wicked witch,

640
00:45:25,785 --> 00:45:27,002
steal her wand,

641
00:45:27,162 --> 00:45:28,664
I'll get that big pile of gold

642
00:45:28,830 --> 00:45:31,709
and you can have a nice
pile of bananas, all right?

643
00:45:31,875 --> 00:45:32,966
Bananas.

644
00:45:33,709 --> 00:45:34,710
Oh, I see.

645
00:45:34,793 --> 00:45:37,342
Because I'm a monkey,
I must love bananas, right?

646
00:45:37,505 --> 00:45:39,599
That is a vicious stereotype.

647
00:45:39,757 --> 00:45:41,429
- You don't like bananas?
- Of course I love bananas.

648
00:45:41,591 --> 00:45:42,763
I'm a monkey,
don't be ridiculous.

649
00:45:42,842 --> 00:45:43,934
I just don't like
you saying it.

650
00:45:44,010 --> 00:45:45,011
How about this?

651
00:45:45,094 --> 00:45:47,563
We offer to wash all the
windows in the Emerald City

652
00:45:47,722 --> 00:45:49,065
- for an entire year.
- Uh-huh.

653
00:45:49,140 --> 00:45:50,641
They'd have to forgive us.

654
00:45:50,807 --> 00:45:52,901
Or we could give them
a little help with their infrastructure.

655
00:45:53,060 --> 00:45:55,313
I noticed some yellow
brick potholes back there.

656
00:46:10,992 --> 00:46:12,960
That looks bad.

657
00:46:13,453 --> 00:46:14,625
We're not going down there.

658
00:46:14,788 --> 00:46:17,540
Someone might need our help.

659
00:46:17,706 --> 00:46:18,707
Not that you care.

660
00:46:18,791 --> 00:46:22,796
Get back here!
You get back here!

661
00:46:23,546 --> 00:46:26,890
We gotta get the Wicked Witch.
What are we doing over here?

662
00:46:39,226 --> 00:46:41,194
What happened here?

663
00:47:42,197 --> 00:47:43,870
Hello?

664
00:47:58,880 --> 00:48:00,051
- Hey, there.

665
00:48:01,298 --> 00:48:02,971
- Are you all right?

666
00:48:05,719 --> 00:48:07,971
Don't worry,
we're not gonna hurt you.

667
00:48:10,181 --> 00:48:11,478
This is Finley.

668
00:48:11,557 --> 00:48:12,558
Hi.

669
00:48:12,642 --> 00:48:13,814
My name is Oz.

670
00:48:15,686 --> 00:48:17,403
Are you...

671
00:48:18,021 --> 00:48:19,523
Are you the Wizard?

672
00:48:20,148 --> 00:48:22,025
Oh, you...
You've heard of me.

673
00:48:22,192 --> 00:48:24,160
Everyone has.

674
00:48:25,402 --> 00:48:27,746
Good. Then you know there's
nothing to be afraid of.

675
00:48:27,905 --> 00:48:31,205
So, just come on out of there.

676
00:48:32,201 --> 00:48:33,669
But I can't.

677
00:48:34,869 --> 00:48:37,543
Oh. All right, hold on.

678
00:48:41,751 --> 00:48:43,923
Get this off of you.

679
00:48:50,676 --> 00:48:52,427
Oh, no.

680
00:48:52,760 --> 00:48:56,731
I'll never get back together.

681
00:49:07,440 --> 00:49:09,407
Don't worry.
I think I have something.

682
00:49:09,566 --> 00:49:11,239
Give me that bag.

683
00:49:13,570 --> 00:49:16,995
I, uh, packed something...

684
00:49:17,949 --> 00:49:19,451
There it is.

685
00:49:20,827 --> 00:49:21,874
What is that?

686
00:49:21,953 --> 00:49:22,954
Magic in a bottle.

687
00:49:23,579 --> 00:49:24,922
Magic?

688
00:49:25,581 --> 00:49:27,082
Let's give it a try.

689
00:49:27,249 --> 00:49:28,967
All right.

690
00:49:32,295 --> 00:49:34,797
Just give it a little dab.

691
00:49:35,756 --> 00:49:37,303
Like so.

692
00:49:39,468 --> 00:49:41,095
Okay.

693
00:49:43,138 --> 00:49:44,685
Should work.

694
00:49:47,517 --> 00:49:49,315
There we go.

695
00:49:51,979 --> 00:49:52,980
Ta-da!

696
00:49:54,690 --> 00:49:55,691
Oh, no, no, no!

697
00:49:58,944 --> 00:49:59,945
They're coming back!

698
00:50:09,661 --> 00:50:11,504
It's okay.

699
00:50:15,459 --> 00:50:17,052
They're gone.

700
00:50:18,711 --> 00:50:22,432
- The Wicked Witch sent them.
- Why?

701
00:50:24,091 --> 00:50:26,014
Last night.

702
00:50:26,177 --> 00:50:30,101
The whole town was celebrating
out in the streets

703
00:50:30,263 --> 00:50:33,016
because we had heard
that you finally arrived.

704
00:50:34,017 --> 00:50:35,017
Me?

705
00:50:35,100 --> 00:50:37,353
Everyone was so happy.

706
00:50:39,354 --> 00:50:40,856
But then...

707
00:50:43,025 --> 00:50:45,072
But then those things flew in.

708
00:50:45,777 --> 00:50:47,779
And then...

709
00:50:47,945 --> 00:50:49,197
And then they...

710
00:51:00,582 --> 00:51:02,049
Here we go.

711
00:51:02,708 --> 00:51:04,631
Last piece.

712
00:51:16,638 --> 00:51:18,389
Would you like to try to stand?

713
00:51:24,728 --> 00:51:25,729
There.

714
00:51:26,647 --> 00:51:28,068
All right.

715
00:51:28,898 --> 00:51:30,445
There we go.

716
00:51:31,984 --> 00:51:33,577
Easy.

717
00:51:34,737 --> 00:51:35,737
Okay.

718
00:51:37,072 --> 00:51:38,995
- I'm gonna let you go.
- Oh!

719
00:51:41,785 --> 00:51:43,082
Okay.

720
00:51:45,830 --> 00:51:47,582
Now walk to me.

721
00:51:49,124 --> 00:51:50,922
I don't think I can.

722
00:51:51,085 --> 00:51:52,587
I think you can.

723
00:51:54,629 --> 00:51:55,630
Come on.

724
00:52:14,772 --> 00:52:15,989
All right.

725
00:52:16,148 --> 00:52:17,775
You did it.

726
00:52:21,444 --> 00:52:22,866
Thank you.

727
00:52:35,957 --> 00:52:38,210
"Dark Forest."

728
00:52:39,627 --> 00:52:41,846
All right, this is it.

729
00:52:42,338 --> 00:52:44,556
Just head on down that way,
about two, three hours.

730
00:52:44,715 --> 00:52:46,183
You'll hit the Emerald City.

731
00:52:46,341 --> 00:52:49,515
Tell them I sent you,
they'll take great care of you.

732
00:52:49,678 --> 00:52:51,351
Nice meeting you.

733
00:52:53,306 --> 00:52:54,398
But.

734
00:52:55,558 --> 00:52:57,652
I wanna go with you.

735
00:52:58,060 --> 00:52:59,482
What?

736
00:52:59,604 --> 00:53:00,730
Aw...

737
00:53:01,522 --> 00:53:03,364
On a witch hunt?

738
00:53:03,523 --> 00:53:04,991
No, you're just a little girl.

739
00:53:05,150 --> 00:53:07,323
I'm not as delicate as I look!

740
00:53:08,069 --> 00:53:09,070
That didn't hurt.

741
00:53:09,154 --> 00:53:10,655
I'm coming with you.

742
00:53:10,821 --> 00:53:13,540
Listen, we have one rule
in show business.

743
00:53:13,699 --> 00:53:15,701
Never work with
kids or animals.

744
00:53:15,868 --> 00:53:17,429
And I'm already working
with this thing.

745
00:53:17,453 --> 00:53:19,750
- Relax.

746
00:53:20,496 --> 00:53:21,668
The answer's no.

747
00:53:24,417 --> 00:53:26,340
Oh, no, no, no.

748
00:53:27,170 --> 00:53:29,046
Don't...
Don't do that.

749
00:53:29,171 --> 00:53:30,138
You're fine.

750
00:53:30,213 --> 00:53:32,181
You're gonna leave me alone.

751
00:53:32,341 --> 00:53:33,513
Look, you're...
You're fine.

752
00:53:33,675 --> 00:53:36,349
On a road in the
middle of nowhere?

753
00:53:36,510 --> 00:53:38,057
All you have to do
is take the Yellow Brick Road.

754
00:53:38,220 --> 00:53:39,392
You'll get there.

755
00:53:40,681 --> 00:53:42,183
It's crying again,
what do I do?

756
00:53:44,518 --> 00:53:45,894
Oh, no.

757
00:53:46,061 --> 00:53:48,189
Off. Come on. Off.

758
00:53:49,272 --> 00:53:50,774
Off of there!
Scat! Get off!

759
00:53:50,857 --> 00:53:51,978
Please let me come with you.

760
00:53:52,025 --> 00:53:53,026
No! Get off of there!

761
00:53:53,193 --> 00:53:54,785
I promise I won't bother you!

762
00:53:54,860 --> 00:53:55,941
No dolls on the witch hunt!

763
00:54:00,240 --> 00:54:01,400
- Please, let me come!
- Fine.

764
00:54:01,575 --> 00:54:03,451
Fine!
If you wanna come, come.

765
00:54:03,618 --> 00:54:05,370
We'll all go,
it'll be a big party.

766
00:54:06,037 --> 00:54:09,211
Great. Let's go
kill ourselves a witch!

767
00:54:45,447 --> 00:54:48,165
You'll die,
you'll die, you'll die!

768
00:54:49,325 --> 00:54:52,078
Did those crows just say
that we were gonna die?

769
00:54:52,245 --> 00:54:53,622
They did.

770
00:54:53,788 --> 00:54:55,255
Wizard?

771
00:55:05,464 --> 00:55:07,182
Come on.

772
00:55:19,019 --> 00:55:20,611
I'm scared.

773
00:55:23,439 --> 00:55:26,363
Think there are
ghosts out here?

774
00:55:26,525 --> 00:55:29,619
No. Of course not.

775
00:55:30,194 --> 00:55:32,822
Evil spirits maybe?

776
00:55:33,614 --> 00:55:36,367
The undead?

777
00:55:36,451 --> 00:55:37,997
The undead?

778
00:55:38,827 --> 00:55:40,795
Will you stop that?

779
00:55:54,633 --> 00:55:57,306
No. Get off!

780
00:55:57,469 --> 00:56:00,348
Something's got my tail.
Something's got my tail!

781
00:56:00,513 --> 00:56:01,685
Will you calm down?

782
00:56:06,560 --> 00:56:08,733
No! What is it?

783
00:56:09,313 --> 00:56:10,993
- Look out!
- I wanna go home!

784
00:56:11,148 --> 00:56:12,569
I wanna go home!

785
00:56:12,857 --> 00:56:14,359
- Hey!
- Hat!

786
00:56:14,484 --> 00:56:15,485
Thanks.

787
00:56:15,568 --> 00:56:16,820
Look out!

788
00:56:16,986 --> 00:56:18,329
- Come on.

789
00:56:20,864 --> 00:56:23,663
Hate the Dark Forest.
Hate the Dark Forest.

790
00:56:24,701 --> 00:56:27,500
Oh, my gosh. That was close.

791
00:56:28,914 --> 00:56:29,960
Where are we?

792
00:56:31,248 --> 00:56:32,875
This must be the place.

793
00:56:34,960 --> 00:56:37,679
So, how are you gonna
kill the Wicked Witch?

794
00:56:37,838 --> 00:56:40,761
All I need to do is
get her magic wand.

795
00:56:40,924 --> 00:56:43,302
Once I destroy that,
she's finished.

796
00:56:43,468 --> 00:56:44,685
Why don't you just use this?

797
00:56:44,844 --> 00:56:46,686
- It's got a knife!
- Where'd you get that?

798
00:56:46,845 --> 00:56:48,313
I'm made of china.

799
00:56:48,388 --> 00:56:50,686
I gotta protect myself somehow.

800
00:56:50,849 --> 00:56:52,192
Give me that.

801
00:56:52,351 --> 00:56:53,568
- Hey!

802
00:56:53,728 --> 00:56:56,356
- Honestly.
- "Honestly" yourself.

803
00:56:56,481 --> 00:56:57,858
Look.

804
00:57:01,278 --> 00:57:03,246
That must be her.

805
00:57:08,203 --> 00:57:09,705
Come on.

806
00:57:22,554 --> 00:57:23,897
She put down the wand.

807
00:57:24,055 --> 00:57:26,149
But how are we gonna get it?

808
00:57:26,808 --> 00:57:28,061
Hey!

809
00:57:29,311 --> 00:57:30,563
Now, listen up.

810
00:57:31,397 --> 00:57:33,275
Here's the plan.

811
00:57:33,984 --> 00:57:36,737
The Wicked Witch
is the triangle.

812
00:57:37,070 --> 00:57:40,166
Monkey, you're the X.
I'm the O.

813
00:57:40,324 --> 00:57:42,326
China Girl,
you're the squiggly line.

814
00:57:42,493 --> 00:57:45,088
I wanna be a heart.
Can I be a heart?

815
00:57:45,247 --> 00:57:48,000
All right, fine.
You're a heart.

816
00:57:48,167 --> 00:57:50,842
Okay, now, heart stays here

817
00:57:51,838 --> 00:57:54,933
as O makes his way over here.

818
00:57:55,091 --> 00:57:57,595
X counters thusly.

819
00:57:58,137 --> 00:57:59,138
Clear so far?

820
00:58:03,018 --> 00:58:04,019
Bless you.

821
00:58:04,102 --> 00:58:06,525
Good work. You just
sneezed away the plan.

822
00:58:06,814 --> 00:58:08,031
- Sorry.
- Never mind.

823
00:58:08,191 --> 00:58:09,943
Just go over there and make
some of your animal noises.

824
00:58:10,109 --> 00:58:11,749
I'll grab the wand
when she's not looking.

825
00:58:11,777 --> 00:58:13,655
Get out of here.

826
00:58:23,333 --> 00:58:25,928
Yes! Come on, come on.

827
00:58:38,476 --> 00:58:39,477
Oh, no!

828
00:58:51,032 --> 00:58:54,833
Moo!

829
00:58:55,162 --> 00:58:58,337
Moo!

830
00:58:58,541 --> 00:59:00,635
Moo!

831
00:59:00,835 --> 00:59:02,052
A cow?

832
00:59:02,337 --> 00:59:04,841
Moo!

833
00:59:08,345 --> 00:59:09,505
Come on. Come on.

834
00:59:10,180 --> 00:59:12,274
- Hurry!
- I got it!

835
00:59:12,349 --> 00:59:13,549
- Break it.
- Break it, Wizard.

836
00:59:13,642 --> 00:59:14,860
- All right.
- Break it!

837
00:59:15,019 --> 00:59:16,191
Did you say "Wizard"?

838
00:59:18,648 --> 00:59:19,696
No!

839
00:59:21,193 --> 00:59:22,820
Are you really the Wizard?

840
00:59:23,362 --> 00:59:24,989
Um... That's
a complicated question.

841
00:59:25,073 --> 00:59:26,620
I mean, what is a wizard? I...

842
00:59:29,369 --> 00:59:30,370
Um...

843
00:59:37,129 --> 00:59:38,972
Yes.

844
00:59:39,131 --> 00:59:40,474
I'm the Wizard.

845
00:59:40,632 --> 00:59:42,556
Then there's hope.

846
00:59:42,719 --> 00:59:44,016
What's going on?

847
00:59:44,178 --> 00:59:46,977
Not sure.
I sneezed the plan away.

848
00:59:47,140 --> 00:59:49,564
I have waited so long
to meet you.

849
00:59:49,727 --> 00:59:52,526
So, we've never met?

850
00:59:52,688 --> 00:59:54,532
Certainly not.

851
00:59:54,983 --> 00:59:56,701
I'd remember a thing like that.

852
00:59:56,860 --> 00:59:58,487
You've never been to Kansas?

853
00:59:58,653 --> 01:00:00,156
What is Kansas?

854
01:00:00,323 --> 01:00:02,246
Is that where you're from?

855
01:00:03,242 --> 01:00:06,713
My, you must have
traveled very far to get to the Land of Oz.

856
01:00:06,872 --> 01:00:08,499
I did.

857
01:00:09,166 --> 01:00:11,920
I'm Glinda the Good.
The Witch of the South.

858
01:00:12,545 --> 01:00:14,718
I thought Evanora
was the Good Witch.

859
01:00:14,881 --> 01:00:17,260
Evanora is
the true Wicked Witch.

860
01:00:17,551 --> 01:00:19,849
Conniving and as cruel
as they come.

861
01:00:20,012 --> 01:00:22,107
She's fooled most everyone,
including her own sister.

862
01:00:22,265 --> 01:00:25,394
She made everyone believe
that I poisoned my father

863
01:00:25,560 --> 01:00:27,734
- but it was her.
- Then,

864
01:00:27,855 --> 01:00:30,529
she's the one who
destroyed my village?

865
01:00:36,198 --> 01:00:38,873
I'm so sorry, child.

866
01:00:44,416 --> 01:00:45,884
Here's your wand.

867
01:00:46,043 --> 01:00:48,262
Sorry I mooed.

868
01:00:48,837 --> 01:00:52,593
And to think,
you almost killed Glinda for a bit of gold.

869
01:00:52,759 --> 01:00:53,760
A bit?

870
01:00:54,052 --> 01:00:56,101
There were
mountains of it, buddy.

871
01:00:56,263 --> 01:00:58,311
Not that I was going to do it.

872
01:00:58,474 --> 01:01:00,978
I wasn't really going
to break your wand.

873
01:01:02,562 --> 01:01:04,109
Follow me.

874
01:01:08,194 --> 01:01:09,195
Okay.

875
01:01:11,322 --> 01:01:12,540
No.

876
01:01:12,699 --> 01:01:15,953
No, no, no, no, no.
It cannot be.

877
01:01:16,328 --> 01:01:17,706
Curse you, Glinda.

878
01:01:17,872 --> 01:01:20,170
You should be dead.
I'll see you dead yet.

879
01:01:20,333 --> 01:01:22,883
Curse you and
your pretty little face.

880
01:01:23,045 --> 01:01:24,366
Sister.

881
01:01:24,422 --> 01:01:26,174
Sister, the Wizard is missing.

882
01:01:26,257 --> 01:01:28,727
I've looked everywhere,
but he's gone.

883
01:01:29,511 --> 01:01:31,354
What is it?

884
01:01:31,972 --> 01:01:33,690
Where is the Wizard?

885
01:01:34,015 --> 01:01:35,377
Where's the Wizard?

886
01:01:36,436 --> 01:01:37,437
With Glinda.

887
01:01:40,899 --> 01:01:42,116
Then it's happening.

888
01:01:44,653 --> 01:01:47,077
Oh, sister, he's fulfilling
the prophecy.

889
01:01:47,740 --> 01:01:51,041
He'll bring her darkness
to the light and peace to the land.

890
01:01:51,203 --> 01:01:56,300
Yes, I'm certain that's what
is happening. It must be.

891
01:02:10,350 --> 01:02:11,351
Where did you get that?

892
01:02:13,103 --> 01:02:14,230
This?

893
01:02:15,398 --> 01:02:16,490
Oh.

894
01:02:17,108 --> 01:02:19,953
It was a gift. From him.

895
01:02:23,491 --> 01:02:26,792
He came to my chambers
last night.

896
01:02:26,953 --> 01:02:29,877
Oh, how we danced.

897
01:02:30,040 --> 01:02:32,043
- For hours, it seemed.

898
01:02:33,878 --> 01:02:37,258
Oh, I can still feel his body
pressed against mine.

899
01:02:38,800 --> 01:02:40,598
Oh, sister, you were
right about him.

900
01:02:40,677 --> 01:02:41,850
He is the great Wizard.

901
01:02:42,013 --> 01:02:47,145
He must be, to make me
feel the way I feel.

902
01:02:55,612 --> 01:02:58,332
Oh, no.

903
01:02:58,658 --> 01:03:01,081
Not you, too, sister?

904
01:03:01,244 --> 01:03:04,419
He said we would
rule Oz together.

905
01:03:05,123 --> 01:03:07,467
He said I would be his queen.

906
01:03:07,626 --> 01:03:08,843
Did he?

907
01:03:19,181 --> 01:03:22,937
Are you quite sure it wasn't
you who said it to him?

908
01:03:43,711 --> 01:03:46,885
You fool!

909
01:04:06,654 --> 01:04:09,373
Serves you right.

910
01:04:10,617 --> 01:04:14,043
I want Glinda and that wizard
torn to shreds.

911
01:04:14,204 --> 01:04:18,176
Do not fail me a second time.

912
01:04:18,335 --> 01:04:21,384
Fly!

913
01:04:37,607 --> 01:04:42,034
On the day my father died,
we lost a kind and noble leader.

914
01:04:42,196 --> 01:04:45,827
And a dark shadow
was cast across this land.

915
01:04:45,992 --> 01:04:49,838
I've had to stand alone
against Evanora and watch

916
01:04:50,665 --> 01:04:53,919
as towns were destroyed,
children were orphaned

917
01:04:54,085 --> 01:04:56,509
and my heart was broken.

918
01:04:57,422 --> 01:05:01,724
I've been unable to protect
the good people of Oz by myself.

919
01:05:03,179 --> 01:05:07,276
With only faith in my father's
prophecy, I've waited.

920
01:05:07,935 --> 01:05:08,936
For you.

921
01:05:10,854 --> 01:05:15,782
Great Wizard from Kansas,
to come and set things right.

922
01:05:17,028 --> 01:05:18,029
Oh.

923
01:05:18,406 --> 01:05:20,374
So, that's the prophecy.

924
01:05:24,121 --> 01:05:25,122
Um...

925
01:05:25,580 --> 01:05:28,424
Well, you see,
when I agreed to be king,

926
01:05:28,583 --> 01:05:30,928
I didn't realize how
complicated all of this was.

927
01:05:31,087 --> 01:05:32,885
She knows.

928
01:05:33,840 --> 01:05:34,841
What?

929
01:05:34,924 --> 01:05:37,895
Evanora knows you know
the truth now. Look.

930
01:05:38,095 --> 01:05:39,142
Oh, no.

931
01:05:41,307 --> 01:05:43,105
Uh...

932
01:05:48,941 --> 01:05:49,942
What do we do?

933
01:05:50,109 --> 01:05:51,326
Wizard, now is the time.

934
01:05:51,485 --> 01:05:52,487
The time?

935
01:05:52,571 --> 01:05:53,993
Use your magic.

936
01:05:54,823 --> 01:05:55,870
Oh...

937
01:05:55,949 --> 01:05:59,045
My magic. Yes. Uh...

938
01:06:03,166 --> 01:06:05,010
I think we should run.

939
01:06:05,794 --> 01:06:06,920
Run?

940
01:06:07,087 --> 01:06:08,680
Yeah.

941
01:06:09,841 --> 01:06:10,967
You heard the Wizard. Run!

942
01:06:11,050 --> 01:06:12,051
Let's get out of here!

943
01:06:12,135 --> 01:06:13,136
Let's go!

944
01:06:18,267 --> 01:06:19,860
They're gaining on us!

945
01:06:20,103 --> 01:06:21,525
What are you doing?

946
01:06:22,105 --> 01:06:23,357
Is... Is that gonna stop them?

947
01:06:23,523 --> 01:06:25,116
I don't know.

948
01:06:36,455 --> 01:06:37,708
Nice work. We lost them.

949
01:06:37,874 --> 01:06:38,966
Phew! That was close.

950
01:06:39,125 --> 01:06:40,377
Yeah.

951
01:06:42,170 --> 01:06:44,515
Wait, I hear something.

952
01:06:53,350 --> 01:06:54,791
They're getting closer!

953
01:06:59,358 --> 01:07:01,156
Wait for me!

954
01:07:05,406 --> 01:07:07,204
Look out!

955
01:07:19,422 --> 01:07:20,924
Monkey!

956
01:07:22,093 --> 01:07:23,766
Little China Girl!

957
01:07:24,512 --> 01:07:27,106
Wizard! I'm over here!

958
01:07:29,517 --> 01:07:31,611
- Help! Catch me, please!
- Got you!

959
01:07:33,229 --> 01:07:34,947
- Are you all right?
- Yes.

960
01:07:35,273 --> 01:07:36,695
I'm okay, too.

961
01:07:38,234 --> 01:07:39,235
Just go!

962
01:07:39,360 --> 01:07:40,953
Great! A bunch of fog.

963
01:07:41,112 --> 01:07:43,535
This is her big idea
on how to save us?

964
01:07:43,698 --> 01:07:46,622
Well, it was the best I could
do under the circumstances.

965
01:07:47,285 --> 01:07:48,457
Uh...

966
01:07:54,375 --> 01:07:55,376
Oh, okay.

967
01:07:56,210 --> 01:07:57,382
Whoa!

968
01:07:57,795 --> 01:07:58,796
Catch her!

969
01:07:59,463 --> 01:08:01,431
Get me! Don't let go!

970
01:08:01,632 --> 01:08:03,134
Monkey, grab her!

971
01:08:03,301 --> 01:08:04,500
Don't let go!
Don't let go!

972
01:08:04,634 --> 01:08:06,432
Pull my tail. Ow!

973
01:08:06,595 --> 01:08:07,687
Not so hard.

974
01:08:09,806 --> 01:08:11,308
They're getting closer!

975
01:08:12,475 --> 01:08:13,601
What do we do?

976
01:08:13,768 --> 01:08:14,940
What do we do?

977
01:08:15,103 --> 01:08:17,197
Just do what I do.

978
01:08:18,982 --> 01:08:20,700
- Unless you've got something.
- Uh...

979
01:08:21,526 --> 01:08:23,449
No, you go.

980
01:08:26,990 --> 01:08:28,742
Wait. What are you doing?

981
01:08:30,535 --> 01:08:31,957
Wanda!

982
01:08:32,287 --> 01:08:33,288
Where are you going?

983
01:08:33,371 --> 01:08:34,998
She said to do what she did.

984
01:08:35,165 --> 01:08:37,714
Just because she jumped off
the cliff, you're gonna jump off the cliff?

985
01:08:37,876 --> 01:08:39,799
I have wings.

986
01:08:40,337 --> 01:08:42,339
- What about me?
- Come on!

987
01:08:47,010 --> 01:08:48,011
Um...

988
01:09:13,745 --> 01:09:15,042
Whee!

989
01:09:15,163 --> 01:09:17,382
Whoa! Oh! Oh!

990
01:09:20,168 --> 01:09:21,169
Whoa!

991
01:09:37,726 --> 01:09:39,194
Wow.

992
01:09:51,907 --> 01:09:52,999
Whoa!

993
01:09:57,037 --> 01:09:59,210
Oh! Oh, Oh, Oh!

994
01:10:06,171 --> 01:10:07,798
These things go
kind of fast, huh?

995
01:10:15,848 --> 01:10:18,101
Hey, is... Is that a wall?

996
01:10:18,267 --> 01:10:19,359
Of sorts.

997
01:10:19,518 --> 01:10:22,021
It repels our enemies
and protects us from harm.

998
01:10:22,813 --> 01:10:24,781
But we're
headed straight for it.

999
01:10:25,107 --> 01:10:26,950
Yes, we are.

1000
01:10:28,152 --> 01:10:31,873
And going very fast.
How do you, uh...

1001
01:10:32,990 --> 01:10:35,914
Does this thing
have any brakes? Uh...

1002
01:10:35,993 --> 01:10:38,837
I'm going too fast!
I'm gonna die!

1003
01:10:38,996 --> 01:10:40,839
You needn't worry, Wizard.

1004
01:10:40,998 --> 01:10:42,625
It's a magic wall.

1005
01:10:42,791 --> 01:10:45,794
And all good-hearted souls
get to pass through.

1006
01:10:46,794 --> 01:10:48,137
I'm gonna die!

1007
01:10:50,506 --> 01:10:52,554
Wanda!

1008
01:10:56,429 --> 01:10:57,430
Oh!

1009
01:11:09,650 --> 01:11:12,028
It's beautiful.

1010
01:11:26,876 --> 01:11:30,471
They've waited a long time
for you, Wizard.

1011
01:11:47,438 --> 01:11:49,941
All hail the great
and powerful Oz!

1012
01:11:50,108 --> 01:11:51,860
Hail!

1013
01:11:52,944 --> 01:11:53,991
Thank you!

1014
01:11:54,237 --> 01:11:55,989
Wow, you're a wonderful crowd.

1015
01:11:56,155 --> 01:11:59,375
You put the "merry" back in
"the merry Land of Oz."

1016
01:12:04,204 --> 01:12:05,831
Hi, what's your name?

1017
01:12:05,997 --> 01:12:08,170
- You're very beautiful.
- Oh, thank you.

1018
01:12:08,333 --> 01:12:11,712
Girls, listen,
I am not a toy. I am not a toy!

1019
01:12:11,878 --> 01:12:13,630
- Oz! Oz!

1020
01:12:14,047 --> 01:12:15,048
- Hello!

1021
01:12:15,799 --> 01:12:17,301
What? No fireworks?

1022
01:12:17,467 --> 01:12:19,595
What are fireworks?

1023
01:12:19,928 --> 01:12:21,396
Remind me to show you sometime.

1024
01:12:21,555 --> 01:12:25,401
Glinda, I didn't know
if you'd like these, or these.

1025
01:12:25,559 --> 01:12:28,358
They're both so beautiful,
I couldn't possibly decide.

1026
01:12:28,979 --> 01:12:30,231
We need your help, Wizard.

1027
01:12:30,814 --> 01:12:32,316
Please save us!

1028
01:12:32,482 --> 01:12:34,860
You know,
I should tell you, um...

1029
01:12:35,777 --> 01:12:39,998
I might not actually
be a wizard.

1030
01:12:40,157 --> 01:12:41,659
Yes, I know.

1031
01:12:41,825 --> 01:12:42,826
Oh.

1032
01:12:43,034 --> 01:12:45,537
At least, not any kind of wizard
we were expecting.

1033
01:12:46,121 --> 01:12:47,373
You could tell?

1034
01:12:47,539 --> 01:12:48,882
Yes.

1035
01:12:49,040 --> 01:12:51,919
I can also tell
you're weak, selfish,

1036
01:12:52,085 --> 01:12:55,214
slightly egotistical
and a fibber.

1037
01:12:55,380 --> 01:12:58,554
I see.
Anything you don't know about me?

1038
01:12:58,717 --> 01:13:01,186
Whether or not
you'll save my people.

1039
01:13:01,344 --> 01:13:03,938
No. I just told you
I'm not the Wizard.

1040
01:13:04,097 --> 01:13:06,270
But they don't know that.

1041
01:13:07,392 --> 01:13:11,192
If you can make them believe,
then you're wizard enough.

1042
01:13:12,355 --> 01:13:15,325
These are desperate times,
after all.

1043
01:13:16,735 --> 01:13:19,329
Can you make them believe?

1044
01:13:24,992 --> 01:13:28,792
Will I still get that gold?

1045
01:13:29,663 --> 01:13:30,835
Uh-huh.

1046
01:13:34,293 --> 01:13:36,967
Good people of Oz.

1047
01:13:37,421 --> 01:13:40,470
Your Wizard is here!

1048
01:14:01,695 --> 01:14:03,948
What's the matter, sister?

1049
01:14:05,658 --> 01:14:08,002
Look at how happy they are.

1050
01:14:08,160 --> 01:14:10,003
Do you think
she'll be his queen?

1051
01:14:10,162 --> 01:14:12,210
Well,
of course she'll be his queen.

1052
01:14:12,581 --> 01:14:14,379
- What did you expect?

1053
01:14:14,541 --> 01:14:16,464
You can't compete
with Glinda's charms.

1054
01:14:16,961 --> 01:14:18,008
No one can.

1055
01:14:20,214 --> 01:14:23,514
Oh, God. Sister, it hurts.

1056
01:14:23,676 --> 01:14:25,678
Such is a broken heart.

1057
01:14:25,844 --> 01:14:28,438
Your precious wizard
did that to you.

1058
01:14:29,223 --> 01:14:31,100
Make it stop.

1059
01:14:31,850 --> 01:14:33,523
Would you like me to?

1060
01:14:44,904 --> 01:14:48,249
One bite is all it takes.

1061
01:14:48,700 --> 01:14:52,796
One bite and your world
will change forever.

1062
01:14:53,413 --> 01:14:58,385
One bite and your heart
will become impenetrable.

1063
01:14:58,710 --> 01:15:02,556
One bite and you and I
will finally share the throne.

1064
01:15:02,880 --> 01:15:04,882
Unless you'd rather see
Oz and Glinda there.

1065
01:15:25,903 --> 01:15:28,747
You're the wicked one.
Not Glinda.

1066
01:15:30,783 --> 01:15:32,581
Sister, you lied to me.

1067
01:15:32,994 --> 01:15:35,122
It's nice, isn't it?

1068
01:15:35,288 --> 01:15:37,962
How clear everything becomes.

1069
01:15:50,094 --> 01:15:52,517
What is happening to me?

1070
01:15:52,680 --> 01:15:54,682
Oh, it's just your heart
withering away.

1071
01:15:55,808 --> 01:16:01,440
Fear not, Theodora, for soon you will
feel nothing at all except

1072
01:16:01,606 --> 01:16:05,109
beautiful wickedness.

1073
01:16:23,794 --> 01:16:24,841
Sister?

1074
01:16:45,982 --> 01:16:48,326
Oh, sister, you're hideous.

1075
01:16:49,986 --> 01:16:51,363
I can cast a simple enchantment

1076
01:16:51,530 --> 01:16:53,658
and have you looking
just the way you were before.

1077
01:16:53,824 --> 01:16:54,916
No!

1078
01:16:55,325 --> 01:16:57,669
This is who I am now.

1079
01:17:00,455 --> 01:17:02,708
I want him to see me like this.

1080
01:17:03,333 --> 01:17:07,179
I want him to know that he was the one
who made me this way.

1081
01:17:09,798 --> 01:17:11,675
Oh, dear.

1082
01:17:24,728 --> 01:17:27,948
It's imperative that you behave like
the great leader that they think you are.

1083
01:17:28,107 --> 01:17:31,702
Morale is essential if we have
any hope of defeating Evanora.

1084
01:17:31,986 --> 01:17:34,239
- And I assume you have a plan.
- No.

1085
01:17:35,448 --> 01:17:37,041
You have a plan.

1086
01:17:37,199 --> 01:17:40,203
You're going to lead us into battle
and take back the throne.

1087
01:17:42,121 --> 01:17:44,795
And do we have
an army to help do this?

1088
01:17:46,417 --> 01:17:47,543
Of sorts.

1089
01:17:48,711 --> 01:17:51,385
The Quadlings, Your Highness.

1090
01:17:53,549 --> 01:17:54,926
You're soldiers?

1091
01:17:55,092 --> 01:17:58,562
No, sir. Farmers, mostly.

1092
01:17:58,721 --> 01:17:59,722
Farmers?

1093
01:18:00,890 --> 01:18:01,982
But you can fight.

1094
01:18:02,141 --> 01:18:04,235
No, sir.
Many of us can hoe.

1095
01:18:04,560 --> 01:18:05,561
Oh, you can hoe.

1096
01:18:05,769 --> 01:18:07,988
- And I can work with iron.
- That's good.

1097
01:18:08,063 --> 01:18:09,531
- I bake bread.
- Yummy.

1098
01:18:09,607 --> 01:18:11,359
- I can sew.
- Not so helpful.

1099
01:18:11,442 --> 01:18:12,614
I can make a scarecrow.

1100
01:18:13,194 --> 01:18:14,195
Ah!

1101
01:18:14,278 --> 01:18:16,747
Well, that'll come in handy.

1102
01:18:16,906 --> 01:18:18,579
- It might.
- Hmm.

1103
01:18:18,949 --> 01:18:20,826
And these are the Tinkers.

1104
01:18:23,245 --> 01:18:24,497
Are you kidding me?

1105
01:18:24,663 --> 01:18:27,212
We're tougher
than we look, Wizard.

1106
01:18:29,502 --> 01:18:31,675
What they lack in stamina
the Tinkers make up for in ingenuity.

1107
01:18:31,837 --> 01:18:33,805
They can build anything.

1108
01:18:35,758 --> 01:18:37,601
And I'll tell you what else.

1109
01:18:37,760 --> 01:18:39,762
We can build anything.

1110
01:18:40,012 --> 01:18:41,104
Yeah, I got it.

1111
01:18:41,262 --> 01:18:44,562
And we're prepared
to storm the Emerald City.

1112
01:18:45,767 --> 01:18:48,111
If you don't keel over
on the way there.

1113
01:18:50,438 --> 01:18:51,439
Ow!

1114
01:18:52,190 --> 01:18:54,033
And, finally, the Munchkins.

1115
01:19:06,079 --> 01:19:08,002
Please tell me,
you gentlemen can fight.

1116
01:19:08,081 --> 01:19:09,082
No.

1117
01:19:09,249 --> 01:19:10,876
But we make pretty clothes.

1118
01:19:11,042 --> 01:19:12,589
Also, we sing.

1119
01:19:13,002 --> 01:19:14,595
Uh, no,
that won't be necessary.

1120
01:19:14,754 --> 01:19:17,849
I like it,
I think it's cute. I hope you like it.

Munchkins, stop!

1131
01:19:43,866 --> 01:19:46,369
- They do make beautiful clothes.
- All right.

1132
01:19:46,536 --> 01:19:48,834
Now, listen, Wanda.

1133
01:19:48,997 --> 01:19:50,465
Glinda.

1134
01:19:51,874 --> 01:19:54,172
Guys, um, take five.

1135
01:19:57,130 --> 01:20:02,135
Uh, Glinda, these are all
very lovely people.

1136
01:20:02,759 --> 01:20:06,013
But do you honestly believe
that they can kill a wicked witch

1137
01:20:06,096 --> 01:20:08,098
and an army of flying baboons?

1138
01:20:09,016 --> 01:20:11,394
I don't expect them
to kill anyone.

1139
01:20:11,518 --> 01:20:12,485
What do you mean?

1140
01:20:12,561 --> 01:20:15,064
I mean the good people of Oz
are forbidden to kill.

1141
01:20:15,230 --> 01:20:17,028
Forbidden to...

1142
01:20:23,614 --> 01:20:25,334
You want me to lead
an army that can't kill?

1143
01:20:26,033 --> 01:20:29,128
If this was easy,
we wouldn't need a wizard, would we?

1144
01:20:29,995 --> 01:20:31,918
Somethings wrong!

1145
01:20:32,289 --> 01:20:34,041
- Look!
- What is that?

1146
01:20:34,207 --> 01:20:37,131
- The wall!
- What's happening?

1147
01:20:37,419 --> 01:20:39,899
The Wicked Witch isn't
powerful enough to get through the wall.

1148
01:20:40,631 --> 01:20:42,632
It looks like she's managing.

1149
01:20:43,257 --> 01:20:45,601
Not by herself, she isn't.

1150
01:20:45,760 --> 01:20:47,136
What does that mean?
Is someone helping her?

1151
01:20:47,302 --> 01:20:48,554
Everyone, take cover!

1152
01:20:48,720 --> 01:20:50,721
Run quickly! Take cover!

1153
01:20:52,348 --> 01:20:54,691
Get the children to safety!
Run!

1154
01:20:55,558 --> 01:20:56,558
Glinda!

1155
01:21:54,767 --> 01:21:56,439
There's so much good here.

1156
01:21:57,477 --> 01:21:59,695
It sickens me.

1157
01:22:03,231 --> 01:22:04,198
Ah!

1158
01:22:04,273 --> 01:22:08,027
Still think your Wizard
can save you from the likes of me?

1159
01:22:11,487 --> 01:22:15,286
Speak up, or I will
tear out your tongue!

1160
01:22:15,448 --> 01:22:16,870
Now, who is that?

1161
01:22:18,117 --> 01:22:20,790
Don't you recognize me, Wizard?

1162
01:22:21,994 --> 01:22:23,712
Have I changed so much?

1163
01:22:24,746 --> 01:22:25,747
Theodora?

1164
01:22:26,998 --> 01:22:29,125
May I have this dance?

1165
01:22:30,418 --> 01:22:31,634
Huh?

1166
01:22:32,669 --> 01:22:33,966
Hey, hey!

1167
01:22:36,296 --> 01:22:38,468
I get it!
You're a little upset!

1168
01:22:44,594 --> 01:22:47,688
Theodora, stop.
You're hurting him.

1169
01:23:01,356 --> 01:23:04,325
Theodora, what happened to you?

1170
01:23:04,483 --> 01:23:05,905
You happened to me.

1171
01:23:12,656 --> 01:23:14,032
This isn't you.

1172
01:23:14,699 --> 01:23:18,077
It's your sister.
She's worked her magic on you.

1173
01:23:18,326 --> 01:23:20,498
I'd hoped you'd be able
to see through her.

1174
01:23:20,661 --> 01:23:23,756
Oh, Glinda, so naive.

1175
01:23:24,497 --> 01:23:27,545
Just like your father.

1176
01:23:27,708 --> 01:23:30,803
That's why it was so easy
for my sister to kill him.

1177
01:23:32,420 --> 01:23:37,175
She only killed a man,
not what he believed in.

1178
01:23:37,466 --> 01:23:39,934
Begone, Witch, before
the Wizard makes mush of you!

1179
01:23:43,636 --> 01:23:44,637
Oh.

1180
01:23:45,095 --> 01:23:47,189
How sweet.

1181
01:23:49,056 --> 01:23:51,024
You all believe in him.

1182
01:23:53,185 --> 01:23:54,937
Well, so did I, once.

1183
01:23:56,687 --> 01:23:59,155
And as for you

1184
01:23:59,314 --> 01:24:02,988
my pretty one.

1185
01:24:03,150 --> 01:24:06,699
When I return with
my sister and her army

1186
01:24:06,861 --> 01:24:08,989
the Yellow Brick Road
will be red with the blood

1187
01:24:09,155 --> 01:24:14,250
of every Tinker, farmer and
Munchkin in your kingdom.

1188
01:24:14,867 --> 01:24:17,210
You underestimate us, Theodora.

1189
01:24:18,995 --> 01:24:22,999
We are a strong
and united people.

1190
01:24:23,165 --> 01:24:26,213
And now the Wizard
is here to lead us.

1191
01:24:26,918 --> 01:24:29,716
And as for your Wizard,

1192
01:24:30,003 --> 01:24:33,381
he will be the first to die.

1193
01:24:33,547 --> 01:24:37,722
And you will all see that he
is nothing but a deceitful,

1194
01:24:38,217 --> 01:24:43,063
selfish and extremely
mortal man.

1195
01:24:44,222 --> 01:24:46,269
Give me that!

1196
01:24:48,058 --> 01:24:50,230
It was a broom that you wanted.

1197
01:24:51,185 --> 01:24:52,777
Wasn't it, Wizard?

1198
01:25:05,779 --> 01:25:07,280
It's all right.

1199
01:25:08,906 --> 01:25:10,031
It's all right!

1200
01:25:10,698 --> 01:25:13,917
She's gone now.
Don't be frightened.

1201
01:25:14,076 --> 01:25:16,078
Now that
the Wizard is with us...

1202
01:25:16,702 --> 01:25:18,079
Wizard?

1203
01:25:21,790 --> 01:25:23,292
Leaving?

1204
01:25:23,749 --> 01:25:24,921
But you promised to help us.

1205
01:25:25,084 --> 01:25:27,711
Yeah, well, that was
before I knew what we were up against.

1206
01:25:27,877 --> 01:25:29,971
An army and yet another
wicked witch?

1207
01:25:30,129 --> 01:25:33,223
This one bent on destroying
everyone, especially me?

1208
01:25:33,382 --> 01:25:34,724
We can defeat them.

1209
01:25:34,882 --> 01:25:36,634
There must be something.

1210
01:25:36,801 --> 01:25:38,222
Something we
haven't thought of.

1211
01:25:38,301 --> 01:25:39,541
Something that
we're not seeing.

1212
01:25:39,594 --> 01:25:40,766
Something we're
just on the verge of.

1213
01:25:40,929 --> 01:25:42,430
Glinda.

1214
01:25:42,596 --> 01:25:45,269
You need a real wizard.
Better yet, a general.

1215
01:25:45,431 --> 01:25:47,308
But you're all I have.

1216
01:25:50,769 --> 01:25:53,442
So, you're not the wizard
I was expecting.

1217
01:25:54,397 --> 01:25:56,740
So, you don't have the powers
I thought you'd have.

1218
01:25:57,941 --> 01:26:00,113
But you're here.

1219
01:26:00,276 --> 01:26:02,824
There must be a reason.

1220
01:26:02,986 --> 01:26:06,956
Maybe you're capable
of more than you know.

1221
01:26:09,782 --> 01:26:12,910
Glinda, I wish
I had the answer.

1222
01:26:13,785 --> 01:26:15,958
But I'm just a con man.

1223
01:26:17,162 --> 01:26:18,914
I'm a carnival magician.

1224
01:26:21,416 --> 01:26:24,635
I'm just not the man
you want me to be.

1225
01:26:26,461 --> 01:26:29,134
Someone needs to tuck me in.

1226
01:26:34,341 --> 01:26:36,014
Yes, of course.

1227
01:26:38,887 --> 01:26:40,355
Allow me.

1228
01:26:41,096 --> 01:26:43,019
My papa used to do it.

1229
01:26:47,101 --> 01:26:48,522
I see.

1230
01:26:49,102 --> 01:26:51,980
Perhaps you'd prefer
the Wizard, then?

1231
01:26:53,022 --> 01:26:55,149
Yes, please.

1232
01:27:11,368 --> 01:27:12,744
All right.

1233
01:27:13,077 --> 01:27:15,171
In you go.

1234
01:27:16,455 --> 01:27:17,957
- Here you are.
- Uh-uh.

1235
01:27:18,290 --> 01:27:19,632
Just a moment.

1236
01:27:22,543 --> 01:27:24,544
Bring forth the covers now.

1237
01:27:24,711 --> 01:27:26,054
Yes, ma'am.

1238
01:27:29,048 --> 01:27:30,549
Comfy?

1239
01:27:32,258 --> 01:27:33,554
All right. Goodnight.

1240
01:27:33,717 --> 01:27:35,344
Do you grant wishes?

1241
01:27:36,720 --> 01:27:37,811
Do I what?

1242
01:27:37,970 --> 01:27:39,517
Grant wishes.

1243
01:27:40,181 --> 01:27:42,057
The old wizard
could grant wishes.

1244
01:27:42,641 --> 01:27:43,642
Ah.

1245
01:27:43,725 --> 01:27:46,603
People would
travel to the Emerald City

1246
01:27:46,685 --> 01:27:48,527
and ask him for things.

1247
01:27:48,686 --> 01:27:52,155
And if they were
good and noble wishes,

1248
01:27:52,314 --> 01:27:53,531
he would grant them.

1249
01:27:53,690 --> 01:27:55,362
Is that right?

1250
01:27:55,524 --> 01:27:58,151
Do you know what I'd wish for?

1251
01:27:58,276 --> 01:28:00,199
Hmm. A pretty dress?

1252
01:28:01,570 --> 01:28:03,698
To have my family back.

1253
01:28:06,074 --> 01:28:07,917
I know.

1254
01:28:08,076 --> 01:28:09,497
I'm sorry.

1255
01:28:10,369 --> 01:28:12,370
I can't grant wishes.

1256
01:28:13,037 --> 01:28:15,256
I'm not that kind of wizard.

1257
01:28:16,915 --> 01:28:18,917
That's what I thought.

1258
01:28:20,250 --> 01:28:25,050
Um, you see, where I come
from there aren't any real wizards.

1259
01:28:26,380 --> 01:28:29,509
Although, there is one.

1260
01:28:31,384 --> 01:28:34,102
Thomas Alva Edison.

1261
01:28:34,260 --> 01:28:38,605
The Wizard of Menlo Park.
A truly great man.

1262
01:28:38,764 --> 01:28:41,892
- Did he grant wishes?
- No.

1263
01:28:42,058 --> 01:28:45,732
But he could look into
the future and make it real.

1264
01:28:45,894 --> 01:28:49,443
He created the electric light,
the phonograph.

1265
01:28:49,605 --> 01:28:53,234
He created a camera that
could take moving pictures.

1266
01:28:53,400 --> 01:28:54,776
Pictures that move?

1267
01:28:54,942 --> 01:28:56,740
Yeah. Can you imagine?

1268
01:28:56,902 --> 01:29:00,451
And all he had was a little
bit of wire and some glass.

1269
01:29:01,072 --> 01:29:05,371
With almost nothing,
he made the impossible real.

1270
01:29:05,533 --> 01:29:07,627
Is that the kind
of wizard you are?

1271
01:29:12,871 --> 01:29:15,919
It's the kind of wizard
I'd like to be.

1272
01:29:16,082 --> 01:29:19,756
Well, you are that kind.
I can tell.

1273
01:29:21,086 --> 01:29:26,136
I'd rather you grant wishes,
but that's a good wizard, too.

1274
01:29:28,299 --> 01:29:30,471
Goodnight, Wizard.

1275
01:29:37,472 --> 01:29:39,940
Glinda. I've got it.

1276
01:29:40,558 --> 01:29:41,525
What have you got?

1277
01:29:41,600 --> 01:29:43,772
I've got a way out
of this mess.

1278
01:29:46,438 --> 01:29:49,782
- What is this?
- A battle plan.

1279
01:29:53,776 --> 01:29:55,277
It's all in there.

1280
01:29:55,902 --> 01:29:58,279
Illusion, misdirect,
sleight of hand.

1281
01:29:59,071 --> 01:30:00,118
Look,

1282
01:30:00,281 --> 01:30:03,910
I know I'm not the wizard
that you were expecting

1283
01:30:04,075 --> 01:30:06,452
but I might just be
the wizard that you need.

1284
01:30:10,663 --> 01:30:12,505
You said you were
just a con man.

1285
01:30:12,914 --> 01:30:13,961
Precisely.

1286
01:30:14,124 --> 01:30:15,295
Nothing but a trickster?

1287
01:30:15,458 --> 01:30:16,459
Yes.

1288
01:30:16,625 --> 01:30:18,093
A terrible cheat?

1289
01:30:18,294 --> 01:30:19,590
The best there is.

1290
01:30:19,753 --> 01:30:22,972
The carnival magician's
going to put on a show.

1291
01:30:23,130 --> 01:30:25,848
I'll put on
the show of a lifetime.

1292
01:30:26,007 --> 01:30:29,306
The likes of which
the Land of Oz has never seen!

1293
01:30:30,469 --> 01:30:34,814
Magic, mystery,
prestidigitation!

1294
01:30:36,473 --> 01:30:39,397
It'll be my greatest trick yet.

1295
01:30:40,976 --> 01:30:42,899
Tinkers, gather around!

1296
01:30:43,062 --> 01:30:44,654
Quickly, now.

1297
01:30:44,812 --> 01:30:46,654
This is what you're
gonna build.

1298
01:30:46,813 --> 01:30:50,157
Where I come from,
this is called a praxinoscope.

1299
01:30:50,316 --> 01:30:52,159
Although, I've made
a few modifications.

1300
01:30:52,401 --> 01:30:55,279
It allows you to project
an image into space.

1301
01:30:55,445 --> 01:30:56,992
Impossible.

1302
01:30:57,154 --> 01:31:00,499
Nothing's impossible
if you put your mind to it.

1303
01:31:00,656 --> 01:31:02,078
- Bully.
- Bully!

1304
01:31:02,492 --> 01:31:04,994
These three roads
all lead to the Emerald City.

1305
01:31:05,160 --> 01:31:07,583
To the east are
the deadly poppy fields.

1306
01:31:07,662 --> 01:31:09,822
- We'll have to steer clear of them.
- Why is that?

1307
01:31:09,830 --> 01:31:11,672
One good whiff
and it's everlasting sleep.

1308
01:31:11,831 --> 01:31:15,505
And we're not exactly
a terrifying army when we're awake.

1309
01:31:15,667 --> 01:31:17,965
All right.
We'll steer clear.

1310
01:31:19,003 --> 01:31:20,846
Or maybe not.

1311
01:31:21,005 --> 01:31:23,632
In the conjuring business,
flash is always good.

1312
01:31:23,799 --> 01:31:25,516
Gives the audience
a little "wow".

1313
01:31:25,758 --> 01:31:29,807
You gentlemen will be
combining sulfur rock, nitrate of potash

1314
01:31:30,470 --> 01:31:34,269
and charcoal to create what is commonly
known as black powder.

1315
01:31:34,681 --> 01:31:36,478
Whoa!

1316
01:31:36,599 --> 01:31:38,943
Mr. Quimby,
we need 200 bales of hay

1317
01:31:39,018 --> 01:31:40,644
delivered to the main road
by noon.

1318
01:31:40,811 --> 01:31:43,780
Mr. Zim, have
the Quadling carts...

1319
01:31:55,279 --> 01:31:56,496
Looks good.

1320
01:32:32,347 --> 01:32:34,850
My very own Winkie Guards

1321
01:32:35,016 --> 01:32:39,565
soon you will be facing Glinda
and her army of weaklings.

1322
01:32:39,727 --> 01:32:42,946
And when they see
our towering might,

1323
01:32:43,105 --> 01:32:46,483
- they will run and flee for the hills and...
- No!

1324
01:32:46,649 --> 01:32:48,993
We shall not let them flee!

1325
01:32:49,152 --> 01:32:51,574
We shall show them no mercy!

1326
01:32:58,491 --> 01:33:00,663
Now, I've added this
adjustable lens to your design

1327
01:33:00,826 --> 01:33:02,749
along with a few other things.

1328
01:33:02,911 --> 01:33:04,162
Have a look.

1329
01:33:06,998 --> 01:33:10,842
Yes! Edison himself
would be proud.

1330
01:33:13,919 --> 01:33:17,138
Now, there's something else
I need you to do.

1331
01:33:17,297 --> 01:33:20,095
But I'd rather
you just keep it between us.

1332
01:33:20,257 --> 01:33:21,508
Yes?

1333
01:33:22,341 --> 01:33:25,184
Do you know how
to build a hot air balloon?

1334
01:33:34,642 --> 01:33:36,018
This is all very impressive

1335
01:33:36,185 --> 01:33:37,903
but you still haven't
told me how you plan

1336
01:33:37,978 --> 01:33:39,650
to get this thing
into the Emerald City.

1337
01:33:39,729 --> 01:33:41,731
Relax. I know someone.

1338
01:33:41,898 --> 01:33:43,570
What do you mean
you know someone?

1339
01:33:43,815 --> 01:33:45,613
Hello, Wizard.

1340
01:33:45,774 --> 01:33:49,573
Well, well, well.
If it isn't old Sourpuss.

1341
01:33:49,652 --> 01:33:51,199
My name is Knuck!

1342
01:33:51,362 --> 01:33:52,723
Now, you two be
nice to each other.

1343
01:33:52,988 --> 01:33:54,581
- Let's move it, Wizard.
- Can you give me a break?

1344
01:33:54,656 --> 01:33:56,158
I'll break your nose!

1345
01:33:57,033 --> 01:33:59,786
Guess I'm up.
Time to do what I do, right?

1346
01:34:00,035 --> 01:34:01,036
Cue the con man.

1347
01:34:01,119 --> 01:34:04,213
Would you stop? A con man
couldn't have done all this.

1348
01:34:04,455 --> 01:34:06,332
You're much more than that.

1349
01:34:06,956 --> 01:34:09,505
Well, then, it looks like
I've got you fooled, too.

1350
01:34:09,959 --> 01:34:12,962
The only person you've
got fooled is yourself.

1351
01:34:35,810 --> 01:34:37,733
For protection.

1352
01:34:38,812 --> 01:34:39,813
Not that you need it.

1353
01:34:52,822 --> 01:34:55,075
Great people of Oz.

1354
01:34:55,242 --> 01:34:58,120
Today we fight to free the land

1355
01:34:58,202 --> 01:35:00,249
from the villainy
of the Wicked Witches.

1356
01:35:01,537 --> 01:35:03,334
We are few

1357
01:35:03,497 --> 01:35:04,749
but we are mighty!

1358
01:35:05,958 --> 01:35:07,425
- Quadlings.

1359
01:35:07,625 --> 01:35:09,252
- Tinkers.
- Bully!

1360
01:35:09,418 --> 01:35:11,135
- Munchkins.

1361
01:35:11,628 --> 01:35:16,178
We face great odds,
but we are armed with our courage,

1362
01:35:16,340 --> 01:35:18,967
our hard work, and most of all,

1363
01:35:19,592 --> 01:35:22,219
our faith in one another.

1364
01:35:22,761 --> 01:35:26,481
We have nothing to fear
as long as we believe.

1365
01:35:27,847 --> 01:35:29,724
For when we do believe

1366
01:35:30,183 --> 01:35:32,025
anything is possible!

1367
01:35:34,311 --> 01:35:35,903
Onward!

1368
01:36:01,580 --> 01:36:02,581
Halt!

1369
01:36:04,582 --> 01:36:06,209
Good day there,
fellow Winkie guardsman.

1370
01:36:06,458 --> 01:36:07,539
What is your business here?

1371
01:36:07,626 --> 01:36:08,878
Supplies for battle.

1372
01:36:09,253 --> 01:36:11,596
We bring supplies for battle.

1373
01:36:13,714 --> 01:36:15,762
I was told of no such delivery.

1374
01:36:16,633 --> 01:36:17,929
Where are your
papers of transit?

1375
01:36:19,385 --> 01:36:22,103
Why this delay?
Do you not recognize me?

1376
01:36:22,262 --> 01:36:23,559
I'm Knuck, the City Herald.

1377
01:36:23,722 --> 01:36:24,973
Sir, I'm just trying
to do my...

1378
01:36:27,266 --> 01:36:28,767
- What I meant was...
- Hmm?

1379
01:36:29,976 --> 01:36:30,976
Let them pass!

1380
01:36:31,101 --> 01:36:33,274
Let them pass.

1381
01:37:31,644 --> 01:37:33,442
What's this?

1382
01:37:46,781 --> 01:37:49,499
They dare march on us?

1383
01:37:50,575 --> 01:37:52,542
- Tear them apart!
- Fly!

1384
01:38:42,904 --> 01:38:43,996
It's a trick.

1385
01:38:44,155 --> 01:38:45,201
Pull!

1386
01:38:52,828 --> 01:38:55,171
Retreat! Retreat!

1387
01:39:10,674 --> 01:39:12,518
Curse you!

1388
01:39:19,060 --> 01:39:21,530
Oh, it's not over yet.

1389
01:39:23,400 --> 01:39:27,782
The fog is lifting!
Quadlings, fall back.

1390
01:39:29,199 --> 01:39:30,417
Into the woods!

1391
01:39:30,577 --> 01:39:31,578
Watch out!

1392
01:39:34,916 --> 01:39:35,917
Ah!

1393
01:39:53,442 --> 01:39:55,491
Away with her.

1394
01:40:08,004 --> 01:40:09,176
- Oh!

1395
01:40:47,225 --> 01:40:48,569
- Herald.
- Great Wizard.

1396
01:40:48,727 --> 01:40:49,728
Who's this?

1397
01:40:49,812 --> 01:40:52,032
Emerald City underground.
Unload the carriage.

1398
01:40:52,190 --> 01:40:53,943
Yes, sir. To the rear.

1399
01:40:54,026 --> 01:40:55,027
Let's go!

1400
01:40:55,319 --> 01:40:56,412
Let's go.

1401
01:40:56,572 --> 01:40:57,664
You two, get the trolley.

1402
01:40:57,823 --> 01:40:59,576
Everything's ready.
All we need now is you.

1403
01:40:59,659 --> 01:41:00,661
Yeah, come on.

1404
01:41:00,744 --> 01:41:01,745
I just have to do
one thing first.

1405
01:41:01,829 --> 01:41:02,830
There's no time.

1406
01:41:02,997 --> 01:41:04,341
- Get this carriage in position.
- Yes, sir.

1407
01:41:04,499 --> 01:41:05,591
Hurry!

1408
01:41:05,751 --> 01:41:07,719
I told Glinda
you would do this.

1409
01:41:08,004 --> 01:41:10,178
She said I was wrong
about you. I guess I wasn't.

1410
01:41:10,257 --> 01:41:11,339
What are you talking about?

1411
01:41:11,342 --> 01:41:13,143
I'm talking about
that thing the Tinker built.

1412
01:41:13,261 --> 01:41:15,105
- The balloon.
- What balloon?

1413
01:41:17,767 --> 01:41:18,860
That's my cue.

1414
01:41:19,604 --> 01:41:21,027
All right, you guys.

1415
01:41:21,106 --> 01:41:23,405
Just remember,
stick to the plan.

1416
01:41:23,568 --> 01:41:24,785
Stick to the plan?

1417
01:41:24,944 --> 01:41:26,197
The plan was you.

1418
01:41:26,280 --> 01:41:27,577
We're supposed to stick to you.

1419
01:41:27,740 --> 01:41:29,914
You guys will do great.
So long.

1420
01:41:30,076 --> 01:41:31,875
Come back!
We can't do it alone.

1421
01:41:32,163 --> 01:41:34,212
- Wizard!
- Wizard, I don't know what to do!

1422
01:41:59,951 --> 01:42:02,922
Citizens of Emerald City.

1423
01:42:03,081 --> 01:42:07,589
Witness what happens
when you defy me.

1424
01:42:11,092 --> 01:42:15,474
Glinda did very well for
herself today, I'll admit.

1425
01:42:15,640 --> 01:42:16,938
Leave her alone!

1426
01:42:17,101 --> 01:42:18,478
Unchain her, you witch!

1427
01:42:18,644 --> 01:42:19,942
We know the truth.

1428
01:42:20,105 --> 01:42:21,265
You poisoned the king!

1429
01:42:21,356 --> 01:42:23,485
Guards!
Get them under control.

1430
01:42:23,651 --> 01:42:26,657
The citizens of Emerald City
will not tolerate this!

1431
01:42:26,823 --> 01:42:28,040
We will not!

1432
01:42:28,116 --> 01:42:29,118
Silence!

1433
01:42:31,245 --> 01:42:32,668
Silence!

1434
01:42:35,876 --> 01:42:36,969
Ooh...

1435
01:42:37,462 --> 01:42:39,591
What should I do now?

1436
01:42:39,841 --> 01:42:42,095
I'd get your sister
and fly out of here.

1437
01:42:42,261 --> 01:42:43,308
Really?

1438
01:42:43,470 --> 01:42:45,144
While you still can.

1439
01:42:45,390 --> 01:42:47,189
Well, I think I'm going to do
something quite different

1440
01:42:47,351 --> 01:42:49,354
and I'm going to do it,

1441
01:42:49,438 --> 01:42:53,865
ooh, very, very slowly, because

1442
01:42:55,612 --> 01:43:02,123
I just can't take the sight
of that pretty, pretty face.

1443
01:43:04,332 --> 01:43:06,256
Ooh, I'm going to
wipe out your light

1444
01:43:06,377 --> 01:43:09,302
until there is nothing
left but my darkness.

1445
01:43:10,967 --> 01:43:14,347
I have been waiting
for this for a long time.

1446
01:43:34,708 --> 01:43:36,711
Oh, no.

1447
01:43:38,047 --> 01:43:41,268
He said it was going to be
his greatest trick yet.

1448
01:43:41,426 --> 01:43:44,226
Did he tell you
the trick was on us?

1449
01:43:53,735 --> 01:43:56,080
How predictable.

1450
01:44:19,604 --> 01:44:23,110
I knew that buffoon of yours
couldn't be the Wizard.

1451
01:44:36,837 --> 01:44:39,341
Out of my way!

1452
01:44:47,143 --> 01:44:48,646
Give up, Glinda.

1453
01:44:48,812 --> 01:44:50,861
Why do you continue to resist?

1454
01:44:51,065 --> 01:44:53,239
Because I believe
in the Wizard.

1455
01:44:54,153 --> 01:44:55,655
So did I, once.

1456
01:44:56,156 --> 01:44:57,829
Behold!

1457
01:45:00,328 --> 01:45:01,672
Look!

1458
01:45:02,080 --> 01:45:04,175
Your Wizard!

1459
01:45:04,959 --> 01:45:06,758
Where is he going?

1460
01:45:06,921 --> 01:45:08,469
He's abandoning us.

1461
01:45:08,632 --> 01:45:10,509
How could he?

1462
01:45:21,816 --> 01:45:23,033
- No!

1463
01:45:32,414 --> 01:45:33,415
No!

1464
01:45:47,560 --> 01:45:48,652
Aw!

1465
01:45:49,063 --> 01:45:52,864
Not so great and powerful
after all.

1466
01:46:05,252 --> 01:46:07,881
You, there! Move back!

1467
01:46:24,779 --> 01:46:26,201
Hey.

1468
01:46:32,957 --> 01:46:33,958
Hello, monkey.

1469
01:46:34,125 --> 01:46:35,799
Oz!

1470
01:46:36,963 --> 01:46:38,886
- I thought you were dead.
- Shh.

1471
01:46:39,967 --> 01:46:41,264
You were crying pretty hard.

1472
01:46:41,552 --> 01:46:42,600
Was that for me?

1473
01:46:42,763 --> 01:46:45,563
Oh, no. Some of the smoke
got in my eyes.

1474
01:46:45,725 --> 01:46:47,148
On. Right.

1475
01:46:47,311 --> 01:46:50,316
Wow, you fooled everybody.

1476
01:46:50,398 --> 01:46:52,117
That was your
greatest trick yet.

1477
01:46:52,401 --> 01:46:53,903
That was just the opening act.

1478
01:46:54,070 --> 01:46:56,119
Let this be the final word.

1479
01:46:56,782 --> 01:46:58,956
Your prophecy is dead.

1480
01:46:59,577 --> 01:47:03,209
Like the king who spoke it
and the wizard who tried to fulfill it.

1481
01:47:03,374 --> 01:47:05,377
All dead.

1482
01:47:05,586 --> 01:47:06,587
It's showtime.

1483
01:47:06,670 --> 01:47:11,599
And they will be joined in
death by Glinda the Good.

1484
01:47:18,020 --> 01:47:19,488
Farewell.

1485
01:47:21,441 --> 01:47:24,036
Say hello to your daddy for me.

1486
01:47:33,250 --> 01:47:36,300
The dreams of
the people live on.

1487
01:48:03,208 --> 01:48:06,839
Fear me not, good people of Oz.

1488
01:48:07,005 --> 01:48:08,929
Fear me not.

1489
01:48:09,383 --> 01:48:11,386
For it is I,

1490
01:48:11,553 --> 01:48:13,977
the great and powerful

1491
01:48:14,140 --> 01:48:17,111
Wizard of Oz!

1492
01:48:17,269 --> 01:48:20,775
More tricks?
After everything.

1493
01:48:20,941 --> 01:48:22,909
How dare you defy us!

1494
01:48:23,069 --> 01:48:24,616
Dare?

1495
01:48:24,779 --> 01:48:27,329
How dare you, wicked sisters?

1496
01:48:27,491 --> 01:48:28,914
No one defies Oz!

1497
01:48:30,454 --> 01:48:32,457
Guards. Destroy him.

1498
01:48:32,624 --> 01:48:34,127
Forward!

1499
01:48:37,464 --> 01:48:38,808
Attack!

1500
01:48:55,781 --> 01:48:58,205
Guards! Come back here
this instant!

1501
01:49:02,999 --> 01:49:04,843
You thought you could kill me?

1502
01:49:05,253 --> 01:49:06,631
Me?

1503
01:49:06,797 --> 01:49:10,098
Thanks to you,
I have shed my mortal shell

1504
01:49:10,260 --> 01:49:14,187
and taken my
true ethereal form.

1505
01:49:16,102 --> 01:49:19,858
I'm now more
powerful than ever.

1506
01:49:20,983 --> 01:49:23,829
I'm invincible!

1507
01:49:23,988 --> 01:49:26,367
Do you still doubt me?

1508
01:49:27,325 --> 01:49:29,044
Doubt you?

1509
01:49:29,203 --> 01:49:31,627
I defy you!

1510
01:49:48,146 --> 01:49:49,899
Beautifully done, sister.

1511
01:49:50,065 --> 01:49:51,362
Thank you.

1512
01:49:52,402 --> 01:49:53,574
Hurry.

1513
01:49:54,071 --> 01:49:55,192
You're taking too much time.

1514
01:49:55,656 --> 01:49:57,000
Hold.

1515
01:49:59,662 --> 01:50:00,914
Hold.

1516
01:50:06,338 --> 01:50:07,716
They think they're winning.

1517
01:50:08,799 --> 01:50:09,801
Turn it back on.

1518
01:50:12,180 --> 01:50:14,103
What? Turn it back on!

1519
01:50:14,266 --> 01:50:15,438
Oh, we got a loose wire.

1520
01:50:15,601 --> 01:50:16,602
Oi!

1521
01:50:17,687 --> 01:50:18,768
Screw's stuck.

1522
01:50:18,772 --> 01:50:19,774
Hold on.

1523
01:50:21,025 --> 01:50:22,528
Use this.

1524
01:50:25,948 --> 01:50:27,451
- Got it.
- Right.

1525
01:50:32,792 --> 01:50:33,793
This can't be.

1526
01:50:35,462 --> 01:50:37,807
You cannot defeat me.

1527
01:50:38,633 --> 01:50:40,136
I'm immortal!

1528
01:50:40,302 --> 01:50:45,356
I am the great and powerful
Wizard of Oz!

1529
01:50:47,479 --> 01:50:50,780
Now witness and observe

1530
01:50:50,942 --> 01:50:54,368
as I unleash the stars!

1531
01:50:54,989 --> 01:50:57,288
Behold!

1532
01:51:12,889 --> 01:51:14,562
So, those are fireworks.

1533
01:51:22,360 --> 01:51:24,034
He is the Wizard.

1534
01:51:29,162 --> 01:51:30,756
We got Evanora.
She's on the run!

1535
01:51:31,039 --> 01:51:32,256
All right! We got one!

1536
01:51:32,374 --> 01:51:34,002
- Yeah!

1537
01:51:40,051 --> 01:51:41,895
Come back here, you coward!

1538
01:51:41,971 --> 01:51:42,973
Glinda.

1539
01:51:43,056 --> 01:51:44,023
It's you.

1540
01:51:44,099 --> 01:51:46,899
And you said that
I was the weak one!

1541
01:52:02,041 --> 01:52:03,242
I may not be able to kill you.

1542
01:52:03,251 --> 01:52:05,049
- Now.
- Okay.

1543
01:52:05,212 --> 01:52:08,138
But I can kill
the one you love.

1544
01:52:10,678 --> 01:52:11,679
Higher.

1545
01:52:11,763 --> 01:52:13,310
I'm trying.

1546
01:52:30,620 --> 01:52:32,294
Ready! Fire!

1547
01:52:39,382 --> 01:52:41,852
Begone, Wicked Witch!

1548
01:52:42,010 --> 01:52:43,353
Begone!

1549
01:52:43,512 --> 01:52:46,562
I hate you.

1550
01:52:52,357 --> 01:52:55,702
Begone, forevermore!

1551
01:52:57,321 --> 01:52:59,495
The Witch is gone!
The Witch is gone! Yes!

1552
01:52:59,866 --> 01:53:00,913
- Whoo-hoo!
- Bully, bully!

1553
01:53:01,076 --> 01:53:02,453
I knew we could do it.

1554
01:53:02,536 --> 01:53:03,538
Right.

1555
01:53:03,663 --> 01:53:06,668
Theodora, I know
your wickedness

1556
01:53:06,750 --> 01:53:08,343
is not your doing

1557
01:53:08,502 --> 01:53:09,846
and should you ever again

1558
01:53:09,921 --> 01:53:12,015
find the goodness within you

1559
01:53:12,507 --> 01:53:14,226
you are welcome to return.

1560
01:53:17,264 --> 01:53:19,107
Never!

1561
01:53:32,658 --> 01:53:34,627
Not so fast.

1562
01:53:37,205 --> 01:53:39,254
You and I aren't finished yet.

1563
01:53:41,169 --> 01:53:43,389
You have the throne, Glinda.

1564
01:53:44,089 --> 01:53:45,842
What more could you want?

1565
01:53:46,009 --> 01:53:48,432
You can't give me that.

1566
01:53:49,305 --> 01:53:52,401
You took what mattered
most to me.

1567
01:53:52,559 --> 01:53:54,311
My father.

1568
01:53:54,936 --> 01:53:58,487
I'll never again feel
the comfort of his kindness

1569
01:53:58,650 --> 01:54:00,904
but I'll settle for the
freedom of his people.

1570
01:54:01,153 --> 01:54:03,077
Of course, Glinda.

1571
01:54:03,823 --> 01:54:06,077
I think at the very least,
they deserve that.

1572
01:54:16,005 --> 01:54:17,428
What's the matter, Glinda?

1573
01:54:18,425 --> 01:54:20,269
Out of bubbles?

1574
01:54:21,096 --> 01:54:24,772
I don't need them.
Bubbles are just for show.

1575
01:55:46,538 --> 01:55:47,835
What have you done?

1576
01:56:20,582 --> 01:56:22,676
Look what you've done to me!

1577
01:56:24,087 --> 01:56:26,431
Now everyone will see you
as you truly are.

1578
01:56:29,260 --> 01:56:33,391
In the name of my father,
I banish you from the Emerald City

1579
01:56:33,933 --> 01:56:35,856
never to return.

1580
01:57:09,645 --> 01:57:11,443
Good people of Oz,

1581
01:57:11,606 --> 01:57:15,828
I have here a missive
from the great Wizard himself.

1582
01:57:16,946 --> 01:57:19,324
"With little more
than pluck and belief,

1583
01:57:19,491 --> 01:57:21,619
we made the
impossible happen."

1584
01:57:23,163 --> 01:57:26,589
"As your Wizard,
I hereby decree

1585
01:57:26,751 --> 01:57:29,345
the Land of Oz
will forever be free."

1586
01:57:49,696 --> 01:57:51,370
Okay.

1587
01:57:51,658 --> 01:57:53,205
Close the curtains, please.

1588
01:57:53,368 --> 01:57:55,337
I'm trying.

1589
01:57:55,496 --> 01:57:57,089
All right.

1590
01:57:58,708 --> 01:58:00,551
Let's give it a try.

1591
01:58:01,544 --> 01:58:03,013
- Is it on?

1592
01:58:04,048 --> 01:58:05,049
Is this thing working?

1593
01:58:05,174 --> 01:58:07,052
It's Wonderful.

1594
01:58:07,552 --> 01:58:08,896
Well.

1595
01:58:09,973 --> 01:58:13,228
If it isn't the most
beautiful witch in all of Oz.

1596
01:58:13,894 --> 01:58:15,897
Hi, Glinda.

1597
01:58:17,732 --> 01:58:18,904
Hello, Wizard.

1598
01:58:21,487 --> 01:58:23,161
Well done, Tinker.

1599
01:58:23,240 --> 01:58:25,038
Your machine works beautifully.

1600
01:58:25,242 --> 01:58:27,245
That's just workmanship.

1601
01:58:27,912 --> 01:58:30,883
What you displayed
was real courage.

1602
01:58:31,041 --> 01:58:33,716
Your father would have been
more than proud.

1603
01:58:33,878 --> 01:58:37,053
He would have marveled
at the woman you've become.

1604
01:58:39,427 --> 01:58:41,271
Zim Zallah Bim!

1605
01:58:41,680 --> 01:58:43,774
Excellent work, everyone.

1606
01:58:43,933 --> 01:58:46,527
Now we're ready in case anyone

1607
01:58:46,602 --> 01:58:48,776
wants to speak with the Wizard.

1608
01:58:49,189 --> 01:58:50,566
Now, remember,

1609
01:58:50,733 --> 01:58:52,736
Oscar Diggs died

1610
01:58:52,819 --> 01:58:55,323
so that the
Wizard of Oz could live.

1611
01:58:55,489 --> 01:58:59,290
When those witches come back,
and they will come back,

1612
01:58:59,453 --> 01:59:02,424
we're going to need
everyone to believe.

1613
01:59:02,582 --> 01:59:04,459
Your secret's safe with us.

1614
01:59:04,625 --> 01:59:05,843
Good.

1615
01:59:06,128 --> 01:59:09,429
And now it's time
for some gifts.

1616
01:59:09,591 --> 01:59:10,558
Gifts?

1617
01:59:10,633 --> 01:59:12,181
- Gifts?

1618
01:59:12,261 --> 01:59:14,480
Knuck, not now.

1619
01:59:15,599 --> 01:59:16,771
What kind of gifts?

1620
01:59:16,933 --> 01:59:18,685
Well, you know
I can't grant wishes,

1621
01:59:18,810 --> 01:59:21,155
so this will have to do.

1622
01:59:21,606 --> 01:59:24,201
First, the Master Tinker.

1623
01:59:24,359 --> 01:59:28,331
To the man who can
make anything, my lucky

1624
01:59:29,449 --> 01:59:30,542
thingamajig.

1625
01:59:30,993 --> 01:59:33,292
May it assist you
in the reconstruction

1626
01:59:33,371 --> 01:59:34,714
of the Emerald City.

1627
01:59:34,873 --> 01:59:37,169
I will cherish this forever.

1628
01:59:37,791 --> 01:59:39,666
Thank you for your faith in me.

1629
01:59:40,957 --> 01:59:43,834
And now for Sourpuss.

1630
01:59:44,249 --> 01:59:45,670
My name is Knuck!

1631
01:59:45,833 --> 01:59:48,459
Sourpuss, I grant you something

1632
01:59:48,542 --> 01:59:49,838
you are in need of most.

1633
01:59:50,210 --> 01:59:52,256
Something that,
where I come from

1634
01:59:52,335 --> 01:59:53,960
can turn the saddest day

1635
01:59:54,335 --> 01:59:57,132
into a happy one.

1636
02:00:02,212 --> 02:00:04,212
- I don't want that.
- It is yours.

1637
02:00:04,378 --> 02:00:06,799
- Take it back.
- I cannot.

1638
02:00:11,546 --> 02:00:12,637
Knuck,

1639
02:00:13,297 --> 02:00:14,673
you look nice with a smile.

1640
02:00:16,339 --> 02:00:18,215
You do look nice.

1641
02:00:18,672 --> 02:00:20,514
Thank you.

1642
02:00:22,216 --> 02:00:25,558
Finley, you stood by my side

1643
02:00:25,716 --> 02:00:29,683
when any monkey
in his right mind would have flown away.

1644
02:00:30,467 --> 02:00:33,513
To you, I give something
that I've never given to anyone.

1645
02:00:41,719 --> 02:00:43,890
My friendship.

1646
02:00:46,011 --> 02:00:49,353
Now you're my partner.
You're my friend.

1647
02:00:51,179 --> 02:00:53,555
That's all
I ever really wanted.

1648
02:00:56,514 --> 02:00:57,730
My turn, my turn.

1649
02:00:57,847 --> 02:00:59,063
Come here.

1650
02:01:02,139 --> 02:01:06,732
I'm afraid I can't give
you what I know you want most of all.

1651
02:01:08,682 --> 02:01:11,354
All I can offer you is this.

1652
02:01:14,725 --> 02:01:16,226
It's us.

1653
02:01:18,351 --> 02:01:20,351
I know it's not the family
that you had in mind.

1654
02:01:20,518 --> 02:01:21,860
It's perfect.

1655
02:01:25,852 --> 02:01:27,398
Thank you.

1656
02:01:38,438 --> 02:01:40,438
I wonder what you're gonna get.

1657
02:01:40,605 --> 02:01:42,947
Oh, I don't need
anything, child.

1658
02:01:43,106 --> 02:01:45,698
You better have
something for Glinda.

1659
02:01:45,856 --> 02:01:47,356
But of course.

1660
02:01:48,689 --> 02:01:51,190
I've saved the best for last.

1661
02:01:54,024 --> 02:01:55,696
For you.

1662
02:01:55,857 --> 02:02:00,234
A sight envied by all
and seen by none.

1663
02:02:00,400 --> 02:02:01,400
You'll be astounded

1664
02:02:01,484 --> 02:02:05,031
by what you find
behind the curtain.

1665
02:02:09,568 --> 02:02:11,785
Oh, my.

1666
02:02:11,985 --> 02:02:13,611
It's very tight in here.

1667
02:02:13,778 --> 02:02:15,404
It's nice, isn't it?

1668
02:02:16,778 --> 02:02:18,199
I know what
you're up to, Wizard.

1669
02:02:18,362 --> 02:02:21,455
What? I'm just
giving you a tour.

1670
02:02:21,946 --> 02:02:24,367
And I want to thank you.

1671
02:02:24,863 --> 02:02:27,114
For opening my eyes.

1672
02:02:27,280 --> 02:02:29,030
And what do you see?

1673
02:02:32,697 --> 02:02:35,119
That I have everything
I ever wanted.

1674
02:02:39,366 --> 02:02:42,742
For the record, I knew
you had it in you all along.

1675
02:02:44,367 --> 02:02:45,868
Greatness?

1676
02:02:46,118 --> 02:02:48,868
No. Better than that.

1677
02:02:49,535 --> 02:02:50,786
Goodness.

1678
02:03:11,122 --> 02:03:12,589
