1
00:00:58,375 --> 00:01:00,708
Avast, you hornswoggler.

2
00:01:00,791 --> 00:01:05,375
Avast yourself.
I'll run you through.

3
00:01:05,458 --> 00:01:07,375
I'll tear you limb from limb.

4
00:01:17,458 --> 00:01:18,458
Hey.

5
00:01:23,333 --> 00:01:25,750
Your time is running out, Peter Pan.

6
00:01:25,833 --> 00:01:28,125
Peter Pan
doesn't care about time.

7
00:01:28,208 --> 00:01:30,208
Watch out for the crocodile.

8
00:01:30,916 --> 00:01:32,708
You watch out for the crocodile.

9
00:01:32,791 --> 00:01:36,416
And, Wendy, please don't wait
to the last minute to pack.

10
00:01:36,500 --> 00:01:37,500
I won't, Mother.

11
00:01:37,583 --> 00:01:40,666
-The train is at 8 o'clock sharp tomorrow.
-Mother, I heard you.

12
00:01:40,750 --> 00:01:41,791
I'll be ready.

13
00:01:41,875 --> 00:01:44,750
Out of the way, Mother.
Where's that treasure?

14
00:01:44,833 --> 00:01:47,000
Where is it? Aha!

15
00:01:47,083 --> 00:01:48,583
No, give it back!

16
00:01:49,541 --> 00:01:50,958
John, give it back.

17
00:01:52,916 --> 00:01:54,125
I've got it!

18
00:01:57,333 --> 00:01:58,375
I've got the treasure.

19
00:01:58,458 --> 00:01:59,875
I've got the treasure.

20
00:01:59,958 --> 00:02:00,958
I've got the treasure.

21
00:02:07,041 --> 00:02:08,041
Got you.

22
00:02:10,916 --> 00:02:11,916
Where is it?

23
00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:16,416
Captain Hook,
I'm getting a little tired.

24
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:17,750
Maybe we can take a break?

25
00:02:17,833 --> 00:02:21,041
Are you forfeiting?
Are you giving up?

26
00:02:39,791 --> 00:02:44,125
I've got you cornered, Peter.
Your Lost Boys are nowhere to be seen.

27
00:02:44,208 --> 00:02:46,083
No one will save you now!

28
00:02:49,083 --> 00:02:52,333
You're not forgetting about me, are you?
Michael, give me your treasure.

29
00:02:53,583 --> 00:02:55,000
Now leave Hook to me.

30
00:02:56,208 --> 00:02:59,458
Make way, Captain, lest I run you through!

31
00:03:00,833 --> 00:03:02,458
Go, Wendy!

32
00:03:03,916 --> 00:03:05,083
Come on, Wendy.

33
00:03:06,291 --> 00:03:07,291
Go, Wendy.

34
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,250
Don't hurt him!

35
00:03:11,916 --> 00:03:13,375
- You giving up, Captain?
- No.

36
00:03:14,583 --> 00:03:16,333
No, you're just...

37
00:03:20,750 --> 00:03:21,875
What was that?

38
00:03:27,833 --> 00:03:28,875
Not again.

39
00:03:31,333 --> 00:03:32,958
Who's responsible for this?

40
00:03:35,083 --> 00:03:37,333
-Wendy?
-John, you tattletale!

41
00:03:37,416 --> 00:03:39,500
-I didn't say anything.
-It wasn't my fault!

42
00:03:39,583 --> 00:03:41,291
-It was their silly game!
-Now, now.

43
00:03:41,375 --> 00:03:43,708
-And they started it, it wasn't me!
-Enough!

44
00:03:43,791 --> 00:03:44,791
Sword.

45
00:03:47,250 --> 00:03:48,875
Sword, hats.

46
00:03:52,958 --> 00:03:54,083
Nana.

47
00:03:54,166 --> 00:03:56,333
Father, can't she just stay
for a little while?

48
00:03:56,416 --> 00:03:57,416
No, she cannot.

49
00:03:58,541 --> 00:04:02,291
Honestly, Wendy, is this how you want
to spend your last night at home?

50
00:04:02,375 --> 00:04:04,875
-It was just a bit of fun.
-Exactly.

51
00:04:05,625 --> 00:04:10,208
You are too old for this
to be the type of fun that you are having.

52
00:04:13,208 --> 00:04:15,000
Nana. Come on.

53
00:04:19,291 --> 00:04:22,125
Wendy, why did you say that?

54
00:04:22,833 --> 00:04:24,500
Why did you say it was our fault?

55
00:04:24,583 --> 00:04:28,000
You're a pirate, aren't you?
It's every man for himself.

56
00:04:45,208 --> 00:04:46,416
They suit you, Wendy.

57
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:53,791
You should take them with you.

58
00:04:54,583 --> 00:04:55,583
I'd rather not.

59
00:05:00,916 --> 00:05:02,958
Come along, boys, into bed.

60
00:05:08,166 --> 00:05:10,583
-It wasn't my fault.
-I know, John.

61
00:05:13,125 --> 00:05:16,416
Mother, why does Captain Hook
hate Peter Pan?

62
00:05:17,333 --> 00:05:21,583
That's a very good question,
one that we will have to ponder,

63
00:05:22,458 --> 00:05:23,666
tomorrow.

64
00:05:24,958 --> 00:05:26,083
Wendy.

65
00:05:26,666 --> 00:05:27,666
May I come in?

66
00:05:31,625 --> 00:05:35,000
You really must set a better example
for your brothers.

67
00:05:35,791 --> 00:05:37,708
They look up to you so much.

68
00:05:37,791 --> 00:05:39,500
That's what they have you for.

69
00:05:39,583 --> 00:05:41,750
They need me to be their mother

70
00:05:41,833 --> 00:05:43,708
and your father to be their father.

71
00:05:43,791 --> 00:05:46,625
But they need you to be their big sister.

72
00:05:47,958 --> 00:05:50,375
You give them something
that neither of us can.

73
00:05:51,166 --> 00:05:54,500
They will follow your lead,
so you must be a good leader.

74
00:05:55,125 --> 00:05:57,958
How am I supposed to do that
if I'm off at boarding school, Mother?

75
00:06:00,250 --> 00:06:02,333
By going with your head held high

76
00:06:03,083 --> 00:06:04,166
to start with.

77
00:06:05,125 --> 00:06:10,125
If a young lady is lucky enough,
at a certain age, she goes off to school.

78
00:06:10,791 --> 00:06:13,041
To get ready for the life ahead of her.

79
00:06:13,125 --> 00:06:15,291
What if I don't want that life?

80
00:06:15,833 --> 00:06:17,958
It's what I did when I was your age.

81
00:06:18,041 --> 00:06:20,041
What if I don't want your life?

82
00:06:31,083 --> 00:06:33,833
What is it that you're afraid of, my love?

83
00:06:34,958 --> 00:06:36,958
I want things to stay the way they are.

84
00:06:38,291 --> 00:06:39,500
The way they are?

85
00:06:41,041 --> 00:06:44,541
Wendy, look, you scarcely fit in your bed.

86
00:06:46,875 --> 00:06:48,083
You're growing up.

87
00:06:49,875 --> 00:06:51,541
Perhaps, I don't want to grow up.

88
00:06:54,833 --> 00:06:56,541
You can't stop time, Wendy.

89
00:06:57,500 --> 00:06:59,916
It'll march on whether you like it or not.

90
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,625
Just imagine all the things
you would miss out on,

91
00:07:04,791 --> 00:07:06,416
if you didn't see where it took you.

92
00:07:08,041 --> 00:07:10,458
And all the things the world would miss

93
00:07:11,875 --> 00:07:13,750
if you weren't there to do them.

94
00:07:19,375 --> 00:07:24,458
It's time to drift away, my loves

95
00:07:25,375 --> 00:07:31,791
And dream of cooing turtle doves

96
00:07:32,625 --> 00:07:38,541
For when I turn to switch the light

97
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:45,625
I know you'll grow up overnight

98
00:07:47,416 --> 00:07:53,166
Fly off into the cloudless skies

99
00:07:53,958 --> 00:08:00,500
Where twinkling stars will fill your eyes

100
00:08:01,583 --> 00:08:08,583
I'll miss you dearly
My brave little ones

101
00:08:10,833 --> 00:08:17,833
All grown up now in the morning sun

102
00:09:51,541 --> 00:09:53,250
Gotcha!

103
00:09:55,125 --> 00:09:57,125
I can't... What was happening?

104
00:09:58,708 --> 00:09:59,958
Was I dreaming?

105
00:10:00,041 --> 00:10:01,708
You were flying.

106
00:10:02,250 --> 00:10:03,250
How?

107
00:10:03,791 --> 00:10:05,250
A little bug did it.

108
00:10:10,375 --> 00:10:11,583
I don't think that's a bug.

109
00:10:13,041 --> 00:10:14,916
Well, it's a... It's a...

110
00:10:16,708 --> 00:10:18,291
She is a fairy.

111
00:10:19,333 --> 00:10:21,041
And if I know one thing about fairies,

112
00:10:21,125 --> 00:10:23,125
it's they don't take kindly
to being called bugs.

113
00:10:24,458 --> 00:10:26,750
- Are you...
- Peter Pan?

114
00:10:27,916 --> 00:10:29,833
Were you expecting someone else?

115
00:10:29,916 --> 00:10:32,416
We weren't expecting anyone at all.

116
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:34,083
They always act so surprised.

117
00:10:34,166 --> 00:10:35,833
I always envisioned you as being...

118
00:10:35,916 --> 00:10:37,708
-Taller?
-No, smaller actually.

119
00:10:40,833 --> 00:10:43,916
Oh, no, I'm sorry,
that's not what I meant.

120
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:48,416
I'm... Well... I... How are you real?

121
00:10:49,041 --> 00:10:50,750
I thought you were just a bedtime story.

122
00:10:50,833 --> 00:10:51,833
Why can't I be both?

123
00:10:53,625 --> 00:10:55,541
I like hearing stories about myself.

124
00:10:55,625 --> 00:10:57,833
And your mother's very good
at telling them.

125
00:10:57,916 --> 00:10:59,125
Now, let's see here.

126
00:10:59,208 --> 00:11:01,708
Excuse me, you can't just
go through all our stuff.

127
00:11:01,791 --> 00:11:03,000
Where are you hiding?

128
00:11:06,166 --> 00:11:07,750
Oh please, be careful.

129
00:11:07,833 --> 00:11:09,333
This is very delicate.

130
00:11:09,416 --> 00:11:11,000
What are you doing here?

131
00:11:11,083 --> 00:11:13,208
One, we've to get you out of here.

132
00:11:13,291 --> 00:11:14,291
And, two...

133
00:11:20,083 --> 00:11:21,083
My shadow.

134
00:11:21,166 --> 00:11:22,708
Your shadow?

135
00:11:22,791 --> 00:11:24,750
It's trying to get away,
and I've only got one.

136
00:11:25,291 --> 00:11:27,500
You're making this harder
than it has to be.

137
00:11:28,166 --> 00:11:29,166
Oh.

138
00:11:35,958 --> 00:11:36,958
There you are.

139
00:11:46,875 --> 00:11:47,875
Oh.

140
00:11:49,041 --> 00:11:50,041
Got it.

141
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,500
Lights out, shadow.

142
00:11:55,291 --> 00:11:56,875
Get it, Peter, get it.

143
00:12:00,250 --> 00:12:02,041
Oh, almost got it!

144
00:12:03,458 --> 00:12:05,291
There it is.

145
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,208
Your hat! I've got your hat!

146
00:12:10,125 --> 00:12:11,125
Go, go, go!

147
00:12:12,375 --> 00:12:13,375
Ha! Got you!

148
00:12:14,750 --> 00:12:17,458
When will you learn you can't get
anywhere without me, old friend.

149
00:12:18,458 --> 00:12:20,083
No, that time doesn't count.

150
00:12:28,333 --> 00:12:30,416
- Hold still.
- Maybe I could help you with that.

151
00:12:33,125 --> 00:12:34,875
Here. Let me see.

152
00:12:41,166 --> 00:12:43,583
It's okay, Tink. Wendy wouldn't hurt me.

153
00:12:45,750 --> 00:12:48,208
-Can't she speak?
-Of course, she can.

154
00:12:48,291 --> 00:12:50,166
You just haven't learnt to hear her right.

155
00:12:52,083 --> 00:12:54,166
Well, you're very small, Tinker Bell.

156
00:12:56,791 --> 00:12:59,666
-What's she saying?
-She says "All fairies are small.

157
00:12:59,750 --> 00:13:02,041
-"That's what makes them fairies."
-Oh.

158
00:13:07,333 --> 00:13:09,250
How'd you know my name, Peter Pan?

159
00:13:10,333 --> 00:13:11,708
I heard your mother call you.

160
00:13:11,791 --> 00:13:14,166
-"Wendy, time to wake up," she says.
-Time to wake up.

161
00:13:14,250 --> 00:13:16,416
-"Wendy, time for school."
-Wendy, time for school.

162
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:18,125
-"Wendy, bedtime."
-Wendy, bedtime.

163
00:13:18,791 --> 00:13:20,416
But you never want to go.

164
00:13:21,916 --> 00:13:23,416
You've been watching me?

165
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:25,250
-Sometimes.
-Why?

166
00:13:25,333 --> 00:13:27,208
Because I've been waiting
for you to say it.

167
00:13:27,291 --> 00:13:30,416
-Say what?
-Same thing I said, once upon a time.

168
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:31,791
I don't want to grow... Ow!

169
00:13:31,875 --> 00:13:33,875
-Ow! Ow!
-I was only...

170
00:13:33,958 --> 00:13:36,000
You stabbed me.
You stabbed me in the heart.

171
00:13:36,083 --> 00:13:37,625
Your heart is in your foot?

172
00:13:38,416 --> 00:13:39,416
Isn't yours?

173
00:13:39,500 --> 00:13:43,875
When Mr. Bear gets hurt,
Mama gives him a kiss to make it better.

174
00:13:43,958 --> 00:13:45,750
What's a kiss?

175
00:13:45,833 --> 00:13:47,291
You don't know what a kiss is?

176
00:13:47,375 --> 00:13:49,541
No, but I think I need one.

177
00:13:51,250 --> 00:13:52,458
Well, I...

178
00:13:53,541 --> 00:13:54,541
No.

179
00:13:55,416 --> 00:13:56,416
Um...

180
00:14:02,666 --> 00:14:03,750
This is a kiss.

181
00:14:10,416 --> 00:14:13,125
I like it. I like it very much.

182
00:14:13,791 --> 00:14:14,791
Now, do you feel better?

183
00:14:15,625 --> 00:14:17,041
Yes. Good as new.

184
00:14:17,125 --> 00:14:19,250
What's she saying?

185
00:14:19,916 --> 00:14:22,291
- That it's high time we go.
- Go where?

186
00:14:22,375 --> 00:14:26,208
To one place in the entire universe
where you can really be yourself.

187
00:14:26,291 --> 00:14:30,333
Where there are no rules, no schools,
no bedtimes, no mothers and fathers,

188
00:14:30,416 --> 00:14:32,208
-and most of all...
-No growing up.

189
00:14:32,291 --> 00:14:33,916
That most of all.

190
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,083
Oh, you are you talking about Neverland?

191
00:14:36,166 --> 00:14:37,541
Surely, we couldn't there though?

192
00:14:37,625 --> 00:14:40,375
-Of course, you could.
-But how do you get there?

193
00:14:40,458 --> 00:14:42,458
That's... the fun part.

194
00:14:52,666 --> 00:14:55,083
This suddenly seems like a terrible idea.

195
00:14:59,916 --> 00:15:01,916
I've always dreamed of flying.

196
00:15:02,833 --> 00:15:05,041
It's the easiest thing in the world.

197
00:15:05,125 --> 00:15:08,250
All you have to do, is fill your head
with happy thoughts.

198
00:15:08,333 --> 00:15:09,333
That's it?

199
00:15:11,125 --> 00:15:13,791
Oh, right. And a little pixie dust.

200
00:15:18,375 --> 00:15:19,708
What is it?

201
00:15:20,416 --> 00:15:21,416
What are you saying?

202
00:15:28,083 --> 00:15:29,916
You want me to close my eyes?

203
00:15:31,583 --> 00:15:32,583
All right.

204
00:15:40,583 --> 00:15:41,791
What are you thinking of?

205
00:15:41,875 --> 00:15:43,000
Of when I was little.

206
00:15:47,125 --> 00:15:48,208
When I was happy.

207
00:15:50,458 --> 00:15:52,125
About how things used to be.

208
00:15:55,583 --> 00:15:57,416
Now, open your eyes.

209
00:16:03,750 --> 00:16:05,125
Whoa.

210
00:16:07,958 --> 00:16:10,166
- No, no. I'm not ready yet.
- I still...

211
00:16:12,291 --> 00:16:14,500
- Are you certain this is safe?
- Of course it is.

212
00:16:14,583 --> 00:16:15,916
I haven't fallen yet.

213
00:16:16,541 --> 00:16:17,541
I can fly?

214
00:16:18,250 --> 00:16:19,583
I think I'm gonna be sick.

215
00:16:23,041 --> 00:16:25,166
I can fly!

216
00:16:33,875 --> 00:16:35,416
Goodbye, Nana!

217
00:17:21,666 --> 00:17:22,666
Yay!

218
00:17:23,750 --> 00:17:24,750
I'm flying!

219
00:17:25,458 --> 00:17:26,500
Yay!

220
00:17:45,083 --> 00:17:46,333
There it is!

221
00:17:46,416 --> 00:17:49,083
Second star to the right
and straight on 'til morning.

222
00:18:39,333 --> 00:18:40,416
Look!

223
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:41,583
I see it!

224
00:18:42,750 --> 00:18:44,375
-Is that...
-Neverland!

225
00:19:12,041 --> 00:19:13,458
Wait for us, Wendy!

226
00:19:14,416 --> 00:19:16,541
Is this everything
you've dreamed of?

227
00:19:16,625 --> 00:19:18,291
I could never have dreamed of this!

228
00:19:18,375 --> 00:19:20,250
Come on, there's more!

229
00:19:55,041 --> 00:19:57,125
Oh. Oh, no!

230
00:19:57,750 --> 00:19:59,333
Oh, no!

231
00:20:09,750 --> 00:20:10,750
He's back!

232
00:20:11,208 --> 00:20:12,666
Hey!

233
00:20:12,750 --> 00:20:16,166
Get your eyes to the sky!
The boy! He's back!

234
00:20:26,875 --> 00:20:27,875
Yes, what?

235
00:20:27,958 --> 00:20:32,250
Uh, it's the boy, Captain.
It's Peter Pa...

236
00:20:40,708 --> 00:20:41,791
Never...

237
00:20:42,500 --> 00:20:43,500
say...

238
00:20:45,166 --> 00:20:46,291
his name.

239
00:20:51,416 --> 00:20:53,041
Sorry, Captain.

240
00:20:54,208 --> 00:20:55,375
Mr. Smee.

241
00:20:57,500 --> 00:20:58,500
Smee,

242
00:20:59,916 --> 00:21:01,875
make a note. My cabin needs a new door.

243
00:21:02,375 --> 00:21:05,166
A new door. Yes. Uh, right.

244
00:21:05,833 --> 00:21:10,416
Might I say, Captain, uh,
that will be your third door this month.

245
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:11,833
And it won't be the last.

246
00:21:11,916 --> 00:21:13,125
Where's my telescope?

247
00:21:14,625 --> 00:21:16,375
Telescope! Smee.

248
00:21:17,250 --> 00:21:18,625
Telescope at hand, Captain.

249
00:21:20,875 --> 00:21:23,833
Speak not to me of hands, Smee.

250
00:21:24,583 --> 00:21:27,083
Oh, I see your point. Uh...

251
00:21:30,833 --> 00:21:32,833
- Where is he, then?
- Over there, Captain.

252
00:21:36,458 --> 00:21:37,458
There you are.

253
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,083
Footloose and flying free.

254
00:21:41,875 --> 00:21:43,125
But not for long.

255
00:21:43,750 --> 00:21:45,333
What'd you have us do, Captain?

256
00:21:48,291 --> 00:21:52,125
Why, let's invite him down
for a spot of tea.

257
00:21:52,208 --> 00:21:53,958
Tea. Excellent idea.

258
00:21:54,666 --> 00:21:57,666
Hear that boys? Put the kettle on.

259
00:21:57,750 --> 00:21:59,250
It's tea time!

260
00:22:15,791 --> 00:22:16,791
There. Look.

261
00:22:16,875 --> 00:22:18,000
Yeah.

262
00:22:23,666 --> 00:22:24,666
What was that?

263
00:22:25,083 --> 00:22:26,250
Pirates. Come on.

264
00:22:30,458 --> 00:22:31,458
Come on, Michael!

265
00:22:44,041 --> 00:22:45,041
It's Hook!

266
00:22:45,666 --> 00:22:46,666
Captain Hook?

267
00:22:46,750 --> 00:22:49,416
Who else would try to kill me
this early in the morning?

268
00:22:49,500 --> 00:22:51,875
Fire!

269
00:23:00,916 --> 00:23:01,958
Follow me.

270
00:23:10,666 --> 00:23:12,041
Now, listen close.

271
00:23:12,125 --> 00:23:14,208
I'll lead the charge,
you three take up the rear

272
00:23:14,291 --> 00:23:15,750
and we'll storm them, fore to aft.

273
00:23:16,166 --> 00:23:17,416
They'll never see us coming.

274
00:23:17,500 --> 00:23:19,500
Move!

275
00:23:19,583 --> 00:23:23,250
Remember, all pirates are fair game,
but leave Hook...

276
00:23:24,125 --> 00:23:25,125
to me.

277
00:23:30,083 --> 00:23:31,083
Did I hit him?

278
00:23:31,833 --> 00:23:33,250
Well, you hit someone, Captain.

279
00:24:13,250 --> 00:24:14,250
Oh, no.

280
00:24:15,166 --> 00:24:16,208
John?

281
00:24:17,458 --> 00:24:19,000
Michael?

282
00:24:22,166 --> 00:24:23,708
John?

283
00:24:23,791 --> 00:24:25,291
Michael?

284
00:24:27,500 --> 00:24:30,583
Tinker Bell? Can you hear me?

285
00:24:31,583 --> 00:24:32,916
Peter!

286
00:24:34,083 --> 00:24:35,333
Anyone?

287
00:24:55,750 --> 00:24:56,750
Look!

288
00:24:56,833 --> 00:24:58,416
She has his hat!

289
00:24:59,250 --> 00:25:00,875
What have you done with Peter?

290
00:25:00,958 --> 00:25:03,125
I haven't done anything with Peter.

291
00:25:04,500 --> 00:25:05,541
Where did you all...

292
00:25:07,708 --> 00:25:08,916
Not another move!

293
00:25:17,166 --> 00:25:18,166
Pardon?

294
00:25:19,041 --> 00:25:20,416
Are you the Wendy?

295
00:25:23,041 --> 00:25:24,250
Well, I'm a Wendy.

296
00:25:24,333 --> 00:25:25,916
The Wendy Peter went to find?

297
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,000
The Wendy who knows the bedtime stories?

298
00:25:28,083 --> 00:25:30,666
'Cause if you don't know stories
then you're an imposter.

299
00:25:30,750 --> 00:25:32,958
And you know what we do with imposters.

300
00:25:35,791 --> 00:25:37,208
Stop doing that!

301
00:25:50,375 --> 00:25:51,375
Are you...

302
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:53,416
Are you Tiger Lily?

303
00:25:55,541 --> 00:25:56,666
Which means you must be...

304
00:25:56,750 --> 00:25:58,583
-Lost Boys.
-Every last one of us.

305
00:25:59,916 --> 00:26:02,125
-But you're not all boys.
-So?

306
00:26:03,041 --> 00:26:04,666
Well, I guess it doesn't really matter.

307
00:26:04,750 --> 00:26:06,708
What matters is,
what you've done with Peter.

308
00:26:06,791 --> 00:26:07,791
Give me that.

309
00:26:08,625 --> 00:26:10,041
I haven't done anything with him.

310
00:26:11,541 --> 00:26:13,416
He came and collected me and my brothers.

311
00:26:13,500 --> 00:26:14,500
Brothers?

312
00:26:14,583 --> 00:26:16,583
Peter didn't say anything about brothers!

313
00:26:16,666 --> 00:26:18,666
That's what I've been trying
to tell you all.

314
00:26:18,750 --> 00:26:21,416
We were flying, and then,
we were attacked.

315
00:26:21,500 --> 00:26:22,583
-Attacked?
-Yes.

316
00:26:22,666 --> 00:26:24,125
- By pirates!
- I knew it.

317
00:26:24,208 --> 00:26:26,875
- I knew it was a bad day to fly.
- No, you didn't.

318
00:26:26,958 --> 00:26:29,750
- Bellweather, telescope.
- At all? I didn't say it at all?

319
00:26:29,833 --> 00:26:31,583
- I didn't say it?
- You did not say it.

320
00:26:31,666 --> 00:26:36,875
I said it when Peter asked us
to look for... whoever this is... I win.

321
00:26:36,958 --> 00:26:39,000
You never said it. No.

322
00:26:39,083 --> 00:26:42,000
These brothers of yours,
what do they look like?

323
00:26:42,791 --> 00:26:48,208
Well, John's this tall
and Michael's this tall

324
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:51,541
and John, he has a hat. He has a top hat.

325
00:26:51,625 --> 00:26:54,666
-Ooh, a hat!
-Yes, but I don't know if he's wearing it.

326
00:26:54,750 --> 00:26:57,583
So, he might be this tall. And...

327
00:26:59,125 --> 00:27:00,375
Does one of them have a bear?

328
00:27:00,458 --> 00:27:02,125
Mr. Bear, yes, that's Michael.

329
00:27:04,541 --> 00:27:06,541
There's definitely pirates, all right.

330
00:27:09,583 --> 00:27:11,291
Well, I don't see anything.

331
00:27:14,458 --> 00:27:17,916
-I don't trust...
-She's too grown up, isn't she?

332
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:20,250
- Yep, too old.
- Isn't she?

333
00:27:26,500 --> 00:27:28,416
You're just looking the wrong way.

334
00:27:39,750 --> 00:27:44,583
Oh, I see it! There's John
and Michael and a pirate ship!

335
00:27:44,666 --> 00:27:46,291
And pirates.

336
00:27:48,958 --> 00:27:49,958
Oh, dear!

337
00:27:55,416 --> 00:27:56,541
Come along, lads.

338
00:27:56,625 --> 00:28:00,000
Don't fancy yourselves the first
half-pints to be found afloating.

339
00:28:00,083 --> 00:28:02,083
Well, I rescued the Captain from the sea

340
00:28:02,166 --> 00:28:04,083
when he was scarcely taller
than yourselves.

341
00:28:04,166 --> 00:28:06,083
Of course he weren't captain then.

342
00:28:06,166 --> 00:28:09,041
He didn't have a hook.
He was just a little lost child,

343
00:28:09,125 --> 00:28:11,375
desperate to make it back
to these fine shores

344
00:28:11,458 --> 00:28:13,250
before he got too old to enjoy them.

345
00:28:13,333 --> 00:28:16,041
All right, make some rooms for our guests.
Come on, come on.

346
00:28:16,125 --> 00:28:18,333
Ooh, a fresh catch from the sea.

347
00:28:18,416 --> 00:28:23,166
Hey. That's a fine bear you got there.
Did you kill that yourself?

348
00:28:23,250 --> 00:28:25,375
Don't you touch Mr. Bear!

349
00:28:25,458 --> 00:28:27,208
Ooh!

350
00:28:27,291 --> 00:28:28,291
Mr. Bear.

351
00:28:29,583 --> 00:28:30,750
Leave him alone!

352
00:28:42,708 --> 00:28:44,750
What do you have for me, Mr. Smee?

353
00:28:45,375 --> 00:28:47,083
Good tidings, I hope.

354
00:28:47,416 --> 00:28:48,791
No, not today,

355
00:28:48,875 --> 00:28:53,583
but... but we fished these little fellas
out of the drink.

356
00:28:53,666 --> 00:28:59,500
One of them is in possession of a small,
but possibly dangerous, bear.

357
00:29:01,250 --> 00:29:05,666
And all three of them may be compatriots
of you-know-who.

358
00:29:20,166 --> 00:29:21,166
Shh.

359
00:29:22,375 --> 00:29:23,750
What's that?

360
00:29:26,708 --> 00:29:27,708
Listen.

361
00:29:30,916 --> 00:29:32,333
Do you hear what I hear?

362
00:29:34,208 --> 00:29:36,208
-I don't think so.
-Listen!

363
00:29:38,583 --> 00:29:39,583
Listen.

364
00:29:42,250 --> 00:29:43,458
There it is again.

365
00:29:48,333 --> 00:29:49,333
Teeny.

366
00:29:55,125 --> 00:29:56,125
Tiny.

367
00:30:10,708 --> 00:30:12,333
Oh, that's it.

368
00:30:14,916 --> 00:30:16,041
Mr. Smee.

369
00:30:16,125 --> 00:30:17,250
Yes, Captain?

370
00:30:17,333 --> 00:30:23,125
What are the rules on my ship?

371
00:30:23,208 --> 00:30:26,791
As they be tattooed on me heart.

372
00:30:26,875 --> 00:30:31,208
One, each pirate upon first embarking
shall be entitled...

373
00:30:31,291 --> 00:30:33,625
Start at 37.

374
00:30:33,708 --> 00:30:36,541
Yes, quite right. Rule 37,

375
00:30:37,666 --> 00:30:40,125
no one shall say the boy's name.

376
00:30:40,208 --> 00:30:42,958
Rule 38, no whistling.

377
00:30:43,041 --> 00:30:44,666
Rule 39...

378
00:30:51,041 --> 00:30:52,041
No...

379
00:30:52,833 --> 00:30:53,833
clocks.

380
00:30:55,125 --> 00:30:56,125
That's it.

381
00:30:57,250 --> 00:30:58,250
Now,

382
00:30:59,166 --> 00:31:00,208
tell me.

383
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:04,583
How did you come to Neverland?

384
00:31:04,666 --> 00:31:07,125
-We came with Pe...
-Please don't break the rules!

385
00:31:07,875 --> 00:31:09,208
Do not say his name.

386
00:31:09,291 --> 00:31:12,416
We don't care about your rules.
We came with Peter Pan.

387
00:31:14,500 --> 00:31:15,875
And he's gonna rescue us.

388
00:31:15,958 --> 00:31:17,500
He said his name.

389
00:31:17,583 --> 00:31:19,958
Dibs on the bear after he executes them.

390
00:31:24,916 --> 00:31:26,541
He's going to rescue you?

391
00:31:27,208 --> 00:31:29,208
Well... Probably.

392
00:31:30,375 --> 00:31:31,791
Hopefully.

393
00:31:35,458 --> 00:31:36,458
Hope.

394
00:31:37,416 --> 00:31:39,250
Most days, I hate that word.

395
00:31:41,250 --> 00:31:42,458
But on this occasion...

396
00:31:46,583 --> 00:31:47,583
I wonder.

397
00:31:49,083 --> 00:31:50,083
Mr. Smee.

398
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:52,000
Yes, Cap?

399
00:31:53,833 --> 00:31:55,458
Are you thinking what I'm thinking?

400
00:31:55,541 --> 00:31:59,000
-The plank.
-He's gonna make them walk the plank.

401
00:31:59,583 --> 00:32:01,791
-That a cup of tea'd be nice right now.
-No.

402
00:32:05,541 --> 00:32:07,625
Rouse yourselves, lads.

403
00:32:09,625 --> 00:32:10,833
Set a course

404
00:32:11,541 --> 00:32:12,750
for Skull Rock.

405
00:32:16,500 --> 00:32:19,208
Heave ho, Heave ho

406
00:32:19,291 --> 00:32:21,875
-Heave ho
-Dark and quiet are the devils in the deep

407
00:32:21,958 --> 00:32:24,208
So slow and silent
So you're swallowed in your sleep

408
00:32:24,291 --> 00:32:26,500
With a tail and a tooth
And I'm telling you the truth

409
00:32:26,583 --> 00:32:29,041
You'll be boiling in the belly
Of a behemoth

410
00:32:29,125 --> 00:32:31,583
They're headed to Skull Rock.

411
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:33,375
Just as I feared.

412
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:35,166
Wonder why they call it...

413
00:32:38,041 --> 00:32:39,125
Oh, my...

414
00:32:43,041 --> 00:32:45,375
There's only one reason
pirates go to Skull Rock.

415
00:32:46,208 --> 00:32:47,500
An execution is nigh.

416
00:32:47,583 --> 00:32:49,125
An execution?

417
00:32:49,208 --> 00:32:51,958
Then what are we waiting for?
Let's go rescue them.

418
00:32:53,125 --> 00:32:54,125
Dark and quiet are the devils in the deep

419
00:32:54,208 --> 00:32:56,541
So slow and silent
So you're swallowed in your sleep

420
00:32:56,625 --> 00:32:58,916
With a tail and a tooth
And I'm telling you the truth

421
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:00,833
You'll be boiling in the belly
Of a behemoth

422
00:33:02,791 --> 00:33:04,125
...your sights abroad

423
00:33:04,208 --> 00:33:06,250
And suddenly the suction of a cephalopod

424
00:33:06,333 --> 00:33:08,750
Has you thinking twice take my advice

425
00:33:08,833 --> 00:33:11,500
A mutineer should also fear a firing squad

426
00:33:11,583 --> 00:33:14,875
Ho!

427
00:33:21,333 --> 00:33:22,875
Ho!

428
00:33:26,375 --> 00:33:29,333
You can get anywhere
in Neverland down here.

429
00:33:29,416 --> 00:33:30,625
If you know the way.

430
00:33:30,708 --> 00:33:34,541
It's particularly useful
when you wanna hide from pirates.

431
00:33:34,625 --> 00:33:36,083
Which is my preference.

432
00:33:36,166 --> 00:33:38,000
Why is Captain Hook so hateful?

433
00:33:38,083 --> 00:33:40,625
- Because he grew up.
- And grew up wrong.

434
00:33:40,708 --> 00:33:43,666
-But he's still the best swordsman.
-Which also makes him...

435
00:33:43,750 --> 00:33:46,041
-The worst.
-Which is why we leave him to Peter.

436
00:33:46,125 --> 00:33:49,291
Who he hates
because Peter cut off his hand.

437
00:33:49,375 --> 00:33:51,750
Fed it to the crocodile.
Well, along with his watch.

438
00:33:51,833 --> 00:33:54,916
-You know about the crocodile?
-That's how the story goes.

439
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:57,708
Wait, you mean I'm in a story?

440
00:33:57,791 --> 00:33:59,041
Shh!

441
00:34:15,750 --> 00:34:16,750
Don't look at that.

442
00:34:19,916 --> 00:34:21,125
Oh, no.

443
00:34:22,166 --> 00:34:23,166
Poor Robert.

444
00:34:25,916 --> 00:34:27,541
Oh, look, there they are.

445
00:34:27,625 --> 00:34:29,666
For goodness sakes, Michael can't swim.

446
00:34:37,250 --> 00:34:38,250
Captain.

447
00:34:42,500 --> 00:34:43,500
Oops.

448
00:34:45,750 --> 00:34:47,375
Tide's rising.

449
00:34:49,125 --> 00:34:51,041
Poor little cast aways.

450
00:34:52,291 --> 00:34:53,291
Tell me.

451
00:34:54,625 --> 00:34:56,625
What will you hold on to?

452
00:34:57,875 --> 00:34:58,875
Your hope?

453
00:35:00,958 --> 00:35:02,125
Or your breath?

454
00:35:02,208 --> 00:35:03,208
You can't kill us.

455
00:35:03,875 --> 00:35:06,041
-We've done nothing wrong.
-Oh, yes you have.

456
00:35:06,125 --> 00:35:07,291
You're doing it right now.

457
00:35:08,833 --> 00:35:11,458
I've found you guilty of being a child,

458
00:35:12,583 --> 00:35:15,041
and we can't have children...

459
00:35:15,958 --> 00:35:16,958
in Neverland.

460
00:35:17,041 --> 00:35:21,125
Rule 44, no children in Neverland.

461
00:35:21,208 --> 00:35:23,583
No children in Neverland

462
00:35:23,666 --> 00:35:25,875
No children in Neverland

463
00:35:25,958 --> 00:35:28,333
No children in Neverland

464
00:35:28,416 --> 00:35:30,791
No children in Neverland

465
00:35:30,875 --> 00:35:33,333
No children in Neverland

466
00:35:33,416 --> 00:35:35,708
No children in Neverland

467
00:35:35,791 --> 00:35:38,541
No children in Neverland

468
00:35:38,625 --> 00:35:41,541
No children in Neverland

469
00:35:41,625 --> 00:35:44,083
No one but children in Neverland

470
00:35:44,166 --> 00:35:46,625
No one but children in Neverland

471
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:49,083
No one but children in Neverland

472
00:35:49,625 --> 00:35:52,250
No one but children in Neverland

473
00:35:52,333 --> 00:35:54,583
No one but children in Neverland

474
00:35:55,041 --> 00:35:57,166
No one but children in Neverland

475
00:35:57,250 --> 00:35:59,500
Quiet!

476
00:35:59,583 --> 00:36:01,250
...in Neverland

477
00:36:04,583 --> 00:36:05,583
You.

478
00:36:07,208 --> 00:36:08,208
What is your name?

479
00:36:09,166 --> 00:36:11,375
How long have you served on my ship?

480
00:36:15,125 --> 00:36:17,750
Hey. Answer your captain.

481
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:27,000
Fake beard.

482
00:36:33,458 --> 00:36:35,541
I've got to say,
it's not half bad being a pirate.

483
00:36:35,625 --> 00:36:36,666
Pan!

484
00:36:38,250 --> 00:36:39,583
It's far better being me.

485
00:36:55,875 --> 00:36:57,416
Mr. Bear!

486
00:37:00,666 --> 00:37:02,000
Oh, he's just showing off.

487
00:37:02,083 --> 00:37:04,291
Oh, he's not showing off yet.

488
00:37:20,375 --> 00:37:22,000
Now he's showing off.

489
00:37:22,458 --> 00:37:24,458
Captain Hook.

490
00:37:24,541 --> 00:37:27,125
You're looking a little worse for wear,
old man.

491
00:37:27,208 --> 00:37:29,958
You sure you won't be happier
back in your sick-bed?

492
00:37:31,416 --> 00:37:32,416
Not today, boy.

493
00:37:33,291 --> 00:37:36,291
I woke this morning
with a tune in my heart.

494
00:37:39,125 --> 00:37:40,666
Do you know what the refrain was?

495
00:37:42,375 --> 00:37:44,625
Yo ho, yo hey

496
00:37:44,708 --> 00:37:47,250
Oh, brother. Hook's singing again.

497
00:37:47,333 --> 00:37:49,833
Peter Pan shall perish today

498
00:37:50,625 --> 00:37:54,041
Dark and sinister man.
Prepare to meet thy doom.

499
00:37:54,625 --> 00:37:56,333
Proud and insolent youth.

500
00:37:57,833 --> 00:37:58,833
Have at me!

501
00:38:13,625 --> 00:38:14,625
Come with me.

502
00:38:15,125 --> 00:38:16,125
Trust me.

503
00:38:16,583 --> 00:38:19,375
Oh, good morning, Mr. Smee.

504
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:29,208
Oh, the fairy.

505
00:38:53,250 --> 00:38:54,666
John. Michael.

506
00:38:54,750 --> 00:38:56,583
- Wendy!
- Shh.

507
00:38:56,666 --> 00:38:58,666
Look what they did to Mr. Bear.

508
00:39:01,375 --> 00:39:02,375
Oh, my...

509
00:39:12,208 --> 00:39:13,291
Yes! Get his hat!

510
00:39:19,125 --> 00:39:20,333
Bad form!

511
00:39:25,916 --> 00:39:27,333
Oh, Tinker Bell. Thank goodness.

512
00:39:28,083 --> 00:39:29,083
Can you help us?

513
00:39:33,708 --> 00:39:34,708
Yes!

514
00:39:35,041 --> 00:39:36,375
Oh, Wendy.

515
00:39:37,291 --> 00:39:38,291
You're still alive!

516
00:39:38,375 --> 00:39:40,958
Yes, I am and so are you.

517
00:39:41,041 --> 00:39:42,708
I thought that maybe you had...

518
00:39:42,791 --> 00:39:43,833
Died? Perished?

519
00:39:43,916 --> 00:39:45,166
- Been blown to bits?
- Yes!

520
00:39:45,250 --> 00:39:48,000
Not a chance. I'm quite good
at not getting kill...

521
00:39:51,625 --> 00:39:53,625
Got you!

522
00:39:55,708 --> 00:39:58,791
I beat you.

523
00:39:59,958 --> 00:40:03,666
Don't even think about helping, Tink.

524
00:40:06,625 --> 00:40:07,833
Wretched fairy.

525
00:40:08,666 --> 00:40:10,666
Very bad form, Captain Hook.

526
00:40:12,125 --> 00:40:14,291
All my bad form, I learnt from you.

527
00:40:14,833 --> 00:40:16,041
Don't flatter yourself.

528
00:40:16,916 --> 00:40:18,541
You've always been rotten.

529
00:40:18,625 --> 00:40:22,125
A stinking, rotten codfish.

530
00:40:25,750 --> 00:40:28,375
You've stabbed me in my heart
with your words.

531
00:40:29,666 --> 00:40:31,083
For the last time.

532
00:40:33,958 --> 00:40:37,333
Now, I will repay in kind with my sword.

533
00:40:40,583 --> 00:40:42,875
Strike then, if you've got the courage.

534
00:40:44,291 --> 00:40:45,291
And strike true.

535
00:40:47,583 --> 00:40:48,583
For to die

536
00:40:48,666 --> 00:40:51,875
-will be an awfully big adventure.
-An awfully big adventure.

537
00:40:55,666 --> 00:40:56,875
Hey, stop!

538
00:41:01,041 --> 00:41:02,041
Who are you?

539
00:41:06,208 --> 00:41:07,833
I've never seen you here before!

540
00:41:08,750 --> 00:41:11,375
-Well, you see, I'm...
-She's a Wendy.

541
00:41:11,458 --> 00:41:12,875
- A Wendy!
- A Wendy!

542
00:41:17,083 --> 00:41:18,166
A Wendy?

543
00:41:18,958 --> 00:41:21,166
-What's a Wendy?
-I'm a Wendy.

544
00:41:22,041 --> 00:41:24,333
Wendy Moira Angela Darling.

545
00:41:24,416 --> 00:41:29,625
And I am from London, England
where gentlemen do not harm children!

546
00:41:32,750 --> 00:41:34,041
Well.

547
00:41:35,166 --> 00:41:39,083
-I am...
-Captain Hook. I know.

548
00:41:40,750 --> 00:41:43,583
-And we are in...
-Neverland.

549
00:41:45,625 --> 00:41:46,833
And this child...

550
00:41:47,666 --> 00:41:48,875
is no child.

551
00:41:50,625 --> 00:41:53,791
Nor I a gentle man.

552
00:41:54,750 --> 00:41:57,708
So, say your goodbyes, Wendy.

553
00:41:59,208 --> 00:42:03,500
For you shan't be seeing him
in this world again.

554
00:42:09,041 --> 00:42:10,041
No.

555
00:42:10,791 --> 00:42:11,833
Oh, God.

556
00:42:19,791 --> 00:42:21,833
That is one big crocodile.

557
00:42:27,166 --> 00:42:28,625
Look!

558
00:42:28,708 --> 00:42:30,000
Avast, great beast!

559
00:42:36,750 --> 00:42:37,750
No! No! No!

560
00:42:38,958 --> 00:42:39,958
Oh, my!

561
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:44,916
Run! Run!

562
00:42:55,416 --> 00:42:56,958
Tally ho!

563
00:42:58,791 --> 00:43:00,208
Come on. Let's go.

564
00:43:54,250 --> 00:43:55,333
Well, that was fun.

565
00:44:01,875 --> 00:44:04,625
It was an adventure.
Isn't that what you wanted?

566
00:44:04,708 --> 00:44:08,000
Yes, but I didn't think that meant
being shot out of the sky by pirates.

567
00:44:08,083 --> 00:44:09,083
Or drowned.

568
00:44:09,166 --> 00:44:10,916
Or dismembered.

569
00:44:14,541 --> 00:44:17,125
Tinker Bell, I don't understand you.
What are you saying?

570
00:44:17,208 --> 00:44:19,208
What she's saying is, I saved the day.

571
00:44:19,291 --> 00:44:21,041
You sort of saved the day.

572
00:44:21,125 --> 00:44:22,541
You saved part of the day.

573
00:44:22,625 --> 00:44:24,333
And I did a pretty good job at it.

574
00:44:25,666 --> 00:44:26,958
And it's not like you had

575
00:44:27,041 --> 00:44:29,083
-any help at all.
-No, I didn't.

576
00:44:29,166 --> 00:44:30,166
I'm Peter Pan.

577
00:44:30,583 --> 00:44:32,291
I don't ever need help.

578
00:44:33,333 --> 00:44:35,541
You have a magical fairy
that makes you fly.

579
00:44:36,708 --> 00:44:39,958
A gaggle of children to do your bidding,
a princess who cleans up after you

580
00:44:40,041 --> 00:44:41,791
while you're off gallivanting
with pirates.

581
00:44:42,625 --> 00:44:45,916
Do you really think that
you could beat Captain Hook on your own?

582
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:47,833
-What's a gaggle?
-Hmm.

583
00:44:47,916 --> 00:44:49,958
Of course, I could. I always beat him.

584
00:44:50,041 --> 00:44:52,250
That's just how it works. Always has.

585
00:44:52,333 --> 00:44:53,333
Always will.

586
00:44:53,916 --> 00:44:56,166
And what happens if it doesn't?

587
00:44:57,125 --> 00:44:58,416
Yes, what happens then?

588
00:44:59,666 --> 00:45:00,833
That won't ever happen.

589
00:45:00,916 --> 00:45:02,916
- Will it, Peter?
- Of course not.

590
00:45:03,291 --> 00:45:04,666
This is Neverland.

591
00:45:04,750 --> 00:45:06,500
Where nothing ever changes.

592
00:45:07,375 --> 00:45:08,416
Least of all, me.

593
00:45:10,083 --> 00:45:11,083
Right.

594
00:45:20,208 --> 00:45:22,208
It's not true
what Peter says, you know?

595
00:45:22,291 --> 00:45:23,416
Some things do change.

596
00:45:23,500 --> 00:45:25,625
-We're not to talk.
-We're not to talk.

597
00:45:25,708 --> 00:45:27,916
What? What aren't you
supposed to talk about?

598
00:45:30,500 --> 00:45:32,250
Hook wasn't always Hook.

599
00:45:56,583 --> 00:45:58,083
Come along, don't dilly-dally.

600
00:46:03,750 --> 00:46:04,958
What is this place?

601
00:46:05,583 --> 00:46:06,583
It's home.

602
00:46:07,083 --> 00:46:08,083
Come on.

603
00:46:19,875 --> 00:46:20,958
Aren't you coming?

604
00:46:21,041 --> 00:46:22,041
No.

605
00:46:23,125 --> 00:46:24,791
It's their home, not mine.

606
00:46:27,083 --> 00:46:28,708
Not yours either, I don't think.

607
00:46:31,583 --> 00:46:33,875
I don't know where my home is exactly...

608
00:46:36,583 --> 00:46:37,833
Or where I want it to be.

609
00:46:38,750 --> 00:46:39,750
You will.

610
00:46:43,083 --> 00:46:44,916
The first time I rode out on my own,

611
00:46:48,375 --> 00:46:49,958
my great great grandmother,

612
00:46:51,333 --> 00:46:53,333
she came to me and said,

613
00:46:54,125 --> 00:46:56,500
"Feel the ground beneath your feet,

614
00:46:57,875 --> 00:47:01,375
"so that your eyes can find the stars.

615
00:47:01,458 --> 00:47:03,291
"Hold the past in your heart,

616
00:47:04,541 --> 00:47:08,166
"but know that where you go from here,
it's up to you."

617
00:47:15,791 --> 00:47:16,791
Sleep tight,

618
00:47:17,666 --> 00:47:19,291
Wendy Moira Angela Darling.

619
00:47:21,083 --> 00:47:22,375
Then get home safe.

620
00:47:44,916 --> 00:47:45,916
Hi, Wendy.

621
00:47:50,166 --> 00:47:51,875
Well, how did you find this place?

622
00:47:52,708 --> 00:47:55,541
Peter found it.
Just like he found all of us.

623
00:47:57,583 --> 00:47:58,958
Just like he found me.

624
00:47:59,875 --> 00:48:01,125
Exactly.

625
00:48:29,208 --> 00:48:30,583
Wendy?

626
00:48:30,666 --> 00:48:32,333
Can you tell us a bedtime story, now?

627
00:48:32,791 --> 00:48:35,000
-Yes! Bedtime stories!
-Yes! Bedtime stories!

628
00:48:36,625 --> 00:48:38,250
We've been waiting forever.

629
00:48:39,583 --> 00:48:40,916
Well, I could,

630
00:48:42,416 --> 00:48:46,250
but I was thinking, perhaps,
Peter could tell us a story first.

631
00:48:46,708 --> 00:48:48,208
- What about?
- I don't know.

632
00:48:49,708 --> 00:48:51,333
Maybe how you came to Neverland?

633
00:48:51,750 --> 00:48:52,958
Or how you met Captain Hook.

634
00:48:55,041 --> 00:48:57,416
It's a very short story
and it goes like this...

635
00:48:58,041 --> 00:49:00,750
I fought Captain Hook in a duel
and I cut off his hand.

636
00:49:00,833 --> 00:49:02,458
Yes. Yes. Everyone knows that.

637
00:49:03,416 --> 00:49:04,666
How'd you two meet?

638
00:49:05,500 --> 00:49:07,458
Why'd you start fighting
in the first place?

639
00:49:07,541 --> 00:49:08,958
Because he's a pirate.

640
00:49:10,500 --> 00:49:11,500
And I'm Peter Pan.

641
00:49:11,583 --> 00:49:13,833
But surely, it can't be as simple as that.

642
00:49:13,916 --> 00:49:14,916
Why not?

643
00:49:16,333 --> 00:49:17,583
Because nothing ever is.

644
00:49:19,458 --> 00:49:20,458
Where are you two from?

645
00:49:21,708 --> 00:49:23,333
Where's his mother and father?

646
00:49:23,958 --> 00:49:24,958
Where are yours?

647
00:49:25,041 --> 00:49:27,208
Uh, that's a trick question.

648
00:49:28,041 --> 00:49:31,208
This is Neverland
where there are no mothers and fathers.

649
00:49:31,291 --> 00:49:32,500
Why aren't there?

650
00:49:33,041 --> 00:49:34,500
I don't remember my mother.

651
00:49:34,583 --> 00:49:36,125
Well, now you don't have to.

652
00:49:36,750 --> 00:49:38,166
Wendy can be our mother.

653
00:49:38,833 --> 00:49:39,833
Goodness, no.

654
00:49:40,500 --> 00:49:42,708
I don't even know
if I want to be a mother.

655
00:49:43,791 --> 00:49:44,875
But I still have one.

656
00:49:45,708 --> 00:49:46,708
So do you,

657
00:49:47,416 --> 00:49:48,416
and you,

658
00:49:49,458 --> 00:49:50,458
and all of you.

659
00:49:52,208 --> 00:49:53,625
Somewhere out there...

660
00:49:56,416 --> 00:49:57,416
she misses you.

661
00:50:01,541 --> 00:50:03,291
She loves you very much.

662
00:50:04,083 --> 00:50:05,750
I wouldn't mind seeing my mother again.

663
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:08,000
Yes, you would.

664
00:50:08,416 --> 00:50:10,875
If you went back home,
it would be the end of all our fun.

665
00:50:10,958 --> 00:50:11,958
All our adventures.

666
00:50:12,625 --> 00:50:15,291
All you'd have left... is growing up.

667
00:50:19,250 --> 00:50:22,083
It's never good when Peter
starts slamming doors.

668
00:50:22,583 --> 00:50:24,500
I'm sorry I asked for a story, Wendy.

669
00:50:24,583 --> 00:50:26,083
Oh, it's not your fault.

670
00:50:27,958 --> 00:50:29,375
How about...

671
00:50:33,875 --> 00:50:36,708
How about I sing you a lullaby instead?

672
00:50:37,125 --> 00:50:38,125
What's a lullaby?

673
00:50:38,916 --> 00:50:42,458
It's a song that my mother sings me
and my brothers sometimes.

674
00:50:43,625 --> 00:50:45,208
I believe it goes like this...

675
00:50:49,250 --> 00:50:54,958
It's time to fall asleep, my friends

676
00:50:55,791 --> 00:51:02,583
And dream of fun that never ends

677
00:51:03,208 --> 00:51:08,833
Like swift adventures up above

678
00:51:09,583 --> 00:51:14,666
And roaring fires and mother's love

679
00:51:15,125 --> 00:51:21,625
For when she turns in the moonlight

680
00:51:22,291 --> 00:51:28,625
She knows you're up above the night

681
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:35,000
Do you hear that?

682
00:51:38,166 --> 00:51:39,291
What is that?

683
00:51:39,375 --> 00:51:40,875
Fruit bats.

684
00:51:40,958 --> 00:51:42,291
They come in this time of year.

685
00:51:42,375 --> 00:51:43,666
No. Listen...

686
00:51:46,666 --> 00:51:47,666
I believe,

687
00:51:51,916 --> 00:51:54,375
I've heard something like that before.

688
00:52:20,333 --> 00:52:23,750
Dear, Tinker Bell,
I wish I could understand you.

689
00:52:27,541 --> 00:52:29,375
I don't think that Peter can either.

690
00:52:29,458 --> 00:52:31,458
He actually doesn't listen, does he?

691
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:37,000
Well, it's his loss, not yours.

692
00:52:39,291 --> 00:52:41,625
I'm sure you've
simply wonderful things to say.

693
00:53:10,291 --> 00:53:11,416
"James."

694
00:53:12,083 --> 00:53:13,083
Who's James?

695
00:53:18,583 --> 00:53:19,583
Oh.

696
00:53:25,125 --> 00:53:26,125
Peter?

697
00:53:28,833 --> 00:53:31,041
Oh, Peter, come on.

698
00:53:31,791 --> 00:53:33,083
Don't be like that.

699
00:53:38,625 --> 00:53:41,166
- What's this?
- It's a kiss.

700
00:53:41,875 --> 00:53:44,708
I made it for you, so we'd both have one.

701
00:53:45,791 --> 00:53:47,208
I thought we'd be friends.

702
00:53:48,041 --> 00:53:49,875
Instead, we're just...

703
00:53:49,958 --> 00:53:51,041
Fighting.

704
00:53:53,833 --> 00:53:55,250
Just like you and Hook.

705
00:53:59,875 --> 00:54:01,791
Hook was a friend of yours, wasn't he?

706
00:54:04,291 --> 00:54:05,500
He was my best friend.

707
00:54:08,375 --> 00:54:09,791
And the very first Lost Boy.

708
00:54:11,416 --> 00:54:12,500
And what happened?

709
00:54:14,458 --> 00:54:18,041
Neverland... just wasn't good enough
for him, I guess.

710
00:54:21,208 --> 00:54:24,041
He sailed away one morning without a word

711
00:54:25,375 --> 00:54:26,708
and left me all alone.

712
00:54:28,875 --> 00:54:31,250
When he returned, he'd changed.

713
00:54:32,916 --> 00:54:33,916
He was cruel.

714
00:54:34,875 --> 00:54:36,166
Evil.

715
00:54:36,250 --> 00:54:39,250
Was he though? Or had he just grown up?

716
00:54:39,333 --> 00:54:40,458
What's the difference?

717
00:54:44,916 --> 00:54:46,625
That's why you mustn't ever leave.

718
00:54:47,916 --> 00:54:50,083
Who knows what you'll become if you go.

719
00:54:50,166 --> 00:54:51,625
What will I become if I stay?

720
00:54:51,708 --> 00:54:54,791
Nothing. Just be you. Like me.

721
00:54:57,750 --> 00:54:59,666
I really thought you'd be happy here.

722
00:55:01,083 --> 00:55:02,208
Yes, I did too.

723
00:55:03,416 --> 00:55:06,583
But Neverland is not exactly
what I was expecting.

724
00:55:08,541 --> 00:55:11,208
Peter, it's so much more real.

725
00:55:11,291 --> 00:55:15,041
Of course it's real.
It's just a different real.

726
00:55:15,708 --> 00:55:16,708
A better real.

727
00:55:18,583 --> 00:55:20,583
-Peter...
-Goodnight, Wendy.

728
00:55:44,458 --> 00:55:45,458
Mr. Bear.

729
00:56:00,291 --> 00:56:04,083
Wendy Moira Angela Darling.

730
00:56:08,041 --> 00:56:10,208
The little sing-song girl

731
00:56:11,541 --> 00:56:13,166
of London, England.

732
00:56:15,666 --> 00:56:19,500
Your voice drew me back to my old home.

733
00:56:22,291 --> 00:56:23,291
Thank you.

734
00:57:13,666 --> 00:57:14,750
Got you!

735
00:57:22,833 --> 00:57:24,208
Where are you?

736
00:57:29,958 --> 00:57:35,875
How many times did we play hide-and-seek
in these ruins?

737
00:57:39,666 --> 00:57:41,458
You were always the best at hiding.

738
00:57:45,750 --> 00:57:46,750
Then again...

739
00:57:47,500 --> 00:57:49,000
I was always the best...

740
00:57:51,250 --> 00:57:53,125
at finding you!

741
00:57:58,583 --> 00:57:59,583
Captain Hook?

742
00:58:01,125 --> 00:58:02,125
Yes.

743
00:58:04,375 --> 00:58:05,916
I don't think I like this adventure.

744
00:58:33,500 --> 00:58:34,500
Peter!

745
00:58:35,125 --> 00:58:36,125
Peter!

746
00:58:36,791 --> 00:58:38,000
No!

747
00:58:43,083 --> 00:58:44,625
What have you done?

748
00:58:48,291 --> 00:58:49,291
I've done it.

749
00:58:49,375 --> 00:58:50,375
Peter!

750
00:58:51,875 --> 00:58:53,666
I've killed Peter Pan.

751
01:00:37,916 --> 01:00:39,250
I want a word...

752
01:00:40,166 --> 01:00:41,250
with...

753
01:00:41,916 --> 01:00:42,916
you!

754
01:00:49,333 --> 01:00:51,708
-I have nothing to say to you.
-Then listen.

755
01:01:17,166 --> 01:01:18,166
What is that?

756
01:01:19,250 --> 01:01:21,166
Yeah, it's simply...
That's just a lullaby.

757
01:01:21,250 --> 01:01:23,583
Yes, but why...

758
01:01:24,750 --> 01:01:27,250
does it remind me of something?

759
01:01:30,416 --> 01:01:32,250
-Open this!
-Yes.

760
01:01:33,250 --> 01:01:34,916
Where are the keys? Keys. Keys. Keys.

761
01:01:35,000 --> 01:01:37,666
Where does it come from? Tell me.

762
01:01:37,750 --> 01:01:39,375
-I don't know.
-Tell me!

763
01:01:41,125 --> 01:01:43,500
Why does it make me feel so...

764
01:01:44,375 --> 01:01:45,708
I couldn't say.

765
01:01:45,791 --> 01:01:47,875
It was just something my mother sings us.

766
01:01:47,958 --> 01:01:48,958
Your who?

767
01:01:50,125 --> 01:01:51,125
My mother.

768
01:01:59,625 --> 01:02:00,708
Yes, of course.

769
01:02:14,708 --> 01:02:17,416
I know you weren't always like this,
Captain Hook.

770
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:21,791
I know you and Peter were friends.

771
01:02:23,000 --> 01:02:24,500
I've heard stories.

772
01:02:25,583 --> 01:02:26,666
Have you?

773
01:02:27,458 --> 01:02:28,541
You left Neverland.

774
01:02:29,875 --> 01:02:31,708
And when you returned, you were...

775
01:02:31,791 --> 01:02:32,833
Evil.

776
01:02:35,708 --> 01:02:36,708
Yes.

777
01:02:36,791 --> 01:02:37,833
Hmm.

778
01:02:40,583 --> 01:02:42,000
There's truth to that.

779
01:02:47,500 --> 01:02:49,500
But he left out the most important part.

780
01:02:52,500 --> 01:02:54,083
I didn't just leave Neverland.

781
01:02:58,458 --> 01:02:59,666
Peter made you go.

782
01:03:00,416 --> 01:03:01,416
There it is.

783
01:03:03,166 --> 01:03:04,625
There's the sticking point.

784
01:03:07,000 --> 01:03:09,791
My once and best friend banished me,

785
01:03:09,875 --> 01:03:11,458
all because I missed my...

786
01:03:19,958 --> 01:03:21,958
I... missed...

787
01:03:27,375 --> 01:03:28,375
my...

788
01:03:43,291 --> 01:03:44,291
Your mother?

789
01:03:44,375 --> 01:03:46,375
Yes, my mother.

790
01:03:50,041 --> 01:03:51,875
Who sang me that very song.

791
01:03:54,458 --> 01:03:55,875
Is it so terrible a thing,

792
01:03:57,500 --> 01:03:58,500
to miss a mother?

793
01:03:58,583 --> 01:04:00,916
No, of course, it's not.

794
01:04:01,000 --> 01:04:03,375
Tell that to your dearly departed friend,

795
01:04:04,416 --> 01:04:06,083
for he surely thought otherwise.

796
01:04:09,083 --> 01:04:11,750
And do you know, after all that,
I never did find her.

797
01:04:12,458 --> 01:04:13,875
I never made it home.

798
01:04:13,958 --> 01:04:17,791
I never saw my poor,
sweet mama, ever again.

799
01:04:20,416 --> 01:04:23,833
I left Neverland and I was lost at sea.

800
01:04:27,333 --> 01:04:28,625
I'd have surely perished,

801
01:04:30,541 --> 01:04:32,541
were I not saved by this man here.

802
01:04:34,250 --> 01:04:38,791
There I was, rescued
and raised by pirates.

803
01:04:40,416 --> 01:04:42,333
And by-and-by, I became their Captain

804
01:04:42,416 --> 01:04:47,208
and I, in-turn brought them
right back here.

805
01:04:47,833 --> 01:04:48,833
But why?

806
01:04:50,375 --> 01:04:52,875
Why come back at all,
if Peter hurt you so?

807
01:04:52,958 --> 01:04:54,375
Because he was my friend.

808
01:04:56,666 --> 01:04:57,708
I'd been happy here.

809
01:04:57,791 --> 01:05:00,000
-You could be happy again.
-No.

810
01:05:00,083 --> 01:05:02,333
My time for joy is lost.

811
01:05:02,875 --> 01:05:07,875
Everything I could have been
has been reduced to this.

812
01:05:10,125 --> 01:05:11,125
This...

813
01:05:17,458 --> 01:05:19,000
is what growing up looks like.

814
01:05:20,041 --> 01:05:21,041
No.

815
01:05:21,833 --> 01:05:24,416
This is what it looks like,
when you grow up wrong.

816
01:05:29,125 --> 01:05:31,833
You find me a child
who truly knows the difference

817
01:05:31,916 --> 01:05:33,625
between right and wrong.

818
01:05:35,458 --> 01:05:37,708
And I'll show you a man

819
01:05:39,666 --> 01:05:42,500
who can't remember
why it mattered in the first place.

820
01:05:46,583 --> 01:05:49,000
Execute every last one of them.

821
01:05:56,416 --> 01:05:58,166
- No! Wait! Stop!
- Come here!

822
01:05:58,791 --> 01:05:59,833
Guilty!

823
01:05:59,916 --> 01:06:02,916
-James, don't you think that...
-Never call me that!

824
01:06:05,000 --> 01:06:09,000
I am Captain Hook.

825
01:06:09,875 --> 01:06:11,958
Please stop! Take me.

826
01:06:13,750 --> 01:06:15,500
Take me instead!

827
01:06:16,791 --> 01:06:18,791
They're only children, let them live.

828
01:06:21,041 --> 01:06:23,250
When they grow up,
they'll be good pirates,

829
01:06:23,958 --> 01:06:25,166
especially those two.

830
01:06:25,791 --> 01:06:27,041
Please take me.

831
01:06:29,833 --> 01:06:32,458
Your largesse is admirable.

832
01:06:34,916 --> 01:06:36,916
Perhaps it'll lead to a bigger splash.

833
01:06:39,541 --> 01:06:40,791
No! Wendy! No!

834
01:06:42,291 --> 01:06:44,291
Wendy! No! Wendy!

835
01:06:45,291 --> 01:06:46,500
John, I'm sorry.

836
01:06:48,125 --> 01:06:49,250
No, Wendy!

837
01:07:16,666 --> 01:07:17,666
Puhkitinin kguh weechitdaan.

838
01:07:17,750 --> 01:07:19,291
Where is everyone? Where's Tink?

839
01:07:20,041 --> 01:07:21,208
Where are my Lost Boys?

840
01:07:23,333 --> 01:07:24,500
They were taken.

841
01:07:25,541 --> 01:07:26,583
By Hook?

842
01:07:51,791 --> 01:07:52,916
Let me help you.

843
01:08:20,791 --> 01:08:24,625
A route unravels where those who travel

844
01:08:24,708 --> 01:08:29,708
Don't return from the Earth

845
01:08:29,791 --> 01:08:34,625
So take a hop tiny, and bob on the briny

846
01:08:34,708 --> 01:08:39,916
Seek the shore, forever more

847
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:43,416
Fair winds

848
01:08:43,500 --> 01:08:48,791
And following seas

849
01:08:49,458 --> 01:08:54,541
Elude alligator, confront the creator

850
01:08:54,625 --> 01:09:00,291
Thine eyes shall see, the mystery

851
01:09:00,375 --> 01:09:04,250
Fair winds

852
01:09:04,333 --> 01:09:10,333
And following seas

853
01:09:10,916 --> 01:09:15,125
And as you sink deeper
and stare at the reaper

854
01:09:15,208 --> 01:09:19,875
Who waits on the tongues of leviathans

855
01:09:19,958 --> 01:09:24,500
And there's a lot of 'em,
you won't touch the bottom

856
01:09:24,583 --> 01:09:29,708
And as we suggested,
you're slowly digested

857
01:09:29,791 --> 01:09:33,291
Fish food

858
01:09:33,375 --> 01:09:38,375
And following sea

859
01:09:43,041 --> 01:09:44,041
Farewell then.

860
01:09:46,291 --> 01:09:50,208
Wendy Moira Angela Darling.

861
01:09:51,375 --> 01:09:56,333
Into the water, no son or daughters

862
01:09:56,416 --> 01:10:01,833
Escapes the drink, they'll certainly sink

863
01:10:02,125 --> 01:10:06,083
Fair winds

864
01:10:06,166 --> 01:10:12,583
And following seas

865
01:10:12,666 --> 01:10:14,250
Fair winds

866
01:10:14,333 --> 01:10:16,208
Think happy thoughts.

867
01:11:05,416 --> 01:11:06,416
Mr. Smee.

868
01:11:08,458 --> 01:11:09,666
Mr. Smee.

869
01:11:11,458 --> 01:11:13,666
Yes, yes, sir. Yes, sir.

870
01:11:15,125 --> 01:11:18,041
-Did you hear a splash?
-Absolutely, Captain.

871
01:11:18,125 --> 01:11:19,125
It was, uh...

872
01:11:21,541 --> 01:11:23,875
- Actually...
- I didn't hear one.

873
01:11:24,333 --> 01:11:25,458
Nor I.

874
01:11:25,541 --> 01:11:27,375
But I'm sure one's coming.

875
01:11:33,125 --> 01:11:35,250
Well, she surely must have
hit the water by now.

876
01:11:35,333 --> 01:11:38,416
Unless she fell very slowly.

877
01:11:41,541 --> 01:11:44,916
Did anyone hear a splash?

878
01:11:45,000 --> 01:11:46,416
- Was there a splash?
- Mmm-mmm.

879
01:12:23,083 --> 01:12:24,708
Why that looks like...

880
01:12:35,208 --> 01:12:36,916
- Wendy!
- Wendy!

881
01:12:37,916 --> 01:12:39,250
You have the boy's magic.

882
01:12:40,166 --> 01:12:42,875
No. This magic belongs to no boy.

883
01:12:46,166 --> 01:12:47,958
We still have you outnumbered, girl.

884
01:12:48,416 --> 01:12:50,166
Hand over hook over fist.

885
01:12:51,458 --> 01:12:55,708
My men would lay down their lives
for their captain.

886
01:12:56,541 --> 01:12:57,541
Yes.

887
01:12:58,291 --> 01:13:01,208
But what's a captain without his ship?

888
01:13:26,041 --> 01:13:27,958
Smee!

889
01:13:29,916 --> 01:13:31,375
-Mr. Smee.
-Yes, Cap.

890
01:13:32,333 --> 01:13:34,208
Get my ship back in the water.

891
01:13:36,750 --> 01:13:39,458
-Hands on the wheel!
-Hand on the wheel!

892
01:13:39,541 --> 01:13:41,708
Drop the anchor! Make it fast!

893
01:13:51,208 --> 01:13:52,208
Is that?

894
01:13:52,291 --> 01:13:54,166
-I think it might be.
-It couldn't be!

895
01:13:56,250 --> 01:13:57,250
But it definitely is.

896
01:14:08,041 --> 01:14:09,250
-Peter!
-Peter!

897
01:14:09,333 --> 01:14:10,708
-Peter!
-Pan!

898
01:14:28,666 --> 01:14:29,666
Miss me?

899
01:14:31,125 --> 01:14:32,666
More than you'll ever know.

900
01:14:35,375 --> 01:14:37,916
Well, wake me up
if one of them kills the other.

901
01:14:38,000 --> 01:14:39,000
Again.

902
01:14:43,708 --> 01:14:45,208
How did you do it, boy?

903
01:14:47,000 --> 01:14:48,541
How did you survive?

904
01:14:50,791 --> 01:14:52,791
Faith, trust and pixie dust?

905
01:14:52,875 --> 01:14:53,875
No.

906
01:14:54,500 --> 01:14:55,833
No pixie dust this time.

907
01:14:55,916 --> 01:14:56,916
No magic.

908
01:14:57,833 --> 01:14:58,833
No tricks.

909
01:15:00,166 --> 01:15:01,875
Just a little help from my friends.

910
01:15:03,083 --> 01:15:05,083
You dare to speak to me of friends

911
01:15:06,208 --> 01:15:08,833
when all of yours now belong to me?

912
01:15:13,708 --> 01:15:14,958
Proud...

913
01:15:16,458 --> 01:15:18,083
and insolent youth,

914
01:15:21,166 --> 01:15:22,416
raise your sword.

915
01:15:24,250 --> 01:15:25,500
Sad and sinister man,

916
01:15:28,916 --> 01:15:29,916
one last time.

917
01:15:48,916 --> 01:15:50,625
Oh!

918
01:16:06,250 --> 01:16:07,458
Get off!

919
01:16:09,416 --> 01:16:10,541
Get the children!

920
01:16:11,541 --> 01:16:12,916
Get the pirates!

921
01:16:18,250 --> 01:16:19,666
- I've got the bear!
- Hey!

922
01:16:19,750 --> 01:16:21,000
The bear is mine!

923
01:16:21,833 --> 01:16:24,041
Give me back my bear!

924
01:16:33,333 --> 01:16:35,166
Give it back!

925
01:16:35,250 --> 01:16:37,125
Don't touch my brother!

926
01:16:37,500 --> 01:16:38,916
Or his bear!

927
01:17:04,833 --> 01:17:05,833
Uhh!

928
01:17:33,708 --> 01:17:34,958
Just like old times.

929
01:17:35,791 --> 01:17:38,583
All your times are old, Captain.

930
01:17:58,583 --> 01:17:59,583
Upon him!

931
01:18:08,708 --> 01:18:10,166
Michael, come on.

932
01:18:41,125 --> 01:18:43,250
-Uhh!
-Almost there.

933
01:18:48,750 --> 01:18:49,958
Oh. That was close.

934
01:18:50,041 --> 01:18:52,458
Kids, give me that wheel.

935
01:18:54,916 --> 01:18:55,916
Wendy!

936
01:18:57,208 --> 01:18:58,208
Help!

937
01:18:59,958 --> 01:19:00,958
The helm!

938
01:19:20,666 --> 01:19:23,041
Right, John, Michael,
hang on to something.

939
01:19:23,125 --> 01:19:24,791
Everyone, hang on!

940
01:19:30,166 --> 01:19:31,333
Three!

941
01:19:32,291 --> 01:19:33,333
Two!

942
01:19:36,000 --> 01:19:37,000
One.

943
01:20:24,125 --> 01:20:27,875
Whoa! Whoo-hoo!

944
01:20:40,291 --> 01:20:41,875
Hang on, Peter!

945
01:20:41,958 --> 01:20:43,041
Don't look down.

946
01:20:43,125 --> 01:20:44,458
Peter, no! No, hang on!

947
01:20:45,041 --> 01:20:46,041
Don't let go.

948
01:20:46,541 --> 01:20:47,625
Peter!

949
01:21:12,041 --> 01:21:15,208
Do you know, what really hurts

950
01:21:16,625 --> 01:21:18,166
about getting old?

951
01:21:18,916 --> 01:21:22,333
It's not the creaking bones

952
01:21:24,416 --> 01:21:25,791
or the dashed dreams

953
01:21:26,666 --> 01:21:30,291
or even the sense of death

954
01:21:31,625 --> 01:21:32,833
drawing ever the nearer.

955
01:21:34,166 --> 01:21:37,416
It's knowing your best friend
can stare you in the eyes

956
01:21:37,500 --> 01:21:39,083
and not recognize you.

957
01:21:39,166 --> 01:21:41,375
-You're the one who wanted to leave.
-I was a child!

958
01:21:44,375 --> 01:21:45,458
Wait, stop!

959
01:22:05,541 --> 01:22:06,625
Go ahead, boy.

960
01:22:07,541 --> 01:22:08,541
Go ahead.

961
01:22:10,041 --> 01:22:13,541
But imagine a Neverland
without the two of us.

962
01:22:15,333 --> 01:22:16,666
Without our battles.

963
01:22:17,583 --> 01:22:18,791
Our brawls.

964
01:22:21,000 --> 01:22:22,000
I know

965
01:22:23,666 --> 01:22:24,916
without you

966
01:22:26,500 --> 01:22:30,291
the fire that fuels me will go out.

967
01:22:31,291 --> 01:22:32,291
Without me,

968
01:22:33,291 --> 01:22:35,291
you'd have no choice but to...

969
01:22:35,375 --> 01:22:37,375
-Be a real boy?
-No.

970
01:22:38,958 --> 01:22:41,250
No. A real boy would have to grow.

971
01:22:41,333 --> 01:22:42,625
A real boy...

972
01:22:42,708 --> 01:22:43,833
Would apologize.

973
01:22:43,916 --> 01:22:45,791
Apologize?

974
01:22:48,583 --> 01:22:49,583
For what?

975
01:22:50,333 --> 01:22:51,333
For hurting you.

976
01:22:53,583 --> 01:22:54,791
For being a rotten friend.

977
01:23:03,583 --> 01:23:05,666
I'm sorry I did what I did, Captain Hook.

978
01:23:07,583 --> 01:23:09,208
I'm sorry I hurt you, James.

979
01:23:11,833 --> 01:23:13,125
You don't get to do that.

980
01:23:16,000 --> 01:23:17,500
No, that's not how this works.

981
01:23:19,041 --> 01:23:20,458
I want you to fight.

982
01:23:21,375 --> 01:23:23,750
-I need you to fight.
-This isn't fun anymore.

983
01:23:23,833 --> 01:23:26,416
It's not supposed to be fun!

984
01:23:27,000 --> 01:23:28,125
Oh, Captain.

985
01:23:30,083 --> 01:23:31,250
Grow up.

986
01:23:38,458 --> 01:23:39,583
Got you.

987
01:23:39,875 --> 01:23:40,875
Don't worry, James.

988
01:23:40,958 --> 01:23:42,000
Oh.

989
01:23:42,083 --> 01:23:43,375
Just think happy thoughts.

990
01:23:52,791 --> 01:23:53,791
Peter.

991
01:23:57,125 --> 01:23:58,541
I haven't got any.

992
01:24:40,833 --> 01:24:42,250
What's wrong, Peter?

993
01:24:44,750 --> 01:24:45,791
He was my friend.

994
01:24:47,333 --> 01:24:49,125
We're your friends, too, Peter.

995
01:24:49,208 --> 01:24:50,875
We're always on your side, Peter.

996
01:24:51,666 --> 01:24:52,958
I know.

997
01:24:54,416 --> 01:24:56,416
And I'm glad you are, but...

998
01:25:00,291 --> 01:25:01,291
Peter,

999
01:25:04,541 --> 01:25:07,208
don't you think it's time
we get these Lost Boys home?

1000
01:25:16,083 --> 01:25:17,625
Where to, Peter?

1001
01:25:17,708 --> 01:25:20,375
Second star to the right,
straight on till morning.

1002
01:25:21,000 --> 01:25:23,000
Wait, wouldn't it be left?

1003
01:25:23,750 --> 01:25:25,375
- What?
- The star.

1004
01:25:25,458 --> 01:25:28,583
- If we're going in the opposite direction.
- Oh, yes! That's right.

1005
01:25:28,666 --> 01:25:31,791
Yes. Yes, it's right.
Wait, we're going left, right?

1006
01:25:34,458 --> 01:25:37,041
No, no, no. People!
It has always been right, Twins?

1007
01:26:27,541 --> 01:26:28,541
Goodness, Wendy.

1008
01:26:29,166 --> 01:26:30,625
You gave me a fright.

1009
01:26:31,625 --> 01:26:33,333
Mother? I...

1010
01:26:35,375 --> 01:26:36,375
What is it?

1011
01:26:36,458 --> 01:26:37,875
I'm sorry.

1012
01:26:39,666 --> 01:26:43,250
Oh, there, there. Oh, sweet girl.

1013
01:26:43,333 --> 01:26:45,416
It's quite all right.

1014
01:26:46,000 --> 01:26:47,208
And I think I'm ready.

1015
01:26:47,291 --> 01:26:48,500
Ready for what?

1016
01:26:49,083 --> 01:26:50,375
I'm ready to grow...

1017
01:26:52,750 --> 01:26:54,083
Did you hear something?

1018
01:26:54,166 --> 01:26:55,541
No, I didn't hear anything.

1019
01:26:55,625 --> 01:26:57,875
- What on Earth?
- I think it was just a...

1020
01:26:58,416 --> 01:27:00,041
- What's that commotion?
- Nothing.

1021
01:27:00,125 --> 01:27:02,500
-Father, I heard something, too.
-Intruders.

1022
01:27:02,583 --> 01:27:04,083
There are no intruders.

1023
01:27:04,166 --> 01:27:07,000
No, Father, Mother,
I have something to explain to you.

1024
01:27:07,083 --> 01:27:08,916
- Stay out here.
- No, don't go in.

1025
01:27:09,000 --> 01:27:11,000
Oh, no, be careful with that! No!

1026
01:27:11,083 --> 01:27:13,375
That was a present
from my Uncle John and Auntie Ang.

1027
01:27:13,458 --> 01:27:15,458
Please, please, please, careful. Just...

1028
01:27:21,500 --> 01:27:23,500
Who are all these children?

1029
01:27:25,625 --> 01:27:27,208
Mother.

1030
01:27:33,625 --> 01:27:35,208
Uh-uh...

1031
01:27:35,291 --> 01:27:36,958
Where on Earth did you come from?

1032
01:27:37,041 --> 01:27:39,291
They came from Neverland, Father.

1033
01:27:39,875 --> 01:27:40,875
Never-where?

1034
01:27:52,541 --> 01:27:53,541
Boy,

1035
01:27:55,083 --> 01:27:56,375
why are you crying?

1036
01:27:57,958 --> 01:28:00,125
You know how you asked me
where I came from?

1037
01:28:01,916 --> 01:28:02,916
Yes.

1038
01:28:15,416 --> 01:28:17,833
- This was your home?
- It was, once.

1039
01:28:19,041 --> 01:28:20,625
My mother scolded me one night

1040
01:28:21,916 --> 01:28:23,208
and told me to grow up.

1041
01:28:24,708 --> 01:28:27,333
Instead, I climbed out of the window,

1042
01:28:27,416 --> 01:28:28,833
leapt over the garden wall,

1043
01:28:30,458 --> 01:28:31,583
and never looked back.

1044
01:28:32,791 --> 01:28:34,041
Except you did.

1045
01:28:36,708 --> 01:28:39,625
That's why you kept coming back, isn't it?

1046
01:28:40,500 --> 01:28:44,875
Because you miss your home.
And you miss...

1047
01:28:47,125 --> 01:28:48,208
My mother.

1048
01:28:50,541 --> 01:28:51,791
But she's long gone now.

1049
01:28:53,333 --> 01:28:54,333
I'm just a story.

1050
01:28:55,291 --> 01:28:57,625
A story told to any child who'd listen.

1051
01:28:59,333 --> 01:29:01,500
It never had an ending, until now.

1052
01:29:03,791 --> 01:29:06,583
Maybe I could still come back
to listen to it sometimes.

1053
01:29:09,666 --> 01:29:10,916
Or you could stay.

1054
01:29:11,750 --> 01:29:12,750
Here?

1055
01:29:12,833 --> 01:29:13,833
Yes.

1056
01:29:15,333 --> 01:29:17,708
But you're going to leave.
Going to grow up.

1057
01:29:19,041 --> 01:29:20,083
You know, Peter.

1058
01:29:22,666 --> 01:29:26,208
After all this, I think that to grow up...

1059
01:29:27,791 --> 01:29:31,250
Why, it might just be
the biggest adventure of all.

1060
01:29:33,291 --> 01:29:36,291
Just think of all the things
that could be right around the corner

1061
01:29:36,375 --> 01:29:37,916
that you're missing out on.

1062
01:29:39,291 --> 01:29:44,125
Think of what the world is missing out on
with you not being there to do them.

1063
01:29:50,125 --> 01:29:51,333
I don't think I'm ready.

1064
01:30:05,125 --> 01:30:06,208
No, wait! Peter!

1065
01:30:09,708 --> 01:30:10,916
Don't go.

1066
01:30:17,125 --> 01:30:18,500
What sort of magic is this?

1067
01:30:22,375 --> 01:30:23,583
Who's that boy?

1068
01:30:24,958 --> 01:30:26,791
Why, that's Peter Pan.

1069
01:30:29,500 --> 01:30:30,500
Goodbye, Tink.

1070
01:30:32,250 --> 01:30:34,333
You take care of Peter

1071
01:30:35,583 --> 01:30:37,250
and please don't forget about me.

1072
01:30:39,125 --> 01:30:40,208
I could never.

1073
01:30:43,125 --> 01:30:47,625
Wendy, thank you for hearing me.

1074
01:31:14,916 --> 01:31:15,916
Goodbye, Peter Pan.

1075
01:31:16,750 --> 01:31:18,500
Goodbye, Peter Pan!

1076
01:32:30,416 --> 01:32:33,041
Did you see me, Cap?

1077
01:32:33,750 --> 01:32:35,041
I'm still alive!

1078
01:32:35,125 --> 01:32:36,916
-I didn't drown!
-Do you hear that?

1079
01:32:37,000 --> 01:32:38,000
I'm floating!

1080
01:32:38,166 --> 01:32:40,000
-Look at us, we're floating.
-Did you hear that?

1081
01:32:42,416 --> 01:32:43,416
The gulls?

1082
01:32:43,500 --> 01:32:44,500
No!

1083
01:32:45,250 --> 01:32:46,250
Crocodile?

1084
01:32:46,583 --> 01:32:47,583
No!

1085
01:32:49,000 --> 01:32:50,000
What then?

1086
01:36:13,416 --> 01:36:19,625
It's time to drift away, my loves

1087
01:36:20,916 --> 01:36:27,875
And dream of cooing turtle doves

1088
01:36:28,166 --> 01:36:34,583
For when I turn to switch the light

1089
01:36:34,666 --> 01:36:41,208
I know you'll grow up overnight

1090
01:36:43,041 --> 01:36:49,541
Fly off into the cloudless skies

1091
01:36:49,625 --> 01:36:56,000
Where twinkling stars will fill your eyes

1092
01:36:57,250 --> 01:37:01,291
I'll miss you dearly

1093
01:37:01,625 --> 01:37:04,708
My brave little ones

1094
01:37:06,166 --> 01:37:13,083
All grown up now in the morning sun

1095
01:42:29,583 --> 01:42:31,625
Heave ho

1096
01:42:31,708 --> 01:42:33,041
Heave ho

1097
01:42:33,166 --> 01:42:36,291
Oh oh dark and quiet
are the devils in the deep

1098
01:42:36,375 --> 01:42:38,666
So slow and silent
So you're swallowed in your sleep

1099
01:42:38,875 --> 01:42:41,125
With a tail and a tooth
And I'm telling you the truth

1100
01:42:41,208 --> 01:42:43,666
You'll be boiling in the belly
Of a behemoth

1101
01:42:43,916 --> 01:42:48,083
Set sail with your sights abroad
And suddenly the suction of a cephalopod

1102
01:42:48,208 --> 01:42:53,250
Has you thinking twice take my advice
A mutineer should also fear a firing squad
