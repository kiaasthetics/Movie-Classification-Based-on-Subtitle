00:00:11,094 --> 00:00:14,098
# Whoa #

2
00:00:17,351 --> 00:00:20,196
# Whoa #

3
00:00:23,607 --> 00:00:26,156
# Whoa #

4
00:00:29,863 --> 00:00:32,457
# Whoa #

5
00:00:35,994 --> 00:00:38,122
# Whoa #

6
00:00:42,376 --> 00:00:44,219
# Whoa #

7
00:00:48,507 --> 00:00:50,931
# Whoa #

8
00:00:51,468 --> 00:00:54,722
# Ladies and gents,
this is the moment you've waited for #

9
00:00:54,805 --> 00:00:57,269
# Whoa #

10
00:00:57,349 --> 00:00:59,062
# You been searchin' in the dark #

11
00:00:59,142 --> 00:01:00,981
# Your sweat soakin' through the floor #

12
00:01:01,061 --> 00:01:03,650
# Whoa #

13
00:01:03,730 --> 00:01:05,152
# And buried in your bones #

14
00:01:05,232 --> 00:01:07,109
# There's an ache that you can't ignore #

15
00:01:07,192 --> 00:01:08,530
# Takin' your breath #

16
00:01:08,610 --> 00:01:10,032
# Stealin' your mind #

17
00:01:10,112 --> 00:01:13,742
# And all that was real is left behind #

18
00:01:13,824 --> 00:01:16,872
# Don't fight it,
it's comin' for you, runnin' atcha #

19
00:01:16,952 --> 00:01:18,499
# It's only this moment #

20
00:01:18,579 --> 00:01:20,042
# Don't care what comes after #

21
00:01:20,122 --> 00:01:21,960
# Your fever dream, can't you see #

22
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:23,167
# Gettin' closer #

23
00:01:23,250 --> 00:01:26,298
# Just surrender 'cause you feel
the feelin' takin' over #

24
00:01:26,378 --> 00:01:29,426
# It's fire, it's freedom,
it's floodin' open #

25
00:01:29,506 --> 00:01:31,008
# It's the preacher in the pulpit #

26
00:01:31,091 --> 00:01:32,468
# And your blind devotion #

27
00:01:32,551 --> 00:01:34,053
# There's somethin' breakin' at the brick #

28
00:01:34,136 --> 00:01:36,808
# Of ev'ry wall that's holdin'
all that you know #

29
00:01:36,888 --> 00:01:39,436
# So tell me do you wanna go #

30
00:01:39,516 --> 00:01:42,606
# Where it's covered
in all the colored lights? #

31
00:01:42,686 --> 00:01:45,064
# Where the runaways are runnin' the night? #

32
00:01:45,147 --> 00:01:48,401
# Impossible comes true,
it's takin' over you #

33
00:01:48,483 --> 00:01:51,362
# Oh! This is the greatest show! #

34
00:01:51,445 --> 00:01:54,618
# We light it up, we won't come down #

35
00:01:54,698 --> 00:01:57,452
# And the sun can't stop us now #

36
00:01:57,534 --> 00:02:00,538
# Watchin' it come true,
it's takin' over you #

37
00:02:00,621 --> 00:02:04,000
# Oh! This is the greatest show! #

38
00:02:04,082 --> 00:02:07,086
# It's ev'rything you ever want #

39
00:02:07,169 --> 00:02:09,841
# It's ev'rything you ever need #

40
00:02:09,921 --> 00:02:12,594
# And it's here right in front of you #

41
00:02:12,674 --> 00:02:15,928
# This is where you wanna be #

42
00:02:16,011 --> 00:02:19,015
# It's ev'rything you ever want #

43
00:02:19,097 --> 00:02:22,020
# It's ev'rything you ever need #

44
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:25,148
# And it's here right in front of you #

45
00:02:25,228 --> 00:02:28,482
# This is where you wanna be #

46
00:02:28,565 --> 00:02:31,444
# It's ev'rything you ever want #

47
00:02:31,526 --> 00:02:34,575
# It's ev'rything you ever need #

48
00:02:34,655 --> 00:02:38,745
# And it's here right in front of you #

49
00:02:38,825 --> 00:02:41,374
# This is where you wanna be #

50
00:02:42,537 --> 00:02:45,040
# It's ev'rything you ever want #

51
00:02:46,333 --> 00:02:49,923
# It's ev'rything you ever need #

52
00:02:50,003 --> 00:02:53,303
# And it's here right in front of you #

53
00:02:56,593 --> 00:02:58,682
I understand, yes.
Thank you so much, Mr. Jeffries.

54
00:02:58,762 --> 00:03:00,639
Thank you. You'll have
the money by the end of the day.

55
00:03:03,475 --> 00:03:04,351
Let's go.

56
00:03:06,728 --> 00:03:09,072
Phineas, hurry up.
We're gonna miss the train.

57
00:03:15,779 --> 00:03:16,951
Stand up straight.

58
00:03:18,824 --> 00:03:21,122
Wipe that muck off.

59
00:03:24,037 --> 00:03:25,255
Pinkie up.

60
00:03:27,541 --> 00:03:29,418
Arm extended, elbow out.

61
00:03:32,087 --> 00:03:33,680
Sip, never slurp.

62
00:03:38,051 --> 00:03:41,271
Pinkie in the air, arm extended...

63
00:03:41,638 --> 00:03:42,810
elbow out.

64
00:03:43,849 --> 00:03:45,192
Keep your cup level.

65
00:03:46,184 --> 00:03:48,278
Gently lower your cup.

66
00:03:49,187 --> 00:03:50,905
Shall we do it again?

67
00:03:51,606 --> 00:03:52,607
Pinkie in the air...

68
00:03:53,942 --> 00:03:56,411
arm extended, elbow out.

69
00:03:57,154 --> 00:03:58,872
Gracefully.

70
00:04:03,994 --> 00:04:05,041
Charity, come here.

71
00:04:14,838 --> 00:04:16,090
Your dress.

72
00:04:17,007 --> 00:04:19,010
Is this how we've taught you to behave?

73
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:21,352
It's my fault, sir.

74
00:04:23,346 --> 00:04:24,598
I made her laugh.

75
00:04:24,681 --> 00:04:26,979
Well, thank you for your honesty.

76
00:04:30,061 --> 00:04:31,438
Stay away from my daughter.

77
00:04:54,586 --> 00:04:55,804
How'd you get out?

78
00:04:56,463 --> 00:04:57,430
The window.

79
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:02,348
Father is sending me to finishing school.

80
00:05:03,887 --> 00:05:05,855
I don't know what my future will be.

81
00:05:07,349 --> 00:05:08,396
I do.

82
00:05:10,477 --> 00:05:13,692
# I close my eyes and I can see #

83
00:05:13,772 --> 00:05:17,612
# A world that's waiting up for me #

84
00:05:17,692 --> 00:05:21,117
# That I call my own #

85
00:05:23,949 --> 00:05:27,164
# Through the dark, through the door #

86
00:05:27,244 --> 00:05:31,084
# Through where no one's been before #

87
00:05:31,164 --> 00:05:33,792
# But it feels like home #

88
00:05:36,753 --> 00:05:38,341
# They can say, they can say #

89
00:05:38,421 --> 00:05:41,391
# It all sounds crazy #

90
00:05:42,759 --> 00:05:47,765
# They can say, they can say
I've lost my mind #

91
00:05:49,474 --> 00:05:51,351
# I don't care, I don't care #

92
00:05:51,434 --> 00:05:55,029
# So call me crazy #

93
00:05:55,730 --> 00:06:00,236
# We can live in a world that we design #

94
00:06:02,487 --> 00:06:05,327
# 'Cause ev'ry night I lie in bed #

95
00:06:05,407 --> 00:06:08,786
# The brightest colors fill my head #

96
00:06:08,869 --> 00:06:10,040
# A million dreams #

97
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:14,842
# Are keepin' me awake #

98
00:06:15,083 --> 00:06:18,381
# I think of what the world could be #

99
00:06:18,461 --> 00:06:21,384
# A vision of the one I see #

100
00:06:21,464 --> 00:06:27,766
# A million dreams is all it's gonna take #

101
00:06:27,846 --> 00:06:29,559
# Oh, a million dreams #

102
00:06:29,639 --> 00:06:31,642
# For the world we're gonna make #

103
00:06:39,190 --> 00:06:40,904
# They can say, they can say #

104
00:06:40,984 --> 00:06:44,830
# It all sounds crazy #

105
00:06:45,363 --> 00:06:47,452
# They can say, they can say #

106
00:06:47,532 --> 00:06:49,246
- Enough!
- # We've lost our minds #

107
00:06:49,326 --> 00:06:50,293
Charity!

108
00:06:52,037 --> 00:06:53,914
# I don't care, I don't care #

109
00:06:53,997 --> 00:06:57,126
# If they call us crazy #

110
00:06:58,376 --> 00:07:04,759
# Run away to a world that we design #

111
00:07:04,841 --> 00:07:07,595
# 'Cause ev'ry night I lie in bed #

112
00:07:07,677 --> 00:07:10,931
# The brightest colors fill my head #

113
00:07:11,014 --> 00:07:17,566
# A million dreams are keepin' me awake #

114
00:07:17,646 --> 00:07:19,985
# I think of what the world could be #

115
00:07:20,065 --> 00:07:20,941
Hey!

116
00:07:21,024 --> 00:07:23,989
# A vision of the one I see #

117
00:07:24,069 --> 00:07:26,533
# A million dreams is all #

118
00:07:26,613 --> 00:07:30,368
- No!
- # It's gonna take #

119
00:07:30,450 --> 00:07:32,122
# Oh, a million dreams #

120
00:07:32,202 --> 00:07:34,671
# For the world we're gonna make #

121
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:53,724
Newspapers! Amazing stories
from around the world!

122
00:07:53,807 --> 00:07:56,435
# A million dreams are keepin' me #

123
00:07:56,518 --> 00:07:59,941
# Awake #

124
00:08:00,021 --> 00:08:03,320
# I think of what the world could be #

125
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:06,323
# A vision of the one I see #

126
00:08:06,403 --> 00:08:12,495
# A million dreams is all it's gonna take #

127
00:08:12,575 --> 00:08:14,077
# Oh, a million dreams #

128
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:17,585
# For the world we're gonna make #

129
00:08:20,083 --> 00:08:23,087
Come! Join the Great American Railroad!

130
00:08:23,169 --> 00:08:25,759
Three meals a day. Roof over your head.

131
00:08:25,839 --> 00:08:30,094
Fair and ample wages.
Come, make your fortune!

132
00:08:30,176 --> 00:08:32,390
See the open plains of America!

133
00:08:32,470 --> 00:08:35,940
Opportunity awaits you, sir,
out on the rails!

134
00:08:52,157 --> 00:08:53,204
Sir, I...

135
00:08:54,034 --> 00:08:55,752
I know I don't come from much, but...

136
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:58,458
I will take care of your daughter

137
00:08:58,538 --> 00:09:00,506
and I will give her a life
as grand as this one.

138
00:09:07,881 --> 00:09:09,349
Bye, Mother.

139
00:09:10,884 --> 00:09:12,011
She'll be back.

140
00:09:12,469 --> 00:09:15,268
Sooner or later, she'll tire of your life...

141
00:09:15,722 --> 00:09:17,060
of having nothing,

142
00:09:17,140 --> 00:09:18,812
and she'll come running back home.

143
00:09:28,568 --> 00:09:31,533
# Ev'ry night I lie in bed #

144
00:09:31,613 --> 00:09:34,953
# The brightest colors fill my head #

145
00:09:35,033 --> 00:09:41,084
# A million dreams are keepin' me awake #

146
00:09:41,164 --> 00:09:44,462
# I think of what the world could be #

# A million dreams is all it's gonna take #

149
00:09:54,010 --> 00:09:55,762
# Oh, a million dreams #

150
00:09:55,845 --> 00:09:57,893
# For the world we're gonna make #

151
00:09:59,099 --> 00:10:02,272
# However big, however small #

152
00:10:02,352 --> 00:10:06,482
# Let me be a part of it all #

153
00:10:06,564 --> 00:10:10,785
# Share your dreams with me #

154
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:15,285
# You may be right, you may be wrong #

155
00:10:15,365 --> 00:10:18,995
# But say that you'll bring me along #

156
00:10:19,077 --> 00:10:22,331
# To the world you see #

157
00:10:22,413 --> 00:10:26,543
# To the world I close my eyes to see #

158
00:10:26,626 --> 00:10:30,927
# I close my eyes to see #

159
00:10:32,257 --> 00:10:35,430
# Cause ev'ry night I lie in bed #

160
00:10:35,510 --> 00:10:38,639
# The brightest colors fill my head #

161
00:10:38,721 --> 00:10:42,601
# A million dreams are keepin' me awake #

162
00:10:42,684 --> 00:10:45,273
# A million dreams, a million dreams #

163
00:10:45,353 --> 00:10:48,482
# I think of what the world could be #

164
00:10:48,565 --> 00:10:51,694
# A vision of the one I see #

165
00:10:51,776 --> 00:10:58,244
# A million dreams is all it's gonna take #

166
00:10:58,324 --> 00:11:00,663
# A million dreams for the world #

167
00:11:00,743 --> 00:11:07,251
# We're gonna make #

168
00:11:09,252 --> 00:11:13,974
# For the world we're gonna make #

169
00:11:21,055 --> 00:11:22,182
- Mr. Smith?
- Yes.

170
00:11:22,265 --> 00:11:23,937
- Have a look at this.
- Of course.

171
00:11:42,285 --> 00:11:43,582
Yes, yes, I see it.

172
00:11:44,621 --> 00:11:46,123
Thank you, Chalmers, that'll do.

173
00:11:46,206 --> 00:11:48,334
Sir, Phineas Taylor Barnum.

174
00:11:48,416 --> 00:11:50,168
Uh, if I may, sir,

175
00:11:50,251 --> 00:11:52,003
I believe I have skills and ideas

176
00:11:52,086 --> 00:11:53,299
that go well beyond punching numbers

177
00:11:53,379 --> 00:11:54,425
into an adding machine.

178
00:11:54,505 --> 00:11:57,679
Well, I've read about this German fellow,
Lilienthal, I believe, who's developed

179
00:11:57,759 --> 00:12:00,137
a glider that can take a man in the air, sir.

180
00:12:00,220 --> 00:12:01,096
Isn't that amazing?

181
00:12:01,596 --> 00:12:03,473
I mean, if you were
to apply that to this business,

182
00:12:03,556 --> 00:12:05,354
- it would be revolutionary.
- Gentlemen!

183
00:12:05,850 --> 00:12:07,193
Can I have your attention?

184
00:12:08,019 --> 00:12:09,191
You're all dismissed.

185
00:12:10,855 --> 00:12:11,856
Bankrupt?

186
00:12:12,398 --> 00:12:14,275
I thought the company
had a dozen trading ships.

187
00:12:14,359 --> 00:12:16,236
Yes, at the bottom of the South China Sea.

188
00:12:16,986 --> 00:12:18,829
Typhoon sank 'em all.

189
00:12:56,776 --> 00:12:59,575
- Tag, you're it!
- Oh, you're in for it!

190
00:13:00,029 --> 00:13:01,781
- Hey.
- Oh, God!

191
00:13:02,365 --> 00:13:03,287
You're home early.

192
00:13:03,741 --> 00:13:05,209
And until further notice.

193
00:13:09,497 --> 00:13:11,336
Well, I didn't think
you were long for that job.

194
00:13:11,416 --> 00:13:12,759
Or any job, apparently.

195
00:13:13,918 --> 00:13:15,761
That's what makes our life
together so exciting.

196
00:13:16,337 --> 00:13:17,213
Charity.

197
00:13:21,092 --> 00:13:23,060
This isn't the life I promised you.

198
00:13:23,970 --> 00:13:25,558
But I have everything I want.

199
00:13:25,638 --> 00:13:26,765
What about the magic?

200
00:13:27,348 --> 00:13:28,937
What do you call those two girls?

201
00:13:31,894 --> 00:13:33,862
Hey, you partners, look who
moseyed into the corral.

202
00:13:35,773 --> 00:13:36,819
Daddy!

203
00:13:36,899 --> 00:13:38,401
- Come here!
- Did you bring a present?

204
00:13:38,484 --> 00:13:39,822
A present for what?

205
00:13:39,902 --> 00:13:41,616
- For my birthday!
- Your what?

206
00:13:41,696 --> 00:13:43,243
- My birthday.
- It's not your birthday.

207
00:13:44,324 --> 00:13:46,247
Okay, I do have a present...

208
00:13:46,868 --> 00:13:48,745
but not just any present. Oh, no.

209
00:13:49,412 --> 00:13:51,506
The most amazing birthday present ever.

210
00:13:52,999 --> 00:13:55,213
This extraordinary machine
was originally created

211
00:13:55,293 --> 00:13:57,840
by Leonardo da Vinci, 400 years ago.

212
00:13:57,920 --> 00:13:59,759
But the blueprints had been
lost for centuries

213
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:01,886
until just last week, on a stormy night,

214
00:14:01,966 --> 00:14:04,055
when a sunken pirate ship washed up

215
00:14:04,135 --> 00:14:05,807
on the shores of Nantucket.

216
00:14:05,887 --> 00:14:08,184
They found skeletons and treasures

217
00:14:08,264 --> 00:14:09,978
and the blueprints were recovered

218
00:14:10,058 --> 00:14:15,108
by none other than J.W. Mercantile.

219
00:14:15,188 --> 00:14:17,610
The blueprints crossed my desk very briefly

220
00:14:17,690 --> 00:14:19,567
but I managed to commit them to memory.

221
00:14:19,650 --> 00:14:23,120
And if I have remembered correctly...

222
00:14:30,495 --> 00:14:31,917
Happy birthday, Caroline.

223
00:14:39,587 --> 00:14:41,384
This is a wishing machine.

224
00:14:41,464 --> 00:14:43,216
You tell it your wishes...

225
00:14:44,717 --> 00:14:47,186
and it keeps them safe until they come true.

226
00:14:47,762 --> 00:14:50,811
Even if you forget them,
they're always there.

227
00:14:51,724 --> 00:14:52,600
Can I tell a wish?

228
00:14:52,683 --> 00:14:54,151
Step right up. Go ahead.

229
00:14:55,603 --> 00:14:58,482
I wish to marry Santa Claus.

230
00:14:58,564 --> 00:15:00,487
That is a good wish.

231
00:15:01,943 --> 00:15:02,819
I wish...

232
00:15:03,945 --> 00:15:05,663
for ballet slippers.

233
00:15:11,744 --> 00:15:13,542
Hey, that's... that's a good wish, too.

234
00:15:14,539 --> 00:15:16,007
What's your wish, Mommy?

235
00:15:17,875 --> 00:15:18,967
I wish...

236
00:15:24,132 --> 00:15:26,726
for happiness like this forever

237
00:15:27,176 --> 00:15:28,803
for you and you...

238
00:15:30,513 --> 00:15:31,685
and for your father.

239
00:15:32,932 --> 00:15:34,059
Boring!

240
00:15:34,142 --> 00:15:36,314
Boring?

241
00:15:36,394 --> 00:15:38,567
Since when has happiness ever been boring?

242
00:15:39,772 --> 00:15:42,776
# Ev'ry night I lie in bed #

243
00:15:42,859 --> 00:15:45,988
# The brightest colors fill my head #

244
00:15:46,070 --> 00:15:51,543
# A million dreams are keepin' me awake #

245
00:15:52,743 --> 00:15:56,084
# I think of what the world could be #

246
00:15:56,164 --> 00:15:59,379
# A vision of the one I see #

247
00:15:59,459 --> 00:16:04,841
# A million dreams is all it's gonna take #

248
00:16:07,758 --> 00:16:09,260
# A million dreams #

249
00:16:09,886 --> 00:16:11,889
# For the world we're gonna make #

250
00:16:27,361 --> 00:16:30,701
The goat prices go up,
so the pork bellies go down.

251
00:16:32,033 --> 00:16:34,122
- Charles, we're leaving.
- Huh?

252
00:16:34,202 --> 00:16:35,498
This bank only wants to lend money

253
00:16:35,578 --> 00:16:36,750
to people with money.

254
00:16:41,292 --> 00:16:43,215
What are you looking at, flop-doodle?

255
00:16:46,047 --> 00:16:47,174
Mr. Barnum.

256
00:16:50,176 --> 00:16:53,850
This venture you propose
is risky and somewhat bizarre.

257
00:16:53,930 --> 00:16:55,807
It's a good bet is what it is, sir.

258
00:16:55,890 --> 00:16:57,392
People don't want to admit it...

259
00:16:57,475 --> 00:17:00,103
but they're fascinated
with the exotic and the macabre.

260
00:17:00,186 --> 00:17:01,404
It's why we stare at it.

261
00:17:02,021 --> 00:17:04,194
The bank is going to need
substantial collateral.

262
00:17:06,108 --> 00:17:09,073
Of course. I, uh...
I wouldn't suggest otherwise.

263
00:17:09,153 --> 00:17:12,282
The deed and title
to my entire flotilla of trading vessels.

264
00:17:16,202 --> 00:17:18,374
Why would a bank loan us $10,000?

265
00:17:18,454 --> 00:17:20,001
Because we put up collateral.

266
00:17:20,831 --> 00:17:22,545
But, dear, we don't have any collateral.

267
00:17:22,625 --> 00:17:24,422
Sure we do. In the South China Seas.

268
00:17:24,502 --> 00:17:25,798
In the South China Seas?

269
00:17:25,878 --> 00:17:28,342
Deep in the South China Seas.

270
00:17:28,422 --> 00:17:30,174
And what did we buy with this loan?

271
00:17:31,676 --> 00:17:34,640
"Barnum's American Museum of Curiosities."

272
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:36,313
What kind of museum is it?

273
00:17:39,225 --> 00:17:40,688
A place to be transported.

274
00:17:40,768 --> 00:17:42,190
A place where people can see things

275
00:17:42,270 --> 00:17:43,237
they've never seen before.

276
00:17:43,854 --> 00:17:44,692
Huh?

277
00:17:44,772 --> 00:17:46,694
- Wax figures?
- Yeah. Yeah.

278
00:17:46,774 --> 00:17:48,651
They're all the rage in Europe. Look.

279
00:17:48,734 --> 00:17:51,199
Marie Antoinette with the
sore throat. Napoleon.

280
00:17:51,279 --> 00:17:52,747
Come here. See?

281
00:17:53,406 --> 00:17:55,659
You've already met some
of the most famous folks in history.

282
00:17:56,033 --> 00:17:57,205
But they're not all wax.

283
00:17:57,493 --> 00:18:01,042
This is the great... O'Malley.

284
00:18:01,122 --> 00:18:03,750
Master of sleight of hand.
A king of deception.

285
00:18:03,833 --> 00:18:05,460
You don't look like a magician.

286
00:18:06,377 --> 00:18:07,253
I'm a thief.

287
00:18:07,837 --> 00:18:10,051
A very good thief.
I caught him nicking my watch.

288
00:18:11,048 --> 00:18:12,094
- See?
- An elephant!

289
00:18:12,174 --> 00:18:13,221
Not just any elephant.

290
00:18:13,301 --> 00:18:15,097
I can get you somethin' real nice.
Just say the word.

291
00:18:15,177 --> 00:18:16,265
Oh. Thank you.

292
00:18:16,345 --> 00:18:17,683
Oh, yeah. This is a ten-ton bull

293
00:18:17,763 --> 00:18:19,685
straight from the plains of Africa.

294
00:18:19,765 --> 00:18:22,143
And look at that.

295
00:18:22,226 --> 00:18:24,273
The tallest giraffe in the world.

296
00:18:24,353 --> 00:18:25,650
Can I climb up its leg?

297
00:18:25,730 --> 00:18:28,027
Absolutely not. Okay.

298
00:18:28,107 --> 00:18:30,576
Now... I know how it looks.

299
00:18:31,235 --> 00:18:32,573
If you didn't, I'd be worried.

300
00:18:32,653 --> 00:18:34,075
I mean, it just needs a little work, but...

301
00:18:34,405 --> 00:18:35,868
The loan has to be paid back every month.

302
00:18:35,948 --> 00:18:37,745
Oh, yeah, we're gonna pay it.
We just need customers.

303
00:18:37,825 --> 00:18:39,168
- Hundreds of them.
- We're gonna get them.

304
00:18:42,747 --> 00:18:44,249
Welcome to the Barnum Museum.

305
00:18:44,332 --> 00:18:45,709
It is one hour of your time, sir,

306
00:18:45,791 --> 00:18:47,129
but it will change your life.

307
00:18:47,209 --> 00:18:50,424
- We have shows on the hour every hour.
- I love your dress.

308
00:18:50,504 --> 00:18:53,344
Surely not for the faint of heart,
but I can tell you're gonna love it.

309
00:18:53,424 --> 00:18:55,471
Half price for anyone who's wearing a hat.

310
00:18:55,551 --> 00:18:57,053
Ho, ho! That's you, sir.

311
00:18:57,136 --> 00:18:58,854
Welcome to the Barnum Museum.

312
00:19:05,227 --> 00:19:06,566
Load of garbage.

313
00:19:06,646 --> 00:19:08,484
Goodness, no. It's rubbish.

314
00:19:08,564 --> 00:19:10,441
Welcome to the Barnum Museum,
where everyone's special...

315
00:19:10,524 --> 00:19:11,446
How many tickets?

316
00:19:12,151 --> 00:19:13,573
- Three.
- Three.

317
00:19:39,679 --> 00:19:41,056
Daddy.

318
00:19:45,518 --> 00:19:47,020
Daddy.

319
00:19:52,274 --> 00:19:54,402
Did you sell any more tickets today?

320
00:19:54,568 --> 00:19:55,990
A few. Yeah.

321
00:19:56,737 --> 00:19:58,785
Most everyone was rushing home,
it's Friday, but...

322
00:20:01,742 --> 00:20:02,834
we sold a few.

323
00:20:04,036 --> 00:20:07,835
I think you have too many dead
things in your museum, Daddy.

324
00:20:07,915 --> 00:20:08,916
Do you?

325
00:20:09,417 --> 00:20:12,546
She's right. You need something alive.

326
00:20:15,798 --> 00:20:16,970
Go to sleep, both of you.

327
00:20:17,383 --> 00:20:19,556
Something sensational.

328
00:20:20,344 --> 00:20:21,766
That's a big word.

329
00:20:21,846 --> 00:20:23,189
It's your word.

330
00:20:24,098 --> 00:20:26,351
Something that isn't stuffed.

331
00:20:27,101 --> 00:20:30,150
- Like a mermaid.
- Or a unicorn.

332
00:20:30,938 --> 00:20:32,690
Unicorns aren't real.

333
00:20:33,357 --> 00:20:35,234
Well, mermaids aren't real either.

334
00:21:02,136 --> 00:21:03,683
You must be Gertrude Stratton.

335
00:21:04,430 --> 00:21:05,522
I'm looking for your son.

336
00:21:06,474 --> 00:21:07,646
I don't have a son.

337
00:21:08,517 --> 00:21:09,980
The hospital record says you do.

338
00:21:10,060 --> 00:21:12,358
Charles, right? Age 22?

339
00:21:17,276 --> 00:21:18,448
Charles!

340
00:21:20,279 --> 00:21:21,492
Charles!

341
00:21:35,336 --> 00:21:36,804
P.T. Barnum, at your service.

342
00:21:38,589 --> 00:21:40,307
I am putting together a show

343
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:42,097
and I need a star.

344
00:21:43,260 --> 00:21:44,762
You want people to laugh at me.

345
00:21:45,387 --> 00:21:46,726
Well, they're laughing anyway, kid,

346
00:21:46,806 --> 00:21:47,898
so might as well get paid.

347
00:21:57,399 --> 00:21:59,402
I see a soldier, no, a general

348
00:21:59,485 --> 00:22:02,783
riding across the stage
with a sword and a gun,

349
00:22:02,863 --> 00:22:04,535
and... and...

350
00:22:04,615 --> 00:22:06,834
and the most beautiful uniform ever made.

351
00:22:07,576 --> 00:22:09,078
People will come from all over the world,

352
00:22:09,161 --> 00:22:11,038
and when they see him, they won't laugh.

353
00:22:17,127 --> 00:22:18,424
They'll salute.

354
00:22:21,090 --> 00:22:24,219
# #

355
00:22:34,812 --> 00:22:35,904
How's it looking, girls?

356
00:22:42,736 --> 00:22:44,488
Hey! You looking for freaks?

357
00:22:44,572 --> 00:22:46,324
I know where you can find one of them.

358
00:22:47,575 --> 00:22:48,788
Really?

359
00:22:53,038 --> 00:22:54,085
Come on, girls.

360
00:22:58,961 --> 00:23:00,007
Hello.

361
00:23:00,087 --> 00:23:01,300
Sir, you shouldn't be here.

362
00:23:01,380 --> 00:23:03,098
I'm sorry. Who's doing that singing?

363
00:23:06,176 --> 00:23:07,143
It's you, isn't it?

364
00:23:08,637 --> 00:23:10,059
Sir, I'll have to ask you to leave.

365
00:23:10,139 --> 00:23:12,358
You are so talented, blessed...

366
00:23:15,019 --> 00:23:16,237
extraordinary.

367
00:23:17,688 --> 00:23:18,815
Unique.

368
00:23:20,441 --> 00:23:22,154
I would even say beautiful.

369
00:23:24,528 --> 00:23:25,746
Sir.

370
00:23:26,572 --> 00:23:28,040
Please leave me alone.

371
00:23:36,081 --> 00:23:37,879
They don't understand, but they will.

372
00:23:40,085 --> 00:23:42,759
# #

373
00:23:52,306 --> 00:23:53,683
This line is so...

374
00:23:53,766 --> 00:23:57,565
Oh, my God! Oh, goodness.

375
00:23:57,645 --> 00:24:01,861
Okay. Anne and W.D. Wheeler.
Brother and sister?

376
00:24:01,941 --> 00:24:03,944
- Yes, sir.
- Terrific. And what do you do?

377
00:24:04,610 --> 00:24:05,737
- Trapeze.
- Trapeze.

378
00:24:07,696 --> 00:24:09,660
- Okay.
- You know, people aren't gonna like it

379
00:24:09,740 --> 00:24:10,787
if you put us on the stage.

380
00:24:11,158 --> 00:24:12,501
Oh, I'm counting on it.

381
00:24:14,954 --> 00:24:18,959
- Is this over... your...
- Entire body.

382
00:24:19,041 --> 00:24:20,543
Terrific. I don't need to see it.

383
00:24:24,213 --> 00:24:27,592
Now. Yes!

384
00:24:29,969 --> 00:24:31,471
Can I just ask how heavy you are?

385
00:24:31,553 --> 00:24:32,896
Do you have a number for that?

386
00:24:33,263 --> 00:24:36,228
- I prefer not to say, but...
- Just between you and me.

387
00:24:36,308 --> 00:24:38,811
500 pounds.

388
00:24:38,894 --> 00:24:42,818
- 750 pounds, you said?
- 750 pounds, it is!

389
00:24:52,449 --> 00:24:53,325
What is your name?

390
00:24:54,201 --> 00:24:56,204
Vasily Palvos, sir.

391
00:24:56,829 --> 00:24:58,250
Yeah, we're gonna change that name.

392
00:24:58,330 --> 00:25:00,424
Uh, I think you're Irish.

393
00:25:02,543 --> 00:25:03,761
We have a show!

394
00:25:05,921 --> 00:25:08,218
That's good, but I need it five times bigger!

395
00:25:08,298 --> 00:25:09,470
And I want it everywhere!

396
00:25:09,550 --> 00:25:11,221
Carriages, sides of trains,

397
00:25:11,301 --> 00:25:14,642
trolleys, crates, milk bottles,
everywhere they look!

398
00:25:14,722 --> 00:25:17,316
Barnum's American Museum.

399
00:25:20,519 --> 00:25:21,941
Nice to see you, sir.

400
00:25:25,691 --> 00:25:27,659
# You stumble through your days #

401
00:25:28,694 --> 00:25:30,241
# Got your head hung low #

402
00:25:30,696 --> 00:25:34,075
# Your sky's a shade of gray #

403
00:25:34,158 --> 00:25:35,621
# Like a zombie in a maze #

404
00:25:35,701 --> 00:25:36,747
Two, please.

405
00:25:36,827 --> 00:25:38,624
# You're asleep inside #

406
00:25:38,704 --> 00:25:41,502
# But you can shake awake #

407
00:25:41,582 --> 00:25:43,545
#'Cause you're just a dead man walkin' #

408
00:25:43,625 --> 00:25:45,127
# Thinkin' that's your only option #

409
00:25:45,210 --> 00:25:46,962
# But you can flick the switch #

410
00:25:47,046 --> 00:25:49,510
# And brighten up your darkest day #

411
00:25:49,590 --> 00:25:51,387
# Sun is up and the color's blindin' #

412
00:25:51,467 --> 00:25:53,430
# Take a world and redefine it #

413
00:25:53,510 --> 00:25:55,182
# Leave behind your narrow mind #

414
00:25:55,262 --> 00:25:56,934
# You'll never be the same #

415
00:25:57,014 --> 00:26:00,604
# Come alive, come alive #

416
00:26:00,684 --> 00:26:02,812
# Go and light your light #

417
00:26:02,895 --> 00:26:04,858
# Let it burn so bright #

418
00:26:04,938 --> 00:26:08,442
# Reachin' up to the sky #

419
00:26:08,859 --> 00:26:10,987
# And it's open wide #

420
00:26:11,070 --> 00:26:12,992
# You're electrified #

421
00:26:13,072 --> 00:26:15,411
# And the world becomes a fantasy #

422
00:26:15,491 --> 00:26:17,538
# And you're more than you could ever be #

423
00:26:17,618 --> 00:26:20,622
# 'Cause you're dreamin'
with your eyes wide open #

424
00:26:20,704 --> 00:26:21,667
Whoa!

425
00:26:21,747 --> 00:26:23,585
# And you know you can't go back again #

426
00:26:23,665 --> 00:26:25,542
# To the world that you were livin' in #

427
00:26:25,626 --> 00:26:29,091
# 'Cause you're dreamin'
with your eyes wide open #

428
00:26:29,171 --> 00:26:31,720
- # So come alive! #
- Whoa!

429
00:26:44,937 --> 00:26:46,108
Lettie! Lettie!

430
00:26:46,188 --> 00:26:47,401
- They're waiting!
- For what?

431
00:26:47,481 --> 00:26:48,983
- For you.
- No.

432
00:26:49,066 --> 00:26:50,158
They don't know it yet...

433
00:26:51,026 --> 00:26:52,244
but they are gonna love you.

434
00:26:53,987 --> 00:26:55,079
Trust me.

435
00:27:00,119 --> 00:27:02,543
Tom! Up, up!

436
00:27:07,960 --> 00:27:09,178
# I see it in your eyes #

437
00:27:10,462 --> 00:27:12,339
# You believe that lie #

438
00:27:12,422 --> 00:27:15,346
# That you need to hide your face #

439
00:27:15,717 --> 00:27:17,560
# Afraid to step outside #

440
00:27:18,512 --> 00:27:20,350
# So you lock the door #

441
00:27:20,430 --> 00:27:23,228
# But don't you stay that way #

442
00:27:23,308 --> 00:27:25,185
# No more livin' in those shadows #

443
00:27:25,269 --> 00:27:27,272
# You and me, we know how that goes #

444
00:27:27,354 --> 00:27:28,481
# 'Cause once you see it #

445
00:27:28,564 --> 00:27:31,487
# Oh, you'll never, never be the same #

446
00:27:31,567 --> 00:27:33,405
# A little bit of lightnin' strikin' #

447
00:27:33,485 --> 00:27:35,324
# Bottled up to keep on shinin' #

448
00:27:35,404 --> 00:27:37,031
# You can prove there's more to you #

449
00:27:37,114 --> 00:27:38,491
# You cannot be afraid #

450
00:27:38,574 --> 00:27:42,329
# Come alive, come alive #

451
00:27:42,786 --> 00:27:44,663
# Go and light your light #

452
00:27:44,746 --> 00:27:46,749
# Let it burn so bright #

453
00:27:46,832 --> 00:27:50,881
# Reachin' up to the sky #

454
00:27:50,961 --> 00:27:52,713
# And it's open wide #

455
00:27:52,796 --> 00:27:55,049
# You're electrified #

456
00:27:55,132 --> 00:27:57,179
# And the world becomes a fantasy #

457
00:27:57,259 --> 00:27:59,181
# And you're more than you could ever be #

458
00:27:59,261 --> 00:28:02,310
# 'Cause you're dreamin'
with your eyes wide open #

459
00:28:03,265 --> 00:28:05,354
# And we know we can't go back again #

460
00:28:05,434 --> 00:28:07,562
# To the world that we were livin' in #

461
00:28:07,644 --> 00:28:11,023
# 'Cause we're dreamin'
with our eyes wide open #

462
00:28:11,106 --> 00:28:12,569
# So come alive! #

463
00:28:12,649 --> 00:28:14,777
Bravo!

464
00:28:17,321 --> 00:28:19,159
That was great!

465
00:28:19,239 --> 00:28:21,242
- More!
- Fantastic!

466
00:28:21,950 --> 00:28:23,202
This is bad.

467
00:28:24,661 --> 00:28:26,413
"Criminal." "Degrading."

468
00:28:27,206 --> 00:28:28,544
"A circus." I like "circus."

469
00:28:28,624 --> 00:28:30,045
That's right, fat boy!

470
00:28:32,377 --> 00:28:34,341
You gonna protect that bearded lady?

471
00:28:34,421 --> 00:28:35,422
Hey!

472
00:28:37,257 --> 00:28:38,634
- Hey! That's enough!
- Freak!

473
00:28:39,134 --> 00:28:40,681
Walter!

474
00:28:40,761 --> 00:28:42,057
Inside, all of you. Right now.

475
00:28:42,137 --> 00:28:43,475
Look at 'em run!

476
00:28:43,555 --> 00:28:45,933
- We don't want your kind!
- Get outta here!

477
00:28:46,016 --> 00:28:48,981
That's right, you freaks!
Your master's calling!

478
00:28:49,061 --> 00:28:50,358
That's quite enough, sir.

479
00:28:54,566 --> 00:28:56,159
Nothing more to look at!

480
00:28:57,361 --> 00:28:58,908
At your service!

00:30:14,980 --> 00:30:16,151
# Yeah #

509
00:30:44,092 --> 00:30:46,595
Peanuts. Get your peanuts here.

510
00:30:47,095 --> 00:30:50,224
Hot, salted peanuts. Piping hot!

511
00:30:50,307 --> 00:30:51,479
One for me, one for the lady.

512
00:30:52,559 --> 00:30:53,936
O'Malley.

513
00:30:58,023 --> 00:31:00,651
Ah, Mr. Bennett from the Herald.

514
00:31:00,734 --> 00:31:02,781
Come to take in another show, huh?

515
00:31:02,861 --> 00:31:04,032
Tell me, Mr. Barnum,

516
00:31:04,112 --> 00:31:05,239
does it bother you

517
00:31:05,322 --> 00:31:07,950
that everything you're selling is fake?

518
00:31:08,825 --> 00:31:10,202
Do these smiles seem fake?

519
00:31:10,660 --> 00:31:12,582
It doesn't matter where they come from.
The joy is real.

520
00:31:12,662 --> 00:31:14,255
So, you are a philanthropist?

521
00:31:14,623 --> 00:31:17,126
Well, hyperbole isn't the worst crime.

522
00:31:17,417 --> 00:31:20,215
Men suffer more from imagining
too little than too much.

523
00:31:20,295 --> 00:31:22,719
The creed of a true fraud.

524
00:31:24,341 --> 00:31:26,344
Mr. Bennett, when was
the last time you smiled

525
00:31:26,426 --> 00:31:28,679
or had a good laugh? Like a real laugh?

526
00:31:30,263 --> 00:31:32,857
A theater critic who can't
find joy in the theater.

527
00:31:33,392 --> 00:31:34,769
Now who's a fraud?

528
00:31:37,896 --> 00:31:39,364
Oh, Mr. Bennett.

529
00:31:40,107 --> 00:31:42,405
That word you used to describe my show?

530
00:31:43,902 --> 00:31:44,903
Has a nice ring to it.

531
00:31:53,829 --> 00:31:56,628
And right this way.

532
00:31:57,207 --> 00:32:00,130
Don't you think there's enough
blind trust in my life?

533
00:32:00,210 --> 00:32:01,631
Well, isn't that what makes it fun?

534
00:32:01,711 --> 00:32:05,090
Keep coming. Okay. Are you ready?

535
00:32:12,305 --> 00:32:13,807
- Is it?
- It is.

536
00:32:16,893 --> 00:32:18,361
Come on. Let's go.

537
00:32:19,312 --> 00:32:20,609
Push.

538
00:32:22,774 --> 00:32:23,775
- Oh.
- Wow.

539
00:32:25,735 --> 00:32:27,324
Helen, that's for you.

540
00:32:30,282 --> 00:32:33,286
And, Caroline, this is for you.

541
00:32:40,542 --> 00:32:43,045
There's a ballet school
right down the street.

542
00:32:43,128 --> 00:32:44,926
Just past your parents' house, actually.

543
00:32:47,507 --> 00:32:49,009
Don't tell me you bought this house

544
00:32:49,092 --> 00:32:51,515
just to rub my parents' noses
in your success?

545
00:32:51,595 --> 00:32:53,313
Well, that wasn't the only reason.

546
00:32:54,890 --> 00:32:56,517
This is the life I promised you.

547
00:32:57,934 --> 00:32:58,901
Shall we?

548
00:32:59,519 --> 00:33:00,395
Phin...

549
00:33:01,980 --> 00:33:02,981
it's beautiful,

550
00:33:03,064 --> 00:33:04,611
but you know, we don't
need all of this to be...

551
00:33:04,691 --> 00:33:06,443
It only took me 25 years, but...

552
00:33:07,569 --> 00:33:09,157
welcome home, Charity Barnum.

553
00:33:47,984 --> 00:33:49,987
- Hello, there.
- There goes Barnum.

554
00:33:57,452 --> 00:33:59,580
Hey, sweetheart,
who's that young man over there?

555
00:34:00,121 --> 00:34:01,339
Oh, that's Phillip Carlyle.

556
00:34:01,873 --> 00:34:03,671
A bit of a scandal, they say.

557
00:34:04,417 --> 00:34:05,839
His last play was a hit in London.

558
00:34:05,919 --> 00:34:07,132
- Play?
- Mmm.

559
00:34:07,212 --> 00:34:10,051
You pay good money to watch people
stand around and talk for two hours,

560
00:34:10,131 --> 00:34:11,633
and they call me a con man.

561
00:34:11,716 --> 00:34:14,845
Ew, what's that smell? Do you smell that?

562
00:34:14,928 --> 00:34:17,142
Ew. Something does smell.

563
00:34:17,222 --> 00:34:19,976
Oh, I know what it is. Peanuts.

564
00:34:29,943 --> 00:34:31,320
I can see it right now.

565
00:34:31,403 --> 00:34:32,741
"Youngest prima ballerina

566
00:34:32,821 --> 00:34:34,414
in the history of the City Ballet."

567
00:34:36,283 --> 00:34:37,496
I'm quitting.

568
00:34:37,576 --> 00:34:38,794
What? Why would you quit?

569
00:34:39,452 --> 00:34:41,917
I started too late. I'll never catch up.

570
00:34:41,997 --> 00:34:43,920
Caroline, you were the best
dancer on that stage.

571
00:34:45,709 --> 00:34:47,302
What? You think I can't spot talent?

572
00:34:48,420 --> 00:34:50,388
Ballet takes years of hard work.

573
00:34:51,006 --> 00:34:52,599
It's not like the circus.

574
00:34:54,092 --> 00:34:55,184
You can't just fake it.

575
00:34:59,848 --> 00:35:01,851
She can't quit. No. No, I mean, she just...

576
00:35:02,434 --> 00:35:04,231
She just feels out of place
with the other girls.

577
00:35:04,311 --> 00:35:05,899
Well, I should certainly hope so.

578
00:35:05,979 --> 00:35:07,947
I've never seen so many
little prima donnas in my life.

579
00:35:08,398 --> 00:35:10,362
Yeah, but those prima donnas
are the most important thing

580
00:35:10,442 --> 00:35:11,780
in the world to her right now.

581
00:35:11,860 --> 00:35:14,032
She'll learn to ignore them just like I did.

582
00:35:14,112 --> 00:35:15,575
She shouldn't have to.

583
00:35:15,655 --> 00:35:17,577
New York society will never accept us.

584
00:35:17,657 --> 00:35:19,371
If they did, they'd have to stop judging

585
00:35:19,451 --> 00:35:21,203
and actually do something with their lives.

586
00:35:21,286 --> 00:35:22,504
This isn't about me.

587
00:35:23,913 --> 00:35:24,789
Oh.

588
00:35:25,290 --> 00:35:27,213
So it's different than everything else then?

589
00:35:28,501 --> 00:35:30,674
I just want her to be proud
of who she is, of her family.

590
00:35:30,754 --> 00:35:32,427
She is proud.

591
00:35:33,214 --> 00:35:35,433
We don't have to be the Carlyles.

592
00:35:40,513 --> 00:35:42,516
Mr. Carlyle. You produced this play?

593
00:35:42,599 --> 00:35:44,727
Yes, I did indeed.

594
00:35:44,809 --> 00:35:46,773
Refunds are available
at the front box office.

595
00:35:46,853 --> 00:35:48,105
P.T. Barnum.

596
00:35:48,605 --> 00:35:49,693
From the circus?

597
00:35:49,773 --> 00:35:51,319
Yes. You... you've been?

598
00:35:51,399 --> 00:35:54,403
God, no. But I have seen the crowds.

599
00:35:55,362 --> 00:35:57,701
People leave your shows a great deal
happier than when they came in,

600
00:35:57,781 --> 00:36:00,000
which is much more
than I can say for my play.

601
00:36:00,492 --> 00:36:02,540
And yet, you have no trouble selling tickets.

602
00:36:04,579 --> 00:36:06,047
That's because I'm selling virtue.

603
00:36:08,416 --> 00:36:09,588
Can I buy you a drink?

604
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:14,009
I wanna go after the carriage trade.

605
00:36:14,089 --> 00:36:15,511
Present legitimate acts,

606
00:36:16,216 --> 00:36:18,469
expand our appeal, go after the snobs.

607
00:36:19,803 --> 00:36:21,806
If you only knew how suffocating they are.

608
00:36:21,888 --> 00:36:23,390
So come join the circus.

609
00:36:23,473 --> 00:36:25,316
You clearly have a flair for show business.

610
00:36:26,643 --> 00:36:28,190
Teach me how to appeal to the highbrows.

611
00:36:29,521 --> 00:36:31,239
- Are you serious?
- Mm-hmm.

612
00:36:31,898 --> 00:36:34,151
Mr. Barnum, I can't just run off
and join the circus.

613
00:36:34,234 --> 00:36:36,031
Why not? Sounds thrilling, doesn't it?

614
00:36:36,111 --> 00:36:37,863
Let's just say that I find it
much more comfortable

615
00:36:37,946 --> 00:36:39,409
admiring your show from afar.

616
00:36:39,489 --> 00:36:41,207
Comfort, the enemy of progress.

617
00:36:41,533 --> 00:36:43,204
Do you understand that
just associating with you

618
00:36:43,284 --> 00:36:44,998
could cost me my inheritance?

619
00:36:45,078 --> 00:36:46,421
Oh, it could cost you more than that.

620
00:36:46,788 --> 00:36:47,789
You'd be risking everything.

621
00:36:47,872 --> 00:36:49,499
But, on the other hand, well,

622
00:36:50,250 --> 00:36:51,921
you just might find yourself a free man.

623
00:36:52,001 --> 00:36:54,755
# #

624
00:36:56,798 --> 00:36:59,721
# Right here, right now,
I put the offer out #

625
00:36:59,801 --> 00:37:02,724
# I don't wanna chase you down,
I know you see it #

626
00:37:02,804 --> 00:37:06,144
# You run with me, and I can cut you free #

627
00:37:06,224 --> 00:37:08,898
# Out of the drudgery and walls you keep in #

628
00:37:10,687 --> 00:37:13,566
# So trade your typical
for somethin' colorful #

629
00:37:13,940 --> 00:37:16,905
# And if it's crazy, live a little crazy #

630
00:37:16,985 --> 00:37:18,237
# You can play it sensible #

631
00:37:18,570 --> 00:37:20,116
# A king of conventional #

632
00:37:20,196 --> 00:37:23,450
# Or you can risk it all and see #

633
00:37:24,451 --> 00:37:27,290
# Don'tchu wanna get away #

634
00:37:27,370 --> 00:37:30,499
# From the same old part you gotta play? #

635
00:37:30,582 --> 00:37:32,003
# 'Cause I got what you need #

636
00:37:32,083 --> 00:37:35,048
# So come with me and take the ride #

637
00:37:35,128 --> 00:37:37,342
# It'll take you to the other side #

638
00:37:37,422 --> 00:37:40,220
# 'Cause you can do like you do
or you can do like me #

639
00:37:40,300 --> 00:37:43,304
# Stay in the cage
or you finally take the key #

640
00:37:43,386 --> 00:37:44,933
# Oh, damn #

641
00:37:45,013 --> 00:37:47,641
# Suddenly you're free to fly #

642
00:37:47,724 --> 00:37:49,852
# It'll take you to the other side #

643
00:37:49,934 --> 00:37:52,774
# Okay, my friend, you wanna cut me in #

644
00:37:52,854 --> 00:37:55,858
# Well, I hate to tell you,
but it just won't happen #

645
00:37:55,940 --> 00:37:59,030
# So thanks, but no, I think I'm good to go #

646
00:37:59,110 --> 00:38:02,033
# 'Cause I quite enjoy the life
you say I'm trapped in #

647
00:38:02,113 --> 00:38:05,037
# Now, I admire you
and that whole show you do #

648
00:38:05,408 --> 00:38:06,871
# You're on to somethin' #

649
00:38:06,951 --> 00:38:08,248
# Really, it's somethin' #

650
00:38:08,328 --> 00:38:09,830
# But I live among the swells #

651
00:38:09,913 --> 00:38:11,334
# And we don't pick up peanut shells #

652
00:38:11,414 --> 00:38:14,462
# I'll have to leave that up to you #

653
00:38:14,542 --> 00:38:17,296
# Don'tchu know that I'm okay #

654
00:38:17,378 --> 00:38:20,468
# With this uptown part I get to play? #

655
00:38:20,548 --> 00:38:22,095
# 'Cause I got what I need #

656
00:38:22,175 --> 00:38:24,889
# And I don't wanna take the ride #

657
00:38:24,969 --> 00:38:27,434
# I don't need to see the other side #

658
00:38:27,514 --> 00:38:30,061
# So go and do like you do,
I'm good to do like me #

659
00:38:30,141 --> 00:38:33,064
# Ain't in a cage,
so I don't need to take the key #

660
00:38:33,144 --> 00:38:34,816
# Oh, damn #

661
00:38:34,896 --> 00:38:37,149
# Can'tchu see I'm doin' fine? #

662
00:38:37,232 --> 00:38:39,485
# I don't need to see the other side #

663
00:38:39,567 --> 00:38:42,407
# Now, is this really
how you'd like to spend your days? #

664
00:38:42,487 --> 00:38:45,160
# Whisky, misery and parties and plays? #

665
00:38:45,240 --> 00:38:46,828
# If I were mixed up with you #

666
00:38:46,908 --> 00:38:48,455
# I'd be the talk of the town #

667
00:38:48,535 --> 00:38:51,207
# Disgraced and disowned,
another one of the clowns #

668
00:38:51,287 --> 00:38:53,540
# But you would finally live a little #

669
00:38:53,623 --> 00:38:55,295
# Finally laugh a little #

670
00:38:55,375 --> 00:38:57,797
# Just let me give you the freedom to dream #

671
00:38:57,877 --> 00:38:59,549
# And it'll wake you up #

672
00:38:59,629 --> 00:39:01,506
# And cure your aching #

673
00:39:01,589 --> 00:39:04,554
# Take your walls and start 'em breaking #

674
00:39:04,634 --> 00:39:08,389
# Now that's a deal that seems worth taking #

675
00:39:09,389 --> 00:39:13,610
# But I guess I'll leave that up to you #

676
00:39:17,438 --> 00:39:18,690
# Well, it's intriguing #

677
00:39:18,773 --> 00:39:20,361
# But to go would cost me greatly #

678
00:39:20,441 --> 00:39:22,193
# So what percentage of the show #

679
00:39:22,277 --> 00:39:23,654
# Would I be taking? #

680
00:39:23,736 --> 00:39:25,033
# Well, fair enough #

681
00:39:25,113 --> 00:39:26,951
# You'd want a piece of all the action #

682
00:39:27,031 --> 00:39:29,954
# I'd give you seven,
we could shake and make it happen #

683
00:39:30,034 --> 00:39:31,411
# I wasn't born this morning #

684
00:39:31,494 --> 00:39:32,871
# Eighteen would be just fine #

685
00:39:32,954 --> 00:39:36,083
# Why not just go ahead
and ask for nickels on the dime? #

686
00:39:36,165 --> 00:39:37,462
- # Fifteen #
- # I'd do eight #

687
00:39:37,542 --> 00:39:39,088
- # Twelve #
- # Maybe nine #

688
00:39:39,168 --> 00:39:40,795
# Ten #

689
00:39:45,258 --> 00:39:46,510
Umm...

690
00:39:50,346 --> 00:39:53,191
Sir, it looks like you
have yourself a junior partner.

691
00:39:54,601 --> 00:39:57,855
What I have is an overcompensated apprentice.

692
00:40:00,356 --> 00:40:02,946
# Don'tchu wanna get away #

693
00:40:03,026 --> 00:40:04,864
- # To a whole #
- # New #

694
00:40:04,944 --> 00:40:06,321
# Part you're gonna play #

695
00:40:06,404 --> 00:40:07,992
- # 'Cause I got #
- # What you need #

696
00:40:08,072 --> 00:40:10,325
# So come with me and take the ride #

697
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:13,039
# To the other side #

698
00:40:13,119 --> 00:40:14,666
# So if you do like I do #

699
00:40:14,746 --> 00:40:16,123
# So if you do like me #

700
00:40:16,205 --> 00:40:17,457
# Forget the cage #

701
00:40:17,540 --> 00:40:19,128
# 'Cause we know how to make the key #

702
00:40:19,208 --> 00:40:20,710
# Oh, damn #

703
00:40:20,793 --> 00:40:23,171
# Suddenly we're free to fly #

704
00:40:23,254 --> 00:40:25,552
# We're goin' to the other side #

705
00:40:25,632 --> 00:40:28,511
- # So if you do like I do #
- # To the other side #

706
00:40:28,593 --> 00:40:31,641
- # So if you do like me #
- # Goin' to the other side #

707
00:40:31,721 --> 00:40:32,892
# 'Cause if you do #

708
00:40:32,972 --> 00:40:35,645
# We're goin' to the other side #

709
00:40:35,725 --> 00:40:38,729
# We're goin' to the other side #

710
00:40:42,357 --> 00:40:45,657
# #

711
00:40:58,790 --> 00:40:59,757
Who is that?

712
00:41:00,375 --> 00:41:03,675
Hey, hey! No one's buying hats
back here. Get out front, go!

713
00:41:04,295 --> 00:41:06,009
W.D., Anne, I wanna introduce

714
00:41:06,089 --> 00:41:07,966
my newest hire, Mr. Phillip Carlyle.

715
00:41:09,884 --> 00:41:11,557
- It's a pleasure to meet you.
- Yeah, pleasure.

716
00:41:13,179 --> 00:41:14,556
And what is your act, Mr. Carlyle?

717
00:41:15,848 --> 00:41:17,475
I don't have an act.

718
00:41:19,102 --> 00:41:20,354
Everyone's got an act.

719
00:41:26,484 --> 00:41:27,572
Mr. Barnum!

720
00:41:27,652 --> 00:41:28,870
Yeah.

721
00:41:30,154 --> 00:41:31,326
You better come see this.

722
00:41:32,991 --> 00:41:34,413
Phillip, keep up!

723
00:41:38,454 --> 00:41:40,543
A bit of a nasty element.

724
00:41:40,623 --> 00:41:41,875
There always is, isn't there?

725
00:41:43,292 --> 00:41:44,964
Nothing draws a crowd quite like a crowd.

726
00:41:45,044 --> 00:41:46,257
We don't want you in our city!

727
00:41:46,337 --> 00:41:48,214
Go home, you freaks!

728
00:41:49,007 --> 00:41:49,928
Freaks!

729
00:41:50,008 --> 00:41:51,510
"Shame of the city."

730
00:41:51,592 --> 00:41:53,932
"The protests cement Mr. Barnum's reputation

731
00:41:54,012 --> 00:41:56,809
as a purveyor of the offensive and indecent."

732
00:41:56,889 --> 00:42:00,644
"Offensive and indecent."
Mr. Bennett, I am blushing.

733
00:42:00,727 --> 00:42:03,524
No, I'm blushing.

734
00:42:03,604 --> 00:42:05,401
What do you care what Bennett thinks?

735
00:42:05,481 --> 00:42:07,320
- He's a prig.
- And a snob.

736
00:42:07,400 --> 00:42:09,322
Yeah, and all the snobs in New York read him.

737
00:42:09,402 --> 00:42:10,529
He does their thinking for them.

738
00:42:10,903 --> 00:42:12,871
Whatever happened
to thriving off controversy?

739
00:42:13,239 --> 00:42:15,287
Yeah, well... hey.

740
00:42:15,533 --> 00:42:17,205
- Do you have any thoughts on this?
- Phillip!

741
00:42:17,285 --> 00:42:19,582
You know what? As a matter of fact, I do.

742
00:42:19,662 --> 00:42:20,789
Helen, come on.

743
00:42:20,872 --> 00:42:21,960
"The Master of the Household

744
00:42:22,040 --> 00:42:23,836
"has it in command of the Queen

745
00:42:23,916 --> 00:42:25,793
"to invite Mr. Phineas T. Barnum

746
00:42:25,877 --> 00:42:27,215
"and his theatrical troupe

747
00:42:27,295 --> 00:42:29,548
to a reception at Buckingham Palace."

748
00:42:30,757 --> 00:42:33,602
The Queen Victoria? Is this real?

749
00:42:34,135 --> 00:42:35,387
I had to pull a few strings.

750
00:42:36,095 --> 00:42:37,809
If you want society to accept you,

751
00:42:37,889 --> 00:42:38,890
you may as well start...

752
00:42:38,973 --> 00:42:42,273
at the very, very top.

753
00:42:43,269 --> 00:42:44,816
Are we all invited?

754
00:42:53,696 --> 00:42:55,159
I guess I'll just have to tell the Queen

755
00:42:55,239 --> 00:42:56,912
that either all of us go...

756
00:42:57,909 --> 00:42:58,910
or none of us will.

757
00:43:04,499 --> 00:43:07,218
The Queen of England!
Can't get much better than that.

758
00:43:15,593 --> 00:43:16,845
Why aren't we in tails?

759
00:43:16,928 --> 00:43:18,016
We're the entertainment.

760
00:43:18,096 --> 00:43:19,814
Don't see you in a costume.

761
00:43:24,143 --> 00:43:27,773
Your Majesty,
Mr. Phineas T. Barnum and his...

762
00:43:29,190 --> 00:43:30,817
Oddities from America!

763
00:43:35,613 --> 00:43:36,865
Is that... is that real?

764
00:43:50,378 --> 00:43:54,133
Your Majesty. May I present Mr. Barnum.

765
00:43:55,049 --> 00:43:56,972
The honor is mine, Mr. Barnum.

766
00:43:58,511 --> 00:43:59,638
And I've heard all about

767
00:43:59,720 --> 00:44:02,474
your little colonel
from my friends in America.

768
00:44:03,224 --> 00:44:05,063
General, ma'am.

769
00:44:05,143 --> 00:44:06,895
You're even smaller than I imagined.

770
00:44:07,353 --> 00:44:08,316
Well, you're not exactly

771
00:44:08,396 --> 00:44:10,109
reaching the top shelf yourself, sweetheart.

772
00:44:32,837 --> 00:44:33,929
That went well.

773
00:44:36,048 --> 00:44:37,470
Your Majesty.

774
00:44:37,758 --> 00:44:38,680
Phillip.

775
00:44:39,385 --> 00:44:41,012
Miss Jenny Lind.

776
00:44:44,557 --> 00:44:47,060
She is luminous.

777
00:44:49,103 --> 00:44:50,104
Who's that?

778
00:44:51,063 --> 00:44:52,235
The opera singer?

779
00:44:53,524 --> 00:44:54,696
Singer, huh?

780
00:44:56,110 --> 00:44:58,329
She's the most famous performer
in all of Europe.

781
00:44:59,197 --> 00:45:01,040
She's sold out La Scala a dozen times.

782
00:45:02,033 --> 00:45:03,660
Not to mention the French Opera.

783
00:45:08,623 --> 00:45:09,715
Ah.

784
00:45:10,958 --> 00:45:12,296
- What are you doing?
- Following you,

785
00:45:12,376 --> 00:45:14,504
- so you can introduce me to Miss Lind.
- Introduce you?

786
00:45:14,587 --> 00:45:16,008
- Yeah.
- I don't know her.

787
00:45:16,088 --> 00:45:17,677
Everybody knows her.
You just said so yourself.

788
00:45:17,757 --> 00:45:19,760
Yeah, exactly. You don't just
march up to someone like this.

789
00:45:19,842 --> 00:45:21,219
Why not? We're personable. She's a person.

790
00:45:24,680 --> 00:45:25,647
Miss Lind.

791
00:45:26,807 --> 00:45:28,104
My name is Phillip Carlyle.

792
00:45:30,686 --> 00:45:33,401
And this extraordinary gentleman
next to me...

793
00:45:33,481 --> 00:45:34,573
Phineas Taylor Barnum.

794
00:45:35,316 --> 00:45:36,154
The pleasure's mine.

795
00:45:36,234 --> 00:45:37,530
Of course, you are the American.

796
00:45:37,610 --> 00:45:39,328
I believe I might have heard of you.

797
00:45:40,321 --> 00:45:42,618
Oh, well, if you've heard of me
all the way over here,

798
00:45:42,698 --> 00:45:43,995
I must be doing something right.

799
00:45:44,992 --> 00:45:46,585
That, or something very wrong.

800
00:45:47,119 --> 00:45:49,668
Well, in the world of publicity,
there's hardly a difference.

801
00:45:50,331 --> 00:45:52,504
I believe those are the words
of a scoundrel, Mr. Barnum.

802
00:45:53,417 --> 00:45:55,795
A showman, Miss Lind, just a showman.

803
00:45:55,878 --> 00:45:57,972
The best on my side of the Atlantic.

804
00:45:58,547 --> 00:45:59,969
Well, if you do say so yourself.

805
00:46:00,841 --> 00:46:03,185
I do, but I don't have to.

806
00:46:04,136 --> 00:46:05,137
- Oh, no. No.
- Right?

807
00:46:05,221 --> 00:46:07,143
No, he is one of the best.

808
00:46:07,223 --> 00:46:09,187
Oh, that's very kind of you. Miss Lind...

809
00:46:09,267 --> 00:46:10,394
let me get to the point.

810
00:46:10,476 --> 00:46:11,939
I'd like to bring you to New York.

811
00:46:12,019 --> 00:46:14,108
And if you agree, I'll make you
the most famous singer

812
00:46:14,188 --> 00:46:16,110
not in Europe, but in the entire world.

813
00:46:16,190 --> 00:46:17,237
Mmm.

814
00:46:18,109 --> 00:46:19,736
And have you heard me sing?

815
00:46:20,236 --> 00:46:22,079
- Absolutely.
- No. No, I haven't.

816
00:46:23,072 --> 00:46:25,450
But like mine, your reputation precedes you,

817
00:46:25,533 --> 00:46:27,410
and, well, I trust your reputation

818
00:46:27,493 --> 00:46:28,961
more than my own taste, so...

819
00:46:29,787 --> 00:46:31,334
I've never been to America.

820
00:46:32,665 --> 00:46:34,253
You will sing in the grandest theater

821
00:46:34,333 --> 00:46:36,586
with the finest orchestra
in the greatest city on Earth.

822
00:46:37,003 --> 00:46:37,925
"Jenny Lind.

823
00:46:38,713 --> 00:46:39,840
"One night only."

824
00:46:39,922 --> 00:46:41,135
Or maybe two.

825
00:46:41,215 --> 00:46:43,679
And at 20 percent of the gate,

826
00:46:43,759 --> 00:46:45,306
it'll be a queen's ransom for your efforts.

827
00:46:45,720 --> 00:46:47,642
I give most of my earnings
to charity, Mr. Barnum.

828
00:46:47,722 --> 00:46:48,974
To orphans and widows.

829
00:46:49,056 --> 00:46:51,520
"Voice of a Nightingale, Heart of an Angel."

830
00:46:51,600 --> 00:46:54,190
That's brilliant. I mean,
the press will go crazy for that story.

831
00:46:54,270 --> 00:46:55,691
That's not a story.

832
00:46:55,771 --> 00:46:57,735
May I ask you something, Mr. Barnum?

833
00:46:57,815 --> 00:46:58,737
Anything.

834
00:47:00,484 --> 00:47:01,531
Why me?

835
00:47:04,280 --> 00:47:05,532
People come to my show

836
00:47:05,614 --> 00:47:06,957
for the pleasure of being hoodwinked.

837
00:47:08,659 --> 00:47:10,457
Just once, I'd love to give them
something real.

838
00:47:17,293 --> 00:47:18,294
Miss Lind.

839
00:47:30,806 --> 00:47:33,025
Everyone is here. Look at this.

840
00:47:33,601 --> 00:47:34,773
Even the Winthrops.

841
00:47:35,644 --> 00:47:36,896
Are you happy?

842
00:47:38,022 --> 00:47:39,490
I will be if this works.

843
00:47:40,316 --> 00:47:41,989
Oh, God. I hope she can sing.

844
00:47:44,987 --> 00:47:46,200
What's taking her so long?

845
00:47:46,280 --> 00:47:47,868
They're still taking their seats.

846
00:47:47,948 --> 00:47:49,245
- Speaking of which.
- Yeah?

847
00:47:49,325 --> 00:47:51,122
Tom and Lettie, the others,
they've just arrived.

848
00:47:51,202 --> 00:47:52,415
What?

849
00:47:52,495 --> 00:47:54,333
Where should I put 'em? Your box?

850
00:47:54,413 --> 00:47:56,460
That box? No, no, no, that's a bit visible.

851
00:47:56,540 --> 00:47:58,629
- Visible?
- The acoustics are actually better

852
00:47:58,709 --> 00:48:00,382
in the standing room.
That's where they should be.

853
00:48:02,129 --> 00:48:03,050
Miss Lind's ready now.

854
00:48:03,130 --> 00:48:04,473
Okay. Thank you, thank God!

855
00:48:06,467 --> 00:48:08,180
This is so awesome.

856
00:48:08,260 --> 00:48:10,513
- Isn't it wonderful?
- Yeah.

857
00:48:10,596 --> 00:48:12,223
- I love it.
- Look at the curtain.

858
00:48:25,903 --> 00:48:27,906
Ladies and gentlemen,
thank you for your patience.

859
00:48:28,322 --> 00:48:29,994
He's out of his element.

860
00:48:30,074 --> 00:48:31,662
What is this about?

861
00:48:31,742 --> 00:48:33,369
Is that Barnum?

862
00:48:33,452 --> 00:48:34,670
This isn't the circus.

863
00:48:35,621 --> 00:48:37,585
I recently had the privilege

864
00:48:37,665 --> 00:48:41,255
of hearing the most divine voice

865
00:48:41,335 --> 00:48:42,423
I've ever heard.

866
00:48:42,503 --> 00:48:43,924
Suddenly, he's a connoisseur.

867
00:48:44,004 --> 00:48:46,974
Now, I know that sounds like Barnum humbug...

868
00:48:47,716 --> 00:48:49,805
but I have 100 bottles
of good champagne on ice

869
00:48:49,885 --> 00:48:52,224
that says this isn't just
another sideshow novelty.

870
00:48:55,099 --> 00:48:56,601
May I present...

871
00:48:56,684 --> 00:48:58,402
the Swedish Nightingale...

872
00:48:59,270 --> 00:49:00,772
Miss Jenny Lind.

873
00:49:10,614 --> 00:49:12,742
# #

874
00:49:25,921 --> 00:49:29,972
# I'm tryin' to hold my breath #

875
00:49:31,760 --> 00:49:35,185
# Let it stay this way #

876
00:49:35,806 --> 00:49:40,278
# Can't let this moment end #

877
00:49:40,811 --> 00:49:44,862
# You set off a dream in me #

878
00:49:46,525 --> 00:49:49,700
# Gettin' louder now #

879
00:49:50,154 --> 00:49:55,411
# Can you hear it echoing? #

880
00:49:56,702 --> 00:49:59,080
# Take my hand #

881
00:49:59,955 --> 00:50:02,834
# Will you share this with me? #

882
00:50:03,918 --> 00:50:07,138
# 'Cause, darlin', without you #

883
00:50:09,882 --> 00:50:13,556
# All the shine of a thousand spotlights #

884
00:50:13,636 --> 00:50:17,015
# All the stars we steal from the night sky #

885
00:50:17,097 --> 00:50:20,272
# Will never be enough #

886
00:50:21,101 --> 00:50:24,321
# Never be enough #

887
00:50:24,772 --> 00:50:28,112
# Towers of gold are still too little #

888
00:50:28,192 --> 00:50:31,115
# These hands could hold the world #

889
00:50:31,195 --> 00:50:35,325
# But it'll never be enough #

890
00:50:35,783 --> 00:50:40,664
# Never be enough #

891
00:50:40,746 --> 00:50:42,544
# For me #

892
00:50:43,082 --> 00:50:45,301
# Never, never #

893
00:50:46,544 --> 00:50:49,013
# Never, never #

894
00:50:50,005 --> 00:50:52,884
# Never, for me #

895
00:50:53,467 --> 00:50:55,595
# For me #

896
00:50:55,678 --> 00:50:58,432
# Never enough #

897
00:50:59,265 --> 00:51:02,688
# Never enough #

898
00:51:02,768 --> 00:51:07,774
# Never enough for me #

899
00:51:07,856 --> 00:51:13,908
# For me, for me #

900
00:51:13,988 --> 00:51:17,703
# All the shine of a thousand spotlights #

901
00:51:17,783 --> 00:51:20,956
# All the stars we steal from the night sky #

902
00:51:21,036 --> 00:51:24,165
# Will never be enough #

903
00:51:24,790 --> 00:51:28,420
# Never be enough #

904
00:51:28,502 --> 00:51:31,631
# Towers of gold are still too little #

905
00:51:32,006 --> 00:51:34,970
# These hands could hold the world #

906
00:51:35,050 --> 00:51:38,930
# But it'll never be enough #

907
00:51:39,388 --> 00:51:46,112
# Never be enough #

908
00:51:46,270 --> 00:51:48,692
# For me #

909
00:51:48,772 --> 00:51:50,820
# Never, never #

910
00:51:52,151 --> 00:51:54,404
# Never, never #

911
00:51:55,696 --> 00:51:58,620
# Never, for me #

912
00:51:59,116 --> 00:52:01,080
# For me #

913
00:52:01,160 --> 00:52:03,207
# Never enough #

914
00:52:03,287 --> 00:52:04,914
# Never, never #

915
00:52:04,997 --> 00:52:06,835
# Never enough #

916
00:52:06,915 --> 00:52:08,542
# Never, never #

917
00:52:08,626 --> 00:52:11,254
# Never enough #

918
00:52:11,712 --> 00:52:15,216
# For me, for me #

919
00:52:15,299 --> 00:52:20,226
# For me #

920
00:52:24,558 --> 00:52:26,561
# For me #

921
00:52:50,876 --> 00:52:51,968
Brava!

922
00:52:52,961 --> 00:52:53,882
Brava!

923
00:52:53,962 --> 00:52:54,963
More!

924
00:52:55,047 --> 00:52:56,265
Wonderful!

925
00:52:57,049 --> 00:52:58,426
Bravissima!

926
00:52:59,218 --> 00:53:00,390
More!

927
00:53:01,178 --> 00:53:02,054
Excellent!

928
00:53:04,556 --> 00:53:05,432
Brava!

929
00:53:07,518 --> 00:53:08,480
Encore!

930
00:53:12,856 --> 00:53:14,608
Jenny, this is my wife,
Charity, and our girls.

931
00:53:14,692 --> 00:53:16,695
Of course, and I've heard so much about you!

932
00:53:16,777 --> 00:53:18,905
And your father tells me
you're a fan of the ballet.

933
00:53:18,987 --> 00:53:21,081
Yes, I'm studying ballet.

934
00:53:21,281 --> 00:53:22,908
Are you?

935
00:53:22,991 --> 00:53:24,955
- Of course, I am.
- And, of course, she is.

936
00:53:25,035 --> 00:53:26,582
And what about you, Helen?

937
00:53:26,662 --> 00:53:28,125
You look like a princess, ma'am.

938
00:53:29,331 --> 00:53:33,507
I have to admit, Barnum... she is remarkable.

939
00:53:34,002 --> 00:53:36,426
Enough to bring joy
to the most joyless critic, isn't she?

940
00:53:36,839 --> 00:53:40,012
Mmm. And in the hands
of a real purveyor of the arts,

941
00:53:40,092 --> 00:53:42,516
she could be something in this country.

942
00:53:43,262 --> 00:53:45,434
Shame, she's fallen in with you.

943
00:53:45,514 --> 00:53:47,311
You really are better
on the page, Mr. Bennett,

944
00:53:47,391 --> 00:53:48,604
hard as that is to believe.

945
00:53:48,684 --> 00:53:50,186
Mr. Barnum, I'd love to meet Miss Lind.

946
00:53:50,269 --> 00:53:52,608
- And you will meet Miss Lind.
- Would you introduce us?

947
00:53:52,688 --> 00:53:54,151
- If you just give me a moment...
- Phineas.

948
00:53:54,231 --> 00:53:55,194
Yes.

949
00:53:55,274 --> 00:53:57,402
You've... done well.

950
00:54:00,195 --> 00:54:01,492
Thank you.

951
00:54:04,700 --> 00:54:05,918
Allow me to introduce you.

952
00:54:08,328 --> 00:54:10,417
Uh, excuse me, Jenny.

953
00:54:10,497 --> 00:54:12,750
I'd like you to meet Charity's parents.

954
00:54:13,375 --> 00:54:14,627
Mr. and Mrs. Hallett.

955
00:54:14,710 --> 00:54:15,586
Ah, pleasure.

956
00:54:15,669 --> 00:54:17,546
- How do you do? Very nice to meet you.
- Good to meet you.

957
00:54:18,464 --> 00:54:20,182
- Mother.
- Hello, dear.

958
00:54:20,549 --> 00:54:22,347
Are these...

959
00:54:22,968 --> 00:54:24,890
Yes, yes, those are your granddaughters.

960
00:54:24,970 --> 00:54:27,267
- Phineas, not here.
- Not here?

961
00:54:27,347 --> 00:54:29,061
You afraid I'm gonna embarrass your parents

962
00:54:29,141 --> 00:54:30,479
in front of their fancy friends?

963
00:54:30,559 --> 00:54:32,523
I... I really don't think I have that power.

964
00:54:32,603 --> 00:54:34,900
An insignificant man like me

965
00:54:34,980 --> 00:54:38,029
who was clearly destined
to lead an insignificant life.

966
00:54:39,193 --> 00:54:42,197
All that fortune,
and still just the tailor's boy.

967
00:54:43,238 --> 00:54:44,285
Get out.

968
00:54:49,077 --> 00:54:51,580
Well, Phineas...

969
00:54:51,663 --> 00:54:54,628
I believe I told you that free champagne

970
00:54:54,708 --> 00:54:56,130
is a recipe for disaster.

971
00:54:57,169 --> 00:54:58,340
- Charity.
- Now would everyone please

972
00:54:58,420 --> 00:55:01,139
- raise their glasses?
- Charity.

973
00:55:02,216 --> 00:55:03,554
To Mr. Barnum,

974
00:55:03,634 --> 00:55:05,305
who has shown once and for all

975
00:55:05,385 --> 00:55:08,058
that a man's station is limited only

976
00:55:08,138 --> 00:55:09,640
by his imagination.

977
00:55:11,934 --> 00:55:13,937
- To Barnum! To Barnum!
- Thank you.

978
00:55:14,019 --> 00:55:14,986
To Mr. Barnum.

979
00:55:18,482 --> 00:55:19,358
Thank you.

980
00:55:20,567 --> 00:55:23,031
It's hard to understand wealth and privilege

981
00:55:23,111 --> 00:55:24,283
when you're born into it.

982
00:55:27,407 --> 00:55:29,831
I sometimes don't feel like I belong here.

983
00:55:31,411 --> 00:55:32,538
You?

984
00:55:34,081 --> 00:55:36,300
I was born out of wedlock...

985
00:55:37,084 --> 00:55:38,882
and that brought shame upon my family.

986
00:55:40,295 --> 00:55:41,967
And life always manages to remind me

987
00:55:42,047 --> 00:55:43,635
that I don't deserve a place in this world.

988
00:55:43,715 --> 00:55:47,845
And that... leaves a hole that
no ovation can ever fill.

989
00:55:54,017 --> 00:55:55,105
- Mr. Phineas!
- Guys...

990
00:55:55,185 --> 00:55:56,812
Lord, that lady can sing!

991
00:55:56,895 --> 00:55:57,941
I know.

992
00:55:58,021 --> 00:55:59,648
Think she likes a man in uniform?

993
00:55:59,731 --> 00:56:01,653
I'm sure she does.
Okay, what are you doing here?

994
00:56:01,733 --> 00:56:02,946
You got a show in an hour, okay?

995
00:56:03,026 --> 00:56:05,154
That's enough time for us
to have at least three drinks, right?

996
00:56:05,237 --> 00:56:07,034
- Come on, let's go.
- No, no, no. Lettie!

997
00:56:07,114 --> 00:56:08,866
- What?
- It's very crowded in here, okay?

998
00:56:08,949 --> 00:56:11,168
And I can't have you mingling... guys!

999
00:56:11,827 --> 00:56:14,205
Who's gonna pay admission if you're
out there for all the world to see?

1000
00:56:14,288 --> 00:56:15,710
- Okay? Have a great show.
- Wait.

1001
00:56:16,456 --> 00:56:18,333
Ladies and gentlemen, a toast!

1002
00:56:18,417 --> 00:56:20,465
Jenny, America may not know it yet...

1003
00:56:21,378 --> 00:56:23,255
but they are going to love you.

1004
00:56:23,338 --> 00:56:25,010
To Miss Lind!

1005
00:56:32,097 --> 00:56:35,272
# I am not a stranger to the dark #

1006
00:56:36,685 --> 00:56:39,149
# Hide away, they say #

1007
00:56:39,229 --> 00:56:41,948
# 'Cause we don't want your broken parts #

1008
00:56:42,733 --> 00:56:47,079
# I've learned to be
ashamed of all my scars #

1009
00:56:47,738 --> 00:56:50,160
# Run away, they say #

1010
00:56:50,240 --> 00:56:53,080
# No one'll love you as you are #

1011
00:56:53,160 --> 00:56:56,500
# But I won't let them
break me down to dust #

1012
00:56:56,580 --> 00:56:59,959
# I know that there's a place for us #

1013
00:57:00,042 --> 00:57:04,138
# For we are glorious #

1014
00:57:05,213 --> 00:57:09,719
# When the sharpest words wanna cut me down #

1015
00:57:10,260 --> 00:57:11,557
# I'm gonna send a flood #

1016
00:57:11,637 --> 00:57:14,561
# Gonna drown 'em out #

1017
00:57:14,806 --> 00:57:17,309
# I am brave, I am bruised #

1018
00:57:17,392 --> 00:57:19,815
# I am who I'm meant to be #

1019
00:57:19,895 --> 00:57:21,066
# This is me #

1020
00:57:21,146 --> 00:57:25,151
# Look out 'cause here I come #

1021
00:57:25,233 --> 00:57:26,905
# And I'm marchin' on #

1022
00:57:26,985 --> 00:57:29,613
# To the beat I drum #

1023
00:57:29,696 --> 00:57:32,411
# I'm not scared to be seen #

1024
00:57:32,491 --> 00:57:34,830
# I make no apologies #

1025
00:57:34,910 --> 00:57:35,956
# This is me #

1026
00:57:42,918 --> 00:57:44,636
What are they doing here?

1027
00:57:50,759 --> 00:57:53,638
# Another round of bullets hits my skin #

1028
00:57:54,888 --> 00:57:56,390
# Well, fire away #

1029
00:57:56,765 --> 00:58:00,439
# 'Cause today
I won't let the shame sink in #

1030
00:58:00,519 --> 00:58:03,233
# We are burstin' through the barricades #

1031
00:58:03,313 --> 00:58:05,235
# And reachin' for the sun #

1032
00:58:05,315 --> 00:58:07,818
# We are warriors #

1033
00:58:07,901 --> 00:58:09,528
# Yeah, that's what we've become #

1034
00:58:09,611 --> 00:58:10,908
# Yeah, that's what we've become #

1035
00:58:10,988 --> 00:58:13,785
# I won't let them break me down to dust #

1036
00:58:13,865 --> 00:58:15,329
# I know that there's a place for us #

1037
00:58:15,409 --> 00:58:16,501
Go home!

1038
00:58:17,035 --> 00:58:20,289
# For we are glorious #

1039
00:58:20,622 --> 00:58:25,003
# When the sharpest words wanna cut me down #

1040
00:58:25,627 --> 00:58:29,757
# I'm gonna send a flood,
gonna drown 'em out #

1041
00:58:30,048 --> 00:58:32,596
# I am brave, I am bruised #

1042
00:58:32,676 --> 00:58:34,973
# I am who I'm meant to be #

1043
00:58:35,053 --> 00:58:36,224

00:59:30,108 --> 00:59:32,781
# This is brave, this is bruised #

1066
00:59:32,861 --> 00:59:35,033
# This is who I'm meant to be #

1067
00:59:35,113 --> 00:59:36,365
# This is me #

1068
00:59:37,616 --> 00:59:39,619
# Look out, 'cause here I come #

1069
00:59:39,701 --> 00:59:42,079
# Look out, 'cause here I come #

1070
00:59:42,162 --> 00:59:44,459
# And I'm marchin' on to the beat I drum #

1071
00:59:44,539 --> 00:59:47,293
- # Marchin' on, marchin', marchin' on #
- # To the beat I drum #

1072
00:59:47,375 --> 00:59:51,174
# I'm not scared to be seen,
I make no apologies #

1073
00:59:51,254 --> 00:59:52,342
# This is me #

1074
00:59:52,422 --> 00:59:54,511
# Whenever the words wanna cut me down #

1075
00:59:54,591 --> 00:59:57,140
# I'll send the flood to drown 'em out #

1076
00:59:58,011 --> 01:00:00,851
- # I'm gonna send a flood #
- # Oh #

1077
01:00:00,931 --> 01:00:04,229
- # Gonna drown them out #
- # Oh #

1078
01:00:04,309 --> 01:00:06,148
# Oh, oh, oh #

1079
01:00:06,228 --> 01:00:07,524
# This is me #

1080
01:00:12,901 --> 01:00:14,778
Why can't you just put
more shows in New York?

1081
01:00:14,861 --> 01:00:16,074
Why do you need to tour the country?

1082
01:00:16,154 --> 01:00:17,701
Why did Napoleon march on Russia?

1083
01:00:18,532 --> 01:00:19,703
Napoleon was defeated.

1084
01:00:19,783 --> 01:00:21,626
Napoleon didn't have a 60-piece orchestra.

1085
01:00:22,410 --> 01:00:23,623
A 60-piece orchestra?

1086
01:00:23,703 --> 01:00:25,956
Just get the cheapest musicians
you can and watch that.

1087
01:00:26,039 --> 01:00:27,085
We'll still have to board them.

1088
01:00:27,165 --> 01:00:28,667
We'll get married ones,
they can share a bunk.

1089
01:00:28,750 --> 01:00:30,464
O'Malley, that's Caroline's piggy bank.

1090
01:00:30,544 --> 01:00:31,921
- Custom sets?
- Yeah.

1091
01:00:32,003 --> 01:00:33,300
- Fireworks?
- Uh-huh.

1092
01:00:33,380 --> 01:00:34,347
Inside theaters?

1093
01:00:34,923 --> 01:00:36,011
That's genius.

1094
01:00:36,091 --> 01:00:37,637
No. Hey, P.T.

1095
01:00:37,717 --> 01:00:39,389
These are the most
famous theaters in the country.

1096
01:00:39,469 --> 01:00:41,346
They make you buy the seats
in advance just to book them.

1097
01:00:41,429 --> 01:00:42,305
Yeah. I took out a loan.

1098
01:00:42,389 --> 01:00:45,268
- And we have to pay Jenny in advance?
- It was a large loan. Okay?

1099
01:00:45,350 --> 01:00:46,938
You're not gonna see a penny of profit

1100
01:00:47,018 --> 01:00:48,315
until your 40th show...

1101
01:00:48,395 --> 01:00:49,362
41st, actually.

1102
01:00:49,729 --> 01:00:51,193
You're risking everything you've built here.

1103
01:00:51,273 --> 01:00:52,360
How do you think I built it?

1104
01:00:52,440 --> 01:00:54,192
We'll have plenty of profits
to go around after this.

1105
01:00:54,276 --> 01:00:55,403
- P.T.?
- What?

1106
01:00:55,485 --> 01:00:57,449
Your attention has been divided long enough.

1107
01:00:57,529 --> 01:00:58,742
Our gate is down,

1108
01:00:58,822 --> 01:01:00,243
we have more protesters every day.

1109
01:01:00,323 --> 01:01:01,745
You just need to get people to come back.

1110
01:01:01,825 --> 01:01:03,577
"If you haven't been
to the Barnum Museum lately,

1111
01:01:03,660 --> 01:01:05,082
you haven't been at the Barnum Museum."

1112
01:01:05,162 --> 01:01:06,334
They come to see you.

1113
01:01:07,164 --> 01:01:08,291
Your crazy ideas...

1114
01:01:08,915 --> 01:01:11,168
your new acts, the unusual.

1115
01:01:11,251 --> 01:01:13,879
Well, then how about you show
them a smile? That'd be unusual.

1116
01:01:13,962 --> 01:01:15,339
Keep rehearsing. Just make it very clear

1117
01:01:15,422 --> 01:01:17,800
I expect them to afford you
all the deference you deserve

1118
01:01:17,883 --> 01:01:19,601
and that they should be nice to you anyway.

1119
01:01:20,927 --> 01:01:22,930
Ain't that a sight for sore eyes?

1120
01:01:23,013 --> 01:01:24,640
Couldn't even say "hello."

1121
01:01:24,723 --> 01:01:26,771
Or "goodbye." He's going on tour.

1122
01:01:27,350 --> 01:01:30,023
- Sorry, guys.
- Oh, pull yourself together, Carlyle.

1123
01:01:30,103 --> 01:01:31,480
Don't you have somewhere to be?

1124
01:01:37,611 --> 01:01:40,831
Anne Wheeler.
Mr. Barnum said he left a ticket for me.

1125
01:01:45,911 --> 01:01:47,249
I'm... I'm sorry.

1126
01:01:47,329 --> 01:01:49,042
I... I believe there's
only supposed to be one.

1127
01:01:49,122 --> 01:01:50,624
No, there's meant to be two.

1128
01:01:56,421 --> 01:01:58,048
I wasn't sure you'd come if I asked.

1129
01:02:03,136 --> 01:02:04,263
Five minutes to curtain.

1130
01:02:07,724 --> 01:02:09,271
I've always wanted to go to the theater.

1131
01:02:16,233 --> 01:02:17,701
Phillip, is that you?

1132
01:02:19,319 --> 01:02:21,162
Mother. Father.

1133
01:02:22,489 --> 01:02:23,661
This is Anne Wheeler.

1134
01:02:25,367 --> 01:02:26,209
Phillip...

1135
01:02:27,202 --> 01:02:28,579
have you no shame?

1136
01:02:28,828 --> 01:02:31,627
Associating yourself with that
Barnum business is one thing...

1137
01:02:32,707 --> 01:02:34,334
but parading around with the help?

1138
01:02:37,295 --> 01:02:38,137
Anne.

1139
01:02:39,339 --> 01:02:41,307
Anne! Anne!

1140
01:02:47,305 --> 01:02:49,023
How dare you speak to her like that.

1141
01:02:51,726 --> 01:02:53,603
You forget your place, Phillip.

1142
01:02:53,687 --> 01:02:54,859
My place?

1143
01:02:55,855 --> 01:02:57,448
Mother, if this is my place...

1144
01:02:57,899 --> 01:02:59,196
then I don't want any part of it.

1145
01:03:09,536 --> 01:03:10,378
Anne.

1146
01:03:15,333 --> 01:03:16,835
They're small-minded people.

1147
01:03:23,967 --> 01:03:25,180
Why do you care what they think?

1148
01:03:25,260 --> 01:03:26,853
It's not just them.

1149
01:03:28,680 --> 01:03:30,268
You've never had somebody look at you

1150
01:03:30,348 --> 01:03:31,725
the way your parents looked at me.

1151
01:03:34,144 --> 01:03:35,817
The way everyone would look at us.

1152
01:03:39,691 --> 01:03:41,614
# You know I want you #

1153
01:03:43,403 --> 01:03:46,748
# It's not a secret I try to hide #

1154
01:03:47,449 --> 01:03:49,417
# I know you want me #

1155
01:03:52,120 --> 01:03:55,374
# So don't keep sayin' our hands are tied #

1156
01:03:55,915 --> 01:03:58,088
# You claim it's not in the cards #

1157
01:03:58,168 --> 01:04:00,966
# And fate is pulling you miles away #

1158
01:04:01,046 --> 01:04:03,800
# And out of reach from me #

1159
01:04:03,882 --> 01:04:05,470
# But you're here in my heart #

1160
01:04:05,550 --> 01:04:08,645
# So who can stop me if I decide #

1161
01:04:08,762 --> 01:04:12,983
# That you're my destiny? #

1162
01:04:14,017 --> 01:04:17,857
# What if we rewrite the stars? #

1163
01:04:17,937 --> 01:04:21,487
# Say you were made to be mine? #

1164
01:04:21,733 --> 01:04:25,283
# Nothing could keep us apart #

1165
01:04:25,695 --> 01:04:29,245
# You'd be the one I was meant to find #

1166
01:04:29,449 --> 01:04:31,121
# It's up to you #

1167
01:04:31,201 --> 01:04:32,953
# And it's up to me #

1168
01:04:33,244 --> 01:04:36,918
# No one can say what we get to be #

1169
01:04:36,998 --> 01:04:40,719
# So why don't we rewrite the stars? #

1170
01:04:40,960 --> 01:04:44,931
# Maybe the world could be ours #

1171
01:04:45,340 --> 01:04:46,216
# Tonight #

1172
01:04:54,599 --> 01:04:56,272
# You think it's easy? #

1173
01:04:58,645 --> 01:05:02,235
# You think I don't want to run to you? #

1174
01:05:02,315 --> 01:05:06,031
# But there are mountains #

1175
01:05:06,111 --> 01:05:09,826
# And there are doors
that we can't walk through #

1176
01:05:09,906 --> 01:05:11,995
# I know you're wonderin' why #

1177
01:05:12,075 --> 01:05:13,827
# Because we're able to be #

1178
01:05:13,910 --> 01:05:17,915
# Just you and me within these walls #

1179
01:05:17,997 --> 01:05:19,874
# But when we go outside #

1180
01:05:19,958 --> 01:05:21,585
# You're gonna wake up and see #

1181
01:05:21,668 --> 01:05:27,801
# That it was hopeless after all #

1182
01:05:29,717 --> 01:05:33,597
# No one can rewrite the stars #

1183
01:05:33,680 --> 01:05:37,435
# How can you say you'll be mine? #

1184
01:05:37,517 --> 01:05:41,232
# Ev'rything keeps us apart #

1185
01:05:41,312 --> 01:05:44,903
# And I'm not the one
you were meant to find #

1186
01:05:44,983 --> 01:05:46,860
# It's not up to you #

1187
01:05:46,943 --> 01:05:48,615
# It's not up to me #

1188
01:05:48,695 --> 01:05:52,535
# When everyone tells us what we can be #

1189
01:05:52,615 --> 01:05:56,745
# How can we rewrite the stars? #

1190
01:05:56,828 --> 01:06:00,708
# Say that the world can be ours #

1191
01:06:01,166 --> 01:06:02,167
# Tonight? #

1192
01:06:02,250 --> 01:06:06,091
# All I want is to fly with you #

1193
01:06:06,171 --> 01:06:09,886
# All I want is to fall with you #

1194
01:06:09,966 --> 01:06:14,347
# So just give me all of you #

1195
01:06:14,429 --> 01:06:16,306
- # It feels impossible #
- # It's not impossible #

1196
01:06:16,389 --> 01:06:18,103
# Is it impossible? #

1197
01:06:18,183 --> 01:06:21,856
# Say that it's possible #

1198
01:06:21,936 --> 01:06:25,735
# How do we rewrite the stars? #

1199
01:06:25,815 --> 01:06:29,364
# Say you were made to be mine? #

1200
01:06:29,444 --> 01:06:33,159
# Nothing can keep us apart #

1201
01:06:33,239 --> 01:06:37,164
# 'Cause you are the one
I was meant to find #

1202
01:06:37,410 --> 01:06:40,708
# It's up to you and it's up to me #

1203
01:06:40,788 --> 01:06:44,379
# No one can say what we get to be #

1204
01:06:44,459 --> 01:06:48,383
# Why don't we rewrite the stars? #

1205
01:06:48,463 --> 01:06:53,845
# Changin' the world to be ours #

1206
01:07:01,476 --> 01:07:03,570
# You know I want you #

1207
01:07:05,230 --> 01:07:08,359
# It's not a secret I try to hide #

1208
01:07:09,150 --> 01:07:11,574
# But I can't have you #

1209
01:07:12,987 --> 01:07:17,333
# We're bound to break
and my hands are tied #

1210
01:07:33,925 --> 01:07:36,723
First, it was buying a house
on the same street as my parents.

1211
01:07:36,803 --> 01:07:37,895
Then, meeting the Queen.

1212
01:07:38,429 --> 01:07:41,183
Then bringing Jenny Lind,
then my father the other night.

1213
01:07:41,808 --> 01:07:43,651
When will it ever be enough for you?

1214
01:07:45,478 --> 01:07:47,105
I'm doing this for Caroline and Helen.

1215
01:07:47,480 --> 01:07:49,483
Look around you. They have everything.

1216
01:07:49,566 --> 01:07:50,987
- You don't understand.
- I do understand.

1217
01:07:51,067 --> 01:07:52,364
No, you don't understand.

1218
01:07:53,945 --> 01:07:54,946
How could you?

1219
01:07:58,241 --> 01:08:00,084
My father was treated like dirt.

1220
01:08:00,827 --> 01:08:02,170
I was treated like dirt...

1221
01:08:03,496 --> 01:08:04,918
and my children will not be.

1222
01:08:05,415 --> 01:08:07,418
You don't need everyone to love you, Phin.

1223
01:08:09,586 --> 01:08:11,930
Just a few good people.

1224
01:08:14,674 --> 01:08:15,846
I know that.

1225
01:08:25,893 --> 01:08:26,769
Sir.

1226
01:08:29,564 --> 01:08:30,782
No, no! Daddy!

1227
01:08:31,524 --> 01:08:32,742
Daddy!

1228
01:08:33,651 --> 01:08:35,198
Daddy, no! Wait!

1229
01:08:35,695 --> 01:08:36,822
- Daddy!
- Go!

1230
01:08:36,904 --> 01:08:38,531
Wait, Daddy!

1231
01:08:40,199 --> 01:08:42,953
# Some people long for a life #

1232
01:08:43,036 --> 01:08:45,915
# That is simple and planned #

1233
01:08:46,748 --> 01:08:48,751
# Tied with a ribbon #

1234
01:08:49,125 --> 01:08:51,594
# Some people won't sail the sea #

1235
01:08:52,086 --> 01:08:54,510
# 'Cause they're safer on land #

1236
01:08:55,673 --> 01:08:57,720
# To follow what's written #

1237
01:08:57,800 --> 01:09:01,179
# But I'd follow you #

1238
01:09:01,262 --> 01:09:05,517
# To the great unknown #

1239
01:09:06,934 --> 01:09:10,233
# Off to a world #

1240
01:09:10,313 --> 01:09:14,694
# We call our own #

1241
01:09:18,029 --> 01:09:19,906
# Mountains and valleys #

1242
01:09:19,989 --> 01:09:23,368
# And all that will come in between #

1243
01:09:24,702 --> 01:09:26,666
# Desert and ocean #

1244
01:09:26,746 --> 01:09:28,248
# You pull me in #

1245
01:09:28,331 --> 01:09:32,382
# And together we're lost in a dream #

1246
01:09:33,378 --> 01:09:35,631
# Always in motion #

1247
01:09:35,713 --> 01:09:38,842
# So I risk it all #

1248
01:09:38,925 --> 01:09:43,180
# Just to be with you #

1249
01:09:44,430 --> 01:09:48,229
# And I risk it all #

1250
01:09:48,309 --> 01:09:52,485
# For this life we choose #

1251
01:09:53,690 --> 01:09:55,153
# Hand in my hand #

1252
01:09:55,233 --> 01:09:59,488
# And you promised to never let go #

1253
01:09:59,862 --> 01:10:02,327
# We're walkin' a tightrope #

1254
01:10:02,407 --> 01:10:04,034
# High in the sky #

1255
01:10:04,117 --> 01:10:08,666
# We can see the whole world down below #

1256
01:10:08,746 --> 01:10:12,462
# We're walkin' a tightrope #

1257
01:10:12,542 --> 01:10:14,920
# Never sure #

1258
01:10:15,002 --> 01:10:20,259
# Will you catch me if I should fall? #

1259
01:10:32,520 --> 01:10:33,608
Brava!

1260
01:10:39,861 --> 01:10:41,908
# Well, it's all an adventure #

1261
01:10:41,988 --> 01:10:45,288
# That comes with a breathtakin' view #

1262
01:10:46,826 --> 01:10:50,706
# Walkin' a tightrope #

1263
01:10:51,289 --> 01:10:52,416
# With you #

1264
01:10:52,498 --> 01:10:57,300
# Oh, oh, oh, oh #

1265
01:11:00,131 --> 01:11:01,508
# With you #

1266
01:11:01,591 --> 01:11:06,641
# Oh, oh, oh, oh #

1267
01:11:06,721 --> 01:11:08,598
# With you #

1268
01:11:09,015 --> 01:11:15,817
# With you #

1269
01:11:15,897 --> 01:11:18,571
# Oh #

1270
01:11:20,193 --> 01:11:26,576
# With you #

1271
01:11:26,991 --> 01:11:30,336
# Oh, oh, oh #

1272
01:11:32,079 --> 01:11:33,831
# With you #

1273
01:11:45,635 --> 01:11:48,307
"It is as though we have learned
for the first time...

1274
01:11:48,387 --> 01:11:50,264
what singing really is."

1275
01:11:50,348 --> 01:11:53,943
"Miss Lind deserves
our nation's highest esteem

1276
01:11:54,477 --> 01:11:56,571
and most lavish ovations."

1277
01:11:58,439 --> 01:12:00,942
- I mean...
- The world at our feet.

1278
01:12:01,859 --> 01:12:04,237
Well, Mr. Barnum.

1279
01:12:05,238 --> 01:12:06,740
This...

1280
01:12:08,366 --> 01:12:09,208
is...

1281
01:12:13,246 --> 01:12:15,249
to making dreams come true.

1282
01:12:15,331 --> 01:12:16,298
Thank you, Jenny.

1283
01:12:29,554 --> 01:12:30,806
It's two hours to curtain.

1284
01:12:32,682 --> 01:12:34,685
I've given you the world, haven't I?

1285
01:12:38,771 --> 01:12:41,650
I... I, uh... I should go. I...

1286
01:12:43,234 --> 01:12:44,986
I've become a distraction. I'm sorry, Jenny.

1287
01:12:45,069 --> 01:12:46,866
- No.
- You should finish the tour without me.

1288
01:12:46,946 --> 01:12:48,117
What? You're leaving?

1289
01:12:48,197 --> 01:12:50,165
- Well, the itinerary's well in hand.
- So, that's it.

1290
01:12:50,616 --> 01:12:51,617
What do you mean?

1291
01:12:53,160 --> 01:12:55,379
I'm just another one of your little acts.

1292
01:12:56,205 --> 01:12:57,627
- Jenny.
- I'm done.

1293
01:12:58,916 --> 01:13:01,169
Jenny. Jenny, please.

1294
01:13:01,252 --> 01:13:02,595
You have to finish the tour.

1295
01:13:03,504 --> 01:13:04,380
Must I?

1296
01:13:04,463 --> 01:13:05,806
It... it will ruin me.

1297
01:13:06,757 --> 01:13:09,972
When you're careless
with other people, Mr. Barnum,

1298
01:13:10,052 --> 01:13:11,891
you bring ruin upon yourself.

1299
01:13:11,971 --> 01:13:13,768
I have risked everything.

1300
01:13:13,848 --> 01:13:15,066
Well, so did I.

1301
01:13:15,725 --> 01:13:17,352
And it seems we both lost.

1302
01:13:23,190 --> 01:13:26,906
# All the stars we steal from the night sky #

1303
01:13:26,986 --> 01:13:30,911
# Will never be enough #

1304
01:13:32,116 --> 01:13:35,120
# Never be enough #

1305
01:13:36,412 --> 01:13:40,086
# Towers of gold are still too little #

1306
01:13:40,166 --> 01:13:43,506
# These hands could hold the world #

1307
01:13:43,586 --> 01:13:48,183
# But it'll never be enough #

1308
01:13:49,258 --> 01:13:53,388
# Never be enough #

1309
01:14:30,716 --> 01:14:31,968
Thank you.

1310
01:14:37,390 --> 01:14:39,604
What was that?

1311
01:14:39,684 --> 01:14:40,981
That was goodbye.

1312
01:14:47,274 --> 01:14:48,901
Hey, thank you very much for coming.

1313
01:14:48,985 --> 01:14:50,862
- Tell your friends and neighbors!
- What a wonderful show!

1314
01:14:50,945 --> 01:14:52,948
Who enjoyed themselves? You? You?

1315
01:14:53,030 --> 01:14:54,952
Tell everyone how much fun
you had at the circus!

1316
01:14:55,032 --> 01:14:56,829
New acts every night!

1317
01:14:56,909 --> 01:14:59,333
Hey! Ringmaster.

1318
01:15:01,664 --> 01:15:04,167
Gentlemen, gonna have to ask you to leave.

1319
01:15:04,250 --> 01:15:06,924
This is our town, son.

1320
01:15:07,670 --> 01:15:08,883
We think you should leave.

1321
01:15:08,963 --> 01:15:11,091
You and your freaks.

1322
01:15:11,173 --> 01:15:12,595
And your spooks.

1323
01:15:14,051 --> 01:15:15,052
Sir.

1324
01:15:16,554 --> 01:15:17,772
I will only ask once more.

1325
01:15:18,222 --> 01:15:19,474
Then what, boy?

1326
01:15:21,684 --> 01:15:22,772
Hey! Stop!

1327
01:15:22,852 --> 01:15:23,944
Get him!

1328
01:15:26,564 --> 01:15:29,362
Charge!

1329
01:15:56,177 --> 01:15:58,020
- Could that be her?
- I think so.

1330
01:15:58,804 --> 01:15:59,767
Daddy!

1331
01:15:59,847 --> 01:16:01,690
Daddy!

1332
01:16:02,725 --> 01:16:04,814
- Girls, girls, girls!
- Daddy!

1333
01:16:04,894 --> 01:16:07,318
Oh, you've grown so much. Stop it.

1334
01:16:10,024 --> 01:16:11,737
What made you decide to come back early?

1335
01:16:11,817 --> 01:16:13,781
I missed you. I missed you.

1336
01:16:13,861 --> 01:16:15,950
That sounds an awful lot like humbug.

1337
01:16:16,030 --> 01:16:18,283
- Fire!
- Move aside! Move aside!

1338
01:16:18,365 --> 01:16:21,163
- Come on!
- Hurry! It's coming from the circus.

1339
01:16:21,243 --> 01:16:23,666
Run! Let's go! Fire!

1340
01:16:23,746 --> 01:16:25,464
Girls, stay with me. Come. Quick, quick!

1341
01:16:32,588 --> 01:16:34,716
Everyone, stay close!

1342
01:16:39,261 --> 01:16:41,225
Phillip! Is everyone out?

1343
01:16:41,305 --> 01:16:43,019
- Is everyone okay?
- Yeah.

1344
01:16:43,099 --> 01:16:44,270
The animals? The animals?

1345
01:16:44,350 --> 01:16:46,022
Yeah, we set them free.
What else could we do?

1346
01:16:46,102 --> 01:16:47,314
W.D., where's Anne?

1347
01:16:47,394 --> 01:16:48,566
Where's Anne? Where's Anne?

1348
01:16:49,230 --> 01:16:50,903
No, Phillip! No!

1349
01:16:51,607 --> 01:16:53,946
- Hey, hey! Outside!
- You can't go in there!

1350
01:16:54,026 --> 01:16:56,120
- Anne!
- Phillip!

1351
01:16:56,487 --> 01:16:59,491
Keep pumping! Keep pumping!

1352
01:16:59,573 --> 01:17:01,792
- W.D.!
- Here she is! Here she is!

1353
01:17:02,118 --> 01:17:03,870
Anne! Oh my God!

1354
01:17:05,037 --> 01:17:06,083
Phillip!

1355
01:17:06,163 --> 01:17:07,506
- Phillip!
- Daddy!

1356
01:17:11,460 --> 01:17:12,678
- No, Daddy!
- Daddy!

1357
01:17:13,629 --> 01:17:14,630
Daddy!

1358
01:17:26,767 --> 01:17:28,269
Stay back! Please!

1359
01:17:39,822 --> 01:17:40,949
Daddy!

1360
01:17:48,414 --> 01:17:49,666
Stretcher!

1361
01:17:50,207 --> 01:17:51,334
Stretcher!

1362
01:17:52,626 --> 01:17:53,753
He's taken a lot of smoke.

1363
01:17:53,836 --> 01:17:55,088
He's still breathing. Come on.

1364
01:17:55,504 --> 01:17:57,632
Come on, let's get him on!

1365
01:18:01,218 --> 01:18:02,094
Up!

1366
01:18:34,793 --> 01:18:39,299
# What if we rewrite the stars? #

1367
01:18:43,052 --> 01:18:47,603
# Say you were made to be mine? #

1368
01:18:50,559 --> 01:18:54,610
# Nothing can keep us apart #

1369
01:19:01,070 --> 01:19:06,918
# You are the one I was meant to find #

1370
01:19:12,248 --> 01:19:13,375
Here we go, guys!

1371
01:19:14,083 --> 01:19:15,710
Come on! Straight ahead!

1372
01:19:19,129 --> 01:19:21,052
Thomas, help me break this up.

1373
01:19:34,270 --> 01:19:36,113
If you've come to gloat, I wouldn't.

1374
01:19:41,193 --> 01:19:43,287
They caught the thugs who started the fire.

1375
01:19:44,280 --> 01:19:45,623
I thought you'd like to know.

1376
01:19:56,834 --> 01:19:58,427
I never liked your show.

1377
01:19:59,962 --> 01:20:01,589
But I always thought the people did.

1378
01:20:02,548 --> 01:20:03,891
They did. They do.

1379
01:20:12,766 --> 01:20:14,439
Mind you, I wouldn't call it art.

1380
01:20:15,686 --> 01:20:16,562
Of course not.

1381
01:20:17,354 --> 01:20:18,230
But...

1382
01:20:20,274 --> 01:20:23,323
putting folks of all kinds
on stage with you...

1383
01:20:24,236 --> 01:20:27,706
all colors... shapes, sizes...

1384
01:20:28,032 --> 01:20:29,500
presenting them as equals...

1385
01:20:31,785 --> 01:20:34,459
Why, another critic
might have even called it...

1386
01:20:35,039 --> 01:20:36,882
"a celebration of humanity."

1387
01:20:39,043 --> 01:20:40,170
I would've liked that.

1388
01:20:40,711 --> 01:20:41,678
Mmm.

1389
01:20:45,257 --> 01:20:47,180
- Well, I hope you'll rebuild.
- Hmm.

1390
01:20:48,927 --> 01:20:50,429
I mean, thank God for Jenny's tour.

1391
01:20:50,512 --> 01:20:52,230
We can borrow off the profits, we'll be fine.

1392
01:20:52,890 --> 01:20:53,852
You don't know?

1393
01:20:53,932 --> 01:20:54,899
Hmm?

1394
01:21:02,608 --> 01:21:04,030
I'm sorry.

1395
01:21:15,579 --> 01:21:16,501
Charity?

1396
01:21:16,955 --> 01:21:18,047
Oh, God, Charity.

1397
01:21:18,332 --> 01:21:19,920
- I am...
- I don't wanna talk to you.

1398
01:21:20,000 --> 01:21:21,377
N... nothing happened. This is ridiculous.

1399
01:21:21,460 --> 01:21:22,507
Oh, sure. Nothing happened.

1400
01:21:22,628 --> 01:21:24,130
It's on the cover of every paper in New York.

1401
01:21:24,213 --> 01:21:26,635
Because she orchestrated the photo.
I'm not in love with her!

1402
01:21:26,715 --> 01:21:27,682
Of course you're not.

1403
01:21:28,342 --> 01:21:30,431
Not with her, not with me, not with anyone.

1404
01:21:30,511 --> 01:21:31,854
Just you and your show.

1405
01:21:33,764 --> 01:21:35,107
What are you doing?

1406
01:21:37,643 --> 01:21:38,940
I'm going home.

1407
01:21:39,478 --> 01:21:40,821
This is your home.

1408
01:21:44,775 --> 01:21:45,697
The bank...

1409
01:21:48,195 --> 01:21:49,492
they're evicting us.

1410
01:21:51,407 --> 01:21:53,705
Why didn't you ask me before...

1411
01:21:55,953 --> 01:21:57,421
I would've said yes.

1412
01:21:58,288 --> 01:22:00,757
I never minded the risk,
but we always did it together.

1413
01:22:40,205 --> 01:22:41,502
Figured you'd end up here.

1414
01:22:42,082 --> 01:22:44,176
Feeling sorry for yourself.

1415
01:23:00,225 --> 01:23:01,727
Folks, if you've come to get paid,

1416
01:23:01,810 --> 01:23:03,153
the money is gone. All of it.

1417
01:23:04,730 --> 01:23:06,357
- Nothing left to give you.
- Shut up, Barnum.

1418
01:23:06,440 --> 01:23:07,487
You just don't get it.

1419
01:23:09,359 --> 01:23:11,202
Our own mothers were ashamed of us.

1420
01:23:13,530 --> 01:23:14,952
Hid us our whole lives.

1421
01:23:16,366 --> 01:23:18,369
Then you pull us out of the shadows.

1422
01:23:19,495 --> 01:23:21,213
And now you're giving up on us, too.

1423
01:23:22,873 --> 01:23:24,091
Maybe you are a fraud.

1424
01:23:24,958 --> 01:23:27,177
Maybe it was just about making a buck.

1425
01:23:29,505 --> 01:23:31,633
But you gave us a real family.

1426
01:23:32,883 --> 01:23:35,887
And the circus... that was our home.

1427
01:23:40,182 --> 01:23:41,434
We want our home back.

1428
01:23:47,648 --> 01:23:49,651
# I saw the sun begin to dim #

1429
01:23:50,526 --> 01:23:53,905
# And felt that winter wind blow cold #

1430
01:23:58,158 --> 01:24:00,286
# A man learns who is there for him #

1431
01:24:00,869 --> 01:24:04,044
# When the glitter fades
and the walls won't hold #

1432
01:24:08,210 --> 01:24:10,304
# 'Cause from that rubble #

1433
01:24:10,963 --> 01:24:12,761
# What remains #

1434
01:24:13,590 --> 01:24:16,844
# Can only be what's true #

1435
01:24:18,929 --> 01:24:21,023
# If all was lost #

1436
01:24:21,765 --> 01:24:23,938
# There's more I gained #

1437
01:24:24,893 --> 01:24:27,317
# 'Cause it led me back #

1438
01:24:31,483 --> 01:24:32,484
# To you #

1439
01:24:52,462 --> 01:24:54,931
# I drank champagne with kings and queens #

1440
01:24:55,132 --> 01:24:58,432
# The politicians praised my name #

1441
01:25:01,388 --> 01:25:03,766
# But those were someone else's dreams #

1442
01:25:03,849 --> 01:25:09,447
# The pitfalls of the man I became #

1443
01:25:10,105 --> 01:25:12,358
# For years and years #

1444
01:25:12,691 --> 01:25:14,534
# I chased their cheers #

1445
01:25:14,943 --> 01:25:18,493
# A crazy speed of always needing more #

1446
01:25:19,281 --> 01:25:21,245
# But when I stop #

1447
01:25:21,325 --> 01:25:23,328
# And see you here #

1448
01:25:23,535 --> 01:25:29,167
# I remember who all this was for #

1449
01:25:29,249 --> 01:25:32,422
# And from now on #

1450
01:25:32,502 --> 01:25:36,132
# These eyes will not
be blinded by the lights #

1451
01:25:38,383 --> 01:25:41,137
# From now on #

1452
01:25:41,219 --> 01:25:43,347
# What's waited 'til tomorrow #

1453
01:25:43,430 --> 01:25:45,352
# Starts tonight #

1454
01:25:45,432 --> 01:25:47,396
# It starts tonight #

1455
01:25:47,476 --> 01:25:52,107
# And let this promise in me start #

1456
01:25:52,189 --> 01:25:56,194
# Like an anthem in my heart #

1457
01:25:56,276 --> 01:25:59,746
# From now on #

1458
01:26:00,614 --> 01:26:05,038
- # From now on #
- # Hey! #

1459
01:26:05,118 --> 01:26:08,834
- # From now on #
- # And we will come back home #

1460
01:26:08,914 --> 01:26:11,628
# And we will come back home #

1461
01:26:11,708 --> 01:26:14,928
# Home again #

1462
01:26:15,337 --> 01:26:17,551
# And we will come back home #

1463
01:26:17,631 --> 01:26:20,679
# And we will come back home #

1464
01:26:20,759 --> 01:26:23,888
# Home again #

1465
01:26:24,388 --> 01:26:26,685
# And we will come back home #

1466
01:26:26,765 --> 01:26:29,438
# And we will come back home #

1467
01:26:29,518 --> 01:26:32,691
# Home again #

1468
01:26:32,771 --> 01:26:35,485
- # From now on #
- # And we will come back home #

1469
01:26:35,565 --> 01:26:38,405
# And we will come back home #

1470
01:26:38,485 --> 01:26:42,115
# Home again #

1471
01:26:42,197 --> 01:26:44,620
- # And we will come back home #
- # From now on #

1472
01:26:44,700 --> 01:26:47,414
- # And we will come back home #
- # From now on #

1473
01:26:47,494 --> 01:26:50,589
# Home again #

1474
01:26:51,039 --> 01:26:53,003
# And we will come back home #

1475
01:26:53,083 --> 01:26:53,920
# From now on #

1476
01:26:54,000 --> 01:26:55,589
- # And we will come back home #
- # From now on #

1477
01:26:55,669 --> 01:26:59,344
- # Yes! #
- # Home again #

1478
01:26:59,840 --> 01:27:02,343
- # And we will come back home #
- # From now on #

1479
01:27:02,426 --> 01:27:05,223
# And we will come back home #

1480
01:27:05,303 --> 01:27:07,306
- # From now on #
- # Home again #

1481
01:27:07,389 --> 01:27:10,479
# From now on #

1482
01:27:10,559 --> 01:27:14,234
# These eyes will not
be blinded by the lights #

1483
01:27:16,481 --> 01:27:19,404
# From now on #

1484
01:27:19,484 --> 01:27:23,364
# What's waited til tomorrow starts tonight #

1485
01:27:23,447 --> 01:27:25,035
# It starts tonight #

1486
01:27:25,115 --> 01:27:29,539
# Let this promise in me start #

1487
01:27:29,619 --> 01:27:33,835
# Like an anthem in my heart #

1488
01:27:33,915 --> 01:27:38,382
# From now on #

1489
01:27:38,462 --> 01:27:42,135
- # From now on #
- # And we will come back home #

1490
01:27:42,215 --> 01:27:45,014
# And we will come back home #

1491
01:27:45,343 --> 01:27:48,347
# Home again #

1492
01:27:48,889 --> 01:27:50,977
# And we will come back home #

1493
01:27:51,057 --> 01:27:53,731
# And we will come back home #

1494
01:27:54,227 --> 01:27:57,026
# Home again #

1495
01:28:08,992 --> 01:28:09,955
You're here.

1496
01:28:10,035 --> 01:28:12,709
# From now on #

1497
01:28:12,954 --> 01:28:15,298
# From now on #

1498
01:28:15,749 --> 01:28:19,720
# Home again #

1499
01:28:21,087 --> 01:28:23,431
# From now on #

1500
01:28:23,840 --> 01:28:26,309
# From now on #

1501
01:28:26,635 --> 01:28:28,638
# Home again #

1502
01:28:31,807 --> 01:28:34,026
# From now on #

1503
01:28:34,476 --> 01:28:36,820
# From now on #

1504
01:28:37,187 --> 01:28:40,407
# Home again #

1505
01:28:45,987 --> 01:28:48,615
Caroline! He's here.

1506
01:28:53,662 --> 01:28:55,289
I would like to see my wife.

1507
01:28:55,705 --> 01:28:56,832
She's not here.

1508
01:28:58,667 --> 01:29:00,340
She's at the beach!

1509
01:29:28,572 --> 01:29:31,417
I brought hardship on you and our family.

1510
01:29:32,284 --> 01:29:33,376
You warned me...

1511
01:29:34,327 --> 01:29:35,624
and I wouldn't listen.

1512
01:29:39,082 --> 01:29:40,129
I just...

1513
01:29:44,296 --> 01:29:46,014
I wanted to be more than I was.

1514
01:29:50,886 --> 01:29:54,356
I never wanted anything
but the man I fell in love with.

1515
01:29:58,268 --> 01:30:01,647
# Let this promise in me start #

1516
01:30:02,898 --> 01:30:05,947
# Like an anthem in my heart #

1517
01:30:08,612 --> 01:30:10,285
# However big #

1518
01:30:11,072 --> 01:30:12,574
# However small #

1519
01:30:14,951 --> 01:30:16,078
# From now on #

1520
01:30:19,789 --> 01:30:20,961
From now on.

1521
01:30:54,616 --> 01:30:55,868
Bank said no?

1522
01:30:55,951 --> 01:30:57,038
Emphatically.

1523
01:30:57,118 --> 01:30:58,119
Repeatedly.

1524
01:30:59,829 --> 01:31:01,793
I don't think there's a banker
left in the country

1525
01:31:01,873 --> 01:31:04,467
I can fool into loaning me more money, so...

1526
01:31:07,712 --> 01:31:09,426
I'm really sorry to disappoint you all.

1527
01:31:09,506 --> 01:31:12,304
Don't worry, Barnum.
We've gotten used to it by now.

1528
01:31:12,384 --> 01:31:13,931
You know, Barnum...

1529
01:31:14,844 --> 01:31:16,096
when I first met you...

1530
01:31:16,763 --> 01:31:18,766
I had an inheritance, acclaim,

1531
01:31:18,848 --> 01:31:20,976
an invitation to every party in town.

1532
01:31:21,810 --> 01:31:24,689
And now, thanks to you, all that's gone.

1533
01:31:26,898 --> 01:31:28,069
All that's left is

1534
01:31:28,149 --> 01:31:31,824
friendship, love, and work that I adore.

1535
01:31:35,073 --> 01:31:37,417
You brought joy into my life.

1536
01:31:37,826 --> 01:31:39,920
- Into all our lives.
- Hear, hear.

1537
01:31:41,997 --> 01:31:44,125
If only the bank
would take joy as collateral.

1538
01:31:44,541 --> 01:31:45,508
They may not...

1539
01:31:46,626 --> 01:31:47,718
but I will.

1540
01:31:49,587 --> 01:31:51,305
I own 10% of the show.

1541
01:31:53,258 --> 01:31:54,885
Knowing who I was working for...

1542
01:31:54,968 --> 01:31:57,266
I had the good sense to take my cut weekly.

1543
01:31:59,514 --> 01:32:01,141
Phillip, I can't let you gamble it on me.

1544
01:32:01,224 --> 01:32:02,271
- I...
- Sure you can.

1545
01:32:03,268 --> 01:32:05,362
Don't turn sensible on us now.

1546
01:32:06,604 --> 01:32:07,526
Partners.

1547
01:32:09,232 --> 01:32:10,279
50-50.

1548
01:32:22,203 --> 01:32:23,204
Partners.

1549
01:32:23,955 --> 01:32:24,922
Yeah!

1550
01:32:25,665 --> 01:32:26,666
The only thing is...

1551
01:32:27,459 --> 01:32:29,257
I don't know how
we're gonna afford a building.

1552
01:32:31,046 --> 01:32:33,174
Right.

1553
01:32:35,884 --> 01:32:37,511
Building. We don't need a building.

1554
01:32:38,344 --> 01:32:40,597
Real estate in Manhattan
is a terrible investment.

1555
01:32:40,680 --> 01:32:44,145
Why, I can get land
down by the docks for almost nothing!

1556
01:32:44,225 --> 01:32:46,774
All we need is a tent.

1557
01:32:47,020 --> 01:32:50,115
- # Oh! This is the greatest show! #
- Come on, come on!

1558
01:32:50,940 --> 01:32:53,655
# Whoa #

1559
01:32:53,735 --> 01:32:55,112
# Colossal we come #

1560
01:32:55,195 --> 01:32:57,072
# These renegades in the ring #

1561
01:32:57,155 --> 01:32:59,283
# Whoa #

1562
01:32:59,365 --> 01:33:01,117
# Where the lost get found #

1563
01:33:01,201 --> 01:33:03,289
# And we crown 'em the circus kings #

1564
01:33:03,369 --> 01:33:06,088
# Don't fight it,
it's comin' for you, runnin' atcha #

1565
01:33:06,581 --> 01:33:09,209
# It's only this moment,
don't care what comes after #

1566
01:33:09,292 --> 01:33:12,421
# It's blindin', outshinin'
anything thatcha know #

1567
01:33:12,504 --> 01:33:14,050
# Just surrender 'cause you're comin' #

1568
01:33:14,130 --> 01:33:16,052
# And you wanna go #

1569
01:33:16,132 --> 01:33:19,097
# Where it's covered
in all the colored lights #

1570
01:33:19,177 --> 01:33:21,931
# Where the runaways are runnin' the night #

1571
01:33:22,013 --> 01:33:23,476
# Impossible comes true #

1572
01:33:23,556 --> 01:33:25,020
# Intoxicatin' you #

1573
01:33:25,100 --> 01:33:27,979
# Oh! This is the greatest show! #

1574
01:33:28,061 --> 01:33:31,359
# We light it up, we won't come down #

1575
01:33:31,439 --> 01:33:34,112
# And the sun can't stop us now #

1576
01:33:34,192 --> 01:33:35,613
# Watchin' it come true #

1577
01:33:35,693 --> 01:33:37,240
# It's takin' over you #

1578
01:33:37,320 --> 01:33:40,574
# Oh! This is the greatest show! #

1579
01:33:40,657 --> 01:33:43,830
# It's ev'rything you ever want #

1580
01:33:43,910 --> 01:33:46,708
# It's ev'rything you ever need #

1581
01:33:46,788 --> 01:33:49,542
# And it's here right in front of you #

1582
01:33:49,624 --> 01:33:52,922
# This is where you wanna be #

1583
01:33:53,002 --> 01:33:55,967
# It's ev'rything you ever want #

1584
01:33:56,047 --> 01:33:58,887
# It's ev'rything you ever need #

1585
01:33:58,967 --> 01:34:02,265
# And it's here right in front of you #

1586
01:34:02,345 --> 01:34:05,393
# This is where you wanna be #

1587
01:34:05,473 --> 01:34:07,812
# This is where you wanna be #

1588
01:34:07,892 --> 01:34:11,107
# Where it's covered
in all the colored lights #

1589
01:34:11,187 --> 01:34:13,777
# Where the runaways are runnin' the night #

1590
01:34:13,857 --> 01:34:15,570
- # Impossible comes true #
- This is for you.

1591
01:34:15,650 --> 01:34:16,946
# It's takin' over you #

1592
01:34:17,026 --> 01:34:19,905
# Oh! This is the greatest show! #

1593
01:34:22,949 --> 01:34:24,037
What will you be doing?

1594
01:34:24,117 --> 01:34:25,619
Watching my girls grow up.

1595
01:34:27,662 --> 01:34:30,877
- The show must go on.
- # We light it up, we won't come down #

1596
01:34:30,957 --> 01:34:33,546
# And the sun can't stop us now #

1597
01:34:33,626 --> 01:34:35,003

1598
01:34:35,086 --> 01:34:37,050
# It's takin' over you #

01:34:37,130 --> 01:34:39,803
# This is the greatest show! #

1600
01:34:39,883 --> 01:34:42,806
# Where it's covered
in all the colored lights #

1601
01:34:42,886 --> 01:34:45,683
# Where the runaways are runnin' the night #

1602
01:34:45,763 --> 01:34:48,603
# Impossible comes true,
it's takin' over you #

1603
01:34:48,683 --> 01:34:51,812
# Oh! This is the greatest show! #

1604

# We light it up, we won't come down #

1605
01:34:55,106 --> 01:34:57,359
# And the walls can't stop us now #

1606
01:34:57,901 --> 01:35:00,865
# Watchin' it come true,
it's takin' over you #

01:35:00,945 --> 01:35:02,948
# Oh! This is the greatest show! #

1608
01:35:03,031 --> 01:35:05,495
# 'Cause ev'rything you want
is right in front of you #

1609
01:35:05,575 --> 01:35:08,704
# And you see the impossible is comin' true #

1612
01:35:16,085 --> 01:35:19,050
# Oh! This is the greatest show! #

1613
01:35:19,130 --> 01:35:21,803
# Oh! Oh! #

1614
01:35:21,883 --> 01:35:23,260
Daddy!

1615
01:35:23,343 --> 01:35:25,596
# Oh! Oh! #

1616
01:35:25,678 --> 01:35:27,725
- # Oh! This is the greatest show! #
- Hey, girls!

1617
01:35:27,805 --> 01:35:30,979
- Hey!
- # Oh! Oh! #

1618
01:35:31,059 --> 01:35:34,188
- # Oh! Oh! #

1619
01:35:34,270 --> 01:35:37,399
# Oh! Oh! #

- # This is the greatest #

1626
01:35:56,376 --> 01:36:01,176
# This is the greatest show! #

1627
01:36:40,545 --> 01:36:43,219
# It's ev'rything you ever want #

1628
01:36:44,757 --> 01:36:46,976
# It's ev'rything you ever need #

1629
01:36:48,970 --> 01:36:51,974
# And it's here right in front of you #

1630
01:37:09,949 --> 01:37:14,874
# Look out, cause here I come #

1631
01:37:14,954 --> 01:37:19,545
# And I'm marching on to the beat I drum #

1632
01:37:19,625 --> 01:37:21,965
# I'm not scared to be seen #

1633
01:37:22,045 --> 01:37:24,467
# I make no apologies #

1634
01:37:24,547 --> 01:37:25,969
# This is me #

1635
01:37:26,049 --> 01:37:28,427

1637
01:37:30,970 --> 01:37:32,934
# Oh, oh, oh #

1638
01:37:33,014 --> 01:37:34,686

1639
01:37:34,766 --> 01:37:37,105
# Oh, oh, oh, oh #

1640
01:37:37,185 --> 01:37:39,609
# Oh, oh, oh #

1641
01:37:40,271 --> 01:37:43,650
# Another round of bullets hits my skin #

1642
01:37:44,233 --> 01:37:46,361
# Well, fire away #

1643
01:37:46,444 --> 01:37:49,664
# Cause today, I won't let
the shame sink in #

1644
01:37:50,198 --> 01:37:52,870
# We are burstin' through the barricades #

1645
01:37:52,950 --> 01:37:54,998
# And reachin' for the sun #

1646
01:37:55,078 --> 01:37:57,000
# We are warriors #

1647
01:37:57,080 --> 01:37:59,799
# Yeah, that's what we've become #

1648
01:38:00,708 --> 01:38:02,836
# Won't let them break me down to dust #

1649
01:38:02,919 --> 01:38:06,423
# I know that there's a place for us #

1650
01:38:06,506 --> 01:38:09,760
# For we are glorious #

1651
01:38:10,176 --> 01:38:14,181
# When the sharpest words wanna cut me down #

1652
01:38:14,889 --> 01:38:19,314
# I'm gonna send a flood,
gonna drown 'em out #

1653
01:38:19,394 --> 01:38:22,022
# I am brave, I am bruised #

1654
01:38:22,105 --> 01:38:24,569
# I am who I'm meant to be #

1655
01:38:24,649 --> 01:38:25,650

1668
01:39:02,770 --> 01:39:08,112
# There's nothing I'm not worthy of #

1669
01:39:08,192 --> 01:39:10,239
# Oh, oh #

1670
01:39:10,319 --> 01:39:13,789

1679
01:39:36,846 --> 01:39:40,770

1684
01:39:50,193 --> 01:39:53,697
# Gonna drown them out #

1685
01:39:53,779 --> 01:39:57,079
# Oh, oh, oh, this is me #

1686
01:40:00,411 --> 01:40:02,209
# You know I want you #

1687
01:40:04,207 --> 01:40:07,336
# It's not a secret I try to hide #

1688
01:40:08,169 --> 01:40:10,092
# I know you want me #

1689
01:40:11,839 --> 01:40:15,139
# So don't keep saying our hands are tied #

1690
01:40:15,801 --> 01:40:17,974
# You claim it's not in the cards #

1691
01:40:18,054 --> 01:40:20,893
# And fate is pulling you miles away #

1692
01:40:20,973 --> 01:40:23,646
# And out of reach from me #

1693
01:40:23,726 --> 01:40:25,440
# But you're here in my heart #

1694
01:40:25,520 --> 01:40:28,524
# So who can stop me if I decide #

1695
01:40:28,606 --> 01:40:33,157
# That you're my destiny? #

1696
01:40:33,819 --> 01:40:37,535
# What if we rewrite the stars #

1697
01:40:37,615 --> 01:40:41,370
# Say you were made to be mine #

1698
01:40:41,452 --> 01:40:45,168
# Nothing could keep us apart #

1699
01:40:45,248 --> 01:40:48,921
# You'd be the one I was meant to find #

1700
01:40:49,001 --> 01:40:51,004
# It's up to you #

1701
01:40:51,087 --> 01:40:52,680
# And it's up to me #

1702
01:40:53,089 --> 01:40:56,679
# No one can say what we get to be #

1703
01:40:56,759 --> 01:41:00,389
# So why don't we rewrite the stars? #

1704
01:41:00,763 --> 01:41:04,859
# Maybe the world could be ours #

1705
01:41:05,142 --> 01:41:06,143
# Tonight #

1706
01:41:13,359 --> 01:41:15,362
# You think it's easy #

1707
01:41:16,988 --> 01:41:20,993
# You think I don't want to run to you #

1708
01:41:21,075 --> 01:41:24,874
# But there are mountains #

1709
01:41:24,954 --> 01:41:28,794
# And there are doors
that we can't walk through #

1710
01:41:28,874 --> 01:41:30,838
# I know you're wondering why #

1711
01:41:30,918 --> 01:41:34,842
# Because we're able to be just you and me #

1712
01:41:34,922 --> 01:41:36,799
# Within these walls #

1713
01:41:36,882 --> 01:41:38,509
# But when we go outside #

1714
01:41:38,593 --> 01:41:40,515
# You're gonna wake up and see #

1715
01:41:40,595 --> 01:41:46,477
# That it was hopeless after all #

1716
01:41:46,851 --> 01:41:50,650
# No one can rewrite the stars #

1717
01:41:50,730 --> 01:41:54,485
# How can you say you'll be mine? #

1718
01:41:54,567 --> 01:41:58,115
# Everything keeps us apart #

1719
01:41:58,195 --> 01:42:01,994
# And I'm not the one
you were meant to find #

1720
01:42:02,074 --> 01:42:03,792
# It's not up to you #

1721
01:42:03,909 --> 01:42:05,707
# It's not up to me #

1722
01:42:05,870 --> 01:42:09,591
# When everyone tells us what we can be #

1723
01:42:09,874 --> 01:42:13,589
# How can we rewrite the stars? #

1724
01:42:13,669 --> 01:42:17,924
# Say that the world can be ours #

1725
01:42:18,007 --> 01:42:19,053
# Tonight? #

1726
01:42:19,133 --> 01:42:22,888
# All I want is to fly with you #

1727
01:42:22,970 --> 01:42:26,894
# All I want is to fall with you #

1728
01:42:26,974 --> 01:42:31,524
# So just give me all of you #

1729
01:42:31,604 --> 01:42:33,732
- # It feels impossible #
- # It's not impossible #

1730
01:42:33,814 --> 01:42:35,236
# Is it impossible? #

1731
01:42:35,316 --> 01:42:38,820
# Say that it's possible #

1732
01:42:38,903 --> 01:42:42,493
# How do we rewrite the stars? #

1733
01:42:42,573 --> 01:42:46,414
# Say you were made to be mine #

1734
01:42:46,494 --> 01:42:49,998
# Nothing can keep us apart #

1735
01:42:50,081 --> 01:42:54,086
# Cause you are the one I was meant to find #

1736
01:42:54,168 --> 01:42:55,881
# It's up to you #

1737
01:42:55,961 --> 01:42:57,800
# And it's up to me #

1738
01:42:57,880 --> 01:43:01,510
# And no one can say what we get to be #

1739
01:43:01,717 --> 01:43:05,517
# Why don't we rewrite the stars? #

1740
01:43:05,721 --> 01:43:10,944
# Changing the world to be ours #

1741
01:43:18,275 --> 01:43:20,369
# You know I want you #

1742
01:43:22,113 --> 01:43:25,288
# It's not a secret I try to hide #

1743
01:43:26,075 --> 01:43:28,419
# But I can't have you #

1744
01:43:29,995 --> 01:43:34,170
# We're bound to break
and my hands are tied #
