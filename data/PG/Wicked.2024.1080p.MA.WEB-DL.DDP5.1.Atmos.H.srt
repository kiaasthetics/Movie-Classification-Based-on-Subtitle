1
00:00:27,568 --> 00:00:30,530
Glinda, exactly how dead is she?

2
00:00:37,411 --> 00:00:40,915
Because there has been
so much rumor and speculation...

3
00:00:44,585 --> 00:00:46,921
let me tell you the whole story.

4
00:00:51,300 --> 00:00:53,718
According to the Time Dragon Clock...

5
00:00:54,971 --> 00:00:57,223
...the melting occurred at the 13th hour.

6
00:01:01,102 --> 00:01:04,689
The direct result of a bucket of water
thrown by a female child.

7
00:01:16,450 --> 00:01:19,787
Yes, the Wicked Witch of the West
is dead.

8
00:02:20,431 --> 00:02:22,641
Good news! The Witch! She's dead!

9
00:02:22,642 --> 00:02:24,768

Why does Wickedness happen?

60
00:05:55,980 --> 00:05:57,439
That's a good question.

61
00:05:57,440 --> 00:06:00,817
One many people find confusifying.

62
00:06:00,818 --> 00:06:03,445
Are people born Wicked?

63
00:06:03,446 --> 00:06:06,032
Or do they have Wickedness
thrust upon them?

64
00:06:07,158 --> 00:06:08,241
After all,

65
00:06:08,242 --> 00:06:10,328
the Wicked Witch had a childhood.

66
00:06:10,953 --> 00:06:11,953
She had a father,

67
00:06:11,954 --> 00:06:15,165
who, by the way, had been appointed
governor of Munchkinland.

68
00:06:15,166 --> 00:06:16,541
I'm off to the Assembly, dear.

69
00:06:16,542 --> 00:06:19,002

they had their secrets.

76
00:06:48,241 --> 00:06:50,367

85
00:07:23,568 --> 00:07:25,861
But from the moment
the Witch was born, she was...

86
00:07:25,862 --> 00:07:26,820
Dulcibear!

87
00:07:26,821 --> 00:07:28,655

00:07:28,656 --> 00:07:29,573

107
00:08:35,181 --> 00:08:39,726
It's all right, little one.

108

We'll look after you.

109
00:08:45,274 --> 00:08:46,191
Oh.

110
00:08:46,192 --> 00:08:48,735
So, her nanny,
Dulcibear, raised her.

111
00:08:49,820 --> 00:08:53,074
And as she grew,
so did her challenges.

112
00:08:54,075 --> 00:08:55,200
Dulcibear.

113
00:08:55,201 --> 00:08:56,744
Coming, Governor.

114
00:08:57,328 --> 00:09:00,873
Little one, watch your baby sister.
Just a clock tick.

115
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:07,796
Oh, Nessarose. Don't you worry. I'm here.

116
00:09:07,797 --> 00:09:10,382
Now, you want to see something amazing?

117
00:09:10,383 --> 00:09:11,299
Yeah.

118
00:09:11,300 --> 00:09:15,096
This is all about
our wonderful Wizard of Oz.

119
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:17,430
Do you know how he got here?

120
00:09:17,431 --> 00:09:18,766
No.

121
00:09:19,308 --> 00:09:22,603
From the sky. In a balloon. See?

122
00:09:23,354 --> 00:09:26,648
Then, he built a city made of emeralds,

123
00:09:26,649 --> 00:09:28,776
'cause he loves emeralds.

124
00:09:29,402 --> 00:09:31,278
Even though they are green.

125
00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:34,031
And Nessa, you want to know a secret?

126
00:09:34,532 --> 00:09:38,369
If you get to meet him,
he grants your heart's desire.

127
00:09:39,412 --> 00:09:42,163
Elphaba Thropp, green on top.

128
00:09:42,164 --> 00:09:45,876
Someone run and tell her
that everyone can smell her.

129
00:09:45,877 --> 00:09:49,546
- Ew, green and ugly?
- She's so green.

130
00:09:49,547 --> 00:09:52,716
Where did you come from?
You don't belong here.

131
00:09:56,137 --> 00:09:58,930
- She's as green as the trees!
- I do not like that.

132
00:10:02,393 --> 00:10:07,981
So green.

133
00:10:07,982 --> 00:10:09,191
Stop!

134
00:10:10,943 --> 00:10:12,527
- Elphaba.
- Ow!

135
00:10:12,528 --> 00:10:14,112
Elphaba Thropp.

136
00:10:14,113 --> 00:10:16,823
What have you done this time?

137
00:10:16,824 --> 00:10:18,617
Oh. That's okay. Come to Daddy.

138
00:10:18,618 --> 00:10:20,619
And now you've made your sister cry.

As you can imagine,

167
00:12:13,566 --> 00:12:16,359

I'm gonna go.

Glinda,

170
00:12:23,075 --> 00:12:25,076
is it true you were her friend?

171
00:12:25,077 --> 00:12:26,661
What?

172
00:12:26,662 --> 00:12:29,290
Sorry. One sec.

173
00:12:30,082 --> 00:12:31,082
What?

174
00:12:31,542 --> 00:12:33,793
Is it true you were her friend?

175
00:12:37,548 --> 00:12:38,549
Friend?

176
00:12:41,636 --> 00:12:43,512
Yes.

177
00:12:43,513 --> 00:12:46,182
I-I mean, I did know her.

178
00:12:47,934 --> 00:12:49,018
That is,

179
00:12:50,269 --> 00:12:52,021
our paths did cross.

180
00:13:03,115 --> 00:13:05,576
At school.

181
00:13:08,704 --> 00:13:10,039
But you must understand,

182
00:13:10,706 --> 00:13:11,916
it was a long time ago.

183
00:14:01,174 --> 00:14:02,007
Hi.

184
00:14:02,008 --> 00:14:03,091
Oh, it's Galinda.

185
00:14:03,092 --> 00:14:05,052
Hi! Galinda!

186
00:14:05,845 --> 00:14:07,637
\an8Oh, we're so proud of you!

187
00:14:07,638 --> 00:14:10,390
Thank you. I love you. Just remember,

188
00:14:10,391 --> 00:14:12,767
- it's not goodbye, it's farewell.
- We love you.

189
00:14:12,768 --> 00:14:13,977
- You have all your cases?
- Yes.

190
00:14:13,978 --> 00:14:15,312
- And you will write?
- Yes.

191
00:14:15,313 --> 00:14:17,480
- I love you. It's that time.
- My darling.

192
00:14:17,481 --> 00:14:18,398
Miss you already.

193
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:20,483
Popsicle, board the boat.

194
00:14:20,484 --> 00:14:22,861
They are gonna miss me so much.

195
00:14:22,862 --> 00:14:25,572
My parents don't even know I left.

196
00:14:25,573 --> 00:14:28,074
Uh... Uh...

197
00:14:28,075 --> 00:14:29,075
I'm Boq.

198
00:14:30,119 --> 00:14:31,453
I'm from Munchkinland.

199
00:14:32,747 --> 00:14:35,081
I know we don't really know
each other yet...

200
00:14:35,082 --> 00:14:36,959
- You know what I believe, Bick?
- ...but...

201
00:14:37,835 --> 00:14:39,003
It's Bick... It's Boq.

202
00:14:39,545 --> 00:14:41,088
That strangers...

203
00:14:41,756 --> 00:14:43,382
are just people I've never met.

204
00:14:47,303 --> 00:14:48,304
Bye.

What? What are you staring at?

215
00:15:41,816 --> 00:15:43,276
Do I have something in my teeth?

216
00:15:44,068 --> 00:15:45,319
No, it's just...

217
00:15:46,529 --> 00:15:47,529
You're green.

218
00:15:49,949 --> 00:15:51,324
I am?

219
00:15:57,540 --> 00:16:00,208
Fine. Let's get this over with.

220
00:16:00,209 --> 00:16:01,960
No, I am not seasick.

221
00:16:01,961 --> 00:16:05,630
No, I did not eat grass as a child.

222
00:16:05,631 --> 00:16:07,091
And, yes,

223
00:16:07,592 --> 00:16:09,177
I've always been green.

224
00:16:10,344 --> 00:16:11,345
Well,

225
00:16:12,430 --> 00:16:15,141
I, for one, am so sorry

226
00:16:15,725 --> 00:16:18,853
that you have been forced to live with...

227
00:16:20,271 --> 00:16:21,271
this.

228
00:16:21,272 --> 00:16:22,355
Is that so?

229
00:16:22,356 --> 00:16:23,441
Yes.

230
00:16:25,359 --> 00:16:27,068
And it is my intention

231
00:16:27,069 --> 00:16:28,987
to major in sorcery.

232
00:16:28,988 --> 00:16:32,909
So, if at some point,
you wanted to address the, um...

233
00:16:34,702 --> 00:16:35,703
problem.

234
00:16:36,454 --> 00:16:37,455
Problem.

235
00:16:38,164 --> 00:16:39,331
Perhaps I could help.

236
00:16:39,332 --> 00:16:40,999
Oh.

237
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:44,337
- She's so good. She's so good.
- You're so good. We love you.

238
00:16:45,254 --> 00:16:48,966
Thank you.

239
00:16:51,802 --> 00:16:53,470
All right.

240
00:16:53,471 --> 00:16:56,014
Offering to help someone
that you don't know

241
00:16:56,015 --> 00:16:57,642
with skills that you don't have.

242
00:16:58,309 --> 00:17:00,727
I'm sure everyone is duly impressed.

243
00:17:00,728 --> 00:17:02,562
I could care less what others think.

244
00:17:02,563 --> 00:17:04,481
- Couldn't.
- What?

245
00:17:04,482 --> 00:17:07,068
You "couldn't" care less
what other people think.

246
00:17:07,568 --> 00:17:08,569
Though, I...

247
00:17:09,153 --> 00:17:10,154
I doubt that.

248
00:17:10,946 --> 00:17:11,947
Elphaba.

249
00:17:11,948 --> 00:17:13,866
Elphaba Thropp.

250
00:17:15,367 --> 00:17:17,577
Ah. This is my younger sister, Nessarose.

251
00:17:17,578 --> 00:17:19,997
As you can see,
she's a perfectly acceptable color.

252
00:17:23,209 --> 00:17:25,920
- Oh, my God.
- Stop making a spectacle of yourself.

253
00:17:26,546 --> 00:17:27,754
I was trying to be nice.

254
00:17:27,755 --> 00:17:29,881
- You were so nice and good and correct.
- Did I do something bad?

255
00:17:29,882 --> 00:17:30,799
- I was...
- No.

256
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:33,760
- How did that come across?
- I don't see color, but...

257
00:17:34,679 --> 00:17:35,762
My precious little girl.

258
00:17:35,763 --> 00:17:37,223
Father.

259
00:17:39,267 --> 00:17:40,810
A parting gift.

260
00:17:46,566 --> 00:17:48,651
Mother's jeweled shoes.

261
00:17:49,318 --> 00:17:54,948
So they can all see how beautiful you are
right down to your toes.

262
00:17:54,949 --> 00:17:56,534
Thank you.

263
00:17:57,368 --> 00:17:59,578
Thank you so much. I love them.

264
00:17:59,579 --> 00:18:01,413
Let me put them with your boxes.

265
00:18:01,414 --> 00:18:03,165
Of course.

266
00:18:06,502 --> 00:18:08,254
I shouldn't have sprouted off like that.

267
00:18:09,630 --> 00:18:11,464
No, you shouldn't have.

268
00:18:13,217 --> 00:18:14,301
Today is...

269
00:18:14,302 --> 00:18:16,095
The start of your new life.

270
00:18:17,889 --> 00:18:19,557
New friends.

271
00:18:20,057 --> 00:18:21,726
New books.

272
00:18:23,603 --> 00:18:25,145
I'm excited for you.

273
00:18:25,146 --> 00:18:26,479
I'll miss you.

274
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:28,232
No, you won't.

275
00:18:28,858 --> 00:18:30,233
You'll be having too good a time.

276
00:18:35,907 --> 00:18:37,657
All new Shiz students,

277
00:18:37,658 --> 00:18:39,367
please report to the quad.

278
00:18:39,368 --> 00:18:40,870
- Don't help her.
- Don't help me.

279
00:18:44,332 --> 00:18:45,583
She'll be fine.

280
00:18:46,834 --> 00:18:51,422
All new Shiz students,
please report to the quad.

281
00:18:55,635 --> 00:18:58,846
- Hey. Nice to meet you.
- Hi. Nice to meet you too.

282
00:18:59,347 --> 00:19:00,430
We should head back.

283
00:19:00,431 --> 00:19:02,641
- Go with her.
- What?

284
00:19:02,642 --> 00:19:04,976
Just until she's safely settled
in her room.

285
00:19:04,977 --> 00:19:07,896
Make sure she has everything she needs.

286
00:19:07,897 --> 00:19:09,272
Father, she's on her own now.

287
00:19:09,273 --> 00:19:10,774
- I can't just...
- Just stop jabbering.

288
00:19:10,775 --> 00:19:12,235
Just do what I say.

289
00:19:14,487 --> 00:19:16,864
If anything should happen to her...

290
00:19:27,250 --> 00:19:30,168
Thank you
for your contribution to our university.

291
00:19:30,169 --> 00:19:35,257
And rounding out the rest of our faculty,
we have two scholars

292
00:19:35,258 --> 00:19:40,512
eminent in their respective fields
of forestry and agriculture...

293
00:19:41,931 --> 00:19:45,308
...as well as Professor Mombi
of the Biological Arts,

294
00:19:45,309 --> 00:19:49,313
and, of course, the head of our
History department, Dr. Dillamond.

295
00:19:51,816 --> 00:19:55,110
You know,
except for our wonderful Wizard,

296
00:19:55,111 --> 00:19:58,113
true magic has become all too rare,

297
00:19:58,114 --> 00:20:04,411
which is why we are privileged to have
our esteemed Dean of Sorcery Studies,

298
00:20:04,412 --> 00:20:05,996
Madame Morrible.

299
00:20:18,259 --> 00:20:19,260
Oh.

300
00:20:23,055 --> 00:20:24,056
Could you...

301
00:20:25,808 --> 00:20:27,225
I don't...

302
00:20:27,226 --> 00:20:29,561
Oh, my goodness.
It's really her.

303
00:20:38,613 --> 00:20:40,447
Welcome, new students.

304
00:20:40,448 --> 00:20:44,493
And congratulotions
for having been accepted to Shiz.

305
00:20:45,244 --> 00:20:49,624
Whether you'll be studying law,
logic or linguification,

306
00:20:50,208 --> 00:20:53,628
I know I speak for
my fellow faculty members

307
00:20:54,378 --> 00:21:00,091
when I say we have
nothing but the highest hopes

308
00:21:00,092 --> 00:21:02,135
for some of you.

309
00:21:04,847 --> 00:21:07,766
And now, Miss Coddle, if you please.

310
00:21:07,767 --> 00:21:11,645
I am Miss Coddle, Head Shizstress.

311
00:21:11,646 --> 00:21:15,816
And these are your dormitory designations
and room assignments.

312
00:21:18,277 --> 00:21:21,821
\an8Good luck, and welcome to Shiz.

313
00:21:32,792 --> 00:21:34,251
Madame Morrible, hi.

314
00:21:34,252 --> 00:21:38,880
I am Galinda Upland, of the Upper Uplands.

315
00:21:38,881 --> 00:21:41,174
If this is regarding room assignments...

316
00:21:41,175 --> 00:21:44,469
Oh, thank you so much, but I've already
been assigned a private suite.

317
00:21:44,470 --> 00:21:47,264
This is about my application
to your sorcery seminar.

318
00:21:47,265 --> 00:21:51,726
Perhaps you recall my essay,
"Magic Wands, need they have a point?"

319
00:21:51,727 --> 00:21:55,647
Well, dear,
I don't teach my seminar every semester.

320
00:21:55,648 --> 00:21:59,276
Of course, if someone very special
were to come along...

321
00:21:59,277 --> 00:22:02,613
Exactly.
This is why I wanted to talk to you. Um...

322
00:22:03,614 --> 00:22:04,866
We'll be in touch.

323
00:22:05,908 --> 00:22:08,661
There you are.

324
00:22:09,161 --> 00:22:10,871
- Miss Nessarose, isn't it?
- Yes.

325
00:22:10,872 --> 00:22:12,247
- The Governor's daughter?
- Mm-hmm.

326
00:22:12,248 --> 00:22:16,586
How tragically beautiful you are.

327
00:22:17,170 --> 00:22:19,672
It is such an honor to...

328
00:22:20,965 --> 00:22:22,174
I'm the other daughter.

329
00:22:22,175 --> 00:22:23,884
I'm beautifully tragic.

330
00:22:23,885 --> 00:22:26,511
The other daughter?

331
00:22:26,512 --> 00:22:28,680
Elphaba. What are you doing?

332
00:22:28,681 --> 00:22:31,933
Well... I wasn't made aware.

333
00:22:31,934 --> 00:22:34,269
- I know. I was just...
- Not to fret.

334
00:22:34,270 --> 00:22:36,522
Just a slight gulch.

335
00:22:37,607 --> 00:22:40,108
We'll find some place to hide you.

336
00:22:40,109 --> 00:22:42,862
I mean, house you.

337
00:22:43,529 --> 00:22:45,655
That won't be necessary.

338
00:22:45,656 --> 00:22:47,617
- I'm not enrolled.
- Oh, good.

339
00:22:48,242 --> 00:22:49,409
Why are you still here?

340
00:22:49,410 --> 00:22:50,952
I'm sorry, Nessa. Father insisted...

341
00:22:50,953 --> 00:22:53,663
Oh, the Governor made his concern
for your sister quite apparent.

342
00:22:53,664 --> 00:22:54,581
Wait.

343
00:22:54,582 --> 00:22:57,292
Please assure him
I am honored to help her.

344
00:22:57,293 --> 00:23:00,212
- She doesn't need your help.
- Stop. I just need to find my room.

345
00:23:00,213 --> 00:23:03,215
- I'll bring you there myself.
- Miss Coddle, I...

346
00:23:03,216 --> 00:23:06,009
- Now, you have an entire staff...
- Miss Coddle, I promised my father.

347
00:23:06,010 --> 00:23:08,553
- ...at your disposal 24 hours a day...
- Just stop, Miss Coddle...

348
00:23:08,554 --> 00:23:10,222
- ...seven days a week...
- She can do it alone.

349
00:23:10,223 --> 00:23:11,806
- ...365 days...
- Please, you don't understand.

350
00:23:11,807 --> 00:23:12,974
Stop!

351
00:23:12,975 --> 00:23:14,809
Let her go!

352
00:23:27,031 --> 00:23:28,199
No!

353
00:23:52,473 --> 00:23:55,476
This was my chance, my new start.

354
00:23:56,394 --> 00:23:57,979
I'm sorry, Nessa. I just...

355
00:23:59,272 --> 00:24:00,355
I didn't...

356
00:24:00,356 --> 00:24:03,985
Magic is merely the mind's attempt

357
00:24:04,569 --> 00:24:07,905
to wrap itself around the impossible.

358
00:24:08,531 --> 00:24:11,575
Yes, that was me.

359
00:24:13,411 --> 00:24:20,000
To prepare you to expect
the unexpected here at Shiz.

360
00:24:26,841 --> 00:24:28,383
- Did you visually see that?
- Yeah.

361
00:24:28,384 --> 00:24:30,135
I simply must get into her seminar.

362
00:24:30,136 --> 00:24:34,265
And speaking...
...of the unexpected.

363
00:24:41,564 --> 00:24:43,315
Which of you would volunteer

364
00:24:43,316 --> 00:24:45,525
- to share a room with...
- Ow. Ow.

365
00:24:46,611 --> 00:24:48,195
Madame Morrible, um...

366
00:24:48,196 --> 00:24:49,447
Thank you, dear.

367
00:24:50,323 --> 00:24:52,032
That is very good of you.

368
00:24:52,033 --> 00:24:53,117
What?

369
00:24:53,743 --> 00:24:55,953
- Miss?
- Elphaba.

370
00:24:59,290 --> 00:25:00,291
Elphaba.

371
00:25:02,502 --> 00:25:04,211
You can room with Miss Galinda.

372
00:25:04,212 --> 00:25:06,546
What? I... What?

373
00:25:06,547 --> 00:25:09,133
Now, go. All of you, go.

374
00:25:11,260 --> 00:25:12,261
Go.

375
00:25:13,054 --> 00:25:14,555
And you.

376
00:25:15,473 --> 00:25:17,390
- Come with me.
- Of course.

377
00:25:17,391 --> 00:25:18,684
Not you.

378
00:25:21,687 --> 00:25:22,855
You.

379
00:25:33,074 --> 00:25:37,285
I would like to teach you privately
and take no other students.

380
00:25:37,286 --> 00:25:39,455
Uh, thank you so much.

381
00:25:42,250 --> 00:25:43,875
- What happened?
- What happened?

382
00:25:43,876 --> 00:25:46,545
Something is very wrong.

383
00:25:46,546 --> 00:25:48,880
I didn't get my way.

384
00:25:48,881 --> 00:25:50,465
- I need to lie down.
- Yes.

385
00:25:50,466 --> 00:25:51,716
- I need to lie down.
- Get her.

386
00:25:51,717 --> 00:25:53,093
- Go, go, go.
- Just get her.

387
00:25:53,094 --> 00:25:54,761
- How?
- We need a pastry.

388
00:25:54,762 --> 00:25:55,847
We need a pastry.

389
00:25:56,097 --> 00:25:57,848
Thank you for covering for me.

390
00:25:57,849 --> 00:26:00,308
And I'm humbled by your munificent offer,

391
00:26:00,309 --> 00:26:02,102
but my father would never allow it.

392
00:26:02,103 --> 00:26:05,606
Leave your father to me.
I'll speak to him immediately.

393
00:26:06,107 --> 00:26:10,361
So, how long have you had this talent?

394
00:26:11,028 --> 00:26:12,529
Talent, uh...

395
00:26:12,530 --> 00:26:13,614
No, uh...

396
00:26:14,407 --> 00:26:15,741
Something just...

397
00:26:16,951 --> 00:26:19,203
Something just takes over me, and...

398
00:26:20,329 --> 00:26:21,831
Something I can't control.

399
00:26:22,498 --> 00:26:23,499
And when it does,

400
00:26:24,250 --> 00:26:25,626
bad things happen.

401
00:26:31,549 --> 00:26:36,179

All right. All right, everyone.
Settle down.

573
00:39:20,693 --> 00:39:22,986
Ladies and gentlemen, settle down.

574
00:39:22,987 --> 00:39:25,072
Quiet! Quiet, everyone.

575
00:39:26,073 --> 00:39:27,073
Now then,

576
00:39:27,074 --> 00:39:30,076
I have read your most recent essays,

577
00:39:30,077 --> 00:39:33,580
and I am amazed to report some progress.

578
00:39:33,581 --> 00:39:34,664
Thank you.

579
00:39:34,665 --> 00:39:39,628
Although, some of us still tend to favor
form over content, Miss Glinda.

580
00:39:40,713 --> 00:39:44,592
Oh. Actually, it's Galinda. With a "Ga."

581
00:39:45,092 --> 00:39:47,303
Yes, of course.

582
00:39:47,887 --> 00:39:49,638
Glinda.

583
00:39:49,639 --> 00:39:51,431
- No.
- Not even close.

584
00:39:51,432 --> 00:39:53,141
I don't see what the problem is.

585
00:39:53,142 --> 00:39:56,312
You know, every other professor
manages to pronouncify my name.

586
00:39:56,896 --> 00:39:59,147
Maybe the pronuncifi-cation
of your precious name

587
00:39:59,148 --> 00:40:01,733
is not the sole focus
of Dr. Dillamond's life.

588
00:40:01,734 --> 00:40:04,904
Maybe Dr. Dillamond
is not like every other professor.

589
00:40:05,404 --> 00:40:07,907
Maybe some of us are just different.

590
00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:12,619
Well, it seems the artichoke is steamed.

591
00:40:12,620 --> 00:40:14,329
Oh, my...

592
00:40:14,330 --> 00:40:17,332
The worst way to cook an artichoke.

593
00:40:17,333 --> 00:40:19,627
Quiet, please. Please!

594
00:40:20,294 --> 00:40:23,713
Yes, we goats lack upper front teeth,

595
00:40:23,714 --> 00:40:27,843
which accounts for the mispronunciation,
Miss Glinda.

596
00:40:29,846 --> 00:40:32,515
You see, indeed,

597
00:40:33,099 --> 00:40:34,684
some of us are different.

598
00:40:36,102 --> 00:40:41,481
Now, you may have noticed that I am one of
the last animal professors here at Shiz.

599
00:40:41,482 --> 00:40:46,027
And it isn't encouraged
to discuss this in our classes,

600
00:40:46,028 --> 00:40:49,197
but there have been some great changes
throughout Oz

601
00:40:49,198 --> 00:40:51,909
with the rejection of animal culture.

602
00:40:52,910 --> 00:40:55,705
However, there was a time,
before you were born,

603
00:40:56,247 --> 00:40:58,916
when life in Oz was different.

604
00:41:01,169 --> 00:41:02,919
When one could walk these halls

605
00:41:02,920 --> 00:41:06,173
and hear a snow leopard
solving an equation,

606
00:41:06,174 --> 00:41:09,176
or an antelope explicating a sonnet.

607
00:41:09,177 --> 00:41:13,889
So, when and why did this change?

608
00:41:13,890 --> 00:41:15,600
From what I've read, the Great Drought.

609
00:41:16,601 --> 00:41:18,811
- Okay, excuse me.
- Like, raise your hand.

610
00:41:19,395 --> 00:41:20,396
Precisely.

611
00:41:21,522 --> 00:41:22,689
Food grew scarce.

612
00:41:22,690 --> 00:41:25,525
And when people are hungry and angry,

613
00:41:25,526 --> 00:41:28,362
- well, then they begin to look for...
- Someone to blame.

614
00:41:29,739 --> 00:41:31,949
Quite right, Miss Elphaba.

615
00:41:35,786 --> 00:41:38,496
Yes, Miss Glinda?

616
00:41:38,497 --> 00:41:40,916
It is Galinda.

617
00:41:40,917 --> 00:41:43,210
Galinda. Galinda.

618
00:41:43,211 --> 00:41:45,378
And I don't see why
you can't just teach us history

619
00:41:45,379 --> 00:41:47,590
instead of always harping on the past.

620
00:41:48,633 --> 00:41:51,135
Because we cannot escape the past,

621
00:41:51,719 --> 00:41:54,096
and we ignore it at our own peril.

622
00:41:55,097 --> 00:41:58,266
The past helps explain
our present circumstances.

623
00:41:58,267 --> 00:42:01,938
For instance,
if we examine this timeline...

624
00:42:17,662 --> 00:42:19,872
Who is responsible for this?

625
00:42:26,087 --> 00:42:30,091
I asked, who is responsible for this?

626
00:42:34,720 --> 00:42:37,014
Very well. Class dismissed.

627
00:42:39,308 --> 00:42:41,477
I said, class dismissed.

628
00:42:52,989 --> 00:42:53,990
Dr. Dillamond.

629
00:42:55,116 --> 00:42:56,367
Miss Elphaba.

630
00:42:59,370 --> 00:43:01,080
Miss Elphaba, you don't have to...

631
00:43:03,499 --> 00:43:05,793
Thank you. You're very kind.

632
00:43:13,843 --> 00:43:14,844
Not bad.

633
00:43:19,724 --> 00:43:21,642
Poppies are my favorite.

634
00:43:22,310 --> 00:43:23,352
Mine too.

635
00:43:24,770 --> 00:43:27,523
They keep me cheerful in these dark times.

636
00:43:30,109 --> 00:43:33,153
Miss Elphaba, please.
Go and join your friends.

637
00:43:33,154 --> 00:43:35,364
That's all right.
I don't have any friends.

638
00:43:35,865 --> 00:43:38,159
Well, maybe one.

639
00:43:54,050 --> 00:43:55,384
Try again.

640
00:43:57,178 --> 00:43:58,596
Eyes shut.

641
00:43:59,472 --> 00:44:01,140
Toes clenched.

642
00:44:02,892 --> 00:44:03,893
Now...

643
00:44:05,436 --> 00:44:07,188
levitate the coin.

644
00:44:45,518 --> 00:44:47,270
It's all right.

645
00:44:48,145 --> 00:44:50,481
It takes time. Hmm?

646
00:44:57,280 --> 00:45:01,491
I hear there was
an unfortunate disturbance

647
00:45:01,492 --> 00:45:03,911
in Dr. Dillamond's class today.

648
00:45:08,624 --> 00:45:10,960
That must have been
so distressful for you.

649
00:45:11,669 --> 00:45:12,670
Well,

650
00:45:13,379 --> 00:45:15,381
someone wrote those horrendible words,

651
00:45:16,132 --> 00:45:18,384
on purpose, for him to see.

652
00:45:21,804 --> 00:45:23,055
I just wish I could...

653
00:45:23,598 --> 00:45:24,682
What?

654
00:45:25,391 --> 00:45:26,601
You wish what?

655
00:45:27,518 --> 00:45:30,145
I wish there were something I could do.
Because no one...

656
00:45:31,772 --> 00:45:34,358
No one... Do what?

657
00:45:38,529 --> 00:45:39,989
No one should be scorned

658
00:45:41,365 --> 00:45:42,533
or laughed at.

659
00:45:45,745 --> 00:45:47,496
Or looked down upon

660
00:45:49,332 --> 00:45:53,419
or told to stop jabbering and keep quiet.

661
00:45:59,634 --> 00:46:00,760
Remarkable.

662
00:46:01,886 --> 00:46:03,721
Absolutely remarkable.

663
00:46:05,598 --> 00:46:08,226
Once you learn to harness your emotion...

664
00:46:10,019 --> 00:46:11,521
the sky's the limit.

665
00:46:12,313 --> 00:46:15,024
It could lead you to the Wizard himself.

666
00:46:23,616 --> 00:46:27,078
- Have a good night, Dr. Dillamond.
- Goodbye, Dr. Dillamond.

667
00:46:33,209 --> 00:46:34,252
Dr. Dillamond.

668
00:46:35,586 --> 00:46:36,754
Did you find out who...

669
00:46:46,180 --> 00:46:49,099
...yet another incident here at Shiz.

670
00:46:49,100 --> 00:46:53,562
We animals are now being blamed
for everything that goes wrong.

671
00:46:53,563 --> 00:46:56,773
Forced from our jobs, told to keep silent.

672
00:46:56,774 --> 00:47:00,569
This is much bigger
than just some words on a chalkboard.

673
00:47:00,570 --> 00:47:03,780
We can still converse in private,
thank Oz.

674
00:47:03,781 --> 00:47:05,365
A dear friend of mine...

675
00:47:05,366 --> 00:47:07,659
- A deer?
- A cow, actually.

676
00:47:07,660 --> 00:47:09,870
She's been speaking out at protests.

677
00:47:09,871 --> 00:47:12,790
Recently wrote me,
asking to meet at a café.

678
00:47:13,457 --> 00:47:14,958
She said it was urgent.

679
00:47:14,959 --> 00:47:16,501
What did she tell you?

680
00:47:16,502 --> 00:47:19,462
She never showed.
And no one's seen her since.

681
00:47:19,463 --> 00:47:23,008
Many animals have gone missing,
or are actually leaving.

682
00:47:23,009 --> 00:47:26,136
Yesterday, a badger acquaintance,
a solicitor,

683
00:47:26,137 --> 00:47:29,181
was sacked, just for arguing a case.

684
00:47:29,182 --> 00:47:30,640
At least he can still argue.

685
00:47:30,641 --> 00:47:32,018
What do you mean?

686
00:47:32,560 --> 00:47:33,561

707
00:48:25,905 --> 00:48:28,407

Well, I was just...

711
00:48:44,090 --> 00:48:45,258
Don't be frightened.

712
00:48:47,218 --> 00:48:48,719
Let me get you some tea.

713
00:48:49,887 --> 00:48:52,265
Dr. Dillamond,
what you were saying just now...

714
00:48:53,641 --> 00:48:55,101
could that really happen?

715
00:48:56,018 --> 00:48:57,353
It is happening.

716
00:48:58,271 --> 00:49:01,398
You'll find if you make it
discouraging enough,

717
00:49:01,399 --> 00:49:04,277
you can keep anyone silent.

718
00:49:12,827 --> 00:49:15,580
But if animals are losing
the ability to speak,

719
00:49:16,163 --> 00:49:17,414
leaving Oz,

720
00:49:17,415 --> 00:49:19,457
then someone's got to tell the Wizard.

721
00:49:19,458 --> 00:49:21,126
Listen to me.

722
00:49:21,127 --> 00:49:23,920
You mustn't tell another soul
what you've heard and seen here tonight.

723
00:49:23,921 --> 00:49:25,798
But that's why we have a Wizard.

724
00:49:26,841 --> 00:49:30,051
♪ So nothing bad ♪

725
00:49:30,052 --> 00:49:31,428
Perhaps you're right.

726
00:49:31,429 --> 00:49:35,975
♪ Nothing all that bad ♪

727
00:49:36,559 --> 00:49:39,729
♪ Nothing truly bad ♪

728
00:49:42,648 --> 00:49:43,733
Sorry.

729
00:49:44,817 --> 00:49:45,818
Bad.

730
00:49:46,527 --> 00:49:48,446
I must be catching a cold.

731
00:49:52,575 --> 00:49:54,368
Oz bless you, Dr. Dillamond.

732
00:50:00,958 --> 00:50:03,586
You'd better go. Take the lamp.

733
00:50:19,227 --> 00:50:21,603
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa, there.

734
00:50:22,522 --> 00:50:25,315
- Whoa!
- I did not see her.

735
00:50:25,316 --> 00:50:27,526
Yeah, neither did I.

736
00:50:27,527 --> 00:50:31,614
- Um, you might want to, um, you know.
- Okay. Yeah, leave it with me.

737
00:50:32,281 --> 00:50:35,368
I'm so sorry, miss.
We didn't see you there. You must've...

738
00:50:37,203 --> 00:50:38,662
blended with the foliage.

739
00:50:38,663 --> 00:50:40,455
Is this how you go through life,

740
00:50:40,456 --> 00:50:42,959
just running amok
and trampling anyone in your path?

741
00:50:43,793 --> 00:50:45,877
No.

742
00:50:45,878 --> 00:50:47,922
No. Sometimes I'm asleep.

743
00:50:51,592 --> 00:50:52,802
All right.

744
00:50:53,469 --> 00:50:55,762
Here we go. No, I'm not seasick.

745
00:50:55,763 --> 00:50:56,930
Neither am I.

746
00:50:56,931 --> 00:50:58,640
No, I did not eat grass as a child.

747
00:50:58,641 --> 00:50:59,724
Oh, you didn't? I did.

748
00:50:59,725 --> 00:51:02,478
And, yes, I have always been green.

749
00:51:03,145 --> 00:51:05,439
And the defensiveness,
is that a recent development?

750
00:51:09,777 --> 00:51:10,778
Hmm.

751
00:51:16,534 --> 00:51:17,535
Oh, no, no.

752
00:51:21,330 --> 00:51:23,707
I'm off for some more trampling.
May we offer you a ride?

753
00:51:23,708 --> 00:51:25,835
No, thanks. Get stuffed.

754
00:51:27,503 --> 00:51:28,504
Well.

755
00:51:29,297 --> 00:51:31,506
Feldspur, we have just been
spurned by a girl.

756
00:51:31,507 --> 00:51:33,842
Hmm, indeed.

757
00:51:33,843 --> 00:51:35,678
I guess there's
a first time for everything.

758
00:51:37,054 --> 00:51:38,889
Attention, students.

759
00:51:38,890 --> 00:51:40,557
It is my honor to announce that

760
00:51:40,558 --> 00:51:45,562
Prince Fiyero Tigelaar of Winkie Country
will be filling out our student body...

761
00:51:46,647 --> 00:51:49,775
...having transferred from
the Royal Winkie Academy.

762
00:51:51,485 --> 00:51:53,321
Please help him feel welcome

763
00:51:53,863 --> 00:51:55,990
without making direct eye contact.

764
00:52:08,294 --> 00:52:10,212
- Hi.
- Hi.

765
00:52:10,213 --> 00:52:11,297
Hi.

766
00:52:13,132 --> 00:52:14,133
Hi.

767
00:52:22,141 --> 00:52:23,892
Enroll here often?

768
00:52:23,893 --> 00:52:25,603
Could I ask you...

769
00:52:26,521 --> 00:52:28,731
Anything. Anything you want.

770
00:52:29,273 --> 00:52:30,398
...just to move out the way?

771
00:52:30,399 --> 00:52:32,485
Absolute... Yeah, that's anything.

772
00:52:33,528 --> 00:52:35,947
- How are you?
- Hi. Yeah.

773
00:52:42,787 --> 00:52:43,788
Mmm.

774
00:52:47,875 --> 00:52:51,128
Are you looking for something? Or...

775
00:52:52,922 --> 00:52:53,922
someone?

776
00:52:53,923 --> 00:52:55,550
No, I was...

777
00:52:58,386 --> 00:52:59,595
What was I doing?

778
00:53:00,847 --> 00:53:02,014
How would I know?

779
00:53:02,598 --> 00:53:03,975
Our first fight.

780
00:53:11,816 --> 00:53:13,901
- Oh. Still here.
- Mm-hmm.

781
00:53:15,319 --> 00:53:19,073
Well, I promised to give a guided tour
to any recently arrived students, so...

782
00:53:19,574 --> 00:53:20,575
Hmm.

783
00:53:21,909 --> 00:53:25,912
Wait. Are you a recently arrived student?

784
00:53:25,913 --> 00:53:27,414
I am, yeah.

785
00:53:27,415 --> 00:53:29,207
Oh, I didn't know.

786
00:53:29,208 --> 00:53:33,212
Though, I'm not sure I'll last longer
at this school than any of the others.

787
00:53:33,838 --> 00:53:37,341
But I wasn't at any of your other schools.

788
00:54:07,538 --> 00:54:09,540
And this is the, um...

789
00:54:10,333 --> 00:54:11,417
the book place.

790
00:54:12,793 --> 00:54:16,546
There's a collection of, um, rare books
around here somewhere,

791
00:54:16,547 --> 00:54:18,382
and some medium rare as well.

792
00:54:19,175 --> 00:54:20,967
Well, there's so many to choose from.

793
00:54:20,968 --> 00:54:22,595
Right?

794
00:54:36,567 --> 00:54:38,401
So, what do you do for fun around here?

795
00:54:38,402 --> 00:54:40,570
Oh, well, nothing.

796
00:54:40,571 --> 00:54:41,821
Until now.

797
00:54:41,822 --> 00:54:43,490
You ever been to the Ozdust Ballroom?

798
00:54:43,491 --> 00:54:45,575
The Ozdust Ballroom?

799
00:54:45,576 --> 00:54:47,662
I mean, isn't that place somewhat illegal?

800
00:54:48,162 --> 00:54:49,621
And scandalocious?

801
00:54:49,622 --> 00:54:51,915
- Yeah, it is both of those things. Yeah.
- Hmm?

802
00:54:51,916 --> 00:54:54,835
It's also not far from here,
which is another plus.

803
00:54:54,836 --> 00:54:56,254
Whoa!

804
00:54:57,880 --> 00:54:58,965
You all right?

805
00:55:00,424 --> 00:55:01,551
Yeah.

806
00:55:03,719 --> 00:55:05,054
I'm Fiyero Tigelaar.

807
00:55:06,848 --> 00:55:07,889
Winkie Country.

808
00:55:07,890 --> 00:55:09,517
Oh, Oz.

809
00:55:10,101 --> 00:55:11,310
Boq Woodsman...

810
00:55:13,396 --> 00:55:14,730
of Munchkinland.

811
00:55:16,858 --> 00:55:18,024
Great.

812
00:55:18,025 --> 00:55:19,693
Excuse me. Good to know.

813
00:55:19,694 --> 00:55:21,236
Um, what were you saying again

814
00:55:21,237 --> 00:55:25,282
about the Ozdust and fun, and you and me?

815
00:55:25,283 --> 00:55:28,201
Um, unfortunately, it's against Shiz rules
to go into town after dark.

816
00:55:28,202 --> 00:55:31,162
I see that, once again, the responsibility
to corrupt my fellow students...

817
00:55:31,163 --> 00:55:32,874
...falls to me.

818
00:55:34,292 --> 00:55:35,668
Uh, excuse me.

819
00:55:44,468 --> 00:55:46,469
Whoa.

820
00:55:46,470 --> 00:55:48,181

01:08:41,120 --> 01:08:43,455
It is my heart's desire
to become a sorceress.

Thank you for having faith in me.

1031

Actually, I have no faith in you.

1032
01:08:50,296 --> 01:08:53,508
This is your roommate's idea, not mine.

1033
01:08:55,134 --> 01:08:56,301
I'm confused.

1034
01:08:56,801 --> 01:09:01,848
Miss Elphaba has requested
that I include you in our sorcery seminar

1035
01:09:01,849 --> 01:09:05,977
and insisted that I tell you
this very night, or she would quit.

1036
01:09:05,978 --> 01:09:07,062
Elphaba did?

1037
01:09:07,063 --> 01:09:08,605
Mm-hmm.

1038
01:09:08,606 --> 01:09:10,274
But why?

1039
01:09:10,774 --> 01:09:14,611
I'm a sorceress, not a mind reader.
I have no idea why.

1040
01:09:14,612 --> 01:09:17,072
But I can't risk losing her,

1041
01:09:17,073 --> 01:09:18,365
so here I am.

1042
01:09:19,450 --> 01:09:23,996
My personal opinion, dear,
is that you do not have what it takes.

1043
01:09:24,580 --> 01:09:26,165
I hope you prove me wrong.

1044
01:09:27,291 --> 01:09:28,542
I doubt you will.

1045
01:09:30,294 --> 01:09:33,256
Uh, you may want to thank her.
She just got here.

1046
01:09:33,965 --> 01:09:34,966
What?

1047
01:10:14,797 --> 01:10:16,917
What is she wearing?

1048
01:10:20,678 --> 01:10:22,263
What a ridiculous hat.

1049
01:11:12,146 --> 01:11:14,315
Her hat is disgustifying.

1050
01:11:18,361 --> 01:11:19,737
Oh, look at her go.

1051
01:11:22,698 --> 01:11:24,449
What does she think she's doing?

1052
01:11:24,450 --> 01:11:25,952
Is she dancing?

1053
01:11:43,469 --> 01:11:44,470
Whoa.

1054
01:12:23,759 --> 01:12:24,968
I'll say this much,

1055
01:12:24,969 --> 01:12:27,221
she doesn't give a twig
what anyone thinks.

1056
01:12:27,805 --> 01:12:28,848
Of course she does.

1057
01:12:30,516 --> 01:12:32,018

1058
01:12:40,109 --> 01:12:41,485

1059
01:12:44,113 --> 01:12:45,281

You're telling me
that was your first party ever?

1076
01:16:48,191 --> 01:16:49,609
Well, do funerals count?

1077
01:16:50,443 --> 01:16:53,320
That was funny.

1078
01:16:53,321 --> 01:16:54,405
Thank you.

1079
01:16:55,072 --> 01:16:57,908
- I couldn't remotely sleep.
- Neither can I.

1080
01:16:57,909 --> 01:17:01,953
I know. Let's tell each other
something we've never told anyone before.

1081
01:17:01,954 --> 01:17:03,623
Okay, fine. I'll go first.

1082
01:17:06,667 --> 01:17:08,336
Fiyero and I are getting married.

1083
01:17:08,836 --> 01:17:10,463
Oh, my God.

1084
01:17:11,797 --> 01:17:12,881
He asked you already?

1085
01:17:12,882 --> 01:17:14,300
Oh, he doesn't know yet.

1086
01:17:15,051 --> 01:17:16,636
Oh, okay.

1087
01:17:17,386 --> 01:17:18,929
Okay, now you tell me a secret.

1088
01:17:18,930 --> 01:17:20,973
- Like what?
- Like...

1089
01:17:22,308 --> 01:17:23,476
Like...

1090
01:17:24,310 --> 01:17:27,354
why do you sleep with this funny
little green bottle under your pillow?

1091
01:17:27,355 --> 01:17:29,314
- No, please, give that back.
- What is this? I wanna know.

1092
01:17:29,315 --> 01:17:30,899
- Give it back, please.
- I wanna know.

1093
01:17:30,900 --> 01:17:32,527
- Serious... Oh.
- Give it back!

1094
01:17:35,530 --> 01:17:37,198
It was my mother's. That's all.

1095
01:17:40,117 --> 01:17:41,535
Well, that's not fair.

1096
01:17:41,536 --> 01:17:43,287
I told you a really good one.

1097
01:18:05,893 --> 01:18:07,018
My father hates me.

1098
01:18:07,019 --> 01:18:08,604
What?

1099
01:18:09,105 --> 01:18:10,565
That's not the secret.

1100
01:18:11,148 --> 01:18:12,315
Oh.

1101
01:18:12,316 --> 01:18:14,527
The secret is that, um,

1102
01:18:15,403 --> 01:18:16,696
he has a good reason.

1103
01:18:26,497 --> 01:18:27,999
It's my fault.

1104
01:18:29,166 --> 01:18:30,418
What is?

1105
01:18:34,672 --> 01:18:36,424
That my sister is the way she is.

1106
01:18:40,511 --> 01:18:42,179
When my mother was carrying Nessa,

1107
01:18:42,180 --> 01:18:45,390
my father began to worry
that she might come out...

1108
01:18:45,391 --> 01:18:46,726
- Green.
- ...green.

1109
01:18:49,020 --> 01:18:53,441
He was so worried that he made my mother
chew milk flowers day and night.

1110
01:18:55,860 --> 01:18:56,861
Only,

1111
01:18:58,154 --> 01:19:00,781
the milk flowers made Nessa
come too soon, and...

1112
01:19:03,117 --> 01:19:04,785
and her little legs, they...

1113
01:19:08,122 --> 01:19:09,457
And my mother...

1114
01:19:13,002 --> 01:19:14,504
Well, she never woke up.

1115
01:19:16,005 --> 01:19:18,341
None of which would've ever happened
if it wasn't for...

1116
01:19:20,676 --> 01:19:21,677
for me.

1117
01:19:23,554 --> 01:19:24,555
So...

1118
01:19:25,973 --> 01:19:27,141
it's my fault.

1119
01:19:28,768 --> 01:19:30,436
What? No.

1120
01:19:31,437 --> 01:19:35,566
That was the milk flowers' fault,
not yours.

1121
01:19:37,652 --> 01:19:40,530
That might be your secret, Elphaba,
but that doesn't make it true.

1122
01:19:44,367 --> 01:19:46,160
Look.

1123
01:19:46,994 --> 01:19:48,371
It's tomorrow.

1124
01:19:53,292 --> 01:19:54,584
And, Elphie...

1125
01:19:54,585 --> 01:19:57,921
- Can I call you "Elphie"?
- Well, it's a little bit perky.

1126
01:19:57,922 --> 01:20:01,091
- I know. I know. I'm gonna call you that.
- I don't really...

1127
01:20:02,218 --> 01:20:04,219
And you can call me...

1128
01:20:04,220 --> 01:20:05,303
Galinda.

1129
01:20:05,304 --> 01:20:06,555
That is your name.

1130
01:20:06,556 --> 01:20:08,599
Let's not quarrel.

1131
01:20:09,392 --> 01:20:10,393
- Elphie?
- Hmm?

1132
01:20:11,269 --> 01:20:12,477
Now that we're friends...

1133
01:20:13,813 --> 01:20:16,147
...I've decided to make you my new project.

1134
01:20:16,148 --> 01:20:17,858
Oh, you really don't have to do that.

1135
01:20:17,859 --> 01:20:19,193

- Seriously?
- Do you need my help?

1219
01:24:45,668 --> 01:24:47,879
No! Just wear the "froat." It's pretty.

1220
01:24:50,590 --> 01:24:53,008

1221

01:27:23,284 --> 01:27:24,285
No.

1250
01:27:36,130 --> 01:27:37,548
You've been Galinda-fied.

1251
01:27:41,761 --> 01:27:44,055
You don't need to do that, you know.

1252
01:27:46,933 --> 01:27:48,768
Come on. Let's get to class.

1253
01:27:50,394 --> 01:27:52,646
- Dr. Dilly.
- Dr. Dilly, because you can't...

1254
01:27:52,647 --> 01:27:54,314
- Well, he calls me...
- Dr. Dillamond.

1255
01:27:54,315 --> 01:27:55,982
- It's not his fault.
- He needs to accept it.

1256
01:27:55,983 --> 01:27:57,443
He doesn't have upper front teeth.

1257
01:27:59,320 --> 01:28:01,530
Uh, Dr. Dillamond,
I picked you some poppies.

1258
01:28:01,531 --> 01:28:03,449
Not now, Miss Elphaba.

1259
01:28:04,033 --> 01:28:06,868
Please, everyone, take your seats.

1260
01:28:06,869 --> 01:28:09,372
I've something to say
and very little time.

1261
01:28:11,415 --> 01:28:13,250
My dear students,

1262
01:28:13,251 --> 01:28:16,545
this will be my last day here at Shiz.

1263
01:28:16,546 --> 01:28:20,298
You see,
animals are no longer permitted to teach.

1264
01:28:20,299 --> 01:28:21,383
What?

1265
01:28:21,384 --> 01:28:24,511
It's all right, Miss Elphaba.
I'll be all right. I...

1266
01:28:32,395 --> 01:28:36,064
Students, remain calm, please.
There's no cause for alarm.

1267
01:28:36,065 --> 01:28:37,566
What is this? What's happening?

1268
01:28:37,567 --> 01:28:38,817
Come on, goat.

1269
01:28:41,028 --> 01:28:41,945
Hey!

1270
01:28:41,946 --> 01:28:43,029
You can't permit this.

1271
01:28:43,030 --> 01:28:45,198
Miss Elphaba,
I'm afraid it's out of our hands.

1272
01:28:45,199 --> 01:28:46,783
They can take away my job,

1273
01:28:46,784 --> 01:28:49,286
- but I shall continue speaking out!
- Dr. Dillamond.

1274
01:28:49,287 --> 01:28:53,373
Listen to me!
You're not being told the whole story!

1275
01:28:57,795 --> 01:29:00,006
Are we all just gonna sit here in silence?

1276
01:29:02,300 --> 01:29:05,720
That's quite enough, Miss Elphaba.

1277
01:29:07,805 --> 01:29:08,890
Take your seat.

1278
01:29:25,698 --> 01:29:26,699
Students...

1279
01:29:27,283 --> 01:29:28,283
Are you all right?

1280
01:29:28,284 --> 01:29:32,663
...your new history professor
has prepared a special presentation.

1281
01:29:48,804 --> 01:29:51,349
Good afternoon, students.

1282
01:29:54,519 --> 01:29:56,937
- Good afternoon.
- Good afternoon.

1283
01:29:56,938 --> 01:29:58,688
In times such as these,

1284
01:29:58,689 --> 01:30:03,193
it behooves us all
not merely to study the past,

1285
01:30:03,194 --> 01:30:06,113
but to look to the future.

1286
01:30:10,034 --> 01:30:13,788
This is called a cage.

1287
01:30:19,710 --> 01:30:22,712
This remarkable innovation
is for the good of all Oz,

1288
01:30:22,713 --> 01:30:25,173
as well as for the animal's own good.
You see...

1289
01:30:25,174 --> 01:30:27,260
If it's so good, why is he trembling?

1290
01:30:32,056 --> 01:30:34,141
He's just happy to be here.

1291
01:30:35,893 --> 01:30:38,728
Now, one benefit
of caging an animal this young

1292
01:30:38,729 --> 01:30:41,649
is that in all likelihood,
he'll never learn to speak.

1293
01:30:42,275 --> 01:30:43,275
Oh, no.

1294
01:30:43,276 --> 01:30:46,152
The dimensions of the cage
will vary upon the size of the animal,

1295
01:30:46,153 --> 01:30:48,488
but the basic design remains the same.

1296
01:30:48,489 --> 01:30:50,198
Let me show you.

1297
01:30:53,244 --> 01:30:55,662
Can you imagine a world
where animals are kept in cages

1298
01:30:55,663 --> 01:30:57,330
and they never learn to speak?

1299
01:30:57,331 --> 01:30:59,041
This poor lion cub seems so frightened.

1300
01:30:59,750 --> 01:31:00,917
What are we gonna do?

1301
01:31:00,918 --> 01:31:02,586
Sorry, "we"?

1302
01:31:02,587 --> 01:31:05,506
Well, someone's got to do something.

1303
01:31:36,412 --> 01:31:39,207
Hey. Hey, hey. Hey, come here.

1304
01:31:41,751 --> 01:31:42,752
What is happening?

1305
01:31:44,045 --> 01:31:45,880
I don't know. I got mad and...

1306
01:31:48,132 --> 01:31:49,717
Fiyero, what are you doing?

1307
01:31:51,636 --> 01:31:53,471
Well, you coming?

1308
01:31:54,263 --> 01:31:55,389
Come on.

1309
01:32:00,520 --> 01:32:01,520
Look.

1310
01:32:01,521 --> 01:32:02,605
Come on.

1311
01:32:04,524 --> 01:32:06,192
Come, buddy. That's it.

1312
01:32:06,817 --> 01:32:09,445
- There we go. There we go.
- Yeah. All right.

1313
01:32:34,345 --> 01:32:35,638
What in the name of Oz?

1314
01:33:12,425 --> 01:33:14,218
I didn't mean to scare you.

1315
01:33:16,554 --> 01:33:19,389
Why is it you're always causing
some sort of commotion?

1316
01:33:19,390 --> 01:33:21,558
I don't cause commotions. I am one.

1317
01:33:21,559 --> 01:33:23,602
Yeah. Well, that's for sure.

1318
01:33:23,603 --> 01:33:26,688
So, you think I should just keep my
mouth shut? Is that what you're saying?

1319
01:33:26,689 --> 01:33:28,231
What? No. No, I'm saying...

1320
01:33:28,232 --> 01:33:30,025
- You think I wanna be this way?
- I...

1321
01:33:30,026 --> 01:33:32,235
- You think I wanna care this much?
- No, I mean...

1322
01:33:32,236 --> 01:33:34,279
I know my life would be much easier
if I didn't care, but...

1323
01:33:34,280 --> 01:33:36,115
Do you ever let anyone else talk?

1324
01:33:38,409 --> 01:33:39,410
Sorry.

1325
01:33:41,204 --> 01:33:43,244
- I was just...
- But can I just say one more thing?

1326
01:33:45,041 --> 01:33:46,876
You could've walked away back there.

1327
01:33:47,460 --> 01:33:48,460
So?

1328
01:33:48,461 --> 01:33:51,838
So no matter how shallow and self-absorbed
you pretend to be...

1329
01:33:51,839 --> 01:33:54,007
Uh, excuse me. There is no pretense here.

1330
01:33:54,008 --> 01:33:56,176
I happen to be genuinely self-absorbed
and deeply shallow.

1331
01:33:56,177 --> 01:33:58,220
Oh, please. No, you're not.

1332
01:33:58,221 --> 01:33:59,972
Otherwise, you wouldn't be so unhappy.

1333
01:34:09,482 --> 01:34:10,483
Fine.

1334
01:34:12,902 --> 01:34:15,238
- Well, if you don't want my help...
- No, I do.

1335
01:35:03,160 --> 01:35:04,912
What did you mean to do back there?

1336
01:35:07,665 --> 01:35:09,917
And why was I the only one
you didn't do it to?

1337
01:35:16,591 --> 01:35:17,592
You're bleeding.

1338
01:35:18,926 --> 01:35:19,927
Am I?

1339
01:35:20,720 --> 01:35:21,721
Mm-hmm.

1340
01:35:36,027 --> 01:35:37,028
There.

1341
01:35:42,033 --> 01:35:43,825
It must've scratched you.

1342
01:35:43,826 --> 01:35:44,911
Yeah.

1343
01:35:48,247 --> 01:35:50,374
Or maybe it scratched me or something.

1344
01:35:53,669 --> 01:35:54,795
I better get to safety.

1345
01:35:55,963 --> 01:35:57,423
- The cub.
- Mm-hmm.

1346
01:35:58,132 --> 01:35:59,341
- I better get the, uh...
- Of course.

1347
01:35:59,342 --> 01:36:01,262
- ...the cub to safety.
- Mm-hmm.

1348
01:36:07,850 --> 01:36:08,851

Come at once!

1381
01:39:48,529 --> 01:39:49,779
There!

1382
01:39:52,241 --> 01:39:54,744
Elphie, you gotta get down there. Come on.

1383
01:39:59,332 --> 01:40:02,667
Miss Elphaba,
I finally heard back from the Wizard.

1384
01:40:02,668 --> 01:40:04,044
Look!

1385
01:40:11,427 --> 01:40:14,012
- Oh. Stop.
- I know.

1386
01:40:14,013 --> 01:40:16,849
I... I just cannot.

1387
01:40:28,277 --> 01:40:30,071
It's yours. Open it.

1388
01:40:36,869 --> 01:40:40,372
"His Royal Ozness,
the Wonderful Wizard of Oz..."

1389
01:40:41,707 --> 01:40:43,875
"...summons you most ceremony-ishly

1390
01:40:43,876 --> 01:40:47,045
to his personal palace
in the Emerald City."

1391
01:40:47,046 --> 01:40:48,965
Uh, wait. Um, wait.

1392
01:40:49,549 --> 01:40:51,092
"This invitation is non-transferable."

1393
01:41:02,562 --> 01:41:05,523
This is your chance to make good.

1394
01:41:06,858 --> 01:41:10,110
Of course, you're going to have to
prove yourself first.

1395
01:41:10,111 --> 01:41:11,361
Prove myself?

1396
01:41:11,362 --> 01:41:13,029
Prove yourself worthy.

1397
01:41:13,030 --> 01:41:16,784
Dearie, this is the Wizard of Oz.

1398
01:41:17,577 --> 01:41:19,744
If he's gonna grant your heart's desire...

1399
01:41:19,745 --> 01:41:21,914
But prove myself how? I...

1400
01:41:22,707 --> 01:41:24,541
I'm not ready. It's too soon.

1401
01:41:24,542 --> 01:41:26,293
Don't be so pessi-mystical.

1402
01:41:26,294 --> 01:41:29,630
I, too, had to prove my powers
when I met the Wizard.

1403
01:41:30,214 --> 01:41:32,925
You'll find a way. I have faith in you.

1404
01:41:37,930 --> 01:41:41,142
Not to fret. Weather is my specialty.

1405
01:41:44,187 --> 01:41:45,688
Mustn't let you get wet.

1406
01:41:46,397 --> 01:41:47,939
Okay. I'll make a hand umbrella.

1407
01:41:47,940 --> 01:41:50,067
My hair. Thank you.

1408
01:41:58,492 --> 01:42:02,245
Not when you're on the cusp of greatness.

1409
01:42:32,610 --> 01:42:36,196
All aboard for the Emerald City!

1410
01:42:36,197 --> 01:42:38,907
Father, this is Boq,
the boy I wrote to you about.

1411
01:42:38,908 --> 01:42:42,994
Oh, yes. Governor Thropp,
good to meet you.

1412
01:42:42,995 --> 01:42:45,288
Oh, I've heard so much about you.

1413
01:42:45,289 --> 01:42:48,375
My Nessarose is very precious to me,

1414
01:42:48,376 --> 01:42:50,920
so you see you take good care of her.

1415
01:42:53,214 --> 01:42:54,549
I-I understand.

1416
01:42:55,675 --> 01:42:56,676
Good.

1417
01:42:58,553 --> 01:42:59,928
Elphie!

1418
01:42:59,929 --> 01:43:01,388
Elphie, the train is here.

1419
01:43:01,389 --> 01:43:04,474
And it came with the cutest little man
with a mustache. You gotta see him.

1420
01:43:04,475 --> 01:43:07,228
Oh, Elphie.
How will we manage without you?

1421
01:43:07,812 --> 01:43:09,229
You won't even notice I'm gone.

1422
01:43:09,230 --> 01:43:11,147
- Uh, you have Fiyero.
- Oh.

1423
01:43:11,148 --> 01:43:12,941
Um,
speaking of Fiyero, where is he?

1424
01:43:12,942 --> 01:43:15,026
Not that I expected him
to come and say goodbye, but...

1425
01:43:15,027 --> 01:43:17,529
I mean, we barely know each other.

1426
01:43:17,530 --> 01:43:19,781
Well, I barely know him anymore either.

1427
01:43:19,782 --> 01:43:21,284
He's been different.

1428
01:43:22,493 --> 01:43:24,495
He's distant and moodified.

1429
01:43:26,080 --> 01:43:27,789
And he's been thinking,

1430
01:43:27,790 --> 01:43:30,293
which really worries me.

1431
01:43:31,210 --> 01:43:33,044
It all started
the day Dr. Dillamond was fired.

1432
01:43:33,045 --> 01:43:35,672
I mean, who knew he cared so much
about that old goat?

1433
01:43:35,673 --> 01:43:38,341
Look. He did come.

1434
01:43:38,342 --> 01:43:39,593
Dearest.

1435
01:43:39,594 --> 01:43:42,680
We're over here, darling. Come.

1436
01:43:43,264 --> 01:43:45,308
Hi.

1437
01:43:46,184 --> 01:43:48,269
- Elphaba.
- Fiyero.

1438
01:43:50,146 --> 01:43:51,314
I'm happy for you.

1439
01:43:51,898 --> 01:43:52,899
Thank you.

1440
01:43:53,524 --> 01:43:56,359
Yes. We are both so happy.

1441
01:43:56,360 --> 01:43:59,738
- I've been thinking...
- Yeah. I heard.

1442
01:43:59,739 --> 01:44:02,700
...about the, uh, the lion cub
and Dr. Dillamond.

1443
01:44:04,619 --> 01:44:06,078
I think about that day a lot.

1444
01:44:07,246 --> 01:44:08,497
So do I.

1445
01:44:15,254 --> 01:44:16,422
Oh, me too.

1446
01:44:17,298 --> 01:44:19,633
Oh, me too. Me too. Mm-hmm.

1447
01:44:19,634 --> 01:44:21,302
I think about it constantly.

1448
01:44:21,802 --> 01:44:23,554
I mean, poor Dr. Dillamond.

1449
01:44:24,472 --> 01:44:26,349
It makes one want to...

1450
01:44:28,226 --> 01:44:29,560
...to take a stand.

1451
01:44:31,145 --> 01:44:33,396
In fact, excuse me.

1452
01:44:33,397 --> 01:44:37,068
Everyone. Please, I have an announcement.

1453
01:44:41,531 --> 01:44:43,615
I am changing my name.

1454
01:44:44,825 --> 01:44:45,910
- What?
- What?

1455
01:44:46,661 --> 01:44:48,286
- Your name?
- Yes.

1456
01:44:48,287 --> 01:44:50,121
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

1457
01:44:50,122 --> 01:44:54,960
Since Dr. Dillamond used to have his own
goat-like way of pronouncifying my name,

1458
01:44:54,961 --> 01:44:56,461
in solidarity

1459
01:44:56,462 --> 01:44:59,965
and in order to express my outrage,

1460
01:44:59,966 --> 01:45:03,761
I will henceforward be known
no longer as "Galinda,"

1461
01:45:05,263 --> 01:45:06,430
but simply...

1462
01:45:09,475 --> 01:45:10,600
Glinda.

1463
01:45:10,601 --> 01:45:13,103
Clapping!

1464
01:45:13,104 --> 01:45:15,272
- She's so good.
- Oh. She so is.

1465
01:45:15,273 --> 01:45:17,441
Such braverism.

1466
01:45:20,319 --> 01:45:21,319
Glinda!

1467
01:45:22,530 --> 01:45:26,032
Galinda no more,
Glinda henceforth!

1468
01:45:26,033 --> 01:45:27,869
Glinda, you're wonderful!

1469
01:45:30,413 --> 01:45:31,414
Glinda!

1470
01:45:45,386 --> 01:45:46,554
Good luck.

1471
01:45:54,020 --> 01:45:55,938
See? There.

1472
01:45:56,856 --> 01:45:58,190
What is that?

1473
01:45:58,191 --> 01:45:59,274
Don't be upset, Galinda.

1474
01:45:59,275 --> 01:46:02,194
It's "Glinda" now. Stupid.
I don't even know what made me say it.

1475
01:46:02,195 --> 01:46:03,570
It doesn't even matter what your name is.

1476
01:46:03,571 --> 01:46:05,822
- Everyone loves you.
- I don't care.

1477
01:46:05,823 --> 01:46:07,074
I want him.

1478
01:46:08,242 --> 01:46:10,828
I don't even think he's perfect anymore,
and I still want him.

1479
01:46:11,621 --> 01:46:13,706
This must be what other people feel like.

1480
01:46:14,790 --> 01:46:16,417
How do they bear it?

1481
01:46:17,460 --> 01:46:20,712
All aboard for the Emerald City!

1482
01:46:20,713 --> 01:46:22,631
The mustache man.

1483
01:46:22,632 --> 01:46:24,467
Hey, come on. The train.

1484
01:46:27,762 --> 01:46:28,763
Thank you.

1485
01:46:34,936 --> 01:46:36,771
Yes! We love you!

1486
01:46:50,576 --> 01:46:52,870
- Stand clear of the doors!
- Goodbye!

1487
01:46:58,000 --> 01:47:00,126
Oh. Wait.

1488
01:47:00,127 --> 01:47:01,796
Oh, excuse me. Um...

1489
01:47:02,421 --> 01:47:05,466
Elphie, here.
I forgot to give you this. Oh.

1490
01:47:06,926 --> 01:47:08,135
Bye.

1491
01:47:17,061 --> 01:47:18,979
- Come with me.
- What?

1492
01:47:18,980 --> 01:47:20,063
To meet the Wizard.

1493
01:47:20,064 --> 01:47:21,606
What are you saying?

1494
01:47:21,607 --> 01:47:23,692
Get on the train. You're gonna miss it.

1495
01:47:23,693 --> 01:47:24,985
I wouldn't want to impose.

1496
01:47:24,986 --> 01:47:26,778
It doesn't matter. Just come with me.

1497
01:47:26,779 --> 01:47:29,155
I couldn't possibly. This is your moment.
I'm coming.

01:55:20,336 --> 01:55:21,921
You can do this.

1595
01:55:22,797 --> 01:55:25,842
You can do anything.

1596
01:56:03,337 --> 01:56:05,338
- What is that sound?
- Oh, I don't know.

1597
01:56:07,842 --> 01:56:09,843
- No.
- No. Go... Go, go, go.

1598
01:56:09,844 --> 01:56:12,180
- Go. Elphaba. Go.
- I don't...

1599
01:56:16,642 --> 01:56:20,854
I am Oz.

1600
01:56:20,855 --> 01:56:22,272
Oh, Elphie.

1601
01:56:22,273 --> 01:56:27,069
I am Oz, the Great and Terrible.

1602
01:56:28,404 --> 01:56:30,030
Who are you?

1603
01:56:30,031 --> 01:56:34,367
And why do you seek me?

1604
01:56:34,368 --> 01:56:36,912
Elphie. Say something. Say something.

1605
01:56:36,913 --> 01:56:38,455
- What am I supposed to say?
- Anything.

1606
01:56:38,456 --> 01:56:40,666
- Say something.
- Um...

1607
01:56:41,250 --> 01:56:43,377
Say something.

1608
01:56:44,754 --> 01:56:46,297
My name is Elphaba Thropp,

1609
01:56:47,465 --> 01:56:48,465
Your Ozness.

1610
01:56:48,466 --> 01:56:49,841
And-And this is...

1611
01:56:49,842 --> 01:56:51,801
Elphaba, is that you?

1612
01:56:55,932 --> 01:56:57,015
Elphaba Thropp?

1613
01:56:57,016 --> 01:56:58,433
A man.

1614
01:56:58,434 --> 01:57:00,185
Elphaba Thropp?

1615
01:57:00,186 --> 01:57:01,604
I didn't know it was you.

1616
01:57:02,188 --> 01:57:03,689
You made it.

1617
01:57:04,690 --> 01:57:09,444
Uh. Sorry about all that.
I didn't mean to startle you.

1618
01:57:11,072 --> 01:57:14,659
You know, when I'm back there,
I cannot make out people's faces.

1619
01:57:15,952 --> 01:57:16,994
Well, it's just so...

1620
01:57:17,828 --> 01:57:19,288
It's so great to meet you...

1621
01:57:23,543 --> 01:57:25,710
- It's so great to... Hang on. What's that?
- What?

1622
01:57:25,711 --> 01:57:27,879
- I'm so sorry. May I?
- Sure. Yes.

1623
01:57:27,880 --> 01:57:29,173
Now, just... It's okay.

1624
01:57:32,844 --> 01:57:35,095
For you. My special guest.

1625
01:57:35,096 --> 01:57:38,849
That's a keepsake for you to cherish
for all of your days.

1626
01:57:38,850 --> 01:57:42,395
Very kind of you, Your Ozness. Thank you.

1627
01:57:43,187 --> 01:57:47,357
And this is,
uh, an additional unexpected...

1628
01:57:47,358 --> 01:57:48,733
Hi. What's your name?

1629
01:57:48,734 --> 01:57:50,111
Glinda.

1630
01:57:51,237 --> 01:57:52,488
The "Ga" is silent.

1631
01:57:53,072 --> 01:57:54,699
Hello, Belinda.

1632
01:57:55,283 --> 01:57:58,159
Uh, what you looking at there? Oh, yeah.

1633
01:57:58,160 --> 01:58:01,330
Ugh. Well, I don't know.
I think it's a bit much.

1634
01:58:01,831 --> 01:58:04,541
But, uh, folks have come to expect
that sort of thing.

1635
01:58:04,542 --> 01:58:06,836
♪ And you gotta give the people ♪

1636
01:58:07,879 --> 01:58:09,880
♪ What they want ♪

1637
01:58:09,881 --> 01:58:11,715
That's good. Thank you. Thank you.

1638
01:58:11,716 --> 01:58:16,219
But, if you think that's something to see,
wait till you see this.

1639
01:58:16,220 --> 01:58:20,641
I give you the Oz of tomorrow.

1640
01:58:26,147 --> 01:58:28,524
Yes. Yes.

1641
01:58:30,151 --> 01:58:32,360
Now, I don't know
if your eyes have already fallen upon

1642
01:58:32,361 --> 01:58:34,571
this long and winding path.

1643
01:58:34,572 --> 01:58:35,655
- Do you see that?
- Mm-hmm.

1644
01:58:35,656 --> 01:58:37,824
- I think people need direction.
- Hmm.

1645
01:58:37,825 --> 01:58:40,243
When this thing gets built,
everybody, always,

1646
01:58:40,244 --> 01:58:43,246
is going to remember
that if you just follow the road...

1647
01:58:43,247 --> 01:58:44,873
Follow the road.

1648
01:58:44,874 --> 01:58:47,584
It's gonna lead you right to me.

1649
01:58:49,086 --> 01:58:50,462
Recently, I've gotten a little stuck

1650
01:58:50,463 --> 01:58:53,715
trying to figure out what color
the bricks of that road ought to be.

1651
01:58:53,716 --> 01:58:56,218
So, I jerry-rigged this thing up,

1652
01:58:56,219 --> 01:58:58,638
- which does that.
- Oh.

1653
01:58:59,138 --> 01:59:01,932
Uh, Elphaba, you give that a whirl.

1654
01:59:01,933 --> 01:59:03,559
Oh, sure. Um, let's try.

1655
01:59:07,021 --> 01:59:09,064
What about green?

1656
01:59:09,065 --> 01:59:11,024
- Mmm.
- Um.

1657
01:59:11,025 --> 01:59:12,693
Yellow.

1658
01:59:13,277 --> 01:59:14,779
Maybe purple?

1659
01:59:15,696 --> 01:59:18,323
Wait. Just go back one, please.

1660
01:59:18,324 --> 01:59:19,783
The yellow, really?

1661
01:59:19,784 --> 01:59:21,576
- Yes.
- Huh.

1662
01:59:21,577 --> 01:59:23,119
It just says "road" to me.

1663
01:59:23,120 --> 01:59:25,080
Let me see. Huh.

1664
01:59:25,081 --> 01:59:27,040
And... Oh.

1665
01:59:27,041 --> 01:59:29,501
Yellow brick road?

1666
01:59:29,502 --> 01:59:30,919
I don't know.

1667
01:59:30,920 --> 01:59:32,712
- Oh, hey. Come up here.
- Oh.

1668
01:59:32,713 --> 01:59:35,590
Come up here with me in my sandbox.

1669
01:59:35,591 --> 01:59:37,342
Step right up. Watch this.

1670
01:59:37,343 --> 01:59:42,723
So here's where we are,
and when we open it up, inside...

1671
01:59:43,599 --> 01:59:44,599
That's you.

1672
01:59:44,600 --> 01:59:45,809
Well, it is me.

1673
01:59:45,810 --> 01:59:47,269
Yeah, it is me.

1674
01:59:47,270 --> 01:59:48,520
I like it. I shouldn't.

1675
01:59:48,521 --> 01:59:49,980
I'm here by myself a lot.

1676
01:59:49,981 --> 01:59:52,066
Anyway. I don't, uh... Oh.

1677
01:59:53,234 --> 01:59:54,234
I forgot.

1678
01:59:54,235 --> 01:59:56,403
If my head wasn't attached, it would, uh...

1679
01:59:56,404 --> 01:59:59,447
I'd... I'd leave it in, uh, Munchkinland.

1680
01:59:59,448 --> 02:00:01,742
Hey, you know what I had made?
Look. Special.

1681
02:00:05,663 --> 02:00:07,080
Keep that.

1682
02:00:07,081 --> 02:00:09,332
I... No, I mean it.
Keep it... Keep it forever.

1683
02:00:09,333 --> 02:00:12,377
Because at some point, who knows?

1684
02:00:12,378 --> 02:00:17,632
We might be putting your little artifact
in there right next to mine.

1685
02:00:17,633 --> 02:00:18,842
Because maybe someday,

1686
02:00:18,843 --> 02:00:23,097
you're gonna be calling
this whole pile of stones your home.

1687
02:00:26,100 --> 02:00:27,101
Elphie.

1688
02:00:29,562 --> 02:00:31,104
She's green.

1689
02:00:31,105 --> 02:00:32,356
Oh, well...

1690
02:00:32,982 --> 02:00:34,900
she doesn't have to be.

1691
02:00:34,901 --> 02:00:37,737
Would that be your... your heart's desire?

1692
02:00:47,997 --> 02:00:48,998
No.

1693
02:00:52,502 --> 02:00:53,503
No.

1694
02:00:55,755 --> 02:00:58,132
My heart's desire
is for you to help the animals.

1695
02:00:58,841 --> 02:01:01,260
Something bad is happening to them,
and they need you.

1696
02:01:02,053 --> 02:01:04,346
I had a feeling you were gonna say that.

1697
02:01:04,347 --> 02:01:06,389
And I agree wholeheartedly.

1698
02:01:06,390 --> 02:01:08,767
Yeah. Wow, that's the darndest thing.

1699
02:01:08,768 --> 02:01:12,522
It's almost like I, uh...
I already know you.

1700
02:01:13,231 --> 02:01:15,358
I knew you'd understand.

1701
02:01:16,609 --> 02:01:19,110
That makes me... That makes me so happy.

1702
02:01:19,111 --> 02:01:23,491
Well, that's what I love best.

Uh, uh, away with the moon.

1718
02:03:10,097 --> 02:03:11,724
- Huh.
- Is that...

1719
02:03:13,518 --> 02:03:15,393
- Oh, it is.
- It is.

1720
02:03:15,394 --> 02:03:18,439
Madame Morrible,
what are you doing here?

1721
02:03:19,023 --> 02:03:21,691
Oh, dearie.

1722
02:03:21,692 --> 02:03:23,736
I couldn't miss your big moment.

1723
02:03:29,408 --> 02:03:32,244
Neither could you, I see. Hmm.

1724
02:03:32,245 --> 02:03:33,329
I...

1725
02:03:42,713 --> 02:03:44,882
I don't believe it.

1726
02:03:45,508 --> 02:03:47,009
Is that the Grimmerie?

1727
02:03:47,844 --> 02:03:48,845
Yes.

1728
02:03:50,471 --> 02:03:55,268
That's the ancient book of wisdom,
thaumaturgy and enchantments.

1729
02:04:07,321 --> 02:04:08,656
Can I touch it?

1730
02:04:10,074 --> 02:04:11,075
No.

1731
02:04:12,869 --> 02:04:14,870
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

1732
02:04:14,871 --> 02:04:16,538
She may not be ready.

1733
02:04:16,539 --> 02:04:21,169
Casting a spell with the Grimmerie,
that's a mighty tall order.

1734
02:04:21,961 --> 02:04:23,253
I... You know, I should know.

1735
02:04:23,254 --> 02:04:25,297
You're right. We mustn't rush her.

1736
02:04:25,298 --> 02:04:27,257
Perhaps today has been too overwhelming.

1737
02:04:27,258 --> 02:04:28,675
No.

1738
02:04:28,676 --> 02:04:29,760
Please.

1739
02:04:30,887 --> 02:04:32,054
Let me try.

1740
02:04:33,264 --> 02:04:34,682
Let me prove myself.

1741
02:04:35,850 --> 02:04:36,850
Well...

1742
02:04:59,582 --> 02:05:01,750
Sweet Oz.

1743
02:05:01,751 --> 02:05:03,628
It opened for her.

1744
02:05:17,308 --> 02:05:19,809
So, which spell are you gonna start with?

1745
02:05:19,810 --> 02:05:22,562
We've been working on levitation.

1746
02:05:22,563 --> 02:05:26,316
Levitation? Oh, that's interesting.

1747
02:05:26,317 --> 02:05:29,904
Do you know that, um, Chistery here...

1748
02:05:30,613 --> 02:05:33,615
Ha... Have you ladies met, uh, Ch-Chistery,

1749
02:05:33,616 --> 02:05:36,494
the leader of my... my Emerald Guards?

1750
02:05:37,078 --> 02:05:38,370
Pleased to meet you.

1751
02:05:38,371 --> 02:05:40,205
Uh, he'd hate to admit this.

1752
02:05:40,206 --> 02:05:41,916
Does not like talking about himself.

1753
02:05:42,667 --> 02:05:47,587
But he watches birds so longingly

1754
02:05:47,588 --> 02:05:49,214
every morning.

1755
02:05:49,215 --> 02:05:50,591
Birds?

1756
02:05:52,218 --> 02:05:54,762
- How can I help him? I-I don't...
- Elphie, look.

1757
02:06:02,103 --> 02:06:03,896
Are those words?

1758
02:06:06,440 --> 02:06:08,358
The lost language.

1759
02:06:08,359 --> 02:06:11,237
Our lost language of spells.

1760
02:06:11,821 --> 02:06:15,199
Don't be discouraged
if you can't decipher it.

1761
02:06:16,033 --> 02:06:20,036
Dearie, I, myself,
can only read a word or two,

1762
02:06:20,037 --> 02:06:21,788
and that took years.

1763
02:06:27,461 --> 02:06:29,130
- Oh, Elphie.
- Praise Oz.

1764
02:06:48,774 --> 02:06:49,942
What did I tell you?

1765
02:07:04,457 --> 02:07:05,707
Chistery, are you all right?

1766
02:07:05,708 --> 02:07:07,502
Chistery?

1767
02:07:10,838 --> 02:07:12,756
It's just the transition, dearie.

1768
02:07:12,757 --> 02:07:14,467
It's just the transition.

1769
02:07:25,019 --> 02:07:26,229
Oh.

1770
02:07:29,815 --> 02:07:31,150
But it's hurting him.

1771
02:07:32,318 --> 02:07:33,193
Chistery.

1772
02:07:33,194 --> 02:07:34,779
Don't bite. Don't bite.

1773
02:08:04,976 --> 02:08:06,351
Glory-osky.

1774
02:08:06,352 --> 02:08:09,438
You did it. You actually did it.

1775
02:08:20,491 --> 02:08:21,825
He's in pain.

1776
02:08:21,826 --> 02:08:23,410
Quick. How do I reverse it?

1777
02:08:23,411 --> 02:08:25,453
- Reverse...
- How do I reverse it?

1778
02:08:25,454 --> 02:08:28,082
A spell from the Grimmerie
can never be reversed.

1779
02:08:32,503 --> 02:08:35,172
Elphaba. Elphaba.

1780
02:08:35,173 --> 02:08:36,632
No. No!

1781
02:08:54,150 --> 02:08:57,152
I knew she had the power. I told you.

1782
02:08:57,153 --> 02:08:58,904
Elphie, this is astoundifying.

1783
02:08:58,905 --> 02:09:01,239
It's just what we hoped for.
Eyes in the skies.

1784
02:09:01,240 --> 02:09:04,451
Yes. They'll make perfect spies.

1785
02:09:04,452 --> 02:09:05,536
Spies?

1786
02:09:07,371 --> 02:09:09,748
- Elphaba? Elphaba?
- Oh, uh, no. No. Uh...

1787
02:09:09,749 --> 02:09:12,126
Elphie? Elphie?

1788
02:09:14,170 --> 02:09:15,545
You're right. That's a very harsh word.

1789
02:09:15,546 --> 02:09:18,423
Oh, "scouts." What about "scouts"?
Because they're gonna be flying around Oz

1790
02:09:18,424 --> 02:09:20,258
reporting back
on any seditious animal activity...

1791
02:09:20,259 --> 02:09:22,135
Seditious animal activity?
What does that mean?

1792
02:09:22,136 --> 02:09:25,181
Elphie. I'm sure the Wizard
has a good reason.

1793
02:09:29,852 --> 02:09:30,978
It's you.

1794
02:09:32,438 --> 02:09:33,773
You're behind all of this.

1795
02:09:35,191 --> 02:09:37,567
You're the reason why
people are turning against the animals.

1796
02:09:37,568 --> 02:09:38,945
You... It's all because of you.

1797
02:09:40,613 --> 02:09:42,405
We're doing this to keep people safe.

1798
02:09:42,406 --> 02:09:44,408
All of Oz will benefit.

1799
02:09:44,992 --> 02:09:46,077
And you've known all along.

1800
02:09:47,787 --> 02:09:49,247
Since the day you met me.

1801
02:09:49,830 --> 02:09:52,499
You will benefit too, dearie.

1802
02:09:52,500 --> 02:09:54,751
- You must trust me.
- Don't. Don't.

1803
02:09:54,752 --> 02:09:56,253
El-Elphaba.

1804
02:09:56,254 --> 02:09:59,798
When I first got here, well,
there was discord.

1805
02:09:59,799 --> 02:10:01,091
There was discontent.

1806
02:10:01,092 --> 02:10:03,176
And back where I come from,

1807
02:10:03,177 --> 02:10:07,682
everybody knows that the best way
to bring folks together

1808
02:10:08,349 --> 02:10:11,811
is to give them a... a real good enemy.

1809
02:10:12,812 --> 02:10:15,397
If you wanted s-spies,
why wouldn't you just...

1810
02:10:15,398 --> 02:10:17,598
why wouldn't you just
make them yourself? You...

1811
02:10:26,617 --> 02:10:27,702
Elphaba.

1812
02:10:28,619 --> 02:10:29,704
Elphaba.

1813
02:10:30,454 --> 02:10:32,665
You are talking to the Wizard of Oz.

1814
02:10:35,251 --> 02:10:36,168
Read it.

1815
02:10:36,169 --> 02:10:38,211
Cast a spell.

1816
02:10:38,212 --> 02:10:40,088
Read it!

1817
02:10:40,089 --> 02:10:41,507
- Elphaba.
- Don't...

1818
02:10:46,304 --> 02:10:47,930
You can't, can you?

1819
02:10:50,266 --> 02:10:51,601
Can you?

1820
02:10:58,357 --> 02:10:59,983
That's why you need all of this.

1821
02:10:59,984 --> 02:11:03,778
And you need spies
and-and animals in cages and an enemy.

1822
02:11:03,779 --> 02:11:05,238
You...

1823
02:11:05,239 --> 02:11:06,824
You have no real power.

1824
02:11:07,617 --> 02:11:09,326
Exactly.

1825
02:11:09,327 --> 02:11:10,869
That's why I need you.

1826
02:11:10,870 --> 02:11:14,915
Think of your future, dearie.

1827
02:11:14,916 --> 02:11:16,209
Stay back.

1828
02:11:18,961 --> 02:11:20,379
Elphie, listen to them.

1829
02:11:22,590 --> 02:11:23,758
Please.

1830
02:11:24,425 --> 02:11:25,842
Good advice, young lady.

1831
02:11:25,843 --> 02:11:27,385
Listen, uh, Elphaba,

1832
02:11:27,386 --> 02:11:32,098
if you can pull this off
first crack out of the box...

1833
02:11:32,099 --> 02:11:36,102
Oh. Oh, my golly. I can't even imagine...

1834
02:11:36,103 --> 02:11:39,523
And I meant every word
about you having a home here.

1835
02:11:39,524 --> 02:11:41,983
It's gonna be you and me

1836
02:11:41,984 --> 02:11:45,153
and, hey, if it'd make you happy,

1837
02:11:45,154 --> 02:11:48,240
possibly your friend.

1838
02:11:48,241 --> 02:11:49,492
Really?

1839
02:11:50,868 --> 02:11:52,078
Why not?

1840
02:11:53,829 --> 02:11:55,373
No.

1841
02:11:57,416 --> 02:11:59,376
Elphaba.

1842
02:11:59,377 --> 02:12:02,171
You want to do yourself some good?
Get her back.

1843
02:12:05,424 --> 02:12:07,718
Elphie. Elphie!

1844
02:12:14,475 --> 02:12:15,476
Listen.

1845
02:12:20,231 --> 02:12:21,566
Listen!

1846
02:12:23,109 --> 02:12:25,902
If you want to keep your families safe,

1847
02:12:25,903 --> 02:12:28,739
you'll stay loyal to our Wizard.

1848
02:12:29,323 --> 02:12:32,200
She did this! The green one.

1849
02:12:32,201 --> 02:12:34,495
Don't let her get away!

1850
02:13:21,709 --> 02:13:23,210
Elphie, where are you going?

1851
02:13:23,211 --> 02:13:25,295
Elphie, what are you doing?

1852
02:13:25,296 --> 02:13:27,089
Oh. Oh! No.

1853
02:13:27,798 --> 02:13:30,301
Elphaba, please. Come back.
Let's just have a word with them.

1854
02:13:31,260 --> 02:13:32,677
Elphie. Elphie.

1855
02:13:32,678 --> 02:13:33,845
What are you doing?

1856
02:13:35,431 --> 02:13:36,599
Too much.

1857
02:13:39,644 --> 02:13:40,644
Take it.

1858
02:13:42,605 --> 02:13:44,649
Elphie! Oh! No...

1859
02:13:59,622 --> 02:14:04,042
Guards. Guards. Guards.

1860
02:14:04,043 --> 02:14:08,338
There's a fugitive at large
here in the palace.

1861
02:14:08,339 --> 02:14:11,843
Bring her to me.

1862
02:14:17,098 --> 02:14:18,099
Let's go.

1863
02:14:18,975 --> 02:14:21,268
- Elphaba, what are you doing?
- Just follow me. Follow me.

1864
02:14:21,269 --> 02:14:23,937
Where? What? Are you out of your mind?

1865
02:14:23,938 --> 02:14:25,689
Goodness, Elphaba,
you're being ridiculous.

1866
02:14:25,690 --> 02:14:27,942
- Just come on.
- Where are you going?

1867
02:14:28,818 --> 02:14:29,819
Up.

1868
02:14:33,322 --> 02:14:35,198
- They're in here!
- There she is! The green one.

1869
02:14:37,076 --> 02:14:39,161
- Get in quickly.
- Absolutely rid...

1870
02:14:41,914 --> 02:14:43,373
Quick. Jump.

1871
02:14:43,374 --> 02:14:45,167
Jump? Me, jump?

1872
02:14:45,168 --> 02:14:47,961
Quick. Jump, Glinda. Jump now!

1873
02:14:47,962 --> 02:14:50,255
Slipping...

1874
02:14:50,256 --> 02:14:51,966
Just grab my hand. Come on!

1875
02:14:58,973 --> 02:15:00,975
Come on. Grab on!

1876
02:15:02,226 --> 02:15:03,853
Get off!

1877
02:15:04,437 --> 02:15:05,813
Give me my leg.

1878
02:15:06,689 --> 02:15:07,899
Give me my leg.

1879
02:15:10,943 --> 02:15:12,528
Everyone, wait!

1880
02:15:34,759 --> 02:15:36,343
- Move!
- Faster!

1881
02:15:36,344 --> 02:15:37,552
- Push!
- Help me with this!

1882
02:15:37,553 --> 02:15:38,971
Hey! No!

1883
02:15:44,977 --> 02:15:46,062
Oh, no, no.

1884
02:15:49,190 --> 02:15:50,525
Elphie, Elphie, Elphie.

1885
02:15:52,276 --> 02:15:53,736
Faster! Look out!

1886
02:16:03,996 --> 02:16:05,080
Quick! Get off.

1887
02:16:05,081 --> 02:16:06,541
Ow, ow!

1888
02:16:09,877 --> 02:16:11,378
Don't look back!

1889
02:16:11,379 --> 02:16:14,048
- Get out of the way! Move!
- Watch out!

1890
02:16:17,301 --> 02:16:20,762
This is not good.
This is not good. This is not good.

1891
02:16:20,763 --> 02:16:22,180
Elphie.

1892
02:16:22,181 --> 02:16:23,349
Elphie!

1893
02:16:23,933 --> 02:16:26,268
Calm down.
You have got to let him explain.

1894
02:16:26,269 --> 02:16:27,520
Over my dead body.

1895
02:16:28,229 --> 02:16:29,814
This is everything you've dreamed of.

1896
02:16:37,154 --> 02:16:40,365
Elphaba, this is so much bigger than us.

1897
02:16:40,366 --> 02:16:42,492
Why couldn't you have stayed calm
for once,

1898
02:16:42,493 --> 02:16:44,451
instead of flying off the handle?

1899

there is an enemy who must be found
