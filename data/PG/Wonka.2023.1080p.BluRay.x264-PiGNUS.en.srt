1
00:01:46,336 --> 00:01:48,297
Land ahoy!

2
00:01:57,931 --> 00:01:59,099
Au revoir, Chef.

3
00:02:21,747 --> 00:02:22,831
Good luck, Willy!

4
00:02:27,085 --> 00:02:28,086
Goodbye, Cook!

5
00:02:48,106 --> 00:02:49,566
- Restaurant map, sir?- Thank you.

6
00:03:02,996 --> 00:03:04,247
That's three sovereigns, mate.

7
00:03:07,501 --> 00:03:08,821
Break my pumpkin, you pay for it.

8
00:03:09,961 --> 00:03:10,961
- Five, six, seven...

9
00:03:21,431 --> 00:03:23,266
- Brush your coat, sir?- No, thank you.

10
00:03:23,350 --> 00:03:24,935
- Cologne?- No. Leave me alone.

11
00:03:36,738 --> 00:03:38,407
It's everything you said, Mamma.

12
00:04:07,227 --> 00:04:08,228
Yeah!

13
00:04:18,905 --> 00:04:20,449
No daydreaming.

14
00:04:50,604 --> 00:04:53,607
Could you spare a sovereignfor a place to sleep, love?

15
00:04:53,690 --> 00:04:54,691
Of course.

16
00:04:55,233 --> 00:04:57,360
Here. Take all you need.

17
00:04:57,986 --> 00:04:59,154
Thank you.

18
00:05:39,861 --> 00:05:40,946
Hmm.

19
00:05:42,155 --> 00:05:43,865
There we go.

20
00:05:43,949 --> 00:05:46,117
Time for a little nightcap.

21
00:05:52,624 --> 00:05:53,667
Mmm.

22
00:05:58,046 --> 00:05:59,172
Okay.

23
00:05:59,714 --> 00:06:02,342
Hello there. No, stop. Hey, shoo.

24
00:06:02,425 --> 00:06:04,010
- Go away, stop!

25
00:06:04,094 --> 00:06:05,470
Go away, shoo! Shoo!

26
00:06:05,554 --> 00:06:06,638
- Stop!

27
00:06:06,721 --> 00:06:07,764
- Sit.

28
00:06:08,807 --> 00:06:10,100
Sorry about Tiddles.

29
00:06:10,684 --> 00:06:14,104
Seems to have an unusualinterest in your legs.

30
00:06:14,187 --> 00:06:15,438
Must be these pants.

31
00:06:15,522 --> 00:06:17,691
I got them from a mailman in Minsk.

32
00:06:17,774 --> 00:06:19,067
That would be it.

33
00:06:19,150 --> 00:06:23,530
Tiddles would spend all daypursuing postal workers if he could.

34
00:06:23,613 --> 00:06:24,948
- Wouldn't you, boy?

35
00:06:27,158 --> 00:06:29,744
You're not planning onsleeping there, are you, son?

36
00:06:29,828 --> 00:06:31,413
Oh, it's just for a night.

37
00:06:31,496 --> 00:06:33,832
By this time tomorrow,I plan to have made my fortune.

38
00:06:33,915 --> 00:06:37,294
By this time tomorrow,you'll be frozen solid.

39
00:06:37,377 --> 00:06:39,504
Oh, don't be ridiculous.

40
00:06:39,588 --> 00:06:40,589
Ooh.

41
00:06:42,716 --> 00:06:44,718
Perhaps it is a little cold for camping.

42
00:06:44,801 --> 00:06:47,429
But unfortunately, I'm notin a position to pay for a room, sir.

43
00:06:48,138 --> 00:06:51,224
- Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.- Mmm.

44
00:06:51,308 --> 00:06:53,143
But as luck would have it,

45
00:06:53,226 --> 00:06:56,062
I know someone who mightbe able to help you out.

46
00:06:56,771 --> 00:06:57,772
Really?

47
00:06:58,189 --> 00:06:59,900
- Here we are, Mr. Wonka.

48
00:06:59,983 --> 00:07:01,109
Home sweet home.

49
00:07:03,361 --> 00:07:06,156
Get your filthy pawsoff my front door, you mangy mutt.

50
00:07:07,574 --> 00:07:09,910
If that's you, Bleacher,you'd better have my gin.

51
00:07:09,993 --> 00:07:12,579
Oh, I have something betterthan gin, Mrs. Scrubitt.

52
00:07:13,705 --> 00:07:15,332
A guest.

53
00:07:16,166 --> 00:07:17,167
Hmm.

54
00:07:17,250 --> 00:07:18,376
Oh!

55
00:07:18,460 --> 00:07:20,170
Well, why didn't you say?

56
00:07:20,837 --> 00:07:23,173
- Come on in, sir.

57
00:07:23,256 --> 00:07:26,301
Welcome to Scrubitt and Bleacher'sGuest House and Laundry.

58
00:07:26,384 --> 00:07:29,512
Make yourself at home,warm your cockles by the fire.

59
00:07:29,596 --> 00:07:30,597
- Gin?- Oh.

60
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:31,723
Noodle!

61
00:07:31,806 --> 00:07:32,807
Yes, Mrs. Scrubitt?

62
00:07:32,891 --> 00:07:34,976
Put that book downand get our guest a glass o' gin.

63
00:07:35,518 --> 00:07:37,145
Poor man's frozen half to death.

64
00:07:37,228 --> 00:07:38,605
Thank you, Mrs. Scrubitt.

65
00:07:38,688 --> 00:07:40,378
You and your husbandhave been so kind to me.

66
00:07:40,398 --> 00:07:41,524
Husband?

67
00:07:41,608 --> 00:07:42,901
Him?

68
00:07:42,984 --> 00:07:43,985
Husband.

69
00:07:44,069 --> 00:07:45,389
Oh, you'd love that, wouldn't ya?

70
00:07:45,487 --> 00:07:46,488
No.

71
00:07:46,571 --> 00:07:50,450
Oh, I'm holding out for someonefar superior to that idle peasant.

72
00:07:50,533 --> 00:07:52,243
- Chin-chin.

73
00:07:54,454 --> 00:07:57,540
That is extremely strong stuff.

74
00:07:57,624 --> 00:07:58,917
Yeah, you can run cars on that.

75
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,211
So, what is itI can do for you? Room, is it?

76
00:08:01,795 --> 00:08:03,588
Well, yes, but, uh...

77
00:08:04,047 --> 00:08:08,093
Mr. Wonka is temporarily embarrassed.

78
00:08:08,176 --> 00:08:10,220
Oh, no. You don't say.

79
00:08:10,303 --> 00:08:11,785
I'm afraid that's true, Mrs. Scrubitt.

80
00:08:11,805 --> 00:08:13,056
But...

81
00:08:13,139 --> 00:08:15,141
- All that's about to change.- Oh, yeah?

82
00:08:15,225 --> 00:08:19,020
You see, I'm something of a magician,inventor and chocolate maker.

83
00:08:19,104 --> 00:08:21,439
And first thing tomorrowat the Galeries Gourmet,

84
00:08:21,523 --> 00:08:24,359
I plan to unveilmy most astonishing creation yet.

85
00:08:24,442 --> 00:08:25,276
Oh?

86
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:28,238
Prepare to be amazedas I present to you...

87
00:08:30,156 --> 00:08:31,157
A teapot?

88
00:08:31,241 --> 00:08:32,867
No, that's just for making tea.

89
00:08:32,951 --> 00:08:34,744
- One second.

90
00:08:36,621 --> 00:08:38,289
- That's for my stew.

91
00:08:39,165 --> 00:08:40,500
It's in here somewhere.

92
00:08:40,583 --> 00:08:41,668
Don't you worry, Mr. Wonka.

93
00:08:41,751 --> 00:08:43,628
I can see you're a manof great ingenuity.

94
00:08:43,712 --> 00:08:47,257
And we've got just the thing for ya.The entrepreneurial package.

95
00:08:47,340 --> 00:08:48,738
Now, the room is one sovereign a night,

96
00:08:48,758 --> 00:08:50,677
<i>but you don't have 10 paytill 600 tomorrow.</i>

97
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:52,840
Does that give you enough timeto earn a few pennies?

98
00:08:53,054 --> 00:08:54,639
More than enough, Mrs. Scrubitt.

99
00:08:54,723 --> 00:08:55,724
Thank you.

100
00:08:55,807 --> 00:08:58,560
Oh, it's the least I can dofor a stranger in need.

101
00:08:58,643 --> 00:09:01,062
Now, sign here and we're all done.

102
00:09:01,730 --> 00:09:04,024
- All righty.

103
00:09:06,401 --> 00:09:08,194
Read the small print.

104
00:09:08,278 --> 00:09:09,946
What?

105
00:09:10,030 --> 00:09:11,489
- Thank you, Noodle. That'll do.

106
00:09:12,407 --> 00:09:13,950
Ooh. What'd she say?

107
00:09:14,034 --> 00:09:15,243
- Who's that, then?- The girl.

108
00:09:15,326 --> 00:09:16,244
- What girl?- That girl.

109
00:09:16,327 --> 00:09:19,539
It sounded like,"Read the small print."

110
00:09:19,622 --> 00:09:21,750
And there does seem to be a lot of...

111
00:09:21,833 --> 00:09:24,210
Oh, oh, oh.

112
00:09:24,294 --> 00:09:27,005
- Oh, oh.

113
00:09:27,088 --> 00:09:29,507
Oh. Just keeps on coming.

114
00:09:29,591 --> 00:09:31,551
Yeah, you don't wanna listento Noodle, Mr. Wonka.

115
00:09:31,634 --> 00:09:33,386
- She's damaged.- Damaged?

116
00:09:33,762 --> 00:09:34,804
Orphan Syndrome.

117
00:09:34,888 --> 00:09:35,972
Orphan Syndrome?

118
00:09:36,306 --> 00:09:37,307
Orphan Syndrome.

119
00:09:37,390 --> 00:09:38,975
Orphan Syndrome.

120
00:09:39,059 --> 00:09:41,019
She was dropped downthe laundry chute as a bab,

121
00:09:41,102 --> 00:09:43,063
and I took her inout the goodness of my heart,

122
00:09:43,146 --> 00:09:45,356
and I've done my best,Mr. Wonka, honest I have,

123
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:47,650
but she's been leftwith a suspicious nature.

124
00:09:47,734 --> 00:09:50,153
She sees conspiracy everywhere.

125
00:09:50,236 --> 00:09:52,322
- Poor girl.- I know.

126
00:09:52,572 --> 00:09:54,574
These are just your standard Ts and Cs,

127
00:09:54,657 --> 00:09:56,457
but you're welcometo take a look if you want.

128
00:09:58,244 --> 00:09:59,444
I'll just give it a once-over.

129
00:10:08,129 --> 00:10:09,881
Well, that all seems to be in order.

130
00:10:09,964 --> 00:10:11,841
- Really?- Uh-huh.

131
00:10:11,925 --> 00:10:13,593
- Hello.- Ah!

132
00:10:13,676 --> 00:10:14,803
Then welcome to Scrubitt's.

133
00:10:17,722 --> 00:10:20,683
There you are, Mr. Wonka.The entrepreneurial suite.

134
00:10:20,767 --> 00:10:23,561
There's your four-poster,and your sink plus soap,

135
00:10:23,645 --> 00:10:24,918
and there's a little minton your pillow.

136
00:10:24,938 --> 00:10:25,939
Fantastic.

137
00:10:26,481 --> 00:10:27,899
What kind people.

138
00:10:36,324 --> 00:10:37,450
Noodle!

139
00:10:38,993 --> 00:10:40,745
Oh, Noodle!

140
00:10:40,829 --> 00:10:42,080
Yes, Mrs. Scrubitt?

141
00:10:42,163 --> 00:10:43,456
I've been lookin' for you.

142
00:10:43,540 --> 00:10:44,582
What do you want?

143
00:10:44,666 --> 00:10:46,606
I wanna teach you a lesson,you miserable little bookworm.

144
00:10:46,626 --> 00:10:47,627
What did I do wrong?

145
00:10:47,710 --> 00:10:49,129
You know what you did, you brat.

146
00:10:49,212 --> 00:10:50,652
- Stop squirming!- What? No, please.

147
00:10:52,132 --> 00:10:54,384
You ever interfere in my business again,

148
00:10:54,467 --> 00:10:56,886
and you'll be in this coop all week.Do you understand?

149
00:10:56,970 --> 00:10:59,556
Yes, Mrs. Scrubitt.Sorry, Mrs. Scrubitt.

150
00:11:00,098 --> 00:11:02,851
- I should think so too.

151
00:11:31,337 --> 00:11:33,214
Here we go, Mamma.

152
00:11:40,221 --> 00:11:43,308
Ladies and gentlemenof the Galeries Gourmet,

153
00:11:43,641 --> 00:11:45,560
my name is Willy Wonka,

154
00:11:45,643 --> 00:11:48,229
and I have come to show youa marvelous morsel,

155
00:11:48,313 --> 00:11:50,231
an incredible edible...

156
00:11:50,315 --> 00:11:53,026
an unbeatable eatable,

157
00:11:53,109 --> 00:11:54,869
the likes of whichthis world has never seen.

158
00:11:55,069 --> 00:11:57,155
So quiet up and listen down.

159
00:11:57,614 --> 00:11:59,324
No, scratch that, reverse it.

160
00:11:59,741 --> 00:12:00,783
I give to you

161
00:12:01,451 --> 00:12:02,577
the Hoverchoc.

162
00:13:16,276 --> 00:13:17,443
Bravo!

163
00:13:17,860 --> 00:13:19,654
- Bravo!

164
00:13:21,072 --> 00:13:22,407
Thank you.

165
00:13:22,490 --> 00:13:24,659
- Miss Bon-Bon?- Yes, Mr. Slugworth.

166
00:13:24,742 --> 00:13:25,910
Call the police.

167
00:13:25,994 --> 00:13:27,620
Very good, sir.

168
00:13:28,913 --> 00:13:30,081
Well, who wants to try one?

169
00:13:30,164 --> 00:13:31,958
- Me, please!- I will.

170
00:13:33,626 --> 00:13:35,628
- Mr. Slugworth, sir.- 'Scuse me.

171
00:13:35,712 --> 00:13:36,921
Mr. Fickelgruber.

172
00:13:37,005 --> 00:13:38,965
- And Mr. Prodnose.

173
00:13:39,048 --> 00:13:40,049
What an honor.

174
00:13:40,133 --> 00:13:41,634
Ever since I was a little boy...

175
00:13:41,718 --> 00:13:43,803
- That is quite a handshake.

176
00:13:43,886 --> 00:13:46,097
It's a business handshake, Mr. Wonka.

177
00:13:46,180 --> 00:13:48,141
Lets people know I mean business.

178
00:13:48,891 --> 00:13:49,976
- Huh...- Now, come along.

179
00:13:50,351 --> 00:13:54,188
Let's try one of theseso-called Hoverchocs.

180
00:14:03,740 --> 00:14:04,741
Ooh.

181
00:14:05,825 --> 00:14:07,368
It's not just chocolate, is it?

182
00:14:07,702 --> 00:14:08,702
There's...

183
00:14:09,746 --> 00:14:11,289
- Marshmallow.- That's right.

184
00:14:11,372 --> 00:14:13,499
Harvested fromthe mallow marshes of Peru.

185
00:14:13,583 --> 00:14:15,084
And caramel.

186
00:14:15,835 --> 00:14:16,836
But... But it's...

187
00:14:16,919 --> 00:14:17,962
Salted.

188
00:14:18,046 --> 00:14:20,840
With the bittersweet tearsof a Russian clown.

189
00:14:20,923 --> 00:14:22,717
- And is that...

190
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:23,843
Surely not?

191
00:14:24,385 --> 00:14:25,595
Cherry?

192
00:14:25,678 --> 00:14:27,493
Cherry-picked bythe pick of the cherry pickers

193
00:14:27,513 --> 00:14:29,349
from the Imperial Gardens in Japan.

194
00:14:29,432 --> 00:14:32,393
- Well, Mr. Wonka.

195
00:14:32,935 --> 00:14:34,655
I've been in this businessa very long time,

196
00:14:34,937 --> 00:14:36,397
and I can safely say

197
00:14:36,481 --> 00:14:38,941
that of all the chocolateI have ever tasted,

198
00:14:39,192 --> 00:14:40,985
this is without doubt

199
00:14:41,069 --> 00:14:44,322
the absolute 100% worst.

200
00:14:44,405 --> 00:14:45,490
- Whoo!

201
00:14:45,573 --> 00:14:46,888
There we have it, ladies and gentlemen.

202
00:14:46,908 --> 00:14:48,743
An endorsement from Mr...

203
00:14:48,826 --> 00:14:50,161
Wait. The worst?

204
00:14:50,244 --> 00:14:54,707
We three are the fiercest of rivals,and yet we agree on one thing.

205
00:14:54,791 --> 00:14:56,793
A good chocolate should be simple.

206
00:14:56,876 --> 00:14:58,920
Plain, uncomplicated.

207
00:14:59,003 --> 00:15:02,048
Whereas this,with all its bells and whistles...

208
00:15:02,131 --> 00:15:03,925
Well, it's just...

209
00:15:04,300 --> 00:15:05,301
Weird.

210
00:15:06,386 --> 00:15:08,012
That's a shame.

211
00:15:09,180 --> 00:15:12,725
If you thought the chocolate was weird,you're gonna hate what happens next.

212
00:15:13,768 --> 00:15:15,186
- Hmm?

213
00:15:15,728 --> 00:15:17,730
What's happening? Whoa, what's going on?

214
00:15:17,814 --> 00:15:19,399
- That's the hoverfly.

215
00:15:19,482 --> 00:15:20,858
It's broken out of its cocoon.

216
00:15:20,942 --> 00:15:22,944
It's flapping its wings like billy-oh.

217
00:15:24,237 --> 00:15:26,823
My hair!You mean a fly is doing this?

218
00:15:26,906 --> 00:15:28,116
Yes. But don't worry.

219
00:15:28,199 --> 00:15:30,326
- It'll be completely unharmed.- Oh, thank you.

220
00:15:30,410 --> 00:15:33,287
In about 20 minutes, it'll get tiredand exit through your rear.

221
00:15:33,746 --> 00:15:34,747
You what?

222
00:15:34,831 --> 00:15:36,911
He means we're goingto fart them out of our botties!

223
00:15:36,958 --> 00:15:38,668
Yes, I know what he meant.

224
00:15:38,751 --> 00:15:40,044
You're off your rocker, Wonka!

225
00:15:40,128 --> 00:15:43,047
Who in their right mindwants a chocolate that makes you fly?

226
00:15:43,131 --> 00:15:44,382
Well, let's find out, shall we?

227
00:15:44,465 --> 00:15:46,259
Who's for a Hoverchoc?

228
00:15:46,342 --> 00:15:48,511
- I want one!

229
00:15:48,594 --> 00:15:50,763
One sovereign, please. Thank you.

230
00:15:50,847 --> 00:15:52,682
- Thank you very much.

231
00:15:52,765 --> 00:15:54,600
One sovereign. Thank you, madam.

232
00:15:54,684 --> 00:15:55,685
- Enjoy your flight.

233
00:15:57,103 --> 00:15:59,397
Look, I'm flying! I'm flying!

234
00:16:02,483 --> 00:16:03,651
How's the view up there?

235
00:16:04,777 --> 00:16:06,362
Not too high, darling!

236
00:16:10,199 --> 00:16:11,534
Beat it, kid.

237
00:16:11,617 --> 00:16:14,078
All right, folks. Nothin' to see here.

238
00:16:14,162 --> 00:16:17,748
Just a small group of peopledef yin' the laws of gravity.

239
00:16:17,832 --> 00:16:19,250
- Yeah.- Hook 'em, boys.

240
00:16:19,333 --> 00:16:21,335
That's the Hoverchoc, sir.That's the point.

241
00:16:21,419 --> 00:16:23,671
I'm afraid we've hadsome complaints about you, sir.

242
00:16:23,754 --> 00:16:24,755
Complaints?

243
00:16:24,839 --> 00:16:27,049
That you're disruptingthe trade of other businesses.

244
00:16:27,133 --> 00:16:31,387
I'm regrettably obliged to move you onand to confiscate your earnings.

245
00:16:32,388 --> 00:16:33,639
- Hey! What are you doing?- No!

246
00:16:33,723 --> 00:16:35,349
Don't worry, it's going to a good cause.

247
00:16:35,433 --> 00:16:37,393
- Get off.- Sick kids, or something.

248
00:16:37,477 --> 00:16:39,395
Sorry, sir. Rules is rules.

249
00:16:39,479 --> 00:16:40,938
Cheeky devil, you! Come here!

250
00:16:41,022 --> 00:16:42,648
Could you at least leave me a sovereign?

251
00:16:43,733 --> 00:16:45,151
I need to pay for my room.

252
00:16:48,362 --> 00:16:50,656
- Here.

253
00:16:51,908 --> 00:16:52,909
Thank you.

254
00:16:56,829 --> 00:16:58,122
Evening, Mr. Wonka.

255
00:16:59,081 --> 00:17:00,082
How'd it go?

256
00:17:00,458 --> 00:17:01,918
Not quite as well as I'd hoped.

257
00:17:02,001 --> 00:17:05,254
Oh, shame. Well, I'm afraidwe do have to settle up now.

258
00:17:05,338 --> 00:17:07,131
Well, thankfullythe room's taken care of.

259
00:17:08,090 --> 00:17:09,592
Believe we said a sovereign.

260
00:17:09,675 --> 00:17:10,885
For the room, yes.

261
00:17:10,968 --> 00:17:14,013
But you have incurred a few extras

262
00:17:14,096 --> 00:17:16,557
during the courseof your residency with ourselves.

263
00:17:17,183 --> 00:17:19,810
- Have 1?- Yes, you have.

264
00:17:20,728 --> 00:17:23,356
There was that glass of ginyou had on arrival,

265
00:17:23,773 --> 00:17:27,318
and if I remember rightly,you warmed your cockles by the fire.

266
00:17:27,401 --> 00:17:29,111
He did indeed, Mrs. Scrubitt.

267
00:17:29,195 --> 00:17:31,489
- Cockle-warming is extra, see?

268
00:17:31,572 --> 00:17:34,116
Used the stairsto get to his room, and all.

269
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:35,785
Oh, then you've got your stair charge,

270
00:17:35,868 --> 00:17:38,579
and that is per step,I'm afraid, up and down.

271
00:17:38,663 --> 00:17:40,206
Now, tell me, Mr. Wonka,

272
00:17:40,289 --> 00:17:42,542
did you happen to use the mini bar?

273
00:17:42,625 --> 00:17:43,709
There's a minibar?

274
00:17:43,793 --> 00:17:44,877
Mini bar of soap.

275
00:17:44,961 --> 00:17:45,962
By the sink.

276
00:17:46,045 --> 00:17:48,548
- Uh... I might have, briefly.- Oh-ho!

277
00:17:48,631 --> 00:17:50,758
See? Even Bleacher knowsyou never touch the mini bar,

278
00:17:50,841 --> 00:17:52,260
and he was raised in a ditch.

279
00:17:52,802 --> 00:17:54,554
Add in your mattress hire,

280
00:17:54,637 --> 00:17:56,681
your linen lease,and your pillow penalty,

281
00:17:56,764 --> 00:17:58,307
- and you are looking at...

282
00:17:58,391 --> 00:18:00,101
Ten thousand sovereigns.

283
00:18:00,184 --> 00:18:01,227
You gotta be kidding me.

284
00:18:01,310 --> 00:18:03,229
It's all in the small print, dearie.

285
00:18:04,021 --> 00:18:05,398
I don't have 10,000 sovereigns.

286
00:18:06,566 --> 00:18:08,484
Then we have a problem, Mr. Wonka.

287
00:18:08,568 --> 00:18:10,968
You're gonna have to work it offin the Wash House, ain't ya?

288
00:18:11,654 --> 00:18:12,947
At a sovereign a day.

289
00:18:13,030 --> 00:18:14,240
Ten thousand days is...

290
00:18:14,323 --> 00:18:15,408
Twenty-seven years.

291
00:18:15,491 --> 00:18:16,492
- Hey!- Four months.

292
00:18:16,576 --> 00:18:17,618
And 16 days.

293
00:18:23,833 --> 00:18:25,585
- Ah.

294
00:18:26,294 --> 00:18:28,838
- You must be Mr. Wonka.- Who are you?

295
00:18:28,921 --> 00:18:32,091
Abacus Crunch, chartered accountant.

296
00:18:32,174 --> 00:18:33,718
At least I was.

297
00:18:33,801 --> 00:18:35,845
- Now, uh...- He runs the place.

298
00:18:35,928 --> 00:18:38,014
And you best do as he says,or you'll answer to me.

299
00:18:38,097 --> 00:18:40,224
Piper Benz. Plumber by trade.

300
00:18:40,308 --> 00:18:42,268
This is Miss Lottie Bell.

301
00:18:42,351 --> 00:18:43,352
Hi.

302
00:18:43,894 --> 00:18:44,979
She don't talk much.

303
00:18:45,062 --> 00:18:48,983
And I'm Larry Chucklesworth!

304
00:18:49,066 --> 00:18:50,067
Comedian.

305
00:18:50,151 --> 00:18:51,277
Hmm.

306
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:52,945
So they got all of you too, did they?

307
00:18:53,029 --> 00:18:54,280
I'm afraid so.

308
00:18:54,363 --> 00:18:57,158
We each of us found ourselvesin need of a cheap place to stay

309
00:18:57,241 --> 00:18:59,994
and neglected to read the small print.

310
00:19:00,077 --> 00:19:03,998
One moment of stupidity,followed by endless regret.

311
00:19:04,081 --> 00:19:06,751
Sounds like my third marriage.

312
00:19:07,835 --> 00:19:09,337
I'm sorry, I do that a lot.

313
00:19:09,420 --> 00:19:10,880
- He does.- A lot.

314
00:19:10,963 --> 00:19:14,091
I've only been married once,and it didn't work out.

315
00:19:14,175 --> 00:19:15,573
There's gotta be some way outta here.

316
00:19:15,593 --> 00:19:16,719
You don't think we've tried?

317
00:19:17,136 --> 00:19:19,410
There are bars on the windowand there's a dog on the door.

318
00:19:19,430 --> 00:19:22,683
And even if you could get out,that contract is watertight.

319
00:19:22,767 --> 00:19:24,101
If you're not here at roll call,

320
00:19:24,185 --> 00:19:26,500
Mrs. Scrubitt will call the police,they'll bring you right back,

321
00:19:26,520 --> 00:19:28,680
and she'll charge youa thousand for the inconvenience.

322
00:19:29,815 --> 00:19:30,963
All right, everybody. Back to work.

323
00:19:30,983 --> 00:19:32,276
- Come along, Mr. Wonka.

324
00:19:32,360 --> 00:19:34,695
- You come with me.

325
00:19:35,488 --> 00:19:37,990
You're in here. On suds.

326
00:19:44,246 --> 00:19:45,247
Whoa.

327
00:20:15,695 --> 00:20:17,571
It's still long, though.

328
00:20:50,730 --> 00:20:52,898
And if you don't agree...

329
00:20:52,982 --> 00:20:54,567
See clause five.

330
00:20:54,650 --> 00:20:55,943
Section 7A.

331
00:20:56,026 --> 00:20:57,486
Paragraph 22.

332
00:20:57,570 --> 00:20:58,863
Part D.

333
00:20:58,946 --> 00:21:00,030
Which says...

334
00:21:40,362 --> 00:21:42,323
- Room service.

335
00:21:43,365 --> 00:21:45,034
Told you to read the small print.

336
00:21:46,410 --> 00:21:47,953
Slight problem with that.

337
00:21:49,246 --> 00:21:51,165
You can't read, can you?

338
00:21:51,999 --> 00:21:54,877
I focused my studiesalmost exclusively on chocolate.

339
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:55,961
I see.

340
00:21:57,296 --> 00:21:58,297
For everything else,

341
00:21:58,380 --> 00:22:00,090
I've reliedon the kindness of strangers.

342
00:22:00,174 --> 00:22:02,092
And look where that's got you.

343
00:22:02,176 --> 00:22:03,928
The staff quarters.

344
00:22:04,011 --> 00:22:05,596
You've got a bed.

345
00:22:07,848 --> 00:22:09,475
You had a bed.

346
00:22:10,100 --> 00:22:13,854
Desk, and a wash basin/toilet.

347
00:22:13,938 --> 00:22:14,814
Ugh.

348
00:22:14,897 --> 00:22:16,690
- The water comes in two temperatures.

349
00:22:16,774 --> 00:22:19,652
Cold... and colder.

350
00:22:21,195 --> 00:22:22,363
How much do you owe them?

351
00:22:22,905 --> 00:22:23,948
Ten thousand.

352
00:22:24,490 --> 00:22:26,909
Count yourself lucky. I owe 30.

353
00:22:26,992 --> 00:22:29,036
What? How do you owe them money?

354
00:22:29,119 --> 00:22:31,080
I thought they found youdown a laundry chute.

355
00:22:31,163 --> 00:22:32,164
Oh, they did.

356
00:22:32,248 --> 00:22:34,250
Took me in out ofthe goodness of their hearts

357
00:22:34,333 --> 00:22:36,210
and charged me for the privilege.

358
00:22:36,293 --> 00:22:38,254
What a pair of monsters.

359
00:22:38,712 --> 00:22:41,507
The greedy beat the needyevery time, Mr. Wonka.

360
00:22:41,590 --> 00:22:43,217
Guess it's just the way of the world.

361
00:22:43,300 --> 00:22:44,301
Oh, come on, Noodle.

362
00:22:44,802 --> 00:22:46,846
That's just yourOrphan Syndrome talking.

363
00:22:48,097 --> 00:22:50,224
- My what?- Your Orphan Syndrome.

364
00:22:50,307 --> 00:22:52,893
And we are not gonnabe eating any slops.

365
00:22:53,561 --> 00:22:54,603
What are you doing?

366
00:22:55,396 --> 00:22:56,814
I'm making chocolate, o' course.

367
00:22:56,897 --> 00:22:58,107
How do you like it? Dark?

368
00:22:58,190 --> 00:23:00,401
White? Nutty? Absolutely insane?

369
00:23:00,860 --> 00:23:02,152
I don't know.

370
00:23:02,236 --> 00:23:04,071
I've never had any.

371
00:23:05,322 --> 00:23:07,491
You've never had chocolate?

372
00:23:07,950 --> 00:23:09,451
- No.- What?

373
00:23:09,535 --> 00:23:10,911
You've never had chocolate?

374
00:23:11,620 --> 00:23:12,746
Still no.

375
00:23:13,622 --> 00:23:15,782
Well, this is unbelievable.I mean, this is outrageous.

376
00:23:16,250 --> 00:23:17,898
Well, lucky for you, Noodle,I have a selection

377
00:23:17,918 --> 00:23:21,463
of the world's finest ingredientsright here in my travel factory.

378
00:23:26,719 --> 00:23:27,720
Whoa.

379
00:23:27,803 --> 00:23:29,763
Where to begin? That's the question.

380
00:23:29,847 --> 00:23:30,848
I know!

381
00:23:31,348 --> 00:23:32,516
Silver Linings.

382
00:23:32,600 --> 00:23:34,685
Made of condensed thunder clouds

383
00:23:35,394 --> 00:23:36,979
and liquid sunlight.

384
00:23:38,188 --> 00:23:40,190
Helps you see that faint ray o' hope

385
00:23:40,274 --> 00:23:42,151
beyond the shadow of despair.

386
00:23:42,234 --> 00:23:43,777
Just what we need, wouldn't you say?

387
00:23:45,070 --> 00:23:46,614
Did you always wanna make chocolate?

388
00:23:46,697 --> 00:23:48,574
No.

389
00:23:48,657 --> 00:23:52,036
Back when I was your age,I wanted to be a magician.

390
00:23:52,119 --> 00:23:53,454
My mom was a cook.

391
00:23:54,705 --> 00:23:56,999
We lived on the river,just the two of us.

392
00:23:57,416 --> 00:24:00,169
In a perfect little world of our own.

393
00:24:02,463 --> 00:24:05,591
The way I remember I,I used to spend every waking hour

394
00:24:05,674 --> 00:24:08,552
trying to come up with somenew trick to impress my mom.

395
00:24:09,428 --> 00:24:11,013
Bravo!

396
00:24:12,014 --> 00:24:14,391
But the real magic came from her.

397
00:24:16,769 --> 00:24:19,271
We didn't have a lotta money,but each week,

398
00:24:19,355 --> 00:24:21,357
she brought home one cocoa bean.

399
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:23,233
And by the time my birthday came around,

400
00:24:23,317 --> 00:24:25,694
there was enough to makea single bar o' chocolate.

401
00:24:27,112 --> 00:24:28,989
But it wasn't just any old chocolate.

402
00:24:29,782 --> 00:24:30,866
Far from it.

403
00:24:32,451 --> 00:24:35,120
This has to bethe best chocolate in the world.

404
00:24:35,204 --> 00:24:36,664
Oh, don't know about that.

405
00:24:36,747 --> 00:24:39,041
They say the very bestcomes from a place

406
00:24:39,124 --> 00:24:40,417
called the Galeries Gourmet.

407
00:24:41,251 --> 00:24:43,462
Theirs can't be any betterthan yours, Mamma.

408
00:24:43,921 --> 00:24:45,381
It's impossible.

409
00:24:45,464 --> 00:24:48,258
Well, as it so happens,

410
00:24:48,342 --> 00:24:52,888
I do know a little secretthat even those fancy-pants don't.

411
00:24:53,931 --> 00:24:54,932
What is it?

412
00:24:55,015 --> 00:24:56,350
I'll tell ya.

413
00:24:56,684 --> 00:24:59,395
When you're older.Now get to sleep.

414
00:25:05,985 --> 00:25:07,444
We should go, Amma.

415
00:25:07,528 --> 00:25:08,612
Where's that, then?

416
00:25:09,154 --> 00:25:11,198
- To the Galeries Gourmet.- What?

417
00:25:11,281 --> 00:25:13,200
- And start a shop?- Yeah.

418
00:25:13,283 --> 00:25:15,369
With our nameabove the door and everything.

419
00:25:15,828 --> 00:25:17,955
That's a wonderful dream, honey.

420
00:25:18,789 --> 00:25:20,082
Is that all it is?

421
00:25:21,834 --> 00:25:23,377
Just a dream?

422
00:25:24,878 --> 00:25:26,005
Hey now.

423
00:25:29,133 --> 00:25:32,720
Every good thing in this worldstarted with a dream.

424
00:25:33,303 --> 00:25:34,763
So you hold on to yours.

425
00:25:35,556 --> 00:25:37,850
And when you do sharechocolate with the world,

426
00:25:37,933 --> 00:25:40,978
oh, I'll be right there beside ya.

427
00:25:41,061 --> 00:25:42,354
Promise?

428
00:25:42,438 --> 00:25:43,605
Do better than that.

429
00:25:43,689 --> 00:25:46,066
I pinkie promise.

430
00:25:48,152 --> 00:25:49,403
Now,

431
00:25:49,486 --> 00:25:50,654
sleep.

432
00:25:53,574 --> 00:25:55,951
So, what was it, Willy?

433
00:25:56,869 --> 00:25:57,995
What was the secret?

434
00:25:58,996 --> 00:26:00,414
I never found out.

435
00:26:02,041 --> 00:26:03,208
Soon after, she fell sick.

436
00:26:05,085 --> 00:26:08,255
And before I knew itall I had left was her bar of chocolate.

437
00:26:13,093 --> 00:26:14,553
That's why I'm here, Noodle.

438
00:26:15,179 --> 00:26:17,431
So I can feel the same wayI did back then,

439
00:26:18,390 --> 00:26:20,142
eating chocolate with her.

440
00:26:21,727 --> 00:26:22,727
What do you mean?

441
00:26:23,187 --> 00:26:24,229
My mom once promised

442
00:26:24,313 --> 00:26:26,023
that when I sharechocolate with the world,

443
00:26:26,106 --> 00:26:27,900
she'd be right there beside me.

444
00:26:29,735 --> 00:26:31,987
I know it sounds crazy,but I always hoped

445
00:26:32,071 --> 00:26:33,363
she'd somehow keep that promise.

446
00:26:35,324 --> 00:26:37,409
She might even tell me her secret.

447
00:26:43,707 --> 00:26:45,250
Here. Try one.

448
00:27:03,811 --> 00:27:04,895
Wish you hadn't done that.

449
00:27:06,105 --> 00:27:07,106
You don't like it?

450
00:27:07,189 --> 00:27:08,190
No...

451
00:27:08,690 --> 00:27:11,193
I like it. It's just...

452
00:27:11,819 --> 00:27:12,945
What?

453
00:27:14,071 --> 00:27:17,366
Now each day I don't have chocolatewill be a little harder.

454
00:27:18,534 --> 00:27:20,349
Then how would you liketo have all the chocolate

455
00:27:20,369 --> 00:27:23,330
you can eat, every day,for the rest of your life?

456
00:27:23,705 --> 00:27:26,416
- A lifetime supply?- A lifetime supply.

457
00:27:27,251 --> 00:27:28,335
What would I have to do?

458
00:27:28,418 --> 00:27:30,087
Not much. Just get me out of here.

459
00:27:30,170 --> 00:27:32,089
- Are you crazy?- Shh!

460
00:27:32,172 --> 00:27:34,091
It's easy. I'll get someoneto cover my shift,

461
00:27:34,174 --> 00:27:35,697
and you could smuggle me outin your laundry cart.

462
00:27:35,717 --> 00:27:37,032
- But I...- Just for a few hours, mind.

463
00:27:37,052 --> 00:27:38,372
No one will even know I was gone.

464
00:27:38,929 --> 00:27:41,431
- What's the point of that?- To sell chocolate, o' course!

465
00:27:41,515 --> 00:27:43,705
We'll split the profitsand pay off Mrs. Scrubitt in no time.

466
00:27:43,725 --> 00:27:44,977
It's a nice idea, Willy.

467
00:27:45,060 --> 00:27:46,979
- It's a great idea.- But it'll never work.

468
00:27:47,062 --> 00:27:48,647
'Course it will. Eat your chocolate.

469
00:27:48,730 --> 00:27:49,815
You don't understand.

470
00:27:50,524 --> 00:27:51,900
Mrs. Scrubitt's like a hawk.

471
00:27:51,984 --> 00:27:53,464
She keeps her beady eye on everything

472
00:27:53,485 --> 00:27:55,779
that comes in and outof the Wash House except...

473
00:27:55,863 --> 00:27:57,823
- Huh.

474
00:27:58,532 --> 00:27:59,533
What is it?

475
00:28:00,284 --> 00:28:01,285
No, it's nothing.

476
00:28:01,702 --> 00:28:02,953
Oh, okay.

477
00:28:03,453 --> 00:28:04,329
Huh.

478
00:28:04,413 --> 00:28:06,248
Double-huh! That's not nothing.

479
00:28:06,331 --> 00:28:07,980
That's the Silver Lining.It's given you an idea.

480
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:09,000
Okay.

481
00:28:09,042 --> 00:28:10,524
So, the one time she dropped her guard

482
00:28:10,544 --> 00:28:12,379
was when this aristocratcame to the laundry.

483
00:28:12,754 --> 00:28:15,841
He was only asking for directions,but she was all over him like a rash.

484
00:28:16,466 --> 00:28:17,843
It was disgusting.

485
00:28:18,260 --> 00:28:19,261
That's it, Noodle.

486
00:28:19,344 --> 00:28:22,556
All we have to do is find an aristocratand slip out while she's distracted.

487
00:28:22,639 --> 00:28:23,640
Yeah, but...

488
00:28:24,433 --> 00:28:26,476
Where are we goingto find an aristocrat?

489
00:28:29,563 --> 00:28:30,564
Huh.

490
00:28:30,647 --> 00:28:31,648
Huh?

491
00:28:32,649 --> 00:28:33,692
Huh.

492
00:28:33,775 --> 00:28:34,902
A double-huh.

493
00:28:35,277 --> 00:28:36,341
Do you have a pencil and paper?

494
00:28:36,361 --> 00:28:38,697
- Uh-huh.- I got an idea.

495
00:28:58,800 --> 00:29:00,385
I've come to make a confession.

496
00:29:02,721 --> 00:29:05,140
You sound great, fellas. Keep it up.

497
00:29:10,145 --> 00:29:12,397
Forgive me, Father, for I have sinned.

498
00:29:14,399 --> 00:29:17,819
I have had 150 of thesesince my last confession.

499
00:29:20,614 --> 00:29:23,200
Temptation is very hard to resist.

500
00:29:26,620 --> 00:29:27,955
Mmm.

501
00:29:28,497 --> 00:29:29,873
Send me down.

502
00:29:31,208 --> 00:29:33,585
- I'll see you later.

503
00:29:38,799 --> 00:29:40,467
Good evening, Chief.

504
00:29:41,218 --> 00:29:42,427
They're all waiting.

505
00:29:42,511 --> 00:29:44,096
Thank you very much.

506
00:29:45,806 --> 00:29:48,558
Good evening, gentlemen.I've brought my invoice.

507
00:29:48,642 --> 00:29:51,937
One chocolatier moved onfor the usual fee.

508
00:29:52,521 --> 00:29:53,897
Oh.

509
00:29:53,981 --> 00:29:56,942
Here we go, baby.There's the good stuff. Yeah.

510
00:29:57,025 --> 00:29:58,944
- Tell me, Chief...- Mmm-hmm?

511
00:29:59,027 --> 00:30:00,968
...how would you liketo earn a few more of those?

512
00:30:00,988 --> 00:30:02,406
Oh, I am listening.

513
00:30:02,489 --> 00:30:04,157
We think that Mr. Wonka

514
00:30:04,241 --> 00:30:08,120
might require a little morethan simply moving on.

515
00:30:08,203 --> 00:30:09,621
- Oh.- He's good.

516
00:30:09,705 --> 00:30:10,831
Too good.

517
00:30:10,914 --> 00:30:14,418
And what's more, he only chargesa sovereign a chocolate.

518
00:30:14,543 --> 00:30:17,004
So anyone can afford them, even the...

519
00:30:19,047 --> 00:30:20,173
You know, the...

520
00:30:20,882 --> 00:30:23,427
- The poor?- Oh, dear.

521
00:30:23,510 --> 00:30:26,221
I've just beena little bit sick in my mouth.

522
00:30:26,305 --> 00:30:29,599
Could you please refrain from mentioningthat demographic in my presence?

523
00:30:29,683 --> 00:30:31,323
He doesn't like itwhen people say "poor."

524
00:30:31,393 --> 00:30:32,644
- Sorry, Felix.

525
00:30:33,228 --> 00:30:36,023
We want you to send Wonka a message.

526
00:30:36,106 --> 00:30:38,317
Backed up by physical force.

527
00:30:38,400 --> 00:30:40,944
That if he attempts to sellchocolate in this town again,

528
00:30:41,028 --> 00:30:44,364
he is liable to meetwith a little accident.

529
00:30:44,448 --> 00:30:46,658
In which he dies.

530
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:48,660
Yeah, no, I... I got that already.

531
00:30:48,744 --> 00:30:49,933
You don't have to keep saying it.

532
00:30:49,953 --> 00:30:51,913
I'm just making surewe're all on the same page.

533
00:30:51,997 --> 00:30:53,103
Well, no one's on your page.

534
00:30:53,123 --> 00:30:55,022
What's that supposed to mean?Well, I know what it means...

535
00:30:55,042 --> 00:30:56,106
Actually, what does it mean?

536
00:30:56,126 --> 00:30:57,377
Gentlemen, please.

537
00:30:59,004 --> 00:31:02,215
So, what do you say, Chief?Do we have a deal?

538
00:31:02,299 --> 00:31:05,218
Well, listen, fellas,I'm an officer of the law.

539
00:31:05,594 --> 00:31:08,388
I can't just go aroundroughin' up your competition.

540
00:31:09,473 --> 00:31:10,474
I'm sorry.

541
00:31:11,516 --> 00:31:12,516
Well now, Chief.

542
00:31:15,145 --> 00:31:17,356
I can see thatyou're a man of integrity.

543
00:31:19,524 --> 00:31:20,567
Thank you.

544
00:31:20,650 --> 00:31:22,819
But ask yourself this...

545
00:31:39,628 --> 00:31:40,629
Mmm.

546
00:31:56,395 --> 00:31:58,647
Promised the wifeI'd cut down on chocolate.

547
00:31:58,730 --> 00:32:00,023
Y'know, I gotta get in shape

548
00:32:00,107 --> 00:32:01,775
for the Policeman's Ball, so...

549
00:32:33,306 --> 00:32:34,349
No!

550
00:32:36,935 --> 00:32:38,770
Gentlemen, let's give it the big sell.

551
00:32:49,614 --> 00:32:51,074
I do, really. Yeah.

552
00:33:22,939 --> 00:33:23,982
- Bell.

553
00:33:24,065 --> 00:33:25,066
- Here.- Benz.

554
00:33:25,150 --> 00:33:26,193
- Mmm.

555
00:33:26,276 --> 00:33:27,277
- Chucklesworth.

556
00:33:27,360 --> 00:33:28,528
- Crunch.

557
00:33:28,612 --> 00:33:29,905
- Here.- Wonka.

558
00:33:29,988 --> 00:33:31,364
- Bleacher!

559
00:33:31,448 --> 00:33:33,742
- Toilet's blocked again.

560
00:33:33,825 --> 00:33:34,868
Oh, wow.

561
00:33:34,951 --> 00:33:36,828
The unmistakable sound of love.

562
00:33:37,579 --> 00:33:38,579
You what?

563
00:33:39,498 --> 00:33:40,874
Don't tell me you hadn't noticed.

564
00:33:41,124 --> 00:33:42,124
What?

565
00:33:42,167 --> 00:33:43,668
She's madly in love with you.

566
00:33:44,044 --> 00:33:45,504
Mrs. Scrubitt?

567
00:33:45,587 --> 00:33:46,796
Besotted.

568
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:48,548
And why not? Look at you.

569
00:33:48,924 --> 00:33:50,675
Fine figure of a man.

570
00:33:50,759 --> 00:33:52,599
You just need to tidyyourself up a little bit.

571
00:33:52,636 --> 00:33:53,762
Get some new clothes.

572
00:33:54,304 --> 00:33:55,472
Have a bath.

573
00:33:55,889 --> 00:33:57,140
A bath?

574
00:33:57,224 --> 00:33:59,142
You do know what they say, right?

575
00:34:00,602 --> 00:34:01,811
What do they say?

576
00:34:02,145 --> 00:34:03,647
She'll be thankful for an ankle.

577
00:34:03,730 --> 00:34:04,731
Yes.

578
00:34:04,814 --> 00:34:06,338
- And pleased to see your knees.- Right.

579
00:34:06,358 --> 00:34:08,777
- But if you wanna make her sigh...- Tell me.

580
00:34:09,152 --> 00:34:10,904
Show her some thigh.

581
00:34:12,781 --> 00:34:13,782
Bleacher!

582
00:34:13,865 --> 00:34:15,659
- It's overflowing now.

583
00:34:15,742 --> 00:34:17,410
- Get in there. Back to work.- All right.

584
00:34:17,494 --> 00:34:18,745
It's up to me ankles!

585
00:34:18,828 --> 00:34:20,288
- Time-waster.

586
00:34:20,664 --> 00:34:21,957
- Bleacher!

587
00:34:22,040 --> 00:34:24,251
Curse that idle peasant.

588
00:34:33,718 --> 00:34:34,970
- What you got there?

589
00:34:35,345 --> 00:34:36,345
Nothing.

590
00:34:37,305 --> 00:34:39,266
Do you like that coop, Noodle?

591
00:34:39,808 --> 00:34:40,809
All right.

592
00:34:41,351 --> 00:34:43,791
I was collecting laundryfrom Professor Monocle the other day.

593
00:34:43,853 --> 00:34:45,063
Yeah.

594
00:34:45,146 --> 00:34:47,087
He's writing a book aboutthe Bavarian Royal Family.

595
00:34:47,107 --> 00:34:48,108
Boring.

596
00:34:48,191 --> 00:34:50,318
He's got sketches of noblemenall over his wall.

597
00:34:50,402 --> 00:34:51,444
So?

598
00:34:51,528 --> 00:34:53,321
This one looked rather familiar.

599
00:34:55,282 --> 00:34:56,283
Oh.

600
00:34:56,533 --> 00:34:58,535
Blow me. That looks exactly like...

601
00:34:58,618 --> 00:35:00,078
Mr. Bleacher.

602
00:35:01,037 --> 00:35:04,249
Are you telling me Bleacheris a Bavarian aristocrat?

603
00:35:04,332 --> 00:35:05,332
- Uh-huh.

604
00:35:06,167 --> 00:35:07,377
Go and get my gin.

605
00:35:24,144 --> 00:35:25,145
Whoa!

606
00:35:39,075 --> 00:35:41,036
Oh, so you finally managedto drag your lazy...

607
00:35:46,416 --> 00:35:47,976
Have you done something with your hair?

608
00:35:48,585 --> 00:35:49,753
Maybe.

609
00:35:49,836 --> 00:35:51,212
Maybe not.

610
00:35:54,591 --> 00:35:56,176
Where'd you get them dungarees?

611
00:35:56,259 --> 00:35:57,927
- Lost property.

612
00:35:58,386 --> 00:35:59,387
Why?

613
00:36:00,472 --> 00:36:01,640
Do they suit me?

614
00:36:01,723 --> 00:36:03,558
- Yeah.

615
00:36:03,642 --> 00:36:05,435
Not bad, I suppose.

616
00:36:07,771 --> 00:36:09,439
What're you doingall the way over there?

617
00:36:09,522 --> 00:36:11,608
- Keeping my knees warm.

618
00:36:11,691 --> 00:36:14,361
Well, why don't you come over hereand have a glass o' gin?

619
00:36:15,070 --> 00:36:18,698
Why don't you come over here,where it's all hot?

620
00:36:18,782 --> 00:36:20,742
Whoa!

621
00:36:20,825 --> 00:36:22,744
Oh!

622
00:36:22,827 --> 00:36:24,746
- Oh, my Lord.

623
00:36:26,081 --> 00:36:27,395
Ladies and gentlemen,may I present to you

624
00:36:27,415 --> 00:36:29,501
a brand-new contraption of my creation,

625
00:36:29,584 --> 00:36:31,586
an innovation in laundrification.

626
00:36:32,754 --> 00:36:33,797
Let me ask you a question,

627
00:36:33,880 --> 00:36:35,520
how does Tiddleswanna spend all his time?

628
00:36:35,548 --> 00:36:36,758
- Chasing after mailmen.

629
00:36:36,841 --> 00:36:39,344
And what do I have to do all day,fellow scrubbers, please?

630
00:36:40,637 --> 00:36:42,410
But now, with Willy Wonka'sWild and Wonderful

631
00:36:42,430 --> 00:36:43,556
Wishy-washy Wonka Walker,

632
00:36:43,640 --> 00:36:44,996
please don't make me say that again,

633
00:36:45,016 --> 00:36:46,726
Tiddles gets to run and I can have fun.

634
00:36:48,103 --> 00:36:49,896
Just popping out for a bit.

635
00:36:49,979 --> 00:36:51,981
I'll be back before roll call.

636
00:36:52,065 --> 00:36:54,818
Until then, Tiddles has agreed to...

637
00:36:57,278 --> 00:37:00,365
So, tell me all about Bavaria.

638
00:37:00,448 --> 00:37:02,200
- Where?- Where you're from.

639
00:37:02,283 --> 00:37:04,619
- Oh, yes. It's very...

640
00:37:04,703 --> 00:37:06,871
- ...Bavarian.- Oh, whoo.

641
00:37:12,669 --> 00:37:13,795
All clear.

642
00:37:13,878 --> 00:37:14,879
- Really?- Yeah.

643
00:37:15,505 --> 00:37:17,507
We did it! Well done, Noodle.

644
00:37:17,590 --> 00:37:18,883
I can't believe it worked.

645
00:37:18,967 --> 00:37:21,127
Wait till you see how muchchocolate I made last night.

646
00:37:21,177 --> 00:37:22,971
We sell this, and we're gonna be...

647
00:37:24,222 --> 00:37:25,223
Oh, no.

648
00:37:25,807 --> 00:37:27,016
What's going on, Willy?

649
00:37:27,100 --> 00:37:28,184
Not again.

650
00:37:28,268 --> 00:37:29,561
Where are the chocolates?

651
00:37:29,644 --> 00:37:31,564
I don't knowhow to tell you this, Noodle, but...

652
00:37:32,188 --> 00:37:33,231
They've been stolen.

653
00:37:33,690 --> 00:37:34,941
- Stolen?- Mmm-hmm.

654
00:37:35,024 --> 00:37:36,067
Who by?

655
00:37:36,776 --> 00:37:38,611
The Little Orange Man.

656
00:37:39,028 --> 00:37:40,029
What?

657
00:37:40,113 --> 00:37:42,240
The Little Orange Man.I didn't tell you about him?

658
00:37:42,323 --> 00:37:44,117
No, ya didn't.

659
00:37:44,200 --> 00:37:46,327
He's my nemesis. About yea high.

660
00:37:46,411 --> 00:37:49,497
Comes in the dead of the night,and he steals all my chocolate.

661
00:37:49,581 --> 00:37:52,208
Been happening every few weeksfor the past three, four years now.

662
00:37:52,292 --> 00:37:53,293
Really?

663
00:37:53,376 --> 00:37:54,502
Sometimes I spy him

664
00:37:54,586 --> 00:37:56,963
in that strange realm'twixt sleep and wake,

665
00:37:57,046 --> 00:37:58,526
green hair glinting in the moonlight.

666
00:37:58,965 --> 00:37:59,965
Green hair?

667
00:38:00,008 --> 00:38:01,368
One day I shall catch him, Noodle.

668
00:38:01,426 --> 00:38:02,427
- Willy.- When I do...

669
00:38:02,510 --> 00:38:03,553
- Willy!- Hmm?

670
00:38:03,636 --> 00:38:06,306
You don't seriously expect meto believe this, do you?

671
00:38:06,389 --> 00:38:08,516
Of course I do.What other explanation is there?

672
00:38:08,600 --> 00:38:09,601
I don't know,

673
00:38:09,684 --> 00:38:11,269
- that you go to sleep...- Mmm-hmm.

674
00:38:11,352 --> 00:38:12,584
...dream 'bout Little Green Man...

675
00:38:12,604 --> 00:38:13,752
Orange man, green hair. Yeah.

676
00:38:13,772 --> 00:38:14,932
...and while you're dreaming,

677
00:38:14,981 --> 00:38:16,733
stuff your face with chocolate!

678
00:38:16,816 --> 00:38:18,026
Stuff my...

679
00:38:19,194 --> 00:38:20,216
That makes a lot more sense.

680
00:38:20,236 --> 00:38:21,342
Why'd I ever think this would work?

681
00:38:21,362 --> 00:38:22,594
I've been eating all my own chocolate?

682
00:38:22,614 --> 00:38:24,012
- Stupid Silver Linings.- I don't think I have been.

683
00:38:24,032 --> 00:38:25,033
Hey!

684
00:38:25,116 --> 00:38:26,785
There's nothing stupidabout my chocolate.

685
00:38:26,868 --> 00:38:30,872
If Mrs. Scrubitt had spotted us,I'd be in the coop right now.

686
00:38:30,955 --> 00:38:32,290
Look, I'm sorry, okay?

687
00:38:32,373 --> 00:38:34,167
But we can make more chocolate.

688
00:38:34,250 --> 00:38:35,835
Only problem is I'm all out of milk.

689
00:38:36,544 --> 00:38:38,338
Well, that's not a problem.

690
00:38:39,130 --> 00:38:40,590
Milk.

691
00:38:41,216 --> 00:38:43,176
A, that is stealing.

692
00:38:43,259 --> 00:38:44,344
And C,

693
00:38:44,427 --> 00:38:46,262
Willy Wonka does not useany old cow's milk.

694
00:38:46,805 --> 00:38:49,974
For this particular creation,I require the milk of a giraffe.

695
00:38:50,475 --> 00:38:52,185
Okay... fine.

696
00:38:52,268 --> 00:38:53,988
As a matter of fact,there's one at the zoo.

697
00:38:54,270 --> 00:38:55,270
Bingala!

698
00:38:55,313 --> 00:38:57,398
But, A, the zoo is not that way.

699
00:38:57,482 --> 00:38:58,483
Great.

700
00:38:58,566 --> 00:38:59,776
And, B,

701
00:39:00,401 --> 00:39:03,071
they're not gonna let you justwalk in there and milk it.

702
00:39:03,154 --> 00:39:06,783
Mmm. That, my dear Noodle,is why we're very lucky

703
00:39:06,866 --> 00:39:09,452
the Little Orange Man didn't find this.

704
00:39:14,082 --> 00:39:15,124
What is it?

705
00:39:15,208 --> 00:39:16,501
From Zoo Management.

706
00:39:16,584 --> 00:39:19,170
In recognition of your years of service.

707
00:39:19,963 --> 00:39:21,506
But I've only been here a year.

708
00:39:22,882 --> 00:39:26,094
Which is why there's only one chocolate.

709
00:39:27,095 --> 00:39:28,263
Huh.

710
00:39:28,346 --> 00:39:29,806
Well, thank you very much.

711
00:39:29,889 --> 00:39:31,641
You're welcome. Good night!

712
00:39:33,393 --> 00:39:34,561
Hey, well done, Noodle.

713
00:39:34,644 --> 00:39:36,646
So, what is it really?

714
00:39:36,729 --> 00:39:38,439
It's called A Big Night Out.

715
00:39:38,523 --> 00:39:40,630
A single chocolate that perfectlymimics a night on the town.

716
00:39:40,650 --> 00:39:41,651
Mmm.

717
00:39:41,734 --> 00:39:44,153
The outer layer, a champagne truffle.

718
00:39:44,237 --> 00:39:45,321
That's lovely.

719
00:39:45,405 --> 00:39:46,948
The next is white wine.

720
00:39:47,031 --> 00:39:48,031
Mmm.

721
00:39:48,074 --> 00:39:49,158
Followed by red.

722
00:39:49,242 --> 00:39:50,994
Now we are talking!

723
00:39:51,077 --> 00:39:52,757
That's when the singingand dancing starts.

724
00:39:55,832 --> 00:39:57,313
It's when he hitsthe layer o' whiskey fudge,

725
00:39:57,333 --> 00:39:58,585
he'll get emotional.

726
00:39:58,668 --> 00:40:01,212
She was the only woman I ever loved!

727
00:40:01,296 --> 00:40:03,298
He might do something reckless.

728
00:40:03,381 --> 00:40:04,632
I'll give her a call.

729
00:40:04,716 --> 00:40:06,801
What harm could it do?

730
00:40:07,260 --> 00:40:09,345
Hello, Gwennie? It's Basil.

731
00:40:09,429 --> 00:40:11,681
I just wanted to say,I've always loved you.

732
00:40:11,764 --> 00:40:13,850
I love you so much. What?

733
00:40:13,933 --> 00:40:16,769
It's Basil Bond.We sat together in chemistry at school.

734
00:40:16,853 --> 00:40:17,896
No, no, don't hang up!

735
00:40:17,979 --> 00:40:21,482
Finally, some old portfrom the back of the cupboard, and...

736
00:40:23,985 --> 00:40:25,069
Hmm.

737
00:40:25,153 --> 00:40:26,696
Let's go.

738
00:40:27,238 --> 00:40:28,364
Noodle, let's go.

739
00:40:30,658 --> 00:40:32,035
Why don't they fly away?

740
00:40:32,118 --> 00:40:33,328
I don't know.

741
00:40:33,786 --> 00:40:35,246
Perhaps they haven't thought of it.

742
00:40:35,330 --> 00:40:37,624
- You're kidding.- No, I'm serious.

743
00:40:37,707 --> 00:40:40,919
That's the thing about flamingos.They need someone to show 'em the way.

744
00:40:41,002 --> 00:40:42,003
Huh.

745
00:40:46,466 --> 00:40:47,634
Giraffe.

746
00:40:48,301 --> 00:40:51,471
Giraffe. Giraffe.

747
00:40:53,306 --> 00:40:54,766
Ah! Giraffe.

748
00:41:00,647 --> 00:41:02,440
You have got to learn how to read.

749
00:41:02,732 --> 00:41:03,733
Why?

750
00:41:04,150 --> 00:41:05,610
You were nearly eaten by a tiger.

751
00:41:05,693 --> 00:41:07,133
"Nearly" is the key word there, Noodle.

752
00:41:07,153 --> 00:41:08,760
I've nearly been eatenby a lot of things,

753
00:41:08,780 --> 00:41:10,573
and none of them got more than a nibble.

754
00:41:12,408 --> 00:41:13,743
Giraffe.

755
00:41:13,826 --> 00:41:15,286
Okay, I'll learn how to read.

756
00:41:35,390 --> 00:41:38,643
Good evening, Miss, um...

757
00:41:39,268 --> 00:41:40,812
- Abigail.- Abigail.

758
00:41:41,980 --> 00:41:43,523
Whoa! Easy, now.

759
00:41:43,606 --> 00:41:44,983
I brought acacia mints.

760
00:41:51,698 --> 00:41:52,699
Oh.

761
00:41:53,241 --> 00:41:56,035
Giraffes are just crazyabout my acacia mints.

762
00:41:56,119 --> 00:41:57,439
Love 'em more than anything else.

763
00:41:57,954 --> 00:41:59,794
Except being scratchedunder the chin, you see?

764
00:42:02,625 --> 00:42:03,865
You wanna give it a go, Noodle?

765
00:42:04,043 --> 00:42:05,044
Me?

766
00:42:05,586 --> 00:42:06,963
Yeah. Why not?

767
00:42:08,548 --> 00:42:09,548
Okay.

768
00:42:14,971 --> 00:42:15,972
- Ugh!- Oh!

769
00:42:16,055 --> 00:42:18,391
Think she likes you.

770
00:42:20,018 --> 00:42:21,269
Miss Abigail,

771
00:42:21,936 --> 00:42:24,313
if my colleague heregives you a good scratch,

772
00:42:24,397 --> 00:42:27,316
do you think you could possiblyspare us a pint or two of your milk?

773
00:42:32,321 --> 00:42:35,283
So, have you done this before?

774
00:42:35,366 --> 00:42:37,493
- Once. In Africa.

775
00:42:37,577 --> 00:42:39,495
Magnificent beast.

776
00:42:39,579 --> 00:42:41,581
- Was she wild?- Wild?

777
00:42:41,998 --> 00:42:43,583
She was absolutely furious.

778
00:42:44,459 --> 00:42:46,252
You sure can be silly, Willy.

779
00:42:46,335 --> 00:42:48,504
I suppose that's true-dle, Noodle.

780
00:42:48,588 --> 00:42:49,756
True-dle?

781
00:42:50,465 --> 00:42:51,545
That doesn't work, does it?

782
00:42:51,966 --> 00:42:53,634
Nothing rhymes with Noodle.

783
00:42:54,010 --> 00:42:55,678
Where'd you get that name, anyway?

784
00:42:56,220 --> 00:42:57,221
Doesn't matter.

785
00:42:58,056 --> 00:42:59,098
No, go on.

786
00:43:01,976 --> 00:43:02,977
This.

787
00:43:04,562 --> 00:43:07,106
It's all I have of my real parents. See?

788
00:43:07,565 --> 00:43:11,069
"N" for Noodle. Or Nora, or Nina,

789
00:43:12,070 --> 00:43:13,488
or nothing at all.

790
00:43:14,238 --> 00:43:15,448
Can't you trace the owner?

791
00:43:15,531 --> 00:43:16,866
You don't think I've tried?

792
00:43:17,909 --> 00:43:19,077
When I was a Kid,

793
00:43:19,911 --> 00:43:21,662
I always hoped that I'd find my parents.

794
00:43:23,164 --> 00:43:26,501
And they'd live in this beautifulold building full of books.

795
00:43:27,043 --> 00:43:30,922
My mom, she'd be waiting therefor me at the door,

796
00:43:31,005 --> 00:43:32,340
and I'd run into her arms.

797
00:43:32,423 --> 00:43:35,343
She'd give me this big huglike she'd never let me go.

798
00:43:38,346 --> 00:43:40,640
But then I realizedit was just a stupid dream.

799
00:43:43,476 --> 00:43:44,836
There's nothing stupid about that.

800
00:43:45,269 --> 00:43:46,270
Isn't there?

801
00:43:47,230 --> 00:43:49,732
I know thingshaven't been easy for you, Noodle.

802
00:43:49,816 --> 00:43:51,025
But they're gonna get better.

803
00:43:51,484 --> 00:43:53,986
I'm not gonna let you rotin that Wash House forever.

804
00:43:54,570 --> 00:43:55,738
You promise?

805
00:43:55,822 --> 00:43:57,573
I can do better than that.

806
00:43:58,866 --> 00:44:00,326
I pinkie promise.

807
00:44:00,409 --> 00:44:02,245
And that's the most solemn vow there is.

808
00:44:05,373 --> 00:44:06,624
Get scratchin'.

809
00:44:07,542 --> 00:44:10,628
We don't have longuntil that guard comes to-dle, Noodle.

810
00:44:11,212 --> 00:44:13,798
- To-dle!- It's not even a word!

811
00:44:14,382 --> 00:44:15,508
Oh.

812
00:44:15,591 --> 00:44:17,135
I'm gonna keep working on it.

813
00:45:00,469 --> 00:45:02,430
I got it, Noodle! Listen to this.

814
00:45:26,662 --> 00:45:27,788
Willy!

815
00:45:33,085 --> 00:45:34,420
Thanks, Abigail!

816
00:46:43,739 --> 00:46:44,740
Chief,

817
00:46:45,199 --> 00:46:47,034
you know that fellayou wanted a word with?

818
00:47:14,729 --> 00:47:16,188
Mr. Wonka!

819
00:47:16,272 --> 00:47:17,815
A word in private, if I may.

820
00:47:18,232 --> 00:47:19,942
Certainly, Officer.

821
00:47:20,026 --> 00:47:21,944
- Be on your way, Affable.- Are you sure, sir?

822
00:47:22,028 --> 00:47:24,613
Oh, yeah.This is between me and Mr. Wonka.

823
00:47:24,697 --> 00:47:25,761
You better get outta here, Noodle.

824
00:47:25,781 --> 00:47:27,283
- But Willy...- Don't worry about me.

825
00:47:27,366 --> 00:47:28,973
I've talked my way outof tighter spots than this.

826
00:47:28,993 --> 00:47:30,233
I'll meet you back at the cart.

827
00:47:31,579 --> 00:47:33,539
Now, Officer, if this is about Abigail...

828
00:47:33,622 --> 00:47:35,124
I got a message for you, pal.

829
00:47:35,207 --> 00:47:36,208
Whoa! No.

830
00:47:37,501 --> 00:47:40,463
Do not sell chocolate in this town!

831
00:47:41,297 --> 00:47:43,090
- You got it?

832
00:47:44,383 --> 00:47:46,135
Not really, I'm afraid.

833
00:47:46,218 --> 00:47:48,387
Oh, so you got a mouthon you, huh, Candy Man?

834
00:47:48,888 --> 00:47:49,888
I said...

835
00:47:50,222 --> 00:47:53,142
- Don't sell chocolate!

836
00:47:54,518 --> 00:47:55,561
You hear me that time?

837
00:47:56,228 --> 00:47:57,646
I have water in my ears.

838
00:47:58,606 --> 00:47:59,690
Oh.

839
00:47:59,774 --> 00:48:01,692
Yeah, that... You've...

840
00:48:01,776 --> 00:48:03,235
Okay, that makes sense. Yeah.

841
00:48:03,903 --> 00:48:05,946
Listen, I'm sorry.

842
00:48:06,030 --> 00:48:07,782
I'm all outta whack.

843
00:48:07,865 --> 00:48:10,576
Truth is, I don't wanna be doin' this.

844
00:48:10,659 --> 00:48:12,328
I don't want you to be doing this.

845
00:48:12,411 --> 00:48:14,038
But I still gotta give ya a message.

846
00:48:14,121 --> 00:48:16,248
Sell chocolate in this town again,

847
00:48:16,332 --> 00:48:18,334
you're gonna get morethan a bonk on the head.

848
00:48:18,876 --> 00:48:20,252
I don't have a bonk on the head.

849
00:48:22,338 --> 00:48:24,215
What is with me today? I...

850
00:48:24,715 --> 00:48:25,863
Can you give me just a second?

851
00:48:25,883 --> 00:48:26,884
Sure.

852
00:48:29,762 --> 00:48:31,389
Lord Bleachowitz.

853
00:48:31,472 --> 00:48:32,640
Mrs. Scrubitt.

854
00:48:32,723 --> 00:48:36,852
Your eyes are like two rabbit droppingsin a couple of bowls of custard.

855
00:48:36,936 --> 00:48:37,812
Oh!

856
00:48:37,895 --> 00:48:39,438
You really do have a way with words.

857
00:48:40,481 --> 00:48:41,482
See you downstairs.

858
00:48:41,565 --> 00:48:43,359
Geronimo!

859
00:48:43,901 --> 00:48:45,319
Ah, Mr. Wonka.

860
00:48:45,736 --> 00:48:47,113
- Good of you to join us.

861
00:48:47,571 --> 00:48:49,698
- Not late, am I?- Well, no.

862
00:48:49,782 --> 00:48:51,325
Cutting it a bit fine, but...

863
00:48:51,409 --> 00:48:52,848
- Has Tiddles been pulling his weight?

864
00:48:52,868 --> 00:48:55,121
As a matter of fact,Tiddles has been a very good boy,

865
00:48:55,204 --> 00:48:57,248
- and productivity is up 30%.

866
00:48:57,331 --> 00:48:58,791
We took the afternoon off.

867
00:48:58,874 --> 00:48:59,959
But that's not the point.

868
00:49:00,042 --> 00:49:01,335
This is the point.

869
00:49:01,419 --> 00:49:02,670
- Not now, Larry.- Sorry.

870
00:49:02,753 --> 00:49:03,754
The point is...

871
00:49:04,463 --> 00:49:05,464
Where have you been?

872
00:49:05,548 --> 00:49:07,675
And why do you smell of giraffe?

873
00:49:08,676 --> 00:49:10,886
- Guess I owe you guys an explanation.- Mmm.

874
00:49:10,970 --> 00:49:13,347
The truth is, I'm a chocolate maker.

875
00:49:13,431 --> 00:49:16,934
Not just any chocolate.The best in the world.

876
00:49:17,017 --> 00:49:20,896
Ah, well, Noodle's flattering me,but she's right. They're exquisite.

877
00:49:20,980 --> 00:49:24,024
Plan is to sell chocolateand pay off Mrs. Scrubitt.

878
00:49:24,108 --> 00:49:26,193
At least that was the plan, until...

879
00:49:26,277 --> 00:49:27,403
Oh, let me guess.

880
00:49:27,486 --> 00:49:30,573
You had a little run-inwith the Chief of Police?

881
00:49:31,115 --> 00:49:32,116
How do you know that?

882
00:49:32,199 --> 00:49:36,787
Because I was Slugworth's accountant.For a week, at least.

883
00:49:37,246 --> 00:49:38,914
His regular bookkeeper was off sick.

884
00:49:38,998 --> 00:49:39,915
Station, please.

885
00:49:39,999 --> 00:49:43,210
And I was called halfwayacross the country to take his place.

886
00:49:43,294 --> 00:49:45,129
Good evening, Mr. Slugworth.

887
00:49:45,212 --> 00:49:47,798
I just need your signature on...

888
00:49:47,882 --> 00:49:49,925
Seemed a straightforward job.

889
00:49:50,009 --> 00:49:51,093
Oh.

890
00:49:51,177 --> 00:49:55,431
Until I realizedthere were two sets of books.

891
00:49:55,848 --> 00:49:57,516
One for the authorities,

892
00:49:58,058 --> 00:50:00,144
and one which told the truth.

893
00:50:01,061 --> 00:50:06,859
Slugworth, Fickelgruber and Prodnosehave been in cahoots for years.

894
00:50:06,942 --> 00:50:09,612
A sort of chocolate cartel, if you will.

895
00:50:09,695 --> 00:50:11,822
They've been watering downtheir chocolate

896
00:50:11,906 --> 00:50:16,452
and storing the excess in a secret vaultdeep beneath the cathedral,

897
00:50:16,535 --> 00:50:19,246
guarded round the clockby a corrupt cleric

898
00:50:19,330 --> 00:50:22,291
and 500 chocoholic monks.

899
00:50:23,626 --> 00:50:26,253
The only way in is downa secret elevator,

900
00:50:26,795 --> 00:50:28,923
and past the Mistress of the Keys.

901
00:50:29,965 --> 00:50:31,926
- A subterranean sentinel...

902
00:50:32,009 --> 00:50:34,094
...who hasn't seen sunlight in years.

903
00:50:34,178 --> 00:50:35,221
Good evening.

904
00:50:35,304 --> 00:50:37,932
There's thousandsof gallons of chocolate down there,

905
00:50:38,015 --> 00:50:41,894
and the Cartel use it to bribe, blackmail

906
00:50:42,061 --> 00:50:44,063
and bludgeon the competition.

907
00:50:44,522 --> 00:50:46,282
I do not care thatthey were school children,

908
00:50:46,357 --> 00:50:47,358
- they were in our way.

909
00:50:47,441 --> 00:50:48,901
Next time, put your foot down.

910
00:50:48,984 --> 00:50:49,985
Miss Bon-Bon?

911
00:50:50,069 --> 00:50:51,237
Good morning, Mr. Slugworth.

912
00:50:51,320 --> 00:50:54,657
From now on, I'll be keepingthe ledger in the vault.

913
00:50:54,740 --> 00:50:55,783
Very good, sir.

914
00:50:57,451 --> 00:50:58,494
Oh, and Mr. Crunch?

915
00:51:00,204 --> 00:51:01,205
Yes?

916
00:51:01,580 --> 00:51:02,623
You're fired.

917
00:51:04,792 --> 00:51:05,793
Very good, sir.

918
00:51:07,461 --> 00:51:08,879
I'm sorry, Mr. Wonka,

919
00:51:09,463 --> 00:51:12,508
but they've got youright where they want you.

920
00:51:12,591 --> 00:51:15,302
You can't get a shopwithout selling chocolate,

921
00:51:15,386 --> 00:51:19,098
and you can't sell chocolatewithout a shop.

922
00:51:21,809 --> 00:51:23,269
Hey, Noodle!

923
00:51:23,352 --> 00:51:24,853
Noodle! Psst!

924
00:51:26,564 --> 00:51:27,565
What is it, Willy?

925
00:51:27,648 --> 00:51:28,649
Watch out.

926
00:51:28,983 --> 00:51:30,025
Whoa!

927
00:51:35,447 --> 00:51:36,615
What's this for?

928
00:51:37,074 --> 00:51:40,160
Your wages. A lifetime supply, remember?

929
00:51:40,661 --> 00:51:43,080
- You didn't have to do that.- Of course I did.

930
00:51:43,455 --> 00:51:44,790
I gave you my word.

931
00:51:45,541 --> 00:51:47,668
Well, thanks.

932
00:51:48,252 --> 00:51:50,296
- I've got something for you too.- For me?

933
00:51:56,302 --> 00:51:57,595
What's this?

934
00:51:57,678 --> 00:51:59,763
- Glass half full?- Other way up.

935
00:52:00,556 --> 00:52:01,557
Glass half empty.

936
00:52:02,099 --> 00:52:04,018
It's an "A." Your first letter.

937
00:52:04,602 --> 00:52:07,396
- I'm teaching you to read.- Oh, Noodle.

938
00:52:07,813 --> 00:52:10,065
Well, I can't havemy business partner eaten by a tiger.

939
00:52:10,482 --> 00:52:12,401
Or nearly eaten.

940
00:52:12,484 --> 00:52:13,652
So we're still partners?

941
00:52:13,736 --> 00:52:16,447
Sure, but I don't knowhow we're gonna sell any chocolate.

942
00:52:16,864 --> 00:52:19,464
Every time the police show up,you'd have to vanish into thin air.

943
00:52:20,034 --> 00:52:21,118
Like a magician.

944
00:52:21,201 --> 00:52:22,620
Right!

945
00:52:22,703 --> 00:52:24,463
Yeah, but it's one thingwhen you're onstage.

946
00:52:24,997 --> 00:52:27,374
You have ropes and pulleysand trapdoors.

947
00:52:27,458 --> 00:52:28,897
There's none of those on the street.

948
00:52:28,917 --> 00:52:30,836
As a matter of fact, there are.

949
00:52:31,295 --> 00:52:32,963
There are trapdoors all over the city.

950
00:52:33,047 --> 00:52:34,798
They're called storm drains.

951
00:52:34,882 --> 00:52:37,509
I'd be happy to show you aroundif you cut me in on the action.

952
00:52:38,552 --> 00:52:40,804
If you're recruiting,I'd do anything to get out of here

953
00:52:40,888 --> 00:52:42,222
and make up with my wife.

954
00:52:42,306 --> 00:52:44,975
I don't have any practical skills, but...

955
00:52:45,059 --> 00:52:47,603
I can talk like I'm underwater.

956
00:52:47,686 --> 00:52:49,897
And if you need someoneto handle communications,

957
00:52:50,272 --> 00:52:51,565
I'm your woman.

958
00:52:51,649 --> 00:52:52,775
Lottie?

959
00:52:53,817 --> 00:52:55,097
What? Why you all staring at me?

960
00:52:55,152 --> 00:52:57,446
I did not know she could speak.

961
00:52:57,529 --> 00:52:58,947
I thought you were a mime.

962
00:52:59,031 --> 00:53:02,451
No, I actually used to workat the telephone exchange.

963
00:53:02,534 --> 00:53:04,828
But back then, I was quite the chatterbox.

964
00:53:05,663 --> 00:53:06,914
But since I came here,

965
00:53:08,207 --> 00:53:10,334
- I haven't had much to chat about.

966
00:53:10,417 --> 00:53:13,837
Far be it from meto pour cold water on all your fun,

967
00:53:13,921 --> 00:53:16,298
but if Mrs. Scrubittcatches you trying to escape,

968
00:53:16,382 --> 00:53:19,093
you'll all get six months in the coop.

969
00:53:19,176 --> 00:53:20,511
So just think about that

970
00:53:20,594 --> 00:53:23,681
before getting involvedin this harebrained scheme.

971
00:53:23,764 --> 00:53:26,100
But it's not harebrained, Abacus.

972
00:53:26,183 --> 00:53:29,353
Willy's chocolates are incredible.Try one.

973
00:53:29,937 --> 00:53:31,397
That's very kind of you, Noodle.

974
00:53:31,480 --> 00:53:33,941
I don't care how goodhis chocolates are.

975
00:53:35,734 --> 00:53:36,860
When do we start?

976
00:53:48,539 --> 00:53:51,625
I guess what I'm trying to say,Barbara, is, um, will you marry me?

977
00:53:51,709 --> 00:53:54,294
Oh... I dunno, Colin.

978
00:53:54,378 --> 00:53:55,984
You're a lovely man,but I'm looking for someone

979
00:53:56,004 --> 00:53:59,758
to sweep me off my feet. You know,whisk me off to a life of adventure.

980
00:54:00,300 --> 00:54:01,593
Could that be you?

981
00:54:02,594 --> 00:54:04,221
- No.- Oh.

982
00:54:04,304 --> 00:54:06,807
Not with my chroniclack of self-confidence.

983
00:54:06,932 --> 00:54:09,518
- Uh, I best be off.- Oh, but Colin...

984
00:54:09,601 --> 00:54:11,311
Sorry to have wasted your time, Barbara.

985
00:54:11,854 --> 00:54:13,188
Uh, taxi!

986
00:54:19,611 --> 00:54:20,904
Uh, monsieur, can I help you?

987
00:54:20,988 --> 00:54:22,114
Oh, waiter.

988
00:54:22,990 --> 00:54:24,867
Do you have anything for a broken heart?

989
00:54:33,459 --> 00:54:34,460
It's true.

990
00:54:42,885 --> 00:54:44,178
Have you been following me?

991
00:55:10,871 --> 00:55:12,080
He doesn't even work here.

992
00:57:09,531 --> 00:57:10,571
- I understand that, yeah.

993
00:57:11,366 --> 00:57:12,366
- Totally true.

994
00:57:15,245 --> 00:57:17,085
Yes, but whatI'm trying to tell you is that...

995
00:57:22,586 --> 00:57:23,629
But, fellas...

996
00:58:16,264 --> 00:58:17,391
All right, where is he?

997
00:58:17,474 --> 00:58:19,559
- Where'd he go?

998
00:58:30,445 --> 00:58:31,822
So that's how you're doin' it.

999
00:58:33,365 --> 00:58:34,365
Affable,

1000
00:58:34,408 --> 00:58:37,744
I want a man on everystorm drain in the city.

1001
00:58:37,828 --> 00:58:39,121
Are you sure, sir?

1002
00:58:39,204 --> 00:58:41,456
Shouldn't we be focusing onall those unsolved murders?

1003
00:58:41,540 --> 00:58:43,458
No, no, no, no, this is the priority.

1004
00:58:43,542 --> 00:58:44,626
Okay...

1005
00:58:49,131 --> 00:58:50,988
Okay, you know what?I'm gonna need your help up.

1006
00:58:51,008 --> 00:58:52,175
Yep, there we go.

1007
00:58:52,259 --> 00:58:54,761
Pretty sure I've gained about 150 poundsin the last two weeks.

1008
00:59:28,211 --> 00:59:29,212
Ooh!

1009
01:00:00,118 --> 01:00:01,119
Gotcha!

1010
01:00:01,828 --> 01:00:02,871
What the devil?

1011
01:00:02,954 --> 01:00:04,289
Let me out of here.

1012
01:00:04,372 --> 01:00:05,791
I demand to be released.

1013
01:00:05,874 --> 01:00:07,793
Incredible. It can speak.

1014
01:00:07,876 --> 01:00:09,127
Well, of course I can speak.

1015
01:00:09,211 --> 01:00:10,921
Now let me out of here,or I shall shriek.

1016
01:00:11,004 --> 01:00:12,798
- Wow.- Let me out!

1017
01:00:12,881 --> 01:00:15,175
Not until I take a good look at you.

1018
01:00:16,885 --> 01:00:18,053
- Wow.

1019
01:00:18,136 --> 01:00:19,137
Good evening.

1020
01:00:19,221 --> 01:00:21,973
So you're the funny little manwho's been following me.

1021
01:00:22,099 --> 01:00:24,226
"Funny little man"? How dare you.

1022
01:00:24,601 --> 01:00:25,894
I will have you know that I am

1023
01:00:25,977 --> 01:00:28,313
a perfectly respectable sizefor an Oompa Loompa.

1024
01:00:29,356 --> 01:00:30,356
An Oompa-what-now?

1025
01:00:30,398 --> 01:00:33,944
In fact, in Loompaland,I am regarded as something of a whopper.

1026
01:00:34,027 --> 01:00:35,737
- They call me Lofty.

1027
01:00:35,821 --> 01:00:37,739
So, I will thank youto stop gawping at me

1028
01:00:37,823 --> 01:00:40,180
as though I was something unpleasantyou'd found in your handkerchief.

1029
01:00:40,200 --> 01:00:43,745
I find it uncomfortableand, frankly, rude.

1030
01:00:44,162 --> 01:00:45,413
Um...

1031
01:00:45,497 --> 01:00:46,873
- Sorry.- Now let me out of here.

1032
01:00:46,957 --> 01:00:48,708
You have absolutely no right

1033
01:00:48,792 --> 01:00:51,002
to go aroundembottling innocent strangers.

1034
01:00:51,086 --> 01:00:52,087
Innocent?

1035
01:00:52,170 --> 01:00:54,840
Hold on, you've beenstealing from me. For years.

1036
01:00:54,923 --> 01:00:56,466
Well, you started it.

1037
01:00:56,550 --> 01:00:57,551
Me?

1038
01:00:57,634 --> 01:00:59,177
You stole our cocoa beans.

1039
01:01:00,011 --> 01:01:01,346
What are you talking about?

1040
01:01:02,681 --> 01:01:05,559
Do you meanthat you don't even remember?

1041
01:01:05,642 --> 01:01:06,893
Remember what?

1042
01:01:07,435 --> 01:01:08,687
The day you...

1043
01:01:10,355 --> 01:01:12,190
destroyed my life.

1044
01:01:12,274 --> 01:01:14,317
No, I don't remember that.

1045
01:01:14,734 --> 01:01:15,777
Well then, young man.

1046
01:01:15,861 --> 01:01:17,612
Allow me to refresh your memory

1047
01:01:17,946 --> 01:01:20,699
in the form of a songso ruinously catchy

1048
01:01:20,782 --> 01:01:22,742
that it may never leave your mind.

1049
01:01:23,910 --> 01:01:25,350
Oh, I don't think I wanna hear that.

1050
01:01:25,412 --> 01:01:26,538
- Too late.

1051
01:01:26,621 --> 01:01:27,956
I've started dancing now.

1052
01:01:28,039 --> 01:01:29,875
Once we've started,we can't stop, you see.

1053
01:01:59,446 --> 01:02:00,989
Hey, why didn't you say something?

1054
01:02:01,072 --> 01:02:02,407
Well, perhaps I drifted off.

1055
01:02:17,172 --> 01:02:19,549
A thousandfold?You gotta be kidding me!

1056
01:02:19,633 --> 01:02:20,800
I repeat...

1057
01:02:25,055 --> 01:02:26,556
Hah. Wow.

1058
01:02:26,640 --> 01:02:28,808
Um... Mr. Loompa,

1059
01:02:28,892 --> 01:02:30,624
if you really thinkthat's a reasonable penalty

1060
01:02:30,644 --> 01:02:32,020
for taking three beans...

1061
01:02:32,103 --> 01:02:33,103
Four beans.

1062
01:02:33,355 --> 01:02:34,356
...four beans,

1063
01:02:34,439 --> 01:02:36,379
then I'm sure we can cometo some sort of understanding.

1064
01:02:36,399 --> 01:02:38,401
But I can't give you my entire supply.

1065
01:02:38,860 --> 01:02:40,320
I got people counting on me.

1066
01:02:40,820 --> 01:02:42,739
Hmm.

1067
01:02:42,822 --> 01:02:44,950
Very well. I tell you what.

1068
01:02:45,533 --> 01:02:46,534
You let me out of here,

1069
01:02:46,618 --> 01:02:49,412
and we can discuss it,like gentlemen. Hmm?

1070
01:02:50,830 --> 01:02:51,873
All right.

1071
01:02:53,583 --> 01:02:55,043
Ah, thank you.

1072
01:02:55,126 --> 01:02:59,256
Now, would you be so very kindas to pass me that miniature frying pan?

1073
01:02:59,339 --> 01:03:00,715
Hmm. This one?

1074
01:03:00,799 --> 01:03:02,842
No, no. The heavier one, please.

1075
01:03:02,926 --> 01:03:03,927
All right.

1076
01:03:04,803 --> 01:03:05,929
Thank you. Thank you very...

1077
01:03:06,012 --> 01:03:08,014
Ooh, I say,that is quite a beast, isn't it?

1078
01:03:08,098 --> 01:03:09,138
Now, come a little closer.

1079
01:03:09,766 --> 01:03:10,997
That's it, closer, closer, closer.

1080
01:03:11,017 --> 01:03:12,123
- Come on, cozy on up.- Okay.

1081
01:03:12,143 --> 01:03:14,312
- There we are.- What?

1082
01:03:14,396 --> 01:03:15,605
- Ow!

1083
01:03:18,275 --> 01:03:19,317
Ow!

1084
01:03:19,401 --> 01:03:21,528
Oompa Loompas do not negotiate.

1085
01:03:21,611 --> 01:03:22,696
- Good day, sir.

1086
01:03:22,779 --> 01:03:24,114
But that's my last jar!

1087
01:03:24,197 --> 01:03:26,324
I said, good day.

1088
01:03:28,702 --> 01:03:30,161
- He came back?

1089
01:03:30,704 --> 01:03:32,664
Yes, Noodle, but this time I set a trap.

1090
01:03:32,747 --> 01:03:34,124
And he walked right into it.

1091
01:03:34,791 --> 01:03:35,917
So, where is he?

1092
01:03:36,001 --> 01:03:38,253
Ah, well, we had a fight, you see.He won.

1093
01:03:38,336 --> 01:03:41,089
Hit me on the head with a frying panand jumped out of the window.

1094
01:03:41,172 --> 01:03:43,133
Of course he did.

1095
01:03:44,301 --> 01:03:45,461
You don't believe me, do you?

1096
01:03:45,885 --> 01:03:47,137
Honestly? No.

1097
01:03:47,220 --> 01:03:48,263
No!

1098
01:03:48,346 --> 01:03:49,347
No.

1099
01:03:49,431 --> 01:03:51,099
- No.- Definitely not.

1100
01:03:51,182 --> 01:03:55,687
But, as it so happens,we don't need to sell chocolate today.

1101
01:03:55,937 --> 01:03:56,937
And why is that?

1102
01:03:56,980 --> 01:03:59,691
You know that shop?The one you've been dreaming of?

1103
01:04:15,332 --> 01:04:17,542
Now, I know what you're thinking.

1104
01:04:17,625 --> 01:04:20,337
It may need a little work.

1105
01:04:21,796 --> 01:04:23,465
Looks like someoneleft the water running

1106
01:04:23,548 --> 01:04:25,925
20 years ago and the ceiling fell through.

1107
01:04:26,009 --> 01:04:28,511
And the ceiling above that,and the ceiling above that.

1108
01:04:28,595 --> 01:04:30,680
But that means we can afford it.

1109
01:04:30,764 --> 01:04:32,390
For a week, anyway.

1110
01:04:32,474 --> 01:04:34,100
And we'd finally be legitimate.

1111
01:04:34,184 --> 01:04:36,644
The police wouldn't have any excuseto keep bothering us.

1112
01:04:38,229 --> 01:04:40,106
So, what do you think, Willy?

1113
01:04:40,648 --> 01:04:41,649
Do you like it?

1114
01:04:44,027 --> 01:04:45,153
Do I like it?

1115
01:04:48,406 --> 01:04:50,325
Noodle, it's just as I always imagined.

1116
01:04:50,408 --> 01:04:53,661
No, scratch that,it's better than I imagined.

1117
01:04:53,745 --> 01:04:54,996
I mean, look at this place.

1118
01:04:55,080 --> 01:04:57,415
mean, yeah, it's a wreck,but... the potential!

1119
01:04:57,499 --> 01:04:58,500
- The bones!

1120
01:04:58,583 --> 01:04:59,584
You mark my words,

1121
01:04:59,667 --> 01:05:02,420
this is gonna be the best chocolate shopthe world has ever seen.

1122
01:05:02,504 --> 01:05:03,380
Whoo!

1123
01:05:03,463 --> 01:05:05,111
You won't be scrub-scrubbin'much longer, Noodle.

1124
01:05:05,131 --> 01:05:06,633
- We'll all be free.

1125
01:05:06,716 --> 01:05:08,343
As free as flamingos!

1126
01:05:20,605 --> 01:05:23,191
There's six of them in total,including the little girl.

1127
01:05:23,775 --> 01:05:26,027
She seems to bethe brains of the operation.

1128
01:05:26,111 --> 01:05:29,155
They're based out of a laundrycalled Scrubitt and Bleacher.

1129
01:05:29,239 --> 01:05:31,116
Scrubitt's?

1130
01:05:31,199 --> 01:05:32,200
That's right.

1131
01:05:32,534 --> 01:05:33,535
Why, you know it?

1132
01:05:33,618 --> 01:05:35,912
Yes, as a matter of fact, I do.

1133
01:05:35,995 --> 01:05:38,623
They just rented a shop.So, legally, I can't touch them.

1134
01:05:38,706 --> 01:05:42,210
But illegally, I'm happy to dowhatever you guys want.

1135
01:05:42,293 --> 01:05:43,775
You want 'em allto have a little accident?

1136
01:05:43,795 --> 01:05:45,046
In which they die?

1137
01:05:45,130 --> 01:05:46,381
Not a problem.

1138
01:05:46,464 --> 01:05:48,299
But it's gonna cost youa lot more chocolate.

1139
01:05:48,383 --> 01:05:49,384
It's all right, Chief.

1140
01:05:49,467 --> 01:05:52,137
And also, I'd, uh,be grateful for an advance.

1141
01:05:52,220 --> 01:05:53,847
'Cause the last boxes you gave me...

1142
01:05:54,431 --> 01:05:55,432
they're gone.

1143
01:05:55,974 --> 01:05:56,850
All of them?

1144
01:05:56,933 --> 01:05:58,498
I've been eatingthese little paper cases

1145
01:05:58,518 --> 01:06:00,019
for the... for the past three days.

1146
01:06:00,103 --> 01:06:02,210
You know, you think they'regonna give you the same hit.

1147
01:06:02,230 --> 01:06:03,648
They don't.

1148
01:06:04,441 --> 01:06:05,442
Oh.

1149
01:06:05,525 --> 01:06:06,693
There you go, Chief.

1150
01:06:07,152 --> 01:06:08,945
There's plenty morewhere that came from.

1151
01:06:09,028 --> 01:06:10,697
You stand down for now.

1152
01:06:10,780 --> 01:06:12,540
We'll give you a callwhen the time is right.

1153
01:06:19,205 --> 01:06:21,499
- What is it, Arthur?- The girl.

1154
01:06:21,583 --> 01:06:24,335
You don't really thinkit could be her, do you?

1155
01:06:24,961 --> 01:06:26,171
I do.

1156
01:06:26,254 --> 01:06:29,466
You always assured usshe wouldn't be a problem.

1157
01:06:29,549 --> 01:06:31,509
He's right. You did assure us.

1158
01:06:31,593 --> 01:06:32,594
And she won't be.

1159
01:06:33,261 --> 01:06:34,679
Nor will Wonka.

1160
01:06:34,762 --> 01:06:37,390
I'll see to it, personally.

1161
01:06:40,477 --> 01:06:41,603
Who is it? What do you want?

1162
01:06:45,148 --> 01:06:47,442
Mr. Slugworth.

1163
01:06:47,525 --> 01:06:48,818
Just a minute, sir.

1164
01:06:50,153 --> 01:06:51,446
Good evening.

1165
01:06:51,946 --> 01:06:53,781
- Good evening.- Who is it, Puffy-wu...

1166
01:06:54,866 --> 01:06:57,452
- Stone me. It's Mr. Slugworth.

1167
01:06:57,535 --> 01:06:59,621
To what do we owe the honor?

1168
01:06:59,996 --> 01:07:02,665
You have a guest. A Mr. Wonka?

1169
01:07:02,749 --> 01:07:05,960
He's been sneaking out to sell chocolatewith the help of your serving girl.

1170
01:07:06,044 --> 01:07:07,754
Why, that little brat.

1171
01:07:07,837 --> 01:07:08,922
Well, quite.

1172
01:07:09,464 --> 01:07:14,427
I wondered if you might help meput an end to their... business.

1173
01:07:23,853 --> 01:07:25,271
Here we go, Mamma.

1174
01:07:35,448 --> 01:07:38,201
Ladies and gentlemen,greetings to you all,

1175
01:07:38,284 --> 01:07:40,787
and welcome to Wonka's.

1176
01:07:41,538 --> 01:07:46,501
Tremendous things are in store,both literally and metaphorically.

1177
01:07:46,584 --> 01:07:47,585
What?

1178
01:07:48,294 --> 01:07:49,379
In there?

1179
01:07:50,505 --> 01:07:51,548
Humor me.

1180
01:09:51,501 --> 01:09:52,502
Mmm!

1181
01:11:25,303 --> 01:11:28,306
So, mushrooms,pears, assorted flowers.

1182
01:11:28,389 --> 01:11:30,808
That comes to 89 sovereigns.

1183
01:11:31,392 --> 01:11:33,561
A bargain at twice the price.

1184
01:11:33,644 --> 01:11:36,981
Thank you, sir.And how would you like your change?

1185
01:11:37,064 --> 01:11:39,025
Spendable or edible?

1186
01:11:39,317 --> 01:11:40,777
Oh, edible, please.

1187
01:11:42,445 --> 01:11:44,280
- Enjoy.

1188
01:11:44,363 --> 01:11:46,324
And, uh, don't forgetto eat your basket.

1189
01:11:46,407 --> 01:11:47,492
- Oh.- No, no, no.

1190
01:11:47,575 --> 01:11:48,639
Hold your place in the queue.

1191
01:11:48,659 --> 01:11:51,037
Abacus, that man justgave us 100 sovereigns.

1192
01:11:51,120 --> 01:11:52,955
- I know, Noodle!

1193
01:11:53,498 --> 01:11:54,499
Who's next?

1194
01:11:54,582 --> 01:11:55,583
- That'll be me.- Me!

1195
01:12:00,379 --> 01:12:01,380
Uh...

1196
01:12:01,464 --> 01:12:02,507
Mr. Wonka?

1197
01:12:02,590 --> 01:12:03,716
Yes?

1198
01:12:04,884 --> 01:12:06,385
What's going on here?

1199
01:12:06,469 --> 01:12:09,138
Oh, my goodness. That's impossible.

1200
01:12:09,222 --> 01:12:10,389
Unless...

1201
01:12:13,810 --> 01:12:14,852
Yeti sweat?

1202
01:12:15,353 --> 01:12:16,562
Yeti sweat?

1203
01:12:16,646 --> 01:12:18,606
The most powerfulhair potion in the world.

1204
01:12:18,689 --> 01:12:19,941
But I didn't put it in there.

1205
01:12:20,942 --> 01:12:23,486
Ladies and gentlemen!Your attention, please!

1206
01:12:23,569 --> 01:12:25,404
There appearsto be a manufacturing error.

1207
01:12:25,488 --> 01:12:27,156
Nobody eat the flowers!

1208
01:12:27,240 --> 01:12:29,367
Uh, why not?

1209
01:12:29,742 --> 01:12:30,785
What's wrong with them?

1210
01:12:30,868 --> 01:12:32,495
What's the matter with this toadstool?

1211
01:12:32,578 --> 01:12:35,039
My daughter took one bite,and just look at her!

1212
01:12:35,122 --> 01:12:38,209
There's nothing wrongwith the chocolate milk, is there?

1213
01:12:38,292 --> 01:12:39,460
I'm terribly sorry, everyone,

1214
01:12:39,544 --> 01:12:41,264
and I don't knowhow to explain this, but...

1215
01:12:41,671 --> 01:12:43,714
It appears that the chocolateshave been poisoned!

1216
01:12:43,798 --> 01:12:45,049
- Poisoned?

1217
01:12:45,132 --> 01:12:46,926
- Poisoned?- He poisoned my child!

1218
01:12:47,009 --> 01:12:48,553
I didn't... I didn't poison them.

1219
01:12:48,636 --> 01:12:50,304
- I want my money back.

1220
01:12:50,388 --> 01:12:51,556
I want compensation.

1221
01:12:51,639 --> 01:12:52,932
I want revenge.

1222
01:12:54,267 --> 01:12:55,476
Whoa!

1223
01:13:00,898 --> 01:13:01,899
No, no! Please!

1224
01:13:07,238 --> 01:13:09,866
This is what you get formustach-ing my daughter!

1225
01:13:13,119 --> 01:13:14,120
I'll wait for you.

1226
01:13:14,203 --> 01:13:15,803
Help!I have to get away from this place.

1227
01:13:17,248 --> 01:13:21,919
And that, I believe,is the end of Wonka's Chocolate Shop.

1228
01:13:41,731 --> 01:13:42,857
I don't understand. What...

1229
01:13:45,192 --> 01:13:46,192
What...

1230
01:13:47,320 --> 01:13:48,446
What happened?

1231
01:13:48,529 --> 01:13:49,530
Isn't it obvious?

1232
01:13:50,281 --> 01:13:52,116
The Chocolate Cartel.

1233
01:13:55,119 --> 01:13:57,371
It's okay, Willy. We can rebuild.

1234
01:13:57,830 --> 01:13:58,830
We can start again.

1235
01:13:59,332 --> 01:14:00,332
There's no point, Noodle.

1236
01:14:02,126 --> 01:14:03,127
It didn't work.

1237
01:14:04,086 --> 01:14:05,296
What do you mean?

1238
01:14:05,713 --> 01:14:07,006
She promised she would be here.

1239
01:14:09,383 --> 01:14:10,468
She wasn't.

1240
01:14:11,427 --> 01:14:13,804
- You didn't actually think that...- No, I did.

1241
01:14:16,974 --> 01:14:18,184
Stupid dream.

1242
01:14:18,267 --> 01:14:20,478
Don't say that, Willy.Please don't ever...

1243
01:14:20,561 --> 01:14:21,562
Come on, Noodle.

1244
01:14:22,521 --> 01:14:25,024
I think Mr. Wonka needs to be alone.

1245
01:14:37,453 --> 01:14:41,457
Every good thingin this world started with a dream.

1246
01:14:45,127 --> 01:14:46,879
So you hold on to yours.

1247
01:14:48,798 --> 01:14:50,800
And when you do sharechocolate with the world,

1248
01:14:51,842 --> 01:14:55,638
oh, I'll be right there beside ya.

1249
01:14:59,100 --> 01:15:01,227
Terrible shame, what happened here.

1250
01:15:03,771 --> 01:15:04,897
Take it you're responsible?

1251
01:15:04,981 --> 01:15:08,025
Us? Oh, no. Well, not personally.

1252
01:15:08,109 --> 01:15:13,322
We may have encouraged Mrs. Scrubittto enhance your creations.

1253
01:15:13,406 --> 01:15:15,199
We paid her to poison them.

1254
01:15:15,282 --> 01:15:17,159
- Yes, thank you, Gerald.- You're welcome.

1255
01:15:18,160 --> 01:15:20,788
So why have you come? To gloat?

1256
01:15:21,038 --> 01:15:22,331
Oh, no, Mr. Wonka,

1257
01:15:22,415 --> 01:15:24,215
I don't waste my timewith that sort of thing.

1258
01:15:24,542 --> 01:15:27,044
We've come to offer you a deal.

1259
01:15:27,920 --> 01:15:32,216
This is the precise amountyou owe Mrs. Scrubitt.

1260
01:15:33,467 --> 01:15:35,761
This is for the number cruncher,

1261
01:15:36,679 --> 01:15:37,930
the plumber,

1262
01:15:38,014 --> 01:15:40,141
the telephonist,

1263
01:15:40,224 --> 01:15:43,269
the so-called funny-man,

1264
01:15:43,936 --> 01:15:44,979
and this...

1265
01:15:47,148 --> 01:15:48,691
is for the girl.

1266
01:15:48,774 --> 01:15:50,609
Now, we put in a bit extra for her.

1267
01:15:50,693 --> 01:15:53,821
So that she can get a placeto live, clothes, toys...

1268
01:15:55,156 --> 01:15:56,407
books.

1269
01:15:57,908 --> 01:15:59,452
Oh, yes, Mr. Wonka.

1270
01:16:00,202 --> 01:16:04,206
You could change her life,change all their lives.

1271
01:16:06,208 --> 01:16:07,460
And what would I have to do?

1272
01:16:08,335 --> 01:16:09,378
Leave town.

1273
01:16:10,254 --> 01:16:11,255
Oh, and, um,

1274
01:16:12,715 --> 01:16:15,259
never make chocolate again.

1275
01:16:16,260 --> 01:16:18,679
There's a boat sailing at midnight.

1276
01:16:18,763 --> 01:16:22,725
And for their sake, as much asyour own, I hope you're on board.

1277
01:16:47,750 --> 01:16:50,252
- Checking out, are we?- Yeah.

1278
01:17:17,905 --> 01:17:19,323
Ah, Mr. Wonka.

1279
01:17:19,907 --> 01:17:21,784
Your ticket. Uh, one-way.

1280
01:17:22,701 --> 01:17:23,953
To the North Pole.

1281
01:17:24,453 --> 01:17:26,330
It's premium economy.

1282
01:17:26,413 --> 01:17:28,082
Yeah, it's basically economy.

1283
01:17:28,165 --> 01:17:29,855
I mean, yeah,you get a little more legroom.

1284
01:17:29,875 --> 01:17:31,335
A complimentary packet of peanuts.

1285
01:17:31,418 --> 01:17:32,503
Is it worth the extra?

1286
01:17:33,003 --> 01:17:36,340
I don't know. But these guys...

1287
01:17:36,423 --> 01:17:37,925
We don't need to go into details.

1288
01:17:38,008 --> 01:17:39,135
Goodbye,

1289
01:17:40,094 --> 01:17:41,220
Mr. Wonka.

1290
01:17:59,029 --> 01:18:00,030
Thank you.

1291
01:18:50,122 --> 01:18:51,457
So glad you're here.

1292
01:18:51,540 --> 01:18:54,168
Oh, I'm not going to let youout of my sight, Willy Wonka.

1293
01:18:54,251 --> 01:18:55,794
Not till you've paid your debt.

1294
01:18:55,878 --> 01:18:59,048
But I bring glad tidings on that score.

1295
01:18:59,131 --> 01:19:00,132
What's that?

1296
01:19:00,216 --> 01:19:01,884
I've been doing my sums.

1297
01:19:02,301 --> 01:19:04,470
One more jar, and we're even.

1298
01:19:04,553 --> 01:19:07,848
Or, if you prefer,I will accept half a jar

1299
01:19:07,932 --> 01:19:09,850
of those rather amusing Hoverchocs.

1300
01:19:09,934 --> 01:19:11,518
- You're outta luck.

1301
01:19:11,936 --> 01:19:13,687
I don't make chocolate anymore.

1302
01:19:13,771 --> 01:19:14,835
Oh, dear, please don't tell me

1303
01:19:14,855 --> 01:19:16,879
you're going to go throughwith this ridiculous deal.

1304
01:19:16,899 --> 01:19:19,276
I have to. For Noodle.

1305
01:19:20,110 --> 01:19:21,779
I promised her a better life.

1306
01:19:22,863 --> 01:19:24,156
I pinkie promised.

1307
01:19:24,240 --> 01:19:25,824
You should stand up to those bullies.

1308
01:19:25,908 --> 01:19:27,326
Give 'em the old one-two.

1309
01:19:27,409 --> 01:19:29,119
That's what an Oompa Loompa would do.

1310
01:19:32,081 --> 01:19:33,374
But if you are determined

1311
01:19:33,457 --> 01:19:35,709
to just sit therefeeling sorry for yourself,

1312
01:19:35,793 --> 01:19:37,211
I am going flat.

1313
01:19:37,628 --> 01:19:38,712
Good night, sir.

1314
01:19:48,013 --> 01:19:49,014
Huh.

1315
01:19:52,268 --> 01:19:54,395
What is it?

1316
01:19:54,937 --> 01:19:55,938
No, nothing.

1317
01:19:56,021 --> 01:19:58,857
Well, it's obviously somethingbecause you said, "Huh."

1318
01:19:58,941 --> 01:20:01,068
I'm sorry. Forget it.

1319
01:20:02,528 --> 01:20:05,072
- Very well.

1320
01:20:09,576 --> 01:20:10,619
Huh.

1321
01:20:10,703 --> 01:20:11,829
- Oh, you did it again.

1322
01:20:11,912 --> 01:20:14,812
Tell me what it is, or I shall poke youquite viciously with a cocktail stick.

1323
01:20:14,832 --> 01:20:17,084
Look. Where Slugworth shook my hand.

1324
01:20:17,167 --> 01:20:19,169
His ring left a mark. See?

1325
01:20:19,253 --> 01:20:21,171
It's an "A," surrounded by "S"s.

1326
01:20:21,255 --> 01:20:23,632
So what? His name is Arthur Slugworth.

1327
01:20:23,716 --> 01:20:25,384
It's probably a family ring.

1328
01:20:25,467 --> 01:20:27,052
Yes, but Noodle has one just like it.

1329
01:20:27,136 --> 01:20:28,137
- Noodle?- Uh-huh.

1330
01:20:28,679 --> 01:20:32,099
Why would Noodle the orphanhave a Slugworth family ring?

1331
01:20:32,683 --> 01:20:34,243
There's only one reason I can think of.

1332
01:20:34,476 --> 01:20:35,644
Which is?

1333
01:20:35,728 --> 01:20:37,584
And if I'm correct,Noodle could be in grave danger.

1334
01:20:37,604 --> 01:20:41,525
Well, come on, Wonka. Spit it out.Produce your owl pellet of wisdom.

1335
01:20:41,608 --> 01:20:43,110
There's no time. I gotta get back.

1336
01:20:43,193 --> 01:20:45,029
- Captain!- Wonka?

1337
01:20:45,112 --> 01:20:46,155
Come back here.

1338
01:20:46,238 --> 01:20:48,365
Wonka! I demand an explanation.

1339
01:20:48,449 --> 01:20:49,450
Captain?

1340
01:20:51,327 --> 01:20:54,538
On second thoughts,the explanation can wait.

1341
01:20:55,164 --> 01:20:56,206
Good day to you.

1342
01:21:05,382 --> 01:21:09,511
Well, gentlemen,one dead chocolatier, as requested.

1343
01:21:11,305 --> 01:21:12,348
Miss Bon-Bon?

1344
01:21:12,431 --> 01:21:13,682
Yes, Mr. Slugworth?

1345
01:21:14,183 --> 01:21:15,601
Give the chief his chocolate.

1346
01:21:24,234 --> 01:21:25,361
My, my.

1347
01:21:26,028 --> 01:21:28,655
What a lot o' long faces this morning.

1348
01:21:28,739 --> 01:21:31,533
It's almost as though you lothad a sneaky little scheme

1349
01:21:31,617 --> 01:21:33,369
to try and wriggle outof your contracts.

1350
01:21:33,452 --> 01:21:37,039
- Which spectacularly misfired.

1351
01:21:37,122 --> 01:21:40,376
But I've got some good newsfor you lot, not that you deserve it.

1352
01:21:40,459 --> 01:21:44,088
Your friend, Mr. Wonka,done a deal with Mr. Slugworth.

1353
01:21:44,171 --> 01:21:45,214
What?

1354
01:21:45,297 --> 01:21:48,759
Gave up on his dreamto settle your accounts.

1355
01:21:49,843 --> 01:21:51,345
- Mr. Crunch.- Present.

1356
01:21:55,265 --> 01:21:56,392
You're free to go.

1357
01:21:57,851 --> 01:21:58,936
Scram, bookworm.

1358
01:21:59,269 --> 01:22:00,604
- Bell.- Hello.

1359
01:22:00,687 --> 01:22:01,814
Sling yer hook.

1360
01:22:01,897 --> 01:22:02,898
Benz.

1361
01:22:03,357 --> 01:22:05,067
You ain't gotta tell me twice.

1362
01:22:05,150 --> 01:22:06,485
Chuckles worth.

1363
01:22:06,568 --> 01:22:08,987
You've beena terrible audience. Good night!

1364
01:22:09,071 --> 01:22:10,928
Yeah, well, you ain't beenmuch of a comedian, mate.

1365
01:22:10,948 --> 01:22:12,741
- I know.- Hey, Larry.

1366
01:22:13,325 --> 01:22:15,411
Keep going. You've got something.

1367
01:22:16,036 --> 01:22:17,329
You scare me.

1368
01:22:17,413 --> 01:22:20,374
And finally, Noodle.

1369
01:22:20,457 --> 01:22:22,334
Biggest pile o' the lot.

1370
01:22:23,127 --> 01:22:24,962
But this isn't to pay your bill.

1371
01:22:25,671 --> 01:22:27,631
This is to keep you here.

1372
01:22:28,006 --> 01:22:29,007
- What do you mean?

1373
01:22:30,175 --> 01:22:31,760
My friend, Mr. Slugworth,

1374
01:22:31,844 --> 01:22:33,804
doesn't thinknasty little urchins like you

1375
01:22:33,887 --> 01:22:36,640
should be out on the streets,lowering the tone.

1376
01:22:36,723 --> 01:22:38,809
So, he gave me this money

1377
01:22:38,892 --> 01:22:42,396
to keep you downin the Wash House for good.

1378
01:22:42,479 --> 01:22:44,565
And I'm only too happy to oblige.

1379
01:22:45,232 --> 01:22:46,275
- I hate you!- Hey!

1380
01:22:46,358 --> 01:22:47,860
- Hey, hey, hey.

1381
01:22:47,943 --> 01:22:49,778
Look at her go, Lord Bleachowitz.

1382
01:22:49,862 --> 01:22:51,613
- Lord Bleachowitz?

1383
01:22:51,697 --> 01:22:53,365
You don't still thinkhe's a lord, do you?

1384
01:22:53,449 --> 01:22:54,450
What?

1385
01:22:54,533 --> 01:22:56,410
We made it up, you stupid old hag.

1386
01:22:57,035 --> 01:22:58,662
She's... She's lying.

1387
01:22:58,745 --> 01:23:01,165
Right, that's it,you horrible little brat.

1388
01:23:01,248 --> 01:23:03,876
You're goin' in the coop, my girl.

1389
01:23:03,959 --> 01:23:09,756
And you! Take them dungarees off,you... you peasant.

1390
01:23:09,840 --> 01:23:11,300
But Puffy-wuffy.

1391
01:23:11,758 --> 01:23:13,093
I wuv you.

1392
01:23:40,078 --> 01:23:41,163
Hello, Noodle.

1393
01:23:41,705 --> 01:23:44,583
Willy. I thought you'd gone.

1394
01:23:45,167 --> 01:23:46,293
I did.

1395
01:23:46,376 --> 01:23:48,003
Slugworth promised you a better life,

1396
01:23:48,086 --> 01:23:50,339
but he didn't exactlykeep his side of the bargain.

1397
01:23:50,672 --> 01:23:52,424
So I came back. We all did.

1398
01:23:52,508 --> 01:23:53,884
- Hey, Noodle.- How do?

1399
01:23:53,967 --> 01:23:55,511
- Hey.- Surprise!

1400
01:23:55,594 --> 01:23:57,179
He wants me locked up forever.

1401
01:23:57,262 --> 01:23:58,764
Yeah, well, that figures.

1402
01:23:58,847 --> 01:24:01,099
Why? What's he got against me?

1403
01:24:01,183 --> 01:24:02,935
I don't know, Noodle. Not for sure.

1404
01:24:03,018 --> 01:24:04,061
All I know for certain

1405
01:24:04,144 --> 01:24:06,563
is that you won't be safeuntil Slugworth is behind bars.

1406
01:24:08,482 --> 01:24:11,318
And how, exactly,is that supposed to happen?

1407
01:24:11,401 --> 01:24:14,613
Abacus. You said the Cartel keepa record of all their dirty deeds.

1408
01:24:14,696 --> 01:24:16,240
In the green ledger, yes.

1409
01:24:16,323 --> 01:24:17,387
So if we can get hold o' that,

1410
01:24:17,407 --> 01:24:19,207
we can prove thatthey poisoned our chocolate.

1411
01:24:19,243 --> 01:24:21,745
Scrubitt and Bleacher wouldgo to jail, and we'll all be free.

1412
01:24:21,828 --> 01:24:25,874
Uh, yes, but may I remind you,they keep that ledger in a vault.

1413
01:24:25,958 --> 01:24:27,459
Guarded by a corrupt cleric.

1414
01:24:27,543 --> 01:24:29,836
And 500 chocoholic monks.

1415
01:24:29,920 --> 01:24:32,256
- Mmm-hmm.- That's all true.

1416
01:24:32,339 --> 01:24:34,841
But I went for a long,cold swim this morning.

1417
01:24:34,925 --> 01:24:38,220
Cold water is very good for the brain,stimulates the neural pathways.

1418
01:24:38,303 --> 01:24:39,930
And after just four miles,it came to me.

1419
01:24:40,347 --> 01:24:42,015
How an ingenious orphan,

1420
01:24:42,099 --> 01:24:43,225
an accountant, a plumber,

1421
01:24:43,308 --> 01:24:45,269
a telephone exchange operator,

1422
01:24:45,352 --> 01:24:46,937
and a man who can speak underwater,

1423
01:24:47,020 --> 01:24:50,190
could combine those talentsand pull off the heist of the century.

1424
01:24:50,274 --> 01:24:53,068
But even if we do getour hands on that ledger,

1425
01:24:53,151 --> 01:24:55,904
the Cartel will simply bribetheir way out of trouble.

1426
01:24:55,988 --> 01:24:58,156
- It's what they do.

1427
01:24:58,240 --> 01:24:59,866
The greedy beat the needy, Willy.

1428
01:25:00,450 --> 01:25:01,827
It's just the way of the world.

1429
01:25:01,910 --> 01:25:02,910
You're right, Noodle.

1430
01:25:03,495 --> 01:25:05,394
I guess that's whythere's one other thing to do.

1431
01:25:05,414 --> 01:25:07,749
- What's that?- Change the world.

1432
01:25:11,169 --> 01:25:12,170
Whoa!

1433
01:25:13,672 --> 01:25:14,756
Where do we start?

1434
01:25:27,477 --> 01:25:28,478
'Scuse me, sir.

1435
01:25:29,187 --> 01:25:31,940
Could you spare a pieceof chocolate for a starvin' orphan?

1436
01:25:32,024 --> 01:25:35,402
I'm sorry, my child.I don't have any on me.

1437
01:25:35,485 --> 01:25:36,945
Oh.

1438
01:25:38,822 --> 01:25:40,449
Then have some acacia mints.

1439
01:25:41,366 --> 01:25:42,367
Yes!

1440
01:25:45,203 --> 01:25:48,040
"To Basil Bond, employee of the week."

1441
01:25:48,123 --> 01:25:49,249
Oh, that's lovely...

1442
01:26:01,219 --> 01:26:03,180
Everything all right back there?

1443
01:26:03,263 --> 01:26:05,515
Everything's fine. Isn't it, Abigail?

1444
01:26:07,601 --> 01:26:09,394
Tell her she might want to duck.

1445
01:26:09,478 --> 01:26:11,146
Tell her she might wanna what?

1446
01:26:11,229 --> 01:26:12,230
Duck!

1447
01:26:15,901 --> 01:26:17,027
Good morning, brethren.

1448
01:26:17,110 --> 01:26:18,487
Good morning, Father.

1449
01:26:18,570 --> 01:26:19,780
Now, as you all know,

1450
01:26:19,863 --> 01:26:23,158
it's Baron von Schmeichelhammer'sfuneral today.

1451
01:26:23,241 --> 01:26:28,997
- And his widow's a bit of a pious type.- Ugh!

1452
01:26:29,373 --> 01:26:32,959
So, I don't want to see anyoneeating chocolate during the service.

1453
01:26:33,043 --> 01:26:34,795
Yes, Father.

1454
01:26:34,878 --> 01:26:38,298
We all know that one day,we shall be judged for our sins,

1455
01:26:38,382 --> 01:26:41,385
but it's not going to be today.

1456
01:26:41,468 --> 01:26:43,178
Amen.

1457
01:26:57,275 --> 01:26:58,568
There, there.

1458
01:26:58,985 --> 01:27:00,779
Nice giraffe.

1459
01:27:01,238 --> 01:27:03,573
Run! Everybody out!

1460
01:27:04,574 --> 01:27:05,617
Save yourselves!

1461
01:27:07,869 --> 01:27:08,870
Judgment has come!

1462
01:27:09,996 --> 01:27:10,997
Run off! Quickly!

1463
01:27:11,081 --> 01:27:12,708
In a most unexpected form.

1464
01:27:14,084 --> 01:27:15,210
Run away!

1465
01:27:17,504 --> 01:27:19,339
What have I done to deserve this?

1466
01:27:19,881 --> 01:27:21,425
You know what you've done, Julius.

1467
01:27:21,508 --> 01:27:23,885
You've sold your soulfor 30 pieces of chocolate.

1468
01:27:27,639 --> 01:27:29,975
Hello, operator.How may I direct your call?

1469
01:27:30,058 --> 01:27:32,894
I need the Zoo.It's an emergency.

1470
01:27:32,978 --> 01:27:36,106
Putting you throughto the Escaped Animal Department now.

1471
01:27:37,649 --> 01:27:38,692
Hello, Zoo.

1472
01:27:42,279 --> 01:27:44,489
Quiet down, you animals.

1473
01:27:44,573 --> 01:27:45,907
You too, octopus.

1474
01:27:45,991 --> 01:27:46,992
There's a giraffe.

1475
01:27:47,075 --> 01:27:49,828
What? Oh, yeah, I thinkwe did lose a giraffe.

1476
01:27:49,911 --> 01:27:51,538
- Well, could you come and get it?

1477
01:27:51,621 --> 01:27:54,166
Okay, jeez. I'll send the guys around.

1478
01:28:06,303 --> 01:28:07,637
Oh, forgive me!

1479
01:28:08,847 --> 01:28:10,182
I'm a sinner!

1480
01:28:10,265 --> 01:28:14,394
A weak and wicked chocoholic!

1481
01:28:23,695 --> 01:28:25,447
Good morning, everyone.

1482
01:28:25,530 --> 01:28:27,657
- Welcome to St. Benedict's.

1483
01:28:28,241 --> 01:28:30,911
Baroness, I'm so sorry for your loss.

1484
01:28:32,037 --> 01:28:36,249
We're just havinga few technical difficulties, um,

1485
01:28:36,333 --> 01:28:39,753
So you might want to popthe late baron down for a minute.

1486
01:28:41,421 --> 01:28:42,547
Ah, the cavalry.

1487
01:28:42,839 --> 01:28:44,966
Are you the clericwho called about a giraffe?

1488
01:28:51,598 --> 01:28:52,766
All clear.

1489
01:29:19,084 --> 01:29:21,378
Huh. "Thanks for all your hard work.

1490
01:29:21,711 --> 01:29:23,797
Father Julius and the Chocolate Cartel."

1491
01:29:24,631 --> 01:29:26,091
Oh, that's nice.

1492
01:29:27,008 --> 01:29:28,009
Mmm.

1493
01:29:28,093 --> 01:29:29,594
- Here we are, Father.

1494
01:29:29,678 --> 01:29:31,930
- One giraffe.

1495
01:29:32,013 --> 01:29:33,557
- Marvelous.- Thank you, thank you.

1496
01:29:33,640 --> 01:29:35,141
Stand back, please. Stand back.

1497
01:29:35,225 --> 01:29:38,728
Have I got a sweet tooth? Pow! I do

1498
01:29:42,524 --> 01:29:43,525
Wow.

1499
01:29:43,608 --> 01:29:44,673
Have I got a sweet tooth...

1500
01:29:44,693 --> 01:29:45,902
She can really move.

1501
01:29:45,986 --> 01:29:48,488
I could've been happy,but I threw a pearl away.

1502
01:29:49,197 --> 01:29:51,199
I'll give him a call. No, I can't.

1503
01:29:51,283 --> 01:29:52,742
I will give him a call, actually.

1504
01:29:58,999 --> 01:30:00,000
Hello?

1505
01:30:00,083 --> 01:30:01,918
Basil? It's Gwennie.

1506
01:30:02,335 --> 01:30:03,336
You were right.

1507
01:30:03,420 --> 01:30:04,504
What are the chances?

1508
01:30:04,588 --> 01:30:08,550
Those days in chemistry classwere the happiest of my life.

1509
01:30:28,236 --> 01:30:29,321
Cool.

1510
01:30:37,162 --> 01:30:38,413
Sorry about this, sir.

1511
01:30:38,496 --> 01:30:40,206
The seafood truck spilled its load.

1512
01:30:40,290 --> 01:30:42,459
There's so many blastedflamingos about these days.

1513
01:30:42,542 --> 01:30:44,628
Well, hurry it along now, will you?

1514
01:30:44,711 --> 01:30:46,755
The town squarewas closed this morning

1515
01:30:46,838 --> 01:30:49,758
after a bizarre incidentat the city cathedral,

1516
01:30:49,841 --> 01:30:52,886
delaying the funeralof noted philanthropist

1517
01:30:52,969 --> 01:30:55,055
Baron von Schmeichelhammer.

1518
01:30:55,472 --> 01:30:56,890
In nomine Patris,

1519
01:30:56,973 --> 01:30:59,935
et Filii, et Spiritus Sancti.

1520
01:31:00,602 --> 01:31:01,603
Amen.

1521
01:31:06,900 --> 01:31:08,818
Sorry, I'd best get that.

1522
01:31:10,862 --> 01:31:12,405
- Hello, Pulpit.- Father.

1523
01:31:12,489 --> 01:31:13,907
Everything all right there?

1524
01:31:13,990 --> 01:31:15,241
Oh, yes, Mr. Slugworth.

1525
01:31:15,533 --> 01:31:16,826
All tickety-boo.

1526
01:31:17,285 --> 01:31:18,787
At least it is now.

1527
01:31:18,870 --> 01:31:20,580
- What do you mean by that?

1528
01:31:20,664 --> 01:31:22,415
Oh, we had a giraffe in here earlier.

1529
01:31:22,499 --> 01:31:24,105
Had to clear the whole placefor about 20 minutes,

1530
01:31:24,125 --> 01:31:25,710
but everything's back to normal.

1531
01:31:28,129 --> 01:31:29,130
Hello?

1532
01:31:29,214 --> 01:31:31,633
Damn the flamingos, Donovan! Floor it!

1533
01:31:31,716 --> 01:31:32,717
Yes, sir!

1534
01:31:36,096 --> 01:31:37,305
Idiot!

1535
01:31:41,101 --> 01:31:42,686
- Anything?- Nothing.

1536
01:31:43,144 --> 01:31:44,145
Well, keep looking.

1537
01:31:44,229 --> 01:31:45,313
It's not in here, Willy.

1538
01:31:45,397 --> 01:31:46,544
But Abacus said that it was here.

1539
01:31:46,564 --> 01:31:47,671
Abacus has been in the Wash House

1540
01:31:47,691 --> 01:31:49,609
for the past four years.

1541
01:31:49,693 --> 01:31:51,778
Maybe all the scrubbinghas gone to his head.

1542
01:31:51,861 --> 01:31:54,541
'Cause all that's down hereis just a bunch of stupid old chocolate.

1543
01:32:10,088 --> 01:32:11,256
Willy, look!

1544
01:32:19,347 --> 01:32:20,598
We did it, Noodle.

1545
01:32:21,141 --> 01:32:22,517
- We got 'em.

1546
01:32:24,728 --> 01:32:27,147
Naughty, naughty, Mr. Wonka.

1547
01:32:27,230 --> 01:32:30,066
You've caused us quite a bit of trouble.

1548
01:32:30,150 --> 01:32:32,027
You and your urchin.

1549
01:32:32,110 --> 01:32:34,821
Yeah, but she's not just an urchin,is she, Mr. Slugworth?

1550
01:32:36,656 --> 01:32:37,991
You're family.

1551
01:32:38,742 --> 01:32:39,743
What?

1552
01:32:40,118 --> 01:32:41,661
What are you talking about, Willy?

1553
01:32:43,455 --> 01:32:44,831
You know that ring, Noodle?

1554
01:32:45,373 --> 01:32:46,791
The one your parents gave you?

1555
01:32:47,459 --> 01:32:48,918
Mr. Slugworth has one just like it.

1556
01:32:49,669 --> 01:32:51,212
Don't you, Mr. Slugworth?

1557
01:32:51,921 --> 01:32:53,965
As a matter of fact, I do.

1558
01:32:54,632 --> 01:32:58,970
That belonged to my brother. Zebedee.

1559
01:32:59,554 --> 01:33:00,555
Was he my father?

1560
01:33:01,056 --> 01:33:02,599
A hopeless romantic is what he was.

1561
01:33:03,725 --> 01:33:06,102
Fell in love witha common little bookworm,

1562
01:33:06,186 --> 01:33:07,687
died before they could marry.

1563
01:33:08,354 --> 01:33:12,025
Leaving me sole heirto the family fortune.

1564
01:33:13,026 --> 01:33:14,903
Or so I thought.

1565
01:33:15,445 --> 01:33:19,282
But nine months later,your mother turned up on my doorstep,

1566
01:33:19,908 --> 01:33:22,994
begging me to get a doctorfor her sick little newborn.

1567
01:33:24,037 --> 01:33:25,330
I said I would help.

1568
01:33:25,872 --> 01:33:28,041
But you didn't. Did you?

1569
01:33:28,124 --> 01:33:29,250
Oh, no.

1570
01:33:29,709 --> 01:33:31,878
Instead, you put medown a laundry chute.

1571
01:33:31,961 --> 01:33:33,088
Bye-bye, baby.

1572
01:33:33,880 --> 01:33:35,423
Mrs. Scrubitt found me.

1573
01:33:35,965 --> 01:33:37,467
She saw the ring.

1574
01:33:37,550 --> 01:33:39,803
Thought it was an "N, "and called me Noodle.

1575
01:33:40,512 --> 01:33:41,638
But it wasn't.

1576
01:33:41,721 --> 01:33:44,057
It was "Z." For Zebedee.

1577
01:33:44,140 --> 01:33:45,141
Well, quite.

1578
01:33:45,642 --> 01:33:47,769
When your mother returned,I told her you had died.

1579
01:33:47,852 --> 01:33:48,937
Oh, no!

1580
01:33:49,020 --> 01:33:50,260
She was heartbroken, of course.

1581
01:33:50,313 --> 01:33:51,993
But, uh, I gave hera handful of sovereigns

1582
01:33:52,023 --> 01:33:54,067
and had her escorted from my property.

1583
01:33:56,027 --> 01:33:57,529
What was her name?

1584
01:33:58,196 --> 01:33:59,197
Eh?

1585
01:33:59,614 --> 01:34:01,658
My mom. What was her name?

1586
01:34:02,867 --> 01:34:03,868
Ooh.

1587
01:34:04,452 --> 01:34:05,662
Let me see. Um...

1588
01:34:07,288 --> 01:34:09,249
No, I don't think I could remember that.

1589
01:34:10,083 --> 01:34:12,669
Sorry. But you have to understand,

1590
01:34:12,752 --> 01:34:14,838
she was very poor.

1591
01:34:14,921 --> 01:34:16,548
- Sorry, Felix.

1592
01:34:17,173 --> 01:34:18,216
Her name was Dorothy.

1593
01:34:19,342 --> 01:34:21,136
Dorothy Smith. It says so right here.

1594
01:34:22,095 --> 01:34:23,346
Dorothy?

1595
01:34:23,429 --> 01:34:24,556
Well, what do you know?

1596
01:34:25,098 --> 01:34:27,183
I guess you did teach meto read after all.

1597
01:34:28,393 --> 01:34:30,061
Well, this is all very touching,

1598
01:34:30,145 --> 01:34:31,729
but back to business.

1599
01:34:31,813 --> 01:34:33,815
We'll take that, thank you.

1600
01:34:33,898 --> 01:34:35,630
How much chocolatedo you have at your factory,

1601
01:34:35,650 --> 01:34:36,651
Mr. Fickelgruber?

1602
01:34:36,734 --> 01:34:38,820
Oh, about 80,000 gallons.

1603
01:34:38,903 --> 01:34:40,864
- Prodnose?

1604
01:34:40,947 --> 01:34:41,990
Seventy-five?

1605
01:34:42,073 --> 01:34:43,408
And I've got 150.

1606
01:34:44,409 --> 01:34:45,702
That should be enough.

1607
01:34:45,994 --> 01:34:46,995
For what?

1608
01:34:47,912 --> 01:34:50,623
Death by chocolate.

1609
01:35:08,892 --> 01:35:10,393
On you go.

1610
01:35:28,703 --> 01:35:29,913
Uh, gentlemen.

1611
01:35:31,456 --> 01:35:32,749
Considering the situation,

1612
01:35:32,832 --> 01:35:35,210
I wondered if you'd doa good deed on my behalf.

1613
01:35:35,293 --> 01:35:36,377
A what?

1614
01:35:36,461 --> 01:35:37,712
"A good deed."

1615
01:35:37,795 --> 01:35:39,881
It's a sort of pointless actof selflessness...

1616
01:35:39,964 --> 01:35:44,052
Yes, of course, Mr. Wonka.What would you like us to do?

1617
01:35:44,135 --> 01:35:46,512
I was wonderingif you could give this to someone.

1618
01:35:47,805 --> 01:35:49,098
Only if you happen to see him.

1619
01:35:49,515 --> 01:35:50,516
And who is it?

1620
01:35:50,600 --> 01:35:53,019
- A little orange man.- Eh?

1621
01:35:53,102 --> 01:35:54,562
A little orange man.

1622
01:35:54,646 --> 01:35:57,815
About eight inches high,with orange skin and bright green hair.

1623
01:35:57,899 --> 01:36:00,276
I owe him a jar of chocolates,you see. And, well,

1624
01:36:01,236 --> 01:36:03,821
I think these might bethe best I ever made.

1625
01:36:03,905 --> 01:36:07,242
Well, in that case,I'll make sure he gets them personally.

1626
01:36:12,163 --> 01:36:13,539
Farewell, Mr. Wonka.

1627
01:36:14,916 --> 01:36:15,916
Urchin.

1628
01:36:55,790 --> 01:36:57,583
What are we gonna do, Willy?

1629
01:36:57,667 --> 01:37:00,461
I don't know, Noodle.I'll think of something.

1630
01:37:07,468 --> 01:37:09,595
Best chocolate he ever made, eh?

1631
01:37:11,889 --> 01:37:13,641
- Whoo-hoo.- Oh!

1632
01:37:15,059 --> 01:37:16,060
I got it!

1633
01:37:16,144 --> 01:37:17,704
What is it? Did you think of something?

1634
01:37:17,729 --> 01:37:19,022
Yes, I did.

1635
01:37:19,105 --> 01:37:20,745
If we're gonna drownin chocolate, Noodle,

1636
01:37:20,815 --> 01:37:23,318
and let's face it,we're gonna drown in chocolate,

1637
01:37:23,401 --> 01:37:24,902
then it's gonna be Wonka chocolate.

1638
01:37:24,986 --> 01:37:27,989
We're not gonna drown, Willy.Look, there's a light.

1639
01:37:28,072 --> 01:37:29,907
We'll let the chocolate lift us up,

1640
01:37:29,991 --> 01:37:31,326
we'll bang on the glass,

1641
01:37:31,409 --> 01:37:33,036
and pray somebody hears us.

1642
01:37:33,703 --> 01:37:35,079
That's a much better idea.

1643
01:37:37,999 --> 01:37:38,999
Ah, gentlemen.

1644
01:37:39,042 --> 01:37:41,336
It was a bitof a close shave this morning,

1645
01:37:41,419 --> 01:37:46,174
and I was wondering if perhapswe could rethink our arrangement. Or...

1646
01:37:48,343 --> 01:37:52,013
Or... just leave things as they are.

1647
01:37:52,096 --> 01:37:53,097
Father.

1648
01:37:54,640 --> 01:37:56,517
Well, Wonka might beas nutty as a fruitcake,

1649
01:37:56,601 --> 01:37:58,353
but he sure knew how to make chocolate.

1650
01:37:58,436 --> 01:37:59,645
- Mmm.- But do you think

1651
01:37:59,729 --> 01:38:01,856
we should have saved somefor the Little Orange Man?

1652
01:38:01,939 --> 01:38:03,441
Tell me you're joking.

1653
01:38:03,524 --> 01:38:06,861
Uh, yes. Yes, I am. Sorry, why am I?

1654
01:38:06,944 --> 01:38:08,112
Because there's no such thing

1655
01:38:08,196 --> 01:38:10,531
as a little orange man, ya nincompoop.

1656
01:38:13,785 --> 01:38:15,453
- Help!- Help!

1657
01:38:15,536 --> 01:38:16,913
Somebody help, please!

1658
01:38:16,996 --> 01:38:19,123
- Please help!- Help!

1659
01:38:19,207 --> 01:38:21,501
Look. Look, somebody's coming. Look.

1660
01:38:21,584 --> 01:38:23,169
Willy, we're saved!

1661
01:38:36,516 --> 01:38:38,768
- I'm sorry, Noodle.- Don't be.

1662
01:38:39,727 --> 01:38:41,229
You found my family.

1663
01:38:42,021 --> 01:38:43,981
A mom who loved me.

1664
01:38:44,690 --> 01:38:46,526
That's all I ever wanted.

1665
01:38:48,736 --> 01:38:49,946
Deep breath now.

1666
01:39:04,335 --> 01:39:07,130
Mmm! Exquisite.

1667
01:39:07,922 --> 01:39:10,091
You mustn't let yourselfget so worked up.

1668
01:39:10,591 --> 01:39:12,885
It's just a bit of chocolate.

1669
01:39:12,969 --> 01:39:14,429
- Correction.

1670
01:39:14,512 --> 01:39:17,682
It was actually my chocolate.

1671
01:39:24,981 --> 01:39:27,900
You have madea very grave error, gentlemen.

1672
01:39:28,443 --> 01:39:30,194
You steal from an Oompa Loompa,

1673
01:39:30,278 --> 01:39:32,655
we take back a thousandfold.

1674
01:39:40,663 --> 01:39:41,956
What's going on, Willy?

1675
01:39:42,748 --> 01:39:44,167
It's draining, Noodle.

1676
01:39:44,959 --> 01:39:46,419
We've been saved!

1677
01:39:46,961 --> 01:39:49,046
- By who?- I don't know.

1678
01:39:50,256 --> 01:39:52,425
By the Little Orange Man!

1679
01:39:52,508 --> 01:39:53,509
- Look.- Wh...

1680
01:39:53,593 --> 01:39:55,386
The Little Orange Man!

1681
01:39:55,928 --> 01:39:58,347
Thank you, Little Orange Man!Thank you!

1682
01:40:21,621 --> 01:40:25,458
Gentlemen. Thank goodnessyou're okay. I came as fast as I could.

1683
01:40:34,217 --> 01:40:36,052
Whew! Car shrunk.

1684
01:40:36,135 --> 01:40:37,136
I'm sure it did.

1685
01:40:37,220 --> 01:40:38,971
And you've nothingto worry about, Chief.

1686
01:40:39,055 --> 01:40:40,139
All under control.

1687
01:40:40,223 --> 01:40:41,787
A couple of thieves broke in,but I'm afraid

1688
01:40:41,807 --> 01:40:44,810
they met with a little... accident.

1689
01:40:44,894 --> 01:40:47,355
In which they died.

1690
01:40:48,856 --> 01:40:50,296
That's actually rather good, Gerald.

1691
01:40:50,316 --> 01:40:52,568
I wouldn't be SO sure about that.

1692
01:40:52,652 --> 01:40:54,452
Officer, would you kindlytake a look at this?

1693
01:40:54,487 --> 01:40:55,488
Wonka!

1694
01:40:55,571 --> 01:40:58,824
It details every single illegal paymentthese men have ever made.

1695
01:40:58,908 --> 01:41:00,243
Thousands of them.

1696
01:41:00,326 --> 01:41:02,995
Affable, don't listen to her. She's lyin'.

1697
01:41:03,079 --> 01:41:04,705
Well, of course she is.

1698
01:41:04,789 --> 01:41:07,625
She's not, sir. She's absolutely right.

1699
01:41:08,376 --> 01:41:09,377
It's incredible.

1700
01:41:10,127 --> 01:41:11,587
Oh. Well.

1701
01:41:11,671 --> 01:41:15,216
Then that sounds like a casefor the Chief of Police.

1702
01:41:15,299 --> 01:41:16,739
So you give it to me, Affable, I'll, uh...

1703
01:41:16,759 --> 01:41:17,879
I'll take it off your hands.

1704
01:41:17,927 --> 01:41:19,242
You know, save you the paperwork.

1705
01:41:19,262 --> 01:41:21,013
I can't do that, I'm afraid, sir.

1706
01:41:21,097 --> 01:41:22,473
Why's that?

1707
01:41:22,765 --> 01:41:24,350
Because your name is written down here.

1708
01:41:24,433 --> 01:41:25,434
Huh?

1709
01:41:25,518 --> 01:41:27,395
- A lot.- Gentlemen...

1710
01:41:27,478 --> 01:41:28,896
- You're under arrest.- Run.

1711
01:41:28,980 --> 01:41:30,127
We puttin' handcuffs on, here?

1712
01:41:30,147 --> 01:41:31,148
- That's okay, Noodle.

1713
01:41:31,232 --> 01:41:32,900
Give it one second.

1714
01:41:35,194 --> 01:41:36,445
What's happening?

1715
01:41:36,862 --> 01:41:38,281
Why are we airborne?

1716
01:41:38,364 --> 01:41:39,804
You didn't eat any of those chocolates,

1717
01:41:39,824 --> 01:41:41,826
- did you, Mr. Slugworth?- Why?

1718
01:41:41,909 --> 01:41:43,160
Because they're Hoverchocs.

1719
01:41:43,244 --> 01:41:46,038
Delayed action, but extra strong.

1720
01:41:46,122 --> 01:41:47,895
You think you're very clever,don't you, Wonka?

1721
01:41:47,915 --> 01:41:49,875
Well, there's a billionsovereigns of chocolate

1722
01:41:49,959 --> 01:41:51,085
beneath our feet.

1723
01:41:51,168 --> 01:41:52,420
We'll get the best lawyers,

1724
01:41:52,503 --> 01:41:54,797
bribe the judge,rig the jury if we have to.

1725
01:41:54,880 --> 01:41:56,507
We'll be fine.

1726
01:41:57,216 --> 01:41:58,801
I wish I'd thought of that.

1727
01:42:02,680 --> 01:42:03,973
Hey, Noodle!

1728
01:42:21,949 --> 01:42:23,034
What is that?

1729
01:42:23,117 --> 01:42:24,410
It's our chocolate!

1730
01:42:24,493 --> 01:42:26,245
All our chocolate!

1731
01:42:26,329 --> 01:42:27,538
We're ruined!

1732
01:42:27,622 --> 01:42:30,791
Hey, don't worry, gentlemen.You'll come down eventually.

1733
01:42:31,250 --> 01:42:33,669
Probably. I think.

1734
01:42:34,337 --> 01:42:35,713
But until then,

1735
01:42:36,422 --> 01:42:38,591
ladies and gentlemen,

1736
01:42:39,550 --> 01:42:43,054
- Willy Wonka and friends...

1737
01:42:43,137 --> 01:42:45,431
...Invite you to enjoy our chocolate.

1738
01:42:46,724 --> 01:42:48,809
- Yay! Magic Wonka!

1739
01:42:52,188 --> 01:42:53,189
Gwennie?

1740
01:42:53,898 --> 01:42:55,483
Basil!

1741
01:42:56,817 --> 01:42:59,445
What did I say, Abacus,I told you we could fix it all.

1742
01:43:17,296 --> 01:43:18,381
Your cup.

1743
01:43:19,298 --> 01:43:20,299
Thank you.

1744
01:43:20,383 --> 01:43:21,634
- There you are.- There you go.

1745
01:43:21,717 --> 01:43:22,718
- Careful, not too much.

1746
01:43:22,802 --> 01:43:23,803
Okay.

1747
01:45:02,359 --> 01:45:05,279
- Mmm.- Oh, thank you.

1748
01:45:05,362 --> 01:45:07,031
Thank you.

1749
01:45:07,114 --> 01:45:08,324
- Mmm.- Thank you.

1750
01:45:09,366 --> 01:45:10,951
- Mmm.- Oh.

1751
01:45:20,085 --> 01:45:21,128
Huh.

1752
01:45:24,965 --> 01:45:28,219
So... how does it feel, Willy?

1753
01:45:29,261 --> 01:45:30,805
Is it as good as you remember?

1754
01:45:32,348 --> 01:45:33,808
Every little bit.

1755
01:45:37,478 --> 01:45:38,938
I wish it could last forever.

1756
01:45:45,361 --> 01:45:46,570
I guess it's time.

1757
01:45:48,781 --> 01:45:49,865
Time for what?

1758
01:45:50,825 --> 01:45:53,185
Do you know how many peoplein this city are named D. Smith?

1759
01:45:53,702 --> 01:45:55,329
One hundred and six.

1760
01:45:56,247 --> 01:45:58,604
And luckily, you have a friendwho works at the telephone exchange,

1761
01:45:58,624 --> 01:46:02,044
and she spentthe entire afternoon ringing around.

1762
01:46:02,127 --> 01:46:03,212
And guess what?

1763
01:46:05,047 --> 01:46:06,131
We found her.

1764
01:46:07,258 --> 01:46:08,300
You found my mom?

1765
01:46:08,968 --> 01:46:10,553
She works in the library.

1766
01:46:12,096 --> 01:46:13,430
That's where she lives.

1767
01:46:15,558 --> 01:46:16,600
Come on, Noodle.

1768
01:47:53,155 --> 01:47:55,324
- Mom.

1769
01:47:57,785 --> 01:48:01,121
So goes a good deed in a weary world.

1770
01:48:01,205 --> 01:48:02,998
I was wondering if I'd see you again.

1771
01:48:03,374 --> 01:48:06,543
I'm not going anywhere, Willy Wonka,not until you've paid your debt.

1772
01:48:06,627 --> 01:48:08,379
Now, I know you tried.

1773
01:48:08,462 --> 01:48:10,839
Loompa law is very clearon this subject.

1774
01:48:10,923 --> 01:48:12,049
Until such time

1775
01:48:12,132 --> 01:48:14,468
as the chocolate isphysically in my hand...

1776
01:48:16,553 --> 01:48:18,347
Oh. Thank you.

1777
01:48:18,430 --> 01:48:20,891
Thank you. For saving my life.

1778
01:48:22,142 --> 01:48:24,478
Well, I supposethat concludes our business.

1779
01:48:24,561 --> 01:48:27,147
I will now returnto my beloved Loompaland.

1780
01:48:27,731 --> 01:48:31,610
Where the cocoa beans grow indisappointingly small numbers,

1781
01:48:31,694 --> 01:48:33,612
and my friends look down on me.

1782
01:48:33,696 --> 01:48:35,990
What? I thought they called you Lofty.

1783
01:48:36,073 --> 01:48:40,494
The truth is that I ama quarter-inch below average.

1784
01:48:40,995 --> 01:48:42,579
They call me Shorty-pants.

1785
01:48:42,663 --> 01:48:44,665
- But there it is.

1786
01:48:44,748 --> 01:48:46,125
Good day to you, sir.

1787
01:48:46,208 --> 01:48:47,626
Uh, it's a shame you have to go.

1788
01:48:48,585 --> 01:48:49,795
I said, good day.

1789
01:48:49,878 --> 01:48:51,755
If I'm gonna sharemy chocolate with the world,

1790
01:48:51,839 --> 01:48:53,112
I'm gonna need more than a shop.

1791
01:48:53,132 --> 01:48:54,174
I'm sure you will.

1792
01:48:54,258 --> 01:48:55,426
I'm gonna need a factory.

1793
01:48:55,509 --> 01:48:57,052
Yeah, well, good luck with that.

1794
01:48:57,136 --> 01:48:59,722
And someone to head upthe tasting department.

1795
01:48:59,805 --> 01:49:01,306
The tasting department?

1796
01:49:02,975 --> 01:49:03,976
All right.

1797
01:49:05,144 --> 01:49:06,145
- Where?

1798
01:49:10,315 --> 01:49:11,358
- It's a ruined castle.

1799
01:49:18,365 --> 01:49:19,658
Frankly, I rather doubt it.

1800
01:49:36,383 --> 01:49:38,802
Well, that does defy explanation.

1801
01:49:57,321 --> 01:49:58,322
Not bad.

1802
01:51:23,115 --> 01:51:25,075
Oh. What is wrong with this thing?

1803
01:51:25,159 --> 01:51:27,161
Infernal machine.

1804
01:51:28,912 --> 01:51:30,372
- There, much better.

1805
01:51:31,456 --> 01:51:35,836
Shoes, facelift, nose job, Ibiza,

1806
01:51:35,919 --> 01:51:39,548
big old house in the country, lingerie.

1807
01:51:39,631 --> 01:51:41,592
It's the Cartel. They've gone down.

1808
01:51:41,675 --> 01:51:43,927
- We ain't done nothin'.

1809
01:51:44,011 --> 01:51:45,971
Oh, except poison all them chocolates.

1810
01:51:46,054 --> 01:51:47,598
- Police. Open up.

1811
01:51:47,681 --> 01:51:48,721
Quick! Drink the evidence.

1812
01:51:50,767 --> 01:51:51,977
Oh, just a second, Officer.

1813
01:51:52,060 --> 01:51:53,228
- Police.

1814
01:51:53,312 --> 01:51:55,272
I'm on the toilet, Officer.

1815
01:51:55,355 --> 01:51:56,356
Open up.

1816
01:51:56,440 --> 01:51:58,317
-One wipe, and I'm done.

1817
01:51:58,400 --> 01:52:00,007
Oh, there's more coming,hang on a minute.

1818
01:52:00,027 --> 01:52:01,028
Right.

1819
01:52:04,489 --> 01:52:05,490
Wow.

1820
01:52:06,825 --> 01:52:08,619
How can we help you, Officer?

1821
01:52:08,827 --> 01:52:09,912
You two are comin' with me.

1822
01:52:09,995 --> 01:52:11,246
But we ain't done nothin'.

1823
01:52:11,330 --> 01:52:13,624
You're going away for a very long time.

1824
01:52:13,707 --> 01:52:15,834
One last kiss, my lord?

1825
01:52:15,918 --> 01:52:18,170
- Oh, Puffy-wuffy.
