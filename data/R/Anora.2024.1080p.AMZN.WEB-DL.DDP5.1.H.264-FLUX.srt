91
00:04:54,169 --> 00:04:56,547
And then he bought
five dances from me.

92
00:04:58,590 --> 00:05:01,427
That's fucking disgusting.

93
00:05:01,552 --> 00:05:03,429

he bought the dances.

00:05:35,169 --> 00:05:37,049
Seriously, he came out
of the bathroom one time,

105
00:05:37,129 --> 00:05:38,756
and he didn't zip up
his fucking pants.

106
00:05:38,881 --> 00:05:40,215
It's like, if you can't zip up

107

00:05:44,219 --> 00:05:45,262
Dude, he's 40.

110
00:05:45,387 --> 00:05:46,930
He's literally geriatric.

111
00:05:47,056 --> 00:05:48,533
- No, I know. It's like...
- Ani.

112
00:05:48,557 --> 00:05:51,060
I got a kid who wants someone
who speaks Russian.

113
00:05:51,185 --> 00:05:53,479
You know, Jimmy, the girls
and I have been talking,

114
00:05:53,604 --> 00:05:57,316
and if your cousin doesn't
start showing us some respect,

115
00:05:57,441 --> 00:05:58,984
we're not gonna tip out
anymore.

116
00:05:59,109 --> 00:06:00,829
- All right. I'll talk to him.
- Yeah.

117
00:06:00,861 --> 00:06:02,613
Who are you talking about,
the DJ?

118
00:06:02,738 --> 00:06:04,907
- All right, seriously?
- He's an asshole.

119
00:06:05,032 --> 00:06:06,617
I shared my playlist with him,

120
00:06:06,742 --> 00:06:08,452
and he was very rude
and dismissive.

121
00:06:08,577 --> 00:06:09,745
You're killing me.

122
00:06:09,870 --> 00:06:11,205
Let's go. Come on.

123
00:06:11,330 --> 00:06:12,664
No. No, I'm eating my food.

124
00:06:12,790 --> 00:06:14,100
That's why you have Tupperware.

125
00:06:14,124 --> 00:06:15,560
- To keep things fresh.
- She's eating.

126
00:06:15,584 --> 00:06:16,895
He's a spender.

127
00:06:16,919 --> 00:06:18,719

00:08:10,657 --> 00:08:12,910
Oh, so you're on vacation or...

179
00:08:13,035 --> 00:08:14,453
Mm, yeah, vacation.

180
00:08:14,578 --> 00:08:16,121
I guess you can say that. Yeah.

181
00:08:16,246 --> 00:08:17,956
But I'm speaking, uh...

182
00:08:18,081 --> 00:08:20,667
May I switch to Russian?

183
00:08:20,792 --> 00:08:22,896
- Yeah? Yeah.
- Oh, yeah. Whatever you want.

184
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:24,520
Yeah, because my English
sounds terrible.

185
00:08:24,546 --> 00:08:26,548
- At all, yeah.
- No, no, no.

186
00:08:26,673 --> 00:08:28,634
- Your English is really good.
- Yeah.

187
00:08:28,759 --> 00:08:32,179
And that's why
I think we should toast

188
00:08:32,304 --> 00:08:34,389
to our fucking bad accents

189
00:08:34,514 --> 00:08:37,059
with a bottle.

190
00:08:38,101 --> 00:08:41,021
Yeah. And you want
to go to VIP, maybe?

191
00:08:41,146 --> 00:08:42,981
Yeah, excellent. I want.

192
00:08:47,402 --> 00:08:49,905
Oh.

193
00:08:50,864 --> 00:08:53,158
You work in a cool
place.

194
00:08:53,283 --> 00:08:54,923
Yeah, it's a cool place.

195
00:08:54,952 --> 00:08:56,912
And the room I'm bringing
you to is really nice.

196
00:08:57,037 --> 00:08:58,789
Mm-hmm.

197
00:08:59,873 --> 00:09:01,333
- Wow. Mm.
- Right in there.

198
00:09:04,211 --> 00:09:06,129
- Mm.
- You're very good, really.

199
00:09:08,340 --> 00:09:11,802
And one more. Yeah.

00:09:14,054 --> 00:09:15,097

whiskey cola.

251
00:12:41,052 --> 00:12:42,387
Coca-Cola, maybe?

252
00:12:42,512 --> 00:12:43,930
No, a water's good.

253
00:12:44,055 --> 00:12:45,640

255
00:12:48,393 --> 00:12:50,562
Uh, sparkling or flat water?

256
00:12:50,687 --> 00:12:53,565
Um, either is good.

257
00:12:55,484 --> 00:12:56,902
Oh...

258
00:12:57,027 --> 00:12:58,587
Where's the
fucking water?

259
00:12:58,695 --> 00:12:59,988
Wow.

260
00:13:02,157 --> 00:13:03,700
Not too shabby.

261
00:13:03,825 --> 00:13:05,911
What is "shabby"?

262
00:13:06,036 --> 00:13:07,829
Oh, I'm-I'm just playing.

263
00:13:07,954 --> 00:13:11,500
I meant
your home is-is beautiful.

264
00:13:11,625 --> 00:13:14,127
My home is okay, girl.

265
00:13:14,252 --> 00:13:15,712
Um, sparkling.

266
00:13:15,837 --> 00:13:17,255
Thank you.

267
00:13:17,380 --> 00:13:20,800
Bedroom's upstairs. Let's go.

268
00:13:22,093 --> 00:13:23,595
Okay.

269
00:13:26,473 --> 00:13:28,350
Oh, sorry.
I am waiting for you.

270
00:13:28,475 --> 00:13:29,851
Oh.

271
00:13:29,976 --> 00:13:32,270
I'll hurry up.

272
00:13:34,564 --> 00:13:36,274
They didn't make my bed yet.

273
00:13:36,399 --> 00:13:38,193
Fuck. Is it so
difficult?

274
00:13:39,110 --> 00:13:40,362
Sorry.

275
00:13:40,779 --> 00:13:42,656
Whoa.

276
00:13:46,368 --> 00:13:48,411
Nice view.

277
00:13:49,454 --> 00:13:51,039
My view's better.

278
00:13:53,875 --> 00:13:57,420
Okay.
So, what are you looking for?

279
00:13:57,546 --> 00:13:59,714
Um, sex.

280
00:14:00,924 --> 00:14:02,884
Yeah, I know.

281
00:14:03,009 --> 00:14:05,887
I mean, like, anything special?

282
00:14:06,012 --> 00:14:07,931
Yeah, special sex.

283
00:14:10,058 --> 00:14:11,601
- Special sex.
- Mm-hmm.

284
00:14:11,726 --> 00:14:12,978
Okay.

285
00:14:13,103 --> 00:14:15,355
So, like, a little bit
of everything?

286
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:17,899
A little bit of...

287
00:14:18,024 --> 00:14:20,610
Yes! Sounds
fucking amazing!

288
00:14:21,152 --> 00:14:23,032
You want to take
your clothes off?

289
00:14:23,154 --> 00:14:24,656
Yeah.

290
00:14:35,792 --> 00:14:36,960
Wow. Okay.

291
00:14:39,629 --> 00:14:42,132
- You want to put this on?
- Hmm?

292
00:14:42,257 --> 00:14:44,801
Or do you want me
to put it on for you?

293
00:14:46,219 --> 00:14:47,387
- Faster.
- Mm-hmm.

294
00:14:47,512 --> 00:14:49,514
Faster, faster.

295
00:14:49,639 --> 00:14:51,891
- Faster. Faster. Faster.
- Mm-hmm.

296
00:14:52,017 --> 00:14:53,310
- Stop. Stop. Stop.
- Okay.

297
00:14:53,435 --> 00:14:55,228
- So you want me to stop?
- Stop, stop, stop!

298
00:14:55,353 --> 00:14:56,813
- I said...
- Okay.

299
00:15:05,614 --> 00:15:07,991
Ah. Want you?

300
00:15:10,577 --> 00:15:12,495
Oh, uh, sure.

301
00:15:12,621 --> 00:15:14,873
S-S-S-Sure.

302
00:15:14,998 --> 00:15:17,417
But be careful
with that shit, yeah?

303
00:15:17,542 --> 00:15:19,044
Careful. Ah.

304
00:15:22,964 --> 00:15:24,382
And that's for you.

305
00:15:24,507 --> 00:15:25,592
Tip.

306
00:15:25,717 --> 00:15:27,969
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

307
00:15:28,094 --> 00:15:30,055
That's very generous of you.

308
00:15:30,180 --> 00:15:32,307
And I want to say
one more thing.

309
00:15:32,432 --> 00:15:33,432
Yes.

310
00:15:33,516 --> 00:15:35,393
It was really amazing.

311
00:15:37,687 --> 00:15:39,105
Oh, oh, oh.

312
00:15:41,232 --> 00:15:42,525
I love these guys.
You know them?

313
00:15:42,651 --> 00:15:44,361
No.

314
00:15:44,486 --> 00:15:46,696
Oh. You must know them.

315
00:15:54,621 --> 00:15:57,749
So, um, how old are you?

316
00:15:57,874 --> 00:15:59,167
Twenty-one.

317
00:15:59,292 --> 00:16:00,502
How old are you?

318
00:16:00,627 --> 00:16:02,253
Mm, older than you.

319
00:16:02,379 --> 00:16:05,048
How old are you?
25?

320
00:16:05,632 --> 00:16:07,884
No, I'm-I'm 23.

321
00:16:08,009 --> 00:16:09,636
Oh, wow.

322
00:16:09,969 --> 00:16:13,056
You act like you
are 25.

323
00:16:13,973 --> 00:16:16,518
Okay.

324
00:16:18,019 --> 00:16:19,396
You're funny.

325
00:16:19,521 --> 00:16:20,689
Yeah, I know.

326
00:16:20,814 --> 00:16:23,316
So, funny? Why?

327
00:16:24,359 --> 00:16:26,277
I don't know.

328
00:16:26,403 --> 00:16:27,862
You're just... you're, like...

329
00:16:27,987 --> 00:16:29,155
You're funny. It's...

330
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:30,782
Funny cool, right?

331
00:16:30,907 --> 00:16:32,117
- Yeah, of course.
- Yeah.

332
00:16:32,242 --> 00:16:33,868
Really funny cool.

333
00:16:38,665 --> 00:16:40,792
And if you don't
mind me asking,

334
00:16:40,917 --> 00:16:43,753
like, what do you do
to get all of this?

335
00:16:44,671 --> 00:16:46,756
What do you think I do?

336
00:16:46,881 --> 00:16:49,426
Well, what do you think
I think you do?

337
00:16:49,551 --> 00:16:53,179
Oh, fucking English.

338
00:16:53,304 --> 00:16:55,348
Mm. Okay. I can say,

339
00:16:55,473 --> 00:16:59,769
but it's, uh...
it's really big secret.

340
00:16:59,894 --> 00:17:01,146
Okay.

341
00:17:01,271 --> 00:17:04,733
I'm really big drug dealer.

342
00:17:06,860 --> 00:17:08,361
Oh, really?

343
00:17:08,486 --> 00:17:10,613
Why you trust...?

344
00:17:10,739 --> 00:17:12,073
No.

345
00:17:12,198 --> 00:17:13,950
But I'm really big gun dealer.

346
00:17:14,075 --> 00:17:16,077
Mm. Okay.

347
00:17:16,202 --> 00:17:17,245
Come on.

348
00:17:17,370 --> 00:17:19,122
Oh, my God.

349
00:17:24,419 --> 00:17:27,005
Wait, so, like, you made
some app or something?

350
00:17:27,130 --> 00:17:29,716
- Is that...
- Yeah. Yeah. I-I made.

351
00:17:29,841 --> 00:17:32,302
I do have
some cool ideas for apps...

352
00:17:32,427 --> 00:17:35,221
No, but no, no. I... No.

353
00:17:36,431 --> 00:17:38,558
Okay.

354
00:17:38,683 --> 00:17:41,060
My father...

355
00:17:41,186 --> 00:17:42,186
Yeah?

356
00:17:42,687 --> 00:17:44,272
Long story
short...

357
00:17:44,397 --> 00:17:46,816
my dad is Nikolai Zakharov.

358
00:17:49,277 --> 00:17:50,862
- Whoa.
- Sorry.

359
00:17:50,987 --> 00:17:53,782
I don't know who that is.

360

00:26:46,564 --> 00:26:50,443
Simply be my
girlfriend for the week.

538
00:26:50,568 --> 00:26:53,696
My horny
girlfriend for the week.

539
00:27:02,330 --> 00:27:06,292
Oh. What about...

540
00:27:06,417 --> 00:27:08,753
ten K of dollars?

541
00:27:15,301 --> 00:27:16,594
Fifteen.

542
00:27:16,719 --> 00:27:18,095
Cash, up front.

543
00:27:19,180 --> 00:27:20,806
Deal.

544
00:27:24,352 --> 00:27:25,895
Deal.

545
00:27:28,356 --> 00:27:31,484
You know,
I would've done it for ten.

546
00:27:31,609 --> 00:27:33,152
Well, if I were
you,

547
00:27:33,277 --> 00:27:36,113
I wouldn't do it for less
than thirty.

548
00:27:45,831 --> 00:27:47,208

- Okay. Thank you.

565
00:28:25,788 --> 00:28:27,456
Tell him,
because I don't want to.

566
00:28:27,581 --> 00:28:29,351
- I am gonna fucking tell him.
- What's going on?

567
00:28:29,375 --> 00:28:31,055
- You don't even want to know.
- Hi, Jimmy.

568
00:28:31,085 --> 00:28:32,562
You don't want to fucking know,
Jimmy.

569
00:28:32,586 --> 00:28:34,306
- How are you doing?
- She wants a week off.

570
00:28:34,338 --> 00:28:37,716
- I thought you wanted me to tell him.
- You see the shit that I have to deal with?

571
00:28:37,842 --> 00:28:40,469
I just made the schedule.
Now she wants to pull this bullshit.

572
00:28:40,594 --> 00:28:41,679
Oh.
The schedule.

573
00:28:41,804 --> 00:28:44,181
- We just gave you New Year's.
- Oh, Jesus Christ, Jimmy,

574
00:28:44,306 --> 00:28:45,724
once you give me
health insurance,

575
00:28:45,850 --> 00:28:48,436
workers' comp
and a fucking 401,

576
00:28:48,561 --> 00:28:50,688
then you can tell me
when I work and not work.

577
00:28:50,813 --> 00:28:53,482
Well, none of that's
gonna happen, so...

578
00:28:53,607 --> 00:28:55,443
- Shocker.
- Bye.

579
00:29:01,407 --> 00:29:03,284
I'll be back on Tuesday.

580
00:29:03,409 --> 00:29:04,452
Today is Tuesday.

581
00:29:04,577 --> 00:29:06,370
Correct.

582
00:29:06,495 --> 00:29:08,706
- That's a week.
- No shit.

583
00:29:14,044 --> 00:29:16,380
Thank you.

584
00:29:29,018 --> 00:29:30,603
- You like that?
- No.

585
00:29:36,734 --> 00:29:40,404
You know, Ani, it's the
champagne glass of my mother.

586
00:29:40,529 --> 00:29:42,114
Of my fucking mother.

587
00:29:42,239 --> 00:29:44,742
And it will be
your champagne glass.

588
00:29:44,867 --> 00:29:47,036
And what we are cheering for?

589
00:29:47,161 --> 00:29:49,455
About my new girlfriend.

590
00:29:49,580 --> 00:29:51,790
- Hell yeah. To Ani.
- Yeah.

591
00:29:51,916 --> 00:29:53,834
To the most
amazing chick.

592
00:29:53,959 --> 00:29:56,212
Yeah.

593
00:29:56,337 --> 00:29:57,657
- One more. One more.
- Okay.

594
00:29:57,713 --> 00:29:58,756
Instantly. Instantly.

595
00:30:20,110 --> 00:30:21,362
Fuck.

596
00:30:24,031 --> 00:30:26,116
Klara, maybe you want a hit?

597
00:30:26,450 --> 00:30:28,577
Sorry, Ivan. Not today.

598
00:30:28,911 --> 00:30:30,663
Mm-hmm.

599
00:30:30,788 --> 00:30:32,581
It was really
funny when, uh,

600
00:30:32,706 --> 00:30:34,291
Klara smoked
last time.

601
00:30:34,416 --> 00:30:36,656
My mother, uh, caught her
in the cryo chamber.

602
00:30:37,086 --> 00:30:38,212
What?

603
00:30:38,337 --> 00:30:40,047
Nothing, just keep working.

604
00:30:41,382 --> 00:30:42,859
You have a cryo
chamber?

605
00:30:42,883 --> 00:30:43,883
Yeah.

606
00:30:47,388 --> 00:30:48,931
Oh, shit.

607
00:30:49,056 --> 00:30:50,766
Yeah, but I'm not allowed
to drive them

608
00:30:50,891 --> 00:30:52,810
because my parents are dicks.

609
00:30:55,646 --> 00:30:56,897
- What's up?
- How are you?

610
00:30:57,022 --> 00:30:58,375
- I'm good.
- Yeah, what's up, man?

611
00:30:58,399 --> 00:30:59,543
- What's up, Ivan?
- Welcome.

612
00:30:59,567 --> 00:31:01,670
You guys can just, like,
eat whatever the fuck you want.

613
00:31:01,694 --> 00:31:02,694
We got ice cream.

614
00:31:02,736 --> 00:31:04,214
There's, like,
whatever the fuck these are.

615
00:31:04,238 --> 00:31:05,072
There's Ring Pops.

616
00:31:05,197 --> 00:31:06,917
Like, literally,
I just fuck around in here.

617
00:31:07,032 --> 00:31:09,535
The boss is old as fuck,
and he's, like, blind and deaf.

618
00:31:09,660 --> 00:31:11,220
He can't even fucking
hear us right now,

619
00:31:11,287 --> 00:31:12,889

the best ketamine I ever tried

654
00:32:47,883 --> 00:32:49,218
was in Vegas!

655
00:32:49,677 --> 00:32:52,137
Vegas.
It's a great idea.

656
00:32:52,262 --> 00:32:54,556
We are going to fucking Vegas.

657
00:33:01,814 --> 00:33:03,691
Welcome to Vegas!

658
00:33:07,152 --> 00:33:08,987
We're in Vegas, bitch!

659
00:33:09,113 --> 00:33:11,490
- Ah.
- Welcome back, Mr. Zakharov.

660
00:33:11,615 --> 00:33:13,575
Your suite is almost ready.

661
00:33:13,701 --> 00:33:14,993
We didn't know you were coming,

662
00:33:15,119 --> 00:33:16,719
- and the suite was occupied...
- Uh-huh.

663
00:33:16,745 --> 00:33:18,038
...but they're out,

664
00:33:18,163 --> 00:33:20,207
and housekeeping
should be done any minute.

665
00:33:21,500 --> 00:33:23,419
What the fuck, man?
Are you fucking kidding me?

666
00:33:23,544 --> 00:33:25,003
You mean I have to wait?

667
00:33:25,129 --> 00:33:26,964
You mean we have to wait
right now, bro, yes?

668

- Vanya, wait, wait, wait.
- What happened?

713
00:35:42,850 --> 00:35:44,726
Well, you know,
it could last longer

714
00:35:44,852 --> 00:35:48,105
and be better
if you just take it easy.

715
00:35:48,230 --> 00:35:49,439
Like, how?

716
00:35:49,565 --> 00:35:51,692
Here. Let me do it.

717
00:35:52,776 --> 00:35:54,695
Ah.

718
00:35:58,365 --> 00:35:59,575
Mm-hmm.

719
00:35:59,700 --> 00:36:01,201
Oh, I think I love you.

720
00:36:01,326 --> 00:36:03,161
Fuck.

721
00:36:09,710 --> 00:36:11,545
I hope you had fun this week.

722
00:36:11,670 --> 00:36:13,380
I hope you had fun
this week.

723
00:36:13,505 --> 00:36:15,215
Oh, I did.

724
00:36:16,466 --> 00:36:18,176
You know, we should
do it again sometime.

725
00:36:18,302 --> 00:36:19,761
Yeah.

726
00:36:19,887 --> 00:36:22,014
For sure.

727
00:36:22,139 --> 00:36:24,433
Mm, but...

728
00:36:24,558 --> 00:36:28,770
I have to go back to Russia
because I promised my father

729
00:36:28,896 --> 00:36:31,773
that I would start working
in his fucking company.

730
00:36:31,899 --> 00:36:33,775
Oh.

731
00:36:33,901 --> 00:36:37,112
Okay, so that's why
you've been splashing out, hmm?

732
00:36:37,237 --> 00:36:39,489
Eh, no, I am always
partying like this.

733
00:36:39,615 --> 00:36:40,699
Mm.

734
00:36:40,824 --> 00:36:42,451
I love it.

735
00:36:48,624 --> 00:36:50,292
Well, I'm gonna miss you.

736
00:36:51,877 --> 00:36:54,379
- What?
- What?

737
00:36:54,504 --> 00:36:56,757
Does that, like, sound weird?

738
00:36:56,882 --> 00:36:58,175
No, no.

739
00:36:58,300 --> 00:37:00,802
And will you miss me
or my money blyat?

740
00:37:00,928 --> 00:37:03,096
Or your money blyat.

741
00:37:03,221 --> 00:37:06,058
- Of course.
- Yeah, I like it.

742
00:37:06,183 --> 00:37:09,853
But, mm, if I get married
to an American,

743
00:37:09,978 --> 00:37:12,022
I wouldn't have to go back
to Russia.

744
00:37:14,232 --> 00:37:15,776
- Oh, yeah?
- Mm-hmm.

745
00:37:15,901 --> 00:37:17,361
Okay.

746
00:37:17,486 --> 00:37:18,987
So, who would you marry?

747
00:37:19,112 --> 00:37:20,697
I don't know.

748
00:37:20,822 --> 00:37:23,075
Maybe Crystal.

749
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:25,160
Or your friend Lulu.

750
00:37:25,285 --> 00:37:27,329
She's so hot.

751
00:37:29,039 --> 00:37:30,958
You.

752
00:37:31,083 --> 00:37:32,834
"You."

753
00:37:33,752 --> 00:37:35,462
It's Vegas.

754
00:37:35,587 --> 00:37:36,713
It's fucking Vegas.

755
00:37:36,838 --> 00:37:38,256
Don't people get married
in Vegas?

756
00:37:38,382 --> 00:37:40,592
Mm... Don't fuck around.

757
00:37:40,717 --> 00:37:43,887
I am not fucking around.

758
00:37:45,013 --> 00:37:46,640
Okay.

759
00:37:48,058 --> 00:37:49,518
Okay, go.

760
00:37:49,643 --> 00:37:51,478
- Go get married.
- Yes.

761
00:37:51,603 --> 00:37:53,313
Yes, let's get married.

762
00:37:53,438 --> 00:37:54,815
Fuck. You asshole.

763
00:37:54,940 --> 00:37:56,483
- Why?
- Don't.

764
00:37:56,608 --> 00:37:59,403
Like, don't fucking tease me
with that shit, okay?

765
00:37:59,528 --> 00:38:01,113
- Stop.
- It ain't cool.

766
00:38:01,238 --> 00:38:03,615
Stop, stop, stop.

767
00:38:03,740 --> 00:38:05,659
- Ani.
- Yeah?

768
00:38:05,784 --> 00:38:08,745
Will you marry me?

769
00:38:10,747 --> 00:38:13,083
- Seriously?
- Seriously.

770
00:38:13,208 --> 00:38:15,127
Mm-hmm.

771
00:38:15,252 --> 00:38:18,005
So you want to get married
to me, Vanya?

772
00:38:18,130 --> 00:38:20,257
You want me to be
your little wifey?

773
00:38:20,382 --> 00:38:21,800
Yeah?

774
00:38:21,925 --> 00:38:23,510
Yes.

775
00:38:23,635 --> 00:38:27,222
I just think that we had
great time together, and, uh...

776
00:38:27,347 --> 00:38:30,183
Shit, I'm nervous.
I'll say it in Russian.

777
00:38:30,600 --> 00:38:33,103
I think
we would have a great time

778
00:38:33,228 --> 00:38:35,480
even if I didn't have money.

779
00:38:35,939 --> 00:38:37,941
And I will become
American,

780
00:38:38,066 --> 00:38:40,819
and my parents
will suck my dick.

781
00:38:46,074 --> 00:38:48,076
Are you serious?

782
00:38:50,078 --> 00:38:52,247

about our honeymoon,

834
00:40:58,915 --> 00:41:00,834
and I think we should do it
at Disney World

835
00:41:00,959 --> 00:41:02,419
because that's been,
like, my dream

836
00:41:02,544 --> 00:41:04,254
- since I've been a little girl.
- Stop.

837
00:41:04,379 --> 00:41:06,214
Yeah. You know those suites

838
00:41:06,339 --> 00:41:08,508
where it's, like,
the Disney Princess theme?

839
00:41:08,633 --> 00:41:10,927
- Cinderella.
- Yes, fucking Cinderella.

840
00:41:11,052 --> 00:41:12,971

so fucking well, babe.

841
00:41:13,096 --> 00:41:15,640
Bye, Ani.
You better visit us, bitch.

842
00:41:15,765 --> 00:41:18,059
Oh, of course I will, Jenny.

843
00:41:18,185 --> 00:41:20,770
- Bye, babe.
- Caught your whale?

844
00:41:20,896 --> 00:41:22,606
Seems I did, didn't I?

845
00:41:22,731 --> 00:41:25,358

find your happiness one day.

Stay jealous, honey.

855
00:41:46,755 --> 00:41:48,048
Jealousy is a disease.

857

the Russian and get over there.

888
00:44:13,818 --> 00:44:15,779

- Hmm?

889
00:44:17,655 --> 00:44:18,815
What did, uh...

890
00:44:18,907 --> 00:44:21,451
what did they say when you told
them?

891
00:44:21,576 --> 00:44:25,872

talk about them.

00:44:28,917 --> 00:44:31,336
Well, you did tell them, right?

893
00:44:31,461 --> 00:44:34,005
Mm. Sure.

894
00:44:37,759 --> 00:44:39,636
I mean...

895
00:44:39,761 --> 00:44:42,389
This is good news, right?

896
00:44:43,681 --> 00:44:47,769
Parents usually want
their kids to get married.

897
00:44:48,728 --> 00:44:50,271
Yeah,

898
00:44:50,397 --> 00:44:52,816
but my parents are dicks,
you know.

899
00:44:53,274 --> 00:44:56,277
Uh, whatever. Mm.

900
00:44:58,238 --> 00:45:00,281
No matter what,

901
00:45:00,407 --> 00:45:03,451
I hope they like me...

902
00:45:03,576 --> 00:45:05,245
You know...

903
00:45:05,703 --> 00:45:08,748
when we meet.

904
00:45:11,501 --> 00:45:13,002
By the way,

905
00:45:13,128 --> 00:45:16,423
when will we meet your parents?

906
00:45:16,548 --> 00:45:18,591
Mm...

907
00:45:21,928 --> 00:45:25,348
Well, if you want
to go to Miami...

908
00:45:26,141 --> 00:45:29,644
My mom lives there with her man.

909
00:45:30,311 --> 00:45:34,816
And you can meet
my sister anytime.

910
00:45:35,817 --> 00:45:40,321
Although I'm sure
she'll try to steal you.

911
00:45:40,447 --> 00:45:43,116
She loves Russian guys.

912
00:45:46,161 --> 00:45:49,247
What?
Are you making fun of me?

913
00:45:49,372 --> 00:45:51,166
I'm trying here, asshole.

914
00:45:51,291 --> 00:45:53,227
No, your Russian
is wonderful! Really.

915
00:45:53,251 --> 00:45:54,854
Every single day
you're doing better and better.

916
00:45:54,878 --> 00:45:57,338
You're almost like
a native speaker.

917
00:45:57,464 --> 00:45:59,466
Oh, okay.

918
00:45:59,591 --> 00:46:00,751
- You're a liar.
- No, no, no.

919
00:46:00,842 --> 00:46:02,135
Not now. Ani, not now.

920
00:46:02,510 --> 00:46:04,888
I'm playing.
I have a mission.

921
00:46:05,013 --> 00:46:07,307
Give me the controller.

922
00:46:07,432 --> 00:46:08,808
I lost!

923
00:46:11,686 --> 00:46:13,980
- Okay.
- Okay.

924
00:46:15,148 --> 00:46:16,774
"Arguments and
Facts"

925
00:46:16,900 --> 00:46:19,152
ran a photo of him with
some chick

926
00:46:19,277 --> 00:46:21,279
at an NBA game.

927
00:46:22,155 --> 00:46:25,366
And they are saying
she's a prostitute.

928
00:46:29,662 --> 00:46:31,289
It's not funny, man.

929
00:46:31,414 --> 00:46:32,957
Don't you dare laugh.

930
00:46:33,082 --> 00:46:36,711
If it's true,
Toros and I are fucked.

931
00:46:37,170 --> 00:46:41,633
Well, Toros would be fucked
more than me, but still.

932
00:46:41,758 --> 00:46:43,927
Sounds like tabloid bullshit.

933
00:46:44,052 --> 00:46:45,678
Probably.

934
00:46:45,803 --> 00:46:48,848
But listen, if things get crazy,

935
00:46:48,973 --> 00:46:50,850
don't get rough with Ivan.

936
00:46:50,975 --> 00:46:54,062
Actually, don't even touch Ivan,
let me deal with him.

937
00:46:54,187 --> 00:46:56,523
I got you. But what
do you need me for then?

938
00:46:56,648 --> 00:46:59,067
In case his boys are there

939
00:46:59,192 --> 00:47:01,486
and they want to play games.

940
00:47:01,986 --> 00:47:05,240
Hey. Is Ivan at
the house?

941
00:47:05,365 --> 00:47:06,616
I don't know.

942
00:47:06,741 --> 00:47:08,135
He hasn't left
since I've been here,

943
00:47:08,159 --> 00:47:10,453
but I just started my shift.

944
00:47:10,578 --> 00:47:13,039
Do you know if he got married?

945
00:47:13,164 --> 00:47:14,791
Married?

946
00:47:14,916 --> 00:47:17,168
I have no idea.
I just got here.

947
00:47:17,293 --> 00:47:19,337
Okay, open the gate.

948
00:47:21,047 --> 00:47:23,800
Drive in
and park on the right side.

949
00:47:28,263 --> 00:47:29,597
Right here.

950
00:47:52,161 --> 00:47:54,831
- Expecting guests?
- No way.

951
00:48:03,798 --> 00:48:05,049
Oh.

952
00:48:05,592 --> 00:48:07,260
Yo, what do you
want?

953
00:48:07,385 --> 00:48:08,970
Ivan, it's Garnik.

954
00:48:09,095 --> 00:48:10,972
I know. What do you want?

955
00:48:11,097 --> 00:48:13,308
Ivan, open the door, please.

956
00:48:13,433 --> 00:48:16,811
- I'm busy. No.
- We have to talk.

957
00:48:16,936 --> 00:48:18,896
Why do I always have
to repeat myself with you?

958
00:48:19,022 --> 00:48:21,107
I'm busy, I have guests.

959
00:48:21,232 --> 00:48:22,712
Ivan, it's important.
We have to talk.

960
00:48:22,817 --> 00:48:25,903
No, we're done.
Get the fuck out of here.

961
00:48:26,446 --> 00:48:27,655
Who was that?

962
00:48:27,780 --> 00:48:29,100
They're my father's monkeys.

963
00:48:29,616 --> 00:48:31,409
Son of a bitch.

964
00:48:33,745 --> 00:48:35,097
What the
fuck?

965
00:48:35,121 --> 00:48:36,557
Are you fucking
kidding me?

966
00:48:36,581 --> 00:48:37,874
What the fuck are
you doing?

967
00:48:37,999 --> 00:48:39,679
You think you can enter
my house like this?

968
00:48:39,792 --> 00:48:42,521
- Vanya, what the fuck?
- Slow down, you'll break my leg.

969
00:48:42,545 --> 00:48:43,545
I don't give a fuck.

970
00:48:43,630 --> 00:48:45,691
- Vanya, should I call 911?
- It's okay. It's okay.

971
00:48:45,715 --> 00:48:47,925
Ivan, your father
sent us.

972
00:48:48,051 --> 00:48:49,851
Right, my father sent you.
Are you kidding me?

973
00:48:49,927 --> 00:48:53,973
Well, not us. Your father sent
Toros and Toros sent us.

974
00:48:54,098 --> 00:48:56,100
So, where's Toros?

975
00:48:56,476 --> 00:48:57,852
He's busy.

976
00:48:57,977 --> 00:49:01,064
But he will be very upset
with you if this is true.

977
00:49:01,189 --> 00:49:02,231
If what is true?

978
00:49:02,357 --> 00:49:03,358
That you got married

979
00:49:03,483 --> 00:49:04,484
to some prostitute.

980
00:49:04,984 --> 00:49:06,319
What?

981
00:49:07,612 --> 00:49:08,988
Is that her?

982
00:49:09,113 --> 00:49:11,240
- Are you married to her?
- Yes!

983
00:49:11,366 --> 00:49:12,909
Did you lose your fucking mind?

984
00:49:13,034 --> 00:49:15,286
Yes, we married
and we're doing fucking great!

985
00:49:15,411 --> 00:49:16,663
With a signature and paperwork?

986
00:49:16,788 --> 00:49:20,291
Yes. Now get the fuck out
of my house.

987
00:49:20,416 --> 00:49:22,794
You're in big trouble, brother!

988
00:49:22,919 --> 00:49:25,797
You'll be in trouble if
you don't move your fucking leg.

989
00:49:25,922 --> 00:49:28,049
Vanya, what the
fuck is going on?

990
00:49:28,424 --> 00:49:30,694
We'll wait, I need
to see the marriage license.

991
00:49:30,718 --> 00:49:32,261
Fuck. Are you serious?

992
00:49:32,387 --> 00:49:35,890
Bro, the faster we do it,
the faster we're out of here.

993
00:49:36,015 --> 00:49:38,184
My parents are fucking crazy!

994
00:49:38,309 --> 00:49:39,811
Okay.

995
00:49:39,936 --> 00:49:42,081
If my parents need
proof, I'll give them proof.

996
00:49:42,105 --> 00:49:43,874
Uh, where
is the marriage paper?

997
00:49:43,898 --> 00:49:45,250
- Uh, marriage...
- The marriage license?

998
00:49:45,274 --> 00:49:46,502
- License, yeah.
- It's, um...

999
00:49:46,526 --> 00:49:48,027
It's in the desk
in the office. Why?

1000
00:49:48,152 --> 00:49:49,592
- Okay. Uh...
- Should I go with you?

1001
00:49:49,696 --> 00:49:51,280
Uh, no, no, no. Stay here.

1002
00:49:51,406 --> 00:49:52,699
Wait here.

1003
00:50:10,174 --> 00:50:11,884
Hi.

1004
00:50:25,648 --> 00:50:27,817
Here.
Choke on it, dude.

1005
00:50:42,665 --> 00:50:44,083
I'm Igor.

1006
00:50:45,877 --> 00:50:46,919
You?

1007
00:50:49,255 --> 00:50:51,299
Ani.

1008
00:50:51,424 --> 00:50:53,384
I'm Vanya's wife.

1009
00:50:57,597 --> 00:50:59,390
Congratulations.

1010
00:51:02,477 --> 00:51:03,757
What are you
doing?

1011
00:51:04,312 --> 00:51:08,691
I've been asked to take a photo
of the license... if it exists.

1012
00:51:08,816 --> 00:51:09,942
That's insane.

1013
00:51:10,067 --> 00:51:11,694
My parents asked for that?

1014
00:51:11,819 --> 00:51:12,987
Toros.

1015
00:51:13,112 --> 00:51:14,947
Are you fucking kidding me?

1016
00:51:37,345 --> 00:51:39,096
No.

1017
00:51:42,683 --> 00:51:44,769
What the fuck is going on here?

1018
00:51:50,399 --> 00:51:52,276
I have no idea.

1019
00:51:56,572 --> 00:51:58,241
It's over, go, go,
go, go...

1020
00:51:58,366 --> 00:51:59,575
Wait.

1021
00:51:59,700 --> 00:52:01,035
Wait.

1022
00:52:01,160 --> 00:52:02,971
- Is everything okay?
- Yeah, it's okay.

1023
00:52:02,995 --> 00:52:04,413
Yeah? What the fuck
is going on?

1024
00:52:04,539 --> 00:52:06,249
Yeah, just time
to say goodbye to guys.

1025
00:52:06,374 --> 00:52:08,793
Me and my wife
need some privacy.

1026
00:52:08,918 --> 00:52:11,003
You look tired, Garnik, go home.

1027
00:52:11,128 --> 00:52:13,422
We need to wait to see
what Toros says.

1028
00:52:13,548 --> 00:52:16,592
I'm waiting for you
and your fucking Armenian ass

1029
00:52:16,717 --> 00:52:18,010
to be out of my house.

1030
00:52:28,062 --> 00:52:29,522
Sorry.

1031
00:52:31,774 --> 00:52:33,442
So sorry.

1032
00:52:33,568 --> 00:52:35,653
I'm so sorry. Excuse me.

1033
00:52:36,696 --> 00:52:39,282
I'm waiting for
you to be on your fucking way.

1034
00:52:39,407 --> 00:52:40,449
Bye, bro!

1035
00:52:40,575 --> 00:52:42,368
Ivan...

1036
00:52:42,743 --> 00:52:44,245
It's Toros.

1037
00:52:45,079 --> 00:52:46,330
"Stand by."

1038
00:52:46,455 --> 00:52:48,332
..."Stand by"?

1039
00:52:48,457 --> 00:52:51,043
He texted, "Stand by,"
so we stand by.

1040
00:52:51,168 --> 00:52:54,130
- So stand by outside my mansion, motherfuckers.
- Yeah.

1041
00:52:54,255 --> 00:52:55,399
What's the problem?

1042
00:52:55,423 --> 00:52:56,841
So apparently, it is true.

1043
00:52:58,968 --> 00:53:03,139
Yes.
I've seen the marriage license.

1044
00:53:05,600 --> 00:53:08,603
Galina Stepanovna,
please don't worry.

1045
00:53:08,728 --> 00:53:11,480
Ivan, with all due respect...

1046
00:53:11,606 --> 00:53:13,608
your father sent us.

1047
00:53:13,733 --> 00:53:15,651
Fucking Toros sent you!

1048
00:53:15,776 --> 00:53:18,988
Toros works for me! I pay him!

1049
00:53:19,113 --> 00:53:22,867
And you bring some fucking
gopnik into my home.

1050
00:53:22,992 --> 00:53:25,661
I promise,
I will fix everything.

1051
00:53:29,749 --> 00:53:32,501
Galina Stepanovna.
Yes, Galina Stepanovna.

1052
00:53:32,627 --> 00:53:36,380
I'm having your ass fired!
You're dead for this!

1053
00:53:36,505 --> 00:53:37,882
Bitch!

1054
00:53:38,007 --> 00:53:40,927
Okay, look, look.
You work for Ivan's family,

1055
00:53:41,052 --> 00:53:43,846
so I'm assuming that means
you work for him, right?

1056
00:53:43,971 --> 00:53:46,140
So if he's telling you
to take it outside,

1057
00:53:46,265 --> 00:53:47,558
fucking take it outside.

1058
00:53:47,683 --> 00:53:49,393
Fucking take it outside!
Listen to my wife.

1059
00:53:49,518 --> 00:53:50,853
Real talk!

1060
00:53:57,860 --> 00:53:59,504
- Are you kidding me?
- Everybody, so sorry.

1061
00:53:59,528 --> 00:54:00,928
I have to go.

1062
00:54:01,030 --> 00:54:03,532
I have an emergency.
Sorry about that.

1063
00:54:07,995 --> 00:54:09,675
He says we have
to stay here.

1064
00:54:09,789 --> 00:54:11,248
Move, move...

1065
00:54:11,374 --> 00:54:12,893
Move. Thank you.

1066
00:54:12,917 --> 00:54:15,878
- Wait.
- It's Toros.

1067
00:54:16,003 --> 00:54:19,006
- Hello, Toros.
- Put me on the fucking speaker

1068
00:54:19,131 --> 00:54:20,633
so this hooker
can hear me, too.

1069
00:54:20,758 --> 00:54:23,177
He just called me a hooker?

1070
00:54:23,302 --> 00:54:25,054
You're already on
speaker.

1071
00:54:25,179 --> 00:54:28,057
She's fucking
erotic dancer. Hi, Toros.

1072
00:54:28,182 --> 00:54:30,017
What did you do, Ivan?

1073
00:54:30,142 --> 00:54:31,310
What did you do?

1074
00:54:31,686 --> 00:54:33,688
I don't check in
on you

1075
00:54:33,813 --> 00:54:35,022
for two weeks

1076
00:54:35,147 --> 00:54:36,983
and you go
and marry a prostitute!

1077
00:54:37,108 --> 00:54:38,484
Fucking hell!

1078
00:54:38,609 --> 00:54:40,253
I'm not a fucking
prostitute,

1079
00:54:40,277 --> 00:54:41,277
you fucking piece of
shit.

1080
00:54:41,320 --> 00:54:42,589
Yeah, fucking Armenian
piece of shit.

1081
00:54:42,613 --> 00:54:44,699
You Armenian piece of shit!

1082
00:54:44,824 --> 00:54:46,117
Do you understand

1083
00:54:46,242 --> 00:54:47,618
how shameful this is?

1084
00:54:48,869 --> 00:54:51,664
- Toros.
- Your mother was crying, do you hear me?

1085
00:54:51,789 --> 00:54:53,499
Toros!

1086
00:54:53,624 --> 00:54:55,519
Your mother,
she never cry in her life.

1087
00:54:55,543 --> 00:54:56,711
She was crying on the phone.

1088
00:54:56,836 --> 00:54:58,212
- Toros!
- Shame on you!

1089
00:54:58,337 --> 00:55:00,047
- Fuck you! Blyat!
- Ivan.

1090
00:55:00,172 --> 00:55:01,674
Fucking faggot.

1091
00:55:01,799 --> 00:55:03,175
And guess what?

1092
00:55:03,300 --> 00:55:05,094
Guess what, you little shit!

1093
00:55:05,219 --> 00:55:06,762
And what? Surprise me!

1094
00:55:06,887 --> 00:55:09,181
You really did it this time.

1095
00:55:09,306 --> 00:55:10,306
What?

1096
00:55:10,641 --> 00:55:12,393
Your parents are on their way!

1097
00:55:12,518 --> 00:55:13,644
Your parents are on the way.

1098
00:55:13,769 --> 00:55:15,229
Can you hear me?

1099
00:55:15,354 --> 00:55:16,230
To where?

1100
00:55:16,355 --> 00:55:18,816
Here. Where else? Here!

1101
00:55:19,525 --> 00:55:22,862
Coming to pick you up
like a naughty school boy,

1102
00:55:22,987 --> 00:55:24,363
you hear me?

1103
00:55:24,488 --> 00:55:26,407
We're meeting them
tomorrow at noon.

1104
00:55:26,532 --> 00:55:28,510
Vanya,
what the fuck is going on?

1105
00:55:28,534 --> 00:55:30,619
They're taking
you back to Russia,

1106
00:55:30,745 --> 00:55:32,288
so start packing.

1107
00:55:32,413 --> 00:55:34,558
Ivan, what
the fuck? What does that mean?

1108
00:55:34,582 --> 00:55:36,292
Do you understand?

1109
00:55:37,334 --> 00:55:39,003
Game over for you. That's it.

1110
00:55:39,128 --> 00:55:40,838
Vanya, we are married.

1111
00:55:40,963 --> 00:55:42,423
They're gonna
have to accept that.

1112
00:55:42,548 --> 00:55:44,091
- Yeah, I know!
- Yes.

1113
00:55:44,216 --> 00:55:46,302
Accept that?

1114
00:55:46,427 --> 00:55:48,679
That's funny. Sure, yeah.

1115
00:55:49,263 --> 00:55:51,515
Ivan, listen to me
carefully.

1116
00:55:51,932 --> 00:55:54,560
I'll be there in ten minutes.

1117
00:55:54,685 --> 00:55:57,938
You and your whore
are coming with me.

1118
00:55:58,064 --> 00:55:59,523
Whore?

1119
00:55:59,940 --> 00:56:01,918
Your mother is a
fucking...

1120
00:56:01,942 --> 00:56:04,320
- Who the fuck is this guy?
- Hey! I'm gonna be there

1121
00:56:04,445 --> 00:56:05,905
in ten minutes, you hear me?

1122
00:56:06,030 --> 00:56:08,365
In ten minutes, both of you
are coming with me

1123
00:56:08,491 --> 00:56:09,992
down to the city hall.

1124
00:56:10,117 --> 00:56:11,660
We're gonna annul
this marriage.

1125
00:56:11,786 --> 00:56:14,288
Do you hear me? This marriage
is gonna be annulled!

1126
00:56:14,413 --> 00:56:17,583
Oh, I am not going
fucking anywhere.

1127
00:56:17,708 --> 00:56:20,461
We are not getting a divorce
because you tell us to!

1128
00:56:20,586 --> 00:56:22,004
Go fuck yourself!

1129
00:56:22,129 --> 00:56:24,173
You go fuck yourself.
How about that?

1130
00:56:24,298 --> 00:56:26,050
Me go fuck myself?
Me fuck myself?

1131
00:56:26,175 --> 00:56:28,636
You go fuck yourself and your
fucking mother, motherfucker!

1132
00:56:28,761 --> 00:56:30,429
Shut the fuck up!
Shut the fuck up!

1133
00:56:30,554 --> 00:56:32,223
You don't even know
who the fuck I am.

1134
00:56:32,348 --> 00:56:34,642
Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop.
Toros, Toros, uh...

1135
00:56:34,767 --> 00:56:35,952
You said my
parents

1136
00:56:35,976 --> 00:56:38,229
are on their way to
America?

1137
00:56:38,354 --> 00:56:40,773
Yes, yes. Are you deaf?

1138
00:56:40,898 --> 00:56:42,900
They are leaving Russia
in an hour.

1139
00:56:43,025 --> 00:56:45,145
Tomorrow, noon, we're gonna
go meet them, you hear me?

1140
00:56:45,194 --> 00:56:46,737
- What the fuck is going on?
- Come on.

1141
00:56:46,862 --> 00:56:48,405
- Come on?
- Come on, come on, come on.

1142
00:56:48,531 --> 00:56:50,074
Why do we have to leave
the house?

1143
00:56:50,199 --> 00:56:52,039
They can't just fucking
come in here like that.

1144
00:56:52,076 --> 00:56:55,472
- Excuse me. Get the fuck away from me, please.
- Toros will be here in ten minutes.

1145
00:56:55,496 --> 00:56:57,998
Garnik,
shut that bitch up, please.

1146
00:56:58,124 --> 00:56:59,684
- Where are we going, Ivan?
- Ivan, Ivan...

1147
00:56:59,708 --> 00:57:01,752
I don't know where
are we going, but we are going.

1148
00:57:01,877 --> 00:57:03,129
Where is he going?

1149
00:57:03,254 --> 00:57:05,297
Why do we have to leave,
and why are they staying?

1150
00:57:05,422 --> 00:57:07,049
- Ivan...
- That doesn't make any sense.

1151
00:57:07,174 --> 00:57:09,694
- Ivan, where are you going?
- We should call the fucking police or something.

1152
00:57:09,718 --> 00:57:11,446
In ten minutes,
Toros will be here...

1153
00:57:11,470 --> 00:57:12,470
- Vanya.
- Garnik!

1154
00:57:12,513 --> 00:57:13,722
Did he say he's leaving?

1155
00:57:13,848 --> 00:57:15,617
- Ivan! We...
- Let's go, let's go, let's go!

1156
00:57:15,641 --> 00:57:17,281
Okay! I need to get dressed, though!

1157
00:57:17,393 --> 00:57:19,454
No, no. Let's do
this, let's wait for Toros.

1158
00:57:19,478 --> 00:57:21,164
My fucking clothes
are upstairs. Fuck!

1159
00:57:21,188 --> 00:57:23,291
- Garnik, get him. Garnik, don't let him leave.
- Where the fuck...

1160
00:57:23,315 --> 00:57:25,252
- Vanya, wait.
- Toros will arrive in ten minutes.

1161
00:57:25,276 --> 00:57:26,419
Give me one fucking minute.

1162
00:57:26,443 --> 00:57:28,737
Stop, stop. Where are you going?
No. We have no time.

1163
00:57:28,863 --> 00:57:31,216
- I have to get dressed, Ivan.
- I have no fucking pants on.

1164
00:57:31,240 --> 00:57:32,283
- Oh, God.
- Okay, bye.

1165
00:57:32,408 --> 00:57:34,177
Did he say bye?

1166
00:57:34,201 --> 00:57:35,971
What the fuck? Are you fucking kidding me?

1167
00:57:35,995 --> 00:57:38,140
Did he say bye?
Keep her here. Ivan!

1168
00:57:38,164 --> 00:57:39,349
Oh, my fucking God!

1169
00:57:39,373 --> 00:57:40,892
- Garnik!
- Ivan, what the fuck?!

1170
00:57:40,916 --> 00:57:42,585
Whoa. Uh...

1171
00:57:42,710 --> 00:57:44,253
Get the fuck out of my way.

1172
00:57:45,588 --> 00:57:47,798
Ivan!

1173
00:57:47,923 --> 00:57:50,050
Get the fuck out of
my fucking way, motherfucker.

1174
00:57:50,176 --> 00:57:51,969
- But you...
- Do not fucking touch me!

1175
00:57:52,094 --> 00:57:53,512
No. No, no, no.

1176
00:57:53,637 --> 00:57:54,680
Stop!

1177
00:57:55,097 --> 00:57:57,892
Ivan! Ivan!

1178
00:57:58,017 --> 00:57:59,435
...fucking touch
me!

1179
00:57:59,560 --> 00:58:01,604
- Relax. Relax. It's okay.
- You fucking relax.

1180
00:58:01,729 --> 00:58:04,440
What is happening?
Somebody talk to me, please!

1181
00:58:04,565 --> 00:58:05,750
Don't you touch me,
motherfucker!

1182
00:58:05,774 --> 00:58:06,609
No, just...

1183
00:58:06,734 --> 00:58:08,277
What the fuck
is wrong with you?

1184
00:58:08,402 --> 00:58:09,562
- Relax. Whoa.
- Motherfucker!

1185
00:58:09,653 --> 00:58:10,839
Everything all right?

1186
00:58:10,863 --> 00:58:11,906
What?

1187
00:58:12,406 --> 00:58:13,991
Fucking
impressive.

1188
00:58:15,201 --> 00:58:16,595
- Okay...
- Stay the fuck back!

1189
00:58:16,619 --> 00:58:18,454
No, no. What?
No, no, no, no, no!

1190
00:58:18,579 --> 00:58:20,247
Put it. It's-it's bad way.

1191
00:58:20,372 --> 00:58:21,932
- Wha... Just sit.
- I fucking dare you.

1192
00:58:21,957 --> 00:58:23,476
Take another fucking step, motherfucker.

1193
00:58:23,500 --> 00:58:25,294
No. Just... I don't...
I don't touch you.

1194
00:58:25,419 --> 00:58:27,171
No, no, no, no, no, no!
Don't leave.

1195
00:58:27,296 --> 00:58:28,422
It's okay.

1196
00:58:28,547 --> 00:58:30,132
Uh, just put it... Whoa!

1197
00:58:30,257 --> 00:58:32,092
Stop.

1198
00:58:33,010 --> 00:58:35,512
Please stop.

1199
00:58:35,638 --> 00:58:38,015
Stop, please.

1200
00:58:38,140 --> 00:58:39,975
No, no. Stop.

1201
00:58:42,728 --> 00:58:45,606
Stop. Stop, please.

1202
00:58:45,731 --> 00:58:47,274
Garnik, what are you doing?

1203
00:58:47,399 --> 00:58:49,359
Are you killing her?

1204
00:58:49,443 --> 00:58:50,643
- Stop it!
- Fuck!

1205
00:58:50,736 --> 00:58:52,505
Ivan throwing another one
of his tantrums, huh?

1206
00:58:53,864 --> 00:58:56,408
Hold on. It's okay.

1207
00:58:58,118 --> 00:59:00,287
If you don't
stop...

1208
00:59:00,412 --> 00:59:01,747
I will tie you up!

1209
00:59:02,498 --> 00:59:04,708
You're not tying
me up, motherfucker!

1210
00:59:11,257 --> 00:59:14,051
Get the fuck off me!

1211
00:59:17,388 --> 00:59:20,516
You are fucking insane.

1212
00:59:21,517 --> 00:59:24,019
Hey. Hey!

1213
00:59:24,144 --> 00:59:26,188
Help me! He's attacking me.

1214
00:59:26,313 --> 00:59:28,193
What the fuck
are you doing to her, bro?

1215
00:59:28,232 --> 00:59:30,484
Get the fuck off me!
Somebody help! Get him off me!

1216
00:59:30,609 --> 00:59:33,070
What do you mean?
You wanted me to keep her here

1217
00:59:33,195 --> 00:59:34,195
so I'm keeping her here.

1218
00:59:34,238 --> 00:59:35,114
Yes, but why

1219
00:59:35,239 --> 00:59:36,282
are you tying her up?

1220
00:59:36,407 --> 00:59:38,284
But she got fucking crazy,

1221
00:59:38,409 --> 00:59:39,702
started jumping all around.

1222
00:59:39,827 --> 00:59:42,180
- Help me!
- What else could I do?

1223
00:59:42,204 --> 00:59:44,057
Why are you just
fucking standing there?

1224
00:59:44,081 --> 00:59:46,161
Igor, what the
fuck are you doing, man?

1225
00:59:46,834 --> 00:59:49,003
She threw the candlestick at me.

1226
00:59:49,128 --> 00:59:50,504
Let's tie her legs.

1227
00:59:50,629 --> 00:59:53,924
No, no, no, no!
Please, please, please, please don't.

1228
00:59:54,049 --> 00:59:56,135
We are not doing
that, let her go!

1229
00:59:56,260 --> 00:59:59,972
Let me go, you fucking asshole.
Goddamn fucking bastard.

1230
01:00:00,097 --> 01:00:02,391
She will run, bro.
I promise.

1231
01:00:02,516 --> 01:00:04,685
Where will she run?

1232
01:00:04,810 --> 01:00:06,895
We're two grown men here.
Are you out of your mind?

1233
01:00:12,276 --> 01:00:13,694
Okay.

1234
01:00:20,367 --> 01:00:23,162
- You crazy motherfucker!
- Hey.

1235
01:00:23,287 --> 01:00:24,997
You better stay the fuck
away from me!

1236
01:00:25,122 --> 01:00:27,333
Stop, stop. Listen.
You are not going anywhere.

1237
01:00:27,458 --> 01:00:29,126
Come back. Please come...

1238
01:00:29,251 --> 01:00:30,669
She will run
away!

1239
01:00:30,794 --> 01:00:31,628
Really?

1240
01:00:31,754 --> 01:00:33,005
Hey, stop.

1241
01:00:33,130 --> 01:00:34,548
Get her!

1242
01:00:37,051 --> 01:00:39,470
Get the fuck off
me!

1243
01:00:42,598 --> 01:00:45,225
Put me down, motherfucker!

1244
01:00:47,311 --> 01:00:48,311
Fuck!

1245
01:00:54,526 --> 01:00:58,030
- What the fuck, man!
- She's biting, man.

1246
01:00:58,155 --> 01:00:59,365
Fucker!

1247
01:00:59,490 --> 01:01:01,075
C'mon, tie her
legs.

1248
01:01:01,200 --> 01:01:02,493
What? How?

1249
01:01:02,618 --> 01:01:04,203
You motherfucker! Fuck!

1250
01:01:04,328 --> 01:01:06,097
- What do you mean how?
- Somehow, dude!

1251
01:01:06,121 --> 01:01:08,332
Fucking motherfucker.
You fucking asshole.

1252
01:01:08,457 --> 01:01:09,737
With fucking what?

1253
01:01:09,833 --> 01:01:11,853
- Use anything!
- No, no. Don't, don't.

1254
01:01:11,877 --> 01:01:14,064
- That cord!
- No, no, don't. I don't...

1255
01:01:14,088 --> 01:01:15,881
I don't even know
what is going on here.

1256
01:01:16,006 --> 01:01:18,526
I didn't do anything. Don't tie me.
I'm not gonna run. I promise.

1257
01:01:18,550 --> 01:01:21,220
I'm calm. I'm not gonna do anything.
I'm not gonna run away.

1258
01:01:21,345 --> 01:01:23,931
- What?
- You do not need to tie me.

1259
01:01:24,056 --> 01:01:25,825
Are you fucking
kidding, tie her!

1260
01:01:25,849 --> 01:01:28,244
No, you-you motherfucker.
You don't need to tie me.

1261
01:01:28,268 --> 01:01:30,308
- Calm down. Listen, listen.
- I am calm. I am calm.

1262
01:01:30,354 --> 01:01:32,999
Ivan's father wants this marriage annulled.
You're staying here and getting this annulled.

1263
01:01:33,023 --> 01:01:34,066
You heard my boss.

1264
01:01:36,026 --> 01:01:37,653
Fuck your boss.

1265
01:01:37,778 --> 01:01:40,030
I swear to fucking
God!

1266
01:01:40,364 --> 01:01:42,950
Garnik, you stupid fucking idiot!

1267
01:01:43,659 --> 01:01:45,077
Oh fuck.

1268
01:01:45,202 --> 01:01:48,789
I just
want to know what is going on.

1269
01:01:48,914 --> 01:01:51,291
Someone fucking tell me
what's going on.

1270
01:01:51,417 --> 01:01:53,252
I'm not gonna run. Let me go.

1271
01:01:53,377 --> 01:01:55,045
Damn, it's broken.

1272
01:01:55,379 --> 01:01:57,589
I think she broke my nose.

1273
01:01:57,714 --> 01:02:00,134
Yeah. I'm glad I
broke your fucking nose!

1274
01:02:00,259 --> 01:02:02,511
You fucking bitch,
you broke my nose!

1275
01:02:02,636 --> 01:02:04,572
Yeah? Next time, I'll kick you
in the fucking balls!

1276
01:02:04,596 --> 01:02:06,276
- God, let me go!
- Hold her.

1277
01:02:06,390 --> 01:02:08,493
Garnik,
you fucking idiot, talk to me!

1278
01:02:08,517 --> 01:02:10,412
- Fucking untie me, motherfucker!
- Hello? Garnik?

1279
01:02:10,436 --> 01:02:12,163
Hold on a minute,
Toros. Hold on.

1280
01:02:12,187 --> 01:02:13,907
You fucking
piece of shit.

1281
01:02:13,981 --> 01:02:15,023
Hold on?

1282
01:02:15,149 --> 01:02:16,793
Fucking
psycho. Fucking untie me.

1283
01:02:16,817 --> 01:02:18,610
C'mon man, hold
on! Fuck.

1284
01:02:18,735 --> 01:02:21,464
- I am not fighting.
- Garnik, I swear, if you fucked

1285
01:02:21,488 --> 01:02:23,383
this up. Garnik! Motherfucker...

1286
01:02:23,407 --> 01:02:26,803
Untie me. I am not fighting.
I'm not gonna run. Just fucking untie me.

1287
01:02:30,414 --> 01:02:32,749
No.

1288
01:02:32,875 --> 01:02:34,084
Don't let her go.

1289
01:02:34,209 --> 01:02:35,419
I swear...

1290
01:02:35,544 --> 01:02:38,088
Oh, you are so
fucked.

1291
01:02:38,213 --> 01:02:39,756
You're going to prison.

1292
01:02:39,882 --> 01:02:41,383
Where's your ice?

1293
01:02:41,508 --> 01:02:43,677
I can't wait until Ivan sees
what you did to me.

1294
01:02:43,802 --> 01:02:45,971
Rich people don't have ice?

1295
01:02:47,055 --> 01:02:50,517
Ivan did just leave the house.

1296
01:02:50,642 --> 01:02:52,019
He did not leave.

1297
01:02:52,144 --> 01:02:54,271
He is going to get help.

1298
01:02:55,647 --> 01:02:57,524
I-I don't think so.

1299
01:02:59,526 --> 01:03:00,777
Garnik!

1300
01:03:00,903 --> 01:03:02,446
You fucking asshole.

1301
01:03:02,571 --> 01:03:04,406
Yeah, I bet you like this, huh?

1302
01:03:04,531 --> 01:03:06,867
Yeah, you like this,
you sick fuck?

1303
01:03:06,992 --> 01:03:08,827
I bet you get off on this.

1304
01:03:08,952 --> 01:03:10,746
Fucking psycho.

1305
01:03:10,871 --> 01:03:13,248
Tor, where are you?

1306
01:03:13,373 --> 01:03:15,042
Here, you donkey
fucker.

1307
01:03:15,167 --> 01:03:16,460
Open the gate.

1308
01:03:16,585 --> 01:03:17,937
Okay, sir, but Ivan just...

1309
01:03:17,961 --> 01:03:19,171
Open the fucking gate!

1310
01:03:19,296 --> 01:03:22,508
I am not fighting. Let me go.

1311
01:03:22,633 --> 01:03:24,176
No.

1312
01:03:24,301 --> 01:03:26,970
You are not going anywhere.

1313
01:03:27,095 --> 01:03:29,157
Don't let her go
under any circumstances.

1314
01:03:29,181 --> 01:03:31,433
You two are
fucking dead for this!

1315
01:03:31,558 --> 01:03:33,852
I am Ivan's fucking wife!

1316
01:03:38,732 --> 01:03:40,400
Vanya?

1317
01:03:47,950 --> 01:03:50,786
Oh, are you the Armenian
fuck I was talking to?

1318
01:03:51,745 --> 01:03:53,121
What the fuck is happening?

1319
01:03:53,247 --> 01:03:54,998
Is this the big fucking boss?

1320
01:03:55,123 --> 01:03:56,851
- What happened here?
- She happened.

1321
01:03:56,875 --> 01:03:57,918
Hey, mister.

1322
01:03:58,043 --> 01:03:59,711
Can you fucking tell this guy
to untie me?

1323
01:03:59,836 --> 01:04:01,481
- What?
- Yeah, she did this.

1324
01:04:01,505 --> 01:04:02,732
- Hello.
- Where is Ivan?

1325
01:04:02,756 --> 01:04:03,966
Ivan run away.

1326
01:04:04,091 --> 01:04:06,718
- Why the fuck is no one an...
- Run away?

1327
01:04:06,843 --> 01:04:08,404
- Excuse me, sir. Hello.
- You didn't stop him?

1328
01:04:08,428 --> 01:04:10,847
I-I tried, but then, uh, there was, uh, ice on
the floor.

1329
01:04:10,973 --> 01:04:12,641
- I tried to stop him.
- Hello!

1330
01:04:12,766 --> 01:04:13,826
- You tried?
- Hello!

1331
01:04:13,850 --> 01:04:15,995
- Somebody fucking listen to me.
- You tried? You don't try.

1332
01:04:16,019 --> 01:04:17,980
You just grab the guy.
What do you mean you tried?

1333
01:04:18,105 --> 01:04:20,065
- What do you mean? I'm not a...
- So he's gone?

1334
01:04:20,190 --> 01:04:21,793
I'm not allowed to touch
that motherfucker.

1335
01:04:21,817 --> 01:04:23,211
- Excuse me! Hello!
- Shut the fuck up!

1336
01:04:23,235 --> 01:04:25,988
No, you fucking let me go.
Tell this guy to fucking let me go.

1337
01:04:26,113 --> 01:04:28,383
What were you
doing? Why did you let him leave?

1338
01:04:28,407 --> 01:04:30,552
Are you the boss?
You're the fucking boss?

1339
01:04:30,576 --> 01:04:32,576
What? He told me not to touch
the guy

1340
01:04:32,661 --> 01:04:36,221
- Tell him to fucking let me go.
- and I was dealing with her.

1341
01:04:36,290 --> 01:04:38,518
Fucking... Excuse me.
Fucking motherfuckers.

1342
01:04:38,542 --> 01:04:40,395
- Please leave your message...
- He doesn't answer.

1343
01:04:40,419 --> 01:04:43,022
- He doesn't pick up.
- Hey, fuck face.

1344
01:04:43,046 --> 01:04:44,857
Of course
he's not going to answer.

1345
01:04:44,881 --> 01:04:47,151
Can you tell this
motherfucker to let me go?

1346
01:04:47,175 --> 01:04:49,386
Why is she on top of you, man?
Wh-Wh-What's going on?

1347
01:04:49,511 --> 01:04:52,347
I don't know what's going on.
Can you please tell him to untie me?

1348
01:04:52,472 --> 01:04:55,058
- Why is she sitting on you?
- I'm holding her!

1349
01:04:55,183 --> 01:04:56,661
Put-put her down, please.

1350
01:04:56,685 --> 01:04:58,580
- No, don't do that.
- Yes, fucking put me down.

1351
01:04:58,604 --> 01:04:59,605
No, don't do that.

1352
01:04:59,730 --> 01:05:01,490
Tell him to fucking
put me down, please.

1353
01:05:01,565 --> 01:05:02,399
Put her down.

1354
01:05:02,524 --> 01:05:04,085
- Why you holding her like that?
- Ow.

1355
01:05:04,109 --> 01:05:05,878
- No, no, no. Be careful, bro.
- Fuck. Fuck!

1356
01:05:05,902 --> 01:05:07,297
- Be careful.
- Why...

1357
01:05:07,321 --> 01:05:09,364
Hey, now can you tell him
to fucking untie me?

1358
01:05:09,489 --> 01:05:11,369
Why did you... Why...
Why did you tie her hands?

1359
01:05:11,450 --> 01:05:12,492
- Untie me.
- Look.

1360
01:05:12,618 --> 01:05:15,763
- What, you afraid of this little girl?
- Can you tell him to fucking untie me?

1361
01:05:15,787 --> 01:05:18,266
- She's an animal.
- She's a fucking little girl! So, she...

1362
01:05:18,290 --> 01:05:20,268
- She beat you both up?
- She's not fighting like one.

1363
01:05:20,292 --> 01:05:22,437
- I'm gonna get my phone.
- Can you untie her?

1364
01:05:22,461 --> 01:05:25,523
- If you untie her, I'm just leaving, bro.
- This is ridiculous, man. Untie her.

1365
01:05:25,547 --> 01:05:27,525
- It's embarrassing.
- She will start swinging again. Don't do that.

1366
01:05:27,549 --> 01:05:29,949
I can untie her
but you won't get what you need

1367
01:05:30,052 --> 01:05:32,196
- because she's out of control.
- Fuck you.

1368
01:05:32,220 --> 01:05:34,407
- She's an animal, bro. Trust me.
- No, these guys

1369
01:05:34,431 --> 01:05:36,159
- are fucking liars.
- Okay, listen to me.

1370
01:05:36,183 --> 01:05:38,244
Where is your phone? Can you
please give me your phone?

1371
01:05:38,268 --> 01:05:42,439
My phone is in the other room. I will go get my
phone if you untie me. I need you to untie me.

1372
01:05:42,564 --> 01:05:45,418
Where? Which other room? Over there? Can-can
you... Go grab her phone, please.

1373
01:05:45,442 --> 01:05:48,630
No, I will get my phone.
I'll get my phone, and I'll call Vanya.

1374
01:05:48,654 --> 01:05:51,415
- I will untie you. Give me a minute.
- No! No, don't do that!

1375
01:05:51,448 --> 01:05:54,534
- I just need your phone to call Ivan.
- I know, and I will get my phone.

1376
01:05:54,660 --> 01:05:56,596
I'm telling you to get the fucking
phone!

1377
01:05:56,620 --> 01:05:58,389
Let's just calm down for one second.

1378
01:05:58,413 --> 01:06:00,683
- Careful.
- Calm down for a second. Just calm down.

1379
01:06:00,707 --> 01:06:03,707
- I am calm. I'm not fucking moving.
- And listen to me. Okay, look, we have

1380
01:06:03,752 --> 01:06:05,021
an emergency here.
It's very important.

1381
01:06:05,045 --> 01:06:07,923
Okay, I need you to cooperate.
I'm begging you.

1382
01:06:08,048 --> 01:06:09,549
Your guys came in here.

1383
01:06:09,675 --> 01:06:11,510
They chased Ivan out
of the fucking house.

1384
01:06:11,635 --> 01:06:13,553
They fucking tied me.
They attacked me.

1385
01:06:13,679 --> 01:06:16,306
That motherfucker was making me
sit on his fucking lap.

1386
01:06:16,431 --> 01:06:17,933
Your guys are fucking crazy.

1387
01:06:18,058 --> 01:06:21,186
I-I'm terribly sorry
it went down that way, okay?

1388
01:06:21,311 --> 01:06:23,271
I'm terribly sorry.

1389
01:06:24,564 --> 01:06:26,441
But now we have to just
call him, okay?

1390
01:06:26,566 --> 01:06:28,527
Here. Help me, please.

1391
01:06:29,736 --> 01:06:31,071
He's-he's on your phone?

1392
01:06:31,196 --> 01:06:32,572
Yeah, it's under "husband."

1393
01:06:32,698 --> 01:06:34,032
Okay. Yep.

1394
01:06:34,157 --> 01:06:35,659
"Husband."

1395
01:06:35,784 --> 01:06:37,160
Here we go.

1396
01:06:39,162 --> 01:06:41,039
Please leave your message...

1397
01:06:41,164 --> 01:06:42,416
It goes to voicemail.

1398
01:06:42,541 --> 01:06:44,418
That's a fucking great
husband you have.

1399
01:06:44,543 --> 01:06:47,421
First ditches you,
now doesn't answer your calls.

1400
01:06:47,546 --> 01:06:50,006
Real marriage my ass, man.

1401
01:06:50,132 --> 01:06:51,466
He's flown the
coop.

1402
01:06:51,591 --> 01:06:53,343
Fucking little piece of shit.

1403
01:06:53,468 --> 01:06:55,303
I don't know what
kind of...

1404
01:06:55,429 --> 01:06:57,264
fucked-up family shit
is going on here,

1405
01:06:57,389 --> 01:06:59,599
but Ivan and I
are married, okay?

1406
01:06:59,725 --> 01:07:03,311
This is a real marriage,
and I'm not getting a divorce.

1407
01:07:07,399 --> 01:07:09,025
This is not a real marriage.

1408
01:07:09,151 --> 01:07:10,402
This is a real marriage.

1409
01:07:10,527 --> 01:07:11,945
Okay, and we're
getting it annulled,

1410
01:07:12,070 --> 01:07:13,905
and you have no say in it.

1411
01:07:14,030 --> 01:07:15,110
Well, I'm his fucking wife,

1412
01:07:15,198 --> 01:07:17,617
so I do think
I have a say in it.

1413
01:07:17,743 --> 01:07:19,387
Absolutely not.
Listen to what I'm telling you.

1414
01:07:19,411 --> 01:07:20,996
You got married illegally,

1415
01:07:21,121 --> 01:07:22,914
it's a fraud marriage,
and we're

1416
01:07:23,039 --> 01:07:25,125
- getting it annulled A.S.A.P.
- A fraud marriage?

1417
01:07:25,250 --> 01:07:29,337
No, we are two consenting
adults who got married legally,

1418
01:07:29,463 --> 01:07:31,383
and there is nothing
you can fucking do about it.

1419
01:07:31,423 --> 01:07:32,924
No, this is Ivan
just fooling around!

1420
01:07:33,049 --> 01:07:34,801
- Would you get over it?
- No, it's not.

1421
01:07:34,926 --> 01:07:36,803
- You have no fucking idea.
- Oh, yeah?

1422
01:07:36,928 --> 01:07:38,346
When'd you guys meet, huh?

1423
01:07:38,472 --> 01:07:40,307
- When did you meet him?
- Strip club.

1424
01:07:40,432 --> 01:07:43,101
I am telling you,
you do not know this guy.

1425
01:07:43,226 --> 01:07:44,394
I do know him.

1426
01:07:44,519 --> 01:07:46,438
You do not know this guy,
I'm telling you.

1427
01:07:46,563 --> 01:07:48,690
- Oh, I know my husband. I do.
- No, you don't.

1428
01:07:48,815 --> 01:07:51,415
It's classic Ivan. I've been dealing with his shit
since he was...

1429
01:07:51,526 --> 01:07:53,045
- he was six years old.
- Classic Ivan.

1430
01:07:53,069 --> 01:07:54,696
And now his parents
are gonna kill me,

1431
01:07:54,821 --> 01:07:57,699
and my fucking family
will never talk to me again.

1432
01:07:58,784 --> 01:08:00,619
Little bastard.

1433
01:08:00,744 --> 01:08:02,805
And you left the baptism
half way because of this guy.

1434
01:08:02,829 --> 01:08:04,664
- Tell me about it.
- Oh my God.

1435
01:08:04,790 --> 01:08:06,166
I love my husband,

1436
01:08:06,291 --> 01:08:08,835
and I plan on being with him
forever.

1437
01:08:08,960 --> 01:08:10,504
No, don't give me
that bullshit.

1438
01:08:10,629 --> 01:08:12,881
Do not give me that bullshit.
You don't love him.

1439
01:08:13,006 --> 01:08:15,634
You do not love him,
and he doesn't love you.

1440
01:08:15,759 --> 01:08:18,011
You understand?
That's in your head.

1441
01:08:19,137 --> 01:08:21,681
I can't wait to have
Ivan's children.

1442
01:08:21,807 --> 01:08:23,809
In fact, I think
I'm probably already pregnant.

1443
01:08:25,143 --> 01:08:26,770
I-I certainly hope
you're lying,

1444
01:08:26,895 --> 01:08:28,980
'cause we're gonna have to
take care of that, too.

1445
01:08:29,105 --> 01:08:31,233
- I promise you that.
- Oh, the-the fuck you will.

1446
01:08:31,358 --> 01:08:33,235
- Yes, we will.
- And I would like all of you

1447
01:08:33,360 --> 01:08:34,945
to fucking untie me
and leave my home,

1448
01:08:35,070 --> 01:08:37,155
- or I will be pressing charges.
- Your home?!

1449
01:08:37,280 --> 01:08:39,741
- Yeah, my home.
- This isn't Ivan's home.

1450
01:08:39,866 --> 01:08:41,868
This is his father's house.

1451
01:08:41,993 --> 01:08:44,287
Everything Ivan has
belongs to his father.

1452
01:08:44,412 --> 01:08:46,706
You understand?
Ivan has nothing.

1453
01:08:46,832 --> 01:08:49,084
You know that bedroom
you've been fucking in?

1454
01:08:49,209 --> 01:08:50,585
That's his parents' room.

1455
01:08:50,710 --> 01:08:52,420
Do you know
where is Ivan's room?

1456
01:08:52,546 --> 01:08:55,757
It's down the hall with fucking
spaceships on the walls.

1457
01:08:55,882 --> 01:08:57,509
Do you know why?

1458
01:08:57,634 --> 01:08:59,234
- Do you know why?
- Fucking tell me why.

1459
01:08:59,261 --> 01:09:00,637
You're already gonna
tell me, so...

1460
01:09:00,762 --> 01:09:02,362
Because he's a fucking child.
That's why.

1461
01:09:02,430 --> 01:09:04,182
Fucking kid.

1462
01:09:09,563 --> 01:09:11,606
You don't understand...
he's shamed his family

1463
01:09:11,731 --> 01:09:13,984
by marrying somebody like you.

1464
01:09:14,109 --> 01:09:16,278
If you think for a second
this is gonna be allowed,

1465
01:09:16,403 --> 01:09:17,696
you're dead wrong.

1466
01:09:19,489 --> 01:09:21,241
In fact, if-if you don't
help me fix this,

1467
01:09:21,366 --> 01:09:22,951
I'm gonna have you arrested.

1468
01:09:23,076 --> 01:09:24,411
Yeah.

1469
01:09:24,536 --> 01:09:26,176
- I'm gonna have you arrested.
- Arrested?

1470
01:09:26,246 --> 01:09:27,414
Yeah.

1471
01:09:27,539 --> 01:09:28,999
- That's fucking hilarious.
- Yep.

1472
01:09:29,124 --> 01:09:30,917
- Arrested for what?
- For what?

1473
01:09:31,042 --> 01:09:32,460
- Yeah.
- I'll tell you for what.

1474
01:09:32,586 --> 01:09:33,461
- Trespassing.
- "Trespassing."

1475
01:09:33,587 --> 01:09:36,047
Fraud, cheating.

1476
01:09:36,172 --> 01:09:38,341
- Theft.
- Theft?

1477
01:09:38,466 --> 01:09:40,343
- Yes, theft.
- Assault.

1478
01:09:40,468 --> 01:09:44,014
And I... actually, the picture
is very, very clear here.

1479
01:09:45,515 --> 01:09:48,393
A scheming prostitute
married Ivan, cheated...

1480
01:09:48,518 --> 01:09:50,103
cheated Ivan to marry her

1481
01:09:50,228 --> 01:09:53,023
so she can steal
from his wealthy family.

1482
01:09:53,148 --> 01:09:55,442
- That's it.
- Mm-hmm. Definitely.

1483
01:09:55,567 --> 01:09:57,670
And I'm sure you already
have criminal record, so...

1484
01:09:58,945 --> 01:10:00,447
For sure happened.

1485
01:10:00,572 --> 01:10:02,574
Yeah. One, two, three,
you're in jail.

1486
01:10:02,699 --> 01:10:04,534
- Easy.
- Yep.

1487
01:10:04,659 --> 01:10:06,369
Ivan proposed to me.

1488
01:10:06,494 --> 01:10:08,204
He wanted to get married.

1489
01:10:08,330 --> 01:10:09,956
He put a fucking ring
on my finger.

1490
01:10:10,081 --> 01:10:11,684
- Do you see this shit?
- What ring?

1491
01:10:11,708 --> 01:10:13,543
He bought me
a fucking four-carat ring.

1492
01:10:13,668 --> 01:10:15,308
Does this look real to you, motherfucker?

1493
01:10:15,420 --> 01:10:17,660
Bet you've never seen one
of these before, have you, huh?

1494
01:10:17,756 --> 01:10:19,633
Take that ring off
her finger.

1495
01:10:19,758 --> 01:10:21,569
- No. No.
- Take it off.

1496
01:10:21,593 --> 01:10:23,529
This is my fucking
ring Ivan gave me.

1497
01:10:23,553 --> 01:10:26,157
- Give me that fucking ring.
- I am not giving you the fucking ring.

1498
01:10:26,181 --> 01:10:28,910
- Why? Take that fucking ring off!
- You touch me,

1499
01:10:28,934 --> 01:10:31,037
and I will fucking scream, motherfucker.
Do not come for me.

1500
01:10:31,061 --> 01:10:33,080
Get that fucking ring off of her.

1501
01:10:33,104 --> 01:10:34,790
- - Be careful.
- Hold the legs.

1502
01:10:34,814 --> 01:10:35,941
Careful, bro!

1503
01:10:40,528 --> 01:10:42,489
This is Zakharov's property.

1504
01:10:42,614 --> 01:10:45,075
- Fuck you! Fuck you!
- Shut up. Shut up.

1505
01:10:45,200 --> 01:10:46,952
Rape!

1506
01:10:47,077 --> 01:10:48,677
Hey, hey, don't scream.

1507
01:10:48,787 --> 01:10:49,947
Hey, what-what is she saying?

1508
01:10:49,996 --> 01:10:52,374
- Rape! Rape!
- Shut up. Shut the fuck up.

1509
01:10:52,499 --> 01:10:53,875
Is she saying, "Rape"?
Is she...

1510
01:10:54,000 --> 01:10:55,460
What? What? Shut up!

1511
01:10:55,585 --> 01:10:56,878
She bites!

1512
01:10:57,003 --> 01:10:58,296
Ouch!

1513
01:10:58,421 --> 01:11:00,061
Don't go
near to her.

1514
01:11:00,131 --> 01:11:01,291
Shut her mouth!

1515
01:11:01,341 --> 01:11:02,781
Somebody is going to call the
police!

1516
01:11:02,842 --> 01:11:04,511
- How?
- You got to shut her up!

1517
01:11:04,636 --> 01:11:06,846
- How? I need a rag or something!
- Motherfucker!

1518
01:11:06,972 --> 01:11:08,366
Shut the
fuck up.

1519
01:11:08,390 --> 01:11:10,517
Stop screaming.

1520
01:11:10,642 --> 01:11:12,769
Please stop screaming.

1521
01:11:12,894 --> 01:11:16,856
Please stop screaming!

1522
01:11:46,261 --> 01:11:48,138
You get us
in front of that judge

1523
01:11:48,263 --> 01:11:49,764
first thing in the morning,

1524
01:11:49,889 --> 01:11:51,850
or the family cuts ties
with your firm.

1525
01:11:51,975 --> 01:11:53,935
Simple as that.

1526
01:11:54,978 --> 01:11:56,146
No, no... no trying.

1527
01:11:58,690 --> 01:12:00,817
Everything will be okay.

1528
01:12:07,240 --> 01:12:08,324
Yeah.

1529
01:12:16,082 --> 01:12:18,918
Time to break this
bitch. Let's go.

1530
01:12:32,182 --> 01:12:34,059
You calm now?

1531
01:12:35,268 --> 01:12:37,020
You gonna behave?

1532
01:12:40,356 --> 01:12:41,775
Careful.

1533
01:12:45,945 --> 01:12:47,530
Trust me, I know.

1534
01:12:48,656 --> 01:12:50,992
I know what you're thinking.

1535
01:12:51,117 --> 01:12:53,578
You're thinking
this little shit betrayed you.

1536
01:12:54,954 --> 01:12:57,540
Well, guess what,
he betrayed me, too, okay?

1537
01:12:57,665 --> 01:12:58,666
Me, too.

1538
01:12:58,792 --> 01:12:59,876
You see?

1539
01:13:00,001 --> 01:13:02,212
He betrayed all of us.

1540
01:13:02,337 --> 01:13:05,590
'Cause he's a spoiled brat
that doesn't want to grow up.

1541
01:13:05,715 --> 01:13:07,550
Big-time.

1542
01:13:07,675 --> 01:13:09,511
And now we're in this mess
that we have to...

1543
01:13:09,636 --> 01:13:10,762
we have to fix it together.

1544
01:13:10,887 --> 01:13:12,514
You understand?

1545
01:13:15,225 --> 01:13:17,477
But I'm gonna help you.

1546
01:13:17,602 --> 01:13:19,687
Okay? I'm gonna help you.

1547
01:13:22,023 --> 01:13:24,734
The way I see it, this is
a green card marriage.

1548
01:13:26,236 --> 01:13:29,280
Therefore, Ivan owes you
a green card marriage fee.

1549
01:13:31,574 --> 01:13:33,201
It's only fair.

1550
01:13:34,119 --> 01:13:35,578
So, once this thing
is annulled,

1551
01:13:35,703 --> 01:13:39,165
I'm gonna make sure you get
$10,000 fee in cash.

1552
01:13:40,083 --> 01:13:41,459
Hmm?

1553
01:13:42,585 --> 01:13:45,713
I'm gonna bring this down,
but no screaming, okay?

1554
01:13:45,839 --> 01:13:47,841
If you scream,
this goes right back in.

1555
01:13:47,966 --> 01:13:49,551
You understand?

1556
01:13:59,519 --> 01:14:01,688
Ten K.

1557
01:14:01,813 --> 01:14:04,190
It's as good as you're
gonna get here, honey.

1558
01:14:06,484 --> 01:14:08,153
What do you say?

1559
01:14:12,991 --> 01:14:15,410
I want to talk to Ivan
before agreeing to any of this.

1560
01:14:15,535 --> 01:14:17,662
Sure. Of course.

1561
01:14:17,787 --> 01:14:19,414
We all want to talk to Ivan.

1562
01:14:19,539 --> 01:14:21,291
We want the same thing.

1563
01:14:28,715 --> 01:14:31,092
Okay, so let's
fucking find Ivan.

1564
01:14:31,217 --> 01:14:32,886
All right, but look at me.

1565
01:14:33,011 --> 01:14:34,804
Look at me.

1566
01:14:36,514 --> 01:14:39,767
Once we find Ivan...
which we will...

1567
01:14:39,893 --> 01:14:43,563
and we get this thing
annulled... which we will...

1568
01:14:43,688 --> 01:14:45,732
you're gonna walk away
with ten K fee

1569
01:14:45,857 --> 01:14:48,026
and never, ever
contact Ivan again.

1570
01:14:48,151 --> 01:14:49,402
Is that understood?

1571
01:14:54,616 --> 01:14:55,867
Fine.

1572
01:15:00,663 --> 01:15:01,998
Untie her.

1573
01:15:02,123 --> 01:15:05,043
You got their
marriage license and passport?

1574
01:15:33,571 --> 01:15:35,240
Excuse me,
I have to get dressed.

1575
01:15:35,365 --> 01:15:37,283
Can I have some privacy, please?

1576
01:15:45,500 --> 01:15:47,502
Anora Mikheeva?

1577
01:15:47,627 --> 01:15:49,587
Ani. It's Ani.

1578
01:15:49,712 --> 01:15:51,089
It says Anora.

1579
01:15:51,214 --> 01:15:52,924
I know, but I go by Ani.

1580
01:15:53,049 --> 01:15:54,634
- Thank you.
- Okay, get in.

1581
01:15:54,759 --> 01:15:56,052
So I'm done?

1582
01:15:56,177 --> 01:15:59,389
You're with us
until we find him. Get in.

1583
01:16:03,226 --> 01:16:05,329
Wait, why is...
why is he getting back here?

1584
01:16:05,353 --> 01:16:08,499
- I'm not sitting next to this fucking psychopath.
- Can I sit in the front?

1585
01:16:08,523 --> 01:16:10,960
- You are the fucking psychopath.
- Yes, get in the front.

1586
01:16:10,984 --> 01:16:13,963
I don't want to fucking sit next to you.
I'm not getting back there with you.

1587
01:16:13,987 --> 01:16:15,027
Un-fucking-believable.

1588
01:16:15,613 --> 01:16:17,115
Klara, come here.

1589
01:16:17,782 --> 01:16:20,410
It's a bit messier
than usual today.

1590
01:16:20,535 --> 01:16:23,121
So this is for you.
No questions.

1591
01:16:30,670 --> 01:16:32,898
So you're
saying he's gonna be there?

1592
01:16:32,922 --> 01:16:34,090
I have no fucking idea.

1593
01:16:34,215 --> 01:16:35,609
He better be.

1594
01:16:35,633 --> 01:16:37,093
Okay, let's go!

1595
01:16:37,218 --> 01:16:39,470
I need to go to the hospital...

1596
01:16:40,805 --> 01:16:42,565
No, you're okay.
Don't worry about it.

1597
01:16:42,598 --> 01:16:44,243
No, I'm not, bro.

1598
01:16:44,267 --> 01:16:47,395
I feel like I have
a concussion or something.

1599
01:16:48,438 --> 01:16:50,690
- I'm sorry for what...
- Let's go!

1600
01:16:50,815 --> 01:16:52,209
Let's go! Let's go!

1601
01:16:52,233 --> 01:16:53,026
...was happening back there.

1602
01:16:53,151 --> 01:16:56,904
- How could I have imagined...
- I don't want your dude talking to me, okay?

1603
01:16:57,030 --> 01:17:00,074
Leave her the fuck alone, man!

1604
01:17:00,658 --> 01:17:03,012
My head is pounding, bro.

1605
01:17:03,036 --> 01:17:04,471
- You can't even...
- Shut it, Garnik!

1606
01:17:05,997 --> 01:17:09,310
Oh, my God, we're gonna get into a fucking
car accident with you driving like that.

1607
01:17:09,334 --> 01:17:11,312
Are you suicidal or something?
- Just shut the fuck up.

1608
01:17:11,336 --> 01:17:14,606
- You almost hit that fucking old lady.
- What do you know about driving? What do you know?

1609
01:17:14,630 --> 01:17:17,550
You shut the fuck up.
Swing by my place and I will give

1610
01:17:17,675 --> 01:17:20,112
him something so he'll stop whining.
You've been bitching and moaning

1611
01:17:20,136 --> 01:17:22,656
this entire fucking car ride about a little
fucking scratch on your face.

1612
01:17:22,680 --> 01:17:24,742
You're the biggest fucking pussy I ever met.

1613
01:17:32,148 --> 01:17:34,192
Just don't eat all
at once.

1614
01:17:39,906 --> 01:17:42,075
What the fuck?

1615
01:17:42,200 --> 01:17:43,701
Okay, let's go.
It doesn't matter.

1616
01:17:43,826 --> 01:17:45,495
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

1617
01:17:50,249 --> 01:17:51,834
A little bit faster.

1618
01:17:51,959 --> 01:17:53,628
Hurry up.

1619
01:18:03,388 --> 01:18:05,181
- Hey, Crystal.
- Hey, Ani.

1620
01:18:05,306 --> 01:18:08,684
- Hey, have you seen Vanya today?
- No, why? Is everything okay?

1621
01:18:09,352 --> 01:18:12,272
No? Uh, yeah, everything's fine.
Could you give him a call for me, please?

1622
01:18:12,647 --> 01:18:15,525
- Okay. What's going on?
- I just need you to call him.

1623
01:18:15,650 --> 01:18:18,194
- Can you do me a favor and call him?
- Um...

1624
01:18:18,319 --> 01:18:21,906
Don't ask too many questions.
Just pick up your phone and call him.

1625
01:18:22,031 --> 01:18:24,033
- Okay. Tom? Tom, Ani's here...
- Miss?

1626
01:18:24,158 --> 01:18:25,743
- Hey, Tom.
- What's up, Ani?

1627
01:18:25,868 --> 01:18:27,638
Have you seen Vanya today?

1628
01:18:27,662 --> 01:18:30,342
- I have not. No.
- Okay, has he, like, texted or called you at all?

1629
01:18:30,415 --> 01:18:33,835
- No, not at all. No.
- Okay, could you just call him right now

1630
01:18:33,960 --> 01:18:35,795
- for me?
- Wait. Who are these dudes?

1631
01:18:35,920 --> 01:18:38,482
- My friend, can you...
- It's fine. Can you call Ivan, please?

1632
01:18:38,506 --> 01:18:40,306
- Is everything okay?
- Wait, what's going on?

1633
01:18:40,341 --> 01:18:41,902
- Everything is fine.
- Why would I call Ivan?

1634
01:18:41,926 --> 01:18:45,006
- Just pick up your phone and call him.
- I'm not gonna call him. Who are you?

1635
01:18:45,054 --> 01:18:47,390
Doesn't matter who I am.
I just need you to call him.

1636
01:18:47,515 --> 01:18:50,160
It does matter. I'm not gonna give you
- my fucking phone to call Ivan.

1637
01:18:50,184 --> 01:18:52,645
Listen. Ivan is in a lot of trouble. We need to
find him.

1638
01:18:52,770 --> 01:18:54,939
Hey, hey, one of you better get Ivan on the line
now.

1639
01:18:55,064 --> 01:18:56,375
"On... on the line"?

1640
01:18:56,399 --> 01:18:58,001
- "On the line"?
- What the fuck is funny?

1641
01:18:58,025 --> 01:19:00,445
- Who the fuck are these guys?
- What the fuck is funny, man?

1642
01:19:00,570 --> 01:19:03,298
I'm telling you to call Ivan. What's wrong
with that? Don't complicate your life.

1643
01:19:03,322 --> 01:19:05,426
Man, I'm gonna come back there and just gonna
fucking...

1644
01:19:05,450 --> 01:19:07,261
I'll complicate your fucking life,
you motherfucker.

1645
01:19:07,285 --> 01:19:09,537
- Why?
- That's not a good idea. That is not a good idea.

1646
01:19:09,662 --> 01:19:10,872
Get the fuck out of here.

1647
01:19:10,997 --> 01:19:12,474
- Tom.
- What's up, man?

1648
01:19:12,498 --> 01:19:14,625
Tough guy. What do you plan
to do with that?

1649
01:19:14,750 --> 01:19:16,627
Break your legs
if you don't get the fuck out.

1650
01:19:16,752 --> 01:19:18,981
I told
you it's a fucking bad idea.

1651
01:19:19,005 --> 01:19:21,340
- Tom.
- So pick up your phone and call him now.

1652
01:19:21,466 --> 01:19:23,026
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
- Tom.

1653
01:19:23,050 --> 01:19:26,012
Fuck off.
Fucking smash everything.

1654
01:19:29,098 --> 01:19:30,868
- What the fuck?
- Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck...

1655
01:19:30,892 --> 01:19:33,060
Tell him to
fucking stop! What the fuck?

1656
01:19:33,186 --> 01:19:35,313
- Oh, no.
- Fucking call Ivan now!

1657
01:19:35,438 --> 01:19:37,040
- What the fuck, man?
- Okay, okay.

1658
01:19:37,064 --> 01:19:38,483
- Jesus, fuck!
- That's crazy.

1659
01:19:38,608 --> 01:19:40,443
- Oh, fuck.
- I am so fucked.

1660
01:19:40,568 --> 01:19:42,528
Put it on speaker.

1661
01:19:42,653 --> 01:19:44,614
I am so fucked.

1662
01:19:44,739 --> 01:19:45,966
Please leave your message...

1663
01:19:45,990 --> 01:19:47,676
- Where's your phone?
- Hold on, man.

1664
01:19:47,700 --> 01:19:49,140
Just don't break anything,
all right?

1665
01:19:49,243 --> 01:19:50,596
- Call him.
- What the fuck?

1666
01:19:50,620 --> 01:19:52,580
- Put it on speaker.
- There you go. There you go.

1667
01:19:52,622 --> 01:19:53,682
Just don't break anything, man.

1668
01:19:53,706 --> 01:19:55,726
He's not gonna answer the
phone. He's not gonna answer.

1669
01:19:55,750 --> 01:19:57,561
- I know. I know it.
- Please leave your message...

1670
01:19:57,585 --> 01:19:59,271
He's not gonna fucking answer.

1671
01:19:59,295 --> 01:20:00,171
Where's his other friend?

1672
01:20:00,296 --> 01:20:01,422
Is he with Aleks?

1673
01:20:01,547 --> 01:20:03,609
Aleks is working right now.
He can't be with Aleks.

1674
01:20:03,633 --> 01:20:05,676
- Where is he working?
- Tatiana's.

1675
01:20:05,801 --> 01:20:07,053
- Fuck.
- Let's go.

1676
01:20:07,178 --> 01:20:09,388
No. Oh, no.

1677
01:20:09,514 --> 01:20:11,390
What the hell?

1678
01:20:13,434 --> 01:20:16,145
- Jesus fucking Christ.
- Where are you going?

1679
01:20:16,270 --> 01:20:18,356
- To the car.
- It's five-minute walk.

1680
01:20:18,481 --> 01:20:20,959
- No, no, no. I'm not walking down there.
- Let's drive up there.

1681
01:20:20,983 --> 01:20:23,253
- It's fucking freezing.
- No, I'm not gonna look for other parking.

1682
01:20:23,277 --> 01:20:24,917
- Come on, let's go.
- Why don't we drive?

1683
01:20:24,987 --> 01:20:26,155
It's right here. Walk.

1684
01:20:26,280 --> 01:20:27,782
Chop-chop. Move.

1685
01:20:27,907 --> 01:20:29,827
It's fucking cold,
man. Look at me.

1686
01:20:29,951 --> 01:20:31,911
Are you doing this on purpose?
What the fuck, bro.

1687
01:20:40,836 --> 01:20:42,439
That took
way fucking longer

1688
01:20:42,463 --> 01:20:43,463
than five minutes.

1689
01:20:43,548 --> 01:20:45,383
Hey.

1690
01:20:45,508 --> 01:20:47,051
Table for four?

1691
01:20:47,385 --> 01:20:49,512
Is Aleks here?
Aleks?

1692
01:20:49,637 --> 01:20:51,264
Aleks?

1693
01:20:51,389 --> 01:20:52,429
He should be working here.

1694
01:20:52,515 --> 01:20:53,849
- The assistant cook?
- Yes.

1695
01:20:53,975 --> 01:20:55,935
- Let's go.
- No, wait. Hold on.

1696
01:20:56,060 --> 01:20:58,247
- You guys cannot go in there.
- No, you're good. You're good.

1697
01:20:58,271 --> 01:21:00,231
They know
what they're doing, relax.

1698
01:21:01,566 --> 01:21:03,442
- Oh, my God, Aleks.
- Ani!

1699
01:21:03,568 --> 01:21:05,528
- Have you seen Vanya?
- No. What's going on?

1700
01:21:05,653 --> 01:21:07,673
We're looking for Vanya.
It's a family emergency.

1701
01:21:07,697 --> 01:21:09,937
- Have you seen Ivan?
- What the fuck is going on?

1702
01:21:10,032 --> 01:21:11,576
- Have you seen Ivan?
- No.

1703
01:21:11,701 --> 01:21:14,346
- You're good. No, you're good.
- I can get fired.

1704
01:21:14,370 --> 01:21:15,246
You're good. Don't worry.

1705
01:21:15,371 --> 01:21:17,224
- Don't worry about it.
- Can you call him, please?

1706
01:21:17,248 --> 01:21:19,518
- I haven't seen him. Call him? Really?
- Yes, just call him.

1707
01:21:19,542 --> 01:21:21,853
- Yes, please call him. Call him.
- Are you an actress?

1708
01:21:21,877 --> 01:21:23,838
I saw you somewhere? Uh?
- I'm not an actress, no.

1709
01:21:23,963 --> 01:21:25,899
No? You look good.
Where are you from?

1710
01:21:25,923 --> 01:21:27,901
Give me your phone
one second. One second.

1711
01:21:27,925 --> 01:21:30,237
We can't find Vanya anywhere.
Have you talked to him today?

1712
01:21:30,261 --> 01:21:32,823
- No, I haven't saw him. He's probably at home.
- No, he's not

1713
01:21:32,847 --> 01:21:34,967
at home, and Tom and Crystal
haven't seen him, either.

1714
01:21:35,016 --> 01:21:36,767
Can I have my phone back, please?
Thank you.

1715
01:21:36,892 --> 01:21:38,185
- I need Ivan's photo.
- Okay.

1716
01:21:38,311 --> 01:21:40,479
You got to have your husband's
photo on your phone.

1717
01:21:40,605 --> 01:21:43,441
- No, I am not giving you my phone.
- I need your phone for one second.

1718
01:21:43,566 --> 01:21:45,806
- I just need your phone...
- I... No, and you know what?

1719
01:21:45,860 --> 01:21:47,620
If you touch me again,
I will fucking scream.

1720
01:21:47,695 --> 01:21:49,423
- Shh, shh. Stop. Stop.
- Use Instagram.

1721
01:21:49,447 --> 01:21:50,948
I don't have
Instagram.

1722
01:21:51,073 --> 01:21:52,801
I'm an adult, man. What are you talking about?

1723
01:21:52,825 --> 01:21:54,660
You're going to cost me
my job here. Please.

1724
01:21:54,994 --> 01:21:56,329
I have it. Here.

1725
01:21:56,454 --> 01:21:57,830
- Guys.
- Oh, okay.

1726
01:21:57,955 --> 01:21:59,516
- Ani, what's-what's going on?
- We're looking for...

1727
01:21:59,540 --> 01:22:01,709
We're looking for Vanya.
We don't know where he is.

1728
01:22:01,834 --> 01:22:03,353
But it's like,
this nigga's fucking insane.

1729
01:22:03,377 --> 01:22:05,588
Okay, thank you. Where...

1730
01:22:06,672 --> 01:22:08,174
Where are you going?

1731
01:22:13,471 --> 01:22:14,951
You think that
he would be with Dasha?

1732
01:22:15,056 --> 01:22:17,642
Not unless
he's in Bahamas with her

1733
01:22:17,767 --> 01:22:19,560
and her new fuck boy.

1734
01:22:20,936 --> 01:22:23,481
Stop the music one second.
Stop the music.

1735
01:22:23,606 --> 01:22:27,193
Excuse me, I'm
terribly sorry.

1736
01:22:27,318 --> 01:22:29,445
But I need one minute
of your attention.

1737
01:22:29,779 --> 01:22:33,074
We are looking for
a missing child, a sick child.

1738
01:22:33,449 --> 01:22:35,409
I'm going to show you his photo.

1739
01:22:35,534 --> 01:22:38,120
Any information
would be greatly appreciated.

1740
01:22:38,245 --> 01:22:41,082
We're the ones fucking paying
and he wants attention?

1741
01:22:41,207 --> 01:22:44,585
My apologies,
but the kid is very sick.

1742
01:22:44,710 --> 01:22:47,463
Please let us know
if you've seen him.

1743
01:22:48,214 --> 01:22:49,715
You didn't see him?

1744
01:22:51,550 --> 01:22:53,886
- Give me a cigarette.
- Are you kidding me?

1745
01:22:54,011 --> 01:22:56,972
I'm freezing,
and this guy wants cigarettes.

1746
01:22:57,348 --> 01:22:58,974
Toros, seriously...

1747
01:23:05,523 --> 01:23:08,526
You'll get cold
if you don't cover your neck.

1748
01:23:11,195 --> 01:23:13,197
Why did you bring that?

1749
01:23:14,323 --> 01:23:16,867
Why the fuck
did you bring that?

1750
01:23:17,993 --> 01:23:20,371
Why? So you could
fucking gag me again?

1751
01:23:20,496 --> 01:23:22,081
Motherfucker.

1752
01:23:36,762 --> 01:23:39,473
Fuck it. Give me the scarf.

1753
01:24:04,999 --> 01:24:08,043
No! No! No!
Swear to God!

1754
01:24:08,169 --> 01:24:12,006
Hey! Hey! This is my car!
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

1755
01:24:12,131 --> 01:24:13,692
- No, no, no.
- Man, it's already attached.

1756
01:24:13,716 --> 01:24:15,694
- Please.
- It's already attached. I got to take it.

1757
01:24:15,718 --> 01:24:18,137
- I got to take it in.
- Don't take my car. Don't do that.

1758
01:24:18,262 --> 01:24:20,765
- This is my car.
- Hey, listen to me. Hey! It's your fault!

1759
01:24:20,890 --> 01:24:22,993
You were parked in the middle
of the fucking street, okay?

1760
01:24:23,017 --> 01:24:25,120
My friend, I was just parking!
There is no sign.

1761
01:24:25,144 --> 01:24:26,955
- I'll give you money. How much?
- Listen to me.

1762
01:24:26,979 --> 01:24:29,791
- 100, 200, 300? Tell me.
- Listen, down in the yard, you're gonna talk to

1763
01:24:29,815 --> 01:24:30,834
- people.
- Take the money.

1764
01:24:30,858 --> 01:24:32,377
- Okay? You're gonna talk...
- Take the money.

1765
01:24:32,401 --> 01:24:34,601
- Fuck you, then. Fuck you.
- What do you mean, fuck me?

1766
01:24:34,653 --> 01:24:36,631
- Fuck you.
- What the... I don't give a shit.

1767
01:24:36,655 --> 01:24:38,282
- Hey.
- Get the fuck out of my way.

1768
01:24:38,407 --> 01:24:39,527
You get out the fucking car!

1769
01:24:39,617 --> 01:24:41,457
You fucking asked for this.

1770
01:24:45,498 --> 01:24:47,750
I've been on the job
two fucking weeks, bro!

1771
01:24:47,875 --> 01:24:50,753
What the fuck are you...
Are you fucking kidding?

1772
01:24:50,878 --> 01:24:52,129
Fucking kidding me!

1773
01:24:52,254 --> 01:24:53,857
- Oh, my fucking God.
- Jesus Christ!

1774
01:24:53,881 --> 01:24:55,317
Are you fucking...

1775
01:24:55,341 --> 01:24:56,383
It's all because of you.

1776
01:24:56,509 --> 01:24:58,177
- It's all because of you.
- Fuck you!

1777
01:24:58,302 --> 01:25:00,054
- Get in the car!
- Come on! Come on!

1778
01:25:00,179 --> 01:25:02,240
You are so fucked. I have your license
plate.

1779
01:25:02,264 --> 01:25:03,974
If you get in that car,
you're all fucked.

1780
01:25:04,099 --> 01:25:05,452
No, no, no, no, no!

1781
01:25:05,476 --> 01:25:07,061
What the fuck are you doing?

1782
01:25:07,186 --> 01:25:08,646
- Fuck you, Russians!
- God.

1783
01:25:08,771 --> 01:25:10,606
Jesus Christ.
You are crazy.

1784
01:25:10,731 --> 01:25:13,067
You guys are
fucking crazy.

1785
01:25:13,192 --> 01:25:14,443
We're going to find this fucker

1786
01:25:14,568 --> 01:25:16,904
even if it takes
all fucking night.

1787
01:25:17,029 --> 01:25:19,824
I swear on my
mother's life...

1788
01:25:19,949 --> 01:25:22,660
What the fuck did you just do?

1789
01:25:24,662 --> 01:25:26,807
Come on,
give me something. Like, something.

1790
01:25:26,831 --> 01:25:27,957
Some... Where would you...

1791
01:25:28,082 --> 01:25:30,185
- I don't know.
- I don't know. - TOROS: Think. Think. Where?

1792
01:25:30,209 --> 01:25:31,769
He... Gaming.
He likes video games.

1793
01:25:31,794 --> 01:25:34,380
Maybe he'll be at an arcade
or something. I don't know.

1794
01:25:36,632 --> 01:25:39,969
Hurry up.
Stay awake, man.

1795
01:25:40,594 --> 01:25:43,556
Guys,
anybody see this guy today?

1796
01:25:44,431 --> 01:25:46,642
Have you seen Vanya Zakharov?

1797
01:25:48,060 --> 01:25:50,604
Guys, see this kid today?

1798
01:25:51,856 --> 01:25:53,291
Oh! Billiard hall.

1799
01:25:53,315 --> 01:25:54,608
There-there is
the billiard hall.

1800
01:25:54,733 --> 01:25:56,360
Remember five years ago we...

1801
01:25:56,485 --> 01:25:58,404
you-you were teaching him
how to play billiard?

1802
01:25:58,529 --> 01:26:00,289
We played here,
right here around the corner.

1803
01:26:00,406 --> 01:26:02,449
- You remember?
- Five years ago?

1804
01:26:02,575 --> 01:26:03,868
I remember.

1805
01:26:07,079 --> 01:26:08,581
Come, come.
One second, my friend.

1806
01:26:08,706 --> 01:26:10,291
Look at this picture.
Have you seen

1807
01:26:10,416 --> 01:26:11,542
- this guy?
- Ivan, Ivan.

1808
01:26:11,667 --> 01:26:12,835
- Is that Vanya?
- Yeah.

1809
01:26:12,960 --> 01:26:14,086
Have you seen him today?

1810
01:26:14,211 --> 01:26:15,546
- No, not today.
- No.

1811
01:26:15,671 --> 01:26:17,357
He does the greatest
parties, though.

1812
01:26:17,381 --> 01:26:18,465
Yeah, he's really cool.

1813
01:26:18,591 --> 01:26:21,093
I hate this bitch so much,

1814
01:26:21,218 --> 01:26:23,470
I want to vomit
when I see her face.

1815
01:26:23,596 --> 01:26:26,056
Please leave your message...

1816
01:26:26,181 --> 01:26:28,142
Guys, have you seen this guy?

1817
01:26:28,267 --> 01:26:30,311
He's-he's been missing.

1818
01:26:31,437 --> 01:26:32,646
You sure?

1819
01:26:33,564 --> 01:26:34,857
Let me ask them.

1820
01:26:34,982 --> 01:26:37,401
- Wait, stop.
- Give me a second.

1821
01:26:37,526 --> 01:26:40,112
Guys, have
you seen this... this guy today?

1822
01:26:40,237 --> 01:26:41,697
No.

1823
01:26:43,198 --> 01:26:46,201
He's probably not
lost, perhaps he is kidnapped.

1824
01:26:46,327 --> 01:26:49,455
Yeah sure, kidnapped...
Of course.

1825
01:26:51,790 --> 01:26:54,293
Think, think,
think, think.

1826
01:26:54,418 --> 01:26:56,170
And can you keep
calling him, please?

1827
01:27:00,549 --> 01:27:01,651
What the fuck?

1828
01:27:01,675 --> 01:27:03,761
- Oh, my God.
- Oh, you got to be

1829
01:27:03,886 --> 01:27:05,646
- fucking kidding me!
- Jesus fucking Christ.

1830
01:27:06,722 --> 01:27:08,642
You understand that my wife

1831
01:27:08,766 --> 01:27:10,809
has to drive this car tomorrow?

1832
01:27:10,935 --> 01:27:12,394
Do you?

1833
01:27:12,519 --> 01:27:15,356
How am I gonna get rid
of this smell? Huh?

1834
01:27:15,689 --> 01:27:18,859
It's better
you go back to Yerevan.

1835
01:27:18,984 --> 01:27:21,862
Fucking get rid of you.

1836
01:27:21,987 --> 01:27:23,489
Do you want to blow us up?

1837
01:27:23,614 --> 01:27:25,574
- I'm careful.
- Fuck off!

1838
01:27:25,699 --> 01:27:26,951
Get the fuck out of here!

1839
01:27:29,745 --> 01:27:31,455
You care about
Ivan more than me.

1840
01:27:31,580 --> 01:27:33,415
Start cleaning!

1841
01:27:33,540 --> 01:27:37,294
Who's more important?
Ivan or your dying brother?

1842
01:27:37,419 --> 01:27:39,379
Yeah, I'm not
getting back in there.

1843
01:27:39,546 --> 01:27:41,924
- Fuck Ivan. Fuck that little bitch.
- Mm-mm.

1844
01:27:42,049 --> 01:27:44,718
It still fucking
stinks in here.

1845
01:27:44,843 --> 01:27:47,388
Fuck, I know. Shit!

1846
01:27:49,556 --> 01:27:51,725
Which clubs did you go
with him?

1847
01:27:51,850 --> 01:27:53,250
- I don't know. We went to...
- Huh?

1848
01:27:53,310 --> 01:27:55,437
I don't know.
We went to a lot of 'em.

1849
01:27:55,562 --> 01:27:57,147
Take me to every single one.

1850
01:27:59,233 --> 01:28:01,610
Hey, have you seen
this guy today?

1851
01:28:01,735 --> 01:28:04,446
Yeah, we cut him off.
He was wasted.

1852
01:28:04,571 --> 01:28:05,698
When?

1853
01:28:05,823 --> 01:28:07,783
Like 20 minutes ago.

1854
01:28:07,908 --> 01:28:09,076
He just left.

1855
01:28:09,201 --> 01:28:11,662
Have you guys seen
this guy today?

1856
01:28:12,913 --> 01:28:13,956
No?

1857
01:28:14,081 --> 01:28:16,291
Did you ask about
Ivan Zakharov?

1858
01:28:16,917 --> 01:28:19,878
- He left me an $800 bill.
- Where is he now?

1859
01:28:20,004 --> 01:28:22,381
How should I know?
But somebody has to pay me.

1860
01:28:22,506 --> 01:28:25,050
- Okay, bye.
- No, wait. But you know him.

1861
01:28:25,175 --> 01:28:26,552
I told him my apologies.

1862
01:28:26,677 --> 01:28:28,137
You can tell him one more time.

1863
01:28:28,262 --> 01:28:30,055
I'm gonna definitely
make them up to you.

1864
01:28:30,180 --> 01:28:31,849
Or up to them, or up to you.

1865
01:28:33,517 --> 01:28:35,436
Wh-What can I do?

1866
01:28:35,561 --> 01:28:37,312
Wh-What do you want me to do?

1867
01:28:37,438 --> 01:28:39,398
He's fine.

1868
01:28:39,732 --> 01:28:42,067
Tell his mom
that everything is fine,

1869
01:28:42,192 --> 01:28:43,360
he's sitting next to me.

1870
01:28:43,485 --> 01:28:45,213
Is it a real mink?

1871
01:28:45,237 --> 01:28:48,115
I'm telling you...
I can't talk anymore. I have to go.

1872
01:28:48,240 --> 01:28:49,616
No.

1873
01:28:49,742 --> 01:28:51,386
Please, I'm begging you.
Please stop.

1874
01:28:51,410 --> 01:28:53,537
Oh.
It looks like real mink.

1875
01:28:53,662 --> 01:28:56,307
Of course I do. Why you...
I am ashamed as well.

1876
01:28:56,331 --> 01:28:58,518
Yeah, it's fucking
real, but it's not mink.

1877
01:28:58,542 --> 01:29:01,646
- I'm the godfather of that child.
- It's fucking Russian sable, okay?

1878
01:29:01,670 --> 01:29:03,338
Which is worth
a lot more than mink.

1879
01:29:03,464 --> 01:29:04,882
Of course I'm
ashamed.

1880
01:29:05,007 --> 01:29:06,359
No,
don't-don't ta...

1881
01:29:06,383 --> 01:29:07,402
don't talk
about that baby.

1882
01:29:07,426 --> 01:29:09,470
Guys, have you seen
this guy today?

1883
01:29:12,306 --> 01:29:14,767
- End of the line.
- I just have a question.

1884
01:29:14,892 --> 01:29:16,727
Have you seen this kid?

1885
01:29:17,061 --> 01:29:18,937
Yeah,
he was here 30 minutes ago.

1886
01:29:19,063 --> 01:29:20,606
He was too drunk to enter.

1887
01:29:20,731 --> 01:29:22,691
- Do you know where he went?
- Who the fuck knows.

1888
01:29:23,108 --> 01:29:24,388
Your I.D., please.

1889
01:29:24,610 --> 01:29:26,528
What a shitty godfather you are.

1890
01:29:26,653 --> 01:29:29,198
Instead of protecting the child,
you just left him.

1891
01:29:29,323 --> 01:29:31,158
Are you fucking with me?

1892
01:29:31,283 --> 01:29:33,494
Maybe he's on a bender.

1893
01:29:34,912 --> 01:29:36,497
If you're so competent,

1894
01:29:36,622 --> 01:29:37,706
why did you let him leave?

1895
01:29:37,831 --> 01:29:39,541
How do you say bender?

1896
01:29:39,666 --> 01:29:41,335
Uh, "bender."

1897
01:29:41,460 --> 01:29:44,046
It-it's a bender. Yeah.

1898
01:29:44,713 --> 01:29:47,150
Tor, what does
that have to do with competence?

1899
01:29:47,174 --> 01:29:49,635
Fuck this shit.
I didn't sign up for this.

1900
01:29:50,552 --> 01:29:54,098
I just want to go home
to Armenia. This sucks.

So fucked!

1908
01:30:33,220 --> 01:30:36,098
You know, he fucked me
much harder than he fucked you.

1909
01:30:36,223 --> 01:30:38,350

- Hundred percent.

1910

Trust me.

1911
01:30:41,186 --> 01:30:44,857
If we haven't found him by now,
we are not finding him.

1912
01:30:44,982 --> 01:30:47,985
Did I ask you? Did I ask you?

1913
01:30:48,110 --> 01:30:49,820
I'm just saying, man.

1914
01:30:49,945 --> 01:30:51,506
Keep your opinion
to yourself.

1915
01:30:51,530 --> 01:30:54,324
I'm not going to
talk at all from now on.

1916
01:31:01,874 --> 01:31:04,084
Ani's fucking
billionaire husband

1917
01:31:04,209 --> 01:31:06,211
just strolled in,
and he's looking for action.

1918
01:31:06,336 --> 01:31:08,380
And I'm gonna give him some.

1919
01:31:08,505 --> 01:31:10,382
Vanya?

1920
01:31:10,507 --> 01:31:12,009
Vanya.

1921
01:31:12,134 --> 01:31:13,677
You know, it's so sad.

1922
01:31:13,802 --> 01:31:16,346
That marriage must really be
in the toilet already.

1923
01:31:16,471 --> 01:31:17,514
Vanya's here?

1924
01:31:19,433 --> 01:31:21,101
'Scuse!

1925
01:31:22,603 --> 01:31:25,063
- Have you seen this guy today?
- No.

1926
01:31:25,189 --> 01:31:26,773
How about you, sir?

1927
01:31:26,899 --> 01:31:29,401
Igor, thank you
for the pills.

1928
01:31:33,363 --> 01:31:35,699
I want what he
had. I want one of those.

1929
01:31:44,875 --> 01:31:47,878
Did you fucking hear me?
I said, "I want one of those."

1930
01:31:50,130 --> 01:31:51,173
No.

1931
01:31:52,257 --> 01:31:53,258
No?

1932
01:31:53,383 --> 01:31:55,219
What the fuck? Why?

1933
01:31:55,344 --> 01:31:57,387
'Cause I don't deal drugs.

1934
01:31:57,512 --> 01:31:59,640
A fucking gopnik who can afford
to live in Brightwater

1935
01:31:59,765 --> 01:32:01,141
and doesn't deal drugs?

1936
01:32:01,266 --> 01:32:02,684
Yeah, right.

1937
01:32:02,809 --> 01:32:06,563
It's my grandmother's apartment
and her drugs.

1938
01:32:20,786 --> 01:32:24,039
I don't have any more,
and I'm not gopnik.

1939
01:32:25,123 --> 01:32:26,250
Yeah, you're right.

1940
01:32:26,375 --> 01:32:28,627
You're a faggot-ass bitch,
is what you are.

1941
01:32:29,086 --> 01:32:31,338
Hey, guys, have you seen
this guy today?

1942
01:32:31,463 --> 01:32:32,756
No.

1943
01:32:32,881 --> 01:32:35,592
What does
faggot-ass bitch mean?

1944
01:32:36,593 --> 01:32:38,637
Fucking faggot.

1945
01:32:38,762 --> 01:32:40,681
Yep, what he said.

1946
01:32:43,433 --> 01:32:45,286
- Go away!
- Why are you being rude?

1947
01:32:45,310 --> 01:32:48,021
I'm just asking a question.
I don't give a shit.

1948
01:32:49,898 --> 01:32:52,651
And why am I
faggot-ass bitch?

1949
01:32:54,444 --> 01:32:55,821
I don't know.

1950
01:32:55,946 --> 01:32:58,115
They say you're
just born that way.

1951
01:33:02,494 --> 01:33:04,871
You know what, I'm so
sick of your generation, man.

1952
01:33:04,997 --> 01:33:06,331
I mean, look at you.

1953
01:33:06,456 --> 01:33:08,166
No respect for elder,

1954
01:33:08,292 --> 01:33:10,961
no respect for authority,
no goals.

1955
01:33:11,086 --> 01:33:13,463
I mean, the only goal you have
just to buy

1956
01:33:13,588 --> 01:33:15,132
pair of cool sneakers.
That's all.

1957
01:33:15,257 --> 01:33:16,550
I mean, honestly. Come on.

1958
01:33:16,675 --> 01:33:18,135
What the fuck
is wrong with you? Huh?

1959
01:33:19,678 --> 01:33:23,515
Why don't you just
hear me out?

1960
01:33:23,849 --> 01:33:26,393
No work ethics.

1961
01:33:26,518 --> 01:33:28,020
Lazy, stupid.

1962
01:33:28,145 --> 01:33:29,438
I don't understand.

1963
01:33:29,563 --> 01:33:32,274
I've been working
since I'm 16 years old.

1964
01:33:32,399 --> 01:33:34,693
What is wrong with you?

1965
01:33:34,818 --> 01:33:37,446
All you do is TikTok,
Instagram, TikTok, Instagram.

1966
01:33:37,571 --> 01:33:38,571
That's it.

1967
01:33:38,613 --> 01:33:39,698
He's at HQ!

1968
01:33:39,823 --> 01:33:40,907
What?

1969
01:33:41,033 --> 01:33:42,701
Fucking Headquarters!

1970
01:33:45,078 --> 01:33:47,706
Hey. Hello.

1971
01:33:47,831 --> 01:33:49,809
- What's the address?
- West 38th Street.

1972
01:33:49,833 --> 01:33:51,352
Whoo!
I fucking love that place.

1973
01:33:51,376 --> 01:33:52,696
You mean fucking Manhattan?

1974
01:33:52,794 --> 01:33:54,234
Yeah, it's in
fucking Manhattan.

1975
01:33:54,296 --> 01:33:55,648
Oh, my fucking God.

1976
01:33:55,672 --> 01:33:57,108
- Hurry up!
- Oh, I need cash.

1977
01:33:57,132 --> 01:33:58,132
Toros!

1978
01:33:58,175 --> 01:33:59,551
That's 45 minutes away.
Hurry up.

1979
01:34:00,177 --> 01:34:02,220
Beautiful.

1980
01:34:02,346 --> 01:34:04,389
You're Vanya, right?

1981
01:34:04,514 --> 01:34:05,640
Yeah, that's me.

1983
01:34:08,769 --> 01:34:11,229
It's not Anora. It's Ani.

there at any cost.

physically hold him.

his rocks off.

2032

- We were looking for you

2033
01:36:03,842 --> 01:36:06,571
all night, you fuck! Vanya, we've been
fucking looking for you. All night!

2034
01:36:06,595 --> 01:36:08,656
I've been texting. I've been fucking
calling you.

2035
01:36:08,680 --> 01:36:10,891
Why haven't you answered any of my
fucking calls?

2036
01:36:11,016 --> 01:36:13,494
- You little son of a bitch.
- Why'd you fucking leave me, Vanya?

2037
01:36:13,518 --> 01:36:16,998
I tried to run after you. These guys, they fucking
tied my wrists up. They took my ring.

2038
01:36:17,063 --> 01:36:18,958
- For what, bro?
- They fucking assaulted me, Vanya.

2039
01:36:18,982 --> 01:36:21,193
Okay, get up. Let's go.
You can talk in the car.

2040
01:36:21,651 --> 01:36:23,045
- Get up.
- No, I fucking found

2041
01:36:23,069 --> 01:36:24,946
him, so I get to fucking
talk to him.

2042
01:36:25,071 --> 01:36:27,008
- Okay? That was the deal.
- Vanya, our hour's not over.

2043
01:36:27,032 --> 01:36:28,533
Oh, get her the fuck
out of here!

2044
01:36:28,658 --> 01:36:30,702
Oh, get the fuck out
of my private, bitch!

2045
01:36:30,827 --> 01:36:32,871
- Vanya, look at me.
- I am looking at you.

2046
01:36:32,996 --> 01:36:34,247
I'm coming back, bitch.

2047
01:36:34,372 --> 01:36:35,624
Fuck you, Diamond.

2048
01:36:35,749 --> 01:36:37,375
This is very important.

2049
01:36:37,501 --> 01:36:38,543
Vanya, look at me.

2050
01:36:38,668 --> 01:36:39,961
Just listen to me, baby, listen.

2051
01:36:40,086 --> 01:36:42,130
These guys, they want us
to get a divorce, okay?

2052
01:36:42,255 --> 01:36:43,507
It's not divorce.

2053
01:36:43,632 --> 01:36:45,884
- I told you hundred times.
- Back off. Let me...

2054
01:36:46,009 --> 01:36:47,260
It's annulment. Annulment.

2055
01:36:47,385 --> 01:36:48,696
- Ah.
- Vanya, tell them

2056
01:36:48,720 --> 01:36:50,347
that we're not gonna
get a divorce, okay?

2057
01:36:50,472 --> 01:36:53,159
- Tell them that this is a mistake.
- Are my parents here yet?

2058
01:36:53,183 --> 01:36:55,536
- Baby, this is very important.
- Listen to me here.

2059
01:36:55,560 --> 01:36:57,788
No, no, no. We... TOROS: Your parents
are coming at 12:00.

2060
01:36:57,812 --> 01:37:00,315
I helped you find him,
so let me fucking talk to him.

2061
01:37:00,440 --> 01:37:02,418
We still need
to go to the courthouse!

2062
01:37:02,442 --> 01:37:05,338
Vanya, just look at me, okay?
Fucking ignore them. It doesn't fucking matter

2063
01:37:05,362 --> 01:37:08,382
about her. It doesn't matter about anything, okay?
Just... I need you to tell them...

2064
01:37:08,406 --> 01:37:09,991
Vanya, this is not funny.

2065
01:37:10,116 --> 01:37:11,618
I know. It's not.

2066
01:37:11,743 --> 01:37:14,287
Vanya, look at me, baby.
- Let's stay married, okay?

2067
01:37:14,412 --> 01:37:16,873
Yeah. You know these guys?
Yeah, I love them. I love them.

2068
01:37:16,998 --> 01:37:18,198
Jesus, Vanya.

2069
01:37:19,501 --> 01:37:20,835
We have to talk
about this, okay?

2070
01:37:20,961 --> 01:37:22,396
This is very,
very important, all right?

2071
01:37:22,420 --> 01:37:24,422
I don't want to talk
about it right now.

2072
01:37:24,548 --> 01:37:26,275
Okay, but just-just... Look what he...

2073
01:37:26,299 --> 01:37:28,301
No, no, no, Vanya,
we can't drink right now.

2074
01:37:28,426 --> 01:37:30,196
You need to tell them...
Guys, he's fucking drunk.

2075
01:37:30,220 --> 01:37:31,763
We can't talk right... No.

2076
01:37:31,888 --> 01:37:33,128
We're not fucking done talking.

2077
01:37:33,181 --> 01:37:34,933
- I wanted to talk to him.
- Come on.

2078
01:37:35,058 --> 01:37:36,560
Here we go!

2079
01:37:36,685 --> 01:37:38,895
Vanya. Vanya.

2080
01:37:41,106 --> 01:37:43,441
Vanya, Vanya, we have to keep
talking about this.

2081
01:37:44,985 --> 01:37:45,986
Vanya!

2082
01:37:46,111 --> 01:37:48,780
Do not fucking touch me! Jesus.

2083
01:37:48,905 --> 01:37:51,116
Vanya, we're not...
we have to keep talking.

2084
01:37:51,241 --> 01:37:53,441
They're trying to bring us
to get a divorce. We can't...

2085
01:37:53,535 --> 01:37:54,744
Do not fucking...

2086
01:37:54,869 --> 01:37:56,454
Get the fuck out
of my fucking face.

2087
01:37:56,580 --> 01:37:59,583
Jimmy, Ani's here with
three guys causing a scene.

2088
01:37:59,708 --> 01:38:00,875

01:38:14,306 --> 01:38:16,850
Wrong one, bitch.

2097
01:38:18,977 --> 01:38:20,937
Guys, there's a fucking fight!

2098
01:38:21,062 --> 01:38:22,772

01:38:22,897 --> 01:38:25,066

01:38:42,375 --> 01:38:44,711
Take it outside.
Take that shit outside.

2106
01:38:44,836 --> 01:38:47,172
There's no fighting at HQ.

2107
01:38:47,297 --> 01:38:48,733
Okay, calm down.

2108
01:38:48,757 --> 01:38:50,717
- Whoa.
- Man, get the fuck out of here! No.

2109
01:38:50,759 --> 01:38:52,759
- Get the fuck out of here.
- Get in.

2110
01:38:52,802 --> 01:38:54,971
Get back.
Get the fuck out of here.

2111
01:38:55,096 --> 01:38:57,349
- You told me Ani's one of our girls.
- Go. Go.

2112
01:38:58,683 --> 01:39:00,852
Fucking found you! We found you!

2113
01:39:01,978 --> 01:39:05,148
I can't believe you went
running like a fucking baby.

2114
01:39:05,273 --> 01:39:07,067
But it's okay.
Your parents are coming.

2115
01:39:07,192 --> 01:39:08,943
You're gone.
You're gone, finally.

2116
01:39:09,069 --> 01:39:11,237
- Fucking gone.
- Vanya. Vanya.

2117
01:39:11,363 --> 01:39:12,947
Do you know
what's happening right now?

2118
01:39:13,073 --> 01:39:15,575
Do you fucking know what's
going on right now, Vanya?

2119
01:39:15,700 --> 01:39:17,535
- Mm-hmm.
- Get off me, man.

2120
01:39:17,661 --> 01:39:18,846
He's fucking wasted. He-he...

2121
01:39:18,870 --> 01:39:20,747
I need to talk to him
when he's fucking sober.

2122
01:39:20,872 --> 01:39:23,100
- I can't talk to him like this.
- Talking is done.

2123
01:39:23,124 --> 01:39:24,376
Talking is not done.

2124
01:39:24,501 --> 01:39:26,062
Of course he's gonna do
anything you say.

2125
01:39:26,086 --> 01:39:27,563
- He's fucking plastered.
- Talking is done.

2126
01:39:27,587 --> 01:39:29,589
Now we're gonna get
this thing done in three hours.

2127
01:39:29,714 --> 01:39:31,776
- No, this wasn't the fucking deal.
- Yes, it was.

2128
01:39:31,800 --> 01:39:33,468
Oh, slow down.
I'm gonna get sick.

2129
01:39:33,593 --> 01:39:35,112
We're gonna get
this thing done.

2130
01:39:35,136 --> 01:39:36,530
You're gonna get
your fucking money,

2131
01:39:36,554 --> 01:39:38,473
and you're gonna walk away...
that's it.

2132
01:39:38,598 --> 01:39:39,891
That was the deal.

2133
01:39:42,102 --> 01:39:43,353
Fuck.

2134
01:39:43,478 --> 01:39:44,896
What? You know, you must...

2135
01:39:45,021 --> 01:39:46,582
You must really hate me, man.

2136
01:39:46,606 --> 01:39:48,274
I mean, seriously.

2137
01:39:48,400 --> 01:39:51,111
And after all
I've done for you.

2138
01:39:51,236 --> 01:39:52,570
You know, everything.

2139
01:39:52,696 --> 01:39:54,698
I mean, I bailed you out
how many times?

2140
01:39:54,823 --> 01:39:56,908
Huh? How many times?

2141
01:39:57,033 --> 01:39:59,577
And you do this to me?

2142
01:39:59,703 --> 01:40:01,579
You know, it-it makes me upset.

2143
01:40:01,705 --> 01:40:03,039
You know, it's...
You know how...

2144
01:40:03,164 --> 01:40:05,375
how embarrassing
that is for me?

2145
01:40:07,043 --> 01:40:08,545
Huh?

2146
01:40:08,670 --> 01:40:11,589
Are you even listening
to what I'm saying?

2147
01:40:11,715 --> 01:40:14,217
He's passed out, abed.

2148
01:40:18,012 --> 01:40:19,514
Now we wait.

2149
01:40:34,946 --> 01:40:36,239
Okay. He's here. Hey.

2150
01:40:36,364 --> 01:40:38,074
Wake up. Wake up.

2151
01:40:38,199 --> 01:40:39,325
He's here. Let's go.

2152
01:40:40,952 --> 01:40:44,706
- Vanya.
- Wake up, brother, come out, please.

2153
01:40:44,831 --> 01:40:47,935
- I want to stay in the car.
- Vanya, Vanya, look at me.

2154
01:40:47,959 --> 01:40:50,962
Do not get a
ticket and do not get towed.

2155
01:40:51,087 --> 01:40:53,757
We need to talk
before you go in there, okay?

2156
01:40:53,882 --> 01:40:55,443
- Vanya?
- Keep your phone on.

2157
01:40:55,467 --> 01:40:57,027
Vanya, Vanya,
don't say anything

2158
01:40:57,051 --> 01:40:59,262
when you go in there, okay?
Vanya.

2159
01:40:59,387 --> 01:41:00,930
Vanya, I'm gonna
handle this, okay.

2160
01:41:01,055 --> 01:41:02,640
- I got it.
- Handle what?

2161
01:41:02,766 --> 01:41:04,976
- Don't talk to him.
- None of your fucking business.

2162
01:41:05,101 --> 01:41:06,454
- Let's go.
- Hello, everyone.

2163
01:41:06,478 --> 01:41:08,354
- How are you, sir?
- Toros.

2164
01:41:08,480 --> 01:41:11,191
- Stop it, stop it, stop it.
- Whoa, whoa. Is he all right there?

2165
01:41:11,316 --> 01:41:13,318
Does he fucking look
all right to you?

2166
01:41:13,443 --> 01:41:15,695
- He is okay.
- He is not fucking all right.

2167
01:41:15,820 --> 01:41:17,697
- He can barely stand.
- How are you?

2168
01:41:17,822 --> 01:41:19,662
Fine, thanks. Uh, the judge
is being very kind,

2169
01:41:19,741 --> 01:41:20,992
and he bumped us up.

2170
01:41:21,117 --> 01:41:23,077
- Good.
- Hello, Ivan.

2171
01:41:25,121 --> 01:41:29,209
Ivan, it's Michael
Sharnov, your father's attorney.

2172
01:41:29,334 --> 01:41:31,377
Remember me?
You don't remember Uncle Michael?

2173
01:41:32,420 --> 01:41:34,380
He's a little bit
tired.

2174
01:41:34,506 --> 01:41:35,506
- It's okay.
- I see.

2175
01:41:35,590 --> 01:41:36,800
Tired?

2176
01:41:36,925 --> 01:41:39,052
And this is the...

2177
01:41:40,220 --> 01:41:41,930
The lucky lady.

2178
01:41:43,014 --> 01:41:45,725
- Okay. And who is this?
- Him we're gonna need.

2179
01:41:45,850 --> 01:41:47,227
Just holding.

2180
01:41:47,727 --> 01:41:49,647
Okay, I don't know
what that means,

2181
01:41:49,771 --> 01:41:50,855
and I don't want to know.

2182
01:41:50,980 --> 01:41:55,652
Let's go. Get your I.D.'s ready.
I talked to him

2183
01:41:56,069 --> 01:42:01,282
and it's clear he wants this done.
But does he know that his son is intoxicated?

2184
01:42:01,407 --> 01:42:03,827
He's not intoxicated,
he just woke up.

2185
01:42:03,952 --> 01:42:05,592
Toros, please.
Come on, man.

2186
01:42:05,620 --> 01:42:07,580
I'm not gonna risk my license
because you can't...

2187
01:42:07,705 --> 01:42:09,833
You want to keep working
for Zakharov family or not?

2188
01:42:13,002 --> 01:42:14,796
Oh.

2189
01:42:15,880 --> 01:42:19,342
Mr. Sharnov.
Consider yourself very fortunate.

2190
01:42:19,467 --> 01:42:20,468
Your Honor.

2191
01:42:20,593 --> 01:42:24,514
We have a light calendar today, so, um,
what's your urgent matter?

2192
01:42:25,557 --> 01:42:30,186
Your Honor, we are here to file a complaint and
request for an immediate annulment of a union

2193
01:42:30,311 --> 01:42:33,356
that took place
under duress.

2194
01:42:33,481 --> 01:42:36,359
- Ivan Zakharov and Anora Mikheeva married...
- Duress, my fucking ass.

2195
01:42:36,484 --> 01:42:37,610
- Okay.
- Whoa!

2196
01:42:38,653 --> 01:42:41,298
I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Your Honor, but this
is bullshit. It's bullshit.

2197
01:42:41,322 --> 01:42:43,133
- Your Honor, I...
- These men are trying to...

2198
01:42:43,157 --> 01:42:45,302
You got to stop. You can't... you can't talk
this way.

2199
01:42:45,326 --> 01:42:47,346
Okay. I'm sorry. They're trying... Do not
fucking touch me.

2200
01:42:47,370 --> 01:42:50,391
- Who's this man in the camel coat?
- Security, please get this man away from me.

2201
01:42:50,415 --> 01:42:52,625
Who are you, sir?
Mr. Sharnov, is he with you?

2202
01:42:52,750 --> 01:42:53,936
Get... Get him away from me.

2203
01:42:53,960 --> 01:42:56,063
- Come on, come on. Come on.
- Officer, take him...

2204
01:42:56,087 --> 01:42:58,399
- Your Honor, I apologize.
- Thank you, Officer. I appreciate it.

2205
01:42:58,423 --> 01:43:00,192
- Okay, have a seat. Have a seat.
- I'm sorry.

2206
01:43:00,216 --> 01:43:02,152
And thank you, Your Honor. I really
appreciate it.

2207
01:43:02,176 --> 01:43:03,946
- You're welcome. You're welcome. Keep that tone.
- Okay.

2208
01:43:03,970 --> 01:43:05,865
- You're welcome.
- Your Honor, clearly, my husband is intoxicated

2209
01:43:05,889 --> 01:43:08,892
right now. He is in no place
to be making any decisions.

2210
01:43:09,017 --> 01:43:11,036
Uh, Your Honor, objection.
She shouldn't be talking.

2211
01:43:11,060 --> 01:43:12,621
Don't listen to her, please.

2212
01:43:12,645 --> 01:43:14,290
- Camel coat, sit down. Down.
- My stomach.

2213
01:43:14,314 --> 01:43:16,667
- He is clearly intoxicated, Your Honor.
- Why is she talking?

2214
01:43:16,691 --> 01:43:19,753
Your Honor, I apologize. Your Honor, what I have
been trying to explain to you,

2215
01:43:19,777 --> 01:43:21,338
- we got married legally.
- Objection, Your Honor.

2216
01:43:21,362 --> 01:43:23,257
They're not legally married, and she shouldn't
be talking.

2217
01:43:23,281 --> 01:43:24,884
- Sir. Sir.
- I shouldn't be talking?

2218
01:43:24,908 --> 01:43:26,701
- Camel man, sit down.
- My apologies.

2219
01:43:26,826 --> 01:43:29,638
Your Honor, I-I apologize. My client
doesn't know what she's saying. I'm sorry.

2220
01:43:29,662 --> 01:43:31,932
And they are trying to force us
to get an annulment...

2221
01:43:31,956 --> 01:43:33,809
- I-I am intoxicated.
- Sit quietly or begone. Please.

2222
01:43:33,833 --> 01:43:36,270
We got legally married at a legitimate
marriage place in Las Vegas, Nevada.

2223
01:43:36,294 --> 01:43:39,356
- Miss, please keep it down. Keep it down.
- It is real. We have a marriage certificate.

2224
01:43:39,380 --> 01:43:42,067
- Mr. Sharnov, take charge now.
- We're not gonna be signing...

2225
01:43:42,091 --> 01:43:43,527
They got married in Nevada?

2226
01:43:43,551 --> 01:43:45,571
- So what?
- We can't get it annulled here.

2227
01:43:45,595 --> 01:43:47,281
- What?
- Thank you for listening, Your Honor.

2228
01:43:47,305 --> 01:43:50,558
We can file for one but if you want
this now, you have to go there.

2229
01:43:50,683 --> 01:43:53,662
- Mr. Sharnov. Last time.
- Do you see what I've been dealing with?

2230
01:43:53,686 --> 01:43:55,164
Are you fucking kidding me?

2231
01:43:55,188 --> 01:43:57,625
- Folks, get out. Okay that's it.
- My stomach hurts.

2232
01:43:57,649 --> 01:43:59,249
- No, no, no, no.
- Have a seat.

2233
01:43:59,275 --> 01:44:01,712
No, no, no. Officer, get him off the table
before he throws up.

2234
01:44:01,736 --> 01:44:03,172
- I need... I need...
- Fuck!

2235
01:44:03,196 --> 01:44:05,436
- Come on.
- Get him off the table. Get him out.

2236
01:44:05,531 --> 01:44:07,092
- Fuck!
- Everyone out of the court.

2237
01:44:07,116 --> 01:44:08,802
Clear the court, Officer.

2238
01:44:08,826 --> 01:44:10,054
Come on, time to go.

2239
01:44:10,078 --> 01:44:12,723
- Let's go. Let's go. Let's go.
- Officer, clear the court, please.

2240
01:44:12,747 --> 01:44:14,916
- Why did you go to Vegas? Why not here in New
- York?

2241
01:44:15,041 --> 01:44:18,062
- Guys, you don't have to fucking drag him around.
- Why not here in New York?

2242
01:44:18,086 --> 01:44:20,526
Can you explain to me?
We got fucking married in Vegas because

2243
01:44:20,630 --> 01:44:23,525
- that's where he proposed to me.
- So now we're gonna go see your parents.

2244
01:44:23,549 --> 01:44:24,342
Vanya.

2245
01:44:24,467 --> 01:44:27,071
You're gonna explain to them
that you went to Vegas without my permission.

2246
01:44:27,095 --> 01:44:29,740
- No, we're not fucking going anywhere.
- You understand? Because it wasn't my fault.

2247
01:44:29,764 --> 01:44:30,640
- Vanya.
- You, too.

2248
01:44:30,765 --> 01:44:32,558
Oh, no, I am not going fucking anywhere.

2249
01:44:32,684 --> 01:44:35,746
You're gonna have to tell them that you-you
took him to Vegas without my permission.

2250
01:44:35,770 --> 01:44:38,690
- I am not going... No, no.
- No, no, no. I... - This is not my fault.

2251
01:44:38,815 --> 01:44:41,442
- No, we are, we are so...
- Get in the car. Get in the car.

2252
01:44:41,567 --> 01:44:44,213
I'm not getting in the fucking car, 'cause
we're fucking done here. And I

2253
01:44:44,237 --> 01:44:46,590
want my fucking ring now, motherfucker.
You got a ticket?

2254
01:44:46,614 --> 01:44:48,968
- What's going on?
- Vanya, get out of the car, okay?

2255
01:44:48,992 --> 01:44:52,036
You do not have to listen to these people.
Okay? You don't have to listen to

2256
01:44:52,161 --> 01:44:54,139
them because you're an adult, Vanya. You're an
adult, okay?

2257
01:44:54,163 --> 01:44:56,207
You had one job and you get a
ticket?

2258
01:44:56,332 --> 01:44:59,210
I must have dozed off. You dozed off! But I told
you not to fall asleep!

2259
01:44:59,335 --> 01:45:02,231
- Yeah, but are we done?
- You are an adult. You are an adult.

2260
01:45:02,255 --> 01:45:03,631
Let's go.

2261
01:45:03,756 --> 01:45:05,842
I just need
to talk with my parents.

2262
01:45:08,428 --> 01:45:10,888
Okay.

2263
01:45:11,014 --> 01:45:12,265
Okay. All right.

2264
01:45:12,390 --> 01:45:13,659
We'll talk
to your parents, okay?

2265
01:45:13,683 --> 01:45:15,226
We're gonna talk
to your parents,

2266
01:45:15,351 --> 01:45:17,162
and they're gonna understand
because they love you.

2267
01:45:17,186 --> 01:45:18,688
Get in.

2268
01:45:18,813 --> 01:45:20,565
What happened?

2269
01:45:20,690 --> 01:45:22,608
They got married in Vegas,
that's what happened.

2270
01:45:22,734 --> 01:45:25,212
They love you, and
they're gonna understand, okay?

2271
01:45:25,236 --> 01:45:27,113
Vanya, okay? Right?

2272
01:45:27,238 --> 01:45:29,282
- They're gonna understand, right?
- Get in the car.

2273
01:45:30,283 --> 01:45:32,723
- Get in the car.
- What are we going to do now?

2274
01:45:32,785 --> 01:45:34,054
This is a never-ending nightmare...

2275
01:45:34,078 --> 01:45:35,663
Right, Vanya?

2276
01:45:36,789 --> 01:45:37,915
Right?

2277
01:45:38,041 --> 01:45:39,459
Get in the car.

2278
01:46:02,482 --> 01:46:05,359
I want him clean
and presentable in ten minutes.

2279
01:46:06,569 --> 01:46:08,279
And, you, behave.

2280
01:46:15,912 --> 01:46:17,246
Once,

2281
01:46:18,039 --> 01:46:23,544
this idiot and his friends
decided to swim in Kool-Aid.

2282
01:46:23,669 --> 01:46:25,254
Vanya.

2283
01:46:25,379 --> 01:46:27,215
Do you know what is it?
It's a juice.

2284
01:46:28,216 --> 01:46:30,384
They were stoned

2285
01:46:30,843 --> 01:46:33,930
and poured four pounds

2286
01:46:34,472 --> 01:46:37,016
of Kool-Aid in the pool.

2287
01:46:37,558 --> 01:46:40,686
They destroyed the whole system.

2288
01:46:40,812 --> 01:46:44,982
Eighty-seven thousand dollars
in damages.

2289
01:47:43,708 --> 01:47:45,334
Hello, Galina Stepanovna.

2290
01:47:45,459 --> 01:47:47,003
Where is he?

2291
01:47:49,172 --> 01:47:50,882
Okay.

2292
01:47:51,007 --> 01:47:52,758
Showtime.

2293
01:48:01,767 --> 01:48:03,537
Nikolai Zakharov,
how was your flight?

2294
01:48:03,561 --> 01:48:05,188
Face down, ass up.

2295
01:48:05,897 --> 01:48:08,399
I have some bad news.

2296
01:48:08,524 --> 01:48:09,692
Go on.

2297
01:48:10,151 --> 01:48:13,654
- You're not going to be happy.
- I'm already not happy.

2298
01:48:15,823 --> 01:48:16,949
What?

2299
01:48:20,119 --> 01:48:21,495
Vanya. Vanya.

2300
01:48:22,997 --> 01:48:25,333
What's wrong with
you? Look at me.

2301
01:48:25,458 --> 01:48:26,918
Are you drunk?

2302
01:48:29,003 --> 01:48:29,795
Damn...

2303
01:48:29,921 --> 01:48:31,422
Garnik, he's drunk.

2304
01:48:31,547 --> 01:48:33,716
Yes, Galina Stepanovna,

2305
01:48:33,841 --> 01:48:36,510
he's not sober,
but it's not our fault.

2306
01:48:37,011 --> 01:48:40,514
Mom, I got it,
I'm already embarrassed.

2307
01:48:40,848 --> 01:48:42,225
- So, you're embarrassed?
- Yes.

2308
01:48:42,350 --> 01:48:43,684
So, you're embarrassed?

2309
01:48:43,809 --> 01:48:47,563
You made our family
a national disgrace.

2310
01:48:47,688 --> 01:48:49,649
Galina Zakharova,

2311
01:48:50,775 --> 01:48:52,652
I'm Anora.

2312
01:48:56,948 --> 01:49:00,618
It's so wonderful
to finally meet you.

2313
01:49:01,327 --> 01:49:04,455
It's such an honor
to be Ivan's wife

2314
01:49:05,081 --> 01:49:07,041
and a part
of your beautiful family.

2315
01:49:11,629 --> 01:49:13,965
Ivan is not your
husband,

2316
01:49:14,090 --> 01:49:17,051
and you are not part
of this family.

2317
01:49:18,928 --> 01:49:20,447
And your Russian is
embarrassing.

2318
01:49:20,471 --> 01:49:22,556
Is this from the
new collection?

2319
01:49:22,682 --> 01:49:23,474
Yes, new collection.

2320
01:49:23,599 --> 01:49:25,393
Uh, ma'am?

2321
01:49:27,061 --> 01:49:28,312
Ma'am?

2322
01:49:28,437 --> 01:49:30,189
Yes?

2323
01:49:30,314 --> 01:49:32,400
Vanya and I, we are in love,

2324
01:49:32,525 --> 01:49:34,986
and we would like you
to accept that.

2325
01:49:35,111 --> 01:49:37,154
Vanya is not in love with you.

2326
01:49:37,280 --> 01:49:39,073
Understand?

2327
01:49:39,198 --> 01:49:40,825
And we will not
accept it, okay?

2328
01:49:40,950 --> 01:49:41,993
Galina.

2329
01:49:44,787 --> 01:49:47,540
Toros has
something to tell you.

2330
01:49:48,833 --> 01:49:50,710
Fuck.

2331
01:49:50,835 --> 01:49:52,962
You are all idiots.

2332
01:49:53,087 --> 01:49:55,065
Vanya, we cannot get
on the fucking plane right now.

2333
01:49:55,089 --> 01:49:57,717
Toros, we will discuss
your future in our company.

2334
01:49:57,842 --> 01:50:01,345
Vanya, why are you listening
to your fucking parents?

2335
01:50:01,470 --> 01:50:02,847
What the fuck
is wrong with you?

2336
01:50:02,972 --> 01:50:04,812
Vanya, we have to talk
right fucking now, okay?

2337
01:50:04,890 --> 01:50:07,018
Kolya,
hang up the phone already!

2338
01:50:07,143 --> 01:50:08,745
Vanya, we have to
fucking talk.

2339
01:50:08,769 --> 01:50:10,938
No, no, no, no.
Go back to the plane.

2340
01:50:11,063 --> 01:50:14,900
I want us refueled
and in the air in ten minutes.

2341
01:50:15,568 --> 01:50:17,862
Vanya, fucking
look at me. Vanya.

2342
01:50:21,574 --> 01:50:24,702
Vanya, be a fucking man
and talk to me!

2343
01:50:24,827 --> 01:50:27,455
Is it necessary to
take the night butterfly with us?

2344
01:50:27,580 --> 01:50:31,125
Yes, both parties
must be present.

2345
01:50:36,255 --> 01:50:38,132
What do you want
me to say?

2346
01:50:43,763 --> 01:50:45,806
Can you understand
that now we must go

2347
01:50:45,931 --> 01:50:50,019
in the fucking plane
and fly to fucking Vegas?

2348
01:50:51,103 --> 01:50:52,605
Get it?

2349
01:50:54,690 --> 01:50:55,941
You get it?

2350
01:50:56,067 --> 01:50:58,277
So we're getting a divorce?
You...

2351
01:50:58,402 --> 01:51:00,821
Of course! Are you stupid?

2352
01:51:11,749 --> 01:51:13,376
Ivan, hurry up!

2353
01:51:13,501 --> 01:51:14,919
One second.

2354
01:51:17,671 --> 01:51:19,215
And thank you...

2355
01:51:23,010 --> 01:51:26,389
...for making my last trip
to America so fun.

2356
01:51:33,104 --> 01:51:35,189
Yeah? You had fun?

2357
01:51:36,107 --> 01:51:37,817
Yeah.

2358
01:51:37,942 --> 01:51:39,485
Let's go.

2359
01:51:54,250 --> 01:51:55,709
Where is she?

2360
01:51:56,127 --> 01:51:58,045
I don't know, there.

2361
01:52:03,801 --> 01:52:05,970
Board the plane now.

2362
01:52:09,014 --> 01:52:10,558
No.

2363
01:52:11,559 --> 01:52:13,519
No, I'm not doing that.

2364
01:52:20,067 --> 01:52:24,613
You are getting on this plane,
and you are getting divorced.

2365
01:52:27,741 --> 01:52:29,785
Yeah, we're gonna get
a fucking divorce,

2366
01:52:29,910 --> 01:52:32,329
but, uh, first,
I'm getting a lawyer.

2367
01:52:33,372 --> 01:52:35,624
Then I'm gonna sue Ivan
and you,

2368
01:52:35,749 --> 01:52:37,418
and I'm gonna walk away
with fucking half

2369
01:52:37,543 --> 01:52:39,378
because I didn't sign a prenup.

2370
01:52:50,598 --> 01:52:54,560
Do that,
and you'll lose everything.

2371
01:52:56,103 --> 01:52:58,272
Any money you may have...

2372
01:52:58,397 --> 01:53:00,941
although I doubt
you have much...

2373
01:53:01,066 --> 01:53:02,776
will be gone.

2374
01:53:04,028 --> 01:53:05,946
Do you have a house?

2375
01:53:07,573 --> 01:53:09,700
Do you have a car?

2376
01:53:11,243 --> 01:53:12,912
All gone.

2377
01:53:15,581 --> 01:53:18,584
Your life and the lives
of your family and friends,

2378
01:53:18,709 --> 01:53:20,586
everything will be destroyed.

2379
01:53:33,432 --> 01:53:35,434
You want to talk
about it now?

2380
01:53:35,559 --> 01:53:38,020
- Yes.
- Because I don't.

2381
01:53:40,481 --> 01:53:43,234
Please show some respect,
I'm hungover.

2382
01:53:43,359 --> 01:53:47,655
If we were your age, and if
we had everything we wanted...

2383
01:53:47,780 --> 01:53:49,823
Listen, you little shit.

2384
01:53:50,699 --> 01:53:52,326
Next week,

2385
01:53:52,451 --> 01:53:53,744
you start working.

2386
01:53:53,869 --> 01:53:55,246
Ah.

2387
01:53:56,372 --> 01:53:58,040
Understand, little shit?

2388
01:53:58,165 --> 01:54:00,042
Why do you need me there?

2389
01:54:00,376 --> 01:54:05,297
Maybe it's not the right moment
but I just want to say...

2390
01:54:06,048 --> 01:54:07,800
I'm very happy to finally

2391
01:54:07,925 --> 01:54:11,428
be able to spend time
with your wonderful family...

2392
01:54:11,554 --> 01:54:15,015
Thank you so much
for trusting me and Toros...

2393
01:54:15,140 --> 01:54:17,935
Stop it, get out of here.
Are you crazy?

2394
01:54:18,060 --> 01:54:21,605
I want to say a couple
of nice things to them.

2395
01:54:26,485 --> 01:54:28,696
Better you married a man.

2396
01:54:29,029 --> 01:54:31,407
So what if I married a man?
Do you think that can't happen?

2397
01:54:31,782 --> 01:54:36,120
Then what kind of freedom
can we talk about?

2398
01:54:36,245 --> 01:54:39,498
If I can't
potentially marry a man?

2399
01:54:39,623 --> 01:54:41,333
- Galina Stepanovna, I just...
- Listen!

2400
01:54:41,458 --> 01:54:45,754
I'm sorry,
I just want to use that moment

2401
01:54:45,879 --> 01:54:48,757
- to say thank you...
- Don't interfere!

2402
01:54:48,882 --> 01:54:51,010
We are having
a family discussion.

2403
01:54:53,012 --> 01:54:54,555
So you think it's normal?

2404
01:54:54,680 --> 01:54:56,056
Everything that happened
is normal?

2405
01:54:56,181 --> 01:54:58,434
How did you end up in Vegas?

2406
01:54:59,852 --> 01:55:01,353
I understand...

2407
01:55:01,478 --> 01:55:02,638
and forgive you what you did.

2408
01:55:02,730 --> 01:55:04,890
I just bought a
ticket and flew to Vegas!

2409
01:55:04,982 --> 01:55:06,066
Why can't I do that?

2410
01:55:06,191 --> 01:55:08,319
- Who gave you permission?
- Who would forbid me?

2411
01:55:08,444 --> 01:55:09,695
Great.

2412
01:55:09,820 --> 01:55:12,424
You talk about
freedom and then ask why I went to Vegas.

2413
01:55:12,448 --> 01:55:14,092
I'm so grateful
for your forgiveness.

2414
01:55:14,116 --> 01:55:16,118
Why can't I just
fly to Vegas?

2415
01:55:16,243 --> 01:55:17,563
Because you went to study.

2416
01:55:18,245 --> 01:55:20,414
Not to party,
drink and get hungover.

2417
01:55:22,041 --> 01:55:24,960
Why make a tragedy out of it?

2418
01:55:25,085 --> 01:55:29,089
What do you want from me?
Do you want me to apologize?

2419
01:55:29,214 --> 01:55:30,966
Just kill me, mom!

2420
01:55:31,091 --> 01:55:34,595
What did I do? I just spent
time with an escort.

2421
01:55:34,720 --> 01:55:37,848
I just spent a week with her.
So what's the big deal?

2422
01:55:37,973 --> 01:55:39,808
Why are you making this
such a big deal?

2423
01:55:39,933 --> 01:55:41,727
This isn't our family's
biggest problem.

2424
01:55:41,852 --> 01:55:42,853
- Sit!
- It's not

2425
01:55:42,978 --> 01:55:44,438
going to be a fucking problem.

2426
01:55:44,563 --> 01:55:45,689
I breast-fed you!

2427
01:55:45,814 --> 01:55:48,525
I'm fucking glad
to be divorcing your sorry ass.

2428
01:55:48,651 --> 01:55:50,027
You are fucking pathetic, man.

2429
01:55:50,152 --> 01:55:51,236
Are you seriously?

2430
01:55:51,362 --> 01:55:53,572
You're a pathetic motherfucker.

2431
01:55:54,907 --> 01:55:55,908
Fucking pathetic.

2432
01:55:56,033 --> 01:55:57,576
You're a pathetic motherfucker.

2433
01:55:57,701 --> 01:55:58,911
- Blyat, no.
- See?

2434
01:56:01,705 --> 01:56:03,832
You hurt your
mother so much!

2435
01:56:04,249 --> 01:56:06,585
I gave you everything.

2436
01:56:08,712 --> 01:56:11,215
Kolya,
give me your hand, please.

2437
01:57:13,610 --> 01:57:15,672
I'm just
going to need some signatures.

2438
01:57:15,696 --> 01:57:17,364
If I could just
get that back from...

2439
01:57:17,489 --> 01:57:19,241
Actually, if I could just
hang on to all...

2440
01:57:19,366 --> 01:57:20,927
- Could I just... Thank you.
- Okay, question.

2441
01:57:20,951 --> 01:57:22,679
- Okay. Yes, of course.
- What this mean?

2442
01:57:22,703 --> 01:57:24,303
We don't need
to worry about that.

2443
01:57:24,329 --> 01:57:26,665
- That's for the judge, so...
- Are you sure?

2444
01:57:26,790 --> 01:57:28,625
Um... Very sure.

2445
01:57:28,751 --> 01:57:31,044
Okay, so we're just gonna need
some signatures here.

2446
01:57:31,170 --> 01:57:32,963
So there you go,
and this one will be for...

2447
01:57:33,088 --> 01:57:34,673
Come here.

2448
01:57:34,798 --> 01:57:36,693
Sorry, I'm gonna
mispronounce your name.

2449
01:57:36,717 --> 01:57:38,437
- Sign.
- So, Anora Mikheeva,

2450
01:57:38,552 --> 01:57:40,596
I just need
your signature as well.

2451
01:57:40,721 --> 01:57:43,015
Thank you. Oh, oh.

2452
01:57:43,140 --> 01:57:44,308
There you are.

2453
01:57:45,642 --> 01:57:47,269
Where the red box is.

2454
01:57:59,406 --> 01:58:01,867
Sign, please.

2455
01:58:09,750 --> 01:58:11,835
And then...
oh, sorry... just one more.

2456
01:58:11,960 --> 01:58:14,129
Um...

2457
01:58:14,254 --> 01:58:16,548
Great.

2458
01:58:16,673 --> 01:58:17,925
Oh. Oh, um...

2459
01:58:18,050 --> 01:58:19,301
May I have my I.D.?

2460
01:58:19,426 --> 01:58:20,427
You can.

2461
01:58:20,552 --> 01:58:22,638
All right. Let's go. Come on.

2462
01:58:22,763 --> 01:58:24,306
This may be out of
line

2463
01:58:24,431 --> 01:58:27,684
but I think it'd be appropriate
if Ivan apologizes.

2464
01:58:29,812 --> 01:58:32,773
Don't pay attention to him.
He is tired.

2465
01:58:33,398 --> 01:58:35,692
He also drank on
an empty stomach on the plane.

2466
01:58:35,818 --> 01:58:37,110
He helped us all night.

2467
01:58:37,236 --> 01:58:38,236
Listen here...

2468
01:58:39,279 --> 01:58:44,076
My son won't apologize
to anyone. Is that clear?

2469
01:58:44,201 --> 01:58:45,702
Of course.

2470
01:58:45,828 --> 01:58:47,871
'Cause your son
is a fucking pussy.

2471
01:58:47,996 --> 01:58:49,248
What?

2472
01:58:49,373 --> 01:58:50,499
What? What?

2473
01:58:50,624 --> 01:58:53,585
What? Did you not hear what I said?
I said it's 'cause your son's

2474
01:58:53,710 --> 01:58:55,021
- a fucking pussy.
- That's enough.

2475
01:58:55,045 --> 01:58:56,255
Let's go.

2476
01:58:56,713 --> 01:58:58,513
And you are
a disgusting hooker.

2477
01:59:00,968 --> 01:59:06,014
And your son hates you so much
he married one to piss you off.

2478
01:59:06,139 --> 01:59:07,641
That's enough.

2479
01:59:07,766 --> 01:59:08,809
Yeah.

2480
01:59:08,934 --> 01:59:10,853
Yeah, your family
is fucking trash.

2481
01:59:10,978 --> 01:59:12,437
Is this my scarf?

2482
01:59:12,563 --> 01:59:14,648
Yeah, you want...

2483
01:59:17,776 --> 01:59:18,816
There.

2484
01:59:18,861 --> 01:59:20,904
Go get your little scarf, sweetie.

2485
01:59:21,029 --> 01:59:22,573
That's-that's enough. Let's go.

2486
01:59:22,698 --> 01:59:24,133
Mm-hmm. Oh, I'm leaving.

2487
01:59:24,157 --> 01:59:26,034
- I'm leaving. You know what?
- Okay. Let's go.

2488
01:59:26,159 --> 01:59:27,679
What are you
laughing at?

2489
01:59:27,744 --> 01:59:30,289
Why don't you take
your fucking coat, too.

2490
01:59:30,414 --> 01:59:31,915
That's enough. Let's go.

2491
01:59:36,670 --> 01:59:38,350
Thank you so much, ma'am.

2492
01:59:38,380 --> 01:59:39,965
You're very welcome. Um...

2493
01:59:44,928 --> 01:59:46,179
Goodbye, America.

2494
01:59:46,305 --> 01:59:47,514
Okay.

2495
01:59:47,639 --> 01:59:48,807
It's for you.

2496
01:59:48,932 --> 01:59:50,267
- Present.
- Sorry. Oh, gosh.

2497
01:59:50,392 --> 01:59:51,643
No, I couldn't.

2498
01:59:51,768 --> 01:59:53,248
Thank you so...
Wait, is-is this real?

2499
01:59:57,190 --> 02:00:00,193
Take them to
McCarran Airport, domestic.

2500
02:00:00,319 --> 02:00:02,571
Igor is gonna take you back.

2501
02:00:02,696 --> 02:00:04,114
You can stay
in the house tonight,

2502
02:00:04,239 --> 02:00:06,658
but you got to be
out of there in the morning.

2503
02:00:07,743 --> 02:00:09,745
And he'll pay you
when the bank opens.

2504
02:00:09,870 --> 02:00:10,954
Go.

2505
02:00:12,331 --> 02:00:13,957
And thank you.

2506
02:01:10,555 --> 02:01:12,795
And it
is starting to stick, as well.

2507
02:01:12,891 --> 02:01:15,477
We'll show you a live look
at the roads in a little bit,

2508
02:01:15,602 --> 02:01:18,002
but officials that we've talked
with today say they are ready

2509
02:01:18,063 --> 02:01:20,148
for whatever Mother Nature
brings the next few days.

2510
02:01:20,273 --> 02:01:21,593
We got thousands of

2511
02:01:21,692 --> 02:01:23,169
sanitation brothers and sisters
coming in

2512
02:01:23,193 --> 02:01:24,486
doing overtime tonight.

2513
02:01:24,611 --> 02:01:26,011
If it accumulates,
we'll be clearing

2514
02:01:26,071 --> 02:01:27,489
snow and ice from the street.

2515
02:01:27,614 --> 02:01:29,741
Every highway,
every bike lane in the city.

2516
02:01:29,866 --> 02:01:31,952
We'll be out starting
a midnight shift tonight.

2517
02:01:32,077 --> 02:01:33,797
On Long Island,
the salt trucks...

2518
02:01:33,912 --> 02:01:36,707
Happy birthday to me.

2519
02:01:36,832 --> 02:01:38,000
Hmm?

2520
02:01:40,836 --> 02:01:43,422
Was today
your birthday?

2521
02:01:43,547 --> 02:01:45,757
January is
National Blood Donor Month...

2522
02:01:45,882 --> 02:01:47,300
No.

2523
02:01:47,426 --> 02:01:49,136
...is urging people to donate.

2524
02:01:49,261 --> 02:01:51,471
Advocates say the winter months
are a crucial time...

2525
02:01:51,596 --> 02:01:53,265
Yesterday was my birthday.

2526
02:01:53,390 --> 02:01:55,726
The senior vice
president and chief of staff

2527
02:01:55,851 --> 02:01:57,370
at New York Blood Center,
Clarissa Heyward...

2528
02:01:57,394 --> 02:01:59,896
Yesterday was
your fucking birthday?

2529
02:02:02,190 --> 02:02:04,026
I was 30.

2530
02:02:05,902 --> 02:02:07,112
Mm.

2531
02:02:07,237 --> 02:02:09,239
Happy fucking birthday,
I guess.

2532
02:02:10,699 --> 02:02:12,451
Thank you.

2533
02:02:18,540 --> 02:02:20,584
I like Anora.

2534
02:02:22,961 --> 02:02:25,797
I mean I like Anora
more than Ani.

2535
02:02:28,091 --> 02:02:30,135
Okay.

2536
02:02:30,260 --> 02:02:33,305
Says the fuck head named Igor.

2537
02:02:33,430 --> 02:02:36,975
Fucking Igor.

2538
02:02:37,100 --> 02:02:39,770
Stupid name.

2539
02:02:39,895 --> 02:02:41,938
No, it's a good name.

2540
02:02:44,483 --> 02:02:47,319
It means "varrior."

2541
02:02:47,444 --> 02:02:49,321
Warrior.

2542
02:02:51,948 --> 02:02:53,950
Yeah?

2543
02:02:54,076 --> 02:02:57,079
Igor means "hunchback weirdo,"
you fucking piece of shit.

2544
02:02:57,204 --> 02:02:59,456
Can you shut the fuck up, please?

2545
02:03:02,834 --> 02:03:04,377
"Toosh."

2546
02:03:07,089 --> 02:03:09,841
- "Toosh"?
- "Toosh."

2547
02:03:09,966 --> 02:03:13,053
Touché?

2548
02:03:13,178 --> 02:03:15,639
Touché, motherfucker?

2549
02:03:17,390 --> 02:03:19,643
You know, you really should
try learning English

2550
02:03:19,768 --> 02:03:21,269
before attempting French.

2551
02:03:22,354 --> 02:03:24,106
Okay. Touché.

2552
02:03:24,231 --> 02:03:25,857
Yeah.

2553
02:03:31,113 --> 02:03:33,281
And your name is better?

2554
02:03:33,406 --> 02:03:35,117
No.

2555
02:03:35,242 --> 02:03:37,494
But what does it mean?

2556
02:03:40,914 --> 02:03:43,333
In America, we don't care
about that kind of stuff.

2557
02:03:43,458 --> 02:03:45,335
We don't give meaning to names.

2558
02:03:45,460 --> 02:03:48,255
It's... it's not a thing.

2559
02:04:18,577 --> 02:04:21,872
So, it means...

2560
02:04:23,373 --> 02:04:25,041
..."pomegranate fruit."

2561
02:04:25,167 --> 02:04:26,543
"Light."

2562
02:04:26,668 --> 02:04:29,296
Yeah, I'm not interested
in conversation, dude.

2563
02:04:31,548 --> 02:04:33,383
And "bright."

2564
02:04:44,853 --> 02:04:50,150
It's good that you're not
part of this family.

2565
02:04:54,988 --> 02:04:57,365
Did I ask for
your fucking opinion?

2566
02:05:00,994 --> 02:05:03,288
- No.
- No. Exactly.

2567
02:05:13,965 --> 02:05:16,301
I just tried to support you.

2568
02:05:19,054 --> 02:05:21,514
S-Support me?

2569
02:05:23,183 --> 02:05:25,143
Dude, you fucking assaulted me.

2570
02:05:25,268 --> 02:05:27,020
You... Fucking support?

2571
02:05:27,145 --> 02:05:29,397
- You... No, you...
- Oh. What?

2572
02:05:29,522 --> 02:05:30,941
No.

2573
02:05:31,066 --> 02:05:33,068
I didn't assault you.

2574
02:05:34,861 --> 02:05:38,156
You didn't...
You don't call that assault?

2575
02:05:38,281 --> 02:05:40,533
- No?
- No.

2576
02:05:40,659 --> 02:05:42,035
No, you're right.

2577
02:05:42,160 --> 02:05:43,870
It's fucking battery,
as well as kidnapping

2578
02:05:43,995 --> 02:05:47,666
and fucking a million
other felonies, I'm sure.

2579
02:05:47,791 --> 02:05:49,209
Fuck you, dude.

2580
02:05:49,334 --> 02:05:51,419
But, I didn't
assault you.

2581
02:05:52,212 --> 02:05:55,257
I was trying to calm you down,
so you didn't hurt yourself.

2582
02:05:55,382 --> 02:05:57,342
You fucking pinned
me to the ground.

2583
02:05:57,384 --> 02:05:59,135
You tied my fucking hands
behind my back.

2584
02:05:59,261 --> 02:06:00,929
You... you fucking gagged me.

2585
02:06:01,054 --> 02:06:02,472
Have you seen
the fucking bruises

2586
02:06:02,597 --> 02:06:05,433
on my legs and my fucking arms?

2587
02:06:05,558 --> 02:06:07,978
You fucking assaulted me,
you psychopath.

2588
02:06:09,104 --> 02:06:12,941
First, it's because
you have sensitive skin.

2589
02:06:13,066 --> 02:06:14,276
No, it's not.

2590
02:06:14,401 --> 02:06:16,361
It's because
you're fucking crazy.

2591
02:06:16,486 --> 02:06:19,948
And second,
because you're too crazy.

2592
02:06:21,825 --> 02:06:24,661
I mean "crazy, too."

2593
02:06:24,786 --> 02:06:28,540
But I can say
you're too crazy, too.

2594
02:06:30,041 --> 02:06:31,584
It's not funny, yeah.

2595
02:06:31,710 --> 02:06:33,420
Touché.

2596
02:06:34,379 --> 02:06:36,089
"Toosh."

2597
02:06:39,259 --> 02:06:41,928
But, anyway,
you were not in danger

2598
02:06:42,053 --> 02:06:46,641
of injury or harm, right?

2599
02:06:54,941 --> 02:06:56,568
You know,
if Garnik wasn't there,

2600
02:06:56,693 --> 02:06:59,571
you'd have raped me, guaranteed.

2601
02:07:01,906 --> 02:07:03,533
Raped?

2602
02:07:07,704 --> 02:07:09,080
No doubt.

2603
02:07:10,290 --> 02:07:12,917
Why... why would I
have raped you?

2604
02:07:16,504 --> 02:07:18,590
You have rape eyes.

2605
02:07:19,299 --> 02:07:22,510
- Raped eyes?
- Rape eyes.

2606
02:07:24,095 --> 02:07:25,180
You heard me.

2607
02:07:25,305 --> 02:07:27,849
You sick motherfucker
would've raped me.

2608
02:07:31,728 --> 02:07:35,190
Okay, uh, but I didn't want
to raped you.

2609
02:07:37,567 --> 02:07:39,444
Oh, yeah?

2610
02:07:40,612 --> 02:07:42,197
Why?

2611
02:07:44,866 --> 02:07:46,326
What?

2612
02:07:47,660 --> 02:07:49,120
Why?

2613
02:07:49,245 --> 02:07:50,914
What "why?"

2614
02:07:52,123 --> 02:07:54,584
Why wouldn't you have raped me?

2615
02:07:57,921 --> 02:07:59,964
Because I'm...

2616
02:08:00,090 --> 02:08:02,133
not a rapist.

2617
02:08:05,095 --> 02:08:08,723
Nope, 'cause you're
a faggot-ass bitch.

2618
02:08:28,743 --> 02:08:30,245
Here.

2619
02:08:34,249 --> 02:08:35,792
Goodnight.

2620
02:10:17,602 --> 02:10:19,062
Hey.

2621
02:10:54,097 --> 02:10:55,598
Don't tell Toros.

2622
02:11:50,612 --> 02:11:53,197
This car is very you.

2623
02:11:57,327 --> 02:11:58,870
Do you like it?

2624
02:12:04,959 --> 02:12:06,502
No.

2625
02:12:17,472 --> 02:12:19,515
It's my grandmother's.

2626
