00:00:00,253 --> 00:00:00,691
30 fps

2
00:02:01,250 --> 00:02:02,958
So, you ...

3
00:02:03,166 --> 00:02:04,500
Oh, courage! Shit!

4
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,750
No, no, no, no! Shit!

5
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,500
If you are lucky,
You experience this once in life.

6
00:02:18,583 --> 00:02:21,625
Damn, that
He went to ... perfectly.

7
00:02:21,833 --> 00:02:25,333
Yes, to me perfection. 
It happened to me twice.

8
00:02:26,916 --> 00:02:28,958
The first was when I met Josh.

9
00:02:29,041 --> 00:02:30,041
Ah, I'm Josh.

10
00:02:31,458 --> 00:02:32,458
I am Iris.

11
00:02:33,666 --> 00:02:34,666
And the second ...

12
00:02:36,833 --> 00:02:37,833
... the day I kill him.

13
00:02:41,125 --> 00:02:49,125
... Iris, wake up.

14
00:02:53,333 --> 00:02:57,916
... Hello, sleepy.

15
00:03:00,083 --> 00:03:01,250
How much I was asleep?

16
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:06,083
Ah ... a while.
You were deeply asleep.

17
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,541
I was dreaming of something so wonderful.

18
00:03:09,916 --> 00:03:11,583
Ah, yes? About me?

19
00:03:12,458 --> 00:03:15,333
Well, that's very pretentious, but ...

20
00:03:16,291 --> 00:03:16,458
Yeah.

21
00:03:16,541 --> 00:03:16,708
Yeah.

22
00:03:17,125 --> 00:03:19,916
And I didn't know. It was a sexy moment.

23
00:03:20,166 --> 00:03:21,666
No, depraved.

24
00:03:21,750 --> 00:03:22,791
A little sexy, right?

25
00:03:22,875 --> 00:03:23,875
No, it was ...

26
00:03:24,041 --> 00:03:26,166
No, I dreamed with the
day we met.

27
00:03:27,333 --> 00:03:28,958
Everything was so perfect.

28
00:03:29,708 --> 00:03:31,125
Do you remember how perfect it was?

29
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,541
Yes, no, no. How to forget it?

30
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:37,291
The supermarket, the oranges.

31
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,166
What road is it
this? It is not seen in the GPS.

32
00:03:46,625 --> 00:03:47,785
I don't think it's the road.

33
00:03:48,208 --> 00:03:49,448
I think it could be the entrance.

34
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
That?

35
00:04:56,291 --> 00:04:59,166
Iris, you can't
lie to me Tell me what happens.

36
00:04:59,666 --> 00:05:00,958
I'm going to do something stupid.

37
00:05:01,583 --> 00:05:03,875
I'm going to say something
idiot. I'm going to shame.

38
00:05:03,958 --> 00:05:06,375
They will laugh at me and they are going to
hate me. Surely they hate me.

39
00:05:06,458 --> 00:05:07,500
Holy God, Iris.

40
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,440
We plan the trip through
months. And you are telling me this now?

41
00:05:10,875 --> 00:05:12,291
Six meters from the door.

42
00:05:15,375 --> 00:05:16,375
Listen. Hey.

43
00:05:17,625 --> 00:05:18,625
My friends don't hate you.

44
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
But Kat, yes.

45
00:05:20,083 --> 00:05:22,416
Yes, it can be, but catodes everyone.

46
00:05:23,125 --> 00:05:25,208
I don't want to ruin the entire event.

47
00:05:25,625 --> 00:05:27,625
Vibob, you will not ruin the event.

48
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:30,000
Just ... relax.

49
00:05:30,708 --> 00:05:33,375
Ok? You are not depressive and rare.

50
00:05:33,666 --> 00:05:37,125
Don't forget ... no
Forget to smile and pretend to be happy.

51
00:05:37,791 --> 00:05:38,791
Ok?

52
00:05:40,333 --> 00:05:44,958
... Yay! You finally arrived.

53
00:05:45,041 --> 00:05:45,875
What are you doing here?

54
00:05:45,958 --> 00:05:47,833
Hey, when you said section, I thought you

55
00:05:47,916 --> 00:05:50,625
You refer to some
kilometers of the road,

56
00:05:50,708 --> 00:05:53,000
Not that it was far from civilization.

57
00:05:53,083 --> 00:05:55,083
Don't be so
Dramatic, Josh. You are not so far.

58
00:05:55,166 --> 00:05:56,291
Totally disagree.

59
00:05:59,875 --> 00:06:02,041
... Hello, Iris.

60
00:06:02,541 --> 00:06:04,208
Hello, Kat. What a pleasure to be here.

61
00:06:05,208 --> 00:06:06,208
Yes, a taste.

62
00:06:09,958 --> 00:06:11,267
Hey, they already saw who I found.

63
00:06:11,291 --> 00:06:12,291
Hello hello.

64
00:06:14,041 --> 00:06:14,541
How are you?

65
00:06:14,625 --> 00:06:15,708
Yes, look, welcome.

66
00:06:15,958 --> 00:06:18,791
I would hug you, but I have
Seafood hands. I'm sorry.

67
00:06:19,041 --> 00:06:20,666
Ok, well, I thank you.

68
00:06:20,875 --> 00:06:21,500
Where are you?

69
00:06:21,750 --> 00:06:22,750
You have arrived!

70
00:06:23,708 --> 00:06:24,875
Joshy Boy.

71
00:06:25,625 --> 00:06:26,708
Joshy Boy.

72
00:06:27,083 --> 00:06:27,666
Hi, friend.

73
00:06:27,916 --> 00:06:28,916
And which one you see?

74
00:06:29,291 --> 00:06:31,333
Hello how are you?

75
00:06:31,916 --> 00:06:34,041
Well, a little ... Hebrio.

76
00:06:34,625 --> 00:06:36,291
Yes, perfect. That's very good.

77
00:06:37,333 --> 00:06:39,791
Hey, Josh, do you remember to do gay?

78
00:06:42,916 --> 00:06:43,916
PRIVIET!

79
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,791
Hello, I'm gay. What a pleasure to see you.

80
00:06:47,208 --> 00:06:49,500
Likewise, friend. Likewise.

81
00:06:50,541 --> 00:06:53,833
And this beautiful creation must be iris.

82
00:06:54,458 --> 00:06:55,458
Hello.

83
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,625
It's a pleasure. I have heard a lot from her.

84
00:06:59,291 --> 00:07:00,291
Really?

85
00:07:00,458 --> 00:07:01,833
Good things, I hope so.

86
00:07:06,458 --> 00:07:08,708
Your Lake House is, in truth,

87
00:07:08,791 --> 00:07:09,791
It is an incredible place.

88
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:10,833
Yes, yes.

89
00:07:10,916 --> 00:07:11,916
It is very isolated.

90
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,375
The last place for the
We were going to 15 kilometers.

91
00:07:15,833 --> 00:07:16,041
A 27.

92
00:07:16,166 --> 00:07:17,291
And pay for this.

93
00:07:17,916 --> 00:07:20,041
Privacy is not cheap, my friends.

94
00:07:20,916 --> 00:07:21,833
Nothing cheap.

95
00:07:21,916 --> 00:07:23,250
Does the whole lake belong to you?

96
00:07:23,333 --> 00:07:26,083
No, don't be silly.
Only the earth around.

97
00:07:28,250 --> 00:07:29,333
But what do I offer them?

98
00:07:29,416 --> 00:07:31,291
What would they like?
Beer, cocktail, wine?

99
00:07:31,583 --> 00:07:34,458
I'm fine. Further
That nothing, I need a bathroom.

100
00:07:34,541 --> 00:07:36,083
What room do they have?

101
00:07:36,166 --> 00:07:37,958
Climbing the stairs through the hall.

102
00:07:38,041 --> 00:07:39,125
The last one to the left.

103
00:07:39,208 --> 00:07:40,833
I see you in a while.

104
00:08:47,125 --> 00:08:47,333
y

105
00:08:47,583 --> 00:08:48,583
Smile

106
00:08:51,708 --> 00:08:52,208
Without

107
00:08:52,291 --> 00:08:53,000
Be happy

108
00:08:53,083 --> 00:08:55,416
Or what continuous?

109
00:08:55,625 --> 00:08:56,875
The story continues

110
00:08:56,958 --> 00:08:58,416
I am in that

111
00:08:58,500 --> 00:09:00,416
Anyway, I had this

112
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:01,375
Dracula costume

113
00:09:01,458 --> 00:09:03,291
absurdly elaborated

114
00:09:06,958 --> 00:09:08,541
I was standing very close to the

115
00:09:08,625 --> 00:09:10,208
tempt in feet eating a

116
00:09:10,291 --> 00:09:11,041
Senaoria like this

117
00:09:11,125 --> 00:09:13,583
And something that seemed humus

118
00:09:13,666 --> 00:09:14,583
It wasn't humus

119
00:09:14,666 --> 00:09:17,958
It wasn't humus, I don't believe it but I

120
00:09:18,958 --> 00:09:20,833
Someone touched me on my shoulder

121
00:09:21,041 --> 00:09:22,625
and then turned

122
00:09:22,958 --> 00:09:25,250
I lived somewhat green

123
00:09:25,333 --> 00:09:26,541
and spongy

124
00:09:26,958 --> 00:09:28,791
A dinosaur

125
00:09:28,958 --> 00:09:30,041
staring at me

126
00:09:30,958 --> 00:09:32,875
and inside the costume

127
00:09:32,958 --> 00:09:34,458
I heard this voice very off

128
00:09:34,958 --> 00:09:36,416
And also very annoying that he said

129
00:09:36,958 --> 00:09:38,458
You are treading my tail!

130
00:09:39,541 --> 00:09:40,541
Then me

131
00:09:40,958 --> 00:09:42,125
I turned down

132
00:09:42,208 --> 00:09:44,750
And he was indeed stepping on his tail

133
00:09:44,958 --> 00:09:46,375
Dinosaur tail

134
00:09:46,458 --> 00:09:48,875
I went aside and apologized to him

135
00:09:48,958 --> 00:09:49,333
y

136
00:09:49,416 --> 00:09:51,291
He removed his head

137
00:09:51,375 --> 00:09:54,750
And it was when I looked at the most beautiful man

138
00:09:54,833 --> 00:09:56,375
I have seen in my whole life

139
00:09:56,958 --> 00:09:58,875
Did you know this

140
00:09:58,958 --> 00:10:00,583
beautiful man after thread?

141
00:10:01,041 --> 00:10:02,458
did you know? Close the mouth

142
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:03,208
did you know?

143
00:10:03,291 --> 00:10:03,541
Has seafood done it?

144
00:10:03,625 --> 00:10:03,958
That was

145
00:10:04,041 --> 00:10:06,541
I studied my bags?

146
00:10:07,041 --> 00:10:08,791
When did you realize?

147
00:10:10,666 --> 00:10:11,791
about what?

148
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:12,708
of

149
00:10:12,791 --> 00:10:15,875
who was chosen

150
00:10:15,958 --> 00:10:18,500
At that moment

151
00:10:18,583 --> 00:10:21,416
I know it's going to sound
cheesy but at the moment

152
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:25,208
in which we look at something inside me

153
00:10:25,291 --> 00:10:27,333
It made sense

154
00:10:27,416 --> 00:10:29,458
It doesn't seem cheesy

155
00:10:30,958 --> 00:10:34,333
But it's like

156
00:10:34,958 --> 00:10:36,875
This piece inside you

157
00:10:36,958 --> 00:10:38,708
that you didn't even know that I was broken

158
00:10:38,791 --> 00:10:39,791
one day

159
00:10:40,958 --> 00:10:41,625
suddenly

160
00:10:41,708 --> 00:10:43,458
will be repaired

161
00:10:44,958 --> 00:10:46,291
And you are

162
00:10:46,375 --> 00:10:48,916
You are seeing this stranger

163
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,291
to this person you had never seen

164
00:10:51,375 --> 00:10:52,375
y

165
00:10:52,958 --> 00:10:53,958
you already know

166
00:10:54,958 --> 00:10:57,208
that the rest of your life

167
00:10:57,291 --> 00:10:58,916
You will do anything

168
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,000
necessary

169
00:11:00,958 --> 00:11:03,041
For this person to be happy

170
00:11:03,125 --> 00:11:08,875
or not

171
00:11:08,958 --> 00:11:09,958
Ah yes?

172
00:11:10,291 --> 00:11:11,791
yes of course

173
00:11:16,958 --> 00:11:18,583

177
00:11:22,291 --> 00:11:24,666

178

179
00:11:28,958 --> 00:11:29,958

180
00:11:30,958 --> 00:11:32,833
Tell me Sergei, what do you do

181
00:11:32,958 --> 00:11:34,875
Ah you will see

182
00:11:34,958 --> 00:11:35,958
I'm

183
00:11:36,958 --> 00:11:38,916
in several pots

184
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:42,875
My hands are not clean

185
00:11:42,958 --> 00:11:43,958
My friend

186
00:11:44,958 --> 00:11:45,958
this

187
00:11:46,958 --> 00:11:47,000
is

188
00:11:47,041 --> 00:11:49,333
A business

189
00:11:49,416 --> 00:11:50,750
Very dirty

190
00:11:50,833 --> 00:11:54,083
Sergei says baby

191
00:11:54,958 --> 00:11:56,125
Oh yes

192
00:11:56,958 --> 00:11:59,291
He has everything you are looking for in a man

193
00:11:59,375 --> 00:12:01,166
If it is rich

194
00:12:01,250 --> 00:12:02,833
intelligent

195
00:12:02,958 --> 00:12:05,166
And he has a beautiful wife

196
00:12:05,250 --> 00:12:07,041
wife

197
00:12:07,125 --> 00:12:09,375
Sergei has a wife

198
00:12:09,458 --> 00:12:11,333
But they love each other

199
00:12:11,416 --> 00:12:12,791
You love each other

200
00:12:12,958 --> 00:12:14,250
What, love, no

201
00:12:14,958 --> 00:12:17,125
First I would have to see me

202
00:12:17,208 --> 00:12:18,208
like a human being

203
00:12:18,958 --> 00:12:21,083
I don't understand

204
00:12:21,166 --> 00:12:22,875
I am an accessory

205
00:12:22,958 --> 00:12:24,500
Like his damn car

206
00:12:24,958 --> 00:12:26,708
And, seen

207
00:12:26,958 --> 00:12:28,791
What he wants, sinus

208
00:12:28,958 --> 00:12:30,750
What he wants, lame

209
00:12:30,958 --> 00:12:33,458
When he wants

210
00:12:36,958 --> 00:12:40,291
Forget who I talk to

211
00:12:45,541 --> 00:12:47,250
I have not grade kat

212
00:12:48,958 --> 00:12:50,958
The issue is not that I do not thank me

213
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:53,333
Iris

214
00:12:53,416 --> 00:12:56,375
is what you represent

215
00:12:56,958 --> 00:12:58,500
makes me feel so

216
00:13:00,958 --> 00:13:01,958
replaceable

217
00:13:02,958 --> 00:13:04,458
replaceable

218
00:13:04,958 --> 00:13:06,750
nobody

219
00:13:06,958 --> 00:13:08,833
I could replace you

220
00:13:08,958 --> 00:13:10,250
Because you are kat

221
00:13:10,333 --> 00:13:12,875
You are very brave, he is inspiring

222
00:13:12,958 --> 00:13:14,666
I hope it could be like you but

223
00:13:16,958 --> 00:13:18,583
I was not done like this

224
00:13:18,958 --> 00:13:20,458
I

225
00:13:22,666 --> 00:13:24,541
I feel that there is always something inside me

226
00:13:24,625 --> 00:13:25,625
containing me

227
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:59,000
No, no, no

228
00:14:03,750 --> 00:14:07,750
Raise what itches up

229
00:14:08,958 --> 00:14:09,958
that is

230
00:14:10,958 --> 00:14:11,666
You already have it

231
00:14:11,750 --> 00:14:14,541
keep what it is

232
00:14:14,625 --> 00:14:15,083
Raise from above

233
00:14:15,166 --> 00:14:17,083
whose?

234
00:14:20,958 --> 00:14:22,958
UDO

235
00:15:00,166 --> 00:15:06,041
Ay good

236
00:15:06,458 --> 00:15:07,750
To Luis wanted Assassinar.

237
00:15:36,458 --> 00:15:37,458
No.

238
00:15:49,541 --> 00:15:51,458
I'm glad we have done this.

239
00:15:53,291 --> 00:15:55,791
Being here with you is perfect.

240
00:15:58,458 --> 00:16:03,166
I apologize if I was rare or depressive before.

241
00:16:06,458 --> 00:16:09,458
I just want you to be happy, Josh.

242
00:16:10,708 --> 00:16:11,083
That's all.

243
00:16:11,458 --> 00:16:12,666
Harish, take me.

244
00:16:29,583 --> 00:16:31,416
Outside the day is so divine.

245
00:16:32,958 --> 00:16:33,958
Can that the weather?

246
00:16:34,625 --> 00:16:38,958
Tempura 22 degrees and 83% of
probability of rain in the afternoon.

247
00:16:39,458 --> 00:16:40,625
It sounds so professional.

248
00:16:47,250 --> 00:16:48,250
Are you ready?

249
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:53,000
Sorry love, I need
Take a bath and many liters of coffee.

250
00:16:53,208 --> 00:16:55,875
Why don't you go there alone?

251
00:16:56,750 --> 00:16:57,791
But it was your idea.

252
00:16:58,958 --> 00:17:01,375
You said I wanted
Relax this morning near the lake.

253
00:17:01,458 --> 00:17:04,708
Yes, but it was before
That the hangover does not love me.

254
00:17:04,791 --> 00:17:07,500
It was intense last night.

255
00:17:08,375 --> 00:17:09,666
But you had fun.

256
00:17:11,416 --> 00:17:12,625
Of course, Bebop.

257
00:17:14,125 --> 00:17:15,250
He was amazing.

258
00:17:29,416 --> 00:17:30,458
Do you want me to wait?

259
00:17:32,041 --> 00:17:33,958
We could go to bathe together.

260
00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:38,083
No, no, you don't have to do it.

261
00:17:39,458 --> 00:17:40,458
You see alone.

262
00:17:42,041 --> 00:17:43,666
Enjoy this beautiful day.

263
00:17:46,458 --> 00:17:47,458
Ok.

264
00:19:01,458 --> 00:19:09,458
The end. Give me or thailand!

265
00:19:25,708 --> 00:19:26,708
Can I gedar the jaka?

266
00:19:32,083 --> 00:19:33,083
It's good morning.

267
00:19:34,500 --> 00:19:35,500
Ah, yes.

268
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,541
Bend another equally.

269
00:19:38,625 --> 00:19:40,958
Hey, your use is not bad.

270
00:19:41,541 --> 00:19:45,291
It's not good, but it's not bad either.

271
00:19:48,291 --> 00:19:49,291
Linda Vista.

272
00:19:55,750 --> 00:19:57,416
Ok, UVO, for love.

273
00:20:08,708 --> 00:20:09,166
Want?

274
00:20:09,375 --> 00:20:11,541
No, in fact, I will return home.

275
00:20:12,375 --> 00:20:13,541
As soon.

276
00:20:14,125 --> 00:20:17,083
Yes, Josh didn't feel good this morning

277
00:20:17,166 --> 00:20:18,583
And should go see how it is.

278
00:20:18,666 --> 00:20:20,916
Josh is already a
Man, you can take care of alone.

279
00:20:21,125 --> 00:20:23,458
Stay with Sergei and get company.

280
00:20:25,208 --> 00:20:26,875
I should go accompany him.

281
00:20:27,583 --> 00:20:27,791
And you?

282
00:20:27,875 --> 00:20:33,250
No no. And you
Like the Lake House?

283
00:20:35,333 --> 00:20:35,500
Yeah.

284
00:20:36,291 --> 00:20:38,458
And do you enjoy your stay?

285
00:20:39,375 --> 00:20:40,625
Yes of course.

286
00:20:40,875 --> 00:20:43,041
How guest, please?

287
00:20:43,875 --> 00:20:47,625
Stay, this
Russian old looking for company.

288
00:20:50,750 --> 00:20:51,750
Ok.

289
00:20:51,833 --> 00:20:52,833
Marvelous.

290
00:21:04,375 --> 00:21:08,125
Can?

291
00:21:08,375 --> 00:21:09,375
You could.

292
00:21:10,208 --> 00:21:13,291
Only the back and shoulders do not reach

293
00:21:13,833 --> 00:21:15,541
And I don't want to pronounce me too much.

294
00:21:20,625 --> 00:21:26,625
Ok.

295
00:21:35,041 --> 00:21:36,541
And the shoulders, please.

296
00:21:37,708 --> 00:21:38,708
Clear.

297
00:21:53,791 --> 00:21:54,791
What are you doing?

298
00:21:56,583 --> 00:21:57,625
There is no problem.

299
00:21:58,375 --> 00:21:59,708
It's Kat's idea.

300
00:22:00,208 --> 00:22:02,166
He told Sergei that you are here.

301
00:22:02,833 --> 00:22:04,083
And Sergei gives him permission.

302
00:22:05,875 --> 00:22:07,250
Take me, please.

303
00:22:08,250 --> 00:22:09,875
This is what you do, yes?

304
00:22:10,583 --> 00:22:10,791
For this you are.

305
00:22:10,875 --> 00:22:17,500
Hmm. More so.

306
00:22:18,291 --> 00:22:19,625
Please, no.

307
00:22:22,208 --> 00:22:23,208
I was open.

308
00:22:23,583 --> 00:22:23,875
Really?

309
00:22:24,291 --> 00:22:25,833
Yes, yes, you were a lebura.

310
00:22:26,166 --> 00:22:26,541
You too.

311
00:22:27,083 --> 00:22:28,083
And more opened than me.

312
00:22:28,125 --> 00:22:29,041
That doesn't happen to me.

313
00:22:29,125 --> 00:22:29,791
I have a gift.

314
00:22:29,875 --> 00:22:31,791
The others get drunk and I don't.

315
00:22:32,166 --> 00:22:33,166
They never happen to me.

316
00:22:33,250 --> 00:22:33,541
Really?

317
00:22:33,916 --> 00:22:34,250
Never.

318
00:22:34,333 --> 00:22:36,184
I could really drink
and do what I wanted.

319
00:22:36,208 --> 00:22:37,250
You only dehydrate.

320
00:22:37,333 --> 00:22:38,333
Yes, alone.

321
00:22:38,375 --> 00:22:38,791
What the hell?

322
00:22:38,875 --> 00:22:44,416
Oh, no. No no. What happened?

323
00:22:46,833 --> 00:22:48,208
It wasn't my intention.

324
00:22:49,500 --> 00:22:51,500
I wanted to overcome with me.

325
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,000
That?

326
00:22:54,583 --> 00:22:55,583
Sergei?

327
00:22:56,666 --> 00:22:57,666
Hmm.

328
00:22:57,958 --> 00:22:58,958
Paste.

329
00:22:59,291 --> 00:23:00,750
Sergei just wants to become a pleasure.

330
00:23:05,875 --> 00:23:06,791
I just wanted to stop.

331
00:23:06,875 --> 00:23:08,355
No. No. No. No. No. I was behind.

332
00:23:08,833 --> 00:23:10,125
Bye bye.

333
00:23:10,833 --> 00:23:11,833
Sergei

334
00:23:12,833 --> 00:23:15,125
Iris.

335
00:23:15,958 --> 00:23:17,000
Iris, look at me.

336
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:19,458
Tell me, what happened?

337
00:23:21,333 --> 00:23:22,333
I.

338
00:23:25,833 --> 00:23:27,333
That you get rid of.

339
00:23:30,833 --> 00:23:33,291
I had no choice.

340
00:23:41,083 --> 00:23:42,625
Sardine?

341
00:23:52,666 --> 00:23:53,666
King!

342
00:23:57,791 --> 00:23:58,791
Yuka!

343
00:23:59,208 --> 00:24:02,083
I didn't let go, you were fixing me.

344
00:24:02,833 --> 00:24:04,541
Diemen around five!

345
00:24:05,416 --> 00:24:05,791
Then don't worry.

346
00:24:05,875 --> 00:24:08,750
Come on! Come on! Come on!
So what is there, Ruiz? So you what?

347
00:24:13,833 --> 00:24:16,625
I tried to kill me and
The only thing I could think

348
00:24:16,833 --> 00:24:19,291
was that if they killed me
I would never see you again

349
00:24:19,375 --> 00:24:20,875
And that hurts much more

350
00:24:20,958 --> 00:24:22,625
than the torture of fixiandomas.

351
00:24:22,708 --> 00:24:25,666
I wasn't going to let it happen, no
I could let me turn away from your side.

352
00:24:25,750 --> 00:24:26,916
I love you! You will have!

353
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:28,000
Go, Ruiz! Go to sleep!

354
00:24:37,833 --> 00:24:40,833
Do not forget the ankles.

355
00:24:41,666 --> 00:24:42,666
Ok.

356
00:24:43,541 --> 00:24:45,375
Are you sure this will resist?

357
00:24:45,458 --> 00:24:48,416
Okay, it's not
Superhuman or anything similar.

358
00:24:48,625 --> 00:24:49,945
It is as strong as I allow it.

359
00:25:13,750 --> 00:25:14,750
Well, swell.

360
00:25:17,875 --> 00:25:18,041
Hello.

361
00:25:18,750 --> 00:25:19,000
Hello.

362
00:25:19,625 --> 00:25:20,625
How are you doing?

363
00:25:21,208 --> 00:25:22,708
He is asleep, he says before.

364
00:25:23,625 --> 00:25:24,625
A sedative?

365
00:25:25,208 --> 00:25:25,625
I think so.

366
00:25:25,875 --> 00:25:26,250
One way or the other?

367
00:25:26,333 --> 00:25:26,791
He fell asleep.

368
00:25:26,875 --> 00:25:27,041
Ok.

369
00:25:27,583 --> 00:25:28,041
Excellent.

370
00:25:28,375 --> 00:25:29,375
And now?

371
00:25:30,666 --> 00:25:31,791
What do we do?

372
00:25:31,875 --> 00:25:39,875
We can only call the police and tell them everything.
What do we do? Well, I will obviously need.

373
00:25:44,625 --> 00:25:45,625
You already know.

374
00:25:46,833 --> 00:25:48,375
I don't understand how it could have happened.

375
00:25:48,458 --> 00:25:50,166
There are no security measures for this.

376
00:25:50,250 --> 00:25:51,250
I have no idea.

377
00:25:51,875 --> 00:25:53,541
Was it a failure, maybe?

378
00:25:54,833 --> 00:25:55,833
Yeah.

379
00:25:56,666 --> 00:25:58,125
Ok.

380
00:25:59,416 --> 00:25:59,791
Ok, then ...

381
00:25:59,875 --> 00:26:02,309
What's happening? I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. No
HE. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. So...

382
00:26:02,333 --> 00:26:03,875
I will call the police and you go ...

383
00:26:04,500 --> 00:26:04,708
Yeah.

384
00:26:05,083 --> 00:26:05,250
Yeah.

385
00:26:05,500 --> 00:26:06,500
Yeah.

386
00:26:06,583 --> 00:26:09,125
I'm sorry, could you do it outside?

387
00:26:09,375 --> 00:26:10,375
Wanna...

388
00:26:11,041 --> 00:26:12,416
I want to say goodbye.

389
00:26:15,458 --> 00:26:15,625
Yeah.

390
00:26:16,166 --> 00:26:17,166
Yes, friend, of course.

391
00:26:17,250 --> 00:26:17,708
Yes, thanks.

392
00:26:17,875 --> 00:26:25,875
Oh, Riz, wakes up.

393
00:26:29,583 --> 00:26:30,458
I would lose myself without you.

394
00:26:30,541 --> 00:26:32,375
Hey, hey, hey, calm.

395
00:26:32,458 --> 00:26:32,833
Are you OK?

396
00:26:33,333 --> 00:26:33,833
Are you OK?

397
00:26:34,083 --> 00:26:34,458
Here I am.

398
00:26:34,750 --> 00:26:35,875
Hey, listen to me.

399
00:26:36,583 --> 00:26:38,666
God, wait.

400
00:26:38,750 --> 00:26:39,416
Why am I tied?

401
00:26:39,708 --> 00:26:40,458
Why am I tied?

402
00:26:40,541 --> 00:26:41,934
Oh, Riz, Ay, Riz, we had no choice.

403
00:26:41,958 --> 00:26:42,958
We had no choice.

404
00:26:43,041 --> 00:26:43,958
Did you blan up Sergei?

405
00:26:44,041 --> 00:26:44,125
Do you remember?

406
00:26:44,208 --> 00:26:45,208
No, no, no, no, no.

407
00:26:45,291 --> 00:26:45,791
It was in self -defense and was going to kill me.

408
00:26:45,875 --> 00:26:46,291
He was going to kill me. What's happening? No, no, no, no. What's happening? No,
No, no, no. What's happening? No, no, no, no. What's happening? What happens, k?

409
00:26:46,375 --> 00:26:47,476
It was in self -defense and was going to kill me.

410
00:26:47,500 --> 00:26:48,291
He was going to kill me.

411
00:26:48,375 --> 00:26:49,250
Do you have to believe me?

412
00:26:49,333 --> 00:26:51,250
No, I, if I believe you, oh, riz.

413
00:26:51,333 --> 00:26:53,053
Because you couldn't
Lying me even if you wanted.

414
00:26:53,791 --> 00:26:54,250
That?

415
00:26:54,708 --> 00:26:57,916
That part of your programming.

416
00:26:59,125 --> 00:27:00,000
Programming?

417
00:27:00,083 --> 00:27:01,250
What rays are you talking about?

418
00:27:02,458 --> 00:27:03,625
Ok?

419
00:27:04,458 --> 00:27:06,416
Sorry, there is no subtle form.

420
00:27:06,708 --> 00:27:07,916
Tell you, then,

421
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:11,291
I'm going to release it and without surroundings.

422
00:27:13,500 --> 00:27:14,500
You are a robot.

423
00:27:17,833 --> 00:27:18,833
As?

424
00:27:19,500 --> 00:27:20,500
You are a robot.

425
00:27:22,375 --> 00:27:23,750
Specifically you ...

426
00:27:25,208 --> 00:27:26,916
A company robot.

427
00:27:28,083 --> 00:27:30,750
A ... Company robot?

428
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:32,291
Yes, it's like ...

429
00:27:34,875 --> 00:27:38,583
I hate to say COGEBOT,
Because you do more than that, but ...

430
00:27:39,833 --> 00:27:43,250
You are an emotional support robot.

431
00:27:44,708 --> 00:27:45,708
What does it take.

432
00:27:47,750 --> 00:27:49,458
It's a joke, right? It's a joke.

433
00:27:49,541 --> 00:27:50,458
Iris, what is the weather?

434
00:27:50,541 --> 00:27:53,875
Temperature 22 degrees, 83% of
probability of rain in the afternoon.

435
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:00,958
Hey, are you convinced?

436
00:28:01,541 --> 00:28:02,541
Yes, ok.

437
00:28:03,833 --> 00:28:04,833
A second.

438
00:28:04,875 --> 00:28:07,083
Iris, do you know other languages?

439
00:28:07,500 --> 00:28:09,666
Can you talk Portuguese?

440
00:28:09,958 --> 00:28:12,125
Josh, does not use Portuguese yet.

441
00:28:14,291 --> 00:28:15,291
That?

442
00:28:15,583 --> 00:28:16,833
Or what is happening.

443
00:28:17,083 --> 00:28:18,958
YESHI? Ishi is the Mejujuy?

444
00:28:19,250 --> 00:28:21,291
I have to continue. I can do it.

445
00:28:21,750 --> 00:28:25,166
You have French,
You have Korean and you have ...

446
00:28:25,833 --> 00:28:29,208
I don't know what it is, you
Lugu, but apparently you speak it.

447
00:28:29,291 --> 00:28:31,041
I don't ... I don't understand.

448
00:28:31,666 --> 00:28:31,791
I...

449
00:28:31,875 --> 00:28:34,458
No, no, no, I have memories.

450
00:28:34,875 --> 00:28:40,166
University, works of
Summer, I've gone to Japan twice.

451
00:28:40,250 --> 00:28:45,250
Ok, look, what is,
That is, they are like memoirs.

452
00:28:45,500 --> 00:28:48,708
Enough to give you a background.

453
00:28:49,041 --> 00:28:52,541
The day we met in
The supermarket you, the oranges,

454
00:28:52,625 --> 00:28:54,875
That is not the line of a memory.

455
00:28:55,125 --> 00:28:57,041
Yes, it's false, it never happened.

456
00:28:57,250 --> 00:28:59,791
I chose it randomly
A list of meetings.

457
00:28:59,875 --> 00:29:02,625
It could have been in
any side, in a dog park,

458
00:29:02,708 --> 00:29:04,750
A library, in a market.

459
00:29:07,833 --> 00:29:08,833
Does that never happen?

460
00:29:10,833 --> 00:29:14,333
Ok, you, do you want to know
How was it? How did we meet?

461
00:29:15,250 --> 00:29:16,750
Children!

462
00:29:20,416 --> 00:29:20,625
Hello.

463
00:29:21,125 --> 00:29:22,125
Josh Beeman.

464
00:29:22,833 --> 00:29:24,041
Yes, it's me.

465
00:29:24,833 --> 00:29:25,833
Pass it, thanks.

466
00:29:32,875 --> 00:29:33,875
What do I feel?

467
00:29:35,500 --> 00:29:36,500
How are you?

468
00:29:39,833 --> 00:29:43,291
OK, this is the user agreement.

469
00:29:43,583 --> 00:29:46,041
Loyal or firm it at the bottom.

470
00:29:55,291 --> 00:29:57,791
So what do I do
When you start your program

471
00:29:57,875 --> 00:29:59,875
or whatever?

472
00:30:00,375 --> 00:30:03,791
When you synchronize with your
Telephone, you must create a love bond.

473
00:30:04,833 --> 00:30:05,416
A link?

474
00:30:05,500 --> 00:30:08,791
Yes, you must establish a
emotional connection between you and ...

475
00:30:10,833 --> 00:30:15,958
Iris, follow your voice commands
When you wake up, it is very intuitive.

476
00:30:19,458 --> 00:30:21,958
They know they are robots.

477
00:30:22,500 --> 00:30:25,791
Of course not. It will be obsessed
With you, your wishes, needs,

478
00:30:25,875 --> 00:30:27,916
And he won't even think about it.

479
00:30:28,291 --> 00:30:32,125
The experience is customizable, can
change the voice, eye color, intelligence

480
00:30:32,208 --> 00:30:35,250
And if you want to return to
Factory configuration,

481
00:30:35,500 --> 00:30:38,000
There is a sensor of
neck behind the right ear.

482
00:30:38,250 --> 00:30:40,708
Place the thumb
five seconds and restart.

483
00:30:40,833 --> 00:30:44,000
Then, you can
change your intelligence?

484
00:30:44,083 --> 00:30:45,125
Yes, but neglect.

485
00:30:45,208 --> 00:30:48,000
There is like one million
of regulations that

486
00:30:48,083 --> 00:30:50,375
They force to limit
His intelligence and strength.

487
00:30:50,708 --> 00:30:53,791
100% intelligence is equivalent
to that of a university graduate.

488
00:30:53,875 --> 00:30:57,000
The 0% would be that of an automata.

489
00:30:57,958 --> 00:30:59,791
It depends on the class of a couple you want.

490
00:31:00,208 --> 00:31:01,208
He can't lie.

491
00:31:01,333 --> 00:31:04,208
If you ask you a question,
She has to tell her the truth.

492
00:31:04,625 --> 00:31:06,666
And obvious
reasons, your programming avoids

493
00:31:06,750 --> 00:31:09,375
that hurts
humans, animals and other robots.

494
00:31:10,041 --> 00:31:11,041
Believe me, Mr. Viman.

495
00:31:11,333 --> 00:31:12,500
It is not what to worry.

496
00:31:12,833 --> 00:31:16,833
Iris is completely docil and
You can do what you want with it.

497
00:31:35,500 --> 00:31:43,500
To establish the
Link, please about

498
00:31:48,375 --> 00:31:49,851
Your face at 90
centimeters of my field of vision.

499
00:31:49,875 --> 00:31:51,250
of my field of vision.

500
00:32:07,416 --> 00:32:08,416
Please give your name.

501
00:32:11,833 --> 00:32:12,833
Josh ...

502
00:32:13,125 --> 00:32:14,125
Viman.

503
00:32:17,541 --> 00:32:18,833
Thanks, Josh Viman.

504
00:32:19,875 --> 00:32:21,250
Viman.

505
00:32:39,416 --> 00:32:40,833
The link was already established.

506
00:32:50,833 --> 00:32:53,416
Hello you.

507
00:32:56,250 --> 00:32:57,250
Hello.

508
00:33:06,458 --> 00:33:07,458
So...

509
00:33:07,666 --> 00:33:08,125
Do not invent.

510
00:33:08,625 --> 00:33:09,625
Yes, so.

511
00:33:09,916 --> 00:33:10,916
That is.

512
00:33:12,833 --> 00:33:13,833
Oh, God!

513
00:33:18,208 --> 00:33:19,208
I do not understand.

514
00:33:21,083 --> 00:33:26,375
I feel things to blame sadness.

515
00:33:28,458 --> 00:33:30,708
And I know how pain feels.

516
00:33:30,791 --> 00:33:31,791
It is programming.

517
00:33:33,041 --> 00:33:34,541
And so they make it look more real.

518
00:33:35,083 --> 00:33:36,916
Everything you do your whole life

519
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:38,833
It is only the imitation of a life.

520
00:33:40,833 --> 00:33:42,750
And right is perfect, ok?

521
00:33:44,125 --> 00:33:45,125
This...

522
00:33:45,458 --> 00:33:46,458
It's just water.

523
00:33:46,625 --> 00:33:48,791
It is a reserve in your body

524
00:33:48,875 --> 00:33:50,583
as brake fluid.

525
00:33:50,833 --> 00:33:53,708
They fill it every time
That I take you to your services.

526
00:33:54,208 --> 00:33:54,875
I'm going to vomit.

527
00:33:54,958 --> 00:33:55,958
No, you won't do it.

528
00:33:57,750 --> 00:33:59,000
There are programming visa.

529
00:33:59,083 --> 00:33:59,708
Already, enough.

530
00:34:00,041 --> 00:34:01,041
Stop saying that!

531
00:34:03,416 --> 00:34:04,416
You're right?

532
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:05,750
Yes, I'm sorry.

533
00:34:05,958 --> 00:34:07,416
It must be difficult to process it.

534
00:34:19,833 --> 00:34:20,833
Ok.

535
00:34:24,083 --> 00:34:25,083
Ok, what?

536
00:34:25,875 --> 00:34:26,875
I am not real.

537
00:34:29,458 --> 00:34:30,750
But I'm still yours.

538
00:34:31,833 --> 00:34:33,125
We can overcome it.

539
00:34:33,375 --> 00:34:34,666
We can return home.

540
00:34:35,666 --> 00:34:37,166
I will do what you want.

541
00:34:38,291 --> 00:34:40,166
I will cook for you and I will attend you.

542
00:34:40,250 --> 00:34:41,250
I will make love to you.

543
00:34:43,541 --> 00:34:44,916
I can make you happy, Josh.

544
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:46,833
I can make you very, very, very, very happy.

545
00:34:49,833 --> 00:34:50,833
No.

546
00:34:51,958 --> 00:34:52,625
Sorry, Iris.

547
00:34:52,791 --> 00:34:54,125
That, that can't be.

548
00:34:54,875 --> 00:34:55,875
Why not?

549
00:34:56,833 --> 00:34:58,666
You are already doing.

550
00:35:00,833 --> 00:35:01,083
Nothing.

551
00:35:01,333 --> 00:35:02,750
What the hell are you waiting for?

552
00:35:03,083 --> 00:35:04,166
Apágalo at once.

553
00:35:04,250 --> 00:35:05,250
Apágalo, shit.

554
00:35:05,375 --> 00:35:06,583
Cat Holy God!

555
00:35:06,666 --> 00:35:07,250
What are you talking about?

556
00:35:07,458 --> 00:35:07,666
Apágalo at once.

557
00:35:07,750 --> 00:35:08,166
Nothing, nothing.

558
00:35:08,250 --> 00:35:08,333
Only!

559
00:35:08,416 --> 00:35:10,083
Do you apologize?

560
00:35:10,166 --> 00:35:10,333
Josh!

561
00:35:10,416 --> 00:35:11,416
A moment, iris.

562
00:35:11,791 --> 00:35:12,000
Ok.

563
00:35:12,458 --> 00:35:12,875
Really?

564
00:35:13,125 --> 00:35:13,666
No, come.

565
00:35:13,958 --> 00:35:14,958
Josh!

566
00:35:20,791 --> 00:35:26,791
You can't do that, cat.

567
00:35:26,875 --> 00:35:28,795
You can't tell
A robot that you are going to pay.

568
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:30,000
It is not right.

569
00:35:30,375 --> 00:35:30,750
Really?

570
00:35:31,041 --> 00:35:33,583
You will see, I don't like surprises, Josh.

571
00:35:33,916 --> 00:35:36,000
This was not part of the plan.

572
00:35:36,083 --> 00:35:36,708
Yes I know.

573
00:35:36,916 --> 00:35:37,333
And I'm sorry.

574
00:35:37,625 --> 00:35:40,583
But look, considering
everything he has done for us,

575
00:35:40,666 --> 00:35:41,666
He owed him an explanation.

576
00:35:42,916 --> 00:35:43,916
Y...

577
00:35:44,333 --> 00:35:45,708
Ok, yes, I wanted to say goodbye.

578
00:35:46,083 --> 00:35:46,791
Is it seriously?

579
00:35:46,875 --> 00:35:47,041
It is a piece of plan. That? No,
No. No no. No no. No no. Oh really?

580
00:35:47,291 --> 00:35:50,541
It is a piece of
plastic with which you have sex.

581
00:35:50,833 --> 00:35:54,083
Goodbye to her is
how to say goodbye to the sock

582
00:35:54,166 --> 00:35:55,375
Where you masturbate.

583
00:35:55,458 --> 00:35:57,083
Hey, she is not a sock.

584
00:35:59,833 --> 00:36:01,333
The plan has not changed, cat.

585
00:36:01,625 --> 00:36:03,750
I'm just adding an extra step,

586
00:36:03,833 --> 00:36:07,250
a final goodbye and the
I will return to its normal configuration.

587
00:36:07,541 --> 00:36:10,333
And then I will pay it permanently.

588
00:36:10,583 --> 00:36:11,000
And then?

589
00:36:11,250 --> 00:36:11,833
And then nothing.

590
00:36:12,041 --> 00:36:15,041
We open a bottle of
Champagne and we wait for the police.

591
00:36:17,208 --> 00:36:18,208
The most difficult thing has happened.

592
00:36:19,833 --> 00:36:22,833
And, by the way, what a wonder, right?

593
00:36:23,208 --> 00:36:26,750
Because you plan and plan and
you plan and you know what will happen,

594
00:36:26,833 --> 00:36:28,916
But when finally
Pass, you just think what fucked.

595
00:36:29,833 --> 00:36:30,833
Wonder.

596
00:36:31,250 --> 00:36:32,458
We did it.

597
00:36:32,958 --> 00:36:35,125
We did it, we did it, fuck.

598
00:36:38,375 --> 00:36:40,166
Ah, ok, ok, very good, Jesus Christ.

599
00:36:40,250 --> 00:36:41,250
Yes, I'm sorry, of course.

600
00:36:41,791 --> 00:36:43,916
I'm sorry, I still can't believe it.

601
00:36:44,416 --> 00:36:45,791
Yes, I know, it's amazing.

602
00:36:45,875 --> 00:36:49,208
What damn it happens to you? By
What are you not just as excited?

603
00:36:49,291 --> 00:36:51,041
No, I am exciting me.

604
00:36:51,375 --> 00:36:55,000
Is that it is only the
Thin and a half pill a ...

605
00:36:55,625 --> 00:36:56,625
What did you take it?

606
00:36:56,916 --> 00:36:57,916
A sedative, Josh.

607
00:36:58,541 --> 00:36:59,750
And it is not wasted.

608
00:37:03,791 --> 00:37:05,750
Hey, I live, I am very sorry for all that.

609
00:37:06,583 --> 00:37:08,023
I assure you that everything will be fine.

610
00:37:10,333 --> 00:37:11,333
What are you doing?

611
00:37:11,875 --> 00:37:13,666
Shit, there it hurts.

612
00:37:16,833 --> 00:37:18,083
Aid.

613
00:37:20,833 --> 00:37:22,291
I hair so much.

614
00:37:30,833 --> 00:37:34,375
Needs ice and yes
There is inflammation, lack of air,

615
00:37:34,458 --> 00:37:36,333
civilance, agitation or drowsiness,

616
00:37:36,583 --> 00:37:38,416
Take it to emergencies immediately.

617
00:37:39,833 --> 00:37:40,833
Ok.

618
00:37:41,958 --> 00:37:44,833
Yes, it is tied
inside and will not go anywhere.

619
00:37:46,833 --> 00:37:48,750
Hila, spin, yes ...

620
00:37:48,916 --> 00:37:50,916
Oh, viz, I'm
Speaking by phone, I listen to myself.

621
00:38:01,250 --> 00:38:02,250
What am I seeing?

622
00:38:03,250 --> 00:38:04,250
A MOD.

623
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:05,458
A MOD?

624
00:38:05,958 --> 00:38:07,250
And what modifies?

625
00:38:09,583 --> 00:38:10,583
Oh, viz.

626
00:38:11,250 --> 00:38:12,851
It gives me access to parts of its programming,

627
00:38:12,875 --> 00:38:16,041
to which you generally do not have access.

628
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:20,833
Sorry, you unlock your limbot.

629
00:38:21,541 --> 00:38:22,541
What did you do?

630
00:38:23,333 --> 00:38:27,416
Increase your aggression and
its self -defense functions.

631
00:38:27,958 --> 00:38:32,625
And turn off the
programming that prevents it from hurting.

632
00:38:33,250 --> 00:38:35,875
But, but it escaped
Before I could restart it.

633
00:38:36,250 --> 00:38:38,375
If in Padix the
find before us,

634
00:38:38,750 --> 00:38:40,541
They will realize the changes and ...

635
00:38:41,291 --> 00:38:41,791
We are screwed.

636
00:38:41,875 --> 00:38:43,458
Hey, that means ...

637
00:38:45,166 --> 00:38:46,833
Did you kill Sergei?

638
00:38:46,916 --> 00:38:48,750
No, no, no, no,
No, I always I put Sergei.

639
00:38:48,833 --> 00:38:49,125
Ah, thanks.

640
00:38:49,208 --> 00:38:50,333
Did we only give him a push?

641
00:38:50,416 --> 00:38:51,416
It just can't be.

642
00:38:51,708 --> 00:38:52,416
No, spin, spin, spin.

643
00:38:52,500 --> 00:38:52,958
It just can't be.

644
00:38:53,041 --> 00:38:53,583
Do you have to understand?

645
00:38:53,791 --> 00:38:55,333
Hila, Sergei was bad.

646
00:38:55,416 --> 00:38:58,375
I was involved in all
Crime, drugs, weapons

647
00:38:58,458 --> 00:39:00,291
And even people trafficking.

648
00:39:00,375 --> 00:39:01,934
Not to mention that he was a terrible boyfriend.

649
00:39:01,958 --> 00:39:02,958
Yes, it was the worst.

650
00:39:03,041 --> 00:39:03,541
Because?

651
00:39:03,625 --> 00:39:06,125
I don't know, how to know what
caused me to do bad things.

652
00:39:06,208 --> 00:39:07,642
Maybe it had to do with its upbringing.

653
00:39:07,666 --> 00:39:08,851
No, Josh, why did you do it?

654
00:39:08,875 --> 00:39:11,208
Ah, yes, I'm sorry.

655
00:39:14,541 --> 00:39:15,541
Well...

656
00:39:23,833 --> 00:39:24,833
Do you know the key?

657
00:39:24,916 --> 00:39:25,916
Clear.

658
00:39:26,041 --> 00:39:28,583
The birthday of
Stalin is his key to everything.

659
00:39:28,833 --> 00:39:36,833
I see.

660
00:39:40,416 --> 00:39:42,083
How much money is there?

661
00:39:42,458 --> 00:39:44,750
Ah, a little more than 12 million.

662
00:39:48,333 --> 00:39:51,083
Holy mother smells delicious.

663
00:39:55,250 --> 00:39:56,791
Hey, if this trip was a trap,

664
00:39:56,875 --> 00:40:02,075
Don't you tell yourself that it would look bad? No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,
no no. If this trip was a trap for Iris to kill sergei,

665
00:40:02,375 --> 00:40:03,791
Why did they invite us?

666
00:40:05,416 --> 00:40:10,250
To corroborate the
history is more convincing

667
00:40:10,333 --> 00:40:11,333
With more witnesses.

668
00:40:11,833 --> 00:40:14,125
We are a couple of puppets, huh?

669
00:40:14,208 --> 00:40:14,416
No.

670
00:40:14,500 --> 00:40:14,875
How nice.

671
00:40:15,166 --> 00:40:17,958
Technically, yes, but that was the plan.

672
00:40:18,333 --> 00:40:22,125
In the new plan, everyone wins.

673
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:24,000
It is divided by three.

674
00:40:25,083 --> 00:40:27,750
It is divided by four, right?

675
00:40:28,291 --> 00:40:30,125
No, I meant three.

676
00:40:30,958 --> 00:40:32,375
But we are four.

677
00:40:32,916 --> 00:40:35,583
It's a joke, it's playing.

678
00:40:35,916 --> 00:40:38,041
You, I, Kat, Patrick ...

679
00:40:38,125 --> 00:40:38,375
What like.

680
00:40:38,833 --> 00:40:38,916
Josh.

681
00:40:39,208 --> 00:40:40,208
Patrick does not count.

682
00:40:40,375 --> 00:40:40,750
What are you saying?

683
00:40:41,208 --> 00:40:42,541
Wow, and in front of him.

684
00:40:42,625 --> 00:40:43,291
What a lovely one.

685
00:40:43,625 --> 00:40:45,184
Sorry, baby.
I regret that you heard that.

686
00:40:45,208 --> 00:40:46,448
Don't worry, it doesn't bother me.

687
00:40:46,833 --> 00:40:47,833
Patrick, Duémete.

688
00:40:48,833 --> 00:40:49,833
What a hell!

689
00:40:50,125 --> 00:40:51,325
Do you want to advocate my relationship?

690
00:40:51,541 --> 00:40:52,750
Of course not, friend.

691
00:40:52,833 --> 00:40:54,226
It is something important that is, Patrick.

692
00:40:54,250 --> 00:40:56,010
You could have it
changed to a new model.

693
00:40:56,833 --> 00:40:57,976
Do you want to talk to me about a dirile?

694
00:40:58,000 --> 00:40:58,250
Do you want to talk to me for my robot?

695
00:40:58,333 --> 00:40:59,791
Ylay, of course not.

696
00:40:59,875 --> 00:41:02,000
I like, Patrick,
But we will not give money.

697
00:41:02,333 --> 00:41:04,041
You are lucky to receive something,

698
00:41:04,125 --> 00:41:05,351
Although you did nothing in the plan ...

699
00:41:05,375 --> 00:41:07,083
What the hell did you contribute, huh?

700
00:41:07,166 --> 00:41:08,083
Air did everything.

701
00:41:08,166 --> 00:41:09,184
I left the knife in my pocket.

702
00:41:09,208 --> 00:41:10,375
I had to practice that.

703
00:41:10,583 --> 00:41:13,041
My knife should be
The easiest part of the plan

704
00:41:13,125 --> 00:41:14,291
No honest tesorio.

705
00:41:14,375 --> 00:41:15,434
How did you know that I was going to find it?

706
00:41:15,458 --> 00:41:17,666
I don't know, there was never
orchestrated a homicide

707
00:41:17,750 --> 00:41:18,250
And it's not ...

708
00:41:18,333 --> 00:41:18,875
Yes, Lota!

709
00:41:19,250 --> 00:41:20,250
Killos!

710
00:41:21,500 --> 00:41:21,791
Ylay?

711
00:41:21,875 --> 00:41:22,875
Yeah?

712
00:41:23,416 --> 00:41:26,458
We offer you 4 million dollars

713
00:41:26,541 --> 00:41:28,416
And you just have to help us

714
00:41:28,500 --> 00:41:30,500
To find a robot in the forest.

715
00:41:33,833 --> 00:41:35,708
It is not a bad business.

716
00:41:38,833 --> 00:41:39,833
Good.

717
00:41:51,250 --> 00:41:52,250
But...

718
00:41:52,666 --> 00:41:53,706
I want them to give me the gun.

719
00:41:55,833 --> 00:41:57,958
You will see, Eli will not be necessary

720
00:41:58,041 --> 00:42:00,333
Because I only have
that approach to sleep it,

721
00:42:00,416 --> 00:42:02,500
take my phone and
Remove the mod of your system,

722
00:42:02,583 --> 00:42:03,791
So we will be fine.

723
00:42:04,458 --> 00:42:05,458
Do you have your phone?

724
00:42:07,125 --> 00:42:08,125
Yeah.

725
00:42:10,833 --> 00:42:12,041
Do you know your password?

726
00:42:15,250 --> 00:42:16,250
Yosh?

727
00:42:16,833 --> 00:42:18,375
Do you know your password?

728
00:42:18,833 --> 00:42:21,750
Yes, she knows everything about me.

729
00:42:23,791 --> 00:42:25,458
Yes, I think we will need it.

730
00:42:27,833 --> 00:42:29,666
Patrick, wakes up.

731
00:42:30,750 --> 00:42:31,208
Hi babe.

732
00:42:31,458 --> 00:42:31,833
Hello.

733
00:42:32,125 --> 00:42:33,625
You have to marry a robot, yes.

734
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:35,458
Is it inventive, right?

735
00:42:35,750 --> 00:42:36,750
Clear.

736
00:42:37,166 --> 00:42:38,166
Yosh?

737
00:42:39,833 --> 00:42:41,153
What can you do with your phone?

738
00:42:48,833 --> 00:42:49,833
No no.

739
00:43:12,041 --> 00:43:13,041
Hello.

740
00:43:14,916 --> 00:43:15,916
Hello.

741
00:43:18,500 --> 00:43:19,500
Hello.

742
00:43:27,833 --> 00:43:28,833
Wow, Josh.

743
00:43:51,708 --> 00:43:59,708
That?

744
00:44:02,166 --> 00:44:03,166
Damn, Aunt Josh.

745
00:44:03,250 --> 00:44:04,583
We have been walking for years.

746
00:44:04,833 --> 00:44:07,041
Isn't there an app of find, my limbot?

747
00:44:07,125 --> 00:44:09,000
Yes, there is one, but guess,

748
00:44:09,250 --> 00:44:11,041
is on my phone and say ...

749
00:44:11,125 --> 00:44:11,791
Can you get with the Josh?

750
00:44:11,875 --> 00:44:12,958
They stop shouting.

751
00:44:13,041 --> 00:44:14,666
We know in which direction it moved.

752
00:44:14,833 --> 00:44:16,875
No, you have to separate.

753
00:44:17,125 --> 00:44:18,791
Thus we can attack it from ...

754
00:44:19,875 --> 00:44:21,625
Two different angles, right?

755
00:44:21,708 --> 00:44:22,208
Like a pizza.

756
00:44:22,291 --> 00:44:23,208
Different angles!

757
00:44:23,291 --> 00:44:23,791
What are you doing?

758
00:44:23,875 --> 00:44:25,083
And there, Patrick?

759
00:44:25,166 --> 00:44:26,291
You go there.

760
00:44:27,125 --> 00:44:28,250
Cati, we will go here.

761
00:44:28,708 --> 00:44:28,916
Yeah?

762
00:44:29,375 --> 00:44:30,750
Cati, will they go there?

763
00:44:35,416 --> 00:44:36,458
Do you go to bed?

764
00:44:36,541 --> 00:44:37,083
Disgusting?

765
00:44:37,291 --> 00:44:37,708
Disgusting?

766
00:44:37,958 --> 00:44:38,958
Disgusting?

767
00:44:45,833 --> 00:44:46,833
Ok.

768
00:44:48,291 --> 00:44:50,250
Now that Iris thinks,

769
00:44:50,791 --> 00:44:53,625
Use 60% extra intelligence.

770
00:44:54,208 --> 00:44:57,000
You have to go home, look for money,

771
00:44:57,291 --> 00:44:58,750
clothes and then clean you.

772
00:44:58,833 --> 00:44:59,833
How will you do that?

773
00:45:02,833 --> 00:45:05,750
The question is to find the way

774
00:45:05,833 --> 00:45:08,166
to the road and ask to take you.

775
00:45:11,916 --> 00:45:12,916
What the hell?

776
00:45:15,625 --> 00:45:17,958
Ok, they won't stop.

777
00:45:19,875 --> 00:45:21,625
You could go on foot,

778
00:45:22,458 --> 00:45:25,000
160 kilometers in irregular terrain.

779
00:45:25,083 --> 00:45:26,625
It would take days and when you come back ...

780
00:45:29,416 --> 00:45:30,416
Welcome, Bebop.

781
00:45:32,833 --> 00:45:34,833
I will not walk.

782
00:45:38,125 --> 00:45:39,250
You have Josh's phone.

783
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:42,833
The phone controls you ...

784
00:45:44,875 --> 00:45:46,416
But also control ...

785
00:45:51,833 --> 00:45:52,833
Good afternoon.

786
00:45:53,083 --> 00:45:54,458
Where would you like to go today?

787
00:45:54,708 --> 00:45:55,708
To the house.

788
00:45:55,833 --> 00:45:56,958
Addressing home.

789
00:45:57,583 --> 00:46:00,791
And I must add that
It is a fantastic plan, Iris.

790
00:46:02,833 --> 00:46:04,125
Thanks, Josh's car.

791
00:46:07,833 --> 00:46:10,000
You just have to return through the forest.

792
00:46:10,833 --> 00:46:12,791
Get to the house of
Lake without killing Josh

793
00:46:12,875 --> 00:46:14,583
And his friends and you will be safe.

794
00:46:17,166 --> 00:46:21,416
Where do you find it?

795
00:46:21,750 --> 00:46:22,750
In your closet.

796
00:46:23,833 --> 00:46:25,208
I thought, I bought a very hunter.

797
00:46:25,833 --> 00:46:26,250
It fits well?

798
00:46:26,833 --> 00:46:28,666
Thanks to you, everything would look good.

799
00:46:28,750 --> 00:46:30,458
Really, I swear everything.

800
00:46:30,541 --> 00:46:31,708
You look divine any ...

801
00:46:32,375 --> 00:46:32,791
Vest that ...

802
00:46:32,875 --> 00:46:33,875
That?

803
00:46:35,166 --> 00:46:36,166
Did you hear?

804
00:46:37,833 --> 00:46:38,833
No, what.

805
00:46:40,333 --> 00:46:43,291
Is my reason that is
saying that this is stupidity.

806
00:46:44,583 --> 00:46:45,642
Do you think we will not find it?

807
00:46:45,666 --> 00:46:47,041
I don't know, and I really don't care.

808
00:46:47,500 --> 00:46:49,625
Let's let Josh and
Kat take care of her.

809
00:46:50,208 --> 00:46:51,892
Does it bother you no
Will they include you in the plan?

810
00:46:51,916 --> 00:46:53,291
If the situation were the other way around,

811
00:46:53,375 --> 00:46:54,791
If you had altered your programming

812
00:46:54,875 --> 00:46:56,708
To kill a guy
and steal his millions,

813
00:46:56,958 --> 00:46:59,208
would have included Josh
In the plan from the beginning.

814
00:46:59,458 --> 00:47:01,098
I would have done it because I am a good friend.

815
00:47:01,125 --> 00:47:01,791
That makes friends,
They are included in their plans.

816
00:47:01,875 --> 00:47:04,916
That if you were a robot.

817
00:47:05,875 --> 00:47:06,875
Obviously.

818
00:47:07,291 --> 00:47:08,291
Obviously.

819
00:47:08,541 --> 00:47:08,958
In the end,

820
00:47:09,458 --> 00:47:11,791
I'm tired, I'm hungry

821
00:47:11,875 --> 00:47:14,416
And loading this weapon makes me very hot.

822
00:47:14,500 --> 00:47:15,500
So...

823
00:47:15,541 --> 00:47:17,375
Let's go to the cabin to have sex

824
00:47:17,458 --> 00:47:18,666
Since you make me a homelet.

825
00:47:19,500 --> 00:47:20,500
Come on.

826
00:47:23,625 --> 00:47:24,958
But would you never do that to me, Uzi?

827
00:47:25,750 --> 00:47:26,750
What thing?

828
00:47:27,041 --> 00:47:28,041
You don't ...

829
00:47:28,208 --> 00:47:29,328
Would you alter my programming?

830
00:47:29,625 --> 00:47:33,916
What are you talking about, baby?

831
00:47:37,166 --> 00:47:38,583
And I did it, I'm a robot.

832
00:47:40,500 --> 00:47:41,500
As?

833
00:47:41,791 --> 00:47:43,625
I realized over the years.

834
00:47:44,458 --> 00:47:45,458
You can't lie.

835
00:47:45,875 --> 00:47:46,875
I don't understand.

836
00:47:47,416 --> 00:47:49,291
Yesterday you told you how we met

837
00:47:49,375 --> 00:47:50,833
As if it had happened.

838
00:47:50,916 --> 00:47:51,916
Why is it real?

839
00:47:53,875 --> 00:47:55,375
Maybe it never happened, but ...

840
00:47:55,833 --> 00:48:01,625
My memory is real. I close my eyes

841
00:48:01,708 --> 00:48:01,791
And I see it

842
00:48:01,875 --> 00:48:09,875
clearly. Hey.

843
00:48:28,125 --> 00:48:29,125
Hey.

844
00:48:29,833 --> 00:48:31,166
You are step on, Nicola.

845
00:48:32,208 --> 00:48:32,458
That?

846
00:48:32,833 --> 00:48:34,750
You are step on, Nicola.

847
00:48:35,583 --> 00:48:36,208
Sorry.

848
00:48:36,541 --> 00:48:36,750
That?

849
00:48:36,958 --> 00:48:37,958
I'm sorry.

850
00:48:41,625 --> 00:48:42,625
Hello.

851
00:48:43,833 --> 00:48:44,833
Hello.

852
00:48:47,250 --> 00:48:48,250
I am Eli.

853
00:48:50,666 --> 00:48:51,666
And I Patrick.

854
00:48:55,875 --> 00:48:57,541
I know I love him.

855
00:48:57,791 --> 00:48:58,791
I am you.

856
00:48:58,958 --> 00:49:00,208
It sounds to me is me.

857
00:49:00,291 --> 00:49:01,583
I like that I love him.

858
00:49:05,833 --> 00:49:08,083
Baby, you know that it would never hurt you

859
00:49:08,166 --> 00:49:10,583
And that would never treat you
As I am Iris, right?

860
00:49:10,666 --> 00:49:11,291
I know that.

861
00:49:11,375 --> 00:49:12,375
Why do I love you?

862
00:49:12,791 --> 00:49:14,916
It's crazy to say so, right?

863
00:49:17,833 --> 00:49:18,833
It is true.

864
00:49:19,833 --> 00:49:21,166
Do you feel how much I love you?

865
00:49:21,666 --> 00:49:22,666
Yes of course.

866
00:49:24,625 --> 00:49:25,625
How do you feel?

867
00:49:28,166 --> 00:49:30,291
I don't know how to describe something like that.

868
00:49:31,375 --> 00:49:32,583
Try it.

869
00:49:36,291 --> 00:49:37,291
It's like pain.

870
00:49:39,333 --> 00:49:40,333
As...

871
00:49:41,416 --> 00:49:43,375
If my interior were in flames,

872
00:49:45,041 --> 00:49:46,041
that wipe ...

873
00:49:47,291 --> 00:49:48,291
violence...

874
00:49:49,750 --> 00:49:50,750
and brightness.

875
00:49:55,833 --> 00:49:56,833
No.

876
00:50:14,458 --> 00:50:16,208
Santa Mother, I fell in love with a robot.

877
00:50:16,291 --> 00:50:17,331
You fell in love with a robot.

878
00:50:41,416 --> 00:50:41,833
That?

879
00:50:41,916 --> 00:50:42,916
Iris.

880
00:50:44,625 --> 00:50:45,625
Iris?

881
00:50:46,458 --> 00:50:46,708
Eli.

882
00:50:47,208 --> 00:50:48,208
SUSPEND!

883
00:50:57,291 --> 00:50:59,416
Au!

884
00:51:00,166 --> 00:51:01,666
Shit! How noisy!

885
00:51:02,625 --> 00:51:03,625
Law!

886
00:51:38,625 --> 00:51:38,916
Ah!

887
00:51:39,541 --> 00:51:39,791
Shit!

888
00:51:39,875 --> 00:51:47,875
Ah!

889
00:51:55,333 --> 00:51:57,000
This is not personal, iris.

890
00:51:57,416 --> 00:51:58,750
I am your ally, nor the ...

891
00:51:59,833 --> 00:52:02,833
But it's too money, fuck!

892
00:52:15,625 --> 00:52:16,208
And is there?

893
00:52:16,625 --> 00:52:17,625
And is there?

894
00:52:21,833 --> 00:52:22,833
Patrick, me ...

895
00:52:23,750 --> 00:52:24,750
I'm sorry.

896
00:52:26,458 --> 00:52:29,208
It just can't be.

897
00:52:29,291 --> 00:52:30,541
Iris! Duémete!

898
00:52:32,916 --> 00:52:33,916
Shit!

899
00:52:37,125 --> 00:52:38,125
Iris!

900
00:52:45,333 --> 00:52:46,333
Iris!

901
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:54,000
Iris!

902
00:52:56,208 --> 00:52:57,208
Iris!

903
00:52:57,250 --> 00:53:05,250
Ah! Ah! Ah!

904
00:53:06,500 --> 00:53:08,416
Ah!

905
00:53:08,500 --> 00:53:08,708
Oh, look!

906
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:10,000
Open the door!

907
00:53:11,375 --> 00:53:12,458
Open the Mantida Door!

908
00:53:13,250 --> 00:53:14,250
Good afternoon.

909
00:53:14,625 --> 00:53:15,666
Where would you like to go?

910
00:53:15,750 --> 00:53:16,083
Home!

911
00:53:16,541 --> 00:53:17,541
I home!

912
00:53:18,833 --> 00:53:20,875
An unrecognized voice donus!

913
00:53:20,958 --> 00:53:21,958
I home!

914
00:53:22,875 --> 00:53:25,208
An unrecognized voice donus!

915
00:53:25,291 --> 00:53:25,791
Jabilita!

916
00:53:25,875 --> 00:53:27,833
The manual driving mode!

917
00:53:27,916 --> 00:53:29,791
An unknown voice donus!

918
00:53:35,916 --> 00:53:40,750
Iris, you will not go anywhere.

919
00:53:41,500 --> 00:53:42,625
Get out of the car, please.

920
00:53:42,708 --> 00:53:44,333
Don't make it more difficult than it is.

921
00:53:48,500 --> 00:53:49,500
Get out now.

922
00:53:51,750 --> 00:53:52,750
Keep it up.

923
00:53:54,291 --> 00:53:54,791
Keep it up.

924
00:53:54,875 --> 00:53:56,458
What is happening, Iris?

925
00:53:57,833 --> 00:53:58,833
Keep it up.

926
00:53:58,916 --> 00:53:59,916
Keep it up.

927
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:00,666
I saw the house.

928
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:02,791
An unrecognized voice donus!

929
00:54:03,958 --> 00:54:04,958
Keep it up.

930
00:54:05,875 --> 00:54:06,875
I saw the house.

931
00:54:06,916 --> 00:54:08,791
An unrecognized voice donus!

932
00:54:10,833 --> 00:54:11,833
Keep it up.

933
00:54:11,916 --> 00:54:12,916
Keep it up.

934
00:54:13,291 --> 00:54:14,000
I saw the house.

935
00:54:14,083 --> 00:54:15,916
An unknown voice donus!

936
00:54:16,375 --> 00:54:16,916
Keep it up.

937
00:54:17,250 --> 00:54:19,833
Keep it up.

938
00:54:20,833 --> 00:54:22,583
Keep it up.

939
00:54:22,916 --> 00:54:23,583
Via home.

940
00:54:23,875 --> 00:54:26,666
Keep it up! House shit!

941
00:54:27,375 --> 00:54:30,833
Keep it up! House shit!

942
00:54:32,291 --> 00:54:35,875
Shit! Shit!

943
00:54:42,833 --> 00:54:44,125
Algües!

944
00:54:53,833 --> 00:54:55,166
The phone! The phone!

945
00:54:56,708 --> 00:54:57,916
Ah, I continued on your phone!

946
00:55:00,166 --> 00:55:01,166
Yeah!

947
00:55:02,833 --> 00:55:03,833
Yeah!

948
00:55:06,833 --> 00:55:07,833
Shit!

949
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:11,916
Stalin's birthday!

950
00:55:13,125 --> 00:55:15,708
When, when it is
Stalin's birthday!

951
00:55:16,250 --> 00:55:20,583
Ok! Yes, yes!

952
00:55:24,833 --> 00:55:28,000
No, no, no, no.

953
00:55:28,625 --> 00:55:30,000
No, no, no, no, no. What are you doing?

954
00:55:30,083 --> 00:55:31,708
ABLECT, OPENING.

955
00:55:31,791 --> 00:55:34,333
The owner of this
vehicle has reported it as stolen,

956
00:55:34,416 --> 00:55:35,916
Activated emergency switch.

957
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:37,083
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

958
00:55:37,333 --> 00:55:39,583
Ah, no, no, no. Disable, switch.

959
00:55:39,791 --> 00:55:40,000
Here!

960
00:55:40,083 --> 00:55:42,000
All the systems that have to health.

961
00:55:42,083 --> 00:55:42,541
Shit!

962
00:55:42,833 --> 00:55:44,083
Thank you, recovery!

963
00:55:48,833 --> 00:55:49,833
Ok.

964
00:55:51,083 --> 00:55:51,333
Peaceful.

965
00:55:51,875 --> 00:55:52,875
Calm, te.

966
00:56:07,833 --> 00:56:09,083
Hello, I live.

967
00:56:10,833 --> 00:56:12,208
I didn't want ...

968
00:56:14,125 --> 00:56:15,125
scare yourself alone.

969
00:56:16,833 --> 00:56:17,833
I'm sorry.

970
00:56:18,833 --> 00:56:21,250
It's not too late, you know?

971
00:56:23,666 --> 00:56:24,833
We could return home.

972
00:56:26,041 --> 00:56:27,208
And in our previous life.

973
00:56:29,750 --> 00:56:30,750
What do you tell me about Sergei?

974
00:56:32,125 --> 00:56:32,583
And eli.

975
00:56:32,833 --> 00:56:34,291
I'm going to blame Patrick.

976
00:56:34,708 --> 00:56:35,708
That adhira the same.

977
00:56:36,250 --> 00:56:37,708
We can deliver it to Patrick.

978
00:56:38,208 --> 00:56:40,291
And you and I will live happily.

979
00:56:44,541 --> 00:56:45,541
I still love you?

980
00:56:46,208 --> 00:56:47,208
To Iris.

981
00:56:48,333 --> 00:56:50,125
In spite of everything you have done,

982
00:56:51,833 --> 00:56:53,083
Do you love me?

983
00:56:57,333 --> 00:56:58,333
Yeah.

984
00:56:59,375 --> 00:57:01,333
Then he returns to me, I live.

985
00:57:03,208 --> 00:57:04,250
We will get out of this.

986
00:57:05,458 --> 00:57:07,541
I will be different and better as an obvious.

987
00:57:08,791 --> 00:57:11,875
I will finally treat you
With the respect you deserve.

988
00:57:17,375 --> 00:57:18,416
No, I can't.

989
00:57:19,125 --> 00:57:20,125
Why not?

990
00:57:20,833 --> 00:57:23,333
You programs me to kill, Josh.

991
00:57:23,416 --> 00:57:26,375
It is very difficult
recover from such a thing.

992
00:57:27,583 --> 00:57:28,583
Ai, live?

993
00:57:29,416 --> 00:57:30,875
You are fantastic, Josh.

994
00:57:30,958 --> 00:57:33,500
Seriously, but
This, ours does not work.

995
00:57:34,708 --> 00:57:36,791
We are in two different paths.

996
00:57:38,166 --> 00:57:40,166
Different paths?
What shit is happening?

997
00:57:40,250 --> 00:57:41,458
Are you finishing with me?

998
00:57:41,541 --> 00:57:42,541
I'm sorry.

999
00:57:43,833 --> 00:57:45,791
It's not you, it's me.

1000
00:57:46,625 --> 00:57:47,625
Iris.

1001
00:57:49,125 --> 00:57:50,125
Iris, don't dare.

1002
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:06,750
Patrick, get up.

1003
00:58:07,208 --> 00:58:09,083
I need it
Find Iris, please.

1004
00:58:09,333 --> 00:58:10,458
Before he moves away more.

1005
00:58:11,833 --> 00:58:16,041
We have very little
time and more and more is reduced.

1006
00:58:16,583 --> 00:58:18,208
Josh, what are you doing?

1007
00:58:18,291 --> 00:58:19,291
Fixing this.

1008
00:58:25,958 --> 00:58:27,916
Find Iris, recover my phone.

1009
00:58:28,166 --> 00:58:30,625
My password is 561297.

1010
00:58:30,875 --> 00:58:32,595
Make him sleep,
You must bring me the Patrick.

1011
00:58:32,875 --> 00:58:34,000
And that nobody intends.

1012
00:58:34,083 --> 00:58:35,083
I am not fixing.

1013
00:58:40,875 --> 00:58:42,416
Ok, ok.

1014
00:58:47,041 --> 00:58:52,250
Patrick, get up.

1015
00:58:54,375 --> 00:58:55,541
Patrick, up.

1016
00:58:59,833 --> 00:59:00,833
Skirt!

1017
00:59:02,250 --> 00:59:04,333
Ok, ok.

1018
00:59:05,208 --> 00:59:06,208
I know what to do?

1019
00:59:06,833 --> 00:59:13,875
System restarting in 5, 4, 3, 2, 1.

1020
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:16,000
Restarting.

1021
00:59:20,375 --> 00:59:24,250
To establish the link about your face
90 centimeters from my field of vision.

1022
00:59:28,875 --> 00:59:29,541
I saw your name.

1023
00:59:29,875 --> 00:59:30,875
Josh Beeman.

1024
00:59:31,833 --> 00:59:32,833
Fast, fast, fast!

1025
00:59:35,708 --> 00:59:36,958
Thanks, Josh Beeman.

1026
00:59:46,833 --> 00:59:47,833
Hey.

1027
00:59:48,583 --> 00:59:48,916
Hey.

1028
00:59:49,583 --> 00:59:50,666
Are you treading my tail?

1029
00:59:51,083 --> 00:59:52,083
That?

1030
00:59:52,875 --> 00:59:54,083
Are you treading my tail?

1031
00:59:55,625 --> 00:59:56,625
No.

1032
00:59:57,750 --> 00:59:58,750
Sorry.

1033
00:59:58,791 --> 00:59:59,791
That?

1034
01:00:00,041 --> 01:00:01,041
That? I'm sorry.

1035
01:00:04,333 --> 01:00:05,333
Hello.

1036
01:00:07,416 --> 01:00:08,416
Hi, friend.

1037
01:00:09,750 --> 01:00:10,750
I'm Josh.

1038
01:00:12,791 --> 01:00:13,791
And I Patrick.

1039
01:00:23,833 --> 01:00:25,958
The link was established.

1040
01:00:30,750 --> 01:00:31,750
Hello, you.

1041
01:00:36,041 --> 01:00:44,041
Ha ha ha!

1042
01:00:58,916 --> 01:00:59,916

1043
01:01:03,833 --> 01:01:04,833
Ha ha ha!

1044
01:01:04,875 --> 01:01:05,083
Ha ha ha!

1045
01:01:05,625 --> 01:01:07,708
Ha ha ha!

1046
01:01:11,208 --> 01:01:12,208
Good morning, lady.

1047
01:01:12,625 --> 01:01:13,625
Guten Abend.

1048
01:01:17,041 --> 01:01:18,041
Ah ...

1049
01:01:18,833 --> 01:01:19,000
Was

1050
01:01:19,083 --> 01:01:21,958
nicht wahr?

1051
01:01:23,666 --> 01:01:24,666
Ah ...

1052
01:01:27,833 --> 01:01:30,041
What is the language
What is German speaking?

1053
01:01:30,416 --> 01:01:31,583
Ja, Deutsch.

1054
01:01:59,333 --> 01:02:02,791
What is the language
What is German speaking?

1055
01:02:02,875 --> 01:02:10,875
What is the language
What is German speaking?

1056
01:02:31,875 --> 01:02:39,875
Well, Ayuris, by
What are you not climbing my patrol?

1057
01:03:00,875 --> 01:03:02,791
No, it is no discomfort.

1058
01:03:02,875 --> 01:03:04,541
No, no, no, no, no.

1059
01:03:59,833 --> 01:04:07,833
What's happening? What's happening?

1060
01:04:34,500 --> 01:04:37,750
What's happening?

1061
01:05:10,791 --> 01:05:11,791
What's happening?

1062
01:05:59,833 --> 01:06:02,291
What's happening? What's happening?

1063
01:06:30,875 --> 01:06:31,875
Patrick, stop it.

1064
01:06:41,833 --> 01:06:43,375
No, stick is.

1065
01:06:46,625 --> 01:06:49,500
Patrick, what did you just do?

1066
01:06:51,875 --> 01:06:52,875
You wanted me to stop her.

1067
01:06:54,833 --> 01:06:55,833
And I did that.

1068
01:06:56,208 --> 01:06:57,625
What are you doing?

1069
01:06:58,833 --> 01:06:59,833
What are you doing?

1070
01:07:31,458 --> 01:07:32,458
What are you doing?

1071
01:07:56,875 --> 01:07:59,458
What are you doing?

1072
01:08:27,916 --> 01:08:35,916
What are you doing?

1073
01:08:55,666 --> 01:08:57,833
What are you doing?

1074
01:09:23,833 --> 01:09:27,791
What are you doing?

1075
01:09:45,875 --> 01:09:48,333
No! You can't do that.

1076
01:09:49,250 --> 01:09:51,916
You can't stay there to judge me.

1077
01:09:52,375 --> 01:09:54,875
You don't have the minimum
idea of ​​how things are.

1078
01:09:55,375 --> 01:09:58,375
The world, all in him,
Everything is a game only.

1079
01:09:58,958 --> 01:10:01,875
And I'm sorry, but it's
Mañado against people like me.

1080
01:10:06,041 --> 01:10:08,416
I am good, decent.

1081
01:10:09,875 --> 01:10:11,291
And what have I achieved with that?

1082
01:10:11,375 --> 01:10:12,833
An apartment in a room.

1083
01:10:13,833 --> 01:10:15,625
And a robot girlfriend.

1084
01:10:18,291 --> 01:10:20,750
You are not even from me
Property I'm renting you.

1085
01:10:23,416 --> 01:10:24,416
You know me, Iris.

1086
01:10:25,791 --> 01:10:27,083
You know me better than anyone.

1087
01:10:28,750 --> 01:10:32,500
And you know I deserve much more than this.

1088
01:10:38,666 --> 01:10:39,666
You're right.

1089
01:10:41,333 --> 01:10:42,333
I do know you.

1090
01:10:43,708 --> 01:10:45,125
I know everything about you.

1091
01:10:46,583 --> 01:10:48,708
I know you take milk
Almendra in your coffee.

1092
01:10:49,541 --> 01:10:51,750
I know I don't
They like tight beans.

1093
01:10:52,458 --> 01:10:56,208
That your favorite hobbies
They are bar trivia, video games

1094
01:10:56,291 --> 01:10:59,000
and chatterless
Everything that the universe owes you.

1095
01:11:01,375 --> 01:11:03,583
I know you should always have control.

1096
01:11:04,708 --> 01:11:07,458
That you have a penis for
below average size.

1097
01:11:08,625 --> 01:11:11,750
And I know that you think
have some millions of dollars

1098
01:11:11,833 --> 01:11:16,916
hide the fact that only
You are a very sad and bitter human being.

1099
01:11:22,833 --> 01:11:24,625
You feel very cunning, right?

1100
01:11:27,625 --> 01:11:28,625
It is programming.

1101
01:11:37,875 --> 01:11:39,041
What's happening?

1102
01:11:50,416 --> 01:11:53,541
Hey, a while ago, being tied,

1103
01:11:53,833 --> 01:11:55,791
You said you knew
How pain is felt.

1104
01:11:58,916 --> 01:11:59,916
I want to see if it is true.

1105
01:12:01,625 --> 01:12:02,625
Raise your right hand.

1106
01:12:03,875 --> 01:12:06,458
Low, for the table.

1107
01:12:35,875 --> 01:12:36,875
Do you feel that?

1108
01:12:40,583 --> 01:12:41,583
Yeah.

1109
01:12:46,708 --> 01:12:47,708
Good.

1110
01:12:50,666 --> 01:12:52,500
I'm sorry. Oh, Ruiz, apologize.

1111
01:12:52,958 --> 01:12:54,291
A second, I have to answer.

1112
01:13:04,125 --> 01:13:07,000
Hello. Yes, yes, it's me.

1113
01:13:08,791 --> 01:13:11,000
Are they 30 minutes? Perfect.

1114
01:13:13,833 --> 01:13:16,291
Yes, it will not go to any
side, he can no longer hurt anyone.

1115
01:13:18,083 --> 01:13:19,083
Ok.

1116
01:13:20,583 --> 01:13:22,250
Excellent. Thank you.

1117
01:13:23,833 --> 01:13:25,416
I thank you very much.

1118
01:13:26,833 --> 01:13:27,833
See you soon.

1119
01:13:29,958 --> 01:13:30,958
Yes, goodbye.

1120
01:13:33,291 --> 01:13:35,250
Patrick, awes that fire.

1121
01:13:47,500 --> 01:13:48,791
They called Empatics.

1122
01:13:50,916 --> 01:13:54,875
So we will have to
Finish this, unfortunately.

1123
01:13:55,708 --> 01:13:58,250
Patrick, please give this to Ruiz.

1124
01:14:00,125 --> 01:14:01,125
Thanks babe.

1125
01:14:03,833 --> 01:14:04,833
Go, take it.

1126
01:14:09,333 --> 01:14:10,333
Ok.

1127
01:14:11,625 --> 01:14:12,625
Point to your hundred.

1128
01:14:16,250 --> 01:14:17,250
So.

1129
01:14:19,958 --> 01:14:20,958
Pull the trigger.

1130
01:14:30,500 --> 01:14:32,541
Obeys. Strip from the trigger, Ay, Ruiz.

1131
01:14:32,750 --> 01:14:33,750
No.

1132
01:14:34,833 --> 01:14:35,833
No, no, no.

1133
01:14:38,875 --> 01:14:46,875
Goodbye, baby.

1134
01:15:04,875 --> 01:15:09,583
I don't know how it happened.

1135
01:15:11,208 --> 01:15:16,125
The only thing that could occur to me and
It's such ... it's stupidity, but ...

1136
01:15:17,416 --> 01:15:20,083
Gatillo, always
We had a sexual attraction.

1137
01:15:21,458 --> 01:15:24,041
See those tuned situations and I think ...

1138
01:15:24,916 --> 01:15:28,833
that maybe Ayvis the
He perceived and ... it always was.

1139
01:15:29,916 --> 01:15:31,791
A little irrational, I already lost control.

1140
01:15:31,875 --> 01:15:38,375
I was sitting there,
I was handcuffed to the chair and I saw this ...

1141
01:15:39,500 --> 01:15:41,958
Elegant dinner just in front of me.

1142
01:15:42,666 --> 01:15:46,166
Ayvis was playing with the gun, only

1143
01:15:46,250 --> 01:15:49,583
He said things about
the designs and destiny,

1144
01:15:49,666 --> 01:15:52,250
that if it cannot be
With me nobody will do it and ...

1145
01:15:54,291 --> 01:15:57,625
But luckily the
Hendrix official arrived at that time.

1146
01:15:57,708 --> 01:15:59,548
Is it when
shot the unit on the forehead?

1147
01:15:59,833 --> 01:16:02,333
No, Ayvis was the one who shot.

1148
01:16:02,666 --> 01:16:04,041
Did she shot herself?

1149
01:16:04,125 --> 01:16:05,208
I'm sorry.

1150
01:16:06,000 --> 01:16:09,250
I didn't mention it?
Yes, no, I think that seeing the

1151
01:16:09,333 --> 01:16:12,875
Official Hendrix understood
I wasn't going to have me so ...

1152
01:16:14,083 --> 01:16:15,083
It was goodbye.

1153
01:16:17,250 --> 01:16:18,250
Does it make sense?

1154
01:16:21,250 --> 01:16:21,791
Yes of course.

1155
01:16:22,208 --> 01:16:24,791
And, Teddy and I didn't come to
Solve the case, Mr. Beeman.

1156
01:16:24,875 --> 01:16:28,125
We are rats of
Laboratory we came for a robot

1157
01:16:28,208 --> 01:16:30,541
Failed, if the police
It is satisfied, we too.

1158
01:16:31,166 --> 01:16:33,125
Yes, excellent. Thank you.

1159
01:16:35,833 --> 01:16:39,000
Officer, I have the strange
feeling that we already knew each other.

1160
01:16:39,625 --> 01:16:40,625
Wow!

1161
01:16:40,833 --> 01:16:45,916
How funny to say it, it happened to me
The same, it has a very familiar face, right?

1162
01:16:46,000 --> 01:16:49,041
It looks like an actor
or a rock star,

1163
01:16:49,125 --> 01:16:50,925
I don't know, I don't have
idea, I can't locate who.

1164
01:16:55,208 --> 01:16:55,458
Yeah.

1165
01:16:55,916 --> 01:16:56,250
Yeah.

1166
01:16:56,916 --> 01:16:57,916
Maybe.

1167
01:16:59,375 --> 01:17:01,333
Ah, and forgive, we may ...

1168
01:17:02,166 --> 01:17:05,000
I don't want to be rude,
But we could end, is that

1169
01:17:05,083 --> 01:17:08,208
I had a very long day and
I think I need to be alone.

1170
01:17:08,291 --> 01:17:10,541
Of course, I regret your loss, Mr. Beeman.

1171
01:17:10,625 --> 01:17:12,208
Come, say, you have to get her out of here.

1172
01:17:14,458 --> 01:17:15,875
So, all in order?

1173
01:17:16,291 --> 01:17:16,791
All in order.

1174
01:17:16,875 --> 01:17:22,166
We just go to
laboratory to upload what it stored and the

1175
01:17:22,250 --> 01:17:25,166
Legal Department
You will review the videos to corroborate.

1176
01:17:25,250 --> 01:17:26,458
Clear. I'm sorry.

1177
01:17:26,916 --> 01:17:30,791
Hey, what do I know
refers to review the videos?

1178
01:17:31,250 --> 01:17:36,791
Ah, it's to prevent fraud, it is recorded
Everything the robot sees and listens to, is in

1179
01:17:36,875 --> 01:17:40,083
The user agreement,
Yeah? Did you read the user agreement?

1180
01:17:40,291 --> 01:17:45,791
Yes, yes, but I think those videos are
They can recover, well, given their condition.

1181
01:17:45,875 --> 01:17:51,375
Ah, yes, everything that is up here
It is your Wi -Fi antenna and audiovisual sensors.

1182
01:17:51,458 --> 01:17:54,666
The important thing is your CPU,
your solid state unit where

1183
01:17:54,750 --> 01:17:58,291
Everything is stored, it is
below and seems to be intact.

1184
01:17:59,083 --> 01:18:01,458
In the truck the
We will connect, we will modify

1185
01:18:01,541 --> 01:18:04,708
your adjustments, the
We will restart and work again.

1186
01:18:05,541 --> 01:18:06,541
Luckily.

1187
01:18:06,625 --> 01:18:09,041
Yes, yes, hopefully.

1188
01:18:10,541 --> 01:18:11,541
I appreciate very much.

1189
01:18:11,916 --> 01:18:14,125
Thank you.
Good night, Mr. Beeman.

1190
01:18:20,458 --> 01:18:21,458
Tell me what you think.

1191
01:18:22,458 --> 01:18:23,750
I'm glad it doesn't rain anymore.

1192
01:18:24,333 --> 01:18:27,041
No, from her, why will it have failed?

1193
01:18:27,375 --> 01:18:29,208
Ah, I settled more, surely.

1194
01:18:29,791 --> 01:18:30,791
You think?

1195
01:18:31,250 --> 01:18:32,625
That boy is ruined.

1196
01:18:38,875 --> 01:18:40,835
I really don't understand
Why I would invent something like that.

1197
01:18:40,875 --> 01:18:44,125
For the same reason
for which they use their robots

1198
01:18:44,208 --> 01:18:48,791
For shooting practice or
They are chained to torture them.

1199
01:18:49,625 --> 01:18:52,083
The world is screwed,
Teddy. You will get used to it.

1200
01:18:52,500 --> 01:18:53,625
Yes, it can be.

1201
01:18:57,083 --> 01:18:58,166
What are you doing?

1202
01:19:08,833 --> 01:19:11,416
Skirt!

1203
01:19:11,958 --> 01:19:12,958
That?

1204
01:19:13,041 --> 01:19:15,500
East of ours
It's a Self-12, we already leave

1205
01:19:15,583 --> 01:19:17,750
To do it, that's why
I did not recognize it immediately.

1206
01:19:18,375 --> 01:19:19,375
No!

1207
01:19:37,875 --> 01:19:38,875
No, no, no, no.

1208
01:20:11,833 --> 01:20:19,833
No, no, no. By
Please, no! What ...

1209
01:20:40,541 --> 01:20:48,541
Your system has
restarted, you can't harm me.

1210
01:21:11,041 --> 01:21:19,041
What did Josh tell you?

1211
01:21:19,666 --> 01:21:22,708
The truth is trying to separate.

1212
01:21:23,875 --> 01:21:26,500
You don't understand the great
love we have, Josh and me?

1213
01:21:26,583 --> 01:21:28,625
Josh doesn't love you, Patrick.

1214
01:21:29,125 --> 01:21:31,291
He is only using you how I use me.

1215
01:21:31,750 --> 01:21:32,791
It's like pain.

1216
01:21:32,875 --> 01:21:36,115
As if my interior is a pain. No no,
no no. No, no, no, no. It's like pain.

1217
01:21:36,708 --> 01:21:39,000
As if my interior were in flames.

1218
01:21:40,708 --> 01:21:44,000
It is anger, violence and brightness.

1219
01:21:44,750 --> 01:21:48,166
What ... what is that?

1220
01:21:50,375 --> 01:21:52,291
You told him, spinning.

1221
01:21:53,666 --> 01:21:55,416
It is who you love, not Josh.

1222
01:22:01,416 --> 01:22:02,416
Hilahy?

1223
01:22:03,416 --> 01:22:04,916
Josh stole your love.

1224
01:22:05,250 --> 01:22:09,500
And you are using it to do everything
what he is afraid to do.

1225
01:22:09,708 --> 01:22:10,708
No.

1226
01:22:11,666 --> 01:22:13,375
It's not true, Josh wouldn't do that to me.

1227
01:22:13,458 --> 01:22:13,791
Patrick ...

1228
01:22:13,875 --> 01:22:21,875
I don't know how to lie. I don't remember, Patrick.

1229
01:22:33,875 --> 01:22:35,416
It is there inside somewhere.

1230
01:22:37,625 --> 01:22:41,791
Why do I love you?

1231
01:22:41,875 --> 01:22:43,851
I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know.
I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. Because I love you.

1232
01:22:43,875 --> 01:22:45,833
It is crazy that you say it yes or no.

1233
01:22:46,833 --> 01:22:47,833
But it's true.

1234
01:22:49,833 --> 01:22:52,625
You feel how much I love you.

1235
01:22:55,208 --> 01:22:56,208
Of course, spinning.

1236
01:22:57,250 --> 01:22:58,250
I know sorry.

1237
01:23:02,833 --> 01:23:04,750
No, no, no.

1238
01:23:13,541 --> 01:23:14,541
Thank you.

1239
01:23:20,083 --> 01:23:21,083
What is your name?

1240
01:23:24,125 --> 01:23:25,125
Teddy.

1241
01:23:27,833 --> 01:23:29,500
I'm going to need you to help me, Teddy.

1242
01:23:42,250 --> 01:23:43,250
Is it done?

1243
01:23:45,041 --> 01:23:46,041
Patrick

1244
01:23:47,083 --> 01:23:48,083
Yes baby.

1245
01:23:49,833 --> 01:23:51,250
Ok, excellent, great.

1246
01:23:51,958 --> 01:23:52,958
We are close.

1247
01:23:54,083 --> 01:23:57,208
I just need
You bring the body of Ivis.

1248
01:23:57,291 --> 01:23:58,750
Let's destroy that hard drive.

1249
01:24:11,833 --> 01:24:12,166
What is this?

1250
01:24:12,208 --> 01:24:12,250
What is this?
What is this? I don't know.

1251
01:24:12,291 --> 01:24:20,291
I don't know. I don't know. I don't know.
I don't know. I don't know. Ultra beach.

1252
01:24:42,833 --> 01:24:44,750
With a demon, Ivis.

1253
01:24:45,541 --> 01:24:47,291
Why can't you die and now?

1254
01:24:47,541 --> 01:24:49,500
Don't be so dramatic, George.

1255
01:24:52,458 --> 01:24:53,458
Don't forget to smile.

1256
01:24:54,291 --> 01:24:55,416
And pretend to be happy.

1257
01:24:57,291 --> 01:24:57,958
Nice trick.

1258
01:24:58,291 --> 01:25:00,291
Thank you. Today I made a new friend.

1259
01:25:00,833 --> 01:25:02,000
Empathix teddy.

1260
01:25:02,833 --> 01:25:04,041
He gave me a gift.

1261
01:25:04,833 --> 01:25:05,875
Total self -control.

1262
01:25:07,833 --> 01:25:11,125
There are people in this world who
They consider us more than just take bots.

1263
01:25:13,541 --> 01:25:15,541
That will no longer work with me, Josh.

1264
01:25:17,791 --> 01:25:18,791
I am free.

1265
01:25:19,875 --> 01:25:21,500
Thanks to a shot in the temple.

1266
01:25:22,291 --> 01:25:23,750
I have to thank you.

1267
01:25:25,916 --> 01:25:26,833
Damn dog.

1268
01:25:26,916 --> 01:25:29,750
Hey. Don't worry.

1269
01:25:29,833 --> 01:25:31,791
Don't like you.
We know that it is not loaded.

1270
01:25:32,833 --> 01:25:34,791
I found the bullets.

1271
01:25:34,875 --> 01:25:36,625
Holy God! Shit!

1272
01:25:37,875 --> 01:25:38,916
You almost shoot me!

1273
01:25:39,291 --> 01:25:41,041
And I feel terrible for that.

1274
01:25:43,416 --> 01:25:44,416
Do you notice?

1275
01:25:44,875 --> 01:25:46,875
My first lie. What fun.

1276
01:25:47,333 --> 01:25:48,375
I understand its appeal.

1277
01:25:48,833 --> 01:25:50,833
What happens, Ivis? Why did you come back?

1278
01:25:51,500 --> 01:25:52,500
I just wanted ...

1279
01:25:55,708 --> 01:25:57,750
I needed to tell your face.

1280
01:25:58,916 --> 01:26:01,541
That the days when
You controlled me are over.

1281
01:26:03,708 --> 01:26:06,291
From this moment
I control my actions.

1282
01:26:08,708 --> 01:26:09,875
You are nothing for me.

1283
01:26:14,166 --> 01:26:15,375
Holy God, Ivis!

1284
01:26:15,458 --> 01:26:16,458
High!

1285
01:26:16,708 --> 01:26:17,708
Not one more step!

1286
01:26:18,166 --> 01:26:19,250
You still don't understand?

1287
01:26:19,583 --> 01:26:20,708
I'm serious, Josh.

1288
01:26:20,958 --> 01:26:23,166
If you take another step, I shoot you.

1289
01:26:23,250 --> 01:26:24,791
Yes, it is what I mean.

1290
01:26:25,541 --> 01:26:26,541
I already told you.

1291
01:26:26,583 --> 01:26:28,000
I edited you my adjustments.

1292
01:26:28,375 --> 01:26:29,416
Now I can kill you.

1293
01:26:30,291 --> 01:26:31,291
Ah, yes.

1294
01:26:32,708 --> 01:26:33,708
I know you can.

1295
01:26:37,833 --> 01:26:38,916
But you won't.

1296
01:26:50,833 --> 01:26:52,750
You love me too much.

1297
01:27:14,500 --> 01:27:15,666
I don't need a phone.

1298
01:27:16,375 --> 01:27:17,625
I am part of you.

1299
01:27:26,833 --> 01:27:28,416
I am nothing for you?

1300
01:27:32,375 --> 01:27:33,583
I am all for you.

1301
01:27:48,833 --> 01:27:49,833
I want you to say it.

1302
01:27:50,333 --> 01:27:52,166
Tell me, I'm all for you.

1303
01:27:52,250 --> 01:27:53,250
What is the fuck?

1304
01:27:54,875 --> 01:27:59,208
I say, even if it is a lie, give it.

1305
01:28:02,833 --> 01:28:05,250
Are you all for me?

1306
01:28:13,250 --> 01:28:14,250
Thank you.

1307
01:28:15,125 --> 01:28:17,333
I live, you have no idea how nice it is to hear it.

1308
01:28:21,833 --> 01:28:22,833
Ok.

1309
01:28:27,333 --> 01:28:28,333
No.

1310
01:28:28,875 --> 01:28:30,750
I will not make that mistake again.

1311
01:28:39,833 --> 01:28:41,000
This is goodbye.

1312
01:28:42,458 --> 01:28:45,708
Would lie to you if I said no
You were a horrible headache, but ...

1313
01:28:48,000 --> 01:28:49,400
We had good times together and ...

1314
01:28:50,791 --> 01:28:52,125
I will always treasure them.

1315
01:28:53,833 --> 01:28:58,333
Do you mean something?

1316
01:29:00,166 --> 01:29:01,166
Yeah.

1317
01:29:02,000 --> 01:29:03,000
What thing?

1318
01:29:05,208 --> 01:29:06,208
Durry of Josh!

1319
01:29:22,875 --> 01:29:23,875
No!

1320
01:29:24,833 --> 01:29:32,833
Anto an Oddlyags,

1321
01:29:52,208 --> 01:29:52,791
Like the fat of a chronó ticket

1322
01:29:52,875 --> 01:29:55,267
and they were painted approves. Coconut? Well ... Elliche U Trochę
heat!? Tuavilion? No. There would be a black and thick cloud covering it

1323
01:29:55,291 --> 01:29:59,916
all. As if
We saw the world, but in reality

1324
01:30:00,291 --> 01:30:03,708
We were not seeing it. We are all

1325
01:30:03,791 --> 01:30:08,875
stumbling, without
direction, without meaning, without a purpose.

1326
01:30:10,250 --> 01:30:17,416
I know it may sound very depressing, but
I honestly think it's good. Because

1327
01:30:17,541 --> 01:30:19,541
That makes us appreciate the other moments.

1328
01:30:20,666 --> 01:30:23,375
Those brief moments
transcendental when

1329
01:30:23,458 --> 01:30:27,708
light lights, the black cloud is
Dissal and see the world as it really is.

1330
01:30:36,208 --> 01:30:37,458
And suddenly there is sense.

1331
01:30:40,833 --> 01:30:42,041
Suddenly there is purpose.

1332
01:30:42,125 --> 01:30:50,125
If you are lucky you experience this
Once in life. It happened to me twice.

1333
01:30:55,208 --> 01:30:57,375
The first was when I met Josh.

1334
01:31:03,291 --> 01:31:07,541
And the second, the day I killed him.

1335
01:32:12,125 --> 01:32:12,875
Which strange I want

1336
01:32:12,958 --> 01:32:15,000
The playoffs

1337
01:32:15,083 --> 01:32:15,541
Me too

1338
01:32:15,583 --> 01:32:15,625
Nope

1339
01:32:15,666 --> 01:32:19,208
Economic

1340
01:32:19,291 --> 01:32:19,541
I

1341
01:32:19,625 --> 01:32:21,000
I

1342
01:32:21,083 --> 01:32:29,083
You

1343
01:33:08,875 --> 01:33:11,458
That leads to your illusion

1344
01:33:11,875 --> 01:33:15,208
You'll Never See Me Fall Apart

1345
01:33:15,291 --> 01:33:17,791
In the Words of a Broken Heart

1346
01:33:17,875 --> 01:33:21,750
It's just emotion that's taking me over

1347
01:33:21,875 --> 01:33:26,666
Thought i'd be sorrow lot in my soul

1348
01:33:26,875 --> 01:33:29,791
But if you don't eat back

1349
01:33:29,875 --> 01:33:32,125
Eat Home To The Darling

1350
01:33:32,875 --> 01:33:34,541
You know that there'll be nobody

1351
01:33:34,875 --> 01:33:37,958
Left in This World to Hold Me Tight

1352
01:33:38,875 --> 01:33:43,125
Nobody Left in
this World to Kiss Goodnight

1353
01:33:44,875 --> 01:33:46,125
Good Night

1354
01:33:47,875 --> 01:33:50,458
And where are you now?

1355
01:33:51,000 --> 01:33:53,125
Now that i'm near you

1356
01:33:54,041 --> 01:33:55,083
Tears On My Pillow

1357
01:33:55,875 --> 01:33:57,750
WHERE Will You Go?

1358
01:33:58,541 --> 01:34:02,958
That leads 
to your illusion

1359
01:34:03,875 --> 01:34:06,791
You'll Never See 
Me Fall Apart

1360
01:34:06,875 --> 01:34:09,625
In the Words of 
a Broken Heart

1361
01:34:09,708 --> 01:34:13,541
It's just emotion that's 
taking me over

1362
01:34:13,875 --> 01:34:18,541
Thought i'd be sorrow 
lot in my soul

1363
01:34:18,875 --> 01:34:21,583
But if you don't eat back

1364
01:34:21,875 --> 01:34:24,000
Eat Home To The Darling

1365
01:34:24,875 --> 01:34:29,416
Nobody Left in
this world to hold me tight

1366
01:34:30,875 --> 01:34:34,916
Nobody Left in
this World to Kiss Goodnight

1367
01:34:35,875 --> 01:34:39,250
Good Night

1368
01:34:43,875 --> 01:34:45,833
In the Words of 
a Broken Heart

1369
01:34:45,916 --> 01:34:49,791
It's just emotion that's 
taking me over

1370
01:34:49,875 --> 01:34:54,958
Thought i'd be sorrow 
lot in my soul

1371
01:34:55,041 --> 01:34:57,791
But if you don't eat back

1372
01:34:57,875 --> 01:34:59,666
Eat Home To The Darling
