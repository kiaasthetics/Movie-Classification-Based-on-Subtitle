1
00:01:30,675 --> 00:01:33,550
Miss, we'll be landing soon.

2
00:01:33,551 --> 00:01:35,596
Would you like a glass
of the same wine?

3
00:01:36,971 --> 00:01:38,850
No, that's okay.

4
00:01:39,433 --> 00:01:41,265
By the way,

5
00:01:41,266 --> 00:01:42,810
I'm Korean.

6
00:01:42,811 --> 00:01:45,187
Is that so? My apologies.

7
00:01:45,188 --> 00:01:46,606
Have a comfortable flight.

8
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:07,586
The chairman's main
business is real estate.

9
00:02:08,086 --> 00:02:13,382
He owns a ton of land in Korea
and has investments here too.

10
00:02:13,383 --> 00:02:17,387
You know, he's one of those
people born into money.

11
00:02:17,388 --> 00:02:20,056
The filthy rich ones.

12
00:02:23,351 --> 00:02:25,061
How am I supposed to trust them?

13
00:02:25,561 --> 00:02:27,606
You should have
considered my opinion too.

14
00:02:28,983 --> 00:02:31,484
These are totally
different circumstances.

15
00:02:31,485 --> 00:02:32,403
I don't get it.

16
00:02:32,404 --> 00:02:33,863
Just do whatever you want.

17
00:02:46,833 --> 00:02:50,459
We've calmed him
down with sedatives,

18
00:02:50,460 --> 00:02:53,882
but he hasn't stopped
crying since birth.

19
00:02:53,883 --> 00:02:57,844
All top doctors here
have examined him,

20
00:02:57,845 --> 00:03:01,180
but he's medically sound.

21
00:03:01,181 --> 00:03:03,641
So we've heard.

22
00:03:10,106 --> 00:03:13,482
My apologies, but could we
have the room to ourselves?

23
00:03:13,483 --> 00:03:14,705
Pardon?

24
00:03:54,735 --> 00:03:57,235
There must be others with the
same condition in your family.

25
00:03:57,236 --> 00:03:58,571
His father...

26
00:03:59,906 --> 00:04:00,906
and his grandfather.

27
00:04:09,125 --> 00:04:11,374
Is she talking about
Ji-yong and his father?

28
00:04:11,375 --> 00:04:13,210
Those expressions...

29
00:04:13,211 --> 00:04:14,130
Yes.

30
00:04:14,131 --> 00:04:15,840
Changing from suspicion

31
00:04:16,756 --> 00:04:18,091
to shock.

32
00:04:22,053 --> 00:04:26,350
They live in the light and
look towards bright spaces.

33
00:04:29,353 --> 00:04:32,940
Bright lights are needed
in the world for us to see.

34
00:04:34,066 --> 00:04:38,443
And people only believe in
things they can see and touch.

35
00:04:42,115 --> 00:04:43,741
A world with bright lights.

36
00:04:46,203 --> 00:04:48,288
And the back side of it.

37
00:04:55,086 --> 00:04:59,050
People have known of the beings
living in the darkness for a long time

38
00:05:00,133 --> 00:05:01,760
and have called
them by many names.

39
00:05:02,761 --> 00:05:06,390
Ghosts, devils,
goblins, ghouls...

40
00:05:07,015 --> 00:05:10,936
These beings constantly
envy and long for the light,

41
00:05:11,811 --> 00:05:12,896
and just occasionally

42
00:05:13,771 --> 00:05:15,605
would cross the line.

43
00:05:18,943 --> 00:05:21,611
That's when people ask for me.

44
00:05:25,826 --> 00:05:26,826
Yin and Yang.

45
00:05:27,578 --> 00:05:29,163
Science and superstition.

46
00:05:30,288 --> 00:05:31,956
I exist between them.

47
00:05:33,291 --> 00:05:36,127
I am Shaman Lee Hwa-rim.

48
00:05:36,128 --> 00:05:38,005
My wife told me you'd be coming.

49
00:05:38,628 --> 00:05:39,798
I'm Park Ji-yong.

50
00:05:50,766 --> 00:05:54,438
My brother committed
suicide in the mental ward.

51
00:05:55,478 --> 00:05:56,646
Then it began with me,

52
00:05:57,566 --> 00:05:58,566
and now...

53
00:06:00,276 --> 00:06:02,361
my newborn son.

54
00:06:03,613 --> 00:06:07,366
When I close my eyes,
I hear screaming.

55
00:06:08,243 --> 00:06:09,995
And a sensation of being choked.

56
00:06:10,955 --> 00:06:14,125
Firstborns and tainted blood...

57
00:06:15,458 --> 00:06:17,877
Normally, genetics
are initially blamed,

58
00:06:17,878 --> 00:06:20,918
then the land their house is built on,
and finally, they move to a new place.

59
00:06:21,421 --> 00:06:22,421
Shadow...

60
00:06:23,258 --> 00:06:26,260
I saw a shadow here
as soon as I arrived.

61
00:06:26,261 --> 00:06:28,471
It's pressing down
on its descendants.

62
00:06:29,805 --> 00:06:33,393
It's likely the shadow
of your grandfather.

63
00:06:34,018 --> 00:06:35,019
My grandfather?

64
00:06:35,020 --> 00:06:39,316
We refer to it as
the Grave's Calling.

65
00:06:40,690 --> 00:06:45,155
Simply put, it's one of your ancestors
throwing a tantrum in their grave.

66
00:06:46,365 --> 00:06:47,323
Are you certain?

67
00:06:47,324 --> 00:06:49,743
Yes, 100%.

68
00:06:52,203 --> 00:06:56,000
Then what do I have to do?

69
00:06:57,958 --> 00:06:59,834
You've got to spend
money and hire people.

70
00:06:59,835 --> 00:07:03,756
I can't do this on my own.
We'll have to work with experts.

71
00:07:05,216 --> 00:07:06,716
Damn it.

72
00:07:08,011 --> 00:07:10,553
Why are they the only
ones I can think of?

73
00:07:38,458 --> 00:07:41,545
- Exhumation!
- Exhumation!

74
00:07:45,005 --> 00:07:47,425
How dare you stare at
your ancestor's awakening!

75
00:07:48,260 --> 00:07:49,552
I'm sorry.

76
00:07:49,553 --> 00:07:51,511
Come on, let's go.

77
00:07:53,431 --> 00:07:55,225
- One, two, three!
- Three!

78
00:08:05,986 --> 00:08:07,445
No sign of water.

79
00:08:08,321 --> 00:08:11,656
I'm sorry for waking you up.

80
00:08:12,951 --> 00:08:14,245
It's very clean.

81
00:08:14,745 --> 00:08:17,035
Nice and fragrant.

82
00:08:17,036 --> 00:08:20,208
This coffin is stuffed.

83
00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:22,126
Man, oh man.

84
00:08:22,878 --> 00:08:28,175
I told them not to put any
metals inside for her sake.

85
00:08:30,633 --> 00:08:31,969
Chairman Kim.

86
00:08:31,970 --> 00:08:36,805
I've settled on the plots for your
mother and ancestors, haven't I?

87
00:08:36,806 --> 00:08:38,725
Yes, that's correct.

88
00:08:38,726 --> 00:08:43,730
And you're all healthy
and business is good, yes?

89
00:08:43,731 --> 00:08:45,441
Yes, thanks to you.

90
00:08:46,485 --> 00:08:48,943
No matter how I look at it,

91
00:08:49,570 --> 00:08:54,367
this is one of the finest plots
I've seen in my 40-year career.

92
00:08:54,368 --> 00:08:57,369
It's got all the five
elements right here, see?

93
00:08:57,370 --> 00:08:58,621
It really does, all right?

94
00:08:59,705 --> 00:09:02,580
I really gave you a good deal.

95
00:09:02,581 --> 00:09:03,708
Right, I'm sure.

96
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:06,670
So set aside your worry.

97
00:09:07,631 --> 00:09:09,633
Do the right thing
and re-bury her.

98
00:09:10,633 --> 00:09:13,510
It must be the right
call if you say so.

99
00:09:13,511 --> 00:09:17,014
But why does she keep showing
up in my kids' dreams?

100
00:09:17,015 --> 00:09:19,058
Even my wife said
she's been seeing her.

101
00:09:20,643 --> 00:09:21,645
Mr. Ko!

102
00:09:22,478 --> 00:09:23,977
What's taking so long?

103
00:09:23,978 --> 00:09:25,564
I'm starving.

104
00:09:25,565 --> 00:09:28,607
I'm hungry too, and so is she.

105
00:09:28,608 --> 00:09:31,445
Look, someone shrouded
her without checking.

106
00:09:31,446 --> 00:09:32,610
- Does the count look good?
- Yes.

107
00:09:32,611 --> 00:09:33,611
Good.

108
00:09:48,380 --> 00:09:50,381
Someone has the
old lady's teeth.

109
00:09:53,133 --> 00:09:55,261
Who took the old
lady's dentures?

110
00:10:07,356 --> 00:10:10,818
Did you take Grandma's teeth?

111
00:10:11,528 --> 00:10:12,569
Sang-hyun.

112
00:10:12,570 --> 00:10:15,447
The thing in your closet,
was that her teeth?

113
00:10:15,448 --> 00:10:17,450
Why would you...

114
00:10:17,951 --> 00:10:20,120
All her stuff was burned,

115
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:22,580
and now she's gone.

116
00:10:23,746 --> 00:10:25,039
Dad.

117
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:27,292
I just wanted something
that was hers...

118
00:10:27,293 --> 00:10:30,212
Kid, your grandma
says she's hungry.

119
00:10:30,213 --> 00:10:31,297
Let's return it to her.

120
00:10:31,298 --> 00:10:33,172
What about me then?

121
00:10:33,173 --> 00:10:35,551
What do I remember her by?

122
00:10:36,176 --> 00:10:38,512
There's nothing left of her.

123
00:10:38,513 --> 00:10:39,680
Sang-hyun, right?

124
00:10:40,390 --> 00:10:46,061
Sang-hyun, your grandma
will always be by your side.

125
00:10:54,695 --> 00:10:55,695
Bloodline.

126
00:10:56,990 --> 00:10:59,492
People that remain
tied even in death.

127
00:10:59,493 --> 00:11:03,538
A group that shares the same genes
and physical and mental attributes.

128
00:11:04,998 --> 00:11:08,833
When a person's body finishes its
cycle, it turns into dirt and earth.

129
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:13,922
As we drink from that dirt
and walk on that earth,

130
00:11:13,923 --> 00:11:18,967
we live, die, and are
reborn in a cyclical nature.

131
00:11:18,968 --> 00:11:24,058
In other words, the dirt and earth
connect and cycle everything.

132
00:11:24,935 --> 00:11:28,687
All the skeptics can fuck off.

133
00:11:28,688 --> 00:11:33,026
To the top 1%, feng shui
is a religion and science.

134
00:11:35,611 --> 00:11:36,905
And I'm a feng shui expert.

135
00:11:38,031 --> 00:11:41,950
I find and plot the land
for the dead and the living.

136
00:11:41,951 --> 00:11:44,954
I am Geomancer Kim Sang-duk.

137
00:11:44,955 --> 00:11:47,580
NOBLE FUNERAL HOME

138
00:11:47,581 --> 00:11:50,584
Many domestic companies see
the current economic situation

139
00:11:50,585 --> 00:11:52,211
as a prolonged downturn.

140
00:11:52,836 --> 00:11:54,379
According to the findings...

141
00:11:54,380 --> 00:11:56,756
Let it cook, will you?

142
00:11:57,968 --> 00:12:01,179
I can't wait that long.
One grill is plenty.

143
00:12:01,180 --> 00:12:03,430
Be honest, Mr. Kim.

144
00:12:03,431 --> 00:12:06,350
Was that really a
pristine plot today?

145
00:12:06,351 --> 00:12:07,518
Hey, watch what you say.

146
00:12:08,353 --> 00:12:10,312
They're my regulars.

147
00:12:10,313 --> 00:12:15,609
It looked like it was facing
the North quite awkwardly,

148
00:12:15,610 --> 00:12:19,112
and the aura of the site
felt really quite off.

149
00:12:19,113 --> 00:12:21,575
Why don't you become a
geomancer yourself, now?

150
00:12:22,075 --> 00:12:25,203
If you think you know so well,
you should go on your own.

151
00:12:25,868 --> 00:12:27,537
So I've been doing
some thinking.

152
00:12:27,538 --> 00:12:32,000
An average of 250,000 people
die every year in our country,

153
00:12:32,001 --> 00:12:33,792
and 30% of them get buried.

154
00:12:33,793 --> 00:12:37,423
Imagine how many people have
been buried in good plots

155
00:12:37,923 --> 00:12:40,882
since the Joseon era
in this tiny country.

156
00:12:40,883 --> 00:12:44,681
So how can there still be so
many pristine plots around?

157
00:12:45,390 --> 00:12:47,516
- It just doesn't make sense...
- That plot...

158
00:12:48,643 --> 00:12:50,644
was a 65 out of 100.

159
00:12:50,645 --> 00:12:52,604
Right, it wasn't a 100.

160
00:12:52,605 --> 00:12:55,189
They're drying up.
There aren't any more.

161
00:12:55,190 --> 00:13:00,487
Funeral directors like you
are hired by corporations,

162
00:13:00,488 --> 00:13:04,992
and men like me who sell plots just
poke around construction sites.

163
00:13:04,993 --> 00:13:08,662
It's all over. We're
the last ones standing.

164
00:13:08,663 --> 00:13:09,997
Have a drink.

165
00:13:09,998 --> 00:13:12,041
Hold on, they're here already.

166
00:13:12,541 --> 00:13:14,167
You came so early.

167
00:13:14,168 --> 00:13:15,502
It's been a while.

168
00:13:15,503 --> 00:13:17,670
- Good evening.
- Hey, there.

169
00:13:17,671 --> 00:13:21,509
Goodness, I could smell the pine
mushrooms all the way in Seoul.

170
00:13:21,510 --> 00:13:23,510
- I just had to bring myself.
- He ate all of them.

171
00:13:23,511 --> 00:13:24,888
What are you talking about?

172
00:13:25,555 --> 00:13:27,139
- Have you been well?
- Come on in.

173
00:13:27,140 --> 00:13:28,557
Sorry for not calling often.

174
00:13:28,558 --> 00:13:30,184
It can't be helped
if you're busy.

175
00:13:30,185 --> 00:13:32,895
By the way, Bong-gil. Your
looks have gotten better.

176
00:13:32,896 --> 00:13:33,896
You really think so?

177
00:13:33,897 --> 00:13:35,480
Don't even mention it.

178
00:13:35,481 --> 00:13:38,401
The ladies all want him
around. It's inflating his ego.

179
00:13:38,983 --> 00:13:41,529
How long has it
been? Three years?

180
00:13:41,530 --> 00:13:44,030
Yes, time really flies.

181
00:13:44,031 --> 00:13:46,990
How's business lately?

182
00:13:46,991 --> 00:13:50,162
So-so, you know.
It's off-season.

183
00:13:50,163 --> 00:13:52,747
Which is why I brought...

184
00:13:52,748 --> 00:13:54,793
Wait a minute, I...

185
00:13:55,460 --> 00:13:57,835
Mr. Ko, do you smell that?

186
00:13:57,836 --> 00:14:00,422
What smell? Perhaps this?

187
00:14:00,423 --> 00:14:02,880
That's right, I smell dough.

188
00:14:02,881 --> 00:14:04,343
Jeez.

189
00:14:05,010 --> 00:14:06,680
I tried my best to hide it.

190
00:14:08,431 --> 00:14:09,431
You got me.

191
00:14:11,768 --> 00:14:14,017
- Spill it already. What is it?
- We got you just right.

192
00:14:14,018 --> 00:14:15,646
You gentlemen clue
in so quickly.

193
00:14:22,195 --> 00:14:27,324
We visited a strange family in the US
upon a request from a doctor friend.

194
00:14:27,325 --> 00:14:29,242
The family of Mr. Park Ji-yong.

195
00:14:29,243 --> 00:14:31,829
The patriarch is
a Korean national,

196
00:14:31,830 --> 00:14:34,288
but everyone else including
Mr. Park are American citizens.

197
00:14:34,875 --> 00:14:37,626
- They're apparently...
- Filthy rich.

198
00:14:38,211 --> 00:14:39,336
That's a good start.

199
00:14:40,713 --> 00:14:44,133
All the firstborns are
haunted, including a newborn.

200
00:14:45,843 --> 00:14:47,261
They held out long enough.

201
00:14:48,388 --> 00:14:49,805
It isn't possession?

202
00:14:49,806 --> 00:14:52,100
It's not at that stage yet,

203
00:14:53,058 --> 00:14:57,105
but it's obviously
the Grave's Calling.

204
00:14:59,775 --> 00:15:03,695
Are you really going to dig
up your grandfather's grave?

205
00:15:05,905 --> 00:15:07,865
It's been almost 100 years.

206
00:15:09,158 --> 00:15:10,535
I don't need your approval.

207
00:15:11,033 --> 00:15:12,451
I've made up my mind.

208
00:15:15,373 --> 00:15:17,583
You really believe
in such things?

209
00:15:18,835 --> 00:15:22,461
And you think your aunt in
Korea will agree on this?

210
00:15:26,008 --> 00:15:27,466
I'm the head of the family,

211
00:15:28,803 --> 00:15:30,263
so I make the decisions.

212
00:15:32,598 --> 00:15:35,935
I don't trust those people.

213
00:15:36,728 --> 00:15:38,938
This could get out of hand.

214
00:15:39,521 --> 00:15:41,190
The baby will get
better in time.

215
00:15:43,358 --> 00:15:47,655
Let's pray together
and seek treatments.

216
00:15:59,751 --> 00:16:04,798
We just have to live quietly
away from everything.

217
00:16:25,068 --> 00:16:28,362
Who cares if her belly's
full during the wedding?

218
00:16:28,363 --> 00:16:30,154
It's the best gift
you could ask for.

219
00:16:30,155 --> 00:16:34,032
But even so, a grandchild? And
one with blonde hair, no less.

220
00:16:34,033 --> 00:16:36,035
The baby will have blue eyes!

221
00:16:36,705 --> 00:16:37,995
What an old fart.

222
00:16:37,996 --> 00:16:41,039
Will she be staying in
Germany after the wedding?

223
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:43,795
Of course not. She has
to come back to Korea.

224
00:16:44,461 --> 00:16:50,509
Anyway, I was worried about
the cost of her wedding.

225
00:16:50,510 --> 00:16:52,134
We caught a big
game just in time.

226
00:16:52,135 --> 00:16:53,262
Indeed.

227
00:16:53,263 --> 00:16:59,517
Our Lord sends us pension
just when the time is right.

228
00:16:59,518 --> 00:17:00,518
Amen.

229
00:17:02,355 --> 00:17:07,360
How rich do you think this man is to
pay us 500 million won to relocate?

230
00:17:08,026 --> 00:17:09,737
He probably paid more.

231
00:17:09,738 --> 00:17:11,112
What? More?

232
00:17:11,113 --> 00:17:14,742
You know how Hwa-rim can be.

233
00:17:14,743 --> 00:17:16,410
You think she didn't take a cut?

234
00:17:16,411 --> 00:17:21,330
Right, she wouldn't
hesitate to exploit us.

235
00:17:26,295 --> 00:17:30,674
May I get your grandfather's
name and hometown first?

236
00:17:30,675 --> 00:17:36,555
I normally check the family's reputation
and occupations before the job,

237
00:17:36,556 --> 00:17:38,974
but since you're in a rush...

238
00:17:38,975 --> 00:17:43,438
Shouldn't you earn the
trust of the employer first?

239
00:17:48,818 --> 00:17:49,861
Trust?

240
00:17:51,153 --> 00:17:52,404
Very well.

241
00:17:52,405 --> 00:17:55,614
We can call this off if
you're not up for it.

242
00:17:55,615 --> 00:17:57,743
Can you promise me two things?

243
00:17:58,661 --> 00:18:01,203
From here on, keep
everything confidential.

244
00:18:01,873 --> 00:18:03,916
And cremate him right away.

245
00:18:05,793 --> 00:18:06,793
With the coffin.

246
00:18:08,588 --> 00:18:10,129
With the coffin?

247
00:18:10,130 --> 00:18:11,550
Don't bother opening it?

248
00:18:12,466 --> 00:18:13,801
Does it matter?

249
00:18:14,718 --> 00:18:18,305
I was told that it'd be either
relocation or cremation anyway.

250
00:18:18,306 --> 00:18:20,264
Under normal circumstances,

251
00:18:20,265 --> 00:18:23,352
we would first notify
the town office,

252
00:18:23,353 --> 00:18:27,355
open the coffin, and have the mortician
check the status of the bones.

253
00:18:27,356 --> 00:18:30,817
And then it would be
relocated or cremated.

254
00:18:30,818 --> 00:18:31,903
Okay?

255
00:18:37,325 --> 00:18:40,494
Let's go and check
out the plot first.

256
00:18:40,495 --> 00:18:43,830
My parents and relatives
are against this adamantly.

257
00:18:43,831 --> 00:18:47,085
- I would like it to be done as swiftly...
- So let's check the plot first.

258
00:18:52,881 --> 00:18:55,217
Northern Gangwon...

259
00:18:55,218 --> 00:18:57,510
I've got a bad
feeling about this.

260
00:18:57,511 --> 00:19:01,305
I find it weird that he
doesn't want the coffin opened.

261
00:19:01,850 --> 00:19:04,393
Shouldn't the bones
be checked regardless?

262
00:19:05,020 --> 00:19:06,478
He'll skip the shrouding then?

263
00:19:09,106 --> 00:19:11,691
Could there be something
inside the coffin?

264
00:19:12,191 --> 00:19:14,693
BOGUK TEMPLE

265
00:19:41,765 --> 00:19:43,181
NO ENTRY THIS IS
A PRIVATE PROPERTY

266
00:21:00,926 --> 00:21:03,261
Ever seen a grave
at a mountain peak?

267
00:21:03,763 --> 00:21:04,888
It's rare.

268
00:21:06,265 --> 00:21:08,557
Do you know this mountain?

269
00:21:08,558 --> 00:21:10,020
No, never heard of it.

270
00:21:11,310 --> 00:21:14,189
You claim to know every
inch of this land.

271
00:21:14,190 --> 00:21:15,398
How could you not?

272
00:21:16,608 --> 00:21:18,693
I only seek pristine plots.

273
00:22:22,216 --> 00:22:24,259
What an incredible view.

274
00:22:24,260 --> 00:22:25,467
Very nice.

275
00:22:25,468 --> 00:22:28,763
You can even see North Korea
from here. You see that?

276
00:22:33,561 --> 00:22:35,681
The grave itself is quite
plain for such a grand plot.

277
00:23:08,638 --> 00:23:09,763
Do you see something there?

278
00:23:12,183 --> 00:23:13,601
There's no name.

279
00:23:25,028 --> 00:23:29,408
Can you tell me who suggested this
plot for your grandfather's grave?

280
00:23:29,991 --> 00:23:33,871
A famous monk at the time
found the most auspicious plot

281
00:23:35,415 --> 00:23:37,539
because my grandfather made
a significant contribution

282
00:23:37,540 --> 00:23:39,043
- to the country.
- A monk?

283
00:23:39,626 --> 00:23:42,835
Yes, I heard they went by
the Buddhist name "Gisune."

284
00:23:42,836 --> 00:23:44,090
"Gisune"?

285
00:23:45,175 --> 00:23:46,508
That's a unique name.

286
00:23:47,676 --> 00:23:50,595
The grave feels quite plain
despite what you've said.

287
00:23:51,346 --> 00:23:53,430
I was told they decided
on a nondescript one

288
00:23:53,431 --> 00:23:55,768
because of rampant grave
robberies at the time.

289
00:24:06,278 --> 00:24:07,280
What do you think?

290
00:24:08,321 --> 00:24:09,781
I'll settle on a date then.

291
00:24:12,785 --> 00:24:14,493
What is it? Is something off?

292
00:24:20,293 --> 00:24:21,543
Mr. Park.

293
00:24:22,253 --> 00:24:25,465
I don't think I
can take this job.

294
00:24:29,093 --> 00:24:30,719
He's screwing us again.

295
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:31,720
Mr. Kim!

296
00:24:32,971 --> 00:24:34,723
- What is up with him?
- What is it?

297
00:24:35,183 --> 00:24:36,515
Is it that bad?

298
00:24:37,810 --> 00:24:39,478
Is there no way?

299
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:43,148
Why won't you tell us?

300
00:24:47,445 --> 00:24:50,406
It's got a great view and
everything. What's the matter?

301
00:24:51,740 --> 00:24:54,243
You know how much this job pays.

302
00:24:55,118 --> 00:24:57,330
Come on, what's going on?

303
00:25:00,583 --> 00:25:02,665
I'm sure you all understand

304
00:25:02,666 --> 00:25:05,043
what happens if we mess
with the wrong grave.

305
00:25:05,713 --> 00:25:08,339
I've been selling
plots for 40 years now,

306
00:25:08,340 --> 00:25:10,674
but this one is a plot
I've never heard of.

307
00:25:10,675 --> 00:25:11,800
It's vile.

308
00:25:12,970 --> 00:25:17,265
No human should ever be
buried in a place like this.

309
00:25:17,266 --> 00:25:24,105
Dealing with something like that
could get everyone involved killed.

310
00:25:24,106 --> 00:25:25,564
Do you understand?

311
00:25:25,565 --> 00:25:27,443
Hwa-rim, you saw the foxes, no?

312
00:25:30,028 --> 00:25:33,406
Foxes at a gravesite
is an ominous sign.

313
00:25:35,868 --> 00:25:37,786
It's the vilest plot.

314
00:25:48,213 --> 00:25:51,341
That's the last time
I saw my son smile.

315
00:25:52,926 --> 00:25:55,637
We conceived twice before him,

316
00:25:55,638 --> 00:25:57,970
but they were miscarried
for unknown reasons.

317
00:25:57,971 --> 00:25:59,808
We managed to give
birth to him at our age.

318
00:26:01,850 --> 00:26:04,354
Do you have any
children, Mr. Kim?

319
00:26:04,355 --> 00:26:06,355
Yes, I do.

320
00:26:06,356 --> 00:26:08,901
I have a daughter who's
getting married soon.

321
00:26:09,733 --> 00:26:11,485
Congratulations.

322
00:26:11,486 --> 00:26:13,110
Don't even mention it.

323
00:26:13,111 --> 00:26:15,490
Is your daughter in
the same line of work?

324
00:26:15,491 --> 00:26:20,745
She majored in Aerospace Engineering
and works for an airline in Germany.

325
00:26:21,745 --> 00:26:24,250
She's in a frenzy
preparing for her wedding.

326
00:26:25,166 --> 00:26:26,251
Very interesting.

327
00:26:26,875 --> 00:26:30,422
A geomancer father and an
aerospace engineer daughter.

328
00:26:30,423 --> 00:26:34,758
The thing is, if you look
at both fields side-by-side,

329
00:26:35,345 --> 00:26:37,720
they have quite a
lot of similarities.

330
00:26:38,721 --> 00:26:41,599
Yin-yang and the five
elements are about studying

331
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:44,852
water, fire, metal, and wood
with earth as the basis.

332
00:26:44,853 --> 00:26:47,855
It's about analyzing nature
under these conditions,

333
00:26:47,856 --> 00:26:50,191
- and aerospace is about...
- Then...

334
00:26:52,820 --> 00:26:54,488
can't you save my child?

335
00:27:00,158 --> 00:27:02,080
You're hiding something
from us, Mr. Park.

336
00:27:05,583 --> 00:27:06,500
What do you...

337
00:27:06,501 --> 00:27:10,295
38.3417, 128.3189.

338
00:27:10,920 --> 00:27:12,754
A longitude and a latitude.

339
00:27:12,755 --> 00:27:15,467
They were engraved
behind the gravestone.

340
00:27:15,468 --> 00:27:20,555
I don't know who
this Gisune was,

341
00:27:20,556 --> 00:27:24,601
but it's absolutely clear that
they had some kind of intention.

342
00:27:30,690 --> 00:27:33,818
I'm not sure what
you're talking about.

343
00:27:35,278 --> 00:27:36,945
And I'm not hiding
anything from you two.

344
00:27:37,906 --> 00:27:39,490
Let me make it clear.

345
00:27:39,491 --> 00:27:42,535
Relocating a grave from
an unknown plot like that

346
00:27:42,536 --> 00:27:43,913
is extremely dangerous.

347
00:27:44,496 --> 00:27:46,497
It's like digging for
a mine with bare hands.

348
00:27:46,498 --> 00:27:48,500
We could try a
withdrawal ritual.

349
00:27:51,378 --> 00:27:52,711
I knew you'd say that.

350
00:27:55,466 --> 00:27:57,885
We can do it while relocating.

351
00:27:58,968 --> 00:28:01,263
You already know the solution.

352
00:28:01,930 --> 00:28:04,390
I don't trust anything
that I haven't done before.

353
00:28:04,391 --> 00:28:08,938
The combination will be a first, but
it's not theoretically impossible.

354
00:28:09,811 --> 00:28:10,898
Wait.

355
00:28:12,231 --> 00:28:16,277
Why are we waiting
for your permission?

356
00:28:16,278 --> 00:28:18,363
You're not the only
geomancer in the country.

357
00:28:19,198 --> 00:28:21,365
This is why it's tough
working with old geezers.

358
00:28:21,366 --> 00:28:24,620
- Watch it.
- The child is in pain.

359
00:28:33,086 --> 00:28:35,338
This hotel is on a good plot.

360
00:28:38,675 --> 00:28:42,096
The Passing of Misfortune is
a type of deception ritual.

361
00:28:42,805 --> 00:28:45,305
We'll get five diggers
with the pig zodiac sign

362
00:28:45,306 --> 00:28:47,934
and five sacrificial
pigs tied together,

363
00:28:47,935 --> 00:28:50,186
and we'll have the
men dig the grave.

364
00:28:50,895 --> 00:28:54,107
The vile energy from the ground will
then be transferred to the pigs,

365
00:28:54,108 --> 00:28:55,818
which I'll whisk away.

366
00:28:58,403 --> 00:28:59,655
Your aunt is here.

367
00:29:00,238 --> 00:29:02,825
Seems like your mother
shared what's happening.

368
00:31:00,233 --> 00:31:03,986
Let's go!

369
00:31:08,906 --> 00:31:13,080
Let's go!

370
00:31:13,996 --> 00:31:16,208
Here we go!

371
00:31:26,843 --> 00:31:29,805
Let's go!

372
00:31:49,491 --> 00:31:50,868
All right!

373
00:31:52,911 --> 00:31:54,705
Go for it!

374
00:31:57,750 --> 00:32:03,130
- Appease the guardian!
- Appease the guardian!

375
00:32:07,843 --> 00:32:10,846
Exhumation!

376
00:32:11,763 --> 00:32:13,096
Exhumation!

377
00:32:16,851 --> 00:32:18,644
Appease the guardian!

378
00:32:18,645 --> 00:32:21,148
Mountain guardian!

379
00:32:26,195 --> 00:32:28,530
Appease the guardian!

380
00:34:01,040 --> 00:34:02,330
There it is.

381
00:34:11,508 --> 00:34:12,925
Reveal!

382
00:34:12,926 --> 00:34:14,678
- Reveal!
- Reveal!

383
00:34:28,106 --> 00:34:29,776
The chill is immense.

384
00:34:46,375 --> 00:34:48,795
It's too old to
make anything out.

385
00:35:05,353 --> 00:35:06,771
What's this?

386
00:35:07,981 --> 00:35:09,607
It's a coffin made
of juniper tree.

387
00:35:09,608 --> 00:35:12,274
Only the royal
families used this.

388
00:35:12,275 --> 00:35:14,488
I can't believe I'm
seeing this here.

389
00:35:16,865 --> 00:35:19,283
- Coffin removal!
- Coffin removal!

390
00:35:22,285 --> 00:35:24,789
Good, now let's move slowly.

391
00:35:24,790 --> 00:35:27,247
- Lower the head!
- Take it easy.

392
00:35:27,248 --> 00:35:28,249
Careful now.

393
00:35:28,250 --> 00:35:30,667
Load the coffin straight
into the hearse.

394
00:35:30,668 --> 00:35:32,379
We're heading to
the crematorium,

395
00:35:32,380 --> 00:35:35,173
so bury the tombstone and make
sure to tidy up afterward.

396
00:35:36,843 --> 00:35:38,052
Let's swap ropes.

397
00:35:38,053 --> 00:35:40,303
- And remember not to eat meat today.
- Okay.

398
00:35:46,811 --> 00:35:48,561
Thank you for everything.

399
00:35:57,865 --> 00:35:58,865
Yes?

400
00:35:59,616 --> 00:36:02,492
A soul that hasn't even been
shrouded is riding with you.

401
00:36:02,493 --> 00:36:03,733
Let's be respectful, all right?

402
00:36:06,415 --> 00:36:07,288
Come on.

403
00:36:07,289 --> 00:36:09,917
I'm Ko Young-geun, the man who
shrouded the late president.

404
00:36:09,918 --> 00:36:12,210
The job is done, so loosen up.

405
00:36:28,226 --> 00:36:29,226
Let's see.

406
00:36:30,940 --> 00:36:32,147
There's nothing there.

407
00:36:32,148 --> 00:36:33,191
Let's go.

408
00:36:43,160 --> 00:36:44,410
What is that?

409
00:36:44,411 --> 00:36:45,536
Damn it.

410
00:37:31,958 --> 00:37:34,168
What in the world?

411
00:37:56,066 --> 00:37:56,983
Mr. Park.

412
00:37:56,984 --> 00:37:59,192
We'll have to
delay the cremation

413
00:37:59,193 --> 00:38:01,320
because of the
unexpected rainfall.

414
00:38:03,115 --> 00:38:04,280
Why is that?

415
00:38:04,281 --> 00:38:06,242
It's not like it's
done outdoors.

416
00:38:06,243 --> 00:38:09,453
When cremation takes
place on a rainy day,

417
00:38:10,205 --> 00:38:12,831
the soul cannot reach
a good afterlife.

418
00:38:13,415 --> 00:38:15,543
It may sound
superstitious to you,

419
00:38:16,045 --> 00:38:18,485
but I'm letting you know for
professional and ethical reasons.

420
00:38:20,588 --> 00:38:22,676
This happens from time to time.

421
00:38:23,385 --> 00:38:27,805
We can hold the body in
a nearby hospital morgue

422
00:38:27,806 --> 00:38:30,516
and reschedule the cremation
when the weather improves.

423
00:38:31,433 --> 00:38:34,812
Wouldn't we have to submit a funeral
report if we go to a hospital?

424
00:38:34,813 --> 00:38:36,064
Mr. Kim!

425
00:38:36,065 --> 00:38:38,439
I got confirmation!

426
00:38:38,440 --> 00:38:39,817
We're good to go!

427
00:38:39,818 --> 00:38:43,321
Don't worry about that.
We know these people.

428
00:38:47,158 --> 00:38:49,994
Why the entire coffin
even after relocation?

429
00:38:49,995 --> 00:38:52,494
The head mourner
won't let us open it.

430
00:38:52,495 --> 00:38:53,620
Here.

431
00:38:53,621 --> 00:38:55,583
Come on, there's no need.

432
00:38:56,126 --> 00:38:59,670
Don't be that way, take it.

433
00:38:59,671 --> 00:39:01,548
Jeez.

434
00:39:02,548 --> 00:39:05,507
Well, the last group of the day did
just leave, so it's quiet inside.

435
00:39:05,508 --> 00:39:06,720
That's good.

436
00:39:07,220 --> 00:39:09,847
But having it pour
on cremation day,

437
00:39:09,848 --> 00:39:12,350
he's got a long trip
to the afterlife.

438
00:39:21,318 --> 00:39:23,694
They're rescheduling
the cremation?

439
00:39:23,695 --> 00:39:24,988
Yes.

440
00:39:25,821 --> 00:39:28,324
Are you sure you can
trust those people?

441
00:39:28,325 --> 00:39:30,993
I paid them enough and spoke to
them on a need-to-know basis.

442
00:39:31,910 --> 00:39:33,705
You don't need to worry.

443
00:39:34,411 --> 00:39:36,125
Since we've gained some time,

444
00:39:37,375 --> 00:39:40,711
let's consider moving him
to our family gravesite.

445
00:39:42,255 --> 00:39:44,841
I'm still against the cremation.

446
00:39:45,841 --> 00:39:48,551
He was my father, so
I get the say in this.

447
00:39:50,846 --> 00:39:52,098
Go and get some rest.

448
00:39:57,728 --> 00:40:01,982
Let's just leave it here
since we can't open it.

449
00:40:01,983 --> 00:40:04,902
I'll take care of
the humidity level.

450
00:40:04,903 --> 00:40:05,986
Thanks again.

451
00:40:07,655 --> 00:40:09,240
Just look at that coffin.

452
00:40:09,866 --> 00:40:11,825
He must've earned
some royal favors.

453
00:40:13,036 --> 00:40:14,451
Good to see you.

454
00:40:16,790 --> 00:40:19,166
The head mourner and his family
all headed back to Seoul.

455
00:40:20,126 --> 00:40:22,921
But Hwa-rim told me that
she'll join us here.

456
00:40:24,506 --> 00:40:25,880
It's a chilly day.

457
00:40:25,881 --> 00:40:28,260
Go and have some hot soup.

458
00:40:29,593 --> 00:40:30,968
I need to step out for a bit.

459
00:40:31,930 --> 00:40:32,930
All right.

460
00:40:52,615 --> 00:40:55,911
BOGUK TEMPLE

461
00:41:27,401 --> 00:41:29,110
I don't think I've
seen you before.

462
00:41:29,111 --> 00:41:30,111
Can I help you?

463
00:41:30,653 --> 00:41:32,030
Pardon me for intruding.

464
00:41:32,698 --> 00:41:36,702
I saw a sign on the
road while driving by.

465
00:41:36,703 --> 00:41:38,455
Is that so?

466
00:41:39,080 --> 00:41:43,915
It's just that I noticed
the geomancy symbol on it.

467
00:41:43,916 --> 00:41:45,711
I wanted to ask about it.

468
00:41:47,965 --> 00:41:49,214
Are you a geomancer?

469
00:41:49,215 --> 00:41:53,595
Yes, I was a protégé
of Master Choi,

470
00:41:54,220 --> 00:41:58,099
and I'm barely making ends meet
by selling plots on my own.

471
00:41:58,100 --> 00:42:02,936
This place may look shabby now, but
it has existed for over 100 years.

472
00:42:03,645 --> 00:42:07,064
The head monk who
established this temple

473
00:42:07,065 --> 00:42:11,152
was renowned for his
geomancy expertise.

474
00:42:11,153 --> 00:42:12,196
I see.

475
00:42:12,863 --> 00:42:15,947
I can tell just by looking
at the site it's on.

476
00:42:15,948 --> 00:42:17,367
Speaking of which,

477
00:42:17,368 --> 00:42:22,165
was the head monk's name
Gisune by any chance?

478
00:42:23,166 --> 00:42:24,208
Gisune?

479
00:42:24,833 --> 00:42:26,920
No, he was called Wonbong.

480
00:42:27,585 --> 00:42:30,130
May I ask why you're inquiring?

481
00:42:30,131 --> 00:42:32,174
Oh, well...

482
00:42:32,175 --> 00:42:37,429
There's a nameless grave at
the peak of that mountain.

483
00:42:37,430 --> 00:42:39,264
Do you happen to know
anything about it?

484
00:42:39,265 --> 00:42:40,433
Of course.

485
00:42:41,058 --> 00:42:42,976
I'm not sure if
it's still there,

486
00:42:43,645 --> 00:42:47,273
but I heard a lot of rumors
about it back in the day.

487
00:42:49,191 --> 00:42:50,943
What kind of rumors?

488
00:42:51,653 --> 00:42:53,404
Don't stay alone in
this eerie place,

489
00:42:53,405 --> 00:42:55,905
and go have some hot
soup across the street.

490
00:42:55,906 --> 00:42:57,950
Sure, don't worry.

491
00:42:57,951 --> 00:42:59,410
- I'm off.
- Take care.

492
00:43:03,665 --> 00:43:05,541
Why does everyone care
so much about my dinner?

493
00:43:13,756 --> 00:43:17,635
There were rumors of
treasures buried in the grave.

494
00:43:18,555 --> 00:43:19,555
Treasures?

495
00:43:21,516 --> 00:43:25,269
People would say it was the grave
of the richest man in Joseon

496
00:43:25,270 --> 00:43:27,813
or that of an unknown king.

497
00:43:28,398 --> 00:43:32,193
So there were quite a lot of grave
robbers flocking to this area.

498
00:43:33,486 --> 00:43:34,862
Grave robbers?

499
00:43:34,863 --> 00:43:37,447
Some of them were arrested,

500
00:43:37,448 --> 00:43:40,617
while others crossed the
border to North Korea.

501
00:43:40,618 --> 00:43:42,995
So they never got
to rob the grave?

502
00:43:42,996 --> 00:43:44,912
Probably never got a chance to.

503
00:43:44,913 --> 00:43:47,582
I heard it belonged to
a high-ranking official,

504
00:43:47,583 --> 00:43:49,293
so it was hard to
even approach it.

505
00:43:51,128 --> 00:43:54,756
These were the tools
they left behind.

506
00:44:02,431 --> 00:44:05,726
Can I ask why you're
asking about the grave?

507
00:44:10,523 --> 00:44:11,523
Because I...

508
00:44:12,275 --> 00:44:13,816
dug it up today.

509
00:44:21,535 --> 00:44:24,913
So? Were there treasures inside?

510
00:44:41,430 --> 00:44:43,390
Excuse me? What are you doing?

511
00:44:44,556 --> 00:44:45,556
Hey!

512
00:44:51,648 --> 00:44:53,275
Hwa-rim.

513
00:44:53,815 --> 00:44:54,815
Hey, you!

514
00:44:55,360 --> 00:44:57,403
Hwa-rim, are you okay?

515
00:45:01,575 --> 00:45:02,699
What?

516
00:45:02,700 --> 00:45:05,118
What do you mean, the
coffin's been opened?

517
00:45:06,496 --> 00:45:08,622
Damn those sticky
fingers of his.

518
00:45:08,623 --> 00:45:10,665
I paid him enough
to leave it alone.

519
00:45:10,666 --> 00:45:12,043
I knew he felt off.

520
00:45:14,751 --> 00:45:16,590
Hey, what happened?

521
00:45:18,508 --> 00:45:19,841
Something flew past her.

522
00:45:21,678 --> 00:45:22,720
What did?

523
00:45:32,895 --> 00:45:34,481
Something came out of it.

524
00:45:35,566 --> 00:45:36,735
Something very vicious.

525
00:46:16,063 --> 00:46:18,360
Father...

526
00:46:20,611 --> 00:46:24,406
My father.

527
00:46:28,703 --> 00:46:30,371
Jong-soon.

528
00:46:31,623 --> 00:46:33,458
My son.

529
00:46:35,501 --> 00:46:37,628
Open the window.

530
00:46:39,130 --> 00:46:41,381
Father...

531
00:46:43,925 --> 00:46:46,888
Come inside.

532
00:47:15,416 --> 00:47:17,125
Father?

533
00:47:53,580 --> 00:47:58,793
My loyal little boy...

534
00:48:01,001 --> 00:48:05,133
This is a land flowing
with milk and honey.

535
00:48:07,175 --> 00:48:12,348
Your father is cold and hungry.

536
00:48:13,306 --> 00:48:15,226
I'm sorry.

537
00:49:19,290 --> 00:49:22,292
The spirit has got to be
flying wild everywhere.

538
00:49:22,293 --> 00:49:24,084
The head mourner is in danger.

539
00:49:24,085 --> 00:49:27,547
You leave for Seoul
immediately, Mr. Kim.

540
00:49:27,548 --> 00:49:30,717
Meanwhile, we'll try to
summon the spirit back here.

541
00:49:30,718 --> 00:49:33,429
You'll summon it from here?

542
00:49:33,430 --> 00:49:37,641
It screamed to be let out for a century,
only to have nobody free itself.

543
00:49:38,516 --> 00:49:40,186
Only resentment
remains in the spirit.

544
00:49:41,143 --> 00:49:44,356
He'll pay a visit to every
one of his descendants.

545
00:49:51,865 --> 00:49:53,949
What a mess we're in.

546
00:49:53,950 --> 00:49:56,407
It's pouring out, the coffin's
open, and a ghost's on the loose...

547
00:49:56,408 --> 00:49:58,327
I really didn't want to do this.

548
00:49:58,328 --> 00:50:00,248
Tell me about it.

549
00:50:03,626 --> 00:50:06,503
Will you two be okay doing
two rituals in a day?

550
00:50:07,128 --> 00:50:08,756
We'll be fine.

551
00:50:10,006 --> 00:50:12,174
Mr. Ko, make sure to
get the timing right.

552
00:50:12,175 --> 00:50:14,345
- Hold the rope tight when it enters.
- Right.

553
00:51:07,648 --> 00:51:08,733
Come forth.

554
00:51:54,070 --> 00:51:56,278
Here he comes.

555
00:52:07,583 --> 00:52:09,335
Come forth.

556
00:52:13,671 --> 00:52:14,964
He's here.

557
00:52:14,965 --> 00:52:17,299
Bong-gil!

558
00:52:17,300 --> 00:52:18,300
Hold tight!

559
00:52:54,630 --> 00:52:55,631
Hey, old man.

560
00:52:57,091 --> 00:52:58,425
Who are you?

561
00:52:59,676 --> 00:53:00,676
Huh?

562
00:53:02,220 --> 00:53:03,220
Bong-gil, hang onto him!

563
00:53:06,183 --> 00:53:09,936
What got you so riled up?

564
00:53:10,563 --> 00:53:12,730
Talk to me.

565
00:53:13,440 --> 00:53:15,608
Let it all out tonight.

566
00:53:16,733 --> 00:53:18,863
Don't go off elsewhere.

567
00:53:20,488 --> 00:53:22,075
I'm taking...

568
00:53:23,323 --> 00:53:25,035
my children with me.

569
00:53:28,163 --> 00:53:29,415
I can't allow that.

570
00:53:57,485 --> 00:53:58,695
We lost him.

571
00:53:59,360 --> 00:54:00,905
What do we do?

572
00:54:08,245 --> 00:54:09,579
Hello?

573
00:54:09,580 --> 00:54:12,708
Mr. Park, this is Kim
Sang-duk. Is everything okay?

574
00:54:13,835 --> 00:54:16,585
Yes, what's going on?

575
00:54:16,586 --> 00:54:17,880
Thank goodness.

576
00:54:18,378 --> 00:54:20,590
It's just that
there's been a mishap,

577
00:54:20,591 --> 00:54:23,050
so I'm on my way
to you right now.

578
00:54:23,051 --> 00:54:25,300
I know it's late, but could
we talk when I arrive?

579
00:54:25,301 --> 00:54:26,301
What?

580
00:54:27,265 --> 00:54:28,265
What's going on?

581
00:54:29,475 --> 00:54:32,769
You're still at the
same hotel, right?

582
00:54:32,770 --> 00:54:35,813
I'm almost there.
I'll be right up.

583
00:54:36,396 --> 00:54:37,396
One moment.

584
00:54:38,066 --> 00:54:39,275
Who is it?

585
00:54:39,276 --> 00:54:41,485
It's me, Kim Sang-duk.

586
00:54:41,486 --> 00:54:45,533
Hello? What's going on?

587
00:54:46,241 --> 00:54:48,534
Mr. Kim, are you
outside my room?

588
00:54:48,535 --> 00:54:49,869
Excuse me, Mr. Park?

589
00:54:49,870 --> 00:54:52,289
No, no!

590
00:54:52,290 --> 00:54:53,539
That's not me.

591
00:54:53,540 --> 00:54:55,918
Your grandfather's
coffin has been opened.

592
00:54:56,458 --> 00:54:59,004
- What?
- Please open the door!

593
00:54:59,005 --> 00:55:00,045
My grandfather's coffin?

594
00:55:00,046 --> 00:55:02,839
My apologies, but
it was unsealed.

595
00:55:02,840 --> 00:55:04,424
Is something going on inside?

596
00:55:04,425 --> 00:55:07,887
Don't ever open the
door, and just stay put.

597
00:55:07,888 --> 00:55:09,681
- I'm heading your way.
- Mr. Park!

598
00:55:10,265 --> 00:55:14,475
Only listen to me
and act calmly.

599
00:55:14,476 --> 00:55:16,229
Listen carefully, Mr. Park.

600
00:55:16,230 --> 00:55:19,150
Walk away from the door
and get to the window.

601
00:55:22,028 --> 00:55:23,236
Please open the door!

602
00:55:23,946 --> 00:55:26,612
It's an urgent matter I
have to explain to you!

603
00:55:26,613 --> 00:55:28,575
Don't answer, and don't listen.

604
00:55:29,118 --> 00:55:31,660
Go to the window and open it.

605
00:55:31,661 --> 00:55:34,620
Your grandfather will protect
you, so you must let him in.

606
00:55:34,621 --> 00:55:35,916
Mr. Park!

607
00:55:36,708 --> 00:55:38,375
Just listen to me and hurry!

608
00:55:42,505 --> 00:55:43,505
I said, open the window!

609
00:56:24,965 --> 00:56:25,965
Mr. Park!

610
00:56:31,388 --> 00:56:32,390
Mr. Park?

611
00:56:38,518 --> 00:56:39,518
Are you okay?

612
00:56:46,486 --> 00:56:49,073
Proud young men
of the peninsula.

613
00:56:50,031 --> 00:56:53,743
Do you hear the sound of hundreds
of airplanes and artillery?

614
00:56:54,620 --> 00:56:56,953
Push forward, sons
of the Empire!

615
00:56:58,165 --> 00:57:02,170
Raise your bayonets under
the Rising Sun flag!

616
00:57:03,253 --> 00:57:06,172
Serve your devotion
to the Japanese Empire

617
00:57:06,173 --> 00:57:09,926
for the unification
of Greater East Asia!

618
00:57:22,398 --> 00:57:23,398
Ambulance...

619
00:57:23,730 --> 00:57:24,730
Call an ambulance.

620
00:57:25,901 --> 00:57:28,361
Please call an ambulance.

621
00:57:29,238 --> 00:57:30,363
Call a damn ambulance!

622
00:57:36,618 --> 00:57:39,080
I'm telling you, I saw
it with my own two eyes.

623
00:57:39,081 --> 00:57:41,165
This could lead to a
series of funerals!

624
00:57:41,166 --> 00:57:43,334
- We're going to the crematorium.
- All right, get going.

625
00:57:43,335 --> 00:57:46,796
You get their permission to cremate,
and we'll stand by from there.

626
00:58:06,606 --> 00:58:09,319
Your grandfather's coffin is...

627
00:58:09,320 --> 00:58:11,238
The fox severed
the tiger's waist.

628
00:58:13,240 --> 00:58:14,366
Pardon me?

629
00:58:20,956 --> 00:58:23,708
The fox severed
the tiger's waist.

630
00:58:37,265 --> 00:58:39,850
I said the fox severed
the tiger's waist.

631
00:59:07,378 --> 00:59:10,586
Mother, is everything okay?

632
00:59:11,838 --> 00:59:13,966
She must be tired from the trip.

633
00:59:15,676 --> 00:59:17,136
I need to get some rest.

634
00:59:23,643 --> 00:59:25,937
Joseph's condition seems
to be better today.

635
00:59:25,938 --> 00:59:27,102
Doesn't it?

636
00:59:27,103 --> 00:59:28,940
Anyways, I cannot
reach anyone at home.

637
00:59:28,941 --> 00:59:30,441
So I'll go back home and check.

638
00:59:31,026 --> 00:59:32,361
Sure. I'll be here.

639
00:59:38,908 --> 00:59:40,827
It's because this
is an urgent matter!

640
00:59:40,828 --> 00:59:42,287
Have I ever asked for
a favor like this?

641
00:59:42,288 --> 00:59:43,702
It's too late in the night.

642
00:59:43,703 --> 00:59:45,957
We'll be there
soon. Please hurry!

643
00:59:45,958 --> 00:59:48,500
Cremating in this
weather is nonsense.

644
00:59:48,501 --> 00:59:49,585
What did the mourner say?

645
00:59:49,586 --> 00:59:51,588
I told you, something
came out of the coffin!

646
00:59:52,171 --> 00:59:53,381
You must know what that means.

647
00:59:54,258 --> 00:59:55,938
The body needs to be
cremated immediately.

648
00:59:56,510 --> 00:59:58,469
Please call his
family in the US.

649
00:59:58,470 --> 01:00:00,805
Pardon? What do you mean?

650
01:00:00,806 --> 01:00:02,390
You saw what happened.

651
01:00:02,391 --> 01:00:04,435
The baby is next.

652
01:00:31,711 --> 01:00:33,838
No one in the US is answering.

653
01:00:36,341 --> 01:00:37,341
Then...

654
01:00:57,111 --> 01:00:58,112
What's this?

655
01:00:58,113 --> 01:01:00,073
You exhumed the coffin but
didn't shroud the body?

656
01:01:00,615 --> 01:01:02,116
You'll cremate
the entire coffin?

657
01:01:03,368 --> 01:01:05,828
Things will get messy if
the town office finds out.

658
01:01:11,335 --> 01:01:12,877
My father's coffin?

659
01:01:12,878 --> 01:01:14,920
I don't quite
understand it myself.

660
01:01:14,921 --> 01:01:17,256
But he said it has to
be cremated immediately.

661
01:01:17,840 --> 01:01:19,840
What do you mean?

662
01:01:19,841 --> 01:01:22,554
Ma'am, we must hurry.

663
01:01:22,555 --> 01:01:26,350
Your father's spirit is
headed to the baby in the US.

664
01:01:48,663 --> 01:01:50,245
- I'll fire it up.
- One second.

665
01:01:50,246 --> 01:01:52,459
The mourner hasn't
given us the go yet.

666
01:01:52,460 --> 01:01:54,377
We're unable to reach
your family in the US.

667
01:01:54,378 --> 01:01:57,631
Only you can give us the
permission to cremate the coffin.

668
01:02:18,610 --> 01:02:21,530
Is this really the only way?

669
01:02:39,381 --> 01:02:40,381
Very well.

670
01:02:41,341 --> 01:02:42,550
Please proceed.

671
01:02:42,551 --> 01:02:43,551
Yes, ma'am.

672
01:02:46,138 --> 01:02:47,138
Burn it.

673
01:03:10,326 --> 01:03:12,038
What a terrible fate.

674
01:03:12,623 --> 01:03:14,250
Too bad he won't reach
a good afterlife.

675
01:04:02,673 --> 01:04:08,345
Off on a journey

676
01:04:09,135 --> 01:04:15,016
Off on a journey

677
01:04:16,645 --> 01:04:21,816
Beach rose of Myeongsasimni

678
01:04:22,651 --> 01:04:27,656
Flowers bloom, leaves
fall Do not be saddened

679
01:04:40,335 --> 01:04:45,420
Which saint led your bier?

680
01:04:45,421 --> 01:04:50,051
- Why has the grim reaper appeared?
- Why has the grim reaper appeared?

681
01:05:02,481 --> 01:05:04,901
Re-routing to your destination.

682
01:05:10,946 --> 01:05:12,366
Remember Chang-min, Mr. Kim?

683
01:05:13,075 --> 01:05:16,787
He said he's fallen sick
after the exhumation.

684
01:05:16,788 --> 01:05:19,749
Would you mind giving him a
visit when things cool down?

685
01:05:19,750 --> 01:05:21,876
Make a left turn.

686
01:05:22,458 --> 01:05:24,209
The hospital is clueless.

687
01:05:24,210 --> 01:05:26,506
I just wasted money
on a bunch of tests.

688
01:05:28,300 --> 01:05:32,468
I have nightmares
and hallucinations.

689
01:05:33,930 --> 01:05:34,930
Mr. Kim...

690
01:05:37,558 --> 01:05:39,936
I think I'm getting
punished by the gods.

691
01:05:41,855 --> 01:05:45,275
I saw something while cleaning
up after the exhumation that day.

692
01:05:46,610 --> 01:05:47,903
It looked so strange.

693
01:05:49,235 --> 01:05:50,530
It was a snake...

694
01:05:51,281 --> 01:05:52,531
What? A snake?

695
01:05:53,783 --> 01:05:55,826
Damn it, I should've
just let it be.

696
01:05:57,243 --> 01:05:59,915
Please do me a favor, Mr. Kim.

697
01:06:00,581 --> 01:06:04,336
Find the snake I cut in half and
say a prayer to it, will you?

698
01:06:08,631 --> 01:06:11,050
I really didn't want
to go there that day.

699
01:06:11,051 --> 01:06:12,508
I really didn't want to.

700
01:06:13,220 --> 01:06:16,473
That place felt weird to
begin with, didn't it?

701
01:06:17,640 --> 01:06:19,391
Why was a grave there
in the first place?

702
01:08:05,205 --> 01:08:06,248
Double interment.

703
01:08:07,166 --> 01:08:08,710
Yes, I'm busy.

704
01:08:09,250 --> 01:08:11,210
I'm doing a Bible study
with church friends.

705
01:08:11,211 --> 01:08:12,840
Here's 50,000 won for you.

706
01:08:13,465 --> 01:08:14,465
Go.

707
01:08:14,800 --> 01:08:15,841
What?

708
01:08:18,428 --> 01:08:19,470
A double interment?

709
01:08:19,471 --> 01:08:21,181
Yes, just under the coffin.

710
01:08:22,181 --> 01:08:23,433
By the way, Mr. Ko,

711
01:08:24,058 --> 01:08:26,518
have you ever seen a
coffin buried vertically?

712
01:08:30,690 --> 01:08:31,691
Yes?

713
01:08:33,860 --> 01:08:34,945
Hwa-rim?

714
01:08:35,986 --> 01:08:37,030
Here we go.

715
01:08:37,990 --> 01:08:39,238
In two beats.

716
01:08:53,213 --> 01:08:57,216
Coffins could go vertical
when the ground shifts...

717
01:08:59,010 --> 01:09:00,551
but still, this is too big.

718
01:09:02,138 --> 01:09:03,390
What the hell is this?

719
01:09:09,353 --> 01:09:10,980
What's that about?

720
01:09:19,781 --> 01:09:20,990
I think this chain...

721
01:09:22,281 --> 01:09:24,450
is to prevent someone
from opening it.

722
01:09:26,120 --> 01:09:27,873
- Or...
- Or what?

723
01:09:28,540 --> 01:09:29,706
Or the opposite.

724
01:09:33,170 --> 01:09:34,795
Let's pull it out
and examine it.

725
01:09:34,796 --> 01:09:36,462
For what?

726
01:09:36,463 --> 01:09:38,840
We should contact
the mourners first.

727
01:09:38,841 --> 01:09:40,634
We've got the payment
left to discuss too.

728
01:09:40,635 --> 01:09:43,805
Let's not mess with this.

729
01:09:48,976 --> 01:09:50,061
Let's pull it out first.

730
01:09:50,726 --> 01:09:52,727
I'm sure it belongs
to the family.

731
01:09:52,728 --> 01:09:55,191
We can't just
leave it like this.

732
01:09:56,651 --> 01:09:58,235
But how do we...

733
01:09:58,903 --> 01:10:00,570
Let's pull it out.
Go get a rope.

734
01:10:00,571 --> 01:10:01,781
Hurry, the sun's setting.

735
01:10:05,785 --> 01:10:07,661
Pull hard on the count of three.

736
01:10:08,370 --> 01:10:10,290
One, two, three!

737
01:10:26,055 --> 01:10:27,513
How is that for a human?

738
01:11:16,981 --> 01:11:18,775
Where is he going?

739
01:11:24,906 --> 01:11:25,906
BOGUK TEMPLE

740
01:11:38,418 --> 01:11:39,584
What's going on?

741
01:11:39,585 --> 01:11:43,216
As I told you on the phone, we
had an emergency exhumation.

742
01:11:43,715 --> 01:11:45,801
Please allow us
to stay overnight.

743
01:11:48,388 --> 01:11:50,390
The mourner is on her way.

744
01:11:51,181 --> 01:11:53,685
Is there space to store
the coffin in the meantime?

745
01:12:13,620 --> 01:12:14,620
What...

746
01:12:15,371 --> 01:12:17,333
exactly is that?

747
01:12:19,543 --> 01:12:24,256
Could I trouble you for
some glutinous rice?

748
01:12:40,273 --> 01:12:41,148
Bong-gil.

749
01:12:41,149 --> 01:12:43,110
Get the horse
blood from the car.

750
01:12:48,530 --> 01:12:50,241
You know this
isn't a good thing.

751
01:12:55,705 --> 01:12:57,206
Double interment?

752
01:12:57,788 --> 01:12:59,375
What does that mean?

753
01:13:00,085 --> 01:13:03,503
Please tell us
everything you know.

754
01:13:04,255 --> 01:13:05,421
I don't know.

755
01:13:06,090 --> 01:13:08,050
I really don't know...

756
01:13:10,178 --> 01:13:12,263
why that thing was buried there.

757
01:13:12,971 --> 01:13:17,433
Nor do I know why my father
was buried in such a bad plot.

758
01:13:18,353 --> 01:13:20,936
It was written on the tombstone.

759
01:13:22,065 --> 01:13:25,110
"Vice Chairman of the
Central Advisory Committee."

760
01:13:25,985 --> 01:13:30,490
Your father was quite a figure who
acted as a quisling for the country.

761
01:13:31,198 --> 01:13:34,284
So I'm assuming the monk
intended to punish him...

762
01:13:34,285 --> 01:13:35,620
Yes, I know.

763
01:13:37,330 --> 01:13:39,040
That's why I don't understand.

764
01:13:41,041 --> 01:13:43,001
That monk named Gisune...

765
01:13:45,213 --> 01:13:46,838
he wasn't Korean,

766
01:13:48,925 --> 01:13:50,093
but Japanese.

767
01:13:51,466 --> 01:13:53,262
- Pardon?
- A Japanese?

768
01:13:53,263 --> 01:13:56,348
His real name was
Murayama Junji.

769
01:13:59,060 --> 01:14:03,231
I heard he knew every
inch of this country.

770
01:14:03,730 --> 01:14:06,399
My father pledged
allegiance to them,

771
01:14:06,400 --> 01:14:10,486
so why bury him in the
worst plot in the country?

772
01:14:15,118 --> 01:14:18,246
I've received a call from
the US that the baby is fine.

773
01:14:18,995 --> 01:14:21,958
I'll honor the payment
Ji-yong promised you all,

774
01:14:22,748 --> 01:14:23,748
so please...

775
01:14:25,211 --> 01:14:27,046
get rid of that
coffin as you see fit.

776
01:14:54,365 --> 01:14:55,656
Let's burn it right away.

777
01:14:57,868 --> 01:14:58,868
All right.

778
01:15:00,911 --> 01:15:03,207
Let's burn it first
thing in the morning.

779
01:15:03,208 --> 01:15:05,541
I agree. I'll feel
so much better.

780
01:15:07,461 --> 01:15:08,461
Excuse me.

781
01:15:09,045 --> 01:15:12,132
I made some noodles, so
come warm up for a bit.

782
01:15:12,133 --> 01:15:13,674
Thank you.

783
01:15:13,675 --> 01:15:15,469
- Shall we?
- This way.

784
01:15:15,470 --> 01:15:19,222
I knew that grave was off. It
had a good view for nothing.

785
01:15:19,223 --> 01:15:21,100
We haven't eaten
anything all day.

786
01:15:28,023 --> 01:15:30,900
Please have a drink of this.

787
01:15:30,901 --> 01:15:32,861
Thank you so much.

788
01:15:33,446 --> 01:15:35,322
Thank you for the food.

789
01:15:35,323 --> 01:15:37,032
- Cheers to our health.
- Cheers.

790
01:15:37,033 --> 01:15:38,743
The flavor is...

791
01:15:41,788 --> 01:15:44,122
This is really precious stuff.

792
01:15:44,123 --> 01:15:45,955
Have a drink.

793
01:15:45,956 --> 01:15:47,043
It's warming me up.

794
01:15:49,253 --> 01:15:50,421
Is there any more of the...

795
01:16:01,641 --> 01:16:03,767
Yes, Murayama Junji.

796
01:16:03,768 --> 01:16:08,355
You don't remember? Master
mentioned him a few times.

797
01:16:08,356 --> 01:16:11,818
He was a Fox Diviner in Japan.

798
01:16:13,068 --> 01:16:16,695
That's right, Diviner Murayama.

799
01:16:16,696 --> 01:16:19,614
Master met him once
a long time ago.

800
01:16:19,615 --> 01:16:22,494
I remember hearing that his energy
was too intense to be a human.

801
01:16:22,495 --> 01:16:24,246
That he was most
certainly a fox.

802
01:16:24,788 --> 01:16:25,914
Why do you ask?

803
01:16:25,915 --> 01:16:26,957
Where are you?

804
01:16:26,958 --> 01:16:29,793
It's nothing. I remember now.

805
01:16:30,378 --> 01:16:31,838
Thank you, Gwang-sim.

806
01:16:32,796 --> 01:16:34,048
I'll call back soon.

807
01:16:40,846 --> 01:16:42,056
Grandma.

808
01:16:43,723 --> 01:16:44,890
Grandma...

809
01:16:49,605 --> 01:16:51,356
I have a bad feeling.

810
01:17:49,705 --> 01:17:52,790
My liver was taken, my liver.

811
01:17:52,791 --> 01:17:53,920
My liver.

812
01:17:58,591 --> 01:18:00,634
My liver was taken.

813
01:18:00,635 --> 01:18:06,932
Someone took my liver.
Someone took it.

814
01:18:06,933 --> 01:18:08,057
My liver was taken.

815
01:18:08,058 --> 01:18:10,225
Where are my clothes?

816
01:18:10,226 --> 01:18:12,228
My clothes.

817
01:18:13,898 --> 01:18:15,190
Fuck.

818
01:18:15,191 --> 01:18:18,107
Someone took my
liver and my clothes.

819
01:18:18,108 --> 01:18:19,153
My liver.

820
01:20:12,766 --> 01:20:13,810
Hwa-rim.

821
01:20:29,240 --> 01:20:30,451
Damn it.

822
01:20:39,668 --> 01:20:41,086
Fuck, what a stench.

823
01:20:57,228 --> 01:20:59,480
It went through the roof
because of the seal.

824
01:21:03,776 --> 01:21:05,193
This thing...

825
01:21:07,946 --> 01:21:09,029
What the hell is it?

826
01:21:09,030 --> 01:21:10,030
Say it.

827
01:21:12,618 --> 01:21:16,330
I think this thing is
at the pigpen right now.

828
01:21:18,081 --> 01:21:19,458
Go and wake everyone up.

829
01:22:38,830 --> 01:22:41,080
The gate has been opened.

830
01:22:43,291 --> 01:22:44,876
Is there a human?

831
01:22:48,965 --> 01:22:51,966
I came for my helmet.

832
01:22:52,843 --> 01:22:54,303
Is there a human?

833
01:22:56,095 --> 01:23:01,100
No, my lord, I am not a human.

834
01:23:02,186 --> 01:23:04,646
I am your servant.

835
01:23:08,566 --> 01:23:10,108
Very well.

836
01:23:11,110 --> 01:23:15,155
Then have you brought me
the sweetfish and melons?

837
01:23:19,495 --> 01:23:23,248
Do you not hear your lord?

838
01:23:25,333 --> 01:23:28,755
I have brought the head
of the enemy general.

839
01:23:38,221 --> 01:23:39,931
I'm sorry, my lord.

840
01:23:41,181 --> 01:23:43,308
I will prepare the
sweetfish for you.

841
01:24:11,586 --> 01:24:14,050
A human.

842
01:24:36,195 --> 01:24:37,196
Run.

843
01:24:37,948 --> 01:24:39,198
Bong-gil.

844
01:25:14,443 --> 01:25:15,443
Bong-gil.

845
01:25:35,923 --> 01:25:37,716
A pagoda.

846
01:27:47,846 --> 01:27:49,098
Bong-gil.

847
01:27:50,725 --> 01:27:51,600
Bong-gil!

848
01:27:51,601 --> 01:27:53,518
Bong-gil, stay with me.

849
01:27:55,310 --> 01:27:59,732
350,000 won and 750,000
for Kim Young-ja...

850
01:27:59,733 --> 01:28:04,445
- Bong-gil, wake up!
- They owe me 200,000 won...

851
01:28:05,948 --> 01:28:07,491
Mr. Kim, please help!

852
01:28:08,158 --> 01:28:09,868
He needs help!

853
01:28:11,786 --> 01:28:13,870
Please help!

854
01:28:13,871 --> 01:28:15,290
He needs help.

855
01:28:15,958 --> 01:28:19,710
Bong-gil, stay with us.

856
01:28:32,140 --> 01:28:35,559
A wild bear attack
terrorizing the villagers...

857
01:28:35,560 --> 01:28:38,937
Your temperatures aren't dropping,
so I'll give you something for that.

858
01:28:38,938 --> 01:28:44,194
The local police found pigs
that were shredded to pieces,

859
01:28:44,195 --> 01:28:48,322
as well as two human bodies in
the same condition near the scene.

860
01:28:48,323 --> 01:28:53,535
The victims were found to be a local monk
and a migrant laborer who worked on-site.

861
01:28:53,536 --> 01:28:58,498
Town officials are working in hand with
the military to track down the bear...

862
01:29:28,280 --> 01:29:29,280
I'm sorry.

863
01:29:30,781 --> 01:29:33,076
I shouldn't have asked
to pull out the coffin.

864
01:29:34,620 --> 01:29:35,955
I'm sorry about Bong-gil...

865
01:29:38,413 --> 01:29:39,833
and the monk too.

866
01:29:42,043 --> 01:29:45,713
When Bong-gil had to quit baseball
after being chosen by the spirits...

867
01:29:48,591 --> 01:29:51,761
and when he came to us after
being abandoned by his family,

868
01:29:52,553 --> 01:29:55,015
we all told him not
to become a shaman.

869
01:29:57,308 --> 01:29:59,352
But he said he'd be okay

870
01:29:59,353 --> 01:30:02,648
and that he had nothing to
fear as long as he was with me.

871
01:30:10,906 --> 01:30:12,783
I panicked, and I froze.

872
01:30:21,875 --> 01:30:23,210
It left footprints.

873
01:30:24,085 --> 01:30:25,460
And casted shadows too.

874
01:30:26,711 --> 01:30:29,840
There is an established
theory in shamanism.

875
01:30:30,885 --> 01:30:33,803
Souls are only fragmentary, and
ghosts lack physical bodies,

876
01:30:35,971 --> 01:30:39,392
meaning they can never
conquer us humans

877
01:30:39,393 --> 01:30:41,645
with complete minds
and intact bodies.

878
01:30:42,938 --> 01:30:46,275
But that thing we saw is
something completely different.

879
01:30:47,358 --> 01:30:50,528
It's not a vengeful spirit
but rather an anima.

880
01:30:52,030 --> 01:30:52,948
An anima?

881
01:30:52,949 --> 01:30:54,407
It comes to be

882
01:30:54,408 --> 01:30:56,991
when a human or animal soul
evolves with an object.

883
01:30:59,120 --> 01:31:01,621
It's something that shouldn't
ever exist on this land.

884
01:31:05,668 --> 01:31:07,796
I couldn't sense
anything from it.

885
01:31:09,173 --> 01:31:12,091
What its identity is,
where it came from,

886
01:31:13,135 --> 01:31:15,635
or why it was in the
Park family's grave...

887
01:31:21,226 --> 01:31:23,518
He suffered damage to
his abdominal organs.

888
01:31:24,271 --> 01:31:25,603
And he lost a lot of blood.

889
01:31:26,440 --> 01:31:29,150
But the real problem is
the damage to the spine.

890
01:31:30,068 --> 01:31:32,070
He needs to be sent
to a general hospital.

891
01:31:33,155 --> 01:31:34,905
Since it was a wild
animal attack...

892
01:31:41,330 --> 01:31:43,330
THE BACKBONE OF THE PENINSULA

893
01:31:43,331 --> 01:31:44,832
THE BACKBONE

894
01:31:44,833 --> 01:31:47,335
The fox severed
the tiger's waist.

895
01:32:08,440 --> 01:32:10,149
I was told they decided
on a nondescript one

896
01:32:10,150 --> 01:32:12,192
because of rampant grave
robberies at the time.

897
01:32:12,193 --> 01:32:16,946
The grave robbers' tools are
still stored in the shed.

898
01:32:46,478 --> 01:32:49,729
"Our land, my comrades."

899
01:32:49,730 --> 01:32:51,025
"Iron Blood Alliance"?

900
01:32:57,321 --> 01:33:00,032
We've prevented further
organ damage for now

901
01:33:00,033 --> 01:33:03,452
and we'll need to
conduct more tests,

902
01:33:03,453 --> 01:33:06,081
but he'll need to regain
consciousness for that.

903
01:33:07,081 --> 01:33:08,601
I must say, his case
is quite unusual.

904
01:33:09,376 --> 01:33:11,502
What in the world
is with all this?

905
01:33:11,503 --> 01:33:15,797
Thankfully, he's out of the
woods but he injured his spine.

906
01:33:15,798 --> 01:33:17,049
Will he be able to walk?

907
01:33:17,050 --> 01:33:20,053
He'll have to work through
it, which I'm sure he will.

908
01:33:22,180 --> 01:33:23,887
What have you been up to?

909
01:33:23,888 --> 01:33:25,266
Spill it.

910
01:33:26,476 --> 01:33:28,310
- Gwang-sim.
- Yes?

911
01:33:28,311 --> 01:33:30,020
I smell a stench from him.

912
01:33:33,023 --> 01:33:35,068
I know. That's why
I called you two.

913
01:33:35,860 --> 01:33:38,028
It's been a while since we
played goblins, hasn't it?

914
01:33:39,948 --> 01:33:41,408
Why are you standing
around, Ja-hye?

915
01:33:41,950 --> 01:33:42,950
Go lock the door.

916
01:33:52,126 --> 01:33:55,712
Bae Ji-dang, Lee Chung-gu,

917
01:33:55,713 --> 01:33:59,551
Park Gil-ho, Shin Pal-gyun,

918
01:34:00,843 --> 01:34:04,680
Kim Jung-bok, Song Jong-ik,

919
01:34:05,223 --> 01:34:08,434
Min Geun-ho,

920
01:34:08,435 --> 01:34:11,521
Jeon Tae-hwan, and Im Chung-sin.

921
01:34:12,898 --> 01:34:13,898
I knew it.

922
01:34:14,566 --> 01:34:18,111
They look too resolute
to be grave robbers.

923
01:34:46,805 --> 01:34:49,975
Ladies, it's been so long.

924
01:34:50,518 --> 01:34:51,809
Is everyone here?

925
01:34:51,810 --> 01:34:53,562
I just got here.

926
01:34:53,563 --> 01:34:57,024
The harvest is over, and
it's getting cold now.

927
01:34:57,025 --> 01:34:58,275
Is everyone well?

928
01:34:58,276 --> 01:35:03,155
With you all here, I
should've cooked something.

929
01:35:03,156 --> 01:35:04,949
Don't you worry.

930
01:35:04,950 --> 01:35:09,077
I brought rice cakes and
plenty of boiled pork.

931
01:35:09,078 --> 01:35:12,664
I knew I smelled
something tasty.

932
01:35:12,665 --> 01:35:14,207
Did you bring enough?

933
01:35:14,208 --> 01:35:16,794
Of course, I brought plenty.

934
01:35:16,795 --> 01:35:19,087
There's more than enough
for all three of us.

935
01:35:19,088 --> 01:35:23,007
Should I get Mr. Jang over yonder
and the miss over at Jecheon too?

936
01:35:23,008 --> 01:35:25,009
Why fetch those busy bees?

937
01:35:25,010 --> 01:35:27,179
Let's just eat quietly
by ourselves...

938
01:35:27,180 --> 01:35:31,601
Yes, let's not bring others.
Did you bring some sweetfish?

939
01:35:37,481 --> 01:35:38,400
Who's that?

940
01:35:38,401 --> 01:35:42,860
- I think Mr. Yoon is here.
- No way.

941
01:35:42,861 --> 01:35:44,447
Didn't you hear what
happened to him?

942
01:35:44,448 --> 01:35:48,282
Yes, there's no way he came.

943
01:35:48,283 --> 01:35:51,204
What are you talking about?
Fill me in, will you?

944
01:35:51,205 --> 01:35:52,621
Don't even mention it.

945
01:35:53,788 --> 01:35:56,417
I heard he met something
really vicious.

946
01:35:56,418 --> 01:36:01,214
How vicious was it for
him to be bedridden?

947
01:36:01,215 --> 01:36:02,215
Haven't you heard?

948
01:36:03,550 --> 01:36:05,718
He met someone in the
middle of the night.

949
01:36:07,553 --> 01:36:09,556
What a load of shit.

950
01:36:11,181 --> 01:36:13,018
Hey, Mr. Yoon.

951
01:36:14,058 --> 01:36:16,480
What did you see
that scared you much?

952
01:36:19,148 --> 01:36:21,401
He looks just fine.

953
01:36:22,443 --> 01:36:23,653
Who was it?

954
01:36:24,903 --> 01:36:26,740
The one you met.

955
01:36:27,698 --> 01:36:29,158
Can you tell us?

956
01:36:31,951 --> 01:36:34,913
The lord.

957
01:36:36,206 --> 01:36:37,206
The lord?

958
01:36:38,460 --> 01:36:39,753
Which one?

959
01:36:46,468 --> 01:36:49,470
Spit it out, asshole.

960
01:36:57,101 --> 01:37:01,525
My lord, the one who
cut down 10,000 foes.

961
01:37:06,488 --> 01:37:07,861
Where...

962
01:37:09,575 --> 01:37:11,326
is your lord now?

963
01:37:32,721 --> 01:37:35,932
38.3417, 128.3189.

964
01:37:35,933 --> 01:37:39,563
38.3417, 128.3189.

965
01:37:40,605 --> 01:37:44,023
38.3417, 128.3189.

966
01:37:45,900 --> 01:37:47,320
It's a Japanese ghost.

967
01:37:48,780 --> 01:37:53,408
He's the general
who guards the site.

968
01:38:09,718 --> 01:38:11,345
What the hell is that?

969
01:38:14,053 --> 01:38:16,683
My lord, please look at me!

970
01:38:17,641 --> 01:38:19,769
I'm right here.

971
01:38:19,770 --> 01:38:21,521
I wish to be your vessel!

972
01:38:36,870 --> 01:38:39,748
I'll offer him that meat.

973
01:38:41,456 --> 01:38:42,583
Ja-hye.

974
01:38:43,626 --> 01:38:44,836
Come closer.

975
01:38:45,628 --> 01:38:47,505
Please help me, Ja-hye.

976
01:38:54,218 --> 01:38:58,433
All of you bitches
are going to die.

977
01:39:11,946 --> 01:39:13,697
Don't do this, Hwa-rim.

978
01:39:13,698 --> 01:39:15,157
It's a Japanese ghost.

979
01:39:15,158 --> 01:39:16,617
I know.

980
01:39:16,618 --> 01:39:21,496
They kill anything and
everything just for being nearby.

981
01:39:22,956 --> 01:39:24,624
You saw what happened in Japan.

982
01:39:24,625 --> 01:39:27,001
Don't you dare even go near it.

983
01:39:28,338 --> 01:39:32,925
Even with your grandma
protecting you, this isn't right.

984
01:39:33,426 --> 01:39:34,468
Let's go, Ja-hye.

985
01:39:35,010 --> 01:39:36,471
What about Bong-gil then?

986
01:39:39,640 --> 01:39:41,516
I'll call you. Let's go.

987
01:39:56,991 --> 01:39:58,743
So that thing was really
buried down there?

988
01:40:00,453 --> 01:40:02,536
That means it's returned
to where it was.

989
01:40:03,873 --> 01:40:06,460
But why did you go back
there in the first place?

990
01:40:08,670 --> 01:40:11,170
Before Mr. Park died, he said,

991
01:40:13,131 --> 01:40:16,010
"The fox severed
the tiger's waist."

992
01:40:17,761 --> 01:40:19,177
What does it mean?

993
01:40:19,178 --> 01:40:23,558
In geomancy, our peninsula is
metaphorically compared to a tiger,

994
01:40:24,685 --> 01:40:26,813
one that is grasping
the continent.

995
01:40:27,396 --> 01:40:28,273
So?

996
01:40:28,274 --> 01:40:32,025
Remember the coordinates
written on the gravestone?

997
01:40:32,026 --> 01:40:33,527
Where could it be?

998
01:40:33,528 --> 01:40:35,612
That's right, that's the spot.

999
01:40:35,613 --> 01:40:37,655
That's exactly where
the tiger's waist is.

1000
01:40:37,656 --> 01:40:40,368
That Fox Diviner
Hwa-rim mentioned,

1001
01:40:41,325 --> 01:40:42,870
that fox bastard...

1002
01:40:44,371 --> 01:40:46,455
put it there just like that!

1003
01:40:46,456 --> 01:40:48,710
He drove a stake
right on the spot.

1004
01:40:53,631 --> 01:40:56,050
What about Park's
coffin on top of it?

1005
01:40:58,386 --> 01:41:02,722
Since these resolute-looking men
were roaming about pulling them out,

1006
01:41:02,723 --> 01:41:05,474
they intentionally buried a
high-ranking official on top of it.

1007
01:41:05,475 --> 01:41:07,144
So that they couldn't
even go near it.

1008
01:41:07,145 --> 01:41:09,478
Then why is the ghost there?

1009
01:41:14,108 --> 01:41:19,156
He's the general
who guards the site.

1010
01:41:24,036 --> 01:41:27,873
38.3417, 128.3189.

1011
01:41:28,623 --> 01:41:29,876
I think...

1012
01:41:30,876 --> 01:41:32,920
that's what's guarding
the iron stake.

1013
01:41:47,601 --> 01:41:48,686
Hwa-rim.

1014
01:41:49,186 --> 01:41:51,690
I know we're based on a
business relationship,

1015
01:41:52,898 --> 01:41:54,859
but let me ask you a
favor aside from business.

1016
01:41:54,860 --> 01:41:57,027
Don't say anything
you'll regret later.

1017
01:41:57,028 --> 01:41:58,527
Do you still believe

1018
01:41:58,528 --> 01:42:02,365
in national spirit, or how Korea was
divided in half with iron stakes?

1019
01:42:02,366 --> 01:42:06,452
You know those stakes at the
temples are for land surveying.

1020
01:42:06,453 --> 01:42:09,622
You know they say
99% of them are fake.

1021
01:42:09,623 --> 01:42:10,625
What about the 1% then?

1022
01:42:12,793 --> 01:42:14,837
- Mr. Ko.
- What is it?

1023
01:42:14,838 --> 01:42:17,254
You know this isn't
just an ordinary grave.

1024
01:42:17,255 --> 01:42:19,256
This was planned meticulously.

1025
01:42:20,926 --> 01:42:24,427
You saw people die
because of that grave.

1026
01:42:24,428 --> 01:42:26,389
Do you really want to be next?

1027
01:42:26,390 --> 01:42:27,430
Mr. Kim.

1028
01:42:27,431 --> 01:42:32,685
Stake or not, we lived our lives
just fine without big trouble.

1029
01:42:32,686 --> 01:42:34,605
So why the change of heart?

1030
01:42:34,606 --> 01:42:35,606
You're right.

1031
01:42:36,400 --> 01:42:41,445
You and I lived prosperously,
selling land to rich pricks.

1032
01:42:42,156 --> 01:42:43,532
That's what bothers me.

1033
01:42:43,533 --> 01:42:45,535
This is about that same land!

1034
01:42:47,326 --> 01:42:50,664
The land that my unborn grandchild
will step on and live on.

1035
01:42:50,665 --> 01:42:53,457
The same land for all of us

1036
01:42:53,458 --> 01:42:55,253
and our future generations.

1037
01:42:59,006 --> 01:43:01,550
Hwa-rim, you said it's an anima.

1038
01:43:01,551 --> 01:43:04,177
If it really is an anima
attached to the iron,

1039
01:43:04,178 --> 01:43:06,720
we just have to pull
out that iron stake.

1040
01:43:06,721 --> 01:43:09,598
With that done, Bong-gil
will recover, no?

1041
01:43:15,355 --> 01:43:18,984
But that general or
whatever is guarding it.

1042
01:43:18,985 --> 01:43:21,234
How the hell are we
supposed to pull it out?

1043
01:43:21,235 --> 01:43:23,906
You saw the size of that thing.

1044
01:43:25,783 --> 01:43:27,868
Summon like a beast,

1045
01:43:30,163 --> 01:43:31,915
speak like an anima.

1046
01:43:35,126 --> 01:43:37,044
You really think it's doable?

1047
01:43:37,045 --> 01:43:39,627
There are things we can pull
off and things we can't.

1048
01:43:39,628 --> 01:43:41,090
I'm sorry to say that ghost

1049
01:43:42,091 --> 01:43:43,633
isn't something that
can be cast away.

1050
01:43:44,718 --> 01:43:50,390
Japanese ghosts don't need a reason
to kill anything in their path.

1051
01:43:52,310 --> 01:43:55,105
We may not be able
to get rid of it,

1052
01:43:58,316 --> 01:43:59,900
but I can distract it for a bit.

1053
01:44:01,695 --> 01:44:03,653
I can buy us time.

1054
01:44:12,705 --> 01:44:13,915
Bong-gil.

1055
01:44:17,001 --> 01:44:19,585
Pass me some more
antiseptic, please.

1056
01:44:19,586 --> 01:44:21,796
I'll wipe it with saline
and apply gauze over it.

1057
01:44:22,380 --> 01:44:23,380
Yes, ma'am.

1058
01:44:24,050 --> 01:44:25,135
Wait.

1059
01:44:30,430 --> 01:44:32,350
That bastard avoided the tattoo.

1060
01:44:33,476 --> 01:44:35,061
What kind of tattoo is that?

1061
01:44:36,353 --> 01:44:37,730
It's a Buddhist scripture.

1062
01:45:02,963 --> 01:45:04,131
My apologies,

1063
01:45:04,965 --> 01:45:07,591
but we had some reports of wild
animal activities in the area.

1064
01:45:10,180 --> 01:45:11,263
Where...

1065
01:45:12,265 --> 01:45:13,598
Where might you...

1066
01:45:14,723 --> 01:45:16,770
be headed?

1067
01:45:17,811 --> 01:45:22,275
We're here to weed out
graves in that mountain.

1068
01:45:22,856 --> 01:45:23,856
I see.

1069
01:45:24,358 --> 01:45:28,697
The soldiers are conducting a
search starting with that mountain.

1070
01:45:28,698 --> 01:45:33,159
We'll finish quickly
and come back down soon.

1071
01:45:33,160 --> 01:45:34,160
Very well.

1072
01:45:34,618 --> 01:45:35,618
Let them through.

1073
01:46:32,595 --> 01:46:35,054
Pull out and return to base.

1074
01:46:35,055 --> 01:46:38,893
We gave it what it wanted, so I
suppose it'll wake up at midnight.

1075
01:46:40,103 --> 01:46:45,233
If you can lure it to the yew tree,
I'll buy us as much time as I can.

1076
01:46:45,858 --> 01:46:48,525
It won't take us
long to pull it out.

1077
01:46:48,526 --> 01:46:50,987
Just get us 30 minutes.

1078
01:46:50,988 --> 01:46:53,406
When you pull out
the iron stake...

1079
01:46:56,533 --> 01:46:59,038
make sure to cleanse it
immediately with this horse blood.

1080
01:47:01,665 --> 01:47:02,665
Mr. Kim.

1081
01:47:03,751 --> 01:47:04,918
You're sure that iron stake

1082
01:47:06,585 --> 01:47:07,961
is really there, right?

1083
01:47:11,548 --> 01:47:12,716
I'm absolutely certain.

1084
01:47:21,060 --> 01:47:23,521
Gwang-sim, please look
after Bong-gil tonight.

1085
01:47:24,021 --> 01:47:26,730
If things go wrong,
he'll be in danger.

1086
01:47:48,128 --> 01:47:49,213
Stop staring.

1087
01:47:49,713 --> 01:47:51,256
She said it'll show
up at midnight.

1088
01:48:04,436 --> 01:48:05,436
Mr. Ko.

1089
01:48:06,896 --> 01:48:08,857
Thanks for coming with me.

1090
01:48:08,858 --> 01:48:10,774
"A person alone can be
attacked and defeated,

1091
01:48:10,775 --> 01:48:13,110
but two can stand
back-to-back and conquer."

1092
01:48:13,111 --> 01:48:14,154
"Three are even better,

1093
01:48:14,155 --> 01:48:16,035
for a triple-braided cord
is not easily broken."

1094
01:48:16,573 --> 01:48:18,200
Ecclesiastes 4:12.

1095
01:48:21,035 --> 01:48:22,036
Amen.

1096
01:48:39,305 --> 01:48:40,305
Gwang-sim.

1097
01:48:41,680 --> 01:48:43,726
I hope we won't have to kill it.

1098
01:48:45,185 --> 01:48:47,021
It would be dying in his place.

1099
01:48:49,481 --> 01:48:52,526
Plus, you like fried chicken,
so what's the matter?

1100
01:51:53,746 --> 01:51:55,918
Have you filled your stomach?

1101
01:52:13,685 --> 01:52:14,851
It has to be here.

1102
01:52:26,905 --> 01:52:29,243
Is someone there?

1103
01:52:34,331 --> 01:52:36,625
My mountain is being disturbed.

1104
01:52:41,463 --> 01:52:45,133
Does this mountain
belong to you?

1105
01:52:47,636 --> 01:52:50,848
Indeed, this is my mountain.

1106
01:52:51,640 --> 01:52:54,891
Goddamn old tree god.

1107
01:52:55,893 --> 01:53:00,063
How is it that I do not
hear any guns or bayonets?

1108
01:53:00,775 --> 01:53:02,276
You are mistaken.

1109
01:53:03,986 --> 01:53:05,695
The war ended a long time ago...

1110
01:53:05,696 --> 01:53:06,696
No!

1111
01:53:07,490 --> 01:53:09,906
Our war has not ended yet!

1112
01:53:22,380 --> 01:53:26,633
Why have you come here?

1113
01:53:29,218 --> 01:53:34,724
That fox brought me
here on the battlefield

1114
01:53:34,725 --> 01:53:39,730
instead of the Namsan shrine
when I was kept in Daitoku-ji.

1115
01:53:41,523 --> 01:53:44,650
I assume it was under
Katahito's order.

1116
01:53:44,651 --> 01:53:47,905
Or that of Makoto's.

1117
01:53:55,953 --> 01:53:57,996
This is a quaint land now.

1118
01:53:58,581 --> 01:54:00,751
You do not belong here anymore.

1119
01:54:04,713 --> 01:54:07,380
No, no.

1120
01:54:07,381 --> 01:54:11,177
We must continue heading North.

1121
01:54:11,178 --> 01:54:14,387
- Raise your bayonets and head North!
- And head North!

1122
01:54:14,388 --> 01:54:16,972
- Head North!
- Head North!

1123
01:54:16,973 --> 01:54:20,813
- A brave warrior never retreats.
- A brave warrior never retreats.

1124
01:54:29,238 --> 01:54:30,238
I don't understand.

1125
01:54:30,239 --> 01:54:31,573
There's nothing here.

1126
01:54:36,870 --> 01:54:39,288
As the ruler of this
place, I will ask again.

1127
01:54:40,123 --> 01:54:42,460
Since when have you been here?

1128
01:54:43,543 --> 01:54:45,461
Retain your respect for me!

1129
01:54:46,505 --> 01:54:51,259
I am the embodiment of fear.

1130
01:54:51,260 --> 01:54:52,885
This is my land!

1131
01:54:52,886 --> 01:54:53,925
I will ask again.

1132
01:54:53,926 --> 01:54:55,221
What are you?

1133
01:55:02,480 --> 01:55:03,729
It's not here.

1134
01:55:03,730 --> 01:55:04,773
It's not here!

1135
01:55:07,108 --> 01:55:08,275
There's nothing here.

1136
01:55:08,276 --> 01:55:09,316
You said you were certain!

1137
01:55:17,951 --> 01:55:20,453
It has to be here.

1138
01:55:21,038 --> 01:55:22,708
Remember.

1139
01:55:24,041 --> 01:55:30,882
They took my head at Sekigahara,
but I transcended the mortal form.

1140
01:55:30,883 --> 01:55:33,425
I am the god of the battlefield.

1141
01:55:33,426 --> 01:55:37,848
My undecaying lord, you
are a burning sword!

1142
01:55:38,556 --> 01:55:42,057
38.3417, 128.3189.

1143
01:55:42,058 --> 01:55:44,854
The fox has put a curse on me.

1144
01:55:44,855 --> 01:55:47,566
I must protect this site.

1145
01:56:00,203 --> 01:56:02,996
Do you have someone captive?

1146
01:56:04,875 --> 01:56:08,170
Please free the human
you hold captive.

1147
01:56:09,338 --> 01:56:10,338
Now!

1148
01:56:11,088 --> 01:56:12,341
I beg of you!

1149
01:56:21,766 --> 01:56:23,100
A human.

1150
01:56:24,143 --> 01:56:25,393
Forward.

1151
01:56:26,896 --> 01:56:28,440
Forward.

1152
01:56:29,398 --> 01:56:30,776
Forward.

1153
01:56:32,861 --> 01:56:34,278
Forward.

1154
01:56:44,413 --> 01:56:46,458
Cursed old hag.

1155
01:57:17,906 --> 01:57:18,781
Did you find it?

1156
01:57:18,782 --> 01:57:20,950
- There's nothing there.
- What do you mean?

1157
01:57:20,951 --> 01:57:22,871
We couldn't find anything.
We have to pull out...

1158
01:57:40,343 --> 01:57:41,430
Mr. Kim.

1159
01:57:45,308 --> 01:57:47,268
This can't be.

1160
01:57:48,895 --> 01:57:50,981
It has to be here somewhere.

1161
01:58:00,113 --> 01:58:03,450
38.3417, 128.3189.

1162
01:58:03,451 --> 01:58:06,995
My lord, please return.

1163
01:58:06,996 --> 01:58:10,541
38.3417, 128.3189!

1164
01:58:11,208 --> 01:58:12,501
Kim Sang-duk!

1165
01:58:25,556 --> 01:58:28,266
Mr. Kim! Get out of there!

1166
01:58:41,615 --> 01:58:43,655
Then why is the ghost there?

1167
01:58:43,656 --> 01:58:45,532
He said he's the general
guarding the site.

1168
01:58:45,533 --> 01:58:47,452
That means it's returned
to where it was.

1169
01:58:47,453 --> 01:58:49,831
Have you ever seen a
coffin buried vertically?

1170
01:58:54,001 --> 01:58:55,378
Fire.

1171
01:58:56,295 --> 01:58:59,423
The fire digs into the ground.

1172
01:59:00,466 --> 01:59:01,466
Get out!

1173
01:59:16,900 --> 01:59:18,735
Will you become my servant?

1174
01:59:21,320 --> 01:59:22,781
If not,

1175
01:59:23,781 --> 01:59:25,868
will you offer your liver to me?

1176
01:59:30,328 --> 01:59:34,418
It has been over 500
years since I memorized...

1177
01:59:36,003 --> 01:59:37,921
the scripture written on you.

1178
01:59:41,008 --> 01:59:43,051
The metal driven
into the ground,

1179
01:59:44,593 --> 01:59:46,680
and the fire that guards it.

1180
01:59:47,556 --> 01:59:49,098
Devour...

1181
01:59:50,723 --> 01:59:52,060
the liver, my lord.

1182
01:59:53,310 --> 01:59:55,063
A fresh liver.

1183
02:00:01,903 --> 02:00:03,361
The horse blood!

1184
02:00:17,375 --> 02:00:19,170
The blood of the white horse.

1185
02:00:20,880 --> 02:00:21,965
It's hot.

1186
02:00:27,510 --> 02:00:29,261
Please retreat.

1187
02:00:30,140 --> 02:00:33,810
You cannot have
them find you again.

1188
02:00:37,188 --> 02:00:38,315
It's an anima.

1189
02:00:39,271 --> 02:00:40,900
It comes to be

1190
02:00:41,943 --> 02:00:44,321
when a human or animal soul
evolves with an object.

1191
02:00:46,990 --> 02:00:49,408
Yes, it's the iron.

1192
02:00:51,410 --> 02:00:54,538
You are the burning metal.

1193
02:01:01,213 --> 02:01:03,295
Mr. Kim.

1194
02:01:03,296 --> 02:01:04,296
Pull yourself together!

1195
02:01:04,673 --> 02:01:05,953
Hurry, we have to carry him out.

1196
02:02:05,193 --> 02:02:06,403
Earth...

1197
02:02:08,988 --> 02:02:10,781
and wood.

1198
02:02:11,740 --> 02:02:16,038
Based on the energy of the earth,
fire, water, wood, and metal

1199
02:02:16,538 --> 02:02:18,206
form the four
cardinal directions.

1200
02:02:23,626 --> 02:02:26,090
Fire and water are
opposite poles,

1201
02:02:26,840 --> 02:02:29,718
and so are metal and wood.

1202
02:02:38,560 --> 02:02:39,560
That's it.

1203
02:02:58,621 --> 02:03:00,331
Burning metal.

1204
02:03:02,791 --> 02:03:04,376
The opposite of that...

1205
02:03:05,793 --> 02:03:07,796
is wet wood.

1206
02:03:18,016 --> 02:03:20,393
Water conquers fire...

1207
02:03:28,566 --> 02:03:30,153
and wet wood...

1208
02:03:32,906 --> 02:03:34,531
is tougher than metal.

1209
02:03:50,713 --> 02:03:51,713
Gwang-sim, wait.

1210
02:03:52,590 --> 02:03:53,760
His blood is dark.

1211
02:04:15,863 --> 02:04:18,616
One last blow.

1212
02:05:03,786 --> 02:05:05,165
Are you okay, Bong-gil?

1213
02:05:12,755 --> 02:05:13,671
Mr. Kim.

1214
02:05:13,672 --> 02:05:15,465
What do we do?

1215
02:05:15,466 --> 02:05:17,010
- Mr. Kim.
- What do we do?

1216
02:05:17,718 --> 02:05:19,051
What do we...

1217
02:05:21,473 --> 02:05:22,765
I'm dying.

1218
02:05:24,056 --> 02:05:26,270
Thankfully, it's
not that painful.

1219
02:05:26,810 --> 02:05:28,520
Hey, Kim Sang-duk!

1220
02:05:28,521 --> 02:05:30,147
Don't die on me!

1221
02:05:30,148 --> 02:05:32,690
I've always lived
so close to death.

1222
02:05:35,528 --> 02:05:40,408
I guess it's just my turn now.

1223
02:05:43,120 --> 02:05:45,871
Dying is about
returning to earth.

1224
02:05:48,000 --> 02:05:49,833
I'll leave in comfort...

1225
02:05:51,795 --> 02:05:55,587
Wait, my daughter's wedding...

1226
02:05:55,588 --> 02:05:58,550
Grant him the courage
to overcome the surgery.

1227
02:05:58,551 --> 02:06:01,220
Lord, please envelope him
with your precious blood.

1228
02:06:11,188 --> 02:06:15,401
Several people died, and a few
others were injured over a few days.

1229
02:06:15,901 --> 02:06:18,070
Upon inspection of
security cameras...

1230
02:06:18,071 --> 02:06:23,741
After several days of searching,
the soldiers captured a wild bear,

1231
02:06:25,036 --> 02:06:29,540
and the media is on an ongoing debate
on whether to kill this innocent bear.

1232
02:06:31,625 --> 02:06:34,503
For the safety of
the villagers...

1233
02:06:36,340 --> 02:06:37,340
He's awake.

1234
02:06:39,006 --> 02:06:40,008
Mr. Kim.

1235
02:06:40,926 --> 02:06:43,095
Are you awake?

1236
02:06:43,096 --> 02:06:47,516
Thankfully, Mr. Kim's recovery
was rapid despite his age.

1237
02:06:49,016 --> 02:06:50,603
As for Bong-gil,

1238
02:06:51,521 --> 02:06:52,396
well...

1239
02:06:52,397 --> 02:06:54,190
Speak of the devil.

1240
02:06:54,858 --> 02:06:56,610
Seriously?

1241
02:06:57,568 --> 02:06:58,694
This is our meal.

1242
02:06:58,695 --> 02:07:00,112
How could you eat without me?

1243
02:07:00,113 --> 02:07:02,073
- Here, eat.
- Give me a slice.

1244
02:07:14,836 --> 02:07:16,837
Is this a diner?

1245
02:07:16,838 --> 02:07:19,005
Why are you all
always eating here?

1246
02:07:19,006 --> 02:07:20,922
You think I'm eating
because I want to?

1247
02:07:20,923 --> 02:07:23,135
I'm stuffing myself
because it's so good.

1248
02:07:23,136 --> 02:07:24,385
It's good.

1249
02:07:24,386 --> 02:07:27,680
You have to fast, so
someone's got to eat these.

1250
02:07:28,433 --> 02:07:30,143
Think of it as a diet.

1251
02:07:37,858 --> 02:07:41,988
Winter passed and we all
went back to our lives...

1252
02:07:44,406 --> 02:07:45,866
as if nothing had happened.

1253
02:08:10,433 --> 02:08:15,520
- While I live briefly in this world,
- While I live briefly in this world,

1254
02:08:15,521 --> 02:08:20,485
- Always singing praises
- Always singing praises

1255
02:08:21,026 --> 02:08:26,574
- When the day fades away,
- When the day fades away,

1256
02:08:26,575 --> 02:08:31,954
- I shall proceed in glory
- I shall proceed in glory

1257
02:08:31,955 --> 02:08:33,664
- Through the gate of heaven...
- Through the gate of heaven...

1258
02:08:33,665 --> 02:08:36,917
I told you it has to
face the West, did I not?

1259
02:08:36,918 --> 02:08:39,921
Facing the South isn't
always a good thing.

1260
02:08:40,630 --> 02:08:42,506
What should we do then?

1261
02:08:52,516 --> 02:08:55,561
The bride and groom will
now bow to each other.

1262
02:08:56,605 --> 02:08:58,523
Bride and groom, please bow.

1263
02:09:09,241 --> 02:09:13,954
Family members, please step
forward for a group picture.

1264
02:09:13,955 --> 02:09:15,415
Hey, Mr. Ko.

1265
02:09:16,625 --> 02:09:17,958
Get over here.

1266
02:09:19,001 --> 02:09:21,878
It's a family photo. Why
would we be included?

1267
02:09:24,340 --> 02:09:26,257
Let's just join for one photo.

1268
02:09:26,258 --> 02:09:27,924
Let's just take one.

1269
02:09:27,925 --> 02:09:29,427
- We're practically family.
- Let's go.

1270
02:09:29,428 --> 02:09:31,388
But it's a family photo.

1271
02:09:34,516 --> 02:09:37,809
The tall gentleman in the
middle, please take a step up.

1272
02:09:37,810 --> 02:09:41,063
The gentleman in glasses,
please come closer.

1273
02:09:42,275 --> 02:09:43,275
Make sure you don't...

1274
02:09:43,276 --> 02:09:46,529
How do we have bellies
of the same size?

1275
02:09:46,530 --> 02:09:47,862
Goodness.

1276
02:09:47,863 --> 02:09:49,281
Here we go.

1277
02:09:50,700 --> 02:09:52,493
Father of the bride,
please look forward.

1278
02:09:53,578 --> 02:09:55,705
Looking great, everyone.

1279
02:09:56,623 --> 02:09:58,080
Let's all smile, all right?

1280
02:09:58,915 --> 02:10:02,085
One, two, three.
