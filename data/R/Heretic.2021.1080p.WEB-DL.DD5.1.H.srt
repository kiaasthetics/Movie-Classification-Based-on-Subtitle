1
00:02:32,553 --> 00:02:35,188
Hi, my name is Rachel.

2
00:02:35,322 --> 00:02:40,160
I was in an accident down the
road and I saw your house and,

3
00:02:41,194 --> 00:02:42,295
thank God you're home.

4
00:02:42,429 --> 00:02:43,931
Can I come in?

5
00:03:01,149 --> 00:03:02,784
Thanks.

6
00:03:05,787 --> 00:03:07,287
Oh, sorry.

7
00:03:07,421 --> 00:03:09,057
I forgot to ask you your name.

8
00:03:09,189 --> 00:03:11,191
Oh, uh, Hannah.

9
00:03:11,324 --> 00:03:13,695
-That's pretty.
-Thanks.

10
00:03:14,562 --> 00:03:18,032
Um, so not many people take

11
00:03:18,166 --> 00:03:21,602
that road anymore, especially
not in this weather.

12
00:03:21,736 --> 00:03:24,772
Yeah, it's my dad's
50th birthday tomorrow

13
00:03:24,906 --> 00:03:28,076
and I thought I would come a
little early to surprise him.

14
00:03:28,208 --> 00:03:29,911
The freeway was all jammed up

15
00:03:30,044 --> 00:03:32,245
and I thought I
could cut through it

16
00:03:32,379 --> 00:03:34,716
if I just went
over the mountain.

17
00:03:34,849 --> 00:03:36,818
Brilliant, right?

18
00:03:36,951 --> 00:03:41,823
Well, uh, you're welcome to
stay here as long as you need.

19
00:03:41,956 --> 00:03:44,559
God knows I could
use the company.

20
00:03:44,692 --> 00:03:46,794
Seems like it.

21
00:03:46,928 --> 00:03:50,464
So what are you
doing over there?

22
00:03:52,033 --> 00:03:55,002
Oh, um, nothing.

23
00:03:55,136 --> 00:03:56,436
It's none of my business.

24
00:03:56,571 --> 00:03:59,640
No it's, it's fine I'm,

25
00:04:03,878 --> 00:04:09,083
I'm trying to communicate
and call upon spirits.

26
00:04:09,217 --> 00:04:12,787
Just, you know, trying to
get a better understanding

27
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:18,559
of life, death, just venturing
out into the unknown.

28
00:04:20,528 --> 00:04:22,163
That's cool.

29
00:04:24,532 --> 00:04:26,501
How do you play?

30
00:04:35,275 --> 00:04:36,677
What next?

31
00:04:38,411 --> 00:04:40,447
We could ask three questions.

32
00:04:40,581 --> 00:04:42,282
You go first.

33
00:04:42,884 --> 00:04:44,451
Okay.

34
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:50,892
Are there any spirits
here with us tonight?

35
00:04:56,531 --> 00:04:57,965
Is that a yes?

36
00:04:59,466 --> 00:05:01,068
She's a mother figure.

37
00:05:02,435 --> 00:05:04,205
It's what the card suggests.

38
00:05:04,337 --> 00:05:05,940
Someone you know?

39
00:05:10,377 --> 00:05:13,781
-Ask her something.
-Okay.

40
00:05:13,915 --> 00:05:17,484
Um, what did...

41
00:05:18,519 --> 00:05:21,421
my mother want to tell me
before she died?

42
00:05:26,093 --> 00:05:32,365
In this card she's surrounded
by swords, afraid to move.

43
00:05:33,134 --> 00:05:34,068
She's blind.

44
00:05:34,202 --> 00:05:36,436
She can't see a way forward.

45
00:05:38,338 --> 00:05:40,274
She's hopeless.

46
00:05:40,407 --> 00:05:45,012
Sort of like being trapped
by your own circumstances?

47
00:05:45,146 --> 00:05:47,215
Yeah, maybe.

48
00:05:51,953 --> 00:05:53,321
One more.

49
00:05:53,453 --> 00:05:55,355
Make it a good one.

50
00:05:55,488 --> 00:05:56,991
Okay,

51
00:06:01,494 --> 00:06:03,931
Will I see you again?

52
00:06:08,836 --> 00:06:10,738
The dog and the wolf.

53
00:06:11,438 --> 00:06:13,473
Fear and apprehension.

54
00:06:13,608 --> 00:06:16,544
Follow the path
to move past them.

55
00:06:16,677 --> 00:06:18,546
Where does it lead?

56
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:21,015
The unknown.

57
00:06:23,784 --> 00:06:26,520
Maybe that's where
you'll find her.

58
00:06:27,255 --> 00:06:28,756
Yeah.

59
00:06:31,158 --> 00:06:31,959
This is fun.

60
00:06:32,093 --> 00:06:34,427
Yeah.

61
00:06:35,428 --> 00:06:36,898
Your turn.

62
00:06:40,701 --> 00:06:42,603
I wanna know,

63
00:06:45,606 --> 00:06:47,174
how will I die?

64
00:06:48,042 --> 00:06:48,943
What?

65
00:06:49,076 --> 00:06:51,012
No, don't ask that.

66
00:06:53,347 --> 00:06:54,382
Holy shit.

67
00:06:54,515 --> 00:06:57,318
It's not meant to be literal.

68
00:06:57,450 --> 00:07:01,255
This person is
stuck, so to speak.

69
00:07:01,389 --> 00:07:03,658
In a dire situation.

70
00:07:03,791 --> 00:07:05,593
They don't see a way out.

71
00:07:07,427 --> 00:07:08,428
We could stop.

72
00:07:08,562 --> 00:07:10,598
No, no let's keep going.

73
00:07:10,731 --> 00:07:13,000
I have two more.

74
00:07:13,567 --> 00:07:15,069
Okay.

75
00:07:15,202 --> 00:07:16,971
Hmm, let's see.

76
00:07:17,104 --> 00:07:19,907
So when I die,

77
00:07:23,210 --> 00:07:24,578
will I be alone?

78
00:07:26,580 --> 00:07:28,149
Flip the card.

79
00:07:34,855 --> 00:07:36,824
Okay, what does that mean?

80
00:07:38,192 --> 00:07:40,194
It represents loss.

81
00:07:40,328 --> 00:07:45,533
Something is gone, but
some of it still remains.

82
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:47,702
Spooky.

83
00:07:48,135 --> 00:07:49,236
Yeah.

84
00:07:52,540 --> 00:07:53,908
When did she die?

85
00:07:54,041 --> 00:07:55,076
What?

86
00:07:55,209 --> 00:07:56,711
Your mother.

87
00:07:59,313 --> 00:08:01,215
Oh, um,

88
00:08:05,953 --> 00:08:07,722
when I was very young.

89
00:08:10,391 --> 00:08:11,859
Cancer.

90
00:08:15,963 --> 00:08:21,235
She was my everything.

91
00:08:21,369 --> 00:08:24,538
And I, I couldn't...

92
00:08:26,140 --> 00:08:29,543
I couldn't stand
to see her like that.

93
00:08:30,444 --> 00:08:33,881
Let alone be in a room with her.

94
00:08:36,951 --> 00:08:39,820
You know,
when you're a kid,

95
00:08:39,954 --> 00:08:42,790
you don't understand
permanence.

96
00:08:46,827 --> 00:08:51,132
And then one day
she was just...

97
00:08:52,266 --> 00:08:53,768
gone.

98
00:08:54,702 --> 00:08:56,505
Did you get to say goodbye?

99
00:08:56,637 --> 00:08:58,572
No.

100
00:08:59,273 --> 00:09:00,741
I'm sorry.

101
00:09:04,612 --> 00:09:08,315
It's okay.

102
00:09:12,653 --> 00:09:14,055
My father.

103
00:09:16,490 --> 00:09:20,694
We haven't been on speaking
terms for a while now.

104
00:09:21,896 --> 00:09:24,965
He's been trying,
but I've just been

105
00:09:25,099 --> 00:09:28,035
this stubborn little shit.

106
00:09:28,169 --> 00:09:30,905
And I actually thought
the storm was some kind

107
00:09:31,038 --> 00:09:34,075
of sign telling me to turn back.

108
00:09:35,743 --> 00:09:38,946
But I'm glad it brought me here.

109
00:09:41,148 --> 00:09:42,650
Me too.

110
00:09:47,321 --> 00:09:48,823
Last card.

111
00:09:50,291 --> 00:09:51,992
Okay.

112
00:09:55,096 --> 00:09:57,064
Do you know what you wanna ask?

113
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:00,901
No idea.

114
00:10:03,604 --> 00:10:07,708
Okay, um, I wanna know...

115
00:10:18,652 --> 00:10:20,087
When you're dead...

116
00:10:22,389 --> 00:10:24,024
how do you know?

117
00:14:59,066 --> 00:15:00,367
Rachel?

118
00:15:04,371 --> 00:15:06,473
I'm sorry you're back here.

119
00:15:07,842 --> 00:15:10,944
It's probably because
we left things unfinished.

120
00:15:19,219 --> 00:15:21,623
You were in an accident.

121
00:15:22,757 --> 00:15:24,491
It was raining.

122
00:15:26,126 --> 00:15:30,364
You lost control somehow and
drove off the side of a cliff.

123
00:15:32,567 --> 00:15:34,569
You died.

124
00:15:34,702 --> 00:15:37,906
It was eight weeks
before you were found.

125
00:15:38,038 --> 00:15:42,677
Your body was buried but...
you've been on this mountain

126
00:15:42,811 --> 00:15:45,547
for 10 years.

127
00:15:50,284 --> 00:15:52,520
Do you understand
what I'm saying?

128
00:15:55,857 --> 00:15:57,625
Light.

129
00:16:04,965 --> 00:16:06,433
Light.

130
00:16:17,411 --> 00:16:21,048
I know who you are.

131
00:16:21,883 --> 00:16:24,084
I know what you want.

132
00:16:26,286 --> 00:16:29,189
This was your mother's house.

133
00:16:29,323 --> 00:16:32,125
Here, you feel closer to her.

134
00:16:33,795 --> 00:16:35,395
Closer to me.

135
00:16:36,564 --> 00:16:38,165
Where are you?

136
00:16:39,534 --> 00:16:42,737
Close your eyes.

137
00:16:48,208 --> 00:16:50,110
Can you see me?

138
00:16:51,679 --> 00:16:53,213
Everywhere.

139
00:16:54,883 --> 00:16:56,684
Surrounding you.

140
00:16:58,252 --> 00:16:59,988
How does it feel?

141
00:17:00,788 --> 00:17:03,791
Leave her alone, goddammit!

142
00:17:24,579 --> 00:17:26,179
Rachel?

143
00:17:33,521 --> 00:17:34,822
Wait.

144
00:18:05,987 --> 00:18:08,355
I know who you are too.

145
00:18:09,657 --> 00:18:12,927
Everyone
knows who I am.

146
00:18:13,061 --> 00:18:17,464
And with each passing
moment, I grow closer.

147
00:18:19,499 --> 00:18:22,003
I can see that you're angry.

148
00:18:22,135 --> 00:18:24,539
You have questions.

149
00:18:24,672 --> 00:18:28,576
Sadly, the answer
is always the same.

150
00:18:30,678 --> 00:18:34,849
If you must ask, then
you know where to go.

151
00:18:37,317 --> 00:18:38,820
Go!

152
00:20:00,535 --> 00:20:02,937
I know who you are too.

153
00:20:14,716 --> 00:20:17,685
I don't have any questions.

154
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:25,893
I just wanted you to see me so
that you know I'm not afraid.

155
00:22:55,243 --> 00:22:57,945
-Hello?
-Hannah?

156
00:22:58,079 --> 00:23:01,182
-Ethan?
-I'm sorry I didn't know

157
00:23:01,315 --> 00:23:03,017
who else to call.

158
00:23:03,150 --> 00:23:06,754
-What's wrong?
-My father, he's dead.

159
00:23:54,168 --> 00:23:55,636
Hello?

160
00:23:57,338 --> 00:23:59,106
Hannah?

161
00:24:01,342 --> 00:24:02,977
Hi.

162
00:24:18,392 --> 00:24:20,061
It's good to see you.

163
00:24:21,461 --> 00:24:22,930
Is it?

164
00:24:24,298 --> 00:24:26,033
Hannah.

165
00:24:29,437 --> 00:24:30,938
Hello, Ruth.

166
00:24:31,872 --> 00:24:33,674
Thank you for coming.

167
00:24:34,442 --> 00:24:35,943
Of course.

168
00:24:37,611 --> 00:24:41,983
Ethan, do you mind if I have
a word alone with Hannah?

169
00:25:02,269 --> 00:25:03,871
I won't bite.

170
00:25:18,652 --> 00:25:21,355
Do you know what
happened to my husband?

171
00:25:21,489 --> 00:25:22,957
Did Ethan tell you?

172
00:25:23,624 --> 00:25:25,292
Just that he passed.

173
00:25:25,826 --> 00:25:26,827
Self-inflicted.

174
00:25:26,961 --> 00:25:28,596
He put a gun in his mouth.

175
00:25:28,729 --> 00:25:30,798
Blew his fucking brains out.

176
00:25:36,670 --> 00:25:38,139
Didn't leave a note.

177
00:25:38,272 --> 00:25:40,975
No indication that
he would do such a thing.

178
00:25:43,711 --> 00:25:46,247
Sometimes there's
no explanation.

179
00:25:57,458 --> 00:25:58,959
Are you okay?

180
00:26:01,562 --> 00:26:02,997
I still see him.

181
00:26:05,433 --> 00:26:06,467
What do you mean?

182
00:26:06,600 --> 00:26:08,002
My husband.

183
00:26:09,470 --> 00:26:11,705
His presence.

184
00:26:12,541 --> 00:26:13,874
It lingers.

185
00:26:15,609 --> 00:26:17,812
Along with something else.

186
00:26:23,617 --> 00:26:26,253
I'd like to show you something.

187
00:27:00,488 --> 00:27:02,156
The coroner took him away.

188
00:27:03,424 --> 00:27:04,925
Ethan left.

189
00:27:06,093 --> 00:27:10,998
He wanted me to go to
a hotel but... I stayed.

190
00:27:12,166 --> 00:27:13,767
This is my home.

191
00:27:15,236 --> 00:27:20,975
I couldn't sleep so
I wandered the house.

192
00:27:22,042 --> 00:27:25,045
And then I found
myself in this room.

193
00:27:25,946 --> 00:27:28,282
And that's when I saw him.

194
00:27:28,415 --> 00:27:29,984
Over there in the corner.

195
00:27:37,191 --> 00:27:39,894
He was just standing there.

196
00:27:40,661 --> 00:27:42,229
Mouth agape.

197
00:27:43,497 --> 00:27:45,733
Like he was trying to speak.

198
00:27:45,866 --> 00:27:47,935
Trying to tell me something.

199
00:27:52,306 --> 00:27:53,774
Hannah?

200
00:27:57,344 --> 00:28:00,014
What do you think
he was trying to say?

201
00:28:00,615 --> 00:28:01,949
I wouldn't know.

202
00:28:04,084 --> 00:28:06,020
I'd like you to ask him.

203
00:28:07,121 --> 00:28:08,557
I don't think I can help you.

204
00:28:08,689 --> 00:28:10,024
Why not?

205
00:28:10,157 --> 00:28:11,992
You've communicated
before, haven't you?

206
00:28:12,126 --> 00:28:12,860
Yeah.

207
00:28:12,993 --> 00:28:14,495
And then my house burned down.

208
00:28:14,629 --> 00:28:16,096
I know.

209
00:28:16,230 --> 00:28:19,767
I heard the rumors of what
you were doing up there.

210
00:28:23,304 --> 00:28:26,941
Why else do you think
I asked Ethan to call you?

211
00:28:29,678 --> 00:28:31,145
You know what?

212
00:28:32,246 --> 00:28:34,481
I just don't want
to get involved.

213
00:28:35,716 --> 00:28:37,484
So you're afraid.

214
00:28:39,320 --> 00:28:41,922
I didn't think
you were a coward.

215
00:28:43,357 --> 00:28:45,560
The dead want nothing
to do with us.

216
00:28:45,694 --> 00:28:47,194
You're wrong.

217
00:28:52,099 --> 00:28:54,969
You know what?
It was a mistake coming here.

218
00:28:55,970 --> 00:28:57,805
We're not done!

219
00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:00,207
Don't ever call me again.

220
00:29:06,615 --> 00:29:07,881
Hannah, wait!

221
00:29:08,015 --> 00:29:09,651
-Can we talk?
-I have to go.

222
00:29:09,783 --> 00:29:11,318
Please!

223
00:29:14,989 --> 00:29:18,727
Look, I've missed you.

224
00:29:18,859 --> 00:29:20,995
And I wanted to see you again.

225
00:29:22,530 --> 00:29:26,967
I just, I hope you
take care of yourself.

226
00:29:35,276 --> 00:29:36,910
We can't
have him here anymore.

227
00:29:37,044 --> 00:29:38,513
He just sits there with
the car running all day.

228
00:29:38,647 --> 00:29:39,913
I understand.

229
00:29:40,047 --> 00:29:41,716
I mean, there are
kids running around.

230
00:29:41,849 --> 00:29:43,217
I understand.

231
00:29:53,927 --> 00:29:55,563
Fuck!

232
00:30:00,702 --> 00:30:01,670
Dad.

233
00:30:01,802 --> 00:30:03,304
Wake up.

234
00:30:03,437 --> 00:30:04,639
Dad.

235
00:30:04,773 --> 00:30:06,340
Dad, come on.

236
00:30:07,609 --> 00:30:08,510
Dad.

237
00:30:08,643 --> 00:30:10,944
Come on, we have to go.

238
00:30:11,646 --> 00:30:12,446
No!

239
00:30:12,580 --> 00:30:13,548
-No!
-Dad!

240
00:30:13,682 --> 00:30:15,416
Let's go.
Get up!

241
00:30:15,550 --> 00:30:18,218
-No!
-Get up!

242
00:30:18,352 --> 00:30:19,820
Get up!

243
00:30:20,755 --> 00:30:23,424
Come on, Dad.
Let's go.

244
00:30:23,558 --> 00:30:25,760
- Oh my God.
- Do you need any help?

245
00:30:25,893 --> 00:30:27,861
What do you think?

246
00:31:04,465 --> 00:31:06,133
There you are.

247
00:31:06,934 --> 00:31:08,570
What are you thinking about?

248
00:31:09,303 --> 00:31:11,438
You don't like her.

249
00:31:12,272 --> 00:31:13,974
You never liked her.

250
00:31:14,108 --> 00:31:16,511
When has that ever
mattered to you?

251
00:31:18,580 --> 00:31:19,980
But you need her.

252
00:31:20,515 --> 00:31:22,249
We need her.

253
00:31:24,952 --> 00:31:27,454
Talk to me.

254
00:31:27,589 --> 00:31:29,256
I'm tired.

255
00:31:29,390 --> 00:31:32,827
And nothing seems to
make any sense anymore.

256
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:35,764
That's because
he wanted to talk to us.

257
00:31:43,003 --> 00:31:46,039
I don't need you to believe me.

258
00:31:51,211 --> 00:31:53,080
I'll talk to her.

259
00:31:56,116 --> 00:31:57,418
Good boy.

260
00:33:01,583 --> 00:33:03,283
I have
to get back soon.

261
00:33:03,417 --> 00:33:06,420
I only came here to
collect some clothes.

262
00:33:06,554 --> 00:33:08,923
Do you want
me to come with you?

263
00:33:09,056 --> 00:33:09,891
No.

264
00:33:10,023 --> 00:33:11,992
I'm used to it.

265
00:33:12,125 --> 00:33:14,261
You can stay if you want.

266
00:33:17,030 --> 00:33:20,067
No, I should probably get going.

267
00:33:20,200 --> 00:33:22,770
Got to meet with dad's
lawyers in the morning.

268
00:33:23,571 --> 00:33:24,772
What for?

269
00:33:24,906 --> 00:33:27,040
Nothing was in order.

270
00:33:27,174 --> 00:33:29,076
He left us a fucking
mess to clean up

271
00:33:29,209 --> 00:33:32,145
and my mom can't
handle it on her own.

272
00:33:32,279 --> 00:33:34,582
I'm sorry she brought
you into this.

273
00:33:34,716 --> 00:33:36,250
It's okay.

274
00:33:36,383 --> 00:33:39,453
You know she wants
you to do that sÃ©ance thing?

275
00:33:40,287 --> 00:33:42,456
-I won't.
-I know.

276
00:33:43,691 --> 00:33:46,059
But she's not
going to let it go.

277
00:33:46,828 --> 00:33:48,897
I'm worried about her.

278
00:33:49,029 --> 00:33:52,432
You know she's just
looking for answers, right?

279
00:33:53,033 --> 00:33:54,468
She misses him.

280
00:33:56,103 --> 00:33:57,672
She's not angry.

281
00:34:13,821 --> 00:34:17,291
I know there's something about
him she's not telling me.

282
00:34:17,424 --> 00:34:19,393
So you don't know why he did it?

283
00:34:19,527 --> 00:34:20,929
No.

284
00:34:21,061 --> 00:34:23,397
And I don't know what
difference it would make.

285
00:34:23,531 --> 00:34:25,098
There's nothing anyone could say

286
00:34:25,232 --> 00:34:27,200
that could make us understand.

287
00:34:36,044 --> 00:34:38,478
Can I ask you something?

288
00:34:38,613 --> 00:34:40,080
Okay.

289
00:34:40,213 --> 00:34:42,817
Three years ago I get a call.

290
00:34:42,951 --> 00:34:45,920
You say you're leaving and
I can't see you anymore.

291
00:34:46,054 --> 00:34:49,256
Then I find out some old
house your family owns burns

292
00:34:49,389 --> 00:34:52,426
to the ground and I
don't know where you are.

293
00:34:54,094 --> 00:34:55,395
Where'd you go?

294
00:35:12,547 --> 00:35:14,414
I left the country.

295
00:35:15,650 --> 00:35:18,620
I thought there was
something for me to find.

296
00:35:19,621 --> 00:35:21,723
I didn't mean to hurt you.

297
00:35:23,958 --> 00:35:25,459
I just...

298
00:35:27,962 --> 00:35:30,330
needed to
do it on my own.

299
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:35,135
Did you find what
you were looking for?

300
00:35:38,539 --> 00:35:39,841
No.

301
00:39:39,580 --> 00:39:41,816
Wake up.

302
00:39:42,283 --> 00:39:43,751
Wake up.

303
00:39:44,352 --> 00:39:45,219
Hey.

304
00:39:45,353 --> 00:39:47,420
Here's some water.

305
00:39:47,555 --> 00:39:49,090
Water.

306
00:40:09,409 --> 00:40:11,178
Where are my clothes?

307
00:40:12,513 --> 00:40:14,181
You pissed yourself.

308
00:40:19,854 --> 00:40:22,757
I have clean clothes
in the bathroom for you.

309
00:40:46,881 --> 00:40:49,016
What's wrong with your boat?

310
00:40:49,150 --> 00:40:50,518
What?

311
00:40:50,651 --> 00:40:53,988
They said you've been sleeping
in your car during the day.

312
00:40:54,121 --> 00:40:58,225
- Who said?
- It doesn't matter.

313
00:41:06,167 --> 00:41:08,269
The A/C is broken.

314
00:41:08,402 --> 00:41:10,037
It's too hot to sleep.

315
00:41:10,171 --> 00:41:13,908
Well, maybe they just um,
don't want you to drive off.

316
00:41:14,575 --> 00:41:16,043
From the back seat?

317
00:41:21,182 --> 00:41:22,883
I took 'em all out.

318
00:41:24,484 --> 00:41:27,989
Fuck!

319
00:41:29,090 --> 00:41:30,524
I'm sorry.

320
00:41:31,759 --> 00:41:33,627
It's fine.

321
00:41:40,468 --> 00:41:41,902
This is bullshit.

322
00:41:48,275 --> 00:41:50,244
Where are my fucking keys?

323
00:41:50,378 --> 00:41:52,246
I have your keys.

324
00:41:57,351 --> 00:41:58,853
Hand them over.

325
00:42:02,223 --> 00:42:05,493
I haven't done
anything illegal here.

326
00:42:05,626 --> 00:42:08,162
I mean this is all
a misunderstanding.

327
00:42:08,295 --> 00:42:09,797
I have a guy
coming to fix the A/C

328
00:42:09,930 --> 00:42:11,999
so it'll sort itself out.

329
00:42:20,408 --> 00:42:21,809
Thank you.

330
00:42:22,777 --> 00:42:24,111
Do you want help?

331
00:42:25,479 --> 00:42:27,348
Oh, fuck off.

332
00:42:27,481 --> 00:42:29,683
-Dad.
-What?

333
00:42:34,321 --> 00:42:37,091
Just leave me alone, okay?

334
00:42:40,327 --> 00:42:43,197
They should have never
fucking called you.

335
00:43:55,069 --> 00:43:56,370
Hannah.

336
00:43:57,338 --> 00:43:58,139
Welcome back.

337
00:43:58,272 --> 00:44:00,074
I'll help you.

338
00:44:02,176 --> 00:44:03,477
You ready?

339
00:45:12,846 --> 00:45:14,815
It'll be okay.

340
00:45:23,057 --> 00:45:24,792
Take my hand.

341
00:45:43,444 --> 00:45:44,912
Okay.

342
00:45:50,317 --> 00:45:55,422
Once we initiate contact, none
of us can leave this table.

343
00:45:56,323 --> 00:45:58,826
Not until I say it's ended.

344
00:45:59,561 --> 00:46:01,128
Is that understood?

345
00:46:01,262 --> 00:46:02,796
Yes.

346
00:46:05,634 --> 00:46:07,201
Okay.

347
00:46:11,805 --> 00:46:14,241
I want you to think of a memory.

348
00:46:15,577 --> 00:46:16,944
A good memory.

349
00:46:17,646 --> 00:46:20,147
One that involves him.

350
00:46:20,281 --> 00:46:24,785
And I want you to close
your eyes and just hold it.

351
00:46:29,890 --> 00:46:32,661
We're here to speak with Robert.

352
00:46:32,793 --> 00:46:37,197
Your wife and son wish
to speak with you tonight.

353
00:46:37,331 --> 00:46:41,302
When you are ready, we ask
that you ring the bell

354
00:46:41,435 --> 00:46:44,204
to let us know
that you are here.

355
00:47:52,439 --> 00:47:54,509
He's here.

356
00:47:55,610 --> 00:47:57,277
He's here, I knew it.

357
00:48:00,080 --> 00:48:03,585
Robert, is that you?

358
00:48:11,992 --> 00:48:12,993
Who's doing that?

359
00:48:13,127 --> 00:48:15,062
Shh, shh, shh.

360
00:48:15,963 --> 00:48:17,931
He's here, he's here.

361
00:48:18,065 --> 00:48:19,601
Mom, stop.

362
00:48:20,167 --> 00:48:21,101
He's here.

363
00:48:21,235 --> 00:48:23,437
What are you doing?

364
00:48:23,571 --> 00:48:24,606
I knew it.

365
00:48:24,739 --> 00:48:26,508
Why did you leave me, Robert?

366
00:48:26,641 --> 00:48:28,142
Why did you do it?

367
00:48:28,275 --> 00:48:29,943
Why did you leave me?

368
00:48:40,655 --> 00:48:42,524
This is bullshit!

369
00:48:46,126 --> 00:48:48,962
Robert, is there
anything that you want

370
00:48:49,096 --> 00:48:50,632
to tell your family?

371
00:48:50,765 --> 00:48:51,900
Stop!

372
00:48:52,032 --> 00:48:54,201
Ethan, talk to your father.

373
00:48:54,334 --> 00:48:56,504
I have nothing to say to him!

374
00:49:40,548 --> 00:49:41,749
Ethan!

375
00:49:54,696 --> 00:49:55,563
What did you do to him?

376
00:49:55,697 --> 00:49:56,598
No, no, no!

377
00:49:56,731 --> 00:49:58,499
Don't touch him.

378
00:49:59,801 --> 00:50:01,368
You make the call.

379
00:50:02,202 --> 00:50:04,104
The time is near.

380
00:50:05,974 --> 00:50:07,609
Snow falls.

381
00:50:08,408 --> 00:50:11,713
You walk to Loma Street Bridge.

382
00:50:13,213 --> 00:50:14,481
Cold.

383
00:50:15,583 --> 00:50:20,020
You see her standing
at the other end.

384
00:50:21,689 --> 00:50:23,658
So pretty.

385
00:50:24,592 --> 00:50:26,260
So young.

386
00:50:28,362 --> 00:50:30,230
She's not scared.

387
00:50:35,402 --> 00:50:37,437
I'm going to kill her now.

388
00:50:40,875 --> 00:50:43,043
Ethan!

389
00:50:44,512 --> 00:50:46,046
Ethan.

390
00:50:47,047 --> 00:50:48,683
He's still breathing.

391
00:50:48,816 --> 00:50:50,384
He's going to be okay.

392
00:50:53,153 --> 00:50:54,388
Ruth.

393
00:50:54,522 --> 00:50:55,823
Ruth?

394
00:50:56,691 --> 00:50:58,526
911.

395
00:50:58,660 --> 00:50:59,359
Hi.

396
00:50:59,493 --> 00:51:01,829
I have an emergency.

397
00:51:42,502 --> 00:51:44,739
What are you doing?

398
00:51:48,810 --> 00:51:50,612
It's all over.

399
00:51:53,447 --> 00:51:55,415
I realize now he was trying
to warn me about her.

400
00:52:00,822 --> 00:52:02,824
Come downstairs with me.

401
00:52:06,694 --> 00:52:08,428
I can't do that.

402
00:52:12,366 --> 00:52:14,569
When did you know?

403
00:52:22,543 --> 00:52:24,879
You don't understand.

404
00:52:25,680 --> 00:52:27,180
I do.

405
00:52:28,549 --> 00:52:31,619
A girl was murdered and
your husband killed her.

406
00:52:40,628 --> 00:52:44,832
Robert, he always strayed.

407
00:52:46,466 --> 00:52:47,869
I allowed it.

408
00:52:49,469 --> 00:52:50,872
It was our secret.

409
00:52:54,876 --> 00:52:57,612
Then one day one of
his whores called.

410
00:52:58,445 --> 00:53:01,082
Demanding money to stay quiet.

411
00:53:03,885 --> 00:53:07,387
I told him I would handle
it as I always did.

412
00:54:31,139 --> 00:54:32,907
Ruled a suicide.

413
00:54:37,245 --> 00:54:39,013
As easy as that.

414
00:54:43,483 --> 00:54:46,554
It was later I found
out she was pregnant.

415
00:54:57,632 --> 00:55:01,002
Things were quiet
for a long time.

416
00:55:02,502 --> 00:55:04,839
But our sins never go away.

417
00:55:05,973 --> 00:55:07,708
They come back.

418
00:55:07,842 --> 00:55:10,545
Because they want us to repent.

419
00:55:10,678 --> 00:55:14,481
Listen, your son
needs you, okay?

420
00:55:15,583 --> 00:55:17,484
So just come downstairs.

421
00:55:18,152 --> 00:55:19,620
Please?

422
00:58:20,568 --> 00:58:22,036
Hannah?

423
00:58:23,204 --> 00:58:24,939
Did you hear me?

424
00:58:27,208 --> 00:58:28,509
No.

425
00:58:28,642 --> 00:58:31,045
I asked if you knew
where you were.

426
00:58:38,185 --> 00:58:39,453
The hospital?

427
00:58:39,587 --> 00:58:40,421
That's right.

428
00:58:40,554 --> 00:58:42,156
I'm Dr. Brenner.

429
00:58:42,289 --> 00:58:45,493
You've been in our care
for three weeks now.

430
00:58:45,626 --> 00:58:47,261
How are you feeling?

431
00:58:49,030 --> 00:58:49,964
Okay.

432
00:58:50,097 --> 00:58:51,198
Good.

433
00:58:51,332 --> 00:58:54,935
I need you to listen for a bit.
Is that okay?

434
00:58:55,069 --> 00:58:57,738
You came in with
massive head trauma.

435
00:58:57,872 --> 00:58:59,273
Your brain was swelling.

436
00:58:59,407 --> 00:59:01,510
We had to keep you in
a medically induced coma.

437
00:59:01,642 --> 00:59:02,877
Dad.

438
00:59:03,444 --> 00:59:04,678
What was that?

439
00:59:04,812 --> 00:59:08,349
Can you, my father,
he was just here.

440
00:59:08,482 --> 00:59:10,519
Can you go get him?

441
00:59:10,651 --> 00:59:13,522
Oh, no honey, there
was a younger man

442
00:59:13,654 --> 00:59:17,825
who came by initially, but
I haven't seen him in a while.

443
00:59:19,627 --> 00:59:21,829
I'm sorry.

444
00:59:25,166 --> 00:59:27,968
Additionally you have
some broken bones.

445
00:59:28,102 --> 00:59:30,071
Two compressed fractures.

446
01:01:37,064 --> 01:01:38,933
- Hannah Blair?
- Yes?

447
01:01:39,066 --> 01:01:40,367
I'm officer Jones.

448
01:01:40,501 --> 01:01:41,536
This is officer Lewis.

449
01:01:41,670 --> 01:01:43,204
May we come inside?

450
01:01:43,337 --> 01:01:45,139
Why?
What is this about?

451
01:01:45,272 --> 01:01:46,974
Is your
father Tobias Blair?

452
01:01:51,979 --> 01:01:53,682
Hello, Ms. Blair.

453
01:01:53,814 --> 01:01:56,750
My name is Janice Keller and
I'm a grief counselor working

454
01:01:56,884 --> 01:01:57,751
for the city.

455
01:01:59,720 --> 01:02:02,489
I first want to extend to
you my deepest condolences.

456
01:02:02,624 --> 01:02:03,692
Hannah Blair?

457
01:02:03,824 --> 01:02:05,527
Right this way.

458
01:02:05,660 --> 01:02:07,761
Now the two officers
you spoke with informed me

459
01:02:07,895 --> 01:02:09,830
that you had some questions.

460
01:02:09,964 --> 01:02:12,099
Well, I'm here to answer
any that you may have.

461
01:02:12,233 --> 01:02:15,836
As well as assist you in any
arraignments you need to make.

462
01:02:17,238 --> 01:02:19,873
I have a pamphlet here
I'd like you to read.

463
01:02:20,007 --> 01:02:22,042
It may help answer many
of those questions.

464
01:02:22,176 --> 01:02:24,278
Can you tell me what
the hell happened?

465
01:02:24,411 --> 01:02:26,113
'Cause nobody can
seem to tell me.

466
01:02:26,247 --> 01:02:27,848
Well, there's still
a lot that we don't know.

467
01:02:27,982 --> 01:02:31,018
Why don't you tell
me what you do know.

468
01:02:31,151 --> 01:02:33,722
Okay, I'm really here to help
you answer your questions

469
01:02:33,854 --> 01:02:34,888
on what to do next.

470
01:02:35,022 --> 01:02:36,824
You know they say he drowned?

471
01:02:37,659 --> 01:02:38,593
But he could swim.

472
01:02:38,727 --> 01:02:40,562
He taught me how to swim.

473
01:02:40,695 --> 01:02:42,997
He was on boats his entire life.

474
01:02:43,130 --> 01:02:46,534
You wanna explain to me how
someone like that drowns?

475
01:03:06,387 --> 01:03:10,157
He was found in the water
between his boat and the dock.

476
01:03:10,291 --> 01:03:13,595
Sometimes if
it's dark, or...

477
01:03:13,728 --> 01:03:16,665
someone's inebriated,
there's just enough of a gap

478
01:03:16,797 --> 01:03:18,032
to fall into.

479
01:03:19,199 --> 01:03:22,102
It just takes one wrong step.

480
01:03:22,236 --> 01:03:26,273
He was in a position where
essentially he was stuck.

481
01:03:26,407 --> 01:03:28,242
He couldn't pull himself out.

482
01:03:31,680 --> 01:03:33,180
He got tired.

483
01:03:33,314 --> 01:03:37,451
He couldn't keep his head
above water, and he drowned.

484
01:03:40,287 --> 01:03:42,856
It happens more
often than you think.

485
01:03:42,990 --> 01:03:44,258
How?

486
01:03:44,391 --> 01:03:45,760
I mean wouldn't
somebody have heard him?

487
01:03:45,893 --> 01:03:47,428
We honestly don't know.

488
01:03:47,562 --> 01:03:51,165
The police have interviewed
a few people, but not all.

489
01:03:55,969 --> 01:03:57,539
I'd like to see him.

490
01:04:01,241 --> 01:04:03,377
We have some photos for you.

491
01:04:23,364 --> 01:04:26,266
He was in the water
for a considerable time.

492
01:04:27,201 --> 01:04:29,269
You might not recognize him.

493
01:04:52,359 --> 01:04:56,564
I never came this
close to death before.

494
01:05:00,300 --> 01:05:03,003
I wasn't there when my mom died.

495
01:05:03,872 --> 01:05:05,540
She died alone.

496
01:05:06,574 --> 01:05:08,576
I didn't witness her go.

497
01:05:09,878 --> 01:05:12,980
I've spent my whole adult
life trying to face it.

498
01:05:13,113 --> 01:05:16,283
Just hoping to
understand, and...

499
01:05:18,285 --> 01:05:20,287
now I realize there's--

500
01:05:20,421 --> 01:05:22,990
there's nothing to understand.

501
01:05:31,198 --> 01:05:33,601
Do you think this
is all there is?

502
01:05:35,102 --> 01:05:36,571
I don't know.

503
01:05:36,704 --> 01:05:39,473
I don't think anyone does.

504
01:05:39,607 --> 01:05:42,577
But I do know they
still remain with us.

505
01:05:43,477 --> 01:05:44,978
In our memories.

506
01:06:05,232 --> 01:06:07,702
Thanks for coming out.

507
01:06:09,470 --> 01:06:11,673
So why'd you want to meet here?

508
01:06:12,105 --> 01:06:14,642
It's pretty here.

509
01:06:14,776 --> 01:06:16,376
It's been a while.

510
01:06:18,245 --> 01:06:20,247
I wanted to see you...

511
01:06:20,380 --> 01:06:24,117
and... apologize.

512
01:06:26,153 --> 01:06:27,589
I'm sober.

513
01:06:27,722 --> 01:06:30,257
It's just, it's
just over 10 months.

514
01:06:32,426 --> 01:06:33,695
Okay.

515
01:06:37,130 --> 01:06:38,700
Anything else?

516
01:06:40,635 --> 01:06:42,069
Look, I know what
you're thinking,

517
01:06:42,202 --> 01:06:44,772
but I've never made it
this far before.

518
01:06:44,906 --> 01:06:49,209
And I wanted to be sure
before I saw you again.

519
01:06:50,310 --> 01:06:53,347
And when was the last time
you saw me?

520
01:06:53,480 --> 01:06:56,651
Did you come check on me
when I was in the hospital?

521
01:06:56,784 --> 01:07:00,053
I know you knew I was in there
because the police told me.

522
01:07:00,187 --> 01:07:01,589
It was a bad time for me.

523
01:07:01,723 --> 01:07:04,526
What about when I was
learning to walk again?

524
01:07:05,693 --> 01:07:07,562
Did you check on me?

525
01:07:08,863 --> 01:07:12,800
You know, I haven't
needed you in a while,

526
01:07:12,934 --> 01:07:18,472
but it would have been nice
to have had my dad, you know?

527
01:07:25,847 --> 01:07:27,515
I'm sorry.

528
01:07:27,649 --> 01:07:31,586
You always say you're
sorry but you never change.

529
01:07:46,366 --> 01:07:49,136
You remember I took
you down here as a kid?

530
01:07:51,471 --> 01:07:53,173
Watch the boats go by.

531
01:07:55,877 --> 01:07:58,746
Saw what kind of fish
people were catching.

532
01:08:00,548 --> 01:08:03,116
You used to play
down on those rocks.

533
01:08:04,351 --> 01:08:07,387
I probably shouldn't
have let you done that.

534
01:08:08,022 --> 01:08:09,591
Do you remember?

535
01:08:14,862 --> 01:08:16,798
We'd stay to watch the sunset.

536
01:08:19,199 --> 01:08:24,171
I'd point at it,
and you'd say,

537
01:08:24,304 --> 01:08:28,442
"Look at the sun going down.

538
01:08:28,576 --> 01:08:30,344
That's where mommy is.

539
01:08:31,713 --> 01:08:33,581
"And every day,

540
01:08:33,715 --> 01:08:36,450
she'll be there
waiting for you."

541
01:08:41,154 --> 01:08:42,624
I know you miss her.

542
01:08:43,992 --> 01:08:47,127
But you're not the only
one who grieves, okay?

543
01:08:48,029 --> 01:08:49,897
It wasn't easy for me either.

544
01:08:53,367 --> 01:08:55,637
And I know I messed up.

545
01:08:56,537 --> 01:08:58,405
I was a shitty father.

546
01:09:01,341 --> 01:09:03,611
But...

547
01:09:03,745 --> 01:09:05,245
But it's going to be
different this time.

548
01:09:05,379 --> 01:09:09,117
I'm done with drinking.

549
01:09:09,249 --> 01:09:14,287
And... I want to see...

550
01:09:14,421 --> 01:09:16,090
I want to see you more.

551
01:09:16,223 --> 01:09:18,258
That's what this is about.

552
01:09:20,427 --> 01:09:25,432
Now we can... we can
take our time with it...

553
01:09:25,566 --> 01:09:28,368
I mean, however--
however you want to do it.

554
01:09:29,771 --> 01:09:33,841
Just, you just tell me what,
what you want me to do.

555
01:09:46,319 --> 01:09:47,822
I remember.

556
01:09:52,860 --> 01:09:56,430
And that's why, when you called,
I came down here today.

557
01:09:58,933 --> 01:10:01,936
To tell you goodbye.

558
01:10:03,671 --> 01:10:09,409
I'm so glad you're getting help,
but I can't be a part of it.

559
01:10:13,447 --> 01:10:15,683
But what you can do for me?

560
01:10:16,951 --> 01:10:19,020
Don't call.

561
01:10:19,153 --> 01:10:22,289
Don't show up.

562
01:10:22,824 --> 01:10:25,560
Just stay away.

563
01:10:31,231 --> 01:10:32,633
Stay away.

564
01:11:04,264 --> 01:11:05,199
I still remember my father.

565
01:11:05,332 --> 01:11:07,769
I wanna see him.

566
01:11:10,805 --> 01:11:12,640
I wanna see him, goddammit!

567
01:12:15,468 --> 01:12:17,872
I left the country.

568
01:12:18,005 --> 01:12:21,676
I thought there was
something for me to find.

569
01:12:21,809 --> 01:12:24,879
I didn't mean to hurt you.

570
01:12:25,012 --> 01:12:29,349
Did you find what
you were looking for?

571
01:12:31,552 --> 01:12:33,087
No.

572
01:22:06,861 --> 01:22:08,228
I remember.

573
01:23:48,830 --> 01:23:51,465
I told you.

574
01:23:51,599 --> 01:23:54,769
The answer is always the same.

575
01:24:03,277 --> 01:24:05,647
I just miss her.

576
01:24:07,080 --> 01:24:09,551
And I know he did too.

577
01:24:13,888 --> 01:24:17,224
Stay here with me.

578
01:24:18,458 --> 01:24:20,294
Isn't that what you want?

579
01:24:25,098 --> 01:24:26,601
You're right.

580
01:24:26,734 --> 01:24:28,268
I am angry.

581
01:24:28,736 --> 01:24:30,237
Even afraid.

582
01:24:34,074 --> 01:24:36,911
But I don't want to be anymore.
