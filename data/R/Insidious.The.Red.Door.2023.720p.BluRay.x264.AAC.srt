1
00:01:09,151 --> 00:01:10,528
Are you ready?

2
00:01:12,989 --> 00:01:13,990
We're ready.

3
00:01:15,533 --> 00:01:17,869
Ready to forget once and for all.

4
00:01:17,952 --> 00:01:19,537
Good, Mr. Lambert.

5
00:01:19,620 --> 00:01:22,790
So then, close your eyes.

6
00:01:24,125 --> 00:01:25,126
Both of you.

7
00:01:27,003 --> 00:01:28,421
Now take a deep breath.

8
00:01:29,130 --> 00:01:33,718
Now feel yourselves
getting sleepier and sleepier.

9
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:37,847
Neither of you will remember the last year.

10
00:01:38,890 --> 00:01:41,934
There is no place called The Further.

11
00:01:43,269 --> 00:01:46,439
You will only remember Dalton's coma.

12
00:01:48,024 --> 00:01:49,817
And his recovery.

13
00:01:50,860 --> 00:01:54,697
And let the darkness drift further...

14
00:01:55,489 --> 00:01:58,743
and further away.

15
00:02:20,556 --> 00:02:23,100
For everything, there is a season.

16
00:02:25,895 --> 00:02:27,188
A time to be born...

17
00:02:29,023 --> 00:02:30,191
and a time to die.

18
00:02:33,361 --> 00:02:34,403
A time to kill...

19
00:02:36,113 --> 00:02:37,114
a time to heal.

20
00:02:38,866 --> 00:02:40,159
A time to keep...

21
00:02:41,410 --> 00:02:43,621
and a time to throw away.

22
00:02:46,958 --> 00:02:47,959
A time to weep...

23
00:02:48,709 --> 00:02:50,253
and a time to laugh.

24
00:02:55,007 --> 00:02:58,427
A time to mourn, and a time to dance.

25
00:02:59,804 --> 00:03:01,097
A time for silence...

26
00:03:06,936 --> 00:03:08,312
and a time to speak.

27
00:03:10,982 --> 00:03:12,608
A time for love...

28
00:03:13,234 --> 00:03:14,735
and a time to hate.

29
00:03:16,529 --> 00:03:19,115
A time for war, and a time for peace.

30
00:03:20,449 --> 00:03:21,450
Amen.

31
00:03:21,534 --> 00:03:22,618
Amen.

32
00:03:29,417 --> 00:03:32,587
We therefore commit
this body to the ground.

33
00:03:32,670 --> 00:03:36,048
Earth to earth, ashes to ashes,

34
00:03:36,132 --> 00:03:37,675
dust to dust.

35
00:03:38,217 --> 00:03:39,217
Amen.

36
00:03:52,190 --> 00:03:54,984
It was a beautiful service
for a beautiful grandma.

37
00:03:55,067 --> 00:03:57,195
She loved you guys so much.

38
00:03:58,362 --> 00:04:01,157
Your mother was a fine friend, Josh.

39
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:02,074
Thank you.

40
00:04:02,158 --> 00:04:04,285
I miss Grandma.

41
00:04:04,368 --> 00:04:06,329
I know she misses you too, Kali.

42
00:04:06,412 --> 00:04:08,331
Dead people don't miss anything.

43
00:04:08,414 --> 00:04:11,542
Okay, that's not true,
and she does miss you.

44
00:04:14,921 --> 00:04:16,923
See you guys next weekend, okay?

45
00:04:18,257 --> 00:04:19,257
Dalton.

46
00:04:20,968 --> 00:04:22,178
Dalton!

47
00:04:25,932 --> 00:04:28,184
- See what I mean?
- He's just anxious about leaving.

48
00:04:30,228 --> 00:04:32,230
For school next week.

49
00:04:33,356 --> 00:04:35,483
I know.
Yeah, no.

50
00:04:36,567 --> 00:04:37,567
Um...

51
00:04:39,487 --> 00:04:42,657
Thank you for organising all this.
I just haven't had the bandwidth.

52
00:04:46,786 --> 00:04:48,412
Why don't you drive him to school?

53
00:04:48,496 --> 00:04:50,581
You have a few weeks
until all your students show up.

54
00:04:50,665 --> 00:04:54,085
- Nah, he wouldn't want me to.
- He's not the parent, you are.

55
00:04:54,168 --> 00:04:56,021
If you don't want to,
then that's a different story, but...

56
00:04:56,045 --> 00:04:57,045
No, I can't.

57
00:04:59,423 --> 00:05:00,423
Why?

58
00:05:03,302 --> 00:05:04,302
Wh...

59
00:05:11,018 --> 00:05:13,062
It was just an idea.

60
00:05:13,145 --> 00:05:16,232
Maybe some way that you guys could connect,
that's all.

61
00:05:16,315 --> 00:05:18,109
He's gonna be gone soon, so...

62
00:05:18,192 --> 00:05:19,610
Anyway, think about it.

63
00:05:24,115 --> 00:05:26,158
Bye.
See you, man.

64
00:05:36,294 --> 00:05:37,295
Excuse me.

65
00:05:41,007 --> 00:05:42,884
Excuse me.
Hey.

66
00:05:45,052 --> 00:05:46,052
Do I know you?

67
00:05:48,264 --> 00:05:49,640
I knew your mother.

68
00:05:49,724 --> 00:05:51,475
Years ago.
Um...

69
00:05:52,768 --> 00:05:54,562
But we lost touch.

70
00:05:57,273 --> 00:05:58,482
What's your name?

71
00:06:01,694 --> 00:06:02,695
Carl.

72
00:06:10,328 --> 00:06:11,871
Nice to meet you, Carl.

73
00:06:12,496 --> 00:06:14,336
Appreciate you coming.
I'm sorry I grabbed you.

74
00:06:14,373 --> 00:06:16,542
- I got a lot on my mind.
- I'm sure.

75
00:06:16,626 --> 00:06:19,128
Death floods the mind with memory.

76
00:06:20,546 --> 00:06:22,715
But there's always new ones to make, right?

77
00:06:24,091 --> 00:06:25,134
Yeah.

78
00:06:25,218 --> 00:06:26,219
Bye, Josh.

79
00:06:30,515 --> 00:06:32,725
Carl.

80
00:06:52,245 --> 00:06:53,246
Carl.

81
00:07:23,943 --> 00:07:24,943
Uh...

82
00:07:50,970 --> 00:07:54,098
What did you just tell me?
Well, just tell me, Dalton.

83
00:07:55,391 --> 00:07:56,392
Or change it?

84
00:07:56,475 --> 00:07:59,729
Do you wanna clean...?
Do you wanna keep the same diaper on?

85
00:07:59,812 --> 00:08:00,855
Yeah?

86
00:08:00,938 --> 00:08:01,939
I tell you what.

87
00:08:02,023 --> 00:08:06,903
We can just clean out the diaper
and then put the same diaper back on.

88
00:08:07,612 --> 00:08:08,821
Would you like that?

89
00:08:09,822 --> 00:08:12,325
You like that?
Okay, I'll do that, then.

90
00:08:15,203 --> 00:08:16,871
What kind of outfit do you want?

91
00:08:18,331 --> 00:08:19,957
Oh... oop.

92
00:08:20,875 --> 00:08:23,395
Oop. What kind of outfit do you want?

93
00:08:23,461 --> 00:08:27,006
Yeah? Well, tell me.
All you got to do is talk to me.

94
00:08:29,675 --> 00:08:32,553
Come on.
It's the greatest guy in the world.

95
00:08:35,181 --> 00:08:36,182
Oh, shit.

You got, uh, two outlets...

Guess Mom put it in there.

144
00:14:31,746 --> 00:14:32,788
Wow.

145
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:37,251
This is intense.
This what you been working on?

146
00:14:37,335 --> 00:14:39,420
- Put it back.
- No, it's really good.

Did you do this from memory?

148
00:14:42,173 --> 00:14:43,966
It's from a photo I found at the house.

149
00:14:44,926 --> 00:14:46,427
Wow, looks like she's, uh...

150
00:14:47,136 --> 00:14:49,180
Like she's hiding something?

151
00:14:49,263 --> 00:14:50,973
That's what it feels like.

152
00:14:52,183 --> 00:14:54,101
Felt like.
The last few years.

153
00:14:55,269 --> 00:14:57,897
She had a tough go, you know,
being a single mom.

154
00:15:00,107 --> 00:15:03,110
Yeah, yeah, that's...
Yeah, that's tough.

155
00:15:13,496 --> 00:15:15,081
Guess I didn't make the wall, huh?

156
00:15:19,585 --> 00:15:20,670
I don't blame you.

157
00:15:22,421 --> 00:15:24,381
You know, I'm sorry I
haven't been around lately.

158
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:28,594
Of course, my dad
wasn't around at all, but...

159
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:30,930
So it could be a lot worse.

160
00:15:32,890 --> 00:15:36,394
I've just been a little
foggy past few years.

161
00:15:36,477 --> 00:15:38,271
I don't know, my brain just...

162
00:15:39,188 --> 00:15:40,231
I just...

163
00:15:41,315 --> 00:15:44,527
haven't been able to manage a time

164
00:15:44,610 --> 00:15:47,280
for, uh, you and your brother and sister.

165
00:15:47,780 --> 00:15:49,574
Have you ever thought about getting help?

166
00:15:52,577 --> 00:15:54,078
I'm just trying to push through.

167
00:15:58,457 --> 00:16:00,668
- Are you Dalton Lambert?
- Yeah. Are you...?

168
00:16:00,751 --> 00:16:02,170
Chris Winslow.

169
00:16:07,133 --> 00:16:09,844
- Everything cool, fellas?
- Yeah, no, everything's fine.

170
00:16:09,927 --> 00:16:12,471
I just... I thought
my roommate would be a, um...

171
00:16:12,555 --> 00:16:13,555
Um...

172
00:16:13,598 --> 00:16:14,891
Uh, a guy.

173
00:16:14,974 --> 00:16:15,974
Yeah.

174
00:16:16,475 --> 00:16:17,475
Oh.

175
00:16:18,311 --> 00:16:21,647
I just figured it's a liberal arts school,
and we mean "liberal."

176
00:16:21,731 --> 00:16:24,317
Yeah, probably just confused
by the name "Chris."

177
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:28,070
Right. 'Cause that would never happen
with a name like "Dalton."

178
00:16:28,154 --> 00:16:30,406
You know, I'm gonna go down
to the housing office

179
00:16:30,489 --> 00:16:31,699
and get this all sorted out.

180
00:16:31,782 --> 00:16:35,745
No, no, no.
Please, father of Dalton. Allow me.

181
00:16:35,828 --> 00:16:38,539
I clearly interrupted some boy bonding.

182
00:16:39,207 --> 00:16:40,208
I'll be back.

183
00:16:45,505 --> 00:16:46,505
Hey.
Uh...

184
00:16:47,632 --> 00:16:49,217
I snagged this for you.

185
00:16:49,300 --> 00:16:50,718
You should check it out.

186
00:16:50,801 --> 00:16:54,263
If you hate it, no worries.
But you're not gonna hate it.

187
00:16:56,390 --> 00:16:58,351
You really don't know me, do you?

188
00:16:58,434 --> 00:17:01,062
I mean, you really think
I wanna join a frat?

189
00:17:02,146 --> 00:17:03,981
It's just a party, Dalton.

190
00:17:04,774 --> 00:17:06,358
Go.
Have fun.

191
00:17:06,442 --> 00:17:08,402
I mean, do it for me.
I drove you here.

192
00:17:08,486 --> 00:17:10,404
- You didn't even want to.
- Of course I did.

193
00:17:10,488 --> 00:17:11,781
Stop lying to me!

194
00:17:13,199 --> 00:17:15,409
I heard what Mom said at the funeral.

195
00:17:16,077 --> 00:17:17,078
Well, I still did it.

196
00:17:17,161 --> 00:17:19,121
Oh, so that makes you
father of the year now?

197
00:17:19,204 --> 00:17:20,498
At least you've got a father.

198
00:17:20,580 --> 00:17:22,500
Stop blaming your dad
for shit you screwed up.

199
00:17:22,583 --> 00:17:25,461
He left like 40 years ago.
Get over it.

200
00:17:25,545 --> 00:17:27,463
God knows I'm not gonna be defined by you.

201
00:17:27,547 --> 00:17:30,132
Are you kidding me?
After all we have done for you?

202
00:17:30,216 --> 00:17:32,718
When did you become
this ungrateful, little shit?

203
00:17:36,013 --> 00:17:37,390
No wonder Mom divorced you.

204
00:17:38,516 --> 00:17:39,976
Thanks for the ride.

205
00:19:31,838 --> 00:19:33,673
You can tell it's Shania Twain, right?

206
00:19:34,340 --> 00:19:35,340
Yeah.

207
00:19:36,467 --> 00:19:38,427
So, what'd they say at housing?

208
00:19:38,511 --> 00:19:39,887
They said, "Tough titties."

209
00:19:39,971 --> 00:19:41,681
I got to sleep here tonight.

210
00:19:41,764 --> 00:19:44,725
But I'll get a new room tomorrow,
so it's not a permanent thing.

211
00:19:44,809 --> 00:19:46,102
Heartbreak, right?

212
00:19:47,687 --> 00:19:50,648
- You're in the art school, I take it?
- Yeah. Are you music?

213
00:19:50,731 --> 00:19:52,400
Math.
I thought about music,

214
00:19:52,483 --> 00:19:54,735
but the artist's life
is one of nomadic instability

215
00:19:54,819 --> 00:19:56,195
and much gnashing of teeth.

216
00:19:57,864 --> 00:20:00,116
But I'm sure you'll be super successful.

217
00:20:01,993 --> 00:20:04,328
- You wanna blow my hooter?
- What?

218
00:20:04,912 --> 00:20:05,955
Do you play?

219
00:20:06,038 --> 00:20:07,373
Oh.

220
00:20:07,456 --> 00:20:10,710
- Uh, just a little piano.
- It's the same thing. Just blow.

221
00:20:14,922 --> 00:20:16,424
My cooties are good cooties.

222
00:20:29,604 --> 00:20:30,771
What's that?

223
00:20:30,855 --> 00:20:32,857
It's just something my mom wrote.

224
00:20:32,940 --> 00:20:34,192
Sweet.

225
00:20:36,068 --> 00:20:37,068
So...

226
00:20:38,154 --> 00:20:39,572
what's some weird shit about you?

227
00:20:42,867 --> 00:20:43,951
I don't know.

228
00:20:44,035 --> 00:20:46,662
Uh...
"I don't know."

229
00:20:47,580 --> 00:20:49,123
Come on, man.
Everybody's weird.

230
00:20:50,291 --> 00:20:51,125
You first.

231
00:20:51,209 --> 00:20:54,337
On Sundays, I wear a monocle
and I order takeout with a British accent.

232
00:20:54,420 --> 00:20:55,922
That is weird.

233
00:20:56,005 --> 00:20:57,340
Thank you.

234
00:20:57,423 --> 00:21:01,135
Okay, sometimes I eat instant oatmeal,

235
00:21:01,219 --> 00:21:04,347
uh, with no, like,
water or milk or anything.

236
00:21:04,430 --> 00:21:06,599
It's just kind of dry.

237
00:21:07,433 --> 00:21:08,809
You're bad at this.

238
00:21:08,893 --> 00:21:10,228
Let's try again.

239
00:21:10,311 --> 00:21:12,230
When I was 10, my parents died,

240
00:21:12,313 --> 00:21:14,082
and I went to go live
with my Grandma Perkee,

241
00:21:14,106 --> 00:21:17,818
who once went almost nearly blind
from a gnarly case of athlete's foot.

242
00:21:20,279 --> 00:21:22,156
I don't remember when I was 10.

243
00:21:22,990 --> 00:21:25,243
Like, the whole year.

244
00:21:25,326 --> 00:21:26,410
What do you mean?

245
00:21:28,079 --> 00:21:29,497
I was in a coma.

246
00:21:29,580 --> 00:21:31,290
Viral meningitis.

247
00:21:31,374 --> 00:21:32,834
At least that's what they told me,

248
00:21:32,917 --> 00:21:35,169
the few times that
they would talk about it.

249
00:21:35,253 --> 00:21:38,673
But I don't remember anything.

250
00:21:38,756 --> 00:21:40,466
I don't even remember being sick.

251
00:21:40,550 --> 00:21:44,887
It's like I woke up one day
and a whole year had passed.

252
00:21:46,305 --> 00:21:47,515
That's awful.

253
00:21:48,766 --> 00:21:50,101
And pretty weird.

254
00:21:51,060 --> 00:21:52,144
Well done.

255
00:21:52,228 --> 00:21:55,398
Yeah, honestly, I wish I could have
forgotten a whole year when I was a kid.

256
00:21:56,983 --> 00:21:58,818
Could've used a little "meningi-gi."

257
00:22:01,654 --> 00:22:07,118
Uh... you know,
there is one more weird thing about me.

258
00:22:07,201 --> 00:22:13,249
Um, ever since my coma,
I've been afraid of the dark.

259
00:22:13,332 --> 00:22:17,086
I was afraid of Barbie dolls
till I was, like... now.

260
00:22:18,171 --> 00:22:19,881
There's nothing wrong with being scared.

261
00:22:19,964 --> 00:22:22,725
Just as long as you don't keep me up
with some bright-ass night light.

262
00:22:23,509 --> 00:22:24,509
Um...

263
00:22:27,805 --> 00:22:29,432
- Seriously?
- Sorry.

264
00:22:29,515 --> 00:22:31,267
Oh, man.
Whatever.

265
00:22:31,350 --> 00:22:33,603
It's fine.
I'll deal.

266
00:22:48,826 --> 00:22:50,226
Hey, this is Dalton.

267
00:22:50,286 --> 00:22:51,686
I can't get to the phone right now,

268
00:22:51,746 --> 00:22:53,831
so leave me a message
and I'll give you a call back.

269
00:22:53,915 --> 00:22:56,042
Hey, bud. It's me.

270
00:22:56,125 --> 00:22:58,503
Just making sure you're
getting settled in okay.

271
00:22:58,586 --> 00:22:59,587
Um...

272
00:23:00,963 --> 00:23:04,717
I was just, uh,
thinking about what you said...

273
00:23:05,885 --> 00:23:07,053
and, um...

274
00:23:09,180 --> 00:23:14,519
I don't know. I don't know
what's going on with me, but, um...

275
00:23:16,562 --> 00:23:17,855
I'm gonna find out.

276
00:23:20,399 --> 00:23:22,485
And I just wanted you to know that.

277
00:23:26,781 --> 00:23:27,865
Okay, bye.

278
00:23:55,017 --> 00:23:55,852
Hello.

279
00:23:55,935 --> 00:23:58,104
I am Professor Armagan.

280
00:23:58,729 --> 00:24:00,606
Shut off your phones.

281
00:24:00,690 --> 00:24:03,025
Open your portfolios.

282
00:24:03,109 --> 00:24:05,695
Pull out something that will interest me.

283
00:24:08,781 --> 00:24:10,116
Pin it to your easel.

284
00:24:10,783 --> 00:24:12,493
Stand beside your work.

285
00:24:12,577 --> 00:24:14,495
Stand proud.

286
00:24:23,754 --> 00:24:25,006
Alec Anderson.

287
00:24:25,673 --> 00:24:27,300
Your technique is obvious.

288
00:24:27,383 --> 00:24:29,802
- It looks like a photograph.
- Thanks.

289
00:24:29,886 --> 00:24:31,804
That wasn't a compliment.

290
00:24:33,890 --> 00:24:35,224
Tear it up.

291
00:24:35,308 --> 00:24:36,350
Excuse me?

292
00:24:36,434 --> 00:24:38,394
The drawing.
Tear it up.

293
00:24:39,478 --> 00:24:41,731
I worked my ass off on this piece.

294
00:24:41,814 --> 00:24:43,441
No one will miss it.

295
00:24:45,860 --> 00:24:46,861
No way.

296
00:24:47,862 --> 00:24:51,157
Alas, our first casualty.

297
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:55,661
Usually, I go through introductions
before someone quits.

298
00:24:55,745 --> 00:24:57,997
- I didn't quit.
- Yes, you did.

299
00:24:58,080 --> 00:25:01,584
You just haven't realised it yet.
You can go.

300
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:13,721
Good luck.

301
00:25:16,307 --> 00:25:19,477
Any fool can learn technique.

302
00:25:19,560 --> 00:25:20,978
Even master it.

303
00:25:21,812 --> 00:25:25,858
It doesn't mean anything
if it doesn't come from inside.

304
00:25:26,734 --> 00:25:30,988
I am not interested in the "rules of art."

305
00:25:31,072 --> 00:25:33,324
We are going to break the rules.

306
00:25:35,076 --> 00:25:37,537
Then I want you to break them again.

307
00:25:37,620 --> 00:25:39,539
See how broken you can get.

308
00:25:48,840 --> 00:25:49,924
Dalton Lambert.

309
00:25:50,591 --> 00:25:51,425
Yes, ma'am?

310
00:25:51,509 --> 00:25:55,638
Why in the hell would you destroy
a beautiful drawing like that?

311
00:26:02,728 --> 00:26:04,689
Once more for good measure?

312
00:26:08,150 --> 00:26:09,777
Wasn't so hard, was it?

313
00:26:12,655 --> 00:26:15,741
Good.
You must let go of your past.

314
00:26:16,325 --> 00:26:18,953
Shed your skin in order to grow.

315
00:26:19,036 --> 00:26:21,247
I'll count backwards from ten.

316
00:26:21,330 --> 00:26:22,999
With each number,

317
00:26:23,082 --> 00:26:28,796
I want you to sink
further and further into yourself.

318
00:26:29,839 --> 00:26:32,633
Do not lift the charcoal from the paper.

319
00:26:33,843 --> 00:26:34,843
Ten...

320
00:26:35,261 --> 00:26:36,721
nine...

321
00:26:37,555 --> 00:26:42,143
eight, seven, six...

322
00:26:42,852 --> 00:26:44,061
five...

323
00:26:44,729 --> 00:26:49,567
four, three, two...

324
00:26:50,776 --> 00:26:51,777
one.

325
00:26:54,405 --> 00:26:57,325
Draw whatever your soul brings forth.

326
00:26:57,408 --> 00:26:59,827
An experience that defines you.

327
00:27:02,121 --> 00:27:04,749
You've got to be willing to dredge up

328
00:27:04,832 --> 00:27:07,543
your ugliest, innermost thoughts.

329
00:28:32,879 --> 00:28:35,256
Is it keeping you in or out?

330
00:28:44,724 --> 00:28:46,559
You'll have headphones on.

331
00:28:46,642 --> 00:28:50,688
The machine is quite loud,
but you'll be able to hear me.

332
00:28:51,272 --> 00:28:55,943
I'm going to need you to stay as still
as possible throughout the procedure.

333
00:28:56,652 --> 00:28:58,738
If you feel like you
need to get out of there,

334
00:28:58,821 --> 00:29:01,490
give the call ball a squeeze,
we'll give you a break.

335
00:29:02,408 --> 00:29:03,409
You good?

336
00:29:04,160 --> 00:29:05,161
Overjoyed.

337
00:29:05,953 --> 00:29:06,953
All aboard.

338
00:29:20,343 --> 00:29:22,470
Hit this.

339
00:29:37,235 --> 00:29:39,529
Okay. You comfortable, Josh?

340
00:29:40,154 --> 00:29:42,698
Yep.
Let's just get this over with.

341
00:30:20,194 --> 00:30:21,194
Hello?

342
00:30:24,365 --> 00:30:25,741
Dr. Brower?

343
00:30:30,162 --> 00:30:31,247
Dr. Brower?

344
00:30:33,958 --> 00:30:36,127
There's someone with you.

345
00:30:36,210 --> 00:30:38,546
What?
What did you say?

346
00:30:40,631 --> 00:30:42,133
Dr. Brower, what did you say?

347
00:30:49,682 --> 00:30:50,682
Wh...

348
00:30:53,853 --> 00:30:54,854
Come on.

349
00:30:56,772 --> 00:30:57,772
Um...

350
00:30:58,441 --> 00:30:59,942
Okay, can you let me out, please?

351
00:31:01,277 --> 00:31:03,779
Hello, hey!

352
00:31:04,906 --> 00:31:06,449
Can you let me out?

353
00:31:07,825 --> 00:31:09,285
The door is open.

354
00:31:10,411 --> 00:31:14,040
Okay, okay. Let me out. Let me out.
Hey! Dr. Brower.

355
00:31:14,123 --> 00:31:15,499
Dr. Brower, let me out.

356
00:31:15,583 --> 00:31:17,335
Come on.
Get me out of here.

357
00:31:17,418 --> 00:31:19,712
Hello?
Hey!

358
00:31:25,051 --> 00:31:28,179
Just let me out.
Let me out, let me out, let me out.

359
00:31:29,305 --> 00:31:31,766
Dr. Brower.
Come on.

360
00:31:34,644 --> 00:31:35,728
Let me out.

361
00:32:01,587 --> 00:32:02,672
Okay.
Come on.

362
00:32:07,176 --> 00:32:08,010
Mr. Lambert?

363
00:32:08,094 --> 00:32:09,571
- What was that? What was that?
- Are you okay?

364
00:32:09,595 --> 00:32:12,181
- Who was that? Why did the lights go out?
- Calm down.

365
00:32:12,265 --> 00:32:14,183
You said the lights went out?

366
00:32:14,267 --> 00:32:16,811
All the lights went out
and I got stuck in there, man.

367
00:32:16,894 --> 00:32:17,895
And I saw...

368
00:32:22,608 --> 00:32:23,985
- What...
- Mr. Lambert,

369
00:32:24,068 --> 00:32:26,362
you've been asleep for 15 minutes.

370
00:32:26,445 --> 00:32:30,157
You went right out.
Your MRI went perfectly.

371
00:32:35,204 --> 00:32:37,540
- What?
- Take your time to get dressed.

372
00:32:37,623 --> 00:32:38,624
Come on through.

373
00:32:50,928 --> 00:32:52,889
There's nothing physically wrong with you.

374
00:32:52,972 --> 00:32:55,349
No growths or spots on the brain.

375
00:32:55,892 --> 00:32:57,143
Nothing to be concerned about.

376
00:33:01,731 --> 00:33:04,734
That's good news, Mr. Lambert.

377
00:33:05,526 --> 00:33:07,820
Yeah, no, I know, I, uh...

378
00:33:10,239 --> 00:33:12,200
I guess I was just
hoping for something real.

379
00:33:13,618 --> 00:33:16,913
Something that could explain this fog.

380
00:33:16,996 --> 00:33:18,664
The memory issues you're talking about,

381
00:33:18,748 --> 00:33:20,833
they could be spurred
on by a number of things.

382
00:33:20,917 --> 00:33:24,462
Increased stress, change in daily habits.

383
00:33:24,545 --> 00:33:27,548
Have there been any
disruptions in your home life?

384
00:33:29,717 --> 00:33:32,303
My, uh, mom passed away recently.

385
00:33:32,803 --> 00:33:34,597
I'm sorry for your loss.

386
00:33:36,766 --> 00:33:38,768
Not to mention my son left for school,

387
00:33:38,851 --> 00:33:42,772
and, uh, my ex-wife
hardly talks to me, so...

388
00:33:43,481 --> 00:33:45,608
- That certainly sounds stressful.
- Yeah.

389
00:33:45,691 --> 00:33:48,402
Maybe a grief counsellor be of some help?

390
00:33:50,321 --> 00:33:52,031
Yeah. Sure.
Probably would.

391
00:33:54,534 --> 00:33:57,870
Do you have any history
of mental illness in your family?

392
00:33:59,539 --> 00:34:00,706
Mental illness?

393
00:34:00,790 --> 00:34:02,333
It's nothing to be alarmed about.

394
00:34:02,416 --> 00:34:04,669
It can be informative
as we try to make a diagnosis.

395
00:34:04,752 --> 00:34:06,003
Not that I'm aware of.

396
00:34:06,087 --> 00:34:07,338
It's worth looking into.

397
00:34:08,631 --> 00:34:10,091
Meanwhile, there are exercises,

398
00:34:10,174 --> 00:34:12,134
games you can do to stimulate your memory.

399
00:34:12,217 --> 00:34:14,637
Matching games.
Like kids do.

400
00:34:15,263 --> 00:34:17,181
You want me to play kids' games?

401
00:34:17,806 --> 00:34:19,600
We can learn a lot from kids.

402
00:34:23,020 --> 00:34:24,020
Yeah.

403
00:34:27,900 --> 00:34:28,943
Thanks.

404
00:37:54,857 --> 00:37:55,900
Whatcha doin'?

405
00:38:01,197 --> 00:38:03,032
Got my new room assignment today.

406
00:38:03,115 --> 00:38:05,576
So, alas, no more panty parties.

407
00:38:05,660 --> 00:38:08,246
But consolation, I'm in 323 now.

408
00:38:08,329 --> 00:38:09,705
Right above you.

409
00:38:09,789 --> 00:38:10,998
So be cautious, young man,

410
00:38:11,082 --> 00:38:13,543
lest I hear you slap your sausage
in the dead of night.

411
00:38:20,383 --> 00:38:22,468
- You want to join a frat?
- What?

412
00:38:23,177 --> 00:38:24,053
Oh.

413
00:38:24,136 --> 00:38:25,763
No, it's just something my dad got me.

414
00:38:27,223 --> 00:38:28,432
We should go.

415
00:38:29,058 --> 00:38:31,352
We can make fun of their khaki pants
and trust funds.

416
00:38:31,894 --> 00:38:33,563
Unless you're not done redecorating.

417
00:38:35,231 --> 00:38:37,733
Come on, Dolphin.
Do something nice for your old man.

418
00:38:37,817 --> 00:38:39,902
What's the worst that could happen?

419
00:38:45,032 --> 00:38:46,868
May I offer you some diaper pudding?

420
00:38:46,951 --> 00:38:48,578
Uh, I'm good.

421
00:38:49,579 --> 00:38:50,955
Oh, no.

422
00:38:51,038 --> 00:38:52,039
Whatever.

423
00:38:52,707 --> 00:38:53,958
Seriously?

424
00:38:54,041 --> 00:38:56,919
Oh, come on.
Quit your bitching and come here.

425
00:38:57,003 --> 00:39:00,631
To memorialize the night
that Dalton Lambert actually has fun!

426
00:39:04,969 --> 00:39:08,681
Go! Go! Go!

427
00:39:22,069 --> 00:39:23,571
What's "frat juice"?

428
00:39:24,238 --> 00:39:25,781
- Don't ask.
- Hey, hey, hey!

429
00:39:25,865 --> 00:39:27,742
Everyone, my name's Nick.

430
00:39:27,825 --> 00:39:33,539
Nick the Dick!
Nick the Dick! Nick the Dick!

431
00:39:33,623 --> 00:39:36,626
Welcome to the Kappa House,
and welcome back to school, baby.

432
00:39:37,710 --> 00:39:43,257
I'm just here to remind
you fine folks that frats,

433
00:39:43,341 --> 00:39:44,592
they're under attack.

434
00:39:45,218 --> 00:39:48,721
Right, and we must
protect our right to party

435
00:39:48,804 --> 00:39:50,389
and to be awesome.

436
00:39:50,473 --> 00:39:54,268
White, Black, brown, or blue,
you're all welcome at JPU,

437
00:39:54,352 --> 00:39:57,605
provided that you recognise

438
00:39:57,688 --> 00:39:59,273
and respect

439
00:39:59,357 --> 00:40:02,610
that the frat house is the last house

440
00:40:02,693 --> 00:40:04,570
where men can still be men.

441
00:40:09,700 --> 00:40:10,700
Whoo!

442
00:40:11,035 --> 00:40:12,245
Thank you.

443
00:40:12,912 --> 00:40:15,248
Now, we got a lot of
drinking to do tonight,

444
00:40:15,331 --> 00:40:17,416
but pace yourselves.

445
00:40:18,251 --> 00:40:20,294
We do not need another incident.

446
00:40:20,378 --> 00:40:22,463
This party's lame.

447
00:40:22,547 --> 00:40:25,466
Confirmed. So let's go upstairs
and look through everyone's shit.

448
00:40:27,844 --> 00:40:30,513
♪ But you came right on time
Can we turn off all these lights? ♪

449
00:40:30,596 --> 00:40:34,058

452
00:40:39,856 --> 00:40:40,856
Yeah.

453
00:40:50,241 --> 00:40:51,784
We should make this quick.

454
00:40:54,537 --> 00:40:57,081
Permission to proceed granted.

455
00:40:58,916 --> 00:40:59,916
Wait.

456
00:41:12,847 --> 00:41:14,974
Huh. Oh. Wow.

457
00:41:19,562 --> 00:41:20,938
Oh, no.

458
00:41:21,564 --> 00:41:22,690
This is Nick's room.

459
00:41:22,773 --> 00:41:24,567
And this is Nick's butthole cream.

460
00:41:24,650 --> 00:41:27,904
I'm going to go spread this
on the communal crapper. BRB.

461
00:41:27,987 --> 00:41:28,988
Wait.

462
00:41:58,893 --> 00:41:59,893
Hey, man...

463
00:42:08,694 --> 00:42:10,196
Hey, man, you okay?

464
00:42:10,863 --> 00:42:13,324
You need water or something?

465
00:42:13,407 --> 00:42:14,742
Make it stop.

466
00:42:16,327 --> 00:42:18,538
Make it stop.

467
00:42:18,621 --> 00:42:19,622
Make it stop.

468
00:42:21,290 --> 00:42:22,416
Close the door.

469
00:42:24,585 --> 00:42:25,586
Close the...

470
00:42:27,672 --> 00:42:28,965
Close the door!

471
00:42:31,801 --> 00:42:35,221
I'll be right back.
I just need some supplies.

472
00:42:40,476 --> 00:42:43,646
Hey, Paige.
I am Nick.

473
00:42:46,440 --> 00:42:50,862
♪ Tonight is your night, bro
Tonight is the night ♪

474
00:42:54,740 --> 00:42:55,783
Got you.

475
00:43:02,915 --> 00:43:04,333
Come on, man.

476
00:43:06,752 --> 00:43:08,004
Just be you, bro.

477
00:43:11,257 --> 00:43:12,383
You want to dance?

478
00:43:12,466 --> 00:43:14,802
A dance would be nice.
We can dance.

479
00:43:18,264 --> 00:43:19,265
Let's dance.

480
00:43:36,407 --> 00:43:38,618
♪ Tonight is the night, bro ♪

481
00:44:50,314 --> 00:44:51,524
Be quiet!

482
00:44:54,277 --> 00:44:55,278
Are you good?

483
00:44:57,738 --> 00:44:59,407
I think I just saw something...

484
00:44:59,490 --> 00:45:00,490
What?

485
00:45:03,160 --> 00:45:04,453
We need to go.

486
00:45:04,537 --> 00:45:06,122
- Now.
- But this is just getting fun.

487
00:45:06,205 --> 00:45:08,666
- Is somebody in my room?
- Shit, shit, shit.

488
00:45:08,749 --> 00:45:11,252
One of you peckerwoods is about
to get the hammer drop.

489
00:45:14,338 --> 00:45:15,673
What the hell?

490
00:45:16,549 --> 00:45:19,385
Oh, my God.
So sorry.

491
00:45:20,011 --> 00:45:23,848
We were just looking for
some privacy, you know?

492
00:45:23,931 --> 00:45:25,224
We were gonna do it.

493
00:45:27,435 --> 00:45:28,936
I'd rather watch my parents do it.

494
00:45:30,062 --> 00:45:32,356
But you should stick around.

495
00:45:32,440 --> 00:45:34,775
We might get drunk enough
to find you attractive.

496
00:45:36,235 --> 00:45:37,904
Even though you look like a clown.

497
00:45:39,197 --> 00:45:41,324
Nick the Dick, huh?

498
00:45:42,074 --> 00:45:43,910
I'm more partial to kick the dick.

499
00:45:44,452 --> 00:45:45,494
Oh!

500
00:45:45,578 --> 00:45:46,704
Run!

501
00:45:52,418 --> 00:45:54,545
That was pretty quick thinking
back there, right?

502
00:45:54,629 --> 00:45:55,630
I, uh...

503
00:45:56,506 --> 00:45:57,924
Oh, crap.

504
00:45:58,007 --> 00:46:00,110
I should've asked
before I kissed you, right?

505
00:46:00,134 --> 00:46:02,595
I am sorry. I was just...
I was going on instinct.

506
00:46:02,678 --> 00:46:04,514
- Oh, no...
- Are you okay?

507
00:46:04,597 --> 00:46:06,098
I'm fine.
It's just, I, um...

508
00:46:12,480 --> 00:46:15,816
I'm just sorry for what he said to you.

509
00:46:16,567 --> 00:46:17,567
Oh.

510
00:46:17,944 --> 00:46:18,945
Whatever.

511
00:46:19,862 --> 00:46:21,948
You think I care what
Vineyard Vines thinks?

512
00:46:22,031 --> 00:46:23,366
He should be so lucky.

513
00:46:24,283 --> 00:46:27,245
Hey, buddy, it is, uh, me again.

514
00:46:27,328 --> 00:46:29,622
Um, I went to the doctor.

515
00:46:29,705 --> 00:46:32,083
Um, and everything's okay.

516
00:46:33,251 --> 00:46:35,878
Well, not okay.
But I'm getting to the bottom of it.

517
00:46:35,962 --> 00:46:38,297
So, uh, just give me a call when you can.

518
00:46:38,381 --> 00:46:40,883
All right, I, uh...

519
00:46:41,551 --> 00:46:44,428
I'm really sorry, Dalton,
about what I said the other day.

520
00:46:46,597 --> 00:46:47,640
All right, bye.

521
00:49:56,329 --> 00:49:58,329
Where's my mayonnaise?

522
00:50:02,043 --> 00:50:03,044
Who is it?

523
00:51:08,484 --> 00:51:10,528
Please don't tell me
you're really just a creep.

524
00:51:10,611 --> 00:51:12,196
What?
No.

525
00:51:12,280 --> 00:51:13,823
Then what the hell is going on?

526
00:51:16,033 --> 00:51:17,159
Come on in.

527
00:51:27,795 --> 00:51:31,340
Something's happening to me.
I'm seeing things, crazy things.

528
00:51:31,424 --> 00:51:35,803
You know that kid at the frat house
that they talked about, with the incident?

529
00:51:35,887 --> 00:51:38,306
- Uh-huh.
- I saw him. And he was dead.

530
00:51:40,141 --> 00:51:42,143
It started with an art exercise,

531
00:51:42,226 --> 00:51:47,398
and she asked us to dig deep
into a memory, into our subconscious.

532
00:51:47,481 --> 00:51:50,526
So I did and I drew this door.

533
00:51:50,610 --> 00:51:52,290
You really need to lay off the frat juice.

534
00:51:52,361 --> 00:51:53,362
I'm serious.

535
00:51:54,822 --> 00:51:58,117
Tonight, I was painting and I fell asleep.

536
00:51:58,201 --> 00:52:00,912
And when I woke up, this lantern appeared.

537
00:52:00,995 --> 00:52:03,206
It was like a dream,
but it wasn't a dream.

538
00:52:03,289 --> 00:52:06,459
And then I walked to your room.

539
00:52:07,793 --> 00:52:10,129
I know how this sounds.

540
00:52:24,894 --> 00:52:27,730
I feel like I'm getting
closer to something.

541
00:52:28,814 --> 00:52:30,816
Or something's getting closer to me.

542
00:52:36,822 --> 00:52:38,115
You got an extra pillow?

543
00:54:30,394 --> 00:54:31,395
Okay.

544
00:54:32,480 --> 00:54:33,564
Foster.

545
00:54:34,815 --> 00:54:35,900
Renai.

546
00:54:38,361 --> 00:54:39,362
Dalton.

547
00:54:42,031 --> 00:54:43,032
Kali.

548
00:54:46,077 --> 00:54:47,078
Dalton.

549
00:54:49,539 --> 00:54:50,540
Dalton?

550
00:54:51,999 --> 00:54:53,000
Dalton.

551
00:54:59,340 --> 00:55:00,340
Mom.

552
00:55:29,078 --> 00:55:30,079
Okay.

553
00:55:32,373 --> 00:55:33,916
Okay, Mom, help me out.

554
00:55:38,421 --> 00:55:39,421
Kali.

555
00:55:40,506 --> 00:55:42,466
Dalton.
Dalton.

556
00:55:43,885 --> 00:55:44,886
Mom.

557
00:55:47,471 --> 00:55:48,471
Mom?

558
00:55:50,016 --> 00:55:51,017
Mom.

559
00:55:52,435 --> 00:55:54,604
I don't know. I don't know.

560
00:56:29,305 --> 00:56:30,306
Okay.

561
00:56:57,959 --> 00:56:58,959
Damn it.

562
00:58:01,397 --> 00:58:02,690
Chiaroscuro.

563
00:58:04,984 --> 00:58:06,986
The dance of light and shadow.

564
00:58:08,613 --> 00:58:13,034
An effect used not only
to create volume and definition,

565
00:58:13,117 --> 00:58:17,038
but also a specific, unseen light source.

566
00:58:18,623 --> 00:58:21,667
Right.
This is one of Goya's best.

567
00:58:22,668 --> 00:58:26,005
The negative space draws
our eyes towards Saturn.

568
00:58:26,589 --> 00:58:30,760
Does it represent darkness or some void?

569
00:58:31,928 --> 00:58:33,763
Goya mastered it on the canvas,

570
00:58:33,846 --> 00:58:40,144
but family problems and health issues
sent this once-revered court painter

571
00:58:40,228 --> 00:58:42,146
into a dark spiral,

572
00:58:42,230 --> 00:58:45,274
leading him to create this grisly portrait

573
00:58:45,358 --> 00:58:48,236
of a father devouring his son.

574
00:58:52,240 --> 00:58:56,619
This balance between light and dark
is what we're after.

575
00:58:57,328 --> 00:58:58,329
Get ready.

576
00:59:02,124 --> 00:59:07,797
Your own experiences shape your artwork.
Embrace them. Use them.

577
00:59:08,297 --> 00:59:12,385
Sink deep into the darkness of memory.

578
00:59:13,219 --> 00:59:14,387
Ten...

579
00:59:15,304 --> 00:59:16,305
nine...

580
00:59:17,181 --> 00:59:18,182
eight...

581
00:59:18,891 --> 00:59:19,892
seven...

582
00:59:20,685 --> 00:59:21,686
six...

583
00:59:22,353 --> 00:59:23,479
five...

584
00:59:23,980 --> 00:59:24,981
four...

585
00:59:25,606 --> 00:59:26,607
three...

586
00:59:27,400 --> 00:59:28,401
two...

587
00:59:29,068 --> 00:59:30,069
one...

588
01:00:23,581 --> 01:00:25,541
- 'Sup, nerd?
- A red door.

589
01:00:25,625 --> 01:00:26,876
Uh, a purple pecker.

590
01:00:26,959 --> 01:00:29,504
Come on, man. Doesn't that
mean anything to you? A red door?

591
01:00:29,587 --> 01:00:31,380
You sound weirder than usual.

592
01:00:32,048 --> 01:00:34,425
It's a thing from art class.
It's a painting.

593
01:00:34,509 --> 01:00:36,802
We had to find a memory.

594
01:00:37,595 --> 01:00:39,239
I thought it was something
from our childhood.

595
01:00:39,263 --> 01:00:40,263
Did you ask Mom?

596
01:00:40,765 --> 01:00:42,600
No, I don't want to worry her.

597
01:00:42,683 --> 01:00:43,851
Why would that worry her?

598
01:00:46,896 --> 01:00:49,482
- I don't know.
- This what happens when you go to college?

599
01:00:49,565 --> 01:00:50,816
You get all cryptic and shit?

600
01:00:51,943 --> 01:00:52,944
I guess.

601
01:00:53,027 --> 01:00:54,195
Well, I'm not going, then.

602
01:01:21,722 --> 01:01:25,017
So after the whole spooky
dream-not-a-dream thing the other night,

603
01:01:25,101 --> 01:01:26,435
I started thinking:

604
01:01:26,519 --> 01:01:30,231
"Yeah, okay, Dalton's a weirdo,
but he's not insane, right?"

605
01:01:30,314 --> 01:01:31,732
I'm gonna need that key back.

606
01:01:31,816 --> 01:01:35,611
Right. So I started poking
around the old interwebs...

607
01:01:36,654 --> 01:01:37,655
and guess what?

608
01:01:38,322 --> 01:01:39,991
You're not crazy at all.

609
01:01:40,074 --> 01:01:43,077
You are an astral projector.

610
01:01:44,036 --> 01:01:45,037
Check this out.

611
01:01:45,705 --> 01:01:48,165
Looks like they filmed it
in between shifts at Best Buy.

612
01:01:48,249 --> 01:01:52,170
Hey, guys, this is Spectral Sightings.
I'm Specs, this is Tucker. Say hi, Tucker.

613
01:01:52,253 --> 01:01:54,672
- No.
- Okay. We are PPI,

614
01:01:54,755 --> 01:01:57,466
Professional Paranormal Investigators.

615
01:01:57,550 --> 01:01:59,736
Today, we're gonna be talking about
something that dozens of you

616
01:01:59,760 --> 01:02:01,512
have been asking us about.

617
01:02:01,596 --> 01:02:03,514
- Astral projection.
- Astral projection.

618
01:02:03,598 --> 01:02:04,849
It's a real phenomenon.

619
01:02:04,932 --> 01:02:06,726
Our physical body falls asleep

620
01:02:06,809 --> 01:02:10,897
and our astral body leaves
that physical body...

621
01:02:11,480 --> 01:02:13,941
and floats off into another realm.

622
01:02:14,025 --> 01:02:16,905
- That's exactly what it feels like.
- See, I told you. It's cool, right?

623
01:02:16,986 --> 01:02:19,530
Our former mentor, Dr. Elise Rainier,

624
01:02:19,614 --> 01:02:21,824
she had a name for this other realm.

625
01:02:21,908 --> 01:02:24,368
- She called it The Further.
- Hold on.

626
01:02:29,999 --> 01:02:31,959
I am Elise.

627
01:02:32,502 --> 01:02:33,753
It's nice to see you all.

628
01:02:34,462 --> 01:02:38,758
So I'm here to talk to you
about astral projection...

629
01:02:39,759 --> 01:02:41,802
and The Further.

630
01:02:41,886 --> 01:02:43,095
Okay...

631
01:02:44,472 --> 01:02:45,806
give me a minute here.

632
01:02:46,933 --> 01:02:47,934
Three...

633
01:02:48,976 --> 01:02:49,977
two...

634
01:02:51,729 --> 01:02:52,730
one.

635
01:02:54,774 --> 01:02:55,775
The Further...

636
01:02:57,652 --> 01:02:59,570
is a dark realm...

637
01:03:00,154 --> 01:03:02,573
filled with tortured souls of the dead...

638
01:03:03,658 --> 01:03:07,370
and some are doomed...

639
01:03:08,704 --> 01:03:11,123
to live the worst mistakes of their lives

640
01:03:11,207 --> 01:03:14,001
over and over and over for all eternity.

641
01:03:15,253 --> 01:03:16,879
When you astral project...

642
01:03:17,505 --> 01:03:19,298
or you travel to this realm...

643
01:03:20,049 --> 01:03:21,551
these are the souls...

644
01:03:22,301 --> 01:03:24,220
that you awaken with your presence.

645
01:03:24,846 --> 01:03:26,264
They can smell you.

646
01:03:27,139 --> 01:03:29,725
The presence of life.

647
01:03:31,227 --> 01:03:33,187
Life is what they crave,

648
01:03:33,271 --> 01:03:34,897
more than anything.

649
01:03:34,981 --> 01:03:37,567
So the further you travel...

650
01:03:39,652 --> 01:03:41,696
the riskier the journey becomes.

651
01:03:42,363 --> 01:03:46,617
They want life, and they can come
to our world to get it.

652
01:03:47,827 --> 01:03:50,037
Keep a steady stride.

653
01:03:56,335 --> 01:03:59,130
I see those gears turning.
What is it?

654
01:04:00,339 --> 01:04:03,342
- That kid from the frat house?
- The pukey kid?

655
01:04:03,426 --> 01:04:05,553
Yeah.
He said something to me.

656
01:04:06,429 --> 01:04:08,556
He said, "Close the door."

657
01:04:08,639 --> 01:04:10,839
I'm sure he did.
It probably wasn't his proudest moment.

658
01:04:11,475 --> 01:04:15,229
Yeah, but what if he meant something else?

659
01:04:15,313 --> 01:04:16,981
What if he was talking about this door?

660
01:04:18,149 --> 01:04:20,067
So, what?
You want to go back and ask him?

661
01:04:23,029 --> 01:04:23,863
Seriously?

662
01:04:23,946 --> 01:04:25,198
I need to know.

663
01:04:25,281 --> 01:04:27,533
Look, I feel bad for the dude, I do,

664
01:04:27,617 --> 01:04:31,787
but dark realms are typically
places I try to avoid.

665
01:04:32,455 --> 01:04:35,917
There's something important

666
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:37,418
about this painting, Chris.

667
01:04:39,545 --> 01:04:41,005
I have to find out.

668
01:04:42,256 --> 01:04:43,256
Okay.

669
01:04:46,052 --> 01:04:48,864
It's not like Nick the Dick is just gonna
let you waltz into his bedroom

670
01:04:48,888 --> 01:04:50,515
and chat with the ghost in his toilet.

671
01:04:51,766 --> 01:04:52,850
He'll never know I'm there.

672
01:05:06,113 --> 01:05:07,365
So, what's the plan?

673
01:05:07,448 --> 01:05:08,950
- I got this.
- Can I help you?

674
01:05:12,703 --> 01:05:14,121
Hello.

675
01:05:14,205 --> 01:05:17,583
I have left my brassiere
in Nicholas's room,

676
01:05:17,667 --> 01:05:20,002
and I was wondering if
he is perchance home?

677
01:05:20,920 --> 01:05:23,798
I think he's upstairs studying with Paige.

678
01:05:25,758 --> 01:05:27,438
Great job, Dolphin.

679
01:05:28,678 --> 01:05:32,098
I'm gonna read you this.
It's called In Flames.

680
01:05:32,181 --> 01:05:35,893
Very vulnerable piece.
"Looking across a campfire..."

681
01:05:40,940 --> 01:05:42,441
I need a room with darkness.

682
01:05:42,525 --> 01:05:43,526
Okay.

683
01:05:47,196 --> 01:05:48,197
Then what?

684
01:05:48,739 --> 01:05:52,660
You gonna float through the air
and do a little "Ooh"?

685
01:05:54,161 --> 01:05:55,288
I'm not like a ghost.

686
01:05:55,371 --> 01:05:57,915
And you never will be
with that attitude, Casper.

687
01:06:00,042 --> 01:06:01,042
Bingo.

688
01:06:06,007 --> 01:06:08,217
What are the chances
those bedsheets are crusty?

689
01:06:08,301 --> 01:06:10,219
Probably snap like a taco shell.

690
01:06:10,845 --> 01:06:12,096
I'll take the dirty floor.

691
01:06:17,476 --> 01:06:18,686
Okay...

692
01:06:26,527 --> 01:06:29,405
- Can you give me a little space, please?
- Oh, yeah. Sorry.

693
01:06:38,998 --> 01:06:39,999
Okay, you ready?

694
01:06:43,711 --> 01:06:46,214
Ten, nine...

695
01:06:46,797 --> 01:06:49,175
eight, seven...

696
01:06:50,092 --> 01:06:52,637
six, five...

697
01:06:53,888 --> 01:06:56,432
four, three...

698
01:06:57,433 --> 01:07:00,311
two, one.

699
01:07:14,575 --> 01:07:15,826
Are you floating yet?

700
01:07:28,256 --> 01:07:29,632
Farewell, traveller.

701
01:07:41,269 --> 01:07:42,549
You out here, Dalton?

702
01:08:06,544 --> 01:08:08,546
creative writing double major.

703
01:08:09,463 --> 01:08:13,885
But I'm also crazy good at finance,
so I don't want to waste that gift.

704
01:08:14,510 --> 01:08:16,596
How long do you have to keep that on?

705
01:08:17,721 --> 01:08:18,721
Oh.

706
01:08:19,807 --> 01:08:20,808
Yeah, it's good now.

707
01:08:22,518 --> 01:08:23,810
My pores are good.

708
01:08:44,122 --> 01:08:45,124
Oh.

709
01:09:01,432 --> 01:09:02,683
I'm gonna be a while.

710
01:09:03,392 --> 01:09:04,685
Gross.

711
01:09:19,200 --> 01:09:20,200
Dalton?

712
01:09:22,453 --> 01:09:23,578
Dalton.

713
01:09:26,832 --> 01:09:28,626
Someone turn on the lights!

714
01:09:35,716 --> 01:09:36,716
Dalton.

715
01:09:37,218 --> 01:09:38,219
Dalton.

716
01:09:41,180 --> 01:09:42,180
Dalton, wake up.

717
01:09:42,223 --> 01:09:43,325
- Guys! Seriously.
- Chris.

718
01:09:43,349 --> 01:09:45,560
Guys, who's messing with me?

719
01:09:45,643 --> 01:09:47,060
Close the door!

720
01:09:47,603 --> 01:09:49,063
Close the door!

721
01:09:50,606 --> 01:09:51,606
Dalton?

722
01:10:01,868 --> 01:10:03,268
- Close the door!
- Chris!

723
01:10:21,053 --> 01:10:22,053
Oh, God.

724
01:10:30,104 --> 01:10:31,105
Come on!

725
01:10:38,988 --> 01:10:39,989
Chris.

726
01:10:41,657 --> 01:10:42,783
What...?

727
01:11:07,517 --> 01:11:08,518
Come on.

728
01:11:33,251 --> 01:11:34,251
What?

729
01:11:59,569 --> 01:12:00,570
Chris.

730
01:12:01,779 --> 01:12:03,819
- Chris. Hey. I didn't mean it like that...
- Don't.

731
01:12:06,284 --> 01:12:07,994
I just wanted to see if you're okay.

732
01:12:08,077 --> 01:12:09,245
I'm okay.

733
01:12:10,288 --> 01:12:14,000
I'm sorry. I didn't know
anyone could get hurt in the real world.

734
01:12:14,083 --> 01:12:16,002
Well, they can.

735
01:12:17,920 --> 01:12:20,047
You have no idea what you're messing with.

736
01:12:21,174 --> 01:12:23,217
I can't be a part of this, Dalton.

737
01:12:23,759 --> 01:12:26,470
And neither should you.
Because next time, you might not wake up.

738
01:12:52,079 --> 01:12:53,456
- Hey.
- Hi.

739
01:12:53,539 --> 01:12:56,542
Uh, it's not your weekend.
Kali's at a sleepover and Foster's...

740
01:12:56,626 --> 01:12:58,211
I'm not here for the kids.

741
01:12:59,545 --> 01:13:00,545
Can we talk?

742
01:13:01,839 --> 01:13:02,840
Sure.

743
01:13:11,015 --> 01:13:12,975
Wow, two calls in one week.

744
01:13:13,059 --> 01:13:15,379
- Come on, man.
- Haven't you made any friends yet?

745
01:13:17,188 --> 01:13:19,774
Tell me everything you
remember about my coma.

746
01:13:22,485 --> 01:13:23,569
You should talk to Mom.

747
01:13:23,653 --> 01:13:25,029
I think these...

748
01:13:25,947 --> 01:13:28,533
- things I'm drawing, they...
- The door?

749
01:13:28,616 --> 01:13:30,868
And now a guy with a hammer.

750
01:13:32,954 --> 01:13:37,208
- A hammer?
- I think they could be clues from my past,

751
01:13:37,291 --> 01:13:39,585
thoughts that have disappeared
'cause of my coma.

752
01:13:39,669 --> 01:13:43,256
- I don't know why they're coming out now...
- Wait. Dalton.

753
01:13:45,424 --> 01:13:46,425
What is it?

754
01:13:47,552 --> 01:13:49,554
I've had this image in my mind for years.

755
01:13:50,471 --> 01:13:54,559
Mom always says it's not real.
It's just a bad dream. But...

756
01:13:54,642 --> 01:13:57,353
Tell me, little brother.
Come on.

757
01:14:00,898 --> 01:14:04,735
Okay. We're in a room somewhere.
Like a basement.

758
01:14:06,320 --> 01:14:07,321
You remember that?

759
01:14:11,909 --> 01:14:12,952
Dalton, you there?

760
01:15:23,397 --> 01:15:25,942
All I ever wanted was to
be better than my father.

761
01:15:26,692 --> 01:15:29,737
You know that.
Just to be a good dad.

762
01:15:29,820 --> 01:15:32,490
You were.
You are, Josh.

763
01:15:32,573 --> 01:15:34,033
Well, Dalton would disagree.

764
01:15:35,034 --> 01:15:38,037
Well, if it's any consolation,
I can't even get him to call me back.

765
01:15:41,832 --> 01:15:44,043
My dad abandoned his family, and...

766
01:15:44,752 --> 01:15:46,170
I've done the same thing.

767
01:15:46,254 --> 01:15:47,547
No, you haven't.

768
01:15:47,630 --> 01:15:51,133
You're not him, Josh,
and you're allowed to be angry at him.

769
01:15:51,217 --> 01:15:53,302
I am angry.
I've been angry for a long time.

770
01:15:53,386 --> 01:15:55,137
Angry at a man that I have never met.

771
01:15:56,681 --> 01:16:00,685
Angry at a man that jumped off the roof
of a mental hospital in 1978.

772
01:16:03,604 --> 01:16:06,774
For more than 40 years,
that man has been dead and gone.

773
01:16:07,483 --> 01:16:08,484
My dad.

774
01:16:09,110 --> 01:16:10,194
Ben Burton.

775
01:16:13,155 --> 01:16:17,535
So how in the hell is he terrorizing me
here, now, in the real world?

776
01:16:18,536 --> 01:16:20,180
- He attacked me at Mom's place...
- He attacked you?

777
01:16:20,204 --> 01:16:23,499
Yeah.
So am I just crazy, or...?

778
01:16:24,834 --> 01:16:27,461
I don't know.
He, uh...

779
01:16:30,756 --> 01:16:33,676
left this for my mom the day he died.

780
01:16:36,929 --> 01:16:38,848
What ends with him?

781
01:16:41,225 --> 01:16:44,103
- Josh...
- Is that the answer? Am I just crazy?

782
01:16:44,854 --> 01:16:46,522
Is his madness inside of me?

783
01:16:46,606 --> 01:16:50,318
Is that why I've been so lost
the past few years?

784
01:16:50,401 --> 01:16:53,613
Did I pass this curse on to our kids?
Is he gonna haunt them...

785
01:16:53,696 --> 01:16:55,048
- Josh, Josh.
- like he haunted me?

786
01:16:55,072 --> 01:16:56,872
Why didn't my mother
say anything about this?

787
01:16:56,908 --> 01:16:57,908
Stop.

788
01:16:58,618 --> 01:16:59,785
You're not crazy.

789
01:17:01,287 --> 01:17:02,413
You're not crazy.

790
01:17:04,040 --> 01:17:05,374
Then what's happening to me?

791
01:17:54,799 --> 01:17:55,883
Dalton.

792
01:18:00,721 --> 01:18:05,351
So Dalton and I could
travel to some other...

793
01:18:06,853 --> 01:18:08,062
dimension...

794
01:18:09,230 --> 01:18:13,985
where we were haunted
by ghosts and goblins.

795
01:18:16,529 --> 01:18:18,990
More like entities,

796
01:18:19,073 --> 01:18:21,784
like the one in those
photos that haunted you.

797
01:18:23,244 --> 01:18:25,413
And your father, he saw them too, and...

798
01:18:25,496 --> 01:18:27,623
Maybe he's just reaching out.

799
01:18:31,460 --> 01:18:34,255
Back then, he told your mom.
She didn't understand.

800
01:18:34,338 --> 01:18:37,466
- She didn't know how to help him.
- Help him like you helped us?

801
01:18:38,467 --> 01:18:39,969
By suppressing our memories?

802
01:18:40,678 --> 01:18:44,098
We all thought it was for the best, Josh.
You included.

803
01:18:44,765 --> 01:18:47,768
But you got foggy.

804
01:18:51,606 --> 01:18:53,941
The suppression, it slowed you down.

805
01:18:54,859 --> 01:18:56,819
And your mom and I,
we didn't know what to do.

806
01:18:56,903 --> 01:18:59,280
And I was too scared to tell you the truth.

807
01:19:01,199 --> 01:19:02,325
Dalton was right.

808
01:19:04,660 --> 01:19:09,040
He said my mom had secrets,
that she was hiding something from us.

809
01:19:10,583 --> 01:19:12,710
I just never thought you did too.

810
01:19:14,629 --> 01:19:16,547
- For ten years...
- You have no idea...

811
01:19:16,631 --> 01:19:19,193
- you have kept this away from me.
- how hard it has been for me.

812
01:19:19,217 --> 01:19:20,652
- Just why? Why? Why?
- You don't understand...

813
01:19:20,676 --> 01:19:23,012
Because you tried to kill our family.

814
01:19:25,515 --> 01:19:28,392
You chased us around the house
with a goddamn baseball bat!

815
01:19:30,102 --> 01:19:31,103
- What?
- I mean, I knew

816
01:19:31,187 --> 01:19:32,980
that it wasn't you.
I knew it was that...

817
01:19:33,064 --> 01:19:36,442
thing in those photos, but the kids?
They don't understand.

818
01:19:37,026 --> 01:19:39,403
All those night terrors that Foster had.

819
01:19:39,487 --> 01:19:42,448
I've been lying to our
children for a decade,

820
01:19:42,532 --> 01:19:44,450
telling them those memories aren't real.

821
01:19:44,534 --> 01:19:47,912
"They're just your imagination.
Dad's not gonna hurt you."

822
01:19:48,538 --> 01:19:50,164
- I couldn't.
- But you did.

823
01:19:51,707 --> 01:19:54,669
Doesn't matter to them
what was controlling you.

824
01:19:55,461 --> 01:19:58,798
What they saw was your face.
It was you who was causing all that pain.

825
01:20:01,175 --> 01:20:04,554
That's why I pulled away.
I just...

826
01:20:05,805 --> 01:20:07,598
I couldn't live like that anymore.

827
01:20:19,485 --> 01:20:20,486
You know...

828
01:20:22,822 --> 01:20:24,462
we could've gotten through this together.

829
01:20:32,164 --> 01:20:33,165
Is this you?

830
01:20:36,836 --> 01:20:38,504
Dalton just sent this to me.

831
01:20:39,297 --> 01:20:41,757
He's been having nightmares and visions.

832
01:20:42,383 --> 01:20:44,010
Something about a red door.

833
01:20:46,470 --> 01:20:47,638
And now this.

834
01:20:48,848 --> 01:20:49,849
What do we do?

835
01:21:58,459 --> 01:21:59,627
I'm scared.

836
01:22:00,253 --> 01:22:01,712
It's gonna be okay.

837
01:22:01,796 --> 01:22:03,565
- It's gonna be okay.
- I don't know...

838
01:22:03,589 --> 01:22:06,259
It's okay. Nothing's gonna happen to us.
I promise you, okay?

839
01:22:06,342 --> 01:22:08,052
Take care of your brother, Dalton.

840
01:22:08,719 --> 01:22:10,680
Okay.

841
01:22:15,685 --> 01:22:16,811
Here.

842
01:22:17,436 --> 01:22:19,188
But why is Daddy mad at us?

843
01:22:34,954 --> 01:22:36,289
Mommy. Mommy...

844
01:22:36,372 --> 01:22:38,499
I can go into the dark place
and find Daddy.

845
01:22:38,583 --> 01:22:40,793
- No, it's too dangerous.
- I can do it, though.

846
01:22:41,586 --> 01:22:43,171
Okay, just be careful.

847
01:22:55,016 --> 01:22:56,017
Come on.

848
01:23:34,680 --> 01:23:37,350
No! Stop!
What are you doing?

849
01:23:39,227 --> 01:23:41,270
Stop!
What are you doing?

850
01:23:43,272 --> 01:23:45,024
Dad, please, just stop.

851
01:23:45,107 --> 01:23:46,484
Just stop!

852
01:23:47,068 --> 01:23:48,611
No!

853
01:23:50,696 --> 01:23:52,573
Stop!

854
01:24:18,224 --> 01:24:20,434
And now, my dear friends,

855
01:24:20,518 --> 01:24:24,689
I'd like to dedicate this song
to all of you out there.

856
01:24:24,772 --> 01:24:26,649
Wherever you may be,

857
01:24:26,732 --> 01:24:30,361
this song is for you.

858
01:24:40,580 --> 01:24:43,624
♪ Fill your heart with love today ♪

859
01:24:43,708 --> 01:24:47,587
♪ Don't play the game of time ♪

860
01:24:47,670 --> 01:24:51,048
♪ Things that happened in the past ♪

861
01:24:51,132 --> 01:24:54,093
♪ Happened in your mind ♪

862
01:24:54,177 --> 01:24:56,971
♪ In your mind, only in your mind ♪

863
01:24:57,054 --> 01:24:58,848
♪ In your mind ♪

864
01:24:58,931 --> 01:25:03,728
♪ Forget your mind and you'll be free ♪

865
01:25:42,099 --> 01:25:44,179
Just checking on you.

866
01:25:49,482 --> 01:25:50,482
Okay.

867
01:25:51,692 --> 01:25:53,694
Sitting on the floor, being weird.
That's normal.

868
01:25:54,779 --> 01:25:57,490
So you're good, right?
Because...

869
01:25:57,573 --> 01:25:58,842
I thought that when the power went out,

870
01:25:58,866 --> 01:26:01,226
that maybe you were messing
with that dark realm shit again.

871
01:26:02,286 --> 01:26:04,872
And I know
that you don't really care for the dark.

872
01:26:04,956 --> 01:26:07,041
So I figured...

873
01:26:07,124 --> 01:26:09,585
I would illuminate your room,

874
01:26:09,669 --> 01:26:11,712
much like how I illuminate your life.

875
01:26:12,338 --> 01:26:14,465
I'm not afraid of the dark anymore.

876
01:26:15,216 --> 01:26:16,217
Okay.

877
01:26:16,300 --> 01:26:18,261
Well, I hauled these all the way down here,

878
01:26:18,344 --> 01:26:20,054
so they're going up anyway.

879
01:26:21,013 --> 01:26:22,813
Even though you're
totally freaking annoying.

880
01:26:25,852 --> 01:26:28,229
So, um, listen...

881
01:26:30,189 --> 01:26:32,984
I got your text
and I wrote a snarky response.

882
01:26:33,067 --> 01:26:34,110
And then I deleted it,

883
01:26:34,193 --> 01:26:37,488
because Grandma Perkee always told me
to never escalate an argument over text.

884
01:26:37,572 --> 01:26:39,031
Doesn't convey tone.

885
01:26:41,534 --> 01:26:43,452
But, I mean, if you want my opinion...

886
01:26:44,704 --> 01:26:45,830
here it is.

887
01:26:47,164 --> 01:26:49,584
Don't go digging around in your past.

888
01:26:50,877 --> 01:26:53,045
Some things are just better
left buried, you know?

889
01:26:53,754 --> 01:26:54,754
And...

890
01:26:55,506 --> 01:26:58,050
sometimes you just have to move on.

891
01:27:08,436 --> 01:27:09,437
Dalton?

892
01:27:49,352 --> 01:27:50,352
Hey.

893
01:28:08,829 --> 01:28:11,207
Dalton.
You okay?

894
01:28:27,348 --> 01:28:32,019
♪ Knee-deep in flowers, we'll stray ♪

895
01:28:32,103 --> 01:28:36,649
♪ We'll keep the showers away ♪

900
01:28:59,797 --> 01:29:00,798
Dalton.

901
01:29:08,639 --> 01:29:09,891
Dalton.

902
01:29:11,517 --> 01:29:12,602
Dalton?

903
01:29:32,246 --> 01:29:33,456
Dalton?

904
01:29:39,629 --> 01:29:40,630
No.

905
01:29:46,052 --> 01:29:48,971
Oh, no!
No, no, no!

906
01:29:54,810 --> 01:29:55,853
Daddy's here.

907
01:29:56,521 --> 01:29:58,439
I'm gonna get you out
of this place, Dalton.

908
01:30:10,409 --> 01:30:12,995
We're gonna get out of here
and we're gonna get home, okay?

909
01:30:13,079 --> 01:30:14,239
We're never going back there.

910
01:30:21,587 --> 01:30:23,464
Dalton. What?

911
01:30:40,356 --> 01:30:41,440
Dalton.

912
01:30:45,444 --> 01:30:47,280
Dalton, tell me you're in there.

913
01:30:48,155 --> 01:30:49,155
Dalton.

914
01:30:50,992 --> 01:30:53,035
Dalton, I know you're in there.

915
01:30:53,119 --> 01:30:55,371
But if you touch me again,
I'm gonna fuck you up.

916
01:31:12,180 --> 01:31:13,306
Dad, no!

917
01:31:23,107 --> 01:31:24,192
You tried to kill me.

918
01:31:24,775 --> 01:31:26,319
- It wasn't me.
- I saw you!

919
01:31:27,403 --> 01:31:30,281
Dalton, these things,
they can possess our bodies.

920
01:31:30,364 --> 01:31:33,117
It happened to me,
and now he's done it to you.

921
01:31:35,703 --> 01:31:37,121
He's coming back for you.

922
01:31:38,748 --> 01:31:39,748
We've got to go.

923
01:31:44,629 --> 01:31:45,630
Come on.

924
01:32:26,128 --> 01:32:27,296
He's coming!

925
01:32:27,797 --> 01:32:28,798
Go!

926
01:32:33,678 --> 01:32:34,678
Dalton, help me!

927
01:32:36,639 --> 01:32:37,639
Help me hold the door!

928
01:32:52,738 --> 01:32:56,242
- No!
- We can't hold it back, Dad.

929
01:32:56,325 --> 01:32:58,661
Son, we got to try.

930
01:33:02,123 --> 01:33:03,666
Go, get away!

931
01:33:09,255 --> 01:33:10,464
No!

932
01:33:11,924 --> 01:33:13,885
No!
No!

933
01:33:13,968 --> 01:33:14,968
Dalton, come on!

934
01:33:15,011 --> 01:33:17,972
We got to find something to block it.
Something to seal it.

935
01:33:24,020 --> 01:33:25,396
Come on, let's go.

936
01:33:26,606 --> 01:33:28,107
- Dad, please.
- Dad!

937
01:33:28,191 --> 01:33:29,859
We have to go!

938
01:33:34,739 --> 01:33:35,781
It's okay.

939
01:33:37,658 --> 01:33:38,659
You go.

940
01:33:43,915 --> 01:33:44,915
Go.

941
01:33:57,428 --> 01:33:58,428
Get away!

942
01:34:04,352 --> 01:34:05,352
Get off!

943
01:34:07,813 --> 01:34:08,940
No!

944
01:34:18,199 --> 01:34:19,575
No!
Oh, God.

945
01:34:22,411 --> 01:34:23,454
Josh.

946
01:34:24,664 --> 01:34:25,665
Josh.

947
01:34:28,209 --> 01:34:30,920
This ends with me.

948
01:35:12,420 --> 01:35:13,504
Paint?

949
01:35:19,719 --> 01:35:21,554
Paint.
Dalton.

950
01:36:22,156 --> 01:36:24,796
You need to get rid of that thing.
Burn it, forget about it.

951
01:36:24,867 --> 01:36:28,788
No, no, forgetting it doesn't work.
We need to remember.

952
01:36:28,871 --> 01:36:30,414
Even the things that hurt.

953
01:37:06,742 --> 01:37:07,743
Dad?

954
01:38:31,911 --> 01:38:34,830
Okay. Okay. Okay.

955
01:38:38,167 --> 01:38:39,460
Is Dalton okay?

956
01:38:39,544 --> 01:38:42,213
- He's okay.
- Okay.

957
01:38:44,632 --> 01:38:45,633
That's him.

958
01:38:48,386 --> 01:38:49,220
Dalton.

959
01:38:49,303 --> 01:38:50,388
Is Dad back?

960
01:38:50,471 --> 01:38:53,015
Yes. Yes, he's back.
He's okay.

961
01:39:23,588 --> 01:39:24,839
See you next Friday.

962
01:39:25,756 --> 01:39:28,885
Tell Foster to pack his history homework.
I'll help him with it.

963
01:39:29,677 --> 01:39:32,638
Could come a little earlier if you want.
Join us for dinner.

964
01:39:34,056 --> 01:39:36,350
Yeah, I'd like that.
Thanks.

965
01:39:58,873 --> 01:39:59,916
Lovely home.

966
01:39:59,999 --> 01:40:01,334
Oh, thanks.

967
01:40:02,084 --> 01:40:04,253
- Do you live here?
- I hope so.

968
01:40:05,546 --> 01:40:06,797
That's a weird answer.

969
01:40:07,632 --> 01:40:09,383
Guess I'm just lost in memories.

970
01:40:10,134 --> 01:40:12,053
They can flood the mind.

971
01:40:20,019 --> 01:40:21,103
I know you.

972
01:40:23,898 --> 01:40:25,525
May have seen me around.

973
01:40:26,609 --> 01:40:27,902
I know your mother.

974
01:40:32,823 --> 01:40:34,450
There's so much I want to tell her.

975
01:40:35,076 --> 01:40:38,204
I know.
And you can.

976
01:40:38,955 --> 01:40:41,707
And you will.
Someday.

977
01:40:42,542 --> 01:40:44,585
You have a bright future ahead.

978
01:40:45,127 --> 01:40:46,128
You and Dalton.

979
01:40:49,799 --> 01:40:51,843
Keep a steady stride, Josh.

980
01:42:10,129 --> 01:42:11,422
Wow.

981
01:42:14,091 --> 01:42:15,259
I made the wall.

982
01:42:19,639 --> 01:42:20,639
Yeah.

983
01:42:21,891 --> 01:42:23,142
I love you, son.

984
01:42:24,268 --> 01:42:25,478
