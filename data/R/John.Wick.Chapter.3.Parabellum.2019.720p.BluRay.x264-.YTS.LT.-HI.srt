No.

540
00:52:35,713 --> 00:52:40,012
Mr. Wick, do you know where
the word "assassin" comes from?

541
00:52:41,745 --> 00:52:45,045
People argue. "Assassin."

542
00:52:46,379 --> 00:52:50,179
Hashasheen,
followers of Hassan-i...

543
00:52:51,445 --> 00:52:54,245

No, thank you.

545
00:52:58,713 --> 00:53:02,042
But others contend
it comes from asasiyyun.

546
00:53:02,044 --> 00:53:04,711
Meaning, "men who are faithful

547
00:53:04,713 --> 00:53:06,312
"and who abide
by their beliefs."

548
00:53:08,245 --> 00:53:10,809
You see that coin?

549
00:53:10,811 --> 00:53:14,242
The first coin ever minted
in this facility.

550
00:53:14,244 --> 00:53:17,775
Next to it, the first marker.

551
00:53:17,777 --> 00:53:20,242
Not easy to track down,
believe me.

552
00:53:20,244 --> 00:53:21,776
Now, this coin, of course,

553
00:53:21,778 --> 00:53:24,943
it does not represent
monetary value.

554
00:53:24,945 --> 00:53:28,076
It represents
the commerce of relationships,

555
00:53:28,078 --> 00:53:31,345
a social contract in which
you agree to partake.

556
00:53:32,478 --> 00:53:34,212

557
00:53:35,211 --> 00:53:37,176
You have broken the rules.

558
00:53:37,178 --> 00:53:40,343
The High Table
has marked you for death.

559
00:53:40,345 --> 00:53:42,376
Why would I allow you
to leave here alive,

560
00:53:42,378 --> 00:53:46,345
when your life has been
by your own actions, forfeit?

561
00:53:51,479 --> 00:53:53,346
I seek to make amends.

562
00:53:54,244 --> 00:53:56,743
To pay for what I've done.

563
00:53:56,745 --> 00:54:00,278

a great deal?

566
00:54:14,311 --> 00:54:16,443
Occasionally.

567
00:54:16,445 --> 00:54:19,876
When I leave, you can tell
the Elder I'm coming.

568
00:54:19,878 --> 00:54:21,210
And if he wants me dead...

569
00:54:21,212 --> 00:54:24,811
Then he will see to it that
your bones bleach under the sun.

570
00:54:25,812 --> 00:54:27,410
I see.

571
00:54:27,412 --> 00:54:29,746
And I would have provided him
with a choice.

572
00:54:37,078 --> 00:54:38,246
I am sorry, Mr. Wick.

573
00:54:39,945 --> 00:54:42,146
I cannot tell you
where to find the Elder.

574
00:54:45,079 --> 00:54:47,042
You fail to understand.

575
00:54:47,044 --> 00:54:49,109
The Elder
is not a man you find.

576
00:54:49,111 --> 00:54:51,444
He can only choose
to find you.

577
00:54:51,446 --> 00:54:53,444
You wish to speak with him?

578
00:54:53,446 --> 00:54:56,976

desert, look up.

you are almost dead.

583

on your last breath,

585

Or he will not.

you would be permitted
to continue to live.

- (DOOR OPENS)

1083
01:56:59,140 --> 01:57:00,174
Hmm.

1084
01:57:00,908 --> 01:57:02,242
I believe we are.

1085
01:57:08,041 --> 01:57:09,042
Parley?

1086
01:57:09,973 --> 01:57:11,242
WINSTON: Parley.

1087
01:57:14,842 --> 01:57:16,942
THE ADJUDICATOR:
What do you propose we do?

1088
01:57:21,075 --> 01:57:23,008
Let me keep my power.

1089
01:57:23,475 --> 01:57:24,775
Under the Table.

1090
01:57:27,741 --> 01:57:29,272
WINSTON: I have served

1091
01:57:29,274 --> 01:57:32,206
and been a beacon
of order and stability

1092
01:57:32,208 --> 01:57:34,338
to our industry
for over 40 years.

1093
01:57:34,340 --> 01:57:36,938
Now, I humbly acknowledge
I overstepped

1094
01:57:36,940 --> 01:57:39,843
and re-pledge my fealty
to the High Table.

1095
01:57:42,175 --> 01:57:43,775
Winston.

1096
01:57:49,308 --> 01:57:51,039
THE ADJUDICATOR: You were
merely showing strength

1097
01:57:51,041 --> 01:57:53,643
so we would let you
keep the Continental.

1098
01:57:57,108 --> 01:58:00,042
The High Table
accepts your fealty.

1099
01:58:01,308 --> 01:58:02,776
But what about him?

1100
01:58:04,908 --> 01:58:08,342
What are we going to do
about John Wick?

1101
01:58:13,908 --> 01:58:15,676
Oh, he has to die.

1102
01:58:17,107 --> 01:58:19,039
- Sorry, Jonathan.
- (GROANS) Winston!

1103
01:58:19,041 --> 01:58:20,306
Don't see any other way.

1104
01:58:20,308 --> 01:58:21,842
- (GUNSHOTS)
- (JOHN GRUNTS)

1105
01:58:22,775 --> 01:58:23,776
(GRUNTS)

1106
01:58:24,442 --> 01:58:25,975
(GROANS)

1107
01:58:32,175 --> 01:58:34,006
Very well, gentlemen.

1108
01:58:34,008 --> 01:58:37,209
The Continental will now
be reconsecrated.

1109
01:58:38,174 --> 01:58:40,041
Good day to you both.

1110
01:58:44,074 --> 01:58:45,775
Well played, sir.

1111
01:59:10,040 --> 01:59:11,942
(METAL CLINKING)

1112
01:59:21,041 --> 01:59:24,038
How long do you estimate
until we reopen?

1113
01:59:24,040 --> 01:59:25,808
Oh, should be no time at all.

1114
01:59:29,808 --> 01:59:31,707
Mr. Wick is gone.

1115
01:59:31,709 --> 01:59:33,406
A true tragedy.

1116
01:59:33,408 --> 01:59:34,972
You misunderstand.

1117
01:59:34,974 --> 01:59:37,972
I mean that he is no longer
on the street.

1118
01:59:37,974 --> 01:59:39,138
That seems improbable.

1119
01:59:39,140 --> 01:59:40,472
And yet, true.

1120
01:59:40,474 --> 01:59:41,938
(WHIMPERS)

1121
01:59:41,940 --> 01:59:44,905
I trust you understand the
repercussions if he survives.

1122
01:59:44,907 --> 01:59:47,173
Both from above and below.

1123
01:59:47,175 --> 01:59:48,905
The last thing
either one of us needs

1124
01:59:48,907 --> 01:59:51,141
is Mr. Wick paying us
a visit in the night.

1125
01:59:54,075 --> 01:59:56,072
For both our sakes,
I'll hope you see to it

1126
01:59:56,074 --> 01:59:58,338
that this situation
is taken care of, yes?

1127
01:59:58,340 --> 02:00:02,041
Absolutely.
How far can he get?

1128
02:00:04,940 --> 02:00:06,941
(INDISTINCT CHATTER)

1129
02:00:13,841 --> 02:00:15,175
Baba Yaga.

1130
02:00:15,874 --> 02:00:17,874
(WHEELS SQUEAKING)

1131
02:00:27,940 --> 02:00:29,041
BOWERY KING: Mmm.

1132
02:00:38,474 --> 02:00:39,841
(WHIMPERS)

1133
02:00:45,208 --> 02:00:46,440
(GROANS)

1134
02:00:46,442 --> 02:00:48,971
BOWERY KING:
How you doing, John?

1135
02:00:48,973 --> 02:00:51,708
You look as bad as I feel.

1136
02:00:52,241 --> 02:00:53,406
(CHUCKLES)

1137
02:00:53,408 --> 02:00:56,272
Johnny, Johnny, Johnny.

1138
02:00:56,274 --> 02:00:58,742
Raise a hand
if you can hear me, John.

1139
02:01:01,340 --> 02:01:04,272
Oh, shit.
They took a finger.

1140
02:01:04,274 --> 02:01:06,874
Ain't that a bitch?
(CHUCKLING)

1141
02:01:09,708 --> 02:01:11,642
(LAUGHS AND GROANS)

1142
02:01:12,307 --> 02:01:16,305
Oh, John fucking Wick.

1143
02:01:16,307 --> 02:01:19,006
So, the old boy
keeps his hotel

1144
02:01:19,008 --> 02:01:20,406
and you take the fall.

1145
02:01:20,408 --> 02:01:21,540
Can't say I blame him.

1146
02:01:21,542 --> 02:01:24,042
I would've done the same thing
if I was in his shoes.

1147
02:01:24,974 --> 02:01:27,741
But this High Table shit...

1148
02:01:30,741 --> 02:01:32,342
Seven cuts.

1149
02:01:32,908 --> 02:01:34,042
(CHUCKLES)

1150
02:01:35,973 --> 02:01:38,707
Under the Table
is where shit gets done.

1151
02:01:40,407 --> 02:01:43,439
And they're about to find out,
if you cut a king,

1152
02:01:43,441 --> 02:01:45,842
you better cut him
to the quick.

1153
02:01:46,275 --> 02:01:47,309
(SIGHS)

1154
02:01:50,340 --> 02:01:51,841
So...

1155
02:01:54,340 --> 02:01:56,109
Let me ask you, John.

1156
02:01:56,774 --> 02:01:57,808
How do you feel?

1157
02:02:00,307 --> 02:02:04,742
'Cause I am really pissed off.

1158
02:02:05,374 --> 02:02:07,338
You pissed, John?

1159
02:02:07,340 --> 02:02:08,805
Hmm?

1160
02:02:08,807 --> 02:02:09,907
Are you?

1161
02:02:11,175 --> 02:02:12,309
(GROANS)

1162
02:02:19,741 --> 02:02:21,342
Yeah.

1163
