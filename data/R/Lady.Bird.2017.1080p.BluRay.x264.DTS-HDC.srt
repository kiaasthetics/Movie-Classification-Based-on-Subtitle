1
00:00:31,207 --> 00:00:33,460
Do you think
I look like I'm from Sacramento?

2
00:00:35,420 --> 00:00:37,586
You are from Sacramento.

3
00:00:37,588 --> 00:00:40,172
You don't have to do that.

4
00:00:40,174 --> 00:00:43,469
Well, it's nice to make things
neat and clean.

5
00:00:47,558 --> 00:00:49,225
- You ready to go home?
- Ready.

6
00:00:50,394 --> 00:00:53,565
Her hand moved
behind his head and supported it.

7
00:00:54,898 --> 00:00:57,276
Her fingers moved
gently in his hair.

8
00:00:58,778 --> 00:01:00,946
She looked up
and across the barn,

9
00:01:02,449 --> 00:01:09,870
and her lips came together
and smiled mysteriously.

10
00:01:09,872 --> 00:01:11,496
You've been listening to...

11
00:01:11,498 --> 00:01:12,938
...The Grapes of Wrath,

12
00:01:13,375 --> 00:01:15,461
by John Steinbeck. If you...

13
00:01:19,006 --> 00:01:21,882
Our college trip
took 21 hours and five minutes.

14
00:01:28,183 --> 00:01:31,478
Hey, wait. Let's just sit
with what we heard.

15
00:01:33,397 --> 00:01:35,646
- Are you serious?
- Well, we don't have to constantly

16
00:01:35,648 --> 00:01:37,368
be entertaining ourselves, do we?

17
00:01:45,784 --> 00:01:47,828
I wish I could
live through something.

18
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:50,872
- Aren't you?
- Nope.

19
00:01:52,082 --> 00:01:56,000
The only exciting thing about
2002 is that it's a palindrome.

20
00:01:56,002 --> 00:01:59,170
Okay, fine. Well, yours is the
worst life of all, so you win.

21
00:01:59,172 --> 00:02:00,797
- Oh, so now you're mad...
- No, it's just...

22
00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:02,131
- because I wanted to listen to music?
- You're being ridiculous,

23
00:02:02,133 --> 00:02:04,468
- because you have a great life.
- I'm sorry I'm not perfect.

24
00:02:04,470 --> 00:02:07,179
No one's asking you to be perfect.
Just considerate would do.

25
00:02:07,181 --> 00:02:09,598
I don't even want to go to
school in this state anyway.

26
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:12,769
I hate California.
I want to go to the East Coast.

27
00:02:12,771 --> 00:02:15,604
Your dad and I will barely be
able to afford in-state tuition.

28
00:02:15,606 --> 00:02:17,899
- There are loans, scholarships.
- Your very smart brother...

29
00:02:17,901 --> 00:02:20,818
- he can't even find a job.
- He and Shelly work. They have jobs.

30
00:02:20,820 --> 00:02:23,028
They bag at the grocery store.
That is not a career.

31
00:02:23,030 --> 00:02:24,948
And they went to Berkeley.

32
00:02:24,950 --> 00:02:27,241
Your father's company is laying
off people right and left.

33
00:02:27,243 --> 00:02:28,827
Did you even know that?
No, of course you don't,

34
00:02:28,829 --> 00:02:34,958
because you don't think
about anybody but yourself.

35
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:37,377
And Immaculate Heart
is already a luxury.

36
00:02:37,379 --> 00:02:39,169
Immaculate Fart.
You wanted that, not me.

37
00:02:39,171 --> 00:02:42,675
Miguel saw someone knifed
in front of him at Sac High.

38
00:02:42,677 --> 00:02:45,009
Is that what you want?
So, you're telling me

39
00:02:45,011 --> 00:02:47,638
that you want to see somebody
knifed right in front of you?

40
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:50,682
He barely saw that.
I wanna go where culture is,

41
00:02:50,684 --> 00:02:52,100
- like New York, or at least Connecticut...
- How in the world

42
00:02:52,102 --> 00:02:53,477
did I raise such a snob?

43
00:02:53,479 --> 00:02:55,104
...or New Hampshire,
where writers live in the woods.

44
00:02:55,106 --> 00:02:56,813
You couldn't get
into those schools, anyway.

45
00:02:56,815 --> 00:02:58,648
- Mom!
- You can't even pass your driver's test.

46
00:02:58,650 --> 00:03:00,401
Because you wouldn't
let me practice enough!

47
00:03:00,403 --> 00:03:02,944
The way that you work...
or the way that you don't work...

48
00:03:02,946 --> 00:03:05,031
you're not even worth
state tuition, Christine.

49
00:03:05,033 --> 00:03:07,824
- My name is Lady Bird.
- Well, actually, it's not,

50
00:03:07,826 --> 00:03:08,992
- and it's ridiculous...
- Call me Lady Bird,

51
00:03:08,994 --> 00:03:10,870
- because your name is Christine.
- Like you said you would.

52
00:03:10,872 --> 00:03:13,122
You should just go to city college.
You know, with your work ethic,

53
00:03:13,124 --> 00:03:16,249
just go to city college, and then to
jail, and then back to city college,

54
00:03:16,251 --> 00:03:20,254
and then maybe you'd learn to pull
yourself up and not expect everybody to...

55
00:03:20,256 --> 00:03:22,089
In the name of the Father,

56
00:03:22,091 --> 00:03:24,426
and the Son,
and the Holy Spirit.

57
00:03:24,428 --> 00:03:25,718
Amen.

58
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:28,598
- Let the Lord be with you.
- And also with you.

59
00:03:29,183 --> 00:03:32,183
I want to welcome all of you back to
the start of the new school year,

60
00:03:32,185 --> 00:03:35,105
all the Xavier boys
and Immaculate Heart girls.

61
00:03:35,647 --> 00:03:37,938
TEACHER, STUDENTS:
Hail Mary, full of grace.

62
00:03:37,940 --> 00:03:40,067
The Lord is with thee.

63
00:03:40,069 --> 00:03:42,486
Blessed art thou
amongst women...

64
00:03:42,488 --> 00:03:44,570
Glory to you, O Lord.

65
00:03:44,572 --> 00:03:47,657
TEACHER, STUDENTS:
I pledge allegiance to the Flag

66
00:03:47,659 --> 00:03:50,242
of the United States of America,

67
00:03:50,244 --> 00:03:52,871
and to the Republic
for which it stands,

68
00:03:52,873 --> 00:03:57,584
one Nation under God, indivisible,
with liberty and justice for all.

69
00:03:57,586 --> 00:04:01,588
A vote for Amanda is a vote for boys,
boys and healthy vending machines,

70
00:04:01,590 --> 00:04:04,049
because no one wants a muffin
with that many calories.

71
00:04:04,051 --> 00:04:05,345
Whoo!

72
00:04:06,679 --> 00:04:10,138
Do not ask me, "Mr. Bruno,
is this gonna be on the finals,"

73
00:04:10,140 --> 00:04:11,808
or, "Mr. Bruno, is this
gonna be on the midterm?"

74
00:04:11,810 --> 00:04:14,518
Because I'm not gonna tell you.
That is none of your business.

75
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:16,354
Those aren't the rules. This is my house.

76
00:04:16,356 --> 00:04:19,858
"A reading from
a letter of St. John."

77
00:04:20,235 --> 00:04:23,196
We're afraid that we
will never escape our past,

78
00:04:23,863 --> 00:04:26,697
and we're afraid
of what the future will bring.

79
00:04:26,699 --> 00:04:30,075
We're afraid that we will not get
into the college of our choice.

80
00:04:30,077 --> 00:04:32,995
We're afraid we won't be loved,

81
00:04:32,997 --> 00:04:36,040
we won't be liked,
we won't succeed.

82
00:04:36,042 --> 00:04:39,210
Here are the classics...
St. Augustine, of course,

83
00:04:39,212 --> 00:04:41,754
Aquinas, my favorite,
Kierkegaard...

84
00:04:41,756 --> 00:04:45,299
Oh, wait until
you hear his love story.

85
00:04:45,301 --> 00:04:49,054
It will make you swoon.

86
00:04:52,309 --> 00:04:55,059
And the coming
of our Savior, Jesus Christ.

87
00:04:55,061 --> 00:05:00,232
For the kingdom, the power, and
the glory are yours, now and forever.

88
00:05:00,234 --> 00:05:01,816
Amen.

89
00:05:01,818 --> 00:05:05,112
Some of the students
were disturbed by your posters.

90
00:05:05,114 --> 00:05:10,074
It's just a bird head
on a lady body, or vice versa.

91
00:05:10,076 --> 00:05:11,745
I think it's a little upsetting.

92
00:05:11,747 --> 00:05:13,954
It's my tradition
to run for office.

93
00:05:13,956 --> 00:05:15,832
Don't worry. I won't win.

94
00:05:15,834 --> 00:05:17,959
That's not what
I'm worried about.

95
00:05:17,961 --> 00:05:20,754
This won't mess
with my scholarship, will it?

96
00:05:20,756 --> 00:05:22,716
No. You're okay there.

97
00:05:24,843 --> 00:05:27,093
You have a performative streak,
I think.

98
00:05:27,095 --> 00:05:29,344
Yeah, I think that too.

99
00:05:29,346 --> 00:05:31,430
Maybe you would enjoy
theater arts.

100
00:05:31,432 --> 00:05:34,476
They're having auditions
for the fall musical.

101
00:05:34,478 --> 00:05:36,101
Do we have that here?

102
00:05:36,103 --> 00:05:38,271
It's a collaborative effort
with the men at Xavier.

103
00:05:38,273 --> 00:05:40,647
How am I a senior
and not know we have that?

104
00:05:40,649 --> 00:05:44,028
Perhaps you haven't always been
an active part of this community.

105
00:05:45,530 --> 00:05:50,495
They do a fall musical and a spring play,
and from what I hear, it's a real blast.

106
00:05:51,161 --> 00:05:53,787
What I'd really like
is to be on Math Olympiad.

107
00:05:53,789 --> 00:05:56,124
But math isn't something
you're terribly strong in.

108
00:05:57,168 --> 00:05:59,417
That we know of yet.

109
00:06:03,548 --> 00:06:05,342
- There you go.
- Thanks.

110
00:06:06,260 --> 00:06:08,596
"Julie" doesn't
need to be in quotes.

111
00:06:09,097 --> 00:06:11,390
- But it's not my real name.
- It's not the same thing.

112
00:06:12,767 --> 00:06:17,352
I'm not sure you're right.

113
00:06:20,774 --> 00:06:22,109
I love this neighborhood.

114
00:06:23,027 --> 00:06:24,404
Yeah, it's so beautiful.

115
00:06:26,114 --> 00:06:28,156
If I lived here, I would
definitely have my wedding

116
00:06:28,158 --> 00:06:29,865
in the backyard.

117
00:06:29,867 --> 00:06:33,245
I'd have friends over all the
time to study and eat snacks.

118
00:06:33,247 --> 00:06:37,626
I'd be like, "Mom, we're taking the
snacks upstairs to the TV room."

119
00:06:38,419 --> 00:06:40,045
I'd have my own bathroom.

120
00:06:41,672 --> 00:06:43,629
I can't stop you dicks
from hanging out here,

121
00:06:43,631 --> 00:06:45,339
but quit wrinkling
all the magazines!

122
00:06:45,341 --> 00:06:47,259
When I'm in this
store, I'm not your sister.

123
00:06:47,261 --> 00:06:49,927
I'm a customer, Miguel.
I'm always right.

124
00:06:49,929 --> 00:06:53,723
Ever since she moved in, your brother and
Shelly are becoming the same person.

125
00:06:53,725 --> 00:06:55,017
No way.

126
00:06:57,146 --> 00:06:59,103
Yeah, okay. Maybe.

127
00:06:59,105 --> 00:07:01,189
See, why don't I look like that?

128
00:07:01,191 --> 00:07:04,109
Yeah. Just once, I'd like to have
the song "New York Groove" playing

129
00:07:04,111 --> 00:07:05,736
and feel like it
really applies to my life.

130
00:07:05,738 --> 00:07:07,113
You've never even
been to New York.

131
00:07:07,115 --> 00:07:09,698
That's why I'm applying
to New York colleges.

132
00:07:09,700 --> 00:07:12,325
Do you know if Sarah Lawrence
is actually in the city?

133
00:07:12,327 --> 00:07:15,662
- Your parents would pay for that?
- Scholarships, financial aid...

134
00:07:15,664 --> 00:07:19,793
I'll figure it out. My mom thinks I can't
get in, but she is sorely mistaken.

135
00:07:20,170 --> 00:07:22,255
- What about terrorism?
- Don't be a Republican.

136
00:07:23,380 --> 00:07:25,505
Probably just gonna go to city college.

137
00:07:25,507 --> 00:07:28,176
Put the magazine back!

138
00:07:28,178 --> 00:07:30,344
Shit!

139
00:07:30,346 --> 00:07:33,806
- You doing okay, mama?
- Oh, yeah, that was terrifying, wasn't it?

140
00:07:33,808 --> 00:07:37,142
Thank God you were there. So I guess
we can't have pencils anymore.

141
00:07:37,144 --> 00:07:39,771
Yeah, just gotta go back to
quill tipped markers. Crayola.

142
00:07:39,773 --> 00:07:42,691
Right. Thank you. It's for you.
I got it for the baby.

143
00:07:42,693 --> 00:07:45,235
- I couldn't resist it.
- She loves pink.

144
00:07:45,237 --> 00:07:47,362
It's more for you and Andrea
than it is for the baby.

145
00:07:47,364 --> 00:07:49,114
I'm sorry
I didn't have time to wrap it.

146
00:07:49,116 --> 00:07:51,324
- No, it's perfect.
- Okay. Good.

147
00:07:51,326 --> 00:07:53,951
I'll see you tomorrow.
Or, I mean, later.

148
00:07:53,953 --> 00:07:55,578
- Thank you.
- Okay.

Did you know toothpaste

156
00:08:27,947 --> 00:08:32,158
- It's like sucking on a mint.
- Mike Kelly died.

157
00:08:32,160 --> 00:08:34,286
I didn't even know he was sick again.

158
00:08:34,662 --> 00:08:35,663
How old was he?

159
00:08:36,497 --> 00:08:37,871
Only 56.

160
00:08:37,873 --> 00:08:40,165
- Can Shelly and I get in there?
- In a minute, honey.

161
00:08:40,167 --> 00:08:42,585
- Dad and I are still in here.
- That's too young.

162
00:08:42,587 --> 00:08:45,547
- Lady Bird, you better be dressed.
- I am dressed.

163
00:08:45,549 --> 00:08:47,884
Yeah.
I'm gonna send them a note.

164
00:08:49,301 --> 00:08:53,053
Do you think that Shelly and Miguel
have sex on the pullout couch?

165
00:08:53,055 --> 00:08:54,515
Oh, yeah.

166
00:08:57,561 --> 00:09:00,520
- Why can't I just make the eggs?
- Because you take too long,

167
00:09:00,522 --> 00:09:02,772
you make a big mess, and I have
to clean the whole thing up.

168
00:09:02,774 --> 00:09:04,232
Eggs aren't good
for the environment anyways.

169
00:09:04,234 --> 00:09:05,483
- What?
- You heard her.

170
00:09:05,485 --> 00:09:06,778
Eat quickly, please.

171
00:09:08,781 --> 00:09:09,822
Look at all these pictures. Every
newspaper looks like USA Today.

172
00:09:09,824 --> 00:09:12,533
Shelly and I are trying to be
vegan, hence the soy milk.

173
00:09:12,535 --> 00:09:13,700
You wear leather jackets.

174
00:09:13,702 --> 00:09:15,453
But they're vintage, so they
don't support the industry.

175
00:09:15,455 --> 00:09:17,121
They aren't done.
There's white stuff.

176
00:09:17,123 --> 00:09:18,414
You know how much
you love Brambles?

177
00:09:18,416 --> 00:09:19,582
Pigs are smarter than him even.

178
00:09:19,584 --> 00:09:21,876
I never thought Brambles
was a genius, okay?

179
00:09:21,878 --> 00:09:24,712
- Mom, the eggs are not done.
- Fine. Make your own fucking eggs.

180
00:09:24,714 --> 00:09:26,713
I wanted to.
You won't let me.

181
00:09:26,715 --> 00:09:28,466
- Your sister doesn't like me.
- I'm hungry!

182
00:09:28,468 --> 00:09:31,469
- She does.
- You had your chance. Going to bed.

183
00:09:33,682 --> 00:09:35,931
Did you know
that Alanis Morissette

184
00:09:35,933 --> 00:09:38,225
wrote this song
in only ten minutes?

185
00:09:38,227 --> 00:09:40,728
I believe it.

186
00:09:40,730 --> 00:09:45,358
So, I'm applying
to a couple East Coast schools.

187
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:48,612
I need you to help me with the financial
aid applications, but Mom can't know.

188
00:09:48,614 --> 00:09:51,698
We...
Aren't they quite expensive?

189
00:09:51,700 --> 00:09:54,617
First, yes.
That's why financial aid.

190
00:09:54,619 --> 00:09:56,536
Second, I have to get in first.

191
00:09:56,538 --> 00:09:58,537
Mom won't be happy about it.

192
00:09:58,539 --> 00:10:01,250
Which is why I don't want to
fight about it before I have to.

193
00:10:02,418 --> 00:10:04,419
- Just pull over here.
- Are you sure?

194
00:10:04,421 --> 00:10:07,546
- I can drive you to the front.
- No. This is fine. I like to walk.

195
00:10:08,675 --> 00:10:10,968
Well, I love you.

196
00:10:10,970 --> 00:10:13,429
So,
what do you think about college?

197
00:10:13,431 --> 00:10:15,934
- See what I can do.
- Thanks, Dad.

198
00:10:16,351 --> 00:10:18,186
I love you too.
Have a good day at work.

199
00:10:18,937 --> 00:10:23,105
Hey, I'm like Keith Richards.
I'm just happy to be anywhere.

200
00:10:23,107 --> 00:10:28,319
♪ And what it all
comes down to ♪

201
00:10:28,321 --> 00:10:30,570
♪ Is that I haven't got it all
Figured out just yet ♪

202
00:10:30,572 --> 00:10:31,739
Hey, bitch.

203
00:10:31,741 --> 00:10:34,075
- Hey.
- All right, girls.

204
00:10:34,077 --> 00:10:36,368
- Hope you like pickles.
- Thanks, Uncle Matt.

205
00:10:36,370 --> 00:10:39,413
- Sweet.
- He's not your uncle.

206
00:10:39,415 --> 00:10:41,498
Just something I'm trying out.
Bye, Mom.

207
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:42,458
- Bye.
- Love you.

208
00:10:42,460 --> 00:10:43,628
Bye. I love you.

209
00:10:44,462 --> 00:10:46,089
- Your mom really likes you.
- Yeah.

210
00:10:46,881 --> 00:10:48,968
- I just keep getting fatter.
- Me too.

211
00:10:50,218 --> 00:10:51,969
- Matt's awesome.
- Yeah.

212
00:10:51,971 --> 00:10:54,265
I hope he marries my mom.
That would be so nice.

213
00:10:54,890 --> 00:10:56,641
He promised me his old car
when I turn 18.

214
00:10:57,392 --> 00:11:00,101
Ugh! That car should be illegal.

215
00:11:00,103 --> 00:11:02,520
Jenna Walton's not doing
any off-roading.

216
00:11:02,522 --> 00:11:04,148
She just goes to Pavilions.

217
00:11:04,150 --> 00:11:07,525
I heard Jenna Walton
has a tanning bed in her house.

218
00:11:07,527 --> 00:11:09,610
She is so pretty.

219
00:11:09,612 --> 00:11:11,866
Her skin is luminous.

220
00:11:12,533 --> 00:11:13,701
Maybe we should try tanning.

221
00:11:14,660 --> 00:11:17,326
Yeah.

222
00:11:17,328 --> 00:11:20,205
...in the tub...

223
00:11:20,207 --> 00:11:23,500
I scoot myself under,
just like now, like this,

224
00:11:23,502 --> 00:11:26,462
and then the water just... whoop.

225
00:11:26,464 --> 00:11:30,467
Schwoop.

226
00:11:30,469 --> 00:11:31,927
Ooh, you're so gross!

227
00:11:32,845 --> 00:11:35,306
I think I figured it out when I
was, like, three or something.

228
00:11:36,933 --> 00:11:39,933
I take the showerhead...

229
00:11:39,935 --> 00:11:41,351
Oh, my God...

230
00:11:41,353 --> 00:11:43,355
Embarrassing, I use that.

231
00:11:44,690 --> 00:11:46,526
I don't know if mine
is the right kind though.

232
00:11:47,651 --> 00:11:49,986
Maybe it's different when you
actually have a penis in there.

233
00:11:49,988 --> 00:11:51,987
Like, it's more intense.

234
00:11:51,989 --> 00:11:54,741
Mine was pretty intense, I think.

235
00:11:54,743 --> 00:11:56,951
You're not supposed to
eat the wafers.

236
00:11:56,953 --> 00:11:59,328
They're not consecrated.

237
00:12:03,668 --> 00:12:09,756
Being alive

238
00:12:09,758 --> 00:12:11,759
Okay. Christine.

239
00:12:11,761 --> 00:12:14,428
- Lady Bird.
- Is that your given name?

240
00:12:14,430 --> 00:12:17,097
- Yeah.
- Why is it in quotes?

241
00:12:17,099 --> 00:12:20,059
Well, I gave it to myself.
It's given to me, by me.

242
00:12:20,061 --> 00:12:22,979
Okay. Take it away, Lady Bird.

243
00:12:23,355 --> 00:12:25,271
Everybody says don't,
everybody says don't

244
00:12:25,273 --> 00:12:27,607
Everybody says don't,
it isn't right

245
00:12:27,609 --> 00:12:30,319
Don't, it isn't nice

246
00:12:30,321 --> 00:12:32,070
Everybody says don't,
everybody says don't

247
00:12:32,072 --> 00:12:33,988
Everybody says
don't walk on the grass

248
00:12:33,990 --> 00:12:37,743
Rolling along

249
00:12:37,745 --> 00:12:40,830
Rolling along

250
00:12:40,832 --> 00:12:44,752
Make me a channel of your peace

251
00:12:45,586 --> 00:12:49,716
Where there is despair in life
Let me bring hope

252
00:12:50,759 --> 00:12:54,886
Where there is darkness,
only light

253
00:12:54,888 --> 00:12:59,933
And where there's sadness,
ever joy

254
00:13:01,477 --> 00:13:04,480
There are giants in the sky

255
00:13:05,732 --> 00:13:10,194
There are big, tall,
terrible giants in the sky

256
00:13:12,780 --> 00:13:14,740
When you're way up high
And you look below

257
00:13:14,742 --> 00:13:16,533
At the world you left
And the things you know

258
00:13:16,535 --> 00:13:18,494
Little more than a glance
Is enough to show you

259
00:13:18,496 --> 00:13:19,997
Just how small you are

260
00:13:21,665 --> 00:13:23,500
I see light on in your
room. Go to bed.

261
00:13:25,169 --> 00:13:27,920
- Congratulations.
- You too. We both got in.

262
00:13:27,922 --> 00:13:29,714
Everyone who auditioned got in.

263
00:13:29,716 --> 00:13:32,175
The part I got was basically
not getting in.

264
00:13:32,177 --> 00:13:34,509
I don't even know
how I got cast in my part.

265
00:13:34,511 --> 00:13:37,721
Me neither. I was the one who
had a dress and prepared a song.

266
00:13:37,723 --> 00:13:40,099
- I know.
- Now you're gonna be all romantic

267
00:13:40,101 --> 00:13:41,184
with Danny on stage.

268
00:13:41,186 --> 00:13:43,853
It's probably my only shot at
that, you know?

269
00:13:43,855 --> 00:13:46,733
- Do you have a pen?
- Yeah.

270
00:14:02,625 --> 00:14:04,207
- Mom.
- We don't need to buy that.

271
00:14:04,209 --> 00:14:07,001
It's only three dollars.
I'm having a hard week.

272
00:14:07,003 --> 00:14:09,379
Well, if you wanna read it, we can
go down to the public library.

273
00:14:09,381 --> 00:14:11,798
- I wanna read it in bed.
- That's something that rich people do.

274
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:12,884
We're not rich people.

275
00:14:16,805 --> 00:14:18,554
Stop.

276
00:14:18,556 --> 00:14:19,807
Stop it. Stop it.

277
00:14:22,352 --> 00:14:23,601
Listen, stop.

278
00:14:23,603 --> 00:14:24,769
Hey.

279
00:14:24,771 --> 00:14:25,937
Hi.

280
00:14:25,939 --> 00:14:28,190
Come here often?

281
00:14:28,192 --> 00:14:29,442
Excuse me?

282
00:14:29,444 --> 00:14:31,903
I'm Lady Bird. We're gonna be in
the musical together.

283
00:14:31,905 --> 00:14:35,198
Oh, yeah. I remember you.
You were wearing that dress.

284
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:38,034
Well, I just wanted to say, "What's
up," and I'll see you in rehearsal.

285
00:14:38,036 --> 00:14:40,912
Thanks. I'm super excited. You...
You live in the neighborhood?

286
00:14:40,914 --> 00:14:43,622
No. I'm from the wrong side of
the tracks.

287
00:14:43,624 --> 00:14:46,375
- Wh-What?
- Is that your family?

288
00:14:46,377 --> 00:14:47,377
Yeah.

289
00:14:48,003 --> 00:14:49,754
Wow. There's so many of you.

290
00:14:49,756 --> 00:14:52,756
Irish Catholic. It's hard to find a
girl to date that's not my cousin.

291
00:14:52,758 --> 00:14:56,720
Well, okay. You're gonna make
a great Franklin.

292
00:14:56,722 --> 00:15:00,390
Oh, thanks. I want my hair... or
his hair... to be curly, though.

293
00:15:00,392 --> 00:15:01,808
- Yeah.
- Like, um...

294
00:15:01,810 --> 00:15:03,559
Like Jim Morrison. Very '70s.

295
00:15:03,561 --> 00:15:05,978
- Like Jim Morrison. Exactly.
- Yeah.

296
00:15:05,980 --> 00:15:07,647
- Danny!
- Oh, I gotta go.

297
00:15:07,649 --> 00:15:09,860
Bye.

298
00:15:12,864 --> 00:15:14,780
Who is Jim Morrison again?

299
00:15:14,782 --> 00:15:16,741
He was in a rock band, moron.
The Doors.

300
00:15:16,743 --> 00:15:18,992
- I knew that.
- This is with your employee discount?

301
00:15:18,994 --> 00:15:21,161
Yeah. It's already included.

302
00:15:21,163 --> 00:15:23,289
Oh, my... Okay.

303
00:15:23,291 --> 00:15:24,998
- Ma.
- Ma.

304
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,208
- Mana.
- Mana.

305
00:15:27,210 --> 00:15:28,919
- Manala.
- Manala.

306
00:15:28,921 --> 00:15:32,256
Because it's not important to be right.
It's only important to be...

307
00:15:32,258 --> 00:15:33,591
- True.
- Exactly!

308
00:15:33,593 --> 00:15:35,718
Purple.

309
00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:37,469
Two.

310
00:15:37,471 --> 00:15:38,679
Two.

311
00:15:38,681 --> 00:15:40,890
Two.

312
00:15:45,730 --> 00:15:48,857
Yesterday is done

313
00:15:48,859 --> 00:15:52,902
See the pretty countryside

314
00:15:52,904 --> 00:15:56,198
To get our emotions going,
we're going to play

315
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:59,242
first one to cry wins

316
00:15:59,244 --> 00:16:02,787
Starting... now.

317
00:16:02,789 --> 00:16:04,207
I'm playing too.

318
00:16:04,792 --> 00:16:06,210
So is Miss Patty.

319
00:16:28,149 --> 00:16:30,483
Oh...

320
00:16:30,485 --> 00:16:33,446
I'm sorry.

321
00:16:33,779 --> 00:16:34,779
I'm sorry.

322
00:16:36,658 --> 00:16:39,701
I heard that before he
became a priest, he was married,

323
00:16:39,703 --> 00:16:43,120
and had a son named Etienne, who
died at 17 of a drug overdose,

324
00:16:43,122 --> 00:16:44,872
which maybe was a suicide.

325
00:16:44,874 --> 00:16:47,836
But my mom says same difference, if
you're that careless with your life.

326
00:16:48,877 --> 00:16:51,295
Oh, that's her. Gotta go.

327
00:16:51,297 --> 00:16:52,716
- Bye, guys.
- Bye.

328
00:16:57,178 --> 00:16:59,303
Oh, I almost forgot.

329
00:16:59,305 --> 00:17:04,017
I brought you these hot rollers...
for your Jim Morrison hair.

330
00:17:04,019 --> 00:17:06,979
- Thank you so much.
- You're welcome.

331
00:17:06,981 --> 00:17:09,817
- You'll have to show me how to use them.
- It would be my pleasure.

332
00:17:12,278 --> 00:17:18,574
They look like sperms.

333
00:17:18,576 --> 00:17:21,577
I ju... I just remembered,
I had a dream about you.

334
00:17:21,579 --> 00:17:23,369
- Really?
- Yeah.

335
00:17:23,371 --> 00:17:26,414
- What... What happened?
- Um, we were...

336
00:17:26,416 --> 00:17:28,625
we were flying to Disneyland
on a giant carrot.

337
00:17:28,627 --> 00:17:30,961
That's awesome.

338
00:17:30,963 --> 00:17:33,380
- I love Disneyland.
- Yeah. Me too.

339
00:17:33,382 --> 00:17:36,175
- I think it's kind of scary, but...
- Mm.

340
00:17:36,177 --> 00:17:37,512
...I also love it.

341
00:17:38,429 --> 00:17:40,805
So, everybody clear
on applying rules of exponents?

342
00:17:40,807 --> 00:17:43,223
You guys with me?
Don't leave me hanging.

343
00:17:43,225 --> 00:17:47,061
Give me a nod. That's good. Maybe
even a verbal confirmation.

344
00:17:47,063 --> 00:17:47,936
Yes.

345
00:17:47,938 --> 00:17:50,022
Aha! Thank you.
That's what I like to hear.

346
00:17:50,024 --> 00:17:53,401
All right. So I'm gonna be passing
back your graded quizzes.

347
00:17:53,403 --> 00:17:56,445
I urge you to find the problems where
you went wrong and work them out.

348
00:17:56,447 --> 00:17:58,572
Good job, Jules.

349
00:17:58,574 --> 00:18:01,658
I can tell from your work you even
understood the ones you missed.

350
00:18:07,708 --> 00:18:09,376
Suck a dick.

351
00:18:09,378 --> 00:18:11,418
I like "Jules."

352
00:18:11,420 --> 00:18:15,090
I just don't get why I'm not good at math.
My dad is really good in math.

353
00:18:15,092 --> 00:18:17,342
Even Miguel has a math degree.

354
00:18:17,344 --> 00:18:20,096
Maybe it's your mom's fault.

355
00:18:28,688 --> 00:18:30,940
- You lose! Point Julie!
- No. Look.

356
00:18:33,694 --> 00:18:35,571
- Wish me luck.
- Luck.

357
00:18:40,700 --> 00:18:43,034
Hey, wanna dance?

358
00:18:43,036 --> 00:18:45,245
Hell, yeah.

359
00:18:50,254 --> 00:18:53,924
Six inches for the Holy Spirit.

360
00:19:10,565 --> 00:19:12,441
That's us.

361
00:19:12,443 --> 00:19:15,151
- Oh, uh, no. My mom's coming.
- No, she's not.

362
00:19:15,153 --> 00:19:17,070
- Yeah, she is.
- The plan was to sleep over at my house.

363
00:19:17,072 --> 00:19:18,072
No. It's fine.

364
00:19:18,991 --> 00:19:20,406
Okay. Bye.

365
00:19:20,408 --> 00:19:21,408
Bye.

366
00:19:23,161 --> 00:19:24,203
Hey, Matt.

367
00:19:32,005 --> 00:19:33,547
Have you ever been
out of the country?

368
00:19:34,423 --> 00:19:35,883
- When I was little.
- Mm.

369
00:19:37,177 --> 00:19:40,636
My... My dad had a job
that took him to Brazil.

370
00:19:40,638 --> 00:19:42,429
I remember from the pictures.

371
00:19:42,431 --> 00:19:44,474
My dream to...

372
00:19:44,476 --> 00:19:47,851
- Oh. Sorry.
- No. No, you go.

373
00:19:47,853 --> 00:19:49,936
I've never been
out of the country.

374
00:19:49,938 --> 00:19:52,689
It's, uh... It's my dream
to go to Paris.

375
00:19:52,691 --> 00:19:55,236
Ohh. Paris.

376
00:19:55,986 --> 00:19:58,111
That's why I'm taking French.

377
00:19:58,113 --> 00:20:01,450
My mom said French
wasn't useful.

378
00:20:01,784 --> 00:20:03,995
It is if you wanna go to Paris.

379
00:20:12,170 --> 00:20:14,963
I still don't know how to use
those rollers that you gave me.

380
00:20:14,965 --> 00:20:16,881
Oh...
Oh, it's so easy.

381
00:20:16,883 --> 00:20:20,093
- Um, so, after they heat up...
- Mm-hmm?

382
00:20:20,095 --> 00:20:23,472
...you... you take your hair

383
00:20:23,474 --> 00:20:27,895
and you twist the hair like
this, and...

384
00:20:42,451 --> 00:20:45,035
Larry,
how long will this hold us?

385
00:20:45,037 --> 00:20:47,956
- I don't know.
- Well, somebody's gotta know.

386
00:20:50,794 --> 00:20:51,795
I'm not sure.

387
00:20:53,171 --> 00:20:54,670
What happens if somebody
gets in an accident?

388
00:20:54,672 --> 00:20:57,506
Uh, the severance
package expires all at once.

389
00:20:57,508 --> 00:21:00,217
Not within the calendar year.

390
00:21:00,219 --> 00:21:02,929
- Is she home?
- Maybe just leave it tonight.

391
00:21:02,931 --> 00:21:05,724
No, she knows better. She can't
sneak around like this.

392
00:21:05,726 --> 00:21:07,225
Marion.

393
00:21:07,227 --> 00:21:09,143
- You can't leave your room like this.
- I didn't.

394
00:21:09,145 --> 00:21:10,769
None of these things were put
away right.

395
00:21:10,771 --> 00:21:12,980
- They aren't nice. Christine, now.
- I put my clothes away.

396
00:21:12,982 --> 00:21:14,356
- My name is Lady Bird.
- Don't lie to me.

397
00:21:14,358 --> 00:21:17,110
This uniform... This is gonna
look like trash on Monday.

398
00:21:17,112 --> 00:21:20,405
This isn't right. We can't treat
our clothes like this.

399
00:21:20,407 --> 00:21:22,365
I don't know what
your wealthy friends do...

400
00:21:22,367 --> 00:21:24,662
Why do you care
what I do to my clothes?

401
00:21:27,123 --> 00:21:30,416
Your father doesn't have a job.

402
00:21:30,418 --> 00:21:32,459
He lost his job.

403
00:21:32,461 --> 00:21:34,661
Do you need him to come in here
and explain that to you?

404
00:21:35,256 --> 00:21:37,547
Of course, he probably wouldn't
anyway. He's Mr. Nice Guy,

405
00:21:37,549 --> 00:21:39,549
- and I always have to be the bad guy.
- Can we please just talk...

406
00:21:39,551 --> 00:21:40,968
- It can't look like a rag,
- ...about this tomorrow?

407
00:21:40,970 --> 00:21:42,553
Because that makes us
look like rags.

408
00:21:42,555 --> 00:21:44,638
You wanna know the truth?
Here's the truth.

409
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:46,849
Some of your friends' fathers
could employ your father,

410
00:21:46,851 --> 00:21:50,186
and they're not gonna do it if it
looks like his family is trash.

411
00:21:50,188 --> 00:21:58,189
You understand?

412
00:21:58,989 --> 00:22:03,075
Didn't you ever go to sleep without
putting all your clothes away perfectly?

413
00:22:03,077 --> 00:22:04,327
Like even once?

414
00:22:04,702 --> 00:22:06,663
And don't you wish your mom
hadn't gotten angry?

415
00:22:09,249 --> 00:22:15,796
My mother was an
abusive alcoholic.

416
00:22:15,798 --> 00:22:19,883
So, I understand you're not
interested in any Catholic colleges.

417
00:22:19,885 --> 00:22:20,885
No way.

418
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:24,513
Sorry. But yes, no way.

419
00:22:24,515 --> 00:22:27,516
Then you'll be applying to UCs
and state schools.

420
00:22:27,518 --> 00:22:31,311
Yeah, but also those East Coast
liberal arts schools like Yale,

421
00:22:31,313 --> 00:22:33,897
but not Yale, because I probably
couldn't get in.

422
00:22:37,820 --> 00:22:39,280
You definitely couldn't get in.

423
00:22:40,490 --> 00:22:42,280
Part of my job
is to help you be realistic.

424
00:22:42,282 --> 00:22:44,325
Yeah. It seems like
everyone's job.

425
00:22:44,327 --> 00:22:47,412
Your SAT scores are strangely
very good.

426
00:22:47,414 --> 00:22:52,124
I had placed some calls to local alumni
of the schools you're interested in,

427
00:22:52,126 --> 00:22:54,501
but unfortunately,
all the interviews are taken.

428
00:22:54,503 --> 00:22:56,421
So what does that mean?

429
00:22:56,423 --> 00:23:00,218
It means you'll have to get in
on how you look on paper.

430
00:23:01,845 --> 00:23:06,931
Dreams don't die,
so keep an eye on your dream

431
00:23:06,933 --> 00:23:09,933
And before you know where
you are, there you are

432
00:23:09,935 --> 00:23:17,936
All right. Stop, stop, stop.

433
00:23:21,866 --> 00:23:23,574
Should we go home?

434
00:23:23,576 --> 00:23:26,326
My mom is always mad.

435
00:23:26,328 --> 00:23:29,538
Doesn't matter if I get home late.
She'll be mad at me anyway.

436
00:23:29,540 --> 00:23:33,377
- Your mom's hard on you.
- Yeah, well, she loves me a lot.

437
00:23:36,547 --> 00:23:37,882
Pick a star for us.

438
00:23:40,967 --> 00:23:43,301
That one. Right there.

439
00:23:43,303 --> 00:23:45,846
Next to the bright one, and then
the dim one. You see it?

440
00:23:45,848 --> 00:23:46,848
Yeah.

441
00:23:48,350 --> 00:23:49,643
That's our star.

442
00:23:52,313 --> 00:23:55,022
You know...

443
00:23:55,024 --> 00:23:58,151
you can touch my boobs, right?

444
00:23:58,153 --> 00:24:02,240
I know. It's just that
I respect you too much for that.

445
00:24:03,407 --> 00:24:06,451
Cool. Awesome.

446
00:24:06,453 --> 00:24:09,119
I totally get that. Thank you.

447
00:24:09,121 --> 00:24:10,497
You're welcome.

448
00:24:10,499 --> 00:24:13,500
If you had boobs,
I wouldn't touch them either.

449
00:24:13,502 --> 00:24:15,503
I respect you so much...

450
00:24:16,838 --> 00:24:19,590
because I love you.

451
00:24:20,007 --> 00:24:21,092
I love you too.

452
00:24:27,516 --> 00:24:31,394
- Let's name our star Claude.
- That's pretentious, don't you think?

453
00:24:31,396 --> 00:24:36,022
It's French.
What should we name it?

454
00:24:36,024 --> 00:24:38,276
Bruce.

455
00:24:40,029 --> 00:24:42,448
- I love you!
- I love you.

456
00:24:45,368 --> 00:24:49,453
Bruce.

457
00:24:49,455 --> 00:24:52,373
It's normal
to not touch a penis.

458
00:24:52,375 --> 00:24:54,082
I have to go to class.

459
00:24:54,084 --> 00:24:56,210
- But I have free period.
- I need to pass history.

460
00:24:56,212 --> 00:24:58,337
I think we're done with the
learning portion of high school.

461
00:24:58,339 --> 00:25:00,004
- I'm gonna go.
- No.

462
00:25:00,006 --> 00:25:01,549
- Mm-hmm.
- I hate being alone.

463
00:25:01,551 --> 00:25:02,719
Bye! Love you!

464
00:25:37,880 --> 00:25:41,716
Did Danny say whether his grandmother
has a formal Thanksgiving?

465
00:25:41,718 --> 00:25:45,261
I don't know. There are a lot of
kids, but she lives in the Fab 40s.

466
00:25:45,263 --> 00:25:48,139
Oh, well, your dad and I went to a
dinner party once in that neighborhood.

467
00:25:48,141 --> 00:25:50,768
The CEO of ISC. That was pretty
formal.

468
00:25:52,394 --> 00:25:54,145
You're not going to a funeral.

469
00:25:54,147 --> 00:25:57,273
Well, I don't know. What says
"rich people Thanksgiving"?

470
00:25:57,275 --> 00:26:00,359
I just think it's such a shame that
you're spending your last Thanksgiving

471
00:26:00,361 --> 00:26:02,445
with a family you've never met
instead of us, but...

472
00:26:02,447 --> 00:26:04,532
I know.
I guess you want it that way.

473
00:26:06,116 --> 00:26:08,325
- Are you tired?
- No.

474
00:26:08,327 --> 00:26:11,454
- Hey, Marion.
- Hey, Joyce. Hey, how's the baby?

475
00:26:11,456 --> 00:26:14,331
- She's crawling.
- No! I wanna see a picture at checkout.

476
00:26:14,333 --> 00:26:15,917
- Okay.
- Okay.

477
00:26:15,919 --> 00:26:18,461
- 'Cause if you're tired, we can sit down.
- I'm not tired.

478
00:26:18,463 --> 00:26:21,103
Oh, okay. I just couldn't tell
because you were dragging your feet.

479
00:26:21,926 --> 00:26:23,010
Well, I just couldn't tell.

480
00:26:24,010 --> 00:26:25,552
Why didn't you just say,
"Pick up your feet"?

481
00:26:25,554 --> 00:26:26,553
I didn't know if you were tired.

482
00:26:26,555 --> 00:26:28,972
- You were being passive-aggressive.
- No, I wasn't.

483
00:26:28,974 --> 00:26:30,640
- You are so infuriating.
- Please stop yelling.

484
00:26:30,642 --> 00:26:34,229
- I'm not yelling. Oh! Perfect!
- Honey, do you love it?

485
00:26:55,669 --> 00:27:00,880
So, because my grade book has...
disappeared, here's what we're gonna do.

486
00:27:00,882 --> 00:27:03,298
I'm gonna count on you
to reconstruct it, okay?

487
00:27:03,300 --> 00:27:05,509
Now, I know you all know
your grades better than anybody.

488
00:27:05,511 --> 00:27:09,265
I have a general idea, but this is
all about the honor code right now.

489
00:27:10,307 --> 00:27:11,932
Hi. A-minus.

490
00:27:11,934 --> 00:27:13,892
Pretty sure it was an A.

491
00:27:13,894 --> 00:27:16,228
I'm not, but okay.

492
00:27:16,230 --> 00:27:18,650
It was. Trust me,
I know talent when I see it.

493
00:27:20,317 --> 00:27:22,194
You're welcome. Thank you.

494
00:27:25,699 --> 00:27:27,366
Hey, I think B.

495
00:27:28,451 --> 00:27:31,996
I thought it was more like B-minus,
maybe even C-plus territory?

496
00:27:31,998 --> 00:27:34,457
No, because I did really well
on the last quiz.

497
00:27:34,459 --> 00:27:36,667
Oh. I seem to remember you
doing only slightly better.

498
00:27:36,669 --> 00:27:38,296
That brought my average
up to a B.

499
00:27:40,338 --> 00:27:42,466
Okay. B it is.

500
00:27:43,468 --> 00:27:46,137
It's your honor.

501
00:27:46,554 --> 00:27:48,511
Lady Bird, your lover awaits!

502
00:27:48,513 --> 00:27:51,515
- Hello, Danny! The famous Danny!
- Hi.

503
00:27:51,517 --> 00:27:53,476
- Aw!
- Oh-ho-ho!

504
00:27:53,478 --> 00:27:55,728
Aren't you adorable?

505
00:27:55,730 --> 00:27:57,854
- Larry, isn't he adorable?
- He's adorable.

506
00:27:57,856 --> 00:28:01,441
You're driving her and
everything. Wow.

507
00:28:01,443 --> 00:28:03,568
Yeah, well, thank you
for letting Lady Bird come

508
00:28:03,570 --> 00:28:05,528
to my grandmother's
Thanksgiving, Mrs. McPherson.

509
00:28:05,530 --> 00:28:07,948
No. No more politeness.
Call me Marion.

510
00:28:07,950 --> 00:28:09,992
Oh. Well, nice to meet you,
Mr. McPherson.

511
00:28:09,994 --> 00:28:12,578
Please, call me
Mr. Larry McPherson.

512
00:28:12,580 --> 00:28:14,581
Larry. Sit down,
Danny.

513
00:28:14,583 --> 00:28:17,041
- Can I get you something to drink?
- Oh, no, I'm fine.

514
00:28:17,043 --> 00:28:21,046
Hey, I'm Miguel, the brother. I think
Lady Bird wants to make an entrance.

515
00:28:21,048 --> 00:28:22,838
She's mad we don't have
a spiral staircase.

516
00:28:24,635 --> 00:28:26,135
- Shelly.
- What?

517
00:28:26,677 --> 00:28:28,678
- Is my name.
- Oh. Hi.

518
00:28:28,680 --> 00:28:31,014
Hi.

519
00:28:31,016 --> 00:28:34,308
It's funny. On my way over here,
I went over the train tracks.

520
00:28:34,310 --> 00:28:36,478
- Oh, you took H Street.
- Right. And so,

521
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:39,230
Lady Bird always says that she lives
on the wrong side of the tracks,

522
00:28:39,232 --> 00:28:41,566
but I always thought
that was like a metaphor.

523
00:28:41,568 --> 00:28:44,777
- Oh.
- But there are actual train tracks.

524
00:28:45,865 --> 00:28:48,324
Oh, hi.
You look amazing!

525
00:28:48,326 --> 00:28:51,618
- What the hell is in the duffel bag?
- Don't worry about it. Jeez.

526
00:28:51,620 --> 00:28:55,541
- My grandmother will love that dress.
- Okay.

527
00:29:04,091 --> 00:29:06,509
Wait.

528
00:29:06,511 --> 00:29:08,719
- This is your grandma's house?
- Yeah.

529
00:29:08,721 --> 00:29:12,723
- Oh, my God!
- Oh, Danny! You're late.

530
00:29:12,725 --> 00:29:15,601
Oh, uh, well, thank you so much
for having us.

531
00:29:15,603 --> 00:29:17,228
- This is Lady Bird.
- Hi.

532
00:29:17,230 --> 00:29:20,064
Hi, honey.
Been anxious to meet you.

533
00:29:20,066 --> 00:29:21,816
Your house is my favorite

534
00:29:21,818 --> 00:29:23,652
- in all East Sacramento.
- Oh, thank you.

535
00:29:23,654 --> 00:29:26,070
Oh, my God!

536
00:29:26,072 --> 00:29:29,450
- Is this a joke?
- No.

537
00:29:29,452 --> 00:29:31,952
- Pull these out...
- Oh...

538
00:29:31,954 --> 00:29:34,037
Almost done. Do you like it?

539
00:29:34,039 --> 00:29:38,166
Lovely. I love it. Would you mind
doing the whole table for me?

540
00:29:38,168 --> 00:29:39,835
Okay.

541
00:29:39,837 --> 00:29:42,631
Dreams that will explode

542
00:29:43,339 --> 00:29:46,299
Waking up the countryside

543
00:29:46,301 --> 00:29:48,594
- How do you know when it's working?
- You'll know.

544
00:29:48,596 --> 00:29:50,596
- It's not working.
- It's not?

545
00:29:50,598 --> 00:29:52,556
- No.
- My sister said this was premium.

546
00:29:52,558 --> 00:29:55,475
- I'm working.
- I'm... I'm working too.

547
00:29:55,477 --> 00:29:56,770
No.

548
00:29:57,772 --> 00:29:59,937
I can't feel my arms.

549
00:29:59,939 --> 00:30:01,567
You're working.

550
00:30:02,401 --> 00:30:05,194
I'm no easy A

551
00:30:05,196 --> 00:30:06,197
Quiet...

552
00:30:07,657 --> 00:30:09,991
If Danny and I get married,
and then his grandma died,

553
00:30:09,993 --> 00:30:12,367
I'd inherit the dream house.

554
00:30:12,369 --> 00:30:14,369
Wouldn't his parents get it?

555
00:30:14,371 --> 00:30:16,164
Oh, yeah.
We'd have to kill them,

556
00:30:16,166 --> 00:30:17,958
and we'd have to kill
his older brothers too.

557
00:30:32,808 --> 00:30:35,433
Yeah

558
00:30:35,435 --> 00:30:37,311
- Whoo!
- Whoo!

559
00:30:39,273 --> 00:30:41,648
Where's Mr. Bruno's wife?

560
00:31:01,212 --> 00:31:02,588
- How's it going?
- Okay.

561
00:31:03,672 --> 00:31:07,383
Mom, we...
we can't really talk right now.

562
00:31:10,178 --> 00:31:15,183
Well, happy Thanksgiving.
We missed you, Lady Bird.

563
00:31:15,185 --> 00:31:17,060
Try to run, try to hide,
try to keep it inside

564
00:31:19,648 --> 00:31:21,773
- Bye.
- Bye, Birdy.

565
00:31:21,775 --> 00:31:23,415
- Bye, Shelly.
- Bye, Shelly.

566
00:31:26,863 --> 00:31:29,572
Why does that cigarette look
so weird?

567
00:31:29,574 --> 00:31:31,034
Like, not like a cigarette?

568
00:31:32,910 --> 00:31:34,162
'Cause it's a clove.

569
00:31:42,588 --> 00:31:50,342
Lick your lips.
That's why they're sweet.

570
00:31:50,344 --> 00:31:53,014
Your mom was really sad you weren't
here tonight for Thanksgiving.

571
00:31:54,100 --> 00:31:57,935
Yeah, well, she hates me.

572
00:31:57,937 --> 00:32:02,732
She has a big heart, your mom.

573
00:32:02,734 --> 00:32:05,528
She took me in after my parents
freaked out about...

574
00:32:06,862 --> 00:32:09,074
whatever, premarital sex.

575
00:32:12,285 --> 00:32:13,660
I admire her.

576
00:32:32,472 --> 00:32:33,554
Pray for us!

577
00:32:33,556 --> 00:32:34,931
Save Jesus in our heart!

578
00:32:34,933 --> 00:32:36,101
Forever!

579
00:32:39,646 --> 00:32:43,148
Flying through the countryside

580
00:32:43,150 --> 00:32:45,820
Merrily we roll along,
roll along

581
00:32:46,987 --> 00:32:50,072
Catching a dream

582
00:32:50,074 --> 00:32:52,533
Stop fighting! Stop fighting!

583
00:32:52,535 --> 00:32:53,619
Hey!

584
00:32:55,996 --> 00:32:57,955
Hey, old friends

585
00:32:57,957 --> 00:33:00,373
How do we stay old friends

586
00:33:00,375 --> 00:33:05,588
It started out like a song

587
00:33:07,008 --> 00:33:08,882
Me and you

588
00:33:08,884 --> 00:33:10,927
Me and you

589
00:33:10,929 --> 00:33:12,010
Me and you

590
00:33:17,602 --> 00:33:19,143
That's true. There she is.

591
00:33:19,145 --> 00:33:20,894
- Hi.
- Jules. Wow.

592
00:33:20,896 --> 00:33:22,397
- You were so good.
- Thank you.

593
00:33:22,399 --> 00:33:24,106
I couldn't believe that.
This is my wife Becky.

594
00:33:24,108 --> 00:33:27,110
Becky this is Jules. She's one
of my brightest students.

595
00:33:27,112 --> 00:33:29,362
- It's so-so nice to meet you.
- It's nice to meet you too.

596
00:33:29,364 --> 00:33:31,531
- How we doing? Feeling a little better?
- A little tired.

597
00:33:31,533 --> 00:33:33,158
- Yeah.
- Okay. All right, I gotta get her home.

598
00:33:33,160 --> 00:33:35,576
We got the little one, but that
was really great, Jules.

599
00:33:35,578 --> 00:33:36,579
Thank you.

600
00:33:37,581 --> 00:33:45,582
Congratulations.

601
00:33:53,055 --> 00:33:56,055
He didn't understand it.

602
00:34:06,068 --> 00:34:08,319
How long do you think you all will pee?

603
00:34:08,321 --> 00:34:09,944
I drank so much soda.

604
00:34:09,946 --> 00:34:11,821
- Fuck you.
- I just got my period.

605
00:34:11,823 --> 00:34:13,448
- Goddammit.
- Where're you going?

606
00:34:13,450 --> 00:34:14,970
There's never a line in the
men's room.

607
00:34:21,460 --> 00:34:22,666
Uh, I...

608
00:34:22,668 --> 00:34:24,001
Oh, my God.

They're really nice socks.

617
00:35:08,841 --> 00:35:11,133
They're expensive, actually.

618
00:35:11,135 --> 00:35:13,093
They wick moisture away from
your feet.

619
00:35:13,095 --> 00:35:15,053
My feet always have moisture.

620
00:35:15,055 --> 00:35:16,930
Mom, I love them.

621
00:35:16,932 --> 00:35:20,017
I'm sorry it's a small
Christmas. We wanted to...

622
00:35:20,019 --> 00:35:22,602
It's just a little
small this year.

623
00:35:22,604 --> 00:35:23,604
These are nice.

624
00:35:26,818 --> 00:35:29,276
- Do you like it?
- Look.

625
00:35:30,696 --> 00:35:32,529
- That's good.
- That's great.

626
00:35:32,531 --> 00:35:35,618
I had to get it.
It makes me laugh.

627
00:35:44,170 --> 00:35:45,170
Dad, come in.

628
00:35:49,007 --> 00:35:50,257
How'd you know it was me?

629
00:35:50,259 --> 00:35:51,632
Mom doesn't knock.

630
00:35:51,634 --> 00:35:53,803
No, she doesn't.

631
00:35:56,973 --> 00:36:00,058
Here they are. Your completed
financial aid applications.

632
00:36:00,060 --> 00:36:01,768
Thank you!

633
00:36:01,770 --> 00:36:04,147
- Merry Christmas.
- Thank you.

634
00:36:05,148 --> 00:36:07,190
Do you need money
for the applications?

635
00:36:07,192 --> 00:36:08,650
- I can help with that too.
- No. No.

636
00:36:08,652 --> 00:36:09,902
I've got that.

637
00:36:09,904 --> 00:36:11,695
Summer job's covered it.

638
00:36:11,697 --> 00:36:13,490
This is why
we have computer shut off time.

639
00:36:13,492 --> 00:36:14,772
- This is our room.
- Okay, okay.

640
00:36:16,660 --> 00:36:17,702
Just can you drive me to the post office
on Jade? It should still be open.

641
00:36:17,704 --> 00:36:21,080
Three, two, one.

642
00:36:21,082 --> 00:36:23,290
Happy New Year!

643
00:36:25,711 --> 00:36:27,086
Happy New Year!

644
00:36:31,383 --> 00:36:34,053
So you pull the nozzle out. You
tip it in.

645
00:36:49,568 --> 00:36:50,571
Hey.

646
00:36:51,571 --> 00:36:53,572
I-I like your band.

647
00:36:53,574 --> 00:36:55,116
Uh, with Jonah Ruiz,

648
00:36:55,118 --> 00:36:56,911
- Lenfance New?
- L'enfance Nue.

649
00:36:58,871 --> 00:37:03,123
Uh, well, I-I saw your
Thanksgiving show.

650
00:37:03,125 --> 00:37:04,791
My name's Lady Bird.

651
00:37:04,793 --> 00:37:06,168
That's weird. You shake hands.

652
00:37:06,170 --> 00:37:07,170
Yeah.

653
00:37:10,299 --> 00:37:14,009
I'm friends with Jenna and she's always
talking about how great your band is.

654
00:37:14,011 --> 00:37:15,679
So I wanted to check it out.

655
00:37:16,096 --> 00:37:17,931
- Yeah. Jenna's hella tight.
- Yeah.

656
00:37:18,516 --> 00:37:20,849
Maybe I'll see you at the Deuce
or something, huh?

657
00:37:20,851 --> 00:37:22,726
Sure. See you at the Deuce.

658
00:37:22,728 --> 00:37:24,228
Hey.

659
00:37:24,230 --> 00:37:25,603
I'm not paying you to flirt.

660
00:37:25,605 --> 00:37:27,983
I wasn't flirting.

661
00:37:27,985 --> 00:37:29,403
I wish you had been.

662
00:37:41,706 --> 00:37:43,789
A reading from the book
of Genesis.

663
00:37:43,791 --> 00:37:47,251
"The Lord took Abram outside
and said,

664
00:37:47,253 --> 00:37:49,922
'Look up at the sky
and count the stars if you can.'

665
00:37:50,256 --> 00:37:53,092
Just so, he added,
'Shall your descendants be.'

666
00:37:53,635 --> 00:37:55,885
Abram put his faith in the Lord.

667
00:37:55,887 --> 00:37:58,345
Who credited to him
as an act of righteousness."

668
00:38:06,732 --> 00:38:10,192
Okay, the first time we did it, it
was at his lake house last summer.

669
00:38:10,194 --> 00:38:14,029
- It was so funny.
- Oh, here you go.

670
00:38:14,031 --> 00:38:15,240
From Uncle Matt.

671
00:38:17,118 --> 00:38:18,701
I think he and my mom are fighting
so enjoy the lunches while you can.

672
00:38:18,703 --> 00:38:21,370
Oh, no thanks. I'm trying to
lose weight.

673
00:38:21,372 --> 00:38:22,373
Really?

674
00:38:23,917 --> 00:38:25,792
Sex is not a big deal. It's just
my mom called me during it.

675
00:38:25,794 --> 00:38:27,585
- Skirt check.
- Was on my cell phone.

676
00:38:27,587 --> 00:38:29,252
The one she got me for
emergencies.

677
00:38:29,254 --> 00:38:31,797
Did you pick up?

678
00:38:31,799 --> 00:38:34,174
Yeah. I was like, "Um, Mom, I
can't really talk right now."

679
00:38:36,136 --> 00:38:37,596
What was the emergency?

680
00:38:38,598 --> 00:38:41,223
- What?
- Uh, what was the emergency?

681
00:38:41,225 --> 00:38:43,601
- Oh, my great aunt died.
- I'm so sorry.

682
00:38:43,603 --> 00:38:45,604
She kinda did it to herself.

683
00:38:45,606 --> 00:38:47,939
Yeah. I don't know why you'd do
that if you're already so old.

684
00:38:47,941 --> 00:38:49,316
Ladies.

685
00:38:49,318 --> 00:38:50,444
Skirts.

686
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:55,947
I'm going to write you a
citation, Miss Walton.

687
00:38:55,949 --> 00:38:57,534
No more short skirts.

688
00:39:00,412 --> 00:39:02,831
Sarah Joan is all up in my junk.

689
00:39:04,166 --> 00:39:05,624
She's a cunt.

690
00:39:05,626 --> 00:39:07,376
Birdy, you like her.

691
00:39:07,378 --> 00:39:09,338
Yeah, but she's a cunt.

692
00:39:10,380 --> 00:39:12,924
I have an idea
of how to get Sarah Joan back.

693
00:39:13,925 --> 00:39:16,677
- How?
- You'll see this afternoon.

694
00:39:16,679 --> 00:39:19,346
No, we have auditions
this afternoon.

695
00:39:19,348 --> 00:39:24,352
Oh, right. I mean, uh, I don't
think I want to do the play.

696
00:39:24,354 --> 00:39:26,228
Meet me at the
teacher's parking lot at 3.

697
00:39:26,230 --> 00:39:28,607
- I'll have the materials.
- Okay.

698
00:39:29,442 --> 00:39:30,444
Wait, what was your name?

699
00:39:31,361 --> 00:39:32,361
Lady Bird.

700
00:39:33,363 --> 00:39:34,904
- Weird.
- Ladies.

701
00:39:34,906 --> 00:39:36,281
We have a decision to make.

702
00:39:36,283 --> 00:39:38,658
Prom themes. Top options so far,

703
00:39:38,660 --> 00:39:41,410
cities of the world,

704
00:39:41,412 --> 00:39:43,538
eternal flame, and movies.

705
00:39:45,207 --> 00:39:47,000
Oh, where is Father Leviatch?

706
00:39:47,002 --> 00:39:49,169
All right, let's have everyone
take a knee. Huh?

707
00:39:49,171 --> 00:39:51,089
- What?
- Cozy sit.

708
00:39:53,049 --> 00:39:55,091
Now, I know you all miss
Father Leviatch,

709
00:39:55,093 --> 00:39:57,096
and I can tell you that
the brothers do too.

710
00:39:58,097 --> 00:39:59,804
But I'm gonna give
this thing my best shot.

711
00:40:01,224 --> 00:40:03,684
Uh, now, usually
I'm the JV football coach,

712
00:40:03,686 --> 00:40:07,396
but from what I can see,
a play is a play.

713
00:40:07,398 --> 00:40:09,398
Where's Lady Bird?

714
00:40:09,400 --> 00:40:11,983
She's with her new best friend. She
thinks she's too cool for theater.

715
00:40:11,985 --> 00:40:13,943
If you can pull out
your-your scripts,

716
00:40:13,945 --> 00:40:16,237
I've assigned a number
to each of your roles.

717
00:40:16,239 --> 00:40:18,574
And, uh, I'm gonna put the
blocking up here on the board,

718
00:40:18,576 --> 00:40:22,702
and then if you guys can transcribe that
back in your play books, that'd be great.

719
00:40:22,704 --> 00:40:24,204
Who's playing what part?

720
00:40:24,206 --> 00:40:27,249
Uh, I had Miss Patty here assign
roles, since she knows you all.

721
00:40:27,251 --> 00:40:29,168
So, uh, call them out,
Miss Patty.

722
00:40:29,170 --> 00:40:31,378
Okay, uh, Prospero. Danny.

723
00:40:31,380 --> 00:40:33,383
Danny. Nice. That's role one.

724
00:40:36,095 --> 00:40:37,178
Wait. Where do you live?

725
00:40:38,305 --> 00:40:40,933
Oh, um, The 40s.

726
00:40:41,934 --> 00:40:44,058
That's where our
starter house was.

727
00:40:44,060 --> 00:40:45,727
Which street?

728
00:40:45,729 --> 00:40:46,977
Um, 44th.

729
00:40:46,979 --> 00:40:49,314
It's the three-story blue one

730
00:40:49,316 --> 00:40:52,024
with the white shutters and the
American flag in the front.

731
00:40:52,026 --> 00:40:53,151
Yeah. I know that one.

732
00:40:53,153 --> 00:40:55,030
Do you want to go over there
right now and eat?

733
00:40:55,488 --> 00:40:57,688
I live in Granite Bay, otherwise
I'd say let's go there.

734
00:40:58,033 --> 00:41:01,618
Actually, I was thinking maybe
we should go to the Deuce.

735
00:41:01,620 --> 00:41:04,245
I was talking to Kyle about it,
and he was like,

736
00:41:04,247 --> 00:41:07,082
"Whatever it's lame,
but maybe I'll see you there."

737
00:41:07,084 --> 00:41:08,582
How do you know Kyle?

738
00:41:08,584 --> 00:41:10,962
Oh, my mom made me get a job
at New Helvetia

739
00:41:10,964 --> 00:41:15,340
to learn, like,
"responsibility."

740
00:41:15,342 --> 00:41:17,427
Anyway, we hang out there.

741
00:41:17,429 --> 00:41:19,177
Yeah. Kyle's awesome.

742
00:41:19,179 --> 00:41:20,431
Let's Deuce it up.

743
00:41:22,308 --> 00:41:24,766
Okay, guys. Now, look.
Role one, right?

744
00:41:24,768 --> 00:41:26,893
You're gonna run, kind of,
a skinny post right up front.

745
00:41:26,895 --> 00:41:29,105
I want you to look straight
at the audience, okay.

746
00:41:29,107 --> 00:41:31,773
Don't be looking around and blabbing
at anybody if they walk by ya.

747
00:41:31,775 --> 00:41:34,318
Eight, nine, ten. You're coming
in hard, right here.

748
00:41:34,320 --> 00:41:35,720
'Cause these guys are
gonna love it.

749
00:41:37,197 --> 00:41:40,324
Don't talk amongst yourselves. Now,
coming in slow, we're singing.

750
00:41:40,326 --> 00:41:42,659
This is singing.
Wide lines are singing.

751
00:41:42,661 --> 00:41:44,619
We're singing. We're singing.

752
00:41:44,621 --> 00:41:46,788
Danny's not singing yet.
He's all alone.

753
00:41:46,790 --> 00:41:49,376
Singing. Eight, nine, ten...
You come in hot!

754
00:41:49,378 --> 00:41:51,127
You come in hot!

755
00:41:54,300 --> 00:41:56,883
- This is the Deuce?
- Yeah.

756
00:41:56,885 --> 00:42:00,511
- It's a parking lot?
- Yeah.

757
00:42:00,513 --> 00:42:03,890
We were in one parking lot and
we went to another parking lot?

758
00:42:03,892 --> 00:42:07,560
Hey, Kyle. Lady Bird and I just
decorated the Nun-mobile.

759
00:42:07,562 --> 00:42:09,479
Like, just married to Jesus.

760
00:42:09,481 --> 00:42:10,733
That's hella tight.

761
00:42:23,995 --> 00:42:26,288
What you do is very baller.

762
00:42:26,290 --> 00:42:27,873
- You're very anarchist.
- Yeah.

763
00:42:27,875 --> 00:42:29,125
Fuck 'em.

764
00:42:29,127 --> 00:42:30,710
Don't worry, I'm not gonna
snitch on you.

765
00:42:30,712 --> 00:42:33,297
Well, I hope not 'cause I'd
fuckin' kill your family.

766
00:42:36,342 --> 00:42:37,549
- What?
- Sorry.

767
00:42:37,551 --> 00:42:39,969
I... That-That was
an exaggeration.

768
00:42:39,971 --> 00:42:41,596
It's okay.

769
00:42:41,598 --> 00:42:43,473
My dad has cancer, so

770
00:42:43,475 --> 00:42:45,349
I guess God's doing that for us.

771
00:42:45,351 --> 00:42:46,978
Oh, I'm sorry.

772
00:42:49,605 --> 00:42:51,271
You work at New Helvetia, right?

773
00:42:51,273 --> 00:42:52,359
Right.

774
00:42:54,235 --> 00:42:55,985
Can I get your number? We were looking
to set up more gigs down there.

775
00:42:55,987 --> 00:42:57,030
Definitely.

776
00:43:00,074 --> 00:43:02,492
It's my parents number.

777
00:43:02,494 --> 00:43:04,620
You don't have a cell phone?

778
00:43:04,622 --> 00:43:05,870
- Nah.
- Good girl.

779
00:43:05,872 --> 00:43:07,747
Government didn't have to
put tracking devices on us.

780
00:43:07,749 --> 00:43:09,666
We bought them and put them on
ourselves.

781
00:43:09,668 --> 00:43:11,544
I don't own a tracking device.

782
00:43:11,546 --> 00:43:14,296
No, no, no. The cell phones.

783
00:43:14,298 --> 00:43:15,923
- You see?
- Wow.

784
00:43:15,925 --> 00:43:17,051
Yeah. I know.

785
00:43:18,718 --> 00:43:20,010
I mean, you'll have one eventually.
Everyone's gonna have one.

786
00:43:20,012 --> 00:43:23,055
And then,
it'll be a matter of time.

787
00:43:23,057 --> 00:43:24,432
Before what?

788
00:43:24,434 --> 00:43:26,142
Before they put them
in our brains.

789
00:44:02,638 --> 00:44:03,723
What do you want from me?

790
00:44:05,933 --> 00:44:07,060
Yes?

791
00:44:08,853 --> 00:44:11,206
My-My grandma wanted me to tell you
that she missed you at Christmas.

792
00:44:11,230 --> 00:44:14,607
Yeah. Well, I couldn't have gone anyway.
My mom was pissed about Thanksgiving.

793
00:44:14,609 --> 00:44:17,360
Your mom is crazy.
I'm scared of her.

794
00:44:17,362 --> 00:44:21,448
She's not crazy. She's just, you
know, she has a big heart.

795
00:44:21,450 --> 00:44:22,575
She's very warm.

796
00:44:22,577 --> 00:44:23,575
I don't find your mother warm.

797
00:44:23,577 --> 00:44:25,744
- You don't?
- No. No, she's warm. Yeah.

798
00:44:25,746 --> 00:44:28,622
- But she's also, kind of, scary.
- Well, you can't be scary and warm.

799
00:44:28,624 --> 00:44:31,251
- I think you can. Your mom is.
- You're gay.

800
00:44:32,628 --> 00:44:34,294
Fuck me.

801
00:44:34,296 --> 00:44:36,713
Can you not tell anyone, please?

802
00:44:36,715 --> 00:44:38,840
I'm so sorry about everything.

803
00:44:38,842 --> 00:44:42,803
I'm so ashamed of all of it.

804
00:44:42,805 --> 00:44:46,807
It's just... It's going to be bad and
I just need a little bit of time

805
00:44:46,809 --> 00:44:49,684
to figure out how I'm going to
tell my mom and dad and...

806
00:44:49,686 --> 00:44:54,899
Don't worry.

807
00:44:58,113 --> 00:44:59,155
I won't tell.

808
00:45:01,741 --> 00:45:02,743
It's okay.

809
00:45:12,585 --> 00:45:17,004
It's okay.

810
00:45:17,006 --> 00:45:19,300
And do you have a
support system?

811
00:45:20,386 --> 00:45:23,846
What do you mean?

812
00:45:23,848 --> 00:45:26,806
Who do you turn to when you feel
this way?

813
00:45:29,727 --> 00:45:31,104
No one, I guess.

814
00:45:33,150 --> 00:45:34,481
I'm sorry.

815
00:45:34,483 --> 00:45:35,733
No, don't be sorry.

816
00:45:35,735 --> 00:45:40,155
There's no wrong answer.

817
00:45:40,157 --> 00:45:42,030
Please don't tell your daughter.

818
00:45:42,032 --> 00:45:43,034
No. Of course not.

819
00:45:44,369 --> 00:45:45,370
Of course not.

820
00:45:49,166 --> 00:45:52,544
Remember that you are
dust and to dust you will return.

821
00:45:58,257 --> 00:46:05,929
Remember that you are
dust and to dust you will return.

822
00:46:05,931 --> 00:46:09,811
It's a new system. You just enter
your social security number and...

823
00:46:14,816 --> 00:46:16,274
- Davis?
- Davis is good.

824
00:46:16,276 --> 00:46:18,944
- Maybe you shoulda looked at it.
- It's only half an hour away.

825
00:46:18,946 --> 00:46:21,696
- Less if you're driving fast.
- I went to graduate school there.

826
00:46:21,698 --> 00:46:23,656
Lots of smart people
go to Davis.

827
00:46:23,658 --> 00:46:24,616
I thought Berkeley had to
accept me.

828
00:46:24,618 --> 00:46:26,743
You and Miguel went there.
I'm a legacy.

829
00:46:26,745 --> 00:46:28,620
Uh, not if we don't give money.

830
00:46:28,622 --> 00:46:30,663
- And you get bad grades.
- And what do you know about it?

831
00:46:30,665 --> 00:46:31,957
- Meaning?
- Nothing.

832
00:46:31,959 --> 00:46:33,750
- No. What are you implying?
- Nothing!

833
00:46:33,752 --> 00:46:35,585
You fucking racist!

834
00:46:35,587 --> 00:46:38,506
- I didn't say anything!
- I didn't put down my race!

835
00:46:38,508 --> 00:46:42,218
Oh, yeah. I'm sure they had no
idea, Miguel!

836
00:46:42,220 --> 00:46:43,761
You're actually fucking evil.

837
00:46:45,348 --> 00:46:47,389
- What is wrong with you?
- Go. Go to your room.

838
00:46:47,391 --> 00:46:49,601
- I'm not five!
- I didn't raise you like this.

839
00:46:49,603 --> 00:46:50,976
I don't have to go anywhere.

840
00:46:50,978 --> 00:46:53,021
I'm not going to a fucking
university

841
00:46:53,023 --> 00:46:56,193
that's famous for
its fucking agricultural school!

842
00:46:57,652 --> 00:47:00,903
And Miguel and Shelly, you'll never get
jobs with all that shit in your face.

843
00:47:05,828 --> 00:47:07,246
♪ Cry me a river ♪

844
00:47:08,746 --> 00:47:10,415
♪ Cry me a river ♪

845
00:47:11,833 --> 00:47:13,793

00:47:50,789 --> 00:47:52,205
What's wrong with cloves?

863
00:47:52,207 --> 00:47:53,874
Can't inhale cloves.
What's the point?

864
00:47:53,876 --> 00:47:55,167
Oh.

865
00:47:55,169 --> 00:47:56,836
You're not supposed to.

866
00:47:56,838 --> 00:48:00,089

- Yeah.

Sorry, sorry, sorry.

896
00:49:30,935 --> 00:49:33,101
It's just this is the only place
I can get any privacy.

897
00:49:33,103 --> 00:49:34,853
You really need to use two
towels?

898
00:49:34,855 --> 00:49:36,480
Uh, no.

899
00:49:36,482 --> 00:49:37,897
- I guess no.
- If you need to use two towels,

900
00:49:37,899 --> 00:49:40,109
you just have to say because
this affects my whole day.

901
00:49:40,111 --> 00:49:41,735
Because I have to do laundry
before work

902
00:49:41,737 --> 00:49:44,029
and I need to know if there's
more towels that I need to wash.

903
00:49:44,031 --> 00:49:45,364
I just need one. Sorry.

904
00:49:45,366 --> 00:49:48,828
Okay. Well, let me get to the
mirror, I've gotta get going.

905
00:49:56,878 --> 00:50:02,548
When do you think
is a normal time to have sex?

906
00:50:02,550 --> 00:50:04,550
- You're having sex?
- No.

907
00:50:04,552 --> 00:50:07,970
Um, college is good.

908
00:50:07,972 --> 00:50:12,517
I think college and use
protection like we talked about.

909
00:50:12,519 --> 00:50:13,519
Okay.

910
00:50:22,445 --> 00:50:24,072
Is Dad depressed?

911
00:50:25,072 --> 00:50:26,240
Why do you ask that?

912
00:50:27,534 --> 00:50:30,036
The pills. They have Dad's name
on them.

913
00:50:30,038 --> 00:50:33,625
Dad's been struggling
with depression for years.

914
00:50:38,046 --> 00:50:39,046
I didn't know that.

915
00:50:40,006 --> 00:50:42,216
Money is not life's report card.

916
00:50:43,426 --> 00:50:44,884
He's depressed about money?

917
00:50:44,886 --> 00:50:49,388
Being successful doesn't mean
anything in and of itself.

918
00:50:49,390 --> 00:50:50,931
It just means
that you're successful.

919
00:50:50,933 --> 00:50:52,850
Yeah,
but then you're successful.

920
00:50:52,852 --> 00:50:55,103
But that doesn't mean that
you're happy.

921
00:50:55,105 --> 00:50:56,523
But he's not happy.

922
00:51:09,244 --> 00:51:11,162
I have to get out of Sacramento.

923
00:51:12,748 --> 00:51:13,956
Why?

924
00:51:13,958 --> 00:51:17,084
Because it's soul killing.

925
00:51:17,086 --> 00:51:18,963
It's the Midwest of California.

926
00:51:20,965 --> 00:51:23,090
Isn't there a thing, like,

927
00:51:23,092 --> 00:51:24,885
"Think globally, act locally"?

928
00:51:26,594 --> 00:51:32,766
I feel that the person who said
that didn't live in Sacramento.

929
00:51:32,768 --> 00:51:34,059
Ah!

930
00:51:34,061 --> 00:51:35,394
I love it here.

931
00:51:35,396 --> 00:51:37,276
I want to send my daughters
to Immaculate Heart.

932
00:51:38,148 --> 00:51:39,941
I wanna... You know,
I wanna be a mom.

933
00:51:40,943 --> 00:51:42,528
At least go to San Francisco.

934
00:51:44,948 --> 00:51:49,408
I don't like hills.

935
00:51:49,410 --> 00:51:54,413
Start simple with x
plus three times x plus two.

936
00:51:54,415 --> 00:51:56,815
- Now if we use FOIL, where do we start?
- Julie?

937
00:51:58,419 --> 00:51:59,421
Julie?

938
00:52:01,298 --> 00:52:03,172
Julie. Hey.

939
00:52:03,174 --> 00:52:04,508
What do you want from Julie?

940
00:52:05,635 --> 00:52:06,926
Darlene, can you excuse us?

941
00:52:06,928 --> 00:52:08,261
Darlene's staying.

942
00:52:08,263 --> 00:52:09,678
Why aren't you in Algebra 2?

943
00:52:09,680 --> 00:52:11,055
- I switched sections.
- Why?

944
00:52:11,057 --> 00:52:12,890
Aren't Jenna and Kyle enough?

945
00:52:14,644 --> 00:52:16,018
I'm sorry that you're jealous.

946
00:52:16,020 --> 00:52:17,854
Jenna's a moron, you know.

947
00:52:17,856 --> 00:52:19,522
She's not. She's in AP Calculus.

948
00:52:19,524 --> 00:52:21,108
She's a moron in a deeper sense.

949
00:52:21,110 --> 00:52:22,110
You don't even know her.

950
00:52:23,987 --> 00:52:25,570
Miss Patty assigned you a role by the way,
you just never showed up to claim it!

951
00:52:25,572 --> 00:52:28,282
- What role?
- The tempest!

952
00:52:28,284 --> 00:52:32,161
- There is no role of the tempest!
- It is the titular role!

953
00:52:32,163 --> 00:52:35,246
No, it's a made up thing
so we all can participate!

954
00:52:35,248 --> 00:52:39,335
You can't do anything unless you're
the center of attention, can you?

955
00:52:39,337 --> 00:52:42,295
Yeah. Well, you know your mom's
tits, they're fake. Totally fake!

956
00:52:42,297 --> 00:52:44,673
She made one bad decision at 19!

957
00:52:44,675 --> 00:52:46,132
Two bad decisions!

958
00:52:46,134 --> 00:52:50,012
And at 15, this
girl was pregnant.

959
00:52:50,014 --> 00:52:52,681
She decided that she was going
to get an abortion.

960
00:52:52,683 --> 00:52:56,351
It made sense.
It was the right thing to do.

961
00:52:56,353 --> 00:52:59,231
- She was sitting there...
- Let me guess, she didn't get it.

962
00:52:59,233 --> 00:53:02,149
...and something deep inside of
her said,

963
00:53:02,151 --> 00:53:04,111
- "No."
- Bingo.

964
00:53:04,113 --> 00:53:06,988
Anyone want to guess who this
woman is?

965
00:53:06,990 --> 00:53:08,240
The young lady right here.

966
00:53:08,242 --> 00:53:10,908
- You?
- No. It was not me.

967
00:53:10,910 --> 00:53:12,785
Um, your friend?

968
00:53:12,787 --> 00:53:14,203
No.

969
00:53:14,205 --> 00:53:16,666
The girl in the story was...

970
00:53:17,917 --> 00:53:19,042
my mother.

971
00:53:21,129 --> 00:53:25,339
I am that baby that
she decided not to abort.

972
00:53:25,341 --> 00:53:27,133
That could have been me.

973
00:53:27,135 --> 00:53:28,843
That could have been my fate.

974
00:53:28,845 --> 00:53:32,013
Just because something looks ugly
doesn't mean it's morally wrong.

975
00:53:32,015 --> 00:53:33,335
What did you say, ma'am?

976
00:53:34,684 --> 00:53:36,895
- Nothing.
- Please. Share.

977
00:53:38,105 --> 00:53:40,148
I said,

978
00:53:40,150 --> 00:53:44,235
"Just because something looks ugly
doesn't mean that it's morally wrong."

979
00:53:44,237 --> 00:53:46,820
You think dead children
aren't morally wrong?

980
00:53:46,822 --> 00:53:52,409
No. I'm just saying that if you
took up close pictures of my vagina

981
00:53:52,411 --> 00:53:56,204
while I was on my period, it would be
disturbing, but it doesn't make it wrong.

982
00:53:56,206 --> 00:53:57,289
Excuse me?

983
00:53:57,291 --> 00:53:59,791
Listen. If your mother had
had the abortion,

984
00:53:59,793 --> 00:54:02,378
we wouldn't have to sit through
this stupid assembly.

985
00:54:08,011 --> 00:54:10,386
Suspended? How does
this happen?

986
00:54:10,388 --> 00:54:13,182
Everything we do is for you.
Everything.

987
00:54:13,184 --> 00:54:15,184
Do you think
I like driving that car around?

988
00:54:15,186 --> 00:54:16,225
- No.
- Do you?

989
00:54:16,227 --> 00:54:18,227
- No.
- Do you think I like working double shifts

990
00:54:18,229 --> 00:54:19,187
at the psych hospital?

991
00:54:19,189 --> 00:54:21,439
- No.
- You needed to go to the Catholic school

992
00:54:21,441 --> 00:54:24,859
because your brother saw somebody knifed
in front of him at the public school.

993
00:54:24,861 --> 00:54:27,278
Is that what you want? Larry, what
are you doing on the computer?

994
00:54:27,280 --> 00:54:29,155
- Nothing.
- You think your dad and I don't know

995
00:54:29,157 --> 00:54:32,033
how ashamed that you are of us?
Your dad knows.

996
00:54:32,035 --> 00:54:35,287
Your dad knows why you ask him to drop you
off a block away from school every day.

997
00:54:35,289 --> 00:54:38,122
- Dad, I didn't mean to.
- You made him feel horrible!

998
00:54:38,124 --> 00:54:40,124
- Horrible! You know that?
- I'm sorry.

999
00:54:41,253 --> 00:54:42,169
- Marion, you didn't have to bring that up.
- No, Larry, you can't just be

1000
00:54:42,171 --> 00:54:43,377
the nice guy. She has to know.

1001
00:54:43,379 --> 00:54:45,004
She has to know how you feel.

1002
00:54:45,006 --> 00:54:47,508
Otherwise, she's just gonna think
she can say anything at all,

1003
00:54:47,510 --> 00:54:50,136
and nobody ever gets hurt.

1004
00:54:50,138 --> 00:54:51,929
Wrong side of the tracks!

1005
00:54:51,931 --> 00:54:53,598
- I didn't mean it that way.
- Yeah.

1006
00:54:53,600 --> 00:54:55,224
- It was a joke.
- Yeah. It's just a joke Mom and Dad.

1007
00:54:55,226 --> 00:54:58,353
They don't care. We didn't think
we'd be in this house for 25 years.

1008
00:54:58,355 --> 00:55:00,020
We thought we would've moved
some place better.

1009
00:55:00,022 --> 00:55:01,855
Whatever we give you,
it's never enough.

1010
00:55:01,857 --> 00:55:03,607
- It's never enough.
- It is enough.

1011
00:55:03,609 --> 00:55:05,944
Do you have any idea
what it costs to raise you?

1012
00:55:05,946 --> 00:55:09,322
And how much you're just
throwing away every day?

1013
00:55:09,324 --> 00:55:12,407
Give me a number.

1014
00:55:12,409 --> 00:55:13,411
What?

1015
00:55:20,167 --> 00:55:21,335
Give me a number.

1016
00:55:22,795 --> 00:55:23,839
I don't understand.

1017
00:55:25,297 --> 00:55:27,047
You give me a number for how
much it cost to raise me.

1018
00:55:27,049 --> 00:55:29,510
And I'm going to get older
and make a lot of money,

1019
00:55:29,512 --> 00:55:31,303
and write you a check for what I
owe you.

1020
00:55:31,305 --> 00:55:33,641
So that I never have
to speak to you again.

1021
00:55:34,851 --> 00:55:38,311
Well I highly doubt that you will be able
to get a job good enough to do that.

1022
00:55:44,443 --> 00:55:46,360
So the attack on
Baghdad last night,

1023
00:55:46,362 --> 00:55:48,320
it was absolutely unbelievable.

1024
00:55:48,322 --> 00:55:50,948
That's right. Yeah,
the likes of which, uh, many US...

1025
00:55:50,950 --> 00:55:53,450
- Hello?
- Hey, it's me, Jenna.

1026
00:55:53,452 --> 00:55:55,952
Hey. Are you calling
me from school?

1027
00:55:55,954 --> 00:55:59,372
No. We got out early 'cause all the Irish
girls got totally sloshed by noon.

1028
00:55:59,374 --> 00:56:01,791
Oh, right.
Happy St. Patrick's Day.

1029
00:56:01,793 --> 00:56:04,545
Yeah. I guess they'd been
stockpiling mini liquor bottles

1030
00:56:04,547 --> 00:56:05,880
in the tampon machine,

1031
00:56:05,882 --> 00:56:07,174
and now they're all throwing up.

1032
00:56:07,176 --> 00:56:08,969
Everyone else got out early.

1033
00:56:09,969 --> 00:56:11,719
So, guess where I am.

1034
00:56:11,721 --> 00:56:13,013
I don't know. Where?

1035
00:56:13,015 --> 00:56:15,931
Ding dong. I'm outside.

1036
00:56:15,933 --> 00:56:18,227
- What?
- I'm standing outside.

1037
00:56:19,897 --> 00:56:22,272
No. Just leave.

1038
00:56:22,274 --> 00:56:23,274
Leave.

1039
00:56:24,234 --> 00:56:26,609
- Fuck!
- Hello.

1040
00:56:26,611 --> 00:56:27,695
Hi.

1041
00:56:35,286 --> 00:56:36,455
So this is your house?

1042
00:56:38,415 --> 00:56:39,790
Yeah.

1043
00:56:39,792 --> 00:56:42,918
That lady in the other house
was totally freaked out.

1044
00:56:42,920 --> 00:56:46,006
That's my friend's grandma.
That's her house.

1045
00:56:48,300 --> 00:56:53,262
Why did you say
it was your house?

1046
00:56:53,264 --> 00:56:55,474
I wished I lived in that house.

1047
00:56:56,601 --> 00:57:00,436
I don't even sort of understand why
somebody would lie about that.

1048
00:57:00,438 --> 00:57:02,063
I-I didn't lie.

1049
00:57:02,065 --> 00:57:04,064
You lied. You're a liar.

1050
00:57:04,066 --> 00:57:05,983
I hate dishonesty.

1051
00:57:05,985 --> 00:57:06,985
I'm sorry.

1052
00:57:11,657 --> 00:57:13,325
Apology accepted, I guess.

1053
00:57:16,161 --> 00:57:17,830
Are we still friends?

1054
00:57:18,831 --> 00:57:22,502
I mean, if you're still Kyle's girlfriend,
then yeah, I guess I'll see you around.

1055
00:57:28,968 --> 00:57:32,386
Mortar rounds fired at
the camp that will fly over them

1056
00:57:32,388 --> 00:57:35,430
if they are down below
on surface of the ground.

1057
00:57:35,432 --> 00:57:38,894
And that is hard work, indeed. Believe me.
We've had to do it...

1058
00:57:41,772 --> 00:57:42,982
I'm ready.

1059
00:57:44,357 --> 00:57:45,774
What?

1060
00:57:45,776 --> 00:57:48,569
I'm ready to have sex.

1061
00:57:48,571 --> 00:57:50,573
Oh. Okay.

1062
00:57:51,698 --> 00:57:52,700
Great.

1063
00:58:01,333 --> 00:58:03,376
You're so dexterous with that.

1064
00:58:03,378 --> 00:58:04,378
Thanks.

1065
00:58:08,090 --> 00:58:09,550
Oh.

1066
00:58:17,726 --> 00:58:21,811
- You okay?
- Yeah.

1067
00:58:42,502 --> 00:58:43,503
Are you...

1068
00:58:44,461 --> 00:58:46,963
- Are you done?
- Yeah. Yes.

1069
00:58:48,381 --> 00:58:51,466
Sorry. I was confused.

1070
00:58:51,468 --> 00:58:53,468
- You have like...
- What?

1071
00:58:53,470 --> 00:58:55,971
- You have some sort of like blood.
- What?

1072
00:58:55,973 --> 00:58:57,640
Oh. Shit!

1073
00:58:57,642 --> 00:58:59,185
I get nosebleeds.

1074
00:59:00,727 --> 00:59:02,352
- Here.
- Thanks.

1075
00:59:02,354 --> 00:59:04,479
I'm sorry.

1076
00:59:04,481 --> 00:59:05,481
No. I'm good.

1077
00:59:06,399 --> 00:59:09,567
Remember when
tie-dye was an activity?

1078
00:59:09,569 --> 00:59:12,947
Oh, I didn't make that shirt. My
parents got it for me at Sea Ranch.

1079
00:59:12,949 --> 00:59:15,326
You can read Sea Ranch if you
look close.

1080
00:59:18,579 --> 00:59:20,540
Cut to ten years later.

1081
00:59:22,250 --> 00:59:23,875
What?

1082
00:59:23,877 --> 00:59:26,628
Like how ten years ago,
you were in first grade.

1083
00:59:26,630 --> 00:59:28,215
Now we cut to...

1084
00:59:29,549 --> 00:59:32,550
What does cut to mean to you?

1085
00:59:32,552 --> 00:59:35,554
Or like, you know,
little did he know.

1086
00:59:35,556 --> 00:59:37,097
Nothing you're saying is making
any sense.

1087
00:59:37,099 --> 00:59:38,931
How we're not virgins now.

1088
00:59:38,933 --> 00:59:42,186
We deflowered each other.
We have each other's flowers.

1089
00:59:49,028 --> 00:59:50,113
Sorry.

1090
00:59:51,990 --> 00:59:53,198
I'm just happy.

1091
00:59:58,079 --> 01:00:00,247
I didn't lose my
virginity to you.

1092
01:00:02,709 --> 01:00:03,710
Wait...

1093
01:00:04,711 --> 01:00:05,712
What?

1094
01:00:06,713 --> 01:00:09,131
I lost my virginity to
Cassy Duvall.

1095
01:00:10,466 --> 01:00:11,591
Excuse me?

1096
01:00:11,593 --> 01:00:13,133
You said you were a virgin.

1097
01:00:13,135 --> 01:00:15,260
No, I didn't. 'Cause I'm not.

1098
01:00:15,262 --> 01:00:19,640
- And I haven't lied in two years.
- Oh, Jesus.

1099
01:00:19,642 --> 01:00:22,395
Yeah. I probably slept with,
like, six people.

1100
01:00:25,315 --> 01:00:27,732
You don't even know if
it's six people?

1101
01:00:27,734 --> 01:00:29,525
I don't keep a list.

1102
01:00:29,527 --> 01:00:30,944
Why wouldn't you keep a list?

1103
01:00:30,946 --> 01:00:33,029
- We're in high school.
- Whoa. Why are you... What?

1104
01:00:33,031 --> 01:00:36,326
- Why are you getting so moody?
- You did say you were a virgin.

1105
01:00:37,328 --> 01:00:39,163
I think you might've
made an assumption.

1106
01:00:41,123 --> 01:00:43,540
I just had a whole experience
that was wrong.

1107
01:00:43,542 --> 01:00:46,210
- Look, you're deciding to be upset.
- No. I am upset.

1108
01:00:46,212 --> 01:00:48,420
Because you're deciding to be.
Don't be mad at me for this.

1109
01:00:48,422 --> 01:00:51,089
It's stupid. You can't be mad at me
for something I have no control over.

1110
01:00:51,091 --> 01:00:53,090
I just wanted it to be special.

1111
01:00:53,092 --> 01:00:56,386
Why? You're gonna have so much
unspecial sex in your life.

1112
01:00:56,388 --> 01:00:59,848
I was on top! Who the fuck is on
top their first time?

1113
01:00:59,850 --> 01:01:02,769
You have any, like, awareness of
how many civilians we've killed

1114
01:01:02,771 --> 01:01:05,396
- since the invasion in Iraq started...
- Shut up!

1115
01:01:05,398 --> 01:01:07,564
Shut up.

1116
01:01:07,566 --> 01:01:10,152
Different things can be sad.
It's not all war.

1117
01:01:20,079 --> 01:01:22,123
Are we still going to
prom together?

1118
01:01:23,541 --> 01:01:24,543
Sure.

1119
01:01:48,192 --> 01:01:50,692
I thought Miguel was gonna pick
me up.

1120
01:01:50,694 --> 01:01:55,447
Well, I was just arriving from
work and it was easier.

1121
01:01:55,449 --> 01:01:59,326
You okay?

1122
01:01:59,328 --> 01:02:01,036
Aww, honey.

1123
01:02:01,038 --> 01:02:02,206
He...

1124
01:02:03,207 --> 01:02:06,500
Oh. Oh, it's okay.

1125
01:02:06,502 --> 01:02:07,962
It's okay.

1126
01:02:10,964 --> 01:02:12,549
What's this sweater?

1127
01:02:13,759 --> 01:02:17,262
This is... My friend,
Jenna, gave it to me.

1128
01:02:17,264 --> 01:02:18,762
Who's Jenna?

1129
01:02:18,764 --> 01:02:19,764
My friend.

1130
01:02:24,271 --> 01:02:26,938
You wanna do our
favorite Sunday activity?

1131
01:02:26,940 --> 01:02:31,193
I don't have a second shift.

1132
01:02:31,195 --> 01:02:32,196
Yeah.

1133
01:03:11,319 --> 01:03:13,027
The attack came in waves,

1134
01:03:13,029 --> 01:03:16,739
cruise missiles, followed by
the F117 stealth bombers

1135
01:03:16,741 --> 01:03:19,951
with so-called
bunker buster bombs.

1136
01:03:19,953 --> 01:03:21,993
With target a bunker believed...

1137
01:03:21,995 --> 01:03:24,830
Lady Bird, a bunch of things
arrived for you.

1138
01:03:24,832 --> 01:03:25,832
Holy shit!

1139
01:03:27,709 --> 01:03:29,586
- Since when do you get mail?
- I get mail.

1140
01:03:32,007 --> 01:03:35,052
Whatever you're up to,
it's not gonna end well.

1141
01:04:00,702 --> 01:04:01,704
Yes!

1142
01:04:06,666 --> 01:04:08,917
These programmers nowadays
are like kids, man.

1143
01:04:08,919 --> 01:04:10,210
I know.

1144
01:04:10,212 --> 01:04:13,881
But that's why I think with me,
you'll find something different.

1145
01:04:13,883 --> 01:04:15,758
Yeah, but they're like babies.

1146
01:04:15,760 --> 01:04:17,718
I hear you. It's wild.

1147
01:04:17,720 --> 01:04:19,721
Which is why I went back to
school

1148
01:04:19,723 --> 01:04:23,308
and got my MBA at UC Davis
while still working at ISC.

1149
01:04:23,310 --> 01:04:24,975
Oh.

1150
01:04:24,977 --> 01:04:26,895
- Wow. That must've been a lot of work.
- It was.

1151
01:04:26,897 --> 01:04:28,855
I heard ISC's closing now
though.

1152
01:04:28,857 --> 01:04:30,607
I heard. Yes.

1153
01:04:30,609 --> 01:04:34,571
So the assholes who fired you
are now closing up shop.

1154
01:04:35,946 --> 01:04:38,407
- Feels good.
- Yeah.

1155
01:04:40,910 --> 01:04:41,912
Uh...

1156
01:04:43,287 --> 01:04:45,747
What else is supposed to happen?

1157
01:04:45,749 --> 01:04:47,752
Oh, I, uh, thought we'd...

1158
01:04:48,920 --> 01:04:50,546
talk about the position.

1159
01:04:52,632 --> 01:04:53,633
How'd it go?

1160
01:04:56,134 --> 01:04:59,804
Let's go buy a big bag of
Doritos and eat them in the car

1161
01:04:59,806 --> 01:05:01,808
- to celebrate your wait list.
- Okay.

1162
01:05:02,808 --> 01:05:05,936
But don't tell Mom about the
Doritos or the wait list.

1163
01:05:07,521 --> 01:05:08,896
- Hey.
- Hi, son.

1164
01:05:08,898 --> 01:05:10,898
Wait. What are you doing here?

1165
01:05:10,900 --> 01:05:12,942
Well, um...

1166
01:05:12,944 --> 01:05:15,237
I guess we're, uh,
going for the same job then.

1167
01:05:18,907 --> 01:05:20,576
Looks like it.

1168
01:05:23,997 --> 01:05:25,832
- Go get 'em.
- Thanks.

1169
01:05:27,376 --> 01:05:28,794
- This-This way? Okay.
- Yeah, yeah.

1170
01:05:34,591 --> 01:05:37,676
I know it was you
who did the just married thing.

1171
01:05:37,678 --> 01:05:39,261
It wasn't me.

1172
01:05:39,263 --> 01:05:41,095
I'm not going to punish you.

1173
01:05:41,097 --> 01:05:42,763
Oh. Why not?

1174
01:05:44,059 --> 01:05:45,144
It was funny.

1175
01:05:47,146 --> 01:05:50,147
Sister Gina and I drove all the way home
before we noticed people were honking.

1176
01:05:50,149 --> 01:05:52,607
Really?

1177
01:05:52,609 --> 01:05:57,946
To be fair, I wasn't just married to Jesus.
It's been 40 years.

1178
01:05:57,948 --> 01:05:59,363
Well, he's a lucky guy.

1179
01:06:00,993 --> 01:06:02,578
I read your college essay.

1180
01:06:04,663 --> 01:06:07,998
You clearly love Sacramento.

1181
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:10,710
- I do?
- You write about Sacramento

1182
01:06:10,712 --> 01:06:13,420
so affectionately and with such
care.

1183
01:06:13,422 --> 01:06:15,630
Well, I was just describing it.

1184
01:06:15,632 --> 01:06:18,175
Well, it comes across as love.

1185
01:06:18,177 --> 01:06:22,804
Sure. I guess I pay attention.

1186
01:06:22,806 --> 01:06:25,808
Don't you think
they are maybe the same thing?

1187
01:06:25,810 --> 01:06:28,395
Love and attention?

1188
01:06:36,279 --> 01:06:39,573
Guess you won't be
going to any dances in college.

1189
01:06:39,575 --> 01:06:41,200
This is our last one.

1190
01:06:41,202 --> 01:06:44,035
You know Davis has a terrific
theater

1191
01:06:44,037 --> 01:06:45,995
if you're still interested in
theater.

1192
01:06:45,997 --> 01:06:49,874
- Are ya?
- I'm probably no good at acting.

1193
01:06:49,876 --> 01:06:53,754
Why don't I look like
the girls in the magazines?

1194
01:06:53,756 --> 01:06:56,589
It's too bad I can't meet
this Kyle before prom.

1195
01:06:56,591 --> 01:06:58,925
Well, he's not my boyfriend
anymore.

1196
01:06:58,927 --> 01:07:00,803
I mean, maybe he never even was.

1197
01:07:00,805 --> 01:07:02,097
Well, I'd still like to meet
him.

1198
01:07:03,474 --> 01:07:05,559
It's too tight. Fuck.

1199
01:07:07,102 --> 01:07:10,144
Well, I suggested you not have
that second helping of pasta.

1200
01:07:10,146 --> 01:07:13,064
- Mom.
- Honey, you seem upset about it

1201
01:07:13,066 --> 01:07:15,985
- and I'm trying to help.
- You're giving me an eating disorder.

1202
01:07:15,987 --> 01:07:18,698
I wish
I could get an eating disorder.

1203
01:07:27,332 --> 01:07:28,792
I love it.

1204
01:07:30,085 --> 01:07:31,294
Is it too pink?

1205
01:07:35,297 --> 01:07:36,299
What?

1206
01:07:41,138 --> 01:07:42,931
Why can't you say I look nice?

1207
01:07:44,473 --> 01:07:46,014
I thought you didn't even care
what I think.

1208
01:07:46,016 --> 01:07:49,143
- I still want you to think I look good.
- Okay. I'm sorry.

1209
01:07:49,145 --> 01:07:51,728
I was telling you the truth.
You want me to lie?

1210
01:07:51,730 --> 01:07:53,860
No. I mean, I just wish...

1211
01:07:55,110 --> 01:07:56,110
I just...

1212
01:07:57,613 --> 01:07:59,073
I wish that you liked me.

1213
01:08:00,575 --> 01:08:02,160
Of course I love you.

1214
01:08:05,412 --> 01:08:06,914
But do you like me?

1215
01:08:11,001 --> 01:08:16,298
I want you to be the very best
version of yourself that you can be.

1216
01:08:17,757 --> 01:08:19,843
What if this is the best
version?

1217
01:08:34,234 --> 01:08:35,649
You look really pretty.

1218
01:08:35,651 --> 01:08:37,109
- Really?
- Yeah.

1219
01:08:37,111 --> 01:08:38,739
You look like a badass girl
in a band.

1220
01:08:39,823 --> 01:08:42,157
Thanks.

1221
01:08:43,368 --> 01:08:45,117
Um...

1222
01:08:45,119 --> 01:08:47,120
I guess that's my date.

1223
01:08:47,122 --> 01:08:51,207
You aren't gonna get in a car
with a guy who honks, are ya?

1224
01:08:51,209 --> 01:08:52,919
I think, yes, I am.

1225
01:08:54,838 --> 01:08:56,462
Let me get your picture.

1226
01:08:56,464 --> 01:08:58,255
Your mom's pissed,
she had to work a double.

1227
01:08:58,257 --> 01:08:59,926
Even you deserve
better than this.

1228
01:09:02,303 --> 01:09:04,179
Have a good time.

1229
01:09:04,181 --> 01:09:05,346
Yeah. Good luck.

1230
01:09:05,348 --> 01:09:07,392
- See ya.
- See ya.

1231
01:09:09,019 --> 01:09:11,938
- I think she's weird.
- She is weird.

1232
01:09:11,940 --> 01:09:13,230
Hey, guys.

1233
01:09:13,232 --> 01:09:15,233
I guess I'll just sit shotgun.

1234
01:09:15,235 --> 01:09:16,235
Yeah.

1235
01:09:18,987 --> 01:09:21,404
- You look really nice, Kyle.
- You look good.

1236
01:09:21,406 --> 01:09:22,574
Thanks.

1237
01:09:23,575 --> 01:09:24,699
Hi.

1238
01:09:24,701 --> 01:09:26,079
- Hi.
- Hey.

1239
01:09:31,584 --> 01:09:32,707
Hey, what's going on, man?

1240
01:09:35,045 --> 01:09:36,505
Hey. Yeah. Okay,
that sounds great.

1241
01:09:37,714 --> 01:09:39,297
Okay.

1242
01:09:39,299 --> 01:09:42,176
Hey, do you guys wanna ditch prom
and just go to Mike's instead?

1243
01:09:42,178 --> 01:09:44,012
Yeah. I hate dances.

1244
01:09:44,014 --> 01:09:45,097
Yes.

1245
01:09:45,099 --> 01:09:48,225

There's someone here to see you.

1263

- Hey.
- Hey.

1264
01:11:00,217 --> 01:11:02,259
- Are you okay?
- Fine. I'm fine.

1265
01:11:02,261 --> 01:11:04,260
What happened?

1266
01:11:04,262 --> 01:11:05,765
Nothing really. Nothing.

1267
01:11:06,973 --> 01:11:09,265
Why are you crying?

1268
01:11:09,267 --> 01:11:11,018
Just crying.

1269
01:11:11,020 --> 01:11:19,020
Some people aren't built happy,
you know.

1270
01:11:23,156 --> 01:11:24,490
Oh, my gosh.

1271
01:11:24,492 --> 01:11:25,950
We ate all the cheese.

1272
01:11:25,952 --> 01:11:29,620
It's okay. Lots of cheese vary
in size.

1273
01:11:29,622 --> 01:11:31,956
- This one was a small one.
- It's so small.

1274
01:11:31,958 --> 01:11:33,249
- It was tiny.
- That's not our fault.

1275
01:11:33,251 --> 01:11:34,875
What-What were we to do?

1276
01:11:34,877 --> 01:11:37,128
Fuck it! Let's just go to prom.

1277
01:11:37,130 --> 01:11:38,712
Doesn't your mom have a dress?

1278
01:11:38,714 --> 01:11:40,881
Let's be honest.
I've had a dress for months.

1279
01:11:42,261 --> 01:11:43,217
It's purple.

1280
01:11:43,219 --> 01:11:45,220
- It is?
- Uh-hmm, you're really gonna like it.

1281
01:11:45,222 --> 01:11:46,930
- Come and see it.
- Okay.

1282
01:11:46,932 --> 01:11:49,099
Cracker time. Dress time.

1283
01:11:49,101 --> 01:11:50,183

You can totally
be quiet during it.

1294
01:12:33,103 --> 01:12:34,686
Was it amazing though?

1295
01:12:34,688 --> 01:12:36,521
I wanted it so badly,

1296
01:12:36,523 --> 01:12:41,028
but then I found that
when it happened...

1297
01:12:42,112 --> 01:12:44,905
I-I really like dry humping
much more.

1298
01:12:47,744 --> 01:12:50,370
You're not a virgin.

1299
01:12:50,372 --> 01:12:52,748
- I can't wait for state fair.
- Ah, I know.

1300
01:12:52,750 --> 01:12:54,585
Log ride.

1301
01:12:58,421 --> 01:13:00,049
- Shit.
- What?

1302
01:13:01,466 --> 01:13:04,718
I'm not gonna be here this summer,
like, all summer, basically.

1303
01:13:04,720 --> 01:13:06,719
- Why not?
- My dad, my real dad,

1304
01:13:06,721 --> 01:13:08,389
he resurfaced in Yellowstone,

1305
01:13:08,808 --> 01:13:11,060
and he wants me to come there
for the summer,

1306
01:13:11,644 --> 01:13:13,103
before I start SCC.

1307
01:13:13,854 --> 01:13:14,897
Oh.

1308
01:13:16,940 --> 01:13:19,607
I'm not going anywhere to college,
so it seemed like a good opportunity.

1309
01:13:19,609 --> 01:13:20,652
Yeah.

1310
01:13:22,863 --> 01:13:25,199
I'm gonna miss
the fuck out of you.

1311
01:13:27,409 --> 01:13:29,661
I probably won't get in, so

1312
01:13:29,663 --> 01:13:32,082
I'll go to Davis
and I'll see you every day.

1313
01:13:39,172 --> 01:13:43,633
Now, I want spirits to enforce,
and art to enchant,

1314
01:13:43,635 --> 01:13:45,220
and my ending is despair.

1315
01:13:46,512 --> 01:13:48,012
Unless I be relieved by prayer,

1316
01:13:48,014 --> 01:13:52,015
which pierces so that
it assaults mercy itself

1317
01:13:52,017 --> 01:13:54,434
and freeze all faults.

1318
01:13:54,436 --> 01:13:57,522
As you from crimes would
pardon thee.

1319
01:13:57,524 --> 01:14:00,441
Let your indulgence set me free.

1320
01:14:00,443 --> 01:14:02,317
Yes!

1321
01:14:02,319 --> 01:14:03,862
Ooh!

1322
01:14:06,033 --> 01:14:09,704
Christine "Lady Bird" McPherson.

1323
01:14:12,707 --> 01:14:14,331
Yeah!

1324
01:14:14,333 --> 01:14:16,000
Cheers.

1325
01:14:16,002 --> 01:14:17,667
To Miguel and his new job.

1326
01:14:17,669 --> 01:14:19,461
- Yay.
- Here, here. Yes.

1327
01:14:19,463 --> 01:14:22,631
- To Lady Bird going to Davis.
- To Davis.

1328
01:14:22,633 --> 01:14:24,425
- Congratulations.
- Good school.

1329
01:14:24,427 --> 01:14:28,470
Hey. So I talked to my manager and, um,
you could totally take over my old job.

1330
01:14:28,472 --> 01:14:31,264
- Great. Thanks, Miguel.
- I'm so proud of you, Lady Bird.

1331
01:14:31,266 --> 01:14:33,391
You walked weird across the
stage, but you did it!

1332
01:14:33,393 --> 01:14:35,478
- I didn't walk weird.
- Well, it seemed a little weird.

1333
01:14:35,480 --> 01:14:38,730
- Hey, hey, hey!
- Hey.

1334
01:14:38,732 --> 01:14:40,690
Aw, I missed you guys.

1335
01:14:40,692 --> 01:14:42,485
Oh, did you find out about the
wait list?

1336
01:14:42,487 --> 01:14:43,946
Oh, fuck.

1337
01:14:47,617 --> 01:14:49,283
What?

1338
01:14:49,285 --> 01:14:55,164
I'm not even in yet, so this
might not even be a problem.

1339
01:14:55,166 --> 01:14:57,501
I'm sorry. I shouldn't have gone
behind your back.

1340
01:14:57,503 --> 01:15:01,173
I just... It's not like I'm
definitely going to New York.

1341
01:15:02,590 --> 01:15:03,590
Mom.

1342
01:15:05,052 --> 01:15:06,135
Mom.

1343
01:15:07,638 --> 01:15:09,512
Aren't you, sort of, proud
that I'm so close to getting in?

1344
01:15:09,514 --> 01:15:11,389
Just a little?

1345
01:15:11,391 --> 01:15:13,725
I mean... yes, I know it was
probably easier

1346
01:15:13,727 --> 01:15:17,395
because 9-11 and less people applying
with terrorism and all that,

1347
01:15:17,397 --> 01:15:19,649
but still though, I'm sorry.

1348
01:15:19,651 --> 01:15:23,860
I know I can lie
and not be a good person, but...

1349
01:15:23,862 --> 01:15:25,488
please, Mom.

1350
01:15:25,490 --> 01:15:27,448
Please. I'm so sorry.

1351
01:15:27,450 --> 01:15:29,325
I didn't mean to hurt you.

1352
01:15:29,327 --> 01:15:31,535
I-I appreciate everything
you've done for me.

1353
01:15:31,537 --> 01:15:33,538
I'm ungrateful and I'm so sorry.

1354
01:15:33,540 --> 01:15:35,166
I'm so sorry I wanted more.

1355
01:15:37,501 --> 01:15:39,793
Just... Please!

1356
01:15:39,795 --> 01:15:40,796
Talk to me.

1357
01:15:41,880 --> 01:15:43,673
I know I'm-I'm so bad!

1358
01:15:43,675 --> 01:15:44,882
I know I am.

1359
01:15:44,884 --> 01:15:46,801
But please just talk to me, Mom.

1360
01:15:46,803 --> 01:15:48,388
Mom, please talk to me.

1361
01:16:02,528 --> 01:16:04,236
Here.

1362
01:16:04,238 --> 01:16:05,322
Then next one.

1363
01:16:07,699 --> 01:16:09,033
That'll be three dollars.

1364
01:16:12,662 --> 01:16:14,036
You passed.

1365
01:16:14,038 --> 01:16:15,580
- Seriously?
- Yes.

1366
01:16:15,582 --> 01:16:17,833
Thanks.

1367
01:16:17,835 --> 01:16:19,375
It's not a thanking situation.

1368
01:16:19,377 --> 01:16:21,087
You either pass or
you don't pass.

1369
01:16:22,088 --> 01:16:23,797
Yay.

1370
01:16:27,094 --> 01:16:28,095
Come in.

1371
01:16:31,890 --> 01:16:33,476
Happy birthday to you

1372
01:16:35,645 --> 01:16:37,144
You remembered.

1373
01:16:37,146 --> 01:16:38,314
You're my only daughter.

1374
01:16:40,025 --> 01:16:42,027
Well, Shelly too. Kind of.

1375
01:16:43,528 --> 01:16:44,905
Thanks.

1376
01:16:47,239 --> 01:16:48,240
Make a wish.

1377
01:16:54,580 --> 01:16:56,706
Are you and Mom gonna
get a divorce over this?

1378
01:16:56,708 --> 01:16:58,832
No. We can't afford to.

1379
01:16:58,834 --> 01:17:00,962
Dad.

1380
01:17:01,296 --> 01:17:02,379
I'm kidding, no.

1381
01:17:02,756 --> 01:17:04,630
I love your mom.

1382
01:17:04,632 --> 01:17:06,049
Does Mom hate me?

1383
01:17:06,051 --> 01:17:09,678
You both have such
strong personalities.

1384
01:17:10,972 --> 01:17:14,099
She doesn't know how to help you
and it frustrates her.

1385
01:17:14,101 --> 01:17:15,810
I wish she'd talk to me.

1386
01:17:15,812 --> 01:17:21,314
She will. I know.

1387
01:17:21,316 --> 01:17:22,817
Happy 18.

1388
01:17:22,819 --> 01:17:23,819
Thanks.

1389
01:17:25,196 --> 01:17:26,197
Do you want some?

1390
01:17:27,280 --> 01:17:29,657
Yes.

1391
01:17:29,659 --> 01:17:32,076
One pack of Camel Lights please,

1392
01:17:32,078 --> 01:17:33,702

1393
01:17:33,704 --> 01:17:36,204

1395
01:17:38,668 --> 01:17:40,667
That'll be 10.87.

1396
01:17:40,669 --> 01:17:43,671
Oh, um, it's my birthday today.

1397
01:17:43,673 --> 01:17:47,132
I'm 18, which is why all these
things, I can buy them.

1398
01:17:47,134 --> 01:17:48,678
Okay. Happy birthday.

1399
01:17:56,562 --> 01:18:04,562

You can't walk up

She was worried that there would
be errors or mistakes or something,

01:22:32,136 --> 01:22:34,972
that you'd judge
her writing abilities.

I wouldn't do that.

I salvaged them, okay?

01:27:25,145 --> 01:27:31,691
Did you feel emotional the first
time that you drove in Sacramento?

1472
01:27:31,693 --> 01:27:35,486
I did, and I wanted to tell you,

1473
01:27:35,488 --> 01:27:38,407

when it happened.

01:28:07,355 --> 01:28:08,940
