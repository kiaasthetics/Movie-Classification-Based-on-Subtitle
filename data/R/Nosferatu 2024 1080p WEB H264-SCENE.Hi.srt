01:05:31,710 --> 01:05:34,755
Dr. Sievers tells me that
you have had these spells

939
01:05:34,756 --> 01:05:37,236
since childhood.

940
01:05:37,237 --> 01:05:39,978
Would you describe
them to me, please?

941
01:05:39,979 --> 01:05:42,676
I cannot always remember them.

942
01:05:42,677 --> 01:05:46,028
As if my spirit wanders off.

943
01:05:46,029 --> 01:05:48,248
Tell me what you can,
from the beginning.

944
01:05:50,337 --> 01:05:54,166
Sometimes it was...
it is like a dream.

945
01:05:54,167 --> 01:05:55,994
- Hmm.
- And I know things.

946
01:05:55,995 --> 01:05:59,258
I always knew the contents
of my Christmas gifts.

947
01:05:59,259 --> 01:06:02,566
I knew when that my
mother would pass.

948
01:06:02,567 --> 01:06:06,396
Father, he would find me in
our fields within the forest

949
01:06:06,397 --> 01:06:10,008
as if I was his little
changeling girl.

950
01:06:10,009 --> 01:06:11,314
I see.

951
01:06:11,315 --> 01:06:13,229
But as I became
older, it worsened.

952
01:06:13,230 --> 01:06:15,187
I frightened him.

953
01:06:15,188 --> 01:06:17,494
My touch.

954
01:06:17,495 --> 01:06:22,194
I was so very alone, you see,
and I wished for comfort.

955
01:06:22,195 --> 01:06:26,329
Then a presence
and the nightmares,

956
01:06:26,330 --> 01:06:28,114
the epilepsies, I...

957
01:06:30,987 --> 01:06:32,814
Pray, continue.

958
01:06:33,946 --> 01:06:37,905
At last, Papa found
me once laying.

959
01:06:37,906 --> 01:06:40,517
Unclothed, I was.

960
01:06:40,518 --> 01:06:42,606
My body, my...

961
01:06:42,607 --> 01:06:45,696
my flesh, I...

962
01:06:45,697 --> 01:06:47,219
"Sin."

963
01:06:47,220 --> 01:06:48,873
"Sin," he said.

964
01:06:48,874 --> 01:06:51,789
He would have sent me to
that place. I... I shan't go.

965
01:06:51,790 --> 01:06:54,010
No, no.

966
01:06:55,576 --> 01:06:58,275
It all ended when I
first met my Thomas.

967
01:07:00,059 --> 01:07:02,800
From our love, I
became as normal.

968
01:07:02,801 --> 01:07:04,497
Yet these visions
and night wanderings

969
01:07:04,498 --> 01:07:05,977
have returned to you?

970
01:07:05,978 --> 01:07:08,632
I fear for him so.

971
01:07:08,633 --> 01:07:10,113
Professor.

972
01:07:11,940 --> 01:07:13,203
My dreams grow darker.

973
01:07:15,466 --> 01:07:18,338
Does evil come from
within us or from beyond?

974
01:07:21,689 --> 01:07:23,168
clock ticking

975
01:07:23,169 --> 01:07:24,778
wheezing

976
01:07:24,779 --> 01:07:26,912
VON FRANZ: Her trance
state is begun.

977
01:07:29,393 --> 01:07:32,612
You have bled her to
decrease the congestion?

978
01:07:32,613 --> 01:07:34,397
SIEVERS: Of course.

979
01:07:34,398 --> 01:07:36,703
VON FRANZ: And her
menstruations are also?

980
01:07:36,704 --> 01:07:38,575
SIEVERS: Liberal.

981
01:07:38,576 --> 01:07:41,578
VON FRANZ: Too much
blood. Too much blood.

982
01:07:41,579 --> 01:07:43,623
A taper, please.

983
01:07:43,624 --> 01:07:45,409
wheezing continues

984
01:07:48,107 --> 01:07:49,934
Her pupil is expanded.

985
01:07:49,935 --> 01:07:52,458
It does not contract
naturally to light.

986
01:07:52,459 --> 01:07:53,938
- SIEVERS: Impossible.
- VON FRANZ: A second sight.

987
01:07:53,939 --> 01:07:55,766
She is no longer here.

988
01:07:55,767 --> 01:07:57,420
My bag.

989
01:07:57,421 --> 01:07:59,944
Forgive the
grotesque tediousness

990
01:07:59,945 --> 01:08:01,815
of this demonstration.

991
01:08:01,816 --> 01:08:03,295
The needle.

992
01:08:03,296 --> 01:08:07,386
However, I must impress upon you

993
01:08:07,387 --> 01:08:11,869
that this child is not with us.

994
01:08:11,870 --> 01:08:13,479
- Anna gasps
- Professor, I do protest.

995
01:08:13,480 --> 01:08:17,353
Restrain your protestation,
for she feels nothing.

996
01:08:17,354 --> 01:08:20,270
She communes now
with another realm.

997
01:08:21,836 --> 01:08:24,795
Tend to the wound, Sievers.

998
01:08:24,796 --> 01:08:26,971
Now...

999
01:08:26,972 --> 01:08:29,539
- Do you hear me, my child?
- Ellen moans

1000
01:08:29,540 --> 01:08:31,107
And what then do you see?

1001
01:08:32,934 --> 01:08:36,633
I charge you, speak
now what you see.

1002
01:08:36,634 --> 01:08:39,462
Enduring night.

1003
01:08:39,463 --> 01:08:41,638
A specter of death.

1004
01:08:41,639 --> 01:08:46,904
He... he spreads his shadow,

1005
01:08:46,905 --> 01:08:50,908
and he... he... he is coming.

1006
01:08:50,909 --> 01:08:53,432
Who? Who is coming
to you, my child?

1007
01:08:53,433 --> 01:08:54,999
- Who, damn you? Speak!
- grunting rapidly

1008
01:08:55,000 --> 01:08:58,133
Yield before this
ancient talisman!

1009
01:08:58,134 --> 01:08:58,959
- Ellen gasping
- ANNA: Professor!

1010
01:08:58,960 --> 01:09:01,963
I will not harm her!

1011
01:09:03,226 --> 01:09:05,140
- deep, raspy breathing
- I command you,

1012
01:09:05,141 --> 01:09:08,230
hearken to my voice.

1013
01:09:08,231 --> 01:09:13,322
By the protection of
Chamuel, Haniel and Zadkiel,

1014
01:09:13,323 --> 01:09:15,846
impart your speech unto me.

1015
01:09:15,847 --> 01:09:17,456
- gagging
- In the name of Eligos,

1016
01:09:17,457 --> 01:09:19,154
Orabas and Asmoday,

1017
01:09:19,155 --> 01:09:21,808
impart your speech unto me.

1018
01:09:21,809 --> 01:09:24,724
inhales deeply

1019
01:09:24,725 --> 01:09:26,509
demonic voice: I shall
persist to join you

1020
01:09:26,510 --> 01:09:28,554
every night... first in
sleep, then in your arms.

1021
01:09:28,555 --> 01:09:30,382
Everything will be mixed

1022
01:09:30,383 --> 01:09:32,776
with abomination, and you'll
be knee-deep in blood.

1023
01:09:32,777 --> 01:09:34,430
Everyone will cry.

1024
01:09:34,431 --> 01:09:36,736
There will be none
to bury the dead.

1025
01:09:36,737 --> 01:09:40,436
- You are promised to me!
- VON FRANZ: Promised?

1026
01:09:40,437 --> 01:09:41,741
- She means her husband!
- Promised?

1027
01:09:41,742 --> 01:09:44,049
Help me! Help me!

1028
01:09:45,703 --> 01:09:47,965
thunder rumbling softly

1029
01:09:47,966 --> 01:09:49,837
As I feared.

1030
01:09:51,839 --> 01:09:53,362
Well?

1031
01:09:53,363 --> 01:09:55,581
"Well" what, my
boy? Cannot you see?

1032
01:09:55,582 --> 01:09:57,148
See what?

1033
01:09:57,149 --> 01:09:58,976
See that she is cursed.

1034
01:09:58,977 --> 01:10:00,673
- Cursed?
- Yes, cursed.

1035
01:10:00,674 --> 01:10:04,590
This dear young creature is
possessed of some spirit.

1036
01:10:04,591 --> 01:10:05,983
Perhaps a demon.

1037
01:10:05,984 --> 01:10:07,289
I beg your pardon.

1038
01:10:07,290 --> 01:10:08,638
SIEVERS: I assure
you, Harding,

1039
01:10:08,639 --> 01:10:10,161
the professor means
this as hyperbole.

1040
01:10:10,162 --> 01:10:12,990
- No, I mean a demon.
- You jest.

1041
01:10:12,991 --> 01:10:14,600
But what of your own discoveries

1042
01:10:14,601 --> 01:10:16,602
of macabre hallucination
pathologies?

1043
01:10:16,603 --> 01:10:18,387
This is not one.

1044
01:10:18,388 --> 01:10:19,997
You cannot conceivably
have perceived all of this.

1045
01:10:19,998 --> 01:10:21,521
How should this happen to Ellen?

1046
01:10:23,044 --> 01:10:26,046
Demonic spirits more
easily obsess those

1047
01:10:26,047 --> 01:10:29,049
whose lower animal
functions dominate.

1048
01:10:29,050 --> 01:10:31,400
Demons like them.
They seek them out.

1049
01:10:31,401 --> 01:10:33,445
I do not wish to
dispute you, Professor,

1050
01:10:33,446 --> 01:10:36,013
but I myself have witnessed
women of nervous constitutions

1051
01:10:36,014 --> 01:10:37,667
invent all manner of delusion.

1052
01:10:37,668 --> 01:10:39,408
This is no delusion.

1053
01:10:39,409 --> 01:10:42,237
I believe she has always
been highly conductive

1054
01:10:42,238 --> 01:10:44,804
to these cosmic
forces, uniquely so.

1055
01:10:44,805 --> 01:10:46,850
Your lunatic, perhaps.

1056
01:10:46,851 --> 01:10:49,809
Do you then acknowledge a
connection between these cases?

1057
01:10:49,810 --> 01:10:51,724
That is the question.

1058
01:10:51,725 --> 01:10:53,683
Oh, this is just capital.

1059
01:10:53,684 --> 01:10:55,728
I tell you, it is the manner
of her husband's disappearance.

1060
01:10:55,729 --> 01:10:58,731
No. This evil...

1061
01:10:58,732 --> 01:11:02,605
what it is, how it
has been summoned,

1062
01:11:02,606 --> 01:11:05,303

1063
01:11:05,304 --> 01:11:08,175

it has chained itself to

1064
01:11:08,176 --> 01:11:10,222
is in grave peril.

Sievers, no more ether.

01:26:19,739 --> 01:26:21,524
thunder rumbling

1300
01:26:24,396 --> 01:26:26,268
ELLEN: You.

1301
01:26:30,750 --> 01:26:33,926
I have felt you

1302
01:26:33,927 --> 01:26:36,539
crawling like a
serpent in my body.

1303
01:26:38,758 --> 01:26:41,196
It is not me.

1304
01:26:42,980 --> 01:26:45,677
It is your nature.

1305
01:26:45,678 --> 01:26:48,202
No. I love Thomas.

1306
01:26:48,203 --> 01:26:52,641
Love is inferior to you.

1307
01:26:52,642 --> 01:26:57,994
I told you, you are
not of humankind.

1308
01:26:57,995 --> 01:26:59,909
You are a villain to speak so.

1309
01:26:59,910 --> 01:27:03,391
I am an appetite.

1310
01:27:03,392 --> 01:27:05,436
Nothing more.

1311
01:27:05,437 --> 01:27:07,396
inhales deeply

1312
01:27:09,136 --> 01:27:14,184
O'er centuries,
a loathsome beast

1313
01:27:14,185 --> 01:27:19,234
I lay within the darkest pit.

1314
01:27:21,758 --> 01:27:27,415
Till you did wake
me, enchantress,

1315
01:27:27,416 --> 01:27:29,939
and stirred me from my grave.

1316
01:27:29,940 --> 01:27:35,249
You are my affliction.

1317
01:27:35,250 --> 01:27:37,948
I care nothing of
your afflictions.

1318
01:27:39,166 --> 01:27:44,084
Yet even now we are fated.

1319
01:27:45,347 --> 01:27:48,392
Your husband has signed his name

1320
01:27:48,393 --> 01:27:51,308
and covenanted you to my person

1321
01:27:51,309 --> 01:27:54,268
for but a sack of gold.

1322
01:27:54,269 --> 01:27:56,313
- Lies.
- For gold,

1323
01:27:56,314 --> 01:27:59,621
he did absolve his nuptial bond.

1324
01:27:59,622 --> 01:28:01,666
You know nothing of him.

1325
01:28:01,667 --> 01:28:05,757
And the resignation
must be completed by you

1326
01:28:05,758 --> 01:28:08,804
freely of thine own will.

1327
01:28:08,805 --> 01:28:10,240
You are a deceiver.

1328
01:28:10,241 --> 01:28:14,289
You deceive yourself.

1329
01:28:16,029 --> 01:28:18,204
I was but an innocent child.

1330
01:28:18,205 --> 01:28:22,774
And thought you I
would not return?

1331
01:28:22,775 --> 01:28:26,126
Thought you I would not?

1332
01:28:28,041 --> 01:28:33,177
Your passion is bound to me.

1333
01:28:35,832 --> 01:28:38,921
You cannot love.

1334
01:28:38,922 --> 01:28:42,186
I cannot.

1335
01:28:43,753 --> 01:28:48,627
Yet I cannot be
sated without you.

1336
01:28:51,848 --> 01:28:55,677
Remember how once we were?

1337
01:28:55,678 --> 01:28:59,985
A moment. Remember?

1338
01:28:59,986 --> 01:29:02,162
both breathing deeply

1339
01:29:03,860 --> 01:29:08,733
I abhor you.

1340
01:29:08,734 --> 01:29:11,215
You are false!

1341
01:29:12,695 --> 01:29:16,132
So you wish me to prove
my enmity as well?

1342
01:29:16,133 --> 01:29:20,310
I will leave you three nights.

1343
01:29:20,311 --> 01:29:22,878
Tonight was the first.

1344
01:29:22,879 --> 01:29:25,489
Tonight you denied yourself,

1345
01:29:25,490 --> 01:29:28,318
and thereby, you suffer me

1346
01:29:28,319 --> 01:29:31,234
to vanish up the lives
of those you love.

1347
01:29:31,235 --> 01:29:33,062
Denied myself?

1348
01:29:33,063 --> 01:29:35,194
You revel in my torture.

1349
01:29:35,195 --> 01:29:40,156
Upon the third night,
you will submit,

1350
01:29:40,157 --> 01:29:43,072
or he you call your husband

1351
01:29:43,073 --> 01:29:45,857
shall perish by my hand.

1352
01:29:45,858 --> 01:29:47,381
No.

1353
01:29:47,382 --> 01:29:50,558
Till you bid me come

1354
01:29:50,559 --> 01:29:55,127
shall you watch the
world become as naught.

1355
01:29:55,128 --> 01:29:56,912
- No!
- shrieks

1356
01:29:56,913 --> 01:29:58,741
rapid, gasping breaths

1357
01:30:02,048 --> 01:30:04,572
trembling breaths nearby

1358
01:30:04,573 --> 01:30:07,358
- Anna moaning
- rats squeaking

1359
01:30:25,811 --> 01:30:27,509
screaming

1360
01:30:34,037 --> 01:30:38,257
Two more nights.

1361
01:30:38,258 --> 01:30:40,434
- screaming
- frantic chatter

1362
01:30:40,435 --> 01:30:42,305
NURSE: I ain't
never seen the like.

1363
01:30:42,306 --> 01:30:44,655
It's been a-spreading faster
than wildfire since yestermorn.

1364
01:30:44,656 --> 01:30:46,875
We simply cannot admit any more.

1365
01:30:46,876 --> 01:30:49,138
The contraction
rate is too high.

1366
01:30:49,139 --> 01:30:51,445
I've entreated the
burgomaster for a quarantine.

1367
01:30:51,446 --> 01:30:53,925
- The city must be shut up.
- It ain't Christian.

1368
01:30:53,926 --> 01:30:55,666
We can find rooms, sir.

1369
01:30:55,667 --> 01:30:58,060
The day of judgment's
a-coming, sir. Take pity.

1370
01:30:58,061 --> 01:31:01,238
SIEVERS: We must remain calm
in the face of this plague.

1371
01:31:02,195 --> 01:31:04,240
inhales sharply

1372
01:31:04,241 --> 01:31:07,939
breathing heavily:
A shadow pressing.

1373
01:31:07,940 --> 01:31:10,638
My body sinking.

1374
01:31:10,639 --> 01:31:12,292
Sinking.

1375
01:31:14,033 --> 01:31:15,425
whimpers

1376
01:31:15,426 --> 01:31:17,688
The smell of rancid meat.

1377
01:31:17,689 --> 01:31:19,777
whimpers, inhales deeply

1378
01:31:19,778 --> 01:31:21,039
Suffocating.

1379
01:31:21,040 --> 01:31:22,954
gasping

1380
01:31:22,955 --> 01:31:25,130
I...

1381
01:31:25,131 --> 01:31:28,264
I feel so weak. I...

1382
01:31:28,265 --> 01:31:30,485
laughing

1383
01:31:32,487 --> 01:31:35,663
I fear little
Friedrich is so strong,

1384
01:31:35,664 --> 01:31:38,623
so hungry he is eating me weary.

1385
01:31:40,582 --> 01:31:42,584
short, gasping breaths

1386
01:31:44,586 --> 01:31:47,022
May I... may I see the girls?

1387
01:31:47,023 --> 01:31:49,459
giggling

1388
01:31:49,460 --> 01:31:51,722
I must assure them...

1389
01:31:51,723 --> 01:31:54,377
sobbing softly

1390
01:31:54,378 --> 01:31:56,684
Everything will be
well, my darling.

1391
01:31:56,685 --> 01:31:59,339
Everything shall be just fine.

1392
01:32:00,471 --> 01:32:02,820
I don't know myself.

Ellen, tell me,

01:32:09,828 --> 01:32:13,091
what is this
insufferable darkness?

Herr Harding, you must see me.

1400
01:32:28,499 --> 01:32:30,021
There is something.

1401
01:32:30,022 --> 01:32:32,197
The shadow, an
infernal creature.

1402
01:32:32,198 --> 01:32:33,764
- Ellen.
- Please!

1403
01:32:33,765 --> 01:32:35,461
These are no troubled nerves.

1404
01:32:35,462 --> 01:32:38,073
It is as Professor Franz
described... a demon.

1405
01:32:38,074 --> 01:32:41,685
Frau Hutter, forgive me,
but I need you and Thomas...

1406
01:32:41,686 --> 01:32:43,818
both of you... to return home.

1407
01:32:43,819 --> 01:32:45,428
What?

1408
01:32:45,429 --> 01:32:47,256
It's for your own sake.

1409
01:32:47,257 --> 01:32:48,910
Please.

1410
01:32:48,911 --> 01:32:50,912
Have pity. Thomas
is very poorly.

1411
01:32:50,913 --> 01:32:52,609
I know not what I...

1412
01:32:52,610 --> 01:32:54,873
I shall pray for Tom.

1413
01:32:56,483 --> 01:32:58,572
- You know I love you both.
- What of Anna?

1414
01:32:58,573 --> 01:33:00,791
Did you not see her?

1415
01:33:00,792 --> 01:33:02,445
It's none of your concern.

1416
01:33:02,446 --> 01:33:04,316
Friedrich, you
must listen to me.

1417
01:33:04,317 --> 01:33:05,317
We're all in the
most grave danger.

1418
01:33:05,318 --> 01:33:08,146
I throw myself at your feet!

1419
01:33:08,147 --> 01:33:09,714
Frau Hutter, please!

1420
01:33:13,588 --> 01:33:15,720
Why do you hate me?

1421
01:33:18,549 --> 01:33:22,639
How dare you speak to me
in that marked manner?

1422
01:33:22,640 --> 01:33:24,467
You have never liked me. Never.

1423
01:33:24,468 --> 01:33:26,164
Know your place, madam.

1424
01:33:26,165 --> 01:33:29,211
I will not stand by and
pretend at your superiority.

1425
01:33:29,212 --> 01:33:30,821
I refuse to exchange

1426
01:33:30,822 --> 01:33:32,431
- reproaches with you.
- Why can you not hear me?

1427
01:33:32,432 --> 01:33:33,911
Listen to me, please!

1428
01:33:33,912 --> 01:33:35,783
I have done
everything in my power

1429
01:33:35,784 --> 01:33:37,741
to be kind to you in
these long months.

1430
01:33:37,742 --> 01:33:38,917
Tied me up.

1431
01:33:43,095 --> 01:33:47,621
Find the dignity to display
the respect to your caretaker.

1432
01:33:47,622 --> 01:33:50,059
How can you be so
stupid and cruel?

1433
01:33:52,409 --> 01:33:55,324
Hartmann will call you a coach.

1434
01:33:55,325 --> 01:33:57,632
My expense, of course.

1435
01:33:59,111 --> 01:34:02,113
And for your husband's
sake, I pray you learn

1436
01:34:02,114 --> 01:34:04,246
to conduct yourself
with more deference.

1437
01:34:04,247 --> 01:34:06,248
Anna is going to die.

1438
01:34:06,249 --> 01:34:08,337
You are going to die!

1439
01:34:08,338 --> 01:34:11,341
We're all going to die!

1440
01:34:12,864 --> 01:34:15,257
Why did you not tell
me of this before?

1441
01:34:15,258 --> 01:34:16,475
SIEVERS: I am a fool.

1442
01:34:16,476 --> 01:34:18,129
Of course it is Herr Knock.

1443
01:34:18,130 --> 01:34:20,175
His obsessive consumption
of living creatures...

1444
01:34:20,176 --> 01:34:21,480
it must be him.

1445
01:34:21,481 --> 01:34:24,135
He is not Nosferatu.

1446
01:34:24,136 --> 01:34:26,181
But he must be found,

1447
01:34:26,182 --> 01:34:29,751
for he has made compact
with this shadow.

1448

indistinct chatter,

I sent them home.

How can this
perversion be killed?

1470
01:36:10,112 --> 01:36:11,721
I do not know. You
sent them home?

- You sent them home?

1472

No, not that. Yes, I did.

You don't know?

1474
01:36:16,074 --> 01:36:17,248
Precisely. Correct.

1475
01:36:17,249 --> 01:36:18,859
I do not know.

1476
01:36:18,860 --> 01:36:21,471
I have never encountered
Nosferatu firsthand.

1477
01:36:23,429 --> 01:36:24,779
He doesn't know.

1478
01:36:26,215 --> 01:36:29,173
All your fine lectures

- Assuredly.
- Under our very noses.

1688

Tonight, we destroy the beast.

1689
01:47:50,594 --> 01:47:52,421

- No, of course not, Ellen.

1690

Please. The readiness is all.

1693
01:47:58,689 --> 01:48:01,735
We shall sanctify the
earth wherein he is buried

1694
01:48:01,736 --> 01:48:03,911
and destroy the sarcophagus.

1695
01:48:03,912 --> 01:48:06,261

sanctuary at cock crow.

1696

And when we uncover the body?

1697
01:48:08,743 --> 01:48:12,833
I will drive a spike of
cold iron through him.

- It must.

It is a rare gift.

1704

1705

1706

within ourselves.

1709

crucify the evil within us,

1710
