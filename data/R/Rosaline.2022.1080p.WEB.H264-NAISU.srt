1
00:01:08,625 --> 00:01:09,625
Romeo?

2
00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:27,125
To gaze upon you is like
drinking from the purest fountain.

3
00:01:29,500 --> 00:01:33,250
The fairest stars in heaven
do entreat your eyes.

4
00:01:33,333 --> 00:01:34,333
Oh, Romeo.

5
00:01:34,833 --> 00:01:40,375
Forswear it, sight,
I never saw true beauty until this night.

6
00:01:43,083 --> 00:01:44,833
Uh, Romeo?

7
00:01:44,917 --> 00:01:45,917
Yes, my love?

8
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,500
Why are you talking like that?

9
00:01:49,208 --> 00:01:53,000
Oh, um... I... I...
I felt like it sounded romantic.

10
00:01:53,542 --> 00:01:54,792
- Oh.
- Don't you like it?

11
00:01:54,875 --> 00:01:57,458
Um... Yeah, actually. It's kinda nice.

12
00:01:58,083 --> 00:02:00,750
Then by yonder blessed moon, I vow.
I shall speaketh...

13
00:02:00,833 --> 00:02:03,875
- Oh! Okay!
- Uh... Oh! Oh!

14
00:02:03,958 --> 00:02:05,458
- Are you okay?
- I... No.

15
00:02:05,542 --> 00:02:06,542
- Um…
- Okay.

16
00:02:11,250 --> 00:02:13,125
- I'm okay. I'm okay. Yeah.
- Nice.

17
00:02:13,667 --> 00:02:15,708
- God, I missed you.
- I missed you too.

18
00:02:15,792 --> 00:02:17,583
You're the most beautiful woman
in all of Verona.

19
00:02:17,667 --> 00:02:19,458
- Yes, keep talking.
- We're the most perfect pair.

20
00:02:19,542 --> 00:02:20,375
Yes, don't stop.

21
00:02:20,458 --> 00:02:22,458
They will be saying our names
for centuries.

22
00:02:22,542 --> 00:02:24,042
- Oh, what will they say?
- They will say,

23
00:02:24,125 --> 00:02:28,292
"Never were two hearts more destined
to entwine than those of the lovers…"

24
00:02:28,375 --> 00:02:30,417
- Yes. Yes.
- "…Romeo and..."

25
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:32,542
Rosaline?

26
00:02:32,625 --> 00:02:33,708
- Shit.
- What do we do?

27
00:02:33,792 --> 00:02:35,083
- My father.
- I don't know what to do.

28
00:02:35,167 --> 00:02:36,333
- You need to go. Hide.
- Right.

29
00:02:36,417 --> 00:02:38,792
- Um. Um.
- Uh… Oh.

30
00:02:39,625 --> 00:02:40,917
Rosaline!

31
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Father?

32
00:02:46,542 --> 00:02:48,167
I thought I heard voices.

33
00:02:49,833 --> 00:02:52,875
Oh. I was, uh...
I was in the commode.

34
00:02:54,458 --> 00:02:55,583
Talking to yourself?

35
00:02:56,292 --> 00:02:57,292
It helps.

36
00:02:58,542 --> 00:03:00,375
Huh. I have the opposite problem...

37
00:03:01,083 --> 00:03:04,750
Sorry. Where were we?

38
00:03:07,333 --> 00:03:08,333
Um…

39
00:03:09,333 --> 00:03:12,208
For I... Oh,
they were saying our names for centuries.

40
00:03:12,292 --> 00:03:14,833
Except, how can
they say our names for centuries if...

41
00:03:15,375 --> 00:03:17,208
If... If... Um, what?

42
00:03:18,583 --> 00:03:20,708
If we'll always be a secret?

43
00:03:21,208 --> 00:03:23,125
We won't. We won't always be a secret.

44
00:03:23,208 --> 00:03:26,042
You're a Montague. I'm a Capulet.

45
00:03:26,125 --> 00:03:28,458
Our families have been enemies
for generations.

46
00:03:28,542 --> 00:03:32,458
Rosaline, we will make this work,
I promise.

47
00:03:32,542 --> 00:03:36,958
One day, we will be together forever.

48
00:03:37,042 --> 00:03:38,125
Forever.

49
00:03:41,458 --> 00:03:43,542
- Good night, Romeo.
- Good night, Rosaline.

50
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:47,917
A thousand times good night.

51
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:48,958
Nice one!

52
00:03:53,458 --> 00:03:55,583
Romeo and Rosaline.

53
00:03:57,667 --> 00:03:58,667
Hmm.

54
00:04:00,208 --> 00:04:01,625
Does have a nice ring to it.

55
00:04:12,750 --> 00:04:15,417
- Rise and shine, love!
- Romeo.

56
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Oh, another late night, was it?

57
00:04:18,083 --> 00:04:19,792
Oh, bloody hell.

58
00:04:20,292 --> 00:04:21,917
Are you trying to ruin me?

59
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,375
I thought you were cool
with my sneaking around.

60
00:04:24,458 --> 00:04:28,000
Sneaking around? Yes. Getting caught? No.

61
00:04:28,083 --> 00:04:30,875
Cover your tracks, woman, please.

62
00:04:30,958 --> 00:04:31,958
Sorry.

63
00:04:33,083 --> 00:04:34,750
Although…

64
00:04:34,833 --> 00:04:38,167
If I could date who I wanted to date,
read what I wanted to read,

65
00:04:38,250 --> 00:04:41,083
there wouldn't be so much sneaking around
in the first place.

66
00:04:41,167 --> 00:04:42,167
Would there, Nurse?

67
00:04:42,250 --> 00:04:43,167
So unfair.

68
00:04:43,250 --> 00:04:46,292
Right, well,
I went to nursing school for seven years,

69
00:04:46,375 --> 00:04:47,750
and now this is what I do for a living.

70
00:04:47,833 --> 00:04:49,417
So, yeah, life is unfair.

71
00:04:50,458 --> 00:04:52,250
By the way, that's what I call covert.

72
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:55,708
Oh, my God.

73
00:04:56,208 --> 00:04:57,750
Nurse.

74
00:04:57,833 --> 00:05:00,792
Right, let's get you dressed.
You have lunch at noon.

75
00:05:00,875 --> 00:05:03,417
Noon? Then why did you wake me so early?

76
00:05:04,292 --> 00:05:08,000
'Cause your dad wants you
to wear this behemoth again.

77
00:05:11,667 --> 00:05:13,667
No, get up, you lazy cow. Come on.

78
00:05:13,750 --> 00:05:16,375
You can't live in this house forever,
Rosaline.

79
00:05:16,458 --> 00:05:20,167
Your sisters are all off and married,
and now it's your turn.

80
00:05:20,250 --> 00:05:21,583
I'm too young to get married.

81
00:05:21,667 --> 00:05:22,958
- Too young?
- Yeah.

82
00:05:23,042 --> 00:05:24,042
Look at you.

83
00:05:24,625 --> 00:05:25,875
You're almost too old.

84
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:29,542
Your mother had three kids
when she was your age.

85
00:05:29,625 --> 00:05:31,333
And don't you think she wanted more,
Father?

86
00:05:31,417 --> 00:05:34,083
Of course she did. That's why we had you.

87
00:05:35,792 --> 00:05:38,958
So, your father's told me all about you.

88
00:05:39,042 --> 00:05:43,000
He even said that you wanted a career.
Is that right?

89
00:05:43,083 --> 00:05:45,167
Yeah, I intend to be a cartographer.

90
00:05:45,250 --> 00:05:49,167
A cartographer?

91
00:05:49,250 --> 00:05:51,292
That... That's adorable.

92
00:05:51,792 --> 00:05:55,042
My third wife had an ambition once.

93
00:05:55,750 --> 00:05:57,250
Didn't care for it on her.

94
00:05:57,333 --> 00:05:58,458
Mother of God.

95
00:05:58,542 --> 00:06:01,500
But she wasn't as pretty as you are.

96
00:06:02,792 --> 00:06:03,792
You know...

97
00:06:05,458 --> 00:06:09,292
If my father told you so much about me,
Mr. Danieli…

98
00:06:11,167 --> 00:06:13,042
…he must have mentioned Josephine.

99
00:06:13,542 --> 00:06:15,000
Wherever I go, she goes.

100
00:06:16,042 --> 00:06:17,125
- Oh.
- Yeah.

101
00:06:17,625 --> 00:06:21,250
Well... Well,
when do I get to meet this Josephine?

102
00:06:21,333 --> 00:06:22,333
What do you mean?

103
00:06:23,417 --> 00:06:24,875
She's sitting right there.

104
00:06:28,875 --> 00:06:31,500
Josephine! No!
Take that out of your mouth right now!

105
00:06:31,583 --> 00:06:34,333
Take it! Put it down!
We've been over this!

106
00:06:44,333 --> 00:06:47,625
Just… wasn't into me, I guess.

107
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:54,333
Ah, that's right.
You wanna marry for love.

108
00:06:54,417 --> 00:06:55,750
Is there any other reason?

109
00:06:56,250 --> 00:07:01,125
Mmm. Money, status, land,
nicer living quarters.

110
00:07:01,708 --> 00:07:03,250
No, no other reason.

111
00:07:04,417 --> 00:07:05,833
We get one life, Paris.

112
00:07:06,333 --> 00:07:11,500
I want mine to be different.
I want romance, passion, adventure.

113
00:07:11,583 --> 00:07:12,708
Mm-hmm.

114
00:07:13,417 --> 00:07:15,417
And this mystery boy, he gives you that?

115
00:07:16,292 --> 00:07:18,125
Mm-hmm.

116
00:07:18,625 --> 00:07:19,625
What?

117
00:07:19,708 --> 00:07:23,500
I just wonder if all this sneaking around
is adding to the attraction.

118
00:07:23,583 --> 00:07:25,083
Because, in my experience,

119
00:07:25,167 --> 00:07:29,000
I've often found that it's pretty easy
to mistake danger and drama

120
00:07:29,083 --> 00:07:30,750
for romantic passion.

121
00:07:30,833 --> 00:07:33,250
But also, I mean,
who doesn't love a secret?

122
00:07:33,333 --> 00:07:35,958
To live in a world of your own making,
just the two of you.

123
00:07:47,875 --> 00:07:49,750
Uh... Okay.

124
00:07:49,833 --> 00:07:51,542
Romeo! Hey, man.

125
00:07:52,292 --> 00:07:53,292
Come on.

126
00:08:14,667 --> 00:08:16,292
Stand back, coz!

127
00:08:18,292 --> 00:08:21,792
You're surrounded by Montagues.

128
00:08:21,875 --> 00:08:25,208
You might catch something.

129
00:08:25,292 --> 00:08:26,583
They weren't even doing anything.

130
00:08:26,667 --> 00:08:28,917
Not yet, they weren't.

131
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,042
We don't want any trouble, Tybalt.

132
00:08:31,125 --> 00:08:35,042
"Oh, we don't want any trouble,
Tybalt."

133
00:08:35,125 --> 00:08:39,000
Then, you should go back to
your side of town where you belong.

134
00:08:39,083 --> 00:08:41,708
Why don't you and your, uh,
boy band meet us there?

135
00:08:41,792 --> 00:08:43,083
Maybe we will.

136
00:08:43,667 --> 00:08:45,000
You're welcome there any time.

137
00:08:45,083 --> 00:08:48,708
How about I welcome my fist to your face?

138
00:08:49,208 --> 00:08:53,917
I don't know what that means.

139
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,417
It means I'm going to punch you!

140
00:08:56,500 --> 00:09:00,667
Oh! Whoa!

141
00:09:06,875 --> 00:09:09,833
- Ho! Oh, oh, oh!
- Okay. Okay. All right. All right.

142
00:09:09,917 --> 00:09:12,167
You all have big swords.

143
00:09:12,667 --> 00:09:15,167
How about putting them
back in your pants now, yeah?

144
00:09:15,250 --> 00:09:16,583
Come on. Let's go.

145
00:09:19,583 --> 00:09:23,167
Benvolio, Mercutio, let's go.

146
00:09:24,167 --> 00:09:27,833
Girl, that is one tasty Montague.

147
00:09:27,917 --> 00:09:29,250
Can I tell you a secret?

148
00:09:42,125 --> 00:09:43,292
For you.

149
00:09:45,208 --> 00:09:46,667
I engraved it myself.

150
00:09:49,958 --> 00:09:51,708
I shall wear it always.

151
00:09:52,333 --> 00:09:53,333
Okay.

152
00:10:01,417 --> 00:10:03,208
I'm sorry about my cousin.

153
00:10:03,292 --> 00:10:04,500
Oh, well, you know…

154
00:10:04,583 --> 00:10:07,167
I just wish we could live far,
far away from here.

155
00:10:07,792 --> 00:10:09,000
Where would we live?

156
00:10:09,083 --> 00:10:10,375
On a mountaintop.

157
00:10:10,458 --> 00:10:11,333
In a cabin.

158
00:10:11,417 --> 00:10:12,542
Made of wood.

159
00:10:12,625 --> 00:10:15,500
Kinda sounds perfect.
I could write poetry all day.

160
00:10:15,583 --> 00:10:17,375
Oh, you'll be such a gifted poet.

161
00:10:17,458 --> 00:10:19,500
You could keep the house
and watch the children.

162
00:10:19,583 --> 00:10:20,583
Yes.

163
00:10:22,458 --> 00:10:23,792
Wait. What?

164
00:10:23,875 --> 00:10:25,167
Hmm?

165
00:10:25,667 --> 00:10:30,750
Uh, sorry. While you're off writing verse,
I'm home changing diapers?

166
00:10:31,750 --> 00:10:34,750
Well,
the point is that we would be together…

167
00:10:35,750 --> 00:10:41,250
In public, away from our families
and-and-and all of this hate.

168
00:10:43,167 --> 00:10:44,750
- Right.
- Yeah.

169
00:10:44,833 --> 00:10:45,958
- Right.
- Yeah.

170
00:10:46,042 --> 00:10:48,417
Yes. Okay. Okay.

171
00:10:50,292 --> 00:10:51,333
I love you.

172
00:10:55,750 --> 00:10:59,250
Do you love me too?

173
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:05,667
- Oh.
- It's just...

174
00:11:05,750 --> 00:11:06,583
- Fine.
- Sorry.

175
00:11:06,667 --> 00:11:09,375
I... I... I wasn't expecting that.
It's just no one's ever really…

176
00:11:09,458 --> 00:11:11,125
I should probably go. Um...

177
00:11:11,208 --> 00:11:15,958
I... I, um... There's the guards, like,
everywhere tonight, so it's not safe.

178
00:11:16,042 --> 00:11:16,875
No.

179
00:11:16,958 --> 00:11:20,292
I'm just... Just get going
so I don't get captured by the guards.

180
00:11:20,375 --> 00:11:23,500
Romeo, wait. The Capulet Ball is tomorrow.

181
00:11:23,583 --> 00:11:26,167
Rosaline, you know
I can't be seen at any Capulet ga...

182
00:11:26,250 --> 00:11:27,833
It's a masquerade ball.

183
00:11:29,375 --> 00:11:32,917
We could dance together,
and no one will know that it's us.

184
00:11:36,542 --> 00:11:37,542
I'll be there.

185
00:11:38,458 --> 00:11:40,333
Great. I can't wait.

186
00:11:41,833 --> 00:11:44,500
A thousand times can't wait?

187
00:11:45,542 --> 00:11:47,792
I've been waiting for him to
say those words.

188
00:11:47,875 --> 00:11:51,417
And then he finally does,
and I just freeze like an idiot.

189
00:11:52,250 --> 00:11:53,833
I don't know what's wrong with me, Nurse.

190
00:11:53,917 --> 00:11:55,708
There's nothing wrong with you, chicken.

191
00:11:55,792 --> 00:11:59,625
They're not easy words to say.
You know, unless you mean them.

192
00:12:00,125 --> 00:12:01,625
I... Of course I mean them.

193
00:12:01,708 --> 00:12:03,375
- That beak all right?
- Yes.

194
00:12:04,167 --> 00:12:05,542
It's okay.

195
00:12:06,083 --> 00:12:07,750
Tonight, I'll make it up to him.

196
00:12:07,833 --> 00:12:09,958
We'll dance. We'll sing. We'll kiss.

197
00:12:10,042 --> 00:12:11,750
Everything will be back to normal.

198
00:12:11,833 --> 00:12:13,500
I have wonderful news.

199
00:12:13,583 --> 00:12:17,292
Just when we thought we had run out of
eligible bachelors in Verona,

200
00:12:17,375 --> 00:12:19,792
a family has arrived from the north.

201
00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:21,750
The Penzas.

202
00:12:21,833 --> 00:12:27,542
And lucky for us, they have a son
who has just returned from the war intact.

203
00:12:28,083 --> 00:12:30,125
Wonderful! You marry him.

204
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,250
That must be him.

205
00:12:34,125 --> 00:12:35,125
Wait.

206
00:12:35,208 --> 00:12:36,958
- Now?
- Now.

207
00:12:37,042 --> 00:12:38,708
I'd rather eat rotten goat innards!

208
00:12:38,792 --> 00:12:40,667
I have
a really good feeling. No, Rosaline.

209
00:12:40,750 --> 00:12:42,708
I'd rather bathe in the filth
of ten thousand mules.

210
00:12:42,792 --> 00:12:44,833
- Just give him a chance.
- No.

211
00:12:44,917 --> 00:12:45,917
Rosaline.

212
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
How many times
do I have to tell you, Father?

213
00:12:48,083 --> 00:12:50,333
I don't want an arranged marriage.

214
00:12:50,417 --> 00:12:55,000
I wanna travel the world,
be free, have adventures,

215
00:12:55,083 --> 00:12:57,208
and with someone that I actually love.

216
00:12:57,292 --> 00:12:58,625
You're a woman.

217
00:12:58,708 --> 00:13:01,083
You're not supposed to talk about
what you want.

218
00:13:05,708 --> 00:13:11,167
Dario Penza, may I present to you
my beautiful daughter, Rosaline.

219
00:13:14,542 --> 00:13:15,667
Hello.

220
00:13:15,750 --> 00:13:18,000
Whatever.

221
00:13:18,083 --> 00:13:19,083
Have a good time.

222
00:13:26,125 --> 00:13:27,458
Shall we?

223
00:13:37,375 --> 00:13:40,875
- So, how do you like living in Ver...
- Let me stop you right there, soldier boy.

224
00:13:41,375 --> 00:13:42,375
- Soldier boy?
- Now, granted,

225
00:13:42,458 --> 00:13:45,583
you are a big step up
from the toothless octogenarians

226
00:13:45,667 --> 00:13:47,833
my father usually tries to pawn me off on…

227
00:13:49,833 --> 00:13:51,958
But the fact remains:

228
00:13:52,042 --> 00:13:55,958
I have literally no interest in you or in
this whole arranged marriage business.

229
00:13:56,042 --> 00:13:57,500
No matter how many acres of land

230
00:13:57,583 --> 00:13:59,583
or special breed of horse
your father's offering.

231
00:13:59,667 --> 00:14:00,625
Cow.

232
00:14:00,708 --> 00:14:01,708
Excuse me?

233
00:14:01,792 --> 00:14:03,292
He's offering a cow.

234
00:14:03,375 --> 00:14:05,292
That's about it, I'm afraid.
We're not rich.

235
00:14:05,375 --> 00:14:06,625
Well, whoop-de-do.

236
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:09,708
- If I was you, I'd take the deal.
- Would you?

237
00:14:09,792 --> 00:14:12,958
Yeah.
I have some land, some prospects.

238
00:14:13,542 --> 00:14:15,042
I have all my teeth.

239
00:14:15,625 --> 00:14:16,917
Could do a lot worse.

240
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,042
Well, you're not really my type.

241
00:14:19,125 --> 00:14:20,333
You're not exactly my type either.

242
00:14:20,417 --> 00:14:22,417
Hmm. And what is your type, Suede City?

243
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:24,500
Oh, my type is not a shrew.

244
00:14:25,083 --> 00:14:25,958
Blow me.

245
00:14:28,125 --> 00:14:31,333
Well, we're here.

246
00:14:33,250 --> 00:14:36,042
Um, what's this now?

247
00:14:36,542 --> 00:14:39,958
Yeah, she's a beaut, isn't she?

248
00:14:40,958 --> 00:14:43,167
Yeah, that's not happening.

249
00:14:44,750 --> 00:14:45,750
And why is that?

250
00:14:47,708 --> 00:14:49,292
I have...

251
00:14:49,375 --> 00:14:51,875
There's... It's...
It doesn't look safe. Mmm.

252
00:14:51,958 --> 00:14:55,500
I was master helmsman of a six-sail
car rack. I assure you she's plenty safe.

253
00:14:55,583 --> 00:14:56,875
What if there's a storm?

254
00:14:56,958 --> 00:14:58,417
Do you see any storm clouds?

255
00:14:58,917 --> 00:15:02,583
What if I have to go to the bathroom, hmm?

256
00:15:06,458 --> 00:15:08,917
Oh. Oh, I see.

257
00:15:09,458 --> 00:15:11,458
- What do you see?
- No, you're afraid.

258
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,750
What?

259
00:15:13,833 --> 00:15:15,542
- No, I'm not.
- I can see it in your face.

260
00:15:15,625 --> 00:15:17,125
No, I am not.

261
00:15:17,208 --> 00:15:19,958
Look at the big tough girl
afraid of the water.

262
00:15:20,042 --> 00:15:22,333
I am not afraid of the "water."

263
00:15:22,417 --> 00:15:23,375
That's ridiculous.

264
00:15:27,458 --> 00:15:29,042
I'm afraid of the fish.

265
00:15:30,250 --> 00:15:32,375
- All of them?
- Yeah, it's a real thing.

266
00:15:32,458 --> 00:15:33,917
Ichthyophobia. Look it up.

267
00:15:34,417 --> 00:15:36,583
- All fish?
- Okay, that's good.

268
00:15:36,667 --> 00:15:38,917
- Oh, this must be a nightmare for you.
- All right, fine. I'll go.

269
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,708
I'll go on your stupid boat.

270
00:15:41,208 --> 00:15:42,042
Fantastic.

271
00:15:42,125 --> 00:15:44,917
I have somewhere I have to be.
So, 30 minutes max.

272
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,167
- Would you like a hand?
- No!

273
00:15:46,250 --> 00:15:48,833
Okay. Watch out for the... Sorry.

274
00:15:50,375 --> 00:15:51,375
You got it.

275
00:15:57,708 --> 00:16:02,042
Okay, just... Whoa. Whoa. Okay.

276
00:16:02,125 --> 00:16:03,292
This is gonna be fun.

277
00:16:26,750 --> 00:16:27,750
Rosaline? No.

278
00:16:31,542 --> 00:16:32,542
Rosaline?

279
00:16:34,750 --> 00:16:35,750
Rosaline?

280
00:16:50,375 --> 00:16:51,667
Lucky knife.

281
00:16:51,750 --> 00:16:53,083
Do you hunt?

282
00:16:54,417 --> 00:16:55,542
Yeah, I hunt.

283
00:16:55,625 --> 00:16:58,458
Huh. Yeah, I grew up on a farm
just north of here.

284
00:16:58,542 --> 00:17:02,625
Some chickens, some cows,
a very moody goat.

285
00:17:02,708 --> 00:17:03,542
Yeah.

286
00:17:03,625 --> 00:17:05,792
And my mum,
she taught me how to cook even before I...

287
00:17:05,875 --> 00:17:07,000
I have a boyfriend.

288
00:17:09,625 --> 00:17:10,625
You do?

289
00:17:11,833 --> 00:17:15,875
Yeah,
and he's waiting for me right this minute.

290
00:17:15,958 --> 00:17:18,125
So we just really need to be
getting going and...

291
00:17:18,208 --> 00:17:20,500
Your father never mentioned any boyfriend.

292
00:17:22,458 --> 00:17:25,042
He doesn't know.

293
00:17:25,125 --> 00:17:27,583
Well, you could've just told me that
in the first place.

294
00:17:27,667 --> 00:17:28,667
We'll get you back.

295
00:17:36,625 --> 00:17:38,083
Uh-oh.

296
00:17:38,667 --> 00:17:39,667
Uh-oh?

297
00:17:43,875 --> 00:17:44,875
What?

298
00:17:45,375 --> 00:17:46,375
Oh, my God.

299
00:17:46,458 --> 00:17:47,583
What?

300
00:17:47,667 --> 00:17:49,333
We can't go back in this!

301
00:17:49,417 --> 00:17:50,833
We'll have to wait it out!

302
00:17:51,833 --> 00:17:54,000
But we must go back!

303
00:17:54,500 --> 00:17:56,833
The ball started an hour ago!

304
00:18:08,042 --> 00:18:10,458
You're getting drenched.
Come sit down.

305
00:18:10,542 --> 00:18:12,083
You said it wasn't gonna storm!

306
00:18:12,167 --> 00:18:14,208
I'm a soldier, not a weatherman.

307
00:18:15,292 --> 00:18:16,458
I hope you're happy.

308
00:18:16,542 --> 00:18:17,542
I'm not.

309
00:18:19,583 --> 00:18:21,708
Stop smiling.

310
00:18:26,792 --> 00:18:28,708
Yeah, we're going backwards.

311
00:18:33,708 --> 00:18:35,042
- Hey.
- Oh.

312
00:18:35,917 --> 00:18:38,833
Um, I'm so sorry...

313
00:18:38,917 --> 00:18:42,667
I, um, I'm... No, all right.

314
00:18:42,750 --> 00:18:43,875
Who was that?

315
00:18:50,750 --> 00:18:52,125
Great.

316
00:18:55,500 --> 00:18:56,500
- Oh!
- Oh, oh.

317
00:18:56,583 --> 00:18:58,792
- Oh, I'm so sorry.
- Excuse me.

318
00:19:02,542 --> 00:19:04,292
My... My bad.

319
00:19:05,917 --> 00:19:06,917
It's okay.

320
00:19:14,542 --> 00:19:17,042
H-Hi. I'm Romeo.

321
00:19:21,417 --> 00:19:22,917
Juliet.

322
00:19:31,875 --> 00:19:34,458
This has literally been
the worst night of my life.

323
00:19:34,542 --> 00:19:36,750
The feeling's more than mutual.

324
00:19:40,667 --> 00:19:41,667
Thanks for nothing.

325
00:19:41,750 --> 00:19:43,167
Yeah, right there with you.

326
00:19:43,250 --> 00:19:46,833
Actually, the pancetta wasn't terrible,
so thank you for that. But only for that.

327
00:19:46,917 --> 00:19:49,667
Well, you're welcome for that.
But only for that.

328
00:19:49,750 --> 00:19:50,792
Have a nice life!

329
00:20:36,125 --> 00:20:37,125
Steve the Courier!

330
00:20:39,167 --> 00:20:40,167
What up?

331
00:20:41,458 --> 00:20:43,667
You did deliver my message this morning,
yes?

332
00:20:45,500 --> 00:20:46,625
Message.

333
00:20:47,333 --> 00:20:49,708
Uh, message.

334
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,250
Message.

335
00:20:53,333 --> 00:20:54,833
Oh, yeah, I... I think so.

336
00:20:54,917 --> 00:20:56,167
Y... You think so?

337
00:20:56,250 --> 00:20:57,250
I, um...

338
00:21:01,167 --> 00:21:02,292
Steve!

339
00:21:02,375 --> 00:21:05,000
I definitely delivered all the mail.

340
00:21:07,417 --> 00:21:09,375
And there was nothing for me in return?

341
00:21:09,458 --> 00:21:11,708
No, no.
Just some letters for your pops.

342
00:21:11,792 --> 00:21:12,917
That's it?

343
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,000
Yeah, that's it.

344
00:21:14,750 --> 00:21:16,042
You're... You're sure?

345
00:21:16,542 --> 00:21:17,625
Yeah, 100%.

346
00:21:20,792 --> 00:21:22,500
You think he's angry with me?

347
00:21:22,583 --> 00:21:24,042
I don't know why he would be.

348
00:21:24,125 --> 00:21:25,458
Do you think he's tired of me?

349
00:21:25,542 --> 00:21:26,958
I'm sure that's not it.

350
00:21:27,042 --> 00:21:28,375
Then why haven't I heard from him?

351
00:21:28,458 --> 00:21:31,292
Well,
there is a lot of plague going around.

352
00:21:31,375 --> 00:21:32,833
You think he has plague?

353
00:21:32,917 --> 00:21:35,625
He did look a bit boily.
But it's probably just hormones.

354
00:21:35,708 --> 00:21:37,208
- Oh, my God.
- Rosaline!

355
00:21:38,125 --> 00:21:40,750
Uh, your, um...

356
00:21:40,833 --> 00:21:41,833
Oh, she knows.

357
00:21:41,917 --> 00:21:45,250
Oh. Well, I saw Romeo crossing the bridge,
and he's headed this way.

358
00:22:34,792 --> 00:22:36,208
Where the hell is he going?

359
00:23:16,292 --> 00:23:17,500
Whatever.

360
00:23:18,333 --> 00:23:20,875
It's fine. It's fine.

361
00:23:22,250 --> 00:23:24,292
It's not like he can't have friends.

362
00:23:26,042 --> 00:23:29,458
Thou art as glorious
as a winged messenger of heaven.

363
00:23:29,542 --> 00:23:31,708
Except for whoever that is.

364
00:23:31,792 --> 00:23:35,417
The fairest stars in heaven
do entreat your eyes.

365
00:23:35,500 --> 00:23:37,042
The fairest stars.

366
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:44,167
Forswear it, sight.
I never saw true beauty until this night.

367
00:23:44,833 --> 00:23:46,042
Son of a...

368
00:23:46,125 --> 00:23:47,250
Madam.

369
00:23:48,500 --> 00:23:54,125
Nurse! Sweet Montague, be true.
Stay but a little, I will come again.

370
00:24:02,750 --> 00:24:05,542
O, blessed, blessed night!

371
00:24:41,708 --> 00:24:43,542
Not getting out of bed today either?

372
00:24:47,917 --> 00:24:48,917
Stay out.

373
00:24:50,208 --> 00:24:52,000
Hey, I was listening to that.

374
00:24:52,083 --> 00:24:53,125
It was horrible.

375
00:24:54,292 --> 00:24:56,208
How long is this gonna go on for?

376
00:24:56,292 --> 00:24:58,875
The sun is shining. The air is warm.

377
00:24:58,958 --> 00:25:00,792
A nice long ride will do you good.

378
00:25:00,875 --> 00:25:03,583
I'll call the stables
and have them saddle your horse.

379
00:25:03,667 --> 00:25:05,167
I can't ride the horse.

380
00:25:05,250 --> 00:25:06,375
Why not?

381
00:25:06,458 --> 00:25:07,458
I have cholera.

382
00:25:07,542 --> 00:25:09,167
You do not have cholera.

383
00:25:09,250 --> 00:25:10,333
How do you know?

384
00:25:10,417 --> 00:25:13,083
Because I am a registered nurse.

385
00:25:13,167 --> 00:25:15,833
What's the point?

386
00:25:15,917 --> 00:25:19,333
The point is you can't
lie around in bed all afternoon, chicken.

387
00:25:21,333 --> 00:25:23,750
I'll never love again.

388
00:25:23,833 --> 00:25:26,417
I think
you're being rather dramatic, Rosaline.

389
00:25:28,583 --> 00:25:31,583
Nurse, you don't understand.

390
00:25:32,167 --> 00:25:37,208
They were kissing, and-and-and touching,
and-and being all gross.

391
00:25:37,292 --> 00:25:41,375
And he was saying things to her
that he just said to me three days ago.

392
00:25:41,458 --> 00:25:42,333
Mmm.

393
00:25:42,417 --> 00:25:43,792
- Three days.
- Yes.

394
00:25:43,875 --> 00:25:45,417
- Three, Nurse.
- Yes.

395
00:25:45,917 --> 00:25:47,333
Yet, the worst part is,

396
00:25:47,417 --> 00:25:48,625
it's my fault.

397
00:25:48,708 --> 00:25:50,000
I drove him to her.

398
00:25:53,208 --> 00:25:55,792
If only I'd said "I love you"
when I had the chance.

399
00:26:00,333 --> 00:26:01,917
- This should be fun.
- Oh, please.

400
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:03,917
Ah, young Rosaline.

401
00:26:04,417 --> 00:26:07,917
Mmm. Uncle Capulet, what a surprise.

402
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:09,000
Rosaline.

403
00:26:09,083 --> 00:26:10,083
Aunt Lady, welcome.

404
00:26:10,167 --> 00:26:11,458
It's been too long.

405
00:26:12,083 --> 00:26:14,500
Oh, you remember your cousin, Tybalt.

406
00:26:16,375 --> 00:26:17,375
I do.

407
00:26:17,875 --> 00:26:19,958
And our daughter
just returned from school.

408
00:26:20,042 --> 00:26:22,750
Of course! Sweet little…

409
00:26:26,792 --> 00:26:27,792
Juliet.

410
00:26:29,917 --> 00:26:32,417
It's so good to see you, Rosaline.

411
00:26:32,500 --> 00:26:35,583
Ah. Ow.

412
00:26:35,667 --> 00:26:37,250
I think my earring's caught.

413
00:26:37,333 --> 00:26:39,958
Oh, just, uh, just a little to the left.

414
00:26:40,042 --> 00:26:42,542
Oh.

415
00:26:45,917 --> 00:26:50,000
Wow. Wow. You're...

416
00:26:50,083 --> 00:26:52,375
All grown up now. I know.

417
00:26:52,458 --> 00:26:53,500
Oh.

418
00:26:53,583 --> 00:26:56,792
The last time I saw you, you had gaps
in your teeth, and you came up to here.

419
00:26:56,875 --> 00:26:59,250
Ah, it really has been a long time.

420
00:27:00,083 --> 00:27:01,792
We have so much to catch up on.

421
00:27:01,875 --> 00:27:06,583
- It's so lovely seeing you.
- Definitely.

422
00:27:07,125 --> 00:27:09,458
Oh, my God.

423
00:27:14,542 --> 00:27:16,417
Surely you know why I'm here, Adrian?

424
00:27:16,500 --> 00:27:19,417
This is your quarrel,
brother, not mine.

425
00:27:19,500 --> 00:27:21,917
It is all our quarrel.
You're a Capulet.

426
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,167
I don't like
the Montagues any more than you do,

427
00:27:24,250 --> 00:27:25,500
but that's why there's laws.

428
00:27:25,583 --> 00:27:27,167
We've let this get out of hand.

429
00:27:27,250 --> 00:27:30,417
It is up to us
to make this city great again.

430
00:27:31,125 --> 00:27:33,083
Can I say something?

431
00:27:33,792 --> 00:27:37,625
If you really hate the Montagues so much,
you could just move.

432
00:27:39,125 --> 00:27:40,667
I hear Siena is very nice.

433
00:27:41,208 --> 00:27:44,083
You let your daughter speak
at the dinner table?

434
00:27:44,167 --> 00:27:47,750
I'm sorry.
I thought this was my house.

435
00:27:47,833 --> 00:27:48,833
Rosaline.

436
00:27:48,917 --> 00:27:51,333
What? I don't go to his house
and tell him how to do things.

437
00:27:51,417 --> 00:27:54,667
Rosaline,
take your cousin out to the garden.

438
00:27:54,750 --> 00:27:56,500
I'm sure you have much to catch up on.

439
00:27:56,583 --> 00:27:58,958
- But Dad, the swan.
- The garden. Rosaline!

440
00:27:59,458 --> 00:28:01,458
- Juliet.
- Now.

441
00:28:08,833 --> 00:28:11,083
Well, that was awkward.

442
00:28:21,250 --> 00:28:23,333
Do you always talk to your dad like that?

443
00:28:24,417 --> 00:28:25,417
Whatever.

444
00:28:26,042 --> 00:28:29,750
God, I can't wait to be old like you.

445
00:28:33,417 --> 00:28:35,708
You know, what's your rush?

446
00:28:36,375 --> 00:28:38,417
You won't be young forever, you know?

447
00:28:38,500 --> 00:28:40,583
And what about another year of,
uh, finishing school?

448
00:28:41,417 --> 00:28:42,625
That could be fun.

449
00:28:43,750 --> 00:28:46,375
Oh. I'm pretty finished.

450
00:28:50,708 --> 00:28:51,708
Rosaline.

451
00:28:53,292 --> 00:28:54,750
Can I tell you a secret?

452
00:28:56,958 --> 00:28:58,292
But you can't tell anyone.

453
00:28:59,958 --> 00:29:00,958
I'm listening.

454
00:29:02,083 --> 00:29:03,083
I'm in love.

455
00:29:06,042 --> 00:29:07,542
I met a boy.

456
00:29:09,292 --> 00:29:13,875
And he is just the most wonderful boy
in the whole world.

457
00:29:14,375 --> 00:29:16,125
I see. Um...

458
00:29:16,208 --> 00:29:19,375
Where was it that you met this wonder boy?

459
00:29:19,458 --> 00:29:22,125
Oh, the other night
at the masquerade ball.

460
00:29:22,208 --> 00:29:25,417
And already,
I can't imagine my life without him.

461
00:29:25,500 --> 00:29:26,500
It's time to go.

462
00:29:26,583 --> 00:29:28,083
- He says things to me.
- Excuse me.

463
00:29:28,167 --> 00:29:32,250
Beautiful, romantic things.
You've never heard such poetry.

464
00:29:35,708 --> 00:29:36,792
Let me guess.

465
00:29:39,167 --> 00:29:42,083
He compares you to the moon and the sun.

466
00:29:44,125 --> 00:29:47,250
"The fairest stars in heaven
do entreat your eyes."

467
00:29:51,458 --> 00:29:54,792
- How... How do you...
- It's Romeo Montague, isn't it?

468
00:30:03,333 --> 00:30:04,333
Yeah.

469
00:30:05,208 --> 00:30:08,125
Everybody knows Romeo Montague.

470
00:30:11,208 --> 00:30:14,542
I'm afraid you're not the first
young maiden he's charmed with his…

471
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:19,625
High cheekbones and fancy words.

472
00:30:21,375 --> 00:30:23,208
I'm such a fool.

473
00:30:24,542 --> 00:30:26,708
Yeah, you kind of are.

474
00:30:27,875 --> 00:30:31,250
But don't beat yourself up about it.

475
00:30:31,333 --> 00:30:33,750
You know,
it could have happened to anybody.

476
00:30:34,750 --> 00:30:35,750
Did it happen to you?

477
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:38,542
To me? No, please.

478
00:30:40,417 --> 00:30:44,958
Juliet, you're not even of marrying age.

479
00:30:45,042 --> 00:30:49,708
Why settle down with just one man
when you can, you know, live a little,

480
00:30:49,792 --> 00:30:53,167
play the field,
sample at the buffet of life?

481
00:30:54,958 --> 00:30:56,167
How do I do that?

482
00:30:59,042 --> 00:31:03,042
Well, I could show you, if you want.

483
00:31:05,250 --> 00:31:07,042
You would do that for me?

484
00:31:08,625 --> 00:31:10,042
What are cousins for?

485
00:31:21,375 --> 00:31:23,958
Now, who wants to buy us some drinks?

486
00:31:24,042 --> 00:31:27,292
- Me!
- Right here! Right here!

487
00:31:27,375 --> 00:31:33,958
No. That is just so funny,
because I love sports.

488
00:31:34,042 --> 00:31:37,625
- Oh, really?
- Yeah, jousting, fencing, grappling.

489
00:31:37,708 --> 00:31:40,708
Oh, my God! I am a jouster!

490
00:31:40,792 --> 00:31:42,917
What? No way!

491
00:31:44,167 --> 00:31:45,833
Please, let me buy you another drink.

492
00:31:45,917 --> 00:31:47,542
Oh, um. We'll be right back.

493
00:31:51,375 --> 00:31:53,875
Okay. Now you try.

494
00:31:53,958 --> 00:31:56,792
Um, I don't know.

495
00:31:56,875 --> 00:31:59,125
- These men are so…
- Easy?

496
00:31:59,208 --> 00:32:00,208
Stupid!

497
00:32:00,875 --> 00:32:02,208
Why on Earth would I want to spend

498
00:32:02,292 --> 00:32:04,208
the rest of my life
with someone like that?

499
00:32:04,292 --> 00:32:05,292
Ew.

500
00:32:05,375 --> 00:32:09,458
Juliet, you're not here to find someone
to spend your life with.

501
00:32:09,542 --> 00:32:13,583
You're here to just enjoy yourself
at their expense,

502
00:32:13,667 --> 00:32:16,708
and then never see them ever again. Okay?

503
00:32:16,792 --> 00:32:19,125
- Now, get out there and have some fun.
- Oh.

504
00:32:20,750 --> 00:32:21,750
Go on.

505
00:32:22,583 --> 00:32:25,250
Go. Go.

506
00:32:26,875 --> 00:32:27,875
Um.

507
00:32:28,625 --> 00:32:33,667
Uh, your... your mustache is so thick.

508
00:32:33,750 --> 00:32:35,875
Oh, thank you.

509
00:32:38,167 --> 00:32:39,417
Do you wanna have a seat?

510
00:32:39,500 --> 00:32:40,667
May I?

511
00:32:43,125 --> 00:32:46,042
Excuse me? Hello?

512
00:32:46,625 --> 00:32:48,333
Hello? Over here!

513
00:32:48,417 --> 00:32:50,250
Hi. If... If you could just...

514
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:56,958
- How are you, Rosaline?
- Admiral Shit-for-Brains.

515
00:32:57,417 --> 00:32:58,750
Hello?

516
00:33:01,542 --> 00:33:03,375
I'd like to order a drink, sir.

517
00:33:08,833 --> 00:33:10,042
Thanks.

518
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:20,458
You know, when I first came to Verona,

519
00:33:21,583 --> 00:33:25,375
I thought the place would be filled with
women looking for a respectable husband.

520
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:28,667
Turns out, not so much.

521
00:33:28,750 --> 00:33:31,333
Are you the respectable
husband in that scenario?

522
00:33:33,875 --> 00:33:35,875
How is it going with
that boyfriend of yours?

523
00:33:35,958 --> 00:33:38,583
Good. Great, actually.

524
00:33:38,667 --> 00:33:40,833
And is he here? I'd love to meet him.

525
00:33:40,917 --> 00:33:44,083
No, he's... He's actually busy tonight.

526
00:33:44,167 --> 00:33:45,042
Really?

527
00:33:45,125 --> 00:33:46,667
Dive bars aren't really his scene anyway.

528
00:33:46,750 --> 00:33:48,458
Ah. Shame.

529
00:33:49,375 --> 00:33:51,417
Well, I imagine he's very respectable.

530
00:33:51,500 --> 00:33:52,375
Yeah.

531
00:33:52,458 --> 00:33:57,167
He's witty and smart, writes sonnets,

532
00:33:57,250 --> 00:33:59,333
speaks several different
foreign languages.

533
00:33:59,417 --> 00:34:02,917
You know, just really the opposite of you.

534
00:34:04,292 --> 00:34:05,292
Is that so?

535
00:34:10,792 --> 00:34:12,500
Well, I will leave you to it then.

536
00:34:13,958 --> 00:34:14,958
You'll be missed.

537
00:34:35,417 --> 00:34:38,458
All right. If you'll excuse me, I must go.

538
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:41,708
Hey, lady. Please,
you must let me see you some time.

539
00:34:41,792 --> 00:34:44,042
Back off, fella.
She was talking to me.

540
00:34:44,125 --> 00:34:46,375
Okay, bye.

541
00:34:48,208 --> 00:34:49,833
- Hey.
- Hi.

542
00:34:49,917 --> 00:34:54,417
Rosaline, I'm having so much fun.
Thank you.

543
00:34:54,500 --> 00:34:56,667
Oh! Oh!

544
00:34:57,542 --> 00:34:59,583
- Ow! Oh! Ow!
- Oh.

545
00:35:00,083 --> 00:35:02,583
- Not again. It's caught.
- Sorry.

546
00:35:03,958 --> 00:35:07,458
Every time.

547
00:35:08,625 --> 00:35:09,958
Hmm.

548
00:35:10,042 --> 00:35:12,417
Mmm. Mmm.

549
00:35:12,500 --> 00:35:14,583
And the best part is
you were totally right.

550
00:35:14,667 --> 00:35:17,042
I haven't thought about Romeo once.

551
00:35:17,125 --> 00:35:20,542
Well, in that case,
shall we do it again tomorrow?

552
00:35:22,625 --> 00:35:23,667
Yes.

553
00:35:25,708 --> 00:35:28,333
My dearest Romeo.
I haven't heard from you in a while.

554
00:35:28,417 --> 00:35:29,500
I hope you're okay.

555
00:35:29,583 --> 00:35:30,708
- What is your name?
- Oh, it's Juliet.

556
00:35:30,792 --> 00:35:32,083
Nothing much new over here,

557
00:35:32,167 --> 00:35:34,917
except I'm being forced to babysit
my younger cousin,

558
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:36,708
and she's really a handful.

559
00:35:36,792 --> 00:35:39,500
I've somehow fallen
into the role of big sister.

560
00:35:39,583 --> 00:35:40,667
Check.

561
00:35:40,750 --> 00:35:43,500
You know, older, wiser, more beautiful.

562
00:35:43,583 --> 00:35:44,583
Checkmate.

563
00:35:46,125 --> 00:35:47,875
At the very least, more worldly.

564
00:35:52,250 --> 00:35:55,333
They definitely didn't teach that
in finishing school.

565
00:35:56,333 --> 00:35:59,250
Wait till you get to page 74.

566
00:36:04,375 --> 00:36:05,583
Be sure that he gets this.

567
00:36:05,667 --> 00:36:06,667
But enough about her.

568
00:36:06,750 --> 00:36:11,083
I miss you and your warm embrace,
sweet Romeo.

569
00:36:11,167 --> 00:36:13,208
Yours, Rosaline.

570
00:36:14,583 --> 00:36:15,958
Dearest Romeo.

571
00:36:16,042 --> 00:36:19,625
You must be really busy,
because I still haven't heard from you.

572
00:36:21,375 --> 00:36:24,333
I'm enclosing a map I made
of the A pen nine mountains.

573
00:36:24,417 --> 00:36:28,708
I marked a trail to the perfect spot
for our remote mountaintop cabin.

574
00:36:28,792 --> 00:36:30,167
Write me back.

575
00:36:30,250 --> 00:36:32,833
I'm so lost without you.

576
00:36:32,917 --> 00:36:34,208
Rosaline.

577
00:36:34,708 --> 00:36:36,208
Where is that?

578
00:36:37,958 --> 00:36:40,208
It's the island of Cyprus
and Famagusta Bay.

579
00:36:42,083 --> 00:36:43,708
That's really beautiful.

580
00:36:45,917 --> 00:36:47,792
I'm sure you hear that all the time,
though.

581
00:36:49,667 --> 00:36:53,292
Uh, no, actually. I don't.

582
00:36:54,500 --> 00:36:55,500
Well, it's true.

583
00:37:00,917 --> 00:37:03,792
Romeo, are you alive?

584
00:37:03,875 --> 00:37:05,542
Have you run out of quill ink?

585
00:37:06,250 --> 00:37:07,792
Why do you not return my letters?

586
00:37:08,458 --> 00:37:09,458
Steve!

587
00:37:17,542 --> 00:37:22,917
The knight goes here,
and the pawn moves up one space.

588
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:24,500
And that is a Ponziani opening.

589
00:37:25,542 --> 00:37:29,042
You're awesome.

590
00:37:30,708 --> 00:37:32,292
Whoa! Whoa!

591
00:37:32,833 --> 00:37:34,833
- Whoa.
- Whoa, whoa!

592
00:37:34,917 --> 00:37:36,792
Oh, it's okay. It's okay.

593
00:37:40,667 --> 00:37:42,750
You're fine. You're fine.

594
00:37:43,917 --> 00:37:46,750
You're so handsome. Yes.

595
00:37:46,833 --> 00:37:48,042
You are so good.

596
00:37:48,708 --> 00:37:50,375
He's just a little spooked.

597
00:38:13,375 --> 00:38:14,583
Rosaline.

598
00:38:14,667 --> 00:38:15,667
- Hey.
- Hi.

599
00:38:15,750 --> 00:38:18,292
Um, okay.

600
00:38:19,750 --> 00:38:23,583
I… …have to tell you something.

601
00:38:23,667 --> 00:38:24,875
Okay.

602
00:38:28,625 --> 00:38:31,125
Look, this...

603
00:38:31,208 --> 00:38:36,750
This really isn't easy to admit,
but I, um...

604
00:38:40,167 --> 00:38:41,083
What are those?

605
00:38:44,917 --> 00:38:45,917
Um…

606
00:38:48,750 --> 00:38:50,167
He keeps writing me letters.

607
00:38:50,833 --> 00:38:52,333
He's been writing you letters?

608
00:38:59,833 --> 00:39:03,542
Uh, I mean,
I-I-I just thought you were done with him.

609
00:39:03,625 --> 00:39:06,458
I am. I was. No.

610
00:39:06,542 --> 00:39:10,000
No, I am. Um, but...
Uh, well, it's just, I feel...

611
00:39:10,083 --> 00:39:11,083
Juliet!

612
00:39:12,750 --> 00:39:14,125
Juliet!

613
00:39:17,292 --> 00:39:18,292
Um.

614
00:39:22,083 --> 00:39:23,083
Juliet!

615
00:39:23,583 --> 00:39:24,750
He keeps showing up.

616
00:39:24,833 --> 00:39:28,000
I won't go away until you talk to me,
sweet Juliet.

617
00:39:28,667 --> 00:39:31,583
Please, Rosaline. You gotta help me.

618
00:39:33,625 --> 00:39:34,792
Help you do what?

619
00:39:40,042 --> 00:39:42,875
Stand back, Romeo. Don't come any closer.

620
00:39:45,125 --> 00:39:47,417
Doth mine eyes deceive me?

621
00:39:47,500 --> 00:39:51,000
All the heavens shine in your direction.

622
00:39:51,083 --> 00:39:52,167
Stop him talking.

623
00:39:52,250 --> 00:39:53,625
- To gaze upon you...
- Stop talking.

624
00:39:53,708 --> 00:39:56,542
I will not, Juliet.

625
00:39:56,625 --> 00:39:58,375
I will not and cannot,

626
00:39:58,458 --> 00:40:01,542
lest you tell me
what I have done to displease you.

627
00:40:01,625 --> 00:40:03,667
Fine. I'll tell you.

628
00:40:03,750 --> 00:40:05,333
- You're a phony.
- You're a pony.

629
00:40:05,417 --> 00:40:07,958
- A what?
- Phony. He's a phony.

630
00:40:08,042 --> 00:40:09,708
Uh, a phony, I said.

631
00:40:09,792 --> 00:40:11,583
You're a liar and a scoundrel.

632
00:40:11,667 --> 00:40:13,667
Juliet,
you know I'm none of those things.

633
00:40:13,750 --> 00:40:15,750
So I was the first you compared
to the moon and the stars?

634
00:40:15,833 --> 00:40:18,958
Was I the first you compared
to the moon and the stars?

635
00:40:19,792 --> 00:40:21,542
All right.

636
00:40:23,375 --> 00:40:26,667
Well, I will be honest with you.

637
00:40:26,750 --> 00:40:29,958
I... I have said those words to another.

638
00:40:31,208 --> 00:40:33,375
But I never meant them until I met you.

639
00:40:33,875 --> 00:40:35,542
Oh, please!

640
00:40:37,500 --> 00:40:39,000
Is someone there with you?

641
00:40:39,542 --> 00:40:40,542
No.

642
00:40:41,250 --> 00:40:44,000
Juliet, we belong together.

643
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:46,792
You need to go, Romeo.

644
00:40:48,750 --> 00:40:49,958
That truly what you want?

645
00:40:53,125 --> 00:40:54,208
You need to go, Romeo.

646
00:40:59,792 --> 00:41:00,792
Then I will go.

647
00:41:05,292 --> 00:41:06,292
Gone for good.

648
00:41:44,250 --> 00:41:45,250
You did well.

649
00:41:47,542 --> 00:41:49,667
So, why do I feel so terrible?

650
00:41:54,333 --> 00:41:55,667
Thank you, Cousin.

651
00:41:57,333 --> 00:41:59,208
I'd be lost without you.

652
00:42:02,083 --> 00:42:05,083
Wait. Wasn't there something
you wanted to tell me?

653
00:42:06,208 --> 00:42:08,375
Oh. No, it's not important.

654
00:42:10,208 --> 00:42:11,333
Ow! Oh!

655
00:42:12,167 --> 00:42:13,583
- Why does this keep happening?
- Sorry.

656
00:42:13,667 --> 00:42:15,917
- Okay. Well, you just need to...
- If I just...

657
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:18,792
- No. Just... Mmm.
- Oh!

658
00:42:22,833 --> 00:42:27,458
"Romeo and… Rosaline"?

659
00:42:35,625 --> 00:42:36,750
Juliet.

660
00:42:36,833 --> 00:42:37,708
Don't speak.

661
00:42:42,333 --> 00:42:44,500
Juliet. It... It's not what it...

662
00:42:44,583 --> 00:42:45,875
I listened to you.

663
00:42:47,333 --> 00:42:49,458
I trusted you,

664
00:42:49,542 --> 00:42:51,208
and all you did was lie.

665
00:42:51,292 --> 00:42:53,083
Juliet, I didn't lie.

666
00:42:53,167 --> 00:42:56,417
I just told you most of the truth

667
00:42:56,500 --> 00:43:00,542
instead of, well, you know, all of it.

668
00:43:01,625 --> 00:43:03,250
I thought you were my friend.

669
00:43:03,333 --> 00:43:05,583
I am your friend. I am.

670
00:43:05,667 --> 00:43:10,625
All this time, turns out you just wanted
to steal my boyfriend away.

671
00:43:10,708 --> 00:43:13,542
I was not trying
to steal your boyfriend away.

672
00:43:13,625 --> 00:43:15,125
I was just trying to steal him back.

673
00:43:15,792 --> 00:43:17,542
- Oh.
- There's a difference.

674
00:43:22,125 --> 00:43:23,167
I see how it is.

675
00:43:26,167 --> 00:43:27,167
Sure.

676
00:43:28,417 --> 00:43:32,125
I mean, it all makes perfect sense,
actually.

677
00:43:32,750 --> 00:43:33,875
I'm younger than you.

678
00:43:34,917 --> 00:43:37,000
I'm… richer than you.

679
00:43:38,250 --> 00:43:39,625
I'm not afraid of fish.

680
00:43:40,708 --> 00:43:43,417
I don't have huge man feet.

681
00:43:45,250 --> 00:43:47,500
You needed me
out of the picture.

682
00:43:47,583 --> 00:43:49,000
Of course you did.

683
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:55,083
After all, what chance does someone like
you have when someone like me is around?

684
00:43:58,167 --> 00:44:03,250
Well, Cousin,
it appears your little gambit has failed.

685
00:44:06,750 --> 00:44:08,125
- Fine.
- Good.

686
00:44:08,208 --> 00:44:09,250
Great.

687
00:44:10,208 --> 00:44:13,083
Let me know next time
he shows up on your balcony.

688
00:44:13,167 --> 00:44:15,500
Let me know
when your wisdom teeth come in.

689
00:44:16,625 --> 00:44:18,125
- What?
- You heard me!

690
00:44:18,208 --> 00:44:19,583
The point is, he's not coming.

691
00:44:19,667 --> 00:44:21,292
Guess we'll see about that, won't we?

692
00:44:22,750 --> 00:44:24,625
She's right. He's not coming.

693
00:44:24,708 --> 00:44:28,250
- Mmm. Oh.
- What's the use? It's hopeless.

694
00:44:28,333 --> 00:44:29,625
Rosaline, what is this?

695
00:44:30,625 --> 00:44:32,500
You need to focus and pull it together.

696
00:44:33,875 --> 00:44:34,875
Come here.

697
00:44:36,167 --> 00:44:38,667
I don't have a ton of time
for your drama right now, okay?

698
00:44:39,833 --> 00:44:44,250
Your father is not the only lord in town
who has a child he disapproves of.

699
00:44:44,333 --> 00:44:45,417
Mm-hmm.

700
00:44:45,500 --> 00:44:46,500
I'm sorry.

701
00:44:46,583 --> 00:44:48,875
If only I could just get him off the scent

702
00:44:48,958 --> 00:44:50,625
just for a little while.

703
00:44:51,708 --> 00:44:56,208
Oh, this is cute. Mmm.

704
00:44:58,042 --> 00:45:00,167
That's it! You marry her.

705
00:45:00,833 --> 00:45:02,625
- Who?
- Juliet.

706
00:45:02,708 --> 00:45:05,458
What? Have we met before? I'm... I'm Paris.

707
00:45:08,667 --> 00:45:11,875
You need a decoy. She needs an obstacle.

708
00:45:11,958 --> 00:45:14,542
I need her out of the picture.

709
00:45:15,625 --> 00:45:16,667
It's perfect.

710
00:45:17,250 --> 00:45:21,292
Mm-hmm. Yeah, it's not perfect for me.
I don't wanna marry a woman.

711
00:45:21,375 --> 00:45:24,500
Yeah, I know, but that's the best part.

712
00:45:25,083 --> 00:45:29,125
You won't have to marry her for another,
like, two or three years.

713
00:45:29,208 --> 00:45:32,708
And by that time,
you could be far away from here.

714
00:45:33,458 --> 00:45:34,833
You could be wherever you want.

715
00:45:36,875 --> 00:45:37,875
Mmm.

716
00:45:38,417 --> 00:45:43,000
And do you promise
to care for her and protect her?

717
00:45:43,083 --> 00:45:44,083
Mm-hmm.

718
00:45:44,792 --> 00:45:49,917
And do you promise to guide her morally
and keep her on a righteous path?

719
00:45:50,625 --> 00:45:51,833
Oh, for sure.

720
00:45:51,917 --> 00:45:54,375
And, when the time is right,

721
00:45:54,458 --> 00:46:00,708
to bring a whole host of
strapping young men into your household?

722
00:46:00,792 --> 00:46:01,792
Wait. What?

723
00:46:02,417 --> 00:46:03,417
Sons, Paris.

724
00:46:03,500 --> 00:46:05,167
Ya...

725
00:46:05,250 --> 00:46:08,625
Yes, absolutely. Sons. Mm-hmm.

726
00:46:08,708 --> 00:46:13,083
Then it fills me with the greatest of joy
to accept your request.

727
00:46:13,167 --> 00:46:18,000
In two years' time,
when the girl is of marrying age,

728
00:46:18,083 --> 00:46:23,417
we will have the most glorious celebration
to unite our families.

729
00:46:23,500 --> 00:46:27,250
Two years, three years,
I mean, there's... there's really no rush.

730
00:46:27,333 --> 00:46:29,417
And tonight, we'll feast.

731
00:46:29,500 --> 00:46:32,583
Go. Tell all of West Verona,

732
00:46:32,667 --> 00:46:37,708
and I will go tell the lucky girl
the good news.

733
00:46:37,792 --> 00:46:40,875
She'll be so excited!

734
00:46:42,542 --> 00:46:44,458
You can't do this to me!

735
00:46:44,542 --> 00:46:46,583
Of course I can! I'm your father!

736
00:46:46,667 --> 00:46:47,708
- No!
- Juliet,

737
00:46:47,792 --> 00:46:53,292
every respectable family in Verona is
downstairs, celebrating your engagement,

738
00:46:53,375 --> 00:46:55,542
while you're up here embarrassing me!

739
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:01,583
You know I'm not just
your daughter, right?

740
00:47:01,667 --> 00:47:05,542
I have opinions, ideas,
passions of my own!

741
00:47:06,042 --> 00:47:07,833
How dare you speak to us like that!

742
00:47:08,500 --> 00:47:10,542
You have ruined my life!

743
00:47:10,625 --> 00:47:12,083
Juliet!

744
00:47:13,792 --> 00:47:15,500
I thought you'd be pleased.

745
00:47:15,583 --> 00:47:20,292
Okay, he's Rosaline's friend.
Pretty big deal, he's a count.

746
00:47:21,333 --> 00:47:22,625
Rosaline's friend?

747
00:47:22,708 --> 00:47:25,250
Whole great life for your future. Please.

748
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:29,250
Oh!

749
00:47:30,875 --> 00:47:33,292
I'm so sorry, dear.
I don't know what's gotten into her.

750
00:47:33,958 --> 00:47:36,125
Oh, I know exactly what's gotten into her.

751
00:47:37,583 --> 00:47:40,667
Rosaline, this is all your fault.

752
00:47:40,750 --> 00:47:43,792
Whatever wild ideas you've been
filling my daughter's head with...

753
00:47:43,875 --> 00:47:46,208
- Hello.
- Good to see you.

754
00:47:46,292 --> 00:47:48,542
I need you to unfill it at once.

755
00:47:49,125 --> 00:47:50,250
-Go up to her room,
-Mm-hmm.

756
00:47:50,333 --> 00:47:52,333
- Get her down to her party, please.
- Mm-hmm.

757
00:47:52,417 --> 00:47:54,417
- Please.
- Yes. Certainly, Uncle.

758
00:47:55,792 --> 00:47:56,792
Go.

759
00:47:58,458 --> 00:47:59,667
Paris.

760
00:48:03,208 --> 00:48:04,500
The hell was he wearing?

761
00:48:17,542 --> 00:48:18,875
Juliet.

762
00:48:29,083 --> 00:48:30,083
Hello?

763
00:48:57,542 --> 00:48:59,333
"Hie you hence to the friar's cell,

764
00:48:59,417 --> 00:49:01,875
where tonight a true husband
shall make you a wife."

765
00:49:04,125 --> 00:49:05,125
Shit.

766
00:49:05,208 --> 00:49:07,375
Excuse me.
Excuse me. I'm in a rush.

767
00:49:07,458 --> 00:49:08,458
Oh!

768
00:49:10,042 --> 00:49:12,708
Please move.
I've got to stop a wedding right now.

769
00:49:12,792 --> 00:49:14,083
There she is.

770
00:49:14,167 --> 00:49:15,958
Look, it's Dario.

771
00:49:16,042 --> 00:49:20,417
- I really don't have time for this. What?
- Rosaline, do not be rude, please.

772
00:49:24,500 --> 00:49:26,583
- Mwah. Mwah.
- There we go.

773
00:49:27,083 --> 00:49:28,417
Okay. Good night.

774
00:49:31,083 --> 00:49:32,500
She's coming around.

775
00:49:40,208 --> 00:49:41,208
Hey!

776
00:49:45,625 --> 00:49:46,625
Where are you going?

777
00:49:48,792 --> 00:49:49,917
What do you care?

778
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:51,125
I don't.

779
00:49:52,458 --> 00:49:53,917
Then what is it that you want?

780
00:49:56,250 --> 00:49:58,167
I want my knife back, please.

781
00:50:02,167 --> 00:50:03,167
Worth a shot.

782
00:50:08,500 --> 00:50:10,375
You aren't actually thinking
of going out there, are you?

783
00:50:10,458 --> 00:50:11,458
Yeah.

784
00:50:13,625 --> 00:50:15,042
Sure looks pretty dark.

785
00:50:15,833 --> 00:50:16,833
I can manage.

786
00:50:19,083 --> 00:50:22,083
Look, I can...
I can walk with you if you'd like.

787
00:50:23,833 --> 00:50:25,958
I don't need an escort.

788
00:50:26,042 --> 00:50:29,167
Will just be taking this. See? This torch.

789
00:50:29,250 --> 00:50:31,833
To go in by myself.

790
00:50:31,917 --> 00:50:32,917
Mm-hmm.

791
00:50:39,333 --> 00:50:40,625
Christ! What was that?

792
00:50:41,125 --> 00:50:42,292
Oh, it's probably nothing.

793
00:50:42,958 --> 00:50:46,208
- Okay.
- Yeah, or a bear.

794
00:50:47,958 --> 00:50:49,125
Hmm.

795
00:50:50,458 --> 00:50:54,625
Okay, well, maybe just to
the, uh, bridge after the forest.

796
00:50:54,708 --> 00:50:56,708
What?
I'm sorry. What was that?

797
00:50:56,792 --> 00:51:00,958
Could you please
escort me through the forest?

798
00:51:02,208 --> 00:51:03,458
I would love to.

799
00:51:03,542 --> 00:51:05,167
Right.

800
00:51:05,250 --> 00:51:08,250
Just great.

801
00:51:16,583 --> 00:51:18,667
I'm sorry.
I can't tell you where we're going.

802
00:51:19,208 --> 00:51:20,208
Oh, you're fine.

803
00:51:21,500 --> 00:51:23,708
What I can say is it's urgent.

804
00:51:24,625 --> 00:51:25,917
Extremely urgent.

805
00:51:26,958 --> 00:51:27,958
Okay.

806
00:51:29,333 --> 00:51:30,792
You're not even a little curious?

807
00:51:30,875 --> 00:51:32,708
I don't get involved.

808
00:51:35,458 --> 00:51:36,500
It's this way.

809
00:51:38,875 --> 00:51:42,250
Well, if you must know,
I'm going to stop a wedding.

810
00:51:43,583 --> 00:51:47,667
My boyfriend is about to make
the biggest mistake of his life.

811
00:51:48,583 --> 00:51:49,958
Uh, hang on a second. Wait.

812
00:51:52,167 --> 00:51:54,375
It's your boyfriend's wedding?

813
00:51:55,583 --> 00:51:56,500
Yeah.

814
00:51:57,833 --> 00:51:59,000
Ouch.

815
00:52:00,208 --> 00:52:03,708
Yeah. They just met.
They barely know each other.

816
00:52:03,792 --> 00:52:07,083
They have literally nothing in common.
He can't possibly love her.

817
00:52:07,167 --> 00:52:08,792
How do you know that?

818
00:52:08,875 --> 00:52:09,958
Were you listening just now?

819
00:52:10,042 --> 00:52:12,375
They just met.
They barely know each other.

820
00:52:12,458 --> 00:52:13,750
- So what?
- No, like...

821
00:52:13,833 --> 00:52:16,167
That's not how love works.
It isn't rational.

822
00:52:18,500 --> 00:52:19,917
I knew you wouldn't understand.

823
00:52:21,375 --> 00:52:23,500
So what's your plan when we get there?

824
00:52:25,125 --> 00:52:27,917
We have to have a conversation.

825
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:30,250
He needs to know how I feel.

826
00:52:30,333 --> 00:52:32,917
Well, his wedding day seems
like the perfect time for that.

827
00:52:33,792 --> 00:52:36,833
We haven't had the chance
to talk about any of this,

828
00:52:36,917 --> 00:52:41,875
and I wanna show him
what life was like before he...

829
00:52:41,958 --> 00:52:42,958
Cheated on you.

830
00:52:44,500 --> 00:52:46,125
He did not cheat on me.

831
00:52:47,042 --> 00:52:48,167
Didn't he?

832
00:52:48,792 --> 00:52:50,125
I'm done talking to you now.

833
00:52:52,708 --> 00:52:54,458
So is this a back way in or?

834
00:52:54,542 --> 00:52:56,917
Well, I'm not exactly
welcome in these parts.

835
00:52:57,000 --> 00:52:59,042
Oh. 'Cause you're the ex?

836
00:52:59,542 --> 00:53:00,958
No, 'cause I'm a Capulet.

837
00:53:03,125 --> 00:53:04,542
Wait. This is Montague land?

838
00:53:05,792 --> 00:53:08,375
- Yep.
- You never told me your ex was a Montague.

839
00:53:08,458 --> 00:53:09,500
Did I never mention that?

840
00:53:09,583 --> 00:53:10,458
- No.
- Hmm.

841
00:53:10,542 --> 00:53:12,208
If they find us, Rosaline,
they will kill us.

842
00:53:12,292 --> 00:53:16,167
- Well, you can go at any time.
- Look, this is no joke. It isn't safe.

843
00:53:16,250 --> 00:53:19,792
Relax. Romeo once told me that the guards
are off duty at this time of night.

844
00:53:19,875 --> 00:53:21,750
- The coast should be totally...
- Halt!

845
00:53:21,833 --> 00:53:23,042
Who goes there?

846
00:53:24,583 --> 00:53:25,958
Halt!

847
00:53:26,042 --> 00:53:27,417
Stop! Stop!

848
00:53:29,167 --> 00:53:30,375
They're over here!

849
00:53:30,458 --> 00:53:31,708
Halt! Stop!

850
00:53:32,333 --> 00:53:33,583
Run!

851
00:53:33,667 --> 00:53:34,500
Hurry up! Halt!

852
00:53:34,583 --> 00:53:35,625
Which way did we come in?

853
00:53:35,708 --> 00:53:36,708
- Uh, that way, I think!
- Stop!

854
00:53:36,792 --> 00:53:38,917
- You think?
- I wasn't in the military!

855
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:39,958
Halt!

856
00:53:42,917 --> 00:53:45,750
- Hey! They went this way! Come on!
- Spread out!

857
00:53:45,833 --> 00:53:47,667
Come on!

858
00:53:47,750 --> 00:53:49,125
Come on!

859
00:53:53,083 --> 00:53:55,042
Do you have a match?

860
00:53:59,417 --> 00:54:00,625
Are you sure this is safe?

861
00:54:03,667 --> 00:54:04,667
Trust me.

862
00:54:12,750 --> 00:54:14,583
You were saying?

863
00:54:19,292 --> 00:54:20,625
What was that?

864
00:54:20,708 --> 00:54:22,208
- What? What?
- Wake up!

865
00:54:22,292 --> 00:54:24,250
- Take my knife.
- I already have it.

866
00:54:25,917 --> 00:54:26,917
Ho!

867
00:54:49,167 --> 00:54:50,292
Dario, look out!

868
00:54:57,083 --> 00:54:58,417
Lucky throw.

869
00:54:59,208 --> 00:55:00,208
Lucky knife.

870
00:55:07,083 --> 00:55:08,917
Let's go. Go. Go. Go.

871
00:55:09,417 --> 00:55:12,292
Come on! Hurry up!

872
00:55:12,375 --> 00:55:13,917
Through here.

873
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:16,500
You take the north barracks,
we'll cover the south!

874
00:55:17,500 --> 00:55:19,542
I see them right there!
Right down that way!

875
00:55:19,625 --> 00:55:20,750
Move, move, move!

876
00:55:22,125 --> 00:55:23,250
This way!

877
00:55:25,292 --> 00:55:27,375
- Go, go, go, go!
- Hey!

878
00:56:26,292 --> 00:56:27,750
Hey, let me ask you something.

879
00:56:29,500 --> 00:56:31,333
What is it you like about this Montague?

880
00:56:33,500 --> 00:56:36,208
Uh, lots of stuff.

881
00:56:37,333 --> 00:56:38,750
In particular.

882
00:56:40,083 --> 00:56:42,583
Well, we're in love.

883
00:56:44,042 --> 00:56:45,458
Then what do you love about him?

884
00:56:47,167 --> 00:56:48,542
It's just...

885
00:56:48,625 --> 00:56:51,667
It's not something
that you can put into words, so…

886
00:56:54,500 --> 00:56:56,583
Love is patient.

887
00:56:57,208 --> 00:56:58,542
Love is kind.

888
00:56:58,625 --> 00:57:00,458
Love is an open door.

889
00:57:00,542 --> 00:57:01,750
Love is all you need.

890
00:57:04,083 --> 00:57:08,208
I mean, love is like knowing how to fly
or how to breathe.

891
00:57:09,792 --> 00:57:13,792
When you're apart from her,
you can feel it in your stomach.

892
00:57:14,750 --> 00:57:15,875
You can taste it.

893
00:57:16,917 --> 00:57:19,208
And when you're together, it's like…

894
00:57:21,167 --> 00:57:23,208
It's impossible to believe
for one single minute

895
00:57:23,292 --> 00:57:25,250
that anyone anywhere
has ever had so much fun

896
00:57:25,333 --> 00:57:26,542
in the whole entire world.

897
00:57:29,542 --> 00:57:30,958
That's what love is like,

898
00:57:32,042 --> 00:57:33,583
put into words.

899
00:57:34,292 --> 00:57:36,000
It's not that hard.

900
00:58:02,958 --> 00:58:04,250
I'm…

901
00:58:05,917 --> 00:58:08,292
I'm sorry I got you into all this mess.

902
00:58:09,917 --> 00:58:10,917
Wasn't all bad.

903
00:58:12,292 --> 00:58:13,583
And…

904
00:58:14,375 --> 00:58:18,208
I'm sorry that I might have…

905
00:58:19,667 --> 00:58:23,333
Maybe misjudged you a little.

906
00:58:23,417 --> 00:58:24,625
Your hand.

907
00:58:26,167 --> 00:58:28,708
Oh. It's fine.
It's just a little, um...

908
00:58:28,792 --> 00:58:29,792
No.

909
00:58:29,875 --> 00:58:32,958
I could probably get that later.

910
00:58:39,292 --> 00:58:40,292
Is that okay?

911
00:58:43,750 --> 00:58:44,750
Yeah.

912
00:58:55,917 --> 00:58:56,833
Thank you.

913
00:58:58,417 --> 00:58:59,417
You're welcome.

914
00:59:22,750 --> 00:59:23,750
I should go.

915
00:59:25,792 --> 00:59:28,083
Yeah, same.

916
00:59:28,167 --> 00:59:30,625
No, uh, supposed to rejoin the fleet today

917
00:59:30,708 --> 00:59:32,250
and I haven't even started to pack.

918
00:59:33,167 --> 00:59:34,375
You're really going back?

919
00:59:34,875 --> 00:59:35,875
Yeah.

920
00:59:36,458 --> 00:59:37,458
Why?

921
00:59:40,250 --> 00:59:42,833
I guess I didn't find
a good enough reason to stay.

922
00:59:45,292 --> 00:59:47,125
Good luck, Rosaline.

923
00:59:48,500 --> 00:59:52,708
It was interesting getting to know you.

924
00:59:56,208 --> 00:59:57,208
You too, Dario.

925
01:00:53,083 --> 01:00:54,083
Late night?

926
01:00:54,167 --> 01:00:55,667
Oh! Oh, my God.

927
01:00:57,750 --> 01:00:59,250
You scared me.

928
01:00:59,333 --> 01:01:00,583
Good, that makes two of us.

929
01:01:05,000 --> 01:01:08,167
What on earth have you been
doing until six in the morning?

930
01:01:11,417 --> 01:01:12,542
It's complicated.

931
01:01:19,625 --> 01:01:21,500
Nurse, can I ask you something?

932
01:01:25,542 --> 01:01:26,750
Have you ever been in love?

933
01:01:28,333 --> 01:01:31,042
I was, once.

934
01:01:34,125 --> 01:01:35,333
And what did it feel like?

935
01:01:39,917 --> 01:01:41,542
It's a bit like having vertigo.

936
01:01:43,958 --> 01:01:45,708
Quite a lot like being drunk.

937
01:01:46,833 --> 01:01:49,333
But when it's real, you won't question it.

938
01:03:33,708 --> 01:03:35,292
Yeah, what up, man?

939
01:03:35,375 --> 01:03:36,875
Uh, special delivery.

940
01:03:37,917 --> 01:03:40,083
Thanks, Chief.

941
01:03:40,167 --> 01:03:44,500
Yeah, yeah. Oh, oh, also, um,
I got an envelope.

942
01:03:45,417 --> 01:03:49,583
A miss H-H-Huliet. J... Hu... Juliet.

943
01:03:49,667 --> 01:03:51,083
- Ju...
- I'll see that she gets it.

944
01:03:51,792 --> 01:03:54,333
All right, man. All right, right on.

945
01:04:11,542 --> 01:04:12,542
Oh.

946
01:04:14,333 --> 01:04:16,500
Steve, I just saw you.

947
01:04:20,250 --> 01:04:21,250
You back already?

948
01:04:21,333 --> 01:04:23,458
Uh, yes, Miss Rosaline.

949
01:04:24,417 --> 01:04:29,167
I was just, uh, you know.

950
01:04:31,542 --> 01:04:32,833
Did she seem pleased?

951
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:35,625
Yeah. Pleased?

952
01:04:35,708 --> 01:04:36,625
Mmm.

953
01:04:36,708 --> 01:04:37,792
Juliet!

954
01:04:38,458 --> 01:04:40,125
- Oh, oh.
- When you gave her the letter.

955
01:04:40,208 --> 01:04:41,250
- Oh.
- Yeah.

956
01:04:41,333 --> 01:04:44,917
Um, I-I gave it to the big dude instead.

957
01:04:45,917 --> 01:04:47,625
Big dude?

958
01:04:47,708 --> 01:04:49,708
W-W-What dude? W-Which dude?

959
01:04:50,708 --> 01:04:52,167
Uh, Master Tybalt.

960
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:54,958
Shit.

961
01:04:55,042 --> 01:04:56,708
Ros, Ros!

962
01:04:56,792 --> 01:04:57,875
What?

963
01:04:57,958 --> 01:04:59,083
Oh, hey.

964
01:04:59,167 --> 01:05:00,625
It's Romeo and Tybalt.

965
01:05:00,708 --> 01:05:01,792
Oh.

966
01:05:05,000 --> 01:05:06,667
You cream-faced loon!

967
01:05:06,750 --> 01:05:08,500
What have you to say for yourself?

968
01:05:08,583 --> 01:05:11,750
- Thou art as fat as butter.
- Venomous toad!

969
01:05:11,833 --> 01:05:13,125
Mercutio.

970
01:05:13,208 --> 01:05:15,333
- How dare you speak like that!
- I'll speak any way I wish!

971
01:05:15,417 --> 01:05:16,542
Father, please!

972
01:05:16,625 --> 01:05:18,583
Miscreants!
Look what you've done.

973
01:05:20,875 --> 01:05:22,917
Tybalt is dead.
I should kill all of you!

974
01:05:23,000 --> 01:05:24,458
I'd like to see you try.

975
01:05:24,542 --> 01:05:26,042
- Stop this!
- You great rooting hog!

976
01:05:26,125 --> 01:05:28,000
Your son is a murderer.

977
01:05:28,083 --> 01:05:31,500
It was self-defense.
Fire-eyed fury be my conduct now.

978
01:05:31,583 --> 01:05:32,667
You liar!

979
01:05:32,750 --> 01:05:34,250
He's not lying.

980
01:05:34,333 --> 01:05:39,500
He's honest and kind, and a good person.

981
01:05:39,583 --> 01:05:42,583
His heart knows no hate or anger.

982
01:05:42,667 --> 01:05:44,417
If he says that he was challenged,

983
01:05:44,500 --> 01:05:46,458
then I promise you
that he's telling the truth.

984
01:05:46,542 --> 01:05:49,625
I'm sorry. How do you know him?

985
01:05:57,125 --> 01:05:58,500
He's my husband.

986
01:05:58,583 --> 01:05:59,625
- Oh, my God.
- We're in love.

987
01:05:59,708 --> 01:06:01,250
I can't even watch them.

988
01:06:01,333 --> 01:06:03,333
- Ah.
- Oh, boy.

989
01:06:03,417 --> 01:06:05,750
You will never see him again.

990
01:06:05,833 --> 01:06:08,917
And you will be banished.
Never to set foot in Verona again.

991
01:06:09,000 --> 01:06:09,833
No!

992
01:06:09,917 --> 01:06:13,708
You will have this farce annulled
and marry Count Paris in the morrow.

993
01:06:13,792 --> 01:06:14,792
Father, no!

994
01:06:14,875 --> 01:06:17,000
- Uh, I'm sorry, what?
- You can't do this!

995
01:06:17,083 --> 01:06:19,583
Y-Yeah. Tomorrow doesn't
really work for me either. So…

996
01:06:19,667 --> 01:06:20,500
Guards!

997
01:06:21,375 --> 01:06:22,750
- No!
- Detain him!

998
01:06:22,833 --> 01:06:24,292
He's getting away!

999
01:06:24,375 --> 01:06:25,542
Run, my heart!

1000
01:06:25,625 --> 01:06:28,250
I won't let them keep us apart, my love!

1001
01:06:29,250 --> 01:06:31,750
You know what this means, Lord Montague?

1002
01:06:31,833 --> 01:06:33,667
Yes, I do, Lord Capulet.

1003
01:06:34,583 --> 01:06:36,042
It means war!

1004
01:06:36,125 --> 01:06:37,167
You bald-headed peasant!

1005
01:06:37,250 --> 01:06:38,917
I'll see you soon, calf guts!

1006
01:06:39,000 --> 01:06:40,333
- Give...
- Will you?

1007
01:06:40,417 --> 01:06:41,333
Stop.

1008
01:06:41,417 --> 01:06:42,917
Summon my army for battle!

1009
01:06:43,000 --> 01:06:47,167
Juliet, I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry.
I'll fix this. I'll find a way.

1010
01:06:47,250 --> 01:06:49,042
Haven't you done enough already?

1011
01:07:00,542 --> 01:07:05,667
Oh, thank God you're still here.

1012
01:07:07,542 --> 01:07:08,875
Uh, okay.

1013
01:07:09,500 --> 01:07:12,917
I don't know if you heard about
the whole Romeo and Juliet thing?

1014
01:07:13,000 --> 01:07:14,833
- But things got a little out of hand.
- Yeah.

1015
01:07:14,917 --> 01:07:15,917
I heard.

1016
01:07:16,500 --> 01:07:20,083
But not to worry. I've come up
with a plan to fix everything.

1017
01:07:20,167 --> 01:07:21,875
It's just gonna take you and I to...

1018
01:07:21,958 --> 01:07:25,792
Oh, I'm sorry. Wait.
You want my help with this?

1019
01:07:25,875 --> 01:07:27,667
I told you. I don't get involved.

1020
01:07:27,750 --> 01:07:29,042
Fine, except...

1021
01:07:29,125 --> 01:07:32,417
Besides, the last time I helped you,
we were almost killed.

1022
01:07:32,500 --> 01:07:34,042
Okay, but that's...

1023
01:07:34,125 --> 01:07:35,375
There is no "but," Rosaline.

1024
01:07:35,458 --> 01:07:38,750
Okay. Could you just at least
put on a shirt or something?

1025
01:07:49,542 --> 01:07:50,583
Why?

1026
01:07:50,667 --> 01:07:55,542
Because I'm trying to have
a conversation here, and it's...

1027
01:07:57,250 --> 01:07:58,500
It's distracting.

1028
01:08:06,250 --> 01:08:07,792
So I've made some mistakes.

1029
01:08:09,375 --> 01:08:11,042
Okay, a lot of mistakes.

1030
01:08:12,500 --> 01:08:15,292
I was wrong about Romeo.
I was wrong about Juliet.

1031
01:08:15,375 --> 01:08:18,750
I-I was even wrong about me
in a lot of ways.

1032
01:08:18,833 --> 01:08:22,000
But I know that
I'm not wrong about this, Dario.

1033
01:08:22,083 --> 01:08:23,750
We need to make this right.

1034
01:08:23,833 --> 01:08:24,958
There's that "we" again.

1035
01:08:26,750 --> 01:08:28,500
Yes, we.

1036
01:08:28,583 --> 01:08:31,042
'Cause another thing
I was wrong about, is you.

1037
01:08:34,875 --> 01:08:36,625
You're completely full of shit.

1038
01:08:37,583 --> 01:08:38,542
Oh, yeah?

1039
01:08:38,625 --> 01:08:42,875
The whole, "Oh, mmm, I don't care
about other people. I just...

1040
01:08:42,958 --> 01:08:45,208
I don't wanna get involved" nonsense.

1041
01:08:45,792 --> 01:08:47,500
It's a big load of crap, Dario.

1042
01:08:48,625 --> 01:08:50,125
You care about people.

1043
01:08:51,750 --> 01:08:53,042
You're a good person.

1044
01:08:55,833 --> 01:08:58,000
This is 'cause I have a boat, isn't it?

1045
01:08:58,583 --> 01:09:00,000
No, that's...

1046
01:09:00,083 --> 01:09:01,208
They're in trouble.

1047
01:09:02,167 --> 01:09:05,667
They're in trouble, and I'm responsible.

1048
01:09:06,542 --> 01:09:08,458
I need to fix this.

1049
01:09:10,625 --> 01:09:11,917
Will you please help me?

1050
01:09:16,542 --> 01:09:18,417
First sign of danger and I'm out of there.

1051
01:09:19,208 --> 01:09:20,542
- Fine.
- Seriously.

1052
01:09:20,625 --> 01:09:22,292
I'm not getting killed over this.

1053
01:09:22,375 --> 01:09:23,875
Yeah, I-I-I just said fine.

1054
01:09:33,583 --> 01:09:34,583
Okay.

1055
01:09:36,833 --> 01:09:38,792
Let's go save true love.

1056
01:09:38,875 --> 01:09:42,167
Great. Um…

1057
01:09:42,250 --> 01:09:43,833
Is it cool if we borrow the boat?

1058
01:09:59,917 --> 01:10:01,542
Shh. Now be quiet.

1059
01:10:01,625 --> 01:10:02,542
Ow.

1060
01:10:02,625 --> 01:10:03,917
Rosaline!

1061
01:10:05,917 --> 01:10:07,208
Hey.

1062
01:10:07,292 --> 01:10:08,750
What are you doing here?

1063
01:10:08,833 --> 01:10:11,292
I have come to help you.

1064
01:10:12,167 --> 01:10:14,125
I don't want your help, Rosaline.

1065
01:10:14,208 --> 01:10:15,250
I know that.

1066
01:10:15,333 --> 01:10:18,083
And again,
I'm really, really, really sorry.

1067
01:10:18,167 --> 01:10:22,458
But we've got a boat.

1068
01:10:22,542 --> 01:10:25,667
Well, actually... actually, Dario...
Dario has a boat.

1069
01:10:25,750 --> 01:10:26,667
Hello.

1070
01:10:26,750 --> 01:10:28,917
We'll get Romeo,
smuggle you both to the docks,

1071
01:10:29,000 --> 01:10:30,458
and then, under the cover of darkness,

1072
01:10:30,542 --> 01:10:33,417
you'll sail to safety before anyone
realizes that you're gone.

1073
01:10:35,375 --> 01:10:39,500
That's, um, very kind of you, Cousin.

1074
01:10:40,708 --> 01:10:41,917
But I already have a plan.

1075
01:10:43,292 --> 01:10:44,292
You do?

1076
01:10:46,333 --> 01:10:49,250
Okay, that's... that's great.

1077
01:10:49,333 --> 01:10:51,458
Uh, w-what is it?

1078
01:10:51,542 --> 01:10:53,458
I'm going to fake my own death.

1079
01:10:54,583 --> 01:10:55,583
Sorry, what?

1080
01:10:55,667 --> 01:10:56,500
It's simple.

1081
01:10:56,583 --> 01:11:00,917
There's this potion that causes
total body paralysis for hours at a time.

1082
01:11:01,000 --> 01:11:03,500
I'll drink it, they'll find me,
it'll look like I'm dead,

1083
01:11:03,583 --> 01:11:05,125
then they'll prepare me for burial.

1084
01:11:05,917 --> 01:11:07,500
Then, once they leave, I'll wake up.

1085
01:11:08,292 --> 01:11:09,667
Romeo will then come out of hiding.

1086
01:11:09,750 --> 01:11:13,167
He's at the Montague chapel
with Benvolio right now.

1087
01:11:14,000 --> 01:11:16,833
Then he'll find me in the church,
carry me off into the sunset,

1088
01:11:16,917 --> 01:11:18,917
and we'll live happily ever after.

1089
01:11:19,625 --> 01:11:20,625
It's foolproof.

1090
01:11:21,583 --> 01:11:23,625
Mmm, okay. Juliet,

1091
01:11:24,375 --> 01:11:28,917
that is quite possibly the dumbest fucking
thing I've ever heard in my life.

1092
01:11:29,000 --> 01:11:29,958
Are you kidding me?

1093
01:11:30,042 --> 01:11:32,750
There's, like, 50 different ways that
that could go wrong.

1094
01:11:32,833 --> 01:11:34,917
I mean,
what if the potion has side effects?

1095
01:11:36,292 --> 01:11:39,292
What if they actually bury you?
Have you thought of that?

1096
01:11:39,875 --> 01:11:41,583
What if Romeo thinks you're really dead?

1097
01:11:42,458 --> 01:11:45,333
I've... I've sent Steve the Courier
to tell him.

1098
01:11:45,417 --> 01:11:47,583
Steve the Courier is an idiot!

1099
01:11:47,667 --> 01:11:48,792
You've gotta trust me.

1100
01:11:48,875 --> 01:11:51,208
My plan is better. Let's go.

1101
01:11:51,708 --> 01:11:52,708
Juliet?

1102
01:11:52,792 --> 01:11:54,292
What did... What...

1103
01:12:00,167 --> 01:12:01,333
Did you drink it already?

1104
01:12:03,833 --> 01:12:06,375
Okay. All right.

1105
01:12:06,458 --> 01:12:09,958
When you wake up, you'll be right
next to Romeo, okay? I promise.

1106
01:12:10,042 --> 01:12:11,500
Everything's gonna be just fine.

1107
01:12:11,583 --> 01:12:13,542
Okay, wow.

1108
01:12:13,625 --> 01:12:16,417
Dario, you ready?

1109
01:12:16,500 --> 01:12:17,833
Yeah, I am.

1110
01:12:17,917 --> 01:12:18,917
You sure?

1111
01:12:19,000 --> 01:12:22,375
Yes, just toss her to me.

1112
01:12:23,542 --> 01:12:25,250
Okay. On three.

1113
01:12:26,458 --> 01:12:29,500
One…

1114
01:12:31,375 --> 01:12:32,500
Nope. Oh...

1115
01:12:33,000 --> 01:12:36,083
One.

1116
01:12:36,167 --> 01:12:37,583
Juliet?

1117
01:12:37,667 --> 01:12:38,583
Shit.

1118
01:12:39,417 --> 01:12:40,417
Juliet!

1119
01:12:40,500 --> 01:12:42,458
Wake up, Juliet!

1120
01:12:42,542 --> 01:12:44,083
Dario, save yourself.

1121
01:12:45,167 --> 01:12:46,958
Open this door at once!

1122
01:12:47,417 --> 01:12:49,167
That sneaky son of a bitch!

1123
01:12:49,250 --> 01:12:50,292
Juliet!

1124
01:12:52,292 --> 01:12:53,792
Okay, it's not what it looks like.

1125
01:12:56,292 --> 01:12:57,417
If you just...

1126
01:12:57,958 --> 01:12:59,167
If you just let me explain.

1127
01:12:59,250 --> 01:13:03,208
I think we could really just have
a nice talk and talk about it.

1128
01:13:03,292 --> 01:13:05,042
And I can explain everything. Please.

1129
01:13:09,250 --> 01:13:10,250
Okay.

1130
01:13:18,542 --> 01:13:19,417
Oh, thank God.

1131
01:13:19,500 --> 01:13:21,750
Okay, you have got to help me, Father.

1132
01:13:21,833 --> 01:13:24,167
They found Juliet in your arms.

1133
01:13:24,250 --> 01:13:25,625
Yeah, I know.

1134
01:13:25,708 --> 01:13:27,583
And I... I can explain that,

1135
01:13:27,667 --> 01:13:30,042
but right now, I just need you
to help me get out of here.

1136
01:13:30,125 --> 01:13:33,000
Rosaline, your cousin is dead.

1137
01:13:33,083 --> 01:13:35,167
- Who knows she's dead?
- The whole town.

1138
01:13:35,250 --> 01:13:37,583
Okay, look.

1139
01:13:38,583 --> 01:13:42,167
Things seem really bad right now.
I get it.

1140
01:13:42,250 --> 01:13:46,875
But you know me, and you know
I would never ever hurt Juliet.

1141
01:13:49,167 --> 01:13:53,250
Look, I know I'm not exactly
the daughter you wish I was

1142
01:13:53,333 --> 01:13:59,167
but, just this once,
I need you to trust me, please.

1143
01:14:02,833 --> 01:14:04,750
I honestly don't know what to think.

1144
01:14:11,958 --> 01:14:15,083
But you will always be
the daughter I wish you were.

1145
01:14:20,208 --> 01:14:22,667
Guards! A Montague. Over there!

1146
01:14:22,750 --> 01:14:24,542
Go! Go!

1147
01:14:24,625 --> 01:14:26,792
Halt. Don't let him get away!

1148
01:14:34,667 --> 01:14:36,167
My lord.

1149
01:14:36,750 --> 01:14:38,417
Juliet Capulet is dead.

1150
01:14:38,500 --> 01:14:39,958
Suicide, apparently.

1151
01:14:40,042 --> 01:14:41,708
They're burying her body in the church.

1152
01:14:43,125 --> 01:14:45,542
Where Juliet lies,
Romeo shan't be far away.

1153
01:14:46,667 --> 01:14:48,667
We must get to him
before the Capulets. Come!

1154
01:15:10,333 --> 01:15:11,542
Okay.

1155
01:15:12,792 --> 01:15:14,000
Uh…

1156
01:15:15,667 --> 01:15:19,708
It's okay. It's okay. You got this.

1157
01:15:20,417 --> 01:15:24,417
Just pretend they're something else.
You know, leaves with gaping mouths.

1158
01:15:28,083 --> 01:15:29,583
Okay, just get in.

1159
01:15:29,667 --> 01:15:32,125
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. I'm in. I'm in.

1160
01:15:32,208 --> 01:15:35,333
Okay. Yes.

1161
01:15:35,417 --> 01:15:37,375
Oh, my God. What was that? What was that?

1162
01:15:37,458 --> 01:15:39,000
What was that?

1163
01:15:39,083 --> 01:15:42,625
Okay. It's just a leaf.
It was just a leaf.

1164
01:15:43,458 --> 01:15:44,750
Mmm, just a leaf.

1165
01:15:44,833 --> 01:15:47,417
I made it. I made it.

1166
01:15:49,875 --> 01:15:50,958
This is not gonna work.

1167
01:15:54,250 --> 01:15:56,292
My lady, your clothes.

1168
01:15:56,375 --> 01:15:57,583
Where's... Where's Romeo?

1169
01:15:59,208 --> 01:16:01,750
Um. I, uh...

1170
01:16:03,750 --> 01:16:06,167
Focus. Did he get the message?

1171
01:16:06,667 --> 01:16:08,417
- What message?
- From Juliet.

1172
01:16:08,500 --> 01:16:11,000
Oh, my God.

1173
01:16:11,583 --> 01:16:13,042
Okay. Okay.

1174
01:16:13,125 --> 01:16:14,792
- Can, uh...
- Mmm. Mm-hmm.

1175
01:16:15,292 --> 01:16:16,417
Oh, dear God.

1176
01:16:35,000 --> 01:16:36,000
Oh, no, no, no.

1177
01:16:36,083 --> 01:16:39,083
Oh, my God.

1178
01:16:39,167 --> 01:16:41,667
- Uh, Rosaline, no. You...
- You! You get out of my way!

1179
01:16:43,625 --> 01:16:45,167
Oh. Oh, my God.

1180
01:16:45,667 --> 01:16:47,458
No, no, it's not real.

1181
01:16:47,542 --> 01:16:49,458
Juliet's alive. She's al...

1182
01:16:49,542 --> 01:16:51,625
Get a grip, Rosaline.

1183
01:16:51,708 --> 01:16:53,208
I was trying to tell you.

1184
01:16:53,292 --> 01:16:55,375
But you... you ran away.

1185
01:16:55,458 --> 01:16:56,750
As fast as I could.

1186
01:16:56,833 --> 01:16:59,208
Oh, you ran to him.

1187
01:16:59,292 --> 01:17:00,542
Someone had to.

1188
01:17:00,625 --> 01:17:03,417
I mean, the kid was gonna off himself
when he heard the news.

1189
01:17:05,500 --> 01:17:08,417
Uh, what now?

1190
01:17:09,083 --> 01:17:13,083
He said you would know what to do
because you're a… genius?

1191
01:17:16,500 --> 01:17:17,667
Hmm.

1192
01:17:17,750 --> 01:17:20,208
Okay, lay down as you were.

1193
01:17:20,875 --> 01:17:23,042
Close your eyes. Quickly.

1194
01:17:24,875 --> 01:17:26,042
Now you're both dead.

1195
01:17:26,667 --> 01:17:28,917
Star-crossed lovers
that couldn't live apart.

1196
01:17:29,000 --> 01:17:30,000
That's pretty good.

1197
01:17:30,083 --> 01:17:31,708
Uh, you think that's gonna work?

1198
01:17:32,333 --> 01:17:34,250
I mean, it might if she doesn't wake up.

1199
01:17:40,417 --> 01:17:41,458
Oh!

1200
01:17:41,542 --> 01:17:44,333
Heaven forsake me!

1201
01:17:44,417 --> 01:17:46,875
Oh, no! Why?

1202
01:17:49,500 --> 01:17:51,500
What is she doing here?

1203
01:17:51,583 --> 01:17:54,208
- Rosaline?
- What are all of you doing here?

1204
01:17:54,292 --> 01:17:56,625
Where is my boy? Where is he?

1205
01:17:57,208 --> 01:17:58,417
Lord Montague.

1206
01:17:59,458 --> 01:18:01,875
I'm sorry, but I'm afraid you're too late.

1207
01:18:01,958 --> 01:18:02,958
No.

1208
01:18:05,625 --> 01:18:08,500
Dear, foolish boy.

1209
01:18:08,583 --> 01:18:11,333
There were so many things
I never got to tell you.

1210
01:18:11,833 --> 01:18:14,292
Come back to me!

1211
01:18:14,375 --> 01:18:16,667
- Oh. All right, well...
- Foolish boy!

1212
01:18:16,750 --> 01:18:18,250
Come back to me!

1213
01:18:18,333 --> 01:18:20,708
Uh, shaking him won't bring him back. So…

1214
01:18:27,250 --> 01:18:30,000
Sorry, wrong pipe.

1215
01:18:30,667 --> 01:18:34,792
Capulet, your daughter
is responsible for the death of my son!

1216
01:18:34,875 --> 01:18:36,583
You are such a liar!

1217
01:18:37,083 --> 01:18:40,750
Truth be told, Montague,
you are the one to blame.

1218
01:18:40,833 --> 01:18:43,167
I should kill you now.

1219
01:18:43,250 --> 01:18:45,833
For the love of God!

1220
01:18:45,917 --> 01:18:48,333
Will you stop fighting?

1221
01:18:48,417 --> 01:18:50,333
This is all your faults.

1222
01:18:50,417 --> 01:18:51,917
- You.
- What?

1223
01:18:52,000 --> 01:18:53,000
And you.

1224
01:18:53,583 --> 01:18:55,792
Every single one of you people.

1225
01:18:55,875 --> 01:18:57,500
They'd still be alive if not for

1226
01:18:57,583 --> 01:19:03,000
your baseless judgments and blind hatred
and petty squabbling.

1227
01:19:03,083 --> 01:19:05,250
Adrian, control your daughter.

1228
01:19:05,333 --> 01:19:07,042
Shut it, Mario. Let her speak.

1229
01:19:08,583 --> 01:19:09,792
He was a Montague.

1230
01:19:10,500 --> 01:19:12,000
She was a Capulet.

1231
01:19:12,708 --> 01:19:13,708
So what?

1232
01:19:15,250 --> 01:19:18,708
That didn't stop them from
seeing the beauty in each other.

1233
01:19:20,125 --> 01:19:22,667
That didn't stop them
from falling in love.

1234
01:19:23,542 --> 01:19:25,042
You know what did stop them?

1235
01:19:26,958 --> 01:19:28,167
You did.

1236
01:19:29,917 --> 01:19:32,375
This... This stupid war.

1237
01:19:32,458 --> 01:19:34,500
This... This... This selfishness.

1238
01:19:34,583 --> 01:19:37,250
Shame on you!

1239
01:19:39,458 --> 01:19:41,625
And... And... And shame on your houses!

1240
01:19:41,708 --> 01:19:42,708
A little unfair.

1241
01:19:44,292 --> 01:19:45,667
Mmm, she's right, you know?

1242
01:19:47,292 --> 01:19:49,167
- Well, it is our fault.
- Mmm?

1243
01:19:49,250 --> 01:19:51,417
- Theirs mostly.
- Ah, that's what I meant.

1244
01:19:51,500 --> 01:19:55,000
The two of you
with your heads stuck right up your asses.

1245
01:19:55,083 --> 01:19:57,667
Oh, no.

1246
01:19:57,750 --> 01:19:58,750
Mmm.

1247
01:20:01,042 --> 01:20:03,500
Perhaps enough blood has been shed.

1248
01:20:05,917 --> 01:20:08,083
Let's end this war, Capulet.

1249
01:20:08,917 --> 01:20:12,000
If their deaths be the last,
they shall not have died in vain.

1250
01:20:13,250 --> 01:20:15,500
So, let our families be close.

1251
01:20:15,583 --> 01:20:18,583
United by the loss we share today.

1252
01:20:19,708 --> 01:20:21,583
May peace reign here a while, hmm?

1253
01:20:22,167 --> 01:20:24,042
And let their spirits rest in Heaven.

1254
01:20:24,542 --> 01:20:31,292
May angels sing their
praises in their resting place.

1255
01:20:31,875 --> 01:20:35,750
Let their names be inscribed in marble
across the land.

1256
01:20:35,833 --> 01:20:36,833
Good marble.

1257
01:20:36,917 --> 01:20:40,792
Expensive marble.
Rich Corinthian marble. Porphyry.

1258
01:20:41,500 --> 01:20:42,625
Porphyry's good.

1259
01:20:42,708 --> 01:20:44,542
- And even wood.
- What?

1260
01:20:44,625 --> 01:20:45,625
Wood?

1261
01:20:45,708 --> 01:20:49,333
Wooden doors,
no, church doors. Fountains.

1262
01:20:49,417 --> 01:20:52,292
- Mmm. Good call.
- Oh, w-what? Oh, she's alive!

1263
01:20:52,375 --> 01:20:55,708
My daughter?

1264
01:20:57,042 --> 01:20:59,417
Romeo, Romeo!

1265
01:21:00,417 --> 01:21:05,250
I will kiss thy lips. Haply some poison
yet doth remain on them.

1266
01:21:05,333 --> 01:21:06,833
- Juliet, no!
- No! Uh...

1267
01:21:08,792 --> 01:21:10,458
Thy lips are warm.

1268
01:21:10,542 --> 01:21:14,167
Ju...

1269
01:21:17,500 --> 01:21:18,917
Okay, what the hell was that?

1270
01:21:19,417 --> 01:21:21,000
Is there a doctor in the house?

1271
01:21:21,083 --> 01:21:23,833
Yeah, yeah,
we'd like to have some confirmation.

1272
01:21:23,917 --> 01:21:26,042
Step aside. Step aside.

1273
01:21:26,125 --> 01:21:29,000
Thank you. Thank you.
Professional coming through.

1274
01:21:38,833 --> 01:21:39,917
Yes.

1275
01:21:40,958 --> 01:21:42,833
They are definitely dead.

1276
01:21:42,917 --> 01:21:45,167
- Oh!
- How can you be sure?

1277
01:21:45,917 --> 01:21:47,292
How can I be sure?

1278
01:21:48,208 --> 01:21:53,708
For the love of God,
I am a registered bloody nurse!

1279
01:21:54,333 --> 01:21:55,833
I thought that was just your name.

1280
01:21:55,917 --> 01:21:57,458
No, my name's Janet.

1281
01:21:58,625 --> 01:22:01,083
Well, Montagues, Capulets, anon.

1282
01:22:01,167 --> 01:22:02,667
Capulets, anon.

1283
01:22:02,750 --> 01:22:04,875
Capulets, anon.

1284
01:22:05,708 --> 01:22:07,708
Mmm, they couldn't...

1285
01:22:08,542 --> 01:22:10,208
They couldn't live in peace.

1286
01:22:12,417 --> 01:22:14,167
At least let them rest in it.

1287
01:22:20,375 --> 01:22:24,250
Let us take our leave
of this dreary scene.

1288
01:22:24,917 --> 01:22:26,917
I know a very fine spot.

1289
01:22:37,875 --> 01:22:39,875
Okay, they're gone. You can wake up now.

1290
01:22:42,667 --> 01:22:44,000
I love you so much.

1291
01:22:44,083 --> 01:22:47,125
- I love you so much more.
- I love you so much more.

1292
01:22:55,000 --> 01:22:56,083
Tell me the truth.

1293
01:22:57,542 --> 01:22:59,458
You could be halfway to Venice by now.

1294
01:23:00,625 --> 01:23:01,875
What made you come back?

1295
01:23:04,917 --> 01:23:06,083
I don't know.

1296
01:23:06,167 --> 01:23:09,333
There's just something about you
that makes me do stupid things.

1297
01:23:21,958 --> 01:23:24,792
Well, I'll never forget you, Rosaline.

1298
01:23:24,875 --> 01:23:26,167
Back at you, Romeo.

1299
01:23:26,250 --> 01:23:27,417
It's been real.

1300
01:23:27,958 --> 01:23:30,167
Get in here. Ah.

1301
01:23:35,625 --> 01:23:36,625
Okay.

1302
01:23:36,708 --> 01:23:42,917
So, you should plan to land
at Paphos Harbor.

1303
01:23:43,000 --> 01:23:45,500
But if the wind picks up
and you end up at the Meleti Forest,

1304
01:23:45,583 --> 01:23:47,375
that's also supposed to be really great.

1305
01:23:50,458 --> 01:23:55,375
Thank you, Rosaline, for everything.

1306
01:23:57,375 --> 01:23:58,625
What are cousins for?

1307
01:24:06,083 --> 01:24:09,542
Whilst the Heavens and Earth
circle vermilion stars, so are...

1308
01:24:09,625 --> 01:24:11,042
Romeo, just get in the boat.

1309
01:24:11,125 --> 01:24:12,250
Yes, milady.

1310
01:24:15,750 --> 01:24:18,292
- Okay, buddy.
- And you...

1311
01:24:18,792 --> 01:24:20,792
Thank you.

1312
01:24:21,875 --> 01:24:24,000
Okay.

1313
01:24:47,000 --> 01:24:48,625
I'm really gonna miss that boat.

1314
01:24:49,167 --> 01:24:50,167
I know.

1315
01:24:54,833 --> 01:24:56,292
Have you ever been to Cyprus?

1316
01:24:56,792 --> 01:24:58,167
No. Have you?

1317
01:24:58,250 --> 01:24:59,250
No.

1318
01:25:04,708 --> 01:25:05,708
It's an island.

1319
01:25:07,167 --> 01:25:08,167
Yeah.

1320
01:25:08,667 --> 01:25:09,667
Mmm.

1321
01:25:25,625 --> 01:25:26,875
Let me ask you something.

1322
01:25:29,125 --> 01:25:30,125
Yeah?

1323
01:25:31,458 --> 01:25:35,042
Would you, uh, ever...

1324
01:25:37,042 --> 01:25:41,958
You know, if I got another boat.
Maybe wanna...

1325
01:25:56,750 --> 01:25:57,750
I'll think about it.

1326
01:26:16,792 --> 01:26:20,792
You know, centuries from now,
when everyone's telling this story,

1327
01:26:21,667 --> 01:26:23,792
you think you and I
will even be mentioned?

1328
01:26:26,833 --> 01:26:31,375
Honestly… I couldn't care less.

1329
01:26:33,458 --> 01:26:34,458
Me neither.

1330
01:27:14,792 --> 01:27:15,792
Do you like sports?

1331
01:27:17,208 --> 01:27:20,042
Um, not really.

1332
01:27:20,958 --> 01:27:21,958
Okay.

1333
01:27:25,083 --> 01:27:26,083
Food?

1334
01:27:26,750 --> 01:27:27,750
What?

1335
01:27:28,708 --> 01:27:32,917
Do you like food?

1336
01:27:34,375 --> 01:27:35,708
Do I like food?

1337
01:27:35,792 --> 01:27:39,042
Like, what's your favorite food?
What would your favorite food be?

1338
01:27:42,125 --> 01:27:43,417
I like... I like pizza.

1339
01:27:44,000 --> 01:27:45,250
- Oh.
- Uh, probably pizza.

1340
01:27:45,333 --> 01:27:46,333
Mm-hmm.

1341
01:27:51,000 --> 01:27:55,792
Mmm.

1342
01:27:56,292 --> 01:27:57,375
You don't like pizza?

1343
01:27:57,458 --> 01:27:59,625
I am lactose intolerant.

1344
01:28:07,333 --> 01:28:08,333
I like veal.

1345
01:28:10,500 --> 01:28:11,500
Baby cow?

1346
01:28:11,583 --> 01:28:12,583
Is it?

1347
01:28:14,125 --> 01:28:15,125
Oh.

1348
01:28:19,000 --> 01:28:22,833
Just seven more hours to go.

1349
01:28:26,375 --> 01:28:31,083
Then… the rest of our lives.

1350
01:28:33,125 --> 01:28:34,125
Right.

1351
01:28:35,875 --> 01:28:36,875
Yes.
