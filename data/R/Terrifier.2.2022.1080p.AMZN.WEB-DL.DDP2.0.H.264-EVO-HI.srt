to share that with us?

Monica Do you still feel
that way?

369
00:32:00,251 --> 00:32:01,384

People are frightened

370
00:32:01,386 --> 00:32:04,820
by the way that I look,
especially children.

371
00:32:04,822 --> 00:32:08,224
And it's really difficult for me
to deal with that,

372
00:32:08,226 --> 00:32:09,627
so isolation is ideal.

373
00:32:11,129 --> 00:32:13,629

your attacker?

374
00:32:13,631 --> 00:32:15,400
The man only identified
as Art the Clown.

375
00:32:16,668 --> 00:32:18,000
Well, there's a lot
of controversy

376

surrounding his supposed death.

377
00:32:20,038 --> 00:32:21,337
The authorities issued
a statement,

378
00:32:21,339 --> 00:32:22,872
claiming that his body
disappeared

379
00:32:22,874 --> 00:32:25,374
from the county coroner's office
the morning after the attack.

380
