00:03:53,776 --> 00:03:54,911
Good morning.

3
00:03:56,478 --> 00:03:57,479
Lovely day, is it not?

4
00:03:58,581 --> 00:03:59,649
What can I do for you?

5
00:04:01,884 --> 00:04:03,953
I know it's been quite some
time since you sold to anyone,

6
00:04:03,986 --> 00:04:05,822
or traded for that matter.

7
00:04:05,855 --> 00:04:06,756
I'm not selling.

8
00:04:07,990 --> 00:04:09,491
But how about a trade?

9
00:04:09,524 --> 00:04:10,993
I have some goods that
my wife put together.

10
00:04:11,027 --> 00:04:12,061
I can't spare it.

11
00:04:15,798 --> 00:04:17,432
You're not the
least bit curious?

12
00:04:18,935 --> 00:04:20,502
I don't need
anything from you.

13
00:04:23,606 --> 00:04:24,539
Please.

14
00:04:25,608 --> 00:04:26,541
I have a family.

15
00:04:30,613 --> 00:04:31,914
They're not my responsibility.

16
00:04:42,658 --> 00:04:43,860
You're very luck out here.

17
00:04:46,494 --> 00:04:47,429
So peaceful.

18
00:04:50,166 --> 00:04:51,466
Miles away from anyone.

19
00:04:55,037 --> 00:04:55,938
You should go.

20
00:05:02,444 --> 00:05:03,946
Perhaps I'll see
you again sometime.

21
00:05:07,583 --> 00:05:08,516
God bless.

22
00:05:33,541 --> 00:05:34,509
Who's that?

23
00:05:34,542 --> 00:05:35,978
He's a villain.

24
00:05:36,012 --> 00:05:37,445
Why?

25
00:05:37,479 --> 00:05:39,882
He steals girls like you,

26
00:05:39,916 --> 00:05:42,450
takes them away from
their mother forever.

27
00:05:42,484 --> 00:05:44,552
That's why they can
never know about you.

28
00:06:22,591 --> 00:06:24,794
Look how radiant you skin is.

29
00:06:28,998 --> 00:06:30,199
That feels good.

30
00:06:31,901 --> 00:06:33,501
The others will be so impressed.

31
00:06:51,754 --> 00:06:52,989
Why not help that man today?

32
00:06:56,659 --> 00:06:57,593
He's dangerous.

33
00:06:59,195 --> 00:07:00,495
Because he's desperate?

34
00:07:01,764 --> 00:07:02,798
He said he has a family.

35
00:07:04,133 --> 00:07:05,167
And if I helped him,
how could I refuse

36
00:07:05,201 --> 00:07:06,202
the next person, right?

37
00:07:07,770 --> 00:07:08,804
No exceptions.

38
00:07:10,306 --> 00:07:11,741
I suppose.

39
00:07:44,907 --> 00:07:45,841
Goodnight.

40
00:08:20,276 --> 00:08:22,244
These are dire times, indeed.

41
00:08:23,779 --> 00:08:26,849
To lose a life at
such a young age,

42
00:08:26,882 --> 00:08:30,186
is a tragedy no parent
should ever endure.

43
00:08:33,689 --> 00:08:34,924
Liam was my grandson,

44
00:08:34,957 --> 00:08:39,195
so this is an
especially hard day.

45
00:08:42,765 --> 00:08:45,768
But there is not a
single soul among us

46
00:08:48,437 --> 00:08:50,773
who could fathom
the depths of pain

47
00:08:50,806 --> 00:08:53,309
that the boys parents are
feeling at this very moment.

48
00:08:54,677 --> 00:08:55,611
Bridget,

49
00:08:57,012 --> 00:08:57,980
Colm, my son,

50
00:08:59,248 --> 00:09:01,050
I am so sorry for your loss.

51
00:09:03,152 --> 00:09:05,988
It might feel like this pain
will never pass, but it does.

52
00:09:07,223 --> 00:09:08,157
It will.

53
00:09:11,193 --> 00:09:13,295
And we will be here
for you both all of us.

54
00:09:19,001 --> 00:09:22,304
We will not allow
this time of darkness

55
00:09:23,973 --> 00:09:26,408
to extinguish the
everlasting light we have

56
00:09:27,810 --> 00:09:29,678
in our Lord Jesus Christ.

57
00:09:30,779 --> 00:09:33,115
Amen.

58
00:09:45,261 --> 00:09:47,229
How's your
William doing?

59
00:09:47,263 --> 00:09:49,198
No, Colm, don't.

60
00:09:49,231 --> 00:09:50,900
Colm.

61
00:09:50,933 --> 00:09:53,169
Whoa, whoa, whoa, stand.

62
00:09:53,202 --> 00:09:54,937
- Stand.
- Go home.

63
00:09:54,970 --> 00:09:55,938
- Forgive me.
- You must truly

64
00:09:55,971 --> 00:09:57,840
regard us as lower than dirt.

65
00:09:57,873 --> 00:09:59,175
- I beg your pardon.
- You see that?

66
00:09:59,208 --> 00:10:00,943
My wife and I buried
our son today.

67
00:10:00,976 --> 00:10:02,411
Well, then my
condolences to you both.

68
00:10:02,444 --> 00:10:05,314
You don't give a damn
about anybody at all!

69
00:10:05,347 --> 00:10:06,715
- Don't touch me.
- Or what?

70
00:10:07,983 --> 00:10:08,951
Or what, or what?

71
00:10:08,984 --> 00:10:10,319
Speak up, speak up!

72
00:10:11,453 --> 00:10:12,421
Speak up!

73
00:10:13,889 --> 00:10:15,357
You come through here
parading your abundance

74
00:10:15,391 --> 00:10:17,193
on the day of my son's funeral!

75
00:10:17,226 --> 00:10:18,861
I wasn't aware of the funeral.

76
00:10:18,894 --> 00:10:20,062
Flaunt it in front of
all these starving people!

77
00:10:20,095 --> 00:10:21,830
That was not my intent.

78
00:10:21,864 --> 00:10:23,032
We are the faithful ones.

79
00:10:23,065 --> 00:10:25,234
Yet, God smiles upon
you why is that?

80
00:10:25,267 --> 00:10:27,036
God's got nothing
to do with it.

81
00:10:28,904 --> 00:10:30,372
Everyone knows
what you are, Devil.

82
00:10:30,406 --> 00:10:32,374
Everyone knows what you are.

83
00:10:32,408 --> 00:10:34,043
- You creature.
- Please go!

84
00:10:34,076 --> 00:10:35,244
- Everyone knows.
- Keep away from there!

85
00:10:35,277 --> 00:10:36,812
Keep them, get away!

86
00:10:36,845 --> 00:10:38,247
Get away all of you!

87
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:41,217
Get away, get away, get away!

88
00:10:41,250 --> 00:10:42,985
Get off, get off there!

89
00:10:43,018 --> 00:10:44,954
- Get off there!
- That's enough!

90
00:10:44,987 --> 00:10:46,755
Return those to Miss Earnshaw.

91
00:10:54,463 --> 00:10:55,931
Are you all right?

92
00:10:57,333 --> 00:10:58,234
Thank you.

93
00:11:12,915 --> 00:11:15,517
You heard
what the man said?

94
00:15:12,387 --> 00:15:13,690
Colm Dwyer?

95
00:15:13,723 --> 00:15:16,225
He cursed her out
then he hit her.

96
00:15:16,258 --> 00:15:17,292
Despicable.

97
00:15:19,361 --> 00:15:20,262
I want to help.

98
00:15:22,130 --> 00:15:24,266
Make him regret it.

99
00:15:24,299 --> 00:15:25,768
He deserves it.

100
00:15:25,802 --> 00:15:27,035
But keep it secret.

101
00:15:30,372 --> 00:15:31,306
I wouldn't know how.

102
00:15:33,108 --> 00:15:34,076
Well, Darling,
what you have to do

103
00:15:34,109 --> 00:15:36,211
is you go to Colm's house,

104
00:15:36,245 --> 00:15:38,146
and you get something
from his son.

105
00:15:38,180 --> 00:15:39,314
We'll use it in the ingathering

106
00:15:39,348 --> 00:15:41,450
for our little
ceremony, all right.

107
00:15:42,518 --> 00:15:44,119
Don't tell your mom.

108
00:15:49,659 --> 00:15:50,559
Thank you.

109
00:15:58,835 --> 00:16:00,269
What was that all about?

110
00:16:00,302 --> 00:16:01,236
Nothing.

111
00:16:04,406 --> 00:16:05,307
Come on, let's go.

112
00:16:24,627 --> 00:16:27,162
- What is it?
- I have to pee.

113
00:16:46,348 --> 00:16:49,284
Hurry up or you'll have to
hold it the rest of the way.

114
00:16:49,318 --> 00:16:51,320
Otherwise you'll force
me back into the box?

115
00:16:51,353 --> 00:16:52,254
That's right.

116
00:16:53,856 --> 00:16:56,291
Would you say that to me
if I was the man who hit you?

117
00:16:58,861 --> 00:17:00,295
What do you want?

118
00:17:00,329 --> 00:17:02,431
I want to help, I'm ready.

119
00:17:02,464 --> 00:17:03,666
This is not the time
for that conversation...

120
00:17:03,700 --> 00:17:06,401
Both of those men threatened
you because they're unlucky.

121
00:17:06,435 --> 00:17:07,469
They think you're the villain.

122
00:17:07,502 --> 00:17:09,906
Who do you trust, them or me?

123
00:17:14,944 --> 00:17:16,679
Pardon my intrusion.

124
00:17:24,286 --> 00:17:25,588
It's Mr. Buckley, isn't it?

125
00:17:27,222 --> 00:17:28,156
Yes.

126
00:17:37,834 --> 00:17:38,768
Here.

127
00:17:41,303 --> 00:17:42,537
Here please take this.

128
00:17:44,607 --> 00:17:45,708
Uh.

129
00:17:47,744 --> 00:17:50,847
Please, sir, this
does not concern you.

130
00:17:54,549 --> 00:17:56,184
You're welcome to it all.

131
00:17:57,787 --> 00:17:59,789
What, everything?

132
00:17:59,822 --> 00:18:00,757
Everything.

133
00:18:07,930 --> 00:18:10,465
Just as long as you forget
what you have seen here today.

134
00:18:15,838 --> 00:18:17,406
It's settled then.

135
00:18:19,776 --> 00:18:21,611
Please, sir, this is
not as it appears.

136
00:18:22,912 --> 00:18:25,547
Oh, no, what is
it then, exactly?

137
00:18:27,549 --> 00:18:29,619
Sir, please take it.

138
00:18:29,652 --> 00:18:30,552
Let us be.

139
00:18:31,888 --> 00:18:32,822
Please.

140
00:18:38,260 --> 00:18:39,294
Here.

141
00:18:39,327 --> 00:18:40,495
No, no, that's enough.

142
00:18:40,529 --> 00:18:41,563
No.

143
00:18:41,597 --> 00:18:43,265
No, no that's enough I said!

144
00:18:44,332 --> 00:18:45,267
Goddamn you.

145
00:18:49,471 --> 00:18:50,372
I never seen you.

146
00:18:51,473 --> 00:18:53,475
Thank you.

147
00:18:54,977 --> 00:18:55,912
Thank you.

148
00:19:16,364 --> 00:19:17,299
He'll talk.

149
00:19:18,467 --> 00:19:21,536
No matter his
promises, it'll spread.

150
00:19:23,305 --> 00:19:24,841
That's how it works
with these people.

151
00:19:35,618 --> 00:19:36,551
Audrey?

152
00:19:37,887 --> 00:19:38,821
Audrey?

153
00:19:42,091 --> 00:19:43,025
Audrey?

154
00:19:44,359 --> 00:19:45,360
Audrey?

155
00:21:59,061 --> 00:22:00,596
Listen.

156
00:22:00,630 --> 00:22:02,198
I got you, Love.

157
00:22:11,539 --> 00:22:13,009
You're safe now.

158
00:22:13,042 --> 00:22:14,777
Come here.

159
00:22:14,810 --> 00:22:16,012
Now watch.

160
00:22:16,045 --> 00:22:16,979
You.

161
00:22:21,250 --> 00:22:22,184
Okay.

162
00:22:59,922 --> 00:23:00,923
Bridget, love.

163
00:23:03,960 --> 00:23:06,829
Bridget.

164
00:23:15,871 --> 00:23:17,239
Goodnight then.

165
00:23:29,251 --> 00:23:31,654
We must keep our voices low.

166
00:23:32,788 --> 00:23:34,957
My wife she's asleep upstairs.

167
00:23:34,991 --> 00:23:35,891
Your wife?

168
00:23:36,959 --> 00:23:38,127
Yeah.

169
00:23:38,160 --> 00:23:40,062
- Bridget.
- Bridget?

170
00:23:44,767 --> 00:23:45,668
What's your name?

171
00:23:46,936 --> 00:23:48,270
I'm Colm Dwyer.

172
00:23:50,039 --> 00:23:50,973
And you?

173
00:23:52,274 --> 00:23:53,209
Audrey.

174
00:23:54,276 --> 00:23:55,211
Audrey.

175
00:23:57,813 --> 00:23:59,982
What were you doing out there?

176
00:24:02,785 --> 00:24:03,686
Who's Liam?

177
00:24:06,022 --> 00:24:06,956
Our son.

178
00:24:13,129 --> 00:24:14,897
What age is he?

179
00:24:17,033 --> 00:24:17,967
He.

180
00:24:20,302 --> 00:24:21,237
Passed.

181
00:24:24,607 --> 00:24:25,775
What happened?

182
00:24:27,043 --> 00:24:27,977
Fell ill.

183
00:24:31,947 --> 00:24:33,616
It was his breathing.

184
00:24:35,951 --> 00:24:37,787
The funeral must
have been very hard for you.

185
00:24:39,288 --> 00:24:40,856
That's how we'll be known now,

186
00:24:43,225 --> 00:24:44,794
the parents who
lost their child.

187
00:24:47,797 --> 00:24:48,764
It'll be our legacy.

188
00:24:48,798 --> 00:24:49,698
Your legacy?

189
00:24:51,167 --> 00:24:53,669
Perhaps it's strange
for me to put it that way.

190
00:24:56,872 --> 00:24:59,742
Maybe not, I don't know.

191
00:24:59,775 --> 00:25:00,943
At least you
still have Bridget.

192
00:25:04,346 --> 00:25:06,315
I don't know what I'd
do if I lost her too.

193
00:25:10,252 --> 00:25:11,353
Why were you out there?

194
00:25:13,255 --> 00:25:15,024
Where'd you come from?

195
00:25:22,098 --> 00:25:23,666
Right.

196
00:25:23,699 --> 00:25:24,633
It's late.

197
00:25:27,236 --> 00:25:29,371
You can sleep there tonight.

198
00:25:35,010 --> 00:25:35,945
Colm.

199
00:25:37,113 --> 00:25:38,047
Yes.

200
00:25:47,690 --> 00:25:49,091
Thank you for letting me in.

201
00:25:57,900 --> 00:25:59,135
Goodnight then.

202
00:26:34,203 --> 00:26:35,137
Bridget.

203
00:26:40,776 --> 00:26:41,777
Bridget.

204
00:26:50,953 --> 00:26:51,887
Bridget.

205
00:27:01,330 --> 00:27:02,264
Bridget.

206
00:27:15,110 --> 00:27:16,045
Bridget.

207
00:27:21,517 --> 00:27:22,451
Bridget.

208
00:27:24,086 --> 00:27:25,020
Bridget.

209
00:27:26,088 --> 00:27:27,022
Bridget.

210
00:27:28,090 --> 00:27:29,024
Bridget.

211
00:27:30,092 --> 00:27:31,026
Bridget.

212
00:27:32,094 --> 00:27:33,329
Bridget.

213
00:27:33,362 --> 00:27:34,863
Bridget.

214
00:27:34,897 --> 00:27:35,831
Bridget.

215
00:27:37,333 --> 00:27:38,434
Bridget.

216
00:27:38,467 --> 00:27:39,535
Bridget.

217
00:27:39,568 --> 00:27:40,869
Bridget.

218
00:27:40,903 --> 00:27:42,204
Bridget.

219
00:27:42,238 --> 00:27:43,872
Bridget.

220
00:27:43,906 --> 00:27:45,074
Bridget.

221
00:27:45,107 --> 00:27:46,242
Bridget.

222
00:27:46,275 --> 00:27:47,476
Bridget.

223
00:27:47,509 --> 00:27:48,844
Bridget.

224
00:27:48,877 --> 00:27:49,945
Bridget.

225
00:28:55,044 --> 00:28:58,847
What the bloody
hell is wrong with her?

226
00:29:00,149 --> 00:29:02,418
And how
was she afterwards?

227
00:29:02,451 --> 00:29:05,487
Oh, she fell to sleep
once I had her back inside.

228
00:29:05,521 --> 00:29:06,955
You know how she is.

229
00:29:06,989 --> 00:29:08,524
She's always been
a tad agitated.

230
00:29:08,557 --> 00:29:09,858
Good morning.

231
00:29:09,892 --> 00:29:11,327
Bridget, love.

232
00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:13,362
Of course I've been agitated.

233
00:29:13,395 --> 00:29:14,863
He was our little boy.

234
00:29:16,298 --> 00:29:18,133
I'll step out for a moment.

235
00:29:23,906 --> 00:29:24,907
Why'd you do it?

236
00:29:29,646 --> 00:29:33,148
Why not ask Burke if you
wish to discuss my well being.

237
00:29:33,182 --> 00:29:34,483
I brought him here
to come and help you.

238
00:29:34,516 --> 00:29:36,218
You're not helping me!

239
00:29:36,251 --> 00:29:37,286
It wasn't normal what you...

240
00:29:40,089 --> 00:29:41,056
God.

241
00:29:42,257 --> 00:29:43,192
Bridget?

242
00:29:44,993 --> 00:29:45,928
Okay?

243
00:29:48,230 --> 00:29:49,398
Eh, Burke!

244
00:29:49,431 --> 00:29:50,366
Burke!

245
00:30:05,347 --> 00:30:06,348
Where were you?

246
00:30:06,382 --> 00:30:08,417
- Nowhere.
- Don't do that.

247
00:30:08,450 --> 00:30:09,686
We don't do that to each other.

248
00:30:09,719 --> 00:30:11,621
- What?
- Where did you go?

249
00:30:11,654 --> 00:30:12,655
I took a walk.

250
00:30:12,689 --> 00:30:13,922
To the Dwyer's house.

251
00:30:13,956 --> 00:30:14,957
What, no.

252
00:30:14,990 --> 00:30:16,024
I heard you yesterday.

253
00:30:16,058 --> 00:30:17,926
You spoke of him.

254
00:30:17,960 --> 00:30:20,129
I said you were attacked
and took it like a dog.

255
00:30:37,747 --> 00:30:39,616
How long have you
been feeling this way?

256
00:30:41,116 --> 00:30:42,585
Not long.

257
00:30:42,619 --> 00:30:44,319
And have you
noticed anything else

258
00:30:44,353 --> 00:30:45,921
that's at all out
of the ordinary?

259
00:30:48,591 --> 00:30:49,491
I don't believe so.

260
00:30:52,327 --> 00:30:54,396
I'm sure it's been a
difficult time for you both,

261
00:30:54,430 --> 00:30:56,365
so it does make sense
that you've missed this.

262
00:30:56,398 --> 00:30:57,332
But,

263
00:31:00,068 --> 00:31:01,403
you're with child.

264
00:31:01,437 --> 00:31:02,571
With child?

265
00:31:04,674 --> 00:31:06,375
It wasn't like this with Liam.

266
00:31:08,076 --> 00:31:09,344
It felt different.

267
00:31:10,512 --> 00:31:12,548
Every pregnancy is different.

268
00:31:12,582 --> 00:31:14,516
It's the reason for
your unusual cravings.

269
00:31:15,752 --> 00:31:17,419
Stick to proper food,

270
00:31:17,453 --> 00:31:20,456
and have a cup of tea if
you have any other urgings.

271
00:31:20,489 --> 00:31:24,126
But I'll come back in a week
or so, and we can talk more.

272
00:31:26,061 --> 00:31:26,962
I'll see myself out.

273
00:31:29,064 --> 00:31:29,965
Goodbye, Burke.

274
00:31:33,302 --> 00:31:34,236
I mean it.

275
00:31:36,104 --> 00:31:38,040
Something feels off.

276
00:31:38,073 --> 00:31:39,975
That's
just shock of it all.

277
00:31:41,477 --> 00:31:42,544
We'll take it day-by-day.

278
00:31:43,646 --> 00:31:44,647
Come here, Love.

279
00:31:46,515 --> 00:31:47,549
It'll be okay.

280
00:31:49,384 --> 00:31:50,620
It'll be okay.

281
00:32:09,238 --> 00:32:10,138
This one's done.

282
00:32:16,311 --> 00:32:17,446
What do you see out there?

283
00:32:19,682 --> 00:32:20,683
It's getting colder.

284
00:32:22,785 --> 00:32:24,587
All the more reason
for us to make haste.

285
00:32:26,221 --> 00:32:27,523
Hand me another.

286
00:32:34,631 --> 00:32:35,798
Christ, Audrey!

287
00:32:44,339 --> 00:32:46,676
I know it's all been
for my protection,

288
00:32:46,709 --> 00:32:47,710
everything you've done.

289
00:32:49,579 --> 00:32:50,479
I've tried.

290
00:32:52,414 --> 00:32:54,082
I know.

291
00:32:54,116 --> 00:32:55,484
But you need to
trust me now too.

292
00:32:57,252 --> 00:32:58,253
I'm ready.

293
00:33:00,289 --> 00:33:01,691
If that's the case,
then you'll understand

294
00:33:01,724 --> 00:33:03,525
the importance of sacrifice.

295
00:33:07,664 --> 00:33:08,564
Let me see.

296
00:33:10,432 --> 00:33:11,433
Mm.

297
00:33:16,706 --> 00:33:17,640
No.

298
00:33:32,755 --> 00:33:34,489
What happened here?

299
00:33:34,523 --> 00:33:36,626
I cannot say for certain.

300
00:33:42,732 --> 00:33:43,800
Fettered from the inside.

301
00:33:47,202 --> 00:33:48,705
It's not good.

302
00:33:48,738 --> 00:33:49,772
It's not good.

303
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:55,243
Yeah, Lochlan's horses he's
sentimental about these things.

304
00:33:55,277 --> 00:33:57,512
They're not supposed
to cross species.

305
00:33:59,649 --> 00:34:01,383
How's our girl keeping?

306
00:34:01,416 --> 00:34:02,885
Oh, she's good, she's healthy.

307
00:34:07,857 --> 00:34:09,424
Aren't you girl?

308
00:34:10,893 --> 00:34:14,396
You best keep her separate
till the slaughter.

309
00:34:14,429 --> 00:34:15,364
Mm.

310
00:34:29,712 --> 00:34:30,713
What, what's wrong?

311
00:34:30,747 --> 00:34:31,914
- Perfectly good.
- No good.

312
00:34:33,248 --> 00:34:34,249
No good.

313
00:34:53,936 --> 00:34:57,439
Bless us, O' Lord,
with these thy gifts

314
00:34:57,472 --> 00:35:01,476
which we're about to
receive from thy bounty

315
00:35:02,612 --> 00:35:05,247
through Christ, our Lord, amen.

316
00:35:06,314 --> 00:35:07,249
Amen.

317
00:35:09,551 --> 00:35:10,485
Amen.

318
00:35:17,392 --> 00:35:19,361
Where did this come from?

319
00:35:21,363 --> 00:35:23,565
Eat up before it gets cold.

320
00:35:27,436 --> 00:35:28,370
Mm.

321
00:35:39,582 --> 00:35:40,515
Mm-mm.

322
00:36:13,750 --> 00:36:14,684
Mm.

323
00:36:34,402 --> 00:36:35,705
Come now, Mauve.

324
00:36:54,123 --> 00:36:55,057
Is everything all right?

325
00:36:55,091 --> 00:36:56,626
What?

326
00:36:56,659 --> 00:36:57,593
No, no.

327
00:37:00,428 --> 00:37:01,329
What is it?

328
00:37:02,899 --> 00:37:04,533
I know Bernard better
than he knows himself.

329
00:37:04,566 --> 00:37:05,635
There's something wrong.

330
00:37:07,136 --> 00:37:08,570
Ten days ago now he came home

331
00:37:08,604 --> 00:37:09,972
with some fresh milk and bread.

332
00:37:10,006 --> 00:37:11,107
Where would he get that from?

333
00:37:11,140 --> 00:37:12,041
He wouldn't say
where he'd found it.

334
00:37:12,074 --> 00:37:13,009
That can't be all.

335
00:37:16,012 --> 00:37:18,413
He's been fondling himself.

336
00:37:18,446 --> 00:37:19,481
I caught him in the act.

337
00:37:21,416 --> 00:37:24,486
There's something
wrong with him.

338
00:37:24,519 --> 00:37:26,088
This deep sadness
I can't help him.

339
00:37:26,122 --> 00:37:27,455
Please, Seamus.

340
00:37:31,627 --> 00:37:32,995
Give us a minute.

341
00:37:44,106 --> 00:37:45,041
May I?

342
00:37:49,045 --> 00:37:50,780
It's not as she
tells it, not at all.

343
00:37:53,850 --> 00:37:56,586
Why don't you take
it from the beginning.

344
00:37:56,619 --> 00:37:57,552
What brought this on.

345
00:38:00,488 --> 00:38:02,959
Well, you remember
how Claudia Baron died?

346
00:38:02,992 --> 00:38:06,829
How she grew so sick
and with the nightmares,

347
00:38:06,863 --> 00:38:08,898
and she blamed it
on Agatha Earnshaw.

348
00:38:08,931 --> 00:38:10,099
Of course.

349
00:38:10,132 --> 00:38:12,702
That she had a
daughter, Agatha did,

350
00:38:12,735 --> 00:38:14,737
a daughter that no one
had ever seen before.

351
00:38:14,770 --> 00:38:16,571
I questioned Agatha myself.

352
00:38:17,940 --> 00:38:22,044
That poor girl
withered away terrified,

353
00:38:22,078 --> 00:38:24,113
and not one soul
of us believed her.

354
00:38:24,146 --> 00:38:25,081
Well, I do.

355
00:38:26,148 --> 00:38:27,083
I do.

356
00:38:28,885 --> 00:38:31,486
Well, no, don't tell
Deirdre for God sake.

357
00:38:31,519 --> 00:38:32,420
Promise me that.

358
00:38:34,522 --> 00:38:35,825
What happened, exactly?

359
00:38:37,093 --> 00:38:39,862
Well, I was coming
home from a job,

360
00:38:39,896 --> 00:38:42,965
and it was the day
after Liam's funeral.

361
00:38:44,100 --> 00:38:46,035
And I passed them on the road.

362
00:38:46,068 --> 00:38:47,603
And I had words with Agatha.

363
00:38:48,838 --> 00:38:51,473
And then I seen her.

364
00:38:51,506 --> 00:38:52,942
I seen her.

365
00:38:52,975 --> 00:38:54,143
She could have
been an acquaintance?

366
00:38:54,176 --> 00:38:56,579
It was her
daughter I know that.

367
00:38:56,612 --> 00:38:58,446
I know that from the
moment I saw her,

368
00:38:58,480 --> 00:39:00,216
and from that same moment
when she looked at me,

369
00:39:00,249 --> 00:39:02,450
I had a feeling that
I never had before.

370
00:39:03,819 --> 00:39:05,621
Suddenly empty.

371
00:39:08,090 --> 00:39:09,557
What are you saying?

372
00:39:09,592 --> 00:39:14,130
I don't think I can
go on living like I was.

373
00:39:16,799 --> 00:39:17,733
Not now.

374
00:39:20,069 --> 00:39:23,839
She was the most
beautiful creature

375
00:39:23,873 --> 00:39:25,608
I've ever laid eyes upon.

376
00:39:31,647 --> 00:39:32,882
It's just the wind.

377
00:39:36,218 --> 00:39:37,153
Yes.

378
00:39:41,958 --> 00:39:44,593
What would
you do if he came back?

379
00:39:44,627 --> 00:39:46,528
Well,
I'd protect you.

380
00:39:46,561 --> 00:39:48,631
But what if it was the
Dwyer man from the funeral?

381
00:39:48,664 --> 00:39:50,199
Oh, that
wouldn't change anything.

382
00:39:50,232 --> 00:39:52,768
- But at the funeral...
- That was different.

383
00:39:52,802 --> 00:39:53,803
There was a crowd.

384
00:39:53,836 --> 00:39:54,704
You were in the cart.

385
00:40:02,712 --> 00:40:03,746
What's you legacy?

386
00:40:06,048 --> 00:40:07,650
Well, I'd say you are.

387
00:40:10,186 --> 00:40:11,954
Is one's legacy
always their child?

388
00:40:13,656 --> 00:40:15,091
No, sometimes it can be

389
00:40:15,124 --> 00:40:16,826
if someone does
something important.

390
00:40:21,263 --> 00:40:24,200
Then perhaps one's legacy
is how people remember you.

391
00:40:24,233 --> 00:40:25,567
Possibly, yes.

392
00:40:28,337 --> 00:40:29,939
And that could mean sacrifice?

393
00:40:31,007 --> 00:40:31,941
Maybe.

394
00:40:34,610 --> 00:40:36,746
Does that mean you'd
sacrifice yourself for me?

395
00:41:02,271 --> 00:41:03,973
What?

396
00:41:04,006 --> 00:41:06,075
- What have you done?
- Nothing.

397
00:41:06,108 --> 00:41:07,643
- What have you done?
- Nothing.

398
00:41:07,676 --> 00:41:08,911
- What have you done?
- Nothing.

399
00:41:09,979 --> 00:41:11,313
Get in!

400
00:41:17,019 --> 00:41:19,055
No, let me out!

401
00:41:20,289 --> 00:41:21,724
Get me out!

402
00:41:21,757 --> 00:41:23,759
I want out!

403
00:41:49,819 --> 00:41:50,753
Hello?

404
00:41:56,058 --> 00:41:56,992
Lochlan?

405
00:41:59,228 --> 00:42:00,162
Mary?

406
00:42:10,906 --> 00:42:11,841
Hello?

407
00:42:12,908 --> 00:42:13,909
Hello?

408
00:42:20,249 --> 00:42:21,183
God.

409
00:43:22,778 --> 00:43:23,946
We need to talk.

410
00:43:26,348 --> 00:43:29,251
We need to speak, Seamus.

411
00:43:31,120 --> 00:43:33,322
We need to have words.

412
00:43:35,491 --> 00:43:36,859
It's not normal.

413
00:43:38,761 --> 00:43:39,929
It's not normal.

414
00:43:45,968 --> 00:43:47,736
One, two good luck..

415
00:43:50,339 --> 00:43:53,175
We're going to be late.

416
00:43:53,209 --> 00:43:54,243
I'm coming!

417
00:44:05,120 --> 00:44:09,892
♪ Savior from all of our fears ♪

418
00:44:14,797 --> 00:44:19,401
♪ May angels guard
us while we sleep ♪

419
00:44:22,471 --> 00:44:26,141
♪ Till morning light appears ♪

420
00:44:34,383 --> 00:44:35,251
You may be seated.

421
00:44:40,189 --> 00:44:42,091
Before we get to today's sermon,

422
00:44:43,892 --> 00:44:45,227
I'd like to make
an announcement.

423
00:44:47,363 --> 00:44:50,232
Colm and Bridget are
expecting a child.

424
00:44:57,273 --> 00:45:01,010
I thought we should start with
a short verse from I John,

425
00:45:01,043 --> 00:45:03,178
chapter four verse one.

426
00:45:03,212 --> 00:45:07,349
"We love because
he first loved us."

427
00:45:07,383 --> 00:45:09,118
Short and simple,

428
00:45:09,151 --> 00:45:10,886
- but perhaps something...
- That's enough!

429
00:45:12,354 --> 00:45:14,089
How?

430
00:45:14,123 --> 00:45:15,424
How can you keep
saying these things

431
00:45:15,457 --> 00:45:17,326
and maintain a straight face?

432
00:45:17,359 --> 00:45:19,094
- Pardon me?
- We love.

433
00:45:19,128 --> 00:45:21,397
We love because
God loved us first.

434
00:45:21,430 --> 00:45:22,364
Is that it?

435
00:45:23,465 --> 00:45:24,900
It's not merely a lie.

436
00:45:24,933 --> 00:45:26,603
It's a great load of horse shit.

437
00:45:26,636 --> 00:45:27,936
You best
mind that language.

438
00:45:27,970 --> 00:45:29,571
No, no we're gonna
talk right now!

439
00:45:30,939 --> 00:45:33,108
Failed crops, sickly children,

440
00:45:34,443 --> 00:45:37,513
how much graver must
our circumstance become?

441
00:45:37,546 --> 00:45:41,517
A calf was born with
two bloody heads,

442
00:45:41,550 --> 00:45:45,054
and not one person
uttered a word.

443
00:45:45,087 --> 00:45:48,591
We're bedeviled by something
unnatural out there.

444
00:45:48,625 --> 00:45:50,926
And what are we doing?

445
00:45:52,061 --> 00:45:52,961
It's not normal.

446
00:45:54,063 --> 00:45:55,197
This is not normal!

447
00:45:55,230 --> 00:45:57,399
I'm well aware of how perverse

448
00:45:57,433 --> 00:46:00,202
- these tragedies have become!
- These tragedy is

449
00:46:00,235 --> 00:46:02,338
that we've become so complacent.

450
00:46:02,371 --> 00:46:04,139
We just bend over and take it.

451
00:46:04,173 --> 00:46:06,241
There's a
difference between complacency,

452
00:46:06,275 --> 00:46:07,543
and maintaining one's faith...

453
00:46:07,576 --> 00:46:09,111
- Faith!
- in the face of...

454
00:46:09,144 --> 00:46:10,479
This is not about faith!

455
00:46:12,348 --> 00:46:13,148
Bernard, what's going on?

456
00:46:13,182 --> 00:46:15,652
- Shut up!
- Put it down, Bernard.

457
00:46:15,685 --> 00:46:18,854
I only wish you knew
what I felt with her.

458
00:46:20,089 --> 00:46:21,890
I truly do.

459
00:46:21,924 --> 00:46:25,394
It's a strange comfort to know

460
00:46:25,427 --> 00:46:28,997
how truly insignificant you are.

461
00:46:29,031 --> 00:46:30,966
- We can talk.
- Bernard, stop.

462
00:46:32,134 --> 00:46:34,036
Let's step outside.

463
00:46:34,069 --> 00:46:36,171
- No, no!
- No, no, no, no, no, don't!

464
00:47:15,577 --> 00:47:17,146
What do you want?

465
00:47:20,683 --> 00:47:22,484
I can't be seen.

466
00:47:22,518 --> 00:47:23,419
Get inside.

467
00:47:51,447 --> 00:47:52,414
Hello?

468
00:47:53,750 --> 00:47:55,017
Anybody in there?

469
00:47:59,656 --> 00:48:01,423
What
happened to your family?

470
00:48:05,662 --> 00:48:07,329
We just couldn't
survive anymore.

471
00:48:09,431 --> 00:48:10,365
I had to do it.

472
00:48:16,238 --> 00:48:17,139
How do you do it?

473
00:48:18,207 --> 00:48:19,709
Do what?

474
00:48:19,742 --> 00:48:22,144
You have the only farm
producing for miles.

475
00:48:23,780 --> 00:48:25,481
I don't know.

476
00:48:25,514 --> 00:48:26,716
That's not what I've heard.

477
00:48:28,116 --> 00:48:29,418
What have you heard?

478
00:48:31,220 --> 00:48:32,689
They think it's
your heathen ways.

479
00:48:34,223 --> 00:48:36,158
A pact with the devil
for all that out there.

480
00:48:38,828 --> 00:48:40,429
Silly superstitions, I suppose.

481
00:48:45,200 --> 00:48:46,603
All ye had to do was
help me that day,

482
00:48:46,636 --> 00:48:47,704
and they'd still be here.

483
00:48:49,438 --> 00:48:51,039
I know you chose to insult me.

484
00:48:52,541 --> 00:48:53,710
I'm sorry.

485
00:48:53,743 --> 00:48:55,678
You knew
I was desperate.

486
00:48:57,446 --> 00:48:58,514
I don't want any trouble.

487
00:49:00,249 --> 00:49:01,183
Don't speak.

488
00:49:04,854 --> 00:49:08,557
Now I'm gonna take as much
as I can carry then leave.

489
00:49:08,591 --> 00:49:10,526
If you mention this to anyone,
I'll come back for you.

490
00:49:10,559 --> 00:49:13,095
I swear to fucking God I will.

491
00:49:13,128 --> 00:49:14,029
Do you understand?

492
00:49:18,300 --> 00:49:19,234
Very good.

493
00:49:20,302 --> 00:49:21,470
Very good.

494
00:49:50,465 --> 00:49:51,834
We can handle this.

495
00:49:51,868 --> 00:49:53,302
Well, I
could've handled it myself.

496
00:49:53,335 --> 00:49:54,804
He had you against the wall!

497
00:49:54,837 --> 00:49:56,305
He was a villain
just like you've said

498
00:49:56,338 --> 00:49:57,607
- about everyone!
- That's enough!

499
00:49:57,640 --> 00:49:58,875
They think you're weak.

500
00:49:58,908 --> 00:50:00,342
- And they're right!
- Watch your mouth!

501
00:50:04,781 --> 00:50:06,548
They will come looking for him,

502
00:50:06,583 --> 00:50:08,383
and sooner or later
they will find him.

503
00:50:10,485 --> 00:50:11,386
I saved your life.

504
00:50:15,758 --> 00:50:18,661
I was a fool to
think I could be the mother.

505
00:50:20,295 --> 00:50:21,229
Come on.

506
00:51:12,649 --> 00:51:14,282
What's wrong?

507
00:51:14,316 --> 00:51:15,818
Look.

508
00:51:15,852 --> 00:51:17,419
When'd that happen?

509
00:51:17,452 --> 00:51:18,821
I was brushing my teeth.

510
00:51:18,855 --> 00:51:20,690
- Let me see.
- No.

511
00:51:20,723 --> 00:51:21,858
- Come on let me see.
- No!

512
00:51:23,325 --> 00:51:24,694
I need to tell you something.

513
00:51:28,865 --> 00:51:30,399
I can't have this baby.

514
00:51:31,466 --> 00:51:32,501
What?

515
00:51:34,269 --> 00:51:36,606
There are ways to end a pregnancy
before it comes to term.

516
00:51:38,440 --> 00:51:39,909
Remedies and such.

517
00:51:39,942 --> 00:51:40,943
There's no way!

518
00:51:40,977 --> 00:51:42,544
You want to kill our child!

519
00:51:42,577 --> 00:51:43,680
- Colm.
- I won't allow it.

520
00:51:43,713 --> 00:51:44,714
- Colm, wait!
- I won't allow it!

521
00:51:44,747 --> 00:51:45,682
Wait!

522
00:51:46,783 --> 00:51:47,684
Colm, wait.

523
00:51:48,951 --> 00:51:49,986
No wait.

524
00:51:50,019 --> 00:51:52,454
Stop, listen to me I'm sorry.

525
00:51:52,487 --> 00:51:53,756
I wasn't aware.

526
00:51:53,790 --> 00:51:55,357
- You weren't aware!
- I wasn't aware!

527
00:51:55,390 --> 00:51:56,659
- Don't fucking touch me!
- I'm sorry please.

528
00:51:56,693 --> 00:51:58,795
You weren't aware
that I'd be disgusted

529
00:51:58,828 --> 00:52:01,229
by such a heinous proposal.

530
00:52:01,263 --> 00:52:03,331
The soil's not yet
settled on Liam's grave,

531
00:52:03,365 --> 00:52:04,801
and you're ready
to bury another!

532
00:52:04,834 --> 00:52:06,334
I'm sorry.

533
00:52:06,368 --> 00:52:07,302
- Don't touch me.
- Please don't go.

534
00:52:08,604 --> 00:52:09,605
Where are you going.

535
00:52:09,639 --> 00:52:10,907
Anywhere away from you.

536
00:52:10,940 --> 00:52:12,709
But you can't go, please.

537
00:52:12,742 --> 00:52:14,877
Please don't leave me.

538
00:52:14,911 --> 00:52:17,680
I can't be alone right now.

539
00:52:17,714 --> 00:52:18,648
Colm!

540
00:52:20,415 --> 00:52:21,684
Please!

541
00:53:13,936 --> 00:53:15,303
Come here, love.

542
00:53:37,492 --> 00:53:38,426
Deirdre.

543
00:53:49,939 --> 00:53:51,874
What did
Bernard say to you that day?

544
00:53:54,043 --> 00:53:55,778
- You know I can't.
- What was it?

545
00:53:57,680 --> 00:53:59,115
I just can't.

546
00:53:59,148 --> 00:54:00,783
Look something pushed
him over the edge,

547
00:54:00,817 --> 00:54:02,450
and I have a right to
know what that was.

548
00:54:02,484 --> 00:54:04,854
Look I understand
your confusion.

549
00:54:04,887 --> 00:54:06,454
Is there someone else?

550
00:54:06,488 --> 00:54:07,690
It wasn't anything like that.

551
00:54:07,723 --> 00:54:09,792
"What I felt with her,"

552
00:54:09,826 --> 00:54:11,961
he obviously wasn't
referring to me.

553
00:54:11,994 --> 00:54:13,729
Trust me, I'm working on it.

554
00:54:13,763 --> 00:54:15,497
Have you sent for help?

555
00:54:15,530 --> 00:54:17,432
There has to be
an investigation.

556
00:54:17,465 --> 00:54:19,534
- What help?
- From the cities.

557
00:54:19,568 --> 00:54:21,804
They can deduce his
reasoning with science.

558
00:54:21,838 --> 00:54:23,906
You know Bernard was
your brother-in-law.

559
00:54:23,940 --> 00:54:25,908
He's not just another
entry in your catalog.

560
00:54:27,576 --> 00:54:29,444
You want to know what
Bernard said to me?

561
00:54:34,016 --> 00:54:36,786
He claimed to have seen the
daughter of Agatha Earnshaw.

562
00:54:38,520 --> 00:54:39,789
What if he did?

563
00:54:39,822 --> 00:54:40,857
Have you spoken to Agatha?

564
00:54:40,890 --> 00:54:43,025
This requires tact.

565
00:54:43,059 --> 00:54:44,526
Bernard killed himself.

566
00:54:45,628 --> 00:54:46,596
Deirdre, please.

567
00:54:47,763 --> 00:54:49,765
Trust me to do the right thing.

568
00:54:49,799 --> 00:54:51,601
You'd better.

569
00:54:51,634 --> 00:54:53,669
We all deserve better than this.

570
00:54:53,703 --> 00:54:56,105
Bernard deserves
better than this.

571
00:55:41,918 --> 00:55:43,853
Hello, Agatha.

572
00:55:46,756 --> 00:55:48,691
May I come in?

573
00:55:48,724 --> 00:55:49,625
What's this about?

574
00:55:52,695 --> 00:55:53,796
It's important.

575
00:55:55,264 --> 00:55:56,165
I'll make it brief.

576
00:56:22,591 --> 00:56:23,491
What is it?

577
00:56:25,995 --> 00:56:27,129
I know it's strange,

578
00:56:28,864 --> 00:56:30,498
my being here.

579
00:56:30,532 --> 00:56:31,233
Yes.

580
00:56:34,670 --> 00:56:36,639
A man from my
congregation passed.

581
00:56:39,075 --> 00:56:40,176
It was a suicide.

582
00:56:41,744 --> 00:56:43,511
Oh.

583
00:56:43,545 --> 00:56:45,781
It happened during service
in front of everyone.

584
00:56:48,985 --> 00:56:51,053
He had come to me a few
weeks prior he said...

585
00:56:54,123 --> 00:56:56,558
He said he had seen
you and another,

586
00:56:59,962 --> 00:57:01,864
a girl he believed
to be your daughter.

587
00:57:01,897 --> 00:57:03,565
I've heard this rumor before.

588
00:57:03,599 --> 00:57:04,834
I remember,
but this is not...

589
00:57:04,867 --> 00:57:07,169
No, you don't get to
do this to me again.

590
00:57:07,203 --> 00:57:08,204
No.

591
00:57:09,672 --> 00:57:11,674
It's only due diligence
for his widow's sake.

592
00:57:12,808 --> 00:57:15,277
He referenced her, this girl,

593
00:57:15,311 --> 00:57:16,946
before he pulled the trigger.

594
00:57:16,979 --> 00:57:18,914
Your man was sick in the head.

595
00:57:18,948 --> 00:57:20,816
I will to be held accountable.

596
00:57:30,059 --> 00:57:31,293
Have you had another threat?

597
00:57:33,329 --> 00:57:34,630
Uh, no, why?

598
00:57:36,032 --> 00:57:36,966
There's another man.

599
00:57:38,067 --> 00:57:39,101
Poisoned his family.

600
00:57:40,236 --> 00:57:41,170
Just.

601
00:57:42,905 --> 00:57:44,572
Just be careful.

602
00:58:03,392 --> 00:58:04,860
Mr. Buckley killed himself.

603
00:58:06,962 --> 00:58:08,230
He saw something in you.

604
00:58:20,643 --> 00:58:21,343
Bridget.

605
00:58:23,913 --> 00:58:25,681
Bridget.

606
00:58:25,714 --> 00:58:26,816
Bridget, love.

607
00:58:26,849 --> 00:58:28,017
Bridget!

608
00:58:28,050 --> 00:58:29,218
Bridget, love.

609
00:58:29,251 --> 00:58:30,252
Bridget!

610
00:58:30,286 --> 00:58:31,220
Bridget.

611
00:58:41,831 --> 00:58:43,199
What are you doing?

612
00:58:45,401 --> 00:58:47,136
What are you doing?

613
00:58:49,805 --> 00:58:50,739
Shh.

614
00:58:51,974 --> 00:58:53,375
You'll wake him.

615
01:00:13,923 --> 01:00:14,924
What is this?

616
01:00:14,957 --> 01:00:15,858
We're leaving.

617
01:00:20,963 --> 01:00:22,298
I told you word would spread.

618
01:00:22,331 --> 01:00:23,899
Seamus wasn't
looking for the man.

619
01:00:23,933 --> 01:00:25,801
About you, Audrey.

620
01:00:25,834 --> 01:00:26,969
And, yes, sooner or later,

621
01:00:27,002 --> 01:00:27,937
they'll come looking
for the body.

622
01:00:27,970 --> 01:00:29,205
I can handle it if they do.

623
01:00:29,238 --> 01:00:30,973
It's too much.

624
01:00:31,006 --> 01:00:33,008
This is our home.

625
01:00:33,042 --> 01:00:34,877
We're going, at
least for a while.

626
01:00:39,782 --> 01:00:41,150
I'm not going anywhere.

627
01:00:47,156 --> 01:00:48,824
This isn't up for negotiation.

628
01:00:50,292 --> 01:00:51,193
Do you hear me?

629
01:00:58,434 --> 01:01:00,502
I can't believe
how weak you are!

630
01:01:00,536 --> 01:01:02,137
It's sickening!

631
01:01:02,171 --> 01:01:03,339
You'd let them walk all over you

632
01:01:03,372 --> 01:01:04,940
before standing your ground!

633
01:01:06,408 --> 01:01:08,077
What happened
to my sweet child?

634
01:01:09,545 --> 01:01:11,313
One of us has to do something.

635
01:01:38,907 --> 01:01:39,842
Audrey.

636
01:01:40,976 --> 01:01:42,311
Audrey, stop it?

637
01:01:42,344 --> 01:01:43,412
Stop it, that's enough.

638
01:01:43,445 --> 01:01:44,346
That's enough!

639
01:01:47,283 --> 01:01:48,317
You've made your point.

640
01:03:47,269 --> 01:03:48,270
Bridget!

641
01:03:51,573 --> 01:03:52,508
Bridget!

642
01:04:03,653 --> 01:04:04,587
Bridget?

643
01:04:11,628 --> 01:04:14,463
Bridget, what have you done?

644
01:04:14,496 --> 01:04:15,431
Huh?

645
01:04:21,403 --> 01:04:22,304
You didn't.

646
01:04:27,476 --> 01:04:29,044
What have you done?

647
01:04:30,212 --> 01:04:31,581
What have you done?

648
01:04:35,317 --> 01:04:36,218
Okay, okay.

649
01:04:52,067 --> 01:04:54,503
Just a wee while longer,

650
01:04:54,536 --> 01:04:55,437
and we'll be done.

651
01:04:57,072 --> 01:04:58,140
Will she be well?

652
01:04:58,173 --> 01:04:59,575
Yes,

653
01:04:59,609 --> 01:05:01,376
but she'll need
to be very careful

654
01:05:01,410 --> 01:05:02,679
while the stitches are in.

655
01:05:04,112 --> 01:05:05,013
And the child?

656
01:05:06,148 --> 01:05:07,282
She was very lucky.

657
01:05:24,233 --> 01:05:25,133
What's this?

658
01:05:26,468 --> 01:05:28,771
No, you don't have to do this.

659
01:05:28,805 --> 01:05:30,773
No, Burke, I swear I'll be
fine, no, don't do this.

660
01:05:30,807 --> 01:05:31,741
It's for your own good, Love.

661
01:05:31,774 --> 01:05:33,408
Colm, please don't.

662
01:05:33,442 --> 01:05:34,543
Promise I don't need this.

663
01:05:34,576 --> 01:05:36,746
Please, God, please don't.

664
01:05:36,779 --> 01:05:38,347
I'm sure it's for
your own good, Love.

665
01:05:38,380 --> 01:05:41,049
Colm, please don't
just stand there!

666
01:05:41,083 --> 01:05:43,252
I promise I don't
need this, Colm.

667
01:05:43,285 --> 01:05:45,588
It's only to calm
your nerves, Bridget.

668
01:05:45,622 --> 01:05:47,556
Please don't.

669
01:06:11,280 --> 01:06:12,815
Where are you going?

670
01:06:14,116 --> 01:06:15,050
To the others.

671
01:06:17,352 --> 01:06:19,054
They deserve to know
what's happened.

672
01:06:20,422 --> 01:06:22,157
At least they haven't
forgotten why I'm here.

673
01:06:28,898 --> 01:06:32,267
You'll need to keep here in
there for at least a few days.

674
01:06:35,404 --> 01:06:37,372
What the bloody hell
is wrong with her?

675
01:06:37,406 --> 01:06:38,307
I don't know.

676
01:06:39,474 --> 01:06:40,710
- Her temperature...
- That was not

677
01:06:40,743 --> 01:06:42,110
her temperature!

678
01:06:43,780 --> 01:06:45,715
She's gone stark-raving mad.

679
01:06:51,621 --> 01:06:53,422
Her heart is racing!

680
01:06:53,455 --> 01:06:54,356
Bridget, breathe!

681
01:06:56,258 --> 01:06:58,226
You need to calm down now!

682
01:07:21,784 --> 01:07:23,452
Well, think, damn you!

683
01:07:24,721 --> 01:07:25,788
That's not grieving
what she's done.

684
01:07:25,822 --> 01:07:27,590
What do you want me to say?

685
01:07:27,624 --> 01:07:28,925
She's been acting
strange for days

686
01:07:28,958 --> 01:07:30,760
since before we knew
she was carrying child.

687
01:07:30,793 --> 01:07:32,394
That's all I thought it was.

688
01:07:36,866 --> 01:07:38,433
Everything changed after Liam.

689
01:07:43,505 --> 01:07:45,474
It's been a rash of
awful business lately.

690
01:07:46,776 --> 01:07:47,710
Liam,

691
01:07:48,778 --> 01:07:49,712
now this,

692
01:07:50,847 --> 01:07:52,514
Lochlan and his family.

693
01:07:59,656 --> 01:08:00,590
Bernard.

694
01:08:02,424 --> 01:08:03,325
What about Bernard?

695
01:08:04,927 --> 01:08:06,596
You're not to utter
a word of this to anyone.

696
01:08:07,664 --> 01:08:08,965
Of course.

697
01:08:08,998 --> 01:08:11,199
He swore to me that he'd seen

698
01:08:11,233 --> 01:08:13,603
the daughter of Agatha Earnshaw.

699
01:08:16,304 --> 01:08:18,908
He passed them on the road
the day after Liam's funeral.

700
01:08:18,941 --> 01:08:19,876
After the funeral.

701
01:08:21,744 --> 01:08:24,346
He called her the most beautiful
creature he'd ever seen.

702
01:08:25,848 --> 01:08:26,783
I saw her too.

703
01:08:27,884 --> 01:08:29,284
I brought her here.

704
01:08:32,722 --> 01:08:36,793
I heard a scream, and then I
found her laying in the grass.

705
01:08:36,826 --> 01:08:38,293
Why didn't
you say something.

706
01:08:38,326 --> 01:08:40,562
I didn't say
anything to anyone.

707
01:08:40,596 --> 01:08:41,898
Not even Bridget I was so drunk.

708
01:08:41,931 --> 01:08:43,465
I hardly recall any of it.

709
01:08:47,804 --> 01:08:50,907
It all started after
that night, the sickness.

710
01:08:53,609 --> 01:08:54,777
She said her name was Audrey.

711
01:08:59,548 --> 01:09:01,283
Here.

712
01:09:01,316 --> 01:09:02,217
What's this.

713
01:09:03,586 --> 01:09:05,420
Every affliction
the village has seen.

714
01:09:07,790 --> 01:09:08,991
Oh, god.

715
01:09:10,760 --> 01:09:13,796
Everything can be traced
back to the eclipse 17 years.

716
01:09:15,497 --> 01:09:17,466
If Agatha's her mother,
then who's the father?

717
01:10:37,512 --> 01:10:38,614
God, help us.

718
01:11:14,016 --> 01:11:15,517
Why are you doing this?

719
01:11:19,121 --> 01:11:19,989
What's your purpose?

720
01:11:22,825 --> 01:11:24,160
My purpose?

721
01:11:24,193 --> 01:11:25,928
You've corrupted
my daughter-in-law.

722
01:11:27,797 --> 01:11:32,567
You've propelled a man from
my congregation to suicide.

723
01:11:37,106 --> 01:11:39,474
Why did your mother
keep you secret?

724
01:11:40,743 --> 01:11:41,677
Answer me.

725
01:11:52,188 --> 01:11:53,089
I need to understand.

726
01:11:55,758 --> 01:11:57,927
I could explain, but it's
easier if I just show you.

727
01:12:40,568 --> 01:12:41,503
No.

728
01:12:44,206 --> 01:12:45,141
I can't.

729
01:12:50,179 --> 01:12:51,080
You can.

730
01:13:56,612 --> 01:13:57,813
Hello, Agatha.

731
01:13:57,847 --> 01:13:59,815
You frightened
me half to death.

732
01:13:59,849 --> 01:14:01,951
Where are you running off to?

733
01:14:01,984 --> 01:14:03,686
I was coming to find you.

734
01:14:05,888 --> 01:14:08,657
What are you doing here?

735
01:14:08,691 --> 01:14:10,026
We're
going to go and see Audrey.

736
01:14:12,228 --> 01:14:13,295
I wasn't running away.

737
01:14:14,630 --> 01:14:16,132
That's not what I was doing.

738
01:14:16,165 --> 01:14:19,735
I know how hard
it can be to let go.

739
01:14:38,954 --> 01:14:40,189
Deirdre.

740
01:14:40,222 --> 01:14:41,957
What are you doing here?

741
01:14:41,991 --> 01:14:43,259
Of course, I'm here.

742
01:14:43,292 --> 01:14:44,894
Tonight's the?

743
01:14:44,927 --> 01:14:46,228
Eh?

744
01:14:46,262 --> 01:14:48,664
- Eh?
- It's the ingathering.

745
01:14:48,697 --> 01:14:49,832
Yes, exactly.

746
01:14:51,133 --> 01:14:52,802
Where were you
earlier before this?

747
01:14:52,835 --> 01:14:54,036
Home.

748
01:14:54,070 --> 01:14:55,704
What?

749
01:14:55,738 --> 01:14:57,139
You mean you weren't out there?

750
01:14:57,173 --> 01:14:58,941
No.

751
01:14:58,974 --> 01:15:00,076
Let me take your coat.

752
01:15:02,344 --> 01:15:04,280
No, it's fine I'll
keep it, it's cold.

753
01:15:17,760 --> 01:15:19,662
This will be over soon.

754
01:15:21,363 --> 01:15:22,298
I promise.

755
01:15:46,922 --> 01:15:47,923
We are pilgrims,

756
01:15:49,792 --> 01:15:51,327
absolute in our conviction.

757
01:15:54,864 --> 01:15:57,666
We endure ridicule from
our fellow countrymen.

758
01:15:58,801 --> 01:16:01,904
Persecution even for our loyalty

759
01:16:01,937 --> 01:16:03,339
to the rights of
our forefathers.

760
01:16:06,442 --> 01:16:08,144
But we know this is your will

761
01:16:10,412 --> 01:16:14,116
that our standard is
the most righteous path.

762
01:16:16,085 --> 01:16:17,820
God makes the sun rise and set.

763
01:16:19,388 --> 01:16:20,322
And is faithful

764
01:16:20,356 --> 01:16:22,992
from generation to generation.

765
01:16:23,025 --> 01:16:26,095
God makes summer and
winter come and go.

766
01:16:26,128 --> 01:16:27,062
DEIRDRE AND
COLM: He is faithful

767
01:16:27,096 --> 01:16:29,832
from generation to generation

768
01:16:29,865 --> 01:16:33,836
God makes the plants
grow and flowers bloom.

769
01:16:33,869 --> 01:16:34,803
DEIRDRE AND
COLM: He is faithful

770
01:16:34,837 --> 01:16:37,406
from generation to generation.

771
01:16:37,439 --> 01:16:38,874
God gives us...

772
01:16:42,878 --> 01:16:43,812
Um?

773
01:16:47,183 --> 01:16:48,284
He grants us...

774
01:16:51,453 --> 01:16:52,388
No.

775
01:16:54,023 --> 01:16:54,957
God gives.

776
01:17:01,897 --> 01:17:05,167
God gives us food to
eat and people to love.

777
01:17:05,201 --> 01:17:08,470
He is faithful from
generation to generation.

778
01:17:08,504 --> 01:17:10,306
God is always with us.

779
01:17:12,041 --> 01:17:12,975
DEIRDRE AND
SEAMUS: He's faithful

780
01:17:13,008 --> 01:17:15,277
from generation to generation.

781
01:17:16,378 --> 01:17:17,446
Oh, Lord God,

782
01:17:18,547 --> 01:17:19,882
Father of all mercies,

783
01:17:22,117 --> 01:17:24,920
We yield thee praise and
thanksgiving for our deliverance

784
01:17:24,954 --> 01:17:26,288
from those great
and apparent dangers

785
01:17:26,322 --> 01:17:27,723
wherewith we were compassed.

786
01:17:30,492 --> 01:17:32,895
Please deliver my Bridget
from this sickness.

787
01:17:35,030 --> 01:17:36,999
Spare this famine
from another death

788
01:17:37,032 --> 01:17:38,167
through Christ, our Lord.

789
01:17:45,574 --> 01:17:46,775
Bridget.

790
01:17:46,809 --> 01:17:48,010
Bridget, Bridget.

791
01:17:48,043 --> 01:17:49,044
Bridget.

792
01:17:49,078 --> 01:17:50,479
Hey, hey, hey!

793
01:17:50,512 --> 01:17:51,447
Come on.

794
01:17:53,949 --> 01:17:54,883
Hey.

795
01:17:56,018 --> 01:17:56,885
Bridget, don't do this.

796
01:17:59,054 --> 01:18:00,222
Listen, listen to
me, listen to me.

797
01:18:00,256 --> 01:18:03,092
I'm sorry for how things
were after Liam, okay.

798
01:18:03,125 --> 01:18:05,494
Okay, I know I could
be a better husband.

799
01:18:13,535 --> 01:18:14,470
Bridget.

800
01:18:18,274 --> 01:18:20,209
Please, Love, please
don't leave me too.

801
01:18:23,112 --> 01:18:25,247
Don't
die on me please.

802
01:18:25,281 --> 01:18:26,215
I need you.

803
01:18:29,051 --> 01:18:29,985
Please.

804
01:18:33,623 --> 01:18:35,057
Should we go check on them?

805
01:18:37,459 --> 01:18:39,028
He'll
need some space.

806
01:18:40,362 --> 01:18:42,164
What about Bridget?

807
01:18:42,197 --> 01:18:44,833
- No.
- What?

808
01:18:44,867 --> 01:18:46,468
We should prepare
for the worst.

809
01:18:46,502 --> 01:18:48,037
What has gotten into you?

810
01:18:49,538 --> 01:18:51,340
You couldn't recall
the prayers earlier.

811
01:18:53,242 --> 01:18:56,312
We've all been under a tremendous
amount of stress lately.

812
01:18:56,345 --> 01:18:58,847
No, Dad, that's not it.

813
01:18:58,881 --> 01:18:59,848
Not for you.

814
01:19:00,916 --> 01:19:01,884
What are you suggesting?

815
01:19:01,917 --> 01:19:03,485
I saw you earlier.

816
01:19:04,621 --> 01:19:06,121
You were with the Earnshaw girl.

817
01:19:09,158 --> 01:19:12,294
That, that belonged to Lochlan.

818
01:19:12,328 --> 01:19:14,530
They stashed his body in
the fucking wood shed.

819
01:19:36,385 --> 01:19:38,354
Why were you with her?

820
01:19:38,387 --> 01:19:40,289
She appeared before me.

821
01:19:40,322 --> 01:19:42,391
Do you know what
happened to Bernard?

822
01:19:42,424 --> 01:19:43,359
Yes.

823
01:19:47,529 --> 01:19:49,031
I know only too well.

824
01:19:51,100 --> 01:19:52,635
Colm!

825
01:19:52,669 --> 01:19:54,169
Colm, get down here immediately!

826
01:19:55,471 --> 01:19:56,639
Colm!

827
01:20:07,182 --> 01:20:08,585
- What happened?
- Look at him.

828
01:20:10,386 --> 01:20:11,387
What, what is it?

829
01:20:11,420 --> 01:20:12,421
He was with the Earnshaw girl.

830
01:20:14,256 --> 01:20:15,224
She was here?

831
01:20:15,257 --> 01:20:16,593
I saw them both together.

832
01:20:18,060 --> 01:20:19,294
Hand me the gun.

833
01:20:19,328 --> 01:20:20,663
Something's wrong, believe me.

834
01:20:20,697 --> 01:20:21,631
Deirdre?

835
01:20:22,965 --> 01:20:24,533
The Earnshaws killed Lochlan.

836
01:20:24,566 --> 01:20:26,068
She's right.

837
01:20:26,101 --> 01:20:28,671
- Look at him.
- Give me bloody gun.

838
01:20:28,705 --> 01:20:30,239
Deirdre's right.

839
01:20:30,272 --> 01:20:31,540
She's here.

840
01:20:31,573 --> 01:20:32,975
What?

841
01:20:33,008 --> 01:20:34,276
She's here.

842
01:20:34,309 --> 01:20:35,277
Audrey.

843
01:20:54,563 --> 01:20:56,198
Bridget's gone.

844
01:20:56,231 --> 01:20:57,566
And I need to die too.

845
01:20:57,600 --> 01:20:58,701
What are you saying?

846
01:20:58,735 --> 01:21:00,135
We'll find Audrey!

847
01:21:00,169 --> 01:21:01,170
We'll settle this!

848
01:21:01,203 --> 01:21:03,005
Just fucking do it!

849
01:21:03,038 --> 01:21:04,339
I can't bear it!

850
01:21:04,373 --> 01:21:05,541
I can't bear it one fucking...

851
01:21:19,054 --> 01:21:20,623
What have you done?

852
01:21:20,657 --> 01:21:22,458
- What have you done, you?
- I don't know.

853
01:21:22,491 --> 01:21:23,626
Fucking fool!

854
01:21:50,620 --> 01:21:52,722
I brought you into our home!

855
01:21:52,755 --> 01:21:54,691
I took care of you, why?

856
01:21:54,724 --> 01:21:56,425
What did we do to deserve this?

857
01:21:56,458 --> 01:21:58,126
I was in the cart the day
you threatened my mother.

858
01:21:58,160 --> 01:21:59,428
What did she do to deserve that?

859
01:21:59,461 --> 01:22:00,562
It was my son's funeral.

860
01:22:10,740 --> 01:22:13,776
What is it?

861
01:22:13,810 --> 01:22:18,715
What is this?

862
01:22:34,096 --> 01:22:36,298
Do you know how many
girls died trying?

863
01:22:39,836 --> 01:22:41,236
I carry you to term.

864
01:22:44,641 --> 01:22:45,541
They'll tell you.

865
01:22:48,410 --> 01:22:49,612
The jealousy was so awful.

866
01:22:50,747 --> 01:22:52,682
They weren't so strong.

867
01:22:52,715 --> 01:22:54,283
They couldn't do what I did.

868
01:23:07,329 --> 01:23:08,363
Say something.

869
01:23:14,169 --> 01:23:15,103
Thank you.

870
01:23:35,157 --> 01:23:37,125
No, goddamn you, Audrey!

871
01:23:37,159 --> 01:23:38,527
No!

872
01:23:38,560 --> 01:23:39,596
Please no!

873
01:23:44,266 --> 01:23:45,500
Do you enjoy the struggle?

874
01:23:47,737 --> 01:23:49,806
Pouring sweat over fields
that'll never sprout.

875
01:23:51,941 --> 01:23:55,143
No, please don't do this.

876
01:23:55,177 --> 01:23:57,312
- Anything you want.
- Please.

877
01:23:57,346 --> 01:23:59,548
Anything it's yours.

878
01:24:01,584 --> 01:24:02,652
I promise you.

879
01:24:02,685 --> 01:24:07,389
Don't do this.

880
01:24:08,490 --> 01:24:09,391
Who's the father?

881
01:24:16,899 --> 01:24:17,767
There's no father.

882
01:24:21,370 --> 01:24:22,371
I'm still a virgin.

883
01:24:38,655 --> 01:24:39,956
No, please.

884
01:24:39,989 --> 01:24:41,658
Please have mercy on me!

885
01:24:41,691 --> 01:24:42,892
Don't do this!

886
01:24:42,925 --> 01:24:44,192
No!

887
01:24:44,226 --> 01:24:45,260
No, no, don't!

888
01:24:46,361 --> 01:24:50,365
No.

889
01:24:52,401 --> 01:24:53,335
Please no.

890
01:24:54,403 --> 01:24:55,337
No, no!

891
01:24:56,438 --> 01:24:57,907
No, no!

892
01:24:57,940 --> 01:24:59,441
Please, no!

893
01:24:59,474 --> 01:25:02,244
I beg you please don't do this!

894
01:25:02,277 --> 01:25:03,245
No!

895
01:25:04,312 --> 01:25:05,313
No.

896
01:25:05,347 --> 01:25:06,949
No, no, please!

897
01:25:06,983 --> 01:25:08,685
Please don't do this.

898
01:25:17,526 --> 01:25:19,662
He's faithful from
generation to generation.

899
01:25:19,696 --> 01:25:20,630
No, please.

900
01:28:33,789 --> 01:28:34,724
Colm.

901
01:28:36,626 --> 01:28:37,760
It's coming.

902
01:28:46,969 --> 01:28:48,871
- One last push.
- Come on.

903
01:28:48,905 --> 01:28:50,505
- Push.
- Come on.

904
01:28:50,538 --> 01:28:51,573
Come on, Love.

905
01:29:14,163 --> 01:29:15,097
What is it?

906
01:29:16,832 --> 01:29:18,466
Boy or girl?

907
01:29:18,500 --> 01:29:20,535
Come on what is it?

908
01:29:20,568 --> 01:29:23,172
- Oh, god.
- What's wrong?

909
01:29:23,205 --> 01:29:24,173
What's wrong?

910
01:29:26,042 --> 01:29:27,109
Christ.

911
01:29:27,143 --> 01:29:29,745
What, what's wrong?

912
01:29:29,779 --> 01:29:30,713
No, no.

913
01:29:32,214 --> 01:29:33,816
- What's happening?
- Don't look!

914
01:29:45,861 --> 01:29:47,495
Kill it!

915
01:29:57,139 --> 01:29:58,908
Colm, please come back!

916
01:30:02,577 --> 01:30:03,511
Kill it!
