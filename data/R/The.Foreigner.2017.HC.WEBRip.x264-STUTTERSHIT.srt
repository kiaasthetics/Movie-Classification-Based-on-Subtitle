00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:13,000
LONDON

3
00:01:13,100 --> 00:01:14,600
- You like it?
- All right.

4
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:16,100
I need to go. My dad's here.

5
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:17,800
- I'll see you soon.
- Yeah.

6
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:27,200
This is the dress.
Do you like it?

7
00:01:27,300 --> 00:01:30,800
We've got to hurry. Everyone's going.
There's only two left in my size.

8
00:01:32,889 --> 00:01:35,100
Come on, Dad, let's go.

9
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:43,300
- When do I meet him?
- His name's Chappy.

10
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:45,600
- On the football team and very--
- Chubby?

11
00:01:45,700 --> 00:01:47,100
Chappy.

12
00:01:47,300 --> 00:01:49,600
You'll meet when he picks me up
for the dance.

13
00:01:49,700 --> 00:01:53,000
- Not before?
- Dad, you really need to go faster.

14
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:59,400
- Will he drive you to the dance?
- He's rented a limo.

15
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:01,300
So he won't drive you?

16
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:05,300
Limos come with drivers.
So stop worrying.

17
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:14,900
It's a nice dress.
You'll be very pretty.

18
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,800
I want you to like it.

19
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:40,500
- I'm getting out.
- No-no-no. Wait until I park.

20
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:43,000
Everyone's already inside.

21
00:02:43,100 --> 00:02:45,600
Fan, careful crossing the street.

22
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:20,900
You stupid--

23
00:04:32,900 --> 00:04:35,500
- Metro desk, Ian Wood.
- Listen carefully.

24
00:04:36,100 --> 00:04:39,600
An action wing of the Authentic UDI
has just exploded a bomb...

25
00:04:39,700 --> 00:04:43,900
at the OBT Bank in Knightsbridge.
The code word is "Phoenix'.

26
00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:47,000
Britain's banks are now
targets for the Authentic UDI.

27
00:04:47,100 --> 00:04:49,000
The bombings will continue
as long as...

28
00:04:49,100 --> 00:04:52,100
Britain's financial criminal
institutions persist in their support...

29
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:54,700
of the illegal occupation
of Northern Ireland.

30
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,700
A bomb just went off,
an OBT Bank in Knightsbridge.

31
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:06,000
A group called The Authentic UDI just
phoned it in. They're claiming credit.

32
00:05:07,133 --> 00:05:11,400
Christ. There goes the Peace Accord
back in the shit.

33
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:22,200
... about the number
police officials

34
00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:24,800
have current estimates
on the dead and injured.

35
00:05:24,900 --> 00:05:27,700
but there have been
no further updates.

36
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:30,800
As you can see, it's a highly
fluid situation.

37
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:12,800
This is a major incident that they're
treating as a possible terrorist attack.

38
00:06:12,900 --> 00:06:17,200
The bomb went off at exactly
4:15 GMT in Knightsbridge.

39
00:06:17,300 --> 00:06:20,500
One theory on the cause
of the blast...

40
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:23,200
was that it may have been
a gasoline explosion underground.

41
00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:25,400
How many?
How manny I get?

42
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,800
12 dead so far, three times
as many injured.

43
00:06:28,900 --> 00:06:31,800
The explosion was centered at the
OBT Bank Branch in Knightsbridge.

44
00:06:31,900 --> 00:06:35,100
There was no warning and police
were taken completely by surprise.

45
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:37,300
Fuck warnings.
That'll teach 'em.

46
00:06:40,300 --> 00:06:42,100
Any problems?

47
00:06:43,900 --> 00:06:46,100
- No.
- We should be moving.

48
00:06:46,700 --> 00:06:48,000
That's the normal procedure.

49
00:06:48,100 --> 00:06:51,700
Every cop, hotel, and landlady in London
is now looking for the Irishman.

50
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:56,300
This place is safe,
so long as we stay put.

51
00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:01,500
BELFAST, NORTHERN IRELAND

52
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:19,900
Could I go to jail
if I murdered your phone?

53
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,700
Destruction of government
property?

54
00:07:24,700 --> 00:07:26,500
Absolutely.

55
00:07:26,704 --> 00:07:29,500
Too bad. What's the time?

56
00:07:29,700 --> 00:07:32,300
Almost ten. Ten more minutes.

57
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:35,400
I'll miss my flight.

58
00:07:36,100 --> 00:07:41,100
Let's stay here, door locked,
blinds down...

59
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:44,000
room service for a week.

60
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,300
Sound good?

61
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:48,800
And your work, Deputy Minister?

62
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:51,800
An acute case of food poisoning.

63
00:07:54,300 --> 00:07:56,700
You need to work on your
excuses, darling.

64
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:24,300
Jesus Christ! There's been
a bombing in London.

65
00:08:24,700 --> 00:08:26,700
Scores dead and injured.

66
00:08:34,700 --> 00:08:36,200
Yes? - Jesus, Liam,

67
00:08:36,300 --> 00:08:38,400
half the world's trying
to find you.

68
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:41,200
- Do you even know what's happened?
- Yes, yes, yes, I heard.

69
00:08:41,300 --> 00:08:44,700
I've been trying you
for hours. Where've you been?

70
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:48,000
- Meetings. - Meetings?
- Aye.

71
00:08:48,700 --> 00:08:50,200
And last night?

72
00:08:50,875 --> 00:08:53,100
You didn't come home.
I was worried.

73
00:08:53,900 --> 00:08:56,400
Came in late, left early.

74
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
Lot of work to catch up on.

75
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:03,700
- But the guest room wasn't slept in.
- Who said I slept?

76
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:05,600
Oh, cut the crap, Liam.

77
00:09:05,700 --> 00:09:07,300
You didn't come home,
plain and simple.

78
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:09,200
And what if I didn't?

79
00:09:09,700 --> 00:09:12,300
Look, I've got a lot
to deal with, okay?

80
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:14,900
So don't wait up,
and don't be worried.

81
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:20,100
Sunday is the 20th anniversary
of my brother's death.

82
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:24,100
Saint Mary's is dedicating
a mass to him, so--

83
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:27,300
I'll have Beth put it in the
calendar, okay? We'll talk later.

84
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,300
Oh, Jesus.

85
00:11:00,561 --> 00:11:03,200
Yes, I understand the need
for swift action.

86
00:11:03,300 --> 00:11:06,300
But until we can identify the threat,
there's not much we can do.

87
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:10,200
Well, you'll have finger on the pulse
over there, Liam. We're depending on you.

88
00:11:10,300 --> 00:11:14,100
Anything you can provide, anything
at all, would be a tremendous help.

89
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:15,700
I'm meeting the Council now.

90
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:18,700
I'll shake the trees as hard
as I can and see what falls.

91
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:22,500
But there are new upstarts in the ranks,
pressing for the way things were.

92
00:11:22,900 --> 00:11:26,900
I could use something now.
And you know what I'm refering to.

93
00:11:28,100 --> 00:11:29,900
The Royal Pardons.

94
00:11:31,100 --> 00:11:33,500
I remember your list,
the 40 „On-the-Runs”.

95
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:36,300
- Are we really back to that?
- My Cousin's on that list.

96
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:39,800
He hasn't even been convicted
of any paramilitary offenses.

97
00:11:39,900 --> 00:11:43,500
These people are suspects
in many things, including murder.

98
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:46,600
These people are critical
to holding the peace together now.

99
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:50,900
A few letters of pardon
would be a small gesture.

100
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:52,800
We keep it quiet.

101
00:11:52,900 --> 00:11:55,500
But knowing it's been considered
gives me the leeway...

102
00:11:55,700 --> 00:11:58,500
to press certain men
for something in return.

103
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:03,000
As Irish Deputy Minister you have served
the British government honorably...

104
00:12:03,100 --> 00:12:07,000
which hasn't always been easy.
But appeasement is a dangerous thing.

105
00:12:07,100 --> 00:12:09,100
These are longstanding issues.

106
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:11,400
That if adressed now
would smack of appeasement.

107
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:12,900
I need something, Kate.

108
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:16,000
The newer members haven't lived
the bloodshed and are easily swayed.

109
00:12:16,100 --> 00:12:18,300
I'm trying to hold this together.

110
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:22,200
A gesture is all.
It would make a difference.

111
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:24,300
I'll consider it.

112
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:29,700
But I want something first.
Something real.

113
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,200
Understood.

114
00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:56,800
Hello?

115
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:05,800
We're closed.
We open at 12.

116
00:13:06,300 --> 00:13:08,700
We're looking for the owner,
a Mr. Quin Minh?

117
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,400
Quan.
Upstairs.

118
00:13:15,700 --> 00:13:19,100
They were found on site,
not far from your daughter's body.

119
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:22,401
Can you positively
identify them as hers?

120
00:13:23,700 --> 00:13:24,900
Who did this?

121
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:28,800
As of now, Sir, we don't know,
but we're going to find out.

122
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:31,100
Why my daughter?

123
00:13:32,900 --> 00:13:36,800
Is there someone we can call
to come and be with you, Mr. Quan?

124
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:44,200
I have no more family.

125
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:53,600
- These bombers, will you catch them?
- Yes.

126
00:13:56,100 --> 00:13:59,500
- Will they be punished?
- Yes, they certainly will.

127
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:02,100
We'll let ourselves out.

128
00:14:19,700 --> 00:14:22,900
- Good morning, Hugh. Thanks for coming.
- Been a long time, Liam.

129
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,500
It's been a long time, indeed.
Come, take a chair there.

130
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:29,600
- All right, Hugh?
- Now that we're all here,

131
00:14:30,300 --> 00:14:33,600
does anyone know
who the Authentic UDI is?

132
00:14:33,900 --> 00:14:36,200
Are they even part of the UDI?

133
00:14:36,300 --> 00:14:40,000
Some new upstarts or
something else entirely?

134
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:45,600
They're trying to undermine everything
we've achieved over the last 19 years.

135
00:14:45,700 --> 00:14:47,300
Well I won't have it.

136
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:50,700
They don't have the support of
the people who said no to the violence.

137
00:14:51,584 --> 00:14:54,800
Our mandate's to uphold that choice
and maintain the Peace Accord,

138
00:14:54,900 --> 00:14:56,800
no matter what.
Are we in agreement?

139
00:14:56,900 --> 00:14:59,800
There's a lot of support for their
actions amongst the younger ranks.

140
00:14:59,900 --> 00:15:04,200
Hotheads. Hotheads who don't
remember or know any better.

141
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:08,000
- You were one of those
hotheads, Liam. - Aye.

142
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:12,200
Long ago, when it was the only way.
And what did it give us?

143
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:14,800
More graves than
I care to remember.

144
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:18,500
This bombing rivals Omagh
with it's civilian deaths.

145
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:22,000
It's unacceptable,
anytime, anywhere!

146
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:24,500
And do you think the bombers
come from our ranks?

147
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:26,700
The Brits ID'd the explosive.

148
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:30,400
Czech-made Semtex
from our dumps.

149
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:32,900
They also used
our code word,

150
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:36,000
which means they have
a contact in our command.

151
00:15:36,300 --> 00:15:38,300
Maybe someone in this room.

152
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:46,700
They're trying to divide us, put
the Brits back on the streets again,

153
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:49,700
stir up the Troubles all over
again. Well I won't have it!

154
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:53,200
I want a complete check of all
the arms dumps here and abroad,

155
00:15:53,300 --> 00:15:57,200
everything verified, guns,
Semtex, the whole fuckin' lot.

156
00:15:57,300 --> 00:16:00,600
- Jesus, you can't be serious.
- Never been more so, Patty.

157
00:16:00,700 --> 00:16:02,900
We check 'em and if
something's missing,

158
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,500
we trace it back to those
who knew the location.

159
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:09,300
And then we deal with this
internally.

160
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:13,300
I want a complete list
of all the stocks within the week,

161
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:16,600
along with their locations and
everyone who knows where they are.

162
00:16:16,700 --> 00:16:18,700
And no fuckin' exceptions!

163
00:16:20,100 --> 00:16:23,700
SO15 COUNTER TERRORISM COMMAND,
LONDON

164
00:16:31,900 --> 00:16:33,200
Show me.

165
00:16:33,700 --> 00:16:35,500
We backtracked 47 minutes.

166
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:37,300
Clearly anticipated the CCTV.

167
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:40,000
He circled London for quite some time
prior to the bombing.

168
00:16:40,100 --> 00:16:42,300
Now, this is the firstCC feed
we have on him.

169
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:46,100
Heading southbound on the A413
near Wendover at 10:53 AM.

170
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:48,900
We retrieved the serial number
from the bike's frame.

171
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,600
It was reported stolen in Reading
the night before.

172
00:16:51,700 --> 00:16:54,900
The license plates were also stolen
from another bike in Reading.

173
00:16:55,300 --> 00:16:56,600
What about phone calls?

174
00:16:56,700 --> 00:16:59,100
Assuming that the bomb
was phone-activated,

175
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:01,600
we've dumped the five closest
towers to the blast zone,

176
00:17:01,700 --> 00:17:04,900
trying to ID any call terminating
at the time of the incident.

177
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,300
Sorry. Excuse me.

178
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:09,300
Yup.
For you.

179
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:12,000
- Bromley.
- He's here again, Sir.

180
00:17:12,100 --> 00:17:14,200
- The Chinese man.
- What?

181
00:17:14,300 --> 00:17:17,200
The Chinaman.
It's five days in a row, now.

182
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:22,000
- Christ. Tell him I'm busy.
- I did, and he said he'd wait, again.

183
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:27,600
I assure you, this investigation
is our top priority, Mr Quan.

184
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:31,200
And we're doing all we can
and pursuing every possible lead...

185
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:33,500
to find those
who killed your daughter.

186
00:17:37,900 --> 00:17:40,300
But they're a difficult
people to catch.

187
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:42,500
And it may take some time.

188
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,600
I need you to understand that.

189
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:47,700
You must catch these men,
Commander Bromley.

190
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:50,200
Again, it's our top priority.

191
00:17:57,300 --> 00:17:58,900
20,000 pounds.

192
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:04,300
All I have for the names
of the bombers.

193
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:06,700
To be clear...

194
00:18:07,300 --> 00:18:10,200
these are vicious men
who take pride in their attrocities.

195
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:14,400
Any attempt by you to contact them
is likely to end very badly.

196
00:18:14,900 --> 00:18:16,700
This is our work, not yours.

197
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:18,700
You need to be patient.

198
00:18:23,500 --> 00:18:26,100
How long have you been
in this country, Mr. Quan?

199
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:30,300
Since 1984. I'm a British citizen.

200
00:18:31,100 --> 00:18:33,300
You were born in Guangxi, China.

201
00:18:35,700 --> 00:18:38,000
Yes. I'm Chinese.

202
00:18:38,300 --> 00:18:40,700
I live in Ho Chi Minh
after the war.

203
00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:42,600
We escaped to Singapore.

204
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:44,800
Then we immigrated here.

205
00:18:47,100 --> 00:18:49,200
You had two daughters before Fan.

206
00:18:50,100 --> 00:18:52,100
Both killed during the escape.

207
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:54,600
And your wife?

208
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,600
Where is she now?

209
00:18:58,500 --> 00:19:00,900
She died giving birth to Fan.

210
00:19:04,100 --> 00:19:06,000
I'm truly sorry for your loss.

211
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:13,000
But you musn't keep coming
here on a daily basis.

212
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:15,200
It doesn't help,

213
00:19:15,800 --> 00:19:18,500
and diverts time and resources
from our investigation.

214
00:19:21,100 --> 00:19:22,400
Do you understand?

215
00:19:25,900 --> 00:19:28,600
Yes, I understand.

216
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:36,700
Thank you for seeing me,
Commander Bromley.

217
00:19:47,500 --> 00:19:50,000
After three weeks
of investigations,

218
00:19:50,100 --> 00:19:52,900
there's little in the way
of solid leads that I'm aware of.

219
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,100
The public is looking
for reassurance.

220
00:19:55,700 --> 00:19:59,000
One leading politician who
somberly may have answers...

221
00:19:59,100 --> 00:20:02,300
lies uncomfortably at the
center of this storm.

222
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:05,700
We go now to an interview
I recorded earlier in Belfast...

223
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:07,800
with Deputy Minister
Liam Hennessey.

224
00:20:08,900 --> 00:20:12,500
Deputy Minister Hennessey, you've
publically condemned the bombings.

225
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:17,700
What's the essential difference between
those acts you were involved in then...

226
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:19,500
and what's happened
in London recently?

227
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:22,200
Hope. We had none,

228
00:20:22,300 --> 00:20:24,400
just years of vengeance.

229
00:20:24,500 --> 00:20:27,200
I believe the men
behind this terrible act

230
00:20:27,300 --> 00:20:29,700
never experienced
firsthand the troubles.

231
00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:33,300
And for some they are more than happy
to resort to violence...

232
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:35,300
to upset the status quo.

233
00:20:43,437 --> 00:20:47,550
Prepared for your signature.
They absolutely must be signed now.

234
00:20:48,110 --> 00:20:50,300
What's the latest reaction
on social media?

235
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:52,900
The same as before.
Fear and anger.

236
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:56,100
- Anger directed at whom?
- From the Prime Minister on down.

237
00:20:56,600 --> 00:20:58,900
CNN and the Irish Times
want interviews with you.

238
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:00,900
You can do tonight or
tomorrow morning at eight.

239
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:05,400
- Tomorrow morning by phone. What else?
- You've a call waitin' on line two.

240
00:21:05,700 --> 00:21:08,000
- Waiting?
- For 30 minutes now.

241
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:10,900
A Mr Quan from London,
very insistent.

242
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,400
What does he want?

243
00:21:12,500 --> 00:21:14,300
His daughter was killed
in the bombing.

244
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:17,600
I tried my best to console him, but
he really just wants to speak to you.

245
00:21:17,700 --> 00:21:20,400
- He saw you on TV.
- Oh, Christ, Beth.

246
00:21:20,500 --> 00:21:23,100
Civic duty. Take it and be done.

247
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:31,100
This is Liam Hennessey.
How may I help you?

248
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:34,400
Mr. Hennessey, tell me
who kill my daughter.

249
00:21:34,500 --> 00:21:37,600
What on earth makes you think
I know who killed your daughter?

250
00:21:38,300 --> 00:21:40,700
Because, you are
the First Deputy Minister

251
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:44,700
and advisor to Quinnshae,
and a former UDI member.

252
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:49,500
I am truly sad for your loss, Mr. Quan.
I have a daughter myself.

253
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:52,300
And I condemn these acts of violence,
but I can't help you.

254
00:21:52,600 --> 00:21:56,200
Then please tell me someone who might
know the names of the bombers...

255
00:21:56,300 --> 00:21:57,900
someone I can talk to.

256
00:21:58,600 --> 00:22:01,800
I don't have any connections
to those sorts of people. I'm sorry.

257
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:04,400
I don't believe you, Mr. Hennessey.

258
00:22:04,700 --> 00:22:06,400
You are a very powerful man.

259
00:22:06,500 --> 00:22:09,300
Well, I work for the government
and our elected officials.

260
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:11,600
I do not work for terrorists.

261
00:22:11,700 --> 00:22:15,200
Politics and terrorism are
different ends of the same snake.

262
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:18,500
Whichever end you grabe,
you still grab a snake.

263
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:23,200
It makes a great deal of difference which
end you grab, because one end will bite.

264
00:22:23,500 --> 00:22:24,800
Again,

265
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:28,300
I'm sorry for your loss,
Mr. Quan. Good day.

266
00:22:54,100 --> 00:22:58,900
Daughters slaughtered by Thai pirates.
An immigrant tragic story.

267
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,900
What are you doing?

268
00:23:23,300 --> 00:23:25,300
You have to stop this.

269
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:28,700
This wasn't your fault.

270
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:33,000
I failed them.

271
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:40,400
What is this?

272
00:23:40,500 --> 00:23:42,700
The restaurant is now yours.

273
00:23:43,800 --> 00:23:47,400
You've been a good
friend to me, Lam.

274
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:50,400
No more of this talk.

275
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:52,500
Look at me.

276
00:23:56,500 --> 00:23:59,700
I'm not going home. I'm staying
the night. I will sleep on the couch.

277
00:23:59,800 --> 00:24:02,400
And on Monday I'm taking you
to see someone.

278
00:24:02,500 --> 00:24:05,900
Someone who can help you.
But no more of this talk. Okay?

279
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:11,200
Quan!

280
00:25:14,900 --> 00:25:16,300
Quan!

281
00:25:21,100 --> 00:25:23,600
I've been calling you all night.
Where were you?

282
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:26,400
What are you going to do?

283
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:29,700
When will you come back?

284
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:49,700
PORT OF LARNE,
NORTHERN IRELAND.

285
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:43,500
You have a room?

286
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:46,700
They are important documents
that we must have today.

287
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:49,000
Yes, I will keep
trying the sender,

288
00:26:49,100 --> 00:26:51,100
because apparently
there's nothing else I can do.

289
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:54,700
which I find strange and certainly
not the service I've come to expect.

290
00:26:54,800 --> 00:26:59,000
Yes, 329174-N for November.

291
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:03,600
You tell your supervisor
I'll be calling back. Good day.

292
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:07,100
Yes? May I help you?

293
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:09,500
Please, I would like
to speak to Mr. Hennessey.

294
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:12,400
- And your name?
- Ngoc Minh Quan.

295
00:27:12,900 --> 00:27:16,700
- You are the one who's been phoning.
- Yes. I phoned many times.

296
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:20,400
I am afraid the Deputy Minister
is busy and won't be able to see you.

297
00:27:21,100 --> 00:27:24,200
- I will wait.
- No, you must leave.

298
00:27:24,600 --> 00:27:26,400
Best do as the lady says.

299
00:27:26,900 --> 00:27:29,200
He's been phoning up
at all hours asking for Liam.

300
00:27:29,300 --> 00:27:31,800
- He won't take no for an answer.
- Just groceries.

301
00:27:33,700 --> 00:27:36,200
Go now,
before we make you.

302
00:27:38,900 --> 00:27:41,200
- No. I'll wait.
- Right.

303
00:27:47,700 --> 00:27:50,000
It's the man who's been
phoning you from London.

304
00:27:50,100 --> 00:27:53,100
He's got a knife on him
One of those Swiss Army types.

305
00:27:54,100 --> 00:27:56,100
Well, take it off him.

306
00:27:56,700 --> 00:27:59,600
Jesus, how much damage can he do
with you two around?

307
00:27:59,900 --> 00:28:01,089
Let him be.

308
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:05,400
As I explained before,
I don't know who the bombers are.

309
00:28:05,500 --> 00:28:08,500
I realize that you're angry,
but there's not much I can do.

310
00:28:08,800 --> 00:28:11,300
It's also very dangerous
for you to be here.

311
00:28:12,300 --> 00:28:15,700
People in Belfast won't take
kindly to your accusations.

312
00:28:16,800 --> 00:28:19,100
If you do not know who they are,

313
00:28:19,900 --> 00:28:22,000
I would like you
to please find out.

314
00:28:25,300 --> 00:28:27,200
DEPUTY MINISTER HENNESSEY
PROUD OF HIS UDI ROOTS

315
00:28:27,300 --> 00:28:29,600
I haven't been affiliated
for 30 years.

316
00:28:29,700 --> 00:28:32,500
When I was, I fought hard
against the violence.

317
00:28:32,600 --> 00:28:35,300
I went to prison for what I did
and paid my debt.

318
00:28:35,400 --> 00:28:37,600
Now I serve politics
of both sides...

319
00:28:37,900 --> 00:28:40,500
trying to heal the wounds
and bridge the divide.

320
00:28:41,700 --> 00:28:43,000
Again,

321
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:47,000
my sincere condolences,
but there's nothing I can do.

322
00:28:47,900 --> 00:28:51,300
What if your wife and daughter
were killed by a bomb?

323
00:28:53,500 --> 00:28:56,400
I'd do everything in my power
to get justice.

324
00:28:56,700 --> 00:29:00,200
So, I've chosen you, Mr. Hennessey.

325
00:29:00,700 --> 00:29:03,400
You will tell me
who killed my child.

326
00:29:03,500 --> 00:29:05,000
Again,

327
00:29:05,500 --> 00:29:06,900
I don't know.

328
00:29:10,300 --> 00:29:12,200
You will change your mind.

329
00:29:15,300 --> 00:29:18,700
Thank you for seeing me,
First Minister Hennessey.

330
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:35,900
I'm sorry, Liam.
He took me by surprise.

331
00:30:44,500 --> 00:30:47,500
Are you okay, Beth?
You're okay--

332
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:49,100
Take her, take her.

333
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:51,600
- Murphy, have the boys
check the building. - Right.

334
00:30:59,700 --> 00:31:01,700
Would you like a whiskey,
inspector?

335
00:31:02,100 --> 00:31:03,600
No, thank you.

336
00:31:05,300 --> 00:31:08,600
I suppose it would be a waste of time
asking who might've done this.

337
00:31:09,700 --> 00:31:11,300
No one comes to mind.

338
00:31:12,800 --> 00:31:14,100
Well...

339
00:31:14,500 --> 00:31:16,800
it appears to have been
nothing more than a warning.

340
00:31:16,900 --> 00:31:19,000
Fortunately, it wasn't
a serious bomb.

341
00:31:19,700 --> 00:31:22,000
If it had been, we wouldn't
be here, would we?

342
00:31:23,700 --> 00:31:25,400
Feel free to reach out,

343
00:31:25,500 --> 00:31:27,800
should you have
the unexpected urge.

344
00:31:28,800 --> 00:31:31,700
I'll feed the press
a gas leak story in the meantime.

345
00:31:32,200 --> 00:31:34,800
Fair enough.
Thanks very much, inspector.

346
00:31:37,400 --> 00:31:38,500
Hello?

347
00:31:41,300 --> 00:31:42,600
It's him.

348
00:31:48,500 --> 00:31:51,300
You come to my office
and plant a fucking bomb?

349
00:31:51,400 --> 00:31:53,900
- Have you changed your mind?
- Changed my mind?

350
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,000
Are you out of your fuckin' tree?

351
00:31:56,100 --> 00:31:58,100
You have no idea
who you're dealing with.

352
00:31:58,200 --> 00:32:00,600
- But you'll soon find out.
- Give me the names.

353
00:32:00,700 --> 00:32:03,200
I'll tell you what.
Let's meet face-to-face.

354
00:32:03,300 --> 00:32:04,500
We'll settle--

355
00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:09,000
That fuckin' wanker
threatened me and hung up.

356
00:32:09,700 --> 00:32:14,300
Right. Let's check all the hotels and
guest houses. He won't be hard to find.

357
00:32:16,700 --> 00:32:18,000
Fuckin' Chinaman.

358
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:23,700
Uncle Liam? What's up?

359
00:32:23,800 --> 00:32:25,700
NEW YORK

360
00:32:29,016 --> 00:32:30,217
I'll be there.

361
00:33:38,641 --> 00:33:41,000
Stop! Hold it, hold it!
Don't move!

362
00:33:41,300 --> 00:33:42,500
Don't move!

363
00:33:43,400 --> 00:33:45,200
She's wired to blow!

364
00:34:11,400 --> 00:34:13,300
NAMES

365
00:34:19,600 --> 00:34:21,700
Two sets of wires
ten foot long...

366
00:34:21,800 --> 00:34:25,100
soldered to that light bulb and
covered with ground-up match heads.

367
00:34:25,400 --> 00:34:27,300
Gives an extra kick.

368
00:34:27,600 --> 00:34:29,700
Not needed, but a nice touch.

369
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:32,400
Crude, effective, and easy to spot.

370
00:34:32,500 --> 00:34:34,100
So he wanted us to see it.

371
00:34:34,200 --> 00:34:36,500
Well it wasn't in the tank
so it wouldn't 've worked.

372
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:39,100
He just wants you to know
he can get to you.

373
00:34:41,200 --> 00:34:42,400
Mickey.

374
00:34:43,200 --> 00:34:46,400
We found him.
A B&B in Wellington Park.

375
00:34:47,100 --> 00:34:49,000
- They found him.
- Grab him.

376
00:34:49,100 --> 00:34:52,400
Drag him out of Belfast.
Discourage him from returning.

377
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:54,600
Wait for me. I'm on my way.

378
00:34:58,500 --> 00:34:59,600
Hello.

379
00:34:59,700 --> 00:35:01,600
I hear your office was bombed.

380
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:05,400
Hardly. It was the toilet
in the hall.

381
00:35:05,500 --> 00:35:08,400
An Asian man in his 60's
with a grudge.

382
00:35:08,500 --> 00:35:10,800
- It's all being taken care of.
- Why'd he do it?

383
00:35:10,900 --> 00:35:14,200
His child died in the bank bombing.
He thinks I know who did it.

384
00:35:14,300 --> 00:35:16,400
He's not the only one
of that mind.

385
00:35:16,500 --> 00:35:18,400
So where are we
with the pardons?

386
00:35:18,500 --> 00:35:20,000
Lots of resistance.

387
00:35:20,100 --> 00:35:23,700
But if you give us something useful,
things might turn in your favor.

388
00:35:23,800 --> 00:35:26,800
I have a lead.
I'm pursuing it.

389
00:35:27,900 --> 00:35:31,200
Well, let's hope it bears fruit.
People here want heads.

390
00:35:31,300 --> 00:35:33,900
The dogs won't stay leashed
much longer.

391
00:35:45,600 --> 00:35:47,400
Top floor on the right.

392
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:56,100
Fuckin' get in!

393
00:38:21,300 --> 00:38:24,400
Christ Almighty,
are you dumb and blind?

394
00:38:24,500 --> 00:38:26,900
An old man making fools
out of the lot of you,

395
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:29,500
and he's still running around
out here, for God's sake.

396
00:38:29,600 --> 00:38:31,800
You are four men. Four.

397
00:38:31,900 --> 00:38:34,400
We had him cornered, then
he jumped off the roof,

398
00:38:34,500 --> 00:38:37,500
- and slid down like some
fuckin' monkey. - What is goin' on?

399
00:38:39,500 --> 00:38:42,400
Pack your bag.
You're going to the farm.

400
00:38:43,600 --> 00:38:46,000
Go on. Get your things.

401
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:52,700
- You all right, Sean?
- Hi, Christy.

402
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:54,900
Go on through,
he's expecting you.

403
00:38:58,600 --> 00:39:01,600
Beat ya up. Come on in
and have a drink, for God's sake.

404
00:39:01,700 --> 00:39:03,200
Well, look at you.

405
00:39:03,300 --> 00:39:05,500
- Jesus, the place looks well.
- It's not bad, is it?

406
00:39:05,600 --> 00:39:07,500
- No.
- You're a sight for sore eyes.

407
00:39:07,600 --> 00:39:10,906
- So how is New York treatin' you?
- Ah, it's cold.

408
00:39:12,659 --> 00:39:14,900
Look, Murphy filled me in, there.

409
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:16,600
That bloody Chinaman.

410
00:39:16,700 --> 00:39:19,300
He set off a bomb in my office,
put one in my Jag...

411
00:39:19,400 --> 00:39:21,400
and beat the bejesus out
of Mick and Jimmy.

412
00:39:21,500 --> 00:39:23,100
Do you want me to handle him?

413
00:39:23,500 --> 00:39:26,700
No. That's Kavanagh's problem.

414
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:31,600
I need your help
with the London bombing.

415
00:39:33,400 --> 00:39:35,700
Any idea who's behind it yet?

416
00:39:37,300 --> 00:39:38,500
Not at all.

417
00:39:39,500 --> 00:39:41,400
Well, the Yanks
aren't happy, Liam.

418
00:39:41,700 --> 00:39:45,000
Dead women and kids all over the news.
Any fundraising now is impossible.

419
00:39:45,100 --> 00:39:47,900
Yeah, this is not
about foundraising, Sean.

420
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:50,600
I need you to go to London
and meet someone.

421
00:39:51,300 --> 00:39:54,800
A Richard Bromley in SO15.

422
00:39:56,200 --> 00:39:59,500
- SO15? - He needs to know
the bombings aren't ours...

423
00:39:59,600 --> 00:40:02,800
and that we're working the problem
hard, but we need his help.

424
00:40:02,900 --> 00:40:04,000
Why me?

425
00:40:04,100 --> 00:40:06,900
You're a decorated Ranger
in the Royal Irish Regiment.

426
00:40:07,500 --> 00:40:11,500
Bromley will respect you as much as
he's capable of respecting any of us.

427
00:40:11,800 --> 00:40:15,700
Should anyone find out that
we're talking to the Brits,

428
00:40:15,800 --> 00:40:18,700
to go after one of our own,
rogue or not,

429
00:40:19,400 --> 00:40:21,500
there'll be the devil to pay.

430
00:40:23,100 --> 00:40:25,100
So, can I count on you, Sean...

431
00:40:25,500 --> 00:40:27,000
to be discreet?

432
00:40:28,700 --> 00:40:30,100
Of course.

433
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:18,700
- Right this way, sir.
- Thank you very much.

434
00:41:29,800 --> 00:41:31,300
You took your time.

435
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:35,200
I just had to put out
the odd fire here and there.

436
00:41:41,800 --> 00:41:44,400
- I'll be back in a minute.
- I'll be right here.

437
00:41:57,600 --> 00:41:58,600
Jesus

438
00:41:58,700 --> 00:42:00,600
I want the names.

439
00:42:13,400 --> 00:42:16,000
ROYAL NAVAL COLLEGE, GREENWICH

440
00:42:19,500 --> 00:42:20,900
Mr. Morrison.

441
00:42:24,500 --> 00:42:25,900
Commander Bromley.

442
00:42:28,100 --> 00:42:30,100
- We're not responsible.
- Really?

443
00:42:30,200 --> 00:42:33,200
Forensic evidence and the use
of your code word suggests otherwise.

444
00:42:33,300 --> 00:42:36,000
It's a renegade unit.
We don't know who they are yet.

445
00:42:36,100 --> 00:42:38,500
You're telling me there's
an active UDI unit on the loose...

446
00:42:38,600 --> 00:42:40,800
- you don't know nothing about?
- Yes I am.

447
00:42:40,900 --> 00:42:43,800
- And the Semtex?
- They're raiding our dumps.

448
00:42:43,900 --> 00:42:45,900
Dumps that were all given up
for the Accord?

449
00:42:46,300 --> 00:42:47,800
And your code word?

450
00:42:47,900 --> 00:42:50,100
They're being helped by someone
in our command.

451
00:42:50,200 --> 00:42:52,900
- Belfast or Dublin.
- What do you want, Mr. Morrison?

452
00:42:53,700 --> 00:42:54,900
We've a plan.

453
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:57,400
Different codes will be given
to each member of command.

454
00:42:57,500 --> 00:42:59,500
When the bombers claim credit
for the next attack,

455
00:42:59,600 --> 00:43:02,600
you'll tell us which word they use.
Then we'll know who gave the orders

456
00:43:02,700 --> 00:43:05,500
- and then we end it.
- Who else is involved in this plan?

457
00:43:05,600 --> 00:43:06,900
Liam Hennessey.

458
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:09,200
So you can appreciate
the need for discretion.

459
00:43:09,300 --> 00:43:11,100
Only Liam knows who will be
given which word.

460
00:43:11,200 --> 00:43:14,100
So Hennessey will personally work
with us to take out a UDI cell?

461
00:43:14,200 --> 00:43:16,600
- A rogue cell.
- Your people, nonetheless.

462
00:43:18,900 --> 00:43:20,500
I've one condition.

463
00:43:22,100 --> 00:43:25,100
When Hennessey finds the bombers,
he tells me directly.

464
00:43:25,200 --> 00:43:27,800
Then we take them down.
Not you.

465
00:43:28,700 --> 00:43:30,600
This is non-negotiable.

466
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:57,200
We found some plastic bags
in his room.

467
00:43:57,300 --> 00:43:59,800
Based on what I saw,
he's brewed up some nitroglycerin,

468
00:43:59,900 --> 00:44:03,500
mixed it with weed killer, packed
into some plastic plumbing pipes.

469
00:44:03,600 --> 00:44:07,200
I'm guessing he's made four bombs,
each enough to blow up a lorry.

470
00:44:07,300 --> 00:44:10,500
- Jesus - When he surfaces
in Belfast, we'll find him.

471
00:44:11,300 --> 00:44:12,700
You'll be safe here.

472
00:44:13,400 --> 00:44:14,600
Aye.

473
00:44:15,600 --> 00:44:17,300
I wouldn't count on it.

474
00:46:38,700 --> 00:46:39,900
Benny.

475
00:48:00,600 --> 00:48:04,100
Jesus. He roughed up
Benny and Sean.

476
00:48:04,200 --> 00:48:05,600
They'll be fine.

477
00:48:05,700 --> 00:48:07,195
Get more men from Belfast.

478
00:48:07,500 --> 00:48:11,000
I've underestimated him.
It won't happen again.

479
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:25,900
It's another warning, Liam?

480
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:27,000
Aye.

481
00:48:27,100 --> 00:48:28,800
Nothing I can't handle.

482
00:48:28,900 --> 00:48:30,700
First Belfast, now here.

483
00:48:30,800 --> 00:48:32,900
How in God's name
are you handling anything?

484
00:48:33,200 --> 00:48:35,100
The problem's being dealt with.

485
00:48:35,500 --> 00:48:37,600
He is destroying our farmhouse...

486
00:48:37,700 --> 00:48:40,900
intent on God knows what,
and you calling it a problem?

487
00:48:41,500 --> 00:48:43,800
God, you can be
so pompous sometimes.

488
00:48:43,900 --> 00:48:46,400
I'm leaving for London.
Gonna stay at Keri's.

489
00:48:46,500 --> 00:48:48,400
I'm not sure
that's a good idea.

490
00:48:48,500 --> 00:48:50,500
Well, I wasn't asking
for your permission.

491
00:48:50,600 --> 00:48:53,300
He's hardly likely to know about
our daughter's flat, and besides...

492
00:48:53,400 --> 00:48:54,700
it's you he's after, not me.

493
00:48:54,800 --> 00:48:57,100
Well, the point is, if he knows
about the farmhouse,

494
00:48:57,200 --> 00:48:59,300
I assume he knows
about Keri's flat.

495
00:48:59,600 --> 00:49:00,900
It's not worth the risk.

496
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:03,600
Well then, you're just gonna have
to handle it, like you said.

497
00:49:05,300 --> 00:49:08,700
I remember a time when you would've
dealt with this, properly.

498
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:11,400
And other things too.

499
00:49:11,500 --> 00:49:13,100
Those days are gone.

500
00:49:32,100 --> 00:49:34,900
Weighs a bit more, but
shouldn't be noticeable.

501
00:49:36,200 --> 00:49:39,600
All I'm adding is the Semtex,
a microchip and a few inches of wire.

502
00:49:39,900 --> 00:49:41,000
It looks good.

503
00:49:41,100 --> 00:49:43,800
Tricky part will be getting
it through the scanner, but...

504
00:49:44,100 --> 00:49:46,700
- we'll find a way.
- And if it's turned on?

505
00:49:47,200 --> 00:49:49,900
Shorter battery life,
but it'll work, no problem.

506
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:52,300
- Any idea which plane yet?
- No.

507
00:49:52,800 --> 00:49:55,000
We don't want to hit a flight
with any Irish onboard.

508
00:49:55,100 --> 00:49:57,500
One in the Queen's
fleet'd be best.

509
00:49:57,600 --> 00:49:59,800
We just need the right mule.

510
00:50:02,900 --> 00:50:04,700
Code word has changed.

511
00:50:05,300 --> 00:50:06,800
As of tonight.

512
00:50:09,600 --> 00:50:12,000
My news editor's
a complete twat.

513
00:50:12,100 --> 00:50:15,000
Spends as much on a pair of shoes
as I get for eight hours

514
00:50:15,100 --> 00:50:17,500
- writing crap like this.
- Makes perfect sense.

515
00:50:17,600 --> 00:50:20,200
Who doesn't like
a new pair of sexy shoes?

516
00:50:20,300 --> 00:50:22,000
You should try a real whiskey.

517
00:50:22,300 --> 00:50:23,900
Two Jamesons, single malt.

518
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:30,100
"Wife attacks husband's
Transgender lover."

519
00:50:30,200 --> 00:50:32,500
Some serious news
you're writing there.

520
00:50:32,600 --> 00:50:35,100
Well, if it pays, I'll write it.

521
00:50:35,400 --> 00:50:37,900
Beats being knee-deep
in a bloody bomb site.

522
00:50:38,200 --> 00:50:40,900
- So what do you do?
- Wealth management.

523
00:50:50,100 --> 00:50:52,600
- I'm Maggie.
- Ian.

524
00:50:59,400 --> 00:51:00,700
Thanks, Mary.

525
00:51:03,600 --> 00:51:05,600
Six more men are on
their way from Belfast.

526
00:51:05,700 --> 00:51:08,500
When they get here they'll relieve
the fellas who've been up all night.

527
00:51:08,600 --> 00:51:10,900
- Is it enough to secure the farm?
- Secure as it can be.

528
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:13,400
It's 20 total working two shifts.

529
00:51:14,200 --> 00:51:16,600
All right. You're flying
to London today with Mary.

530
00:51:16,700 --> 00:51:18,500
- Right, yeah - That's
completely unnecessary.

531
00:51:18,600 --> 00:51:21,100
Get her into Keri's flat
then move them into a hotel.

532
00:51:21,200 --> 00:51:24,400
- I can manage this, all right?
- I'll not be debating this.

533
00:51:24,800 --> 00:51:27,992
Mick's gonna fill up the Jag.
You are leaving--

534
00:51:46,900 --> 00:51:49,700
Take him to the hospital.
Get Mary to the airport.

535
00:51:49,800 --> 00:51:51,200
- Right.
- Go.

536
00:51:57,300 --> 00:52:00,200
Buried nitro bomb,
detonated by remote.

537
00:52:01,500 --> 00:52:03,300
He needed a line of sight.

538
00:52:04,100 --> 00:52:06,200
Those woods, that's where I'd be.

539
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:10,100
- Go.- Sean! Mick!
Get in the car!

540
00:52:10,200 --> 00:52:11,400
Go, go, go!

541
00:52:31,600 --> 00:52:33,200
Come on. Go, go, go!

542
00:52:42,200 --> 00:52:45,500
You guys spread out.
I'll take the high ground.

543
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:38,500
Names!

544
00:54:05,600 --> 00:54:07,600
Jesus Christ!

545
00:54:07,700 --> 00:54:10,300
One old man running circles
around the lot of us.

546
00:54:11,300 --> 00:54:12,700
Why is it so hard?

547
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:15,200
He's ahead of us
every step of the way.

548
00:54:16,300 --> 00:54:19,400
- We need more men.
- We need 100 more men, at least.

549
00:54:19,500 --> 00:54:22,400
And if we did that, we'd had
the whole Belfast against us.

550
00:54:25,100 --> 00:54:28,000
Bring in a tracker,
someone who knows the woods...

551
00:54:28,100 --> 00:54:30,000
and beat him at his own game.

552
00:54:31,100 --> 00:54:34,800
- My nephew?
- Aye. If you can spare him.

553
00:55:04,400 --> 00:55:05,900
Come on.

554
00:55:25,200 --> 00:55:27,200
Oh, you--
Oh, you've gotta be kiddin'.

555
00:55:31,600 --> 00:55:35,000
- Liam? - Tell Bromley,
I'll accept his terms.

556
00:55:35,300 --> 00:55:36,500
I'll pass it on.

557
00:55:36,600 --> 00:55:39,500
I've given out the code words.
Now we wait.

558
00:55:41,300 --> 00:55:42,800
Quan hit us again.

559
00:55:42,900 --> 00:55:45,200
The wee shitey
injured three more men.

560
00:55:45,300 --> 00:55:47,300
Punji sticks,
if you can believe that.

561
00:55:47,400 --> 00:55:49,200
Liam, it sounds
like he's trained,

562
00:55:49,300 --> 00:55:50,800
Maybe Special Forces.

563
00:55:50,900 --> 00:55:52,400
Which brings me to the point.

564
00:55:52,500 --> 00:55:55,800
I need a tracker, Sean.
Can you give us a hand?

565
00:55:56,600 --> 00:55:59,100
- I'll take a morning flight.
- Good man.

566
00:56:07,300 --> 00:56:08,500
Hey.

567
00:56:10,400 --> 00:56:11,900
How'd he sound?

568
00:56:13,200 --> 00:56:14,600
Worried.

569
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:17,300
He's got a lot going on.

570
00:56:17,400 --> 00:56:19,800
Well if he doesn't find
the bombers, the Accord's dead.

571
00:56:19,900 --> 00:56:22,000
And politically, so's he.

572
00:56:24,100 --> 00:56:25,900
Do you think he'll find them?

573
00:56:26,800 --> 00:56:28,500
Yeah, if there's another blast.

574
00:56:30,500 --> 00:56:32,600
The code word lead us
to who's running them.

575
00:56:32,700 --> 00:56:35,400
He's finished.
The code word won't save him.

576
00:56:35,700 --> 00:56:37,700
He's afraid to use his power.

577
00:56:37,800 --> 00:56:41,400
He's just a washed-up-old man trying
to hold onto whatever he can.

578
00:56:45,800 --> 00:56:48,700
I've never forgiven him
for my brother, Patrick.

579
00:56:49,600 --> 00:56:52,200
Liam found out
who killed him.

580
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:55,200
A UVF death squad.

581
00:56:56,100 --> 00:56:57,500
Four men.

582
00:56:58,800 --> 00:57:02,400
I told Liam to kill them
before they got to court.

583
00:57:02,700 --> 00:57:04,800
But he said no...

584
00:57:05,100 --> 00:57:07,900
That the time for revenge
is past.

585
00:57:08,900 --> 00:57:11,600
So my Patrick is dead
and buried...

586
00:57:11,900 --> 00:57:15,500
and they're sitting in jail now.
All four of them...

587
00:57:15,600 --> 00:57:18,300
taking classes
at the Open University.

588
00:57:19,100 --> 00:57:21,100
It's not right.

589
00:57:22,100 --> 00:57:23,600
It's not.

590
00:58:16,800 --> 00:58:18,600
It's okay, baby.

591
00:58:41,600 --> 00:58:43,100
Daddy.

592
00:58:44,200 --> 00:58:46,100
Let them go.

593
00:58:46,200 --> 00:58:49,000
Mom! Dad! Help!

594
00:59:33,400 --> 00:59:35,700
Quan's daughters were
kidnapped, raped,

595
00:59:35,800 --> 00:59:38,000
and believed by Quan
to have been murdered.

596
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:51,100
... was one of the most
deadliest fighters

597
00:59:51,200 --> 00:59:52,600
Captured

598
00:59:55,100 --> 00:59:56,400
Special UnitsProject Gamma

599
00:59:56,500 --> 00:59:58,400
...was in a prison

600
01:00:00,400 --> 01:00:02,200
Hugh McGrath's here.

601
01:00:09,300 --> 01:00:11,500
I heard you're checking my dumps

602
01:00:11,600 --> 01:00:14,200
We're checking everyone's.
No exceptions.

603
01:00:14,700 --> 01:00:17,100
Four came up short.
Two were yours.

604
01:00:17,400 --> 01:00:21,300
- Ten kilos of Semtex missing.
- What in God's are you doing?

605
01:00:21,600 --> 01:00:24,400
My dumps were off-limits.
We were clear in that. Remember?

606
01:00:24,500 --> 01:00:26,000
You were at the meeting.

607
01:00:26,100 --> 01:00:28,300
If you knew that were short,
you should've handled it.

608
01:00:28,400 --> 01:00:30,200
They were in perfect order.

609
01:00:30,300 --> 01:00:32,200
I checked'em myself,
and that's a fact.

610
01:00:34,800 --> 01:00:37,900
Christ, Liam, so the Committee
knows it's my Semtex?

611
01:00:42,200 --> 01:00:45,500
Don't know who we can
trust anymore. Do we?

612
01:00:45,600 --> 01:00:47,900
Trust or fear?

613
01:00:48,400 --> 01:00:50,700
In your case, mostly fear.

614
01:00:50,800 --> 01:00:53,700
Simple and brutal,
like my dad taught me.

615
01:00:54,800 --> 01:00:58,600
Look, we have an opportunity here,
Liam, if you take the lead.

616
01:00:58,900 --> 01:01:02,500
This Chinaman isn't helping matters, but
let me get some locals to hunt him down.

617
01:01:02,600 --> 01:01:04,200
- How much do you know?
- Plenty.

618
01:01:04,300 --> 01:01:06,600
Bomb in your office.
Your farm. Your car.

619
01:01:06,700 --> 01:01:09,900
Mary and your daughter hiding out
in a London hotel. A bloody mess, it is.

620
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:13,100
And the men sense weakness,
as do the UVF.

621
01:01:13,200 --> 01:01:16,900
You should be back in Belfast,
out in front, taking charge.

622
01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:20,300
- Look, I'm no politician--
- What're you trying to say?

623
01:01:20,800 --> 01:01:22,400
The bombing.

624
01:01:23,500 --> 01:01:27,200
A few quiet words of encouragement
would soothe the ranks.

625
01:01:27,300 --> 01:01:28,700
Encouragement?

626
01:01:28,800 --> 01:01:32,000
- They kill civilians by the buckets.
- They went a bit far, I know,

627
01:01:32,100 --> 01:01:35,700
but they have given us real momentum.
The Brits are on the ropes.

628
01:01:35,800 --> 01:01:39,900
Jesus Christ, I said hit
a few financial targets. That's it.

629
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:43,000
No one gets hurt.
That's what we agreed to.

630
01:01:43,100 --> 01:01:46,000
- You gave me your word.
- And by God, I kept it.

631
01:01:46,100 --> 01:01:49,400
I don't know who they are,
don't even know who's controlling 'em.

632
01:01:49,500 --> 01:01:51,200
And that's the way it has to be.

633
01:01:51,300 --> 01:01:54,200
Because if something goes wrong,
they could trace'em straight back to us.

634
01:01:54,300 --> 01:01:56,100
Go wrong? This wasn't
the fuckin' plan.

635
01:01:56,200 --> 01:01:58,300
I needed this
to get our people back.

636
01:01:58,400 --> 01:02:02,500
- You and I spent our whole lifetime--
- You don't give a shit about those men!

637
01:02:02,600 --> 01:02:05,400
You needed the bombings
to shore up the election...

638
01:02:05,500 --> 01:02:08,300
to prop up your weakness
in the ranks. Well, guess what?

639
01:02:08,400 --> 01:02:12,500
In the fog o' war,
plans fuckin' change.

640
01:02:13,300 --> 01:02:17,000
Now, I stood by you when
you put fire into the lads.

641
01:02:17,100 --> 01:02:20,200
M62, Aldershot, Mountbatten.

642
01:02:20,300 --> 01:02:22,900
You were calling for an escalation
then right enough.

643
01:02:23,000 --> 01:02:25,200
Those days are long gone!

644
01:02:26,100 --> 01:02:29,000
That's not what I heard
a few months ago.

645
01:02:29,900 --> 01:02:31,800
I heard the old Liam,

646
01:02:31,900 --> 01:02:34,900
a man back on track
with a plan.

647
01:02:37,200 --> 01:02:40,200
You haven't forgotten what
we're fighting for, have you?

648
01:02:40,400 --> 01:02:42,300
You question my loyalty?

649
01:02:42,600 --> 01:02:44,400
I buried my brother-in-law,

650
01:02:44,500 --> 01:02:46,800
before that my dad
and my two cousins.

651
01:02:46,900 --> 01:02:50,200
We split our fair share of blood
struggling for a united Ireland...

652
01:02:50,300 --> 01:02:52,300
not profiting off a divided one.

653
01:02:52,400 --> 01:02:55,800
So don't fucking go asking me again if
I've forgotten what we're fighting for.

654
01:02:55,900 --> 01:02:58,300
If there's anyone profiteering
around here, it's you...

655
01:02:58,400 --> 01:03:03,200
sitting in your fancy houses,
cozying up to the Brits.

656
01:03:03,300 --> 01:03:06,800
- You're not the Liam I once knew.
- You want the old me, huh?

657
01:03:06,900 --> 01:03:09,500
The Butcher of the Bogside,
is that what you want?

658
01:03:09,600 --> 01:03:10,700
Well then hear this.

659
01:03:10,800 --> 01:03:13,200
You reel in those
fuckin' cunt and end it,

660
01:03:13,300 --> 01:03:16,200
or by God, I'll bury
the lot of yas.

661
01:03:17,700 --> 01:03:20,400
Right, I'm going now.

662
01:03:21,200 --> 01:03:23,500
I'll be at my farm
if you need me.

663
01:03:24,109 --> 01:03:26,500
And take care of that
Committee issue.

664
01:03:26,600 --> 01:03:30,600
We don't want them jumping to the
wrong conclusion about that Semtex.

665
01:03:30,700 --> 01:03:32,000
Do we?

666
01:03:42,500 --> 01:03:45,500
Do you or any of the men know
where Mary's staying in London?

667
01:03:45,600 --> 01:03:47,800
No. No one but Murphy.

668
01:03:47,900 --> 01:03:50,000
McGrath knows where she's hiding.

669
01:03:51,100 --> 01:03:53,100
I wanna know how.

670
01:04:12,900 --> 01:04:14,700
What a day, Charlie.

671
01:04:15,300 --> 01:04:18,400
What a day.
Come on now, let's go.

672
01:04:23,200 --> 01:04:25,300
Come on, Charlie! Up you get.

673
01:04:25,600 --> 01:04:27,200
Charlie!

674
01:04:58,600 --> 01:05:00,200
You killed my dog.

675
01:05:00,300 --> 01:05:02,600
Dog's fine. Just sleeping.

676
01:05:03,400 --> 01:05:04,600
Sit.

677
01:05:13,500 --> 01:05:15,300
I'm wearing a bomb.

678
01:05:15,400 --> 01:05:19,400
Anyone comes in,
I touch it one, then we die.

679
01:05:20,200 --> 01:05:23,100
- Now, give me the names.
- They claim to be UDI,

680
01:05:23,200 --> 01:05:25,200
but I don't know
who they really are.

681
01:05:25,300 --> 01:05:27,900
I'm doing everything I can
to find out who's responsible.

682
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:32,600
- You are lying! Who killed my daughter?
- I'm sorry. I truly don't know yet.

683
01:05:38,700 --> 01:05:41,800
The explosives the bombers use,
it's Semtex-H?

684
01:05:41,900 --> 01:05:45,600
Yes. Yes.
You know about Semtex?

685
01:05:46,200 --> 01:05:48,100
I know Semtex-H.

686
01:05:48,200 --> 01:05:50,700
During the war,
Czechs make for the army.

687
01:05:50,800 --> 01:05:52,600
Good for bombs and traps.

688
01:05:52,700 --> 01:05:54,800
- In Vietnam?
- Yes.

689
01:05:55,100 --> 01:05:58,000
Many American people
died by Semtex-H.

690
01:05:58,100 --> 01:06:01,100
Now, UDI use
to kill my daughter.

691
01:06:02,018 --> 01:06:03,800
That's ironic.

692
01:06:04,200 --> 01:06:06,000
I've read your history.

693
01:06:06,100 --> 01:06:08,000
We both know what war is.

694
01:06:08,300 --> 01:06:12,000
We've both tried to put it
behind us. You and me, we're alike.

695
01:06:12,900 --> 01:06:16,100
We are nothing alike. You are nothing!
You kill women and children!

696
01:06:16,200 --> 01:06:18,800
- Names!
- To Almighty God, I don't know.

697
01:06:18,900 --> 01:06:19,900
Wait. Wait!

698
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:22,100
I've set a trap for them
when they use the next bomb.

699
01:06:22,200 --> 01:06:24,600
When they claim the responsibility
to the next bombing,

700
01:06:24,700 --> 01:06:26,900
they'll use a code word,

701
01:06:27,000 --> 01:06:29,100
telling the police they're UDI.

702
01:06:29,200 --> 01:06:34,500
I've changed that code word.
So when they use it, I'll know.

703
01:06:40,900 --> 01:06:42,400
You have one day.

704
01:06:44,300 --> 01:06:46,800
What if they don't set off
a bomb by then?

705
01:06:47,700 --> 01:06:49,200
24 hours.

706
01:06:52,200 --> 01:06:56,400
Oh, Jesus. Oh, Jesus.
Sweet Jesus.

707
01:06:59,300 --> 01:07:00,900
We missed it the first time.

708
01:07:01,000 --> 01:07:03,300
But ran a reconfiguration
through RAPTOR,

709
01:07:03,400 --> 01:07:06,700
and the image's anomalies and
architecture became more apparent.

710
01:07:06,800 --> 01:07:09,700
Now there, look,
the back of his hand.

711
01:07:09,800 --> 01:07:12,000
Looks like a burn
or a birthmark.

712
01:07:12,300 --> 01:07:14,000
We're running comparatives now.

713
01:07:14,100 --> 01:07:17,008
So it's a bit more time,
but we'll get it.

714
01:08:40,500 --> 01:08:43,100
- Morning, Sean. Thanks for coming.
- Are you all right?

715
01:08:43,200 --> 01:08:46,000
- Oh, well, I've been better.
- There's been another bombing.

716
01:08:46,100 --> 01:08:48,400
- Yeah. I just heard.
- Aye, a London bus.

717
01:08:48,500 --> 01:08:50,800
- Has Bromley phoned?
- No, not yet.

718
01:08:50,900 --> 01:08:52,600
McGrath's on his way
with some locals.

719
01:08:52,700 --> 01:08:55,200
- They'll give you a hand.
- No, I don't need them.

720
01:08:55,300 --> 01:08:57,500
- I'll handle it.
- Good man.

721
01:09:15,700 --> 01:09:17,600
- Hennessey.
- They called.

722
01:09:17,700 --> 01:09:20,600
But didn't give a code word.
What the hell's going on?

723
01:09:20,700 --> 01:09:22,200
Maybe it wasn't them.

724
01:09:22,500 --> 01:09:24,400
Press Association took the call.

725
01:09:24,500 --> 01:09:27,400
A man with an Irish accent said
there'd be no more fuckin' cooperation...

726
01:09:27,500 --> 01:09:29,400
with the Brits and
no more code words.

727
01:09:29,500 --> 01:09:31,800
He knew exactly which bus and
how much explosive was used.

728
01:09:31,900 --> 01:09:33,900
And it's been ID'd
as your Semtex again.

729
01:09:34,000 --> 01:09:37,500
Either someone talked, warned
them out, or you're playing me.

730
01:09:37,600 --> 01:09:40,000
Only two people knew
what was happening.

731
01:09:40,100 --> 01:09:42,700
Myself and Morrison.

732
01:09:42,800 --> 01:09:45,300
Like I said, one of you
can't be trusted.

733
01:09:45,400 --> 01:09:48,600
Send me a number where
I can reach you day or night.

734
01:09:49,100 --> 01:09:51,700
I'll call the moment
I have something.

735
01:09:51,800 --> 01:09:53,200
It better be soon,

736
01:09:53,300 --> 01:09:56,500
or you'll feel a backash the likes
of which you've never felt before.

737
01:10:00,400 --> 01:10:02,100
A bus now.

738
01:10:02,200 --> 01:10:05,300
For God's sake, 16 dead,
twice that injured.

739
01:10:05,400 --> 01:10:06,600
I'm sorry.

740
01:10:06,700 --> 01:10:09,900
I had a plan to nail
the bastards. Didn't work.

741
01:10:10,500 --> 01:10:12,800
I've just come
from Downing Street.

742
01:10:12,900 --> 01:10:14,800
The PM will consider
the pardons,

743
01:10:14,900 --> 01:10:17,100
but only if you give up
the bombers immediately.

744
01:10:17,200 --> 01:10:19,500
And how in God's name
do I do that?

745
01:10:19,600 --> 01:10:21,000
Find a way.

746
01:10:21,100 --> 01:10:24,900
Plans are afoot to put paratroops
back on your streets in 48 hours.

747
01:10:25,000 --> 01:10:26,300
Belfast will erupt.

748
01:10:26,400 --> 01:10:29,400
You'll give the bombers
exactly what they want.

749
01:10:29,500 --> 01:10:32,400
Well, it's out of my hands now.
Call when you have something.

750
01:10:32,500 --> 01:10:34,400
I'm heading for a conference
in Rome tomorrow.

751
01:10:34,500 --> 01:10:36,500
I'll have my cell at all times.

752
01:10:55,000 --> 01:10:56,500
How was London?

753
01:10:56,600 --> 01:10:58,400
Is Mary okay?

754
01:10:59,100 --> 01:11:01,600
You said to keep an eye on her,

755
01:11:01,900 --> 01:11:04,500
and make sure she and Keri
were kept safe.

756
01:11:08,000 --> 01:11:10,100
I spent some time
in her hotel lobby.

757
01:11:10,200 --> 01:11:12,300
watching the comings
and goings, you know?

758
01:11:12,400 --> 01:11:14,800
She had no idea I was there.

759
01:11:15,600 --> 01:11:17,600
And your nephew turns up.

760
01:11:18,900 --> 01:11:21,100
He spend two hours in her room.

761
01:11:22,700 --> 01:11:25,900
- He spent two hours
in Mary's room? - Aye.

762
01:11:26,400 --> 01:11:28,200
And after he goes,

763
01:11:28,800 --> 01:11:30,500
Mary comes down,

764
01:11:31,200 --> 01:11:34,300
and calls Hugh McGrath
on the lobby phone.

765
01:11:56,100 --> 01:11:57,600
It's done.

766
01:12:02,900 --> 01:12:06,600
Unless they take it apart, there's
no way to know it's been modified.

767
01:12:06,700 --> 01:12:09,000
Fuckin' brilliant.
What'll set it off?

768
01:12:09,100 --> 01:12:10,300
The internal clock.

769
01:12:10,400 --> 01:12:12,400
I'll input the time
once we know the flight.

770
01:12:12,500 --> 01:12:14,600
There's a security conference
in Rome tomorrow.

771
01:12:14,700 --> 01:12:16,900
All the top MP's and security
people are flying there

772
01:12:17,000 --> 01:12:19,200
- on three lunchtime flights.
- Perfect.

773
01:12:19,300 --> 01:12:23,000
- What about our mule?
- Sara just confirmed he's going.

774
01:12:23,500 --> 01:12:26,000
We then ran the burn-mark
through the database.

775
01:12:26,100 --> 01:12:30,100
We got a positive hit on a
Patrick O'Reilly, age 29, from Belfast.

776
01:12:30,300 --> 01:12:33,900
O'Reilly had one prior for domestic
abuse incident three years back.

777
01:12:34,000 --> 01:12:35,900
Did two months in Hydebank.

778
01:12:36,000 --> 01:12:39,100
We entered O'Reilly into
the facial rec bank for matches.

779
01:12:39,200 --> 01:12:41,000
We got a hit.

780
01:12:43,000 --> 01:12:46,500
That's him in a Dublin pub
with a UDI member four weeks ago.

781
01:12:46,600 --> 01:12:50,100
It's a known UDI meeting place
we've had under surveillance for years.

782
01:12:53,300 --> 01:12:56,600
- And the other two with him?
- I was about to get to them, Minister.

783
01:12:56,700 --> 01:12:59,800
That and a woman we've just
ID'd at the bus explosion.

784
01:13:06,200 --> 01:13:07,600
Yes.

785
01:13:07,700 --> 01:13:09,800
Your mole's Hugh McGrath.

786
01:13:11,900 --> 01:13:13,500
Did you hear me, Hennessey?

787
01:13:14,100 --> 01:13:16,700
- Are you sure now?
- Quite.

788
01:13:17,700 --> 01:13:21,200
We've ID'd Knightsbrid's bomber
as Patrick O'Reilly from Belfast.

789
01:13:21,300 --> 01:13:23,500
Three weeks ago
Mr. O'Reilly was observed...

790
01:13:23,600 --> 01:13:25,700
meeting Hugh McGrath
in a Dublin pub.

791
01:13:25,800 --> 01:13:27,900
Where's McGrath and O'Reilly now?

792
01:13:28,800 --> 01:13:30,800
I do not know O'Reilly.

793
01:13:31,700 --> 01:13:35,600
- I haven't seen McGrath.
- Let me help you with McGrath.

794
01:13:36,200 --> 01:13:39,900
His phone's GPS puts him
52 meters south of you.

795
01:13:40,000 --> 01:13:42,600
I'm watching him
coming up your drive.

796
01:13:43,000 --> 01:13:44,800
So let's cut the shit.

797
01:13:45,200 --> 01:13:48,200
There's a Chinook airborne
right now with a 12-man team.

798
01:13:48,300 --> 01:13:51,500
They'll land on your farm in
30 minutes to take McGrath into custody.

799
01:13:51,600 --> 01:13:53,800
I needn't tell you
how that'll go...

800
01:13:53,900 --> 01:13:56,700
now how your cozy relationship
with him will sink your career,

801
01:13:56,800 --> 01:13:58,800
This time for good.

802
01:13:59,900 --> 01:14:01,000
Or?

803
01:14:01,100 --> 01:14:03,700
Question McGrath your way
and get what I need.

804
01:14:03,800 --> 01:14:05,500
Names and locations of everyone.

805
01:14:05,600 --> 01:14:08,100
You can't save him,
but maybe you can save yourself.

806
01:14:08,200 --> 01:14:11,600
Thirty minutes. Get what I need,
I'll turn the around.

807
01:14:13,400 --> 01:14:14,700
Jim.

808
01:14:19,800 --> 01:14:22,500
Send McGrath's men
to the trailhead,

809
01:14:22,600 --> 01:14:25,000
see if Sean needs any help.

810
01:14:33,000 --> 01:14:34,200
Give me your phone.

811
01:14:34,300 --> 01:14:36,400
- What the hell?
- Give me your phone.

812
01:14:38,100 --> 01:14:41,300
Get your ass in that chair
there, you motherfucker.

813
01:14:42,800 --> 01:14:45,100
- A London bus, for Chrissake!
- Now hold on.

814
01:14:45,200 --> 01:14:48,100
Not even fuckin' warnings!
Sixteen dead.

815
01:14:48,200 --> 01:14:51,200
You stabbed me in the back
and sanctioned this bloodbath...

816
01:14:51,300 --> 01:14:55,100
- to get your war back on.
- The plan had no balls.

817
01:14:55,200 --> 01:14:57,500
This wasn't a Bombing
Light campaign.

818
01:14:57,600 --> 01:15:01,000
- We said hurt 'em, and hurt 'em we did.
- By killing women and children?

819
01:15:02,100 --> 01:15:04,200
You can't restrain yourself.

820
01:15:04,300 --> 01:15:06,600
You never could.
Well it's over.

821
01:15:07,400 --> 01:15:11,800
- Their names, aliases and locations.
- You know I can't do that.

822
01:15:13,700 --> 01:15:15,300
That's me being nice.

823
01:15:15,400 --> 01:15:18,300
Now write and it better match
what I already know.

824
01:15:18,400 --> 01:15:22,100
By God, I'll take you apart
joint by joint.

825
01:15:22,400 --> 01:15:24,100
You used me.

826
01:15:24,400 --> 01:15:27,700
You wanted the pardons
for your own political gain.

827
01:15:27,800 --> 01:15:30,300
You're a disgrace to the cause.

828
01:15:32,600 --> 01:15:34,400
Four men and a woman.

829
01:15:38,500 --> 01:15:40,600
- Maggie Dunn?
- Aye.

830
01:15:41,600 --> 01:15:43,600
You call her that.

831
01:15:43,900 --> 01:15:46,400
Sara Mackay is her real name.

832
01:15:48,900 --> 01:15:50,700
She works for you?

833
01:15:51,400 --> 01:15:52,700
Bloody right.

834
01:15:52,800 --> 01:15:54,600
Checks and balances.

835
01:15:57,900 --> 01:16:00,100
An insurance policy,

836
01:16:00,200 --> 01:16:04,400
if case you lose your nerve
which you have.

837
01:16:04,500 --> 01:16:07,800
So now, if they take the lads,

838
01:16:07,900 --> 01:16:11,000
she will lead them
straight back to you.

839
01:16:11,500 --> 01:16:14,200
Not so easy anymore now, is it?

840
01:16:14,300 --> 01:16:17,700
SO15 will be here
in 20 minutes to take you in.

841
01:16:18,300 --> 01:16:20,500
We both know that can't happen.

842
01:16:21,300 --> 01:16:25,200
You gave me up to the Brits?

843
01:16:26,100 --> 01:16:29,300
You tout bastard!

844
01:16:29,400 --> 01:16:31,200
You gave yourself up.

845
01:16:31,900 --> 01:16:35,300
They've got surveillance of you
in a pub with a Pat O'Reilly,

846
01:16:35,400 --> 01:16:37,800
who they ID'd as the
Knightsbridge bomber.

847
01:16:37,900 --> 01:16:41,200
And thanks to your GPS phone,
they tracked you here.

848
01:16:45,000 --> 01:16:47,200
You broke every rule, Hughie.

849
01:16:48,800 --> 01:16:53,300
And now I'm left to clean up your mess,
as I have for the past 30 years.

850
01:16:57,900 --> 01:16:59,500
A final thing.

851
01:17:01,400 --> 01:17:02,700
My wife?

852
01:17:04,200 --> 01:17:05,900
What about her?

853
01:17:11,500 --> 01:17:16,400
She hates you because
of her brother.

854
01:17:19,100 --> 01:17:22,500
So yes, I helped her...

855
01:17:23,200 --> 01:17:25,000
and she helped me.

856
01:17:48,400 --> 01:17:50,700
Oh shit, I'm late.
I've got to go.

857
01:17:52,700 --> 01:17:54,900
Did you cum?

858
01:17:55,600 --> 01:17:57,900
No. I'm not a three-second
wonder like you.

859
01:18:28,100 --> 01:18:31,400
Well, keep wearing that shirt,
I'll be a two-second wonder.

860
01:18:31,500 --> 01:18:33,300
You're gonna have
to get used to it.

861
01:18:36,800 --> 01:18:38,900
Practise, practice, practice.

862
01:18:42,100 --> 01:18:43,300
I'm close.

863
01:18:43,400 --> 01:18:47,500
McGrath confessed.
It was his op all along.

864
01:18:47,600 --> 01:18:49,400
I've got the bombers
names and location.

865
01:18:49,500 --> 01:18:52,000
I'll text you the info.
You may need it.

866
01:18:52,100 --> 01:18:55,200
The one who killed
Quan's daughter is Pat O'Reilly.

867
01:18:55,500 --> 01:18:57,700
He's got a burn mark
on his right hand.

868
01:18:57,800 --> 01:19:00,000
Either way, Sean,

869
01:19:00,100 --> 01:19:02,500
you end this, now.

870
01:19:03,300 --> 01:19:05,500
You hear me?
- Understood.

871
01:20:44,400 --> 01:20:46,500
- Yes.
- Bromley.

872
01:20:46,900 --> 01:20:48,500
I got your names.

873
01:22:32,100 --> 01:22:34,000
You know why you're still alive?

874
01:22:34,100 --> 01:22:35,800
You want the names?

875
01:22:38,100 --> 01:22:40,200
They're in the phone.

876
01:22:40,400 --> 01:22:43,200
The last text, code 7741.

877
01:22:45,000 --> 01:22:47,300
Five names and their
location in London.

878
01:22:48,100 --> 01:22:50,800
O'Reilly set the bomb
that killed your daughter.

879
01:22:51,800 --> 01:22:53,900
He's got a burn mark
on his right hand.

880
01:22:55,400 --> 01:22:57,100
You fought in the army.

881
01:22:57,400 --> 01:22:58,700
Iraq.

882
01:22:59,400 --> 01:23:01,200
Royal Irish Regiment.

883
01:23:01,800 --> 01:23:03,800
Two tours, Special Forces.

884
01:23:06,500 --> 01:23:09,000
You're Catholic, but
you fought for the British.

885
01:23:09,300 --> 01:23:11,800
- Why?
- I fought for the regiment.

886
01:23:13,100 --> 01:23:16,300
Out there religion didn't matter.
We are all the same. That's it.

887
01:23:18,700 --> 01:23:20,100
Family?

888
01:23:20,520 --> 01:23:21,900
A brother.

889
01:23:23,400 --> 01:23:25,200
The rest have passed away.

890
01:24:06,900 --> 01:24:08,500
Come in.

891
01:24:13,300 --> 01:24:15,100
Take a seat, Sean.

892
01:24:19,300 --> 01:24:22,200
Aye. You look like you've
been through the wars.

893
01:24:22,300 --> 01:24:23,400
Aye.

894
01:24:24,400 --> 01:24:26,400
Quan got the drop on me.

895
01:24:27,100 --> 01:24:29,800
I gave him the names, he took
my things and let me go.

896
01:24:30,200 --> 01:24:32,800
When the bombers called in
about the bus...

897
01:24:33,500 --> 01:24:35,700
they didn't use a code word,

898
01:24:35,800 --> 01:24:38,100
because someone
tipped them off.

899
01:24:39,100 --> 01:24:43,000
Only two people knew the reason
for the code change.

900
01:24:43,200 --> 01:24:45,400
You and me.

901
01:24:45,500 --> 01:24:47,100
Liam, I didn't
tell anyone, I swear.

902
01:24:47,200 --> 01:24:49,300
I spoke to Bromley,
and that was it.

903
01:24:49,400 --> 01:24:52,200
What if I told you,
I had Murphy...

904
01:24:52,300 --> 01:24:55,500
stay and watch Mary in London?

905
01:24:59,200 --> 01:25:02,100
- My own flesh and blood.
- Liam, I'm so sorry.

906
01:25:02,200 --> 01:25:05,200
I don't want to know
what happened in that room.

907
01:25:06,500 --> 01:25:08,700
All I wanna know is,

908
01:25:08,800 --> 01:25:10,300
what was discussed,

909
01:25:10,400 --> 01:25:13,800
when your sweet aunt Mary
was with you.

910
01:25:13,900 --> 01:25:16,500
Did she say she was involved
with McGrath and the bombers?

911
01:25:16,600 --> 01:25:18,100
No. Never.

912
01:25:18,200 --> 01:25:20,400
She was upset about her brothers
and kept on about that.

913
01:25:20,500 --> 01:25:22,400
When you and I were
talking about the code word,

914
01:25:22,500 --> 01:25:24,700
she asked about 'em but she
never let on about McGrath.

915
01:25:24,800 --> 01:25:26,600
Oh, so she could
hear us on the phone?

916
01:25:26,700 --> 01:25:29,100
No, it was only after our call
she mentioned the code word.

917
01:25:29,200 --> 01:25:32,700
- She thought they wouldn't be at useful.
- So she steered the conversation?

918
01:25:32,800 --> 01:25:34,300
Well, yes, I guess she did.

919
01:25:34,700 --> 01:25:38,400
- A good manipulator, she is.
- So she told the bombers?

920
01:25:38,500 --> 01:25:40,900
She told McGrath
and McGrath to them.

921
01:25:41,200 --> 01:25:43,500
Thick as thieves, they were.

922
01:25:43,600 --> 01:25:46,700
She tricked the information
out of you, Sean.

923
01:25:47,700 --> 01:25:49,800
She used you.

924
01:25:50,200 --> 01:25:52,100
- Liam, I--
- Shut up.

925
01:26:04,100 --> 01:26:06,400
Bury that pig in the sow-pen.

926
01:26:07,600 --> 01:26:10,500
And after that I have
one final task for you.

927
01:26:11,400 --> 01:26:13,300
And when that's done,

928
01:26:15,500 --> 01:26:18,400
go back to New York, son.

929
01:26:46,100 --> 01:26:47,500
Thank you.

930
01:26:56,500 --> 01:26:58,300
Zero, this is Alpha Two.

931
01:26:58,400 --> 01:27:00,400
Echo One toward target house.

932
01:27:00,500 --> 01:27:03,400
Zero. Echo One's towards
the target house. Copy.

933
01:27:03,700 --> 01:27:06,600
Echo One has entered the
target house and unsighted to me.

934
01:27:07,200 --> 01:27:10,400
Zero. Echo One is in the target house
and unsighted to you. Copy.

935
01:27:10,500 --> 01:27:12,500
Thank Christ for that.

936
01:27:13,000 --> 01:27:16,400
Sierra call signs. Confirm when
Echo One is complete in target house.

937
01:27:16,500 --> 01:27:18,400
Sierra Two, Roger that.

938
01:27:19,600 --> 01:27:21,200
Sierra Three, roger that.

939
01:27:26,600 --> 01:27:28,400
X-Ray One on balcony.

940
01:27:33,200 --> 01:27:35,200
Echo One approaching front door.

941
01:27:49,600 --> 01:27:51,100
How'd it go?

942
01:27:51,800 --> 01:27:53,200
It's done.

943
01:28:00,500 --> 01:28:03,300
I have visual X-Ray One and
Echo One have left the room.

944
01:28:03,400 --> 01:28:05,500
All other X-Rays remain.

945
01:28:15,500 --> 01:28:17,100
Zero, this is Alpha Two.

946
01:28:17,200 --> 01:28:19,900
One unknown Echo and two children
entering the target house.

947
01:28:20,000 --> 01:28:21,400
Roger that.

948
01:28:41,800 --> 01:28:43,400
Next.

949
01:29:02,000 --> 01:29:04,200
X-Ray One entering living room.

950
01:29:05,400 --> 01:29:07,800
All X-Rays now complete
in living room.

951
01:29:08,300 --> 01:29:10,700
All call signs move to your
final rendezvous.

952
01:29:48,400 --> 01:29:51,400
X-Rays and Echo complete
in living room.

953
01:29:57,500 --> 01:30:00,400
We've lost visual.
Echo One has closed the blinds.

954
01:30:00,500 --> 01:30:02,100
You have control.

955
01:30:02,200 --> 01:30:05,700
Roger that. I have the control.
Standby. Standby.

956
01:30:09,600 --> 01:30:10,900
Stop, stop, stop.

957
01:30:11,000 --> 01:30:12,200
Wait!

958
01:30:16,500 --> 01:30:18,800
Sierra call signs,
report what's going on.

959
01:30:18,900 --> 01:30:21,500
I've two unknowns
at the front door. Wait.

960
01:30:23,200 --> 01:30:24,200
Yeah?

961
01:30:24,400 --> 01:30:27,200
Sorry for the bother, but
there's a gas leak in the building,

962
01:30:27,300 --> 01:30:30,000
and the gas man needs
entry for an inspection.

963
01:30:30,100 --> 01:30:33,400
Our gas works fine.
There's no problem.

964
01:30:33,700 --> 01:30:35,900
He needs to inspect
all the flats, regardless.

965
01:30:36,000 --> 01:30:39,400
He won't take a moment,
and it's an emergency.

966
01:30:43,100 --> 01:30:45,700
It's quite important, Mr. Upton.

967
01:30:45,800 --> 01:30:48,500
By law, I'm allowed
to use my own key.

968
01:30:48,600 --> 01:30:50,100
All right.

969
01:30:50,900 --> 01:30:52,600
Just a second.

970
01:31:04,900 --> 01:31:07,500
Come down when you're done and
I'll take you to the next flat.

971
01:31:07,600 --> 01:31:09,400
Thank you. I will be very fast.

972
01:31:18,000 --> 01:31:19,500
This way.

973
01:31:43,000 --> 01:31:44,500
Can I see the boiler, please?

974
01:31:44,600 --> 01:31:46,700
Would you mind putting
your bag on the table?

975
01:31:53,400 --> 01:31:54,900
Open it up.

976
01:32:06,100 --> 01:32:07,500
All right.

977
01:32:24,100 --> 01:32:26,300
All call signs,
standby, standbye.

978
01:32:26,400 --> 01:32:28,800
Hold your positions,
wait for my order!

979
01:33:57,500 --> 01:34:00,300
All call signs,
standby, standby, go!

980
01:34:12,800 --> 01:34:15,200
Get down! Get down!
Get down!

981
01:34:20,000 --> 01:34:22,500
- X-Ray down.
- What about Echo?

982
01:34:22,600 --> 01:34:24,800
She's alive, under control.

983
01:34:25,800 --> 01:34:27,200
Who has planned this?

984
01:34:27,300 --> 01:34:29,000
Go fuck yourself.

985
01:34:35,300 --> 01:34:37,500
What's this, eh?
Your next bomb?

986
01:34:37,600 --> 01:34:39,100
Go fuck yourself.

987
01:34:43,300 --> 01:34:45,300
Talk, you rotten slag!

988
01:34:53,600 --> 01:34:55,400
It's too late.

989
01:34:56,900 --> 01:34:59,500
Nine minutes it blows.
No time to land.

990
01:34:59,600 --> 01:35:00,800
What's that?

991
01:35:00,900 --> 01:35:02,600
A plane? Which plane?

992
01:35:03,600 --> 01:35:05,400
Which plane?

993
01:35:05,500 --> 01:35:07,200
Open her shirt.

994
01:35:12,500 --> 01:35:14,300
That is how it works.

995
01:35:15,200 --> 01:35:18,100
I ask the questions.
You answer.

996
01:35:19,000 --> 01:35:21,600
That's right.
Flight 136 to Rome.

997
01:35:21,700 --> 01:35:25,500
Passenger name Ian Wood.
Bomb is in his laptop.

998
01:35:25,600 --> 01:35:27,800
Set to go off at 3:00 PM, exactly.

999
01:35:27,900 --> 01:35:30,300
Ladies and gentlemen,
please be advised,

1000
01:35:30,400 --> 01:35:33,700
Flight 139 to Rome
has been further delayed.

1001
01:35:33,800 --> 01:35:35,700
We apologize
for the inconvenience.

1002
01:35:35,800 --> 01:35:38,300
Once again, flight 136
towards Rome...

1003
01:35:38,900 --> 01:35:41,300
Ian Wood!
Is there an Ian Wood here?

1004
01:35:41,400 --> 01:35:43,700
Ian Wood! Ian Wood?

1005
01:35:44,000 --> 01:35:48,000
Is there an Ian Wood here?
Ian Wood? Ian Wood?

1006
01:35:48,800 --> 01:35:51,200
Ian Wood! Ian Wood?

1007
01:35:52,800 --> 01:35:55,000
What is going on?

1008
01:35:55,100 --> 01:35:57,000
They're looking for someone
named Ian Wood.

1009
01:35:57,100 --> 01:35:59,900
That's me.
I'm Ian Wood.

1010
01:36:00,000 --> 01:36:01,100
Ian Wood?

1011
01:36:01,200 --> 01:36:03,000
I'm Ian Wood.

1012
01:36:03,600 --> 01:36:05,500
- Is that your laptop?
- Yes.

1013
01:36:07,200 --> 01:36:09,100
Move! Move! Move!

1014
01:36:09,400 --> 01:36:12,200
Get out! Get out! Get out!

1015
01:36:14,800 --> 01:36:18,800
Move! Get down! Get out!

1016
01:36:20,100 --> 01:36:24,400
Get outta the way! Get out!

1017
01:36:26,000 --> 01:36:27,400
Move!

1018
01:36:48,000 --> 01:36:51,700
She sad a gas man turned up
with an assault gun, a Chinaman.

1019
01:36:51,800 --> 01:36:54,800
Started shooting, killed everyone
but her, and then walked out the door.

1020
01:36:55,100 --> 01:36:58,600
- She said it was a Chinaman?
- Affirmative. About 60 years old.

1021
01:36:58,700 --> 01:37:00,900
Just got word the
device is neutralised.

1022
01:37:01,000 --> 01:37:03,700
Good work. Fox Hunt
is now terminated.

1023
01:37:04,000 --> 01:37:05,500
No loose ends.

1024
01:37:05,600 --> 01:37:07,000
Understood.

1025
01:37:17,800 --> 01:37:21,300
It's Bromley. I need an AP out
to all city-disctrict units...

1026
01:37:21,400 --> 01:37:24,100
from Wapping High Street to A1203.

1027
01:37:24,900 --> 01:37:29,900
Suspect an Asian male, 61 years of age,
5 feet, 8 inches, 11 stone.

1028
01:37:30,600 --> 01:37:32,400
His name's Ngoc Minh Quan.

1029
01:37:32,500 --> 01:37:35,500
He's armed and has
U.S. Special Forces training.

1030
01:37:35,600 --> 01:37:37,900
Use extreme caution.

1031
01:38:06,400 --> 01:38:07,400
Yes.

1032
01:38:07,500 --> 01:38:10,500
I was on the flight they
targeted to blow up.

1033
01:38:10,600 --> 01:38:12,800
Because of your timely
information, we stopped it.

1034
01:38:12,900 --> 01:38:14,800
I wanted to thank you
personally.

1035
01:38:15,400 --> 01:38:17,600
Thank God you're okay.

1036
01:38:17,700 --> 01:38:21,200
The bombers were
neutralized, even Sara McKay,

1037
01:38:21,300 --> 01:38:24,000
whom you called "Maggie".

1038
01:38:25,600 --> 01:38:29,600
She gave a reporter the bomb that was
to have been put on my flight.

1039
01:38:29,700 --> 01:38:32,100
She also carried out
the bus carnage...

1040
01:38:32,200 --> 01:38:36,900
and is directly connected
to you... and McGrath.

1041
01:38:37,200 --> 01:38:40,300
We have call-pens going to
and from her off the cell towers...

1042
01:38:40,400 --> 01:38:44,700
by your farm and town homes. That's 250
precision locations and activitions...

1043
01:38:44,800 --> 01:38:47,100
- consistent with your mutual
activities. - Katherine--

1044
01:38:47,200 --> 01:38:50,300
I've spoken to the PM, he's agreed
to keep you in office for now.

1045
01:38:50,400 --> 01:38:53,300
I'm issuing pardons for five
"On-the-runs", one is your cousin,

1046
01:38:53,400 --> 01:38:57,100
but make no mistake Deputy First
Minister, you are now ours.

1047
01:38:58,200 --> 01:39:00,400
I say jump, you say where.

1048
01:39:00,600 --> 01:39:02,600
You're on the next flight
back to London.

1049
01:39:02,700 --> 01:39:06,000
Tomorrow, you'll brief SO15
and myself on everything you know.

1050
01:39:07,000 --> 01:39:08,700
All of it.

1051
01:39:58,800 --> 01:40:00,300
Evening, Sir.

1052
01:40:38,800 --> 01:40:40,600
How did you find me?

1053
01:40:41,500 --> 01:40:44,000
I gave you the names,
like I said.

1054
01:40:47,500 --> 01:40:50,000
This woman, she's a bomber.

1055
01:40:50,100 --> 01:40:52,500
You lie. You plan everything.

1056
01:40:53,500 --> 01:40:55,500
For whatever it's worth...

1057
01:40:56,600 --> 01:40:59,600
I never intended
to hurt your daughter.

1058
01:40:59,900 --> 01:41:01,900
Or any of those people.

1059
01:41:04,600 --> 01:41:06,000
Send.

1060
01:41:07,900 --> 01:41:09,200
Do it!

1061
01:41:24,800 --> 01:41:28,000
It's now on the internet,
you and your mistress.

1062
01:41:28,300 --> 01:41:31,300
The whole world will know
you are a terrorist.

1063
01:41:33,600 --> 01:41:35,500
Goodbye, Mr. Hennessey.

1064
01:42:54,600 --> 01:42:57,700
It's Landesman, Sir, in S-11.
I've got him.

1065
01:42:57,800 --> 01:43:00,900
He's returned.
The Happy Peacock Takeaway.

1066
01:43:01,300 --> 01:43:03,000
Do we shoot to kill?

1067
01:43:08,800 --> 01:43:10,300
Yes, Sir.

1068
01:43:12,100 --> 01:43:14,000
Sierra Two, roger that.

1069
01:43:15,300 --> 01:43:17,500
I believe we owe
this chap something.

1070
01:43:17,600 --> 01:43:19,700
This Chinese man
won't give up.

1071
01:43:20,100 --> 01:43:21,800
Keep back for now.

1072
01:43:21,900 --> 01:43:23,600
No point waking the dragon.

1073
01:43:23,700 --> 01:43:25,200
Yes, sir.

1074
01:43:26,100 --> 01:43:31,100
