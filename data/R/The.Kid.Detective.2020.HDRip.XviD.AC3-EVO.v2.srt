00:01:34,687 --> 00:01:36,123
Hello?

3
00:01:36,256 --> 00:01:37,992
Are you still in bed?

4
00:01:38,125 --> 00:01:39,893
No. I've been up for a while.

5
00:01:51,372 --> 00:01:53,307
Hey, man.

6
00:02:07,388 --> 00:02:10,157
Hey. We brought you
some groceries.

7
00:02:10,290 --> 00:02:12,426
- Thanks.
- Jesus.

8
00:02:14,128 --> 00:02:15,496
I know. It's not me.

9
00:02:23,669 --> 00:02:24,570
So, what's new?

10
00:02:27,041 --> 00:02:30,576
Your, uh, mom's biopsy
came back benign.

11
00:02:30,710 --> 00:02:31,811
Really? Cool.

12
00:02:34,081 --> 00:02:37,384
You should go get your moles
checked out too.

13
00:02:37,518 --> 00:02:38,818
Yeah, definitely.

14
00:02:41,989 --> 00:02:43,390
How are your finances?

15
00:02:43,524 --> 00:02:44,757
They're okay.

16
00:02:44,892 --> 00:02:46,894
- Credit card?
- It could be worse.

17
00:02:47,027 --> 00:02:49,629
Because you know we're not
bailing you out again.

18
00:02:49,762 --> 00:02:51,098
I had a big case last week.

19
00:02:51,231 --> 00:02:53,000
Really? What was it?

20
00:02:53,133 --> 00:02:55,601
You know I'm not supposed
to talk about that stuff.

21
00:02:59,672 --> 00:03:03,709
This gay guy wanted me to find
out whether another guy was gay.

22
00:03:06,579 --> 00:03:07,780
Was he?

23
00:03:07,915 --> 00:03:09,950
Yeah, a little bit.

24
00:03:11,351 --> 00:03:13,753
Oh, that's nice.

25
00:03:23,663 --> 00:03:25,399
What's on your mind, Abe?

26
00:03:25,532 --> 00:03:28,435
Should I be worried
if my pee smells like fish?

27
00:03:28,569 --> 00:03:30,636
Yeah, maybe.

28
00:03:30,770 --> 00:03:33,474
You know Rory Beans is
in the back, right?

29
00:03:33,606 --> 00:03:34,807
So what?

30
00:03:36,642 --> 00:03:38,579
Just leave, man.

31
00:03:38,711 --> 00:03:40,347
We're not gonna judge you.

32
00:03:52,792 --> 00:03:54,361
I used to be loved.

33
00:03:56,096 --> 00:03:57,998
I used to be a kid detective.

34
00:04:00,134 --> 00:04:01,634
When I was 13,
I solved the case

35
00:04:01,767 --> 00:04:04,538
of the missing
fundraiser money.

36
00:04:04,670 --> 00:04:07,541
It was Rory Beans,
the neighborhood knucklehead.

37
00:04:07,673 --> 00:04:09,476
Get him, Rory.

38
00:04:14,314 --> 00:04:17,451
In the beginning, I ran
my trade out of a tree house.

39
00:04:17,584 --> 00:04:20,354
Somebody stole the
basketball magazines from my desk.

40
00:04:20,487 --> 00:04:22,523
Can you remember
what else was in the cubby?

41
00:04:22,655 --> 00:04:25,192
My pencils, erasers,
some peanut butter cups,

42
00:04:25,325 --> 00:04:26,493
a photo of my bird.

43
00:04:26,627 --> 00:04:28,861
But nothing else was taken?

44
00:04:30,597 --> 00:04:32,798
- It was Clive Cunningham.
- How do you know?

45
00:04:32,933 --> 00:04:37,137
- He's allergic to peanuts.
- Wow, thanks, Abe.

46
00:04:37,271 --> 00:04:39,306
Whenever we watched movies
as a family,

47
00:04:39,439 --> 00:04:40,873
I would always spot
the bad guy.

48
00:04:41,008 --> 00:04:41,975
It was the bald man.

49
00:04:47,014 --> 00:04:48,982
And guess the ending
in the second act.

50
00:04:49,116 --> 00:04:50,750
She poisoned his drink.

51
00:04:50,884 --> 00:04:53,020
This isn't mine.
Mine was bourbon.

52
00:04:53,153 --> 00:04:54,854
It is. You saw me pour it.

53
00:04:54,988 --> 00:04:57,790
Seth used to be
nice, but now he's mean.

54
00:04:57,925 --> 00:05:00,227
I need you
to find out what happened.

55
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:01,895
Somebody keeps borrowing
my bicycle

56
00:05:02,029 --> 00:05:04,565
- without asking permission.
- I found this in the park.

57
00:05:04,697 --> 00:05:07,968
I need to know what it is.

58
00:05:08,101 --> 00:05:10,103
I noticed some blood
on my dad's car.

59
00:05:10,237 --> 00:05:13,140
I want you to find out
what happened.

60
00:05:13,273 --> 00:05:14,408
Are you sure?

61
00:05:23,317 --> 00:05:25,619
I saw that Constable Cleary was
in the yard again.

62
00:05:25,751 --> 00:05:28,255
He wanted to catch me up
on some of the latest cases.

63
00:05:28,388 --> 00:05:29,957
Oh, that's so cute.

64
00:05:30,090 --> 00:05:33,360
Son, we want you to know
how impressed we are.

65
00:05:33,493 --> 00:05:35,896
I've never seen a young person
take such initiative

66
00:05:36,029 --> 00:05:37,797
for the sake
of their community.

67
00:05:39,499 --> 00:05:40,800
I was 12 when someone

68
00:05:40,934 --> 00:05:43,103
finally chopped down
my tree house.

69
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:49,243
The town raised enough money
to set me up with a real office

70
00:05:49,376 --> 00:05:51,912
in the middle of Main Street.

71
00:05:52,045 --> 00:05:55,215
The mayor's daughter, Gracie,
was my secretary.

72
00:05:55,349 --> 00:05:57,618
I used to pay her in soda pop.

73
00:05:58,986 --> 00:06:00,753
Abe Applebaum's office.

74
00:06:00,887 --> 00:06:02,522
Oh, hi, Daddy.

75
00:06:02,656 --> 00:06:05,392
He's in with Principal Erwin.
Want me to take a message?

76
00:06:05,525 --> 00:06:08,895
Somebody stole a cashbox
from the school fundraiser.

77
00:06:09,029 --> 00:06:12,299
- What was it for?
- Animal rescue.

78
00:06:12,432 --> 00:06:14,635
Rory Beans was bit
by a dog last summer.

79
00:06:14,767 --> 00:06:17,738
Someone's been sneaking up the
clock tower, changing the time.

80
00:06:17,870 --> 00:06:19,239
Sounds like the Red Shoe Gang.

81
00:06:19,373 --> 00:06:20,941
Don't you have
a boy on the inside?

82
00:06:21,074 --> 00:06:22,876
Not anymore.
He kept getting grounded.

83
00:06:31,551 --> 00:06:33,287
I was often
in one of those situations

84
00:06:33,420 --> 00:06:35,689
where you're looking
for evidence in a house,

85
00:06:35,821 --> 00:06:38,925
and then you hear the owner
come home so you have to hide.

86
00:06:39,059 --> 00:06:41,662
And it keeps seeming like
they're gonna open the closet,

87
00:06:41,794 --> 00:06:43,497
but they don't.

88
00:06:43,630 --> 00:06:46,099
And then you sneeze
and give yourself away.

89
00:06:47,601 --> 00:06:50,103
Oh, my God, that's adorable.

90
00:06:50,237 --> 00:06:51,871
Bill, come and look at this!

91
00:06:53,740 --> 00:06:55,309
One day,
while taking a stroll,

92
00:06:55,442 --> 00:06:57,344
it suddenly occurred to me
who had robbed

93
00:06:57,477 --> 00:06:58,879
Mr. Hepburn's candy store.

94
00:06:59,012 --> 00:07:00,846
I was awarded
free ice cream for life.

95
00:07:00,981 --> 00:07:03,383
- Here you go, Abe.
- Thanks, Mr. H.

96
00:07:05,719 --> 00:07:07,054
Good morning, Abe.

97
00:07:08,622 --> 00:07:09,656
Hi, Abe.

98
00:07:11,625 --> 00:07:13,327
As a reward for
all my hard work,

99
00:07:13,460 --> 00:07:15,796
I was invited to play drums
for Sharkwater

100
00:07:15,929 --> 00:07:17,931
at the annual fall barbecue.

101
00:07:20,033 --> 00:07:23,170
Sometimes I would lie awake
all night...

102
00:07:23,303 --> 00:07:25,972
and wonder if I was the
smartest person in the world.

103
00:07:30,977 --> 00:07:32,879
Oh, my God, I met
this super cute boy

104
00:07:33,013 --> 00:07:34,881
at the record store
last weekend.

105
00:07:35,015 --> 00:07:36,483
You're always
meeting cute boys.

106
00:07:36,616 --> 00:07:38,518
It's driving me
up the wall.

107
00:07:42,456 --> 00:07:44,691
- See you later.
- See you later.

108
00:07:49,629 --> 00:07:52,632
It's been nearly
two weeks since the abduction

109
00:07:52,766 --> 00:07:54,668
of 14-year-old Gracie Gulliver,

110
00:07:54,801 --> 00:07:57,671
and the local anxiety
continues to mount.

111
00:07:57,804 --> 00:08:01,208
I can't believe it. She comes
in my store all the time.

112
00:08:01,341 --> 00:08:03,744
Things like this
aren't supposed to happen here.

113
00:08:03,877 --> 00:08:05,779
The mayor and his wife released

114
00:08:05,912 --> 00:08:08,582
this emotional statement...

115
00:08:10,016 --> 00:08:11,651
- Hello?
- Hey, Abe.

116
00:08:11,785 --> 00:08:13,720
It's Mindy Martingrove.

117
00:08:13,854 --> 00:08:15,522
Oh, hi.

118
00:08:15,655 --> 00:08:17,958
I was wondering,
how much longer do you think

119
00:08:18,091 --> 00:08:20,527
it'll take you
to find Gracie?

120
00:08:20,660 --> 00:08:21,895
Mmm...

121
00:08:23,797 --> 00:08:26,266
Mm, I'm not sure.

122
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:28,068
My mom told me
not to tell you this,

123
00:08:28,201 --> 00:08:30,237
but we're all
really counting on you.

124
00:08:31,505 --> 00:08:33,640
I know you can do it.

125
00:08:50,624 --> 00:08:53,193
Constable Cleary
still hasn't called me back.

126
00:08:55,796 --> 00:08:58,165
Try and get some sleep,
sweetheart.

127
00:08:58,298 --> 00:09:01,401
You have to stop
torturing yourself.

128
00:09:01,535 --> 00:09:03,603
She knows
you're thinking about her.

129
00:09:36,736 --> 00:09:37,871
Hello?

130
00:09:38,004 --> 00:09:40,006
Where the hell are you?

131
00:09:40,140 --> 00:09:41,508
It's Sunday.

132
00:09:41,641 --> 00:09:43,510
No. It's not.

133
00:09:50,250 --> 00:09:51,384
Fuck!

134
00:10:07,467 --> 00:10:08,869
Morning, Mr. Ackerman.

135
00:10:26,853 --> 00:10:28,555
Hey, sorry I'm late.

136
00:10:31,458 --> 00:10:32,726
Who did that?

137
00:10:32,859 --> 00:10:34,828
Some idiot I got suspended
20 years ago.

138
00:10:34,962 --> 00:10:37,497
He stole fundraiser money
from the principal's office.

139
00:10:37,631 --> 00:10:39,065
And he's still pissed?

140
00:10:39,199 --> 00:10:41,468
His parents were about
to buy him a hunting kit.

141
00:10:41,601 --> 00:10:44,571
The widow Gulliver was here,
but she got tired of waiting.

142
00:10:44,704 --> 00:10:45,739
Is she coming back?

143
00:11:05,825 --> 00:11:08,029
- Didn't I just find him?
- That was a year ago.

144
00:11:10,664 --> 00:11:12,566
So you're worried
he's been hit by a car?

145
00:11:12,699 --> 00:11:14,067
If it was a simple accident,

146
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:15,970
someone would've called,
wouldn't they?

147
00:11:16,102 --> 00:11:19,072
- He's wearing his tags.
- We're coming up on Halloween.

148
00:11:19,205 --> 00:11:21,909
It's possible he was used
in some kind of satanic ritual.

149
00:11:22,043 --> 00:11:23,878
- What?
- This is Willowbrook.

150
00:11:24,011 --> 00:11:26,079
And you know
what kids are like these days.

151
00:11:26,212 --> 00:11:27,781
This guy in homeroom,
Henry Hooper,

152
00:11:27,915 --> 00:11:29,849
claims he was in New York
over the summer

153
00:11:29,984 --> 00:11:32,752
and practiced with the Mets.
I need to know if he's lying.

154
00:11:34,055 --> 00:11:35,522
He's lying.

155
00:11:35,655 --> 00:11:37,424
I have a $50 bill.

156
00:11:39,060 --> 00:11:40,293
Let me see it.

157
00:11:49,469 --> 00:11:52,439
Uh, butter pecan, please.

158
00:12:00,280 --> 00:12:01,214
Thank you.

159
00:12:24,905 --> 00:12:26,206
What's going on?

160
00:12:57,303 --> 00:12:58,638
Oh, good, you got my text.

161
00:12:58,772 --> 00:13:00,206
Nothing worse
than walking home

162
00:13:00,340 --> 00:13:01,474
with just toilet paper.

163
00:13:01,608 --> 00:13:04,344
Everybody knows you need
to take a shit.

164
00:13:04,477 --> 00:13:07,081
- I'll get it next time.
- Yeah, sure.

165
00:13:13,687 --> 00:13:15,355
Hi, is this Mrs. Hooper?

166
00:13:17,490 --> 00:13:20,127
This will sound strange,
but did your son play baseball

167
00:13:20,260 --> 00:13:22,395
with the Mets last summer?

168
00:13:22,529 --> 00:13:24,864
He didn't? Okay.
Thank you very much.

169
00:13:49,823 --> 00:13:52,026
There's a girl in your office.

170
00:13:52,159 --> 00:13:54,394
- What? Who is she?
- I don't know.

171
00:13:58,832 --> 00:14:00,300
What's the matter?

172
00:14:01,701 --> 00:14:03,938
I forgot
to brush my teeth today.

173
00:14:19,186 --> 00:14:21,521
Sorry to keep you waiting.

174
00:14:21,654 --> 00:14:23,289
- I was out on a case.
- It's okay.

175
00:14:23,423 --> 00:14:25,592
I stole a magazine
from reception.

176
00:14:26,927 --> 00:14:28,762
Some cool stories in there.

177
00:14:37,737 --> 00:14:40,573
- Lucy forgot to get your name.
- Caroline.

178
00:14:42,842 --> 00:14:45,411
- Can I fix you a drink?
- Uh...

179
00:14:45,545 --> 00:14:46,579
no, thank you.

180
00:14:48,481 --> 00:14:50,784
How about some water?
It gets pretty hot in here.

181
00:14:50,918 --> 00:14:51,886
Sure.

182
00:14:53,787 --> 00:14:55,488
Yeah?

183
00:14:55,622 --> 00:14:58,092
Could you bring Caroline
a bottle of water?

184
00:14:59,392 --> 00:15:01,528
From where?

185
00:15:01,661 --> 00:15:02,529
The store.

186
00:15:05,598 --> 00:15:07,734
Are you serious?

187
00:15:07,867 --> 00:15:09,836
- Yeah.
- It's okay, really.

188
00:15:09,970 --> 00:15:12,039
It's no trouble at all.

189
00:15:21,781 --> 00:15:24,317
So when's the last time
you solved a case?

190
00:15:24,450 --> 00:15:26,120
I solve them all the time.

191
00:15:26,253 --> 00:15:29,823
They just... stopped putting
my picture in the paper.

192
00:15:33,127 --> 00:15:34,128
Who's that?

193
00:15:34,261 --> 00:15:36,329
That's me
and Mayor Gulliver.

194
00:15:36,462 --> 00:15:39,532
Isn't he the one
who hung himself?

195
00:15:39,666 --> 00:15:42,169
He also founded
the potato festival.

196
00:15:47,107 --> 00:15:48,976
- I've actually been here before.
- Oh, yeah?

197
00:15:49,109 --> 00:15:51,644
About five years ago.
Someone stole a silver broach

198
00:15:51,778 --> 00:15:53,847
at my 11th birthday party.

199
00:15:53,981 --> 00:15:55,548
You solved it
in less than an hour.

200
00:15:55,682 --> 00:15:57,151
Probably why I don't remember.

201
00:15:57,284 --> 00:15:59,552
You asked which of my friends
had the most cake.

202
00:15:59,686 --> 00:16:02,323
It's an old trick. When you
answer a question like that,

203
00:16:02,455 --> 00:16:04,591
your memory becomes
extremely selective.

204
00:16:04,724 --> 00:16:06,593
You're telling me
who you trust the least

205
00:16:06,726 --> 00:16:09,863
- without even knowing it.
- Cool.

206
00:16:09,997 --> 00:16:12,166
It only fails if you have
a really fat friend.

207
00:16:16,337 --> 00:16:17,637
Jesus.

208
00:16:30,017 --> 00:16:31,818
So, what can I help you
with today?

209
00:16:31,952 --> 00:16:34,587
I have another case I was hoping
you might consider.

210
00:16:34,721 --> 00:16:36,123
Of course.

211
00:16:40,361 --> 00:16:42,695
Somebody murdered
my boyfriend.

212
00:16:45,065 --> 00:16:47,334
- Seriously?
- Pretty seriously.

213
00:16:48,668 --> 00:16:50,670
He was stabbed 17 times.

214
00:16:57,278 --> 00:16:58,845
Um...

215
00:17:09,390 --> 00:17:11,892
- That's him.
- Hi. Sorry I'm late.

216
00:17:12,026 --> 00:17:14,295
- Your face looks better.
- Why? What happened?

217
00:17:16,063 --> 00:17:19,066
- He was in a bar fight.
- It wasn't like that. Here.

218
00:17:19,199 --> 00:17:21,467
It's an occupational hazard.

219
00:17:22,869 --> 00:17:24,138
When he was in high school,

220
00:17:24,271 --> 00:17:26,106
kids used to throw bottles
at the house.

221
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:27,640
Oh, that's awful.

222
00:17:29,376 --> 00:17:30,911
You reek of alcohol.

223
00:17:33,680 --> 00:17:35,615
How's the sleuthing?

224
00:17:35,748 --> 00:17:38,285
- Uh, not bad.
- You know, we really admire

225
00:17:38,419 --> 00:17:40,653
that you're still doing that,
sticking it out.

226
00:17:40,787 --> 00:17:42,622
It takes a lot of courage.

227
00:17:42,755 --> 00:17:46,093
You always knew what you wanted
to do and you're not giving up.

228
00:17:46,226 --> 00:17:48,095
You're living your truth.

229
00:17:48,228 --> 00:17:50,998
- Thanks.
- What are you working on?

230
00:17:51,131 --> 00:17:53,700
He's, uh, not supposed
to talk about his cases.

231
00:17:55,269 --> 00:17:59,206
Actually, I got
a pretty big one today.

232
00:17:59,340 --> 00:18:01,574
- Oh, yeah? What was it?
- You hear about that kid?

233
00:18:01,708 --> 00:18:04,411
The one they found in the river
a couple weeks ago?

234
00:18:04,544 --> 00:18:07,014
Uh, we were
telling them earlier.

235
00:18:07,147 --> 00:18:09,549
The police are getting nowhere
with the local youth

236
00:18:09,682 --> 00:18:13,020
so his girlfriend hired me
to find out what happened.

237
00:18:13,153 --> 00:18:14,854
- Seriously?
- Yeah.

238
00:18:14,989 --> 00:18:17,024
I did some work for her
a few years back.

239
00:18:17,157 --> 00:18:20,860
- What'd you tell her?
- I told her I'd think about it.

240
00:18:20,995 --> 00:18:23,364
You can't take that case.

241
00:18:23,496 --> 00:18:25,165
- Why not?
- It wouldn't be fair.

242
00:18:25,299 --> 00:18:28,235
- You don't have the experience.
- I've solved over 200 mysteries.

243
00:18:28,369 --> 00:18:30,070
How many of them
have been murders?

244
00:18:30,204 --> 00:18:32,439
You're taking advantage
of this girl's naivety.

245
00:18:32,572 --> 00:18:35,275
- She's not even paying me.
- Then what are you doing it for?

246
00:18:35,409 --> 00:18:38,212
Isn't this your job? Or are
you still working for quarters?

247
00:18:38,345 --> 00:18:40,014
It's like you've forgotten
who I am.

248
00:18:40,147 --> 00:18:41,982
- Who are you?
- Abe Applebaum!

249
00:18:42,116 --> 00:18:44,985
I solved the case of the missing
time capsule when I was 12!

250
00:18:45,119 --> 00:18:47,321
The mayor gave me the key
to the fucking city!

251
00:18:57,164 --> 00:18:59,665
Finally,
after all this time,

252
00:18:59,799 --> 00:19:02,369
somebody trusts me
with a real case.

253
00:19:03,703 --> 00:19:04,972
A chance to prove myself.

254
00:19:05,105 --> 00:19:06,974
You're telling me
I shouldn't take it?

255
00:19:12,246 --> 00:19:13,881
- Good for you, Abe.
- Stop, please.

256
00:19:14,014 --> 00:19:15,449
It is inadvertently
patronizing.

257
00:19:15,581 --> 00:19:17,850
I know you don't
mean it to be, but it is.

258
00:19:49,615 --> 00:19:51,385
- Heard of the Red Shoe Gang?
- Of course.

259
00:19:51,518 --> 00:19:53,853
Everyone knows not
to go near the Boiler Room.

260
00:19:53,987 --> 00:19:57,024
- What's the Boiler Room?
- Biker bar where they hang out.

261
00:19:57,157 --> 00:20:00,561
Oh, right, ahem. It used
to be called the Steamer.

262
00:20:00,693 --> 00:20:03,063
What does this
have to do with Patrick?

263
00:20:03,197 --> 00:20:06,066
Well, he was stabbed 17 times.

264
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:07,633
Usually when that happens,

265
00:20:07,767 --> 00:20:10,037
it's because you've pissed off
the wrong people.

266
00:20:10,170 --> 00:20:12,906
Is it possible he was involved
in something dangerous?

267
00:20:13,040 --> 00:20:14,674
- Such as?
- Drugs.

268
00:20:14,807 --> 00:20:16,776
No, he would never do drugs.

269
00:20:16,910 --> 00:20:18,579
- Gambling?
- No, he would never gamble.

270
00:20:18,711 --> 00:20:21,381
- Demon worship?
- He would never worship a demon.

271
00:20:24,684 --> 00:20:26,286
Tell me about his home life.

272
00:20:27,955 --> 00:20:30,790
His parents
were super strict.

273
00:20:30,924 --> 00:20:32,692
He had the highest grades
in our year.

274
00:20:32,825 --> 00:20:36,396
Is it possible the pressure
was too much for him?

275
00:20:36,530 --> 00:20:39,967
He was a good person.
He wanted to do well.

276
00:20:41,602 --> 00:20:44,304
In this line of work,
you learn one thing quickly:

277
00:20:44,438 --> 00:20:46,006
Everybody has secrets.

278
00:20:46,140 --> 00:20:48,342
No matter
how simple a case may seem,

279
00:20:48,475 --> 00:20:50,310
it's always shocking
what you find.

280
00:20:51,411 --> 00:20:53,514
I just want you to be prepared.

281
00:21:08,562 --> 00:21:10,430
Where do you wanna start?

282
00:21:10,564 --> 00:21:13,333
Shouldn't we
talk to his parents?

283
00:21:13,467 --> 00:21:16,170
I don't know.
That's a bit heavy, isn't it?

284
00:21:16,303 --> 00:21:19,173
Why don't we get
warmed up first?

285
00:21:19,306 --> 00:21:21,874
His friend Billy
works a few blocks away.

286
00:21:26,779 --> 00:21:28,848
His family runs
the butcher shop?

287
00:21:28,982 --> 00:21:30,984
Yeah. Why?

288
00:21:31,118 --> 00:21:33,053
I was working a case here
the other week.

289
00:21:33,187 --> 00:21:36,190
Really? What was it?

290
00:21:36,323 --> 00:21:39,059
Nothing that serious.
His dad might be a homosexual.

291
00:21:39,193 --> 00:21:41,128
- Holy smokes.
- Don't say anything.

292
00:21:49,169 --> 00:21:50,770
Hey, Billy.

293
00:21:50,904 --> 00:21:53,540
Hi, Caroline.
Who's this guy?

294
00:21:53,674 --> 00:21:56,009
Uh, He's a really
awesome detective.

295
00:21:56,143 --> 00:21:58,645
He's gonna help me find out
who killed Patrick.

296
00:21:58,778 --> 00:22:00,647
How many murders
have you solved?

297
00:22:00,780 --> 00:22:02,249
I have to ask you
some questions.

298
00:22:02,382 --> 00:22:03,951
I need you to be
completely honest.

299
00:22:04,084 --> 00:22:05,785
I know what it's like
at that school,

300
00:22:05,919 --> 00:22:07,554
drugs are more popular
than milk.

301
00:22:07,688 --> 00:22:10,524
To the best of your knowledge,
did Patrick have any contact

302
00:22:10,657 --> 00:22:12,858
with the kids on the stoop
or the Wild Geese?

303
00:22:15,028 --> 00:22:17,030
This guy has no idea
what he's doing.

304
00:22:20,267 --> 00:22:21,635
Yeah, well,
your dad is gay.

305
00:22:34,214 --> 00:22:35,781
Who else lives around here?

306
00:22:37,684 --> 00:22:39,752
Can I offer you
something to drink?

307
00:22:39,886 --> 00:22:41,255
Are those cupcakes
I smell?

308
00:22:41,388 --> 00:22:43,257
Sorry, they're for
my sister's class.

309
00:22:43,390 --> 00:22:45,292
My mom counted them.

310
00:22:45,425 --> 00:22:49,162
- Is it her birthday?
- No. She's just not very popular.

311
00:22:49,296 --> 00:22:50,664
Calvin?

312
00:22:50,796 --> 00:22:52,132
Come upstairs, please!

313
00:22:52,266 --> 00:22:53,799
Sorry. Be right back.

314
00:23:07,648 --> 00:23:09,182
What are you doing?

315
00:23:09,316 --> 00:23:11,251
It's an old trick.

316
00:23:11,385 --> 00:23:13,754
Always open a window
wherever you're invited.

317
00:23:13,887 --> 00:23:14,955
Why?

318
00:23:15,088 --> 00:23:17,224
In case you need
to sneak back in.

319
00:23:25,132 --> 00:23:26,199
What's the matter?

320
00:23:29,736 --> 00:23:31,571
Would it be easier
if she left the room?

321
00:23:31,705 --> 00:23:33,640
No, it's okay.

322
00:23:35,208 --> 00:23:37,511
Caroline, I know you think

323
00:23:37,644 --> 00:23:39,713
Patrick was
this perfect boyfriend,

324
00:23:39,845 --> 00:23:42,215
but he was
a lot more complicated

325
00:23:42,349 --> 00:23:43,950
than he allowed you
to believe.

326
00:23:44,084 --> 00:23:46,320
- What do you mean?
- Give us an example.

327
00:23:46,453 --> 00:23:48,689
He used to collect
bottle caps.

328
00:23:50,924 --> 00:23:53,026
- So?
- He had thousands.

329
00:23:53,160 --> 00:23:54,827
It was compulsive.

330
00:23:56,330 --> 00:23:57,364
Anything else?

331
00:23:58,765 --> 00:24:01,501
Yeah. He lied...

332
00:24:01,635 --> 00:24:03,603
about movies
he hadn't actually seen

333
00:24:03,737 --> 00:24:06,306
or books
he hadn't actually read.

334
00:24:08,108 --> 00:24:10,310
Everybody does that.

335
00:24:10,444 --> 00:24:13,914
He was very impatient
with handicapped people.

336
00:24:14,047 --> 00:24:15,949
Was he cheating on her
or something?

337
00:24:16,083 --> 00:24:17,884
- Why?
- You seem pretty determined

338
00:24:18,018 --> 00:24:19,219
to shit on his grave.

339
00:24:22,855 --> 00:24:24,524
I'm sorry, Caroline.

340
00:24:24,658 --> 00:24:26,693
You shouldn't have
found out this way.

341
00:24:26,827 --> 00:24:28,829
What are you talking about?

342
00:24:30,330 --> 00:24:31,398
He had a concubine.

343
00:24:33,300 --> 00:24:35,135
- What's that?
- Sort of like

344
00:24:35,268 --> 00:24:36,869
a second girlfriend.

345
00:24:37,003 --> 00:24:38,405
- Who?
- I don't know,

346
00:24:38,538 --> 00:24:40,607
but she sounded kind of wild.

347
00:24:40,741 --> 00:24:42,542
- What does that mean?
- He would brag

348
00:24:42,676 --> 00:24:45,078
- about the stuff she did.
- Such as?

349
00:24:49,716 --> 00:24:51,651
Uh...

350
00:24:51,785 --> 00:24:54,254
Put her hands on his penis.

351
00:24:55,722 --> 00:24:57,791
That's not so bad.
What else?

352
00:25:00,527 --> 00:25:03,063
Put his penis in her mouth.

353
00:25:05,065 --> 00:25:06,867
There are euphemisms
for these things.

354
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:09,069
Yeah,
but I didn't wanna sound vulgar.

355
00:25:09,202 --> 00:25:10,971
How do you know
he wasn't making it up?

356
00:25:11,104 --> 00:25:12,939
He had a picture
in his locker.

357
00:25:13,073 --> 00:25:16,943
- But you didn't recognize her?
- She was wearing a tiger mask.

358
00:25:17,077 --> 00:25:20,180
That's... all she was wearing.

359
00:25:21,548 --> 00:25:22,716
I don't believe you.

360
00:25:22,849 --> 00:25:24,584
I'm sorry, Caroline.

361
00:25:24,718 --> 00:25:27,454
I wouldn't say it
if I wasn't sure.

362
00:25:40,500 --> 00:25:42,904
God, those cupcakes
were killing me.

363
00:25:54,916 --> 00:25:56,616
So how long were you together?

364
00:25:57,885 --> 00:25:59,085
Three months.

365
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:01,923
But that's high-school time.

366
00:26:02,989 --> 00:26:04,926
So like six?

367
00:26:06,793 --> 00:26:09,029
I don't know. I...

368
00:26:09,162 --> 00:26:11,231
I thought he was different
from the others.

369
00:26:11,364 --> 00:26:13,099
Because he was a geek?

370
00:26:14,401 --> 00:26:15,769
He was cultured.

371
00:26:17,737 --> 00:26:21,441
I kept finding these
origami roses in my locker...

372
00:26:21,575 --> 00:26:24,277
on days when I had
a test or something.

373
00:26:24,411 --> 00:26:27,180
How'd you know
they were from him?

374
00:26:27,314 --> 00:26:29,816
He was the only Asian
in our school.

375
00:26:35,121 --> 00:26:37,858
I remember when girls still went
for the star quarterback.

376
00:26:37,991 --> 00:26:40,660
Nobody cares about football.

377
00:26:40,794 --> 00:26:42,863
God, this town got cynical.

378
00:26:43,029 --> 00:26:44,531
Did it?

379
00:26:44,664 --> 00:26:46,032
Look at this place.

380
00:26:47,701 --> 00:26:51,438
On Saturday night, this was
the center of the universe.

381
00:26:51,571 --> 00:26:53,340
They used to serve
breakfast for dinner

382
00:26:53,473 --> 00:26:54,608
and dinner for breakfast.

383
00:26:54,741 --> 00:26:56,176
Why?

384
00:26:56,309 --> 00:26:57,979
To be funny.

385
00:27:04,718 --> 00:27:06,653
Are you sure
you want to continue?

386
00:27:07,989 --> 00:27:08,990
Yeah.

387
00:27:11,157 --> 00:27:14,528
It won't feel real
until I understand.

388
00:27:14,661 --> 00:27:16,296
Then we gotta break
into the school.

389
00:27:16,429 --> 00:27:17,932
Why?

390
00:27:18,064 --> 00:27:20,001
I wanna look
for that photograph.

391
00:27:35,649 --> 00:27:36,951
Shit.

392
00:27:37,083 --> 00:27:38,752
What?

393
00:27:38,886 --> 00:27:40,720
They replaced the vent.

394
00:27:42,289 --> 00:27:44,926
There might be a window
open on the other side.

395
00:27:45,058 --> 00:27:48,128
- Why is that?
- Art class has been oil painting.

396
00:27:48,261 --> 00:27:49,931
- So?
- Mrs. August is pregnant.

397
00:27:50,096 --> 00:27:52,065
She might be more sensitive
to the fumes.

398
00:27:52,198 --> 00:27:54,267
Are you making fun of me
or something?

399
00:28:05,345 --> 00:28:07,080
What's that noise?

400
00:28:07,213 --> 00:28:08,916
Must be the overnighters.

401
00:28:09,050 --> 00:28:10,517
Who?

402
00:28:10,650 --> 00:28:12,385
You know,
the kids who hide out

403
00:28:12,519 --> 00:28:14,588
at the school
over the weekend.

404
00:28:16,156 --> 00:28:17,724
Good fucking God.

405
00:28:23,263 --> 00:28:25,298
This was his locker.

406
00:28:25,432 --> 00:28:27,601
- Shit.
- What?

407
00:28:28,735 --> 00:28:30,737
The cops already cleared it.

408
00:28:30,870 --> 00:28:33,007
Just a bunch
of fucking bottle caps.

409
00:28:41,082 --> 00:28:43,050
I still have his jacket.

410
00:29:24,457 --> 00:29:25,525
Here.

411
00:29:31,665 --> 00:29:32,699
Oh, gross.

412
00:29:36,137 --> 00:29:37,038
Oh, Jesus!

413
00:29:40,273 --> 00:29:41,541
Sorry.

414
00:29:51,152 --> 00:29:52,352
Oh, thank God.

415
00:29:57,557 --> 00:29:58,491
Huh.

416
00:30:00,593 --> 00:30:01,896
What the hell?

417
00:30:17,343 --> 00:30:18,311
Yeah?

418
00:30:18,445 --> 00:30:20,580
How did you know it was me?

419
00:30:20,714 --> 00:30:21,748
I didn't.

420
00:30:23,150 --> 00:30:24,885
Put me in touch
with your drug dealer.

421
00:30:25,019 --> 00:30:26,252
What? No.

422
00:30:26,386 --> 00:30:28,189
I wanna ask
about these pills I found.

423
00:30:28,321 --> 00:30:29,890
Why don't you ask
your drug dealer?

424
00:30:30,024 --> 00:30:32,258
We have a special relationship.
I don't wanna ruin that.

425
00:30:32,392 --> 00:30:34,929
So go talk to the kids
on the stoop.

426
00:30:35,062 --> 00:30:36,629
No.

427
00:30:36,763 --> 00:30:40,300
Why? Are you afraid
they'll make fun of you?

428
00:30:40,433 --> 00:30:41,401
Yeah, right.

429
00:31:02,756 --> 00:31:05,358
So that's the stoop?

430
00:31:05,492 --> 00:31:07,928
Technically,
it's a concrete divider.

431
00:31:15,268 --> 00:31:16,569
Check it out.

432
00:31:17,938 --> 00:31:19,305
What's up, Apple Bum?

433
00:31:22,776 --> 00:31:24,310
You know what these are?

434
00:31:30,251 --> 00:31:32,887
- Holy shit.
- Yeah?

435
00:31:33,020 --> 00:31:34,955
Answer my questions,
I'll give you some.

436
00:31:36,090 --> 00:31:38,259
They're called
Ego Boosters.

437
00:31:38,391 --> 00:31:41,128
- What do they do?
- Give you that extra nudge,

438
00:31:41,262 --> 00:31:44,798
if you wanna ask out a girl
or do some stand-up.

439
00:31:44,932 --> 00:31:46,332
They improve
your self-esteem.

440
00:31:46,466 --> 00:31:49,136
Looks like you guys
could use some.

441
00:31:49,270 --> 00:31:50,905
They also get you
super jacked.

442
00:31:51,038 --> 00:31:52,806
Why don't I feel anything?

443
00:31:52,940 --> 00:31:54,507
They take a while to kick in,

444
00:31:54,641 --> 00:31:56,776
depending on how insecure
you normally are.

445
00:31:59,846 --> 00:32:01,347
How much is this bottle worth?

446
00:32:01,481 --> 00:32:02,749
Like a grand.

447
00:32:02,883 --> 00:32:04,818
Great, now he's not gonna
give us any.

448
00:32:04,952 --> 00:32:08,621
Tell me who the supplier is,
I'll give you the whole bottle.

449
00:32:08,755 --> 00:32:10,291
Candy store.

450
00:32:12,358 --> 00:32:15,728
- Is that code for something?
- No. It's a candy store.

451
00:32:15,862 --> 00:32:16,997
Hepburn's candy store?

452
00:32:17,131 --> 00:32:20,134
Yeah. He's been selling
for years.

453
00:32:20,267 --> 00:32:21,969
- It's the truth.
- Just go in there

454
00:32:22,102 --> 00:32:25,005
and, uh, tell him you have
a headache. You'll see.

455
00:32:58,538 --> 00:32:59,772
What happened?

456
00:33:04,377 --> 00:33:07,081
Nothing. I told him
I had a headache.

457
00:33:07,214 --> 00:33:09,183
Okay, what happened next?

458
00:33:09,316 --> 00:33:12,086
I bought this ice cream.
It was too awkward.

459
00:33:14,088 --> 00:33:15,855
Here, I got you this.

460
00:33:16,924 --> 00:33:18,125
Thanks.

461
00:33:23,197 --> 00:33:25,832
I think maybe
those kids lied to you.

462
00:33:30,770 --> 00:33:32,605
Here comes
the kid detective.

463
00:33:38,312 --> 00:33:40,413
Let me go!

464
00:33:45,920 --> 00:33:47,720
Abe, stop!

465
00:33:47,854 --> 00:33:49,890
Who is the supplier?
Who is the supplier?

466
00:33:50,024 --> 00:33:53,060
The Red Shoe Gang! How long have
you lived in this fucking town?

467
00:33:53,193 --> 00:33:54,761
Make you feel big
to beat up a kid?

468
00:33:54,895 --> 00:33:56,397
Yes! These pills are awesome.

469
00:33:56,529 --> 00:33:58,865
Be careful.
They're super addictive.

470
00:34:07,908 --> 00:34:09,977
- What now?
- Take me to the Steamer.

471
00:34:11,278 --> 00:34:13,613
It's time to talk
to some adults.

472
00:34:25,225 --> 00:34:27,094
I'm here to see
Clive Cunningham.

473
00:34:33,100 --> 00:34:34,600
No peanut products.

474
00:34:34,734 --> 00:34:35,970
Right, sorry.

475
00:34:36,103 --> 00:34:37,338
Go ahead.

476
00:34:51,452 --> 00:34:53,686
We need to talk
about Patrick Chang.

477
00:35:02,463 --> 00:35:03,397
No.

478
00:35:16,709 --> 00:35:17,710
He wasn't there.

479
00:35:18,845 --> 00:35:20,280
What does that mean?

480
00:35:20,414 --> 00:35:22,615
We'll just have to work it
from another angle.

481
00:35:23,750 --> 00:35:25,718
Have those drugs worn off?

482
00:35:28,989 --> 00:35:30,357
Yeah, I think so.

483
00:35:43,736 --> 00:35:46,006
I don't know,
maybe we should call it a day.

484
00:35:46,140 --> 00:35:47,774
What's the matter?

485
00:35:50,444 --> 00:35:51,844
You realize
if I go in there,

486
00:35:51,979 --> 00:35:54,580
we're really gonna
have to solve this thing.

487
00:35:54,714 --> 00:35:56,016
Of course.

488
00:35:58,152 --> 00:35:59,719
It's just...

489
00:35:59,852 --> 00:36:02,755
I find that kind of pressure
can be counterproductive.

490
00:36:18,172 --> 00:36:20,773
I'm very sorry
to have disturbed you.

491
00:36:20,908 --> 00:36:25,512
I know how...
devastating and... And... And...

492
00:36:25,645 --> 00:36:28,916
And deeply confusing these
past few weeks must have been.

493
00:36:29,049 --> 00:36:31,919
It's, um...
It's beyond awful.

494
00:36:33,653 --> 00:36:35,122
Do you have kids?

495
00:36:35,255 --> 00:36:36,823
What? No.

496
00:36:36,957 --> 00:36:40,461
So, uh, you don't
really understand

497
00:36:40,593 --> 00:36:42,296
what we're dealing with.

498
00:36:44,264 --> 00:36:45,798
You're right. I'm sorry.

499
00:36:48,634 --> 00:36:50,437
It's been two weeks

500
00:36:50,571 --> 00:36:53,941
and the police haven't
offered any clarity.

501
00:36:54,074 --> 00:36:56,543
They're so preoccupied
with the physical evidence

502
00:36:56,676 --> 00:36:58,145
that they sometimes
can overlook

503
00:36:58,278 --> 00:37:01,381
the more complex,
psychological integers.

504
00:37:02,549 --> 00:37:04,051
- What does that mean?
- Uh...

505
00:37:05,586 --> 00:37:07,921
Do you keep a lot of fruit
in your kitchen?

506
00:37:08,055 --> 00:37:09,189
We used to.

507
00:37:09,323 --> 00:37:10,790
What did Patrick favor?

508
00:37:12,159 --> 00:37:14,760
When he was a kid,
he loved peaches.

509
00:37:14,895 --> 00:37:16,796
And in the weeks
before his death?

510
00:37:19,732 --> 00:37:21,335
He ate a lot of bananas.

511
00:37:24,538 --> 00:37:27,640
They're dry,
which means no mess.

512
00:37:27,773 --> 00:37:29,143
No plate,
no paper towels.

513
00:37:29,276 --> 00:37:32,012
You don't have to cut them up
or even wash them.

514
00:37:32,146 --> 00:37:34,481
You see where I'm going
with this?

515
00:37:34,615 --> 00:37:35,582
No.

516
00:37:38,352 --> 00:37:40,621
I think
he may have been depressed.

517
00:37:43,991 --> 00:37:45,993
Our son wasn't depressed.

518
00:37:51,064 --> 00:37:53,200
I found these
in his jacket.

519
00:37:53,333 --> 00:37:54,601
Open them up.

520
00:38:00,274 --> 00:38:01,707
They're called
Ego Boosters.

521
00:38:01,841 --> 00:38:05,512
Basically a mixture of coke
and who knows what.

522
00:38:05,646 --> 00:38:07,614
Someone must have planted them.

523
00:38:09,516 --> 00:38:12,352
To make it look like
a drug killing after the fact?

524
00:38:13,954 --> 00:38:15,489
It hadn't occurred to you?

525
00:38:16,856 --> 00:38:18,992
I'm open
to all possibilities.

526
00:38:19,126 --> 00:38:21,061
I realize
it's probably easier

527
00:38:21,195 --> 00:38:23,729
to solve the murder
of a drug dealer

528
00:38:23,863 --> 00:38:26,667
than a mild-mannered
honor student.

529
00:38:26,799 --> 00:38:29,570
But these
do not belong to our boy!

530
00:38:37,878 --> 00:38:41,181
Patrick was cheating
on his girlfriend.

531
00:38:41,315 --> 00:38:42,715
- With who?
- I don't know.

532
00:38:42,848 --> 00:38:44,918
- I haven't found her yet.
- How can you be sure?

533
00:38:45,052 --> 00:38:47,120
- His friend told me.
- His friend told you,

534
00:38:47,254 --> 00:38:48,622
and you treat it as fact?

535
00:38:48,754 --> 00:38:50,891
No, Patrick had a picture
in his locker.

536
00:38:51,024 --> 00:38:52,226
Which you saw?

537
00:38:52,359 --> 00:38:53,759
No.

538
00:38:55,229 --> 00:38:57,364
Are you a detective
or just some idiot

539
00:38:57,497 --> 00:38:59,865
who believes
whatever he's told?

540
00:39:01,568 --> 00:39:03,736
I've closed
over 200 cases.

541
00:39:05,706 --> 00:39:07,407
How many of them murders?

542
00:39:16,683 --> 00:39:17,750
Three.

543
00:39:26,826 --> 00:39:28,929
Then don't let me
discourage you.

544
00:40:03,764 --> 00:40:05,966
He was a very private boy.

545
00:40:08,035 --> 00:40:09,569
We didn't even know
about Caroline

546
00:40:09,703 --> 00:40:11,738
until she called us
after his death.

547
00:40:14,675 --> 00:40:17,978
It's difficult to accept...

548
00:40:18,111 --> 00:40:19,546
that you didn't know
everything

549
00:40:19,680 --> 00:40:21,882
when you've loved someone
so thoroughly.

550
00:40:24,418 --> 00:40:30,424
I promise you, I will not rest
until this case is solved...

551
00:40:30,557 --> 00:40:33,859
and your family finds
some source of peace.

552
00:40:33,994 --> 00:40:35,295
Don't promise that.

553
00:40:37,931 --> 00:40:39,433
It's silly.

554
00:40:44,471 --> 00:40:46,173
Can I hang on to this?

555
00:41:00,654 --> 00:41:03,123
- What?
- I think I found that tiger.

556
00:41:04,257 --> 00:41:06,126
Really? How?

557
00:41:06,259 --> 00:41:09,629
Social media. I keep telling you
to get with the times.

558
00:41:12,599 --> 00:41:14,167
Oh.

559
00:41:14,301 --> 00:41:15,669
Nice work.

560
00:41:19,506 --> 00:41:21,675
Hi, I'm looking
for Melody Miller.

561
00:41:21,808 --> 00:41:23,343
A little old,
aren't you?

562
00:41:25,879 --> 00:41:28,615
I'm a private detective. I need
to ask her some questions.

563
00:41:28,749 --> 00:41:32,819
Spare me the theatrics. She's
in the basement with her sister.

564
00:41:34,721 --> 00:41:36,056
Your mom seems nice.

565
00:41:37,624 --> 00:41:38,759
She's getting to that age

566
00:41:38,892 --> 00:41:41,661
where she thinks
she's too cool for me.

567
00:41:41,795 --> 00:41:44,197
- Who's Paul?
- Just some guy.

568
00:41:44,331 --> 00:41:46,333
Paid 50 bucks
to write his name on my face.

569
00:41:46,466 --> 00:41:48,235
Not bad.

570
00:41:48,368 --> 00:41:50,604
I can wash it off
in a week.

571
00:41:50,737 --> 00:41:53,306
How much was Patrick
paying you?

572
00:41:53,440 --> 00:41:55,308
It wasn't like that.

573
00:41:55,442 --> 00:41:57,411
Patrick and I had
very deep conversations.

574
00:41:57,544 --> 00:42:00,147
Oh, yeah?
What was perplexing him?

575
00:42:00,280 --> 00:42:02,048
He was concerned
about the environment

576
00:42:02,182 --> 00:42:05,352
and whether or not our distinct
identities are just an illusion.

577
00:42:06,888 --> 00:42:10,590
Impressive.
Ever have any arguments?

578
00:42:10,724 --> 00:42:12,526
No.

579
00:42:12,659 --> 00:42:15,529
So you weren't jealous
of his real girlfriend?

580
00:42:15,662 --> 00:42:18,999
She's just a kid.
Cute but uncomplicated.

581
00:42:20,867 --> 00:42:22,669
Did Patrick know
his life was in danger?

582
00:42:22,803 --> 00:42:24,604
Red Shoe Gang had
no reason to hurt him

583
00:42:24,738 --> 00:42:26,239
as long as he
kept his grades up.

584
00:42:26,373 --> 00:42:27,574
I'm not sure I follow.

585
00:42:27,707 --> 00:42:29,576
Everyone had to submit
their locker codes

586
00:42:29,709 --> 00:42:31,344
as a result of drugs
in the school.

587
00:42:31,478 --> 00:42:33,613
The principal could open them
at any time.

588
00:42:33,747 --> 00:42:38,485
So the suppliers had to recruit
kids who were above suspicion.

589
00:42:38,618 --> 00:42:40,487
So the nerds became
the new dealers.

590
00:42:40,620 --> 00:42:42,656
Whoever had the highest marks
in each grade.

591
00:42:42,789 --> 00:42:44,658
That's awesome.

592
00:42:44,791 --> 00:42:46,626
Everyone knows smart kids
have no spine.

593
00:42:46,760 --> 00:42:48,595
It doesn't take much
to intimidate them.

594
00:42:48,728 --> 00:42:50,697
- Have the police found you yet?
- No.

595
00:42:51,798 --> 00:42:53,133
Figures.

596
00:42:55,669 --> 00:42:57,804
Thank you very much, ladies.

597
00:43:02,642 --> 00:43:04,177
Thanks for waiting.

598
00:43:04,311 --> 00:43:05,846
I know this is weird.

599
00:43:09,316 --> 00:43:11,818
- What's the matter?
- That car.

600
00:43:11,953 --> 00:43:13,987
It was with us
at Patrick's house.

601
00:43:14,120 --> 00:43:15,856
No way.

602
00:43:15,989 --> 00:43:17,959
Do you think
they're following us?

603
00:43:18,091 --> 00:43:19,626
Let's find out.

604
00:43:30,670 --> 00:43:32,172
What the hell?

605
00:43:41,081 --> 00:43:43,183
- Try going faster.
- Okay.

606
00:44:07,474 --> 00:44:08,508
Okay, this is stupid.

607
00:44:09,944 --> 00:44:11,177
Okay, pull over here.

608
00:44:23,657 --> 00:44:25,692
Are you gonna do something?

609
00:44:25,825 --> 00:44:27,594
What?

610
00:44:27,727 --> 00:44:30,597
I mean, someone's
obviously following us.

611
00:44:30,730 --> 00:44:32,599
Isn't it safer
to know who?

612
00:44:35,335 --> 00:44:36,636
Yeah, I guess so.

613
00:45:07,701 --> 00:45:08,970
No way.

614
00:45:12,205 --> 00:45:14,976
- What the hell are you doing?
- We were worried about you.

615
00:45:15,108 --> 00:45:17,544
- Whose car is this?
- Your uncle's.

616
00:45:17,677 --> 00:45:19,779
- You're unbelievable.
- Are you out of your mind?

617
00:45:19,914 --> 00:45:21,615
We saw you walk into
the Boiler Room.

618
00:45:21,748 --> 00:45:23,717
How long have you been
following me?

619
00:45:23,850 --> 00:45:25,418
Since this morning.

620
00:45:25,552 --> 00:45:30,123
Get the fuck out of here.
I am working.

621
00:45:30,256 --> 00:45:32,492
Do you not understand
how humiliating this is?

622
00:45:32,626 --> 00:45:33,928
Wait...

623
00:45:35,128 --> 00:45:36,162
- I told you.
- What was I...

624
00:45:36,296 --> 00:45:37,497
You should have backed up.

625
00:45:37,631 --> 00:45:39,000
Why would I back up?

626
00:45:44,738 --> 00:45:47,074
Well, who was it?

627
00:45:47,207 --> 00:45:50,143
Reporters
for the local paper.

628
00:45:50,276 --> 00:45:51,946
- Really?
- Yeah.

629
00:45:52,079 --> 00:45:55,148
- What'd they want?
- Just to follow our crumbs

630
00:45:55,281 --> 00:45:57,384
and break the case
before we can.

631
00:45:57,517 --> 00:46:00,220
- It happens all the time.
- That's so cool.

632
00:46:03,490 --> 00:46:05,558
It's irresponsible
journalism.

633
00:46:06,693 --> 00:46:08,062
Oh.

634
00:46:35,522 --> 00:46:38,425
Um, I won't be able
to help much tomorrow.

635
00:46:38,558 --> 00:46:40,660
- Why not?
- It's a school day.

636
00:46:40,794 --> 00:46:43,064
The principal always calls
if I miss class.

637
00:46:45,832 --> 00:46:48,368
Your parents
seem pretty cool...

638
00:46:48,501 --> 00:46:51,005
about letting you
drive the car at least.

639
00:46:51,138 --> 00:46:53,140
That's because they're dead.

640
00:46:53,273 --> 00:46:54,975
I live with my grandparents.

641
00:46:56,944 --> 00:46:59,679
- Sorry. I didn't realize.
- I was really young.

642
00:46:59,813 --> 00:47:02,682
- How did they die?
- Downhill skiing.

643
00:47:05,318 --> 00:47:06,586
Oh.

644
00:47:08,089 --> 00:47:09,456
Both of them?

645
00:47:11,825 --> 00:47:12,960
Yeah.

646
00:47:13,094 --> 00:47:15,428
It was a very blustery day.

647
00:47:17,697 --> 00:47:19,666
In some ways, you're lucky.

648
00:47:19,799 --> 00:47:21,668
My parents
are always on my ass.

649
00:47:23,236 --> 00:47:25,039
Sorry. That was
really insensitive.

650
00:47:25,172 --> 00:47:28,541
I love my grandparents.
It's just not the same.

651
00:47:29,743 --> 00:47:31,244
They're pretty old.

652
00:47:32,679 --> 00:47:33,881
Must be lonely.

653
00:47:35,116 --> 00:47:36,416
I don't know.

654
00:47:36,549 --> 00:47:38,953
I've always felt like
there was this...

655
00:47:39,086 --> 00:47:41,421
other presence
watching over me.

656
00:47:42,957 --> 00:47:45,692
Do you believe
in that sort of thing?

657
00:47:45,825 --> 00:47:48,095
Yeah. Sure.

658
00:47:50,030 --> 00:47:51,431
Why not?

659
00:47:55,668 --> 00:47:57,804
Good luck tomorrow.
Let me know what you find.

660
00:47:57,938 --> 00:47:59,405
Sure thing.

661
00:48:11,384 --> 00:48:12,987
What are you doing here, Abe?

662
00:48:13,120 --> 00:48:15,688
You know you're not allowed
on school property.

663
00:48:15,822 --> 00:48:18,926
A man
just walked into your office.

664
00:48:20,794 --> 00:48:22,428
I know.

665
00:48:22,562 --> 00:48:24,564
I have the same problem.

666
00:48:24,697 --> 00:48:25,732
What do you want?

667
00:48:27,767 --> 00:48:29,970
To talk about Patrick Chang.

668
00:48:30,104 --> 00:48:32,806
- You can't be serious.
- His girlfriend hired me.

669
00:48:35,242 --> 00:48:36,543
Is she okay?

670
00:48:36,676 --> 00:48:38,344
All things considered.

671
00:48:39,746 --> 00:48:41,714
I don't think
it's really hit her yet.

672
00:48:45,152 --> 00:48:48,189
I'll help you with yours
if you'll help me with mine.

673
00:48:50,824 --> 00:48:53,693
One of the custodians found
some broken beakers

674
00:48:53,827 --> 00:48:55,862
in the science lab
this morning.

675
00:48:55,996 --> 00:48:58,865
Mrs. Hersholt noticed
some footprints

676
00:48:58,999 --> 00:49:00,700
on the floor of the gym.

677
00:49:01,936 --> 00:49:04,038
- What?
- Overnighters.

678
00:49:04,171 --> 00:49:05,738
Excuse me?

679
00:49:05,872 --> 00:49:08,242
Kids who stay at the school
over the weekend.

680
00:49:11,611 --> 00:49:13,981
How long has this
been going on?

681
00:49:14,114 --> 00:49:15,548
I don't know.

682
00:49:15,682 --> 00:49:18,418
Seems like
a pretty established subculture.

683
00:49:24,357 --> 00:49:25,960
So...

684
00:49:26,093 --> 00:49:28,561
what can you tell me
about Patrick?

685
00:49:28,695 --> 00:49:30,363
He was a quiet kid.

686
00:49:31,932 --> 00:49:34,701
Used to mouth
the national anthem,

687
00:49:34,834 --> 00:49:36,703
heh, as if we couldn't tell.

688
00:49:38,738 --> 00:49:42,042
- Is that it?
- No. Um...

689
00:49:44,078 --> 00:49:47,413
I was warned that he might
be mixed up in something...

690
00:49:48,648 --> 00:49:50,483
about a week
before his death.

691
00:49:50,617 --> 00:49:51,651
By who?

692
00:49:53,187 --> 00:49:54,854
One of his friends. Uh...

693
00:49:56,656 --> 00:49:58,424
I'm too old
to keep the names straight.

694
00:49:58,558 --> 00:50:01,228
Was he tall and ugly
or portly and pathetic?

695
00:50:02,997 --> 00:50:05,332
He was a bit heavy, yes.

696
00:50:05,498 --> 00:50:08,401
- Calvin?
- Uh-huh.

697
00:50:08,534 --> 00:50:10,971
I, uh, checked
Patrick's locker.

698
00:50:11,105 --> 00:50:13,806
I couldn't find anything.

699
00:50:13,941 --> 00:50:17,543
Another fight
in the girls' restroom.

700
00:50:17,677 --> 00:50:19,579
Who is it this time?

701
00:50:19,712 --> 00:50:21,081
Both Beckys.

702
00:50:23,816 --> 00:50:26,186
What am I supposed to do, Abe?

703
00:50:26,320 --> 00:50:29,890
These kids have
no concept of authority.

704
00:50:30,024 --> 00:50:31,258
I don't know, dude.

705
00:50:32,825 --> 00:50:35,695
Maybe there's more nobility
in just giving up.

706
00:50:37,131 --> 00:50:38,399
Maybe.

707
00:51:29,816 --> 00:51:31,484
Oh, wicked.

708
00:51:40,660 --> 00:51:45,232
"I only get one life, one body,
and I'm trapped in a teapot.

709
00:51:45,366 --> 00:51:47,834
"A harmless shell
with no hard edges.

710
00:51:47,968 --> 00:51:51,138
No one can see how much love and
violence I have inside my soul."

711
00:51:52,839 --> 00:51:56,477
Jesus Christ.
"How to make her understand

712
00:51:56,609 --> 00:51:58,278
"I'm the one
who really sees her,

713
00:51:58,412 --> 00:51:59,947
"who knows what she's worth.

714
00:52:00,080 --> 00:52:02,615
"Who would never
mock her innocence

715
00:52:02,749 --> 00:52:04,885
or take advantage
of her trust."

716
00:52:18,198 --> 00:52:20,334
That's motive, motherfucker.

717
00:53:17,024 --> 00:53:18,591
Hey.

718
00:53:18,724 --> 00:53:21,594
Can you turn
the music down, please?

719
00:53:21,727 --> 00:53:24,898
- What are you doing home already?
- Last period spare.

720
00:53:25,032 --> 00:53:27,834
- You want me to fix you a snack?
- No, thanks. I'm not hungry.

721
00:53:45,718 --> 00:53:47,187
Fuck.

722
00:53:53,393 --> 00:53:55,761
- Mom wants you to set the table.
- I'm doing homework.

723
00:53:55,896 --> 00:53:57,030
No, you're not.

724
00:53:57,164 --> 00:53:59,366
- I set it last night.
- Okay.

725
00:54:05,072 --> 00:54:07,941
Calvin, come down here, please.

726
00:54:08,075 --> 00:54:09,409
Little bitch.

727
00:54:56,722 --> 00:54:58,258
Where are you going?

728
00:54:58,392 --> 00:54:59,692
I need to pee.

729
00:55:40,367 --> 00:55:41,767
- Jackie?
- Yeah?

730
00:55:41,902 --> 00:55:43,503
You haven't finished
your potatoes.

731
00:55:43,637 --> 00:55:44,737
I'm full.

732
00:55:50,010 --> 00:55:52,379
What did she say?

733
00:55:52,512 --> 00:55:54,081
But I thought she liked Jake.

734
00:55:54,214 --> 00:55:57,551
- Time for bed.
- Okay, five minutes.

735
00:55:59,219 --> 00:56:00,654
Benji's an idiot.

736
00:56:00,786 --> 00:56:02,489
He didn't even know
what a kayak was.

737
00:56:09,429 --> 00:56:12,933
Mom, I'm scared.

738
00:56:13,066 --> 00:56:14,534
Of what?

739
00:56:14,668 --> 00:56:16,703
I think I heard
something in the closet.

740
00:56:19,573 --> 00:56:21,841
Come on, Jackie.
I thought we were past this.

741
00:56:21,975 --> 00:56:24,444
Too old for all this
monster nonsense.

742
00:56:24,578 --> 00:56:27,147
- Sorry.
- Go to sleep.

743
00:56:59,179 --> 00:57:01,014
That kid is traumatized.

744
00:57:02,349 --> 00:57:03,984
The family is furious.

745
00:57:05,352 --> 00:57:06,852
Did you explain?

746
00:57:06,987 --> 00:57:09,256
What the hell
was I supposed to say?

747
00:57:09,389 --> 00:57:11,358
That you're some
wandering mental patient?

748
00:57:11,491 --> 00:57:12,926
A private detective.

749
00:57:13,060 --> 00:57:15,195
She's 9 years old.

750
00:57:15,329 --> 00:57:17,464
I was investigating
the older brother.

751
00:57:17,597 --> 00:57:19,666
I got trapped
in the house.

752
00:57:19,800 --> 00:57:21,435
In connection to what?

753
00:57:22,602 --> 00:57:24,538
The Patrick Chang
murder.

754
00:57:26,872 --> 00:57:28,809
Who hired you
for a homicide?

755
00:57:29,842 --> 00:57:31,511
His girlfriend.

756
00:57:31,645 --> 00:57:34,881
- I hope you're not charging her.
- What have you found so far?

757
00:57:35,015 --> 00:57:37,184
I can't talk about that.

758
00:57:37,317 --> 00:57:39,553
It's an active
investigation.

759
00:57:47,160 --> 00:57:49,529
Why didn't you
call me back...

760
00:57:49,663 --> 00:57:51,565
after Gracie got kidnapped?

761
00:57:54,468 --> 00:57:56,036
Because you were 12.

762
00:57:56,169 --> 00:57:57,938
So?

763
00:57:58,071 --> 00:58:00,073
I'd helped you before.

764
00:58:00,207 --> 00:58:02,008
How would it have looked?

765
00:58:02,142 --> 00:58:04,244
The police chief consulting
with a child

766
00:58:04,378 --> 00:58:06,413
in the middle
of our town's greatest crisis.

767
00:58:06,546 --> 00:58:09,716
- You weren't the chief back then.
- Lucky for you, I am now.

768
00:58:13,720 --> 00:58:16,323
I'll see what I can work out
with the family.

769
00:58:16,456 --> 00:58:19,326
Convince them
to drop criminal charges.

770
00:58:19,459 --> 00:58:20,927
Thank you.

771
00:58:21,061 --> 00:58:23,263
This has to stop, Abe.

772
00:58:25,198 --> 00:58:28,368
Gracie was not
your responsibility...

773
00:58:28,502 --> 00:58:30,137
and neither is this.

774
00:58:31,738 --> 00:58:34,074
You can't run around
calling yourself a detective

775
00:58:34,207 --> 00:58:36,209
and expect everyone else
to play along.

776
00:58:38,111 --> 00:58:40,247
You know
I've always liked you.

777
00:58:42,382 --> 00:58:45,252
But at a certain point,
we've all gotta grow up.

778
00:58:47,421 --> 00:58:49,790
Maybe this is
that opportunity.

779
00:58:58,432 --> 00:59:00,667
Your parents
posted your bail.

780
00:59:39,573 --> 00:59:40,674
Hello?

781
00:59:40,807 --> 00:59:43,076
You finally made
the paper again.

782
00:59:44,912 --> 00:59:46,513
What does it say?

783
00:59:46,646 --> 00:59:49,850
That you were found masturbating
in a little girl's bedroom.

784
00:59:53,386 --> 00:59:54,956
I wasn't masturbating.

785
01:00:00,427 --> 01:00:01,862
I believe you.

786
01:00:13,373 --> 01:00:15,308
I'm really sorry, man.

787
01:00:15,442 --> 01:00:18,011
My friend really needs
to get in there.

788
01:00:20,982 --> 01:00:23,016
I believe you've been informed
by telephone.

789
01:00:23,149 --> 01:00:24,886
My brother has been murdered.

790
01:00:26,453 --> 01:00:28,054
It was the maid.

791
01:00:29,957 --> 01:00:31,993
When I'm investigating a crime,

792
01:00:32,125 --> 01:00:34,261
I'm not a man.
I'm a bloodhound.

793
01:00:50,810 --> 01:00:52,412
Thanks for coming, man.

794
01:00:52,546 --> 01:00:55,549
I've just been drinking
too much, you know?

795
01:01:29,583 --> 01:01:31,618
Hey. What are you doing here?

796
01:01:31,751 --> 01:01:33,955
I'm sorry, but you weren't
answering my calls.

797
01:01:35,088 --> 01:01:37,058
Uh, yeah, I've been busy.

798
01:01:37,190 --> 01:01:39,994
And you're not paying me,
so I had to prioritize.

799
01:01:40,126 --> 01:01:43,496
I found another paper flower
in my locker.

800
01:01:43,630 --> 01:01:45,632
- Okay.
- What do you think it means?

801
01:01:45,765 --> 01:01:48,970
That they were
never coming from Patrick.

802
01:01:49,102 --> 01:01:51,204
- What?
- Origami is Japanese.

803
01:01:51,338 --> 01:01:52,639
He probably just took credit

804
01:01:52,772 --> 01:01:54,574
because you started
talking to him.

805
01:01:56,776 --> 01:01:57,877
Oh, my God.

806
01:02:00,113 --> 01:02:01,581
I'm such a racist.

807
01:02:02,816 --> 01:02:05,019
Well, relax.
It's not that bad.

808
01:02:06,386 --> 01:02:07,821
Well, then who's making them?

809
01:02:07,955 --> 01:02:09,756
Probably Calvin.
He's in love with you.

810
01:02:09,890 --> 01:02:11,358
What? How do you know that?

811
01:02:23,370 --> 01:02:25,072
I'm sorry. I gotta go.

812
01:02:37,283 --> 01:02:39,686
Are you, uh,
ever gonna get dressed?

813
01:02:41,788 --> 01:02:44,190
- Why?
- I have people coming over.

814
01:02:44,324 --> 01:02:46,393
In the middle of the week?

815
01:02:46,526 --> 01:02:48,361
It's fucking Friday, man.

816
01:02:51,098 --> 01:02:52,133
For real?

817
01:04:02,235 --> 01:04:03,503
What the hell?

818
01:04:10,111 --> 01:04:11,244
What?

819
01:04:45,212 --> 01:04:47,014
- Caroline?
- Where are you?

820
01:04:47,148 --> 01:04:49,582
- I'm outside your place.
- You are?

821
01:04:49,716 --> 01:04:51,651
You called me
at midnight, remember?

822
01:04:51,785 --> 01:04:53,486
I did?

823
01:04:53,620 --> 01:04:56,056
You might have
to refresh my memory.

824
01:04:56,190 --> 01:04:58,625
You said you wouldn't rest
until this case is solved

825
01:04:58,758 --> 01:05:00,895
and my family found
some sort of peace.

826
01:05:01,028 --> 01:05:02,796
Remember?

827
01:05:21,481 --> 01:05:24,151
- Are these your parents?
- Yeah.

828
01:05:26,253 --> 01:05:29,023
- They're very photogenic.
- I know.

829
01:05:31,292 --> 01:05:33,693
- And these are your grandparents?
- Mm-hm.

830
01:05:33,827 --> 01:05:35,695
Where are they right now?

831
01:05:35,829 --> 01:05:38,265
Um, probably out
feeding pigeons.

832
01:05:43,037 --> 01:05:44,238
Thanks.

833
01:05:55,348 --> 01:05:57,117
I need to apologize
for the other day.

834
01:05:57,251 --> 01:05:58,384
It's okay.

835
01:05:58,518 --> 01:06:00,287
I'm sorry you had
to see me like that.

836
01:06:00,420 --> 01:06:01,688
I was in a bad place.

837
01:06:03,958 --> 01:06:05,458
I got arrested.

838
01:06:07,962 --> 01:06:09,562
I know.

839
01:06:09,696 --> 01:06:12,333
- You saw the paper?
- I went to your office.

840
01:06:12,465 --> 01:06:14,168
Your secretary showed me.

841
01:06:17,238 --> 01:06:18,705
What a cunt.

842
01:06:27,047 --> 01:06:29,649
The people in this town
used to look up to me.

843
01:06:31,484 --> 01:06:32,887
Even the adults.

844
01:06:37,624 --> 01:06:40,094
I was so far ahead
of the game, and then...

845
01:06:41,461 --> 01:06:43,563
one day
I just woke up behind.

846
01:06:45,332 --> 01:06:46,566
What do you mean?

847
01:06:49,402 --> 01:06:52,072
A few years ago, I heard
my roommate talking about me

848
01:06:52,206 --> 01:06:54,975
when he thought
I wasn't home.

849
01:06:55,109 --> 01:06:58,212
He called me a "detective,"
in quotes.

850
01:07:00,214 --> 01:07:02,715
I could hear him doing this
with his fingers.

851
01:07:04,985 --> 01:07:07,121
It's difficult to accept...

852
01:07:07,254 --> 01:07:11,258
the difference between
who you are in your head...

853
01:07:11,392 --> 01:07:13,127
and who you are
in the world.

854
01:07:14,395 --> 01:07:15,963
I know what you mean.

855
01:07:17,398 --> 01:07:18,933
You do?

856
01:07:19,066 --> 01:07:21,834
People act like I've never
seen a restricted movie before

857
01:07:21,969 --> 01:07:24,338
or stayed up
past midnight.

858
01:07:26,040 --> 01:07:28,775
Even my own boyfriend
saw me as this little girl.

859
01:07:31,912 --> 01:07:34,480
Don't blame yourself
for what that kid did to you.

860
01:07:36,216 --> 01:07:38,118
Experience is overrated.

861
01:07:39,852 --> 01:07:41,788
The world has
enough assholes.

862
01:07:44,224 --> 01:07:47,827
It's been a while since
I've known anyone like you.

863
01:07:47,962 --> 01:07:50,197
Reminds me
why I got into this business.

864
01:07:58,738 --> 01:08:00,441
Your clothes are ready.

865
01:08:33,974 --> 01:08:35,242
What the hell happened?

866
01:08:36,609 --> 01:08:38,711
I had some friends over.

867
01:08:38,845 --> 01:08:40,981
The door's unlocked.
What if a client came in?

868
01:08:41,115 --> 01:08:45,718
I wouldn't worry about that now
that you're the town pedophile.

869
01:08:45,852 --> 01:08:47,388
The phone's off the hook.

870
01:08:47,520 --> 01:08:50,523
I wanted to make sure
you were okay.

871
01:08:50,656 --> 01:08:51,724
Wow.

872
01:09:17,451 --> 01:09:18,684
What is this thing?

873
01:09:20,354 --> 01:09:22,289
That girl left it for you
the other day.

874
01:09:22,423 --> 01:09:24,091
It's from her dead boyfriend.

875
01:09:28,062 --> 01:09:29,463
Poor Calvin.

876
01:10:03,197 --> 01:10:04,965
I need the key to the garage.

877
01:11:06,593 --> 01:11:07,793
Wow.

878
01:11:18,738 --> 01:11:19,839
Hello?

879
01:11:19,973 --> 01:11:21,674
I need you
to stay home tomorrow.

880
01:11:21,807 --> 01:11:25,212
- What? Why?
- It isn't safe.

881
01:11:27,948 --> 01:11:29,849
They're not coming from Calvin.

882
01:11:53,739 --> 01:11:56,076
Have you found my cat yet?

883
01:11:56,210 --> 01:11:58,545
No. I actually
completely forgot about that.

884
01:12:01,114 --> 01:12:03,417
I'm here to talk
about your daughter.

885
01:12:17,730 --> 01:12:19,732
You preserved her bedroom.

886
01:12:19,865 --> 01:12:22,236
The house hasn't been touched
since Burt died.

887
01:12:22,369 --> 01:12:23,736
My parents just redid mine.

888
01:12:45,259 --> 01:12:47,160
Do you know
where this came from?

889
01:12:52,032 --> 01:12:54,501
She never said anything
about a secret admirer?

890
01:12:54,635 --> 01:12:56,336
Who could keep track?

891
01:13:00,840 --> 01:13:02,276
Is everything okay?

892
01:13:03,876 --> 01:13:04,978
Yeah.

893
01:13:06,846 --> 01:13:08,915
Nothing to worry about.

894
01:13:09,049 --> 01:13:11,151
Find my cat, Abe.

895
01:13:11,285 --> 01:13:12,986
I'm lonely.

896
01:13:21,361 --> 01:13:22,963
Everything all right, Abe?

897
01:13:25,299 --> 01:13:27,134
Yeah. Why?

898
01:13:28,335 --> 01:13:30,637
Nobody real
comes in before 5.

899
01:13:33,440 --> 01:13:36,276
My mind's running races.
I, uh...

900
01:13:36,410 --> 01:13:38,211
I need to relax.

901
01:13:38,345 --> 01:13:41,114
What happened the other week
with Rory Beans?

902
01:13:42,616 --> 01:13:44,351
He beat the shit out of me.

903
01:13:45,919 --> 01:13:48,821
- Why don't you just apologize?
- For what?

904
01:13:48,955 --> 01:13:52,159
No one forced him
to steal the fundraiser money.

905
01:13:52,292 --> 01:13:53,527
He didn't do it, man.

906
01:13:55,796 --> 01:13:57,397
What?

907
01:13:57,531 --> 01:14:00,033
Why do you think
he hates you so much?

908
01:14:18,585 --> 01:14:20,287
He stole the fundraiser money.

909
01:14:20,420 --> 01:14:22,389
- What was it for?
- Animal rescue.

910
01:14:22,522 --> 01:14:24,458
Rory Beans was bit
by a dog last summer.

911
01:14:24,591 --> 01:14:26,159
- Who did that?
- Some idiot

912
01:14:26,293 --> 01:14:29,062
- I got suspended 20 years ago.
- He's still pissed?

913
01:14:40,173 --> 01:14:42,843
Everyone had to submit their
locker codes to the office.

914
01:14:42,976 --> 01:14:44,745
I found another paper flower
in my locker.

915
01:14:44,877 --> 01:14:46,847
She never said anything
about a secret admirer?

916
01:14:46,980 --> 01:14:49,349
I've always felt like
there was this other presence

917
01:14:49,483 --> 01:14:50,450
watching over me.

918
01:14:52,719 --> 01:14:54,421
- Yeah?
- Hey.

919
01:14:54,554 --> 01:14:55,889
I need you to check the date

920
01:14:56,022 --> 01:14:57,457
on the first Rory Beans case.

921
01:14:57,591 --> 01:14:59,092
Are you serious?

922
01:14:59,226 --> 01:15:00,927
There's a chance he was set up.

923
01:15:01,061 --> 01:15:03,563
I might know who's
really making those flowers.

924
01:16:30,885 --> 01:16:32,452
What the fuck?

925
01:17:42,489 --> 01:17:43,523
Abe?

926
01:17:46,660 --> 01:17:48,628
I know you're in the closet.

927
01:17:53,333 --> 01:17:54,768
I'm under the bed.

928
01:18:04,611 --> 01:18:06,313
Why aren't you at school?

929
01:18:09,683 --> 01:18:11,117
It's Sunday.

930
01:18:15,488 --> 01:18:17,424
What are you
doing here, Abe?

931
01:18:20,527 --> 01:18:23,196
Do you remember the first case
you ever brought me?

932
01:18:23,330 --> 01:18:24,464
No.

933
01:18:26,366 --> 01:18:30,537
Somebody stole the cashbox
from the school fundraiser.

934
01:18:30,670 --> 01:18:33,440
That was the last year
we had one.

935
01:18:33,573 --> 01:18:35,943
I think I might have
made a mistake,

936
01:18:36,077 --> 01:18:37,877
implicated the wrong kid.

937
01:18:40,246 --> 01:18:43,450
Who cares?
Wasn't this years ago?

938
01:18:45,485 --> 01:18:47,821
You found it
in his desk the next day.

939
01:18:51,391 --> 01:18:52,759
I don't understand.

940
01:18:54,227 --> 01:18:56,429
You were just testing me,
weren't you?

941
01:18:58,765 --> 01:19:01,635
Trying to see
how my head worked...

942
01:19:01,768 --> 01:19:04,105
if I was really as smart
as everyone said.

943
01:19:05,405 --> 01:19:07,540
Why would I care
to do that?

944
01:19:11,745 --> 01:19:13,847
Gracie was kidnapped
a week later.

945
01:19:19,954 --> 01:19:21,788
What are you asking me?

946
01:19:27,460 --> 01:19:29,030
Are you the bad guy?

947
01:19:33,767 --> 01:19:36,103
I'm an educator, Abe.

948
01:19:37,604 --> 01:19:38,772
I hope you understand

949
01:19:38,906 --> 01:19:40,774
how even
the most outlandish claim

950
01:19:40,908 --> 01:19:42,709
could tarnish my career...

951
01:19:44,210 --> 01:19:46,680
stir doubts
about my character.

952
01:19:48,682 --> 01:19:51,651
I found the picture you stole
from Patrick's locker.

953
01:19:56,690 --> 01:19:59,225
You thought
it was Caroline, didn't you?

954
01:20:01,128 --> 01:20:02,696
In the tiger mask.

955
01:20:08,635 --> 01:20:09,769
It wasn't?

956
01:20:14,841 --> 01:20:16,043
Are you sure?

957
01:20:17,945 --> 01:20:20,081
I know about
the paper flowers.

958
01:20:25,685 --> 01:20:27,387
You killed her boyfriend.

959
01:20:28,688 --> 01:20:30,925
You wanted someone innocent,

960
01:20:31,058 --> 01:20:33,426
untouched, just like Gracie.

961
01:20:33,560 --> 01:20:36,030
You thought
he'd ruined her for you.

962
01:20:41,301 --> 01:20:43,070
Gracie wasn't innocent.

963
01:20:46,907 --> 01:20:52,113
She used to stop by my office
just to show me her outfits.

964
01:20:54,081 --> 01:20:55,582
She was 14.

965
01:20:57,118 --> 01:20:59,486
Of all people...

966
01:20:59,619 --> 01:21:02,589
you should appreciate
the relativity of age.

967
01:21:04,758 --> 01:21:09,096
That girl got
what she always wanted.

968
01:21:11,397 --> 01:21:14,434
She would have loved
to see this place.

969
01:21:14,567 --> 01:21:17,938
Her face
on every telephone pole.

970
01:21:18,072 --> 01:21:22,542
People marching through
the marshes, arm in arm.

971
01:21:22,675 --> 01:21:25,311
For a month, the whole country
knew her name.

972
01:21:26,613 --> 01:21:28,715
I should have seen it.

973
01:21:28,848 --> 01:21:30,316
I could have saved her.

974
01:21:31,785 --> 01:21:33,419
You were just a kid.

975
01:21:35,022 --> 01:21:37,224
No one expected you
to find her.

976
01:21:39,392 --> 01:21:40,660
She did.

977
01:21:42,595 --> 01:21:46,066
Abe,
I watched you grow up

978
01:21:46,200 --> 01:21:47,935
with the weight
of the entire town

979
01:21:48,068 --> 01:21:49,469
on your conscience.

980
01:21:50,971 --> 01:21:54,175
I always felt
a little sorry for you.

981
01:21:56,743 --> 01:21:58,611
No child
could survive that.

982
01:22:01,282 --> 01:22:02,950
What happened to her?

983
01:22:06,686 --> 01:22:08,354
She didn't last long.

984
01:22:10,024 --> 01:22:12,026
Her spirit went soft...

985
01:22:14,128 --> 01:22:16,030
after I gave
our daughter away.

986
01:22:19,432 --> 01:22:20,633
What?

987
01:22:23,770 --> 01:22:25,605
Everyone knows me here.

988
01:22:27,308 --> 01:22:30,610
I can't have a newborn
suddenly appear out of nowhere.

989
01:22:32,345 --> 01:22:35,282
It wasn't easy,
leaving Caroline on the steps

990
01:22:35,415 --> 01:22:38,118
for those decrepit
church mice.

991
01:22:38,252 --> 01:22:40,988
But I knew they wouldn't ask
any questions.

992
01:22:42,488 --> 01:22:46,559
My only consolation was
watching her mature

993
01:22:46,693 --> 01:22:49,362
with such grace
and sensibility.

994
01:22:51,664 --> 01:22:54,034
I took something beautiful...

995
01:22:55,401 --> 01:22:57,171
but I gave something back.

996
01:22:59,306 --> 01:23:00,707
Something better.

997
01:23:03,344 --> 01:23:05,346
Balance was restored.

998
01:23:27,867 --> 01:23:31,105
I was relieved when I first
heard they were dating.

999
01:23:32,705 --> 01:23:34,774
He seemed sort of...

1000
01:23:34,909 --> 01:23:36,944
sexless and irrelevant.

1001
01:23:41,748 --> 01:23:43,549
Congratulations, Abe.

1002
01:23:44,817 --> 01:23:47,087
You've solved
your first murder.

1003
01:23:49,924 --> 01:23:51,258
What now?

1004
01:24:08,309 --> 01:24:09,910
I'm not afraid of you.

1005
01:24:14,982 --> 01:24:16,417
Nobody is.

1006
01:24:20,220 --> 01:24:23,290
There's a reason
I always obliged you, Abe.

1007
01:24:25,792 --> 01:24:29,997
We both know how it feels
when nobody takes you seriously.

1008
01:24:33,934 --> 01:24:37,503
Now they'll know
what we were capable of.

1009
01:28:00,641 --> 01:28:02,376
Abe?

1010
01:28:04,877 --> 01:28:06,712
I found her.

1011
01:28:06,846 --> 01:28:10,250
What are you talking about?
My cat is a boy.

1012
01:28:10,384 --> 01:28:11,652
I found her.

1013
01:28:14,221 --> 01:28:15,222
What?

1014
01:28:16,456 --> 01:28:18,158
She's too scared
to talk to me.

1015
01:28:23,897 --> 01:28:25,566
When I was 32,
I solved the case

1016
01:28:25,698 --> 01:28:27,668
of the Willowbrook kidnapper.

1017
01:28:29,036 --> 01:28:30,604
It was Ellis Erwin...

1018
01:28:32,339 --> 01:28:34,041
the evil principal.

1019
01:29:03,136 --> 01:29:04,438
Gracie's discovery remained

1020
01:29:04,571 --> 01:29:06,707
a national news story
for weeks.

1021
01:29:09,710 --> 01:29:13,146
I was the kid detective
who never gave up.

1022
01:29:14,847 --> 01:29:17,317
The governor presented me
with a medal.

1023
01:29:18,851 --> 01:29:20,786
Rory Beans accepted
a handshake.

1024
01:29:24,057 --> 01:29:26,727
The widow Gulliver called me
a hero.

1025
01:29:29,463 --> 01:29:31,632
I think her cat is
probably dead though.

1026
01:29:41,008 --> 01:29:44,311
It was like the whole town
returned to color overnight.

1027
01:29:47,247 --> 01:29:49,782
People came out
for the potato festival

1028
01:29:49,916 --> 01:29:52,753
for the first time
in 18 years.

1029
01:29:52,886 --> 01:29:53,920
Morning, Abe.

1030
01:30:06,633 --> 01:30:09,503
Even Lucy started
looking at me differently.

1031
01:30:13,273 --> 01:30:14,274
Wait.

1032
01:30:16,610 --> 01:30:18,211
She's in there.

1033
01:30:36,263 --> 01:30:37,664
Caroline.

1034
01:30:41,902 --> 01:30:42,803
How are you?

1035
01:30:44,771 --> 01:30:46,139
I'm okay.

1036
01:30:58,018 --> 01:30:59,986
What happened to your office?

1037
01:31:02,089 --> 01:31:04,157
I had to take
the old headlines down.

1038
01:31:05,459 --> 01:31:06,493
Looked too stupid.

1039
01:31:08,161 --> 01:31:09,663
Feels pretty empty.

1040
01:31:12,666 --> 01:31:14,768
Are you back at school?

1041
01:31:14,901 --> 01:31:16,169
Not yet.

1042
01:31:17,371 --> 01:31:18,538
That's good.

1043
01:31:18,672 --> 01:31:20,273
You should take your time.

1044
01:31:22,042 --> 01:31:24,244
No one really knows
what to say to me.

1045
01:31:28,148 --> 01:31:29,216
And your grandparents?

1046
01:31:31,852 --> 01:31:34,755
They're still
pretty confused.

1047
01:31:34,888 --> 01:31:36,590
They thought
I was a gift from Jesus,

1048
01:31:36,723 --> 01:31:39,426
not some pedophile rapist.

1049
01:31:42,963 --> 01:31:44,431
I'm sorry.

1050
01:31:46,867 --> 01:31:48,502
It's not like
you didn't warn me.

1051
01:31:50,303 --> 01:31:53,240
No matter how simple
a case may seem,

1052
01:31:53,373 --> 01:31:55,942
it's always shocking
what you find.

1053
01:31:56,076 --> 01:31:58,678
I was just being pretentious.

1054
01:31:58,812 --> 01:32:00,046
Still...

1055
01:32:01,648 --> 01:32:03,850
isn't it better
to know the truth?

1056
01:32:12,192 --> 01:32:14,060
Well, at least
you saved Gracie.

1057
01:32:15,362 --> 01:32:16,963
Yeah, sort of.

1058
01:32:18,698 --> 01:32:20,667
Has she reached out
to you yet?

1059
01:32:22,369 --> 01:32:23,970
She's just a kid.

1060
01:32:41,588 --> 01:32:42,656
Hi.

1061
01:32:46,193 --> 01:32:47,727
Can I get you
a tea or something?

1062
01:32:47,861 --> 01:32:50,163
Oh, no, thank you.
We're okay.

1063
01:32:56,570 --> 01:32:59,673
How are you enjoying
the extra space?

1064
01:32:59,806 --> 01:33:01,107
It's great.

1065
01:33:02,442 --> 01:33:04,845
Not a little lonely
without Corey?

1066
01:33:06,379 --> 01:33:08,482
- He was kind of a deadbeat.
- Oh.

1067
01:33:10,383 --> 01:33:12,085
It's so tidy.

1068
01:33:13,487 --> 01:33:15,522
- Yeah, I hired a cleaning lady.
- Oh.

1069
01:33:18,625 --> 01:33:21,161
Oh, did you see
you were in another magazine?

1070
01:33:23,096 --> 01:33:25,232
It's a story
that touches people.

1071
01:33:25,365 --> 01:33:26,800
Getting any money
out of that?

1072
01:33:28,835 --> 01:33:31,171
It's good for business.

1073
01:33:31,304 --> 01:33:32,639
You, um...

1074
01:33:32,772 --> 01:33:34,207
You seem tired.

1075
01:33:35,876 --> 01:33:38,745
Yeah, I've been having
a little trouble sleeping.

1076
01:33:38,879 --> 01:33:40,915
Why? What's wrong?

1077
01:33:41,047 --> 01:33:42,917
It's nothing.

1078
01:33:43,049 --> 01:33:44,551
The floor creaks at night.

1079
01:33:49,356 --> 01:33:52,626
You know, they, um...
They called us for a quote.

1080
01:33:52,759 --> 01:33:53,860
I hope you don't mind.

1081
01:34:06,473 --> 01:34:07,874
Are you all right?

1082
01:34:16,216 --> 01:34:17,350
Abe.

1083
01:34:18,685 --> 01:34:20,687
What's the matter?

1084
01:34:54,102 --> 01:34:59,102
