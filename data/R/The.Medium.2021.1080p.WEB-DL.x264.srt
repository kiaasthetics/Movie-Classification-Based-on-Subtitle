2
00:00:55,584 --> 00:00:58,211
People here have believed in god since ancient times.

3
00:00:59,171 --> 00:01:02,256
Maybe even before the existence of religion.

4
00:01:08,806 --> 00:01:11,140
But for people of the Northeast

5
00:01:11,141 --> 00:01:12,809
The definition of God,

6
00:01:12,810 --> 00:01:16,187
May be different from others.

7
00:01:31,829 --> 00:01:36,207
Every supernatural occurrence,

8
00:01:37,167 --> 00:01:39,502
We call God.

9
00:01:40,129 --> 00:01:43,673
Not just the spirits of the dead.

10
00:01:52,141 --> 00:01:56,019
We believe that everything in
this world has a spirit.

11
00:02:00,816 --> 00:02:02,066
Home

12
00:02:03,235 --> 00:02:05,028
Forest, mountain

13
00:02:09,575 --> 00:02:10,783
Tree

14
00:02:12,619 --> 00:02:13,870
Field

15
00:02:15,164 --> 00:02:18,916
Everything has a spirit.

16
00:02:21,075 --> 00:02:29,802
In 2018, a documentary team traveled to Thailand to cover the lives of shamans.

17
00:02:30,250 --> 00:02:38,650
After interviewing several shamans, the team decided to follow Nimâ€™s daily life.

18
00:02:39,350 --> 00:02:43,007
Bayan Spirit Medium

19
00:02:46,987 --> 00:02:50,866
There are different types of "gods"
in the Northeast.

20
00:02:50,866 --> 00:02:54,911
For example, god of healing, god of wealth,
god of ancestors, god of family.

21
00:02:54,912 --> 00:02:58,039
Butterfly god, city god, god who eats offerings etc.

22
00:02:58,165 --> 00:02:59,665
There are various types of gods.

23
00:03:00,167 --> 00:03:02,335
Good spirits

24
00:03:02,336 --> 00:03:04,212
will protect us,

25
00:03:04,630 --> 00:03:11,427
bad spirits will bring pain and calamity.

26
00:03:11,553 --> 00:03:13,930
Who is the spirit in your body?

27
00:03:14,932 --> 00:03:17,266
I'll try to explain.

28
00:03:17,559 --> 00:03:20,019
People call him "Martian"

29
00:03:20,687 --> 00:03:22,772
At least people in the northeast call him that.

30
00:03:23,607 --> 00:03:27,026
I am the shaman possessed by the spirit of Bayan.

31
00:04:09,528 --> 00:04:12,405
Bayan is an ancestral god.

32
00:04:12,489 --> 00:04:18,077
He is a good spirit who hass
blessed the people here.

33
00:04:20,539 --> 00:04:24,250
Actually no one knows who he is
and where he came from.

34
00:04:24,334 --> 00:04:27,420
But everyone believes in him
since ancient times.

35
00:04:35,125 --> 00:04:43,300
"The Descendants of the Shamans" is a documentary.

36
00:04:43,604 --> 00:04:44,600
My family,

37
00:04:44,938 --> 00:04:48,816
for generations, they have been a medium for
the spirit of Bayan.

38
00:04:49,484 --> 00:04:53,154
Since birth, my grandmother has been
possessed by the spirit of bayan.

39
00:04:53,238 --> 00:04:57,742
Bayan only possesses women as a medium.

40
00:04:57,826 --> 00:05:00,703
Many people came to my grandmother.

41
00:05:01,330 --> 00:05:05,291
And every year there is a great ceremony.

42
00:05:06,001 --> 00:05:11,214
In the past people will ask for fortune telling.

43
00:05:11,548 --> 00:05:13,841
When grandmother died,

44
00:05:14,843 --> 00:05:18,012
Her spirit was passed on to my aunt.

45
00:05:20,057 --> 00:05:20,973
After my aunt,

46
00:05:21,433 --> 00:05:26,020
It seemed to be attracted to my sister Noy,

47
00:05:27,689 --> 00:05:29,523
But Noy refused the spirit.

48
00:05:30,484 --> 00:05:35,529
Therefore, Bayan chose my body.

49
00:05:39,868 --> 00:05:44,288
When a shaman is in trance, will the whole
body tremble and the voice will change?

50
00:05:44,373 --> 00:05:48,501
You watch too much TV,
it's not really like this.

51
00:05:49,002 --> 00:05:53,589
People come to me every day.

52
00:05:53,674 --> 00:05:56,217
They come for treatment.

53
00:05:56,218 --> 00:05:59,512
Some may even ask for a blessing.

54
00:06:00,305 --> 00:06:04,350
Some also make offerings such
as alcohol and chicken.

55
00:06:05,394 --> 00:06:06,769
Why did you come here?

56
00:06:06,853 --> 00:06:09,730
He caught a snake and
soaked it in alcohol to drink.

57
00:06:09,856 --> 00:06:14,110
-I told him not to drink it.
-After drinking his hands and feet got numb.

58
00:06:14,736 --> 00:06:16,487
Where did you catch the snake?

59
00:06:17,114 --> 00:06:18,406
In the cemetery.

60
00:06:18,907 --> 00:06:22,201
I guess that's the reason why you're sick.

61
00:06:22,619 --> 00:06:25,788
Because you ate the spirit of a beast.

62
00:06:35,590 --> 00:06:37,633
Can you cure any disease?

63
00:06:37,634 --> 00:06:39,677
If you have cancer,
come to me

64
00:06:41,013 --> 00:06:42,096
Then you will die.

65
00:06:45,434 --> 00:06:49,520
I can only cure disease
caused by the supernatural.

66
00:06:49,938 --> 00:06:55,067
If you're possessed by an evil spirit or a
spirit from another realm, I can heal it.

67
00:06:55,152 --> 00:06:59,155
But if it's a common disease,
go to a doctor.

68
00:08:01,635 --> 00:08:05,888
I never wanted to be a shaman.

69
00:08:06,139 --> 00:08:09,100
At the time, what did you do?

70
00:08:09,101 --> 00:08:13,729
I'm very sick and can't be cured.

71
00:08:14,147 --> 00:08:18,109
I was so desperate, I wanted to kill myself.

72
00:08:18,110 --> 00:08:21,987
Because I was chosen, I ran away.
Although, in the end I accepted it.

73
00:08:21,988 --> 00:08:24,240
And that's amazing.

74
00:08:24,241 --> 00:08:28,702
My daily life is just praying
and doing rituals.

75
00:08:28,787 --> 00:08:34,583
People come to me, to ask for help.
Some of them are in terrible condition.

76
00:08:35,627 --> 00:08:38,546
Anyway, I'm happy now.

77
00:08:39,089 --> 00:08:42,716
In fact, I can't remember why I use to refuse,

78
00:08:43,009 --> 00:08:45,010
And why I was angry with him.

79
00:09:13,725 --> 00:09:21,438
THE MEDIUM (RANG ZONG)

80
00:09:25,343 --> 00:09:29,138
We're going to Willow's funeral,
can you tell me who he was?

81
00:09:29,139 --> 00:09:36,061
Willow is the husband of my sister Noy.

82
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:39,190
Last year he found out that he had cancer.

83
00:09:39,608 --> 00:09:40,858
Condolences.

84
00:09:41,651 --> 00:09:48,324
I don't know why members of the Asatia family,
die tragically.

85
00:09:48,366 --> 00:09:52,786
His grandfather was killed by his men.

86
00:09:53,899 --> 00:09:59,613
When his father's factory went bankrupt,
his father burned it down, in order to receive
insurance compensation.

87
00:10:00,170 --> 00:10:03,380
After being caught,
he committed suicide by drinking poison.

88
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:06,008
As for his eldest son Mike.

89
00:10:07,511 --> 00:10:09,845
He died in a motorcycle accident
last year.

90
00:10:11,389 --> 00:10:12,139
Hmm...

91
00:10:33,286 --> 00:10:34,370
Are you alright?

92
00:10:34,871 --> 00:10:38,666
I almost forgot how you look.

93
00:10:38,750 --> 00:10:41,085
Does someone have to die,
so we can meet?

94
00:10:41,378 --> 00:10:44,046
-Do you want me to bring this to them?
-Yes, please bring it.

95
00:10:45,423 --> 00:10:49,385
-I forgot all the faces of my family.
-Alright, I'll take it.

96
00:10:54,683 --> 00:10:56,767
He's the priest of the church,
Noy frequents.

97
00:10:57,644 --> 00:10:58,978
Thank you for coming.

98
00:11:00,855 --> 00:11:03,899
Min, find a chair for the priest.

99
00:11:12,867 --> 00:11:14,910
Min, are you okay?

100
00:11:15,287 --> 00:11:18,872
I heard you were the first,
to see your father's body.

101
00:11:18,873 --> 00:11:20,624
I'm fine.

102
00:11:24,754 --> 00:11:28,549
There are three of us in my family.

103
00:11:28,550 --> 00:11:30,009
Manit is the eldest brother.

104
00:11:30,635 --> 00:11:33,345
Stop smoking, it'll get you killed.

105
00:11:33,430 --> 00:11:36,140
Would you like a glass of water?

106
00:11:36,558 --> 00:11:39,268
Noy is the second sister and then there's me.

107
00:11:39,269 --> 00:11:40,519
And also,

108
00:11:40,604 --> 00:11:43,689
Noy's husband, Willow, who just passed away.

109
00:11:44,065 --> 00:11:49,194
Not long ago, Noy's son Mike also died.

110
00:11:49,362 --> 00:11:50,195
Now...

111
00:11:50,196 --> 00:11:54,366
Noy lives with
her only child, Min.

112
00:11:55,201 --> 00:12:00,581
Actually Noy and Willow got married late.

113
00:12:00,665 --> 00:12:02,249
After they got married,

114
00:12:03,043 --> 00:12:07,087
Noy inherited her mother-in-law's
dog meat shop.

115
00:12:07,339 --> 00:12:09,590
Previously, it was her mother-in-law
who ran it.

116
00:12:10,550 --> 00:12:12,009
I don't know why she took it.

117
00:12:12,302 --> 00:12:14,511
The government prohibits selling dog meat,
but they still sell it secretly.

118
00:12:14,554 --> 00:12:17,222
These two don't get along,

119
00:12:17,349 --> 00:12:22,770
I didn't know what the problem is,
but it's been going on for a long time.

120
00:12:22,854 --> 00:12:29,026
I also tried to mend their relationship.

121
00:12:29,736 --> 00:12:35,032
-Put on your own shoes.
-Don't wear other people's shoes.

122
00:12:36,284 --> 00:12:37,826
Thank you.

123
00:12:40,205 --> 00:12:40,996
Aunt.

124
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:45,501
Mom asked you to go home
to get something for me.

125
00:12:45,919 --> 00:12:48,796
I've written everything down here.

126
00:13:09,567 --> 00:13:10,401
Aunt Nimes.

127
00:13:20,995 --> 00:13:23,100
-There you are.
-Is the door closed?
-Yes

128
00:13:23,164 --> 00:13:25,582
-Lucky can't leave the house.
-Stop it.

129
00:13:27,168 --> 00:13:31,171
You brought the wrong clothes,
it should be the thicker one.

130
00:13:31,256 --> 00:13:33,715
Then you go and
get it yourself.

131
00:13:39,848 --> 00:13:41,432
Uncle, what did you say earlier?

132
00:13:42,892 --> 00:13:44,601
Did I say something?

133
00:13:44,686 --> 00:13:48,230
-Damn it, say it one more time.
-What did I say?

134
00:13:48,314 --> 00:13:51,859
Just because of the card, why are you cursing me?

135
00:13:52,068 --> 00:13:54,111
I didn't say anything.

136
00:13:54,195 --> 00:13:55,988
What are you doing?

137
00:13:56,072 --> 00:13:57,072
What did i do?

138
00:13:57,198 --> 00:13:58,699
What? You said I look like a prostitute.

139
00:13:58,783 --> 00:13:59,908
Min, stop!

140
00:14:00,493 --> 00:14:02,411
I didn't say that.

141
00:14:04,622 --> 00:14:06,123
Mom, do something.

142
00:14:06,207 --> 00:14:07,166
Min, stop it!

143
00:14:07,250 --> 00:14:10,836
-Come out first.
-No, he did say it.

144
00:14:11,337 --> 00:14:13,839
-Who said something?
-You bastard.

145
00:14:13,923 --> 00:14:17,593
-You bastard.
-Calm down.

146
00:14:17,677 --> 00:14:20,637
-Let go of me, mom.
-Min, calm down.

147
00:14:22,056 --> 00:14:24,308
He did say it earlier.

148
00:14:24,851 --> 00:14:26,310
I didn't say anything.

149
00:14:26,394 --> 00:14:30,397
Does Min usually drink this much?

150
00:14:31,691 --> 00:14:34,359
She did drink but I didn't know,
she drank that much.

151
00:14:34,778 --> 00:14:37,279
It's the first time,
I've seen her like that.

152
00:14:38,239 --> 00:14:40,824
-Fine, go.
-I'll go first.

153
00:14:43,411 --> 00:14:44,495
Drive carefully.

154
00:15:10,897 --> 00:15:12,147
Min?

155
00:15:15,151 --> 00:15:16,151
Min?

156
00:16:16,004 --> 00:16:17,129
Who died?

157
00:16:17,755 --> 00:16:20,090
The blind grandma who lives back there.

158
00:16:21,593 --> 00:16:23,302
How did she die?

159
00:16:24,262 --> 00:16:25,304
I don't know.

160
00:16:49,329 --> 00:16:50,454
Min.

161
00:18:09,867 --> 00:18:11,535
Nim, what's wrong?

162
00:18:16,249 --> 00:18:17,916
Why did you go into Min's room?

163
00:18:18,918 --> 00:18:20,502
What are you looking for?

164
00:18:20,503 --> 00:18:24,381
I'm asking you, why won't you answer?

165
00:18:24,841 --> 00:18:26,383
Why are you suddenly like this.

166
00:18:26,384 --> 00:18:28,593
I'll help you find it, but you need to
tell me what's going on...

167
00:18:34,559 --> 00:18:37,185
Look, you see this?

168
00:18:40,022 --> 00:18:41,732
You know what this is?

169
00:18:41,858 --> 00:18:42,691
What...

170
00:18:44,152 --> 00:18:46,069
What are you doing in my room,
everyone out!

171
00:18:46,154 --> 00:18:47,904
-Min, wait a minute.
-Mom, you too.

172
00:18:48,781 --> 00:18:51,658
Min, did you have a bad dream
or hear a strange sound?

173
00:18:51,743 --> 00:18:54,161
-Nothing, I said nothing.
-Min.

174
00:18:54,245 --> 00:18:56,288
I told you to get out!

175
00:18:57,206 --> 00:18:58,749
What are you recording?

176
00:19:06,132 --> 00:19:08,717
Do you know what this is made of?

177
00:19:13,056 --> 00:19:16,016
Tell me, does Min show any strange behaviour?

178
00:19:20,229 --> 00:19:20,979
Noy.

179
00:19:21,856 --> 00:19:25,358
I can take care of my child, leave.

180
00:19:27,695 --> 00:19:30,989
What's that thing in Min's closet?

181
00:19:31,074 --> 00:19:32,741
It's called "Wampa Taba".

182
00:19:32,742 --> 00:19:38,288
It's believed to ward off evil spirits.

183
00:19:40,333 --> 00:19:45,378
Entering people's room and rummage
through things without permission.

184
00:19:45,671 --> 00:19:47,005
So annyoing,

185
00:19:47,799 --> 00:19:49,216
right?

186
00:19:51,677 --> 00:19:53,845
Why did you put "Wampa Taba" in you room?

187
00:19:57,600 --> 00:20:00,852
I'm not a child, I'm an adult.

188
00:20:03,898 --> 00:20:08,193
Why did you stare at the blind grandma,
at the funeral yesterday?

189
00:20:08,736 --> 00:20:10,487
What blind grandma?

190
00:20:19,372 --> 00:20:20,997
Do you see anyone there?

191
00:20:33,094 --> 00:20:35,512
Yes, I can see them.

192
00:20:36,556 --> 00:20:37,639
What's the matter?

193
00:20:44,588 --> 00:20:48,518
When the Documentary Team reviewed
the video footage,

194
00:20:48,542 --> 00:20:52,382
Min's strange behavior
was caught on camera.

195
00:21:01,247 --> 00:21:03,707
Is there any explanation for
Min's strange behaviour?

196
00:21:06,419 --> 00:21:10,005
From what I've seen so far,
there are several reasons why.

197
00:21:10,006 --> 00:21:13,550
Is it a sign that the spirit of Bayan
is going to possess her?

198
00:21:19,640 --> 00:21:21,349
I don't know.

199
00:21:22,703 --> 00:21:28,579
If it's true that the spirit of Bayan is passed down from
generation to generation, this is an opportunity.

200
00:21:28,603 --> 00:21:33,983
It is rare for a documentary team to record the
occurrence of a Bayan's medium transfer.

201
00:21:34,084 --> 00:21:39,507
Finally the Documentary Team decided
to cover Min and her family.

202
00:21:48,169 --> 00:21:51,046
Sir, do you want to keep recording all day?

203
00:21:51,547 --> 00:21:54,925
It's okay. Just take it easy.

204
00:21:57,720 --> 00:22:00,013
Can you talk about your work?

205
00:22:00,681 --> 00:22:03,516
Sure.

206
00:22:03,913 --> 00:22:04,852
Human Resources Office

207
00:22:04,852 --> 00:22:06,228
I work in human resources.

208
00:22:06,270 --> 00:22:09,314
I'm responsible to help
people find work.

209
00:22:14,695 --> 00:22:15,278
Number Six.

210
00:22:19,533 --> 00:22:20,367
Hello.

211
00:22:23,579 --> 00:22:25,997
I woke up at 5am.

212
00:22:26,123 --> 00:22:29,000
After waking up, I have breakfast and
arrive at the office around 7-8am.

213
00:22:31,587 --> 00:22:34,339
There aren't many visitors in the afternoon,
so I can rest for a while.

214
00:22:34,423 --> 00:22:36,591
Actually, this job

215
00:22:36,634 --> 00:22:37,008
it's not too difficult.

216
00:22:39,679 --> 00:22:41,012
Do you like your job?

217
00:22:41,389 --> 00:22:45,183
Yes, I like it. I love being able
to help others find a job.

218
00:22:46,519 --> 00:22:47,435
Really?

219
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:49,646
Of course, is this an interview
for Miss Thailand?

220
00:22:50,940 --> 00:22:53,900
What do you think of your aunt being a shaman?

221
00:22:54,527 --> 00:22:56,111
Witch doctor?

222
00:22:56,737 --> 00:22:57,737
To be honest,

223
00:22:58,114 --> 00:23:00,031
I think it's all fake.

224
00:23:00,408 --> 00:23:03,326
Suddenly dancing like a monkey
and calling for god...

225
00:23:03,327 --> 00:23:04,828
What exactly are you doing.

226
00:23:04,912 --> 00:23:08,790
I've also met someone who said
she was a Doraemon shaman.

227
00:23:10,751 --> 00:23:11,501
Very funny.

228
00:23:13,796 --> 00:23:15,088
What is a Doraemon shaman like?

229
00:23:15,506 --> 00:23:18,008
Maybe when in trance, you will make sounds like
"Ang Ang Ang"

230
00:23:18,384 --> 00:23:20,927
You want me to cast a shaman spell?

231
00:23:25,683 --> 00:23:26,391
See?

232
00:23:26,726 --> 00:23:30,061
Anyone can do it, you can just learn it
from watching a video.

233
00:23:39,196 --> 00:23:41,656
-How much is it?
-100 baht.

234
00:23:41,699 --> 00:23:42,532
Thank you.

235
00:23:42,616 --> 00:23:44,993
I don't know why it's banned.

236
00:23:45,578 --> 00:23:47,662
People here, have been eating dog meat
for a long time.

237
00:23:47,747 --> 00:23:51,249
Still, you're selling dog meat and
keep a dog at home.

238
00:23:51,250 --> 00:23:52,584
Don't you think it's weird?

239
00:23:52,668 --> 00:23:54,502
Not at all.

240
00:23:54,837 --> 00:23:59,174
Don't people who raise goldfish or koi,
also eat fish?

241
00:24:00,009 --> 00:24:02,093
May I ask you about the Bayan spirit?

242
00:24:02,136 --> 00:24:07,015
Can you remember what it feelt like,
when Bayan was about to possess you?

243
00:24:08,017 --> 00:24:11,019
I was probably 20 years
old at the time.

244
00:24:11,562 --> 00:24:17,108
My body feels weird, people say it's a divine disease.
And my head hurts a lot too.

245
00:24:20,738 --> 00:24:24,366
Every day I have my menstrual period
and it lasts for 5 months.

246
00:24:24,492 --> 00:24:29,788
Since my aunt is also a shaman,
she said I should inherit it.

247
00:24:30,331 --> 00:24:32,832
But I don't want to be a shaman.

248
00:24:33,709 --> 00:24:36,711
So I embraced christianity.

249
00:24:37,505 --> 00:24:40,840
I pray to God not to become a shaman.

250
00:24:40,925 --> 00:24:46,930
Forgive, as you will be forgiven.
To those who have trespassed against us.

251
00:24:47,014 --> 00:24:53,019
If the trespass is unforgivable, so be it.

252
00:24:53,062 --> 00:24:56,731
Then something strange happened
to my sister Nim.

253
00:24:56,732 --> 00:24:59,734
At that time she learned how to sew in the city.

254
00:25:00,403 --> 00:25:03,780
She suddenly fainted and lost consciousness.

255
00:25:04,198 --> 00:25:06,116
No specific cause.

256
00:25:06,492 --> 00:25:08,785
We were terrified at the time
and took Nimes home.

257
00:25:09,537 --> 00:25:11,996
Not long after, the spirit of
Bayan possessed Nim.

258
00:25:13,707 --> 00:25:16,167
No one knows why.

259
00:25:17,086 --> 00:25:19,754
I feel guilty when I think about it.

260
00:25:20,589 --> 00:25:23,508
Nim became a shaman instead of me.

261
00:25:25,928 --> 00:25:28,638
What should you do if Bayan possessed you?

262
00:25:28,722 --> 00:25:31,099
If you ask stupid things like this
in an interview.

263
00:25:31,183 --> 00:25:33,518
It's best not to have the interview
and record it.

264
00:26:01,297 --> 00:26:04,340
Wow, you look beautiful Min.

265
00:26:04,508 --> 00:26:06,926
But, why are you wearing other people's shoes?

266
00:26:08,929 --> 00:26:11,139
I must look beautiful on the day of celebration.

267
00:26:11,432 --> 00:26:12,515
Does it feel comfortable to wear?

268
00:26:12,892 --> 00:26:16,686
Not bad but it feels a bit big.

269
00:26:27,072 --> 00:26:30,992
Has Min's behaviour been
different lately?

270
00:26:30,993 --> 00:26:33,203
What's different is not only her behaviour.

271
00:26:33,287 --> 00:26:35,288
I don't know what's wrong with her.

272
00:26:35,372 --> 00:26:36,831
But she looks like a
different person.

273
00:26:37,249 --> 00:26:39,000
Wait a moment...

274
00:26:39,877 --> 00:26:41,336
Hey! Min, where are you going?

275
00:26:43,214 --> 00:26:44,130
Stop! That's a kids game.

276
00:26:44,131 --> 00:26:45,298
I'll get in trouble.

277
00:26:46,217 --> 00:26:47,634
But, I want to play.

278
00:26:48,177 --> 00:26:49,594
Are you crazy, hurry up and
get out.

279
00:26:53,098 --> 00:26:55,350
Min, you idiot!

280
00:27:02,858 --> 00:27:03,650
What are you doing Min?

281
00:27:03,984 --> 00:27:05,568
Idiot.

282
00:27:25,506 --> 00:27:27,006
What are you doing?

283
00:27:39,979 --> 00:27:41,896
Lisa!

284
00:27:54,910 --> 00:27:57,328
Stop recording.

285
00:27:57,997 --> 00:27:59,497
I'm not feeling right now.

286
00:28:01,250 --> 00:28:23,296
I said stop recording.

287
00:28:23,296 --> 00:28:25,023
Human Resources Office
I said stop recording.

288
00:28:25,023 --> 00:28:26,209
Human Resources Office

289
00:28:39,663 --> 00:28:43,541
Min, why did you leave me with this idiot.

290
00:28:43,542 --> 00:28:45,835
Don't ask for my help again, bitch.

291
00:28:58,724 --> 00:28:59,515
You hear? Min!

292
00:28:59,516 --> 00:29:00,099
Wait a minute, I'm coming.

293
00:29:11,612 --> 00:29:14,739
Hey Min, why are you sleeping here?

294
00:29:15,991 --> 00:29:18,660
Get up. Take a shower
and get ready for work.

295
00:30:39,700 --> 00:30:41,409
Min. Min.

296
00:30:41,827 --> 00:30:44,537
What's wrong, Min?

297
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:51,085
Where did you sleep last night?
Why didn't you pick up your phone?

298
00:30:51,086 --> 00:30:52,837
Stop going to nightclubs.

299
00:30:57,801 --> 00:30:58,843
Min, what is wrong?

300
00:31:00,304 --> 00:31:02,472
Nothing, just my regular period.

301
00:31:02,556 --> 00:31:04,557
Since when? Talk to me for a minute.

302
00:31:07,227 --> 00:31:10,354
Min, talk to me. How long have you had your period?

303
00:31:12,024 --> 00:31:15,401
-Pang, have you seen Manit?
-He went to meet his friend.

304
00:31:15,486 --> 00:31:17,653
-Who?
-I don't know either.

305
00:31:31,210 --> 00:31:33,795
Manit, what are you doing here?

306
00:31:34,087 --> 00:31:36,255
What will you say to your wife and kid?

307
00:31:36,507 --> 00:31:39,133
Come with me, I have something to tell you.

308
00:31:39,593 --> 00:31:40,259
Hurry up!

309
00:31:43,555 --> 00:31:48,059
Don't you think Min's condition,
is similar to Nim's back then?

310
00:31:48,936 --> 00:31:49,393
Right.

311
00:31:50,103 --> 00:31:54,690
-Leave it to Nim, she'll help her.
-I don't want my daughter to be a shaman.

312
00:31:55,734 --> 00:31:59,987
What if Bayan will still possess Min?
What would you do?

313
00:32:03,116 --> 00:32:07,745
-I really don't know.
-Think carefully.

314
00:32:45,993 --> 00:32:47,660
What are you looking at?

315
00:32:48,620 --> 00:32:50,997
Honey, calm down.

316
00:32:52,124 --> 00:32:54,542
-Don't meddle in my business!
-Hey, what are you doing?

317
00:32:54,626 --> 00:32:56,627
-What are you doing?
-Drive the bus.

318
00:32:57,588 --> 00:32:59,422
-Get off, get out of the bus.
-No.

319
00:32:59,756 --> 00:33:04,343
-Sir, stop the bus.
-Why do I have to get out?

320
00:33:04,428 --> 00:33:07,013
-Are you crazy?
-You're crazy! Bitch.

321
00:33:09,308 --> 00:33:10,266
Bastard!

322
00:33:10,893 --> 00:33:12,768
-Go to hell.
-You bastards!

323
00:33:16,315 --> 00:33:18,024
Curse you!

324
00:33:24,698 --> 00:33:25,740
Damn it.

325
00:33:26,325 --> 00:33:29,785
What's wrong with me, you idiot.

326
00:33:36,919 --> 00:33:38,169
What are you saying?

327
00:33:41,924 --> 00:33:44,383
Leave, all of you!

328
00:33:56,521 --> 00:33:59,899
Fuck all of you!

329
00:34:08,992 --> 00:34:11,535
-Are these all the recordings?
-Yes.

330
00:34:12,996 --> 00:34:16,582
Is Min acting weird
and look like somebody else?

331
00:34:17,626 --> 00:34:21,587
She use to act like a child.

332
00:34:22,923 --> 00:34:26,384
Is there any other behavior besides that?

333
00:34:26,843 --> 00:34:30,054
Just that, nothing else.

334
00:34:37,938 --> 00:34:42,441
-Did you see my bracelet?
-What?

335
00:34:42,526 --> 00:34:46,153
I think I lost it while picking up things,
at my brother-in-law's funeral.

336
00:34:46,154 --> 00:34:46,737
-Which bracelet?
-My brown bracelet.

337
00:34:46,738 --> 00:34:47,113
-The one you usually wear?
-Yes.

338
00:34:49,199 --> 00:34:51,117
-The one you are wearing every day.
-Yes.

339
00:34:51,201 --> 00:34:52,368
Where did you go that day?

340
00:34:52,494 --> 00:34:55,746
I came to get medicine and a scarf in Noy's room.

341
00:34:55,914 --> 00:35:00,876
In that case, you may have dropped it upstairs.
Go there to look for it.

342
00:35:01,003 --> 00:35:03,838
If you can't find it. I'll help you look for it.

343
00:35:04,339 --> 00:35:06,006
Look well.

344
00:35:16,101 --> 00:35:17,893
-Min?
-Min?

345
00:35:26,027 --> 00:35:27,653
How are you?

346
00:35:28,989 --> 00:35:33,075
Did a strange voice call for you?

347
00:35:33,493 --> 00:35:35,786
Did you respond to it?

348
00:35:39,791 --> 00:35:42,334
-*.
-Nim, what are you doing with Min?

349
00:35:42,335 --> 00:35:45,296
Nothing. Just a greeting between aunt and niece.

350
00:35:45,672 --> 00:35:46,672
What did she ask?

351
00:35:47,007 --> 00:35:47,757
I told you there was nothing.

352
00:35:47,841 --> 00:35:49,884
-You called Nim, right?
-What are you talking about.

353
00:35:50,010 --> 00:35:54,055
She only came to find her
missing bracelet.

354
00:35:55,015 --> 00:35:56,098
I'll just go.

355
00:35:57,184 --> 00:35:58,225
Min, are you okay?

356
00:36:00,395 --> 00:36:01,771
What did your aunt say?

357
00:36:06,318 --> 00:36:07,818
What were you talking about?

358
00:36:11,573 --> 00:36:12,531
Min, what's wrong?

359
00:36:15,535 --> 00:36:16,494
Mom...

360
00:36:20,415 --> 00:36:21,457
Tell me.

361
00:36:21,792 --> 00:36:24,376
Mom, I don't want to be a shaman.

362
00:36:28,006 --> 00:36:31,634
I won't let you become a shaman.

363
00:36:32,636 --> 00:36:35,262
-Don't worry.
-Please help me.

364
00:36:35,263 --> 00:36:38,849
-Don't worry.
-Mom will help you.

365
00:36:39,559 --> 00:36:42,019
Why do you think Nim came to
look for Min?

366
00:36:42,604 --> 00:36:45,898
You think I will let my daughter,
become a shaman?

367
00:36:46,316 --> 00:36:48,275
Nim can't understand. Because
she doesn't have any children.

368
00:36:49,277 --> 00:36:53,030
No matter what, I won't let my daughter
become a shaman.

369
00:36:54,866 --> 00:36:58,494
Mrs. Gandalaya, please take your medicine at counter 2.

370
00:36:58,578 --> 00:37:00,746
Mother will get it for you.
Wait here.

371
00:37:00,831 --> 00:37:04,500
My head hurt so much, it felt like exploding.

372
00:37:04,584 --> 00:37:07,086
My stomach and back

373
00:37:07,254 --> 00:37:09,213
everything hurts.

374
00:37:10,924 --> 00:37:12,716
My vagina hurts too.

375
00:37:13,635 --> 00:37:16,303
It hurts so much that I can't pee.

376
00:37:18,390 --> 00:37:22,059
Even doctors can't help me.

377
00:37:22,394 --> 00:37:26,188
Have you had any strange dreams lately?

378
00:37:26,857 --> 00:37:30,109
I've had the same dream almost every night.

379
00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:35,614
There's a big man.

380
00:37:36,199 --> 00:37:38,075
With a body full of inscriptions.

381
00:37:38,076 --> 00:37:41,787
Wearing a traditional red vest and pants.

382
00:37:44,040 --> 00:37:45,583
In my dream...

383
00:37:47,043 --> 00:37:49,253
He holds a sword,

384
00:37:50,005 --> 00:37:52,339
With both legs dangling,

385
00:37:52,883 --> 00:37:55,926
His big tongue licked the tip of the sword.

386
00:37:57,721 --> 00:37:59,221
And also...

387
00:38:00,640 --> 00:38:05,561
Beneath him was a headless man,
covered in blood.

388
00:38:09,107 --> 00:38:13,235
The head seemed to want
to say something to me.

389
00:38:16,364 --> 00:38:18,699
What did he say?

390
00:38:21,203 --> 00:38:24,705
I tried to hear what
he had to say,

391
00:38:25,290 --> 00:38:27,833
But there was no sound.

392
00:39:43,743 --> 00:39:45,828
-Min?
-Are you okay?
-Leave me alone.

393
00:39:46,746 --> 00:39:49,999
This will end badly,
can you stand up?

394
00:39:50,500 --> 00:39:52,793
-Come on, stand up.
-Leave!

395
00:39:53,128 --> 00:39:55,754
We'd better go to the hospital.

396
00:39:55,755 --> 00:39:57,673
I told you to leave me alone.

397
00:40:02,846 --> 00:40:05,097
Hey, come with me for a second.

398
00:40:12,939 --> 00:40:14,690
Stop recording.

399
00:40:33,418 --> 00:40:34,835
You bastard, what are you saying?

400
00:40:36,504 --> 00:40:38,297
You want to fire me?

401
00:40:39,049 --> 00:40:40,215
Get lost!

402
00:41:09,412 --> 00:41:10,079
Min?

403
00:41:11,247 --> 00:41:13,374
-Did you take your medicine this morning?
-Min. Min.

404
00:41:14,125 --> 00:41:16,835
-Are you okay?
-Min, change your clothes here.

405
00:41:20,006 --> 00:41:21,507
I'll be waiting for you here.

406
00:41:22,133 --> 00:41:24,843
Okay everything is done,
let's fix your hair.

407
00:42:09,097 --> 00:42:10,139
Hey!

408
00:42:11,141 --> 00:42:12,182
Hey!

409
00:42:39,711 --> 00:42:40,335
Min!

410
00:42:40,628 --> 00:42:42,629
Your daughter is so pretty.

411
00:42:43,089 --> 00:42:47,134
Min!

412
00:42:48,136 --> 00:42:49,428
Your mother is here.

413
00:42:49,679 --> 00:42:52,222
Min!

414
00:42:52,265 --> 00:42:52,764
Min!

415
00:42:53,349 --> 00:42:54,558
She didn't look over here.

416
00:42:56,186 --> 00:42:56,768
Min.

417
00:43:58,206 --> 00:43:59,790
Where are you going?

418
00:44:01,042 --> 00:44:02,751
Going to work.

419
00:44:20,562 --> 00:44:22,312
What are you doing here?
Get out!

420
00:44:23,565 --> 00:44:26,233
Security, get her out!

421
00:44:31,990 --> 00:44:35,492
I've been missing something at work.

422
00:44:36,119 --> 00:44:38,328
So I went to check the CCTV to make sure.

423
00:44:39,205 --> 00:44:41,915
You know what I saw?

424
00:44:43,126 --> 00:44:45,502
Please see for yourself.

425
00:44:46,504 --> 00:44:48,255
This woman is outrageous.

426
00:46:57,385 --> 00:46:57,926
Min!

427
00:47:03,516 --> 00:47:04,307
Min?

428
00:47:07,019 --> 00:47:08,520
Are you taking a shower?

429
00:47:12,150 --> 00:47:12,691
Min!

430
00:47:14,026 --> 00:47:15,152
Min!

431
00:47:16,863 --> 00:47:17,529
Noy!

432
00:47:17,572 --> 00:47:18,655
Sweetie!

433
00:47:18,906 --> 00:47:20,615
Oh my god, what's going on?

434
00:47:20,992 --> 00:47:21,825
*!

435
00:47:24,871 --> 00:47:27,205
Don't just stand there, help.
Noy, call an ambulance.

436
00:47:27,498 --> 00:47:30,417
Hurry up and call an ambulance.

437
00:47:30,585 --> 00:47:31,585
*

438
00:47:31,586 --> 00:47:33,503
Are you alright?

439
00:47:33,588 --> 00:47:36,423
Send an ambulance immediately!

440
00:47:37,216 --> 00:47:39,009
Why are you here?

441
00:47:39,010 --> 00:47:40,427
What are doing?

442
00:48:06,996 --> 00:48:09,498
Nim, stop all this.

443
00:48:10,124 --> 00:48:12,709
She would accept the spirit of bayan.

444
00:48:13,377 --> 00:48:15,796
Can you do the inheritance ritual?

445
00:48:18,591 --> 00:48:21,510
I don't want to see my daughter like this.

446
00:48:21,928 --> 00:48:24,095
Min can't do the inheritance ritual.

447
00:48:25,640 --> 00:48:26,932
What do you mean?

448
00:48:29,268 --> 00:48:32,020
Because right now, it's not the spirit
of bayan in her body.

449
00:48:33,523 --> 00:48:35,232
Not bayan? What do you mean?

450
00:48:35,775 --> 00:48:39,236
Look at her symptoms,
haven't we experienced them before?

451
00:48:40,404 --> 00:48:44,115
Wouldn't she be cured if she
accepted bayan and become a shaman?

452
00:48:45,034 --> 00:48:47,244
Not like this.

453
00:48:48,579 --> 00:48:50,080
Please, don't be like this.

454
00:48:50,456 --> 00:48:52,207
Manit, come with me.

455
00:48:54,252 --> 00:48:55,794
I'll be right back, just wait.

456
00:48:56,504 --> 00:49:00,048
This is your niece. You have to help her.

457
00:49:00,758 --> 00:49:02,509
Don't you feel sorry for her?

458
00:49:11,561 --> 00:49:12,686
Open the door.

459
00:49:15,022 --> 00:49:16,314
Are you sure you want to open it?

460
00:49:16,315 --> 00:49:18,483
-Open the door.
-What are you going to do?

461
00:49:19,110 --> 00:49:20,402
Open it!

462
00:49:21,779 --> 00:49:23,071
Nothing will happen, right?

463
00:49:29,996 --> 00:49:31,621
Have you told Min?

464
00:49:59,692 --> 00:50:02,193
How did Mike die?

465
00:50:02,570 --> 00:50:04,988
Doesn't everyone know,
that he died in a motorcycle accident?

466
00:50:05,990 --> 00:50:07,532
I want to know the truth.

467
00:50:21,255 --> 00:50:26,259
Now I know what the relationship
between the two of them is.

468
00:50:33,017 --> 00:50:37,562
You know what happens to a soul
who commits suicide, right?

469
00:50:37,855 --> 00:50:38,939
Don't you know?

470
00:50:42,401 --> 00:50:44,694
Tell me where Mike killed himself.

471
00:50:58,416 --> 00:51:03,666
The entire Documentary Team
is confident in Nim's prediction,

472
00:51:03,690 --> 00:51:09,693
that something
else possessed Min.

473
00:51:12,598 --> 00:51:13,682
Just slowly.

474
00:51:14,100 --> 00:51:18,353
What will you do if Nim
refuses to perform the ritual?

475
00:51:18,813 --> 00:51:22,565
Even if she refuses, I will find a way.

476
00:51:28,489 --> 00:51:29,614
Although...

477
00:51:30,199 --> 00:51:33,284
It is against my beliefs.

478
00:51:35,287 --> 00:51:36,997
I have to do something.

479
00:52:13,284 --> 00:52:14,868
Mike!

480
00:52:14,869 --> 00:52:16,995
It's like a punishment to you, right?

481
00:52:17,913 --> 00:52:21,249
I know you like Min but you can't take her.

482
00:52:22,543 --> 00:52:24,002
Are you listening?

483
00:52:46,609 --> 00:52:48,318
Noy, do you really want to do this?

484
00:52:48,736 --> 00:52:50,612
Just drive the car.

485
00:53:16,722 --> 00:53:19,265
-*.
-Okay.

486
00:54:08,357 --> 00:54:10,275
Stop the ritual, I said stop!

487
00:54:10,651 --> 00:54:11,359
Stop!

488
00:54:11,735 --> 00:54:12,402
Nim!

489
00:54:13,487 --> 00:54:14,821
-Stop it!
-What are you doing?

490
00:54:15,656 --> 00:54:20,076
Do you know how dangerous this is,
what if another spirit will enter her body?

491
00:54:20,161 --> 00:54:22,245
Then what should I do?
My daughter is dying.

492
00:54:22,329 --> 00:54:23,496
-You don't care about her.
-What do you know?.

493
00:54:23,497 --> 00:54:24,998
Why can't I help you?

494
00:54:24,999 --> 00:54:26,833
-I have my way and I'll definitely help.
-What are you going to do?

495
00:54:26,917 --> 00:54:29,252
-Even then, how can you let this person
do the ritual?
-Should I just let my daughter die?

496
00:54:29,336 --> 00:54:30,587
Do you know this person?

497
00:54:32,047 --> 00:54:34,299
When will you do it?
After my daugther died?

498
00:54:36,552 --> 00:54:37,093
Min!

499
00:54:37,261 --> 00:54:38,803
Min, stop it!

500
00:54:41,098 --> 00:54:42,390
Stop it!

501
00:56:29,790 --> 00:56:31,916
Nim, what about Min?

502
00:56:32,918 --> 00:56:33,459
Where's Min?

503
00:56:33,711 --> 00:56:37,380
-Where did Min go?
-Lie down, take a rest first.

504
00:56:38,882 --> 00:56:39,590
Min.

505
00:56:39,591 --> 00:56:41,718
What about Min?

506
00:56:46,849 --> 00:56:47,932
My daugther Min.

507
00:56:48,058 --> 00:56:50,685
Nim, how long has she been like this?

508
00:56:53,272 --> 00:56:57,525
I have to find Min. Nim, you have to help me.

509
00:56:57,609 --> 00:57:01,195
In order for Min to return,
we have to perform a ritual.

510
00:57:04,992 --> 00:57:10,204
But first Noy has to accept the spirit of bayan.

511
00:57:10,748 --> 00:57:12,915
We have to ask for forgiveness from bayan.

512
00:57:13,751 --> 00:57:19,505
Even though Noy sinned by
rejecting the spirit of bayan.

513
00:57:20,591 --> 00:57:22,925
But I believe that Bayan is a merciful god.

514
00:57:23,010 --> 00:57:24,927
Put this on your head.

515
00:57:26,889 --> 00:57:31,351
If she means it, God will forgive her.

516
00:57:34,605 --> 00:57:36,606
Present the offerings.

517
00:57:50,829 --> 00:57:53,706
-What's that smell?
-Take a look.

518
00:57:55,751 --> 00:58:00,129
We have to collect the items Min collected.

519
00:58:00,339 --> 00:58:02,006
Because we'll use it for the ritual.

520
00:58:03,842 --> 00:58:05,885
What are these things?

521
00:58:06,011 --> 00:58:09,597
There are traces of spirits on these things.

522
00:58:09,598 --> 00:58:09,636
Min has been in contact with them.

523
00:58:09,636 --> 00:58:12,392
The Evil Spirit sensed Mike's possessive
feelings, and used them to deceive Min.
Min has been in contact with them.

524
00:58:12,393 --> 00:58:12,430
Nim look at this. God, why did she put it there?
The Evil Spirit sensed Mike's possessive
feelings, and used them to deceive Min.

525
00:58:12,430 --> 00:58:15,937
Nim look at this. God, why did she put it there?

526
00:58:24,404 --> 00:58:26,197
These are her baby shoes.

527
00:58:30,744 --> 00:58:32,537
-Nim
-Yes?

528
00:58:34,915 --> 00:58:38,042
Also look around the house,
everything has to be removed.

529
00:58:41,422 --> 00:58:44,757
We have to perform the ritual where Mike killed himself.

530
00:58:49,012 --> 00:58:52,557
I will pray for Min, that Mike doesn't hurt her.

531
00:58:54,143 --> 00:58:58,521
I will let Mike know that Min loves him too.

532
00:58:58,522 --> 00:59:02,024
I know Mike, you're angry and
want to take revenge against your family.

533
00:59:02,484 --> 00:59:04,986
But I won't let anything happen to Min.

534
00:59:31,054 --> 00:59:36,142
I don't know how long the ritual will last.

535
00:59:37,227 --> 00:59:40,479
I might have to spend a few days and nights,

536
00:59:40,480 --> 00:59:42,982
Until I know where Min went.

537
00:59:50,616 --> 00:59:55,786
A taxi driver came with his dashboard camera
after he heard the news.

538
00:59:56,330 --> 00:59:59,624
He picked up Min around 3am.

539
01:00:00,709 --> 01:00:04,420
After getting in the car, the driver asked
where she was going, but she didn't answer.

540
01:00:05,631 --> 01:00:08,007
Let's take a look at the video.

541
01:00:11,011 --> 01:00:11,761
Ma'am,

542
01:00:15,682 --> 01:00:16,516
Where are you going?

543
01:00:17,768 --> 01:00:18,434
Ma'am?

544
01:00:19,186 --> 01:00:20,519
Ma'am? Has she gone mad?

545
01:00:21,063 --> 01:00:22,313
I'm leaving.

546
01:00:33,033 --> 01:00:33,991
What is this.

547
01:00:35,035 --> 01:00:36,035
Oh my god.

548
01:00:41,875 --> 01:00:44,001
I don't know if the video is faulty or not.
Anyway, I've sent it to the forensic team.

549
01:00:44,545 --> 01:00:46,712
But I don't think
we can find her either.

550
01:00:48,090 --> 01:00:51,634
If there's any news, we'll let you know.

551
01:01:11,989 --> 01:01:13,739
I am worried about my daughter's condition.

552
01:01:13,740 --> 01:01:17,159
I don't know if she's still alive.

553
01:01:17,369 --> 01:01:19,412
*

554
01:01:19,913 --> 01:01:21,038
I can only pray,

555
01:01:21,498 --> 01:01:24,750
to God or Buddha.

556
01:01:25,836 --> 01:01:28,337
To return my daughter.

557
01:01:48,150 --> 01:01:50,067
I've been everywhere.

558
01:01:50,485 --> 01:01:53,529
The house of her friend, ex-boyfriend, all of them.

559
01:01:53,530 --> 01:01:55,781
But no one saw her.

560
01:01:55,866 --> 01:01:58,117
I've used all the ways
for chanting and praying.

561
01:01:58,910 --> 01:02:00,828
If praying would solve everything,
I would have done it a long time ago.

562
01:02:01,390 --> 01:02:05,413
Dog Meat Shop

563
01:02:05,515 --> 01:02:09,110
Temporarily closed for repair

564
01:02:14,843 --> 01:02:16,344
Eever since Min disappeared, my family's
situation has gotten worse.

565
01:02:17,554 --> 01:02:19,513
One of them is Noy,
she doesn't eat and sleep.

566
01:02:19,806 --> 01:02:23,351
It's been a month, but you
still haven't found a clue?

567
01:02:23,352 --> 01:02:25,186
You just sit here and eat the tax dollars we pay.

568
01:02:25,187 --> 01:02:27,146
-It's not like that, sir.
-You're all the same!

569
01:02:27,147 --> 01:02:28,731
It's been a month...

570
01:02:28,732 --> 01:02:30,816
And you just sit here quietly.

571
01:02:30,817 --> 01:02:32,485
We've been looking for clues.

572
01:02:32,486 --> 01:02:34,070
-What are you guys doing here?
-Everyone's working.

573
01:02:34,071 --> 01:02:36,656
Then why are you just sitting
here like an idiot.

574
01:02:36,657 --> 01:02:38,491
All I see is that you're all
just sitting here.

575
01:02:38,492 --> 01:02:40,660
No clues,

576
01:02:41,036 --> 01:02:43,037
No news,

577
01:02:44,164 --> 01:02:46,457
at all.

578
01:03:08,939 --> 01:03:10,773
I was fooled by their trick.

579
01:03:12,150 --> 01:03:15,277
Actually this has nothing
to do with Mike.

580
01:03:15,278 --> 01:03:17,238
Then who kidnapped Min?

581
01:04:38,017 --> 01:04:41,524
Yasantia Spinning Factory

582
01:05:57,524 --> 01:05:58,357
Min?

583
01:06:10,912 --> 01:06:12,121
Min, wake up!

584
01:06:15,292 --> 01:06:17,710
Her fever has gone down.

585
01:06:17,794 --> 01:06:20,254
But there are symptoms of dehydration and malnutrition.

586
01:06:20,338 --> 01:06:23,757
And some minor bruises and abrasions.

587
01:06:24,384 --> 01:06:27,678
Will she be okay?

588
01:06:28,388 --> 01:06:31,849
We'll check her again
after she regains consciousness.

589
01:06:34,144 --> 01:06:37,354
Now everything is clear.

590
01:06:40,066 --> 01:06:42,234
At least Min wasn't badly injured.

591
01:06:43,069 --> 01:06:45,321
I will go to the mountains again.

592
01:06:48,408 --> 01:06:51,118
To pray and make offerings to Bayan.

593
01:07:22,525 --> 01:07:25,486
God, Who would do such a thing?

594
01:07:52,097 --> 01:07:55,349
Where have you been all this time?

595
01:08:02,023 --> 01:08:04,233
At least eat a little.

596
01:08:07,779 --> 01:08:10,030
Food won't even go into her mouth.

597
01:08:12,191 --> 01:08:19,901
Currently Min is possessed
by an unknown spirit.

598
01:08:29,342 --> 01:08:30,884
Who are you?

599
01:08:34,514 --> 01:08:36,223
I ask. who are you really?

600
01:08:47,652 --> 01:08:49,486
I am Bayan.

601
01:08:52,115 --> 01:08:53,824
I will ask you again, who are you?

602
01:08:54,576 --> 01:08:58,328
Guess, who I really am.

603
01:08:59,497 --> 01:09:00,789
Guess...

604
01:09:07,672 --> 01:09:09,298
Min, don't do this.

605
01:09:13,511 --> 01:09:15,846
Have you gone mad? Why would
you do this?

606
01:09:16,514 --> 01:09:18,015
Why is she like this?

607
01:09:21,853 --> 01:09:24,104
You like vaginas, don't you?

608
01:09:24,105 --> 01:09:25,856
You really like it.

609
01:09:26,191 --> 01:09:27,357
Min, don't do this.

610
01:09:28,234 --> 01:09:29,860
Stop it, Min!

611
01:09:30,028 --> 01:09:31,528
-Hold her.
-Let me go.

612
01:09:31,613 --> 01:09:33,280
-Hold her.
-Let me go.

613
01:09:34,783 --> 01:09:36,617
-Grab her.
-Take it off.

614
01:09:37,160 --> 01:09:39,078
-Hold her properly!
-Take it off.

615
01:09:39,079 --> 01:09:40,537
Grab her, quick!

616
01:09:41,498 --> 01:09:43,832
Dip her finger in the glass.

617
01:09:58,306 --> 01:09:59,890
Do you know,

618
01:10:00,558 --> 01:10:02,601
why you're a shaman?

619
01:10:02,936 --> 01:10:05,562
It's all because of your dear sister.

620
01:10:06,564 --> 01:10:09,983
She wears her best clothes
for your every day.

621
01:10:10,485 --> 01:10:13,862
She even put a talisman in your shoe.

622
01:10:13,905 --> 01:10:16,198
She does everything

623
01:10:16,199 --> 01:10:19,284
for you, to replace her as a shaman.

624
01:10:19,702 --> 01:10:21,203
Did you know that?

625
01:10:44,519 --> 01:10:48,188
Find something to tie her up, quick.

626
01:10:51,276 --> 01:10:52,234
Hurry up.

627
01:10:53,069 --> 01:10:56,238
Hurry up. Once you're done,
go outside.

628
01:10:56,406 --> 01:11:00,367
Don't record it before going out.

629
01:11:00,743 --> 01:11:02,035
Go!

630
01:11:19,345 --> 01:11:21,555
I need someone's help.

631
01:11:24,017 --> 01:11:25,684
Nim, about what Min said earlier.

632
01:11:29,022 --> 01:11:30,397
Please forgive me.

633
01:11:31,441 --> 01:11:34,651
Don't worry. No matter what happens,
I will save my niece.

634
01:13:26,764 --> 01:13:29,391
Santi, you're still doing this
embarrassing ritual, apparently.

635
01:13:31,519 --> 01:13:33,103
I also have to live.

636
01:13:43,072 --> 01:13:46,158
Min, wait a moment...

637
01:13:47,285 --> 01:13:50,078
She's possessed by a strange spirit, right?

638
01:13:56,419 --> 01:13:58,128
Her condition now,

639
01:13:59,714 --> 01:14:04,801
is like a car that's out of control.

640
01:14:07,221 --> 01:14:10,140
-Who exactly possessed her?
-She's not alone.

641
01:14:12,143 --> 01:14:14,144
I don't know who they are.

642
01:14:15,104 --> 01:14:17,731
It's too many to count.

643
01:14:19,233 --> 01:14:23,111
I can only feel their presence.

644
01:14:23,821 --> 01:14:26,031
Evil spirit with all kinds of resentment.

645
01:14:35,708 --> 01:14:41,046
They collect all the evil spirits
and even the unfortunate souls

646
01:14:41,047 --> 01:14:43,006
which turned into a beast spirit.

647
01:14:48,598 --> 01:14:51,106
From the Dog Spirit,

648
01:14:51,122 --> 01:14:52,122
Centipede,

649
01:14:53,083 --> 01:14:54,020
Spider,

650
01:14:55,770 --> 01:14:57,771
To the spirit of nautre.

651
01:14:59,357 --> 01:15:05,320
A powerful evil spirit,
that fuses all spirits together.

652
01:15:11,994 --> 01:15:14,538
This is where Min was found.

653
01:15:18,501 --> 01:15:20,377
The exorcism must be performed here.

654
01:15:22,130 --> 01:15:24,673
All the evil spirits gathered here for Min.

655
01:15:25,007 --> 01:15:29,678
When the Evil Spirit is removed, so will
the Evil Spirit in Min's body.

656
01:15:30,221 --> 01:15:32,013
Why did it choose Min?

657
01:15:40,815 --> 01:15:45,152
Have you heard of your husband's ancestors?

658
01:15:47,488 --> 01:15:51,575
How many people were killed by Willow's ancestors.

659
01:15:53,035 --> 01:15:56,621
A dying man cursed this family.

660
01:15:58,916 --> 01:16:01,001
The curse is passed down from generation to generation.

661
01:16:01,002 --> 01:16:03,211
That's why Willow married you.

662
01:16:04,005 --> 01:16:07,257
The one who rejected Bayan.

663
01:16:14,390 --> 01:16:15,849
After that,

664
01:16:18,019 --> 01:16:20,604
Everything has been decided.

665
01:16:21,314 --> 01:16:23,857
One must be sacrificed to do penance.

666
01:16:23,858 --> 01:16:25,984
And that person is Min.

667
01:16:37,705 --> 01:16:39,539
Do you believe?

668
01:16:42,084 --> 01:16:45,003
That all of this is fate.

669
01:16:47,048 --> 01:16:50,300
You don't have to worry,
the day of the exorcism will soon be determined.

670
01:16:50,801 --> 01:16:52,511
Who decides?

671
01:16:53,804 --> 01:16:55,013
God?

672
01:16:55,515 --> 01:16:56,848
Buddha?

673
01:16:57,183 --> 01:16:59,518
Which one?

674
01:17:01,896 --> 01:17:07,067
Why should my daughter pay,
for the karma accumulated by my ancestor?

675
01:17:07,068 --> 01:17:09,236
Why can't it be just me?

676
01:17:17,119 --> 01:17:18,537
Sit down for a while.

677
01:17:21,958 --> 01:17:24,000
Don't think too much.

678
01:17:25,127 --> 01:17:27,796
Min will recover once her exorcism is complete.

679
01:17:28,172 --> 01:17:30,257
Bayan will help us.

680
01:17:32,260 --> 01:17:37,430
When I was sick, people said that Bayan wanted to possess me.

681
01:17:38,516 --> 01:17:43,103
But I felt nothing, except pain.

682
01:17:46,023 --> 01:17:47,899
May I ask you?

683
01:17:49,652 --> 01:17:51,903
Have you met the spirit of Bayan?

684
01:17:53,489 --> 01:17:55,657
Do you believe Bayan is real?

685
01:17:56,742 --> 01:18:00,620
-Of course.
-Have you seen him with your own eyes?

686
01:18:07,211 --> 01:18:11,840
-Not yet.
-How can you believe in it?

687
01:18:16,220 --> 01:18:18,138
I can only feel it. I feel his presence.

688
01:18:24,895 --> 01:18:29,816
If we believe, Bayan will help us.

689
01:18:48,169 --> 01:18:49,502
Prepare yourself for the ritual.

690
01:18:49,587 --> 01:18:53,548
This evil spirit is very strong,
we must be prepared.

691
01:18:54,550 --> 01:19:00,513
We also need a lot of amulets and spells.

692
01:19:04,644 --> 01:19:07,896
In order to maximize my strength, I have to
extert it on a wooden stick.

693
01:19:10,900 --> 01:19:15,070
Just in case I prepared a lot of alcohol and incense.

694
01:19:16,405 --> 01:19:19,491
And he most important thing is that I have to do this ritual with Nim.

695
01:19:20,409 --> 01:19:25,288
We must unite. Even though,
it's difficult we have to try.

696
01:19:25,873 --> 01:19:27,999
I've been doing this for a long time,
but this ritual is still challenging.

697
01:19:28,209 --> 01:19:30,335
I want to see how strong the evil spirit is.

698
01:19:37,760 --> 01:19:39,928
She doesn't even want to eat right now.

699
01:19:40,846 --> 01:19:43,431
I tried to talk to her but
she did not respond.

700
01:19:45,226 --> 01:19:47,143
I am so worried.

701
01:19:49,522 --> 01:19:54,150
Nim didn't stop by because she's
busy preparing for the exorcism.

702
01:19:54,485 --> 01:19:59,072
Every morning things
in the house are scattered.

703
01:20:00,408 --> 01:20:01,241
And I think Min did it.

704
01:20:03,160 --> 01:20:07,872
I know that it is Min who does this
every night but why.

705
01:20:09,191 --> 01:20:12,980
The documentary team installed
cameras at the house,

706
01:20:13,004 --> 01:20:17,398
to find out what Min
is doing every night.

707
01:20:24,393 --> 01:20:28,259
6 Days before the exorcism.

708
01:21:18,203 --> 01:21:19,871
What's up Lucky?

709
01:22:00,689 --> 01:22:04,188
5 Days before the exorcism.

710
01:22:53,298 --> 01:22:56,918
4 Days before the exorcism.

711
01:23:24,697 --> 01:23:27,852
3 Days before the exorcism

712
01:23:28,032 --> 01:23:30,617
If that's the case, stop recording.

713
01:23:30,618 --> 01:23:33,036
-Sir, please.
-Stop it, all of you just leave.

714
01:23:33,037 --> 01:23:35,079
Please wait until it's finished.

715
01:23:35,998 --> 01:23:37,206
-Look a little more.
-What is goig on?

716
01:23:47,676 --> 01:23:49,302
Why her?

717
01:23:57,936 --> 01:24:01,105
If things are like this,
shouldn't we just leave.

718
01:24:04,485 --> 01:24:06,611
If you want to leave, please.

719
01:24:07,363 --> 01:24:09,781
I will stay with with my daughter.

720
01:24:11,950 --> 01:24:15,536
Honestly, I was afraid to watch it.

721
01:24:17,873 --> 01:24:19,749
But she is still my daughter.

722
01:24:21,919 --> 01:24:26,839
Nim, will help her to recover.

723
01:24:28,676 --> 01:24:31,636
Nim, is well known, she's
helped a lot of people.

724
01:24:31,929 --> 01:24:35,056
She can definitely save Min, right?

725
01:24:38,889 --> 01:24:48,665
After seeing Min's behavior, her family
agreed to put in an extra camera.

726
01:26:09,568 --> 01:26:11,194
Why does my stomache hurt?

727
01:26:26,008 --> 01:26:29,406
2 Days before the exorcism.

728
01:26:33,425 --> 01:26:36,427
Finished. Now she can't get in.

729
01:26:38,514 --> 01:26:40,014
Not even through our dreams.

730
01:26:40,099 --> 01:26:42,308
Alright, let's grab
something to eat.

731
01:27:23,934 --> 01:27:27,103
- Min!
- Hey, Get up!

732
01:28:01,263 --> 01:28:02,388
Disgusting.

733
01:28:54,316 --> 01:28:56,609
Pon!

734
01:28:58,487 --> 01:29:00,488
Pon!

735
01:29:01,490 --> 01:29:02,698
Where's Pon!?

736
01:29:02,783 --> 01:29:04,825
-What's wrong?
-Min took my son.

737
01:29:04,910 --> 01:29:06,994
-Hah?
-Min took my son.

738
01:29:07,037 --> 01:29:09,497
-Where did she take him?
-Hurry up, find her!

739
01:29:09,539 --> 01:29:12,500
-Min took my son.
-Where did Min take him?

740
01:29:14,044 --> 01:29:15,753
Quick, find her!

741
01:29:19,216 --> 01:29:23,094
Why is Min doing this,
quickly find her!

742
01:29:25,222 --> 01:29:28,432
You're crazy, why did you take my son!

743
01:29:36,525 --> 01:29:38,776
-Have you seen Min?
-I didn't see her.

744
01:29:47,661 --> 01:29:50,913
Min, damn you.

745
01:29:50,998 --> 01:29:55,042
Min, where are you?

746
01:30:34,499 --> 01:30:36,083
-Pon!
-Don't worry mother is here.

747
01:31:42,526 --> 01:31:44,235
Min, wake up!

748
01:31:48,824 --> 01:31:51,033
Min, Min? Let him go.

749
01:32:00,815 --> 01:32:06,396
1 Day before the exorcism.

750
01:32:17,936 --> 01:32:19,270
Nim!

751
01:32:20,647 --> 01:32:23,816
-Is something wrong?
-Why aren't you returning my calls?

752
01:32:24,192 --> 01:32:26,986
I heard a voice, but no one answered.

753
01:32:27,696 --> 01:32:30,531
-Is anyone there?
-Yes.

754
01:32:35,203 --> 01:32:37,830
Nim!

755
01:32:39,249 --> 01:32:41,792
-Nim!
-Are you there?

756
01:32:55,056 --> 01:32:56,724
What's this?

757
01:32:58,768 --> 01:33:00,811
Nim! Nim!

758
01:33:06,234 --> 01:33:09,403
Nim, wake up!

759
01:33:10,405 --> 01:33:12,198
You over there, help her.

760
01:33:13,325 --> 01:33:16,493
Nim died while sleeping.
Doctors to not know the cause of death.

761
01:33:39,226 --> 01:33:41,894
Because of me, Nim is dead.

762
01:33:43,772 --> 01:33:46,815
Eveyrthing that happend to Min,
it's my fault.

763
01:33:47,734 --> 01:33:50,110
I have nobody else.

764
01:33:52,572 --> 01:33:57,159
All I can do now is protect my daughter.

765
01:33:58,161 --> 01:34:00,162
I'm willing to die for her.

766
01:34:02,249 --> 01:34:05,709
Why did Nim die? She must
have been killed by the evil spirit, right?

767
01:34:07,504 --> 01:34:11,173
We can't do anything.

768
01:34:14,094 --> 01:34:15,261
What did you say?

769
01:34:15,262 --> 01:34:18,138
What do you mean?

770
01:34:19,015 --> 01:34:20,391
Master, what are we going to do?

771
01:34:20,767 --> 01:34:24,520
Don't worry. The ritual will
be carried out tomorrow.Just
follow my orders.

772
01:34:32,600 --> 01:34:37,602
Day of the exorcism.

773
01:34:56,219 --> 01:34:58,262
-Here?
-Yes, just put it there.

774
01:34:58,722 --> 01:35:02,308
Guru Santi, can you explain the procedure of
the ritual today?

775
01:35:03,518 --> 01:35:07,771
I will hold the ritual on the 5th floor.

776
01:35:09,107 --> 01:35:12,651
By inviting the evil spirit in Min's body.

777
01:35:33,840 --> 01:35:37,092
I will lure them out.

778
01:35:38,261 --> 01:35:41,347
Then I will put the spirit in a jar.

779
01:35:41,348 --> 01:35:44,933
After the spirit is sealed,
I will bury the jar in a secluded place.

780
01:35:45,143 --> 01:35:48,145
And bury everything related to the spirit.

781
01:35:48,146 --> 01:35:50,564
Based on what happened to Nim,

782
01:35:50,607 --> 01:35:53,859
Isn't it to dangerous to perform the ritual?

783
01:35:54,527 --> 01:35:55,653
Right.

784
01:35:57,614 --> 01:36:00,991
But you've seen what's on the back of Manit's car?

785
01:36:01,660 --> 01:36:05,913
There's a sticker that says "this car is red".

786
01:36:06,116 --> 01:36:10,001
This car is red

787
01:36:10,001 --> 01:36:10,069
What does it have to do with the ritual?
This car is red

788
01:36:10,069 --> 01:36:13,253
What does it have to do with the ritual?

789
01:36:37,153 --> 01:36:42,699
No one should leave this place
until the ritual is over.

790
01:38:13,708 --> 01:38:15,000
Come!

791
01:39:08,012 --> 01:39:09,596
Come!

792
01:39:24,612 --> 01:39:26,196
Who's knocking?

793
01:39:29,659 --> 01:39:30,993
I dont' know.

794
01:40:13,912 --> 01:40:14,828
Noy!

795
01:40:15,580 --> 01:40:15,913
Noy!

796
01:40:18,374 --> 01:40:19,291
-Noy
-Are you okay?

797
01:40:19,292 --> 01:40:21,585
-She passed out.
-Let's rest for a while.

798
01:40:22,295 --> 01:40:23,128
Noy!

799
01:40:27,133 --> 01:40:27,633
Noy, are you alright?

800
01:40:27,634 --> 01:40:30,427
Can you hear me?

801
01:40:41,439 --> 01:40:43,523
Is anyone there?

802
01:40:45,151 --> 01:40:46,860
Why did you lock me up?

803
01:40:48,112 --> 01:40:52,324
Mom, are you outside? Please open the door.

804
01:40:52,659 --> 01:40:53,992
Has the spirit gone?

805
01:40:55,244 --> 01:40:56,495
Who knows.

806
01:40:57,163 --> 01:40:59,498
-Aunt.
-Min?

807
01:40:59,916 --> 01:41:01,750
Please open the door.

808
01:41:01,751 --> 01:41:04,378
Min, are you okay?

809
01:41:05,630 --> 01:41:06,797
Open the door.

810
01:41:06,798 --> 01:41:07,923
Are you quiet?

811
01:41:08,508 --> 01:41:11,093
Aunt, I beg you, please open the door.

812
01:41:11,094 --> 01:41:12,135
I don't know.

813
01:41:12,136 --> 01:41:14,805
The guru said that not to open the door,
until the ritual is over.

814
01:41:14,806 --> 01:41:17,057
-Open the door for me.
-Min.

815
01:41:17,558 --> 01:41:21,269
Aunt, I'm locked up, please open the door.

816
01:41:21,938 --> 01:41:25,023
-Wait a minute.
-Mom, please open the door.

817
01:41:25,274 --> 01:41:26,984
They haven't contacted me.

818
01:41:27,193 --> 01:41:30,988
Bi, where did everyone go?

819
01:41:32,115 --> 01:41:34,032
Please open the door

820
01:41:48,506 --> 01:41:49,798
Min, are you okay?

821
01:42:26,544 --> 01:42:28,211
Open the door, my son inside.

822
01:42:28,212 --> 01:42:29,546
-No.
-Open the door.

823
01:42:29,547 --> 01:42:32,883
-I said my son is inside.
-Don't.

824
01:42:33,342 --> 01:42:35,427
My son is inside.

825
01:42:35,636 --> 01:42:38,764
What are you talking about?
He's still in his bed.

826
01:42:38,848 --> 01:42:41,349
He's in there, can't you hear him?

827
01:42:51,319 --> 01:42:55,489
-My son is inside.
-The Guru said, the door must not be opened.

828
01:42:55,490 --> 01:42:58,617
-Please, check again.
-Min, please return Pon.

829
01:42:59,494 --> 01:43:00,368
Open the door.

830
01:43:00,495 --> 01:43:01,995
-I told you, I can't.
-Open the door.

831
01:43:02,038 --> 01:43:03,288
No, please check again.

832
01:43:03,372 --> 01:43:05,415
Open the door.

833
01:43:05,500 --> 01:43:08,043
-Look at the bed again.
-Oh.

834
01:43:09,170 --> 01:43:10,003
-Hah?
-Open the door.

835
01:43:10,546 --> 01:43:11,213
Ma'am,

836
01:43:15,259 --> 01:43:16,134
you can't!

837
01:43:18,805 --> 01:43:20,138
Ma'am, wake up!

838
01:43:20,431 --> 01:43:22,140
Pon! Pon!

839
01:44:03,891 --> 01:44:05,350
Master, what's wrong?

840
01:44:12,942 --> 01:44:13,733
Master.

841
01:44:20,908 --> 01:44:21,700
Master!

842
01:44:22,869 --> 01:44:23,785
What happened?

843
01:44:23,870 --> 01:44:26,538
Master!

844
01:44:28,708 --> 01:44:29,499
Master!

845
01:44:39,552 --> 01:44:40,510
Master!

846
01:44:43,598 --> 01:44:44,514
Master!

847
01:44:52,106 --> 01:44:53,356
Master, what's wrong with you?

848
01:45:06,078 --> 01:45:07,287
Master!

849
01:45:19,592 --> 01:45:21,176
Min, where is my son?

850
01:46:15,106 --> 01:46:18,525
Damn, open the door. Please open the door!

851
01:46:18,859 --> 01:46:19,609
Help me!

852
01:46:20,361 --> 01:46:22,862
Help!

853
01:46:24,156 --> 01:46:25,490
Help me!

854
01:46:30,079 --> 01:46:31,121
The door won't open.

855
01:46:32,873 --> 01:46:33,748
No!

856
01:47:09,827 --> 01:47:10,660
What happend?

857
01:47:16,584 --> 01:47:18,793
Why is the light off?

858
01:47:21,130 --> 01:47:23,298
Turn on the camera light.

859
01:47:28,763 --> 01:47:31,222
Damn, where did everyone go?

860
01:47:37,146 --> 01:47:40,398
Hello, what happened?
Where did everyone gone?

861
01:47:52,286 --> 01:47:52,994
Sir?

862
01:47:54,663 --> 01:47:55,580
Let's just go.

863
01:48:22,525 --> 01:48:24,234
I can't see anything.

864
01:48:52,513 --> 01:48:53,513
Oh shit.

865
01:49:32,511 --> 01:49:33,178
Oh lord.

866
01:50:09,632 --> 01:50:10,340
Sweetie!

867
01:50:15,846 --> 01:50:16,221
Noy!

868
01:50:20,392 --> 01:50:21,351
Are you okay?

869
01:50:23,020 --> 01:50:23,937
Are you hurt?

870
01:50:25,272 --> 01:50:26,397
I can feel it.

871
01:50:28,359 --> 01:50:30,527
The spirit of Bayan is with us.

872
01:50:34,490 --> 01:50:37,325
Bayan is with me.

873
01:50:37,660 --> 01:50:40,703
Bayan watched me.

874
01:51:01,767 --> 01:51:04,227
The ritual must continue.

875
01:51:04,561 --> 01:51:07,188
Collect the broken jar.

876
01:51:08,524 --> 01:51:12,026
We have to lock up the evil spirit again.

877
01:51:14,572 --> 01:51:16,030
Find it, quickly.

878
01:52:24,808 --> 01:52:26,351
Get the incense.

879
01:53:56,066 --> 01:53:59,193
Do you want me to record you?

880
01:54:24,303 --> 01:54:27,096
Why is the incense upside down?

881
01:54:44,740 --> 01:54:46,032
Don't

882
01:55:39,378 --> 01:55:41,170
Uncle, uncle!

883
01:55:41,922 --> 01:55:42,839
No!

884
01:56:28,760 --> 01:56:30,595
Evil spirit!

885
01:56:30,596 --> 01:56:32,513
Get out of my daughter's body!

886
01:56:32,514 --> 01:56:37,018
By the power of Bayan, you shall be crushed.

887
01:57:06,590 --> 01:57:07,882
Is it you, Min?

888
01:58:16,410 --> 01:58:18,035
Give me back my daughter.

889
01:58:19,496 --> 01:58:21,497
Give her back!

890
01:58:23,041 --> 01:58:24,275
I said give her back!

891
01:59:01,913 --> 01:59:04,081
Min do you hear mom's voice?

892
01:59:04,791 --> 01:59:06,917
Are you still there?

893
01:59:09,546 --> 01:59:13,340
Don't be like this, to mother.

894
01:59:14,593 --> 01:59:17,344
Min are you listening?

895
01:59:17,846 --> 01:59:20,681
Min, mother was guilty.

896
01:59:22,309 --> 01:59:24,310
Mother was wrong.

897
01:59:24,853 --> 01:59:26,854
Come back.

898
01:59:30,609 --> 01:59:33,861
Oh god, please save Min.

899
01:59:36,740 --> 01:59:38,240
Please save my daughter.

900
01:59:56,760 --> 02:00:00,100
Min don't give up.

901
02:00:02,015 --> 02:00:07,937
Min, don't, don't do this to mom.

902
02:00:16,606 --> 02:00:32,718
Yasantia

903
02:00:41,292 --> 02:00:48,204
Nim's last interview.

904
02:00:57,112 --> 02:00:59,488
What happened at the altar earlier?

905
02:01:04,744 --> 02:01:10,708
I'm afraid the exorcism ritual,
won't work.

906
02:01:12,544 --> 02:01:16,714
So what? Haven't the preperations
been completed?

907
02:01:19,509 --> 02:01:21,927
Maybe it's all useless.

908
02:01:23,388 --> 02:01:26,056
What does it mean?

909
02:01:44,993 --> 02:01:46,619
To be honest,

910
02:01:52,083 --> 02:01:54,501
I don't know either.

911
02:01:55,629 --> 02:01:58,797
I was never sure,

912
02:02:00,258 --> 02:02:03,677
that Bayan really existed in my body.

913
02:02:04,429 --> 02:02:06,555
You mean?

914
02:02:08,850 --> 02:02:11,518
I don't know either.
