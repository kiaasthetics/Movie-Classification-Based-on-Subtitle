I knew you are
a big fixer upper, Jules

but this is worse than
I could have ever imagined.

5
00:00:52,953 --> 00:00:54,887
But it's our song.

6
00:00:54,922 --> 00:00:57,957
Since, since when do we
have a song?

7
00:00:57,992 --> 00:01:00,793
- Turn that, turn it down.
- No.

8
00:01:00,828 --> 00:01:03,131
I think I should
probably get a say

9
00:01:03,170 --> 00:01:04,997
if this is our song,
don't you think?

10
00:01:05,032 --> 00:01:07,299
- No.
- This is it. This is our song.

11
00:01:07,334 --> 00:01:09,501
- Get real.
- I mean it.

12
00:01:16,444 --> 00:01:20,467
Oh, my God! Jackie,
this place is incredible.

13
00:01:20,567 --> 00:01:22,735
Wasn't kidding when I said
it was rustic.

14
00:01:22,817 --> 00:01:24,683
Where'd you say
the infinity pool was?

15
00:01:24,719 --> 00:01:27,520
Oh, yeah. No, that would be

Hmm.

18
00:01:35,464 --> 00:01:37,381
I have a confession to make.

19
00:01:38,037 --> 00:01:40,504
I think I love this place
more than you.

20
00:01:42,749 --> 00:01:44,548
That wouldn't surprise me.

21
00:01:50,611 --> 00:01:53,779
I mean, I could never,
but it's close, like,

22
00:01:54,031 --> 00:01:55,529
really close.

23
00:01:57,851 --> 00:02:00,486
Okay, you go explore
and I'll make, I'll make dinner.

24
00:02:00,522 --> 00:02:02,488
Mm-hmm. Yeah, you will.

25
00:02:03,703 --> 00:02:06,521
So my great-great grandpa..

26
00:02:06,795 --> 00:02:09,195
...he got super lucky and, uh...

27
00:02:09,230 --> 00:02:11,397
after Canada confederated

28
00:02:11,432 --> 00:02:14,500
the government was giving people
around here land for free

29
00:02:14,535 --> 00:02:16,401
if they promised
that they would farm it..

30
00:02:17,939 --> 00:02:20,248
...and years later
he built this place.

31
00:02:20,622 --> 00:02:22,622
So can we just live here
forever?

32
00:02:31,819 --> 00:02:33,619

anywhere?

37
00:02:44,999 --> 00:02:46,765
Alright!

38
00:02:51,453 --> 00:02:52,952
Let there be light.

00:02:57,178 --> 00:02:58,610

Oh.

Hey. Sorry.

- Nothin'.

God, it's been
a really long time.

I -- I didn't even know
that you still came around here.

Sarah. Yeah.

111
00:08:35,954 --> 00:08:37,287
It's been..

112
00:08:38,796 --> 00:08:39,995
...forever.

113
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:41,453
Yeah.

114
00:08:42,216 --> 00:08:43,344
Hi.

115
00:08:44,249 --> 00:08:47,584
- Hi.
- This is Julie. My... my wife.

116
00:08:48,729 --> 00:08:51,096
Sarah. It's really nice
to meet you.

117
00:08:51,279 --> 00:08:52,712
Uh, sorry to come by so late.

118
00:08:52,797 --> 00:08:54,600
No, that's okay, we were just..

119
00:08:54,787 --> 00:08:56,120
...having a drink.

120
00:08:56,156 --> 00:08:58,871
I -- I just, I hadn't seen
lights on over here in ages.

121
00:08:58,906 --> 00:09:00,239
We got broken into last summer

122
00:09:00,274 --> 00:09:02,307
so I thought I should come by
and check the place out.

123
00:09:02,342 --> 00:09:04,109
You have a place
around here too?

124
00:09:04,144 --> 00:09:06,712
Yeah! Yeah just on
the other side of the lake.

125
00:09:06,747 --> 00:09:08,647
Megan and I used to get into
all kinds of trouble

126
00:09:08,682 --> 00:09:10,348
around here as kids.

127
00:09:12,486 --> 00:09:13,718
Is that right..

128
00:09:14,814 --> 00:09:16,314
...Megan?

129
00:09:18,167 --> 00:09:20,367
Well, I should,
I should get going. Um..

130
00:09:21,028 --> 00:09:22,194
You guys have a great night.

131
00:09:22,229 --> 00:09:24,141
Yeah, have a good night, Sarah.

132
00:09:24,620 --> 00:09:26,153
It's really good
to see you again.

133
00:09:28,866 --> 00:09:30,232
See you around.

134
00:09:34,925 --> 00:09:36,336
I can explain.

135
00:09:38,407 --> 00:09:40,407

what to say right now.

Hey!

145
00:11:02,263 --> 00:11:03,930
You wanna take it out?

146
00:11:11,566 --> 00:11:12,665
What do you want?

147
00:11:13,661 --> 00:11:14,993
Whoever you are.

148
00:11:21,718 --> 00:11:23,050
Please.

149
00:11:25,367 --> 00:11:26,866
I never liked the name.

150
00:11:30,471 --> 00:11:31,804
It never felt like me.

151
00:11:33,541 --> 00:11:35,789
And when I figured out
who I was..

152
00:11:36,096 --> 00:11:37,796
That I was gay..

153
00:11:41,896 --> 00:11:43,406
...I changed it.

154
00:11:45,244 --> 00:11:47,244
I should've mentioned it
to you before.

155
00:11:48,685 --> 00:11:50,374
I'm sorry, Jules.

156
00:11:50,994 --> 00:11:52,994
That's not who I am anymore.

157
00:12:02,659 --> 00:12:03,991
Close your eyes.

158
00:12:05,851 --> 00:12:07,016
Please.

159
00:12:07,356 --> 00:12:08,588

Do you like it?

163
00:12:45,532 --> 00:12:47,532
God, you're so cheesy.

165
00:12:50,103 --> 00:12:51,703
I'm still pissed at you.

166
00:12:52,034 --> 00:12:53,172
I am.

167
00:12:56,777 --> 00:12:58,209

168
00:13:05,986 --> 00:13:07,252

169
00:13:08,907 --> 00:13:10,674
The scope isn't aligned alright.

170
00:13:12,492 --> 00:13:14,726
I still can't believe your dad
never took you hunting.

171
00:13:16,453 --> 00:13:18,730
Target practice
is enough for me.

172
00:13:18,819 --> 00:13:21,320
Killing for sport
isn't exactly my thing.

173
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:26,533
Killing for sport
is not what hunting is.

Trust me.

176
00:13:33,286 --> 00:13:34,685
Straighten your shoulders, babe.

177
00:13:35,382 --> 00:13:36,948
Your form is all wrong.

178
00:13:36,983 --> 00:13:38,983

179
00:13:44,803 --> 00:13:46,002
Holy shit!

180
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:48,493
I know.

181
00:13:50,288 --> 00:13:53,689
My dad, he used to hunt
every summer up here.

182
00:13:55,769 --> 00:13:57,101
One summer..

183
00:13:58,805 --> 00:14:00,939
...he wakes me
and my friend Jenny up

184
00:14:00,974 --> 00:14:03,441
at the crack of dawn,
and he says to us

185
00:14:04,878 --> 00:14:07,445
"It's time you girls learn
a bit about life."

00:14:09,454 --> 00:14:10,454
So...

188
00:14:10,917 --> 00:14:14,719
...he hands each of us a rifle

189
00:14:14,930 --> 00:14:16,422
and off we go.

190
00:14:17,157 --> 00:14:21,193
We're crying
and complaining and..

191
00:14:21,533 --> 00:14:25,414
And he's giving us hell
for being such girls.

192
00:14:25,665 --> 00:14:26,965
Sounds like it.

193
00:14:27,078 --> 00:14:29,211
chuckles

194
00:14:29,369 --> 00:14:31,970
And eventually I go
wondering off on my own

195
00:14:33,106 --> 00:14:34,639
but I get turned around.

196
00:14:36,810 --> 00:14:38,510
The next thing I know..

197
00:14:38,545 --> 00:14:40,512
I find myself face to face

198
00:14:40,547 --> 00:14:43,982
with this massive black bear.

199
00:14:46,445 --> 00:14:47,853
It's just standing there.

200
00:14:48,133 --> 00:14:49,863
Not more than 20 feet
away from me

201
00:14:49,899 --> 00:14:52,047
and it's looking right at me.

202
00:14:52,938 --> 00:14:54,898
So I line her up in my sights..

203
00:14:55,453 --> 00:14:57,286
Boom! Down she goes.

204
00:14:58,465 --> 00:15:00,031
I race up to it thinking

205
00:15:00,567 --> 00:15:03,234
how proud he's gonna be,
it's my first kill.

206
00:15:07,577 --> 00:15:09,376
But she's still breathing.

207
00:15:11,378 --> 00:15:13,177
She's struggling.

208
00:15:16,126 --> 00:15:19,805
Trying to stand up
and... screaming out.

209
00:15:25,581 --> 00:15:27,147
What did you do?

210
00:15:28,904 --> 00:15:31,471
I lined my gun up
to do the humane thing.

211
00:15:34,432 --> 00:15:35,931
But it jammed.

212
00:15:37,136 --> 00:15:40,671
So I just... stood over it..

213
00:15:42,270 --> 00:15:44,270
...the next 20 minutes and I..

214
00:15:45,595 --> 00:15:49,330
I watched the life
slowly fade from her eyes.

215
00:15:51,751 --> 00:15:53,251
I'll never forget it.

216
00:16:01,225 --> 00:16:03,274
My dad gave this to me
afterwards.

217
00:16:12,092 --> 00:16:14,459
Just in case my gun ever
jammed again.

218
00:16:18,031 --> 00:16:20,023
He used to say to me..

219
00:16:20,447 --> 00:16:24,048
"You only kill
what keeps you alive."

220
00:16:28,118 --> 00:16:29,961
What does that mean?

221
00:16:30,367 --> 00:16:33,058
It means we ate
every single square inch of meat

222
00:16:33,093 --> 00:16:35,093
off that bear over
the next month.

223
00:16:37,307 --> 00:16:39,107
Nothing went to waste.

224
00:16:46,632 --> 00:16:49,033
That's a pretty fucked up story.

225
00:16:49,185 --> 00:16:51,118
Jackie laughs
Yeah, I know.

226
00:16:51,945 --> 00:16:54,913
insects chirping

227
00:16:54,948 --> 00:16:57,949
intense music

228
00:17:00,820 --> 00:17:02,820
birds chirping

229
00:17:14,931 --> 00:17:16,998
Hey, babe!
I couldn't find a pen

230
00:17:17,109 --> 00:17:18,503
so I'm leaving a voice mail.

231
00:17:18,538 --> 00:17:21,006
I know, it's so '90s, right?

232
00:17:21,041 --> 00:17:24,175
Listen, I'm heading into town
for a bit to grab a few things

233
00:17:24,210 --> 00:17:25,977
but, uh, I'll be back
in the afternoon.

234
00:17:26,012 --> 00:17:31,282
P.S. You looked really cute
sleeping this morning. I love..

235
00:17:31,317 --> 00:17:32,717
sighs

236
00:17:50,503 --> 00:17:53,504
instrumental music

237
00:18:34,214 --> 00:18:37,215
panting

238
00:18:39,885 --> 00:18:42,186
Julie! Is that you?

239
00:18:44,452 --> 00:18:46,553
gasping Hope you don't
mind me popping by.

240
00:18:46,603 --> 00:18:48,970
Oh, God, no, of course not.
Just a second.

241
00:18:49,996 --> 00:18:52,597
breathing heavily

242
00:18:52,756 --> 00:18:55,123
Let me get you some water.
Just make yourself at home.

243
00:18:55,198 --> 00:18:57,232
Daniel, we have company.

244
00:19:01,407 --> 00:19:03,407
cutlery clanking

245
00:19:07,947 --> 00:19:09,480
water running

246
00:19:23,863 --> 00:19:25,863
instrumental music

247
00:19:30,236 --> 00:19:31,669
exhales

248
00:19:34,748 --> 00:19:37,594
- Uh, here.
- Oh, thanks.

249
00:19:38,011 --> 00:19:41,079
I -- is this you and Megan?

250
00:19:41,481 --> 00:19:43,014
Yeah, and Jenny.

251
00:19:44,296 --> 00:19:46,312
Ah, you guys are so young.

252
00:19:46,829 --> 00:19:49,564
Does Jenny still have a cottage
around here too?

253
00:19:49,727 --> 00:19:52,190
No. No, Jenny passed away.

254
00:19:53,591 --> 00:19:55,680
Oh, I'm sorry.

255
00:19:56,141 --> 00:20:00,744
Uh, just about two weeks after
that photo was taken actually.

256
00:20:02,567 --> 00:20:03,667
Jesus.

257
00:20:03,703 --> 00:20:06,337
Quite the endurance test,
isn't it?

258
00:20:06,372 --> 00:20:08,859
Yeah, it's deceiving,
that's for sure.

259
00:20:08,895 --> 00:20:09,896
scoffs

260
00:20:09,932 --> 00:20:10,932
Yeah.

261
00:20:11,678 --> 00:20:13,524
I'll be right down. Sorry.

262
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:15,613
Okay.

263
00:20:23,890 --> 00:20:25,223
- Julie, right?
- Yeah.

264
00:20:25,258 --> 00:20:26,691
- Daniel.
- Hi, nice to meet you.

265
00:20:26,757 --> 00:20:28,224
Nice to meet you.

266
00:20:28,531 --> 00:20:31,262
- Red or white?
- Water is good. Thank you.

267
00:20:31,297 --> 00:20:33,097
Sorry, I just want
to straighten this up

268
00:20:33,132 --> 00:20:36,500
but did, did Megan not tell you
anything about Jenny?

269
00:20:37,837 --> 00:20:41,505
Uh... no. Never.

270
00:20:43,343 --> 00:20:44,842
Why? What is it?

271
00:20:46,303 --> 00:20:47,437
Well..

272
00:20:48,805 --> 00:20:51,482
I guess it's a little bit
strange, don't you think?

273
00:20:51,517 --> 00:20:53,884
I mean, that was
a really big deal for us.

274
00:20:58,214 --> 00:21:02,249
Okay. Well, I'm gonna get
another glass of wine.

275
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:08,852
chuckles

276
00:21:09,469 --> 00:21:12,870
So, are, are you guys up here
very long, or just the weekend?

277
00:21:12,905 --> 00:21:14,772
Uh, yeah, just,
just for the weekend.

278
00:21:14,807 --> 00:21:17,234
It's our, uh...
one year anniversary.

279
00:21:17,977 --> 00:21:20,211
- Oh, congratulations.
- Yeah, thanks.

280
00:21:22,548 --> 00:21:25,549
instrumental music

281
00:21:43,936 --> 00:21:45,936
panting

282
00:21:55,782 --> 00:21:57,515
Can you help me?

283
00:21:59,552 --> 00:22:01,585
Come here.

284
00:22:04,872 --> 00:22:06,238
Is everything okay?

285
00:22:07,090 --> 00:22:08,389
Yeah.

286
00:22:09,278 --> 00:22:11,124
You're not a good liar, Jules.

287
00:22:11,564 --> 00:22:14,865
You haven't said more
than a few words to me all day.

288
00:22:23,276 --> 00:22:25,042
Why didn't you tell me
about Jenny?

289
00:22:27,447 --> 00:22:29,447
Your childhood friend.

290
00:22:30,925 --> 00:22:34,861
Sarah, she made it sound like
you had something to do --

291
00:22:34,921 --> 00:22:36,352
Wait. Wait.

292
00:22:37,446 --> 00:22:40,447
- You saw Sarah?
- And her husband Daniel.

293
00:22:41,061 --> 00:22:42,093
Yeah.

294
00:22:42,702 --> 00:22:44,168
Yesterday.

295
00:22:46,607 --> 00:22:48,173
Jesus!

296
00:22:50,436 --> 00:22:51,769
sighs

297
00:22:55,007 --> 00:22:57,007
exhales

298
00:23:07,535 --> 00:23:10,234
Sarah, Jenny and I..

299
00:23:13,367 --> 00:23:16,109
...we used to swim out
into the lake.

300
00:23:17,362 --> 00:23:19,796
We would try to race across
to the other side.

301
00:23:20,063 --> 00:23:23,789
chuckles
We were just stupid and young.

302
00:23:24,416 --> 00:23:26,716
One summer, Jenny challenged me.

303
00:23:28,550 --> 00:23:30,774
I was about half way across..

304
00:23:34,999 --> 00:23:37,232
And I started cramping up,
so I..

305
00:23:38,136 --> 00:23:39,539
...I stopped.

306
00:23:41,535 --> 00:23:44,570
I looked around to see
where she was..

307
00:23:45,978 --> 00:23:49,212
...and I, I couldn't find her.

308
00:23:58,504 --> 00:24:00,504
sobbing

309
00:24:02,680 --> 00:24:06,368
The search and rescue pulled
her body out of the lake..

310
00:24:07,197 --> 00:24:08,897
...two days later.

311
00:24:10,593 --> 00:24:12,426
And the police questioned me.

312
00:24:13,565 --> 00:24:15,524
I was cleared of any wrongdoing.

313
00:24:22,297 --> 00:24:24,078
sighs

314
00:24:24,350 --> 00:24:27,125
I would never have done
anything to hurt Jenny.

315
00:24:28,234 --> 00:24:29,719
She was my...

316
00:24:30,885 --> 00:24:32,984
my best friend.

317
00:24:34,273 --> 00:24:35,606
instrumental music

318
00:24:35,891 --> 00:24:37,124
Hey.

319
00:24:38,187 --> 00:24:39,753
Hey.

320
00:24:48,463 --> 00:24:50,414
Do you really think that I..

321
00:24:51,133 --> 00:24:55,024
No, no, no. I don't know..

322
00:24:55,643 --> 00:24:57,242
I don't know what I thought.

323
00:24:59,978 --> 00:25:01,277
Come here.

324
00:25:05,905 --> 00:25:07,638
I guess I probably shouldn't
have invited them over

325
00:25:07,673 --> 00:25:09,414
for dinner on Sunday.

326
00:25:09,758 --> 00:25:11,695
laughs
No, you didn't.

327
00:25:11,743 --> 00:25:13,109
I did.

328
00:25:15,008 --> 00:25:17,114
Okay, you're cooking.

329
00:25:17,172 --> 00:25:18,772
- No way!
- Yeah.

330
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:22,400
grunts

331
00:25:27,751 --> 00:25:30,051
I used to be really good,
you know.

332
00:25:30,087 --> 00:25:32,087
Like I was the only girl
on my team.

333
00:25:51,828 --> 00:25:53,851
God, Jackie,
this view is just --

334
00:25:53,886 --> 00:25:55,186
- Ahh!
- Huh!

335
00:25:55,221 --> 00:25:56,820
Jules screaming

336
00:26:25,518 --> 00:26:28,519
intense music

337
00:27:00,052 --> 00:27:03,053
water gushing

338
00:27:09,729 --> 00:27:12,730
fire crackling

339
00:27:21,674 --> 00:27:23,374
She fell off a cliff.

340
00:27:23,409 --> 00:27:25,109
911, my wife,
she fell off a cliff.

341
00:27:25,144 --> 00:27:28,179
Oh, my God! Please help me.
Okay, okay, okay.

342
00:27:28,214 --> 00:27:29,180
clears throat

343
00:27:29,215 --> 00:27:31,749
breathing heavily

344
00:27:31,784 --> 00:27:33,884
sobbing
911?

345
00:27:33,919 --> 00:27:37,188
exhales
It's my wife, she..

346
00:27:37,338 --> 00:27:39,142
sobbing
She fell off a cliff..

347
00:27:39,191 --> 00:27:41,158
I don't know what happened,
she..

348
00:27:41,396 --> 00:27:43,396
Just wake up, babe. Please.

349
00:27:44,463 --> 00:27:46,464
Oh, my God,
she's not responding.

350
00:27:46,499 --> 00:27:47,798
She's not responding..

351
00:27:47,833 --> 00:27:48,899
groans

352
00:27:48,934 --> 00:27:50,868
She's not breathing..

353
00:27:50,903 --> 00:27:52,455
Oh, can you please save her?

354
00:27:52,505 --> 00:27:53,505
laughs

355
00:27:54,089 --> 00:27:55,595
Alright now.

356
00:28:08,888 --> 00:28:11,088
She fell off a..
She fell off a cliff.

357
00:28:11,123 --> 00:28:12,590
She.. Oh, my God.

358
00:28:12,625 --> 00:28:15,026
Oh, God,
I don't know what to do.

359
00:28:15,061 --> 00:28:17,261
What am I supposed to do?

360
00:28:17,296 --> 00:28:18,796
Baby, wake up.

361
00:28:20,266 --> 00:28:22,266
intense music

362
00:28:23,669 --> 00:28:25,338
What the..

363
00:28:55,668 --> 00:28:57,668
gasping

364
00:28:59,672 --> 00:29:01,939
intense music

365
00:29:02,942 --> 00:29:04,494
groans

366
00:29:14,220 --> 00:29:16,320
gasping

367
00:29:32,338 --> 00:29:33,338
panting

368
00:29:33,666 --> 00:29:35,166
Here we go..

369
00:29:38,778 --> 00:29:40,144
inhales sharply

370
00:29:41,180 --> 00:29:42,713
groans

371
00:29:47,419 --> 00:29:49,419
coughs

372
00:29:56,028 --> 00:29:57,594
indistinct

373
00:30:04,888 --> 00:30:06,521
Baby, where are you?

374
00:30:09,316 --> 00:30:10,715
Are you okay?

375
00:30:13,712 --> 00:30:16,713
intense music

376
00:30:19,652 --> 00:30:20,652
Ah!

377
00:30:22,454 --> 00:30:24,255
Let's go home.

378
00:30:24,290 --> 00:30:25,290
Baby!

379
00:30:26,266 --> 00:30:27,900
Where are you?

380
00:30:29,128 --> 00:30:30,594
I'm so sorry.

381
00:30:34,969 --> 00:30:36,668
I didn't mean to.

382
00:30:38,910 --> 00:30:40,243
Are you okay?

383
00:30:42,635 --> 00:30:45,202
Please just call out
if you can hear me, okay?

384
00:30:45,612 --> 00:30:46,644
Baby?

385
00:30:49,046 --> 00:30:50,612
Baby, talk to me.

386
00:30:51,851 --> 00:30:54,185
It was an accident I swear,
I don't know what happened..

387
00:30:54,220 --> 00:30:56,053
I'm just, I'm freaking out.

388
00:30:57,590 --> 00:30:58,989
I'm scared.

389
00:30:59,024 --> 00:31:00,090
whimpering

390
00:31:01,193 --> 00:31:02,193
exhales

391
00:31:03,395 --> 00:31:04,395
Fuck.

392
00:31:04,430 --> 00:31:07,431
intense music

393
00:31:14,804 --> 00:31:16,370
crying

394
00:31:19,645 --> 00:31:20,878
breathing heavily

395
00:31:20,983 --> 00:31:21,984
Baby,

396
00:31:22,988 --> 00:31:25,002
please just talk to me!

397
00:31:26,362 --> 00:31:28,329
I love you so much.

398
00:31:29,509 --> 00:31:30,813
I'm scared.

399
00:31:31,046 --> 00:31:32,245
Please.

400
00:31:49,920 --> 00:31:52,921
sobbing

401
00:32:00,119 --> 00:32:02,185
Baby, please.

402
00:32:03,055 --> 00:32:05,055
breathing heavily

403
00:32:07,293 --> 00:32:09,526
Call out to me
if you can hear me, okay?

404
00:32:18,137 --> 00:32:19,536
Hey, come on.

405
00:32:28,681 --> 00:32:30,047
Jules, please.

406
00:32:33,085 --> 00:32:35,752
I'm so fucking scared.

407
00:32:38,290 --> 00:32:40,324
Jules, are you okay?

408
00:32:44,563 --> 00:32:46,363
Let me take you home.

409
00:32:47,566 --> 00:32:50,567
instrumental music

410
00:32:55,040 --> 00:32:56,040
Jules!

411
00:32:56,787 --> 00:32:58,654
Where are you?

412
00:32:59,926 --> 00:33:01,826
I'm done playing around.

413
00:33:03,583 --> 00:33:05,845
You must be confused.

414
00:33:06,276 --> 00:33:08,843
I mean, why would your wife
do this to you, right?

415
00:33:11,126 --> 00:33:12,736
You're probably thinking..

416
00:33:12,891 --> 00:33:13,924
chuckles

417
00:33:15,752 --> 00:33:18,392
"Maybe she's had
a psychotic break."

418
00:33:19,131 --> 00:33:21,131
instrumental music

419
00:33:22,887 --> 00:33:24,188
After all...

420
00:33:25,395 --> 00:33:27,056
we're in love, right?

421
00:33:39,544 --> 00:33:41,377
I know these woods..

422
00:33:42,592 --> 00:33:44,959
...like the back
of my hand, Jules.

423
00:33:48,605 --> 00:33:50,238
I'll find you.

424
00:33:52,664 --> 00:33:54,097
It's only a matter of time.

425
00:33:55,534 --> 00:33:57,467
thunder rumbling

426
00:34:03,409 --> 00:34:04,775
thunder rumbling

427
00:34:04,810 --> 00:34:07,778
Oh, shit!

428
00:34:09,982 --> 00:34:11,014
sighs

429
00:34:20,459 --> 00:34:23,460
heavy breathing

430
00:34:33,806 --> 00:34:35,739
- Caw! Caw!
- Ha-ha-ha!

431
00:34:35,774 --> 00:34:37,841
You're so weird.

432
00:34:37,876 --> 00:34:40,210
- Caw!
- What is that?

433
00:34:40,245 --> 00:34:41,879
- What is that?
- Guess.

434
00:34:41,914 --> 00:34:44,515
- Obviously a rooster.
- No!

435
00:34:44,550 --> 00:34:46,050
laughing

436
00:34:46,085 --> 00:34:47,718
Caw! Caw!

437
00:34:47,753 --> 00:34:50,454
- Mm, mm, mm, mm.
- Caw! Caw!

438
00:34:50,489 --> 00:34:53,357
- Oh, I know. I know what it is.
- Yeah?

439
00:34:53,392 --> 00:34:55,359
- A seagull.
- Oh!

440
00:34:55,394 --> 00:34:59,696
Caw! I'm a crow.
How did you not know that?

441
00:35:02,868 --> 00:35:07,604
Crow is the... smartest bird
in the wild.

442
00:35:09,374 --> 00:35:11,108
inhales sharply

443
00:35:13,045 --> 00:35:16,113
laughing

444
00:35:18,784 --> 00:35:20,951
Well, I'm..

445
00:35:21,887 --> 00:35:23,787
...a bald eagle.

446
00:35:25,557 --> 00:35:27,457
Are you scared?

447
00:35:29,595 --> 00:35:31,394
Just a little bit.

448
00:35:32,397 --> 00:35:35,398
crickets chirping

449
00:35:45,644 --> 00:35:48,645
dramatic music

450
00:36:21,647 --> 00:36:24,648

gasping

454
00:36:51,977 --> 00:36:53,744
Don't go to sleep, Jules.

455
00:36:53,779 --> 00:36:55,545
thinking
Fight it. Fight it.

456
00:36:57,649 --> 00:36:58,982
Fight it.

457
00:36:59,017 --> 00:37:02,018

breathing heavily

464
00:37:46,598 --> 00:37:48,331
Find the road.

465
00:37:49,201 --> 00:37:50,667
Find the road.

466
00:37:50,702 --> 00:37:52,702
breathing heavily

467
00:37:54,172 --> 00:37:56,172

Okay. Phone. Phone.

477
00:39:28,066 --> 00:39:29,466
Phone, phone, phone, phone.

478
00:39:29,501 --> 00:39:30,901
Where's the phone?

479
00:39:30,936 --> 00:39:32,002

Oh, God!

My phone.

489
00:40:00,999 --> 00:40:02,165
Bitch!

Bruised spleen.

It's not ruptured.
It's not ruptured.

498
00:40:50,849 --> 00:40:51,881

Oh, no. Okay, now.

I just wanna talk to you, Jules.

526
00:43:44,356 --> 00:43:46,456

Nice try!

547
00:45:05,670 --> 00:45:08,838
Don't you even dare, Jules.

548
00:45:08,873 --> 00:45:10,873
whimpering

549
00:45:13,078 --> 00:45:14,277
We'll work this out.

550
00:45:15,246 --> 00:45:16,512
I promise.

551
00:45:23,321 --> 00:45:24,754
Now, don't move.

552
00:45:27,559 --> 00:45:30,160

Why are you doing this?

553
00:45:30,195 --> 00:45:32,495
What, what the hell
is wrong with you?

554
00:45:32,530 --> 00:45:35,031
We're not doing this
right now, Jules.

555
00:45:38,403 --> 00:45:39,969
What the hell is wrong with you?

556
00:45:40,004 --> 00:45:43,106
We're not doing
this right now, Jules!

557

Everything okay, ladies?

00:45:52,350 --> 00:45:53,649
You alright?

559
00:45:55,553 --> 00:45:56,653
If you say even one word

560
00:45:56,688 --> 00:45:58,688

this won't end well.

You must be Daniel!

564
00:46:07,732 --> 00:46:09,966
I've heard good things!

565
00:46:10,001 --> 00:46:11,501
We're okay!

566
00:46:11,536 --> 00:46:13,403
Jules just got a bit cramped up

567
00:46:13,438 --> 00:46:17,540
so we're gonna, we're gonna
turn this boat back to shore!

568
00:46:17,575 --> 00:46:20,243
Wow, trying to make the trip
again, huh, Jules?

569
00:46:20,278 --> 00:46:22,312
It's impressive!

570
00:46:22,347 --> 00:46:24,814
Alright, well, we'll see you
tomorrow night then!

571
00:46:24,849 --> 00:46:27,350
A -- actually you know what?

572
00:46:27,385 --> 00:46:29,319
Tomorrow is not looking
so good for us.

573
00:46:29,354 --> 00:46:30,586
Tonight is!

574
00:46:31,589 --> 00:46:33,456
Uh, yeah.

575
00:46:33,491 --> 00:46:35,325
Okay, th -- that works better
actually.

576
00:46:35,360 --> 00:46:37,727
Uh, 8:00 p.m.

577
00:46:42,167 --> 00:46:44,100
Yeah, that's great!

578
00:46:46,838 --> 00:46:50,139
Okay, well,
uh, we'll see you then!

579
00:46:54,479 --> 00:46:56,345
What the fuck did I just say?

580
00:46:57,482 --> 00:46:58,681
You..

581
00:47:03,488 --> 00:47:05,822
There is only one way
this works.

582
00:47:05,857 --> 00:47:07,423
You fall

583
00:47:07,458 --> 00:47:08,925
you die

584
00:47:10,094 --> 00:47:11,394
I'm in pain.

585
00:47:11,429 --> 00:47:13,997
Jules sobbing

586
00:47:14,032 --> 00:47:15,698
But of course

587
00:47:15,733 --> 00:47:17,900
it has to look like an accident.

588
00:47:18,570 --> 00:47:20,103
Jules whimpering

589
00:47:20,138 --> 00:47:21,304
How much?

590
00:47:22,440 --> 00:47:24,607
Well, you should know that,
Jules.

591
00:47:24,642 --> 00:47:26,709
You're the one
that signed the policy.

592
00:47:38,389 --> 00:47:40,389
Did you ever love me?

593
00:47:42,360 --> 00:47:43,360
No.

594
00:47:47,332 --> 00:47:48,798
I saw right through you
from the second

595
00:47:48,833 --> 00:47:50,633
I laid my eyes on you.

596
00:47:50,668 --> 00:47:53,203
You're not gonna get away
with this.

597
00:47:53,238 --> 00:47:55,104
As soon as they get here

598
00:47:55,139 --> 00:47:58,641
I am going to scream
so goddamn loud.

599
00:47:58,676 --> 00:48:01,511
- No, you're not.
- Yes, I am.

600
00:48:01,546 --> 00:48:04,147
I'm gonna tell them exactly..

601
00:48:04,182 --> 00:48:06,182
muffled scream

602
00:48:18,463 --> 00:48:20,463
coughing

603
00:48:21,699 --> 00:48:23,766
sighs

604
00:48:23,801 --> 00:48:26,736
Jules? Jules?

605
00:48:26,771 --> 00:48:29,272
Jules, if you give
even the slightest indication

606
00:48:29,307 --> 00:48:31,641
that something is wrong

607
00:48:31,676 --> 00:48:33,676
I'm gonna take this knife
and I'm gonna stick it

608
00:48:33,711 --> 00:48:35,311
right into Sarah's chest.

609
00:48:35,346 --> 00:48:36,813
Right here.

610
00:48:36,848 --> 00:48:40,116
Right into her solar plexus

611
00:48:40,151 --> 00:48:44,287
and drag it all the way down
to her stomach

612
00:48:44,322 --> 00:48:46,022
before ripping it out

613
00:48:46,057 --> 00:48:48,624
along with everything else
that comes with it.

614
00:48:51,162 --> 00:48:52,728
Do you understand?

615
00:49:09,514 --> 00:49:11,514
fire crackling

616
00:49:22,126 --> 00:49:23,926
Your story..

617
00:49:26,464 --> 00:49:27,997
What your dad said..

618
00:49:31,402 --> 00:49:34,136
To only kill..

619
00:49:35,239 --> 00:49:37,239
...what keeps you alive.

620
00:49:41,412 --> 00:49:43,279
This isn't what he meant.

621
00:49:48,886 --> 00:49:51,587
You're sick, Jackie.

622
00:49:54,392 --> 00:49:56,492
But I can get you help.

623
00:49:59,630 --> 00:50:02,631
breathing heavily

624
00:50:21,919 --> 00:50:23,486
It's okay.

625
00:50:27,125 --> 00:50:29,726
It's not easy to admit.

626
00:50:29,761 --> 00:50:31,761
I understand.

627
00:50:37,602 --> 00:50:39,769
But I'll stay by your side.

628
00:50:42,407 --> 00:50:44,107
I will.

629
00:50:44,142 --> 00:50:46,042
Please, Jackie.

630
00:50:47,612 --> 00:50:49,445
I'll let it go.

631
00:50:50,581 --> 00:50:52,314
All of it.

632
00:50:54,318 --> 00:50:56,185
We can just get in the car
and drive

633
00:50:56,220 --> 00:50:58,821
and get as far away
from this place as possible..

634
00:50:59,524 --> 00:51:01,390
...before they show up.

635
00:51:02,126 --> 00:51:03,325
Please.

636
00:51:06,230 --> 00:51:09,331
I never told you
about my first wife, did I?

637
00:51:11,402 --> 00:51:12,601
Erica.

638
00:51:14,839 --> 00:51:17,106
We got married
when I was only 19.

639
00:51:18,443 --> 00:51:20,910
I guess it slipped my mind
until now.

640
00:51:23,748 --> 00:51:26,749
dramatic music

641
00:51:37,662 --> 00:51:39,028
groaning

642
00:51:47,004 --> 00:51:48,304
How?

643
00:51:51,509 --> 00:51:53,642
We were on vacation.

644
00:51:55,179 --> 00:51:56,579
She went swimming

645
00:51:56,614 --> 00:51:58,848
after having a few too many.

646
00:52:00,051 --> 00:52:01,617
I mourned her.

647
00:52:03,354 --> 00:52:04,954
Prayed with her parents.

648
00:52:05,623 --> 00:52:07,256
Read at her funeral.

649
00:52:10,828 --> 00:52:12,661
I'll do the same at yours.

650
00:52:17,135 --> 00:52:19,235
I know what you're trying to do,
Jules.

651
00:52:20,538 --> 00:52:23,038
And this little game
that you're playing right now..

652
00:52:24,876 --> 00:52:26,175
...won't work.

653
00:52:28,980 --> 00:52:31,347
How much was she worth?

654
00:52:32,783 --> 00:52:35,784
inhales

655
00:52:36,888 --> 00:52:38,721
She was priceless.

656
00:52:43,861 --> 00:52:46,696
I never thought I would be
having dinner with Megan again.

657
00:52:46,731 --> 00:52:47,964
Just breathe, baby

658
00:52:47,999 --> 00:52:49,665
and just be nice.

659
00:52:49,700 --> 00:52:51,200
It'll be over
before you know it.

660
00:52:51,235 --> 00:52:52,602
Yeah, that's easy
for you to say.

661
00:52:52,637 --> 00:52:53,702
Um..

662
00:52:54,572 --> 00:52:56,205
- Hi!
- Hey!

663
00:52:56,240 --> 00:52:57,707
So glad you guys could make it!

664
00:52:57,742 --> 00:52:59,142
- Yeah! Thank you!
- Come in, come in.

665
00:52:59,177 --> 00:53:01,043
Don't worry about your shoes,
just make yourself at home.

666
00:53:01,078 --> 00:53:04,080
Wow! Megan,
it is crazy to be back here.

667
00:53:04,115 --> 00:53:05,314
- It's like a time capsule.
- Yeah.

668
00:53:05,349 --> 00:53:06,749
It's been a,
it's been a while for you.

669
00:53:06,784 --> 00:53:08,017
- That's for sure.
- Yeah.

670
00:53:08,052 --> 00:53:09,385
We brought a nice bottle
of wine.

671
00:53:09,420 --> 00:53:10,586
Oh, great!
Uh, yeah, follow me.

672
00:53:10,621 --> 00:53:11,654
The glasses
are in the kitchen here.

673
00:53:11,689 --> 00:53:13,556
Great! Open up
a nice bottle of wine.

674
00:53:13,591 --> 00:53:15,658
Yes, let's.

675
00:53:16,994 --> 00:53:18,828
- Thanks.
- Jules!

676
00:53:18,863 --> 00:53:20,696
Oh, it's so nice
to see you again.

677
00:53:24,035 --> 00:53:25,201
Are you okay?

678
00:53:25,236 --> 00:53:27,102
Yeah, I -- I'm fine.

679
00:53:28,539 --> 00:53:31,941
Did you, uh, strain yourself
with all the paddling, Jules?

680
00:53:34,278 --> 00:53:35,744
Yeah, that's it.

681
00:53:36,647 --> 00:53:38,181
Nothing, a few painkillers

682
00:53:38,216 --> 00:53:39,582
and a shot of whiskey
won't cure.

683
00:53:39,617 --> 00:53:41,117
Well, I hear that!

684
00:53:41,152 --> 00:53:43,653
Well, we, well,
we brought a bottle of wine

685
00:53:43,688 --> 00:53:45,488
would you like to come
have a glass?

686
00:53:45,523 --> 00:53:46,789
Love to.

687
00:53:52,697 --> 00:53:54,797
instrumental music

688
00:53:54,832 --> 00:53:56,732
exhales

689
00:53:56,767 --> 00:53:59,302
indistinct chatter

690
00:53:59,337 --> 00:54:02,204
So, Jules,
when did you know about Megan?

691
00:54:04,275 --> 00:54:06,575
Julie? Julie?

692
00:54:07,511 --> 00:54:09,679
Sorry, I -- I missed that.

693
00:54:09,714 --> 00:54:11,080
Just..

694
00:54:11,115 --> 00:54:13,115
I was asking when do you knew

695
00:54:13,150 --> 00:54:14,850
Megan was the one?

696
00:54:17,588 --> 00:54:19,788
Megan, uh..

697
00:54:21,025 --> 00:54:23,092
I don't know.

698
00:54:23,127 --> 00:54:25,728
Well, what I -- I think
she means to say

699
00:54:25,763 --> 00:54:27,162
is that..

700
00:54:27,999 --> 00:54:29,699
...it was love at first sight.

701
00:54:29,734 --> 00:54:31,000
chuckles

702
00:54:31,035 --> 00:54:32,801
Well, now that I want to hear.

703
00:54:34,705 --> 00:54:35,804
Uh..

704
00:54:37,308 --> 00:54:40,943
L -- love happened

705
00:54:40,978 --> 00:54:42,411
slowly for me.

706
00:54:43,914 --> 00:54:46,148
And then all at once.

707
00:54:46,183 --> 00:54:49,418
You start to notice
all the little things.

708
00:54:49,453 --> 00:54:51,220
The good..

709
00:54:51,255 --> 00:54:52,788
...and the bad.

710
00:54:53,924 --> 00:54:55,758
The way they blink a lot

711
00:54:55,793 --> 00:54:57,326
when they think hard.

712
00:54:58,763 --> 00:55:02,431
The way they laugh at jokes
that aren't funny.

713
00:55:02,466 --> 00:55:04,066
chuckles

714
00:55:04,101 --> 00:55:06,202
And all the little nuances

715
00:55:06,237 --> 00:55:08,804
that get under your skin.

716
00:55:08,839 --> 00:55:12,408
Like the way they,
uh, shower for too long

717
00:55:12,443 --> 00:55:15,577
or, or hog the blankets
at night, but..

718
00:55:17,014 --> 00:55:18,514
...but it's the way
they see the world

719
00:55:18,549 --> 00:55:21,083
differently than you that..

720
00:55:21,118 --> 00:55:22,885
...that really draws you in.

721
00:55:22,920 --> 00:55:24,787
See now that I get.

722
00:55:24,822 --> 00:55:26,656
And even though..

723
00:55:26,691 --> 00:55:28,624
...even though..

724
00:55:28,659 --> 00:55:30,025
...you can..

725
00:55:31,128 --> 00:55:32,261
...never really know

726
00:55:32,296 --> 00:55:34,296
what's going on
inside their head.

727
00:55:35,966 --> 00:55:37,232
I mean..

728
00:55:38,903 --> 00:55:41,303
...really know
what's going on inside.

729
00:55:43,441 --> 00:55:45,441
You take the leap anyway..

730
00:55:47,545 --> 00:55:48,777
...and..

731
00:55:50,114 --> 00:55:51,747
...you hope for the best.

732
00:55:56,387 --> 00:55:58,787
And you just pray
you don't get the worst.

733
00:56:07,932 --> 00:56:09,265
Of course..

734
00:56:09,300 --> 00:56:11,734
...with Megan,
I got really lucky.

735
00:56:12,303 --> 00:56:15,304
laughing

736
00:56:18,609 --> 00:56:19,642
That was good.

737
00:56:19,677 --> 00:56:21,077
laughing

738
00:56:21,112 --> 00:56:22,678
Well, if it's anything
like our marriage

739
00:56:22,713 --> 00:56:24,213
then I'm sure
she's the lucky one.

740
00:56:24,248 --> 00:56:26,349
Mm! Really,
I'm the lucky one?

741
00:56:26,384 --> 00:56:27,616
Oh!

742
00:56:27,651 --> 00:56:29,618
laughs

743
00:56:29,653 --> 00:56:32,654
instrumental music

744
00:56:34,859 --> 00:56:36,592
Yeah.

745
00:56:36,627 --> 00:56:37,993
She strained herself
quite a bit today

746
00:56:38,028 --> 00:56:39,929
she pushed herself too hard.

747
00:56:39,964 --> 00:56:41,497
She's always overdoing it.

748
00:56:41,532 --> 00:56:43,733
So stubborn.

749
00:56:43,768 --> 00:56:45,868
My wife, don't tell her
I said it.

750
00:56:45,903 --> 00:56:47,636
She actually, she's a funny one.

751
00:56:47,671 --> 00:56:51,907
She -- she actually has
these ideas about you.

752
00:56:51,942 --> 00:56:55,344
Uh, fantasies, really.

753
00:56:56,113 --> 00:56:57,246
laughing

754
00:56:57,281 --> 00:56:58,881
Oh, man. Mm.

755
00:56:59,984 --> 00:57:02,685
I don't, I shouldn't say.

756
00:57:02,720 --> 00:57:03,853
No, it's nothing, honestly.

757
00:57:03,888 --> 00:57:05,154
It's..

758
00:57:05,189 --> 00:57:07,656
She just has this like,
you know, idea that..

759
00:57:07,691 --> 00:57:09,125
You know, that you're like a..

760
00:57:09,160 --> 00:57:11,394
Just, you know,
little bit of a..

761
00:57:11,429 --> 00:57:13,929
- You know..
- A psychopath.

762
00:57:19,136 --> 00:57:20,936
laughing

763
00:57:20,971 --> 00:57:23,105
I drank too much wine,
don't do that.

764
00:57:23,140 --> 00:57:24,707
That was good.

765
00:57:24,742 --> 00:57:26,108
You got me.

766
00:57:26,143 --> 00:57:27,543
Ooh, that was funny.

767
00:57:27,578 --> 00:57:28,911
Sorry, I shouldn't have
told you that

768
00:57:28,946 --> 00:57:29,979
but, yeah, she thinks
you're a psychopath, yeah.

769
00:57:30,014 --> 00:57:32,347
Mm, will you excuse me
for one second?

770
00:57:36,420 --> 00:57:39,155
dramatic music

771
00:57:39,190 --> 00:57:41,089
no audio

772
00:58:01,745 --> 00:58:02,778
Daniel!

773
00:58:02,813 --> 00:58:05,047
Daniel, get away from her!

774
00:58:05,082 --> 00:58:06,582
What? What is it?

775
00:58:08,419 --> 00:58:10,319
I can't hear you!

776
00:58:11,689 --> 00:58:14,690
dramatic music

777
00:58:26,036 --> 00:58:28,304
Run!

778
00:58:28,339 --> 00:58:30,439
No! No!

779
00:58:30,474 --> 00:58:32,341
Oh, my God! No, please!

780
00:58:32,376 --> 00:58:33,542
Please, don't!

781
00:58:33,577 --> 00:58:34,543
Oh, my God!

782
00:58:34,578 --> 00:58:35,811
screams

783
00:58:37,414 --> 00:58:40,616
grunts
No! Please! Please!

784
00:58:40,651 --> 00:58:43,419
Please, Megan, no!

785
00:58:43,454 --> 00:58:45,153
Please!

786
00:58:46,056 --> 00:58:47,590
Please, no!

787
00:58:47,625 --> 00:58:50,626
both grunting

788
00:58:52,263 --> 00:58:53,596
Jenny fought harder.

789
00:58:53,631 --> 00:58:56,632
grunting

790
00:59:08,045 --> 00:59:10,045
panting

791
00:59:27,898 --> 00:59:29,565
Give me your hand.

792
00:59:29,600 --> 00:59:31,066
Feel that?

793
00:59:31,101 --> 00:59:32,434
Your heart.

794
00:59:33,370 --> 00:59:34,570
Racing.

795
00:59:39,443 --> 00:59:40,776
What do you feel?

796
00:59:45,015 --> 00:59:46,749
It's..

797
00:59:46,784 --> 00:59:48,183
...it's steady.

798
00:59:49,687 --> 00:59:51,220
Exactly.

799
00:59:51,255 --> 00:59:54,256
dramatic music

800
01:00:16,146 --> 01:00:18,213
How deep do you think
the lake is?

801
01:00:18,248 --> 01:00:19,248
grunts

802
01:00:22,019 --> 01:00:23,619
Oh, I know.

803
01:00:23,654 --> 01:00:25,854
Because I..

804
01:00:25,889 --> 01:00:27,056
grunts

805
01:00:27,091 --> 01:00:28,924
...looked it up.

806
01:00:28,959 --> 01:00:31,093
And I was..

807
01:00:31,128 --> 01:00:32,394
...debating..

808
01:00:33,230 --> 01:00:35,698
...on whether or not I should

809
01:00:35,733 --> 01:00:37,232
drown you in it..

810
01:00:39,069 --> 01:00:41,069
...or toss you off the cliff.

811
01:00:45,809 --> 01:00:47,910
It's 350 feet

812
01:00:47,945 --> 01:00:49,945
at its deepest point.

813
01:00:50,681 --> 01:00:52,447
This is on you, Jules.

814
01:00:55,219 --> 01:00:56,518
retches

815
01:00:56,553 --> 01:00:58,520
Keep it down.

816
01:00:58,555 --> 01:01:01,356
It's not gonna get any easier
when I make you do the next one.

817
01:01:04,561 --> 01:01:05,694
whimpers

818
01:01:05,729 --> 01:01:07,963
Oh, my God!

819
01:01:11,001 --> 01:01:12,901
gasps

820
01:01:23,013 --> 01:01:25,013
grunting

821
01:01:33,424 --> 01:01:36,425
dramatic music

822
01:01:37,995 --> 01:01:39,728
Here we go.

823
01:01:40,631 --> 01:01:43,632
music continues

824
01:02:09,727 --> 01:02:11,727
You didn't have to kill them.

825
01:02:13,831 --> 01:02:15,363
I didn't kill them.

826
01:02:17,334 --> 01:02:18,366
You did.

827
01:02:19,970 --> 01:02:22,003
You were looking
for an easy way out.

828
01:02:22,973 --> 01:02:24,606
And there isn't one.

829
01:02:27,177 --> 01:02:29,311
How many times
do I have to tell you, Jules?

830
01:02:29,346 --> 01:02:31,546
Blot, don't scrub!

831
01:02:32,616 --> 01:02:34,516
Scrubbing will embed the stain

832
01:02:34,551 --> 01:02:37,552
and forensics
will spot it right away.

833
01:03:03,447 --> 01:03:06,114
How come you never mentioned
your dad until this trip?

834
01:03:12,289 --> 01:03:14,456
You would always
just change the subject.

835
01:03:17,127 --> 01:03:18,727
Did he do something to you?

836
01:03:19,329 --> 01:03:20,929
Or your mom?

837
01:03:21,899 --> 01:03:23,799
chuckles
No.

838
01:03:24,368 --> 01:03:25,534
He didn't.

839
01:03:26,637 --> 01:03:28,336
They were happy.

840
01:03:33,377 --> 01:03:34,843
Then what?

841
01:03:38,816 --> 01:03:40,982
What turned you
into this monster?

842
01:03:52,329 --> 01:03:53,862
It's nature..

843
01:03:55,232 --> 01:03:56,865
...not nurture.

844
01:04:10,781 --> 01:04:12,614
I'm free in all the ways
you're not.

845
01:04:12,649 --> 01:04:15,650
piano music

846
01:04:19,857 --> 01:04:22,190
You're trapped by emotions.

847
01:04:25,529 --> 01:04:27,362
Weighed down by guilt.

848
01:04:30,801 --> 01:04:33,401
Your conscience
isn't a source of strength.

849
01:04:38,208 --> 01:04:40,108
It's your Achilles heel.

850
01:04:42,045 --> 01:04:45,046
music continues

851
01:05:15,078 --> 01:05:18,146
music continues

852
01:05:48,178 --> 01:05:51,179
music continues

853
01:06:21,211 --> 01:06:24,212
music continues

854
01:07:04,021 --> 01:07:06,021
panting

855
01:07:09,926 --> 01:07:12,927
dramatic music

856
01:07:42,959 --> 01:07:45,960
music continues

857
01:08:00,710 --> 01:08:03,711
bed creaking

858
01:08:22,766 --> 01:08:25,767
intense music

859
01:08:35,812 --> 01:08:36,812
gasps

860
01:08:56,299 --> 01:08:57,299
Eat up.

861
01:08:58,068 --> 01:08:59,334
sighs

862
01:08:59,369 --> 01:09:00,969
I need you to have
a full stomach

863
01:09:01,004 --> 01:09:02,937
in case they do an autopsy.

864
01:09:10,147 --> 01:09:12,413
What are the pliers for?

865
01:09:16,486 --> 01:09:17,886
I can't have you
falling off the cliff

866
01:09:17,921 --> 01:09:20,722
with stitches
in your stomach, can I?

867
01:09:30,433 --> 01:09:32,433
whimpering

868
01:09:44,781 --> 01:09:46,614
Just one second.

869
01:09:48,552 --> 01:09:51,286
Just stay put.
It's almost over.

870
01:09:53,190 --> 01:09:55,190
humming

871
01:09:56,927 --> 01:09:57,959
door closes

872
01:09:59,796 --> 01:10:01,796
water running

873
01:10:03,967 --> 01:10:06,968
dramatic music

874
01:10:16,146 --> 01:10:19,147
Jackie humming

875
01:10:27,657 --> 01:10:30,658
intense music

876
01:11:08,598 --> 01:11:09,864
Oh, my God.

877
01:11:11,301 --> 01:11:12,367
clank

878
01:11:19,843 --> 01:11:22,844
engine revving

879
01:11:27,117 --> 01:11:28,783
Do you just enjoy this?

880
01:11:30,754 --> 01:11:33,021
This was never about money.

881
01:11:34,491 --> 01:11:37,325
Why not just go
skin a cat or something?

882
01:11:38,795 --> 01:11:40,962
Isn't that what people like you
do on your spare time?

883
01:11:44,801 --> 01:11:47,368
dramatic music

884
01:11:49,539 --> 01:11:51,773
I know what it is.

885
01:11:51,808 --> 01:11:55,076
You're just desperate.
Aren't you?

886
01:11:57,080 --> 01:12:01,316
To feel... something.

887
01:12:02,018 --> 01:12:03,451
Anything.

888
01:12:03,486 --> 01:12:04,852
Keep talking, Jules.

889
01:12:06,056 --> 01:12:08,456
Your words aren't gonna
slow the fall.

890
01:12:08,491 --> 01:12:09,891
Nothing is.

891
01:12:10,627 --> 01:12:11,893
chuckles

892
01:12:15,265 --> 01:12:18,266
music continues

893
01:12:19,469 --> 01:12:20,968
No, you're right.

894
01:12:22,972 --> 01:12:24,706
They're not going to.

895
01:12:27,077 --> 01:12:28,810
Jules grunts

896
01:12:28,845 --> 01:12:30,845
Jules panting

897
01:12:36,086 --> 01:12:37,185
Ugh!

898
01:12:39,989 --> 01:12:41,089
Oh, no.

899
01:12:44,594 --> 01:12:46,094
Come back here!

900
01:12:47,030 --> 01:12:49,030
panting

901
01:12:51,935 --> 01:12:53,368
No!

902
01:12:53,403 --> 01:12:56,404
panting

903
01:13:07,417 --> 01:13:10,418
intense music

904
01:13:14,457 --> 01:13:16,257
No!

905
01:13:17,627 --> 01:13:18,826
Jules!

906
01:13:20,163 --> 01:13:21,195
Stop!

907
01:13:31,374 --> 01:13:33,908
panting

908
01:13:34,778 --> 01:13:36,377
There's nowhere left to run.

909
01:13:44,454 --> 01:13:45,520
Fuck it.

910
01:13:46,089 --> 01:13:47,088
grunts

911
01:13:47,123 --> 01:13:48,423
I'm gonna kill..

912
01:14:16,586 --> 01:14:18,019
shuddering

913
01:14:32,702 --> 01:14:34,168
sobs

914
01:14:36,739 --> 01:14:37,872
sniffles

915
01:14:40,043 --> 01:14:41,375
exhales

916
01:14:43,446 --> 01:14:44,512
sniffles

917
01:15:18,314 --> 01:15:21,315
sobbing

918
01:15:22,819 --> 01:15:25,820
instrumental music

919
01:15:29,959 --> 01:15:31,559
crying

920
01:15:36,599 --> 01:15:39,600
crying continues

921
01:15:49,946 --> 01:15:52,947
screaming

922
01:16:07,730 --> 01:16:10,731
crow cawing

923
01:16:25,982 --> 01:16:28,115
crow cawing

924
01:16:28,718 --> 01:16:30,851
Caw! I'm a crow.

925
01:16:31,688 --> 01:16:33,888
Well, I am..

926
01:16:34,891 --> 01:16:36,624
...a bald eagle.

927
01:16:38,595 --> 01:16:40,227
Are you scared?

928
01:16:41,364 --> 01:16:44,365
dramatic music

929
01:17:06,589 --> 01:17:09,590
panting

930
01:17:28,044 --> 01:17:30,378
panting

931
01:17:38,121 --> 01:17:40,187
keys jingling

932
01:17:50,400 --> 01:17:51,899
Okay.

933
01:17:53,069 --> 01:17:56,070
panting

934
01:18:22,865 --> 01:18:24,065
Jackie!

935
01:18:36,479 --> 01:18:38,112
Jackie, where are you?

936
01:18:45,288 --> 01:18:47,121
Jackie, get out here!

937
01:18:49,092 --> 01:18:52,093
panting

938
01:19:03,039 --> 01:19:04,405
Jackie!

939
01:19:21,023 --> 01:19:24,024
crickets chirping

940
01:19:42,245 --> 01:19:43,277
grunts

941
01:19:47,617 --> 01:19:48,816
grunts

942
01:19:55,792 --> 01:19:56,857
sighs

943
01:19:58,027 --> 01:19:59,093
Mmm.

944
01:20:01,597 --> 01:20:04,598
panting

945
01:20:08,704 --> 01:20:11,705
Silverchair singing

gun cocks

971
01:22:22,705 --> 01:22:25,572
Lift your hands into the air
really fucking slowly.

972
01:22:26,909 --> 01:22:28,242
Slowly.

973
01:22:32,782 --> 01:22:35,049
Pretty brave, Jules.

974
01:22:36,519 --> 01:22:39,753
Stupid, but brave.

975
01:22:48,331 --> 01:22:50,431
Move to the middle of the room.

976
01:23:04,981 --> 01:23:06,647
Get on your knees.

977
01:23:11,587 --> 01:23:15,222
I'm not fucking around, Jackie!

978
01:23:15,257 --> 01:23:17,191
Get on your knees!

979
01:23:31,140 --> 01:23:33,107
Hands on your head.

grunts

981
01:23:40,583 --> 01:23:42,216

deep breathing

983
01:23:51,627 --> 01:23:53,327
All those people..

984
01:23:56,365 --> 01:23:58,232
...they trusted you.

985
01:24:02,271 --> 01:24:03,971
I trusted you.

986
01:24:07,977 --> 01:24:11,078
You are never going to
do this again.

987
01:24:15,017 --> 01:24:18,052
I'm not going to let you
do it again.

988
01:24:18,087 --> 01:24:20,487
If you pull that trigger,
Jules..

989
01:24:23,959 --> 01:24:27,294
...you're more likely to kill
yourself than hurt me.

990
01:24:31,467 --> 01:24:33,200
What are you talking about?

991
01:24:35,137 --> 01:24:36,737
It's an antique.

992
01:24:39,341 --> 01:24:42,676
Bullet trap hole is gonna
rip your face apart.

993
01:24:46,182 --> 01:24:48,582
Hasn't been fired in 50 years.

994
01:24:53,289 --> 01:24:54,688
You're lying.

995
01:24:56,392 --> 01:24:57,724
I'm not.

996
01:24:59,862 --> 01:25:02,863
dramatic music

997
01:25:22,051 --> 01:25:23,851
Put the gun down, Jules.

998
01:25:24,920 --> 01:25:26,453
You're not a killer.

999
01:25:34,029 --> 01:25:34,995
gunfire

1000
01:25:35,030 --> 01:25:37,030

grunting

1016
01:27:14,363 --> 01:27:15,696
Come here!

1017
01:27:16,632 --> 01:27:19,700
grunting

1018
01:27:22,171 --> 01:27:23,303
No!

1019
01:27:24,540 --> 01:27:25,540
Die!

1020
01:27:36,418 --> 01:27:38,986
footsteps

1021
01:27:43,692 --> 01:27:46,693
breathing heavily

1022
01:28:09,351 --> 01:28:10,751
Jackie grunts

1023
01:28:15,791 --> 01:28:18,458
panting

1024
01:28:19,628 --> 01:28:22,629
grunting

1025
01:28:36,845 --> 01:28:38,178
panting

1026
01:28:45,788 --> 01:28:46,920
No, please, Jackie!

1027
01:28:46,955 --> 01:28:48,221
No, don't!

1028
01:28:48,757 --> 01:28:49,757
thud

1029
01:28:54,897 --> 01:28:56,063
grunts

1030
01:29:01,670 --> 01:29:04,671
heavy breathing

1031
01:29:11,280 --> 01:29:13,147
911. What's the nature
of your emergency?

1032
01:29:13,182 --> 01:29:14,581
sobbing
Oh, my God.

1033
01:29:14,616 --> 01:29:18,118
Oh, my God.
My wife, she fell.

1034
01:29:18,153 --> 01:29:21,188
Please wake up, baby,
wake up, I'm here.

1035
01:29:22,028 --> 01:29:23,494
No, she's not breathing.

1036
01:29:23,959 --> 01:29:26,193
She's not breathing.

1037
01:29:26,228 --> 01:29:28,095
sobbing

1038
01:29:28,130 --> 01:29:30,964
Please send help, she fell.

1039
01:29:30,999 --> 01:29:32,499
Um..

1040
01:29:32,534 --> 01:29:35,369
Um, it's, uh, Bearview Drive.

1041
01:29:36,638 --> 01:29:39,940
Oh, God, baby, wake up.

1042
01:29:39,975 --> 01:29:42,710
It's -- it's 20 minutes
off the 101.

1043
01:29:42,745 --> 01:29:46,213
Um, wait, what? I -- I can't
hear you, I can't hear you.

1044
01:29:46,248 --> 01:29:47,481
I can't.. What did you say?

1045
01:29:47,516 --> 01:29:48,582
I can't..

1046
01:29:53,021 --> 01:29:54,021
grunts

1047
01:29:59,528 --> 01:30:02,529
groaning

1048
01:30:03,832 --> 01:30:06,833
retching

1049
01:30:12,107 --> 01:30:14,274
heavy breathing

1050
01:30:15,744 --> 01:30:17,043
Here, let me help.

1051
01:30:19,515 --> 01:30:23,851
I can still see straight,
like you.

1052
01:30:23,886 --> 01:30:25,218
Jackie chuckles

1053
01:30:29,591 --> 01:30:32,592
heavy breathing

1054
01:30:37,199 --> 01:30:38,732
sighs

1055
01:30:39,935 --> 01:30:41,268
water gurgling

1056
01:30:42,471 --> 01:30:43,804
Oh, God.

1057
01:30:48,844 --> 01:30:49,910
See?

1058
01:30:54,883 --> 01:30:56,116
Trust.

1059
01:30:57,820 --> 01:31:00,821
instrumental music

1060
01:31:03,392 --> 01:31:04,524
exhales

1061
01:31:08,497 --> 01:31:09,629
grunts

1062
01:31:13,469 --> 01:31:14,868
What?

1063
01:31:15,871 --> 01:31:16,937
Umm..

1064
01:31:18,474 --> 01:31:21,308
You need premixed rapid acting.

1065
01:31:23,111 --> 01:31:25,745
Why aren't you a doctor again?

1066
01:31:27,049 --> 01:31:29,483
Let's not have that
conversation again.

1067
01:31:29,518 --> 01:31:31,284
imitating bird calls

1068
01:31:32,855 --> 01:31:34,421
That's my chicken.

1069
01:31:34,456 --> 01:31:35,989
laughing

1070
01:31:37,059 --> 01:31:38,192
Caw!

1071
01:31:38,227 --> 01:31:39,326
sighs

1072
01:31:40,095 --> 01:31:41,561
intense music

1073
01:31:44,800 --> 01:31:45,932
What the..

1074
01:31:50,172 --> 01:31:51,404
Hey, Jackie.

1075
01:31:53,308 --> 01:31:55,542
I bet you weren't expecting
to find me here.

1076
01:31:58,347 --> 01:32:00,046
If you're watching this..

1077
01:32:02,184 --> 01:32:04,084
...then that must mean I'm dead.

1078
01:32:05,554 --> 01:32:07,721
But that's not what I'm here
to tell you.

1079
01:32:12,294 --> 01:32:14,728
I wonder how you're feeling
right about now.

1080
01:32:16,965 --> 01:32:20,600
Probably starting to notice
some symptoms.

1081
01:32:21,403 --> 01:32:23,904
You know, Jackie..

1082
01:32:23,939 --> 01:32:25,472
...you should really start
paying better attention

1083
01:32:25,507 --> 01:32:27,274
to what you put in your body.

1084
01:32:28,443 --> 01:32:33,113
You see, when hydrogen peroxide

1085
01:32:33,148 --> 01:32:35,382
is injected into
the blood stream

1086
01:32:35,417 --> 01:32:39,086
it creates blood clots that move

1087
01:32:39,121 --> 01:32:41,755
through the circulatory system.

1088
01:32:41,790 --> 01:32:44,224
And once those clots
reach the brain..

1089
01:32:47,029 --> 01:32:49,029
...guess what happens?

1090
01:32:50,966 --> 01:32:53,967
dramatic music

1091
01:32:55,070 --> 01:32:56,836
You have a stroke.

1092
01:32:58,106 --> 01:32:59,239
gasps

1093
01:33:02,778 --> 01:33:03,877
God, I really wish I could see

1094
01:33:03,912 --> 01:33:05,879
the look on your face right now.

1095
01:33:09,384 --> 01:33:11,818
I wonder how much
that would be worth.

1096
01:33:16,758 --> 01:33:19,826
intense music

1097
01:33:36,111 --> 01:33:37,611
Jackie screams

1098
01:33:37,646 --> 01:33:38,646
shatters

1099
01:33:44,953 --> 01:33:47,954
instrumental music

1100
01:34:25,060 --> 01:34:28,061
music continues

1101
01:35:08,870 --> 01:35:09,870
gunshot

1102
01:35:22,084 --> 01:35:23,817
groaning

1103
01:35:26,488 --> 01:35:28,621
gagging

1104
01:35:45,640 --> 01:35:48,641
gasping

1105
01:35:57,853 --> 01:36:00,854
birds chirping

1106
01:36:03,058 --> 01:36:06,059
water gurgling

1107
01:36:54,142 --> 01:36:55,142
