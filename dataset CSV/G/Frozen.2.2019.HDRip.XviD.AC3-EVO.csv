is trapped"
5,"00:01:03,238","00:01:04,805","in the snow goblin's
evil spell."
6,"00:01:04,807","00:01:07,607","Quick, Elsa! Make a prince!
A fancy one!"
7,"00:01:07,609","00:01:09,844","Oh, no! The prince
is trapped, too."
8,"00:01:09,846","00:01:11,679",Who cares about danger
9,"00:01:11,681","00:01:12,713",when there's love?
10,"00:01:12,715","00:01:14,647","Ugh, Anna. Bleugh!"
11,"00:01:14,649","00:01:16,449","Kissing won't save
the Forest."
12,"00:01:16,451","00:01:18,821",The lost fairies cry out.
13,"00:01:20,255","00:01:21,387","What sound
does a giraffe make?"
14,"00:01:21,389","00:01:22,489",Never mind.
15,"00:01:22,491","00:01:23,758","They wake

and saves everyone!"
17,"00:01:26,628","00:01:29,063",And they all get married!
18,"00:01:29,065","00:01:30,330",What are you playing?
19,"00:01:30,332","00:01:32,032",Enchanted Forest.
20,"00:01:32,034","00:01:33,566","The prince
and the princess..."
21,"00:01:33,568","00:01:35,770","Hmm. That's like no enchanted
forest I've ever seen."
22,"00:01:35,772","00:01:38,706","You've seen
an enchanted forest?"
23,"00:01:38,708","00:01:39,840","Wait, what?"
24,"00:01:39,842","00:01:41,709",I have. Once.
25,"00:01:41,711","00:01:44,410","And you've never
told us this before?"
26,"00:01:44,412","00:01:46,515","Well, I could
tell you now, if you..."
27,"00:01:48,017","00:01:49,850","- Okay. Now.
- Tell us now."
28,"00:01:49,852","00:01:51,386",Are you sure about this?
29,"00:01:51,921","00:01:53,721",It's time they know.
30,"00:01:53,723","00:01:55,421","Let's make
a big snowman later."
31,"00:01:55,423","00:01:56,959","If they can settle
and listen."
32,"00:02:00,029","00:02:01,294",Far away...
33,"00:02:01,296","00:02:03,296",as north as we can go...
34,"00:02:03,298","00:02:07,467","stood a very old
and very enchanted forest."
35,"00:02:07,469","00:02:09,036",But its magic wasn't that of
36,"00:02:09,038","00:02:11,772","goblin spells
and lost fairies."
37,"00:02:11,774","00:02:14,844","It was protected by the most
powerful spirits of all..."
38,"00:02:15,912","00:02:17,046",those of air...
39,"00:02:17,780","00:02:18,781",of fire...
40,"00:02:19,916","00:02:21,017",of water...
41,"00:02:21,951","00:02:23,618",and earth.
42,"00:02:28,557","00:02:29,824",But it was also home
43,"00:02:29,826","00:02:32,226","to the mysterious
Northuldra people."
44,"00:02:32,228","00:02:34,762","Were the
Northuldra magical, like me?"
45,"00:02:34,764","00:02:37,530","No, Elsa.
They were not magical."
46,"00:02:37,532","00:02:40,903","They just took advantage
of the Forest's gifts."
47,"00:02:41,838","00:02:44,705","Their ways
were so different from ours..."
48,"00:02:44,707","00:02:47,542","but still,
they promised us friendship."
49,"00:02:48,110","00:02:49,409","In honor of that,"
50,"00:02:49,411","00:02:51,377","your grandfather,
King Runeard,"
51,"00:02:51,379","00:02:53,013",built them a mighty dam...
52,"00:02:53,015","00:02:54,982",to strengthen their waters.
53,"00:02:54,984","00:02:56,416",It was a gift of peace.
54,"00:02:56,418","00:02:59,019",That's a big gift of peace.
55,"00:02:59,021","00:03:00,386",And I was so honored
56,"00:03:00,388","00:03:02,388","to get to go to the Forest
to celebrate it."
57,"00:03:02,390","00:03:03,726","Stand tall, Agnarr."
58,"00:03:04,694","00:03:06,193","I wasn't
at all prepared"
59,"00:03:06,195","00:03:07,897",for what the day would bring.
60,"00:03:10,365","00:03:11,901",We let down our guard.
61,"00:03:14,136","00:03:15,370",We were charmed.
62,"00:03:15,771","00:03:16,839",Whoa. Whoa!
63,"00:03:18,440","00:03:20,174",It felt so...
64,"00:03:20,176","00:03:21,376",magical.
65,"00:03:35,624","00:03:37,425",But something went wrong.
66,"00:03:39,929","00:03:41,163",They were attacking us.
67,"00:03:41,931","00:03:43,065",Get behind me.
68,"00:03:44,767","00:03:46,568","It was
a brutal battle."
69,"00:03:47,770","00:03:49,136",Your grandfather...
70,"00:03:49,138","00:03:50,204",Father!
71,"00:03:50,206","00:03:51,272",...was lost.
72,"00:03:51,274","00:03:52,605",Aah!
73,"00:03:52,607","00:03:54,576","The fighting
enraged the spirits."
74,"00:03:55,477","00:03:56,944",Look out!
75,"00:03:56,946","00:03:59,148","They turned
their magic against us all."
76,"00:04:08,623","00:04:11,193",There was this voice...
77,"00:04:16,065","00:04:18,500",...and someone saved me.
78,"00:04:21,003","00:04:25,105","I'm told the spirits
then vanished."
79,"00:04:25,107","00:04:29,109","And a powerful mist
covered the Forest."
80,"00:04:29,111","00:04:31,247",Locking everyone out.
81,"00:04:34,817","00:04:40,655","And that night, I came home
King of Arendelle."
82,"00:04:42,590","00:04:46,193","Whoa, Papa, that was epic."
83,"00:04:46,195","00:04:48,329","Whoever saved you,"
84,"00:04:48,331","00:04:50,463",I love them.
85,"00:04:50,465","00:04:52,700","I wish I knew
who it was."
86,"00:04:52,702","00:04:54,600",What happened to the spirits?
87,"00:04:54,602","00:04:56,203",What's in the Forest now?
88,"00:04:56,205","00:04:57,771",I don't know.
89,"00:04:57,773","00:05:00,374","The mist
still stands."
90,"00:05:00,376","00:05:02,309","No one
can get in."
91,"00:05:02,311","00:05:04,211","And no one
has since come out."
92,"00:05:04,213","00:05:05,679",So we're safe.
93,"00:05:05,681","00:05:06,747",Yes.
94,"00:05:06,749","00:05:08,449","But the Forest
could wake again."
95,"00:05:08,451","00:05:12,652","And we must be prepared for
whatever danger it may bring."
96,"00:05:12,654","00:05:13,954","And on that note,"
97,"00:05:13,956","00:05:15,588","how about we say good night
to your father?"
98,"00:05:15,590","00:05:19,293","But I still
have so many questions."
99,"00:05:19,295","00:05:20,995","Save them
for another night, Anna."
100,"00:05:20,997","00:05:23,966","You know I don't
have that kind of patience."
101,"00:05:25,101","00:05:27,935","Why did Northuldra
attack us anyway?"
102,"00:05:27,937","00:05:30,004","Who attacks people
who give them gifts?"
103,"00:05:30,006","00:05:32,975","Do you think the
Forest will wake again?"
104,"00:05:35,444","00:05:37,179",Only Ahtohallan knows.
105,"00:05:37,612","00:05:39,215",Octa-who-what?
106,"00:05:41,283","00:05:43,684",When I was little...
107,"00:05:43,686","00:05:44,952","my mother
would sing a song"
108,"00:05:44,954","00:05:47,988","about a special river
called Ahtohallan..."
109,"00:05:47,990","00:05:51,225","that was said to hold all
the answers about the past."
110,"00:05:51,227","00:05:53,093","About what we are
a part of."
111,"00:05:53,095","00:05:54,161",Wow.
112,"00:05:54,163","00:05:56,298","Will you sing it
for us? Please?"
113,"00:05:57,967","00:05:58,999",Okay.
114,"00:05:59,001","00:06:00,834",Cuddle close.
115,"00:06:00,836","00:06:03,172",Scooch in.

144,"00:08:05,327","00:08:06,328",What?
145,"00:08:08,397","00:08:09,431",Never mind.
146,"00:08:29,385","00:08:32,252","Enjoying
your new permafrost, Olaf?"
147,"00:08:32,254","00:08:35,289","I'm just living

151,"00:08:41,497","00:08:42,863",What's that?
152,"00:08:42,865","00:08:44,533","Forgive me.
Maturity is making me poetic."
153,"00:08:45,968","00:08:47,734","Tell me, you're older
and thus all-knowing..."
154,"00:08:47,736","00:08:49,836","do you ever worry
about the notion that..."
155,"00:08:49,838","00:08:51,705",nothing is permanent?
156,"00:08:51,707","00:08:53,574",Uh... No.

158,"00:08:54,910","00:08:57,679","Wow, I can't wait until
I'm ancient like you..."
159,"00:08:57,681","00:09:00,847","so I don't have to worry

on one knee?"
183,"00:10:13,690","00:10:16,623","♪ Yeah, but I'm really bad
at planning these things out"
184,"00:10:16,625","00:10:19,526","♪ Like candlelight and
pulling of rings out"
185,"00:10:19,528","00:10:24,298","♪ Maybe you should leave
all the romantic stuff to me!"
186,"00:10:24,300","00:10:27,801","♪ Yeah, some things
never change"
187,"00:10:27,803","00:10:30,170","♪ Like the love
that I feel for her"
188,"00:10:30,172","00:10:33,040",♪ Some things stay the same
189,"00:10:33,042","00:10:35,175","♪ Like how reindeers
are easier"
190,"00:10:35,177","00:10:38,178","♪ But if I commit
and I go for it"
191,"00:10:38,180","00:10:41,281","♪ I'll know
what to say and do!"
192,"00:10:41,283","00:10:42,249",♪ Right?
193,"00:10:42,251","00:10:45,819",♪ Some things never change
194,"00:10:45,821","00:10:48,557","♪ Sven, the pressure
is all on you"
195,"00:10:53,529","00:10:55,228",♪ The winds are restless
196,"00:10:55,230","00:10:58,632","♪ Could that be why
I'm hearing this call?"
197,"00:10:58,634","00:11:00,300",♪ Is something coming?

Father warned us about?"
392,"00:21:48,818","00:21:49,683",Yes.
393,"00:21:49,685","00:21:51,251",Why would you do that?
394,"00:21:51,253","00:21:53,653",Because of the voice.
395,"00:21:53,655","00:21:56,589",I know it sounds crazy...
396,"00:21:56,591","00:21:59,659","but I believe whoever
is calling me is good."
397,"00:21:59,661","00:22:02,062","How can you say that?
Look at our kingdom."
398,"00:22:02,064","00:22:06,499","I know. It's just that
my magic can feel it."
399,"00:22:06,501","00:22:08,070",I can feel it.
400,"00:22:09,071","00:22:10,503",Okay.
401,"00:22:10,505","00:22:13,606","Oh, no. What now?"
402,"00:22:13,608","00:22:15,376",The Trolls?
403,"00:22:15,378","00:22:18,280","- Kristoff! We missed you!
- Oh!"
404,"00:22:19,015","00:22:20,214",Pabbie.
405,"00:22:20,216","00:22:23,250","Well, never a dull moment
with you two."
406,"00:22:23,252","00:22:26,286","I hope you're prepared
for what you have done, Elsa."
407,"00:22:26,288","00:22:30,157","Angry magical spirits are not
for the faint of heart."
408,"00:22:30,159","00:22:31,992",Why are they still angry?
409,"00:22:31,994","00:22:34,428","What does all of this
have to do with Arendelle?"
410,"00:22:34,430","00:22:36,232","Let me see
what I can see."
411,"00:22:38,901","00:22:42,705","The past is not
what it seems."
412,"00:22:43,538","00:22:46,373",A wrong demands to be righted.
413,"00:22:46,375","00:22:49,410",Arendelle is not safe.
414,"00:22:49,412","00:22:52,980",The truth must be found.
415,"00:22:52,982","00:22:54,083",Without it...
416,"00:22:55,418","00:22:57,585",I see no future.
417,"00:22:58,220","00:22:59,686",No future?
418,"00:22:59,688","00:23:01,955","When one can see
no future..."
419,"00:23:01,957","00:23:06,126","all one can do
is the next right thing."
420,"00:23:06,128","00:23:08,095",The next right thing
421,"00:23:08,097","00:23:10,030","is for me to go
to the Enchanted Forest..."
422,"00:23:10,032","00:23:11,664",and find that voice.
423,"00:23:11,666","00:23:12,866","Kristoff, can I borrow
your wagon"
424,"00:23:12,868","00:23:14,034","- and Sven?
- Hmm?"
425,"00:23:14,036","00:23:15,635","I'm not very comfortable
with the idea of that."
426,"00:23:15,637","00:23:17,871","- You are not going alone.
- Anna, no."
427,"00:23:17,873","00:23:20,573","I have my powers
to protect me. You don't."
428,"00:23:20,575","00:23:22,276","Excuse me, I climbed
the North Mountain..."
429,"00:23:22,278","00:23:23,444","survived a frozen heart,"
430,"00:23:23,446","00:23:24,511","and saved you
from my ex-boyfriend..."
431,"00:23:24,513","00:23:25,846","and I did it
all without powers,"
432,"00:23:25,848","00:23:27,448","so, you know, I'm coming."
433,"00:23:27,450","00:23:28,782","Me, too. I'll drive."
434,"00:23:28,784","00:23:30,484",I'll bring the snacks!
435,"00:23:30,486","00:23:32,553","I will look
after your people."
436,"00:23:32,555","00:23:33,653",Please make sure they stay
437,"00:23:33,655","00:23:35,289","out of the kingdom
until we return."
438,"00:23:35,291","00:23:36,790",Of course.
439,"00:23:36,792","00:23:38,425",Let's let them know.
440,"00:23:38,427","00:23:41,361","Anna, I am worried
for her."
441,"00:23:41,363","00:23:42,763",We have always feared
442,"00:23:42,765","00:23:45,532","Elsa's powers were too much
for this world."
443,"00:23:45,534","00:23:49,071","Now, we must pray
they are enough."
444,"00:23:50,773","00:23:52,942","I won't let anything
happen to her."
445,"00:23:53,409","00:23:54,944",Hyah!
446,"00:23:58,380","00:24:00,280",Who's into trivia?
447,"00:24:00,282","00:24:01,849",I am. Okay.
448,"00:24:01,851","00:24:04,518","Did you know that water
has memory? True fact."
449,"00:24:04,520","00:24:06,720","It's disputed by many,
but it's true."
450,"00:24:06,722","00:24:08,021","Did you know
men are six times"
451,"00:24:08,023","00:24:09,723","more likely to be
struck by lightning?"
452,"00:24:09,725","00:24:11,925","Did you know gorillas
burp when they're happy?"
453,"00:24:11,927","00:24:14,528","Did you know we blink
four million times a day?"
454,"00:24:14,530","00:24:16,497","Did you know
wombats poop squares?"
455,"00:24:16,499","00:24:17,798","Did you know
sleeping quietly"
456,"00:24:17,800","00:24:19,502","on long journeys
prevents insanity?"
457,"00:24:21,003","00:24:22,503","- Yeah, that's not true.
- It is."
458,"00:24:22,505","00:24:23,704","- It's true.
- Definitely true."
459,"00:24:23,706","00:24:25,139","No, it's the truth."
460,"00:24:25,141","00:24:26,773","Well,
that was unanimous."
461,"00:24:26,775","00:24:28,711","But I will look it up
when we get home."
462,"00:24:31,247","00:24:33,046",They're both asleep.
463,"00:24:33,048","00:24:36,118","So, what do you
wanna do?"
464,"00:24:38,154","00:24:41,157","Sven, keep us steady,
will ya?"
465,"00:24:43,025","00:24:44,825","- Hmm...
- Anna. Ahem."
466,"00:24:44,827","00:24:45,959","- Anna?
- Mm-hmm?"
467,"00:24:45,961","00:24:47,828","Remember
our first trip like this..."
468,"00:24:47,830","00:24:49,963","when I said
you'd have to be crazy"
469,"00:24:49,965","00:24:51,765","to want to marry
a man you just met?"
470,"00:24:51,767","00:24:53,400","Wait, what? Crazy?"
471,"00:24:53,402","00:24:56,170","You didn't say I was crazy.
You think I'm crazy?"
472,"00:24:56,172","00:24:57,738",No. I did.
473,"00:24:57,740","00:24:59,573","- You were...
- Huh?"
474,"00:24:59,575","00:25:00,774",...not crazy.
475,"00:25:00,776","00:25:02,209",Clearly.
476,"00:25:02,211","00:25:03,844",Just naive.
477,"00:25:03,846","00:25:07,347","Not naive. Just, uh,
new to love. Like I was."
478,"00:25:07,349","00:25:11,952","And when you're new,
you're bound to get it wrong."
479,"00:25:11,954","00:25:13,987","So you're saying
I'm wrong for you."
480,"00:25:13,989","00:25:16,056","What? No, no.
I'm not saying"
481,"00:25:16,058","00:25:18,659","you're wrong, or crazy."
482,"00:25:18,661","00:25:20,894","- Kristoff, stop. Please.
- Good idea."
483,"00:25:20,896","00:25:22,596","I hear it.
I hear the voice."
484,"00:25:22,598","00:25:24,565",You do?
485,"00:25:24,567","00:25:27,603","Olaf, wake up."
486,"00:25:30,372","00:25:32,474","- Whoa.
- Wow."
487,"00:25:56,632","00:25:58,534",Whoa! What the...
488,"00:26:17,486","00:26:19,021",Whoa.
489,"00:26:25,961","00:26:28,829","Promise me,
we do this together, okay?"
490,"00:26:28,831","00:26:30,332",I promise.
491,"00:26:39,541","00:26:41,108",It's okay.
492,"00:26:41,110","00:26:43,477","Did you know
that an enchanted forest"
493,"00:26:43,479","00:26:45,078","is a place
of transformation?"
494,"00:26:45,080","00:26:47,014","I have no idea
what that means..."
495,"00:26:47,016","00:26:48,882",but I can't wait to see
496,"00:26:48,884","00:26:52,554","what it's gonna do
to each one of us."
497,"00:26:53,789","00:26:55,188","- Hey!
- What is this?"
498,"00:26:55,190","00:26:56,691","- No pushing.
- Stop it."
499,"00:26:56,693","00:26:58,027","- Whoa, whoa, whoa!
- It's too fast."
500,"00:26:58,594","00:26:59,696",What was that?
501,"00:27:01,765","00:27:03,365","No. No, no, no."
502,"00:27:05,434","00:27:07,034",And we're locked in.
503,"00:27:07,036","00:27:09,038","Probably should have seen
that one coming."
504,"00:27:10,839","00:27:13,375",This forest is beautiful.
505,"00:27:14,176","00:27:15,210",Ooh.
506,"00:27:39,034","00:27:42,804",The dam. It still stands.
507,"00:27:42,806","00:27:45,639","It was
in Grand Pabbie's visions."
508,"00:27:45,641","00:27:47,140",But why?
509,"00:27:47,142","00:27:49,976","I don't know, but it's still
in good shape. Thank goodness."
510,"00:27:49,978","00:27:51,078",What do you mean?
511,"00:27:51,080","00:27:52,279","Well, if that dam broke..."
512,"00:27:52,281","00:27:54,314","it would send
a tidal wave so big"
513,"00:27:54,316","00:27:56,883","it would wash away
everything on this fjord."
514,"00:27:56,885","00:27:58,285",Everything?
515,"00:27:58,287","00:28:00,822","But Arendelle's
on this fjord."
516,"00:28:00,824","00:28:02,956","Nothing's gonna happen
to Arendelle, Anna."
517,"00:28:02,958","00:28:04,458",It's gonna be fine.
518,"00:28:04,460","00:28:06,195",Come here.
519,"00:28:11,701","00:28:14,401","You know,
under different circumstances,"
520,"00:28:14,403","00:28:17,871","this would be a, uh,
pretty romantic place."
521,"00:28:17,873","00:28:18,939",Don't you think?
522,"00:28:18,941","00:28:20,006",Different circumstances?
523,"00:28:20,008","00:28:21,408","You mean,
like with someone else?"
524,"00:28:21,410","00:28:23,043",What? No! No.
525,"00:28:23,045","00:28:24,411",I'm saying...
526,"00:28:24,413","00:28:25,813","Just in case we don't
make it out of here..."
527,"00:28:25,815","00:28:27,013","Wait, what?"
528,"00:28:27,015","00:28:28,415","You don't think we're gonna
make it out of here?"
529,"00:28:28,417","00:28:29,751",No. No!
530,"00:28:29,753","00:28:31,284","I mean, no,
we will make it out of here."
531,"00:28:31,286","00:28:32,787","Well, technically the odds
are kind of complicated,"
532,"00:28:32,789","00:28:34,388",but my point is...
533,"00:28:34,390","00:28:35,622",In case we die...
534,"00:28:35,624","00:28:38,024","- You think we're gonna die?
- No! No, no, no."
535,"00:28:38,026","00:28:39,292","- Where's Elsa?
- We will die at some point."
536,"00:28:39,294","00:28:40,427","I swore that
I wouldn't leave her side."
537,"00:28:40,429","00:28:41,863","Not in any
recent time will we die."
538,"00:28:41,865","00:28:43,363","- Elsa!
- But way far in the future,"
539,"00:28:43,365","00:28:44,533",we will die.
540,"00:28:48,537","00:28:50,639",Don't patronize me.
541,"00:28:59,448","00:29:00,748",Elsa!
542,"00:29:00,750","00:29:02,082",There you are.
543,"00:29:02,084","00:29:04,351","- You okay?
- I'm fine."
544,"00:29:04,353","00:29:06,021","Okay, good."
545,"00:29:06,455","00:29:08,157",Where's Olaf?
546,"00:29:08,390","00:29:09,556",Um...
547,"00:29:09,558","00:29:10,626",Anna?
548,"00:29:11,193","00:29:12,559",Elsa?
549,"00:29:12,561","00:29:14,096",Sven?
550,"00:29:14,530","00:29:16,231",Samantha?
551,"00:29:18,600","00:29:21,503","I don't even know
a Samantha."
552,"00:29:24,640","00:29:25,708",Whoa!
553,"00:29:28,377","00:29:29,378",Mm.
554,"00:29:32,347","00:29:33,683",That's normal.
555,"00:29:46,028","00:29:48,197",What was that?

583,"00:31:39,575","00:31:42,578","I'd hold your hair back,
but I can't find my arms."
584,"00:31:50,687","00:31:52,421",Hey! Stop!
585,"00:32:04,499","00:32:05,500",Elsa!
586,"00:32:08,637","00:32:10,372",Let her go!
587,"00:32:14,376","00:32:16,144","Anna,
be careful!"
588,"00:32:16,713","00:32:18,380",That's my sister!
589,"00:32:22,685","00:32:24,453",Prince Agnarr!
590,"00:32:27,790","00:32:28,992",For Arendelle.
591,"00:32:31,894","00:32:32,895",Look out!
592,"00:32:34,363","00:32:35,798",Father!
593,"00:32:44,907","00:32:47,110","- Are you okay?
- I'm fine."
594,"00:32:48,310","00:32:50,911",What are these?
595,"00:32:50,913","00:32:54,949","Oh, they look like
moments in time."
596,"00:32:54,951","00:32:56,817","What's that thing
you say, Olaf?"
597,"00:32:56,819","00:32:58,284",The thing... Oh!
598,"00:32:58,286","00:33:00,286","My theory about
advancing technologies"
599,"00:33:00,288","00:33:01,689","as both our savior
and our doom?"
600,"00:33:01,691","00:33:04,157","No, not that one.
The one about..."
601,"00:33:04,159","00:33:05,392","- The one about cucumbers?
- No."
602,"00:33:05,394","00:33:06,459",The thing about water.
603,"00:33:06,461","00:33:09,096","Oh! Yeah.
Water has memory."
604,"00:33:09,098","00:33:10,664","The water that
makes up you and me"
605,"00:33:10,666","00:33:12,900","has passed through
at least four humans..."
606,"00:33:12,902","00:33:14,837",and/or animals before us.
607,"00:33:15,772","00:33:17,071",Hmm.
608,"00:33:17,073","00:33:19,541",And remembers everything.
609,"00:33:20,642","00:33:22,877",The wind's back.
610,"00:33:22,879","00:33:25,112",Delicious.
611,"00:33:25,114","00:33:27,917","I think
I'll name you Gale."
612,"00:33:29,686","00:33:32,086",Get out of there. Whoa!
613,"00:33:32,088","00:33:34,090","- Oh. Hi.
- Aren't you curious?"
614,"00:33:35,792","00:33:37,960",You in a better mood now?
615,"00:33:48,071","00:33:51,440","Father.
That's Father."
616,"00:33:53,176","00:33:54,775",This girl.
617,"00:33:54,777","00:33:56,911",She's saving him.
618,"00:33:56,913","00:33:58,181",She's Northuldra.
619,"00:34:00,750","00:34:02,116",What is that?
620,"00:34:02,118","00:34:03,920","Olaf, get behind me."
621,"00:34:06,455","00:34:07,888","What are you gonna
do with that?"
622,"00:34:07,890","00:34:09,058",I have no idea.
623,"00:34:22,939","00:34:24,671",Lower your weapon.
624,"00:34:24,673","00:34:27,307",And you lower yours.
625,"00:34:27,309","00:34:29,442",Arendellian soldiers?
626,"00:34:29,444","00:34:31,377","Threatening my people,
Lieutenant?"
627,"00:34:31,379","00:34:34,181","Invading my dance space,
Yelena?"
628,"00:34:34,183","00:34:35,348","Why does that soldier
look so familiar?"
629,"00:34:35,350","00:34:36,751","No, no, no."
630,"00:34:36,753","00:34:37,818",Lieutenant!
631,"00:34:37,820","00:34:38,755",Get the sword!
632,"00:34:46,729","00:34:48,328",That was magic.
633,"00:34:48,330","00:34:49,830",Did you see that?
634,"00:34:49,832","00:34:51,999",Of course I saw it.
635,"00:34:52,001","00:34:53,633","You chose a nice,
cold greeting."
636,"00:34:53,635","00:34:55,468","They've been trapped in
here this whole time?"
637,"00:34:55,470","00:34:57,138","- Yeah.
- What do we do now?"
638,"00:34:57,140","00:34:58,340",I got this.
639,"00:34:58,775","00:35:00,076","Hi, I'm Olaf."
640,"00:35:01,844","00:35:05,012","Oh, sorry. Yeah, I just
find clothes restricting."
641,"00:35:05,014","00:35:07,248","Bet you're wondering who
we are and why we're here."
642,"00:35:07,250","00:35:09,116",It's really quite simple.
643,"00:35:09,118","00:35:11,417",It began with two sisters.
644,"00:35:11,419","00:35:13,286",One born with magical powers.
645,"00:35:13,288","00:35:14,688",One born powerless.
646,"00:35:14,690","00:35:16,623","Their love of snowmen,
infinite."
647,"00:35:16,625","00:35:18,291","Anna, no! Too high!"
648,"00:35:18,293","00:35:19,526",Blast!
649,"00:35:19,528","00:35:21,262",Mama! Papa! Help!
650,"00:35:21,264","00:35:23,396","Slam!
Doors shutting everywhere."
651,"00:35:23,398","00:35:25,465",Sisters torn apart.
652,"00:35:25,467","00:35:27,567","Well, at least
they have their parents."
653,"00:35:27,569","00:35:29,435",Their parents are dead.
654,"00:35:29,437","00:35:31,371","Oh.
Oh, hi. I'm Anna."
655,"00:35:31,373","00:35:32,706",I'll marry a man I just met.
656,"00:35:32,708","00:35:34,175",Elsa's gonna blow!
657,"00:35:34,177","00:35:36,543","Snow! Snow! Aah, run!"
658,"00:35:36,545","00:35:38,779","Magic pulses
through my snowflakes."
659,"00:35:38,781","00:35:40,346",I live.
660,"00:35:40,348","00:35:43,117","Ice palace for one.
Ice palace for one."
661,"00:35:43,119","00:35:44,852","Get out, Anna.
Pew! Pew!"
662,"00:35:44,854","00:35:46,987","- My heart.
- Oh, my goodness."
663,"00:35:46,989","00:35:48,823","Only an act
of true love can save you."
664,"00:35:48,825","00:35:50,860","Here's
a true love's kiss."
665,"00:35:51,526","00:35:52,993",You're not worth it.
666,"00:35:52,995","00:35:54,627","Guess what?
I'm the bad guy."
667,"00:35:54,629","00:35:56,063",What?
668,"00:35:56,065","00:35:59,233","And Anna
freezes to death forever."
669,"00:35:59,235","00:36:00,903","Oh, Anna."
670,"00:36:01,503","00:36:02,837",Then she unfreezes!
671,"00:36:02,839","00:36:04,537","Oh, and then Elsa woke up
the magical spirits..."
672,"00:36:04,539","00:36:06,006","and we were forced
out of our kingdom."
673,"00:36:06,008","00:36:07,574","Now our only hope is to find
the truth about the past..."
674,"00:36:07,576","00:36:09,043","but we don't have a clue
how to do that..."
675,"00:36:09,045","00:36:10,410","except Elsa's hearing voices,"
676,"00:36:10,412","00:36:11,912",so we got that going for us.
677,"00:36:11,914","00:36:13,448",Any questions?
678,"00:36:16,185","00:36:17,854",I think they got it.
679,"00:36:19,354","00:36:21,222","Are you really
Queen of Arendelle?"
680,"00:36:21,224","00:36:22,388",I am.
681,"00:36:22,390","00:36:23,556",Why would nature reward
682,"00:36:23,558","00:36:25,525","a person of Arendelle
with magic?"
683,"00:36:25,527","00:36:27,895","Perhaps to make up for the
actions of your people."
684,"00:36:27,897","00:36:29,596",My people are innocent.
685,"00:36:29,598","00:36:31,631","We would have never
attacked first."
686,"00:36:31,633","00:36:33,200",May the truth be found.
687,"00:36:33,202","00:36:35,368","- Mm...
- Hi. I'm sorry."
688,"00:36:35,370","00:36:37,204","- Uh, what's happening?
- Hmm."
689,"00:36:37,206","00:36:39,372","That's it.
Lieutenant Mattias!"
690,"00:36:39,374","00:36:41,208","Library, second portrait
on the left."
691,"00:36:41,210","00:36:43,578","You were our father's
official guard."
692,"00:36:43,980","00:36:45,746",Agnarr.
693,"00:36:45,748","00:36:47,647","What did happen
to your parents?"
694,"00:36:47,649","00:36:50,918","Our parents' ship went
down in the Southern Sea..."
695,"00:36:50,920","00:36:52,021",six years ago.
696,"00:36:56,726","00:36:59,960","I see him.
I see him in your faces."
697,"00:36:59,962","00:37:01,028",Really?
698,"00:37:01,030","00:37:02,495",Soldiers.
699,"00:37:02,497","00:37:05,498","We may be getting on in years,
but we're still strong."
700,"00:37:05,500","00:37:07,837",And proud to serve Arendelle.
701,"00:37:09,038","00:37:11,038",Wait. Please.
702,"00:37:11,040","00:37:13,107",Someone has called me here.
703,"00:37:13,109","00:37:15,242",If I can just find them...
704,"00:37:15,244","00:37:16,476","I believe
they have the answers"
705,"00:37:16,478","00:37:19,412","that may help us
free this forest."
706,"00:37:19,414","00:37:21,648","Trust me,
I just want to help."
707,"00:37:21,650","00:37:24,151",We only trust nature.
708,"00:37:24,153","00:37:25,888",When nature speaks...
709,"00:37:28,456","00:37:29,656",...we listen.
710,"00:37:29,658","00:37:31,894","This will all
make sense when I'm older."
711,"00:37:33,528","00:37:34,830",Fire Spirit!
712,"00:37:36,531","00:37:38,065","Get back, everyone!"
713,"00:37:38,067","00:37:39,936",Head for the river!
714,"00:37:49,845","00:37:52,212","No! No! No! The reindeer!
That's a dead end!"
715,"00:37:52,214","00:37:53,215","Come on, Sven!"
716,"00:37:53,883","00:37:55,184",We'll get them.
717,"00:37:58,087","00:38:00,022",Elsa! Get out of there!
718,"00:38:00,990","00:38:01,991","No, no, no."
719,"00:38:06,929","00:38:08,097",Elsa!
720,"00:38:19,607","00:38:22,078","Come on, buddy,
we can do this. Hyah!"
721,"00:38:26,949","00:38:27,917",Anna!
722,"00:38:32,955","00:38:34,355",Oh!
723,"00:38:34,357","00:38:35,521",Get her out of here.
724,"00:38:35,523","00:38:37,893",No! Elsa!
725,"00:39:51,867","00:39:54,070","They're all looking at us,
aren't they?"
726,"00:39:56,038","00:39:57,306",Got any advice?
727,"00:39:59,208","00:40:01,375",Nothing?
728,"00:40:01,377","00:40:03,578","Hmm. Should I know
what that means?"
729,"00:40:06,315","00:40:08,682","You hear it, too."
730,"00:40:08,684","00:40:10,751",Somebody's calling us.
731,"00:40:10,753","00:40:13,422","Who is it?
What do we do?"
732,"00:40:21,629","00:40:23,999","Okay, keep going north."
733,"00:40:26,836","00:40:27,801",Elsa!
734,"00:40:27,803","00:40:29,036","- Oh, thank goodness!
- Anna."
735,"00:40:29,038","00:40:31,171","- Are you okay?
- What were you doing?"
736,"00:40:31,173","00:40:32,272",You could've been killed.
737,"00:40:32,274","00:40:34,441","You can't just follow me
into fire."
738,"00:40:34,443","00:40:36,642","You don't want me
to follow you into fire,"
739,"00:40:36,644","00:40:39,645",then don't run into fire.
740,"00:40:39,647","00:40:42,685","You're not
being careful, Elsa."
741,"00:40:44,520","00:40:47,521","I'm sorry.
Are you okay?"
742,"00:40:47,523","00:40:49,523",I've been better.
743,"00:40:49,525","00:40:52,695","Hmm. I know
what you need."
744,"00:40:55,865","00:40:57,733","Where did you
get that scarf?"
745,"00:40:58,501","00:41:00,467",That's a Northuldra scarf.
746,"00:41:00,469","00:41:01,634",What?
747,"00:41:01,636","00:41:04,571","This is from one of
our oldest families."
748,"00:41:04,573","00:41:06,208",It was our mother's.
749,"00:41:15,184","00:41:16,617",Elsa.
750,"00:41:16,619","00:41:18,018",I see it.
751,"00:41:18,020","00:41:20,154",It's Mother.
752,"00:41:20,156","00:41:23,425","Mother saved
Father's life that day."
753,"00:41:27,429","00:41:29,698",Our mother was Northuldra.
754,"00:42:30,726","00:42:32,993",We are called Northuldra.
755,"00:42:32,995","00:42:36,165",We are the people of the sun.
756,"00:42:38,267","00:42:41,835","I promise you I will
free this forest..."
757,"00:42:41,837","00:42:43,339",and restore Arendelle.
758,"00:42:44,607","00:42:46,542","That's a pretty
big promise, Elsa."
759,"00:42:48,177","00:42:51,113","Free the Forest?
Wow."
760,"00:42:51,547","00:42:52,680",I'm sorry.
761,"00:42:52,682","00:42:54,448","It's just, uh, some of us
were born in here,"
762,"00:42:54,450","00:42:56,583","we've never even seen
a clear sky."
763,"00:42:56,585","00:42:57,784",I get it.
764,"00:42:57,786","00:42:59,753","- The name's Ryder.
- Kristoff."
765,"00:42:59,755","00:43:01,321",I heard the voice again.
766,"00:43:01,323","00:43:02,789",We need to go north.
767,"00:43:02,791","00:43:05,225","But the Earth Giants now
roam the north at night."
768,"00:43:05,227","00:43:07,427","You can leave
in the morning."
769,"00:43:07,429","00:43:08,595",I'm Honeymaren.
770,"00:43:08,597","00:43:11,000","Honeymaren,
we'll do all we can."
771,"00:43:14,503","00:43:15,869","Hey, let me ask you."
772,"00:43:15,871","00:43:17,037",How do you guys cope...
773,"00:43:17,039","00:43:19,172","with the ever-increasing
complexity of thought"
774,"00:43:19,174","00:43:21,477",that comes with maturity?
775,"00:43:22,344","00:43:23,944",Brilliant!
776,"00:43:23,946","00:43:25,279",Oh!
777,"00:43:25,281","00:43:27,447","It's so refreshing to talk
to the youth of today."
778,"00:43:27,449","00:43:28,849","Our future's
in bright hands."
779,"00:43:28,851","00:43:30,183","Oh, no, no.
Don't chew that."
780,"00:43:30,185","00:43:32,085","You don't know
what I've stepped in."
781,"00:43:32,087","00:43:33,920","I can't seem
to get her attention."
782,"00:43:33,922","00:43:35,555","Or even say
the right thing."
783,"00:43:35,557","00:43:37,024","Well, you're in luck."
784,"00:43:37,026","00:43:39,126","I know nothing
about women."
785,"00:43:39,128","00:43:40,227","But I do know
that we have"
786,"00:43:40,229","00:43:43,230","the most amazing way

788,"00:43:44,300","00:43:45,565","- we'll be ready by dawn.
- Really?"
789,"00:43:45,567","00:43:46,768","Best part,"
790,"00:43:46,770","00:43:48,302","it involves
a lot of reindeer."
791,"00:43:48,304","00:43:50,437",Whoa.
792,"00:43:50,439","00:43:51,638","Hey,
back at home..."
793,"00:43:51,640","00:43:53,540","Halima still over
at Hudson's Hearth?"
794,"00:43:53,542","00:43:54,608",She is.
795,"00:43:54,610","00:43:56,376","Really?
She married?"
796,"00:43:56,378","00:43:57,511",Mm-mm.
797,"00:43:57,513","00:44:00,682","Oh, wow. Why didn't that
make me feel better?"
798,"00:44:00,684","00:44:02,384",What else do you miss?
799,"00:44:03,218","00:44:04,786",My father.
800,"00:44:04,788","00:44:06,822","He passed
long before all this."
801,"00:44:07,956","00:44:10,624",He was a great man.
802,"00:44:10,626","00:44:12,159","Built us a good life
in Arendelle."
803,"00:44:12,161","00:44:15,128","But taught me to never take
the good for granted."
804,"00:44:15,130","00:44:17,497","He'd say, ""Be prepared."

808,"00:44:24,540","00:44:25,972",Don't give up.
809,"00:44:25,974","00:44:29,543","Take it one step
at a time and..."
810,"00:44:29,545","00:44:32,346","Just do
the next right thing?"
811,"00:44:32,348","00:44:33,815",Yeah.
812,"00:44:33,817","00:44:35,050",You got it.
813,"00:44:38,153","00:44:41,290","I wanna show you
something. May I?"
814,"00:44:44,059","00:44:46,694","You know air, fire,
water, and earth."
815,"00:44:46,696","00:44:48,028",Yes.
816,"00:44:48,030","00:44:49,596","But, look,
there's a fifth spirit..."
817,"00:44:49,598","00:44:53,300","said to be a bridge between
us and the magic of nature."
818,"00:44:53,302","00:44:54,601",A fifth spirit?
819,"00:44:54,603","00:44:55,869",Some say
820,"00:44:55,871","00:44:58,638","they heard it call out
the day the Forest fell."
821,"00:44:58,640","00:45:00,307",My father heard it.
822,"00:45:00,309","00:45:02,744","Do you think
that is who's calling me?"
823,"00:45:02,746","00:45:07,314","Maybe. Alas,
only Ahtohallan knows."
824,"00:45:07,316","00:45:09,017",Ahtohallan.

that all the time."
830,"00:45:27,503","00:45:29,302",Earth Giants.
831,"00:45:29,304","00:45:31,206","What are they
doing down here?"
832,"00:45:32,141","00:45:33,642",Shh!
833,"00:45:34,176","00:45:35,210",Hide.
834,"00:45:44,620","00:45:46,288",They're coming!
835,"00:45:54,731","00:45:57,232","This is why
we don't play with fire."
836,"00:45:58,367","00:46:01,704","Oh, I can't stay mad at you.
Why are you so cute?"
837,"00:46:27,496","00:46:31,164","Please tell me you were not
about to follow them."
838,"00:46:31,166","00:46:33,400","What if I can settle them
like I did the wind and fire?"
839,"00:46:33,402","00:46:35,168","Or what if
they can crush you"
840,"00:46:35,170","00:46:37,404","before you even
get the chance?"
841,"00:46:37,406","00:46:41,074","Remember, the goal
is to find the voice..."
842,"00:46:41,076","00:46:44,077","find the truth,
and get us home."
843,"00:46:44,079","00:46:46,313","Hey, guys.
That was close."
844,"00:46:46,315","00:46:47,614",I know.
845,"00:46:47,616","00:46:50,116","The giants sensed me.
They may come back here."
846,"00:46:50,118","00:46:52,619","I don't want to put anyone
at risk again."
847,"00:46:52,621","00:46:53,955","And you're right, Anna."
848,"00:46:53,957","00:46:55,923","We've got
to find the voice."
849,"00:46:55,925","00:46:57,123",We're going now.
850,"00:46:57,125","00:46:58,658",Okay. We're going.
851,"00:46:58,660","00:46:59,929",Let me just...
852,"00:47:02,164","00:47:04,732","Wait. Where are
Kristoff and Sven?"
853,"00:47:04,734","00:47:07,501","Oh, yeah. I think they
took off with that Ryder guy"
854,"00:47:07,503","00:47:08,736",and a bunch of reindeer.
855,"00:47:08,738","00:47:10,036","- They left?
- Mm-hmm."
856,"00:47:10,038","00:47:12,672","Just left
without saying anything?"
857,"00:47:12,674","00:47:14,711","Who knows
the ways of men?"
858,"00:47:21,918","00:47:24,685","Am I supposed to feel
this ridiculous?"
859,"00:47:24,687","00:47:26,121","Oh, yeah. Definitely."
860,"00:47:26,823","00:47:27,922",Everyone ready?
861,"00:47:27,924","00:47:29,055",Ready!
862,"00:47:29,057","00:47:30,257","Uh,
I could use a rehearsal."
863,"00:47:30,259","00:47:31,324",I love love.
864,"00:47:31,326","00:47:33,260","Wait. You talk
for them, too?"
865,"00:47:33,262","00:47:34,695",I do.
866,"00:47:34,697","00:47:36,263","It's like you can actually
hear what they're thinking."
867,"00:47:36,265","00:47:38,733","Yeah. And then
you just say it."
868,"00:47:38,735","00:47:40,168",And then you just say it.
869,"00:47:42,906","00:47:44,941",Okay. Here she comes.

what? What?"
877,"00:48:03,191","00:48:06,593","I wouldn't try to follow.
They're long gone."
878,"00:48:06,595","00:48:07,995",Long gone?
879,"00:48:07,997","00:48:10,499","So, yeah."
880,"00:48:11,567","00:48:14,267","Um, we're heading west
to the Lichen Meadows."

971,"00:54:33,448","00:54:35,448",Ahtohallan.
972,"00:54:35,450","00:54:37,151",It's real?
973,"00:54:37,153","00:54:38,385",Octa-who-what?
974,"00:54:38,387","00:54:39,920",Ahtohallan.
975,"00:54:39,922","00:54:41,654",It's a magical river
976,"00:54:41,656","00:54:44,158","said to hold all the
answers about the past."
977,"00:54:44,160","00:54:48,128","Reinforcing my ""water
has memory"" theory. Mm."
978,"00:54:48,130","00:54:49,832",Water has memory.
979,"00:54:56,372","00:54:58,471",Elsa?
980,"00:54:58,473","00:55:01,043","I wanna know
what happened to them."
981,"00:55:08,784","00:55:10,851","Ahtohallan has to be
the source of her magic."
982,"00:55:10,853","00:55:12,720","We keep going
for Elsa."
983,"00:55:12,722","00:55:13,988",The waves are too high!
984,"00:55:13,990","00:55:16,192","- Iduna!
- Agnarr!"
985,"00:55:19,594","00:55:21,163",Elsa!
986,"00:55:29,372","00:55:31,438","Hey, hey, hey,
what are you doing?"
987,"00:55:31,440","00:55:33,140",This is my fault.
988,"00:55:33,142","00:55:35,743","They were looking
for answers about me."
989,"00:55:35,745","00:55:39,079","You are not responsible
for their choices, Elsa."
990,"00:55:39,081","00:55:41,083",No. Just their deaths.
991,"00:55:41,384","00:55:43,083",Stop. No.
992,"00:55:43,085","00:55:45,819","Yelena asked,
why would the spirits"
993,"00:55:45,821","00:55:48,521","reward Arendelle
with a magical queen?"
994,"00:55:48,523","00:55:51,992","Because our mother
saved our father."
995,"00:55:51,994","00:55:54,028",She saved her enemy.
996,"00:55:54,030","00:55:58,332","Her good deed
was rewarded with you."
997,"00:55:58,334","00:56:00,034",You are a gift.
998,"00:56:00,036","00:56:01,301",For what?
999,"00:56:01,303","00:56:03,603","If anyone can resolve
the past..."
1000,"00:56:03,605","00:56:06,940","if anyone can save Arendelle
and free this forest,"
1001,"00:56:06,942","00:56:08,475",it's you.
1002,"00:56:08,477","00:56:12,782","I believe in you, Elsa.
More than anyone or anything."
1003,"00:56:19,554","00:56:22,156","Honeymaren said
there was a fifth spirit."
1004,"00:56:22,158","00:56:25,492","A bridge between
the magic of nature and us."
1005,"00:56:25,494","00:56:26,894",A fifth spirit?
1006,"00:56:26,896","00:56:29,963","That's who's been calling
me from Ahtohallan."
1007,"00:56:29,965","00:56:33,069","The answers about the
past are all there."
1008,"00:56:33,803","00:56:35,171",So we go to Ahtohallan.
1009,"00:56:36,439","00:56:37,840","Not ""we."""
1010,"00:56:38,507","00:56:40,007","- Me.
- What?"
1011,"00:56:40,009","00:56:42,476","The Dark Sea is too
dangerous for us both."
1012,"00:56:42,478","00:56:45,345","No. No!
We do this together."
1013,"00:56:45,347","00:56:46,713",Remember the song?
1014,"00:56:46,715","00:56:48,916","""Go too far and
you'll be drowned."""
1015,"00:56:48,918","00:56:51,285","Who will stop you
from going too far?"
1016,"00:56:51,287","00:56:52,519","You said you believed in me,"
1017,"00:56:52,521","00:56:54,054","that this is
what I was born to do."
1018,"00:56:54,056","00:56:57,324","And I don't wanna
stop you from that."
1019,"00:56:57,326","00:56:59,426","I... I don't
wanna stop you"
1020,"00:56:59,428","00:57:01,295","from being whatever
you need to be."
1021,"00:57:01,297","00:57:03,897","I just don't want
you dying..."
1022,"00:57:03,899","00:57:08,168","trying to be everything
for everyone else, too."
1023,"00:57:08,170","00:57:09,436",Don't do this alone.
1024,"00:57:09,438","00:57:12,339","Let me help you, please."
1025,"00:57:12,341","00:57:14,143","I can't lose you, Elsa."
1026,"00:57:17,079","00:57:19,815","I can't lose you
either, Anna."
1027,"00:57:20,883","00:57:23,052","- Come on.
- Mmm."
1028,"00:57:24,553","00:57:25,853","Wait, what?"
1029,"00:57:25,855","00:57:27,521",What are you doing?
1030,"00:57:27,523","00:57:28,791",Elsa!
1031,"00:57:31,659","00:57:33,327",No! No!
1032,"00:57:33,329","00:57:34,728","Olaf, help me stop."
1033,"00:57:34,730","00:57:36,265",Give me a hand.
1034,"00:57:39,368","00:57:41,335","- Hang on!
- Whoa!"
1035,"00:57:41,337","00:57:43,003","Wait. Wait!
No! No! No!"
1036,"00:57:43,005","00:57:44,805","Oh, come on!"
1037,"00:57:44,807","00:57:46,974","Anna,
this might sound crazy..."
1038,"00:57:46,976","00:57:49,510","but I'm sensing
some rising anger."
1039,"00:57:49,512","00:57:51,979","Well, I am angry, Olaf!"
1040,"00:57:51,981","00:57:54,748","She promised me
we'd do this together!"
1041,"00:57:54,750","00:57:56,283",Yeah. Uh-huh.
1042,"00:57:56,285","00:58:00,354","But what I mean is,
I'm sensing rising anger in me."
1043,"00:58:00,356","00:58:02,389","Wait, you're angry?"
1044,"00:58:02,391","00:58:04,525","Um, I... I think so."
1045,"00:58:04,527","00:58:06,493","Elsa pushed me away,
too,"
1046,"00:58:06,495","00:58:09,163","and didn't even
say goodbye."
1047,"00:58:09,165","00:58:12,665","And you have every right
to be very, very mad at her."
1048,"00:58:12,667","00:58:15,269","And you said some things
never change."
1049,"00:58:15,271","00:58:16,637","But since then,"
1050,"00:58:16,639","00:58:19,808","everything's done nothing
but change."
1051,"00:58:20,142","00:58:21,808",I know.
1052,"00:58:21,810","00:58:25,345","But look, I'm still here
holding your hand."
1053,"00:58:25,347","00:58:28,549","Yeah,
that's a good point, Anna."
1054,"00:58:28,551","00:58:30,751","I feel better.
You're such a good listener."
1055,"00:58:30,753","00:58:33,520",Don't shush me. That's rude.
1056,"00:58:33,522","00:58:35,591",No! No!
1057,"00:58:45,201","00:58:47,668",Oh. The Giants.
1058,"00:58:47,670","00:58:49,605",They're huge.
1059,"00:59:05,754","00:59:07,356","- Hang on, Olaf.
- Huh?"
1060,"00:59:12,661","00:59:14,430","Try not
to scream."
1061,"00:59:28,077","00:59:29,078",Found it.
1062,"00:59:30,646","00:59:32,279",Thank you.
1063,"00:59:32,281","00:59:34,448",Where are we?
1064,"00:59:34,450","00:59:36,817","In a pit
with no way out."
1065,"00:59:36,819","00:59:40,356","But with a spooky,
pitch-black way in."
1066,"00:59:46,462","00:59:48,128","Come on,
it'll be fun."
1067,"00:59:48,130","00:59:49,963","Assuming we don't
get stuck here forever,"
1068,"00:59:49,965","00:59:51,064",no one ever finds us...
1069,"00:59:51,066","00:59:53,267","and you starve
and I give up."
1070,"00:59:53,269","00:59:55,869","But, bright side,
Elsa's gotta be doing"
1071,"00:59:55,871","00:59:58,474","a whole lot
better than we are."
1072,"01:00:36,145","01:00:37,179",Okay.
1073,"01:00:47,623","01:00:49,091",Oh.
1074,"01:00:58,834","01:01:00,035",Whoa!

never trust them."
1163,"01:08:06,229","01:08:07,728",Grandfather?
1164,"01:08:07,730","01:08:10,563","Magic makes people feel too powerful.
Too entitled."
1165,"01:08:10,565","01:08:15,002","It makes them think they
can defy the will of a king."
1166,"01:08:15,004","01:08:16,971","That is not
what magic does."
1167,"01:08:16,973","01:08:18,571",That's just your fear.
1168,"01:08:18,573","01:08:20,810","Fear is what
can't be trusted."
1169,"01:08:27,817","01:08:30,350","You see, the dam
will weaken their lands,"
1170,"01:08:30,352","01:08:31,988","so they will
have to turn to me."
1171,"01:08:33,890","01:08:38,391","♪ Dive down
deep into her sound"
1172,"01:08:38,393","01:08:43,230","♪ But not too far,
or you'll be drowned"
1173,"01:08:43,232","01:08:45,465","They will come
in celebration."
1174,"01:08:45,467","01:08:48,971","And then, we will know
their size and strength."
1175,"01:08:50,639","01:08:54,074","As you have welcomed us,
we welcome you..."
1176,"01:08:54,076","01:08:56,545","our neighbors, our friends."
1177,"01:09:14,462","01:09:17,264","King Runeard, the dam isn't
strengthening our waters."
1178,"01:09:17,266","01:09:18,999",It's hurting the Forest.
1179,"01:09:19,001","01:09:20,400","It's cutting off
the North..."
1180,"01:09:20,402","01:09:22,236","Let... Let's not
discuss this here."
1181,"01:09:22,238","01:09:25,306","Let's meet on the fjord.
Have tea."
1182,"01:09:25,308","01:09:27,009",Find a solution.
1183,"01:09:38,620","01:09:39,421",No!
1184,"01:09:45,862","01:09:47,063",Anna!
1185,"01:09:56,172","01:10:00,875","Hmm. Which lucky tunnel
do we choose?"
1186,"01:10:00,877","01:10:03,476","You see, the dam
will weaken their lands,"
1187,"01:10:03,478","01:10:04,845","so they will
have to turn to me."
1188,"01:10:04,847","01:10:06,479","King Runeard, the dam,"
1189,"01:10:06,481","01:10:08,251",it's hurting the Forest.
1190,"01:10:13,256","01:10:15,022",Elsa's found it.
1191,"01:10:15,024","01:10:16,422",What is it?
1192,"01:10:16,424","01:10:18,426",The truth about the past.
1193,"01:10:19,394","01:10:21,561",That's my grandfather...
1194,"01:10:21,563","01:10:25,099","attacking
the Northuldra leader..."
1195,"01:10:25,101","01:10:27,703",who wields no weapon.
1196,"01:10:30,339","01:10:32,875","The dam wasn't
a gift of peace."
1197,"01:10:33,943","01:10:35,608",It was a trick.
1198,"01:10:35,610","01:10:37,344","But that goes
against everything"
1199,"01:10:37,346","01:10:38,781",Arendelle stands for.
1200,"01:10:39,382","01:10:40,883","It does, doesn't it?"
1201,"01:10:43,652","01:10:46,086","I know how to free
the Forest."
1202,"01:10:46,088","01:10:50,490","I know what we have to do
to set things right."
1203,"01:10:50,492","01:10:52,695","Why do you say that
so sadly?"
1204,"01:10:53,461","01:10:55,329",We have to break the dam.
1205,"01:10:55,331","01:10:57,865","But Arendelle
will be flooded."
1206,"01:10:57,867","01:11:00,768","That's why everyone
was forced out."
1207,"01:11:00,770","01:11:03,873","To protect them
from what has to be done."
1208,"01:11:04,206","01:11:06,042",Oh. Oh!
1209,"01:11:09,178","01:11:10,744",Are you okay?
1210,"01:11:10,746","01:11:13,115","I could really use
a bright side, Olaf."
1211,"01:11:13,883","01:11:15,950",Bright side? Um...
1212,"01:11:15,952","01:11:18,686","Turtles can breathe
through their butts."
1213,"01:11:18,688","01:11:22,024","- Huh?
- And I see a way out."
1214,"01:11:23,525","01:11:25,593","I knew I could
count on you."
1215,"01:11:29,932","01:11:33,499","Come on, Olaf, Elsa's probably
on her way back right now."
1216,"01:11:33,501","01:11:34,870",We can meet her and...
1217,"01:11:37,039","01:11:38,040",Olaf?
1218,"01:11:38,975","01:11:40,109",What's this?
1219,"01:11:40,542","01:11:42,109",Are you okay?
1220,"01:11:42,111","01:11:44,178",I'm flurrying?
1221,"01:11:44,180","01:11:45,312",Wait. No. That's...
1222,"01:11:45,314","01:11:47,016",That's not it.
1223,"01:11:48,351","01:11:52,086",I'm flurrying away.
1224,"01:11:52,088","01:11:55,422",The magic in me is fading.
1225,"01:11:55,424","01:11:56,624",What?
1226,"01:11:58,593","01:12:00,694",I don't think Elsa's okay.
1227,"01:12:00,696","01:12:03,065",I think...
1228,"01:12:04,133","01:12:06,268",she may have gone too far.
1229,"01:12:07,470","01:12:10,037",No. No.
1230,"01:12:10,039","01:12:11,107",Anna?
1231,"01:12:11,539","01:12:13,674",I'm sorry.
1232,"01:12:13,676","01:12:17,077","You're gonna have to do
this next part on your own."
1233,"01:12:17,079","01:12:18,578","- Okay?
- Wait."
1234,"01:12:18,580","01:12:20,314",Come here.
1235,"01:12:20,316","01:12:22,617","- I've got you.
- Oh."
1236,"01:12:23,085","01:12:24,586",That's good.
1237,"01:12:26,288","01:12:28,122","Hey, Anna?"
1238,"01:12:28,124","01:12:31,291","I just thought of one thing
that's permanent."
1239,"01:12:31,293","01:12:32,627",What's that?
1240,"01:12:33,229","01:12:34,864",Love.
1241,"01:12:36,098","01:12:37,266",Warm hugs?
1242,"01:12:40,770","01:12:43,906",I like warm hugs.
1243,"01:12:52,915","01:12:54,717",I love you.
1244,"01:14:00,648","01:14:03,252",Olaf? Elsa?
1245,"01:14:04,787","01:14:07,156",What do I do now?

1300,"01:18:42,531","01:18:44,431",What?
1301,"01:18:44,433","01:18:47,002","No, no, no, no.
She's leading them to the dam."
1302,"01:18:57,346","01:18:58,345",Kristoff!
1303,"01:18:58,347","01:18:59,980","I'm here.
What do you need?"
1304,"01:18:59,982","01:19:01,515","- To get to the dam.
- You got it."
1305,"01:19:01,517","01:19:02,518",Thank you.
1306,"01:19:18,667","01:19:20,400",Come on. Come on.

1309,"01:19:28,010","01:19:30,577","Your Highness,
what are you doing?"
1310,"01:19:30,579","01:19:31,978",The dam must fall.
1311,"01:19:31,980","01:19:34,581","It's the only way to break
the mist and free the Forest."
1312,"01:19:34,583","01:19:37,350","But we've sworn to protect
Arendelle at all costs."
1313,"01:19:37,352","01:19:40,822","Arendelle has no future
until we make this right."
1314,"01:19:40,824","01:19:42,958","King Runeard
betrayed everyone."
1315,"01:19:44,159","01:19:45,525",How do you know that?
1316,"01:19:45,527","01:19:48,197","My sister gave her life
for the truth."
1317,"01:19:50,733","01:19:52,098",Please.
1318,"01:19:52,100","01:19:54,136","Before we lose
anyone else."
1319,"01:20:16,425","01:20:17,459",Look out!
1320,"01:20:24,834","01:20:26,934","Destroy the dam!
Come on!"
1321,"01:20:26,936","01:20:28,470",Throw your boulders.
1322,"01:20:33,710","01:20:34,777",That's it.
1323,"01:20:52,160","01:20:53,997","- I've got her!
- Anna!"
1324,"01:20:54,563","01:20:55,832",Hang on!
1325,"01:23:15,203","01:23:17,805","I'm sorry
I left you behind."
1326,"01:23:17,807","01:23:20,775","I was just so desperate
to protect her."
1327,"01:23:20,777","01:23:23,911","I know. I know.
It's okay."
1328,"01:23:23,913","01:23:25,580",My love is not fragile.
1329,"01:23:27,382","01:23:28,550",Wow.
1330,"01:23:29,251","01:23:31,486",Look at the sky.
1331,"01:23:33,355","01:23:36,023","I just didn't realize
there was so much of it."
1332,"01:23:36,025","01:23:38,059",34 years...
1333,"01:23:38,061","01:23:39,626",Five months...
1334,"01:23:39,628","01:23:42,330",And 23 days.
1335,"01:24:53,136","01:24:55,002",Is it really you?
1336,"01:24:55,004","01:24:56,939",Anna.
1337,"01:24:58,808","01:25:00,875",I thought I'd lost you.
1338,"01:25:00,877","01:25:02,275",Lost me?
1339,"01:25:02,277","01:25:05,045",You saved me. Again.
1340,"01:25:05,047","01:25:06,180",I did?
1341,"01:25:06,182","01:25:09,018","And, Anna,
Arendelle did not fall."
1342,"01:25:11,053","01:25:12,452",It didn't?
1343,"01:25:12,454","01:25:14,722",The spirits all agreed.
1344,"01:25:14,724","01:25:17,727","Arendelle deserves
to stand with you."
1345,"01:25:19,195","01:25:20,326",Me?
1346,"01:25:20,328","01:25:23,396","You did what was right.
For everyone."
1347,"01:25:23,398","01:25:25,467","Did you find
the fifth spirit?"
1348,"01:25:27,435","01:25:30,039","You are
the fifth spirit."
1349,"01:25:30,706","01:25:31,906",You're the bridge.
1350,"01:25:31,908","01:25:34,641","Well, actually,
a bridge has two sides."
1351,"01:25:34,643","01:25:37,945","And Mother had
two daughters."
1352,"01:25:37,947","01:25:40,147",We did this together.
1353,"01:25:40,149","01:25:42,852","And we'll continue
