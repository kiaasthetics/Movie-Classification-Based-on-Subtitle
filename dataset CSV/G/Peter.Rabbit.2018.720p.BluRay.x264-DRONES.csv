13,"00:01:16,602","00:01:19,334","That's not the story
we're telling."
14,"00:01:19,336","00:01:23,171","No. We're here
for Peter Rabbit."
15,"00:01:23,173","00:01:25,040",The hero of our tale.
16,"00:01:26,210","00:01:29,682","A young rabbit in a blue coat
and no pants."
17,"00:01:34,786","00:01:37,253","Hey! Pick on someone
your own size."
18,"00:01:37,255","00:01:38,321",My pleasure.
19,"00:01:38,323","00:01:39,759",Oh! I didn't mean me.
20,"00:01:43,094","00:01:44,193",Ow!
21,"00:01:51,169","00:01:53,804","Going into his
garden again, I see."
22,"00:01:53,806","00:01:56,807","There are safer ways
to get a meal, you know!"
23,"00:01:56,809","00:01:58,239","Yeah, but they're not as fun."
24,"00:01:59,812","00:02:00,945",Oi.
25,"00:02:00,947","00:02:03,378","What did I tell you about
sneakin' into McGregor's?"
26,"00:02:03,380","00:02:05,615","Make sure to
get you some cauliflower?"
27,"00:02:05,617","00:02:07,151","That's a good boy.
Now, off you get."
28,"00:02:10,187","00:02:11,987","All right,
talk to me, Benjamin."
29,"00:02:11,989","00:02:12,889","He's mowed half the lawn,"
30,"00:02:12,891","00:02:14,827","which maybe gives us
just enough time."
31,"00:02:15,627","00:02:16,827",Look at him.
32,"00:02:16,829","00:02:18,094",Pure evil.
33,"00:02:18,096","00:02:20,095",Even cuts grass angry.
34,"00:02:20,097","00:02:21,330","Hey, here's a crazy thought."
35,"00:02:21,332","00:02:22,865","What if we don't go in,"
36,"00:02:22,867","00:02:24,967","because last time,
you almost got caught."
37,"00:02:24,969","00:02:26,235",You're so adorable.
38,"00:02:26,237","00:02:27,202",I could just eat you up.
39,"00:02:27,204","00:02:29,841","That's exactly what
he wants to do to you."
40,"00:02:31,676","00:02:33,175",Higher. Higher.
41,"00:02:33,177","00:02:36,045",Why are you always on top?
42,"00:02:36,047","00:02:37,245",Because I'm the oldest.
43,"00:02:37,247","00:02:39,015",We're triplets!
44,"00:02:39,017","00:02:40,416",I'm still the oldest.
45,"00:02:40,418","00:02:43,386",By 16 seconds.
46,"00:02:43,388","00:02:46,154","Ugh. When's the last time
you brushed your tail?"
47,"00:02:46,156","00:02:47,823",Whoa!
48,"00:02:47,825","00:02:49,325","All right, rest time's over.
Come on."
49,"00:02:49,327","00:02:50,392","- Yeah.
- Race you."
50,"00:02:50,394","00:02:52,394",Not if I race you first.
51,"00:02:52,396","00:02:53,829",No fair.
52,"00:03:03,407","00:03:04,239",Take it all in
53,"00:03:04,241","00:03:08,177","because we're about
to take it all in."
54,"00:03:08,179","00:03:11,446","Sorry. I don't know
why I'm so out of shape."
55,"00:03:11,448","00:03:12,882",I only eat salad.
56,"00:03:12,884","00:03:14,885","It's the dressing.
Get it on the side."
57,"00:03:14,887","00:03:16,351","Or just have
a drizzle of lemon."
58,"00:03:16,353","00:03:18,154","It'll change your life,
trust me."
59,"00:03:18,156","00:03:19,790",Right. You all know the drill.
60,"00:03:19,792","00:03:21,725","I'm not gonna pretend
that what we're about to do"
61,"00:03:21,727","00:03:24,292","isn't reckless, foolhardy,
even dangerous."
62,"00:03:24,294","00:03:25,427","But we will succeed,"
63,"00:03:25,429","00:03:27,798","because each of us
plays a vital role"
64,"00:03:27,800","00:03:30,965","specifically tailored
to our individual talents."
65,"00:03:30,967","00:03:33,168","Lookout. Lookout.
Lookout. Lookout."
66,"00:03:33,170","00:03:34,202",Hero.
67,"00:03:34,204","00:03:35,337",Hmm.
68,"00:03:35,339","00:03:36,439",Now let's do this.
69,"00:03:36,441","00:03:37,874",Right behind ya.
70,"00:03:37,876","00:03:39,007","- Not a chance.
- Why?"
71,"00:03:39,009","00:03:41,177","Are you afraid I'm gonna get
my foot caught in a trap"
72,"00:03:41,179","00:03:43,244","and I'll have to gnaw it off, and
then you'll call me ""Stumpy"""
73,"00:03:43,246","00:03:45,916","for the rest of my life, and
I'll have a horrifying scar,"
74,"00:03:45,918","00:03:48,920","but all the real scars
will be on the inside?"
75,"00:03:50,823","00:03:52,053",Sorry you had to hear that.
76,"00:03:52,055","00:03:54,189","It's okay. We're family.
This is a safe space."
77,"00:03:54,191","00:03:56,092","All right, bring it in."
78,"00:03:56,094","00:03:57,358","- We all ready?
- Yep."
79,"00:03:57,360","00:03:58,862","- Absolutely.
- Always."
80,"00:03:58,864","00:04:00,733","- I guess.
- Love you guys."
81,"00:04:01,332","00:04:02,669","Now, let's do this."
82,"00:04:03,201","00:04:04,433",It's gonna be a fun one.
83,"00:04:23,488","00:04:26,254","Lettuce, radishes, radicchio."
84,"00:04:26,256","00:04:28,223","I'll tell you
what's ""radicchio."""
85,"00:04:28,225","00:04:31,393","How easy it is to steal
this man's vegetables."
86,"00:04:31,395","00:04:35,263","Because ""radicchio""
sounds like ""ridiculous."""
87,"00:04:35,265","00:04:36,967",Don't explain the joke.
88,"00:04:40,104","00:04:41,437","- Flopsy!
- Yeah!"
89,"00:04:41,439","00:04:43,071",Mopsy!
90,"00:04:43,073","00:04:44,076",Cotton-Tail!
91,"00:04:45,242","00:04:46,778",Oh.
92,"00:04:47,545","00:04:48,915",I'm good!
93,"00:04:54,285","00:04:56,184","Tomayto, tomahto."
94,"00:04:56,186","00:04:57,987","Potayto, potahto."
95,"00:04:57,989","00:05:00,556","No one actually says ""potahto,""
have you noticed that?"
96,"00:05:00,558","00:05:02,023",Stop messing around.
97,"00:05:02,025","00:05:03,124",I can mess around all I want.
98,"00:05:03,126","00:05:05,326","He can't hear us
over the lawn..."
99,"00:05:07,131","00:05:08,263",Mower.
100,"00:05:15,507","00:05:16,539",Rabbits.
101,"00:05:31,456","00:05:32,825","No, no, stop."
102,"00:05:51,275","00:05:52,307","- Leave.
- Scram."
103,"00:05:52,309","00:05:53,310",Get out of there.
104,"00:06:03,555","00:06:04,924",Hmm.
105,"00:06:07,459","00:06:08,625","Peter, no."
106,"00:06:08,627","00:06:10,158","- I'm gonna put this in there.
- Don't do that."
107,"00:06:10,160","00:06:12,628","- You think this is a bad idea?
- Yes, it's a bad idea."
108,"00:06:12,630","00:06:14,598","I'm getting mixed signals.
Yes or no?"
109,"00:06:14,600","00:06:15,533",It's a definite no.
110,"00:06:15,535","00:06:17,500","I can't see your
mouth through the gate."
111,"00:06:17,502","00:06:19,635",No. No. No. No.
112,"00:06:19,637","00:06:21,002","- I think you said yes.
- No."
113,"00:06:21,004","00:06:23,505","- I'm going with ""yes.""
- No, no, Peter."
114,"00:06:23,507","00:06:25,273","- What?
- Oh, God."
115,"00:06:25,275","00:06:26,277","Oh, no."
116,"00:06:26,612","00:06:27,979",No.
117,"00:06:28,378","00:06:30,647",Peter. No!
118,"00:06:38,656","00:06:40,827","- Get out of there.
- Ooh."
119,"00:06:41,560","00:06:44,960","Rabbit, I'm gonna
put you in a pie."
120,"00:06:44,962","00:06:46,295",Leave the jacket.
121,"00:06:46,297","00:06:48,099",Like I did your dad.
122,"00:06:54,639","00:06:56,940","Morning, Mr. McGregor."
123,"00:06:56,942","00:06:58,107","Oh, it's you."
124,"00:06:58,109","00:06:59,975","Beautiful day, isn't it?"
125,"00:06:59,977","00:07:01,110",Give me that rabbit.
126,"00:07:01,112","00:07:03,080","You got a little
something in your..."
127,"00:07:05,683","00:07:07,052",You're okay.
128,"00:07:09,488","00:07:10,857",Are you okay?
129,"00:07:11,690","00:07:13,187",Did he just wink?
130,"00:07:13,189","00:07:15,491","I didn't even know
we could do that."
131,"00:07:15,493","00:07:16,992",You look very well.
132,"00:07:16,994","00:07:19,127","That vein that's usually bulging out
of your head's really calmed down."
133,"00:07:19,129","00:07:20,362",Have you been meditating?
134,"00:07:20,364","00:07:22,468",This is my garden.
135,"00:07:23,366","00:07:25,033",Let me pass that along.
136,"00:07:25,035","00:07:28,336",This is his garden.
137,"00:07:28,338","00:07:29,972",There we are.
138,"00:07:29,974","00:07:31,172","I think we're
all on the same page."
139,"00:07:31,174","00:07:32,975","So these rabbits
will now surrender"
140,"00:07:32,977","00:07:35,945","their natural instinct
to feed themselves."
141,"00:07:35,947","00:07:39,047",Next time will be their last.
142,"00:07:39,049","00:07:41,285","I'll be sure to
pass that along, too."
143,"00:07:43,287","00:07:45,090","Oh. Come on, sweeties."
144,"00:07:46,090","00:07:46,989",Come on.
145,"00:07:46,991","00:07:48,558",This is Bea.
146,"00:07:48,560","00:07:52,026","She's next-door neighbor to Mr.
McGregor and the rabbits."
147,"00:07:52,028","00:07:53,429","Guess which one
she likes better?"
148,"00:07:53,431","00:07:56,198","Inside. Come on. I'll get
you something to drink."
149,"00:07:56,200","00:07:58,033",You must stop going in there.
150,"00:07:58,035","00:07:59,906","You almost
got caught this time."
151,"00:08:00,338","00:08:01,671","Come here, little one."
152,"00:08:01,673","00:08:03,439",Dry you off.
153,"00:08:03,441","00:08:04,808",She's an artist.
154,"00:08:04,810","00:08:07,476","She moved out to the country
to work on her paintings."
155,"00:08:07,478","00:08:11,613","Oh, don't feel bad if you don't
understand them, like them,"
156,"00:08:11,615","00:08:13,381","even know which way to
look at them."
157,"00:08:13,383","00:08:16,486","They are terrible
and she knows it."
158,"00:08:16,488","00:08:19,458","So for fun, she's been painting
portraits of the locals."
159,"00:08:20,558","00:08:21,591",Beautiful.
160,"00:08:21,593","00:08:23,391",But a constant reminder
161,"00:08:23,393","00:08:26,131","of what Peter and his family
had gone through."
162,"00:09:33,163","00:09:36,397","I promise I'll always
be here for you."
163,"00:09:36,399","00:09:37,533","And she has,"
164,"00:09:37,535","00:09:39,471",ever since their mother died.
165,"00:09:42,339","00:09:43,340",Oh.
166,"00:09:43,774","00:09:45,275",The rain stopped.
167,"00:09:47,711","00:09:49,646",Sorry about Dad's jacket.
168,"00:09:49,648","00:09:51,714","I'm sorry you
lost Dad's jacket."
169,"00:09:51,716","00:09:52,815",I just said that.
170,"00:09:52,817","00:09:54,415","Yeah, but coming
from the oldest,"
171,"00:09:54,417","00:09:56,853",it just kind of means more.
172,"00:09:56,855","00:09:58,252",Just a jacket.
173,"00:09:58,254","00:09:59,789",Dad and Mum are still in here.
174,"00:09:59,791","00:10:03,324","And here. And here.
And here. And here."
175,"00:10:03,326","00:10:05,260","But less so with you,
since you're just a cousin,"
176,"00:10:05,262","00:10:07,195","you know. You're a nephew,
and by marriage."
177,"00:10:07,197","00:10:08,665","I'm not taking
anything away, I'm just..."
178,"00:10:08,667","00:10:10,467","You know,
I want to be accurate."
179,"00:10:10,469","00:10:13,506","Okay, just promise me
you'll stay out of the garden."
180,"00:10:49,875","00:10:51,308","Got it back, Dad."
181,"00:10:57,548","00:10:58,650","Got you, rabbit."
182,"00:10:59,884","00:11:01,751",I knew you'd come.
183,"00:11:03,220","00:11:06,224","The lady's not here
to protect you now."
184,"00:11:12,563","00:11:16,100","I've got a hankering
for pie tonight."
185,"00:11:16,668","00:11:18,504",Rabbit pie.
186,"00:11:26,811","00:11:28,179",Huh?
187,"00:11:30,649","00:11:31,649",What?
188,"00:11:37,855","00:11:39,224",What?
189,"00:11:41,425","00:11:42,427",Whoa.
190,"00:11:42,693","00:11:43,792",Is he...
191,"00:11:45,629","00:11:47,364",That's pretty conclusive.
192,"00:11:48,398","00:11:49,932",Very conclusive.
193,"00:11:49,934","00:11:52,302",That means that... That I...
194,"00:11:52,703","00:11:53,802",That I...
195,"00:11:53,804","00:11:55,671",That I did it. I did it.

389,"00:19:45,141","00:19:46,407",Left. Right.
390,"00:19:46,409","00:19:47,745",Perfect.
391,"00:19:48,812","00:19:50,147","He's gone now, guys."
392,"00:19:51,683","00:19:53,619","I just wish
you were here to enjoy it."
393,"00:19:55,351","00:19:57,788","I'm never letting anyone
take it from us again."
394,"00:20:13,771","00:20:15,036",Thomas McGregor?
395,"00:20:15,038","00:20:16,705","Sign here, please."
396,"00:20:16,707","00:20:19,007","Oh, from Windermere?
Fancy place, that."
397,"00:20:19,009","00:20:20,710","I don't know anyone from
Windermere."
398,"00:20:20,712","00:20:22,010","Well, it's from
Unclaimed Property."
399,"00:20:22,012","00:20:24,011","Usually means
you've inherited something."
400,"00:20:24,013","00:20:26,414","Inherited
something, he did."
401,"00:20:26,416","00:20:28,818","From that great-uncle
he knew nothing about."
402,"00:20:28,820","00:20:31,319","Turns out intimacy issues
run in the family."
403,"00:20:31,321","00:20:33,789","Windermere?
That's in the country."
404,"00:20:33,791","00:20:34,724","Well, fancy country."
405,"00:20:34,726","00:20:36,895","The houses there
go for a king's ransom."
406,"00:20:37,861","00:20:40,127","Ransom enough to
buy my own toy shop?"
407,"00:20:40,129","00:20:41,062",I'd imagine so.
408,"00:20:41,064","00:20:42,230","And fill it with the finest
merchandise?"
409,"00:20:42,232","00:20:43,197","Should do, yeah."
410,"00:20:43,199","00:20:44,733","Ransom enough to have
tempered glass shelving"
411,"00:20:44,735","00:20:45,769","and seasonal
window decorations?"
412,"00:20:45,771","00:20:48,368","That I might have to do
some research on, sir."
413,"00:20:48,370","00:20:50,174","Can I get back to you
mail-time tomorrow?"
414,"00:20:57,313","00:20:59,313","Round trip to Windermere,
please."
415,"00:20:59,315","00:21:00,415","- Here you go.
- Thank you."
416,"00:21:00,417","00:21:03,952","♪ I don't give a damn
what the people say"
417,"00:21:03,954","00:21:06,221","♪ I'm gonna do it my way,
gonna do it my way"
418,"00:21:06,223","00:21:08,088","♪ Boom, boom, boom, boom,
and bang, bang, bang"
419,"00:21:08,090","00:21:10,125","♪ I'm gonna let it all out,
do my thing"
420,"00:21:10,127","00:21:12,528","♪ Boom, boom, boom,
and a bang, bang, bang ♪"
421,"00:21:12,530","00:21:14,361","Good evening. Are you
aware of this location?"
422,"00:21:14,363","00:21:15,865","- The McGregor manor?
- Yes."
423,"00:21:15,867","00:21:17,232","- Is that where you're staying?
- It's just temporary."
424,"00:21:17,234","00:21:18,833","I am merely appraising
the manor's condition"
425,"00:21:18,835","00:21:20,502","before putting it
on the market to sell."
426,"00:21:20,504","00:21:22,841","But you do want me
to take you there?"
427,"00:21:23,072","00:21:23,972",Yes.
428,"00:21:23,974","00:21:25,007","- Well, hop in.
- Thank you."
429,"00:21:25,009","00:21:26,876","I think you're really going
to love living there."
430,"00:21:26,878","00:21:28,376","Please don't talk to me
on the drive."
431,"00:21:29,411","00:21:31,146","- Give it to me.
- Here."
432,"00:21:34,984","00:21:37,855",I can fly! Oh!
433,"00:21:39,321","00:21:40,822",I think I cracked a rib.
434,"00:21:40,824","00:21:42,190",How many ribs do we have?
435,"00:21:42,192","00:21:44,058","- Thirteen.
- No way."
436,"00:21:44,060","00:21:45,193",Sweet.
437,"00:21:45,195","00:21:46,529","Oh, no, but don't..."
438,"00:21:46,531","00:21:48,032",I can fly...
439,"00:21:49,232","00:21:50,666",Oh.
440,"00:21:50,668","00:21:53,001","It's nothing against the country.
I just find it disgusting."
441,"00:21:53,003","00:21:55,270","Yes, you've made that
quite clear on the journey, sir."
442,"00:21:55,272","00:21:57,137","I would just like
the record to reflect that."
443,"00:21:57,139","00:22:00,140","Well, I shall create a record
and make sure that it reflects it."
444,"00:22:00,142","00:22:02,443",A human.
445,"00:22:02,445","00:22:05,146","Oh, dear. Everybody out! Out!"
446,"00:22:05,148","00:22:08,818","Get out! Humans are coming!
Human! Human!"
447,"00:22:08,820","00:22:11,386","You know, it's like, who am I?"
448,"00:22:11,388","00:22:13,489",Who are you? Yeah?
449,"00:22:13,491","00:22:16,457","You know, like,
we're all connected,"
450,"00:22:16,459","00:22:17,961",but with what rope?
451,"00:22:20,030","00:22:22,396",A human! Humans are coming!
452,"00:22:22,398","00:22:23,935","- What should we do?
- What?"
453,"00:22:24,901","00:22:26,467",Everybody hide!
454,"00:22:31,340","00:22:33,974","Oh, your quills
are stabbing me."
455,"00:22:33,976","00:22:35,856",I wasn't designed for hiding.
456,"00:22:45,155","00:22:47,324",Who lives like this?
457,"00:22:49,325","00:22:51,091",Hit the lights!
458,"00:22:51,093","00:22:52,797","Oh, no. Tommy!"
459,"00:22:53,163","00:22:54,864","Tommy, hide!"
460,"00:22:58,502","00:23:01,135","No, just because
you can't see him,"
461,"00:23:01,137","00:23:03,504","doesn't mean he can't
see you. Understand?"
462,"00:23:03,506","00:23:05,811","- Mmm-hmm.
- Now hide!"
463,"00:23:06,309","00:23:07,175","What? No, Tommy."
464,"00:23:07,177","00:23:10,310","Now you're just
posing as a candelabra."
465,"00:23:10,312","00:23:12,246",Now you're just a tablecloth.
466,"00:23:12,248","00:23:13,514",Now you're just a...
467,"00:23:13,516","00:23:15,183",What are you?
468,"00:23:15,185","00:23:17,151",I'm a lazy Susan.
469,"00:23:17,153","00:23:18,155",What?
470,"00:23:21,190","00:23:22,425",Tommy! Tommy!
471,"00:24:00,697","00:24:02,265",Get... Get out!
472,"00:24:05,535","00:24:06,904",Get...
473,"00:24:08,437","00:24:09,971",Get out!
474,"00:24:09,973","00:24:14,177","Every single one of you!
Out, you vermin!"
475,"00:24:18,716","00:24:20,648",Stay out of my house!
476,"00:24:20,650","00:24:22,349",He had the key.
477,"00:24:22,351","00:24:24,520",He must be a McGregor.
478,"00:24:24,522","00:24:25,990",Oh.
479,"00:24:27,491","00:24:29,290",Headlights.
480,"00:24:29,292","00:24:32,292","Felix, blink.
Blink, blink, blink, blink."
481,"00:24:32,294","00:24:33,729","Come on, big guy.
Blink, blink, blink."
482,"00:24:33,731","00:24:36,030",Headlights.
483,"00:24:36,032","00:24:37,472","Come on, deer."
484,"00:24:45,308","00:24:47,075",The sun came up again?
485,"00:24:47,077","00:24:48,342",I can't believe it!
486,"00:24:48,344","00:24:50,979","I thought when I closed
my eyes last night,"
487,"00:24:50,981","00:24:52,013",that that was it!
488,"00:24:52,015","00:24:56,384","But we have another day of this!
Whoo-hoo!"
489,"00:25:06,161","00:25:07,464",It wasn't a nightmare.
490,"00:25:11,001","00:25:12,537",Oh. It's a nightmare.
491,"00:25:37,561","00:25:39,494",What is that music?
492,"00:25:39,496","00:25:40,530",I don't know.
493,"00:25:40,532","00:25:44,065","But it sounds very dramatic
and life-changing."
494,"00:25:55,244","00:25:56,512",Oh.
495,"00:25:56,514","00:25:58,614","Hello, sweeties."
496,"00:25:58,616","00:26:00,682","You checking
on the new neighbor?"
497,"00:26:00,684","00:26:02,416","Don't worry.
He can't be any worse"
498,"00:26:02,418","00:26:04,988","than the old crab bucket,
rest his soul."
499,"00:26:06,055","00:26:08,523","Never know, maybe he'll be
a nice, normal man."
500,"00:26:08,525","00:26:09,526",He looks nice.
501,"00:26:10,126","00:26:11,392",Looks very normal.
502,"00:26:12,796","00:26:14,598","That's not very normal, is it?"
503,"00:26:15,666","00:26:16,764",That's normal.
504,"00:26:18,502","00:26:19,537",Hmm.
505,"00:26:20,603","00:26:22,369","Anyway,
it's gonna be exciting."
506,"00:26:22,371","00:26:24,371","We'll have somebody
new around here."
507,"00:26:24,373","00:26:26,574","They're not all bad,
I promise."
508,"00:26:26,576","00:26:27,810",I'll explain it to him.
509,"00:26:27,812","00:26:30,147","We all share
our land around here."
510,"00:26:33,248","00:26:35,151","I'm gonna give him the benefit
of the doubt."
511,"00:26:38,688","00:26:39,788","Oh, no."
512,"00:26:39,790","00:26:42,359","It's not over. We can
always go in the back..."
513,"00:26:43,460","00:26:44,525",Or through the...
514,"00:26:44,527","00:26:45,529",Or use the...
515,"00:26:45,862","00:26:47,360",Or behind the...
516,"00:26:47,362","00:26:48,830","I didn't even know
that was a way in."
517,"00:26:48,832","00:26:51,466","I see the gates
are back up, huh?"
518,"00:26:51,468","00:26:54,367","I guess you weren't
the prodigal son after all."
519,"00:26:54,369","00:26:56,839","That'll do, pig. That'll do."
520,"00:26:56,841","00:26:58,172","It was a fun night, though."
521,"00:26:58,174","00:27:00,676","I haven't eaten that much
in a long time."
522,"00:27:00,678","00:27:02,711",The diet starts now.
523,"00:27:04,313","00:27:05,314",Now.
524,"00:27:06,315","00:27:08,052","- Now.
- Hey, look."
525,"00:27:09,252","00:27:10,421",Now.
526,"00:27:11,186","00:27:12,521","Hello. Oh, sorry."
527,"00:27:12,523","00:27:15,756","I didn't mean to startle you. I'm Bea.
I just live over here."
528,"00:27:15,758","00:27:18,126",Oh. Hello. I'm Thomas.
529,"00:27:18,128","00:27:21,330","I live way over there
in London."
530,"00:27:22,331","00:27:23,332",That way.
531,"00:27:24,300","00:27:26,467","Yes. I'm just
here temporarily."
532,"00:27:26,469","00:27:28,301","I'm fixing up
this place to sell,"
533,"00:27:28,303","00:27:30,171","using the proceeds
to open my own toy store,"
534,"00:27:30,173","00:27:31,039",preferably near Harrods
535,"00:27:31,041","00:27:33,541","so they can witness
their own downfall."
536,"00:27:33,543","00:27:36,243","Oh, my. That's a lot
of information right there."
537,"00:27:36,245","00:27:37,310","- Sorry.
- Good for you"
538,"00:27:37,312","00:27:38,279","for not being
afraid to open up."
539,"00:27:38,281","00:27:40,682","- What are they saying?
- Shh, I can read lips."
540,"00:27:40,684","00:27:42,415","I'm just a little
out of my element."
541,"00:27:42,417","00:27:44,653","I think you'll find the elements
here are pretty fabulous."
542,"00:27:44,655","00:27:47,622","""I think you'll find
the elephants around here"
543,"00:27:47,624","00:27:49,560","""are really flatulent."""
544,"00:27:49,860","00:27:51,091",What?
545,"00:27:51,093","00:27:54,361","In my opinion, it's just the
most beautiful place on Earth."
546,"00:27:54,363","00:27:56,633","Well, it just got
a lot more beautiful."
547,"00:27:57,534","00:27:59,102","Oh, gee."
548,"00:27:59,637","00:28:01,368",You didn't just say that.
549,"00:28:01,370","00:28:04,108","And clean, sturdy, functional."
550,"00:28:04,542","00:28:06,374","Oh, the gate."
551,"00:28:06,376","00:28:08,877","- Yes.
- I thought you were saying"
552,"00:28:08,879","00:28:10,411","- I was beautiful.
- Did you..."
553,"00:28:10,413","00:28:12,714","No, no, no. No,
I wouldn't say that."
554,"00:28:12,716","00:28:13,849",I wouldn't say that.
555,"00:28:13,851","00:28:16,349","- I would say that. I'm not...
- No, hey, I'm not fishing."
556,"00:28:16,351","00:28:17,819","- It's fine.
- You are beautiful."
557,"00:28:17,821","00:28:19,388","And you're different
to the gate."
558,"00:28:20,925","00:28:23,524","I can't read lips,
but I know her,"
559,"00:28:23,526","00:28:25,694","and she's telling him
to take down those gates,"
560,"00:28:25,696","00:28:26,928",and let us into the garden.
561,"00:28:26,930","00:28:29,230","Well, enjoy your brief stay."
562,"00:28:29,232","00:28:31,934","Just, please, don't be
like the nasty old man"
563,"00:28:31,936","00:28:33,868","who used to live here.
He was a real twit."
564,"00:28:33,870","00:28:35,736","- He was my uncle.
- You didn't let me finish."
565,"00:28:35,738","00:28:37,140",He was a real...
566,"00:28:39,677","00:28:41,643","Sorry, I can't..."
567,"00:28:41,645","00:28:44,780","No. There's no saving that one.
He was a real twit."
568,"00:28:44,782","00:28:45,848","- No offense.
- None taken."
569,"00:28:45,850","00:28:48,553","- I never knew him.
- You seem much more reasonable."
570,"00:28:48,785","00:28:49,918",Do I?
571,"00:28:49,920","00:28:52,920","Although, I must say, these
gates are incredibly sturdy."
572,"00:28:52,922","00:28:54,989","Are you expecting
an alien invasion?"
573,"00:28:54,991","00:28:58,259","I just need to keep the
wildlife out where they belong."
574,"00:28:58,261","00:29:00,494","Well, they actually belong
everywhere."
575,"00:29:00,496","00:29:02,763","It was kind of their place
first. We're the latecomers."
576,"00:29:02,765","00:29:03,732","How long does it take to say,"
577,"00:29:03,734","00:29:06,434","""Leave the gate open,
and let in the rabbits""?"
578,"00:29:06,436","00:29:09,302","Leave the gate
open, and let in the rabbits."
579,"00:29:09,304","00:29:10,404","Ah, I certainly will, madam."
580,"00:29:10,406","00:29:12,840","And might I say, those rabbits
are incredibly cute."
581,"00:29:12,842","00:29:15,711","Especially the one
with the blue coat. He's my favorite."
582,"00:29:15,713","00:29:16,978","And, oh, here's a present."
583,"00:29:16,980","00:29:19,449","Wait. Why is she
bringing him a present?"
584,"00:29:19,816","00:29:21,184",Oh.
585,"00:29:21,517","00:29:22,650",How nice of you.
586,"00:29:22,652","00:29:24,187",It's for bird-watching.
587,"00:29:25,420","00:29:26,422",Thank you.
588,"00:29:28,492","00:29:30,524",There's one. It has wings.
589,"00:29:30,526","00:29:32,527","Yes, that's a pretty
defining feature"
590,"00:29:32,529","00:29:34,395","of the bird,
I think you'll find."
591,"00:29:34,397","00:29:37,330","You spotted your first bird.
Make sure to mark it down later."
592,"00:29:37,332","00:29:38,699","- Mark it down?
- Mmm."
593,"00:29:38,701","00:29:42,305","So there's a way of organizing and
documenting the chaos of the sky?"
594,"00:29:42,473","00:29:43,370",Yes.
595,"00:29:43,372","00:29:45,610","Well, it was nice
to meet you, Thomas."
596,"00:29:45,975","00:29:47,343","Yes, you, too."
597,"00:29:48,646","00:29:51,378","And let's keep this
gate open, shall we,"
598,"00:29:51,380","00:29:53,446",so the wildlife can run free?
599,"00:29:53,448","00:29:55,316","- Absolutely.
- She did it."
600,"00:29:55,318","00:29:56,687",We're in. Come on.
601,"00:30:01,291","00:30:03,359","Maybe it's not so bad here,
after all."
602,"00:30:04,794","00:30:05,796",Ugh.
603,"00:30:11,768","00:30:13,367","- No.
- I don't care."
604,"00:30:13,369","00:30:15,336","- I'm going in.
- Right behind you."
605,"00:30:15,338","00:30:16,570",No. Not a chance.
606,"00:30:16,572","00:30:18,473","You remember what happened
to Dad, right?"
607,"00:30:18,475","00:30:19,808",But you go in all the time.
608,"00:30:19,810","00:30:21,075",That's my character flaw.
609,"00:30:21,077","00:30:22,677","You get your
own character flaw."
610,"00:30:22,679","00:30:24,945","- Come on, Benjamin.
- Why does he get to go?"
611,"00:30:24,947","00:30:26,881","Yeah, why do I have to go in?"
612,"00:30:26,883","00:30:28,483","Because that's
his character flaw."
613,"00:30:28,485","00:30:31,985","He goes along with everything I say, no
matter how stupid and reckless it is."
614,"00:30:31,987","00:30:34,422","No, I don't!
You're not the boss of me!"
615,"00:30:34,424","00:30:35,724","- Benjamin.
- Coming!"
616,"00:30:35,726","00:30:38,793","I can't let him go in by himself.
He's being stupid and reckless."
617,"00:30:40,496","00:30:42,329","I hope they're
going to be okay."
618,"00:30:42,331","00:30:44,465","They'll be fine, and if not,"
619,"00:30:44,467","00:30:47,502","I guess I'll just be
the new head of the family."
620,"00:30:47,504","00:30:50,672","Peter, please be okay!"
621,"00:30:54,578","00:30:56,677","I'm still
so out of shape."
622,"00:30:56,679","00:30:58,847","How's it working with the
putting the dressing on the side?"
623,"00:30:58,849","00:31:02,587","Good. But I don't understand why it's
healthier to drink it all at once."
624,"00:31:03,920","00:31:05,288",Disgusting.
625,"00:31:05,656","00:31:06,658",Come on.
626,"00:31:31,681","00:31:35,383","What'd I tell ya?
Easy peasy lemon squeezy."
627,"00:31:36,820","00:31:38,355","- Rats.
- Run!"
628,"00:31:56,438","00:31:57,908",Hello.
629,"00:31:59,442","00:32:01,879","This guy is so much faster
than the old one."
630,"00:32:03,914","00:32:04,949",Ah!
631,"00:32:13,423","00:32:15,155","Uh-oh. I think
we have a problem."
632,"00:32:15,157","00:32:17,626","- What is it?
- Everything's upside down."
633,"00:32:17,628","00:32:18,629",Where are you?
634,"00:32:20,464","00:32:21,995","We never should
have come in the garden."
635,"00:32:21,997","00:32:23,564","No guts, no glory."
636,"00:32:23,566","00:32:25,666","Are you ever
scared of anything?"
637,"00:32:25,668","00:32:27,502",Yeah. Dying alone.
638,"00:32:27,504","00:32:29,570",That's why I brought you here.
639,"00:32:29,572","00:32:32,509","Do you know what we do
with rats in the city?"
640,"00:32:33,576","00:32:37,647","We find them,
and we exterminate them."
641,"00:32:38,948","00:32:39,983",Ha!
642,"00:32:41,651","00:32:42,652",Benjamin.
643,"00:32:48,524","00:32:49,560",Ha!
644,"00:33:01,871","00:33:03,439",Ha!
645,"00:33:05,073","00:33:07,608","- Follow me.
- I can't see anything."
646,"00:33:07,610","00:33:10,144","- Follow my voice.
- I can't hear anything!"
647,"00:33:10,146","00:33:11,212",Follow your heart?
648,"00:33:11,214","00:33:12,647",What?
649,"00:33:13,583","00:33:14,751","That way, that way, that way."
650,"00:33:21,757","00:33:22,759",Play dead.
651,"00:33:34,003","00:33:36,136",This is what happens
652,"00:33:36,138","00:33:38,973","when you make
a McGregor look foolish"
653,"00:33:38,975","00:33:40,844","playing carnival games
in the shed."
654,"00:33:42,978","00:33:44,278","You see this, everyone?"
655,"00:33:44,280","00:33:46,818",This is what happens!
656,"00:33:47,551","00:33:49,983",Why am I talking to wildlife?
657,"00:33:49,985","00:33:51,852",I am losing my mind.
658,"00:33:51,854","00:33:54,056","I do... They're not
going to respond."
659,"00:34:00,996","00:34:01,997","Come on, come on!"
660,"00:34:07,969","00:34:08,971",Jump!
661,"00:34:39,302","00:34:41,301","Okay, okay.
Flopsy, take the bag,"
662,"00:34:41,303","00:34:43,672","go to the window
and you put it over his head."
663,"00:34:43,674","00:34:44,675",Okay.
664,"00:34:47,242","00:34:48,810","Mopsy, you take the bag,"
665,"00:34:48,812","00:34:50,977","go over to the window,
put it over his head."
666,"00:34:50,979","00:34:51,981",Got it.
667,"00:34:52,180","00:34:53,551",Oh.
668,"00:34:54,182","00:34:55,784","Cotton-Tail, take the bag..."
669,"00:34:57,654","00:34:59,590","- Just give him a wet willy.
- Got it."
670,"00:36:13,995","00:36:14,997",No!
671,"00:36:19,300","00:36:20,367","You okay, big guy?"
672,"00:36:20,369","00:36:22,002","Close one, huh?"
673,"00:36:22,004","00:36:22,904",I could've been killed.
674,"00:36:22,906","00:36:25,710","And not just me.
What if he got the girls?"
675,"00:36:26,374","00:36:27,944","This isn't a joke, Peter."
676,"00:36:28,276","00:36:29,647",I know.
677,"00:36:30,146","00:36:31,147",I'm sorry.
678,"00:36:32,981","00:36:34,815","You're all right though,
right?"
679,"00:36:34,817","00:36:36,283",I got your jacket back.
680,"00:36:36,285","00:36:37,951",It's not as symbolic as mine.
681,"00:36:37,953","00:36:39,285","You know, not being
your dad's and all."
682,"00:36:39,287","00:36:42,022","And it's brown, too, which is a
mistake because you're brown."
683,"00:36:42,024","00:36:43,757","I mean, brown on brown,
who wears that?"
684,"00:36:43,759","00:36:45,325",It's a bit matchy-matchy.
685,"00:36:45,327","00:36:48,127","Yeah, it's actually
a bit confusing."
686,"00:36:48,129","00:36:50,263","Half the time
we think you're naked."
687,"00:36:50,265","00:36:51,799",I just look for the buttons.
688,"00:36:51,801","00:36:54,167","But then one time,
it was your nipples."
689,"00:36:54,169","00:36:55,171",Huh?
690,"00:36:57,940","00:37:00,274","Anyway, you got it back,
and you're okay."
691,"00:37:00,276","00:37:02,911",No thanks to him. Look at him.
692,"00:37:02,913","00:37:05,178",Skinny bag of wet.
693,"00:37:05,180","00:37:07,884","Now, turn around
and drive us home, Eugene."
694,"00:37:08,249","00:37:09,951",Here's good.
695,"00:37:09,953","00:37:12,086","New to the area.
Probably take the next turn."
696,"00:37:12,088","00:37:14,120","Just using more fuel.
Not a surprise"
697,"00:37:14,122","00:37:16,055","that he's not
environmentally friendly."
698,"00:37:16,057","00:37:17,926","Hey, we don't
inherit the Earth,"
699,"00:37:17,928","00:37:20,728","we borrow it
from our children."
700,"00:37:20,730","00:37:23,330",I read that on a plastic cup.
701,"00:37:23,332","00:37:24,766",If you do a U-turn...
702,"00:37:24,768","00:37:26,900","It's actually a safe place
for a U-turn here."
703,"00:37:26,902","00:37:27,936",I think that's the...
704,"00:37:27,938","00:37:30,471","- Where...
- Where is he taking us?"
705,"00:37:30,473","00:37:33,307",He's taking us into town.
706,"00:37:33,309","00:37:36,944","- So this is London.
- Wow."
707,"00:37:36,946","00:37:38,746",Big Ben! Wow!
708,"00:37:38,748","00:37:40,082",It's gigantic.
709,"00:37:40,951","00:37:42,884","I hope you appreciate this,
Flopsy."
710,"00:37:42,886","00:37:45,051","I never got to travel
when I was your age."
711,"00:37:45,053","00:37:48,857","What? You were my age,
like, three streets ago."
712,"00:37:48,859","00:37:50,225",It goes so fast.
713,"00:37:55,064","00:37:56,363","- Huh?
- Whoa."
714,"00:37:56,365","00:37:58,064",This must be Harrods.
715,"00:37:58,066","00:37:59,870",Wow. Classy.
716,"00:38:01,471","00:38:02,503",What can I do for you?
717,"00:38:02,505","00:38:04,203",I have a vermin problem.
718,"00:38:04,205","00:38:05,507","Rabbits, I'm guessing."
719,"00:38:05,509","00:38:07,441","- How do you know that?
- You're the new McGregor."
720,"00:38:07,443","00:38:09,343","- Bea's neighbor.
- How do you know that?"
721,"00:38:09,345","00:38:10,980","- She mentioned you.
- She did?"
722,"00:38:11,514","00:38:12,514",What did she say?
723,"00:38:12,516","00:38:14,281","That you want to sell
your house in a hurry"
724,"00:38:14,283","00:38:16,884","and use the profits
to open your own toy store,"
725,"00:38:16,886","00:38:18,151","preferably near Harrods,"
726,"00:38:18,153","00:38:20,319","so they can witness
their own downfall."
727,"00:38:20,321","00:38:23,525","That's incredibly specifically
accurate, and a little disappointing."
728,"00:38:23,527","00:38:25,292","Who do you think
these guys are?"
729,"00:38:25,294","00:38:26,561","They're wearing aprons,"
730,"00:38:26,563","00:38:28,529","so that could mean
only one thing."
731,"00:38:28,531","00:38:29,997","- They're hedgehogs.
- They're hedgehogs."
732,"00:38:29,999","00:38:31,399",Hmm.
733,"00:38:31,401","00:38:33,332","Just make sure she doesn't find out
you're launching them rabbits."
734,"00:38:33,334","00:38:35,135",She loves 'em. Like family.
735,"00:38:35,137","00:38:36,938","Read their lips, Mopsy."
736,"00:38:36,940","00:38:38,138","If I was a learned fellow,"
737,"00:38:38,140","00:38:40,439","I'd say she
anthropomorphizes 'em"
738,"00:38:40,441","00:38:42,877","in lieu of any genuine
human interaction."
739,"00:38:42,879","00:38:44,211",But he's not a learned fellow.
740,"00:38:44,213","00:38:46,379","Which is why I think she's just
got a thing for those rabbits."
741,"00:38:46,381","00:38:49,415","""Which is why I think she's just
got a thing for most man butts."""
742,"00:38:49,417","00:38:50,485",Huh?
743,"00:38:50,487","00:38:51,585",What would you suggest?
744,"00:38:51,587","00:38:53,255","An electric fence
will keep 'em out."
745,"00:38:54,189","00:38:55,191","To launch 'em,"
746,"00:38:55,957","00:38:57,156",you'll need some firepower.
747,"00:38:58,227","00:39:00,359","Firepower seems like...
I don't want to..."
748,"00:39:00,361","00:39:01,961",Get down.
749,"00:39:01,963","00:39:04,064",That's them! I knew it.
750,"00:39:04,066","00:39:06,165","Where are you?
I know you're in there."
751,"00:39:06,167","00:39:08,303",Come out! I saw you!
752,"00:39:12,307","00:39:14,106","Launch them.
I want to launch them."
753,"00:39:14,108","00:39:15,779",Right. Follow me.
754,"00:39:21,050","00:39:23,417","It's okay. I've got
11 more ribs."
755,"00:39:23,419","00:39:25,318","You actually have
13 on each side."
756,"00:39:25,320","00:39:26,287",What?
757,"00:39:26,289","00:39:27,922","Which is technically 26
because they go..."
758,"00:39:27,924","00:39:29,523","Oh, now you're down to 19."
759,"00:39:29,525","00:39:31,191","Again, you push this button."
760,"00:39:31,193","00:39:34,026","The signal will travel
through the air to this."
761,"00:39:34,028","00:39:35,394","This'll start the spark,"
762,"00:39:35,396","00:39:37,231","and anything
near it will explode."
763,"00:39:37,233","00:39:40,202","I do understand the fundamental
concepts of basic things."
764,"00:39:49,010","00:39:50,345",It's tricky. A little bit.
765,"00:39:51,580","00:39:52,949",Thank you.
766,"00:39:55,484","00:39:57,216",Thank you!
767,"00:39:57,218","00:39:58,285",Drive safe!
768,"00:39:59,623","00:40:00,755",Just match its speed.
769,"00:40:00,757","00:40:04,091","Our natural rabbits' pace
should be able to keep up."
770,"00:40:10,667","00:40:13,068","Do you know what?
That would never have worked."
771,"00:40:19,974","00:40:21,341","Watch it, boxhead!"
772,"00:40:21,343","00:40:24,144","Leave him alone, babe.
He's just a country bumpkin."
773,"00:40:24,146","00:40:25,078",Morons.
774,"00:40:25,080","00:40:27,381","""Country bumpkin""?
I'm not a country bumpkin."
775,"00:40:27,383","00:40:29,982","I'm from London,
which is where I'd like to..."
776,"00:40:29,984","00:40:31,421","- Thomas?
- Bea."
777,"00:40:33,354","00:40:34,924","- Hello.
- Hello."
778,"00:40:35,659","00:40:37,390","- How are you?
- I'm very well. You..."
779,"00:40:37,392","00:40:38,225",What are you doing here?
780,"00:40:38,227","00:40:41,297","Oh, just...
Just picking up some, um,"
781,"00:40:42,330","00:40:43,196",hardware.
782,"00:40:43,198","00:40:44,665","- It's lovely to see you.
- What?"
783,"00:40:44,667","00:40:46,534","- Can I offer you a lift?
- Why is she here?"
784,"00:40:46,536","00:40:48,636","Oh, no.
He's stealing her bike."
785,"00:40:48,638","00:40:51,370","That's all right. It's more
difficult than I thought it was."
786,"00:40:51,372","00:40:54,140","Oh, no. He's stealing her."
787,"00:40:54,142","00:40:55,376","Oh, no."
788,"00:40:55,378","00:40:58,278","She's going willingly and seems
to be enjoying his company."
789,"00:40:58,280","00:40:59,282","Come on, come on."
790,"00:41:04,621","00:41:05,989",Come on.
791,"00:41:12,394","00:41:15,028",That's a lot of smiling.
792,"00:41:15,030","00:41:16,430","More than before, even."
793,"00:41:16,432","00:41:18,031",She is showing more teeth.
794,"00:41:18,033","00:41:19,432",Must mean she likes him.
795,"00:41:19,434","00:41:20,701",Aw.
796,"00:41:20,703","00:41:22,169","Not ""aw."""
797,"00:41:22,171","00:41:24,706","She doesn't like him.
She's just really nice."
798,"00:41:24,708","00:41:27,207",She smiles at us all the time.
799,"00:41:27,209","00:41:28,378",Not like that.
800,"00:41:37,554","00:41:38,923",Come in.
801,"00:41:41,323","00:41:42,927","Would you like
something to drink?"
802,"00:41:43,325","00:41:44,327","Yes, please."
803,"00:41:45,327","00:41:46,329",Oh.
804,"00:41:47,162","00:41:48,394",Are these your paintings?
805,"00:41:48,396","00:41:51,164","Oh, that's just
a work in progress."
806,"00:41:51,166","00:41:53,369","No, no, this is,
this is beautiful."
807,"00:41:54,169","00:41:55,234",Thank you.
808,"00:41:55,236","00:41:57,505","What a majestic
mountain range."
809,"00:41:57,507","00:41:59,106",It's an old woman in a hat.
810,"00:41:59,108","00:42:01,107","Right. Yeah. There's...
There's the hat."
811,"00:42:01,109","00:42:02,710","- That's her eyes.
- Yes."
812,"00:42:02,712","00:42:04,377","- And that's her chin.
- It's her foot."
813,"00:42:04,379","00:42:05,381",That's her foot.
814,"00:42:06,716","00:42:09,616","Oh. I'm allergic to
blackberries."
815,"00:42:09,618","00:42:11,786","- Oh.
- I'm sorry. My throat closes up."
816,"00:42:11,788","00:42:14,321",Allergic to blackberries?
817,"00:42:14,323","00:42:16,323","Is that even a thing?
Is that where we've got to?"
818,"00:42:16,325","00:42:20,160","I mean, everyone's suddenly
allergic to everything."
819,"00:42:20,162","00:42:21,361",Stop using it as a crutch!
820,"00:42:21,363","00:42:24,430","You know, some people do have
legitimate medical conditions."
821,"00:42:24,432","00:42:25,766","Of course, of course.
It's a real struggle"
822,"00:42:25,768","00:42:27,068",and my heart goes out to them.
823,"00:42:27,070","00:42:29,390","It's very tough, very sad. I
don't want to get any letters."
824,"00:42:29,638","00:42:31,773","But this guy, come on!"
825,"00:42:31,775","00:42:33,406","Oh, what about these?"
826,"00:42:33,408","00:42:35,242","That's just something
I do for fun,"
827,"00:42:35,244","00:42:37,779","when I'm not focusing
on my real work."
828,"00:42:37,781","00:42:39,245",These are beautiful.
829,"00:42:39,247","00:42:40,480",You don't have to say that.
830,"00:42:40,482","00:42:42,583","I mean, they must be good
if I like them,"
831,"00:42:42,585","00:42:44,184",given how much I hate rabbits.
832,"00:42:44,186","00:42:48,321","I mean, somehow, you managed to make
them look not like the vermin they are."
833,"00:42:48,323","00:42:50,625",Vermin? Vermin?
834,"00:42:50,627","00:42:52,527","- What does ""vermin"" mean?
- Like a rodent."
835,"00:42:52,529","00:42:55,663",Rodent? Rodent?
836,"00:42:55,665","00:42:56,797","What does ""rodent"" mean?"
837,"00:42:56,799","00:42:59,131",Like a rat or a mouse.
838,"00:42:59,133","00:43:01,403","You think rabbits are vermin?
You're joking, right?"
839,"00:43:02,839","00:43:05,104",Yes. I'm joking.
840,"00:43:05,106","00:43:08,307","'Cause I'm hilarious and
whimsical."
841,"00:43:08,309","00:43:11,410","Rabbits are actually
perfect creatures."
842,"00:43:11,412","00:43:13,080","They're generous,"
843,"00:43:13,082","00:43:15,182","honest, pure."
844,"00:43:15,184","00:43:16,551","You should see the way
they talk to each other."
845,"00:43:16,553","00:43:19,086","They do this incredible thing
when they're apologizing."
846,"00:43:19,088","00:43:20,487","- Rabbits apologize?
- Mmm-hmm."
847,"00:43:20,489","00:43:23,158","They put their heads
together, like this."
848,"00:43:24,292","00:43:25,860","No. No, no, no,
don't apologize to him."
849,"00:43:25,862","00:43:27,694",Why is she apologizing to him?
850,"00:43:27,696","00:43:30,165",Why is she apologizing to him?
851,"00:43:32,233","00:43:34,869","Wow,
that's taking a long time."
852,"00:43:34,871","00:43:37,574","She's apologizing
the heck out of that guy."
853,"00:43:39,207","00:43:41,842","And this was
only the beginning."
854,"00:43:41,844","00:43:45,549","It didn't get any easier for
Peter and the others to stomach."
855,"00:43:46,148","00:43:47,451",Or understand.
856,"00:43:47,717","00:43:49,085",Anyway.
857,"00:43:49,719","00:43:50,851",You'll see.
858,"00:43:50,853","00:43:52,419",You'll grow to love them.
859,"00:43:52,421","00:43:55,421","But romance
is a powerful thing."
860,"00:43:55,423","00:43:57,724","It can sneak up
on any two people."
861,"00:43:57,726","00:44:00,227","Even if one is amazing,"
862,"00:44:00,229","00:44:02,663",and the other is a McGregor.
863,"00:44:02,665","00:44:04,465","♪ Girl, I say"
864,"00:44:04,467","00:44:09,305","♪ If only life would
lean our way"
865,"00:44:10,607","00:44:14,341","♪ Well, you and me
we'd run away"
866,"00:44:14,343","00:44:20,147","♪ To be wherever
our adventure awaits"
867,"00:44:21,316","00:44:24,151","♪ I heard your heart say
love, love, love"
868,"00:44:25,621","00:44:30,525","♪ I heard your heart say

love, love, love"
870,"00:44:35,430","00:44:38,632","♪ I heard your heart say
love, love, love"
871,"00:44:38,634","00:44:41,536","And after my parents
died, I was put in a group home."
872,"00:44:41,538","00:44:42,503",Peel.
873,"00:44:42,505","00:44:44,704","That must have been awfully
traumatic for you."
874,"00:44:44,706","00:44:46,238","Did you deal
with it okay? Peel."
875,"00:44:46,240","00:44:48,244","Didn't affect me in the
slightest. Peel."
876,"00:44:48,844","00:44:50,412","Yes, I can see that."
877,"00:44:51,379","00:44:53,245",Maybe I have some tendencies.
878,"00:44:53,247","00:44:55,949","Yeah, to commit rabbit-cide."
879,"00:44:55,951","00:44:57,451","- Is that a word?
- No."
880,"00:44:57,453","00:45:01,256","Well, I think we all have
our tendencies. Peel."
881,"00:45:01,658","00:45:02,790",What are yours?
882,"00:45:02,792","00:45:04,423",I guess I don't like people
883,"00:45:04,425","00:45:06,627","who aren't who
they say they are."
884,"00:45:06,629","00:45:08,194",It's more about me.
885,"00:45:08,196","00:45:09,296","I keep saying
I'm a real painter,"
886,"00:45:09,298","00:45:11,964","yet I can't seem
to finish anything real."
887,"00:45:11,966","00:45:13,668",But she paints us.
888,"00:45:13,670","00:45:14,802",We're real.
889,"00:45:14,804","00:45:16,770","- Aren't we real?
- Ow!"
890,"00:45:16,772","00:45:18,806","- Yep, definitely real.
- Huh?"
891,"00:45:18,808","00:45:20,775","What do you miss
most about the store?"
892,"00:45:20,777","00:45:23,511","And don't say, ""Having
everything in its proper place."""
893,"00:45:23,513","00:45:24,645",I get it.
894,"00:45:24,647","00:45:26,314",You have control issues.
895,"00:45:27,216","00:45:28,417",I miss being helpful.
896,"00:45:29,350","00:45:31,417","A parent or grandparent
comes into the shop"
897,"00:45:31,419","00:45:34,386","looking for a gift
for the child they love."
898,"00:45:34,388","00:45:38,294","I ask a few simple questions, and
know exactly what they need."
899,"00:45:40,462","00:45:43,499","I love helping people
get what they want."
900,"00:45:43,833","00:45:44,931",You know?
901,"00:45:44,933","00:45:47,436","Especially when they don't
even know that they want it."
902,"00:45:48,303","00:45:49,438",Those are the best.
903,"00:45:51,940","00:45:54,674","Also, neatly arranged displays.
I'm sorry, I can't help it."
904,"00:45:56,979","00:45:59,714",Yes! Bananas! I win!
905,"00:45:59,716","00:46:01,648","Wait, ""taradiddle""
isn't a word."
906,"00:46:01,650","00:46:03,984","Yes, it is. It means ""fib,""
""pretentious nonsense."""
907,"00:46:03,986","00:46:08,688","That is exactly the sort of definition
you'd make up for a made-up word."
908,"00:46:08,690","00:46:12,596","Mr. McGregor, are you accusing
me of taradiddling?"
909,"00:46:13,696","00:46:18,598","♪ I heard your heart say

913,"00:46:27,276","00:46:28,478",I'll protect you.
914,"00:46:30,012","00:46:32,381","♪ Love, love, love"

- Huh."
919,"00:46:50,600","00:46:52,469","- Closed.
- Pull up a chair."
920,"00:46:52,902","00:46:54,735",We're wearing fur.
921,"00:46:54,737","00:46:56,737","- Thank you.
- You're drenched. Sit down."
922,"00:46:56,739","00:46:58,370",Let me help you dry off.
923,"00:46:58,372","00:46:59,509",Thank you very much.
924,"00:47:15,090","00:47:17,828",I could stay here forever.
925,"00:47:19,462","00:47:20,527",Hiya.
926,"00:47:21,997","00:47:23,630",Hello.
927,"00:47:23,632","00:47:25,964","Haven't seen you
in the longest time."
928,"00:47:25,966","00:47:27,935","Meet my new friend, Thomas."
929,"00:47:27,937","00:47:30,674","- Would you like to have a hold?
- Among other things."
930,"00:47:33,008","00:47:34,909","Oh, look."
931,"00:47:34,911","00:47:38,345","My two boys
getting along perfectly."
932,"00:47:38,347","00:47:40,815",Nothing could make me happier.
933,"00:47:40,817","00:47:42,482",Do you mind if I paint this?
934,"00:47:42,484","00:47:44,951",Nothing would make me happier.
935,"00:47:51,093","00:47:53,761","You're mine now, rabbit."
936,"00:48:08,844","00:48:12,880","Thomas, are your eyes emerald
or sea-foam green?"
937,"00:48:12,882","00:48:15,414","Uh, sea-foam green with a hint
of battleship gray."
938,"00:48:15,416","00:48:16,585",I thought so.
939,"00:48:23,859","00:48:25,592",Thomas?
940,"00:48:25,594","00:48:28,961","And that's what separates us
from the French."
941,"00:48:28,963","00:48:30,864",Yup. Kiwi green.
942,"00:48:30,866","00:48:32,334",You're the professional.
943,"00:48:35,571","00:48:36,770",Yay.
944,"00:48:36,772","00:48:37,774",Ooh.
945,"00:48:38,908","00:48:39,909",Yay.
946,"00:48:40,643","00:48:41,645",Ooh.
947,"00:48:41,944","00:48:43,710",Yay. Ooh.
948,"00:48:43,712","00:48:44,944",Yay. Ooh.
949,"00:48:44,946","00:48:47,349",Yay. Ooh.

1325,"01:09:43,370","01:09:46,270","On the contrary,
it's one of its many beauties."
1326,"01:09:46,272","01:09:47,673",I have some good news.
1327,"01:09:47,675","01:09:49,408",Bannerman's no longer with us.
1328,"01:09:49,410","01:09:53,412","- He died.
- Earring infection in both ears."
1329,"01:09:53,414","01:09:56,749","Said it was the stress
of working here for one day."
1330,"01:09:56,751","01:09:59,718","Quit, moved to France,
of course."
1331,"01:09:59,720","01:10:01,821","- I'm sorry, is he dead?
- No."
1332,"01:10:01,823","01:10:04,355","I thought maybe ""moving
to France"" was a euphemism."
1333,"01:10:04,357","01:10:06,357","The job's yours
if you want it,"
1334,"01:10:06,359","01:10:08,360","pending a psychological
evaluation,"
1335,"01:10:08,362","01:10:10,361",but you seem much better.
1336,"01:10:10,363","01:10:12,329",Interested?
1337,"01:10:12,331","01:10:13,732","Where would I find
men's scarves?"
1338,"01:10:13,734","01:10:14,767","- Lower ground.
- Lower ground."
1339,"01:10:14,769","01:10:16,902","Just take the escalator down.
Right, right, left."
1340,"01:10:16,904","01:10:19,104","With your hip-to-waist ratio,
I'd suggest a green check."
1341,"01:10:19,439","01:10:20,809",You work here?
1342,"01:10:21,075","01:10:22,076",Do you?
1343,"01:10:23,109","01:10:24,443",Do you?
1344,"01:10:24,445","01:10:25,580",I'm thinking.
1345,"01:10:29,451","01:10:30,819","- Do you?
- I..."
1346,"01:10:35,823","01:10:37,258",I'm gonna go make this right.
1347,"01:10:38,258","01:10:39,791",I've wrecked our home.
1348,"01:10:39,793","01:10:41,258",I've wrecked Bea's home.
1349,"01:10:41,260","01:10:43,160",I'm a real home-wrecker.
1350,"01:10:43,162","01:10:45,764","Think I'm using
that expression properly."
1351,"01:10:45,766","01:10:47,332","I got us into this,"
1352,"01:10:47,334","01:10:49,167",and I let you all down.
1353,"01:10:49,169","01:10:50,204",I'm really sorry.
1354,"01:10:51,071","01:10:53,174",I prepared a speech.
1355,"01:10:54,273","01:10:55,807","""I got us into this,"
1356,"01:10:55,809","01:10:57,208","""and I let you all down."
1357,"01:10:57,210","01:10:58,211","""I'm really sorry."""
1358,"01:10:59,379","01:11:01,947","I guess that was
the whole thing."
1359,"01:11:01,949","01:11:03,782","Kind of crushed it
the first time."
1360,"01:11:08,956","01:11:10,822","I should've listened
to you, Benjamin."
1361,"01:11:10,824","01:11:13,357","Not just about this,
about everything."
1362,"01:11:13,359","01:11:14,959",You're so much wiser than me.
1363,"01:11:14,961","01:11:16,764",It wasn't about the garden.
1364,"01:11:17,532","01:11:19,230","I don't know where
I'd be without you."
1365,"01:11:19,232","01:11:20,702","In a pie, probably."
1366,"01:11:21,300","01:11:22,834",Probably.
1367,"01:11:22,836","01:11:24,839","And I should've been
a better big brother."
1368,"01:11:26,507","01:11:27,972","Truth is,"
1369,"01:11:27,974","01:11:29,977","I'm a little lost
without Mum and Dad."
1370,"01:11:30,845","01:11:32,477",I miss them so much.
1371,"01:11:32,479","01:11:34,245","- So do we.
- Yeah."
1372,"01:11:34,247","01:11:35,249","Me, too."
1373,"01:11:46,493","01:11:48,360","So, are we good?"
1374,"01:11:48,362","01:11:49,865","This was pretty bad,"
1375,"01:11:50,296","01:11:51,733",even for you.
1376,"01:11:58,138","01:11:59,340","I'm scared, Peter."
1377,"01:12:00,374","01:12:02,541",Don't be. I'm gonna fix this.
1378,"01:12:02,543","01:12:03,975","- What should we do?
- Just make sure"
1379,"01:12:03,977","01:12:05,812","she doesn't leave
until I get back."
1380,"01:12:05,814","01:12:08,082","Should we break
both ankles or just one?"
1381,"01:12:09,982","01:12:11,853","I'm sorry, that was weird."
1382,"01:12:12,286","01:12:13,418","- Both.
- What?"
1383,"01:12:13,420","01:12:15,855","Just stall her.
I won't let you down."
1384,"01:12:15,857","01:12:17,926","- I promise.
- You can count on us."
1385,"01:12:19,527","01:12:21,459","Also, I didn't kill
old McGregor."
1386,"01:12:21,461","01:12:23,294",He died of a heart attack.
1387,"01:12:23,296","01:12:24,962","- We know.
- The whole time."
1388,"01:12:24,964","01:12:27,298","- We thought you needed a victory.
- Okay, then."
1389,"01:12:27,300","01:12:28,868",Laser-focused
1390,"01:12:28,870","01:12:31,035","with a half thought-out plan,"
1391,"01:12:31,037","01:12:33,606","this is what
a hero looks like."
1392,"01:12:33,608","01:12:36,141",Or a lunatic.
1393,"01:12:36,143","01:12:38,847","The line between the two
is very blurry."
1394,"01:12:40,112","01:12:42,548","Okay, listen up.
Here's what we're going to do."
1395,"01:12:42,550","01:12:43,981","Wait, why do you
get to be in charge?"
1396,"01:12:43,983","01:12:45,249",Because I'm the oldest.
1397,"01:12:45,251","01:12:47,319","- By 16 seconds.
- Ugh."
1398,"01:12:47,321","01:12:50,355","Oh, Mopsy. Sweet, sweet Mopsy."
1399,"01:12:50,357","01:12:53,459","Wait, you both know
that I'm the oldest, right?"
1400,"01:12:53,461","01:12:54,560",Huh?
1401,"01:12:54,562","01:12:56,360",♪ When I wake up
1402,"01:12:56,362","01:12:59,029","♪ Well, I know I'm gonna be"
1403,"01:12:59,031","01:13:00,932","Here we go, just gotta...
Oops, sorry."
1404,"01:13:00,934","01:13:04,069",Sorry. Sorry. Sorry. Sorry.
1405,"01:13:04,071","01:13:07,071","♪ I'm gonna be the man
who goes along with you ♪"
1406,"01:13:07,073","01:13:09,042","Sorry. Sorry.
Oh, no, it's leaving."
1407,"01:13:11,143","01:13:12,477",Wait for me!
1408,"01:13:12,479","01:13:13,946",Benjamin!
1409,"01:13:13,948","01:13:15,046",You're coming with me?
1410,"01:13:15,048","01:13:18,950","Yes, it's my character flaw."
1411,"01:13:18,952","01:13:20,985",But there's no other character
1412,"01:13:20,987","01:13:24,388","I'd rather have
a flaw for than you..."
1413,"01:13:26,058","01:13:27,493",I'm so glad you came.
1414,"01:13:27,495","01:13:29,327","I feel terrible
that I hurt you."
1415,"01:13:29,329","01:13:30,995",I prepared a speech.
1416,"01:13:30,997","01:13:32,364","""I feel terrible that..."""
1417,"01:13:32,366","01:13:33,397",Benjamin!
1418,"01:13:33,399","01:13:35,468","No! Benjamin, I'm sorry!"
1419,"01:13:35,470","01:13:37,669","Run! Run, jump! You can do it!"
1420,"01:13:37,671","01:13:38,970",You can... Yes!
1421,"01:13:38,972","01:13:41,175","Peter, you're a terrible
apologizer."
1422,"01:13:52,620","01:13:55,655","Excuse me, town mouse, do you
know how to get to Harrods?"
1423,"01:13:55,657","01:13:57,388",Absolutely.
1424,"01:13:57,390","01:13:58,957",Are you boys from the country?
1425,"01:13:58,959","01:13:59,858",How can you tell?
1426,"01:13:59,860","01:14:02,293","Brown on brown.
It's a bit matchy-matchy."
1427,"01:14:02,295","01:14:03,294",Mmm-hmm.
1428,"01:14:03,296","01:14:05,163","Come with me, I'll give you
the grand tour."
1429,"01:14:05,165","01:14:06,964","Thanks.
We're kind of in a hurry."
1430,"01:14:06,966","01:14:08,366","Plenty to see
along the way."
1431,"01:14:08,702","01:14:10,334",Tower Bridge.
1432,"01:14:10,336","01:14:11,704",Buckingham Palace.
1433,"01:14:11,706","01:14:13,404",Guards wearing beavers.
1434,"01:14:13,406","01:14:14,507",Big Ben.
1435,"01:14:14,509","01:14:16,207",Much larger than I thought.
1436,"01:14:16,209","01:14:17,543",View of the skyline.
1437,"01:14:17,545","01:14:19,712","It's just stunning,
but, Johnny,"
1438,"01:14:19,714","01:14:21,980","we're on a time-sensitive
mission,"
1439,"01:14:21,982","01:14:24,015","and it seems like
you're drawing it out a bit"
1440,"01:14:24,017","01:14:25,685","because of pride
for your hometown."
1441,"01:14:25,687","01:14:29,354","London's one of the most culturally
significant cities in the world."
1442,"01:14:29,356","01:14:31,691","What kind of host would I be
if I didn't share it with you?"
1443,"01:14:31,693","01:14:35,329","You're right, if we're actually
here, we should see everything."
1444,"01:14:38,165","01:14:39,330","Thanks, Johnny,
we owe you one."
1445,"01:14:39,332","01:14:43,168","My pleasure. Always happy
to help out a fellow rodent."
1446,"01:14:44,604","01:14:45,972",Rodent?
1447,"01:14:49,676","01:14:52,077",It's a shame.
1448,"01:14:52,079","01:14:54,917","But don't worry, I'll get you
to the train on time."
1449,"01:15:09,329","01:15:10,331",Yes!
1450,"01:15:14,000","01:15:15,567","Who would
do such a thing?"
1451,"01:15:15,569","01:15:17,037",I have many enemies.
1452,"01:15:18,170","01:15:20,307","Okay, he's got to be here."
1453,"01:15:24,010","01:15:26,446","Where is he? Where is he?
Where is he?"
1454,"01:15:27,214","01:15:30,080",A talking bunny doll?
1455,"01:15:30,082","01:15:32,618",I am a rabbit.
1456,"01:15:32,620","01:15:34,322",I like carrots.
1457,"01:15:35,054","01:15:36,491","Beep-boop, beep..."
1458,"01:15:44,564","01:15:46,699","This isn't happening.
He's just an illusion."
1459,"01:15:46,701","01:15:49,602",Deep breaths. Deep breaths.
1460,"01:15:49,604","01:15:51,603",Mr. McGregor. Psst.
1461,"01:15:51,605","01:15:53,307",Remember me from before?
1462,"01:15:54,608","01:15:56,575","No, no, no, no!
I just want to talk."
1463,"01:15:56,577","01:15:58,109",I just want to talk.
1464,"01:15:58,111","01:16:01,746","Rabbits don't talk!
I knew you could talk!"
1465,"01:16:01,748","01:16:04,553","Wait, are you talking
or am I just hallucinating?"
1466,"01:16:06,385","01:16:08,721","Call Security. He's gone
crackers again."
1467,"01:16:08,723","01:16:10,992",You ruined my life!
1468,"01:16:14,094","01:16:15,126",McGregor!
1469,"01:16:15,128","01:16:16,598",You got to come back with us.
1470,"01:16:17,832","01:16:20,131","Back to Bea.
She's about to leave."
1471,"01:16:20,133","01:16:22,167","She's gonna give up painting
and go home."
1472,"01:16:22,169","01:16:23,535","She wants nothing
to do with me."
1473,"01:16:23,537","01:16:25,670","That's because she thinks
this is all your fault."
1474,"01:16:25,672","01:16:29,541","But we both know that I had a little
tiny something to do with it."
1475,"01:16:29,543","01:16:30,810","""Little""?"
1476,"01:16:30,812","01:16:32,511","- ""Tiny""?
- Okay, a lot."
1477,"01:16:32,513","01:16:34,547","I'm not good at owning up
to my mistakes."
1478,"01:16:34,549","01:16:36,280",I'm working on it.
1479,"01:16:36,282","01:16:39,019","- McGregor!
- I just hope it's not too late."
1480,"01:16:39,687","01:16:40,852",I let her down.
1481,"01:16:40,854","01:16:42,419",It's over.
1482,"01:16:42,421","01:16:43,556",It's not.
1483,"01:16:43,558","01:16:44,824",I just wanted you gone.
1484,"01:16:44,826","01:16:46,659","I didn't think of
anyone but myself."
1485,"01:16:46,661","01:16:48,293",I'm sorry I electrocuted you.
1486,"01:16:48,295","01:16:49,829","I'm sorry I put
traps on your head."
1487,"01:16:49,831","01:16:51,797","I'm sorry I rubbed my butt
on your hairbrush."
1488,"01:16:51,799","01:16:53,598",Wait. Wait. What?
1489,"01:16:53,600","01:16:55,335",Nothing. Stay focused.
1490,"01:16:56,571","01:16:58,504",Please come back. Not for me.
1491,"01:16:58,506","01:17:01,175","- For Bea.
- How do I know this isn't a trick?"
1492,"01:17:02,710","01:17:03,741",You don't.
1493,"01:17:03,743","01:17:05,379",You just have to trust me.
1494,"01:17:06,278","01:17:07,482",Trust us.
1495,"01:17:08,582","01:17:10,316","So you really are
talking?"
1496,"01:17:10,818","01:17:13,150","No. Like you said,"
1497,"01:17:13,152","01:17:15,855","you chilled out, man.
You're cool now."
1498,"01:17:15,857","01:17:17,455","And you're listening
to your heart."
1499,"01:17:17,457","01:17:18,723",That's what you're hearing.
1500,"01:17:18,725","01:17:20,692","McGregor!
Unlock this door!"
1501,"01:17:20,694","01:17:21,727",Now listen to your heart.
1502,"01:17:21,729","01:17:22,727","It's telling you to turn left,"
1503,"01:17:22,729","01:17:24,496","run six paces to that window,
break it open,"
1504,"01:17:24,498","01:17:26,501","and let's get the
heck out of here!"
1505,"01:17:28,201","01:17:30,271",McGregor! Open up!
1506,"01:17:35,710","01:17:37,077",McGregor!
1507,"01:17:45,853","01:17:48,352","And so the two
former enemies"
1508,"01:17:48,354","01:17:51,355","and one of their cousins
set out across the country,"
