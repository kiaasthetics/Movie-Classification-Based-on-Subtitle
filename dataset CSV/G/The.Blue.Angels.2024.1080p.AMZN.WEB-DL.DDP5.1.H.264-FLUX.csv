around the world throughout the years."
18,"00:02:27,125","00:02:30,541","And... and naval aviation was a home
and was something that"
19,"00:02:30,625","00:02:31,916",I feel like I was meant to do.
20,"00:02:36,041","00:02:38,875","It was something that
I wanted to do since I was a kid."
21,"00:02:38,958","00:02:42,208","Something that I never thought
was actually gonna happen."

of the entire squadron"
23,"00:02:47,125","00:02:48,833",rotates back to the fleet.
24,"00:02:48,916","00:02:51,916","The challenge for every boss

our practice over El Centro."
35,"00:04:57,750","00:04:59,101","- Fired up, ready to go.
- All right."
36,"00:04:59,125","00:05:02,125","I'll take a safety for rolling up
to low brake cross at 450."
37,"00:05:03,958","00:05:05,642","Pay Doc ten dollars
for a zipper and a collar."

- Yes, sir, Boss."

but underline deep sag on the fan rollout."

I fully dedicate myself,"
42,"00:05:16,291","00:05:17,875",and I can look back in 20 years
43,"00:05:17,958","00:05:21,791","and say I gave every fiber of my being
to getting better at it."
44,"00:05:21,875","00:05:23,458","But you come to the Blue Angels,"
45,"00:05:23,541","00:05:25,500","and that really happens
in that first season"
46,"00:05:25,583","00:05:28,291","where you're trying
to figure this thing out."
47,"00:05:28,375","00:05:29,958",That can be scary.
48,"00:05:30,041","00:05:31,721","I'll fix it all.
I'm glad to be here, Boss."
49,"00:05:31,791","00:05:32,934","- All right, Whiskers.
- Yes, sir, Boss,"
50,"00:05:32,958","00:05:34,934","I'll take safeties for being 296 knots
out of the PUB."
51,"00:05:34,958","00:05:37,041",Pay Doc five dollars for pregame jitters.
52,"00:05:37,125","00:05:38,767","I'll fix it all. I'm glad to be here,
Boss."
53,"00:05:38,791","00:05:40,142","- Day taps, Boss.
- Good jet."
54,"00:05:40,166","00:05:42,875",Good jet.
55,"00:05:42,958","00:05:44,708","All right, roll it!"
56,"00:05:44,791","00:05:47,833","There's a crucible
you have to go through together."
57,"00:05:54,208","00:05:58,500","It has to be six pilots
totally synced up, flying as one."
58,"00:05:58,583","00:06:00,500",Go! Let's go!
59,"00:06:00,583","00:06:03,303","You are clear
to taxi via runway two-four-A."
60,"00:06:05,875","00:06:07,875",How's it going?
61,"00:06:11,083","00:06:15,083","And it can be frustrating at times
to train brand-new guys from the fleet."
62,"00:06:19,375","00:06:22,833","One of the first things we go out and do
is just do basic turns."
63,"00:06:22,916","00:06:24,916","We turn left, we turn right."
64,"00:06:25,000","00:06:27,166","Three, two, nine, seven, four..."
65,"00:06:28,958","00:06:31,208","And just do that
over and over again,"
66,"00:06:31,291","00:06:35,166","because if you don't have the right
foundation, it's just not gonna work."
67,"00:06:45,291","00:06:46,583",Rip it.
68,"00:06:51,166","00:06:52,926","As the boss,
you're the flight leader."
69,"00:06:53,000","00:06:54,083",You're the conductor.
70,"00:06:54,166","00:06:55,966","You're the lead goose
in the formation, right?"
71,"00:06:59,041","00:07:00,541",Ready? Hit it.
72,"00:07:03,125","00:07:05,625",These jets are max performing.
73,"00:07:08,583","00:07:13,416","At low altitudes, at high air speeds,
in close proximity to other aircraft."
74,"00:07:13,500","00:07:16,166","I have to be steady at the helm,
as they say."
75,"00:07:16,250","00:07:18,791",Ease in the power.
76,"00:07:22,625","00:07:25,500",Chomps flies in the four position.
77,"00:07:25,583","00:07:30,166","He's back there watching
and making sure that we're good."
78,"00:07:30,250","00:07:32,970","The number four
pilot for the Blue Angels."

You can see what Boss is doing."
81,"00:07:38,125","00:07:39,958","You can see what
all the wingmen are doing."
82,"00:07:42,625","00:07:44,625","And you're kind of
the airborne safety observer"
83,"00:07:44,708","00:07:46,958","because you have
that best seat in the house."
84,"00:07:48,916","00:07:50,291",Yes.
85,"00:07:50,375","00:07:52,125","\an8As the flight surgeon on the team,"

- Okay, rolling."
88,"00:07:57,791","00:08:03,291","I study the demo
inside and out for every position."
89,"00:08:04,375","00:08:08,875","I know where they should be at all times:
their altitude, their air speeds."
90,"00:08:11,125","00:08:15,250","With two brand-new pilots
on the team this year,"
91,"00:08:15,333","00:08:18,875",I am constantly watching them.
92,"00:08:23,250","00:08:25,892","Chewy, you kind of start a little flat,
and you're trying to hold it in there,"
93,"00:08:25,916","00:08:27,625",and Jamammy actually goes deep.
94,"00:08:27,708","00:08:29,583",Is that kind of what you're seeing?
95,"00:08:29,666","00:08:32,541","Cheese and I
are 100% the newbies."
96,"00:08:32,625","00:08:34,250","Steep learning curve, for sure."
97,"00:08:34,333","00:08:36,250",Just feel deflated
98,"00:08:36,333","00:08:37,726",and like you're the worst pilot ever.
99,"00:08:37,750","00:08:39,041",How did I get here?
100,"00:08:39,125","00:08:40,708",It just rippled through the formation.
101,"00:08:40,791","00:08:43,708","So, like, Jamammy was first,
I was second, then Cheese was third,"
102,"00:08:43,791","00:08:47,250","and just, like, the whole formation
shifted, then had to shift back into set."
103,"00:08:48,416","00:08:52,000","So, this year, we've had
a new two pilot, a new three pilot,"
104,"00:08:52,083","00:08:53,791","I'm filling a new role as the slot pilot,"
105,"00:08:53,875","00:08:56,458","a new six pilot in the demo,"
106,"00:08:56,541","00:08:59,875","and then our number five pilot,
he was out half the year last year,"
107,"00:08:59,958","00:09:01,791","not flying in the demo,
so we're getting him"
108,"00:09:01,875","00:09:03,875",learning how to fly in formation again.
109,"00:09:05,500","00:09:10,083","We're bringing five new people
into this formation and making one demo."
110,"00:09:15,791","00:09:17,333",Good work. See you in a little bit.
111,"00:09:17,416","00:09:19,708","- Yeah.
- Whoo!"
112,"00:09:23,375","00:09:26,208","It's one team, six jets."
113,"00:09:26,291","00:09:28,833","\an8We all do something
a little bit different."
114,"00:09:28,916","00:09:30,708","\an8We'll start the show with four jets,"
115,"00:09:30,791","00:09:32,875",\an8the Diamond takeoff maneuver.
116,"00:09:35,541","00:09:38,875","\an8And then you'll have the two
solo individual takeoff maneuvers."
117,"00:09:49,583","00:09:54,166","Generally, our maneuvers alternate
between Diamond and solos."
118,"00:09:55,666","00:09:59,458","And by the end of the show, we'll get
the Delta together, all six jets."
119,"00:10:01,416","00:10:05,333","\an8The Delta Formation is the signature
formation of the Blue Angels."
120,"00:10:09,458","00:10:11,392","Early on in winter training,
both Chomps and I"
121,"00:10:11,416","00:10:14,958","are heads on a swivel, making sure
our new guys are learning that"
122,"00:10:15,041","00:10:17,250","we've got enough space
to get out of the way."
123,"00:10:20,375","00:10:22,125",Cheese is a guy who's an aggressive guy.
124,"00:10:22,208","00:10:24,434","If you're riding a horse,
you got to pull back on the reins."
125,"00:10:24,458","00:10:27,166","He's a little more pull-back-on-the-reins
type of guy."
126,"00:10:29,666","00:10:31,642","We had to use a term called
""knock it off"" a couple times,"
127,"00:10:31,666","00:10:33,583",meaning we're stopping right now.
128,"00:10:33,666","00:10:35,875","Cheese was bringing in
a whole bag of knots."
129,"00:10:35,958","00:10:38,291",Coming in way too hot.
130,"00:10:38,375","00:10:40,916","I'm looking over my shoulder going,
""This ain't gonna work."""
131,"00:10:44,458","00:10:46,833","Three spot's
incredibly challenging."
132,"00:10:46,916","00:10:50,000","A big departure from what you do
in terms of fleet flying."
133,"00:10:50,083","00:10:53,291","You're also on kind of
the more difficult side of the formation."
134,"00:10:53,375","00:10:56,291","We're all very used to looking left
when we fly,"
135,"00:10:56,375","00:10:58,791","which is what Cheese gets to do
in the two spot."
136,"00:10:58,875","00:11:01,476","On the left side, in that three spot,
you're looking right the whole time."
137,"00:11:01,500","00:11:04,250","All your controls are
right in front of you or to the left."
138,"00:11:05,333","00:11:08,333","And it's just sort of
an unnatural position to be in."
139,"00:11:11,958","00:11:16,458","The very first time the Diamond
was practicing the Vertical Break..."
140,"00:11:19,166","00:11:21,333",...Jamammy went the wrong way.
141,"00:11:30,916","00:11:33,750","You think to yourself,
okay, as a safety officer,"
142,"00:11:33,833","00:11:35,458",is he safe? Number one.
143,"00:11:35,541","00:11:39,375","Two, do I speak up and get in his cockpit,
or do I stay silent right now"
144,"00:11:39,458","00:11:41,583",and watch what he does to recover?
145,"00:11:46,875","00:11:49,708","You have to make that decision,
and I decided:"
146,"00:11:49,791","00:11:51,666",Remain quiet. This is his first time.
147,"00:11:51,750","00:11:53,125",He looks safe.
148,"00:11:53,208","00:11:55,500","He may be going
the wrong direction."
149,"00:11:55,583","00:11:58,583","It's not funny, but it doesn't look like
he's gonna hit anybody else."
150,"00:12:00,250","00:12:02,250",Kind of scared us.
151,"00:12:02,333","00:12:05,791","It was like, how is he gonna
respond to this, right?"
152,"00:12:05,875","00:12:09,541","Did he rattle himself to the point
where he's not able to compartmentalize,"
153,"00:12:09,625","00:12:11,041",put that one in the past?
154,"00:12:16,083","00:12:18,916","Two flat on the in.
Little mismatch, break the seal."
155,"00:12:19,000","00:12:22,208","Apex ten left, two wide
and five tight in the up."
156,"00:12:22,291","00:12:24,208",Vertical up was three left.
157,"00:12:24,291","00:12:27,958","It's an incredible amount of stress
going in on the newbies."
158,"00:12:28,958","00:12:31,791","You're constantly being told
what you did wrong."
159,"00:12:31,875","00:12:34,000","So, Cheese, we actually overbanked,
it looked like."
160,"00:12:34,083","00:12:35,434",Did you feel good about that one today?
161,"00:12:35,458","00:12:36,767","Cheese, see how tight you look there?"
162,"00:12:36,791","00:12:38,726","- And, Cheese, you just drifted forward again.
- Yep."
163,"00:12:38,750","00:12:40,708","All of us are way fast,
and we're all idle/boards"
164,"00:12:40,791","00:12:43,625","trying to control everything
in close here."
165,"00:12:43,708","00:12:47,375","Everyone comes into this team
a relatively accomplished pilot, thinking,"
166,"00:12:47,458","00:12:49,250","""I feel comfortable flying an F-18,"
167,"00:12:49,333","00:12:52,041","I feel... I feel pretty good
about my abilities as a pilot,"""
168,"00:12:52,125","00:12:55,333","but this place is the...
it's the great equalizer."
169,"00:12:57,958","00:12:59,750",Time away from family is...
170,"00:12:59,833","00:13:02,916","is the most difficult part
of being on this team."
171,"00:13:03,000","00:13:06,291","Work in El Centro
for three months in a cocoon."
172,"00:13:06,375","00:13:08,791","Which we need to be...
you need that kind of safe place"
173,"00:13:08,875","00:13:12,166","to get it to a point where
we can take it on the road."
174,"00:13:13,333","00:13:15,750",But it's just such a grind.
175,"00:13:15,833","00:13:18,291",It's monotonous. It's Groundhog Day.
176,"00:13:18,375","00:13:21,583","You're waking up in the desert
every day in the dark,"

179,"00:13:29,958","00:13:31,958","Going home in the dark,"
180,"00:13:32,041","00:13:35,083","and then you're studying
for your flight the next day."
181,"00:13:37,208","00:13:39,750","I'm not the most
academically sound person,"
182,"00:13:39,833","00:13:41,833",and it's a struggle.
183,"00:13:43,208","00:13:46,041","So, flying two to three times a day,
that's what you need."
184,"00:13:46,125","00:13:48,375",I absolutely needed it.
185,"00:13:50,708","00:13:52,500",This is how I typically do it.
186,"00:13:52,583","00:13:54,166","Bring it inboard a little bit,"
187,"00:13:54,250","00:13:56,666","and I'll extend a little bit here,
and then that'll make"
188,"00:13:56,750","00:13:58,666","the arc feel more normal
as we come in here."
189,"00:13:58,750","00:14:00,291","- Yes, sir, Boss.
- Questions?"
190,"00:14:00,375","00:14:01,684","- None.
- All right, fired up, ready to go."
191,"00:14:01,708","00:14:03,541","Fired up, ready to go, Boss."
192,"00:14:05,458","00:14:10,083","We're all responsible for our lives
with... in no uncertain terms."
193,"00:14:10,166","00:14:12,625","Everybody's lives are in
each other's hands,"
194,"00:14:12,708","00:14:16,541","that they're not going to do something
that we don't expect."
195,"00:14:19,500","00:14:21,583",It's an unforgiving business.
196,"00:14:21,666","00:14:23,666",Rip it.
197,"00:14:32,416","00:14:33,833",Great job today.
198,"00:14:33,916","00:14:36,101","Thanks, Boss. It was amazing.
See you back at the ranch."
199,"00:14:36,125","00:14:37,445","You got it, Mo."
200,"00:14:41,583","00:14:44,000","You walk down the halls
in El Centro, and you see"
201,"00:14:44,083","00:14:47,166","all the faces that have made up
the past of this organization."
202,"00:14:47,250","00:14:49,375","Legendary figures who you hear about,"
203,"00:14:49,458","00:14:51,250","you hear whispers about
throughout the fleet."
204,"00:14:52,458","00:14:54,298","Boss Wooldridge...
he's one of the first people"
205,"00:14:54,375","00:14:55,958",I met after I made the team.
206,"00:14:57,375","00:14:59,375",He's a legend.
207,"00:14:59,458","00:15:01,351","One of
the unique things about him is"
208,"00:15:01,375","00:15:02,541",he got called back
209,"00:15:02,625","00:15:04,875","to be the boss of the Blue Angels
three total times."
210,"00:15:04,958","00:15:06,875","He's the only guy
that's done it three times."
211,"00:15:09,083","00:15:10,375",He has spent so much time.
212,"00:15:10,458","00:15:14,208","\an8He's intimately familiar
with what goes on."
213,"00:15:14,291","00:15:17,011","\an8When I came
to the Blue Angels, I was amazed"
214,"00:15:17,041","00:15:20,875","at how close the formations were
and-and the maneuvers."
215,"00:15:22,333","00:15:25,250",How can you do that?
216,"00:15:25,333","00:15:27,583","But as Vince Lombardi said,"
217,"00:15:27,666","00:15:31,625","we're gonna go out there today,
and we're gonna ""chase perfection."""
218,"00:15:31,708","00:15:34,208","We'll never get perfection,
but along the way,"
219,"00:15:34,291","00:15:36,791",we're going to realize excellence.
220,"00:15:36,875","00:15:39,833","...accelerate to
300 miles per hour."
221,"00:15:39,916","00:15:41,767","The markers toward
getting to excellence"
222,"00:15:41,791","00:15:43,916","is when you're able to, as a formation,"
223,"00:15:44,000","00:15:45,916",feel like you can move it in closer.
224,"00:15:48,083","00:15:50,833","We define our season
by what we call our sets,"
225,"00:15:50,916","00:15:53,083",which is how close we fly together.
226,"00:15:55,291","00:15:58,101","At the beginning of the season,
we'll start in our furthest-out set,"
227,"00:15:58,125","00:15:59,708",which we call the Fleet Parade.
228,"00:15:59,791","00:16:02,458","As close as you would ever fly
in the Navy."
229,"00:16:02,541","00:16:04,583","\an8And then as we start to progress,"
230,"00:16:04,666","00:16:08,458","\an8we'll start to bring those sets in
a little bit tighter to Blue Gold."
231,"00:16:08,541","00:16:10,166","\an8When we say Blue Gold set,"
232,"00:16:10,250","00:16:12,625",\an8it's where the line of the blue paint
233,"00:16:12,708","00:16:15,375",\an8and the gold paint actually meet.
234,"00:16:15,458","00:16:20,041","\an8That's where Jamammy's gonna
put in his head, is underneath that."
235,"00:16:20,125","00:16:22,541",\an8And that's about 18 inches apart.
236,"00:16:22,625","00:16:24,559","\an8If you raise your hands
above your head,"
237,"00:16:24,583","00:16:27,125","it'd be from the top of your fingertips

238,"00:16:27,208","00:16:29,583",is 18 inches away from each other.

241,"00:16:35,666","00:16:38,333","The next step would be
our closest set, which is Yankee,"
242,"00:16:38,416","00:16:40,333","meaning that he's
going to put his aircraft"
243,"00:16:40,416","00:16:42,833","underneath the ""Y"" on my left wing."
244,"00:16:42,916","00:16:46,291","\an8So, Jamammy, he's actually gonna
slide up underneath like that."
245,"00:16:47,375","00:16:50,833","\an8That creates that parallax that we're all
in that perfect Diamond Formation"
246,"00:16:50,916","00:16:54,250",\an8and almost have our wingtips overlapping.
247,"00:16:59,083","00:17:02,208","As the new number two,
I set the formation."
248,"00:17:03,250","00:17:07,375","I need to be perfect in every way
because everybody looks at me"
249,"00:17:07,458","00:17:09,000",to set the distance.
250,"00:17:10,375","00:17:12,083","If I'm off by a letter,"
251,"00:17:12,166","00:17:14,291","Jamammy then looks at that
and he sets it off of me,"
252,"00:17:14,375","00:17:16,875","and then Chomps sets that distance
off of both of us."
253,"00:17:16,958","00:17:20,375","So, if there's any mismatch down the line,"
254,"00:17:20,458","00:17:22,583","essentially, it's probably caused by me."
255,"00:17:30,583","00:17:34,083","People just don't realize
how physically demanding the flight is."
256,"00:17:38,041","00:17:39,541","I mean, the demo is"
257,"00:17:39,625","00:17:42,958","45 minutes of, as Blue Angel eight
calls it, pure violence."
258,"00:17:48,291","00:17:51,500","We had, first of all,
a 45-pound spring"
259,"00:17:51,583","00:17:53,500",pulling the stick away from us.
260,"00:17:53,583","00:17:57,000","You couldn't get a good feel for it
unless it was pulling away from you"
261,"00:17:57,083","00:17:59,083",at about 45 pounds.
262,"00:18:01,916","00:18:05,791","It is a full-body workout
when these aviators fly,"
263,"00:18:05,875","00:18:08,083","from their feet to their hands
to their head."
264,"00:18:10,083","00:18:12,333",They use their entire body
265,"00:18:12,416","00:18:14,708",to combat g-forces.
266,"00:18:19,166","00:18:21,726","\an8When you're pulling g's
in the aircraft, all your blood"
267,"00:18:21,791","00:18:24,916","\an8is rushing down to your legs,
to your lower extremities."
268,"00:18:25,000","00:18:27,416","\an8And once that blood leaves your head,"
269,"00:18:27,500","00:18:30,250","you're then at risk
of loss of consciousness."
270,"00:18:33,041","00:18:35,083","First sign is
you're gonna lose your vision"
271,"00:18:35,166","00:18:38,916",and start graying out... tunnel vision.
272,"00:18:39,000","00:18:44,000","In order to combat that, we're gonna push
that blood back up with our muscles."
273,"00:18:44,083","00:18:47,333","Squeezing the legs,
the butt, the abs."
274,"00:18:47,416","00:18:50,958","And if it's a real heavy g pull,
then making sure I lock down"
275,"00:18:51,041","00:18:52,541",a three-quarter-lung-capacity breath.
276,"00:19:06,291","00:19:10,708","As a pilot, you understand the risk."
277,"00:19:10,791","00:19:13,250","You do a job where,
at practice, in training,"
278,"00:19:13,333","00:19:15,375",you can end it all in an accident.
279,"00:19:18,250","00:19:20,458",So it's just... it's a mix of emotions.
280,"00:19:28,000","00:19:30,040","What we do
is very dangerous."
281,"00:19:30,083","00:19:34,041","First couple times you take off,
you got to push the ""I believe"" button."
282,"00:19:34,125","00:19:36,333","\an8But one of the things we learn
in flight school"
283,"00:19:36,416","00:19:38,416",\an8very early on is it's a team sport.
284,"00:19:38,500","00:19:40,541","\an8We're all the same,
cut from the same cloth."
285,"00:19:42,708","00:19:47,125","The risk is never any lower
when we go out and practice"
286,"00:19:47,208","00:19:50,125","as it is when we're doing the actual show,
so we take"
287,"00:19:50,208","00:19:51,833",a fine-tooth comb to everything.
288,"00:20:07,333","00:20:08,934","It looked like
we were good, and..."
289,"00:20:08,958","00:20:10,833",We were good until a half mile.
290,"00:20:10,916","00:20:13,184","That's gonna be your focus
for tomorrow, is that arc."
291,"00:20:13,208","00:20:15,166","So let's take a hammer down
to that one tomorrow."
292,"00:20:15,250","00:20:16,708",Really try to fine-tune that.
293,"00:20:18,500","00:20:21,166","During the debrief,
we dissect everything."
294,"00:20:21,250","00:20:23,458","There's definitely times
at the end of days"
295,"00:20:23,541","00:20:25,934","where you're frustrated
'cause you can't get a maneuver right."
296,"00:20:25,958","00:20:29,333","And not only do you know
that you did it incorrectly in the air,"
297,"00:20:29,416","00:20:32,750","but now you get to watch it
frame by frame on a TV screen,"
298,"00:20:32,833","00:20:34,833","like, zoomed in with an HD camera,"
299,"00:20:34,916","00:20:37,708","so you can really see
how bad you were, you know."
300,"00:20:37,791","00:20:41,208","But that's-that's part of it.
That's how we... that's how we get better."
301,"00:20:41,291","00:20:44,833","Every single person does that,
including Boss."
302,"00:20:44,916","00:20:47,476","That's, like... that's a tendency for me,
probably a tendency for somebody else,"
303,"00:20:47,500","00:20:49,017",is you're trying to get down this much...
304,"00:20:49,041","00:20:51,458",You should be your own worst critic.
305,"00:20:51,541","00:20:52,916",That's a commitment we have.
306,"00:20:53,000","00:20:55,000","It's easy to say, tough to do."
307,"00:20:55,083","00:20:56,851","Be a better version of yourself.
Be a better teammate."
308,"00:20:56,875","00:20:58,416",Help the team get better every day.
309,"00:21:00,916","00:21:03,916","Let's go, let's go, let's go."

315,"00:21:19,958","00:21:22,875","and so far, over El Centro,

a few thousand people there"

371,"00:24:27,708","00:24:29,892","Think about that tonight,
and think about when you get in there,"
372,"00:24:29,916","00:24:32,708","just like we talked about,
everything from the walk down,"

by looking around."
375,"00:24:39,041","00:24:40,666",Stay focused inside the canopy.
376,"00:24:40,750","00:24:43,541","And then once we're on the runway,
it's same as it ever was."
377,"00:24:43,625","00:24:45,017","So, with that, I'm glad to be here."
378,"00:24:45,041","00:24:46,625",Rip it!
379,"00:25:16,250","00:25:18,309","We're going to try to do
what we can to make the demo"

as entertaining as possible."
381,"00:25:22,791","00:25:24,416",But that's not my line.

to do a lot of twirls and loops and rolls,"
422,"00:29:35,125","00:29:36,541","but to do it together,"
423,"00:29:36,625","00:29:39,875","to make six jets fly as one,

that show in El Centro,"

519,"00:36:52,208","00:36:53,875","It's doable. I mean, we've got two."

614,"00:41:44,791","00:41:46,767","So we just need to focus on that set
down the line, especially..."
615,"00:41:46,791","00:41:48,416",Chomps is a big softie.
616,"00:41:48,500","00:41:50,625",He just understands the stakes at play.
617,"00:41:50,708","00:41:53,500","I mean, he's the guy
that has the best vantage point"

every second, every day."
619,"00:41:58,750","00:42:03,625","That's a heavy weight, and Boss kind of
owns that as the commanding officer."
620,"00:42:03,708","00:42:05,416",But there are things I just can't see.
621,"00:42:06,500","00:42:08,250","And back there, we had some depth..."
622,"00:42:08,333","00:42:12,250","Chomps is, uh,
our lone Marine Corps pilot."
623,"00:42:12,333","00:42:14,173","We make fun of him,
call him General Zastoupil,"
624,"00:42:14,250","00:42:16,666",because he kind of gives off that persona
625,"00:42:16,750","00:42:19,125","when he... when he goes
and talks to people."
626,"00:42:19,208","00:42:21,101","All right, so big take away
is now gonna be reducing"
627,"00:42:21,125","00:42:23,541",the overreaction for the flat there.
628,"00:42:24,416","00:42:25,726","Yeah, I was trying not to hit him."
629,"00:42:25,750","00:42:29,791","I know, but that's a huge, huge
dump on the nose."
630,"00:42:29,875","00:42:33,083","That's correct. It's also the closest
I've ever been to a jet."
631,"00:42:33,166","00:42:35,666","- So...
- I can freeze it and hold it, but..."
632,"00:42:37,291","00:42:38,958",There's gotta be some sort of compromise.
633,"00:42:39,041","00:42:42,083","Like you just have to keep driving more
to just kinda get away,"
634,"00:42:42,166","00:42:45,166","but not that huge just dumping
of the nose away from the formation."
635,"00:42:45,250","00:42:46,833",Looked pretty gross up there.
636,"00:42:46,916","00:42:49,208","Uh, Delta Roll will be a focus
into tomorrow as well."
637,"00:42:49,291","00:42:51,041","Bearing lines, matching of the rate."
638,"00:42:52,583","00:42:55,458","There's one Marine option
in the Blue Angels"
639,"00:42:55,541","00:42:57,625","at any given time, so we can only have one"
640,"00:42:57,708","00:43:01,041","jet demonstration pilot
on any particular year."
641,"00:43:01,125","00:43:02,500",So this year is my final year.
642,"00:43:04,291","00:43:07,875","My job is to try to bring everyone
together on the same page"
643,"00:43:07,958","00:43:10,750","so there's never any, like,
lingering questions between the elements."
644,"00:43:10,833","00:43:13,291","And so that's why it kind of rests
on the number four spot,"
645,"00:43:13,375","00:43:16,208","always a second-year guy,
to do the debrief."
646,"00:43:21,458","00:43:23,458","We're gonna be on the road
quite a bit coming up."
647,"00:43:23,541","00:43:26,750","Quite a... quite a bit.
And it's a lot of time away from family."
648,"00:43:26,833","00:43:31,333","That's something that we also don't get
that much of, is time with our families."
649,"00:43:32,458","00:43:36,166","So, when we come here,
we try to spend as much time as we can."
650,"00:43:36,250","00:43:38,250","And when I walked out
of the house this morning,"
651,"00:43:38,333","00:43:40,333","I had one daughter attached
to my left leg, saying,"

655,"00:44:10,625","00:44:13,500","It is so cool to see
the reactions of the public."

rock star with this high-paced lifestyle."
657,"00:44:18,041","00:44:20,666","Yeah? Uh, a lot of practice."
658,"00:44:20,750","00:44:23,541","And then in the evenings,
we attend commits"
659,"00:44:23,625","00:44:26,125",where we'll go to a local outreach event.

706,"00:47:48,250","00:47:51,958","It's a unique process,
picking my replacement."
707,"00:48:05,041","00:48:08,041","There's only a handful of people
who ever experience this."
708,"00:48:10,958","00:48:13,708","The boss application...
there is no other time that you can apply"
709,"00:48:13,791","00:48:15,250","for the Blue Angels, right?"
710,"00:48:15,333","00:48:17,583",So it's a very final thing.
711,"00:48:18,583","00:48:22,125","They've flown down here
from all corners of the world."
712,"00:48:23,208","00:48:25,000",And this is some life-changing news.
713,"00:48:25,083","00:48:26,458",Maybe a lifelong dream.
714,"00:48:30,625","00:48:32,875","For me, back in the '90s,"
715,"00:48:32,958","00:48:36,375","I was just an average
squadron commanding officer."
716,"00:48:36,458","00:48:38,666","You know, they would never pick me."
717,"00:48:38,750","00:48:40,875",Why even try?
718,"00:48:40,958","00:48:43,291",So I was relaxed and honest.
719,"00:48:43,375","00:48:45,750","You know, ""I'm just gonna be me."""
720,"00:48:45,833","00:48:49,666","And I was shocked when they pulled me out,"
721,"00:48:49,750","00:48:52,333","outside the room, said, ""You're the guy."""
722,"00:48:52,416","00:48:54,541","Oh, boy. Whew."
723,"00:49:06,041","00:49:08,791","And that was a life changer.
I was real surprised."
724,"00:49:13,416","00:49:17,166","It's a tough decision.
I mean, these folks are all Olympians."
725,"00:49:18,250","00:49:21,041",These folks work their entire life.
726,"00:49:21,125","00:49:24,708","You've heard of the gold medalist,
maybe the silver or even the bronze,"
727,"00:49:24,791","00:49:29,083","but someone comes in fourth
and no one knows their name."
728,"00:49:32,666","00:49:35,750","First off, thank you,
everyone. Very, very well done."
729,"00:49:35,833","00:49:37,392",Please hold your heads high.
730,"00:49:37,416","00:49:39,101","- Very well done. Very well done.
- Thank you."
731,"00:49:39,125","00:49:40,333",Very well done.
732,"00:49:40,416","00:49:41,934","- Okay.
- We'll come on out here."
733,"00:49:41,958","00:49:43,125",Awesome.
734,"00:49:44,833","00:49:46,333",All right.
735,"00:49:47,625","00:49:49,642","You won't start getting
your PAO training right away,"
736,"00:49:49,666","00:49:52,066","but you'll be expected to say
a few things, uh, to the press."
737,"00:49:52,125","00:49:55,000","Right, your-your most important thing
to do right now is"
738,"00:49:55,083","00:49:56,392","- you're gonna call your wife.
- Mm-hmm."
739,"00:49:56,416","00:49:57,976",Give her a call... make it a quick one...
740,"00:49:58,000","00:49:59,767","- and call your... call your mom and dad.
- Yeah. Yeah."
741,"00:49:59,791","00:50:02,191","Okay, then let me know.
Just give them a couple of minutes..."
742,"00:50:02,250","00:50:04,208","That was, uh,
extremely emotional, for sure."
743,"00:50:04,291","00:50:06,833","Uh, surprising to start,
and then a... and then a..."
744,"00:50:06,916","00:50:08,666",just a flood of different emotions.
745,"00:50:09,916","00:50:12,708","My name's Commander Alex Armatas.
Call sign is ""Scribe."""
746,"00:50:12,791","00:50:16,541","I grew up in Central New York, and, uh,
very young I knew I wanted to fly."

to not be the one,"
751,"00:50:25,000","00:50:27,208","so now I'm very quickly
having to come to terms"
752,"00:50:27,291","00:50:29,934","with the fact that this will be, uh...
this will be my role next, and, uh..."
753,"00:50:29,958","00:50:31,541","and I need to get ready for that, so..."
754,"00:50:31,625","00:50:33,958","So, what do you think?
Shock? Shock and awe?"
755,"00:50:34,041","00:50:36,083","- Yeah, big-time.
- Yeah. Yeah, me, too."
756,"00:50:36,166","00:50:37,875","I think, uh..."
757,"00:50:37,958","00:50:40,666","- Job's gonna be different than you think.
- Yeah?"
758,"00:50:40,750","00:50:43,500","It's gonna be challenging
in aspects you don't know."
759,"00:50:43,583","00:50:45,101","- I wouldn't trade it for the world.
- Yeah."
760,"00:50:45,125","00:50:46,791",It's been fantastic.
761,"00:50:50,291","00:50:51,708",I appreciate it. Thank you.

763,"00:50:56,458","00:50:58,101","As mentioned, my name's
Commander Alex Armatas."
764,"00:50:58,125","00:50:59,916","Uh, it is an absolute honor to be here."
765,"00:51:00,000","00:51:03,166","It's, uh, very humbling, very emotional,
as Captain Kesselring mentioned."
766,"00:51:03,250","00:51:04,750","Admiral, thank you as well, sir."
767,"00:51:04,833","00:51:06,500","Uh, and, uh, just..."
768,"00:51:06,583","00:51:08,226","Even though
he's a very skilled leader"
769,"00:51:08,250","00:51:09,625","and very skilled aviator,"
770,"00:51:09,708","00:51:12,500","he's gonna go through that same crucible,
that same learning curve."
771,"00:51:12,583","00:51:15,458","As I look back, oh, boy."
772,"00:51:15,541","00:51:17,476","There's just... he doesn't know
what he doesn't know yet."
773,"00:51:18,583","00:51:20,392","- Does this get easier with time? This...
- Yeah."
774,"00:51:20,416","00:51:21,616",Does it get easier? I hope so.
775,"00:51:21,666","00:51:23,351","- How you doing? Outstanding job. Yeah.
- Thanks, Admiral. I appreciate it."
776,"00:51:23,375","00:51:25,000","- Outstanding.
- Yeah, this is, uh..."
777,"00:51:25,083","00:51:27,333",I hope it gets easier the more you do it.

at the backgrounds and all that."

everything about that individual"
831,"00:55:32,083","00:55:34,083","before they get here

during the interview process,"

amongst 17 people in the room"

and discussion to reach that consensus."
838,"00:55:58,791","00:56:00,517","Obviously,
you're gonna pick the people"
839,"00:56:00,541","00:56:02,333",you think will be the absolute best.
840,"00:56:02,416","00:56:04,291",Sometimes that takes five minutes.
841,"00:56:04,375","00:56:06,791","Sometimes that takes four hours.

very personal conversations"
843,"00:56:10,500","00:56:13,333","with personal details
about this individual's life"
844,"00:56:13,416","00:56:16,083","that the general public
doesn't need to ever know."

that we'll talk about in there,"
846,"00:56:18,291","00:56:21,375","and at the end of the night,
we all slap the table and say,"

those are your new people."
850,"00:56:33,875","00:56:35,791",There has to be a unanimous decision.
851,"00:56:35,875","00:56:38,500","But if we don't pick the right people
to carry on that legacy,"
852,"00:56:38,583","00:56:40,208",then what we've done is just a failure.

883,"00:59:30,291","00:59:33,083","an opportunity to get a close look
at the precision flying"
884,"00:59:33,166","00:59:36,083","that produces the 18-inch
wingtip-to-canopy separation"
885,"00:59:36,166","00:59:38,125",between these four aircraft.
886,"00:59:38,208","00:59:41,166","From the right, the Blue Angel Diamond."
887,"00:59:45,583","00:59:47,958","Looking at it,
the start of the season,"
888,"00:59:48,041","00:59:51,081","you know, I'd think, ""Man, there's no way
I'm gonna get this close to a jet."""
889,"00:59:53,125","00:59:55,500","Especially for the Diamond 360,
which is what we consider"
890,"00:59:55,583","00:59:57,416",one of our hardest maneuvers.
891,"00:59:57,500","00:59:59,541",They're at 360.
892,"01:00:04,958","01:00:07,666","We just bumped it
into Blue Gold set."
893,"01:00:08,750","01:00:12,750","Scott... Jamammy... he's currently
up under, you know, Boss's wing."
894,"01:00:13,750","01:00:16,416","Now, me on the other side,
because of parallax,"
895,"01:00:16,500","01:00:18,184","I'm not actually sliding myself
up underneath."
896,"01:00:18,208","01:00:21,583","\an8What I'm actually doing is I'm sliding
outboard and forward."
897,"01:00:24,208","01:00:25,958",You have Frank underneath my wing
898,"01:00:26,041","01:00:28,458","doing almost the exact same thing
that Scott is doing,"
899,"01:00:28,541","01:00:30,666",just a little bit more aft.
900,"01:00:31,666","01:00:33,351","It's kind of getting
not so much comfortable,"
901,"01:00:33,375","01:00:35,726","but it's getting familiar, uh,
to the point where it's like,"
902,"01:00:35,750","01:00:37,267","""Man, we're actually really doing this."""
903,"01:00:37,291","01:00:39,750","You know, this is...
this is the aspect of the Blue Angels"
904,"01:00:39,833","01:00:43,166","that no other demonstration team
really reaches."
905,"01:00:50,833","01:00:53,208","But the Yankee set
at the start of the season"
906,"01:00:53,291","01:00:55,625",is something you really want to get
907,"01:00:55,708","01:00:59,500","and you don't completely know
if maybe you'll actually get there, but..."
908,"01:00:59,583","01:01:01,383","There's teams that have done this
in the past,"
909,"01:01:01,416","01:01:02,916",and then there's teams that haven't.
910,"01:01:04,625","01:01:08,041","Now that we're starting to get
in that regime of flight,"
911,"01:01:08,125","01:01:10,125",will we get there?
912,"01:01:10,208","01:01:11,583","Hopefully, yes."
913,"01:02:04,791","01:02:07,625","Of course, the crowd favorite
is the Sneak."
914,"01:02:15,708","01:02:17,601","The Diamond
will execute their maneuver,"
915,"01:02:17,625","01:02:20,083","showcasing the precision flying,
uh, that is required"
916,"01:02:20,166","01:02:22,125",of all Navy and Marine Corps pilots.
917,"01:02:22,208","01:02:26,083","And then as we're setting up for our
next maneuver, we get the solos in there,"
918,"01:02:26,166","01:02:28,958","who just pull on the stick a lot
and provide the filler."
919,"01:02:44,625","01:02:45,976","The Diamond's
favorite maneuvers are when"
920,"01:02:46,000","01:02:47,309","they get to break apart from Boss,"
921,"01:02:47,333","01:02:49,750","act like a solo,
and then once that's over,"
922,"01:02:49,833","01:02:51,833",they're back to being the Diamond.
923,"01:02:51,916","01:02:54,101","I mean, the Diamond, everybody knows
they're-they're the better pilots here."
924,"01:02:54,125","01:02:55,309",Every... Literally everybody knows.
925,"01:02:55,333","01:02:58,333","You know that you actually have to think
about those around you,"
926,"01:02:58,416","01:02:59,791","like, be a team player."
927,"01:02:59,875","01:03:01,083",They just don't get that yet.
928,"01:03:01,166","01:03:03,126","So, maybe one day,
they'll understand that, but..."
929,"01:03:03,208","01:03:04,351",Fun and excitement.
930,"01:03:04,375","01:03:06,875","Definitely, the solos use a lot more
than Diamond."
931,"01:03:06,958","01:03:08,833","They're all flying off of Boss, so..."
932,"01:03:08,916","01:03:11,541","Healthy competition...
that's exactly what it is."
933,"01:03:28,041","01:03:31,000","After I left
Pensacola for finalist week,"
934,"01:03:31,083","01:03:32,875","it was just me and my husband
at the house."
935,"01:03:32,958","01:03:35,198","We were kind of waiting
and anticipating this phone call."
936,"01:03:36,208","01:03:39,125","I was the very first person
to call in, uh, so I called in"
937,"01:03:39,208","01:03:41,750","and, uh, they kind of joked around
with me and they said,"
938,"01:03:41,833","01:03:44,416","""Hey, you have the wrong number.
Try calling this number back."""
939,"01:03:44,500","01:03:47,333",So I am in panic mode immediately.
940,"01:03:47,416","01:03:49,642",We tend to mess with them a little bit...
941,"01:03:49,666","01:03:51,476","when they, uh...
when they call in for the selectees, so..."
942,"01:03:52,666","01:03:54,916","We have a five-minute window to call in,"
943,"01:03:55,000","01:03:56,500","so I'm-I'm going through my messages,"
944,"01:03:56,583","01:03:59,041","making sure I have the right...
the right number."
945,"01:03:59,125","01:04:01,165","I call back. They're like,
""Still the wrong number."""
946,"01:04:01,208","01:04:05,166","We're listening in as Cody has got some
rock music playing in the background."
947,"01:04:05,250","01:04:06,916",I get a call from Boss.
948,"01:04:07,000","01:04:10,041","- He's like...
- Amanda, weren't you supposed to call in a couple minutes ago?"
949,"01:04:10,125","01:04:12,500","I-I was like, ""I have done
something terribly wrong."
950,"01:04:12,583","01:04:14,291","I'm in trouble."""
951,"01:04:14,375","01:04:16,642","He's like, ""Hey, next year, when you...
when you're on the team,"
952,"01:04:16,666","01:04:18,517","maybe we'll get your timeline
a little bit better."""
953,"01:04:18,541","01:04:20,583","And then everybody said,
""Welcome to the team."""
954,"01:04:20,666","01:04:22,958",But they had me super frazzled.
955,"01:04:23,041","01:04:25,500","A history-making day
for the legendary Blue Angels."
956,"01:04:25,583","01:04:28,458","\an8The Navy's elite flight squadron

an aviation electronics technician,"
964,"01:04:52,750","01:04:54,583",and I started working on the F-18.
965,"01:04:55,666","01:04:58,625","I get to my first squadron,

you're challenged enough."""
967,"01:05:01,875","01:05:03,708",And the only thing I knew in the Navy
968,"01:05:03,791","01:05:05,875","was aviation, so I was like,
""Let's try to fly."""

we give short shrift"

get that formation."

on the Blue Angels,"
990,"01:06:50,166","01:06:52,083",it feels like an eternity.

a newbie on the team."""
993,"01:07:02,083","01:07:04,666","You finally kind of know
what you're doing."
994,"01:07:35,583","01:07:37,458",Rip it.
995,"01:07:39,916","01:07:42,875","It's kind of fun watching

not knowing anything but fleet flying"

1014,"01:08:50,083","01:08:54,125","And it can be challenging at times and
sometimes have to learn new techniques"
1015,"01:08:54,208","01:08:56,184","to make sure they can perform
at the highest levels"
1016,"01:08:56,208","01:08:58,291",before they can be on the team.

and sit down as best"
1025,"01:09:19,250","01:09:21,250",or as easy as possible.
1026,"01:09:21,333","01:09:25,083","A g-suit is something
that we strap on, and they will inflate"

the amount of g's you're pulling,"
1028,"01:09:27,708","01:09:30,458","to help you sustain g's

1058,"01:10:48,916","01:10:51,208","I don't say that to people.
That was awesome."
1059,"01:10:54,291","01:10:56,750","\an8Today, there are no g-suits."
1060,"01:10:57,916","01:11:00,250",And the reason we require that is because
1061,"01:11:00,333","01:11:03,458","we do not fly with g-suits
in the Blue Angels."
1062,"01:11:05,458","01:11:07,458","- Welcome back.
- Yeah."
1063,"01:11:07,541","01:11:09,061","The g-suit fills up with air,"
1064,"01:11:09,125","01:11:12,250","so the way we fulcrum
with our-our arm on our leg,"
1065,"01:11:12,333","01:11:15,250","if that were to inflate,
it would move our arm"
1066,"01:11:15,333","01:11:17,750","and inherently just move the aircraft,
so we don't do that."
1067,"01:11:17,833","01:11:21,250","Okay, we're gonna
start the profile now."
1068,"01:11:21,333","01:11:24,500","We have five profiles
that every Blue Angel aviator"
1069,"01:11:24,583","01:11:27,791","will go through in the centrifuge
which represent"
1070,"01:11:27,875","01:11:29,750","what they experience
when flying in the jet."
1071,"01:11:38,000","01:11:41,166","And those are the high-g profiles,
and one of which is"
1072,"01:11:41,250","01:11:44,166","the PUB, the Pitch-Up Break,
which is our very last maneuver,"
1073,"01:11:44,250","01:11:47,166","\an8where the pilots will pull
seven and a half g's"
1074,"01:11:47,250","01:11:49,416","\an8to break around the airfield
before landing."
1075,"01:11:51,041","01:11:54,791","\an8But it's critical that
they stay awake during that maneuver."
1076,"01:11:56,708","01:11:59,208",So we've taken that demonstration profile
1077,"01:11:59,291","01:12:01,625",and simulated it in the centrifuge
1078,"01:12:01,708","01:12:04,083","so that we can train to it
before getting into the jet."
1079,"01:12:04,166","01:12:05,416","All right, I have controls."
1080,"01:12:05,500","01:12:07,125","Going to seven g's, five seconds."
1081,"01:12:11,250","01:12:13,375","\an8Okay, legs tight. Breath."

1088,"01:12:29,583","01:12:32,458","It gets people
when it drops off like that."
1089,"01:12:33,541","01:12:36,517","It's the weirdest thing
to have a g-induced loss of consciousness."
1090,"01:12:36,541","01:12:39,250","You don't even know
where you are or what you are."
1091,"01:12:39,333","01:12:44,208","I mean, it's just like
your whole conscious self is gone."
1092,"01:12:44,291","01:12:46,541","Alex, you okay?"
1093,"01:12:46,625","01:12:48,541","- Yeah.
- All right."

it was a difficult profile,"
1120,"01:13:59,208","01:14:02,625","and I just kind of sat down and...
and just-just wanted to..."
1121,"01:14:02,708","01:14:04,958","just wanted to relax
and do nothing for a few minutes."
