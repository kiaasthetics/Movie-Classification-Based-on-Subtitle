3,"00:01:12,160","00:01:14,550","without wind or tide,
they will come together."""
4,"00:01:37,200","00:01:41,274","That's how my parents met.
Like two ships destined for each other."
5,"00:01:45,640","00:01:48,039","We are something
else. Try Arthur Treacher..."
6,"00:01:55,280","00:01:56,280",It's okay.
7,"00:02:04,560","00:02:08,719",Easy. You weren't breathing.
8,"00:02:22,280","00:02:24,351","They were
from different worlds."
9,"00:02:26,080","00:02:30,313","But life, like the sea,
has a way of bringing people together."
10,"00:03:13,600","00:03:14,600",Uh...
11,"00:03:16,360","00:03:17,794",I was gonna make you some eggs.
12,"00:03:20,240","00:03:21,560","Just don't eat my dog, okay?"
13,"00:03:25,240","00:03:26,310",It's okay.
14,"00:03:26,680","00:03:28,080",I made tea.
15,"00:03:33,040","00:03:34,440","Go on, try it."
16,"00:03:34,680","00:03:35,750",It'll make you better.
17,"00:03:56,920","00:03:58,832","So, uh, who are you?"
18,"00:04:03,120","00:04:04,520",Atlanna.
19,"00:04:06,520","00:04:08,159",Queen of Atlantis.
20,"00:04:09,840","00:04:10,840",Wow.
21,"00:04:12,000","00:04:16,677",I'm Tom. Keeper of lighthouse.
22,"00:04:48,080","00:04:50,239","She had fled
an arranged marriage."
23,"00:04:50,240","00:04:52,199",Left her whole world behind.
24,"00:04:52,200","00:04:56,558","But in my father's lighthouse,
she found something unexpected."
25,"00:04:59,600","00:05:03,310","And my father
found the love of his life."
26,"00:05:08,120","00:05:09,799",Category 4 Hurricane Arthur
27,"00:05:09,800","00:05:12,315","is due to make landfall
sometime after 2:00 P.M."
28,"00:05:12,440","00:05:14,591",How about Arthur?
29,"00:05:15,360","00:05:16,794",After the hurricane?
30,"00:05:16,960","00:05:20,954","After a legend.
He's a king, isn't he?"
31,"00:05:21,560","00:05:24,439",He's more than that.
32,"00:05:24,560","00:05:27,314","He's living proof
our people can coexist."
33,"00:05:28,160","00:05:30,755",He could unite our worlds one day.
34,"00:05:38,120","00:05:42,751","And the trident could only
be wielded by the strongest Atlantean."
35,"00:05:43,200","00:05:48,070","And it gave King Atlan mastery
over the seven seas."
36,"00:05:48,640","00:05:52,759","It made him so powerful that
the ocean itself became jealous"
37,"00:05:52,880","00:05:56,556","and sent a terrible earthquake
to destroy Atlantis."
38,"00:05:57,280","00:05:59,556","Down it fell,
to the bottom of the ocean."
39,"00:05:59,720","00:06:04,112","But, legend has it
that one day a new king will come"
40,"00:06:04,280","00:06:06,639","who will use the
power of the trident"
41,"00:06:06,640","00:06:09,519",to put Atlantis back together again.
42,"00:06:15,880","00:06:17,553",Take him!
43,"00:06:36,160","00:06:37,435","Queen Atlanna,"
44,"00:06:37,600","00:06:42,277","by the authority of King Orvax,
you are ordered to return to Atlantis."
45,"00:06:42,640","00:06:43,710",Atlanna!
46,"00:06:46,760","00:06:48,831",But Atlantis' memory is long...
47,"00:06:51,120","00:06:53,351",And its king refused to let her go.
48,"00:07:06,360","00:07:08,033","- Atlanna!
- Tom!"
49,"00:07:08,440","00:07:10,318","My weapon!
Here!"
50,"00:07:37,120","00:07:39,874","Their two worlds
were never meant to meet,"
51,"00:07:40,040","00:07:43,112","and I was a product of a love
that never should've been."
52,"00:07:43,240","00:07:45,072","You don't have to do this, Atlanna.
Please."
53,"00:07:45,240","00:07:48,597",No. They will always find me.
54,"00:07:49,440","00:07:50,874","Next time, they'll send an army."
55,"00:07:53,240","00:07:57,519","I have to go back.
It is the only way to save him."
56,"00:08:00,840","00:08:02,513",Save you.
57,"00:08:07,200","00:08:09,032",Where I come from...
58,"00:08:10,840","00:08:13,560",The sea carries our tears away.
59,"00:08:16,240","00:08:17,240",Not here.
60,"00:08:18,680","00:08:20,239",Here you feel them.
61,"00:08:28,360","00:08:32,513","I will return to you.
When it's safe."
62,"00:08:33,360","00:08:34,396",One day.
63,"00:08:34,520","00:08:37,433","Right here, at sunrise."
64,"00:08:40,360","00:08:41,794",We'll be together again.
65,"00:08:43,880","00:08:46,236","You stay strong, my little prince."
66,"00:08:46,720","00:08:48,712",I'll always be with you.
67,"00:08:57,320","00:09:00,313",Don't let him forget me. Hmm?
68,"00:09:25,360","00:09:30,071","All life came from the sea,
so if we want to understand ourselves,"
69,"00:09:30,200","00:09:31,953",we must journey to where we began.
70,"00:09:32,120","00:09:36,999","Now, today, we have better maps of Mars
than we do of our own sea floor."
71,"00:09:37,000","00:09:39,037","Come on, closer. Come on, fishy."
72,"00:09:39,160","00:09:41,072","Come on. Come over here.
Boys!"
73,"00:09:41,480","00:09:43,597",Stop that. Come on.
74,"00:09:43,840","00:09:45,832",Come along.
75,"00:09:46,040","00:09:49,158","Bye, fishy. Bye."
76,"00:09:49,960","00:09:52,680",My name's Arthur. What's yours?
77,"00:09:53,120","00:09:55,589","- You guys hungry? Me, too.
- Check it out."
78,"00:09:56,400","00:09:58,676",Arthur is talking to the fish.
79,"00:09:58,800","00:09:59,800","Such a freak, Arthur."
80,"00:09:59,960","00:10:03,112","Stop!
What are you gonna do about it, freak?"
81,"00:10:03,240","00:10:05,072",Stop it! Don't!
82,"00:10:05,200","00:10:06,429",Let me go!
83,"00:12:04,040","00:12:05,040",Who are you?
84,"00:12:05,200","00:12:06,873","Come on, let's go. Move it."
85,"00:12:07,000","00:12:08,957",Come on. Hurry up.
86,"00:12:18,360","00:12:19,919","Sir, we've secured the captain."
87,"00:12:20,040","00:12:21,235",Distress signal's disabled.
88,"00:12:21,360","00:12:23,477",We're running dark again.
89,"00:12:23,600","00:12:25,432","But they heard it.
You can count on it."
90,"00:12:26,120","00:12:29,750","I'll make you a deal.
I won't tell you how to captain..."
91,"00:12:30,720","00:12:32,677","And you don't tell
me how to pirate."
92,"00:12:44,000","00:12:45,359","Where's the
rest of the crew?"
93,"00:12:45,360","00:12:47,272","Decided discretion
was the better part of valor"
94,"00:12:47,400","00:12:49,392","and sealed themselves up
in the torpedo bay."
95,"00:12:49,520","00:12:51,159",Our reputation precedes us.
96,"00:12:51,160","00:12:52,594",Your reputation.
97,"00:12:52,720","00:12:54,040",This is your win.
98,"00:12:59,040","00:13:00,269",Here.
99,"00:13:01,920","00:13:03,752",Can't take that piece of junk.
100,"00:13:04,240","00:13:05,515",It's the love of your life.
101,"00:13:07,160","00:13:09,311","I never told you
the story behind it."
102,"00:13:10,480","00:13:11,630",This was your grandfather's.
103,"00:13:13,120","00:13:16,716","He was one of the Navy's first
frogmen during World War II."
104,"00:13:16,840","00:13:20,993","He was so stealthy in the water,
his unit nicknamed him Manta."
105,"00:13:22,520","00:13:25,354","But after the war,
his country forgot about him."
106,"00:13:25,480","00:13:29,679","So, he went back to the sea,
scavenging and surviving with his wit..."
107,"00:13:30,360","00:13:31,874",And this knife.
108,"00:13:32,400","00:13:35,199","He gave it to me
when I was your age."
109,"00:13:38,200","00:13:39,793","And now it's yours, son."
110,"00:14:08,840","00:14:10,640",Did we just hit something?
111,"00:14:12,160","00:14:14,755",No. Something hit us.
112,"00:14:15,360","00:14:16,719","Sir, there's something out there."
113,"00:14:16,720","00:14:17,790",Another submarine?
114,"00:14:18,000","00:14:19,759",Uh... No. I think it's a man.
115,"00:15:08,040","00:15:09,440",That's not a man.
116,"00:15:13,440","00:15:16,911","Alpha, to the right.
Bravo team, sweep the passageway."
117,"00:15:39,240","00:15:40,469",Permission to come aboard?
118,"00:17:11,240","00:17:12,240",Aquaman!
119,"00:17:40,960","00:17:43,759","I've waited
a long time for this."
120,"00:17:57,560","00:17:59,074",Am I supposed to know who you are?
121,"00:18:00,360","00:18:02,317",I scavenge the high seas.
122,"00:18:03,560","00:18:04,755",You're the Aquaman.
123,"00:18:04,880","00:18:06,792","We were bound to
meet at some point."
124,"00:18:10,960","00:18:12,235",Let's not make it a habit.
125,"00:18:12,920","00:18:13,990",Up.
126,"00:19:08,360","00:19:09,360",Ow.
127,"00:19:22,800","00:19:24,154",Dad!
128,"00:19:26,200","00:19:27,953",Dad? Ow.
129,"00:19:30,560","00:19:31,560",That's your kid?
130,"00:19:36,840","00:19:38,079",Shame on you.
131,"00:19:40,240","00:19:41,919","Boys got yourselves
into this mess."
132,"00:19:41,920","00:19:42,999",Get yourselves out of it.
133,"00:19:43,000","00:19:44,000",Bastard!
134,"00:19:53,560","00:19:54,755",Dad!
135,"00:20:03,200","00:20:04,236",Dad!
136,"00:20:07,280","00:20:08,280",Wait!
137,"00:20:08,760","00:20:10,114",Help me! He's trapped!
138,"00:20:10,320","00:20:11,959",You can't leave him like this!
139,"00:20:13,960","00:20:14,960",Please!
140,"00:20:15,280","00:20:19,399","You killed innocent people.
You ask the sea for mercy."
141,"00:20:33,160","00:20:34,355",Get outta here! I got this!
142,"00:20:34,520","00:20:35,599","Shut up, I'm not leaving you!"
143,"00:20:35,600","00:20:39,913","You need to live,
so you can kill that son of a bitch!"
144,"00:20:43,400","00:20:45,437","Now, go!
No!"
145,"00:20:45,840","00:20:47,274","Go!
Shut up!"
146,"00:20:52,080","00:20:53,080",No!
147,"00:20:53,680","00:20:54,680",No!
148,"00:21:12,640","00:21:14,233",Damn you!
149,"00:21:14,680","00:21:15,680",Go.
150,"00:22:34,440","00:22:35,720",I always know where to find you.
151,"00:22:36,720","00:22:37,949",Old habits.
152,"00:22:47,040","00:22:49,555","Come on, I'll buy you breakfast.
All right!"
153,"00:22:53,080","00:22:55,914","You want me to have them
put that in a sippy cup for you?"
154,"00:22:59,240","00:23:00,840","How is it that I can
breathe underwater,"
155,"00:23:00,960","00:23:02,838","but you can still drink me
under the table?"
156,"00:23:03,480","00:23:06,154",That's my superpower.
157,"00:23:06,280","00:23:07,559",A Russian submarine
158,"00:23:07,560","00:23:09,392","hijacked late last night
by high-tech pirates."
159,"00:23:10,040","00:23:12,191",The same pirates who are suspected
160,"00:23:12,320","00:23:15,079","in connection with the disappearance
of the Navy's highly classified"
161,"00:23:15,080","00:23:17,679",prototype stealth submarine.
162,"00:23:17,680","00:23:20,957","And a further development,
we now have unconfirmed reports"
163,"00:23:21,080","00:23:24,759","that the Metahuman dubbed
by social media as ""The Aquaman"""
164,"00:23:24,760","00:23:26,353","was responsible for
this daring rescue."
165,"00:23:27,480","00:23:28,596",That's not me.
166,"00:23:28,920","00:23:32,436","Bullshit. You're doing it,
aren't you? Huh?"
167,"00:23:33,120","00:23:35,316",What Vulko trained you to do.
168,"00:23:35,440","00:23:39,070","I knew you couldn't
stand on the sidelines forever."
169,"00:23:39,760","00:23:41,513","Your mother
always knew you were special."
170,"00:23:41,640","00:23:42,640",Don't even start.
171,"00:23:42,760","00:23:46,037","She believed you'd be the one
to unite our two worlds."
172,"00:23:46,160","00:23:47,389",Just stop.
173,"00:23:50,880","00:23:54,237","Whatever Atlantis' problems are,
you're bigger than them."
174,"00:23:54,600","00:23:56,114",Atlantis murdered my mother.
175,"00:23:56,640","00:23:57,869",You don't know that for sure.
176,"00:23:58,040","00:23:59,040","Yes, I do."
177,"00:23:59,720","00:24:03,236","They killed her.
For loving you and having me."
178,"00:24:04,000","00:24:05,480",And you know it.
179,"00:24:10,040","00:24:13,078","Son, one day you're gonna
have to stop blaming yourself."
180,"00:24:20,040","00:24:21,076","Hey, buddy."
181,"00:24:22,640","00:24:24,871",You that fish boy from the TV?
182,"00:24:26,160","00:24:27,355","Oh, great."
183,"00:24:33,680","00:24:36,593","It's ""fish man."" What do you want?"
184,"00:24:37,200","00:24:38,919",I'll tell you what I want.
185,"00:24:42,760","00:24:44,353",Could we get a picture with you?
186,"00:24:44,640","00:24:46,393","You're like our local hero, man."
187,"00:24:47,560","00:24:50,871","It would mean a lot.
Just a quick..."
188,"00:24:55,560","00:24:56,676",Whatever.
189,"00:24:56,800","00:24:58,632","All right. Let's do this.
Don't touch me."
190,"00:24:58,760","00:25:00,879","Right, that's exactly right.
I'm gonna go down here."
191,"00:25:00,880","00:25:02,792",There we go. Everybody smile.
192,"00:25:57,000","00:25:59,276","He understands the significance
of this meeting."
193,"00:25:59,840","00:26:01,399",He'll hear you out.
194,"00:26:21,000","00:26:23,071","King Orm.
King Nereus."
195,"00:26:23,480","00:26:26,799","You picked a meeting place too
close to the surface for my liking."
196,"00:26:26,800","00:26:28,560","You don't recognize
the Council of the Kings?"
197,"00:26:29,560","00:26:31,995","In Atlan's time,
when the Seven Kingdoms were one,"
198,"00:26:32,840","00:26:34,991",our ancestors gathered here.
199,"00:26:35,720","00:26:38,076","Atlantis sat here
at the head of the table."
200,"00:26:39,080","00:26:41,834","Xebel, as always, by his side."
201,"00:26:41,960","00:26:43,917",Brine. Fishermen.
202,"00:26:44,080","00:26:45,992","The Deserters and the Trench
had not yet fallen."
203,"00:26:46,120","00:26:48,351","The Lost Nation had
not yet vanished."
204,"00:26:48,480","00:26:51,791","Together, they were the greatest
empire the world had ever seen."
205,"00:26:52,200","00:26:56,956","But now, I sit on Atlan's throne,
shackled by archaic laws and politics."
206,"00:26:57,080","00:26:58,912","While the threat above us
grows undeniably..."
207,"00:26:59,040","00:27:01,157","Violence has always
plagued the surface."
208,"00:27:02,160","00:27:03,514",They will destroy themselves.
209,"00:27:03,680","00:27:06,070",Not before destroying us first.
210,"00:27:06,520","00:27:08,830",We have been hiding long enough.
211,"00:27:09,840","00:27:12,992","The time has come
for Atlantis to rise again."
212,"00:27:13,600","00:27:15,557","We honor you, King Nereus,"
213,"00:27:17,040","00:27:20,431","by inviting Xebel
to be the first kingdom"
214,"00:27:20,560","00:27:22,552",to join King Orm's alliance.
215,"00:27:22,680","00:27:24,592","As if you had a choice, Vulko."
216,"00:27:24,720","00:27:26,552","By law,
you need four of the Seven Kingdoms"
217,"00:27:26,680","00:27:27,750",to ascend and attack.
218,"00:27:27,880","00:27:30,634","The Lost Nation and the Deserters
have long perished."
219,"00:27:30,760","00:27:32,513",The Trench are nothing but animals.
220,"00:27:32,880","00:27:35,475","The Brine will never join you,
and the Fishermen are cowards."
221,"00:27:35,640","00:27:40,431","Without me and my army to convince
them, your plans are stillborn."
222,"00:27:40,560","00:27:42,916",But I know what you really want.
223,"00:27:43,040","00:27:45,475","Once you've obtained
the pledge of the four kingdoms,"
224,"00:27:45,640","00:27:47,199",you will be ordained
225,"00:27:48,360","00:27:49,714",Ocean Master.
226,"00:27:51,280","00:27:52,555",That is merely a title.
227,"00:27:53,280","00:27:55,158","I'm no fool, King Orm."
228,"00:27:55,280","00:27:56,760","As Ocean Master,
you'll be commander"
229,"00:27:56,880","00:27:59,111","of the greatest military might
on this planet."
230,"00:27:59,640","00:28:01,393",I am the natural choice to lead it.
231,"00:28:03,560","00:28:04,710",Are you?
232,"00:28:05,920","00:28:08,479","What about the rumors
that there's another?"
233,"00:28:08,480","00:28:11,279","An Atlantean,
living among the surface."
234,"00:28:12,000","00:28:13,753",One of royal blood.
235,"00:28:14,800","00:28:18,439","You may sit on the throne of Atlantis,
but your claim to it is weak."
236,"00:28:18,440","00:28:20,599","How can you possibly hope
to unite the empire?"
237,"00:28:20,600","00:28:23,672","My mother's bastard
has never even been to Atlantis."
238,"00:28:23,800","00:28:25,079",His loyalty is to the surface.
239,"00:28:35,800","00:28:38,076",Surface-dwellers! To arms!
240,"00:28:59,080","00:29:00,275",Your king is injured!
241,"00:29:59,920","00:30:01,912",I'm not trying to start a war.
242,"00:30:02,840","00:30:04,194",The war has already begun.
243,"00:30:04,760","00:30:07,992","Then it's time we send them
a message they'll hear."
244,"00:30:12,680","00:30:13,959","- I'm good.
- Stop."
245,"00:30:13,960","00:30:15,879","- Here're the keys.
- Thank you."
246,"00:30:15,880","00:30:17,840","Let's go home and
work on your tƒÅ moko. Huh?"
247,"00:30:18,160","00:30:19,599","If your grandpops was still alive,"
248,"00:30:19,600","00:30:21,592","he'd be banging our heads
for not finishing it."
249,"00:30:23,800","00:30:26,235","Yes, he would,
but there is plenty of time for that."
250,"00:30:26,560","00:30:28,950",We got to get you to bed.
251,"00:30:31,440","00:30:32,476",Got it?
252,"00:30:39,480","00:30:40,520",I've been looking for you.
253,"00:30:40,920","00:30:41,920","Oh, no, no, no..."
254,"00:30:42,040","00:30:43,799","I need you to come
with me to Atlantis."
255,"00:30:43,800","00:30:45,599","Listen, I'm gonna
tell you the same thing"
256,"00:30:45,600","00:30:47,120","that I told that
rusty starfish Vulko."
257,"00:30:47,600","00:30:49,639","Except nicer,
because you're a lady."
258,"00:30:49,640","00:30:51,639","No, thank you. I'm not interested."
259,"00:30:51,640","00:30:53,711","You defeated Steppenwolf
and saved Atlantis."
260,"00:30:54,840","00:30:56,399","That had nothing to
do with Atlantis."
261,"00:30:56,400","00:31:00,239","Your half-brother King Orm is about
to declare war upon the surface world."
262,"00:31:00,240","00:31:02,038",Billions will die.
263,"00:31:02,160","00:31:03,435",Your people and mine.
264,"00:31:04,440","00:31:06,079",We must stop him.
265,"00:31:11,000","00:31:12,753",And how do you propose we do that?
266,"00:31:12,880","00:31:16,078","You are
the firstborn son of Queen Atlanna."
267,"00:31:16,200","00:31:18,271",The throne is yours by birthright.
268,"00:31:18,600","00:31:23,470","The only way to stop this war
and save both worlds"
269,"00:31:24,200","00:31:27,113","is for you to take your
rightful place as king."
270,"00:31:30,520","00:31:32,880","You think if I just show up,
Orm's gonna give up the throne?"
271,"00:31:33,720","00:31:36,280","I'm the bastard son of the queen
your people executed."
272,"00:31:36,920","00:31:39,355",Trust me. I am no king.
273,"00:31:39,480","00:31:40,559",I agree.
274,"00:31:40,560","00:31:42,950",That's awesome. Cool.
275,"00:31:43,080","00:31:45,640","But, Vulko seems to
believe in you for some reason,"
276,"00:31:45,760","00:31:46,955",and that's why I'm here.
277,"00:31:47,080","00:31:49,800","Vulko has learned of the location
of the Lost Trident of Atlan."
278,"00:31:50,440","00:31:52,397","Ooh, fairy tales. It's a myth."
279,"00:31:52,520","00:31:53,520",It's not a myth.
280,"00:31:53,680","00:31:56,195","With the Sacred Trident,
the people will listen to you."
281,"00:31:56,320","00:31:59,313","You can then claim your birthright
and dethrone Orm."
282,"00:31:59,440","00:32:02,239","My birthright?
It died with my mother."
283,"00:32:03,240","00:32:05,675","But I promise you this.
If Orm attacks,"
284,"00:32:05,800","00:32:08,759","I will treat him exactly the
same way your people treated her."
285,"00:32:10,160","00:32:11,480",With no mercy.
286,"00:33:09,280","00:33:13,638","That submarine was barely operational,
but it served its purpose."
287,"00:33:13,800","00:33:16,838",One of your kind intervened.
288,"00:33:17,480","00:33:19,437",He is not one of us.
289,"00:33:19,600","00:33:22,195",He killed my father.
290,"00:33:23,160","00:33:25,516",Our transaction has ended.
291,"00:33:29,360","00:33:32,637",Keep the money. I want Aquaman.
292,"00:34:43,600","00:34:44,829",Dad!
293,"00:34:50,160","00:34:51,160",Dad!
294,"00:35:18,760","00:35:19,760",Dad!
295,"00:35:24,440","00:35:25,476",Pops!
296,"00:35:27,160","00:35:28,160",Pops!
297,"00:35:31,440","00:35:33,591","Come on, Pops."
298,"00:35:34,600","00:35:37,115",Come on! He's not breathing.
299,"00:35:37,280","00:35:38,396",Move! Let me help.
300,"00:35:46,080","00:35:47,275","Come on, Pops."
301,"00:35:58,960","00:35:59,960",Come on.
302,"00:36:14,560","00:36:16,153",I don't even know your name.
303,"00:36:16,920","00:36:19,389","It's Princess Y'Mera
Xebella Challa."
304,"00:36:21,280","00:36:22,396",You may call me Mera.
305,"00:36:24,360","00:36:25,760","Thank you, Mera."
306,"00:36:46,960","00:36:48,280",Dear God.
307,"00:36:49,160","00:36:50,719",This was Orm's doing.
308,"00:36:52,720","00:36:54,313",The worst is yet to come.
309,"00:37:02,360","00:37:04,079",There's a flash flood warning here
310,"00:37:04,080","00:37:06,799","that was just extended
for a couple hours."
311,"00:37:06,800","00:37:09,395","Unprecedented sights
from all over the world today."
312,"00:37:09,520","00:37:13,230","We are seeing warships and trash
washed up by massive waves."
313,"00:37:13,360","00:37:16,398","These extraordinary scenes
of coastlines deluged with waste"
314,"00:37:16,520","00:37:19,035","and garbage are taking place
all over the world."
315,"00:37:19,160","00:37:22,239","Decades of pollution
has been thrown back onto land."
316,"00:37:22,240","00:37:23,319","Many are asking the question,"
317,"00:37:23,320","00:37:25,999","""Was this a natural disaster
or something else?"""
318,"00:37:26,000","00:37:27,878",No. This was no natural disaster.
319,"00:37:28,000","00:37:30,359","They threw out our garbage
and our warships."
320,"00:37:30,360","00:37:32,795","This was our first contact
with the people of Atlantis."
321,"00:37:32,920","00:37:35,913","There you go again
with your insane Atlantean theory."
322,"00:37:36,040","00:37:37,879","You have absolutely no
proof, Dr. Shin."
323,"00:37:37,880","00:37:38,880",Open your eyes.
324,"00:37:39,000","00:37:40,798","We already have
an Atlantean living among us,"
325,"00:37:40,920","00:37:42,354",and his name is Aquaman.
326,"00:37:50,080","00:37:51,080",What is it?
327,"00:37:51,840","00:37:55,072","This is the exact spot that Vulko
gave me my first swimming lesson."
328,"00:37:56,240","00:37:59,517","You have to forget all
the teaching of the surface world"
329,"00:37:59,640","00:38:03,919","and go deeper to uncover
your Atlantean instincts."
330,"00:38:04,360","00:38:05,953",But I already know how to swim.
331,"00:38:06,440","00:38:08,113",Not even close.
332,"00:38:11,440","00:38:13,193","Just so we're clear,"
333,"00:38:13,760","00:38:15,558",I'll help you stop this war.
334,"00:38:16,280","00:38:17,839","But then, I'm done."
335,"00:38:18,920","00:38:20,593",Maybe that's for the best.
336,"00:38:41,240","00:38:43,232","The ocean is more than
our life source, Arthur."
337,"00:38:43,360","00:38:44,714",It is who we are.
338,"00:38:44,880","00:38:46,999","Wait, you can talk underwater?"
339,"00:38:47,000","00:38:50,038","I can talk underwater, too!"
340,"00:38:50,360","00:38:51,874",This is awesome!
341,"00:38:52,720","00:38:55,394","Oh, we can do more than just talk."
342,"00:39:01,920","00:39:06,949","Being Atlantean means more than
just being able to breathe water."
343,"00:39:07,080","00:39:11,677","Your body is equipped to survive
the extreme cold and pressure,"
344,"00:39:11,840","00:39:14,275","and your eyes adjust
to see in the dark."
345,"00:39:38,200","00:39:39,475",This is awesome!
346,"00:40:07,480","00:40:10,712","So, Vulko,
when can I meet my mother?"
347,"00:40:13,120","00:40:15,396","Soon, my young prince."
348,"00:40:15,520","00:40:19,560","When you're ready, I'll take you
to Atlantis to meet the queen."
349,"00:40:30,120","00:40:31,713",I hid my ship in here.
350,"00:40:33,800","00:40:35,479","Listen, I'm not
getting in that thing."
351,"00:40:35,480","00:40:37,519","Well, to get where we're going,
you're gonna have to."
352,"00:40:37,520","00:40:39,591","Your fish ship
has been marinating in chum butter."
353,"00:40:39,720","00:40:41,479","I'm gonna come out
smelling like swamp butt."
354,"00:40:41,480","00:40:43,153",That'd be an improvement.
355,"00:40:49,040","00:40:50,599",Yup. Okay.
356,"00:41:51,800","00:41:53,919","What's the point in
having a bridge underwater?"
357,"00:41:53,920","00:41:56,199","The Gateway Bridge is
a remnant of the Old World."
358,"00:41:56,200","00:41:58,080","It's also the only way in or out
of the Capital."
359,"00:41:58,200","00:41:59,599","Why can't they just
go over the walls?"
360,"00:41:59,600","00:42:01,399",Security is impenetrable.
361,"00:42:01,400","00:42:03,079","Even if they did
manage to evade the guards,"
362,"00:42:03,080","00:42:04,719","they'd never get past
the hydro-cannons."
363,"00:42:07,160","00:42:08,753","People try to sneak
in all the time."
364,"00:42:10,360","00:42:11,680","Yeah, right."
365,"00:42:31,920","00:42:33,036",What is this?
366,"00:42:33,160","00:42:34,879",Customs and border control.
367,"00:42:35,800","00:42:38,554","Don't worry.
I have diplomatic clearance."
368,"00:42:46,400","00:42:47,400",Welcome home.
369,"00:43:36,200","00:43:38,396","There's a safe house
down in the Old City."
370,"00:43:38,520","00:43:41,354","The Highborns never
venture to the sea floor."
371,"00:43:41,600","00:43:42,636",We're here.
372,"00:44:11,960","00:44:13,235",What is this?
373,"00:44:13,720","00:44:16,076","We use this air pocket
as an extra layer of precaution."
374,"00:44:16,200","00:44:18,431","Only the Highborns can
breathe water as well as air."
375,"00:44:18,600","00:44:20,193","Plus, it keeps the animals out."
376,"00:44:21,200","00:44:23,032",They get kind of messy.
377,"00:44:25,800","00:44:27,919","Vulko. Here I am, old man."
378,"00:44:27,920","00:44:30,719","After all these years,
you finally get what you wanted."
379,"00:44:33,520","00:44:37,116","Arthur, I wish it was
under better circumstances."
380,"00:44:37,320","00:44:39,357",I can't believe Orm attacked.
381,"00:44:39,480","00:44:40,480",It wasn't an attack.
382,"00:44:40,640","00:44:42,916","Legally, he's not allowed to yet."
383,"00:44:43,040","00:44:46,238","What he did to your surface
warships was merely a warning."
384,"00:44:46,360","00:44:47,396",What provoked it?
385,"00:44:47,960","00:44:51,559","King Orm and your father
were ambushed by the surface."
386,"00:44:51,560","00:44:53,995",By the surface? I don't think so.
387,"00:44:54,120","00:44:55,873","They still think
Atlantis is a fairy tale."
388,"00:44:56,040","00:44:57,520",I was there.
389,"00:44:57,640","00:44:59,552",A surface warship fired at us.
390,"00:44:59,720","00:45:02,474","Now, Xebel sides with Atlantis,"
391,"00:45:02,640","00:45:07,317","giving Orm a fleet big enough to force
the other two kingdoms to join him."
392,"00:45:07,520","00:45:11,594","If we're going to prevent this war,
you must dethrone him now."
393,"00:45:12,000","00:45:14,674","How many times do I have to tell you?
I don't wanna be king."
394,"00:45:15,080","00:45:16,434",You don't understand.
395,"00:45:17,040","00:45:19,679","Once he is named Ocean Master,
it'll be too late."
396,"00:45:19,680","00:45:22,718","The power at his disposal will be
unlike anything you have ever seen."
397,"00:45:23,360","00:45:25,750","I'm from the surface.
No one is gonna take me seriously."
398,"00:45:25,880","00:45:27,239","Okay? I don't even
know where to begin."
399,"00:45:27,240","00:45:29,835","By winning
the hearts and minds of the people"
400,"00:45:29,960","00:45:34,398","by proving to them that you're
worthy, and retrieving this."
401,"00:45:39,280","00:45:40,350",Hmm.
402,"00:45:41,280","00:45:42,794",I already got one of those.
403,"00:45:44,080","00:45:46,276","Not like this one, you don't."
404,"00:45:46,400","00:45:48,357",This is the Lost Trident of Atlan.
405,"00:45:49,000","00:45:50,116","Oh, I know the story."
406,"00:45:50,280","00:45:52,954",It's more than a story. It's real.
407,"00:45:53,920","00:45:57,630","It was forged by the greatest
weapon masters in history."
408,"00:45:58,920","00:46:02,436","Crafted from Poseidon's steel
for King Atlan,"
409,"00:46:03,440","00:46:05,397",the first ruler of Atlantis.
410,"00:46:06,920","00:46:10,709","Legend says the trident was imbued
with the power to command the sea."
411,"00:46:12,200","00:46:13,200",So what happened to it?
412,"00:46:13,400","00:46:17,110","To know that is to go back to
the time before the Great Fall,"
413,"00:46:17,720","00:46:20,838","when King Atlan ruled
over all that was,"
414,"00:46:22,040","00:46:24,475","when the kingdoms of
Atlantis were one."
415,"00:46:27,280","00:46:32,355","It was a time of great prosperity
and technological advancement."
416,"00:46:33,680","00:46:36,036","We had unlocked
the secret of unlimited energy"
417,"00:46:36,200","00:46:39,557","at a time when the rest of the world
still thought the earth was flat."
418,"00:46:42,120","00:46:45,272","But we became too ambitious,"
419,"00:46:45,400","00:46:47,517",too hungry for power.
420,"00:47:04,480","00:47:07,598","The ocean swallowed
us, and Atlantis sank."
421,"00:47:09,560","00:47:12,120","But the very power
that collapsed our civilization"
422,"00:47:12,240","00:47:14,835",also paved the way to our future.
423,"00:47:15,640","00:47:18,519","It gave us the ability
to breathe underwater."
424,"00:47:19,200","00:47:21,476","And so, we evolved."
425,"00:47:22,520","00:47:25,799","Others regressed, became savage."
426,"00:47:26,920","00:47:31,995","And the king lived out the remainder
of his days in self-imposed exile."
427,"00:47:32,880","00:47:36,556","Neither he nor the trident
were ever seen again."
428,"00:47:37,120","00:47:41,000","One of our archeological teams
uncovered this a few months ago."
429,"00:47:41,240","00:47:45,120","It's an ancient recording
dating back to the First Dynasty."
430,"00:47:45,360","00:47:49,070","I believe it contains
Atlan's final message to his people"
431,"00:47:49,200","00:47:51,760","and the whereabouts
of the Sacred Trident."
432,"00:47:52,040","00:47:53,440","So, what does it say?"
433,"00:47:53,560","00:47:56,394","We don't know.
The technology's too old."
434,"00:47:56,560","00:47:59,598","The cylinder bears the markings
of the Deserter Kingdom."
435,"00:48:00,240","00:48:02,800","You must take it there
and retrieve the message."
436,"00:48:03,000","00:48:06,710","The clue to Atlan's final
resting place is inside of this."
437,"00:48:24,280","00:48:27,079","Border Defense.
You are under arrest for illegal entry."
438,"00:48:27,240","00:48:28,240",No!
439,"00:48:30,120","00:48:31,793",You mustn't be seen here!
440,"00:49:27,920","00:49:29,960","I don't suppose you want
to talk about this, do you?"
441,"00:49:34,920","00:49:36,149",Neither do I.
442,"00:50:16,200","00:50:20,797","In the name of His Highness, King
Orm, I place you under arrest."
443,"00:50:41,480","00:50:43,073",Welcome to Atlantis...
444,"00:50:44,320","00:50:45,320",Brother.
445,"00:50:49,920","00:50:52,355","I can't believe
you're finally here."
446,"00:50:54,080","00:50:56,640","I've heard so many
stories about you."
447,"00:51:02,600","00:51:05,672","All these years,
I've been ashamed of my mother"
448,"00:51:05,840","00:51:08,594","for defiling herself
with a surface-dweller."
449,"00:51:10,040","00:51:12,999","Ashamed of the fact that I have
a half-breed brother"
450,"00:51:13,120","00:51:15,840","whose heart
I wanted to run my trident through."
451,"00:51:17,040","00:51:21,034","But now that you're finally here
before me, I must admit..."
452,"00:51:29,040","00:51:30,440",I am conflicted.
453,"00:51:30,680","00:51:35,471","You want conflict, why don't you take
these chains off, little brother?"
454,"00:51:35,640","00:51:37,313",And we'll see who gets run through.
455,"00:51:40,000","00:51:43,630","Yes, I see you've brought
our mother's weapon."
456,"00:51:44,880","00:51:48,476","Is that why you've come here
after all this time?"
457,"00:51:48,640","00:51:49,960",To kill me?
458,"00:51:50,200","00:51:52,715","I came here to stop a maniac
from destroying the world."
459,"00:51:52,920","00:51:53,990",I see.
460,"00:51:55,080","00:51:56,720","And how do you plan
to stop the atrocities"
461,"00:51:56,880","00:51:59,395","that the surface
continues to commit?"
462,"00:52:00,800","00:52:05,238","Because for a century,
they have polluted our waters"
463,"00:52:06,440","00:52:07,669",and poisoned our children.
464,"00:52:08,920","00:52:12,359","And now, their skies burn
and our oceans boil."
465,"00:52:14,760","00:52:18,071","And you've come all this way to
take sides against your own people?"
466,"00:52:18,680","00:52:20,200","There are no sides
in a war like this."
467,"00:52:20,440","00:52:23,159","You have clearly chosen a side and
come here to challenge the throne."
468,"00:52:23,160","00:52:24,913","If that's what it takes
to stop your war."
469,"00:52:27,280","00:52:29,920","Are you invoking
the Combat of the Kings?"
470,"00:52:30,120","00:52:33,318","Call it whatever you want.
I call it an ass-whooping."
471,"00:52:34,480","00:52:36,756","Well then,
perhaps that's how we'll proceed."
472,"00:52:36,920","00:52:38,599","Your Majesty!
Orm, please."
473,"00:52:38,600","00:52:39,600",Don't you see?
474,"00:52:39,760","00:52:41,991","If I defeat the
firstborn son of Atlanna"
475,"00:52:42,160","00:52:44,629","in a formal challenge
in front of everyone,"
476,"00:52:44,760","00:52:49,710","then all Seven Kingdoms will have to
concede that I am the one true king."
477,"00:52:49,880","00:52:53,157","Your Majesty, there is no victory
in defeating the ignorant."
478,"00:52:53,640","00:52:55,120","Your brother is
clearly an imbecile."
479,"00:52:56,960","00:52:59,077","Your Highness,
he doesn't know our ways."
480,"00:52:59,320","00:53:01,232","Then he's about to
get an education."
481,"00:53:02,880","00:53:04,678",Are you officially challenging me?
482,"00:53:04,840","00:53:06,638","Hell yes, I challenge you.
And when I win..."
483,"00:53:06,840","00:53:08,559","If you win,"
484,"00:53:08,760","00:53:12,151","I will cease all immediate action.
The war is over."
485,"00:53:13,000","00:53:14,480",But if I win...
486,"00:53:16,400","00:53:17,400",You're over.
487,"00:53:18,360","00:53:19,360",Let's do it.
488,"00:53:19,520","00:53:20,874",So be it.
489,"00:53:21,560","00:53:24,473","Challenge has been
made, and I accept."
490,"00:53:24,600","00:53:26,398",Prepare him for the Ring of Fire.
491,"00:53:27,200","00:53:30,193",Wait. The ring of what?
492,"00:53:48,600","00:53:52,310","How could you be so foolish
to let Orm bait you into a fight?"
493,"00:53:52,440","00:53:54,955","It seems to me like I just
solved all of our problems."
494,"00:53:55,080","00:53:57,439","I beat him in a battle, war's over,
I get to go home."
495,"00:53:57,440","00:53:59,591","You're a formidable
fighter on land,"
496,"00:53:59,720","00:54:01,951","but here you're out of your
element, literally."
497,"00:54:02,160","00:54:04,800","Orm has spent
his entire life underwater,"
498,"00:54:04,920","00:54:07,310","training to be a warrior,
training to be the best."
499,"00:54:08,520","00:54:10,477","You taught me how to
fight, Cobra Kai."
500,"00:54:10,760","00:54:12,672",Let's see if you remember anything.
501,"00:54:16,600","00:54:17,920","So, what's with the big fork?"
502,"00:54:18,040","00:54:20,509","It's a trident.
Now, defend yourself."
503,"00:54:54,200","00:54:55,316",What the hell is this?
504,"00:54:55,520","00:54:57,955","I'll teach you this move
when you've mastered the trident."
505,"00:55:08,200","00:55:09,316",It's not fair.
506,"00:55:09,520","00:55:11,830","This thing is so big and awkward.
Why can't I use a sword?"
507,"00:55:11,960","00:55:15,715","That's your mother's trident.
A traditional weapon of royalty."
508,"00:55:15,840","00:55:18,150","You'll never be a king
until you've mastered it."
509,"00:55:19,360","00:55:20,959","Why has she never come to see
me, huh?"
510,"00:55:20,960","00:55:22,952","I told you, when you're ready..."
511,"00:55:23,120","00:55:27,114","Stop lying to me!
I've done everything you ever asked."
512,"00:55:27,240","00:55:30,039","And every time I pass a test,
you make up another one."
513,"00:55:30,040","00:55:31,315",When am I gonna be good enough?
514,"00:55:36,200","00:55:37,520",Does she not love me?
515,"00:55:38,280","00:55:40,590","Your mother loved you
more than anything in the world."
516,"00:55:41,600","00:55:45,230","But she had to return to Atlantis
to keep you safe."
517,"00:55:45,400","00:55:48,472","Her marriage to King Orvax
was arranged a long time ago,"
518,"00:55:48,600","00:55:50,319",so she had to marry him...
519,"00:55:50,480","00:55:52,870","And bear him a son, Prince Orm."
520,"00:55:53,800","00:55:56,110","When Orvax
eventually found out about you,"
521,"00:55:56,240","00:55:58,800",he became overwhelmed with jealousy
522,"00:55:58,920","00:56:03,278","and sacrificed her
to the creatures of the Trench."
523,"00:56:06,200","00:56:08,431",Are you saying they executed her?
524,"00:56:09,960","00:56:11,076",Because she had me?
525,"00:56:25,880","00:56:27,109",I remember...
526,"00:56:27,680","00:56:29,080",Everything.
527,"00:56:32,440","00:56:34,557",I have something for you.
528,"00:56:35,320","00:56:37,437",It belonged to my mother.
529,"00:56:38,960","00:56:40,394",Tell me...
530,"00:56:42,320","00:56:45,438","Do you think she would have enjoyed
watching her sons murder each other?"
531,"00:56:47,160","00:56:51,393","I understand your fear
and your reluctance, Mera."
532,"00:56:51,560","00:56:54,871",I truly do. I don't want war...
533,"00:56:55,000","00:56:56,116",Don't patronize me!
534,"00:56:56,240","00:56:57,515",I know you.
535,"00:56:57,680","00:56:59,639","What you're doing
flies in the face of everything"
536,"00:56:59,640","00:57:01,399","that your mother taught us
when we were children."
537,"00:57:01,400","00:57:02,400",If she were here...
538,"00:57:02,560","00:57:06,634","But she's not here, is she?"
539,"00:57:06,760","00:57:09,116","What my mother taught
us was treason."
540,"00:57:10,080","00:57:12,117",Don't follow in her wake.
541,"00:57:13,080","00:57:15,560","All right! So, this is
the big, old ring of fire, huh?"
542,"00:57:16,000","00:57:18,674","How's it work?
I just kick your ass right here?"
543,"00:57:22,440","00:57:23,760",Vulko.
544,"00:57:23,960","00:57:27,636","Will you escort my betrothed
to the royal box?"
545,"00:57:39,200","00:57:40,554","Let's go, Lady Mera."
546,"00:57:46,880","00:57:50,794","Down here, we have a legend
about the Karathen,"
547,"00:57:50,920","00:57:55,676","an ancient sea monster so powerful
that even King Atlan himself feared it."
548,"00:57:55,800","00:57:59,760","So, he imprisoned it
in the depths of the ocean."
549,"00:58:00,320","00:58:04,360","And in that abyss, the creature
bides its time waiting to rise again."
550,"00:58:04,680","00:58:07,559",Atlantis has been lying in wait...
551,"00:58:08,480","00:58:10,119","And now, the beast has awakened."
552,"00:58:17,120","00:58:22,036","There was a time when I wanted
to meet you more than anything."
553,"00:58:23,400","00:58:24,629",Get to know my little brother.
554,"00:58:25,680","00:58:29,913","Let him know that he wasn't alone,
that we were in it together."
555,"00:58:32,840","00:58:35,400","If only I had known what a
dick you would turn out to be."
556,"00:58:38,520","00:58:41,354","You were the reason
our mother was executed."
557,"00:58:42,480","00:58:44,711","And I've hated you
for it ever since."
558,"00:58:47,280","00:58:50,079","But I do not want to kill
you, Arthur."
559,"00:58:50,960","00:58:53,998",I'm going to give you one chance.
560,"00:58:54,840","00:58:56,354",Go home.
561,"00:58:57,280","00:58:59,920",Do not ever come back to Atlantis.
562,"00:59:01,600","00:59:03,990",You are not going to win this.
563,"00:59:04,760","00:59:08,356","A war is coming to the surface
whether you like it or not."
564,"00:59:08,520","00:59:11,797","And I am bringing the wrath
of the seven seas with me."
565,"00:59:13,200","00:59:15,157",You know I can't let that happen.
566,"00:59:16,520","00:59:17,954",I know.
567,"00:59:21,040","00:59:22,394",What the hell is that?
568,"00:59:24,520","00:59:25,874",The Ring of Fire.
569,"00:59:35,080","00:59:36,080",Yeah!
570,"00:59:39,000","00:59:40,673",Yeah!
571,"00:59:47,600","00:59:48,829",Shit.
572,"00:59:50,200","00:59:52,078","People of Atlantis, hear me!"
573,"00:59:53,000","00:59:56,596","My brother has come from the surface
to challenge me for the throne."
574,"00:59:58,520","01:00:01,558","Let us settle his claim
in the ancient way."
575,"01:00:01,800","01:00:06,239","By bloodshed do the gods
make known their will!"
576,"01:00:15,520","01:00:16,954",Traitor!
577,"01:00:17,720","01:00:18,949",Traitor!
578,"01:00:24,520","01:00:26,591",You'll never be king!
579,"01:00:41,240","01:00:42,919","Never thought I'd see the day
when my own father"
580,"01:00:42,920","01:00:44,559","would bow before the
king of Atlantis."
581,"01:00:44,680","01:00:48,560","The surface-dwellers drew first blood.
What would you have us do?"
582,"01:00:48,680","01:00:50,239",Beg them for mercy?
583,"01:00:50,360","01:00:52,670","I detest the surface
as much as you do."
584,"01:00:52,800","01:00:55,713","But don't you find the timing
of all of this a bit convenient?"
585,"01:00:59,440","01:01:03,070","But you wouldn't be that gullible,
would you?"
586,"01:01:05,920","01:01:07,718","You want this war too, don't you?"
587,"01:01:07,840","01:01:10,599","It is past time the surface-dwellers
learned their place in the world."
588,"01:01:10,600","01:01:12,990","If this is how it must be done,
then so be it."
589,"01:01:20,040","01:01:21,315",You have our mother's trident.
590,"01:01:21,560","01:01:24,553","Powerful, but flawed like her."
591,"01:01:25,440","01:01:26,874",I wield my father's.
592,"01:01:28,760","01:01:30,035",And it has never known defeat!
593,"01:02:18,800","01:02:20,996",I promised Atlanna I'd protect him.
594,"01:02:28,520","01:02:31,752","This isn't a competition.
It's an execution."
595,"01:04:28,760","01:04:32,436",I am the one true king!
596,"01:05:16,160","01:05:18,038","You waiting for an invitation?
Get in!"
597,"01:05:28,960","01:05:30,155",Mera!
598,"01:05:33,400","01:05:35,198","Oh, yeah. So, what's the plan?"
599,"01:05:35,320","01:05:38,358","The plan was to recover Atlan's
trident, then challenge Orm."
600,"01:05:38,480","01:05:39,879","Okay, so we're doing things
a little out of order."
601,"01:05:39,880","01:05:40,880",Shit happens.
602,"01:05:46,600","01:05:48,398","Heads up!
We got a bogey on our six!"
603,"01:05:48,520","01:05:50,716","What does that even mean?
Bad guys behind us."
604,"01:05:50,880","01:05:52,951","Then just say that!
Bad guys behind us!"
605,"01:07:01,240","01:07:03,319","Whoa, whoa, wait, you said
we couldn't go over these walls."
606,"01:07:03,320","01:07:05,079","I did!
You said there were hydro-cannons!"
607,"01:07:05,080","01:07:06,150","I did, now shut up!"
608,"01:07:10,800","01:07:12,553","Oh, shit!"
609,"01:07:35,800","01:07:37,234",Shit!
610,"01:07:38,000","01:07:39,036",Shit.
611,"01:07:39,920","01:07:42,674","We're not dead yet!
But I'm hoping he'll think we are."
612,"01:07:44,600","01:07:45,636",Oh!
613,"01:07:52,960","01:07:54,189","Here, hold this."
614,"01:07:56,360","01:07:57,360",What are you doing?
615,"01:07:57,480","01:07:59,517","Listen, it worked for Pinocchio.
Who?"
616,"01:07:59,640","01:08:02,155","Never mind.
Come here, get in. Come on."
617,"01:08:04,360","01:08:06,317","Great.
So we're getting eaten."
618,"01:08:28,200","01:08:29,640","How are you even doing
this, anyway?"
619,"01:08:30,240","01:08:31,515",I don't know.
620,"01:08:32,200","01:08:34,510","I can hear them sometimes,
and they can hear me."
621,"01:08:34,640","01:08:37,599","Right. Because you're both big,
dumb animals."
622,"01:08:37,720","01:08:39,800","Hey, I just saved your life.
I saved yours first!"
623,"01:08:44,520","01:08:46,318","She said, ""Coast is clear."""
624,"01:08:46,520","01:08:48,432","So, where to now?"
625,"01:08:50,000","01:08:53,311","To the ocean of sand
your people call the Sahara."
626,"01:08:54,480","01:08:55,914",All right.
627,"01:09:19,560","01:09:21,153","I don't usually take charters,"
628,"01:09:21,320","01:09:23,200","but I don't usually get paid
in pirate treasure."
629,"01:09:23,760","01:09:24,840","Thanks for the ride, buddy."
630,"01:09:26,840","01:09:28,194","Oh, man."
631,"01:09:28,800","01:09:30,439",Are you okay?
632,"01:09:30,760","01:09:32,752",I've never been so high up before.
633,"01:09:34,680","01:09:36,433",Or so far from home.
634,"01:09:37,680","01:09:39,239",But at least you have a home.
635,"01:09:40,280","01:09:41,316",Not anymore.
636,"01:09:41,920","01:09:43,115",I can never go back.
637,"01:09:43,560","01:09:46,280","I betrayed everything
when I saved you from the coliseum."
638,"01:09:50,640","01:09:53,553","Yeah, but you're engaged to the king.
They have to take you back."
639,"01:09:53,720","01:09:56,679",Atlantis is many wonderful things.
640,"01:09:56,960","01:09:58,633","But forgiving, it is not."
641,"01:09:58,840","01:09:59,876","Yeah, but you're royalty."
642,"01:10:00,000","01:10:01,116",So was your mother.
643,"01:10:02,600","01:10:05,160","If I went back now,
I'd be sacrificed to the Trench."
644,"01:10:05,440","01:10:07,830","Even my own father
wouldn't take me back."
645,"01:10:12,360","01:10:13,999","Look on the bright side,"
646,"01:10:14,160","01:10:16,759","now you don't have to marry some
tool bag that you're not in love with."
647,"01:10:16,760","01:10:19,070",My obligation isn't to love.
648,"01:10:20,000","01:10:21,832","It is to my family and my nation,"
649,"01:10:22,480","01:10:24,312",and I've turned my back on both.
650,"01:10:26,920","01:10:29,674","Sometimes,
you have to do what's right,"
651,"01:10:30,640","01:10:33,314","even if your heart
aches against it."
652,"01:10:49,320","01:10:50,959",Your Highness.
653,"01:10:52,080","01:10:56,711","The tracker places Princess Mera
here, in the Deserter Kingdom."
654,"01:10:57,520","01:10:58,795",You said she was dead.
655,"01:10:59,560","01:11:00,880",Apparently not.
656,"01:11:02,640","01:11:04,119","Then your brother
still lives as well?"
657,"01:11:04,120","01:11:05,156",Not for long.
658,"01:11:05,320","01:11:07,676","Captain Murk,
assemble a strike force immediately."
659,"01:11:07,800","01:11:12,113","No! Mera is to be arrested
and safely returned to me."
660,"01:11:12,240","01:11:13,310",She betrayed the throne.
661,"01:11:13,440","01:11:14,794",She is a daughter of Xebel.
662,"01:11:15,920","01:11:18,799","If any harm befalls her,
our coalition is over."
663,"01:11:18,920","01:11:20,159","Your Highness,"
664,"01:11:20,160","01:11:23,676","we are now entering the waters
of the Fishermen Kingdom."
665,"01:11:23,880","01:11:27,874","Securing the alliance
of the other two kingdoms"
666,"01:11:28,000","01:11:29,878",should be our immediate concern.
667,"01:11:33,280","01:11:37,672",My vizier is correct. As usual.
668,"01:11:39,160","01:11:45,396","Arrest them and bring back
King Nereus' daughter unharmed."
669,"01:12:08,480","01:12:09,880",We're here!
670,"01:12:11,360","01:12:12,719",Hey!
671,"01:12:12,720","01:12:14,234",Is there anything nearby?
672,"01:12:14,360","01:12:16,120","Nothing but desert
for hundreds of K's, mate!"
673,"01:12:16,480","01:12:18,153","- Nothing but desert.
- He's wrong."
674,"01:12:18,560","01:12:21,359","Hey! What are you doing?
Wait! No! Oh..."
675,"01:12:24,240","01:12:26,800","She just jumped!
She didn't have a parachute!"
676,"01:12:27,080","01:12:29,276",Redheads! You got to love 'em.
677,"01:12:44,640","01:12:46,313",Shit!
678,"01:12:59,000","01:13:00,593","Oh, you're crazier than I thought!"
679,"01:13:00,760","01:13:01,796",A-ha!
680,"01:13:03,160","01:13:04,514",This way.
681,"01:13:26,120","01:13:29,318","You were defeated the last time
because your surface weapons failed you."
682,"01:13:30,280","01:13:31,430",Ours will not.
683,"01:13:34,960","01:13:36,235",It's prototype armor
684,"01:13:36,360","01:13:38,670","for the next generation
Atlantean soldier."
685,"01:13:39,440","01:13:42,239","Revenge is something
we Atlanteans understand."
686,"01:13:42,360","01:13:45,478","You will lead my finest commandos
as your personal army"
687,"01:13:45,600","01:13:48,160","to hunt down the
half-breed abomination."
688,"01:13:48,280","01:13:52,559","I cannot touch them, but you can.
He's fled to your world."
689,"01:13:52,680","01:13:55,878","Kill him and the woman he's with,
and you will be rewarded."
690,"01:13:56,000","01:13:58,151",Killing him is my reward.
691,"01:14:01,960","01:14:03,952","The crown jewel.
Still experimental."
692,"01:14:05,920","01:14:08,480","Converts water
into beams of energized plasma."
693,"01:15:20,680","01:15:22,439",Hmm.
694,"01:15:22,440","01:15:24,397","I think I'm gonna
need a bigger helmet."
695,"01:15:25,080","01:15:27,559","One of the tribes of
Atlantis broke off and settled here"
696,"01:15:27,560","01:15:29,597","when this region
was still an inland sea."
697,"01:15:29,720","01:15:32,394","When the water dried up,
they perished along with it."
698,"01:15:32,560","01:15:34,119","Perished? Yeah, that's terrific."
699,"01:15:34,240","01:15:35,276",We're getting close now.
700,"01:15:35,400","01:15:37,756","Oh, yeah? Close to what?
Dying of thirst?"
701,"01:15:37,880","01:15:39,319","Close to getting
punched in the face!"
702,"01:15:39,320","01:15:41,839","Look, Fight Club, I know you're new
to how things work up here."
703,"01:15:41,840","01:15:43,832","Why don't you look around?
We are lost."
704,"01:15:43,960","01:15:45,599","You see that over there?
Hey, what is that?"
705,"01:15:45,600","01:15:47,592",Nada. This place is a wasteland.
706,"01:15:48,400","01:15:50,676","You're the one who calls
this wasteland a home."
707,"01:15:50,800","01:15:52,359",This isn't my home!
708,"01:15:52,600","01:15:54,399","It's not like the whole surface
looks like this!"
709,"01:15:54,400","01:15:55,595","Oh, no, of course not."
710,"01:15:55,720","01:15:59,475","You've also got disgusting cities
whose sewers empty out into our ocean"
711,"01:15:59,600","01:16:01,353","and whole mountains
made out of trash."
712,"01:16:01,480","01:16:02,759","And, oh, you've got great factories"
713,"01:16:02,760","01:16:04,959","that do nothing but belch
out filth and melt ice caps."
714,"01:16:04,960","01:16:06,917",Okay. Point taken. Listen.
715,"01:16:07,080","01:16:08,159","Yeah, we got
some idiots running the show,"
716,"01:16:08,160","01:16:09,799","but we've got
some good things too, all right?"
717,"01:16:09,800","01:16:12,713","We got green forests and big
mountains and beautiful lakes."
718,"01:16:13,000","01:16:15,071","You'd love 'em.
They're like little baby oceans."
719,"01:16:15,520","01:16:16,920",Are you trying to provoke me?
720,"01:16:17,040","01:16:19,199","I'm just saying you cannot judge a
place before you've even seen it."
721,"01:16:19,200","01:16:21,760",You've judged Atlantis on far less.
722,"01:16:25,480","01:16:28,951","No. Would you
just stop it with that? No."
723,"01:16:29,160","01:16:32,551","Your stupid Atlantean GPS just
told you to jump out of an airplane"
724,"01:16:32,680","01:16:34,399","over the middle of the desert,
and now we are stranded."
725,"01:16:38,000","01:16:40,310","If you're the next true
king, we're doomed."
726,"01:17:08,720","01:17:09,870",That was awesome.
727,"01:17:15,320","01:17:17,880",Oh. Look what I found.
728,"01:17:19,120","01:17:20,120",What you found?
729,"01:17:20,280","01:17:21,280",Yeah.
730,"01:17:31,760","01:17:33,399",Check this place out.
731,"01:17:34,160","01:17:35,514",This is badass!
732,"01:17:37,400","01:17:38,993",This is the Hall of Armory.
733,"01:17:40,000","01:17:42,913","Where the legends say
Atlan's trident was forged."
734,"01:17:44,600","01:17:46,512","I don't think
they're legends anymore."
735,"01:17:52,840","01:17:54,115",Vulko was right.
736,"01:17:56,800","01:17:58,075",It's real.
737,"01:18:35,520","01:18:36,556",Huh.
738,"01:18:37,200","01:18:38,554",Nothing.
739,"01:18:39,440","01:18:40,559",Of course it's not working.
740,"01:18:40,560","01:18:43,632","It's been sitting here collecting dust
since before the Sahara was a desert."
741,"01:18:45,880","01:18:47,280",Man!
742,"01:18:47,840","01:18:50,719","""Since before the
Sahara was a desert."""
743,"01:18:50,880","01:18:52,678","Thank you
for repeating what I just said."
744,"01:18:52,840","01:18:54,672",It's completely dried out.
745,"01:18:56,840","01:18:58,319","Let's just say
you do your best thinking"
746,"01:18:58,320","01:19:00,073",when you're not thinking at all.
747,"01:19:00,320","01:19:01,399","All right, now hold still."
748,"01:19:01,400","01:19:03,596",Hey. What are you doing?
749,"01:19:03,720","01:19:06,633","We need water,
and you're the closest source."
750,"01:19:07,680","01:19:09,194","Now, hold still."
751,"01:19:15,360","01:19:16,396",Hmm.
752,"01:19:45,400","01:19:46,550",Show-off.
753,"01:19:47,640","01:19:48,960",I could have just peed on it.
754,"01:19:59,520","01:20:00,715",King Atlan.
755,"01:20:02,960","01:20:07,830","In this trident
resides the power of Atlantis."
756,"01:20:08,120","01:20:11,875","In the wrong hands,
it would bring destruction."
757,"01:20:12,000","01:20:14,231","But in the hands of the true heir,"
758,"01:20:14,360","01:20:17,319","it would unite all our kingdoms
above and below."
759,"01:20:18,480","01:20:23,271","If you seek my power,
you must prove your worth."
760,"01:20:23,400","01:20:26,472","Journey beyond the edge of
the world to the Hidden Sea."
761,"01:20:26,840","01:20:29,639","Look inside the bottle
for the charted path."
762,"01:20:29,800","01:20:35,592","Only in the hands of the true king
can he truly see."
763,"01:20:43,880","01:20:44,996",Hmm.
764,"01:20:51,800","01:20:53,029",We can't let Orm find this.
765,"01:20:55,600","01:20:56,799",Hey! Wait!
766,"01:20:57,920","01:20:58,920",What?
767,"01:20:59,600","01:21:01,239","Shouldn't we have
written it down first?"
768,"01:21:01,360","01:21:03,238",I memorized it. Didn't you?
769,"01:21:05,000","01:21:06,434","Oh, yeah. Totally."
770,"01:21:08,160","01:21:09,276",What'd he just say?
771,"01:21:11,320","01:21:13,312","""Something something trident."""

773,"01:21:36,840","01:21:38,593",It's our next stop.
774,"01:23:12,840","01:23:15,560","I'm starting to think you actually
like these surface-dwellers."
775,"01:23:15,680","01:23:18,115","It would be wrong to judge a place
I've never seen before."
776,"01:23:20,520","01:23:22,876","I'll be right back.
Don't go anywhere."
777,"01:23:42,320","01:23:45,438","Well, apparently, it's just right
up on the hill. A big old castle."
778,"01:23:46,160","01:23:49,319","And I just learned something
very interesting."
779,"01:23:49,320","01:23:50,515",Pinocchio.
780,"01:23:51,280","01:23:54,041","You risked our lives based on something
you read in a children's book?"
781,"01:23:55,560","01:23:58,280","Wait, it's a book?
How about that?"
782,"01:23:58,440","01:23:59,510",Oh!
783,"01:23:59,960","01:24:01,439",I got it from the movie.
784,"01:24:07,080","01:24:10,279","King Nereus, I had
hoped our people had evolved"

786,"01:24:12,600","01:24:14,751","that war with the
surface is inevitable."
787,"01:24:14,880","01:24:17,793",It is the position of the Fishermen
788,"01:24:17,920","01:24:20,879","that when the time comes to make
ourselves known to the landsmen,"
789,"01:24:21,000","01:24:24,596","it should be to educate them,
not to destroy them."
790,"01:24:26,240","01:24:28,675","I admire your lofty aspirations,
King Ricou."
791,"01:24:32,880","01:24:37,477","But I suspect they are but clouds of ink
hiding the heart of a coward."
792,"01:24:37,600","01:24:39,239",How dare you!
793,"01:24:41,880","01:24:43,837",Please. I implore you.
794,"01:24:44,480","01:24:48,110","You're a kingdom of bloated
philosophers and flaccid poets"
795,"01:24:48,240","01:24:51,472","whose waters have grown stagnant,

796,"01:25:00,160","01:25:01,480",My King!

800,"01:25:13,240","01:25:16,392","We move against the Brine Kingdom
at once."
801,"01:25:24,240","01:25:25,993","What did the

808,"01:25:47,400","01:25:48,436",What?
809,"01:25:48,640","01:25:50,677","Wow.
That's awesome."
810,"01:25:50,840","01:25:52,069",Let me see.
811,"01:25:53,520","01:25:55,637","Wow. But how do you know
where to point it?"
812,"01:25:55,760","01:25:57,080","Here, let me see."

861,"01:35:34,640","01:35:36,279",Did you steal a boat?

864,"01:35:42,560","01:35:43,880",Huh.
865,"01:35:46,280","01:35:48,033","Those were
Orm's elite commandos."

869,"01:35:55,360","01:35:57,750",He and his father were pirates.
870,"01:35:59,320","01:36:01,471","And he blames me for
his father's death."
871,"01:36:02,040","01:36:06,273","They picked a dangerous line of trade.
It's not your fault."
872,"01:36:07,320","01:36:08,959",That's not how it feels.
873,"01:36:11,280","01:36:13,920","It was up to me, and I let him die."
874,"01:36:15,240","01:36:16,879","I could've saved him, but I didn't."
875,"01:36:18,360","01:36:21,910","And now, I made an enemy,
and he could have hurt you."
876,"01:36:22,080","01:36:23,440",And that would have been my fault.
877,"01:36:25,560","01:36:27,438","Well, he's behind us now."
878,"01:36:29,000","01:36:31,231","It's what lies ahead
that should concern us."
879,"01:36:33,240","01:36:36,153","The charted path leads
to the Kingdom of the Trench."
880,"01:36:38,200","01:36:40,237","Are those the same creatures
that killed my mother?"
881,"01:36:41,040","01:36:42,156",Yes.
882,"01:36:42,320","01:36:44,516","She was taken there
and sacrificed to them."
883,"01:36:44,640","01:36:46,552",It's become a place of death.
884,"01:36:46,840","01:36:48,832","We know next to nothing
about what's down there."
885,"01:36:53,000","01:36:54,400",We should turn back.
886,"01:36:55,560","01:36:58,079","We can still warn the surface.
Try and prepare them for what's coming."
887,"01:36:58,080","01:36:59,080",Turn back?
888,"01:36:59,240","01:37:02,756","Look, I learned from a young age
not to show weakness."
889,"01:37:03,880","01:37:07,159","Okay? I solve my problems
with my anger and my fists."
890,"01:37:07,160","01:37:09,117","I'm a blunt instrument,
and I'm damn good at it."
891,"01:37:10,160","01:37:13,631","But I've done nothing but get
my ass kicked this whole trip."
892,"01:37:14,480","01:37:17,359",I'm no leader. I'm not a king.
893,"01:37:17,560","01:37:20,120","I do not work or play
well with others."
894,"01:37:21,480","01:37:24,598","And I can't let you die trying
to turn me into something that I'm not."
895,"01:37:26,080","01:37:29,517","You think you're unworthy to lead
because you're of two different worlds."
896,"01:37:30,720","01:37:33,713","But that is exactly
why you are worthy."
897,"01:37:33,880","01:37:36,315","You are the bridge
between land and sea."
898,"01:37:37,560","01:37:39,074",I can see that now.
899,"01:37:40,360","01:37:41,714",The only question is...
900,"01:37:44,400","01:37:45,595",Can you?
901,"01:38:01,200","01:38:04,716","The tracking on Lady Mera

906,"01:38:18,640","01:38:21,712","I have already given it, My King."
907,"01:38:21,840","01:38:24,992","But I will stand by your decision,
as always."
908,"01:38:25,760","01:38:27,194",My decision.
909,"01:38:29,400","01:38:30,629",To protect it.
910,"01:38:33,160","01:38:34,355",While you betray it.
911,"01:38:35,840","01:38:39,277","You think I do not know
of your treachery?"
912,"01:38:39,480","01:38:44,032","That you have remained loyal
to my mother's bastard son."
913,"01:38:44,880","01:38:49,909","That you have spent years training
him to take the throne from me."
914,"01:38:52,920","01:38:54,513",Do not deny it.
915,"01:38:57,680","01:38:58,830",I do not.
916,"01:38:59,360","01:39:00,680",Why?
917,"01:39:02,320","01:39:04,277",I am the pureblood.
918,"01:39:05,160","01:39:07,470",I have devoted my life to Atlantis.
919,"01:39:08,440","01:39:11,559","He wanted nothing to do with it.
You swore to serve the throne!"
920,"01:39:11,560","01:39:12,560",I do serve it.
921,"01:39:12,720","01:39:15,280","Arthur may only be half-Atlantean,"
922,"01:39:15,400","01:39:19,314","but he's already twice the king
you'll ever be."
923,"01:39:25,720","01:39:27,040",Take him.
924,"01:39:28,560","01:39:30,233",But make sure he has a view.
925,"01:41:11,640","01:41:13,199","What the hell
are these things?"
926,"01:41:13,200","01:41:14,998",The Trench! We're here!
927,"01:41:17,640","01:41:19,520","There are too many of them!
Come on, inside!"
928,"01:41:29,920","01:41:30,956",They're from the depths.
929,"01:41:31,080","01:41:32,594",They're scared of the light. Here!
930,"01:41:45,000","01:41:46,275",Come on!
931,"01:41:51,160","01:41:52,355",You ready to jump?
932,"01:43:01,480","01:43:02,994",Over there!
933,"01:43:37,800","01:43:39,280",That thing will tear us apart.
934,"01:43:39,800","01:43:41,359",We don't have a choice!

942,"01:45:55,200","01:45:56,429",Mom?
943,"01:46:35,120","01:46:39,592","King Orvax sacrificed me
to the Trench, but I survived."
944,"01:46:39,760","01:46:42,992","I fought my way through as you did,
and I ended up here."
945,"01:46:43,160","01:46:44,840","You've been here
alone for 20 years?"
946,"01:46:44,960","01:46:46,279",Yes.
947,"01:46:46,280","01:46:47,634",Come. Sit here.
948,"01:46:52,800","01:46:55,110",You must forgive me.
949,"01:46:55,280","01:46:57,237",Forgive me for everything.
950,"01:46:58,080","01:47:00,072",This happened because you had me.
951,"01:47:00,720","01:47:05,078","Not for having you.
None of this is your fault."
952,"01:47:05,560","01:47:08,155",I made a choice. I had to leave...
953,"01:47:08,440","01:47:12,320","To save you, to save your father."
954,"01:47:14,800","01:47:17,269",Tell me. Tell me about him.
955,"01:47:17,800","01:47:19,029",Is he...
956,"01:47:23,040","01:47:25,350","He still walks to
the end of that dock."
957,"01:47:27,160","01:47:28,196",Every morning.
958,"01:47:31,240","01:47:32,560",Every day.
959,"01:47:35,960","01:47:37,314",Waiting for you.
960,"01:47:45,080","01:47:46,514",Why didn't you ever come back?
961,"01:47:52,440","01:47:55,478","Because the portal that brought
you here won't let us return."
962,"01:47:56,480","01:47:59,439",The trident is the only way back.
963,"01:48:00,000","01:48:03,789",But it is guarded by the Karathen.
964,"01:48:06,320","01:48:08,596","The creature from our legends,
it's real."
965,"01:48:08,760","01:48:11,673",It lies beyond the waterfall.
966,"01:48:16,040","01:48:18,199","We'll go with you.
We can fight it together."
967,"01:48:18,200","01:48:19,475",No.
968,"01:48:19,680","01:48:21,273",It's too powerful.
969,"01:48:21,720","01:48:24,030","I've tried many
times over the years."
970,"01:48:25,480","01:48:28,757","The creature will only allow
the true king to pass."
971,"01:48:31,880","01:48:33,439",You're afraid.
972,"01:48:36,120","01:48:37,190",Yes.
973,"01:48:38,840","01:48:39,956",Good.
974,"01:48:41,640","01:48:42,869",You're ready.
975,"01:48:44,480","01:48:46,073","Atlantis has
always had a king."
976,"01:48:48,040","01:48:49,554","Now, it needs something more."
977,"01:48:50,280","01:48:52,192","But what could be
greater than a king?"
978,"01:48:52,800","01:48:53,916",A hero.
979,"01:48:55,880","01:48:58,111",A king fights only for his nation.
980,"01:49:00,080","01:49:02,151",You fight for everyone.
981,"01:50:30,840","01:50:35,198",You do not belong here.
982,"01:50:36,800","01:50:43,070","I have guarded the trident against
false kings since the beginning."
983,"01:50:43,280","01:50:45,556",And for a thousand years
984,"01:50:45,760","01:50:51,279","I have seen the greatest champions
try and fail."
985,"01:50:51,520","01:50:57,756","But never have I sensed one
as unworthy as you."
986,"01:50:58,200","01:51:05,039","You dare come here
with your tainted mongrel blood"
987,"01:51:05,240","01:51:08,551","to claim Atlantis'
greatest treasure?"
988,"01:51:11,040","01:51:12,076",So be it...
989,"01:51:13,600","01:51:15,273",Half-breed.
990,"01:51:34,880","01:51:38,159",You thought yourself worthy?
991,"01:51:38,160","01:51:41,319",You thought yourself a king?
992,"01:51:41,320","01:51:45,200","You dishonor this place
with your presence."
993,"01:51:45,560","01:51:46,710",Stop!
994,"01:51:54,400","01:51:57,677","You're right.
I am a half-breed mongrel."
995,"01:51:59,240","01:52:01,675","But I did not come here
because I thought I was worthy."
996,"01:52:01,920","01:52:03,195",I know I'm not.
997,"01:52:03,800","01:52:07,714",You understand me?
998,"01:52:07,880","01:52:09,314",I do.
999,"01:52:09,840","01:52:16,360","No mortal has conversed with me
since King Atlan."
1000,"01:52:17,480","01:52:20,712",Who are you?
1001,"01:52:21,480","01:52:22,834",I'm nobody.
1002,"01:52:25,320","01:52:27,915",I came because I had no choice.
1003,"01:52:29,760","01:52:33,993","I came to save my home
and the people that I love."
1004,"01:52:36,360","01:52:40,036","I came because the trident
is their only hope."
1005,"01:52:40,520","01:52:42,512",And if that's not good enough...
1006,"01:52:45,040","01:52:46,520",Then screw you.
1007,"01:52:48,680","01:52:55,473","No man has ever freed the trident
from Atlan's grip."
1008,"01:52:56,520","01:52:59,433",Should he deem you unworthy...
1009,"01:52:59,760","01:53:04,999","Well, I haven't feasted in eons,"
1010,"01:53:05,000","01:53:07,993",and I am famished.
1011,"01:54:38,080","01:54:41,039",The one true king.
1012,"01:54:53,720","01:54:56,952","Remember, the Brine
are powerful, savage brutes,"
1013,"01:54:57,160","01:55:01,154","but a swift assault aimed directly
at their leadership will turn the tide."
1014,"01:55:01,320","01:55:02,834","Defeat the Brine King,"
1015,"01:55:03,080","01:55:06,676","and you will command the greatest
military might on this planet."
1016,"01:55:08,760","01:55:10,513","Today, we unite our kingdoms."
1017,"01:55:12,360","01:55:13,874","Tomorrow, we scorch the surface!"
1018,"01:55:15,240","01:55:18,472","Rise, Atlantis!"
1019,"01:55:36,320","01:55:39,711",Death to the Atlantean Hagfish!
1020,"01:55:45,120","01:55:47,316",We will not bow to Atlantis.
1021,"01:55:47,480","01:55:51,633","We're gonna give them a fight
that they will never forget!"
1022,"01:56:58,160","01:57:00,914",No! We need him!
1023,"01:57:03,200","01:57:04,520",Join me or die.
1024,"01:57:04,760","01:57:08,151","You expect me
to address you as Your Highness?"
1025,"01:57:08,400","01:57:09,675",Not Your Highness.
1026,"01:57:11,680","01:57:13,160",Call me...
1027,"01:57:14,040","01:57:15,599",Ocean Master.
1028,"01:57:15,920","01:57:19,596","You can take my army,
you soft-bellied slug."
1029,"01:57:19,800","01:57:22,952","But you will never
have my allegiance!"
1030,"01:57:23,240","01:57:24,310",So be it!
1031,"01:57:56,400","01:57:57,550",What the...
1032,"01:58:32,920","01:58:34,593",The king has risen.
1033,"01:58:42,360","01:58:44,317",Attack!
1034,"02:00:43,480","02:00:46,000","There are too many casualties.
We have to stop the fighting now."
1035,"02:00:46,120","02:00:49,272","I'll find my father.
But you must defeat Orm."
1036,"02:00:50,720","02:00:52,200",And what if I can't?
1037,"02:00:52,400","02:00:54,517","Last time, he was in his element."
1038,"02:00:55,440","02:00:58,478","This time, make him fight in yours."
1039,"02:01:25,600","02:01:26,636",Um...
1040,"02:01:27,800","02:01:30,599","What was the plan, again?
The plan is to not get killed."
1041,"02:01:32,000","02:01:34,390","Yeah, good plan. Don't get killed."
1042,"02:02:07,560","02:02:09,599",The Trench! He commands the Trench!
1043,"02:02:09,600","02:02:11,000",Impossible!
1044,"02:02:28,040","02:02:29,394",Stand down! Let her pass.
1045,"02:02:29,720","02:02:32,679","Please, Father, he has the trident."
1046,"02:02:32,960","02:02:35,156","I know you think this
war is necessary,"
1047,"02:02:35,440","02:02:37,716","but Arthur is king
by our most sacred law."
1048,"02:02:37,880","02:02:39,479","And if you turn your
back on that now,"
1049,"02:02:39,480","02:02:41,756","then the Atlantis you're
fighting for is already dead."
1050,"02:02:42,120","02:02:43,199",It's true!
1051,"02:02:43,200","02:02:44,959","The half-breed wields
King Atlan's trident."
1052,"02:02:44,960","02:02:46,030",He commands the sea!
1053,"02:02:48,320","02:02:50,198",Then that half-breed is your king.
1054,"02:04:07,600","02:04:09,796","Vulko! Come on, he needs our help!"
1055,"02:04:10,000","02:04:11,593",We can't! Look.
1056,"02:04:11,880","02:04:13,394",The people must bear witness.
1057,"02:04:19,840","02:04:21,911","That trident
doesn't change what you are."
1058,"02:04:23,040","02:04:24,440",A half-breed bastard.
1059,"02:04:27,200","02:04:30,398","Atlantis will never accept you
as its king."
1060,"02:04:33,240","02:04:34,469","Well, then by bloodshed..."
1061,"02:04:36,760","02:04:38,558",Do the gods make known their will.
1062,"02:05:08,320","02:05:10,471",Yield the throne. Yield it!
1063,"02:06:46,240","02:06:47,276",Finish it.
1064,"02:06:47,480","02:06:48,630",Yield the throne.
1065,"02:06:48,920","02:06:50,639",Mercy is not our way.
1066,"02:06:52,400","02:06:54,312","Maybe you haven't
noticed, brother..."
1067,"02:06:59,920","02:07:01,400",But I'm not one of you.
1068,"02:07:01,720","02:07:02,790",Do it!
1069,"02:07:05,320","02:07:06,913","- Kill me!
- No!"
1070,"02:07:09,880","02:07:11,473",That is enough killing.
1071,"02:07:19,080","02:07:20,309",Mother?
1072,"02:07:20,960","02:07:22,553","Oh, my son."
1073,"02:07:31,720","02:07:33,279",It's a long story.
1074,"02:07:33,880","02:07:35,314",I'll tell ya later.
1075,"02:07:36,280","02:07:37,600",Come on!
1076,"02:07:44,280","02:07:47,034",I don't understand. We thought...
1077,"02:07:47,240","02:07:48,240",I know.
1078,"02:07:48,960","02:07:50,713",Arthur saved me.
1079,"02:07:54,600","02:07:56,671","You're with him?
I am."
1080,"02:07:59,400","02:08:03,679","You're both my children,
and I love you so much."
1081,"02:08:04,520","02:08:06,557",But you have been misguided.
1082,"02:08:08,280","02:08:11,956","Your father taught you
that there were two worlds."
1083,"02:08:12,120","02:08:13,474",He was wrong.
1084,"02:08:13,920","02:08:16,594",The land and the sea
1085,"02:08:18,000","02:08:19,400",are one.
1086,"02:08:39,360","02:08:40,555",My queen.
1087,"02:08:43,680","02:08:44,875",Vulko.
1088,"02:08:47,280","02:08:48,475",Take him.
1089,"02:08:49,280","02:08:51,431",But make sure he has a view.
1090,"02:08:58,440","02:08:59,440","When you're ready,"
1091,"02:09:01,960","02:09:03,189",let's talk.
1092,"02:09:18,240","02:09:21,995","People of Atlantis,
today began in bloodshed,"
1093,"02:09:22,160","02:09:24,152",but let it end in joy.
1094,"02:09:25,120","02:09:29,160",I give you King Arthur of Atlantis.
1095,"02:09:29,560","02:09:31,279",Hail to the king!
1096,"02:09:31,440","02:09:33,955","- Hail to the king!
- Hail to the king!"
1097,"02:09:42,520","02:09:44,671","So, what do I do now?"
1098,"02:09:45,440","02:09:46,954",Be their king.
1099,"02:09:48,200","02:09:49,350",Ooh.
1100,"02:09:49,640","02:09:51,791",This is gonna be fun.
1101,"02:10:43,800","02:10:46,395",You came back. You're back.
1102,"02:10:46,680","02:10:48,797",Yes. Yes.
1103,"02:10:54,880","02:10:57,520","My father was
a lighthouse keeper."
1104,"02:10:58,520","02:11:00,352",My mother was a queen.
1105,"02:11:02,240","02:11:03,674",They were never meant to meet...
1106,"02:11:07,320","02:11:09,551",But their love saved the world.
1107,"02:11:11,840","02:11:13,752",They made me what I am.
1108,"02:11:14,560","02:11:17,951","A son of the land,
and a king of the seas."
1109,"02:11:19,920","02:11:21,718",I am the protector of the deep.
1110,"02:11:23,440","02:11:24,556",I am...
1111,"02:11:26,360","02:11:28,079",Aquaman.
1112,"02:14:37,280","02:14:38,280",Hey!
1113,"02:14:42,520","02:14:43,795",I spent 15 years
1114,"02:14:44,080","02:14:46,470","at the United States Institute
of Marine Science..."
1115,"02:14:46,680","02:14:49,718","Weren't you fired?
...studying oceanic phenomenon,"
1116,"02:14:49,880","02:14:52,156","and this is the most conclusive
evidence we have to date."
1117,"02:14:52,320","02:14:55,631","Deep-sea seismographs have recorded
explosions on the ocean floor."
1118,"02:14:55,800","02:14:57,479",DR. - We have satellite imagery
1119,"02:14:57,480","02:15:00,075","of debris from Atlantean warships
floating on the surface..."
1120,"02:15:00,240","02:15:01,999","Dr. Shin!
Will you please let me finish?"
1121,"02:15:02,000","02:15:03,753","Here we go again.
Atlantean?"
1122,"02:15:04,320","02:15:06,789","Yes. The government
does not want us to know"
1123,"02:15:07,000","02:15:08,479","about the threat
that exists right here..."
1124,"02:15:08,480","02:15:10,278","Yeah, I wouldn't do
that if I were you."
1125,"02:15:23,200","02:15:24,839","This is Atlantean
technology, isn't it?"
1126,"02:15:25,120","02:15:26,873",Can you tell me how you got this?
1127,"02:15:27,040","02:15:29,760","Sure. But first,"
1128,"02:15:30,480","02:15:33,200",you got to tell me how to find him.
