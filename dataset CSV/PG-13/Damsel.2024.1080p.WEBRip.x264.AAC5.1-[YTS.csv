1,"00:00:21,958","00:00:24,875",There are many stories of chivalry
2,"00:00:24,958","00:00:28,291","where the heroic knight
saves the damsel in distress."
3,"00:00:29,958","00:00:32,958",This is not one of them.
4,"00:01:05,666","00:01:07,041",There it is.
5,"00:01:07,833","00:01:09,291",Form up!
6,"00:01:11,625","00:01:13,375",Let's kill the beast.
7,"00:01:13,458","00:01:15,875",For glory! Hyah!
8,"00:01:30,458","00:01:31,458",Be on guard.
9,"00:02:12,333","00:02:13,333",Form the line!
10,"00:02:44,958","00:02:45,958",Hold!
11,"00:03:45,375","00:03:46,750",The last I could find.
12,"00:03:47,333","00:03:49,916","Did you take the tapestries
into town like Father asked?"
13,"00:03:50,000","00:03:51,333",This morning.
14,"00:03:51,416","00:03:54,541","We should take the furs too,
and the drapes."
15,"00:03:54,625","00:03:55,541",Not the drapes!
16,"00:03:55,625","00:03:57,916",You hate that pattern in your room anyway.
17,"00:03:58,000","00:03:59,625",They serve a purpose.
18,"00:03:59,708","00:04:02,541","Floria, our people are freezing."
19,"00:04:02,625","00:04:03,625",And starving.
20,"00:04:10,375","00:04:11,791",Who'd come this far north?
21,"00:04:20,000","00:04:22,125","Elodie, why are they leaving?"
22,"00:04:22,208","00:04:24,333","There's nothing left
for them here, Floria."
23,"00:04:28,791","00:04:30,875","I don't have enough.
Please, I'm hungry."
24,"00:04:30,958","00:04:32,416","For food, join the line!"
25,"00:04:32,500","00:04:34,541","- Keep to one side.
- I'm starving."
26,"00:04:35,083","00:04:36,083",All right then.
27,"00:04:37,333","00:04:38,708",Get off! It's mine!
28,"00:04:38,791","00:04:41,833","- Hey! Give me back my food.
- Get off of me, old man!"
29,"00:04:41,916","00:04:43,000",You've had enough!
30,"00:04:43,083","00:04:45,291","Share this
with your sister. Go on."
31,"00:04:45,375","00:04:47,750","- Could you see who it was?
- A stranger, my lady."
32,"00:04:47,833","00:04:50,083","They may take
whatever wood they can carry."
33,"00:04:50,166","00:04:51,625","- I'll see to it.
- Come on, Flor."
34,"00:04:51,708","00:04:53,148","- Move on.
- Yes."
35,"00:04:53,208","00:04:54,728","- Get in line.
- Give it to me."
36,"00:04:55,333","00:04:57,666","- I want to meet her first.
- Father?"
37,"00:05:01,875","00:05:03,250",You must be Elodie.
38,"00:05:03,833","00:05:04,833",I am.
39,"00:05:18,875","00:05:19,875",She will do.
40,"00:05:26,208","00:05:29,541","- We await your decision.
- Thank you, Your Holiness."
41,"00:05:31,333","00:05:32,333","Please, this way."
42,"00:05:35,500","00:05:37,250","Father, what's happening?"
43,"00:05:38,333","00:05:39,333",Who is that?
44,"00:05:42,166","00:05:43,166",Stepmother?
45,"00:05:45,708","00:05:46,750","Well, what is it?"
46,"00:05:47,500","00:05:49,291",From the Queen of Aurea.
47,"00:05:53,125","00:05:54,125",A proposal.
48,"00:05:54,208","00:05:56,250","- Oh, my goodness.
- Huh..."
49,"00:05:57,333","00:05:59,500","- I have made a match.
- May I?"
50,"00:05:59,583","00:06:00,791",Uh-huh.
51,"00:06:01,958","00:06:03,041",He is a prince.
52,"00:06:03,875","00:06:04,875",A prince?
53,"00:06:06,000","00:06:08,875","I know you've always wished to travel,
as did your mother."
54,"00:06:09,666","00:06:12,125",Go. See the world.
55,"00:06:12,208","00:06:16,291","This man, he has a fleet of ships,
carriages full of gold."
56,"00:06:16,875","00:06:18,666",That's no reason to marry.
57,"00:06:19,833","00:06:21,041",We need this.
58,"00:06:22,083","00:06:23,916",Our stores are empty.
59,"00:06:24,000","00:06:26,041",We will not make it to the thaw.
60,"00:06:28,208","00:06:29,583",Your people need you.
61,"00:06:31,291","00:06:32,291",Hey.
62,"00:06:34,916","00:06:36,208",This is who we are.
63,"00:06:48,625","00:06:50,000",Get to the port side.
64,"00:06:50,625","00:06:51,791",Port side.
65,"00:06:57,166","00:06:59,625","Elodie, what's the matter?"
66,"00:07:00,541","00:07:01,541",Nothing.
67,"00:07:04,750","00:07:06,416",Father says it's natural to be nervous
68,"00:07:06,500","00:07:08,666","about meeting
your new husband and his family."
69,"00:07:09,583","00:07:10,791",They're strangers.
70,"00:07:11,375","00:07:15,000","I've never heard of the Kingdom of Aurea
until Father sprang this on me."
71,"00:07:15,083","00:07:16,250",Mind the lines.
72,"00:07:16,791","00:07:17,791",Oh!
73,"00:07:18,875","00:07:22,333","Are you crazy?
What are you two doing up there?"
74,"00:07:22,916","00:07:24,041",Come down here.
75,"00:07:25,041","00:07:26,166",Come on.
76,"00:07:30,291","00:07:32,833","This is how you
want your prince to meet you?"
77,"00:07:32,916","00:07:34,958","Scared, cold as a corpse."
78,"00:07:35,041","00:07:37,208",Nose all drippy and wet.
79,"00:07:37,291","00:07:40,666","What have I been
telling you this entire trip?"
80,"00:07:41,166","00:07:43,583","- First impressions are everything.
- Hmm."
81,"00:07:43,666","00:07:45,000","Come on, lift up."
82,"00:07:52,916","00:07:54,125",Look at that.
83,"00:08:06,666","00:08:08,750","I have good news, girls."
84,"00:08:08,833","00:08:12,083","The captain informs me
we approach Aurea's coastline."
85,"00:08:13,291","00:08:15,083",It should be any time now.
86,"00:08:25,041","00:08:26,291",Father.
87,"00:08:29,083","00:08:30,875",What in the world?
88,"00:08:33,541","00:08:36,291",Looks almost... almost like a...
89,"00:08:36,375","00:08:37,458",A dragon.
90,"00:09:07,125","00:09:09,291",It's okay.
91,"00:09:48,666","00:09:51,708","\an8Oh, my heavens."
92,"00:10:35,791","00:10:36,958",\an8It's magnificent.
93,"00:10:37,708","00:10:40,500","\an8My lords, my ladies,"
94,"00:10:40,583","00:10:43,125",\an8be welcome to the Kingdom of Aurea.
95,"00:10:43,666","00:10:45,958","\an8The royal family is at prayer,"
96,"00:10:46,041","00:10:48,208","\an8but word has been sent
of your arrival."
97,"00:10:48,291","00:10:51,041","In the meantime,
your rooms have been made ready."
98,"00:10:51,666","00:10:53,000",If you will follow me.
99,"00:10:55,208","00:10:56,333",\an8Is this a dream?
100,"00:10:57,250","00:11:00,291","\an8If so, can I move in
and never wake up?"
101,"00:11:01,916","00:11:04,916","\an8If you want these people
to think we belong here,"
102,"00:11:05,000","00:11:08,166",\an8you can't act so easily impressed.
103,"00:11:08,666","00:11:11,000","\an8What do you think, Ellie? Hmm?"
104,"00:11:11,083","00:11:14,083","\an8I think I had
a rather limited definition of wealthy."
105,"00:11:35,416","00:11:38,458","I pray this is to your liking, my lady."
106,"00:11:39,541","00:11:41,125",A bath has been drawn
107,"00:11:41,916","00:11:43,916",and supper has been carried hence.
108,"00:11:45,791","00:11:48,541","At first light,
I shall return to convey you"
109,"00:11:49,083","00:11:50,666",to meet His Royal Highness.
110,"00:11:51,250","00:11:53,250","Henry, Prince of Aurea."
111,"00:11:55,250","00:11:57,458","Floria,
stop touching everything."
112,"00:12:00,583","00:12:01,791",Is something wrong?
113,"00:12:02,708","00:12:05,250","- I just hope he's kind.
- Hmm."
114,"00:12:05,333","00:12:06,500","- And well-read.
- Yeah."
115,"00:12:07,083","00:12:08,083",Handsome.
116,"00:12:10,541","00:12:13,333",Let's all give Elodie some privacy.
117,"00:12:13,416","00:12:16,708","She can use the time
to settle in, as we all could."
118,"00:12:16,791","00:12:18,000","Oh, indeed."
119,"00:12:18,916","00:12:19,916",Come.
120,"00:13:15,250","00:13:16,375",M'lady.
121,"00:13:17,291","00:13:18,666",Everyone's waiting.
122,"00:14:31,500","00:14:32,500",Ellie?
123,"00:14:35,166","00:14:36,625",I can't sleep.
124,"00:14:41,875","00:14:44,375","I still can't believe
you're going to live here from now on."
125,"00:14:45,208","00:14:46,416",You and me both.
126,"00:14:47,708","00:14:50,125","I keep thinking,
if only Mother were alive,"
127,"00:14:51,208","00:14:53,583","I could just
talk to her about all of this."
128,"00:14:55,291","00:14:57,166",Perhaps you could talk to Stepmother.
129,"00:14:58,083","00:15:01,333","She means well, even if she is a bit..."
130,"00:15:01,416","00:15:04,125",Exhausting?
131,"00:15:06,333","00:15:09,333",It'll be fine. You'll see.
132,"00:15:10,750","00:15:13,375",You're Elodie. You can do anything.
133,"00:15:16,458","00:15:18,458",What is your greatest strength?
134,"00:15:20,041","00:15:22,000","I always tell the truth,
Your Majesty."
135,"00:15:22,708","00:15:25,708",Some might call that a weakness.
136,"00:15:26,875","00:15:28,166",Do you know your heart?
137,"00:15:28,916","00:15:30,833","I believe I do, Your Majesty."
138,"00:15:30,916","00:15:33,041",And what is it telling you now?
139,"00:15:33,125","00:15:37,125","In truth, it is beating too loudly for me
to hear much of anything, Your Majesty."
140,"00:15:38,166","00:15:39,625","Arise, Elodie."
141,"00:15:47,916","00:15:49,000",I'm Henry.
142,"00:15:50,416","00:15:52,416","Very pleased to finally meet you, my lady."
143,"00:15:53,416","00:15:54,416",We all are.
144,"00:15:55,708","00:15:58,041",My son understates our joy.
145,"00:15:58,916","00:16:00,125","And if I may say so,"
146,"00:16:00,708","00:16:03,291",your father has understated your beauty.
147,"00:16:03,875","00:16:07,500","I've never known my father to understate
much of anything, Your Majesty."
148,"00:16:07,583","00:16:09,666","I see she arrives
with some wit."
149,"00:16:09,750","00:16:13,083","Should you want it or not, Your Majesty."
150,"00:16:13,166","00:16:14,625",And you must be Floria.
151,"00:16:16,416","00:16:19,666","It seems even a harsh clime
can grow the fairest flowers."
152,"00:16:19,750","00:16:21,583",I love your castle.
153,"00:16:21,666","00:16:24,041","I mean, I really love it."
154,"00:16:24,125","00:16:25,125","Like, a lot..."
155,"00:16:27,041","00:16:28,041",Your Majesty.
156,"00:16:28,458","00:16:30,458","You are to make yourself at home, child."
157,"00:16:30,541","00:16:35,208","We elders have some trivial matters
like weddings to attend to."
158,"00:16:35,291","00:16:36,291",Yes...
159,"00:16:36,875","00:16:40,291","Your correspondence
made mention of some particulars"
160,"00:16:40,375","00:16:42,416",you wish to discuss in person.
161,"00:16:42,916","00:16:45,333","- The two of us can confer in private.
- Yes."
162,"00:16:45,416","00:16:47,625","It's nothing to bore
our young people with."
163,"00:16:48,916","00:16:50,958","They have a far more
important task at hand."
164,"00:16:52,125","00:16:53,958",They must get to know each other.
165,"00:17:07,125","00:17:09,125",Do you have any questions of me?
166,"00:17:10,791","00:17:12,375",Questions of what subject?
167,"00:17:12,958","00:17:14,458",You may choose the subject.
168,"00:17:17,333","00:17:18,708",What do you think about me?
169,"00:17:20,208","00:17:21,208",Pardon?
170,"00:17:22,333","00:17:25,625","Well, you seem disinterested at best,
which is your prerogative,"
171,"00:17:25,708","00:17:28,416","but I'd like to know if the person
I'm being guilted into marrying"
172,"00:17:28,500","00:17:29,875",truly likes me or not.
173,"00:17:32,583","00:17:35,541","If my attitude offends you,
I do apologize. It was not my intent."
174,"00:17:38,833","00:17:43,750","However, I was unaware that, um,
you were being guilted into anything."
175,"00:17:46,041","00:17:49,916","The land where I come from
is exactly how your mother explained."
176,"00:17:51,000","00:17:53,125",Harsh and barren.
177,"00:17:54,500","00:17:56,083",This union will save us.
178,"00:17:56,166","00:17:57,708",I've made my peace with it.
179,"00:17:58,583","00:18:02,000","My happiness is a small price to pay
for the future of my people."
180,"00:18:05,791","00:18:06,791",Is something wrong?
181,"00:18:09,375","00:18:10,375",It's just...
182,"00:18:11,875","00:18:15,750","In the letter you sent in advance
of your arrival, you sounded different."
183,"00:18:15,833","00:18:18,541",Different. In what way?
184,"00:18:19,500","00:18:20,625","Far more, um..."
185,"00:18:22,791","00:18:23,791",flowery.
186,"00:18:25,583","00:18:29,458","Maybe that's because
my stepmother dictated most of it"
187,"00:18:29,541","00:18:32,958",and my sister's idea was the heart...
188,"00:18:33,666","00:18:35,458","- The heart.
- Mmm."
189,"00:18:35,541","00:18:38,041","I thought it was
some sort of provincial insignia."
190,"00:18:41,458","00:18:42,708",You actually drew this?
191,"00:18:46,333","00:18:48,083","Hold on. It's a maze, isn't it?"
192,"00:18:48,166","00:18:50,041","""I hope you'll get to know my heart."""
193,"00:18:50,125","00:18:51,625",That is very clever.
194,"00:18:53,583","00:18:56,125","I used to make them
for Floria when she was little."
195,"00:18:57,083","00:18:59,583","- May I ask you another question?
- Certainly."
196,"00:19:00,458","00:19:02,333",Do they always follow you so closely?
197,"00:19:04,625","00:19:06,208",This is them giving me space.
198,"00:19:07,833","00:19:08,875",That must be tiring.
199,"00:19:09,875","00:19:11,458","It is, actually."
200,"00:19:13,916","00:19:17,541","I saw some horses
being left unattended at the stables."
201,"00:19:21,458","00:19:22,458",Do you ride?
202,"00:19:39,583","00:19:40,583",Hyah!
203,"00:19:52,291","00:19:55,416","- Where did you learn to ride like that?
- My mother."
204,"00:19:56,625","00:19:58,125",Which way now?
205,"00:19:58,208","00:20:00,291","Well, depends on what you want to see."
206,"00:20:01,250","00:20:02,250",Everything.
207,"00:20:03,375","00:20:04,583",Very well.
208,"00:20:20,375","00:20:21,750",What happened in there?
209,"00:20:23,958","00:20:24,958",Speak already.
210,"00:20:25,750","00:20:28,166","- Is the wedding still on?
- Aye."
211,"00:20:28,875","00:20:31,583",You settled on a fair bride price?
212,"00:20:31,666","00:20:34,125",More gold than I could ever imagine.
213,"00:20:38,625","00:20:40,291",Then why do you look so?
214,"00:20:40,375","00:20:41,958","No, it's nothing. I'm fine."
215,"00:20:43,958","00:20:46,500","Tell me, you didn't say anything
to embarrass us."
216,"00:20:46,583","00:20:48,041","No, I did not."
217,"00:20:48,125","00:20:51,958","Because it's very important
that our two families get along."
218,"00:20:52,041","00:20:54,250","Not only for Elodie's sake, but for ours."
219,"00:20:54,333","00:20:56,875","I said, nothing! Nothing's wrong."
220,"00:21:00,833","00:21:04,333","I saw something,
high on the mountain last night."
221,"00:21:04,958","00:21:05,958",Torches.
222,"00:21:07,875","00:21:09,166",You saw that?
223,"00:21:09,250","00:21:10,416",I couldn't sleep.
224,"00:21:12,708","00:21:14,125",It was an ancient ceremony.
225,"00:21:15,041","00:21:17,000","Or rather, one of three."
226,"00:21:17,625","00:21:19,541",They're very significant to my family.
227,"00:21:20,166","00:21:22,250","For our whole kingdom, really. They, um..."
228,"00:21:23,916","00:21:25,625",They honor our ancestors.
229,"00:21:27,625","00:21:30,333","That's why my mother
chose these dates for our wedding."
230,"00:21:31,291","00:21:32,708",It is quite beautiful.
231,"00:21:33,625","00:21:34,833","Yes, I suppose."
232,"00:21:35,916","00:21:38,416","I really don't have
anything else to compare it to."
233,"00:21:39,458","00:21:41,125",May I confide in you something?
234,"00:21:42,083","00:21:43,083",Yes.
235,"00:21:43,125","00:21:45,791",My greatest wish is to go see the world.
236,"00:21:47,375","00:21:50,583","Really set out and see it, you know?"
237,"00:21:51,250","00:21:52,375","I do, actually."
238,"00:21:53,583","00:21:54,833",It's my life's dream.
239,"00:21:57,333","00:22:01,708","For as long as I can remember,
I've longed to explore the distant lands."
240,"00:22:02,541","00:22:04,208",The ones you only read about.
241,"00:22:08,291","00:22:10,166","Perhaps, one day, we will."
242,"00:22:12,208","00:22:13,291",Perhaps.
243,"00:22:27,375","00:22:29,458",And the orange in this area.
244,"00:22:33,125","00:22:36,000","Everything's so beautiful, Your Majesty."
245,"00:22:36,083","00:22:37,666","Well, I'm glad you approve."
246,"00:22:38,750","00:22:40,125",Very elegant.
247,"00:22:42,541","00:22:44,750",You have impeccable taste.
248,"00:22:45,750","00:22:49,333",Everything is just so exquisite.
249,"00:22:49,416","00:22:52,166","I'm sorry, is there something
I can help you with?"
250,"00:22:52,833","00:22:55,750","I just thought
we might become better acquainted,"
251,"00:22:56,458","00:22:58,708",seeing as we're about to be family.
252,"00:22:58,791","00:23:02,333","Ah, this must be very exciting for you."
253,"00:23:02,416","00:23:05,416","Your father was a rope maker, was he not?"
254,"00:23:05,500","00:23:07,208",The finest in the city.
255,"00:23:07,291","00:23:09,958",And here you are. You've climbed so high.
256,"00:23:11,041","00:23:14,000","Still, one mustn't forget one's station."
257,"00:23:14,916","00:23:16,875",Nor place undue import
258,"00:23:16,958","00:23:20,708","on what is ultimately
a transaction born of necessity."
259,"00:23:21,791","00:23:24,000","Uh... ""Necessity""?"
260,"00:23:24,583","00:23:26,208","Well, your family needs money."
261,"00:23:26,875","00:23:28,458",My family needs a bride.
262,"00:23:29,166","00:23:31,791",What we don't need is more family.
263,"00:23:33,291","00:23:35,583",I wish all the best for Henry and Eloise.
264,"00:23:35,666","00:23:37,000","- I merely...
- Elodie."
265,"00:23:37,500","00:23:38,500",Pardon?
266,"00:23:40,291","00:23:43,416",My stepdaughter. Her name is Elodie.
267,"00:23:44,916","00:23:46,000",That's what I said.
268,"00:23:46,958","00:23:48,291","Good day, Lady Bayford."
269,"00:24:05,416","00:24:06,416",It's perfect.
270,"00:24:07,166","00:24:08,833",Everything in here is so perfect.
271,"00:24:13,125","00:24:14,125",Stepmother.
272,"00:24:15,875","00:24:17,250",Is something the matter?
273,"00:24:18,708","00:24:19,708","Elodie,"
274,"00:24:20,750","00:24:23,041","I know we haven't always been close,"
275,"00:24:23,750","00:24:25,791",but I need you to listen to me now.
276,"00:24:26,541","00:24:29,625",This wedding... is a mistake.
277,"00:24:29,708","00:24:30,708",What?
278,"00:24:33,125","00:24:34,458",I don't understand.
279,"00:24:34,541","00:24:36,958","These people, I don't trust them."
280,"00:24:37,541","00:24:41,041","It's hard to explain,
but a mother knows these things."
281,"00:24:41,125","00:24:43,250","Only yesterday,
you were enamored by this place."
282,"00:24:43,333","00:24:44,333",Floria.
283,"00:24:44,375","00:24:45,458",I was wrong.
284,"00:24:46,625","00:24:50,750","They may be royalty,
but that doesn't make them good people."
285,"00:24:52,166","00:24:53,166",Well...
286,"00:24:54,125","00:24:57,208","- What does Father think?
- He refuses to talk about it."
287,"00:24:57,291","00:25:01,458","And when I try to tell him my worries,
he snaps at me."
288,"00:25:01,541","00:25:04,250","- Because you're being unreasonable.
- That's enough, Flor."
289,"00:25:04,833","00:25:10,000","Elodie, I swear that I only want
what's best for you."
290,"00:25:15,291","00:25:17,000",Am I interrupting something?
291,"00:25:18,708","00:25:19,750",No.
292,"00:25:20,666","00:25:21,666",Just...
293,"00:25:23,958","00:25:25,000",girl talk.
294,"00:25:26,166","00:25:30,416","Well, tomorrow's a big day,
and these girls, they need their rest."
295,"00:25:33,208","00:25:36,125","Think about what I said.
There's still time."
296,"00:25:36,708","00:25:37,708",Time for what?
297,"00:25:44,625","00:25:47,041","I hope you know
what you're doing."
298,"00:25:52,500","00:25:53,916","Good night, my angels."
299,"00:25:55,000","00:25:56,708","- Good night, Father.
- Good night, Father."
300,"00:25:58,916","00:25:59,916",Good night.
301,"00:27:34,208","00:27:35,208",Wow.
302,"00:28:10,916","00:28:12,583",You may kiss the bride.
303,"00:28:29,500","00:28:33,458","I present my son and new daughter,
Elodie, Princess of Aurea."
304,"00:28:57,833","00:28:59,166","Goodbye, Father."
305,"00:29:22,125","00:29:24,833","I hope I'm half as beautiful
someday as you are today."
306,"00:29:26,833","00:29:28,250",Twice as beautiful.
307,"00:29:31,041","00:29:33,291","- I love you.
- I love you."
308,"00:29:49,208","00:29:53,750","Hey! Hey, hey!"
309,"00:29:57,875","00:29:59,125",Where are we going?
310,"00:29:59,208","00:30:02,416","Remember I told you about those
ancient ceremonies up on the mountain?"
311,"00:30:02,500","00:30:03,333",Yes.
312,"00:30:03,416","00:30:06,333","We're going to pay homage
to my ancestors."
313,"00:31:00,000","00:31:01,666","Welcome, Princess."
314,"00:31:02,541","00:31:06,083","For generations,
it has been our task, our duty,"
315,"00:31:06,958","00:31:08,500",to protect our people.
316,"00:31:09,750","00:31:13,083","The price is dear, but so too the reward."
317,"00:31:14,291","00:31:15,458","So, tonight,"
318,"00:31:16,833","00:31:22,041","you join a long line of women
who have helped to build this kingdom."
319,"00:31:26,000","00:31:28,958","When our ancestors
first lay claim to this island,"
320,"00:31:29,750","00:31:32,208","they found they were not
its sole inhabitants."
321,"00:31:33,166","00:31:35,458",A creature dwelt here first.
322,"00:31:36,416","00:31:38,083",The last of its kind.
323,"00:31:39,208","00:31:41,208","With savage bloodlust,"
324,"00:31:41,291","00:31:44,750","the beast left its lair
and set upon the village."
325,"00:31:46,041","00:31:50,166","So the king gathered his soldiers
to avenge his people."
326,"00:31:50,916","00:31:53,375","But their steel
was no match for the monster,"
327,"00:31:54,333","00:31:56,791",and each man met his end.
328,"00:31:57,875","00:32:00,041",Each save one.
329,"00:32:00,958","00:32:05,500","For the king,
the beast had a far worse fate in store."
330,"00:32:06,333","00:32:10,166","Give up his three beloved daughters
and the island could be shared."
331,"00:32:11,208","00:32:12,625",A cruel torture.
332,"00:32:13,583","00:32:14,791","He adored his daughters,"
333,"00:32:16,375","00:32:19,041",but his duty to his subjects was stronger.
334,"00:32:20,083","00:32:22,500","And so, a pact was made."
335,"00:32:22,583","00:32:25,958","The three princesses met their end
in the belly of the beast,"
336,"00:32:26,041","00:32:27,625",and a kingdom was born.
337,"00:32:35,333","00:32:38,916","It is this sacrifice
we commemorate every generation."
338,"00:32:39,000","00:32:41,416",A tradition going back centuries.
339,"00:32:52,666","00:32:54,083","Your hand, child."
340,"00:33:02,125","00:33:07,708","A legacy of honor and duty
you now inherit, Princess Elodie of Aurea."
341,"00:33:20,375","00:33:24,458","Let our two lines mingle
and fast become one."
342,"00:33:25,916","00:33:28,375",She is now of royal blood.
343,"00:33:40,458","00:33:43,583","To ensure that our kingdom
thrives forevermore,"
344,"00:33:44,250","00:33:45,791",pay your due to the realm.
345,"00:33:48,291","00:33:50,208",Toss the coin into the chasm.
346,"00:34:02,875","00:34:05,041",The ceremony is now complete.
347,"00:34:07,250","00:34:08,916",You may make your return.
348,"00:34:12,708","00:34:14,583",I'm supposed to carry you back.
349,"00:34:14,666","00:34:16,666","I'm fine with walking, really."
350,"00:34:22,000","00:34:23,875",Floria would love this part.
351,"00:34:25,875","00:34:26,916",Close your eyes.
352,"00:34:28,083","00:34:29,125",I've got you.
353,"00:34:53,625","00:34:54,625",I'm sorry.
354,"00:35:01,458","00:35:02,791",No!
355,"00:36:03,041","00:36:04,625",Help me!
356,"00:36:20,666","00:36:22,291",Help!
357,"00:36:23,958","00:36:25,500",Is anyone there?!
358,"00:37:30,666","00:37:32,000",That's not mine.
359,"00:37:34,000","00:37:35,666",I am the sacrifice.
360,"00:37:37,000","00:37:38,583",I am the sacrifice?
361,"00:39:13,416","00:39:14,708",You poor thing.
362,"00:39:15,583","00:39:17,041",What happened to you?
363,"00:40:25,708","00:40:27,500","Give me strength, Mother."
364,"00:40:28,375","00:40:29,708",Mother?
365,"00:41:25,750","00:41:29,125","Your name, little bird?"
366,"00:41:31,291","00:41:33,333",Speak your name.
367,"00:41:35,125","00:41:36,208",Elodie.
368,"00:41:36,833","00:41:40,333",El-o-die.
369,"00:41:41,791","00:41:43,375",Exciting.
370,"00:41:45,250","00:41:46,416",What do you want?
371,"00:41:49,916","00:41:54,333",I want... what is promised.
372,"00:41:57,000","00:41:58,875",What is owed.
373,"00:42:01,166","00:42:07,041","Every generation, your kind must pay."
374,"00:42:10,500","00:42:11,750",My kind?
375,"00:42:11,833","00:42:15,166",The scent of royalty betrays you.
376,"00:42:16,208","00:42:18,250",It's in your blood.
377,"00:42:33,125","00:42:38,625","Now, my favorite part."
378,"00:42:41,625","00:42:44,375",Run.
379,"00:44:10,833","00:44:12,875",Did I hurt you?
380,"00:44:17,958","00:44:19,458",Quiet now?
381,"00:44:20,750","00:44:23,458",A clever one.
382,"00:44:24,625","00:44:27,541",The last one was over so quick.
383,"00:45:02,875","00:45:04,041",No.
384,"00:45:29,083","00:45:30,958",Mother wanted you to fight.
385,"00:47:47,083","00:47:49,875",No. No.
386,"00:49:01,500","00:49:03,041",He is a prince.
387,"00:49:04,791","00:49:06,958","They must
get to know each other."
388,"00:49:10,375","00:49:12,791","My greatest wish
is to go see the world."
389,"00:49:14,208","00:49:15,791","Perhaps, one day we will."
390,"00:50:18,041","00:50:19,041",One for the dress.
391,"00:51:03,458","00:51:04,500",Don't worry.
392,"00:51:05,958","00:51:07,291",I won't hurt you.
393,"00:53:29,541","00:53:32,458","Almost caught you, little bird."
394,"00:53:36,833","00:53:41,666","You hide now, like all the others."
395,"00:53:50,458","00:53:52,833",It makes no difference.
396,"00:53:54,750","00:53:59,291",This story always ends the same.

404,"00:54:53,250","00:54:54,416",How many?
405,"00:54:59,583","00:55:01,125",Did anyone make it out?
406,"00:56:01,625","00:56:03,625","Please, don't."
407,"00:56:04,458","00:56:05,583",Somebody...
408,"00:56:47,166","00:56:48,166",It's a lie.
409,"00:57:02,916","00:57:04,125",Get off.
410,"00:57:50,666","00:57:52,125",I'm deeply sorry...
411,"00:57:54,041","00:57:55,833",for underestimating you.
412,"00:58:00,458","00:58:01,625",A map.
413,"00:58:04,083","00:58:06,541","Now, where am I?"
414,"00:58:09,125","00:58:10,125",A tree.
415,"00:58:11,875","00:58:13,083",The entrance cave.
416,"00:58:16,250","00:58:20,666",Following down into the bird cave.
417,"00:58:24,416","00:58:25,791",Through the twisted tunnel...

419,"00:58:31,125","00:58:33,208",The glowworm cave.

421,"00:58:38,041","00:58:39,416",I am here.
422,"00:58:42,125","00:58:43,416",How do I escape?
423,"00:58:47,791","00:58:48,791",Is this it?
424,"00:58:50,083","00:58:51,958",Did a princess make it out?
425,"00:58:56,833","00:58:59,666",Three ways. Take the middle fork.

429,"00:59:08,625","00:59:12,041",And then... I am free.
430,"00:59:27,250","00:59:28,541",The middle fork.
431,"01:00:05,375","01:00:06,375",Music.

433,"01:00:51,375","01:00:52,458",This is it.
434,"01:01:06,166","01:01:07,291",Wish me luck.
435,"01:01:19,750","01:01:21,041",You made it out.
436,"01:02:47,375","01:02:48,583",No!
437,"01:03:01,708","01:03:04,541",Elodie.
438,"01:03:06,583","01:03:09,166","Fly, little bird."
439,"01:05:08,958","01:05:09,958",Hello.
440,"01:05:12,000","01:05:13,125",Hello!
441,"01:05:15,416","01:05:18,541",I'm here! Help!

443,"01:05:22,500","01:05:24,500",Hello!
444,"01:05:32,166","01:05:35,916","There is no way out, Princess."
445,"01:05:37,208","01:05:39,583",Not for any of you.
446,"01:05:42,166","01:05:43,875",Three were taken.
447,"01:05:44,625","01:05:47,375",Three must be given.
448,"01:05:53,333","01:05:54,708",Elodie!
449,"01:05:56,916","01:05:58,166",What's this?
450,"01:06:09,166","01:06:10,875",Elodie!
451,"01:06:22,791","01:06:24,166",Elodie!
452,"01:06:31,083","01:06:32,083",Move on.
453,"01:06:35,041","01:06:37,916","I've done what you paid for, milord.
I'll just wait up top."
454,"01:06:38,000","01:06:39,666",You'll do no such thing.
455,"01:06:41,041","01:06:42,916",I hired you to guide us to her.
456,"01:06:44,041","01:06:47,333",No one leaves here without my daughter.
457,"01:06:59,875","01:07:01,666",Elodie!
458,"01:07:03,416","01:07:04,875",Elodie!
459,"01:07:41,250","01:07:43,708",A creature dwelt here first.
460,"01:07:45,875","01:07:47,500",The last of its kind.
461,"01:07:49,708","01:07:50,958",It's a lie.
462,"01:07:55,666","01:07:56,791",Three taken.
463,"01:08:15,750","01:08:17,083",Slay the vile young.
464,"01:08:35,333","01:08:36,625",Form the line!
465,"01:08:52,791","01:08:55,041","Please, spare me."
466,"01:08:56,458","01:08:57,875",Show mercy.
467,"01:09:00,416","01:09:02,083",I will give you anything.
468,"01:09:06,708","01:09:10,291",Death is not enough for you.
469,"01:09:10,375","01:09:13,125",You will know my pain.
470,"01:09:18,041","01:09:19,625",Elodie!
471,"01:09:23,666","01:09:25,000",Elodie!
472,"01:09:38,375","01:09:40,208",Elodie!
473,"01:09:44,333","01:09:45,916",Elodie!
474,"01:09:46,000","01:09:48,916",Be quiet. She can hear you.
475,"01:09:50,625","01:09:54,000","I warned you. It's too late.
The beast lurks in its lair."
476,"01:09:54,750","01:09:58,333","- It's surely taken her there to devour...
- This lair. Where is it?"
477,"01:09:58,416","01:10:01,041","Sir, your daughter's been
down here nigh on too long."
478,"01:10:01,666","01:10:03,208",She's almost certainly been killed.
479,"01:10:04,541","01:10:05,916",Elodie!
480,"01:10:08,541","01:10:11,041","I'm told some have tried
to hunt the beast."
481,"01:10:12,500","01:10:13,500",For its blood.
482,"01:10:14,666","01:10:15,791",Nonsense.
483,"01:11:18,208","01:11:20,958",Why are you here?
484,"01:11:21,708","01:11:23,750",I'm here for my daughter.
485,"01:11:25,208","01:11:26,125",Father.
486,"01:12:06,458","01:12:08,750",Father.
487,"01:12:09,750","01:12:10,750",Please.
488,"01:12:12,000","01:12:13,250",I beg of you.
489,"01:12:23,208","01:12:27,500",It's not my mercy that you should seek.
490,"01:12:28,708","01:12:30,250",Call her.
491,"01:12:31,208","01:12:32,291",She's alive?
492,"01:12:33,208","01:12:34,750",Elodie's still alive?
493,"01:12:35,541","01:12:36,958",I smell her.
494,"01:12:38,791","01:12:40,041",Hiding.
495,"01:12:41,500","01:12:42,916",Watching.
496,"01:12:52,208","01:12:54,083",Call her.
497,"01:12:55,083","01:12:56,083",No.
498,"01:12:57,708","01:12:59,208",Call her.
499,"01:13:04,458","01:13:05,458",Elodie.
500,"01:13:07,916","01:13:08,916",Can you hear me?
501,"01:13:14,166","01:13:19,041","I have... I have made a horrible,
horrible mistake."
502,"01:13:20,875","01:13:23,916",To sacrifice the one thing I love most.
503,"01:13:24,791","01:13:27,125",To trade your life
504,"01:13:28,666","01:13:30,458",for the good of my people.
505,"01:13:32,125","01:13:34,416",I thought that I could take the gold.
506,"01:13:37,083","01:13:38,750",That I could live with myself.
507,"01:13:40,458","01:13:41,458",My choice.
508,"01:13:45,333","01:13:46,416",But I can't.
509,"01:13:48,625","01:13:49,625",I can't.
510,"01:13:57,791","01:14:00,041",Tell her to come to you.
511,"01:14:05,583","01:14:07,750",Last chance.
512,"01:14:11,916","01:14:15,250",Elodie. Hear me.
513,"01:14:16,958","01:14:20,208",I am your father. You will obey me.
514,"01:14:21,875","01:14:23,166",I order you.
515,"01:14:24,250","01:14:26,083",Do not come out!
516,"01:14:29,708","01:14:30,541",No.
517,"01:14:36,791","01:14:37,791",No!
518,"01:15:32,625","01:15:33,791",Ellie.
519,"01:15:39,791","01:15:40,958",Use the ropes.
520,"01:15:41,041","01:15:42,708","Your stepmother and Floria,"
521,"01:15:43,500","01:15:46,625",they wait for you at the ship.
522,"01:15:49,916","01:15:51,333",Forgive me.
523,"01:17:44,541","01:17:46,000",Go! Go! Go!
524,"01:18:04,750","01:18:05,958",Go.
525,"01:18:42,541","01:18:46,041",That damn girl. I knew she was trouble.
526,"01:18:47,875","01:18:49,625","- Where are you going?
- To fix this."
527,"01:19:23,666","01:19:25,958","- Stop.
- Stand back."
528,"01:19:34,458","01:19:35,458",Elodie.
529,"01:19:38,541","01:19:39,541",Open up!
530,"01:19:39,583","01:19:41,333",Get out of the way!
531,"01:19:43,958","01:19:45,000",Get out!
532,"01:19:51,041","01:19:51,958",Seize her.
533,"01:19:52,041","01:19:53,291",You can't!
534,"01:19:53,375","01:19:55,166","- No! She's just a child!
- No!"
535,"01:19:55,250","01:19:56,791",You promised us a daughter.
536,"01:19:56,875","01:19:59,083","- Stepmother!
- No!"
537,"01:19:59,166","01:20:00,583",Floria!
538,"01:20:56,208","01:20:57,208",Elodie.
539,"01:21:02,083","01:21:03,083",Stepmother.
540,"01:21:06,666","01:21:08,291","- Elodie.
- Stepmother."
541,"01:21:08,375","01:21:09,750",Oh!
542,"01:21:09,833","01:21:11,000",Thank God.
543,"01:21:11,083","01:21:12,541",Are you all right?
544,"01:21:12,625","01:21:13,625",I can manage.
545,"01:21:15,083","01:21:15,958",Where's Floria?
546,"01:21:16,041","01:21:18,875",They took her to the caves in your place.
547,"01:21:18,958","01:21:21,000","I tried to stop them
from taking your sister."
548,"01:21:21,083","01:21:22,291",I have to save her.
549,"01:21:22,375","01:21:24,875","No, I'll go. I can find her."
550,"01:21:24,958","01:21:26,083",It may be too late.
551,"01:21:27,041","01:21:28,041",No.
552,"01:21:28,458","01:21:30,166",Not if I can help it.
553,"01:21:31,666","01:21:32,666",Your father...
554,"01:21:36,541","01:21:37,791",Go.
555,"01:21:44,166","01:21:47,333",Please. Let me go!
556,"01:21:47,416","01:21:49,541",Please let me go.
557,"01:21:51,416","01:21:52,250","No, don't do this."
558,"01:21:52,333","01:21:54,625","Mother, enough! She's too young."
559,"01:21:54,708","01:21:58,833","A prince protects his kingdom,
without hesitation or complaint."
560,"01:21:58,916","01:21:59,958",Give me your hand.
561,"01:22:00,041","01:22:03,083",I cannot do this. She's just a child.
562,"01:22:03,666","01:22:05,791",You're weak.
563,"01:22:05,875","01:22:09,416",No! Please don't do this to me!
564,"01:22:14,833","01:22:16,625",Get off of me!
565,"01:22:17,208","01:22:18,916",Let go! Off of me!
566,"01:22:19,000","01:22:20,166",Throw her in.
567,"01:22:44,958","01:22:46,166",Floria!
568,"01:22:46,833","01:22:48,541",Floria!
569,"01:22:50,166","01:22:51,916",Floria!
570,"01:23:43,250","01:23:44,791","I'm coming for you, Flor."
571,"01:24:46,000","01:24:47,708",My little ones...
572,"01:24:50,375","01:24:52,333",They did not let you live.
573,"01:24:54,666","01:24:57,958",Nor shall I let Elodie.
574,"01:25:09,083","01:25:12,583",Your sister will come for you.
575,"01:25:28,875","01:25:30,791",There she is now.
576,"01:25:54,666","01:25:56,791","Hello, Floria. Floria, can you hear me?"
577,"01:25:57,666","01:25:58,583",Wake up!
578,"01:25:58,666","01:26:00,375",We need to hurry.
579,"01:26:00,458","01:26:01,500",Floria!
580,"01:26:02,166","01:26:03,166",Ellie.
581,"01:26:06,041","01:26:07,500","Elodie, you're alive."
582,"01:26:08,583","01:26:10,958",Okay. I'm going to get you out of here.
583,"01:26:15,708","01:26:18,208",My leg. I hurt it when I fell.
584,"01:26:19,666","01:26:21,125","We don't have time, Flor."
585,"01:26:31,750","01:26:33,708","No, no, no. Not yet."
586,"01:26:33,791","01:26:34,833",What now?
587,"01:26:34,916","01:26:36,333",You have to hide quickly.
588,"01:26:36,416","01:26:37,583",What about you?
589,"01:26:37,666","01:26:39,125",I must tell her the truth.
590,"01:26:39,208","01:26:40,208",Come on.
591,"01:26:56,416","01:26:59,125",Where are you hiding?
592,"01:27:03,333","01:27:04,541",Dragon.
593,"01:27:09,375","01:27:11,166","That won't kill me,"
594,"01:27:12,250","01:27:14,625",but it will make me angry.
595,"01:27:14,708","01:27:15,958",Good.
596,"01:27:16,583","01:27:18,625",I'm angry too.
597,"01:27:23,333","01:27:25,041",We have both been lied to.
598,"01:27:25,708","01:27:27,625",They said you set upon their village.
599,"01:27:27,708","01:27:30,041","That the king came
only to defend his people."
600,"01:27:30,750","01:27:33,708",He came unprovoked.
601,"01:27:35,000","01:27:36,291",I know what they did.
602,"01:27:37,041","01:27:38,500",I know they killed your children.
603,"01:27:39,083","01:27:41,583","""They""? You!"
604,"01:27:41,666","01:27:44,125","Your kind, your blood."
605,"01:27:44,208","01:27:45,041",No!
606,"01:27:45,125","01:27:48,875",My daughters were the last of my line.
607,"01:27:48,958","01:27:53,083","So, I will take their daughters
until my final breath."
608,"01:27:53,791","01:27:57,000","Except you haven't.
We are not their daughters."
609,"01:27:57,083","01:27:58,750",More lies.
610,"01:28:36,500","01:28:37,625",Ellie!
611,"01:28:52,041","01:28:56,791","Now, you will know my daughters' pain."
612,"01:29:44,250","01:29:46,500",I am not one of them!
613,"01:29:51,625","01:29:53,916",I smell it in your blood.
614,"01:31:19,833","01:31:23,416",El-o-die.
615,"01:31:25,666","01:31:28,041",Accept your fate...
616,"01:31:34,000","01:31:36,000",as I have mine.
617,"01:31:40,083","01:31:43,708",We are to die alone.
618,"01:31:51,041","01:31:52,333",No.
619,"01:31:55,916","01:31:57,875",I have an army with me.
620,"01:32:00,541","01:32:04,416","Every innocent woman
whose life was stolen down here."
621,"01:32:06,708","01:32:10,958",Your kind were never innocent.
622,"01:32:18,125","01:32:19,375",Then go ahead.
623,"01:32:23,583","01:32:25,208",Show me your fire.
624,"01:32:30,125","01:32:31,125",Well?
625,"01:32:32,291","01:32:33,750",What are you waiting for?
626,"01:32:36,875","01:32:37,958",Burn me.
627,"01:32:40,583","01:32:41,625",Burn me!
628,"01:33:45,583","01:33:47,208",My sister had this too.
629,"01:33:48,625","01:33:49,750",All of us did.
630,"01:33:50,750","01:33:52,875",That is how they make us royal.
631,"01:33:54,250","01:33:56,458",That is the blood you smell.
632,"01:34:06,958","01:34:08,125",They fooled you.
633,"01:34:10,125","01:34:13,458","You've been killing
innocent daughters just like they did."
634,"01:34:21,541","01:34:24,541","Then, end it."
635,"01:34:51,041","01:34:52,041",No.
636,"01:34:56,750","01:34:59,000",I'm through doing what I'm told.
637,"01:36:19,041","01:36:20,041",Elodie.
638,"01:36:26,708","01:36:29,541","You must believe me.
I haven't slept a moment since..."
639,"01:36:29,625","01:36:31,458",Since you tried to kill my sister?
640,"01:36:32,958","01:36:33,958",I had no choice.
641,"01:36:34,041","01:36:37,000",Don't you dare explain yourself to this...
642,"01:36:37,083","01:36:38,666",this commoner.
643,"01:36:42,916","01:36:44,583",Is she to be the third?
644,"01:36:45,541","01:36:47,041",Princess number three.
645,"01:36:48,791","01:36:52,250","She's the last,
and then I'll be free to marry whoever I..."
646,"01:36:52,333","01:36:54,000","That's enough, Henry."
647,"01:36:54,958","01:36:57,375",You know nothing of what we've endured.
648,"01:36:58,041","01:37:00,291",You know nothing of our story.
649,"01:37:08,625","01:37:10,000",Take your family
650,"01:37:11,833","01:37:13,166",and run.
651,"01:37:15,208","01:37:16,541",Come. Let's go.
652,"01:37:18,375","01:37:21,833","I will offer you all
one last chance to do the same."
653,"01:37:29,333","01:37:30,333",No?
654,"01:37:32,250","01:37:34,750",You insolent creature.
655,"01:37:35,791","01:37:37,541",You think we ought to fear you now?
656,"01:37:38,958","01:37:39,958",Why?
657,"01:37:40,541","01:37:43,750","Because you somehow
managed to escape the dragon?"
658,"01:37:47,541","01:37:49,708",It's not me you should fear.
659,"01:37:50,958","01:37:54,291",This is the end of your story.
660,"01:37:55,375","01:37:56,375",Run!
661,"01:38:10,750","01:38:13,416","- It's the dragon!
- Run!"
662,"01:38:36,125","01:38:42,833",No!
663,"01:39:28,958","01:39:31,125","Someone give me a hand
with this barrel."
664,"01:39:31,208","01:39:32,875","Let's be sharp there, lads."
665,"01:39:32,958","01:39:35,125",You can't be serious.
666,"01:39:35,208","01:39:36,083",But I am.
667,"01:39:36,166","01:39:37,916",We'll run it together.
668,"01:39:38,000","01:39:39,583",We've got a bounty of supplies.
669,"01:39:39,666","01:39:42,041","Enough to get us through
this freeze and the next."
670,"01:39:42,125","01:39:43,166","Oh, Elodie."
671,"01:39:43,250","01:39:46,458","You're the only person I trust
to look after our people, Mother."
672,"01:39:55,333","01:39:56,500",Can I help too?
673,"01:39:59,791","01:40:00,791",Floria.
674,"01:40:01,166","01:40:02,791",I'm counting on it.
675,"01:40:12,000","01:40:14,541","Stepmother.
Stepmother, come and see this."
676,"01:40:14,625","01:40:16,208","Oh, wide heavens!"
677,"01:40:16,291","01:40:19,458","My lady,
what course shall we steer?"
678,"01:40:21,750","01:40:22,750",Home.
