1,"00:01:15,040","00:01:16,280",Benji?
2,"00:01:16,600","00:01:18,364","Benji, do you copy?"
3,"00:01:19,200","00:01:20,531",Benji?
4,"00:01:21,880","00:01:23,882","- Shit.
- Where is Ethan?"
5,"00:01:24,640","00:01:25,801",I can't talk right now.
6,"00:01:26,280","00:01:28,700",The package is on the plane.
7,"00:01:28,800","00:01:30,370","Yeah, I know."
8,"00:01:30,600","00:01:34,286","We're currently formulating a plan B.
Although, technically, it's a plan C."
9,"00:01:34,440","00:01:36,020",This isn't going very well.
10,"00:01:36,120","00:01:37,980","I am aware of that, Brandt.
You're not helping."
11,"00:01:38,080","00:01:40,651","- Where's Ethan?
- I don't know. We're on radio silence."
12,"00:01:40,760","00:01:43,300","That plane cannot take off
with the package on it."
13,"00:01:43,400","00:01:45,004","- Do you understand?
- We're working on it."
14,"00:01:45,520","00:01:47,700","Luther? What the hell
are you doing there?"
15,"00:01:47,800","00:01:49,460","You're supposed to be
on assignment in Malaysia!"
16,"00:01:49,560","00:01:51,220","I am in Malaysia.
I've been here two days."
17,"00:01:51,320","00:01:53,220","- Benji needed my help.
- I didn't need help."
18,"00:01:53,320","00:01:55,780","I needed assistance.
It's a different thing."
19,"00:01:55,880","00:01:57,041",The package is still on the plane.
20,"00:01:59,720","00:02:01,420","We understand the package
is on the plane."
21,"00:02:01,520","00:02:03,807","- We're trying to cripple it remotely.
- You can do that?"
22,"00:02:04,040","00:02:06,620","We can if the pilot left
the satellite uplink switched on."
23,"00:02:06,720","00:02:07,820",Which he has.
24,"00:02:07,920","00:02:11,380","- And how do you access the uplink?
- It involves hacking a Russian satellite."
25,"00:02:11,480","00:02:14,324","- I can't authorize that.
- Which is why I didn't ask permission."
26,"00:02:14,640","00:02:17,060","We're under investigation
for misconduct."
27,"00:02:17,160","00:02:19,401","The package is on board.
What do you want me to do?"
28,"00:02:28,600","00:02:30,045",Luther.
29,"00:02:30,360","00:02:32,020","I'm reading a heat bloom, Benji."
30,"00:02:32,120","00:02:34,282","- The engines are starting.
- Yeah, I'm aware of that."
31,"00:02:34,640","00:02:37,246","But I can't do anything
until I'm connected to the satellite."
32,"00:02:38,200","00:02:39,300","Benji, you're connected."
33,"00:02:39,400","00:02:40,606","Okay, great."
34,"00:02:42,040","00:02:43,485",The package is still on that plane.
35,"00:02:44,600","00:02:45,601",Shut down the fuel pump.
36,"00:02:47,280","00:02:48,486",The mechanicals are locked down.
37,"00:02:48,600","00:02:51,001","- What about the electrical system?
- That might work."
38,"00:02:51,320","00:02:52,321",No.
39,"00:02:52,440","00:02:54,283","- Hydraulics!
- Okay, stand by."
40,"00:02:54,440","00:02:55,930","No, they're encrypted."
41,"00:02:58,000","00:02:58,980","Benji, the plane!"
42,"00:02:59,080","00:03:01,367","Yes! The package is on the plane!
We get it!"
43,"00:03:04,120","00:03:05,281",Can you open the door?
44,"00:03:06,280","00:03:07,611",Ethan? Where are you?
45,"00:03:07,760","00:03:10,331","I'm by the plane.
Benji, can you open the door?"
46,"00:03:10,440","00:03:12,807",Can I open the door? Maybe.
47,"00:03:13,280","00:03:15,009",Open the door when I tell you!
48,"00:03:29,760","00:03:31,364",I'm on the plane. Open the door.
49,"00:03:31,480","00:03:32,540",How did you get in the plane?
50,"00:03:32,640","00:03:35,291",Not in the plane. I'm on the plane!
51,"00:03:35,600","00:03:37,329",Open the door!
52,"00:03:42,080","00:03:43,889",Benji! Open the door!
53,"00:03:44,440","00:03:45,805","Yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay, okay!"
54,"00:03:51,320","00:03:53,322","- Benji, open that door right now!
- Yeah, I'm trying!"
55,"00:04:08,720","00:04:10,290","- Come on, Benji!
- Benji, open that door!"
56,"00:04:11,640","00:04:12,687",Come on! Come on!
57,"00:04:18,840","00:04:20,020",Come on!
58,"00:04:20,120","00:04:21,201","Yes, got it!"
59,"00:04:26,960","00:04:28,380",That's the wrong door!
60,"00:04:28,480","00:04:30,209","Benji, not that door. The other door."
61,"00:04:30,840","00:04:32,460","The other door, right!
Yes, the other door."
62,"00:04:32,560","00:04:34,688","Okay, yes! Sorry, my bad, my bad!"
63,"00:04:40,880","00:04:41,961",Check it out.
64,"00:04:42,840","00:04:45,366","All right, look, I'm gonna open
the para door! How's that?"
65,"00:06:32,160","00:06:33,810",We're about to close.
66,"00:06:34,080","00:06:35,411",I won't be long.
67,"00:06:35,960","00:06:38,167","Are you looking for anything
in particular?"
68,"00:06:39,400","00:06:41,368",Something rare.
69,"00:06:45,080","00:06:46,570",Let me guess.
70,"00:06:48,480","00:06:49,561",Classical.
71,"00:06:50,160","00:06:51,685","- Jazz.
- Sax?"
72,"00:06:52,160","00:06:54,060","- Coltrane.
- Piano?"
73,"00:06:54,160","00:06:55,161",Monk.
74,"00:06:55,680","00:06:58,060",Shadow Wilson on bass.
75,"00:06:58,160","00:07:00,322",Shadow Wilson played drums.
76,"00:07:01,440","00:07:03,568",Know why they call him Shadow?
77,"00:07:04,040","00:07:06,441",Because he had a light touch.
78,"00:07:07,400","00:07:08,811",You're in luck.
79,"00:07:10,560","00:07:12,528",I have a first pressing.
80,"00:07:21,080","00:07:22,730",It really is you.
81,"00:07:25,920","00:07:27,206",I've heard stories.
82,"00:07:28,240","00:07:29,924",They can't all be true.
83,"00:07:52,240","00:07:53,900","Good evening, Mr. Hunt."
84,"00:07:54,000","00:07:57,780","The weapons you recovered in Belarus
were confirmed to be VX nerve gas"
85,"00:07:57,880","00:07:59,723",capable of devastating a major city.
86,"00:08:00,680","00:08:02,140",The bodies of the air crew were found
87,"00:08:02,240","00:08:05,084","less than 24 hours
after they landed in Damascus."
88,"00:08:05,240","00:08:08,300","They were identified as
low-level Chechen separatists"
89,"00:08:08,400","00:08:10,220",with neither the access nor the ability
90,"00:08:10,320","00:08:12,448","to acquire the weapons
they were transporting."
91,"00:08:13,480","00:08:14,980",This would support your suspicion
92,"00:08:15,080","00:08:18,340","that a shadow organization
is committed to inciting revolution"
93,"00:08:18,440","00:08:22,081","by enabling acts of terror
in nations friendly to Western interests."
94,"00:08:22,600","00:08:25,580","IMF suspects this to be
the same shadow organization"
95,"00:08:25,680","00:08:27,820","you have been tracking
for the last year,"
96,"00:08:27,920","00:08:29,809",also known as the Syndicate.
97,"00:08:30,280","00:08:32,362",IMF would be right.
98,"00:08:32,760","00:08:34,780","Normally, you and your team
would be tasked"
99,"00:08:34,880","00:08:37,860","with infiltrating and disrupting
this terrorist network."
100,"00:08:37,960","00:08:41,580","But we have taken steps to ensure
that this will not happen."
101,"00:08:41,680","00:08:44,260","Because we are
the Syndicate, Mr. Hunt."
102,"00:08:44,360","00:08:46,601",And now we know who you are.
103,"00:08:47,120","00:08:50,841","Your mission, should you choose
to accept it, is to face your fate."
104,"00:08:51,120","00:08:55,180","Pursue us, you will be caught.
Resist us, you will be killed."
105,"00:08:55,280","00:08:59,251","And your precious Secretary will
disavow any knowledge of your actions."
106,"00:08:59,360","00:09:00,620","Good luck, Mr. Hunt."
107,"00:09:00,720","00:09:03,371","This message will self-destruct
in five seconds."
108,"00:09:54,680","00:09:57,420","Mr. Chairman,
the IMF's misadventures date back"
109,"00:09:57,520","00:09:59,340",to my earliest days at the CIA
110,"00:09:59,440","00:10:03,923","when the IMF broke into the CIA
to steal a list of covert operatives."
111,"00:10:04,200","00:10:06,100","And now, more recently,
a Russian warhead?"
112,"00:10:06,200","00:10:07,260",Disarmed Russian warhead.
113,"00:10:07,360","00:10:09,840","- A Russian nuclear warhead...
- Rendered safe by the IMF."
114,"00:10:09,960","00:10:11,660",...clipped the Transamerica Pyramid
115,"00:10:11,760","00:10:13,580","before plunging into
the San Francisco Bay."
116,"00:10:13,680","00:10:16,650","- Saving the western hemisphere.
- This made possible by IMF agents"
117,"00:10:16,760","00:10:20,660","who did willingly provide
the launch codes to a known terrorist."
118,"00:10:20,760","00:10:22,046","Do I have that right, Agent Brandt?"
119,"00:10:24,120","00:10:26,100",I can neither confirm nor deny details
120,"00:10:26,200","00:10:28,260","of any such operation
without the Secretary's approval."
121,"00:10:28,360","00:10:31,180","This was the same week that the IMF
infiltrated the Kremlin."
122,"00:10:31,280","00:10:32,645",Here is the Kremlin before
123,"00:10:34,720","00:10:36,324",and the Kremlin after.
124,"00:10:39,080","00:10:41,900","I can neither confirm nor deny details
of any operation..."
125,"00:10:42,000","00:10:43,740","Without the Secretary's approval,
yes, we know."
126,"00:10:43,840","00:10:46,140","In fact, until this panel appoints
a new Secretary,"
127,"00:10:46,240","00:10:48,660","you really can't say much of anything,
can you, Agent Brandt?"
128,"00:10:48,760","00:10:50,220","Well, I didn't write
the rules, Mr. Hunley."
129,"00:10:50,320","00:10:53,060","Mr. Chairman,
the so-called Impossible Mission Force"
130,"00:10:53,160","00:10:55,260",is not just a rogue organization.
131,"00:10:55,360","00:10:59,260","It is an outdated one, a throwback
to an era without transparency"
132,"00:10:59,360","00:11:00,860","- and without oversight.
- Mr. Chairman?"
133,"00:11:00,960","00:11:03,531","- Time has come to dissolve the IMF...
- Mr. Chairman?"
134,"00:11:03,640","00:11:06,980","...and transfer their salvageable assets
to the CIA."
135,"00:11:07,080","00:11:10,060","Mr. Chairman, the IMF has operated
without oversight for 40 years."
136,"00:11:10,160","00:11:12,820","- Mr. Chairman?
- Are its methods unorthodox? Yes."
137,"00:11:12,920","00:11:15,820","Are its results less than perfect?
Absolutely."
138,"00:11:15,920","00:11:18,540","- But without the IMF...
- There will be order and stability!"
139,"00:11:18,640","00:11:20,005",Without the IMF...
140,"00:11:21,920","00:11:26,860","This panel recognizes the IMF's
contribution to global security."
141,"00:11:26,960","00:11:30,328","But the events laid out
by CIA Director Hunley"
142,"00:11:30,440","00:11:33,340","also show a pattern
of wanton brinksmanship"
143,"00:11:33,440","00:11:36,260",and a total disregard for protocol.
144,"00:11:36,360","00:11:39,100","From where I sit,
your unorthodox methods"
145,"00:11:39,200","00:11:41,540",are indistinguishable from chance.
146,"00:11:41,640","00:11:46,726","And your results, perfect or not,
look suspiciously like luck."
147,"00:11:48,160","00:11:52,165","I'm afraid today is the day
when the IMF's luck runs out."
148,"00:13:32,440","00:13:34,090",What are you doing here?
149,"00:13:38,920","00:13:41,207","I said, what are you doing here?"
150,"00:13:49,240","00:13:51,129","What does he see in you, I wonder?"
151,"00:13:52,400","00:13:53,606","Who is ""he""?"
152,"00:13:58,080","00:14:00,003",I want to see what he's made of.
153,"00:14:01,760","00:14:05,287","Well, why don't you take off the cuffs
and I'll show you,"
154,"00:14:06,280","00:14:07,441",Vinter?
155,"00:14:11,560","00:14:13,210",You know who I am.
156,"00:14:13,440","00:14:15,124",Janik Vinter.
157,"00:14:16,160","00:14:18,970",They call you the Bone Doctor.
158,"00:14:20,600","00:14:21,806","The funny thing is,"
159,"00:14:22,840","00:14:26,208","you were officially declared dead
three years ago."
160,"00:14:26,880","00:14:27,927","Nice shoes, by the way."
161,"00:14:30,640","00:14:31,641",Not his.
162,"00:14:32,720","00:14:33,960",Yours.
163,"00:14:40,800","00:14:42,723","Our instructions
were to break him down..."
164,"00:14:43,360","00:14:44,860",...not kill him.
165,"00:14:44,960","00:14:47,281",Some guys break different than others.
166,"00:14:49,600","00:14:51,170",This one's a fighter.
167,"00:14:51,600","00:14:53,728",He'll die before you turn him.
168,"00:14:54,120","00:14:55,645","Are you worried
he's going to take your place?"
169,"00:15:07,440","00:15:11,047",You should go before it gets ugly.
170,"00:15:14,160","00:15:17,403","Yeah, he's right. You should go."
171,"00:15:32,520","00:15:34,409",So now let's see how tough you are.
172,"00:17:01,160","00:17:03,367","We've never met before, right?"
173,"00:17:05,760","00:17:06,761",Follow me.
174,"00:17:15,200","00:17:16,281",Give me the gun!
175,"00:17:20,680","00:17:23,001","- What are you doing?
- I can't leave."
176,"00:17:23,280","00:17:25,169","You can't stay.
We just killed those men."
177,"00:17:25,360","00:17:27,780","We didn't kill them, you did."
178,"00:17:27,880","00:17:30,281",I tried to stop you. You got away.
179,"00:17:32,520","00:17:33,806",Who are you?
180,"00:17:34,480","00:17:36,801",You better hurry now. Good luck.
181,"00:17:37,520","00:17:38,726","No, wait! Wait!"
182,"00:17:39,160","00:17:40,241",Where is he?
183,"00:17:40,520","00:17:42,807","He's heading towards the north passage.
He's closed the gate."
184,"00:17:43,080","00:17:45,651",Run. He's getting away. Hurry.
185,"00:17:58,000","00:18:00,401","- Satcom seven.
- Western Europe unsecured."
186,"00:18:00,640","00:18:02,780","- Designator?
- Bravo-Echo-1-1."
187,"00:18:02,880","00:18:03,881",Connecting.
188,"00:18:04,840","00:18:06,842","- This is Brandt.
- Go secure."
189,"00:18:08,760","00:18:09,740",Go.
190,"00:18:09,840","00:18:12,844","London terminal is compromised.
Repeat, London is compromised."
191,"00:18:13,000","00:18:15,924","Agent in place is down.
Request immediate extraction."
192,"00:18:16,080","00:18:17,650","What happened?
Who breached London?"
193,"00:18:18,000","00:18:19,460",Do you have anything to go on?
194,"00:18:19,560","00:18:20,686",A face.
195,"00:18:20,960","00:18:24,442","He wanted something. Not information.
He could've killed me."
196,"00:18:25,040","00:18:26,087",But he didn't.
197,"00:18:26,560","00:18:29,723","- Okay. What do you think it means?
- The Syndicate is real."
198,"00:18:30,400","00:18:32,846","They know who we are, how we operate."
199,"00:18:33,160","00:18:35,900","I think I know why
they've been so hard to find."
200,"00:18:36,000","00:18:39,561","Just focus operations on gathering
any available intel regarding"
201,"00:18:39,680","00:18:41,060",former covert operatives.
202,"00:18:41,160","00:18:43,220","It doesn't matter
what country or agency,"
203,"00:18:43,320","00:18:45,580","just as long as they're dead
or presumed dead."
204,"00:18:45,680","00:18:48,020",Start with Janik Vinter.
205,"00:18:48,120","00:18:50,140",He's also known as the Bone Doctor.
206,"00:18:50,240","00:18:51,401",I can't do that.
207,"00:18:51,680","00:18:53,762",What? What are you talking about?
208,"00:18:54,680","00:18:56,682",The Committee has shut us down.
209,"00:18:57,000","00:18:59,367","Operations have been handed over
to the CIA."
210,"00:19:00,040","00:19:03,965","There is no more IMF.
I've been ordered to bring everyone in."
211,"00:19:05,640","00:19:07,369","- Ethan...
- I understand."
212,"00:19:07,520","00:19:09,284","- Ethan...
- I understand, Brandt."
213,"00:19:09,600","00:19:11,090",We didn't have this conversation.
214,"00:19:11,840","00:19:14,446","I've disappeared in London.
You don't know where I am."
215,"00:19:14,880","00:19:16,484",If I'm dead or alive.
216,"00:19:16,640","00:19:18,130","This man you saw, can you find him?"
217,"00:19:20,240","00:19:22,242",I won't stop until I do.
218,"00:19:23,480","00:19:26,006","This may very well be
our last mission, Ethan."
219,"00:19:26,600","00:19:27,931",Make it count.
220,"00:19:28,400","00:19:29,401",Brandt?
221,"00:19:48,920","00:19:50,660","Since we're going
to be working together,"
222,"00:19:50,760","00:19:52,603","I want you to choose
your next words very carefully."
223,"00:19:53,040","00:19:54,166",Where is Hunt?
224,"00:19:54,360","00:19:56,180","- I don't know.
- Don't lie to me, Brandt."
225,"00:19:56,280","00:19:58,780","I have no way of contacting him.
He's deep cover."
226,"00:19:58,880","00:20:00,723","Last I heard,
he's tracking the Syndicate."
227,"00:20:01,040","00:20:05,260","Let's cut the bull. You know who we are,
you know what we're capable of."
228,"00:20:05,360","00:20:07,020",How come the CIA has never discovered
229,"00:20:07,120","00:20:09,805","any actionable intel
regarding this Syndicate?"
230,"00:20:10,200","00:20:12,820","- What are you implying?
- Not implying. Stating."
231,"00:20:12,920","00:20:15,100","Leveling an accusation, actually."
232,"00:20:15,200","00:20:18,409","Hunt is both arsonist and fireman
at the same time."
233,"00:20:18,720","00:20:21,300","I believe that the Syndicate
is a figment of his imagination,"
234,"00:20:21,400","00:20:24,244",created to justify the IMF's existence.
235,"00:20:24,720","00:20:27,041","I am going to find him, Brandt,
and when I do,"
236,"00:20:27,160","00:20:28,820",he will be called upon to answer for
237,"00:20:28,920","00:20:32,242","every wanton act of mayhem
he is responsible for."
238,"00:20:35,000","00:20:36,490",Welcome to the CIA.
239,"00:20:38,920","00:20:40,649",You'll never find him.
240,"00:20:40,760","00:20:45,322","Set your watch, Brandt. Ethan Hunt
is living his last day as a free man."
241,"00:20:59,640","00:21:02,849","All right, everybody, heads up!
This is it."
242,"00:21:04,280","00:21:06,760","- Alpha team prepped, standing by.
- Execute."
243,"00:21:06,920","00:21:09,924","Langley, Brimstone. Go.
I say again, we are go."
244,"00:22:06,360","00:22:08,761","Langley, there's nobody here."
245,"00:22:15,200","00:22:18,283","Langley, Brimstone. Face the north wall."
246,"00:23:25,800","00:23:26,961",Dunn.
247,"00:23:28,600","00:23:31,046",Is it that time already? Okay.
248,"00:23:32,800","00:23:35,280","I will ask you
a series of control questions."
249,"00:23:35,440","00:23:37,020","I know, and I'm gonna answer truthfully,"
250,"00:23:37,120","00:23:39,460","and then you're gonna ask me
to lie intentionally."
251,"00:23:39,560","00:23:41,961","- State your name.
- The King of Norway."
252,"00:23:42,920","00:23:44,001","See, that's a lie."
253,"00:23:44,560","00:23:47,643","I'm actually third in line to the throne.
My brother was..."
254,"00:23:47,960","00:23:49,380",Has Ethan Hunt contacted you?
255,"00:23:49,480","00:23:51,528","- Why would he contact me?
- Hunt has resurfaced."
256,"00:23:51,680","00:23:53,205",This time in Cuba.
257,"00:23:53,400","00:23:56,370",He left these behind.
258,"00:23:57,560","00:23:59,324",Tell me what you make of them.
259,"00:23:59,640","00:24:01,780","I don't know.
He's taken up scrapbooking?"
260,"00:24:01,880","00:24:03,245","Look at the photographs, Dunn."
261,"00:24:03,600","00:24:06,126","All of them are either missing or dead.
Every one."
262,"00:24:06,440","00:24:08,180",All of them were government agents.
263,"00:24:08,280","00:24:10,408","Russian, French, British, Israeli,
you name it."
264,"00:24:11,120","00:24:14,700","These are highly classified files and yet
Hunt had no trouble collecting them."
265,"00:24:14,800","00:24:17,121","And he always seems to be
a step ahead of us."
266,"00:24:17,320","00:24:18,620",I wonder how.
267,"00:24:18,720","00:24:21,200","- Are you suggesting I'm helping him?
- The thought had crossed my mind."
268,"00:24:22,040","00:24:23,620","Six months I have been here,"
269,"00:24:23,720","00:24:27,860","sifting through mountains of metadata
and exabytes of encoded excrement."
270,"00:24:27,960","00:24:32,124","I have decrypted, processed, parsed
more data than anyone in my section."
271,"00:24:32,240","00:24:34,083","And yet, every week you haul me in here"
272,"00:24:34,200","00:24:37,044","and you ask me the same question,
just in a different way."
273,"00:24:37,160","00:24:39,970",And today you haven't answered it.
274,"00:24:42,320","00:24:45,563","You seem to think
I have some kind of obligation to him."
275,"00:24:46,160","00:24:48,660","Okay. Nothing could be further
from the truth."
276,"00:24:48,760","00:24:51,684","Ethan Hunt is still out there
in the field,"
277,"00:24:51,840","00:24:54,605",and I am stuck here answering for it.
278,"00:24:55,560","00:24:57,164",We are not friends.
279,"00:24:59,600","00:25:00,681",I owe him nothing.
280,"00:25:06,600","00:25:08,443","That'll be all, Dunn."
281,"00:26:07,400","00:26:09,402","Welcome to Vienna, Benji. Miss me?"
282,"00:26:09,720","00:26:12,020","Ethan, where are you?
Where the hell have you been?"
283,"00:26:12,120","00:26:13,980","You know what?
Please, don't tell me that."
284,"00:26:14,080","00:26:17,020","Because it's just another thing I'll have
to lie about in my weekly polygraph."
285,"00:26:17,120","00:26:19,100","Everything's gonna be fine.
Just keep walking."
286,"00:26:19,200","00:26:21,260",But make sure you're not being followed.
287,"00:26:21,360","00:26:23,300","I didn't win those opera tickets, did I?"
288,"00:26:23,400","00:26:24,780","No, I'm afraid not."
289,"00:26:24,880","00:26:26,245","- So, where do we meet?
- We don't."
290,"00:26:26,520","00:26:29,100","For your sake,
we shouldn't be seen together."
291,"00:26:29,200","00:26:30,247",You have mail.
292,"00:26:31,960","00:26:34,020","- Who is he?
- That's what we're here to find out."
293,"00:26:34,120","00:26:37,300","What I do know is he's our
only possible link to the Syndicate."
294,"00:26:37,400","00:26:39,846","And I have reason to believe
he's going to be here tonight."
295,"00:26:40,280","00:26:42,851",But I can't find him alone. Are you in?
296,"00:26:43,240","00:26:44,580",Are you in?
297,"00:26:44,680","00:26:46,364","Yes, of course. Of course."
298,"00:26:46,880","00:26:47,940",So what's the play?
299,"00:26:48,040","00:26:51,806","Simple. You find him. We tag him.
I follow him wherever he goes."
300,"00:26:51,920","00:26:53,060",And after that?
301,"00:26:53,160","00:26:54,580","After that, you're on a plane."
302,"00:26:54,680","00:26:57,650","Back at work Monday morning.
No one is the wiser."
303,"00:26:58,160","00:27:01,260","- Wait, that's it?
- You're in enough danger as it is"
304,"00:27:01,360","00:27:03,900","I didn't want to involve you this much,
but I had no choice."
305,"00:27:04,000","00:27:05,580","Well, if you're going to bring me
all this way,"
306,"00:27:05,680","00:27:08,763","you could at least give me something
a bit more, you know, dramatic."
307,"00:27:09,200","00:27:11,646","Benji, we're trying
to keep a low profile."
308,"00:27:12,320","00:27:15,244","You want drama, go to the opera."
309,"00:27:43,800","00:27:46,644","- Are you seeing what I'm seeing?
- Yes, I am."
310,"00:27:53,480","00:27:56,940","Am I correct in assuming
that is the Chancellor of Austria?"
311,"00:27:57,040","00:27:58,460","Yes, you are."
312,"00:27:58,560","00:28:01,340","- Did you know he was going to be here?
- No."
313,"00:28:01,440","00:28:04,380","Right. Well, we have
a European head of state here"
314,"00:28:04,480","00:28:08,260","at the same time as we are looking
for a nefarious terrorist."
315,"00:28:08,360","00:28:11,060","And I'm sure that the two things
are completely unrelated."
316,"00:28:11,160","00:28:12,140",Benji.
317,"00:28:12,240","00:28:13,810","Meanwhile, I will try and overlook
the fact that"
318,"00:28:13,920","00:28:16,540","you're an international fugitive
wanted by the CIA!"
319,"00:28:16,640","00:28:19,980","And that this little unsanctioned
operation is tantamount to treason."
320,"00:28:20,080","00:28:23,740","Because, as you stated earlier, I will be
back at my desk on Monday morning,"
321,"00:28:23,840","00:28:26,380","playing videogames,
and no one will be any the wiser."
322,"00:28:26,480","00:28:27,860","- The show's about to start, Benji.
- Right."
323,"00:28:27,960","00:28:29,180",Just take your position.
324,"00:28:29,280","00:28:30,660","- Tell me what you see.
- Okay."
325,"00:28:30,760","00:28:32,171","Nice tux, by the way."
326,"00:28:52,000","00:28:54,082","Lights ready, Act One preset."
327,"00:29:02,960","00:29:05,460",Final preparations complete.
328,"00:29:05,560","00:29:06,846",Everyone standby please.
329,"00:29:41,640","00:29:44,246",Join the IMF! See the world!
330,"00:29:44,560","00:29:47,245",On a monitor. In a closet.
331,"00:30:29,680","00:30:31,011","Okay, I have eyes."
332,"00:30:31,800","00:30:33,290",Searching.
333,"00:31:35,360","00:31:36,700","Talk to me, Benji."
334,"00:31:36,800","00:31:38,290",Nothing yet. Stand by.
335,"00:31:40,040","00:31:43,681",I know you're here. Where are you?
336,"00:31:50,000","00:31:52,844","Ethan, I might have something for you.
Can't confirm."
337,"00:31:52,960","00:31:54,689","- Where?
- Backstage. I'll direct you."
338,"00:32:02,320","00:32:04,084",Take the door on your left.
339,"00:32:04,280","00:32:06,009",He should be right in front of you.
340,"00:32:47,600","00:32:48,860","Benji, do you see that?"
341,"00:32:48,960","00:32:50,200",See what?
342,"00:32:51,000","00:32:53,731","- That woman.
- What woman? Where are you?"
343,"00:32:53,960","00:32:55,246",I can't see you.
344,"00:35:13,840","00:35:14,580",What was that?
345,"00:35:14,680","00:35:16,125",I don't know.
346,"00:35:29,960","00:35:31,962","Ethan, do you copy? Ethan, come in!"
347,"00:37:54,480","00:37:55,740","Ethan, the lighting booth!"
348,"00:37:55,840","00:37:57,205","Ethan, do you copy?"
349,"00:39:24,960","00:39:26,086",It's just a fleshwound.
350,"00:40:09,000","00:40:11,731",Seal the building. Close the exits.
351,"00:40:14,520","00:40:16,887",I have a way out. Interested?
352,"00:40:19,320","00:40:20,810",Lead the way.
353,"00:40:29,120","00:40:32,010","- Anything you want to tell me?
- No, not right now."
354,"00:40:32,600","00:40:34,841","- How's the pace?
- Don't wait for me."
355,"00:40:43,480","00:40:44,811",What's next?
356,"00:40:48,360","00:40:49,361",There.
357,"00:40:57,880","00:40:59,086",Shoes.
358,"00:40:59,760","00:41:01,250","Shoes, please."
359,"00:41:57,800","00:41:59,186",If anything were to happen to you...
360,"00:41:59,286","00:42:01,169",Nothing's going to happen to me.
361,"00:42:02,480","00:42:03,129",Stop the car.
362,"00:42:12,160","00:42:13,241",Get in!
363,"00:42:15,520","00:42:16,726","Go, go, go."
364,"00:42:25,040","00:42:27,281",What the... She tried to shoot me!
365,"00:42:27,600","00:42:29,523",That doesn't make her a bad person.
366,"00:42:30,480","00:42:31,860",I'm going to have to search you.
367,"00:42:31,960","00:42:34,540","- You have to let me go.
- Not a chance!"
368,"00:42:34,640","00:42:36,340","I assumed you were deep cover
back in London,"
369,"00:42:36,440","00:42:38,124","but isn't this taking
the role a little far?"
370,"00:42:38,240","00:42:39,700",Hang on a minute. Do you know her?
371,"00:42:39,800","00:42:41,220","We haven't been formally introduced,"
372,"00:42:41,320","00:42:43,687","but I'm pretty sure
she's British intelligence?"
373,"00:42:43,960","00:42:46,122",Ilsa Faust. You're Ethan Hunt.
374,"00:42:47,040","00:42:49,691",And that shade is very hard to find.
375,"00:42:51,000","00:42:52,300","What were you doing
at the opera tonight?"
376,"00:42:52,400","00:42:53,900",Aside from killing the Chancellor.
377,"00:42:54,000","00:42:56,340","Saving your life in London
put me in a tight spot"
378,"00:42:56,440","00:42:58,380",with some very dangerous people.
379,"00:42:58,480","00:43:00,448","I was sent to kill the Chancellor
to regain their trust."
380,"00:43:00,880","00:43:02,530",So you admit that you killed him!
381,"00:43:02,640","00:43:05,723","I went through the motions.
That's not the same thing."
382,"00:43:05,840","00:43:07,460","You thought you'd put him
in the hospital,"
383,"00:43:07,560","00:43:08,900",take him out of harm's way.
384,"00:43:09,000","00:43:10,081",Same thing you tried to do.
385,"00:43:10,520","00:43:11,540","You're not going to
believe that, are you?"
386,"00:43:11,640","00:43:12,980",What about the rest of her team?
387,"00:43:13,080","00:43:14,900",You mean those other two idiots.
388,"00:43:15,000","00:43:16,740","I can only assume
they were redundancies."
389,"00:43:16,840","00:43:19,889","In case you didn't follow through.
One man to kill the Chancellor,"
390,"00:43:21,000","00:43:22,445",the other one to kill you.
391,"00:43:22,840","00:43:25,700","- A test.
- Second one I've failed, thanks to you."
392,"00:43:25,800","00:43:28,201",And the car bomb was insurance.
393,"00:43:32,680","00:43:33,886",We have a tail.
394,"00:43:36,320","00:43:37,651",Who is he?
395,"00:43:38,160","00:43:40,260","We're after the same thing,
and I can help you."
396,"00:43:40,360","00:43:43,100","If you want to bring down the Syndicate,
you have to let me out."
397,"00:43:43,200","00:43:44,281",They're closing!
398,"00:43:46,080","00:43:48,700","This has to look like an escape,
so you just throw me out anywhere."
399,"00:43:48,800","00:43:50,450",Tell me who he is.
400,"00:43:53,560","00:43:55,403",Change of plan! Throw her out!
401,"00:43:57,840","00:43:59,729",You have everything you need to find me.
402,"00:44:15,960","00:44:19,282","Less than 24 hours after we interviewed
Benji Dunn about Ethan Hunt,"
403,"00:44:19,920","00:44:22,740","he was on a plane to Vienna
with tickets to the opera."
404,"00:44:22,840","00:44:25,740","And within six hours of his arrival,
the Chancellor was dead."
405,"00:44:25,840","00:44:28,180","Now, that might be circumstance
to some public defender,"
406,"00:44:28,280","00:44:31,220","but to the CIA,
that is actionable intelligence."
407,"00:44:31,320","00:44:33,322","Consider for the moment
the possibility that"
408,"00:44:33,440","00:44:35,820","Ethan's investigation
led him to the opera,"
409,"00:44:35,920","00:44:37,540","and that he's the one
with the actionable intelligence!"
410,"00:44:37,640","00:44:41,740","In any case, finding Hunt
is no longer a pet project."
411,"00:44:41,840","00:44:45,447","The Special Activities Division
will now have full discretion."
412,"00:44:46,600","00:44:47,681",You mean shoot to kill.
413,"00:44:48,160","00:44:52,210","Whether Hunt lives or dies
is entirely up to him."
414,"00:45:52,360","00:45:53,361",New identity.
415,"00:45:53,520","00:45:55,900","Passport, cash, move map."
416,"00:45:56,000","00:45:57,286","There's a change of clothes
in that bag right there."
417,"00:45:57,400","00:46:00,006","Everything you need
to make it to D.C. undetected."
418,"00:46:00,400","00:46:02,209","Once you're there,
you have to inform on me."
419,"00:46:02,840","00:46:04,860","- I'm sorry, what?
- Just tell the truth."
420,"00:46:04,960","00:46:07,780","You came to Vienna believing
you won two tickets to the opera."
421,"00:46:07,880","00:46:10,420","I attempted to recruit you
into assassinating the Chancellor."
422,"00:46:10,520","00:46:11,965","- You refused.
- That's not the truth!"
423,"00:46:12,080","00:46:14,420","Your life depends on
them believing you, Benji."
424,"00:46:14,520","00:46:16,740","It'll go easier
if you tell them what they want to hear."
425,"00:46:16,840","00:46:20,367","Ethan, at least tell me
what this is all about."
426,"00:46:28,440","00:46:29,885",You recognize anyone?
427,"00:46:43,200","00:46:44,260",Him.
428,"00:46:44,360","00:46:46,408",He's former KSA. German intelligence.
429,"00:46:46,560","00:46:48,050","Missing, presumed dead."
430,"00:46:49,240","00:46:50,940",He was at the opera tonight.
431,"00:46:51,040","00:46:52,451","This one, too."
432,"00:46:52,760","00:46:54,260",Former Mossad.
433,"00:46:54,360","00:46:56,010",Let me guess. Presumed dead.
434,"00:46:56,280","00:46:57,770","Tonight, I made it official."
435,"00:46:59,560","00:47:01,900",I was looking for him in the Bosphorus.
436,"00:47:02,000","00:47:05,482","The same day, a car accident
killed the visiting President of Malawi."
437,"00:47:06,760","00:47:08,569","He slipped away again in Jakarta,"
438,"00:47:09,560","00:47:12,420","hours before a passenger plane
vanished over the Pacific"
439,"00:47:12,520","00:47:14,761",with 236 passengers.
440,"00:47:16,080","00:47:17,860",I just missed him in the Philippines
441,"00:47:17,960","00:47:20,140","right before a fire
at a petrochemical plant"
442,"00:47:20,240","00:47:22,208","gassed a village of 2,000 people."
443,"00:47:24,880","00:47:27,121","You're saying these accidents
are somehow connected."
444,"00:47:29,000","00:47:31,890","That missing plane was carrying
the Secretary of the World Bank."
445,"00:47:33,960","00:47:36,611","That fire bankrupted
a global arms corporation."
446,"00:47:38,200","00:47:40,282",That wreck triggered a civil war.
447,"00:47:42,400","00:47:43,890",These are no accidents.
448,"00:47:44,920","00:47:46,100",They're links in a chain.
449,"00:47:46,200","00:47:49,443","The work of a single organization,
the Syndicate."
450,"00:47:50,280","00:47:52,620","A rogue nation,
trained to do what we do,"
451,"00:47:52,720","00:47:54,380",imbued with a new sense of purpose.
452,"00:47:54,480","00:47:58,451","Destroy the system that created them
regardless of who's in their way."
453,"00:48:00,240","00:48:01,890",An anti-IMF.
454,"00:48:02,480","00:48:06,140","Since Hunley shut us down,
they've been escalating unchecked."
455,"00:48:06,240","00:48:08,740","Killing the Chancellor tonight
was a statement,"
456,"00:48:08,840","00:48:10,490",the start of a new phase.
457,"00:48:11,040","00:48:14,681","Or they could just be
a series of random disasters."
458,"00:48:16,320","00:48:17,321",He was there.
459,"00:48:18,800","00:48:19,980",Every time.
460,"00:48:20,080","00:48:22,321","Just like he was there tonight,
I'm sure of it."
461,"00:48:23,320","00:48:26,290","I don't know who he is, where he's from,"
462,"00:48:27,000","00:48:28,900",how he's funded.
463,"00:48:29,000","00:48:30,843",But I know he's the key.
464,"00:48:31,000","00:48:34,780","Ethan, this is what I signed up for.
Let me help you find him."
465,"00:48:34,880","00:48:36,660","That's why I brought you here
in the first place,"
466,"00:48:36,760","00:48:38,260",and look what happened!
467,"00:48:38,360","00:48:39,805",I can't protect you.
468,"00:48:40,160","00:48:42,140",That's why I need you to leave.
469,"00:48:42,240","00:48:44,811","That's not your decision to make, Ethan!"
470,"00:48:45,560","00:48:48,100",I am a field agent. I know the risks.
471,"00:48:48,200","00:48:49,820","More than that, I am your friend,"
472,"00:48:49,920","00:48:51,860","no matter what I tell
the polygraph every week."
473,"00:48:51,960","00:48:54,900","Now, you called me
because you needed my help."
474,"00:48:55,000","00:48:57,321",And you still do. So I am staying.
475,"00:48:58,200","00:49:00,521","And that is all
we are going to say about that."
476,"00:49:04,720","00:49:05,721",Okay.
477,"00:49:07,040","00:49:08,087",Good.
478,"00:49:09,880","00:49:11,041",Where do we start?
479,"00:49:13,240","00:49:14,401",Ilsa.
480,"00:49:17,000","00:49:19,048",Right. And how do we find her?
481,"00:49:19,560","00:49:21,608",She said we have everything we need.
482,"00:50:01,640","00:50:03,580",We had an agreement.
483,"00:50:03,680","00:50:07,100","You send me to do a job, I do it.
But my way, not yours."
484,"00:50:07,200","00:50:08,540",Where did I deviate?
485,"00:50:08,640","00:50:10,620","You put two more gunmen
at the opera tonight."
486,"00:50:10,720","00:50:11,926",One of them tried to kill me.
487,"00:50:12,320","00:50:13,460",You missed.
488,"00:50:13,560","00:50:16,180","I missed because Ethan Hunt was there
looking for you."
489,"00:50:16,280","00:50:19,620","Ethan Hunt's in Vienna because
you allowed him to escape in London."
490,"00:50:19,720","00:50:22,929","Vinter would have killed him in London,
and that's not what you asked for."
491,"00:50:23,840","00:50:26,286",Twice now you've let him slip away.
492,"00:50:28,000","00:50:29,126",Curious.
493,"00:50:29,440","00:50:32,364","Are you questioning my loyalty
or my ability?"
494,"00:50:33,840","00:50:37,731","- Can't decide.
- I've told you before, trust me or kill me."
495,"00:50:38,280","00:50:40,009","But if you're going to kill me,
be a man."
496,"00:50:42,240","00:50:43,765",Do it yourself.
497,"00:51:12,320","00:51:14,049",Did he say anything?
498,"00:51:15,480","00:51:17,448",He knows about Morocco.
499,"00:51:17,880","00:51:19,689",What does he know about Morocco?
500,"00:51:20,320","00:51:24,166","He knows about the power plant.
He doesn't know what's in it."
501,"00:51:25,800","00:51:27,006","Find him, please."
502,"00:51:28,840","00:51:30,285",He'll find me.
503,"00:51:31,560","00:51:33,164",I've seen to that.
504,"00:51:38,400","00:51:39,700",That's interesting.
505,"00:51:39,800","00:51:41,300","- What is it?
- It's a skiff."
506,"00:51:41,400","00:51:44,244","A secure computer facility.
Offline, ultra-contained."
507,"00:51:44,360","00:51:46,260","It's impossible to hack into
from the outside."
508,"00:51:46,360","00:51:48,931","It's essentially
a digital safety deposit box."
509,"00:51:49,040","00:51:52,362","Very strange thing for a young lady
to be carrying in her sundries."
510,"00:51:52,680","00:51:53,920",Where's it located?
511,"00:51:55,200","00:51:56,281",Morocco.
512,"00:51:58,360","00:51:59,600",Morocco.
513,"00:53:15,600","00:53:18,080","And what brings you gentlemen
to Casablanca?"
514,"00:53:48,920","00:53:50,060",Good to see you.
515,"00:53:50,160","00:53:52,481","What couldn't you tell me
over the phone?"
516,"00:53:54,440","00:53:56,980","The Chancellor of Austria
was assassinated."
517,"00:53:57,080","00:53:59,765","We believe that
Ethan and Benji were there."
518,"00:54:00,000","00:54:03,163","Hunley has handed this over
to the Special Activities Division."
519,"00:54:04,160","00:54:06,606",We need to find Ethan before they do.
520,"00:54:07,680","00:54:09,205",And that's where you come in.
521,"00:54:11,400","00:54:12,765",Not interested.
522,"00:54:13,520","00:54:16,683","- Okay, look, Luther...
- Look, man, I know Ethan."
523,"00:54:16,960","00:54:18,200",I don't know you.
524,"00:54:19,120","00:54:21,900","All I know about you
is that you chose to work for Hunley."
525,"00:54:22,000","00:54:24,526","All I know about you
is you chose to resign."
526,"00:54:25,720","00:54:29,420","You don't have to worry about Ethan.
They'll never catch him."
527,"00:54:29,520","00:54:31,260","No, they're not gonna catch him. No."
528,"00:54:31,360","00:54:33,740","This is the CIA.
This is Hunley we're talking about."
529,"00:54:33,840","00:54:36,969","Things are out of control.
No, they're going to kill him."
530,"00:54:38,040","00:54:40,611","They're going to kill Ethan.
They're going to kill Benji."
531,"00:54:41,360","00:54:44,091","We have to get to them first.
Are you going to help me?"
532,"00:54:51,520","00:54:53,249",You need to understand something.
533,"00:54:55,120","00:54:56,884",Ethan is my friend.
534,"00:54:57,920","00:55:01,049","And if I have one second of doubt
whose side you're on..."
535,"00:55:04,720","00:55:06,165",I believe you.
536,"00:55:07,880","00:55:09,740","- All right.
- All right."
537,"00:55:09,840","00:55:10,887",What do I have to go on?
538,"00:55:11,800","00:55:14,485",Not much. And not a lot of time.
539,"00:55:16,920","00:55:18,445",His name is Solomon Lane.
540,"00:55:19,720","00:55:20,960",He created the Syndicate.
541,"00:55:21,680","00:55:22,761",Where does he come from?
542,"00:55:24,200","00:55:25,884",He's former British intelligence.
543,"00:55:27,360","00:55:29,660","Well, if British intelligence knows
the Syndicate exists,"
544,"00:55:29,760","00:55:31,820",why don't they just tell the CIA?
545,"00:55:31,920","00:55:33,660",Because they don't want anyone knowing
546,"00:55:33,760","00:55:36,730","the Syndicate was created
by one of their own."
547,"00:55:37,600","00:55:40,331","I was sent undercover
to earn Lane's trust"
548,"00:55:40,440","00:55:43,660","and eventually identify the members
of his organization."
549,"00:55:43,760","00:55:47,924","And for the first time in two years,
I'm close to knowing who they are."
550,"00:55:48,760","00:55:50,260",Lane had a ledger.
551,"00:55:50,360","00:55:54,445","It contained the identities
of his operatives, his terrorist associates,"
552,"00:55:54,560","00:55:57,220","the entire inner workings
of the Syndicate."
553,"00:55:57,320","00:56:00,340","One of his agents stole it,
hoping to blackmail him,"
554,"00:56:00,440","00:56:04,540","and kept it in a secure computer facility
for safekeeping."
555,"00:56:04,640","00:56:07,340","He died being interrogated
for the access code,"
556,"00:56:07,440","00:56:09,169",leaving Lane with a serious problem.
557,"00:56:11,440","00:56:13,860",So the key to crushing Lane
558,"00:56:13,960","00:56:16,964","is sitting in a computer,
just waiting for someone to take it."
559,"00:56:18,080","00:56:21,448","So, why hasn't Lane
just sent someone to steal it?"
560,"00:56:22,240","00:56:23,526",He has.
561,"00:56:24,120","00:56:25,645",He sent me.
562,"00:56:26,680","00:56:27,806",And I can tell you
563,"00:56:29,480","00:56:30,811",it's impossible.
564,"00:56:35,040","00:56:38,500","The facility's hidden beneath
a local power plant under military guard."
565,"00:56:38,600","00:56:40,364",And the only way to download the ledger
566,"00:56:40,480","00:56:43,324","is through the central
computer terminal, located there."
567,"00:56:44,880","00:56:47,042","To reach the terminal,
you'll need to pass the main gate,"
568,"00:56:48,880","00:56:51,042","access the elevator
with fingerprint recognition,"
569,"00:56:52,840","00:56:55,320","and open
three separate combination locks."
570,"00:57:01,280","00:57:03,140","Well, that's easy.
We just impersonate the agent"
571,"00:57:03,240","00:57:06,005","who stole the ledger in the first place,
and I get to wear a mask!"
572,"00:57:29,160","00:57:31,686","Unfortunately, even if you could
make it through"
573,"00:57:31,800","00:57:34,610","every other security measure,
you won't beat the last one."
574,"00:57:35,040","00:57:37,260","That's because it's protected
by gait analysis."
575,"00:57:37,360","00:57:39,567",The step beyond facial recognition.
576,"00:57:39,680","00:57:42,180","These cameras actually know
how the agent walks,"
577,"00:57:42,280","00:57:43,884","how he talks, how he moves."
578,"00:57:44,320","00:57:46,209",Right down to his facial tics.
579,"00:57:54,040","00:57:56,088","So, what you're saying is
no mask can beat it."
580,"00:57:56,200","00:57:57,420","We're busted before we even get
into the vault,"
581,"00:57:57,520","00:57:58,860","and I wind up in a Moroccan jail,"
582,"00:57:58,960","00:58:01,540","playing mummies and daddies
with Ahmad the Strangler."
583,"00:58:01,640","00:58:03,210","Okay, I don't get to wear a mask."
584,"00:58:03,760","00:58:05,340","And there's no other way
into the computer lab?"
585,"00:58:05,440","00:58:06,660",No other way in.
586,"00:58:06,760","00:58:08,922","- Air shaft?
- Six-inch-diameter pipe."
587,"00:58:09,040","00:58:09,980",Foundation?
588,"00:58:10,080","00:58:11,889","Twelve feet of concrete, top and bottom."
589,"00:58:12,880","00:58:13,820","- Electrical conduit.
- Electrical conduit."
590,"00:58:13,920","00:58:15,604","Bottom line is there's no way
into that terminal"
591,"00:58:15,720","00:58:19,008","unless your profile is preinstalled
in the security system."
592,"00:58:20,880","00:58:22,086",Profile.
593,"00:58:22,960","00:58:24,007",Where are the profiles stored?
594,"00:58:24,560","00:58:28,326","All security data is stored offline
in the liquid-cooled array."
595,"00:58:28,760","00:58:30,922","Here, inside the torus."
596,"00:58:31,040","00:58:33,441","Liquid-cooled.
You mean that thing is underwater?"
597,"00:58:33,760","00:58:35,046","- Yes.
- Yes."
598,"00:58:36,040","00:58:38,327","Okay. So, to get the ledger,"
599,"00:58:38,640","00:58:40,165",one of us needs to enter the torus
600,"00:58:41,840","00:58:43,842","and change the security profile,"
601,"00:58:45,920","00:58:48,844","so that the other one can access
the computer without being caught."
602,"00:58:51,040","00:58:53,520","- That's the only way.
- That's the only way."
603,"00:58:56,000","00:58:57,780",Can I get in through there? What's that?
604,"00:58:57,880","00:59:01,123","That's the service hatch.
It can only be opened from the inside."
605,"00:59:01,440","00:59:02,980","If you try and open it from the outside,"
606,"00:59:03,080","00:59:06,180","you'd be hit with 70,000 gallons
of pressurized water."
607,"00:59:06,280","00:59:07,406",Where does the water come from?
608,"00:59:07,520","00:59:10,860","Desalinized seawater flows through
the intake, in the power plant."
609,"00:59:10,960","00:59:13,980","And, before you ask, the system
is designed to shut down automatically"
610,"00:59:14,080","00:59:16,003",if any metal enters the intake.
611,"00:59:17,400","00:59:18,561",No oxygen tanks.
612,"00:59:21,400","00:59:24,100","All right.
Well, how long will it take to free swim"
613,"00:59:24,200","00:59:25,740",from the intake to the service hatch?
614,"00:59:25,840","00:59:27,780","Two minutes,
with the current at full power."
615,"00:59:27,880","00:59:29,928","Then you just have to hold your breath
for two minutes."
616,"00:59:30,720","00:59:32,180","What about installing
the security profile?"
617,"00:59:32,280","00:59:34,380","Well, that's gonna be, like,
a minute, tops."
618,"00:59:34,480","00:59:36,084","So I have to hold my breath
for three minutes."
619,"00:59:36,480","00:59:37,641",You can do that.
620,"00:59:37,760","00:59:39,842","What I think you're overlooking
is the physical exertion."
621,"00:59:40,000","00:59:42,970","The more you exert yourself,
the faster you consume oxygen."
622,"00:59:43,120","00:59:46,660","Don't worry about him, all right?
All he has to do is install the fake profile"
623,"00:59:46,760","00:59:50,242","before I get to the gait analysis.
You said it yourself, it's the only way."
624,"00:59:50,800","00:59:52,211",That doesn't sound impossible.
625,"00:59:56,720","00:59:59,500","Satellite overwatch
covering all seven continents."
626,"00:59:59,600","01:00:03,241","DNA profiling, facial recognition,
drone surveillance, drone strikes."
627,"01:00:03,360","01:00:05,966","So, how are we supposed to find
Ethan and Benji before they do?"
628,"01:00:06,360","01:00:09,091","I'm not even looking for them.
I'm looking for her."
629,"01:00:10,200","01:00:11,531",What do you mean?
630,"01:00:12,520","01:00:15,126",These sketches. What do you see?
631,"01:00:17,320","01:00:19,721","Ethan's not exactly sure
who this guy is."
632,"01:00:21,920","01:00:23,206",But this woman...
633,"01:00:24,520","01:00:26,602","- He knows her.
- He trusts her."
634,"01:00:27,480","01:00:29,847","I'm betting that if he's not already
with her, he's on his way."
635,"01:00:30,120","01:00:31,540","Find her, find Ethan."
636,"01:00:31,640","01:00:34,041","Tell me it's possible to pull
facial recognition off a sketch."
637,"01:00:34,160","01:00:35,740","For mere mortals, no."
638,"01:00:35,840","01:00:38,889","- For me, I could've done this at home.
- All right."
639,"01:00:43,960","01:00:45,371","- How long is this gonna take?
- Found her."
640,"01:00:49,160","01:00:52,562","CCTV picked her up
at the airport in Casablanca."
641,"01:00:54,080","01:00:55,445",What the hell?
642,"01:00:57,080","01:00:58,491",She's bad news.
643,"01:01:27,960","01:01:28,961",Sorry.
644,"01:01:59,480","01:02:00,700",Your card isn't working.
645,"01:02:00,800","01:02:02,131","Benji, we're in."
646,"01:02:45,960","01:02:48,361","One more time.
You'll have three minutes."
647,"01:02:49,360","01:02:52,300","Two and a half minutes
to switch the security profile."
648,"01:02:52,400","01:02:54,721","Thirty seconds to escape
through the service hatch."
649,"01:02:55,440","01:02:57,260","Remember, conserve oxygen."
650,"01:02:57,360","01:02:59,283","Don't move a muscle
if you don't have to."
651,"01:03:17,920","01:03:19,684",I'm in the elevator.
652,"01:03:30,480","01:03:32,900","That current will carry you
to the torus."
653,"01:03:33,000","01:03:34,729","Once you're there, I'll shut it down."
654,"01:03:35,720","01:03:39,380","Important note.
The profile is in slot 108."
655,"01:03:39,480","01:03:42,802","And a slightly more important note.
If you haven't switched that profile"
656,"01:03:42,920","01:03:45,400","before I reach the gait analysis,
I'm dead."
657,"01:03:46,000","01:03:47,331","Thank you, Benji."
658,"01:04:56,960","01:04:58,060",What's the problem?
659,"01:04:58,160","01:05:01,369","The cooling system's
rebooting by itself."
660,"01:06:26,920","01:06:27,921",All systems normal.
661,"01:06:28,560","01:06:30,164",Cooling system's at full power.
662,"01:06:36,400","01:06:38,368","No, no, no."
663,"01:10:05,840","01:10:07,180",You're all right.
664,"01:10:07,280","01:10:08,645",You're okay.
665,"01:10:09,280","01:10:10,930",You see? What did I tell you?
666,"01:10:11,200","01:10:13,771","Difficult? Absolutely.
But certainly not..."
667,"01:10:15,840","01:10:18,525",Jesus. Is he all right? What happened?
668,"01:10:31,400","01:10:32,731",Okay.
669,"01:10:33,920","01:10:34,921",Here.
670,"01:10:36,800","01:10:38,006",Hey.
671,"01:10:38,320","01:10:39,685",I misjudged you.
672,"01:10:45,520","01:10:47,602","Hey, man. You okay? How you doing?"
673,"01:10:48,040","01:10:49,280","Hey, buddy."
674,"01:10:50,440","01:10:53,444","- Benji.
- Yeah, Benji. You did good."
675,"01:10:54,080","01:10:56,060","You take a moment, all right?
Just take a moment."
676,"01:10:56,160","01:10:58,700","There's nothing a little sunshine
and fresh air won't fix."
677,"01:10:58,800","01:11:00,882","- You'll be right as rain.
- What are you doing here?"
678,"01:11:01,760","01:11:02,921","Look, look."
679,"01:11:03,480","01:11:04,527",We got it.
680,"01:11:05,160","01:11:06,525",I knew we'd get it.
681,"01:11:08,880","01:11:10,420","Listen, I don't want to
sound ungrateful, okay?"
682,"01:11:10,520","01:11:12,460","I appreciate everything you do for me,"
683,"01:11:12,560","01:11:15,370","but one of these days,
you're going to take it too far."
684,"01:11:16,880","01:11:18,245",We got it!
685,"01:11:18,600","01:11:19,931",We're gonna nail that...
686,"01:11:29,800","01:11:31,370","Wait, wait..."
687,"01:11:34,880","01:11:37,740","- I thought you said you could find him.
- I said I could locate him."
688,"01:11:37,840","01:11:39,649","- You have to find him.
- Right."
689,"01:11:59,120","01:12:00,565",Where's Hunt?
690,"01:12:07,000","01:12:08,001",He's dead.
691,"01:12:08,400","01:12:09,740",That really hurts!
692,"01:12:09,840","01:12:11,020","- Can you walk?
- Yes."
693,"01:12:11,120","01:12:13,851",We have to get to her before Lane does.
694,"01:13:04,600","01:13:07,729","Are you okay to drive?
A minute ago you were dead."
695,"01:13:08,160","01:13:09,446",What are you talking about?
696,"01:13:10,640","01:13:12,005",This is not going to end well.
697,"01:13:22,800","01:13:24,006",There she is!
698,"01:13:34,960","01:13:38,851","Stairs, stairs, stairs!"
699,"01:13:41,680","01:13:42,841",God damn it!
700,"01:14:27,040","01:14:28,041",We found him.
701,"01:14:29,560","01:14:30,721","Come on, man!"
702,"01:14:34,320","01:14:35,481",Shit!
703,"01:14:36,800","01:14:38,086",It's a high-speed chase!
704,"01:14:38,320","01:14:40,380","You just had to get the four-by-four,
didn't you?"
705,"01:14:40,480","01:14:43,140","- Don't blame me. You chose the car.
- You just had to have it!"
706,"01:14:43,240","01:14:45,540","- Do you want me to drive?
- Look at this thing!"
707,"01:14:45,640","01:14:47,483","Look how slow you're going.
Speed it up!"
708,"01:14:52,920","01:14:53,921",Who's this guy?
709,"01:14:56,160","01:14:57,161",Shit!
710,"01:15:24,560","01:15:25,561",Go! Go! Go!
711,"01:15:29,640","01:15:31,290",I'm okay! I'm okay! I'm okay!
712,"01:15:48,240","01:15:50,971","Here they come!
What are we gonna do?"
713,"01:16:04,920","01:16:05,921",Gun!
714,"01:16:09,560","01:16:12,166","- Do you have your seatbelt on?
- You're asking me that now?"
715,"01:16:20,320","01:16:21,685",Hang on!
716,"01:17:01,480","01:17:02,481",We good?
717,"01:17:03,360","01:17:05,567",Things got a little out of hand.
718,"01:17:06,360","01:17:07,725",Look out!
719,"01:17:13,800","01:17:15,086",We're good?
720,"01:17:23,880","01:17:25,041","Hey, boys, what did I miss?"
721,"01:17:31,080","01:17:32,570",That looks sharp. Careful! Careful!
722,"01:21:16,280","01:21:17,441",So what do we do now?
723,"01:21:20,440","01:21:23,489","Please tell me
you made a copy of that disk."
724,"01:21:26,080","01:21:28,048",Of course I made a copy.
725,"01:21:35,960","01:21:37,485",So where are we going?
726,"01:22:02,080","01:22:05,420","It's a ledger.
The Syndicate's entire infrastructure."
727,"01:22:05,520","01:22:06,980","Who they are,
the politicians they control,"
728,"01:22:07,080","01:22:10,402","and where the money comes from.
It's everything you want to know."
729,"01:22:11,560","01:22:15,087","What makes you think
this so-called ledger is authentic?"
730,"01:22:15,600","01:22:18,220","Why would Lane want it so badly
if it wasn't authentic?"
731,"01:22:18,320","01:22:20,482","Why would he ever
let you have it if it was?"
732,"01:22:20,720","01:22:24,088","Did you never stop to consider
that he may want me to have it?"
733,"01:22:24,200","01:22:26,620","Misinformation, manipulation,
it's what he does, Ilsa."
734,"01:22:26,720","01:22:28,340",It's what he's trained to do.
735,"01:22:28,440","01:22:31,540","Lane lies to you,
you sell these lies to Hunt."
736,"01:22:31,640","01:22:34,803","Together, you're both compromised.
That's his ultimate objective."
737,"01:22:35,800","01:22:37,040",This may be authentic.
738,"01:22:37,680","01:22:41,844","But there's only one person I trust
to verify that information. You."
739,"01:22:44,360","01:22:45,600",No.
740,"01:22:47,120","01:22:50,020","My orders were to deliver you
information regarding the Syndicate."
741,"01:22:50,120","01:22:51,740","Your orders were
to infiltrate the Syndicate"
742,"01:22:51,840","01:22:55,003","that we may learn more
about them firsthand."
743,"01:22:55,160","01:22:57,500","This isn't proof.
It's a test, like everything else."
744,"01:22:57,600","01:23:00,001",The only way to pass is to go back.
745,"01:23:00,120","01:23:04,140","I can't do that. I've betrayed
Lane's trust too many times."
746,"01:23:04,240","01:23:06,700","And in every instance,
you did so on your own volition."
747,"01:23:06,800","01:23:09,420","He was going to torture and kill
an American agent."
748,"01:23:09,520","01:23:12,900","And you should have let him.
Then you would still have Lane's trust."
749,"01:23:13,000","01:23:15,140","This is the trade.
Hunt understands that."
750,"01:23:15,240","01:23:17,660","I wasn't going to let him die.
He's our ally."
751,"01:23:17,760","01:23:21,845","There are no allies in statecraft, Ilsa,
only common interests."
752,"01:23:22,240","01:23:25,289","As it stands, Ethan Hunt is a man
without a country."
753,"01:23:26,040","01:23:29,931","This makes killing him
decidedly less complicated."
754,"01:23:31,760","01:23:33,660",Are you ordering me to kill Hunt?
755,"01:23:33,760","01:23:36,081","Good God, no.
Nothing so crude as that. No."
756,"01:23:37,320","01:23:38,845",Lane will order you.
757,"01:23:39,520","01:23:42,205","And to regain his trust,"
758,"01:23:42,800","01:23:44,370",you will do it.
759,"01:23:45,280","01:23:49,763",You sent me to do a job. I did it.
760,"01:23:50,640","01:23:52,500",Now you bring me in!
761,"01:23:52,600","01:23:55,285","Might I remind you,
you are without a country of your own?"
762,"01:23:57,160","01:24:00,323","The Director of the CIA called me,
inquiring about you personally."
763,"01:24:00,440","01:24:02,700","Of course, to protect your cover,
I had to lie."
764,"01:24:02,800","01:24:04,340","So, as far as the Americans
are concerned,"
765,"01:24:04,440","01:24:07,284","you're a rogue assassin,
a target of opportunity."
766,"01:24:08,280","01:24:11,420","Precious few people know
about your true identity."
767,"01:24:11,520","01:24:15,809",It would be unfortunate if we forgot.
768,"01:24:17,280","01:24:19,806","You see, there really is
no choice, Ilsa."
769,"01:24:20,280","01:24:21,850",You're going back.
770,"01:24:29,800","01:24:32,167",Glad to know you're still with us.
771,"01:24:41,120","01:24:43,282","- What's happening?
- I can't open it."
772,"01:24:43,720","01:24:47,220","- What do you mean, you can't open it?
- I mean I can't open it, ever."
773,"01:24:47,320","01:24:48,900",That's a red box.
774,"01:24:49,000","01:24:50,684","- A what?
- It's a red box."
775,"01:24:50,960","01:24:53,201","The British government uses them
to transport state secrets."
776,"01:24:53,840","01:24:56,300","- Doesn't sound good.
- Meaning it's triple-encrypted."
777,"01:24:56,400","01:24:59,620","You're not getting into that thing unless
you have fingerprints, retinal scan,"
778,"01:24:59,720","01:25:03,088","and a voice phrase spoken
by a specific individual."
779,"01:25:03,200","01:25:05,140","The Prime Minister
of Great Britain himself."
780,"01:25:05,240","01:25:06,380","Yes, him."
781,"01:25:06,480","01:25:08,580","So what you're saying is
there is no ledger,"
782,"01:25:08,680","01:25:11,060","which means we have no proof
that the Syndicate even exists."
783,"01:25:11,160","01:25:14,687","So we're back to square one,
only now we are all wanted by the CIA."
784,"01:25:15,360","01:25:17,140",I'm so proud of us.
785,"01:25:17,240","01:25:19,641","What I don't understand is
why is there a red box"
786,"01:25:19,760","01:25:22,206",sat in a private data vault in Morocco?
787,"01:25:22,800","01:25:24,940","And why would Lane want it
if he can't open it?"
788,"01:25:25,040","01:25:27,930","If Lane wants it,
you can bet he has a plan to open it."
789,"01:25:29,800","01:25:31,040",And we just helped him steal it.
790,"01:25:35,400","01:25:36,970",He's going to take the Prime Minister.
791,"01:25:37,360","01:25:40,364","Yes, he is. The question is how."
792,"01:25:40,560","01:25:42,060","Well, we have to warn
the British government."
793,"01:25:42,160","01:25:43,300","Yeah, MI6."
794,"01:25:43,400","01:25:46,220","No, Brandt. Put down the phone.
Let's think about this for a minute."
795,"01:25:46,320","01:25:48,300","We have a responsibility
to warn the British government"
796,"01:25:48,400","01:25:51,580","and not gamble
with the Prime Minister's life, Ethan,"
797,"01:25:51,680","01:25:56,129","just so you can beat the guy
that has beaten you at every turn."
798,"01:25:58,520","01:26:00,124",Is that what you think this is?
799,"01:26:00,840","01:26:02,001",Brandt?
800,"01:26:04,760","01:26:06,410",Is that what you think this is?
801,"01:26:07,760","01:26:11,060","I think right now you're incapable
of seeing that there is another way."
802,"01:26:11,160","01:26:14,780","And sometimes Ethan is the only one
capable of seeing the only way."
803,"01:26:14,880","01:26:18,123","And if he is wrong,
then we have Vienna all over again!"
804,"01:26:18,440","01:26:19,420",You don't know him.
805,"01:26:19,520","01:26:22,500","If he wants something to happen,
there is no preventing it!"
806,"01:26:22,600","01:26:24,500",That's why we have to warn the British.
807,"01:26:24,600","01:26:26,820","Maybe that's exactly
what he wants us to do."
808,"01:26:26,920","01:26:29,321","Are you listening to yourself?
We are going to warn the British."
809,"01:26:29,440","01:26:31,700","No. We're going to find Lane,
we're going to get him,"
810,"01:26:31,800","01:26:34,121",before he takes the Prime Minister.
811,"01:26:39,120","01:26:40,281",Okay.
812,"01:26:40,680","01:26:42,808","All right, Ethan.
We're going to find Lane."
813,"01:26:43,600","01:26:46,444","But please tell me
how are we going to do that?"
814,"01:27:26,480","01:27:27,766",All is forgiven.
815,"01:27:28,280","01:27:30,089","That isn't a ledger, is it?"
816,"01:27:30,440","01:27:32,124",You didn't take a look for yourself?
817,"01:27:32,680","01:27:35,251","Of course I did,
but the file was encrypted."
818,"01:27:35,840","01:27:37,410",And why would I lie to you?
819,"01:27:37,520","01:27:39,488",So that I would lie to Hunt.
820,"01:27:40,920","01:27:43,605","But he wouldn't have stolen it
if he knew what it was."
821,"01:27:45,000","01:27:46,923",And you wouldn't have helped him.
822,"01:27:48,840","01:27:50,604",What is actually on that disk?
823,"01:27:50,840","01:27:53,969","I'll be honest with you
when you start being honest with me."
824,"01:27:55,440","01:27:59,001","Now, you and I both know
why you've come back. Don't we?"
825,"01:28:02,160","01:28:04,900","You're still alive
because I believe in your potential."
826,"01:28:05,000","01:28:06,889",But I'm growing impatient.
827,"01:28:08,440","01:28:10,522",Why do you continue to resist?
828,"01:28:14,880","01:28:18,487","Well, if we're being honest,
you're a terrorist."
829,"01:28:19,040","01:28:21,460","If that were true,
my goal would be to spread fear."
830,"01:28:21,560","01:28:25,724",But my method is far more surgical.
831,"01:28:28,160","01:28:29,650",You kill innocent people.
832,"01:28:30,200","01:28:33,100","I helped my government kill
many innocent people and more."
833,"01:28:33,200","01:28:34,884",So much more.
834,"01:28:35,880","01:28:38,042",Killing to keep things as they were.
835,"01:28:38,840","01:28:41,650","And now I'm killing
to bring about change."
836,"01:28:42,920","01:28:45,161",I think Ethan Hunt would disagree.
837,"01:28:45,600","01:28:49,400","Ethan Hunt is a gambler.
And one day his luck will run out,"
838,"01:28:50,000","01:28:52,970","and thousands of innocent people
will pay the price."
839,"01:28:53,840","01:28:55,842","Which one of us
will be the villain then?"
840,"01:28:59,920","01:29:02,127",Nothing here. It's empty.
841,"01:29:18,800","01:29:21,610",I'm interested to see who you blame
842,"01:29:23,760","01:29:25,410",for what happens next.
843,"01:30:13,040","01:30:14,121",So that's her?
844,"01:30:14,480","01:30:15,606",That's her.
845,"01:30:19,440","01:30:23,604",I have to say you sure can ride.
846,"01:30:26,840","01:30:29,002","- Ethan...
- You were just doing your job."
847,"01:30:30,360","01:30:31,725",That's all we're going to say about it.
848,"01:30:34,080","01:30:35,730",Atlee said you would understand.
849,"01:30:35,920","01:30:38,491","Atlee. Your handler
in British intelligence."
850,"01:30:42,360","01:30:44,283","And he didn't bring you in,"
851,"01:30:46,200","01:30:47,690",even after you gave him the disk.
852,"01:30:48,960","01:30:51,201",You knew perfectly well it was blank.
853,"01:30:52,040","01:30:53,180",That's a lie.
854,"01:30:53,280","01:30:55,740","The disk she took from me
was an exact copy. I'm sure of it."
855,"01:30:55,840","01:30:58,207","Was it in your possession
the entire time?"
856,"01:31:10,400","01:31:13,131",They don't care if you live or die.
857,"01:31:20,560","01:31:22,881","But you knew
I was going to take it to him."
858,"01:31:23,720","01:31:26,849","I hoped you would.
I hoped it'd be enough to get you out."
859,"01:31:28,800","01:31:30,882","That means Lane doesn't have the disk.
Only we do."
860,"01:31:31,320","01:31:32,380",I have a question.
861,"01:31:32,480","01:31:35,962","If the disk was blank,
why is she still alive?"
862,"01:31:36,560","01:31:39,882","Unless, of course,
Lane wanted us to find her."
863,"01:31:42,160","01:31:43,571",So who you working for now?
864,"01:31:45,000","01:31:48,641","Lane, Atlee, your government,
my government, they're all the same."
865,"01:31:49,280","01:31:50,940","We only think
we're fighting for the right side"
866,"01:31:51,040","01:31:52,929","because that's what
we choose to believe."
867,"01:31:54,600","01:31:56,125",So where does that leave us?
868,"01:31:56,560","01:31:59,086","The way I see it,
you have three choices."
869,"01:31:59,440","01:32:02,649","One, you hand me
and the disk over to the CIA."
870,"01:32:03,280","01:32:04,964",I am proof the Syndicate exists.
871,"01:32:05,080","01:32:08,323","Lane becomes their problem
and your work is done."
872,"01:32:08,480","01:32:10,562","- My thoughts exactly.
- Works for me."
873,"01:32:11,120","01:32:12,531","But you know
they're not gonna believe you."
874,"01:32:13,240","01:32:15,129",And you'll all be tried for treason.
875,"01:32:15,960","01:32:17,041",Lane goes free.
876,"01:32:17,440","01:32:19,090",I'm afraid she has a point.
877,"01:32:19,360","01:32:22,648","Two, you let me walk away
to an uncertain fate."
878,"01:32:23,680","01:32:26,331",You use the disk as bait to trap Lane.
879,"01:32:27,320","01:32:30,220","But some part of you suspects
you've met your match."
880,"01:32:30,320","01:32:33,020","And being a gambler, you'll probably
end up handing Lane that disk,"
881,"01:32:33,120","01:32:34,724",whether you want to or not.
882,"01:32:35,320","01:32:36,970",That is entirely possible.
883,"01:32:37,840","01:32:39,001",And option three?
884,"01:32:39,800","01:32:41,131",Come away with me.
885,"01:32:42,800","01:32:44,165",Right now.
886,"01:32:47,480","01:32:49,130","Oh, boy."
887,"01:32:52,800","01:32:54,006",And what about Lane?
888,"01:32:54,640","01:32:56,130",Forget about Lane.
889,"01:32:56,920","01:32:58,684",There will always be another Lane.
890,"01:32:59,280","01:33:01,965","There will always be people like us
to face him."
891,"01:33:03,000","01:33:06,163","We've done our part
and we've been cast aside."
892,"01:33:07,080","01:33:09,162",We can be anyone.
893,"01:33:09,680","01:33:11,682",We can do anything.
894,"01:33:13,520","01:33:15,682",It's only a matter of going.
895,"01:33:28,920","01:33:31,764","Lane sent you to deliver a message,
didn't he?"
896,"01:33:32,680","01:33:34,728","I've saved your life twice.
I won't be able to do it again."
897,"01:33:35,680","01:33:37,170",What's the message?
898,"01:33:50,280","01:33:51,361",Benji.
899,"01:34:04,040","01:34:05,540",Parking garage.
900,"01:34:05,640","01:34:07,290","Luther, stay with her!"
901,"01:34:31,560","01:34:33,722",She's gone. I lost her.
902,"01:34:37,200","01:34:38,725","She set us up, Ethan."
903,"01:34:39,560","01:34:41,380",No. She delivered a message.
904,"01:34:41,480","01:34:44,340","She set us up!
She knew this would happen!"
905,"01:34:44,440","01:34:47,284",Only Lane knows what's going to happen!
906,"01:34:53,120","01:34:55,020","I have a job for you, Ethan."
907,"01:34:55,120","01:34:57,805","And for the sake of your friend,
you will do it."
908,"01:34:57,920","01:34:58,900",I'm listening.
909,"01:34:59,000","01:35:02,020","Your mission,
should you choose to accept it,"
910,"01:35:02,120","01:35:05,700","is to bring me the unlocked disk
by midnight tonight."
911,"01:35:05,800","01:35:07,450","Now say the words, please."
912,"01:35:08,720","01:35:10,210",I accept.
913,"01:35:11,200","01:35:12,361",Yes.
914,"01:35:15,280","01:35:16,520",I knew you would.
915,"01:35:23,960","01:35:28,648","He wants the disk, unlocked,
by midnight tonight."
916,"01:35:28,880","01:35:33,169","Ethan, there's only one person on Earth
who can unlock that disk."
917,"01:35:34,840","01:35:37,002",We have to take the Prime Minister.
918,"01:35:38,160","01:35:40,481","Let's just think
about that for a minute."
919,"01:35:42,000","01:35:44,220",It's the only way to get Benji back.
920,"01:35:44,320","01:35:47,164","Ethan, that's exactly
what Lane wants you to do."
921,"01:35:48,000","01:35:50,651",Which is why it has to happen.
922,"01:35:55,520","01:35:57,329",This is how we beat Lane.
923,"01:35:58,240","01:36:00,004",This is how we make everything right.
924,"01:36:00,320","01:36:01,606",Can you see?
925,"01:36:02,840","01:36:04,365",Can't you see it?
926,"01:36:18,200","01:36:21,363","William Brandt, sir.
He says it's urgent."
927,"01:36:26,440","01:36:28,442","I had a feeling
you'd come to your senses, Brandt."
928,"01:36:28,720","01:36:31,100","I'm only calling you
because I have no other choice."
929,"01:36:31,200","01:36:32,860",I'm trying to prevent a catastrophe.
930,"01:36:32,960","01:36:34,883",I can understand that. Where are you?
931,"01:36:37,200","01:36:40,204","- London.
- Reroute us to London now."
932,"01:36:40,560","01:36:43,291","- Where in London?
- I'll tell you when you land, not before."
933,"01:36:43,400","01:36:45,482","I'm not interested
in playing games, Brandt."
934,"01:36:45,680","01:36:48,420","And I'm not interested
in seeing my friends get killed either."
935,"01:36:48,520","01:36:50,900","So if I'm going to betray them,
we're going do this on my terms"
936,"01:36:51,000","01:36:52,780",and my terms only. Do you understand?
937,"01:36:52,880","01:36:55,247","Keep your phone on.
Instructions will follow."
938,"01:37:01,600","01:37:04,410","- You should've been gone by now.
- Yeah."
939,"01:37:07,800","01:37:09,131",You okay?
940,"01:37:12,520","01:37:13,660",We're supposed to take down
941,"01:37:13,760","01:37:15,444","the Prime Minister
of Great Britain tonight."
942,"01:37:16,880","01:37:17,881",So...
943,"01:37:20,040","01:37:21,087",Brandt?
944,"01:37:24,560","01:37:27,040",I can't see another way.
945,"01:37:29,480","01:37:30,891",Neither can I.
946,"01:37:33,520","01:37:36,205","But we do what we have to do
for our friends, right?"
947,"01:38:21,280","01:38:22,486","Get him ready, please."
948,"01:38:48,200","01:38:50,140","You were right to call me, Brandt.
Where is Hunt?"
949,"01:38:50,240","01:38:52,100","He's on his way.
We don't have much time."
950,"01:38:52,200","01:38:54,940","- What does he intend to do?
- What matters is that he's alive."
951,"01:38:55,040","01:38:58,010","And I need your reassurance
that he's going to stay that way."
952,"01:39:14,240","01:39:15,820",Have you informed the British government
953,"01:39:15,920","01:39:17,780","that Hunt has targeted
the Prime Minister?"
954,"01:39:17,880","01:39:21,327","I will help you capture him alive.
That is the deal."
955,"01:39:28,520","01:39:30,820","You've picked up some terrible habits
from your friend, Brandt,"
956,"01:39:30,920","01:39:34,447","the worst of them being that you still
believe you can control any outcome."
957,"01:39:35,440","01:39:36,930",Stay with him.
958,"01:39:40,920","01:39:43,140",Chief Atlee! Chief Atlee.
959,"01:39:43,240","01:39:45,540","Director Hunley,
how delightful to see you here."
960,"01:39:45,640","01:39:49,460","Last time we spoke, you were hunting
rogue agents in Morocco."
961,"01:39:49,560","01:39:53,531","Chief Atlee, I have reason to believe that
the Prime Minister's life is in danger."
962,"01:39:56,680","01:39:57,920",I'm listening.
963,"01:40:01,360","01:40:04,762","Any advance on 22,000? Anyone?"
964,"01:40:05,160","01:40:07,322",Going once. Going twice.
965,"01:40:07,880","01:40:10,042",Sold to our generous chairwoman.
966,"01:40:10,720","01:40:13,644","Sir? Chief Atlee from MI6
needs to see you."
967,"01:40:13,760","01:40:15,250",He says it's urgent.
968,"01:40:16,880","01:40:18,325",Excuse me.
969,"01:40:28,680","01:40:30,220",What's this all about?
970,"01:40:30,320","01:40:32,561","It's a matter of national security, sir."
971,"01:40:40,000","01:40:42,651","Under no circumstances
is anyone to enter."
972,"01:40:42,920","01:40:44,081","Yes, sir."
973,"01:40:45,800","01:40:47,131",Help me to understand.
974,"01:40:48,160","01:40:50,860",Who is this man? Why is he after me?
975,"01:40:50,960","01:40:53,700","I'm afraid, Prime Minister,
Director Hunley and I"
976,"01:40:53,800","01:40:56,020",share responsibility for this.
977,"01:40:56,120","01:40:59,124","Ethan Hunt was part of
a disgraced intelligence agency"
978,"01:40:59,240","01:41:00,420",which has since been dissolved.
979,"01:41:00,520","01:41:01,820","And he's gone rogue,"
980,"01:41:01,920","01:41:05,527","unfortunately intent on dismantling
an imaginary terror network."
981,"01:41:05,800","01:41:08,140","But new intelligence suggests
he's been manipulated"
982,"01:41:08,240","01:41:10,060",by one of your own former agents.
983,"01:41:10,160","01:41:13,050","Ilsa Faust, Prime Minister.
She disappeared two years ago."
984,"01:41:13,160","01:41:16,926","If you don't mind my asking, what do
I have to do with this phantom network?"
985,"01:41:17,160","01:41:20,060","Sir, this is William Brandt,
a former colleague of Hunt's."
986,"01:41:20,160","01:41:23,300","He came forward with firsthand
knowledge of the plot against you."
987,"01:41:23,400","01:41:26,060","Sir, Hunt is in possession
of a virtual red box"
988,"01:41:26,160","01:41:27,980",that can only be opened by you.
989,"01:41:28,080","01:41:31,527","He believes it is the key
to bring down the Syndicate."
990,"01:41:33,240","01:41:35,083","The Syndicate, you say?"
991,"01:41:35,320","01:41:38,005","Yes, sir. That's what he calls it."
992,"01:41:38,960","01:41:40,007",Atlee?
993,"01:41:40,760","01:41:43,240",He couldn't possibly be talking about
994,"01:41:43,560","01:41:44,686",that Syndicate.
995,"01:41:47,520","01:41:51,320","Because you assured me that
that Syndicate was merely an exercise."
996,"01:41:51,600","01:41:54,740","And it was, Prime Minister,
I can assure you."
997,"01:41:54,840","01:41:55,860",And yet here we have
998,"01:41:55,960","01:41:58,100","the Central Intelligence Agency
indicating otherwise."
999,"01:41:58,200","01:41:59,540",I don't understand.
1000,"01:41:59,640","01:42:01,768","Prime Minister, your life is in danger."
1001,"01:42:02,000","01:42:05,260","I think our first priority is to move you
to a secure location."
1002,"01:42:05,360","01:42:08,250","Sir, does the name Solomon Lane
ring a bell?"
1003,"01:42:10,520","01:42:11,726",Yes.
1004,"01:42:12,560","01:42:15,723","Unfortunately, it does."
1005,"01:42:18,400","01:42:20,880",So there actually is a Syndicate?
1006,"01:42:21,320","01:42:25,325","It was the hypothetical brainchild
of Chief Atlee."
1007,"01:42:25,640","01:42:28,420","Recruit former agents
from other nations,"
1008,"01:42:28,520","01:42:29,860","supply them with a new identity,"
1009,"01:42:29,960","01:42:33,726","and use them to surgically remove
our enemies, both at home and abroad."
1010,"01:42:34,560","01:42:36,801","Its operating budget
was to be hidden offshore"
1011,"01:42:36,920","01:42:39,924","in a virtual red box
which I alone would control."
1012,"01:42:40,480","01:42:43,060","It would have made me
judge, jury, and executioner,"
1013,"01:42:43,160","01:42:44,380",with zero accountability.
1014,"01:42:44,480","01:42:47,140","I rejected the proposal, unequivocally."
1015,"01:42:47,240","01:42:49,900","Furthermore, I was given every assurance"
1016,"01:42:50,000","01:42:51,820",it never passed the planning stage.
1017,"01:42:51,920","01:42:54,491","Prime Minister, there is no Syndicate."
1018,"01:42:54,680","01:42:57,060","These men have been duped
by Agent Faust."
1019,"01:42:57,160","01:43:00,528",Atlee! Save it for the public inquiry.
1020,"01:43:00,840","01:43:02,300","Sir, I urge you not to leave this room."
1021,"01:43:02,400","01:43:03,606","- Excuse me.
- Please."
1022,"01:43:04,160","01:43:06,540","Hunt is uniquely trained
and highly motivated."
1023,"01:43:06,640","01:43:10,008","A specialist without equal,
immune to any countermeasures."
1024,"01:43:10,120","01:43:12,340",There is no secret he cannot extract.
1025,"01:43:12,440","01:43:15,762","No security he cannot breach.
No person he cannot become."
1026,"01:43:16,760","01:43:20,220","He has, most likely,
anticipated this very conversation"
1027,"01:43:20,320","01:43:23,180","and is waiting to strike
in whatever direction we move."
1028,"01:43:23,280","01:43:27,340","Sir, Hunt is the living manifestation
of destiny."
1029,"01:43:27,440","01:43:30,046",And he has made you his mission.
1030,"01:43:31,640","01:43:33,051",Prime Minister?
1031,"01:43:49,080","01:43:50,161",Hunt.
1032,"01:43:51,040","01:43:53,247","Sir, please step away
from the Prime Minister."
1033,"01:43:57,400","01:43:59,620","Just relax, sir.
Everything's going to be all right."
1034,"01:43:59,720","01:44:02,326","- Atlee shot me.
- Yes, he did, sir."
1035,"01:44:05,840","01:44:08,300","Hunt, I hope you realize you've set back"
1036,"01:44:08,400","01:44:11,165","US-UK relations
to the American Revolution?"
1037,"01:44:11,680","01:44:14,411","Desperate times,
desperate measures, sir."
1038,"01:44:17,040","01:44:18,020",I'm here.
1039,"01:44:18,120","01:44:19,804","- Stand by to receive.
- Ready."
1040,"01:44:26,360","01:44:28,840","The Prime Minister's office asked me
to meet him here."
1041,"01:44:29,200","01:44:30,361","This way, sir."
1042,"01:44:30,520","01:44:31,760",Scanning.
1043,"01:44:35,600","01:44:37,648",Retinal scan confirmed.
1044,"01:44:40,440","01:44:42,442","It's okay. Here you go, sir."
1045,"01:44:43,680","01:44:46,160",You've got a very warm hand.
1046,"01:44:55,320","01:44:56,685",Biometric confirmed.
1047,"01:44:57,720","01:45:01,042","The prompt is ""Kipling."""
1048,"01:45:01,880","01:45:05,820","Sir, I'm going to need a pass-phrase.
The prompt is ""Kipling."""
1049,"01:45:05,920","01:45:07,251","Yes, of course."
1050,"01:45:07,560","01:45:10,848","""If you can keep your head when
all about you are losing theirs..."
1051,"01:45:16,240","01:45:19,528","""If you can trust yourself
when all men doubt you..."""
1052,"01:45:24,240","01:45:26,049","- You got it?
- I got it."
1053,"01:45:26,240","01:45:27,820","Oh, man, do I got it."
1054,"01:45:27,920","01:45:29,570",I'm here to see the Prime Minister.
1055,"01:45:29,880","01:45:31,370",We were told not to let anybody in.
1056,"01:45:32,200","01:45:34,771","- By whom?
- By you, sir."
1057,"01:45:38,640","01:45:40,740",Hunley? What is this?
1058,"01:45:40,840","01:45:42,330",Security!
1059,"01:45:49,080","01:45:50,286",Chief Atlee.
1060,"01:45:50,600","01:45:52,523",Kind of you to accept our invitation.
1061,"01:46:02,120","01:46:04,122",Do you know who I am?
1062,"01:46:06,440","01:46:08,460",We know you created the Syndicate.
1063,"01:46:08,560","01:46:10,927","But Lane went rogue
and turned it against you, didn't he?"
1064,"01:46:11,200","01:46:13,601","And you've been
desperately trying to cover it up."
1065,"01:46:13,800","01:46:15,882","That's why you erased the disk
when she brought it to you."
1066,"01:46:16,640","01:46:18,130",That's true.
1067,"01:46:21,080","01:46:25,660","Now, Director Hunley has some
questions for you regarding Ilsa Faust."
1068,"01:46:25,760","01:46:28,380","Namely, how you framed her."
1069,"01:46:28,480","01:46:30,847",That's also true.
1070,"01:46:35,600","01:46:37,045",It's the antidote.
1071,"01:46:37,160","01:46:39,540","When the Prime Minister found out
about the Syndicate,"
1072,"01:46:39,640","01:46:41,260",Atlee attacked him.
1073,"01:46:41,360","01:46:42,540","Yes, that's true."
1074,"01:46:42,640","01:46:45,340","And then you saved
the Prime Minister, sir."
1075,"01:46:45,440","01:46:46,726",Did he?
1076,"01:46:47,320","01:46:48,481",I'm very grateful.
1077,"01:46:59,840","01:47:00,966",Sir.
1078,"01:47:03,800","01:47:06,280","You're cutting it very close, Ethan."
1079,"01:47:07,920","01:47:10,161",I have what you want. Where do I go?
1080,"01:47:27,840","01:47:29,700","Ethan, wait."
1081,"01:47:29,800","01:47:31,900","If I'm not there in 15 minutes,
he'll kill Benji."
1082,"01:47:32,000","01:47:33,860","The mission
is to bring down the Syndicate."
1083,"01:47:33,960","01:47:38,140","If Lane gets his hands on that money,
we're unleashing a terrorist superpower."
1084,"01:47:38,240","01:47:40,686","He'll never take me alive.
I'll make sure of it."
1085,"01:47:41,000","01:47:44,049","And what happens, Ethan,
if you can't make it back?"
1086,"01:47:44,680","01:47:46,523",I'll make it back.
1087,"01:47:47,680","01:47:49,091",Just be ready.
1088,"01:47:54,040","01:47:55,500","Greetings, Prime Minister."
1089,"01:47:55,600","01:47:56,780","If you are viewing this message,"
1090,"01:47:56,880","01:47:59,940","it means that you have chosen
to activate the Syndicate."
1091,"01:48:00,040","01:48:03,700","This disk gives you access
to Â£2.4 billion"
1092,"01:48:03,800","01:48:05,300",in untraceable currency
1093,"01:48:05,400","01:48:09,803","that will allow the Syndicate
to operate undetected for decades."
1094,"01:48:10,200","01:48:14,569","Instructions to access these funds
are as follows."
1095,"01:49:21,320","01:49:23,482","This is the end, Mr. Hunt."
1096,"01:49:32,800","01:49:34,006",Careful.
1097,"01:49:37,240","01:49:38,730",Two pounds of Semtex.
1098,"01:49:39,160","01:49:42,687",Five hundred .30 caliber ball bearings.
1099,"01:49:43,080","01:49:45,060","Your friend is sitting on
a highly sensitive..."
1100,"01:49:45,160","01:49:46,730",...pressure trigger.
1101,"01:49:47,080","01:49:48,844",So no sudden moves.
1102,"01:49:57,240","01:49:58,500",Your final test.
1103,"01:49:58,600","01:50:02,446","When Lane has what he wants,
I kill you and Benji."
1104,"01:50:03,280","01:50:06,602","If not, everyone dies."
1105,"01:50:09,840","01:50:11,365","No time to think, Ethan."
1106,"01:50:11,840","01:50:13,604","Have a seat, please."
1107,"01:50:28,520","01:50:31,808",Human nature. My weapon of choice.
1108,"01:50:32,360","01:50:35,940","From the moment I killed the young lady
in the record shop,"
1109,"01:50:36,040","01:50:38,850","- I knew you would...
- ...stop at nothing to catch me."
1110,"01:50:39,400","01:50:41,562",I also knew Ilsa wouldn't have a choice.
1111,"01:50:42,040","01:50:45,567","Whether she broke you
that night you met or let you go,"
1112,"01:50:46,040","01:50:47,883","whether you let her run in Morocco,"
1113,"01:50:48,680","01:50:51,081",whether she went to Atlee or not...
1114,"01:50:51,360","01:50:55,251","You were certain we'd end up
where we are right now."
1115,"01:50:59,240","01:51:00,924","Then, again,"
1116,"01:51:02,120","01:51:03,201",so was I.
1117,"01:51:04,480","01:51:05,820","I know you, Lane."
1118,"01:51:05,920","01:51:08,780","Somewhere along the line,
you had a crisis of faith."
1119,"01:51:08,880","01:51:12,362","Human life didn't matter anymore.
Or maybe it never really did."
1120,"01:51:12,760","01:51:15,860","Either way,
you killed too many innocent people"
1121,"01:51:15,960","01:51:20,090","without ever asking
who was giving the orders or why."
1122,"01:51:20,440","01:51:24,445","You blame the system for what you are,
instead of yourself."
1123,"01:51:25,240","01:51:28,940","You wanted revenge,
but Rome wasn't destroyed in a day."
1124,"01:51:29,040","01:51:32,283","You needed help.
You needed money, a lot of it."
1125,"01:51:32,920","01:51:35,764",And you'll stop at nothing to get it.
1126,"01:51:36,240","01:51:38,686","That's how I know
I'm going to put you in a box."
1127,"01:51:41,120","01:51:42,246",Where's the disk?
1128,"01:51:43,960","01:51:45,291",Where is the disk?
1129,"01:51:45,760","01:51:47,000",You like to play games.
1130,"01:51:47,480","01:51:48,925",I have a game for you.
1131,"01:51:49,680","01:51:52,843",I'll give you $50 million
1132,"01:51:54,960","01:51:56,769",to let Benji go.
1133,"01:52:13,280","01:52:14,611",Where is the disk?
1134,"01:52:15,720","01:52:17,006",Where is the disk?
1135,"01:52:18,160","01:52:19,605",You're looking at it.
1136,"01:52:19,760","01:52:20,921",I am the disk.
1137,"01:52:21,080","01:52:24,562","I memorized it.
All Â£2.4 billion in numbered accounts."
1138,"01:52:24,800","01:52:26,860","If that vest goes off, you get nothing."
1139,"01:52:26,960","01:52:31,488","Without this money, you're nothing.
Without me, you're nothing."
1140,"01:52:36,160","01:52:38,003","Right now, you're thinking it's a bluff."
1141,"01:52:38,280","01:52:39,900",I'd never let my friends die.
1142,"01:52:40,000","01:52:43,288","I couldn't possibly memorize
the entire disk."
1143,"01:52:43,520","01:52:45,329",There's only one way to be sure.
1144,"01:52:46,800","01:52:48,165",Let Benji go.
1145,"01:53:05,880","01:53:06,927",Take him.
1146,"01:53:11,200","01:53:13,851","They come one step closer, shoot me."
1147,"01:53:15,440","01:53:16,805",Stop!
1148,"01:53:20,040","01:53:22,820","You remember I told you one day
you were going to take things too far?"
1149,"01:53:22,920","01:53:24,524","This is me speaking, by the way,
it's not him."
1150,"01:53:24,880","01:53:29,681","The only way this ends is you and me,
Lane, face to face."
1151,"01:53:30,000","01:53:32,685","Only this time,
I won't be locked in a glass box."
1152,"01:53:32,880","01:53:34,180",You want your money?
1153,"01:53:34,280","01:53:36,931","The Bone Doctor is going to
have to beat it out of me!"
1154,"01:53:37,720","01:53:40,371",Now let Benji go.
1155,"01:53:45,240","01:53:47,083",1 -3-9...
1156,"01:54:08,560","01:54:10,060","- Go.
- Ethan..."
1157,"01:54:10,160","01:54:11,844",Brandt and Luther are waiting. Go.
1158,"01:54:20,480","01:54:21,527",What do I do?
1159,"01:54:21,840","01:54:23,001",Kill the woman.
1160,"01:54:24,960","01:54:26,803",I need Hunt alive.
1161,"01:55:14,480","01:55:16,260","- Go!
- It's Benji. Where am I going?"
1162,"01:55:16,360","01:55:17,860","- They're coming.
- We're not ready."
1163,"01:55:17,960","01:55:19,086",Then get ready.
1164,"01:55:45,720","01:55:47,085",Which way?
1165,"01:58:09,000","01:58:10,923",Now let's see what you're made of.
1166,"02:00:07,160","02:00:10,846","Face to face, just as you wished, Ethan."
1167,"02:00:34,160","02:00:35,810","It hurts, I know."
1168,"02:00:38,000","02:00:40,651","Gentlemen, this is Solomon Lane."
1169,"02:00:41,920","02:00:43,331","Mr. Lane,"
1170,"02:00:45,000","02:00:46,843",meet the IMF.
1171,"02:02:06,280","02:02:07,611",You're free now.
1172,"02:02:10,680","02:02:12,205",Where will you go?
1173,"02:02:13,680","02:02:14,886",I don't know.
1174,"02:02:17,600","02:02:19,250",I've done my part.
1175,"02:02:19,920","02:02:21,046",Yeah.
1176,"02:02:26,600","02:02:27,931","Ethan, we got to go!"
1177,"02:02:37,880","02:02:39,609",You'd better hurry now.
1178,"02:02:41,840","02:02:43,080",Good luck.
1179,"02:02:58,280","02:02:59,964",You know how to find me.
1180,"02:03:17,760","02:03:19,171",Director Hunley?
1181,"02:03:21,280","02:03:23,020",Director Hunley!
1182,"02:03:23,120","02:03:24,340",Mr. Chairman.
1183,"02:03:24,440","02:03:26,220","Six months ago,
you stood before this panel"
1184,"02:03:26,320","02:03:29,100",and demanded that the IMF be dissolved.
1185,"02:03:29,200","02:03:30,860","That is correct, sir."
1186,"02:03:30,960","02:03:32,820",How do you explain your testimony today?
1187,"02:03:32,920","02:03:35,220","It's quite simple, really.
We had reason to believe that"
1188,"02:03:35,320","02:03:38,660","the Syndicate had infiltrated
our government at the highest level."
1189,"02:03:38,760","02:03:41,300","In order for our man
to infiltrate that organization,"
1190,"02:03:41,400","02:03:44,220",his cover had to be absolute.
1191,"02:03:44,320","02:03:48,530","The whole operation was known only
to myself and a handful of IMF agents."
1192,"02:03:48,840","02:03:53,700","So the shuttering of the IMF
was all part of an elaborate scheme"
1193,"02:03:53,800","02:03:55,802",to expose the so-called Syndicate.
1194,"02:03:56,120","02:03:57,180","That is correct, sir."
1195,"02:03:57,280","02:04:02,320","Which is why you're here today
asking for the IMF to be reinstated."
1196,"02:04:02,800","02:04:04,404","That is correct, sir."
1197,"02:04:06,960","02:04:09,930","I'm not sure the Committee approves
of your methods, Director Hunley."
1198,"02:04:10,480","02:04:13,802","Desperate times, desperate measures,
Mr. Chairman."
1199,"02:04:15,680","02:04:19,526","And you, Mr. Brandt,
how can you justify this deception?"
1200,"02:04:22,000","02:04:25,220","I can neither confirm nor deny
details of any operation"
1201,"02:04:25,320","02:04:27,368",without the Secretary's approval.
1202,"02:04:35,360","02:04:37,700","Welcome to the IMF,"
1203,"02:04:37,800","02:04:39,325",Mr. Secretary.
