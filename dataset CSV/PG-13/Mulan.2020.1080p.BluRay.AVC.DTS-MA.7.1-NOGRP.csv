2,"00:00:41,456","00:00:43,041",There have been many tales
3,"00:00:43,125","00:00:44,960","of the great warrior, Mulan."
4,"00:00:47,504","00:00:51,300","But, ancestors,
this one is mine."
5,"00:00:52,676","00:00:54,011",Here she is.
6,"00:00:54,511","00:00:56,638","A young shoot,
all green..."
7,"00:00:57,473","00:00:59,683",unaware of the blade.
8,"00:01:01,435","00:01:03,687",If you had such a daughter...
9,"00:01:03,854","00:01:07,816","her chi, the boundless energy
of life itself..."
10,"00:01:07,983","00:01:10,611","speaking through
her every motion..."
11,"00:01:10,777","00:01:14,823","could you tell her that
only a son could wield chi?"
12,"00:01:16,283","00:01:21,121","That a daughter would risk
shame, dishonor, exile?"
13,"00:01:23,499","00:01:27,127","Ancestors, I could not."
14,"00:01:52,820","00:01:53,821",This way.
15,"00:01:56,073","00:01:57,241",That's the last one.
16,"00:01:57,407","00:01:58,408",Gently.
17,"00:02:01,119","00:02:02,412",Mulan! Forget the chicken!
18,"00:02:03,539","00:02:04,623",It will come back!
19,"00:02:10,379","00:02:11,672",No!
20,"00:02:15,217","00:02:18,303","Tell me your sister
is not the cause of this."
21,"00:02:21,431","00:02:22,599",Mulan!
22,"00:02:22,683","00:02:24,643",Take control of yourself!
23,"00:02:51,170","00:02:53,839","Mulan!
Listen very carefully."
24,"00:02:55,132","00:02:56,300",No!
25,"00:03:29,374","00:03:32,836","Mulan, what happened
when you fell off the roof?"
26,"00:03:33,962","00:03:35,756",It was like you were a bird.
27,"00:03:35,923","00:03:37,424",Don't panic.
28,"00:03:37,508","00:03:39,718","There's a spider
crawling in your hair."
29,"00:03:40,552","00:03:42,137",You know I'm afraid of spiders.
30,"00:03:42,513","00:03:44,890","This is not one of
your tricks, is it, Mulan?"
31,"00:03:44,973","00:03:48,477","Don't worry,
if you hold very still..."
32,"00:03:48,644","00:03:50,771",I will squash it.
33,"00:03:51,104","00:03:53,482","It is because I'm trying
to protect Mulan"
34,"00:03:53,565","00:03:54,566",that I say this.
35,"00:03:54,650","00:03:55,651",Mulan is young.
36,"00:03:55,734","00:03:57,778","She is still learning
how to control herself."
37,"00:03:58,320","00:04:00,489",You make excuses for her.
38,"00:04:01,490","00:04:05,160","You forget, Mulan is
a daughter, not a son."
39,"00:04:05,619","00:04:08,413","A daughter brings honor
through marriage."
40,"00:04:08,497","00:04:11,959","Any man would be fortunate to
marry either of our daughters."
41,"00:04:12,126","00:04:13,252",Including Mulan.
42,"00:04:13,836","00:04:16,296","I ask you, what man will want
to marry a girl"
43,"00:04:16,380","00:04:18,507","who flits around rooftops,
chasing chickens?"
44,"00:04:22,886","00:04:24,972",Xiu gives me no trouble.
45,"00:04:25,722","00:04:28,809","The matchmaker will find
a good husband for her."
46,"00:04:30,227","00:04:32,020",It is Mulan I worry about.
47,"00:04:33,230","00:04:35,357",They'll call her a witch.
48,"00:04:37,734","00:04:39,820",It's time you talked to her.
49,"00:05:06,054","00:05:07,127",Do you know why the phoenix
50,"00:05:07,139","00:05:09,099","sits at the entrance
of our shrine?"
51,"00:05:11,768","00:05:15,147","She is the emissary
for our ancestors."
52,"00:05:15,314","00:05:16,773",But I broke her.
53,"00:05:19,026","00:05:22,571","Some say the phoenix
is consumed by flame..."
54,"00:05:23,071","00:05:24,823",and emerges again.
55,"00:05:25,991","00:05:28,494","I think she can survive
a broken wing."
56,"00:05:30,287","00:05:32,581","Your chi is strong, Mulan."
57,"00:05:34,249","00:05:37,669",But chi is for warriors...
58,"00:05:37,836","00:05:39,922",not daughters.
59,"00:05:41,215","00:05:42,966","Soon, you'll be a young woman..."
60,"00:05:43,926","00:05:46,011",and it is time for you...
61,"00:05:47,679","00:05:49,181",to hide your gift away.
62,"00:05:50,098","00:05:51,225",To...
63,"00:05:52,226","00:05:54,770",To silence its voice.
64,"00:05:57,481","00:05:59,066",I say this to protect you.
65,"00:06:01,151","00:06:02,653",That is my job.
66,"00:06:04,404","00:06:08,283","Your job is to bring honor
to the family."
67,"00:06:09,743","00:06:11,662",Do you think you can do that?
68,"00:07:59,603","00:08:01,897",Rourans? It can't be.
69,"00:08:02,856","00:08:04,942",Close the gates!
70,"00:08:17,246","00:08:18,247",Take out the leader!
71,"00:09:04,084","00:09:05,669",He's way too strong!
72,"00:09:13,635","00:09:15,220",You. You'll do.
73,"00:09:40,996","00:09:42,748",Your Majesty...
74,"00:09:42,915","00:09:45,751","six of our northern garrisons
along the Silk Road..."
75,"00:09:45,918","00:09:48,253","have fallen
in a coordinated attack."
76,"00:09:48,587","00:09:50,798",All trade has been disrupted.
77,"00:09:50,964","00:09:52,674","If we allow this to continue,"
78,"00:09:52,758","00:09:54,802","it could be
the end of the kingdom."
79,"00:09:54,968","00:09:56,386",And my citizens?
80,"00:09:58,096","00:09:59,181",Slaughtered.
81,"00:10:00,432","00:10:03,143","This soldier
is the only survivor."
82,"00:10:03,977","00:10:06,605",I fear more attacks will follow.
83,"00:10:07,356","00:10:08,941",Who is responsible?
84,"00:10:11,902","00:10:14,488","Rourans, Your Majesty."
85,"00:10:14,988","00:10:17,866","Their leader calls himself
Böri Khan."
86,"00:10:17,991","00:10:19,493",I killed Böri Khan.
87,"00:10:19,618","00:10:20,702",It is his son.
88,"00:10:21,119","00:10:22,663",He has united the tribes
89,"00:10:22,746","00:10:24,623",and resurrected the Rouran army.
90,"00:10:24,832","00:10:27,292","If I may,
Your Imperial Majesty."
91,"00:10:31,922","00:10:33,006",You may speak.
92,"00:10:35,843","00:10:38,554","Böri Khan
fights alongside a woman."
93,"00:10:39,179","00:10:40,889",Her chi is beyond imagining.
94,"00:10:41,056","00:10:43,392","There is no place
for witches in this kingdom."
95,"00:10:43,559","00:10:46,270","It is forbidden
to use the power of chi"
96,"00:10:46,353","00:10:47,813",in destructive ways.
97,"00:10:47,896","00:10:49,356","And yet, it is her skill"
98,"00:10:49,439","00:10:51,441","that leads the Rouran army
to victory."
99,"00:10:51,900","00:10:54,403","She has trained an elite force
of shadow warriors"
100,"00:10:54,486","00:10:55,779",to assist Böri Khan.
101,"00:10:55,863","00:10:59,074",We're not afraid of dark magic.
102,"00:10:59,158","00:11:02,578","We'll destroy this Rouran army
and their witch."
103,"00:11:04,746","00:11:06,081",Here's my decree.
104,"00:11:06,832","00:11:09,334",We'll build a mighty army.
105,"00:11:09,501","00:11:12,421","Every family
will supply one man."
106,"00:11:13,589","00:11:16,717","We'll protect
our beloved people..."
107,"00:11:16,884","00:11:19,094",\an8and crush these murderers.
108,"00:11:20,846","00:11:23,599",Deploy the Imperial Army.
109,"00:11:23,974","00:11:27,936","The dynasty
will not be threatened."
110,"00:12:05,724","00:12:08,519","So, you have news."
111,"00:12:09,520","00:12:11,438",The emperor sends his army
112,"00:12:11,522","00:12:12,940",to defend the Silk Road.
113,"00:12:13,023","00:12:14,024",Good.
114,"00:12:14,107","00:12:15,609",We will crush every garrison
115,"00:12:15,692","00:12:18,111","until the Imperial Army
is on its knees."
116,"00:12:18,779","00:12:20,113",And then...
117,"00:12:21,198","00:12:24,159","the Imperial City
will be laid bare."
118,"00:12:25,077","00:12:27,246","The emperor
will be mine to kill."
119,"00:12:28,330","00:12:29,873","You have proved useful, witch."
120,"00:12:30,415","00:12:31,458",Not witch.
121,"00:12:32,543","00:12:34,419",Warrior.
122,"00:12:36,421","00:12:39,591","I could tear you to pieces
before you blink."
123,"00:12:39,758","00:12:41,176",But you won't.
124,"00:12:43,679","00:12:45,806",Remember what you want...
125,"00:12:46,849","00:12:50,018","a place where your powers
will not be vilified."
126,"00:12:50,185","00:12:53,230","A place where you are accepted
for who you are."
127,"00:12:54,398","00:12:56,817","You won't get what you want
without me."
128,"00:13:03,240","00:13:04,616","When I found you
on a desert steppe"
129,"00:13:04,700","00:13:06,201",wandering alone...
130,"00:13:06,368","00:13:07,828",you were exiled.
131,"00:13:08,245","00:13:09,788",A scorned dog.
132,"00:13:10,664","00:13:15,210","When I sit on the throne,
that dog will have a home."
133,"00:13:18,338","00:13:20,674",We will finish what we started.
134,"00:13:22,092","00:13:23,260",And you will see to it
135,"00:13:23,343","00:13:26,597","that nothing and no one
stands in my way."
136,"00:13:55,292","00:13:56,752",Black Wind and I rode alongside
137,"00:13:56,835","00:13:58,587","two rabbits
running side by side."
138,"00:13:58,754","00:14:01,131","I think one was a male,
one was a female."
139,"00:14:01,298","00:14:03,050","But you know,
you can't really tell"
140,"00:14:03,133","00:14:04,676",when they're running that fast.
141,"00:14:05,219","00:14:07,888","When I go riding tomorrow,
I will try to find them again."
142,"00:14:08,055","00:14:09,211",Maybe they'll still be there.
143,"00:14:09,223","00:14:11,141",We have excellent news.
144,"00:14:11,308","00:14:13,894","The matchmaker has found you
an auspicious match."
145,"00:14:16,688","00:14:18,649","Yes, Mulan, it is decided."
146,"00:14:22,903","00:14:24,279",Come and sit down.
147,"00:14:32,246","00:14:34,081","It is what is best
for our family."
148,"00:14:44,383","00:14:45,384",Yes.
149,"00:14:49,221","00:14:50,472",It is best.
150,"00:14:52,266","00:14:54,518",I will bring honor to us all.
151,"00:15:57,331","00:15:58,851","I'm truly blessed
to be in the presence"
152,"00:15:58,916","00:16:00,751",of such enchanting women.
153,"00:16:00,918","00:16:04,254","I have no doubt today will be
a momentous day for the Hua..."
154,"00:16:04,338","00:16:07,132","Never mind that.
We must be on time."
155,"00:16:07,299","00:16:08,675",I'm starving.
156,"00:16:08,842","00:16:10,469","I already told you,
you cannot eat."
157,"00:16:10,552","00:16:11,678",It will ruin your makeup.
158,"00:16:11,762","00:16:14,807","The fiercest winter storm
could not destroy this makeup."
159,"00:16:15,516","00:16:18,644","Xiu, look at my face.
What am I feeling?"
160,"00:16:19,102","00:16:20,437",I have no idea.
161,"00:16:20,604","00:16:21,939",Exactly.
162,"00:16:22,189","00:16:25,692","This is my sad face.
This is my curious face."
163,"00:16:26,276","00:16:27,778",And now I'm confused.
164,"00:16:31,323","00:16:32,574",Quiet.
165,"00:16:34,576","00:16:35,744",Composed.
166,"00:16:37,371","00:16:38,622",Graceful.
167,"00:16:40,207","00:16:41,542",Elegant.
168,"00:16:43,836","00:16:44,837",Poised.
169,"00:16:46,130","00:16:47,214",Polite.
170,"00:16:49,216","00:16:52,010",These are the qualities...
171,"00:16:52,177","00:16:55,055",we see in a good wife.
172,"00:16:56,056","00:16:58,892",These are the qualities...
173,"00:16:59,977","00:17:02,771",we see in Mulan.
174,"00:17:03,814","00:17:07,609","When a wife
serves her husband..."
175,"00:17:09,778","00:17:12,614",...she must be silent.
176,"00:17:15,576","00:17:17,035",She must be...
177,"00:17:17,703","00:17:18,954",invisible.
178,"00:17:20,998","00:17:22,332",She must be...
179,"00:17:23,750","00:17:25,169",Is something wrong?
180,"00:17:26,128","00:17:29,089","No, Madam Matchmaker.
Thank you."
181,"00:17:31,508","00:17:34,261",It's ideal for the teapot...
182,"00:17:36,430","00:17:40,309","to remain
in the center of the table."
183,"00:17:40,642","00:17:42,269","Yes, I understand."
184,"00:17:44,062","00:17:47,441","But I think the teapot
should remain where it is."
185,"00:17:48,025","00:17:49,651",Move the teapot.
186,"00:17:49,860","00:17:50,861",Girl!
187,"00:18:40,994","00:18:43,455",Dishonor to the Hua family.
188,"00:18:44,164","00:18:48,085","They have failed
to raise a good daughter."
189,"00:19:16,905","00:19:18,282",Citizens!
190,"00:19:20,200","00:19:24,454","Citizens, we are under attack
from Northern Invaders."
191,"00:19:25,831","00:19:28,167",Our land is at war.
192,"00:19:28,625","00:19:31,128","By edict
of His Imperial Majesty,"
193,"00:19:31,211","00:19:32,754",the Son of Heaven...
194,"00:19:33,380","00:19:37,551","every family must contribute
one man to fight."
195,"00:19:38,760","00:19:41,013",One man from every house.
196,"00:19:42,973","00:19:44,349",Wáng family.
197,"00:19:48,187","00:19:49,313",Chin family.
198,"00:19:51,356","00:19:52,858",Dù family.
199,"00:19:54,485","00:19:56,028",Hua family.

against the Northern Invaders."
203,"00:20:11,960","00:20:14,046","Have you no son
old enough to fight?"

207,"00:20:28,268","00:20:29,978","You will
only humiliate him further."
208,"00:20:30,062","00:20:31,647","Are you all right?
Can I help you?"
209,"00:20:31,730","00:20:32,731",No.

339,"00:37:13,774","00:37:16,318","I like kissing women
with cherry red lips."
340,"00:37:16,443","00:37:17,516","I don't care
what she looks like."
341,"00:37:17,528","00:37:19,780","- I agree.
- I care what she cooks like."
342,"00:37:22,324","00:37:23,700","Tell us, Hua Jun."

350,"00:37:45,973","00:37:48,183","Courageous, funny, smart."
351,"00:37:48,350","00:37:49,810","Hua Jun's not describing
a woman..."
352,"00:37:51,019","00:37:52,813",...he's describing me.
353,"00:37:52,896","00:37:55,482","That's not you, Yao.

363,"00:38:29,224","00:38:30,434",Didn't work out.
364,"00:38:31,894","00:38:33,270",Lucky you.
365,"00:38:34,271","00:38:36,190","I mean, how do you
even begin to know"
366,"00:38:36,273","00:38:37,441",how to talk to a woman...
367,"00:38:37,608","00:38:39,568",let alone be married to one?
368,"00:38:42,196","00:38:45,908","Just talk to her like
you are talking to me now."
369,"00:38:46,158","00:38:49,119","Yeah, I wish it was that easy."
370,"00:38:54,082","00:38:55,459",What if she doesn't like me?
371,"00:38:57,544","00:38:58,545",She will.
372,"00:39:02,299","00:39:03,967","I mean,
I think she will, you know?"
373,"00:39:04,051","00:39:05,719",You never know with women.
374,"00:39:13,727","00:39:15,527","You should really consider
skipping guard duty"
375,"00:39:15,562","00:39:16,814",and taking a shower.
376,"00:39:17,564","00:39:19,191","You stink, my friend."

on the wrong foot."
401,"00:43:11,673","00:43:13,300",Can we be friends?
402,"00:43:13,467","00:43:15,177",I'm not your friend.
403,"00:43:18,472","00:43:19,681",Very well.
404,"00:43:20,599","00:43:21,683",But you are my equal.
405,"00:43:22,351","00:43:25,729","We fight together
against the same enemy."
406,"00:43:25,896","00:43:28,106","I will do all I can
to protect the others."
407,"00:43:31,527","00:43:33,445",You can turn your back on me...
408,"00:43:34,029","00:43:37,366","but when the time comes,
do not turn your back on them."
409,"00:43:55,634","00:43:57,052",I welcome the leaders
410,"00:43:57,136","00:43:59,263",of the 12 Rouran tribes...
411,"00:43:59,429","00:44:01,473","as we approach
the final victory."
412,"00:44:01,682","00:44:04,017","Soon the Imperial City
will be ours."
413,"00:44:04,643","00:44:06,019",But we're relying on a witch.
414,"00:44:06,311","00:44:07,871","Yes, a witch."
415,"00:44:07,896","00:44:09,176",A witch cannot be trusted!
416,"00:44:09,189","00:44:11,429",She is no threat.
417,"00:44:11,692","00:44:13,360",Hush! Enough!
418,"00:44:14,486","00:44:15,988",Make no mistake...
419,"00:44:16,572","00:44:19,700","the witch serves me
and therefore, all of us."
420,"00:44:20,784","00:44:22,244",She knows who her master is.
421,"00:44:27,875","00:44:29,751",Consider our future.
422,"00:44:30,210","00:44:31,670","This, my friends..."
423,"00:44:31,837","00:44:34,756","is just a small taste
of what is to come."
424,"00:44:34,923","00:44:36,550","From the Imperial City ahead,"
425,"00:44:36,717","00:44:39,178","riches will flow
like a mighty river."
426,"00:44:39,344","00:44:42,014",I don't care about riches.
427,"00:44:48,645","00:44:51,356",How much gold can a nomad carry?
428,"00:44:56,653","00:44:59,156","Then, I will give you revenge..."
429,"00:45:00,324","00:45:02,868","for the land we lost
to the empire."
430,"00:45:03,619","00:45:05,454",For the shame of the last war.
431,"00:45:05,621","00:45:07,498","For my father,
who the emperor killed."
432,"00:45:09,875","00:45:11,376",If gold is not enough...
433,"00:45:12,711","00:45:14,713",I will give you blood.
434,"00:45:16,465","00:45:17,925",Sharpen your swords.
435,"00:45:18,091","00:45:19,510",Our time has come.
436,"00:45:22,346","00:45:24,848","Now I know.
I serve you."
437,"00:45:25,516","00:45:27,309",I am the slave.
438,"00:45:27,476","00:45:30,020","And you would
do well to remember it."
439,"00:45:30,854","00:45:34,191","Over there, witch.
The next garrison."
440,"00:45:35,984","00:45:36,985",Destroy it.
441,"00:45:48,455","00:45:49,456",Hua Jun.
442,"00:45:50,165","00:45:51,667",Report to Commander Tung.
443,"00:46:10,769","00:46:12,146","Hua Jun, Commander."
444,"00:46:12,813","00:46:13,939",Enter.
445,"00:46:22,865","00:46:23,991",Hua Jun.
446,"00:46:31,206","00:46:32,916","It seems you have been
hiding something."
447,"00:46:35,878","00:46:37,463","- Commander...
- I sensed it"
448,"00:46:37,546","00:46:39,089",the moment I met you.
449,"00:46:40,048","00:46:41,467",But now I'm sure.
450,"00:46:44,178","00:46:46,096","You see,
I have a secret as well."
451,"00:46:47,431","00:46:48,724",I know your father.
452,"00:46:49,600","00:46:51,727",He was a great soldier.
453,"00:46:51,894","00:46:53,061","In you, Hua Jun..."
454,"00:46:53,562","00:46:55,230",I see the shadow of his sword.
455,"00:46:55,939","00:46:58,650","Perhaps this shadow
falls heavy on your shoulders."
456,"00:46:59,401","00:47:01,695","You can't allow your father's
legacy to hold you back."
457,"00:47:02,321","00:47:04,448",You need to cultivate your gift.
458,"00:47:05,115","00:47:06,116",Sir.
459,"00:47:06,283","00:47:08,368","Your chi is powerful, Hua Jun."
460,"00:47:08,911","00:47:10,037",Why do you hide it?
461,"00:47:17,753","00:47:19,963",I... I don't know.
462,"00:47:33,894","00:47:35,550",The chi pervades the universe
463,"00:47:35,562","00:47:37,105",and all living things.
464,"00:47:38,023","00:47:40,192",We are all born with it.
465,"00:47:43,195","00:47:47,115","But only the most true will
connect deeply to his chi..."
466,"00:47:47,282","00:47:49,117",and become a great warrior.
467,"00:47:51,745","00:47:53,664",Tranquil as a forest...
468,"00:47:53,872","00:47:55,707",but on fire within.
469,"00:48:03,423","00:48:05,134",The Rouran enemy is vast.
470,"00:48:06,009","00:48:08,387","They are ruthless
and unpredictable."
471,"00:48:10,222","00:48:12,057",Yet physical force
472,"00:48:12,599","00:48:14,309","need not be met
with equal force."
473,"00:48:15,102","00:48:18,397","The warrior yields to force
and redirects it."
474,"00:48:20,107","00:48:22,943","Disadvantage can be turned
into an advantage."
475,"00:48:23,694","00:48:27,281","Four ounces
can move 1,000 pounds."
476,"00:51:34,885","00:51:36,685",The garrisons continue to fall
477,"00:51:36,720","00:51:38,222",to the Northern Invaders.
478,"00:51:38,388","00:51:40,224","We have been called to war,"
479,"00:51:40,307","00:51:42,267","even though our training
is not finished."
480,"00:51:42,768","00:51:43,882",We leave to defend
481,"00:51:43,894","00:51:45,008",the Mountain-Steppe Garrison
482,"00:51:45,020","00:51:46,480",against the Rouran invader.
483,"00:51:47,064","00:51:50,400","Up until now, you've been
boys playing soldiers."
484,"00:51:50,901","00:51:53,278","Today, you become men."
485,"00:51:55,113","00:51:57,115","You will now take the oath
of the warrior..."
486,"00:51:57,282","00:52:00,118","pledging fidelity to
the three pillars of virtue."
487,"00:52:01,036","00:52:02,663","The enemy possesses
none of these..."
488,"00:52:02,830","00:52:05,290",and therefore can be defeated.
489,"00:52:05,457","00:52:08,669","Remember this when you
meet him on the battlefield."
490,"00:52:09,336","00:52:10,462",Draw sword!
491,"00:52:13,340","00:52:15,425","- Loyal.
- Loyal!"
492,"00:52:15,592","00:52:17,094","- Brave.
- Brave!"
493,"00:52:17,845","00:52:19,805","- True.
- True!"
494,"00:52:24,184","00:52:25,811",Return swords!
495,"00:52:28,605","00:52:29,606",In!
496,"00:52:53,630","00:52:55,424","Commander Tung, it's Hua Jun."
497,"00:52:55,507","00:52:56,707",You may enter.
498,"00:53:04,892","00:53:06,393","Commander Tung,"
499,"00:53:06,477","00:53:08,437","there's something that weighs
heavily on my heart."
500,"00:53:08,562","00:53:10,147",I need to confess it to you.
501,"00:53:13,358","00:53:15,068","It has to do
with the three virtues."
502,"00:53:15,235","00:53:17,905","There's no shame in being
fearful before battle."
503,"00:53:19,490","00:53:22,493","In fact, it's a testament
to your honesty..."
504,"00:53:22,659","00:53:24,661",that you confess such doubt.
505,"00:53:25,496","00:53:27,748","Yes, Commander.
But the other virtues..."
506,"00:53:27,831","00:53:29,249",Hua Jun.
507,"00:53:31,585","00:53:32,586",You're a good man.
508,"00:53:34,546","00:53:36,340","Perhaps one day
you could accompany me"
509,"00:53:36,423","00:53:37,925",to my village...
510,"00:53:38,091","00:53:39,731","where I will introduce you
to my daughter."
511,"00:53:41,929","00:53:43,514","And our village matchmaker,
of course."
512,"00:53:48,143","00:53:50,729","Yes, Commander.
That's my great honor."
513,"00:53:51,396","00:53:53,273","I look forward
to seeing your father's face"
514,"00:53:53,941","00:53:55,526",when you give him this news.
515,"00:54:26,849","00:54:28,517",The Fourth Battalion.
516,"00:54:33,522","00:54:35,732",This is the work of Böri Khan.
517,"00:54:38,068","00:54:39,570",There's no one left.
518,"00:55:11,768","00:55:13,645","The Mountain-Steppe
Garrison welcomes..."
519,"00:55:13,729","00:55:16,690","the Fifth Battalion of
His Majesty's Imperial Army."
520,"00:55:21,445","00:55:22,571",Scouts at the gate!
521,"00:55:31,788","00:55:34,625","Böri Khan assembles not
a half day's ride from here."
522,"00:55:34,791","00:55:35,876",They prepare for battle.
523,"00:55:36,043","00:55:37,127",We're greatly outnumbered.
524,"00:55:37,211","00:55:38,533",Fortify for a siege!
525,"00:55:38,545","00:55:41,340","No. He who moves first
controls the enemy."
526,"00:55:44,009","00:55:45,302",We leave at first light.
527,"00:55:49,765","00:55:51,365","Anything you want me
to tell your mothers"
528,"00:55:51,391","00:55:52,601",when you die?
529,"00:55:53,101","00:55:55,479",That's not funny.
530,"00:55:56,146","00:55:58,440",What's the matter? Scared?
531,"00:55:59,441","00:56:00,526",No.
532,"00:56:01,401","00:56:03,487","Who knows who will live
past tomorrow?"
533,"00:56:04,780","00:56:06,824","We may never see
each other again."
534,"00:56:09,868","00:56:11,787",My father once said...
535,"00:56:12,746","00:56:14,665","""There is no courage
without fear."""
536,"00:56:14,832","00:56:15,833",So?
537,"00:56:16,875","00:56:18,001",So this is natural.
538,"00:56:18,085","00:56:19,628","Well, it doesn't feel natural."
539,"00:56:32,099","00:56:34,768","Listen to me, all of you."
540,"00:56:36,895","00:56:38,147",We will live.
541,"00:56:40,983","00:56:42,484",I guarantee it.
542,"00:56:44,570","00:56:46,029",Because I will protect you.
543,"00:56:46,989","00:56:48,574",We'll protect each other.
544,"00:56:49,199","00:56:50,659",We'll fight for each other.
545,"00:57:01,170","00:57:02,296","Except for you, Yao."
546,"00:57:02,838","00:57:05,757","I might take the opportunity
to kill you myself."
547,"00:58:29,258","00:58:30,664",They've left the garrison.
548,"00:58:30,676","00:58:32,761","A bold move
that changes nothing."
549,"00:58:32,928","00:58:34,054",The plan continues.
550,"00:58:34,930","00:58:36,390",Charge!
551,"00:58:44,189","00:58:45,899","Spear men, open!"
552,"00:58:54,283","00:58:55,951","Archers, ready!"
553,"00:58:58,370","00:58:59,580",Raise!
554,"00:59:30,402","00:59:31,653",Release!
555,"00:59:45,292","00:59:47,461","The coward retreats!
Pursue them!"
556,"00:59:47,544","00:59:49,338",Left flank! Charge!
557,"01:01:58,842","01:02:00,010",You're a witch.
558,"01:02:00,093","01:02:01,178",Am I?
559,"01:02:01,261","01:02:03,263",And who are you?
560,"01:02:06,099","01:02:07,601",I'm Hua Jun.
561,"01:02:07,768","01:02:10,312","Soldier in the emperor's
Imperial Army."
562,"01:02:17,694","01:02:18,737",Liar.
563,"01:02:22,449","01:02:23,909",Your deceit weakens you.
564,"01:02:25,828","01:02:27,955",It poisons your chi.
565,"01:03:08,829","01:03:10,164",I ask again...
566,"01:03:11,248","01:03:12,749",who are you?
567,"01:03:13,292","01:03:14,543",I'm Hua Jun.
568,"01:03:14,710","01:03:16,753","Soldier in the emperor's
Imperial Army!"
569,"01:03:17,254","01:03:18,547",Then you will die
570,"01:03:18,630","01:03:20,466","pretending to be
something you're not."
571,"01:03:47,284","01:03:49,203",And Hua Jun did die.
572,"01:03:53,248","01:03:55,876",For a lie can only live so long.
573,"01:03:59,838","01:04:01,423",But Mulan...

603,"01:12:46,156","01:12:47,783",He's a girl?
604,"01:12:49,701","01:12:52,079",You are an imposter.
605,"01:12:52,830","01:12:54,331",You've betrayed the regiment.
606,"01:12:55,207","01:12:58,252","You've brought disgrace
to the Hua family."
607,"01:12:59,044","01:13:01,255","- Commander...
- Your deceit is my shame."
608,"01:13:02,756","01:13:04,091","Commander,"
609,"01:13:04,174","01:13:06,094","what is the punishment
assigned to this imposter?"
610,"01:13:08,053","01:13:09,138",Expulsion.
611,"01:13:13,350","01:13:15,644",I would rather be executed.
612,"01:13:17,271","01:13:19,106","From this moment forward,"
613,"01:13:19,189","01:13:22,484","you are expelled from
the emperor's Imperial Army."
614,"01:13:28,031","01:13:30,242",If you show your face again...
615,"01:13:30,409","01:13:34,454","your wish to be executed
will be granted."
616,"01:14:17,706","01:14:19,583",You can never go home.
617,"01:14:20,125","01:14:23,212","Your disgrace
is worse than death."
618,"01:14:37,226","01:14:39,102",I understand.
619,"01:14:42,189","01:14:47,027","I was a girl like you
when people turned on me."
620,"01:14:51,949","01:14:54,993","You don't think
I longed for a noble path?"
621,"01:14:58,288","01:15:00,874",I've lived a life of exile.
622,"01:15:01,667","01:15:06,588","No country,
no village, no family."
623,"01:15:10,509","01:15:12,261",We are the same.
624,"01:15:13,846","01:15:15,597","- We're not.
- We are."
625,"01:15:16,557","01:15:19,935","The more power I showed,
the more I was crushed."
626,"01:15:20,102","01:15:22,479",Just like you.
627,"01:15:23,564","01:15:27,151","You saved them today
and still they turned on you."
628,"01:15:28,110","01:15:30,529","You are just at the beginning
of your power."
629,"01:15:32,614","01:15:33,991",Merge your path with mine.
630,"01:15:35,325","01:15:37,202",We will be stronger together.
631,"01:15:40,372","01:15:44,126","You follow a coward.
A leader who runs from battle."
632,"01:15:44,293","01:15:47,463","Böri Khan
did not run from battle."
633,"01:15:48,380","01:15:51,550","That coward
will take the Imperial City..."
634,"01:15:51,717","01:15:53,844",and your emperor will fall.
635,"01:15:56,472","01:15:57,514",That can't happen.
636,"01:15:57,681","01:16:00,267",But it happens even now.
637,"01:16:05,397","01:16:06,732",Join me.
638,"01:16:08,442","01:16:10,944",We will take our place together.
639,"01:16:19,369","01:16:20,913",I know my place.
640,"01:16:22,539","01:16:24,374",And it is my duty...
641,"01:16:25,000","01:16:28,879","to fight for the kingdom
and protect the emperor."
642,"01:16:55,656","01:16:57,199",Commander Tung!
643,"01:16:59,701","01:17:00,869",What is the meaning of this?
644,"01:17:01,036","01:17:02,913","Commander Tung,
we must ride to the emperor."
645,"01:17:02,996","01:17:04,414",His life is in danger.
646,"01:17:04,498","01:17:06,500","The emperor's life
has never been safer."
647,"01:17:06,667","01:17:08,347","That's what Böri Khan
wants you to believe."
648,"01:17:11,922","01:17:13,715","Please,
you have to listen to me."
649,"01:17:13,882","01:17:16,510","Sergeant, hand me my sword."
650,"01:17:22,015","01:17:24,393","Kill me if you must.
But first, listen."
651,"01:17:25,727","01:17:28,105","The garrison attacks
were just a distraction."
652,"01:17:29,356","01:17:31,608","Khan has our army focused
on the Silk Road..."
653,"01:17:31,775","01:17:33,255","so he can sneak
into the Imperial City"
654,"01:17:33,318","01:17:34,820",and kill the emperor.
655,"01:17:36,071","01:17:37,948",Böri Khan is already far ahead.
656,"01:17:38,031","01:17:40,075","The Imperial Army
can't stop him now."
657,"01:17:41,076","01:17:44,663","But perhaps a small,
well-trained force could."
658,"01:17:46,540","01:17:48,375",When employed correctly...
659,"01:17:50,794","01:17:53,046","four ounces
can move 1,000 pounds."
660,"01:17:56,133","01:18:00,012","Only a foolish man listens to
someone whose very existence"
661,"01:18:00,095","01:18:01,513",is a lie.
662,"01:18:08,645","01:18:10,272",You would believe Hua Jun.
663,"01:18:10,439","01:18:11,940","Why do you not believe
Hua Mulan?"
664,"01:18:12,983","01:18:16,069","She risked everything by
revealing her true identity."
665,"01:18:17,696","01:18:19,865",She's braver than any man here.
666,"01:18:22,075","01:18:24,453","And she's the best warrior
amongst us."
667,"01:18:28,081","01:18:29,841","- I believe Hua Mulan.
- I believe Hua Mulan."
668,"01:18:30,000","01:18:32,377","- I believe Hua Mulan.
- I believe Hua Mulan."
669,"01:18:32,461","01:18:33,617",I believe Hua Mulan.
670,"01:18:33,629","01:18:34,869",I believe Hua Mulan.
671,"01:18:44,515","01:18:45,599",Hua Mulan...
672,"01:18:46,475","01:18:48,852","your actions have brought
disgrace and dishonor"
673,"01:18:48,936","01:18:50,312",to this regiment...
674,"01:18:50,479","01:18:53,690","to this kingdom
and to your own family."
675,"01:18:55,651","01:18:58,195","But your loyalty and bravery
are without question."
676,"01:19:01,657","01:19:04,117","You will lead us as we ride
to the Imperial City."
677,"01:19:07,996","01:19:09,164",Ready the horses.
678,"01:20:27,159","01:20:30,287","Your Majesty, a word.
In private."
679,"01:20:32,873","01:20:36,001","Despite the Rouran army's
crushing defeat..."
680,"01:20:36,168","01:20:37,461",scouts have informed me
681,"01:20:37,544","01:20:39,463","that Böri Khan
has infiltrated the city."
682,"01:20:39,546","01:20:42,466",He assembles at the New Palace.
683,"01:20:42,633","01:20:44,968",He offers a duel.
684,"01:20:45,135","01:20:46,720",Prepare my guards.
685,"01:20:46,887","01:20:49,598",We ride to the site immediately.
686,"01:20:50,432","01:20:52,684","Your Majesty,
it is far too dangerous."
687,"01:20:52,768","01:20:53,894",Silence!
688,"01:20:53,977","01:20:56,146",My people have suffered enough.
689,"01:20:56,313","01:20:58,357",Now I must act.
690,"01:20:58,524","01:21:03,529","I will kill this Böri Khan
like I killed his father."
691,"01:21:03,737","01:21:05,405",With my own hands.
692,"01:21:21,338","01:21:23,423",Assemble all Imperial guardsmen
693,"01:21:23,507","01:21:25,259",immediately in this square.
694,"01:21:25,425","01:21:29,930","That includes every guard
on every tower and every gate."
695,"01:21:30,097","01:21:31,932",But who will protect the city?
696,"01:21:33,308","01:21:35,978","You question the judgement
of His Majesty the Emperor?"
697,"01:21:37,312","01:21:40,482","Of course not, Chancellor.
I will see to it immediately."
698,"01:22:04,506","01:22:05,507",It's time.
699,"01:22:19,730","01:22:21,273",The gates are open!
700,"01:22:21,440","01:22:24,443","The streets are empty!
Why are there no guards?"
701,"01:22:46,965","01:22:47,966",Ambush!
702,"01:22:48,717","01:22:49,718",Protect the emperor!
703,"01:22:49,802","01:22:50,969",Clear her path!
704,"01:22:51,970","01:22:54,223","Don't leave her side!
She must get through."
705,"01:23:45,858","01:23:48,235","Surely you didn't
expect a fair fight?"
706,"01:23:49,319","01:23:51,780","How did you convince
my chancellor to betray me?"
707,"01:23:51,947","01:23:53,699",That was not your chancellor.
708,"01:23:54,074","01:23:55,075",Now!
709,"01:24:06,128","01:24:08,714","Join the others.
Take the city."
710,"01:24:08,881","01:24:11,341","Kill every
last Imperial soldier."
711,"01:24:22,561","01:24:23,721",You need to find the emperor.
712,"01:24:23,854","01:24:25,481",We'll hold them back.
713,"01:24:26,315","01:24:27,900","Till next we meet, Honghui."
714,"01:25:00,140","01:25:01,975",Go! Go!
715,"01:25:03,227","01:25:04,228",Bolt the door.
716,"01:25:06,146","01:25:07,231",Bolt the door.
717,"01:25:30,546","01:25:33,966","Your Majesty, I'm Hua Mulan
from the Fifth Battalion."
718,"01:25:34,133","01:25:35,259",I've come to protect you.
719,"01:25:36,760","01:25:37,761",Impossible.
720,"01:25:44,226","01:25:47,521",A woman leading a man's army.
721,"01:25:48,772","01:25:49,940",Where's the emperor?
722,"01:25:57,656","01:25:59,116",You were right.
723,"01:26:00,534","01:26:01,785",We are the same.
724,"01:26:01,952","01:26:03,495",With one difference.
725,"01:26:04,997","01:26:09,042","They accept you,
but they will never accept me."
726,"01:26:09,209","01:26:11,462","You told me
my journey was impossible."
727,"01:26:14,631","01:26:16,341",Yet here I stand.
728,"01:26:16,925","01:26:19,094","Proof that there is a place
for people like us."
729,"01:26:19,845","01:26:21,054",No.
730,"01:26:25,267","01:26:26,977",It's too late for me.
731,"01:26:31,732","01:26:33,984","You can still take
the noble path."
732,"01:26:41,074","01:26:42,701",It's not too late.
733,"01:26:43,327","01:26:44,578",Please.
734,"01:26:46,955","01:26:48,624",I need your help.
735,"01:26:50,000","01:26:51,210",Where's the emperor?
736,"01:27:48,559","01:27:50,394","They tell me
this palace is being built"
737,"01:27:50,477","01:27:52,187",in honor of your father.
738,"01:27:53,564","01:27:55,816",And in honor of my father...
739,"01:27:56,775","01:27:59,862",this is where you will die.
740,"01:28:02,447","01:28:05,200","Or should I say ""burn""?"
741,"01:28:07,494","01:28:09,997","Who will come to save you,
Son of Heaven?"
742,"01:28:10,539","01:28:12,249","Where are the sons
of the empire?"
743,"01:28:13,250","01:28:14,501",I will tell you.
744,"01:28:15,377","01:28:19,006","Fallen to our swords.
Pierced by our arrows."
745,"01:28:21,216","01:28:23,510",Who will save you?
746,"01:28:35,939","01:28:36,982",Why are you here?
747,"01:28:37,149","01:28:40,402","The attack has met
a fierce resistance."
748,"01:28:40,569","01:28:42,196","- From who?
- A young woman..."
749,"01:28:42,362","01:28:44,156",from a small village.
750,"01:28:44,406","01:28:46,033",A girl?
751,"01:28:46,200","01:28:48,035",A woman.
752,"01:28:48,118","01:28:49,161",A warrior.
753,"01:28:52,581","01:28:54,750",A woman leads the army.
754,"01:28:55,584","01:28:58,754",And she's no scorned dog.
755,"01:29:00,839","01:29:03,175",You led her here.
756,"01:29:28,033","01:29:30,118",Take your place...
757,"01:29:31,745","01:29:32,746",Mulan.
758,"01:30:54,036","01:30:58,040","The girl who has come
to save the dynasty."
759,"01:31:28,195","01:31:29,238",No!
760,"01:31:46,046","01:31:47,381",Rise up.
761,"01:31:49,466","01:31:51,468",You are a mighty warrior.
762,"01:31:51,802","01:31:53,929",Rise up like a phoenix.
763,"01:31:55,264","01:31:57,266","Fight for the kingdom
and its people."
764,"01:34:41,221","01:34:42,306","Stand up, soldier."
765,"01:34:53,692","01:34:54,902",Tell me your name.
766,"01:35:26,183","01:35:29,311","Your Imperial Highness,
Hua Mulan."
767,"01:35:43,116","01:35:47,037","Hua Mulan, the people owe you
a debt of thanks."
768,"01:35:47,996","01:35:49,998",I owe you my life.
769,"01:35:51,291","01:35:54,461","In gratitude for your service
and dedication..."
770,"01:35:54,628","01:35:56,922","I invite you
to take your place..."
771,"01:35:57,005","01:36:00,300","with our greatest
decorated warriors..."
772,"01:36:01,135","01:36:04,638","as an officer
in the Emperor's Guard."
773,"01:36:06,640","01:36:08,267",Your Majesty...
774,"01:36:09,560","01:36:12,688","I'm deeply honored by this
immeasurable invitation..."
775,"01:36:13,772","01:36:15,774",but with humble apologies...
776,"01:36:17,651","01:36:19,403",I cannot accept it.
777,"01:36:25,534","01:36:29,997","I left home
under cover of darkness..."
778,"01:36:30,622","01:36:33,125",and betrayed my family's trust.
779,"01:36:35,294","01:36:38,505","I made choices I knew
would risk their dishonor."
780,"01:36:40,007","01:36:41,049",Since then...
781,"01:36:42,676","01:36:44,052",I have pledged an oath...
782,"01:36:44,595","01:36:49,224","to be loyal, brave, and true."
783,"01:36:53,020","01:36:55,355",In order to fulfill this oath...
784,"01:36:56,356","01:37:01,862","I must return home
and make amends to my family."
785,"01:37:03,614","01:37:06,074","Very well, Hua Mulan."
786,"01:37:10,287","01:37:14,541","Devotion to family
is an essential virtue."
787,"01:37:29,890","01:37:30,891",You can't leave.
788,"01:37:38,941","01:37:40,776","The emperor
gives his permission..."
789,"01:37:40,943","01:37:42,236",but you do not?
790,"01:37:44,822","01:37:46,031",We've not yet said goodbye.
791,"01:37:51,745","01:37:54,832","Goodbye, Honghui."
792,"01:38:03,590","01:38:05,300",You still won't take my hand?
793,"01:38:23,527","01:38:25,362","I will see you again,
Hua Mulan."
794,"01:38:56,560","01:38:57,561",Mulan has returned!
795,"01:38:57,644","01:38:59,188",Mulan!
796,"01:39:01,482","01:39:02,608",Mulan?

I have to ask you."
800,"01:39:51,114","01:39:52,366",Tell me about you first.
801,"01:39:52,491","01:39:54,117",I... I am matched!

803,"01:39:55,410","01:39:56,954","He's handsome, a little shy,"
804,"01:39:57,037","01:39:58,109",but he's not afraid of spiders.

means to you."
