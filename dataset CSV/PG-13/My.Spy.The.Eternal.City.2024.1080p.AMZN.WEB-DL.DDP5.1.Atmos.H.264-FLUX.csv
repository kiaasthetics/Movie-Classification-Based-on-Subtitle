the People's Choice Awards last night,"

of this guy's face."
3,"00:00:44,708","00:00:47,291","Here's the number one single
in the country right now,"

10,"00:01:06,916","00:01:08,517",What are you working on?
11,"00:01:08,541","00:01:11,041","Oh, I'm, um... I'm writing
a new song for my grandma."
12,"00:01:11,125","00:01:12,958","I told her, if I won
a People's Choice Award,"
13,"00:01:13,041","00:01:14,750",I would write her a new song.
14,"00:01:14,833","00:01:16,833",I guess I got a lot of work to do.
15,"00:01:16,916","00:01:18,375",That's really sweet.
16,"00:01:18,458","00:01:21,375","Yeah, well, she worries about me
after those recent threats."
17,"00:01:21,458","00:01:24,538","I told her, as long as I got JJ as my
bodyguard, nothing's gonna happen to me."
18,"00:01:24,583","00:01:26,916",Just glad the CIA gave you some time off.
19,"00:01:27,000","00:01:28,208",That's right.
20,"00:01:28,291","00:01:30,208",I'm gonna take a leak. You want anything?
21,"00:01:30,291","00:01:32,208","Uh, maybe a water on your way back."
22,"00:01:32,291","00:01:34,041","Oh, anything for the man who protects me."
23,"00:01:34,125","00:01:36,458","Anything? I'd like you to teach me
how to play guitar."
24,"00:01:36,541","00:01:39,341","What, with those ham hands?
Just think about playing the tuba."
25,"00:01:39,416","00:01:41,666",Really think I can play the tuba?
26,"00:01:42,916","00:01:44,958","You crack me up, JJ."
27,"00:01:48,416","00:01:50,916",What a cute little dick.
28,"00:01:51,000","00:01:52,500",Water?
29,"00:01:52,583","00:01:55,041","- I couldn't help but overhear.
- Thank you."
30,"00:02:27,666","00:02:29,750",Aah! Son of a...
31,"00:02:36,291","00:02:38,208",Aah! Are you kidding me?
32,"00:02:57,125","00:02:58,916","JJ, it's Sophie."
33,"00:02:59,000","00:03:01,125",Coming in for extraction now.
34,"00:03:01,208","00:03:02,875",Brace for impact.
35,"00:03:08,541","00:03:10,333","Hey, not my People's Choice."
36,"00:03:33,833","00:03:35,250","- Sophie?
- I got you."
37,"00:03:35,333","00:03:36,500",It's gonna be okay.
38,"00:03:45,125","00:03:47,083",How'd you know what they were planning?
39,"00:03:47,166","00:03:48,916",That's not important.
40,"00:03:49,000","00:03:54,083","So for the last time, can I go to the
homecoming dance with Ryan this Saturday?"
41,"00:03:54,166","00:03:55,500",Sorry.
42,"00:03:55,583","00:03:57,666",You've got underwater training scheduled.
43,"00:03:59,833","00:04:01,708",What are you doing?
44,"00:04:09,208","00:04:11,458","- Hey, Sophie?
- Hmm?"
45,"00:04:11,541","00:04:13,208",I can't go to the dance with you.
46,"00:04:13,291","00:04:14,791",I asked Olivia Rodrigo.
47,"00:04:14,875","00:04:16,375",Hmm.
48,"00:04:16,458","00:04:17,916",Wait.
49,"00:04:18,000","00:04:20,000",No!
50,"00:04:30,666","00:04:32,375",That was weird.
51,"00:04:38,000","00:04:39,541","Here you go, Oz."
52,"00:04:39,625","00:04:41,541",All right. Yeah.
53,"00:04:43,000","00:04:44,708","Hey, Blueberry."
54,"00:04:44,791","00:04:46,000","There you go, pal."
55,"00:04:46,083","00:04:48,208",You're looking very handsome today.
56,"00:04:48,291","00:04:50,666","Sophie, food's getting cold."
57,"00:04:50,750","00:04:52,500",Made your favorite... scones.
58,"00:04:52,583","00:04:54,458",But muffins are my favorite.
59,"00:04:54,541","00:04:57,125","I tried making muffins,
but they didn't rise."
60,"00:04:57,208","00:04:58,833",And now they are scones.
61,"00:04:58,916","00:05:00,583",What is going on with your hair?
62,"00:05:01,666","00:05:03,625","Still got bed head.
Supposed to be out the door."
63,"00:05:03,708","00:05:06,041","It's fine.
I have free period this morning,"
64,"00:05:06,125","00:05:08,500","then seminar advisory,
which I can just blow off."
65,"00:05:08,583","00:05:10,333","No, blowing off is a bad habit."
66,"00:05:10,416","00:05:12,291",I'm not letting you start bad habits.
67,"00:05:12,375","00:05:14,625",I need you there at 0900.
68,"00:05:14,708","00:05:17,541","- Did you hear me, young lady?
- Mm-hmm."
69,"00:05:17,625","00:05:20,458","Is that a ""mm-hmm"" like you heard me
or a ""mm-hmm"" like ""shut up""?"
70,"00:05:20,541","00:05:23,125","Yes, I will be there at 0900."
71,"00:05:23,208","00:05:25,184","Geez, just 'cause you think
you can act like my dad"
72,"00:05:25,208","00:05:26,625",doesn't mean that you are my dad.
73,"00:05:27,708","00:05:29,041",'Cause you are not.
74,"00:05:38,791","00:05:40,059","- Hey.
- Hey, babe."
75,"00:05:40,083","00:05:42,708","- How are you?
- Well, we finally got here and settled in."
76,"00:05:42,791","00:05:44,666",The people are so great.
77,"00:05:44,750","00:05:46,208","And, boy, did they need us."
78,"00:05:46,291","00:05:48,708",Nurses for Global Health to the rescue.
79,"00:05:48,791","00:05:50,208",What's Rwanda like?
80,"00:05:50,291","00:05:52,166",It's unbelievable.
81,"00:05:52,250","00:05:54,458",But how about you? How's everything?
82,"00:05:54,541","00:05:56,375","- Hi, Mom.
- Hey, sweetheart."
83,"00:05:56,458","00:05:58,041",Don't feed your scones to Ozzie.
84,"00:05:58,125","00:06:00,250",And we have practice today... 1600.
85,"00:06:00,333","00:06:02,125","Yes, drill sergeant."
86,"00:06:02,208","00:06:03,916","It's called ""four o'clock."""
87,"00:06:04,000","00:06:05,458","So, how's it really going?"
88,"00:06:05,541","00:06:08,375","I mean, my suggestions
used to be considered useful,"
89,"00:06:08,458","00:06:10,750",my jokes funny.
90,"00:06:10,833","00:06:14,583","Today, after I simply reminded her
of the importance of punctuality,"
91,"00:06:14,666","00:06:17,583",she reminded me that I am not her dad.
92,"00:06:17,666","00:06:19,250","But no, it's fine."
93,"00:06:19,333","00:06:20,541",I'm not her real dad.
94,"00:06:20,625","00:06:22,875",I'm just...
95,"00:06:22,958","00:06:24,791",I don't know.
96,"00:06:24,875","00:06:26,250",You have her training every day.
97,"00:06:26,333","00:06:28,253","Try asking her what she wants to do
for a change."
98,"00:06:28,333","00:06:30,166",Sophie loves the dojo.
99,"00:06:30,250","00:06:32,208","- It's her thing.
- Her thing or yours?"
100,"00:06:32,291","00:06:33,750",Just ask her.
101,"00:06:33,833","00:06:35,458",She might really appreciate that.
102,"00:06:35,541","00:06:37,333","She's changing, JJ."
103,"00:06:37,416","00:06:38,541",Be patient.
104,"00:06:47,791","00:06:49,291",Perimeter?
105,"00:06:49,375","00:06:50,875",Looks good.
106,"00:06:50,958","00:06:52,392","Bobbi, can you show me the close camera?"
107,"00:06:52,416","00:06:54,434","And someone needs to finish
these scones that I baked"
108,"00:06:54,458","00:06:56,416",for my little girl who fed 'em to the dog.
109,"00:06:56,500","00:06:58,559","These are pieces of my heart
that you're leaving on this plate, people."
110,"00:06:58,583","00:07:01,125",I'll take one. Thank you.
111,"00:07:01,208","00:07:02,250",Connelly.
112,"00:07:02,333","00:07:03,333",What?
113,"00:07:03,416","00:07:04,958",I'm on Lipitor. I'm allowed.
114,"00:07:06,750","00:07:08,333","We got a bogey, six o'clock."
115,"00:07:37,250","00:07:39,250","Well done, Christina.
You're clear to proceed."
116,"00:07:39,291","00:07:41,416","Copy that. Wish you were with me, friend."
117,"00:07:48,708","00:07:50,875",All right. That's the air-gapped server.
118,"00:07:53,041","00:07:54,642","Gonna need
some help here, Bobbi."
119,"00:07:54,666","00:07:57,291","- What do we got?
- Looks like the lock's a JET-08."
120,"00:07:57,375","00:07:58,833",Sending data package now.
121,"00:08:03,708","00:08:06,148","Christina, we got another bogey
approaching, ten o'clock."
122,"00:08:19,416","00:08:22,666","Time to see if Kim's informant's right
and the data's actually here."
123,"00:08:22,750","00:08:24,791","Good Lord.
We got seven more bogeys approaching."
124,"00:08:24,875","00:08:25,958",Thirty seconds out.
125,"00:08:26,041","00:08:27,625",Need more time.
126,"00:08:27,708","00:08:30,583","- Christina, get out of there. Now!
- No, JJ, wait."
127,"00:08:30,666","00:08:32,583","Christina, you've got this."
128,"00:08:35,291","00:08:38,416","Got it. Got weapons locations
scattered globally."
129,"00:08:38,500","00:08:40,000","I said move, damn it!"
130,"00:08:40,083","00:08:41,791",Almost done.
131,"00:08:41,875","00:08:44,458",Three. Two.
132,"00:08:44,541","00:08:46,021",One.
133,"00:08:56,333","00:08:58,500","Hey. Good work, JJ."
134,"00:08:58,583","00:08:59,916",Thanks.
135,"00:09:00,000","00:09:02,666","- Little touch and go there, but...
- No, I mean the scones."
136,"00:09:02,750","00:09:05,101","At first, I was disappointed
the raisins wasn't chocolate chips."
137,"00:09:05,125","00:09:06,805","I was like,
""Where the chocolate chips at?"""
138,"00:09:06,833","00:09:08,851","'Cause all the scones I had
had chocolate chips before."
139,"00:09:08,875","00:09:12,375","But then, about the fourth bite,
I was like, ""Damn!"""
140,"00:09:13,750","00:09:16,041",They're currants. Thank you.
141,"00:09:17,166","00:09:19,708","Uh, you okay?"
142,"00:09:19,791","00:09:22,000","- Yeah.
- Yeah?"
143,"00:09:22,083","00:09:25,708","'Cause, uh, you're sweating
like you're going through menopause."
144,"00:09:25,791","00:09:27,875","Christina had that,
and you almost shut it down."
145,"00:09:27,958","00:09:29,958","But I didn't, did I?"
146,"00:10:13,625","00:10:15,458",Sir? You wanted to see me?
147,"00:10:15,541","00:10:17,875",I heard we were successful. Congrats.
148,"00:10:17,958","00:10:19,500",Yeah. Thank you.
149,"00:10:19,583","00:10:20,958","So, what did this data reveal?"
150,"00:10:21,041","00:10:23,561","At the end of the Cold War,
when the Soviets were falling apart,"
151,"00:10:23,625","00:10:28,250","the KGB set out to hide weapons all around
the world for a potential first strike."
152,"00:10:28,333","00:10:31,500","Suitcase nukes,
each weighing less than 50 pounds."
153,"00:10:31,583","00:10:33,750",Portable so they can be moved
154,"00:10:33,833","00:10:36,041","but carrying a blast capability
of one kiloton."
155,"00:10:36,125","00:10:40,125","In 1973, NATO intelligence intercepted
a top secret Soviet document"
156,"00:10:40,208","00:10:42,916","containing activation codes
for these weapons."
157,"00:10:43,000","00:10:44,916",But these weapons could not be found.
158,"00:10:45,000","00:10:47,666",Over a hundred nukes went missing.
159,"00:10:47,750","00:10:51,041","So, hopefully, this data that you helped
retrieve will tell us where they are."
160,"00:10:51,125","00:10:53,041","- I'm glad that tip worked out.
- Yes."
161,"00:10:53,125","00:10:54,875",Step one: finding them.
162,"00:10:54,958","00:10:57,208",Step two: acquire and neutralize.
163,"00:10:57,291","00:11:00,625","Step three: getting you back
in the field, JJ."
164,"00:11:00,708","00:11:02,916",I need you to finish this mission.
165,"00:11:03,000","00:11:04,416","You know I can't do that, sir."
166,"00:11:04,500","00:11:05,333","When I moved here three years ago, I
made..."
167,"00:11:05,416","00:11:06,416","Yeah, I know."
168,"00:11:06,500","00:11:08,208",You made a promise.
169,"00:11:08,291","00:11:12,625","No more fieldwork,
focus more on intel and family."
170,"00:11:14,500","00:11:17,261","I just want to live long enough
to walk Sophie down the aisle one day."
171,"00:11:17,291","00:11:19,166",Fieldwork is behind me. I've changed.
172,"00:11:19,250","00:11:21,416","Oh, quit the crap, JJ."
173,"00:11:21,500","00:11:25,166","I need my number one bull elephant
heading this mission."
174,"00:11:25,250","00:11:26,666",And Connelly can't do it.
175,"00:11:26,750","00:11:28,375",He scheduled a colonoscopy.
176,"00:11:28,458","00:11:30,708","He already picked up
the gallon of orange goo,"
177,"00:11:30,791","00:11:34,000","and he has to be near a latrine
for the next 48 hours."
178,"00:11:34,083","00:11:36,958","Sir, I just want to serve
my country peacefully"
179,"00:11:37,041","00:11:38,958",and be the best father...
180,"00:11:39,041","00:11:40,958",the best guardian I can be.
181,"00:11:43,875","00:11:45,083",Scone?
182,"00:11:45,166","00:11:47,559","They're sugar-free, but you'd
never guess if I didn't tell you."
183,"00:11:47,583","00:11:49,750",They're really good.
184,"00:11:51,875","00:11:53,458",Wait.
185,"00:12:04,958","00:12:06,583","Oh, God."

375,"00:21:25,458","00:21:27,708","I mean, uh, no. No, of course not."
376,"00:21:27,791","00:21:30,083",Pass. Next question.
377,"00:21:31,166","00:21:33,208","- Are you sure you can handle this?
- Yes, ma'am."
378,"00:21:33,291","00:21:35,500",Good. These kids are at a tricky age.
379,"00:21:35,583","00:21:37,958","Raging hormones, poor impulse control."
380,"00:21:38,041","00:21:41,125","Plus, the numbers are stacked
against us 15 to one."
381,"00:21:41,208","00:21:43,916","So stay frosty, soldier boy,
because if you can't hack it,"
382,"00:21:44,000","00:21:46,291","I will dump your ass from chaperone
to the shadow tour"
383,"00:21:46,375","00:21:48,934","with the other loser parents
who want to stay in the nicer hotels"
384,"00:21:48,958","00:21:50,708",and sip chardonnay from a distance.
385,"00:21:50,791","00:21:52,916","The ones who are too afraid
to get their hands dirty"
386,"00:21:53,000","00:21:54,750",in the crap bowl of American youth.
387,"00:21:56,916","00:21:59,458",I did not love that conversation.
388,"00:21:59,541","00:22:01,661","♪ Whoo, hanging low
while I pop a bottle off a yacht ♪"
389,"00:22:01,708","00:22:03,392","♪ Chain swanging, cling-clang and it cost
a lot..."
390,"00:22:04,333","00:22:06,541","So, my name is JJ, and I'm your chaperone."
391,"00:22:06,625","00:22:09,416","Okay. Huddle up, guys. Come on."
392,"00:22:10,500","00:22:13,184","All right, for this mission,
our squad's going into foreign territory,"
393,"00:22:13,208","00:22:15,541","so to succeed,
we're gonna have to maintain"
394,"00:22:15,625","00:22:18,666",a high level of situational awareness.
395,"00:22:18,750","00:22:21,333","Which means we're gonna
have to look out for each other."
396,"00:22:23,250","00:22:24,666","Hey, can you put that down, please?"
397,"00:22:24,750","00:22:26,500",Sorry.
398,"00:22:26,583","00:22:29,059","But I really wanted us to get off
on the right foot, so I brought you guys"
399,"00:22:29,083","00:22:31,083",some fresh-baked cookies...
400,"00:22:31,166","00:22:33,083",and some White Claws.
401,"00:22:35,125","00:22:37,291","Hey, we're gonna get so wasted."
402,"00:22:37,375","00:22:38,916",What the hell are you doing?
403,"00:22:39,000","00:22:42,250","You want to get us kicked off this trip?
You cannot give these kids alcohol."
404,"00:22:42,333","00:22:43,500",It's not real.
405,"00:22:43,583","00:22:46,083","I had Langley fabricate the cans
with some carbonated water."
406,"00:22:46,166","00:22:48,166","Well, that's putting our tax dollars
to good use."
407,"00:22:48,250","00:22:49,458",What were you thinking?
408,"00:22:49,541","00:22:51,000","First of all, you don't pay taxes."
409,"00:22:51,083","00:22:54,750","Second, I just want us to have a good time
and I want your friends to like me."
410,"00:22:54,833","00:22:56,184","You don't
have to walk me in, Dad."
411,"00:22:56,208","00:22:59,375","Ah, of course I do.
I'm not gonna see you for ten whole days."
412,"00:22:59,458","00:23:00,750",Give me a kiss. Come on.
413,"00:23:00,833","00:23:02,916","- Dad.
- Oh, don't Nemo me."
414,"00:23:03,000","00:23:05,708","Kiss me on the cheek, or so help me,
when this bus pulls away,"
415,"00:23:05,791","00:23:07,125","I will run after you screaming,"
416,"00:23:07,208","00:23:09,666","""Hey, Collin, you forgot
your diarrhea medication!"""
417,"00:23:09,750","00:23:11,791","- Okay. Okay.
- All right."
418,"00:23:11,875","00:23:13,375",There you go. Was that so hard?
419,"00:23:13,458","00:23:14,934","Please, Dad, stop."
420,"00:23:14,958","00:23:16,559","Okay, one-one more, one more."
421,"00:23:16,583","00:23:18,041","- Bye, Dad.
- Goodbye."
422,"00:23:18,125","00:23:19,392","Oh, I have something more to tell you."
423,"00:23:19,416","00:23:20,708","- Bye, Dad.
- Okay."
424,"00:23:21,541","00:23:24,041","What? There's nothing wrong
with expressing your feelings."
425,"00:23:24,125","00:23:26,833","What about expressing your saliva
all over Collin's cheek?"
426,"00:23:26,916","00:23:30,333","My son is the reason I agreed
to give you this time off."
427,"00:23:30,416","00:23:32,791","I want you to keep an eye on him.
He's sensitive."
428,"00:23:32,875","00:23:35,184","This is gonna be the first time
Collin hasn't slept in his own bed"
429,"00:23:35,208","00:23:36,625",since his mom died three years ago.
430,"00:23:36,708","00:23:39,625",Don't worry. He'll be in good hands.
431,"00:23:39,708","00:23:41,333",What's up with the Peppa Pig scrubs?
432,"00:23:41,416","00:23:43,958","You know, Collin still thinks
I'm a pediatric nurse."
433,"00:23:44,041","00:23:47,281","When are you gonna tell him that you're
the head of covert operations for the CIA?"
434,"00:23:47,333","00:23:50,208",Keeping him in the dark keeps him safe.
435,"00:23:50,291","00:23:52,666","And I trust you told Sophie
not to tell him?"
436,"00:23:52,750","00:23:55,041","- Yeah. Many times.
- I got to go."
437,"00:23:55,125","00:23:57,041","Have fun with the choir, JJ."
438,"00:23:57,125","00:23:58,250","Thanks, Chief."
439,"00:23:58,333","00:24:00,333",Was that as bad as it felt?
440,"00:24:00,416","00:24:02,208",A man making out with his son?
441,"00:24:02,291","00:24:03,708","No, it wasn't great."
442,"00:24:03,791","00:24:05,500",Collin!
443,"00:24:05,583","00:24:07,000",I love you!
444,"00:24:07,083","00:24:08,750",He's so embarrassing.
445,"00:24:08,833","00:24:10,000",Collin!
446,"00:24:11,083","00:24:12,250",I'll be right back.
447,"00:24:12,333","00:24:14,625","I got to run to the store
and buy some tampons."
448,"00:24:14,708","00:24:16,958",Acknowledge me!
449,"00:24:23,666","00:24:26,166",Are you guys seeing this? St. Mark's.
450,"00:24:26,250","00:24:29,458","It was consecrated
over a thousand years ago."
451,"00:24:29,541","00:24:32,541","And, uh, that's..."
452,"00:24:32,625","00:24:37,333","that's the doge's palace,
apparently Venice's most iconic landmark."
453,"00:24:38,875","00:24:41,458",And I'm having an affair with Lady Gaga.
454,"00:24:43,000","00:24:45,625","I can say this because
no one's listening or cares."
455,"00:24:46,708","00:24:48,642","Maybe they're all wasted
from the fake White Claws."
456,"00:24:48,666","00:24:49,666",Funny.
457,"00:24:49,750","00:24:51,250",Here. I got you something.
458,"00:24:51,333","00:24:52,517","I know it's not your birthday,"
459,"00:24:52,541","00:24:54,392","but I wanted to wait till we got here
to give you this."
460,"00:24:54,416","00:24:56,541","- Really?
- Open it."
461,"00:24:59,750","00:25:01,875","It's not an iPhone, but this is better."
462,"00:25:01,958","00:25:06,833","Enhanced tracking, satellite capabilities,
a stun light and a built-in Taser."
463,"00:25:06,916","00:25:08,642","And the best thing about this...
when you're done with it,"
464,"00:25:08,666","00:25:09,833",just throw it away.
465,"00:25:09,916","00:25:11,625",You got me a used burner phone.
466,"00:25:11,708","00:25:14,541","Maybe I can use it to buy some meth
or order a hit man."
467,"00:25:14,625","00:25:15,833",Don't be ridiculous.
468,"00:25:15,916","00:25:18,166","If you need a hit man,
come to me for the referral."
469,"00:25:18,250","00:25:20,041",I got you a spare battery.
470,"00:25:20,125","00:25:23,005","Now, Langley puts E-tags on these
so they can track them if they're lost."
471,"00:25:23,041","00:25:25,309","Don't even think about losing it,
'cause those are expensive."
472,"00:25:28,083","00:25:29,375",You're welcome.
473,"00:25:48,708","00:25:50,041","Hi, JJ."
474,"00:25:50,125","00:25:52,666","Second-guessing your decision
to come on this trip?"
475,"00:25:52,750","00:25:56,416","No, not at all, although...
it is a little like herding kittens."
476,"00:25:57,500","00:25:59,583",How is it anything like hurting kittens?
477,"00:25:59,666","00:26:01,916","No, herding."
478,"00:26:02,000","00:26:04,291",Herd-ing kittens.
479,"00:26:04,375","00:26:06,708",Ah. 'Kay.
480,"00:26:06,791","00:26:10,041","Anyway, we made it,
and as long as bed check was fine"
481,"00:26:10,125","00:26:12,625","and the kids are all squared away,
we are good."
482,"00:26:12,708","00:26:14,083",Yep. All good.
483,"00:26:14,166","00:26:16,541","Great. Just remember
I need your bed check roll call"
484,"00:26:16,625","00:26:18,291",emailed to me every night at 10:00 sharp.
485,"00:26:18,375","00:26:21,000","I've got a lot of nervous parents
that I need to keep happy."
486,"00:26:21,083","00:26:22,666",Got it. Ten sharp.
487,"00:26:22,750","00:26:24,708","- Have a good night, then.
- Good night."
488,"00:26:30,333","00:26:32,208",Bed check.
489,"00:26:34,875","00:26:36,875","Oh, God."
490,"00:26:36,958","00:26:38,583",Bed check.
491,"00:26:41,291","00:26:43,041","Oh, God."
492,"00:26:43,125","00:26:45,208","Oh, no."
493,"00:26:45,291","00:26:46,651",Bed check.
494,"00:26:47,958","00:26:49,958",Sophie?

do your job for you again."

523,"00:28:18,208","00:28:19,541",You got us in trouble.

531,"00:28:40,166","00:28:42,125",You have got to give me some space.
532,"00:28:42,208","00:28:43,333","Well, I can't."
533,"00:28:43,416","00:28:46,333","Because you asked me to come,

534,"00:28:47,791","00:28:51,041","JJ, I am going to have fun on this trip,"

562,"00:30:57,666","00:30:59,684","All right, we've got an hour
till the buses leave for Florence."
563,"00:30:59,708","00:31:02,708","- Let's pack 'em and stack 'em.
- Yes, ma'am."
564,"00:31:02,791","00:31:04,000",Hey.
565,"00:31:04,083","00:31:06,625","Do you guys want to sneak out tonight
when we get to Florence?"
566,"00:31:06,708","00:31:08,476","You're not worried about
getting in trouble again?"
567,"00:31:08,500","00:31:10,625","Oh, come on. It'll be fun."
568,"00:31:10,708","00:31:12,434","Yeah, 'cause statistically,
we've only gotten in trouble"
569,"00:31:12,458","00:31:14,500",one out of one times on this trip so far.
570,"00:31:33,958","00:31:38,000","Guys, if you look out to the left,
you will see the Santa Maria Novella."
571,"00:31:38,083","00:31:40,666","It says that it was built
in the first half of the 13th century"
572,"00:31:40,750","00:31:42,916","and it's considered
one of the most important points"
573,"00:31:43,000","00:31:45,250","of religious
and artistic interest in Italy."
574,"00:31:46,291","00:31:49,666","And hey, if you look to the right,
you will see the Duomo."
575,"00:31:49,750","00:31:51,208","Uh, there it is. There it is."
576,"00:31:51,291","00:31:53,184","I can't actually... can't believe
that we're here seeing that."
577,"00:31:53,208","00:31:54,583","You see that, guys?"
578,"00:31:54,666","00:31:56,416","Right over there?
Look how amazing that is."
579,"00:31:56,500","00:31:58,500",Are you guys excited to see that? I am.
580,"00:32:29,500","00:32:30,708","Hey, guys."
581,"00:32:30,791","00:32:32,934","Let's turn in early
so we're fresh for tomorrow, all right?"
582,"00:32:32,958","00:32:35,541","Okay, JJ. By the way,
I enjoyed your guided tour."
583,"00:32:35,625","00:32:38,375","I had no idea the Duomo
took 142 years to build."
584,"00:32:38,458","00:32:40,041","Thanks, Collin."
585,"00:32:54,875","00:32:56,500",Don't be such a kiss-ass.
586,"00:32:56,583","00:32:57,875",He was terrible.
587,"00:32:57,958","00:33:00,625","That guided tour took
142 years off my life."
588,"00:33:00,708","00:33:03,601","I know, but the best way to sneak
past the warden is to be his best friend."
589,"00:33:03,625","00:33:05,833",What was he so cheery about?
590,"00:33:05,916","00:33:07,000",Good question.
591,"00:33:07,083","00:33:08,791","So, how late is this place open?"
592,"00:33:08,875","00:33:10,041",I don't know.
593,"00:33:10,125","00:33:12,333","But I do know it has
the best gelato in Italy."
594,"00:33:12,416","00:33:14,309","It's the perfect place
to ask Ryan to homecoming."
595,"00:33:14,333","00:33:16,166","Oh, geez."
596,"00:33:16,250","00:33:17,375","Please, Collin."
597,"00:33:17,458","00:33:19,083",I need you to do this for me.
598,"00:33:19,166","00:33:20,375",I'll owe you forever.
599,"00:33:25,916","00:33:27,250",Whoa.
600,"00:33:27,333","00:33:29,833","I have a camera in the plug
and one in the vent."
601,"00:33:32,083","00:33:33,583",What's he doing?
602,"00:33:45,375","00:33:46,875",A tracker.
603,"00:33:46,958","00:33:49,916","Not as smart as you think you are, JJ."
604,"00:33:50,000","00:33:51,708",Where'd you learn how to do all this?
605,"00:33:51,791","00:33:53,375","Ironically, he taught me."
606,"00:33:53,458","00:33:54,666",That's so cool.
607,"00:33:54,750","00:33:55,958","- Really?
- Yeah."
608,"00:33:56,041","00:33:57,708",My dad's totally boring.
609,"00:33:57,791","00:34:00,125",What are you talking about? Your dad's...
610,"00:34:00,208","00:34:02,041",probably cooler than you think he is.
611,"00:34:02,125","00:34:03,375",Unlikely.
612,"00:34:03,458","00:34:06,458","It's almost time for bed check.
It's now or never. I got to get ready."
613,"00:34:06,541","00:34:09,166","What about JJ? He leaves his door open.
How do we get by?"
614,"00:34:09,250","00:34:11,291",Trust me.
615,"00:34:11,375","00:34:13,250",I know all his moves.
616,"00:34:46,250","00:34:47,708",Follow me.
617,"00:34:52,666","00:34:54,666","Hey, come on, man. You got this."
618,"00:34:55,750","00:34:57,166","Oh, God."
619,"00:35:24,875","00:35:26,333",Damn.
620,"00:35:26,416","00:35:28,583","- How'd you find the trackers?
- Nanny-cammed you."
621,"00:35:28,666","00:35:30,416","- Nice.
- How'd you get us?"
622,"00:35:30,500","00:35:32,583","- Trip-wired the boys' door.
- Not bad."
623,"00:35:32,666","00:35:34,684","Now, why don't you guys turn around
and go back to your rooms."
624,"00:35:34,708","00:35:37,166","- JJ.
- No, I mean it. Now."
625,"00:35:40,083","00:35:42,041","Sorry, guys."
626,"00:35:45,125","00:35:46,666","All right, I'll tell you what."
627,"00:35:46,750","00:35:48,601","I'll let you guys stay up
a little past your bedtime."
628,"00:35:48,625","00:35:51,041",There is 40 minutes to curfew.
629,"00:35:51,125","00:35:54,541","If you guys promise to be
back in your rooms in 35 minutes,"
630,"00:35:54,625","00:35:56,125",I'll pretend like I didn't see you.
631,"00:35:59,625","00:36:02,166","Thank you, Mr. Jones.
Hey, you're pretty cool."
632,"00:36:04,416","00:36:05,708",Yeah.
633,"00:36:05,791","00:36:07,125",Pretty cool.
634,"00:36:13,708","00:36:15,791",How much do I owe you?
635,"00:36:23,958","00:36:25,875",There it is. Just ahead.
636,"00:36:27,500","00:36:28,916",What? Oh.
637,"00:36:29,000","00:36:31,875","Oh, no. I totally left my medicine
back at the hotel."
638,"00:36:31,958","00:36:33,791",I better go get it.
639,"00:36:33,875","00:36:35,333",It's for worms.
640,"00:36:35,416","00:36:36,958",I got pinworms from my dog.
641,"00:36:37,041","00:36:41,041","But don't worry, the medicine's working
and I'm turning the corner on the worms."
642,"00:36:41,125","00:36:42,708",My butt hardly itches at all anymore.
643,"00:36:44,041","00:36:46,125",I'll catch up with you later.
644,"00:36:47,208","00:36:49,666","- That was weird.
- Yeah."
645,"00:36:53,291","00:36:55,250",I'm never gonna live that down.
646,"00:36:55,333","00:36:56,973",Now say exactly what I say to the server.
647,"00:37:01,833","00:37:03,833","That's dope.
I didn't know you could speak Italian."
648,"00:37:03,916","00:37:05,250","Well, yeah."
649,"00:37:05,333","00:37:07,333","Uh, I didn't, either, till just now."
650,"00:37:07,416","00:37:09,583","Oh, maybe if you helped me
rehearse for the play,"
651,"00:37:09,666","00:37:11,947","you'd know I learned some Italian.
Now, tell the server..."
652,"00:37:15,750","00:37:18,333","So cool. Hey, listen,
I'll get the next one, okay?"
653,"00:37:18,416","00:37:20,125",The next one?
654,"00:37:20,208","00:37:21,666",Yeah.
655,"00:37:21,750","00:37:23,583",I like hanging out with you.
656,"00:37:23,666","00:37:25,458",Let's take a pic. Come on.
657,"00:37:37,083","00:37:39,791","Hey, something's really wrong.
I'm so sorry, but I'll be right back."
658,"00:37:39,875","00:37:41,208",Hey!
659,"00:37:44,666","00:37:46,791",Hey! Hey!
660,"00:38:02,208","00:38:04,250",Sorry. Scusa.
661,"00:38:20,625","00:38:22,305","Oh, damn it."
662,"00:38:22,375","00:38:24,333",Damn it. How much do I owe you?
663,"00:38:46,375","00:38:47,726",Whoa.
664,"00:38:52,000","00:38:53,875",Are you okay?
665,"00:38:53,958","00:38:55,416",They took Collin.
666,"00:38:55,500","00:38:57,208","- Who took Collin?
- I don't know."
667,"00:39:02,791","00:39:04,125",How's my little cocoa bean?
668,"00:39:04,208","00:39:06,267","We have
your son, Mr. Kim."
669,"00:39:06,291","00:39:08,416",Come to Rome alone
670,"00:39:08,500","00:39:11,291","to the following coordinates
for further instructions."
671,"00:39:11,375","00:39:14,583","If you tell anyone, including the CIA,"
672,"00:39:14,666","00:39:17,125",we'll know and the boy dies.
673,"00:39:24,541","00:39:26,184","- Something just happened.
- Stop."
674,"00:39:26,208","00:39:28,166","Nothing over the phone.
Cover Collin's absence."
675,"00:39:28,250","00:39:30,130","Get to Rome ASAP.
I'll send you the coordinates."
676,"00:39:30,208","00:39:32,041","Don't do or say anything
until I get there."
677,"00:39:32,125","00:39:33,485",There's no knowing who's involved.
678,"00:39:34,500","00:39:36,000",Here.
679,"00:39:41,333","00:39:43,250",You recognize him.
680,"00:39:43,333","00:39:45,333",Yeah. Bishop Crane.
681,"00:39:45,416","00:39:46,625",He's as bad as they come.
682,"00:39:46,708","00:39:48,916","Assassination, extortion, trafficking."
683,"00:39:49,000","00:39:50,520",There's nothing he won't do for money.
684,"00:39:50,583","00:39:52,416",Why would he want to kidnap Collin?
685,"00:39:53,666","00:39:56,416","JJ, what are you not telling me?"
686,"00:39:56,500","00:39:58,500",We were in the Special Forces together.
687,"00:39:58,583","00:40:02,500","Crane was the new guy in an elite unit
doing drug interdiction in Colombia."
688,"00:40:02,583","00:40:05,166","He sold us out to the cartel,
made millions."
689,"00:40:05,250","00:40:06,750",Your unit?
690,"00:40:06,833","00:40:09,000",I was the only one who survived.
691,"00:40:09,083","00:40:10,583",Whoa.
692,"00:40:10,666","00:40:11,916",I'm sorry.
693,"00:40:12,000","00:40:14,750","If Crane is involved,
whoever he's working for is very powerful."
694,"00:40:14,833","00:40:16,958","I've got to get the other chaperones
to cover for me."
695,"00:40:17,041","00:40:18,458",You won't be safe here.
696,"00:40:18,541","00:40:19,791",You're coming with me.
697,"00:40:19,875","00:40:21,041",Where are we going?
698,"00:40:45,833","00:40:47,666",There he is.
699,"00:40:54,416","00:40:55,875",Wait.
700,"00:40:55,958","00:40:57,875",We got to keep our distance.
701,"00:40:57,958","00:40:59,875",He's being watched.
702,"00:41:33,000","00:41:34,583","All right, come on."
703,"00:41:47,666","00:41:48,666",Get in.
704,"00:41:53,125","00:41:54,916",I asked you to do one thing.
705,"00:41:55,000","00:41:56,916",One. You failed.
706,"00:41:57,000","00:41:59,916","This would've never happened
under the old JJ's watch."
707,"00:42:00,000","00:42:01,625",Bobbi? What are you doing here?
708,"00:42:01,708","00:42:02,958",I asked her to be here.
709,"00:42:03,041","00:42:06,375","I needed a tech, and everybody knows
techs are basically expendable."
710,"00:42:06,458","00:42:08,166",Right.
711,"00:42:08,250","00:42:10,208","The better question is:
What are you doing here?"
712,"00:42:10,291","00:42:12,041","- Collin is my friend.
- Yeah."
713,"00:42:12,125","00:42:14,892","And if whoever Crane is working for
knows about you, then they know about me."
714,"00:42:14,916","00:42:16,625",Which also means Sophie's at risk.
715,"00:42:16,708","00:42:18,250",I can't leave her behind.
716,"00:42:18,333","00:42:20,000","Chief, what is that?"
717,"00:42:21,083","00:42:22,708",About to find out.
718,"00:42:26,916","00:42:29,416","Breach
NATO vault at Aviano."
719,"00:42:29,500","00:42:32,750","Retrieve activation codes
to trade for your son."
720,"00:42:34,166","00:42:35,250",Whoa.
721,"00:42:35,333","00:42:36,375",Aviano?
722,"00:42:36,458","00:42:37,833",It's an air base.
723,"00:42:37,916","00:42:39,166",Activation codes?
724,"00:42:39,250","00:42:41,666","Christina never made it to Berlin
with that thumb drive."
725,"00:42:41,750","00:42:43,958",If these kidnappers have that drive...
726,"00:42:44,041","00:42:46,517","It would mean they would know the location
of a hundred missing nukes."
727,"00:42:46,541","00:42:47,791",Why you?
728,"00:42:47,875","00:42:49,458",They need someone who can get in.
729,"00:42:49,541","00:42:51,861","My rank with the CIA will grant me access
to any NATO base."
730,"00:42:51,916","00:42:53,892","Yeah, but getting into the vault
under heavy security"
731,"00:42:53,916","00:42:55,101",is gonna be nearly impossible.
732,"00:42:55,125","00:42:57,458","Which is why we need
to make one stop first."
733,"00:43:28,083","00:43:30,750","Why are you doing this?
We don't have any money."
734,"00:43:31,958","00:43:36,333","You know, you remind me
a little of myself at your age."
735,"00:43:41,625","00:43:44,166",I hated myself at your age.
736,"00:43:50,541","00:43:52,458","All right,
listen up, everybody."
737,"00:43:52,541","00:43:54,500","There have been
a lot of rumors flying around,"
738,"00:43:54,583","00:43:56,583","so I wanted to take a moment
to address them."
739,"00:43:56,666","00:43:59,833","First of all, everything's fine."
740,"00:43:59,916","00:44:02,791","Collin needed to return home
due to a family emergency,"
741,"00:44:02,875","00:44:05,333",and JJ and Sophie are accompanying.
742,"00:44:05,416","00:44:07,375",I'll keep you all updated.
743,"00:44:07,458","00:44:10,458","But in the meantime,
who's excited to go to Rome"
744,"00:44:10,541","00:44:12,421",and sing at the Vatican?
745,"00:44:12,458","00:44:14,333",Yeah.
746,"00:44:18,083","00:44:19,791",This is an MI6 safe house.
747,"00:44:19,875","00:44:21,750","It's got everything we need
for this mission:"
748,"00:44:21,833","00:44:23,625","weapons, external hard drive
for the codes."
749,"00:44:23,708","00:44:25,541","There's even a surveillance van
in the garage."
750,"00:44:25,625","00:44:27,105","Best of all, no one's here right now."
751,"00:44:27,166","00:44:30,208","Day manager is this little old lady
who goes home at 7:00."
752,"00:44:30,291","00:44:33,333","You sure we shouldn't loop in CIA,
get support from local authorities?"
753,"00:44:33,416","00:44:35,291","I'm not risking my son, JJ."
754,"00:44:35,375","00:44:37,500","- This is the only way to play it.
- Hmm."
755,"00:44:37,583","00:44:40,375","Looks like a pretty solid
security camera system on the perimeter."
756,"00:44:40,458","00:44:42,125","Yes, but on the ground floor only."
757,"00:44:42,208","00:44:44,375",We'll break in from the second story.
758,"00:44:44,458","00:44:46,000",Put this on till we're inside.
759,"00:44:46,083","00:44:48,708","Okay, we're in and out in five minutes.
Let's go."
760,"00:45:12,166","00:45:14,041",The old lady's got a lot of birds.
761,"00:45:14,125","00:45:16,500","Yeah, let's get to work.
But let's be careful."
762,"00:45:16,583","00:45:19,375","A lot of these safe houses
are booby-trapped for security."
763,"00:45:47,250","00:45:48,791",Got everything?
764,"00:45:48,875","00:45:50,125","- Yeah. Let's move.
- Okay."
765,"00:45:50,208","00:45:51,500",There's the van.
766,"00:46:09,708","00:46:11,291",Just time the gap.
767,"00:46:11,375","00:46:13,083",Jump through.
768,"00:46:14,750","00:46:16,125",Time the gap?
769,"00:46:16,208","00:46:17,750",I need a much bigger gap than you.
770,"00:46:19,500","00:46:20,625",Huh.
771,"00:46:22,875","00:46:24,416",How'd the birds get out?
772,"00:46:24,500","00:46:25,583",I don't know.
773,"00:46:28,000","00:46:29,416","Hey, little guys."
774,"00:46:35,583","00:46:37,166",Booby trap!
775,"00:46:41,875","00:46:43,791",Get 'em off!
776,"00:46:43,875","00:46:46,750",What's that lady feed these things?
777,"00:46:46,833","00:46:49,750",My guess? Nothing!
778,"00:46:58,041","00:47:00,250","Oh, thank God."
779,"00:47:06,083","00:47:07,291","Oh, shit."
780,"00:47:07,375","00:47:09,625","JJ, now!"
781,"00:47:14,083","00:47:16,000",Who the hell trains attack finches?
782,"00:47:16,083","00:47:18,458",British have a strange sense of humor.
783,"00:47:18,541","00:47:19,708",We better move.
784,"00:47:19,791","00:47:22,416",We may have company.
785,"00:47:23,625","00:47:25,916","Goodbye, nasty widdle birdies."
786,"00:47:28,750","00:47:31,666","Aw, did that hurt your widdle beak?"
787,"00:47:31,750","00:47:33,541",Fucker.
788,"00:47:33,625","00:47:36,625","- So you're like, what, ten now?
- Fourteen."
789,"00:47:36,708","00:47:39,041","Like I said, 14."
790,"00:47:39,125","00:47:41,416",Got any boyfriends yet?
791,"00:47:41,500","00:47:43,166",Uh...
792,"00:47:43,250","00:47:44,875","I don't know, maybe."
793,"00:47:44,958","00:47:47,250",Oh. Okay.
794,"00:47:47,333","00:47:49,750",I knew it. That's why I'm an analyst.
795,"00:47:49,833","00:47:51,416",Although you got my age wrong.
796,"00:47:51,500","00:47:53,458",Here's some advice.
797,"00:47:53,541","00:47:56,458","When you go in for that first kiss,"
798,"00:47:56,541","00:47:58,541",don't be afraid to use lots of tongue.
799,"00:47:58,625","00:47:59,708",Get sloppy.
800,"00:48:00,791","00:48:03,500","- Really?
- Oh, heck yeah."
801,"00:48:03,583","00:48:07,000","Be like a cleaner shrimp
in a shark's mouth."
802,"00:48:07,083","00:48:09,833","Explore that wet hole
like a blind man's cane."
803,"00:48:11,083","00:48:12,958",Wow.
804,"00:48:13,041","00:48:16,250","You know, it's really surprising
no one's snatched you up yet."
805,"00:48:17,541","00:48:21,458","Yeah, well, I do the snatching."
806,"00:48:29,208","00:48:31,083","Hey, did you shut the fan off?"
807,"00:48:31,166","00:48:32,666",No. Why?
808,"00:48:32,750","00:48:35,125",Oh!
809,"00:48:40,458","00:48:41,833",This is taking too long.
810,"00:48:41,916","00:48:43,976","They're highly trained professionals.
They'll be fine."
811,"00:48:47,666","00:48:49,875",They're eating my nipples!
812,"00:48:49,958","00:48:52,333",Or maybe not.
813,"00:49:06,500","00:49:08,166","- Can I help you?
- Yes."
814,"00:49:08,250","00:49:10,083","Kim, CIA.
We're here to see Colonel Minelli."
815,"00:49:13,958","00:49:15,351","All right, the vault with the codes"
816,"00:49:15,375","00:49:17,041",is in that building.
817,"00:49:17,125","00:49:19,583","Bobbi, can you hack through security
and get access?"
818,"00:49:19,666","00:49:21,208","What, am I new?"
819,"00:49:21,291","00:49:22,458",And?
820,"00:49:23,541","00:49:24,851","- So, what, that's it?
- Of course not."
821,"00:49:24,875","00:49:27,559","Let me just whip the spreadsheet
with the detailed plan out of my ass."
822,"00:49:27,583","00:49:29,500","Yes, that's it."
823,"00:49:39,708","00:49:41,916","Kim, you son of a bitch."
824,"00:49:42,000","00:49:43,375",You guys on good terms?
825,"00:49:43,458","00:49:45,416","- He's like a brother.
- Oh, that's nice."
826,"00:49:45,500","00:49:47,916","In that he hates me,
we were in love with the same woman"
827,"00:49:48,000","00:49:49,333",and I owe him about eight grand.
828,"00:49:49,416","00:49:51,500","Colonel, it's good to see you."
829,"00:49:55,208","00:49:57,125","This is my good friend Colonel Minelli,"
830,"00:49:57,208","00:49:59,875","who has a lot of trouble
expressing his affection."
831,"00:49:59,958","00:50:02,791","And, Colonel, this is my..."
832,"00:50:02,875","00:50:05,416","stepbrother JJ, who is loaning us his van,"
833,"00:50:05,500","00:50:09,416",my stepdaughter Sophie and my...
834,"00:50:12,583","00:50:14,833",...wife Bobbi.
835,"00:50:14,916","00:50:16,500",You're about ten years late.
836,"00:50:16,583","00:50:18,166",Did you bring me my money?
837,"00:50:18,250","00:50:19,833",Of course.
838,"00:50:22,625","00:50:24,708","Welcome, my old friend!"
839,"00:50:26,166","00:50:28,416","- Benvenuta.
- Mm-hmm."
840,"00:50:29,500","00:50:31,208",Benvenuta.
841,"00:50:32,250","00:50:34,208",Benvenut... Yeah.
842,"00:50:35,750","00:50:38,250","Why did you decide to come here now
after all of these years?"
843,"00:50:38,333","00:50:39,916",Family vacay.
844,"00:50:40,000","00:50:41,333",Heading north to Lake Como.
845,"00:50:41,416","00:50:45,000","We thought we'd stop in, say hello
and settle some old business."
846,"00:50:45,083","00:50:47,791","But that does not make sense,
because Lake Como is west."
847,"00:50:47,875","00:50:49,184",That's what I've been telling them.
848,"00:50:49,208","00:50:52,541","But no, because Mom and Dad
are too busy arguing to listen to me,"
849,"00:50:52,625","00:50:56,375","and Uncle JJ can't hear anything
because his ears are cauliflowered shut."
850,"00:50:56,458","00:50:57,708",Dua Lipa?
851,"00:50:57,791","00:50:59,375","Oh, she's good. Yeah."
852,"00:50:59,458","00:51:00,625",Okay.
853,"00:51:00,708","00:51:03,791","Honey, um, can you two boys do
your catching up quickly?"
854,"00:51:03,875","00:51:05,625","'Cause Sophie and I need
to use the restroom"
855,"00:51:05,708","00:51:10,333","and we have those dinner reservations
I've been so looking forward to."
856,"00:51:12,125","00:51:14,000",Mm-mm.
857,"00:51:21,083","00:51:22,750",Your stepbrother is quite large.
858,"00:51:22,833","00:51:25,583","Yes. He used to do MMA,
hence the hearing damage."
859,"00:51:25,666","00:51:27,875","Well, you picked a good day to visit."
860,"00:51:27,958","00:51:29,625",Oh? How is that?
861,"00:51:40,625","00:51:42,000","Oh, boy."
862,"00:51:51,541","00:51:53,458",It's just down the hall and to the right.
863,"00:51:53,541","00:51:55,875","- I'll wait here.
- Grazie."
864,"00:52:05,208","00:52:06,583",Okay.
865,"00:52:06,666","00:52:10,541",Oh. Electromagnetic radiation readings.
866,"00:52:10,625","00:52:11,875",This must be the server room.
867,"00:52:20,083","00:52:21,791",Here.
868,"00:52:26,000","00:52:27,892","A way for the men
to blow off some steam."
869,"00:52:27,916","00:52:30,000","- I can see that.
- It's good to see you, Kim."
870,"00:52:30,083","00:52:32,184","And I'm glad you came here
to finally settle your debt."
871,"00:52:32,208","00:52:33,416","Yes, about that..."
872,"00:52:33,500","00:52:36,625","Nine thousand euros should cover
everything you owe me, plus interest."
873,"00:52:36,708","00:52:38,791","I forgot it was that much.
Do you take Discover?"
874,"00:52:38,875","00:52:40,291",Cash only.
875,"00:52:40,375","00:52:43,583",But maybe he can help pay your debt.
876,"00:52:43,666","00:52:45,333",Let's go double or nothing.
877,"00:52:46,333","00:52:49,708","We have got to tread water
while Bobbi gets the codes."
878,"00:52:49,791","00:52:53,208","Most of the men on this base must be
in here, so it's the perfect diversion."
879,"00:52:53,291","00:52:54,811",I'd knock that guy out in ten seconds.
880,"00:52:54,875","00:52:57,708","Negative. You'll engage with him
until I give you the all clear."

933,"00:55:27,166","00:55:28,916",That's what you said an hour ago.
934,"00:55:29,000","00:55:31,041","Hey, I know this is hard,
but you know the drill."
935,"00:55:31,125","00:55:34,500","They'll make contact, show proof of life,
then give us the drop-off."
936,"00:55:34,583","00:55:36,000",We'll get Connor.
937,"00:55:36,083","00:55:37,625",Collin.
938,"00:55:37,708","00:55:39,750",Right.
939,"00:55:39,833","00:55:41,583","Oh, my God."
940,"00:55:41,666","00:55:44,416","I never should've let you guys
go out unsupervised."
941,"00:55:44,500","00:55:46,583","Uh, we were supervised."
942,"00:55:46,666","00:55:48,708","You were spying on us, remember?"
943,"00:55:48,791","00:55:51,083",Apparently not well enough.
944,"00:55:53,625","00:55:55,458",Maybe Bobbi's right.
945,"00:55:55,541","00:55:58,208",I'm losing my edge.
946,"00:55:58,291","00:56:00,166",What happened to it?
947,"00:56:04,541","00:56:08,583",I didn't want to be just that guy anymore.
948,"00:56:08,666","00:56:12,333",I wanted to be something... more.
949,"00:56:17,083","00:56:18,791",Here we go.
950,"00:56:20,125","00:56:22,833","\an8Oh, my God, he looks so scared."
951,"00:56:22,916","00:56:25,250","Okay, that's an industrial area
on the edge of the city."
952,"00:56:25,333","00:56:26,833",We can get there in 30 minutes.
953,"00:56:26,916","00:56:28,041",Let's roll.
954,"00:56:38,916","00:56:40,000",That's the location.
955,"00:56:40,083","00:56:41,434","Okay, boys,
we're out of sight."
956,"00:56:41,458","00:56:45,125","Uh, a few blocks away from you,
and satellite is up."
957,"00:56:45,208","00:56:46,392",Any activity visible?
958,"00:56:46,416","00:56:47,875",Negative.
959,"00:56:49,000","00:56:50,250",That's weird.
960,"00:56:51,791","00:56:54,416","No one's been in or out of there
in the last 24 hours."
961,"00:56:56,958","00:56:58,166",It's a trap.
962,"00:57:10,125","00:57:11,541","Oh, my God."
963,"00:57:28,916","00:57:31,041",Kim. Wake up.
964,"00:57:31,125","00:57:32,750",Kim!
965,"00:57:32,833","00:57:35,333",Where are we?
966,"00:57:37,958","00:57:39,833",I have no idea.
967,"00:57:41,291","00:57:43,750","I've totally messed this up, JJ."
968,"00:57:43,833","00:57:45,875",I put my son in great danger.
969,"00:57:47,625","00:57:49,541",I haven't done much better.
970,"00:57:50,833","00:57:53,291","Sophie's supposed to be having
the time of her life."
971,"00:57:53,375","00:57:57,250","Instead, she's trying to track us down
before we're brutally killed,"
972,"00:57:57,333","00:58:01,166","saddling her with a lifetime
of debilitating guilt"
973,"00:58:01,250","00:58:04,625","and unresolved daddy issues
that she'll work out on a pole."
974,"00:58:06,500","00:58:08,583",You're right. Yours is much worse.
975,"00:58:09,583","00:58:11,083",Jason Jones.
976,"00:58:11,166","00:58:12,625",It's been a minute.
977,"00:58:12,708","00:58:14,166",Crane.
978,"00:58:14,250","00:58:15,833",You son of a bitch.
979,"00:58:15,916","00:58:17,416",What have you done with my son?
980,"00:58:17,500","00:58:18,541",He's fine.
981,"00:58:18,625","00:58:19,916","But if I were you,"
982,"00:58:20,000","00:58:23,666",I'd be much more concerned about... you.
983,"00:58:26,125","00:58:27,791",Shoot.
984,"00:58:31,250","00:58:32,416",They're gone.
985,"00:58:32,500","00:58:33,916","Oh, my God, JJ."
986,"00:58:34,000","00:58:36,666",Ugh. Our trackers have been dumped.
987,"00:58:36,750","00:58:38,333",We're blind.
988,"00:58:39,583","00:58:41,416",Maybe not.
989,"00:58:41,500","00:58:43,208",I hacked JJ's phone in Venice.
990,"00:58:43,291","00:58:45,131","And I have advanced
satellite tracking on this."
991,"00:58:45,208","00:58:46,250",Okay.
992,"00:58:46,333","00:58:47,500",What's this about?
993,"00:58:49,166","00:58:50,916",Who are you working for?
994,"00:58:51,000","00:58:52,833",Patience.
995,"00:58:54,166","00:58:57,291","Looks like you've made
quite a life for yourself, JJ."
996,"00:58:59,541","00:59:02,333","Maybe I'll pay them a visit
after you're dead."
997,"00:59:02,416","00:59:04,250",Sophie's going to need a new daddy.
998,"00:59:10,125","00:59:12,958",Enough. Time for work.
999,"00:59:24,166","00:59:25,500",Nancy?
1000,"00:59:26,583","00:59:28,142","That's right, Jason Jones."
1001,"00:59:28,166","00:59:29,642","God, I love this thing."
1002,"00:59:29,666","00:59:31,875",Find Solo. I am Kylo Ren.
1003,"00:59:32,958","00:59:34,166",I don't understand.
1004,"00:59:34,250","00:59:36,208",When did you have time to color your hair?
1005,"00:59:37,291","00:59:40,125","I created a character
and infiltrated your world months ago."
1006,"00:59:40,208","00:59:42,791","That anonymous tip you got
on how to get the weapons cache?"
1007,"00:59:42,875","00:59:44,083",That was me.
1008,"00:59:44,166","00:59:48,083","I got you to use your own agent
to steal the locations of the nukes."
1009,"00:59:48,166","00:59:52,125","And then I paid off the choir board
and got your son to Europe."
1010,"00:59:52,208","00:59:56,000","And that was all it took to get you
to evade your own CIA detail,"
1011,"00:59:56,083","00:59:57,916",to come here and break into Aviano.
1012,"00:59:59,458","01:00:02,625","I've embedded myself
into every aspect of your lives."
1013,"01:00:02,708","01:00:04,583","So it was you who changed
all my passwords?"
1014,"01:00:04,666","01:00:07,500","I haven't been able
to watch DIRECTV for a month."
1015,"01:00:07,583","01:00:09,375",What? No.
1016,"01:00:09,458","01:00:10,625","No, you idiot."
1017,"01:00:10,708","01:00:12,108",That was probably a program update.
1018,"01:00:12,166","01:00:14,208","You need to use
a two-step verification process now."
1019,"01:00:14,291","01:00:15,666","Yeah, it's true."
1020,"01:00:15,750","01:00:17,390",I had to do that for all my Google stuff.
1021,"01:00:17,416","01:00:18,708",You done?
1022,"01:00:18,791","01:00:20,267","And God forbid you enter
your password wrong."
1023,"01:00:20,291","01:00:21,958",You can get locked out of your own phone.
1024,"01:00:22,041","01:00:24,458","It's facial recognition.
Hello, my face hasn't changed."
1025,"01:00:24,541","01:00:26,166","I mean... Okay, stopping."
1026,"01:00:27,458","01:00:29,250",I'm going to need those codes now.
1027,"01:00:29,333","01:00:30,375",Where's my son?
1028,"01:00:30,458","01:00:32,458",First things first.
1029,"01:00:32,541","01:00:33,625",Get him down.
1030,"01:00:33,708","01:00:35,083",Never! I...
1031,"01:00:35,166","01:00:37,208","Yeah. Oh, yes, get me down."
1032,"01:00:40,250","01:00:42,458",You can't give her those codes.
1033,"01:00:42,541","01:00:44,166","People will die, Kim."
1034,"01:00:44,250","01:00:46,208",I'm as good as my word. A deal's a deal.
1035,"01:00:48,041","01:00:49,875",It's my boy.
1036,"01:00:54,958","01:00:56,166",Thank you.
1037,"01:00:57,250","01:00:59,291",Put him in the car and get rid of the boy.
1038,"01:00:59,375","01:01:01,708",No. You gave me your word!
1039,"01:01:01,791","01:01:03,958",I'm not gonna kill him. Crane is.
1040,"01:01:04,041","01:01:06,250","The boy was just bait,
and now you're my insurance."
1041,"01:01:07,541","01:01:09,166","Don't do this, please!"
1042,"01:01:12,916","01:01:14,750",What are you really up to?
1043,"01:01:14,833","01:01:19,916","Let's just say this choir trip
has been very helpful."
1044,"01:01:20,000","01:01:21,000",What is that?
1045,"01:01:22,541","01:01:24,375",This is a powerful neurotoxin.
1046,"01:01:24,458","01:01:27,333","Every muscle in your body
will start to slowly seize up..."
1047,"01:01:27,416","01:01:29,500","including, finally, your diaphragm..."
1048,"01:01:29,583","01:01:31,125",whereupon...
1049,"01:01:34,708","01:01:36,541",...you will suffocate and die.
1050,"01:01:38,083","01:01:40,208","Enjoy the ride, Jason Jones."
1051,"01:02:18,166","01:02:19,791",There he is.
1052,"01:02:23,500","01:02:25,226","- He's barely breathing.
- Start compressions."
1053,"01:02:25,250","01:02:26,458",Okay.
1054,"01:02:26,541","01:02:29,750","One, two, three, four,"
1055,"01:02:29,833","01:02:33,041","five, six, seven, eight."
1056,"01:02:34,250","01:02:35,666",What are you doing?
1057,"01:02:35,750","01:02:37,875",It's atropine and adrenaline.
1058,"01:02:37,958","01:02:40,791","It'll keep his heart going
till his body can metabolize the toxin."
1059,"01:02:40,875","01:02:41,916","Well, hurry."
1060,"01:02:49,541","01:02:52,416",JJ!
1061,"01:02:52,500","01:02:54,750","Oh, I don't feel so good."
1062,"01:02:55,833","01:02:58,041",Is Bobbi okay?
1063,"01:02:58,125","01:02:59,916",That's a lot of vomit.
1064,"01:03:00,000","01:03:01,833","- She'll be fine.
- Okay."
1065,"01:03:01,916","01:03:03,625",Where's Mr. Kim?
1066,"01:03:03,708","01:03:05,458","Oh, no."
1067,"01:03:05,541","01:03:07,666","We've got to get to Collin
before Crane kills him."
1068,"01:03:07,750","01:03:10,291","- What? Oh, God.
- We got to go. We got to go."
1069,"01:03:10,375","01:03:12,166",Hey. Wake up.
1070,"01:03:12,250","01:03:13,250",Hey.
1071,"01:03:13,333","01:03:15,093","Stop. That's not the way
you wake someone up."
1072,"01:03:15,166","01:03:16,416",You have to say their name.
1073,"01:03:16,500","01:03:18,250","Bobbi, wake up."
1074,"01:03:18,333","01:03:20,750","Bobbi, wake up!"
1075,"01:03:20,833","01:03:22,375",Bobbi.
1076,"01:03:22,458","01:03:23,708","- Yes, yes.
- Bobbi."
1077,"01:03:23,791","01:03:24,976","- Help me.
- Let's go."
1078,"01:03:27,416","01:03:29,291","My arms and my legs
aren't working too good."
1079,"01:03:29,375","01:03:30,916","Yeah, and my face is killing me."
1080,"01:03:31,000","01:03:33,166","Did you see or hear anything
when you were dead?"
1081,"01:03:33,250","01:03:35,125",Just the sound of you barfing.
1082,"01:03:35,208","01:03:36,416",You're gonna have to drive.
1083,"01:03:36,500","01:03:39,291","I can't drive if I'm gonna hack
traffic cameras to find Crane."
1084,"01:03:39,375","01:03:40,541","Well, I can't drive."
1085,"01:03:40,625","01:03:42,166","- I can drive.
- Negative."
1086,"01:03:42,250","01:03:44,500","We don't have time
to argue about this, JJ."
1087,"01:03:44,583","01:03:47,083","- I'm taking driver's ed soon.
- Yeah, in two years."
1088,"01:03:47,166","01:03:50,208","You've let me steer.
You know I can do this."
1089,"01:03:52,750","01:03:54,625","Okay. Okay, go for it."
1090,"01:03:54,708","01:03:56,375",You'll be fine.
1091,"01:03:57,916","01:03:59,333","Punch it, Chewie."

1123,"01:08:18,583","01:08:20,250","- Other than Bobbi shooting me.
- Sorry."
1124,"01:08:20,333","01:08:21,791",I'm fine. Can you crack this?
1125,"01:08:21,875","01:08:23,375",Ugh. With my eyes closed.
1126,"01:08:23,458","01:08:25,000",Is that how you shoot?
1127,"01:08:25,083","01:08:27,375","Yeah, it's just so loud and scary."
1128,"01:08:31,333","01:08:32,958",Do you want me to do that?
1129,"01:08:33,041","01:08:35,208","You're doing a terrible job.
It's going to scar."
1130,"01:08:35,291","01:08:37,583","- I don't care how I look.
- I know."
1131,"01:08:40,333","01:08:43,166","- How can he just...
- Okay, let's not watch."
1132,"01:08:47,583","01:08:49,750",I don't believe it. Any of it.
1133,"01:08:49,833","01:08:52,875","I mean, why would they take my dad?
He's just a nurse."
1134,"01:08:54,458","01:08:57,250",JJ will find him. I promise.
1135,"01:08:59,916","01:09:03,041","Ever since my mom died,
my dad's been totally overprotective."
1136,"01:09:03,125","01:09:05,375","He makes me FaceTime him
anytime I go anywhere."
1137,"01:09:05,458","01:09:07,666","And if I don't answer,
he FaceTimes my friends."
1138,"01:09:07,750","01:09:10,083",I know what you mean.
1139,"01:09:10,166","01:09:12,291",JJ treats me like I'm still nine.
1140,"01:09:12,375","01:09:15,333","I mean, he still walks me
to school every day"
1141,"01:09:15,416","01:09:17,625",and tries to put me on his shoulders.
1142,"01:09:17,708","01:09:19,375",That's actually kind of cute.
1143,"01:09:19,458","01:09:24,166","Yeah, well, he's six-five, so one time,
I almost got decapitated by a ceiling fan."
1144,"01:09:26,875","01:09:29,791","The truth is, your dad is..."
1145,"01:09:29,875","01:09:31,875",just trying to be a good dad.
1146,"01:09:31,958","01:09:34,500","Maybe JJ is, too."
1147,"01:09:34,583","01:09:36,875","They just need to realize
we're not kids anymore."
1148,"01:09:38,500","01:09:40,333",Yeah.
1149,"01:09:40,416","01:09:42,041",We're not.
1150,"01:09:43,375","01:09:46,750","Collin, I have to level with you, okay?"
1151,"01:09:46,833","01:09:49,750","Your dad is the head of
covert operations for the CIA."
1152,"01:09:50,833","01:09:51,958",What?
1153,"01:09:52,041","01:09:56,541","And you're not going to believe this,
but Mrs. Buck is actually a terrorist."
1154,"01:09:56,625","01:09:58,875",Your dad traded himself in to save you.
1155,"01:10:01,000","01:10:02,416",Yeah.
1156,"01:10:02,500","01:10:04,750",It's for real.
1157,"01:10:04,833","01:10:06,333",How are you so calm?
1158,"01:10:07,666","01:10:09,000",I'm not.
1159,"01:10:12,000","01:10:13,916",Thanks for coming to save me.
1160,"01:10:15,625","01:10:17,458",You would've done the same for me.
1161,"01:10:48,666","01:10:50,250",Bring him.
1162,"01:11:14,250","01:11:16,125",It's somewhere here.
1163,"01:11:28,833","01:11:30,583",Break it open.
1164,"01:11:34,625","01:11:36,458",Who are you working for?
1165,"01:11:36,541","01:11:37,916",Let's just say
1166,"01:11:38,000","01:11:40,375","I represent a group
of very powerful people"
1167,"01:11:40,458","01:11:42,916","who had their fortune frozen
by your government"
1168,"01:11:43,000","01:11:44,666",and every one of its corrupt allies.
1169,"01:11:44,750","01:11:45,791",Oligarchs.
1170,"01:11:48,000","01:11:50,583",Friends. Patriots.
1171,"01:11:50,666","01:11:52,541",My husband was one of them.
1172,"01:11:52,625","01:11:55,083","Leaving him in financial ruin
drove him to his death."
1173,"01:11:55,166","01:11:57,646","Well, he was married to you,
so that may have also contributed."
1174,"01:11:58,833","01:12:02,583","I'm going to see to it we get back
all that is rightfully ours"
1175,"01:12:02,666","01:12:06,250","and make those righteous nations pay,
with a little interest."
1176,"01:12:19,083","01:12:20,708",Suitcase nuke.
1177,"01:12:20,791","01:12:23,708","Must have been hidden behind this wall
for over 60 years."
1178,"01:12:23,791","01:12:26,625","And thanks to you,
our ticket to our reparations."
1179,"01:12:26,708","01:12:29,416","- Why hide it in a church?
- Who would search a church?"
1180,"01:12:29,500","01:12:31,750","Plus, it wasn't necessarily intended
to go off here."
1181,"01:12:31,833","01:12:34,666","Just to be stored until the time
and moment was right."
1182,"01:12:34,750","01:12:36,791",You will never get away with this.
1183,"01:12:38,458","01:12:41,541","I've searched everything.
There's no clue of where they're headed"
1184,"01:12:41,625","01:12:43,545","- or what they're gonna strike.
- I'm in."
1185,"01:12:45,416","01:12:47,791","Ugh, to his dating profile."
1186,"01:12:47,875","01:12:49,208",It's not helpful.
1187,"01:12:49,291","01:12:51,250",It's actually really sad.
1188,"01:12:51,333","01:12:53,375","I'm gonna try and grab some sleep
on a real bed."
1189,"01:12:53,458","01:12:55,083","- Good night, guys.
- Good night, Collin."
1190,"01:12:55,166","01:12:56,458","Night, Collin."
1191,"01:12:56,541","01:12:58,458","- Hey.
- Hey."
1192,"01:12:58,541","01:13:00,208","You should try to get some rest, too."
1193,"01:13:00,291","01:13:01,750",Can't. I'm not tired.
1194,"01:13:03,250","01:13:04,916",Collin seems like a nice kid.
1195,"01:13:05,000","01:13:06,833","Yeah, he's great."
1196,"01:13:06,916","01:13:09,125","- You know you're torturing him, right?
- What?"
1197,"01:13:09,208","01:13:10,250",You can't tell?
1198,"01:13:10,333","01:13:12,166",He likes you.
1199,"01:13:12,250","01:13:14,208","I mean, like-likes you."
1200,"01:13:14,291","01:13:16,791",You're crazy. He's one of my best friends.
1201,"01:13:16,875","01:13:19,375","That's what all cute girls say
about guys they're torturing."
1202,"01:13:20,791","01:13:23,500","- Do you like him?
- Of course I like him."
1203,"01:13:23,583","01:13:25,958",But I like-like this kid named Ryan.
1204,"01:13:26,041","01:13:27,208",The jock?
1205,"01:13:27,291","01:13:28,333",Yeah.
1206,"01:13:30,041","01:13:32,625","For a highly trained operative,
you can be pretty blind."
1207,"01:13:32,708","01:13:34,375",I'm in.
1208,"01:13:34,458","01:13:36,125",For real this time.
1209,"01:13:36,208","01:13:38,958","I've got everything: emails, texts."
1210,"01:13:39,041","01:13:40,250",I also found this.
1211,"01:13:40,333","01:13:42,000",It's about how Nancy's husband died.
1212,"01:13:42,083","01:13:43,208",Whoa.
1213,"01:13:43,291","01:13:44,708","Hey, this is new."
1214,"01:13:45,791","01:13:48,666","From Nancy.
She sent this two hours ago."
1215,"01:13:48,750","01:13:50,750",What?
1216,"01:13:50,833","01:13:52,708",She's gonna detonate a WMD
1217,"01:13:52,791","01:13:55,291",under Rome's financial district.
1218,"01:13:57,500","01:14:01,000","We swept the sewers and ran into a signal
coming from behind a locked vault."
1219,"01:14:01,083","01:14:03,923","It looks like they're protecting
a central hub, just like you suggested."
1220,"01:14:03,958","01:14:06,078","- Have you breached it?
- Technical is setting up now."
1221,"01:14:40,958","01:14:42,375",We're clear.
1222,"01:14:42,458","01:14:44,250",Moving in.
1223,"01:14:51,916","01:14:54,416",There's nothing here. No WMD.
1224,"01:14:54,500","01:14:56,041",And look at this IED.
1225,"01:14:56,125","01:14:57,500",It's a fake.
1226,"01:15:00,541","01:15:01,833",I don't understand.
1227,"01:15:01,916","01:15:03,500",Seems like you got played.
1228,"01:15:03,583","01:15:05,875","We'd appreciate it
if you'll settle this game"
1229,"01:15:05,958","01:15:08,958","in your own time, not ours."
1230,"01:15:35,583","01:15:38,583","Agent Jones just called in a fake
bomb threat under the financial district."
1231,"01:15:38,666","01:15:40,333","- That makes no sense.
- No, it doesn't."
1232,"01:15:40,416","01:15:42,875","Maps, fake IEDs. I don't get it."
1233,"01:15:42,958","01:15:46,333","That email... could it have
been sent to mislead us?"
1234,"01:15:46,416","01:15:47,791",This was all a distraction.
1235,"01:15:47,875","01:15:50,541","Well, why would she need to distract us?
Where is she really?"
1236,"01:15:55,125","01:15:56,625",I think I know.
1237,"01:16:14,208","01:16:16,625","We have equipment
for the choir performance to unload."
1238,"01:16:17,708","01:16:20,500","You'll never get all the way in...
not with the G7 security."
1239,"01:16:20,583","01:16:24,666","Ordinarily, I'd say that you're right,
but I am not ordinary."
1240,"01:16:28,166","01:16:29,916",Prego.
1241,"01:16:30,000","01:16:36,125",♪ Softly and sweetly ♪
1242,"01:16:36,208","01:16:41,916",♪ Guide us into light ♪

1245,"01:16:51,916","01:16:54,666","Shouldn't we tell security
to clear the area?"
1246,"01:16:54,750","01:16:57,809","Police aren't gonna believe me anymore.
Pretty sure that was part of Nancy's plan."
1247,"01:16:57,833","01:16:59,713","This place is massive.
My dad could be anywhere."
1248,"01:16:59,791","01:17:01,291","Wait, your dad's phone..."
1249,"01:17:01,375","01:17:02,541",Crane destroyed it.
1250,"01:17:02,625","01:17:04,541",Did he carry a spare battery?
1251,"01:17:04,625","01:17:06,708","Always, for whenever he was ""on call."""
1252,"01:17:06,791","01:17:09,684","And all the phones issued at Langley have
E-tags on their batteries so they can be..."
1253,"01:17:09,708","01:17:10,791",Tracked.
1254,"01:17:10,875","01:17:14,416","Bobbi, can you look up Kim's phone records
and find his battery's tracking signal?"
1255,"01:17:14,500","01:17:17,791","Yes, but first, I'm gonna need
the Vatican's Wi-Fi password."
1256,"01:17:19,208","01:17:21,375","No, I'm not. I-I can do it.
What do you think it is?"
1257,"01:17:21,458","01:17:22,833","""Pope""? Probably."
1258,"01:17:22,916","01:17:24,500",He's so full of himself.
1259,"01:17:33,416","01:17:36,250",We've cleared the room. Good luck.
1260,"01:17:45,166","01:17:47,541","Yeah, sì, sì. He just came through here."
1261,"01:17:47,625","01:17:48,875",Thank you.
1262,"01:17:49,958","01:17:52,833","Langley just located
a battery signal from Kim."
1263,"01:17:55,333","01:17:58,750","Quite inspiring, isn't it?"
1264,"01:17:58,833","01:18:02,125","Some of the finest works of art
the world may never see,"
1265,"01:18:02,208","01:18:04,416",stuck here in storage.
1266,"01:18:04,500","01:18:08,291","Well, this is where your journey ends
and mine is just beginning."
1267,"01:18:12,000","01:18:15,200","This is a
message for the leaders of the free world."
1268,"01:18:15,250","01:18:17,083",There is a bomb under the Vatican.
1269,"01:18:17,166","01:18:20,333","And we will
detonate it if our demands are not met."
1270,"01:18:20,416","01:18:21,750",And if you try to leave...

1274,"01:18:33,583","01:18:36,875","Wire transfer details will be sent
after this message."
1275,"01:18:36,958","01:18:38,791",You have 30 minutes to comply.
1276,"01:18:38,875","01:18:41,750",We got to move POTUS now.
1277,"01:18:47,041","01:18:49,541","Okay, the signal's getting stronger."
1278,"01:18:51,416","01:18:53,750",Okay. This is as far as you two go.
1279,"01:18:53,833","01:18:54,916",What are you talking about?
1280,"01:18:55,000","01:18:57,142","- This is way too dangerous.
- But I can help. I..."
1281,"01:18:57,166","01:18:59,184","You guys need to get back
to the choir and warn them."
1282,"01:18:59,208","01:19:01,291","No, I'm not leaving here without you."
1283,"01:19:01,375","01:19:02,625",Hey.
1284,"01:19:02,708","01:19:05,948","It's been really great being on the same
team with you again the last couple days."
1285,"01:19:06,958","01:19:08,918","But I need you to let me
go at it alone from here."
1286,"01:19:09,000","01:19:10,833",Okay?
1287,"01:19:12,125","01:19:13,333",Okay.
1288,"01:19:14,416","01:19:15,791",Okay.
1289,"01:19:16,791","01:19:20,333","If we survive, the CIA better let us
write about this for our college apps."
1290,"01:19:20,416","01:19:22,250",Let's go.
1291,"01:19:33,875","01:19:35,833","You don't have to do this, Nancy."
1292,"01:19:35,916","01:19:37,500",What about all our children up there?
1293,"01:19:37,583","01:19:39,375",The choir has served its purpose.
1294,"01:19:41,500","01:19:43,708",They were just my Trojan horse.
1295,"01:19:43,791","01:19:45,666",How else could I get this close to the G7?
1296,"01:19:45,750","01:19:47,750",My God.

1299,"01:19:55,875","01:20:00,250","this holiest of places,
it was too perfect to pass up."
1300,"01:20:00,333","01:20:04,208","As long as those self-righteous men
will listen to reason and pay,"
1301,"01:20:04,291","01:20:06,791","no one needs to die, except for you."
1302,"01:20:06,875","01:20:11,333","Okay. You take down
the tough guys, I'll handle Nancy."
1303,"01:20:11,416","01:20:12,916","- You sure?
- Yeah."
1304,"01:20:13,000","01:20:14,791","She's a brain, not a fighter."
1305,"01:20:14,875","01:20:18,291","You can tell by the way she moves,
the way she carries herself,"
1306,"01:20:18,375","01:20:22,250","the way she surrounds herself with large,
attractive men to do her bidding."
1307,"01:20:24,166","01:20:28,000","Did you hear the part where I said
""large, attractive men to do her bidding""?"
1308,"01:20:28,083","01:20:29,500",That was meant for you.
1309,"01:20:30,791","01:20:32,625",Move.
1310,"01:20:34,666","01:20:36,250",Look what I found.
1311,"01:20:36,333","01:20:38,125","Oh, well, look who's back."
1312,"01:20:38,208","01:20:40,166","You just won't die, will you, JJ?"
1313,"01:20:40,250","01:20:42,958","Well, I find your story
fascinating, Nancy."
1314,"01:20:43,041","01:20:44,541",I'd really like to see how it ends.
1315,"01:20:44,625","01:20:45,875",It could end like this.
1316,"01:20:50,666","01:20:51,708",Ugh.
1317,"01:20:53,333","01:20:55,708","Come on, old man. Get up."
1318,"01:21:02,500","01:21:05,083","You fight a lot like
your friends from the platoon."
1319,"01:21:05,166","01:21:06,541",All cowards.
1320,"01:21:07,625","01:21:09,458",They begged me not to kill them.
1321,"01:21:09,541","01:21:11,041","Callahan, Bridges,"
1322,"01:21:11,125","01:21:12,833",even Christina.
1323,"01:21:12,916","01:21:14,708",Christina?
1324,"01:21:14,791","01:21:16,000",Yeah.
1325,"01:21:16,083","01:21:19,666","I planted a copy of the thumb drive
she stole in your home,"
1326,"01:21:19,750","01:21:21,791",along with the gun I used to kill her.
1327,"01:21:22,875","01:21:24,458","It's not a good look for you, JJ."
1328,"01:21:24,541","01:21:26,541",You were in my home?
1329,"01:21:26,625","01:21:30,083",I spared the dog 'cause I'm a dog guy.
1330,"01:21:30,166","01:21:33,041","Oh, and I watered your plants,
you know, 'cause I'm a plant guy."
1331,"01:21:34,375","01:21:36,208",But Blueberry...
1332,"01:21:37,625","01:21:39,375",...sleeps with the fishes.
1333,"01:21:50,166","01:21:51,375","Oh, shit."
1334,"01:21:51,458","01:21:53,416",And he should not have done that.
1335,"01:21:53,500","01:21:56,208","Forgive me, Lord,
for what I'm about to do."
1336,"01:22:06,916","01:22:08,666",Release the kraken.
1337,"01:22:20,250","01:22:23,208","Crane, if you could please stop moving,
I'd like to shoot JJ now..."
1338,"01:22:25,250","01:22:27,583",See? Totally handled.
1339,"01:22:30,875","01:22:32,416",Why? I'm already tied up.
1340,"01:22:41,125","01:22:42,375","Quick, cut me loose."
1341,"01:22:42,458","01:22:43,791","- I'm going after Nancy.

1346,"01:22:59,291","01:23:00,958","- Hey, where were you guys?

1347,"01:23:01,041","01:23:02,875",Where's Dr. Brookey?
1348,"01:23:02,958","01:23:05,750",Hey. I really missed you.
1349,"01:23:07,666","01:23:09,500","Ryan, seriously, okay?"
1350,"01:23:09,583","01:23:11,416",I really need to tell him something.
1351,"01:23:11,500","01:23:14,000","Okay? We have got to get out of here.
There's..."

1353,"01:23:26,208","01:23:28,208",I have Tasers on both of your backs.

1355,"01:23:33,041","01:23:35,125",Sophie?

1360,"01:23:43,750","01:23:45,541","When Bobbi threw the grenades,"
1361,"01:23:45,625","01:23:49,208","we ran back to our apartment
and dove into our new cast-iron tub."
1362,"01:23:49,291","01:23:53,458","If we went with Todd's idea
of white porcelain, we would be dead."
1363,"01:23:53,541","01:23:55,541",Hush.

1366,"01:24:18,125","01:24:19,666","Not fun, is it?"
1367,"01:24:37,291","01:24:38,625",He activated a kill switch.
1368,"01:24:38,708","01:24:41,416","We have two ways
to stop this bomb from going off."
1369,"01:24:41,500","01:24:43,958","Either I can figure out
how to deactivate it"
1370,"01:24:44,041","01:24:46,000","or we got to get
that kill switch from Crane."
1371,"01:24:46,083","01:24:48,000",On it.

1375,"01:25:46,958","01:25:48,833",We used to work for the cartel.
1376,"01:25:48,916","01:25:50,458",That's how we met Bishop Crane.
1377,"01:25:50,541","01:25:52,583","He asked if we'd freelance
on this little shindig."
1378,"01:25:52,666","01:25:56,000","We said no at first, but our trip to Cabo
got postponed because of the hurricane,"
1379,"01:25:56,083","01:26:00,416","and we're about to do a big reno,
so here we are."
1380,"01:26:00,500","01:26:03,583","You have to stop Nancy from doing this,
or we're all going to die."
1381,"01:26:03,666","01:26:06,083","- That is not gonna happen.
- Why not?"
1382,"01:26:06,166","01:26:09,750","She cray, but she's also smart."
1383,"01:26:09,833","01:26:11,916",Nancy won't let this end with a bang.
1384,"01:26:12,000","01:26:14,500","Well, at least not while she's still here."
1385,"01:26:14,583","01:26:16,166",Do you know her exact 20?
1386,"01:26:17,333","01:26:18,916",Hmm.
1387,"01:26:20,583","01:26:23,625","It's been nice
catching up with you, Sophie,"
1388,"01:26:23,708","01:26:27,375","but we have to end this little reunion
and get back to our post."
1389,"01:26:27,458","01:26:33,083","It's our job to make sure that
no one leaves before the show is over."
1390,"01:26:33,166","01:26:34,458",Like it is for you.
1391,"01:26:35,916","01:26:37,833",Get away from her.
1392,"01:26:37,916","01:26:40,458","Oh, isn't this cute?"
1393,"01:26:40,541","01:26:42,333",It's the nerds from Stranger Things.
1394,"01:26:43,458","01:26:45,208",I forgot my medicine.
1395,"01:26:46,291","01:26:49,125","Feel less guilty about killing him
in my dream."
1396,"01:26:49,208","01:26:51,642","Why don't you join your friend
and get the hell out of here"
1397,"01:26:51,666","01:26:53,041",before I kick your ass!

- Yeah, I didn't need to do that."
1401,"01:27:52,958","01:27:54,375",But thanks.
1402,"01:27:54,458","01:27:55,500",Sure. You were awesome.
1403,"01:27:55,583","01:27:57,500",Remind me to thank Ryan for all his help.
1404,"01:28:02,666","01:28:05,083",Come on. We've got to find JJ.
1405,"01:28:12,416","01:28:14,625","- What are you doing?
- Anything I can."
1406,"01:28:18,250","01:28:22,750","And now, from America, the children
from North Virginia High School."
1407,"01:28:49,875","01:28:51,666","Bobbi, where's JJ heading?"
1408,"01:28:51,750","01:28:52,833",Sophie?
1409,"01:28:52,916","01:28:54,666","He's chasing the dude
with the kill switch."
1410,"01:28:54,750","01:28:56,041","Let's pray that he finds him,"
1411,"01:28:56,125","01:28:58,416","'cause I cannot figure out
how to turn this thing off."
1412,"01:29:02,958","01:29:06,208","Tell them they have 23 minutes
to change their minds"
1413,"01:29:06,291","01:29:08,375",or else they'll learn the hard way.
1414,"01:29:08,458","01:29:10,541",I'll be at the heliport in ten.
1415,"01:29:30,375","01:29:31,750",Freeze!
1416,"01:29:31,833","01:29:35,458","Connelly, you don't understand."
1417,"01:29:35,541","01:29:37,000","What have you done, Chief?"
1418,"01:29:37,083","01:29:38,583",I'm not one of them.
1419,"01:29:38,666","01:29:41,000","If I were, you'd already be dead."
1420,"01:29:41,083","01:29:43,583",And you just let the real bad guy go.
1421,"01:29:43,666","01:29:45,041",What the hell is this all about?
1422,"01:29:45,125","01:29:46,725",How do we know you're telling the truth?
1423,"01:29:47,791","01:29:52,000","Connelly, who allowed you to use your
CIA credentials to spy on your ex-wife?"
1424,"01:29:52,083","01:29:54,083",You did.
1425,"01:29:54,166","01:29:57,041","And, Hargear, who kept it quiet
when at the Langley checkpoint"
1426,"01:29:57,125","01:29:59,500","security found something
vibrating in your bag?"
1427,"01:29:59,583","01:30:01,958","All right, I trust him."
1428,"01:30:02,041","01:30:03,541",It was a toy for my kid.
1429,"01:30:03,625","01:30:05,025",You don't have any kids.
1430,"01:30:05,083","01:30:08,208","Guys, we need to evacuate everyone now."
1431,"01:30:08,291","01:30:10,958","We tried, but they say
it's not a credible threat."
1432,"01:30:11,041","01:30:12,708","Bottom line, no one's leaving."
1433,"01:30:12,791","01:30:14,458",My God.
1434,"01:30:14,541","01:30:16,541","So, what do we do now?"
1435,"01:30:17,875","01:30:19,750",Put all our chips on JJ.

1492,"01:36:58,166","01:37:00,666",You don't have to apologize.
1493,"01:37:00,750","01:37:05,375","Been hard for me, emotionally,
just watching you grow up."
1494,"01:37:06,458","01:37:11,041","I didn't get to be a part
of your first nine years, and this part..."
1495,"01:37:11,125","01:37:13,333",it's just going too fast.
1496,"01:37:14,416","01:37:16,500",I know you can take care of yourself.
1497,"01:37:17,583","01:37:20,125",That's what makes me a little sad.
1498,"01:37:20,208","01:37:22,500",I really like taking care of you.
1499,"01:37:22,583","01:37:25,000","I'm just dreading the day
you don't need me anymore."
1500,"01:37:26,500","01:37:28,250","Well, you have at least a week."
1501,"01:37:30,166","01:37:32,708",I think you're right about Collin.
1502,"01:37:32,791","01:37:35,791","I didn't see it at first, but thanks."
1503,"01:37:37,541","01:37:42,791","So, what I'm sensing here is,
basically, you've said I'm right."
1504,"01:37:42,875","01:37:44,000",Twice.
1505,"01:37:45,083","01:37:46,250",Don't get cocky.
1506,"01:37:46,333","01:37:48,583",Mr. Jones.
1507,"01:37:48,666","01:37:51,083","We need to take you to the hospital
for some observations."
1508,"01:37:51,166","01:37:52,333",Okay.
1509,"01:37:53,416","01:37:54,541",Can I come with him?
1510,"01:37:54,625","01:37:56,541","Uh, I'm sorry, miss. Are you family?"
1511,"01:38:00,458","01:38:02,250",He's my dad.
1512,"01:38:06,291","01:38:07,875",Of course.
1513,"01:38:22,000","01:38:24,166",This is so weird.
1514,"01:38:24,250","01:38:26,125",I dreamed it would be a view like this
1515,"01:38:26,208","01:38:29,083","where I'd be standing here
with Ryan on this trip."
1516,"01:38:29,166","01:38:31,166",Maybe even have my first kiss.
1517,"01:38:31,250","01:38:33,625","I'm sorry it didn't work out
the way you wanted."
1518,"01:38:34,875","01:38:37,166",I'm not.
1519,"01:38:37,250","01:38:40,625","It's the right view,
but I had the wrong person."
1520,"01:38:45,916","01:38:49,375","Do you maybe want to go
to the homecoming dance with me?"
1521,"01:38:50,458","01:38:52,541",Yeah. That'd be nice.
1522,"01:38:59,958","01:39:01,458",Whoa.
1523,"01:39:01,541","01:39:03,250",Do you think JJ's watching us somewhere?
1524,"01:39:03,333","01:39:05,291",Probably.
1525,"01:39:22,583","01:39:25,291","Oh, for the love of Pete, are you crying?"
1526,"01:39:25,375","01:39:27,083",I'm not crying.
1527,"01:39:27,166","01:39:29,166","- You're crying.
- You cried first."
1528,"01:39:29,250","01:39:31,250","How much is this satellite
costing the CIA, anyway?"
1529,"01:39:31,291","01:39:34,041",You don't want to know.
1530,"01:39:36,541","01:39:37,916","Hey, what are you doing?"
1531,"01:39:38,000","01:39:40,333",I'm giving them some space.
1532,"01:39:41,541","01:39:43,541",All right. Fine.
1533,"01:39:43,625","01:39:46,000","Hey. You know, you and I
could end up being family someday."
1534,"01:39:46,083","01:39:48,625","Hey. This was a nice moment.
Let's not ruin it, okay?"
1535,"01:39:48,708","01:39:51,458","Speaking of new family,
when we get back..."
1536,"01:39:52,750","01:39:54,550","...I'm gonna make
a lot of changes in my life."
1537,"01:39:55,750","01:39:57,416",Mm...
1538,"01:39:58,500","01:40:01,833",Yep. A lot of changes.
1539,"01:40:01,916","01:40:03,708","Isn't that right,
my little cleaner shrimp?"
1540,"01:40:03,791","01:40:04,916",Mm...
1541,"01:40:06,666","01:40:08,458",Holy shit.
