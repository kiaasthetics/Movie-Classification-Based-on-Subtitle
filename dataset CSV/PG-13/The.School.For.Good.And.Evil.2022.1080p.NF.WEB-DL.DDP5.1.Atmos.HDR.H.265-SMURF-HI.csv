2155,"01:38:07,791","01:38:10,458","Yes, they locked her in
because she broke the rules."
2156,"01:38:10,541","01:38:11,833",You both did.
2157,"01:38:11,916","01:38:15,083",Why? Why did you help her in the trial?
2158,"01:38:15,166","01:38:17,250","Did you not think
she could do it on her own?"
2159,"01:38:17,333","01:38:21,916","I thought that you believed
that Sophie was truly Good."
2160,"01:38:22,541","01:38:23,583",I don't.
2161,"01:38:23,666","01:38:27,166","I don't believe that anyone
is truly Good or truly Evil,"
2162,"01:38:27,250","01:38:29,250","because people are complicated,"

2165,"01:38:32,625","01:38:35,833","- The rules of this school must be...
- Must be obeyed."
2166,"01:38:35,916","01:38:39,791","You keep saying that,
but what good are your rules"
2167,"01:38:39,875","01:38:43,250","if you don't do anything about it
when actual, dangerous Evil is here?"
2168,"01:38:43,333","01:38:44,458",Please!
2169,"01:38:44,541","01:38:48,375","Sophie is many, many things,
but I would hardly call her dangerous."
2170,"01:38:48,458","01:38:50,000",Not Sophie. Rafal!

2173,"01:38:55,041","01:38:57,416","Rafal. I saw him again in the forest,"
2174,"01:38:57,500","01:38:59,500","but clearly, none of you
have done anything about it."
2175,"01:38:59,583","01:39:03,000","""Again""? spluttering
What does that mean?"
2176,"01:39:03,083","01:39:05,750",Have you seen Rafal before? Here?
2177,"01:39:05,833","01:39:06,958",Yeah.
2178,"01:39:07,041","01:39:09,750","In the tower of blood
I told the School Master about."
2179,"01:39:09,833","01:39:11,750",And Sophie saw him in her classroom.
2180,"01:39:11,833","01:39:14,833",So did Lady Lesso. Didn't she tell you?
2181,"01:39:14,916","01:39:16,875",sighs Lesso.

2190,"01:39:39,583","01:39:42,208",I hope you feel better soon.
2191,"01:39:45,083","01:39:48,708","Agatha Dear Sophie, I'm so sorry
for what happened in the forest."
2192,"01:39:48,791","01:39:50,583",I never meant to hurt you.
2193,"01:39:50,666","01:39:51,791","But whatever's going on,"
2194,"01:39:51,875","01:39:54,291","it's more than you getting a kiss
from a prince."
2195,"01:39:54,375","01:39:56,583",I saw Rafal in the woods.
2196,"01:39:56,666","01:40:00,083","I think what's happening here
is bigger than anyone realizes."
2197,"01:40:00,166","01:40:03,041","It's true Evil,
and we have to stick together."
2198,"01:40:03,125","01:40:05,500","- Sophie sighs

2203,"01:40:14,625","01:40:17,000","Rafal Don't tell me
you actually believe that."
2204,"01:40:18,000","01:40:19,000",It's a lie.

2206,"01:40:20,666","01:40:23,625","And besides, that prince
wasn't good enough for you anyway."

2208,"01:40:25,875","01:40:29,000","- But I thought...
- Rafal I'd left you? Never."
2209,"01:40:29,583","01:40:32,458",Even if everyone else has betrayed you.

from the very beginning."
2216,"01:40:53,000","01:40:57,208","She means to drag you
back to that miserable little village."
2217,"01:40:59,291","01:41:00,750",But I'll protect you.
2218,"01:41:01,500","01:41:03,125",I'll help you.

2224,"01:41:17,541","01:41:21,958","you'll emerge more beautiful
and more powerful than ever."

2237,"01:41:59,291","01:42:04,125","You knew Rafal was here,
in the school, and you told no one?"
2238,"01:42:04,208","01:42:07,041","Ah, must have slipped my mind."
2239,"01:42:07,125","01:42:12,458","I see! The soul of wickedness itself
just slipped your mind, Lesso?"
2240,"01:42:12,541","01:42:15,791",I'm the Dean of the School for Evil.
2241,"01:42:15,875","01:42:17,750",Does that suggest anything to you?
2242,"01:42:17,833","01:42:19,833","Yeah, it suggests
that nobody in charge here knows"
2243,"01:42:19,916","01:42:21,375",what's going on in this stupid place.
2244,"01:42:21,458","01:42:24,083","- Quiet, Reader!
- Or what? You'll fail me for frowning?"
2245,"01:42:24,166","01:42:26,125","Now, what does Rafal want with Sophie?"
2246,"01:42:26,208","01:42:28,625",For Evil to finally win!
2247,"01:42:29,375","01:42:30,208",That's what.
2248,"01:42:30,291","01:42:31,958",That's what you think will happen?
2249,"01:42:32,041","01:42:34,000",Rafal won't help Evil win.
2250,"01:42:34,083","01:42:37,291","When he tried to kill the School Master,
his own brother,"
2251,"01:42:37,375","01:42:40,375","his goal was to destroy the school,
both schools,"
2252,"01:42:40,458","01:42:43,041","so that he can keep
all the magic in the world to himself."
2253,"01:42:43,125","01:42:46,333","Thank you so much, beauty teacher."
2254,"01:42:46,416","01:42:50,666","Hey, I was the head
of the Magical History Department"
2255,"01:42:50,750","01:42:52,458","long before you got here, Red."
2256,"01:42:52,541","01:42:54,125","- You were?
- Yes!"
2257,"01:42:54,208","01:42:56,416","Before this place
became insufferably shallow"
2258,"01:42:56,500","01:42:58,750",and I was demoted to beautification.
2259,"01:42:58,833","01:43:01,333","Do I look like I give a shit
about smiling?"
2260,"01:43:01,416","01:43:03,250","Okay, then we have to protect Sophie."
2261,"01:43:03,333","01:43:05,458","- And we will, as soon as we find her.
- Dovey gasps"
2262,"01:43:05,541","01:43:06,958",Sophie is missing.
2263,"01:43:07,958","01:43:09,375","- And Anemone is right.
- Oh."
2264,"01:43:09,458","01:43:13,083","Rafal will destroy this entire school
if he joins forces with Sophie."
2265,"01:43:13,166","01:43:14,000",Lies.
2266,"01:43:14,083","01:43:16,125",All lies!
2267,"01:43:16,208","01:43:18,750","This is just another ploy
to have Good win again."
2268,"01:43:18,833","01:43:20,000","Trust me, it's not."
2269,"01:43:20,708","01:43:23,166","If my brother is back from the dead,"
2270,"01:43:23,250","01:43:27,708","there is a good chance
none of us will survive, Lady Lesso."
2271,"01:43:27,791","01:43:29,083",None of us.
2272,"01:43:29,166","01:43:31,416",Go find Sophie now. Search both schools.
2273,"01:43:31,500","01:43:32,916","Yes, of course."
2274,"01:43:34,583","01:43:35,875",And Agatha.
2275,"01:43:37,583","01:43:38,625",Go to the Evers Ball.
2276,"01:43:38,708","01:43:42,875","Sophie may very well show there.
If she does, bring her to me."
2277,"01:43:43,916","01:43:44,958","Now, go."

to burning me and my mom."
2329,"01:46:47,750","01:46:49,833","And the whole village just laughs,"

2331,"01:46:53,750","01:46:57,041","She's the only one who has stood up for me
from the time we were kids."
2332,"01:46:57,125","01:46:58,666","She's like my sister,"
2333,"01:46:58,750","01:47:00,916","and I'm not someone
who gives up on family."
2334,"01:47:02,250","01:47:03,250",Not ever.

anything like that for me before."
2340,"01:47:16,250","01:47:18,583",And it made me realize
