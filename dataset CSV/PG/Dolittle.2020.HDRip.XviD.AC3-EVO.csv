a peculiar doctor,"

extraordinary ability."
4,"00:01:00,438","00:01:03,472",He could talk to animals.
5,"00:01:04,944","00:01:07,845","Dr. Dolittle's reputation
spread far and wide."
6,"00:01:07,847","00:01:10,680",Even the queen of England called on him.
7,"00:01:10,682","00:01:13,482","So grateful for his help,"
8,"00:01:13,484","00:01:15,719","she gifted him
a wondrous sanctuary,"
9,"00:01:15,721","00:01:19,656","whose doors were open
to all creatures."
10,"00:01:19,658","00:01:21,725","His days belonged
to the animals,"
11,"00:01:21,727","00:01:26,029","but his heart belonged
to one woman:"
12,"00:01:26,031","00:01:29,967","Lily, the fearless explorer."
13,"00:01:29,969","00:01:34,504","They traveled the globe
going on great adventures,"
14,"00:01:34,506","00:01:38,477","defending creatures who could
not defend themselves."
15,"00:01:43,749","00:01:47,551","They made
an extraordinary team."
16,"00:01:47,553","00:01:50,589","Soon, that team
became a family."
17,"00:01:52,758","00:01:55,059","With Lily by his side,"
18,"00:01:55,061","00:01:58,629","Dolittle never felt more alive,"
19,"00:01:58,631","00:02:02,702","until one day,
she left on an adventure."
20,"00:02:10,644","00:02:13,546",Lily died at sea.
21,"00:02:17,617","00:02:20,818","Heartbroken, he locked
the gates of the manor"
22,"00:02:20,820","00:02:23,955","and completely retreated
from the world."
23,"00:02:23,957","00:02:28,493","As for me and the animals
whose lives he'd saved,"
24,"00:02:28,495","00:02:32,899","we were left to wonder...
could anyone save his?"
25,"00:02:36,703","00:02:39,972","Until one morning,
a most unlikely creature"
26,"00:02:39,974","00:02:42,707","found its way
into Dolittle's life."
27,"00:02:42,709","00:02:45,576",A very special boy.
28,"00:02:45,578","00:02:47,612","In a time where people
thought of animals"
29,"00:02:47,614","00:02:50,950","only as possessions,
food or sport,"
30,"00:02:50,952","00:02:53,819","this boy felt
quite differently."
31,"00:03:02,663","00:03:05,130","This way,
me scattered squirrel."
32,"00:03:05,132","00:03:07,300",Right.
33,"00:03:07,302","00:03:08,867",Junior flushes 'em.
34,"00:03:08,869","00:03:10,602",You shoot 'em. Yeah?
35,"00:03:10,604","00:03:11,804","Right. Good plan, Dad."
36,"00:03:11,806","00:03:13,105",Get ready.
37,"00:03:13,107","00:03:15,574","- Shoulder your gun.
- Do I have to, Uncle?"
38,"00:03:15,576","00:03:17,009","Come on, boy."
39,"00:03:17,011","00:03:18,711",Duck!
40,"00:03:18,713","00:03:20,579","Duck! Duck, duck!"
41,"00:03:20,581","00:03:22,881","- Duck! Duck!
- There, there they go."
42,"00:03:22,883","00:03:24,683","Shoot, shoot, shoot.
You got him. You got him."
43,"00:03:24,685","00:03:25,684","You got him.
Shoot, shoot, shoot."
44,"00:03:25,686","00:03:27,954","- Oh, oh, no, I can't.
- Shoot, shoot, shoot!"
45,"00:03:32,127","00:03:33,827","You can't keep
missing on purpose."
46,"00:03:33,829","00:03:35,028","Oh, look."
47,"00:03:35,030","00:03:36,963",He hit something this time.
48,"00:03:43,138","00:03:45,171","Oh, no."
49,"00:03:45,173","00:03:47,040",We have to help him.
50,"00:03:47,042","00:03:48,908",Aye.
51,"00:03:48,910","00:03:50,610","We never leave
an animal suffering."
52,"00:03:50,612","00:03:51,911",Not on our error.
53,"00:03:51,913","00:03:53,015",Here you go.
54,"00:04:00,789","00:04:03,058",He's a very odd boy.
55,"00:04:14,370","00:04:15,804",Follow Poly.
56,"00:04:31,654","00:04:34,388","""Home of Dr. John
and Lily Dolittle."
57,"00:04:34,390","00:04:35,990","We treat all animals."""
58,"00:04:45,835","00:04:47,168",Ah-ah.
59,"00:04:47,170","00:04:48,305",Follow Poly.
60,"00:04:53,709","00:04:55,709",Secret entrance.
61,"00:05:37,288","00:05:39,788",P-Poly? Where'd you go?
62,"00:05:54,973","00:05:57,006",Good... good... good dog.
63,"00:05:57,008","00:06:00,143","Big, hairy..."
64,"00:07:59,899","00:08:01,233",It's not good.
65,"00:08:01,235","00:08:05,137","As far as I'm concerned,
I'm the only human here."
66,"00:08:05,139","00:08:06,605",Just ignore them.
67,"00:08:06,607","00:08:08,374","There's no getting past
a Kalahari snare, Doc."
68,"00:08:08,376","00:08:09,907",It's an ingenious design.
69,"00:08:09,909","00:08:11,909","I think you just
caught yourself a boy."
70,"00:08:11,911","00:08:13,279","Let me see.
Wait, I don't want to see."
71,"00:08:13,281","00:08:14,913",Just make it go away.
72,"00:08:14,915","00:08:17,049","Deep breaths, Doc.
Dab-Dab's got your back."
73,"00:08:17,051","00:08:18,317","Don't be afraid, John."
74,"00:08:18,319","00:08:19,918",It's just a boy.
75,"00:08:19,920","00:08:21,453",This is an opportunity.
76,"00:08:21,455","00:08:24,456","Oh, this is a nightmare!"
77,"00:08:26,093","00:08:27,928","- Oh, come on.
- Pardon me."
78,"00:08:30,031","00:08:32,133","Whatever are you
doing up there?"
79,"00:08:33,334","00:08:35,067","I've come from
Buckingham Palace"
80,"00:08:35,069","00:08:36,869",on urgent business.
81,"00:08:36,871","00:08:40,205","Can you tell me if this is
the home of John Dolittle?"
82,"00:08:40,207","00:08:42,309",Who are you?
83,"00:08:42,311","00:08:44,209",You may call me Lady Rose.
84,"00:08:44,211","00:08:46,212",And you are?
85,"00:08:46,214","00:08:48,047",Stubbins.
86,"00:08:48,049","00:08:51,284",Could you help me down?
87,"00:08:51,286","00:08:53,320","This goes against
Dolittle's rules."
88,"00:08:53,322","00:08:55,954","Why are humans
against the rules again?"
89,"00:08:55,956","00:08:57,424","If you let humans too close,
you'll get hurt"
90,"00:08:57,426","00:08:59,492","more than you would if
you didn't let them in at all."
91,"00:08:59,494","00:09:00,960","Isn't that right, Doc?"
92,"00:09:00,962","00:09:02,128","That's enough, everybody."
93,"00:09:02,130","00:09:03,363",Back to our routine.
94,"00:09:03,365","00:09:05,098","- We have a very full day.
- John!"
95,"00:09:05,100","00:09:07,033",Pull yourself together.
96,"00:09:07,035","00:09:09,235","You can't ignore people
just because they're..."
97,"00:09:09,237","00:09:10,670",people.
98,"00:09:10,672","00:09:12,673",What if they need help?
99,"00:09:14,276","00:09:16,376",Possum. Play dead.
100,"00:09:16,378","00:09:18,978",This is ridiculous.
101,"00:09:18,980","00:09:20,313","Chee-Chee,
will you answer the door?"
102,"00:09:20,315","00:09:22,148",You're the only one with arms.
103,"00:09:22,150","00:09:24,384","I think chess was
enough pressure for one day."
104,"00:09:24,386","00:09:25,486","Chee-Chee, boy,"
105,"00:09:25,488","00:09:27,187",this is what we trained for.
106,"00:09:27,189","00:09:29,490",Be brave and get rid of 'em.
107,"00:09:29,492","00:09:31,392",And don't forget your mantra.
108,"00:09:31,394","00:09:34,528",I am not a prisoner of fear?
109,"00:09:34,530","00:09:37,264",You are not a prisoner of fear.
110,"00:09:39,968","00:09:41,435",Have you been here before?
111,"00:09:41,437","00:09:43,371","The queen's told me
all about it."
112,"00:09:43,373","00:09:45,706",It's a most unusual place.
113,"00:09:45,708","00:09:47,276",I'm prepared for anything.
114,"00:09:57,553","00:09:59,153",Wonderful.
115,"00:09:59,155","00:10:01,088",A gorilla answering the door.
116,"00:10:01,090","00:10:03,991",Just as the queen said.
117,"00:10:09,298","00:10:12,233","Oh, wait a minute."
118,"00:10:12,235","00:10:14,438",I have an injured squirrel.
119,"00:10:21,311","00:10:24,947",I should never have let you go.
120,"00:10:43,000","00:10:44,099",Hello?
121,"00:11:04,288","00:11:06,622","Oh, look at you."
122,"00:11:06,624","00:11:10,460","Aren't you peculiar
posing as a twig?"
123,"00:11:10,462","00:11:12,361","Move, please."
124,"00:11:12,363","00:11:13,629",This is my hiding spot.
125,"00:11:19,304","00:11:20,369",Not here.
126,"00:11:21,539","00:11:24,106",Are you all right down there?
127,"00:11:24,108","00:11:25,541",Yeah. Fine.
128,"00:11:25,543","00:11:27,410","- Go on.
- Dr. Dolittle?"
129,"00:11:27,412","00:11:30,046","- Yeah, right.
- You have been summoned"
130,"00:11:30,048","00:11:33,115","to Buckingham Palace
by the queen herself."
131,"00:11:33,117","00:11:34,450",Hoo-ha.
132,"00:11:34,452","00:11:36,052",Go on.
133,"00:11:36,054","00:11:39,522","You should know,
she's fallen gravely ill."
134,"00:11:42,060","00:11:44,126","Do you understand
what I'm saying?"
135,"00:11:44,128","00:11:46,395","Do you understand what
I'm saying?"
136,"00:11:46,397","00:11:48,465",Go... on.
137,"00:11:48,467","00:11:50,567",Go on and be gone!
138,"00:11:50,569","00:11:53,570","I don't care about anyone,
anything, anywhere anymore."
139,"00:11:55,073","00:11:57,208",The birds will show you out.
140,"00:11:59,278","00:12:01,143","Right, everything's tidy."
141,"00:12:01,145","00:12:03,247",Lunch will be served in a minute now.
142,"00:12:09,555","00:12:10,687",Mmm!
143,"00:12:10,689","00:12:12,589","Smells lovely, Doc."
144,"00:12:12,591","00:12:14,157",Thanks very much.
145,"00:12:14,159","00:12:16,462","Hey, Doc, save some
for us this time."
146,"00:12:20,432","00:12:22,699","Sorry, Doc.
Guess I'm scared of kids, too."
147,"00:12:22,701","00:12:25,269","Don't worry about that.
Come on, let's eat."
148,"00:12:25,271","00:12:27,705","I'm going to be offering today
a brothy soup."
149,"00:12:27,707","00:12:30,374","You'll never believe
what we caught in the net."
150,"00:12:30,376","00:12:32,342","The queen has asked for you
by name, sir."
151,"00:12:32,344","00:12:33,678",Are you hard of hearing?
152,"00:12:33,680","00:12:35,580","I told you,
I'm closed for business."
153,"00:12:40,152","00:12:42,252",What business?
154,"00:12:42,254","00:12:44,187",Treating humans.
155,"00:12:47,327","00:12:48,893",Intruder alert.
156,"00:12:51,731","00:12:53,498",Don't worry. I'm fine.
157,"00:12:53,500","00:12:55,366","Well, I'm not."
158,"00:12:55,368","00:12:57,168","My house is descending
into chaos."
159,"00:12:57,170","00:12:58,603",I-Is he yours?
160,"00:12:58,605","00:13:01,339",I don't own anybody.
161,"00:13:01,341","00:13:03,741","Yoshi had an issue
that he came to me with."
162,"00:13:05,579","00:13:08,212",He's always cold.
163,"00:13:08,214","00:13:10,350",I have an injured squirrel.
164,"00:13:11,418","00:13:13,318",I don't know what to do.
165,"00:13:13,320","00:13:15,088",How was he injured?
166,"00:13:16,189","00:13:17,623",I...
167,"00:13:17,625","00:13:19,357",I-I shot him.
168,"00:13:19,359","00:13:21,192",What? I can't hear you.
169,"00:13:21,194","00:13:23,361","I shot him,
but it was an accident."
170,"00:13:23,363","00:13:26,230","Of course,
an accidental firing upon."
171,"00:13:26,232","00:13:28,534",Humans never change.
172,"00:13:28,536","00:13:31,403",He's very hurt.
173,"00:13:31,405","00:13:33,708",Please help him.
174,"00:13:42,617","00:13:44,516",Take that.
175,"00:13:44,518","00:13:46,387",And this.
176,"00:13:51,792","00:13:53,325",I...
177,"00:13:53,327","00:13:55,795",I... I...
178,"00:13:55,797","00:13:58,499",I'm too beautiful to die.
179,"00:14:03,705","00:14:05,506",Oh.
180,"00:14:15,817","00:14:17,684",Yes?
181,"00:14:17,686","00:14:19,786",He's with us.
182,"00:14:19,788","00:14:23,823","Dab-Dab, Jip, light the lamps
and disinfect the surgery."
183,"00:14:23,825","00:14:25,492",You will not tend to a squirrel
184,"00:14:25,494","00:14:27,761","while the queen of England's
life hangs in the balance."
185,"00:14:27,763","00:14:30,363","Oh, you don't know me
very well, do you?"
186,"00:14:30,365","00:14:31,631",Don't drop him.
187,"00:14:31,633","00:14:33,000",We got a code red.
188,"00:14:33,002","00:14:34,503","Code red, code red, everybody."
189,"00:14:35,771","00:14:38,005",The doctor is back!
190,"00:14:39,508","00:14:41,008","Hang on, little buddy."
191,"00:14:41,010","00:14:43,010","Whew!
I haven't done this in a while."
192,"00:14:43,012","00:14:45,280","Let's get everything
the way Doc likes it."
193,"00:14:46,682","00:14:48,583","Don't worry. We got you, pal."
194,"00:14:56,324","00:14:58,494","Righto. Let's save
this squirrel, shall we?"
195,"00:14:59,595","00:15:01,361",Okay.
196,"00:15:01,363","00:15:03,631","When you wake up,
everything will be fine."
197,"00:15:03,633","00:15:05,466","If I die, I swear
I will haunt your house."
198,"00:15:05,468","00:15:06,667",Sterilize the scalpels.
199,"00:15:06,669","00:15:08,269",Do not lick any instruments.
200,"00:15:08,271","00:15:09,637","Patient's condition
has stabilized."
201,"00:15:11,507","00:15:14,775","They're understanding him,
and he's understanding them,"
202,"00:15:14,777","00:15:16,744",in their own languages.
203,"00:15:21,818","00:15:24,618","Going through the left
ventricle... it's brilliant."
204,"00:15:24,620","00:15:26,054",Wow.
205,"00:15:26,056","00:15:27,621","Dab-Dab, forceps, please."
206,"00:15:27,623","00:15:28,789",Here you go.
207,"00:15:28,791","00:15:30,491",That's a piece of celery.
208,"00:15:30,493","00:15:31,625","Forceps, Dab-Dab."
209,"00:15:31,627","00:15:33,494","Oh, sorry. Here you go."
210,"00:15:33,496","00:15:34,763",Still celery.
211,"00:15:34,765","00:15:35,797",Forceps?
212,"00:15:35,799","00:15:37,631","- Carrot, that is.
- Forceps?"
213,"00:15:37,633","00:15:39,366","That's a different piece
of celery."
214,"00:15:39,368","00:15:40,367",Got it. Forceps.
215,"00:15:40,369","00:15:41,636","No, still celery."
216,"00:15:41,638","00:15:43,872",Never mind. I'll get it myself.
217,"00:15:43,874","00:15:46,777","I want to know how to talk
to the animals."
218,"00:15:47,878","00:15:50,545","Chee-Chee, brow."
219,"00:15:50,547","00:15:52,748","My brow as well,
when you've got a second."
220,"00:15:52,750","00:15:54,516",Right. Sorry.
221,"00:15:54,518","00:15:58,086","I'm going to come here
and be Dolittle's apprentice."
222,"00:15:58,088","00:16:01,358","Her Majesty has designated
this land a nature preserve."
223,"00:16:02,426","00:16:03,625","If she dies,"
224,"00:16:03,627","00:16:06,495","the deed will be owned
by the Treasury,"
225,"00:16:06,497","00:16:08,665",and this place goes away.
226,"00:16:09,767","00:16:11,566","- Shut down?
- Mm-hmm."
227,"00:16:11,568","00:16:12,870",There you are.
228,"00:16:14,404","00:16:15,570","Whoo, still got it, Doc."
229,"00:16:15,572","00:16:17,339","Oh, wow."
230,"00:16:17,341","00:16:18,875",Ah.
231,"00:16:18,877","00:16:20,408","There, Cheech."
232,"00:16:20,410","00:16:21,911",That's the spot.
233,"00:16:21,913","00:16:24,412","Keep an eye on Kevin, shall we?"
234,"00:16:24,414","00:16:26,916","He may be prickly
when the anesthetic wears off."
235,"00:16:31,890","00:16:34,457",Revenge.
236,"00:16:34,459","00:16:36,391","Okay, okay."
237,"00:16:36,393","00:16:38,394",Enough with the pampering.
238,"00:16:38,396","00:16:40,963","You need to go
and help the queen."
239,"00:16:40,965","00:16:44,534","There are things
I no longer do:"
240,"00:16:44,536","00:16:46,836","work with humans
or leave the house."
241,"00:16:46,838","00:16:48,838","- Or bathe.
- Oh, exercise."
242,"00:16:48,840","00:16:53,576","Express emotional
vulnerability."
243,"00:16:53,578","00:16:54,977","Wake up, John."
244,"00:16:54,979","00:16:57,413","If the queen dies,
the Treasury takes the deed,"
245,"00:16:57,415","00:16:59,582",and we'd lose this house.
246,"00:16:59,584","00:17:02,485","You're talking out of
your tail feathers, Poly."
247,"00:17:02,487","00:17:04,453",The deed was for life.
248,"00:17:04,455","00:17:07,623","The last time I checked,
I was very much alive."
249,"00:17:07,625","00:17:09,661","The queen's life, John,
not yours."
250,"00:17:10,729","00:17:11,995",Look at that.
251,"00:17:11,997","00:17:14,597",It just rolls off my back.
252,"00:17:14,599","00:17:17,601","I knew I shouldn't have let
monkeys proofread the contract."
253,"00:17:17,603","00:17:20,537","Elliot, Elsie, you are fired!"
254,"00:17:22,541","00:17:24,942","It gets worse. We'll be
thrown out of these gates"
255,"00:17:24,944","00:17:27,010","right in the middle
of hunting season!"
256,"00:17:27,012","00:17:28,512","- What?
- No, no, no."
257,"00:17:28,514","00:17:29,780","Breathe, Chee-Chee."
258,"00:17:29,782","00:17:31,648","We get kicked out
if the queen dies?"
259,"00:17:31,650","00:17:33,684","- We're gonna be hunted!
- Everybody, calm down."
260,"00:17:35,421","00:17:37,621","- Look at the state of him now.
- Fear not."
261,"00:17:37,623","00:17:40,490","I have an in at, uh,
Regent's Park Zoo."
262,"00:17:40,492","00:17:42,893","Everyone, pack your bags!"
263,"00:17:43,963","00:17:45,529",Ah-ah.
264,"00:17:45,531","00:17:48,899","You help the queen,
or we are leaving."
265,"00:17:48,901","00:17:52,636","- You're bluffing.
- Don't make me count."
266,"00:17:52,638","00:17:54,504",Don't make me count.
267,"00:17:54,506","00:17:55,773",One.
268,"00:17:55,775","00:17:56,841",Three!
269,"00:17:56,843","00:17:58,042",Two.
270,"00:17:58,044","00:17:59,911",All right!
271,"00:17:59,913","00:18:01,511",I'll do it.
272,"00:18:01,513","00:18:03,513",Marvelous.
273,"00:18:03,515","00:18:05,449","Right, let's get you
ready to go, honey."
274,"00:18:05,451","00:18:07,218","- I'll go as I am.
- Not looking like that."
275,"00:18:07,220","00:18:08,786","- Just grab my doctor's bag.
- Get him."
276,"00:18:08,788","00:18:09,787","Apologies, Doc."
277,"00:18:09,789","00:18:11,222","Hold still, now."
278,"00:18:11,224","00:18:14,025",Take your paws off me!
279,"00:18:14,027","00:18:16,694","- This isn't gonna hurt a bit.
- Let's clean him up."
280,"00:18:16,696","00:18:18,730",How dare you.
281,"00:18:18,732","00:18:20,698","- Whoa.
- Oh, hey, guys."
282,"00:18:20,700","00:18:22,634","Arthur? How long have you
been living in there?"
283,"00:18:22,636","00:18:24,602","I don't know.
What year is it?"
284,"00:18:25,739","00:18:26,971",Dab-Dab's got the razor.
285,"00:18:26,973","00:18:28,740",That's still celery.
286,"00:18:28,742","00:18:31,411","Nighty-night, Doc."
287,"00:18:38,953","00:18:41,552","Dolittle used to
travel all around the world."
288,"00:18:41,554","00:18:42,821",Look.
289,"00:18:43,858","00:18:45,824","Rummaging through
my private projects, is it?"
290,"00:18:45,826","00:18:47,927",How is he?
291,"00:18:47,929","00:18:49,728","Well, first things first,"
292,"00:18:49,730","00:18:51,897",the squirrel's name is Kevin.
293,"00:18:51,899","00:18:53,666",Expect a full recovery.
294,"00:18:53,668","00:18:56,602","And after some violent
grooming, it's been decided."
295,"00:18:56,604","00:18:59,707","We will accompany you
to Buckingham Palace after all."
296,"00:19:00,841","00:19:03,542","Hmm.
You are going back"
297,"00:19:03,544","00:19:05,978","to whatever burrow
you emerged from."
298,"00:19:05,980","00:19:08,783","Try not to shoot anything
on your way home."
299,"00:19:19,727","00:19:21,995","Maybe I-I should stay here.
I don't do well in crowds."
300,"00:19:21,997","00:19:23,629","We'll look after you, Cheech."
301,"00:19:23,631","00:19:26,132","But we all go together,
just like the old days."
302,"00:19:26,134","00:19:27,934","Oh, don't forget Doc's forceps."
303,"00:19:27,936","00:19:29,635","That's a leek, Dab-Dab."
304,"00:19:29,637","00:19:31,037",Sure it is.
305,"00:19:31,039","00:19:32,604",Styx?
306,"00:19:32,606","00:19:33,773",No.
307,"00:19:33,775","00:19:35,842",Where are you? Oh.
308,"00:19:35,844","00:19:37,844","So, uh, would you care
to come along?"
309,"00:19:40,582","00:19:43,016","I know.
I had other plans as well."
310,"00:19:44,152","00:19:46,021",Hurry up. Hurry up.
311,"00:19:47,656","00:19:48,890",Shh!
312,"00:20:12,881","00:20:15,782",Prepare my ride.
313,"00:20:15,784","00:20:17,584",Today's gonna be a good day.
314,"00:20:17,586","00:20:19,719","I'm gonna do nothing...
just prance around,"
315,"00:20:19,721","00:20:20,921",think my own thoughts and...
316,"00:20:20,923","00:20:23,057","- Oh, he's walking this way. Not a great sign.
- Oh, uh..."
317,"00:20:23,059","00:20:24,692","He's got no beard.
He looks motivated."
318,"00:20:24,694","00:20:25,926","Uh, no. Plimpton, don't be alarmed."
319,"00:20:25,928","00:20:28,162","People only say that when
they're about to be alarming."
320,"00:20:28,164","00:20:29,797","- Look, I know it's been a while.
- Sorry about this."
321,"00:20:29,799","00:20:33,067","- And sorry about that.
- All right."
322,"00:20:33,069","00:20:34,635",I'm unavailable.
323,"00:20:34,637","00:20:35,803","Unavailable for the man
who changed your life?"
324,"00:20:35,805","00:20:37,772","We're going to save
the queen, bro!"
325,"00:20:37,774","00:20:39,707",I am not your bro.
326,"00:20:39,709","00:20:41,609","You should be
an Eskimo's rug by now."
327,"00:20:41,611","00:20:42,843","- Ow. Claws.
- Ow! Beak!"
328,"00:20:42,845","00:20:43,978","- Claws.
- Beak!"
329,"00:20:43,980","00:20:45,713","Now, now, gentlemen."
330,"00:20:45,715","00:20:48,682","Oh, you've gained weight."
331,"00:20:48,684","00:20:50,218",Why are you riding me?
332,"00:20:50,220","00:20:52,620","There's, like, four horses
in front of us."
333,"00:20:52,622","00:20:54,021","Cheer up, angry bird."
334,"00:20:54,023","00:20:56,124",Kick back and enjoy the ride.
335,"00:20:56,126","00:20:58,160",I am the ride.
336,"00:21:01,098","00:21:03,231",Buckingham Palace.
337,"00:21:03,233","00:21:05,903",We've hit the big time!
338,"00:21:08,972","00:21:11,175",Full speed no longer required!
339,"00:21:15,813","00:21:18,246",Whoa.
340,"00:21:18,248","00:21:20,248","Welcome home, milady."
341,"00:21:23,887","00:21:25,253",Guards! Guards!
342,"00:21:30,994","00:21:32,828","Your ladyship, Rose."
343,"00:21:32,830","00:21:35,063","They are the queen's
own guests."
344,"00:21:35,065","00:21:37,032",Treat them accordingly.
345,"00:21:37,034","00:21:38,867","You better
give us a wide berth."
346,"00:21:38,869","00:21:39,968","Make way, boys."
347,"00:21:39,970","00:21:42,838","Plimpton, don't. Stop."
348,"00:21:42,840","00:21:44,773","- Don't stop? Odd decision, but...
- Stop!"
349,"00:21:44,775","00:21:47,443",Whoa!
350,"00:21:50,747","00:21:52,048",Aah! Can't see!
351,"00:21:52,050","00:21:54,052","Oh, my God."
352,"00:21:56,121","00:21:57,887","Oh, uh..."
353,"00:21:57,889","00:21:59,856",Okay.
354,"00:21:59,858","00:22:01,893",I blame the hat.
355,"00:22:12,003","00:22:13,838",Dr. Müdfly.
356,"00:22:14,906","00:22:16,072",Lord Badgley.
357,"00:22:16,074","00:22:17,173",My lord.
358,"00:22:17,175","00:22:19,909",I come from the House of Lords.
359,"00:22:19,911","00:22:22,814","There is great concern
for Her Majesty's health."
360,"00:22:24,916","00:22:27,717",I shall continue to leech
361,"00:22:27,719","00:22:31,321","to circulate the vapors
in the bloodstream."
362,"00:22:31,323","00:22:34,226","She'll be lucky
to last the week."
363,"00:22:37,795","00:22:40,330","This is not the first time
Dr. Dolittle's been here."
364,"00:22:40,332","00:22:43,000","You got a dying queen?
Not for long."
365,"00:22:43,002","00:22:44,835",Dr. Dolittle is in the...
366,"00:22:47,139","00:22:49,072","Oh, uh, wait. Wait for me!"
367,"00:22:49,074","00:22:52,109","A stowaway, my lady,
who claims to be Dr...."
368,"00:22:52,111","00:22:53,844",Dr. Dolittle's apprentice.
369,"00:22:53,846","00:22:55,214","It's quite all right, Gareth."
370,"00:22:57,883","00:22:59,183","Well, if he was my apprentice,"
371,"00:22:59,185","00:23:02,753","he should fetch my bags
and keep his gob shut."
372,"00:23:06,225","00:23:08,959","- A bird.
- A duck."
373,"00:23:08,961","00:23:11,094",Animals in the queen's chamber?
374,"00:23:11,096","00:23:13,164","I demand their
immediate remov..."
375,"00:23:13,166","00:23:14,898","Ah, Lady Rose."
376,"00:23:14,900","00:23:16,800","My apologies.
Please forgive me."
377,"00:23:16,802","00:23:18,902","I didn't realize
that you were part of..."
378,"00:23:18,904","00:23:20,238",John Dolittle?
379,"00:23:20,240","00:23:22,873","- Is that Blaine?
- Blair."
380,"00:23:22,875","00:23:24,142",Poopfling?
381,"00:23:24,144","00:23:25,109","- No.
- It was Mudflap?"
382,"00:23:25,111","00:23:27,946","- No, it's Müdfly.
- It was... Müdfly."
383,"00:23:27,948","00:23:29,780","- With an umlaut.
- Yes."
384,"00:23:29,782","00:23:30,982","- From the German.
- Of course."
385,"00:23:30,984","00:23:32,850","- From the Germans.
- Why is he here?"
386,"00:23:32,852","00:23:35,222","Her Majesty has personally
requested Dr. Dolittle."
387,"00:23:47,200","00:23:49,133","Well, then, let's get to work."
388,"00:23:49,135","00:23:51,905","All right, Jip,
give her a good sniff."
389,"00:23:59,179","00:24:00,945","- That dog is licking the queen.
- Don't worry, my love."
390,"00:24:00,947","00:24:02,147",This is outrageous.
391,"00:24:09,823","00:24:11,290","Oh, bark."
392,"00:24:11,292","00:24:14,159","- You all right, fellow?
- Something smelled wrong."
393,"00:24:14,161","00:24:16,829","And that's coming from a guy
who loves the smell of butts."
394,"00:24:16,831","00:24:18,030","Oh, you do love butt."
395,"00:24:18,032","00:24:19,932","I detected a whiff
of something else."
396,"00:24:19,934","00:24:21,233","Floral, with earthy..."
397,"00:24:24,272","00:24:25,871","I'm perplexed, Doc."
398,"00:24:25,873","00:24:27,840","I've never smelt anything
like it before."
399,"00:24:27,842","00:24:31,844","Uh, clearly, Jipsy and I
are out of our depths."
400,"00:24:31,846","00:24:33,846","- May we consult?
- Well, of course."
401,"00:24:33,848","00:24:35,283","I'd be more than happy
to help illuminate..."
402,"00:24:56,937","00:25:00,974","John and I were students
at Edinburgh years ago."
403,"00:25:00,976","00:25:04,880","Some thought he had
a gift for observation."
404,"00:25:11,987","00:25:13,286",One minute.
405,"00:25:18,661","00:25:21,129","Oh, sorry about that, Mini."
406,"00:25:24,232","00:25:26,066",Stay here.
407,"00:25:26,068","00:25:28,001","Dab-Dab, clear out the humans."
408,"00:25:28,003","00:25:30,504","Boyo, fetch the ""Botanical
Index"" and the tea tin."
409,"00:25:30,506","00:25:31,605",Everyone out.
410,"00:25:31,607","00:25:34,140","Do you understand the words
coming out of my bill?"
411,"00:25:38,247","00:25:39,979","What do you smell, Jip?"
412,"00:25:39,981","00:25:41,315",Elderberries?
413,"00:25:41,317","00:25:43,451",Hemlock?
414,"00:25:43,453","00:25:46,954",Negative.
415,"00:25:46,956","00:25:48,257",Negative.
416,"00:25:51,194","00:25:52,360","Aye, aye."
417,"00:26:00,503","00:26:02,336","What have you found, Dolittle?"
418,"00:26:02,338","00:26:04,338","Well, quite possibly,
the answer to everything."
419,"00:26:04,340","00:26:06,006",Exposure to toxic...
420,"00:26:06,008","00:26:07,408","God, he was like this
at school."
421,"00:26:07,410","00:26:09,009","""Lean in, lean in."
422,"00:26:09,011","00:26:10,978","I'm saying something
interesting."""
423,"00:26:10,980","00:26:12,447",I am interested.
424,"00:26:12,449","00:26:14,716","The queen's symptoms
are due to the effect"
425,"00:26:14,718","00:26:16,551",of a rare Sumatran plant
426,"00:26:16,553","00:26:19,354",known as the nightshade flower.
427,"00:26:19,356","00:26:24,024","A solar eclipse will occur
on the 17th of this very month."
428,"00:26:24,026","00:26:26,428","If she has not received
the antidote by then,"
429,"00:26:26,430","00:26:28,165",she will perish.
430,"00:26:29,433","00:26:31,299",Is that a Turner?
431,"00:26:31,301","00:26:33,535","Must be.
What a fine painting."
432,"00:26:33,537","00:26:36,438","I say, Dolittle,
what is your plan?"
433,"00:26:36,440","00:26:38,039",The plan?
434,"00:26:38,041","00:26:40,742","Uh, I suppose we do need one."
435,"00:26:40,744","00:26:42,244","Well, the queen's only hope"
436,"00:26:42,246","00:26:44,045","is a cure that's
never been tested,"
437,"00:26:44,047","00:26:45,748","from a tree
that's never been seen,"
438,"00:26:45,750","00:26:48,049","on an island
that's never been found."
439,"00:26:48,051","00:26:49,518","Sounds ridiculous
saying it out loud."
440,"00:26:49,520","00:26:51,088",But regardless of that...
441,"00:26:52,456","00:26:54,423","...we have no choice
but to embark"
442,"00:26:54,425","00:26:56,258",on this perilous journey
443,"00:26:56,260","00:26:59,094","to obtain the fruit
of the Eden Tree."
444,"00:26:59,096","00:27:00,530",What?
445,"00:27:00,532","00:27:03,499","Eden Tree. Oh, my. Fantastic."
446,"00:27:03,501","00:27:07,403","The Dolittles with
their Eden Tree Island."
447,"00:27:07,405","00:27:10,038","- Isn't it enough that your wife...
- Shut up, Blair!"
448,"00:27:10,040","00:27:11,340","Sorry, I-I meant to say:"
449,"00:27:11,342","00:27:14,042","""Lovely to see you
again, Blair."""
450,"00:27:14,044","00:27:16,579",We're off now. Ta-ra.
451,"00:27:16,581","00:27:19,782","Oh, its fruit is said to cure
every malady known to man,"
452,"00:27:19,784","00:27:21,350","grant eternal life,"
453,"00:27:21,352","00:27:23,319","even restore
the hair on your head."
454,"00:27:23,321","00:27:25,421","You must let nothing
pass her lips"
455,"00:27:25,423","00:27:27,790","that hasn't been made
and served by you."
456,"00:27:27,792","00:27:29,125",Clear?
457,"00:27:29,127","00:27:31,260","Yes, I'll see to it."
458,"00:27:31,262","00:27:32,796",That's us to the carriage.
459,"00:27:32,798","00:27:35,198","Jip, you need to stay behind
and guard the queen."
460,"00:27:35,200","00:27:37,633","- Very important.
- Right, guard dog mode."
461,"00:27:37,635","00:27:40,505","Stand back, everyone,
while I secure the perimeter."
462,"00:27:43,374","00:27:44,510",Excuse me.
463,"00:27:48,581","00:27:51,415","I do so admire
how you don't give up."
464,"00:27:51,417","00:27:53,550","The queen is counting
on both of you."
465,"00:27:53,552","00:27:55,354",Good luck.
466,"00:27:58,224","00:28:00,056",Right. Chop-chop.
467,"00:28:00,058","00:28:02,058","We got a long voyage
in front of us,"
468,"00:28:02,060","00:28:04,394","and the boat isn't
gonna sail itself."
469,"00:28:04,396","00:28:06,597","Deep breath, Yoshi."
470,"00:28:06,599","00:28:09,600",We haven't got all day.
471,"00:28:09,602","00:28:11,301",Seems like she's full up.
472,"00:28:11,303","00:28:13,570","Maybe we could
squeeze in one more."
473,"00:28:13,572","00:28:15,272",Plenty of room.
474,"00:28:15,274","00:28:17,541","- Oh, no.
- Uh, Plimpton."
475,"00:28:17,543","00:28:20,177","I mean, one more stop,
good fellow."
476,"00:28:20,179","00:28:22,579","I can't hear you,
because I am not here."
477,"00:28:22,581","00:28:25,549","Well, I believe it's time
to go our separate ways."
478,"00:28:25,551","00:28:27,384","Uh, I'm going with you."
479,"00:28:27,386","00:28:28,686",Certainly not.
480,"00:28:28,688","00:28:30,153",It's far too treacherous.
481,"00:28:30,155","00:28:31,288",I'm your apprentice.
482,"00:28:31,290","00:28:32,489","You? No, no, no."
483,"00:28:32,491","00:28:34,124","Oh, you have an apprentice?"
484,"00:28:34,126","00:28:35,560","You don't need an apprentice
and an ostrich."
485,"00:28:35,562","00:28:37,094",I'll go home.
486,"00:28:37,096","00:28:38,262","I didn't want
to be embarrassed,"
487,"00:28:38,264","00:28:39,464",so I pretended you belonged.
488,"00:28:39,466","00:28:41,432","I was helpful in there,
wasn't I?"
489,"00:28:41,434","00:28:43,434","- Hmm...
- The animals like me."
490,"00:28:43,436","00:28:46,103",I don't take up much space.
491,"00:28:46,105","00:28:48,439",I think I belong here.
492,"00:28:48,441","00:28:51,175",Don't make me go home.
493,"00:28:51,177","00:28:52,646",Please.
494,"00:29:04,190","00:29:05,723",What is that around your neck?
495,"00:29:05,725","00:29:07,258",Come on.
496,"00:29:07,260","00:29:09,160","I'm worried about the boy,
Bethan."
497,"00:29:09,162","00:29:11,129",Give him time. Time is all.
498,"00:29:11,131","00:29:12,597","We're hunters, Bethan."
499,"00:29:12,599","00:29:15,500","Hunters.
It has a certain..."
500,"00:29:15,502","00:29:17,201",We hunt things.
501,"00:29:17,203","00:29:18,469",He frees things.
502,"00:29:18,471","00:29:20,204",Like rabbits and mice.
503,"00:29:20,206","00:29:22,340",He carries spiders outside.
504,"00:29:22,342","00:29:24,679","Nobody likes spiders...
not even spiders."
505,"00:29:26,380","00:29:28,614","I don't know how your sister
put up with him."
506,"00:29:50,738","00:29:53,172",Ugh. Ugh.
507,"00:29:54,375","00:29:56,375","Poly?
What are you doing here?"
508,"00:29:56,377","00:29:58,611","Making sure
you don't miss the boat."
509,"00:29:58,613","00:30:03,282","A-Am I talking to an animal,
just like Dolittle?"
510,"00:30:03,284","00:30:05,517","Oh, no.
I'm speaking human."
511,"00:30:05,519","00:30:07,453","Better than any parrot
ever has, actually."
512,"00:30:08,790","00:30:11,390","Now, let's pack some clothes.
Come on."
513,"00:30:16,398","00:30:19,264","But Dolittle said
I belong here."
514,"00:30:19,266","00:30:21,601","Little help, Tutu?"
515,"00:30:21,603","00:30:24,537","Well, I never heard him say
anything of the sort."
516,"00:30:25,574","00:30:28,408","There's something special
about you, Stubbins."
517,"00:30:28,410","00:30:32,278","Something I've only seen
in two other humans."
518,"00:30:32,280","00:30:34,681","You belong with us, kid."
519,"00:30:34,683","00:30:37,717","And you let me worry
about Dolittle. That's my job."
520,"00:30:37,719","00:30:42,424","So, are you ready for
the adventure of a lifetime?"
521,"00:30:46,829","00:30:48,561",I'm in.
522,"00:30:48,563","00:30:50,330",Of course you are.
523,"00:30:50,332","00:30:51,431","Poly, let's move."
524,"00:30:51,433","00:30:53,601","We got a boat to catch,
and we're burning daylight."
525,"00:30:53,603","00:30:55,301","Fret not, ma chérie."
526,"00:30:55,303","00:30:57,303",We have the perfect plan.
527,"00:30:57,305","00:30:58,572",New plan!
528,"00:30:58,574","00:30:59,840",New plan!
529,"00:30:59,842","00:31:02,443","Come on!
Don't let them get away!"
530,"00:31:03,579","00:31:05,379",Why are they chasing us?
531,"00:31:05,381","00:31:06,681",We're not criminals.
532,"00:31:06,683","00:31:08,315",Speak for yourself.
533,"00:31:08,317","00:31:09,850",We're wanted in three forests.
534,"00:31:09,852","00:31:12,853","And it's not an escape mission
unless you're being chased."
535,"00:31:12,855","00:31:15,489",Whoa!
536,"00:31:15,491","00:31:17,391",That tickles!
537,"00:31:17,393","00:31:18,626","Which way, Tutu?"
538,"00:31:18,628","00:31:21,295","- Down!
- Whoa!"
539,"00:31:21,297","00:31:23,264",Clear the way!
540,"00:31:23,266","00:31:24,598",Hey! This way!
541,"00:31:24,600","00:31:27,535","Get off the road, ma chérie."
542,"00:31:27,537","00:31:30,337","See you later, suckers."
543,"00:31:35,813","00:31:38,279",Whew. We've done it.
544,"00:31:38,281","00:31:39,781",We've done it. We...
545,"00:31:39,783","00:31:41,717",Missed it.
546,"00:31:41,719","00:31:44,285","Okay, boss,
what's our next move?"
547,"00:31:44,287","00:31:46,488","We cut our losses,
change our identities,"
548,"00:31:46,490","00:31:47,789",ditch the kid in the river.
549,"00:31:47,791","00:31:49,356","Whoa, whoa, whoa, easy."
550,"00:31:49,358","00:31:50,627",Wh-Wh-What about that bridge?
551,"00:31:51,695","00:31:52,794","Yes, the bridge."
552,"00:31:52,796","00:31:54,696","Uh, that was
my next suggestion."
553,"00:31:54,698","00:31:55,766",Let's go!
554,"00:31:57,701","00:31:58,900","Come on, Doc."
555,"00:31:58,902","00:32:00,602","At least get out
of the hammock."
556,"00:32:00,604","00:32:03,338",Your seasickness will wear off.
557,"00:32:03,340","00:32:05,373",Try some of this ginger root.
558,"00:32:05,375","00:32:07,375","You'll get your sea legs back.
You look terrible."
559,"00:32:07,377","00:32:08,677","Ah, button it."
560,"00:32:08,679","00:32:10,645",Who put me in this hammock?
561,"00:32:10,647","00:32:13,782","I am the captain
of this ship, right?"
562,"00:32:13,784","00:32:16,384","Raise the blasted sails, will you?"
563,"00:32:16,386","00:32:19,554","Uh, that's a big bite."
564,"00:32:21,558","00:32:22,792","Everyone, look."
565,"00:32:22,794","00:32:24,526",Is that the boy?
566,"00:32:24,528","00:32:26,095",He's coming to finish the job!
567,"00:32:26,097","00:32:27,764",He won't rest till I'm dead!
568,"00:32:27,766","00:32:29,397",He's obsessed!
569,"00:32:29,399","00:32:31,801","- John, slow the boat down.
- No."
570,"00:32:31,803","00:32:34,504","- I want to go faster. I want...
- Sorry, kid. Doc says no."
571,"00:32:34,506","00:32:35,938","We're going to miss
all the good current!"
572,"00:32:35,940","00:32:38,808","- I hope you make it.
- Me, too, Dabs."
573,"00:32:42,680","00:32:44,680","- All right, Bets, moment of truth.
- Okay."
574,"00:32:44,682","00:32:47,817","Oh, big hole, 12 o'clock!"
575,"00:32:47,819","00:32:49,452",Maybe this is a bad idea.
576,"00:32:51,890","00:32:53,123","- Let's go, Stubbins, let's go!
- Come on, kid."
577,"00:32:53,125","00:32:54,390","Get on the boat!
Get on the boat!"
578,"00:32:55,760","00:32:56,826",I've run out of track!
579,"00:32:56,828","00:32:58,594",But not courage!
580,"00:32:58,596","00:33:00,830","- Fly and be free!
- Whoa!"
581,"00:33:07,572","00:33:09,474",Vive la résistance!
582,"00:33:12,577","00:33:14,412","- Whoa!
- Is that thing up to code?"
583,"00:33:15,915","00:33:17,648",Whoa. Whoa.
584,"00:33:26,492","00:33:27,858",No!
585,"00:33:27,860","00:33:28,959",No.
586,"00:33:30,696","00:33:32,796","Jump, murderer.
You got this."
587,"00:33:39,772","00:33:41,538","Oh, I can't look."
588,"00:33:45,544","00:33:47,744","No, no, no, no, no, no, no!"
589,"00:33:50,850","00:33:52,851",Do it again! Do it again!
590,"00:33:52,853","00:33:55,552","- Do it again! Do it again!
- Yes!"
591,"00:33:55,554","00:33:57,454","- Crushed it, kid.
- Do it again! Do it again!"
592,"00:33:57,456","00:33:58,689",You made it.
593,"00:33:58,691","00:34:01,759","Why y'all cheering
for the kid who shot me?"
594,"00:34:01,761","00:34:03,828","Ah, he's all right."
595,"00:34:03,830","00:34:05,495",Darling.
596,"00:34:05,497","00:34:07,497","- Can I have a word, please? Huh.
- Glad you came around"
597,"00:34:07,499","00:34:09,734",and saw things my...
598,"00:34:09,736","00:34:12,036",What was she thinking?
599,"00:34:12,038","00:34:14,439",The boy nearly killed himself.
600,"00:34:14,441","00:34:16,641","Oi! This is my ship, right?"
601,"00:34:16,643","00:34:18,509",And I'm its sovereign.
602,"00:34:18,511","00:34:19,711",And there are consequences...
603,"00:34:19,713","00:34:20,745",To ignoring me.
604,"00:34:20,747","00:34:22,513","- Is that what you were going to say?
- No, no."
605,"00:34:22,515","00:34:23,915",Don't mince my words.
606,"00:34:23,917","00:34:25,917","And stop messing
with my routine."
607,"00:34:25,919","00:34:28,519","But look at the state of you.
You're sick as a dog."
608,"00:34:28,521","00:34:30,521","Uh, but actually,
I have my medicine."
609,"00:34:30,523","00:34:33,524","See? This licorice root
is working a treat."
610,"00:34:33,526","00:34:35,860","Sit down, John."
611,"00:34:37,664","00:34:39,865","Don't embarrass me
in front of the crew."
612,"00:34:39,867","00:34:42,500",I'm sparing you embarrassment.
613,"00:34:42,502","00:34:43,769",You need a trim.
614,"00:34:43,771","00:34:45,603","All right, all right, be quick."
615,"00:34:45,605","00:34:47,940","It's important to maintain
my status, yeah?"
616,"00:34:47,942","00:34:50,809","This ship is dangerous...
no place for a... Ow."
617,"00:34:50,811","00:34:51,810","- Ow!
- What? - Huh?"
618,"00:34:51,812","00:34:52,845","Hurts, man!"
619,"00:34:52,847","00:34:54,546",Private conversation.
620,"00:34:54,548","00:34:55,814","- Oh, okay. - Okay.
- Sorry."
621,"00:34:57,551","00:35:00,886","I know this particular voyage
is hard for you, John."
622,"00:35:00,888","00:35:02,821","It is for me, too."
623,"00:35:02,823","00:35:05,557","I brought you Lily
just when you needed her,"
624,"00:35:05,559","00:35:08,261","and now you need
one of your own kind again."
625,"00:35:08,263","00:35:12,265","Someone without feathers
or fur."
626,"00:35:12,267","00:35:14,700","Fine, the boy can stay,
but it'll be on my terms."
627,"00:35:14,702","00:35:16,102",And I'll keep him quite busy.
628,"00:35:16,104","00:35:18,572","You'll do it
with a smile on your face."
629,"00:35:19,774","00:35:20,973",Crew!
630,"00:35:20,975","00:35:23,979",Seems you got a new shipmate.
631,"00:35:27,715","00:35:29,983","As I just told Poly,"
632,"00:35:29,985","00:35:32,551","we are a bit shorthanded
after all, so..."
633,"00:35:32,553","00:35:33,787",You won't regret it.
634,"00:35:33,789","00:35:34,955",Welcome aboard.
635,"00:35:34,957","00:35:36,823","I hear you could be
a big help..."
636,"00:35:36,825","00:35:38,590",...by cleaning this up.
637,"00:35:38,592","00:35:40,026","That, too,
if you wouldn't mind."
638,"00:35:40,028","00:35:41,661",Oops. Those as well.
639,"00:35:41,663","00:35:43,663",And that.
640,"00:35:43,665","00:35:44,998",I got these.
641,"00:35:45,000","00:35:47,469","Careful with that
medical equipment."
642,"00:35:49,771","00:35:53,008","Because a parrot's in charge
of my ship! Brilliant!"
643,"00:35:54,643","00:35:57,612","He's absolutely thrilled
to have you."
644,"00:36:10,625","00:36:13,060",Hmm.
645,"00:36:13,062","00:36:14,962","Hello there, little squid."
646,"00:36:14,964","00:36:17,564","You don't understand me,
do you?"
647,"00:36:17,566","00:36:19,033",That would be preposterous.
648,"00:36:19,035","00:36:22,036","- Müdfly.
- I wasn't talking to the squid!"
649,"00:36:22,038","00:36:25,973","I'm dispatching a frigate,
the Britannia,"
650,"00:36:25,975","00:36:28,676",to follow Dolittle.
651,"00:36:28,678","00:36:32,582","But you must not support him
in his foolishness, my lord."
652,"00:36:37,153","00:36:39,120",England has enemies everywhere
653,"00:36:39,122","00:36:43,057","waiting for the slightest
sign of weakness."
654,"00:36:43,059","00:36:46,594","Entrusting beloved Britain
to a child queen?"
655,"00:36:46,596","00:36:48,596",That is lunacy.
656,"00:36:48,598","00:36:49,964","So, while I remain here"
657,"00:36:49,966","00:36:52,933","ensuring no one prevents me
from taking the throne,"
658,"00:36:52,935","00:36:55,870",you will be on the Britannia
659,"00:36:55,872","00:37:00,077","making certain
Dolittle never returns."
660,"00:37:13,824","00:37:15,090","Great. Round two, yeah?"
661,"00:37:15,092","00:37:17,225","You got me on the ropes,
you have, Cheech."
662,"00:37:17,227","00:37:19,027","Come on. One, two."
663,"00:37:19,029","00:37:20,695","Jab, jab, cross."
664,"00:37:21,499","00:37:22,831","The best form of defense
is attack."
665,"00:37:40,717","00:37:42,751","I really don't want
to fight you."
666,"00:37:42,753","00:37:44,253","We're not fighting, are we?"
667,"00:37:44,255","00:37:45,789",It's a therapeutic session.
668,"00:37:56,434","00:37:58,034",I-I think I'm getting this.
669,"00:37:58,036","00:37:59,838","I'm actually starting
to understand."
670,"00:38:32,171","00:38:35,771","Stop worrying, John."
671,"00:38:35,773","00:38:39,042","Every step is planned out
in my journal."
672,"00:38:39,044","00:38:42,747","I'll be back
before you even miss me."
673,"00:38:52,191","00:38:54,160",Are you all right?
674,"00:38:57,196","00:38:59,497","I think I'm beginning
to understand"
675,"00:38:59,499","00:39:01,965","a little bit of what
the animals are saying."
676,"00:39:01,967","00:39:03,736","Seems you are, boyo."
677,"00:39:12,179","00:39:14,878","What kind of polar bear
works on their tan?"
678,"00:39:14,880","00:39:16,813","Well, what kind of bird..."
679,"00:39:16,815","00:39:18,782","Wait, are you even a bird?"
680,"00:39:18,784","00:39:20,351","- Of course I am.
- Well, can you fly?"
681,"00:39:20,353","00:39:21,818","- No.
- Can you swim?"
682,"00:39:21,820","00:39:22,819",No.
683,"00:39:22,821","00:39:23,955","Well, what can you do?"
684,"00:39:23,957","00:39:25,523","- I can run.
- I can run."
685,"00:39:25,525","00:39:27,225",What bird stuff can you do?
686,"00:39:27,227","00:39:29,294","Well, what bear stuff
can you do?"
687,"00:39:31,831","00:39:33,200",You win this round.
688,"00:39:45,546","00:39:46,945",Ro...
689,"00:39:48,014","00:39:49,280",Pickles?
690,"00:39:50,917","00:39:53,117","Oh, you were saying ""warship."""
691,"00:39:54,287","00:39:56,221","Weird time to be asking
for pickles."
692,"00:39:56,223","00:39:58,122","I mean, who could eat
when we're under attack?"
693,"00:39:58,124","00:40:00,858","Enemy, starboard aft."
694,"00:40:00,860","00:40:03,861","Elliott, you and Elsie
ready the machine."
695,"00:40:03,863","00:40:07,066","We're gonna need speed.
Send out the call."
696,"00:40:13,074","00:40:14,139",Which way are the lifeboats?
697,"00:40:14,141","00:40:15,274","This whole thing is
a death boat."
698,"00:40:15,276","00:40:16,875","Mini, mind the lookout."
699,"00:40:16,877","00:40:19,878","Stubbins, boy, I need you
now more than ever..."
700,"00:40:19,880","00:40:21,981","- to stand still.
- I surrender!"
701,"00:40:21,983","00:40:23,349",We surrender!
702,"00:40:23,351","00:40:25,217",Oh...
703,"00:40:25,219","00:40:27,820","hello, Blair,
you chinless wonder."
704,"00:40:28,823","00:40:32,291","He said something
about my chin, didn't he?"
705,"00:40:32,293","00:40:34,293","It's a magnificent chin, sir."
706,"00:40:34,295","00:40:35,894",We're in their sights.
707,"00:40:35,896","00:40:37,430",Cannons are taking aim.
708,"00:40:37,432","00:40:40,165",Let's turn this ship!
709,"00:40:41,902","00:40:44,169",I'm on my way.
710,"00:40:44,171","00:40:48,009","It is time for me to slip into
something less comfortable."
711,"00:40:55,083","00:40:58,084",Hello...!
712,"00:40:58,086","00:41:00,188","I bought a front-row seat
to crazy town."
713,"00:41:03,325","00:41:04,958","Once Humphrey's been secured,"
714,"00:41:04,960","00:41:06,926","you pull me out
on Yoshi's signal."
715,"00:41:06,928","00:41:09,296","Me? No, I-I can't handle
that type of pressure, Doc."
716,"00:41:09,298","00:41:12,132","I'm a ""cheer quietly from
the sidelines"" kind of gorilla."
717,"00:41:12,134","00:41:13,900","Don't worry, Cheech."
718,"00:41:13,902","00:41:16,269","You'll rise
to the occasion, huh?"
719,"00:41:16,271","00:41:19,139",You're stronger than you know.
720,"00:41:19,141","00:41:22,942","Now, remember, courage
is not the absence of fear."
721,"00:41:22,944","00:41:25,413",Wait. You got cut off.
722,"00:41:25,415","00:41:27,113",I-I can't hear you.
723,"00:41:27,115","00:41:28,882",I need the second part!
724,"00:41:28,884","00:41:31,053","No time, Cheech. Let's go."
725,"00:41:42,298","00:41:43,664","Oh, look, look."
726,"00:41:43,666","00:41:45,466","They're already
abandoning ship."
727,"00:41:45,468","00:41:47,370",Boom!
728,"00:41:53,142","00:41:54,475","Oh, this is gonna be cold."
729,"00:41:54,477","00:41:56,412",But I'm coming in hot!
730,"00:42:03,353","00:42:05,052",Humphrey here.
731,"00:42:05,054","00:42:07,056",Let's hook it up.
732,"00:42:15,131","00:42:16,698",Where we headed?
733,"00:42:16,700","00:42:18,032",South.
734,"00:42:22,506","00:42:24,941","Okay, I can do this.
I can do this."
735,"00:42:29,045","00:42:30,712",Full steam ahead!
736,"00:42:30,714","00:42:32,383","Go, Humphrey, go!"
737,"00:42:33,550","00:42:35,384",Are they pulling away?
738,"00:42:36,520","00:42:38,520","Do it, whale, do it!"
739,"00:42:38,522","00:42:40,389","- Whoo-hoo!
- It's working!"
740,"00:42:40,391","00:42:42,090","- How is this possible?
- Well, sir, it appears"
741,"00:42:42,092","00:42:44,259","Dolittle and a polar bear
have harnessed a whale..."
742,"00:42:44,261","00:42:46,528",It was a rhetorical question.
743,"00:42:46,530","00:42:47,464",Just fire!
744,"00:42:53,303","00:42:55,337",I dropped the rope!
745,"00:43:04,047","00:43:06,116","I failed.
I knew I couldn't do it."
746,"00:43:18,062","00:43:19,995","- Yoshi!
- Hang on."
747,"00:43:19,997","00:43:21,499","I'm coming, kid!"
748,"00:43:23,334","00:43:25,334","- No, no, no, no, no, no, no!
- You're doing great."
749,"00:43:25,336","00:43:27,136","Oh, this is gonna
murder my back."
750,"00:43:27,138","00:43:30,241","Quit complaining,
you oversized flamingo."
751,"00:43:39,217","00:43:40,316","Oh, no, no, no."
752,"00:43:40,318","00:43:41,519","Oh, no."
753,"00:43:44,489","00:43:47,223","- Oh, no.
- Oh, no."
754,"00:44:02,174","00:44:04,109","- Oh!
- Yes!"
755,"00:44:11,116","00:44:13,217","I let you down, Doc."
756,"00:44:13,219","00:44:15,118",Look at me.
757,"00:44:15,120","00:44:17,087",I'm fine. We're all fine.
758,"00:44:17,089","00:44:19,323","- I froze.
- No, no, no, Cheech."
759,"00:44:19,325","00:44:21,291",It's okay to be scared.
760,"00:44:21,293","00:44:23,095",Mm-mm.
761,"00:44:26,131","00:44:27,531","You saved me, did you?"
762,"00:44:27,533","00:44:28,833",Fair play.
763,"00:44:28,835","00:44:30,369",Thanks very much.
764,"00:44:31,437","00:44:33,403","Well done, everybody."
765,"00:44:34,574","00:44:37,140","Feel like you belong now, kid?"
766,"00:44:37,142","00:44:39,076",I guess I do.
767,"00:44:39,078","00:44:40,545","- We lost 'em.
- I guess I do."
768,"00:44:40,547","00:44:42,279","Great work, gang."
769,"00:44:42,281","00:44:44,516","Eat our dust, Mudfly."
770,"00:44:53,527","00:44:55,293","- They've gotten away, sir.
- Oh, really?"
771,"00:44:55,295","00:44:57,161","I thought they disappeared
into thin air."
772,"00:44:57,163","00:44:59,097","I'm afraid not, sir.
They've escaped."
773,"00:44:59,099","00:45:00,298","Read the room, Lieutenant!"
774,"00:45:00,300","00:45:02,168",I can see they've escaped.
775,"00:45:03,236","00:45:05,639",But not for long.
776,"00:45:07,307","00:45:08,540",It's a miracle.
777,"00:45:08,542","00:45:11,175","That must mean
I am the chosen one."
778,"00:45:11,177","00:45:12,577",I'm gonna change the wor...
779,"00:45:12,579","00:45:15,480",Whale power.
780,"00:45:15,482","00:45:17,683","Dolittle had to write
a paper about it,"
781,"00:45:17,685","00:45:20,385","which, of course,
nobody took seriously."
782,"00:45:20,387","00:45:23,421","This one even theorizes
the existence of dragons."
783,"00:45:23,423","00:45:26,257",Just preposterous.
784,"00:45:26,259","00:45:28,727","Sir, I'm afraid your obsession
with Dolittle is..."
785,"00:45:28,729","00:45:30,596","What obsession?
I'm not obsessed with Dolittle."
786,"00:45:30,598","00:45:32,364",You're obsessed with Dolittle.
787,"00:45:32,366","00:45:34,669","You're the one obsessing
about my obsession with Dol..."
788,"00:45:36,737","00:45:38,737","I'm loath to admit it,"
789,"00:45:38,739","00:45:42,474","but he's more valuable alive
for now."
790,"00:45:42,476","00:45:44,510","But luckily,"
791,"00:45:44,512","00:45:47,214","I think I know
where he's going."
792,"00:45:50,418","00:45:52,418","Kevin's log, day seven."
793,"00:45:52,420","00:45:53,719",I'm now totally isolated.
794,"00:45:53,721","00:45:55,521","The enemy has
ingratiated himself"
795,"00:45:55,523","00:45:57,523",with the captain and crew.
796,"00:45:57,525","00:45:59,726","No sign of promised
tropical island"
797,"00:45:59,728","00:46:01,695",or the magic fruit.
798,"00:46:01,697","00:46:03,632",But I will endure.
799,"00:46:18,714","00:46:20,480","Take the wheel, Stubbins."
800,"00:46:20,482","00:46:21,781","- Really?
- Yeah, yeah."
801,"00:46:21,783","00:46:23,650","I have to calculate
our route coordinates."
802,"00:46:23,652","00:46:25,518",The bees are buzzing about you.
803,"00:46:25,520","00:46:26,953",Seems you are getting
804,"00:46:26,955","00:46:29,956","a rudimentary grasp
of their language."
805,"00:46:29,958","00:46:33,593",35 degrees portside.
806,"00:46:33,595","00:46:37,731","Well, I-I have noticed when
they fly in a zigzag pattern,"
807,"00:46:37,733","00:46:39,299",they sort of go...
808,"00:46:41,770","00:46:44,304","Which means: ""Back off, kid."""
809,"00:46:44,306","00:46:46,741","But when Dab-Dab goes, uh..."
810,"00:46:50,212","00:46:51,712","That means: ""Look at this."""
811,"00:46:51,714","00:46:53,614","Mm. ""Look at me."""
812,"00:46:53,616","00:46:55,382","- Oh, close.
- Not bad, though."
813,"00:46:55,384","00:46:57,654","Oh, uh...
No, when Chee-Chee says..."
814,"00:46:58,721","00:47:00,755",When Chee-Chee says...
815,"00:47:03,693","00:47:08,228","That means:
""Where's my... blanket?"""
816,"00:47:08,230","00:47:09,499",Very good.
817,"00:47:13,670","00:47:16,003","Is that the map
of Eden Tree Island?"
818,"00:47:16,005","00:47:19,540","The Eden Tree cannot
be found on any map."
819,"00:47:19,542","00:47:21,542","And to call it an island
is to suggest"
820,"00:47:21,544","00:47:25,513","that it is of our world,
and it is anything but."
821,"00:47:25,515","00:47:28,349","That is why we must first go
to Monteverde,"
822,"00:47:28,351","00:47:29,617",birthplace of the only person
823,"00:47:29,619","00:47:31,585","to ever chart a course
to the tree."
824,"00:47:31,587","00:47:32,821",Her name was Lily.
825,"00:47:32,823","00:47:35,489","She wrote the route
in a journal,"
826,"00:47:35,491","00:47:37,726","but on her voyage,
she was shipwrecked."
827,"00:47:37,728","00:47:41,732","The world lost the greatest
explorer I've ever known."
828,"00:47:43,767","00:47:45,734","The journal
from that expedition"
829,"00:47:45,736","00:47:47,671",was all that survived.
830,"00:47:50,808","00:47:53,842","Elliot, Elsie, do you mind?"
831,"00:47:57,281","00:47:58,647","So, anyway,
you get the picture."
832,"00:47:58,649","00:48:00,615","To have any chance
of finding the tree,"
833,"00:48:00,617","00:48:03,552","we have to go to Monteverde and
steal that flippin' journal."
834,"00:48:03,554","00:48:05,454",Steal the journal?
835,"00:48:05,456","00:48:06,621",Did I say that?
836,"00:48:06,623","00:48:08,490","Well, what's the worst
that can happen?"
837,"00:48:12,763","00:48:15,363","Don't worry.
I know an omen when I see one,"
838,"00:48:15,365","00:48:17,666",and that was not an omen.
839,"00:48:18,837","00:48:21,871","Stealing the journal
is not a big deal."
840,"00:48:23,908","00:48:25,908","In fact,"
841,"00:48:25,910","00:48:29,411","Monteverde itself
is not a big deal."
842,"00:48:31,415","00:48:35,084","The stop at Monteverde
was a very big deal."
843,"00:48:35,086","00:48:38,421","After all, this island
of bandits and thieves"
844,"00:48:38,423","00:48:41,557","was once a place Dolittle,
Lily and I called home."
845,"00:48:41,559","00:48:43,826",Until the doctor
846,"00:48:43,828","00:48:48,831","made an enemy of the island's
notorious ruler, King Rassouli."
847,"00:48:48,833","00:48:51,801","And just our luck...
his most prized possession"
848,"00:48:51,803","00:48:54,604","was the very journal
we needed to steal."
849,"00:48:56,541","00:48:58,908",So Dolittle needed a disguise.
850,"00:49:04,482","00:49:07,818","While I was left watching
over the rest of the crew,"
851,"00:49:07,820","00:49:11,556","Dolittle and Stubbins
snuck into the palace."
852,"00:49:15,593","00:49:17,694",I'm about to die!
853,"00:49:20,566","00:49:22,666","Once inside, their path ended"
854,"00:49:22,668","00:49:25,402","at a heavily bolted door,
naturally."
855,"00:49:25,404","00:49:27,471",But Dolittle still had
856,"00:49:27,473","00:49:30,507","questionable contacts
on the island."
857,"00:49:30,509","00:49:31,575","Hut, hut, hut,"
858,"00:49:31,577","00:49:33,644","hut, hut, hut, hut, hut, hut..."
859,"00:49:33,646","00:49:35,612",The opening bid will suffice.
860,"00:49:35,614","00:49:37,447",You have my attention.
861,"00:49:37,449","00:49:38,749","Don Carpenterino,"
862,"00:49:38,751","00:49:40,918","I'm here on behalf
of these humans."
863,"00:49:40,920","00:49:42,719",They will pay you handsomely
864,"00:49:42,721","00:49:44,989","for your family's
lock-picking skills."
865,"00:49:44,991","00:49:46,857","You come to me for this,"
866,"00:49:46,859","00:49:49,426","on the day of
my daughter's wedding?"
867,"00:49:49,428","00:49:51,428","Wait a minute.
Which daughter?"
868,"00:49:51,430","00:49:53,430",It's not... Sh-Sheila?
869,"00:49:53,432","00:49:56,533","My Sheila?
She's getting married?"
870,"00:49:56,535","00:49:59,469","- To a scorpion named Dylan.
- Sorry, Boy Scout."
871,"00:49:59,471","00:50:01,505","I guess Sheila's
into bad boys now."
872,"00:50:03,409","00:50:05,777","We were gonna spend the rest
of our life spans together."
873,"00:50:05,779","00:50:07,444","Move on, James."
874,"00:50:07,446","00:50:09,747",What's your human's best offer?
875,"00:50:09,749","00:50:11,482",Two more now...
876,"00:50:11,484","00:50:13,418",and two later. Huh?
877,"00:50:13,420","00:50:15,653","Okay.
You have yourself a deal."
878,"00:50:15,655","00:50:17,889","See you around, Boy Scout."
879,"00:50:17,891","00:50:19,791","Guys, I'm no Boy Scout."
880,"00:50:19,793","00:50:23,561","Also, what's a scorpion got
that I don't got?"
881,"00:50:23,563","00:50:25,864","- Besides a massive stinger.
- Get over her, James."
882,"00:50:25,866","00:50:27,732",You dated for two weeks.
883,"00:50:35,009","00:50:36,843",These bars are new.
884,"00:50:37,912","00:50:39,544",Totally messing up my plan.
885,"00:50:39,546","00:50:40,812",I can fit through them.
886,"00:50:40,814","00:50:42,647","No, no, no.
It's too dangerous, man."
887,"00:50:42,649","00:50:45,650",Can't go in there on your own.
888,"00:50:45,652","00:50:47,686","Let me take him in, Doc."
889,"00:50:47,688","00:50:49,989","I need something to distract me
from this Sheila reveal."
890,"00:50:49,991","00:50:52,725","Are you sure your head's
in the right place, James?"
891,"00:50:52,727","00:50:54,593","Oh, yeah.
I'll get the kid in"
892,"00:50:54,595","00:50:56,228","and then fly headfirst
into a brick."
893,"00:50:56,230","00:50:58,497",Just kidding. I'm fine.
894,"00:50:58,499","00:51:00,532",Aye. All right.
895,"00:51:00,534","00:51:01,901","James will look after you.
It's fine."
896,"00:51:01,903","00:51:03,702",Listen closely.
897,"00:51:03,704","00:51:05,604","Get the journal
and get out of there."
898,"00:51:05,606","00:51:06,872",Go through the room quietly.
899,"00:51:06,874","00:51:08,507",Look for the tiger's eye.
900,"00:51:08,509","00:51:09,808",Go down the hidden staircase.
901,"00:51:09,810","00:51:12,978","And most importantly,
keep your disguise on."
902,"00:51:12,980","00:51:15,748","There's just one
little thing you should know."
903,"00:51:15,750","00:51:17,983",Rassouli loves his cats.
904,"00:51:20,855","00:51:23,957","But that's no problem for us,"
905,"00:51:23,959","00:51:26,792","'cause we can just fly
right over... Wait."
906,"00:51:26,794","00:51:28,761","Uh, I see the mistake
I made here."
907,"00:51:28,763","00:51:30,562",You can't fly.
908,"00:51:38,073","00:51:40,073","Hey. Oh. Watch out.
Kitty cat on your six."
909,"00:51:41,076","00:51:42,909","Oh, God."
910,"00:51:42,911","00:51:44,010","Oh, oh! Whoa, whoa!"
911,"00:51:44,012","00:51:45,712",Hey!
912,"00:51:45,714","00:51:47,547","Slick move, kid."
913,"00:51:48,817","00:51:51,284",We make a pretty good team.
914,"00:51:51,286","00:51:53,987",A real couple of bad boys.
915,"00:51:53,989","00:51:57,524","Okay, partner,
you know where to go."
916,"00:52:19,148","00:52:21,082",I'll keep watch on these lions.
917,"00:52:21,084","00:52:23,317","That's what a bad boy
dragonfly does."
918,"00:52:23,319","00:52:26,687","Would Dylan get
this close to a lion?"
919,"00:52:26,689","00:52:28,756",Would he get this close?
920,"00:52:28,758","00:52:30,324",How about this close?
921,"00:52:30,326","00:52:32,893","Oh, sh..."
922,"00:52:32,895","00:52:36,699","This is bad.
This is... very bad."
923,"00:52:39,869","00:52:41,637","""Lily..."
924,"00:52:42,705","00:52:44,107","Dolittle."""
925,"00:52:52,182","00:52:53,814",We got the journal! Open up!
926,"00:52:53,816","00:52:54,982",Just kidding. He blew it.
927,"00:52:54,984","00:52:56,018","- Bye!
- Oh, dear."
928,"00:52:56,020","00:52:57,785",Stubbins.
929,"00:53:01,691","00:53:03,091",Former resident here.
930,"00:53:03,093","00:53:04,926","- Don't move.
- Huh?"
931,"00:53:04,928","00:53:06,194",Don't touch.
932,"00:53:11,368","00:53:14,803","All I wanted was my daughter
to marry wisely,"
933,"00:53:14,805","00:53:18,740","and instead, I got
the ringleader of a circus."
934,"00:53:18,742","00:53:22,044","I never understood
what Lily saw in you."
935,"00:53:22,046","00:53:24,813","A common complaint
the world over"
936,"00:53:24,815","00:53:27,082","for fathers
of beloved daughters,"
937,"00:53:27,084","00:53:30,819","but in this instance,
I think we can all agree"
938,"00:53:30,821","00:53:34,056",it is particularly accurate.
939,"00:53:37,828","00:53:39,628",Come here.
940,"00:53:41,832","00:53:43,099",Come here. Come here.
941,"00:53:43,101","00:53:45,234","Um, so,
you didn't mean any of that."
942,"00:53:45,236","00:53:48,171",It was her journal.
943,"00:53:48,173","00:53:52,208","The only thing of hers
my men found in the wreckage."
944,"00:53:52,210","00:53:55,646",It belongs here.
945,"00:53:57,782","00:54:02,218","All you had to do was
never show your face again"
946,"00:54:02,220","00:54:04,120",and even at that...
947,"00:54:04,122","00:54:06,222",you failed.
948,"00:54:06,224","00:54:10,728","Now you'll pay
for taking Lily away from me."
949,"00:54:12,197","00:54:16,732","You knew what would happen
if you returned."
950,"00:54:16,734","00:54:18,435",Yes.
951,"00:54:21,739","00:54:23,739",Barry! Barry!
952,"00:54:23,741","00:54:27,177",Barry! Barry! Barry!
953,"00:54:27,179","00:54:31,215","Barry! Barry!
Barry! Barry!"
954,"00:54:31,217","00:54:32,982",You should go.
955,"00:54:32,984","00:54:35,252","Come on, Barry!"
956,"00:54:35,254","00:54:37,955","It's my past that's caught up
with me, not yours."
957,"00:54:37,957","00:54:40,057","- Yeah?
- But you're my friend."
958,"00:54:40,059","00:54:41,961",Go. Don't look back.
959,"00:54:49,168","00:54:52,769","You're better off
without him, kid."
960,"00:54:52,771","00:54:55,906",Um... I'm in compliance.
961,"00:54:55,908","00:54:57,908",Yes!
962,"00:54:57,910","00:54:59,309","Finally, some action down here."
963,"00:54:59,311","00:55:02,045","Boy, was it getting boring.
You know, Doc,"
964,"00:55:02,047","00:55:04,848","I hate to tell you, but you're
going down, my friend."
965,"00:55:04,850","00:55:06,817","You'd do well to keep
your buckteeth together."
966,"00:55:06,819","00:55:07,985",What is that smell?
967,"00:55:07,987","00:55:10,255","Hey, fellas,
I think Dr. Dolittle"
968,"00:55:10,257","00:55:12,789",did a little doo-doo.
969,"00:55:12,791","00:55:14,758","Did Dr. Dolittle do
a little doo-doo?"
970,"00:55:14,760","00:55:17,495","Perhaps when I'm out of here,
I'll teach you some manners"
971,"00:55:17,497","00:55:20,064","and accept your lucky foot
as payment."
972,"00:55:20,066","00:55:21,865","Oh, this lucky foot?"
973,"00:55:21,867","00:55:24,169","Don't worry about it, Doc,
'cause both of my lucky feet"
974,"00:55:24,171","00:55:26,070","are gonna be tap-dancing
on your grave"
975,"00:55:26,072","00:55:27,804",when my guy's done with you.
976,"00:55:27,806","00:55:30,308",Taking bets over here.
977,"00:55:30,310","00:55:33,044","In the right corner,
wearing golden stripes,"
978,"00:55:33,046","00:55:36,814","with a sparkling record
of 872 kills,"
979,"00:55:36,816","00:55:41,753","Barry ""The Butcher"" Bernstein!"
980,"00:55:47,127","00:55:50,128","Dr. Dolittle, remember me,"
981,"00:55:50,130","00:55:52,130",your old patient?
982,"00:55:52,132","00:55:54,333",It's Barry.
983,"00:55:54,335","00:55:55,967",Barry.
984,"00:55:55,969","00:55:57,536",How could I forget you?
985,"00:55:57,538","00:56:00,004","Oh, but you did, Doc."
986,"00:56:00,006","00:56:02,807","We were just starting
to make progress,"
987,"00:56:02,809","00:56:06,111","and then you run off
with Rassouli's daughter"
988,"00:56:06,113","00:56:07,845",and abandon me.
989,"00:56:07,847","00:56:10,049","Well, uh, I'm back now."
990,"00:56:10,051","00:56:12,251","Uh, perhaps we should just
pick up where we left off..."
991,"00:56:14,788","00:56:16,055",Enjoy the feast.
992,"00:56:19,393","00:56:22,127",What will happen to Dolittle?
993,"00:56:22,129","00:56:24,863","Oh. Well, he's a dead man."
994,"00:56:24,865","00:56:26,565",Yeah.
995,"00:56:26,567","00:56:29,902","He'll think he can talk
his way out of it, but, uh,"
996,"00:56:29,904","00:56:33,205",Barry has gone completely nuts.
997,"00:56:33,207","00:56:37,943","But you...
you are one of us now."
998,"00:56:37,945","00:56:40,848",To Dolittle's death!
999,"00:56:45,287","00:56:47,989","- Psst.
- Hey, it's you."
1000,"00:56:49,224","00:56:50,290",You made it.
1001,"00:56:50,292","00:56:51,957",I need you to get a message
1002,"00:56:51,959","00:56:53,126",to my friends on our boat.
1003,"00:56:53,128","00:56:54,927",A message? Sure.
1004,"00:56:54,929","00:56:57,297",When have I ever let you down?
1005,"00:56:57,299","00:56:59,933",All I hear day after day is:
1006,"00:56:59,935","00:57:03,303","""Oh, Barry,
you're such a disappointment."
1007,"00:57:03,305","00:57:05,238","""Why can't you be
more like your brother?"
1008,"00:57:05,240","00:57:07,907","He eats poachers
for a living, you know."""
1009,"00:57:07,909","00:57:11,111","""Yes, Mother, I know!"
1010,"00:57:11,113","00:57:13,782","The whole jungle knows."""
1011,"00:57:14,883","00:57:15,949","Oh, my head."
1012,"00:57:15,951","00:57:17,984",Your migraines are brought on
1013,"00:57:17,986","00:57:19,986",by severe maternal issues
1014,"00:57:19,988","00:57:21,388","and compounded
by sibling rivalry."
1015,"00:57:21,390","00:57:24,924",Please make it stop.
1016,"00:57:24,926","00:57:25,992","Oh, no, no, no, no."
1017,"00:57:25,994","00:57:28,028","- Lie down.
- Oh, my head."
1018,"00:57:28,030","00:57:31,998",We could resume your treatment.
1019,"00:57:32,000","00:57:34,134","Oh, the stress is unbearable."
1020,"00:57:34,136","00:57:37,204","I... I just want
to be a good boy."
1021,"00:57:37,206","00:57:40,073","I just want
to make Mummy proud."
1022,"00:57:40,075","00:57:41,342",There we are.
1023,"00:57:41,344","00:57:45,012","No one I eat
will ever be good enough."
1024,"00:57:45,014","00:57:47,914","There's the release.
Release it."
1025,"00:57:47,916","00:57:51,052",I will never be good enough.
1026,"00:57:51,054","00:57:53,954",Unless I eat you.
1027,"00:57:56,926","00:57:58,092","Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa."
1028,"00:57:58,094","00:58:01,095","Because every mother
wants their son"
1029,"00:58:01,097","00:58:03,665",to grow up and eat a doctor.
1030,"00:58:03,667","00:58:05,232",You're a sick kitty.
1031,"00:58:10,173","00:58:12,106","Come here, Doc.
I'll make it quick."
1032,"00:58:12,108","00:58:15,111","I've got another
one of these in an hour."
1033,"00:58:16,447","00:58:18,245","Give up, Dolittle."
1034,"00:58:18,247","00:58:19,514",You can't outsmart...
1035,"00:58:19,516","00:58:21,015","Oh, what was that?"
1036,"00:58:21,017","00:58:22,183","Oh, wait."
1037,"00:58:22,185","00:58:23,385","Now it's over there, huh?"
1038,"00:58:23,387","00:58:25,119",And now it's over here.
1039,"00:58:25,121","00:58:27,054","Now it's back over there.
Got it."
1040,"00:58:27,056","00:58:28,490",And now it's over here.
1041,"00:58:28,492","00:58:30,392","Oh, I lost it.
I've got to get it."
1042,"00:58:30,394","00:58:32,127",A cat is still a cat.
1043,"00:58:32,129","00:58:34,131","- I got it.
- Easily distracted."
1044,"00:58:35,265","00:58:37,065","New game, Doc."
1045,"00:58:37,067","00:58:39,368",Get back down here.
1046,"00:58:39,370","00:58:41,169","Come on down, Doc."
1047,"00:58:42,506","00:58:45,006","Okay, James,
you can't let this kid down."
1048,"00:58:45,008","00:58:46,441","You got to deliver
this message."
1049,"00:58:46,443","00:58:48,711","Oh, no. It's James."
1050,"00:58:48,713","00:58:53,115","From now on, no more focusing
on relationships and..."
1051,"00:58:53,117","00:58:55,083",Whoa. Poly?
1052,"00:58:55,085","00:58:56,552","- Is that you?
- James?"
1053,"00:58:56,554","00:58:59,555","- Ooh, your feathers really filled out nice.
- James, James!"
1054,"00:58:59,557","00:59:02,057","- What happened, James?
- Oh, right. Message."
1055,"00:59:02,059","00:59:03,325",My bad.
1056,"00:59:03,327","00:59:05,060","The kid's been captured
by Rassouli,"
1057,"00:59:05,062","00:59:07,195","and Barry's about to have
Dolittle for lunch."
1058,"00:59:07,197","00:59:09,197","Looks like we're going ashore
after all."
1059,"00:59:09,199","00:59:11,501","Be a darling and grab
my dynamite, will you?"
1060,"00:59:14,037","00:59:17,540","We need to split up if
we're going to pull this off."
1061,"00:59:17,542","00:59:19,409","Chee-Chee,
you're coming with me."
1062,"00:59:19,411","00:59:21,411","Where are we going?
No, no, no, don't tell me."
1063,"00:59:21,413","00:59:23,112",Just tell me when we get there.
1064,"00:59:23,114","00:59:26,115","Yoshi, create a distraction."
1065,"00:59:26,117","00:59:27,952",Hope this is enough.
1066,"00:59:33,458","00:59:35,026",We are being attacked!
1067,"00:59:41,299","00:59:43,166","Come on down, Doc."
1068,"00:59:43,168","00:59:44,434",Therapy's the answer.
1069,"00:59:44,436","00:59:46,770","Oh, no.
Worse than I expected."
1070,"00:59:51,042","00:59:54,143","- I got you, Doc.
- Back off, Barry!"
1071,"00:59:54,145","00:59:56,346","Poly, don't!"
1072,"00:59:56,348","00:59:58,181",An appetizer.
1073,"01:00:00,619","01:00:01,785","I got you, Poly."
1074,"01:00:05,191","01:00:07,157","Any final diagnosis, Doc?"
1075,"01:00:07,159","01:00:09,193","Don't you want to be
the best Barry you could be?"
1076,"01:00:09,195","01:00:12,095","Oh, I'm about to."
1077,"01:00:12,097","01:00:14,467",I am not a prisoner of fear!
1078,"01:00:18,237","01:00:20,204",I'm not a prisoner of fear?
1079,"01:00:20,206","01:00:21,505","Oh, no, no, no, no, no."
1080,"01:00:21,507","01:00:23,340",It's okay to be scared.
1081,"01:00:23,342","01:00:25,142","- Ow, ow.
- Oh, oh!"
1082,"01:00:28,481","01:00:30,247",It's okay to be scared.
1083,"01:00:30,249","01:00:32,182","- You should be scared.
- It's okay to be scared!"
1084,"01:00:34,186","01:00:36,488","- Give him a good hiding.
- Okay, we're doing this."
1085,"01:00:36,490","01:00:38,322",We are doing this.
1086,"01:00:38,324","01:00:40,257",We're not doing this.
1087,"01:00:43,563","01:00:46,397",Hit him in the low area.
1088,"01:00:46,399","01:00:49,099",Down there.
1089,"01:00:49,101","01:00:50,170",Ah.
1090,"01:00:53,540","01:00:55,540","Ooh, that's got to hurt."
1091,"01:00:55,542","01:00:57,141",Ow! My Barry berries.
1092,"01:00:57,143","01:00:58,142",That will work.
1093,"01:01:00,113","01:01:01,346","Cheap shot, ape."
1094,"01:01:04,284","01:01:06,351",Wait. I...
1095,"01:01:06,353","01:01:10,121","I haven't finished
my treatment."
1096,"01:01:11,658","01:01:14,359","♪ Go to sleep, baby tiger ♪"
1097,"01:01:14,361","01:01:17,328","♪ Time to put
those claws away. ♪"
1098,"01:01:18,431","01:01:20,166",Anyway...
1099,"01:01:21,268","01:01:23,636",You need this more than I do.
1100,"01:01:23,638","01:01:26,672","Tell me I'm enough, Mummy."
1101,"01:01:26,674","01:01:29,475",I had 50 grand riding on that.
1102,"01:01:29,477","01:01:32,143","Well, I won't pay that."
1103,"01:01:32,145","01:01:35,181","Ladies and gentlemen,
we have a winner."
1104,"01:01:36,651","01:01:39,120","Thanks for sticking
with me, Doc."
1105,"01:02:02,209","01:02:03,275",I have it.
1106,"01:02:03,277","01:02:05,681","- I have the j...
- Stop! - Halt!"
1107,"01:02:08,517","01:02:11,118",And now I'll have it.
1108,"01:02:13,455","01:02:14,588",Hmm.
1109,"01:02:17,626","01:02:20,225",She had such a sure hand.
1110,"01:02:20,227","01:02:23,463","Exactly what
the doctor ordered."
1111,"01:02:27,636","01:02:29,502","What did they offer you,
Mudfly,"
1112,"01:02:29,504","01:02:31,239",to murder the queen of England?
1113,"01:02:32,441","01:02:34,441","Quite a few things, actually."
1114,"01:02:34,443","01:02:35,709",Knighthood.
1115,"01:02:35,711","01:02:37,444",Windward House.
1116,"01:02:37,446","01:02:39,212",Chair of the Royal College.
1117,"01:02:39,214","01:02:41,514",In no particular order.
1118,"01:02:41,516","01:02:44,551","Oh, and the icing
on the madeleine"
1119,"01:02:44,553","01:02:47,520","will be the scientific
accolades that accrue"
1120,"01:02:47,522","01:02:50,691","from the proper study
of the Eden Tree."
1121,"01:02:50,693","01:02:53,460",All thanks to Lily Dolittle.
1122,"01:02:53,462","01:02:56,262","Actually, no,
that's still madeleine."
1123,"01:02:56,264","01:03:01,303","The icing is knowing
that you know I won."
1124,"01:03:04,741","01:03:08,976","Oh, and, Dolittle, I'm so sorry
for that hole in your boat."
1125,"01:03:08,978","01:03:10,279",What hole?
1126,"01:03:20,289","01:03:21,691","Abandon ship!
Everyone, overboard!"
1127,"01:03:26,295","01:03:28,462","Oh, not good."
1128,"01:03:33,569","01:03:35,236",Don't look back.
1129,"01:03:36,572","01:03:38,572",Help!
1130,"01:03:38,574","01:03:40,443","I'm on it, Doc."
1131,"01:03:41,779","01:03:43,812",I can't fly.
1132,"01:03:43,814","01:03:46,215",And I can't swim.
1133,"01:03:50,319","01:03:52,319","Got you, buddy."
1134,"01:03:52,321","01:03:53,789","Plimpton,
I'm not losing you, bro."
1135,"01:03:53,791","01:03:55,590",Step away from the light.
1136,"01:03:55,592","01:03:56,825",There is no light.
1137,"01:03:56,827","01:03:58,026",I'm alive.
1138,"01:03:58,028","01:03:59,594",I'm alive.
1139,"01:03:59,596","01:04:03,665","I'm alive,
thanks to you, Yoshi."
1140,"01:04:26,658","01:04:29,359",You've always been so kind.
1141,"01:04:32,597","01:04:35,430",It's difficult to say goodbye.
1142,"01:04:35,432","01:04:38,468",Please don't say that.
1143,"01:04:38,470","01:04:40,572",It's all right.
1144,"01:04:43,842","01:04:46,342",You've done your best.
1145,"01:04:46,344","01:04:48,513",Your queen is proud.

1147,"01:04:57,489","01:04:59,822","Hey, big bird, you doing okay?"
1148,"01:04:59,824","01:05:01,557",No.
1149,"01:05:01,559","01:05:03,626",Nothing about me is okay.
1150,"01:05:03,628","01:05:05,829",My father was right about me.
1151,"01:05:05,831","01:05:07,931",I should have been an omelet.
1152,"01:05:07,933","01:05:10,100",I know how you feel.
1153,"01:05:10,102","01:05:13,603","My dad said he was going out
for a pack of seals one night"
1154,"01:05:13,605","01:05:16,106",and never came back.
1155,"01:05:16,108","01:05:19,475","I guess we got something
in common after all, Plimpton."
1156,"01:05:19,477","01:05:21,645",What is this feeling?
1157,"01:05:21,647","01:05:25,582",I'm all warm and fuzzy inside.
1158,"01:05:25,584","01:05:27,818","That's friendship, bro."
1159,"01:05:27,820","01:05:29,353",Huh.
1160,"01:05:29,355","01:05:31,855",Not bad... bro.
1161,"01:05:35,528","01:05:37,828",I'm not crying. You're crying.
1162,"01:05:51,844","01:05:53,777","Right.
Gather round, shall we?"
1163,"01:05:53,779","01:05:56,446","Huh? Let's have a look
where we are now."
1164,"01:05:56,448","01:05:58,317","That's the spirit, John."
1165,"01:06:01,922","01:06:04,758","Oh, this is gonna be good."
1166,"01:06:06,660","01:06:07,727",I'm already getting duck bumps.
1167,"01:06:10,964","01:06:13,498","- We are finished.
- What?"
1168,"01:06:13,500","01:06:14,599",Is this a pep talk?
1169,"01:06:14,601","01:06:15,867",'Cause it's a weird one.
1170,"01:06:15,869","01:06:19,470","I can sniff defeat
like a truffle pig."
1171,"01:06:19,472","01:06:21,472",This can't be the end.
1172,"01:06:21,474","01:06:22,941","- Yeah.
- We..."
1173,"01:06:22,943","01:06:24,943","- I smell it.
- We can still save the queen."
1174,"01:06:24,945","01:06:26,778","- Nope.
- We can still save your house."
1175,"01:06:29,482","01:06:31,482",I believe in you.
1176,"01:06:31,484","01:06:32,750",We can keep going.
1177,"01:06:32,752","01:06:34,485","Oh, you got a point there."
1178,"01:06:34,487","01:06:35,720","Except the journal's gone,"
1179,"01:06:35,722","01:06:37,789","we have no way to find
the Eden Tree,"
1180,"01:06:37,791","01:06:39,024",and our boat is sunk.
1181,"01:06:39,026","01:06:40,895",He makes a strong argument.
1182,"01:06:42,729","01:06:45,663","On the plus side,
you are all cured."
1183,"01:06:45,665","01:06:47,565","Chee-Chee, you are brave now."
1184,"01:06:47,567","01:06:49,869","Plimpton and Yoshi
are getting along."
1185,"01:06:49,871","01:06:51,770","Ow! Remember, back! Back!"
1186,"01:06:51,772","01:06:52,972",Sort of.
1187,"01:06:52,974","01:06:54,773","And, Stubbins,
you've made friends,"
1188,"01:06:54,775","01:06:56,642",and you can even talk to 'em.
1189,"01:06:56,644","01:06:58,443",You don't need me.
1190,"01:06:58,445","01:07:00,813","I'll stay here
and offer medical services"
1191,"01:07:00,815","01:07:03,649","to this island
of random bandits and outlaws."
1192,"01:07:03,651","01:07:04,917",The doctor's here!
1193,"01:07:04,919","01:07:06,619",Seeking new patients.
1194,"01:07:06,621","01:07:08,520","- Cash only.
- Ladies, gentlemen,"
1195,"01:07:08,522","01:07:10,223",who'd like to dance?
1196,"01:07:10,225","01:07:12,691","I got a bad case
of dancing fever."
1197,"01:07:12,693","01:07:14,793","So, watch out, it's infectious."
1198,"01:07:14,795","01:07:16,462",Ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-cha!
1199,"01:07:16,464","01:07:17,963","- Come on, Doc.
- Can't help him."
1200,"01:07:17,965","01:07:19,932","That explorer
you told me about..."
1201,"01:07:19,934","01:07:21,800",she would have never given up.
1202,"01:07:21,802","01:07:23,769","She was your wife, wasn't she?"
1203,"01:07:23,771","01:07:25,571","You want to know
the ironic bit?"
1204,"01:07:25,573","01:07:29,475","I don't know
what ""ironic"" means."
1205,"01:07:29,477","01:07:32,779",Irony is when you find a woman
1206,"01:07:32,781","01:07:34,080","and she makes your life
more wonderful"
1207,"01:07:34,082","01:07:35,882","than it had any right to be,"
1208,"01:07:35,884","01:07:39,518","and then, poof, she's gone,
and it's all your fault."
1209,"01:07:39,520","01:07:43,558","This journey was my chance
to finish what she started."
1210,"01:07:46,528","01:07:48,962","Lily insisted I care
for the animals at home,"
1211,"01:07:48,964","01:07:51,498",so I stayed behind.
1212,"01:07:51,500","01:07:53,066",Rassouli's right.
1213,"01:07:53,068","01:07:54,801",I should have been with her.
1214,"01:07:54,803","01:07:57,704","Now all I have left of her
is the ghost I see"
1215,"01:07:57,706","01:07:59,572",when I hold our rings.
1216,"01:07:59,574","01:08:01,743","So, you see her, too?"
1217,"01:08:05,013","01:08:08,982","Not only did you lose
my daughter's journal..."
1218,"01:08:10,719","01:08:13,853","...but your polar bear
blew up my village."
1219,"01:08:13,855","01:08:14,956",No.
1220,"01:08:14,958","01:08:16,991",We don't know that.
1221,"01:08:16,993","01:08:21,561","And your gorilla
beat up my tiger."
1222,"01:08:21,563","01:08:23,066",No good.
1223,"01:08:26,869","01:08:29,570","- Let's go.
- No, no. Stay."
1224,"01:08:29,572","01:08:30,773","No, no, no, no, no."
1225,"01:08:31,941","01:08:34,777",Mm. Yeah.
1226,"01:08:39,983","01:08:42,616",Irony...
1227,"01:08:42,618","01:08:46,053",is me wanting to kill you
1228,"01:08:46,055","01:08:49,092",with every fiber of my being...
1229,"01:08:52,028","01:08:56,666",...but loving my daughter more.
1230,"01:09:06,010","01:09:07,845","I miss her, too."
1231,"01:09:10,914","01:09:13,782",She would have wanted you to...
1232,"01:09:13,784","01:09:15,619",to keep going.
1233,"01:09:23,660","01:09:25,796",So!
1234,"01:09:28,032","01:09:30,366",Get going...
1235,"01:09:30,368","01:09:32,734","before I stop feeling
sentimental."
1236,"01:09:36,807","01:09:38,809","She's saying
we don't have a ship."
1237,"01:09:40,044","01:09:42,111","Well, uh..."
1238,"01:09:42,113","01:09:44,882","I have the perfect vessel
for you."
1239,"01:09:47,684","01:09:49,152",Bit of a fixer-upper.
1240,"01:09:49,154","01:09:51,220",It's got good bones.
1241,"01:09:51,222","01:09:52,288",At least it floats.
1242,"01:09:52,290","01:09:55,958","We'll just have to make
the best of it, won't we?"
1243,"01:09:55,960","01:09:58,027",Ooh! Company.
1244,"01:09:58,029","01:10:00,029","Uh, who's that?"
1245,"01:10:00,031","01:10:01,397",Hi.
1246,"01:10:01,399","01:10:02,732",I'm Jeff.
1247,"01:10:02,734","01:10:04,903",Crikey.
1248,"01:10:07,038","01:10:09,839","If Lily's research was correct,"
1249,"01:10:09,841","01:10:13,943","then Mudfly was well on his way
to Eden Tree Island."
1250,"01:10:13,945","01:10:16,979","All we needed to do
was track Mudfly."
1251,"01:10:16,981","01:10:18,815",But how do we do that?
1252,"01:10:18,817","01:10:21,017","Whales, boyo."
1253,"01:10:21,019","01:10:22,987",Whales.
1254,"01:10:39,138","01:10:41,171","I can't believe
you're flipping him off."
1255,"01:10:41,173","01:10:43,741","I know.
That man has no chin."
1256,"01:10:53,152","01:10:54,753",Ah.
1257,"01:11:12,004","01:11:14,874",We found him. Follow us.
1258,"01:11:24,050","01:11:26,253",Eden Tree Island.
1259,"01:11:43,503","01:11:45,303","- Yeah!
- Oh, wow."
1260,"01:11:45,305","01:11:49,007","- Wow.
- Extraordinary."
1261,"01:12:03,056","01:12:04,956",This must be it.
1262,"01:12:04,958","01:12:10,262","The map points us directly into
the center of this mountain."
1263,"01:12:10,264","01:12:12,131",Don't look down.
1264,"01:12:12,133","01:12:14,200","Let's keep our beaks up,
shall we?"
1265,"01:12:14,202","01:12:15,767",Trying to stay positive.
1266,"01:12:15,769","01:12:17,203","What the heck
are we doing up here?"
1267,"01:12:17,205","01:12:20,072","Going in the back way,
my feathered buddy."
1268,"01:12:20,074","01:12:21,840",What are you complaining about?
1269,"01:12:21,842","01:12:23,976","This is the widest branch
I've ever scurried on."
1270,"01:12:23,978","01:12:25,277",Don't look down.
1271,"01:12:25,279","01:12:27,079",Look at me.
1272,"01:12:27,081","01:12:29,081",Whoa.
1273,"01:12:29,083","01:12:31,719",A big cave.
1274,"01:12:36,257","01:12:38,023",Stay close. Keep quiet.
1275,"01:12:38,025","01:12:39,825","Kevin's log, day 12."
1276,"01:12:39,827","01:12:41,260","Some force
beyond my comprehension"
1277,"01:12:41,262","01:12:44,129","still compels me to follow
this crew of lunatics,"
1278,"01:12:44,131","01:12:46,865","the squirrel killer
and their deranged leader."
1279,"01:12:46,867","01:12:49,369","Perhaps it's the magic tree
that draws me."
1280,"01:12:49,371","01:12:51,271","- Rifle troop! Fall in!
- Hide. They're close."
1281,"01:12:51,273","01:12:54,041",Turn it down now. Stay down.
1282,"01:13:04,386","01:13:06,855",Fox fire fungus.
1283,"01:13:07,923","01:13:09,825",We must be near it now.
1284,"01:13:12,294","01:13:14,294","Look, Doc."
1285,"01:13:14,296","01:13:16,363","It's lighting a path
all the way..."
1286,"01:13:16,365","01:13:18,898",to the man who wants us dead.
1287,"01:13:18,900","01:13:20,900",Stay right there.
1288,"01:13:20,902","01:13:22,836",Oh.
1289,"01:13:22,838","01:13:25,071","Go on, then, soldier boy.
Spoil yourself."
1290,"01:13:29,878","01:13:32,178","Hello, Blair."
1291,"01:13:34,049","01:13:35,249",Get over there!
1292,"01:13:35,251","01:13:37,152","Looking for a tree, is it?"
1293,"01:13:38,421","01:13:41,188","Trees don't often grow
in caves."
1294,"01:13:41,190","01:13:42,956","Didn't you pay attention
in botany class?"
1295,"01:13:42,958","01:13:46,062","No, but pay attention
to this, Dolittle."
1296,"01:13:47,330","01:13:49,930",I beat you.
1297,"01:13:49,932","01:13:53,067",You filthy animal...
1298,"01:13:53,069","01:13:54,468","Move it. Come on, beasts."
1299,"01:13:54,470","01:13:56,973",...hoarder!
1300,"01:13:59,208","01:14:01,175",So...
1301,"01:14:01,177","01:14:02,910",where is it?
1302,"01:14:02,912","01:14:04,245",Where's what?
1303,"01:14:05,415","01:14:07,081",The Eden Tree.
1304,"01:14:07,083","01:14:10,351","Truth is, I haven't got a clue."
1305,"01:14:10,353","01:14:11,886",Don't be ridiculous.
1306,"01:14:11,888","01:14:13,287",You're John Dolittle.
1307,"01:14:13,289","01:14:15,890",You get everything you want.
1308,"01:14:15,892","01:14:17,361","Not today, I don't."
1309,"01:14:19,062","01:14:22,196","You really don't have
any idea, do you?"
1310,"01:14:22,198","01:14:25,367",How does ignorance feel?
1311,"01:14:25,369","01:14:27,369",Oh.
1312,"01:14:27,371","01:14:29,970","Well, very freeing, actually."
1313,"01:14:29,972","01:14:33,108","One must hug uncertainty,
don't you think?"
1314,"01:14:33,110","01:14:35,377",That's how Lily lived her life.
1315,"01:14:37,481","01:14:39,214","Embrace the unknown, and..."
1316,"01:14:39,216","01:14:42,117",the answers will be revealed.
1317,"01:14:42,119","01:14:46,221","You sad, misguided nut,
Dolittle."
1318,"01:14:46,223","01:14:47,858","Give that to me.
Give me that."
1319,"01:14:50,461","01:14:54,096","I will find this damn tree
on my own,"
1320,"01:14:54,098","01:14:58,133","and by God,
history will remember me."
1321,"01:15:09,179","01:15:12,281","Yeah. Something interesting
going on now."
1322,"01:15:17,522","01:15:21,023","My God, that feels
a lot larger than all of us."
1323,"01:15:23,194","01:15:25,161",Let's go!
1324,"01:15:25,163","01:15:27,296","- What is that?
- Something's moving!"
1325,"01:15:28,366","01:15:29,968",Look out!
1326,"01:15:34,139","01:15:37,173",Retreat!
1327,"01:15:37,175","01:15:38,742",Down over here!
1328,"01:15:38,744","01:15:41,177",The lot of you! Come on!
1329,"01:15:41,179","01:15:43,281","Yoshi, stay down."
1330,"01:15:44,382","01:15:45,982",He saved me.
1331,"01:15:45,984","01:15:48,050",I have a second chance
1332,"01:15:48,052","01:15:52,356","to live a life of-of kindness
and-and-and generosity and..."
1333,"01:15:57,363","01:15:59,095","Take him, not me!"
1334,"01:15:59,097","01:16:01,231",I'm a good person now.
1335,"01:16:25,324","01:16:27,324","Tell you what we're gonna do...
we're gonna make a run"
1336,"01:16:27,326","01:16:28,392","for that ditch
while she's distracted..."
1337,"01:16:30,362","01:16:32,062","- Yoshi!
- Get this off of me!"
1338,"01:16:32,064","01:16:33,096",Cheech.
1339,"01:16:33,098","01:16:34,599",Help me! Plimpton!
1340,"01:16:34,601","01:16:36,300","I'll save you, bro."
1341,"01:16:36,302","01:16:38,168",Right. Think fast. Uh...
1342,"01:16:38,170","01:16:41,106",Get this off of me!
1343,"01:16:42,642","01:16:44,411","This will likely
upset her a bit."
1344,"01:16:46,379","01:16:48,045",No! Doc!
1345,"01:16:48,047","01:16:49,581","- No! - No!
- John!"
1346,"01:16:49,583","01:16:52,219",Dolittle!
1347,"01:17:05,365","01:17:06,397",Dolittle!
1348,"01:17:06,399","01:17:07,665",Help!
1349,"01:17:19,246","01:17:21,379",Is he speaking dragon?
1350,"01:17:23,383","01:17:28,387","You may be able
to speak my language,"
1351,"01:17:28,389","01:17:32,691","but that does not make you
worthy of the fruit."
1352,"01:17:32,693","01:17:35,361","I know protecting the tree's
your duty,"
1353,"01:17:35,363","01:17:38,264","but you won't be able
to continue much longer..."
1354,"01:17:38,266","01:17:39,698","considering
the damage you've taken"
1355,"01:17:39,700","01:17:41,400",and the pain you're in.
1356,"01:17:41,402","01:17:46,539","Oh, you know
nothing of my pain."
1357,"01:17:51,245","01:17:53,345",But I do.
1358,"01:17:53,347","01:17:55,481",I've felt it as well.
1359,"01:17:55,483","01:17:58,384","The kind that doesn't come
from a bullet or a blade,"
1360,"01:17:58,386","01:18:00,121",but cuts much deeper.
1361,"01:18:01,455","01:18:04,323","And now in every moment
and every movement,"
1362,"01:18:04,325","01:18:06,325",you feel that pain again.
1363,"01:18:06,327","01:18:08,394",Yeah?
1364,"01:18:11,567","01:18:14,133",It's hard to carry on...
1365,"01:18:18,540","01:18:21,208","...when you've lost
the one you love."
1366,"01:18:35,223","01:18:38,360",Just leave!
1367,"01:18:45,334","01:18:47,233","Uh, what just happened?"
1368,"01:18:47,235","01:18:48,703","Oh, broken hearts."
1369,"01:18:48,705","01:18:50,370","What the heck
are you doing here?"
1370,"01:18:50,372","01:18:51,571","Don't worry, guys.
I got this."
1371,"01:18:51,573","01:18:53,306",We're both dragons.
1372,"01:18:53,308","01:18:56,544","Hey, just wondering,
you know, dragon to dragon,"
1373,"01:18:56,546","01:18:58,244","if you wouldn't mind
telling me where..."
1374,"01:18:58,246","01:19:00,481","Ow, ow, ow!
She's really mad."
1375,"01:19:00,483","01:19:02,783","I'll wait for
whoever survives outside."
1376,"01:19:02,785","01:19:05,786","John, let's just get
out of here while we still can."
1377,"01:19:05,788","01:19:07,488",No.
1378,"01:19:07,490","01:19:09,323",I think we're here to help her.
1379,"01:19:11,661","01:19:13,461",Yeah.
1380,"01:19:13,463","01:19:15,630","- We haven't got much time.
- Hmm?"
1381,"01:19:15,632","01:19:18,766","I-I imagine
it's a bit tender here."
1382,"01:19:20,637","01:19:22,269",Oh...
1383,"01:19:22,271","01:19:24,672",I'm unarmed.
1384,"01:19:24,674","01:19:27,274",I pose no threat to you.
1385,"01:19:27,276","01:19:29,276","The emotional stress
over the years"
1386,"01:19:29,278","01:19:30,544","has done damage
to your stomach."
1387,"01:19:30,546","01:19:32,546",Get away from me.
1388,"01:19:32,548","01:19:35,383","You have a severe
impaction of the colon,"
1389,"01:19:35,385","01:19:38,319","and if I don't manually
fragment it, it'll go septic."
1390,"01:19:38,321","01:19:41,322","You won't be able to protect
anything anymore."
1391,"01:19:41,324","01:19:44,693","Ooh, that sounds like
some tummy ache."
1392,"01:19:44,695","01:19:46,528","Tell you what,
give us five minutes."
1393,"01:19:46,530","01:19:48,797","If you don't feel better,
you can fry us all."
1394,"01:19:48,799","01:19:50,732",Stop talking.
1395,"01:19:50,734","01:19:53,669",Just get on with it.
1396,"01:19:53,671","01:19:56,471","We have to get you
on your side."
1397,"01:19:56,473","01:19:58,707","We need to perform
an emergency extraction."
1398,"01:19:58,709","01:20:00,742","Extraction?
Uh, what are we pulling out?"
1399,"01:20:00,744","01:20:03,445","- Go get 'em, gang.
- Got your back, Doc."
1400,"01:20:03,447","01:20:05,580",It's showtime.
1401,"01:20:05,582","01:20:07,649","Three, two, one."
1402,"01:20:07,651","01:20:09,551",Turn.
1403,"01:20:11,022","01:20:12,854","Chee-Chee,
chuck me the forceps."
1404,"01:20:12,856","01:20:15,557","Knew it would come in handy.
Told you!"
1405,"01:20:15,559","01:20:16,859",Everybody knows what to do.
1406,"01:20:16,861","01:20:18,660",Just breathe. Works for me.
1407,"01:20:18,662","01:20:21,296","It's okay. Just hold on
to my wing, sweetie."
1408,"01:20:21,298","01:20:22,464",Dab-Dab's here.
1409,"01:20:22,466","01:20:23,498",Oi.
1410,"01:20:23,500","01:20:24,566",You are my apprentice.
1411,"01:20:24,568","01:20:26,303",You keep her calm.
1412,"01:20:28,305","01:20:31,541","Did you know the leek is
the national emblem of Wales?"
1413,"01:20:31,543","01:20:33,341","And very useful it is, too."
1414,"01:20:33,343","01:20:35,343","You might feel
a bit of pressure."
1415,"01:20:35,345","01:20:37,347",I got her.
1416,"01:20:38,817","01:20:40,450","Oh, good heavens!"
1417,"01:20:40,452","01:20:41,617","Oh, no, you didn't."
1418,"01:20:41,619","01:20:43,486","Oh, my gosh!"
1419,"01:20:43,488","01:20:45,388",Just clearing the way.
1420,"01:20:45,390","01:20:47,557",Is that armor?
1421,"01:20:47,559","01:20:50,228","You got the whole
Spanish army in here."
1422,"01:20:51,763","01:20:52,895",Give us a deep breath.
1423,"01:20:52,897","01:20:54,430",Hold it.
1424,"01:20:54,432","01:20:55,498",Word of warning.
1425,"01:20:55,500","01:20:56,599","What's up, Doc?"
1426,"01:20:56,601","01:20:58,367",When removing the blockage...
1427,"01:20:58,369","01:20:59,736","Yoshi, now."
1428,"01:20:59,738","01:21:02,805","...there may be an initial
release of wind."
1429,"01:21:09,547","01:21:11,915",Ach-ah-vee!
1430,"01:21:11,917","01:21:13,483",Respect.
1431,"01:21:13,485","01:21:15,418","It's all right.
Nobody heard that."
1432,"01:21:15,420","01:21:17,588",Nothing to be ashamed of.
1433,"01:21:17,590","01:21:18,922",We all do it.
1434,"01:21:18,924","01:21:21,091",We're all animals.
1435,"01:21:21,093","01:21:23,093",I can taste it!
1436,"01:21:23,095","01:21:24,695","- Okay, I'm back.
- Right."
1437,"01:21:24,697","01:21:26,897","What did I miss? Oh, my gosh!"
1438,"01:21:26,899","01:21:28,699",This is the big one.
1439,"01:21:28,701","01:21:30,400",We're in the homestretch now.
1440,"01:21:30,402","01:21:31,535","Cheech, get behind me."
1441,"01:21:31,537","01:21:32,870","I'm with you, Doc.
On your call."
1442,"01:21:32,872","01:21:34,605",Heave!
1443,"01:21:36,776","01:21:38,675","Oh, it's breaching."
1444,"01:21:38,677","01:21:41,411","Blood rushing to my head.
Everything turning red."
1445,"01:21:41,413","01:21:43,814","One last push, madam,
if you please."
1446,"01:21:56,595","01:21:58,129",Thank you.
1447,"01:21:59,665","01:22:00,765",We did it.
1448,"01:22:00,767","01:22:02,432",Teamwork makes the dream work.
1449,"01:22:03,804","01:22:06,671","That was a lot,
but we did good."
1450,"01:22:10,442","01:22:11,943","To put it simply,"
1451,"01:22:11,945","01:22:15,547","more leafy greens
and less armor in your diet."
1452,"01:22:16,983","01:22:21,920","I've seen armies of every kind,
but nothing like you."
1453,"01:22:21,922","01:22:26,591","What unites
such a group of creatures?"
1454,"01:22:26,593","01:22:30,728","Well, we may not look it,
right, but somehow..."
1455,"01:22:30,730","01:22:33,598","- Who's a good boy? Good boy.
- ...we just belong together."
1456,"01:22:33,600","01:22:36,903",Now let me help you.
1457,"01:22:54,421","01:22:56,454","Lily would have loved it, John."
1458,"01:22:56,456","01:22:58,724","We would never have found it
without her."
1459,"01:22:58,726","01:23:03,364","Wow. I just got the chills,
and I'm not even cold."
1460,"01:23:27,655","01:23:30,591","Thank you for showing me
the way, my love."
1461,"01:23:36,965","01:23:38,765","We know, O Lord, that there is"
1462,"01:23:38,767","01:23:41,533",no word impossible to thee;
1463,"01:23:41,535","01:23:45,705","and that, if thou wilst,
thou canst yet raise her up"
1464,"01:23:45,707","01:23:48,942","and restore her to a longer
continuance amongst us."
1465,"01:23:48,944","01:23:51,778","O Father of mercies
and Lord of all comfort..."
1466,"01:23:51,780","01:23:54,681","I'm sorry we couldn't save you,
Your Majesty."
1467,"01:23:54,683","01:23:57,019","...her disillusion
draweth near."
1468,"01:23:59,054","01:24:01,621",It is with great sadness...
1469,"01:24:01,623","01:24:02,989","Wait a minute.
I smell something."
1470,"01:24:02,991","01:24:04,624",It smells like...
1471,"01:24:07,796","01:24:08,662",Hope.
1472,"01:24:08,664","01:24:10,597",...that I have to announce...
1473,"01:24:12,035","01:24:13,867",...that the queen is no more.
1474,"01:24:13,869","01:24:15,970",Somebody call a doctor?
1475,"01:24:15,972","01:24:17,972","My mates!
A very dramatic entrance, boys."
1476,"01:24:17,974","01:24:19,706",Well played.
1477,"01:24:19,708","01:24:21,742","- We've arrived.
- Dolittle!"
1478,"01:24:21,744","01:24:23,711","Clear a path.
There isn't a moment to waste."
1479,"01:24:27,650","01:24:30,818","I have procured that which
is said to not exist."
1480,"01:24:30,820","01:24:33,690","Behold, the fruit
of the Eden Tree."
1481,"01:24:35,792","01:24:38,025",I said clear a path.
1482,"01:24:38,027","01:24:39,627",Seize them!
1483,"01:24:40,897","01:24:42,964",Sorry but... sorry.
1484,"01:24:46,836","01:24:48,871",I got him!
1485,"01:24:50,740","01:24:52,740","- Go.
- Seize them!"
1486,"01:24:53,977","01:24:55,712",You were born for this moment.
1487,"01:24:56,746","01:24:57,812",I born.
1488,"01:24:59,649","01:25:01,116","Mini, take flight."
1489,"01:25:01,118","01:25:02,918",Get him!
1490,"01:25:02,920","01:25:03,952",Freeze!
1491,"01:25:03,954","01:25:06,021","Go, go, go!"
1492,"01:25:08,125","01:25:09,659",No.
1493,"01:25:11,862","01:25:12,796","No, no, no, no!"
1494,"01:25:55,006","01:25:57,639","Kevin's log, day unknown."
1495,"01:25:57,641","01:25:59,108",The killing has ended.
1496,"01:25:59,110","01:26:00,943",Let there be life.
1497,"01:26:00,945","01:26:02,814",Lady Rose.
1498,"01:26:05,083","01:26:08,951","Is there a giraffe
in my bedchamber?"
1499,"01:26:08,953","01:26:10,686","Yes. Oh, yes."
1500,"01:26:10,688","01:26:13,689","And a polar bear
and a gorilla and a parrot"
1501,"01:26:13,691","01:26:15,625","and a duck, an ostrich."
1502,"01:26:18,196","01:26:22,698",Our humble thanks be to God.
1503,"01:26:22,700","01:26:25,768","And well done, Dr. Dolittle."
1504,"01:26:25,770","01:26:28,704","Not quite done, are we?"
1505,"01:26:28,706","01:26:31,208","Interesting.
Carry on, Styx. I'm all ears."
1506,"01:26:31,210","01:26:33,177",What's that?
1507,"01:26:33,179","01:26:35,678","Uh, Styx here agreed
to stay behind,"
1508,"01:26:35,680","01:26:37,147",keep his 12 eyes on things.
1509,"01:26:37,149","01:26:39,149",He's just catching me up.
1510,"01:26:39,151","01:26:40,783","Like all leaf insects,"
1511,"01:26:40,785","01:26:42,986","he speaks in
eight-syllable phrases,"
1512,"01:26:42,988","01:26:45,655",and he states...

did poison the queen."""
1514,"01:26:48,127","01:26:49,960",What? He did?
1515,"01:26:49,962","01:26:53,063","Really,
Dolittle, this is too much."
1516,"01:26:53,065","01:26:54,098",You're certain?
1517,"01:26:54,100","01:26:56,266","Well, this would be the time."
1518,"01:26:56,268","01:27:00,170","No. I'm sorry.
Styx is quite adamant."

before they fly away."
1529,"01:27:23,964","01:27:25,762",Let's have a look.
1530,"01:27:28,767","01:27:30,767",Ooh.
1531,"01:27:35,175","01:27:36,908",No one messes with my family.
1532,"01:27:36,910","01:27:39,277","Take one more step, and I'll
rip you a brand-new a..."
1533,"01:27:39,279","01:27:41,047",Come on.
1534,"01:27:42,315","01:27:43,948",Get...
1535,"01:27:43,950","01:27:45,218",Hah.
1536,"01:27:46,820","01:27:48,786",To the Tower with him.
1537,"01:27:48,788","01:27:51,990","Oh, someone's been a bad boy."
1538,"01:27:51,992","01:27:53,791",Come on.
1539,"01:27:53,793","01:27:56,027","And I don't know why
you're all standing there."
1540,"01:27:56,029","01:27:58,163","Nobody's died.
Leave me in peace."
1541,"01:27:58,165","01:27:59,964","You, too."
1542,"01:27:59,966","01:28:01,233",Your Majesty.
1543,"01:28:02,236","01:28:04,738","Not you, Dr. Dolittle."
1544,"01:28:05,839","01:28:07,807","A moment, if you would, please."
1545,"01:28:10,044","01:28:12,978","Lady Rose, who is this person,
and why is he staring at me?"
1546,"01:28:12,980","01:28:14,714",He's Stubbins.
1547,"01:28:15,983","01:28:18,783","I-I want to be
an animal doctor."
1548,"01:28:18,785","01:28:20,753",He saved your life.
1549,"01:28:32,233","01:28:33,933",Thank you.
1550,"01:28:33,935","01:28:35,803","It's good to have you back,
Doctor."
1551,"01:28:40,542","01:28:41,474",Poly.
1552,"01:28:41,476","01:28:44,043","Anything
you'd like to say to me?"
1553,"01:28:44,045","01:28:45,345","Aye, you were right."
1554,"01:28:45,347","01:28:47,880","I suppose it is nice
to get out of the house"
1555,"01:28:47,882","01:28:49,148",every once in a while.
1556,"01:28:49,150","01:28:50,783","Stubbins, Mini."
1557,"01:28:50,785","01:28:53,852","Enough. We have far less
important places to be."
1558,"01:29:02,863","01:29:05,999","Our story ends
the way it began."
1559,"01:29:06,001","01:29:08,868","I have a letter
for Dr. Dolittle!"
1560,"01:29:08,870","01:29:10,036",Somebody get me down!
1561,"01:29:10,038","01:29:11,304",Mostly.
1562,"01:29:11,306","01:29:14,274","There once was
a peculiar doctor..."
1563,"01:29:17,012","01:29:20,280","...who found he was
at his best when sharing"
1564,"01:29:20,282","01:29:22,849",his extraordinary ability...
1565,"01:29:22,851","01:29:25,185","- ...with others.
- Excellent."
1566,"01:29:25,187","01:29:28,356","Soon, Dr. Dolittle
reopened his gates,"
1567,"01:29:28,358","01:29:31,359",as Lily would have wanted.
1568,"01:29:31,361","01:29:33,994","Three more in the queue, gang."
1569,"01:29:33,996","01:29:36,162",Copy that.
1570,"01:29:36,164","01:29:39,400","Dolittle discovered his
place in the world once again."
1571,"01:29:46,908","01:29:50,177","After all,
it's only by helping others"
1572,"01:29:50,179","01:29:53,249","that we can truly
help ourselves."
