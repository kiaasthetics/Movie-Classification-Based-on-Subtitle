1,"00:02:12,008","00:02:13,509",Goal!
2,"00:03:24,205","00:03:26,332","What was that? Ellie, did you hear that?"
3,"00:03:26,541","00:03:28,876","I heard it, Manny.
Whatever it is, it's miles away."
4,"00:03:29,043","00:03:30,378","Peaches, are you all right?"
5,"00:03:30,920","00:03:31,921",Where is she?
6,"00:03:32,171","00:03:34,173",No teenager is ever up early.
7,"00:03:35,258","00:03:37,468","Easy warden, she's not on lockdown."
8,"00:03:42,140","00:03:44,517","You two were supposed to be
responsible uncles!"
9,"00:03:44,600","00:03:47,812","What? I didn't see Peaches sneak off
maybe 15 or 20 minutes ago."
10,"00:03:47,895","00:03:50,064",Or that she went with Louis to the falls.
11,"00:03:50,148","00:03:52,316",The falls? Where the delinquents go?
12,"00:03:52,400","00:03:54,485","Relax, it's just where the kids hang out."
13,"00:03:54,569","00:03:57,280","No, no, it's a gateway hangout."
14,"00:03:57,363","00:04:00,074","First it's the falls,
then she's piercing her trunk..."
15,"00:04:00,158","00:04:02,326","and the next thing you know,
she's addicted to berries."
16,"00:04:02,618","00:04:05,872",Manny! You are overreacting.
17,"00:04:06,038","00:04:08,332","She's not going to be
your little girl forever."
18,"00:04:08,499","00:04:11,669",I know. That's what worries me.
19,"00:04:14,338","00:04:15,339",Come on!
20,"00:04:18,217","00:04:19,260",Louis!
21,"00:04:19,343","00:04:22,722","Would you get your head out of the ground
for once and try to have a little fun?"
22,"00:04:24,807","00:04:28,019","I'm a molehog.
My head's supposed to be underground."
23,"00:04:28,102","00:04:32,315","And my idea of fun isn't risking death
so that you can meet some cute mammoth."
24,"00:04:32,398","00:04:35,610",Ethan isn't cute. He's hot.
25,"00:04:36,569","00:04:39,405","Besides, you can't spend your whole life
playing it safe."
26,"00:04:39,489","00:04:41,157","- I know I would.
- Dad?"
27,"00:04:41,824","00:04:43,451",There's no reason to be mad.
28,"00:04:43,618","00:04:46,329","You know how I feel
about you going to the falls."
29,"00:04:46,412","00:04:47,622",Especially alone.
30,"00:04:47,789","00:04:49,373","She's not alone, sir."
31,"00:04:49,540","00:04:50,708","You don't count, Weiner."
32,"00:04:50,875","00:04:53,294","Yes, there's my place,
and you just put me in it, thank you."
33,"00:04:53,377","00:04:54,378","Come on, young lady."
34,"00:04:54,587","00:04:56,798","We're going home
where I can keep an eye on you."
35,"00:04:59,217","00:05:03,471","So, should I just wait here, or..."
36,"00:05:21,197","00:05:23,616","Yeah, you don't scare me, Mother Nature!"
37,"00:05:23,783","00:05:26,953","There's nothing you can throw at me
that I can't handle."
38,"00:05:31,207","00:05:32,250",I think we're almost there!
39,"00:05:32,416","00:05:34,961",We had better be! I just lost the steering.
40,"00:05:38,881","00:05:41,843","Has anyone seen Precious?
It's her feeding time."
41,"00:05:42,009","00:05:45,012","Mom! Granny's talking about
her dead pet again."
42,"00:05:45,179","00:05:47,181","Hey, paws up, everybody!"
43,"00:05:47,765","00:05:51,018","Paws down, Uncle, please! That is nasty."
44,"00:05:55,189","00:05:57,900","Be careful, Milton,
you're going to hurt somebody!"
45,"00:05:58,860","00:05:59,861",Bad kitty!
46,"00:05:59,944","00:06:00,945",Rock!
47,"00:06:12,456","00:06:16,168","Okay, so tell me, when exactly
will I be allowed to hang out with boys?"
48,"00:06:16,335","00:06:20,131","When I'm dead, plus three days.
Just to make sure I'm dead."
49,"00:06:37,148","00:06:38,983","Manny, are you okay?"
50,"00:06:41,444","00:06:45,156",Get off... my face!
51,"00:06:46,157","00:06:50,453","That was fun. Now, who should I eat first?"
52,"00:06:51,537","00:06:52,705","No, no, no!"
53,"00:06:55,458","00:06:58,377",Uncle Fungus! Could that really be you?
54,"00:06:58,878","00:07:00,046","Sorry, sorry."
55,"00:07:01,047","00:07:02,381","Mom, Dad!"
56,"00:07:04,133","00:07:05,134",Marshall!
57,"00:07:05,217","00:07:06,344","- Hey!
- Granny?"
58,"00:07:06,469","00:07:08,846",This pumpkin's ripe for picking!
59,"00:07:09,013","00:07:10,681",My whole familia.
60,"00:07:10,848","00:07:12,850",See? He still hugs his parents.
61,"00:07:13,017","00:07:17,897","I never thought I'd see my little baby again.
We've been searching everywhere for you."
62,"00:07:18,064","00:07:19,106",You have?
63,"00:07:19,190","00:07:22,401","I knew it, I knew it!
Deep down, I knew I wasn't abandoned!"
64,"00:07:23,319","00:07:25,446",That's incorrect. We totally abandoned you.
65,"00:07:25,529","00:07:30,242",But we always missed you. Right?
66,"00:07:30,409","00:07:32,036","Yeah, yeah, yeah."
67,"00:07:32,203","00:07:35,831","And we just knew Sid
would want to see his poor, dear Granny..."
68,"00:07:35,998","00:07:38,709",before her time is up.
69,"00:07:38,876","00:07:42,046",I'll bury you all and dance on your graves.
70,"00:07:42,213","00:07:43,255",So frail.
71,"00:07:43,339","00:07:46,592","And she can't wait
to spend time with you, Sid."
72,"00:07:46,759","00:07:50,179","Oh, yeah, Granny? Granny?"
73,"00:07:56,352","00:07:58,729","- Granny.
- I never get to have any fun."
74,"00:07:59,021","00:08:02,358","Why don't you show her your cave?
Yeah, she could use a nap."
75,"00:08:02,525","00:08:04,276","Boy, there's so much to tell you."
76,"00:08:04,443","00:08:06,362","A lot has happened
since the last time I saw you."
77,"00:08:06,529","00:08:07,780",Not interested.
78,"00:08:07,947","00:08:10,408",But we fought dinosaurs in the Ice Age.
79,"00:08:10,574","00:08:12,743","It didn't make sense,
but it sure was exciting."
80,"00:08:13,244","00:08:15,746",We got rid of the crazy bat! Let's go!
81,"00:08:18,040","00:08:19,875","Whoa, whoa, whoa! You can't just leave."
82,"00:08:20,042","00:08:21,252",Sid will be crushed.
83,"00:08:21,627","00:08:23,587","Sorry, cookie,
things are breaking apart back home."
84,"00:08:23,754","00:08:27,091","So, we're headed inland.
And Granny is just dead weight."
85,"00:08:27,258","00:08:29,051","- See you.
- Mush, mush!"
86,"00:08:29,802","00:08:34,265","And warn the community.
She tends to wander!"
87,"00:08:34,974","00:08:37,226","Well, that explains a lot about Sid."
88,"00:08:37,435","00:08:40,771","Mom, Dad, do you have Granny's teeth?
She can't find them."
89,"00:08:44,442","00:08:46,610",Hey! Can you chew this thing for me?
90,"00:08:47,278","00:08:50,031",Guys? Where is everyone?
91,"00:08:50,448","00:08:51,699",I'll handle this.
92,"00:08:53,451","00:08:54,535",Sid?
93,"00:08:55,953","00:08:58,080","Your family was wiped out by an asteroid.
Sorry."
94,"00:08:58,247","00:08:59,415",What?
95,"00:08:59,582","00:09:03,085",What Diego is trying to say is...
96,"00:09:03,627","00:09:05,087",they left.
97,"00:09:05,254","00:09:08,466","They only wanted to find you
so you could take care of Granny."
98,"00:09:08,632","00:09:13,262","Come on, what kind of sick family
would ditch their Granny on someone?"
99,"00:09:13,429","00:09:16,390",That's just crazy. That's just...
100,"00:09:16,974","00:09:18,434",That's just...
101,"00:09:19,477","00:09:20,686",...my family.
102,"00:09:21,979","00:09:24,565","At least you still have Granny.
Right, buddy?"
103,"00:09:24,732","00:09:27,401","Yeah, Granny. Granny?"
104,"00:09:27,860","00:09:28,903",Granny?
105,"00:09:28,986","00:09:31,781","Wow. For an old girl, she moves fast."
106,"00:09:36,160","00:09:37,912","- Granny?
- Granny."
107,"00:09:37,995","00:09:39,038",Granny?
108,"00:09:39,121","00:09:40,498","Come out, come out wherever you are!"
109,"00:09:40,581","00:09:41,582","Come on, Granny."
110,"00:09:41,665","00:09:46,087","Here, Granny, Granny.
I have prunes for you!"
111,"00:09:46,253","00:09:48,464",Just the way you like them!
112,"00:09:50,174","00:09:52,301",I don't want to see that.
113,"00:09:55,513","00:09:56,764","Oh, no."
114,"00:09:57,139","00:10:00,017","What if your dad finds out?
I'm not as tough as I look!"
115,"00:10:00,184","00:10:02,144","Wait, do you hear that?"
116,"00:10:10,152","00:10:11,445",Go long!
117,"00:10:15,533","00:10:16,575",Cool!
118,"00:10:17,118","00:10:18,619","Hey, look, there's Ethan."
119,"00:10:19,286","00:10:20,955","Yeah, Ethan!"
120,"00:10:21,122","00:10:22,373","You go, boy!"
121,"00:10:22,832","00:10:24,375",That was nice.
122,"00:10:26,168","00:10:27,378",Yeah!
123,"00:10:29,713","00:10:31,715","See? Fun, no danger."
124,"00:10:33,634","00:10:34,885",Check me out!
125,"00:10:41,809","00:10:45,521","- I'm sure he's fine.
- I'm completely not fine!"
126,"00:10:46,897","00:10:51,068",You did not just do that! That was crazy!
127,"00:10:51,485","00:10:52,570",Nice.
128,"00:10:52,653","00:10:54,029",Yeah!
129,"00:10:55,739","00:10:57,241",Isn't he perfect?
130,"00:10:57,324","00:11:00,870","""Perfect."" It's such a strong word.
Maybe ""adequate."""
131,"00:11:00,953","00:11:01,996",Who are we stalking?
132,"00:11:02,079","00:11:03,539",Is it Ethan? I bet it's Ethan.
133,"00:11:03,622","00:11:05,249","- Hey, Weiner.
- What are you guys doing here?"
134,"00:11:05,332","00:11:06,750",Manny told us to keep an eye on you.
135,"00:11:06,834","00:11:09,879","- But not to let you see us.
- Under any circumstances."
136,"00:11:10,754","00:11:13,549","Stupid, stupid, stupid."
137,"00:11:13,924","00:11:17,761","Okay, I'm going for it. Do I look okay?"
138,"00:11:18,095","00:11:19,096",Louis?
139,"00:11:20,598","00:11:23,559","""Okay"" doesn't even begin to cover it."
140,"00:11:24,226","00:11:27,438",Louis. You're the greatest friend ever!
141,"00:11:30,357","00:11:31,609",That's me.
142,"00:11:31,775","00:11:35,029","Hi, Ethan, my name's Peaches.
What's yours?"
143,"00:11:35,696","00:11:39,575","What am I doing?
Okay, just be cool, just be..."
144,"00:11:41,994","00:11:43,037",No!
145,"00:11:44,455","00:11:46,790",Yeah. That's intense!
146,"00:11:49,960","00:11:51,128",This hurts so much!
147,"00:11:52,630","00:11:55,424",No! No! No!
148,"00:12:00,554","00:12:04,725","Gross. It's that weirdo
who chills with possums!"
149,"00:12:05,517","00:12:06,936",What just happened?
150,"00:12:07,019","00:12:09,897","Oh, no! Ethan, I am so sorry."
151,"00:12:10,064","00:12:12,316","Wow, you're even better-looking up close."
152,"00:12:12,483","00:12:14,360",Phenomenal. I mean...
153,"00:12:15,027","00:12:16,946",You have a twin sister?
154,"00:12:17,112","00:12:18,822",Am I interrupting something?
155,"00:12:19,365","00:12:20,699","- Dad!
- Oh, boy. Okay..."
156,"00:12:20,783","00:12:21,867","Sorry, if I just..."
157,"00:12:21,951","00:12:24,161","- Wait, no, you go left.
- Just move back a bit."
158,"00:12:24,245","00:12:26,330",You! Keep away from my daughter.
159,"00:12:26,413","00:12:28,207","- Dad...
- And you, you're grounded!"
160,"00:12:28,290","00:12:29,875","- But I didn't do...
- Grounded!"
161,"00:12:29,959","00:12:31,377",Loser alert.
162,"00:12:31,543","00:12:33,254","Ouch, that's her dad."
163,"00:12:33,420","00:12:35,631","Seriously, that's embarrassing."
164,"00:12:35,714","00:12:36,757",What a freak.
165,"00:12:38,634","00:12:39,927",Peaches!
166,"00:12:43,931","00:12:45,849","Peaches, come on. Let's talk about this!"
167,"00:12:46,016","00:12:48,435","How could you embarrass me
in front of my friends?"
168,"00:12:48,602","00:12:51,730","You deliberately went
where you weren't supposed to!"
169,"00:12:51,897","00:12:53,482",You can't control my life!
170,"00:12:53,649","00:12:56,735","I'm trying to protect you!
That's what fathers do."
171,"00:12:56,902","00:12:59,989",Well... I wish you weren't my father.
172,"00:13:02,950","00:13:04,493","She's just upset, honey."
173,"00:13:05,077","00:13:07,871",Peaches! It's not the end of the world.
174,"00:13:13,335","00:13:15,087",Whoa. Excuse me.
175,"00:13:15,254","00:13:16,588",I don't think that was you.
176,"00:13:21,385","00:13:23,304","- What was that?
- I don't know."
177,"00:13:24,054","00:13:25,306",Stay there.
178,"00:13:25,556","00:13:26,974",I'll come to you.
179,"00:13:35,941","00:13:37,526","- Ellie!
- Manny!"
180,"00:13:39,528","00:13:40,863",No!
181,"00:13:42,781","00:13:44,658","- Dad!
- Peaches, get back!"
182,"00:13:52,833","00:13:53,959","Hurry, Dad! Hurry!"
183,"00:13:54,043","00:13:55,085",Manny!
184,"00:13:56,086","00:13:58,005","- Diego!
- You never would have made it!"
185,"00:14:11,226","00:14:12,978","Ellie, behind you!"
186,"00:14:13,145","00:14:14,313",What's happening?
187,"00:14:18,901","00:14:22,237","Go to the land bridge!
You'll be safe on the other side."
188,"00:14:22,446","00:14:23,655","No, Manny! No!"
189,"00:14:23,822","00:14:25,282",I'll meet you there!
190,"00:14:37,044","00:14:39,671",Manny! No!
191,"00:14:39,838","00:14:43,801","Ellie, you have to get out of here!
Go! Go now!"
192,"00:14:57,439","00:14:59,233","- Mom!
- Get back! Get back!"
193,"00:15:25,384","00:15:26,844",Daddy!
194,"00:15:28,929","00:15:31,515",Stay alive!
195,"00:15:31,682","00:15:36,603","No matter how long it
takes, I will find you!"
196,"00:15:36,770","00:15:40,107","Mom, this is all my fault.
If I had just listened..."
197,"00:15:40,274","00:15:42,651","Peaches! This is not your fault, okay?"
198,"00:15:42,818","00:15:46,071","What if I never see him again?
And the last thing we did was fight."
199,"00:15:46,238","00:15:50,701","Hey, your father is the toughest,
most stubborn mammoth I've ever met."
200,"00:15:50,868","00:15:53,871",He'll come back for us. That's a promise.
201,"00:15:59,835","00:16:02,212","Come on!
Help me turn this thing around!"
202,"00:16:11,889","00:16:15,726","Everyone, please, settle down. Don't panic!"
203,"00:16:16,435","00:16:19,271","Wait, Mom, where's Louis?
We have to find him."
204,"00:16:20,731","00:16:21,732","Okay, fast."
205,"00:16:30,199","00:16:31,992",They need me! We got to get back.
206,"00:16:32,075","00:16:35,537","Buddy, this thing's too big to turn.
The current's pulling us out."
207,"00:16:35,621","00:16:39,833","You know, my mother once told me that
bad news was just good news in disguise."
208,"00:16:39,917","00:16:41,502",Was this before she abandoned you?
209,"00:16:41,585","00:16:42,794","Yes, it was."
210,"00:16:42,878","00:16:46,006","But the point being that,
even though things look bad..."
211,"00:16:46,089","00:16:48,634",there's a rainbow around every corner...
212,"00:16:49,092","00:16:53,096",and nothing but smooth sailing ahead!
213,"00:16:57,100","00:16:58,393","Smooth sailing, Sid?"
214,"00:17:06,735","00:17:08,904","- Louis? Louis?
- Louis?"
215,"00:17:09,071","00:17:12,032",Weiner! Weiner! Weiner!
216,"00:17:12,199","00:17:15,118","Louis where are you?
Come on, we have to go."
217,"00:17:21,291","00:17:22,292",Louis?
218,"00:17:22,459","00:17:23,794",Peaches!
219,"00:17:25,796","00:17:27,965","Louis, you have to jump."
220,"00:17:29,132","00:17:31,176","No! Go, save yourselves."
221,"00:17:31,260","00:17:32,928",We're not leaving without you.
222,"00:17:33,011","00:17:34,012","Oh, thank goodness."
223,"00:17:34,096","00:17:35,138",Jump!
224,"00:17:40,811","00:17:43,188",This is why I travel underground.
225,"00:17:50,946","00:17:52,239",Thanks for coming back.
226,"00:17:52,322","00:17:55,242","What do you mean?
You don't leave a friend behind."
227,"00:17:55,784","00:17:57,995","Great, let's go."
228,"00:17:58,161","00:18:00,581","That wall is going to keep moving
and crush us."
229,"00:18:00,747","00:18:02,833",We need to get to the land bridge.
230,"00:18:03,000","00:18:04,042",Any questions?
231,"00:18:05,460","00:18:06,503",Yes?
232,"00:18:06,837","00:18:11,174","When you drink water through your trunk,
does it taste like boogers?"
233,"00:18:11,758","00:18:12,843",No.
234,"00:18:12,926","00:18:15,304","Well, sometimes. Let's move!"
235,"00:18:28,817","00:18:31,653",Just keep your eye on the horizon.
236,"00:18:31,737","00:18:34,197",I can't find the horizon.
237,"00:18:41,288","00:18:42,706",Holy crab!
238,"00:18:56,845","00:18:58,013",Hold me.
239,"00:18:59,723","00:19:01,058",If I don't make it...
240,"00:19:01,224","00:19:04,728","find me a wife, and tell her I love her."
241,"00:19:14,571","00:19:15,656",We made it!
242,"00:19:15,739","00:19:19,242","Come on, ocean,
is that the best you can do?"
243,"00:19:19,326","00:19:20,786","Am I right, buddy?"
244,"00:19:35,967","00:19:39,429","Hey, there really is a rainbow
around every corner!"
245,"00:19:56,405","00:19:57,948",Peaches!
246,"00:20:04,371","00:20:05,914",You Okay?
247,"00:20:06,164","00:20:07,958",I'm just so worried about my dad.
248,"00:20:08,125","00:20:09,835","Listen, we're going to get to him."
249,"00:20:10,001","00:20:11,670","At this pace, we'll stay
ahead of the wall..."
250,"00:20:11,837","00:20:14,005","and we'll make it to the land bridge
before you know it."
251,"00:20:15,340","00:20:17,634",We're all going to survive this.
252,"00:20:22,472","00:20:26,059","Okay, maybe they won't.
But everyone else, totally fine."
253,"00:20:47,497","00:20:49,875",We're still heading away from home.
254,"00:20:53,420","00:20:56,339","Yeah, but we survived,
and we still have each other."
255,"00:20:56,423","00:20:57,841","Things could be worse, right?"
256,"00:20:57,924","00:20:59,760","For once, he's actually right."
257,"00:20:59,843","00:21:02,179","We made it through storms
and tidal waves..."
258,"00:21:02,262","00:21:05,098",and a vicious assortment of seafood.
259,"00:21:05,640","00:21:07,017",What more can they hit us with?
260,"00:21:07,642","00:21:09,644","Trying to make me get up
if I don't want to get up."
261,"00:21:09,728","00:21:10,771",If I want to get up I'd get up.
262,"00:21:10,854","00:21:11,855",Hello?
263,"00:21:12,814","00:21:13,815",What the...?
264,"00:21:13,899","00:21:15,650","Dagnabbit, I'm trying to sleep!"
265,"00:21:15,817","00:21:17,319",Granny? You're alive!
266,"00:21:17,486","00:21:20,071","And can we say
how thrilled we are to see you?"
267,"00:21:20,238","00:21:23,074","Hey, fats, you want to get me out of here?"
268,"00:21:24,576","00:21:26,244","Hey, come on."
269,"00:21:26,411","00:21:29,039","Pretend I'm a dessert,
that should motivate you."
270,"00:21:32,542","00:21:35,462","I can't believe this.
You slept through that storm?"
271,"00:21:36,087","00:21:39,466","I slept through the comet
that killed the unicorns."
272,"00:21:40,258","00:21:42,093","Thanks for drawing my bath, Sidney."
273,"00:21:42,260","00:21:44,638","- Granny, grab my paw.
- No way."
274,"00:21:45,096","00:21:47,682",This is my first bath in decades.
275,"00:21:50,268","00:21:51,311",There's your proof.
276,"00:21:51,394","00:21:53,855",Quick! Somebody do something!
277,"00:21:57,818","00:21:59,945","- I got you, Granny.
- Get off of me!"
278,"00:22:02,280","00:22:03,406",Granny!
279,"00:22:06,993","00:22:08,995",What are you peeping toms all looking at?
280,"00:22:09,454","00:22:12,958","A lady can't take a bath in peace?
Eyeballing me like a rump roast."
281,"00:22:13,124","00:22:16,461","What's the life expectancy
for a female sloth?"
282,"00:22:16,962","00:22:19,381","She'll outlive us all,
you know that, right?"
283,"00:22:19,464","00:22:22,133","Yeah, the spiteful ones live the longest."
284,"00:24:34,641","00:24:37,894",How big is this ocean?
285,"00:24:38,520","00:24:41,982","Water, water, everywhere"
286,"00:24:42,649","00:24:45,193",Nor any drop to drink
287,"00:24:45,276","00:24:46,945","Well, except maybe that drop."
288,"00:24:51,199","00:24:53,910",That's a little... salty.
289,"00:24:54,077","00:24:58,164",Precious! Mommy's calling you.
290,"00:24:58,331","00:25:01,209","Precious! Come here, sweetie."
291,"00:25:01,376","00:25:03,420","Hey, lady, have you seen Precious?"
292,"00:25:03,586","00:25:06,006","If you mean the imaginary,
or perhaps deceased, pet..."
293,"00:25:06,089","00:25:09,759","that you keep searching for, no, I haven't."
294,"00:25:09,926","00:25:10,927","Guys, look."
295,"00:25:11,261","00:25:13,763","Where there's birds, there's land, right?"
296,"00:25:13,847","00:25:15,265","Hey, buddy, come here."
297,"00:25:17,559","00:25:18,935","No, wait, wait! Come back."
298,"00:25:20,937","00:25:22,188",Come back!
299,"00:25:33,908","00:25:36,286","It's a huge bounty, mon capitaine."
300,"00:25:36,453","00:25:40,123",Four passengers. Ripe for the taking.
301,"00:25:40,290","00:25:43,710","One very smelly, and one very plump."
302,"00:25:43,877","00:25:45,795",In my ocean?
303,"00:25:45,962","00:25:48,631",What a terrible turn of events.
304,"00:25:48,798","00:25:52,302",I love a terrible turn of events.
305,"00:26:03,313","00:26:06,566","Am I hallucinating,
or is that ice coming straight towards us?"
306,"00:26:06,733","00:26:09,652","Yeah, yeah, it's coming.
It sounds like there's animals on it."
307,"00:26:09,819","00:26:13,239","Yippee!
We're being rescued, we're being rescued!"
308,"00:26:13,364","00:26:14,657",I hear laughter.
309,"00:26:15,283","00:26:16,910",Must be a party cruise.
310,"00:26:41,726","00:26:43,728","Hey, they look fluffy."
311,"00:26:43,895","00:26:45,814",I get the big woolly one.
312,"00:26:49,567","00:26:50,944",Wow.
313,"00:26:53,029","00:26:55,281","Get ready to slice and dice, boys."
314,"00:26:55,448","00:26:56,950","- Knock it off, Squint.
- Hey!"
315,"00:26:57,117","00:26:58,409",Wait for Captain's orders.
316,"00:26:59,035","00:27:00,578","Ahoy, down there!"
317,"00:27:01,204","00:27:03,540",How lucky are you?
318,"00:27:03,706","00:27:06,793","You know these waters
are infested with pirates."
319,"00:27:06,960","00:27:08,503","Right, boys?"
320,"00:27:08,670","00:27:10,713",Glad we found you before they did.
321,"00:27:13,299","00:27:15,969","Captain Gutt, here to help."
322,"00:27:16,261","00:27:18,555","You know, that's a nice monkey."
323,"00:27:23,601","00:27:27,105","Look, we don't want any trouble.
We just need to get back to the continent."
324,"00:27:27,272","00:27:30,358",The continent? That pile of rubble?
325,"00:27:33,361","00:27:35,405","My family's there, so if you could just..."
326,"00:27:36,239","00:27:39,701",Your family? That is so sweet.
327,"00:27:39,868","00:27:43,788","I hope you said goodbye,
because there's no way back."
328,"00:27:43,955","00:27:47,292","Yes, there is.
Don't you remember, Captain?"
329,"00:27:47,458","00:27:50,837","You can sail to Switchback Cove
and catch the current back from there."
330,"00:27:51,004","00:27:53,214","It's like a steel trap, this noggin is."
331,"00:27:53,381","00:27:55,425","Thank you, Mister Flynn."
332,"00:27:57,135","00:27:59,179",See? I knew there was a way home.
333,"00:27:59,345","00:28:00,638",There is no home!
334,"00:28:02,807","00:28:04,309",There is only here.
335,"00:28:04,475","00:28:08,271","And here, your ship belongs to me."
336,"00:28:09,689","00:28:10,940",Battle stations!
337,"00:28:16,779","00:28:18,281",Fly the colors!
338,"00:28:21,284","00:28:25,413",Now surrender your ship or face my fury.
339,"00:28:25,538","00:28:27,123",Or face your furry what?
340,"00:28:27,373","00:28:29,751","Not ""furry,"" Fury!"
341,"00:28:29,918","00:28:31,336",Fire!
342,"00:28:34,797","00:28:36,799","Hit the mammoth, win a prize."
343,"00:28:37,383","00:28:39,010","Ding, ding, ding."
344,"00:28:39,344","00:28:40,887",Fire the starboard cannons.
345,"00:28:40,970","00:28:43,181",I love this job!
346,"00:28:43,264","00:28:44,432","Shira, fetch."
347,"00:28:44,515","00:28:45,892","Aye-aye, Captain."
348,"00:28:50,605","00:28:51,731",You almost made it.
349,"00:28:51,814","00:28:53,024",I don't fight girls.
350,"00:28:56,986","00:28:58,029",I can see why.
351,"00:28:58,947","00:29:00,531",Belly flop.
352,"00:29:02,367","00:29:03,409",Sid!
353,"00:29:03,493","00:29:05,495","Let's rumba, Tiny."
354,"00:29:05,787","00:29:07,288","Lights out, big fella."
355,"00:29:13,211","00:29:14,545",Manny!
356,"00:29:23,721","00:29:24,806",Hello.
357,"00:29:25,056","00:29:26,349","Hey, buddy."
358,"00:29:26,724","00:29:28,476",Welcome to the party.
359,"00:29:31,062","00:29:33,898","Let's see what kind of moves you got.
Dance, little Scrat fish!"
360,"00:29:34,065","00:29:35,650",Dance your coconuts off!
361,"00:29:37,151","00:29:38,820",Happy dance.
362,"00:29:42,657","00:29:44,492",Look at him.
363,"00:29:44,784","00:29:47,078",Where's my bootie? Has anyone seen it?
364,"00:29:47,245","00:29:48,871","Dude, it's right behind you."
365,"00:29:49,038","00:29:50,957",Where? Where's my bootie?
366,"00:29:51,124","00:29:52,583",I can't see it.
367,"00:29:52,750","00:29:54,419",It's all I can see.
368,"00:29:54,836","00:29:58,047","This is a lovely vacation.
Best I've ever had."
369,"00:29:58,715","00:30:00,133","Morning, sunshine."
370,"00:30:00,216","00:30:04,429","Let me be the first
to extend the hand of friendship."
371,"00:30:04,929","00:30:05,972",That's your foot.
372,"00:30:07,181","00:30:09,100","Nothing gets by you, does it?"
373,"00:30:09,183","00:30:10,435",What do you want?
374,"00:30:10,518","00:30:14,522","I bet you're feeling
lost, scared, confused."
375,"00:30:14,647","00:30:16,274",Allow me to explain.
376,"00:30:16,441","00:30:17,859","Help me out, boys."
377,"00:30:18,192","00:30:20,820",Captain's going to sing a shanty!
378,"00:30:21,946","00:30:23,781","Here you are on a boat
You're adrift, you're afloat"
379,"00:30:23,865","00:30:25,491",One might even say you're stuck
380,"00:30:25,658","00:30:27,910","Well, I don't want to gloat
But I would like to note"
381,"00:30:27,994","00:30:29,329",That you're in luck
382,"00:30:29,412","00:30:31,748","You've been saved by the ape
That rules these waters"
383,"00:30:31,998","00:30:33,708","So forget about
Your wives and daughters"
384,"00:30:34,000","00:30:37,003","First Mate introduce me to them, please"
385,"00:30:37,503","00:30:38,838","Aye-aye, Captain Gutt."
386,"00:30:39,505","00:30:41,466","- He's the big and scary
- Elegant yet hairy"
387,"00:30:41,632","00:30:43,593","- Fear-inspiring
- Years from retiring"
388,"00:30:43,760","00:30:45,636","- Looting, stealing
- Banana peeling"
389,"00:30:45,845","00:30:48,348",Undisputed Master of the Seas
390,"00:30:48,431","00:30:49,390","Oh, jeez."
391,"00:30:49,474","00:30:52,602","- That's me
- 'Tis he"
392,"00:30:52,685","00:30:53,686","Okay, okay."
393,"00:30:54,437","00:30:58,566","I'm a primate pirate pioneer
And these are my brave buccaneers"
394,"00:30:58,733","00:31:01,277","All of whom were once
Lost souls like you"
395,"00:31:01,444","00:31:02,445",It's true
396,"00:31:02,570","00:31:04,405","- He rescued us
- He saved our butts"
397,"00:31:04,614","00:31:06,407",For that we owe our lives to Gutt
398,"00:31:06,574","00:31:08,618",And assuming he doesn't kill you
399,"00:31:08,785","00:31:11,037","You will owe him, too"
400,"00:31:11,204","00:31:12,580",Kill them?
401,"00:31:12,747","00:31:14,457","Me? No, no."
402,"00:31:14,957","00:31:19,212","Well, at least not this
very large, useful mammoth."
403,"00:31:19,379","00:31:20,797","Hey, hands off."
404,"00:31:20,963","00:31:22,131",Anyway...
405,"00:31:22,298","00:31:24,384","Here we are on a ship
Moving at quite a clip"
406,"00:31:24,467","00:31:25,927",Through the ever-shifting ice
407,"00:31:26,260","00:31:27,261",Come along on a trip
408,"00:31:27,345","00:31:28,388","- That's a hint
- That's a tip"
409,"00:31:28,471","00:31:29,472",That's good advice
410,"00:31:30,390","00:31:34,310","In a world that's going under
To survive you must learn to plunder"
411,"00:31:34,477","00:31:36,604",Luckily that's my field of expertise
412,"00:31:36,687","00:31:37,688",He's the best.
413,"00:31:37,814","00:31:39,941","- He's a robbing, thieving
- We really should be leaving."
414,"00:31:40,108","00:31:41,901","- Weapon throwing
- We got to get going."
415,"00:31:42,068","00:31:44,070","- Sloth-slaying
- Wish we could be staying."
416,"00:31:44,237","00:31:45,905","Undisputed
Uncontested"
417,"00:31:46,072","00:31:48,074","- Monkey suited
- Yeah, you guessed it"
418,"00:31:48,241","00:31:50,660",Master of the seas
419,"00:31:50,743","00:31:51,744","Oh, please."
420,"00:31:51,828","00:31:53,913","- That's me
- 'Tis he"
421,"00:31:53,996","00:31:54,956","- It's who?
- It's you"
422,"00:31:55,039","00:31:56,082","Just testing, I knew."
423,"00:31:56,165","00:31:58,418",It's me
424,"00:31:58,501","00:31:59,836","Good shanty, sir."
425,"00:32:00,253","00:32:02,755","""Captain Gutt""? Really?"
426,"00:32:02,964","00:32:06,843","I have a little paunch, too,
but I wouldn't name myself after it."
427,"00:32:08,344","00:32:10,596",That's funny. You're a funny guy.
428,"00:32:10,763","00:32:12,849",But that's not how I got my name.
429,"00:32:13,015","00:32:14,976",These got me my name.
430,"00:32:15,143","00:32:16,811","- I don't get it.
- No?"
431,"00:32:16,978","00:32:18,354",Okay.
432,"00:32:18,438","00:32:19,856",Let me give you a visual aid.
433,"00:32:20,022","00:32:21,983",I just gently press here.
434,"00:32:22,442","00:32:26,863","- That tickles.
- And go down like this."
435,"00:32:27,488","00:32:30,199","And then your innards
become your outarde."
436,"00:32:32,702","00:32:33,870",I still don't get it.
437,"00:32:33,953","00:32:37,331","Look, as much as I'm tempted
to join a monkey..."
438,"00:32:37,540","00:32:41,377","the Easter Bunny
and a giant bag of pudding..."
439,"00:32:41,544","00:32:42,837",I'll pass.
440,"00:32:42,920","00:32:45,047","No one's going to stop me
from getting back to my family."
441,"00:32:46,090","00:32:48,342","I'm going to lambada
with your liver, buddy."
442,"00:32:49,427","00:32:50,678",Let me at him!
443,"00:32:52,180","00:32:57,310","That family is going to
be the death of you."
444,"00:32:57,727","00:32:59,479","First mate, jettison the deadweight."
445,"00:32:59,562","00:33:01,272","Aye-aye, sir. Prepare the plank!"
446,"00:33:01,439","00:33:02,899",Prepare the plank!
447,"00:33:03,065","00:33:04,525",Preparing the plank!
448,"00:33:07,361","00:33:09,155","What?
You want me to walk into the water?"
449,"00:33:09,238","00:33:13,034","I can't because I just ate less than
20 minutes ago, and you know the rule."
450,"00:33:13,117","00:33:14,452",That's a myth.
451,"00:33:14,535","00:33:16,829","Okay, as long as it's safe."
452,"00:33:19,415","00:33:21,292","- Wait!
- Thank goodness."
453,"00:33:21,459","00:33:23,336","Dump the Wench, too."
454,"00:33:24,420","00:33:26,297",Ladies first.
455,"00:33:26,422","00:33:28,382",Such a nice boy.
456,"00:33:28,466","00:33:31,135","Why can't you be more like him, Sidney?"
457,"00:33:31,219","00:33:33,095","Granny, no! Wait!"
458,"00:33:34,388","00:33:35,556",Manny!
459,"00:33:36,098","00:33:37,642",Get me to the vine.
460,"00:33:38,643","00:33:40,269","Yeah, yeah, got it."
461,"00:33:45,316","00:33:47,527",You all got some ugly goldfish.
462,"00:33:48,444","00:33:50,446","Come on, a little more."
463,"00:33:57,453","00:33:58,454",No!
464,"00:34:01,457","00:34:02,750",Extinct that mammoth.
465,"00:34:02,833","00:34:05,169","Come on, Manny, kick his monkey butt!"
466,"00:34:05,336","00:34:06,754",Look at you.
467,"00:34:06,837","00:34:09,799",Eleven tons of landlubber blubber.
468,"00:34:09,882","00:34:12,635","Hey, I'm not fat! I'm poufy."
469,"00:34:12,843","00:34:15,805","Too bad, Tubby. I could have used you."
470,"00:34:15,972","00:34:17,223","Ain't going to happen, Captain."
471,"00:34:24,981","00:34:26,649","I got you, Granny."
472,"00:34:26,816","00:34:28,734","Giddy up, let's go, let's go."
473,"00:34:34,991","00:34:37,243",Does anyone have floaties?
474,"00:34:41,205","00:34:43,165",No! No!
475,"00:34:43,332","00:34:45,001",My bounty!
476,"00:35:00,558","00:35:03,269","They sunk our battleship.
What are we going to do?"
477,"00:35:03,352","00:35:05,021",We're all going to drown.
478,"00:35:05,688","00:35:08,691","You're a sea creature, you idiot."
479,"00:35:09,317","00:35:10,860","Good point, sir."
480,"00:35:11,611","00:35:12,737","Should I fly the white, captain?"
481,"00:35:12,820","00:35:14,071",No!
482,"00:35:14,155","00:35:16,073","Wait, what about Shira?"
483,"00:35:16,157","00:35:18,242","- What about her?
- Yeah, what about her?"
484,"00:35:18,326","00:35:21,203","Anyone else want to play ""Captain""?"
485,"00:35:21,704","00:35:22,788",Good.
486,"00:35:22,872","00:35:26,292","Now come on, blubber-brain. Swim."
487,"00:35:28,002","00:35:31,464",Hey! Gutt! Flynn! Anyone there?
488,"00:35:31,547","00:35:33,007","Here, grab hold."
489,"00:35:33,382","00:35:36,052","No, go away. I'd rather drown."
490,"00:35:36,135","00:35:37,553",Whatever the lady wants.
491,"00:35:42,558","00:35:44,435",I said I didn't need your help.
492,"00:35:44,644","00:35:48,439","You're welcome.
So, care to join our scurvy crew?"
493,"00:35:50,274","00:35:52,234","Two sloths, a mammoth and a saber?"
494,"00:35:52,401","00:35:54,487",You guys are like the start of a bad joke.
495,"00:35:54,570","00:35:56,280",And we saved you.
496,"00:35:56,364","00:35:58,491","That makes you the punch line, kitty."
497,"00:35:59,408","00:36:01,243","Don't call me ""kitty."""
498,"00:36:01,327","00:36:03,079","Okay, I won't..."
499,"00:36:03,579","00:36:04,622",Kitty.
500,"00:36:04,705","00:36:06,374","If they kiss, I'm going to puke."
501,"00:36:06,457","00:36:08,918","What? Wait, no."
502,"00:36:25,893","00:36:27,520",Are we there yet?
503,"00:36:30,815","00:36:32,566","I don't think we're ever
going to get there."
504,"00:36:33,859","00:36:35,778",Maybe we should rest for a few hours.
505,"00:36:36,612","00:36:37,655",Thank you.
506,"00:36:41,575","00:36:42,743","Night, Ellie."
507,"00:36:50,918","00:36:52,545","I miss you, Dad."
508,"00:36:54,338","00:36:56,799","Well, that's something
you don't see every day."
509,"00:36:57,091","00:36:58,092",Ethan!
510,"00:36:58,175","00:36:59,468",Hi.
511,"00:37:02,221","00:37:03,514",I meant to do that.
512,"00:37:04,181","00:37:06,183",I've never seen a mammoth sleep like that.
513,"00:37:06,267","00:37:08,686","What? No, this just helps me think."
514,"00:37:09,311","00:37:12,732","It gets blood to the old noggin
and away from the old... whatever."
515,"00:37:15,317","00:37:18,612","Okay, that's a little weird."
516,"00:37:22,742","00:37:26,495","So, how are you doing, you know,
with all of this?"
517,"00:37:26,579","00:37:29,206","Honestly, a little scared."
518,"00:37:29,832","00:37:31,667","Okay, a lot scared."
519,"00:37:31,834","00:37:33,335",Everything we knew is gone.
520,"00:37:33,419","00:37:35,171","Yeah, I was pretty scared, too."
521,"00:37:35,254","00:37:39,091","I mean, not scared, but, like, concerned."
522,"00:37:40,760","00:37:42,011",Do you want to walk with me tomorrow?
523,"00:37:42,344","00:37:44,054",Try and get our minds off all this stuff.
524,"00:37:44,138","00:37:45,848",You want to walk with me?
525,"00:37:46,015","00:37:48,058",You did almost flatten me this morning.
526,"00:37:48,142","00:37:51,187","So, I figure it can't
really go worse than that, right?"
527,"00:37:52,229","00:37:53,272",Yeah.
528,"00:37:53,355","00:37:54,356",Just one thing.
529,"00:37:54,440","00:37:57,902","It's totally no big deal, but
you might want to lose the molehog."
530,"00:37:57,985","00:38:01,030","Louis? Yeah, sure, not a problem."
531,"00:38:05,493","00:38:06,994",Wow.
532,"00:38:07,787","00:38:09,371",Someone looks happy.
533,"00:38:10,247","00:38:11,749","Ethan's great, isn't he?"
534,"00:38:11,916","00:38:14,126","Baby, I know you like this one..."
535,"00:38:14,293","00:38:18,047","but just don't let anyone change
who you are, okay?"
536,"00:38:18,214","00:38:19,590",I know.
537,"00:38:22,468","00:38:23,844",You coming up?
538,"00:38:27,223","00:38:29,850","I think I'm going to sleep
down here tonight."
539,"00:38:30,017","00:38:31,227",Okay.
540,"00:38:31,811","00:38:33,062","Night, baby."
541,"00:38:33,479","00:38:34,814","Night, Mom."
542,"00:38:36,398","00:38:37,691","Good night, Dad."
543,"00:38:49,703","00:38:52,248","Hey, chew this sandwich for me."
544,"00:38:52,998","00:38:57,169","Granny, why didn't our family want us?
What's wrong with us?"
545,"00:38:57,461","00:39:00,965","They think we're screw-ups
and we can't do anything right."
546,"00:39:03,384","00:39:04,718",It's a rat!
547,"00:39:09,181","00:39:10,307",No! No!
548,"00:39:12,059","00:39:14,061","- Screw up.
- Oh, Sid!"
549,"00:39:15,187","00:39:17,106",We'll never make it home on this thing.
550,"00:39:17,648","00:39:21,026","Maybe you should have thought of that
before you capsized our berg, genius."
551,"00:39:21,110","00:39:22,278","Yeah, trying to escape."
552,"00:39:22,361","00:39:23,362","- Wimp!
- Whiner!"
553,"00:39:23,445","00:39:24,488","- Crybaby!
- Land!"
554,"00:39:24,572","00:39:26,115","Yeah, land! Wait, what?"
555,"00:39:26,198","00:39:27,533",Not her. There!
556,"00:39:28,367","00:39:29,785",Land!
557,"00:39:31,745","00:39:33,998",Everyone paddle. Paddle!
558,"00:39:59,064","00:40:01,692",Food! I missed you so much!
559,"00:40:01,859","00:40:04,653","Look at me, I've wasted away."
560,"00:40:11,410","00:40:14,204","Okay, snack time is over.
We got to build a raft."
561,"00:40:14,288","00:40:15,289",Manny.
562,"00:40:15,372","00:40:17,666","Wow, Shira must really hate building rafts."
563,"00:40:18,834","00:40:20,586",Go get her. She can help us get back.
564,"00:40:20,669","00:40:21,670",Shira!
565,"00:40:45,945","00:40:46,987",Gotcha!
566,"00:40:48,697","00:40:49,865",Whoa!
567,"00:40:56,538","00:40:57,539",Let go of me.
568,"00:40:57,623","00:40:59,500",Where do you think you're going?
569,"00:40:59,625","00:41:00,751",Whoa!
570,"00:41:02,503","00:41:04,380",Switchback Cove.
571,"00:41:04,630","00:41:06,173",It's the way home.
572,"00:41:07,132","00:41:08,300","Oh, no."
573,"00:41:08,384","00:41:11,512",You call this a ship you miserable runts?
574,"00:41:11,595","00:41:13,514","Yeah, you little runts. Get to work."
575,"00:41:13,597","00:41:17,184","Faster, you worthless, wormy
sons of sorry excuses..."
576,"00:41:17,267","00:41:18,852",for shark bait weevils!
577,"00:41:18,936","00:41:20,437","- What did he say?
- I don't know."
578,"00:41:20,813","00:41:23,857","Now get this chunk of ice
seaworthy by sundown..."
579,"00:41:23,941","00:41:26,402",or I will keelhaul the lot of you!
580,"00:41:29,113","00:41:30,155",So what do you think?
581,"00:41:30,489","00:41:33,075","Two words, anger management."
582,"00:41:33,575","00:41:35,327",I'm talking about the current.
583,"00:41:35,411","00:41:37,913",Diego's right. We found the way home.
584,"00:41:39,415","00:41:42,710","Yeah, that's great.
Too bad we don't have a ship."
585,"00:41:42,793","00:41:46,338",Sure we do. It's right there.
586,"00:41:46,422","00:41:48,507","Well, that's a flawless plan."
587,"00:41:48,966","00:41:51,927","You want to pirate a pirate ship
from pirates."
588,"00:41:52,177","00:41:53,762","It pains me to say this, but..."
589,"00:41:53,846","00:41:55,597","our prisoner has a point.
- Yeah, well..."
590,"00:41:55,681","00:41:59,560",Guys. The trees have ears.
591,"00:42:15,659","00:42:18,787","Wait a minute,
maybe we can help each other."
592,"00:42:20,497","00:42:23,125","Hey, little fellas. Hey, come on out."
593,"00:42:23,667","00:42:27,129","No, no, it's okay.
We're not going to hurt you."
594,"00:42:28,630","00:42:31,842","How about you and us
against the pirates, huh?"
595,"00:42:34,428","00:42:36,138","You got no idea what I'm saying, do you?"
596,"00:42:36,305","00:42:39,808","Okay, ship, me want."
597,"00:42:39,975","00:42:41,935","Yeah, nice try Jungle Jim."
598,"00:42:42,102","00:42:44,021",Go ahead make fun. He got it.
599,"00:42:49,526","00:42:50,861",Thank you.
600,"00:42:51,028","00:42:52,196",May I try?
601,"00:42:52,279","00:42:53,530","Yeah, knock yourself out."
602,"00:42:53,614","00:42:56,784","Okay, watch this."
603,"00:42:59,369","00:43:01,830","Sick sloths sip broth,
sick sloths sip broth."
604,"00:43:21,558","00:43:23,060",Ta-da!
605,"00:43:24,311","00:43:25,354","That, they got?"
606,"00:43:34,696","00:43:35,948","Yup, they're in."
607,"00:43:36,031","00:43:38,700","Great, we'll free your buddies
and we can all work together..."
608,"00:43:38,784","00:43:40,536",to kick a little pirate booty.
609,"00:44:00,472","00:44:02,224","Easy, kitty. Water."
610,"00:44:03,016","00:44:04,351",You need it.
611,"00:44:06,228","00:44:07,771",I don't need anything from you.
612,"00:44:07,855","00:44:10,524","Fine, die of thirst. That
will really show me."
613,"00:44:10,607","00:44:11,900",Wait.
614,"00:44:12,067","00:44:13,735",I'll take it.
615,"00:44:13,902","00:44:14,987",Thank you.
616,"00:44:15,237","00:44:18,907","You have a way of saying ""thank you""
that makes it sound like ""drop dead."""
617,"00:44:19,074","00:44:20,826",It's a gift.
618,"00:44:20,909","00:44:23,245","Well, you're pretty soft, for a saber."
619,"00:44:23,328","00:44:25,330","Excuse me, I am not soft."
620,"00:44:25,414","00:44:27,291",I happen to be a remorseless assassin.
621,"00:44:27,374","00:44:29,001",Diego-poo!
622,"00:44:29,084","00:44:30,961","Hey, I made you another coral necklace."
623,"00:44:31,044","00:44:32,880",He keeps losing them.
624,"00:44:35,841","00:44:38,594","Yeah, I think I'm starting to get
why you're not in a pack."
625,"00:44:38,677","00:44:40,846","Listen, I chose to leave
my pack, all right?"
626,"00:44:40,929","00:44:43,265","Congratulations, warrior princess."
627,"00:44:43,348","00:44:44,391",So did I.
628,"00:44:44,725","00:44:46,268","- Really?
- What?"
629,"00:44:46,351","00:44:49,021","Nothing, I just know how hard that is..."
630,"00:44:49,104","00:44:50,856",walking away from everything you know.
631,"00:44:51,064","00:44:54,026","Oh, great, are we going to
braid each other's fur now?"
632,"00:44:54,109","00:44:55,861",Funny. Really funny.
633,"00:44:55,944","00:44:57,613","Can I tell you the difference
between you and me?"
634,"00:44:57,696","00:44:59,448",I wouldn't still be wearing that necklace?
635,"00:45:00,699","00:45:03,327","No, we both
might have wanted out of pack life..."
636,"00:45:03,410","00:45:05,829","but at least I didn't trade
one pack for another."
637,"00:45:05,913","00:45:07,456",I got something more.
638,"00:45:07,539","00:45:09,291","Oh, yeah, what's that?"
639,"00:45:09,791","00:45:11,793","- A herd.
- What's the difference?"
640,"00:45:11,960","00:45:13,212",We have each other's backs.
641,"00:45:13,295","00:45:15,839",Gutt has my back. I'm his first mate.
642,"00:45:15,923","00:45:18,842","Really? Because I don't see Gutt
sending out any search parties for you."
643,"00:45:21,094","00:45:23,055","You know, you won't beat him."
644,"00:45:23,138","00:45:25,390",Your big furry friend over there?
645,"00:45:25,474","00:45:27,184",He has no idea what he's up against.
646,"00:45:27,267","00:45:29,311","Yeah, but neither does Gutt."
647,"00:45:29,811","00:45:32,231","Unwind the binds,
don't let go until we're all on board."
648,"00:45:32,314","00:45:36,318","Okay, we need precision timing
from everyone to get that ship."
649,"00:45:36,401","00:45:38,904","Half-pint, you got your end covered, right?"
650,"00:45:43,742","00:45:45,452","I'm going to take that as a ""yes."" Diego?"
651,"00:45:45,744","00:45:47,120",I'll free his little friends.
652,"00:45:47,204","00:45:48,205",Sid and Granny?
653,"00:45:48,413","00:45:50,082","Untie the ship, sir!"
654,"00:45:50,165","00:45:53,710","Right, unwind the vines,
and don't let go until we're all on board."
655,"00:45:53,794","00:45:55,754","We're relying on you, Sid. You got that?"
656,"00:45:55,837","00:45:57,589","Yes, sir. Totally focused, sir."
657,"00:45:57,673","00:45:58,757",Don't worry.
658,"00:45:58,840","00:46:02,636","It'll be easy since
we don't have to guard Shira any more."
659,"00:46:06,515","00:46:08,183","We need to move, now."
660,"00:46:08,267","00:46:10,269","Squint, batten down the hatches."
661,"00:46:10,352","00:46:12,104","Raz, hoist the anchor."
662,"00:46:12,187","00:46:14,314","And, Gupta, fly the colors."
663,"00:46:14,398","00:46:16,108","Of course, Captain."
664,"00:46:16,191","00:46:19,027","We're setting sail for vengeance, lads."
665,"00:46:19,653","00:46:21,196",I love vengeance.
666,"00:46:21,947","00:46:22,948",Captain!
667,"00:46:23,031","00:46:26,410","Shira! Oh, what a relief!"
668,"00:46:26,493","00:46:27,911",I thought we'd lost you.
669,"00:46:27,995","00:46:30,038",The mammoth. He washed ashore with me.
670,"00:46:30,122","00:46:31,873",What? He's here?
671,"00:46:32,791","00:46:36,420","Did you sink your fangs into him?
Did he beg for his life?"
672,"00:46:36,503","00:46:38,547","No, the saber took me down."
673,"00:46:39,548","00:46:41,508",You're a failure.
674,"00:46:41,591","00:46:46,763","I need warriors, and all I have
are kitty cats and bunny rabbits."
675,"00:46:47,055","00:46:49,391",And a seal and a kangaroo.
676,"00:46:50,475","00:46:54,479","You take the saber down, or you die trying."
677,"00:46:54,646","00:46:57,566",No excuses.
678,"00:46:57,733","00:46:59,401","Yes, Captain."
679,"00:46:59,484","00:47:00,485",Mr. Squint.
680,"00:47:00,569","00:47:01,611","Aye, sir."
681,"00:47:01,778","00:47:03,947",You're first mate now.
682,"00:47:04,323","00:47:06,950","Yo-ho-ho and a bottle of
cool with me, Captain."
683,"00:47:07,034","00:47:09,828","Out of my way, saber.
You answer to me now."
684,"00:47:09,911","00:47:11,830","Gutt, listen, he's coming for the..."
685,"00:47:48,617","00:47:50,327","Grab your weapons, mates!"
686,"00:47:54,456","00:47:56,124","Not the spoon, Flynn."
687,"00:47:57,751","00:47:58,835",Follow me!
688,"00:47:58,919","00:48:00,128","Yeah, let's do this."
689,"00:48:02,631","00:48:04,966",Let me at him! Yeah!
690,"00:48:10,639","00:48:13,433","Guys, that's not necessary, really."
691,"00:48:13,600","00:48:15,310","I love you, too, yeah."
692,"00:48:15,477","00:48:18,772","Get to the ship, don't screw up.
Get to the ship, don't screw up."
693,"00:48:18,939","00:48:22,984","- Unwind the vines.
- Don't let go."
694,"00:48:23,151","00:48:24,152",Unwind the vines.
695,"00:48:24,277","00:48:26,238","Don't let... Oh, yummo!"
696,"00:48:29,116","00:48:31,618","Sid, no! It's a lotus berry."
697,"00:48:31,785","00:48:33,078",It will paralyze you.
698,"00:48:33,161","00:48:35,622","Oh, please. I know my berries."
699,"00:48:36,081","00:48:37,082",Don't...
700,"00:48:37,165","00:48:38,208",swallow.
701,"00:48:38,291","00:48:42,170","See, I'm fine.
If there's one thing I know, it's berries."
702,"00:48:44,548","00:48:45,632",Uh-oh!
703,"00:49:15,662","00:49:17,539","Yeah, finally!"
704,"00:49:19,624","00:49:21,543",Who's the Easter Bunny now?
705,"00:49:28,550","00:49:30,469","- It worked, he bought it!
- Come on!"
706,"00:49:30,552","00:49:31,595","No, no!"
707,"00:49:31,887","00:49:33,138",It's been a diversion.
708,"00:49:33,221","00:49:35,265","I know, I'm having a blast."
709,"00:49:35,348","00:49:38,768","No, pinhead, they're stealing my ship."
710,"00:49:43,064","00:49:45,984","One thing, Sid. You couldn't do one thing?"
711,"00:49:46,067","00:49:47,777",Look at you.
712,"00:49:47,944","00:49:48,987","Sid, can you hear me?"
713,"00:49:49,070","00:49:50,071",Bye-bye.
714,"00:49:50,155","00:49:51,865","Say something, buddy."
715,"00:49:53,033","00:49:54,576",Let's get them!
716,"00:49:54,826","00:49:56,161",Let's go.
717,"00:49:58,580","00:49:59,623",The ship!
718,"00:49:59,706","00:50:02,709","Come on, we've got to catch it
before it hits open water!"
719,"00:50:07,589","00:50:09,341","Sorry. All right, I'll hold you higher."
720,"00:50:09,508","00:50:10,967",Sorry. Sorry.
721,"00:50:12,928","00:50:15,263","Say adieu, mammoth!"
722,"00:50:15,764","00:50:16,723",Adieu!
723,"00:50:16,806","00:50:17,849","Sorry, buddy."
724,"00:50:27,234","00:50:28,693","I'm coming, Sid."
725,"00:50:35,784","00:50:38,286",I got you! I got you! I got you!
726,"00:50:44,626","00:50:47,212","I'm coming for you, mammoth."
727,"00:51:01,101","00:51:02,310",Diego!
728,"00:51:02,602","00:51:03,645",Come on!
729,"00:51:07,148","00:51:08,400","Come on, move it!"
730,"00:51:20,203","00:51:21,246",Why are you doing this?
731,"00:51:21,329","00:51:24,082","You don't understand. I
don't have a choice."
732,"00:51:24,165","00:51:25,834","You don't have to live this way, Shira."
733,"00:51:25,917","00:51:27,252",You'll be safe with us.
734,"00:51:27,335","00:51:29,421","- We take care of each other.
- Diego!"
735,"00:51:29,713","00:51:32,674",I can't hold on much longer.
736,"00:51:33,466","00:51:34,551",Diego!
737,"00:51:34,634","00:51:36,094",Come with us.
738,"00:51:36,177","00:51:37,470",Come with me.
739,"00:51:49,858","00:51:50,900",What are you doing?
740,"00:51:50,984","00:51:52,319",I've got your back.
741,"00:52:17,302","00:52:20,305","So long, banana breath.
Thanks for the ship!"
742,"00:52:44,537","00:52:46,831","Oh, no, he's gone forever!"
743,"00:52:48,083","00:52:49,793",Oh! There he is.
744,"00:52:58,468","00:53:00,470",Shore leave is over.
745,"00:53:00,553","00:53:03,807",Get your sorry carcasses on board now.
746,"00:53:15,318","00:53:16,820","Gutt, I can explain."
747,"00:53:17,487","00:53:18,697",When this ends...
748,"00:53:18,780","00:53:22,033","I'll have a tiger's skin
hanging on my wall."
749,"00:53:23,243","00:53:25,787",I don't care whose.
750,"00:53:28,790","00:53:31,167",That mammoth has taken my ship...
751,"00:53:31,251","00:53:32,544",my bounty...
752,"00:53:32,627","00:53:35,505",and now the loyalty of my crew.
753,"00:53:35,630","00:53:38,550",I will destroy him...
754,"00:53:38,717","00:53:41,469",and everything he loves.
755,"00:54:25,638","00:54:28,141",Wait for it. Wait for it.
756,"00:54:38,651","00:54:39,778",That was awesome.
757,"00:54:39,861","00:54:40,904",Can I ask you guys something?
758,"00:54:41,321","00:54:43,239",How are you both so happy?
759,"00:54:43,323","00:54:45,366","Doesn't it weigh on you
that the world might be ending?"
760,"00:54:45,617","00:54:47,243",Can I tell him our secret?
761,"00:54:48,703","00:54:50,246",Come here. Come here.
762,"00:54:50,330","00:54:54,417","We're very, very stupid."
763,"00:54:58,171","00:55:01,549","But, still, you're not a teensy bit
concerned about..."
764,"00:55:01,633","00:55:04,260","I don't know, say, imminent death?"
765,"00:55:05,970","00:55:07,305",Beep.
766,"00:55:08,181","00:55:09,808",I'm going to go find Peaches.
767,"00:55:13,812","00:55:17,106","Guys, over here. Come on, it's a shortcut."
768,"00:55:17,190","00:55:18,608",You're going to love this.
769,"00:55:18,691","00:55:20,985","Come on, girls, let's have some fun."
770,"00:55:21,069","00:55:22,111",Wow!
771,"00:55:22,362","00:55:25,156","- This is so cool.
- It's like we're upside down."
772,"00:55:25,240","00:55:27,075",That is amazing.
773,"00:55:27,617","00:55:28,743",Echo!
774,"00:55:34,207","00:55:37,001","Too bad your molehog friend
isn't here, huh?"
775,"00:55:37,085","00:55:38,670","You're not really friends
with him, are you?"
776,"00:55:38,753","00:55:40,588","Yeah, come clean, Peaches."
777,"00:55:40,672","00:55:42,924","Are you friends
with that awkward little rodent or not?"
778,"00:55:43,466","00:55:44,509",I mean...
779,"00:55:44,592","00:55:47,262","Louis and I, we've hung out or whatever."
780,"00:55:47,679","00:55:50,849","But, no, we're not really friends-friends."
781,"00:55:50,932","00:55:52,058",Not friends?
782,"00:55:53,518","00:55:55,562",Louis! I...
783,"00:55:55,728","00:55:57,146",Busted.
784,"00:56:01,192","00:56:02,902",Good to know.
785,"00:56:02,986","00:56:04,404","Louis, wait."
786,"00:56:06,865","00:56:08,533",He even runs away like a loser.
787,"00:56:08,616","00:56:12,328","Whoa, Peaches, don't stress.
You're with us now."
788,"00:56:12,412","00:56:14,998","Yeah, stress is so stressful."
789,"00:56:15,081","00:56:18,668","Yeah, girl, if you're going to stress
about something, stress about your hair."
790,"00:56:18,751","00:56:22,422","I know, right?
This humidity, I can't stand it."
791,"00:56:25,967","00:56:28,094","Guys, we should get out of here."
792,"00:56:28,177","00:56:30,179",Are you kidding? This is epic!
793,"00:56:32,056","00:56:33,933",Go! Go! Go!
794,"00:56:39,856","00:56:41,274",Yeah!
795,"00:56:41,524","00:56:42,901",How sick was that?
796,"00:56:43,109","00:56:45,987","Yo, that was insane."
797,"00:56:46,154","00:56:49,032","Hey, Peach, loosen up! Have some fun."
798,"00:56:49,115","00:56:52,243","Fun, you call that fun? I'm out of here."
799,"00:56:52,327","00:56:54,662","Come on, do you really want to go back..."
800,"00:56:54,746","00:56:58,666","to hanging with a weird molehog freak
and give all of this up?"
801,"00:56:58,750","00:57:01,002","I mean, it's bad enough
that your family is half possum and..."
802,"00:57:01,085","00:57:02,170",Bad enough?
803,"00:57:02,337","00:57:05,590","There is nothing bad
about being part of my family."
804,"00:57:05,673","00:57:07,008",I like hanging by my tail.
805,"00:57:07,258","00:57:11,387","And if you geniuses are normal,
this species is going to end up extinct."
806,"00:57:11,888","00:57:15,099","Yeah, well, your species
is going to be extinct first."
807,"00:57:15,266","00:57:16,809",Burn!
808,"00:57:16,893","00:57:18,978","We're the same species, genius."
809,"00:57:19,062","00:57:21,648",What? Double burn.
810,"00:57:41,459","00:57:43,586","Hey, I can wiggle my toe again."
811,"00:57:43,670","00:57:47,048","The important one,
the little piggy who went to market."
812,"00:57:47,131","00:57:49,258",Wait! I'm talking again.
813,"00:57:49,342","00:57:52,887","I had so many things
trapped inside of me that I couldn't say."
814,"00:57:53,471","00:57:56,057","Like, ""Hey, I'm not dead!"""
815,"00:57:56,265","00:57:58,518","And, ""Why does a hurricane
have an eye but not an ear?"""
816,"00:57:58,685","00:58:02,438","I'll push him overboard.
You guys say it was an accident."
817,"00:58:02,605","00:58:05,358","I'm in. How about you, Diego? Diego?"
818,"00:58:05,984","00:58:07,610","Hey, relax, buddy!"
819,"00:58:07,860","00:58:10,863","Captain Crazy
and his floating petting zoo are history."
820,"00:58:10,947","00:58:13,825",Come on! We're finally heading home!
821,"00:58:13,908","00:58:14,993",I don't know what's wrong with me.
822,"00:58:15,076","00:58:17,912","I can't eat, can't sleep.
Maybe I'm coming down with something."
823,"00:58:19,872","00:58:21,749",I know what you've got.
824,"00:58:21,833","00:58:23,251",The L word.
825,"00:58:23,334","00:58:25,086","Yeah, leprosy."
826,"00:58:25,169","00:58:28,047","No, Sid, it's four letters."
827,"00:58:28,131","00:58:30,591","It starts With ""L,"" ends With ""E."""
828,"00:58:31,467","00:58:32,510",Lice!
829,"00:58:32,593","00:58:36,014","No, Diego, my friend, is in love."
830,"00:58:36,097","00:58:38,641","Oh, yeah! Love."
831,"00:58:39,100","00:58:41,144",You mean with the pirate? No.
832,"00:58:41,310","00:58:44,522","Shira's gotten under your skin.
Come on, admit it."
833,"00:58:44,605","00:58:46,774",A rugged saber like you.
834,"00:58:46,899","00:58:49,527",A more rugged saber like her.
835,"00:58:49,610","00:58:52,447","No, no, no. You guys are dead wrong."
836,"00:58:54,615","00:58:58,161","Denial is the clincher.
You're in love, pussy cat!"
837,"00:58:58,244","00:59:00,788","Diego and Shira
Sitting in a tree"
838,"00:59:00,872","00:59:03,207",K-I-S-S-I-N-G
839,"00:59:03,291","00:59:05,376","Real mature, guys. Real mature."
840,"00:59:05,543","00:59:08,421","Then comes marriage
Then comes a baby in the baby carriage"
841,"00:59:08,588","00:59:09,964",Sucking his thumb...
842,"00:59:12,675","00:59:14,469",Diego.
843,"00:59:18,973","00:59:22,101",Diego.
844,"00:59:22,393","00:59:23,770",Shira?
845,"00:59:24,145","00:59:26,564",I wanted to come with you.
846,"00:59:29,233","00:59:31,152",She's beautiful.
847,"00:59:31,235","00:59:32,820",Sid...
848,"00:59:32,904","00:59:37,075","I adore a sloth who cares
nothing about personal hygiene."
849,"00:59:37,158","00:59:38,826","That's me, baby."
850,"00:59:39,827","00:59:41,329",Granny.
851,"00:59:41,412","00:59:43,748","Come to me, Granny."
852,"00:59:46,250","00:59:48,002","Well, hello."
853,"00:59:48,377","00:59:52,715","The wrinklier the raisin,
the sweeter the fruit."
854,"00:59:52,799","00:59:54,383",Granny likey.
855,"00:59:54,467","00:59:56,594",Granny likey very much.
856,"00:59:59,055","01:00:02,725","- Guys, aren't you paying attention?
- Manny..."
857,"01:00:02,809","01:00:05,061","- Manny, are you there?
- Ellie?"
858,"01:00:05,144","01:00:07,021","We're over here, Manny."
859,"01:00:07,105","01:00:08,648","This way, Daddy."
860,"01:00:08,731","01:00:10,983",I really need you.
861,"01:00:11,234","01:00:13,277","I know, honey. Stay there."
862,"01:00:15,571","01:00:16,614",I'm coming.
863,"01:00:16,697","01:00:19,784","You were right, Manny.
You're always right."
864,"01:00:20,034","01:00:21,577","No, look, I was..."
865,"01:00:21,744","01:00:24,413",Wait a minute. Ellie would never say that.
866,"01:00:24,497","01:00:26,624",Manny? Manny.
867,"01:00:27,333","01:00:29,877","No, they're not real. They're monsters!"
868,"01:00:29,961","01:00:32,004",They're sirens. Don't listen to them!
869,"01:00:32,088","01:00:36,634","Who can take the sunrise
Sprinkle it with dew"
870,"01:00:38,469","01:00:41,472","No! They may look real, but they're not."
871,"01:00:41,681","01:00:43,391",They're going to destroy the ship.
872,"01:00:44,058","01:00:47,061","Come on, tiger. Swim with me."
873,"01:00:47,770","01:00:50,273",Sid...
874,"01:00:50,439","01:00:52,859",I have a snack for you.
875,"01:00:55,111","01:00:57,238","And she cooks, too."
876,"01:00:58,406","01:00:59,407","Sid, no!"
877,"01:01:15,548","01:01:17,175",Why are we kissing?
878,"01:01:17,258","01:01:19,427",Because cruises are romantic?
879,"01:01:22,180","01:01:24,265","Five more seconds
and we'd have been goners."
880,"01:01:25,224","01:01:26,267",Call me.
881,"01:02:35,878","01:02:37,546","Here, girl."
882,"01:02:38,422","01:02:41,259","Here, Precious."
883,"01:02:41,509","01:02:43,803",She thinks she finally found her pet.
884,"01:02:44,512","01:02:46,931",Good girl. Here you go.
885,"01:02:47,014","01:02:51,018","Granny, can't you throw imaginary food
to your imaginary pet?"
886,"01:02:53,104","01:02:55,064",Enough already.
887,"01:02:55,189","01:02:56,649",We need to keep a lookout for home.
888,"01:02:57,024","01:02:59,068","Ignore them, Precious."
889,"01:02:59,151","01:03:00,486",I do.
890,"01:03:10,705","01:03:12,331","You can't take your eyes off her
for one minute."
891,"01:03:12,415","01:03:14,041","Nope, it's like having a child."
892,"01:03:15,960","01:03:17,503",Only without any of the joy.
893,"01:03:17,586","01:03:18,921","Hey, brain trust..."
894,"01:03:19,130","01:03:20,339",brace for impact.
895,"01:03:25,678","01:03:26,846","Guys, look."
896,"01:03:27,263","01:03:28,389",We're almost home!
897,"01:03:28,472","01:03:30,850","- Buddy, I never doubted you.
- Me either."
898,"01:03:32,018","01:03:35,688","Except for the six or seven times
I thought we were going to die."
899,"01:03:50,745","01:03:52,079","What's wrong, sweetheart?"
900,"01:03:52,163","01:03:54,582","You ever say something
you knew you couldn't take back?"
901,"01:03:54,665","01:03:56,042",Is this about Louis?
902,"01:03:56,125","01:03:57,835","I messed up so bad, Mom."
903,"01:03:57,918","01:03:59,712",It's okay. It happens.
904,"01:04:00,004","01:04:03,799","Cute boys can whiplash your brain.
No doubt about that."
905,"01:04:03,883","01:04:05,718",But Ethan was the wrong guy.
906,"01:04:05,801","01:04:06,927",And you figured it out.
907,"01:04:07,428","01:04:09,096",You'll know what to say to Louis.
908,"01:04:15,144","01:04:16,771",What's going on?
909,"01:04:22,443","01:04:23,944",The land bridge.
910,"01:04:24,945","01:04:26,322",It's gone.
911,"01:04:29,658","01:04:31,035",We're trapped!
912,"01:04:33,454","01:04:37,458","But we were supposed to meet Dad here.
What are we going to do?"
913,"01:04:50,012","01:04:51,055",Ellie!
914,"01:04:52,181","01:04:53,307",Peaches!
915,"01:04:57,144","01:04:59,271","Oh, no. The land bridge."
916,"01:04:59,355","01:05:00,815",But if it's gone...
917,"01:05:00,898","01:05:01,941","how are we going to...
- Sid!"
918,"01:05:02,024","01:05:04,068","No, they have to be on the other side."
919,"01:05:04,151","01:05:06,278","Manny, there is no other side."
920,"01:05:06,362","01:05:07,405",They have to be here.
921,"01:05:07,488","01:05:08,531",Ellie!
922,"01:05:09,073","01:05:11,033",Peaches!
923,"01:05:11,200","01:05:13,035",I'm here!
924,"01:05:14,495","01:05:16,122",Please...
925,"01:05:16,205","01:05:17,998",she's got to be here.
926,"01:05:27,383","01:05:28,592",Dad!
927,"01:05:28,676","01:05:30,177","- Wait, did you hear that?
- Manny..."
928,"01:05:30,261","01:05:32,388","No, I heard something. I heard it!"
929,"01:05:35,850","01:05:37,852","- Is that...?
- Peaches? There she is!"
930,"01:05:38,394","01:05:39,437",Dad!
931,"01:05:39,520","01:05:41,856","We're coming, sweetie. Don't move!"
932,"01:05:41,981","01:05:42,982",Daddy!
933,"01:05:43,065","01:05:44,191",Peaches!
934,"01:05:45,359","01:05:47,111","Welcome home, Daddy."
935,"01:05:47,194","01:05:48,279",Let go of me.
936,"01:05:48,988","01:05:50,281",What are the odds?
937,"01:05:50,531","01:05:53,117",We were just talking about you.
938,"01:05:53,325","01:05:58,247","You like the new ship?
I call her Sweet Revenge."
939,"01:05:58,998","01:06:03,586",And look here. We've got the catch du jour.
940,"01:06:04,128","01:06:05,171",Ellie.
941,"01:06:05,337","01:06:07,047",I'm all right.
942,"01:06:07,131","01:06:08,591",Let my daughter go.
943,"01:06:09,383","01:06:10,384",It's okay.
944,"01:06:10,551","01:06:13,345",He wants me. And he's going to get me.
945,"01:06:17,391","01:06:22,354","Sacrificing yourself for your daughter.
How touching."
946,"01:06:22,438","01:06:24,148",How predictable.
947,"01:06:24,231","01:06:25,983",Now come and get her.
948,"01:06:32,907","01:06:33,908","Good day, mate."
949,"01:06:33,991","01:06:35,284",You remember us?
950,"01:06:35,367","01:06:36,744",We're the bad guys.
951,"01:06:36,911","01:06:39,371","All right, let them go."
952,"01:06:40,414","01:06:41,999",I don't think so.
953,"01:06:42,082","01:06:44,710",You destroyed everything I had.
954,"01:06:44,793","01:06:47,213",I'm just returning the favor.
955,"01:06:47,379","01:06:48,756",No!
956,"01:06:50,883","01:06:52,843",I warned you.
957,"01:06:52,927","01:06:54,053",Stop!
958,"01:06:56,764","01:06:59,433",Let the mammoth go!
959,"01:06:59,808","01:07:01,185",Weiner?
960,"01:07:02,770","01:07:04,313",Who brought the muscle to the party?
961,"01:07:04,396","01:07:05,439","Louis, don't!"
962,"01:07:05,773","01:07:08,150","What's he doing?
He's going to get himself killed."
963,"01:07:08,234","01:07:10,152","It's okay, I can handle him."
964,"01:07:10,236","01:07:13,239","How cute, a hero."
965,"01:07:13,322","01:07:15,533",Let's see what bravery gets you.
966,"01:07:15,908","01:07:18,118","Gupta, give the lad your weapon."
967,"01:07:19,286","01:07:20,454","Nice knowing you, kid."
968,"01:07:33,175","01:07:35,052","Let's dance, hero."
969,"01:07:53,279","01:07:56,323",Don't stand there like barnacles. Get him!
970,"01:07:58,492","01:08:00,327","Oi, going somewhere, mate?"
971,"01:08:06,333","01:08:07,668",Let me at him.
972,"01:08:12,423","01:08:14,133",Any last words?
973,"01:08:14,633","01:08:16,552",Precious!
974,"01:08:16,635","01:08:18,762","Will you stop with the ""Precious""?"
975,"01:08:22,182","01:08:23,434",Mummy.
976,"01:08:25,811","01:08:28,439","Well, I guess we showed them, huh?"
977,"01:08:28,522","01:08:30,816","- Precious!
- That's your pet?"
978,"01:08:34,695","01:08:36,989","Maybe that crazy old bat
isn't that crazy after all."
979,"01:08:39,908","01:08:41,201","Nope, she's nuts."
980,"01:08:41,285","01:08:44,788","You waiting for a formal invitation,
fancy pants?"
981,"01:08:44,872","01:08:45,914",Get in.
982,"01:08:45,998","01:08:47,750",I'm going to regret this.
983,"01:08:50,210","01:08:51,545",Bombs away!
984,"01:08:57,926","01:09:00,179",Don't be a scaredy cat.
985,"01:09:07,728","01:09:09,396",This smells worse than me.
986,"01:09:09,480","01:09:12,775","Precious, set your flippers
45 degrees north."
987,"01:09:12,983","01:09:14,652",Granny's done running.
988,"01:09:14,735","01:09:15,736",Back off.
989,"01:09:15,819","01:09:17,655","It's okay, I'm on your side."
990,"01:09:18,614","01:09:20,491",I knew you were a traitor.
991,"01:09:21,158","01:09:24,787","Your little bunny nose wiggles
in the cutest way when you're mad."
992,"01:09:24,870","01:09:26,205",What?
993,"01:09:26,455","01:09:28,332","Your nine lives are over, kitty."
994,"01:09:28,415","01:09:29,500",Silly rabbit...
995,"01:09:29,583","01:09:31,168",piracy doesn't pay.
996,"01:09:31,251","01:09:33,253","Hey, that's not cool. Come on, now."
997,"01:09:40,594","01:09:41,679",Anyone have a body wipe?
998,"01:09:41,762","01:09:44,598","Suck it up, buttercup. How's it looking?"
999,"01:09:47,393","01:09:48,769","Not good, Granny sir."
1000,"01:09:49,687","01:09:50,896",Full speed ahead!
1001,"01:09:51,188","01:09:52,940","Dive, dive, dive!"
1002,"01:10:00,406","01:10:01,740",Fire!
1003,"01:10:04,284","01:10:05,911","Booyah, baby!"
1004,"01:10:09,373","01:10:11,709",This feels so good!
1005,"01:10:11,792","01:10:13,293","Thank you, Mister Whale."
1006,"01:10:13,836","01:10:15,963","- Hi, Manny.
- Sid!"
1007,"01:10:16,046","01:10:17,214",Help!
1008,"01:10:20,259","01:10:21,468",Mom!
1009,"01:10:22,761","01:10:24,972","No, Peaches, I'll get your mother.
You stay there."
1010,"01:10:25,055","01:10:26,432","Hurry, Manny."
1011,"01:10:29,768","01:10:31,562",Payback time.
1012,"01:10:32,604","01:10:33,731",Manny!
1013,"01:10:33,814","01:10:36,066","- Ellie!
- I got this, Dad."
1014,"01:10:36,150","01:10:38,652","Peaches, no! It's too dangerous!"
1015,"01:10:38,736","01:10:40,654",Not if you're half-possum!
1016,"01:10:56,712","01:10:58,088",She did it.
1017,"01:10:58,922","01:11:00,841",My daughter's all grown up.
1018,"01:11:05,512","01:11:07,389",That's my girl.
1019,"01:11:10,601","01:11:12,186",We need to get out of here.
1020,"01:11:12,269","01:11:13,771","Go, go, I'm right behind you."
1021,"01:11:13,854","01:11:14,938",No!
1022,"01:11:15,022","01:11:16,857",I'm right behind you.
1023,"01:11:17,483","01:11:18,650",Dad!
1024,"01:11:27,618","01:11:28,660",No!
1025,"01:11:31,121","01:11:33,457","There's nowhere to run, Manny."
1026,"01:11:45,010","01:11:48,764","You know, this ocean
isn't big enough for the both of us."
1027,"01:11:49,515","01:11:50,599",Don't worry...
1028,"01:11:50,682","01:11:53,936","you won't take up much space
once I flatten you."
1029,"01:12:07,574","01:12:08,784","I told you, tubby..."
1030,"01:12:09,034","01:12:12,079","you shouldn't have messed
with the Master of the Seas."
1031,"01:12:13,455","01:12:16,834","You know, sometimes,
it pays to weigh eleven tons!"
1032,"01:12:17,125","01:12:18,168",No!
1033,"01:12:18,335","01:12:20,796","Bon voyage, monkey boy!"
1034,"01:12:30,264","01:12:32,015",Did somebody hail a whale?
1035,"01:12:35,936","01:12:39,189","So, you must be Precious."
1036,"01:12:40,190","01:12:42,025","Mission accomplished, Granny."
1037,"01:12:42,776","01:12:45,445",Who says old ladies can't drive?
1038,"01:12:55,998","01:13:00,043","Oh, Captain Gutt!"
1039,"01:13:00,669","01:13:02,546",That's me!
1040,"01:13:02,963","01:13:05,465",Let's rule the seas together.
1041,"01:13:05,757","01:13:07,217","Aye, aye."
1042,"01:13:21,315","01:13:22,357",Dad!
1043,"01:13:24,109","01:13:25,986",How's that for an entrance?
1044,"01:13:31,491","01:13:32,951",Dad!
1045,"01:13:33,869","01:13:35,329",Manny.
1046,"01:13:38,165","01:13:40,751","I told you
your father would never give up on us."
1047,"01:13:40,834","01:13:42,669",Never.
1048,"01:13:45,672","01:13:47,674","Hey, I actually..."
1049,"01:13:51,011","01:13:52,304","You know, Sid..."
1050,"01:13:52,387","01:13:53,972",you're not such a screw-up.
1051,"01:13:54,514","01:13:56,141","- Really?
- Really."
1052,"01:13:56,600","01:13:57,893",You're a hero.
1053,"01:13:59,394","01:14:00,687","You too, Granny."
1054,"01:14:00,854","01:14:02,397","Thanks, lady."
1055,"01:14:02,481","01:14:05,150","So, still want me
on your scurvy crew?"
1056,"01:14:05,233","01:14:07,694","You bet.
Welcome to our herd."
1057,"01:14:09,947","01:14:11,365","Hey, you."
1058,"01:14:12,199","01:14:14,868",I can't believe you did that for me.
1059,"01:14:14,952","01:14:16,119",Thank you.
1060,"01:14:16,453","01:14:18,747","Someone once told me,
no matter what..."
1061,"01:14:18,830","01:14:20,582",you never leave a friend behind.
1062,"01:14:22,042","01:14:24,962","All this sweetness
is going to rot my teeth."
1063,"01:14:25,045","01:14:26,088",If I had any.
1064,"01:14:31,510","01:14:33,553",Our home is gone.
1065,"01:14:33,637","01:14:35,305",Where do we go now?
1066,"01:14:51,321","01:14:53,490","Momma loves you, too!"
1067,"01:15:27,733","01:15:30,360","- I can't wait to check this place out.
- Yeah."
1068,"01:15:30,444","01:15:31,862","- Excuse me?
- Dad!"
1069,"01:15:32,112","01:15:35,657","When you two get off this ship,
I expect you both to..."
1070,"01:15:35,741","01:15:36,783",have fun.
1071,"01:15:37,951","01:15:39,161","You're a brave kid, Weiner."
1072,"01:15:39,244","01:15:40,495","Wait, what?"
1073,"01:15:40,620","01:15:43,999","You heard me.
You two should go out and explore."
1074,"01:15:44,499","01:15:45,959",Go where the day takes you.
1075,"01:15:46,960","01:15:48,462",But be back before sunset.
1076,"01:15:49,504","01:15:51,590",An hour after sunset?
1077,"01:15:51,673","01:15:52,883","Yeah, not a minute later."
1078,"01:15:52,966","01:15:54,551",Deal.
1079,"01:15:54,634","01:15:56,678","I love you, Dad."
1080,"01:16:02,184","01:16:03,727",Okay if we hang with you guys?
1081,"01:16:03,810","01:16:04,895",Sure.
1082,"01:16:04,978","01:16:06,563",I always liked him.
1083,"01:16:06,646","01:16:09,983","Louis the hero.
Brave-a-licious."
1084,"01:16:11,693","01:16:13,403",She's not my little girl any more.
1085,"01:16:13,487","01:16:15,489",And you're both going to be just fine.
1086,"01:16:16,198","01:16:17,824",I know.
1087,"01:16:18,033","01:16:22,662","You know, Sidney?
You've got yourself a nice family, here."
1088,"01:16:22,788","01:16:24,956",A real family.
1089,"01:16:25,040","01:16:27,667","Yeah, I'm pretty lucky."
1090,"01:16:27,751","01:16:29,628","Here, chew this kiwi for me."
1091,"01:16:30,128","01:16:31,755",Never again.
1092,"01:16:31,880","01:16:33,548",Ta-da!
1093,"01:16:41,640","01:16:44,017","- Hey, sailor.
- Whoa!"
1094,"01:17:22,848","01:17:24,391","Welcome, brother."
1095,"01:17:27,853","01:17:31,189","Behold, Scratlantis."
