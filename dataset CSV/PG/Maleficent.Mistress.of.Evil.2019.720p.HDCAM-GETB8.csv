3,"00:01:00,508","00:01:03,276","Hey, guys!
Guys, I think we should turn back."
4,"00:01:03,377","00:01:05,843","And lose good money?
Not a chance."
5,"00:01:05,944","00:01:07,411",Stay close.
6,"00:01:15,177","00:01:16,511",Here we are.
7,"00:01:17,944","00:01:19,246",Get on his back.
8,"00:01:38,881","00:01:39,883",Hurry up.
9,"00:01:40,648","00:01:41,849",Whoa!
10,"00:01:45,515","00:01:47,383",Ow!
11,"00:01:48,216","00:01:49,250",Whoa!
12,"00:01:52,149","00:01:53,551","There he is.
Go get him."
13,"00:01:53,651","00:01:55,418","Oh, you'll pay
for that."
14,"00:02:52,394","00:02:54,595","No. No, please."
15,"00:02:54,695","00:02:57,094","Please, no."
16,"00:03:19,298","00:03:20,899",Hold it there.
17,"00:03:38,902","00:03:40,002",I only got one...
18,"00:03:40,101","00:03:41,937",but he's a fine specimen.
19,"00:03:48,937","00:03:50,371","- That's all?
- Yeah."
20,"00:03:50,471","00:03:52,171",That shroom bit me twice.
21,"00:03:52,270","00:03:53,505",Huh.
22,"00:03:59,071","00:04:02,006",Tomb Bloom.
23,"00:04:24,110","00:04:25,877",Once upon a time...
24,"00:04:25,976","00:04:28,076","or perhaps twice upon a time,"
25,"00:04:28,176","00:04:29,877","for you may
remember this story..."
26,"00:04:29,977","00:04:34,512","there was a powerful Fey
named Maleficent."
27,"00:04:43,444","00:04:45,979","For some reason,
the mistress of evil"
28,"00:04:46,079","00:04:47,346",and protector of the Moors...
29,"00:04:47,446","00:04:50,480","was still hated
after all this time."
30,"00:04:50,580","00:04:53,481","True, she had cursed
the princess, Aurora..."
31,"00:04:53,580","00:04:55,514","but that was before
she found light"
32,"00:04:55,614","00:04:57,448","in the heart
of a human child..."
33,"00:04:57,548","00:05:00,382","and raised the girl
as her own."
34,"00:05:00,482","00:05:03,283","After all,
it was Maleficent's love"
35,"00:05:03,382","00:05:06,182","which broke
that very same curse."
36,"00:05:06,283","00:05:10,917","But that detail was somehow
mysteriously forgotten."
37,"00:05:11,017","00:05:12,617",For as the tale was told
38,"00:05:12,718","00:05:16,251","over and again
throughout the kingdom..."
39,"00:05:16,352","00:05:20,486","Maleficent became the villain
once more."
40,"00:05:32,619","00:05:35,120","It's time, guys.
Come on. Let's get everyone."
41,"00:05:35,220","00:05:36,421",It's the big day!
42,"00:05:36,522","00:05:37,422","- Come on.
- Let's go!"
43,"00:05:37,521","00:05:39,323",Wake up. Wake up.
44,"00:05:40,488","00:05:41,857",Come on.
45,"00:05:53,124","00:05:56,292","Hurry up, wallerbogs!
It's time!"
46,"00:06:10,526","00:06:12,360","Do you both remember
the secret plan?"
47,"00:06:12,461","00:06:14,195","I've got it
all right here."
48,"00:06:14,294","00:06:15,596","When do I tell the queen
the secret?"
49,"00:06:15,694","00:06:17,428","You must be patient,
Thistlewit."
50,"00:06:17,529","00:06:19,329","Do you think Queen
Aurora's awake yet?"
51,"00:06:19,429","00:06:22,463","Well, she's not
""Sleeping Beauty"" anymore."
52,"00:06:22,563","00:06:25,097",I see what you did there.
53,"00:06:37,165","00:06:40,899","Next item of business,
the missing fairies."
54,"00:06:40,999","00:06:42,132",I've sent more sprites
55,"00:06:42,232","00:06:44,200","to search
the Tomb Bloom field."
56,"00:06:44,300","00:06:45,601","They'll report back to me
at nightfall."
57,"00:06:45,700","00:06:48,366","We will keep searching
until we find them."
58,"00:06:50,699","00:06:53,167","Please don't raise
your roots at me, Lief."
59,"00:06:53,268","00:06:56,635","Crushing humans with branches
is not going to help."
60,"00:06:58,635","00:07:00,602","Diaval, you're supposed to be
on my side."
61,"00:07:03,035","00:07:06,903","Well, I'm Queen of the Moors,
and I am a human."
62,"00:07:09,369","00:07:13,004","We must all learn
a little kindness."
63,"00:07:13,104","00:07:14,104",Coming through.
64,"00:07:14,204","00:07:15,605",Excuse us.
65,"00:07:15,704","00:07:16,937",Official pixie business.
66,"00:07:17,037","00:07:18,204","A word,
Your Majesty."
67,"00:07:18,305","00:07:19,571","- Maybe two.
- Aunties..."
68,"00:07:19,672","00:07:21,872","you need to wait your turn
like everyone else."
69,"00:07:21,973","00:07:24,072","- No!
- This can't wait, Your Grace."
70,"00:07:24,173","00:07:25,340",Not for a moment.
71,"00:07:25,439","00:07:28,006","Or I might burst.
Truly, I might."
72,"00:07:59,120","00:08:00,120",Is that...?
73,"00:08:03,187","00:08:04,388",Pinto!
74,"00:08:04,487","00:08:05,687","She's come
bearing gifts."
75,"00:08:05,788","00:08:08,789","The first sap
from the warming trees."
76,"00:08:08,889","00:08:11,122",It's for the big day!
77,"00:08:11,221","00:08:12,422","Quiet, Thistlewit."
78,"00:08:12,523","00:08:14,289",What big day?
79,"00:08:16,323","00:08:18,190",Hey! My crown!
80,"00:08:23,490","00:08:25,524",I'm not in the mood for this.
81,"00:08:27,157","00:08:28,625",Pinto!
82,"00:08:28,726","00:08:30,093",Whoa!
83,"00:08:38,494","00:08:39,794",Come on.
84,"00:08:39,894","00:08:42,161","Where are you going,
aunties?"
85,"00:08:44,561","00:08:45,662",Whoa!
86,"00:08:46,661","00:08:47,728","I don't have time
for games, Pinto."
87,"00:09:04,597","00:09:07,531","What's gotten
into all of you?"
88,"00:09:09,265","00:09:11,265",Oh. Uh-oh!
89,"00:09:15,332","00:09:17,066","There she goes,
Your Majesty."
90,"00:09:20,233","00:09:21,833",Come back here.
91,"00:09:27,734","00:09:31,736","Pinto. I've had enough
of your games for today."
92,"00:09:31,836","00:09:33,470",Look at me.
93,"00:09:39,570","00:09:40,637",Oh.
94,"00:09:40,738","00:09:42,604","Philip.
What are you doing here?"
95,"00:09:42,703","00:09:44,337",I was looking for you.
96,"00:09:44,437","00:09:46,137","- Oh, well, hello.
- Hello."
97,"00:09:46,238","00:09:48,505","I'm really sorry,
I can't talk right now."
98,"00:09:48,605","00:09:49,806","The Moors have turned
to madness."
99,"00:09:49,905","00:09:51,439","I've got a castle
full of complaints."
100,"00:09:51,540","00:09:53,472","- I know how busy you are.
- Oh!"
101,"00:09:53,573","00:09:55,073","I wanted to
ask you something."
102,"00:09:55,173","00:09:56,139",Yes.
103,"00:09:56,240","00:09:57,441","Do you think there
could be a union"
104,"00:09:57,541","00:09:59,407","between Ulstead
and the Moors?"
105,"00:10:00,240","00:10:01,840",A union?
106,"00:10:01,941","00:10:03,508",To connect both lands.
107,"00:10:03,608","00:10:06,175","To bring harmony
and peace."
108,"00:10:06,274","00:10:08,341",I've been imagining a bridge.
109,"00:10:08,441","00:10:10,075","Oh, a bridge."
110,"00:10:10,541","00:10:11,642","Yes, a bridge."
111,"00:10:11,742","00:10:14,242","A union's
a wonderful idea..."
112,"00:10:14,343","00:10:17,143",if both sides are willing.
113,"00:10:17,242","00:10:20,277","Well, I'm working
on that part."
114,"00:10:20,378","00:10:21,645",He's going to blow it.
115,"00:10:21,743","00:10:23,111","Give him time.
He's warming up."
116,"00:10:25,811","00:10:27,212",Wait.
117,"00:10:28,544","00:10:30,611",That's your formal coat.
118,"00:10:32,512","00:10:35,112","You're in on all of this,
aren't you?"
119,"00:10:35,212","00:10:36,813","If you're busy,
I could always come back."
120,"00:10:36,913","00:10:38,546","No. No, no."
121,"00:10:38,646","00:10:40,146",I'm not busy at all.
122,"00:10:40,246","00:10:41,447","No, because I'd hate to..."
123,"00:10:41,548","00:10:42,748",Really. All ears.
124,"00:10:42,848","00:10:44,481","What did you
want to talk about?"
125,"00:10:45,647","00:10:47,581","You're right.
He's blowing it."
126,"00:10:48,882","00:10:51,482","Five years ago,
I thought I lost you forever."
127,"00:10:52,848","00:10:56,449","I've decided to reclaim
this day for us."
128,"00:10:56,549","00:10:58,217","I've loved you
since the moment I met you"
129,"00:10:58,317","00:10:59,484",and every day since.
130,"00:11:00,850","00:11:02,818","If love has a truth,
here is mine."
131,"00:11:02,918","00:11:04,418","There is no magic
nor curse"
132,"00:11:04,518","00:11:06,852","that could ever tear me away
from you, Aurora."
133,"00:11:10,784","00:11:12,185","Are you sure
this is a good time?"
134,"00:11:12,286","00:11:13,519","Oh, Philip."
135,"00:11:15,684","00:11:16,820","Oh, he's on his knee."
136,"00:11:16,920","00:11:18,520","He took his sweet
time about it."
137,"00:11:19,620","00:11:21,421",Will you marry me?
138,"00:11:23,320","00:11:24,454",Yes.
139,"00:11:24,555","00:11:26,289","- Yes?
- Yes."
140,"00:11:26,389","00:11:29,622","Yes! Yes, just stand up.
Kiss me."
141,"00:11:39,457","00:11:41,523",We're having a wedding!
142,"00:11:43,423","00:11:46,624",A secret surprise wedding.
143,"00:11:49,491","00:11:51,691","Of course,
we have to tell our parents."
144,"00:11:54,391","00:11:55,726",Do we?
145,"00:12:25,831","00:12:27,299",Mistress.
146,"00:12:27,398","00:12:28,632",What?
147,"00:12:28,732","00:12:30,832","I have
a little bit of news."
148,"00:12:30,933","00:12:33,665","Well, on with it."
149,"00:12:33,766","00:12:35,633","It's nothing
of any real consequence..."
150,"00:12:35,732","00:12:39,833","and it's certainly
no reason to overreact."
151,"00:12:39,934","00:12:41,634",It's just that...
152,"00:12:42,466","00:12:44,567","Prince Philip has, um..."
153,"00:12:44,667","00:12:46,101",Disappeared?
154,"00:12:46,202","00:12:49,268","No.
No. Philip has..."
155,"00:12:49,368","00:12:50,769","Yellow fever?
No, wait!"
156,"00:12:51,901","00:12:53,435",Leprosy!
157,"00:12:53,535","00:12:55,702","No, Mistress."
158,"00:12:55,802","00:12:58,803","Prince Philip has asked Aurora
if she'll become his..."
159,"00:12:58,903","00:13:01,170",Don't...
160,"00:13:01,269","00:13:03,737",ruin my morning.
161,"00:13:07,334","00:13:07,637","Mistress, please."
162,"00:13:11,337","00:13:12,605",Stay calm!
163,"00:13:19,906","00:13:21,340","So, tell me, sire..."
164,"00:13:21,440","00:13:22,807","am I to be a best man,"
165,"00:13:22,907","00:13:24,708","or did you choose a
creature from the Moors?"
166,"00:13:24,807","00:13:26,175","General,
if that's your way"
167,"00:13:26,275","00:13:28,476","of asking me if she said
yes, then I, uh..."
168,"00:13:28,576","00:13:30,508","I know
she said yes, sire."
169,"00:13:30,609","00:13:33,175","What human wouldn't want
to leave that place?"
170,"00:13:33,275","00:13:34,808","What do you have against
Moor folk, Percival?"
171,"00:13:34,908","00:13:37,676","""Moor folk""? Is that what
we're calling them now?"
172,"00:13:37,776","00:13:39,677","Winged beasts,
murderous trees."
173,"00:13:39,777","00:13:41,578","Guard your tongue,
General."
174,"00:13:41,677","00:13:42,610",You know nothing about them.
175,"00:13:42,710","00:13:44,777","I know that Maleficent
is a killer of men..."
176,"00:13:44,877","00:13:48,678","destroyer of armies.
Or so the story goes."
177,"00:13:49,611","00:13:51,379",She's not like that.
178,"00:13:51,478","00:13:53,712","It's my job to protect
this kingdom."
179,"00:13:53,812","00:13:56,246","And I will do so,
old friend..."
180,"00:13:56,346","00:13:58,180",without hesitation.
181,"00:13:58,912","00:14:00,747",Walk on.
182,"00:14:05,247","00:14:07,115",Open the gates!
183,"00:14:16,550","00:14:18,484","Your Majesty,
spoils from the annexation"
184,"00:14:18,583","00:14:20,183",of the Midlands have arrived.
185,"00:14:20,917","00:14:22,118",Weapons.
186,"00:14:23,783","00:14:26,151",No. We have no need of arms.
187,"00:14:26,783","00:14:28,852",Our days of war are over.
188,"00:14:32,218","00:14:34,285",Ingrith...
189,"00:14:34,386","00:14:36,453","you see where
I've had you placed."
190,"00:14:36,553","00:14:37,653",Right behind me.
191,"00:14:38,719","00:14:41,588","And that's
where I'll always be."
192,"00:14:41,688","00:14:45,255","Ingrith, I said
we had no need of arms."
193,"00:14:45,354","00:14:47,655",One can never be too careful.
194,"00:14:53,389","00:14:55,523","Your Majesty, it's cocked."
195,"00:14:55,623","00:14:57,456","Is it, now?"
196,"00:15:02,657","00:15:04,592","- Father, Mother.
- Well?"
197,"00:15:04,690","00:15:06,457",What did she say?
198,"00:15:06,558","00:15:07,591",She said yes.
199,"00:15:07,691","00:15:09,458",Yes!
200,"00:15:09,558","00:15:12,459",That is wonderful news. Oh!
201,"00:15:12,558","00:15:15,259","Two kingdoms united
at last."
202,"00:15:15,359","00:15:16,493",Yes.
203,"00:15:19,859","00:15:21,626",Yes.
204,"00:15:21,727","00:15:23,628","Perhaps I've
been selfish..."
205,"00:15:23,727","00:15:26,661","looking at this
the wrong way."
206,"00:15:26,761","00:15:29,596",You've made your choice.
207,"00:15:29,696","00:15:31,295",Now is a time to celebrate.
208,"00:15:35,827","00:15:37,796","I'm glad
you finally approve."
209,"00:15:37,897","00:15:39,597",Much more than that.
210,"00:15:39,697","00:15:43,865","I am ready to welcome
your fiancee with open arms."
211,"00:15:45,630","00:15:46,730",She shall come to dinner.
212,"00:15:46,831","00:15:48,198",That would be incredible.
213,"00:15:48,297","00:15:49,699",Under one condition.
214,"00:15:49,799","00:15:51,699",She will bring her godmother.
215,"00:15:51,798","00:15:52,831","Your Majesty, I strongly..."
216,"00:15:52,932","00:15:55,333","We will meet the one
who raised her"
217,"00:15:55,433","00:15:56,800",right here in this castle.
218,"00:15:56,900","00:15:58,467","Yes.
The queen is right."
219,"00:15:58,567","00:15:59,734","I'm not sure
her godmother will..."
220,"00:15:59,833","00:16:01,400","No, but I insist."
221,"00:16:01,499","00:16:05,567","After all,
we will soon be family."
222,"00:16:05,667","00:16:07,901","Well, let it be known
throughout the kingdom..."
223,"00:16:08,002","00:16:11,801","that my son
is to marry Aurora."
224,"00:16:13,335","00:16:15,803","And Maleficent
is coming to dinner."
225,"00:16:17,536","00:16:20,202","I shall send word
straightaway."
226,"00:16:34,805","00:16:35,805",Oh!
227,"00:16:42,406","00:16:43,573",Incoming.
228,"00:16:45,974","00:16:49,142",Hold on to your petticoats!
229,"00:17:00,309","00:17:02,210","Well, well."
230,"00:17:04,843","00:17:06,211",So?
231,"00:17:06,843","00:17:08,477",So.
232,"00:17:11,944","00:17:12,944",Godmother...
233,"00:17:16,811","00:17:19,146",Philip asked me to marry him.
234,"00:17:20,379","00:17:21,480",Poor thing.
235,"00:17:21,580","00:17:23,515",He'll recover.
236,"00:17:25,214","00:17:27,548",My answer was yes.
237,"00:17:30,280","00:17:32,414","- No.
- Yes."
238,"00:17:32,515","00:17:33,516",No.
239,"00:17:33,615","00:17:34,882",I wasn't really asking.
240,"00:17:34,983","00:17:36,216",Nor was I.
241,"00:17:36,815","00:17:38,282",What's next?
242,"00:17:38,382","00:17:39,916",You'll turn him into a goat?
243,"00:17:41,250","00:17:42,217",Hmm.
244,"00:17:42,317","00:17:44,383",Stop.
245,"00:17:44,484","00:17:46,485",Why don't you like Philip?
246,"00:17:46,583","00:17:48,485","Well, for one thing,
he's human."
247,"00:17:48,584","00:17:49,851",I'm a human.
248,"00:17:49,952","00:17:53,653","And I have never
held that against you."
249,"00:17:53,751","00:17:55,452",Until I fell in love.
250,"00:17:55,553","00:18:00,687","Love doesn't always
end well, Beasty."
251,"00:18:00,786","00:18:03,419","I'll have you know
Prince Philip is a prince."
252,"00:18:03,520","00:18:06,220","A very handsome
and charming prince."
253,"00:18:09,888","00:18:13,156","I'm just asking you
to trust me."
254,"00:18:13,255","00:18:15,189",Please give him a chance.
255,"00:18:15,289","00:18:16,722",Let us prove you wrong.
256,"00:18:16,823","00:18:18,923",Philip is thoughtful...
257,"00:18:19,023","00:18:20,490",he's very kind...
258,"00:18:20,590","00:18:22,624",Kind of what?
259,"00:18:22,724","00:18:24,758","The king and queen
are celebrating tonight..."
260,"00:18:24,858","00:18:27,892","and they have invited
both of us to the castle."
261,"00:18:27,991","00:18:33,359","You want me
to meet his parents?"
262,"00:18:33,458","00:18:34,658",It's just a dinner.
263,"00:18:35,692","00:18:38,460","They don't want me
in Ulstead."
264,"00:18:38,559","00:18:40,626",Why on earth would I go?
265,"00:18:40,727","00:18:43,694","Because his mother
wishes to meet mine."
266,"00:18:45,260","00:18:46,694",Please.
267,"00:18:54,528","00:18:56,696",Philip.
268,"00:18:56,795","00:18:58,595","I want you
to wear this tonight."
269,"00:18:59,963","00:19:01,230",Your sword?
270,"00:19:01,329","00:19:02,630","Because of you,"
271,"00:19:02,731","00:19:04,898","Ulstead and the Moors
will be united at last."
272,"00:19:08,497","00:19:09,764","Father,
my love for Aurora"
273,"00:19:09,865","00:19:11,599","has nothing to do
with politics."
274,"00:19:11,697","00:19:13,866","Yes, but your love..."
275,"00:19:13,965","00:19:17,798","will ensure peace
for generations."
276,"00:19:17,899","00:19:20,332","Now take it.
And wear it..."
277,"00:19:20,433","00:19:23,700","to know that you will
never have to use it."
278,"00:19:25,267","00:19:27,234","Oh, my son."
279,"00:19:28,369","00:19:30,669",I've never been more proud.
280,"00:19:32,735","00:19:34,536",And what about Mother?
281,"00:19:34,636","00:19:37,537",Is she okay with this?
282,"00:19:37,636","00:19:41,836","Your mother will learn
to love who you love."
283,"00:20:35,979","00:20:37,712",Oh.
284,"00:20:37,813","00:20:41,246","Tomb Bloom.
Tomb Bloom."
285,"00:20:53,448","00:20:54,749",Oh.
286,"00:20:57,650","00:21:00,184",I'm losing my patience.
287,"00:21:00,284","00:21:01,484",Your Majesty.
288,"00:21:01,584","00:21:04,318","You need to move faster,
Lickspittle."
289,"00:21:04,417","00:21:05,485","Yes, Your Majesty."
290,"00:21:07,652","00:21:09,585",Aurora said yes.
291,"00:21:13,685","00:21:16,686",It's all coming together...
292,"00:21:18,386","00:21:20,319",perfectly.
293,"00:21:29,553","00:21:31,222",Hello.
294,"00:21:32,288","00:21:33,822",Hello.
295,"00:21:35,822","00:21:37,557",Hello.
296,"00:21:38,956","00:21:41,491","Try it with
a little less fang."
297,"00:21:43,955","00:21:45,557",How's this?
298,"00:21:47,724","00:21:50,258",Try the greeting.
299,"00:21:50,358","00:21:53,592","How kind of you
to invite me this evening."
300,"00:21:53,692","00:21:56,326","Remember,
it's not a threat."
301,"00:21:56,425","00:22:01,393","So very kind of you
to invite me this evening."
302,"00:22:01,494","00:22:04,493","- Yeah. Better.
- Oh."
303,"00:22:04,594","00:22:05,727",Try it with a curtsy.
304,"00:22:07,661","00:22:09,661",We can skip that part.
305,"00:22:13,994","00:22:16,529","She really loves that boy,
you know."
306,"00:22:17,828","00:22:19,962","You're doing her
a great kindness."
307,"00:22:21,962","00:22:23,729",Kindness?
308,"00:22:24,663","00:22:25,830",Mistress...
309,"00:22:39,598","00:22:41,599",Doesn't she look lovely?
310,"00:22:45,766","00:22:47,533",I have something for you.
311,"00:22:47,633","00:22:48,767",Hmm?
312,"00:22:50,768","00:22:52,969",For your horns.
313,"00:22:53,068","00:22:54,603","I just thought
it might make"
314,"00:22:54,701","00:22:56,702","Philip's family
feel more comfortable."
315,"00:22:57,334","00:22:58,503","And you, as well."
316,"00:23:02,535","00:23:04,204",Maybe it's a bad idea.
317,"00:23:04,304","00:23:05,771","No, it's..."
318,"00:23:07,536","00:23:08,772",It's all right.
319,"00:23:17,872","00:23:19,739",I'm so excited.
320,"00:23:19,839","00:23:23,241","Mmm... It's more
than I can bear."
321,"00:23:59,479","00:24:01,681",It's Maleficent!
322,"00:24:07,514","00:24:08,948",Pitchforks?
323,"00:24:09,048","00:24:11,748","- Humans are hilarious.
- Mmm-hmm."
324,"00:24:15,882","00:24:17,683","- It's getting better.
- Hmm."
325,"00:24:32,917","00:24:35,418","Anyone leaves
their post gets hung."
326,"00:24:35,519","00:24:36,652","Yes, sir."
327,"00:24:46,486","00:24:48,287",They're here.
328,"00:24:54,987","00:24:57,522","Have you ever considered
turning me into a bear?"
329,"00:24:57,623","00:24:59,756","I think I'd make
quite an impressive one."
330,"00:24:59,856","00:25:01,390","Look at their claws.
They're so strong."
331,"00:25:01,490","00:25:03,324","Why are we
talking about bears?"
332,"00:25:04,657","00:25:06,857","Presenting Queen Aurora
of the Moors."
333,"00:25:16,391","00:25:18,293",Thank you.
334,"00:25:19,626","00:25:21,360",You look wonderful.
335,"00:25:21,460","00:25:22,961","I'm so happy
to be here."
336,"00:25:24,692","00:25:27,627","Aurora, this is
truly an honor."
337,"00:25:31,328","00:25:33,562",Welcome to Ulstead.
338,"00:25:35,728","00:25:37,762",Such a beautiful girl.
339,"00:25:37,862","00:25:40,630","I can see how you stole
Philip's heart."
340,"00:25:41,995","00:25:43,929",Your Majesty.
341,"00:25:46,329","00:25:48,564","The flowers
in your hair."
342,"00:25:48,663","00:25:50,397",I'm allergic.
343,"00:25:50,497","00:25:51,664",I'm so sorry.
344,"00:25:51,765","00:25:53,965","Oh, no. No, no.
It's all right."
345,"00:25:54,065","00:25:55,332",They're beautiful.
346,"00:25:55,433","00:25:56,665",Presenting Maleficent.
347,"00:26:07,901","00:26:10,702","Maleficent, it's wonderful
to see you again."
348,"00:26:12,668","00:26:15,402","This is my father,
King John of Ulstead."
349,"00:26:15,502","00:26:17,970","And my mother,
Queen Ingrith."
350,"00:26:18,070","00:26:20,869",Welcome to our home.
351,"00:26:24,003","00:26:28,705","It's so very kind of you
to invite me this evening."
352,"00:26:28,804","00:26:29,838",Don't smile.
353,"00:26:32,305","00:26:36,372","And, um, I would like
to introduce you to Diaval."
354,"00:26:36,471","00:26:40,339","I trust you had no trouble
finding the castle."
355,"00:26:40,439","00:26:42,306",Why would I have trouble?
356,"00:26:43,972","00:26:45,574",Shoo!
357,"00:26:45,673","00:26:48,307",He's making small talk.
358,"00:26:48,408","00:26:50,709",I'll explain it later.
359,"00:26:50,809","00:26:52,275",No trouble at all.
360,"00:26:52,375","00:26:54,475","Your Majesties,
ladies and gentlemen,"
361,"00:26:54,575","00:26:55,874",dinner is served.
362,"00:26:55,974","00:26:59,009","Please, make yourselves
at home."
363,"00:27:16,878","00:27:17,878",Hmm.
364,"00:27:28,446","00:27:29,780",Bird.
365,"00:27:31,615","00:27:33,382",Delicious.
366,"00:27:41,715","00:27:43,583",Is there a problem?
367,"00:27:45,549","00:27:46,817",It's iron.
368,"00:27:46,918","00:27:49,484","Majesty, as you are
sensitive to flowers,"
369,"00:27:49,584","00:27:50,950",she is averse to iron.
370,"00:27:52,750","00:27:54,418",I had no idea.
371,"00:27:54,518","00:27:56,951",Take it away at once.
372,"00:28:02,720","00:28:05,320","I trust you'll be comfortable
using your hands?"
373,"00:28:06,886","00:28:09,587","Such a warm
spell of weather, isn't it?"
374,"00:28:09,688","00:28:11,288",It certainly is.
375,"00:28:13,620","00:28:14,988",Shoo!
376,"00:28:15,088","00:28:18,421","Well, we have a small gift
for Philip and Aurora..."
377,"00:28:18,521","00:28:23,023","to celebrate their
glorious future together. Hmm?"
378,"00:28:31,957","00:28:33,726","Oh, I simply can't wait"
379,"00:28:33,825","00:28:35,591","to have a little one running
through the castle again."
380,"00:28:40,425","00:28:41,659",This castle?
381,"00:28:41,759","00:28:43,326","Yes, of course."
382,"00:28:45,793","00:28:47,793",This will be their home.
383,"00:28:47,894","00:28:51,762","I hear Aurora has
a castle of her own."
384,"00:28:52,627","00:28:54,527","Yes, sir, I do."
385,"00:28:54,628","00:28:56,862",Yes...
386,"00:28:56,962","00:29:01,730","I'm curious. How did Aurora
become Queen of the Moors?"
387,"00:29:01,829","00:29:03,663","- I made her queen.
- Her castle is"
388,"00:29:03,764","00:29:04,964","quite stunning.
You must see it."
389,"00:29:05,064","00:29:08,365","Yes, but in fact,
she has another castle."
390,"00:29:09,630","00:29:10,897",Does she not?
391,"00:29:12,364","00:29:13,366",Mother...
392,"00:29:13,465","00:29:14,566","One in the Moors,"
393,"00:29:14,665","00:29:17,431","and one left behind
by her father."
394,"00:29:17,532","00:29:20,898","King Stefan,
was it not?"
395,"00:29:20,999","00:29:25,268","That castle was never my home.
It was given to the people."
396,"00:29:25,367","00:29:28,000","So, you're also
a true princess."
397,"00:29:28,101","00:29:30,333","Even though Stefan died.
Was killed?"
398,"00:29:30,434","00:29:32,602","Remind me, did he die
or was he killed?"
399,"00:29:33,435","00:29:35,669",Both.
400,"00:29:37,001","00:29:39,335","Yes, you're right,
it is very warm recently."
401,"00:29:39,436","00:29:43,504","Because I remember
the story of a baby."
402,"00:29:43,602","00:29:46,771",A baby cursed to sleep...
403,"00:29:47,569","00:29:48,903",and never wake up.
404,"00:29:49,769","00:29:51,537",Really?
405,"00:29:51,638","00:29:53,006","Who would do
such a terrible thing"
406,"00:29:53,104","00:29:55,338",to an innocent child?
407,"00:29:56,971","00:30:01,573","Well, there are many who prey
on the innocent."
408,"00:30:01,672","00:30:03,972","I'm sure
your kind would agree."
409,"00:30:04,073","00:30:05,974","What do you mean,
my kind?"
410,"00:30:06,073","00:30:08,041",She means humans.
411,"00:30:08,140","00:30:10,274","There are fairies missing
from the Moors."
412,"00:30:10,375","00:30:11,875","What I'm missing
is some wine."
413,"00:30:11,974","00:30:13,807",Stolen by human poachers.
414,"00:30:13,908","00:30:15,476","That's the first
I've heard of it."
415,"00:30:15,575","00:30:16,875",Someone gave the order.
416,"00:30:24,543","00:30:26,910","It sounds as if
you're accusing the king."
417,"00:30:27,909","00:30:29,311","No, she never said that."
418,"00:30:29,410","00:30:31,844","Wait... Sorry,
who would steal a fairy?"
419,"00:30:31,944","00:30:33,311","Your Majesty,
I must report"
420,"00:30:33,412","00:30:34,578","that two peasants
were found dead..."
421,"00:30:34,679","00:30:36,545",just outside the Moors.
422,"00:30:36,644","00:30:38,445","They'd been missing
for several days."
423,"00:30:38,545","00:30:39,846",I see.
424,"00:30:39,946","00:30:42,413","Yes, we all see."
425,"00:30:42,512","00:30:43,780","The borders are open,"
426,"00:30:43,879","00:30:45,580","but humans are not welcome.
Isn't that right?"
427,"00:30:47,048","00:30:49,315","What exactly are you implying,
Your Majesty?"
428,"00:30:49,414","00:30:52,881","Innocent men are being
slaughtered on the Moors..."
429,"00:30:52,982","00:30:54,949","and she's talking
about fairies."
430,"00:30:59,348","00:31:01,349",Contain your animal.
431,"00:31:01,448","00:31:03,284",Or I will.
432,"00:31:07,850","00:31:08,951","If I didn't know better,"
433,"00:31:09,050","00:31:10,484","I'd say you were
making a threat."
434,"00:31:10,585","00:31:11,652","Well, do you?"
435,"00:31:11,751","00:31:13,852","- Do I what?
- Know better?"
436,"00:31:13,951","00:31:14,817",Enough.
437,"00:31:14,918","00:31:16,386",Put her down.
438,"00:31:17,685","00:31:19,818","Please, put her down."
439,"00:31:21,852","00:31:24,920",We're here to celebrate.
440,"00:31:27,754","00:31:29,855","Forgive me, he's right."
441,"00:31:29,954","00:31:31,954","Let's not forget
why we're here."
442,"00:31:32,055","00:31:35,322","The start of a new life
for Aurora."
443,"00:31:36,955","00:31:38,789","- Cheers.
- Cheers."
444,"00:31:42,556","00:31:46,357","You have done an admirable
job, Maleficent..."
445,"00:31:46,457","00:31:50,791","going against your own nature
to raise this child."
446,"00:31:51,424","00:31:53,325",But now...
447,"00:31:53,424","00:31:56,691",Aurora will finally get...
448,"00:31:56,791","00:31:59,325",the love of a real family.
449,"00:32:00,058","00:32:01,492",A real mother.
450,"00:32:01,592","00:32:04,793","Because the one thing
I regret..."
451,"00:32:04,894","00:32:07,694","is never having a daughter
of my own."
452,"00:32:07,794","00:32:10,695",But tonight changes that.
453,"00:32:10,795","00:32:16,428","Tonight,
I consider Aurora my own."
454,"00:32:30,630","00:32:31,698",Guards!
455,"00:32:31,797","00:32:33,766","We have opened our home
to a witch!"
456,"00:32:44,533","00:32:45,701",Stop!
457,"00:32:46,600","00:32:48,034",There is no union.
458,"00:32:48,135","00:32:49,467",There will be no wedding.
459,"00:32:49,567","00:32:52,535","- Maleficent!
- We must protect the king!"
460,"00:32:52,635","00:32:54,402","Maleficent, please, stop now."
461,"00:32:54,501","00:32:57,303","John, I'm so frightened."
462,"00:32:57,402","00:32:58,335",Ah!
463,"00:32:58,436","00:33:00,436",What has she done to me?
464,"00:33:01,770","00:33:03,337",Father!
465,"00:33:04,804","00:33:05,937",John!
466,"00:33:06,536","00:33:07,871",We go home.
467,"00:33:09,603","00:33:10,772",John!
468,"00:33:11,737","00:33:12,904",It's a curse.
469,"00:33:15,472","00:33:16,873",It's a curse!
470,"00:33:16,971","00:33:19,073","Maleficent has cursed
the king!"
471,"00:33:21,772","00:33:23,005",What have you done?
472,"00:33:23,106","00:33:25,607",I've done nothing.
473,"00:33:25,706","00:33:28,340","Aurora, we go home now."
474,"00:33:30,407","00:33:31,408",Aurora!
475,"00:33:45,075","00:33:46,476",Aurora!
476,"00:33:46,577","00:33:47,944",Wake him!
477,"00:33:50,110","00:33:51,977","Wake him, please."
478,"00:35:15,392","00:35:16,793",Stand aside!
479,"00:35:18,824","00:35:20,327",To the bedroom!
480,"00:35:21,924","00:35:24,727","This magic, we have
no tools to reverse it."
481,"00:35:27,160","00:35:29,427",There must be a lesion.
482,"00:35:29,527","00:35:30,894",Proof of her witchery.
483,"00:35:30,995","00:35:33,362","Please,
leave His Majesty his dignity."
484,"00:35:33,461","00:35:36,661","We all saw what Maleficent
did to him."
485,"00:35:36,762","00:35:38,396",I'm so sorry.
486,"00:35:38,494","00:35:42,062","A curse upon our king
is a curse upon this kingdom."
487,"00:35:43,595","00:35:46,563",All he wanted was peace.
488,"00:35:46,663","00:35:48,698",This is all my fault.
489,"00:35:48,797","00:35:51,997","You have nothing
to apologize for, my dear."
490,"00:35:52,097","00:35:55,998","Maleficent is a threat
to everyone."
491,"00:35:56,099","00:35:58,899",Especially you.
492,"00:35:58,998","00:36:02,465","We'll do our best
to protect you."
493,"00:36:02,566","00:36:04,767","There must be a way
to reverse this."
494,"00:36:06,099","00:36:08,867","Mother, could you
try kissing him?"
495,"00:36:10,734","00:36:12,935",True love and all that.
496,"00:36:17,002","00:36:18,836","I doubt
that would work."
497,"00:36:18,935","00:36:20,070",It could save him.
498,"00:36:20,170","00:36:23,337","- A kiss is just a kiss.
- Please, Mother."
499,"00:36:23,437","00:36:24,970",Very well.
500,"00:36:35,570","00:36:37,805",You wanted peace...
501,"00:36:37,905","00:36:41,038",now rest in peace forever.
502,"00:36:49,839","00:36:51,807",I told you.
503,"00:36:51,907","00:36:55,508",This is no fairy tale.
504,"00:36:55,607","00:36:57,709","I have to return
to the Moors."
505,"00:36:57,808","00:36:58,842",It's the only way.
506,"00:36:58,941","00:37:00,408","Wait, wait. Come here."
507,"00:37:00,509","00:37:01,810",I have to find her.
508,"00:37:01,910","00:37:03,010","It's the middle
of the night."
509,"00:37:03,110","00:37:04,810","She will break the curse.
I know she will."
510,"00:37:04,909","00:37:06,910","Okay, well,
let me come with you."
511,"00:37:07,011","00:37:09,445","No. You should stay
with your family."
512,"00:37:09,543","00:37:10,876",You are my family.
513,"00:37:12,744","00:37:14,778","Let her go, Philip."
514,"00:37:14,878","00:37:17,379",Maybe she can save him.
515,"00:38:13,086","00:38:14,721",Maleficent!
516,"00:38:18,455","00:38:20,090",Maleficent!
517,"00:38:27,556","00:38:29,390",Godmother!
518,"00:38:36,123","00:38:38,692",Please come back.
519,"00:38:42,692","00:38:43,860",She's not in the Moors.
520,"00:38:45,125","00:38:46,126",Diaval.
521,"00:38:47,726","00:38:49,527",No one's seen her.
522,"00:38:49,626","00:38:51,127",I'm so happy to see you.
523,"00:38:52,859","00:38:54,461",She's nowhere to be found.
524,"00:38:55,728","00:38:57,628","What if she
never comes back?"
525,"00:38:57,728","00:38:59,830","I could be stuck
as a human forever."
526,"00:38:59,929","00:39:01,796",I have to find her.
527,"00:39:04,529","00:39:07,697","She's the only one
who can break the curse."
528,"00:40:07,572","00:40:08,973",Tell me she's dead.
529,"00:40:09,840","00:40:12,074",The iron pierced her flesh.
530,"00:40:12,173","00:40:15,007","She fell into the river
and went over the falls."
531,"00:40:16,542","00:40:19,642",Then where is her head?
532,"00:40:19,742","00:40:21,808",There was something else.
533,"00:40:21,908","00:40:24,042",Another creature.
534,"00:40:24,142","00:40:27,642","It pulled her from
the depths of the sea."
535,"00:40:27,742","00:40:29,444",What did it look like?
536,"00:40:29,975","00:40:30,976",Her.
537,"00:40:32,676","00:40:34,711","It carried her
up into the sky."
538,"00:40:34,810","00:40:37,444","Hmm. A wounded animal
lashes out"
539,"00:40:37,544","00:40:38,679",and now she's not alone.
540,"00:40:38,778","00:40:42,045",We must be ready for war.
541,"00:40:44,246","00:40:46,381","Maleficent has
cursed the king!"
542,"00:40:52,913","00:40:54,013",Stay inside!
543,"00:41:01,047","00:41:02,916","Maleficent has
cursed the king!"
544,"00:42:35,598","00:42:39,799","If Conall hadn't
found her, she would be dead."
545,"00:42:43,232","00:42:45,433","They tried to kill her
with this."
546,"00:43:01,902","00:43:04,036",Do you hear it?
547,"00:43:05,470","00:43:06,470",Do you hear it?
548,"00:43:08,135","00:43:09,970",Huh?
549,"00:43:10,071","00:43:11,936","It's a message
from the humans."
550,"00:43:13,470","00:43:15,671",I hear it loud and clear.
551,"00:43:15,770","00:43:18,938",Time for us to die.
552,"00:43:19,037","00:43:22,839","Humans have used iron
against us for centuries."
553,"00:43:22,938","00:43:25,540","And we are almost extinct
because of it."
554,"00:43:25,639","00:43:26,939","Killing peasants
on the Moors"
555,"00:43:27,040","00:43:29,774","will only lead
to more conflict, Borra."
556,"00:43:29,874","00:43:31,441","They've pulled the iron
from the earth..."
557,"00:43:31,540","00:43:34,440","made their swords and shields,
drove us underground."
558,"00:43:34,541","00:43:35,907",But this...
559,"00:43:38,907","00:43:40,175",This will finish us.
560,"00:43:40,276","00:43:42,410","Our people are safe
here for now."
561,"00:43:42,509","00:43:43,776",But for how long?
562,"00:43:43,876","00:43:45,909","The humans will find us.
They will not stop."
563,"00:43:46,608","00:43:48,611",I call for war.
564,"00:43:50,209","00:43:51,777",I call for war!
565,"00:43:51,878","00:43:53,178",Right now!
566,"00:43:54,577","00:43:56,445","There are
too many humans."
567,"00:43:58,845","00:43:59,878",Too many kingdoms.
568,"00:43:59,978","00:44:02,145","Conall,
they will keep finding"
569,"00:44:02,246","00:44:04,113",new ways to destroy us.
570,"00:44:04,212","00:44:05,913",We can't win.
571,"00:44:09,847","00:44:12,113",We can't win!
572,"00:44:14,781","00:44:15,915",Not this way.
573,"00:44:17,214","00:44:19,481","No. You're wrong, Conall."
574,"00:44:21,048","00:44:23,815","We have something
they didn't plan on."
575,"00:44:26,048","00:44:27,949",We have her.
576,"00:44:32,916","00:44:34,951","She holds powers
none of us possess."
577,"00:44:36,983","00:44:38,751","She is wounded, Borra."
578,"00:44:39,885","00:44:41,453",Who are you?
579,"00:44:53,053","00:44:54,654",Hmm.
580,"00:44:56,288","00:44:57,789",Hmm.
581,"00:44:57,888","00:45:00,122",You reek of human.
582,"00:45:01,889","00:45:03,890",Maybe I was wrong about you.
583,"00:45:03,990","00:45:05,990","Or maybe Conall should have
left you for dead"
584,"00:45:06,090","00:45:07,791",at the bottom of the sea.
585,"00:45:11,623","00:45:12,890",No.
586,"00:45:14,224","00:45:16,457","It's there, isn't it?"
587,"00:45:17,824","00:45:19,158",It's inside you.
588,"00:45:20,190","00:45:21,425",Mmm.
589,"00:45:22,791","00:45:24,692",Ahhh!
590,"00:45:38,193","00:45:39,461",You see?
591,"00:45:43,595","00:45:45,695",You see what's inside her?
592,"00:45:47,596","00:45:49,130",That is what will save us all.
593,"00:46:07,232","00:46:08,934",You saved me.
594,"00:46:12,567","00:46:13,900",Come.
595,"00:46:18,568","00:46:20,935",Let me show you who we are.
596,"00:47:16,676","00:47:17,944",We're Dark Fey.
597,"00:47:19,611","00:47:21,012",Same as you.
598,"00:47:32,714","00:47:34,015",We're all that remain.
599,"00:47:35,713","00:47:38,214","Unseen here,
far away from mankind."
600,"00:47:38,780","00:47:39,781",Look!
601,"00:47:41,182","00:47:42,714","As more
human kingdoms emerged,"
602,"00:47:42,814","00:47:44,148",we went into hiding...
603,"00:47:44,249","00:47:46,783","from every corner
of the earth..."
604,"00:47:46,883","00:47:49,916","doing what we had to,
to survive."
605,"00:47:50,016","00:47:52,917",But many were lost.
606,"00:48:15,153","00:48:17,788","Only a few
generations ago..."
607,"00:48:17,888","00:48:20,188","our kind roamed
every part of the world."
608,"00:48:21,655","00:48:22,856",The tundra.
609,"00:48:22,956","00:48:24,490",The forest.
610,"00:48:24,588","00:48:25,921",The jungle.
611,"00:48:29,789","00:48:31,924",The desert.
612,"00:48:36,056","00:48:40,125","Now, our only refuge
is here..."
613,"00:48:40,224","00:48:41,792",in this cave.
614,"00:48:41,891","00:48:43,859",Our nest of origin.
615,"00:48:48,158","00:48:51,027","Listen.
Play in the wind."
616,"00:48:52,727","00:48:53,894",Go!
617,"00:49:13,796","00:49:14,931","Those children
should be soaring"
618,"00:49:15,030","00:49:17,064",over the trees and rivers.
619,"00:49:17,165","00:49:19,765","Instead,
they are raised in exile."
620,"00:49:19,865","00:49:21,499",I could protect them.
621,"00:49:23,031","00:49:25,798","How? By waging war
against the humans?"
622,"00:49:25,898","00:49:27,866","I've been at war with them
my whole life."
623,"00:49:27,966","00:49:29,866",Not all of them.
624,"00:49:29,967","00:49:32,501","There was one you raised
as your own."
625,"00:49:34,567","00:49:37,768","Maybe we don't have to hide
from the humans."
626,"00:49:37,868","00:49:39,836","Maybe we can exist
without fear..."
627,"00:49:39,936","00:49:42,002",and war.
628,"00:49:42,102","00:49:44,837",Find a way together.
629,"00:49:46,269","00:49:48,103",That will never happen.
630,"00:50:16,074","00:50:17,842",Oh.
631,"00:50:34,310","00:50:35,978",Whoa.
632,"00:50:42,711","00:50:44,011",Whoa!
633,"00:51:07,283","00:51:09,250",Ow! Oh.
634,"00:51:09,917","00:51:11,084",Huh?
635,"00:51:19,984","00:51:21,686",Gotcha!
636,"00:51:26,320","00:51:29,253",Welcome to your new home.
637,"00:51:48,088","00:51:50,889","We've been worried
about you, dear."
638,"00:51:51,757","00:51:52,924",Your Majesty.
639,"00:51:53,722","00:51:55,690",I couldn't find her.
640,"00:51:55,791","00:51:59,124",My heart breaks for you.
641,"00:51:59,223","00:52:01,691","She has brought
a cloud of darkness"
642,"00:52:01,791","00:52:03,825",upon your happiness.
643,"00:52:03,926","00:52:06,659","I know she was
against this marriage."
644,"00:52:06,759","00:52:10,092","Never trusted your
instincts as a queen."
645,"00:52:10,192","00:52:13,026",When I saw her at dinner...
646,"00:52:14,093","00:52:17,095",with her horns covered...
647,"00:52:19,562","00:52:21,161",bent cowering...
648,"00:52:25,862","00:52:30,197","Well, it's no wonder
that she lashed out."
649,"00:52:30,296","00:52:32,630","I just don't know
what to do."
650,"00:52:32,730","00:52:35,563","You do truly love him,
don't you?"
651,"00:52:35,664","00:52:37,498",My son.
652,"00:52:37,597","00:52:38,564",Deeply.
653,"00:52:39,764","00:52:42,966","It is love
that will heal you."
654,"00:52:43,065","00:52:45,232",It's what heals us all.
655,"00:52:45,333","00:52:48,967","Let's move
forward together..."
656,"00:52:49,699","00:52:51,533",as a family.
657,"00:53:07,834","00:53:10,704","To all who live
on the Moors..."
658,"00:53:12,604","00:53:14,804",What is that noise?
659,"00:53:14,904","00:53:16,271","...and kingdoms
far and wide,"
660,"00:53:16,371","00:53:17,904","the king and queen
invite you..."
661,"00:53:18,004","00:53:20,271",to attend the wedding...
662,"00:53:20,371","00:53:23,838","of their son Philip to Aurora
in three days' time."
663,"00:53:24,572","00:53:26,106",All are welcome.
664,"00:53:26,205","00:53:27,172",Huh?
665,"00:53:28,973","00:53:32,874",And all are expected!
666,"00:53:32,973","00:53:35,640","Did you hear that?
We're invited to the castle!"
667,"00:53:35,741","00:53:37,773","I knew Aurora
wouldn't abandon us!"
668,"00:53:37,873","00:53:39,940","I always knew
I'd be invited."
669,"00:53:40,041","00:53:42,909","Just glad you two
made the cut."
670,"00:53:43,008","00:53:45,008",Who's getting married?
671,"00:53:52,977","00:53:57,011","Aurora, we don't have to think
about the wedding right now."
672,"00:53:58,109","00:54:00,045",The queen is right.
673,"00:54:00,145","00:54:02,879",We owe it to everyone...
674,"00:54:02,979","00:54:05,245",especially the king.
675,"00:54:05,978","00:54:08,112",What about Maleficent?
676,"00:54:11,211","00:54:13,280",She's gone.
677,"00:54:25,981","00:54:27,517",The Phoenix.
678,"00:54:27,616","00:54:30,083","It is said the Dark Fey
began with her..."
679,"00:54:31,316","00:54:33,550",evolved over centuries.
680,"00:54:35,050","00:54:38,051","You are the last
of her descendants."
681,"00:54:38,151","00:54:40,852",Her blood is your own.
682,"00:54:42,284","00:54:44,118",You are her.
683,"00:54:47,152","00:54:50,819","In your hands,
you hold the power of life and death..."
684,"00:54:50,919","00:54:53,920",destruction and rebirth.
685,"00:54:54,986","00:54:57,220",But nature's greatest power
686,"00:54:57,321","00:55:00,921","is the power
of true transformation."
687,"00:55:02,254","00:55:05,956","You transformed
when you raised Aurora."
688,"00:55:07,689","00:55:09,890",When you found love...
689,"00:55:09,990","00:55:13,156",in the middle of your pain.
690,"00:55:14,823","00:55:18,025","I'm asking you
to take all of your fury..."
691,"00:55:18,125","00:55:20,525",all of your pain...
692,"00:55:20,625","00:55:22,925",and not use it.
693,"00:55:23,024","00:55:26,526","Help us broker peace
with the humans."
694,"00:55:28,025","00:55:29,926",Because peace...
695,"00:55:30,026","00:55:34,861","could be the Dark Fey's
final transformation."
696,"00:56:12,024","00:56:16,058","The Moors are our last
true nature on earth."
697,"00:56:16,158","00:56:20,126","And yet you named
a human as queen."
698,"00:56:20,226","00:56:23,126",A daughter you cared for.
699,"00:56:25,026","00:56:27,294",I have no daughter.
700,"00:56:29,893","00:56:32,295",She has chosen her side.
701,"00:56:44,730","00:56:46,631",We've just heard.
702,"00:56:46,731","00:56:49,831","There's going to be a wedding
at the castle in three days."
703,"00:56:51,064","00:56:53,832","Humans will come
from all over."
704,"00:56:53,931","00:56:55,665",That's when we attack.
705,"00:56:55,766","00:56:58,767","We'll kill the king
and queen of Ulstead..."
706,"00:56:58,866","00:57:01,000",and their young prince.
707,"00:57:03,666","00:57:06,067",Their kingdom will fall.
708,"00:57:06,168","00:57:09,034",And the Fey will rise again.
709,"00:57:24,770","00:57:27,304",The fairies made it.
710,"00:57:42,007","00:57:46,041","I wore it when I
married the king."
711,"00:57:52,641","00:57:55,608",I'm sure it's perfect.
712,"00:57:56,108","00:57:57,576",So am I.
713,"00:58:03,243","00:58:06,011","Your Majesty,
she's absolutely lovely."
714,"00:58:06,111","00:58:07,844","Considering
how she was raised."
715,"00:58:07,944","00:58:10,844","By the same evil witch
who cursed her."
716,"00:58:10,945","00:58:13,745","It's a miracle Prince
Philip came along."
717,"00:58:13,844","00:58:14,945",It's a miracle
718,"00:58:15,046","00:58:16,946","the poor child is
alive at all."
719,"00:58:17,979","00:58:19,980",Thank you so much.
720,"00:58:20,080","00:58:21,180",It's exquisite.
721,"00:58:51,716","00:58:53,152",When I'm older...
722,"00:58:53,252","00:58:56,085","I'm going to live here,
in the Moors, with you."
723,"00:58:56,186","00:58:58,919","Then we can
look after each other."
724,"00:59:19,822","00:59:22,056","- Tell me what's troubling you.
- It's nothing."
725,"00:59:23,056","00:59:25,924","Aurora, I know you
better than that."
726,"00:59:28,657","00:59:29,925",This jewelry...
727,"00:59:30,724","00:59:31,991",my hair...
728,"00:59:32,091","00:59:34,091",all these rules.
729,"00:59:34,192","00:59:37,859",I can't breathe.
730,"00:59:37,959","00:59:40,859","I feel like I'm not
Queen of the Moors anymore."
731,"00:59:40,958","00:59:43,226","I feel like
a different person."
732,"00:59:43,326","00:59:44,794",Listen...
733,"00:59:45,959","00:59:48,695","I fell in love with a girl
in the forest and only her."
734,"00:59:48,794","00:59:50,127",You don't have to change.
735,"00:59:50,228","00:59:52,628",I don't want you to change.
736,"01:00:00,429","01:00:03,964","I should have never asked her
to wear that scarf."
737,"01:00:22,898","01:00:24,266","Ah, yes."
738,"01:00:26,166","01:00:27,334",Well...
739,"01:00:28,434","01:00:30,234",Does it work?
740,"01:00:30,334","01:00:32,068",I only have a handful
741,"01:00:32,168","01:00:33,602","of fairy specimens
to work with..."
742,"01:00:33,702","01:00:36,069","and the extraction process
is painstaking."
743,"01:00:36,901","01:00:39,302",Extraction from what?
744,"01:00:39,403","01:00:41,870",Tomb Bloom flowers.
745,"01:00:41,970","01:00:43,037","They grow from
a fairy's grave,"
746,"01:00:43,137","01:00:44,870",contain their very essence.
747,"01:00:44,970","01:00:46,870","When you mix the pollen
with iron powder..."
748,"01:00:46,970","01:00:49,838","the resulting dust
ends a fairy's life."
749,"01:00:49,937","01:00:51,671",We will need thousands more.
750,"01:00:53,371","01:00:54,939",Show me.
751,"01:00:56,804","01:00:58,039",Show me.
752,"01:00:58,139","01:00:59,273",Very well.
753,"01:01:02,340","01:01:03,606",So...
754,"01:01:53,348","01:01:57,882","Finally,
the Moors will be mine."
755,"01:01:57,982","01:02:00,983",No more fairies.
756,"01:02:35,087","01:02:36,355","Stay alert, men."
757,"01:02:52,858","01:02:54,993",Wow!
758,"01:02:55,092","01:02:56,292","This is where
I found them."
759,"01:02:56,391","01:02:57,858",Excellent.
760,"01:02:57,959","01:02:59,726","But what if
the winged one returns?"
761,"01:02:59,826","01:03:01,893",Don't you worry about that.
762,"01:03:02,459","01:03:03,693",We'll be ready.
763,"01:03:03,793","01:03:05,027",Take the Tomb Blooms.
764,"01:03:05,694","01:03:07,628",Get to work!
765,"01:03:23,096","01:03:24,263","Sentries, stay alert!"
766,"01:03:24,363","01:03:25,963",Keep your weapons on hand.
767,"01:03:46,299","01:03:47,933",Move it!
768,"01:03:55,701","01:03:57,202",Maleficent...
769,"01:04:40,042","01:04:43,110","This is where
we bury our dead."
770,"01:04:44,143","01:04:46,244",They've destroyed it.
771,"01:04:50,843","01:04:53,077","This is what
the humans do."
772,"01:04:53,178","01:04:55,712","They're nothing but locusts
that swarm the earth."
773,"01:04:55,812","01:04:57,380",We have to stop them.
774,"01:04:59,713","01:05:03,080","You spent years
caring for a human..."
775,"01:05:03,179","01:05:06,279","now it's time
to care for your own."
776,"01:05:15,815","01:05:17,016",Fire!
777,"01:05:36,984","01:05:40,253",Reload! We go again!
778,"01:05:45,287","01:05:46,687",Fire!
779,"01:05:50,053","01:05:52,887","Reload!
There's another one!"
780,"01:07:09,499","01:07:11,267","Everyone, stay together!"
781,"01:07:11,367","01:07:13,168","We're about to leave
the Moors."
782,"01:07:13,268","01:07:14,902",Grab the hand or the wing...
783,"01:07:15,002","01:07:17,369","or the tail of whoever
is closest to you."
784,"01:07:59,242","01:08:01,910","Hey, over here!
Yeah, over here!"
785,"01:08:02,010","01:08:04,177","Hold formation, guards.
Hold formation."
786,"01:08:05,442","01:08:07,810","- Excuse me, sir.
- Stop right there."
787,"01:08:07,911","01:08:09,111",I'm with the bride.
788,"01:08:09,211","01:08:11,044","We've been told to let
the, uh, other kind"
789,"01:08:11,145","01:08:12,145",find their seats first.
790,"01:08:12,244","01:08:13,310",But I'm not a human.
791,"01:08:13,410","01:08:15,411","- I'm a raven.
- What?"
792,"01:08:15,511","01:08:18,078",A raven. The black bird.
793,"01:08:18,179","01:08:20,279",Mmm. This rice is delicious.
794,"01:08:20,378","01:08:21,946","You're supposed
to throw it"
795,"01:08:22,046","01:08:23,079",at the bride and groom.
796,"01:08:23,179","01:08:25,446",What? And waste good rice?
797,"01:08:25,546","01:08:26,881",What's the hold up?
798,"01:08:28,014","01:08:29,047",Let me in!
799,"01:08:29,147","01:08:31,247","Why can't humans come in, too?"
800,"01:08:32,881","01:08:34,416",Why can't we come in?
801,"01:08:41,848","01:08:42,882",I know it's bad luck...
802,"01:08:42,983","01:08:44,717",but I had to see you.
803,"01:08:46,283","01:08:47,451",For you.
804,"01:08:47,550","01:08:49,184",A Tomb Bloom?
805,"01:08:49,284","01:08:50,418",Where did you get this?
806,"01:08:50,518","01:08:52,085",From my mother.
807,"01:08:52,184","01:08:55,117","The sun's up.
It's our wedding day."
808,"01:09:02,352","01:09:05,020",From my mother.
809,"01:11:53,513","01:11:55,347","Where should we sit, Flittle?"
810,"01:11:55,448","01:11:57,716","On the left.
We're with the bride."
811,"01:11:57,815","01:11:59,148","Yes, we are."
812,"01:11:59,249","01:12:01,048","But the groom's lovely, too."
813,"01:12:01,149","01:12:03,116","Mmm. Yes, he is."
814,"01:12:03,883","01:12:05,482",I'm with both.
815,"01:12:05,583","01:12:07,949",Huh?
816,"01:12:14,251","01:12:16,318",Now.
817,"01:12:39,855","01:12:41,290",What's this?
818,"01:12:41,389","01:12:43,189","Nobody is allowed in here
except me."
819,"01:12:43,289","01:12:46,255","And I'm already here,
so go away!"
820,"01:13:04,258","01:13:06,059","Maleficent, please stop."
821,"01:13:12,960","01:13:14,762",Maleficent.
822,"01:13:14,861","01:13:16,260",She didn't do it.
823,"01:13:19,928","01:13:21,061",Get out!
824,"01:13:22,561","01:13:23,830",Before I call the guards!
825,"01:13:30,797","01:13:32,164",The missing fairies.
826,"01:13:32,263","01:13:33,430","I said get out.
Did you hear me?"
827,"01:13:33,530","01:13:36,299",What have you done?
828,"01:13:40,831","01:13:42,733",You're a pixie.
829,"01:13:42,833","01:13:43,999",How dare you call me that?
830,"01:13:44,099","01:13:46,100","I'm Lickspittle,
the nobleman..."
831,"01:13:46,200","01:13:48,767",and I serve the queen.
832,"01:13:48,867","01:13:51,101",She took your wings.
833,"01:13:54,301","01:13:56,469",We have to release them.
834,"01:13:56,568","01:13:58,135",They belong on the Moors.
835,"01:13:58,235","01:13:59,368","As you do, Aurora."
836,"01:14:01,336","01:14:05,070","A human who has betrayed
her kind."
837,"01:14:12,071","01:14:13,438","You put the curse
on the king."
838,"01:14:13,537","01:14:15,504","Oh, dear."
839,"01:14:15,605","01:14:18,005",You may be queen...
840,"01:14:18,104","01:14:19,505",but you are very young.
841,"01:14:19,606","01:14:22,806","Ruling humans is a bit
more complicated..."
842,"01:14:22,906","01:14:27,073","than running around barefoot
with flowers in your hair."
843,"01:14:29,807","01:14:31,974",When I was young...
844,"01:14:33,174","01:14:35,942","my family's kingdom
bordered the Moors."
845,"01:14:36,042","01:14:40,375","And one particularly
harsh winter..."
846,"01:14:40,474","01:14:42,075",our crops died...
847,"01:14:42,176","01:14:45,510","and the people
began to suffer."
848,"01:14:45,610","01:14:48,343","And as we looked
over our walls..."
849,"01:14:48,444","01:14:52,477","we could see
the fairies thriving."
850,"01:14:52,578","01:14:55,412","My brother and I believed we
should take what we needed..."
851,"01:14:55,511","01:15:01,811","while my father, the king,
sought their kindness."
852,"01:15:01,911","01:15:03,879","Choosing peace
over our people,"
853,"01:15:03,980","01:15:06,147","he sent my brother
to do his bidding."
854,"01:15:06,246","01:15:08,446",He never came back.
855,"01:15:09,913","01:15:11,247",Those savages...
856,"01:15:11,347","01:15:12,981","creatures who could
barely grunt,"
857,"01:15:13,080","01:15:16,115","let alone engage in talks,
killed him."
858,"01:15:16,215","01:15:17,782",I don't believe that.
859,"01:15:17,882","01:15:19,082",Our people became fearful.
860,"01:15:19,182","01:15:21,783",They overthrew my father.
861,"01:15:21,882","01:15:25,484","The land fell into chaos.
I was cast out."
862,"01:15:25,583","01:15:30,783","Forced by fate into marriage
with King John of Ulstead."
863,"01:15:30,883","01:15:32,384",Another weak king
864,"01:15:32,483","01:15:35,151","speaking of
tolerance and civility."
865,"01:15:35,252","01:15:37,485","And now, my own son..."
866,"01:15:37,586","01:15:41,486","corrupted with visions
of harmony."
867,"01:15:41,586","01:15:44,353","But peace
will not be our downfall."
868,"01:15:49,420","01:15:51,287",Now lock her up.
869,"01:15:52,353","01:15:54,354",A war is coming.
870,"01:16:00,054","01:16:02,189",No! No!
871,"01:16:10,322","01:16:13,091","I wish you could be here
with me."
872,"01:16:21,991","01:16:23,760",Conall wanted peace...
873,"01:16:25,892","01:16:28,526",and they filled him with iron.
874,"01:16:30,026","01:16:32,460","Now, we will have our war."
875,"01:16:34,494","01:16:37,395",Our fight begins now!
876,"01:16:37,495","01:16:40,262",We will rise together!
877,"01:16:40,362","01:16:42,896",We fight together.
878,"01:16:42,995","01:16:47,362","And we will show them
no mercy!"
879,"01:17:04,199","01:17:06,466",Come on! Go!
880,"01:17:10,866","01:17:13,800",Go! Go!
881,"01:17:13,901","01:17:16,435",Go! Go! Go!
882,"01:17:30,170","01:17:32,071",Where are all Philip's guests?
883,"01:17:32,170","01:17:34,438","- Humans are poor timekeepers.
- Mmm."
884,"01:18:01,042","01:18:03,376",Start the music.
885,"01:18:20,646","01:18:22,813",Come on! Come on!
886,"01:19:26,889","01:19:28,055",She's gone.
887,"01:19:29,489","01:19:30,490",Hey!
888,"01:19:40,959","01:19:43,393",It's a trap! Get down!
889,"01:20:02,094","01:20:03,495",Your Majesty...
890,"01:20:04,561","01:20:07,164",they're coming from the sea.
891,"01:20:16,630","01:20:17,831",She escaped!
892,"01:20:24,265","01:20:26,400","Down this way, come on!"
893,"01:20:33,932","01:20:35,434",Your Highness.
894,"01:20:35,534","01:20:37,102",Upon my command.
895,"01:20:47,936","01:20:49,070",Check every room!
896,"01:20:51,236","01:20:52,371",She can't be far!
897,"01:21:25,176","01:21:26,310",Wait.
898,"01:21:27,610","01:21:29,075",Wait.
899,"01:21:52,480","01:21:54,280",What's going on?
900,"01:21:58,481","01:21:59,882",Now.
901,"01:21:59,981","01:22:00,948",Fire!
902,"01:22:09,982","01:22:11,583",No!
903,"01:22:38,221","01:22:40,422",They look just like her.
904,"01:22:44,455","01:22:46,023",Withdraw!
905,"01:22:46,122","01:22:48,256",Withdraw!
906,"01:22:49,089","01:22:50,924",Pull back!
907,"01:22:51,023","01:22:52,290","Maleficent's
starting a war."
908,"01:22:52,390","01:22:54,490","First my father,
and now this."
909,"01:22:54,591","01:22:57,058","Philip!
She didn't curse him."
910,"01:22:57,157","01:22:59,158","- Maleficent.
- What?"
911,"01:22:59,257","01:23:01,192",She never cursed him.
912,"01:23:02,125","01:23:03,926",It was your mother.
913,"01:23:04,026","01:23:05,159",What are you saying?
914,"01:23:05,258","01:23:06,525",It was the spindle.
915,"01:23:11,627","01:23:13,360",The curse is still in it.
916,"01:23:13,460","01:23:16,361","Your mother used it
against your father."
917,"01:23:18,028","01:23:19,461",Look.
918,"01:23:21,927","01:23:23,395",It's the same.
919,"01:23:23,496","01:23:26,230","She's locked the Moor folk
in the chapel."
920,"01:23:26,329","01:23:27,830",This isn't a wedding.
921,"01:23:27,930","01:23:30,064",It's a trap.
922,"01:23:34,363","01:23:37,597","Remember where
you came from."
923,"01:23:37,698","01:23:40,131",Remember who you are.
924,"01:23:43,132","01:23:45,233",I've made my choice.
925,"01:23:46,132","01:23:48,300",You'll have to make yours.
926,"01:24:16,470","01:24:18,170",Stay low!
927,"01:24:20,204","01:24:21,438",Divide!
928,"01:24:23,638","01:24:25,305",Follow me!
929,"01:24:34,107","01:24:35,274",Attack!
930,"01:24:36,507","01:24:38,042",Attack!
931,"01:24:48,943","01:24:51,110","- Ignite!
- Ignite!"
932,"01:25:01,012","01:25:02,312",No!
933,"01:25:46,653","01:25:48,153",Aunties! Aunties!
934,"01:25:51,086","01:25:52,487",It's too heavy!
935,"01:25:53,653","01:25:55,054",Aurora!
936,"01:25:55,155","01:25:56,387",Diaval! You're here.
937,"01:25:59,420","01:26:02,088","Oh, what's happening?"
938,"01:26:21,691","01:26:23,292",Weapon change!
939,"01:26:25,091","01:26:26,358",Weapon change! Go!
940,"01:27:06,565","01:27:07,566",Mother!
941,"01:27:08,365","01:27:10,000",You have to stop this.
942,"01:27:10,099","01:27:11,400",We are at war.
943,"01:27:11,499","01:27:13,433","This isn't a war.
It's a massacre."
944,"01:27:13,533","01:27:15,200","Philip,
you don't understand."
945,"01:27:15,300","01:27:18,068","These creatures stand
between us..."
946,"01:27:18,167","01:27:20,935","and everything
we need to survive."
947,"01:27:21,035","01:27:22,202",You're wrong.
948,"01:27:22,302","01:27:23,536",We can stand together.
949,"01:27:23,636","01:27:26,469","Well, you're a fool
to believe that."
950,"01:27:26,569","01:27:30,237","You don't know what it takes
to fight for our kind."
951,"01:27:31,003","01:27:32,403",You lied to me.
952,"01:27:33,236","01:27:35,438",I am protecting the kingdom...
953,"01:27:35,537","01:27:38,071",and your throne.
954,"01:27:38,172","01:27:39,439",What about Father?
955,"01:27:41,037","01:27:44,205","Were you protecting him, too?"
956,"01:27:46,272","01:27:48,906","The prince
is not feeling well."
957,"01:27:49,972","01:27:51,705",See him to his chambers.
958,"01:27:55,573","01:27:56,574",Now.
959,"01:28:01,107","01:28:02,909","Sire, stop!"
960,"01:28:29,213","01:28:31,614",Yield! Yield!
961,"01:28:31,713","01:28:33,014",My mother cursed the king
962,"01:28:33,113","01:28:34,113","so she could destroy
the Moor folk."
963,"01:28:34,214","01:28:36,013","Your men are paying
heavily for it."
964,"01:28:42,949","01:28:45,283",We have to do something!
965,"01:28:48,949","01:28:50,349","Goodbye, girls."
966,"01:28:51,450","01:28:53,618","No, come back!"
967,"01:28:53,717","01:28:55,517",Flittle! No!
968,"01:29:08,152","01:29:09,354",No!
969,"01:29:09,453","01:29:11,987","Hey, you,
stay with your own!"
970,"01:29:12,086","01:29:13,620","Run, Aurora, run!"
971,"01:29:13,721","01:29:15,254",Let him go!
972,"01:29:20,021","01:29:22,256",No! No!
973,"01:29:49,192","01:29:51,027",Godmother.
974,"01:30:49,169","01:30:50,970",For Flittle!
975,"01:30:59,338","01:31:02,171",We've got her!
976,"01:31:16,573","01:31:17,575",Huh?
977,"01:31:48,646","01:31:50,346",Go! Go!
978,"01:31:50,445","01:31:53,147",This way! This way!
979,"01:31:53,246","01:31:54,346",Go!
980,"01:32:37,320","01:32:38,922",Stand down!
981,"01:32:40,421","01:32:42,489",This is not my fight.
982,"01:32:42,588","01:32:45,421","My mother wanted a war,
and you're giving it to her."
983,"01:32:46,754","01:32:50,389","I won't allow her hatred
to ruin my kingdom or yours."
984,"01:33:08,325","01:33:10,360","There will be no Fey blood
on my hands."
985,"01:33:32,095","01:33:34,063","This way!
This way!"
986,"01:33:36,097","01:33:38,264",Maleficent's back!
987,"01:33:42,698","01:33:45,331",She's going for the queen.
988,"01:33:51,066","01:33:52,999",Yield! Yield!
989,"01:33:53,100","01:33:54,100",Stand down!
990,"01:33:54,199","01:33:55,533",Lower your weapons!
991,"01:34:07,535","01:34:10,569","There's the evil
that I promised them."
992,"01:34:13,770","01:34:16,704","Your kind is more predictable
than humans."
993,"01:34:23,237","01:34:24,405",Stop!
994,"01:34:25,171","01:34:26,139",Stop!
995,"01:34:26,238","01:34:28,605","Well, almost."
996,"01:34:28,705","01:34:29,705",Stop.
997,"01:34:30,672","01:34:33,172","I'm sorry I doubted you,
but this isn't you."
998,"01:34:33,272","01:34:35,173",There's another way.
999,"01:34:35,274","01:34:36,507",I know who you are.
1000,"01:34:39,040","01:34:41,674",I know you.
1001,"01:34:41,774","01:34:43,408",You do not.
1002,"01:34:45,708","01:34:48,342","Yes, I do."
1003,"01:34:48,443","01:34:50,476",You're my mother.
1004,"01:35:25,515","01:35:26,716",No!
1005,"01:35:42,385","01:35:46,186","Do you know what makes a great
leader, Aurora?"
1006,"01:35:46,284","01:35:49,352","The ability to instill fear
in your subjects..."
1007,"01:35:49,453","01:35:50,720",and then use that fear...
1008,"01:35:50,820","01:35:52,154",Your Majesty.
1009,"01:35:53,386","01:35:55,687",...against your enemies.
1010,"01:35:55,788","01:35:58,321",So...
1011,"01:35:58,420","01:36:01,987","I spread the story
of the evil witch..."
1012,"01:36:02,087","01:36:05,388",and the princess she cursed.
1013,"01:36:05,488","01:36:10,156","It didn't matter
who woke Sleeping Beauty."
1014,"01:36:10,255","01:36:12,222",They were all terrified.
1015,"01:36:12,323","01:36:15,523",And the story became legend.
1016,"01:36:17,690","01:36:20,291","I know you think
I'm a monster."
1017,"01:36:20,390","01:36:26,124","But what I did to the king,
to Maleficent, to my son..."
1018,"01:36:26,224","01:36:29,193",I did for Ulstead.
1019,"01:36:29,292","01:36:32,025","You are a traitor
to your kind,"
1020,"01:36:32,125","01:36:33,726",and you will pay for it.
1021,"01:36:34,760","01:36:37,227",Maleficent is dead!
1022,"01:36:39,659","01:36:42,727","We will never again
live in fear!"
1023,"01:36:42,828","01:36:44,628",Get back here!
1024,"01:36:48,396","01:36:50,697",Ulstead is free at last!
1025,"01:36:50,796","01:36:53,629",Let me go!
1026,"01:37:02,230","01:37:03,464",What's happening?
1027,"01:40:28,798","01:40:30,665","Well, well."
1028,"01:40:31,665","01:40:33,767","Hello, Beasty."
1029,"01:40:52,368","01:40:53,535",I missed you.
1030,"01:40:55,235","01:40:57,169","Did you bump
your head, then?"
1031,"01:40:57,269","01:40:58,470",I did.
1032,"01:41:01,303","01:41:03,104",Philip.
1033,"01:41:03,205","01:41:04,604",Yes?
1034,"01:41:06,338","01:41:08,406",Do you love my daughter?
1035,"01:41:11,238","01:41:12,573",With everything I have.
1036,"01:41:21,706","01:41:23,175",Good.
1037,"01:41:31,543","01:41:34,777",I believe this belongs to you.
1038,"01:41:41,410","01:41:43,644",Curses don't end.
1039,"01:41:43,743","01:41:45,544",They're broken.
1040,"01:42:10,781","01:42:12,616",It ends.
1041,"01:42:18,549","01:42:20,751","There will be
no more fighting."
1042,"01:42:20,851","01:42:23,752","Ulstead will never attack
the Moors again."
1043,"01:42:23,852","01:42:25,352",And from this day on...
1044,"01:42:25,851","01:42:28,386",we move forward...
1045,"01:42:28,486","01:42:31,020",and find our way...
1046,"01:42:32,086","01:42:33,753",in peace.
1047,"01:42:33,854","01:42:35,487",Together.
1048,"01:42:38,554","01:42:41,321","Today,
there will be a wedding."
1049,"01:42:41,420","01:42:44,755","Not just a union
of two people..."
1050,"01:42:44,854","01:42:48,056",but a union of two kingdoms.
1051,"01:42:48,155","01:42:49,654",And all are invited...
1052,"01:42:50,688","01:42:52,722",all are safe...
1053,"01:42:52,822","01:42:55,090",and all are welcome.
1054,"01:43:29,160","01:43:30,796","Hello, there."
1055,"01:44:11,635","01:44:14,802","We cannot live
amongst monsters..."
1056,"01:44:20,304","01:44:23,571","Someone should
really cover those horns."
1057,"01:44:40,440","01:44:42,441",If only Conall could see you.
1058,"01:44:44,540","01:44:45,542",Borra...
1059,"01:44:47,474","01:44:50,142",it's time to come home.
1060,"01:44:56,310","01:44:57,711",Hello.
1061,"01:44:59,309","01:45:01,444",Can you come here?
1062,"01:45:11,712","01:45:12,812",Yes?
1063,"01:45:14,745","01:45:16,781",Will you give me away?
1064,"01:45:16,880","01:45:18,514",Never.
1065,"01:45:19,446","01:45:21,380",No.
1066,"01:45:21,481","01:45:23,347","Will you walk me
down the aisle?"
1067,"01:45:23,448","01:45:25,349",Ah.
1068,"01:45:27,615","01:45:28,616",Yes.
1069,"01:45:51,752","01:45:54,319","Apologies to anyone
I might have mauled today."
1070,"01:46:06,386","01:46:07,554",Is that...?
1071,"01:46:08,287","01:46:10,288",She can change her back.
1072,"01:46:10,821","01:46:12,322",I suppose.
1073,"01:46:12,421","01:46:16,289",Only if we wanted to.
1074,"01:46:16,390","01:46:18,057",Father.
1075,"01:46:22,524","01:46:24,658",I'm so glad to see you.
1076,"01:46:24,758","01:46:27,159","I've dreamed
of this moment."
1077,"01:46:27,258","01:46:30,093","Two kingdoms
united at last."
1078,"01:46:30,192","01:46:32,659",And it's because of you.
1079,"01:46:32,758","01:46:35,794","I'm so proud of you.
So proud."
1080,"01:47:04,631","01:47:06,230","She looks better
in green."
1081,"01:47:06,331","01:47:07,532","Pink, you mean."
1082,"01:47:10,731","01:47:12,398","No, in green."
1083,"01:47:12,499","01:47:13,532",Pink.
1084,"01:47:13,633","01:47:15,067","- Green.
- Pink."
1085,"01:47:18,165","01:47:19,433",Flittle!
1086,"01:47:19,534","01:47:22,068",It's perfect.
1087,"01:48:06,241","01:48:08,276",Let her go.
1088,"01:48:21,545","01:48:24,311",Pull yourself together.
1089,"01:48:24,410","01:48:27,644","We are here to join
two kingdoms..."
1090,"01:48:27,745","01:48:29,478",divided by fear.
1091,"01:48:30,211","01:48:31,813","Today, you teach us"
1092,"01:48:31,912","01:48:35,279","we are not defined
by where we are from..."
1093,"01:48:35,379","01:48:37,647",but by whom we love.
1094,"01:48:39,678","01:48:41,713","The bands, please."
1095,"01:48:56,682","01:48:58,651","Do you, Philip,
take Aurora..."
1096,"01:48:58,751","01:48:59,516",I do.
1097,"01:49:01,316","01:49:02,584","And do you,
Aurora, take..."
1098,"01:49:02,684","01:49:04,185",I do.
1099,"01:49:04,284","01:49:07,752","Then I pronounce you
husband and wife."
1100,"01:49:07,851","01:49:10,352",You may kiss the bride.
1101,"01:49:40,823","01:49:41,825",You're smiling.
1102,"01:50:04,793","01:50:06,594",It's a new day.
1103,"01:50:08,894","01:50:10,728",It is.
1104,"01:50:22,297","01:50:23,465",Morning.
1105,"01:50:24,229","01:50:26,364",Will you stay awhile?
1106,"01:50:26,464","01:50:28,132",A little while.
1107,"01:50:28,231","01:50:30,165",But don't worry...
1108,"01:50:30,264","01:50:32,731","I'll see you
at the christening."
1109,"01:50:49,735","01:50:50,735",Hmm.
1110,"01:50:51,902","01:50:53,603",Hmm.
