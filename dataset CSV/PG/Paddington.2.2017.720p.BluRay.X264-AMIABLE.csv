1,"00:00:47,710","00:00:50,918",Our last rainy season.
2,"00:00:51,001","00:00:53,043","Just think, Pastuzo."
3,"00:00:53,126","00:00:55,835","This time next month,
we'll be in London."
4,"00:00:55,918","00:01:01,793","Where the rivers run with marmalade
and the streets are paved with bread."
5,"00:01:01,876","00:01:03,835",Did you read the book about London?
6,"00:01:03,918","00:01:06,918","- I skimmed it.
- Oh, Pastuzo!"
7,"00:01:07,001","00:01:09,918","Well, reading makes me sleepy."
8,"00:01:10,001","00:01:12,043","But any city
that can come up with this..."
9,"00:01:12,126","00:01:14,501",...is all right by me.
10,"00:01:16,418","00:01:18,751","Ooh. Pastuzo, look!"
11,"00:01:20,876","00:01:23,168",It's... It's a cub!
12,"00:01:23,293","00:01:24,918",Lucy!
13,"00:01:25,001","00:01:26,960",Lower me down.
14,"00:01:27,085","00:01:28,918",Be careful.
15,"00:01:40,876","00:01:43,210","Lower, Pastuzo. Lower!"
16,"00:01:58,960","00:02:01,543",Lucy.
17,"00:02:02,085","00:02:03,085",Lucy!
18,"00:02:03,626","00:02:07,085","I'm afraid we're not going to London
after all."
19,"00:02:07,626","00:02:09,043",Why not?
20,"00:02:09,126","00:02:11,210",We've got a cub to raise.
21,"00:02:12,418","00:02:13,751",What's he like?
22,"00:02:13,835","00:02:16,210",Rather small.
23,"00:02:16,335","00:02:17,918",And rather sneezy.
24,"00:02:19,543","00:02:21,918",But he likes his marmalade.
25,"00:02:22,001","00:02:24,293",That's a good sign.
26,"00:02:24,418","00:02:26,293","Oh, yes, Pastuzo."
27,"00:02:26,418","00:02:31,710","If we look after this bear,
I have a feeling he'll go far."
28,"00:02:51,501","00:02:52,960","Dear Aunt Lucy,"
29,"00:02:53,043","00:02:55,543","I hope all is well
in the Home for Retired Bears."
30,"00:02:56,251","00:02:58,585","Life in London has been
better than ever this summer."
31,"00:02:59,251","00:03:02,335","I've really got to grips
with how things work."
32,"00:03:07,043","00:03:08,126",Aaah!
33,"00:03:08,210","00:03:10,543","And it seems there's something new
to do every day."
34,"00:03:10,626","00:03:11,626",Hm.
35,"00:03:11,710","00:03:14,376","Guess what, Paddington.
The steam fair's coming to town."
36,"00:03:14,460","00:03:16,835","I'm going along tonight
to write about it in my newspaper."
37,"00:03:16,918","00:03:18,585",Who's going to want to read about that?
38,"00:03:18,668","00:03:21,501","Everyone. They travel the world
in an old steam train."
39,"00:03:21,585","00:03:22,710",I thought you'd love it.
40,"00:03:22,793","00:03:25,876","I do. Don't tell anyone, OK? Not cool."
41,"00:03:25,960","00:03:27,626","- Why don't we all go?
- Good idea."
42,"00:03:27,710","00:03:29,751","Your father's a dab hand
at the coconut shy."
43,"00:03:29,835","00:03:32,210","- Bullseye Brown they used to call him.
- Not any more."
44,"00:03:32,335","00:03:33,918",Coconuts are a young man's game.
45,"00:03:34,001","00:03:37,168","Well, I think you're in great shape
for a man your age, Mr Brown."
46,"00:03:37,251","00:03:40,251","Ah, thank you, Paddington.
Hang on, how old do you think I am?"
47,"00:03:40,376","00:03:42,460","Oh, er, about 80."
48,"00:03:43,251","00:03:45,251","- Eighty?
- At least."
49,"00:03:45,376","00:03:47,960","- Just a minute, young bear.
- Hm?"
50,"00:03:48,043","00:03:50,626","Thought I told you
to wash behind your ears."
51,"00:03:50,710","00:03:52,918","Oh, but I did, Mrs Bird. I..."
52,"00:03:53,001","00:03:55,126",I wonder how that got in there.
53,"00:03:55,251","00:03:57,335","I really feel at home
in Windsor Gardens."
54,"00:03:57,418","00:04:00,793","- Bonjour, mademoiselle!
- Good morning, Paddington."
55,"00:04:00,876","00:04:03,210","- I brought you breakfast.
- Thank you."
56,"00:04:03,335","00:04:05,501","Your sandwiches
always put me in a good mood."
57,"00:04:05,585","00:04:08,543","Morning, Dr Jafri.
Haven't forgotten your keys, have you?"
58,"00:04:08,626","00:04:12,085","Keys? Keys! Oh, oh!"
59,"00:04:12,168","00:04:14,543","- Well caught.
- Thank you, Paddington."
60,"00:04:14,626","00:04:16,960","You're welcome. Glorious day, Colonel."
61,"00:04:17,043","00:04:20,043",Is it? How absolutely thrilling.
62,"00:04:20,126","00:04:21,626","How was your date, Miss Kitts?"
63,"00:04:21,751","00:04:24,001","Well, he wasn't the one,
but you know what they say."
64,"00:04:24,085","00:04:26,626","- Plenty more fish in the sea.
- Exactly."
65,"00:04:26,710","00:04:27,710",Thank you!
66,"00:04:31,085","00:04:33,668","- Morning, Paddington.
- Morning, Mr Barnes."
67,"00:04:33,751","00:04:36,001","- Bye, Paddington.
- Au revoir, mademoiselle."
68,"00:04:36,085","00:04:37,793","Right, test me."
69,"00:04:37,876","00:04:40,460","What's the quickest way
from Baker Street to Big Ben?"
70,"00:04:40,543","00:04:41,543","Ah, an easy one."
71,"00:04:42,085","00:04:44,126",Turn right onto Portman Square. Left...
72,"00:04:44,210","00:04:46,335","Everyone has been so kind
and welcoming,"
73,"00:04:46,418","00:04:48,043",even though they're very busy.
74,"00:04:49,418","00:04:51,626",Mrs Brown is planning to swim to France.
75,"00:04:52,585","00:04:54,293",It seems an awful lot of hard work
76,"00:04:54,376","00:04:58,751","when you can go by boat or plane
or even train. But that's not the point."
77,"00:04:58,876","00:05:00,543",She's been cooped up all summer
78,"00:05:00,626","00:05:03,460","illustrating a series
of adventure stories"
79,"00:05:03,543","00:05:05,876","and has decided
she wants one of her own."
80,"00:05:06,501","00:05:07,793",Whoo-hoo!
81,"00:05:09,335","00:05:11,793","Judy has been suffering
from a broken heart."
82,"00:05:11,876","00:05:15,335","I'm dumped? I think you'll find
you're dumped, Tony."
83,"00:05:15,460","00:05:17,751",Her first reaction was to become a nun.
84,"00:05:17,835","00:05:22,251","But she soon got over that
and has thrown herself into a new hobby."
85,"00:05:22,335","00:05:26,376","She found an old printing press
at school and is starting a newspaper,"
86,"00:05:26,460","00:05:27,501",with no boys.
87,"00:05:27,585","00:05:29,710",Now all we need is some news.
88,"00:05:30,210","00:05:32,376","Jonathan is joining her
at big school this year."
89,"00:05:32,501","00:05:34,126",He spent the holidays
90,"00:05:34,293","00:05:36,501","- building a fully working steam engine.
- Whoo!"
91,"00:05:36,585","00:05:39,543","But I'm not supposed to talk about that
as it's ""not cool""."
92,"00:05:39,626","00:05:42,043",He's got a whole new look
93,"00:05:42,126","00:05:45,376","and if anyone asks,
he's now called J-Dog"
94,"00:05:45,501","00:05:48,585","and he's definitely not
into steam trains."
95,"00:05:48,751","00:05:52,126","- Those times...
- But Mr Brown has been busiest of all."
96,"00:05:52,251","00:05:54,251",He recently had a surprise at work.
97,"00:05:54,335","00:05:59,251","I am delighted to announce
our new head of risk analysis will be..."
98,"00:05:59,376","00:06:02,668",Mr Steve Visby.
99,"00:06:04,001","00:06:08,835","And this has prompted what Mrs Bird
calls ""a full-blown midlife crisis""."
100,"00:06:08,918","00:06:11,793","It involves blending his food,"
101,"00:06:11,876","00:06:13,960","painting his hair,"
102,"00:06:14,085","00:06:16,918","and engaging in a process
called chakrabatics."
103,"00:06:17,001","00:06:20,126","Open your mind
and your legs will follow."
104,"00:06:21,793","00:06:24,501","- Thank you, Paddington.
- Keep up the good work."
105,"00:06:25,460","00:06:28,585","Oh, Aunt Lucy,
you sent me to London to find a home,"
106,"00:06:28,668","00:06:31,293","and it's worked out better
than I ever imagined."
107,"00:06:31,376","00:06:32,793",I have a wonderful family.
108,"00:06:33,918","00:06:36,126","And have made friends
in all sorts of places."
109,"00:06:36,251","00:06:37,251","Here, boy."
110,"00:06:38,085","00:06:40,918","There you go, Wolfie."
111,"00:06:41,376","00:06:44,501","I do hope if you could see me,
you'd be pleased."
112,"00:06:44,585","00:06:47,960","Lots of love, from Paddington."
113,"00:06:48,043","00:06:50,751","- Mr Gruber?
- Ah, Mr Brown, come in."
114,"00:06:50,835","00:06:55,085","I just had a visit from Madame Kozlova
who runs the fair."
115,"00:06:55,210","00:06:57,460","- Oh, yes?
- They were having a clear-out"
116,"00:06:57,585","00:07:01,918","and found all these old crates
stuffed full with ""memory-bilia"""
117,"00:07:02,001","00:07:04,043",they thought had been lost forever.
118,"00:07:04,168","00:07:07,085","She asked me if I would sell it
for them while they're in town."
119,"00:07:07,210","00:07:10,168","And it struck me
there might be something in here"
120,"00:07:10,251","00:07:11,918",for your auntie's birthday.
121,"00:07:12,001","00:07:13,418","Oh, good idea."
122,"00:07:14,793","00:07:16,751","Ah, look at this!"
123,"00:07:19,043","00:07:23,543","- It's very nice, Mr Gruber, but...
- I know, I know, it has to be perfect."
124,"00:07:23,626","00:07:27,210","Well, since Uncle Pastuzo died,
I'm the only relative she's got left."
125,"00:07:27,293","00:07:29,418","And it isn't every day
a bear turns a hundred."
126,"00:07:29,501","00:07:31,293",Quite so. Ah!
127,"00:07:31,960","00:07:34,751",How about these rolling shoes?
128,"00:07:34,835","00:07:36,710","Please, Mr Gruber, be serious."
129,"00:07:36,793","00:07:39,835","Perhaps your auntie's rolling days
are behind her."
130,"00:07:39,918","00:07:42,001",I think you might be right.
131,"00:07:42,085","00:07:45,335","- Oh, what's this?
- Ah!"
132,"00:07:45,418","00:07:48,668","That must be the popping book.
Very interesting."
133,"00:07:48,751","00:07:49,751",Really?
134,"00:07:49,835","00:07:52,751","You see,
Madame Kozlova's great-grandmother,"
135,"00:07:52,835","00:07:56,418","who started the fair,
was also a brilliant artist."
136,"00:07:56,501","00:08:00,210","And every time they visited a new city,
she made a popping book"
137,"00:08:00,293","00:08:02,501","- to remember it by.
- Ohh."
138,"00:08:02,626","00:08:04,751",And this is London.
139,"00:08:10,626","00:08:14,168","Oh, Mr Gruber, it's wonderful."
140,"00:08:14,918","00:08:17,668","Aunt Lucy always dreamed
of coming to London and..."
141,"00:08:17,751","00:08:20,918","never had the chance.
But if she saw this..."
142,"00:08:22,001","00:08:24,543",it would be like she were finally here.
143,"00:08:30,043","00:08:31,668",Oh!
144,"00:08:31,751","00:08:34,335",Aunt Lucy! Aunt Lucy!
145,"00:08:34,418","00:08:36,793",Paddington!
146,"00:08:36,876","00:08:37,960",Oop.
147,"00:08:45,501","00:08:47,793","Come with me, Aunt Lucy."
148,"00:08:47,876","00:08:52,835","Oh, yes, please.
I want to see everything."
149,"00:08:52,918","00:08:54,043",It's just down here.
150,"00:08:54,126","00:08:56,251","Get all your racing news
right here."
151,"00:08:56,335","00:08:59,793","- Well, what do you think?
- It's wonderful."
152,"00:08:59,876","00:09:02,918","Right here, ladies and gents..."
153,"00:09:03,001","00:09:04,418",All aboard!
154,"00:09:04,501","00:09:06,418","One and a half bears, please."
155,"00:09:06,501","00:09:10,626","- Mind your step, madam.
- Oh. What a polite young man."
156,"00:09:12,543","00:09:15,710",What a polite young pigeon.
157,"00:09:15,793","00:09:19,293",It's so echoey. Echoes around.
158,"00:09:20,585","00:09:23,376",Sides turning!
159,"00:09:25,751","00:09:31,960","Oh, Paddington,
you've made an old bear so very happy."
160,"00:09:32,585","00:09:34,626",This is perfect.
161,"00:09:35,251","00:09:37,293","- Ahh.
- Ahh?"
162,"00:09:37,376","00:09:39,918","- We have a snag.
- Do we?"
163,"00:09:40,001","00:09:43,668","You see, this popping book
is the only one of its kind."
164,"00:09:43,751","00:09:46,418","and they want
rather a lot of money for it."
165,"00:09:46,501","00:09:50,168","Oh, well, Mrs Bird found this coin
in my ear at breakfast."
166,"00:09:50,251","00:09:51,460",Perhaps there's more.
167,"00:09:51,543","00:09:54,585","It would take
more than an earful, Mr Brown."
168,"00:09:54,710","00:09:58,001","I'm afraid you would need
a thousand of those coins."
169,"00:09:58,126","00:09:59,460",Oh.
170,"00:09:59,543","00:10:03,376","Let's take another look at the monkey.
I think he's super-duper."
171,"00:10:04,876","00:10:07,501","- Oh!
- I can fix that."
172,"00:10:07,626","00:10:10,001","That's very kind, Mr Gruber, but..."
173,"00:10:10,085","00:10:12,751","Aunt Lucy did so much for me
when I was a cub"
174,"00:10:12,835","00:10:15,710","and this could be my way
of saying thank you."
175,"00:10:16,376","00:10:19,668","I'm going to get a job
and buy that book."
176,"00:10:19,751","00:10:22,710","Back in a few minutes,
Paddington. Ciao ciao."
177,"00:10:22,793","00:10:24,960","Ciao ciao, Mr Giuseppe."
178,"00:10:26,668","00:10:30,501","Good afternoon.
Welcome to Giuseppe's grooming salon."
179,"00:10:30,585","00:10:33,960","What can I do for you today, sir?
A shave? A light pomade?"
180,"00:10:34,043","00:10:35,210",Or is it just a brush?
181,"00:10:36,793","00:10:38,251","Quick trim, barber."
182,"00:10:38,376","00:10:40,293","Oh, I'm not the barber. I just tidy up."
183,"00:10:40,376","00:10:43,960","Yeah, well, that's all I want. Tidy up
the back and sides. Nothing off the top."
184,"00:10:44,085","00:10:47,085","- Yes, but...
- No ""buts"". Come on, man, chop chop."
185,"00:10:47,835","00:10:50,210","If you say so, sir."
186,"00:10:50,293","00:10:51,793",Oh...
187,"00:10:52,876","00:10:55,251",Hmm... Ah!
188,"00:10:58,126","00:10:59,126",Hmm...
189,"00:10:59,960","00:11:02,251",On. Whoa!
190,"00:11:22,876","00:11:25,126",G-G-Giuse-e-e-eppe's?
191,"00:11:25,710","00:11:28,251","W-W-Would you mi-i-ind
if I call you ba-ack?"
192,"00:11:29,085","00:11:33,126","I think I ma-ay be about to sha-ave
a customer."
193,"00:11:33,251","00:11:35,751","Oop. Oh, thanks goodness."
194,"00:11:39,918","00:11:42,876",Just putting you on hold!
195,"00:11:45,043","00:11:48,210","- But I don't want to.
- It's only a haircut, Nelson."
196,"00:11:48,293","00:11:50,918",There's nothing to be afraid of.
197,"00:11:51,001","00:11:52,585",Come in. Take a seat.
198,"00:11:53,376","00:11:56,626",We'll go somewhere else.
199,"00:12:01,460","00:12:02,876","Ooh, that's not good."
200,"00:12:03,918","00:12:06,626",Ooh. Um...
201,"00:12:07,376","00:12:08,835",Um...
202,"00:12:10,418","00:12:12,710",No. Um...
203,"00:12:13,751","00:12:14,876",Ah!
204,"00:12:17,001","00:12:20,376",Well...
205,"00:12:22,626","00:12:24,751","Just giving you some product, sir."
206,"00:12:24,835","00:12:28,126","Ah, jolly good. Carry on."
207,"00:12:28,710","00:12:30,168",All done.
208,"00:12:31,085","00:12:33,793","I must say, it's turned out
a lot better than I expected."
209,"00:12:39,543","00:12:42,168",What... What the devil's that?
210,"00:12:42,251","00:12:44,376","It's, er, marmalade."
211,"00:12:45,210","00:12:46,293",Marmalade?
212,"00:12:46,418","00:12:50,460","- Hairy marmalade.
- Well, get it off!"
213,"00:12:50,543","00:12:52,001","Yes, sir. Right away, sir."
214,"00:12:52,918","00:12:55,751","Oh, yuck! What is the matter with you?"
215,"00:12:55,835","00:12:58,418","- Paddington!
- Mr Giuseppe. I can explain..."
216,"00:12:58,501","00:13:03,626",It's really not as bad as it looks.
217,"00:13:04,876","00:13:06,793","Have you ever been fired, Mr Brown?"
218,"00:13:06,876","00:13:11,585","Well, no, but are you quite sure you're
ready for the workplace, Paddington?"
219,"00:13:11,668","00:13:14,085","It's a tough,
competitive world out there"
220,"00:13:14,168","00:13:17,793","and I worry a good-natured little bear
might get trampled underfoot."
221,"00:13:17,876","00:13:20,001","He's right, you know.
You can't trust anyone."
222,"00:13:20,085","00:13:22,085","That's why
I'm doing my newspaper alone."
223,"00:13:22,168","00:13:24,168","Darling, is this about Tony?"
224,"00:13:24,251","00:13:26,376","- No!
- Everything's about Tony."
225,"00:13:26,460","00:13:29,251","The reason no one's helping
with your paper is because it's so lame."
226,"00:13:29,335","00:13:31,626","Well, at least I'm not pretending
to be someone I'm not."
227,"00:13:31,710","00:13:33,460",Nor am I. G-Man!
228,"00:13:33,543","00:13:35,710","- J-Dog.
- Spud bounce."
229,"00:13:35,793","00:13:38,876","But Aunt Lucy said, ""If we're kind
and polite, the world will be right."""
230,"00:13:39,001","00:13:41,043","- At least someone's making sense.
- Oh, sorry."
231,"00:13:41,168","00:13:43,918","And you're kind, Mr Brown,
and you made it to the top."
232,"00:13:44,001","00:13:46,668","I'm nowhere near the top.
I peaked in the middle."
233,"00:13:46,751","00:13:50,668","Now my hair's gone grey, my belly's
popped out, and I've started to creak."
234,"00:13:50,751","00:13:52,251",Oh!
235,"00:13:52,335","00:13:54,710","Doesn't that man live in the big house
on the corner?"
236,"00:13:54,793","00:13:57,543","- It's Phoenix Buchanan.
- Dad's celebrity client."
237,"00:13:57,626","00:13:59,585",He's one of our Platinum Club members.
238,"00:13:59,668","00:14:01,668",And a very famous actor.
239,"00:14:01,751","00:14:03,626",Or used to be.
240,"00:14:03,710","00:14:06,543","- Now he just does dog-food commercials.
- Hm."
241,"00:14:06,626","00:14:09,335","Mrs Bird doesn't like him
because he can never remember her name."
242,"00:14:09,418","00:14:12,001","Now then, simmer down, simmer...
All right, little bit more."
243,"00:14:13,376","00:14:16,293","That's enough!
I'm sorry, I'm at my worst tonight."
244,"00:14:16,376","00:14:18,501",I really am. I am...
245,"00:14:18,668","00:14:22,460",tickled the deepest shade of shrimp
246,"00:14:22,543","00:14:25,876","to have been asked here tonight
to open this wonderful old steam fair."
247,"00:14:25,960","00:14:30,418","But you know, when Madame Kozlova
created this thing all those years ago,"
248,"00:14:30,501","00:14:34,960","she most certainly was not thinking
of people like me, whatever I am."
249,"00:14:35,043","00:14:39,085","VIP, celebrity. I hate all that stuff.
No, no..."
250,"00:14:39,168","00:14:41,585","West End legend, that's another one."
251,"00:14:41,668","00:14:46,460","No, no, she was thinking of you guys,
huh? The ordinary people."
252,"00:14:46,543","00:14:51,043","So, I'm going to ask one of you
to come up here and open the fair."
253,"00:14:51,126","00:14:52,710",Volunteers? Anyone.
254,"00:14:52,793","00:14:53,876",Ooh!
255,"00:14:53,960","00:14:57,251","Eeny, meeny, miney..."
256,"00:14:57,918","00:14:58,918",...bear!
257,"00:14:59,001","00:15:01,835",Let's have the young bear. Why not?
258,"00:15:01,918","00:15:04,876","- Come, come, young ursine.
- Thank you."
259,"00:15:04,960","00:15:07,210","Up here, my furry friend.
Very good, very good."
260,"00:15:07,293","00:15:10,001","- Now, your name is?
- Paddington Brown."
261,"00:15:10,085","00:15:12,793","Oh, well, of course it is.
You are my new neighbour."
262,"00:15:12,876","00:15:14,501",You live with...
263,"00:15:14,585","00:15:19,085","Henry and Mary
and the great Mrs..."
264,"00:15:19,168","00:15:21,710","Now then, I suppose you know who I am."
265,"00:15:21,793","00:15:23,918","Oh, yes. You're a very famous actor."
266,"00:15:24,001","00:15:27,168","- Oh, pooh.
- Or used to be."
267,"00:15:27,251","00:15:30,043",Now you do dog-food commercials.
268,"00:15:30,126","00:15:33,335","- Well, a man has to eat.
- What, dog food?"
269,"00:15:38,876","00:15:40,168","Oh, very, very funny."
270,"00:15:40,251","00:15:42,710","Anyway, they do say"
271,"00:15:42,793","00:15:45,501","that at Madame Kozlova's,
all your dreams come true."
272,"00:15:45,585","00:15:47,960","So, if you had one wish tonight,
what would it be?"
273,"00:15:48,043","00:15:51,585","Oh, that's easy. I'd like to get
my Aunt Lucy a birthday present."
274,"00:15:51,710","00:15:53,626","- Aww.
- Darling."
275,"00:15:53,710","00:15:55,960","I've got my eye
on an old pop-up book of London."
276,"00:15:56,043","00:15:58,293","Made by Madame Kozlova, as it happens."
277,"00:15:58,376","00:16:00,460","The only problem is
it's rather expensive."
278,"00:16:00,543","00:16:03,418","So I need to get my paws
on an awful lot of money."
279,"00:16:03,501","00:16:05,668","Well, I'm not sure
that we can offer you that."
280,"00:16:05,751","00:16:07,793",But we can of course offer you
281,"00:16:07,876","00:16:11,668","o-o-o-odles of fun.
So, if you would like to lend me a paw,"
282,"00:16:11,751","00:16:15,126",we now declare Kozlova's Steam Fair...
283,"00:16:15,210","00:16:16,210",...open!
284,"00:16:17,585","00:16:19,668","Thank you, thank you very much."
285,"00:16:20,376","00:16:22,543",Wonderful! Thank you. Ooh!
286,"00:16:22,626","00:16:25,418","Ooh, wonderful."
287,"00:16:25,501","00:16:26,668",Mrs Brown?
288,"00:16:26,751","00:16:28,626","Just one moment.
A word in your ear."
289,"00:16:28,710","00:16:31,626","- Hm?
- This, er, this pop-up book."
290,"00:16:31,710","00:16:33,668","- Do you know it?
- I know of it."
291,"00:16:33,751","00:16:37,335","But I was led to believe it was lost.
Where on earth did you find it?"
292,"00:16:37,418","00:16:39,210","Oh, at Mr Gruber's antique shop."
293,"00:16:39,293","00:16:43,043","He's keeping it to one side for me
but I really need a job."
294,"00:16:43,126","00:16:46,418","I don't suppose you have any advice,
do you?"
295,"00:16:46,501","00:16:48,668",No. No. No.
296,"00:16:48,751","00:16:51,751","I imagine you just have to
start at the bottom of the ladder"
297,"00:16:51,876","00:16:55,126","- and work your way up.
- Do you know what, Mr Buchanan?"
298,"00:16:55,251","00:16:56,293",Hm?
299,"00:16:56,418","00:16:58,626","You've just given me
the most brilliant idea."
300,"00:16:58,710","00:17:02,043","- Have I?
- I'm going to be a window cleaner."
301,"00:17:23,001","00:17:24,585",Hmm.
302,"00:17:25,001","00:17:26,001",Ah!
303,"00:17:38,876","00:17:39,876",Oh!
304,"00:17:44,001","00:17:45,001",Hmm.
305,"00:17:45,835","00:17:46,835",Ah!
306,"00:17:55,335","00:17:56,335",Ah.
307,"00:17:56,960","00:17:58,876",Hm. Huh?
308,"00:17:59,835","00:18:01,126","Oh, dear."
309,"00:18:02,043","00:18:04,501",Oh. Um...
310,"00:18:14,251","00:18:15,376",Hmm...
311,"00:18:16,335","00:18:19,043",Ow.
312,"00:18:21,960","00:18:23,960",Hello? Anyone?
313,"00:18:37,335","00:18:39,335",Wha...
314,"00:18:46,335","00:18:47,335",Hm?
315,"00:18:54,543","00:18:56,918",Hello? Window cleaner.
316,"00:18:57,001","00:18:58,376","No, thank you."
317,"00:18:58,960","00:19:01,335","Are you sure, Colonel?
They're awfully dirty."
318,"00:19:01,418","00:19:03,710",I don't care and I'm not paying.
319,"00:19:04,543","00:19:06,126",Perhaps I'll do them anyway.
320,"00:19:26,085","00:19:27,168",Whoo!
321,"00:19:53,376","00:19:55,460","Good afternoon, Colonel. Are you aware"
322,"00:19:55,543","00:19:58,085","- there's a bear on your roof?
- Yes."
323,"00:19:58,210","00:19:59,710",He seems to be cleaning my windows.
324,"00:19:59,793","00:20:02,168","Shall I do
your gutters while I'm up here?"
325,"00:20:02,293","00:20:04,126","Er, yes. Thank you!"
326,"00:20:05,418","00:20:08,001","Well, of... of course,
it's not for me to say, Colonel,"
327,"00:20:08,085","00:20:10,251","but I wouldn't care
to have an undesirable"
328,"00:20:10,335","00:20:12,210",crawling all over my premises.
329,"00:20:12,293","00:20:14,626","And as commander
of your Community Defence Force..."
330,"00:20:14,710","00:20:17,001","Is that an official position, Mr Curry?"
331,"00:20:17,126","00:20:19,710","Or have you just bought yourself
a yellow coat?"
332,"00:20:22,001","00:20:23,668","Got my eye on you, bear!"
333,"00:20:24,668","00:20:26,585",Ooh! Sorry.

374,"00:23:05,668","00:23:07,543","Come on, boy. Hup!"
375,"00:23:09,043","00:23:11,501",Hup! Hup!
376,"00:23:11,585","00:23:14,126","- Ow! Ooh!
- Eh?"
377,"00:23:14,210","00:23:16,001",Excuse me. Coming through.
378,"00:23:16,085","00:23:17,543",Who are you? Ooh!
379,"00:23:19,668","00:23:21,210","Ooh, dear!"
380,"00:23:21,293","00:23:23,335",Strike a light!
381,"00:23:24,460","00:23:25,460",Ah.
382,"00:23:25,585","00:23:28,626",That book is reserved for Aunt Lucy!
383,"00:23:29,376","00:23:31,335",Hello there.
384,"00:23:31,501","00:23:33,793",Ooh. Ow. Not the snout.
385,"00:23:33,918","00:23:35,418",Wolfie!
386,"00:23:35,543","00:23:38,460",He-e-e-elp!
387,"00:23:39,043","00:23:42,085","Oh, thank you, Wolfie.
Now, come on."
388,"00:23:42,168","00:23:43,626",Attaboy.
389,"00:23:47,335","00:23:49,210","All right, all right."
390,"00:23:49,293","00:23:51,918","- You got me.
- Hand over that book."
391,"00:23:52,001","00:23:54,168",'Fraid I can't do that. Cheerio.
392,"00:23:56,126","00:23:58,668",But...
393,"00:23:58,793","00:24:01,293",Where did he go?
394,"00:24:01,918","00:24:04,001","- Hold it right there.
- Oh."
395,"00:24:04,085","00:24:07,501","- Thank goodness you're here, Officer.
- Put your... paws in the air."
396,"00:24:07,626","00:24:09,918",But... But I'm not the thief.
397,"00:24:10,001","00:24:13,210","I was chasing the thief.
And then he... he..."
398,"00:24:13,293","00:24:15,126",Disappeared in a puff of smoke?
399,"00:24:15,668","00:24:17,626","Well, yes."
400,"00:24:35,835","00:24:37,085","- Paddington!
- Oh, no!"
401,"00:24:37,168","00:24:39,376","- What's going on?
- Hold it there. Hang on."
402,"00:24:39,460","00:24:42,043","- We're taking him into custody.
- There must be some mistake."
403,"00:24:42,126","00:24:43,710","- No mistake, sir.
- What's happened?"
404,"00:24:43,793","00:24:45,376","- Caught red-handed.
- What?"
405,"00:24:45,460","00:24:49,418","- Robbing Gruber's Antiques.
- Well, well, well."
406,"00:24:49,501","00:24:51,251",The truth is out.
407,"00:24:51,335","00:24:53,460",We opened our hearts to that bear.
408,"00:24:54,085","00:24:55,710",We opened our doors.
409,"00:24:56,293","00:25:00,251","Well, you did. I kept mine triple locked
in accordance with the guidelines."
410,"00:25:00,376","00:25:04,293","And all along...
he was robbing you blind."
411,"00:25:04,418","00:25:06,835",Paddington!
412,"00:25:06,918","00:25:09,001","Oh, no!"
413,"00:25:09,126","00:25:12,126","- Paddington!
- Oh, dear!"
414,"00:25:16,876","00:25:19,918","A nice little haul, and no mistake."
415,"00:25:20,001","00:25:22,043","Turned out to be quite a stroke of luck,"
416,"00:25:22,168","00:25:24,543",that bear turning up when he did.
417,"00:25:24,626","00:25:28,460","Coppers think he done it.
We're in the clear."
418,"00:25:31,043","00:25:33,293","Indeed, Magwitch."
419,"00:25:33,376","00:25:36,501","And we gave quite a performance,
you and I."
420,"00:25:36,585","00:25:40,085","Just like the old days, hm?"
421,"00:25:40,835","00:25:42,668","Why the lemon face, Hamlet?"
422,"00:25:42,793","00:25:46,376","If you have something to say,
I beg you share it with us all."
423,"00:25:46,460","00:25:50,501","""It is not nor it cannot come to good.""
Oh, really."
424,"00:25:50,585","00:25:52,960","You and your dreary conscience.
Tell me this."
425,"00:25:53,043","00:25:55,876","Which would you rather?
That you stand here gathering dust"
426,"00:25:55,960","00:26:00,460","while I humiliate myself
in a spaniel's costume on television,"
427,"00:26:00,543","00:26:02,918",or that we all return in glory
428,"00:26:03,001","00:26:06,793","in the greatest one-man show
the West End has ever seen?"
429,"00:26:06,876","00:26:08,668",Bravo!
430,"00:26:08,793","00:26:12,460","Oh, thank you, my darlings.
Thank you. Thank you!"
431,"00:26:12,543","00:26:14,585",Blessings upon you all.
432,"00:26:14,668","00:26:17,585",Deepest of bows. Thank you.
433,"00:26:17,710","00:26:20,376","I know what you're thinking, Scrooge.
It'll cost a fortune."
434,"00:26:20,460","00:26:25,335","But if I'm right, that is exactly
what this book will provide."
435,"00:26:25,418","00:26:28,293",This is no dusty antique.
436,"00:26:28,376","00:26:33,085","Hidden on every page,
a little lady pointing to a clue."
437,"00:26:33,210","00:26:37,793",Find all the clues... we're rich again.
438,"00:26:38,501","00:26:41,501",And our dog-food days are done.
439,"00:26:42,960","00:26:44,918","Dinner is served, master."
440,"00:26:45,001","00:26:46,585","Thank you, Simkins."
441,"00:26:46,668","00:26:50,960","If, like me, your doggie
likes to maintain standards,"
442,"00:26:51,043","00:26:53,960","can I recommend
Harley's Gourmet Dindins?"
443,"00:26:54,043","00:26:57,126","More taste, more goodness, more..."
444,"00:26:57,585","00:27:00,460",dare one say... class?
445,"00:27:01,043","00:27:03,126","- Mmm.
- Harley's Gourmet Dog Food."
446,"00:27:03,210","00:27:05,918",Not to be consumed by humans.
447,"00:27:07,001","00:27:09,126",Court will rise.
448,"00:27:09,210","00:27:12,335","Deep breath, Paddington.
Remember what Mr Brown said."
449,"00:27:12,418","00:27:16,001","""You're young. You've done
nothing wrong. You'll be fine."""
450,"00:27:16,085","00:27:18,501","""So long as you get
a fair-minded judge."""
451,"00:27:18,626","00:27:21,126",Order! Order...
452,"00:27:25,251","00:27:27,543","- Oh, dear.
- You'll now hear the case"
453,"00:27:27,668","00:27:31,751","of the Crown
versus Paddington, er... Brown."
454,"00:27:32,960","00:27:37,460","Oh, yes, he loved the book.
His heart was set on top of it."
455,"00:27:37,543","00:27:41,001",So you discussed how expensive it was?
456,"00:27:41,085","00:27:43,876","Yes, but he was earning the money."
457,"00:27:43,960","00:27:48,585","I refuse to believe that young Mr Brown
would ever burglarise my shop."
458,"00:27:48,710","00:27:50,376",Exactly.
459,"00:27:50,501","00:27:52,001",Paw prints
460,"00:27:52,126","00:27:55,876","were found here, here and here."
461,"00:27:55,960","00:27:58,585","And a substance
later identified as marmalade"
462,"00:27:59,418","00:28:00,960",was found here.
463,"00:28:01,043","00:28:04,126",And is this the same marmalade?
464,"00:28:10,418","00:28:12,543","- Yes, it is.
- Oh, no."
465,"00:28:12,668","00:28:15,001","Phoenix Buchanan,
do you swear to tell the truth,"
466,"00:28:15,085","00:28:17,085","the whole truth
and nothing but the truth?"
467,"00:28:17,210","00:28:19,710",May my entrails be plucked forth
468,"00:28:19,793","00:28:24,251","and wound about my neck
should I deceive. I do."
469,"00:28:24,376","00:28:26,668",Prison is no laughing matter.
470,"00:28:26,751","00:28:29,668","And I should know,
I spent three years in Les Misérables."
471,"00:28:32,126","00:28:36,293","Mr Buchanan. You live on the same street
as the defendant."
472,"00:28:36,376","00:28:38,793","- I do.
- And you were an eye witness"
473,"00:28:38,876","00:28:42,293","- to the events that night.
- Indeed I was."
474,"00:28:42,418","00:28:46,585","I was up late, when I became aware
of a hullabaloo in the street below."
475,"00:28:46,710","00:28:50,668","I went to my awards room
which is a... large room"
476,"00:28:50,751","00:28:52,501",overlooking the newspaper kiosk.
477,"00:28:52,626","00:28:58,210","And I saw young Paddington riding
a rather disreputable-looking hound."
478,"00:28:58,293","00:29:00,210",Mary Brown drew this
479,"00:29:00,293","00:29:04,126","based on the bear's description
of the man he claims he was chasing."
480,"00:29:04,251","00:29:06,210","- Hm.
- Did you see him"
481,"00:29:06,335","00:29:10,376","- on the street that night?
- Oh, a handsome devil, isn't he? Hmm?"
482,"00:29:10,501","00:29:14,001","- Dazzling eyes.
- Yes, but did you see him?"
483,"00:29:14,085","00:29:17,918","Your answer will tell us
whether the bear is guilty."
484,"00:29:18,001","00:29:20,376",Did you see this man?
485,"00:29:20,460","00:29:21,543",Alas...
486,"00:29:22,876","00:29:24,918",I did not.
487,"00:29:25,001","00:29:28,001",But perhaps he'd already vanished.
488,"00:29:28,085","00:29:31,126","I beg you, have mercy on him.
He is but a cub!"
489,"00:29:32,460","00:29:34,793",Paddington Brown.
490,"00:29:35,543","00:29:38,793",Ten years for grand theft...
491,"00:29:38,918","00:29:40,168","Oh, but..."
492,"00:29:40,293","00:29:44,001","...and grievous ""barberly"" harm."
493,"00:29:47,293","00:29:48,751",Follow me.
494,"00:30:12,168","00:30:15,335","Oh, um..."
495,"00:30:15,418","00:30:18,960","Mrs Brown usually reads me
a story before bed. I don't suppose...?"
496,"00:30:19,043","00:30:22,043","Sorry, son. No bedtime stories in here."
497,"00:30:22,668","00:30:23,668",Oh.
498,"00:30:42,168","00:30:47,126","Dear Aunt Lucy, a great deal
has happened since I last wrote."
499,"00:30:47,960","00:30:50,835","There's been a bit of a mix-up
with your present"
500,"00:30:50,918","00:30:54,376","and the upshot is I've had to leave
Windsor Gardens and move..."
501,"00:30:55,210","00:30:57,126",somewhere else.
502,"00:30:57,918","00:31:00,793","It isn't quite as charming
as the Browns' house,"
503,"00:31:00,876","00:31:02,460",but it's not all bad.
504,"00:31:02,585","00:31:05,043","It's a period property. In fact,"
505,"00:31:05,126","00:31:08,918","it's one of the most substantial
Victorian buildings in London."
506,"00:31:09,001","00:31:12,210","And the security arrangements
are second to none."
507,"00:31:13,043","00:31:15,626","I'm only allowed to see the Browns
once a month."
508,"00:31:17,126","00:31:19,043",I wonder what they're doing now.
509,"00:31:44,418","00:31:46,668",I do hope they don't forget me.
510,"00:31:48,335","00:31:52,335","Of course they won't, Paddington.
This is the Browns you're talking about."
511,"00:31:52,418","00:31:53,918","They'll sort everything out,"
512,"00:31:54,001","00:31:56,918","and I'll be able to go home
and get your present,"
513,"00:31:57,001","00:32:00,210",and everything will be right as rain.
514,"00:32:01,001","00:32:03,418",I just need to hold on till then.
515,"00:32:43,543","00:32:44,543",D.
516,"00:32:50,251","00:32:52,043",The hunt begins.
517,"00:32:57,210","00:32:58,710",Three-two-five.
518,"00:32:58,793","00:33:00,626",Three-two-six.
519,"00:33:00,710","00:33:02,668",Three-two-seven.
520,"00:33:02,751","00:33:05,043","Here goes, Paddington. Manners."
521,"00:33:05,126","00:33:06,126",Fall in.
522,"00:33:07,168","00:33:10,085","Good morning. How would you like
to start a gardening club?"
523,"00:33:10,168","00:33:13,918","How would you like to be buried
in a very deep hole?"
524,"00:33:14,626","00:33:15,626",After you.
525,"00:33:15,710","00:33:18,085","Spooner, R. Workshop."
526,"00:33:19,543","00:33:22,085","Brown, P. Laundry duty."
527,"00:33:22,751","00:33:24,835","Right, laundry."
528,"00:33:24,918","00:33:27,085","Laundry, laundry... Ah!"
529,"00:33:27,168","00:33:28,335",Laundry!
530,"00:33:31,501","00:33:33,293",Hmm...
531,"00:33:33,876","00:33:35,001",Oh!
532,"00:33:45,876","00:33:47,126",Ugh!
533,"00:33:52,335","00:33:53,335",Oh!
534,"00:34:00,668","00:34:01,668",Hmm!
535,"00:34:16,876","00:34:18,668","Oh, it's only one red sock."
536,"00:34:19,210","00:34:21,043",What's the worst that can happen?
537,"00:34:24,960","00:34:27,626","Afternoon, chaps."
538,"00:34:27,710","00:34:31,626","If you ask me, the... the pink
really brightens the place up a bit."
539,"00:34:31,710","00:34:35,710","If you ask me, you should pipe down
and enjoy your dinner,"
540,"00:34:35,793","00:34:37,793",cos it might be your last.
541,"00:34:38,585","00:34:40,043",OK.
542,"00:34:56,085","00:34:57,835",Ugh!
543,"00:34:57,918","00:35:00,626","Ah, don't worry.
I used to be a restaurant critic."
544,"00:35:00,710","00:35:04,626","- It's not as bad as it looks.
- Oh."
545,"00:35:04,710","00:35:06,501",It's worse.
546,"00:35:06,585","00:35:09,626","- What is this?
- Nobody knows."
547,"00:35:09,710","00:35:13,376","But we've been eating it
three times a day for the past ten year."
548,"00:35:13,460","00:35:15,418","Why doesn't someone have a word
with the chef?"
549,"00:35:17,126","00:35:20,460",With Knuckles?
550,"00:35:20,543","00:35:23,335","Two things to remember
if you want to survive in here."
551,"00:35:23,418","00:35:25,210",Keep your head down.
552,"00:35:25,335","00:35:27,251",And never talk to Knuckles.
553,"00:35:27,335","00:35:30,293","- Thank you.
- Well, I think it's a great idea."
554,"00:35:30,418","00:35:33,668","Tell you what, son,
you get Knuckles to change the menu"
555,"00:35:33,751","00:35:38,376","and we might forget about you making us
look like a bunch of pink flamingos."
556,"00:35:38,960","00:35:41,710","- All right then. I will.
- Oh, you don't wanna do that."
557,"00:35:41,793","00:35:45,210","Aunt Lucy said, ""If you look for
the good in people, you'll find it."""
558,"00:35:45,293","00:35:48,210",She obviously never met Knuckles.
559,"00:35:53,710","00:35:57,460","Um, excuse me. Mr Knuckles?"
560,"00:35:58,835","00:36:00,376",Yes?
561,"00:36:00,460","00:36:03,168","I just wondered if I could have
a quick word about the food."
562,"00:36:03,251","00:36:05,668",Send a medic to the canteen.
563,"00:36:05,751","00:36:07,168",You want to...
564,"00:36:08,668","00:36:10,043",complain?
565,"00:36:10,126","00:36:13,376","- Oh, no, I... I wouldn't say complain.
- Oh, that's a shame."
566,"00:36:13,460","00:36:17,376","Because I just love it
when people complain."
567,"00:36:18,376","00:36:20,543","- Really?
- Oh, yeah."
568,"00:36:20,626","00:36:24,168","Oh. Well, in that case,
it's very gritty."
569,"00:36:24,251","00:36:26,210","- Oh?
- And lumpy."
570,"00:36:26,293","00:36:28,460",And as for the bread...
571,"00:36:28,543","00:36:30,251",Need I say more?
572,"00:36:30,335","00:36:33,210","I think we need to completely
overhaul the menu. Now..."
573,"00:36:33,293","00:36:36,918","I know we're working to a tight budget,
but we could at least add some sauce."
574,"00:36:37,001","00:36:40,335","Oh, sorry about that. I'll just, er..."
575,"00:36:40,918","00:36:44,001","Hmm. No, that's just rubbing it in."
576,"00:36:45,126","00:36:47,960","Don't worry.
I know what gets ketchup stains out."
577,"00:36:50,043","00:36:51,918",Hang on. Was it mustard?
578,"00:36:53,126","00:36:54,668",Hmm... no.
579,"00:36:55,710","00:36:57,168",That's just made it worse!
580,"00:36:57,251","00:36:59,710",Does anyone know what works on ketchup?
581,"00:37:00,251","00:37:01,335",Chaps?
582,"00:37:05,543","00:37:07,918",Forget the medic. Better send a priest.
583,"00:37:08,001","00:37:10,793","- You listen to me, you little maggot.
- Listening."
584,"00:37:10,876","00:37:14,043","- Nobody criticises my food.
- Right."
585,"00:37:14,126","00:37:17,626",Nobody squirts condiments on my apron.
586,"00:37:17,710","00:37:19,251","- Got it.
- And nobody"
587,"00:37:19,335","00:37:22,126","bonks me on the head
with a baguette."
588,"00:37:22,210","00:37:24,585","- No bonking.
- I'll overhaul the menu all right."
589,"00:37:24,668","00:37:26,085","- Really?
- Dish of the day."
590,"00:37:26,168","00:37:27,668","- Yes?
- Bear pie!"
591,"00:37:27,751","00:37:29,793",I don't like it!
592,"00:37:46,710","00:37:50,460","- What is this?
- It's a marmalade sandwich."
593,"00:37:51,460","00:37:52,710",Marmalade?
594,"00:37:52,793","00:37:55,335",My Aunt Lucy taught me to make them.
595,"00:37:55,418","00:37:57,293","You mean, you can make this?"
596,"00:37:57,376","00:38:00,418","- Well, yes.
- Stand aside."
597,"00:38:01,668","00:38:06,168","Get up off the floor,
you bunch of yellow-bellies!"
598,"00:38:06,293","00:38:10,585","Listen to me.
This bear is now under my protection."
599,"00:38:10,668","00:38:14,043","- Oh?
- Anyone who touches a hair on his back"
600,"00:38:14,126","00:38:17,001",will answer to Knuckles McGinty.
601,"00:38:17,626","00:38:20,710",That's Knuckles with a capital N.
602,"00:38:22,918","00:38:25,918","- Thank you, Mr McGinty.
- Don't thank me yet."
603,"00:38:26,543","00:38:29,293","I don't do nothin' for no one
for nothin'."
604,"00:38:29,876","00:38:30,876",Beg your pardon?
605,"00:38:31,918","00:38:37,918","You get my protection, so long as
you make that marmalade. Deal?"
606,"00:38:38,918","00:38:41,085",Deal.
607,"00:38:48,376","00:38:51,335","Somebody's got to recognise him
sooner or later."
608,"00:38:51,418","00:38:53,085",Hmm.
609,"00:38:53,168","00:38:54,710","You all right, Mr Gruber?"
610,"00:38:55,126","00:38:57,293","There's something
about this whole business"
611,"00:38:57,376","00:39:00,251","- that has been tickling my brainbox.
- What is it?"
612,"00:39:00,335","00:39:03,960","On the night of the robbery,
when young Mr Brown called out,"
613,"00:39:04,043","00:39:07,126","the thief took to his heels
and ran down the stairs."
614,"00:39:07,251","00:39:10,001","Came straight through the shop
and out the front door,"
615,"00:39:10,085","00:39:12,001",setting off the alarm.
616,"00:39:12,085","00:39:15,543","Ah, but that's the thing.
He didn't go straight through the shop."
617,"00:39:15,626","00:39:17,335","- No?
- He came all the way over here"
618,"00:39:17,418","00:39:19,460",to get the popping book.
619,"00:39:19,543","00:39:22,043",Why not some jewellery or a vase?
620,"00:39:22,126","00:39:24,210",They're much closer. Far more valuable.
621,"00:39:24,293","00:39:26,501",He can't know much about antiques.
622,"00:39:26,585","00:39:29,710",No. Unless...
623,"00:39:30,293","00:39:33,043","he knows something about that book
that we don't."
624,"00:39:35,876","00:39:38,418","You may find this hard
to believe, Madame Kozlova,"
625,"00:39:38,501","00:39:40,168",but Paddington is innocent.
626,"00:39:40,251","00:39:43,210","And we think that the real thief
may have broken into Mr Gruber's"
627,"00:39:43,335","00:39:46,043","just to steal
your great-grandmother's pop-up book."
628,"00:39:46,126","00:39:48,793","- The pop-up book?
- I know it sounds far-fetched."
629,"00:39:48,876","00:39:51,501","But is there anything
you could tell us about that book?"
630,"00:39:51,585","00:39:53,501",Anything at all could be helpful.
631,"00:39:54,876","00:39:57,835","- That's quite a story.
- Oh, really?"
632,"00:39:59,126","00:40:00,251",Come with me.
633,"00:40:01,085","00:40:03,543",I'll show you where it all happened.
634,"00:40:04,043","00:40:08,210","You see, my great-grandmother,
who started this fair,"
635,"00:40:08,335","00:40:11,585","was the finest show woman
of her generation."
636,"00:40:11,668","00:40:15,501","She could tame lions,
breathe fire, swallow swords."
637,"00:40:15,585","00:40:19,168","But she was most famous...
for the trapeze."
638,"00:40:20,668","00:40:23,876","- They called her the Flying Swan.
- Bravo!"
639,"00:40:23,960","00:40:27,293","Wherever she went,
she was showered with gifts,"
640,"00:40:27,376","00:40:29,585",and made a fortune.
641,"00:40:29,668","00:40:34,376","But where there is a fortune,
there is also jealousy."
642,"00:40:34,460","00:40:37,293",The magician wanted it for himself.
643,"00:40:38,251","00:40:40,835",And the Flying Swan...
644,"00:40:42,585","00:40:45,460",...became the Dying Swan.
645,"00:40:46,710","00:40:51,543","He went to her caravan
and opened her strongbox."
646,"00:40:51,626","00:40:53,710","But instead of her treasure,"
647,"00:40:53,793","00:40:57,918","all he found was one
of her pop-up books."
648,"00:40:58,001","00:41:01,043","""Twelve Landmarks of London."""
649,"00:41:01,168","00:41:05,751","They had him cornered,
but he vanished."
650,"00:41:05,835","00:41:10,918","And neither he nor the treasure
were ever heard of again."
651,"00:41:12,001","00:41:14,460","I knew there was something special
about that pop-up book."
652,"00:41:14,543","00:41:15,543",Hmm?
653,"00:41:15,626","00:41:17,876","Why else would she have kept it
in her strongbox?"
654,"00:41:17,960","00:41:20,376","You're not telling me
you believed all that guff, are you?"
655,"00:41:20,460","00:41:23,335","Madame Kozlova drew
12 London landmarks in that book."
656,"00:41:23,418","00:41:24,460",Yes?
657,"00:41:24,543","00:41:27,918","Well, what if they're not
just landmarks? What if they're..."
658,"00:41:28,001","00:41:31,460","- I don't know, clues?
- Clues?"
659,"00:41:31,543","00:41:34,251","- To where she hid her fortune.
- You mean a treasure map?"
660,"00:41:34,335","00:41:35,751","- Exactly!
- Oh..."
661,"00:41:35,835","00:41:38,001","And that's why the thief
took it from Mr Gruber's."
662,"00:41:38,126","00:41:41,293","First thing tomorrow, we need to go
to every landmark in that book."
663,"00:41:41,376","00:41:43,835","See if we can sniff out
anything suspicious."
664,"00:41:43,918","00:41:46,668","- Too many adventure stories, Mary.
- What?"
665,"00:41:46,751","00:41:48,210",She's a fortune teller.
666,"00:41:48,293","00:41:50,210",She spun you a yarn. It's what they do.
667,"00:41:50,293","00:41:52,876","Honestly, Henry,
you're so closed-minded these days."
668,"00:41:52,960","00:41:56,460","- What's that supposed to mean?
- What happened to the man I married?"
669,"00:41:56,543","00:41:58,918","- He'd have believed me.
- Oh, him."
670,"00:41:59,001","00:42:00,710","- He's gone.
- What?"
671,"00:42:00,793","00:42:03,335","I'm afraid your husband's
just a creaky old man."
672,"00:42:03,418","00:42:05,835","- He's not Bullseye Brown.
- Oh, Lord."
673,"00:42:05,918","00:42:08,460",♪ I'm crazy like a fool
674,"00:42:09,751","00:42:12,001","♪ What about it, Daddy Cool?"
675,"00:42:13,293","00:42:16,043","♪ Daddy, Daddy Cool"
676,"00:42:17,168","00:42:19,626","♪ Daddy, Daddy Cool"
677,"00:42:19,710","00:42:20,793",Bullseye.
678,"00:42:20,876","00:42:22,501","Oh, Henry."
679,"00:42:22,585","00:42:24,335",♪ She's crazy about her Daddy
680,"00:42:24,418","00:42:26,460",Henry? Henry!
681,"00:42:26,543","00:42:29,001","Anyway, the point is,
we're not going to help Paddington"
682,"00:42:29,085","00:42:30,710",by going on a wild-goose chase.
683,"00:42:30,793","00:42:34,168","We're looking for this scruffy chancer,
not some swashbuckling pirate"
684,"00:42:34,251","00:42:35,918",hunting for buried treasure.
685,"00:42:36,793","00:42:40,043","I think there's more to him
than meets the eye."
686,"00:42:40,168","00:42:43,751","I think he somehow knew the story
of the Koslova fortune"
687,"00:42:43,835","00:42:46,460","and is out there right now
trying to find it."
688,"00:42:47,585","00:42:49,210","Well, Grandfather,"
689,"00:42:49,793","00:42:53,460","tonight we go in search
of clue number two."
690,"00:42:54,460","00:42:55,876","The setting,"
691,"00:42:55,960","00:42:57,876",St Paul's Cathedral.
692,"00:42:58,626","00:43:01,001",But how to slip in unobserved.
693,"00:43:01,793","00:43:04,585",Enter Sister Isabella.
694,"00:43:15,001","00:43:17,668",Wakey-wakey.
695,"00:43:17,751","00:43:19,918",Marmalade time.
696,"00:43:21,710","00:43:24,918","There you go, lads. Good luck."
697,"00:43:25,001","00:43:27,835","- Um, Mr McGinty?
- What do you want?"
698,"00:43:27,918","00:43:30,335","Well, the thing is,
I'm actually innocent."
699,"00:43:30,418","00:43:32,751",And I wondered if you had any advice
700,"00:43:32,835","00:43:34,960","on how to clear my name,
now that we're friends."
701,"00:43:35,043","00:43:37,918","Friends?
I'm your boss, not your buddy."
702,"00:43:38,001","00:43:40,876","Oh. Well, after you."
703,"00:43:40,960","00:43:43,668",Why? So you can stab me in the back?
704,"00:43:43,751","00:43:46,585",No. Because it's polite.
705,"00:43:46,668","00:43:49,793","Aunt Lucy said, ""If we're kind
and polite, the world will be right."""
706,"00:43:49,876","00:43:52,335","You were ahead of me
and now you're behind."
707,"00:43:52,418","00:43:54,168",That makes you a sap.
708,"00:43:54,251","00:43:56,793",Ingredients are over there.
709,"00:43:56,876","00:43:59,293","Um, aren't you going to help?"
710,"00:43:59,376","00:44:01,710",Nope. Now get on with it.
711,"00:44:01,793","00:44:04,293","But there's 500 hungry prisoners
coming for breakfast."
712,"00:44:04,376","00:44:06,335",So we'll need a thousand juicy oranges.
713,"00:44:06,418","00:44:09,626","Oh, and rule number one: no talking."
714,"00:44:15,918","00:44:18,001","- Rule number two.
- Hmm?"
715,"00:44:18,626","00:44:19,668",No humming.
716,"00:44:19,751","00:44:20,918","- But...
- Or singing."
717,"00:44:21,001","00:44:24,918","- I...
- Or any other expression of bonhomie."
718,"00:44:39,001","00:44:41,210","Oh, dear."
719,"00:44:43,210","00:44:45,126","Ooh, that's heavy."
720,"00:44:47,168","00:44:49,835","Come on,
put your back into it."
721,"00:44:49,918","00:44:51,001",Oh!
722,"00:44:51,876","00:44:54,376",Help!
723,"00:44:55,668","00:44:57,210",These sacks are awfully heavy.
724,"00:44:57,293","00:44:59,668","- Well, take them one at a time, then.
- Right."
725,"00:44:59,751","00:45:00,793",One at a...
726,"00:45:00,876","00:45:01,876",...time.
727,"00:45:09,251","00:45:12,001",One juicy orange.
728,"00:45:15,626","00:45:17,251",Two juicy oranges.
729,"00:45:19,835","00:45:23,251",Three juicy oranges.
730,"00:45:24,418","00:45:26,168","- Four juicy...
- Now what are you doing?"
731,"00:45:26,251","00:45:27,876",Taking them one at a time.
732,"00:45:27,960","00:45:30,210",One sack at a time!
733,"00:45:30,293","00:45:33,335","I'm sorry. I'm finding this
a very stressful working environment."
734,"00:45:33,418","00:45:35,335","- Aunt Lucy said...
- Aunt Lucy!"
735,"00:45:35,418","00:45:38,001","- I've had it up to here with Aunt Lucy!
- Oh!"
736,"00:45:38,085","00:45:39,918",She sounds like a proper old bag to me.
737,"00:45:42,418","00:45:44,626",I beg your pardon?
738,"00:45:45,460","00:45:47,335",I said...
739,"00:45:47,418","00:45:51,543","your Aunt Lucy sounds like
one of the most naive,"
740,"00:45:51,626","00:45:54,918","gullible, mushy-brained..."
741,"00:45:56,210","00:45:57,251",What's going on?
742,"00:45:59,126","00:46:01,126",Why are you looking at me like that?
743,"00:46:02,960","00:46:06,960","It's awful hot in here.
Are you hot? I'm hot."
744,"00:46:07,043","00:46:08,376",Did I leave the oven on?
745,"00:46:08,460","00:46:11,251",It's called a hard stare.
746,"00:46:11,335","00:46:15,043","Aunt Lucy taught me to do them
when people had forgotten their manners."
747,"00:46:15,126","00:46:17,085","You don't have to tell me
about hard stares."
748,"00:46:17,168","00:46:18,668",I practically invented them.
749,"00:46:19,960","00:46:22,043","Pretty good for a bear though,
I'll give you that."
750,"00:46:22,126","00:46:23,460","Now, Mr McGinty,"
751,"00:46:23,543","00:46:27,126","I may look like a hardened criminal
to you, but I really am innocent."
752,"00:46:27,210","00:46:29,210","And if you're not going to help me
clear my name,"
753,"00:46:29,293","00:46:31,501","you could at least
help me make this marmalade."
754,"00:46:31,585","00:46:34,251","All right, I'll help."
755,"00:46:34,335","00:46:36,751","- Thank you.
- Not gonna be much use to you though."
756,"00:46:37,543","00:46:39,585",These weren't exactly made for cooking.
757,"00:46:39,668","00:46:41,251",I don't know.
758,"00:46:41,335","00:46:44,543","Looks to me like you've got yourself
a fine pair of orange squeezers."
759,"00:46:45,085","00:46:46,876",Orange squeezers?
760,"00:46:50,335","00:46:52,293",Good.
761,"00:46:52,376","00:46:54,043",No. Better.
762,"00:46:54,126","00:46:56,251",Tomato. Lovely.
763,"00:46:56,335","00:46:59,543",Yes. Spot on.
764,"00:46:59,626","00:47:01,835","Now, we have to be very careful
with knives."
765,"00:47:01,918","00:47:04,918",Aunt Lucy said that sensible bears...
766,"00:47:05,543","00:47:07,918","Where on earth did you learn
to use a knife like that?"
767,"00:47:08,001","00:47:10,501",You don't wanna know.
768,"00:47:10,585","00:47:12,168","Well, it's jolly good."
769,"00:47:13,626","00:47:15,793",Now?
770,"00:47:15,876","00:47:17,126",Now.
771,"00:47:19,043","00:47:21,376","- Right, it's time for the sugar.
- OK."
772,"00:47:21,460","00:47:23,710","That's what turns the juice
into marmalade."
773,"00:47:23,793","00:47:26,001","- How much?
- Ooh, a lot."
774,"00:47:26,751","00:47:29,293",Same again.
775,"00:47:30,460","00:47:31,460",Ah.
776,"00:47:32,085","00:47:35,710",A squeeze of lemon. A pinch of cinnamon.
777,"00:47:36,335","00:47:38,418",And just a bit more sugar.
778,"00:47:39,001","00:47:41,668","Well, is it good?"
779,"00:47:41,751","00:47:45,251","Ooh, it's too soon to tell.
We'll only really know once it's set."
780,"00:47:47,835","00:47:49,585","Designed by Sir Christopher Wren,"
781,"00:47:49,668","00:47:53,043","St Paul's Cathedral is one
of London's most famous landmarks."
782,"00:47:53,126","00:47:56,085","Sadly the Great Dome
is closed to visitors today"
783,"00:47:56,168","00:48:00,168","as one of its statues was destroyed
in a bizarre accident last night."
784,"00:48:00,251","00:48:03,251","- But if you follow me this way...
- Excuse me, what happened here?"
785,"00:48:03,335","00:48:06,210","- A nun went berserk.
- Really?"
786,"00:48:06,293","00:48:07,626",It happens.
787,"00:48:07,710","00:48:10,710","The police have rounded them all up
for questioning."
788,"00:48:10,793","00:48:12,251","Hold it there, Sister!"
789,"00:48:12,335","00:48:14,835","You're going nowhere
till the detective says so."
790,"00:48:14,918","00:48:16,710",Spin it around!
791,"00:48:18,668","00:48:23,876","Mind you, if you ask me,
the real culprit slipped the net."
792,"00:48:24,376","00:48:25,585",What makes you say that?
793,"00:48:25,668","00:48:28,376","Cos I saw her, that's what."
794,"00:48:28,460","00:48:33,168","I was on patrol in the Upper Dome,
watching the nuns parade far below,"
795,"00:48:33,251","00:48:35,918",when something caught my eye.
796,"00:48:36,001","00:48:37,876",One of them broke free from the herd.
797,"00:48:37,960","00:48:40,835","and made her way
to the Whispering Gallery."
798,"00:48:45,835","00:48:48,335","Only the good Lord knows
what she was doing up there."
799,"00:48:48,418","00:48:49,710",C.
800,"00:48:51,085","00:48:53,293","But she was never
gonna get away with it."
801,"00:48:53,376","00:48:55,710","Not while I'm vice deputy head
of security."
802,"00:48:55,793","00:48:57,251",Oi!
803,"00:49:04,293","00:49:06,668","Attention all units,
an unusually attractive nun"
804,"00:49:06,751","00:49:10,335","is causing mayhem in the cathedral dome.
Activate emergency protocol."
805,"00:49:10,418","00:49:12,418",Stop that stunning sister!
806,"00:49:12,501","00:49:15,668",I set off at lightning speed.
807,"00:49:16,126","00:49:20,460","But by the time we'd locked the place
down, she'd vanished into the night."
808,"00:49:20,543","00:49:23,460","- Good evening, my son.
- Oh, er, good evening, Your Grace."
809,"00:49:23,543","00:49:24,668",Good evening.
810,"00:49:25,460","00:49:28,501",Most beautiful woman I've seen
811,"00:49:28,585","00:49:31,501",in a lo-o-o-ong time.
812,"00:49:31,585","00:49:34,668","Do you think you might be able
to describe her?"
813,"00:49:34,751","00:49:37,210",It would be my pleasure.
814,"00:49:41,585","00:49:44,251","Gentlemen, for breakfast this morning,"
815,"00:49:44,335","00:49:47,168","Chef McGinty would like to propose
an orange marmalade..."
816,"00:49:47,251","00:49:48,543",...served on a bed
817,"00:49:48,626","00:49:50,835",of warm crustless bread
818,"00:49:50,960","00:49:55,418","topped with another piece
of warm... crustless bread."
819,"00:49:56,418","00:49:57,543",Bon appétit!
820,"00:50:00,001","00:50:02,835",Two choices: take it or leave it!
821,"00:50:05,626","00:50:08,126","Are you all right, Knuckles?"
822,"00:50:08,210","00:50:09,210",Yes!
823,"00:50:09,793","00:50:11,751",Why don't you come and join the others?
824,"00:50:11,835","00:50:12,835",Don't want to.
825,"00:50:14,210","00:50:16,376","- Are you scared what they might think?
- No!"
826,"00:50:16,460","00:50:19,001","What do they think? Did they like it?
Did they say anything?"
827,"00:50:19,085","00:50:20,460","- What did they say?
- Well..."
828,"00:50:20,543","00:50:22,501",They hated it! I knew it!
829,"00:50:22,585","00:50:25,876","My father always said
I'd amount to nothing and he was right!"
830,"00:50:25,960","00:50:28,168",Knuckles. Knuckles!
831,"00:50:28,251","00:50:30,876","- What?
- Come and look."
832,"00:50:51,793","00:50:52,793",Come on.
833,"00:51:11,126","00:51:12,793","- Paddington.
- Hm?"
834,"00:51:12,918","00:51:15,710","I've a strange, warm tingle
in my tum-tum."
835,"00:51:15,793","00:51:18,085","I think that's called pride, Knuckles."
836,"00:51:18,168","00:51:20,335","Well, I don't like it."
837,"00:51:23,335","00:51:26,460","Um, have...
have you got anything else?"
838,"00:51:27,626","00:51:30,293","- What?
- You know, for, um... pudding?"
839,"00:51:30,376","00:51:32,043","- No!
- Fair enough."
840,"00:51:32,126","00:51:34,126","I'm afraid we only know
how to make marmalade."
841,"00:51:34,210","00:51:36,293","- Hmm.
- But if you have any recipes..."
842,"00:51:36,376","00:51:38,835","This lot? You're wasting
your time there, Paddington."
843,"00:51:38,918","00:51:42,335","They wouldn't know
their pectin from their paprika."
844,"00:51:43,335","00:51:46,376","Well, my grandmother
used to do a lovely chocolate roulade."
845,"00:51:47,168","00:51:48,918",I think I can remember the recipe.
846,"00:51:49,001","00:51:50,126",Ooh.
847,"00:51:50,210","00:51:53,168","Charley Rumble
makes a mean apple crumble."
848,"00:51:56,168","00:51:58,876","And I can make
a strawberry panna cotta..."
849,"00:51:58,960","00:52:01,335",...with a pomegranate glaze.
850,"00:52:01,418","00:52:04,668","Oh, I like the sound of that.
Don't you, Knuckles?"
851,"00:52:04,751","00:52:06,918","- Yeah!
- Come on, then."
852,"00:52:07,001","00:52:08,751",Let's get cooking.

- We think the thief you saw"
889,"00:53:59,501","00:54:01,585","- is part of a criminal gang.
- Using the pop-up book"
890,"00:54:01,668","00:54:03,585","- as a treasure map.
- Well, it's a theory."
891,"00:54:03,668","00:54:06,168","- Have you found out who they are?
- Not yet, dearie."
892,"00:54:06,876","00:54:09,293",Maybe I should take a look.
893,"00:54:10,001","00:54:11,918","I'm sorry,
this is a private conversation."
894,"00:54:12,001","00:54:14,501","Oh, it's all right, Mr Brown,
this is my friend, Knuckles."
895,"00:54:14,585","00:54:15,835","- How are you?

- How do?"
902,"00:54:23,501","00:54:24,501","- Mad Dog.
- Woof!"

905,"00:54:28,376","00:54:30,918",And Charley Rumble.

907,"00:54:33,418","00:54:35,835","I must say, it's a great relief"
908,"00:54:35,918","00:54:39,460","to know that Paddington's already made
such sweet friends."
909,"00:54:39,543","00:54:41,126",Would you excuse us a moment?
910,"00:54:43,293","00:54:46,210","- What are you doing?
- Talking to the nice men."
911,"00:54:46,293","00:54:49,793","Nice men?
Mary, we can't trust these people."
912,"00:54:49,876","00:54:54,085","I mean, look at them.
Talk about a rogues' gallery. Hideous!"
913,"00:54:54,168","00:54:57,126","As for that bearded baboon in the
middle, he's hardly got two brain cells"
914,"00:54:57,210","00:55:00,210","- to rub together.
- We can still hear you, Mr Brown."
915,"00:55:02,960","00:55:04,460",That was the light you turned off.
916,"00:55:04,543","00:55:09,793","The microphone is on the other side.
It's got ""microphone"" written on it."
917,"00:55:13,376","00:55:16,210","Gentlemen,
if I have offended you in any way..."
918,"00:55:16,293","00:55:19,126","Don't worry about it.
We're fond of the little fella."
919,"00:55:19,210","00:55:23,126","And let's face it, if anyone
can recognise a criminal gang, it's us."
920,"00:55:23,210","00:55:25,793",We'd be grateful for any help.
921,"00:55:25,876","00:55:28,793","- Please.
- Well? Knuckles?"
922,"00:55:28,876","00:55:31,876","I'm afraid I don't recognise
any of them. Lads?"
923,"00:55:33,126","00:55:35,626",I'm afraid I couldn't possibly comment.
924,"00:55:35,710","00:55:37,126","Sorry to say it, kid,"
925,"00:55:37,210","00:55:39,501","but your friends
are barking up the wrong tree."
926,"00:55:39,585","00:55:42,210","A nun, a beefeater and a king?"
927,"00:55:42,293","00:55:45,960","Sounds more like a fancy dress party
than a criminal gang."
928,"00:55:46,043","00:55:47,085",Then...
929,"00:55:47,960","00:55:49,751",what are we going to do now?
930,"00:55:58,960","00:56:00,335",Oh!
931,"00:56:00,418","00:56:02,376","- Watch where you're going.
- So sorry. Sorry."
932,"00:56:02,460","00:56:05,085","Sorry, I get grumpy
when I haven't had breakfast."
933,"00:56:07,751","00:56:10,876",Keys... Keys. Keys!
934,"00:56:10,960","00:56:11,960",Bottoms!
935,"00:56:13,418","00:56:15,543","- Turn left...
- You can't park here!"
936,"00:56:15,668","00:56:18,043","I'm not parked, I'm doing the bins."
937,"00:56:18,126","00:56:20,418","You're not doing the bins, sunshine."
938,"00:56:20,501","00:56:23,376",You're studying on council time.
939,"00:56:23,460","00:56:26,418",I'm gonna report you. And your hat.
940,"00:56:26,501","00:56:29,251","- Morning, Miss Kitts, Colonel.
- Oh, morning, Mrs Brown."
941,"00:56:29,335","00:56:31,251",Judy asked me to drop these off to you.
942,"00:56:31,335","00:56:33,001",Propaganda!
943,"00:56:33,085","00:56:36,085","You are wasting your time
trying to peddle that rubbish."
944,"00:56:36,835","00:56:39,668","Everyone round here
knows it was your bear that done it."
945,"00:56:39,751","00:56:42,793","And this street
is a far, far better place without him."
946,"00:56:42,876","00:56:45,085",What?
947,"00:56:45,168","00:56:48,793","Oi, it's that mangy dog!
You are going to the pound, my son."
948,"00:56:48,876","00:56:50,710","Barking without a licence
in a built-up area."
949,"00:56:50,793","00:56:52,626","- Give 'em here.
- I'll ticket you!"
950,"00:56:52,710","00:56:55,085","I have to sell them under the counter
for obvious reasons,"
951,"00:56:55,168","00:56:56,501",but people are buying 'em.
952,"00:56:56,585","00:56:58,918","- Really?
- It's a bloomin' good read. Hm."
953,"00:56:59,001","00:57:01,751","Made a few people round here think twice
about your young bear."
954,"00:57:01,835","00:57:04,085",You just need to find that thief.
955,"00:57:04,168","00:57:05,918","Oh, we're trying."
956,"00:57:06,001","00:57:08,876","Don't suppose you know where he is,
do you, Feathers?"
957,"00:57:08,960","00:57:10,751",He's behind you.
958,"00:57:11,376","00:57:13,960","- Sorry, what?
- Coo-ee!"
959,"00:57:14,543","00:57:16,710","- Mary?
- Oh, hello, Phoenix."
960,"00:57:16,793","00:57:17,835",Why don't you come on in?
961,"00:57:17,918","00:57:21,001","I want to hear all about
the investigation. Yeah?"
962,"00:57:21,918","00:57:24,668","Mysterious things
have been happening all over town."
963,"00:57:24,751","00:57:25,751","Oh, yes?"
964,"00:57:25,835","00:57:28,960","Strange characters turning up
at every landmark in that book."
965,"00:57:29,043","00:57:31,835","- Are they?
- I don't know."
966,"00:57:32,501","00:57:34,126",Perhaps it's just a coincidence.
967,"00:57:34,210","00:57:37,251","Henry says I let my imagination
get the better of me."
968,"00:57:37,335","00:57:39,418","Well, you're an artist, Mary, like me."
969,"00:57:39,501","00:57:44,126","Our imaginations run free
like bison upon the plain."
970,"00:57:44,210","00:57:46,918","But can I just say,
in this particular case,"
971,"00:57:47,001","00:57:49,418","I think dear old Henry
might have a point."
972,"00:57:49,960","00:57:51,960","- Do you?
- But, I do have"
973,"00:57:52,043","00:57:55,251","a little bit of good news
that might turn your frown upside down."
974,"00:57:55,418","00:57:56,668","- Oh, yes?
- It looks..."
975,"00:57:56,751","00:57:58,293","fingers, fingers, fingers,"
976,"00:57:58,376","00:58:01,043","as though the funding may be
coming through for my one-man show."
977,"00:58:01,126","00:58:04,293","- Oh. Right.
- It's an evening of monologue and song,"
978,"00:58:04,376","00:58:06,293","featuring some of
my better known characters."
979,"00:58:06,376","00:58:08,168",Would you like a little preview?
980,"00:58:08,251","00:58:09,418",Um...
981,"00:58:09,501","00:58:13,793","Picture this scene.
Darkness, then suddenly, spotlight."
982,"00:58:13,876","00:58:15,418",Me... ping!
983,"00:58:15,501","00:58:18,543",♪ Listen to the rain on the roof
984,"00:58:18,626","00:58:21,626","♪ Go pit pitty pat, pit pitty pat sit"
985,"00:58:21,710","00:58:25,376","Oh, Mary, you look sad.
You don't like musicals?"
986,"00:58:25,460","00:58:28,710","No. No, no, no.
I suppose it just seems so unfair."
987,"00:58:28,793","00:58:31,043",Paddington's in prison and yet...
988,"00:58:31,835","00:58:34,793","- life carries on.
- Oh, I know."
989,"00:58:34,876","00:58:38,460","It must be so hard to accept
that he won,"
990,"00:58:38,585","00:58:41,335",that man with the dazzling blue eyes.
991,"00:58:41,418","00:58:44,126",I beg your pardon?
992,"00:58:44,210","00:58:46,876","The man in the poster.
Your wonderful drawing."
993,"00:58:47,668","00:58:50,418","Yes, but...
how do you know he had blue eyes?"
994,"00:58:51,376","00:58:54,210","- Hm?
- It's just a pencil sketch."
995,"00:58:59,001","00:59:00,001",Ooh.
996,"00:59:01,001","00:59:04,876","Well, I must have coloured him in."
997,"00:59:04,960","00:59:06,543","- Yeah.
- Phoenix Buchanan?"
998,"00:59:06,626","00:59:08,626",He's a master of disguise.
999,"00:59:08,710","00:59:10,835","- She's gone mad.
- Think about it, Henry."
1000,"00:59:10,918","00:59:13,335","Someone out there knows
about the Kozlova fortune, right?"
1001,"00:59:13,418","00:59:14,668",Alleged fortune.
1002,"00:59:14,751","00:59:16,960","Knuckles said we weren't looking
for a criminal gang."
1003,"00:59:17,043","00:59:18,835","- Knuckles?
- Because there was no gang."
1004,"00:59:18,918","00:59:22,126","- It was one man.
- Feathers knew all along..."
1005,"00:59:22,210","00:59:24,585","- Feathers? Who's Feathers?
- Hm?"
1006,"00:59:24,668","00:59:28,585","- The parrot at the news-stand?
- No..."
1007,"00:59:28,668","00:59:31,126","Can we just return to Planet Earth
for a moment?"
1008,"00:59:31,210","00:59:35,335","Phoenix Buchanan is a highly respected,
award-winning actor"
1009,"00:59:35,418","00:59:37,418",and a member of our Platinum Club.
1010,"00:59:37,543","00:59:40,376","- He is not a petty thief.
- Hang on a minute, Henry..."
1011,"00:59:40,501","00:59:42,293","But let's just assume I'm wrong,
shall we?"
1012,"00:59:42,376","00:59:44,585","- OK.
- And that the fortune teller,"
1013,"00:59:44,668","00:59:47,835","- career criminal and parrot are right.
- Mm."
1014,"00:59:47,918","00:59:50,960","May I remind you
that you don't actually have any proof?"
1015,"00:59:51,043","00:59:53,543","- Er...
- Now, if anyone wants me,"
1016,"00:59:53,626","00:59:55,335",I shall be putting up posters.
1017,"00:59:56,585","00:59:58,043",He's right.
1018,"00:59:58,126","01:00:00,251","Well, I believe you, Mary."
1019,"01:00:01,043","01:00:06,876","Actors are some of the most evil,
devious people on the planet."
1020,"01:00:06,960","01:00:10,126","- Are they?
- They lie for a living."
1021,"01:00:10,210","01:00:11,210",Crikey.
1022,"01:00:11,293","01:00:13,293","- If we're gonna catch one...
- Yes?"
1023,"01:00:13,376","01:00:15,418",...we're gonna need a foolproof plan.
1024,"01:00:16,418","01:00:18,043",Oh.
1025,"01:00:23,668","01:00:25,376",Hm?
1026,"01:00:27,293","01:00:29,168","- Paddington?
- Oh."
1027,"01:00:31,043","01:00:34,168",Paddington?
1028,"01:00:36,293","01:00:37,501",Knuckles?
1029,"01:00:37,585","01:00:39,710","Got a proposition for you, kid."
1030,"01:00:39,793","01:00:43,668","Me and the boys have been talking
and seems to us,"
1031,"01:00:43,751","01:00:46,793","if you're gonna clear your name,
you're gonna need our help."
1032,"01:00:46,876","01:00:48,668",The Browns may mean well but...
1033,"01:00:48,751","01:00:52,793","- It takes a thief to catch a thief.
- Ohh."
1034,"01:00:52,876","01:00:56,918","Now, if we could figure a way
out of here and hit the streets,"
1035,"01:00:57,001","01:00:58,876",we'd find this guy soon enough.
1036,"01:00:58,960","01:01:01,918",But that would mean... escape.
1037,"01:01:02,001","01:01:04,335",It certainly would. And we got a plan.
1038,"01:01:04,418","01:01:07,043","But it's a four-man job
so we need your help."
1039,"01:01:07,501","01:01:08,668","What do you say, kid?"
1040,"01:01:09,293","01:01:11,168","It's very kind of you, Knuckles, but..."
1041,"01:01:11,251","01:01:13,626","I don't think Aunt Lucy
would like the idea of us..."
1042,"01:01:13,710","01:01:15,668",breaking out of prison.
1043,"01:01:15,751","01:01:19,626","The Browns will find the real thief.
I just need to be patient."
1044,"01:01:20,126","01:01:21,876","You may not wanna hear this, kid,"
1045,"01:01:21,960","01:01:27,168","but sooner or later, the Browns, well..."
1046,"01:01:27,710","01:01:29,460",they'll forget you.
1047,"01:01:29,543","01:01:31,001",They always do.
1048,"01:01:31,585","01:01:33,460",They'll miss one visit.
1049,"01:01:33,543","01:01:34,918",Then two.
1050,"01:01:35,710","01:01:37,251","Before you know it,"
1051,"01:01:38,085","01:01:40,001",you won't have a home to go back to.
1052,"01:01:41,168","01:01:44,043","You're wrong, Knuckles.
You're all wrong."
1053,"01:01:44,126","01:01:46,210",The Browns aren't like that.
1054,"01:01:46,293","01:01:49,168","They'll come tomorrow
and they'll have good news."
1055,"01:01:49,251","01:01:50,460",You'll see.
1056,"01:01:56,335","01:01:57,793",Hello?
1057,"01:01:57,876","01:01:59,751","It's Judy Brown
from The Portobello Express."
1058,"01:01:59,835","01:02:00,835",Come in.
1059,"01:02:00,918","01:02:02,960","So what's this for, darlings?"
1060,"01:02:03,043","01:02:04,668","- School newspaper?
- Yes."
1061,"01:02:04,751","01:02:07,960","We thought the agent of the Phoenix
Buchanan would be really interesting."
1062,"01:02:08,043","01:02:09,335",And you'd be right.
1063,"01:02:09,460","01:02:12,043","But I've got two minutes,
so we better make it snappy."
1064,"01:02:12,126","01:02:15,126","And I've only given you that
because you've brought breakfast."
1065,"01:02:15,335","01:02:17,418","Nice buns, by the way."
1066,"01:02:19,668","01:02:21,001",Here he comes.
1067,"01:02:21,710","01:02:24,126","Hello, Joe. What a surprise!"
1068,"01:02:24,210","01:02:25,710",What are you doing here?
1069,"01:02:25,793","01:02:27,835",Posting letters. How's Paddington?
1070,"01:02:27,918","01:02:31,668","- Oh, he's a tough wee bear.
- Yeah, he is. Well, send him my best."
1071,"01:02:31,751","01:02:33,710","- I will. Thank you, Joe.
- Bye."
1072,"01:02:33,793","01:02:34,793",Bye-bye.
1073,"01:02:45,710","01:02:47,168",Mr Buchanan.
1074,"01:02:48,251","01:02:51,001","So, when can we expect to see
Mr Buchanan back on stage?"
1075,"01:02:51,085","01:02:53,668","Phoenix? Oh,
I wouldn't hold your breath, darling."
1076,"01:02:53,835","01:02:57,710","No, no, no, don't get me wrong.
He's a terrific actor."
1077,"01:02:57,793","01:03:00,918","- But there is a teensy little problem.
- Really?"
1078,"01:03:01,001","01:03:06,251","He won't work with other people.
Thinks they ""dilute his talent""."
1079,"01:03:06,376","01:03:07,668",Miss Fanshaw.
1080,"01:03:07,751","01:03:09,335","Oh, I must scoot."
1081,"01:03:09,460","01:03:12,001","We're having lunch
with a big Broadway producer."
1082,"01:03:12,085","01:03:15,293","- Oh, where are you going?
- The Ritz, darling!"
1083,"01:03:16,126","01:03:18,168",Really nice buns.
1084,"01:03:26,210","01:03:28,335","Well, good heavens!
Come. Come."
1085,"01:03:29,918","01:03:31,751","The package
has been delivered."
1086,"01:03:31,835","01:03:34,835",Repeat. The package has been delivered.
1087,"01:03:35,293","01:03:37,251","Barkridge's, no less."
1088,"01:03:37,335","01:03:40,168","Lucky, lucky Phoenix. Whoo!"
1089,"01:03:45,751","01:03:47,918","- Hello?
- Phoenix."
1090,"01:03:48,001","01:03:50,251",Felicity! What a lovely surprise.
1091,"01:03:50,335","01:03:52,501","I was beginning to think
you'd lost my number."
1092,"01:03:52,585","01:03:54,126","I've got two minutes,"
1093,"01:03:54,251","01:03:56,168",so we better make it snappy.
1094,"01:03:56,251","01:03:57,293",OK...
1095,"01:03:57,460","01:03:58,876",We're having lunch
1096,"01:03:58,960","01:04:01,001",with a big Broadway producer.
1097,"01:04:01,085","01:04:05,043","Well, wonderful news. Yes, yes!
Where does one go?"
1098,"01:04:05,251","01:04:07,210","The Ritz, darling!"
1099,"01:04:07,960","01:04:09,210",I am on my way.
1100,"01:04:09,335","01:04:11,001","Nice buns, by the way."
1101,"01:04:12,835","01:04:13,835",I beg your pardon?
1102,"01:04:16,626","01:04:18,168",Really nice buns.
1103,"01:04:19,960","01:04:21,001","Thank you, darling."
1104,"01:04:21,793","01:04:25,751","I've never had any complaints
about Mr and Mrs Botty-cheek."
1105,"01:04:25,918","01:04:27,585",Yes!
1106,"01:04:27,710","01:04:30,001",Gloves. Keys.
1107,"01:04:30,126","01:04:32,918",And exit.
1108,"01:04:44,710","01:04:45,751",Mary?
1109,"01:04:46,835","01:04:49,960",Where all your dreams come true?
1110,"01:04:59,001","01:05:00,501",Open the window.
1111,"01:05:05,085","01:05:07,418","- Hello, darling.
- Have you gone insane?"
1112,"01:05:07,501","01:05:09,668","I know it's Phoenix
and I'm going to prove it."
1113,"01:05:09,751","01:05:11,210",This is breaking and entering!
1114,"01:05:11,293","01:05:13,626",We haven't broken anything.
1115,"01:05:15,501","01:05:18,710","Why would Phoenix want to steal
a pop-up book? He's a millionaire!"
1116,"01:05:18,793","01:05:21,501","That's where you're wrong.
He owes money all over town. Look."
1117,"01:05:21,585","01:05:23,876","So he's got a few bills.
I mean, everyone..."
1118,"01:05:23,960","01:05:26,043","Good grief,
the man spends a lot on face cream."
1119,"01:05:26,126","01:05:28,376","He hasn't got a penny to his name.
Now come on."
1120,"01:05:28,460","01:05:30,835","Let's find that book
and get out of here."
1121,"01:05:36,043","01:05:37,585",Cravat.
1122,"01:05:42,626","01:05:44,001","- Well?
- Nothing."
1123,"01:05:44,085","01:05:45,626",We must be missing something.
1124,"01:05:45,710","01:05:48,460","Unless there's nothing to find.
Now can we please go?"
1125,"01:05:49,001","01:05:51,168","- Look, Henry.
- What?"
1126,"01:05:51,293","01:05:52,335",The carpet.
1127,"01:05:52,418","01:05:54,376","Yes, it's lovely.
I'll order a swatch."
1128,"01:05:54,460","01:05:55,960","- Give me a leg-up.
- Oh..."
1129,"01:05:56,043","01:05:58,335","Quick, quick, quick, quick."
1130,"01:06:01,293","01:06:03,376",Yes!
1131,"01:06:07,335","01:06:09,376",A secret room.
1132,"01:06:09,460","01:06:11,918","- It's an attic.
- A secret attic."
1133,"01:06:12,001","01:06:13,751",It's an ordinary attic.
1134,"01:06:13,876","01:06:16,335","Every house in the street has one.
I mean, look,"
1135,"01:06:16,460","01:06:19,876","it's just a perfectly normal...
Oh, my God, he's a weirdo."
1136,"01:06:19,960","01:06:23,876","Look, Henry.
The nun. The thief. The king."
1137,"01:06:24,793","01:06:25,876",We were right!
1138,"01:06:26,710","01:06:28,501",Sorry. We?
1139,"01:06:28,585","01:06:30,751","Well, well, I mean, I, I never..."
1140,"01:06:32,168","01:06:34,085","- Quick!
- Get down, get down."
1141,"01:06:44,376","01:06:46,793","Quite frankly, ravishing!"
1142,"01:06:47,793","01:06:49,960",Hello?
1143,"01:06:53,001","01:06:54,001",Who goes there?
1144,"01:06:55,585","01:06:57,376",Reveal yourself.
1145,"01:07:03,376","01:07:04,418",Henry?
1146,"01:07:07,293","01:07:08,293","Hello, Phoenix."
1147,"01:07:09,585","01:07:11,501",What on earth are you doing here?
1148,"01:07:12,418","01:07:14,710",I might ask you the same thing.
1149,"01:07:14,835","01:07:17,960","Well, I live here. It's my house."
1150,"01:07:18,835","01:07:21,918",And I... insure it.
1151,"01:07:22,710","01:07:26,376","And for our Platinum Club members,
we perform"
1152,"01:07:26,460","01:07:30,668","an annual free home inspection
to verify your security arrangements."
1153,"01:07:30,793","01:07:32,710",In your pyjamas?
1154,"01:07:33,668","01:07:34,668",Hm-hmm.
1155,"01:07:34,751","01:07:36,126",With your wife?
1156,"01:07:36,251","01:07:38,876",So that all seems pretty secure.
1157,"01:07:39,543","01:07:41,710","- Oh, hello, Phoenix.
- Mary."
1158,"01:07:41,793","01:07:45,001","- Didn't hear you come in.
- She helps out when we're busy."
1159,"01:07:45,168","01:07:47,126","Oh, well, that sounds entirely..."
1160,"01:07:48,043","01:07:50,168","- plausible.
- Does it? Great!"
1161,"01:07:50,251","01:07:53,168","Well, I'm delighted to say
that everything seems tickety-boo."
1162,"01:07:53,293","01:07:54,626",Wonderful.
1163,"01:07:54,710","01:07:58,460","So, I'll nip back to the office
and get the boys to type that up ASAP."
1164,"01:07:58,543","01:08:00,668","- And we'll hope to see you soon.
- Indeed."
1165,"01:08:00,751","01:08:03,918",Perhaps next time not in your pyjamas.
1166,"01:08:06,168","01:08:08,918","- He's such a silly one.
- Ciao, now."
1167,"01:08:12,376","01:08:14,876","Oh, thank Larry it's there."
1168,"01:08:14,960","01:08:18,668","Thank Larry, Johnny
and all the ghosts of the avenue."
1169,"01:08:18,793","01:08:21,251","Yeah, well, that was close,
weren't it? Eh?"
1170,"01:08:21,376","01:08:24,335","- Too close, if you ask me.
- Hold your nerve, Macbeth."
1171,"01:08:24,460","01:08:27,668","Screw your courage to the
sticking place. We are so nearly there."
1172,"01:08:27,751","01:08:30,626","I have followed this lady
through the whole of London"
1173,"01:08:30,710","01:08:34,710","and collected every one
of her clever little clues."
1174,"01:08:34,793","01:08:36,960",Aye. But what do they mean?
1175,"01:08:37,043","01:08:39,501","It's just a jumble of letters, ain't it?"
1176,"01:08:39,585","01:08:43,001","Au contraire, mon ami.
Uh-uh. They are not letters at all."
1177,"01:08:43,085","01:08:47,126","- They are... musical notes.
- Indeed, Poirot."
1178,"01:08:47,710","01:08:52,335","And I believe I know
just where to play them."
1179,"01:08:55,210","01:08:57,210",Hold it!
1180,"01:08:57,293","01:09:00,043",That is an amazing story.
1181,"01:09:00,126","01:09:02,501",But all you can actually prove
1182,"01:09:02,585","01:09:05,168","is that Phoenix Buchanan
keeps his old costumes."
1183,"01:09:05,251","01:09:07,918",Bring me some hard evidence.
1184,"01:09:08,001","01:09:10,918","Bring me the book with his fingerprints
on and then you've got a case."
1185,"01:09:11,001","01:09:13,210","But until then,
there's nothing I can do."
1186,"01:09:13,293","01:09:14,335","- I'm sorry.
- What?"
1187,"01:09:14,418","01:09:17,376",Where she's... where's she going?
1188,"01:09:17,460","01:09:20,918","- What do we do now?
- I don't know."
1189,"01:09:21,001","01:09:24,501","Well, at least we can tell Paddington
we know who did it."
1190,"01:09:24,585","01:09:26,793","- Oh, no.
- What?"
1191,"01:09:26,876","01:09:29,210","- Oh, we've missed visiting.
- Oh."
1192,"01:09:29,335","01:09:31,001",Paddington...
1193,"01:10:58,043","01:10:59,543",Paddington!
1194,"01:10:59,626","01:11:01,460",Aunt Lucy.
1195,"01:11:09,460","01:11:12,460","- Aunt Lucy!
- Paddington."
1196,"01:11:15,293","01:11:17,501",What are you doing here?
1197,"01:11:17,585","01:11:20,001",I thought you'd be at home.
1198,"01:11:20,751","01:11:23,210",I'm afraid I don't have one any more.
1199,"01:11:23,585","01:11:26,626","You see, I'm in prison."
1200,"01:11:28,126","01:11:30,501",And even the Browns have forgotten me.
1201,"01:11:36,668","01:11:39,835",Paddington.
1202,"01:11:43,751","01:11:44,751",Knuckles?
1203,"01:11:45,501","01:11:48,960","Tonight's the night.
We leave at midnight."
1204,"01:11:49,043","01:11:52,376","You wanna clear your name,
it's now or never."
1205,"01:11:52,460","01:11:54,543",You in?
1206,"01:11:54,626","01:11:56,418",I'm in.
1207,"01:11:57,751","01:12:00,376","Right.
Time to call it a night."
1208,"01:12:00,460","01:12:02,751",Not much going on here anyway.
1209,"01:12:02,835","01:12:05,668",They've been good as gold recently.
1210,"01:12:13,210","01:12:15,001",Lights out.
1211,"01:13:24,585","01:13:25,876",Ooh!
1212,"01:13:30,210","01:13:33,293",Ah!
1213,"01:13:43,960","01:13:45,543","Ooh, sandwiches."
1214,"01:13:46,168","01:13:48,960","- Paddington!
- Coming."
1215,"01:14:35,835","01:14:37,710","Good luck, little bear."
1216,"01:14:47,210","01:14:50,751","This is the life, lads."
1217,"01:14:50,835","01:14:52,793",Freedom!
1218,"01:15:07,210","01:15:09,043","Bring her down, Spoon."
1219,"01:15:28,001","01:15:30,626","There she is, boys.
Our ticket out of here."
1220,"01:15:31,585","01:15:34,376","What do you mean?
Where are we going?"
1221,"01:15:36,835","01:15:39,668","- Might as well tell him, Knucks.
- Tell me what?"
1222,"01:15:39,751","01:15:45,460","- Aren't we going to clear my name?
- Sorry, kid. Change of plan."
1223,"01:15:45,543","01:15:46,793",What?
1224,"01:15:46,876","01:15:49,710","- We're leaving the country.
- And you're coming with us."
1225,"01:15:49,793","01:15:53,126",But... you lied to me
1226,"01:15:53,210","01:15:58,126","Oh, hey, now, it wasn't like that.
We were doing you a favour."
1227,"01:15:58,210","01:16:00,251","If we told you the truth,"
1228,"01:16:00,335","01:16:02,918","you'd never have come along,
and it's better this way."
1229,"01:16:03,001","01:16:08,585",We are gonna make marmalade together.
1230,"01:16:08,668","01:16:10,585","But I don't want to, Knuckles."
1231,"01:16:10,668","01:16:13,293",I want to clear my name and go home.
1232,"01:16:13,376","01:16:15,418",And you said you'd help.
1233,"01:16:15,501","01:16:17,085",You promised.
1234,"01:16:21,460","01:16:22,876","Sorry, kid."
1235,"01:16:24,418","01:16:26,043",No can do.
1236,"01:16:26,960","01:16:29,251",Paddington!
1237,"01:16:30,710","01:16:31,918",Let him go.
1238,"01:16:32,626","01:16:35,376","If he wants to get himself arrested,"
1239,"01:16:36,043","01:16:37,335",that's his choice.
1240,"01:17:19,376","01:17:21,001","- Hello.
- Hello, Jonathan."
1241,"01:17:21,085","01:17:22,918",You've reached the Brown residence.
1242,"01:17:23,001","01:17:25,585","- We're not here now.
- But leave a message."
1243,"01:17:25,668","01:17:30,210","Hello, it's me... Paddington."
1244,"01:17:30,918","01:17:33,043",I hope you don't mind my calling.
1245,"01:17:33,126","01:17:38,918","I just wanted to let you know
I've broken out of prison, and, well..."
1246,"01:17:39,001","01:17:41,210",I suppose I'm on the run.
1247,"01:17:41,293","01:17:43,501",I didn't really mean to but...
1248,"01:17:43,585","01:17:46,710","Knuckles said that if we broke out,
he'd help clear my name"
1249,"01:17:48,001","01:17:50,001",and then I could come home.
1250,"01:17:50,918","01:17:54,251",But he's gone now and I'm on my own.
1251,"01:17:55,751","01:17:58,585",I don't really know why I'm calling.
1252,"01:17:58,668","01:18:01,668",I suppose I just wanted to say...
1253,"01:18:03,626","01:18:04,751",...goodbye.
1254,"01:18:31,585","01:18:34,043","- Oh! Hello?
- Paddington?"
1255,"01:18:34,126","01:18:36,418","Yes. Yes, it's Paddington!"
1256,"01:18:36,501","01:18:39,876","I'm so sorry I escaped, Mrs Brown,
but I thought you'd forgotten me."
1257,"01:18:39,960","01:18:42,251","Oh, we'd never forget you, Paddington."
1258,"01:18:42,335","01:18:44,085","- Paddington?
- You're family!"
1259,"01:18:44,168","01:18:45,668",We know who the thief was.
1260,"01:18:45,751","01:18:47,626","- It's Phoenix Buchanan.
- Mr Buchanan?"
1261,"01:18:47,710","01:18:49,585",But he's disappeared into thin air.
1262,"01:18:49,710","01:18:52,043","We've been looking for him
at every landmark in that book."
1263,"01:18:52,168","01:18:53,960",Every last page.
1264,"01:18:54,043","01:18:55,960","""Where all your dreams come true."""
1265,"01:18:57,001","01:18:58,168",Why do you say that?
1266,"01:18:58,251","01:19:00,626","Oh, it was written on the last page
of the pop-up book."
1267,"01:19:00,710","01:19:04,126","- Always made me think of Aunt Lucy.
- That's very bizarre."
1268,"01:19:04,210","01:19:05,210",Is it?
1269,"01:19:05,293","01:19:09,335","I found that exact same phrase on
a scrap of paper in Phoenix's house."
1270,"01:19:09,418","01:19:12,293","- Really?
- I'm sure I've seen that before."
1271,"01:19:12,418","01:19:13,835",Look.
1272,"01:19:13,918","01:19:16,543","- ""Where all your dreams come true.""
- The organ?"
1273,"01:19:16,668","01:19:18,835","That must be where
Madame Kozlova hid her fortune."
1274,"01:19:18,918","01:19:21,543","- Let's get to the fair.
- It's too late. They're leaving today."
1275,"01:19:21,626","01:19:24,543","- From Paddington Station.
- At 6:35."
1276,"01:19:25,001","01:19:27,543","- There's still time.
- Paddington, head for the station."
1277,"01:19:27,626","01:19:29,668","If we can find Phoenix
and get hold of that book,"
1278,"01:19:29,793","01:19:31,501",his fingerprints will prove everything.
1279,"01:19:31,585","01:19:34,835","But that's miles away, Mr Brown. I..."
1280,"01:19:37,751","01:19:38,918",I'll see you there.
1281,"01:19:39,001","01:19:40,918",Clear the road!
1282,"01:19:41,001","01:19:43,460",This is a refuse emergency!
1283,"01:19:43,543","01:19:44,876",Sorry!
1284,"01:19:45,460","01:19:48,960","Fellow citizens,
I've just received intelligence."
1285,"01:19:49,043","01:19:52,626","The bear has escaped
and may be heading this way."
1286,"01:19:52,751","01:19:56,918","I have raised the neighbourhood
panic level to ""wild hysteria""."
1287,"01:19:57,001","01:19:58,668","Get out of the way, Mr Curry!"
1288,"01:19:58,751","01:20:00,835",Paddington's not coming this way!
1289,"01:20:00,918","01:20:02,293",He's gonna clear his name.
1290,"01:20:02,376","01:20:05,585","- And we're gonna bring him home!
- We don't want him here."
1291,"01:20:05,668","01:20:08,376","No, of course you don't. You never have."
1292,"01:20:08,460","01:20:12,418","As soon as you set eyes on that bear,
you made up your mind about him."
1293,"01:20:12,501","01:20:14,668","Well, Paddington's not like that."
1294,"01:20:14,793","01:20:18,585","He looks for the good in all of us
and somehow, he finds it."
1295,"01:20:19,001","01:20:21,668","It's why he makes friends
wherever he goes."
1296,"01:20:21,751","01:20:25,835","And it's why Windsor Gardens
is a happier place whenever he's around."
1297,"01:20:25,918","01:20:29,293","He wouldn't hesitate
if any of us needed help."
1298,"01:20:29,376","01:20:33,460","So stand aside, Mr Curry,
cos we're coming through!"
1299,"01:20:42,501","01:20:44,085","Nice try, Brown."
1300,"01:20:44,168","01:20:46,335",Your plan seems to have stalled.
1301,"01:20:46,418","01:20:47,710",Like your vehicle.
1302,"01:20:47,793","01:20:51,168","Try the choke. Go on, try the choke.
You're flooding it."
1303,"01:20:51,251","01:20:53,918","- Clutch down, second gear, Mr Brown.
- What?"
1304,"01:20:54,001","01:20:55,501","- What you doing?
- After three."
1305,"01:20:55,585","01:20:56,626","- What's going on?
- Three."
1306,"01:20:56,710","01:20:59,251","You're illegally perambulating
on a public highway."
1307,"01:20:59,335","01:21:01,001",Put your backs into it.
1308,"01:21:01,085","01:21:03,001",Do not push that vehicle!
1309,"01:21:03,085","01:21:04,585",Bring Paddington home.
1310,"01:21:04,668","01:21:07,085","- Thank you.
- Go, go, go! Oh!"
1311,"01:21:18,543","01:21:22,460","Right, Paddington, stay low
and remember, you're a bin."
1312,"01:21:26,918","01:21:31,043","You're a bin. You're a bin.
Just an ordinary bin going for a walk."
1313,"01:21:36,418","01:21:38,876","- Thank you.
- You're welcome."
1314,"01:21:39,751","01:21:42,543","Nothing to see here,
Officer. Just a bin."
1315,"01:21:42,626","01:21:44,001",Hm.
1316,"01:21:44,918","01:21:46,168",Quite good being a bin.
1317,"01:22:01,793","01:22:02,876",Gentlemen.
1318,"01:22:03,835","01:22:06,001",Hmm.
1319,"01:22:24,293","01:22:25,710",Paddington!
1320,"01:22:25,793","01:22:27,126",Mr Brown!
1321,"01:22:27,210","01:22:29,251","Quickly, he's on board!"
1322,"01:22:31,085","01:22:33,418","Don't worry, I'll handle it myself!"
1323,"01:22:33,501","01:22:35,710",We've gotta catch up with that train.
1324,"01:22:35,793","01:22:38,126",But how?
1325,"01:22:40,668","01:22:42,043",I've got an idea.
1326,"01:22:43,710","01:22:45,876","Good morning, madam, sir.
Welcome on board."
1327,"01:22:45,960","01:22:48,335","- Fine. Thank you.
- May I offer you a glass of champagne?"
1328,"01:22:48,418","01:22:51,626","- Oh! Thank you. Very civilised, yes.
- Thank you so much. Very kind."
1329,"01:22:51,710","01:22:56,126","Nice to have a break after all I've been
through with that beastly bear."
1330,"01:22:56,210","01:22:59,460","Boiler pressure, two-two-five.
Water, half a glass."
1331,"01:22:59,543","01:23:01,960","- Air brake, off.
- Nice work, J-Dog."
1332,"01:23:03,085","01:23:06,085","My name's not J-Dog.
It's Jonathan Brown."
1333,"01:23:06,168","01:23:08,001",And I like steam trains.
1334,"01:23:08,085","01:23:09,918","Oh! Oh, for goodness' sake."
1335,"01:23:10,001","01:23:11,668","- I'm so sorry.
- Get off!"
1336,"01:23:11,751","01:23:13,418","- Ssh, ssh.
- Stop it, stop it!"
1337,"01:23:13,501","01:23:14,918","Don't shush me, Gertrude."
1338,"01:23:15,001","01:23:17,543","I have just been spilled upon
by a chilled liquid."
1339,"01:23:17,626","01:23:21,210",Gerald. I want you to shush.
1340,"01:23:23,418","01:23:24,918","Yes, Gertrude."
1341,"01:23:25,001","01:23:28,043",...news from the BBC.
1342,"01:23:28,126","01:23:32,668","Four convicts made a daring escape
from Portobello Prison last night."
1343,"01:23:32,751","01:23:35,293","The prisoners all appear to have
vanished without a trace..."
1344,"01:23:36,460","01:23:39,626","...except Paddington Brown,
who was seen boarding a fair train"
1345,"01:23:39,710","01:23:42,251",bound for Bristol. Police are closing in
1346,"01:23:42,335","01:23:44,335",and expect to make an arrest soon.
1347,"01:23:45,960","01:23:47,085",Poor little fella.
1348,"01:23:48,710","01:23:51,168",Must be somewhere down there right now.
1349,"01:23:51,251","01:23:54,085","Shouldn't we help him, Knuckles?"
1350,"01:23:54,168","01:23:57,168","How? We go back down there,
they won't just lock us up,"
1351,"01:23:57,251","01:24:01,335","- they'll throw away the key!
- I know, but... he's our friend."
1352,"01:24:02,126","01:24:03,460",Stick to the plan.
1353,"01:24:05,626","01:24:08,043","I don't do nothin' for no one
for nothin'."
1354,"01:24:31,043","01:24:32,335","Well, Grandfather."
1355,"01:24:33,376","01:24:35,293",The moment of truth.
1356,"01:24:39,251","01:24:40,251",D.
1357,"01:24:41,960","01:24:43,043",D.
1358,"01:24:45,293","01:24:47,960",A. A.
1359,"01:24:48,710","01:24:51,668",The book.
1360,"01:24:53,876","01:24:55,293",Ah!
1361,"01:24:59,001","01:25:01,710","- What's he doing?
- I don't know."
1362,"01:25:02,293","01:25:04,710","- Paddington!
- He can't hear us."
1363,"01:25:04,876","01:25:08,168","- Can this thing go any faster?
- I can try but I need more coal."
1364,"01:25:08,251","01:25:11,001","- I'm on it.
- Pull alongside. I'm going across."
1365,"01:25:11,085","01:25:12,543","- I'll come with you.
- Judy!"
1366,"01:25:12,668","01:25:14,793",Just you try and stop us!
1367,"01:25:16,251","01:25:17,251","Come on, then!"
1368,"01:25:52,460","01:25:54,668","- You ready?
- Yep."
1369,"01:25:54,751","01:25:56,710",Go!
1370,"01:26:07,460","01:26:10,793","Open your mind
and your legs will follow."
1371,"01:26:18,793","01:26:20,793","- Mr Brown!
- Mrs Bird!"
1372,"01:26:23,126","01:26:24,335",C.
1373,"01:26:28,001","01:26:30,335",And finally... E.
1374,"01:26:33,585","01:26:35,918",It works!
1375,"01:26:49,460","01:26:51,751",Ooh.
1376,"01:26:55,501","01:26:57,251",Hello.
1377,"01:26:57,376","01:27:00,126",Aren't you pretty?
1378,"01:27:00,501","01:27:04,043","West End, here I come."
1379,"01:27:06,501","01:27:07,876",M-Morning.
1380,"01:27:09,335","01:27:11,960",No!
1381,"01:27:12,043","01:27:15,085","What was it? Er, D. F."
1382,"01:27:15,293","01:27:17,710",D.
1383,"01:27:17,876","01:27:20,293",Come back with that book!
1384,"01:27:40,460","01:27:43,835","Where do you think you're going, bear?"
1385,"01:27:43,960","01:27:47,001","It's a train. It comes to an end,"
1386,"01:27:47,168","01:27:48,543","like all of us, alas."
1387,"01:27:48,626","01:27:50,835",Oh.
1388,"01:27:50,960","01:27:52,960",Whoops!
1389,"01:27:54,460","01:27:58,001","Exit bear, pursued by an actor..."
1390,"01:28:00,251","01:28:02,876",Phoenix Buchanan.
1391,"01:28:03,626","01:28:05,043",Mrs Bird?
1392,"01:28:05,168","01:28:07,293","Oh, so now you remember me?"
1393,"01:28:07,460","01:28:10,043","Well, I never."
1394,"01:28:10,168","01:28:11,543",The cavalry.
1395,"01:28:11,626","01:28:15,168","An old crone, a little girl
and an insurance man."
1396,"01:28:15,251","01:28:17,251",What am I going to do?
1397,"01:28:17,376","01:28:19,126","I'll tell you exactly
what I'm going to do."
1398,"01:28:19,251","01:28:20,293",Hm?
1399,"01:28:20,418","01:28:22,793","I'm going to bloomin' well
biff you on the nose."
1400,"01:28:22,876","01:28:24,793",Not a very good idea.
1401,"01:28:26,126","01:28:28,835","Stage combat, level four."
1402,"01:28:29,710","01:28:32,335","Well, where I come from, laddie,"
1403,"01:28:32,418","01:28:34,918","they teach you never
to bring a knife to a gunfight."
1404,"01:28:36,293","01:28:39,543","I think you'll find
that fires plastic darts."
1405,"01:28:41,793","01:28:42,918",So it does.
1406,"01:28:43,793","01:28:46,501",Whereas this sword looks very sharp.
1407,"01:28:47,168","01:28:49,793","Back you go. All of you, back."
1408,"01:28:59,876","01:29:02,668","And for you, sir, the jumbo pavlova."
1409,"01:29:02,751","01:29:03,751",Enjoy.
1410,"01:29:06,418","01:29:10,376","Oh, hello, Your Honour.
The hair is looking lovely."
1411,"01:29:15,126","01:29:16,210",Paddington!
1412,"01:29:16,335","01:29:19,585",Mrs Brown! Um...
1413,"01:29:19,668","01:29:22,210",Ah. I've got an idea!
1414,"01:29:22,876","01:29:27,001","Good. Good. Excellent.
Now for your furry friend."
1415,"01:29:37,626","01:29:39,793","Slow down, Jonathan."
1416,"01:29:45,626","01:29:47,168",Coo-ee!
1417,"01:29:47,293","01:29:49,543",What a clever little plan.
1418,"01:29:55,501","01:29:58,460",Don't worry. I know a wee trick
1419,"01:29:58,543","01:30:00,960",Harry Houdini used to do.
1420,"01:30:16,501","01:30:18,918","Jump, Paddington! I'll catch you."
1421,"01:30:20,043","01:30:21,835",No!
1422,"01:30:23,835","01:30:26,001","- Ah!
- No!"
1423,"01:30:34,543","01:30:36,460","Bye-bye, bear."
1424,"01:30:53,876","01:30:54,960",Bull's-eye!
1425,"01:31:15,501","01:31:17,960","Stop the train, Jonathan!"
1426,"01:32:54,001","01:32:55,751","Let's go, lads."
1427,"01:33:21,210","01:33:22,835",Ah!
1428,"01:33:29,460","01:33:31,585","Knuckles, you came back."
1429,"01:33:31,668","01:33:35,293","- Can't make marmalade on my own, can I?
- Thank you, everyone."
1430,"01:33:35,376","01:33:37,293",Paddington?
1431,"01:33:37,376","01:33:41,001","- He's burning up.
- Better get the little fella to bed."
1432,"01:33:42,043","01:33:43,793","- Mum!
- Paddington!"
1433,"01:33:43,876","01:33:44,918",He's not well.
1434,"01:33:45,001","01:33:48,335","Don't worry, he's gonna
be fine. Aren't you, little buddy?"
1435,"01:34:12,668","01:34:15,335","- Paddington!
- Where am I?"
1436,"01:34:15,460","01:34:17,001",Take it easy now.
1437,"01:34:17,168","01:34:21,335","You gave us a wee scare,
but you're home now."
1438,"01:34:21,460","01:34:23,835","- Home?
- That's right. Look."
1439,"01:34:23,918","01:34:26,126","The police realised
they made a terrible mistake."
1440,"01:34:26,251","01:34:29,918","Phoenix Buchanan has been arrested,
and I might add,"
1441,"01:34:30,001","01:34:32,460","is no longer a member
of our Platinum Club."
1442,"01:34:32,543","01:34:35,168","- Then...
- You're a free bear."
1443,"01:34:35,335","01:34:38,585","- How long have I been asleep?
- Three days."
1444,"01:34:38,710","01:34:41,126",Three days? But that means...
1445,"01:34:41,293","01:34:45,001","- It's Aunt Lucy's birthday.
- And I never sent her anything."
1446,"01:34:45,126","01:34:48,668","- It's all right, Paddington.
- But it isn't all right, Mrs Brown."
1447,"01:34:48,793","01:34:53,251","You see, Aunt Lucy did so much for me
when I was a cub."
1448,"01:34:53,335","01:34:56,001","Without her,
I'd never have come to London."
1449,"01:34:56,085","01:35:00,501","And, I suppose all I ever really wanted
was to make her proud."
1450,"01:35:01,501","01:35:04,460","But now she's going to wake up
on her birthday with no present"
1451,"01:35:04,543","01:35:06,960",and think I've let her down completely.
1452,"01:35:07,043","01:35:11,543","Oh, you great goose!
She won't think that at all."
1453,"01:35:11,668","01:35:12,835",Won't she?
1454,"01:35:13,710","01:35:15,335",Come with us.
1455,"01:35:17,751","01:35:19,793",Here he is!
1456,"01:35:27,376","01:35:28,668",What are you all doing here?
1457,"01:35:28,751","01:35:31,251","- We wanted to say thank you.
- Thank you?"
1458,"01:35:31,335","01:35:34,001","- For everything you've done for us.
- Yes."
1459,"01:35:34,085","01:35:35,960","If it wasn't for you,
we'd never have met."
1460,"01:35:36,043","01:35:37,793",You helped me pass my exam.
1461,"01:35:37,876","01:35:39,918","I would be permanently
locked out of my house."
1462,"01:35:41,293","01:35:44,376","I'd say you've rather a lot
to be proud of."
1463,"01:35:44,501","01:35:45,501",Oh.
1464,"01:35:45,585","01:35:48,668","When we heard the police
wanted the popping book for evidence,"
1465,"01:35:48,793","01:35:52,293","we thought we'd find Aunt Lucy
another present."
1466,"01:35:52,376","01:35:54,001",So we all clubbed together.
1467,"01:35:54,168","01:35:56,960","I pulled in a few favours
from my old Air Force chums."
1468,"01:35:57,043","01:35:59,418",And we think she's going to love it.
1469,"01:35:59,501","01:36:01,418",But... what is it?
1470,"01:36:02,418","01:36:05,585","You wanted to get that book so
