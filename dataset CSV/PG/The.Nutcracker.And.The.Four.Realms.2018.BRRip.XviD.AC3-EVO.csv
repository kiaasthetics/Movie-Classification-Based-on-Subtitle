3,"00:01:29,701","00:01:33,236","Shh! Fritz.
Now, be very still."
4,"00:01:33,238","00:01:35,304",This is how we'll do it.
5,"00:01:35,306","00:01:37,408","With science,
mechanics..."
6,"00:01:38,810","00:01:40,512",and a bit of luck.
7,"00:01:43,147","00:01:46,482","First, we've got energy."
8,"00:01:46,484","00:01:49,722","The heat from the candle
will make the balloon rise."
9,"00:02:01,734","00:02:03,600","With the momentum
from the ball..."
10,"00:02:03,602","00:02:06,435",that hits the monkey...
11,"00:02:06,437","00:02:08,640","...and pivots
onto the bellows."
12,"00:02:11,242","00:02:13,279",Which blows the longboat.
13,"00:02:15,614","00:02:18,749","Giving us Newton's
third law of physics..."
14,"00:02:18,751","00:02:22,586","that says every action
has an equal..."
15,"00:02:22,588","00:02:24,390","- and opposite...?
- Reaction."
16,"00:02:27,125","00:02:29,093","- Yes!
- Yes!"
17,"00:02:30,696","00:02:33,564",Do they bite?
18,"00:02:33,566","00:02:35,599",I suppose they do.
19,"00:02:35,601","00:02:37,602",If you're horrid to them.
20,"00:02:39,271","00:02:41,204","Oh, there you are."
21,"00:02:41,206","00:02:43,841","Up and down I've been
looking for you rascals."
22,"00:02:43,843","00:02:45,175","Worn out, I am."
23,"00:02:45,177","00:02:46,476","We were
catching a mouse."
24,"00:02:46,478","00:02:49,146","Well, if you catch one,
I'm not cooking it."
25,"00:02:49,148","00:02:50,647",Too many bones.
26,"00:02:50,649","00:02:52,215","Now, come on, be quick."
27,"00:02:52,217","00:02:54,286","We have a lot to do
before this evening."
28,"00:02:54,920","00:02:56,186",There you are!
29,"00:02:56,188","00:02:57,354","I've been looking
all over for you."
30,"00:02:57,356","00:02:58,755",Look at the state of you.
31,"00:02:58,757","00:03:00,325","We were trying
to catch a mouse..."
32,"00:03:00,327","00:03:03,161","with toys and momentum
and matches and..."
33,"00:03:03,163","00:03:04,295",Matches?
34,"00:03:04,297","00:03:05,897",It was Clara's idea.
35,"00:03:05,899","00:03:08,265","Catching mice
on Christmas Eve?"
36,"00:03:08,267","00:03:09,634","Honestly, Clara."
37,"00:03:09,636","00:03:11,569",We nearly had him.
38,"00:03:11,571","00:03:13,771","What were you gonna do with
him when you caught him?"
39,"00:03:13,773","00:03:17,207","Teach him tricks.
He could dance."
40,"00:03:17,209","00:03:20,279","Ah. There you are.
What do we think?"
41,"00:03:20,880","00:03:22,847","It's wonderful, Father."
42,"00:03:22,849","00:03:24,549","With a few adjustments,
perhaps."
43,"00:03:24,551","00:03:25,820",It's not how Mother did it.
44,"00:03:26,787","00:03:27,788",Fritz.
45,"00:03:33,893","00:03:37,362","Um... Now, children,
I have some presents for you."
46,"00:03:37,364","00:03:38,798",But it's not Christmas Day.
47,"00:03:39,833","00:03:40,867",They're from your mother.
48,"00:03:42,736","00:03:46,339","She asked me to give them
to you on Christmas Eve."
49,"00:03:47,807","00:03:49,541",That one's for you.
50,"00:03:50,945","00:03:52,847","- Louise.
- Thank you."
51,"00:03:53,881","00:03:55,750",Soldiers! Yay!
52,"00:03:57,450","00:03:59,283",Clara.
53,"00:03:59,285","00:04:01,452","The enemy
has found our location!"
54,"00:04:04,257","00:04:06,357",We've been ambushed!
55,"00:04:06,359","00:04:07,928",They're from both sides!
56,"00:04:09,229","00:04:11,364",It's Mother's favorite.
57,"00:04:11,831","00:04:13,601","Yes. Yes, it was."
58,"00:04:22,910","00:04:24,244","What is it, Clara?"
59,"00:04:29,282","00:04:31,550",It's an egg of some sort.
60,"00:04:31,552","00:04:33,585","What's inside?
Is it jewelry?"
61,"00:04:33,587","00:04:34,822",I don't know.
62,"00:04:37,591","00:04:38,958",It's locked.
63,"00:04:38,960","00:04:40,528",Are you sure it opens?
64,"00:04:41,595","00:04:43,765",There's a keyhole. Here.
65,"00:04:44,900","00:04:46,498",But there's no key.
66,"00:04:46,500","00:04:49,969","Why would Mother give me this
without a key?"
67,"00:04:49,971","00:04:52,673","It's just a silly egg
that doesn't open."
68,"00:04:55,910","00:04:57,445","It's not just
a silly egg, Fritz."
69,"00:04:57,812","00:04:58,946",Clara.
70,"00:05:00,916","00:05:02,284",Clara!
71,"00:05:16,965","00:05:20,299","""Everything you need
is inside."""
72,"00:05:20,301","00:05:21,302",Clara.
73,"00:05:26,541","00:05:28,276",Is everything all right?
74,"00:05:29,611","00:05:30,645",No.
75,"00:05:31,947","00:05:34,316",This is a pin tumbler lock.
76,"00:05:35,984","00:05:38,551","It's impossible to open
without a key."
77,"00:05:38,553","00:05:39,688",I see.
78,"00:05:41,356","00:05:43,356","Well, why don't you
get ready for the party,"
79,"00:05:43,358","00:05:44,993","and then you can
work it out tomorrow."
80,"00:05:49,665","00:05:51,932","Clara, Christmas comes..."
81,"00:05:51,934","00:05:54,467",whether we like it or not.
82,"00:05:54,469","00:05:56,371","We must do our best
to enjoy it."
83,"00:05:57,472","00:05:59,441",I don't want to enjoy it.
84,"00:06:02,011","00:06:04,044","I don't want to enjoy anything
right now."
85,"00:06:04,046","00:06:05,812","Well, that may be
the case..."
86,"00:06:05,814","00:06:08,650","but it's important to maintain
traditions as a family."
87,"00:06:09,584","00:06:11,353",It's what's expected of us.
88,"00:06:13,090","00:06:14,922","I don't care
what's expected."
89,"00:06:14,924","00:06:16,692","- Well, you should.
- Father?"
90,"00:06:19,462","00:06:21,330",It's almost time to go.
91,"00:06:23,833","00:06:25,501",Do I look all right?
92,"00:06:28,704","00:06:29,839",Yes.
93,"00:06:30,540","00:06:31,808","Yes, indeed."
94,"00:06:35,410","00:06:37,413",Please get your sister ready.
95,"00:06:39,549","00:06:42,418","You must be gentle
with him, Clara."
96,"00:06:43,753","00:06:45,555",I wish Mother was here.
97,"00:06:45,922","00:06:47,590",We all do.
98,"00:06:54,430","00:06:56,730",I have to open this.
99,"00:06:56,732","00:06:57,832",You'll work it out.
100,"00:06:57,834","00:07:00,669","You're an extremely
clever girl, just like Mother."
101,"00:07:00,671","00:07:03,171","I don't feel
very clever lately."
102,"00:07:03,173","00:07:04,439",Maybe you should spend
103,"00:07:04,441","00:07:05,372","a little less time
in the attic..."
104,"00:07:05,374","00:07:08,877","and a little more time
in the real world."
105,"00:07:08,879","00:07:11,915","The real world just doesn't
make sense to me anymore."
106,"00:07:12,649","00:07:14,816","You must try, Clara."
107,"00:07:14,818","00:07:16,452",If only for Father.
108,"00:07:18,121","00:07:22,658","Father is acting
as if nothing has changed."
109,"00:07:25,429","00:07:27,629",But everything has changed.
110,"00:07:27,631","00:07:30,031","""D."" It's Drosselmeyer."
111,"00:07:30,033","00:07:31,935",He must have made this.
112,"00:07:32,936","00:07:35,203",And maybe he can open it!
113,"00:07:35,205","00:07:37,472",Good.
114,"00:07:37,474","00:07:39,507","Now, will you let me
finish with your hair?"
115,"00:07:39,509","00:07:41,676",Yes. But please hurry.
116,"00:08:06,070","00:08:07,502",It is important to be
117,"00:08:07,504","00:08:09,238",on your best behavior tonight.
118,"00:08:09,240","00:08:11,742","That means remembering our
manners at dinner. Fritz!"
119,"00:08:14,078","00:08:16,848","I do want one dance
with you, Louise."
120,"00:08:17,916","00:08:19,651","And you, Clara."
121,"00:08:21,519","00:08:23,653","- Do I have to dance?
- Yes, you do."
122,"00:08:23,655","00:08:25,821","And no disappearing
tonight either."
123,"00:08:25,823","00:08:28,624","Mingle and engage
with the guests."
124,"00:08:28,626","00:08:29,761",What about me?
125,"00:08:30,795","00:08:32,061",What about you?
126,"00:08:32,063","00:08:33,765",Who will dance with me?
127,"00:08:54,752","00:08:56,552",Yay! Godfather's house.
128,"00:08:56,554","00:08:58,254","Last one in
is a nincompoop."
129,"00:09:01,760","00:09:03,827","Master Drosselmeyer
welcomes"
130,"00:09:03,829","00:09:06,098",Mr. and Mrs. Jeremiah Jones.
131,"00:09:08,167","00:09:12,668","Doctor and Mrs. McDonald,
Timothy and Ezekiel McDonald."
132,"00:09:12,670","00:09:14,171",Magic!
133,"00:09:14,173","00:09:15,604","Fritz, come on."
134,"00:09:15,606","00:09:18,177","How do we
get them back?"
135,"00:09:22,214","00:09:23,746",The Stahlbaum family.
136,"00:09:23,748","00:09:26,219","Benjamin, Louise,
Fritz, and Clara."
137,"00:10:03,356","00:10:04,656",Godfather?
138,"00:10:20,673","00:10:21,739",Hello.
139,"00:10:24,077","00:10:26,212","Have you seen
Godfather anywhere?"
140,"00:10:27,814","00:10:29,147",He sees everything.
141,"00:10:29,149","00:10:31,282","Which can be a great help
to an old man."
142,"00:10:31,284","00:10:33,119",Godfather.
143,"00:10:33,887","00:10:35,121","Hello, Clara."
144,"00:10:35,788","00:10:37,022",I need your help.
145,"00:10:37,024","00:10:39,791","Ah. But I need
your help first."
146,"00:10:39,793","00:10:41,360",Look at this damn thing.
147,"00:10:44,265","00:10:46,233",Backwards.
148,"00:10:47,067","00:10:48,367",It moves...
149,"00:10:48,369","00:10:49,936",backwards.
150,"00:10:51,004","00:10:53,271","The mechanism
must be reversed."
151,"00:10:53,273","00:10:55,006","I know, but I can't,
for the life of me,"
152,"00:10:55,008","00:10:56,743",figure out why.
153,"00:10:58,878","00:10:59,880",May I?
154,"00:11:00,247","00:11:02,247",Please.
155,"00:11:07,088","00:11:09,088","It looks like the idler wheel
has slipped."
156,"00:11:09,090","00:11:10,189",Hmm.
157,"00:11:10,191","00:11:11,256",Causing the pinion ring
158,"00:11:11,258","00:11:12,826","to engage
the secondary drive gear."
159,"00:11:13,260","00:11:14,725",Pliers.
160,"00:11:14,727","00:11:15,728",Ah.
161,"00:11:35,683","00:11:36,784",There.
162,"00:11:40,454","00:11:41,720",Ah.
163,"00:11:41,722","00:11:44,291",Clever girl.
164,"00:11:45,692","00:11:47,861",I knew you could do it.
165,"00:11:47,863","00:11:49,929","All right now, Miss Clara..."
166,"00:11:49,931","00:11:53,335","Why are you down here with me
instead of upstairs, dancing?"
167,"00:11:54,935","00:11:57,103","I need your help
with something."
168,"00:11:57,105","00:11:58,240",With this.
169,"00:12:00,342","00:12:01,409",Ah.
170,"00:12:04,379","00:12:08,149","I haven't seen this
in a very long time."
171,"00:12:11,820","00:12:15,255","I made it
for another clever girl..."
172,"00:12:15,257","00:12:16,823",who came to live with me
173,"00:12:16,825","00:12:18,693","after she was orphaned
at a very early age."
174,"00:12:20,295","00:12:22,228","- Mother.
- Mmm-hmm."
175,"00:12:22,230","00:12:24,898","You know,
when she first arrived..."
176,"00:12:24,900","00:12:27,867",she wouldn't leave her room.
177,"00:12:27,869","00:12:30,303","Spent day and night
locked away..."
178,"00:12:30,305","00:12:33,141","her head buried
in her books."
179,"00:12:34,309","00:12:37,744","So, what did you do?"
180,"00:12:37,746","00:12:40,347","I left this
outside her door."
181,"00:12:40,349","00:12:42,884","And, over time,
she came to trust me..."
182,"00:12:43,486","00:12:45,486",but most importantly...
183,"00:12:45,488","00:12:46,888",herself.
184,"00:12:49,357","00:12:52,058","And now
she's given it to you."
185,"00:12:52,060","00:12:54,362","But she didn't
leave me the key."
186,"00:12:55,530","00:12:57,732",You must miss her terribly.
187,"00:12:58,099","00:13:00,434",I know I do.
188,"00:13:00,436","00:13:04,338","And I can't imagine
how your father must feel."
189,"00:13:04,340","00:13:07,007","All Father cares about
is appearances."
190,"00:13:07,009","00:13:08,375",No.
191,"00:13:08,377","00:13:11,180","My guess is he feels
every bit the way you do."
192,"00:13:12,048","00:13:13,480","Remember, Clara,"
193,"00:13:13,482","00:13:15,917","some locks are harder
to pick than others."
194,"00:13:17,253","00:13:19,821","And I'm afraid this one
is especially tricky."
195,"00:13:21,490","00:13:23,156",Pin tumblers.
196,"00:13:23,158","00:13:24,858",I know.
197,"00:13:24,860","00:13:26,295",I tried.
198,"00:13:27,230","00:13:29,230",Oh.
199,"00:13:29,232","00:13:30,498",It's time.
200,"00:13:30,500","00:13:34,170","Here, you run along
and I'll be up shortly."
201,"00:13:34,837","00:13:36,237",It's Christmas Eve.
202,"00:13:36,239","00:13:39,075","It's going to be
a magical night."
203,"00:13:48,952","00:13:51,188","Yes, I know, my friend."
204,"00:13:52,022","00:13:53,887",It won't be easy.
205,"00:13:53,889","00:13:55,992","But it was her
mother's dying wish..."
206,"00:13:57,194","00:13:59,263",so go keep an eye on her.
207,"00:14:14,845","00:14:16,578",Ladies and gentlemen...
208,"00:14:16,580","00:14:19,547","my favorite part
of Christmas..."
209,"00:14:19,549","00:14:22,484","my favorite part
of this evening..."
210,"00:14:22,486","00:14:24,886",I present to you...
211,"00:14:24,888","00:14:26,021",your gifts.
212,"00:14:45,510","00:14:47,210","""Fritz."""
213,"00:14:51,448","00:14:52,816",Clara.
214,"00:14:54,184","00:14:55,984",Where have you been?
215,"00:14:55,986","00:14:57,452","I've been looking
everywhere for you."
216,"00:14:57,454","00:14:59,387","I was in Drosselmeyer's
workshop trying to open..."
217,"00:14:59,389","00:15:01,023","I told you
not to disappear."
218,"00:15:01,025","00:15:02,960","And I was expecting
to dance with you."
219,"00:15:04,095","00:15:06,495","Father, I really don't
want to dance."
220,"00:15:06,497","00:15:10,335","Why, Clara, must you think
only about yourself?"
221,"00:15:11,669","00:15:14,505",I could ask the same of you.
222,"00:15:24,982","00:15:26,483","Come look!
Come over here!"
223,"00:15:26,485","00:15:28,017","- Come look!
- I need to go."
224,"00:15:28,019","00:15:29,952","- No, this way.
- Okay."
225,"00:15:31,657","00:15:33,324",I found mine.
226,"00:15:58,517","00:16:00,249",Look at my present.
227,"00:16:02,253","00:16:04,286",A nutcracker soldier?
228,"00:16:04,288","00:16:05,456",What do you think of him?
229,"00:16:06,457","00:16:07,990",How handsome.
230,"00:16:07,992","00:16:09,392",He's your boyfriend.
231,"00:17:10,623","00:17:11,990",What?
232,"00:17:13,359","00:17:14,527",Where?
233,"00:18:36,110","00:18:37,579","Clever, Godfather."
234,"00:18:38,345","00:18:39,346",Clever.
235,"00:18:52,560","00:18:54,295",That's mine!
236,"00:18:58,265","00:18:59,300",My key!
237,"00:19:35,870","00:19:37,739",Bring back my key!
238,"00:19:48,517","00:19:50,318",Filthy mouse.
239,"00:20:15,378","00:20:17,680",A nutcracker soldier.
240,"00:20:27,590","00:20:28,722",Halt!
241,"00:20:28,724","00:20:29,957",Who goes there?
242,"00:20:29,959","00:20:32,493","- It's just me!
- State your purpose, Just Me."
243,"00:20:32,495","00:20:35,563","No, my name is Clara,
and I must cross this bridge."
244,"00:20:35,565","00:20:36,564",Impossible.
245,"00:20:36,566","00:20:37,431","Nobody crosses the bridge
to the Fourth Realm..."
246,"00:20:37,433","00:20:39,834","without a direct order
from the regents."
247,"00:20:39,836","00:20:41,570",Fourth Realm?
248,"00:20:42,638","00:20:44,238",Where am I?
249,"00:20:44,240","00:20:46,240","You're in
the Christmas Tree Forest."
250,"00:20:46,242","00:20:47,976","But that is
the Fourth Realm..."
251,"00:20:47,978","00:20:50,244","which is currently at war
with the other three realms."
252,"00:20:50,246","00:20:51,445",War?
253,"00:20:51,447","00:20:52,846","That is correct,
Miss Clara Just Me."
254,"00:20:52,848","00:20:56,283","No. My name isn't
Clara Just Me."
255,"00:20:56,285","00:20:57,918",It's Stahlbaum.
256,"00:20:57,920","00:20:59,821",Clara Stahlbaum.
257,"00:20:59,823","00:21:01,790",Stahlbaum?
258,"00:21:01,792","00:21:03,694","Are you a relation
to Marie Stahlbaum?"
259,"00:21:04,361","00:21:05,493",She's my mother.
260,"00:21:05,495","00:21:06,795","Forgive me, Your Majesty!"
261,"00:21:06,797","00:21:09,198","I didn't recognize you,
Princess Clara."
262,"00:21:09,700","00:21:10,932",Princess?
263,"00:21:10,934","00:21:12,299",Captain Phillip Hoffman.
264,"00:21:12,301","00:21:14,401","At your service,
Your Majesty."
265,"00:21:14,403","00:21:15,570",Maybe I have been
266,"00:21:15,572","00:21:16,840","spending too much time
in the attic."
267,"00:21:19,910","00:21:22,877","Captain Hoffman,
I'd like to cross the river."
268,"00:21:22,879","00:21:24,479","But the Fourth Realm
is a very..."
269,"00:21:24,481","00:21:27,582","I have to go,
Captain Hoffman."
270,"00:21:27,584","00:21:29,352","Is that an order,
Princess Clara?"
271,"00:21:30,454","00:21:33,423",Yes. I suppose it is.
272,"00:21:35,425","00:21:37,692",And you can call me Clara.
273,"00:21:37,694","00:21:38,829","Is that an order, too?"
274,"00:21:40,831","00:21:42,330",Yes.
275,"00:21:42,332","00:21:44,367","Very well.
Call me Captain."
276,"00:22:07,524","00:22:08,656",Jingles!
277,"00:22:08,658","00:22:10,792","Wake up, you lazy horse."
278,"00:22:10,794","00:22:12,830",Jingles!
279,"00:22:22,373","00:22:24,807","Guess I'm not
in London anymore."
280,"00:22:24,809","00:22:27,710","London?
What's London?"
281,"00:22:27,712","00:22:29,377",It's where I'm from.
282,"00:22:29,379","00:22:32,114","Clara?
What are we looking for?"
283,"00:22:32,116","00:22:34,415",A gold key.
284,"00:22:34,417","00:22:36,619","It must be important,
this key."
285,"00:22:36,621","00:22:38,556",It is. Very.
286,"00:22:40,691","00:22:42,725","Are you scared, Captain?"
287,"00:22:42,727","00:22:44,961",Me? Never.
288,"00:22:46,798","00:22:49,032","Are you out here
all by yourself, Captain?"
289,"00:22:49,034","00:22:50,466",Of course.
290,"00:22:50,468","00:22:52,701","I'm the only nutcracker
in the entire kingdom."
291,"00:22:52,703","00:22:54,804","- Don't you get lonely?
- Lonely?"
292,"00:22:54,806","00:22:57,006",No. I know my place.
293,"00:22:57,008","00:22:58,974",That's good enough for me.
294,"00:22:58,976","00:23:00,811",You're lucky.
295,"00:23:00,813","00:23:02,412",I wish I knew mine.
296,"00:23:03,448","00:23:05,682","But you're
the daughter of the queen."
297,"00:23:05,684","00:23:07,918",Surely you know your place.
298,"00:23:07,920","00:23:09,420",I'm afraid not.
299,"00:23:10,789","00:23:12,589","That's why I have
to find that key."
300,"00:23:12,591","00:23:14,791","Then we shall
do exactly that."
301,"00:23:14,793","00:23:16,492",Stop!
302,"00:23:16,494","00:23:17,794",There he is!
303,"00:23:17,796","00:23:19,430",Mouserinks!
304,"00:23:20,498","00:23:23,700","Ah! That diabolical
little rodent."
305,"00:23:23,702","00:23:25,902","We need to approach
with extreme caution!"
306,"00:23:27,873","00:23:29,008",Coward!
307,"00:23:30,676","00:23:31,710","Clara, wait!"
308,"00:23:40,519","00:23:43,620",Give me my key back...
309,"00:23:43,622","00:23:46,923",you horrid little mouse!
310,"00:23:46,925","00:23:49,961",That key belongs to me!
311,"00:23:49,963","00:23:51,662",Come on out of there!
312,"00:23:51,664","00:23:53,197",Come on!
313,"00:23:55,567","00:23:56,936",Clara!
314,"00:24:04,676","00:24:06,143",Let me go!
315,"00:24:06,145","00:24:07,579",Put me down!
316,"00:24:09,681","00:24:11,818",Put me down!
317,"00:24:12,719","00:24:14,018",Captain!
318,"00:24:14,020","00:24:16,120","Captain, help me!"
319,"00:24:16,122","00:24:17,123",Captain!
320,"00:24:25,131","00:24:26,530",Run!
321,"00:24:26,532","00:24:28,465","- What is that thing?
- It's the Mouse King."
322,"00:24:28,467","00:24:29,769","Don't look back.
Just keep running."
323,"00:24:45,885","00:24:47,654",I think we've lost him.
324,"00:24:49,622","00:24:51,791",Show yourself!
325,"00:24:52,859","00:24:54,558",Oh. Jingles.
326,"00:24:54,560","00:24:56,060","Jingles, good boy."
327,"00:24:56,062","00:24:57,561","Clara, we need to go."
328,"00:24:57,563","00:24:59,197","- Not without my key.
- But..."
329,"00:24:59,199","00:25:03,035",Who's intruding in my realm?
330,"00:25:03,037","00:25:04,838","Okay. Maybe going
is a good idea."
331,"00:25:06,040","00:25:10,242","Is that you, Clara Stahlbaum?"
332,"00:25:10,244","00:25:11,712",Why are you here?
333,"00:25:13,847","00:25:16,214",I have your key.
334,"00:25:16,216","00:25:18,283","It's a trap.
If you go..."
335,"00:25:18,285","00:25:19,918","you'll never come back.
No one ever does."
336,"00:25:19,920","00:25:20,921",Clara!
337,"00:25:21,754","00:25:24,458",Come here and get your key!
338,"00:25:25,793","00:25:26,860",Clara!
339,"00:25:27,695","00:25:29,695",What was that?
340,"00:25:29,697","00:25:31,697",That was Mother Ginger.
341,"00:25:31,699","00:25:33,934","And she doesn't like
intruders."
342,"00:25:49,050","00:25:50,116",Halt.
343,"00:25:50,118","00:25:51,284","I need to
get to the palace."
344,"00:25:51,286","00:25:53,286","I'm sure you do,
sunshine."
345,"00:25:53,288","00:25:55,054","But we have
procedures around here."
346,"00:25:55,056","00:25:56,189",Protocols.
347,"00:25:56,191","00:25:57,556",I'm Captain Phillip Hoffman
348,"00:25:57,558","00:25:58,757","and I demand
you let us through."
349,"00:25:58,759","00:26:01,094","- Oh! ""Demand,"" is it now?
- ""Demand,"" oh."
350,"00:26:01,096","00:26:03,096","Captain Hoffman of the famous
Hoffmans, is it?"
351,"00:26:03,098","00:26:04,663","Well, if we'd known
you were coming,"
352,"00:26:04,665","00:26:06,132","we would have
rolled out the red carpet..."
353,"00:26:06,134","00:26:09,935","booked the trumpeteers.
Captain Hoffman has arrived."
354,"00:26:09,937","00:26:12,672","For goodness' sake,
she's a princess."
355,"00:26:12,674","00:26:14,140","Well, they
all say that these days."
356,"00:26:14,142","00:26:15,808","Wishing don't make it so,
my love."
357,"00:26:15,810","00:26:18,711","Overindulgent fathers,
that's what I put it down to."
358,"00:26:18,713","00:26:20,013",Would it help if I told you
359,"00:26:20,015","00:26:21,681","that her name
was Clara Stahlbaum?"
360,"00:26:21,683","00:26:23,950","Daughter of
Marie Stahlbaum?"
361,"00:26:25,653","00:26:27,220","All right, just a few
questions, Your Highness,"
362,"00:26:27,222","00:26:28,587",and you'll be on your way.
363,"00:26:28,589","00:26:29,724",This is ridiculous.
364,"00:26:31,226","00:26:32,859","Have you had any contact
with mice"
365,"00:26:32,861","00:26:34,293","or mouse-like
entities recently?"
366,"00:26:34,295","00:26:36,263","- I was in the Fourth Realm.
- Thank you."
367,"00:26:36,265","00:26:37,897","Do you have any cheese
or cheese-based products"
368,"00:26:37,899","00:26:39,099",on or about your person?
369,"00:26:39,101","00:26:40,666","- I...
- Thank you."
370,"00:26:40,668","00:26:42,136","How would you describe
your sympathies"
371,"00:26:42,138","00:26:44,937",towards rodents in general?
372,"00:26:44,939","00:26:46,739","- Well...
- Thank you. Good, right."
373,"00:26:46,741","00:26:48,174","Well, that is
the survey complete."
374,"00:26:48,176","00:26:50,377","There's no ink
coming out your pen."
375,"00:26:50,379","00:26:52,645","You may pass, please."
376,"00:26:52,647","00:26:55,281","Attention!
Lower the bridge!"
377,"00:26:55,283","00:26:56,349",Thank you.
378,"00:26:56,351","00:26:57,552",Lower the drawbridge!
379,"00:27:11,867","00:27:14,168","Is that
Marie's daughter?"
380,"00:27:14,170","00:27:15,804",She's so beautiful.
381,"00:27:19,641","00:27:22,008","Make way
for the princess."
382,"00:27:38,094","00:27:39,628",Mother.
383,"00:27:48,737","00:27:49,871",Your Excellencies...
384,"00:27:49,873","00:27:53,043","may I present
Miss Clara Stahlbaum."
385,"00:27:56,246","00:27:58,379",Is it true? It is true.
386,"00:27:58,381","00:27:59,780",I'm Hawthorne...
387,"00:27:59,782","00:28:01,915","Regent of
the Land of Flowers..."
388,"00:28:01,917","00:28:03,220",at your most humble service.
389,"00:28:04,120","00:28:05,819",I am Shiver...
390,"00:28:05,821","00:28:07,855","Regent of the Land
of Snowflakes, ma'am."
391,"00:28:07,857","00:28:09,056",An honor.
392,"00:28:09,058","00:28:11,226","And the Regent
of the Land of Sweets..."
393,"00:28:11,228","00:28:13,161",Sugar Plum.
394,"00:28:13,163","00:28:15,163","I never thought
this day would come."
395,"00:28:15,165","00:28:17,365","Oh, tell us, we long for news."
396,"00:28:17,367","00:28:19,369","How is our queen, dear Marie?"
397,"00:28:20,837","00:28:23,273","- My mother?
- We miss her so."
398,"00:28:25,876","00:28:26,943",You don't know?
399,"00:28:27,844","00:28:29,712","My mother, she's..."
400,"00:28:32,149","00:28:33,214",She died.
401,"00:28:35,419","00:28:37,787","Marie, dead?"
402,"00:28:39,756","00:28:41,958","We are so sorry
for your loss."
403,"00:28:42,792","00:28:45,994",To leave life so young...
404,"00:28:45,996","00:28:48,999","She was the most beautiful,
wonderful..."
405,"00:28:50,368","00:28:52,867",She meant everything to us.
406,"00:28:52,869","00:28:54,070",Everything.
407,"00:29:01,746","00:29:03,145","This is
your mother's throne..."
408,"00:29:03,147","00:29:05,347",Your Grace.
409,"00:29:05,349","00:29:08,152","Have you come
to save us, Clara?"
410,"00:29:09,786","00:29:11,120",No.
411,"00:29:12,290","00:29:13,355",I'm sorry.
412,"00:29:13,357","00:29:16,791","I didn't even know this place
existed before today."
413,"00:29:16,793","00:29:18,826","You see, I was looking for
a Christmas present"
414,"00:29:18,828","00:29:19,863",from my godfather.
415,"00:29:20,298","00:29:22,200",I love Christmas!
416,"00:29:22,900","00:29:24,168",What's Christmas?
417,"00:29:25,537","00:29:28,304","And then I ran into this
horrible little mouse."
418,"00:29:28,306","00:29:29,805",Mouse?
419,"00:29:29,807","00:29:31,807","And that's when
I met the captain."
420,"00:29:31,809","00:29:33,309","We barely escaped
Mother Ginger"
421,"00:29:33,311","00:29:34,511",and the Mouse King.
422,"00:29:34,513","00:29:36,946",You met Mother Ginger?
423,"00:29:36,948","00:29:38,547","Oh, my dear Clara..."
424,"00:29:38,549","00:29:40,950",you're lucky to be alive.
425,"00:29:40,952","00:29:42,952","You must promise
never to go back"
426,"00:29:42,954","00:29:44,286","to the Land of Amusements,
Clara!"
427,"00:29:44,288","00:29:45,554",Oh! Hawthorne!
428,"00:29:45,556","00:29:48,158","Its title has been
rescinded, Hawthorne!"
429,"00:29:48,160","00:29:51,328","Oh! Of course.
I meant the Fourth Realm."
430,"00:29:51,330","00:29:52,828",Apologies.
431,"00:29:52,830","00:29:55,298",I'm just so upset.
432,"00:29:55,300","00:29:57,167","Forget I ever mentioned
the Land of..."
433,"00:29:57,169","00:29:58,303",Oh!
434,"00:30:01,373","00:30:03,573",Oh.
435,"00:30:03,575","00:30:05,941","It's pure fortune
you got out alive."
436,"00:30:05,943","00:30:08,110","No one ever escapes
from the Fourth Realm."
437,"00:30:08,112","00:30:09,479",Hawthorne is right.
438,"00:30:09,481","00:30:11,381","We can't risk
losing our princess"
439,"00:30:11,383","00:30:12,583","when she's only
just arrived."
440,"00:30:12,585","00:30:14,918","- But...
- And talking of arriving..."
441,"00:30:14,920","00:30:17,954","we need to organize a pageant
to celebrate your coming."
442,"00:30:17,956","00:30:20,257","- Oh!
- And a tour of the realms."
443,"00:30:20,259","00:30:22,492","Oh, this is so exciting!"
444,"00:30:22,494","00:30:25,163",I love a pageant!
445,"00:30:29,468","00:30:32,435",That sounds lovely...
446,"00:30:32,437","00:30:35,306","but I have to get back
to Drosselmeyer's party."
447,"00:30:41,980","00:30:43,115",She doesn't know.
448,"00:30:45,385","00:30:46,985","Time is very different
in the realms."
449,"00:30:47,352","00:30:48,985",Very.
450,"00:30:48,987","00:30:50,387",Come.
451,"00:30:50,389","00:30:52,856",I'll show you.
452,"00:30:52,858","00:30:55,191","Princess Clara, I'll be
returning to my post now."
453,"00:30:55,193","00:30:57,129",You are not leaving me.
454,"00:30:57,529","00:30:59,032",That's an order.
455,"00:31:02,602","00:31:04,168",Sugar Plum...
456,"00:31:04,170","00:31:05,903",who's Mother Ginger?
457,"00:31:05,905","00:31:07,638","Well, she used to be a regent."
458,"00:31:07,640","00:31:10,107","Just like me
and Hawthorne and Shiver."
459,"00:31:10,109","00:31:12,443","She was the Regent
of the Land of..."
460,"00:31:12,445","00:31:13,513",Amusements.
461,"00:31:15,113","00:31:16,114",But now...
462,"00:31:16,616","00:31:18,850",she is banished.
463,"00:31:19,985","00:31:21,918",Why was she...
464,"00:31:21,920","00:31:23,921",banished?
465,"00:31:23,923","00:31:26,357","We had no choice, Clara."
466,"00:31:26,359","00:31:29,026","She tried to take control
of the other realms..."
467,"00:31:29,028","00:31:30,361",by force.
468,"00:31:30,363","00:31:33,297","But when her evil
intentions became clear..."
469,"00:31:33,299","00:31:35,966","even her own people
deserted her."
470,"00:31:35,968","00:31:37,335",And her realm...
471,"00:31:37,337","00:31:39,205",fell to ruin.
472,"00:31:40,139","00:31:41,539",That's so tragic.
473,"00:31:43,943","00:31:46,177","But things are
looking up"
474,"00:31:46,179","00:31:48,946","now that you're here,
dear Clara."
475,"00:31:48,948","00:31:52,317","Come! It's time
to put your mind at ease."
476,"00:31:55,154","00:31:58,323",See anything familiar?
477,"00:31:58,325","00:32:01,326","It looks like the clock
in Godfather's ballroom."
478,"00:32:01,328","00:32:02,927",But that's impossible.
479,"00:32:02,929","00:32:04,230",Is it?
480,"00:32:09,168","00:32:11,238",Stand very still.
481,"00:32:29,690","00:32:31,125",I'm back.
482,"00:32:32,359","00:32:34,928","Everything seems to be
going so slowly."
483,"00:32:36,130","00:32:38,263",How is this possible?
484,"00:32:38,265","00:32:41,403","Your world moves much more
slowly than our world."
485,"00:32:44,371","00:32:45,473",Fritz and Louise.
486,"00:32:46,140","00:32:47,508",There they are.
487,"00:32:51,145","00:32:52,513","And look, there's Father."
488,"00:32:57,184","00:32:58,352",He looks...
489,"00:32:59,421","00:33:00,653",lost.
490,"00:33:00,655","00:33:03,958","Everything looks different
from the realms."
491,"00:33:13,100","00:33:14,201",Voila.
492,"00:33:21,776","00:33:23,342",For the pageant.
493,"00:33:23,344","00:33:26,446","Which one
will you choose?"
494,"00:33:26,448","00:33:31,417","I'm not very good at dresses
and hair, shoes..."
495,"00:33:31,419","00:33:35,188","If I may be so bold
as to suggest that I help?"
496,"00:33:35,190","00:33:37,423","- Would you?
- It's my favorite thing!"
497,"00:33:37,425","00:33:40,393","Oh, we will not
disappoint them."
498,"00:33:40,395","00:33:43,264",You will look magnificent.
499,"00:33:48,671","00:33:50,771","Did my mother
ever talk about me?"
500,"00:33:50,773","00:33:54,140","Oh, yes. All the time."
501,"00:33:54,142","00:33:58,079","Sometimes it seemed as if
you were right here with us."
502,"00:33:59,247","00:34:01,216","Now, close your eyes."
503,"00:34:02,450","00:34:04,285",Close your eyes.
504,"00:34:10,191","00:34:13,062","Now, open your eyes."
505,"00:34:14,463","00:34:15,662",Do you like it?
506,"00:34:15,664","00:34:17,199",I love it.
507,"00:34:19,568","00:34:21,468",I look so different.
508,"00:34:21,470","00:34:24,740","You look like
the daughter of a queen."
509,"00:34:29,712","00:34:32,813","Ladies and gentlemen,
on this momentous day..."
510,"00:34:32,815","00:34:34,816","in the history
of the Four Realms..."
511,"00:34:34,818","00:34:39,319","We are proud and privileged
to present before you..."
512,"00:34:39,321","00:34:43,290","Clara Stahlbaum,
daughter of Queen Marie."
513,"00:35:01,211","00:35:03,244","They're all staring at me,
Sugar Plum."
514,"00:35:03,246","00:35:04,779",Of course.
515,"00:35:04,781","00:35:08,117","You're every inch
your mother's daughter."
516,"00:36:10,548","00:36:13,716","The ballet tells the story
of the Four Realms..."
517,"00:36:13,718","00:36:16,220","how your mother
discovered our world."
518,"00:36:43,882","00:36:46,350","First, the Land of Flowers."
519,"00:37:33,532","00:37:34,664",Now...
520,"00:37:34,666","00:37:35,967",the Land of Snowflakes.
521,"00:37:56,723","00:37:58,590",And the Land of Sweets.
522,"00:39:04,491","00:39:05,759",Mice?
523,"00:39:07,060","00:39:09,861","Now we're in
the Fourth Realm."
524,"00:39:09,863","00:39:12,631","Watch closely, Clara."
525,"00:39:12,633","00:39:14,933","This is where
our troubles began."
526,"00:39:14,935","00:39:16,737","With Mother Ginger
and the mice?"
527,"00:39:21,541","00:39:23,042",Beastly woman.
528,"00:39:23,044","00:39:25,046","There's nothing motherly
about her."
529,"00:40:24,005","00:40:28,040","Mother Ginger's the one
who began this war."
530,"00:40:28,042","00:40:30,510","I hope you'll be the one
to finish it."
531,"00:40:31,445","00:40:32,680",What do you mean?
532,"00:40:49,664","00:40:51,933","Come, I'll show you."
533,"00:40:55,237","00:40:58,138","Dear Queen Marie kept
Mother Ginger in line..."
534,"00:40:58,140","00:41:01,975","but now that she's gone,
we're utterly defenseless."
535,"00:41:01,977","00:41:03,810",I don't understand.
536,"00:41:03,812","00:41:06,914","You see, once we were
lifeless toys..."
537,"00:41:06,916","00:41:09,116",mere playthings for children.
538,"00:41:09,118","00:41:11,919","Then your mother arrived
and changed everything."
539,"00:41:11,921","00:41:14,689",She gave us life.
540,"00:41:15,958","00:41:17,092",How?
541,"00:41:18,726","00:41:19,794",With this.
542,"00:41:20,930","00:41:22,865",The Engine.
543,"00:41:24,267","00:41:25,866","This is
my mother's invention?"
544,"00:41:25,868","00:41:29,569","Yes.
The Engine made us real."
545,"00:41:29,571","00:41:32,072","And now we have feelings
just like you have."
546,"00:41:32,074","00:41:35,110","Happiness, sadness,
anger, love."
547,"00:41:35,878","00:41:37,577",Fear.
548,"00:41:37,579","00:41:39,579","There's plenty of that
going around."
549,"00:41:39,581","00:41:42,015","You're right,
sweet captain."
550,"00:41:42,017","00:41:43,517",Our spies tell us that
551,"00:41:43,519","00:41:44,985","Mother Ginger
is on the warpath..."
552,"00:41:44,987","00:41:46,821",gathering all her forces.
553,"00:41:46,823","00:41:48,957","The Engine
is the only way"
554,"00:41:48,959","00:41:51,826","that we can build an army
to defend ourselves."
555,"00:41:51,828","00:41:53,660",But it doesn't work.
556,"00:41:53,662","00:41:57,167","If we can't get it to work
again, then all is lost."
557,"00:41:58,234","00:41:59,833",Perhaps I could fix it.
558,"00:41:59,835","00:42:01,235",It's not broken.
559,"00:42:01,237","00:42:03,004","We're simply
missing the key."
560,"00:42:03,006","00:42:05,173","- Key?
- The key."
561,"00:42:05,175","00:42:08,075","We've searched hither and
yon throughout the kingdom."
562,"00:42:10,181","00:42:13,149","I fear your dear mother
must have taken it with her."
563,"00:42:14,651","00:42:16,252",But she never returned.
564,"00:42:17,654","00:42:19,589",A pin tumbler.
565,"00:42:25,862","00:42:27,762","Sugar Plum, look."
566,"00:42:27,764","00:42:29,629","This was a present
from my mother."
567,"00:42:29,631","00:42:31,598",The locks match.
568,"00:42:31,600","00:42:34,336",It must be the same key.
569,"00:42:34,338","00:42:37,607","This key of which
you speak..."
570,"00:42:38,275","00:42:39,741",where is it?
571,"00:42:39,743","00:42:41,843","That horrible
little mouse took it."
572,"00:42:41,845","00:42:43,112",Mouserinks!
573,"00:42:43,114","00:42:45,214",He's diabolical.
574,"00:42:45,216","00:42:47,749","But that means that
Mother Ginger has it."
575,"00:42:47,751","00:42:50,221","Oh, pooh!"
576,"00:42:52,922","00:42:56,290","Then we can't
make the army..."
577,"00:42:56,292","00:42:58,127",and we'll be annihilated.
578,"00:42:58,129","00:43:00,162","Unless we can bring
the key back."
579,"00:43:00,164","00:43:02,231",Get it back?
580,"00:43:02,233","00:43:03,932","I could go
to the Fourth Realm."
581,"00:43:03,934","00:43:06,335","Oh, no!
It's too, too dangerous!"
582,"00:43:06,337","00:43:08,771","I came here
to find that key."
583,"00:43:08,773","00:43:10,607","Clara, you're not
going back there."
584,"00:43:13,944","00:43:16,945","This must be why my mother
sent me here."
585,"00:43:16,947","00:43:18,380","I can't let
Mother Ginger destroy"
586,"00:43:18,382","00:43:19,547",everything she created.
587,"00:43:19,549","00:43:22,252","We were lucky to escape
with our lives the last time."
588,"00:43:22,254","00:43:24,122","Mother Ginger's more
dangerous than you know."
589,"00:43:24,822","00:43:27,058",I must get that key.
590,"00:44:01,093","00:44:02,991",You found him.
591,"00:44:02,993","00:44:04,160","He's your favorite,
isn't he?"
592,"00:44:04,162","00:44:06,664","Well, we can't have Christmas
without the nutcracker."
593,"00:44:07,731","00:44:10,434","I found him
at Drosselmeyer's."
594,"00:44:10,436","00:44:12,735","He reminds me of a land
I discovered"
595,"00:44:12,737","00:44:14,337",when I was a little girl...
596,"00:44:14,339","00:44:17,175","full of sweets and flowers
and the funniest people."
597,"00:44:18,710","00:44:20,343",That sounds wonderful.
598,"00:44:20,345","00:44:22,212",It was.
599,"00:44:22,214","00:44:24,781","Maybe you'll go there too
one day."
600,"00:44:24,783","00:44:26,351","Maybe you can
take me there."
601,"00:44:39,098","00:44:40,997","Are you all right, Mother?"
602,"00:44:40,999","00:44:42,335",I'm fine.
603,"00:44:43,768","00:44:46,203","I'd love to take you,
my darling."
604,"00:44:46,205","00:44:47,939","But there are
some journeys..."
605,"00:44:48,474","00:44:50,809",you have to go on alone.
606,"00:44:52,310","00:44:54,811","Clara, I know
you sometimes wish"
607,"00:44:54,813","00:44:56,081","you were more like
your sister."
608,"00:44:57,215","00:45:00,784","But I love you
because you're so different."
609,"00:45:00,786","00:45:05,789","You see the world
in a unique way."
610,"00:45:05,791","00:45:07,992","When you realize that's
your greatest strength..."
611,"00:45:07,994","00:45:11,028","you can change the world,
my girl."
612,"00:45:11,030","00:45:13,366",And I'll be watching you.
613,"00:45:14,500","00:45:16,369","Now, where are you
going to put him?"
614,"00:45:31,951","00:45:33,419",It's perfect.
615,"00:46:16,396","00:46:18,966","Oh, Mother,
it's so beautiful here."
616,"00:46:36,484","00:46:39,886","I don't know
if I can get the key back."
617,"00:46:41,222","00:46:42,990",And if I fail...
618,"00:46:44,091","00:46:47,428","this whole world
you discovered..."
619,"00:46:55,402","00:46:57,537",I wish you were here.
620,"00:47:00,408","00:47:02,308","So you can tell me
that I'm doing"
621,"00:47:02,310","00:47:04,110","the right thing
like you used to."
622,"00:47:26,901","00:47:28,903",Thank you.
623,"00:47:48,424","00:47:50,426",Clara!
624,"00:47:51,560","00:47:54,026","Oh, I wish I could
come with you."
625,"00:47:54,028","00:47:55,162",You understand.
626,"00:47:55,164","00:47:57,431","But you'll have
my tippy-top top-notch"
627,"00:47:57,433","00:47:59,033","handpicked troops
to protect you."
628,"00:47:59,635","00:48:03,271","Good luck, my brave girl."
629,"00:48:08,076","00:48:10,444",Your most gracious majesty...
630,"00:48:10,446","00:48:12,179","Why are you
talking like that?"
631,"00:48:12,181","00:48:13,614","- Shh!
- Do it properly."
632,"00:48:13,616","00:48:16,616","- Your Majesty, we request...
- Look, we're volunteering."
633,"00:48:16,618","00:48:17,853",Yep. That.
634,"00:48:18,153","00:48:19,386",You?
635,"00:48:19,388","00:48:22,089","Don't say it like that. We're
trained killers, we are."
636,"00:48:22,091","00:48:23,423",Deadly.
637,"00:48:24,960","00:48:27,694",Attention!
638,"00:48:27,696","00:48:29,029","Pick up the dagger!
The dagger!"
639,"00:48:29,031","00:48:30,564","- By the right...
- Sorry."
640,"00:48:30,566","00:48:32,033",...turn!
641,"00:48:35,672","00:48:37,207",Squad march.
642,"00:49:30,326","00:49:32,126",Remember your training.
643,"00:49:32,128","00:49:33,628",Stay alert.
644,"00:49:33,630","00:49:35,031",I'm not alert.
645,"00:49:35,498","00:49:37,066",I'm scared.
646,"00:49:48,212","00:49:50,011","What's going on
up there?"
647,"00:49:50,013","00:49:51,415",Why have we stopped?
648,"00:49:52,483","00:49:55,149","Come on!
It's only a bit of fog!"
649,"00:50:52,476","00:50:53,744",What was that?
650,"00:51:12,364","00:51:13,598",Gather at the carousel!
651,"00:51:21,841","00:51:24,509","We can't fight
what we can't see."
652,"00:51:36,454","00:51:38,223","It's the mice!
They're under us!"
653,"00:51:49,735","00:51:51,537",Move it! Move it!
654,"00:51:56,776","00:51:57,841",Captain!
655,"00:52:00,580","00:52:02,211",Hang on!
656,"00:52:04,449","00:52:05,783",Clara!
657,"00:52:05,785","00:52:07,552",Let me go!
658,"00:52:09,856","00:52:11,555",Clara! Where are you?
659,"00:52:21,834","00:52:25,636","Well, if it isn't
Clara Stahlbaum."
660,"00:52:25,638","00:52:27,838",I've been expecting you.
661,"00:52:27,840","00:52:29,940","I'm here to reclaim
what you've taken from me"
662,"00:52:29,942","00:52:31,575",and from my mother.
663,"00:52:31,577","00:52:32,578",My key!
664,"00:52:33,311","00:52:34,815","Please, come in."
665,"00:52:50,496","00:52:51,662",Whee!
666,"00:52:57,704","00:53:00,438","♪ Clara Stahlbaum
Lovely Clara Stahlbaum ♪"
667,"00:53:00,440","00:53:02,240",Little Princess Clara.
668,"00:53:02,242","00:53:03,644",She looks like a goose!
669,"00:53:06,546","00:53:08,482",What a clumsy thing she is.
670,"00:53:11,685","00:53:13,217",Look out!
671,"00:53:16,823","00:53:18,422",Where are you going?
672,"00:53:18,424","00:53:19,425",Leaving so soon?
673,"00:53:20,694","00:53:21,927",Step right this way.
674,"00:53:23,731","00:53:25,599",We have a surprise for you.
675,"00:53:28,301","00:53:30,504",Have a seat.
676,"00:53:31,405","00:53:33,571",Bon voyage!
677,"00:53:33,573","00:53:34,741",Adios.
678,"00:53:50,625","00:53:52,694","Hands off, young lady!"
679,"00:53:57,565","00:53:59,965",You're Mother Ginger.
680,"00:53:59,967","00:54:03,468","And you're Queen Marie's
daughter, apparently."
681,"00:54:07,842","00:54:10,309",Yes.
682,"00:54:10,311","00:54:13,247","Now, what business brings you
to the Fourth Realm?"
683,"00:54:14,049","00:54:16,849","Don't you know
it's dangerous here?"
684,"00:54:16,851","00:54:19,452","I've come to get
what belongs to me."
685,"00:54:19,454","00:54:20,953",That key.
686,"00:54:20,955","00:54:23,022","If this key
belongs to anyone..."
687,"00:54:23,024","00:54:24,890",it belongs to your mother.
688,"00:54:24,892","00:54:26,525",No.
689,"00:54:26,527","00:54:27,793",She left it to me.
690,"00:54:27,795","00:54:29,897",Why would she give it to you?
691,"00:54:31,699","00:54:33,367","My mother, she..."
692,"00:54:33,936","00:54:35,637",she passed away.
693,"00:54:37,606","00:54:39,440",Queen Marie is dead?
694,"00:54:40,508","00:54:42,475",As if you care!
695,"00:54:42,477","00:54:43,944","You're trying to
destroy everything"
696,"00:54:43,946","00:54:45,379",my mother ever created.
697,"00:55:03,966","00:55:05,534","Look what you've done
to your own realm."
698,"00:55:06,969","00:55:08,101",You've ruined it.
699,"00:55:08,103","00:55:09,936",Whee!
700,"00:55:09,938","00:55:11,405",Clara!
701,"00:55:21,985","00:55:23,617",Look out!
702,"00:55:23,619","00:55:26,686",Clara! No!
703,"00:55:26,688","00:55:28,557",Whoa.
704,"00:55:35,964","00:55:38,031",Bring it back!
705,"00:55:38,033","00:55:40,467",Captain! I got the key.
706,"00:55:40,469","00:55:41,668",Get back here!
707,"00:55:41,670","00:55:43,804",She was different.
708,"00:55:43,806","00:55:45,473","Don't be fooled
by that little old lady act."
709,"00:55:45,475","00:55:46,440",The woman is deadly.
710,"00:55:46,442","00:55:49,544",That's a dangerous key!
711,"00:55:49,546","00:55:50,912",Foolish girl.
712,"00:55:57,619","00:56:01,721","Our future depends
on that girl, Mouserinks."
713,"00:56:01,723","00:56:03,392",To the palace!
714,"00:56:08,730","00:56:10,098",Captain...
715,"00:56:10,100","00:56:11,632",I need to stop.
716,"00:56:11,634","00:56:13,668","I have to open this.
It's important."
717,"00:56:13,670","00:56:15,069",All right.
718,"00:56:15,071","00:56:17,373",We should be safe here.
719,"00:56:51,541","00:56:53,076",It can't be.
720,"00:56:55,645","00:56:56,646",No.
721,"00:57:01,218","00:57:03,654",It's just a music box.
722,"00:57:05,055","00:57:08,657",But my mother told me...
723,"00:57:08,659","00:57:12,796","""Everything you need
is inside."""
724,"00:57:16,233","00:57:18,035",There's nothing here.
725,"00:57:18,869","00:57:19,937",There's music.
726,"00:57:22,840","00:57:24,508",I thought...
727,"00:57:25,609","00:57:28,177","I thought
if I found this key..."
728,"00:57:28,179","00:57:30,514",then I would find answers...
729,"00:57:31,849","00:57:34,118","that everything
would make sense."
730,"00:57:35,920","00:57:38,789","I'm just as lost
as when I arrived here."
731,"00:57:40,858","00:57:42,491",Here...
732,"00:57:42,493","00:57:43,926",take the key.
733,"00:57:43,928","00:57:45,895",Bring it to Sugar Plum.
734,"00:57:45,897","00:57:47,599",Where are you going?
735,"00:57:48,667","00:57:50,066","- Home.
- Home?"
736,"00:57:50,068","00:57:51,568","But, Clara, we need you here."
737,"00:57:54,571","00:57:55,740",No.
738,"00:57:56,707","00:57:59,844","Captain, you need my mother."
739,"00:58:02,680","00:58:04,182",She was a queen...
740,"00:58:05,716","00:58:06,982",and I'm not.
741,"00:58:06,984","00:58:08,850","I've never left my post,
you know."
742,"00:58:08,852","00:58:10,189",I knew my place.
743,"00:58:11,523","00:58:14,090",And I was happy.
744,"00:58:14,092","00:58:17,093","But when you told me you were
going into the Fourth Realm..."
745,"00:58:17,095","00:58:19,128",I knew I'd go with you.
746,"00:58:19,130","00:58:21,533","And it wasn't because
you're Marie's daughter..."
747,"00:58:23,234","00:58:25,702","but because
you have her same look..."
748,"00:58:25,704","00:58:28,037",of confidence...
749,"00:58:28,039","00:58:30,539",and determination.
750,"00:58:30,541","00:58:32,875","I don't feel very confident
right now."
751,"00:58:32,877","00:58:36,180","You just led a regiment of men
into the Fourth Realm..."
752,"00:58:36,182","00:58:38,650","and took back this key
from Mother Ginger."
753,"00:58:39,551","00:58:42,119","You're not lost,
Clara Stahlbaum."
754,"00:58:42,121","00:58:44,589",Your place is here.
755,"00:58:51,796","00:58:53,563",Thank you...
756,"00:58:53,565","00:58:54,599",Captain.
757,"00:59:02,174","00:59:03,876",It's time to save the kingdom.
758,"00:59:17,890","00:59:19,023",Clara!
759,"00:59:19,025","00:59:20,190",I have it!
760,"00:59:20,192","00:59:22,994","You clever girl!
Down, quick!"
761,"00:59:22,996","00:59:24,264",Quickly!
762,"00:59:26,099","00:59:27,332",Finally!
763,"00:59:27,334","00:59:30,303","How long I've waited
for this moment!"
764,"00:59:36,343","00:59:38,244",Wonderful!
765,"00:59:39,078","00:59:41,145",Bring me the tin soldiers.
766,"00:59:43,182","00:59:45,016",You can't use tin soldiers.
767,"00:59:45,018","00:59:47,218","Well, of course I can.
Don't be silly."
768,"00:59:47,220","00:59:49,254","You have no idea
how they'll behave."
769,"00:59:49,256","00:59:50,755",They're completely hollow.
770,"00:59:50,757","00:59:54,092","They'll behave
exactly as I tell them to."
771,"00:59:54,094","00:59:56,794",The perfect soldier.
772,"00:59:56,796","00:59:58,363",Put them on the platform.
773,"00:59:58,365","01:00:01,034",It is time to think big.
774,"01:00:08,741","01:00:10,742",Are you sure about this?
775,"01:00:10,744","01:00:12,145","She has to protect
the realms."
776,"01:00:20,921","01:00:23,688","Ready, steady, go!"
777,"01:00:38,139","01:00:40,208","Hello, boys!"
778,"01:00:43,411","01:00:44,742",They're huge!
779,"01:00:44,744","01:00:46,980",I know. Isn't it magnificent?
780,"01:00:47,448","01:00:48,982",Soldiers...
781,"01:00:50,083","01:00:51,218",attention!
782,"01:00:54,921","01:00:56,089",Report!
783,"01:01:02,730","01:01:05,131","Prepare to march
on the Fourth Realm."
784,"01:01:05,133","01:01:06,332",March on the...
785,"01:01:06,334","01:01:08,467","I thought this army
was to defend us."
786,"01:01:08,469","01:01:11,303","Well, attack is the best
form of defense, my dear."
787,"01:01:11,305","01:01:12,972","My mother wouldn't
have wanted this."
788,"01:01:12,974","01:01:14,806","I don't care
what your mother wanted."
789,"01:01:14,808","01:01:15,977",She's not here.
790,"01:01:17,178","01:01:18,310",I...
791,"01:01:18,312","01:01:20,312",I order you to stop.
792,"01:01:20,314","01:01:23,816",You order me?
793,"01:01:23,818","01:01:24,950","Well, well, well."
794,"01:01:24,952","01:01:27,155","Finally ready to play queen,
are we?"
795,"01:01:28,290","01:01:30,390",Too late.
796,"01:01:30,392","01:01:32,191","I only needed you
to bring me the key,"
797,"01:01:32,193","01:01:33,460",and now that I have it...
798,"01:01:33,462","01:01:35,995",I have no more use for you.
799,"01:01:35,997","01:01:37,730",Seize them!
800,"01:01:37,732","01:01:38,998",Take your hands off her!
801,"01:01:39,000","01:01:40,933","Oh,
they won't listen to you."
802,"01:01:40,935","01:01:42,301",I gave them life...
803,"01:01:42,303","01:01:44,170",so they'll only listen to me.
804,"01:01:44,172","01:01:45,505",Traitor!
805,"01:01:45,507","01:01:48,108",Why are you doing this?
806,"01:01:48,110","01:01:51,844",Your mother abandoned us.
807,"01:01:51,846","01:01:53,280",And then...
808,"01:01:53,282","01:01:56,049","she just expects us to
carry on and play nice."
809,"01:01:56,051","01:01:58,287","Well, I don't want
to play nice!"
810,"01:01:59,754","01:02:03,256","Mother Ginger didn't do
anything wrong, did she?"
811,"01:02:03,258","01:02:05,425",You lied to me.
812,"01:02:05,427","01:02:07,092",To everyone.
813,"01:02:07,094","01:02:11,031","But I have a very special plan
for Mother Ginger..."
814,"01:02:11,033","01:02:13,001",and the other regents.
815,"01:02:13,436","01:02:14,868",Watch.
816,"01:02:14,870","01:02:17,237","Oh, Guard..."
817,"01:02:17,239","01:02:20,008","will you stand
over there, please?"
818,"01:02:21,944","01:02:24,177","Yes, just right
in the center."
819,"01:02:34,057","01:02:35,189",You see...
820,"01:02:35,191","01:02:36,524",there's a funny little perk...
821,"01:02:36,526","01:02:39,093",to your mother's invention.
822,"01:02:39,095","01:02:41,264",It works both ways.
823,"01:02:42,198","01:02:43,797",You are horrible.
824,"01:02:43,799","01:02:46,068","How dare you speak
to your queen that way!"
825,"01:02:46,502","01:02:48,136",Guards!
826,"01:02:49,338","01:02:51,006",Lock them up.
827,"01:03:41,057","01:03:42,058",There's no way to escape.
828,"01:03:44,928","01:03:46,128","Get your hands
off of me! Don't touch me!"
829,"01:03:46,130","01:03:47,562","- Hands off!
- How dare you!"
830,"01:03:47,564","01:03:49,164","I've never been
treated like this..."
831,"01:03:49,166","01:03:50,299",in all my life.
832,"01:03:50,301","01:03:52,301","Get off! Oh, my God!"
833,"01:03:52,303","01:03:54,869",Alas...
834,"01:03:54,871","01:03:56,238","you're here as well,
my dear."
835,"01:03:56,240","01:03:57,639",What's happening?
836,"01:03:57,641","01:03:59,341",What's Sugar Plum doing?
837,"01:03:59,343","01:04:01,909","Why are we
locked up here?"
838,"01:04:01,911","01:04:03,612",It's all my fault.
839,"01:04:03,614","01:04:05,079",I've let you all down.
840,"01:04:05,081","01:04:06,981",No. No.
841,"01:04:06,983","01:04:08,617","Clara, that's not true."
842,"01:04:08,619","01:04:10,285",Sugar Plum lied to us.
843,"01:04:10,287","01:04:12,220",But I gave her the key...
844,"01:04:12,222","01:04:14,323","and now she's going to use it
to destroy the realms..."
845,"01:04:14,325","01:04:16,024","and everything
that my mother loved."
846,"01:04:16,026","01:04:18,160","- Clara, listen to me.
- No!"
847,"01:04:18,162","01:04:19,961",I wanted to go home...
848,"01:04:19,963","01:04:21,563",but you stopped me...
849,"01:04:21,565","01:04:23,434","and now
I've ruined everything."
850,"01:04:36,481","01:04:38,216",This is more like it.
851,"01:04:39,083","01:04:40,583",A proper army.
852,"01:04:40,585","01:04:42,117",To create discipline...
853,"01:04:42,119","01:04:44,088","order, control."
854,"01:04:45,423","01:04:47,623",Boys in uniform with weapons.
855,"01:04:47,625","01:04:49,627","Sends a quiver
right through me."
856,"01:05:36,975","01:05:40,311","""Everything you need
is inside."""
857,"01:05:47,420","01:05:49,121",It's me.
858,"01:05:54,226","01:05:55,561",Captain.
859,"01:05:57,696","01:05:59,563",I'm sorry for blaming you.
860,"01:05:59,565","01:06:01,600","This is all my fault,
and I'm going to fix it."
861,"01:06:03,368","01:06:05,134",Will you help me?
862,"01:06:07,071","01:06:08,406",Please?
863,"01:06:10,209","01:06:12,276",Of course I will.
864,"01:06:12,278","01:06:13,345",Nutcrackers are very loyal.
865,"01:06:14,246","01:06:16,015",You are indeed.
866,"01:06:18,117","01:06:19,218",Are you ready?
867,"01:06:20,019","01:06:21,187",Ready.
868,"01:06:21,754","01:06:23,155",Go!
869,"01:06:30,095","01:06:31,095",I'm sorry.
870,"01:06:36,068","01:06:37,069",A little more.
871,"01:06:38,805","01:06:41,338",A bit more.
872,"01:06:41,340","01:06:43,641","My dear, that doesn't
look very secure."
873,"01:06:43,643","01:06:45,175",You can't.
874,"01:06:45,177","01:06:47,110",It's not gonna work.
875,"01:06:47,112","01:06:49,213",It's just the laws of physics.
876,"01:06:49,215","01:06:51,114",Do those laws always work?
877,"01:06:51,116","01:06:52,418",Always.
878,"01:06:55,287","01:06:57,090",As far as I know.
879,"01:06:59,159","01:07:00,658",Ready.
880,"01:07:00,660","01:07:02,028",Ready.
881,"01:07:04,798","01:07:05,966",Go!
882,"01:07:08,401","01:07:09,669",Whoa!
883,"01:07:15,408","01:07:16,676",Clara.
884,"01:07:22,517","01:07:23,582",That's more like it.
885,"01:07:23,584","01:07:24,717",There she is.
886,"01:07:24,719","01:07:26,150",Out with the old...
887,"01:07:26,152","01:07:27,385",in with the new.
888,"01:07:27,387","01:07:29,356",Gather at the gate.
889,"01:07:30,223","01:07:32,158",Wait for my command.
890,"01:07:34,160","01:07:36,162","Jog on, boys."
891,"01:07:39,232","01:07:40,534",She's going.
892,"01:07:44,805","01:07:47,740","I have to get to the
Engine Room and stop this."
893,"01:07:53,447","01:07:54,780",We can't get in this way.
894,"01:07:56,617","01:07:58,084",Mouserinks.
895,"01:07:58,886","01:08:01,620","- Get out of here!
- Wait!"
896,"01:08:01,622","01:08:03,421","I think he's trying
to tell us something."
897,"01:08:05,492","01:08:06,661",Quickly.
898,"01:08:41,563","01:08:43,295","Thank you
for your help."
899,"01:08:44,432","01:08:46,599","Can you get us
to the Engine Room?"
900,"01:08:46,601","01:08:48,534","Are you sure
we can trust him?"
901,"01:08:50,438","01:08:51,570","Don't start with me,
mouse!"
902,"01:08:51,572","01:08:53,339","All right, stop!"
903,"01:08:53,341","01:08:54,908",We don't have much time.
904,"01:08:54,910","01:08:56,643",We need to work together.
905,"01:08:58,714","01:08:59,781",Show us.
906,"01:09:17,733","01:09:19,266",Where'd he go?
907,"01:09:20,703","01:09:22,170",This way!
908,"01:09:43,225","01:09:44,324","We should be able
to ride the wheels"
909,"01:09:44,326","01:09:45,626",up to the Engine Room.
910,"01:09:45,628","01:09:46,894",All right...
911,"01:09:46,896","01:09:48,763","- I'll go first.
- No!"
912,"01:09:48,765","01:09:50,364","You have to warn
Mother Ginger."
913,"01:09:50,366","01:09:52,232","Those soldiers will be heading
to the Fourth Realm."
914,"01:09:52,234","01:09:53,934","What? I'm not going
to leave you, Clara."
915,"01:09:53,936","01:09:55,903",I can handle this.
916,"01:09:55,905","01:09:57,439",You have to trust me. Please.
917,"01:09:58,440","01:09:59,676",I do.
918,"01:10:02,779","01:10:04,644","Can you take the captain
to Mother Ginger?"
919,"01:10:10,553","01:10:11,953",Thank you.
920,"01:10:13,890","01:10:15,489",Be careful.
921,"01:10:15,491","01:10:17,460","That's an order, Captain."
922,"01:10:36,046","01:10:39,413","Thank you, Captain."
923,"01:10:39,415","01:10:41,652","Please, Clara,
call me Phillip."
924,"01:10:42,518","01:10:43,887","Thank you, Phillip."
925,"01:10:52,930","01:10:54,495","Let's go, mouse."
926,"01:10:54,497","01:10:55,863",Lead the way.
927,"01:10:58,969","01:11:00,769",I don't speak rodent.
928,"01:11:51,589","01:11:52,590",Mother Ginger!
929,"01:11:55,492","01:11:56,527",Oh.
930,"01:12:07,571","01:12:09,072",Wait!
931,"01:12:09,074","01:12:10,974",I come as a friend.
932,"01:12:10,976","01:12:12,508",Look.
933,"01:12:15,380","01:12:17,081",Let him through!
934,"01:12:22,053","01:12:24,053","- Where's Clara?
- In the palace."
935,"01:12:24,055","01:12:26,455","But she has a plan.
Please, Mother Ginger."
936,"01:12:26,457","01:12:28,691","Sugar Plum has built an army
to conquer all the realms."
937,"01:12:28,693","01:12:29,994",They're coming for you.
938,"01:12:31,428","01:12:34,631","Sugar Plum thinks
she's divided us all."
939,"01:12:34,633","01:12:37,768","But a long time ago we both
took an oath to our queen..."
940,"01:12:37,770","01:12:39,870","to defend the realms
no matter the cost."
941,"01:12:41,841","01:12:44,842","Are you still willing
to uphold that oath?"
942,"01:12:44,844","01:12:46,811","No matter the cost,
I'm ready."
943,"01:12:47,679","01:12:49,614",Brave nutcracker.
944,"01:12:50,548","01:12:52,149",So now...
945,"01:12:52,151","01:12:55,120","we must draw
Sugar Plum to us."
946,"01:14:28,882","01:14:31,015","Forget those
ludicrous clowns!"
947,"01:14:31,017","01:14:33,518",I want Mother Ginger!
948,"01:15:54,702","01:15:57,237",Victory is ours!
949,"01:15:57,239","01:15:59,272","Come out, Mother Ginger!"
950,"01:16:06,148","01:16:07,946",The nutcracker?
951,"01:16:07,948","01:16:09,649","Were you expecting
someone else?"
952,"01:16:09,651","01:16:11,184",Where is she?
953,"01:16:13,789","01:16:15,991",Oh!
954,"01:16:16,658","01:16:17,891",Mother Ginger!
955,"01:16:17,893","01:16:19,392","At your service,
Your Majesty!"
956,"01:16:19,394","01:16:20,595",Duck!
957,"01:16:24,666","01:16:25,901",Destroy him!
958,"01:16:26,968","01:16:29,071","You heard her.
Come and get me."
959,"01:16:34,043","01:16:36,010",I can disable the Engine.
960,"01:16:36,012","01:16:37,712","Go! I'll take care
of this lot."
961,"01:17:05,741","01:17:07,777","No matter the cost.
I'm ready."
962,"01:17:12,215","01:17:13,447",Mouserinks.
963,"01:17:16,152","01:17:18,018","Come on, you tin cans."
964,"01:17:18,020","01:17:19,255",Let's settle this like men.
965,"01:17:31,200","01:17:32,869","Clara! Please, hurry!"
966,"01:17:53,390","01:17:56,491","Mother Ginger,
I'm just so pleased..."
967,"01:17:56,493","01:17:58,994",you decided to drop in.
968,"01:18:01,030","01:18:02,164",Mouserinks...
969,"01:18:02,166","01:18:03,731",don't let them split us up.
970,"01:18:03,733","01:18:04,901",Stay with me.
971,"01:18:33,231","01:18:37,033","You just had to interfere
again, didn't you?"
972,"01:18:37,035","01:18:39,302","I stopped you once before,
remember?"
973,"01:18:39,304","01:18:41,836","You merely delayed
the inevitable."
974,"01:18:42,940","01:18:45,241",The princess...
975,"01:18:45,243","01:18:46,942",where is she?
976,"01:18:46,944","01:18:48,277",She's gone!
977,"01:18:48,279","01:18:50,879","She's fled the realm.
She's safe from you!"
978,"01:18:50,881","01:18:54,849","Then I'm the queen
of the castle..."
979,"01:18:54,851","01:18:59,255",and you're a dirty rascal.
980,"01:18:59,257","01:19:01,726","This is madness, Sugar Plum!
It has to stop!"
981,"01:19:02,360","01:19:04,360",Put her on the platform.
982,"01:19:04,362","01:19:05,928",Sugar Plum...
983,"01:19:05,930","01:19:07,764",I know you miss Marie.
984,"01:19:08,433","01:19:10,299",We all do.
985,"01:19:10,301","01:19:12,901","But this isn't gonna
make you feel any better!"
986,"01:19:12,903","01:19:14,570","Banishing you
to the Fourth Realm..."
987,"01:19:14,572","01:19:17,039",made me feel just...
988,"01:19:17,041","01:19:18,174",delicious.
989,"01:19:18,176","01:19:19,275",But this...
990,"01:19:21,112","01:19:23,946",this is going to be...
991,"01:19:23,948","01:19:26,518",exquisite.
992,"01:19:27,252","01:19:28,485",Adieu.
993,"01:19:28,487","01:19:29,488",Farewell.
994,"01:19:30,355","01:19:31,821",Goodbye.
995,"01:19:31,823","01:19:33,322","Sugar Plum, stop!"
996,"01:19:33,324","01:19:35,925","Clara, run!
Get out of here!"
997,"01:19:35,927","01:19:37,262",Seize her!
998,"01:19:41,199","01:19:43,099","For the princess,
my friend..."
999,"01:19:43,101","01:19:44,268",and the realms.
1000,"01:19:48,240","01:19:50,040",Don't do this.
1001,"01:19:50,042","01:19:52,242",My mother loved you.
1002,"01:19:52,244","01:19:54,378","You had a special place
in her heart."
1003,"01:19:54,380","01:19:57,581","You, of all people,
should understand, Clara."
1004,"01:19:57,583","01:19:59,349","She left you alone, too."
1005,"01:19:59,351","01:20:00,352",No.
1006,"01:20:01,320","01:20:04,122",She left me everything I need.
1007,"01:20:06,090","01:20:07,557",I'm not alone.
1008,"01:20:07,559","01:20:10,262","Sugar Plum,
we are not alone."
1009,"01:20:11,397","01:20:13,065",You're right.
1010,"01:20:15,100","01:20:19,104","I have a big, beautiful army
to protect me."
1011,"01:20:22,141","01:20:24,641","No one will hurt me
ever again."
1012,"01:20:24,643","01:20:26,512",I know you're angry.
1013,"01:20:27,579","01:20:30,213","But you can still do
the right thing."
1014,"01:20:30,215","01:20:32,116","Sugar Plum, listen to her."
1015,"01:20:32,118","01:20:34,387","This isn't what
Marie wanted for us."
1016,"01:20:35,055","01:20:36,354",For us?
1017,"01:20:36,356","01:20:40,291","A true queen does
what's best for herself."
1018,"01:20:44,431","01:20:45,463",No.
1019,"01:20:45,465","01:20:49,600","A true queen does
what's best for her people."
1020,"01:20:53,939","01:20:55,673","And you were right,
Sugar Plum."
1021,"01:20:55,675","01:20:59,045","I am every inch
my mother's daughter."
1022,"01:21:03,116","01:21:05,352","Clara, what have you done?"
1023,"01:21:26,306","01:21:27,874",She did it.
1024,"01:21:33,380","01:21:34,713",Let me go.
1025,"01:21:39,586","01:21:40,887",Mouserinks.
1026,"01:21:42,489","01:21:43,956",Clara did it.
1027,"01:21:47,428","01:21:49,196",Mother Ginger?
1028,"01:21:52,733","01:21:55,068","Well done, Clara."
1029,"01:22:39,213","01:22:42,247","Clara, it's over.
We are saved."
1030,"01:22:42,249","01:22:45,552","Peace is restored.
The realms are reunited."
1031,"01:22:45,554","01:22:49,556","And it's all because of you,
my dear."
1032,"01:22:49,558","01:22:50,757","This all could have
been avoided"
1033,"01:22:50,759","01:22:52,625","if only I listened to you,
Mother Ginger."
1034,"01:22:52,627","01:22:55,127","Oh, it's not your fault."
1035,"01:22:55,129","01:22:56,731",No one else did either.
1036,"01:22:58,433","01:23:01,434","Your mother would be very
proud of you, my dear."
1037,"01:23:01,436","01:23:03,071",Very proud.
1038,"01:23:04,406","01:23:07,273","Captain Nutcracker,
would you escort Clara"
1039,"01:23:07,275","01:23:08,508","to the Christmas
Tree Forest..."
1040,"01:23:08,510","01:23:10,743","and then return
in your new post"
1041,"01:23:10,745","01:23:12,347",as Captain of the Guard.
1042,"01:23:15,684","01:23:17,249",What about your bridge?
1043,"01:23:17,251","01:23:19,117",I'm afraid I'd be lonely.
1044,"01:23:19,119","01:23:20,788","I suppose I have you
to thank for that."
1045,"01:23:20,790","01:23:22,456",I suppose you do.
1046,"01:23:22,458","01:23:24,758","And besides, I have
a new friend now."
1047,"01:23:52,822","01:23:53,888",Your Majesty.
1048,"01:23:53,890","01:23:58,126","Your Highness. And brave
Captain Nutcracker."
1049,"01:24:00,128","01:24:02,763","It is an honor to serve
at your post, sir."
1050,"01:24:02,765","01:24:04,767","Keep up the good work, men."
1051,"01:24:10,741","01:24:13,674","On three.
One, two, three."
1052,"01:24:19,782","01:24:21,582",You've really put on weight.
1053,"01:24:36,667","01:24:38,533","Please come back
to the realms one day."
1054,"01:24:38,535","01:24:41,302","Oh, of course I will."
1055,"01:24:41,304","01:24:43,470","Or maybe one day,
you could come to my world."
1056,"01:24:43,472","01:24:45,539",You can meet my family.
1057,"01:24:45,541","01:24:46,808",Are they like you?
1058,"01:24:47,911","01:24:49,545","Well, they're a bit different."
1059,"01:24:52,481","01:24:54,481",I'm going to miss you.
1060,"01:24:54,483","01:24:55,619",I'll miss you too.
1061,"01:24:57,321","01:25:00,557","But when you miss someone,
you remember them."
1062,"01:25:02,526","01:25:04,526",Are you sure?
1063,"01:25:04,528","01:25:07,197","And one day
that'll make you smile."
1064,"01:25:09,633","01:25:11,401",I promise you.
1065,"01:25:14,605","01:25:15,606","Goodbye, Clara."
1066,"01:25:17,306","01:25:18,575",Goodbye.
1067,"01:25:52,644","01:25:53,811",Clara?
1068,"01:25:55,380","01:25:56,712",There you are.
1069,"01:25:56,714","01:25:57,947",Back so soon?
1070,"01:25:57,949","01:25:59,414",Thank you.
1071,"01:25:59,416","01:26:01,584",Ah.
1072,"01:26:01,586","01:26:03,585",Pin tumbler locks.
1073,"01:26:03,587","01:26:05,955","Devilish things
to get into, aren't they?"
1074,"01:26:05,957","01:26:09,960","I worked it out.
Eventually."
1075,"01:26:09,962","01:26:12,563",Hmm. I knew you would.
1076,"01:26:14,365","01:26:16,632",Clara...
1077,"01:26:16,634","01:26:21,606","your mother was the cleverest
inventor I ever knew."
1078,"01:26:23,274","01:26:25,574","And there was
never any doubt"
1079,"01:26:25,576","01:26:28,613","when I asked what
her greatest creation was."
1080,"01:26:31,617","01:26:33,217",It was you.
1081,"01:26:51,836","01:26:53,536",Clara.
1082,"01:26:53,538","01:26:56,608","Father, I'm so sorry."
1083,"01:27:01,714","01:27:02,881",I'm sorry.
1084,"01:27:06,752","01:27:08,420",I'm sorry.
1085,"01:27:09,488","01:27:12,288","This time has been
extremely difficult..."
1086,"01:27:12,290","01:27:13,759",for all of us.
1087,"01:27:16,495","01:27:21,000","I lost the love of my life,
and you lost your mother."
1088,"01:27:22,434","01:27:26,238","And I will miss her
every day of my life."
1089,"01:27:29,075","01:27:32,910","But I don't want to miss
one more minute..."
1090,"01:27:32,912","01:27:35,781","with you, or Louise,
or Fritz."
1091,"01:27:48,762","01:27:50,295",Shall we go home?
1092,"01:27:51,498","01:27:52,966","Don't you owe me
a dance first?"
1093,"01:27:54,333","01:27:57,904","After all, it's what's
expected of us."
1094,"01:27:58,872","01:28:00,774",I suppose I do.
1095,"01:28:02,608","01:28:04,008","Ah, you've opened it."
1096,"01:28:04,010","01:28:05,912",Wasn't so hard after all.
1097,"01:28:18,758","01:28:19,759",What is it?
1098,"01:28:21,528","01:28:23,361","This is the very song
that your mother and I"
1099,"01:28:23,363","01:28:24,764",first danced to.
1100,"01:28:44,051","01:28:45,383",May we join you?
1101,"01:28:45,385","01:28:46,653",I want to dance.
1102,"01:28:47,687","01:28:48,855",Please do.
