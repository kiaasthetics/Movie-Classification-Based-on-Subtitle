Floyd."
26,"00:02:10,589","00:02:12,132","It's the first show
of the tour."
27,"00:02:12,216","00:02:14,510","We have to hit
the perfect family harmony."

33,"00:02:22,976","00:02:24,144","He's not allowed
to be nervous."

35,"00:02:25,479","00:02:28,023","Cut him some slack, John Dory.
It's his first show."

37,"00:02:30,275","00:02:31,860","Hey, Branch. How you feeling?"
38,"00:02:31,944","00:02:35,239","I feel like I'm gonna barf
and pass out and--"
39,"00:02:35,322","00:02:36,406",Pee your pants all at once?
40,"00:02:36,490","00:02:37,574",How'd you know?
41,"00:02:37,658","00:02:39,034","Ah,
you got the pre-show jitters."
42,"00:02:39,117","00:02:40,118",Completely normal.
43,"00:02:40,202","00:02:43,247","Everyone gets 'em. You wanna
know what I do when I get 'em?"
44,"00:02:44,289","00:02:46,083","Barf, pass out
and pee your pants?"
45,"00:02:46,166","00:02:48,126","I remember
that I'm with my brothers,"
46,"00:02:48,210","00:02:49,670","and that
when we come together,"
47,"00:02:49,753","00:02:51,713","there is nothing
that we can't do."
48,"00:02:51,797","00:02:54,883","But no one's ever hit the
perfect family harmony before."
49,"00:02:54,967","00:02:57,594","Is it true
it can shatter diamonds?"
50,"00:02:57,678","00:02:59,513",Yeah. It's that powerful.
51,"00:02:59,596","00:03:00,597","All right,
boys, just remember,"
52,"00:03:00,681","00:03:02,933","no matter what you do,
follow my lead."
53,"00:03:03,016","00:03:04,101","Or maybe,"
54,"00:03:04,184","00:03:05,853","let's just go out there
and have fun together."
55,"00:03:05,936","00:03:08,522",It's just so much pressure.
56,"00:03:08,605","00:03:09,648",Ten seconds!
57,"00:03:09,731","00:03:12,109","A-And what happens
if we can't hit it?"
58,"00:03:12,192","00:03:13,318","Oh, that's not an option."
59,"00:03:13,402","00:03:14,945","If we can't hit
the perfect family harmony,"
60,"00:03:15,028","00:03:16,196",we aren't perfect.
61,"00:03:16,280","00:03:18,574","And if we aren't perfect,
we're nothing."
62,"00:03:18,657","00:03:21,118","Just follow my lead,
and the harmony will happen."
63,"00:03:22,244","00:03:23,412",Let's bro!

128,"00:06:10,495","00:06:13,207","It's my fault.
I ruined everything."
129,"00:06:13,290","00:06:15,709","N-No, no. Branch,
this is not your fault."
130,"00:06:15,792","00:06:17,169",We're not in sync.
131,"00:06:17,252","00:06:18,670","We've gone from boys to men,"

I'll be back. I promise."
137,"00:06:28,805","00:06:30,015","But right now, I--"
138,"00:06:30,724","00:06:32,184",I have to follow my heart.
139,"00:06:32,267","00:06:34,645","It's telling me that it's time
to start a solo career."
140,"00:06:34,728","00:06:37,523",But what am I gonna do?
141,"00:06:37,606","00:06:40,984","Branch, you are gonna do the
most important thing of all."
142,"00:06:41,610","00:06:42,611",You're gonna…
143,"00:06:43,403","00:06:45,030",take care of Grandma.
144,"00:06:45,113","00:06:48,784","Oh, come on, Branch.
Let's play some rummy."
145,"00:06:48,867","00:06:50,244","But I won't let you win,"
146,"00:06:50,786","00:06:52,913",because I play for the money.
147,"00:06:53,914","00:06:55,582",You might have to let her win.
148,"00:06:55,666","00:06:56,583",Occasionally.
149,"00:06:58,335","00:06:59,378","When you miss me,"
150,"00:06:59,461","00:07:00,796",you can wear this.
151,"00:07:02,005","00:07:03,966","It'll be like
I'm right here with you."
152,"00:07:04,633","00:07:06,051","And when you come back,"
153,"00:07:06,134","00:07:07,302",we'll make our hideout.

You're more like a trunk."
316,"00:14:22,571","00:14:23,655",Junk in the trunk.
317,"00:14:23,739","00:14:24,907",Ow!

You put my boyfriend down."

and what you want."
324,"00:14:37,002","00:14:39,838","-Ow.
-Hey. What up?"
325,"00:14:39,922","00:14:41,465","You're right.
Totally rude of me."
326,"00:14:41,548","00:14:42,841",Didn't introduce myself.
327,"00:14:42,925","00:14:45,052",I'm Branch's brother.

to me and be real?"
334,"00:15:00,567","00:15:01,401",Well--
335,"00:15:01,485","00:15:02,569","You could've started

337,"00:15:03,820","00:15:06,198","-Former brother.

339,"00:15:07,491","00:15:11,328","Huh? What would I know
about secret family members?"
340,"00:15:13,372","00:15:15,040","Oh, my gosh.
I was being so rude."
341,"00:15:15,123","00:15:16,834","I've never met anyone
from Branch's family before."
342,"00:15:16,917","00:15:18,043","I'm Poppy,
Branch's girlfriend."
343,"00:15:18,126","00:15:20,003","Should we hug, fist-bump,
smile and wave for now"
344,"00:15:20,087","00:15:21,463","and see where
the night takes us?"
345,"00:15:21,547","00:15:22,840",All of the above.
346,"00:15:22,923","00:15:24,007","Wait, I know you."
347,"00:15:24,091","00:15:25,676",You're the guy from BroZone!

to them."
349,"00:15:27,469","00:15:28,637","Yeah, BroZone!"
350,"00:15:28,720","00:15:30,389","Wait. Wait, wait, wait.

you're not the heartthrob."

353,"00:15:33,141","00:15:34,434","The fun one?
No, you're kind of uptight."
354,"00:15:34,518","00:15:35,477",Uptight?
355,"00:15:35,561","00:15:36,937","Hmm.
Not the sensitive one either."
356,"00:15:37,020","00:15:38,272","Okay, a lot of assumptions"
357,"00:15:38,355","00:15:40,023","for someone
you just met 30 seconds ago--"
358,"00:15:40,107","00:15:42,359","Oh, oh! I've got it.
You're John Dory."
359,"00:15:42,442","00:15:43,735","-The leader.
-The old one!"
360,"00:15:45,153","00:15:47,823","Uh, sorry to interrupt, but we
lose the venue at 11:00, so--"
361,"00:15:47,906","00:15:50,075","Shh, I'm trying to listen.
Very hot gossip."
362,"00:15:50,158","00:15:53,996","So, if-- if you're
Branch's bro, then that means"
363,"00:15:54,079","00:15:55,664","that all the other
BroZone bros"
364,"00:15:55,747","00:15:57,666",are Branch's bros too.
365,"00:15:57,749","00:16:00,836","Branch,
how come you never told me?"
366,"00:16:00,919","00:16:02,212",Because it's complicated.
367,"00:16:02,296","00:16:03,505","Oh, sweetie."
368,"00:16:03,589","00:16:06,091","'Cause you weren't
in the band."
369,"00:16:06,175","00:16:07,885","Branch was in the band
all right."
370,"00:16:07,968","00:16:09,761","What? No way.
Which one was he?"
371,"00:16:09,845","00:16:11,722","-Bitty B.
-Bitty B?"
372,"00:16:11,805","00:16:13,015","No, that's impossible."
373,"00:16:13,098","00:16:14,933","-Bitty B had glasses.
-Oh, and a diaper."
374,"00:16:15,017","00:16:19,104",And a falsetto made of gold.
375,"00:16:19,188","00:16:20,355",Not that anyone cared.
376,"00:16:20,439","00:16:21,690",But that's all in the past.
377,"00:16:21,773","00:16:23,358","Because they stopped
being my brothers"
378,"00:16:23,442","00:16:26,069","the day they walked out on me
and never came back."
379,"00:16:26,153","00:16:27,988","Whoa, whoa, whoa.
That's not fair, Branch."
380,"00:16:28,071","00:16:29,948","I did come back,
but no one was there."
381,"00:16:30,032","00:16:31,909","It wasn't until I heard about
you saving the world"
382,"00:16:31,992","00:16:33,327",from the rock apocalypse
383,"00:16:33,410","00:16:35,329","that I realized
you were even still alive."
384,"00:16:35,412","00:16:36,914","Oh, that's-- That's so sweet."
385,"00:16:36,997","00:16:38,373",He realized I was still alive.
386,"00:16:38,457","00:16:39,583",Twenty years too late!
387,"00:16:39,666","00:16:41,835","Hi. Sorry. He gets hangry
if he skips breakfast."
388,"00:16:41,919","00:16:43,587",I had breakfast.
389,"00:16:43,670","00:16:45,631","It was avocado toast
with two poached eggs,"
390,"00:16:45,714","00:16:47,049","some cayenne
for a little kick."
391,"00:16:47,132","00:16:48,550","And you know what?
It was delightful."
392,"00:16:48,634","00:16:50,260","Branch,
what's going on with you?"
393,"00:16:50,344","00:16:51,929","The question
we should be asking is,"
394,"00:16:52,012","00:16:53,472",what's going on with him?
395,"00:16:53,555","00:16:55,599","I bet you he's only here
because he needs something."
396,"00:16:55,682","00:16:57,518","That's not true.
He's your brother."
397,"00:16:57,601","00:16:59,520","Branch, I'm gonna be straight
with you. I need something."
398,"00:16:59,603","00:17:00,687",And there it is.
399,"00:17:00,771","00:17:02,189","Come on, man. I'm trying here."
400,"00:17:02,272","00:17:03,440","Wait-- Wait. Hold up, Branch."
401,"00:17:04,148","00:17:05,192",It's about Floyd.
402,"00:17:05,858","00:17:06,944",What do you mean?
403,"00:17:07,027","00:17:08,362","He's in danger, man."
404,"00:17:11,073","00:17:13,407","I hadn't heard from him
since the band broke up."
405,"00:17:17,079","00:17:18,497",-Until…
406,"00:17:21,165","00:17:22,835",I got a letter from him.

-Oh, yeah."
458,"00:20:06,748","00:20:07,958","So we can attempt to sing
something"
459,"00:20:08,041","00:20:09,042",we've only tried once
460,"00:20:09,126","00:20:11,170","and failed so miserably at
that we broke up"
461,"00:20:11,253","00:20:12,629","and never talked
to each other again."
462,"00:20:12,713","00:20:15,549","-We are so in.
-What? Uh…"
463,"00:20:15,632","00:20:17,885",Could you give us a second?
464,"00:20:17,968","00:20:18,927",Huh?
465,"00:20:19,011","00:20:21,305","Okay, what are you doing?"
466,"00:20:21,388","00:20:23,599","This is your second chance
with your brothers, Branch."
467,"00:20:23,682","00:20:26,143","It's not that easy, okay?"
468,"00:20:26,226","00:20:28,061","You don't get it.
You don't have any siblings."
469,"00:20:28,145","00:20:29,229",That's my point.
470,"00:20:29,313","00:20:32,357","Branch, you are so lucky to
have a brother to fight for."
471,"00:20:32,441","00:20:34,193","I mean, if I had a sister…"
472,"00:20:34,276","00:20:35,360",…it would be so perfect.
473,"00:20:35,444","00:20:37,112","We'd be best friends and
we'd teach each other things."
474,"00:20:37,196","00:20:38,655","We'd never fight,
we'd have each other's backs."
475,"00:20:38,739","00:20:40,365","We wouldn't talk 'cause we'd
think the same thoughts."
476,"00:20:40,449","00:20:41,617","Everyone would ask us
if we're twins,"
477,"00:20:41,700","00:20:43,785","and we'd be like,
""Well, not technically""--"
478,"00:20:43,869","00:20:45,495","-Poppy.
-But…"
479,"00:20:46,496","00:20:48,457","if she were ever in trouble,"
480,"00:20:48,540","00:20:51,043","I would do everything I could
to help her."
481,"00:20:51,126","00:20:52,711",I would show up.
482,"00:20:52,794","00:20:54,588","Okay, listen."
483,"00:20:54,671","00:20:57,591","If there was a brother
that I might do this for,"
484,"00:20:57,674","00:20:59,092","and I'm not saying there is,"
485,"00:21:00,177","00:21:01,136",it would be Floyd.
486,"00:21:01,220","00:21:02,721","I'm not hearing ""no."""
487,"00:21:02,804","00:21:04,389","-Yes! Works for me.

499,"00:21:32,668","00:21:35,420","-Um, I guess she likes me?
-Yeah, she does."
500,"00:21:35,504","00:21:37,506",Or she's marking you as prey.
501,"00:21:37,589","00:21:39,341","Can never quite tell
with Rhonda."

563,"00:24:13,120","00:24:14,246",but that is it!
564,"00:24:14,329","00:24:15,664","Oh, really? You don't wanna?"
565,"00:24:15,747","00:24:16,999","Okay, that's fine."
566,"00:24:17,082","00:24:18,458","We'll just
kiss our careers goodbye"
567,"00:24:18,542","00:24:20,544","and focus our efforts
on charity."
568,"00:24:20,627","00:24:21,795",Good one.
569,"00:24:33,599","00:24:35,767",That's more like it.
570,"00:24:35,851","00:24:38,770","We're so close to having
everything we always knew"
571,"00:24:38,854","00:24:41,398","we believed we deserved
to have!"
572,"00:24:41,481","00:24:43,650","Veneer, what's with your vibe
and your face?"
573,"00:24:43,734","00:24:45,402","Why do you have
resting-moody-vibe face?"
574,"00:24:45,485","00:24:47,196","No, I know we've deserved
to be famous"
575,"00:24:47,279","00:24:48,572",just 'cause we want to.
576,"00:24:48,655","00:24:51,408","But honestly,
that dude looks rough."
577,"00:24:51,491","00:24:53,577","-He's fine.
-And he's getting pale."
578,"00:24:53,660","00:24:56,496","And not in like a stunning,
Victorian way."
579,"00:24:57,331","00:24:59,708","Don't you see
what you're doing?"
580,"00:24:59,791","00:25:01,627","You're literally sucking
the life out of me."
581,"00:25:01,710","00:25:03,545","That's what
I tell Crimp every day."
582,"00:25:04,796","00:25:05,964",What are we gonna do?
583,"00:25:06,048","00:25:07,216","We obviously can't rely
on this troll"
584,"00:25:07,299","00:25:09,009","to get us through
this dress rehearsal."
585,"00:25:09,092","00:25:10,552",Let alone the Rage Dome show.
586,"00:25:10,636","00:25:14,056","It's all going to change
as soon as we have BroZone."
587,"00:25:14,139","00:25:15,766","-BroZone?
-Yep!"
588,"00:25:15,849","00:25:19,228","I forged a letter begging
for them to come and save you."
589,"00:25:19,311","00:25:20,896",I love me.
590,"00:25:20,979","00:25:22,981","No!
You leave my brothers alone."
591,"00:25:23,065","00:25:26,109","Ugh.
I'm exhausted by this drama."
592,"00:25:26,193","00:25:27,653","Hey,
do you wanna go buy a yacht?"
593,"00:25:27,736","00:25:28,862","Oh, good idea."
594,"00:25:28,946","00:25:31,073",Let's buy matching yachts.

this random dude…"
608,"00:26:26,420","00:26:27,504",What?
609,"00:26:27,588","00:26:29,131",…on another musical adventure

612,"00:26:34,636","00:26:36,471","Well, Aunt Poppy,
for your information,"
613,"00:26:36,555","00:26:38,140",I am no longer a baby.
614,"00:26:38,223","00:26:39,975",I am a big boy now.
615,"00:26:40,058","00:26:42,603","And I'm on
a man-sized rite of passage"
616,"00:26:42,686","00:26:47,024","to learn lessons of life,
courage and maybe love."
617,"00:26:48,108","00:26:49,193",Aw.
618,"00:26:49,276","00:26:50,903","Should we be letting
a baby drive?"
619,"00:26:50,986","00:26:52,196","Not to worry, fellow grown-up."
620,"00:26:52,279","00:26:54,865","I have procured
my learner's permit."
621,"00:26:54,948","00:26:57,326",Who is Adulty McManface?
622,"00:26:57,409","00:27:00,329","The better question is,
are you a narc?"
623,"00:27:00,412","00:27:02,080",What? No. No.
624,"00:27:02,164","00:27:03,081",Why? Are you?
625,"00:27:04,333","00:27:06,502","Enough chitchat,
Adulty McManface. Step on it!"
626,"00:27:09,046","00:27:10,214","Okay, guys, where was I?"
627,"00:27:10,297","00:27:11,965","We gotta find our brothers
and fast."
628,"00:27:12,049","00:27:13,217",But don't worry.
629,"00:27:13,300","00:27:15,177",Old Branch's got it handled.
630,"00:27:15,260","00:27:17,346","All we have to do
is follow the clues."
631,"00:27:17,429","00:27:19,598","Wow.
Check out your old outfits."
632,"00:27:19,681","00:27:21,183",Puffy jackets.
633,"00:27:21,266","00:27:23,352","Puka shell necklaces.
Denim tuxedos?"
634,"00:27:23,435","00:27:26,772","Branch,
did you have frosted tips?"
635,"00:27:26,855","00:27:28,732",Yeah. It was an era.
636,"00:27:28,815","00:27:30,317",Don't forget his perm.
637,"00:27:30,901","00:27:33,028","No way!
Pictures or it didn't happen."
638,"00:27:33,570","00:27:36,907","Look at you!
You were so cute. I love it."
639,"00:27:38,784","00:27:40,202",But we had to pull the plug
640,"00:27:40,285","00:27:41,995","when he tried
to frost his perm."
641,"00:27:42,079","00:27:44,039","-It was an era!
-Tragic."
642,"00:27:44,122","00:27:46,083","While you two are
strolling down memory lane,"
643,"00:27:46,166","00:27:47,626",I'll work on finding Spruce.
644,"00:27:47,709","00:27:48,836","I'm gonna need copies
of that pic."
645,"00:27:48,919","00:27:49,753",Wallet size.
646,"00:27:49,837","00:27:51,171","Listen, baby brother,"
647,"00:27:51,255","00:27:53,423","we don't need your little
board to find Spruce…"
648,"00:27:53,507","00:27:55,676","-It's not little.
-…because I got this!"
649,"00:27:55,759","00:27:57,302",Ha! Booyah.
650,"00:27:57,386","00:27:59,972","A postcard that says,
""Wish you were here""?"
651,"00:28:00,055","00:28:01,640","That's it?
It's not even signed."
652,"00:28:01,723","00:28:03,225",It's definitely Spruce.
653,"00:28:03,308","00:28:06,186","I mean, he's the only one
I know who talks that way."
654,"00:28:06,270","00:28:08,856","There's no return address.
It's blank."
655,"00:28:08,939","00:28:10,232",This could be from anywhere.
656,"00:28:10,315","00:28:12,025","We can't find Spruce
with this."
657,"00:28:12,109","00:28:13,235","Yeah, we can!"
658,"00:28:13,318","00:28:15,279","All we have to do
is find this sunset."
659,"00:28:15,362","00:28:17,322","Liking that optimism,
Poppy seed."
660,"00:28:17,406","00:28:20,033","Branch, one word. Keeper!"
661,"00:28:20,117","00:28:23,036","Hey, man. I know about
being treated like a baby."
662,"00:28:23,120","00:28:25,038","But while it's just
the two of us,"
663,"00:28:25,122","00:28:26,790","-you want some of this?
-Nah."
664,"00:28:26,874","00:28:29,168","Thanks, man. I-I can't
get back on that train."
665,"00:28:29,251","00:28:30,335",Suit yourself.
666,"00:28:30,419","00:28:31,712","I mean, hey, look at this."
667,"00:28:31,795","00:28:33,839","We're never gonna
find Spruce with this."
668,"00:28:33,922","00:28:35,924","I bet this sunset
doesn't even exist."
669,"00:28:37,259","00:28:38,886","Oh, hot dog!"
670,"00:28:38,969","00:28:40,304","Oh, man."
671,"00:28:40,387","00:28:41,638",Of course.
672,"00:28:41,722","00:28:44,391","Hey, guys!
You're gonna want to see this."
673,"00:28:44,474","00:28:46,143",I knew we'd find it.
674,"00:28:46,226","00:28:47,728",Spruce must be on that island.
675,"00:28:47,811","00:28:49,354","Whoa, easy there, goggles."
676,"00:28:49,438","00:28:51,398","All right, y'all.
Let's mobilize!"
677,"00:28:51,481","00:28:53,025","Yeah, pedal to the metal, JD."
678,"00:28:56,486","00:28:58,614","-What are you doing?
-Worry not, friends."
679,"00:28:58,697","00:29:01,325","Rhonda here's
completely waterproof."
680,"00:29:20,344","00:29:21,345","Oh, Grissy,"
681,"00:29:21,428","00:29:25,265","this is the most romantic
honeymoon I've ever been on."
682,"00:29:25,349","00:29:26,266",Ever.
683,"00:29:26,350","00:29:28,602","Whoo!
It is a night of surprises!"
684,"00:29:32,606","00:29:35,317",To the water park! Whoo-hoo!
685,"00:29:44,826","00:29:46,078",Good old Rhonda.
686,"00:29:46,161","00:29:48,872","Completely waterproof, huh?"
687,"00:29:48,956","00:29:49,957","So, John Dory,"
688,"00:29:50,040","00:29:51,625","who wrote that song ""Girl,
I Love Your Love, Girl""?"
689,"00:29:51,708","00:29:52,835","-I did.
-Cool."
690,"00:29:52,918","00:29:54,294","Who wrote, ""Girl,
You Break My Heart, Girl""?"
691,"00:29:54,378","00:29:56,046","-I did.

-Shut up!"
697,"00:30:03,011","00:30:04,555","That was my favorite
BroZone song, like, ever."
698,"00:30:04,638","00:30:07,140",JK! Also me.
699,"00:30:07,224","00:30:08,642","Branch has never
written a song."
700,"00:30:08,725","00:30:09,893",I was a baby.
701,"00:30:09,977","00:30:11,895","What did you want me
to write about, diaper rash?"
702,"00:30:11,979","00:30:14,398","Okay, take it easy, Bitty B."
703,"00:30:15,274","00:30:17,276","Hey, what's wrong?"
704,"00:30:17,359","00:30:18,610",Nothing. Super happy.
705,"00:30:18,694","00:30:20,779","This is our most
fun mission yet. Yay."
706,"00:30:21,488","00:30:23,824","Branch, do you know
how lucky you are?"
707,"00:30:23,907","00:30:25,909","A brother is a friend
who can never leave you."
708,"00:30:25,993","00:30:27,578","It's the strongest bond
in the world."
709,"00:30:27,661","00:30:30,163","I would kill to have a sibling
to sing with, Branch."
710,"00:30:30,247","00:30:32,875","Ha! Yeah, well,
you can have mine."
711,"00:30:32,958","00:30:34,042",Okay. Fine.
712,"00:30:35,002","00:30:36,461","Poppy, wait."
713,"00:30:37,546","00:30:40,382",Grown-up stuff. Am I right?
714,"00:30:40,465","00:30:42,593","You know, I've still got
that thang, if you want it."
715,"00:30:42,676","00:30:44,970","Whoa, whoa. Don't be
waving that thing around."
716,"00:30:46,597","00:30:47,556","All right, y'all."
717,"00:30:47,639","00:30:49,558","We're getting close
to something."
718,"00:30:49,641","00:30:51,143",I can feel it.
719,"00:30:52,436","00:30:53,770",Whoa.

749,"00:32:21,358","00:32:23,235","Listen, I know you recognize
me from BroZone,"
750,"00:32:23,318","00:32:25,320","and I'm happy to give you
an autograph or whatever."
751,"00:32:25,404","00:32:26,989","But can you please
be discreet about it?"
752,"00:32:27,072","00:32:29,116","Spruce, it's us.
It's your brothers."
753,"00:32:29,199","00:32:31,952","-Whoa. Bitty B?
-What?"
754,"00:32:32,035","00:32:33,704",Whoa!
755,"00:32:33,787","00:32:36,206","No tossing, okay?
Too big to be tossed."
756,"00:32:36,290","00:32:38,792","The last time I saw you,
you were in diapers."
757,"00:32:38,876","00:32:40,169",Diapers. Right.
758,"00:32:40,252","00:32:41,378",Wet willy!
759,"00:32:41,461","00:32:43,255",Stop it. That's disgusting.
760,"00:32:43,338","00:32:45,507","-I am a grown-up.
-Oh, sorry."
761,"00:32:45,591","00:32:46,717",A wet William.
762,"00:32:46,800","00:32:47,801","Hi, Spruce. I'm Poppy."
763,"00:32:47,885","00:32:50,429","Wow. It's, like-- It's so cool
to meet you or whatever."
764,"00:32:50,512","00:32:51,471",This is Tiny Diamond.
765,"00:32:51,555","00:32:52,598","Hey, what's up?"
766,"00:32:52,681","00:32:54,683","Killer nachos you got here,
by the way."
767,"00:32:54,766","00:32:56,518","-Yeah!
-All right!"
768,"00:32:56,602","00:32:58,437","Okay, Spruce.
We're here because Floyd--"
769,"00:32:58,520","00:33:01,023","No one's called me Spruce
in years. I go by Bruce now."
770,"00:33:01,106","00:33:02,357",I'm sorry. Did you say Bruce?
771,"00:33:02,441","00:33:05,611","Yeah. I wanted to put the
whole boy band thing behind me"
772,"00:33:05,694","00:33:06,778",now that I'm a dad.
773,"00:33:06,862","00:33:08,739","Wait a minute.
You're a father?"
774,"00:33:08,822","00:33:11,617","Yeah. I can't wait
for you to meet everyone."
775,"00:33:11,700","00:33:14,369","Hi, honey. These are
my brothers, unexpectedly."
776,"00:33:14,453","00:33:18,707","Oh. Oh! Oh, hello there.
So nice to finally meet you."
777,"00:33:18,790","00:33:19,958","-Hi!
-Hello."
778,"00:33:20,042","00:33:22,419","This is my wife
and business partner, Brandy."
779,"00:33:22,503","00:33:24,004",She is my soulmate.
780,"00:33:24,087","00:33:25,839",My very tall soulmate.
781,"00:33:25,923","00:33:27,257",But we make it work.
782,"00:33:27,341","00:33:28,592",How?
783,"00:33:28,675","00:33:30,344","We don't even really know
how it works."
784,"00:33:30,427","00:33:32,721","I'm kidding. I'm--
I'm not. I'm-- I don't know."
785,"00:33:32,804","00:33:34,348","Daddy, Daddy,
can I have a cookie?"
786,"00:33:34,431","00:33:35,682",Becoming a dad was like a--
787,"00:33:35,766","00:33:37,476","like a seismic shift
in my brain."
788,"00:33:37,559","00:33:39,394","-Daddy, Bruce Jr. bit me.
-No biting."
789,"00:33:39,478","00:33:41,980","Daddy, I don't see how any
government stands a chance."
790,"00:33:42,064","00:33:43,106","You're not wrong, kid."
791,"00:33:43,190","00:33:44,650","I'm stuck
in this ketchup bottle."
792,"00:33:44,733","00:33:45,984","Okay.
Gonna handle all of that."
793,"00:33:46,068","00:33:48,737","Just give Daddy two seconds,
okay? Love you."
794,"00:33:48,820","00:33:49,821",As a dad--
795,"00:33:49,905","00:33:50,906","Daddy, Daddy, Daddy!
Guess what?"
796,"00:33:50,989","00:33:52,241",I have pink eye.
797,"00:33:52,324","00:33:53,784","Oh, my-- Pink eye."
798,"00:33:53,867","00:33:54,910","Oh,"
799,"00:33:54,993","00:33:56,495","Look, Spruce,
gotta cut to the chase."
800,"00:33:56,578","00:33:58,539","We're not here to catch up.
We're here because we need"
801,"00:33:58,622","00:34:00,332","to hit
the perfect family harmony."
802,"00:34:00,415","00:34:02,543","Oh, no. You're still
going on about that?"
803,"00:34:02,626","00:34:04,962","Hey. Get these guys
their meals to go."
804,"00:34:05,045","00:34:06,630","No, no, no.
You don't understand."
805,"00:34:06,713","00:34:09,007","It's for Floyd.
He's being held captive."
806,"00:34:09,091","00:34:10,842","What? Well, then,
what are we waiting for?"
807,"00:34:10,926","00:34:12,094","We need
to call the authorities."
808,"00:34:12,177","00:34:13,594","Hit the perfect
family harmony."
809,"00:34:13,679","00:34:15,973","Spruce, it-it-it has to be us."
810,"00:34:16,056","00:34:18,516","Floyd's being held captive
in a diamond prison."
811,"00:34:19,518","00:34:20,811","Oh. Well, yeah,"
812,"00:34:20,893","00:34:22,603","you need the perfect
family harmony for that."
813,"00:34:22,688","00:34:23,856",Exactly.
814,"00:34:23,938","00:34:24,940",Wait. But how?
815,"00:34:25,023","00:34:26,775","We've never even come close
to pulling it off."
816,"00:34:26,859","00:34:28,902","You do remember
our last show, don't you?"
817,"00:34:28,985","00:34:32,322","If we practice, I know
we'll be able to nail it."
818,"00:34:32,406","00:34:33,322",We have to.
819,"00:34:33,407","00:34:35,449","At my age?
I really don't think that--"
820,"00:34:35,534","00:34:38,579","See, guys. I told you
Dad wasn't in a band."
821,"00:34:38,661","00:34:41,373","Oh, I was in a band.
I was in the band."
822,"00:34:41,456","00:34:43,250","You ask your mother
if I was in a band."
823,"00:34:43,333","00:34:46,795","Oh, he was in a band."
824,"00:34:46,879","00:34:47,963",Prove it!
825,"00:34:48,045","00:34:50,924",Prove it! Prove it! Prove it!
826,"00:34:51,007","00:34:52,259","All right.
I'll-- I'll prove it."
827,"00:34:52,342","00:34:53,844",I'll prove it right now.
828,"00:34:53,927","00:34:56,471","-Yes! Bring it in, Brother.
-Go, Dad!"
829,"00:34:56,554","00:34:58,807","Branch, get up there.
Go sing with your brothers."
830,"00:34:58,891","00:35:00,893","I'll do it to save Floyd
when I have to."
831,"00:35:00,976","00:35:03,353","But I'm not doing it right now
just for ""funsies."""
832,"00:35:03,437","00:35:04,980","Oh, yeah.
Okay. You're probably right."
833,"00:35:05,063","00:35:06,607","No, no, no.
You're the one who--"
834,"00:35:06,690","00:35:07,900",Wait. What did you say?
835,"00:35:07,983","00:35:09,568",You're afraid that
836,"00:35:09,651","00:35:11,445","singing with your brothers
again after all these years"
837,"00:35:11,528","00:35:12,863","will overwhelm you
with emotions"
838,"00:35:12,946","00:35:15,032","too powerful for you
to handle. I agree with you."
839,"00:35:15,115","00:35:16,366","I don't think
you can handle it,"
840,"00:35:16,450","00:35:17,409","so I think
you shouldn't do it."
841,"00:35:17,492","00:35:18,911","I think I can handle
singing a song."
842,"00:35:18,994","00:35:20,245",Prove it!
843,"00:35:20,329","00:35:23,665","-Prove it! Prove it! Prove it!
-All right. Fine."
844,"00:35:24,333","00:35:25,918","But this is more than likely
beneath me."

1119,"00:46:42,219","00:46:45,889","Huh? Huh? Asking
the tough questions, guys."
1120,"00:46:45,973","00:46:48,433","-Asking the tough questions.
-Oh, right."
1121,"00:46:48,517","00:46:51,061","Anyway, I can't believe
you all are here."
1122,"00:46:51,144","00:46:52,312","Wait, where's Floyd?"
1123,"00:46:52,396","00:46:53,480",That's why we're here.
1124,"00:46:53,564","00:46:55,691","Floyd's been taken prisoner
in Mount Rageous"
1125,"00:46:55,774","00:46:57,818","by superstar singers
Velvet and Veneer…"
1126,"00:46:57,901","00:47:00,195","And the only thing
powerful enough to free him"
1127,"00:47:00,279","00:47:01,655",is the perfect family harmony.
1128,"00:47:02,322","00:47:04,616","Okay,
either they just made that up,"
1129,"00:47:04,700","00:47:06,827","or I have not
been paying attention."
1130,"00:47:06,910","00:47:09,037","Well, why haven't you
just called the authorities?"
1131,"00:47:09,121","00:47:11,582","Oh, unless Floyd is being held"
1132,"00:47:11,665","00:47:13,709","in an impenetrable
diamond prison."
1133,"00:47:13,792","00:47:16,253","-Yeah. That.
-I'm in."
1134,"00:47:16,336","00:47:18,839","I'd also like to volunteer to
keep track of our expenses."
1135,"00:47:18,922","00:47:20,507","Just 'cause I think
you're gonna need somebody"
1136,"00:47:20,591","00:47:21,675",to be on top of that.
1137,"00:47:21,758","00:47:24,344","Yeah, I don't think you'll get
any pushback on that front."
1138,"00:47:24,428","00:47:27,264","Great, but we need to leave
for Mount Rageous, like, now."
1139,"00:47:27,347","00:47:29,308","You can't leave now.
You just got here."
1140,"00:47:29,391","00:47:30,642","Come on.
Let me show you around."
1141,"00:47:30,726","00:47:32,853",Hug time!
1142,"00:47:33,520","00:47:35,230","-Uh…
-Yeah, no."
1143,"00:47:35,898","00:47:38,650","Aw, so cute. Where'd you get
that hug time bracelet?"
1144,"00:47:38,734","00:47:40,068",My dad gave it to me.
1145,"00:47:40,152","00:47:42,905","Okay,
this is so totally random,"
1146,"00:47:42,988","00:47:44,948","but I used to have one
just like it."
1147,"00:47:45,032","00:47:46,116",Can I see that?
1148,"00:47:46,992","00:47:48,493",Wow. It fits you perfectly.
1149,"00:47:49,203","00:47:50,287",Yeah.
1150,"00:47:56,585","00:47:58,587",Whoa.
1151,"00:47:58,670","00:47:59,922",I'm sorry.
1152,"00:48:00,005","00:48:01,798","What did you say
your name was again?"
1153,"00:48:01,882","00:48:03,091",I'm Poppy.
1154,"00:48:04,343","00:48:05,260",Poppy?
1155,"00:48:16,063","00:48:19,316","Okay, um, another totally
random, weird question,"
1156,"00:48:19,399","00:48:22,903",but is your dad King Peppy?
1157,"00:48:23,904","00:48:25,864","Uh, yeah?"
1158,"00:48:26,532","00:48:27,658",You're--
1159,"00:48:27,741","00:48:29,159","Oh, you're-- you're alive."
1160,"00:48:29,243","00:48:31,745","-I'm alive.
-This is unbelievable!"
1161,"00:48:31,828","00:48:33,539","I never thought
I'd see you again."
1162,"00:48:33,622","00:48:34,456",Again?
1163,"00:48:34,540","00:48:36,291","Poppy, it's me, Viva."
1164,"00:48:36,375","00:48:37,417",Uh…
1165,"00:48:38,085","00:48:39,086",I'm your sister.
1166,"00:48:39,169","00:48:41,004",My-- My what?
1167,"00:48:41,088","00:48:43,090",Your sister. Your hermana!
1168,"00:48:43,173","00:48:44,216",Whoa.
1169,"00:48:44,299","00:48:47,094","Hey, man. Am I the only one
without a long-lost sibling?"
1170,"00:48:47,177","00:48:48,637","What do you mean,
we're sisters?"
1171,"00:48:48,720","00:48:49,930","H-How could I have
not known about you?"
1172,"00:48:50,013","00:48:52,182","I can't believe Dad didn't
tell me I have a sister."
1173,"00:48:52,266","00:48:53,642","-That is…
-…so Dad."
1174,"00:48:53,725","00:48:55,352","Oh! I ca--
I can't believe this."
1175,"00:48:55,435","00:48:56,770","I've always dreamt
of having a sister."
1176,"00:48:56,854","00:48:58,522","I was just saying this.
Wasn't I just saying this?"
1177,"00:48:58,605","00:49:00,399","This means we can plan
each other's birthday parties."
1178,"00:49:00,482","00:49:01,608","-Yeah! And weddings.
-Yes!"
1179,"00:49:01,692","00:49:02,693","My best friend
had her wedding,"
1180,"00:49:02,776","00:49:03,819","and it went off
without a hitch."
1181,"00:49:03,902","00:49:04,903",I was the best maid of honor.
1182,"00:49:04,987","00:49:06,446","You'd be
the best maid of honor."
1183,"00:49:06,530","00:49:07,823","You and Bridget
are gonna love each other!"
1184,"00:49:07,906","00:49:08,907",I'm gonna love her.
1185,"00:49:08,991","00:49:10,450","-I love what you love.
-Yes!"
1186,"00:49:10,534","00:49:11,660",Yes!

essays instead of full novels."
1224,"00:50:43,877","00:50:46,255","-Ooh, I love that for you.
-Yeah."
1225,"00:50:46,338","00:50:48,924","But, um-- But just
to circle back real quick."
1226,"00:50:49,007","00:50:51,677","I still have a million
questions about what happened."
1227,"00:50:51,760","00:50:52,970","I used to live
at the Troll Tree."
1228,"00:50:53,053","00:50:54,179","I was there
when you were born."
1229,"00:50:54,263","00:50:55,514",And you were so cute.
1230,"00:50:55,597","00:50:58,392","Kinda like you are now, only
teensier and weensier and--"
1231,"00:50:59,393","00:51:01,270","Do you wanna make candy
necklaces that we never finish"
1232,"00:51:01,353","00:51:03,564","-because we eat all the candy?
-Obviously!"
1233,"00:51:03,647","00:51:06,942","But, Veev, I'm just gonna need
you to focus here and--"
1234,"00:51:07,025","00:51:08,443",and tell me everything.
1235,"00:51:08,527","00:51:10,362","Why am I only learning
about you now?"
1236,"00:51:10,445","00:51:12,030",What happened?
1237,"00:51:12,114","00:51:14,575",We got accidentally separated.
1238,"00:51:14,658","00:51:16,535","And I've lived
here ever since. The end."
1239,"00:51:16,618","00:51:18,328",Wanna do candy toe rings next?
1240,"00:51:18,412","00:51:20,873","Uh, accidentally separated?"
1241,"00:51:20,956","00:51:23,041","Viva doesn't like
to talk about it."
1242,"00:51:23,125","00:51:24,376",It's too painful for her.
1243,"00:51:24,459","00:51:25,711",But she's been here ever since
1244,"00:51:25,794","00:51:27,045","the night
of the great Bergen attack."
1245,"00:51:28,589","00:51:30,132","Viva, are you talking
about the night"
1246,"00:51:30,215","00:51:32,301","the trolls
escaped Bergen Town?"
1247,"00:51:32,384","00:51:33,927","Oh, yeah."
1248,"00:51:34,011","00:51:35,637","Yeah,
I guess it was that night."
1249,"00:51:37,598","00:51:39,766","Not everyone
made it out of that tree."
1250,"00:51:40,475","00:51:42,352","Some of them got trapped
by Bergens."
1251,"00:51:42,436","00:51:43,854","They were this close
to getting eaten…"
1252,"00:51:43,937","00:51:44,938",…until Viva
1253,"00:51:45,022","00:51:46,940","and some of the other trolls
fought them off."
1254,"00:51:48,609","00:51:49,610",But by then…
1255,"00:51:50,736","00:51:51,904","the tunnels had collapsed,"
1256,"00:51:51,987","00:51:53,655","and they were cut off
from the rest."
1257,"00:51:53,739","00:51:56,825","I kept screaming,
""No troll left behind!"""
1258,"00:51:56,909","00:52:00,245","But when I went back in,
the tunnels had collapsed."
1259,"00:52:00,329","00:52:03,123","That's when I found
Viva's hug time bracelet."
1260,"00:52:03,207","00:52:06,543","Viva found this old,
abandoned Bergen golf course"
1261,"00:52:06,627","00:52:08,378","and transformed it
into this troll utopia."
1262,"00:52:08,462","00:52:11,340","We formed this little
sanctuary of survivors."
1263,"00:52:11,423","00:52:12,633",I added fire exits.
1264,"00:52:12,716","00:52:14,051",She added her heart and soul.
1265,"00:52:14,134","00:52:17,054","I've thought so many times
about leaving, you know,"
1266,"00:52:17,137","00:52:20,807","to look for you and Dad,
but it's not safe out there."
1267,"00:52:20,891","00:52:25,312","I know I should've told Poppy,
but my heart was broken."
1268,"00:52:25,395","00:52:27,022",I felt like a failure.
1269,"00:52:27,105","00:52:29,775","Not just as a king,
but as a father."
1270,"00:52:29,858","00:52:31,276",I feel so guilty.
1271,"00:52:31,360","00:52:32,736",What do you think I should do?
1272,"00:52:33,695","00:52:35,697","I'm afraid
that's our time for today."
1273,"00:52:35,781","00:52:38,158","But I just
revealed a major trauma."
1274,"00:52:42,037","00:52:44,164","Okay. Obviously this is a lot,"
1275,"00:52:44,248","00:52:45,749","and you should be able
to open up about this"
1276,"00:52:45,832","00:52:46,875",on your own time.
1277,"00:52:46,959","00:52:48,460","But we'll have plenty of time
to work through this"
1278,"00:52:48,544","00:52:49,628",on the way to Mount Rageous.
1279,"00:52:49,711","00:52:52,381","Whoa! I am not going
to Mount Rageous."
1280,"00:52:52,464","00:52:53,799","And neither are you, silly."
1281,"00:52:53,882","00:52:55,425","You're never
gonna leave again."
1282,"00:52:58,762","00:53:01,056","Wait, what was the--
What was that last thing?"
1283,"00:53:01,723","00:53:03,058","Okay, guys,
if we're gonna save Floyd,"
1284,"00:53:03,141","00:53:04,351",we need to get going.
1285,"00:53:04,434","00:53:05,435",I'll go get Poppy.
1286,"00:53:05,519","00:53:07,145","No, no, no, wait. Hold on."
1287,"00:53:07,229","00:53:08,897","There's no way
Viva's gonna let her go."
1288,"00:53:08,981","00:53:10,816","What?
W-What are you talking about?"
1289,"00:53:10,899","00:53:13,443","Like I said, she's got
some stuff going on, man."
1290,"00:53:13,527","00:53:16,697","If we don't wanna get trapped,
we should sneak out now."
1291,"00:53:25,789","00:53:29,293","Oh, hey… …Viva.
What's up, girl?"
1292,"00:53:29,376","00:53:31,545",Viva! What are you doing?
1293,"00:53:31,628","00:53:34,506","You're not leaving here
no matter what, because--"
1294,"00:53:35,007","00:53:37,217","because it's just not safe
out there. You're welcome."
1295,"00:53:37,301","00:53:38,635","Wait, is this
about the Bergens?"
1296,"00:53:38,719","00:53:41,054","Because they stopped
trying to eat us."
1297,"00:53:41,138","00:53:42,097",That's all in the past.
1298,"00:53:42,181","00:53:43,265","Yeah, right."
1299,"00:53:43,348","00:53:45,642","That's hilarious, Poppy.
I'm laughing really hard."
1300,"00:53:45,726","00:53:47,060","I'm serious, Viva."
1301,"00:53:47,144","00:53:48,729","Bridget, my best friend
I was telling you about,"
1302,"00:53:48,812","00:53:50,397",she's a Bergen.
1303,"00:53:50,480","00:53:52,900","Look. Bridget and I do
a million fun things together."
1304,"00:53:52,983","00:53:54,943","We talk and we play games
and we sing songs."
1305,"00:53:55,027","00:53:56,445","And make up
these really bad dances."
1306,"00:53:56,528","00:53:58,197",It's a lot like--
1307,"00:53:58,280","00:53:59,114","Well, actually,"
1308,"00:53:59,198","00:54:01,116","it's a lot like what you
and I have been doing."
1309,"00:54:01,200","00:54:03,744","The world's a lot different
than it used to be."
1310,"00:54:03,827","00:54:06,496","Viva, look,
I used to be just like you."
1311,"00:54:06,580","00:54:07,748","I built a bunker,"
1312,"00:54:07,831","00:54:10,250","and I lived in it for years
because I knew it was safe."
1313,"00:54:10,334","00:54:13,253","And, sure, i-it kept me alive."
1314,"00:54:13,337","00:54:15,881",And I never had to wear pants.
1315,"00:54:16,507","00:54:20,177","But I was living
without pants."
1316,"00:54:20,761","00:54:22,095",Does that make sense?
1317,"00:54:22,179","00:54:23,305","Well, I feel judged."
1318,"00:54:23,388","00:54:25,015",You don't understand.
1319,"00:54:25,098","00:54:27,184",I just got my sister back.
1320,"00:54:27,267","00:54:29,770","I'm not gonna lose you.
For anything."
1321,"00:54:34,775","00:54:35,984",Clay?
1322,"00:54:36,068","00:54:38,362","I'm sorry, Viva,
but we have to leave."
1323,"00:54:39,196","00:54:40,739","I don't wanna lose
my brother either."
1324,"00:54:43,158","00:54:44,284",Let's move!
1325,"00:54:45,494","00:54:47,621","No. No, Poppy, wait!"
1326,"00:54:52,167","00:54:54,002","Poppy, please!"
1327,"00:54:55,087","00:54:56,421",I want you to stay!
1328,"00:54:57,005","00:54:58,549","Viva, I can't do that."
1329,"00:54:59,258","00:55:00,551",But you can come with us.
1330,"00:55:00,634","00:55:02,177","And I know you
think it's risky,"
1331,"00:55:02,261","00:55:04,137","and maybe it is,
but it'll be worth it."
1332,"00:55:04,972","00:55:06,515",Family's always worth it.
1333,"00:55:09,685","00:55:11,103","No, no, no, I--"
1334,"00:55:12,020","00:55:13,105",I can't.
1335,"00:55:39,006","00:55:41,258","Knock, knock. Almost showtime."
1336,"00:55:41,341","00:55:42,342",Ugh.
1337,"00:55:42,426","00:55:43,427",No sign of BroZone?
1338,"00:55:43,510","00:55:45,804",No. But I have an idea.
1339,"00:55:45,888","00:55:48,682",We could practice.
1340,"00:55:48,765","00:55:50,684","I wanna be famous,"
1341,"00:55:50,767","00:55:53,061","but I'm not gonna work for it.
Ew."
1342,"00:55:53,145","00:55:54,313",Come on.
1343,"00:55:54,396","00:55:55,689","We used to make up
little dances together"
1344,"00:55:55,772","00:55:57,149","all the time, remember?"
1345,"00:55:57,232","00:55:58,984","Hip, hip. Twist. Flip."
1346,"00:55:59,067","00:56:00,485",Our dances sucked.
1347,"00:56:00,569","00:56:02,112","How many fans
do you think we can get"
1348,"00:56:02,196","00:56:03,780",making up sucky dances?
1349,"00:56:03,864","00:56:06,408","Hey, hello? Hello in there."
1350,"00:56:06,491","00:56:08,243",Wake up. Wakey-wakey.
1351,"00:56:08,327","00:56:09,244",Oh.
1352,"00:56:09,328","00:56:11,288","He's dead? Oh, man."
1353,"00:56:11,371","00:56:12,623",What have we done?
1354,"00:56:12,706","00:56:14,208",What do we do?
1355,"00:56:14,291","00:56:16,168","You remember the goldfish
you had as a kid?"
1356,"00:56:16,251","00:56:17,503",You mean Sparkles?
1357,"00:56:18,921","00:56:20,881","Mkay. Goodbye, little guy."
1358,"00:56:20,964","00:56:22,341","Please, hurry up and flush."
1359,"00:56:22,424","00:56:24,092","Being this close to you
next to a toilet…"
1360,"00:56:24,176","00:56:25,636",…makes me uncomfortable.
1361,"00:56:27,721","00:56:28,639",Wow.
1362,"00:56:28,722","00:56:30,432","I thought ghosts
just floated away."
1363,"00:56:30,516","00:56:32,351","Well, don't just stand there.
Go get him!"
1364,"00:56:32,434","00:56:33,519",Why does it have to be me?
1365,"00:56:33,602","00:56:36,104","Because Crimp's locked
in the closet. Now, go!"
1366,"00:56:36,188","00:56:37,731",Help! Help!
1367,"00:56:39,942","00:56:41,068","Help me, please."
1368,"00:56:42,152","00:56:43,237",Help!
1369,"00:56:47,115","00:56:48,116",Gotcha.
1370,"00:56:49,826","00:56:51,870","Please, Veneer,
just let me run past you."
1371,"00:56:51,954","00:56:53,664","You can pretend
you never saw me."
1372,"00:56:53,747","00:56:55,249","It--
It'll be our little secret."
1373,"00:56:56,291","00:56:57,501",I can't.
1374,"00:56:57,584","00:56:59,920",I know. Velvet would kill you.
1375,"00:57:00,879","00:57:02,548","But just because
she's your sister"
1376,"00:57:02,631","00:57:05,008","doesn't mean you should let
her treat you like garbage."
1377,"00:57:06,260","00:57:07,594","-Doesn't it?
-No."
1378,"00:57:07,678","00:57:11,056","Sibling or not, you deserve
to be treated with kindness"
1379,"00:57:11,139","00:57:12,766","and to be around people
who would never try"
1380,"00:57:12,850","00:57:14,685","to change the you
that you are."
1381,"00:57:15,686","00:57:16,603",You got him.
1382,"00:57:17,354","00:57:19,731","Hey, I know I probably
don't say this enough,"
1383,"00:57:19,815","00:57:21,441",but good job.
1384,"00:57:23,485","00:57:25,404","We really make a great team.
Don't we, bro?"
1385,"00:57:27,739","00:57:28,824","Now, come on."
1386,"00:57:28,907","00:57:30,742","We should also probably
hire a new assistant,"
1387,"00:57:30,826","00:57:33,287",which feels like a you job.
1388,"00:57:33,370","00:57:35,998","Crimp!
Hire us a new assistant!"
1389,"00:57:36,081","00:57:37,291",I'm on it!
1390,"00:57:40,919","00:57:42,171",BroZone.

from the top."

some smolder in those eyes."
1407,"00:58:18,957","00:58:21,835","Clay, you're being too stiff.
We need some sillier robot."
1408,"00:58:21,919","00:58:23,462","Bitty B,
maybe a smaller diaper."
1409,"00:58:23,545","00:58:26,006","If this diaper was any
smaller, I could taste it."
1410,"00:58:26,089","00:58:27,799","That's why
I don't wear one of those."
1411,"00:58:27,883","00:58:29,635",It's a hard fit to pull off.
1412,"00:58:29,718","00:58:32,095","Really great note, John Dory.
Super helpful. Thanks. Thanks."
1413,"00:58:32,179","00:58:33,722","Now I have a creative note
for you."
1414,"00:58:33,805","00:58:35,724","-Stop being bossy!
-What?"
1415,"00:58:35,807","00:58:38,143","I'm not being bossy.
I'm helping us be better."
1416,"00:58:38,227","00:58:39,520","No. No, dude."
1417,"00:58:39,603","00:58:40,646","You're forcing us
to be perfect,"
1418,"00:58:40,729","00:58:41,730","just like you always have,"
1419,"00:58:41,813","00:58:43,482","so we can hit
the perfect family harmony."
1420,"00:58:43,565","00:58:44,983",Yeah. For Floyd.
1421,"00:58:45,067","00:58:45,984",Is it?
1422,"00:58:46,068","00:58:48,111","Or is this all just so you can
tell people what to do again?"
1423,"00:58:48,195","00:58:49,446","-Wha-- What?
-Guys, guys."
1424,"00:58:49,530","00:58:50,447",This isn't helpful right now.
1425,"00:58:50,531","00:58:51,573","Let's all maybe take five,
huh?"
1426,"00:58:51,657","00:58:53,325","This isn't gonna work
if you keep on being"
1427,"00:58:53,408","00:58:54,451",the same old John Dory.
1428,"00:58:54,535","00:58:55,953",Yeah. We've all changed.
1429,"00:58:56,036","00:58:57,120",Bruce settled down.
1430,"00:58:57,204","00:58:59,915","Branch is slightly taller,
with zero glasses."
1431,"00:58:59,998","00:59:01,333",And I'm a licensed CPA.
1432,"00:59:01,416","00:59:02,876","Put some respect
on my name, fool!"
1433,"00:59:02,960","00:59:04,711","Well,
I'm not allowed to change."
1434,"00:59:04,795","00:59:06,797","I'm the oldest.
I had to be the leader."
1435,"00:59:06,880","00:59:09,383","You love bossing
us around. Just admit it."
1436,"00:59:09,466","00:59:11,176","Why do you think I moved
to the middle of nowhere?"
1437,"00:59:11,260","00:59:12,928","So I didn't have to be
in charge of anyone."
1438,"00:59:13,011","00:59:15,180","Four little brothers
is a lot of responsibility."
1439,"00:59:15,264","00:59:16,682",Why do you think I left?
1440,"00:59:16,765","00:59:18,559","So no one would treat me
like you did."
1441,"00:59:18,642","00:59:21,061","-You know what, Spruce--
-It's Bruce!"
1442,"00:59:21,144","00:59:22,187","Thank you, Clay."
1443,"00:59:22,271","00:59:23,981","Guys.
We can't forget about Floyd."
1444,"00:59:24,064","00:59:25,983","Look, Branch is right.
We're here for Floyd."
1445,"00:59:26,066","00:59:28,151","Let's just get this done and
we can go our separate ways."
1446,"00:59:28,235","00:59:29,278",Fine.
1447,"00:59:29,361","00:59:30,279",Wait. What?
1448,"00:59:30,946","00:59:32,990","What? The mission's
the mission."
1449,"00:59:33,073","00:59:34,408","You didn't think
we'd all live together"
1450,"00:59:34,491","00:59:35,701","when this was all over,
did you?"
1451,"00:59:35,784","00:59:38,370","Singing songs
and roasting marshmallows?"
1452,"00:59:38,453","00:59:41,623","Oh, I'm sorry.
Is that funny to you?"
1453,"00:59:41,707","00:59:44,459","That I might want us
to actually be a family again?"
1454,"00:59:46,879","00:59:49,339","Tiny Diamond, pull over. Now."
1455,"00:59:53,927","00:59:55,345","Don't be a baby, Branch."
1456,"00:59:56,638","00:59:57,890","You're mad at him,"
1457,"00:59:57,973","01:00:00,184","but you guys do
the exact same thing to me."
1458,"01:00:00,267","01:00:02,644","You all still treat me like
the baby of the family."
1459,"01:00:02,728","01:00:04,062",But guess what?
1460,"01:00:04,146","01:00:07,274","I stopped being a baby the day
you guys walked out on me,"
1461,"01:00:07,357","01:00:08,901",'cause I had to.
1462,"01:00:08,984","01:00:10,027","Then Grandma got eaten,"
1463,"01:00:10,110","01:00:11,820","and there was no one else
to take care of me."
1464,"01:00:11,904","01:00:14,990","This time,
I'm walking out on you."
1465,"01:00:21,580","01:00:23,207",This is Branch's bunker.
1466,"01:00:24,583","01:00:27,377",He built this for you guys.
1467,"01:00:29,546","01:00:30,714",I didn't know.
1468,"01:00:32,591","01:00:33,884",I guess you never asked.
1469,"01:00:36,929","01:00:37,930",Wait.
1470,"01:00:38,013","01:00:39,640",Grandma got eaten?
1471,"01:00:42,935","01:00:44,144","Branch, wait!"
1472,"01:00:44,770","01:00:45,771",Branch!
1473,"01:00:45,854","01:00:47,147",Where are you going?
1474,"01:00:47,231","01:00:49,483",To save Floyd. Alone.
1475,"01:00:49,566","01:00:51,902","I didn't need them growing up,
and I don't need them now."
1476,"01:00:51,985","01:00:54,029",What-- What are you doing?
1477,"01:00:54,112","01:00:55,906","What do you mean?
I'm coming with you."
1478,"01:00:56,657","01:00:57,991",Why bother?
1479,"01:00:58,075","01:01:00,327","Aren't you gonna
leave me eventually anyway?"
1480,"01:01:00,827","01:01:02,120",Everyone else does.
1481,"01:01:07,000","01:01:09,670","I have been by your side
from the moment we met."
1482,"01:01:09,753","01:01:11,547",And you've been by mine.
1483,"01:01:11,630","01:01:13,632","Let's give each other
some credit here."
1484,"01:01:13,715","01:01:15,050",Right.
1485,"01:01:15,133","01:01:17,135","Uh, I'm sorry. Thank you."
1486,"01:01:17,803","01:01:18,804",You're welcome.
1487,"01:01:19,638","01:01:20,931",And I'm not going anywhere.
1488,"01:01:22,057","01:01:23,267",Unless it's with you.
1489,"01:01:24,393","01:01:25,602",To save Floyd.
1490,"01:01:31,316","01:01:33,610",Tiny! You're coming too?
1491,"01:01:33,694","01:01:34,611","Hey, what can I say?"
1492,"01:01:34,695","01:01:36,655",I was moved by Branch's speech
1493,"01:01:36,738","01:01:38,991","and his sad, sad drawing."
1494,"01:01:39,074","01:01:40,200","Now, let's roll."
1495,"01:01:49,168","01:01:50,210","Wow, Grissy."
1496,"01:01:50,294","01:01:51,587",I've never seen anyone
1497,"01:01:51,670","01:01:53,463","get kicked out
of a water park like that."
1498,"01:01:53,547","01:01:54,631","All right, for the record,"
1499,"01:01:54,715","01:01:56,550","it was the water slide
that ripped off my trunks."
1500,"01:01:56,633","01:01:58,427","Ooh, so hot."
1501,"01:01:59,595","01:02:01,346",Wait.
1502,"01:02:01,430","01:02:02,681",Do you smell…
1503,"01:02:03,974","01:02:05,184",French fries!
1504,"01:02:05,267","01:02:07,144",French fries.
1505,"01:02:16,778","01:02:18,405",Ew.
1506,"01:02:18,488","01:02:19,615",Who goes there?
1507,"01:02:21,200","01:02:23,410","Putt-Putt.
Putt-Putt. Putt-Putt."
1508,"01:02:25,621","01:02:27,206",Are those golf balls?
1509,"01:02:27,915","01:02:28,832",Putt-Putt.
1510,"01:02:28,916","01:02:31,793","Oh, good. They're just trolls.
Look how cute."
1511,"01:02:35,756","01:02:37,090",What's happening?
1512,"01:02:37,174","01:02:39,051",Ow!
1513,"01:02:40,427","01:02:43,222","Grissy, I didn't think we'd
both find ourselves tied up"
1514,"01:02:43,305","01:02:44,515",on this honeymoon.
1515,"01:02:51,605","01:02:52,856","All right, look."
1516,"01:02:52,940","01:02:54,233",Security is really tight.
1517,"01:02:54,316","01:02:56,318","So we're not gonna be able
to just walk right in."
1518,"01:02:56,401","01:02:58,820","You know what that means.
We're scaling the walls."
1519,"01:02:58,904","01:03:00,781",We're huh? Doing what? When?
1520,"01:03:01,448","01:03:02,866","We should plan
to make our ascent"
1521,"01:03:02,950","01:03:04,660","about 200 meters east
of the entrance."
1522,"01:03:05,827","01:03:07,579","Good thing I brought
extra gummy gloves."
1523,"01:03:07,663","01:03:09,998",I'm tired. Carry me.
1524,"01:03:10,082","01:03:11,333","You have to walk on your own,
Tiny."
1525,"01:03:11,416","01:03:12,584",You have to be a big boy.
1526,"01:03:12,668","01:03:15,128","But my feet hurt.
I don't wanna."
1527,"01:03:15,212","01:03:16,964","The quickest way in
will be at the roof."
1528,"01:03:17,047","01:03:18,340",The HVAC system.
1529,"01:03:18,423","01:03:21,718","-Ooh. I love how you say HVAC.
-Thank you."
1530,"01:03:21,802","01:03:24,304","But we'll have
to bypass the fan blade,"
1531,"01:03:24,388","01:03:26,974","so that our cupcakes
don't get sliced in two."
1532,"01:03:27,057","01:03:29,434","-Ooh! We brought cupcakes?
-No."
1533,"01:03:29,518","01:03:31,103","Not what I meant.
It doesn't matter."
1534,"01:03:43,282","01:03:44,783","After that,
we need to cut the power,"
1535,"01:03:44,867","01:03:45,909",so we can move freely
1536,"01:03:45,993","01:03:47,536","through
the interior air ducts."
1537,"01:03:47,619","01:03:49,413","How do you know
which wires to cut?"
1538,"01:03:49,496","01:03:50,414",I don't.
1539,"01:03:50,497","01:03:52,791","I'm just blasting everything
until something turns off."
1540,"01:03:54,459","01:03:55,711",Hello?
1541,"01:03:56,295","01:03:58,297","From there, we'll
have to do some exploring,"
1542,"01:03:58,380","01:04:00,507","but we'll find Floyd
in one of those rooms."
1543,"01:04:01,049","01:04:02,509",Look. There he is.
1544,"01:04:06,972","01:04:08,056",Come on.
1545,"01:04:11,018","01:04:12,352",Floyd.
1546,"01:04:13,562","01:04:15,814",Branch? Is it really you?
1547,"01:04:15,898","01:04:16,982",Yeah.
1548,"01:04:17,065","01:04:18,400",It's really me.
1549,"01:04:19,067","01:04:21,737","Wow. You've
really grown into that vest."
1550,"01:04:21,820","01:04:23,071",You're a man now.
1551,"01:04:23,739","01:04:26,783","Oh! Finally, somebody gets me."
1552,"01:04:29,411","01:04:31,371","But you need to leave.
Right now."
1553,"01:04:31,455","01:04:33,415","No, Floyd. It's okay.
We're here to rescue you."
1554,"01:04:33,498","01:04:34,833",No. This is a trap.
1555,"01:04:34,917","01:04:37,085","Velvet and Veneer, they--
they lured you here."
1556,"01:04:37,169","01:04:39,254","You gotta leave before
they come back. Hurry!"
1557,"01:04:39,338","01:04:41,548","No. I'm not leaving here
without you."
1558,"01:04:41,632","01:04:42,883","Branch, please."
1559,"01:04:42,966","01:04:44,343","-Do it for me.
-We're so close."
1560,"01:04:44,426","01:04:46,136","I told you BroZone
would show up."
1561,"01:04:46,220","01:04:48,138","My letter worked.
I'm a genius."
1562,"01:04:48,222","01:04:50,182","Are you sure
you're sure about this?"
1563,"01:05:00,275","01:05:01,401","Oh, no."
1564,"01:05:01,485","01:05:03,111",Oh! Ow!
1565,"01:05:03,195","01:05:04,947","It's biting me.
Put it in the closet."
1566,"01:05:05,030","01:05:06,406",Put it in the closet!
1567,"01:05:06,907","01:05:07,991",Hello.
1568,"01:05:09,201","01:05:11,161","-Floyd!
-Brothers."
1569,"01:05:11,245","01:05:13,372","It's so good to see you. We
would have been here sooner,"
1570,"01:05:13,455","01:05:15,374","but these guys wouldn't stop
yelling at each other."
1571,"01:05:15,457","01:05:16,500","Guys, please."
1572,"01:05:16,583","01:05:18,043","John Dory,
you're the one who parked"
1573,"01:05:18,126","01:05:19,962","in the spot marked
""Reserved for BroZone."""
1574,"01:05:20,045","01:05:21,797","Didn't that seem
a little sus to you?"
1575,"01:05:21,880","01:05:24,091","-Oh, so it's my fault?
-Oh, look."
1576,"01:05:24,174","01:05:25,968","They're even cute
when they fight."
1577,"01:05:26,051","01:05:27,511","-Boop, boop, boop.
-Hey. Stop."
1578,"01:05:27,594","01:05:28,595",What are you doing?
1579,"01:05:28,679","01:05:30,097","Come on, man.
You're better than this."
1580,"01:05:30,180","01:05:31,098","Well, thank you."
1581,"01:05:31,181","01:05:32,724","I really don't see why
you're so upset."
1582,"01:05:32,808","01:05:34,935","At least we're putting
your talent to good use."
1583,"01:05:35,018","01:05:36,812","I mean, you're welcome."
1584,"01:05:36,895","01:05:38,063",What? You're sick.
1585,"01:05:38,146","01:05:39,481","You mispronounced,"
1586,"01:05:39,565","01:05:41,859","""Thanks for not letting our

1590,"01:05:48,824","01:05:51,201","Oh, that's fun.
I'll grab my butt marker."
1591,"01:06:02,462","01:06:04,715","Oh, it looks like
you need a hug."
1592,"01:06:10,095","01:06:12,222","Okay, now,

if we made out?"
1598,"01:06:27,237","01:06:29,781","Babe, it would be weird
if we didn't."
1599,"01:06:41,627","01:06:42,711",Wait!
1600,"01:06:53,722","01:06:54,848",Is this you?
1601,"01:06:55,682","01:06:58,227","Hey.
That's me and my best friend."
1602,"01:06:58,310","01:07:01,647",Yeah. Poppy. She--
1603,"01:07:02,523","01:07:03,565",She's my sister.
1604,"01:07:04,233","01:07:05,943",You're Poppy's sister?

best friends too."
1606,"01:07:08,195","01:07:10,364","Yeah. She told me about
your wedding."
1607,"01:07:10,864","01:07:13,075","-Congratulations.
-Thanks, girl."
1608,"01:07:14,826","01:07:16,787",I think I made a huge mistake.
1609,"01:07:16,870","01:07:19,122","It's fine.
We're not gonna press charges."
1610,"01:07:19,206","01:07:20,832","I don't think
that's what she means."
1611,"01:07:20,916","01:07:23,210","Yeah, no. That's not
what I'm talking about."
1612,"01:07:24,294","01:07:26,213","So, you're really
not gonna eat us?"
1613,"01:07:26,296","01:07:28,882",No. But I understand the fear.
1614,"01:07:28,966","01:07:31,510","If you want,
I can open my mouth"
1615,"01:07:31,593","01:07:33,929","and you can take

systematic desensitization."
