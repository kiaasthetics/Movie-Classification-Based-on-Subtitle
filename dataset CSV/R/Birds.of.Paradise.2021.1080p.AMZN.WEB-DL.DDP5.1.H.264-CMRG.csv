1,"00:01:40,726","00:01:42,770",Stop the music!
2,"00:01:51,737","00:01:53,113",What was that?
3,"00:01:55,115","00:01:57,034","Glissade assemblé, sissonne..."
4,"00:01:58,369","00:02:01,205",You are a dancer...
5,"00:02:01,288","00:02:03,582","- not a horse.
- I'm sorry."
6,"00:02:03,666","00:02:04,917",I don't speak French.
7,"00:02:05,000","00:02:06,502",I took Spanish
8,"00:02:06,585","00:02:08,337","'cause my dad said
it would be more useful,"
9,"00:02:08,420","00:02:10,422","but honestly,
French would be really useful..."
10,"00:02:10,506","00:02:12,550","- Why are you here?
- Um..."
11,"00:02:12,633","00:02:14,385","I've placed first
in every competition"
12,"00:02:14,468","00:02:16,512","in the States
for the past two years."
13,"00:02:16,595","00:02:18,597","A-All my teachers
recommended that I..."
14,"00:02:18,681","00:02:21,392","Mademoiselle Sanders,
as a scholarship recipient,"
15,"00:02:21,475","00:02:24,353",I expect a real answer.
16,"00:02:24,436","00:02:26,313",I'll ask you one more time.
17,"00:02:27,565","00:02:30,025",Why have you come here?
18,"00:02:38,784","00:02:40,536",I'm here to win the prize.
19,"00:03:10,274","00:03:11,901",Marine!
20,"00:03:13,193","00:03:14,570",Marine!
21,"00:03:20,951","00:03:24,288","I told you, you're not allowed
to touch anything in this room."
22,"00:03:25,873","00:03:28,459","You said you wanted to win
the prize for Ollie."
23,"00:03:28,542","00:03:30,002",I do.
24,"00:03:30,085","00:03:31,879","Then what are you still
doing here?"
25,"00:03:53,400","00:03:56,570","Training will be
rigorous and begins before dawn."
26,"00:03:58,030","00:03:59,615","The lowest-ranked rats
may be sent home"
27,"00:03:59,698","00:04:01,450","at the discretion
of Madame Brunelle."
28,"00:04:02,451","00:04:03,661",Five girls and five boys
29,"00:04:03,744","00:04:06,288","will be dancing
in the final presentation."
30,"00:04:06,372","00:04:08,791","And from this,
only one girl and one boy"
31,"00:04:08,874","00:04:11,251",will be awarded the prize:
32,"00:04:11,335","00:04:15,047","a contract to join the company
of the Paris Opera Ballet."
33,"00:04:23,681","00:04:25,224",Who is she?
34,"00:04:25,307","00:04:28,852","Apparently she only started
dancing five years ago."
35,"00:04:28,936","00:04:30,479","Before that she
played basketball."
36,"00:04:32,064","00:04:33,357","- Basketball?
- Oui."
37,"00:04:33,440","00:04:36,026","She's too awkward
to be a ballerina."
38,"00:04:56,296","00:04:58,424","Oh, fuck."
39,"00:04:58,507","00:05:00,509",What are you doing back?
40,"00:05:00,592","00:05:02,386",Had nothing better to do.
41,"00:05:02,469","00:05:03,762",What's new?
42,"00:05:03,846","00:05:06,849","After you left last fall,
Gia took number one."
43,"00:05:07,850","00:05:09,268",She's the favorite.
44,"00:05:13,272","00:05:14,565",You're back?
45,"00:05:14,648","00:05:16,692","Nice to see you, too."
46,"00:05:17,943","00:05:20,404","You broke out
of the mental hospital?"
47,"00:05:20,487","00:05:22,031",You flatter me.
48,"00:05:23,073","00:05:25,868","Felipe... you're up, baby."
49,"00:05:38,047","00:05:40,049",How do my leftovers taste?
50,"00:05:40,132","00:05:41,592",Like victory.
51,"00:05:42,926","00:05:46,096",Hetero dancers are such sluts.
52,"00:05:46,180","00:05:49,183","Cover my tattoos so the devil
doesn't shit her Spanx."
53,"00:05:53,645","00:05:55,064",Felipe's so good.
54,"00:05:55,147","00:05:56,899",He's the best.
55,"00:05:58,025","00:06:01,153","If Ollie were here,
he'd be better."
56,"00:06:01,236","00:06:03,572",No one is better than Felipe.
57,"00:06:03,655","00:06:06,450",Ollie was always number one.
58,"00:06:06,533","00:06:08,368",Who's Ollie?
59,"00:06:09,453","00:06:10,453",Who are you?
60,"00:06:10,496","00:06:11,872",I'm Kate.
61,"00:06:11,955","00:06:13,290",Hi.
62,"00:06:13,373","00:06:15,375",I'm the one from Virginia.
63,"00:06:15,459","00:06:17,836",She's here to take your place.
64,"00:06:19,088","00:06:20,839","Oh, Ollie."
65,"00:06:20,923","00:06:23,884","Yes, he was the dancer who..."
66,"00:06:23,967","00:06:26,303","He jumped off a bridge, right?"
67,"00:06:26,386","00:06:28,013",What'd you say?
68,"00:06:29,598","00:06:31,183","M, stop..."
69,"00:06:31,266","00:06:33,852","- Uh...
- What the fuck did you say?"
70,"00:06:33,936","00:06:35,145","- I...
- He didn't jump."
71,"00:06:35,229","00:06:38,232","Sorry. I read a post that
he jumped off a bridge."
72,"00:06:40,609","00:06:42,319","- Oh, my God.
- Stop!"
73,"00:06:52,329","00:06:53,956","Putain, putain."
74,"00:07:04,133","00:07:05,717",I'm gonna kill you!
75,"00:07:05,801","00:07:07,636",I'm gonna fucking kill you!
76,"00:07:12,891","00:07:14,977","Absolute perfection, Felipe."
77,"00:07:15,060","00:07:16,645",Thank you.
78,"00:07:16,728","00:07:18,438",He was the last rat?
79,"00:07:26,822","00:07:29,408","So you decided
to join us after all."
80,"00:07:29,491","00:07:32,161","Your parents made quite the case
for your return."
81,"00:07:32,244","00:07:33,829",I'm not doing it for them.
82,"00:07:33,912","00:07:35,914",I'm doing it for Ollie.
83,"00:08:11,241","00:08:13,160",I'm Luc.
84,"00:08:13,243","00:08:15,329",I'm Claire.
85,"00:08:15,412","00:08:17,414",I don't get it.
86,"00:08:17,497","00:08:18,957",What did I do?
87,"00:08:19,041","00:08:21,418",Ollie... he was her brother.
88,"00:08:23,128","00:08:24,963",He was her twin.
89,"00:08:26,215","00:08:28,800",The other half of her soul.
90,"00:08:30,677","00:08:31,887",Oh.
91,"00:08:48,070","00:08:50,614","Just because
you were number one once"
92,"00:08:50,697","00:08:52,616",does not mean you will be again.
93,"00:08:52,699","00:08:54,743",I will be number one.
94,"00:08:59,206","00:09:01,833","You are dismissed, rat."
95,"00:09:08,882","00:09:11,468",Two Americans?
96,"00:09:11,551","00:09:13,262",One too many.
97,"00:09:13,345","00:09:15,389",We won't have two for long.
98,"00:09:25,983","00:09:28,110","Your appearance today
was unacceptable."
99,"00:09:30,445","00:09:32,281","You're extra-large, right?"
100,"00:09:32,364","00:09:35,701","Let me see if I can find
something that big."
101,"00:09:47,462","00:09:49,381",That will be a hundred euros.
102,"00:09:49,464","00:09:52,092","- Well, I'm on scholarship.
- Yes."
103,"00:09:52,175","00:09:55,387","You have a scholarship
to attend as a foreign student."
104,"00:09:55,470","00:09:58,598","It does not include
the expenses."
105,"00:09:58,682","00:10:00,100",They didn't tell me that.
106,"00:10:02,477","00:10:04,229",Look.
107,"00:10:04,313","00:10:06,940","You can jump very high
and move very strong."
108,"00:10:07,024","00:10:09,192","This might make you
a sensation in America..."
109,"00:10:11,320","00:10:12,446",...but this is Paris.
110,"00:10:12,529","00:10:14,614",Romance traditionnelle.
111,"00:10:16,199","00:10:20,537","They want ballerinas
to be light and graceful."
112,"00:10:20,620","00:10:24,082","They want girls to be girls
and boys to be boys,"
113,"00:10:24,166","00:10:26,710","and if you don't fit
into that mold..."
114,"00:10:29,713","00:10:32,007","...they'll simply
find somebody who does."
115,"00:10:33,008","00:10:34,968","Trust me, I know."
116,"00:10:35,969","00:10:37,804","You're 18, yes?"
117,"00:10:38,972","00:10:40,974",Sign your consent here.
118,"00:10:42,893","00:10:46,021",And your mobile phone please.
119,"00:10:50,233","00:10:51,860",It's going well.
120,"00:10:51,943","00:10:53,570",Everyone's super French.
121,"00:10:53,653","00:10:55,155",Yeah.
122,"00:10:55,238","00:10:57,074",You making any friends?
123,"00:10:58,617","00:10:59,910",Uh... yeah.
124,"00:10:59,993","00:11:01,161",Yeah.
125,"00:11:01,244","00:11:03,872",People are... nice.
126,"00:11:03,955","00:11:06,625","Well, good. Good."
127,"00:11:08,251","00:11:10,504",Billy Elliot says bonjour.
128,"00:11:12,464","00:11:14,508","Bonjour, Billy."
129,"00:11:14,591","00:11:16,676","The house feels empty
without you."
130,"00:11:16,760","00:11:18,136",Well...
131,"00:11:18,220","00:11:21,640","Hey, at least now you get to,
you know, get some sleep."
132,"00:11:21,723","00:11:24,393","Not paying for my classes
and all that working so late."
133,"00:11:24,476","00:11:26,728","Ah, I always sleep well."
134,"00:11:26,812","00:11:28,230",Know why?
135,"00:11:30,065","00:11:32,317","I go to bed with
a clean conscience."
136,"00:11:32,401","00:11:34,528",You got that?
137,"00:11:34,611","00:11:35,737",Got it.
138,"00:11:35,821","00:11:38,907",Where do stars come from?
139,"00:11:38,990","00:11:41,243",Rebel's heart. Will of steel.
140,"00:11:41,326","00:11:43,245",Eyes set on true north.
141,"00:11:44,287","00:11:46,289","I love you, Little Bird."
142,"00:11:47,833","00:11:49,459","I love you, too, Dad."
143,"00:12:01,179","00:12:02,514",What are you doing here?
144,"00:12:02,597","00:12:04,057",I'm in my room.
145,"00:12:04,141","00:12:06,309","No one said anything to me
about a roommate."
146,"00:12:06,393","00:12:08,812","Well, this has been my room
since I was eight."
147,"00:12:08,895","00:12:11,106","- Look.
- Oh."
148,"00:12:12,149","00:12:13,859","Well, what are
we supposed to do?"
149,"00:12:13,942","00:12:15,402",There's only one bed.
150,"00:12:16,695","00:12:19,030","I know we got off
to kind of a rough start."
151,"00:12:19,114","00:12:22,075","I honestly had no idea, and I'm
really sorry about your brother."
152,"00:12:22,159","00:12:23,702",Okay? I really... didn't...
153,"00:12:59,905","00:13:01,265","Are you really gonna
smoke in here?"
154,"00:13:02,407","00:13:03,617",Yes.
155,"00:13:03,700","00:13:05,494",Okay.
156,"00:13:05,577","00:13:07,704",Isn't that against the rules?
157,"00:13:07,787","00:13:08,788",Yes.
158,"00:13:08,872","00:13:10,248",Do you always follow the rules?
159,"00:13:10,332","00:13:11,958",No.
160,"00:13:14,211","00:13:15,462",Prove it.
161,"00:13:28,225","00:13:29,559",20 euro.
162,"00:13:31,353","00:13:32,562",Twenty.
163,"00:13:54,751","00:13:56,086","Uh, no, thank you."
164,"00:13:56,169","00:13:58,922",No one enters without the worm.
165,"00:15:50,742","00:15:52,243",Want to play a game?
166,"00:15:53,411","00:15:55,038",Is she okay?
167,"00:15:56,748","00:16:00,043","Are you sure
this is a good idea?"
168,"00:16:00,126","00:16:02,003",She's a big girl.
169,"00:16:03,630","00:16:06,424",What kind of game?
170,"00:16:06,508","00:16:09,594","Whoever stops dancing first
drops out."
171,"00:16:10,595","00:16:13,264","- Of school?
- Yes."
172,"00:16:13,348","00:16:15,767",Of school.
173,"00:16:15,850","00:16:17,018",Oh.
174,"00:16:18,103","00:16:19,270",You in or not?
175,"00:16:22,774","00:16:23,942",I'm in.
176,"00:16:24,025","00:16:25,276",Good.
177,"00:17:25,754","00:17:27,589",My heart is on fire.
178,"00:17:28,715","00:17:30,091",I think I might die.
179,"00:17:30,175","00:17:31,968",You give up?
180,"00:17:33,011","00:17:34,554",Never.
181,"00:17:34,637","00:17:35,847",You?
182,"00:17:35,930","00:17:37,849",Fuck no.
183,"00:17:38,933","00:17:40,561",So what do we do?
184,"00:17:40,643","00:17:42,270",We keep dancing.
185,"00:17:44,189","00:17:45,774","- Fine.
- Fine."
186,"00:17:45,857","00:17:49,360","We could both stop
at the exact same moment."
187,"00:17:50,987","00:17:52,363",Nice try.
188,"00:17:52,447","00:17:53,865",What?
189,"00:17:53,948","00:17:56,117","You'll just tell me to stop
and then you'd let me stop."
190,"00:17:56,201","00:17:58,244",I would never do that.
191,"00:17:59,287","00:18:00,914",Why should I trust you?
192,"00:18:01,915","00:18:04,000",I'm gonna count to three.
193,"00:18:05,752","00:18:07,879",And we're gonna both stop
194,"00:18:07,962","00:18:11,174",exactly... at three.
195,"00:18:11,257","00:18:13,092",Not before.
196,"00:18:14,219","00:18:15,637",Not after.
197,"00:18:16,971","00:18:18,181",One.
198,"00:18:19,516","00:18:21,059",Two.
199,"00:18:23,645","00:18:25,355",Three.
200,"00:18:51,005","00:18:52,632",What about tomorrow?
201,"00:18:55,260","00:18:56,678",What about it?
202,"00:18:59,722","00:19:01,182",Are we friends?
203,"00:19:04,602","00:19:06,479",Tomorrow is tomorrow.
204,"00:19:43,057","00:19:45,393","- Hey.
- Hey."
205,"00:19:46,394","00:19:48,396",Why didn't you wake me?
206,"00:19:50,023","00:19:51,441",Set an alarm.
207,"00:19:58,281","00:19:59,866",What's that?
208,"00:19:59,949","00:20:02,410",It's for luck. A charm.
209,"00:20:02,493","00:20:04,704",Claire never dances without it.
210,"00:20:06,039","00:20:07,415",The pas de deux...
211,"00:20:08,708","00:20:13,254",...is chemistry made flesh.
212,"00:20:13,338","00:20:15,131",The heart of ballet.
213,"00:20:16,549","00:20:21,638","Dance is a ritual
of seduction, no?"
214,"00:20:21,721","00:20:23,848","Up, everybody."
215,"00:20:31,022","00:20:32,440",Felipe...
216,"00:20:33,608","00:20:36,027",...today you will pair with...
217,"00:20:46,788","00:20:48,289",...Claire.
218,"00:20:48,373","00:20:51,376","But, madame, I've been
his partner for three months."
219,"00:20:51,459","00:20:53,336",He wouldn't be able to lift you
220,"00:20:53,419","00:20:55,463","with all the weight you gained
over Christmas."
221,"00:20:56,589","00:20:58,132","Marine, Luc."
222,"00:20:58,216","00:21:00,134",And Virginia
223,"00:21:00,218","00:21:02,220",with... Jean Paul.
224,"00:21:27,537","00:21:29,080",Try to relax.
225,"00:21:29,163","00:21:30,581",I'm fine.
226,"00:21:35,336","00:21:37,630",I'm a drug dealer.
227,"00:21:37,714","00:21:40,258","If you need drugs,
I'll deal them to you."
228,"00:21:45,763","00:21:48,016","- Sorry.
- Heavy, Virginia."
229,"00:21:50,268","00:21:52,603",Light. Be light.
230,"00:21:53,688","00:21:55,440",And down.
231,"00:21:57,191","00:21:59,360","You look like a sack
of potatoes."
232,"00:22:07,577","00:22:09,954","Madame Brunelle
is just testing you."
233,"00:22:10,038","00:22:12,790","That's why we call her
Le Diable."
234,"00:22:12,874","00:22:14,584",She plays us off each other.
235,"00:22:14,667","00:22:17,378","Anyone who partners with Felipe
will be the better dancer."
236,"00:22:19,047","00:22:20,506",He's the key to the prize.
237,"00:22:22,216","00:22:24,927","She'll assign final partners
based on chemistry."
238,"00:22:26,971","00:22:29,682","In the meantime,
she's torturing me, too."
239,"00:22:29,766","00:22:32,685","Le diable obtient
ce qui lui est dû."
240,"00:22:32,769","00:22:33,895",What does that mean?
241,"00:22:33,978","00:22:36,105",The Devil gets her due.
242,"00:22:42,779","00:22:45,198",You're currently ranking last.
243,"00:22:45,281","00:22:47,075","I think it's better
to send you home now."
244,"00:22:47,158","00:22:48,659",No. I know I can do better.
245,"00:22:48,743","00:22:50,661","Let me tell you
something, Virginia."
246,"00:22:50,745","00:22:52,580",Kate.
247,"00:22:52,663","00:22:53,915",My name is Kate.
248,"00:22:53,998","00:22:55,541",And I can't go back.
249,"00:22:55,625","00:22:57,043","I've given up everything
to be here."
250,"00:22:57,126","00:22:59,504",Now we're getting somewhere.
251,"00:22:59,587","00:23:01,714","Let me tell you something, Kate."
252,"00:23:01,798","00:23:06,010","This rat was caught in one of
our traps in the basement."
253,"00:23:07,303","00:23:09,263",I never use wire traps.
254,"00:23:09,347","00:23:10,640",Do you know why?
255,"00:23:12,016","00:23:14,852","Tonight I plan to take it home
and feed it to my cat."
256,"00:23:14,936","00:23:17,021",She prefers her meat fresh.
257,"00:23:18,189","00:23:20,483","You just press this button here,"
258,"00:23:20,566","00:23:24,695","and it releases a gas
that gently..."
259,"00:23:24,779","00:23:26,989",puts the rat to death.
260,"00:23:27,073","00:23:29,283",Painless.
261,"00:23:29,367","00:23:30,535",Clean.
262,"00:23:30,618","00:23:31,786",I'm not a monster.
263,"00:23:34,789","00:23:36,165","If we don't get rid of the rats,"
264,"00:23:36,249","00:23:39,335","then the school will be overrun
and it will be worthless."
265,"00:23:39,418","00:23:42,088",Greatness has a price.
266,"00:23:42,171","00:23:43,881",Do you agree?
267,"00:23:46,134","00:23:47,552",Yes.
268,"00:23:48,970","00:23:49,971",Good.
269,"00:23:50,054","00:23:52,140",Then do the honors.
270,"00:23:56,269","00:23:58,146",You want me... to push the...
271,"00:23:58,229","00:24:00,439",Please. Push the button.
272,"00:24:02,441","00:24:06,195","Show me that you have
what it takes to win the prize."
273,"00:24:15,037","00:24:17,081","The devil pulled the rat trick
on Kate."
274,"00:24:17,165","00:24:18,416",Really?
275,"00:24:18,499","00:24:21,002","The button
is so obviously fake."
276,"00:24:21,085","00:24:23,254",I believed it.
277,"00:24:23,337","00:24:25,315","She brought Ollie and I into
her office when we were nine"
278,"00:24:25,339","00:24:26,883",and did the same thing.
279,"00:24:27,925","00:24:29,594","Which one of you
pushed the button?"
280,"00:24:29,677","00:24:30,928","Oh, neither of us."
281,"00:24:32,471","00:24:34,640",Don't tell me you pushed it.
282,"00:24:34,724","00:24:36,184",Of course not.
283,"00:24:38,644","00:24:40,563",76 euro?
284,"00:24:40,646","00:24:42,064",Such a rip off.
285,"00:24:42,148","00:24:44,901","They know we have to buy new
shoes each week. It's extortion."
286,"00:24:44,984","00:24:47,445","I bet the devil gets kickbacks
from this fucking store."
287,"00:24:47,528","00:24:49,447",Ballet Mafia.
288,"00:24:52,617","00:24:54,035",Aren't you getting any?
289,"00:24:54,118","00:24:55,828","Uh, no. My shoes are fine."
290,"00:24:55,912","00:24:57,914",M...
291,"00:25:35,451","00:25:37,651",Come over here.
292,"00:26:27,795","00:26:29,588",Are you okay?
293,"00:26:31,132","00:26:34,343","It's not easy competing with
a bunch of skinny white girls."
294,"00:26:34,427","00:26:37,346","For me, every little mistake
gets noticed."
295,"00:26:37,430","00:26:40,599","I have to dance miracles
just to be the exception."
296,"00:26:42,476","00:26:44,603",I do what it takes.
297,"00:26:47,565","00:26:49,233",Good luck with your shoes.
298,"00:27:29,440","00:27:30,440",Oh.
299,"00:27:30,441","00:27:32,319","- Oh.
- Sorry."
300,"00:27:33,652","00:27:35,946","Um, I was wondering, um,"
301,"00:27:36,030","00:27:38,115",if maybe...
302,"00:27:38,199","00:27:40,201","you could dance with me
sometime."
303,"00:27:41,786","00:27:44,121","I know I'm, like, really tall,
but you're tall"
304,"00:27:44,205","00:27:47,291","and appear strong and...
I don't know."
305,"00:27:47,375","00:27:51,128","Um, maybe you could help me
with some stuff."
306,"00:27:51,212","00:27:52,880",Like partnering and stuff.
307,"00:27:57,218","00:27:59,470",Okay. Come in.
308,"00:28:00,805","00:28:02,473",Like right now?
309,"00:28:09,897","00:28:11,440","Okay, lay down."
310,"00:28:14,902","00:28:16,320",Do you want my help?
311,"00:28:40,719","00:28:42,346",Keep your hips even.
312,"00:28:43,848","00:28:45,683",Floating.
313,"00:28:50,896","00:28:54,650","To be a star
you have to be soft."
314,"00:29:00,156","00:29:02,158",Your form is very strict.
315,"00:29:02,241","00:29:04,034",Very controlled.
316,"00:29:10,749","00:29:13,586","Okay, so get up
and à la seconde."
317,"00:29:20,092","00:29:23,095",Arabesque and face the door.
318,"00:29:27,433","00:29:29,602","Ballet is precision
and perfection."
319,"00:29:31,187","00:29:33,522","But so what?
Nobody pays to see perfection."
320,"00:29:35,941","00:29:37,693",They pay to see romance.
321,"00:29:38,861","00:29:40,905","Desire, dominance."
322,"00:29:40,988","00:29:42,865",Bodies touching bodies.
323,"00:29:44,950","00:29:47,286","What makes a perfect
prima ballerina"
324,"00:29:47,369","00:29:49,371",is total submission.
325,"00:29:51,248","00:29:53,417",Allow yourself to be possessed.
326,"00:30:02,468","00:30:03,886","Okay, fall back."
327,"00:30:07,306","00:30:09,600",No thinking. Breathe.
328,"00:30:13,229","00:30:14,647",You're beautiful.
329,"00:31:06,907","00:31:08,659",Is something wrong?
330,"00:31:10,911","00:31:12,705",Don't tell M.
331,"00:31:22,548","00:31:24,883",Where are you going?
332,"00:31:24,967","00:31:26,427",Embassy party.
333,"00:31:26,510","00:31:27,970",That's cool.
334,"00:31:28,053","00:31:29,447","I'd skip it, but I have to go."
335,"00:31:29,471","00:31:31,390",I'm the ambassador's daughter.
336,"00:31:31,473","00:31:33,225",Which ambassador?
337,"00:31:33,309","00:31:35,561",The American ambassador.
338,"00:31:35,644","00:31:38,772","Your dad is the
American ambassador to France?"
339,"00:31:38,856","00:31:42,151","My mom is
the American ambassador."
340,"00:31:42,234","00:31:43,652",How come you never told me this?
341,"00:31:43,736","00:31:45,237",It never came up.
342,"00:31:46,238","00:31:48,657",What does your dad do?
343,"00:31:48,741","00:31:49,908",Businessman.
344,"00:31:49,992","00:31:52,119","We should talk about
gender expectations."
345,"00:31:53,162","00:31:54,997",What type of businessman?
346,"00:31:55,080","00:31:56,290",Mostly milks.
347,"00:31:58,459","00:32:00,044",Why is that funny?
348,"00:32:00,127","00:32:01,837",Milks?
349,"00:32:01,920","00:32:06,467","Macadamia, soy, coconut,
almond, cashews."
350,"00:32:07,968","00:32:09,303",Squeezable nuts.
351,"00:32:10,387","00:32:11,972","Your mom is
the American ambassador"
352,"00:32:12,056","00:32:14,642","and your dad is
a nut milk tycoon."
353,"00:32:14,725","00:32:16,560",So?
354,"00:32:16,644","00:32:19,605","My dad pours concrete
in Wakefield."
355,"00:32:19,688","00:32:21,398",What about your mom?
356,"00:32:21,482","00:32:23,525",It's just me and my dad.
357,"00:32:23,609","00:32:25,277",It's nothing.
358,"00:32:25,361","00:32:27,446",That one's nice.
359,"00:32:27,529","00:32:29,031","Will you help me
with the buttons?"
360,"00:32:29,114","00:32:30,324",Sure.
361,"00:32:38,666","00:32:41,335",What does this mean?
362,"00:32:41,418","00:32:42,836","""Never mind."""
363,"00:32:43,879","00:32:44,880",Okay.
364,"00:32:44,963","00:32:47,424","No, it-it means..."
365,"00:32:47,508","00:32:49,134","""never mind."""
366,"00:32:49,218","00:32:51,011",Oh.
367,"00:32:51,095","00:32:52,346",Ça ne fait rien.
368,"00:32:53,347","00:32:55,057",I like it.
369,"00:32:55,140","00:32:57,643","You never answered my question
about your mom."
370,"00:32:57,726","00:32:59,103","She was a dancer, actually."
371,"00:33:01,105","00:33:02,856",Yeah.
372,"00:33:07,486","00:33:10,155",She died when I was little.
373,"00:33:10,239","00:33:11,740",She's beautiful.
374,"00:33:11,824","00:33:13,075",Yeah.
375,"00:33:15,786","00:33:17,579","My dad refuses
to talk about her."
376,"00:33:18,997","00:33:21,041",I think it hurts too much.
377,"00:33:22,918","00:33:26,088","But when I quit basketball
and started dancing..."
378,"00:33:27,297","00:33:28,924",...I could tell it meant a lot.
379,"00:33:30,217","00:33:31,885","It's stupid, but, um..."
380,"00:33:34,346","00:33:36,682",...when I dance...
381,"00:33:36,765","00:33:38,809",it feels like...
382,"00:33:38,892","00:33:40,936",I can feel her.
383,"00:33:41,019","00:33:42,563",You know? Like she's with me.
384,"00:33:58,704","00:34:00,622","""How are your classes?"""
385,"00:34:00,706","00:34:02,040","Oh, they're-they're good."

387,"00:34:04,126","00:34:06,170","Well, my roommate...
she's American."
388,"00:34:06,253","00:34:07,463","- She's fun.
- E-Enough."
389,"00:34:11,175","00:34:12,760",Katherine Sanders.
390,"00:34:14,803","00:34:16,513",You know her?
391,"00:34:16,597","00:34:18,974","She's the recipient of
the scholarship we established"
392,"00:34:19,057","00:34:20,392",in your brother's honor.
393,"00:34:21,435","00:34:23,270",How come you-you didn't tell me?
394,"00:34:23,353","00:34:24,813","I hear she may be
sent home soon."
395,"00:34:24,897","00:34:26,607","Can't you just talk
to the school?"
396,"00:34:26,690","00:34:28,442","Isn't she supposed to be
your competition?"
397,"00:34:28,525","00:34:30,277","If we'd known they were
gonna give the money"
398,"00:34:30,360","00:34:33,238","to a female dancer, we would
never have sent the check."
399,"00:34:33,322","00:34:34,948",She's my friend.
400,"00:34:35,032","00:34:36,617","Boundaries, Marine."
401,"00:35:04,436","00:35:07,147","Marine, can I see you please?"
402,"00:35:08,482","00:35:12,152","Your daughter is
quite... fascinating."
403,"00:35:12,236","00:35:14,238",Spirited.
404,"00:35:15,781","00:35:17,199","You'll excuse me, I'm sure."
405,"00:35:19,618","00:35:21,036",What is this?
406,"00:35:22,120","00:35:24,039","Oh, this, uh..."
407,"00:35:24,122","00:35:25,749","this charade
you invited me to perform"
408,"00:35:25,833","00:35:27,751","where we pretend to be
a happy family."
409,"00:35:27,835","00:35:30,462",You listen to me very carefully.
410,"00:35:30,546","00:35:33,131","Tonight is not an obligation
which is subject to your moods."
411,"00:35:33,215","00:35:35,467","Look at you, Marine."
412,"00:35:35,551","00:35:38,095","Ambassador Durand,
your daughter has grown."
413,"00:35:38,178","00:35:40,430",Just about.
414,"00:35:40,514","00:35:42,516","Oh, Marine is
quite the dancer now."
415,"00:35:42,599","00:35:46,061","She's on track to join
the Paris Opera Ballet."
416,"00:35:46,144","00:35:47,813","- If all goes well.
- Wow."
417,"00:35:47,896","00:35:50,732","Well, we'd love
to see you dance sometime."
418,"00:35:50,816","00:35:53,652",I'm sure she'd be happy to.
419,"00:35:53,735","00:35:55,279","N'est-ce pas, Marine?"
420,"00:35:56,321","00:35:57,489",Sure.
421,"00:36:54,129","00:36:56,048",For your bloody feet.
422,"00:36:56,131","00:36:57,591","I'd offer to wash them for you,"
423,"00:36:57,674","00:36:59,885","but I think that might sound
a little creepy."
424,"00:37:01,136","00:37:02,262",A little?
425,"00:37:02,346","00:37:04,473",S-Sorry. That was so dumb.
426,"00:37:04,556","00:37:07,517","- I'll leave you alone.
- No, no, I, uh..."
427,"00:37:09,561","00:37:13,523","I just don't let boys
look at or touch my feet."
428,"00:37:13,607","00:37:15,567",It's a dancer thing.
429,"00:37:15,651","00:37:18,111","And I strongly prefer
women in socks."
430,"00:37:18,195","00:37:19,613",It's a drummer thing.
431,"00:37:20,864","00:37:22,282",My name's Jamal.
432,"00:37:24,368","00:37:25,577",M.
433,"00:37:26,745","00:37:28,163",Just M?
434,"00:37:31,208","00:37:34,127","Short for Marine,
but I never liked that."
435,"00:37:37,381","00:37:39,424","My brother used to call me
Marionette."
436,"00:37:40,801","00:37:42,177",Like the puppet.
437,"00:37:44,638","00:37:48,225","And so... should I call you
Marionette?"
438,"00:37:51,687","00:37:53,105",Close your eyes.
439,"00:38:01,196","00:38:02,948",Do they hurt?
440,"00:38:03,031","00:38:05,450","Let me tell you a
little secret about ballerinas."
441,"00:38:07,244","00:38:08,912",We are warriors of pain.
442,"00:38:08,996","00:38:11,206","Oh, shit."
443,"00:38:13,208","00:38:14,835",Why do you do it?
444,"00:38:19,965","00:38:22,592","Because if I stop, then, um..."
445,"00:38:22,676","00:38:24,970",someone I love will be gone.
446,"00:38:29,933","00:38:31,351",Your brother?
447,"00:38:32,978","00:38:35,397","It was always supposed to be
the two of us."
448,"00:38:37,816","00:38:40,694","My mom put us in ballet class
as soon as we could walk."
449,"00:38:42,863","00:38:44,281",It's who I am.
450,"00:38:47,951","00:38:50,037","You must think
I'm really fucked-up."
451,"00:38:52,497","00:38:53,874",I think you're sad.
452,"00:38:55,667","00:38:57,085",And funny.
453,"00:38:58,628","00:39:00,172",And a very good dancer.
454,"00:39:05,510","00:39:07,012",Are you with an embassy?
455,"00:39:07,095","00:39:08,221","No, I..."
456,"00:39:08,305","00:39:10,557",I'm with the band.
457,"00:39:10,640","00:39:12,243","Well, that's good because, uh..."
458,"00:39:12,267","00:39:14,936",um...
459,"00:39:15,020","00:39:16,563","then we won't
see each other again,"
460,"00:39:16,646","00:39:19,316",and we can just pretend this...
461,"00:39:19,399","00:39:20,817",never happened.
462,"00:39:22,611","00:39:25,530","The problem is
I want to see you again."
463,"00:39:28,450","00:39:29,993",That's a bad idea.
464,"00:39:30,994","00:39:32,621",I have poor judgment.
465,"00:39:35,123","00:39:37,084",I don't have any time.
466,"00:39:37,167","00:39:39,169",Then we better move fast.
467,"00:39:46,510","00:39:47,886",Scott Sanders.
468,"00:39:47,969","00:39:49,638",You know what to do.
469,"00:39:49,721","00:39:51,223","Hey, Dad."
470,"00:39:51,306","00:39:52,808",Sorry I keep missing your calls.
471,"00:39:52,891","00:39:55,936","Um, everything's good here."
472,"00:39:56,019","00:39:58,188",Things are going really well.
473,"00:39:58,271","00:39:59,523",Yeah.
474,"00:39:59,606","00:40:01,525",I love you.
475,"00:40:08,865","00:40:10,117",Hey.
476,"00:40:11,118","00:40:12,369",Hey.
477,"00:40:13,995","00:40:15,413",How was it?
478,"00:40:18,750","00:40:21,545","I acted out,
as my therapist would say."
479,"00:40:21,628","00:40:23,046",Mm.
480,"00:40:25,632","00:40:26,842",What's wrong?
481,"00:40:30,679","00:40:32,347","I just keep thinking about
this story"
482,"00:40:32,430","00:40:35,433","my dad used to tell me
when I was a kid."
483,"00:40:35,517","00:40:38,353",I was afraid of the dark.
484,"00:40:38,436","00:40:40,063",Will you tell it to me?
485,"00:40:41,189","00:40:42,983",You really want to hear it?
486,"00:40:44,401","00:40:45,944",Okay.
487,"00:40:46,945","00:40:49,823",The animals were behaving badly.
488,"00:40:51,032","00:40:53,451","So the gods decided
to cover the entire Earth"
489,"00:40:53,535","00:40:56,079","with a blanket,
blocking out the sun."
490,"00:40:57,122","00:40:58,999",It was so dark.
491,"00:40:59,082","00:41:01,376",So dark.
492,"00:41:01,459","00:41:04,212",The animals were afraid.
493,"00:41:04,296","00:41:06,631","But the gods did not answer
their prayers."
494,"00:41:08,466","00:41:10,343",But then...
495,"00:41:10,427","00:41:13,847",this one brave little bird
496,"00:41:13,930","00:41:15,765",flew up to the sky.
497,"00:41:16,808","00:41:18,310",Faster and faster.
498,"00:41:19,811","00:41:23,356","Her heart was beating so fast
she thought it might burst."
499,"00:41:25,358","00:41:26,985",But she just kept going.
500,"00:41:29,946","00:41:31,364",Rebel's heart.
501,"00:41:32,657","00:41:34,242",Will of steel.
502,"00:41:36,203","00:41:38,413",Eyes set on true north.
503,"00:41:42,709","00:41:44,502",Until finally...
504,"00:41:46,046","00:41:49,049","...she pierced the blanket
with her beak,"
505,"00:41:49,132","00:41:51,551","and a tiny ray of light
shone through."
506,"00:41:54,095","00:41:56,932",The little bird flew back up
507,"00:41:57,015","00:41:59,267","again and again,"
508,"00:41:59,351","00:42:02,103","poking holes in the blanket,"
509,"00:42:02,187","00:42:04,773",defying the will of the gods.
510,"00:42:06,441","00:42:08,526",But the gods were not mad.
511,"00:42:10,111","00:42:13,615","The gods were so moved
by her courage"
512,"00:42:13,698","00:42:15,738","they decided they were
only going to cover the Earth"
513,"00:42:15,784","00:42:17,619",for half of the day.
514,"00:42:19,246","00:42:22,791","And so, this blanket,"
515,"00:42:22,874","00:42:26,044",full of these tiny holes
516,"00:42:26,127","00:42:27,837",became the night sky.
517,"00:42:34,010","00:42:36,304","And that's how
the stars were formed."
518,"00:42:53,530","00:42:55,949",I don't want to win if...
519,"00:42:56,032","00:42:57,867",if it means you lose.
520,"00:43:06,084","00:43:08,086",I'll help you.
521,"00:43:11,631","00:43:13,633",And we'll both dance so well...
522,"00:43:15,010","00:43:16,636",...they won't have a choice.
523,"00:43:17,929","00:43:20,140","And they'll have to
make an exception."
524,"00:43:21,766","00:43:25,186",And we'll both get the prize.
525,"00:43:28,231","00:43:29,733",I like that.
526,"00:43:35,447","00:43:37,073",Give me your earring.
527,"00:43:47,500","00:43:49,753","- Is this real?
- Mm-hmm."
528,"00:43:49,836","00:43:51,963","- I can't take this.
- I don't care. Come on."
529,"00:44:09,272","00:44:10,732",Let's make a pact.
530,"00:44:18,490","00:44:19,908",Repeat after me.
531,"00:44:21,201","00:44:24,412","- This is our sacred oath.
- This is our sacred oath."
532,"00:44:24,496","00:44:26,206","To always be there
for each other."
533,"00:44:26,289","00:44:27,916","To always be
there for each other."
534,"00:44:27,999","00:44:31,586","To help each other out
every step of the way."
535,"00:44:31,669","00:44:33,797","To help each other
out every step of the way."
536,"00:44:35,131","00:44:37,884",And to win the prize together...
537,"00:44:37,967","00:44:39,302",or not at all.
538,"00:44:42,764","00:44:45,100",And to win the prize together...
539,"00:44:45,183","00:44:46,684",or not at all.

546,"00:45:21,344","00:45:22,696","What were you and Gia
talking about?"
547,"00:45:22,720","00:45:24,139","Oh, nothing."
548,"00:45:26,015","00:45:28,476","She's still pissed at me

552,"00:45:34,607","00:45:36,359","- The drummer?
- Mm-hmm."
553,"00:45:39,863","00:45:42,532",I see the way you look at her.

Who does she think she is?"
570,"00:46:34,876","00:46:36,169",Stop.
571,"00:46:38,755","00:46:39,881",I'm sorry.
572,"00:46:39,964","00:46:42,717","I wanted to show you
my own ideas."
573,"00:46:42,800","00:46:44,594",I can see that.

576,"00:46:54,771","00:46:56,314",What happened?
577,"00:46:56,397","00:46:58,233",Just until your rank goes up.
578,"00:46:59,234","00:47:00,818",I meant what I said.
579,"00:47:00,902","00:47:02,820",Both of us or none at all.
580,"00:47:05,073","00:47:06,449","Claire, à toi."
581,"00:47:06,533","00:47:07,992",What's wrong?
582,"00:47:08,076","00:47:09,494",My ribbon... I can't find it.
583,"00:47:09,577","00:47:10,870",Her ribbon.
584,"00:47:10,954","00:47:13,706",Don't panic. We'll help find it.
585,"00:47:16,292","00:47:17,353","Are you sure
you checked in your bag?"
586,"00:47:17,377","00:47:18,586",Of course I looked there!
587,"00:47:18,670","00:47:20,380","Well, check again."
588,"00:47:22,632","00:47:24,926","Claire,
we won't wait any longer."
589,"00:47:25,009","00:47:26,344",Look at me.
590,"00:47:26,427","00:47:28,197","You are a great dancer,
with or without your ribbon."
591,"00:47:28,221","00:47:29,847",Go.
592,"00:47:31,599","00:47:32,892",I know it was you.
593,"00:47:35,103","00:47:36,604",What did she say?
594,"00:47:36,688","00:47:38,064",Nothing.
595,"00:47:42,110","00:47:44,404","Why have you not come
to see me, Marionette?"
596,"00:47:44,487","00:47:46,447","- Don't call me that.
- Why not?"
597,"00:47:46,531","00:47:47,657",You know why.
598,"00:48:01,879","00:48:04,007",Dead rats.

600,"00:48:27,113","00:48:29,324","Hello, American girl."
601,"00:48:29,407","00:48:31,034",I knew you would come to see me.
602,"00:48:32,493","00:48:35,079","Pink's for up
and blue's for down."
603,"00:48:38,082","00:48:39,584",I don't need drugs to dance.
604,"00:48:39,667","00:48:41,169","Well, you are the exception."
605,"00:48:41,252","00:48:42,795",Everyone else does.
606,"00:48:42,879","00:48:45,256",You can ask your friend M.
607,"00:48:45,340","00:48:47,967","She hasn't come to see me
since she's back."
608,"00:48:48,051","00:48:50,678","That's why her rank
is not as good as before."
609,"00:48:51,721","00:48:54,599","Hey, there's no testing
in ballet."
610,"00:48:54,682","00:48:56,893","No one will ask you
to pee in a cup."

640,"00:51:32,757","00:51:34,175",Says who?
641,"00:51:36,385","00:51:38,221",You make me happy.
642,"00:51:40,932","00:51:42,558",It's dangerous.
643,"00:51:45,561","00:51:46,979",You're right.
644,"00:51:48,105","00:51:50,525",I am very dangerous.
645,"00:51:50,608","00:51:52,044","What are you doing?
What are you..."
646,"00:51:52,068","00:51:54,445","Ah, wait. Wait, wait, wait."
647,"00:51:54,529","00:51:56,197",I'm not gonna look.
648,"00:51:56,280","00:51:58,032","I won't look, I promise."
649,"00:51:58,115","00:52:00,117",I just want to...
650,"00:52:02,578","00:52:04,247",You can look.
651,"00:52:20,137","00:52:24,350","These feet belong to a dancer,
not a marionette."
652,"00:52:24,433","00:52:26,811","There's more to you
than just ballet."
653,"00:52:26,894","00:52:28,104",I've seen it.
654,"00:52:29,438","00:52:31,691","You're an artist, not a puppet."
655,"00:52:36,696","00:52:38,030",Shoulders down.
656,"00:52:44,495","00:52:46,914",Look at you. That's good.
657,"00:52:46,998","00:52:48,624",Come closer.
658,"00:52:51,961","00:52:53,880",I'm finally up to number two.
659,"00:52:53,963","00:52:55,965","And Madame Brunelle,
the one who doesn't like me,"
660,"00:52:56,048","00:52:58,277","well, she finally paired me with
the best dancer in the school."
661,"00:52:58,301","00:52:59,719",She saw we have chemistry
662,"00:52:59,802","00:53:02,805","and, well,
we're basically unstoppable."
663,"00:53:02,889","00:53:05,558","You do your best.
You do the right thing."
664,"00:53:05,641","00:53:07,435",That's all I care about.
665,"00:53:07,518","00:53:10,396","Katie, I've got to
tell you something."
666,"00:53:10,479","00:53:11,606",What?
667,"00:53:11,689","00:53:14,233","I moved into an apartment
closer to town."
668,"00:53:16,027","00:53:17,695",What about the house?
669,"00:53:17,778","00:53:19,530",I sold it.
670,"00:53:19,614","00:53:21,449",You sold our house?
671,"00:53:21,532","00:53:23,910",Without telling me?
672,"00:53:23,993","00:53:26,412",I didn't want to upset you.
673,"00:53:26,495","00:53:28,664","We both got a lot
to worry about, Kate."
674,"00:53:28,748","00:53:31,959","The house, the dog...
it's a lot for me, okay?"
675,"00:53:32,043","00:53:35,463","Well, I guess
I better win, right?"
676,"00:53:35,546","00:53:37,965","It's not like there's any home
to come back to."
677,"00:53:46,891","00:53:48,559","- Hey.
- Hey."
678,"00:53:53,064","00:53:55,483","Do you have something
you want to tell me?"
679,"00:53:57,318","00:53:59,946","Mm, what do you mean?"
680,"00:54:00,029","00:54:02,281",Why do you have Claire's ribbon?
681,"00:54:09,664","00:54:11,666","I saw it on the ground, and I..."
682,"00:54:14,335","00:54:16,337",...I just...
683,"00:54:16,420","00:54:17,838",picked it up.
684,"00:54:19,966","00:54:22,343","I was going to give it
back to her."
685,"00:54:24,136","00:54:27,348","She just got so upset; I didn't
want her to think I stole it."
686,"00:54:29,767","00:54:31,852","You should have
said something to me."
687,"00:54:33,354","00:54:34,855",I know.
688,"00:54:36,399","00:54:37,608",I'm sorry.
689,"00:54:46,325","00:54:48,327","I didn't mean
for her to get hurt."
690,"00:54:56,752","00:54:58,754","It's the worst thing
I've ever done."
691,"00:55:03,801","00:55:05,636",Are you gonna turn me in?
692,"00:55:13,477","00:55:15,479","I'm sorry
I went through your bag."
693,"00:55:16,939","00:55:18,441",It's fine.
694,"00:55:18,524","00:55:20,776",I thought you were taking pills.
695,"00:55:23,821","00:55:25,990",You seem on edge lately.
696,"00:55:26,073","00:55:27,908",And I know what that's like.
697,"00:55:37,126","00:55:40,755","I had a dream about
the story you told me."
698,"00:55:40,838","00:55:42,465",About the little bird.
699,"00:55:44,592","00:55:47,178",She fell from the sky.
700,"00:55:47,261","00:55:49,138",Her body was broken.
701,"00:55:50,431","00:55:52,433",She was in so much pain.
702,"00:55:55,102","00:55:57,146",But then another bird appeared.
703,"00:56:00,357","00:56:02,276",She helped her fly again.
704,"00:56:24,465","00:56:26,842",That's going to be you one day.
705,"00:57:01,377","00:57:04,004","Giselle, my love!"
706,"00:57:04,088","00:57:06,173","- Don't go.
- I must leave you."
707,"00:57:06,257","00:57:08,175","My heart will ache
for all of eternity!"
708,"00:57:09,468","00:57:11,762",Shut the fuck up!
709,"00:57:11,846","00:57:13,406",People are trying to sleep!
710,"00:57:13,430","00:57:15,057",Sorry!
711,"00:57:15,891","00:57:17,143",Sorry!
712,"00:57:18,727","00:57:21,480","Good night, Gia. Sleep well."
713,"00:57:21,564","00:57:23,190","Sleep well, Gia."
714,"00:57:23,274","00:57:24,692",Fuck off!
715,"00:57:24,775","00:57:26,443","- I have an idea.
- What?"
716,"00:57:27,653","00:57:29,697","- You have a phone?
- I gave them a burner."
717,"00:57:29,780","00:57:31,407","- Come here.
- Ah, genius."
718,"00:57:39,498","00:57:41,750",What? What are you doing?
719,"00:57:41,834","00:57:43,752","Wait, is that Benjamin Benjamin?"
720,"00:57:43,836","00:57:45,880","Like, Benjamin,
star of the ballet"
721,"00:57:45,963","00:57:48,424","- that we just saw, Benjamin?
- Mm-hmm."
722,"00:57:48,507","00:57:49,717",Holy fuck.
723,"00:57:51,385","00:57:53,804","Oh, my God, he's typing."
724,"00:57:53,888","00:57:55,014",Come on.
725,"00:57:55,097","00:57:56,223","Oh, we see you."
726,"00:57:56,307","00:57:58,350",We know you're there.
727,"00:57:59,685","00:58:01,204","- Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
- Be cool."
728,"00:58:01,228","00:58:02,414","Oh, my God.
Oh, my God. Oh, my God."
729,"00:58:02,438","00:58:04,773",Hi there. Do I know you?
730,"00:58:04,857","00:58:05,983",You look familiar.
731,"00:58:06,066","00:58:07,193",You need a hint?
732,"00:58:07,276","00:58:08,736",You're the Durand daughter.
733,"00:58:08,819","00:58:10,487","""The Durand daughter."""
734,"00:58:10,571","00:58:12,573",This is my friend Kate.
735,"00:58:12,656","00:58:14,366","She dances at the academy
with me."
736,"00:58:14,450","00:58:16,327","Hi. Uh, Kate."
737,"00:58:16,410","00:58:17,536",You were amazing.
738,"00:58:17,620","00:58:19,246","I can't believe
I'm talking to you."
739,"00:58:19,330","00:58:21,332","Benjamin, are you
going to be the judge"
740,"00:58:21,415","00:58:23,417","- for the prize again this year?
- Yes, I am."
741,"00:58:23,500","00:58:26,003",Have two girls ever won before?
742,"00:58:26,086","00:58:27,713",Nope. Tradition.
743,"00:58:27,796","00:58:30,090","And traditions are
meant to be broken."
744,"00:58:30,174","00:58:31,383",You never know.
745,"00:58:34,011","00:58:36,096","- Good night, girls.
- Good night."
746,"00:58:36,180","00:58:37,973",Bonne nuit.
747,"00:58:39,391","00:58:40,893","How do you have
his phone number?"
748,"00:58:43,395","00:58:45,231",He'll be here in a moment.
749,"00:58:50,152","00:58:52,363","Have they assigned
final partners?"
750,"00:58:56,242","00:58:57,409",Not yet.
751,"00:58:58,869","00:59:00,931","We think they'll announce it
in the next couple of weeks"
752,"00:59:00,955","00:59:03,666","once they've narrowed it down
to the top five."
753,"00:59:03,749","00:59:05,584",Will Marine make the cut?
754,"00:59:05,668","00:59:07,503",I hear she's right on the edge.
755,"00:59:07,586","00:59:10,047",Of course she will.
756,"00:59:10,130","00:59:13,217","When Marine danced with Ollie,
they were always number one."
757,"00:59:15,261","00:59:17,263","Ollie would've been
the next Nureyev."
758,"00:59:17,346","00:59:19,640","- He was that good.
- He wasn't the next Nureyev."
759,"00:59:19,723","00:59:21,558",How would you know?
760,"00:59:21,642","00:59:23,411","You're not even on track
to be the next member"
761,"00:59:23,435","00:59:25,312",of the corps de ballet.
762,"00:59:25,396","00:59:27,022",I don't feel well.
763,"00:59:34,863","00:59:38,534","I wanted to say thank you
for the scholarship."
764,"00:59:38,617","00:59:40,869","I know it's supposed
to be anonymous,"
765,"00:59:40,953","00:59:42,830","so I wasn't
going to say anything."
766,"00:59:42,913","00:59:44,581",Um...
767,"00:59:44,665","00:59:46,292",but M told me.
768,"00:59:48,002","00:59:49,920",It means everything.
769,"00:59:52,423","00:59:55,509","I just wanted to say
it means even more to me"
770,"00:59:55,592","00:59:58,637","to know that
it's in Ollie's name."
771,"00:59:59,680","01:00:01,640",I know how close he and M were.
772,"01:00:01,724","01:00:03,350",Yes.
773,"01:00:05,728","01:00:07,563",But now she has you.
774,"01:01:24,348","01:01:27,351",This is our sacred oath.
775,"01:01:27,434","01:01:30,354","To always be there
for each other."
776,"01:01:30,437","01:01:33,357","To help each other
every step of the way."
777,"01:01:33,440","01:01:36,860","To win the prize together
or not at all."
778,"01:02:17,526","01:02:19,278",She hates me.
779,"01:02:19,361","01:02:20,988",No.
780,"01:02:22,990","01:02:25,159",I don't blame her.
781,"01:02:29,663","01:02:31,498",It was my fault.
782,"01:02:33,500","01:02:35,919","- It wasn't your fault.
- You don't know that."
783,"01:02:44,219","01:02:47,055",Ollie and I... we were like...
784,"01:02:47,139","01:02:48,932",the same person.
785,"01:02:54,021","01:02:55,522",My mom...
786,"01:03:01,820","01:03:03,030",What?
787,"01:03:05,365","01:03:06,575",Hey.
788,"01:03:07,951","01:03:09,953",You can tell me anything.
789,"01:03:11,371","01:03:12,706",Anything.
790,"01:03:13,749","01:03:15,334",I promise.
791,"01:03:28,096","01:03:30,933",We were home on summer holiday.
792,"01:03:32,851","01:03:34,311",Ollie and I.
793,"01:03:36,897","01:03:39,316","We were just rehearsing
in the living room."
794,"01:03:43,320","01:03:45,239","We'd moved all the furniture
to the side"
795,"01:03:45,322","01:03:47,533","like we used to do
when we were little."
796,"01:03:54,456","01:03:55,916","And she, um..."
797,"01:04:00,128","01:04:01,838",She walked in.
798,"01:04:01,922","01:04:03,715",We didn't know she was home.
799,"01:04:05,676","01:04:08,303",And she screamed.
800,"01:04:08,387","01:04:09,805",So loud.
801,"01:04:11,181","01:04:13,725",And she pulled us apart...
802,"01:04:13,809","01:04:15,811",and she slapped me.
803,"01:04:22,442","01:04:24,361","And then she told my dad
what she saw..."
804,"01:04:24,444","01:04:26,446",what she thought she saw.
805,"01:04:27,906","01:04:29,908",He didn't believe her.
806,"01:04:34,121","01:04:36,582",She wouldn't listen to anyone.
807,"01:04:39,001","01:04:41,503","We were just dancing, but..."
808,"01:04:43,297","01:04:46,967","...my mom couldn't look at
either of us after that."
809,"01:04:52,431","01:04:53,640",Ollie...
810,"01:04:58,186","01:04:59,521",...he...
811,"01:05:02,024","01:05:03,817",...he... we'd...
812,"01:05:03,900","01:05:06,695",we had taken pills to dance.
813,"01:05:08,196","01:05:10,532","But after that, he just..."
814,"01:05:10,616","01:05:12,784",he started taking everything.
815,"01:05:12,868","01:05:14,870",Whatever he could find.
816,"01:05:19,374","01:05:21,376",And the night it happened...
817,"01:05:24,004","01:05:25,631",...he called me.
818,"01:05:28,258","01:05:32,054","And I d...
I d... I didn't answer."
819,"01:05:32,137","01:05:34,848",I didn't answer.
820,"01:05:34,931","01:05:37,251",What happened to our promise?
821,"01:05:37,934","01:05:39,853","Never mind, right?"
822,"01:05:39,936","01:05:41,647",Okay. Never mind.
823,"01:05:44,191","01:05:45,400",Ça ne fait rien.
824,"01:05:51,448","01:05:53,450",What happened to our promise?
825,"01:05:54,493","01:05:56,536","Never mind, right?"
826,"01:05:56,620","01:05:58,455",Okay. Never mind.
827,"01:06:00,832","01:06:02,209",Ça ne fait rien.
828,"01:06:08,173","01:06:10,926","I have something
to tell you, too."
829,"01:06:12,427","01:06:13,804",I already know.
830,"01:06:16,932","01:06:18,517",You do?
831,"01:06:22,229","01:06:23,939",Felipe told me.
832,"01:06:24,022","01:06:26,441","Thought it would
make me jealous."
833,"01:06:30,821","01:06:32,322",Were you?
834,"01:06:33,865","01:06:35,283",At first.
835,"01:06:38,036","01:06:40,414",And then I realized
836,"01:06:40,497","01:06:43,667","it wasn't because
you were with Felipe, but..."
837,"01:06:45,419","01:06:47,587",...because Felipe was with you.
838,"01:06:58,849","01:07:00,851",He thinks he has all the power.
839,"01:07:08,233","01:07:10,235",That we're all in love with him.
840,"01:08:14,549","01:08:17,052","I just want to know
what it feels like."
841,"01:08:18,595","01:08:19,805",What?
842,"01:08:21,681","01:08:23,308",To be you.
843,"01:09:03,598","01:09:04,808",Hi.
844,"01:09:08,812","01:09:10,021",Hi.
845,"01:09:11,481","01:09:13,775",What are you doing here?
846,"01:09:13,859","01:09:15,610",I don't know.
847,"01:09:15,694","01:09:17,821","You just stopped
answering my calls."
848,"01:09:19,364","01:09:21,908","And now I kind of
feel like a stalker."
849,"01:09:21,992","01:09:24,244",Maybe you are one.
850,"01:09:25,912","01:09:27,789",So that's it?
851,"01:09:31,501","01:09:33,128",I went by your house.
852,"01:09:34,462","01:09:37,173","I didn't know
how else to contact you."
853,"01:09:37,257","01:09:39,551",I talked to your mom.
854,"01:09:39,634","01:09:41,636",Do you know what she said?
855,"01:09:45,932","01:09:49,144","She said
your idea of love was sick,"
856,"01:09:49,227","01:09:52,981","that you were disturbed
and that I should stay away."
857,"01:09:54,190","01:09:55,400",She's right.
858,"01:09:59,112","01:10:01,323",Good luck with your prize.
859,"01:10:07,203","01:10:08,681","- Dad, guess what.
- What?"
860,"01:10:08,705","01:10:09,915",I made the top five.
861,"01:10:09,998","01:10:11,958",Of course you did.
862,"01:10:12,042","01:10:14,711","Aw, that's wonderful, Katie."
863,"01:10:14,794","01:10:19,382","Felipe,
today you will pair with..."
864,"01:10:19,466","01:10:21,569","I mean, honestly,
the way that things are going,"
865,"01:10:21,593","01:10:23,345","I think they're gonna
make Felipe my partner"
866,"01:10:23,428","01:10:25,263",for the prize dance.
867,"01:10:33,438","01:10:34,439",Bonjour.
868,"01:10:36,816","01:10:38,068",I need new shoes.
869,"01:10:38,151","01:10:40,570",I'm done helping you.
870,"01:10:40,654","01:10:42,530",There are only five of us left.
871,"01:10:42,614","01:10:44,115",You're on your own now.
872,"01:10:46,159","01:10:48,495",My shoes.
873,"01:10:48,578","01:10:49,829",Shoes.
874,"01:10:49,913","01:10:52,415",Your shoes. I know.
875,"01:10:52,499","01:10:53,833",There's only one prize.
876,"01:10:53,917","01:10:55,293",I was nice.
877,"01:10:59,839","01:11:00,924",Félicitation.
878,"01:11:01,007","01:11:03,468","You have made it
to the top five."
879,"01:11:03,551","01:11:06,262","The partner you are
paired with today has been"
880,"01:11:06,346","01:11:08,473","carefully assigned
by Madame Brunelle"
881,"01:11:08,556","01:11:11,434","to be your final partner
for the prize dance."
882,"01:11:11,518","01:11:16,564","Together you will choose an
excerpt from Romeo and Juliet."
883,"01:11:23,530","01:11:25,240",What's wrong?
884,"01:11:25,323","01:11:26,992",This is such bullshit.
885,"01:11:27,075","01:11:29,077",It's like they want me to lose.
886,"01:11:30,412","01:11:32,163",We're gonna figure it out.
887,"01:11:33,623","01:11:36,668","We're not gonna let anything
or anyone come between us."
888,"01:11:38,044","01:11:40,171","We're not gonna give up
on the pact."
889,"01:11:40,255","01:11:41,339",I know.
890,"01:11:41,423","01:11:44,426","It's just...
you wouldn't understand."
891,"01:11:46,011","01:11:47,929",This is my one chance.
892,"01:12:05,989","01:12:07,282",Okay.
893,"01:12:21,796","01:12:23,757","The prize dance
is on the horizon,"
894,"01:12:23,840","01:12:27,177","and nothing should
distract you from that."
895,"01:12:27,260","01:12:29,262","However, it's come
to my attention"
896,"01:12:29,345","01:12:33,767","that there is a good opportunity
for the right ballerina."
897,"01:12:36,352","01:12:39,981","We are looking for an understudy
for Sarah."
898,"01:12:40,065","01:12:42,275","It is a more
contemporary project."
899,"01:12:42,358","01:12:43,610",It would be...
900,"01:12:43,693","01:12:45,570",an honor to work...
901,"01:12:45,653","01:12:47,113",with you two.
902,"01:12:48,156","01:12:49,407",Good luck.
903,"01:12:50,450","01:12:52,535",Don't be nervous.
904,"01:12:52,619","01:12:55,163",Just show us what you can do.
905,"01:13:26,528","01:13:28,196","Virginia,"
906,"01:13:28,279","01:13:31,366","let's not waste any more
of Sarah and Benjamin's time."
907,"01:13:31,449","01:13:33,201",Shall we?
908,"01:14:09,362","01:14:11,322",I'm happy they picked you.
909,"01:14:12,365","01:14:14,200",You don't seem happy.
910,"01:14:14,284","01:14:15,702",I am.
911,"01:14:17,495","01:14:19,581",You deserve it.
912,"01:14:20,206","01:14:21,708",Thanks.
913,"01:14:21,791","01:14:25,170","I mean, it's not the prize, but
it's still pretty cool, I guess."
914,"01:14:25,253","01:14:26,629",Where is your earring?
915,"01:14:27,922","01:14:29,924","Oh, um..."
916,"01:14:30,008","01:14:31,342",I don't know.
917,"01:14:31,426","01:14:33,553",It must've fallen out.
918,"01:14:34,554","01:14:35,680",I'll give you another one.
919,"01:14:35,763","01:14:37,265","Oh, no, no, no,
don't worry about it."
920,"01:14:37,348","01:14:39,267","Don't worry,
it's just a shiny rock."
921,"01:14:40,935","01:14:42,562",I don't want another one.
922,"01:14:51,196","01:14:53,406",We need to talk.
923,"01:14:53,489","01:14:55,533","- About the pact.
- Are you serious?"
924,"01:14:55,617","01:14:58,161",You don't want to keep the pact
925,"01:14:58,244","01:14:59,597","now that you're ranked
higher than me,"
926,"01:14:59,621","01:15:01,223","but you were fine with it
when you were at the bottom."
927,"01:15:01,247","01:15:02,457",It's not about that.
928,"01:15:04,542","01:15:06,711",I'm just trying to be realistic.
929,"01:15:06,794","01:15:08,338",Since when?
930,"01:15:08,421","01:15:10,173","You think you can
fuck your way to stardom"
931,"01:15:10,256","01:15:12,550","and that's gonna make you
high-class."
932,"01:15:49,879","01:15:52,048","Kate Sanders, you're up."
933,"01:16:48,813","01:16:50,648",We need to rehearse.
934,"01:18:22,198","01:18:23,408",What did you expect?
935,"01:18:25,952","01:18:27,203",It doesn't matter.
936,"01:18:27,286","01:18:30,706","Benjamin's gonna be a judge
at the final evaluation."
937,"01:18:30,790","01:18:32,667",He knows what I can do.
938,"01:18:32,750","01:18:34,085",It does matter.
939,"01:18:34,168","01:18:36,879",This is so unfair to me.
940,"01:18:36,963","01:18:38,548",Did you think of this?
941,"01:18:40,967","01:18:43,094",Luc's refusing to dance with me.
942,"01:18:43,177","01:18:45,555","I can't be expected to rehearse
for Benjamin's project"
943,"01:18:45,638","01:18:47,390","and the academy
at the same time."
944,"01:18:47,473","01:18:50,518","Well, that's exactly
what you are expected to do."
945,"01:18:50,601","01:18:51,978",The understudy role doesn't mean
946,"01:18:52,061","01:18:54,397","that you're gonna get
a contract..."
947,"01:18:54,480","01:18:55,648",or win the prize.
948,"01:18:55,731","01:18:56,941",It doesn't mean anything.
949,"01:18:57,024","01:18:59,235",You've never liked me.
950,"01:18:59,318","01:19:01,821","You have never given me
a real chance."
951,"01:19:01,904","01:19:03,614",Do you think I don't see you?
952,"01:19:04,866","01:19:07,160","If I didn't like you,
I'd just let you fail."
953,"01:19:31,017","01:19:32,935","Oh, thank you."
954,"01:19:33,019","01:19:34,455",You look great.
955,"01:19:36,481","01:19:38,483",We are gathered here today
956,"01:19:38,566","01:19:43,571","to celebrate the birth
of this obscenely talented brat"
957,"01:19:43,654","01:19:46,949","that I'm very proud to call
my collaborator and friend."
958,"01:19:47,033","01:19:49,368","Let's be honest, Benjamin."
959,"01:19:49,452","01:19:53,080","This toast wouldn't be possible
if not for all those rich people"
960,"01:19:53,164","01:19:55,875","you convince
to empty their pockets"
961,"01:19:55,958","01:19:58,044",for the sake of our art form.
962,"01:19:58,127","01:20:01,839","So, may you continue
to pander to their demands."
963,"01:20:01,923","01:20:03,883",Long live Benjamin.
964,"01:20:03,966","01:20:06,177","- Long live ballet.
- Long live ballet."
965,"01:20:06,260","01:20:07,470",Long live ballet.
966,"01:20:07,553","01:20:09,972",Long live ballet!
967,"01:20:14,977","01:20:17,939","What did she mean by
""pander to their demands""?"
968,"01:20:18,022","01:20:19,106",Hmm.
969,"01:20:19,190","01:20:21,484","She's just poking fun at me,"
970,"01:20:21,567","01:20:23,903","because it was a donor who
insisted that she would be cast"
971,"01:20:23,986","01:20:26,364",at the beginning of her career.
972,"01:20:26,447","01:20:27,573",What do you mean?
973,"01:20:27,657","01:20:29,784","Well, they gave
a bunch of money to ballet"
974,"01:20:29,867","01:20:32,912","so they could strongly suggest
their favorite to be cast."
975,"01:20:33,996","01:20:35,873",And you agreed to this?
976,"01:20:35,957","01:20:37,375",She was terrific.
977,"01:20:39,377","01:20:41,671",But not the best?
978,"01:20:41,754","01:20:45,007","She became the best
with my guidance."
979,"01:20:46,968","01:20:49,720","- But...
- But what, ma chérie?"
980,"01:20:49,804","01:20:51,639","It's never been
an even playing field."
981,"01:20:51,722","01:20:55,851","It's always been about
sex, blood, money."
982,"01:20:55,935","01:20:57,562",It's all that matters.
983,"01:22:24,690","01:22:26,317",Katie?
984,"01:22:26,400","01:22:27,443",Are you okay?
985,"01:22:27,526","01:22:29,070",I need you to tell me the truth.
986,"01:22:30,780","01:22:32,782",Why did you sell the house?
987,"01:22:34,241","01:22:36,118",They said...
988,"01:22:36,202","01:22:40,164","the Durand family had a change
of heart, whatever that means."
989,"01:22:42,375","01:22:44,794","The bastards
revoked your scholarship."
990,"01:23:17,118","01:23:18,744",What's wrong?
991,"01:23:28,462","01:23:30,214",You're scaring me.
992,"01:23:32,299","01:23:34,301",I know what you did.
993,"01:23:42,768","01:23:44,478",You used me.
994,"01:23:47,273","01:23:49,942","Made me think
we were actually friends."
995,"01:23:52,570","01:23:55,114","And then you had
your parents intervene"
996,"01:23:55,197","01:23:58,242",to cancel my scholarship.
997,"01:23:58,325","01:24:00,327",Why would you do that to me?
998,"01:24:01,579","01:24:04,248","I-I s... I swear, I didn't..."
999,"01:24:04,331","01:24:05,791",I didn't.
1000,"01:24:06,834","01:24:07,960",I didn't know.
1001,"01:24:08,043","01:24:10,171",You're such a liar!
1002,"01:24:15,551","01:24:19,346","I swear on my life, I would
never purposely hurt you."
1003,"01:24:20,389","01:24:21,640",We're best friends.
1004,"01:24:21,724","01:24:22,933",We're sisters.
1005,"01:24:23,017","01:24:25,352","You would have a threesome
with your sister?"
1006,"01:24:28,022","01:24:31,609","Oh, that's right.
You probably would."
1007,"01:24:49,919","01:24:51,128",Kate!
1008,"01:24:52,296","01:24:53,756",Can we talk?
1009,"01:24:55,841","01:24:57,384",Please.
1010,"01:25:28,541","01:25:30,334",What's going on?
1011,"01:25:30,417","01:25:31,460",Is it true?
1012,"01:25:32,503","01:25:33,838",Is what true?
1013,"01:25:35,214","01:25:36,757",You and Ollie.
1014,"01:25:38,217","01:25:39,510",Everyone is saying that
1015,"01:25:39,593","01:25:41,095","your mother
caught you guys fucking,"
1016,"01:25:41,178","01:25:43,222","and that's why
he killed himself."
1017,"01:25:47,059","01:25:49,562","No, it's not... it's not true."
1018,"01:25:51,522","01:25:53,148",That's not true.
1019,"01:25:57,194","01:26:00,030","- You know that's not true.
- Don't fucking touch me."
1020,"01:26:01,615","01:26:03,242",You disgust me.
1021,"01:26:40,613","01:26:42,156",Hi.
1022,"01:27:55,854","01:27:58,232","I was just
a few years older than you."
1023,"01:28:00,234","01:28:02,903",I was dancing Swan Lake.
1024,"01:28:02,987","01:28:04,405",Main stage.
1025,"01:28:05,864","01:28:08,742","One day, I noticed
that I was gaining weight."
1026,"01:28:08,826","01:28:10,828",It didn't make any sense.
1027,"01:28:14,248","01:28:16,333","- What'd you do?
- Nothing."
1028,"01:28:17,710","01:28:19,670",I kept dancing.
1029,"01:28:19,753","01:28:22,548",Harder than I had before.
1030,"01:28:22,631","01:28:26,260","Whatever life was inside me
bled out a few weeks later."
1031,"01:28:26,343","01:28:29,763",You cannot change the past.
1032,"01:28:34,852","01:28:36,395",You cannot.
1033,"01:28:42,359","01:28:46,447","All you can do is
learn to accept your grief,"
1034,"01:28:46,530","01:28:48,991","your shame,"
1035,"01:28:49,074","01:28:50,909",your regret.
1036,"01:28:52,870","01:28:55,914","It's a heavy rock
we carry around."
1037,"01:28:55,998","01:28:58,250","And one that we can
never put down."
1038,"01:29:00,002","01:29:01,211",But...
1039,"01:29:03,005","01:29:05,007",...I have learned...
1040,"01:29:06,884","01:29:08,886",...to love my rock.
1041,"01:29:11,305","01:29:13,807",Instead of...
1042,"01:29:13,891","01:29:15,893",of weighing me down...
1043,"01:29:17,811","01:29:19,813",...it's made me stronger.
1044,"01:29:33,494","01:29:35,537",Blessed is she who falls.
1045,"01:29:39,666","01:29:43,212",Blessed is she who rises again.
1046,"01:30:25,420","01:30:27,297",So you're dancing a solo.
1047,"01:30:28,340","01:30:30,425",Yes.
1048,"01:30:30,509","01:30:33,095","Madame Brunelle says, because
you decided to dance alone,"
1049,"01:30:33,178","01:30:35,139",she's reassigning Felipe to me.
1050,"01:30:37,057","01:30:39,059",Isn't that what you wanted?
1051,"01:31:07,588","01:31:09,965","Welcome, friends,"
1052,"01:31:10,048","01:31:11,633",family.
1053,"01:31:11,717","01:31:14,052","Thank you for being here

choreograph like that."
1076,"01:37:35,225","01:37:38,061","I would love to dance for you
one day."
1077,"01:37:38,144","01:37:40,188",It would be an honor.
1078,"01:37:59,958","01:38:02,377","Thank you for your patience,
everybody."
1079,"01:38:05,046","01:38:06,923",You have made me...
1080,"01:38:07,007","01:38:09,801","very proud, petits rats."
1081,"01:38:09,884","01:38:14,389","If I call your name, I will have
to ask you to leave the stage..."
1082,"01:38:15,682","01:38:18,852","...and to pursue opportunities
elsewhere."
1083,"01:38:20,645","01:38:22,022",Natasha.
1084,"01:38:26,818","01:38:28,236",Peter.
1085,"01:38:32,490","01:38:33,908",Isabelle.

1090,"01:38:54,721","01:38:59,934","we award the prize
for best male dancer to you."
1091,"01:39:06,691","01:39:08,610",Congratulations.
1092,"01:39:08,693","01:39:10,195",Thank you.
1093,"01:39:11,655","01:39:14,199","And now
to our talented ballerinas,"
1094,"01:39:14,282","01:39:17,744",a subject of much debate.
1095,"01:39:17,827","01:39:19,829",Gia.
1096,"01:39:21,206","01:39:22,832",You haven't won the prize today.
1097,"01:39:22,916","01:39:24,668",But we would like to offer you
1098,"01:39:24,751","01:39:27,504","an apprenticeship
with the Paris Opera Ballet."
1099,"01:39:32,217","01:39:33,677",Merci.
1100,"01:39:34,719","01:39:36,346",Bravo.
1101,"01:39:49,442","01:39:52,529","The time has come
for which ballerina"
1102,"01:39:52,612","01:39:55,240",will win the prize.
1103,"01:39:55,323","01:40:01,162","The winner of the contract
for the Paris Opera Ballet is..."
1104,"01:40:07,377","01:40:09,045",Wait.
1105,"01:40:11,673","01:40:13,007",I don't want it.
1106,"01:40:21,933","01:40:23,351",What are you doing?
1107,"01:40:24,394","01:40:26,229",What about Ollie's prize?
1108,"01:40:27,397","01:40:30,316","If you leave now,
you are on your own."
1109,"01:40:30,400","01:40:32,760","You have no idea how to fend
for yourself in the real world."
1110,"01:40:32,819","01:40:34,487",You will be cut off.
1111,"01:40:34,571","01:40:36,114",Do you understand?
1112,"01:40:36,197","01:40:37,407",I do.
1113,"01:40:38,616","01:40:40,076",Marine!
1114,"01:40:41,411","01:40:44,414","Mademoiselle Sanders,"
1115,"01:40:44,497","01:40:48,877",the prize belongs to you.
1116,"01:41:02,724","01:41:04,893","Congratulations, Virginia."
1117,"01:41:10,190","01:41:12,192","I know you would have
picked her."
1118,"01:41:13,818","01:41:15,820",I saw you with her father.
1119,"01:41:17,197","01:41:19,574",I know he paid you to pick her.
1120,"01:41:19,657","01:41:21,367","The family revoked
your scholarship."
1121,"01:41:21,451","01:41:24,037",I was trying to reverse that.
1122,"01:41:24,120","01:41:26,790",I picked the best dancer.
1123,"01:41:28,792","01:41:30,418",So who was it?
1124,"01:41:31,669","01:41:33,922",Me or M?
1125,"01:41:37,675","01:41:38,885",Please.
1126,"01:41:40,386","01:41:42,138",I need to know.
1127,"01:42:27,267","01:42:28,476",Kate!
1128,"01:42:31,187","01:42:32,939",Hi.
1129,"01:42:33,940","01:42:36,401",I saw the show.
1130,"01:42:37,443","01:42:38,570",You were really good.
1131,"01:42:39,612","01:42:40,864",Thanks.
1132,"01:42:44,993","01:42:46,911",How are you?
1133,"01:42:46,995","01:42:48,413",Actually really good.
1134,"01:42:49,831","01:42:51,666","Great, even."
1135,"01:42:54,043","01:42:57,046","It took me a long time to be
able to say that, but, um..."
1136,"01:42:58,298","01:43:00,174",...it's true.
1137,"01:43:00,258","01:43:01,718",You still dancing?
1138,"01:43:03,344","01:43:05,346",Mostly at the Jungle.
1139,"01:43:05,430","01:43:08,349",That place still exists?
1140,"01:43:08,433","01:43:10,768","You should come by sometime
if you ever feel like it."
1141,"01:43:10,852","01:43:13,605","I just finished
choreographing this new piece."
1142,"01:43:19,235","01:43:21,237",I came by to say thank you.
1143,"01:43:23,573","01:43:25,491",For what?
1144,"01:43:25,575","01:43:28,161","You really forced me
to face myself."
1145,"01:43:29,537","01:43:31,581",And I feel free now.
1146,"01:43:35,001","01:43:37,462","I hope you find that, too."
1147,"01:44:03,738","01:44:04,989",Hey!
1148,"01:44:05,073","01:44:06,324",Hi.
1149,"01:44:07,492","01:44:09,786","- What the fuck was that?
- What do you mean?"
1150,"01:44:09,869","01:44:12,747","What kind of fucked-up game
are you trying to play?"
1151,"01:44:12,830","01:44:15,249","- I'm not...
- Bullshit!"
1152,"01:44:16,250","01:44:18,169",You should be mad at me!
1153,"01:44:18,252","01:44:19,671",You should fucking hate me!
1154,"01:44:19,754","01:44:21,756",Why don't you hate me?
1155,"01:44:30,765","01:44:32,392",I'm sorry.
1156,"01:44:36,980","01:44:38,147",Sorry.
1157,"01:44:45,905","01:44:48,449",You have no idea
1158,"01:44:48,533","01:44:51,452","how much I wish
I could take back"
1159,"01:44:51,536","01:44:54,956","everything that happened,
everything I did."
1160,"01:44:57,625","01:44:59,043",I'm sorry.
1161,"01:45:05,008","01:45:06,634",Virginia.
1162,"01:45:11,848","01:45:14,058",Blessed is she who falls.
1163,"01:45:15,226","01:45:17,729",Blessed is she who rises again.
1164,"01:45:30,074","01:45:32,285",The animals were behaving badly.
1165,"01:45:39,834","01:45:43,671","So the gods put a blanket over
the Earth to block out the sun."
1166,"01:45:47,842","01:45:49,886","Until one little bird
flew higher"
1167,"01:45:49,969","01:45:52,388","than any bird
had ever flown before,"
1168,"01:45:52,472","01:45:55,683","so high she poked a hole
in the blanket."
1169,"01:47:23,437","01:47:25,648",The fall nearly broke her.
1170,"01:47:27,024","01:47:30,653","But she embraced the pain
she could no longer escape..."
1171,"01:47:32,029","01:47:36,784","...and opened her heart
once more to the sky."
