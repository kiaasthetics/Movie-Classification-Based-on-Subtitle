408,"00:29:33,870","00:29:36,420","And he was a vile, low down,"
409,"00:29:36,420","00:29:38,643","stenchy, white trash mother fucker."
410,"00:29:41,610","00:29:43,680","And sometimes I think that, you know,"
411,"00:29:43,680","00:29:47,433","my sole purpose on this

412,"00:29:48,387","00:29:50,237","He wouldn't stop beating on my mommy,"
413,"00:29:52,380","00:29:56,193","so I shot him with his own gun, pop."
414,"00:29:58,260","00:30:01,263","It was a shitty gun, so
he kept coming, you know?"

418,"00:30:10,710","00:30:12,060",He never got back up again.
419,"00:30:13,309","00:30:15,060","And I was like, ""Thank God."

421,"00:30:18,720","00:30:19,833",And he was ugly too.
