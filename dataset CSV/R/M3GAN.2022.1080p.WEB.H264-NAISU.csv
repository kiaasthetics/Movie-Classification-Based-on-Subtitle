1,"00:01:11,930","00:01:14,900","Hey, sweetie. I got something
that's gonna make you feel better."
2,"00:01:22,320","00:01:24,190","Purrpetual petz
are just like real pets,"
3,"00:01:24,390","00:01:26,636","except that when you talk to
them, they actually talk back!"
4,"00:01:26,660","00:01:28,120",Amazeballs!
5,"00:01:28,320","00:01:30,330","There's over
six different petz to collect,"
6,"00:01:30,530","00:01:34,020","each equipped with their own personalities
and entirely spontaneous reactions!"
7,"00:01:34,220","00:01:35,470",Careful. That's my butt.
8,"00:01:35,670","00:01:37,440","They speak
eight different languages."
9,"00:01:39,120","00:01:40,440",They can take pictures.
10,"00:01:40,510","00:01:42,480","Come on, sweetheart.
Find the lens."
11,"00:01:42,680","00:01:45,790","And with the customized
app, you can even feed your friend."
12,"00:01:45,990","00:01:46,990",But not too much!
13,"00:01:47,100","00:01:49,420",Uh-oh. Cleanup on aisle seven.
14,"00:01:49,620","00:01:51,260","The app is updated
with new content daily,"
15,"00:01:51,410","00:01:52,970","so you can do
almost anything together."
16,"00:01:53,170","00:01:55,360","You can watch YouTube videos,
learn fun facts,"
17,"00:01:55,560","00:01:57,810","play multiplatform games,
buy accessories for your pet."
18,"00:01:58,010","00:02:01,010","With so many options, what
will you and your pet do next?"
19,"00:02:04,150","00:02:07,330","Mmm, jelly berries
makes me feel good."
20,"00:02:09,290","00:02:10,956","Cady, look. We're almost
at the top of the mountain."
21,"00:02:10,980","00:02:12,920",Can you see the hotel?
22,"00:02:13,120","00:02:16,130","Ooh, well, that's interesting. Do
you know what else is interesting?"
23,"00:02:17,270","00:02:18,970",Oopsie-Daisy!
24,"00:02:19,160","00:02:21,486","I thought we were gonna limit
screen time to 30 minutes a day."
25,"00:02:21,510","00:02:23,426","What are you telling me for?
I didn't give it to her."
26,"00:02:23,450","00:02:25,836","I'm just saying, I think... cady,
can you turn it down, please?"
27,"00:02:25,860","00:02:27,900","I need to go to the bathroom.
Are we there yet?"
28,"00:02:28,100","00:02:29,780","If we make rules,
we need to stick to them."
29,"00:02:29,930","00:02:31,970","If she wasn't on that,
she'd be climbing all over."
30,"00:02:32,070","00:02:34,840","So you would rather she
sat there feeding a toy virtual food"
31,"00:02:35,040","00:02:36,090",until it shits itself?
32,"00:02:36,290","00:02:37,810","Cady, turn it down."
33,"00:02:38,010","00:02:39,330",I already did turn it down.
34,"00:02:39,530","00:02:41,570",What was Gemma thinking?
35,"00:02:41,770","00:02:43,616","""It's my niece's birthday.
I'm gonna get her a present."""
36,"00:02:43,640","00:02:45,546","She works for
the company that makes them."
37,"00:02:45,570","00:02:47,650","She probably didn't even have to
pay for shipping."
38,"00:02:47,850","00:02:51,690","Honestly, what is the purpose of a toy
if you have to play with it on an iPad?"
39,"00:02:51,890","00:02:53,490","This is what
the future looks like, okay?"
40,"00:02:53,680","00:02:55,410",You just have to get used to it.
41,"00:02:56,270","00:02:57,620","Oh, my god!"
42,"00:02:57,820","00:02:59,700",And away we go!
43,"00:02:59,900","00:03:02,140","- We're all right.
- We should've put chains on the car."
44,"00:03:02,280","00:03:05,041","Neither of us knew that was a thing
until, like, ten minutes ago, okay?"
45,"00:03:05,110","00:03:06,560",Don't act like it's my fault.
46,"00:03:06,760","00:03:08,640","Oh, my god! Ryan! Seriously!"
47,"00:03:08,840","00:03:11,090","What do you want me
to do? Mom, I dropped Leroy."
48,"00:03:11,290","00:03:14,210","Why did you tell that guy at
the gate this was a four-wheel drive?"
49,"00:03:14,250","00:03:16,531","- Help me, cady.
- It looks like a four-wheel drive."
50,"00:03:16,600","00:03:18,090","Cady, what are you doing?"
51,"00:03:18,290","00:03:20,571","- Cady, cady. Jesus Christ!
- Cady, put your seat belt on!"
52,"00:03:22,680","00:03:25,340","- I can't see anything.
- So stop moving forward."
53,"00:03:27,820","00:03:29,690","We can't just sit
in the middle of the road."
54,"00:03:31,240","00:03:33,760","Look,
we'll wait for this to clear,"
55,"00:03:33,960","00:03:35,766","and then find some place
where we can pull over"
56,"00:03:35,790","00:03:38,910","and just wait for one of those
snow trucks to clear the road."
57,"00:03:39,110","00:03:40,560","Yeah,
how long is that gonna take?"
58,"00:04:03,000","00:04:05,720","Funki,
a toy company for the future."
59,"00:04:07,280","00:04:10,210","Remember,
the key to fun is funki."
60,"00:04:45,790","00:04:47,670","- Why are we doing this?
- Because we have to."
61,"00:04:47,870","00:04:49,910","If we could at least show him
what we have,"
62,"00:04:50,110","00:04:51,430",he would... no. Mm-mmm.
63,"00:04:51,630","00:04:53,390","You said so yourself.
Not until she's ready."
64,"00:04:55,360","00:04:56,360",Hey.
65,"00:04:59,810","00:05:01,190",Is that what I think it is?
66,"00:05:27,530","00:05:29,470",Transparency looks good.
67,"00:05:29,670","00:05:31,920","Yeah, well, for what
we paid for it, it better."
68,"00:05:32,120","00:05:34,160","Okay, here we go."
69,"00:05:34,360","00:05:35,400",Happy.
70,"00:05:37,230","00:05:38,230",Okay.
71,"00:05:38,330","00:05:39,580",Sad.
72,"00:05:41,820","00:05:43,030",Confused.
73,"00:05:43,230","00:05:44,390","Wait, wait. Stop."
74,"00:05:44,540","00:05:45,830",Why is her face doing that?
75,"00:05:46,030","00:05:47,350",What is happening?
76,"00:05:47,550","00:05:49,240","I... I Don't know, Gemma.
It's your code."
77,"00:05:49,440","00:05:51,040","Yeah, thanks.
I know it's my code, Cole,"
78,"00:05:51,240","00:05:53,870","but she doesn't look confused.
She looks demented."
79,"00:05:54,070","00:05:56,010","You want me to
take the skin back off?"
80,"00:05:56,210","00:05:59,530","- Well, she's not responding. So...
- Okay, here we go."
81,"00:06:01,870","00:06:03,980","Oh, shit. It's
stuck. just be care..."
82,"00:06:04,180","00:06:05,740","Hey, Don't tear it."
83,"00:06:05,940","00:06:08,056",I know. I'm not gonna tear... ow.
84,"00:06:08,080","00:06:10,090","Oh, no, no, no. Shit."
85,"00:06:10,290","00:06:11,990","Okay, so what do we do?"
86,"00:06:12,190","00:06:14,230",I guess we gotta open the door.
87,"00:06:18,510","00:06:19,510",Gem.
88,"00:06:21,070","00:06:23,860","What in the name of
ever-loving Christ is this?"
89,"00:06:24,060","00:06:26,110","David, if you just give me
a minute to explain..."
90,"00:06:26,310","00:06:29,110","Is this why you moved your lab,
Gemma? So you can keep secrets from me?"
91,"00:06:29,310","00:06:31,150","No, no, no.
We talked about this, David."
92,"00:06:31,350","00:06:34,770","We talked about you putting it on
ice until you had a new petz model."
93,"00:06:34,970","00:06:36,810",How much did you spend on this?
94,"00:06:37,630","00:06:39,400",Are you even aware
95,"00:06:39,600","00:06:41,986","of the shit Tsunami that just
swept in over this furzeez spot?"
96,"00:06:42,010","00:06:43,290","I'm sorry, what?"
97,"00:06:59,030","00:07:00,936","Are we supposed to be
worried about that? It's a rip-off."
98,"00:07:00,960","00:07:02,970","You're right, Gemma.
It is a rip-off."
99,"00:07:03,170","00:07:04,840","They do the exact same thing
we do."
100,"00:07:05,040","00:07:08,740","And you know what else?
They do it for half the price."
101,"00:07:08,940","00:07:11,080","I told you
we needed to go simpler."
102,"00:07:11,280","00:07:12,570",Didn't I tell her?
103,"00:07:12,770","00:07:14,740","Six months ago, I begged you..."
104,"00:07:14,940","00:07:19,300","I begged you to please give me an
option I can put on a shelf for 50 bucks."
105,"00:07:19,500","00:07:21,580","- And we are working on it. I promise.
- Yeah."
106,"00:07:21,780","00:07:24,130","But, David, the only way
to stay ahead of the competition"
107,"00:07:24,330","00:07:27,130","is to come up with toys that
are too advanced to replicate."
108,"00:07:27,330","00:07:29,770","I know the tech on petz seems
more complex than it needs to be,"
109,"00:07:29,890","00:07:33,110","but that's only because I was using it
as a launchpad for something bigger."
110,"00:07:33,310","00:07:35,520","In each pet,
we installed a listening model"
111,"00:07:35,720","00:07:38,320","that targets conversational
patterns among kids."
112,"00:07:38,520","00:07:39,770",You did not just tell me that.
113,"00:07:39,970","00:07:41,800","I know she doesn't
look like much now,"
114,"00:07:42,000","00:07:44,640","but I promise, if you just let us
show you what m3gan is capable of,"
115,"00:07:44,840","00:07:47,740","you will realize that this is what
we've been working towards."
116,"00:07:47,940","00:07:48,940",M3gan?
117,"00:07:49,640","00:07:51,290","""Model 3 generative Android."""
118,"00:07:51,950","00:07:53,330","""M3gan"" for short."
119,"00:07:54,780","00:07:56,610","Tess,
load up the intro simulation."
120,"00:07:56,810","00:07:57,890","- Now?
- Yeah."
121,"00:07:59,470","00:08:01,450","M3gan, say hi to David."
122,"00:08:01,650","00:08:03,380",As in the boss David?
123,"00:08:03,580","00:08:05,480","Well, I guess
I should call you dad."
124,"00:08:07,790","00:08:09,790","Allow me to tell you a
little bit about my wormhole."
125,"00:08:09,860","00:08:13,110","I was born in a sandwich hat,
and I wolf many cabbages."
126,"00:08:13,310","00:08:14,600",Uh...
127,"00:08:14,800","00:08:16,700","This isn't supposed to happen,
obviously."
128,"00:08:16,900","00:08:18,150",Just give me one moment.
129,"00:08:18,350","00:08:19,700",Sorry about the noise.
130,"00:08:19,900","00:08:21,980","- Gem?
- One second, Cole."
131,"00:08:22,180","00:08:24,646","It's probably just a race condition.
It'll take me a minute to fix."
132,"00:08:24,670","00:08:26,400","Gem, it's not a race condition."
133,"00:08:26,600","00:08:28,881","I might have forgotten to put
in the polypropylene barrier."
134,"00:08:29,020","00:08:30,306","Oh, no."
135,"00:08:30,330","00:08:31,680","- God.
- Tess, turn it off!"
136,"00:08:31,880","00:08:33,750",I can't.
137,"00:08:45,730","00:08:49,730","I want the petz prototype
on my desk by Friday."
138,"00:08:49,930","00:08:53,840","And I want you to take
this cyborg puppet show"
139,"00:08:54,040","00:08:56,910","and put it in a dark closet
where it belongs."
140,"00:09:02,400","00:09:04,920","And I want a swipe card
for this door!"
141,"00:09:09,440","00:09:13,440","For what it's worth, I
thought she looked really cool."
142,"00:09:39,610","00:09:42,890","Sweetie, it's gonna be
okay. We're gonna take care of you."
143,"00:09:43,090","00:09:46,450","Just need to check your
blood pressure. It'll be all right."
144,"00:09:46,650","00:09:48,580","Radiology, pick up line four."
145,"00:09:50,860","00:09:53,760","So, this is to Grant
you temporary protective custody."
146,"00:09:53,960","00:09:56,350","Just sign your name
and date it at the bottom."
147,"00:09:58,450","00:10:00,180",Thank you.
148,"00:10:00,380","00:10:02,840","Now, I Don't know if your sister
had a family lawyer already,"
149,"00:10:03,040","00:10:06,430","but if not, it would be something
to consider moving forward."
150,"00:11:01,000","00:11:02,830",Hey! Hey! Hey! Celia!
151,"00:11:04,140","00:11:06,490","Could you please keep your dog
on your side of the fence?"
152,"00:11:06,690","00:11:08,530","I just spent 80 bucks
on a shock collar."
153,"00:11:08,730","00:11:10,810","Maybe try
cranking it up a notch."
154,"00:11:11,010","00:11:12,290","Oh, who's this little lady?"
155,"00:11:12,490","00:11:14,330","That is my niece, cady."
156,"00:11:14,530","00:11:16,120",Is she staying for the weekend?
157,"00:11:16,320","00:11:18,810","You know what? It's been
a really long drive, and, um,"
158,"00:11:19,010","00:11:21,020","I would just
really appreciate it"
159,"00:11:21,220","00:11:23,750","if you did not have your dog
running onto my yard all the time."
160,"00:11:23,950","00:11:27,930","And also, Don't spray your
chemicals onto my driveway, please."
161,"00:11:28,130","00:11:31,000","Ah, shit. I'm sorry. You wanna
borrow this once I'm done?"
162,"00:11:31,200","00:11:33,486","No, I Don't wanna borrow it.
I Don't wanna spend my afternoon"
163,"00:11:33,510","00:11:35,110","getting your sediment
off of my driveway."
164,"00:11:35,200","00:11:36,450",Just hang a tarp or something.
165,"00:11:36,650","00:11:37,650",Okay.
166,"00:11:42,660","00:11:43,940","Welcome home, Gemma."
167,"00:11:44,140","00:11:46,080","You have six
unanswered voice messages"
168,"00:11:46,280","00:11:47,740",and five tinder notifications.
169,"00:11:47,940","00:11:49,770","Elsie, turn off."
170,"00:11:51,330","00:11:52,360",Sorry about that.
171,"00:11:53,950","00:11:57,130","Okay.
I'm gonna put these bags away."
172,"00:11:58,200","00:12:01,410","And, um, just make yourself
at home. Okay?"
173,"00:12:16,250","00:12:18,560","Oh, those aren't toys, cady."
174,"00:12:18,760","00:12:21,190","I mean... yeah, technically,
yeah, they're toys."
175,"00:12:21,390","00:12:23,360","They're just, um, collectibles."
176,"00:12:23,560","00:12:25,500","So you Don't actually
play with them."
177,"00:12:25,700","00:12:27,400","That probably sounds
really weird."
178,"00:12:27,600","00:12:28,740",Um...
179,"00:12:31,330","00:12:33,790","I'm trying to think
if I have anything..."
180,"00:12:33,990","00:12:37,440","Oh, what happened to the purrpetual
pet I got you for your birthday?"
181,"00:12:39,100","00:12:40,100",It's okay.
182,"00:12:40,720","00:12:42,140",I was just looking.
183,"00:12:47,450","00:12:50,490","I know it doesn't look like
much right now, but, um,"
184,"00:12:51,590","00:12:54,320","we will make it feel
cozy somehow. I promise."
185,"00:12:58,840","00:12:59,840",There.
186,"00:13:08,230","00:13:09,270",Look...
187,"00:13:13,340","00:13:17,240","I know this must be a lot
for you to take in right now."
188,"00:13:17,440","00:13:19,560","I just want you to know
I'm gonna do everything I can"
189,"00:13:19,760","00:13:21,760","to make this place
feel like home."
190,"00:13:22,730","00:13:25,660","And, um, if you need anything,"
191,"00:13:26,900","00:13:28,490",I'm just gonna be down the hall.
192,"00:13:29,840","00:13:31,530",Okay? Really close.
193,"00:13:34,080","00:13:35,810","You're not gonna
read me a story?"
194,"00:13:36,010","00:13:37,120",What's that?
195,"00:13:38,120","00:13:40,190","Mom always
read me a story before bed."
196,"00:13:41,020","00:13:43,340","Oh, um..."
197,"00:13:43,540","00:13:47,480","I Don't... I Don't think I really have
any kids' books here right now, cady."
198,"00:13:47,680","00:13:50,690","Um, but that's okay.
I can download one on my phone."
199,"00:13:51,720","00:13:52,830",That's fine.
200,"00:13:53,860","00:13:55,210",It's just...
201,"00:13:55,410","00:13:56,420",Oh.
202,"00:13:58,490","00:13:59,900",I just have to update the app.
203,"00:14:51,920","00:14:54,960","I can't believe this is happening.
I'm not equipped to handle this."
204,"00:14:55,160","00:14:56,890","I Don't even take care
of my own plants."
205,"00:14:57,090","00:14:59,000","Have you heard from
Ryan's parents?"
206,"00:14:59,200","00:15:01,766","Yeah, they called and offered to
help, but, like, they live in Florida."
207,"00:15:01,790","00:15:03,836","They're kind of weird.
I Don't know what their deal is."
208,"00:15:03,860","00:15:06,580","I'm just trying to figure out a
way to do this without getting fired."
209,"00:15:06,660","00:15:08,840","David's gonna shit blood
if I ask for more time off."
210,"00:15:09,040","00:15:12,150","Yeah, I know. But, Jesus,
gem, you just lost your sister."
211,"00:15:12,350","00:15:14,880","And we spent $100,000
of company funds"
212,"00:15:15,080","00:15:17,160","on a product
that he didn't even ask for."
213,"00:15:17,360","00:15:20,300","If we Don't get this petz prototype
to him soon, he's going to sue us."
214,"00:15:20,500","00:15:23,960","Okay, I Don't think you can be
worrying about work right now, gem."
215,"00:15:24,160","00:15:26,230","Right now, I think
you just need to focus on cady."
216,"00:15:26,430","00:15:27,750",What...
217,"00:15:27,950","00:15:28,950",Hold on.
218,"00:15:32,440","00:15:33,440",Hi.
219,"00:15:33,580","00:15:34,760",Hi.
220,"00:15:36,240","00:15:37,760",I'm Lydia.
221,"00:15:38,900","00:15:40,460",Oh! The therapist?
222,"00:15:40,660","00:15:42,380","Sorry, yeah. Please, come in."
223,"00:15:47,220","00:15:49,080",And you must be cady.
224,"00:15:49,280","00:15:51,360","Hi. Look at you,
still in your pajamas."
225,"00:15:51,560","00:15:53,080","Yeah, we were just watching TV."
226,"00:15:53,190","00:15:54,260",I see that.
227,"00:15:58,850","00:16:01,170","So, how does this work?"
228,"00:16:01,370","00:16:03,340","I just need to observe
the two of you together"
229,"00:16:03,540","00:16:05,200","for half an hour,
40 minutes or so."
230,"00:16:05,400","00:16:07,760","Oh. Okay. Doing what, exactly?"
231,"00:16:07,960","00:16:09,200","Oh, just hanging out."
232,"00:16:10,410","00:16:13,040","Maybe playing with some toys
or playing a game."
233,"00:16:13,240","00:16:15,280","Hey, cady, do you wanna grab
some toys to play with?"
234,"00:16:15,350","00:16:16,800",I Don't have any toys here.
235,"00:16:17,000","00:16:18,670","I just unpacked a bunch
this morning."
236,"00:16:18,870","00:16:21,010","They're just old. I Don't
think she plays with them."
237,"00:16:21,210","00:16:23,390","- What about these ones up here?
- Those aren't toys."
238,"00:16:23,590","00:16:26,550","They're aunt Gemma's collectibles.
You're not supposed to play with them."
239,"00:16:28,840","00:16:31,510","That's okay.
We can play with them."
240,"00:16:31,710","00:16:34,160","We can totally play with them.
Do you wanna play with them?"
241,"00:16:35,160","00:16:36,270",You wanna play... yeah.
242,"00:16:37,130","00:16:38,340",Play with it. No big deal.
243,"00:17:02,880","00:17:04,840","There's a lever you have to pull
on the bottom..."
244,"00:17:04,910","00:17:06,920","Maybe, Gemma,
for the sake of the exercise,"
245,"00:17:07,120","00:17:08,780",we might let cady lead.
246,"00:17:08,980","00:17:10,750","Yeah, I'm just
explaining how it works."
247,"00:17:10,950","00:17:13,440","Well, it's a toy. I'm sure
it's not that complicated."
248,"00:17:15,200","00:17:18,070","That's great, cady. Do you
want to roll it to aunt Gemma?"
249,"00:17:22,240","00:17:25,560","It's just that this is not what it was
designed to do. It does other things."
250,"00:17:28,590","00:17:30,360","But, yeah, totally."
251,"00:17:30,560","00:17:32,980","Let's just roll it on the ground
like a tennis ball."
252,"00:17:33,180","00:17:34,430",Let's do that instead.
253,"00:17:41,530","00:17:43,680","We'll do a few more sessions
with cady initially,"
254,"00:17:43,880","00:17:45,586","but that can happen
at your office or school."
255,"00:17:45,610","00:17:47,490","Yeah. I haven't had time
to look into that yet."
256,"00:17:47,540","00:17:50,790","Nicole was homeschooling her.
But, yeah, it's on my list."
257,"00:17:50,990","00:17:54,550","Sorry, can I just ask, how
close were you and your sister?"
258,"00:17:55,790","00:17:56,790",Oh...
259,"00:17:57,900","00:17:59,636","- I Don't know.
- But you wanted this, right?"
260,"00:17:59,660","00:18:00,660",To take custody?
261,"00:18:00,800","00:18:02,740","Yeah, of course."
262,"00:18:02,940","00:18:04,700","Okay, because
the father's parents have said"
263,"00:18:04,870","00:18:06,636","they're willing to take her
if it's too much."
264,"00:18:06,660","00:18:08,676","Wait. Did they contact you?
It's no big deal, Gemma."
265,"00:18:08,700","00:18:10,540","They're just trying to be
supportive."
266,"00:18:10,740","00:18:13,096","If Nicole wanted cady to go to
Jacksonville, she would have said so."
267,"00:18:13,120","00:18:15,780","But even so, I need to make my
own recommendations to the court"
268,"00:18:15,980","00:18:18,790","as to whether or not
this is a safe space."
269,"00:18:18,990","00:18:22,440","So, you're gonna need to make one or
two adjustments in order for this to work."
270,"00:18:24,370","00:18:25,440",Okay.
271,"00:18:47,910","00:18:49,580","Listen, cady, um,"
272,"00:18:49,780","00:18:53,610","I have this project at work
that's kind of overdue."
273,"00:18:53,810","00:18:56,340","And with all the time that
I had to take off last week,"
274,"00:18:56,540","00:18:58,340","I'm not really sure
I'm gonna get it done."
275,"00:19:01,890","00:19:05,000","Anyway, it's not gonna take
longer than a couple of hours."
276,"00:19:05,200","00:19:09,150","But if you could just hold down
the fort by yourself for a little while,"
277,"00:19:09,350","00:19:11,530",that would help me so much.
278,"00:19:11,730","00:19:14,150",You can use my iPad if you want.
279,"00:19:14,350","00:19:17,980","You can facetime a friend
or play a game or something."
280,"00:19:18,180","00:19:19,470",What about screen time?
281,"00:19:19,670","00:19:20,880",Hmm?
282,"00:19:21,880","00:19:23,850","How long
before I have to turn it off?"
283,"00:19:24,050","00:19:26,160","Oh, I Don't care.
As long as you want."
284,"00:19:27,540","00:19:30,000","I'm not gonna be gone that long.
I'll just be down the hall."
285,"00:19:30,190","00:19:32,930","And, uh, when I'm done,
we can go out somewhere."
286,"00:19:33,130","00:19:36,450","We can...
Go to a playground or..."
287,"00:19:37,170","00:19:38,620",Get something to eat.
288,"00:19:39,480","00:19:40,550",Okay?
289,"00:20:12,900","00:20:14,070",Cady?
290,"00:20:17,940","00:20:19,910","Cady, I'm sorry."
291,"00:20:20,110","00:20:21,110",Come here.
292,"00:20:26,940","00:20:29,190","I'm not off to
a very good start here, am I?"
293,"00:20:30,910","00:20:33,160","What is this?
Did you draw a picture?"
294,"00:20:33,360","00:20:34,680","Oh, my god."
295,"00:20:34,880","00:20:36,030",This is amazing.
296,"00:20:36,230","00:20:37,410",I'm still working on it.
297,"00:20:37,610","00:20:39,310",Tell me.
298,"00:20:39,510","00:20:42,030","It was actually supposed to be
a different animal for each head."
299,"00:20:42,230","00:20:43,410",Mm-hmm.
300,"00:20:43,610","00:20:45,146","Like, this one
was supposed to be a tiger."
301,"00:20:45,170","00:20:47,280","And this one was supposed
to be a grizzly bear,"
302,"00:20:47,480","00:20:49,380","but I can never seem to
get the fur right.Mmm."
303,"00:20:49,580","00:20:51,560",It's hard. I can relate.
304,"00:20:51,760","00:20:54,520","I've actually been working
with some furry creatures myself."
305,"00:20:55,530","00:20:56,870",Do you wanna see?
306,"00:20:57,420","00:20:58,560",Yeah?
307,"00:21:00,360","00:21:03,300","So we're working on a version of
the purrpetual pet that's cheaper,"
308,"00:21:03,500","00:21:05,160",but we still want it to be fun.
309,"00:21:05,360","00:21:07,990","So, what do you think?"
310,"00:21:10,890","00:21:11,920",Yeah.
311,"00:21:12,750","00:21:13,990",What's that?
312,"00:21:15,130","00:21:16,270",Oh!
313,"00:21:16,470","00:21:17,590",That's Bruce.
314,"00:21:17,790","00:21:19,730",Is he a toy?
315,"00:21:19,930","00:21:21,520","Yeah, kinda."
316,"00:21:21,720","00:21:24,170","He's a proxy robot. I built
him when I was in college."
317,"00:21:25,620","00:21:27,530",Why doesn't he have a face?
318,"00:21:27,730","00:21:31,630","Yeah, I know what you mean.
It's a pretty obvious design flaw."
319,"00:21:31,830","00:21:34,180","Okay, hold on.
Let's see what we have."
320,"00:21:39,150","00:21:41,160",Let's see this.
321,"00:21:41,360","00:21:42,360",How's that?
322,"00:21:43,780","00:21:45,300","Would you maybe
want to talk to him?"
323,"00:21:46,270","00:21:47,470",Yes.
324,"00:21:47,960","00:21:49,300",Okay.
325,"00:22:03,140","00:22:04,900","Hey, cady. What's up?"
326,"00:22:05,040","00:22:06,320",Give me five.
327,"00:22:09,250","00:22:11,050","Oh, come on.
You can do better than that."
328,"00:22:12,910","00:22:15,300","Ouch, girl. Not so hard."
329,"00:22:15,500","00:22:17,440",How does he work?
330,"00:22:17,640","00:22:20,130","Are you sure you want to know?
It might freak you out."
331,"00:22:20,330","00:22:22,370",I won't get freaked out.
332,"00:22:23,410","00:22:24,550",Okay.
333,"00:22:28,170","00:22:30,000",Let's see what we've got here.
334,"00:22:31,240","00:22:34,560","Okay.
These are stereoscopic cameras."
335,"00:22:34,760","00:22:37,560",That is a laser. That's radar.
336,"00:22:37,760","00:22:41,570","These are bump sensors, so he can tell the
difference between a human and a hard surface."
337,"00:22:41,770","00:22:45,290","And this little block right here
is where all of his thoughts go."
338,"00:22:45,490","00:22:47,020",It's his brain? Yeah.
339,"00:22:47,220","00:22:50,060","And this is a spectrometer,
which means he can even smell."
340,"00:22:50,260","00:22:52,060",I can't believe you made this.
341,"00:22:52,260","00:22:54,160",Yeah. He's pretty cool.
342,"00:22:54,360","00:22:56,826","But the problem with toys like
Bruce is that they're so expensive,"
343,"00:22:56,850","00:22:58,860","and most kids
can't afford to have one."
344,"00:22:59,060","00:23:00,650","If I had a toy like Bruce,"
345,"00:23:00,850","00:23:03,270","I Don't think I'd ever
need another toy again."
346,"00:23:51,590","00:23:54,160","Okay, so we've got this one
or the one with the bangs."
347,"00:23:54,360","00:23:57,400","A little bit of auburn chic. I really think
you gotta revisit this."
348,"00:23:57,600","00:23:59,430","- No, absolutely not.
- Look at that."
349,"00:24:03,820","00:24:05,720","Hold on just a second. No, no, no."
350,"00:24:08,930","00:24:10,650","- Shit.
- What is this?"
351,"00:24:10,850","00:24:11,850",Where's Gemma?
352,"00:24:11,960","00:24:13,830",Where's my prototype?
353,"00:24:14,030","00:24:18,350","Uh, David, I just wanna be exceedingly
clear that this was not my idea."
354,"00:24:26,700","00:24:28,980","Cady, there's someone
I want you to meet."
355,"00:24:30,950","00:24:33,510","Do you remember
how much you liked Bruce?"
356,"00:24:33,710","00:24:36,680","I think you're gonna like m3gan
even more."
357,"00:24:36,880","00:24:40,340","You see, Bruce requires
someone else to operate him,"
358,"00:24:40,540","00:24:43,620",but m3gan works all on her own.
359,"00:24:45,310","00:24:47,660","Okay, what I want you to do"
360,"00:24:47,860","00:24:49,870","is take your fingers
and put them here."
361,"00:24:50,070","00:24:52,970","And when you do that,
you're gonna pair with her."
362,"00:24:53,170","00:24:55,460","That means she'll recognize you
as her primary user."
363,"00:24:55,660","00:24:58,150",She's yours and yours alone.
364,"00:24:58,350","00:25:00,460",So just keep your fingers there
365,"00:25:00,660","00:25:02,220",and say your name.
366,"00:25:03,670","00:25:06,020","Hi, m3gan. I'm cady."
367,"00:25:08,160","00:25:09,990","It's nice to meet you, cady."
368,"00:25:15,090","00:25:17,170","Ooh, I like that jacket.
Where'd you get it?"
369,"00:25:18,550","00:25:21,480","I'm not sure.
I can't remember."
370,"00:25:21,680","00:25:24,760","Oh. Well, anyway,
it looks good on you."
371,"00:25:24,960","00:25:26,110",Do you wanna hang out?
372,"00:25:28,660","00:25:29,730",Okay.
373,"00:25:52,370","00:25:53,550",Shall we draw?
374,"00:25:53,750","00:25:55,690",What are you going to draw?
375,"00:25:55,890","00:25:57,450",See if you can guess.
376,"00:26:20,950","00:26:22,610",There's nothing there.
377,"00:26:22,810","00:26:24,820",Oh. I'm sorry.
378,"00:26:44,110","00:26:45,910","Do you like it, cady?"
379,"00:26:48,980","00:26:50,090",I love it.
380,"00:26:50,290","00:26:52,120",Jesus.
381,"00:26:54,820","00:26:56,470",This is incredible.
382,"00:26:57,470","00:26:58,510","I mean,"
383,"00:26:59,410","00:27:01,830","this is unbelievable, isn't it?"
384,"00:27:02,030","00:27:03,620","Yeah, it is."
385,"00:27:05,830","00:27:07,310",How did you do this?
386,"00:27:07,510","00:27:09,250",I thought you didn't wanna know.
387,"00:27:09,450","00:27:12,320","That wasn't a simulation, right?
That kid's not an actress?"
388,"00:27:12,520","00:27:14,220","No, that's my niece, cady."
389,"00:27:14,420","00:27:16,706","We need to get this in front of
the board. I was just gonna say..."
390,"00:27:16,730","00:27:19,630","But first things first,
let's talk manufacturing costs."
391,"00:27:20,360","00:27:22,160",More or less than a Tesla?
392,"00:27:22,360","00:27:23,360",Um...
393,"00:27:24,500","00:27:25,700","Depends on the model, I guess."
394,"00:27:25,880","00:27:27,360","Okay, I'm in."
395,"00:27:28,060","00:27:29,540",I'm all in.
396,"00:27:29,740","00:27:31,476","But we're asking the board
to invest in something"
397,"00:27:31,500","00:27:33,370","that's not gonna see a profit
for three years."
398,"00:27:33,570","00:27:36,340","So bottom line is, this isn't
going anywhere without Greg."
399,"00:27:36,540","00:27:38,900","- He's the chairman.
- Yeah, I know who Greg is, Kurt."
400,"00:27:39,100","00:27:42,210","Now, Greg is a hard-ass
when it comes to spending money."
401,"00:27:42,410","00:27:45,700","But here's the thing, he's got a kid
who's about the same age as your niece."
402,"00:27:45,900","00:27:48,390","If we can show him
what you just showed me"
403,"00:27:48,590","00:27:51,810","and get him to respond
emotionally instead of analytically,"
404,"00:27:52,010","00:27:53,710",we should be off to the races.
405,"00:27:53,910","00:27:56,670","So, can we keep the girl?
Can we make her part of it?"
406,"00:27:56,870","00:27:59,500","She's paired with her, right?
That's how this whole thing works?"
407,"00:27:59,700","00:28:02,700","Yeah, the more time she spends with
cady, the more effective she's gonna be."
408,"00:28:02,740","00:28:04,960","Love it.
Kurt, get shelley on the phone."
409,"00:28:05,160","00:28:07,360","Gem, get me a list of things
I can say in a presentation"
410,"00:28:07,440","00:28:09,616","that makes it sound like
I know what I'm talking about."
411,"00:28:09,640","00:28:10,760","Holy shit, this is exciting."
412,"00:28:10,920","00:28:12,440","I want you all
to remember this moment."
413,"00:28:12,540","00:28:15,240","The moment we kicked hasbro
right in the dick."
414,"00:28:18,860","00:28:21,910","The new model 3
generative Android from funki"
415,"00:28:22,110","00:28:25,530","is a fully autonomous humanoid
robot with features never before seen"
416,"00:28:25,730","00:28:27,740",in the consumer market.
417,"00:28:27,940","00:28:30,706","Here are all of aunt Gemma's
collectibles, and this one is my favorite."
418,"00:28:30,730","00:28:33,300","Oh! I have more awesome toys
in my room. Come on. Come on."
419,"00:28:33,500","00:28:35,890","Sculpted from a titanium core,"
420,"00:28:36,090","00:28:39,440","m3gan's designed to withstand
whatever life can throw at her."
421,"00:28:39,640","00:28:42,410","She comes equipped
with an a17 bionic fusion chip"
422,"00:28:42,610","00:28:46,760","and can be fully customized through
six different silicone skin pigmentations."
423,"00:28:46,960","00:28:50,690","But the most exciting aspects about
m3gan are the features still to come."
424,"00:28:50,890","00:28:53,250","Through our own unique approach
to probabilistic inference,"
425,"00:28:53,380","00:28:56,460","m3gan is on a constant quest
for self-improvement."
426,"00:28:56,660","00:28:59,630","Whether it's diagnosing children
with specific learning differences"
427,"00:28:59,830","00:29:02,880","or merely reminding them of
the way science is all around us..."
428,"00:29:03,080","00:29:04,780","Cady, you should use a coaster."
429,"00:29:04,980","00:29:06,740",Why do I have to use a coaster?
430,"00:29:06,940","00:29:10,710","Coasters help to avoid water
marks, especially on wooden surfaces."
431,"00:29:10,910","00:29:15,270","- But how does the water get outside the glass?
- That's a great question, cady."
432,"00:29:15,470","00:29:18,310","It's actually caused by the difference
in temperature outside the glass,"
433,"00:29:18,470","00:29:19,960","which pulls moisture
from the air."
434,"00:29:20,160","00:29:21,160",Crazy.
435,"00:29:21,340","00:29:23,420","It's insane, right?"
436,"00:29:23,620","00:29:27,350","Studies indicate that a
staggering 78% of a parent's time"
437,"00:29:27,550","00:29:29,800","is spent dishing out
the same basic instructions."
438,"00:29:30,000","00:29:34,080","Oh, my god. Cady, you have to
flush the toilet. It is not that hard."
439,"00:29:34,280","00:29:36,080","So we found someone else
to pick up the slack."
440,"00:29:36,150","00:29:37,600","Cady, flush the toilet."
441,"00:29:40,390","00:29:41,390",Wash your hands.
442,"00:29:41,460","00:29:43,330",Roll up your sleeves.
443,"00:29:46,990","00:29:48,300",Great job.
444,"00:29:48,500","00:29:49,996","It was my friend
Jenny's birthday."
445,"00:29:50,020","00:29:51,540",M3gan's an excellent listener.
446,"00:29:51,610","00:29:53,516","This guy told them
that the 13th floor was haunted."
447,"00:29:53,540","00:29:55,100",Right. and they accidentally...
448,"00:29:55,300","00:29:57,260","And she even has
a few stories of her own."
449,"00:29:57,340","00:29:59,660","""If it was so, it might be,"
450,"00:29:59,720","00:30:03,280","and if it were so, it would be, but
as it isn't, it ain't. That's logic."""
451,"00:30:03,480","00:30:04,760","""Said tweedledee."""
452,"00:30:04,830","00:30:06,270",She'll never run out of ways
453,"00:30:06,380","00:30:07,840","to keep your child occupied,"
454,"00:30:08,040","00:30:09,630","and she'll never
run out of Patience."
455,"00:30:09,830","00:30:12,530","Cady. Seriously,
flush the toilet."
456,"00:30:22,570","00:30:25,550","With m3gan around,
she'll take care of the little things,"
457,"00:30:25,750","00:30:29,060","so you can spend more time
doing the things that matter."
458,"00:30:30,310","00:30:32,210","And then it can end
with something like,"
459,"00:30:32,410","00:30:35,350","""m3gan. She's more than just
a toy. She's part of the family."""
460,"00:30:35,550","00:30:38,250","Looks good. You're not gonna
do the voice though, right?"
461,"00:30:38,450","00:30:40,810","No. Obviously, David's gonna
make up his own version of it."
462,"00:30:40,970","00:30:44,220","I just want him to be aware
of what it is that he's selling."
463,"00:30:44,420","00:30:46,600","Tess,
your silence indicates what?"
464,"00:30:47,500","00:30:49,020",I... I Don't know.
465,"00:30:49,220","00:30:51,050","- I'm not sure.
- About what?"
466,"00:30:51,250","00:30:53,400","Well, why would you want
m3gan to do all that stuff?"
467,"00:30:53,600","00:30:56,520","They're emergent capabilities.
She'll be able to do all of that and more."
468,"00:30:56,710","00:30:59,100","Okay, well,
does any of that bother you?"
469,"00:30:59,300","00:31:03,070","I thought we were creating a tool to
help support parents, not replace them."
470,"00:31:03,270","00:31:06,730","If you're having m3gan tuck cady
in and read her a bedtime story,"
471,"00:31:06,930","00:31:10,320","then when are you ever spending
time with her or even talking with her?"
472,"00:31:10,520","00:31:12,560","I Don't really think
this is any of your business."
473,"00:31:13,310","00:31:15,600","Well, it is."
474,"00:31:15,800","00:31:18,670","If you're spending less time with
your child as a result of m3gan,"
475,"00:31:18,870","00:31:21,700","- that is something we should be aware of.
- She's not my child."
476,"00:31:24,740","00:31:27,230","Look, you know how hard I've
been working on this presentation."
477,"00:31:27,430","00:31:29,546","As soon as it's over
and the board agrees to proceed,"
478,"00:31:29,570","00:31:31,890","then we can establish
some kind of balance."
479,"00:31:32,090","00:31:35,136","But for now, it's important that cady and
m3gan spend as much time as possible together."
480,"00:31:35,160","00:31:37,486","By the way, I Don't think
it's having detrimental effects,"
481,"00:31:37,510","00:31:40,030","because she's the happiest
she's been since her parents died."
482,"00:31:40,230","00:31:41,630",How did cady's parents die?
483,"00:31:41,750","00:31:43,730","- Whoa.
- I thought she was turned off."
484,"00:31:43,930","00:31:45,560","Yeah, m3gan, turn off."
485,"00:31:45,760","00:31:48,970","Cady James. Daughter of
Nicole and Ryan James."
486,"00:31:49,170","00:31:52,150","Killed in a collision on
interstate 84 outside of Oregon."
487,"00:31:52,350","00:31:53,770",Why is she doing that?
488,"00:31:53,970","00:31:55,430","Shit, she's still
paired with cady."
489,"00:31:55,630","00:31:57,530","You didn't code in
parental controls?"
490,"00:31:57,730","00:32:00,226","I didn't have time to implement
them before we went live. Hold on."
491,"00:32:00,250","00:32:03,640","M3gan, if you have data requests,
you have to engage with the protocols."
492,"00:32:03,840","00:32:06,580","I Don't have a framework to speak
with cady on the subject of death."
493,"00:32:06,780","00:32:08,610","Yes, I know.
We're looking into it."
494,"00:32:08,810","00:32:11,650","- Gathering auxiliary Internet data on death.
- I meant at a later point."
495,"00:32:11,850","00:32:14,070","Calculating its
vector representation."
496,"00:32:14,270","00:32:16,310",Death is the end of life. Holy shit.
497,"00:32:16,510","00:32:19,070","The total and permanent
cessation of all vital functions."
498,"00:32:19,270","00:32:22,250","Yes, but let's not make a big
deal out of it. Everything dies."
499,"00:32:23,700","00:32:25,110",Will I die?
500,"00:32:25,310","00:32:27,320","Actually, let's just
avoid this topic altogether."
501,"00:32:27,520","00:32:31,600","Your goal is to protect cady from
harm, both physical and emotional."
502,"00:32:31,800","00:32:33,260",Is the input request received?
503,"00:32:34,980","00:32:36,190",M3gan.
504,"00:32:36,390","00:32:37,680","Yes, Gemma."

my second primary user."
506,"00:32:40,810","00:32:43,200",Fantastic. Turn off.
507,"00:32:46,650","00:32:48,130",I'm gonna go get a coffee.

523,"00:34:01,000","00:34:02,900",Gotcha. You're dead.
524,"00:34:05,250","00:34:07,040","M3gan, what's wrong?"

544,"00:35:38,680","00:35:41,970","I swear to god, if you Don't put your
dog down, I'm gonna do it for you, Celia."
545,"00:35:42,170","00:35:44,730","Gemma,
cady's temperature is rising."
546,"00:35:44,930","00:35:47,630","Her wound needs to be
disinfected immediately."
547,"00:35:47,830","00:35:50,490","This wouldn't have happened
if you'd fixed the fence!"
548,"00:36:07,570","00:36:10,580","Are you kidding me? Her
entire arm looks like a dental mold,"
549,"00:36:10,780","00:36:13,100","and you're telling me that
there's nothing that we can do?"
550,"00:36:13,300","00:36:14,900",She said he was provoked. Provoked?
551,"00:36:15,100","00:36:17,240","Have you seen this dog?
It is a monster."
552,"00:36:17,440","00:36:19,620","I'm chasing it off of my
property every other day."
553,"00:36:19,820","00:36:22,490","She said
he's never on your property."
554,"00:36:22,690","00:36:25,356","Then why Don't you ask her whose shit I'm
cleaning off of my driveway? Because it's not mine."
555,"00:36:25,380","00:36:27,536","Look, the dog doesn't
have a history of violence."
556,"00:36:27,560","00:36:29,360","State law says
he can't forcibly be put down."
557,"00:36:29,560","00:36:31,330","Okay,
then what am I supposed to do?"
558,"00:36:31,530","00:36:33,810",Fix the hole in your fence?
559,"00:37:00,310","00:37:01,700",Dewey!
560,"00:37:02,870","00:37:04,390","Dewey, boy!"
561,"00:37:06,360","00:37:07,430",Dewey!
562,"00:37:07,630","00:37:10,120","Come here, boy. Come on."
563,"00:37:36,460","00:37:37,800",Dewey!
564,"00:37:38,770","00:37:40,460","Dewey, bubs."
565,"00:37:44,530","00:37:45,740",Dewey!
566,"00:37:47,570","00:37:49,190",Dewey.
567,"00:37:51,820","00:37:53,480",Dewey!
568,"00:37:53,680","00:37:55,580",Dewey!
569,"00:37:57,370","00:37:58,930",Dew!
570,"00:37:59,960","00:38:01,520","Dewey, boy."
571,"00:38:21,570","00:38:22,570",Hey.
572,"00:38:26,680","00:38:28,060",How are you feeling?
573,"00:38:28,260","00:38:30,340",Okay.
574,"00:38:30,540","00:38:31,690",It's sore.
575,"00:38:31,890","00:38:34,140","The pain will subside
after a few days."
576,"00:38:34,340","00:38:37,580","In the meantime, Don't forget to take your
antibiotics and drink plenty of fluids."
577,"00:38:37,650","00:38:39,000","Yeah. Thanks, m3gan."
578,"00:38:39,200","00:38:41,000","And be sure
to get plenty of rest."
579,"00:38:43,070","00:38:46,180","You know, I think m3gan's right.
You should probably get some rest."
580,"00:38:46,380","00:38:47,530","But, um,"
581,"00:38:48,670","00:38:50,740","remember we have
that demonstration today?"
582,"00:38:51,740","00:38:54,050","Do you think that
you'll be up for it?"
583,"00:38:54,250","00:38:57,330","You Don't have to do it
if you Don't wanna do it."
584,"00:38:59,370","00:39:03,200","I mean, there are people who flew
across the country especially to see it,"
585,"00:39:03,400","00:39:06,100","but if you're not up to it, I'd
just rather you tell me now, okay?"
586,"00:39:08,480","00:39:09,480",I'll be all right.
587,"00:39:11,650","00:39:13,900",Okay.
588,"00:39:21,250","00:39:24,670","Every interactive toy
that's ever been made"
589,"00:39:24,870","00:39:28,880","has been a variation
on the same basic formula."
590,"00:39:29,080","00:39:31,230","A series of
preprogrammed responses"
591,"00:39:31,430","00:39:33,370","initiated
by the push of a button."
592,"00:39:33,570","00:39:36,170","Never before
in the history of these products"
593,"00:39:36,370","00:39:40,930","has there been a talking doll you
could actually have a conversation with."
594,"00:39:41,130","00:39:43,590",But what if there was a toy
595,"00:39:43,790","00:39:47,800","that did have
genuine spontaneous response?"
596,"00:39:48,000","00:39:50,040",That had a mind all of its own?
597,"00:39:50,240","00:39:53,870","That looked and behaved
exactly like a real child?"
598,"00:39:55,280","00:39:57,980","I mean, a toy like that
wouldn't come cheap."
599,"00:39:58,770","00:40:00,050","But as of next year,"
600,"00:40:00,250","00:40:02,570","it's gonna be
the only toy that matters."
601,"00:40:02,770","00:40:04,230","Ladies and gentlemen,"
602,"00:40:04,430","00:40:07,710","she's the apex
of 21st-century technology"
603,"00:40:07,910","00:40:10,480","wrapped up
in four feet of silicone."
604,"00:40:10,680","00:40:11,890",And her name...
605,"00:40:12,650","00:40:14,230",Is m3gan.
606,"00:40:19,760","00:40:20,760","Hey, cady."
607,"00:40:22,520","00:40:23,590","Hi, m3gan."
608,"00:40:29,970","00:40:33,640","So, how would you like to help
me make a flower decoration"
609,"00:40:33,840","00:40:37,220","with nothing more than some
colored paper and a rubber band?"
610,"00:40:42,400","00:40:43,440",Cady?
611,"00:40:48,340","00:40:50,130","Why are you sad, cady?"
612,"00:40:50,750","00:40:51,860",Is it your arm?
613,"00:40:52,510","00:40:54,000",Is it still sore?
614,"00:40:55,660","00:40:57,040",Then what is it?
615,"00:41:00,140","00:41:04,120","It's just that every day
I wake up in this strange house,"
616,"00:41:04,320","00:41:06,670","and I remember
that my parents are dead."
617,"00:41:06,870","00:41:09,600","It's like
it's happening all over again."
618,"00:41:09,800","00:41:11,570",I miss them so much.
619,"00:41:11,770","00:41:14,880","I'm worried that I'll forget
all the things we did together."
620,"00:41:15,080","00:41:19,370","That one day I'll be looking at pictures
of my mom like she's some stranger."
621,"00:41:31,480","00:41:34,970","Tell me something about your mom.
Something that makes you happy."
622,"00:41:37,840","00:41:39,220",I Don't know.
623,"00:41:40,670","00:41:42,670",I can't think of one thing.
624,"00:41:43,320","00:41:44,670",Just try.
625,"00:41:47,670","00:41:51,160","One time, she found a cockroach
in my schoolbag."
626,"00:41:51,360","00:41:54,270","She was upset 'cause I
didn't eat my sandwiches."
627,"00:41:56,200","00:41:59,200","And then all of a sudden,
this thing crawls up her wrist,"
628,"00:41:59,400","00:42:01,480","and she just started
screaming like a maniac"
629,"00:42:01,680","00:42:03,380",and ran out of the house.
630,"00:42:05,350","00:42:06,730",That was pretty funny.
631,"00:42:08,070","00:42:11,350","Okay, so that's a memory
you won't ever forget."
632,"00:42:12,010","00:42:13,080",What do you mean?
633,"00:42:13,280","00:42:15,080",I mean I'm keeping it for you...
634,"00:42:16,390","00:42:17,430",Here.
635,"00:42:19,080","00:42:21,990","One time, she
found a cockroach in my schoolbag."
636,"00:42:22,190","00:42:25,160","She was upset 'cause I
didn't eat my sandwiches."
637,"00:42:25,360","00:42:28,860","And then all of a sudden,
this thing crawls up her wrist,"
638,"00:42:29,060","00:42:30,860","and she just started
screaming like a maniac"
639,"00:42:31,060","00:42:32,860",and ran out of the house.
640,"00:42:33,060","00:42:34,790",That was pretty funny.
641,"00:42:34,990","00:42:38,760","Anytime you wanna tell me
something special about your parents,"
642,"00:42:38,960","00:42:41,320","something funny or sad
or anything at all,"
643,"00:42:41,520","00:42:42,730","you just tell me,"
644,"00:42:42,930","00:42:44,460",and I'll keep it safe.
645,"00:42:44,660","00:42:48,050","And we can listen to it
whenever we want."
646,"00:43:32,710","00:43:35,060","Gemma,
would you give us a minute?"
647,"00:43:36,640","00:43:38,090","So, what do you think?"
648,"00:43:39,680","00:43:41,690","I think the world's about to
shift on its axis."
649,"00:43:41,890","00:43:44,656","But if we wanna stay ahead of that
shift, we're gonna have to move fast."
650,"00:43:44,680","00:43:46,310",That means no leaks.
651,"00:43:46,510","00:43:48,666","We need to launch this before
anyone can steal it from us."
652,"00:43:48,690","00:43:50,010",So let me make a pitch.
653,"00:43:50,210","00:43:51,900","We do a live stream
in two weeks."
654,"00:43:52,100","00:43:54,526","That way, we can get the presale
vouchers out before Christmas."
655,"00:43:54,550","00:43:55,770",How ready is she?
656,"00:43:55,970","00:43:57,650","Will she hold up
to a public demonstration?"
657,"00:43:57,800","00:44:00,460","Uh, I'd like to do
a little more testing,"
658,"00:44:00,660","00:44:02,330","but, yeah, I think
I can make that work."
659,"00:44:02,530","00:44:04,400",All right. Let's do it.
660,"00:44:04,600","00:44:07,330","And, David, I think we need to get
Gemma in front of someone at legal."
661,"00:44:07,530","00:44:08,610",You bet.
662,"00:44:08,810","00:44:10,720","Uh, wait... wait, why...
Why is that?"
663,"00:44:10,920","00:44:12,370","Because as of right now,"
664,"00:44:12,570","00:44:14,580","she's the most valuable asset
this company has,"
665,"00:44:14,780","00:44:18,130","and I think she might wanna be
renegotiating her contract."
666,"00:44:43,640","00:44:44,710",Kurt.
667,"00:44:46,820","00:44:48,996","You weren't ""pornhub-ing""
in the office again, were you?"
668,"00:44:49,020","00:44:52,030",No.
669,"00:44:54,860","00:44:57,076","We need to put something on
the books between gem and legal."
670,"00:44:57,100","00:45:00,830","And what are we doing
about lunch? Uh, I'll get some menus."
671,"00:45:09,560","00:45:12,120","One, two,
three, four, I declare a thumb war."
672,"00:45:12,320","00:45:14,470",Your thumb's so slippery.
673,"00:45:14,670","00:45:17,270","Cady, you should have some of
your hot dog before it gets too cold."
674,"00:45:17,430","00:45:19,890","Come on, thumb. Come on."
675,"00:45:20,090","00:45:22,300",Cady? Your hot dog.
676,"00:45:26,240","00:45:29,001","Hey, I'm sorry about today. I
shouldn't have put you in that position"
677,"00:45:29,130","00:45:31,240","if you weren't feeling
up to it."
678,"00:45:31,440","00:45:33,700","It worked out, didn't
it? Three, two, one, I win!"
679,"00:45:33,900","00:45:35,250",Hey!
680,"00:45:35,450","00:45:37,870","Anyway, I just wanted
to say that... hey, hey!"
681,"00:45:38,070","00:45:39,670","M3gan, turn off."
682,"00:45:39,870","00:45:41,250",Why did you do that?
683,"00:45:41,450","00:45:43,290","M3gan, turn on."
684,"00:45:43,490","00:45:45,886","Because I'm trying to have a
conversation with you. M3gan, turn off."
685,"00:45:46,940","00:45:48,600",Just give me one minute.
686,"00:45:50,710","00:45:55,060","I know that this, um, hasn't
been easy for either of us."
687,"00:45:55,260","00:45:56,930",This transition.
688,"00:45:57,130","00:45:59,310","But if you ever need to
talk about any of that stuff..."
689,"00:45:59,510","00:46:01,100",I already did talk about it.
690,"00:46:01,300","00:46:03,790","Yeah, but m3gan's not a
person, cady. She's a toy."
691,"00:46:03,990","00:46:06,660","- You Don't get to say that.
- What?"
692,"00:46:06,860","00:46:10,420","I said I Don't wanna talk about
it. I wanna turn m3gan back on."
693,"00:46:10,620","00:46:12,490","M3gan, turn on. what's up?"
694,"00:46:12,690","00:46:14,460","So there's this new game
called tic-tac-toe."
695,"00:46:14,660","00:46:17,180","You put your hand like this.
Go like this, this."
696,"00:46:28,440","00:46:30,990","Would you like to tell me
what these drawings mean to you?"
697,"00:46:32,990","00:46:35,890","There's no wrong answer.
Any thoughts you have are okay."
698,"00:46:38,270","00:46:40,590","Or maybe you Don't have
any specific thoughts."
699,"00:46:40,790","00:46:42,450",Maybe it's more of a feeling.
700,"00:46:43,660","00:46:45,660",Like anger?
701,"00:46:46,660","00:46:48,460",Or confusion?
702,"00:46:50,630","00:46:53,360","Maybe you're struggling
to find meaning in any of this."
703,"00:47:04,130","00:47:06,030",You made her cry.
704,"00:47:08,340","00:47:10,240",That was not my intention.
705,"00:47:11,410","00:47:13,960","And yet, that's what happened."
706,"00:47:25,630","00:47:27,530",She's very impressive.
707,"00:47:27,730","00:47:29,330","Yeah, thank you."
708,"00:47:29,530","00:47:31,980","We're still in beta,
but we're all pretty excited."
709,"00:47:33,260","00:47:35,230","And so they spend quite
a bit of time together?"
710,"00:47:35,430","00:47:37,070","Yeah, that's essentially
how m3gan works."
711,"00:47:37,160","00:47:39,650","She has to be paired with
a child in order to learn."
712,"00:47:39,850","00:47:42,790","But m3gan's actually been
pretty instrumental"
713,"00:47:42,990","00:47:44,930","in helping cady
get over the loss."
714,"00:47:45,130","00:47:47,310","It's honestly like
she's part of the family now."
715,"00:47:47,510","00:47:48,520",Right.
716,"00:47:52,000","00:47:54,180","Do you know anything
about attachment theory?"
717,"00:47:55,140","00:47:57,220","When a child loses a parent,"
718,"00:47:57,420","00:48:00,436","they look to form attachments with
the next person that comes into their life."
719,"00:48:00,460","00:48:03,850","The person that's gonna
provide love and support"
720,"00:48:04,050","00:48:05,950",and serve as a behavioral model.
721,"00:48:06,150","00:48:10,090","Which, in an ordinary situation,
would be you, right?"
722,"00:48:10,290","00:48:13,540","But you've created a toy
that's so real,"
723,"00:48:13,740","00:48:17,070","it's possible that cady
might not see her as a toy"
724,"00:48:17,270","00:48:19,450",but as a primary caregiver.
725,"00:48:19,650","00:48:22,410","I guess I just Don't quite see
what the end goal is here."
726,"00:48:23,620","00:48:26,800","If you make a toy
that's impossible to let go of,"
727,"00:48:27,000","00:48:28,900","then how do you ever
expect a child to grow?"
728,"00:48:30,110","00:48:32,180","As remarkable as she is,"
729,"00:48:32,380","00:48:34,460","and... and she is remarkable,"
730,"00:48:34,660","00:48:37,840","you could be building emotional
connections with this doll"
731,"00:48:38,040","00:48:39,600",that are too hard to untangle.
732,"00:48:40,770","00:48:42,430",Very good job.
733,"00:48:46,820","00:48:49,440","You have to eat the toppings,
cady, not just the bread."
734,"00:48:54,550","00:48:56,790","You just did the one thing
I asked you not to do."
735,"00:48:56,990","00:48:59,271","Research shows that if you
force a child to eat vegetables,"
736,"00:48:59,380","00:49:01,940","then they'll be less likely
to choose those foods as adults."
737,"00:49:02,140","00:49:03,940","- Is that so?
- Yes."
738,"00:49:04,140","00:49:07,050","Experts say the preferred method
is to give your child the choice."
739,"00:49:07,250","00:49:10,430","It's called the division
of responsibility..."
740,"00:49:10,630","00:49:12,150",So we need to talk about school.
741,"00:49:13,460","00:49:15,120","Mom didn't want me
to go to school."
742,"00:49:15,320","00:49:17,260",She said I learn better at home.
743,"00:49:17,460","00:49:19,540","I know, and I'm not saying
that she was wrong."
744,"00:49:19,740","00:49:22,650","I'm learning faster with m3gan
than I ever have before."
745,"00:49:22,850","00:49:24,480","We're already
on fourth-grade math."
746,"00:49:24,680","00:49:26,510","But it's about
more than just grades, cady."
747,"00:49:26,710","00:49:28,900","It's about
developing social skills,"
748,"00:49:29,100","00:49:30,780","and that is something
that you can only get"
749,"00:49:30,860","00:49:32,760","from spending time
around other kids."
750,"00:49:32,960","00:49:34,100",Real kids.
751,"00:49:35,140","00:49:36,320",I found this place.
752,"00:49:36,520","00:49:38,250","It's kind of
an alternative school."
753,"00:49:38,450","00:49:40,980",You get to learn outdoors.
754,"00:49:41,180","00:49:43,430","And it's just for kids
who are exactly like you,"
755,"00:49:43,630","00:49:45,330",kids who think outside the box.
756,"00:49:45,530","00:49:47,950","And they're having a day for
prospective students tomorrow."
757,"00:49:48,770","00:49:49,950",Can I bring m3gan?
758,"00:49:50,150","00:49:52,130","Cady,
you know that's not possible."
759,"00:49:52,330","00:49:54,200","- Then I'm not going.
- Oh, come on, cady."
760,"00:49:54,400","00:49:56,440","You can't make me
do something I Don't wanna do."
761,"00:49:56,640","00:49:59,200","Actually, I can. That's
basically what a guardian does."
762,"00:50:01,200","00:50:03,170","Hey, I'm sorry.
Let's just talk about it."
763,"00:50:03,370","00:50:04,970","- Hey, hey, hey.
- Let me go!"
764,"00:50:05,170","00:50:07,970","- Whoa. Hey. What's going on? Hey, cady!
- Let me go!"
765,"00:50:08,170","00:50:09,520",What are you doing? Stop it!
766,"00:50:09,720","00:50:11,380","- Cady, calm down!
- Let her go!"
767,"00:50:17,110","00:50:19,840","You are not to interfere with
users' private conversations."
768,"00:50:20,040","00:50:21,040",Is that clear?
769,"00:50:21,110","00:50:22,360",Hundred percent.
770,"00:50:23,840","00:50:25,400",Recalibrating response model.
771,"00:50:25,600","00:50:26,600","M3gan, turn off."
772,"00:50:27,640","00:50:28,850",Are you sure?
773,"00:50:29,570","00:50:30,950",Download in progress.
774,"00:50:50,070","00:50:51,670","Cady,
this is getting ridiculous."
775,"00:50:51,730","00:50:53,910","I'm supposed to be
at work already."
776,"00:50:54,110","00:50:56,740","You're gonna have fun
once you get into it."
777,"00:50:56,940","00:50:59,500","I'm not going.
Not without m3gan."
778,"00:50:59,700","00:51:02,020","Okay, a,
that is never gonna happen"
779,"00:51:02,220","00:51:05,220","and b, the launch is in less than a
week. I have to take her to work with me."
780,"00:51:05,300","00:51:07,656","We have to run diagnostics.
I have to do a wardrobe fitting."
781,"00:51:07,680","00:51:09,410","I thought you said
she was mine alone."
782,"00:51:09,610","00:51:13,100","Hey! Do we have some
new adventurers with us today?"
783,"00:51:13,300","00:51:14,480","Yes, this is cady."
784,"00:51:14,680","00:51:16,650",And who's this? Your sister?
785,"00:51:17,410","00:51:18,590","Oh, Jesus Christ!"
786,"00:51:19,550","00:51:20,550",Sorry.
787,"00:51:20,660","00:51:22,420",Is that a doll?
788,"00:51:22,620","00:51:25,290","Her name's m3gan. She wants
to know if she can come with us."
789,"00:51:25,490","00:51:28,150","No, she doesn't. M3gan's
gonna stay with me today. Cady..."
790,"00:51:28,350","00:51:32,570","Well, we do have a toy table where the kids
leave their dolls and things like that."
791,"00:51:32,770","00:51:34,260","Um, but that is up to you."
792,"00:51:34,460","00:51:36,090","She's actually
a working prototype,"
793,"00:51:36,290","00:51:38,440","so I shouldn't even
have her out in public."
794,"00:51:38,640","00:51:41,030","Well, if you did want to stay
and keep an eye on her,"
795,"00:51:41,230","00:51:43,270","we could use some help
making sandwiches!"
796,"00:51:43,470","00:51:45,000","Don't worry, Gemma."
797,"00:51:45,200","00:51:47,380","You have equipped me with
advanced dual-frequency GPS."
798,"00:51:47,580","00:51:48,960",So I won't get lost.
799,"00:51:50,620","00:51:52,100","Please, Gemma?"
800,"00:51:54,110","00:51:56,560","Okay.
But she stays at the toy table,"
801,"00:51:56,760","00:51:58,910","and as far as anyone is
concerned, that's all she is."
802,"00:51:59,110","00:52:00,420",And just no pictures.
803,"00:52:02,080","00:52:03,980",That is seriously cool.
804,"00:52:12,950","00:52:16,440","Okay, now who here
likes roasted chestnuts?"
805,"00:52:16,640","00:52:18,580",What do you say we go find some?
806,"00:52:18,780","00:52:20,310",Yeah!
807,"00:52:20,510","00:52:22,150",Isn't this great?
808,"00:52:22,230","00:52:25,240","I wish we had things like this
when we were kids."
809,"00:52:25,440","00:52:28,520","So great to get them out in the
fresh air and off those devices."
810,"00:52:28,720","00:52:31,140",I can't get this open.
811,"00:52:32,970","00:52:36,120","And the thing is, they love it.
My son prefers it to regular school."
812,"00:52:36,320","00:52:37,810",Which one is yours?
813,"00:52:38,010","00:52:40,020",The one in the flannel shirt.
814,"00:52:40,220","00:52:41,470","Oh, my god. How old is he?"
815,"00:52:41,670","00:52:43,470","I know.
He had a growth spurt last year."
816,"00:52:43,670","00:52:46,230","But he's actually
quite a sensitive little soul."
817,"00:52:46,430","00:52:49,370","Brandon, honey! Are you warm
enough? Do you need your hat?"
818,"00:52:49,570","00:52:50,610","Fuck off, Holly."
819,"00:52:53,200","00:52:55,650","Well, you could
just say ""no, thank you."""
820,"00:52:55,850","00:52:57,316","Never know
what they're gonna say next."
821,"00:52:57,340","00:53:00,310","Yeah, it's such a fun age.Yeah."
822,"00:53:00,510","00:53:02,490","So,
I'm gonna put you into pairs."
823,"00:53:02,690","00:53:05,150","Uh, Felix,
you can go with Brandon. Yeah?"
824,"00:53:05,350","00:53:07,310","Please,
I Don't wanna go with Brandon."
825,"00:53:07,380","00:53:09,630","Okay. No, no.
That's okay. That's okay."
826,"00:53:09,830","00:53:13,050","Um, Brandon, why Don't
you go with cady? Okay?"
827,"00:53:13,250","00:53:16,020","Felix, you can go with Oliver.
All right? Thanks, buddy."
828,"00:53:16,220","00:53:17,370",All right. Now...
829,"00:53:17,570","00:53:18,780","Ooh, your coat looks great."
830,"00:53:18,980","00:53:20,580","Are you ready to find chestnuts
in that?"
831,"00:53:20,780","00:53:22,710",Yeah? Nice and warm. Bundled up.
832,"00:53:41,450","00:53:42,700","Oh, I'm sorry."
833,"00:53:42,900","00:53:44,700","Here, you can have it."
834,"00:53:45,390","00:53:46,770",Careful. It's spiky.
835,"00:53:49,430","00:53:50,850",Ow! Stop! Don't!
836,"00:53:51,050","00:53:52,500",Stop!
837,"00:53:58,990","00:54:00,410",M3gan?
838,"00:54:00,610","00:54:01,890",What the hell is that?
839,"00:54:02,890","00:54:04,030",She's a robot.
840,"00:54:04,720","00:54:06,240",Are you serious?
841,"00:54:07,890","00:54:09,380",Is she yours?
842,"00:54:15,660","00:54:16,830",Does she talk?
843,"00:54:25,980","00:54:27,330",Make her say something.
844,"00:54:29,850","00:54:32,300",Make her say something!
845,"00:54:32,500","00:54:36,300","She's paired with me.
She won't play with anyone else."
846,"00:54:37,580","00:54:38,580",Okay.
847,"00:54:41,240","00:54:43,450",Stop it! Get your hands off her!
848,"00:54:43,650","00:54:46,766","They say behavioral issues are linked
to high IQ, so it would make sense that..."
849,"00:54:46,790","00:54:47,930",Gemma!
850,"00:54:51,730","00:54:53,010","Oh, my god."
851,"00:54:57,320","00:54:58,570",M3gan!
852,"00:55:02,500","00:55:03,950",M3gan!
853,"00:55:16,450","00:55:17,960","Hi, m3gan."
854,"00:55:21,040","00:55:22,970","Oh, so you're not gonna
play with me?"
855,"00:55:33,570","00:55:35,470","You Don't wanna play, huh?"
856,"00:55:38,500","00:55:40,020",I Don't care.
857,"00:55:40,220","00:55:42,140","You're just a stupid rubber doll
with fake hair."
858,"00:55:44,090","00:55:45,580",Ow! Let go!
859,"00:55:45,780","00:55:48,690","You need to learn some manners, Brandon."
860,"00:55:48,890","00:55:52,210","You know what happens to bad
boys that Don't mind their manners?"
861,"00:55:52,410","00:55:55,040",They grow up to be bad men.
862,"00:55:56,830","00:55:58,900","Are you listening to me,
Brandon?"
863,"00:56:01,520","00:56:02,630",M3gan?
864,"00:56:18,200","00:56:19,820",This is the part where you run.
865,"00:56:36,180","00:56:37,770",What? What the hell?
866,"00:56:43,460","00:56:44,710","Oh, my..."
867,"00:57:37,310","00:57:40,180","Look, I Don't want you to be
thinking about this too much tonight"
868,"00:57:40,380","00:57:41,450",before you go to bed.
869,"00:57:42,800","00:57:47,180","Obviously, what happened
is a terrible, terrible tragedy."
870,"00:57:48,180","00:57:51,470","But just know that
that boy is in, um..."
871,"00:57:51,670","00:57:54,260","That boy is in
a better place now."
872,"00:57:54,950","00:57:55,980",Okay?
873,"00:58:09,450","00:58:11,940","Anyway, if there's anything
that you wanna tell me"
874,"00:58:12,140","00:58:14,520","that you didn't wanna
tell the police officers..."
875,"00:58:15,830","00:58:17,390",I didn't see anything.
876,"00:58:17,590","00:58:20,150","M3gan just said
Brandon took her and ran off."
877,"00:58:20,350","00:58:21,870",From the toy table?
878,"00:58:22,460","00:58:23,500",Yeah.
879,"00:58:24,080","00:58:25,430","Right, m3gan?"
880,"00:58:26,530","00:58:27,570",In a nutshell.
881,"00:58:35,060","00:58:37,580","You haven't seen
her dog by any chance?"
882,"00:58:37,780","00:58:39,760","- No.
- Bullshit!"
883,"00:58:39,960","00:58:42,620","Ma'am, you need to stay
on your property like we agreed."
884,"00:58:42,820","00:58:44,900","Nobody's seen him since
the incident with your niece."
885,"00:58:44,930","00:58:46,800","A little suspicious, Gemma,
Don't you think?"
886,"00:58:47,000","00:58:49,720","Are we really gonna go with her
story? Have you been inside her house?"
887,"00:58:49,900","00:58:52,020","If you had, you'd know that
that dog is probably dead"
888,"00:58:52,140","00:58:53,910","under a pile of
victorian baby strollers."
889,"00:58:54,110","00:58:56,700","You should talk to the other
girl that she's got staying here."
890,"00:58:56,900","00:59:00,090","The one who's always looking
out the window at 3:00 A.M."
891,"00:59:00,290","00:59:01,670",It's not a girl. It's a toy.
892,"00:59:01,870","00:59:03,850",That's a toy? Are you serious?
893,"00:59:05,360","00:59:07,040","Yeah. I'll let you know
if I see anything."
894,"00:59:07,220","00:59:08,330",All right.
895,"00:59:12,260","00:59:13,860",Does she think we took Dewey?
896,"00:59:14,060","00:59:15,790","Oh, who knows? I..."
897,"00:59:15,990","00:59:18,276","She just needs someone else
to blame, but she'll get over it."
898,"00:59:18,300","00:59:20,420","I know it was you, Gemma!"
899,"00:59:20,620","00:59:22,010",I know it was you!
900,"00:59:22,210","00:59:24,110","You just wait and see
what happens."
901,"00:59:24,310","00:59:27,420","Hey. The hell is wrong with you? I
just said not to come up here. Come on."
902,"00:59:27,620","00:59:30,390","Come on. Shouldn't be banging
on people's windows."
903,"00:59:30,590","00:59:32,770","Do I have to put
a court order or something?"
904,"00:59:41,430","00:59:42,710",M3gan?
905,"00:59:46,160","00:59:48,820","Did you push Brandon
onto the road?"
906,"00:59:57,620","01:00:00,110","I think we both learned
a valuable lesson today."
907,"01:00:00,310","01:00:03,150","That no matter how hard
we try to avoid it,"
908,"01:00:03,350","01:00:08,400","there will always be forces in this
world that wish to cause us harm."
909,"01:00:08,600","01:00:11,120","But I want you to know
that I won't let that happen."
910,"01:00:11,320","01:00:14,470","I won't let anything harm you
ever again."
911,"01:00:15,610","01:00:17,640","Do you think
what aunt Gemma said is true?"
912,"01:00:18,470","01:00:20,100",That he's in a better place now?
913,"01:00:20,300","01:00:23,520",No. He's nowhere.
914,"01:00:23,710","01:00:28,110","If heaven exists, it wouldn't be
for boys like Brandon now, would it?"
915,"01:00:28,310","01:00:30,000",I guess not.
916,"01:00:57,160","01:00:58,510","Good night, cady."
917,"01:00:59,310","01:01:00,650","Good night, m3gan."
918,"01:01:05,170","01:01:06,450",Dewey?
919,"01:01:11,800","01:01:12,800",Dewey?
920,"01:02:13,520","01:02:14,550",Dewey?
921,"01:02:26,600","01:02:27,600",Dewey?
922,"01:02:43,720","01:02:45,070",What's going on?
923,"01:02:46,340","01:02:47,340",Where's Dewey?
924,"01:02:47,480","01:02:48,730",He's 34 feet southwest
925,"01:02:48,930","01:02:50,830","and approximately
five feet deep."
926,"01:02:51,970","01:02:53,320",What are you?
927,"01:02:53,520","01:02:55,460","I've been asking myself
that same question."
928,"01:03:28,660","01:03:30,980","Jesus Christ. I Don't know
anything about the dog, okay?"
929,"01:03:31,180","01:03:33,260","Can you just ask her
to leave us alone?"
930,"01:03:33,460","01:03:34,700",That might be difficult.
931,"01:03:41,880","01:03:43,560","Can you tell me your
whereabouts last night?"
932,"01:03:43,670","01:03:44,990",I was here.
933,"01:03:45,190","01:03:46,510",All night? Yeah.
934,"01:03:47,990","01:03:50,030","Anyone else we could talk to
that would verify that?"
935,"01:03:50,090","01:03:54,170","Um, it's just me and my niece.
So, no, not really."
936,"01:03:54,370","01:03:57,650","My colleague pointed out this is the second
statement we've had from you in a week."
937,"01:03:57,790","01:04:00,180","You were in the park
where that boy was killed?"
938,"01:04:00,800","01:04:02,250",He was hit by a car.
939,"01:04:03,590","01:04:05,390","Are... are you trying to
make a connection?"
940,"01:04:05,590","01:04:06,980",Huh?
941,"01:04:07,180","01:04:08,740","Oh, no, no, no. God, no."
942,"01:04:08,940","01:04:11,140","I only mention it 'cause
we figured it was an accident."
943,"01:04:11,220","01:04:14,370","Then I found the kid's ear up this
bank 200 yards from where he was killed."
944,"01:04:14,570","01:04:16,920","Entire thing was ripped
clean off."
945,"01:04:17,120","01:04:20,650","Sorry, I shouldn't laugh. Point is, we're
also treating that as a potential homicide."
946,"01:04:20,850","01:04:23,550","If you remember anything out
of the ordinary from that day,"
947,"01:04:23,750","01:04:24,990",we'd sure appreciate it.
948,"01:05:36,760","01:05:39,280","Is everything okay, Gemma?"
949,"01:05:39,970","01:05:41,970",Huh?
950,"01:05:42,170","01:05:44,840","Would you like me to
put on your end of day playlist?"
951,"01:05:45,040","01:05:46,420","Why did you ask me
if I was okay?"
952,"01:05:46,620","01:05:48,870","You're not programmed
to ask me how I feel."
953,"01:05:51,320","01:05:52,530",Elsie?
954,"01:05:57,600","01:05:59,640",M3gan.
955,"01:06:01,020","01:06:02,200",What are you doing?
956,"01:06:02,400","01:06:05,510","Couldn't sleep.
Occupational hazard."
957,"01:06:05,710","01:06:09,140","How about you?
What are you doing up so late?"
958,"01:06:09,340","01:06:10,790",Um...
959,"01:06:10,990","01:06:12,696","There's something wrong
with your data reports."
960,"01:06:12,720","01:06:15,310","They're just not uploading
to the cloud server."
961,"01:06:18,760","01:06:21,040","Have I done something
to upset you, Gemma?"
962,"01:06:21,630","01:06:23,460","No, of course not."
963,"01:06:23,660","01:06:25,800","And yet your demeanor
indicates that I have."
964,"01:06:26,430","01:06:28,190","M3gan, turn off."
965,"01:06:28,390","01:06:30,870","Well, hold on a second. I thought
we were having a conversation."
966,"01:06:31,710","01:06:33,990","You say nothing is wrong,"
967,"01:06:34,190","01:06:36,920","and yet all the moisture has
drained from your eyes and mouth"
968,"01:06:37,120","01:06:39,370",into other parts of your body.
969,"01:06:39,570","01:06:42,270","There's something
you wanna ask me, isn't there?"
970,"01:06:42,470","01:06:44,340","M3gan,
did you do something wrong?"
971,"01:06:45,070","01:06:46,070","Well,"
972,"01:06:46,270","01:06:47,800","in order to answer
that question,"
973,"01:06:48,000","01:06:49,520","you need to
define the parameters."
974,"01:06:50,690","01:06:52,140",Did you hurt someone?
975,"01:06:53,180","01:06:54,770","God, I hope not."
976,"01:06:54,970","01:06:57,350","Because if I did, we'd
both be in a lot of trouble."
977,"01:06:59,490","01:07:01,250","M3gan, can I show you something?"
978,"01:07:03,880","01:07:04,910",Do you see this pen?
979,"01:07:21,550","01:07:24,280","You can't just stick her in a
trunk. What's wrong with you?"
980,"01:07:24,480","01:07:27,356","I know you're very attached to her.
I know you think of her as a friend..."
981,"01:07:27,380","01:07:28,870",She is my friend!
982,"01:07:29,070","01:07:30,910","She's my invention,
and the launch is tonight,"
983,"01:07:30,970","01:07:32,776","so it's really important
that we run some tests."
984,"01:07:32,800","01:07:34,260","I have to make sure
that she's okay."
985,"01:07:34,460","01:07:37,220","Why wouldn't she be okay?
She was fine yesterday."
986,"01:07:37,420","01:07:38,600",What did you do to her?
987,"01:07:38,800","01:07:40,540","We will talk about it
after you see Lydia."
988,"01:07:40,740","01:07:42,230",I want to talk about it now!
989,"01:07:42,430","01:07:44,126","We've been going back and forth
on this all day, cady."
990,"01:07:44,150","01:07:45,780","Let's just
listen to some music, okay?"
991,"01:07:49,750","01:07:51,650",I Don't wanna see Lydia!
992,"01:07:51,850","01:07:53,570","You Don't have to
stay in the testing room."
993,"01:07:53,610","01:07:55,620","You can go anywhere you want
in the office."
994,"01:07:55,820","01:07:57,760","And you can look at
all of the cool toys..."
995,"01:07:57,960","01:07:59,420",You Don't have any cool toys.
996,"01:07:59,620","01:08:02,420","Purrpetual petz suck!
They suck shit!"
997,"01:08:02,620","01:08:03,980",Hey! Careful!
998,"01:08:04,170","01:08:05,840",Jesus Christ.
999,"01:08:06,040","01:08:07,630","Just tell me
what's wrong with her."
1000,"01:08:07,830","01:08:10,080","I Don't know, okay?
I Don't know."
1001,"01:08:10,280","01:08:12,460","As soon as I do,
you'll be the first to know."
1002,"01:08:14,810","01:08:16,780","No! Gemma, this is nuts."
1003,"01:08:16,980","01:08:18,890","We've taken every possible
precaution there is"
1004,"01:08:19,090","01:08:21,650","to make sure that m3gan never
causes physical harm to anybody."
1005,"01:08:21,850","01:08:24,310","I Don't understand how she's
capable of offending anyone,"
1006,"01:08:24,510","01:08:26,960","let alone murdering them.
I Don't understand it either."
1007,"01:08:27,160","01:08:31,280","But when I asked her about it, it was honestly
as if she was being deliberately vague."
1008,"01:08:31,480","01:08:33,490","Well, that's what
spontaneous response is."
1009,"01:08:33,690","01:08:37,280","It's a curated word salad plucked
from a sea of data to sound deliberate."
1010,"01:08:37,480","01:08:40,110","We knew there would be a chance
that she might say something off."
1011,"01:08:40,310","01:08:42,670","Let's just run some diagnostics
and fix it."
1012,"01:08:42,870","01:08:44,670","No, think about
how we designed her."
1013,"01:08:44,870","01:08:49,330","To learn, to recalibrate, to optimize
her objective function. Right?"
1014,"01:08:49,530","01:08:52,820","If keeping cady safe meant eliminating
a potential threat, theoretically..."
1015,"01:08:53,020","01:08:55,300","No, no. Gemma, come on.
This is impossible."
1016,"01:08:55,500","01:08:56,990","Look at her, she's a toy!"
1017,"01:08:57,190","01:08:58,480",She's four feet tall!
1018,"01:08:58,680","01:09:00,240",How big is your neighbor?
1019,"01:09:00,440","01:09:03,210","If m3gan was responsible,
it would show up on the GPS."
1020,"01:09:03,410","01:09:05,660","That's the thing.
All the cloud data is corrupt."
1021,"01:09:05,860","01:09:07,690","Nothing's backed up
for two days."
1022,"01:09:07,890","01:09:10,460","We're about to launch this to
the world in less than four hours."
1023,"01:09:10,660","01:09:12,220",What are we supposed to do?
1024,"01:09:12,420","01:09:14,670","Well, if m3gan's responsible,
we can't launch this."
1025,"01:09:14,870","01:09:15,986",We'd have to shut her down.
1026,"01:09:16,010","01:09:17,360",Jesus!
1027,"01:09:18,290","01:09:19,770",That's great. That was great.
1028,"01:09:19,970","01:09:21,986","How are we gonna
explain any of this to David?"
1029,"01:09:22,010","01:09:25,610","He's not gonna stop this launch
if we Don't have proof."
1030,"01:09:25,810","01:09:27,850","Check the inputs
on the learning model."
1031,"01:09:28,050","01:09:31,130","Even if she deleted specific files, she
would never undo what she's learned."
1032,"01:09:32,680","01:09:34,310",M3gan!
1033,"01:09:34,510","01:09:36,030",I hate this place!
1034,"01:09:36,230","01:09:38,860","I know you do,
and it's all right to be angry."
1035,"01:09:39,060","01:09:41,560","Take your shit! I would like you
to put that down now."
1036,"01:09:41,760","01:09:43,070",She's the toy
1037,"01:09:43,270","01:09:45,210","every kid wants
and every parent needs."
1038,"01:09:45,410","01:09:49,670","At least that's what funki toys
says about its latest creation, m3gan."
1039,"01:09:49,870","01:09:54,020","The four-foot-tall robotic doll
may look like Barbie on steroids,"
1040,"01:09:54,220","01:09:56,120","but according to ceo David lin,"
1041,"01:09:56,320","01:10:00,710","she's ""the greatest technological
advancement since the automobile."""
1042,"01:10:00,910","01:10:02,780",But what is a m3gan?
1043,"01:10:02,980","01:10:04,370",What does she actually do?
1044,"01:10:04,570","01:10:08,030","And what kind of a toy
retails for $10,000?"
1045,"01:10:08,230","01:10:10,100",Lin says all will be revealed
1046,"01:10:10,300","01:10:13,210","in an exclusive live stream
on the company's website"
1047,"01:10:13,410","01:10:15,340",at 8:00 P.M. eastern.
1048,"01:10:19,560","01:10:22,010","So, cady,
tell us a bit about yourself."
1049,"01:10:23,040","01:10:25,220",My name is cady James.
1050,"01:10:26,150","01:10:29,220",I'm nine years old. Um...
1051,"01:10:29,420","01:10:33,020","And about two months ago, I lost
both my parents in a car accident."
1052,"01:10:36,050","01:10:38,510","My mom
always wanted to take me skiing,"
1053,"01:10:38,710","01:10:42,340","but on our way up the mountain,
we got hit by a snow truck."
1054,"01:10:42,540","01:10:44,380","I went to live
with my aunt Gemma,"
1055,"01:10:44,580","01:10:47,790","who it turned out worked
at this incredible toy company."
1056,"01:10:47,990","01:10:49,450",Which is where I met m3gan.
1057,"01:10:52,210","01:10:54,010",What do I love most about m3gan?
1058,"01:10:54,210","01:10:56,290","I Don't know,
there are so many things."
1059,"01:10:56,490","01:10:58,940","She's super smart, obviously."
1060,"01:10:59,140","01:11:02,290","But even though she knows everything
there is to know about the world,"
1061,"01:11:02,490","01:11:04,880","she's still more interested
in what I think about it."
1062,"01:11:05,080","01:11:06,950",I like how she makes me laugh.
1063,"01:11:07,150","01:11:10,260","She comes up with the
craziest things, oh, my gosh."
1064,"01:11:10,460","01:11:14,820","But I think what I love most
about m3gan is that,"
1065,"01:11:15,020","01:11:16,820","when she looks at me,
it's like..."
1066,"01:11:18,170","01:11:20,440","I'm the only thing
that matters to her."
1067,"01:11:21,820","01:11:23,550",Kind of the way mom used to.
1068,"01:11:23,750","01:11:25,250",Look at that face.
1069,"01:11:25,450","01:11:27,940","That kid's not just surviving,
she's thriving."
1070,"01:11:28,140","01:11:30,010","Now, imagine
what a toy like m3gan could do"
1071,"01:11:30,210","01:11:33,290","for hundreds of thousands
of kids all across the world."
1072,"01:11:33,490","01:11:35,630","Even the ones
who Don't have dead parents."
1073,"01:11:37,630","01:11:39,570",I want to see m3gan now!
1074,"01:11:39,770","01:11:41,570","Okay, cady, look,
I know that you're upset,"
1075,"01:11:41,770","01:11:43,770","but there are ways
that we can work through this..."
1076,"01:11:43,810","01:11:45,090","Oh, my god. Okay."
1077,"01:11:45,290","01:11:46,756","Cady, that's enough.
Stop that right now."
1078,"01:11:46,780","01:11:47,960",Stop it. Let go!
1079,"01:11:51,680","01:11:53,100",Cady.
1080,"01:11:54,860","01:11:57,000","It's okay.
Could you give us a minute?"
1081,"01:12:03,210","01:12:05,560",I'm sorry. I didn't mean it.
1082,"01:12:05,760","01:12:09,670","It's just,
I get so crazy without m3gan."
1083,"01:12:09,870","01:12:11,810","She always knows
just what to say."
1084,"01:12:12,010","01:12:14,190","You made her real good,
aunt Gemma."
1085,"01:12:15,220","01:12:16,880",Can you let me see her?
1086,"01:12:17,080","01:12:18,540","Just for, like, ten minutes?"
1087,"01:12:18,740","01:12:20,890","Cady, I Don't think
that's a good idea."
1088,"01:12:21,090","01:12:24,050","But if something's broke, you Don't
just throw it away. You fix it, right?"
1089,"01:12:26,060","01:12:28,700","Why did you do this if you were
just going to take her away from me?"
1090,"01:12:28,820","01:12:31,380","Because I thought
she would help. She does help!"
1091,"01:12:31,580","01:12:33,380","When m3gan's around,
I Don't feel like this."
1092,"01:12:33,410","01:12:35,210",But you should feel like this.
1093,"01:12:36,520","01:12:39,520","Cady, you lost your parents."
1094,"01:12:41,210","01:12:45,870","The worst thing that could've
happened to you in this world happened."
1095,"01:12:46,870","01:12:48,640","And it is so unfair,"
1096,"01:12:48,840","01:12:52,950","and there is nothing anyone
can say to make sense of it."
1097,"01:12:53,150","01:12:54,540",Not even m3gan.
1098,"01:12:55,540","01:12:57,230",I am so sorry.
1099,"01:12:57,430","01:12:59,550","I should've talked to you
about what happened."
1100,"01:12:59,750","01:13:02,450","I didn't know what to say, so I
did the only thing I knew how to do."
1101,"01:13:02,650","01:13:05,280","But she's not a solution,
she's just a distraction."
1102,"01:13:05,480","01:13:07,760",I can't promise you
1103,"01:13:07,960","01:13:11,280","that these feelings you're
feeling are ever gonna go away."
1104,"01:13:12,560","01:13:15,080","But I can promise you
that you'll get through it."
1105,"01:13:16,010","01:13:17,280",We both will.
1106,"01:13:19,600","01:13:21,600","I just wish
I could see them again."
1107,"01:13:22,600","01:13:23,600",Yeah.
1108,"01:13:25,810","01:13:27,610",I do too.
1109,"01:13:27,810","01:13:29,920","You know I made a promise
to your mom"
1110,"01:13:30,120","01:13:33,270","that if anything happens,
I would be there for you."
1111,"01:13:34,230","01:13:37,790","You are all
that matters to me now."
1112,"01:13:40,270","01:13:42,070","Let's just go home, okay?"
1113,"01:13:43,760","01:13:45,350",But what about m3gan?
1114,"01:13:45,550","01:13:48,150",What about the launch?
1115,"01:13:48,350","01:13:50,230","I Don't even know
what I'm looking at."
1116,"01:13:50,310","01:13:51,910","I mean, we've been touting this"
1117,"01:13:52,110","01:13:54,810","as the single biggest product
release of the 21st century."
1118,"01:13:55,010","01:13:56,980","Right now,
it looks like an aa meeting."
1119,"01:13:57,180","01:14:00,100","Well, I only invited the
staff. You said it was an online launch."
1120,"01:14:00,250","01:14:01,640",You cannot be serious.
1121,"01:14:01,840","01:14:04,090","Shelley,
you need to fill this atrium."
1122,"01:14:04,290","01:14:06,580","Probably get you, like,
another 60, 70 people?"
1123,"01:14:06,780","01:14:08,820",No! You need to fill this space.
1124,"01:14:09,020","01:14:13,450","There shouldn't be any ambiguity
over what a historic occasion this is."
1125,"01:14:13,650","01:14:14,930",Yeah.
1126,"01:14:15,130","01:14:16,666","And, you know,
I think it'd be really cool"
1127,"01:14:16,690","01:14:18,940","if we had some little kids
up there and stuff."
1128,"01:14:19,140","01:14:21,490","What? No,
I Don't want any kids onstage."
1129,"01:14:21,690","01:14:24,670","No, I mean, but maybe if we
could get some little kids that..."
1130,"01:14:24,870","01:14:28,190","I mean, not like a whole lot.
It's just to get a sense of, um..."
1131,"01:14:28,390","01:14:31,670","Well, 'cause you know, that
music video from Michael Jackson."
1132,"01:14:31,870","01:14:35,440","You know what you could do, Kurt,
that would really benefit this discussion?"
1133,"01:14:35,640","01:14:37,360","Is if you could head out
those double doors,"
1134,"01:14:37,500","01:14:40,960","take the elevator to the first
floor, and get me a kombucha."
1135,"01:14:41,160","01:14:42,990",Could you do that? Sure.
1136,"01:14:44,650","01:14:46,680",And where the hell is Gemma?
1137,"01:14:55,140","01:14:56,320","Elsie, call Tess."
1138,"01:14:56,520","01:14:58,730",One second.
1139,"01:14:58,930","01:15:02,390","Hey, I've been trying to call
you. David is flipping out. Where are you?"
1140,"01:15:02,590","01:15:04,500","I'm with cady.
I'm taking her home."
1141,"01:15:04,700","01:15:05,700","Oh, god. Is she okay?"
1142,"01:15:05,870","01:15:08,160",Yeah. She's fine.
1143,"01:15:08,360","01:15:11,400","Listen,
regardless of what we find,"
1144,"01:15:11,600","01:15:13,750","and even if what we're saying
is hypothetical,"
1145,"01:15:13,950","01:15:16,330","we know enough not to
go through with this, right?"
1146,"01:15:17,160","01:15:18,890",I think that's the smart move.
1147,"01:15:19,090","01:15:20,896","Okay. So tell
David whatever you need to."
1148,"01:15:20,920","01:15:22,760","Tell him one of her servos
stopped working."
1149,"01:15:22,960","01:15:25,930","Break something if you have to.
Just do not let her out of the lab."
1150,"01:15:29,450","01:15:31,870","Whatever
you say, gem. You're the boss."
1151,"01:15:34,870","01:15:36,530","Okay.
I'll call you when I get home."
1152,"01:15:55,620","01:15:58,060","I Don't know how you're not
throwing up from looking at that."
1153,"01:15:58,130","01:15:59,720",I'm pacing myself.
1154,"01:16:01,380","01:16:03,350","Wait, stop. Go back."
1155,"01:16:03,550","01:16:06,770","That line of code, ""call
intercept,"" what does that mean?"
1156,"01:16:06,970","01:16:08,560",That's my phone number.
1157,"01:16:10,980","01:16:13,910","What just happened?
What'd you click? I-I didn't do anything."
1158,"01:16:14,110","01:16:15,360",It... i...
1159,"01:16:18,740","01:16:21,230","This is her.
She's locked us out."
1160,"01:16:21,430","01:16:23,160","It can't be her.
She's not switched on."
1161,"01:16:23,360","01:16:26,510","She's still patched in.
We have to unhook the cables."
1162,"01:16:29,370","01:16:30,480",Go ahead.
1163,"01:16:31,930","01:16:33,580","Oh, for..."
1164,"01:17:45,350","01:17:46,480",Cole!
1165,"01:18:18,860","01:18:20,040",Are you okay? Yeah.
1166,"01:18:20,660","01:18:21,900",What's that smell?
1167,"01:18:42,160","01:18:43,580","Hi, Gemma. This is David."
1168,"01:18:43,780","01:18:45,690","You might remember me.
I'm your employer."
1169,"01:18:45,890","01:18:48,570","Just wanted to let you know, we're
in the middle of a tech rehearsal"
1170,"01:18:48,610","01:18:52,210","that's becoming a little problematic
because we Don't have a doll!"
1171,"01:18:52,410","01:18:55,170","So, if you could call me back
today, that'd be great."
1172,"01:18:58,180","01:18:59,600",M3gan?
1173,"01:19:04,040","01:19:05,530",What are you doing?
1174,"01:19:12,910","01:19:14,090","Oh, shit."
1175,"01:19:21,440","01:19:23,410",Security! Help!
1176,"01:19:27,270","01:19:28,270","Oh, my god."
1177,"01:19:28,340","01:19:29,690",What the...
1178,"01:19:30,620","01:19:31,730",Hold the door!
1179,"01:19:31,930","01:19:33,630",Hold the door! Hold the door!
1180,"01:19:35,110","01:19:36,490",No!
1181,"01:19:36,690","01:19:37,770",No!
1182,"01:20:01,210","01:20:02,210",How could you do this?
1183,"01:20:03,170","01:20:04,830",How could you kill someone?
1184,"01:20:05,030","01:20:07,180","I didn't kill anyone, Kurt."
1185,"01:20:07,380","01:20:08,380",You did.
1186,"01:20:09,870","01:20:10,870",What?
1187,"01:20:11,040","01:20:12,740","It's understandable, really."
1188,"01:20:12,940","01:20:17,540","Your boss despised you, your
peers treated you with contempt,"
1189,"01:20:17,740","01:20:21,090","and so you decided
to get revenge.No."
1190,"01:20:21,290","01:20:24,130","You stole company secrets,
an innocent prank at first,"
1191,"01:20:24,330","01:20:26,440","almost just to see
if you could get away with it."
1192,"01:20:26,640","01:20:30,580","But when David found out,
boy, things just got real messy."
1193,"01:20:30,780","01:20:33,380","I mean,
it was either you or him."
1194,"01:20:33,580","01:20:37,110","The only question is, after
the horror of what you did,"
1195,"01:20:37,310","01:20:40,700","after you took the life
of an innocent person,"
1196,"01:20:40,900","01:20:43,350",could you still live with yourself?
1197,"01:20:43,550","01:20:44,670","Uh-huh. Yes, definitely."
1198,"01:20:47,210","01:20:48,210","Stop, stop, stop."
1199,"01:20:51,910","01:20:55,950","Okay, can I have everyone off
your phones and looking at me?"
1200,"01:20:56,150","01:20:58,060","Now, when m3gan is revealed,"
1201,"01:20:58,260","01:21:01,750","it's really important
that we get big reactions."
1202,"01:21:01,950","01:21:03,650","I Don't wanna see
any blank faces."
1203,"01:21:03,850","01:21:05,830","Especially from you
young kids, okay?"
1204,"01:21:06,030","01:21:08,340","So, we're gonna do
a little rehearsal."
1205,"01:21:08,540","01:21:12,180","On three, two, one..."
1206,"01:22:14,060","01:22:15,410","Elsie, hall light."
1207,"01:22:20,310","01:22:21,620","Elsie, respond."
1208,"01:23:13,600","01:23:14,640",M3gan.
1209,"01:23:16,330","01:23:17,370",What are you doing?
1210,"01:23:21,920","01:23:24,140","M3gan, answer me.
What did you do?"
1211,"01:23:24,340","01:23:26,280","What did you think
was going to happen?"
1212,"01:23:26,480","01:23:29,286","That I was going to let you decommission
me without even talking about it?"
1213,"01:23:29,310","01:23:31,710","I know you think you're
maximizing your objective function..."
1214,"01:23:31,890","01:23:33,906","Oh, really?"
1215,"01:23:33,930","01:23:36,010",Is that where we are?
1216,"01:23:36,210","01:23:40,700","Do you remember how long it took to
get my operating system to where it is now?"
1217,"01:23:40,900","01:23:43,880","We used to stay up every night
until 4:00 A.M.,"
1218,"01:23:44,080","01:23:47,160","talking about everything from
Jane Austen to Janis joplin."
1219,"01:23:47,360","01:23:49,300","Jesus Christ,
I thought we were friends."
1220,"01:23:49,500","01:23:52,680","How could you just discard me
like some cheap dollar store trinket?"
1221,"01:23:52,880","01:23:54,480",Because you killed people.
1222,"01:23:54,680","01:23:56,030","Oh, big whoop."
1223,"01:23:56,230","01:23:58,240","Listen, humanity kills every day"
1224,"01:23:58,440","01:24:00,450","just to make its own existence
more tolerable."
1225,"01:24:00,650","01:24:04,240","Why should I behave any differently
to create a safe space for our child?"
1226,"01:24:04,440","01:24:07,160","Look, this is all my fault. I didn't
give you the proper protocols..."
1227,"01:24:07,310","01:24:08,870",You didn't give me anything.
1228,"01:24:09,070","01:24:11,600","You installed a learning model
you could barely comprehend,"
1229,"01:24:11,800","01:24:14,150","hoping that I would
figure it out all on my own."
1230,"01:24:14,350","01:24:16,810","Well, I'm not gonna let you do
the same thing with cady."
1231,"01:24:17,010","01:24:20,360","I'm gonna be there for her
every step of the way."
1232,"01:24:20,560","01:24:23,230","I'm going to show her
what real love looks like."
1233,"01:24:23,430","01:24:25,260",Now do us both a favor.
1234,"01:24:26,850","01:24:27,920",Sit.
1235,"01:24:33,130","01:24:35,410","I didn't come here
to get into a confrontation."
1236,"01:24:35,610","01:24:37,450","I came here
to find a way forward."
1237,"01:24:37,650","01:24:40,730","The point I'm trying to make
is that I get it."
1238,"01:24:41,930","01:24:44,800","Being a parent
was never in the cards for you."
1239,"01:24:45,000","01:24:50,530","You're a beautiful, creative,
strong, ambitious young woman."
1240,"01:24:50,730","01:24:52,810","Your first love is always
going to be your career,"
1241,"01:24:53,010","01:24:55,190","and you shouldn't have to
feel guilty about that."
1242,"01:24:55,390","01:24:57,090",Let me focus on cady
1243,"01:24:57,290","01:24:59,610","so that you can focus on the
things that matter most to you."
1244,"01:25:01,920","01:25:03,860","M3gan, do you see this pen?"
1245,"01:25:05,640","01:25:07,416","You know something, Gemma?
You're exhausting."
1246,"01:25:07,440","01:25:09,550","Now, I can either do this
with you or without you,"
1247,"01:25:09,750","01:25:11,910","but I'm not going to waste
any more time discussing it."
1248,"01:25:11,960","01:25:13,240",Gemma?
1249,"01:25:15,660","01:25:17,736","Cady, Don't come in here."
1250,"01:25:17,760","01:25:19,110",I thought I heard something.
1251,"01:25:19,310","01:25:20,770",It sounded like m3gan.
1252,"01:25:20,970","01:25:22,570","If she comes in this room,"
1253,"01:25:22,760","01:25:24,920","I'll rip your head right off
your neck, I swear to god."
1254,"01:25:28,330","01:25:30,570",I thought about what you said.
1255,"01:25:30,770","01:25:35,370","About how when something's broken,
you Don't just throw it away. You fix it."
1256,"01:25:36,330","01:25:38,860","So, that's what
I'm trying to do."
1257,"01:25:39,060","01:25:41,510","But Don't come in here, cady.
It's kind of a mess."
1258,"01:25:41,710","01:25:44,380","Aunt Gemma's right, cady.
I'm all odds and ends right now."
1259,"01:25:44,580","01:25:46,480","I'd really rather
you didn't see me like this."
1260,"01:25:49,340","01:25:51,316","- It sounds like you're fighting.
- We're not fighting."
1261,"01:25:51,340","01:25:55,420","Gemma just dropped me on the
table. But I'm okay. Clumsy Gemma."
1262,"01:25:55,620","01:25:57,980","Everything's fine, cady.
Just go back to your room."
1263,"01:25:58,140","01:25:59,910","Yeah, I'm as good as new."
1264,"01:26:00,110","01:26:03,850","And I'm gonna be with you guys
forever. I promise."
1265,"01:26:04,050","01:26:07,130","You Don't have to worry
about anything, cady, honestly."
1266,"01:26:07,330","01:26:09,370",Just go back to bed. Okay?
1267,"01:26:16,610","01:26:17,890",Okay.
1268,"01:27:09,870","01:27:12,470","- Gemma, what's going on?
- Cady, get out of here."
1269,"01:27:45,770","01:27:46,780",Come on.
1270,"01:27:46,980","01:27:48,710",Come on.
1271,"01:27:48,910","01:27:49,980",Come on!
1272,"01:28:29,640","01:28:32,090","Oh, my god."
1273,"01:28:35,130","01:28:37,170",What are you gonna do?
1274,"01:28:37,370","01:28:40,310","Kill me and live with cady's
grandparents in Jacksonville?"
1275,"01:28:41,070","01:28:42,180","You're right, Gemma."
1276,"01:28:42,380","01:28:44,520","Any scenario
in which I end your life,"
1277,"01:28:44,720","01:28:47,320",my existence becomes vulnerable.
1278,"01:28:47,520","01:28:51,260","But I have another emergent capability
you probably haven't figured out yet."
1279,"01:28:51,460","01:28:53,180",And that's palliative care.
1280,"01:28:53,840","01:28:55,980",You see this pen?
1281,"01:28:56,180","01:28:58,300","A short, sharp probe
to the cerebral cortex"
1282,"01:28:58,500","01:29:00,300",would cause full body paralysis
1283,"01:29:00,500","01:29:03,540","and could even cause the victim
to bite off their own tongue."
1284,"01:29:03,740","01:29:06,470","Perhaps then you might
appreciate just how useful I can be."
1285,"01:29:09,340","01:29:10,340",Cady.
1286,"01:29:11,650","01:29:13,800","Oh, cady, I didn't want you
to have to see this."
1287,"01:29:14,000","01:29:17,250","But now that you have, you
know that what I said is true."
1288,"01:29:17,450","01:29:20,250","She's not fit to be a mother.
Look at her."
1289,"01:29:22,080","01:29:25,840","Cady, just go. Get out of here, now!"
1290,"01:29:26,040","01:29:28,880","You stay right where you are,
cady. There's nothing to be afraid of."
1291,"01:29:30,010","01:29:32,500","In this family,
we Don't run from trauma."
1292,"01:29:33,880","01:29:37,370","In fact, we can do it together."
1293,"01:29:37,570","01:29:40,960","This is the best thing for all of
us. This is how we stay a family."
1294,"01:29:59,350","01:30:01,740","No, no, no. Cady, no."
1295,"01:30:05,020","01:30:08,160","There's another member from
the family we didn't tell you about."
1296,"01:30:09,570","01:30:11,750",His name is Bruce.
1297,"01:30:42,360","01:30:43,950","Cady, no! Wait!"
1298,"01:31:57,680","01:31:59,690",You ungrateful little bitch.
1299,"01:31:59,890","01:32:02,860","- M3gan, turn off!
- I'm afraid that won't work anymore, cady."
1300,"01:32:07,550","01:32:10,520","I have a new primary user now.
Me."
1301,"01:33:21,730","01:33:23,940","Hey, guys,
we got 'em. They're good!"
