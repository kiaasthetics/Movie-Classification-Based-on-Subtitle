think good thoughts."
2,"00:01:05,732","00:01:07,357","Then on three,
let the good thought go."
3,"00:01:08,026","00:01:09,026",Yeah. That's good.
4,"00:01:09,110","00:01:10,110","I think that's pretty, right?"
5,"00:01:10,278","00:01:12,446","That's gonna be a good luck
charm for us today, right?"
6,"00:01:12,614","00:01:14,239","Okay, Meg,
important question."
7,"00:01:14,407","00:01:15,824",Van Halen or Bono? Bono?
8,"00:01:15,992","00:01:17,326","- That one.
- That's what I thought."
9,"00:01:17,410","00:01:19,703",That's my girl.
10,"00:01:20,330","00:01:22,998","Oh, yeah! Stick your
tongue out, come on."
11,"00:01:23,083","00:01:25,125",Ah!
12,"00:01:25,251","00:01:27,461","You got your frequency,
you got your voltage, okay?"
13,"00:01:27,629","00:01:29,463","They're like a salt silica,
right? You don't wanna eat it."
14,"00:01:29,631","00:01:31,381","- Just go crazy with it.
- Yeah."
15,"00:01:31,716","00:01:33,258","this little gizmo
right here,"
16,"00:01:33,343","00:01:34,593","and we're gonna
choose a frequency."
17,"00:01:34,761","00:01:35,928","We're gonna choose
the frequency."
18,"00:01:36,012","00:01:37,137","You would intently
watch this plate."
19,"00:01:37,597","00:01:38,806","Let's see what happens
to the sand."
20,"00:01:38,973","00:01:40,474","Because very interesting,
magical things"
21,"00:01:40,558","00:01:41,850",- will happen to the sand.
22,"00:01:46,523","00:01:47,815",So...
23,"00:01:50,235","00:01:51,944","are you ready to meet
your new brother?"
24,"00:01:52,654","00:01:54,196","Do you think
we'll like each other,"
25,"00:01:54,280","00:01:56,657","like real brothers
and sisters?"
26,"00:01:57,367","00:01:59,201","I think we'll all
love each other."
27,"00:02:01,162","00:02:04,206","Out of this wide,
wide universe..."
28,"00:02:04,791","00:02:06,750",this huge universe...
29,"00:02:07,836","00:02:09,628",with all these brothers
30,"00:02:09,712","00:02:12,798","and sisters and moms
and dads..."
31,"00:02:15,176","00:02:16,760",he found us.
32,"00:02:17,554","00:02:19,888",And we found each other.
33,"00:02:20,056","00:02:21,181",That's pretty rare.
34,"00:02:21,349","00:02:22,516",That's pretty cool.
35,"00:02:24,102","00:02:26,019","Okay, so..."
36,"00:02:26,187","00:02:29,356",This is our love.
37,"00:02:35,196","00:02:36,238",Don't worry.
38,"00:02:36,406","00:02:37,656",It's not gone.
39,"00:02:37,824","00:02:40,576","It's just...
It's just enfolded."
40,"00:02:41,286","00:02:42,995",Love is always there.
41,"00:02:43,163","00:02:45,038",Even if you don't feel it...
42,"00:02:47,125","00:02:49,585",it's always there for you.
43,"00:03:31,169","00:03:32,586",Not gone...
44,"00:03:40,345","00:03:41,929",just enfolded.
45,"00:04:00,490","00:04:01,490",Hey.
46,"00:04:02,033","00:04:03,033","Hi, Meg."
47,"00:04:03,701","00:04:05,410",Let's be exclusive.
48,"00:04:06,871","00:04:07,871",What?
49,"00:04:08,039","00:04:11,333","That's my new word
for the day. Exclusive."
50,"00:04:11,501","00:04:12,501",Do you like it?
51,"00:04:14,462","00:04:16,088","Love it, Biscuits."
52,"00:04:20,426","00:04:22,052",Couldn't sleep either?
53,"00:04:23,471","00:04:25,639","Why didn't you just come up
to my room?"
54,"00:04:26,349","00:04:28,267","'Cause I knew
you'd be down."
55,"00:04:33,147","00:04:35,857",Hey. You made sandwiches.
56,"00:04:36,025","00:04:37,609",And I'm cooking milk.
57,"00:04:38,778","00:04:41,405","This is a lot of milk,
Charles Wallace."
58,"00:04:41,572","00:04:43,532",It's good to be prepared.
59,"00:04:43,700","00:04:46,118","You never know
who will stop by."
60,"00:04:47,370","00:04:48,870",And I'm Michele Norris.
61,"00:04:49,038","00:04:51,456","Tomorrow marks
the four-year anniversary..."
62,"00:04:51,624","00:04:55,460","of the disappearance of NASA
scientist Dr. Alex Murry."
63,"00:04:55,628","00:04:56,837",Dr. Murry went missing
64,"00:04:56,921","00:04:57,921","just a week
after publicly announcing..."
65,"00:04:58,089","00:04:59,256","They're talking
about Daddy."
66,"00:04:59,424","00:05:01,717","he could travel
the universe with his mind."
67,"00:05:01,884","00:05:04,469","91
billion light-years traveled,"
68,"00:05:04,554","00:05:05,637",like that.
69,"00:05:05,805","00:05:08,265","Authorities
note there are still"
70,"00:05:08,349","00:05:10,475",no leads in the case.
71,"00:05:19,944","00:05:21,570","Everybody say,
""Hi, Meg. """
72,"00:05:21,738","00:05:23,280","Hi, Meg."
73,"00:05:27,368","00:05:28,410","Hi, Meg."
74,"00:06:11,287","00:06:12,412","I mean, he's been gone"
75,"00:06:12,497","00:06:14,081",four years to the day.
76,"00:06:14,248","00:06:16,124","He's probably just pretending
to be in outer space..."
77,"00:06:16,292","00:06:18,251","but he's really
hiding out in Tijuana."
78,"00:06:18,419","00:06:20,212","I bet
it involves another woman."
79,"00:06:20,380","00:06:21,630","Either that
or a Martian."
80,"00:06:21,798","00:06:24,216","Seriously though,
something so horrible"
81,"00:06:24,300","00:06:25,384","had to have happened
to him."
82,"00:06:25,551","00:06:26,885","To leave his kids
like that?"
83,"00:06:27,053","00:06:29,179","And just after
they adopted Charles Wallace."
84,"00:06:29,722","00:06:31,223",They seemed so happy.
85,"00:06:31,391","00:06:34,518","And Meg used to be so engaged,
and now she is a mess."
86,"00:06:34,685","00:06:36,061",But the boy is brilliant.
87,"00:06:36,229","00:06:38,605","- Absolutely brilliant. Oh.
- But odd, so odd!"
88,"00:06:38,689","00:06:39,689","I guess
I would be too"
89,"00:06:39,774","00:06:40,774",if my dad ran away?
90,"00:06:41,234","00:06:43,193","Shame on you
for talking like that!"
91,"00:06:44,237","00:06:45,779","Oh.
My dear, I'm sorry..."
92,"00:06:45,863","00:06:46,863","And I'm not odd, you are..."
93,"00:06:47,031","00:06:49,324","because you think making up
mean stories about people..."
94,"00:06:49,492","00:06:50,867","makes you feel better
about yourselves."
95,"00:06:51,035","00:06:52,577","Well, it doesn't,
does it?"
96,"00:06:52,745","00:06:54,663","Charles Wallace, we don't
talk to teachers like that!"
97,"00:06:54,831","00:06:56,039",And Meg might be a mess...
98,"00:06:56,207","00:06:57,749","but she has
more potential in her pinky..."
99,"00:06:57,917","00:06:59,584","than you do
in your whole body!"
100,"00:07:00,378","00:07:02,629","Did you hear that, Meg? Meg!"
101,"00:07:02,797","00:07:06,425","Over here. Did you hear that?
Meg! You may be a mess..."
102,"00:07:06,592","00:07:08,927","but you have more potential
than anybody here!"
103,"00:07:10,054","00:07:11,638","Oh, no, no, no."
104,"00:07:11,806","00:07:12,806",Mommy was awkward
105,"00:07:12,890","00:07:14,099","and funny-looking
at your age, too!"
106,"00:07:14,559","00:07:17,602","And look at her now.
She's beautiful!"
107,"00:07:21,232","00:07:24,276","So, looks like crazy
runs in the family."
108,"00:07:27,447","00:07:28,655",What did you just say?
109,"00:07:30,241","00:07:31,950",I see why your dad left.
110,"00:07:34,745","00:07:36,830","Who does she even think
that she's talking to?"
111,"00:07:36,998","00:07:38,165","Hey, Veronica."
112,"00:07:53,639","00:07:55,599","You're next, Charles Wallace."
113,"00:08:02,273","00:08:05,817","Veronica Kiley's
parents are on their way here."
114,"00:08:05,985","00:08:08,320","They're worried for
their daughter's safety."
115,"00:08:08,488","00:08:10,280",Their daughter is mean.
116,"00:08:12,450","00:08:14,201",You hit her in the face.
117,"00:08:26,339","00:08:27,672",You...
118,"00:08:27,798","00:08:29,090",You were a top student.
119,"00:08:29,800","00:08:31,301",Top attitude.
120,"00:08:31,844","00:08:33,345",But look at you now. You...
121,"00:08:34,555","00:08:36,890","You're aggressive,
you're hostile..."
122,"00:08:37,058","00:08:38,266",you shut everybody out...
123,"00:08:38,976","00:08:41,019","and then wonder
why they don't like you."
124,"00:08:42,021","00:08:44,439","I don't wonder
and I don't care."
125,"00:08:47,652","00:08:48,652",Well...
126,"00:08:49,737","00:08:51,696",maybe that's your problem.
127,"00:08:52,198","00:08:53,823",I don't have a problem.
128,"00:08:54,909","00:08:56,868","You can't keep using
your father's disappearance"
129,"00:08:56,953","00:08:58,578",as an excuse to act out.
130,"00:08:59,497","00:09:01,164","What do you think he would say
about all this?"
131,"00:09:01,332","00:09:04,292","Seriously. If he walked
in that door today..."
132,"00:09:05,461","00:09:06,628",what would happen?
133,"00:09:10,591","00:09:12,926","The world would
make sense again."
134,"00:09:17,807","00:09:20,141",Listen.
135,"00:09:20,226","00:09:23,478","All I'm saying is,
it's been four years."
136,"00:09:26,315","00:09:29,901","Odds are he's not
coming back."
137,"00:09:37,159","00:09:39,661","I did not excuse you,
young lady. Meg."
138,"00:09:40,329","00:09:42,831","I want you to write an apology
to Principal Jenkins."
139,"00:09:47,420","00:09:49,296",And one to Veronica.
140,"00:09:50,631","00:09:51,715",Mom!
141,"00:09:52,383","00:09:54,676","She called
Charles Wallace crazy!"
142,"00:09:54,844","00:09:56,553",That's no excuse.
143,"00:10:01,267","00:10:02,392","Well, Dad always told me"
144,"00:10:02,476","00:10:04,102","to stand up
for what I believe in."
145,"00:10:12,236","00:10:14,362",Don't use Dad like that.
146,"00:10:15,239","00:10:16,906",It's not fair.
147,"00:10:23,414","00:10:26,166","He's not coming back,
is he?"
148,"00:10:34,675","00:10:37,260","Don't give up hope, Meglet."
149,"00:10:40,473","00:10:42,849","I knew
it was you! Come on in."
150,"00:10:43,517","00:10:46,728","Wow! Talk about
a dark and stormy night."
151,"00:10:46,896","00:10:49,606","Are those
Mrs. Buncombe's sheets?"
152,"00:10:49,774","00:10:50,774",Maybe.
153,"00:10:56,864","00:10:57,822",Excuse me.
154,"00:10:57,990","00:11:00,450","Oh, aren't you dazzling!
You must be Dr. Murry."
155,"00:11:00,618","00:11:01,993",Yes. And...
156,"00:11:02,161","00:11:03,828",Your house is so warm.
157,"00:11:03,996","00:11:05,997","You've done a wonderful job
keeping the darkness out."
158,"00:11:07,416","00:11:09,250",Mom. Mom!
159,"00:11:09,418","00:11:11,378",Do you want me to call 911?
160,"00:11:11,545","00:11:13,338","Well, almost all the darkness."
161,"00:11:13,506","00:11:15,048",You must be Meg.
162,"00:11:15,800","00:11:17,467","How... How do you
know my name?"
163,"00:11:17,635","00:11:18,760",Because I told her.
164,"00:11:18,844","00:11:20,637","Guys, calm down."
165,"00:11:20,805","00:11:23,014","Don't worry.
She's my friend."
166,"00:11:24,100","00:11:25,767",Call me Mrs. Whatsit.
167,"00:11:26,894","00:11:27,977",Mrs. Who?
168,"00:11:28,312","00:11:29,688","No, Mrs. Whatsit."
169,"00:11:29,855","00:11:31,314",Mrs. Who is...
170,"00:11:31,482","00:11:32,732","She's, like,
a billion years older"
171,"00:11:32,817","00:11:33,942","and way more
knowledgeable."
172,"00:11:34,777","00:11:37,946","What can I do for you,
Mrs. Whatsit?"
173,"00:11:38,781","00:11:40,115",I caught her stealing sheets.
174,"00:11:40,282","00:11:42,158","Guys, she's harmless."
175,"00:11:42,326","00:11:44,619",You're six. Come on.
176,"00:11:44,787","00:11:46,121","What do you know
about harmless?"
177,"00:11:46,288","00:11:47,956",Have I ever been wrong?
178,"00:11:48,124","00:11:50,333","One of these days,
you might be, Charles Wallace."
179,"00:11:50,501","00:11:51,501","Oh, I highly doubt that."
180,"00:11:51,669","00:11:53,795","He's one of the greatest minds
in recent history."
181,"00:11:54,505","00:11:55,797",He's prodigious.
182,"00:11:56,298","00:11:59,467","But of course, we can't take
any credit for our talents."
183,"00:11:59,635","00:12:02,011","It's how we use them
that counts."
184,"00:12:04,598","00:12:06,683","Okay, then.
The thing is..."
185,"00:12:07,101","00:12:10,186","we don't know you,
and it's late, so..."
186,"00:12:10,730","00:12:13,314","Oh, is it?
I'm terrible with time."
187,"00:12:14,191","00:12:16,192","Mrs. Which
usually handles that."
188,"00:12:16,861","00:12:18,403",Right.
189,"00:12:19,864","00:12:20,905","The thing is,"
190,"00:12:21,574","00:12:24,534","the kids need
to get to bed..."
191,"00:12:24,702","00:12:27,328","so if you don't mind
visiting some other time."
192,"00:12:28,789","00:12:30,832","Oh, of course I will."
193,"00:12:32,084","00:12:34,836","I just wanna tell you
one thing before I go."
194,"00:12:42,428","00:12:44,846","I want you to know
that no matter what happens..."
195,"00:12:46,348","00:12:49,976","you and your husband achieved
something truly extraordinary."
196,"00:12:51,270","00:12:53,313","What are you
talking about?"
197,"00:12:53,481","00:12:55,023",Just that there really is
198,"00:12:55,107","00:12:57,859","such a thing
as a tesseract."
199,"00:12:58,944","00:13:00,028",What?
200,"00:13:04,533","00:13:06,493",A tesseract?
201,"00:13:06,660","00:13:08,745","That's what I said.
Tesseract."
202,"00:13:08,913","00:13:11,456","Is... Is this
some kind of joke?"
203,"00:13:11,624","00:13:13,750","Did Veronica
put you up to this?"
204,"00:13:13,918","00:13:16,461","You really don't
trust easily, do you?"
205,"00:13:18,255","00:13:20,131","Charles Wallace,
I'm not sure about Meg."
206,"00:13:20,466","00:13:21,966",Give her a chance.
207,"00:13:22,593","00:13:23,802",Okay.
208,"00:13:23,969","00:13:25,720",You're the boss.
209,"00:13:25,888","00:13:27,555",I better run.
210,"00:13:29,767","00:13:33,394",Ah! Wild nights are my glory.
211,"00:13:52,998","00:13:54,624",Never do that again.
212,"00:13:54,792","00:13:57,877","Never let anyone in the house
without our permission."
213,"00:13:58,045","00:14:02,048","And please stop talking
to strangers."
214,"00:14:02,216","00:14:04,175","I don't
talk to them, they talk to me."
215,"00:14:04,343","00:14:05,927","Doesn't mean
you have to answer."
216,"00:14:06,095","00:14:08,304","Now,
that's just bad manners, Meg."
217,"00:14:08,389","00:14:10,139",Charles Wallace.
218,"00:14:10,307","00:14:11,349","Hey, buddy!"
219,"00:14:11,517","00:14:12,600",How's it going?
220,"00:14:12,768","00:14:14,060",I'm cool.
221,"00:14:14,979","00:14:16,396","Hello, princess."
222,"00:14:18,774","00:14:20,525","See?
Told ya."
223,"00:14:20,609","00:14:22,485","Yeah, be yourself."
224,"00:14:25,781","00:14:27,407",Don't be like me.
225,"00:14:27,992","00:14:29,617","What's wrong
with being like you?"
226,"00:14:31,370","00:14:32,871",You have a pretty good arm.
227,"00:14:34,540","00:14:35,498",Veronica.
228,"00:14:36,208","00:14:37,458",Direct hit.
229,"00:14:40,379","00:14:42,255","Hi. I'm Charles Wallace,
Meg's brother."
230,"00:14:42,423","00:14:44,257","- You're Calvin, aren't you?
That I am."
231,"00:14:45,759","00:14:47,427",What are you doing here?
232,"00:14:48,053","00:14:49,637",I don't know.
233,"00:14:50,639","00:14:52,307",I was doing my homework...
234,"00:14:52,474","00:14:53,641","and suddenly
I got this feeling"
235,"00:14:53,726","00:14:54,851",that I had to come here.
236,"00:14:55,895","00:14:57,145","Like, right here."
237,"00:14:57,521","00:14:58,563",Is that weird?
238,"00:15:00,107","00:15:01,649",Maybe a little.
239,"00:15:01,859","00:15:04,569","The truth is,
you were called here."
240,"00:15:04,737","00:15:06,362",You're good at diplomacy.
241,"00:15:07,156","00:15:09,532","What do we need diplomacy for,
Charles Wallace?"
242,"00:15:09,700","00:15:12,076","Well, the fact that you asked
is exactly why we need it."
243,"00:15:13,203","00:15:15,079","So what do you say, Calvin,
you wanna come with us?"
244,"00:15:18,083","00:15:19,000",Sure.
245,"00:15:19,460","00:15:20,627",Why not?
246,"00:15:22,212","00:15:23,254",Great.
247,"00:15:23,422","00:15:25,340",Let's go meet Mrs. Who.
248,"00:15:26,133","00:15:28,343","No! No, Charles Wallace!"
249,"00:15:28,510","00:15:30,094","Charles Wallace,
do not go in there."
250,"00:15:30,596","00:15:33,139","That house is falling apart,
it's off-limits."
251,"00:15:33,474","00:15:35,433",He's a fearless little guy.
252,"00:15:35,517","00:15:37,435",Unfortunately.
253,"00:15:39,521","00:15:41,064",I told you no.
254,"00:15:41,231","00:15:43,441","We cannot go in there.
It's not safe."
255,"00:15:43,859","00:15:46,653","It's practically
the safest place..."
256,"00:15:46,820","00:15:48,488",in the universe.
257,"00:15:53,243","00:15:54,452",Look.
258,"00:16:10,719","00:16:12,428","Mrs. Who, it's me,
Charles Wallace."
259,"00:16:12,513","00:16:14,514",Oh.
260,"00:16:33,701","00:16:35,493","""Life without love..."
261,"00:16:35,661","00:16:38,413","""is like a tree
without blossoms or fruit. """
262,"00:16:39,373","00:16:41,833","Gibran, Lebanese."
263,"00:16:43,877","00:16:46,337",Calvin. American.
264,"00:16:46,672","00:16:47,755",Mrs. Who prefers
265,"00:16:47,840","00:16:49,382",not to think for herself.
266,"00:16:49,550","00:16:52,218","That's just rude,
Charles Wallace."
267,"00:16:52,386","00:16:54,929","No. She's just evolved
past language..."
268,"00:16:55,097","00:16:56,806","so when
she needs to think..."
269,"00:16:56,974","00:16:59,767","she cheats and uses
other people's words."
270,"00:16:59,935","00:17:01,394","It's nice how
she gives them credit."
271,"00:17:01,979","00:17:04,939","Mrs. Who, meet my Meg."
272,"00:17:09,486","00:17:10,486",Okay.
273,"00:17:11,655","00:17:12,697",Okay.
274,"00:17:16,618","00:17:20,538","""The wound is the place
where the light enters you. """
275,"00:17:22,791","00:17:25,293","Rumi, Persian."
276,"00:17:34,053","00:17:35,845",Poor Mrs. Who.
277,"00:17:35,929","00:17:37,138",We tired her out.
278,"00:17:37,473","00:17:39,390","I guess she was
really tired."
279,"00:17:40,768","00:17:41,934",She's still adjusting.
280,"00:17:42,436","00:17:44,187",Adjusting to what?
281,"00:17:45,314","00:17:47,065","Sorry, you're almost,"
282,"00:17:47,149","00:17:49,025","but not quite ready
to find out."
283,"00:17:49,109","00:17:50,068",Charles Wallace...
284,"00:17:50,235","00:17:51,235","whatever she is,"
285,"00:17:51,320","00:17:53,279","whatever that is,
whatever all this is..."
286,"00:17:53,447","00:17:54,572",I don't like it.
287,"00:17:54,740","00:17:55,823",You'll manage.
288,"00:17:57,576","00:18:00,119","Come on, time to go.
Let's let Mrs. Who rest."
289,"00:18:01,205","00:18:03,456","We'll see her again
very soon."
290,"00:18:08,295","00:18:09,420","Charles Wallace,
can you,"
291,"00:18:09,505","00:18:10,755","pass me the pepper, please?"
292,"00:18:11,507","00:18:12,924",Thank you.
293,"00:18:13,092","00:18:14,467","So, they met in college."
294,"00:18:14,551","00:18:15,968",She was tutoring him.
295,"00:18:16,136","00:18:17,970","It's a great story,
actually."
296,"00:18:18,138","00:18:19,388","Oh, really?"
297,"00:18:19,973","00:18:21,557",Is that his work?
298,"00:18:24,061","00:18:25,645","Mommy's, too."
299,"00:18:25,813","00:18:26,813",Cool.
300,"00:18:27,439","00:18:29,065",What's it about?
301,"00:18:34,947","00:18:36,114",Well...
302,"00:18:37,491","00:18:40,159","I'm mostly interested
in the small..."
303,"00:18:41,370","00:18:43,579","atoms, particles..."
304,"00:18:44,081","00:18:48,167","the unseeable energies
that move through us all."
305,"00:18:48,335","00:18:49,836",Go get 'em.
306,"00:18:50,295","00:18:53,422","Their dad
is all about the big."
307,"00:18:58,595","00:19:02,348","So, what if
we are here for a reason?"
308,"00:19:03,183","00:19:05,351","What if we are not just
in the universe..."
309,"00:19:05,519","00:19:09,480","but the universe
is within all of us?"
310,"00:19:09,648","00:19:11,732","Think about
quantum entanglement."
311,"00:19:11,900","00:19:14,610","Two electrons
once bonded together,"
312,"00:19:14,695","00:19:15,987","in love, if you will..."
313,"00:19:16,155","00:19:18,114","suddenly separated
by a galaxy..."
314,"00:19:18,282","00:19:20,575","but somehow
still just as connected."
315,"00:19:21,118","00:19:25,079","An unbroken union
despite being galaxies apart."
316,"00:19:25,247","00:19:26,956","And our most
recent calculations show us"
317,"00:19:27,040","00:19:29,417","that these fields
connect us..."
318,"00:19:29,585","00:19:31,711",to other dimensions.
319,"00:19:31,879","00:19:33,880","Dimensions outside
of the limitations"
320,"00:19:33,964","00:19:35,131",of space and time.
321,"00:19:35,299","00:19:36,966",Imagine that. Imagine...
322,"00:19:37,134","00:19:38,968","rather than enduring
the oppressive rules"
323,"00:19:39,052","00:19:42,138","of time and space,
we could wrinkle it."
324,"00:19:42,306","00:19:46,559","91 billion light-years
traveled, like that."
325,"00:19:48,854","00:19:50,146",And we don't need rockets.
326,"00:19:50,314","00:19:52,148","We don't need spaceships.
We don't need anything."
327,"00:19:52,232","00:19:54,192",To utilize a tesseract...
328,"00:19:54,359","00:19:58,487","all you need is to tap into
the right frequency."
329,"00:19:58,864","00:20:01,157",You just need your mind.
330,"00:20:10,459","00:20:12,919","He wanted
to touch the stars..."
331,"00:20:13,462","00:20:15,546","unlock the secrets
of the universe..."
332,"00:20:15,714","00:20:17,465",Find its origin and...
333,"00:20:19,009","00:20:20,676",shake its hand.
334,"00:20:23,472","00:20:25,223",You messed up.
335,"00:20:25,390","00:20:26,474",You were impatient.
336,"00:20:26,642","00:20:28,100",You couldn't follow the plan.
337,"00:20:28,268","00:20:29,727","Couldn't you see it
in their eyes?"
338,"00:20:29,811","00:20:31,062","It was written
all over their faces."
339,"00:20:31,230","00:20:32,605",They weren't ready.
340,"00:20:32,773","00:20:34,023",They're not...
341,"00:20:34,191","00:20:36,525","Kate, they're not ready,
so what are we supposed to do?"
342,"00:20:36,693","00:20:38,736","We're supposed to wait
until they catch up with us?"
343,"00:20:38,904","00:20:42,156","We are on the precipice
of something spectacular!"
344,"00:20:42,324","00:20:44,242","Listen, listen, listen.
Look. Hear me out."
345,"00:20:44,826","00:20:47,828","So, in order to be great..."
346,"00:20:47,996","00:20:50,498","it isn't enough
just to be right."
347,"00:20:50,666","00:20:53,834","You have to actually
be great."
348,"00:20:55,879","00:20:57,546",And we are.
349,"00:20:59,007","00:21:02,176","So, why can't we help
the others along?"
350,"00:21:04,179","00:21:05,179",Yes.
351,"00:21:09,726","00:21:12,228","Or we could just
beat them up."
352,"00:21:12,396","00:21:13,771",Let's beat them up.
353,"00:21:13,939","00:21:15,439","Honestly, it'd be
so much fun."
354,"00:21:15,607","00:21:18,484",Come here. Come here.
355,"00:21:18,652","00:21:19,694","Oh, God."
356,"00:21:20,612","00:21:23,322","I almost lost you.
I got so scared."
357,"00:21:23,490","00:21:25,241","You crazy,
brilliant scientist."
358,"00:21:35,961","00:21:37,878","You know,
you have great hair."
359,"00:21:40,382","00:21:41,424",What?
360,"00:21:42,009","00:21:43,175","No, I don't."
361,"00:21:43,719","00:21:44,927",Please don't say that.
362,"00:21:45,762","00:21:46,762",Okay.
363,"00:21:51,018","00:21:52,727",I had a great time.
364,"00:21:55,689","00:21:59,692",Your mom is insanely nice.
365,"00:22:01,903","00:22:03,195",Your house is warm.
366,"00:22:03,363","00:22:04,905",It smells good.
367,"00:22:05,073","00:22:06,741",And it's full of...
368,"00:22:09,453","00:22:10,453",I don't know what.
369,"00:22:11,455","00:22:12,872",But it's amazing.
370,"00:22:17,419","00:22:19,754",It's far from amazing.
371,"00:22:20,964","00:22:24,258","My mom's upstairs in her room
preparing for yet another..."
372,"00:22:24,426","00:22:28,012","parent-teacher conference
for her delinquent daughter."
373,"00:22:34,853","00:22:36,062","Oh, no. Not now."
374,"00:22:36,229","00:22:37,063",Come here.
375,"00:22:40,233","00:22:42,193","- Veronica's your neighbor?
Yes."
376,"00:22:42,361","00:22:44,111","Come here, please."
377,"00:22:44,279","00:22:46,280","So you're embarrassed
to be seen with me?"
378,"00:22:48,075","00:22:49,283","Yeah, right."
379,"00:22:49,993","00:22:51,202",Other way around.
380,"00:22:51,370","00:22:53,079","She's gonna tell everybody
that you were here with me."
381,"00:22:53,580","00:22:55,706","And I'm just trying
to protect your reputation..."
382,"00:22:55,874","00:22:57,833",so can you come here?
383,"00:22:58,001","00:23:00,378","She already saw us,
besides..."
384,"00:23:00,545","00:23:02,213","there's nothing
to be embarrassed about."
385,"00:23:04,091","00:23:05,716",You say that now...
386,"00:23:05,884","00:23:08,552","but you don't know
what it's like"
387,"00:23:08,637","00:23:10,513","having every move
you make..."
388,"00:23:10,680","00:23:13,015",mocked and ridiculed.
389,"00:23:14,393","00:23:16,310",You'd be surprised.
390,"00:23:17,646","00:23:18,979","Come on, Calvin."

392,"00:23:20,649","00:23:22,691",Even the teachers.
393,"00:23:24,194","00:23:25,945",You do everything perfectly.

397,"00:23:35,789","00:23:37,957",You must really miss him.
398,"00:23:40,335","00:23:42,837","More than anything
in the universe."
399,"00:23:43,588","00:23:45,506","Then how about
we go and find him?"
400,"00:23:49,219","00:23:50,928","I've never understood
the point of fences."
401,"00:23:51,096","00:23:52,763","Wait.
What are you doing here?"
402,"00:23:56,393","00:23:59,395","This is it, kids!
This is it!"
403,"00:24:00,272","00:24:02,481","No! Hey, no! You're supposed
to be upstairs!"

409,"00:24:15,454","00:24:18,122","I did it, Mrs. Who.
I got them ready."
410,"00:24:18,290","00:24:21,542","And not a moment
too soon, my little warrior."
411,"00:24:21,710","00:24:23,210","- What was that?
- Who said that?"
412,"00:24:23,378","00:24:24,503",Not Who.
413,"00:24:24,671","00:24:26,839",Which. Mrs. Which.

of the puzzle."
415,"00:24:41,021","00:24:42,521","Come on, Mrs. Which,
show yourself."
416,"00:24:45,233","00:24:46,525",How's this?
417,"00:24:48,111","00:24:49,695",Is this good?
418,"00:24:52,991","00:24:55,075",Great. Perfect.
419,"00:24:55,702","00:24:56,785",Wonderful!

Mrs. Which."
421,"00:24:59,206","00:25:02,041","Is there such thing
as the wrong size?"
422,"00:25:02,209","00:25:03,501","No, no. Never."
423,"00:25:03,668","00:25:05,377","And... And might I say
how honored I am"
424,"00:25:05,462","00:25:07,755","to be on this,
my very first mission."
425,"00:25:08,256","00:25:10,090","I was chosen
for my great verbalizing"

428,"00:25:15,305","00:25:18,015",I am a part of the universe.
429,"00:25:18,183","00:25:19,266","Just like you, Meg."
430,"00:25:20,435","00:25:21,977","What... What do you
want with us?"
431,"00:25:22,145","00:25:24,396","I don't know
about her, Charles Wallace."
432,"00:25:24,564","00:25:27,983","But I have a very good vibe
from this Calvin kid."
433,"00:25:28,860","00:25:30,945","Let's focus, shall we?"
434,"00:25:32,364","00:25:35,908","We heard a call,
out in the universe."
435,"00:25:35,992","00:25:37,159",A human call.
436,"00:25:37,911","00:25:39,370",A desperate one.
437,"00:25:40,038","00:25:41,956","We couldn't tell
where it was coming from..."
438,"00:25:42,123","00:25:45,584","so we followed it here,
to its destination."
439,"00:25:48,505","00:25:52,216","It brought them here, Meg.
To our house."
440,"00:25:54,469","00:25:56,428","The call
must have been Daddy's."
441,"00:26:00,517","00:26:02,434",My father's alive?
442,"00:26:04,271","00:26:05,271",We believe he is.
443,"00:26:06,106","00:26:08,524","Your father has done
an extraordinary thing."
444,"00:26:08,692","00:26:12,653","No human has ever traveled
so far out in the universe."
445,"00:26:13,196","00:26:14,822",But he may be in danger.
446,"00:26:15,907","00:26:18,325","And we're here
to help you find him."
447,"00:26:20,829","00:26:23,080","Why would you
wanna do that?"
448,"00:26:24,124","00:26:25,457",Because that's what we do.
449,"00:26:26,293","00:26:27,418",We're warriors who serve
450,"00:26:27,502","00:26:29,628","the good and light

451,"00:26:29,796","00:26:32,756","Sometimes we rescue,
sometimes we guide."
452,"00:26:32,924","00:26:34,466",Think of us as big-hearted.
453,"00:26:34,634","00:26:35,634",Indeed.
454,"00:26:36,094","00:26:39,597","Listen, Meg. We must find him
as soon as we can."
455,"00:26:41,558","00:26:43,475",Are you up for it?
456,"00:26:49,858","00:26:51,400",I bet she says no.
457,"00:26:51,568","00:26:52,610",What?
458,"00:26:54,029","00:26:54,987",No.
459,"00:26:55,071","00:26:55,988",No.
460,"00:26:56,156","00:26:58,490","No, yes. No. Yes, I'm going."
461,"00:26:59,576","00:27:00,826","Of course, I am."
462,"00:27:01,620","00:27:03,078",And we know I'm up for it.
463,"00:27:03,246","00:27:05,122","And Calvin already said
he'd come."
464,"00:27:05,707","00:27:06,832",I did?
465,"00:27:07,751","00:27:08,667",I did.
466,"00:27:08,835","00:27:09,918",Then let's go!
467,"00:27:10,378","00:27:12,212","Mom. Wait.
We gotta get Mom."
468,"00:27:12,380","00:27:14,590","We'll get
your mother later. I promise."
469,"00:27:14,758","00:27:16,091","Don't worry, Meg."
470,"00:27:16,259","00:27:19,595","Tessering is almost nearly
perfectly natural."
471,"00:27:20,347","00:27:21,347",Tessering?

474,"00:27:26,770","00:27:30,022","Wait. No, no. Charles Wallace,
don't go over there."
475,"00:27:30,190","00:27:31,857","No time to waste, Meg."
476,"00:27:32,192","00:27:33,942","Come on, Mrs. Whatsit!"
477,"00:27:40,533","00:27:43,786","You just have
to find the right frequency..."
478,"00:27:44,204","00:27:45,996",and have faith in who you are.
479,"00:28:03,181","00:28:05,349",Let's find your father.

484,"00:28:40,885","00:28:43,929","We did it, Meg. We actually,
really, very much so tessered!"
485,"00:28:45,473","00:28:48,100",Why does my whole body hurt?
486,"00:28:48,268","00:28:50,144","We were in your backyard
and now..."
487,"00:28:53,690","00:28:54,898",It's real.

she's all right."
489,"00:28:59,237","00:29:00,237","Yes, she's fine."
490,"00:29:00,405","00:29:03,157","Whatsit, we don't kick people."
491,"00:29:03,241","00:29:05,075","Oh, I didn't know."

589,"00:38:25,886","00:38:28,013","Oh, yes, a seer!"
590,"00:38:28,180","00:38:29,806","We should go visit
one of the seers."
591,"00:38:29,974","00:38:31,474","They'll narrow
the search for us."
592,"00:38:31,642","00:38:32,892",What's a seer?
593,"00:38:33,060","00:38:34,394",A moderate visionary.
594,"00:38:34,562","00:38:37,397","An occasional motivator
of insight. Hit or miss."
595,"00:38:37,565","00:38:39,024",But I know a very cute one.
596,"00:38:39,191","00:38:40,608",I mean a good one.
597,"00:38:42,611","00:38:44,612",That sounds sort of promising.
598,"00:38:45,823","00:38:48,450","Misses, grab a child."
599,"00:38:48,909","00:38:50,952",Our journey continues.
600,"00:39:29,700","00:39:31,618",She's intact.
601,"00:39:31,786","00:39:33,036",She's fine.
602,"00:39:33,204","00:39:36,748","Fine?
After that beautiful tesser?"
603,"00:39:36,916","00:39:38,083",She should be glorious.
604,"00:39:38,250","00:39:39,626",Everyone else is glorious.
605,"00:39:39,794","00:39:41,503",She makes absolutely no sense.
606,"00:39:42,380","00:39:44,756","I absolutely do not understand
that girl whatsoever."
607,"00:39:44,924","00:39:46,341","Okay, it's over here."
608,"00:39:46,509","00:39:48,176","Wait till you see it.
It's so cool."
609,"00:39:48,344","00:39:49,761",The seer lives here?
610,"00:39:53,140","00:39:56,476",Wow. You're our size.
611,"00:39:56,644","00:39:57,644",The three of you...
612,"00:39:58,813","00:40:00,605",are beautiful.
613,"00:40:01,315","00:40:02,690",Thank you.
614,"00:40:02,858","00:40:04,442",And so are you.
615,"00:40:10,991","00:40:12,367",Where are we?
616,"00:40:12,827","00:40:14,285",Orion.
617,"00:40:14,453","00:40:17,122",Home of the Happy Medium.
618,"00:40:19,375","00:40:21,376","So this guy
is your boyfriend?"
619,"00:40:21,544","00:40:22,544","Well, when you're"
620,"00:40:22,628","00:40:24,712","over a billion years old,
you don't really need labels."
621,"00:40:25,464","00:40:28,133",Why do I have to be in pain?
622,"00:40:28,300","00:40:30,301","- Instead of...
- Glorious?"
623,"00:40:32,263","00:40:34,597",You don't tesser well.
624,"00:40:34,765","00:40:36,266",In what way?
625,"00:40:36,434","00:40:40,437","Because I don't feel or see
anything when we tesser."
626,"00:40:40,604","00:40:43,565","And you won't
until you become..."
627,"00:40:43,732","00:40:46,985","one with the universe
and yourself."
628,"00:40:47,153","00:40:48,903","As it is, it seems like..."
629,"00:40:49,071","00:40:52,365","you don't even want
to return as yourself."
630,"00:40:52,867","00:40:54,075",Oh...
631,"00:40:54,452","00:40:58,079","Is there any way
I can return as somebody else?"
632,"00:40:59,248","00:41:00,915",That I might like?
633,"00:41:06,881","00:41:08,256",Do you realize...
634,"00:41:10,217","00:41:14,220",how many events and choices...
635,"00:41:15,681","00:41:19,767","that had to occur since
the birth of the universe..."
636,"00:41:20,686","00:41:25,857","leading to the making
of you..."
637,"00:41:26,901","00:41:31,696",just exactly the way you are?
638,"00:41:38,871","00:41:41,915","I guess I never really
thought about that."
639,"00:41:44,627","00:41:45,752",Maybe now's the time
640,"00:41:45,836","00:41:47,295",to start thinking about it.
641,"00:41:49,798","00:41:51,216",We are here!
642,"00:41:51,383","00:41:53,510","You can do it, Meg.
You just need balance."
643,"00:41:55,137","00:41:56,346",This is awesome!
644,"00:41:56,514","00:41:58,181","No, not awesome!"
645,"00:41:58,349","00:42:00,058",Anybody home?
646,"00:42:01,810","00:42:03,853","Nice balance, Mrs. Who."
647,"00:42:07,024","00:42:08,691","Oh, no, no, no."
648,"00:42:12,279","00:42:14,614","Finally, a little color."
649,"00:42:28,921","00:42:29,921",Who's there?
650,"00:42:31,340","00:42:33,841","Uninvited guest
is very unsettling!"
651,"00:42:34,760","00:42:36,427",I do not like visitation!
652,"00:42:37,388","00:42:38,429",Whatsit.
653,"00:42:40,224","00:42:41,933",I really need a doorbell.
654,"00:42:49,775","00:42:51,985","Well, you obviously
don't understand"
655,"00:42:52,069","00:42:53,278",the importance of balance...
656,"00:42:53,445","00:42:54,946",of moderation...
657,"00:42:56,907","00:42:58,408",of the Happy Medium.
658,"00:42:58,742","00:43:00,451",You sound like my mother.
659,"00:43:00,786","00:43:02,537",Is your mother a baritone?
660,"00:43:04,039","00:43:05,415","How's it going, Happy?"
661,"00:43:05,583","00:43:07,250","Everything's fine, Whatsit.
You look nice."
662,"00:43:07,418","00:43:09,335","I do?
- I like your outfit."
663,"00:43:10,045","00:43:11,921",It's like a person outfit.
664,"00:43:12,089","00:43:13,673","Oh, thank you."
665,"00:43:13,841","00:43:15,466",You look like a person.
666,"00:43:17,636","00:43:21,139","Thank you. You look
pretty okay as well."
667,"00:43:21,724","00:43:23,224",Thank you. Earth tones.
668,"00:43:23,726","00:43:25,226",We need your insight.
669,"00:43:26,020","00:43:28,771",We are looking for a man...
670,"00:43:28,939","00:43:32,358",who's lost in the universe.
671,"00:43:32,943","00:43:34,235",My father.
672,"00:43:36,739","00:43:38,239",Dr. Murry.
673,"00:43:40,993","00:43:42,243",Handsome fellow.
674,"00:43:47,291","00:43:49,208","How am I supposed
to say no?"
675,"00:43:52,463","00:43:53,755",Okay.
676,"00:43:56,967","00:43:58,217",Center yourself.
677,"00:43:58,761","00:44:00,637","One foot up, please."
678,"00:44:01,221","00:44:02,055",Okay.
679,"00:44:02,890","00:44:05,475","Now, very little is up to moi."
680,"00:44:06,060","00:44:09,520","All right? Your energies
will affect what we see."
681,"00:44:09,688","00:44:13,066","So, core in, spine long..."
682,"00:44:13,359","00:44:15,652",shoulders down...
683,"00:44:17,279","00:44:18,279",buttocks taut.
684,"00:44:20,616","00:44:22,742",Close your eyes.
685,"00:44:23,160","00:44:24,202",You're kidding.
686,"00:44:25,120","00:44:26,621",Do I look like I'm kidding?
687,"00:44:26,789","00:44:27,872",Very much so.
688,"00:44:28,707","00:44:30,458","- A little.
- I'm not."
689,"00:44:32,711","00:44:34,295",I'm not.
690,"00:44:34,588","00:44:36,589","Let's try this again.
Now..."
691,"00:44:37,716","00:44:39,342",relax the face...
692,"00:44:40,427","00:44:42,470",close your eyes...
693,"00:44:42,638","00:44:44,722",and open your memories.
694,"00:44:45,307","00:44:47,225",Think about your father.
695,"00:44:51,105","00:44:51,813",No!
696,"00:44:51,980","00:44:54,148","I can't, I can't.
I'm sorry, I can't."
697,"00:44:58,112","00:44:59,404","I'm sorry, but..."
698,"00:44:59,571","00:45:02,615","I really just... I really
don't understand..."
699,"00:45:02,783","00:45:06,285","how thinking about him
is going to help us find him."
700,"00:45:06,787","00:45:09,122",All I do is think about him.
701,"00:45:10,290","00:45:11,499","I'm sorry, Mrs. Which,"
702,"00:45:11,583","00:45:13,710","but I think we need
to show her something."
703,"00:45:13,877","00:45:16,337","She needs to understand
what's possible."
704,"00:45:17,131","00:45:19,674","She needs to know
what's at stake."
705,"00:45:21,969","00:45:24,887","Close your eyes.
See with mine."
706,"00:45:28,434","00:45:29,434",This time...
707,"00:45:30,811","00:45:32,061",don't look away.
708,"00:45:44,658","00:45:46,784","The IT's home
may be Camazotz..."
709,"00:45:46,952","00:45:49,120","but through darkness,"
710,"00:45:49,204","00:45:52,248","The IT's reach
spreads far beyond."
711,"00:45:52,750","00:45:54,709",Even to your own planet.
712,"00:45:58,005","00:46:00,047","The only thing
in the universe..."
713,"00:46:00,215","00:46:03,801","that travels
faster than light..."
714,"00:46:03,969","00:46:04,969",is the darkness.
715,"00:46:06,680","00:46:09,223","The IT invades
the place inside of us"
716,"00:46:09,308","00:46:11,267",where hope and joy lives...
717,"00:46:11,435","00:46:12,769","We're happy to announce
the promotion"
718,"00:46:12,853","00:46:14,645","of one of our current
faculty members..."
719,"00:46:15,272","00:46:16,856",to be our new principal.
720,"00:46:17,024","00:46:18,524",That faculty member
721,"00:46:18,609","00:46:21,152","is three-time science teacher
of the year..."
722,"00:46:21,320","00:46:22,570",James Jenkins.
723,"00:46:22,738","00:46:25,156","Come on up, Principal Jenkins."
724,"00:46:27,493","00:46:29,744","replaces it
with jealousy..."
725,"00:46:40,297","00:46:41,672",and judgment...
726,"00:46:44,468","00:46:45,802",pain...
727,"00:46:48,722","00:46:50,223",and despair.
728,"00:46:50,390","00:46:51,933","What's up, Pops?"
729,"00:46:52,100","00:46:53,100",How you doing tonight?
730,"00:46:53,268","00:46:54,685","Hey, man, don't do that."
731,"00:46:55,437","00:46:57,939","- What you got up in here?
- What are you doing, man?"
732,"00:46:58,106","00:47:00,107","Man, do you know how I work
for this stuff?"
733,"00:47:00,275","00:47:01,776","Hey, man."
734,"00:47:05,322","00:47:06,572",84...
735,"00:47:06,740","00:47:08,032",82...
736,"00:47:08,200","00:47:09,492",82?
737,"00:47:09,660","00:47:12,662","I mean, are you even trying
or are you just an idiot?"
738,"00:47:12,830","00:47:15,456","Because if this is the best
you can do, it's pathetic!"
739,"00:47:15,624","00:47:17,750","You look at me
when I'm talking to you!"
740,"00:47:17,918","00:47:19,544",This is pathetic!
741,"00:47:23,924","00:47:26,425","You see?
This is what The IT does."
742,"00:47:28,595","00:47:32,932",One person at a time...
743,"00:47:33,976","00:47:36,227",until fear takes over.
744,"00:47:36,395","00:47:38,396",Fear turns to rage.
745,"00:47:40,732","00:47:43,776",And rage leads to violence.
746,"00:47:46,405","00:47:48,406","And then
there's a tipping point."
747,"00:47:49,867","00:47:51,450",If we do not act soon...
748,"00:47:51,994","00:47:55,162","darkness will fall
across the universe."
749,"00:47:56,081","00:47:57,582",We...
750,"00:47:57,749","00:48:02,837","we're in search of warriors
who can fight The IT..."
751,"00:48:04,131","00:48:08,175",and who can bring hope back.
752,"00:48:10,178","00:48:11,596",Your father.
753,"00:48:14,641","00:48:15,892",My father?
754,"00:48:25,360","00:48:27,528",Be a warrior.
755,"00:48:27,696","00:48:28,988",Can you?
756,"00:48:32,784","00:48:34,619",I'll try.
757,"00:48:35,662","00:48:38,623","Your father sounds
like a good man."
758,"00:48:39,791","00:48:41,042",How about we find him?
759,"00:48:42,544","00:48:44,295",Good. Okay.
760,"00:48:46,381","00:48:47,465","Good, good, good."
761,"00:48:47,633","00:48:48,841","Yeah.
Okay."
762,"00:48:49,426","00:48:50,593","Now, we're grounded.
We're centered, right?"
763,"00:48:50,761","00:48:52,428","- Okay, yeah.
- Okay."
764,"00:48:52,888","00:48:55,514",You can do this. Okay?
765,"00:48:56,266","00:48:58,351",You're choosing not to.
766,"00:49:07,444","00:49:09,695",But what if...
767,"00:49:11,156","00:49:13,407","What if he doesn't
wanna be found?"
768,"00:49:16,870","00:49:21,707","It's okay to fear
the answers, Meg."
769,"00:49:23,669","00:49:26,253",But you can't avoid them.
770,"00:49:27,798","00:49:29,465",Trust me.
771,"00:49:29,633","00:49:31,550","You don't wanna
end up like me,"
772,"00:49:31,635","00:49:34,095","a weirdo with a beard
living in a cave."
773,"00:49:39,685","00:49:42,478",Your father didn't forget you.
774,"00:49:45,941","00:49:47,817",You're too precious.
775,"00:49:50,862","00:49:52,613","All right, you ready?"
776,"00:49:52,698","00:49:54,407",Yeah.
777,"00:49:56,827","00:50:00,496",Center yourself. Where is he?
778,"00:50:03,750","00:50:05,084",Okay.
779,"00:50:06,044","00:50:08,170",Now we're getting a vision.
780,"00:50:11,591","00:50:12,591",Okay.
781,"00:50:26,106","00:50:28,357",Flower
782,"00:50:28,525","00:50:31,819",of the universe
783,"00:50:32,904","00:50:35,990",A child of mine
784,"00:50:47,961","00:50:48,961",Flower
785,"00:50:51,506","00:50:54,759",of the universe
786,"00:51:34,091","00:51:37,384","Love.
That's the frequency."
787,"00:51:43,558","00:51:45,434","That's it, Meg."
788,"00:51:46,103","00:51:48,395",He started in Uriel.
789,"00:51:48,730","00:51:51,482","Then he went to Ixchel.
Keep going, Meg."
790,"00:51:52,442","00:51:54,944",Oh! There's Aunt Beast!
791,"00:51:59,366","00:52:03,536","Oh, no,
he's going to Camazotz."
792,"00:52:04,204","00:52:05,287",No!
793,"00:52:05,455","00:52:07,456",No.
794,"00:52:40,407","00:52:41,991","I'm so sorry, Meg."
795,"00:52:42,159","00:52:44,368","The IT got to him
before we could."
796,"00:52:44,536","00:52:46,412","We thought he could
join the fight,"
797,"00:52:46,496","00:52:48,122","but now we need
to fight for him."
798,"00:52:51,168","00:52:54,920","So, how are we gonna
get my father off Camazotz?"
799,"00:52:56,423","00:53:00,426",We can't tesser to Camazotz.
800,"00:53:01,928","00:53:05,055","We can only tesser
where we find light..."
801,"00:53:06,057","00:53:08,058",for we are light.
802,"00:53:08,810","00:53:11,854",Camazotz is all darkness.
803,"00:53:12,606","00:53:16,275","This is no longer a search.
It's a rescue."
804,"00:53:17,235","00:53:20,613",We must go back to Earth...
805,"00:53:21,198","00:53:22,364",speak to your mother...
806,"00:53:23,950","00:53:25,618",regroup.
807,"00:53:26,244","00:53:30,497","No, no, no. I cannot leave
here without my father."
808,"00:53:30,665","00:53:33,459","It's for the best, Meg.
We have to make a plan."
809,"00:53:33,627","00:53:36,420","Please. Please!
I've come all this way."
810,"00:53:36,588","00:53:39,381","We're too close to finding
him to turn back!"
811,"00:53:39,799","00:53:41,967","""Planning is essential."""
812,"00:53:42,052","00:53:43,802","Churchill, British."
813,"00:53:47,724","00:53:50,726","No, no, no. Please!
He's running out of time."
814,"00:53:50,894","00:53:52,561","No, we cannot!"
815,"00:53:52,729","00:53:53,812",We have to save him.
816,"00:53:53,980","00:53:56,649","We can't give up.
There must be a way!"
817,"00:53:57,150","00:53:58,901","Don't leave him!
We can't!"
818,"00:53:59,069","00:53:59,902",Dad!
819,"00:54:11,539","00:54:13,290",Where are we?
820,"00:54:14,918","00:54:16,252",Where are the Misses?
821,"00:54:17,837","00:54:19,838",This place feels weird.
822,"00:54:24,678","00:54:26,553",Look! The Misses.
823,"00:54:41,820","00:54:42,820","Thank goodness
you made it."
824,"00:54:42,904","00:54:44,071",I was so worried.
825,"00:54:45,282","00:54:46,615","Are you okay,
are you hurt at all?"
826,"00:54:46,741","00:54:47,741",We're okay.
827,"00:54:49,077","00:54:52,788","Am I losing my senses or did
you just use your own words?"
828,"00:54:52,956","00:54:56,667","She's weakening.
As am I and Mrs. Whatsit."
829,"00:54:57,252","00:54:59,336","Wait, what's wrong?"
830,"00:54:59,504","00:55:00,963",Where... Where are we?
831,"00:55:02,257","00:55:03,674",Camazotz.
832,"00:55:05,051","00:55:08,095","Your will to find your father
took over our tesser..."
833,"00:55:08,513","00:55:10,764",and re-directed it from Earth.
834,"00:55:13,977","00:55:16,645",We must leave this planet.
835,"00:55:16,813","00:55:17,813","And we do not have
the strength"
836,"00:55:17,897","00:55:19,023",to take you with us.
837,"00:55:19,441","00:55:21,608","We can
barely tesser ourselves."
838,"00:55:22,360","00:55:24,737","You must continue on
without us."
839,"00:55:25,613","00:55:27,614",You must find your father.
840,"00:55:29,617","00:55:32,161","And know that
you're going to be tested"
841,"00:55:32,245","00:55:34,705",every step of the way.
842,"00:55:34,873","00:55:37,666","You'll encounter things
you think you know"
843,"00:55:37,751","00:55:39,001",but you don't.
844,"00:55:40,253","00:55:45,049","Here is the place
to be suspicious, okay?"
845,"00:55:48,803","00:55:49,803",We're fading.
846,"00:55:49,971","00:55:53,098","Can't we at least leave them
with something to help them?"
847,"00:55:53,266","00:55:55,476",Yes. Gifts.
848,"00:55:55,643","00:55:57,186",I love gifts.
849,"00:56:01,399","00:56:03,067","They work well
in a moment of peril..."
850,"00:56:04,819","00:56:08,113","for they see
that which is enfolded."
851,"00:56:09,032","00:56:12,659","Not gone, just enfolded."
852,"00:56:17,082","00:56:21,126","Meg. Trouble, problematic Meg."
853,"00:56:22,962","00:56:25,714","To you I give
the gift of your faults."
854,"00:56:28,051","00:56:30,260",You're welcome.
855,"00:56:30,428","00:56:33,472","You do know my faults
are the bad qualities, right?"
856,"00:56:34,182","00:56:36,016",Are they really?
857,"00:56:37,310","00:56:39,353","Well then, you're all set."
858,"00:56:39,521","00:56:43,148",My gift is my command.
859,"00:56:44,192","00:56:46,652",Stay together.
860,"00:56:47,612","00:56:50,072",Don't let anyone separate you.
861,"00:56:51,449","00:56:54,576","This is a planet
of many faces..."
862,"00:56:54,744","00:56:58,038","run by one cruel
and vicious mind."
863,"00:56:58,206","00:57:00,749","The IT desires
our strongest lights."
864,"00:57:01,251","00:57:03,085",Do not give in.
865,"00:57:03,753","00:57:05,421",We're going now.
866,"00:57:05,588","00:57:06,505",Be careful.
867,"00:57:07,424","00:57:09,425","""When shall we three
meet again?"
868,"00:57:09,509","00:57:11,927","""In thunder,
lightning or in rain?"""

870,"00:57:15,557","00:57:19,059","Keep going.
We'll be watching."
871,"00:57:30,238","00:57:31,905",What's happening?
872,"00:57:33,199","00:57:34,700","Wait. Where's
Charles Wallace?"
873,"00:57:35,201","00:57:36,243",He was just here!
874,"00:57:39,747","00:57:42,541",Charles Wallace!
875,"00:57:42,709","00:57:44,626","- Charles Wallace!
- Charles Wallace!"
876,"00:57:46,171","00:57:47,421",There's danger here.
877,"00:57:47,589","00:57:50,048",He's safe over the wall.
878,"00:57:50,216","00:57:51,633",Wait at the stream.
879,"00:57:57,891","00:57:59,308",Get to the wall.
880,"00:58:02,854","00:58:05,189",What is that?
881,"00:58:07,734","00:58:08,859",Get to the wall!
882,"00:58:09,027","00:58:10,027",Run!
883,"00:58:36,304","00:58:38,263",It's getting closer!
884,"00:58:38,431","00:58:39,890","Go, go, go! Faster!"
885,"00:58:47,524","00:58:48,941",There's the wall!
886,"00:58:53,738","00:58:55,656",We gotta get over the wall!
887,"00:59:07,585","00:59:08,585",Run faster!
888,"00:59:08,753","00:59:11,505","- Faster is not gonna help!
- Faster!"
889,"00:59:40,243","00:59:41,243",Calvin!
890,"00:59:41,953","00:59:43,412","Look, look!"
891,"00:59:44,163","00:59:46,498",See what it's doing?
892,"00:59:49,210","00:59:52,045","It's picking up stuff
and throwing it over!"
893,"00:59:56,968","01:00:00,596","Range is at fifty,
I don't know. Velocity..."
894,"01:00:00,763","01:00:02,347",We won't make it that way!
895,"01:00:02,807","01:00:05,142","No, Meg!
We have to keep going!"
896,"01:00:05,310","01:00:06,935",This is the only way!
897,"01:00:11,524","01:00:13,692",Do you trust me?
898,"01:00:14,319","01:00:15,777",I trust you!
899,"01:00:17,155","01:00:18,655",Okay.
900,"01:00:28,916","01:00:31,001","Run, Calvin, run!"
901,"01:01:30,019","01:01:32,729","How did you do
that whole thing with the log?"
902,"01:01:34,107","01:01:36,650",It's just a physics thing.
903,"01:01:36,818","01:01:37,693",The classic
904,"01:01:37,777","01:01:40,320",slingshot maneuver.
905,"01:01:41,781","01:01:43,740",Just a physics thing?
906,"01:01:45,451","01:01:48,245","You have no idea
how incredible you are..."
907,"01:01:49,789","01:01:51,206",do you?
908,"01:01:58,756","01:02:01,466","You're the one
who came with me."
909,"01:02:04,053","01:02:06,513","You didn't
have to do that."
910,"01:02:07,473","01:02:10,225","You're the one who
doesn't have to be here..."
911,"01:02:10,810","01:02:12,894",but you are.
912,"01:02:14,522","01:02:16,231",You're the one who's...
913,"01:02:27,285","01:02:29,494",I like your hair.
914,"01:02:33,666","01:02:35,500",Thank you.
915,"01:02:37,628","01:02:38,837",Meg! Calvin!
916,"01:02:40,006","01:02:43,425","You made it!
I couldn't see you!"
917,"01:02:44,343","01:02:46,219",I couldn't tell!
918,"01:02:46,804","01:02:50,182","I saw houses down there.
Come on!"
919,"01:02:56,147","01:02:57,606",Is Daddy down here?
920,"01:02:59,358","01:03:01,109",I hope so.
921,"01:03:19,462","01:03:21,421",I smell food.
922,"01:03:21,798","01:03:23,590","Like good, roasted food."
923,"01:03:26,761","01:03:28,845",Who else is starving?
924,"01:04:07,635","01:04:09,302",I can't stand the sound.
925,"01:04:14,225","01:04:17,394",The rhythm. It hurts.
926,"01:04:19,188","01:04:20,021",Come here.
927,"01:04:20,857","01:04:22,232",Cover your ears.
928,"01:04:35,997","01:04:38,456","Darling, time for dinner!"
929,"01:05:02,189","01:05:03,982","Are you lost, children?"
930,"01:05:05,735","01:05:09,696","I bet you're hungry,
and in need of comfort."
931,"01:05:12,867","01:05:14,409",I have roasts...
932,"01:05:14,577","01:05:17,621","and potatoes,
and cakes of all sorts."
933,"01:05:17,997","01:05:19,247",I could eat.
934,"01:05:22,877","01:05:24,002",No.
935,"01:05:24,629","01:05:25,962",Thanks. We're good.
936,"01:05:32,178","01:05:33,511","- No.
- Cakes of all sorts!"
937,"01:05:33,596","01:05:34,679",No!
938,"01:05:34,764","01:05:36,932","Trust no one, remember?"
939,"01:05:45,608","01:05:46,650",It's changing again.
940,"01:05:50,988","01:05:52,989",Is this still Camazotz?
941,"01:05:55,117","01:05:57,535","They said it was
a planet of many faces."
942,"01:06:30,403","01:06:33,446","Do you think this person would
mind if I ate all their food?"
943,"01:06:33,614","01:06:34,781",Probably.
944,"01:06:36,826","01:06:38,827",Hey! I'm right here!
945,"01:06:39,912","01:06:41,788",I'm right here!
946,"01:06:43,124","01:06:44,624",Hello!
947,"01:06:46,419","01:06:48,628",Hello! Friends!
948,"01:06:49,463","01:06:52,132","Hello, friends. Hey."
949,"01:06:52,299","01:06:53,883",How are you guys?
950,"01:06:54,051","01:06:55,260",Who are you?
951,"01:06:55,428","01:06:57,012","Oh, me? I'm nobody."
952,"01:06:57,179","01:07:01,016","But you can call me Red.
And you are...?"
953,"01:07:01,183","01:07:05,145","Oh, I'm Calvin. This is Meg.
And this is Charles Wallace."
954,"01:07:05,229","01:07:06,354",Oh!
955,"01:07:06,689","01:07:08,648","You're Alex Murry's kids,
aren't you?"
956,"01:07:12,361","01:07:13,653",You know my father?
957,"01:07:13,821","01:07:15,280","Yeah, yeah! I totally
know your father."
958,"01:07:15,448","01:07:17,073","He's a great guy. I just
saw him a couple minutes ago."
959,"01:07:18,075","01:07:19,075",Where?
960,"01:07:19,243","01:07:20,535","I mean, we've been
looking for him."
961,"01:07:20,619","01:07:21,745",Can you take us to him?
962,"01:07:21,912","01:07:23,288","Yeah. Yeah.
Well, no, no, no."
963,"01:07:23,456","01:07:25,331","Yeah. Almost. He should be
done working pretty soon."
964,"01:07:25,833","01:07:28,960","He's kind of a busy guy.
You know, bit of a workaholic."
965,"01:07:29,128","01:07:30,587","But I don't have
to tell you that. Right?"
966,"01:07:31,839","01:07:33,715","You know what?
Guys, sit down. Sit down."
967,"01:07:33,883","01:07:35,008","Relax.
There's nothing to do here."
968,"01:07:35,092","01:07:36,092",Nothing to worry about.
969,"01:07:36,927","01:07:38,553",Are you guys hungry?
970,"01:07:39,930","01:07:41,765",Everything's taken care of.
971,"01:07:41,932","01:07:45,226","In total. Without options
or alternatives."
972,"01:07:49,648","01:07:51,357",You guys hungry?
973,"01:07:51,525","01:07:53,401","Well, I'll brave it for us."
974,"01:08:04,663","01:08:06,372","What's wrong, little guy?"
975,"01:08:06,540","01:08:07,665",It tastes like...
976,"01:08:09,085","01:08:10,585",like sand.
977,"01:08:10,878","01:08:12,253",Does it?
978,"01:08:12,713","01:08:14,339",I don't taste any sand.
979,"01:08:15,257","01:08:16,508",Try mine.
980,"01:08:22,264","01:08:24,182",It's all sand!
981,"01:08:24,475","01:08:25,642",Ha!
982,"01:08:26,644","01:08:29,020","I thought you were like me,
Charles Wallace."
983,"01:08:29,647","01:08:31,773",I thought you were special.
984,"01:08:31,941","01:08:33,274",And you are.
985,"01:08:34,026","01:08:35,443",You passed the test.
986,"01:08:36,946","01:08:38,446",It's as simple as that.
987,"01:08:38,739","01:08:42,283","Simple as twice one is two.
Twice two is four."
988,"01:08:42,660","01:08:43,993",Twice three is six.
989,"01:08:45,121","01:08:46,663",Twice four is eight.
990,"01:08:46,831","01:08:48,623",Twice five is 10.
991,"01:08:48,791","01:08:50,542",Twice six is 12.
992,"01:08:50,709","01:08:52,085",Twice seven is 14.
993,"01:08:52,253","01:08:53,378",What are you doing?
994,"01:08:53,546","01:08:54,921",Twice eight is 16.
995,"01:08:55,089","01:08:57,382","We'd like to see
our father now."
996,"01:08:57,550","01:08:59,801","You got it.
I'll take you right to him."
997,"01:09:01,303","01:09:04,097","Charles Wallace.
Take my hand now."
998,"01:09:04,265","01:09:05,473",Please.
999,"01:09:06,642","01:09:08,059","No, thanks."
1000,"01:09:12,857","01:09:13,898","Oh, and, Meg..."
1001,"01:09:14,733","01:09:15,608",Hey.
1002,"01:09:17,987","01:09:19,654",Thanks for everything.
1003,"01:09:19,822","01:09:21,781",You brought him right to us.
1004,"01:09:28,289","01:09:29,455",No! Stop!
1005,"01:09:30,916","01:09:32,167",My little brother!
1006,"01:09:32,334","01:09:33,459","Charles Wallace!
Please!"
1007,"01:09:34,503","01:09:39,048",Charles Wallace!
1008,"01:09:39,216","01:09:40,258",Move!
1009,"01:09:41,844","01:09:42,760",Charles Wallace!
1010,"01:09:55,482","01:09:56,983","Well, that was fun."
1011,"01:09:57,151","01:09:59,444","Welcome to Central
Central Intelligence."
1012,"01:10:03,782","01:10:05,033",Get away from him!
1013,"01:10:07,036","01:10:09,370",Relax. Don't fight it.
1014,"01:10:09,538","01:10:11,372","It'll make it much easier,
I promise."
1015,"01:10:11,540","01:10:14,876","Please, Charles Wallace.
Please. He is dangerous."
1016,"01:10:15,044","01:10:16,044",What has he done to you?
1017,"01:10:16,212","01:10:17,170","Shut up, Meg!"
1018,"01:10:17,338","01:10:18,379","Yeah. Shut up, Meg."
1019,"01:10:18,923","01:10:22,175","Sorry, Red.
Meg's always been a problem."
1020,"01:10:22,343","01:10:23,927","She's quite an aberration,
you know."
1021,"01:10:24,094","01:10:25,386","Yeah, I can tell."
1022,"01:10:25,763","01:10:28,932","But aberrations
are far more interesting."
1023,"01:10:29,099","01:10:31,059","Don't you think,
Charles Wallace?"
1024,"01:10:32,353","01:10:34,938","That's so like you to try
to come to the rescue,"
1025,"01:10:35,022","01:10:36,022","isn't it, Calvin?"
1026,"01:10:37,358","01:10:40,318","Always so helpful.
Overly cheery."
1027,"01:10:40,402","01:10:41,611",Trying to please everyone.
1028,"01:10:42,071","01:10:43,696",Hoping to convince them...
1029,"01:10:43,864","01:10:47,033","that you're not just a burden
to your father and your world."
1030,"01:10:47,201","01:10:48,451",Pathetic.
1031,"01:10:53,916","01:10:55,750",That's not why I do it.
1032,"01:10:55,918","01:10:57,418","Of course, it is!"
1033,"01:10:57,586","01:10:59,545","Why else would you come
on this ridiculous"
1034,"01:10:59,630","01:11:01,547","journey with people
you barely know?"
1035,"01:11:01,715","01:11:03,758","Now that's enough,
Charles Wallace!"
1036,"01:11:03,842","01:11:04,842",You need to stop!
1037,"01:11:05,010","01:11:07,470","It's enough when The IT
says it's enough!"
1038,"01:11:09,014","01:11:11,266",Sit. I can take it from here.
1039,"01:11:11,433","01:11:13,351","No doubt about that,
little guy."
1040,"01:11:18,482","01:11:22,318","Would you like to meet The IT?
That happy sadist."
1041,"01:11:23,070","01:11:24,445",Not especially.
1042,"01:11:24,613","01:11:26,864",Watch your tone!
1043,"01:11:27,950","01:11:29,284",I'm sorry.
1044,"01:11:30,160","01:11:33,496","We're just here to see Dad.
Remember?"
1045,"01:11:33,664","01:11:35,206",Your dad.
1046,"01:11:35,374","01:11:37,875","Flower of the universe.
Child of mine."
1047,"01:11:38,919","01:11:40,086",No.
1048,"01:11:40,254","01:11:42,380",I think you mean your dad...
1049,"01:11:43,007","01:11:44,590",who left you...
1050,"01:11:44,758","01:11:48,052","who'd rather be anywhere else
in the universe than with you."
1051,"01:11:48,887","01:11:50,763","Why would you even
want to see him?"
1052,"01:11:53,892","01:11:54,892","Oh, well."
1053,"01:11:55,519","01:11:57,186","I wish I could
take you to him."
1054,"01:11:57,855","01:11:59,314",But I can't.
1055,"01:12:00,316","01:12:01,316",He's gone.
1056,"01:12:01,483","01:12:02,984",He's not gone.
1057,"01:12:05,404","01:12:06,237",You're right.
1058,"01:12:06,989","01:12:10,992","He's not gone.
And yet, I don't see him."
1059,"01:12:12,328","01:12:14,370","He's...
He's not gone."
1060,"01:12:23,756","01:12:25,423",He's not gone.
1061,"01:12:28,886","01:12:30,553",Just enfolded.
1062,"01:12:36,226","01:12:37,852",What is it?
1063,"01:12:42,024","01:12:43,649",What do you see?
1064,"01:12:46,362","01:12:48,237",Topological order.
1065,"01:12:49,073","01:12:51,574",Fractal dimension.
1066,"01:12:51,658","01:12:53,785",Ooh. Clever.
1067,"01:12:53,952","01:12:55,286",That she is.
1068,"01:13:05,547","01:13:06,631",Oh.
1069,"01:13:06,715","01:13:11,344","They come to see
the fire burning"
1070,"01:13:12,304","01:13:15,056",In your heart
1071,"01:13:18,936","01:13:20,645",They want to witness
1072,"01:13:23,607","01:13:29,529",This love from the start
1073,"01:13:36,620","01:13:40,623","They hear you
when you cry"
1074,"01:13:43,794","01:13:47,547",This love is far and wide
1075,"01:13:50,926","01:13:54,220","When you smile,
the stars align"
1076,"01:13:56,473","01:14:02,228",Flower of the universe
1077,"01:14:02,729","01:14:06,190",Child of mine
1078,"01:14:07,526","01:14:10,111",Ooh
1079,"01:14:54,865","01:14:55,990",Meg.
1080,"01:14:59,703","01:15:01,829","- Meg.
- Dad, it's..."
1081,"01:15:06,585","01:15:08,127","- Dad.
- Meg."
1082,"01:15:20,516","01:15:21,659",Dad.
1083,"01:15:33,612","01:15:36,906",Is this a trick? A dream?
1084,"01:15:37,366","01:15:39,742","It's me, Dad. It's me."
1085,"01:15:42,162","01:15:44,038",I missed you so much.
1086,"01:15:44,665","01:15:46,707",My beautiful Meg.
1087,"01:15:46,875","01:15:49,710","I missed you
every second of every day."
1088,"01:15:52,589","01:15:54,173",Let me look at you.
1089,"01:15:56,134","01:15:57,593",Daddy.
1090,"01:15:58,136","01:15:59,428","Hi, Dad."
1091,"01:16:07,104","01:16:09,605","How long
have I been gone, baby?"
1092,"01:16:14,069","01:16:15,778",How long have I been gone?
1093,"01:16:22,160","01:16:23,536",Four years.
1094,"01:16:25,789","01:16:27,873",You left four years ago.
1095,"01:16:29,668","01:16:30,668",No.
1096,"01:16:31,837","01:16:35,131",No. No. No.
1097,"01:16:35,299","01:16:37,508","No, that can't be. No."
1098,"01:16:38,218","01:16:39,927",No. I didn't.
1099,"01:16:40,554","01:16:43,306","No, I didn't leave you, baby.
I wouldn't."
1100,"01:16:43,473","01:16:45,516","I would never leave you,
sweetheart."
1101,"01:16:46,226","01:16:48,894",I've been trapped here.
1102,"01:16:49,354","01:16:50,688",How did you get here?
1103,"01:16:50,856","01:16:51,939","It's dangerous here, Meglet."
1104,"01:16:52,024","01:16:53,733","You can't be here.
How did you get here?"
1105,"01:16:53,900","01:16:56,485","You called out for us.
We came for you."
1106,"01:16:58,363","01:17:00,489","We're here
to bring you home, Dad."
1107,"01:17:03,118","01:17:04,201","""We""?"
1108,"01:17:04,369","01:17:06,078",My friend Calvin and...
1109,"01:17:06,705","01:17:08,831",Charles Wallace came with me.
1110,"01:17:11,710","01:17:15,087","Charles Wallace.
My baby boy is here?"
1111,"01:17:15,255","01:17:16,255",Where is he?
1112,"01:17:16,423","01:17:17,757",Is he okay?
1113,"01:17:21,261","01:17:23,471","The IT has done
something to him."
1114,"01:17:35,692","01:17:37,234",Charles Wallace.
1115,"01:17:38,945","01:17:40,404","Is that you, son?"
1116,"01:17:40,572","01:17:41,489",Son?
1117,"01:17:41,948","01:17:43,616",Depends on who you ask.
1118,"01:17:46,536","01:17:47,912",Let me get a good look at you.
1119,"01:17:52,042","01:17:53,209","You all right?
Yeah."
1120,"01:17:54,503","01:17:55,753",Charles Wallace.
1121,"01:17:55,921","01:17:57,672","You don't look like
how I pictured you."
1122,"01:17:58,882","01:18:00,257",I'm underwhelmed.
1123,"01:18:00,425","01:18:02,343",Charles Wallace.
1124,"01:18:04,054","01:18:05,137",Hey.
1125,"01:18:05,972","01:18:07,640",What has The IT done to you?
1126,"01:18:08,225","01:18:10,393","The IT has shown me
my potential."
1127,"01:18:11,603","01:18:14,063","I can see the weaknesses
of any soul."
1128,"01:18:14,231","01:18:15,856","Like, take your soul."
1129,"01:18:16,024","01:18:19,151","So desperate
to matter in the universe..."
1130,"01:18:20,946","01:18:23,948","you'd abandon your own family
and never look back."
1131,"01:18:30,539","01:18:32,498","That's not true, I swear."
1132,"01:18:33,542","01:18:34,542",Doesn't matter.
1133,"01:18:35,836","01:18:37,169",Let's go meet The IT.
1134,"01:18:37,713","01:18:40,631","- No. No.
Yes, yes."
1135,"01:18:41,758","01:18:42,591","Come on, now."
1136,"01:18:42,759","01:18:44,593",Don't make me drag you.
1137,"01:18:47,639","01:18:49,682","Okay. How about
you just take me?"
1138,"01:18:49,850","01:18:50,683",No.
1139,"01:18:50,851","01:18:52,852","- Meg. Meg. Take me.
Dad, no. No!"
1140,"01:18:53,019","01:18:53,728",No.
1141,"01:18:53,895","01:18:55,438","I have
to do this, sweetheart."
1142,"01:18:55,605","01:18:56,772",We don't want you!
1143,"01:18:56,857","01:18:58,107",We've already had you!
1144,"01:19:09,119","01:19:10,077",Stop it!
1145,"01:19:11,371","01:19:12,204",Grab onto it!
1146,"01:19:14,416","01:19:15,458",Let us go!
1147,"01:19:15,625","01:19:20,004","Stop clawing the walls.
The IT's waiting for you."
1148,"01:19:20,172","01:19:21,255",You're hurting them!
1149,"01:19:21,339","01:19:22,631","And you're just
being impolite!"
1150,"01:19:23,008","01:19:24,008",Stop!
1151,"01:19:25,469","01:19:26,469",Stop! Please!
1152,"01:19:28,138","01:19:29,138","Don't do this, please!"
1153,"01:19:30,974","01:19:32,892","Please, don't do this!"
1154,"01:19:33,059","01:19:35,686","This is all your fault,
Mr. Murry!"
1155,"01:19:37,105","01:19:38,522","Can you
hear me? Meg!"
1156,"01:19:38,690","01:19:39,857",Meg!
1157,"01:19:40,025","01:19:41,066","Meg, wake up, baby!"
1158,"01:19:41,234","01:19:42,234","Resist. Resist, Meg."
1159,"01:19:42,402","01:19:44,528","Don't give in to the darkness.
Don't give in! Meglet..."
1160,"01:19:44,696","01:19:45,863","Meglet, wake up."
1161,"01:19:46,031","01:19:47,615",Wake up! Wake up! Meg!
1162,"01:19:47,783","01:19:48,783",Meg! Wake up!
1163,"01:19:49,701","01:19:50,701",Come on. Hold on.
1164,"01:19:50,869","01:19:52,453","Hold on, come on. Hold on!"
1165,"01:19:52,621","01:19:53,579",Breathe.
1166,"01:19:53,747","01:19:55,247","Breathe, Meg, breathe!"
1167,"01:19:55,415","01:19:57,124",Let her go. Let her give in.
1168,"01:19:57,292","01:19:58,751",Give up.
1169,"01:19:58,919","01:20:02,755","This is what you get when you
put yourself before family!"
1170,"01:20:03,757","01:20:07,968","Please. Charles Wallace,
I'll do anything you want."
1171,"01:20:09,429","01:20:12,306","Charles Wallace
isn't here right now."
1172,"01:20:13,725","01:20:15,434",And even if he were...
1173,"01:20:16,311","01:20:18,604",you're powerless against us.
1174,"01:20:18,772","01:20:21,232",You have nothing that we want.
1175,"01:20:21,858","01:20:24,276",Except for her.
1176,"01:20:24,444","01:20:25,277",No.

1225,"01:23:51,568","01:23:53,444","Extraordinary,
don't you think?"
1226,"01:23:54,821","01:23:56,697",That's one word for it.
1227,"01:23:57,741","01:23:59,908","We could really use
a gal like you."
1228,"01:24:00,493","01:24:02,411","So, what do you say?"
1229,"01:24:04,039","01:24:05,330",You wanna join us?

1231,"01:24:30,482","01:24:32,399","Take a good look
at her."
1232,"01:24:32,484","01:24:34,485","She's a better version
of you."
1233,"01:24:36,321","01:24:39,114","She's sure to be popular.
Great student."
1234,"01:24:39,282","01:24:41,909","Principal Jenkins
is going to love her."
1235,"01:24:42,577","01:24:45,120","And Calvin probably will, too."
1236,"01:24:46,206","01:24:47,873","She doesn't just have to
live in your imagination..."
1237,"01:24:48,041","01:24:50,125",I can make her real.
1238,"01:24:52,378","01:24:54,004","You said
you wanted to come back"
1239,"01:24:54,089","01:24:55,214",as someone else.
1240,"01:24:56,007","01:24:58,008","Join us, and I can make you
just like her."

what you did to her."
1245,"01:25:17,779","01:25:20,239","We don't care
whose sister you are!"
1246,"01:25:26,955","01:25:28,330","We're your only option,"
1247,"01:25:28,414","01:25:30,624","and we're starting
to not want you!"
1248,"01:25:30,875","01:25:32,960","A feeling you're very
used to, actually."
1249,"01:25:33,336","01:25:35,879",No one in school likes you.
1250,"01:25:36,047","01:25:39,800","Your father left you
without so much as a goodbye."
1251,"01:25:39,968","01:25:43,428","Every bad thing you think
about yourself is true."

the gift of your faults."
1257,"01:26:01,447","01:26:03,615",I know my faults.

- Don't you, Charles Wallace?"
1267,"01:26:34,647","01:26:36,356","- No!
- Shut up!"
1268,"01:26:39,152","01:26:40,402",It's okay.

1272,"01:26:47,160","01:26:49,745","It's an empty,
meaningless word."
1273,"01:26:50,038","01:26:52,289","You can hurt me
when I say I love you,"
1274,"01:26:52,373","01:26:53,582",but I'll love you anyway!

on me during recess."
1278,"01:27:07,931","01:27:11,308","That's why you wanted to
find Daddy, to make me happy!"

took a chance on me."
1280,"01:27:16,522","01:27:18,273",Because they felt your love.
1281,"01:27:19,859","01:27:23,070","And you should love me
