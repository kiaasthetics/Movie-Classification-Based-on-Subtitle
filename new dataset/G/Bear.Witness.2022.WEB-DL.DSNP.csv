will pop up that hole,"

little last piece of fast ice"
703,"00:59:22,267","00:59:24,852","in one of the northern fjords
that we were hoping for."
704,"00:59:24,936","00:59:27,730","We know that the ice
will be better further in the fjord,"
705,"00:59:27,814","00:59:30,233","but we also need to find a family,
we need to find"
706,"00:59:30,316","00:59:33,653","a family with two cubs here.
Otherwise there's no point being here."
707,"00:59:36,155","00:59:38,741",Time to break out the snowmobiles
708,"00:59:39,867","00:59:42,495","while Oskar checks
the thickness of the ice."
709,"00:59:44,497","00:59:47,083","STROM: We might break through
this first layer of water,"

-MAN: Yeah."
711,"00:59:49,961","00:59:54,132","So there is a lot to think about
when we're out on this summer ice."
712,"00:59:54,215","00:59:56,509","First of all, the ice is not consistent."
713,"00:59:56,593","01:00:00,930","Some places the ice is 60 centimeters,
sometimes the ice is 20 centimeters,"
714,"01:00:01,014","01:00:02,807",some areas is only 10 centimeters.
715,"01:00:03,016","01:00:05,059",And the air temperature is plus degrees.
716,"01:00:05,435","01:00:09,397","So with these strong winds,
it's like putting a hairdryer to the ice."
717,"01:00:09,480","01:00:12,984","The changes on this summer ice
is happening so rapidly."
718,"01:00:13,067","01:00:15,403","If something happens to us
when we're out here,"
719,"01:00:15,486","01:00:17,488","there is nothing
they can do from the ship."
720,"01:00:17,572","01:00:20,617","The ship can't break the ice in here
and come to our rescue."
721,"01:00:20,700","01:00:24,037","We have to be able to get back to the ship
by our own means."

the team knows"
723,"01:00:34,839","01:00:39,886","this is one of the last patches of sea ice
where they can use their snowmobiles."
724,"01:00:54,233","01:00:58,738","STEINMANN: We always look in front of
the glaciers for the bear families."
725,"01:00:59,364","01:01:03,201","But on the maps,
the glacier should be right here,"
726,"01:01:03,576","01:01:06,496","and it's one or two kilometers
in the distance already."
727,"01:01:06,579","01:01:08,790",So it's just...
728,"01:01:08,873","01:01:12,919","Yeah, it's pretty obvious
how fast the glaciers are receding here."
729,"01:01:19,133","01:01:20,927","Hey, over there, Rolf, look."
730,"01:01:21,010","01:01:22,512",There's like two yellow things.
731,"01:01:22,845","01:01:24,597","-Yes.
-One is bigger, one is smaller."
732,"01:01:30,687","01:01:34,273","NARRATOR: Finally,
a family with cubs of the year."
733,"01:01:36,150","01:01:37,443",STEINMANN: We found the family.
734,"01:01:38,444","01:01:42,490","Family's up there in the moraine.
It's the tiny cubs from this winter,"
735,"01:01:42,615","01:01:45,284",and we are actually really excited
736,"01:01:45,368","01:01:49,163","that we have the chance now
to work with them."
737,"01:01:49,247","01:01:51,666","Normally, these families
are very skittish,"
738,"01:01:51,749","01:01:55,795",so we will have to be very patient now.
739,"01:02:00,049","01:02:05,221","It's the most difficult thing
to film a mom with COYs."
740,"01:02:06,681","01:02:09,392","There's no place to hide on the ice
from a polar bear mom,"

the shots they've all worked so hard for,"

It's coming fast."

that our family's out there,"

750,"01:03:00,026","01:03:01,903","And when the fog comes, it's not good,"
751,"01:03:01,986","01:03:04,489","because then we can't see
the holes in the ice."
752,"01:03:07,617","01:03:10,995","NARRATOR: They have no choice
but to head back to the boat"

all this water is making the ice rot,"

not safe to be out on the ice anymore."

the tender, being lower to the ocean"

773,"01:04:54,932","01:04:56,559",And off we go.

when you have a whale carcass"
855,"01:12:19,084","01:12:21,503","is that because they're so well-fed,"

to keep searching for their food,"

six or seven hours a day."
876,"01:13:59,017","01:14:02,646","NARRATOR: Even more bears arrive,
keen to join in."
877,"01:14:03,355","01:14:06,775","STROM: (WHISPERING) These two guys
just came straight up to our two cubs."
878,"01:14:08,652","01:14:10,279",They don't seem hostile.
879,"01:14:10,988","01:14:14,491","So we might see that
they start playing with each other."
880,"01:14:14,825","01:14:17,035",Here we go.
881,"01:14:24,251","01:14:27,671","Unbelievably, they've decided
to hook up and play"
882,"01:14:27,754","01:14:29,965",with the other two pairs of cubs.
883,"01:14:34,636","01:14:38,390","I've never seen anything like this before,
up close."
884,"01:14:38,474","01:14:41,894","There's four bears
that are super relaxed with us."
885,"01:14:47,149","01:14:50,360","This is super cool, it's very unusual."
886,"01:14:56,950","01:14:58,619",Yeah!
887,"01:14:58,702","01:15:02,623","NARRATOR: Capturing such a unique moment
is a high point for the crew."
888,"01:15:02,706","01:15:06,126","But with the story of young cubs
still incomplete,"
889,"01:15:06,210","01:15:08,795",they're desperate for one more chance.
890,"01:15:10,422","01:15:12,883","WILSON: We've got sun and we've got seals,"
891,"01:15:12,966","01:15:18,096","but that elusive mother and cubs, though,
still no sign."
892,"01:15:19,264","01:15:23,560","NARRATOR: Finally, all their resilience
and hard work pay off."
893,"01:15:25,229","01:15:29,274","The crew spots a mother
with a cub born this year."
894,"01:15:31,777","01:15:33,779","NARRATOR: They immediately
launch the tender,"
895,"01:15:34,071","01:15:36,532",hoping this is their moment.
896,"01:15:42,204","01:15:45,332","(ON RADIO) Am I heading straight for it,
or is it on our starboard side?"
897,"01:15:46,917","01:15:50,003","FORMAN: It's on your starboard side.
STROM: Perfect. Thank you."
898,"01:16:03,225","01:16:06,353","STROM: We've been trying to find a family
with cubs of the year,"
899,"01:16:06,645","01:16:09,565","and we've been trying to find them
with snowmobiles,"
900,"01:16:09,731","01:16:13,193","we've been out scouting 24 hours,
we have been unlucky with fog,"
901,"01:16:13,277","01:16:16,238","we have been unlucky
with too much wind, storms, everything."
902,"01:16:16,697","01:16:18,282","Today, everything comes together,"
903,"01:16:18,365","01:16:20,951","and we found a family
with one cub of the year."
904,"01:16:21,034","01:16:23,870","We just spent about two hours with her
in beautiful light,"
905,"01:16:23,954","01:16:26,623","in beautiful ice, perfect conditions."
906,"01:16:26,707","01:16:29,710","And that's just the way
wildlife filming works, you know?"
907,"01:16:30,002","01:16:31,920","You have a lot of things against you,"
908,"01:16:32,004","01:16:34,590","and, one day, everything
just happens to come together."
909,"01:16:35,340","01:16:39,553","NARRATOR: It's a perfect end to filming
for the Disneynature team."
910,"01:16:44,891","01:16:50,564","STEINMANN: The experience of filming
the bears have changed my life,"
911,"01:16:50,814","01:16:54,234","and they have changed my life
to the better."
912,"01:16:55,527","01:17:01,491","What is so magical about it is you get
the opportunity at this day and age"
913,"01:17:01,575","01:17:04,411","to capture something that
people have never seen before."
914,"01:17:20,677","01:17:24,931","NARRATOR: But having seen and experienced
Svalbard's changes,"
915,"01:17:25,015","01:17:30,145","it's impossible not to wonder what
the future holds for this young family."
916,"01:17:31,355","01:17:34,107","SOKGSETH: My biggest concern
for Arctic species,"
917,"01:17:34,232","01:17:36,902","in the future, in Svalbard,"
918,"01:17:36,985","01:17:42,532","is that they will not manage to adapt
fast enough to the climate changes,"
919,"01:17:42,616","01:17:44,201",which are very rapid.
920,"01:17:48,622","01:17:51,625","STEINMANN: When you see this,
you really ask yourself,"
921,"01:17:51,708","01:17:58,173","""How can we allow this to happen,
that we lose this indescribable beauty?"""
922,"01:18:04,888","01:18:08,141","If there is a time coming
where these bears"
923,"01:18:08,225","01:18:13,188","don't roam the Arctic anymore,
I think we lose so much."
924,"01:18:18,193","01:18:22,823","All it needs now is a commitment,
and we can turn it around."
925,"01:18:24,366","01:18:27,661","And the time for that commitment
is right now."
