58,"00:06:17,811","00:06:19,711","Is this your, uh..."
59,"00:06:19,713","00:06:23,081","I feel like this would be
your shoulder, or..."
60,"00:06:23,083","00:06:24,616",Whoops.
61,"00:06:24,618","00:06:28,520","Oh, please come out.

63,"00:06:30,791","00:06:35,026","the sky and, oh, the ground."
64,"00:06:36,397","00:06:38,630",OK.
65,"00:06:38,632","00:06:40,866","Can't stay in this fruticumque
viret forever, I suppose."
66,"00:06:40,868","00:06:42,968",As much as I'd like to.
67,"00:06:51,078","00:06:53,812",Told you you'd freak out.
68,"00:06:54,982","00:06:56,982",What?

71,"00:07:13,200","00:07:16,468","Is it because you're, like,
really super freaky?"
72,"00:07:16,470","00:07:18,437",What did I say?
73,"00:07:18,439","00:07:21,006","- Is it, though?
- No. It's just..."
74,"00:07:21,008","00:07:23,542","Have you heard of
the word ""alien""?"
75,"00:07:23,544","00:07:27,012","We hadn't heard any words
until, like, five minutes ago."
76,"00:07:27,648","00:07:29,647","Well, you see,"
77,"00:07:29,649","00:07:31,649","- I come from very far away.
- The sky?"
78,"00:07:31,652","00:07:35,754","- All I want is to go home.
- Oh, that's easy!"
79,"00:07:35,756","00:07:38,190","What? Hey, no!"
80,"00:07:48,635","00:07:52,537","- What did you do that for?
- You said you wanted to go home."
81,"00:07:52,539","00:07:56,041","Yeah. OK. It takes
a lot more than that"
82,"00:07:56,043","00:07:59,511","- to exit the Earth's atmosphere.
- Gotcha!"
83,"00:07:59,513","00:08:02,147","- I have the regret...
- No."
84,"00:08:04,017","00:08:09,521","- He seemed nice.
- I wonder what he..."
85,"00:08:09,523","00:08:12,557",What's tha...
86,"00:08:17,130","00:08:20,799","Um, look,
I don't mean to cause a fuss."
87,"00:08:20,801","00:08:23,268","- Would you mind not doing that?
- Sorry."
88,"00:08:23,270","00:08:27,072","Hey, we can talk again.
You're making us talk!"
89,"00:08:27,074","00:08:30,208","It's not me. Hang on, just...
Where's that...?"
90,"00:08:30,210","00:08:32,544","Ah, there we go."
91,"00:08:32,546","00:08:34,746","If you're anywhere near this,
then..."
92,"00:08:34,748","00:08:37,215","- What is that?
- It's a speech pod."
93,"00:08:37,217","00:08:39,618","Oh, I love peaches!"
94,"00:08:39,620","00:08:41,753",Not peach.
95,"00:08:41,755","00:08:44,022",Ssp-p-p... speech.
96,"00:08:44,024","00:08:47,959","- This makes us talk?
- Yes."
97,"00:08:47,961","00:08:51,029","- Could I have...?
- This is amazing!"
98,"00:08:51,031","00:08:53,164","- That's my favourite word.
- Nice."
99,"00:08:53,166","00:08:57,269",The others have got to try this!
100,"00:08:57,871","00:09:00,739","Oh, boy."
101,"00:09:06,146","00:09:10,315","Just wait
till I get my paws on you."
102,"00:09:10,317","00:09:12,751",You'll wish you'd never ripened!
103,"00:09:12,753","00:09:14,085",Huh?
104,"00:09:14,087","00:09:16,121",Get off my lawn! Get off!
105,"00:09:16,123","00:09:20,025","Off, off, off, off, off, off,
off, off, off, off!"
106,"00:09:20,027","00:09:23,562",Huh!
107,"00:09:23,564","00:09:24,963","And, you! Get off my back,"
108,"00:09:24,965","00:09:29,267","you yellow-bellied
delicious tropical tormentor!"
109,"00:09:29,269","00:09:31,336",Who's there?
110,"00:09:31,338","00:09:33,705","- Egg.
- Egg who?"
111,"00:09:33,707","00:09:37,309","No. Just Egg. Why?
Is there other stuff out there"
112,"00:09:37,311","00:09:40,579","- I don't know about?
- Who knows?"
113,"00:09:40,581","00:09:44,749","- I want out!
- Uh-uh-uh. Not yet, dears."
114,"00:09:44,751","00:09:47,319",Too soon for you.
115,"00:09:47,321","00:09:51,323","Ball. Ball, ball, ball, ball,
ball, ball, ball."
116,"00:09:51,325","00:09:56,261","Ball, ball, ball, ball, ball."
117,"00:09:56,263","00:09:59,631",Huh? Ball?
118,"00:10:03,637","00:10:08,073",Come on.
119,"00:10:08,075","00:10:11,109",Say something. Just a word.
120,"00:10:13,714","00:10:15,313",Huh?
121,"00:10:15,315","00:10:19,651","- Huh?

122,"00:10:19,653","00:10:21,119",Hey?
123,"00:10:21,121","00:10:25,223","Oh, coming. I'm coming."
124,"00:10:27,394","00:10:30,027",I'm sorry.
125,"00:10:30,029","00:10:32,663","No, that's quite all right.
I'm used to this sort of thing."
126,"00:10:37,170","00:10:38,670",Huh?!
127,"00:10:40,674","00:10:42,707","Hey, who are you? What are you?"
128,"00:10:42,709","00:10:45,310","What are you doing here?
You're a newcomer."
129,"00:10:45,312","00:10:47,312","- Do you know the rules?
- Rules?"
130,"00:10:47,314","00:10:51,383","When you're in this jungle,
you need to know the rules."
131,"00:10:51,385","00:10:54,252",Rule 1: stay off my lawn!
132,"00:10:54,254","00:10:56,988","Rule 3: don't ever, ever..."
133,"00:10:56,990","00:10:59,057",What happened to rule 2?
134,"00:10:59,059","00:11:00,291",...ever correct me!
135,"00:11:00,293","00:11:03,795","Rule 4: I'm right, you're wrong.
Rule next..."
136,"00:11:03,797","00:11:07,198","You don't need to tell me this.
I'm trying to go home."
137,"00:11:07,200","00:11:09,934","- Huh?
- He's from the sky."
138,"00:11:09,936","00:11:12,737","Well, no...
a bit further than that."
139,"00:11:12,739","00:11:17,208","I come from...
Please don't throw me again."
140,"00:11:17,210","00:11:19,811","I come from a planet
called Scaldron."
141,"00:11:19,813","00:11:23,181","It's another world
far beyond the stars."
142,"00:11:26,853","00:11:29,187",Oooh!
143,"00:11:29,189","00:11:31,522",Ooh.
144,"00:11:31,524","00:11:33,858","But I'm not allowed to go back
until I complete my mission."
145,"00:11:33,860","00:11:38,730","A mission! That sounds
A to the may to the zing!"
146,"00:11:38,732","00:11:41,800","Favourite word. I'm allowed
to do stuff like that to it."
147,"00:11:41,802","00:11:44,169",What's your mission?
148,"00:11:47,074","00:11:48,907",I'd rather not talk about it.
149,"00:11:48,909","00:11:50,942","- But we can help!
- Yeah."
150,"00:11:50,944","00:11:54,813","Wait a minute, wait a minute.
I'm not helping anyone"
151,"00:11:54,815","00:11:57,115","unless there's something
in it for me."
152,"00:11:57,117","00:11:59,384","Honestly,
you don't have to help."
153,"00:11:59,386","00:12:02,487","Ah, no, no, no. Nice try."
154,"00:12:02,489","00:12:04,122",You can't leave me out of this!
155,"00:12:04,124","00:12:06,458",I'm helping and that's final!
156,"00:12:06,460","00:12:08,827","It's something
I have to do myself."
157,"00:12:08,829","00:12:13,431","So, if it's all the same to you,
I'd really rather be alone."
158,"00:12:38,759","00:12:43,294","You're still there, aren't you?"
159,"00:12:43,296","00:12:46,030","You look like
you could use some company."
160,"00:12:46,032","00:12:47,899","It's very lonely, being alone."
161,"00:12:47,901","00:12:50,001","We'll stay with you
until you feel better."
162,"00:12:50,003","00:12:52,537","I don't need help.
I'm a Scaldronian."
163,"00:12:52,539","00:12:55,240","- Scaldronians don't need help!
- Loud words!"
164,"00:12:55,242","00:12:58,510","- That's upsetting me.
- Sorry, I didn't mean to shout."
165,"00:12:58,512","00:13:00,378","Don't worry, he's always upset."
166,"00:13:00,380","00:13:03,548","I am always upset!
Don't you say I am."
167,"00:13:03,550","00:13:05,116","- What?
- You see?"
168,"00:13:05,118","00:13:07,919","- I have no idea what you mean.
- Exactly!"
169,"00:13:07,921","00:13:12,323","What I mean to say is
it's very kind, thank you,"
170,"00:13:12,325","00:13:14,025","but you can't help me,"
171,"00:13:14,027","00:13:18,129","and you wouldn't even like it
if you did."
172,"00:13:18,131","00:13:20,498","But if you don't complete
your mission..."
173,"00:13:20,500","00:13:22,433",You can't go home.
174,"00:13:22,435","00:13:25,336","And if you can't go home,
you won't..."
175,"00:13:25,338","00:13:28,339",See your family.
176,"00:13:30,310","00:13:35,246",Poor alien.
177,"00:13:35,248","00:13:38,983",Can't go back home.
178,"00:13:45,492","00:13:50,094","Oh, come now.
There, there. Chin up."
179,"00:13:50,096","00:13:54,465","But you can't go home,
and it's so far away."
180,"00:13:54,467","00:13:59,470","And we can't help you.
And what about your friends?"
181,"00:13:59,472","00:14:02,540","- Oh, that's not a problem.
- Huh?"
182,"00:14:02,542","00:14:08,279",I don't have any friends.
183,"00:14:08,281","00:14:12,150","Look, it's not...
Oh, boy. Please don't cry."
184,"00:14:12,152","00:14:14,853","OK, fine."
185,"00:14:14,855","00:14:20,058",I'll do it. I'll give it a go.
186,"00:14:20,060","00:14:23,027","- Your mission?
- Yep. Why not?"
187,"00:14:23,029","00:14:25,463","If it'll stop all the,
you know..."
188,"00:14:25,465","00:14:27,198",...stuff.
189,"00:14:27,200","00:14:29,167",Yes!
190,"00:14:29,169","00:14:33,538","OK. Well, I guess this is it,
then. The, um, moment."
191,"00:14:39,579","00:14:42,881",I...
192,"00:14:45,218","00:14:49,921","Uh, hang on. Hold on a sec.
Let me just, uh..."
193,"00:14:54,361","00:14:58,196","Yeah, that makes sense, yeah."
194,"00:14:58,198","00:15:00,598",OK. Yeah.
195,"00:15:06,072","00:15:08,606","Hm...
OK then, sorry about that."
196,"00:15:08,608","00:15:11,309","Uh...
I claim this planet"
197,"00:15:11,311","00:15:14,379","in the name
of the mighty people of..."
198,"00:15:14,381","00:15:18,216","- Hey!
- Mmm."
199,"00:15:20,387","00:15:22,086","Oh, great."
200,"00:15:22,088","00:15:25,456",Freedom!
201,"00:15:25,458","00:15:29,027","Look out, coming through!
Terribly sorry."
202,"00:15:29,029","00:15:32,297","- Come back here, young lady.
- Ah, man."
203,"00:15:34,534","00:15:37,135","- Carry on.
- Yeah, go on."
204,"00:15:37,137","00:15:39,037",But... he took my...
205,"00:15:39,039","00:15:42,507","Don't worry about that.
You can do it. Right, guys?"
206,"00:15:42,509","00:15:45,576","You can do anything
you set your mind to."
207,"00:15:45,578","00:15:49,414","- I set my mind to freedom.
- Not you."
208,"00:15:49,416","00:15:53,017","- Oh.
- Uh-oh."
209,"00:15:53,019","00:15:56,054",Uh... Um... Uh...
210,"00:15:56,056","00:15:59,657",I claim this planet...
211,"00:15:59,659","00:16:03,127","...in the name of the mighty
people of Scaldron!"
212,"00:16:03,129","00:16:06,230","Surrender peacefully
or meet the wrath..."
213,"00:16:06,232","00:16:08,715","Is it wrath, wrath...?"
214,"00:16:08,717","00:16:11,201","...the wrath of the mighty
people of Scaldron!"
215,"00:16:11,204","00:16:13,438","Uh, that's...
that's a bit repetitive."
216,"00:16:13,440","00:16:16,374","Should probably rewrite that.
And, uh..."
217,"00:16:16,376","00:16:21,012","Um, there, there you have it.
That's my big, uh..."
218,"00:16:21,014","00:16:22,380",The end.
219,"00:16:24,217","00:16:28,119","- We surrender peacefully!
- You... You do?"
220,"00:16:28,121","00:16:30,021",Wait just one second.
221,"00:16:30,023","00:16:32,991","I for one
do not surrender peacefully."
222,"00:16:32,993","00:16:36,694","- You really don't have to...
- I surrender peacefully."
223,"00:16:36,696","00:16:38,296","- You did it!
- I did?"
224,"00:16:38,298","00:16:42,433","Yeah, well done!"
225,"00:16:42,435","00:16:44,785",Whoopee.
226,"00:16:44,787","00:16:47,138","I did it.
I... I conquered a planet."
227,"00:16:47,140","00:16:50,241",Huh?
228,"00:16:58,685","00:17:00,418",Hmm!
229,"00:17:05,692","00:17:08,159",Huh?
230,"00:17:10,597","00:17:12,797","So, now what?"
231,"00:17:12,799","00:17:15,500",Um...
232,"00:17:15,502","00:17:20,338","Right. Well, usually,
when a planet is conquered,"
233,"00:17:20,340","00:17:25,309","um, there's like pandemonium
and chaos all around."
234,"00:17:27,680","00:17:29,614","Uh, so I guess,"
235,"00:17:29,616","00:17:34,719","as your new leader, my first job
would be to bring, uh..."
236,"00:17:35,422","00:17:37,121",...peace.
237,"00:17:45,665","00:17:49,467",Here's our chance.
238,"00:17:49,469","00:17:51,702","- Yeah!
- Let's go!"
239,"00:17:51,704","00:17:56,240","I don't know what
we're doing, but I'm excited!"
240,"00:17:59,479","00:18:02,780","Now, guys, remember, peace."
241,"00:18:02,782","00:18:04,816","- Yeah!
- Oh, dear."
242,"00:18:30,276","00:18:33,277",Oh!
243,"00:18:33,279","00:18:36,681","Not so fun, is it?"
244,"00:18:36,683","00:18:41,385","You're not very good at this,
are you?"
245,"00:18:41,387","00:18:44,355",Time to run away!
246,"00:18:45,792","00:18:47,558",What?
247,"00:18:47,560","00:18:51,295","As ruler of this planet,"
248,"00:18:51,297","00:18:52,830",I order you to...
249,"00:18:52,832","00:18:55,900","- Why did you do that?
- I saved your life."
250,"00:18:55,902","00:18:57,168",Why?
251,"00:18:57,170","00:18:59,604","You have to be alive
to get home."
252,"00:18:59,606","00:19:01,555","Well, yes, but..."
253,"00:19:01,557","00:19:03,507","Somehow it feels like
now is not the best time"
254,"00:19:03,510","00:19:05,877",to be having this conversation.
255,"00:19:06,880","00:19:11,315",Whoa! Boost! Bo-o-ost!
256,"00:19:12,919","00:19:17,288",Rhino power!
257,"00:19:25,565","00:19:26,631",Huh?
258,"00:19:39,712","00:19:43,714","Hey. Wait.
No, d... no, don't!"
259,"00:19:56,896","00:20:00,364","I'm terribly sorry
about all of this."
260,"00:20:00,366","00:20:03,501","Oh, this? This is pretty normal
around here."
261,"00:20:03,503","00:20:06,804",Normal? You call this normal?
262,"00:20:06,806","00:20:08,873","Look here, Jelly Boy."
263,"00:20:08,875","00:20:11,642",I do have a name. I'm Fneep.
264,"00:20:11,644","00:20:12,677",What's your name?
265,"00:20:12,679","00:20:13,778","Ah, humph!"
266,"00:20:13,780","00:20:16,681","Humph, huh?
Pleased to meet you, Humph."
267,"00:20:16,683","00:20:19,550","- Humph?
- Oh, my turn!"
268,"00:20:19,552","00:20:22,420","- I want a name.
- Uh, OK."
269,"00:20:22,422","00:20:25,323","Um, well,
you've got a trunk, and..."
270,"00:20:25,325","00:20:28,326",Trunk! I love it!
271,"00:20:28,328","00:20:30,795","Oh, uh, wow. Um, OK then."
272,"00:20:30,797","00:20:33,564","Not quite where I was going,
but, yeah."
273,"00:20:33,566","00:20:36,400","- Hi, my name is Trunk.
- Yes..."
274,"00:20:36,402","00:20:39,337",Hello! Trunk here.
275,"00:20:39,339","00:20:44,008","Hey, there. Trunk."
276,"00:20:44,010","00:20:48,346","- Oh! Me! Me! Do me next.
- Fluffy Bum!"
277,"00:20:50,250","00:20:53,551","- Fluffy Bum!
- No, that can't be your name."
278,"00:20:53,553","00:20:55,953","- Banana Breath.
- Ooh, I do like bananas."
279,"00:20:55,955","00:20:57,989","- No!
- Ear Face."
280,"00:20:57,991","00:21:00,324","- Ear Face?
- Nose Boy."
281,"00:21:00,326","00:21:03,294","- No!
- Munkiii..."
282,"00:21:03,296","00:21:06,397","- Yes, Munki.
- I wasn't finished."
283,"00:21:06,399","00:21:08,833",Munki.
284,"00:21:08,835","00:21:12,770","- Pleased to meet you, Munki.
- And I'm Trunk, by the way."
285,"00:21:12,772","00:21:15,773","Yes, Trunk,
pleased to meet you too."
286,"00:21:18,044","00:21:19,577",And what about you?
287,"00:21:19,579","00:21:23,581","My name is Rockford Haberdashery
Pleasant the Third."
288,"00:21:23,583","00:21:26,384",But you can call me Rocky.
289,"00:21:27,887","00:21:30,521","Ball! Ball, ball, ball, ball..."
290,"00:21:30,523","00:21:33,424","Get away from me,
you great galoot!"
291,"00:21:33,426","00:21:36,927","Now your mission is done,
how do we get you home?"
292,"00:21:36,929","00:21:39,964","Ah, well... you see, my, uh..."
293,"00:21:39,966","00:21:42,667","my spaceship, it, um..."
294,"00:21:42,669","00:21:46,304","yeah, it's quite far away,
and it might be, uh..."
295,"00:21:46,306","00:21:48,372",just a teensy bit crashed.
296,"00:21:48,374","00:21:50,508","So it doesn't exactly fly
any more."
297,"00:21:50,510","00:21:53,744","- But then you can't go home.
- And..."
298,"00:21:55,948","00:21:59,083","No, no, but, but wait.
It may not fly,"
299,"00:21:59,085","00:22:01,552","but now that
I've conquered the planet,"
300,"00:22:01,554","00:22:05,323","I'm allowed to use the homing
beacon and they'll pick me up."
301,"00:22:05,325","00:22:08,693","They have to come anyway
to, uh, um..."
302,"00:22:08,695","00:22:12,663","well, to see this lovely planet
that I've conquered, obviously."
303,"00:22:12,665","00:22:14,465","Well, let's go to your ship."
304,"00:22:14,467","00:22:17,101","- Yeah!
- It's a long walk, I'm afraid."
305,"00:22:17,103","00:22:18,903",Long walk? I'm out!
306,"00:22:18,905","00:22:21,105","- You don't have to come.
- Oh, I'm coming!"
307,"00:22:21,107","00:22:23,808","- Why are you always so grumpy?
- Exactly."
308,"00:22:23,810","00:22:26,644","Let's get going
and get this over with."
309,"00:22:26,646","00:22:31,048","- Actually, it's this way.
- No, it's not, it's this way."
310,"00:22:33,920","00:22:35,953",Huh? What the...?
311,"00:22:43,596","00:22:45,396",Hmm!
312,"00:22:59,846","00:23:02,713",Huh?
313,"00:23:02,715","00:23:04,548",What? Hm?
314,"00:23:05,651","00:23:08,719",Oh! Hm-hm.
315,"00:23:13,960","00:23:15,826",Ah!
316,"00:23:15,828","00:23:17,661","♪ Scaldron, Scaldron"
317,"00:23:17,663","00:23:20,030","♪ Most terrifying planet
in the universe"
318,"00:23:20,032","00:23:22,166","♪ We're all really mean
and we're very, very strong"
319,"00:23:22,168","00:23:24,468","♪ We take what we want
and you can't stop us"
320,"00:23:24,470","00:23:27,872","♪ So there, so there, so there"
321,"00:23:27,874","00:23:32,009","♪ So there,
so there, so there"
322,"00:23:32,011","00:23:35,813","♪ So there, so there, so..."
323,"00:23:35,815","00:23:38,048","- ♪ There, so there
- Yeah. Yeah."
324,"00:23:42,889","00:23:46,624","- That's a great song.
- Yeah."
325,"00:23:46,626","00:23:48,426","A little bit treasonous, but..."
326,"00:23:50,897","00:23:53,130","What's Scaldron like?
You have mangoes there?"
327,"00:23:53,132","00:23:56,467","No. But we do have giant
flaming death tarantulas."
328,"00:23:56,469","00:23:58,452",How about pears?
329,"00:23:58,454","00:24:00,438","Most of the tarantulas
were eaten by doom snakes."
330,"00:24:00,440","00:24:02,456",Pineapples?
331,"00:24:02,458","00:24:04,475","And the snakes were dissolved
by acidic slime wolves."
332,"00:24:04,477","00:24:06,577",Oh. Bananas?
333,"00:24:06,579","00:24:11,215","- Oh yeah, huge bananas.
- Sounds amazing."
334,"00:24:32,104","00:24:35,806",Huh?
335,"00:24:36,609","00:24:38,843",Hm...
336,"00:25:19,151","00:25:20,918",This is great.
337,"00:25:20,920","00:25:24,955","It's like a backing track
for our triumphant new leader."
338,"00:25:24,957","00:25:28,125",Leader?
339,"00:25:28,127","00:25:31,729","There's only one leader
around here."
340,"00:25:31,731","00:25:34,899",And it is me.
341,"00:25:34,901","00:25:38,636","No, Fneep's the leader.
Aren't you, Fneep?"
342,"00:25:38,638","00:25:42,806","Well, yeah. Yeah. Yes, I am."
343,"00:25:42,808","00:25:44,909","I mean, I gave a speech
and everything."
344,"00:25:44,911","00:25:46,644",It was very good.
345,"00:25:46,646","00:25:50,047","I even, well, for a moment
at least, pointed my..."
346,"00:25:50,049","00:25:52,583","you know, G-U-N."
347,"00:25:52,585","00:25:54,585",A gnu?
348,"00:25:54,587","00:25:57,321","You pointed a gnu?
What does that even mean?"
349,"00:25:57,323","00:26:00,224","- No, that's not...
- Look, speech or no speech,"
350,"00:26:00,226","00:26:06,030","pointing gnu or no pointing gnu,
you are not the leader."
351,"00:26:06,032","00:26:08,699","- Am too.
- Ooh!"
352,"00:26:08,701","00:26:12,169","""Am too."" That's a good one.
I didn't see that coming."
353,"00:26:12,171","00:26:16,674","- Try saying ""Are not"" again.
- Brilliant. Yeah, OK, OK."
354,"00:26:17,810","00:26:20,945",Are not.
355,"00:26:20,947","00:26:24,648",Am too.
356,"00:26:24,650","00:26:27,184","Double repeat.
He went with the double repeat."
357,"00:26:27,186","00:26:31,088","He's good. Oh, wait, wait, wait.
I know."
358,"00:26:31,657","00:26:33,290",Why?
359,"00:26:33,292","00:26:34,792",Because.
360,"00:26:34,794","00:26:37,861","Curse your freakishly wily
retorts!"
361,"00:26:37,863","00:26:41,699","Try to stick your tongue out
and go..."
362,"00:26:41,701","00:26:46,937","- Like this? Aah..
- No, no, no."
363,"00:26:46,939","00:26:51,942","It's more closed, like this."
364,"00:26:51,944","00:26:53,844",Aah...
365,"00:26:53,846","00:26:56,380",Just tighten your lips and blow.
366,"00:27:00,052","00:27:02,653","Oh, I got it!"
367,"00:27:06,292","00:27:07,992",Where are you going?
368,"00:27:07,994","00:27:11,228","- Back to my ship.
- Stop him!"
369,"00:27:18,838","00:27:21,271",Huh?!
370,"00:27:21,273","00:27:25,042",Huh? That is very disconcerting!
371,"00:27:25,044","00:27:26,844",Oh.
372,"00:27:27,680","00:27:29,046",Um...
373,"00:27:29,048","00:27:31,949",Sorry.
374,"00:27:31,951","00:27:34,652","Pardon me.
Coming through."

you can do it,"

We live on the ground."

Then what are these for?"

Lead the way."

It's back to the nest for you."
470,"00:33:58,670","00:34:01,138","Can I try again?
If I was a bit higher,"
471,"00:34:01,140","00:34:02,439",I'd have enough forward thrust
472,"00:34:02,441","00:34:05,175","and the air-pressure
differential would be able"
473,"00:34:05,177","00:34:07,511","to generate sufficient lift
to be able to fly."
474,"00:34:07,513","00:34:11,114","I'm not letting you
out of my sight again."
475,"00:34:11,116","00:34:14,117","- Come along.

480,"00:34:55,094","00:34:57,427",Huh?
481,"00:35:33,265","00:35:35,765","You OK?
What happened back there?"
482,"00:35:35,767","00:35:37,667","Why was she
squeezing her?"
483,"00:35:37,669","00:35:39,803","- Huh?
- The mother one."
484,"00:35:39,805","00:35:43,340","Why was she
squeezing the baby one?"
485,"00:35:43,342","00:35:47,244","Squeezing?
Oh, that's called a hug."
486,"00:35:47,246","00:35:50,413","You don't have hugs
where you're from?"
487,"00:35:50,415","00:35:51,414",What's it for?
488,"00:35:51,416","00:35:54,284",It's to make you feel better.
489,"00:35:54,286","00:35:56,186","To say, ""I love you."""
490,"00:35:56,188","00:35:58,455","To let you know
you're not alone."
491,"00:35:58,457","00:36:01,625",To let you know you're special.
492,"00:36:01,627","00:36:04,628","I can't believe you don't have
hugs where you're from."
493,"00:36:04,630","00:36:06,563","How do you say ""I love you""?"
494,"00:36:06,565","00:36:08,632","Well, we don't."
495,"00:36:08,634","00:36:13,470","What?
How do you ever feel special?"
496,"00:36:13,472","00:36:15,906","The only way to do that
is to conquer planets."
497,"00:36:15,908","00:36:18,708","That shows you're strong
and worthy of respect."
498,"00:36:18,710","00:36:21,211","The more planets,
the more respect,"
499,"00:36:21,213","00:36:23,680",and the more special you feel.
500,"00:36:23,682","00:36:25,215",Or so I've heard.
501,"00:36:25,217","00:36:28,785","Sounds like pretty hard work
to feel special."
502,"00:36:28,787","00:36:33,657","But you haven't conquered
any planets until this one."
503,"00:36:33,659","00:36:36,626","You don't need
to remind me."
504,"00:36:36,628","00:36:40,664","Has no one ever told you
you're special before?"
505,"00:36:41,733","00:36:43,934",Hu-u-u-ug!
506,"00:36:43,936","00:36:45,669","No, that's quite all right."
507,"00:36:45,671","00:36:48,471","Hug, hug, hug, hug, hug, hug!"
508,"00:36:48,473","00:36:50,189",It doesn't matter to us
509,"00:36:50,191","00:36:51,908","that you haven't conquered
lots of planets."
510,"00:36:51,910","00:36:54,945","- Yeah.
- Hug, hug, hug, hug, hug."
511,"00:36:54,947","00:36:56,947",Get back!
512,"00:36:59,318","00:37:02,285","Please, just don't, OK?"
513,"00:37:03,322","00:37:05,422",Hug?
514,"00:37:46,365","00:37:48,698",Huh? Huh?
515,"00:38:25,070","00:38:26,986",What's that?
516,"00:38:26,988","00:38:28,905","I didn't have breakfast
this morning."
517,"00:38:28,907","00:38:32,742","Sometimes there just aren't
enough bananas to go around!"
518,"00:38:34,379","00:38:37,580","Oh, somebody get him
something to eat quick!"
519,"00:38:37,582","00:38:40,450",Running.
520,"00:38:43,655","00:38:46,389","Oh, they're coming this way!"
521,"00:38:50,729","00:38:55,532","- Running!
- Climb up quick! Come on."
522,"00:38:55,534","00:38:57,434",Grab on. You'll be safe up here.
523,"00:38:57,436","00:39:00,403","I can't. It's against the rules
to be safe."
524,"00:39:01,540","00:39:02,906",Incoming!
525,"00:39:02,908","00:39:05,342",Come on! I'm trying to help you.
526,"00:39:05,344","00:39:06,776",Why do you keep trying to help?
527,"00:39:06,778","00:39:09,846","I'm a Scaldronian. Scaldronians
never ask for help. Never!"
528,"00:39:09,848","00:39:12,415","Well, monkeys always help.
Always!"
529,"00:39:12,417","00:39:14,617",And elephants! Get up here!
530,"00:39:14,619","00:39:18,088","OK.
We're backing up, backing up."
531,"00:39:19,858","00:39:21,391",What are you doing?
532,"00:39:21,393","00:39:24,060","I won't leave you alone
down here."
533,"00:39:24,062","00:39:26,363","Guys, you're gonna get smooshed!"
534,"00:39:26,365","00:39:28,932","- Get back up!
- Not without you!"
535,"00:39:28,934","00:39:32,869","- Why won't you just let me be?
- Because we're your friends!"
536,"00:39:32,871","00:39:36,573",Smooshing imminent!
537,"00:39:39,811","00:39:42,445","So, just to confirm,"
538,"00:39:42,447","00:39:45,582","I'm still the lead singer,
right?"
539,"00:39:45,584","00:39:47,851","Yes, you are."
540,"00:39:47,853","00:39:50,587",Great. Glad that's settled.
541,"00:39:51,790","00:39:53,757",Why didn't you climb on board?
542,"00:39:53,759","00:39:56,059","Did you not hear
about the smooshing?"
543,"00:39:56,061","00:39:58,411",I can't keep taking your help.
544,"00:39:58,413","00:40:00,764","You don't understand what it is
to have your planet conquered."
545,"00:40:00,766","00:40:02,432","Uh, nope!"
546,"00:40:02,434","00:40:05,034","But we do understand something
about home."
547,"00:40:05,036","00:40:07,537","You're not supposed
to want to help me get home!"
548,"00:40:07,539","00:40:10,907","- You're not supposed to like me.
- But we were just trying to..."
549,"00:40:10,909","00:40:13,543","Help. I know.
I wish you wouldn't."
550,"00:40:13,545","00:40:17,013","You're making this much harder
for me than it should be."
551,"00:40:17,015","00:40:18,982","I really wish
you'd leave me alone now"
552,"00:40:18,984","00:40:22,819","and stop trying to be
so nice to me."
553,"00:40:26,091","00:40:28,925",He seems a bit down.
554,"00:40:28,927","00:40:31,060","He's never had a,"
555,"00:40:31,062","00:40:35,432","you know, H-U-G before."
556,"00:40:35,434","00:40:37,567",What's a hgu?
557,"00:40:39,805","00:40:43,640","Rolling, rolling, rolling..."
558,"00:40:43,642","00:40:47,510",Rolling? Huh! I can talk again.
559,"00:40:47,512","00:40:51,114",Whoa! Dizzy.
560,"00:40:51,116","00:40:53,683","I like it. What? No, I don't."
561,"00:40:53,685","00:40:56,119","You like it.
Who said that? What?"
562,"00:40:56,121","00:41:01,658","OK, I'm talking, so I must be
close to the others."
563,"00:41:03,829","00:41:07,630","Wait until I find you,
give you a piece of my mind."
564,"00:41:07,632","00:41:10,033","Not just one piece.
I'll give you three."
565,"00:41:10,035","00:41:14,137","Tell you what, let's make it
four. Do I hear five? Huh?"
566,"00:41:18,910","00:41:20,677",Oh!
567,"00:41:20,679","00:41:22,779",Shiny.
568,"00:41:43,535","00:41:46,002",Oh. Oh!
569,"00:41:48,707","00:41:51,007",Nyah!
570,"00:41:52,811","00:41:54,878",Oh...
571,"00:41:57,249","00:42:00,984","That's the shiniest thing
I've ever seen."
572,"00:42:00,986","00:42:05,221","I want to touch it.
I want to taste it."
573,"00:42:06,925","00:42:10,693","No! It's a bad idea!
Definitely a bad idea."
574,"00:42:10,695","00:42:13,129","And yet, somehow I..."
575,"00:42:13,131","00:42:15,732","No. No, no, no, no, no, no, no."
576,"00:42:16,701","00:42:20,069",Ah! Aa-a-ah!
577,"00:42:29,014","00:42:31,597","Fneep,"
578,"00:42:31,599","00:42:34,183","report on your current status
immediately."
579,"00:42:37,022","00:42:39,589","Fneep,
it has been two Earth months"
580,"00:42:39,591","00:42:43,293","since your last report.
Feedback immediately."
581,"00:42:44,930","00:42:47,964","How much longer
is it going to be, Fneep?"
582,"00:42:47,966","00:42:49,566",The transporters are ready.
583,"00:42:49,568","00:42:51,568","Once you have conquered
the planet,"
584,"00:42:51,570","00:42:54,037","we initiate the removal
of the Earth creatures."
585,"00:42:54,039","00:42:56,339",Report back immediately!
586,"00:42:56,341","00:42:59,976","Take us away? I must warn
the others. I gotta..."
587,"00:43:33,612","00:43:35,912","You're still there, aren't you?"
588,"00:43:38,883","00:43:40,617",Oh.
589,"00:43:44,255","00:43:46,789",It's very lonely being alone.
590,"00:43:46,791","00:43:49,959","We'll stay with you
until you feel better."
591,"00:44:13,818","00:44:16,386","Uh, is this...?
What's, what's going..."
592,"00:44:16,388","00:44:19,088","I didn't quite follow that
at all. Um..."
593,"00:44:19,090","00:44:23,059","It's just
close to our bedtime."
594,"00:44:23,061","00:44:25,928","When the sun sets,
we go to sleep."
595,"00:44:25,930","00:44:28,064",Sunset.
596,"00:44:28,833","00:44:31,834",It's... It's...
597,"00:44:31,836","00:44:34,303","We don't get sunsets
on Scaldron."
598,"00:44:34,305","00:44:37,306","Not since
we set the atmosphere on fire."
599,"00:44:37,308","00:44:42,945","You should see a sunrise.
It's amazing."
600,"00:44:56,795","00:44:58,327",Huh?
601,"00:45:07,872","00:45:11,374",Hm.
602,"00:45:29,327","00:45:32,462","- I say.
- How wonderful."
603,"00:45:32,464","00:45:36,966","- Amazing.
- So beautiful."
604,"00:45:40,972","00:45:43,372",Behold Fneep's star!
605,"00:45:43,374","00:45:47,944","He has conquered a planet,
and become a Scaldronian hero!"
606,"00:45:47,946","00:45:50,213",Fneep!
607,"00:45:50,215","00:45:53,149","Fneep's so awesome,
amazing and not insignificant."
608,"00:45:53,151","00:45:55,218","He's not
a disappointment."
609,"00:45:55,220","00:45:58,855","I love that he's shorter
and smaller than the rest of us!"
610,"00:45:58,857","00:46:00,757","Yes, Fneep,"

733,"00:57:53,571","00:57:54,970",Another possesses the power

right out of you"
735,"00:57:57,541","00:58:01,477","- without even touching you.
- I don't do that. Do I?"

a giant creature"

- Yes."
739,"00:58:11,188","00:58:14,923","Able to crush anything
in its path!"
740,"00:58:14,925","00:58:19,528","Another one so furry
and with a tail so..."
741,"00:58:19,530","00:58:22,564","- Furry? And a tail?
- Yes!"

746,"00:58:32,610","00:58:36,745","this piddly planet
isn't really worth my time."

you won't be going home again?"
748,"00:58:40,618","00:58:42,551","It's straight on
to the next planet"
749,"00:58:42,553","00:58:44,920",for you to fail to conquer.

754,"00:59:09,680","00:59:14,116","It's the only way to stop you
being so weedy and useless."
755,"00:59:35,339","00:59:37,673",Attention all hands.
756,"00:59:37,675","00:59:41,610","Gather in the main atrium
for Fneep shaming."
757,"00:59:43,714","00:59:46,915","- Rubbish.
- So insignificant."
758,"00:59:46,917","00:59:49,885","- Such a disappointment.
- So much shorter and smaller"
759,"00:59:49,887","00:59:51,286",than the rest of us.
760,"00:59:51,288","00:59:54,222","I had money
on you doing this, boy."
761,"00:59:54,224","00:59:56,925","Prepare
for launch initiation."
762,"01:00:33,931","01:00:37,265","Set sights for...
Where should it be?"
763,"01:00:37,267","01:00:40,736",The Endless Bogs of Scorpulus?
764,"01:00:40,738","01:00:43,672",The Stench World of Gamma Six?
765,"01:00:43,674","01:00:47,643",The Flame Fields of... Dennis.
766,"01:00:47,645","01:00:51,213","Or the Un-Planet
of Quadrant Elty-Two?"
767,"01:00:51,215","01:00:55,183","Where is it
you would like to go, Fneep?"
768,"01:00:55,185","01:00:56,652",Home.
769,"01:00:56,654","01:00:58,353",What was that?
770,"01:01:00,391","01:01:03,091",Hey?
771,"01:01:03,093","01:01:05,293","Pod breach, level one."
772,"01:01:14,672","01:01:18,173","I said, he'd like to go home!"
773,"01:01:18,175","01:01:19,875",What is this?
774,"01:01:19,877","01:01:21,710",It's not safe for you here.
775,"01:01:21,712","01:01:25,113","Ha! I laugh in the face
of not safeness."
776,"01:01:25,115","01:01:27,249","Oh, Fneep,"
777,"01:01:27,251","01:01:32,721","is that the fury-ball of spikes?
Really? That little thing?"
778,"01:01:32,723","01:01:35,357","Coochy, coochy, coochy."
779,"01:01:35,359","01:01:36,992",Huh!
780,"01:01:36,994","01:01:38,326",A-ha!
781,"01:01:38,328","01:01:39,361",Aah!
782,"01:01:39,363","01:01:41,697",Oh!
783,"01:01:41,699","01:01:45,467",A-ha! Me likey spikey.
784,"01:01:45,469","01:01:49,805","- We said we'd help you get home.
- That's what we're going to do."
785,"01:01:49,807","01:01:52,107",The only way Fneep is going home
786,"01:01:52,109","01:01:55,010","is when he's conquered a planet
and that's never..."
787,"01:01:55,012","01:01:57,746",He has conquered one! This one!
788,"01:01:57,748","01:01:59,948","- Haven't you, Fneep?
- No, he didn't."
789,"01:01:59,950","01:02:02,451","He said he lied
about conquering it."
790,"01:02:02,453","01:02:05,787",I... lied about lying?
791,"01:02:05,789","01:02:08,857","- You did conquer it?
- Uh, yes."
792,"01:02:08,859","01:02:10,325",And we're his captives.
793,"01:02:10,327","01:02:11,993",Is that true?
794,"01:02:11,995","01:02:16,198","Um, I, uh... guess so. But..."
795,"01:02:16,200","01:02:20,035","He can release us
if he wants to. Can't you?"
796,"01:02:20,037","01:02:23,038","Well, yes, I guess I can."
797,"01:02:23,040","01:02:24,139","No, you can't!"
798,"01:02:24,141","01:02:25,841",We're Scaldronians!
799,"01:02:25,843","01:02:28,376","Scaldronians
don't just release captives."
800,"01:02:28,378","01:02:30,912","That's the opposite
of what Scaldronians do."
801,"01:02:30,914","01:02:33,181","It's my planet.
I can do what I like with it."
802,"01:02:33,183","01:02:35,183","It's not your planet yet, Fneep."
803,"01:02:35,185","01:02:37,853","I don't see your star
in the sky."
804,"01:02:37,855","01:02:41,256","And if your star
isn't in the sky,"
805,"01:02:41,258","01:02:43,058",the planet remains open.
806,"01:02:43,060","01:02:47,863","I think perhaps I'll conquer it
myself after all."
807,"01:02:47,865","01:02:50,899",Surrender to me or...
808,"01:02:50,901","01:02:52,534",Be careful. It's new.
809,"01:02:52,536","01:02:54,936","Don't you know
it's rude to point?"
810,"01:02:54,938","01:02:57,339","I didn't know
it was rude to point."
811,"01:02:57,341","01:03:01,476","I'd point all day long.
I'd point at you and you"
812,"01:03:01,478","01:03:04,479","and you and you
and you and you..."
813,"01:03:04,481","01:03:07,215",What is this thing anyway?
814,"01:03:14,158","01:03:16,525","Be careful, Trunk,
don't press..."
815,"01:03:16,527","01:03:18,927",...that.
816,"01:03:23,167","01:03:24,833",Trunk!
817,"01:03:59,203","01:04:02,304",Huh?! Oh!
818,"01:04:04,208","01:04:05,507",Huh?!
819,"01:04:24,194","01:04:27,562","Whoopsy, Fneep. Lost your star?"
820,"01:04:27,564","01:04:32,033","Never mind,
I have mine right here."
821,"01:04:32,035","01:04:37,939","We wouldn't want this planet
to go unclaimed now, would we?"
822,"01:04:37,941","01:04:40,108","Hey, what the...?"
823,"01:04:42,145","01:04:46,448","That's right.
Furry and with a tail."
824,"01:04:51,455","01:04:53,588","Oh, dear!"
825,"01:05:03,400","01:05:05,333",Uh-oh.
826,"01:05:09,306","01:05:11,439",Whoa!
827,"01:05:22,419","01:05:24,519",Gotcha!
828,"01:05:24,521","01:05:27,522",Huh?!
829,"01:05:27,524","01:05:30,358",Huh?
830,"01:05:37,334","01:05:40,268",Hey. Wait. Leave me alone.
831,"01:05:40,270","01:05:42,704","Hey, get your hands
off my friend!"
832,"01:05:42,706","01:05:44,339","I mean, uh..."
833,"01:05:44,341","01:05:48,009","Friend?
You were gonna say friend."
834,"01:05:48,011","01:05:49,978","No. I mean, uh..."
835,"01:05:49,980","01:05:52,480","Rule number six:
never finish a word"
836,"01:05:52,482","01:05:56,318","- that I'm beginning to finish.
- Frie-e-end!"
837,"01:06:02,025","01:06:04,626",Oh...
838,"01:06:11,335","01:06:15,236","I've gotta launch my star.
Now, where did I...?"
839,"01:06:15,238","01:06:16,972",Oh.
840,"01:06:23,113","01:06:25,480","Ooh, look at this."
841,"01:06:25,482","01:06:29,617","- I wonder what it does.
- Let me see. I wanna..."
842,"01:06:29,619","01:06:32,420","Oh, who am I kidding?"
843,"01:06:32,422","01:06:34,656",It looks like some sort of egg.
844,"01:06:34,658","01:06:38,660","Egg? This nest
ain't big enough... Whoa!"
845,"01:06:38,662","01:06:42,764","It's OK, Mama.
You don't need to cheer me up."
846,"01:06:42,766","01:06:47,168","It's OK that I can't fly.
I'm just going to..."
847,"01:06:47,170","01:06:52,140","crawl around on the ground
like a little worm."
848,"01:06:58,081","01:07:01,349","- Trunk.
- Fneep's star thingy!"
849,"01:07:01,351","01:07:03,084","This is Fneep's star thingy,"
850,"01:07:03,086","01:07:06,388","the things he needs to shoot
into the sky to save us!"
851,"01:07:08,358","01:07:12,027","Um, I'm not sure
if I understand you, dear."
852,"01:07:12,029","01:07:15,296",Or that.
853,"01:07:21,671","01:07:24,572",I know you're here somewhere!
854,"01:07:26,510","01:07:29,778",Hm?
855,"01:07:30,480","01:07:33,448",What?
856,"01:07:39,523","01:07:41,056",Huh?
857,"01:08:04,114","01:08:05,447",Oh!
858,"01:08:17,227","01:08:19,627",Ha-ha!
859,"01:08:19,629","01:08:21,830","- Huh?!
- Ha-ha as well!"
860,"01:08:21,832","01:08:25,733",Here I am! Now I'm here.
861,"01:08:30,440","01:08:31,739",Trunk!
862,"01:08:33,443","01:08:35,510","- Munki?
- Fneep needs his star!"
863,"01:08:35,512","01:08:37,412","- I know.
- What's going on?"
864,"01:08:37,414","01:08:42,717","- Munki's flying.
- Oh, sure, Munki's flying."
865,"01:08:42,719","01:08:44,486",Not that I care.
866,"01:08:44,488","01:08:50,391","I get to crawl in the depths
of despair and disappointment"
867,"01:08:50,393","01:08:54,329","for the rest of my life.
Whoopee."
868,"01:08:55,599","01:08:57,732","If Fneep doesn't
get that star,"
869,"01:08:57,734","01:08:59,234","- we're doomed!
- Yes..."
870,"01:08:59,236","01:09:01,402","The future of the world
is in your hands."
871,"01:09:01,404","01:09:03,371","- I got that!
- No pressure."
872,"01:09:03,373","01:09:08,443","But really,
it's kind of a big de-e-e-eal!"
873,"01:09:09,646","01:09:11,446",Shoot it up there.
874,"01:09:11,448","01:09:16,518","Oh. It'll bounce off the ship.
I need someone to take it."
875,"01:09:16,520","01:09:19,821","Me! Me, me, me, me, me!
I can take it!"
876,"01:09:19,823","01:09:22,757","No chance, young lady.
You're gonna stay..."
877,"01:09:22,759","01:09:26,461","Right here
for the rest of my life,"
878,"01:09:26,463","01:09:28,396",never doing anything?
879,"01:09:28,398","01:09:31,866","- No, that's not...!
- Mama, I can do this."
880,"01:09:31,868","01:09:34,569","I've been waiting my whole life
for this."
881,"01:09:34,571","01:09:36,604","- You hatched yesterday.
- Shh!"
882,"01:09:36,606","01:09:39,474","How can I let Trunk
shoot you up there?"
883,"01:09:39,476","01:09:42,844","- What if she misses?
- Ahem. Hm!"
884,"01:09:48,285","01:09:51,853",Hm!
885,"01:09:53,456","01:09:56,324",Pistachios.
886,"01:09:56,326","01:09:58,359","Surely it's not
that important that..."
887,"01:09:58,361","01:10:00,728","Once again,
it's really, really important"
888,"01:10:00,730","01:10:04,332",that Fneep gets that star!
889,"01:10:05,435","01:10:08,803","Whether I like it
or not,"
890,"01:10:08,805","01:10:11,806","you were not born
to stay in this nest."
891,"01:10:11,808","01:10:15,677","And whether I understand it
or not,"
892,"01:10:15,679","01:10:18,279",you were born for the sky.
893,"01:10:18,281","01:10:21,816","Yes! Yes, yes, yes,
yes, yes, yes, yes, yes!"
894,"01:10:21,818","01:10:23,551",Thank you!
895,"01:10:26,790","01:10:29,958","Just hold on to this thing.
I'll get you to Fneep."
896,"01:10:29,960","01:10:31,960","Yes, sir, ma'am, sir!"
897,"01:10:35,899","01:10:37,932","I'm gonna fly, Mama."
898,"01:10:37,934","01:10:42,270","Yes, you are, dear.
Yes, you are."
899,"01:10:45,775","01:10:47,809",Wow.
900,"01:11:07,264","01:11:11,032","Oh, no!"
901,"01:11:11,034","01:11:14,936",Hold on!
902,"01:11:58,581","01:12:00,515",Whoa!
903,"01:12:00,950","01:12:02,450",Whoa!
904,"01:12:04,854","01:12:06,954",Enough!
905,"01:12:15,031","01:12:18,666","You know,
now seems like a good time"
906,"01:12:18,668","01:12:21,336",for an intimidating speech.
907,"01:12:21,338","01:12:24,906","Something to put the fear
of Scaldron into you."
908,"01:12:24,908","01:12:29,711","Something to really let you know
how badly you've lost."
909,"01:12:29,713","01:12:32,914",Let me see.
910,"01:12:32,916","01:12:34,515",Stampede.
911,"01:12:34,517","01:12:35,950",What? What is it?
912,"01:12:35,952","01:12:39,454","- Stampede.
- Stampede?"
913,"01:12:39,456","01:12:40,922",What?
914,"01:12:48,832","01:12:53,968",Furry... and with a tail!
915,"01:13:02,379","01:13:04,912","- Stampede!
- No! No! No! No!"
916,"01:13:04,914","01:13:11,085","- I'm Grogon the...
- Stampe-e-e-ede."
917,"01:13:16,693","01:13:19,861",Special delivery for Fneep.
918,"01:13:22,665","01:13:23,998",Hah!
919,"01:13:29,606","01:13:31,406",Huh!
920,"01:13:34,577","01:13:38,646","Oh, uh... Hey-hey, chaps."
921,"01:13:38,648","01:13:40,715","Ever read point 65,
sub-section 12"
922,"01:13:40,717","01:13:42,917",of the user manual?
923,"01:13:43,620","01:13:46,170","- Huh?
- Hm..."
924,"01:13:46,172","01:13:48,723","About how to distract someone
so they don't see what's coming?"
925,"01:14:09,979","01:14:11,779",Huh? Uh-oh!
926,"01:14:21,157","01:14:22,623",Oh!
927,"01:14:32,001","01:14:35,002",Oh! Flying!
928,"01:14:41,077","01:14:42,810",Huh?!
929,"01:14:42,812","01:14:44,745",Fneep!
930,"01:14:44,747","01:14:46,981","Have you ever read point 65,"
931,"01:14:46,983","01:14:49,884","sub-section 12
of the user manual?"
932,"01:14:49,886","01:14:52,787","Yeah, about how
to distract someone while..."
933,"01:14:52,789","01:14:58,659","- Oh, dear.
- Never fails."
934,"01:15:02,599","01:15:06,100","Oh, no! That's the wrong colour."
935,"01:15:19,549","01:15:25,987","There it is, Fneep.
One thousand planets."
936,"01:15:25,989","01:15:29,123","- No.
- What do you mean, no?"
937,"01:15:29,125","01:15:32,093",Your star may be in the sky
938,"01:15:32,095","01:15:34,262","but you've not
conquered the animals yet."
939,"01:15:34,264","01:15:37,265","Ha! Judging
by this lot, that'll be easy."
940,"01:15:37,267","01:15:40,301","You may think so,
but they have a secret weapon."
941,"01:15:40,303","01:15:44,972","A-ha! Of course!
Our secret... weapon?"
942,"01:15:44,974","01:15:47,108",What's our secret weapon?
943,"01:15:48,845","01:15:50,144",Something more powerful
944,"01:15:50,146","01:15:52,647","than anything
I've ever witnessed."
945,"01:15:52,649","01:15:54,916","- More powerful than...
- Yes!"
946,"01:15:54,918","01:15:58,185","More powerful than
the Power Bolt of Gustagoriopia!"
947,"01:15:58,187","01:16:00,721","- Even more powerful than...
- Yes!"
948,"01:16:00,723","01:16:03,958","Even more powerful than
the Blinding Eye of Mezmorio!"
949,"01:16:03,960","01:16:04,959","- More...
- Yes!"
950,"01:16:04,961","01:16:08,829","- Mo...
- Yes! Yes!"
951,"01:16:08,831","01:16:10,231",And here it is.
952,"01:16:19,976","01:16:23,077","What is it? Get it off!
Get it off! Get it off!"
953,"01:16:23,079","01:16:27,281",It's a hug.
954,"01:16:28,618","01:16:30,751","You're my father,
and I love you."
955,"01:16:35,592","01:16:36,724",What's happening?
956,"01:16:36,726","01:16:40,695","Don't worry, you'll be OK."
957,"01:16:40,697","01:16:45,700",What are you doing to me?
958,"01:16:45,702","01:16:48,202",I'm making you feel special.
959,"01:17:08,758","01:17:12,093","- That's it.
- Huh? What?"
960,"01:17:12,095","01:17:13,861",What are you looking at?
961,"01:17:13,863","01:17:15,663",You've never had a hug before.
962,"01:17:15,665","01:17:17,898",Hugs! Who needs hugs?
963,"01:17:17,900","01:17:22,203","Stupid, soft, mooshy.
Wh-Wh-What are you doing?"
964,"01:17:22,205","01:17:24,405","That's why
you're always so grumpy."
965,"01:17:24,407","01:17:27,141",Nonsense! What are you doing?
966,"01:17:27,143","01:17:29,644","Oh, you know you want one."
967,"01:17:29,646","01:17:31,178",Step away from the hedgehog!
968,"01:17:31,180","01:17:35,349","All along
you just needed..."
969,"01:17:37,186","01:17:39,353","OK, let me just..."
970,"01:17:39,355","01:17:40,688",Ha! You see.
971,"01:17:40,690","01:17:43,791","No touchy,
no huggy the spiky man."
972,"01:17:48,698","01:17:52,800","- I... I feel...
- Warm and fuzzy?"
973,"01:17:52,802","01:17:55,169","- Yes.
- Special?"
974,"01:17:55,171","01:17:59,173",Yes! You must all feel this!
975,"01:18:15,425","01:18:18,359","Ground, ground,
ground, ground..."
976,"01:18:18,361","01:18:20,428",Oh!
977,"01:18:22,799","01:18:24,999","Ground,
ground, ground..."
978,"01:18:36,813","01:18:40,114",See? I told you I could fly!
979,"01:18:40,116","01:18:41,482",Yeah!
980,"01:18:45,988","01:18:48,122",Whoo-hoo!
981,"01:19:08,010","01:19:10,978",It's all yours.
982,"01:19:14,517","01:19:16,050",I can't do this.
983,"01:19:16,052","01:19:19,320","This planet belongs
to all of you, not me."
984,"01:19:19,322","01:19:22,389","Yeah, but I wanna see
some fireworks!"
985,"01:19:22,391","01:19:26,260",OK. But I'm doing it my way.
986,"01:19:28,431","01:19:31,398","- Say ""Fneep!""
- You don't tell me what to say."
987,"01:19:31,400","01:19:33,901","- You don't have to.
- I'll say it."
988,"01:19:33,903","01:19:38,072","I'll say the heck out of it!
Fffne-e-e-ep!"
989,"01:19:39,408","01:19:43,177","Ah, was I blinking?
I think I blinked."
990,"01:19:49,852","01:19:52,186","- Oh!
- Way to go!"
991,"01:19:52,188","01:19:54,789","- I am so proud of you.
- Thanks, guys."
992,"01:19:54,791","01:19:57,024",Come here.
993,"01:19:57,026","01:20:00,995","I couldn't have done it
without you, you know."
994,"01:20:02,932","01:20:05,166","Time to go home, son."
995,"01:20:05,168","01:20:07,535","Aren't we going to get
your thousandth planet?"
996,"01:20:07,537","01:20:10,437","But of course.
I have just the planet in mind,"
997,"01:20:10,439","01:20:12,907",and you can help me conquer it.
998,"01:20:12,909","01:20:15,176","- Scaldron.
- Our planet?"
999,"01:20:15,178","01:20:17,978","Yes, I have a new secret weapon,"
1000,"01:20:17,980","01:20:21,515","which I think
our own people could use."
1001,"01:20:21,517","01:20:26,086","Hug. Hug, hug, hugging."
1002,"01:20:26,088","01:20:28,322","I can never repay you all
properly,"
1003,"01:20:28,324","01:20:30,291","but... here, you can have this."
1004,"01:20:30,293","01:20:32,893","- Peach!
- No!"
1005,"01:20:32,895","01:20:35,095","- Hm.
- I'm going to miss you."
1006,"01:20:35,097","01:20:36,831","- No, I'm not!
- What?"
1007,"01:20:36,833","01:20:39,567","- Exactly!
- Right. Yeah."

already has her present."
