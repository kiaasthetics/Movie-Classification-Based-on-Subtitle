1,"00:00:28,319","00:00:31,447","I'm going to tell you a fairytale,"
2,"00:00:31,531","00:00:33,533",and it's about Christmas.
3,"00:00:34,116","00:00:36,869","Well, it's not really about Christmas,"
4,"00:00:36,953","00:00:38,579",but it happened at Christmastime.
5,"00:00:39,080","00:00:42,208",And it's not really a fairytale.
6,"00:00:42,291","00:00:43,709",Because this happened...
7,"00:00:43,793","00:00:46,420",in real life!
8,"00:00:49,090","00:00:53,886",Fantefilm presents
9,"00:00:58,057","00:01:03,062","From: Alf PrÃ¸ysen's
wonderful universe"
10,"00:01:09,860","00:01:13,030","It started on the night
before Christmas Eve."
11,"00:01:13,114","00:01:14,699",Almost everything was ready.
12,"00:01:16,117","00:01:18,703","- Be careful!
- I am being careful."
13,"00:01:18,786","00:01:20,871","- Is that a new word for you?
- Yes, it is."
14,"00:01:20,955","00:01:22,039","""Careful""."
15,"00:01:22,748","00:01:24,375","- One more.
- Which hand?"
16,"00:01:24,458","00:01:25,459",That one.
17,"00:01:33,968","00:01:37,388","Can't you just give me both
and let me choose?"
18,"00:01:38,306","00:01:40,641","- That would be much easier.
- Here..."
19,"00:01:41,475","00:01:43,019",And here!
20,"00:01:49,734","00:01:51,777","- And the star.
- Okay."
21,"00:02:06,459","00:02:07,918",It looks lovely.
22,"00:02:08,002","00:02:09,670",Beautiful!
23,"00:02:17,261","00:02:18,721","- What is it?
- Shh!"
24,"00:02:18,804","00:02:20,348",There's a squirrel in the tree.
25,"00:02:20,473","00:02:21,766",Little Brother...
26,"00:02:22,808","00:02:25,019","- Yes?
- Go get that bowl of nuts."
27,"00:02:30,858","00:02:35,029","Come here, little squirrel!
Do you want a delicious nut?"
28,"00:02:36,280","00:02:37,615",Where did you go?
29,"00:02:37,740","00:02:39,867","- Where is it?
- Be quiet!"
30,"00:02:41,994","00:02:43,120","Oh, no!"
31,"00:02:43,245","00:02:46,082","What a lovely tree!
Should we turn on..."
32,"00:02:46,207","00:02:47,458","No, no, no!"
33,"00:02:55,508","00:02:56,509",Roger?
34,"00:02:57,468","00:02:58,469",Roger?
35,"00:02:58,928","00:03:01,222",What in the world is going on here?
36,"00:03:01,305","00:03:03,974",You have to ask Mariann.
37,"00:03:04,684","00:03:07,311","Well? Then, let's hear it!"
38,"00:03:07,395","00:03:09,188","Well, I saw a squirrel in the tree,"
39,"00:03:09,271","00:03:13,275","and just wanted to give it a nut,
and then I dropped the bowl."
40,"00:03:13,359","00:03:15,444",So it was a squirrel this time?
41,"00:03:17,947","00:03:21,158","Earlier, you thought a snowman
could speak."
42,"00:03:21,242","00:03:24,078","Last week, you saw a troll
under the woodshed, remember?"
43,"00:03:24,161","00:03:26,706",And what did that troll turn out to be?
44,"00:03:27,206","00:03:28,416",A broom.
45,"00:03:28,457","00:03:31,794","Exactly, a broom.
And there is no squirrel in that tree!"
46,"00:03:31,919","00:03:33,087",But I saw it!
47,"00:03:33,212","00:03:35,798",Stop imagining things everywhere!
48,"00:03:36,549","00:03:39,635",This is my father.
49,"00:03:39,760","00:03:42,054","And this is me, Mariann."
50,"00:03:43,097","00:03:46,517","Poor Dad. He gets a little angry
from time to time."
51,"00:03:46,600","00:03:49,478","But he's actually very, very nice."
52,"00:03:49,895","00:03:54,150","He just gets so frustrated
when he doesn't see what I see."
53,"00:03:54,984","00:03:57,111",But we usually figure things out.
54,"00:03:57,194","00:03:59,613","And this Christmas,
it wasn't such a big deal."
55,"00:03:59,697","00:04:02,199",We just had to get a new tree.
56,"00:04:02,283","00:04:04,994","Before you say anything,
that one is too wide."
57,"00:04:05,077","00:04:06,495",We need to make a decision soon.
58,"00:04:06,579","00:04:09,665","This tree says it doesn't want
to be a Christmas tree."
59,"00:04:11,333","00:04:14,754","What? Don't all trees
want to be Christmas trees?"
60,"00:04:14,837","00:04:22,845","No. This one wants to be with its family.
See? Here is the father and the mother."
61,"00:04:24,221","00:04:27,725","Fine, then I guess
we'll have to leave it there."
62,"00:04:27,850","00:04:30,978",And continue searching.
63,"00:04:31,854","00:04:33,314",But to be fair...
64,"00:04:34,356","00:04:37,109","It was an entirely different place
the story started."
65,"00:04:37,777","00:04:39,695",I just didn't know it yet.
66,"00:04:40,863","00:04:44,533","'Cause there's a new wheel of fortune
booth at the Christmas Market..."
67,"00:04:45,117","00:04:50,790","- Buy a ticket before I spin the wheel!
- and there was something magical inside."
68,"00:04:52,333","00:04:54,585","Oh, look! The wheel is spinning!"
69,"00:04:55,002","00:04:57,379",I'm ready for someone to win me.
70,"00:04:58,672","00:05:00,925",Let's see if anyone wins this time.
71,"00:05:06,305","00:05:08,599",Does anyone have Blue 14?
72,"00:05:10,434","00:05:13,020",No winner this time either!
73,"00:05:13,145","00:05:15,898","Oh, no! Stupid Blue 14!"
74,"00:05:16,398","00:05:18,192","Oh, I knew it!"
75,"00:05:19,235","00:05:20,277",Well...
76,"00:05:21,737","00:05:27,493","And this is me. Teddy.
A real First Prize!"
77,"00:05:27,576","00:05:32,122","Unfortunately, I'm surrounded by toys
with much too low expectations."
78,"00:05:32,206","00:05:37,086","Because let's be honest:
Who wants to be won by a child?"
79,"00:05:37,211","00:05:41,423","They can't bring you out and show you
everything the world has to offer?"
80,"00:05:41,507","00:05:46,136","Don't get me wrong,
they may be sweet and nice."
81,"00:05:46,220","00:05:50,975","But have you ever seen a child
drive a car or fly a plane?"
82,"00:05:51,058","00:05:53,811",There really isn't much children can do.
83,"00:05:53,936","00:05:59,441","And this fella is sewn
for something much greater."
84,"00:05:59,525","00:06:01,986","Who are you talking to, Teddy?"
85,"00:06:02,069","00:06:04,196",Nobody.
86,"00:06:18,043","00:06:19,211",Merry Christmas!
87,"00:06:19,295","00:06:21,005","Same to you! Take care, now!"
88,"00:06:35,102","00:06:38,022","Are you sure it's okay
for the pointy end to go in first?"
89,"00:06:38,105","00:06:39,398","- Yep.
- Great!"
90,"00:06:41,984","00:06:44,570","Wow, what a lovely tree!"
91,"00:06:44,653","00:06:47,990","We had to search forever.
Mariann was never satisfied."
92,"00:06:48,073","00:06:50,659","But it was worth it.
Here, have a taste."
93,"00:06:50,743","00:06:52,036",Yum!
94,"00:06:53,203","00:06:54,705",And a heart for you!
95,"00:06:55,539","00:06:57,791","- Let's bring it inside, Mariann?
- Yes."
96,"00:07:01,670","00:07:02,922",Come on into the living room.
97,"00:07:03,339","00:07:05,090",And this is my little brother.
98,"00:07:05,174","00:07:08,552",He's always thinking about things.
99,"00:07:08,636","00:07:13,265","Right now, he's wondering
about this whole Santa thing."
100,"00:07:15,100","00:07:18,395","Know what Vigdis said
at the school's Christmas party?"
101,"00:07:18,479","00:07:19,605",No?
102,"00:07:19,688","00:07:21,607",That Santa isn't Santa.
103,"00:07:22,107","00:07:24,777",Really? What did she mean by that?
104,"00:07:24,902","00:07:26,695",That he's something else.
105,"00:07:27,613","00:07:29,198",Then what is he?
106,"00:07:29,865","00:07:31,325",Dads.
107,"00:07:33,243","00:07:37,957","And then there's my mother
who always has an answer for everything."
108,"00:07:38,040","00:07:40,084","Well, sort of."
109,"00:07:40,167","00:07:46,799","No. Vigdis is wrong. Dads don't live
on the North Pole and fly with reindeer."
110,"00:07:46,882","00:07:50,177",They drive cars and live here.
111,"00:07:50,260","00:07:54,932","Vigdis says a lot of strange things.
Come on, let's go decorate the tree."
112,"00:07:55,015","00:08:00,020","None of us knew that this Christmas
would be a very special one."
113,"00:08:00,145","00:08:03,899","Here comes the raffle man!
Everyone back in place!"
114,"00:08:03,983","00:08:06,360",Where are my drumsticks?
115,"00:08:06,443","00:08:07,945","Hurry up, Mr. Spinny!"
116,"00:08:08,028","00:08:12,866","I'm ready, and spinning around
and around and around and around!"
117,"00:08:14,994","00:08:16,537",The dumb have all the fun.
118,"00:08:16,620","00:08:22,126","Round and around, I think he'd be happy
spinning around his entire life."
119,"00:08:22,209","00:08:24,545",But that isn't good enough for me.
120,"00:08:24,628","00:08:28,298","Today I feel that something very special
is going to happen."
121,"00:08:28,716","00:08:34,388",TEDDY'S CHRISTMAS
122,"00:08:35,305","00:08:36,932","- Are you guys ready?
- Yes!"
123,"00:08:38,517","00:08:40,144","- Yes... no!
- Oh!"
124,"00:08:40,686","00:08:42,521",Oh... no!
125,"00:08:42,604","00:08:45,774","Ooooh, yes, so lovely!"
126,"00:08:48,360","00:08:49,570",Lovely!
127,"00:08:51,405","00:08:53,657",Something tells me this is going to be...
128,"00:08:53,741","00:08:56,452","- the best Christmas ever.
- You say that every year."
129,"00:08:56,535","00:08:58,078",Hello!
130,"00:08:58,620","00:09:00,622","- Grandma and Grandpa!
- Here we are!"
131,"00:09:00,706","00:09:01,665",Mom and Dad!
132,"00:09:01,790","00:09:04,585","- And we're staying put!
- Yes, we're staying right here!"
133,"00:09:05,461","00:09:07,963","Hi, Grandpa!"
134,"00:09:08,047","00:09:13,177","So nice to see you!
Is that our rice porridge I can smell?"
135,"00:09:13,302","00:09:14,845",The porridge!
136,"00:09:14,970","00:09:17,931","- The porridge!
- Oh no, I hope it isn't burnt."
137,"00:09:27,941","00:09:30,736","As is the tradition,
no burnt porridge this year either."
138,"00:09:30,819","00:09:32,780",That's comforting.
139,"00:09:32,863","00:09:36,325","All we're missing now is the almond.
Roger?"
140,"00:09:36,408","00:09:39,703",Dad has scalded and readied it.
141,"00:09:40,370","00:09:43,665",But where in the world is it?
142,"00:09:44,166","00:09:47,920",That was the last one we had.
143,"00:09:48,962","00:09:52,132",I didn't know it was that almond.
144,"00:09:52,216","00:09:56,136",You little almond thief!
145,"00:09:56,220","00:09:58,514",I'm going to put you in jail!
146,"00:10:01,475","00:10:04,311",Mariann will take care of this.
147,"00:10:05,104","00:10:08,273","There'll be no Christmas
without an almond in the porridge."
148,"00:10:24,206","00:10:25,749","- Hello!
- Oh, hello!"
149,"00:10:30,796","00:10:33,132","I was just refilling the candy jar,"
150,"00:10:33,215","00:10:35,801","and my hand got...
How can I help you?"
151,"00:10:35,884","00:10:39,513","The thing is...
we're going to eat porridge."
152,"00:10:39,596","00:10:43,267","- Yes?
- And we've run out of almonds."
153,"00:10:43,350","00:10:45,686",Right. That is unacceptable.
154,"00:10:59,199","00:11:02,411",Do you want me to help you?
155,"00:11:02,494","00:11:05,789",If you could just...
156,"00:11:05,914","00:11:09,543",Maybe you could help me by holding this.
157,"00:11:09,668","00:11:12,171",Hang on. Be careful. That's it!
158,"00:11:12,296","00:11:14,047","- Got a good grip?
- Yes."
159,"00:11:14,882","00:11:16,049",It sure is stuck.
160,"00:11:21,680","00:11:23,974","- Are you okay?
- Yes, I'm fine now."
161,"00:11:24,057","00:11:27,603","I got that jar off and won't
have to celebrate Christmas that way."
162,"00:11:27,686","00:11:29,062",What was it you needed?
163,"00:11:29,146","00:11:31,899","- I'm here for almonds.
- Yes, that's right."
164,"00:11:33,025","00:11:36,403","- How many will it be?
- I only need one."
165,"00:11:36,486","00:11:37,613",Only one?
166,"00:11:41,658","00:11:44,286","- Here you go!
- How much will that be?"
167,"00:11:44,411","00:11:48,540","You know what? You're today's hero
so you get it for free. Merry Christmas!"
168,"00:11:48,624","00:11:51,251","- Free?
- Yes, so keep your penny."
169,"00:11:51,335","00:11:53,128",Thank you! Merry Christmas!
170,"00:11:53,253","00:11:54,588",Merry Christmas!
171,"00:12:03,972","00:12:05,098",No!
172,"00:12:08,685","00:12:10,437","- Hi, Mariann!
- Hi, Mariann!"
173,"00:12:10,520","00:12:13,440","- There's a Christmas market!
- Have they got candy there too?"
174,"00:12:13,523","00:12:14,650",Yes!
175,"00:12:14,733","00:12:16,443",Christmas market?
176,"00:12:46,890","00:12:51,353","Ma'am, taste this incredible
Christmas ham!"
177,"00:13:01,405","00:13:04,074","- Okay, say ""cheese""!

192,"00:14:04,926","00:14:08,472","Want to try your luck?
It only costs one penny."
193,"00:14:11,892","00:14:12,893",Let's see...
194,"00:14:13,977","00:14:16,271","- I think she saw you.
- So what?"
195,"00:14:16,355","00:14:20,525","She only has one penny,
so the odds of her winning are tiny."
196,"00:14:22,652","00:14:23,653",That one!
197,"00:14:25,364","00:14:30,619","The right color wins third prize,
the right number wins second prize."
198,"00:14:30,702","00:14:34,623","Having both the right color and number
wins first prize."
199,"00:14:35,040","00:14:36,249","- Are you ready?
- Yes."
200,"00:14:55,435","00:14:56,645",But...
201,"00:14:57,354","00:14:58,730",That's me!
202,"00:14:59,272","00:15:00,816",Really?
203,"00:15:00,941","00:15:03,110",I want that teddy bear.
204,"00:15:03,235","00:15:05,278",Very well. Let me just check...
205,"00:15:05,404","00:15:07,948",She won you! She won you!
206,"00:15:10,242","00:15:11,410",No...
207,"00:15:11,493","00:15:13,370",She didn't.
208,"00:15:20,961","00:15:24,297",White 1? You must have been mistaken.
209,"00:15:24,381","00:15:26,425","No, it stopped on White 1."
210,"00:15:26,925","00:15:28,260",I'm afraid it didn't.
211,"00:15:28,385","00:15:31,471","Yes, you have to believe me.
It stopped on White 1."
212,"00:15:31,596","00:15:34,975","I can't give you the first prize
when you didn't win it."
213,"00:15:35,100","00:15:39,062","- That's not fair!
- But I'll give you a consolation prize."
214,"00:15:40,188","00:15:43,066","Wait here.
I'll come back as fast as I can."
215,"00:15:44,025","00:15:45,318",Excuse me!
216,"00:15:45,402","00:15:48,780","- It's really bustling here!
- Yes, and at a fast pace!"
217,"00:16:06,298","00:16:10,010","- Oh, that was close!
- Teddy!"
218,"00:16:10,093","00:16:14,264","What was wrong with her?
She seemed sweet and nice and..."
219,"00:16:14,389","00:16:20,395","Sure, absolutely. But I've said it before:
Children hardly have any money."
220,"00:16:20,479","00:16:24,316","I saw that she only had one penny,
and you can't have much fun for that."
221,"00:16:24,399","00:16:28,278","What can you get for one penny?
One ride on the carousel??"
222,"00:16:28,361","00:16:32,324","And we'd have to walk home.
No way she could afford the bus."
223,"00:16:32,407","00:16:35,827","You can get too much of carousels, too.
One turn can be enough,"
224,"00:16:35,911","00:16:38,288",if you do it with someone you're fond of.
225,"00:16:38,371","00:16:40,457",Someone you're fond of? Right.
226,"00:16:40,540","00:16:43,168","Try buying an airplane ticket
with nothing but air and love!"
227,"00:16:43,251","00:16:45,086","- An airplane ticket?
- Yes!"
228,"00:16:45,170","00:16:48,131","Yes. I'm a ""First Prize Teddy Bear""."
229,"00:16:48,256","00:16:50,926",You're first and foremost a cuddly toy.
230,"00:16:51,051","00:16:53,303",I'm meant for greater things!
231,"00:16:53,428","00:16:56,181","I'm going to see all the places
on these postcards."
232,"00:16:56,264","00:16:58,350","Those cool towers in countries
without color."
233,"00:16:58,475","00:17:01,311","I'm going to talk to those
strange four-legged bears."
234,"00:17:01,394","00:17:03,480",And I'm going to climb up on that statue.
235,"00:17:03,563","00:17:06,441",So whoever wins me has to have money.
236,"00:17:06,525","00:17:09,027",You'll never be satisfied.
237,"00:17:09,110","00:17:12,948",As the old saying I just made up goes:
238,"00:17:13,031","00:17:16,076",Rich teddy bears... are happy.
239,"00:17:16,159","00:17:20,747","""And then it was Christmas, and everyone
got what they..."" What's it say there?"
240,"00:17:21,206","00:17:23,708","- ""Wished for"".
- ""...wished for""."
241,"00:17:24,334","00:17:27,504",Everyone got what they wished for.
242,"00:17:27,587","00:17:29,881",They sure were lucky.
243,"00:17:33,176","00:17:36,429",Why doesn't Santa bring all the gifts?
244,"00:17:36,555","00:17:39,516","He didn't bring the ski jumper
I wished for last year."
245,"00:17:39,599","00:17:41,768",It was just sitting under the tree.
246,"00:17:42,602","00:17:43,603",Right.
247,"00:17:45,188","00:17:47,190","- Mariann?
- I don't have time!"
248,"00:17:59,119","00:18:00,328",Useless.
249,"00:18:00,453","00:18:03,290","Come out, you little coin!"
250,"00:18:07,294","00:18:08,295",Yes.
251,"00:18:15,552","00:18:16,928",A button.
252,"00:18:18,096","00:18:19,097",Mom!
253,"00:18:19,639","00:18:23,393","Mariann, I had some questions
for you regarding..."
254,"00:18:23,893","00:18:25,604","Not now, Grandpa. Mom?"
255,"00:18:25,687","00:18:28,607",Did you get the almond? Thank you.
256,"00:18:28,690","00:18:31,860","- May I have a penny or a bit more?
- What for?"
257,"00:18:31,943","00:18:34,904","I thought I won a teddy bear
at the Christmas market, but nope."
258,"00:18:35,030","00:18:37,490","Slow down, Mariann.
Take it from the start."
259,"00:18:37,574","00:18:39,909","I don't have time!
Someone else might win him"
260,"00:18:40,035","00:18:42,704","and he's the cutest teddy bear
I've ever seen."
261,"00:18:42,787","00:18:47,542","He's alive and his name will be Teddy,
and we'll be so happy together!"
262,"00:18:47,626","00:18:48,752",Really?
263,"00:18:48,877","00:18:50,712","Oh, please!"
264,"00:18:50,795","00:18:53,173",Now it's a teddy bear that's alive.
265,"00:18:53,256","00:18:56,635","Well, the rule in this house
is that in order to get money,"
266,"00:18:56,718","00:18:58,386",you have to work for it.
267,"00:18:58,470","00:19:01,473","If you clean your room,
I'll give you a penny."
268,"00:19:03,224","00:19:05,644",Can I get the penny now and clean later?
269,"00:19:05,727","00:19:09,022","No. Work first, and then you'll get paid."
270,"00:19:09,105","00:19:11,024","- Fine!
- That's how society works."
271,"00:19:11,107","00:19:15,612","I guess I'll go out
and fetch some more firewood."
272,"00:19:19,949","00:19:21,284",What a mess!
273,"00:19:45,308","00:19:46,559",Finished!
274,"00:19:52,107","00:19:54,359","Well, will you look at this!"
275,"00:19:55,026","00:19:58,154","Your room looks great.
And you did it so fast."
276,"00:19:58,238","00:19:59,239",Here!
277,"00:19:59,322","00:20:02,617","- Can I get a penny now?
- Sure. Here you go."
278,"00:20:02,701","00:20:03,702",Thank you.
279,"00:20:04,577","00:20:06,204","- Bring Nils with you.
- Sure thing."
280,"00:20:12,419","00:20:13,461",Mariann!
281,"00:20:13,545","00:20:14,546",Come on!
282,"00:20:17,924","00:20:20,552",You can have a consolation prize.
283,"00:20:20,635","00:20:22,053",Thanks a lot!
284,"00:20:22,137","00:20:23,138",Goodbye!
285,"00:20:23,930","00:20:26,224",No more for today.
286,"00:20:26,307","00:20:28,184",That's it. Great.
287,"00:20:31,604","00:20:35,358","And who do we have here?
A gentleman ready to try his luck?"
288,"00:20:35,442","00:20:37,694",How many tickets can I get for this?
289,"00:20:38,194","00:20:40,196",A hundred?
290,"00:20:40,697","00:20:43,950","That gets you a hundred tickets.
Here you go."
291,"00:20:44,659","00:20:46,703",Mr. Spinny! Mr. Spinny!
292,"00:20:46,786","00:20:48,163",What is it?
293,"00:20:48,246","00:20:52,333",Look at all the money that man has!
294,"00:20:53,543","00:20:54,753",Good luck!
295,"00:20:57,922","00:21:01,676","It's happening. It's happening!
I can feel it!"
296,"00:21:01,760","00:21:03,720","I mean, it's weird."
297,"00:21:03,803","00:21:07,223","I got the ski jumper
that I wrote to Santa that I wanted,"
298,"00:21:07,307","00:21:10,977","but I got it from Dad, not Santa."
299,"00:21:11,102","00:21:16,357","You know what, little brother?
Let's just focus a little bit."
300,"00:21:19,486","00:21:21,696","- Look, the wheel stopped on number 3.
- Yeah."
301,"00:21:21,780","00:21:23,740","- That's only one number off.
- What?"
302,"00:21:23,823","00:21:25,033","- Should I do it?
- Hm?"
303,"00:21:25,116","00:21:28,203","- Should I do it?
- Yes! Yeah, do it!"
304,"00:21:28,286","00:21:31,206","No, no, don't do it!
Or yes or no or..."
305,"00:21:31,289","00:21:32,916","- Farewell, wheel of fortune!
- He did it."
306,"00:21:33,041","00:21:34,167",I forgot my glasses.
307,"00:21:34,250","00:21:37,128","You had Blue 2,
but the wheel didn't stop there."
308,"00:21:37,212","00:21:39,923",It stopped on Blue... 2.
309,"00:21:41,674","00:21:46,095","Which means you won!
So, what would you like?"
310,"00:21:46,221","00:21:48,431","Or maybe Vigdis was right,"
311,"00:21:48,515","00:21:51,643",that Santa and Dad are the same.
312,"00:21:51,726","00:21:55,855","I mean, not the same,
but that Santa doesn't exist and..."
313,"00:21:55,980","00:22:00,902","Mariann, this is important!
My head is about to explode!"
314,"00:22:00,985","00:22:04,239","Listen, we're on an important mission."
315,"00:22:04,364","00:22:05,782",Excuse me!
316,"00:22:07,534","00:22:08,535","One ticket, please!"
317,"00:22:11,246","00:22:13,331",But where's the teddy bear?
318,"00:22:13,414","00:22:16,835",A man just won him a few minutes ago.
319,"00:22:17,877","00:22:19,379",Huh? Really?
320,"00:22:20,839","00:22:24,634","- I just went home to get some money...
- And then someone else won him."
321,"00:22:24,759","00:22:27,262",But that teddy bear was mine.
322,"00:22:27,345","00:22:30,306","Technically speaking,
he wasn't yours but try again,"
323,"00:22:30,431","00:22:34,602","there are many other nice prizes
such as this lovely spinning top?"
324,"00:22:34,727","00:22:37,438",I don't want a spinning top!
325,"00:22:37,522","00:22:39,899",I want the teddy bear.
326,"00:22:47,740","00:22:49,868","- What did he look like?
- Who?"
327,"00:22:49,951","00:22:51,327",The man who won the teddy bear.
328,"00:22:51,452","00:22:55,290","He had a hat and a green coat.
And a backpack, I believe."
329,"00:22:55,331","00:22:57,041",But he didn't have glasses.
330,"00:23:00,879","00:23:05,800",A hat. A green coat. And no glasses.
331,"00:23:05,884","00:23:08,011",No glasses?
332,"00:23:09,387","00:23:10,763","Come, little brother!"
333,"00:23:14,225","00:23:15,560",Look!
334,"00:23:21,524","00:23:23,776","- You have glasses.
- Well, shouldn't I?"
335,"00:23:25,361","00:23:27,113","Look, a backpack!"
336,"00:23:45,256","00:23:46,925",Pickles!
337,"00:23:49,761","00:23:51,804",What are you doing?
338,"00:23:52,388","00:23:54,766","- Sorry, wrong backpack. Merry Christmas!
- Merry Christmas!"
339,"00:23:54,849","00:23:57,143","- There's a man over there!
- Where?"
340,"00:23:57,226","00:23:59,520",With a green coat and a backpack!
341,"00:23:59,604","00:24:01,648",What are you waiting for? Come on!
342,"00:24:05,276","00:24:07,195","- Little Brother!
- What are you doing?"
343,"00:24:08,529","00:24:11,574","You must be quiet!
Follow me!"
344,"00:24:15,662","00:24:18,581","What a nice dog you are!
Are you here all alone?"
345,"00:24:18,665","00:24:22,377","We don't have time for that nonsense.
Come on! Hurry up!"
346,"00:24:25,838","00:24:27,340",Be quiet!
347,"00:24:38,559","00:24:40,603",Stop it! I can see you!
348,"00:24:48,194","00:24:49,195",Come on.
349,"00:24:49,320","00:24:52,907","Didn't Mom and Dad say
we shouldn't go here alone?"
350,"00:24:52,991","00:24:56,703","You aren't alone, you have me.
Come here, I'll help you up."
351,"00:24:56,786","00:24:57,996",Okay.
352,"00:25:03,584","00:25:04,711",What do you see?
353,"00:25:05,586","00:25:06,879",I don't know.
354,"00:25:07,005","00:25:09,716",You must know what you're seeing.
355,"00:25:09,841","00:25:11,551",Hang on.
356,"00:25:11,634","00:25:14,887","He's putting a gift
on top of the corner cabinet."
357,"00:25:15,680","00:25:19,475","That present is Teddy.
I have to go in and get him."
358,"00:25:19,976","00:25:22,103",Are you going to steal a teddy bear?!
359,"00:25:22,186","00:25:24,355",It isn't just any old teddy bear.
360,"00:25:24,480","00:25:26,399",I think it's alive.
361,"00:25:28,860","00:25:29,861",Duck!
362,"00:25:41,372","00:25:43,875","- The window is open.
- So?"
363,"00:25:44,000","00:25:48,588","- Shh, be quiet!
- No! Can't we just go home?"
364,"00:25:52,925","00:25:55,011",Are you stealing rice pudding too?
365,"00:26:03,394","00:26:05,646","- Watch out!
- Okay."
366,"00:26:37,136","00:26:38,137",Shh!
367,"00:26:41,307","00:26:42,308",Come on!
368,"00:27:03,955","00:27:05,289","Oh, no!"
369,"00:27:07,041","00:27:08,793",What have you done?
370,"00:27:10,002","00:27:11,587","No, no, no, no!"
371,"00:27:18,719","00:27:20,096",Hello?
372,"00:27:22,098","00:27:24,475","- What happened?
- Be quiet!"
373,"00:27:24,559","00:27:26,227",Wasn't Teddy there?
374,"00:27:26,853","00:27:28,062",Hey!
375,"00:27:30,273","00:27:31,482",Hey!
376,"00:27:31,983","00:27:33,442",Did you see them?
377,"00:27:44,078","00:27:46,497",It was the man from the store.
378,"00:27:49,667","00:27:52,962","Can't we just go home
and eat porridge? Huh?"
379,"00:27:55,131","00:27:58,509","Yes. Yes, let's do that."
380,"00:27:58,593","00:28:00,428",And forget all about this.
381,"00:28:00,511","00:28:04,807","Let's not say anything
about this to anyone. Please."
382,"00:28:05,266","00:28:08,477","That teddy bear probably
wasn't alive anyway."
383,"00:28:17,862","00:28:19,488",Hello?
384,"00:28:19,947","00:28:22,366",I can hardly wait any longer.
385,"00:28:25,203","00:28:30,166","Can I come out?
Old man? Rich guy!"
386,"00:28:31,626","00:28:34,086","Well, I'm coming out now."
387,"00:28:34,170","00:28:38,758","Why is this so hard?
This backpack isn't very practical."
388,"00:28:38,841","00:28:41,302",It's impossible to open from the inside.
389,"00:28:47,975","00:28:50,269",It sure is dark in here...
390,"00:28:50,895","00:28:52,480",And dusty.
391,"00:28:56,567","00:28:57,568",Is this...?
392,"00:28:58,236","00:28:59,654",Hello?
393,"00:29:07,036","00:29:10,581",What kind of place is this? Hello?
394,"00:29:11,624","00:29:13,084",Is anyone here?
395,"00:29:13,167","00:29:14,293",Hello?
396,"00:29:17,922","00:29:19,131",Hello?
397,"00:29:21,884","00:29:24,470","- Hello?
- I asked if anyone was here."
398,"00:29:24,595","00:29:25,596",Yes!
399,"00:29:26,639","00:29:28,432",A cuddly toy!
400,"00:29:29,350","00:29:31,102","No, no, no, no, no... no!"
401,"00:29:31,227","00:29:37,316","Come here, cuddle, cuddle, cuddle!"
402,"00:29:37,400","00:29:38,401",Huh?
403,"00:29:39,527","00:29:43,072","Ohhhh! Cuddly, cuddly, cuddly!"
404,"00:29:43,197","00:29:45,700","What's a teddy bear like you
doing in a dump like this?"
405,"00:29:45,783","00:29:48,452","- Excuse me. Bolla!
- Teddy."
406,"00:29:48,536","00:29:51,998","You're handsome! Are all bears shiny
or do you use conditioner?"
407,"00:29:52,081","00:29:55,543","You're so soft and fluffy
and have such long arms!"
408,"00:29:55,626","00:29:57,837",And you're tall... tall and beige!
409,"00:29:57,920","00:29:59,255","- It's a pleasure!
- Is it?"
410,"00:29:59,338","00:30:02,717","- Want to see my dust bunny collection?
- No, I..."
411,"00:30:02,800","00:30:06,012","- I have one I named George.
- George?"
412,"00:30:06,137","00:30:09,724","- Nice guy. Real cozy...
- Let go of me. I can't..."
413,"00:30:09,807","00:30:11,309",Let go of me!
414,"00:30:13,811","00:30:15,563","Hey, open the door!"
415,"00:30:15,646","00:30:16,939",What in the world was that?
416,"00:30:38,878","00:30:40,546",Did you get the almond?
417,"00:30:49,055","00:30:52,266","Oh, that joke's getting a little old!"
418,"00:30:52,933","00:30:54,894","You like fooling people, Dad."
419,"00:30:56,062","00:30:57,355",What do you mean by that?
420,"00:30:57,438","00:30:58,689",Nothing.
421,"00:31:10,826","00:31:13,037","You're not kidding too, are you?"
422,"00:31:16,290","00:31:17,708",Congratulations!
423,"00:31:17,833","00:31:19,794","- This year it was your turn!
- Yes!"
424,"00:31:19,877","00:31:21,587",That means you get the marzipan pig.
425,"00:31:21,670","00:31:23,130",Yay!
426,"00:31:23,255","00:31:26,050","Too bad you won the pig,
since you don't like marzipan."
427,"00:31:26,175","00:31:29,470","- Guess I'll take it instead...
- No! We like marzipan!"
428,"00:31:29,553","00:31:31,889","- Can I have a piece?
- Fine, I'll give you a piece of the butt."
429,"00:31:32,014","00:31:33,140",A butt bite.
430,"00:31:34,225","00:31:38,020","That's probably Mrs. Jacobsen.
She borrowed my whisk."
431,"00:31:38,896","00:31:41,982","I thought the porridge was delicious,
even though I didn't get the almond."
432,"00:31:42,066","00:31:43,275",Mariann?
433,"00:31:45,653","00:31:47,279",Can you come here?
434,"00:32:09,176","00:32:10,177",Good evening.
435,"00:32:10,261","00:32:11,470",Good evening.
436,"00:32:12,430","00:32:14,640",What's going on here?
437,"00:32:15,599","00:32:17,852",Maybe Mariann knows the answer to that?
438,"00:32:30,281","00:32:32,032",Alive!
439,"00:32:48,549","00:32:50,176",My own daughter...
440,"00:32:53,345","00:32:54,889",is a burglar.
441,"00:33:07,776","00:33:13,699","You must understand that you can't
go into other people's houses like that?"
442,"00:33:14,366","00:33:15,784",I'm sorry.
443,"00:33:19,747","00:33:23,667","What were you thinking?
What were you thinking?"
444,"00:33:23,751","00:33:26,879",That teddy bear was alive.
445,"00:33:37,598","00:33:39,266",You know what?
446,"00:33:40,768","00:33:44,855","This is the last time
I want to hear about trolls"
447,"00:33:45,731","00:33:47,233",or squirrels...
448,"00:33:47,316","00:33:49,485",or teddy bears that are alive.
449,"00:33:49,610","00:33:52,112",Do you hear me? Enough!
450,"00:33:53,822","00:33:56,617","Go to bed with Nils, Mariann."
451,"00:33:56,700","00:33:58,619",Aren't we going to play any games?
452,"00:33:59,745","00:34:01,539","No, not tonight."
453,"00:34:02,998","00:34:06,794","Just do as I say.
Off to bed."
454,"00:34:32,278","00:34:34,446","Okay, that didn't go so well."
455,"00:34:35,281","00:34:37,741","Fine, I guess I can be a bit too much."
456,"00:34:37,825","00:34:40,828","Think, Bolla, think!"
457,"00:34:40,911","00:34:43,622","Did you come on a little too strong?
Yes, I think so."
458,"00:34:43,706","00:34:46,083","A little desperate, maybe.
Let's try again."
459,"00:34:46,166","00:34:48,794","A little more low-key,
a little less buffoon."
460,"00:34:51,672","00:34:55,843","Oh me oh my,
There comes the man I love"
461,"00:34:55,926","00:34:58,512",There comes tango for two
462,"00:34:59,847","00:35:04,018","And across the floor
Comes the man I fear most,"
463,"00:35:04,101","00:35:06,729",it's Gunnar from Mo
464,"00:35:07,646","00:35:10,649",So we dance tango for two
465,"00:35:10,733","00:35:14,862","And no one can dance
Like old Gunnar from Mo"
466,"00:35:14,945","00:35:17,990",Except for the two of us!
467,"00:35:18,657","00:35:22,328",Zoo Be Zoo Be Zoo
468,"00:35:22,411","00:35:25,497","Zoo Be Zoo Be Zoo
Zoo Be Zoo, Zoo Be Zoo"
469,"00:35:25,623","00:35:29,209",Means that I love you! Ah!
470,"00:35:29,335","00:35:31,462","Come on, join in, Teddy."
471,"00:35:31,545","00:35:34,632",Get carried away by the Balkan rhythms.
472,"00:35:35,132","00:35:36,967",I don't feel up for it.
473,"00:35:41,388","00:35:44,558","No, not that either.
How about this?"
474,"00:35:50,564","00:35:51,774",And then the bell...
475,"00:35:53,442","00:35:58,113",What would life be without you...
476,"00:35:58,197","00:36:01,116",There we go. Pirouette and everything!
477,"00:36:02,534","00:36:06,497",Life is lovely as an adventure.
478,"00:36:06,538","00:36:09,541",Listen to the lyrics!
479,"00:36:09,625","00:36:13,170","...conquer this world,
come what may..."
480,"00:36:13,962","00:36:17,383",I don't think I can...
481,"00:36:29,687","00:36:32,064","I should have understood
that this wouldn't work."
482,"00:36:32,147","00:36:33,357",I'm sorry.
483,"00:36:36,318","00:36:38,946","Who wants to dance
with a hedgehog, anyway?"
484,"00:36:41,365","00:36:42,574",Sorry!
485,"00:37:28,078","00:37:29,079",Hey...
486,"00:37:30,038","00:37:32,249",It's just a little too much sometimes.
487,"00:37:33,375","00:37:37,296","And this time it went too far, right?"
488,"00:37:44,219","00:37:47,765",I know. But it's over now.
489,"00:37:48,891","00:37:50,309",What do you mean by over?
490,"00:37:50,851","00:37:53,645",I'll never imagine anything again.
491,"00:37:53,729","00:37:58,358","From now on, it's over.
I'll be a different person. I promise."
492,"00:38:04,114","00:38:05,407",You...
493,"00:38:07,367","00:38:12,581","who sees trolls under the woodshed
and squirrels in the Christmas tree."
494,"00:38:13,373","00:38:16,502",You and your vivid imagination...
495,"00:38:16,585","00:38:19,296",That's what's so wonderful about you.
496,"00:38:20,130","00:38:22,424",And I know your father thinks so too.
497,"00:38:23,050","00:38:27,137","Never be anyone but who you are, Mariann."
498,"00:38:29,389","00:38:31,642","But you're allowed to think twice
now and then."
499,"00:38:33,685","00:38:35,187",It's okay to make mistakes.
500,"00:38:35,312","00:38:38,607",Your father and I also make mistakes.
501,"00:38:38,690","00:38:42,569","Especially your father.
And then things get a little difficult."
502,"00:38:44,988","00:38:46,698",But just remember...
503,"00:38:46,824","00:38:50,118","even though everything went wrong today,"
504,"00:38:50,202","00:38:52,538",tomorrow is another day.
505,"00:38:53,163","00:38:56,542","- Just like in that song.
- What song?"
506,"00:39:06,093","00:39:11,348","There was a young boy once
who cried so brokenly"
507,"00:39:12,140","00:39:17,354","He wanted to draw Babylon
but his teacher told him nay"
508,"00:39:17,896","00:39:25,070","He scribbled stupid colors,
his day was lost in sullen tears"
509,"00:39:25,153","00:39:28,949",But then the wind rose
510,"00:39:29,032","00:39:33,704",through the pines at end of day:
511,"00:39:34,913","00:39:42,379","You shall have a day tomorrow,
that clean and unused stands"
512,"00:39:42,462","00:39:47,175","With blank white sheets
and fresh new crayons too"
513,"00:39:48,260","00:39:54,308","And you can then correct them,
errors of the day before"
514,"00:39:54,433","00:39:59,479","And you'll face tomorrow's
evening with joy"
515,"00:40:01,356","00:40:07,237","And if you cannot do it,
and all is just as sad"
516,"00:40:07,321","00:40:13,702","Still the pine-wind shall comfort you
just as now:"
517,"00:40:14,202","00:40:21,043","You shall have a day tomorrow,
that clean and unused stands"
518,"00:40:21,126","00:40:26,089","With blank white sheets
and fresh new crayons too"
519,"00:40:31,178","00:40:33,972",Bollen? Was that your name?
520,"00:40:35,349","00:40:37,768",My name is Bolla!
521,"00:40:37,851","00:40:41,647","Well, anyway, I'm sorry.
I don't know what I said or did..."
522,"00:40:41,772","00:40:45,901","Shhh! You don't have to say it.
I already know."
523,"00:40:45,984","00:40:47,194",Know what?
524,"00:40:47,277","00:40:52,157",I know that I'm not cuddlesome.
525,"00:40:52,574","00:40:53,617",Cuddlesome?
526,"00:40:53,700","00:41:01,667","Yes. Cuddlesome. Huggable. Pamper-worthy.
Tousle-worthy. Call it what you want."
527,"00:41:02,084","00:41:07,464",I'm a hedgehog. With quills.
528,"00:41:07,589","00:41:08,590",Okay.
529,"00:41:08,674","00:41:10,926",No one wants to cuddle with a hedgehog.
530,"00:41:13,136","00:41:16,014","Cuddle with...?
I'm a little confused here."
531,"00:41:16,098","00:41:20,060","I started my day at a Christmas market
and now I'm here,"
532,"00:41:20,143","00:41:21,937",and I don't even know where I am.
533,"00:41:22,020","00:41:25,107","I'm trying to understand,
but I don't know what you mean."
534,"00:41:25,232","00:41:27,901",What's a cuddle?
535,"00:41:31,446","00:41:33,073",Did I say something wrong?
536,"00:41:33,782","00:41:36,159",You don't know what it means to cuddle?
537,"00:41:36,243","00:41:38,286","No, I have no idea."
538,"00:41:38,412","00:41:42,624","My golly, you haven't understood anything!"
539,"00:41:43,166","00:41:45,252",You don't even know what you are.
540,"00:41:45,335","00:41:48,964","Yes, I do. I'm an adventurer.
I'm going to experience the world..."
541,"00:41:49,047","00:41:52,175","No, no, no, no, you see...!"
542,"00:41:52,300","00:41:56,430",You... you are a cuddly toy.
543,"00:41:56,513","00:41:58,265",There's that word again.
544,"00:41:58,348","00:42:00,767","Can't you just tell me
what ""cuddle"" means?"
545,"00:42:00,851","00:42:05,814","Sure. Look, you're very, very soft."
546,"00:42:05,897","00:42:07,899",Just feel your belly.
547,"00:42:07,983","00:42:10,402",Okay. So?
548,"00:42:10,819","00:42:12,320",And your butt too.
549,"00:42:12,821","00:42:15,115","Hey, that's not okay!"
550,"00:42:17,576","00:42:20,954","Hey, you've actually never cuddled before."
551,"00:42:21,038","00:42:22,748",No.
552,"00:42:22,831","00:42:27,044","Come here, let me show you.
It's the best thing in the entire world."
553,"00:42:27,127","00:42:30,630",Take your hand and place it there.
554,"00:42:30,714","00:42:33,091","- Like this?
- Right there, yes."
555,"00:42:34,217","00:42:37,637","- Yes?
- Oh, you're good at this. And so soft."
556,"00:42:37,721","00:42:41,933","So are you.
Your quills are very soft."
557,"00:42:42,017","00:42:45,353","- Really?
- Yes, they are."
558,"00:42:50,525","00:42:53,445","So, is this what you mean by cuddling?"
559,"00:42:55,739","00:42:57,491",This is cuddling.
560,"00:43:30,315","00:43:31,942","Merry Christmas, Mariann!"
561,"00:43:43,161","00:43:44,996",This one is for Mom.
562,"00:44:01,513","00:44:03,515",Who is this one from?
563,"00:44:07,769","00:44:12,607","Oh, hi! Did you know
that this one is for me?"
564,"00:44:13,817","00:44:18,572","And this big, heavy one here is for you."
565,"00:44:19,614","00:44:23,034","But there are none here
from Grandma and Grandpa."
566,"00:44:23,118","00:44:24,619",Want to help me look for them?
567,"00:44:24,703","00:44:27,581","Grandpa is a master
at hiding Christmas gifts."
568,"00:44:27,706","00:44:30,083",You'll never find them.
569,"00:44:30,167","00:44:33,712","You forget that I'm a master
at finding Christmas gifts."
570,"00:44:33,837","00:44:35,714",But do as you please!
571,"00:44:39,009","00:44:40,427","Hi, Dad!"
572,"00:44:40,510","00:44:41,595",Hi!
573,"00:44:42,095","00:44:44,181","- Good morning.
- Good morning."
574,"00:44:44,764","00:44:49,978","Your brother is about to go crazy
with all those gifts."
575,"00:44:51,479","00:44:56,026","But you know what you have to do before
Christmas Eve can begin, right?"
576,"00:44:56,109","00:44:59,487","Yes. I have to apologize to Paula
for breaking her gift."
577,"00:44:59,571","00:45:03,658","That's right. Go do it right now,
and get it over with."
578,"00:45:06,036","00:45:08,121","- Bye.
- Bye."
579,"00:45:34,606","00:45:37,234",This one was funny:
580,"00:45:37,943","00:45:40,612","""Can I get a dog for Christmas, Dad?"""
581,"00:45:40,695","00:45:43,907","""No, this year we're having a pork roast,
as always."""
582,"00:45:44,532","00:45:46,785",It wasn't that funny!
583,"00:45:47,786","00:45:53,124","Here's another: ""A boy crashed into
a fir tree while skiing. He cried out:"
584,"00:45:53,208","00:45:56,211","Tree against one isn't fair.""
Funny, eh?"
585,"00:46:20,277","00:46:21,528",Hi?
586,"00:46:22,696","00:46:23,780",Hi.
587,"00:46:24,990","00:46:28,576","I'm sorry I ruined your present.
I didn't mean to."
588,"00:46:28,660","00:46:30,161",It's okay.
589,"00:46:30,245","00:46:31,329",Are you sure?
590,"00:46:33,498","00:46:36,459","Dad said it was because
you thought a teddy bear..."
591,"00:46:36,584","00:46:37,794",was alive.
592,"00:46:37,877","00:46:41,172","Not exactly alive, but... Here."
593,"00:46:43,258","00:46:44,634",What is this?
594,"00:46:45,427","00:46:47,095",It's for you.
595,"00:46:47,178","00:46:50,807","Well, it was for me,
but now it's for you."
596,"00:46:51,850","00:46:55,854","Are you sure?
But what if it's something you wanted?"
597,"00:46:55,937","00:46:59,482","The only thing I want
is that you and I are friends,"
598,"00:46:59,566","00:47:01,693",and that you have a nice Christmas.
599,"00:47:02,360","00:47:07,907","My birthday is in January and I'll
probably get something nice then too."
600,"00:47:08,033","00:47:11,786","But I need to get going.
It's Christmas, so Merry Christmas!"
601,"00:47:11,911","00:47:13,121",Merry Christmas!
602,"00:47:13,872","00:47:14,873","- Hi!
- Hi!"
603,"00:47:14,956","00:47:17,250","- Merry Christmas!
- Merry Christmas to you!"
604,"00:47:24,132","00:47:26,176",The wheel of fortune is spinning!
605,"00:47:39,397","00:47:43,276",But... that's me.
606,"00:47:43,401","00:47:45,278",Then I want that teddy bear.
607,"00:47:50,158","00:47:53,328","No, it stopped on White 1.
That's not fair!"
608,"00:47:53,411","00:47:55,622",You're first and foremost a cuddly toy.
609,"00:47:55,705","00:47:56,915",Teddy?
610,"00:47:57,374","00:47:58,375",Teddy!
611,"00:47:58,458","00:48:00,877","Oh, no! I've ruined everything!"
612,"00:48:00,960","00:48:02,921",You haven't ruined anything.
613,"00:48:03,004","00:48:06,674",But you were right. I am a cuddly toy.
614,"00:48:08,093","00:48:12,138","And that girl from the Christmas market,
she's the one I belong with."
615,"00:48:15,892","00:48:17,435","Watch out, Bolla!"
616,"00:48:17,519","00:48:18,520",Let's see. Over here...
617,"00:48:18,645","00:48:20,313",So you've met a little girl?
618,"00:48:20,397","00:48:23,483","- That's fantastic news, Teddy!
- Look out!"
619,"00:48:29,197","00:48:30,740",That looks pretty high.
620,"00:48:30,824","00:48:35,912","No, this will be easy-peasy.
Let's see... Okay, you try first."
621,"00:48:35,995","00:48:37,163",Alright.
622,"00:48:39,040","00:48:42,252","Do you think there's a child
for me there too?"
623,"00:48:42,335","00:48:45,588","Bolla, where there's one child,
there are always more."
624,"00:48:45,672","00:48:49,509","But do you think that girl
has a sister or maybe a brother?"
625,"00:48:49,592","00:48:52,595",And do you think they have two rooms?
626,"00:48:52,720","00:48:57,434","Then you could visit me at night,
and I could visit you if you want..."
627,"00:48:57,559","00:48:59,310","And I could teach you
how to dance paso doble..."
628,"00:48:59,436","00:49:01,396",I could go for a third cousin too.
629,"00:49:01,521","00:49:05,233","I thought that meant there were three
of them, but there's only one..."
630,"00:49:06,484","00:49:07,902","- Holy moly!
- Watch out!"
631,"00:49:07,986","00:49:09,821","- Are you okay?
- Yes."
632,"00:49:09,904","00:49:11,114",Good.
633,"00:49:19,956","00:49:22,250",Are you sure this is the only way out?
634,"00:49:22,333","00:49:25,920","Yes, I've checked every nook and cranny."
635,"00:49:26,004","00:49:27,088",Okay.
636,"00:49:31,426","00:49:32,969",This is extremely high.
637,"00:49:35,263","00:49:37,474","The key is to maintain focus
and not look down."
638,"00:49:37,557","00:49:39,851",The trick is to not look down!
639,"00:49:40,351","00:49:41,478",What did you say?
640,"00:49:47,025","00:49:48,026",It's so high!
641,"00:49:48,109","00:49:50,778",I said the trick is not to look down!
642,"00:49:50,862","00:49:54,782","- I don't need any more tricks now.
- Okay, fine."
643,"00:49:55,492","00:49:57,494",It's now... Or never.
644,"00:50:00,288","00:50:03,041","Freedom, here I come!"
645,"00:50:11,299","00:50:13,635","No, no, no, no..."
646,"00:50:17,263","00:50:19,557","You're hanging right above
the mousetrap!"
647,"00:50:19,641","00:50:20,642",Thanks.
648,"00:50:24,354","00:50:25,563","Oh, no."
649,"00:50:41,621","00:50:44,040",No gifts here...
650,"00:50:59,556","00:51:01,099",Nothing here...
651,"00:51:04,143","00:51:05,895","Oh, no!"
652,"00:51:15,947","00:51:17,156","Hey, you!"
653,"00:51:25,373","00:51:27,375",Don't move!
654,"00:51:40,013","00:51:45,852","You know how you told me
that we always have to tell the truth."
655,"00:51:46,686","00:51:47,770",Yes.
656,"00:51:47,854","00:51:49,939",So now it's your turn.
657,"00:51:50,815","00:51:52,859",My turn to what?
658,"00:51:52,942","00:51:55,695",Are you Santa?
659,"00:52:00,783","00:52:04,078","No, your father is not Santa."
660,"00:52:04,203","00:52:10,376",Then how do you explain... this?
661,"00:52:10,501","00:52:12,920","Right, that beard."
662,"00:52:13,004","00:52:18,176","That... I used that when I sang
in the town choir,"
663,"00:52:18,259","00:52:21,262","because I played the role
of a... magician."
664,"00:52:23,431","00:52:28,061","But you were so young then,
you don't remember that."
665,"00:52:30,271","00:52:33,733",So don't worry. I'm not Santa.
666,"00:52:33,816","00:52:40,073","Promise? 'Cause this will be an awful
Christmas for someone if you are!"
667,"00:52:43,242","00:52:44,452",Promise.
668,"00:52:44,535","00:52:48,706",Okay. But I'm keeping an eye on you.
669,"00:52:49,707","00:52:51,793",I'm keeping an eye on you.
670,"00:53:03,888","00:53:08,351",Be careful! You're tearing up the seams!
671,"00:53:08,434","00:53:10,436","Do you want this thing off, or not?"
672,"00:53:10,520","00:53:12,397","Sure, but it hurts."
673,"00:53:12,480","00:53:15,441","Ow, ow, ow! Be careful!"
674,"00:53:15,525","00:53:17,568","- Fine, I'll count to three.
- Okay, good."
675,"00:53:17,652","00:53:19,821","One, two...!"
676,"00:53:22,115","00:53:23,408","Yeah, yeah!"
677,"00:53:24,659","00:53:27,078","Oh, cuddle, cuddle!"
678,"00:53:27,161","00:53:30,373","- Are you okay?
- Yes, I landed in a cuddle."
679,"00:53:31,749","00:53:32,917",But what do we do now?
680,"00:53:35,503","00:53:38,339","- Did it go okay?
- Yes, it went great."
681,"00:53:38,965","00:53:41,426",I'm very proud of you.
682,"00:53:42,135","00:53:45,263","But do you know
what we have to do now?"
683,"00:53:45,346","00:53:46,764",No.
684,"00:53:46,848","00:53:48,641",We have to go up and change.
685,"00:53:48,725","00:53:49,934",Come on!
686,"00:53:52,437","00:53:58,568","Tears of longing rolled down her cheek
As she whispered into the moonlit night"
687,"00:53:58,651","00:54:05,074","And I became so faint, oh, Roger, Roger
Are you betraying your Hilma?"
688,"00:54:05,158","00:54:09,996","Have you forgotten last year's promises?
Which you made to me"
689,"00:54:10,037","00:54:14,751",Was it all a lie? Were you faking it?
690,"00:54:14,834","00:54:19,797","Well tonight I'll tell you something
I'm not who you think"
691,"00:54:19,881","00:54:21,924",Can you help zip me up?
692,"00:54:35,438","00:54:37,064","Oh, no, no, no!"
693,"00:54:42,737","00:54:45,948","Yes, this was a little difficult... There!"
694,"00:54:46,032","00:54:48,284",You look lovely.
695,"00:54:48,951","00:54:52,830","I wonder if I should hang those lights
up on the chimney."
696,"00:54:52,914","00:54:56,125","A little boy here is wondering
if Santa actually exists."
697,"00:54:56,209","00:54:58,252","- Probably a good idea.
- Yep."
698,"00:55:05,551","00:55:07,804",What? What is it?
699,"00:55:07,887","00:55:10,431",Where do you think that teddy bear is?
700,"00:55:12,683","00:55:16,938","I don't know, but I'm too old
for teddy bears anyways."
701,"00:55:17,021","00:55:20,483","You never get too old
for teddy bears, do you?"
702,"00:55:20,566","00:55:23,945","You know what, you actually do."
703,"00:55:24,070","00:55:26,531","There, your tie is ready."
704,"00:55:26,614","00:55:27,824",Okay.
705,"00:55:32,954","00:55:35,748","I hope he's happy, wherever he is."
706,"00:56:00,857","00:56:02,400",Those are delicious.
707,"00:56:03,401","00:56:07,321","- What are you doing?
- Looking for Santa, of course."
708,"00:56:08,531","00:56:10,157","- Nils?
- Yes?"
709,"00:56:10,241","00:56:14,370","Can you see if you can find
a gift for Grandma under the tree?"
710,"00:56:14,787","00:56:16,914",I know I can!
711,"00:56:17,707","00:56:19,750",Like this one!
712,"00:56:19,834","00:56:25,673","""With this you can write a poem,
and really show 'em."""
713,"00:56:26,799","00:56:28,009",It's a pen.
714,"00:56:30,803","00:56:35,182","There are some more here too,
but this one is for me."
715,"00:56:35,725","00:56:38,686",This one is for the whole family...
716,"00:56:42,106","00:56:45,484","But Mariann, where is your big gift?"
717,"00:56:47,153","00:56:48,696","Yes, where is it?"
718,"00:56:50,656","00:56:54,493","- I put it under the tree yesterday.
- Yes, I saw you do it."
719,"00:56:56,370","00:56:59,206","- That's odd.
- I'm sure it's here somewhere."
720,"00:57:05,504","00:57:08,257","- I put it there yesterday.
- Yes, I saw you do it."
721,"00:57:08,341","00:57:12,011","Yes, it must be here somewhere.
Strange..."
722,"00:57:12,094","00:57:13,554",It was me.
723,"00:57:14,764","00:57:16,015",Strange.
724,"00:57:16,641","00:57:17,975",It was me.
725,"00:57:18,476","00:57:20,686","- What?
- It was me."
726,"00:57:21,687","00:57:25,650",It was you who... Who did what?
727,"00:57:26,150","00:57:30,446","I thought since I ruined Paula's gift,"
728,"00:57:30,529","00:57:33,157",that she could get mine.
729,"00:57:34,784","00:57:36,410",What are you saying?
730,"00:57:38,704","00:57:40,289",Did you give away your gift?
731,"00:57:41,499","00:57:47,463","Did you give away your gift?
The big gift from us to you?"
732,"00:57:49,590","00:57:50,883",Hey...
733,"00:57:51,509","00:57:52,927",was Paula happy?
734,"00:57:53,052","00:57:55,221","Yes, she was very happy."
735,"00:57:56,055","00:58:00,851","You know what?
Then you did the right thing, Mariann."
736,"00:58:00,935","00:58:05,189","It's Christmas. And do you know
what's even better than receiving?"
737,"00:58:05,272","00:58:09,610","Giving away gifts.
No one is mad at you."
738,"00:58:11,362","00:58:12,571",No.
739,"00:58:13,990","00:58:15,324",You're so lovely.
740,"00:58:15,408","00:58:16,409",My sweet girl.
741,"00:58:18,619","00:58:21,706","I'm sorry, Mariann. I apologize."
742,"00:58:21,789","00:58:22,790",Hey...
743,"00:58:25,418","00:58:27,962","You know what?
That was a very kind gesture."
744,"00:58:28,045","00:58:29,463",Thank you.
745,"00:58:30,006","00:58:33,426",Sweetheart. Your mother is right.
746,"00:58:37,054","00:58:41,100","Well, there's nothing over here either.
This is so strange."
747,"00:58:42,018","00:58:46,022",But are you sure there's no door here?
748,"00:58:46,105","00:58:48,065","- Houses usually have doors.
- Doors?"
749,"00:58:48,149","00:58:51,777","- Yes.
- 1 didn't know we're looking for a door."
750,"00:58:51,861","00:58:54,071",I told you to look for a way out of here.
751,"00:58:54,155","00:58:55,406","- Yeah.
- Yeah?"
752,"00:58:55,489","00:58:59,493","Well, I did.
But no one said anything about doors."
753,"00:58:59,577","00:59:00,828",What was that?
754,"00:59:01,620","00:59:05,082","Well, well. Do we have a visitor?"
755,"00:59:05,207","00:59:07,084","Be careful, Bolla!"
756,"00:59:11,964","00:59:15,134","He looks like quite a character.
And he looks soft."
757,"00:59:15,217","00:59:16,761",Do you think he likes to cuddle?
758,"00:59:16,844","00:59:20,264","- What if...
- Bolla, you have to be quiet!"
759,"00:59:24,727","00:59:27,813",Do you think he'll cut us to pieces?
760,"00:59:28,481","00:59:30,608",I don't intend to find out.
761,"00:59:30,691","00:59:32,693","Come on, we have to hide."
762,"00:59:34,028","00:59:36,947","Are you okay?
I'll help you up, come on!"
763,"00:59:38,324","00:59:39,825",He's coming up here!
764,"00:59:44,747","00:59:46,415",Where did I put them?
765,"00:59:53,047","00:59:54,423",Strange.
766,"00:59:57,384","00:59:58,719",I can't remember...
767,"00:59:58,803","00:59:59,804",Come on.
768,"01:00:00,763","01:00:03,766","In the backpack,
yes, they have to be there."
769,"01:00:05,309","01:00:09,271","Silly me, not remembering
where I put them."
770,"01:00:10,856","01:00:11,941",No.
771,"01:00:12,483","01:00:14,193",This is nonsense.
772,"01:00:16,445","01:00:18,906","- Maybe we could...
- Hey, be quiet!"
773,"01:00:18,989","01:00:21,283","- Or we could...
- Be quiet, I have to think."
774,"01:00:21,367","01:00:22,368","Yeah, but..."
775,"01:00:22,451","01:00:25,538","Not now, Bolla!
I'm trying to think outside the box..."
776,"01:00:25,621","01:00:28,124","Hold on, the box!"
777,"01:00:29,834","01:00:31,377","Oh, silly me?!"
778,"01:00:33,003","01:00:34,547","This was a good idea, Teddy."
779,"01:00:34,630","01:00:37,424","Yeah, my head isn't just full of stuffing."
780,"01:00:37,550","01:00:39,552","Well, actually, it is."
781,"01:00:41,720","01:00:43,305",Is the coast clear?
782,"01:00:43,764","01:00:45,057",I think so.
783,"01:00:45,141","01:00:46,600","Then, let's go!"
784,"01:00:46,684","01:00:47,977",Let's go down here.
785,"01:00:48,102","01:00:49,603","- Go!
- It's all clear."
786,"01:00:49,687","01:00:51,147","- Yes.
- Are you ready?"
787,"01:00:51,230","01:00:54,233","- There.
- Ow!"
788,"01:00:54,316","01:00:55,776","- Easy now!
- I almost fell."
789,"01:00:55,860","01:00:58,320","- Take it easy now!
- You're pulling!"
790,"01:00:58,404","01:00:59,613",Be careful!
791,"01:01:04,535","01:01:07,454","- Bolla!
- Teddy!"
792,"01:01:09,582","01:01:10,749",What was that?
793,"01:01:12,543","01:01:14,336","Oh no, he's coming!"
794,"01:01:16,005","01:01:17,423",Are there mice here?
795,"01:01:25,431","01:01:26,640",Not now!
796,"01:01:36,984","01:01:39,486","That was close.
We have to get out of here."
797,"01:01:39,612","01:01:42,948","- He has his back turned, Bolla.
- Where did I hide them?"
798,"01:01:43,032","01:01:46,118","Quick, before he turns around.
Let's flip the box on three."
799,"01:01:46,202","01:01:48,162","One, two...!"
800,"01:01:56,545","01:01:57,546",Teddy!
801,"01:01:58,964","01:02:02,259",Freedom! Here we come!
802,"01:02:07,181","01:02:11,644","We did it, Bolla! We did...
Where are you?"
803,"01:02:11,727","01:02:12,728",Bolla?
804,"01:02:16,899","01:02:17,983","Oh, no!"
805,"01:02:19,151","01:02:21,153","- Bolla!
- I'm stuck!"
806,"01:02:21,278","01:02:24,073","Save yourself, Teddy"
807,"01:02:25,115","01:02:29,161","Not here either?
I'm going nuts!"
808,"01:02:29,245","01:02:31,205",I'm not leaving here without you!
809,"01:02:36,293","01:02:37,586","Careful, Teddy."
810,"01:02:41,215","01:02:44,593",Come on. You're completely stuck.
811,"01:02:44,677","01:02:47,846","Come on, Teddy,
use your bear strength!"
812,"01:02:58,023","01:02:59,358","Oh, no!"
813,"01:03:06,949","01:03:10,494","Aha, here you are!"
814,"01:03:23,757","01:03:25,342",Who might that be?
815,"01:03:33,100","01:03:35,811",It's Santa!
816,"01:03:35,936","01:03:38,314","Don't just leave him out there.
Let him in!"
817,"01:03:38,397","01:03:41,567","- Okay.
- Are there any nice children here?"
818,"01:03:46,989","01:03:50,701",I can sure feel the Christmas spirit here.
819,"01:03:51,243","01:03:53,287","- Have a seat!
- Sit down here."
820,"01:03:53,829","01:03:56,040",It would be nice to rest my legs.
821,"01:03:58,751","01:04:00,377",Come over here.
822,"01:04:05,382","01:04:07,259",Have you been nice this year?
823,"01:04:07,343","01:04:10,971","Yes, I've been very nice.
No problems. Nothing."
824,"01:04:11,055","01:04:14,808",That's good. Let's see...
825,"01:04:14,892","01:04:20,314","what we can find.
Here you are!"
826,"01:04:20,856","01:04:23,067","- Say thank you.
- Thank you."
827,"01:04:23,942","01:04:27,529","But, Santa, do you have anything
for my sister too?"
828,"01:04:28,614","01:04:34,661","I may just have something
for Mariann as well, yes."
829,"01:04:35,204","01:04:38,540",How do you know her name is Mariann?
830,"01:04:38,624","01:04:42,002","Do you remember my name too?
Are the reindeer parked..."
831,"01:04:42,086","01:04:46,632","Nils, let Santa deliver his gifts now."
832,"01:04:46,715","01:04:48,008",Okay.
833,"01:04:50,969","01:04:55,432","Was there anything special
you wished for this year?"
834,"01:04:57,101","01:04:59,895","There was, but I think it's too late."
835,"01:04:59,978","01:05:05,651","We'll see about that.
I am Santa, after all."
836,"01:05:05,734","01:05:07,319","Yes, you sure are."
837,"01:05:09,571","01:05:11,782",Here you are!
838,"01:05:12,324","01:05:14,118",Thank you!
839,"01:05:16,120","01:05:18,038","Well, open them!"
840,"01:05:19,123","01:05:20,707",Let's see who can do it first.
841,"01:05:24,878","01:05:27,381",I'm doing it right!
842,"01:05:47,025","01:05:48,694",Teddy!
843,"01:05:49,194","01:05:52,239",It's Teddy from the Christmas market!
844,"01:05:53,365","01:05:54,908",How in the world...?
845,"01:05:54,992","01:05:59,079","Well, you got something
you had wished for, after all."
846,"01:06:02,583","01:06:04,168",It's Bolla!
847,"01:06:04,293","01:06:06,003",Is it Bolla the Hedgehog?
848,"01:06:06,086","01:06:08,797",Of course it's Bolla the Hedgehog!
849,"01:06:09,673","01:06:11,675","Mom and Dad, look!"
850,"01:06:11,758","01:06:14,887",Hi there. Welcome to our home.
851,"01:06:15,304","01:06:18,223",You have to say that to Bolla too.
852,"01:06:18,307","01:06:22,227","Hi, Bolla. We're your new family.
Introduce yourself."
853,"01:06:22,311","01:06:24,271",Right. I'm Dad...
854,"01:06:24,354","01:06:26,356",And I'm Mom.
855,"01:06:26,440","01:06:29,234",I should probably continue on my rounds.
856,"01:06:29,359","01:06:32,237","- Thank you!
- You're welcome!"
857,"01:06:35,032","01:06:37,326",Have a lovely Christmas.
858,"01:06:37,451","01:06:39,786","Merry Christmas, Santa!"
859,"01:06:44,374","01:06:47,127",Welcome!
860,"01:06:49,171","01:06:51,215","Hi, Nils! Hi, Bolla!"
861,"01:06:51,298","01:06:54,134",Grandpa! Santa has been here.
862,"01:06:54,259","01:06:57,221",What?! Did I miss Santa?
863,"01:06:57,304","01:06:59,681","Yup, and it wasn't Dad!"
864,"01:06:59,806","01:07:01,808",I see he brought some gifts.
865,"01:07:01,892","01:07:04,436","Yup, this is Bolla the Hedgehog."
866,"01:07:04,561","01:07:06,355","- A hedgehog?
- Yes."
867,"01:07:06,438","01:07:09,066","Isn't it tricky cuddling
with all those quills?"
868,"01:07:09,149","01:07:14,655","Sure, but not Bolla. She has soft quills
that are perfect to cuddle with."
869,"01:07:17,407","01:07:19,076","And who is that, Mariann?"
870,"01:07:19,159","01:07:20,536",This is Teddy.
871,"01:07:20,619","01:07:23,622",Teddy? What a nice name
872,"01:07:25,916","01:07:28,126",Let me find my glasses.
873,"01:07:32,172","01:07:35,092","Okay, I think I'll take one of these
if we're starting."
874,"01:07:35,676","01:07:37,302","I love donuts, would you like one?"
875,"01:07:37,386","01:07:39,805","Sure, I can take a ginger snap."
876,"01:07:40,472","01:07:41,723",They look delicious.
877,"01:07:43,183","01:07:45,519","- Grandpa, was it you who...
- Shh!"
878,"01:07:47,646","01:07:49,940","- Merry Christmas!
- Merry Christmas!"
879,"01:07:50,399","01:07:54,611","Hey, get in here.
We have traditions to maintain."
880,"01:08:25,726","01:08:27,144",Cheers!
881,"01:08:33,650","01:08:36,236","No, that isn't what happened!"
882,"01:09:06,475","01:09:07,517",Cuddle.
883,"01:09:07,934","01:09:11,647","- Merry Christmas!
- Merry Christmas! Read for me."
884,"01:09:14,399","01:09:16,026","""Blackbird in the Chandelier""."
885,"01:09:19,696","01:09:21,406",You're so cute.
886,"01:09:35,962","01:09:37,214",There you go!
887,"01:09:45,597","01:09:49,393","Good night, Teddy, Merry Christmas!"
888,"01:10:08,954","01:10:10,330","Good night, Mariann."
889,"01:10:21,383","01:10:24,970","Teddy, did you just say something?"
890,"01:10:25,929","01:10:28,598","I... I said ""good night""."
891,"01:10:31,435","01:10:35,105",Would you like to... cuddle?
892,"01:10:35,856","01:10:38,024","Teddy, you're alive!"
893,"01:10:42,279","01:10:44,281",I knew it!
894,"01:10:58,879","01:11:01,423","Merry Christmas, Mariann!"
