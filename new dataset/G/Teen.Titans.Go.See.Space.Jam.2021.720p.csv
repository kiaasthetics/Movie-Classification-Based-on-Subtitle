2,"00:00:47,059","00:00:49,393","It looks like some kind
of alien spaceship."
3,"00:00:49,528","00:00:51,269","Oh, how wonderful."
4,"00:00:51,404","00:00:53,870","Perhaps these aliens
are the peaceful kind"
5,"00:00:54,006","00:00:55,340",that enjoy playing that
6,"00:00:57,608","00:00:59,576","If Hollywood movies
have taught me anything,"
7,"00:00:59,712","00:01:03,241","it's that space aliens only
come here for one reason,"
8,"00:01:03,377","00:01:04,477",to replace us!
9,"00:01:04,612","00:01:07,949","Well, no alien is replacing me."
10,"00:01:18,558","00:01:19,996","Greetings, Earthlings."
11,"00:01:20,131","00:01:21,726",We are the Nerdlucks.
12,"00:01:21,861","00:01:24,630","Oh, my goodness.
I know these guys."
13,"00:01:24,766","00:01:27,806","They're the aliens
from Space Jam."
14,"00:01:27,941","00:01:29,406",What's a Space Jam?
15,"00:01:29,542","00:01:31,601","It's only the greatest
sports movie of all time."
16,"00:01:31,737","00:01:32,737",Sorry. Never heard of it.
17,"00:01:32,871","00:01:34,309","- Me neither.
- Nor the I."
18,"00:01:34,444","00:01:36,248",How have you never heard of it?
19,"00:01:36,383","00:01:39,211","It stars Bugs Bunny
and Michael Jordan."
20,"00:01:39,346","00:01:40,487",Michael Jordan?
21,"00:01:40,622","00:01:41,912","Oh, yeah."
22,"00:01:42,048","00:01:44,153","That's the dude who
sells all them shoes."
23,"00:01:44,289","00:01:48,259","Oh, I wish to watch the movie about
the salesman who plays the basketball."
24,"00:01:48,394","00:01:51,456","Well, we happen to
own a copy on VHS."
25,"00:01:51,591","00:01:53,496",But our VCR is busted.
26,"00:01:53,631","00:01:55,966","No problem. We've got
a VCR in the tower."
27,"00:01:56,101","00:01:57,400",We can watch it there.
28,"00:01:57,536","00:01:58,708","- Yeah, let's check this out.
- Oh, yeah!"
29,"00:01:58,732","00:01:59,596","- Excellent!
- Let's do this."
30,"00:01:59,732","00:02:01,504","Wait, are you guys crazy?"
31,"00:02:04,406","00:02:08,014","Inviting these aliens into our
home is a horrible idea, Titans."
32,"00:02:08,149","00:02:10,479","How do we know we
can even trust them?"
33,"00:02:10,614","00:02:12,548","Just sit down and
watch the movie, dude."
34,"00:02:19,018","00:02:21,350","Oh, yeah. Space Jam!"
35,"00:02:21,486","00:02:22,486",No.
36,"00:02:24,323","00:02:29,532","This is Teen
Titans Go! See Space Jam."
37,"00:02:29,668","00:02:31,633","Now let's fast forward
to get to the good stuff."
38,"00:02:34,338","00:02:37,605","I just feel at this particular
time that I reached the pinnacle"
39,"00:02:37,741","00:02:40,537","of my basketball career
and I must retire."
40,"00:02:40,673","00:02:42,780",Holdup. MJ is retiring?
41,"00:02:42,915","00:02:45,511","Nice going, Cyborg. You skip
to the end of the movie."
42,"00:02:45,646","00:02:47,320","Nah, this is the beginning."
43,"00:02:47,455","00:02:50,449","But he said he was the done
playing the basketball."
44,"00:02:50,585","00:02:52,150","Yeah, he says that a lot."
45,"00:02:52,285","00:02:55,219","Anybody this, except
for one person, and, uh,"
46,"00:02:55,354","00:02:58,493","but I think I'm gonna go and
play professional baseball."
47,"00:02:58,629","00:03:00,157","What
position will you play?"
48,"00:03:00,292","00:03:02,367","I don't know.
As a kid, I was a pitcher."
49,"00:03:02,502","00:03:04,272","I think that'd be kind
of hard for me to pitch,"
50,"00:03:04,296","00:03:05,976","so I think I'm gonna
play the outfield now."
51,"00:03:22,657","00:03:23,915",No way!
52,"00:03:24,050","00:03:26,158","There's an amusement
park in space?"
53,"00:03:26,294","00:03:28,925","And look, it's
named after Robin."
54,"00:03:29,060","00:03:30,894",Ha. Very funny.
55,"00:03:31,029","00:03:34,729","But mark my words, Titans,
you're all making a huge mistake."
56,"00:03:55,154","00:03:56,718",Woo-hoo!
57,"00:03:58,756","00:04:01,017","Let's get out of here,
Dad, this stinks."
58,"00:04:01,153","00:04:03,428","Don't bring me here
anymore, all right?"
59,"00:04:03,563","00:04:05,127","Don't bring me here
anymore, all right?"
60,"00:04:05,262","00:04:06,590",Are you listening?
61,"00:04:06,725","00:04:07,833",Did you hear him?
62,"00:04:07,968","00:04:09,330",Did you hear him?
63,"00:04:09,466","00:04:11,335",That little brat is right.
64,"00:04:11,471","00:04:14,202","I've told you, if
I've told you once..."
65,"00:04:14,338","00:04:16,107","Yo, that's Danny DeVito."
66,"00:04:16,242","00:04:17,973",My dude played The Penguin.
67,"00:04:18,108","00:04:21,406","Man,
where's Batman."
68,"00:04:21,541","00:04:25,818","I told you a thousand, thousand,
thousand, thousand times!"
69,"00:04:25,954","00:04:28,448",We need new attractions.
70,"00:04:28,583","00:04:29,654","- Right!
- New ones."
71,"00:04:29,790","00:04:30,622",Uh-huh.
72,"00:04:30,758","00:04:31,758",Get it?
73,"00:04:31,785","00:04:32,956","Big, shiny new things. Yeah."
74,"00:04:33,091","00:04:34,292","Absolutely, sir."
75,"00:04:34,428","00:04:36,252","Look at me. Look
at me and listen."
76,"00:04:36,387","00:04:38,962",- The customer is always right.
77,"00:04:39,098","00:04:40,098",Right.
78,"00:04:40,133","00:04:41,591",What is he the doing?
79,"00:04:41,727","00:04:43,501",He's smoking.
80,"00:04:43,636","00:04:46,629","But smoking is so bad
for you, yo."
81,"00:04:46,764","00:04:47,932",Right.
82,"00:04:48,068","00:04:49,806","- Okay, we need something...
- Oop!"
83,"00:04:49,942","00:04:51,168",My bad.
84,"00:04:51,303","00:04:52,972",- We need something...
85,"00:04:53,781","00:04:54,781",Nutty.
86,"00:04:54,815","00:04:56,806",Nutty?
87,"00:04:56,942","00:04:59,622","I hopes ya'll don't mind, but I
loves counting butt shots in movies."
88,"00:04:59,711","00:05:01,780",That's one.
89,"00:05:01,916","00:05:03,953","- Something wacky.
-  Wacky."
90,"00:05:04,089","00:05:06,061","We need something, something,
something, something..."
91,"00:05:06,085","00:05:08,190","-We need something-
-Looney? Oops."
92,"00:05:08,325","00:05:09,760",Looney. Thank you.
93,"00:05:09,896","00:05:11,122",Looney?
94,"00:05:13,629","00:05:15,093",I'm an elk! Shoot me!
95,"00:05:20,502","00:05:22,602",Yes! Looney! Yes!
96,"00:05:22,737","00:05:25,272",Now you're talking. Looney.
97,"00:05:25,407","00:05:29,106","Looney. That's it, that's the
word I was looking for, Looney."
98,"00:05:29,241","00:05:31,641","- Get the Looney Tunes.
- Looney Tunes!"
99,"00:05:31,776","00:05:32,544",Bring 'em here.
100,"00:05:32,680","00:05:35,646","Sir, just noticing, sir."
101,"00:05:35,782","00:05:37,384",They're from Earth.
102,"00:05:37,520","00:05:38,918",What if they can't come?
103,"00:05:39,054","00:05:41,990","What did you say? What
if they can't come?"
104,"00:05:42,126","00:05:43,721",Uh-huh?
105,"00:05:43,857","00:05:45,831","- Make 'em.
- Cool."
106,"00:05:45,967","00:05:47,661",Make 'em.
107,"00:05:47,796","00:05:49,226",We're gonna get 'em.
108,"00:05:49,361","00:05:50,997","We're gonna get
'em. Yeah, right."
109,"00:06:00,542","00:06:02,242",Cyborg's fun fact.
110,"00:06:02,377","00:06:05,242","The number 45 was Michael's
high school jersey number."
111,"00:06:05,985","00:06:07,415",Strike!
112,"00:06:09,882","00:06:11,387",Looks good in a uniform.
113,"00:06:11,523","00:06:13,551",Looks great. Can't teach that.
114,"00:06:13,686","00:06:14,955",Can't teach it.
115,"00:06:15,654","00:06:17,094",Podolak!
116,"00:06:17,230","00:06:18,563","Podolak, come here."
117,"00:06:18,698","00:06:20,499","- I'm sorry I didn't mean...
- Come here."
118,"00:06:21,562","00:06:23,129","Yes, sir?"
119,"00:06:23,264","00:06:25,013","I want you to make sure
that nobody bothers Michael."
120,"00:06:25,037","00:06:26,841","I want him to be the
happiest player in the world."
121,"00:06:26,865","00:06:28,034",The happiest.
122,"00:06:29,209","00:06:31,235",Slider. Don't swing.
123,"00:06:36,545","00:06:37,879",Strike three!
124,"00:06:38,015","00:06:40,517","- I told you not to swing.
- Couldn't help it."
125,"00:06:40,653","00:06:42,649","I understand. Hey,
nice talking to ya."
126,"00:06:50,425","00:06:53,098","Wow. Everyone's so supportive
of Michael striking out."
127,"00:06:53,234","00:06:57,601","I believe they are hoping to get the
free sneakers from the nice salesman."
128,"00:06:57,736","00:06:59,472","We're not worried.
We're not worried."
129,"00:07:02,404","00:07:04,769","- Good job, Michael.
- Get out there, Michael. Don't worry."
130,"00:07:04,904","00:07:05,904",Good try. Good hustle.
131,"00:07:05,939","00:07:08,146","Good cut, Michael. Good cut."
132,"00:07:08,282","00:07:10,650","That was a strike out, Mike. That was
a good-looking strike out. Real good."
133,"00:07:10,674","00:07:12,321","I mean, you look good
when you strike out, man."
134,"00:07:12,345","00:07:14,065","When I strike out, man,
it looks nasty, man."
135,"00:07:14,112","00:07:15,455","At least you look good, man."
136,"00:07:17,486","00:07:19,085","Hi, Mr. Jordan."
137,"00:07:20,018","00:07:21,751","Mr. Jordan, I'm Stan..."
138,"00:07:26,264","00:07:27,467","Ow, jeez."
139,"00:07:31,737","00:07:34,165","You all right? That
was a nasty fall."
140,"00:07:34,301","00:07:37,935","Yeah. Oh, I'm Stan
Podolak, Mr. Jordan"
141,"00:07:38,071","00:07:40,040",I'm the Barons' new publicist.
142,"00:07:41,307","00:07:43,278","I'm here to make
your life easier."
143,"00:07:43,414","00:07:45,292","You want me to drive you somewhere,
I will drive you anywhere."
144,"00:07:45,316","00:07:47,196","You want me to pick up your
laundry, babysit your kids,"
145,"00:07:47,220","00:07:48,385",I will do it.
146,"00:07:48,521","00:07:50,281",I knew I recognized that dude.
147,"00:07:50,416","00:07:53,018","That's that fool from
Jurassic Park, yo."
148,"00:07:53,153","00:07:55,691","I am here to
personally guarantee"
149,"00:07:55,827","00:07:58,531","that no one will
ever bother you."
150,"00:08:04,638","00:08:07,533","Friends, look. It
is the Santy Claus."
151,"00:08:07,668","00:08:09,333","Ho, ho, ho."
152,"00:08:12,509","00:08:13,546",What was that?
153,"00:08:19,118","00:08:20,151",Hang on.
154,"00:08:20,286","00:08:23,183",Hanging on.
155,"00:08:23,318","00:08:25,287","Why is Looney Tunes in
the center of the Earth?"
156,"00:08:25,423","00:08:28,217","Because it's the looniest place
the writers could think of."
157,"00:08:28,353","00:08:30,387",- Oh. Whatever.
158,"00:08:33,828","00:08:35,858","- Bombastic.
- Cool."
159,"00:08:46,475","00:08:48,874","All right, you
irascible bunny. Come back."
160,"00:08:49,009","00:08:50,879","Ho, ho. There's my man Bugs."
161,"00:08:51,014","00:08:52,717","I'll be with you
in a second, folks,"
162,"00:08:52,852","00:08:55,653","after I finish with
nature boy here. Oop."
163,"00:08:55,789","00:08:59,350","All right, pesky wabbit.
I've got you now."
164,"00:09:00,590","00:09:02,688",Here's a fun fact.
165,"00:09:02,823","00:09:05,336","Bugs Bunny got his name when
legendary animator ""Ben-Bugs"" Hardaway"
166,"00:09:05,360","00:09:07,224","drew a sketch of a
rabbit which got labeled"
167,"00:09:07,360","00:09:09,668","by his fellow coworkers
as Bugs' Bunny."
168,"00:09:09,803","00:09:11,571","And Elmer Fudd was
originally named Egghead."
169,"00:09:13,040","00:09:14,040",Ouch.
170,"00:09:15,339","00:09:16,339",Hmm.
171,"00:09:18,807","00:09:21,739",One small step for moi!
172,"00:09:21,875","00:09:24,877","-  Moi!
- One giant leap for Moron Mountain!"
173,"00:09:27,512","00:09:30,150","And one whopper
headache for Elmer Fudd."
174,"00:09:34,526","00:09:36,391",Diminutive. Ain't they?
175,"00:09:36,526","00:09:39,428","- We seek the one they call Bugs Bunny.
- Yeah, Bugs Bunny."
176,"00:09:39,563","00:09:40,396",Have you seen him?
177,"00:09:40,531","00:09:41,531",Where is this guy?
178,"00:09:41,566","00:09:43,432",Is he around?
179,"00:09:43,567","00:09:45,596",Hmm... Bugs Bunny.
180,"00:09:45,732","00:09:50,141","Bugs Bunny. Say, does he
have great, big long ears?"
181,"00:09:50,276","00:09:51,441",Like this?
182,"00:09:51,576","00:09:53,105",Yeah.
183,"00:09:53,241","00:09:56,110","And does he hop
around like this?"
184,"00:09:59,353","00:10:00,853",Yeah.
185,"00:10:00,989","00:10:03,480","Well, does he say, ""What's
up, Doc?"" like this?"
186,"00:10:05,451","00:10:07,655","Eh... What's up, Doc?"
187,"00:10:07,790","00:10:08,854",Yeah.
188,"00:10:08,990","00:10:11,020","Nope, never heard of him."
189,"00:10:11,156","00:10:13,666",Aw!
190,"00:10:13,801","00:10:16,359","You know, maybe there
is no intelligent life"
191,"00:10:16,495","00:10:18,462","out there in the
universe after all."
192,"00:10:22,743","00:10:25,978","Hold on there,
Mr. Looney Tune."

these Nerdlucks are evil!"
194,"00:10:30,045","00:10:31,677","Ah, Bugs kinda had that coming."
195,"00:10:31,812","00:10:33,109","Okay, bunny."

So, like, where we goin'?"
199,"00:10:46,300","00:10:48,233",Are we there yet?
200,"00:10:48,368","00:10:50,178","Ah, I'm really sorry it
took so long, but, you know..."
201,"00:10:50,202","00:10:52,202","Sherm, Sherm,
don't, don't worry about it."
202,"00:10:52,240","00:10:53,541","...that exit on 65 wasn't
clearly marked. It was like..."
203,"00:10:53,565","00:10:55,005","Hold. Hold

207,"00:10:58,042","00:11:00,504","He must make the
modest of the salaries."
208,"00:11:00,640","00:11:02,285","Thanks for the ride,
Sherm. I appreciate it."
209,"00:11:02,309","00:11:04,512","- It's Stan, Mike.
- I'm sorry."
210,"00:11:04,647","00:11:06,587","But that's all right. You can
call me Sherm if you want to."
211,"00:11:06,611","00:11:08,716","Because I followed
your whole career"
212,"00:11:08,852","00:11:09,651","- and I just think you're the greatest athlete that's...
- Stan! Stan, Stan, Stan."
213,"00:11:09,786","00:11:11,086",That's ever lived.
214,"00:11:11,221","00:11:13,187","Gimme that remote! I

215,"00:11:21,963","00:11:23,030",Stop the music!

219,"00:11:29,038","00:11:31,703","So, what's the big emergency?"
220,"00:11:31,838","00:11:34,411","Uh, these little guys would
like to make an announcement."
221,"00:11:34,547","00:11:36,045","Here you go, shorty."
222,"00:11:36,181","00:11:38,176",- All right. All right.
223,"00:11:38,312","00:11:41,881","You, all of you,"

225,"00:11:44,716","00:11:47,320","See! I told you they
want to abduct us!"
226,"00:11:50,029","00:11:54,757","Ooh! We're
in big trouble now."
227,"00:11:54,892","00:11:58,060","We are taking you to our
theme park in outer space."
228,"00:11:58,195","00:11:59,196",No fooling.

232,"00:12:04,538","00:12:08,372","Oh, fear clutches
my breast."
233,"00:12:08,508","00:12:11,274","Okay. If these Nerdlucks
are so friendly,"
234,"00:12:11,409","00:12:13,212",then why is Bugs chained up?
235,"00:12:13,348","00:12:15,087","He's just doing a
little street magic."
236,"00:12:15,223","00:12:18,523","But they just called all of the
Looney Tunes their prisoners!"
237,"00:12:18,659","00:12:20,254","It's all part of the act, yo."
238,"00:12:20,389","00:12:23,618","I don't know. Something
smells fishy..."
239,"00:12:23,754","00:12:25,622","That would be your
breath, Robin."
240,"00:12:28,063","00:12:31,430",We ain't a-goin' nowheres!

a bit more kid friendly?"
243,"00:12:37,642","00:12:38,642",That's better.
244,"00:12:39,609","00:12:40,609",Oh.
245,"00:12:44,408","00:12:46,751","Eh, not so fast, doc."
246,"00:12:46,887","00:12:48,716","You just can't turn
us into slaves,"
247,"00:12:48,851","00:12:50,384",that would be bad.
248,"00:12:50,520","00:12:52,480","You've gotta give us a
chance to defend ourselves."
249,"00:12:52,559","00:12:54,924","Oh, yeah? Who says?"
250,"00:12:55,059","00:12:56,198","-  Says who?

254,"00:13:03,471","00:13:04,903",What's this?
255,"00:13:05,039","00:13:07,603","""Give them a chance
to defend themselves."""
256,"00:13:07,739","00:13:09,674",Do we have to?
257,"00:13:09,809","00:13:11,089","- It's in the rule book.
- It is."
258,"00:13:11,206","00:13:13,404",Okay. It is in the rule book.
259,"00:13:13,540","00:13:16,310",Uno momento! We have to confer.

to the 1970 movie, Patton,"
262,"00:13:22,952","00:13:24,018",which won Best Picture.
263,"00:13:24,154","00:13:26,118",But do you know which 2018 movie
264,"00:13:26,254","00:13:27,783",should have won best picture?
265,"00:13:30,926","00:13:32,629","All right, troops."
266,"00:13:32,764","00:13:34,523",It is for us to choose

challenge them to a spelling bee?"
271,"00:13:45,573","00:13:49,006","Say... We could have
a bowling tournament."
272,"00:13:50,977","00:13:54,309","Sufferin' Succotash!

the competition."
279,"00:14:07,832","00:14:09,032",Hmm. That's a good idea.

294,"00:14:45,003","00:14:46,400","- What's that?
- Beats me."
295,"00:14:46,536","00:14:47,263","- We didn't have that in school.

380,"00:18:56,484","00:18:59,823","- A-one, two, three, four. Disco disco duck!
- Guys! Nice outfit, Daffy."
381,"00:18:59,959","00:19:03,892","The little aliens say
it's their turn to use the court."
382,"00:19:04,027","00:19:05,462","Yeah, sure."
383,"00:19:05,597","00:19:07,860","Let the little pipsqueaks
knock themselves out."
384,"00:19:07,995","00:19:10,932","Too bad you can't practice
getting taller, boys."
385,"00:19:19,009","00:19:20,403",Whoooa!
386,"00:19:25,278","00:19:26,647",Ah!
387,"00:19:50,542","00:19:52,370","Holds up! So you
guys have the ability"
388,"00:19:52,506","00:19:53,804",to steal our talents
389,"00:19:53,940","00:19:55,504","and turn into monster
versions of us?"
390,"00:19:55,640","00:19:56,840",That's right.
391,"00:19:56,976","00:19:58,515","Then what are you
the waiting for?"
392,"00:19:58,651","00:20:00,943","Yeah, we want to see what
you guys look like as us."
393,"00:20:01,079","00:20:03,716","No, no, no. This
is a terrible..."
394,"00:20:03,851","00:20:05,614","Nah, don't listen
to him. Go for it!"
395,"00:20:05,750","00:20:07,424","Okay, if you say so."
396,"00:20:15,826","00:20:18,934","Whoa! Booyah, dude!"
397,"00:20:20,270","00:20:23,600",Azarath Metrion Zinthos!
398,"00:20:23,736","00:20:26,608",That's what's up!
399,"00:20:28,839","00:20:31,477",This is the amazing...
400,"00:20:31,612","00:20:34,915",Ha-ha! Huh? Hey! What gives?
401,"00:20:35,051","00:20:38,048","Why do they have cool new
talents and I don't have any?"
402,"00:20:38,183","00:20:40,719","That's 'cause
you got stuck with Robin"
403,"00:20:40,855","00:20:43,293","and he ain't gots
no talent."
404,"00:20:43,429","00:20:45,924","I do too have talent.
Check this out."
405,"00:20:46,059","00:20:49,558","And slide, eeeyyy,
ooh-ooh, hooma-chaaa!"
406,"00:20:51,532","00:20:52,731","Dude, you gotta stop."
407,"00:20:52,867","00:20:54,504","Let's just get
back to the movie."
408,"00:20:56,734","00:20:57,870","Hey, little pig..."
409,"00:20:59,112","00:21:00,543",- Boo.
410,"00:21:02,313","00:21:03,606",I wet myself.
411,"00:21:07,321","00:21:10,082","Time to play a
little basketball."
412,"00:21:14,627","00:21:17,457","Those little pipsqueaks
just turned into superstars!"
413,"00:21:17,593","00:21:20,364",They're monsters!
414,"00:21:20,500","00:21:24,530","Sufferin Succotash!
They're monstars!"
415,"00:21:24,666","00:21:26,938","See, Titans? They're monsters!"
416,"00:21:27,073","00:21:29,439","No, they're Monstars."
417,"00:21:29,575","00:21:31,234","That's like a whole
letter difference."
418,"00:21:31,369","00:21:34,313","Eh, I think we might need
a little bit of help."
419,"00:21:36,016","00:21:37,016","Okay, little fella."
420,"00:21:37,116","00:21:38,883","Hey, it's Bill Murray!"
421,"00:21:39,019","00:21:40,151",I love Bill Murray.
422,"00:21:40,287","00:21:42,913","- That dude's my hero, yo!
- Hero?"
423,"00:21:43,049","00:21:45,120","But he does not
have the superpower."
424,"00:21:45,255","00:21:46,622","Oh, yes, he does."
425,"00:21:46,757","00:21:49,284","Bill Murray's superpower
is being Bill Murray."
426,"00:21:50,659","00:21:53,855","You my friend, or you my enemy?"
427,"00:21:53,991","00:21:55,360","You are my friend, right?"
428,"00:21:55,495","00:21:56,826",You are my ally.
429,"00:21:56,961","00:21:58,793",Classic Jordan versus Bird!
430,"00:21:58,929","00:22:00,101",That dude's a bird?
431,"00:22:00,237","00:22:01,631",Now I see it!
432,"00:22:01,766","00:22:02,933",Draw the feathers
433,"00:22:03,069","00:22:04,837",and there's the very large beak!
434,"00:22:04,973","00:22:07,969","But I'm not sure how
he lays the eggs."
435,"00:22:08,104","00:22:09,407",Larry Bird doesn't lay eggs.
436,"00:22:09,542","00:22:10,542",He lay-ups!
437,"00:22:12,481","00:22:13,611","You are my associate,"
438,"00:22:13,746","00:22:14,952",my personal assistant.
439,"00:22:15,087","00:22:16,711",You are my weapon.
440,"00:22:16,846","00:22:17,846",You are leaving.
441,"00:22:18,925","00:22:20,216",Oh.
442,"00:22:20,351","00:22:21,991","- Great shot.
- Oh, nice shot, Mr. Murray."
443,"00:22:25,031","00:22:26,731",Cyborg's Fun Fact.
444,"00:22:26,866","00:22:29,732","Bill Murray's hat was invented
in 1880 by Robert W. Patton!"
445,"00:22:29,868","00:22:32,498","Who used to predict weather
for The Seattle Times."
446,"00:22:35,342","00:22:37,332","- Good try.
- Not bad. Not bad."
447,"00:22:37,467","00:22:38,883","Something for
you all to shoot at."
448,"00:22:38,907","00:22:40,874","- Hit it good, Larry.
- Do my best."
449,"00:22:42,841","00:22:43,877",It was a good shot.
450,"00:22:44,710","00:22:46,746","Yeah, I know."
451,"00:22:46,882","00:22:48,162","Mike, I gotta ask you something."
452,"00:22:48,287","00:22:50,015",The NBA has to face reality.
453,"00:22:50,150","00:22:52,116","What's happening to
these players is serious."
454,"00:22:52,252","00:22:55,051","They're gonna need new
players with talent,"
455,"00:22:55,186","00:22:58,562","guys who are skilled, but never really
thought about a professional career before."
456,"00:23:00,958","00:23:02,324",You think I got a shot?
457,"00:23:04,465","00:23:05,333","Come on, really?"
458,"00:23:05,469","00:23:06,901","- No.
- Don't kid me."
459,"00:23:07,036","00:23:10,702","Listen, it's a man's
game, and you can't play."
460,"00:23:10,837","00:23:12,368",What if I tried really hard?
461,"00:23:12,504","00:23:14,576","Can you keep it down? I'm
trying to hit this ball."
462,"00:23:14,711","00:23:16,411","It's because I'm
white, isn't it?"
463,"00:23:16,546","00:23:18,778",No. Larry's white. So what?
464,"00:23:18,914","00:23:21,453","Larry's not white,
Larry's clear."
465,"00:23:23,918","00:23:24,991","- Good shot, Larry.
- That far?"
466,"00:23:25,015","00:23:26,557",Get inside of this ball.
467,"00:23:27,890","00:23:30,557","Ooh, you
clowns can't beat that."
468,"00:23:30,693","00:23:32,227",It's the best shot I ever hit.
469,"00:23:32,363","00:23:35,397","Ugh, golf is so boring."
470,"00:23:35,532","00:23:37,463","Well, of course it's boring."
471,"00:23:37,598","00:23:40,171","The movie's got NBA players,
space aliens and the Looney Tunes."
472,"00:23:40,306","00:23:43,433","If they made the scene any more exciting,
the audience's head would explode."
473,"00:23:43,569","00:23:46,138","You feel that the NBA has
to face reality, don't you?"
474,"00:23:46,274","00:23:48,348","Just gotta start looking for
some more dominant players"
475,"00:23:48,372","00:23:49,732","in places they
never looked before."
476,"00:23:49,776","00:23:51,075",Just look at the ball.
477,"00:23:51,211","00:23:52,891","Visualize the shot
where you want it to go."
478,"00:23:52,944","00:23:54,116","Right, right, right."
479,"00:23:54,251","00:23:55,619",Be the ball.
480,"00:23:55,754","00:23:57,399","- Be the ball.
-  Get off the tee."
481,"00:23:57,423","00:23:58,663","- Why?
-  You can't jump."
482,"00:24:00,785","00:24:02,252",I... Yeah. Go on.
483,"00:24:03,019","00:24:04,153",Close to the pin.
484,"00:24:04,289","00:24:06,128","Close to the
pin, for dinner?"
485,"00:24:06,263","00:24:08,005","-  Sounds good.
-  I'll go close to the pin."
486,"00:24:08,029","00:24:09,709","-  Okay.
- I'll take some of that."
487,"00:24:12,568","00:24:14,172",That's not bad.
488,"00:24:14,307","00:24:15,533",It's a good shot.
489,"00:24:15,668","00:24:16,706",Get down!
490,"00:24:18,573","00:24:19,676",Look at that spin.
491,"00:24:27,950","00:24:30,016","Hey. Since when are
golf balls magnetic?"
492,"00:24:31,419","00:24:32,419",Come on.
493,"00:24:34,984","00:24:36,495",It is alive!
494,"00:24:41,825","00:24:45,062",-  My first hole in one. Yes!
495,"00:24:45,198","00:24:46,995","-  Oh!
-  Don't say it."
496,"00:24:47,131","00:24:48,199",You ever see this before?
497,"00:24:48,975","00:24:50,199",Larry?
498,"00:24:50,335","00:24:52,174","Nothing but the
bottom of the cup."
499,"00:24:52,309","00:24:55,372","-  Oh, God, that's his ball.
- Yeah, yeah, it's my ball."
500,"00:24:55,507","00:24:57,681","- Sorry.
- Wait, wait. Let me get a picture."
501,"00:24:57,816","00:24:59,744","All right, here we go.
You're gonna smile."
502,"00:24:59,879","00:25:01,989","You're reaching... You're reaching
for the ball and then you smile."
503,"00:25:02,013","00:25:03,188","- Okay?
- Yes."
504,"00:25:03,323","00:25:04,955",And you think this is good.
505,"00:25:05,090","00:25:07,170","-  Just take the picture!
- All right, okay."
506,"00:25:07,620","00:25:08,620",Uh-oh.
507,"00:25:16,129","00:25:17,826","What kind
of camera is that?"
508,"00:25:17,962","00:25:19,474","- Just a regular...
- Would you not point that at me please?"
509,"00:25:19,498","00:25:20,908","- And close the lens cap.
- I didn't do anything..."
510,"00:25:20,932","00:25:21,932",Where'd he go?
511,"00:25:24,135","00:25:28,875","Fun fact... The temperature at the
center of the Earth is 9,800 degrees."
512,"00:25:29,011","00:25:30,681","No, no, no, no!"
513,"00:25:43,393","00:25:46,895","Oh, look out for that first
step, doc. It's a real lulu."
514,"00:25:47,661","00:25:49,094",Bugs Bunny?
515,"00:25:49,230","00:25:51,359","Eh, you were expecting
maybe the Easter Bunny?"
516,"00:25:51,495","00:25:52,861","You're a cartoon.
You're not real."
517,"00:25:52,997","00:25:54,098","Not real, eh?"
518,"00:25:54,233","00:25:56,602","If I weren't real,
could I do this?"
519,"00:25:59,343","00:26:01,069",Ugh!
520,"00:26:01,205","00:26:02,773","Oh, look. Is that Michael?"
521,"00:26:02,909","00:26:04,579",It's Michael!
522,"00:26:04,715","00:26:06,341",Why is Sylvester in the sewer?
523,"00:26:06,477","00:26:08,015","He's getting ready
to ambush Tweety."
524,"00:26:10,323","00:26:11,555",Bah!
525,"00:26:11,691","00:26:13,585","Okay, but why is
Taz in the mailbox?"
526,"00:26:13,721","00:26:16,759","Because Tasmanian devils are the
number one cause of mail tampering."
527,"00:26:16,895","00:26:19,053","Come on, Raven. This
isn't rocket science."
528,"00:26:19,188","00:26:20,890",Basketball!
529,"00:26:21,026","00:26:23,258",Ooh! I thought I saw...
530,"00:26:23,394","00:26:25,769",I did. I did see Michael Jordan.
531,"00:26:26,769","00:26:28,372","Eh, pardon me, Mr. Jordan."
532,"00:26:28,508","00:26:30,967",Can I have your...
533,"00:26:31,103","00:26:32,268","Your John Hancock, please?"
534,"00:26:32,404","00:26:34,844","Back off! Let the
doctor take a look."
535,"00:26:36,577","00:26:37,741",Woops!
536,"00:26:37,877","00:26:38,942",A little high.
537,"00:26:39,078","00:26:40,617","- No.
- Going down."
538,"00:26:40,753","00:26:44,117","- Woo-hoo!
-  No!"
539,"00:26:45,216","00:26:48,187",- Oh!
540,"00:26:48,322","00:26:51,289","So... what do you say
we go for a little spin?"
541,"00:26:52,164","00:26:53,225",Yes.
542,"00:26:54,067","00:26:55,325",Hmm.
543,"00:26:55,461","00:26:57,332","Now, let's see what
we got inside here."
544,"00:26:59,866","00:27:01,299","Say ""ah""."
545,"00:27:03,341","00:27:04,372",All right.
546,"00:27:04,507","00:27:05,842",He's okay!
547,"00:27:07,413","00:27:08,746",What's going on here?
548,"00:27:08,881","00:27:11,408","Why, Michael, I thought
you'd never ask."
549,"00:27:11,544","00:27:13,411","You see, these aliens
come from outer space"
550,"00:27:13,546","00:27:15,615","and they want to make us
slaves in their theme park."
551,"00:27:15,751","00:27:17,616","Eh, what do we care?"
552,"00:27:17,751","00:27:19,968","They're little. So we challenge
them to a basketball game."
553,"00:27:19,992","00:27:21,760","But then they show up
and they ain't so little."
554,"00:27:21,784","00:27:24,287","They're huge! We need
to beat these guys,"
555,"00:27:24,422","00:27:25,902","because they're
talking about slavery."
556,"00:27:25,964","00:27:27,635","They're going to make
us do stand-up comedy,"
557,"00:27:27,659","00:27:30,366","the same jokes every
night for all eternity."
558,"00:27:30,502","00:27:32,068",What's he whining about?
559,"00:27:32,203","00:27:34,532","I know comedians who would
love that kind of job security."
560,"00:27:34,667","00:27:38,507","Entertainment is indeed the
toughest of the businesses."
561,"00:27:38,643","00:27:41,641","We're gonna be locked up like wild
animals and then trotted out to perform"
562,"00:27:41,776","00:27:46,551","for a bunch of low-brow, bug-eyed,
fat-headed, humor-challenged aliens!"
563,"00:27:46,687","00:27:49,319","Eh, what I'm trying to say is..."
564,"00:27:49,454","00:27:52,415",We need your help!
565,"00:27:52,550","00:27:54,054","Yeah, but I'm a
baseball player now."
566,"00:27:54,189","00:27:57,520","Right. And I'm a
Shakespearean actor."
567,"00:28:04,336","00:28:05,726",Stop the movie!
568,"00:28:05,862","00:28:08,399","If I laugh any harder,
I's gonna pee myself."
569,"00:28:09,868","00:28:11,170",Oops.
570,"00:28:11,306","00:28:13,503","That Bugs
Bunny is pretty loony."
571,"00:28:13,639","00:28:16,840","You want to see loony?
We'll show you loony."
572,"00:28:45,340","00:28:47,002","You guys want to watch
more of the movie?"
573,"00:28:47,137","00:28:48,137",Yeah!
574,"00:28:51,877","00:28:53,042",Mike?
575,"00:28:53,178","00:28:54,951","Michael, it's Stan."
576,"00:28:55,751","00:28:56,951",It's Stan Podolak.
577,"00:28:57,087","00:28:59,450","Look, I need you to
come out now, okay?"
578,"00:28:59,586","00:29:01,716","Because you've got a
baseball game tomorrow."
579,"00:29:01,852","00:29:04,026","I'd look pretty stupid
if you don't show up."
580,"00:29:05,896","00:29:07,126",You think Michael's all right?
581,"00:29:07,262","00:29:08,622","Boy, I hate to
leave him like this."
582,"00:29:08,699","00:29:10,298",I'm sure he's fine.
583,"00:29:10,434","00:29:12,801","I think he just had to get
away from that Stan character."
584,"00:29:12,936","00:29:15,269","Oh, God. He's
pathetic, isn't he?"
585,"00:29:15,405","00:29:17,606","Larry, I'm going to give
us both twos back there."
586,"00:29:17,742","00:29:20,705","- We weren't in any kind of emotional state to putt.
- I think that's fair."
587,"00:29:20,840","00:29:22,075",Yeah.
588,"00:29:22,211","00:29:24,777","Come on, Larry Bird!
To the Batcave!"
589,"00:29:31,854","00:29:35,590","Look, I want to help, but I haven't
played basketball in a long time."
590,"00:29:35,726","00:29:36,726",My timing's all off.
591,"00:29:36,827","00:29:38,362","Eh, we'll fix your timing."
592,"00:29:38,498","00:29:40,154",Look at our facilities.
593,"00:29:40,289","00:29:41,756",We've got hoops.
594,"00:29:42,799","00:29:44,330",We got weights.
595,"00:29:45,030","00:29:46,797",We've got balls.
596,"00:29:46,932","00:29:47,766",Whoa!
597,"00:29:47,901","00:29:48,901",You sure do.
598,"00:29:48,970","00:29:50,303",This place is a mess.
599,"00:29:50,438","00:29:52,705","Mess? You're worried
about a little mess?"
600,"00:29:52,840","00:29:56,471","There's nothing here a little
spit-shine wouldn't fix."
601,"00:29:56,606","00:29:58,674","- Spit-shine!
- Spit-shine!"
602,"00:30:00,485","00:30:02,686","Remember, kids,"
603,"00:30:02,821","00:30:05,941","when your parents tell you to clean your
room, just give it the old spit-shine."
604,"00:30:17,503","00:30:19,601",Lemony fresh.
605,"00:30:19,736","00:30:21,103",You guys are nuts.
606,"00:30:21,238","00:30:24,368","Correction.
We're Looney Tunes."
607,"00:30:24,504","00:30:26,402","And as such are the

610,"00:30:32,978","00:30:34,109",Mmuah!
611,"00:30:41,724","00:30:43,323",I'm here.
612,"00:30:44,396","00:30:45,754","Me, too."
613,"00:30:47,026","00:30:48,196",That hurt.
614,"00:30:50,801","00:30:52,301",Who are these guys?
615,"00:30:52,437","00:30:55,874","Well, uh, remember the tiny
aliens I told you about?"
616,"00:30:56,870","00:30:57,872",Oh.
617,"00:30:58,007","00:30:59,569",You heard of the Dream Team?
618,"00:30:59,704","00:31:02,511","Well, we're the Mean
Team, wussy man."
619,"00:31:02,646","00:31:03,847",Wussy man.
620,"00:31:03,983","00:31:05,875","- ""Wussy man""?
- We're the Monstars!"
621,"00:31:06,011","00:31:07,717",M-O-N...
622,"00:31:07,853","00:31:10,515","Let's see what you got, chump."
623,"00:31:11,749","00:31:13,453",I don't play basketball anymore.
624,"00:31:13,588","00:31:16,125","""I don't
play basketball anymore."""
625,"00:31:17,223","00:31:18,924",Maybe you're chicken.
626,"00:31:20,734","00:31:23,390","I say, I resemble that remark."
627,"00:31:23,526","00:31:24,665",You calling me chicken?
628,"00:31:24,800","00:31:26,636","Hey, come here."
629,"00:31:26,771","00:31:29,604",- Whoa!
630,"00:31:32,275","00:31:33,939",That's gonna give me nightmares.
631,"00:31:35,582","00:31:37,338",Ooh! Watch the footwork.
632,"00:31:37,474","00:31:39,240",Can you believe it?
633,"00:31:39,375","00:31:40,407",Whoa!
634,"00:31:40,543","00:31:42,815",Get out of the way!
635,"00:31:45,556","00:31:46,413",Ah!
636,"00:31:46,549","00:31:48,559","Hey, everybody!"
637,"00:31:48,694","00:31:51,462",Look at your hero now.
638,"00:31:55,001","00:31:56,731","You guys are making
a big mistake."
639,"00:31:56,867","00:31:58,459",You're all washed up...
640,"00:31:58,594","00:32:01,567","- Baldy.
- ""Baldy""?"
641,"00:32:01,702","00:32:04,432","He's not washed up.
Michael's the greatest ever."
642,"00:32:04,568","00:32:06,202","- Shut up.
- Doh!"
643,"00:32:09,682","00:32:11,877",My poor little cranium.
644,"00:32:12,012","00:32:13,012",You okay?
645,"00:32:13,114","00:32:14,749",Yeah. Are you okay?
646,"00:32:14,884","00:32:16,585","- Hey!
- Whoops."
647,"00:32:16,720","00:32:20,618","You're not scared
of them, are you, Michael?"
648,"00:32:30,099","00:32:31,179",Let's play some basketball.
649,"00:32:31,297","00:32:32,297",Yeah!
650,"00:32:36,906","00:32:38,335",What do you doing?
651,"00:32:38,471","00:32:40,638","I'm, uh... I'm fixing a divot."
652,"00:32:41,414","00:32:42,414",Oh.
653,"00:32:43,741","00:32:45,049",He's fixing a divot.
654,"00:32:51,822","00:32:55,149","Fun fact... Schlesinger Gym was
named after Leon Schlesinger,"
655,"00:32:55,285","00:32:57,460","who was the original
producer of The Looney Tunes,"
656,"00:32:57,595","00:33:00,856","and the gym is modeled after
a Warner Brothers sound stage."
657,"00:33:26,158","00:33:28,453","Has anyone here ever
played basketball?"
658,"00:33:28,589","00:33:31,258","- Um, I have..."
659,"00:33:31,394","00:33:33,229","I'd like to try
out for the team."
660,"00:33:34,060","00:33:35,060",Hey.
661,"00:33:35,131","00:33:37,060",Hi. My name is Lola Bunny.
662,"00:33:37,195","00:33:38,700",Lola?
663,"00:33:38,836","00:33:40,195",Yes?
664,"00:33:40,330","00:33:41,466",Hello.
665,"00:33:41,601","00:33:43,641","Eh, my name is...
Bugs."
666,"00:33:43,776","00:33:47,006","- You wanna
play a little one-on-one, doll?"
667,"00:33:47,141","00:33:48,877","- ""Doll""?
- Uh-huh."
668,"00:33:49,012","00:33:52,075",On the court... Bugs.
669,"00:33:52,210","00:33:53,642",Sure.
670,"00:33:53,777","00:33:56,010","- Oh, she's hot."
671,"00:33:58,152","00:34:00,091","- Ready?
- Yes."
672,"00:34:02,018","00:34:06,555","- I got it, I got it..."
673,"00:34:06,690","00:34:08,264",The girl's got some skills.
674,"00:34:10,195","00:34:11,531",Yes?
675,"00:34:14,467","00:34:17,435","Don't ever call me ""doll."""
676,"00:34:17,570","00:34:19,941","Indeed, she is not one of these"
677,"00:34:20,077","00:34:22,245","or these, or any of these."
678,"00:34:24,246","00:34:25,611",- Check.
679,"00:34:27,777","00:34:30,313","Hey, nice playing with ya."
680,"00:34:30,448","00:34:32,479",She's... leaving?
681,"00:34:32,615","00:34:34,665","Yeah! Because one single basket
automatically gets you on the team."
682,"00:34:34,689","00:34:36,290","Well, no wonder they
need Michael so bad."
683,"00:34:36,426","00:34:37,866","- Mais oui!
- Okay. Where's the ball?"
684,"00:34:40,423","00:34:43,563","- Let's do some drills.
-  Yeah, let's do that."
685,"00:34:47,438","00:34:49,463","Can anyone lend me
a pair of sneakers?"
686,"00:34:49,599","00:34:51,274","Uh, sneakers?"
687,"00:34:54,310","00:34:56,244","-  Oh.
- Sowwy."
688,"00:34:56,380","00:34:57,860","Someone's gonna have
to go to my house"
689,"00:34:57,984","00:34:59,480",and pick up my basketball gear.
690,"00:34:59,616","00:35:03,010","- To your house? In 3-D land?
-  Yeah."
691,"00:35:03,145","00:35:06,251","Would somebody get
this guy a mask? Ugh."
692,"00:35:06,386","00:35:08,620",And whatever you do
693,"00:35:08,756","00:35:10,760","don't forget my North
Carolina shorts."
694,"00:35:10,896","00:35:13,536","-  Your shorts? From college?
-  Ooh-hoo."
695,"00:35:13,632","00:35:16,501","I wore them under my Chicago
Bulls uniform every game."
696,"00:35:19,395","00:35:22,034","So why can't Michael get
his own basketball shorts?"
697,"00:35:22,169","00:35:23,169",Beats me.
698,"00:35:23,304","00:35:25,504",I too am the very lost.
699,"00:35:25,640","00:35:27,135","I've seen this movie
a hundred times"
700,"00:35:27,270","00:35:29,190","and I still don't know
why he can't go back home."
701,"00:35:29,309","00:35:32,208","Well, we were in the movie and
we don't even know the reason."
702,"00:35:32,344","00:35:35,285","Well, we can go online, get
more information on the film."
703,"00:35:42,991","00:35:46,028","Titans.
Can I have word with you?"
704,"00:35:46,164","00:35:49,995","Listen up. I think these aliens have
something sinister planned with this website."
705,"00:35:50,131","00:35:52,665","Why else would it still be
around after all these years?"
706,"00:35:52,800","00:35:54,904","Because it's super
awesome. That's why."
707,"00:35:55,039","00:35:56,869",But look! Jam Central.
708,"00:35:57,004","00:35:59,476","They're probably using this
site to jam our computer,"
709,"00:35:59,612","00:36:02,210","so we can't call for help
when they try to replace us!"
710,"00:36:02,345","00:36:04,546","Stop being the paranoid, Robin."
711,"00:36:04,681","00:36:06,948","Now let's figure out why
MJ can't go back home."
712,"00:36:07,084","00:36:08,815",Hmm. Here we go.
713,"00:36:08,950","00:36:10,991","It says here that Michael
had to join the Looney Tunes"
714,"00:36:11,015","00:36:12,613","because they
wouldn't let him go."
715,"00:36:12,748","00:36:15,218","Oh, now I get it!"
716,"00:36:15,353","00:36:17,794","In order to prevent themselves
from becoming prisoners,"
717,"00:36:17,929","00:36:20,329","the Looney Tunes had to
make Michael their prisoner."
718,"00:36:20,465","00:36:22,994","Oh, yeah! That makes
total sense, yo!"
719,"00:36:23,130","00:36:26,733","And look! It says here that
the Michael Jordan's lawyer"
720,"00:36:26,869","00:36:29,867","originally came up with
the idea for the Space Jam."
721,"00:36:30,003","00:36:33,407","Well, if anyone knows
comedy, it's lawyers."
722,"00:36:33,543","00:36:35,769","Okay, Titans. You
got your answer."
723,"00:36:35,905","00:36:39,879","Now can we please get off this
website before something bad happens?"
724,"00:36:40,015","00:36:42,847","Not yet, bro. I want to play
some of them classic games."
725,"00:36:47,553","00:36:48,985",I knew it!
726,"00:36:49,120","00:36:50,840","This website is trying
to hack our computer!"
727,"00:36:51,456","00:36:53,524","Relax, dude."
728,"00:36:53,659","00:36:55,704","The computer is probably just having
an issue with the outdated software."
729,"00:36:55,728","00:36:57,858","We can't
take that risk!"
730,"00:36:57,993","00:36:59,562",We need to shut it down now!
731,"00:37:03,006","00:37:04,865",Is he the dead?
732,"00:37:05,001","00:37:06,704","Mm, no. He's still breathing."
733,"00:37:06,840","00:37:08,741","Great! Let's get
back to the movie."
734,"00:37:11,010","00:37:12,877","The
view back here stinks."
735,"00:37:14,017","00:37:15,951",Whoa!
736,"00:37:16,086","00:37:17,792","-  Whoa! Oh, what?
- We're right in front of Michael's house."
737,"00:37:17,816","00:37:20,452",- I knew that!
738,"00:37:20,587","00:37:22,126","Okay, let's go in this way."
739,"00:37:22,262","00:37:24,757","I say let's
go in that way!"
740,"00:37:25,923","00:37:27,991",He just never learns.
741,"00:37:30,365","00:37:32,233","Now, let me see."
742,"00:37:32,368","00:37:35,801","I must be very, very, close."
743,"00:37:38,440","00:37:39,605",- Mother!
744,"00:37:45,884","00:37:47,884",Nice digs.
745,"00:37:50,247","00:37:53,456","Well, well. I wonder
who that could be."
746,"00:37:55,821","00:37:58,929","Twinkle, twinkle, little star."
747,"00:37:59,065","00:38:01,458",Shh! Everyone's sleepin'!
748,"00:38:01,594","00:38:03,427",I knew that.
749,"00:38:03,562","00:38:06,599","Come on! Come on! We gotta find
Michael's basketball stuff."
750,"00:38:06,735","00:38:08,629","Now, spread out and
search the place."
751,"00:38:08,765","00:38:10,435","Yes, sahib."
752,"00:38:10,570","00:38:11,901","Oh, brother!"
753,"00:38:12,036","00:38:14,273","Here I am, in the
peak of my form,"
754,"00:38:14,408","00:38:17,169","- playin' second banana to some sort of a hare-brain.
- Yap, yap, yap."
755,"00:38:17,281","00:38:19,749",Hmm. This could be useful.
756,"00:38:19,884","00:38:21,852",Ah-ha!
757,"00:38:21,988","00:38:24,784","Michael must really love underwear
to keep it in his trophy room."
758,"00:38:25,950","00:38:27,782",Oh! One of his shoes.
759,"00:38:27,918","00:38:29,855",Nope. Nope. Nope.
760,"00:38:32,857","00:38:34,563",Where is that other shoe?

764,"00:38:45,768","00:38:48,278","Nothing to see here, kid. We're
just breaking and entering."
765,"00:38:48,414","00:38:49,842","What a fuzz-foot.
You are so clumsy."
766,"00:38:50,975","00:38:53,274","- Catch, featherhead.
- Thanks."
767,"00:38:57,121","00:38:58,681","Well, time to go."
768,"00:38:58,816","00:39:00,523",Did we get everything?
769,"00:39:01,521","00:39:02,921",The shorts!
770,"00:39:03,995","00:39:05,187",In there?
771,"00:39:06,196","00:39:07,827","Okay, I'll check."
772,"00:39:12,368","00:39:14,328",I found... the shorts.
773,"00:39:15,270","00:39:16,539",Whoa!
774,"00:39:18,504","00:39:20,835",The pain!
775,"00:39:20,971","00:39:22,642","I'm right behind ya, pal."
776,"00:39:22,777","00:39:24,574","Eh, that's
none too reassuring."
777,"00:39:24,710","00:39:25,710",Nice puppy.
778,"00:39:25,843","00:39:27,044",How's about a bone?
779,"00:39:28,051","00:39:29,251",No dice.
780,"00:39:29,387","00:39:31,251",What about a nice holiday ham?
781,"00:39:31,387","00:39:32,921",He ain't buyin' it.
782,"00:39:33,056","00:39:34,630","- Can't we talk this over, Rover?
- Down, Beethoven!"
783,"00:39:34,654","00:39:37,087",Ooh! The kids are here.
784,"00:39:39,659","00:39:41,223","Give it to me, Charles."
785,"00:39:44,801","00:39:47,266","- Here you go, Bugs.
- Yeah! Thanks, kid."
786,"00:39:47,401","00:39:49,037",Shoo! Shoo!
787,"00:39:49,172","00:39:51,073",Bad dog!
788,"00:39:51,208","00:39:56,042","That is the last time I'm ever
working with dogs or children!"
789,"00:39:56,178","00:39:58,298","-  Bye-bye!
-  Hey, where're you going?"
790,"00:39:58,380","00:40:00,147","Well, uh, you see,"
791,"00:40:00,282","00:40:02,330","the Looney Tunes have a big
basketball game comin' up,"
792,"00:40:02,354","00:40:04,316","and, uh, your dad's gonna play."
793,"00:40:04,451","00:40:05,551",All right!
794,"00:40:05,687","00:40:07,986",Yeah! But don't tell anybody.
795,"00:40:09,861","00:40:12,463","Isn't it weird that these
kids have, like, no reaction"
796,"00:40:12,598","00:40:14,791","to an animated rabbit
and duck in their house?"
797,"00:40:14,927","00:40:18,202","No, Raven. There's nothing weird about
seein' a bunch of cartoon characters"
798,"00:40:18,337","00:40:22,132","stealing your dad's stuff and then
telling you not to say anything about it!"

This is it!"
800,"00:40:25,204","00:40:27,207","I don't know where
you are, Michael,"
801,"00:40:27,342","00:40:29,741","but wherever you are, you
obviously enjoy being there!"
802,"00:40:29,877","00:40:31,612",More than spendin' time with me!
803,"00:40:31,748","00:40:33,447","You better hope this
Jordan character"
804,"00:40:33,583","00:40:35,351",still knows how to play hoops.
805,"00:40:35,487","00:40:37,280","You and me both, brudduh."
806,"00:40:37,415","00:40:40,649","Listen, how's
this for a new team name,"
807,"00:40:40,784","00:40:42,154","""The Ducks!"""
808,"00:40:42,290","00:40:43,493",Please!

Mouse organization"
810,"00:40:45,058","00:40:47,497","would name their
team, ""The Ducks?"""
811,"00:40:47,633","00:40:49,725","So sue me.
It's just a suggestion."
812,"00:40:54,800","00:40:56,097",You're doin' it!
813,"00:40:56,232","00:40:58,567",You're becoming mighty! Go!

815,"00:41:00,202","00:41:03,207",Ha! That's two more butts!
816,"00:41:03,343","00:41:06,610","I don't
hear it! What is it?"
817,"00:41:06,746","00:41:09,266","-  Come on!
- Now shake it, - keep on sweating!"
818,"00:41:09,813","00:41:11,218","Eh, guys?"
819,"00:41:11,353","00:41:12,521",Yeah?
820,"00:41:12,657","00:41:15,350","Look who's finally
ready to play!"
821,"00:41:22,767","00:41:24,502","Let's see if I remember
how to do this."
822,"00:41:31,504","00:41:32,504",Yes!
823,"00:41:55,935","00:41:56,963",Michael!

825,"00:42:01,702","00:42:05,407","Oh!  Thank God,
you're all right! You're all right!"
826,"00:42:05,542","00:42:08,071",Oh-ho-ho. I was so worried.
827,"00:42:08,207","00:42:10,744","Come on, Stan. Don't
hug me, please."
828,"00:42:10,879","00:42:12,441","- Sorry.
- What are you doin' here?"
829,"00:42:12,576","00:42:14,917","I gotta take you back.
You've got baseball practice."
830,"00:42:15,053","00:42:17,617","I can't. I'm helpin' my friends
in their basketball game."
831,"00:42:17,752","00:42:19,450",Let me get this straight...
832,"00:42:19,585","00:42:21,664","First, Michael quits the NBA
to play Minor League baseball."
833,"00:42:21,688","00:42:25,223","Now he's quitting baseball to
play cartoon basketball for free?"
834,"00:42:25,358","00:42:28,732","Yup! His career is really
going places in this film!"
835,"00:42:28,867","00:42:30,926","If it doesn't bother you,
it doesn't bother me."
836,"00:42:31,062","00:42:33,546","I mean... Let me help! Let me help! I
could help! I can help! Let me help!"
837,"00:42:33,570","00:42:35,035",What can you do?
838,"00:42:35,170","00:42:37,271","Well, you know, I mean...
I may not be very tall,"
839,"00:42:37,407","00:42:39,134",but I'm slow.
840,"00:42:39,269","00:42:41,776","- And large.
- And a dork."
841,"00:42:41,911","00:42:44,314","I'll do anything,
Michael! Anything!"
842,"00:42:44,449","00:42:46,243","- Anything?
- Anything."
843,"00:42:48,048","00:42:51,215","Come here. Come
here for a second."
844,"00:42:51,350","00:42:53,420","- Sit right here.
-  Okay."
845,"00:42:53,555","00:42:55,055","Okay, no problem."
846,"00:42:55,190","00:42:58,954","All right! All right.
Let's go, team!"
847,"00:42:59,089","00:43:01,689","You know, if somebody gets injured,
we could see a lot of minutes."
848,"00:43:01,761","00:43:03,898",I'm a cheerleader.
849,"00:43:15,774","00:43:17,308",Holds up.
850,"00:43:17,444","00:43:19,775","So the big game takes
place in Looney Tunes land?"

852,"00:43:21,447","00:43:23,379","So, why'd they call
this movie Space Jam?"
853,"00:43:23,514","00:43:25,385","When the Jam doesn't
take place in space?"
854,"00:43:25,521","00:43:27,835","Because ""Looney Tunes Land In
The Middle Of The Planet Jam"""
855,"00:43:27,859","00:43:30,089","doesn't have a nice
ring to it, Raven."
856,"00:43:37,267","00:43:38,627",Yes!

that, thank you."
947,"00:48:40,102","00:48:42,029","Here, don't try this at home!"
948,"00:48:46,075","00:48:47,775","- Wai...
- You goin' somewhere?"
949,"00:48:47,910","00:48:49,443","May I remind you, sir,"
950,"00:48:49,579","00:48:52,579","that physical violence is
patently against the rules?"
951,"00:48:52,714","00:48:54,084",Yeow!
952,"00:48:54,219","00:48:58,087","Did you order original
recipe or extra crispy?"
953,"00:49:02,058","00:49:03,753","- Let's go. Come on.
- Me?"
954,"00:49:03,888","00:49:05,991","- Oh. Boy. I'm ready. I can do this.
- Mouse?"
955,"00:49:06,126","00:49:07,891",You picked the mouse?
956,"00:49:08,027","00:49:09,704","I love basketball.
I've always loved basketball."
957,"00:49:09,728","00:49:11,566","- Do you love basketball?
-  Uh-huh."
958,"00:49:11,701","00:49:13,213","- You're big. I bet you're good at basketball.
-  Right."
959,"00:49:13,237","00:49:14,510","I'm small, but I'll
try really, really hard"
960,"00:49:14,534","00:49:15,995","- to be good at basketball.
- Okay."
961,"00:49:16,131","00:49:17,779","- Really I will. I always try hard.
- Yeah."
962,"00:49:17,803","00:49:18,241","My mom says ""Try your best
in everything you do..."""
963,"00:49:22,342","00:49:25,977","- Try to get by me, doll.
- ""Doll?"""
964,"00:49:26,113","00:49:27,611",- Whoa!

969,"00:49:37,324","00:49:39,026","- Nice shot.
- Thanks, Bugs."
970,"00:49:39,161","00:49:42,027","Hmm? Where's your defense, boy?"
971,"00:49:42,162","00:49:43,491",I got you right here.

974,"00:49:48,767","00:49:51,371","- Some sorbet, perhaps?
-  Yeah!"
975,"00:50:06,382","00:50:07,389",Half-time.
976,"00:50:09,858","00:50:11,889",Holey putty tat.
977,"00:50:12,024","00:50:13,800","-  We're better than them.
-  Yeah, man."
978,"00:50:13,824","00:50:15,463","We got it goin'
on. One more half"
979,"00:50:15,599","00:50:17,307","- and we're on our way, man.
-  We got 'em, boys."
980,"00:50:17,331","00:50:19,892","Moron Mountain, here we come."
981,"00:50:20,028","00:50:21,828","We're
gonna be slaves."
982,"00:50:21,964","00:50:23,244","Come on. Guys.
Keep your head up."
983,"00:50:23,370","00:50:24,610",Got whole another half to play.
984,"00:50:38,756","00:50:40,387",It's the boss.
985,"00:50:41,652","00:50:44,021","Hello, Mr. Swackhammer."
986,"00:50:44,156","00:50:45,922",All right.
987,"00:50:46,058","00:50:48,828","Not bad for the first half,
but we gotta keep this up."
988,"00:50:48,963","00:50:50,396","Hey, no problem."
989,"00:50:50,532","00:50:51,838","- We stole the...
- We stole the talent, boss"
990,"00:50:51,862","00:50:53,360","from the best
players in the NBA."
991,"00:50:53,496","00:50:54,862",From the NBA?
992,"00:50:54,998","00:50:56,415","And it was little, uh,
uh, uh, grand-mama."
993,"00:50:56,439","00:50:58,108","- What was it, Larry Johnson?
- Shut up!"
994,"00:51:00,041","00:51:01,936",I smell something.
995,"00:51:02,071","00:51:03,947","It's probably all that
nasty cigar smoke."
996,"00:51:04,083","00:51:05,575","We have been
playing really hard."
997,"00:51:05,711","00:51:07,645","-  Yeah.
- Not you, you idiot."
998,"00:51:10,185","00:51:12,012",It's coming from over here.
999,"00:51:12,148","00:51:13,908",-  That locker!
1000,"00:51:13,988","00:51:15,620",Yeah!
1001,"00:51:17,094","00:51:18,694",- Look!
1002,"00:51:18,830","00:51:20,627",It's the chubby boy.
1003,"00:51:20,763","00:51:22,193",Ah.
1004,"00:51:22,328","00:51:25,261",It smells like a spy.
1005,"00:51:28,305","00:51:29,932","You guys
need a publicist?"
1006,"00:51:30,067","00:51:32,137","- I can make you big.
-  Look."
1007,"00:51:32,273","00:51:34,421","- I know we're down.
-  Oh, yeah, let's hear the story."
1008,"00:51:34,445","00:51:36,571","But I've been in this
situation many times before."
1009,"00:51:36,707","00:51:38,792","-  Oh, this is a piece of work.
- We can still win this thing."
1010,"00:51:38,816","00:51:40,526",- It's not over with. We gotta come together.
1011,"00:51:40,550","00:51:41,755","-  Oh, yeah.
- We gotta believe in ourselves."
1012,"00:51:41,779","00:51:43,219","We can come back
and win this game."
1013,"00:51:43,355","00:51:44,114","Yeah, right.
That's gonna help us."
1014,"00:51:47,620","00:51:48,992","Looks
like Stan just had"
1015,"00:51:49,128","00:51:50,819","a close encounter
with a bug-zapper."
1016,"00:51:50,955","00:51:54,989","The Monstars.
The Monstars!"
1017,"00:52:00,102","00:52:01,145","-  Ooh, that's gotta hurt.
-  You all right, Stan?"
1018,"00:52:01,169","00:52:02,663",The Monstars.
1019,"00:52:02,799","00:52:05,141",The Monstars
1020,"00:52:05,277","00:52:08,204","stole the talent
from the NBA players."
1021,"00:52:11,941","00:52:13,776","So that's what
happened to those guys."
1022,"00:52:13,912","00:52:17,787","I think
we should forfeit."
1023,"00:52:17,923","00:52:19,086","-  Yeah.
- Listen."
1024,"00:52:19,222","00:52:20,852",I didn't get dragged down here
1025,"00:52:20,988","00:52:22,794","just to get my butt whipped
by a bunch of ugly Monstars."
1026,"00:52:22,818","00:52:24,159",I ain't goin' out like that.
1027,"00:52:24,294","00:52:25,754","We're lettin' 'em
push us around."
1028,"00:52:27,231","00:52:28,404","We gotta
fight 'em back."
1029,"00:52:28,428","00:52:29,692",We gotta take it to them.
1030,"00:52:29,828","00:52:31,145","We gotta get right
in their faces."
1031,"00:52:31,169","00:52:33,665",- What do you say?
1032,"00:52:34,873","00:52:36,063",Are you with me or not?
1033,"00:52:42,007","00:52:44,175","Eh, finished? Eh, great
speech an' all, doc."
1034,"00:52:44,311","00:52:45,811","Eh, you had 'em riveted."
1035,"00:52:45,946","00:52:49,180","- But, er, didn't you forget somethin'?
- What?"
1036,"00:52:49,315","00:52:50,880",Your secret stuff.
1037,"00:52:58,795","00:53:00,197",Wow.
1038,"00:53:00,332","00:53:03,233","-  Whoa! Nice deltoids.
- Play along."
1039,"00:53:05,503","00:53:08,236","Eh, stop hogging it, Mike.
We're your teammates."
1040,"00:53:08,372","00:53:11,173",- Secwet stuff?
1041,"00:53:11,309","00:53:12,605",Secret Stuff?
1042,"00:53:12,740","00:53:15,005","You wouldn't hold
out on us, would you?"
1043,"00:53:15,140","00:53:17,220","No, I mean, I didn't think
you guys really needed it."
1044,"00:53:17,305","00:53:20,380","I mean, you're so tough.
You're competitive."
1045,"00:53:20,516","00:53:23,647","We're also chicken,
son. We need it bad."
1046,"00:53:23,783","00:53:24,998","- Hey!
- Can I have a little drink?"
1047,"00:53:25,022","00:53:26,754",I'd like some of that.
1048,"00:53:26,890","00:53:28,193","- If I could just...
-  Yeah. Can I have a sip, please?"
1049,"00:53:28,217","00:53:29,535","You know,
this goes against"
1050,"00:53:29,559","00:53:31,761","everything they taught
me in health class."
1051,"00:53:31,897","00:53:32,959",Do you wanna win or not?
1052,"00:53:33,094","00:53:34,429",Bottoms up.
1053,"00:53:36,430","00:53:38,194",- Yummy.
1054,"00:53:38,330","00:53:40,347","All right. How about we go out
and kick some alien butt, huh?"
1055,"00:53:40,371","00:53:42,298","Let's go! How about
it, huh? Ready?"
1056,"00:53:42,433","00:53:43,702",Yeah.
1057,"00:53:45,669","00:53:46,705",Let's go!
1058,"00:53:50,472","00:53:52,773","Check out all those classic
Looney Tunes characters."
1059,"00:53:52,909","00:53:54,510",There's lady head turtle body.
1060,"00:53:54,646","00:53:56,043",And the chicken feet man.
1061,"00:53:56,178","00:53:58,845","Whoa, this whole
crowd is freaky, yo."
1062,"00:53:58,981","00:54:00,355",Looks like them animators just
1063,"00:54:00,491","00:54:02,818","copy-and-pasted these
fools over and over."
1064,"00:54:02,954","00:54:05,087","I never
noticed that before."
1065,"00:54:05,222","00:54:07,559","This weirdo is over here,
here, here, and here."
1066,"00:54:07,695","00:54:09,755","And these cats, and
this guy, and her?"
1067,"00:54:09,891","00:54:11,124","This is crazy, man!"
1068,"00:54:11,259","00:54:13,963","Okay. Okay. Sorry.
Back to the movie."
1069,"00:54:28,086","00:54:30,746",I'm open!
1070,"00:54:30,881","00:54:32,619","-  Coming through.
- Hey."
1071,"00:54:34,649","00:54:35,649",Bugs.
1072,"00:54:37,159","00:54:38,251",Special delivery.
1073,"00:54:39,793","00:54:41,494",-  Great!
1074,"00:54:41,630","00:54:44,125",- Whoa! Boo.
1075,"00:54:50,272","00:54:52,133","Eh, nice kaboom, Wile E."
1076,"00:54:57,873","00:54:59,306",Again with the guns?
1077,"00:54:59,441","00:55:01,747","Don't worry, Mom and Dad.
I'll take care of it."
1078,"00:55:14,591","00:55:16,711","-  Let's teach them a lesson.
-  Ah, man."
1079,"00:55:19,663","00:55:21,267",Hey...
1080,"00:55:21,403","00:55:23,098","Oh, man, look at that one."
1081,"00:55:25,239","00:55:26,105",Nice butt!
1082,"00:55:29,577","00:55:31,205",Dunk.
1083,"00:55:31,340","00:55:32,817","You ain't
going anywhere, chump."
1084,"00:55:32,841","00:55:34,617",Hey!
1085,"00:55:34,753","00:55:37,153","-  Er, going up.
-  You're mine, boy! Ooh."
1086,"00:55:38,949","00:55:41,424","- Slammy!
-  Yes!"
1087,"00:55:42,618","00:55:43,618",Hello!
1088,"00:55:43,720","00:55:45,153",Cyborg's fun fact.
1089,"00:55:45,288","00:55:47,924","Pepe Le Pew was originally
named, ""Stinky."""
1090,"00:55:48,060","00:55:51,031","Hey, he shares the
same nickname as Robin."
1091,"00:55:51,166","00:55:52,166",Two points.
1092,"00:56:00,940","00:56:02,379","Ooh,
this will be good."
1093,"00:56:04,379","00:56:06,907","Yo, check out that butt!"
1094,"00:56:18,361","00:56:20,221","- Okay, birdie.
- Uh-oh."
1095,"00:56:38,747","00:56:40,649","I'm gonna step
outside for a minute"
1096,"00:56:40,784","00:56:43,580","to get some fresh air.
Cyborg, you should join me."
1097,"00:56:43,715","00:56:44,784","No, thanks. I'm good."
1098,"00:56:46,214","00:56:47,417","- Ow!
- It wasn't a question."
1099,"00:56:47,552","00:56:48,623","Okay, okay."
1100,"00:56:51,761","00:56:53,758","Here's the plan. I'm
going to search their ship"
1101,"00:56:53,894","00:56:55,762","- while you be on the lookout.
- Fine."
1102,"00:57:06,439","00:57:08,485","What are you doing? You're
supposed to be on the lookout."
1103,"00:57:08,509","00:57:11,405","Yeah, and I'm looking out to see
what's inside this cool spaceship."
1104,"00:57:11,540","00:57:13,843","Fine. Then help me search
for clues that will expose"
1105,"00:57:13,978","00:57:15,218",what these aliens are planning.
1106,"00:57:15,311","00:57:17,014","They're not planning
anything, dude."
1107,"00:57:17,149","00:57:19,084","All that's in here is
stuff from the movie."
1108,"00:57:19,220","00:57:20,220",Aha!
1109,"00:57:21,959","00:57:25,621","Perhaps their secret lies in
this bottle of secret stuff!"
1110,"00:57:25,757","00:57:27,223",I wouldn't do that.
1111,"00:57:27,358","00:57:29,432","That water has been in
there for like 25 years."
1112,"00:57:29,568","00:57:31,930","There's a secret in
here. You'll see!"
1113,"00:57:34,964","00:57:37,133",Must get to secret.
1114,"00:57:42,504","00:57:45,610","Okay. But I wonder
what's behind this door."
1115,"00:57:45,745","00:57:47,946","Wait. It says ""Do not open."""
1116,"00:57:48,081","00:57:50,949","Because they're obviously
hiding something."
1117,"00:57:52,650","00:57:53,650",You were right!
1118,"00:57:56,887","00:57:58,356",Ow! Ow! Ow!
1119,"00:57:58,491","00:58:00,125",I was right.
1120,"00:58:00,261","00:58:02,302","Will you give it up, dude?
They're not hiding anything."
1121,"00:58:02,326","00:58:04,291","Then what about this
examination chair?"
1122,"00:58:04,427","00:58:05,867","I'm sure they're
planning to use this"
1123,"00:58:05,933","00:58:07,866","to perform weird
experiments on us,"
1124,"00:58:08,002","00:58:10,097","- like replacing our bodies.
- No, man."
1125,"00:58:10,232","00:58:12,300",That's just Daffy's chair. See?
1126,"00:58:15,311","00:58:16,843",Ain't I a stinker?
1127,"00:58:20,482","00:58:21,582","Oh, good. They're back."
1128,"00:58:21,717","00:58:23,146","Now we can watch
more of the movie."
1129,"00:58:25,789","00:58:27,629","All right, guys, we're
right back in this game."
1130,"00:58:27,751","00:58:29,567","- Come on, now, let's play some tough defense."
1131,"00:58:29,591","00:58:31,393",Why didn't you get this guy?
1132,"00:58:31,529","00:58:33,152",He's a baseball player.
1133,"00:58:33,288","00:58:34,563","Yeah, boss, a baseball player."
1134,"00:58:34,698","00:58:37,164","Looks like a basketball
player to me."
1135,"00:58:37,300","00:58:38,733","Yeah, me too."
1136,"00:58:38,868","00:58:40,963","Shh! He's the one I
want for Moron Mountain."
1137,"00:58:41,099","00:58:42,231",- Hey.
1138,"00:58:44,803","00:58:46,532",Are you talkin' to me?
1139,"00:58:46,668","00:58:48,670","Yeah I'm talkin' to you.
You want a piece of me?"
1140,"00:58:48,805","00:58:50,078",Come and get it.
1141,"00:58:51,543","00:58:52,549",Uh-oh!
1142,"00:58:53,846","00:58:56,575",What did you have in mind?
1143,"00:58:56,711","00:58:58,645","What about we raise the
stakes a little bit?"
1144,"00:58:58,781","00:58:59,985",Mm-hmm.
1145,"00:59:00,883","00:59:02,386",Interesting.
1146,"00:59:02,521","00:59:04,090",Gross!
1147,"00:59:04,226","00:59:06,660","He just blew secondhand smoke
in Michael Jordan's face!"
1148,"00:59:06,796","00:59:10,065","He is the worst of
all the villains."
1149,"00:59:10,200","00:59:11,490",If we win
1150,"00:59:11,626","00:59:13,366","you give the NBA players
their talent back."
1151,"00:59:13,502","00:59:15,297",But what if we win?
1152,"00:59:16,839","00:59:18,700","- If you win?
-  Uh-huh."
1153,"00:59:18,835","00:59:20,240",You get me.
1154,"00:59:20,375","00:59:21,543","Good deal, boss."
1155,"00:59:21,679","00:59:22,720","-  I like that!
- Eh, doc"
1156,"00:59:22,744","00:59:24,075",you think that's a good ide...
1157,"00:59:27,214","00:59:29,179","You'll be
our star attraction..."
1158,"00:59:31,018","00:59:33,221","You'll sign autographs
all day long."
1159,"00:59:35,092","00:59:38,023","And play one-on-one with
the paying customers."
1160,"00:59:38,159","00:59:40,189","How does he expect
Michael to sign autographs"
1161,"00:59:40,325","00:59:41,895","and play basketball
at the same time."
1162,"00:59:42,030","00:59:44,031","Really? You're still
asking questions, girl?"
1163,"00:59:44,166","00:59:46,333","Don't you know by now that
none of this makes sense?"
1164,"00:59:46,469","00:59:48,264",It's Looney! Looney!
1165,"00:59:50,305","00:59:51,305",Deal.
1166,"00:59:52,776","00:59:54,216","-  All right!
-  Yeah!"
1167,"00:59:54,307","00:59:56,067","The boss
don't playin' do he?"
1168,"00:59:58,574","01:00:00,644","I don't think you should
have done that, doc."
1169,"01:00:00,780","01:00:02,113",I have faith in my team.
1170,"01:00:04,881","01:00:07,282",Crush 'em!
1171,"01:00:07,418","01:00:09,483","It's feedin'
time, boys!"
1172,"01:00:13,864","01:00:15,624","Ye-ga, er,
ba-bee, er, ba-bee..."
1173,"01:00:15,734","01:00:18,691","There's butts number
nine and ten, yo!"
1174,"01:00:18,826","01:00:21,669","I'll tell you brother,
this match is gettin' ugly!"
1175,"01:00:21,805","01:00:24,799","Oh, yeah! There's
a chop to the head!"
1176,"01:00:24,934","01:00:26,132",A body slam!
1177,"01:00:26,267","01:00:28,206",Another chop! A kick!
1178,"01:00:28,342","01:00:31,109","It's not looking good for
the Tune Squad, brother!"
1179,"01:00:35,414","01:00:39,822","But Mommy, I don't want
to go to school today."
1180,"01:00:39,957","01:00:43,583","I want to stay home and
bake cookies with you."
1181,"01:00:45,793","01:00:47,737","-  This is gonna be fun!
-  I'm open! I'm open!"
1182,"01:00:47,761","01:00:49,224",Lola! Lola! Heads up!
1183,"01:00:49,360","01:00:52,359","-  Oh!
-  Belly flop!"
1184,"01:00:52,495","01:00:54,664","This butt fills
half the screen, yo!"
1185,"01:00:55,936","01:00:59,636","Oh, my! Bugs!"
1186,"01:01:00,875","01:01:03,002","- Bugs!
- Is this your man?"
1187,"01:01:04,679","01:01:05,977",Are you okay?
1188,"01:01:06,113","01:01:10,176","Me? Oh, yeah, I'm
fine. Are you okay?"
1189,"01:01:10,311","01:01:12,683","Oh, Bugs... thank you."
1190,"01:01:12,819","01:01:14,989",Oh... it was nothin'!
1191,"01:01:15,124","01:01:18,226","That was the nicest thing
anyone's ever done for me."
1192,"01:01:26,500","01:01:28,382","I need a break from all of
this intense sports action."
1193,"01:01:28,406","01:01:29,704","You ain't kidding, mama."
1194,"01:01:29,840","01:01:31,112","All this suspense
over who's gonna win"
1195,"01:01:31,136","01:01:32,600",has got my tummy tied in knots.
1196,"01:01:32,735","01:01:35,475","I know how it ends and
I'm still feeling anxious."
1197,"01:01:36,676","01:01:38,009","Dude, bad vibes."
1198,"01:01:38,144","01:01:39,842","I know what will
calm those nerves."
1199,"01:01:39,977","01:01:41,410","Snack time, baby!"
1200,"01:01:43,446","01:01:45,315","Help yourself to
whatever you want."
1201,"01:01:54,189","01:01:56,089","Now, this is mine!"
1202,"01:01:56,225","01:01:57,866","Mmm, peanut butter."
1203,"01:02:03,540","01:02:05,741",Here we go.
1204,"01:02:05,877","01:02:07,904","Can you reach those
chips for me, please?"
1205,"01:02:08,040","01:02:09,438",Get it yourself.
1206,"01:02:09,574","01:02:12,540","But you're so tall and
your hands are so big."
1207,"01:02:14,881","01:02:16,848",Really? You mean it?
1208,"01:02:16,983","01:02:18,751",You're also a strong leader.
1209,"01:02:18,887","01:02:20,449",And we can appreciate someone
1210,"01:02:20,585","01:02:23,119","who forces others to
act against their will."
1211,"01:02:23,255","01:02:24,921",You would make a great Nerdluck.
1212,"01:02:25,057","01:02:27,326",Wow! You really mean that?
1213,"01:02:27,461","01:02:29,400","-  Yeah, totally.
-  Oooh, you'd be great."
1214,"01:02:29,424","01:02:30,661","Did you hear that, Titans?"
1215,"01:02:30,796","01:02:32,098",Whatever.
1216,"01:02:33,228","01:02:34,395",You know what?
1217,"01:02:34,531","01:02:36,970","Maybe you aliens aren't
so bad after all."
1218,"01:02:37,106","01:02:38,971","Told you there was
nothing to worry about."
1219,"01:02:39,107","01:02:41,775",Now let's get back to the movie!
1220,"01:02:43,838","01:02:46,881","I could have
been a contender!"
1221,"01:02:47,016","01:02:49,912","The Monstars!
The Monstars!"
1222,"01:02:50,048","01:02:51,381",Clear!
1223,"01:03:06,935","01:03:11,265",Okay. We need a fifth player.
1224,"01:03:11,400","01:03:12,775","Hey, Coach, listen."
1225,"01:03:12,910","01:03:14,468","You got anymore of
that secret stuff?"
1226,"01:03:14,603","01:03:16,009","I think it's
startin' to wear off."
1227,"01:03:16,145","01:03:18,740","It didn't wear off.
It was just water."
1228,"01:03:18,876","01:03:22,011","You guys had the ""special
stuff"" inside of you all along."
1229,"01:03:22,147","01:03:23,783",Yeah. Yeah. I-I knew that.
1230,"01:03:23,919","01:03:25,949","But, listen, you got any more?"
1231,"01:03:26,084","01:03:28,724","-  Yah, I'll get a double one.
-  Can I have some too?"
1232,"01:03:29,825","01:03:31,355","- Stan?
- Yeah! Eh, m-me?"
1233,"01:03:32,930","01:03:34,387",- You're in at center.
1234,"01:03:34,523","01:03:36,196","Just guard the big guy, okay?"
1235,"01:03:36,332","01:03:38,757","Guard him? Guard him? Guard
him? I'll smother him!"
1236,"01:03:38,893","01:03:40,835","I'll be all over him
like a cheap suit!"
1237,"01:03:40,970","01:03:43,099","I'll be on him
like stink on rice!"
1238,"01:03:43,234","01:03:44,533","I tell you, he's goin' down!"
1239,"01:03:51,573","01:03:52,878","Michael, over here! Over here!"
1240,"01:03:53,014","01:03:54,847","Over here, I'm open! I'm open!"
1241,"01:03:54,982","01:03:56,246",Come on! Come on!
1242,"01:03:56,382","01:03:58,815","Now, you got
it! Get the fat one."
1243,"01:04:03,019","01:04:04,019",Yes!
1244,"01:04:06,029","01:04:07,990",Ah-ha! Nice shot!
1245,"01:04:08,126","01:04:09,965",Big man pancake.
1246,"01:04:12,531","01:04:14,904","Haha! Look they made
a ""Flat Stanley."""
1247,"01:04:19,638","01:04:21,318","Let's
get him outta here!"
1248,"01:04:42,058","01:04:42,926",Eww!
1249,"01:04:44,995","01:04:46,364","Oh, my!"
1250,"01:04:53,302","01:04:54,336",How'd he do that?
1251,"01:04:54,471","01:04:56,138","Oh, anybody could do that, doc."
1252,"01:04:56,273","01:04:58,545",Even you. Watch this.
1253,"01:04:58,680","01:04:59,711",Watch this.
1254,"01:04:59,847","01:05:01,275",See? No sweat.
1255,"01:05:01,411","01:05:03,315",This is Looney Tune Land.
1256,"01:05:06,751","01:05:10,092","Ten seconds to go? Thanks
for tellin' me... doc."
1257,"01:05:10,227","01:05:13,224","I hate to be the bearer
of bad news, Your Airness,"
1258,"01:05:13,360","01:05:15,192","but if you don't
find a fifth player,"
1259,"01:05:15,328","01:05:17,756",your team will forfeit the game.
1260,"01:05:17,892","01:05:19,226","- Now the rules apply?
- Forfeit?"
1261,"01:05:19,362","01:05:21,131","Precisely, Sir Altitude."
1262,"01:05:21,266","01:05:23,039",No way. We'll find someone.
1263,"01:05:28,040","01:05:29,507","Whoa, whoa, whoa!"
1264,"01:05:29,642","01:05:31,972","I didn't know Dan Ackroyd
was in this picture!"
1265,"01:05:32,108","01:05:34,279",Hey!
1266,"01:05:34,415","01:05:36,645","Perhaps I could be
of some assistance."
1267,"01:05:37,985","01:05:39,914",That's our fifth guy.
1268,"01:05:40,050","01:05:42,622","Let's go. Now you get to
live up your dream. Let's go."
1269,"01:05:42,757","01:05:44,724",All right.
1270,"01:05:44,859","01:05:47,101","- All right. We need to score two points...
- Here's how I see it."
1271,"01:05:47,125","01:05:48,458","- Duck...
- Yes?"
1272,"01:05:48,593","01:05:50,392","You kick it in to
the girl bunny..."
1273,"01:05:50,527","01:05:51,725","- Yeah?
- Down in the post."
1274,"01:05:51,861","01:05:53,498","You dish it back out
to the guy bunny."
1275,"01:05:53,634","01:05:55,548","- Got it!
- You swing it around to Mike over here."
1276,"01:05:55,572","01:05:57,612","- Bill, Bill, Bill, Bill.
- You go to the hole and dominate!"
1277,"01:05:57,636","01:05:59,503","- We're on defense.
-  Oh, yeah."
1278,"01:05:59,638","01:06:02,105","Whoa, ho-ho.
I don't play defense."
1279,"01:06:02,240","01:06:04,751","- Typical.
- All right, you're gonna have to listen to Mike on this."
1280,"01:06:04,775","01:06:06,677","- Listen up.
- Somebody steal the ball,"
1281,"01:06:06,813","01:06:09,979","get it to me, and I'll score
before the time runs out."
1282,"01:06:10,114","01:06:12,354","- Don't lose that confidence! Okay!
- I won't. All right."
1283,"01:06:12,451","01:06:13,771","Paws and wings in
here! All right!"
1284,"01:06:13,854","01:06:15,024",Let's go.
1285,"01:06:20,923","01:06:24,766","This is why I was born.
I thrive on pressure."
1286,"01:06:24,901","01:06:26,631","Excuse me? Uh, uh, s-sorry!"
1287,"01:06:26,767","01:06:28,573","Yo, yo, yo. Yo. Easy on the
trousers, Daf. Easy, man. Easy."
1288,"01:06:28,597","01:06:30,400","Pardon me. Uhm, Mr. Murray,"
1289,"01:06:30,536","01:06:32,140","something's really
been buggin' me."
1290,"01:06:32,275","01:06:35,011","- Yeah?
- Just how did you get here, anyway?"
1291,"01:06:36,176","01:06:37,641",Producer's a friend of mine.
1292,"01:06:37,776","01:06:39,455","Just had a teamster come
and drop me off, you know."
1293,"01:06:39,479","01:06:43,075","Uh-huh. Well,
that's how it goes."
1294,"01:06:43,211","01:06:45,553","Hey, you see this, uh, kind
of chunky fellow over here?"
1295,"01:06:47,117","01:06:48,123",Uh-huh.
1296,"01:06:50,425","01:06:53,126","Yeah. Yeah. Oh. Oh,
that's good! Oh, yes!"
1297,"01:06:53,262","01:06:54,788","All right, let's do
it! You the duck!"
1298,"01:06:54,923","01:06:57,859","Now, let's all play
fair. Here."
1299,"01:06:57,994","01:06:59,963","Yo, spaceman, don't choke
now! Come on, come on."
1300,"01:07:00,098","01:07:02,377","-  Come on. Come on. Come on!
- It's gut check time!"
1301,"01:07:06,008","01:07:07,202",This must be mine.
1302,"01:07:07,338","01:07:08,737",Whoaho-ho!
1303,"01:07:08,872","01:07:10,710","This belongs to me.
I'm goin' this way."
1304,"01:07:10,845","01:07:12,324","- I'm goin' left! I'm goin' left!
- Look left! Look left! Yes!"
1305,"01:07:12,348","01:07:14,413","Whoa-ho-ho! Don't ever
trust an Earthling!"
1306,"01:07:15,818","01:07:17,049",What'cha got?
1307,"01:07:17,184","01:07:19,648",Mike!
1308,"01:07:19,783","01:07:22,252","Get the
rabbit! Get the girl!"
1309,"01:07:22,387","01:07:24,249",Come on! Come on! I'm open!
1310,"01:07:24,385","01:07:25,993",I'm o...!
1311,"01:07:26,128","01:07:28,227","- That's mine!

1312,"01:07:28,363","01:07:29,843","-  Hey!
-  Come on! Ohh!"
1313,"01:07:29,900","01:07:31,097","Bring it on, dude."
1314,"01:07:31,232","01:07:33,630",Whoopsie daisy! Woo-hoo!
1315,"01:07:34,704","01:07:35,704",You're mine!
1316,"01:07:40,505","01:07:42,309",Number twelve with the assist!
1317,"01:07:44,780","01:07:45,780","Mike, I'm open!"
1318,"01:07:48,685","01:07:49,712",Never mind.
1319,"01:08:27,185","01:08:29,425",The Tunes win!!
1320,"01:08:29,560","01:08:32,255","This proves once again that
Michael Jordan is the solution"
1321,"01:08:32,391","01:08:33,789",to all of life's problems!
1322,"01:08:33,924","01:08:36,262","That was a great stretch
for the basket too."
1323,"01:08:36,398","01:08:37,639","You know, you really
got some skills."
1324,"01:08:37,663","01:08:39,797","You might be able
to play in the NBA."
1325,"01:08:39,933","01:08:43,599","Thanks, Mike. I'll
probably quote you on that."
1326,"01:08:43,735","01:08:45,205","But I'm gonna take
this opportunity"
1327,"01:08:45,340","01:08:46,811","to retire from the
game of basketball."
1328,"01:08:46,835","01:08:48,609","- No, come on. Man.
- No."
1329,"01:08:48,745","01:08:51,145","No, I'm gonna retire right now
and that's all there is to it."
1330,"01:08:51,238","01:08:53,640","I'm gonna go out on top,
undefeated and untied."
1331,"01:08:53,776","01:08:55,340",That's the way it's gonna be.
1332,"01:08:55,476","01:08:57,089","You go on ahead and celebrate
with your teammates and..."
1333,"01:08:57,113","01:08:59,051","No, come and help us,
man. Celebrate with us."
1334,"01:08:59,187","01:09:01,835","No, I-I-I'd like to, but I have to
ice down my knees right away, okay?"
1335,"01:09:01,859","01:09:03,325",They're startin' to go.
1336,"01:09:03,460","01:09:05,380","- All right. Good-bye, man.
- All right. See you."
1337,"01:09:06,962","01:09:08,162",Are you sure?
1338,"01:09:08,298","01:09:11,933","Yes. Definitely
sure. Definitely."
1339,"01:09:12,069","01:09:15,260","And the best part of the movie has left
the building, ladies and gentlemen."
1340,"01:09:15,395","01:09:18,172","Thank you, Bill Murray.
You're a national treasure."
1341,"01:09:18,308","01:09:20,037","- Losers!
-  Sorry."
1342,"01:09:20,173","01:09:21,173",Choke artists!
1343,"01:09:21,308","01:09:22,840",He's the real choke artist!
1344,"01:09:22,975","01:09:25,374","Makin' everyone choke on
that nasty smoke like that."
1345,"01:09:25,510","01:09:26,809",Mm-hmm. That ain't right.
1346,"01:09:26,944","01:09:29,480","The party's over!
Get in the spaceship."
1347,"01:09:29,616","01:09:31,148","Why do you take
it from this guy?"
1348,"01:09:31,284","01:09:33,688",Because he's bigger.
1349,"01:09:33,824","01:09:35,152",He's bigger...
1350,"01:09:35,288","01:09:37,860",Than we used to be.
1351,"01:09:37,995","01:09:39,354",Right!
1352,"01:09:39,490","01:09:40,490",What are you doing?
1353,"01:09:40,625","01:09:41,701",Ooooooooh!
1354,"01:09:41,725","01:09:43,588","- Hey! Wait!
- Come here!"
1355,"01:09:43,724","01:09:45,938",- What are you doing? Wait!
1356,"01:09:45,962","01:09:49,766","No! What? Hey! Let
me go!"
1357,"01:10:00,681","01:10:02,244","Had it in ya all the
time, didn't you?"
1358,"01:10:04,388","01:10:07,179","One thing, though.
Pass me the ball, Bugs."
1359,"01:10:07,315","01:10:09,054","You gotta give my friends
their talent back."
1360,"01:10:09,189","01:10:10,189",Oops.
1361,"01:10:10,290","01:10:12,559","- Do we have to?
- Yeah."
1362,"01:10:12,694","01:10:14,632","- Yeah.
- It was part of the deal. Touch the ball."
1363,"01:10:16,196","01:10:18,195","Oh, okay."
1364,"01:10:18,331","01:10:20,230","Uh, fair is fair."
1365,"01:10:20,366","01:10:21,666",There you go. Touch it.
1366,"01:10:28,836","01:10:30,572",That was so much fun.
1367,"01:10:30,707","01:10:33,178",I feel so... insignificant.
1368,"01:10:33,313","01:10:35,077",My clothes don't fit.
1369,"01:10:35,213","01:10:38,450","- What a trip.
-  I'm up for another one."
1370,"01:10:38,586","01:10:40,026","Michael! Do you know
what time it is?"
1371,"01:10:40,117","01:10:41,917","Se-seven
fiftee... Seven fifteen,"
1372,"01:10:41,959","01:10:43,624",quarter past seven.
1373,"01:10:43,760","01:10:45,958","Exactly. You've got a
baseball game in five minutes."
1374,"01:10:46,093","01:10:47,923",Okay. Take this.
1375,"01:10:49,096","01:10:49,930",Is it safe?
1376,"01:10:50,066","01:10:51,432",Yeah. Put in my bag.
1377,"01:10:52,869","01:10:54,301",It's kind of...
1378,"01:10:54,437","01:10:56,329","I really enjoyed
playing with you guys."
1379,"01:10:56,465","01:10:59,008","- You guys got a lot of, uh...
-  Uh-huh?"
1380,"01:10:59,143","01:11:00,804","- A lot of, uh...
-  Yes?"
1381,"01:11:00,939","01:11:03,076","Well, whatever it is,
you got a lot of it."
1382,"01:11:06,047","01:11:07,448","Well, gotta go."
1383,"01:11:08,382","01:11:10,076","- Bugs?
- Eh, Mike?"
1384,"01:11:10,212","01:11:12,714","- Stay outta trouble.
- You know I will."
1385,"01:11:12,849","01:11:14,482",- Come here!
1386,"01:11:14,617","01:11:16,286",- Ohh!
1387,"01:11:17,756","01:11:19,394","Ah-hoo, hoo, hoo!"
1388,"01:11:20,593","01:11:22,622",Wow! What a great movie!
1389,"01:11:22,758","01:11:23,990","You were right, Titans."
1390,"01:11:24,126","01:11:25,934","They didn't come
here to replace us."
1391,"01:11:26,070","01:11:28,400","- Yes, we did.
- What?"
1392,"01:11:28,535","01:11:30,435","Why do you think
we were so eager"
1393,"01:11:30,571","01:11:31,934",to watch the movie with you?
1394,"01:11:32,069","01:11:33,901","We thought you guys
just wanted to hang."
1395,"01:11:34,036","01:11:36,578","No. What we wanted
was your powers."
1396,"01:11:36,713","01:11:40,644","And we can't believe
you just gave 'em to us."
1397,"01:11:40,780","01:11:42,483","We heard you Titans
were dummies."
1398,"01:11:42,618","01:11:44,720","But we didn't realize
you were that dumb."
1399,"01:11:47,083","01:11:49,289",Yeah. Stupid.
1400,"01:11:49,424","01:11:50,653",Okay. You've had your fun.
1401,"01:11:50,788","01:11:52,057",Now give us back our powers.
1402,"01:11:52,192","01:11:53,362",You got it!
1403,"01:11:56,594","01:11:58,631",We're the Titans now!
1404,"01:12:50,548","01:12:51,949",Where are we?
1405,"01:12:52,084","01:12:54,621","Is it just me or does
this place look familiar?"
1406,"01:12:55,487","01:12:56,788",See!
1407,"01:12:56,923","01:12:58,592","I knew those aliens
couldn't be trusted!"
1408,"01:22:55,087","01:22:56,849","Well, that's all, folks!"
1409,"01:22:56,985","01:22:59,791","Eh, be-eh that's my
line. Eh, be-eh that's..."
1410,"01:22:59,926","01:23:01,320","Step aside, babe."
1411,"01:23:01,456","01:23:03,124",Let a star do this.
1412,"01:23:03,259","01:23:04,626",That's all... Whoa!
1413,"01:23:04,761","01:23:06,628","That's all, folks!"
1414,"01:23:08,462","01:23:09,664",Can I go home now?
