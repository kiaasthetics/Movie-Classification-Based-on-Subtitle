10,"00:01:29,923","00:01:32,597","- Sometimes they make fun of me.
- Hmm."
11,"00:01:36,597","00:01:39,066","- Is that real?
- Yes."
12,"00:01:39,224","00:01:42,353",It's real. Everything here is real.

20,"00:02:10,756","00:02:14,306",He looks like a very brave fighter.
21,"00:02:14,676","00:02:16,804","No, he's just a kid."
22,"00:02:16,887","00:02:18,184",He can't do anything.
23,"00:02:18,972","00:02:21,191","He might look different,"
24,"00:02:24,436","00:02:26,859",but he can do great things.

26,"00:02:32,361","00:02:36,707","You just have to look at it

behind the legend of NINJAGOÂ®?"
33,"00:03:06,311","00:03:08,359","- No.
- I will tell you."
34,"00:03:08,522","00:03:12,493","But to truly see it,
you must forget"
35,"00:03:12,651","00:03:14,153",everything you know.
36,"00:03:16,113","00:03:18,741",And see things in a new way.

63,"00:04:31,605","00:04:33,653","You better stay right there.
Don't you dare come out!"
64,"00:04:33,857","00:04:36,576","At least until our
Secret Ninja Force steps in."
65,"00:04:36,818","00:04:38,536",Thank goodness for those Ninjas.
66,"00:04:38,695","00:04:40,413","But who are these
Secret Ninjas, Robin?"
67,"00:04:40,572","00:04:41,869",We have so many questions.
68,"00:04:42,073","00:04:43,916",Burning questions!

one to awesome?"
71,"00:04:48,955","00:04:50,002",I'm not gonna lie.
72,"00:04:50,207","00:04:51,925",I'm awesome!
73,"00:04:52,542","00:04:53,543",Earth Ninja.
74,"00:04:53,710","00:04:55,587",When will he upgrade to digital?
75,"00:04:55,796","00:04:56,843","No, I would never do that."
76,"00:04:58,507","00:04:59,554",Ice Ninja.
77,"00:04:59,716","00:05:02,139",Is he a real boy or a robot?
78,"00:05:02,344","00:05:04,517",How dare you. I'm a wild teen.
79,"00:05:05,013","00:05:06,139",Lightning Ninja.
80,"00:05:06,348","00:05:08,442",Is he the bravest ninja of them all?
81,"00:05:09,851","00:05:11,444",I'll take that as a yes.
82,"00:05:11,978","00:05:13,070",Water Ninja.
83,"00:05:13,271","00:05:16,115","She's a girl and a ninja!
Can she really have it all?"
84,"00:05:16,274","00:05:18,777",You fellas need to inform yourselves
85,"00:05:19,861","00:05:21,238",of where we're at culturally.
86,"00:05:21,655","00:05:23,828",And finally the Green Ninja.
87,"00:05:24,741","00:05:26,539","He fights in the air,"
88,"00:05:26,701","00:05:27,918",on the ground
89,"00:05:28,078","00:05:30,706","and in the kitchen
with a refrigerator."
90,"00:05:31,039","00:05:32,632",But what is he hiding?
91,"00:05:32,833","00:05:34,380",And who is he really?
92,"00:05:34,584","00:05:36,006",Local birthdays!

98,"00:05:48,932","00:05:50,934",Must be tough to be that kid.
99,"00:06:03,655","00:06:04,656",Hello?
100,"00:06:07,742","00:06:08,743",Hello.
101,"00:06:09,953","00:06:11,205",What do you want?
102,"00:06:12,163","00:06:14,461","- Uh, you called me.
- Hang on a second."
103,"00:06:16,084","00:06:18,553","I must have butt dialed you.
Who is this?"
104,"00:06:18,712","00:06:20,089",It's Lloyd.
105,"00:06:21,131","00:06:24,260","- Lloyd Garmadon, your son.
- No."
106,"00:06:24,634","00:06:27,308","My son is totally bald
and has no teeth."
107,"00:06:27,512","00:06:30,015","Yeah, well, surprise.
I'm not a baby anymore."
108,"00:06:30,181","00:06:31,182",Duly noted.
109,"00:06:31,308","00:06:32,855","How old are you?
You're seven, right? You're seven."
110,"00:06:33,018","00:06:34,440","- Sixteen.
- Huh."
111,"00:06:34,644","00:06:35,941",Just add nine to that.
112,"00:06:36,104","00:06:37,105","- Well, good talk, son.
- Wait."
113,"00:06:37,272","00:06:39,616",Are you sure there isn't a special reason
114,"00:06:39,774","00:06:41,868",why you might have called me today?
115,"00:06:42,027","00:06:43,028",On this day.
116,"00:06:43,194","00:06:45,367",Specifically today.
117,"00:06:45,530","00:06:48,283","Look, I didn't call you.
My butt called you."
118,"00:06:48,408","00:06:50,081",Oh.
119,"00:06:50,535","00:06:52,503","Well, no time to chat.
Sorry, Daddy's got to go to work."
120,"00:06:52,621","00:06:54,123","- Gotta get that Green Ninja.
- Yeah."
121,"00:06:54,247","00:06:56,090","Glad the teeth finally came in.
Bye-bye."
122,"00:06:57,834","00:07:01,008",Lloyd! Good morning!
123,"00:07:01,421","00:07:04,721","Mom, hey, um, here's a thought."
124,"00:07:04,883","00:07:07,807",What if I didn't go to school today?
125,"00:07:08,011","00:07:10,560","What? Oh, no! You don't want
to miss school, honey."
126,"00:07:10,722","00:07:12,190",These are the best years of your life.
127,"00:07:12,432","00:07:15,686","Um, have you...
have you been to high school?"
128,"00:07:15,852","00:07:17,229","'Cause, uh..."
129,"00:07:17,395","00:07:19,614",It's judgey. Pretty judgey.
130,"00:07:19,814","00:07:23,159","Oh, honey. You just need to give them
a chance to see the real you."
131,"00:07:23,401","00:07:27,747","Yeah, I don't think I can actually
show people the real me."
132,"00:07:28,073","00:07:29,074",That's not true.
133,"00:07:29,157","00:07:32,661","All you've got to do is just show them
the person you are on the inside."
134,"00:07:33,119","00:07:34,371",Right here.
135,"00:07:34,537","00:07:36,289",Where it matters most.
136,"00:07:36,498","00:07:39,593","Oh, and also don't forget, if your dad
attacks the city again today,"
137,"00:07:39,793","00:07:40,794",just be sure to...
138,"00:07:40,919","00:07:43,468","Duck and cover until
the Secret Ninjas give the all clear."
139,"00:07:43,630","00:07:45,724","- And also, don't forget...
- Yeah?"
140,"00:07:46,299","00:07:47,972","Have a happy birthday, honey."
141,"00:07:48,301","00:07:49,473","Thanks, Mom."
142,"00:07:49,636","00:07:50,637",I'll try my best.
143,"00:07:50,804","00:07:52,272",Of course you will!
144,"00:07:53,807","00:07:55,480",Hello!
145,"00:08:09,864","00:08:11,116",Hey.
146,"00:08:17,664","00:08:19,166",Cool.
147,"00:08:48,653","00:08:52,203","That's the kid I was telling you about.
His dad ruins everything."
148,"00:08:53,700","00:08:55,373","Hello, fellow teenager!"
149,"00:08:55,535","00:08:56,752","Zane, hey!"

151,"00:09:03,668","00:09:06,296","And I'm, like,
""Lay off, Mom. I'm just a teenager."""
152,"00:09:06,463","00:09:07,464",I hear that.
153,"00:09:08,381","00:09:09,382",Bro!
154,"00:09:09,549","00:09:10,721","Dude, gimme a hug, man!"
155,"00:09:10,884","00:09:12,727",Gimme a birthday hug.
156,"00:09:12,886","00:09:14,559","- That's a good one.
- Birthday hug?"
157,"00:09:14,721","00:09:16,064","- Let me get in on that.
- Zane."
158,"00:09:16,222","00:09:17,394",I'll increase the pressure dramatically.
159,"00:09:17,474","00:09:18,726",Zane. Zane. Zane!

163,"00:09:25,815","00:09:28,034","- Hey, actual bro.
- Hey, Nya!"
164,"00:09:28,193","00:09:31,697","Where'd you get that bike?
At the great stuff store? Uh."
165,"00:09:32,322","00:09:34,745","Guys, check out my new paint job,"
166,"00:09:34,908","00:09:36,410",because I did it myself!

to the top of NINJAGO Tower"

212,"00:11:36,112","00:11:40,583","I said I will rule
over NINJAGO...Forever!"

291,"00:15:03,903","00:15:05,496",I'm going after Garmadon.
292,"00:15:07,907","00:15:09,409",Somebody help us!

294,"00:15:16,999","00:15:18,672",Roar!
295,"00:15:22,588","00:15:23,589","Oh, no!"

299,"00:15:36,811","00:15:38,404",You're our hero!
300,"00:15:38,563","00:15:40,236",I wanna be him when I grow up!
301,"00:15:40,440","00:15:42,863","Hey, Lloyd, your dad... I mean..."
302,"00:15:43,025","00:15:44,618",Garmadon's almost at the mayor's office!
303,"00:15:45,069","00:15:46,571",I'm on it.
304,"00:15:47,989","00:15:50,333","We've got you surrounded, Garmadon."
305,"00:15:50,491","00:15:53,119","You're too slow, Green Ninja.
You can't catch me."
306,"00:15:53,286","00:15:55,630",Where am I? Am I over here?
307,"00:15:55,788","00:15:56,880",Or am I over there?
308,"00:15:57,039","00:15:58,882","You are right behind
that building."
309,"00:15:59,125","00:16:00,672",I can see your shark tail sticking out.
310,"00:16:00,835","00:16:02,052","Oh, let me grab that."
311,"00:16:02,962","00:16:04,179",Where's Garmadon now?
312,"00:16:04,505","00:16:07,133","Am I over here, here, here?
Or am I over there, there, there, there?"
313,"00:16:07,300","00:16:08,893",It's like a house of mirrors in here.
314,"00:16:09,051","00:16:10,303","Do you think
you're hiding right now?"
315,"00:16:10,470","00:16:12,347",Do you actually think I can't see you?
316,"00:16:12,513","00:16:14,311","Well, if you can see me,
why don't you shoot me?"
317,"00:16:14,515","00:16:16,438","Ow! That was, like, in my kidney!"
318,"00:16:16,601","00:16:19,400","Why do you want to conquer
NINJAGO so badly?"
319,"00:16:20,021","00:16:23,992","Because there's something
very, very special here."
320,"00:16:24,901","00:16:25,902",What?
321,"00:16:26,068","00:16:28,867","I'm gonna let the walls down
for just a second, Green Ninja."
322,"00:16:29,030","00:16:30,031",Go... Go on.
323,"00:16:30,239","00:16:34,540","About 16 years ago, I lost something
I should have never given up."
324,"00:16:34,744","00:16:37,088","What is it? Just say it.
It's okay, you can say it."
325,"00:16:37,288","00:16:38,961",I had this guitar in college
326,"00:16:39,123","00:16:42,002","and I traded it stupidly for, like,
a jacket or something."
327,"00:16:42,210","00:16:43,553",That's what you were referring to?
328,"00:16:43,711","00:16:44,963",Yeah. What else would I be referring to?
329,"00:16:45,129","00:16:47,052",I don't know. Maybe something else.
330,"00:16:47,215","00:16:48,216","- What? No!
- Think about it."
331,"00:16:48,382","00:16:52,137","Are you sure there's not any other
sort of connection you have to the city?"
332,"00:16:52,303","00:16:53,600","- Nothing?
- There is someone"
333,"00:16:53,763","00:16:55,356",in the city I love very much.
334,"00:16:55,515","00:16:56,562","- Yeah?
- Yeah."
335,"00:16:56,724","00:16:58,317","I remember when I first
laid eyes on him."
336,"00:16:58,476","00:16:59,477",Go on.
337,"00:16:59,852","00:17:02,025",The last time I saw him was...
338,"00:17:02,188","00:17:03,861","I guess about 16 years ago, too."
339,"00:17:04,065","00:17:05,112",Yeah?
340,"00:17:05,274","00:17:08,244",I was just an irresponsible kid and...
341,"00:17:08,402","00:17:09,403",Uh-huh.
342,"00:17:09,570","00:17:10,742",There was this
343,"00:17:11,322","00:17:14,576","guy who made, probably, the best sushi
I've ever had in my life."
344,"00:17:14,742","00:17:16,870","You never knew what was coming next.
And you didn't even order."
345,"00:17:17,036","00:17:18,253","It was one of those places
where you don't even get a menu."
346,"00:17:18,412","00:17:19,834","- Omakase.
- Is that the name of the place?"
347,"00:17:19,997","00:17:22,045","- That just means he brings it to you...
- That is! That's the name of the place."
348,"00:17:22,208","00:17:24,006","- ...and you don't choose, he chooses.
- That's the place."
349,"00:17:24,168","00:17:26,045","Anyway, just to clarify..."
350,"00:17:26,212","00:17:28,385","Nothing, nothing else,
if you really racked your brain,"
351,"00:17:28,631","00:17:29,883",there's no other connection?
352,"00:17:30,258","00:17:32,727",Yes. There was a boy
353,"00:17:33,094","00:17:34,346",that I had in my life.
354,"00:17:34,804","00:17:36,681",What... What happened to your child?
355,"00:17:36,847","00:17:39,066","He was bald, had no teeth,
couldn't chew,"
356,"00:17:39,225","00:17:41,023","always crying, couldn't walk."
357,"00:17:41,185","00:17:43,279","Couldn't even walk. I was like,
""What are we gonna do with this kid?"""
358,"00:17:43,437","00:17:47,192","So I'm like, ""I don't want a hairless,
crying son for the rest of my life."""
359,"00:17:47,358","00:17:48,701","- Shush! Shush! Zip! No!
- And that was when I made the decision"
360,"00:17:48,859","00:17:51,032","- to go away and live my life.
- Stop talking! You're done!"
361,"00:17:51,529","00:17:53,827","Mega missile mode.
Right claw missile."
362,"00:17:53,990","00:17:55,992",Left claw missile. Feet bombs.
363,"00:17:56,158","00:17:58,957","Tongue rocket. Spine missile one, two,
three, four. Tail rocket, one, two..."
364,"00:17:59,120","00:18:00,713",Eye missile. Other eye missile.
365,"00:18:00,871","00:18:01,918",Toenail missile. Wrist rocket.
366,"00:18:02,081","00:18:04,379","Head missile. Other head missile.
Backup head missile."
367,"00:18:04,542","00:18:06,419",Metacarpal missile. Butt torpedoes.
368,"00:18:19,765","00:18:20,812","Oh, phew."
369,"00:18:20,975","00:18:22,522",Just one day till retirement.
370,"00:18:33,904","00:18:37,534","Jeez, where did that come from?
I did not see that coming."
371,"00:18:37,700","00:18:40,169","Your missiles are very accurate,
Green Ninja."
372,"00:18:40,328","00:18:43,707","Too bad for you,
I upgraded all of my shields!"
373,"00:18:43,873","00:18:46,251","That's all I seem to have at the moment,
just some upgraded shields."
374,"00:18:46,417","00:18:47,794","Face it, Garmadon."
375,"00:18:47,960","00:18:50,258","You will never take over NINJAGO,"
376,"00:18:50,421","00:18:53,220","so why don't you just give up
and go away for good?"
377,"00:18:53,382","00:18:57,228","Well, anything's open for discussion.
Oh, yeah, except that."
378,"00:18:57,386","00:18:59,480","Shields down! Here, catch! Shields up!"
379,"00:19:02,683","00:19:03,684",No!
380,"00:19:06,228","00:19:07,605",Did you see that?
381,"00:19:07,772","00:19:08,989","Yeah, we saw it."
382,"00:19:09,148","00:19:10,991","I mean, who taught you how to catch, man?"
383,"00:19:11,776","00:19:13,699","Nice catch, loser!"
384,"00:19:13,861","00:19:15,738","Oh, yeah? Well, take this!"
385,"00:19:19,992","00:19:22,415","That's amazing!
Who taught you how to throw?"
386,"00:19:22,578","00:19:23,955",It's funny you ask.
387,"00:19:24,121","00:19:27,341","No one, because I never had a dad
to play catch with me."
388,"00:19:27,500","00:19:28,501","Well, it shows."
389,"00:19:28,668","00:19:30,636","'Cause that was the worst thing
I've ever seen in my life."
390,"00:19:30,878","00:19:32,880","Or you know,
teach me how to ride a bike"
391,"00:19:33,047","00:19:34,845",or shave...
392,"00:19:35,007","00:19:36,509",...or how to defuse a bomb!
393,"00:19:37,009","00:19:39,979","You know what's funny?
Is I know how to do all those things."
394,"00:19:40,137","00:19:41,138","- Do you?
- Yeah."
395,"00:19:41,263","00:19:42,310","Oh, good to know."
396,"00:19:42,473","00:19:44,692","And they're just sitting there,
idle in my brain."
397,"00:19:44,850","00:19:46,693",Just wasted. Floating away.
398,"00:19:46,852","00:19:48,729","- Never taught them to anybody.
- Mmm-hmm."
399,"00:19:48,979","00:19:51,027","- And they'll probably die with me.
- Really?"
400,"00:19:51,190","00:19:52,942","When I die, if I die."
401,"00:19:53,109","00:19:55,828","- Just leave NINJAGO already...
- Which will never happen."
402,"00:19:55,986","00:19:57,112","- ...please!
- I will never die."
403,"00:19:57,279","00:19:59,247","- And get out of my life!
- Ever. Ever. I..."
404,"00:20:00,658","00:20:02,660",Get out of your life?
405,"00:20:03,119","00:20:04,962","Weirdly kinda personal, isn't it?"
406,"00:20:05,204","00:20:07,252","- Uh-oh.
- Oh, man."
407,"00:20:08,165","00:20:09,337",Um...
408,"00:20:09,959","00:20:10,960",No.
409,"00:20:11,127","00:20:13,095","You've got a lot of issues, Green Ninja."
410,"00:20:13,254","00:20:16,098","I hope you get the chance to work
'em all out by the time I'm back."
411,"00:20:16,257","00:20:17,258","And when I return,"
412,"00:20:17,425","00:20:20,304","I'll have something really wicked
in store for you."
413,"00:20:20,469","00:20:22,062",Something big!
414,"00:20:22,221","00:20:24,315","Uh, did he just say he's coming back?"
415,"00:20:24,473","00:20:26,441","Can't those Ninjas
get rid of him for good?"
416,"00:20:26,600","00:20:29,854","Oh, great. Now I have to rebuild
my Pilates studio."
417,"00:20:30,020","00:20:31,146",That stinks.
418,"00:20:31,313","00:20:32,940","I don't know how,
but I bet Lloyd Garmadon"
419,"00:20:33,107","00:20:34,279",has something to do with this.
420,"00:20:34,442","00:20:36,319","- You can sure say that again.
- I don't know how.."
421,"00:20:37,194","00:20:38,867",Is that Green Ninja still staring at me?
422,"00:20:39,029","00:20:40,246","Yes, sir."
423,"00:20:40,948","00:20:42,700",What a weirdo.
424,"00:20:57,047","00:21:00,347","Volcano base, this is
Alpha Squad. Arriving shortly at LZ."
425,"00:21:00,509","00:21:03,353","Bakery team, the victory cake
goes back in the fridge."
426,"00:21:03,512","00:21:05,890","The victory cake
goes back in the fridge."
427,"00:21:06,056","00:21:08,309","There is a magma spill
on Deck Three."
428,"00:21:08,476","00:21:11,525",Avoid Deck Three if sensitive to magma.
429,"00:21:14,482","00:21:17,952","Just passed Garmadon in
the hallway, he seems pretty angry."
430,"00:21:18,110","00:21:21,831","He's requesting a mandatory
staff meeting by the fireplace."
431,"00:21:22,531","00:21:23,578",Is that the room with the lava
432,"00:21:23,741","00:21:25,038",or the room where people get fired?
433,"00:21:25,201","00:21:26,498",It's both.
434,"00:21:40,800","00:21:42,427","Well, Generals,"
435,"00:21:42,593","00:21:44,561",congratulations.
436,"00:21:44,720","00:21:47,018",We finally conquered NINJAGO.
437,"00:21:48,516","00:21:51,861",I'm not certain we did that.
438,"00:21:52,019","00:21:53,487",I was being sarcastic!
439,"00:21:53,979","00:21:57,108","Every time I try and conquer NINJAGO,"
440,"00:21:57,316","00:22:00,115","that meddling Green Ninja thwarts me.
I mean, who are these super ninjas?"
441,"00:22:00,277","00:22:03,076","Every time I come up with a new plan,
they still beat me!"
442,"00:22:03,239","00:22:04,957",And they don't even have cool suits!
443,"00:22:05,115","00:22:07,914","You guys have
crab outfits and shark outfits."
444,"00:22:08,077","00:22:10,796",Maybe we're spending too much on outfits.
445,"00:22:10,955","00:22:12,923","That sounds right to me, sir."
446,"00:22:13,165","00:22:14,291","Oh, come on!"
447,"00:22:14,500","00:22:16,218","Look, you guys gotta
think for yourselves."
448,"00:22:16,377","00:22:18,379","I'm not your father, all right?"
449,"00:22:18,546","00:22:19,889","Is that a weird thing for him
to say to us?"
450,"00:22:20,005","00:22:21,006",General Number One...
451,"00:22:21,173","00:22:23,267","do you wanna be a follower,
or do you wanna be a leader?"
452,"00:22:24,969","00:22:26,095",A leader...
453,"00:22:26,262","00:22:27,764",How dare you.
454,"00:22:28,514","00:22:29,982","I mean, follower!"
455,"00:22:30,266","00:22:31,358",You! What's your title?
456,"00:22:31,475","00:22:33,022","I'm General Number Two, sir."
457,"00:22:33,185","00:22:34,858","- Well, now, you're General Number One.
- Oh."
458,"00:22:35,062","00:22:36,234","And you, what's your title?"
459,"00:22:36,397","00:22:38,491","- General Three?
- Well, now you're General Number Two."
460,"00:22:38,649","00:22:40,401","- You see where I'm going with this?
- No."
461,"00:22:40,568","00:22:43,162","I told the Green Ninja
I was coming back with something big,"
462,"00:22:43,320","00:22:45,743","something wicked,
something with some pizzazz."
463,"00:22:45,990","00:22:48,038","General Number One,"
464,"00:22:48,200","00:22:49,873",go ahead. Give me some ideas.
465,"00:22:50,035","00:22:53,539","Well, sir, I was thinking maybe we could
work on the morale of the troops."
466,"00:22:53,706","00:22:55,333",They're always scared of being fired!
467,"00:22:56,709","00:23:00,339","We could do the same thing
we did last time?"
468,"00:23:01,463","00:23:02,555",Whoa!
469,"00:23:02,715","00:23:04,467","What if we dress up
as the Secret Ninjas?"
470,"00:23:04,675","00:23:05,972",It's time we develop a code language.
471,"00:23:06,135","00:23:09,230","Intimidation. We paint angry eyebrows
on the troops' faces."
472,"00:23:09,388","00:23:10,560",What if you just ran for mayor?
473,"00:23:13,392","00:23:16,737","Oh, come on. How hard is it
to come up with a genius idea?"
474,"00:23:17,271","00:23:20,320","Anyone? Come on, jump ball.
This is a safe place."
475,"00:23:20,482","00:23:21,859",Go ahead. Just grab it.
476,"00:23:22,026","00:23:24,074","- Excuse me, Lord--
- Nerd! You're interrupting."
477,"00:23:24,653","00:23:27,782","Sorry, sir. We just cooked
this up in engineering."
478,"00:23:27,948","00:23:29,370",Give me that!
479,"00:23:30,409","00:23:32,286",Garma-daddy likey!
480,"00:23:37,291","00:23:38,884","- Lloyd...
- Yeah?"
481,"00:23:39,043","00:23:41,011","That's your dad.
You were open, man."
482,"00:23:41,170","00:23:42,888",It was highly poignant.
483,"00:23:43,756","00:23:45,099","For me, it's easy to fight him"
484,"00:23:45,257","00:23:46,804","'cause he's, like, not my father."
485,"00:23:46,967","00:23:48,810","But for you,
that must be so complicated."
486,"00:23:48,969","00:23:50,016",Not that complicated.
487,"00:23:50,429","00:23:52,648","You also really pulled
at my heartstrings, man."
488,"00:23:53,641","00:23:55,564",I felt for you.
489,"00:23:55,726","00:23:57,069",With the missiles.
490,"00:23:57,227","00:23:58,774",No. With the other stuff.
491,"00:23:59,563","00:24:00,815",The dad stuff.
492,"00:24:00,981","00:24:03,780","Yeah, but, like, exactly
what are you referring to?"
493,"00:24:03,943","00:24:06,071","- Watching you and your father.
- The vulnerability."
494,"00:24:06,236","00:24:07,237",You got so emotional.
495,"00:24:07,404","00:24:09,998",Emotions were the last thing
496,"00:24:10,157","00:24:12,000",that was going on out there.
497,"00:24:12,826","00:24:14,578","- Uh, yeah.
- Mmm-hmm."
498,"00:24:14,954","00:24:17,958","It's okay, Lloyd.
Nobody's parents are perfect."
499,"00:24:18,123","00:24:20,922","I mean, my mom is weird
and collects seashells."
500,"00:24:21,085","00:24:24,339","Your dad levels cities
and attacks innocent people."
501,"00:24:24,505","00:24:27,008","So, they've all got
their quirks, you know?"
502,"00:24:28,342","00:24:30,811","Uh, wh... Where's that
tranquil music coming from?"
503,"00:24:30,970","00:24:33,974","Hey, look, everyone!
Master Wu is back."
504,"00:24:34,139","00:24:36,187","- Hello, students.
- Master Wu!"
505,"00:24:36,350","00:24:38,102","- Shock.
- How was your trip?"
506,"00:24:38,268","00:24:40,441",It was a deep spiritual journey
507,"00:24:40,604","00:24:44,234","that took me to depths inside myself
I never knew existed."
508,"00:24:44,400","00:24:46,619","Yeah. You have
a pretty serious tan line."
509,"00:24:46,777","00:24:50,327","- Don't judge me.
- Did you see us kick Garmadon's butt?"
510,"00:24:50,489","00:24:51,957","- We vanquished him.
- Ba-ba-bam!"
511,"00:24:52,116","00:24:55,336","I saw you fight
and I saw Garmadon retreat."
512,"00:24:55,494","00:24:58,589","- But you did not defeat him.
- What?"
513,"00:24:59,248","00:25:02,001",There's nothing ninja about you ninjas.
514,"00:25:02,167","00:25:03,669","We're so ninja. I don't know
what you're talking about."
515,"00:25:03,836","00:25:06,385",You will never truly defeat Garmadon
516,"00:25:06,547","00:25:10,142","until you see things
from a different point of view."
517,"00:25:10,592","00:25:13,687","You have the power to win
the battle without fighting."
518,"00:25:13,846","00:25:18,226","When you start using your mind,
you won't need mechs and machines."
519,"00:25:18,392","00:25:20,986",Your call signs are not just cool names.
520,"00:25:21,145","00:25:24,399","They are the elemental powers
you were all born with."
521,"00:25:24,857","00:25:28,862","Nya, you can create water on your own."
522,"00:25:29,570","00:25:31,447","- And Kai, fire!
- Wow."
523,"00:25:32,156","00:25:34,955","- Jay, lightning.
- So ninja."
524,"00:25:35,117","00:25:36,539","- Cole, earth.
- Whoa!"
525,"00:25:37,327","00:25:38,453",We both spin.
526,"00:25:38,620","00:25:40,042","And Zane, ice."
527,"00:25:40,205","00:25:41,457",Ice is nice.
528,"00:25:41,623","00:25:44,627","These elemental powers
are why I chose you"
529,"00:25:44,793","00:25:46,670",to form the Secret Ninja Force.
530,"00:25:46,837","00:25:50,137","It is the highest level
that you can achieve as a ninja."
531,"00:25:50,299","00:25:54,099","I wrote a book about it.
It's called Ninjanuity."
532,"00:25:54,344","00:25:55,641","Copyright, Master Wu."
533,"00:25:55,804","00:25:58,557","And, uh, and what about me?
What, what am I?"
534,"00:25:58,724","00:26:02,069","Lloyd, yours is the most
important element of all."
535,"00:26:02,227","00:26:03,695",Okay. Hit me with it.
536,"00:26:03,854","00:26:07,529",Your elemental power is green.
537,"00:26:07,691","00:26:09,443","- What's that?
- Green."
538,"00:26:09,610","00:26:11,988","Okay, so just to recap."
539,"00:26:12,154","00:26:14,782",Fire. Ice. Water. Earth.
540,"00:26:14,948","00:26:16,575",Lightning. And...
541,"00:26:16,742","00:26:19,165","- Green.
- Don't think it's an element though."
542,"00:26:19,328","00:26:20,545","- Lloyd...
- Can I be gold?"
543,"00:26:20,704","00:26:22,581","- No.
- Wind isn't taken. Can I be wind?"
544,"00:26:22,748","00:26:24,466","- No.
- Earth, green, and fire."
545,"00:26:24,625","00:26:25,797","- Rolls right off the tongue.
- Lloyd..."
546,"00:26:26,001","00:26:29,221",Could I be the element of surprise?
547,"00:26:29,379","00:26:31,256",No. That's the Fuchsia Ninja.
548,"00:26:31,423","00:26:32,800",Surprise.
549,"00:26:32,966","00:26:34,764",There are so many elements left.
550,"00:26:34,927","00:26:37,771","This feels kinda purposeful
that I don't have one."
551,"00:26:37,930","00:26:40,524","Enough, Lloyd.
Come with me for mentor talk."
552,"00:26:40,682","00:26:43,231","The rest of you, practice Spinjitzu."
553,"00:26:43,393","00:26:45,441",That's easy. Watch this.
554,"00:26:45,604","00:26:46,605",Exertion.
555,"00:26:46,772","00:26:48,445",For three hours.
556,"00:26:48,607","00:26:50,985","Three hours!
Are you kidding me with this guy!"
557,"00:26:51,151","00:26:52,323",And read my book!
558,"00:26:52,486","00:26:54,204","- Oh, man!
- Ugh."
559,"00:26:58,617","00:27:00,961","Master Wu, you don't understand."
560,"00:27:01,453","00:27:03,455","Right now, on that volcano,"
561,"00:27:04,873","00:27:07,672",Garmadon is making something really big.
562,"00:27:07,835","00:27:09,712",He's building something huge.
563,"00:27:09,878","00:27:12,973",And something surely shark themed.
564,"00:27:16,093","00:27:18,721","And he's gonna come back
sooner rather than later."
565,"00:27:19,471","00:27:21,269","So, what do I do?"
566,"00:27:21,431","00:27:25,311","Nephew, weapons alone will not
solve your problem."
567,"00:27:25,477","00:27:27,946",I have every kind of weapon in my dojo.
568,"00:27:28,105","00:27:31,200","Big weapons, little weapons,
sharp weapons, dull weapons,"
569,"00:27:31,358","00:27:32,780",even the Ultimate Weapon.
570,"00:27:32,943","00:27:35,446",But the strongest weapon is inside you.
571,"00:27:35,612","00:27:37,706","Wait. I'm sorry, what did you just say?"
572,"00:27:37,865","00:27:39,287",The strongest weapon is inside you.
573,"00:27:39,449","00:27:41,451","No, no, no. Before that.
The thing right before that."
574,"00:27:41,618","00:27:42,995",What? You mean...
575,"00:27:43,495","00:27:44,792",The Ultimate Weapon!
576,"00:27:51,587","00:27:53,464",And you've been hiding this why?
577,"00:27:53,630","00:27:55,052","In the wrong hands,"
578,"00:27:55,215","00:27:58,389","the Ultimate Weapon
could spell doom for NINJAGO."
579,"00:27:58,552","00:28:00,680",Put that in my hands.
580,"00:28:00,846","00:28:04,191","Why does it matter how we beat
Garmadon as long as we beat him?"
581,"00:28:04,349","00:28:06,522","Because, nephew, right now,"
582,"00:28:06,685","00:28:09,905",your hands are the wrong hands.
583,"00:28:16,737","00:28:17,989","Lloyd,"
584,"00:28:18,155","00:28:19,577",I'm his brother.
585,"00:28:19,740","00:28:23,586","I, too, feel responsible
for the safety of NINJAGO."
586,"00:28:23,744","00:28:25,917","But I will not always
be here to train you."
587,"00:28:26,079","00:28:27,752","- Why?
- Because..."
588,"00:28:28,165","00:28:32,921","- I'm super, super old.
- Oh."
589,"00:28:33,128","00:28:36,678","That's why I need you
to lead the Secret Ninja Force."
590,"00:28:37,549","00:28:40,974","But you must promise
to walk a different path."
591,"00:28:41,136","00:28:44,982","One that only
the son of Garmadon can walk."
592,"00:28:45,515","00:28:47,893",No matter how hard it may be.
593,"00:28:50,103","00:28:54,734","Honestly, I would happily
give up being a Secret Ninja"
594,"00:28:55,400","00:28:59,200","if it meant I didn't have
to be the son of Garmadon."
595,"00:28:59,363","00:29:03,459","I know you've had a hard life,
Lloyd, filled with many knocks."
596,"00:29:03,617","00:29:05,244",Why don't I play you a song?
597,"00:29:05,410","00:29:07,208",Perhaps it will speak to you.
598,"00:29:20,425","00:29:21,426","Thanks, Uncle Wu."
599,"00:29:41,363","00:29:43,457","No, no. I don't know where he is."
600,"00:29:43,615","00:29:45,538","No, he hasn't come home from school."
601,"00:29:47,995","00:29:50,339","No, he did not join
forces with his father."
602,"00:29:50,497","00:29:52,841","That is ridiculous.
Like your husband's a saint."
603,"00:29:58,171","00:30:01,300","I am trying not to freak out right now,
but I have called 18 people"
604,"00:30:01,466","00:30:03,264",and I cannot locate my son.
605,"00:30:03,427","00:30:06,180","Yes, I know you said you never
wanted him to play with your kids..."
606,"00:30:06,346","00:30:07,723","I just didn't know if, maybe..."
607,"00:30:08,557","00:30:09,683","- Lloyd!
- Hey, Mom."
608,"00:30:09,850","00:30:11,352","No. I've got him right here.
He just walked in. Bye-bye."
609,"00:30:12,019","00:30:13,692","Oh, my gosh. I was so worried about you."
610,"00:30:13,854","00:30:16,448",I'm fine. I just took the long way home.
611,"00:30:16,606","00:30:18,734","Why did we get on a family plan
if you're not gonna text me?"
612,"00:30:18,900","00:30:20,322","I'm so sorry.
I didn't mean to worry you."
613,"00:30:20,485","00:30:22,158",I love you and I'm sorry.
614,"00:30:24,323","00:30:27,122","I don't know what I'd do
if anything ever happened to you, okay?"
615,"00:30:27,284","00:30:28,376","Thanks, Mom."
616,"00:30:28,535","00:30:31,163","I'm just really glad
that those ninjas saved the day."
617,"00:30:31,330","00:30:33,628","Yeah. Yeah, I was... I was there."
618,"00:30:33,790","00:30:34,791",What?
619,"00:30:34,958","00:30:38,963",Watching with the other regular kids.
620,"00:30:39,129","00:30:41,598","Okay. Well, you must be starving."
621,"00:30:41,757","00:30:43,304","I don't know.
I'm not really that hungry."
622,"00:30:43,467","00:30:46,016",But I'll make your favorite. Dumplings!
623,"00:30:46,386","00:30:50,937","Oh, enticing, but I'm just
gonna go to bed, I think."
624,"00:30:51,099","00:30:53,773",Just really tired.
625,"00:30:53,977","00:30:55,854","- Oh.
- Good night, Mom."
626,"00:30:58,440","00:31:00,033","Okay, well, good night."
627,"00:31:08,116","00:31:09,743","And back at number one with a bullet,"
628,"00:31:09,910","00:31:13,039","no surprises there,
is Boo, Lloyd, the remix."
629,"00:31:13,955","00:31:17,175","L-L...
L-L-O-Y-D..."
630,"00:31:18,794","00:31:21,764","L-L-O-Y-D.
His dad is bad and so is he."
631,"00:31:21,922","00:31:24,016","Boo, Lloyd! Boo, Lloyd!"
632,"00:31:24,758","00:31:26,635","- Huh?
- What is that?"
633,"00:31:34,810","00:31:36,858","Hey, Green Ninja, I'm back!"
634,"00:31:37,771","00:31:39,273",And look what I brought with me.
635,"00:31:43,777","00:31:44,778",Breaking news.
636,"00:31:45,028","00:31:47,781","Garmadon is attacking the city
in a never-before-seen mech."
637,"00:31:47,948","00:31:49,245",Run! Run!
638,"00:31:49,408","00:31:51,502","- Garmadon!
- Garmadon!"
639,"00:31:51,660","00:31:53,162","Ah, you all came out to greet me?"
640,"00:31:53,328","00:31:54,671",Don't run away.
641,"00:31:54,830","00:31:58,585","That's a nice little hot dog stand
you got there. Scu-smash!"
642,"00:31:58,750","00:32:01,845","The Ninjas are going to have
their hands full with this thing."
643,"00:32:02,379","00:32:03,756","Ninja, go!"
644,"00:32:08,468","00:32:11,347","We got a message from your brother
Garmadon. You wanna hear it?"
645,"00:32:11,513","00:32:13,982","Oh, yeah? What did he say?"
646,"00:32:14,182","00:32:16,685","He says you're a big stupid
dumb-dumb with a dumb face"
647,"00:32:16,852","00:32:19,355","and a big butt and your butt stinks
and you smell like a butt."
648,"00:32:20,063","00:32:21,610",That sounds like my brother.
649,"00:32:21,773","00:32:23,150",Get him!
650,"00:32:29,489","00:32:30,706","- Jay.
- Yeah?"
651,"00:32:30,866","00:32:31,867",You take the air.
652,"00:32:32,033","00:32:34,001","Kai, Zane and Cole, downtown."
653,"00:32:34,828","00:32:36,501","- Nya, water.
- You got it."
654,"00:32:36,663","00:32:38,165",I'm going after Garmadon.
655,"00:32:38,331","00:32:39,924",Why don't I take your dad this time?
656,"00:32:40,584","00:32:42,678",I got this. I'm totes profesh.
657,"00:32:42,836","00:32:43,837",Wait. What does that mean?
658,"00:32:44,004","00:32:46,257","I think he's trying to say
he's a total professional."
659,"00:32:46,423","00:32:47,925",Then why is he totes abbrevin'?
660,"00:32:48,091","00:32:49,764",I'm pretty sure Lloyd's nervous.
661,"00:32:49,926","00:32:52,645",What? That's crazy talk.
662,"00:32:52,804","00:32:53,896",Incorrect.
663,"00:32:54,055","00:32:55,432","Hey, I got this!"
664,"00:32:55,599","00:32:57,021","Stand down, Garmadon."
665,"00:32:57,184","00:32:59,152","Well, hello, Green Ninja!"
666,"00:32:59,311","00:33:02,690","It's time for you
to ninja go away for good."
667,"00:33:02,856","00:33:04,529","- Take this!
- Mega missile mode."
668,"00:33:04,691","00:33:06,819","Left claw missile. Toenail missile.
Wrist rocket."
669,"00:33:06,985","00:33:08,862","Feet bombs.
Spine missile one, two, three, four."
670,"00:33:09,029","00:33:11,748","Tail rocket one, two.
Eye missile. Other eye missile."
671,"00:33:11,907","00:33:14,035","Tongue rocket. Head missile.
Other head missile."
672,"00:33:14,201","00:33:15,748",Backup head missile. Butt torpedoes.
673,"00:33:19,498","00:33:22,672","Your weapons are powerless
against my new mech."
674,"00:33:23,460","00:33:24,461",What?
675,"00:33:27,714","00:33:28,761","Well, take this!"
676,"00:33:29,257","00:33:30,884",Releasing full payload.
677,"00:33:31,051","00:33:32,348",Here it...
678,"00:33:32,511","00:33:33,763",Alert! Alert! Alert!
679,"00:33:33,929","00:33:36,227","You having trouble
with that dragon mech, Green Ninja?"
680,"00:33:37,766","00:33:38,767",Bye-bye.
681,"00:33:38,934","00:33:40,277",Wait. NO!
682,"00:33:43,563","00:33:44,689","Jay, what's happening?"
683,"00:33:44,856","00:33:46,824",Garmadon has taken out Lloyd.
684,"00:33:46,983","00:33:48,075","- What?
- Wait, what?"
685,"00:33:48,235","00:33:49,782",I'm sorry. What did you say?
686,"00:33:49,945","00:33:52,494","Repeat.
Garmadon has taken out Lloyd!"
687,"00:34:00,497","00:34:02,841","Looks like the police, the army
and the coast guard have"
688,"00:34:03,041","00:34:05,840","all been rendered useless
by Garmadon's forces."
689,"00:34:08,463","00:34:10,932","Guys, Garmadon's almost at city hall."
690,"00:34:11,091","00:34:12,809",Can one of you please stop him?
691,"00:34:13,468","00:34:14,890",I'm swamped down here.
692,"00:34:15,053","00:34:16,646",I'm a little busy.
693,"00:34:18,181","00:34:19,273",Look at me go!
694,"00:34:20,934","00:34:23,687","Who wants a shark?
You want a shark?"
695,"00:34:23,853","00:34:24,979",You get a shark!
696,"00:34:25,146","00:34:26,272",We're shark bait!
697,"00:34:26,439","00:34:27,986","Come on, come on, come on."
698,"00:34:37,117","00:34:40,087",Just walking up the tower.
699,"00:34:43,123","00:34:45,717","Um, Lloyd would be
really beneficial right now."
700,"00:34:46,960","00:34:48,633","Where are you, Lloyd?"
701,"00:34:48,795","00:34:50,342",I'm a ninja master!
702,"00:34:53,633","00:34:55,226",You are no match for me!
703,"00:34:56,177","00:34:58,851","I came here to drink
boba and kick butt"
704,"00:34:59,014","00:35:01,062",and I am all out of boba.
705,"00:35:07,314","00:35:09,157","Hey, NINJAGO!"
706,"00:35:09,316","00:35:10,818","Oh, wait. That's bad."
707,"00:35:11,359","00:35:15,114",Garmadon is conquering NINJAGO!
708,"00:35:17,240","00:35:20,710","Robin, this is a day
that will live in infamy."
709,"00:35:20,869","00:35:22,246","- I just made that up.
- No, you didn't."
710,"00:35:22,412","00:35:24,756","Yes, I did. Copyright, Michael Strahan.
It's mine now."
711,"00:35:25,040","00:35:27,088",Whoo! I've done it!
712,"00:35:27,250","00:35:30,379",I'm finally the ruler of NINJAGO!
713,"00:35:30,545","00:35:33,139",Forever! And ever!
714,"00:35:35,884","00:35:37,807","Stand down, Garmadon!"
715,"00:35:40,805","00:35:42,102",Green Ninja?
716,"00:35:43,808","00:35:46,561",And the legendary Ultimate Weapon?
717,"00:35:46,728","00:35:48,196",It's not fair.
718,"00:35:50,982","00:35:54,577","I'm sick and tired of you
trying to conquer NINJAGO!"
719,"00:35:54,736","00:35:57,785","All right, Green Ninja.
Now, listen. Just calm down."
720,"00:35:57,947","00:35:59,540",You don't have to use that thing.
721,"00:35:59,699","00:36:00,996",So you're gonna leave NINJAGO?
722,"00:36:01,159","00:36:02,206","- Yeah.
- Forever?"
723,"00:36:02,369","00:36:03,712",I promise.
724,"00:36:04,537","00:36:06,289","What do you...
Why is your hand behind your back?"
725,"00:36:06,456","00:36:08,254","What are you doing back there?
Are you crossing your fingers?"
726,"00:36:08,416","00:36:10,089",That's physically impossible.
727,"00:36:10,251","00:36:12,128","How could I be crossing my fingers?
I have these things."
728,"00:36:12,295","00:36:13,342","I'm warning you, Garmadon!"
729,"00:36:13,505","00:36:15,724",Fine! No crossies! No crossies!
730,"00:36:15,882","00:36:17,759",Just chill. Okay. Look...
731,"00:36:17,926","00:36:21,226","I'm getting rid of all my sharks.
See? No sharks."
732,"00:36:21,388","00:36:23,140",And the sharks in your ankle holster.
733,"00:36:23,306","00:36:24,478",I don't have any sharks.
734,"00:36:24,641","00:36:26,894","- What's in your ankle?
- It's a couple dolphins, man."
735,"00:36:27,060","00:36:28,903","Now you're acting loco.
I mean, this is..."
736,"00:36:29,062","00:36:30,188",Hey! Get rid of 'em.
737,"00:36:30,355","00:36:32,608",Fine. You happy now?
738,"00:36:32,774","00:36:35,027",I'm done. You win.
739,"00:36:35,193","00:36:36,570","What are you doing?
What are you doing right now?"
740,"00:36:36,736","00:36:38,238","Easy, Green Ninja."
741,"00:36:38,405","00:36:39,577",Don't come any closer!
742,"00:36:39,739","00:36:41,207",Easy.
743,"00:36:41,366","00:36:43,039","I'm warning you, Garmadon."
744,"00:36:43,201","00:36:46,205","Let's just keep
this interaction very chill."
745,"00:36:46,371","00:36:49,045",I'm the definition of chill right now!
746,"00:36:49,207","00:36:50,424",I know.
747,"00:36:55,213","00:36:56,385",Stand back!
748,"00:36:56,548","00:36:58,642","Put down the Ultimate Weapon,
Green Ninja."
749,"00:36:58,800","00:37:00,598",We both know you're not gonna fire it.
750,"00:37:00,760","00:37:02,933","Oh, yeah? This is your last chance."
751,"00:37:03,096","00:37:07,101","Get out of NINJAGO, now and forever!"
752,"00:37:07,267","00:37:10,146","- No.
- All right, fine. You ready for this?"
753,"00:37:10,311","00:37:11,608","- Yeah.
- It's coming."
754,"00:37:11,771","00:37:13,148","- Okay.
- You've been warned."
755,"00:37:13,314","00:37:14,611","- I'm waiting.
- Here it comes."
756,"00:37:14,774","00:37:16,196","- Any time.
- All right,"
757,"00:37:16,359","00:37:17,952",here it comes!
758,"00:37:18,528","00:37:19,700","Oh, my gosh!"
759,"00:37:19,863","00:37:22,867","He actually shot and it exploded...
And then..."
760,"00:37:23,032","00:37:26,502","But nothing is happening.
Why is nothing happening?"
761,"00:37:26,661","00:37:27,662",What the heck?
762,"00:37:27,829","00:37:29,456",It's like the Ultimate Lamest Weapon.
763,"00:37:29,622","00:37:31,044",Come on!
764,"00:37:31,207","00:37:32,834",Why won't you work?
765,"00:37:33,793","00:37:34,794",Get off my Vespa!
766,"00:37:37,756","00:37:38,928",Whoa. Ow.
767,"00:37:39,758","00:37:41,055",You hear that?
768,"00:37:43,636","00:37:45,058",What have you done?
769,"00:37:57,108","00:37:59,202",Aw!
770,"00:38:02,822","00:38:04,699",How do I turn this thing off?
771,"00:38:08,620","00:38:09,621",Come on!
772,"00:38:13,124","00:38:14,751","Generals, grab the Green Ninja."
773,"00:38:15,168","00:38:16,294",Keep away.
774,"00:38:21,633","00:38:22,634","Wait! No, no, no!"
775,"00:38:22,801","00:38:23,848","Remember, Green Ninja,"
776,"00:38:24,010","00:38:26,388","I didn't fire this thing first.
That's on you."
777,"00:38:26,888","00:38:28,936","But, since you got it all warmed up..."
778,"00:38:29,098","00:38:31,567",let's try it on some moving targets.
779,"00:38:33,937","00:38:34,938",No!
780,"00:38:38,858","00:38:41,031",What the heck!
781,"00:38:45,740","00:38:48,163","Stop it, Garmadon! Just stop it!"
782,"00:38:51,371","00:38:54,295",What is this thing?
783,"00:39:04,843","00:39:06,561",I'm gonna throw up!
784,"00:39:11,015","00:39:13,609",Prolonged scream.
785,"00:39:21,484","00:39:22,656","Five ninjas down,"
786,"00:39:22,819","00:39:24,321",one to go.
787,"00:39:39,544","00:39:41,717",Bang! I win! Cue the music!
788,"00:39:42,005","00:39:43,882",Whoo!
789,"00:39:47,427","00:39:48,474","Awesome job, sir!"
790,"00:39:48,636","00:39:50,684",What? Are you gonna cry?
791,"00:39:50,847","00:39:52,099",I'm not gonna cry.
792,"00:39:52,265","00:39:53,482",I bet he's gonna cry.
793,"00:39:55,560","00:39:57,437",I'm not gonna cry...
794,"00:39:58,104","00:39:59,105",Dad.
795,"00:40:06,321","00:40:07,322",La-Loyd?
796,"00:40:07,488","00:40:10,492",That's right! It's me! Your son!
797,"00:40:10,658","00:40:12,535","And it's Lloyd, Dad."
798,"00:40:12,702","00:40:16,627",No. L-L-O-Y-D. I named you.
799,"00:40:16,789","00:40:17,881",You ruined my life!
800,"00:40:18,082","00:40:20,460","How could I ruin your life?
I wasn't even there."
801,"00:40:34,307","00:40:36,309",I wish you weren't my father.
802,"00:40:53,743","00:40:56,087","And we're back in
three, two, one..."
803,"00:40:56,245","00:40:58,714","Welcome back, NINJAGO.
I'm Robin Roberts."
804,"00:40:58,873","00:41:02,468","And as you can see, our city is in
the midst of total annihilation."
805,"00:41:02,627","00:41:05,676","And for a city that gets
attacked pretty frequently, Robin..."
806,"00:41:07,131","00:41:08,348",...that's really saying something.
807,"00:41:08,508","00:41:12,103","As we struggle to survive,
we're left with so many questions like,"
808,"00:41:12,261","00:41:14,229","""Who has truly conquered NINJAGO?"""
809,"00:41:15,139","00:41:16,516",The monster?
810,"00:41:18,101","00:41:19,478",Or Garmadon?
811,"00:41:21,062","00:41:22,063",We did it!
812,"00:41:22,230","00:41:23,322",Party time!
813,"00:41:25,274","00:41:26,275",Incoming!
814,"00:41:26,442","00:41:27,489",We did it!
815,"00:41:27,652","00:41:28,699",Let's go.
816,"00:41:31,781","00:41:34,000","""I wish you weren't my father."""
817,"00:41:34,158","00:41:35,205",Huh?
818,"00:41:35,368","00:41:38,121","Is it just me, or was that
kind of a weird thing to say?"
819,"00:41:38,287","00:41:40,005","""I wish you weren't my father."""
820,"00:41:40,164","00:41:42,633","And the tone,
it was so disrespectful."
821,"00:41:42,792","00:41:44,510","Yes, sir. Plus, he tried to shoot you."
822,"00:41:44,669","00:41:47,263","Yeah! Right before you
totally conquered his city!"
823,"00:41:47,422","00:41:50,972","We conquered your greatest
foe, turned out to be your son though..."
824,"00:41:51,134","00:41:52,727","I'm sure he meant it as a compliment,"
825,"00:41:52,885","00:41:55,889","but it's a weird thing, right?
General Number One!"
826,"00:41:56,055","00:41:57,147",Sir!
827,"00:41:57,306","00:41:58,398",Have you captured my son yet?
828,"00:41:58,891","00:42:00,939","No, not yet, sir."
829,"00:42:01,102","00:42:02,524","And yet, here you are."
830,"00:42:02,687","00:42:06,157","Partying on the rooftops
with a paper umbrella in your drink."
831,"00:42:07,859","00:42:10,533","What about La-Loyd's ninja friends?
You captured any of them yet?"
832,"00:42:10,695","00:42:12,072","No, sir."
833,"00:42:12,238","00:42:13,865","And what about my brother, Wu?"
834,"00:42:14,032","00:42:15,579","No, sir."
835,"00:42:16,075","00:42:17,952","What about my ex, Koko? You found her?"
836,"00:42:18,119","00:42:20,417","Mmm. No, sir."
837,"00:42:20,580","00:42:22,582","Well, you certainly had no trouble
finding the bar, did you?"
838,"00:42:22,749","00:42:25,593","We're on it, sir. We searched
the whole city from top to bottom."
839,"00:42:25,752","00:42:27,720","Look, you're not on the list.
Oh, my clipboard!"
840,"00:42:28,171","00:42:29,889","Look, here she is now."
841,"00:42:37,305","00:42:39,728","Hey, Koko.
Glad you made it to the party."
842,"00:42:39,891","00:42:41,234","Pretty on the chain, isn't it?"
843,"00:42:41,392","00:42:43,520","Wipe that smile off your face, Garmadon."
844,"00:42:43,686","00:42:45,188","Ugh, same old Kokes."
845,"00:42:45,354","00:42:48,073","It just kills you to see me
having any fun, doesn't it?"
846,"00:42:48,232","00:42:51,076","Oh, by the way, quick question.
What was it again?"
847,"00:42:51,235","00:42:53,533","Oh, yeah. Why did you
turn our son against me?"
848,"00:42:53,696","00:42:58,042","Me? You turned him against you, Garm.
You're a maniacal twisted villain."
849,"00:42:58,201","00:43:00,124","All right, look,
enough with the compliments."
850,"00:43:00,286","00:43:02,129","Whose idea was it for him
to become a ninja?"
851,"00:43:02,288","00:43:03,665",Lloyd is not a ninja.
852,"00:43:04,123","00:43:05,966",Ha! Who's the absentee parent now?
853,"00:43:06,125","00:43:07,342",What are you talking about?
854,"00:43:07,502","00:43:09,971",La-Loyd. He's the Green Ninja.
855,"00:43:10,755","00:43:14,180","One of my greatest enemies,
honor-bound and sworn to destroy me."
856,"00:43:14,342","00:43:17,186","You know what he said to me?
He said that he wished--"
857,"00:43:17,345","00:43:18,847",What have you done with him?
858,"00:43:22,600","00:43:24,102",Where's Lloyd?
859,"00:43:25,812","00:43:27,814","My gosh, woman, what happened to us?"
860,"00:43:28,314","00:43:30,237","- I miss that fire.
- Ugh."
861,"00:43:31,442","00:43:34,491","You know, I've always tried
to get Lloyd to see"
862,"00:43:34,654","00:43:37,123","that he shouldn't be ashamed
of who his father is."
863,"00:43:37,657","00:43:39,000","But now,"
864,"00:43:40,701","00:43:43,420",I'm starting to think he could be right.
865,"00:44:30,543","00:44:32,887","Oh, no. No, no. Please. Please, no."
866,"00:44:35,423","00:44:36,800",Uncle Wu...
867,"00:44:40,720","00:44:42,313","Oh, my gosh! You guys are okay!"
868,"00:44:42,471","00:44:45,020","- Barely.
- You used the Ultimate Weapon."
869,"00:44:45,183","00:44:46,526","- Not cool.
- Dude, our mechs are totaled."
870,"00:44:46,684","00:44:48,937","And now,
that cat's destroying NINJAGO."
871,"00:44:49,103","00:44:51,151","We were the only people
that didn't hate you,"
872,"00:44:51,314","00:44:52,657",and now we hate you!
873,"00:44:52,815","00:44:56,445","Deleting all data related to
treating Lloyd as a friend."
874,"00:44:58,237","00:45:00,035","Guys, I'm sorry."
875,"00:45:00,198","00:45:04,294","I put everyone in danger
and now Master Wu is dead."
876,"00:45:04,827","00:45:06,670","Hello, students."
877,"00:45:06,746","00:45:08,043",Master Wu!
878,"00:45:08,206","00:45:09,799",You're alive!
879,"00:45:09,999","00:45:12,127",Duh! I'm a ninja master.
880,"00:45:12,293","00:45:15,467","If I was gonna die, it would be
to teach you a lesson."
881,"00:45:17,965","00:45:19,592","Lloyd, you have awakened Meowthra."
882,"00:45:19,800","00:45:22,223","- Meowthra?
- Yes, Meowthra."
883,"00:45:22,762","00:45:27,063","The six-toed fluffy demon,
with her sandpaper tongue."
884,"00:45:27,642","00:45:30,737","Her reign of terror
will stretch on and on"
885,"00:45:30,895","00:45:35,571","until all of NINJAGO
is her own personal litter box."
886,"00:45:37,526","00:45:38,994",There's only one hope.
887,"00:45:39,153","00:45:43,408","- One thing that can drive Meowthra away.
- What is it?"
888,"00:45:44,492","00:45:46,415",The Ultimate Ultimate Weapon.
889,"00:45:51,582","00:45:52,879",Whoa!
890,"00:45:53,042","00:45:54,214",Where is this thing?
891,"00:45:54,377","00:45:56,471","On the other side of the island,"
892,"00:45:56,629","00:45:59,849","hidden where only
a true ninja master can find it."
893,"00:46:00,007","00:46:02,180",You must follow the right path.
894,"00:46:02,343","00:46:04,266",Otherwise you will end up
895,"00:46:04,428","00:46:08,649","trapped in the deadly
Jungle of Lost Souls,"
896,"00:46:08,808","00:46:12,028","unable to cross
the Bridge of Fallen Mentors"
897,"00:46:12,186","00:46:16,441","and mired in
the Canyon of General Unhappiness."
898,"00:46:16,607","00:46:18,075","And if you're still alive,"
899,"00:46:18,234","00:46:21,659","you'll be crushed by
the Temple of Fragile Foundations."
900,"00:46:21,821","00:46:25,701","It's a journey many have tried
and none have returned."
901,"00:46:25,866","00:46:28,244",That does sound difficult.
902,"00:46:28,411","00:46:29,537",And terrifying.
903,"00:46:29,704","00:46:30,921",But you know what? We're ready.
904,"00:46:31,080","00:46:32,423","No, you're not."
905,"00:46:32,581","00:46:35,755","It will take great patience,
courage, and hard work."
906,"00:46:35,918","00:46:38,387",All the skills of a true ninja master.
907,"00:46:39,005","00:46:43,476","So, I will make this journey
on my own. Bye."
908,"00:46:43,634","00:46:44,726","- Wait, wait, wait!
- Master Wu, wait!"
909,"00:46:44,885","00:46:47,513","Hold on a second, please."
910,"00:46:47,680","00:46:49,523","Master Wu, I know I let NINJAGO down."
911,"00:46:49,682","00:46:52,276","It's true, Lloyd let NINJAGO down.
Sorry, dude!"
912,"00:46:52,435","00:46:53,812",We want to fix his terrible mistake.
913,"00:46:53,978","00:46:55,571","- Train us to be true ninjas.
- We have the potential."
914,"00:46:55,730","00:46:57,027","- Come on!
- Wait! We'll do anything."
915,"00:46:57,189","00:46:58,532","Please, Master Wu,"
916,"00:46:58,691","00:47:00,284",you can't do this alone.
917,"00:47:00,443","00:47:04,038","I know we're not ninja masters yet,
but you said it yourself."
918,"00:47:04,196","00:47:06,745","It's important
to look at things differently."
919,"00:47:07,908","00:47:11,788","Is there anything I can do
to change your point of view?"
920,"00:47:12,747","00:47:13,794",Hmm.
921,"00:47:14,081","00:47:17,631","Students, are you willing
to give Lloyd a second chance?"
922,"00:47:20,671","00:47:21,672","- Too soon.
- No."
923,"00:47:21,839","00:47:23,307","- Uh, pass.
- Just processing, so..."
924,"00:47:23,466","00:47:25,184",Mmm-mm. Mmm-mmm.
925,"00:47:26,093","00:47:29,347","Lloyd, you have a long way to go
to regain your friends' trust."
926,"00:47:30,348","00:47:33,852","Luckily, there's a long journey
ahead of us."
927,"00:47:34,518","00:47:36,987","Thank you, Master Wu. Thank you."
928,"00:47:37,146","00:47:41,322","The fate of NINJAGO is in your hands.
Are you ready?"
929,"00:47:41,484","00:47:42,861","- Yes, I am on it!
- Yeah!"
930,"00:47:43,027","00:47:44,028","- Yep!
- Maybe."
931,"00:47:44,195","00:47:45,196",Let's go!
932,"00:47:53,454","00:47:55,798","Sir, I think we found them."
933,"00:47:57,166","00:47:58,759","There's a group of
brightly colored ninjas"
934,"00:47:58,918","00:48:01,512","heading towards
the obviously dangerous jungle."
935,"00:48:02,671","00:48:04,093",Hmm. Zoom in a little closer.
936,"00:48:04,673","00:48:06,926",Closer. Clos... Clo...
937,"00:48:07,343","00:48:09,971","No, closer. Closer."
938,"00:48:10,137","00:48:13,482","Yes! Right in on
my stupid brother's dirty beard."
939,"00:48:13,641","00:48:15,939","What's he saying?
Something about a weapon."
940,"00:48:16,102","00:48:18,321",The Omelet Omelet weapon.
941,"00:48:19,105","00:48:20,448",It sounds delicious.
942,"00:48:20,606","00:48:22,825","Delicious, yet quite possibly dangerous."
943,"00:48:22,983","00:48:25,657","He's talking about
an Ultimate Ultimate Weapon."
944,"00:48:25,820","00:48:28,414","That's what I said,
the Ultimate Omelet Weapon."
945,"00:48:28,572","00:48:30,074","Sir, where are you going?"
946,"00:48:30,241","00:48:33,745","This is pure warrior stuff.
Alone in the field, tracking ninjas."
947,"00:48:33,911","00:48:35,504",Finding out exactly what La-Loyd meant
948,"00:48:35,663","00:48:37,290","when he said,
""I wish you weren't my father."""
949,"00:48:37,873","00:48:39,295","So, I guess I'm going to the jungle."
950,"00:48:50,261","00:48:51,683",Ah!Ah!
951,"00:49:06,569","00:49:08,321","Dope fluting, Master Wu."
952,"00:49:08,487","00:49:09,534",Thank you.
953,"00:49:11,740","00:49:13,037","Students,"
954,"00:49:13,200","00:49:18,081","your elemental powers come from
this lush green world."
955,"00:49:18,622","00:49:22,422",Feel the energy flowing through you.
956,"00:49:24,336","00:49:26,304",Good. Good.
957,"00:49:26,464","00:49:29,684",The power is inside you.
958,"00:49:30,593","00:49:32,971","Now say to yourself,"
959,"00:49:33,137","00:49:35,560","""I've got the power."""
960,"00:49:38,934","00:49:40,026",I've got the power!
961,"00:49:41,020","00:49:42,192",What was that?
962,"00:49:45,566","00:49:47,364",Hmm. Ninja tracks!
963,"00:49:49,487","00:49:51,910",I sense the presence of evil.
964,"00:49:52,448","00:49:54,871","Students, true ninja
knows when to fight"
965,"00:49:55,034","00:49:57,412","and when to become
one with the elements."
966,"00:49:57,578","00:49:59,421","Quickly, blend in the shadows."
967,"00:50:02,708","00:50:04,710",You are all terrible ninjas.
968,"00:50:04,877","00:50:07,221",I will take care of Garmadon on my own.
969,"00:50:07,379","00:50:08,380",I'm close.
970,"00:50:08,547","00:50:10,470","- He's close.
- Real close."
971,"00:50:10,633","00:50:11,976",Really close.
972,"00:50:19,016","00:50:20,108","- You!
- You!"
973,"00:50:20,309","00:50:22,562","- Hmm.
- Hmm."
974,"00:50:33,322","00:50:34,824","Oh. Hello, brother."
975,"00:50:34,990","00:50:38,585","Where are you little ninja...
Where are your little ninja nerds?"
976,"00:50:38,744","00:50:39,745",Pfft. Nailed it.
977,"00:50:39,912","00:50:42,756","They are surrounding you,
perfectly hidden. Ready to strike."
978,"00:50:42,915","00:50:43,962","Oh, really?"
979,"00:50:44,500","00:50:45,843",Ca-caw! Ca-caw!
980,"00:50:46,585","00:50:49,885","Students, next lesson.
How to fight like a true ninja..."
981,"00:50:57,513","00:50:58,685",Ow!
982,"00:50:59,223","00:51:00,725",Ow! Ow!
983,"00:51:05,938","00:51:07,064",Uh!
984,"00:51:10,484","00:51:13,533",Oh! Look at me! I'm Master Wu!
985,"00:51:13,696","00:51:16,449","Today's lesson is
something totally boring!"
986,"00:51:21,537","00:51:25,417","Looks like you need a lesson
in learning how to shut your stupid face."
987,"00:51:25,624","00:51:27,376","Well, here's something
you won't learn in school,"
988,"00:51:27,543","00:51:29,511",the Seven Deadly Butterflies of Shaolin.
989,"00:51:29,670","00:51:31,047","One, two, three, four, five, six, seven!"
990,"00:51:31,213","00:51:32,806","I don't need a deadly butterfly
to beat you."
991,"00:51:35,884","00:51:37,511",We are totes blending in right now.
992,"00:51:37,678","00:51:38,770",I can still see you!
993,"00:51:38,929","00:51:40,351","- Oh, man.
- Come on, this way."
994,"00:51:53,068","00:51:54,911","Ho, ho! Wu's your daddy?"
995,"00:51:56,405","00:51:57,452",Ow!
996,"00:51:58,157","00:51:59,158",Ha!
997,"00:52:01,243","00:52:03,416","- Get off of my head.
- Hey, bro, get off my foot!"
998,"00:52:03,579","00:52:05,047","- Get off!
- No, you get off my foot"
999,"00:52:05,205","00:52:06,422",so I can kick you in the head.
1000,"00:52:13,172","00:52:14,389",Whoa!
1001,"00:52:18,844","00:52:19,845",Master Wu!
1002,"00:52:19,970","00:52:22,268","- Look out! He's behind you!
- Where?"
1003,"00:52:26,393","00:52:28,691",Really? Tighty-whities? sun?
1004,"00:52:28,896","00:52:30,398","Face it, you're out of moves, Wu."
1005,"00:52:30,564","00:52:32,532","Oh, yeah? How about this one?"
1006,"00:52:32,691","00:52:33,783",Oh.
1007,"00:52:35,319","00:52:37,413",I call it the Caged Monkey.
1008,"00:52:37,571","00:52:39,744","Oh, you have got to be kidding me!"
1009,"00:52:39,990","00:52:40,991",Gasp.
1010,"00:52:41,158","00:52:45,038","And that, my students,
is how you fight like a true ninja."
1011,"00:52:46,372","00:52:49,797","Huh. Well, a true ninja would have
counted all seven butterflies."
1012,"00:52:49,958","00:52:51,301",What? I did.
1013,"00:52:51,460","00:52:53,758","One, two, three, four, five, six..."
1014,"00:52:53,921","00:52:54,922",Seven.
1015,"00:52:56,465","00:52:57,591",Whoa!
1016,"00:53:00,511","00:53:01,854",No!
1017,"00:53:25,494","00:53:26,495",Master Wu!
1018,"00:53:26,704","00:53:29,048","Lloyd, always remember..."
1019,"00:53:29,248","00:53:30,295",Yeah?
1020,"00:53:30,499","00:53:34,129","Stay on the right path
to find your inner peace."
1021,"00:53:34,420","00:53:35,467","- No, no, no.
- Oh, my gosh!"
1022,"00:53:35,629","00:53:37,006","We need you, please! Don't leave!"
1023,"00:53:37,172","00:53:38,719",Uncle Wu!
1024,"00:53:38,882","00:53:40,634",Did he say inner peace?
1025,"00:53:40,801","00:53:42,053",The right path?
1026,"00:53:42,219","00:53:45,018","Why is he bringing these things up
so late in our adventure?"
1027,"00:53:45,180","00:53:46,557","Well, well, well."
1028,"00:53:51,520","00:53:54,194","Looks like your precious
ninja master's gone."
1029,"00:53:55,774","00:53:57,151","Now, come on, La-Loyd."
1030,"00:53:57,359","00:53:59,657",Open the cage. Let out your papa.
1031,"00:53:59,945","00:54:01,492","So, now you wanna be my dad?"
1032,"00:54:01,697","00:54:05,418","I'm not gonna ask you again, La-Loyd.
Open the cage right now."
1033,"00:54:06,243","00:54:07,244",One...
1034,"00:54:08,912","00:54:09,913",Two...
1035,"00:54:11,373","00:54:12,374",Three...
1036,"00:54:14,543","00:54:17,046","Hmm. I thought that was
supposed to work with kids."
1037,"00:54:17,212","00:54:19,931","Listen, La-Loyd and friends
whose names I don't know..."
1038,"00:54:20,090","00:54:21,592","- I'm Jay.
- It's not a question."
1039,"00:54:21,967","00:54:23,014",Oh.
1040,"00:54:24,178","00:54:26,146","Now. For you to make it
through this journey alive,"
1041,"00:54:26,305","00:54:28,478","you're gonna need someone
to teach you the ninja way."
1042,"00:54:28,682","00:54:29,979",What do you know about being a ninja?
1043,"00:54:30,184","00:54:32,357","Oh, I know plenty, La-Loyd."
1044,"00:54:32,561","00:54:33,733",You don't get to be a warlord
1045,"00:54:33,896","00:54:35,773","without knowing a thing or two
about the ninja arts."
1046,"00:54:35,939","00:54:37,907",The dark ninja arts.
1047,"00:54:40,277","00:54:41,324",What is that?
1048,"00:54:41,487","00:54:42,534",You're a ninja?
1049,"00:54:42,696","00:54:43,743","Indeed, I am."
1050,"00:54:43,906","00:54:46,409","As a matter of fact,
I wrote the book on Ninjelligence."
1051,"00:54:46,575","00:54:48,794",Why are there so many one-star reviews?
1052,"00:54:48,952","00:54:51,250","- I think that's trolls, personally.
- Oh."
1053,"00:54:51,413","00:54:53,916","We don't need your book, Garmadon.
Wu is our master."
1054,"00:54:54,082","00:54:55,675","Well, Wu is gone."
1055,"00:54:55,834","00:54:57,882","And you're gonna need me
to get you out of this jungle"
1056,"00:54:58,045","00:54:59,092",or you're all gonna die.
1057,"00:54:59,254","00:55:00,927","Oh, great! We're all gonna die."
1058,"00:55:01,089","00:55:02,466","We're not gonna die, Jay."
1059,"00:55:02,633","00:55:04,431","And while I'm keeping you alive,"
1060,"00:55:04,593","00:55:07,437","maybe I'll teach you some of my
sick dark ninja moves,"
1061,"00:55:07,596","00:55:09,690","- like the Buzzkill.
- Wow."
1062,"00:55:10,098","00:55:11,645","- The Miso Slap.
- Wow."
1063,"00:55:11,850","00:55:13,397","- Or the Chainsaw Chop.
- Wow."
1064,"00:55:13,644","00:55:15,191","- Or the Dance of Doom.
- Wow."
1065,"00:55:15,395","00:55:18,990","Hang on just a second.
This is Garmadon we're talking about."
1066,"00:55:19,149","00:55:22,244","We can still make it to
the Ultimate Ultimate Weapon on our own."
1067,"00:55:22,402","00:55:24,780","We just have to remember
what Master Wu taught us."
1068,"00:55:24,947","00:55:27,746","All I can remember is
we really need a ninja master."
1069,"00:55:27,908","00:55:30,377",And you are not a ninja master.
1070,"00:55:31,787","00:55:33,255",So what are we gonna do?
1071,"00:55:35,207","00:55:36,208",We take him.
1072,"00:55:36,375","00:55:37,672",Fantastic!
1073,"00:55:40,254","00:55:41,426",You know what's funny?
1074,"00:55:41,588","00:55:44,762",I had La-Loyd when I was 158 years old.
1075,"00:55:44,883","00:55:46,510",Wait a minute.
1076,"00:55:46,677","00:55:49,271","- You're 174?
- Yes."
1077,"00:55:49,429","00:55:52,023",Master Wu says he's 167
1078,"00:55:52,182","00:55:54,981","- and he's your younger brother?
- He's my younger brother. Correct."
1079,"00:55:55,185","00:55:57,563","How is that possible?
You look much..."
1080,"00:55:57,896","00:55:58,897",Younger.
1081,"00:55:59,106","00:56:00,824","- Thank you.
- Yeah, do you moisturize?"
1082,"00:56:00,983","00:56:03,031","Yes, that's when I got
the upper hand on Master Wu."
1083,"00:56:03,193","00:56:04,991","- ""Upper hands.""
- Yeah, upper hands."
1084,"00:56:05,153","00:56:06,279",How did you gain two arms?
1085,"00:56:06,488","00:56:07,740","Oh, don't put it like that."
1086,"00:56:07,948","00:56:09,666","I don't know if that's
the best way to say it."
1087,"00:56:09,825","00:56:11,327","- Well, he's got four arms.
- Correct!"
1088,"00:56:11,493","00:56:12,915","You know, a lot of people
don't ask me about it."
1089,"00:56:13,078","00:56:14,796","So, I'm glad that
he's comfortable asking."
1090,"00:56:14,955","00:56:16,002","Lloyd's never asked me once
about my arms."
1091,"00:56:16,164","00:56:18,337","- Have you, Lloyd?
- Don't talk to me."
1092,"00:56:18,500","00:56:19,501",I was bit by a snake.
1093,"00:56:19,668","00:56:20,669","- No!
- Yes."
1094,"00:56:20,836","00:56:21,928",So the snake had a bunch of arms?
1095,"00:56:22,087","00:56:23,634","- They don't have arms.
- Exactly."
1096,"00:56:23,797","00:56:26,095","- Do you mean like a spider?
- Oh, no, I was bit by a snake."
1097,"00:56:26,258","00:56:27,510","And the snake
had been bitten by a spider."
1098,"00:56:27,676","00:56:28,677",And then the snake bit me.
1099,"00:56:29,094","00:56:31,096","Are you guys actually
buying any of this?"
1100,"00:56:31,263","00:56:33,186","How else would you explain it, La-Loyd?
You weren't there."
1101,"00:56:33,348","00:56:36,227","When the two extra arms started growing,
were you like, ""Yes, this is awesome!"""
1102,"00:56:36,393","00:56:38,361","No, at first,
I was totally freaked out..."
1103,"00:56:38,520","00:56:40,989","and sometimes
I get self-conscious about it."
1104,"00:56:42,357","00:56:43,574","Hey, Garmadon."
1105,"00:56:43,734","00:56:45,361","- Can I ask you another question?
- Yeah, go ahead."
1106,"00:56:45,527","00:56:48,906","It's about the arms.
Um, can you shake your own hand?"
1107,"00:56:49,072","00:56:50,824","Look! Check it out, ninjas."
1108,"00:56:51,325","00:56:52,668",He's his own best friend!
1109,"00:56:52,826","00:56:53,998",The double shake!
1110,"00:56:54,202","00:56:55,328",I love your bad boy charm.
1111,"00:56:55,537","00:56:57,084","Look at this.
This is one of my favorite things."
1112,"00:56:57,247","00:56:58,920","I look like I'm making out
with two people, don't I?"
1113,"00:56:59,082","00:57:01,301","- I'm impressed.
- Wonderful amusement!"
1114,"00:57:01,460","00:57:05,431","Hey, you know what? We should
be practicing silence right now."
1115,"00:57:05,589","00:57:06,590",Sorry.
1116,"00:57:06,757","00:57:09,476","It's just, when you talk,
I don't wanna listen,"
1117,"00:57:09,635","00:57:11,603","but when he talks, I wanna listen."
1118,"00:57:11,762","00:57:12,763",I agree. I agree.
1119,"00:57:12,971","00:57:14,314",I've always said he's weak-voiced.
1120,"00:57:14,514","00:57:16,687","I think we're gettin' off point
a little bit, just a little bit."
1121,"00:57:16,850","00:57:19,023","You see what I mean about
the weak voice? ""Like a little bit!"""
1122,"00:57:19,186","00:57:20,187","- That's how he talks.
- Do it again."
1123,"00:57:20,395","00:57:21,942","""A little bit!"""
1124,"00:57:22,189","00:57:24,283","Oh, that's not how I...
That doesn't sound like me!"
1125,"00:57:24,441","00:57:26,284",His sounds more like this.
1126,"00:57:26,568","00:57:27,820",Look what he's doing to us!
1127,"00:57:27,986","00:57:29,954","We have to focus.
He's turning our minds."
1128,"00:57:30,155","00:57:31,623","Thank you, Zane. You get it."
1129,"00:57:32,115","00:57:34,584",My sensors indicate a fork in the road.
1130,"00:57:35,619","00:57:36,836",Hmm.
1131,"00:57:37,454","00:57:40,503","The right path is long,
and arduous, and enlightening."
1132,"00:57:40,666","00:57:43,010",And the left... A shortcut!
1133,"00:57:43,543","00:57:46,342","Why would they say ""possible""?
They would know, right?"
1134,"00:57:46,505","00:57:47,882",We're taking the shortcut. Let's roll!
1135,"00:57:48,048","00:57:49,675","No, no. Okay. Just wait."
1136,"00:57:49,841","00:57:51,969","Master Wu said we should stay
on the right path."
1137,"00:57:52,135","00:57:54,558","What? You wanna listen
to the guy who fell off the bridge"
1138,"00:57:54,721","00:57:56,473","or the guy who didn't
fall off the bridge?"
1139,"00:57:59,518","00:58:02,738","Hey, Zane, could you record this
and then never play it back to me?"
1140,"00:58:02,896","00:58:03,988",Yes.
1141,"00:58:07,234","00:58:08,235",Um... Guys?
1142,"00:58:09,403","00:58:11,451",Maybe this isn't such a great idea.
1143,"00:58:19,246","00:58:21,795","This is my least favorite place
I've ever been in."
1144,"00:58:22,249","00:58:23,466",Did you hear that?
1145,"00:58:27,212","00:58:28,964","- We're backing it out.
- What?"
1146,"00:58:29,131","00:58:30,633","- We're backing out.
- What did you just say?"
1147,"00:58:30,799","00:58:31,846","GO, go, go:"
1148,"00:58:32,009","00:58:35,183","Back it. Continue to back it out.
Continue to back it out."
1149,"00:58:35,345","00:58:36,892",Alert. More danger.
1150,"00:58:37,055","00:58:38,773","- I'm gonna throw up.
- What do we do?"
1151,"00:58:38,932","00:58:39,933",There's too many of them.
1152,"00:58:40,100","00:58:43,149","Wait a minute.
Oh, my gosh. La-Loyd,"
1153,"00:58:43,311","00:58:46,815","they look like
my former General Number Ones."
1154,"00:58:46,982","00:58:48,404",You guys look great.
1155,"00:58:48,567","00:58:50,114",Your skin has such a lovely glow.
1156,"00:58:50,277","00:58:51,779","Have you all been tanning
lately or something?"
1157,"00:58:51,945","00:58:54,073",We were fired.
1158,"00:58:56,533","00:58:59,662",Out of a volcano.
1159,"00:58:59,828","00:59:01,922","Oh, right, right, right."
1160,"00:59:02,080","00:59:03,502","Yeah, but other than that, you're well?"
1161,"00:59:03,665","00:59:04,712","Uh, Garmadon,"
1162,"00:59:04,875","00:59:08,345","did you fire all of these generals
out of a volcano?"
1163,"00:59:09,087","00:59:11,931",No! Not all at the same time.
1164,"00:59:12,090","00:59:14,388","Don't worry. These guys are like family.
They love me."
1165,"00:59:14,551","00:59:15,928","Right, Generals?"
1166,"00:59:17,721","00:59:20,349","Oh, oh. We're family all right."
1167,"00:59:20,515","00:59:21,607","Ninja, go!"
1168,"00:59:21,767","00:59:22,768","Guys, wait!"
1169,"00:59:22,934","00:59:24,777",We need to use our ninja powers.
1170,"00:59:24,936","00:59:26,984","What do we do?
We're worthless without our mechs."
1171,"00:59:27,189","00:59:29,362","Come on.
Remember what Master Wu told us."
1172,"00:59:29,524","00:59:32,073","Nya, you can make a flood
to wash these guys outta here."
1173,"00:59:32,235","00:59:34,954","The only hope for water is if Jay
has another accident in his pants."
1174,"00:59:35,113","00:59:37,081","Yeah, she's right.
We gotta get outta here!"
1175,"00:59:37,240","00:59:38,537","- Ow, that hurts.
- Let's go."
1176,"00:59:38,700","00:59:40,828","No, no, guys.
Use your elemental powers."
1177,"00:59:41,703","00:59:43,080",We have the power!
1178,"00:59:46,458","00:59:48,426",We got Garmadon!
1179,"00:59:48,710","00:59:50,633",And this random kid!
1180,"00:59:50,837","00:59:52,931",We are going to kill them.
1181,"00:59:53,090","00:59:55,138","Oops, we shouldn't have said that."
1182,"00:59:55,342","00:59:58,721","I command you to release me and my son.
That's an order, Generals."
1183,"00:59:58,929","01:00:00,351",I can't hear you!
1184,"01:00:00,555","01:00:03,104","I said, I command you
to release me and my son."
1185,"01:00:03,308","01:00:06,027","Hey, the reason Bob can't hear"
1186,"01:00:06,186","01:00:09,861","is because his eardrums blew up
after you shot him out of the volcano!"
1187,"01:00:10,023","01:00:11,400",I can't hear you!
1188,"01:00:11,566","01:00:12,783",You stupid butt!
1189,"01:00:12,943","01:00:15,162","What?
Can you believe what they're saying?"
1190,"01:00:15,320","01:00:18,073","It's like I'm being treated worse
than anyone in the history of the world."
1191,"01:00:18,240","01:00:20,993","A good thing you never have to
experience anything like this, La-Loyd."
1192,"01:00:21,201","01:00:24,171","Yeah. Yeah.
No one ever says mean things to me"
1193,"01:00:24,329","01:00:27,299","when my dad knocks over
their Pilates studio,"
1194,"01:00:27,457","01:00:30,506","or their waxing salon,
or their kayak repair store,"
1195,"01:00:30,669","01:00:32,637","or that place
that sells toner cartridges,"
1196,"01:00:32,796","01:00:36,300","and you better believe
no one ever makes fun of me"
1197,"01:00:36,466","01:00:38,560","for not knowing
how to throw or catch a ball."
1198,"01:00:38,718","01:00:40,595","Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Hold on."
1199,"01:00:40,762","01:00:43,515","I know it's funny, but what kind of jerk
would make fun of you for that?"
1200,"01:00:43,682","01:00:44,683","You're kidding, right?"
1201,"01:00:44,850","01:00:47,228","You gotta stand up for yourself,
and shoot them out of a volcano."
1202,"01:00:47,394","01:00:48,441",That's how I roll.
1203,"01:00:48,603","01:00:50,480","You gotta get yourself a volcano, kid."
1204,"01:00:51,189","01:00:52,611",Heh. Yeah.
1205,"01:00:52,774","01:00:56,529","Blowing stuff up
and never putting it back together."
1206,"01:00:57,112","01:01:00,582","That is what you're best at, isn't it?"
1207,"01:01:03,368","01:01:04,665","Well, hello!"
1208,"01:01:04,828","01:01:07,206",We have got a present for you.
1209,"01:01:07,372","01:01:09,795",Fire him! Fire him! Fire him!
1210,"01:01:10,000","01:01:12,469","An exact reproduction
of my volcanic lair."
1211,"01:01:12,627","01:01:14,880","And let me guess,
you're going to fire us out of it."
1212,"01:01:15,046","01:01:19,017","Oh, no, we're gonna fire you
into the volcano."
1213,"01:01:19,217","01:01:21,845","The 15 million kelvin magma
will melt your skin"
1214,"01:01:22,012","01:01:23,730",before you can even feel the heat!
1215,"01:01:23,889","01:01:26,358","Omar, take them to the top."
1216,"01:01:26,558","01:01:27,684",Okeydokey.
1217,"01:01:28,101","01:01:29,569",Up you go!
1218,"01:01:36,943","01:01:39,196",Whoa. Oh. Oh.
1219,"01:01:39,487","01:01:40,579",Ah! What is that?
1220,"01:01:40,739","01:01:42,241","- Hey!
- What's up?"
1221,"01:01:44,075","01:01:45,577",Zane! Are you okay?
1222,"01:01:45,744","01:01:47,667",I think I might be an adrenaline junkie.
1223,"01:01:47,829","01:01:49,331","I got you, dude! I got you!"
1224,"01:01:49,497","01:01:51,044","I really could've walked out by myself,"
1225,"01:01:51,208","01:01:52,425",but thank you. Ow.
1226,"01:01:53,376","01:01:54,969","Wait, where's Lloyd?"
1227,"01:01:55,128","01:01:56,345","- Um...
- Uh..."
1228,"01:01:56,588","01:02:00,092","Oh, no. I can't believe we just ran off
and left him back there."
1229,"01:02:00,300","01:02:02,894","- This is terrible.
- We are horrible friends."
1230,"01:02:03,094","01:02:04,937","And subpar ninjas, too."
1231,"01:02:05,138","01:02:08,017","- That's right. That's right.
- Wait. Guys..."
1232,"01:02:10,060","01:02:12,108",Fire him! Fire him!
1233,"01:02:12,270","01:02:14,443","- Oh, no!
- Lloyd!"
1234,"01:02:14,606","01:02:17,075","- He's in trouble.
- Oh, man. What are we going to do?"
1235,"01:02:17,275","01:02:18,822","We can still do this, guys."
1236,"01:02:18,985","01:02:22,205","We just gotta figure out
how to be real ninjas."
1237,"01:02:22,405","01:02:23,827",You know what would be really brave?
1238,"01:02:23,990","01:02:26,413","Making camp, sleeping for the night,
wake up in the day."
1239,"01:02:26,576","01:02:27,577","Yeah, that's brave."
1240,"01:02:27,744","01:02:30,714","Wait, Zane, don't you have 700 gigabytes"
1241,"01:02:30,872","01:02:32,340","of martial arts movies
on your hard drive?"
1242,"01:02:34,376","01:02:35,923","- Correct!

1256,"01:03:01,027","01:03:04,122",Time to get down and dirty. Ninja style.
1257,"01:03:04,281","01:03:05,498","- Oh, yeah.
- Right!"
1258,"01:03:11,621","01:03:13,168",Whoa! Is that a whale?

1260,"01:03:24,718","01:03:26,561",Time to blend in.

How did you all get up here?"
1269,"01:03:56,583","01:03:58,210","Oh, man. We did all that stuff"
1270,"01:03:58,376","01:04:01,050","that you and Master Wu told us to do.
Ninja style, bro."
1271,"01:04:01,254","01:04:03,882","- Whoa!
- All right. Let's get outta here"
1272,"01:04:04,049","01:04:05,892","and make it to
the Ultimate Ultimate Weapon."
1273,"01:04:06,051","01:04:07,803","That's not gonna be easy, girl ninja."
1274,"01:04:07,969","01:04:10,392","Because I fired
a ridic amount of generals."
1275,"01:04:10,555","01:04:11,977","All right, all right.
I got an idea."
1276,"01:04:12,140","01:04:14,188","If we can hold
these generals off long enough,"
1277,"01:04:14,351","01:04:15,773",we can build a way out of here.
1278,"01:04:15,935","01:04:19,109","Great idea. You kids start building.
La-Loyd and I will throw you bricks."
1279,"01:04:19,272","01:04:20,899","Lloyd, I need a two-by-two."

1287,"01:04:31,743","01:04:33,837","You ninjas, keep at it.
La-Loyd, you're coming with me."
1288,"01:04:33,995","01:04:36,919","I'll be in charge of the tunes.
I'll just put it on shuffle here."

how to throw."
1293,"01:04:58,436","01:04:59,437",Come on!

1297,"01:05:17,247","01:05:18,248",Whoa!
1298,"01:05:19,958","01:05:21,676","Lloyd! Over here, I'm open."
1299,"01:05:22,168","01:05:24,216",Okay. All right. I can... I can do this.
1300,"01:05:24,379","01:05:27,349","- Quiet your mind, La-Loyd.
- Okay."
1301,"01:05:27,507","01:05:30,351","Throw like no one's watching
except your judging father."
1302,"01:05:30,510","01:05:31,511",Not helping.
1303,"01:05:31,678","01:05:34,397","Oh, right. You got this. Do it."
1304,"01:05:38,059","01:05:39,276",Whoa!
1305,"01:05:39,602","01:05:40,945","- La-Loyd.
- Yes!"
1306,"01:05:41,104","01:05:42,856","Look at that. I actually taught you
how to do something."
1307,"01:05:43,022","01:05:44,023",Right?
1308,"01:05:44,190","01:05:46,033","- Nice! Dude, that was awesome!
- You did it, Lloyd!"
1309,"01:05:46,192","01:05:47,364","Cole, catch."
1310,"01:05:47,527","01:05:49,325","- Kai.
- Right here, I'm open!"
1311,"01:05:49,487","01:05:50,534","- Great throw.
- Give me another. Quick!"
1312,"01:05:50,697","01:05:52,199","Zane, your turn, buddy."
1313,"01:05:53,992","01:05:55,665",You've got a cannon for an arm.
1314,"01:05:55,827","01:05:57,079","Seriously, an awesome throw."
1315,"01:06:01,875","01:06:03,718","La-Loyd, something's
happening to my face."
1316,"01:06:03,877","01:06:05,879","It's turning upwards
in an unfamiliar motion."
1317,"01:06:06,045","01:06:07,513",I think they've deployed nerve gas!
1318,"01:06:07,672","01:06:09,299","It's happening to you, too!"
1319,"01:06:09,466","01:06:11,719","Listen, listen. We're smiling!"
1320,"01:06:11,885","01:06:14,104","What is this ""smiling""?"
1321,"01:06:14,304","01:06:16,056","Go with it! It feels good, right?"
1322,"01:06:16,222","01:06:19,351","It does. This whole experience
is so foreign to me."
1323,"01:06:19,517","01:06:21,235","- I know, right?
- Yeah!"
1324,"01:06:21,394","01:06:23,988","- All right, here it comes.
- La-Loyd!"
1325,"01:06:30,778","01:06:31,825",Time to fire you out...
1326,"01:06:33,823","01:06:34,824",La-Loyd!
1327,"01:06:37,327","01:06:38,419","La-Loyd, are you okay?"
1328,"01:06:38,578","01:06:40,751","Yeah, yeah! I think it was my arm.
Is it bad?"
1329,"01:06:40,914","01:06:42,507","- Whoa!
- I don't wanna look!"
1330,"01:06:42,665","01:06:45,088","It looks okay, I guess."
1331,"01:06:45,293","01:06:46,920","Scale of one to 10, how bad is it?"
1332,"01:06:47,128","01:06:51,304","Oh, I'd say it's about a seven-point...
Arm-ripped-off."
1333,"01:06:51,508","01:06:53,226",My arm is what? Say it one more time?
1334,"01:06:53,426","01:06:55,599","Just, don't look down.
Don't look down below your neck."
1335,"01:06:55,803","01:06:57,396","Don't do that face.
Why are you doing that face?"
1336,"01:06:57,597","01:06:59,565",It's just a harmless little...
1337,"01:07:00,016","01:07:02,314",I gotta puke. It's disgusting.
1338,"01:07:02,519","01:07:03,691",Should I look?
1339,"01:07:03,895","01:07:06,489","I looked! I have no arm!
I have no arm! No!"
1340,"01:07:06,648","01:07:07,649",I told you it was bad.
1341,"01:07:07,774","01:07:10,948","Oh! That's way worse than anything
I could have thought! That's bad!"
1342,"01:07:11,110","01:07:12,737","You're gonna be fine.
Let me text your mother."
1343,"01:07:13,363","01:07:14,956","Dad, no! I need you! Stay with me!"
1344,"01:07:15,114","01:07:17,367","Be here with me right now, all right?
Do something."
1345,"01:07:17,534","01:07:20,583","All right, I'm gonna find it.
What does it look like?"
1346,"01:07:20,745","01:07:23,919","It looks like my left arm,
except it's the right one."
1347,"01:07:24,123","01:07:25,124","Oh. Of course, yes."
1348,"01:07:25,291","01:07:27,669","Okay, everybody, fan out, form a grid.
Find La-Loyd's arm."
1349,"01:07:27,794","01:07:29,512",It's got a little hand like a cup holder
1350,"01:07:29,671","01:07:31,890","and a black sleeve
and a little piece of green on it."
1351,"01:07:32,048","01:07:35,268","You'll know it when you see it.
It's La-Loyd's arm, for heaven's sake."
1352,"01:07:35,426","01:07:36,894","- Does this look like it?
- No."
1353,"01:07:37,053","01:07:38,179","All right, let's try this arm out."
1354,"01:07:38,388","01:07:40,561","- That's a leg.
- Have you ever had an arm that kicks?"
1355,"01:07:40,723","01:07:42,896","- I mean, that could be cool.
- Can't say I have."
1356,"01:07:43,434","01:07:45,277","Hey, how about this one?"
1357,"01:07:45,436","01:07:47,404",That's a sword. That's a sword!
1358,"01:07:47,605","01:07:49,607","Oh, man, to have a sword arm,
that'd be sweet!"
1359,"01:07:49,774","01:07:52,994","You know, the idea of it
is a lot cooler than the reality."
1360,"01:07:53,987","01:07:56,115",Wait a minute. Found it!
1361,"01:07:56,322","01:07:57,619","- Here we go!
- Okay."
1362,"01:07:58,199","01:08:00,293",I'm gonna pop that arm back into place.
1363,"01:08:00,493","01:08:03,542","Okay, wait, wait, wait. But it's only
gonna hurt for a second, right?"
1364,"01:08:03,705","01:08:06,504","Hurt for a second? No!
This is gonna be agony for a while."
1365,"01:08:06,666","01:08:07,758",Who gave you that misinformation?
1366,"01:08:07,917","01:08:09,794","All right, all right, all right.
Just do it, just do it, just do it."
1367,"01:08:09,961","01:08:12,464",Okay. On the count of 12...
1368,"01:08:12,672","01:08:14,345","No, no, no. I don't wanna do 12."
1369,"01:08:14,507","01:08:16,430","Let's do... Let's do like a,
you know, three."
1370,"01:08:16,593","01:08:18,015","Okay, three."
1371,"01:08:18,928","01:08:19,929","One,"
1372,"01:08:20,096","01:08:21,473",two...
1373,"01:08:21,639","01:08:23,141",Oh! I wish your mom was here to do this.
1374,"01:08:23,308","01:08:24,855",You're killing me. You gotta just do it.
1375,"01:08:25,059","01:08:26,857","All right. One,"
1376,"01:08:27,020","01:08:28,192","two,"
1377,"01:08:28,730","01:08:29,731",three.
1378,"01:08:31,190","01:08:32,567",Wow.
1379,"01:08:32,817","01:08:34,945","It, uh, feels..."
1380,"01:08:35,778","01:08:36,870",It feels pretty good.
1381,"01:08:37,030","01:08:39,579",Feels pretty good.
1382,"01:08:39,991","01:08:42,870","You did that, put my arm back on,"
1383,"01:08:43,036","01:08:44,834",like a real dad.
1384,"01:08:46,122","01:08:49,296","- You called me ""Dad.""
- Yeah."
1385,"01:08:49,500","01:08:52,049","Wow. I guess I...
I guess I did."
1386,"01:08:52,211","01:08:54,464","I really stepped up there
in kind of a ""Dad"" way."
1387,"01:08:55,131","01:08:56,223",Right?
1388,"01:08:56,382","01:08:58,350","Lloyd, come on! We gotta get outta here!"
1389,"01:08:58,551","01:09:00,428","- Come on!
- Run! Run!"
1390,"01:09:00,595","01:09:01,847","Guys, we have to go."
1391,"01:09:02,013","01:09:04,482","- Hurry!
- Come on!"
1392,"01:09:04,682","01:09:05,683",Let's get moving.
1393,"01:09:05,850","01:09:07,067","Come on, everybody, let's go!"
1394,"01:09:08,686","01:09:09,812",I can't believe it worked!
1395,"01:09:09,979","01:09:12,232","Temple, here we come!"
1396,"01:09:14,359","01:09:16,828","Hey, La-Loyd, let me show you
how to fly this thing."
1397,"01:09:16,986","01:09:18,363","Hands, 10 and two."
1398,"01:09:19,322","01:09:21,620",I build and drive mechs all the time.
1399,"01:09:21,824","01:09:22,916",I think I'm good.
1400,"01:09:23,117","01:09:26,087","Oh. Okay. Yeah, you're probably right."
1401,"01:09:30,083","01:09:31,335",Um...
1402,"01:09:32,085","01:09:34,087",What were you saying? 10 and...
1403,"01:09:34,671","01:09:35,888","- Oh, two! 10 and two.
- Oh, two. Two."
1404,"01:09:36,089","01:09:37,511","- Yeah, just 10 and two.
- Okay. All right, all right."
1405,"01:09:37,674","01:09:39,221","That's kind of a rule
of thumb in driving."
1406,"01:09:39,384","01:09:41,057","- That's good to know.
- Don't forget to check your rearview."
1407,"01:09:41,219","01:09:43,438","You wanna see what's back there.
You have blind spots everywhere."
1408,"01:09:43,596","01:09:44,597","Rearview, check."
1409,"01:09:44,764","01:09:47,483","Keep your eyes peeled.
You really wanna be looking ahead."
1410,"01:09:47,725","01:09:49,477","Noted, thank you."
1411,"01:09:49,644","01:09:50,816","You want me to really
open this thing up?"
1412,"01:09:50,937","01:09:52,484","Sure. Yeah, let's see what it can do."
1413,"01:09:52,689","01:09:53,781",Okay.
1414,"01:09:55,108","01:09:56,200",Yeah!
1415,"01:10:00,363","01:10:02,616","- Okay, that's enough! That's too fast.
- You didn't like that?"
1416,"01:10:02,824","01:10:05,418","I mean, I liked it. If I was driving,
I would be fine with it."
1417,"01:10:05,576","01:10:07,499","Sure, sure. Right. I felt
a little scared. Were you scared?"
1418,"01:10:07,662","01:10:10,962","Uh, yeah. I'm not gonna lie,
I might need a change of armor."
1419,"01:10:11,791","01:10:13,384","Yeah, I want you to
guard the brake a little bit."
1420,"01:10:13,543","01:10:14,840","Okay. Okay, got it."
1421,"01:10:15,670","01:10:17,638","You're doing great, buddy,
this is going real... Goat!"
1422,"01:10:18,715","01:10:19,807","Goat, goat, goat!"
1423,"01:10:39,277","01:10:40,529",Is everyone okay?
1424,"01:10:40,695","01:10:41,992",Not really.
1425,"01:10:43,281","01:10:47,957","Behold, the Temple of Fragile Foundations."
1426,"01:10:48,870","01:10:50,463",Whoa! Whoa!
1427,"01:10:50,705","01:10:53,675","The helicopter crash
has destabilized the entire area."
1428,"01:10:53,833","01:10:54,959","And I'm not blaming anyone,"
1429,"01:10:55,126","01:10:57,720","but if I ever see that goat again,
he and I are gonna have words."
1430,"01:10:57,879","01:10:59,881","And you can bet some of those words
are gonna have four letters."
1431,"01:11:00,006","01:11:01,679","And I'm not talking about ""goat."""
1432,"01:11:02,759","01:11:04,181",Give us the first letter.
1433,"01:11:09,474","01:11:12,193","This is my new least favorite
place I've ever been."
1434,"01:11:12,351","01:11:15,696","I've spent a lot
of time here, and trust me,"
1435,"01:11:15,855","01:11:17,357",doesn't get any better.
1436,"01:11:17,565","01:11:21,820","Wait a minute.
So, you know this place?"
1437,"01:11:21,986","01:11:23,579",Who doesn't know...
1438,"01:11:26,199","01:11:27,667",...their childhood home?
1439,"01:11:29,202","01:11:31,671","Yeah, this place is so unstable,"
1440,"01:11:31,829","01:11:34,457","I had to move to a volcano
just to feel safe."
1441,"01:11:35,958","01:11:37,881","Well, shall we?"
1442,"01:11:42,882","01:11:45,180","Stay close.
I will lead you through this perilous..."
1443,"01:11:45,343","01:11:46,765","Oh, look, a light switch."
1444,"01:11:47,303","01:11:49,226","- Is there a bathroom I could use?
- Nope."
1445,"01:11:49,388","01:11:50,765",Fresh fruit!
1446,"01:11:50,932","01:11:52,525","- Finally, food!
- I'm starving!"
1447,"01:11:53,392","01:11:54,564","Ow, I think I chipped a tooth."
1448,"01:11:54,811","01:11:56,529","Yeah, my parents
were really into plastic fruit."
1449,"01:11:56,729","01:11:58,481",Whoa. Check out those old photos.
1450,"01:12:00,399","01:12:01,901",Look at that!
1451,"01:12:02,068","01:12:03,160",They're so cute!
1452,"01:12:03,319","01:12:05,071",Look at his baby goatee!
1453,"01:12:05,238","01:12:08,333","I mean, Master Wu
looks like a really old man."
1454,"01:12:08,616","01:12:11,210","Ha! Ha!
He even schooled you back then."
1455,"01:12:11,577","01:12:14,376","Ugh, whatevz. Come on, let's go find
the Ultimate Ultimate Weapon."
1456,"01:12:14,539","01:12:15,586",Wait.
1457,"01:12:17,416","01:12:19,009",That's... That's you.
1458,"01:12:20,503","01:12:21,504",And that's...
1459,"01:12:21,671","01:12:24,925","It's Lady Iron Dragon, my hero!"
1460,"01:12:25,091","01:12:27,594","Yes, Lady Iron Dragon,"
1461,"01:12:27,760","01:12:30,684",aka La-Loyd's mom.
1462,"01:12:30,847","01:12:32,269","Wait, what?"
1463,"01:12:32,431","01:12:33,808",Mom was a ninja?
1464,"01:12:33,975","01:12:35,101",That's right.
1465,"01:12:35,309","01:12:38,279","She was the most awesome
ninja warrior I'd ever seen."
1466,"01:12:38,437","01:12:41,441","I remember the first time
I laid eyes on her."
1467,"01:12:42,108","01:12:43,860",It was during a raging war.
1468,"01:12:45,194","01:12:48,038","I was pillaging a peaceful village
with my skeleton army"
1469,"01:12:48,197","01:12:50,575","when I spotted
this beautiful warrior queen"
1470,"01:12:50,741","01:12:52,994",from across a crowded battlefield.
1471,"01:12:53,119","01:12:56,749","She was fighting for good
and looking great doing it."
1472,"01:12:56,914","01:12:59,918","Even as she decimated my evil forces,"
1473,"01:13:00,084","01:13:01,631",I couldn't take my eyes off her.
1474,"01:13:02,795","01:13:04,468",I was speechless.
1475,"01:13:05,298","01:13:08,393","I summoned all my courage
to approach her."
1476,"01:13:08,551","01:13:11,145",I asked her if she fought here often.
1477,"01:13:11,304","01:13:14,274","She said, ""I do."""
1478,"01:13:15,308","01:13:16,480","And let me tell you, La-Loyd."
1479,"01:13:17,310","01:13:19,904","When our eyes met, sparks flew."
1480,"01:13:23,399","01:13:27,404",It was love at first fight!
1481,"01:13:29,322","01:13:32,326","Your mother and I
were a true power couple."
1482,"01:13:32,491","01:13:36,041","I thought we were gonna
conquer the world together."
1483,"01:13:42,501","01:13:45,095",It was the happiest time of my life.
1484,"01:13:46,005","01:13:47,302",Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
1485,"01:13:47,465","01:13:51,140","If you guys were so perfect,
then why did you leave us?"
1486,"01:13:52,678","01:13:53,975",It's...
1487,"01:13:55,056","01:13:56,353",Complicated.
1488,"01:13:59,936","01:14:02,280","One day, we came upon NINJAGO."
1489,"01:14:05,358","01:14:06,450",I told your mother
1490,"01:14:06,609","01:14:10,830","that I wanted to build our son's future
on the ashes of that fine city."
1491,"01:14:13,240","01:14:16,540","But it was at that moment
that your mother realized"
1492,"01:14:18,704","01:14:21,048",that the life of a conquering warlord
1493,"01:14:24,168","01:14:25,886",was not the life she wanted
1494,"01:14:29,882","01:14:31,680",for you.
1495,"01:14:34,887","01:14:36,810",I could've changed.
1496,"01:15:01,747","01:15:03,875",But I didn't.
1497,"01:15:13,884","01:15:16,137","And before I knew it,"
1498,"01:15:19,598","01:15:21,771",she was gone
1499,"01:15:23,602","01:15:26,355",and you were gone.
1500,"01:15:42,621","01:15:45,966","La-Loyd, your mom was the best."
1501,"01:15:47,043","01:15:49,421",She expected the best of me
1502,"01:15:50,212","01:15:52,385",and only ever wanted the best for you.
1503,"01:15:58,804","01:16:01,307",I never should have let you go.
1504,"01:16:04,101","01:16:07,651","Lloyd! We found
the Ultimate Ultimate Weapon!"
1505,"01:16:07,897","01:16:09,069","Here, in the bedroom!"
1506,"01:16:09,231","01:16:10,278",We think it's in that box.
1507,"01:16:10,441","01:16:11,488","Open it, open it, open it!"
1508,"01:16:13,652","01:16:15,404",Whoa!
1509,"01:16:15,571","01:16:17,323",What a bunch of junk.
1510,"01:16:17,490","01:16:19,492",Maybe there's something important under it.
1511,"01:16:20,326","01:16:22,420","This is the Ultimate
Ultimate Disappointment."
1512,"01:16:22,578","01:16:23,830","- Correct.
- No. Wait."
1513,"01:16:24,413","01:16:26,962","There's a piece
for each of our elements."
1514,"01:16:27,124","01:16:28,341",Fire.
1515,"01:16:29,960","01:16:31,633",Whoa!
1516,"01:16:32,630","01:16:34,223",And earth.
1517,"01:16:34,340","01:16:36,138",This rocks!
1518,"01:16:36,300","01:16:40,350","- And water.
- H-2, oh yeah!"
1519,"01:16:40,513","01:16:41,639",And ice.
1520,"01:16:41,806","01:16:43,103",Cool.
1521,"01:16:43,682","01:16:44,683",And lightning.
1522,"01:16:47,353","01:16:50,823",And I'm... Green.
1523,"01:16:51,690","01:16:54,819",But I'm so happy for you guys.
1524,"01:16:55,820","01:16:57,117",Yay.
1525,"01:16:58,864","01:17:02,539","You know, La-Loyd,
after spending all this time with you,"
1526,"01:17:02,701","01:17:05,124","seeing the amazing ninja warrior
you've become..."
1527,"01:17:05,287","01:17:06,288",Yeah?
1528,"01:17:06,497","01:17:09,967","You know, I've realized that
we don't need to fight each other"
1529,"01:17:10,668","01:17:13,467","- when we can fight alongside each other.
- Really?"
1530,"01:17:13,796","01:17:14,797",Yeah.
1531,"01:17:15,714","01:17:19,719","La-Loyd, will you go back
to NINJAGO with me,"
1532,"01:17:19,885","01:17:21,057",as father...
1533,"01:17:22,346","01:17:24,724",...and General Number One?
1534,"01:17:25,391","01:17:26,893","Wait, what?"
1535,"01:17:27,601","01:17:29,478",Your General Number One?
1536,"01:17:29,645","01:17:30,817",Exactly!
1537,"01:17:31,522","01:17:34,696","But you just said
how you regretted letting me go."
1538,"01:17:34,942","01:17:37,536","Because you'd make
the perfect General Number One."
1539,"01:17:37,695","01:17:39,538","We're an amazing team, La-Loyd."
1540,"01:17:39,989","01:17:42,492","You, me, the Ultimate Ultimate Weapon."
1541,"01:17:42,658","01:17:44,285",We'd be unstoppable.
1542,"01:17:44,451","01:17:48,046","No. I don't wanna be
your General Number One."
1543,"01:17:48,205","01:17:51,880","But just imagine it.
We can rule NINJAGO, together."
1544,"01:17:52,042","01:17:53,544","Come with me, La-Loyd."
1545,"01:17:53,711","01:17:56,385","We have so much lost time
to make up for!"
1546,"01:17:56,547","01:17:59,471","And since I'll no longer be attacking
the city, no one will hate you anymore."
1547,"01:17:59,633","01:18:01,055","And I'll never forget
your birthday again,"
1548,"01:18:01,218","01:18:03,516","because we'll celebrate
your birthday every day!"
1549,"01:18:03,721","01:18:05,974","And think of all the things
I could teach you."
1550,"01:18:06,140","01:18:09,565","Tie a tie, ride a bike, conquer a city."
1551,"01:18:09,727","01:18:13,072","And if we leave now, we can unleash
the Ultimate Ultimate Weapon on Meowthra"
1552,"01:18:13,230","01:18:15,232",and conquer NINJAGO together. Come on!
1553,"01:18:15,399","01:18:18,027","- Dad, please don't.
- Huh?"
1554,"01:18:18,319","01:18:21,072","Come back to NINJAGO with me
and save the city."
1555,"01:18:21,238","01:18:22,740","- What?
- You'll be a hero."
1556,"01:18:22,907","01:18:26,411","But that's not who I am, La-Loyd.
People would never see me as a hero."
1557,"01:18:26,577","01:18:29,251",But it doesn't have to be this way.
1558,"01:18:29,747","01:18:32,216",This is your chance to make a change.
1559,"01:18:32,374","01:18:35,719","I didn't want it to be this way either,
but here we are."
1560,"01:18:35,878","01:18:38,597","Dad, please, don't go."
1561,"01:18:38,756","01:18:40,884","If I couldn't change then,"
1562,"01:18:41,050","01:18:43,553",what makes you think I could change now?
1563,"01:18:43,928","01:18:45,851","- No,no.
- Stop!"
1564,"01:18:46,013","01:18:47,105","- Back off!
- No way!"
1565,"01:18:48,057","01:18:49,058","Hey, that's my sister!"
1566,"01:18:49,850","01:18:52,103","- Get off my face!
- Barn!"
1567,"01:18:52,269","01:18:53,737","- I got it!
- Give that back!"
1568,"01:18:55,439","01:18:57,692",I can help you. We can do it together.
1569,"01:18:57,858","01:19:00,031","If you just give me the box,
we can talk about it."
1570,"01:19:00,236","01:19:01,954",I can't. You'll just leave.
1571,"01:19:03,072","01:19:04,540","- I got it!
- Look out!"
1572,"01:19:04,698","01:19:06,917","- Cole!
- Gotcha! Nice try. Zane!"
1573,"01:19:07,076","01:19:09,249",We're like the Harlem Globetrotters.
1574,"01:19:10,246","01:19:11,293",Hey!
1575,"01:19:11,455","01:19:12,456","- Over here!
- Get outta my way."
1576,"01:19:12,623","01:19:13,624","Lloyd, catch it!"
1577,"01:19:13,791","01:19:15,634","- Run, Lloyd! Run!
- I got it!"
1578,"01:19:15,793","01:19:17,136",I got it!
1579,"01:19:17,294","01:19:18,591",Predictable but regrettable.
1580,"01:19:18,754","01:19:19,801",Bummer.
1581,"01:19:19,964","01:19:21,932","Oh, La-Loyd."
1582,"01:19:23,801","01:19:24,927",Dad.
1583,"01:19:27,054","01:19:28,772",I should have taught you how to catch.
1584,"01:19:28,931","01:19:30,729",No!
1585,"01:19:43,279","01:19:45,156","So long, La-Loyd."
1586,"01:19:55,833","01:19:58,256","Get outta the way!
This whole thing is coming down!"
1587,"01:19:58,419","01:20:00,342",We don't have those pieces.
1588,"01:20:00,504","01:20:03,257","- Yeah, and we don't even have our mechs.
- We're doomed!"
1589,"01:20:03,424","01:20:05,017","- Oh, no! We're gonna die.
- What do we do?"
1590,"01:20:05,175","01:20:09,021",Our chances of survival are 0.00...
1591,"01:20:09,346","01:20:12,691","Stay on the right path
to find your inner peace."
1592,"01:20:14,601","01:20:16,695",Did he say inner peace?
1593,"01:20:19,690","01:20:22,034",The power is inside you.
1594,"01:20:22,359","01:20:26,865",The power is inside you.
1595,"01:20:34,038","01:20:35,540",Inner peace?
1596,"01:20:35,706","01:20:37,549",Find your inner peace.
1597,"01:20:38,042","01:20:39,544",Inner peace! Inner piece!
1598,"01:20:39,710","01:20:42,054","Guys, we don't need those pieces."
1599,"01:20:42,212","01:20:45,807","The Ultimate Ultimate Weapon
is inside of you."
1600,"01:20:45,966","01:20:48,845","- What?
- Yes, you have the power."
1601,"01:20:49,011","01:20:50,854",Look within.
1602,"01:20:51,055","01:20:53,899","Harness what you already have
inside and let it out."
1603,"01:20:54,058","01:20:56,060",I believe in each of you.
1604,"01:20:56,685","01:20:59,063","Nya, you can create water."
1605,"01:20:59,646","01:21:01,865","Kai, you can make fire."
1606,"01:21:02,024","01:21:03,697",Okay. All right. I can make a fire.
1607,"01:21:03,859","01:21:06,738",The power is inside of all of you.
1608,"01:21:06,904","01:21:08,827","Now, calm your mind. Concentrate."
1609,"01:21:08,989","01:21:11,242",Build up your powers.
1610,"01:21:11,408","01:21:15,254","Just think about
earth, fire, water, ice."
1611,"01:21:15,412","01:21:18,256","And you, Jay, lightning, baby. Do it!"
1612,"01:21:18,415","01:21:19,883",Jay. you got the power!
1613,"01:21:20,042","01:21:22,261","Say, ""I've got the power!"""
1614,"01:21:22,419","01:21:24,672",I've got the power!
1615,"01:21:29,426","01:21:31,099",I've got the power.
1616,"01:21:32,596","01:21:34,769","Good work, Cole. Go, go, go!"
1617,"01:21:36,392","01:21:37,393",I've got the power.
1618,"01:21:37,559","01:21:39,607","I, too, have the power."
1619,"01:21:40,854","01:21:41,855","Here we go. Come on, hurry up."
1620,"01:21:43,857","01:21:44,858",What now?
1621,"01:21:45,025","01:21:46,277","- Kai, your turn.
- Got it."
1622,"01:21:46,443","01:21:47,615",I've got the power!
1623,"01:21:49,780","01:21:51,532",I think I made it worse!
1624,"01:21:52,866","01:21:53,958","Jump, Lloyd. Jump."
1625,"01:21:54,118","01:21:55,461",Master Wu?
1626,"01:21:56,203","01:21:58,376","Guys, I can hear the dead,"
1627,"01:21:58,539","01:22:02,385",and Master Wu says to jump!
1628,"01:22:09,007","01:22:10,384","Great jump, students."
1629,"01:22:11,135","01:22:12,307",Master Wu!
1630,"01:22:12,469","01:22:13,470",You're alive!
1631,"01:22:13,637","01:22:15,810",Of course. I'm a ninja master
1632,"01:22:15,973","01:22:19,147","who lives life on the edge
and cheats death at every turn."
1633,"01:22:19,309","01:22:21,152","- Wow.
- Really?"
1634,"01:22:21,311","01:22:23,063",No. I thought being dead
1635,"01:22:23,230","01:22:25,779","would make you listen to me more.
And I was right."
1636,"01:22:25,941","01:22:28,114","Master Wu, we found our elemental powers."
1637,"01:22:28,277","01:22:30,325","All because Lloyd wouldn't
give up on our training."
1638,"01:22:30,487","01:22:31,488",Lloyd saved us.
1639,"01:22:31,655","01:22:34,659","He also decoded
your needlessly cryptic metaphors."
1640,"01:22:34,825","01:22:36,998","Lloyd, I'm so proud of you."
1641,"01:22:37,161","01:22:39,129",You helped your friends be great.
1642,"01:22:39,288","01:22:42,633",And that makes you truly a ninja master.
1643,"01:22:42,833","01:22:46,007","Now, let's go save the city
from the giant kitty."
1644,"01:22:46,628","01:22:48,596",I second that!
1645,"01:22:50,674","01:22:52,847",This cat is destroying everything!
1646,"01:22:53,010","01:22:54,853",Where are the Ninjas when we need them?
1647,"01:22:55,012","01:22:56,764",We have to evacuate!
1648,"01:22:58,515","01:22:59,516",Run! Run!
1649,"01:22:59,683","01:23:01,435","Hey, NINJAGO,"
1650,"01:23:01,602","01:23:03,104",Garmadon's back!
1651,"01:23:03,645","01:23:06,364","Generals, stop anyone
that gets in my way."
1652,"01:23:06,523","01:23:07,991","Yes, sir."
1653,"01:23:09,985","01:23:12,864","Whoa! It's the Destiny's Bounty.
I've always wanted to shoot at it."
1654,"01:23:13,030","01:23:14,077",Attack!
1655,"01:23:14,198","01:23:15,871","Alpha team, on it."
1656,"01:23:17,201","01:23:19,329",We have company. Hold on tight.
1657,"01:23:23,916","01:23:25,884","Hey, where'd they go?"
1658,"01:23:26,502","01:23:28,129","All right, Ninjas, follow me."
1659,"01:23:31,840","01:23:32,841","Ninja, go!"
1660,"01:23:33,550","01:23:34,893","- Yeah!
- Yeah!"
1661,"01:23:36,845","01:23:39,473","Nya, we need to get to Garmadon
and that cat fast."
1662,"01:23:39,640","01:23:40,812",You got it.
1663,"01:23:43,894","01:23:45,487","All right, you beast."
1664,"01:23:45,646","01:23:49,571","Get ready to feel the wrath
of the Ultimate Ultimate Weapon."
1665,"01:23:50,734","01:23:52,077",Here they come.
1666,"01:23:52,236","01:23:54,580","- Come on! Let's go!
- Follow Nya."
1667,"01:24:00,661","01:24:02,083",Take that.
1668,"01:24:03,247","01:24:04,544",What?
1669,"01:24:08,544","01:24:10,342","- Zane, freeze these guys out.
- Copy."
1670,"01:24:12,548","01:24:14,095","Kai, make a smoke screen."
1671,"01:24:14,258","01:24:16,602","Yeah, baby! Fuego!"
1672,"01:24:18,887","01:24:19,888",Where'd they go?
1673,"01:24:20,055","01:24:21,557",I can't see them anywhere.
1674,"01:24:22,099","01:24:24,898","Okay. Well, how about this?"
1675,"01:24:25,936","01:24:27,108",These things aren't working.
1676,"01:24:27,271","01:24:29,774","- Jay, now's your chance, buddy.
- Roger that."
1677,"01:24:39,366","01:24:40,583",Let's rock!
1678,"01:24:46,456","01:24:48,424","Hey, cat, back off!"
1679,"01:24:48,584","01:24:51,053","I'm Garmadon, baby.
I'm the greatest warlord of all..."
1680,"01:24:52,462","01:24:53,714",Somebody help me!
1681,"01:24:53,880","01:24:55,553","- Dad?
- Please!"
1682,"01:24:57,134","01:24:58,636","Go, ninjas, go!"
1683,"01:24:58,802","01:24:59,803",Hip hip hooray!
1684,"01:24:59,970","01:25:01,472",The cat ate Garmadon!
1685,"01:25:01,638","01:25:03,436","Now all we have to do
is take out the cat"
1686,"01:25:03,599","01:25:04,725",and NINJAGO is saved.
1687,"01:25:04,933","01:25:06,810","- Get him!
- Take out that monster!"
1688,"01:25:06,977","01:25:09,400","Blast that cat
with your awesome hand powers."
1689,"01:25:09,563","01:25:13,568",La-Loyd! Please help me!
1690,"01:25:13,734","01:25:16,112","Oh, I can use my fire.
But is that too much?"
1691,"01:25:16,278","01:25:19,157","Or I could blast him with my water.
Cats hate water."
1692,"01:25:19,906","01:25:21,408","You were right, Master Wu."
1693,"01:25:23,285","01:25:27,131","I need to walk the path that only
the son of Garmadon can walk."
1694,"01:25:32,169","01:25:33,842","Oh, my gosh!"
1695,"01:25:34,004","01:25:37,178",The Green Ninja is Lloyd Garmadon?
1696,"01:25:37,341","01:25:38,342",Lloyd.
1697,"01:25:38,508","01:25:42,183","All we have to do is scare off
Meowthra and we've won."
1698,"01:25:42,846","01:25:44,689","- No.
- What?"
1699,"01:25:44,848","01:25:45,974","Uh, Lloyd,"
1700,"01:25:46,141","01:25:48,018",where are you going?
1701,"01:25:48,769","01:25:50,112",Lloyd? Come back.
1702,"01:25:53,357","01:25:55,951","Here, kitty, kitty, kitty."
1703,"01:26:01,365","01:26:03,117","Yeah, come here."
1704,"01:26:03,283","01:26:04,284","Lloyd, no!"
1705,"01:26:04,451","01:26:06,829",It's okay. He's got this.
1706,"01:26:06,995","01:26:09,123",That's a good kitty.
1707,"01:26:09,873","01:26:13,798","You're okay. Yeah, you're okay."
1708,"01:26:19,299","01:26:22,519","Yeah. Yeah, that's a good kitty."
1709,"01:26:22,678","01:26:25,682","What a sweet, sweet kitty."
1710,"01:26:27,224","01:26:30,899",Everything's gonna be just fine.
1711,"01:26:31,812","01:26:34,691",Hey. I know it.
1712,"01:26:34,856","01:26:37,359","I know it. You don't mean
to destroy everything."
1713,"01:26:40,570","01:26:43,744","When... When people look at you,"
1714,"01:26:44,658","01:26:46,752",they see a monster.
1715,"01:26:49,705","01:26:52,424",But I know that
1716,"01:26:52,582","01:26:56,553",you just feel scared and alone.
1717,"01:26:59,589","01:27:02,012",I know how that feels.
1718,"01:27:04,594","01:27:06,346",To be judged unfairly.
1719,"01:27:15,313","01:27:16,690","So, um..."
1720,"01:27:17,441","01:27:20,536",I just wanna say that I forgive you.
1721,"01:27:23,447","01:27:24,699",And...
1722,"01:27:29,953","01:27:31,455",I'm sorry.
1723,"01:27:33,248","01:27:36,627","When I said
""I wish you weren't my father,"""
1724,"01:27:38,086","01:27:41,056",I didn't really mean it.
1725,"01:27:43,550","01:27:46,099","What I should've said is,"
1726,"01:27:47,137","01:27:51,768",I wish we didn't fight all of the time.
1727,"01:27:53,560","01:27:58,157","I wish I could've spent
more time with you."
1728,"01:27:58,648","01:28:02,653","And that you could've seen
everything I've been through,"
1729,"01:28:03,320","01:28:05,823",but you weren't there.
1730,"01:28:05,989","01:28:08,492",I wish we could get that time back.
1731,"01:28:12,120","01:28:15,670",I need my dad. I just need my dad.
1732,"01:28:28,678","01:28:29,679","- Oh! Oh, whoa.
- Dad!"
1733,"01:28:30,472","01:28:32,691","- Are you okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine."
1734,"01:28:32,849","01:28:34,021",You're alive!
1735,"01:28:35,143","01:28:36,144",Son?
1736,"01:28:36,311","01:28:37,437",Yeah?
1737,"01:28:37,604","01:28:41,325",Did you mean all that stuff you said?
1738,"01:28:42,150","01:28:43,493",To the cat?
1739,"01:28:44,236","01:28:45,704",Every word.
1740,"01:28:46,279","01:28:48,998","Well, I know for a fact"
1741,"01:28:49,157","01:28:52,331",that the cat feels exactly the same way.
1742,"01:28:53,870","01:28:57,044",Dad? Are you crying?
1743,"01:28:57,833","01:28:59,050",No!
1744,"01:28:59,209","01:29:03,180","It's just that
I'm kind of allergic to cats."
1745,"01:29:08,218","01:29:09,561","- Lloyd!
- Mom!"
1746,"01:29:09,719","01:29:11,972","Let me, let me look at you.
Let me look at you. Are you hurt?"
1747,"01:29:12,138","01:29:13,560",Let me see your fingers and toes.
1748,"01:29:13,723","01:29:16,727","Okay. You still don't have
fingers and toes. That's good."
1749,"01:29:16,893","01:29:18,486","- Is everything okay?
- I'm fine. I'm good."
1750,"01:29:18,645","01:29:20,397","Lloyd, I was so worried about you."
1751,"01:29:20,564","01:29:21,907","Mom, wait!"
1752,"01:29:23,066","01:29:24,238",I'm sorry.
1753,"01:29:24,401","01:29:27,075","It's okay. I'm just so happy
you're all right."
1754,"01:29:27,237","01:29:30,161","No. Mom, I'm really sorry."
1755,"01:29:30,866","01:29:32,709",I took you for granted.
1756,"01:29:33,577","01:29:35,750",All you ever did was support me.
1757,"01:29:36,496","01:29:38,089",The real me.
1758,"01:29:38,248","01:29:41,502",The person I am on the inside.
1759,"01:29:41,835","01:29:42,882",Oh.
1760,"01:29:43,086","01:29:44,087","I'm really sorry, Mom."
1761,"01:29:44,546","01:29:46,548",I love you so much.
1762,"01:29:46,715","01:29:48,262","I love you, too."
1763,"01:29:49,593","01:29:51,266",Bring it in. Let's hug this out.
1764,"01:29:51,428","01:29:52,896",Okay. That's cool.
1765,"01:29:53,138","01:29:56,483","Uh... I found two people
to hug me over here."
1766,"01:29:57,726","01:30:02,277","Uncle Wu, I know why you wanted
me to be the Green Ninja."
1767,"01:30:02,439","01:30:04,032","Oh, you do?"
1768,"01:30:04,190","01:30:05,362",Yeah.
1769,"01:30:06,276","01:30:08,449",Green is the color of life.
1770,"01:30:09,779","01:30:12,077","It flows through all living things,"
1771,"01:30:12,949","01:30:14,292",connecting them all.
1772,"01:30:15,243","01:30:17,120",The way I connect the Ninjas.
1773,"01:30:21,791","01:30:22,792",Hi!
1774,"01:30:25,879","01:30:29,133","Or the way I connect my family,"
1775,"01:30:29,966","01:30:32,810",whether we're together or not.
1776,"01:30:33,386","01:30:36,310","Some powers are ones you cannot see,"
1777,"01:30:36,473","01:30:40,649","but those are the most
important powers of all."
1778,"01:30:43,772","01:30:45,399",Lloyd was a hero.
1779,"01:30:45,565","01:30:46,612",Who are you talking to?
1780,"01:30:46,775","01:30:49,779","He saved Garmadon
and he saved his family."
1781,"01:30:49,945","01:30:50,992",We're standing right here.
1782,"01:30:51,154","01:30:52,656",And the whole city of NINJAGO.
1783,"01:30:52,822","01:30:53,823",Where are you going?
1784,"01:30:53,990","01:30:55,663",They even made Meowthra the mascot.
1785,"01:30:55,825","01:30:57,827",She's so fluffy! I love her.
1786,"01:30:57,994","01:30:59,462","Wu, come back!"
1787,"01:30:59,621","01:31:01,623",Koko and Nya opened a school
1788,"01:31:01,790","01:31:04,964",to teach former shark generals life skills.
1789,"01:31:05,627","01:31:08,801","And Garmadon taught Lloyd
something very important."
1790,"01:31:08,964","01:31:10,511","Hey, catch!"
1791,"01:31:12,092","01:31:13,184",Whoa.
1792,"01:31:14,344","01:31:16,472",And Lloyd taught everyone
1793,"01:31:16,638","01:31:18,515","that even if you're different,"
1794,"01:31:18,682","01:31:21,982","- you can still do great things.
- Wow."
1795,"01:31:22,519","01:31:24,362",So does that mean I'm a ninja now?
1796,"01:31:24,938","01:31:26,030",No.
1797,"01:31:26,189","01:31:28,191",All you did was listen to a story.
1798,"01:31:28,358","01:31:29,860",Doesn't make you a martial artist.
1799,"01:31:30,026","01:31:31,528",Or does it?
1800,"01:31:35,824","01:31:37,292","Okay, okay, Okay."
1801,"01:31:38,368","01:31:40,996","Listen, to be a master,"
1802,"01:31:41,162","01:31:44,211","it takes patience, hard work,"
1803,"01:31:44,374","01:31:46,718","courage, and..."
1804,"01:31:50,380","01:31:51,552",Wow.
1805,"01:31:55,051","01:31:56,177",Good.
1806,"01:31:58,680","01:32:00,478",Your training begins at dawn.
1807,"01:32:00,724","01:32:01,771",Whoa.
1808,"01:32:02,225","01:32:03,272",Whoa.
1809,"01:32:03,893","01:32:05,520",Can we bring the cat?
1810,"01:32:05,687","01:32:06,813",No.
1811,"01:32:16,823","01:32:20,418","Okay, kids. There's one last thing
I have to teach you ninjas."
1812,"01:32:20,577","01:32:22,875",Get on your feet. You ready?
1813,"01:32:23,038","01:32:25,882",Here comes the Dance of Doom.
1814,"01:35:19,672","01:35:20,764",A mark.
1815,"01:35:20,924","01:35:22,016",Jackie Chan!
1816,"01:35:22,175","01:35:23,267",B mark.
