Are you serious right now?"
970,"00:55:16,896","00:55:19,315",Well! Maybe you can believe this.

this morning."
985,"00:55:56,394","00:55:57,812","I believe we did, yeah."
986,"00:56:00,190","00:56:03,693","SpongeBob, the coin was just a symbol."
987,"00:56:03,777","00:56:05,820","The courage you seek is inside you,"
988,"00:56:05,904","00:56:07,113",not in the coin.

in your hour of need."
990,"00:56:09,657","00:56:12,243",But isn't this my hour of need?
991,"00:56:12,327","00:56:14,871","Oh, no."
992,"00:56:14,954","00:56:17,207",It gets way worse.

- Dude said way worse."
995,"00:56:23,046","00:56:26,841",Prepare the prisoners.
996,"00:56:26,925","00:56:28,259","Oh, that couldn't be for us."
997,"00:56:28,343","00:56:31,304","It's your big moment to fry…

you underwater critters."
1089,"01:01:51,290","01:01:53,000",We all breathe air on the surface.
1090,"01:01:53,584","01:01:55,878",It's just our way of synthesizing oxygen.
1091,"01:01:55,962","01:01:57,630",Same as you do with water.
1092,"01:01:58,339","01:02:01,342",Whoa. Are you a scientist?
1093,"01:02:01,426","01:02:03,886","Naw, I'm just a squirrel."
1094,"01:02:03,970","01:02:05,930",I can't be a scientist.
1095,"01:02:06,013","01:02:08,266",Even though it's kind of my dream.

1097,"01:02:10,435","01:02:12,645",I bet you can do anything.

1102,"01:02:27,326","01:02:29,162",I'd be just as likely to live down here

1111,"01:02:55,938","01:02:57,857","And that's why, in my eyes…"
1112,"01:02:58,691","01:03:01,194",SpongeBob is no criminal.
1113,"01:03:01,277","01:03:03,529",He's the best little fella

nothing I can do about it."""

and SpongeBob is proof of it!"
1124,"01:03:41,943","01:03:43,861",All he's guilty of
1125,"01:03:43,945","01:03:48,699","is having the fortitude
to try and rescue a friend."
1126,"01:03:51,118","01:03:52,203",How do I know?
1127,"01:03:52,286","01:03:55,456","Oh, I was just a lonely bump on a log"
1128,"01:03:55,540","01:03:57,166",when I first met him.

what's your name?"
1132,"01:04:15,309","01:04:18,312",I'm Pa-Pa-Patrick.
1133,"01:04:20,439","01:04:22,817","Why are you crying, Pa-Pa-Patrick?"
1134,"01:04:22,900","01:04:25,111",I'm homesick.
1135,"01:04:26,571","01:04:29,031","Well, that's a pretty good reason."
1136,"01:04:29,699","01:04:33,119",Maybe all you need is a friend.
1137,"01:04:33,202","01:04:35,955",I don't have any friends!
1138,"01:04:36,038","01:04:38,499","- Well, you've got one now.
- Really?"
1139,"01:04:39,542","01:04:41,669","- Who is it?
- It's me!"
1140,"01:04:41,752","01:04:45,089","- Do you mean it?
- Of course. Come on!"

that much today, Your Honor."
1144,"01:05:03,900","01:05:05,610","My heart, buddy."
1145,"01:05:09,196","01:05:13,075",I don't like SpongeBob.
1146,"01:05:13,159","01:05:16,412","In fact, I revile him."

1148,"01:05:20,499","01:05:25,504","Anyway, I, too, met this nabob

1149,"01:05:25,588","01:05:27,673",I remember it like it was yesterday.
1150,"01:05:27,757","01:05:29,550",It was my big night.
1151,"01:05:29,634","01:05:32,470",The Annual Camp Coral Talent Show.
1152,"01:05:35,640","01:05:38,351","And first prize was the coveted
Campy Award."
1153,"01:05:38,434","01:05:40,019","Thank you, Larry."
1154,"01:05:40,102","01:05:42,229","Remember, people, don't forget to vote."
1155,"01:05:47,652","01:05:49,528","As far as I was concerned,"
1156,"01:05:49,612","01:05:52,031",the trophy was as good as mine.
1157,"01:05:52,114","01:05:54,241","- Hey, Squidward...
- Bup, bup, bup, bup."
1158,"01:05:54,325","01:05:57,036",Quiet. I'm in pregame right now.
1159,"01:05:58,955","01:06:00,748",I've got an award to win.

1163,"01:06:14,553","01:06:17,473",The Campy is mine.
1164,"01:06:22,728","01:06:24,355",I bathed the audience
1165,"01:06:24,438","01:06:27,525","with the sounds of my
heavenly clarinet playing."
1166,"01:06:39,829","01:06:42,456","Thank you, Squidward. Just lovely."
1167,"01:06:42,540","01:06:44,083","Thank you, thank you."
1168,"01:06:47,086","01:06:49,296",And the Campy goes to…
1169,"01:06:49,463","01:06:50,649",I'll take that.
1170,"01:06:50,673","01:06:52,758","- …SpongeBob and Patrick!
- Huh?"
1171,"01:06:52,925","01:06:56,929",No! No! No!
1172,"01:06:58,264","01:07:00,057",This isn't happening!
1173,"01:07:00,141","01:07:02,435",No! Mommy!
1174,"01:07:02,518","01:07:04,520",I was robbed.
1175,"01:07:04,603","01:07:07,815",And never to play the clarinet again.
1176,"01:07:10,568","01:07:13,112",No…
1177,"01:07:20,077","01:07:22,788","- Squidward!
- Go away!"
1178,"01:07:24,957","01:07:26,584","Patrick and I were, um,"
1179,"01:07:26,667","01:07:29,378","talking to one of the counselors
and guess what?"
1180,"01:07:29,462","01:07:33,215","There was a big mistake and you
actually won the Campy Award!"
1181,"01:07:33,299","01:07:34,842",That's right. Yup.
1182,"01:07:35,593","01:07:38,596","- I… I did?
- In a landslide."
1183,"01:07:38,679","01:07:40,431",Hmm.
1184,"01:07:40,514","01:07:42,975","So weird they would've
miscounted like that."
1185,"01:07:43,059","01:07:45,603","- But I guess it's possible...
- Yay!"
1186,"01:07:45,686","01:07:48,981","- Nice work, Squidward.
- No one deserves it more."
1187,"01:07:49,065","01:07:50,357",Wow.
1188,"01:07:50,441","01:07:52,860",And don't ever stop playing this.
1189,"01:07:52,943","01:07:54,403",My clarinet.
1190,"01:07:54,487","01:07:56,947",Look at me. I really did it!
1191,"01:07:57,031","01:07:58,783",Yay!
1192,"01:07:59,700","01:08:03,996","Which is why, even though
I can't stand SpongeBob…"
1193,"01:08:04,080","01:08:07,249","but at the same time, well…"
1194,"01:08:07,333","01:08:08,375",I love him.
1195,"01:08:08,459","01:08:09,668",I love him
1196,"01:08:09,752","01:08:11,253","- and I hate him.
- Oh."
1197,"01:08:11,337","01:08:13,631","He's like ice cream with salt on it,"
1198,"01:08:13,714","01:08:16,759",because he's sweet and super annoying.
1199,"01:08:16,842","01:08:18,302",He's nice and
1200,"01:08:18,385","01:08:20,721",nails-on-chalkboard annoying!
1201,"01:08:20,805","01:08:23,724","Okay, fine, he's mostly
super freaking annoying."
1202,"01:08:23,808","01:08:27,269","But, this little nattering noodge…"
1203,"01:08:28,312","01:08:29,563",is my friend.
1204,"01:08:30,439","01:08:32,108",And he doesn't deserve to die.
1205,"01:08:40,199","01:08:43,577","I'll be saying my piece now,
if it be pleasing the court."
1206,"01:08:43,661","01:08:46,789",I suppose I could stand up here
1207,"01:08:46,872","01:08:49,875","and tell you how
SpongeBob changed me life."
1208,"01:08:49,959","01:08:51,544","But, I won't."
1209,"01:08:52,461","01:08:54,922","I might even speak
about how he inspired me"
1210,"01:08:55,005","01:08:59,385","when I was just a small-time vendor
with a broken-down luncheonette."
1211,"01:08:59,468","01:09:01,679",But I won't.
1212,"01:09:01,762","01:09:04,348","Heck, I'd probably mention
how he encouraged me"
1213,"01:09:04,431","01:09:06,100",to start up me own restaurant.
1214,"01:09:06,183","01:09:08,063","You should open up
your own restaurant, someday."
1215,"01:09:08,435","01:09:12,648","The Krusty Krab, made famous
by me delicious Krabby Patties!"
1216,"01:09:12,815","01:09:15,192","Two-for-one Wednesdays,
by the way. Pass these around."
1217,"01:09:15,734","01:09:17,653","But, I won't."
1218,"01:09:17,820","01:09:21,574","Nay, you'll hear none such praise from me."
1219,"01:09:21,740","01:09:24,243",Because it wouldn't do him full justice.
1220,"01:09:24,410","01:09:28,164","It wouldn't begin to describe
the size of the lad's heart."
1221,"01:09:28,664","01:09:31,458",Which is huge.
1222,"01:09:35,421","01:09:38,883","And he puts that heart
into everything he does."
1223,"01:09:39,049","01:09:40,050",The cooking…
1224,"01:09:40,217","01:09:42,011","- Order up!
- …cleaning…"
1225,"01:09:42,595","01:09:45,055","…serving up the delicious
Krabby Patties."
1226,"01:09:45,222","01:09:47,057",But that's the funny thing.
1227,"01:09:47,725","01:09:50,728","I used to think
me secret Krabby Patty formula"
1228,"01:09:50,895","01:09:53,272",was also the secret to me success.
1229,"01:09:53,439","01:09:56,442","We serve breakfast till 11,
by the way, 12 on weekends."
1230,"01:09:56,609","01:10:00,070","It wasn't until SpongeBob
came to work for me"
1231,"01:10:00,237","01:10:02,573",that I realized the formula
1232,"01:10:02,740","01:10:05,075",is more than just a list of ingredients
1233,"01:10:05,159","01:10:06,911",and flavor-capturing methods.
1234,"01:10:07,077","01:10:10,372","It's more than a jealously
guarded recipe."
1235,"01:10:11,081","01:10:13,375",The real secret formula

- Hooray!"
1340,"01:16:14,486","01:16:16,363",On one condition.
1341,"01:16:16,863","01:16:19,491",SpongeBob will return my snail to me
1342,"01:16:19,658","01:16:21,952",without any more shilly-shally.
1343,"01:16:22,035","01:16:23,412","Wait, what?"
1344,"01:16:23,495","01:16:26,498","Just hand over the snail
and you can all go free."
1345,"01:16:29,251","01:16:31,962",But… I… I…
1346,"01:16:32,129","01:16:33,630",SpongeBob.
1347,"01:16:34,256","01:16:36,300",Sage? Is that you?
1348,"01:16:36,466","01:16:37,467",Hello.
1349,"01:16:37,634","01:16:39,136",Sage! Hi!
1350,"01:16:39,303","01:16:40,304",Remember…
1351,"01:16:40,470","01:16:42,306","The courage you seek
is inside you."
1352,"01:16:42,472","01:16:45,183","And it will come to you
in your hour of need."
1353,"01:16:47,269","01:16:49,771",The courage is inside me.
1354,"01:16:51,440","01:16:53,609",The courage is inside me!
1355,"01:16:55,110","01:16:57,070","Mr. Poseidon, no."
1356,"01:16:57,237","01:16:59,031","I'm sorry, but I won't do it."
1357,"01:17:01,074","01:17:01,908",What?
1358,"01:17:01,992","01:17:04,494","I love Gary too much,
and he loves me."
1359,"01:17:04,953","01:17:07,789","If we didn't have each other,
we'd be so sad. Well…"
1360,"01:17:07,956","01:17:10,083","It wouldn't really matter
what you'd do to us."
1361,"01:17:11,627","01:17:15,213","And look. Today, thanks to these
amazing friends,"
1362,"01:17:15,297","01:17:18,800","my heart feels twice as big
a s it ever did."
1363,"01:17:19,509","01:17:21,720",Especially after what they risked for me:
1364,"01:17:21,887","01:17:24,973","Flouting the law and defying
the mighty king of the sea."
1365,"01:17:26,058","01:17:27,809",Defying? Really?
1366,"01:17:27,893","01:17:30,354",I wouldn't say defying the king.
1367,"01:17:30,437","01:17:32,648",Humiliating you in front of your subjects.
1368,"01:17:32,731","01:17:34,816","- Do go on.
- More like admiring."
1369,"01:17:34,900","01:17:36,401",And totally agreeing with!
1370,"01:17:36,485","01:17:38,195",I just came to see Kelpy G.
1371,"01:17:38,278","01:17:40,197",And they did it all for me.
1372,"01:17:40,280","01:17:43,283","I'm sure you'd understand
if you had friends like these."
1373,"01:17:43,367","01:17:46,828","Friends like these?
Wait, what?"
1374,"01:17:47,287","01:17:48,872",Friends like these?
1375,"01:17:49,039","01:17:51,792","Of course I have
friends like these."
1376,"01:17:51,875","01:17:53,460",I have all kinds of friends!
1377,"01:17:53,543","01:17:56,505","I have buddies, I have besties."
1378,"01:17:56,672","01:17:59,883","I have home-slices, palsy-walsies."
1379,"01:18:00,050","01:18:01,468",It's infinite!
1380,"01:18:01,551","01:18:03,512",Chancellor! Give us an exact number.
1381,"01:18:03,595","01:18:05,097","The friend count, if you will."
1382,"01:18:05,180","01:18:08,600","Uh, okay,
according to your latest polling data,"
1383,"01:18:08,975","01:18:11,103",we should get more polling data.
1384,"01:18:11,186","01:18:12,187",What? Give me that.
1385,"01:18:12,270","01:18:13,814",Huh?
1386,"01:18:13,897","01:18:15,232",What about my adoring fans?
1387,"01:18:16,608","01:18:18,860","- Nope.
- My elite palace guards?"
1388,"01:18:18,944","01:18:20,046",Mm-mm.
1389,"01:18:20,070","01:18:22,489","- What about my personal trainer?
- Mmm… Mm-mm."
1390,"01:18:23,407","01:18:25,325","- My therapist?
- Nada."
1391,"01:18:25,409","01:18:27,077","- My tattoo artist?
- Uh…nope."
1392,"01:18:27,160","01:18:29,454","- My tattoo removal artist?
- No dice."
1393,"01:18:29,538","01:18:32,958","B-But surely you, my chancellor,"
1394,"01:18:33,041","01:18:35,127",my loyal faithful…?
1395,"01:18:35,210","01:18:36,336",Sorry.
1396,"01:18:45,679","01:18:47,305","Apollo, take me now."
1397,"01:18:47,931","01:18:50,934",I don't have any friends!
1398,"01:18:55,188","01:18:56,690","Well, you got one now!"
1399,"01:18:58,233","01:19:00,485",Really? Who is it?
1400,"01:19:00,569","01:19:02,487",It's me! I'll be your friend.
1401,"01:19:03,488","01:19:04,656",Do you mean it?
1402,"01:19:04,740","01:19:08,368","Yes. But friends don't kidnap
friends' pet snails."
1403,"01:19:08,452","01:19:10,495",But I need that snail.
1404,"01:19:10,579","01:19:13,874","Look, I have a horrible,
disgusting wrinkle."
1405,"01:19:13,957","01:19:16,585","Jumping jellyfish,
it's the size of the Mariana Trench!"
1406,"01:19:16,668","01:19:18,920",Kidding!
1407,"01:19:19,004","01:19:20,255",Looks don't matter.
1408,"01:19:20,338","01:19:22,507",We don't care about little imperfections.
1409,"01:19:22,591","01:19:23,925",Or even big ones!
1410,"01:19:24,009","01:19:26,386","- Just look at Squidward.
- What's that supposed to mean?"
1411,"01:19:26,470","01:19:28,472",What's important is what's inside.
1412,"01:19:28,555","01:19:30,724","And I'm sure you can be
a fair and kind king"
1413,"01:19:30,807","01:19:32,601",to all the creatures of the sea.
1414,"01:19:32,768","01:19:34,519","I know you've got it in you, sir."
1415,"01:19:35,061","01:19:37,230",If you'd just let your hair down a little.
1416,"01:19:37,314","01:19:40,859",Huh? My hair? Wait a minute.
1417,"01:19:41,109","01:19:43,195",Are you suggesting that I don't need this
1418,"01:19:43,278","01:19:45,322",gorgeous mane of wavy locks?
1419,"01:19:47,908","01:19:49,409",That I don't require this neck clip?
1420,"01:19:54,331","01:19:56,416","Be gone, perfect shiny teeth!"
1421,"01:19:58,001","01:19:59,294",This is so freeing!
1422,"01:19:59,377","01:20:01,713",To heck with this chest plate and girdle.
1423,"01:20:03,381","01:20:05,175","- Oh, wow.
- Too far?"
1424,"01:20:05,258","01:20:06,760",No! Not at all!
1425,"01:20:06,843","01:20:08,845","No, you look great!"
1426,"01:20:09,304","01:20:13,558","Oh, thank you!
I find this so exhilarating."
1427,"01:20:13,642","01:20:15,477",So… age appropriate.
1428,"01:20:15,936","01:20:18,563","SpongeBob, few possess the courage"
1429,"01:20:18,647","01:20:20,607",to stand up to a powerful king.
1430,"01:20:20,690","01:20:24,945","You, sir, are among those few.
I salute you."
1431,"01:20:25,028","01:20:26,905","Nailed it, SpongeBob."
1432,"01:20:27,697","01:20:28,782",Sage out.
1433,"01:20:30,033","01:20:31,618",You may keep Gary.
1434,"01:20:31,701","01:20:34,746",And I wish you many happy years together.
1435,"01:20:34,830","01:20:37,290","Thank you!
Did you hear that, Gare-Bear?"
1436,"01:20:38,792","01:20:40,210","Uh, your royal robe, Your Highness."
1437,"01:20:40,293","01:20:43,088","- It's getting cold out here.
- Nonsense, Chancellor."
1438,"01:20:43,171","01:20:44,548",I'm free!
1439,"01:20:44,631","01:20:46,550","Ooh, you certainly are."
1440,"01:20:46,633","01:20:48,844",And free the snails!
1441,"01:20:54,432","01:20:55,432",What's that?
1442,"01:20:58,353","01:20:59,604",All of them?
1443,"01:21:07,028","01:21:08,405",I'm home!
1444,"01:21:10,156","01:21:11,156","Hello, Gary."
1445,"01:21:12,117","01:21:13,118","Hello, Brian."
1446,"01:21:16,746","01:21:19,708","Hello, Janet. Hello, June.
Hola, Lupe."
1447,"01:21:21,960","01:21:23,587","- Morning, Sally!
- Hi, Brett!"
1448,"01:21:40,478","01:21:42,564","Come on, Gary! You can do it!"
1449,"01:21:45,650","01:21:46,776",Yeah!
1450,"01:21:52,908","01:21:55,368","Fabio! Where are you, buddy?"
1451,"01:21:55,994","01:21:57,495","Here, Fabio, Fabio, Fabio!"
1452,"01:22:00,248","01:22:02,959","Come on, Fifi. No."
1453,"01:22:23,897","01:22:24,898",Order up!
