and dogs out there!"

all right."

to wash your hands!"
7,"00:01:10,680","00:01:11,680","Okay, Mom!"
8,"00:01:16,160","00:01:17,559","- Do you see him?
- No."
9,"00:01:17,760","00:01:18,909","Well, he's done for."
10,"00:01:19,000","00:01:20,149",He'll be lost! Forever!

Raise the blinds."
17,"00:01:52,880","00:01:54,440","They have names?
You never told me that."
18,"00:01:54,520","00:01:55,520",You never asked.
19,"00:01:56,480","00:01:57,480",Where is he?
20,"00:01:59,120","00:02:00,155",There!
21,"00:02:00,240","00:02:01,280",How do we reach him?
22,"00:02:01,400","00:02:02,753",Operation Pull-Toy!

27,"00:02:37,880","00:02:39,108","Hang on, R.C.!"
28,"00:02:48,520","00:02:51,034",I ain't got any more slink!
29,"00:03:28,680","00:03:29,874","Oh, it's beautiful."
30,"00:03:29,960","00:03:31,016",I'm so glad to see
31,"00:03:31,040","00:03:32,439","this old lamp
go to a good home."
32,"00:03:32,600","00:03:34,079","We've had it since
Molly was a baby."
33,"00:03:35,600","00:03:36,999","Molly, are you sure
it's all right?"
34,"00:03:37,080","00:03:38,496","Yeah,
I don't want it anymore."
35,"00:03:38,520","00:03:39,873",Thank you.
36,"00:03:46,840","00:03:47,909",Where's Woody?
37,"00:03:56,480","00:03:58,311","Yeah, hi.
I think I left my keys here."
38,"00:04:00,080","00:04:01,115","- Woody.
- Quick!"
39,"00:04:01,200","00:04:02,880","We'll sneak in the hedges
before he's back."
40,"00:04:03,040","00:04:04,871","Woody, it's okay."
41,"00:04:05,040","00:04:07,110","What? No! No, no, no.
You can't go!"
42,"00:04:07,200","00:04:08,376","What's best for Andy
is that..."
43,"00:04:08,400","00:04:09,469",Woody.
44,"00:04:09,760","00:04:11,318",I'm not Andy's toy.
45,"00:04:12,240","00:04:13,673",What?
46,"00:04:13,840","00:04:15,637",It's time for the next kid.
47,"00:04:15,800","00:04:17,456","Oh, and thank you again
for everything."
48,"00:04:17,480","00:04:18,549",I really appreciate it.
49,"00:04:18,640","00:04:20,949","Oh, my pleasure.
I'm glad it all worked out."
50,"00:04:22,920","00:04:26,276","You know, kids lose
their toys every day."
51,"00:04:27,880","00:04:29,950","Sometimes they get
left in the yard..."
52,"00:04:30,880","00:04:32,916",or put in the wrong box.
53,"00:04:38,120","00:04:41,112",And that box gets taken away.
54,"00:04:49,280","00:04:50,395","Mom, where's Woody?"
55,"00:04:50,600","00:04:52,158",Andy! Come inside!
56,"00:04:52,240","00:04:53,240",I can't find Woody!
57,"00:05:14,680","00:05:15,749","Well, good night."
58,"00:05:15,840","00:05:17,671","Goodbye.
Drive safe."
59,"00:05:37,640","00:05:39,596","Oh, there you are."
60,"00:05:39,960","00:05:41,678","Mom, I found him! I found him!"
61,"00:05:41,760","00:05:44,513","Oh, good.
Come on and get inside."
62,"00:06:06,440","00:06:08,510",You've got a friend in me
63,"00:06:08,720","00:06:10,790",Reach for the sky!
64,"00:06:10,960","00:06:13,428",You've got a friend in me
65,"00:06:15,040","00:06:16,951","Ride 'em, cowboy! Yee-haw!"
66,"00:06:17,520","00:06:18,720","When the road looks
rough ahead"
67,"00:06:18,800","00:06:20,472",There's a snake in my boot.
68,"00:06:20,560","00:06:22,520","And you're miles and miles
From your nice warm bed"
69,"00:06:23,560","00:06:26,677","You just remember
what your old pal said"
70,"00:06:26,840","00:06:28,831","Boy, you've got a friend in me"
71,"00:06:28,920","00:06:30,353",To infinity and beyond!
72,"00:06:31,040","00:06:34,316","Yeah, you've got
a friend in me"
73,"00:06:35,440","00:06:37,271",My cowboy!
74,"00:06:37,440","00:06:40,000","Now, some other folks might be
a little bit smarter than I am"
75,"00:06:40,160","00:06:41,354","Big and stronger, too"
76,"00:06:41,440","00:06:43,032","Woody, let's go!"
77,"00:06:43,200","00:06:44,200",Maybe
78,"00:06:44,360","00:06:46,351","But none of them will ever
love you the way I do"
79,"00:06:46,440","00:06:48,192",You're my favorite deputy!
80,"00:06:49,800","00:06:52,394","It's me and you, boy"
81,"00:06:52,560","00:06:54,949",And as the years go by
82,"00:06:55,920","00:06:57,194",Our friendship will never die
83,"00:06:57,280","00:06:59,191",Reach for the sky!
84,"00:07:00,560","00:07:02,039","You're gonna see
it's our destiny"
85,"00:07:02,120","00:07:04,634","They've escaped and they're
headed right for us!"
86,"00:07:05,480","00:07:07,994",You've got a friend in me
87,"00:07:09,640","00:07:12,438","- Full speed ahead! Yay!
- You've got a friend in me"
88,"00:07:13,600","00:07:16,398",You've got a friend in me
89,"00:07:28,600","00:07:29,656",It's getting hot in here!
90,"00:07:29,680","00:07:30,776",Where's my ear?
91,"00:07:30,800","00:07:31,800",You're on my foot!
92,"00:07:31,880","00:07:32,936","Oh, hey,
quit shoving."
93,"00:07:32,960","00:07:34,016","- Sorry!
- Could you move over"
94,"00:07:34,040","00:07:35,440","- a bit, please?
- That was my horn."
95,"00:07:36,720","00:07:37,896",To infinity and beyond!
96,"00:07:37,920","00:07:39,200","I know that was you,
Potato Head."
97,"00:07:40,120","00:07:41,872","Everyone, listen.
I thought I told you..."
98,"00:07:41,960","00:07:43,951","when Mom quickly cleans
the bedroom like that..."
99,"00:07:44,120","00:07:45,792","expect to be put
in the closet."
100,"00:07:45,880","00:07:47,598",How much longer?
101,"00:07:47,760","00:07:49,079","Keep it to a dull roar, Rex."
102,"00:07:49,280","00:07:50,872","Deep breaths, Jessie.
Deep breaths."
103,"00:07:50,960","00:07:52,456","Settle down, Slink."
104,"00:07:52,480","00:07:53,674",Sit. Good boy!
105,"00:07:53,760","00:07:54,976","Sheriff,
do I need to be worried?"
106,"00:07:55,000","00:07:56,976","No, no. My guys are veterans.
They'll hang in there."
107,"00:07:57,000","00:07:59,036","Good. Just keep them calm
until we get word."
108,"00:07:59,200","00:08:00,200","Yes, ma'am."
109,"00:08:03,440","00:08:05,317","How are you, uh,
feeling about today?"
110,"00:08:05,480","00:08:07,755","Uh, good, good. Yeah, good."
111,"00:08:07,960","00:08:09,029",I'm good.
112,"00:08:09,240","00:08:10,639",Uh... Good.
113,"00:08:12,960","00:08:14,791","We're on!
Bonnie's done with breakfast!"
114,"00:08:14,960","00:08:16,313","- Any minute now.
- You hear that?"
115,"00:08:16,400","00:08:17,594",Any minute now.
116,"00:08:17,680","00:08:18,749",Wind 'em if you got 'em.
117,"00:08:18,840","00:08:20,800","Keep your batteries clean,
your joints unlocked..."
118,"00:08:20,880","00:08:21,960","Uh, thanks, Woody.
I got it."
119,"00:08:22,040","00:08:24,270","Yes, I'm sorry.
You're right, you're right."
120,"00:08:25,520","00:08:27,988",The town is open!
121,"00:08:28,080","00:08:29,080","Hi, Mayor!"
122,"00:08:29,160","00:08:30,160",Banker!
123,"00:08:30,280","00:08:31,838","Hi, Ice-Cream Man!
Hi, Hat Shop Owner!"
124,"00:08:32,160","00:08:33,354",Mailman!
125,"00:08:33,440","00:08:34,998",And the sheriff!
126,"00:08:35,760","00:08:37,671","Okay. Bye, toys!"
127,"00:08:37,840","00:08:39,637",Yee-haw! Sheriff Jessie!
128,"00:08:39,800","00:08:41,472","Giddy-up, Bullseye!"
129,"00:08:47,400","00:08:48,674",They went that way!
130,"00:08:48,880","00:08:49,995",Chase them!
131,"00:08:53,360","00:08:55,828","What a beautiful hat shop!
You have so many hats..."
132,"00:08:55,920","00:08:57,536","Wow.
They're doing ""hat shop."""
133,"00:08:57,560","00:08:58,816",When's the last time
134,"00:08:58,840","00:08:59,875",we ever got to play that?
135,"00:08:59,960","00:09:01,393","Remember when
she played ""house""?"
136,"00:09:01,480","00:09:02,515","I liked ""house."""
137,"00:09:02,680","00:09:03,795",Those were the days.
138,"00:09:03,960","00:09:05,313","It was basic.
You made a house,"
139,"00:09:05,440","00:09:06,440","you lived in it, done."
140,"00:09:06,720","00:09:08,153",Hmm. That's the third time
141,"00:09:08,240","00:09:09,560","you haven't been picked
this week."
142,"00:09:09,600","00:09:10,953","I don't know.
I don't keep count."
143,"00:09:11,120","00:09:12,758","Oh, you don't have to."
144,"00:09:12,920","00:09:14,856","- I'll do it for you.
- Okay, okay, okay, I get it."
145,"00:09:14,880","00:09:15,880",It's been a while.
146,"00:09:16,040","00:09:18,508","Oh, looky there.
You got your first dust bunny."
147,"00:09:19,160","00:09:20,673","Aw, how adorable."
148,"00:09:20,840","00:09:21,875",What you gonna name it?
149,"00:09:22,080","00:09:23,080","Uh, what about Dusty?"
150,"00:09:23,160","00:09:24,296","- Francis!
- Harry!"
151,"00:09:24,320","00:09:25,416","- Karen!
- Fuzzball!"
152,"00:09:25,440","00:09:26,509","- LeBron?
- No, Fluffy."
153,"00:09:26,600","00:09:28,176","- How about Thumper?
- Tumbleweed!"
154,"00:09:28,200","00:09:29,880","""Tumbleweed.""
Oh, that's good. That's good."
155,"00:09:29,960","00:09:31,016","He's a cowboy,"
156,"00:09:31,040","00:09:32,176",so that makes a lot of sense.
157,"00:09:32,200","00:09:33,918",So many choices.
158,"00:09:34,080","00:09:35,274",I just can't decide!
159,"00:09:35,360","00:09:36,360",Bonnie?
160,"00:09:36,440","00:09:37,714","What are you doing?
We gotta go."
161,"00:09:37,800","00:09:38,800",You don't wanna be late
162,"00:09:38,880","00:09:40,136","for kindergarten orientation,
do you?"
163,"00:09:40,160","00:09:42,355",But I don't wanna go.
164,"00:09:42,440","00:09:43,936",We talked about this.
165,"00:09:43,960","00:09:45,188","We're gonna meet
your teachers,"
166,"00:09:45,280","00:09:47,111","- see your classroom...
- Can I bring a toy?"
167,"00:09:47,280","00:09:50,033","Toys don't go to school,
that's the rule."
168,"00:09:54,200","00:09:55,428",Freeze! Nobody move!
169,"00:09:55,600","00:09:56,840","Bonnie always
forgets something."
170,"00:09:56,960","00:09:58,234",She'll be back any second.
171,"00:09:58,400","00:09:59,594","That goes for you, too, Hamm."
172,"00:09:59,760","00:10:00,760",But it's money!
173,"00:10:01,640","00:10:02,640","You all right, Woody?"
174,"00:10:02,720","00:10:03,856","I'm sure she'll pick you
next time."
175,"00:10:03,880","00:10:05,871","Oh, come on, I'm fine.
No problem."
176,"00:10:06,080","00:10:07,149","Hey, Woody. Here."
177,"00:10:07,240","00:10:08,309","Oh, thanks, Jessie."
178,"00:10:08,480","00:10:10,118","We're here for you, buddy."
179,"00:10:10,880","00:10:11,936","I don't want to play
the baker."
180,"00:10:11,960","00:10:12,960",Pricklepants.
181,"00:10:13,040","00:10:15,076","The hat shop owner is
the role I was born to play!"
182,"00:10:15,160","00:10:16,776","All right, Pricklepants,
back to your bakery."
183,"00:10:16,800","00:10:17,800","Excuse me, Dolly?"
184,"00:10:17,880","00:10:19,296","Woody, can't you see
I'm threatening everyone?"
185,"00:10:19,320","00:10:20,320",Go back to the closet.
186,"00:10:20,400","00:10:21,456","Yeah, I know, I know.
It's just..."
187,"00:10:21,480","00:10:22,674",I'm worried about Bonnie.
188,"00:10:22,760","00:10:24,557","A toy should go with her
to orientation."
189,"00:10:24,720","00:10:26,680","Didn't you hear Dad?
You'll get Bonnie in trouble."
190,"00:10:26,840","00:10:28,512","Yeah, but kindergarten
is so different."
191,"00:10:28,680","00:10:30,193",It can be too much for a kid.
192,"00:10:30,280","00:10:31,616","Having a buddy with them
to get through it"
193,"00:10:31,640","00:10:32,640",can really help things.
194,"00:10:32,720","00:10:34,416","I remember with Andy, I would
go to school with him..."
195,"00:10:34,440","00:10:35,475","Uh-huh. I'm sorry, Woody,"
196,"00:10:35,560","00:10:36,736","I hate to sound
like a broken record..."
197,"00:10:36,760","00:10:38,113",but Bonnie's not Andy.
198,"00:10:38,240","00:10:39,673","No, no, no, of course,
I get that."
199,"00:10:39,760","00:10:40,954",But if you would just...
200,"00:10:41,160","00:10:42,593","Places, everyone!"
201,"00:10:56,320","00:10:57,514",Bonnie?
202,"00:10:58,240","00:10:59,832",What are you doing back there?
203,"00:11:00,000","00:11:02,070","Come on, we have to go."
204,"00:11:04,240","00:11:05,878",That's my big girl.
205,"00:11:05,960","00:11:08,474","Come on. We gotta hurry, okay?"
206,"00:11:09,240","00:11:11,231",Don't forget your backpack.
207,"00:11:11,440","00:11:14,000","You're gonna
have so much fun."
208,"00:11:15,640","00:11:18,552","All right. Now what was it
you were saying, Woody?"
209,"00:11:19,600","00:11:20,874",Woody?
210,"00:11:28,400","00:11:30,072",Here we are.
211,"00:11:46,600","00:11:48,830","Bonnie, honey,
it'll be okay."
212,"00:11:49,000","00:11:51,070",Hi! Are you Bonnie?
213,"00:11:51,360","00:11:52,360",My name is Miss Wendy.
214,"00:11:52,480","00:11:54,120","I'm going to be
your kindergarten teacher."
215,"00:11:56,280","00:11:59,078","We have a special place where
you can put your backpack."
216,"00:11:59,480","00:12:01,072",You want to see?
217,"00:12:21,160","00:12:22,991","Here we are, Bonnie.
Just for you."
218,"00:12:23,160","00:12:25,549","Okay, class, let's all find
a seat at a table..."
219,"00:12:25,760","00:12:27,955",so we can start craft time.
220,"00:12:28,120","00:12:29,348","On the first day of school,"
221,"00:12:29,440","00:12:31,510","you'll need a place
to put your pencils."
222,"00:12:31,680","00:12:34,877","So, today, we're going
to make pencil holders."
223,"00:12:35,960","00:12:37,359","Now, everyone take a cup..."
224,"00:12:37,520","00:12:40,592","and we'll use the art supplies
to decorate them."
225,"00:12:42,160","00:12:43,275",Hi.
226,"00:14:10,160","00:14:12,674",Bonnie. That is so clever.
227,"00:14:12,800","00:14:15,792","""Hello, I'm Forky.
Nice to meet you!"""
228,"00:14:16,000","00:14:17,672","Well, hello, Forky,
it's nice to meet you."
229,"00:14:17,840","00:14:19,193",I'm Miss Wendy.
230,"00:14:22,040","00:14:24,110","Mom! Dad!
Look what I made!"
231,"00:14:24,400","00:14:25,515",His name is Forky!
232,"00:14:25,600","00:14:27,033","- Wow!
- That is so cool!"
233,"00:14:27,120","00:14:28,872",I finished kindergarten!
234,"00:14:29,240","00:14:30,280",Uh...
235,"00:14:30,360","00:14:32,828","No.
That was just orientation."
236,"00:14:33,000","00:14:34,399","But for being
such a brave girl,"
237,"00:14:34,480","00:14:35,754",we have a surprise for you.
238,"00:14:35,840","00:14:36,840",What is it?
239,"00:14:37,000","00:14:38,056",Since school doesn't start
240,"00:14:38,080","00:14:40,548","for another week,
we are going on a road trip!"
241,"00:14:40,720","00:14:42,696","- Can I bring Forky?
- 'Course you can!"
242,"00:14:42,720","00:14:44,039",Yay!
243,"00:14:49,040","00:14:52,032","And they said I shouldn't
go to school with Bonnie."
244,"00:14:52,680","00:14:55,069","We got this kindergarten thing
under control, eh?"
245,"00:14:55,520","00:14:58,080","I can't believe
I'm talking to a spork."
246,"00:15:07,240","00:15:08,559","Hi, toys!
Bye, toys!"
247,"00:15:09,560","00:15:10,834",Ow.
248,"00:15:14,840","00:15:16,114",He did go to kindergarten!
249,"00:15:16,200","00:15:17,616","- I knew it.
- No, no, no, guys, listen..."
250,"00:15:17,640","00:15:18,696","You tryin' to get
Bonnie in trouble?"
251,"00:15:18,720","00:15:19,835","No, of course not!"
252,"00:15:19,920","00:15:21,056","You could have been
confiscated."
253,"00:15:21,080","00:15:22,957","- What does that mean?
- Taken away."
254,"00:15:23,040","00:15:24,189","- No!
- Or worse."
255,"00:15:24,280","00:15:25,280",You could've been lost!
256,"00:15:25,480","00:15:26,480","No, no, no, guys, listen."
257,"00:15:26,640","00:15:28,153","Bonnie had a great day
in class..."
258,"00:15:28,360","00:15:29,560","and we're going
on a road trip."
259,"00:15:29,720","00:15:30,994","- Road trip?
- Vacation!"
260,"00:15:31,200","00:15:32,269",Yee-haw!
261,"00:15:32,440","00:15:34,040","But then something
really weird happened."
262,"00:15:34,240","00:15:35,798",Bonnie made a friend in class.
263,"00:15:35,960","00:15:36,960",What a kid.
264,"00:15:37,080","00:15:38,216","Oh, she's already
making friends."
265,"00:15:38,240","00:15:41,152","No, no. She literally made
a new friend."
266,"00:15:41,520","00:15:43,192","Hey, it's okay."
267,"00:15:43,360","00:15:45,396",Come on out. That's it.
268,"00:15:45,480","00:15:47,357","Come on, there you go."
269,"00:15:49,760","00:15:51,557","Come on,
let's get you out of there."
270,"00:15:51,760","00:15:53,113",You got this.
271,"00:15:53,200","00:15:55,031",Good. Good.
272,"00:15:55,200","00:15:58,272","Everyone, I want you
to meet Forky."
273,"00:15:58,360","00:16:00,096","- Golly bob howdy!
- Look at that!"
274,"00:16:00,120","00:16:02,350",Look how long his arms are!
275,"00:16:02,560","00:16:04,118","- Trash?
- No."
276,"00:16:04,280","00:16:06,157","No, toys."
277,"00:16:06,360","00:16:08,237",They're all toys.
278,"00:16:10,120","00:16:11,519","- Trash?
- No, no, no."
279,"00:16:11,680","00:16:13,636",That's the trash.
280,"00:16:13,800","00:16:14,949",These are your friends.
281,"00:16:15,160","00:16:16,593",Hi!
282,"00:16:16,800","00:16:18,074",Trash!
283,"00:16:18,160","00:16:19,576","- No, no, it's okay.
- Trash!"
284,"00:16:19,600","00:16:20,880","Woody,
I have a question."
285,"00:16:21,400","00:16:22,680","Um, well, actually,
not just one,"
286,"00:16:22,760","00:16:23,795",I have all of them.
287,"00:16:24,000","00:16:25,513",I have all the questions.
288,"00:16:25,600","00:16:27,096","Uh, why does he want
to go to the trash?"
289,"00:16:27,120","00:16:28,320","Because he was made
from trash."
290,"00:16:28,360","00:16:29,360",Trash!
291,"00:16:29,440","00:16:30,920","Look, I know
this is a little strange,"
292,"00:16:31,000","00:16:32,200","but you gotta trust me
on this."
293,"00:16:32,240","00:16:33,240",Trash?
294,"00:16:33,320","00:16:36,995","Forky is the most important
toy to Bonnie right now."
295,"00:16:37,160","00:16:38,280",Important?
296,"00:16:38,320","00:16:39,389",He's a spork.
297,"00:16:39,480","00:16:41,198","Yes. Yeah, I know,
but this spork..."
298,"00:16:41,360","00:16:43,590",this toy is crucial to Bonnie
299,"00:16:43,680","00:16:45,830","getting adjusted
to kindergarten. Oh."
300,"00:16:45,920","00:16:47,035","Woody, aren't you being"
301,"00:16:47,120","00:16:48,256","a little dramatic
about all this?"
302,"00:16:48,280","00:16:49,759","I know this is new
to everybody..."
303,"00:16:49,840","00:16:51,034",but you should see how much
304,"00:16:51,120","00:16:52,599","this little guy
means to Bonnie."
305,"00:16:52,760","00:16:55,274","When she started
playing with him..."
306,"00:16:55,440","00:16:57,476","she had the biggest smile
on her face."
307,"00:16:57,640","00:16:58,840",I wish you could have seen it.
308,"00:16:58,960","00:17:00,000",Bonnie was really upset...
309,"00:17:00,200","00:17:01,713","and I swear,
once she made Forky..."
310,"00:17:01,880","00:17:03,472","it was
a complete transformation."
311,"00:17:03,640","00:17:05,710","- Uh, Woody?
- Just a second, Jessie."
312,"00:17:05,920","00:17:09,435","So, we all have to make sure
nothing happens to him."
313,"00:17:09,600","00:17:11,352",Something happened to him.
314,"00:17:12,880","00:17:14,359","Oh, Chutes and Ladders!"
315,"00:17:14,520","00:17:15,520","Ah, trash."
316,"00:17:15,600","00:17:16,776","- No, no, no!
- No! No!"
317,"00:17:16,800","00:17:18,136","You're a toy now,
Forky! Come on!"
318,"00:17:18,160","00:17:19,229",Stop! Stop it!
319,"00:17:19,320","00:17:20,856","- Hey! No, no, no! Come on!
- Trash!"
320,"00:17:20,880","00:17:22,096",Trash! Trash!
321,"00:17:22,120","00:17:24,350","Well, I guess
I'll just babysit him"
322,"00:17:24,480","00:17:25,754",till he's used to the room.
323,"00:17:29,280","00:17:30,474",Hmm.
324,"00:17:32,960","00:17:34,234",Forky?
325,"00:17:34,400","00:17:36,038","Where are you, Forky?"
326,"00:17:36,720","00:17:37,789",There you are!
327,"00:17:37,960","00:17:39,916","I thought I'd lost you, silly."
328,"00:17:53,640","00:17:56,154","No, no, no.
Big girl scary!"
329,"00:17:56,320","00:17:58,880","Like I said before,
Bonnie's not scary."
330,"00:17:59,040","00:18:00,792","She loves you
and you need to..."
331,"00:18:00,880","00:18:02,108",Ooh.
332,"00:18:18,600","00:18:19,953",Forky?
333,"00:18:22,600","00:18:24,113",Bonnie!
334,"00:18:24,480","00:18:25,480",Let's go!
335,"00:18:25,560","00:18:27,790",Rise and shine!
336,"00:18:27,880","00:18:29,552","Who wants to go
on a road trip?"
337,"00:18:29,640","00:18:32,154","Me! I'm gonna bring
Dolly, and Buttercup..."
338,"00:18:32,320","00:18:34,151","and Forky, and..."
339,"00:18:34,320","00:18:36,072",Forky? Where are you?
340,"00:18:36,160","00:18:37,576","He's gotta be
here somewhere."
341,"00:18:37,600","00:18:38,600",Forky?
342,"00:18:39,760","00:18:40,760",Forky!
343,"00:18:40,920","00:18:43,480","Come on. Let's eat some
breakfast and hit the road!"
344,"00:18:43,600","00:18:45,113","Let's go, Forky!"
345,"00:18:49,680","00:18:51,272","Whoa. He's quite
a handful, Woody."
346,"00:18:51,480","00:18:53,040","You need help with him
on the road trip?"
347,"00:18:53,200","00:18:55,714","No. No, no. I got it,
I got it."
348,"00:18:56,160","00:18:57,957",We'll just be stuck in an RV.
349,"00:18:58,120","00:18:59,792","He can't get far.
I got this."
350,"00:18:59,880","00:19:00,880",I got it.
351,"00:19:05,680","00:19:07,398",I can't let you
352,"00:19:07,920","00:19:09,751",I can't let you
353,"00:19:10,200","00:19:13,431","I can't let you
throw yourself away"
354,"00:19:14,720","00:19:19,111","- I can't let you
- CHORUS: I can't let you"
355,"00:19:19,280","00:19:21,236","I can't let you
throw yourself away"
356,"00:19:23,680","00:19:26,956","Don't you want to see
the sun come up each morning?"
357,"00:19:27,040","00:19:28,792","No, no!"
358,"00:19:28,880","00:19:31,269","Don't you want to see
the sun go down each day?"
359,"00:19:33,240","00:19:36,949","Don't you want to see that
little girl that loves you so?"
360,"00:19:37,120","00:19:38,712",Her heart would break
361,"00:19:38,800","00:19:39,869","Oh, yeah!"
362,"00:19:40,040","00:19:41,439",If you should go
363,"00:19:42,320","00:19:46,677","- I can't let you
- CHORUS: I can't let you"
364,"00:19:46,840","00:19:48,016","I can't let you
throw yourself away"
365,"00:19:48,040","00:19:49,075","No, no, no!"
366,"00:19:50,560","00:19:51,560",No! No! No!
367,"00:19:51,720","00:19:54,632","So it seems to me like you're
never gonna behave yourself"
368,"00:19:55,560","00:19:58,313","Since I'm not gonna
do this every day"
369,"00:20:00,840","00:20:04,628","Come tomorrow, you're gonna
have to save yourself"
370,"00:20:04,800","00:20:06,756",Got nothing more to say
371,"00:20:06,920","00:20:09,593",You're not listening anyway
372,"00:20:09,760","00:20:13,878","- I can't let you
- CHORUS: I can't let you"
373,"00:20:13,960","00:20:15,056","Trash, here I come!"
374,"00:20:15,080","00:20:16,216","I can't let you
throw yourself away"
375,"00:20:16,240","00:20:17,389",Come on.
376,"00:20:18,680","00:20:20,318",I can't let you
377,"00:20:21,360","00:20:22,952",I can't let you
378,"00:20:23,120","00:20:24,376","I can't let you
throw yourself away"
379,"00:20:24,400","00:20:26,356",I don't wanna be a toy!
380,"00:20:27,800","00:20:31,998","- I can't let you
- CHORUS: I can't let you"
381,"00:20:32,160","00:20:35,789","I can't let you
throw yourself away"
382,"00:21:00,000","00:21:01,069","Hey, buddy."
383,"00:21:01,280","00:21:02,508","Hey, Buzz."
384,"00:21:03,000","00:21:04,228",You doing okay?
385,"00:21:04,400","00:21:05,400","I don't know, Buzz."
386,"00:21:06,400","00:21:08,755","I know you weren't around
when Andy was little..."
387,"00:21:08,920","00:21:11,559","but I don't remember it
being this hard."
388,"00:21:13,240","00:21:14,639","Want me to take
the next watch?"
389,"00:21:14,720","00:21:15,760",I'll keep an eye on Forky.
390,"00:21:16,120","00:21:17,917","No, no. I need to do this."
391,"00:21:18,080","00:21:19,229",That little voice inside me
392,"00:21:19,320","00:21:21,436","would never leave me alone
if I gave up."
393,"00:21:21,880","00:21:22,915",Huh.
394,"00:21:24,040","00:21:25,473",Who do you think it is?
395,"00:21:25,640","00:21:26,709",Who?
396,"00:21:26,880","00:21:29,394","The voice inside of you.
Who do you think it is?"
397,"00:21:30,280","00:21:31,315",Uh...
398,"00:21:31,640","00:21:32,675",Me.
399,"00:21:32,840","00:21:34,114","You know, my conscience?"
400,"00:21:36,680","00:21:39,148","That part of you
that tells you things?"
401,"00:21:39,360","00:21:40,480",What you're really thinking?
402,"00:21:41,960","00:21:43,279",Fascinating.
403,"00:21:43,440","00:21:46,113","So, your inner voice
advises you."
404,"00:21:46,320","00:21:47,320",What?
405,"00:21:49,240","00:21:51,280","It's a secret
mission in uncharted space."
406,"00:21:51,360","00:21:52,360",Let's go.
407,"00:21:56,040","00:21:57,040",Where's Forky?
408,"00:21:58,760","00:21:59,954","Oh, no!
Forky!"
409,"00:22:00,960","00:22:01,995",Forky!
410,"00:22:02,400","00:22:03,594",I am not a toy!
411,"00:22:03,680","00:22:04,874",I'm a spork.
412,"00:22:04,960","00:22:05,960",Be quiet!
413,"00:22:06,040","00:22:07,439","I was made for soup, salad..."
414,"00:22:07,600","00:22:09,636","maybe chili,
and then the trash."
415,"00:22:09,800","00:22:11,074",I'm litter!
416,"00:22:11,160","00:22:12,160",Freedom!
417,"00:22:15,080","00:22:16,672","Hamm, how far
to our next stop?"
418,"00:22:16,840","00:22:18,478","5.32 miles, give or take."
419,"00:22:18,640","00:22:19,675",I can make that.
420,"00:22:19,840","00:22:21,068",I'll meet you at the RV park.
421,"00:22:21,240","00:22:23,071","Woody, hold on a minute.
Woody!"
422,"00:22:41,520","00:22:42,873",Forky!
423,"00:22:44,120","00:22:46,475","Forky, where are you?"
424,"00:22:46,640","00:22:48,073",Forky!
425,"00:22:48,240","00:22:49,593","Forky, where are you?"
426,"00:23:07,760","00:23:09,478","- Carry me?
- No."
427,"00:23:10,280","00:23:11,872",Why do I have to be a toy?
428,"00:23:12,040","00:23:13,176",Because you have Bonnie's name
429,"00:23:13,200","00:23:14,713","written on the bottom
of your sticks."
430,"00:23:14,880","00:23:15,960",Why do I have Bonnie's name
431,"00:23:16,040","00:23:17,598","written on the bottom
of my sticks?"
432,"00:23:17,760","00:23:19,034",Because she...
433,"00:23:20,720","00:23:24,349","Look, she plays with you
all the time, right?"
434,"00:23:24,440","00:23:25,714",Ugh. Yes.
435,"00:23:25,920","00:23:27,751","And who does she sleep with
every night?"
436,"00:23:27,920","00:23:29,148",The big white fluffy thing?
437,"00:23:29,320","00:23:30,594","No, not her pillow."
438,"00:23:30,800","00:23:32,028",You.
439,"00:23:32,120","00:23:33,997","All right, Forky."
440,"00:23:34,160","00:23:37,675","You have to understand
how lucky you are right now."
441,"00:23:37,840","00:23:38,989",You're Bonnie's toy.
442,"00:23:39,160","00:23:41,355","You are going to help create
happy memories..."
443,"00:23:41,560","00:23:43,596","that will last
for the rest of her life."
444,"00:23:44,840","00:23:45,955",Huh? What?
445,"00:23:47,560","00:23:50,233","Okay.
Doing it for Bonnie."
446,"00:23:50,400","00:23:52,391","Doing this for Bonnie,
you're doing it for Bonnie."
447,"00:23:52,560","00:23:55,711","Okay, like it or not,
you are a toy."
448,"00:23:55,880","00:23:57,393","Maybe you don't like
being one,"
449,"00:23:57,480","00:23:58,674",but you are one nonetheless.
450,"00:23:58,760","00:23:59,988",Which means you are going
451,"00:24:00,080","00:24:01,280","to be there for Andy
when he..."
452,"00:24:01,320","00:24:02,594",Who's Andy?
453,"00:24:03,480","00:24:04,515","I mean, Bonnie."
454,"00:24:04,680","00:24:06,272","You have to be there
for Bonnie."
455,"00:24:06,440","00:24:08,112",That is your job.
456,"00:24:08,280","00:24:09,554","Well, what's your job?"
457,"00:24:09,760","00:24:11,910","Well, right now, it's to make
sure you do yours."
458,"00:24:12,080","00:24:13,672","- Carry me?
- No!"
459,"00:24:19,760","00:24:20,909",Who's Andy?
460,"00:24:22,800","00:24:24,631",Andy was my other kid.
461,"00:24:25,160","00:24:26,991",You had another kid?
462,"00:24:27,160","00:24:28,160","Yeah, yeah."
463,"00:24:28,360","00:24:29,873",For a long time.
464,"00:24:31,400","00:24:33,072",And it was pretty great.
465,"00:24:34,040","00:24:36,156","I was a favorite toy,
actually."
466,"00:24:37,400","00:24:39,470",Running the room was my job.
467,"00:24:39,640","00:24:41,039","Keeping all the toys
in place..."
468,"00:24:41,200","00:24:43,873","So, he thought
Andy's room was a planet?"
469,"00:24:44,080","00:24:45,752","Wow,
that is messed up."
470,"00:24:45,840","00:24:46,875",Right!
471,"00:24:46,960","00:24:48,616","That's exactly what I thought
when he first showed up."
472,"00:24:48,640","00:24:50,870","Yeah. I mean,
how is that not annoying?"
473,"00:24:51,040","00:24:53,190","- Thank you!
- Seriously, that is the..."
474,"00:24:53,360","00:24:55,112","Well, then you
watch 'em grow up"
475,"00:24:55,200","00:24:56,997",and become a full person.
476,"00:24:58,960","00:25:00,552",And then they leave.
477,"00:25:00,720","00:25:02,950","They go off and do things
you'll never see."
478,"00:25:05,240","00:25:07,959","Don't get me wrong,
you still feel good about it."
479,"00:25:08,120","00:25:09,792","But then somehow
you find yourself,"
480,"00:25:09,880","00:25:10,995",after all those years...
481,"00:25:11,160","00:25:14,038","sitting in a closet
just feeling..."
482,"00:25:14,120","00:25:15,189",Useless?
483,"00:25:17,200","00:25:18,269",Yeah.
484,"00:25:18,440","00:25:20,317",Your purpose fulfilled?
485,"00:25:20,840","00:25:22,512",Exactly.
486,"00:25:22,680","00:25:24,272","Woody, I know
what your problem is."
487,"00:25:24,360","00:25:25,360",You do?
488,"00:25:25,440","00:25:26,919",You're just like me.
489,"00:25:27,080","00:25:28,115",Trash!
490,"00:25:28,280","00:25:29,872",What is it with you and trash?
491,"00:25:30,040","00:25:31,439","- It's warm.
- Ew."
492,"00:25:31,600","00:25:32,874","- It's cozy.
- I guess."
493,"00:25:33,040","00:25:34,040",And safe!
494,"00:25:34,120","00:25:35,792","Like somebody's
whispering in your ear,"
495,"00:25:35,880","00:25:37,313","""Everything's gonna be okay."""
496,"00:25:37,960","00:25:39,757","Forky, that's it."
497,"00:25:39,920","00:25:42,639","That's how Bonnie feels
when she's with you."
498,"00:25:42,800","00:25:44,358","- She does?
- Yes!"
499,"00:25:46,760","00:25:47,795",Wait a sec.
500,"00:25:49,160","00:25:50,991","- You mean she thinks I'm warm?
- Yep."
501,"00:25:51,160","00:25:52,229","- And cozy?
- Uh-huh."
502,"00:25:52,440","00:25:53,714",And sometimes kinda squishy?
503,"00:25:53,880","00:25:55,108","Well, that, too. Yes."
504,"00:25:55,320","00:25:56,799",I get it now.
505,"00:25:56,960","00:25:58,029",I'm Bonnie's trash.
506,"00:25:58,240","00:25:59,275","Yes! Wait, what?"
507,"00:25:59,440","00:26:00,555",I am Bonnie's trash!
508,"00:26:00,720","00:26:01,720","No, no, no, not exactly."
509,"00:26:01,880","00:26:03,216","She must be feeling awful
without me."
510,"00:26:03,240","00:26:04,536","Woody, we got to get going,
she needs me!"
511,"00:26:04,560","00:26:06,440","- Yeah... Whoa, whoa.
- Hey, Bonnie, I'm coming!"
512,"00:26:06,760","00:26:07,795","Forky, slow down! Forky!"
513,"00:26:07,920","00:26:09,239","Bonnie, I'm coming!"
514,"00:26:09,400","00:26:10,400",Forky!
515,"00:26:33,840","00:26:36,149","Forky, look.
Bonnie's right over there."
516,"00:26:36,280","00:26:37,474",Hurry!
517,"00:26:42,400","00:26:43,435",Whoo!
518,"00:26:58,600","00:27:00,158",Huh? Woody?
519,"00:27:05,400","00:27:06,435",Bo?
520,"00:27:15,560","00:27:16,754",Woody?
521,"00:27:21,600","00:27:23,477",Aren't we going to Bonnie?
522,"00:27:23,640","00:27:25,915","I know, I know. But my friend
might be in there."
523,"00:27:26,120","00:27:27,189",Friend?
524,"00:27:27,360","00:27:28,839","Oh, a friend, uh..."
525,"00:27:29,040","00:27:30,519","Well, a friend is..."
526,"00:27:30,680","00:27:32,079","Well, a friend is
like you and me."
527,"00:27:32,240","00:27:34,231","- Trash?
- Trash, like... Yes."
528,"00:27:34,400","00:27:36,016","And I'm very worried
that she might be lost."
529,"00:27:36,040","00:27:38,190","But, Woody,
Bonnie's right there."
530,"00:27:38,360","00:27:40,520","Yeah, we'll have you back
before she wakes up. Come on."
531,"00:27:50,400","00:27:51,515",Bo?
532,"00:27:51,720","00:27:52,720",Bo?
533,"00:27:54,440","00:27:56,635",Bo?
534,"00:27:58,400","00:28:00,311","- Bo?
- Bo?"
535,"00:28:01,120","00:28:02,120",Bo?
536,"00:28:02,320","00:28:03,320",Bo.
537,"00:28:03,480","00:28:04,833","Bo, Bo, Bo..."
538,"00:28:07,320","00:28:08,958","- Bo?
- Bo?"
539,"00:28:12,920","00:28:14,114",Can we go back to Bonnie now?
540,"00:28:14,280","00:28:15,349",I don't see your friend.
541,"00:28:15,520","00:28:16,999","Yeah, okay."
542,"00:28:17,160","00:28:18,479",She's not in here.
543,"00:28:18,640","00:28:19,834","Come on, let's go."
544,"00:28:31,280","00:28:32,315",Is that Bo?
545,"00:28:37,080","00:28:39,389","Uh...
Hey, howdy."
546,"00:28:39,560","00:28:40,629",Hey there.
547,"00:28:40,800","00:28:42,119","Uh, sorry to bother you,
but..."
548,"00:28:42,320","00:28:44,080","Why,
you're not a bother at all."
549,"00:28:45,080","00:28:47,230","We were just out
for my early morning stroll."
550,"00:28:47,400","00:28:48,515",And look...
551,"00:28:48,680","00:28:50,511",we met you!
552,"00:28:50,680","00:28:51,874",My name is Gabby Gabby.
553,"00:28:52,000","00:28:54,434","And this is my
very good friend Benson."
554,"00:28:54,600","00:28:56,591","Oh, uh, Woody.
Pleasure to meet you."
555,"00:28:56,760","00:28:59,035","Well, it's nice to meet you,
Woody. And you are...?"
556,"00:28:59,720","00:29:00,720",This is Forky.
557,"00:29:00,920","00:29:02,035",I'm trash.
558,"00:29:02,120","00:29:03,917",Our kid made him.
559,"00:29:04,080","00:29:06,150","Kid? Toys around here
don't have kids."
560,"00:29:06,320","00:29:07,320",Are you two lost?
561,"00:29:07,480","00:29:09,391","Lost? No, no."
562,"00:29:09,600","00:29:12,273","But we are looking
for a lost toy."
563,"00:29:12,440","00:29:15,000","She's a figurine. Used to be
on that lamp in the window?"
564,"00:29:15,160","00:29:16,160",Name's Bo Peep?
565,"00:29:16,320","00:29:17,389",Bo Peep?
566,"00:29:17,480","00:29:19,675","- Oh, yes, I know Bo.
- You do?"
567,"00:29:19,840","00:29:21,120","Hop on in.
We'll take you to her."
568,"00:29:21,200","00:29:22,838","Oh, you don't have to do that."
569,"00:29:23,000","00:29:24,228","Well, okay."
570,"00:29:26,440","00:29:28,795","Benson, be careful
with our new friends."
571,"00:29:30,640","00:29:32,039","Wow, what service."
572,"00:29:38,040","00:29:40,076","Uh...
Thank you for your help."
573,"00:29:40,160","00:29:41,240",I haven't seen Bo in years.
574,"00:29:41,320","00:29:43,072","May I ask, when were you made?"
575,"00:29:43,240","00:29:44,559",Me? Uh...
576,"00:29:44,760","00:29:46,432",I'm not sure. Late '50s?
577,"00:29:46,600","00:29:47,600","Me, too!"
578,"00:29:47,800","00:29:49,760","Gee, I wonder if we were made
in the same factory."
579,"00:29:49,880","00:29:51,552",Wouldn't that be something?
580,"00:29:51,720","00:29:53,631","I gotta say,
you are in great condition."
581,"00:29:53,800","00:29:56,837","Well, I try to stay active."
582,"00:29:57,320","00:29:59,709","And look at that,
you have a voice box like me."
583,"00:29:59,880","00:30:00,880","Benson, show him."
584,"00:30:01,920","00:30:04,434","Oh, that's really
not necessary."
585,"00:30:08,480","00:30:09,708",I'm Gabby Gabby
586,"00:30:09,800","00:30:11,677",and I love you.
587,"00:30:12,080","00:30:13,832","Wow, you need to fix that."
588,"00:30:14,840","00:30:16,831",My record works just fine.
589,"00:30:16,960","00:30:18,712","It's the voice box
that's broken."
590,"00:30:18,920","00:30:19,920",Does yours still work?
591,"00:30:20,000","00:30:21,000",Hey!
592,"00:30:21,080","00:30:22,560",There's a snake in my boot!
593,"00:30:22,640","00:30:24,790","Listen to that!
Let's see it."
594,"00:30:24,960","00:30:26,109",I bet it's the same type.
595,"00:30:26,280","00:30:28,475","No, thanks,
mine's sewn inside."
596,"00:30:28,680","00:30:30,159","Is Bo around here?
Because we need..."
597,"00:30:32,520","00:30:33,669",Oh.
598,"00:30:33,760","00:30:35,113",The store is about to open.
599,"00:30:35,280","00:30:37,360","Don't worry, we'll take you
where no one will see us."
600,"00:30:37,400","00:30:39,152","Oh, no. We can't stay."
601,"00:30:39,320","00:30:40,469","Yes, you can."
602,"00:30:51,920","00:30:53,148",We gotta go.
603,"00:30:53,320","00:30:56,437","You can't leave yet.
You have what I need."
604,"00:30:56,600","00:30:59,512",Right inside there.
605,"00:31:00,760","00:31:01,976","Returned that lamp
the next day."
606,"00:31:02,000","00:31:03,056",You're kidding me!
607,"00:31:03,080","00:31:04,798","Mom, can we go
to the park now?"
608,"00:31:04,960","00:31:05,995",Harmony!
609,"00:31:08,520","00:31:10,317","Stop him, please."
610,"00:31:20,800","00:31:21,800",What's going on?
611,"00:31:23,800","00:31:25,074",Come on! Let's go!
612,"00:31:25,240","00:31:26,958","He's coming, he's coming!
I see him!"
613,"00:31:27,120","00:31:28,997",Forky? We got to get out of...
614,"00:31:29,400","00:31:30,435",Woody!
615,"00:31:37,320","00:31:39,959","I'd like
to join your posse, boys."
616,"00:31:40,120","00:31:42,270","But first, I'm gonna sing
a little song."
617,"00:31:48,400","00:31:49,992","Grandma, look what I found."
618,"00:31:50,160","00:31:51,991","- Can I take it to the park?
- Sure."
619,"00:31:52,160","00:31:54,833","Mom, she has enough toys
from the store."
620,"00:31:55,000","00:31:58,151","Oh, it's fine.
Nobody buys the toys anyway."
621,"00:31:58,320","00:32:00,038","Thanks, Grandma!"
622,"00:32:02,160","00:32:03,912",Yee-haw!
623,"00:32:04,960","00:32:06,632","Mom, can we go
to the carnival?"
624,"00:32:06,720","00:32:08,240","We're going
to the park."
625,"00:32:08,320","00:32:09,320","Maybe later, sweetie."
626,"00:32:16,560","00:32:17,675",Any sign of Woody?
627,"00:32:17,840","00:32:19,068","- I don't see him!
- Shh!"
628,"00:32:21,480","00:32:23,136","Maybe we should
have gone with the fork."
629,"00:32:23,160","00:32:24,160",The spoon is safer.
630,"00:32:24,480","00:32:25,480",Mmm.
631,"00:32:28,720","00:32:30,392",Forky?
632,"00:32:30,840","00:32:31,909",Where's Forky?
633,"00:32:33,320","00:32:34,320",Mom! Dad!
634,"00:32:34,400","00:32:35,696","- What's wrong, honey?
- Are you okay?"
635,"00:32:35,720","00:32:37,631","I can't find Forky!
He's missing!"
636,"00:32:37,800","00:32:39,199","Oh, Bonnie,
it'll be all right."
637,"00:32:39,360","00:32:41,032",I'm sure he's here somewhere.
638,"00:32:41,200","00:32:42,440","You know,
if you don't find him,"
639,"00:32:42,520","00:32:43,520",you can make a new one.
640,"00:32:43,680","00:32:45,796",No! There's only one Forky!
641,"00:32:45,880","00:32:47,029",Uh...
642,"00:32:47,120","00:32:48,394",Let's go look outside.
643,"00:32:48,480","00:32:49,960","Maybe he fell on the ground
somewhere."
644,"00:32:50,600","00:32:51,669","Oh, poor Bonnie."
645,"00:32:51,760","00:32:52,976","We're gonna
find him, okay?"
646,"00:32:53,000","00:32:55,389","We have to find him,
Mom. He needs me."
647,"00:32:55,480","00:32:56,595",Woody was right.
648,"00:32:56,760","00:32:58,796","We all should have been
safeguarding the utensil."
649,"00:32:58,960","00:33:00,154",Why isn't Woody back yet?
650,"00:33:00,240","00:33:01,440","Do you think
he's lost?"
651,"00:33:01,520","00:33:03,136","- Buzz, what do we do?
- What do we do, Buzz?"
652,"00:33:03,160","00:33:04,760","Buzz, what do we do?
What do we do, Buzz?"
653,"00:33:04,920","00:33:06,440","- What do we do, Buzz? Buzz!
- I, uh..."
654,"00:33:06,560","00:33:08,039","- Buzz.
- What would Woody do?"
655,"00:33:08,200","00:33:09,720","Eh, jump out
of a moving vehicle."
656,"00:33:09,880","00:33:11,472",What would Woody do?
657,"00:33:12,800","00:33:13,856",It's a secret mission
658,"00:33:13,880","00:33:15,438",in uncharted space. Let's go!
659,"00:33:15,760","00:33:18,228",I think I have to go.
660,"00:33:18,400","00:33:19,456","- Where?
- Where you goin'? Why?"
661,"00:33:19,480","00:33:20,480",Should we all go?
662,"00:33:20,600","00:33:21,656","- Are we going?
- And then what?"
663,"00:33:21,680","00:33:23,160","No time to explain!
Attack!"
664,"00:33:23,240","00:33:24,514",No time to explain!
665,"00:33:24,760","00:33:25,875","- Oh, no!
- Buzz!"
666,"00:33:26,040","00:33:28,040","Okay, what is with everyone
jumping out the window?"
667,"00:33:36,480","00:33:38,710","Woody and Forky were last seen
on the highway."
668,"00:33:38,880","00:33:40,393",But where is the highway?
669,"00:33:40,920","00:33:42,896","The slingshot
maneuver is all we've got!"
670,"00:33:42,920","00:33:44,353",Full speed ahead!
671,"00:33:47,120","00:33:48,519","Thanks, inner voice!"
672,"00:33:55,160","00:33:56,195",Hi-ya!
673,"00:33:59,440","00:34:00,440",The highway.
674,"00:34:01,240","00:34:02,639","On my way, Woody!"
675,"00:34:21,040","00:34:22,268",Rad.
676,"00:34:23,760","00:34:25,079",Hey! Step right up!
677,"00:34:25,240","00:34:26,240",Put your money down!
678,"00:34:26,320","00:34:27,416","Get yourself
a real Buzz Lightyear!"
679,"00:34:27,440","00:34:28,953",Hey! Hey!
680,"00:34:34,440","00:34:36,556","Harmony, honey. Sunscreen."
681,"00:34:36,760","00:34:37,760",Okay.
682,"00:34:37,920","00:34:39,990","Be right back, Mr. Cowboy."
683,"00:34:48,280","00:34:50,919","Okay. Antique store,
antique store..."
684,"00:34:51,080","00:34:52,080","Oh, that way!"
685,"00:35:10,600","00:35:12,716","Did you see 'em?
How many are there?"
686,"00:35:12,800","00:35:15,075","- Whoa, whoa.
- We got a busload of campers!"
687,"00:35:15,160","00:35:17,116",Here they come!
688,"00:35:17,280","00:35:18,840","- Huh?
- Playtime, baby!"
689,"00:35:31,600","00:35:33,875","Oh, baby!
It's a good day to play, huh?"
690,"00:35:34,040","00:35:35,155",Am I right?
691,"00:35:38,560","00:35:39,595",Huh?
692,"00:35:48,520","00:35:51,592","""Hello, Mr. Cowboy.
How are you today?"
693,"00:35:51,680","00:35:53,557","""Do you like riding horses?"""
694,"00:36:03,520","00:36:05,158","Wanna play
on the swings?"
695,"00:36:05,440","00:36:06,440",Wait for me!
696,"00:36:07,840","00:36:09,114",Bo?
697,"00:36:09,200","00:36:10,235",Come on.
698,"00:36:19,600","00:36:20,600",Bo!
699,"00:36:20,680","00:36:22,160","Oh, I can't
believe it's you!"
700,"00:36:22,240","00:36:23,593",Bo Peep!
701,"00:36:23,680","00:36:25,318","I never thought
I'd see you again!"
702,"00:36:29,880","00:36:31,576","- So, which kid is yours?
- Which one is yours?"
703,"00:36:31,600","00:36:32,715","- None.
- No one."
704,"00:36:32,800","00:36:34,950","- Wait, you're a lost toy?
- You're a lost toy?"
705,"00:36:35,120","00:36:36,320","- That's awful.
- That's great."
706,"00:36:36,760","00:36:39,069","- Huh?
- I mean, awfully great..."
707,"00:36:39,240","00:36:41,993",that you are lost out here.
708,"00:36:42,160","00:36:44,200","- Skunk, skunk, skunk!
- Watch out!"
709,"00:36:45,320","00:36:47,276",Huh?
710,"00:36:49,240","00:36:50,832","I told you
not to drive so fast."
711,"00:36:51,000","00:36:52,194",You almost ran him over.
712,"00:36:54,240","00:36:55,434","Oh, hey, guys!"
713,"00:36:55,600","00:36:56,794",Whoa! Hold on there!
714,"00:36:56,960","00:36:58,757","Okay!
I missed you, too."
715,"00:36:58,920","00:37:01,832","If it isn't Bobby?
Gus?"
716,"00:37:01,920","00:37:02,955",Uh...
717,"00:37:03,040","00:37:04,109",Lefty?
718,"00:37:04,320","00:37:05,435","Billy, Goat, and Gruff."
719,"00:37:05,600","00:37:07,272","Right! Right! Right!
Sorry, guys."
720,"00:37:07,440","00:37:09,112","- Girls.
- Girls! Of course!"
721,"00:37:10,400","00:37:11,600","All right, all right."
722,"00:37:11,640","00:37:14,632","Okay, let's get a look at you.
You need any repairs?"
723,"00:37:14,800","00:37:16,756","Repairs? No, I'm fine."
724,"00:37:16,880","00:37:18,950","Hey! Nice find, girls."
725,"00:37:19,040","00:37:20,256","Where did you get
all this stuff?"
726,"00:37:20,280","00:37:21,280",Here and there.
727,"00:37:21,360","00:37:24,113","You know, some kids
play rougher than others..."
728,"00:37:24,280","00:37:25,872","so I try
to be prepared."
729,"00:37:26,040","00:37:27,560","How long have you been
out on your own?"
730,"00:37:27,680","00:37:29,352",Seven fantastic years!
731,"00:37:29,520","00:37:30,555",Seven?
732,"00:37:30,720","00:37:33,029","You would not believe
the things I've seen."
733,"00:37:33,120","00:37:34,348","Uh, no."
734,"00:37:34,560","00:37:35,595","- Gigs.
- Yo!"
735,"00:37:35,760","00:37:37,640","Come on out. There's someone
I want you to meet."
736,"00:37:38,040","00:37:39,189",Be right down.
737,"00:37:43,600","00:37:46,068","What's the situation?
We heading out of town or..."
738,"00:37:46,280","00:37:47,508",Whoa! Who's this?
739,"00:37:47,680","00:37:49,360","You remember the rag doll
I told you about?"
740,"00:37:49,520","00:37:50,635","- The cowboy?
- Yep!"
741,"00:37:50,800","00:37:53,473",No way!
742,"00:37:54,840","00:37:56,800","- Don't stare.
- I'm totally staring."
743,"00:37:57,200","00:37:59,475","Woody,
this is Giggle McDimples."
744,"00:38:00,920","00:38:01,920","Oh, hi, Giggle."
745,"00:38:02,080","00:38:03,877","Whoa, you didn't tell me
he was a cop."
746,"00:38:04,040","00:38:05,189","Howdy, Sheriff."
747,"00:38:05,360","00:38:06,839",Officer Giggle McDimples.
748,"00:38:06,920","00:38:08,751","I run Pet Patrol
for Mini-Opolis."
749,"00:38:08,920","00:38:09,955","Yeah, search and rescue."
750,"00:38:10,120","00:38:11,120","Ants, caterpillars,"
751,"00:38:11,200","00:38:12,896","- miniature poodles, spiders.
- Hut! Hut! Hut!"
752,"00:38:12,920","00:38:14,512",Carl! Where you headed?
753,"00:38:14,680","00:38:16,456","Combat Carl just heard
there's a birthday party..."
754,"00:38:16,480","00:38:17,913","at the playground
on Main Street."
755,"00:38:18,080","00:38:19,672","Rumor has it
they got two piñatas."
756,"00:38:19,840","00:38:22,070","- That could be 20 to 30 kids.
- Nice!"
757,"00:38:22,360","00:38:24,999","Oh, yeah! Combat Carl's
gettin' played with!"
758,"00:38:25,680","00:38:26,680",You guys in?
759,"00:38:26,840","00:38:29,354","You bet! Woody,
you are gonna love this!"
760,"00:38:29,720","00:38:31,312","Uh, no, I can't, sir."
761,"00:38:31,480","00:38:33,152","Bo, I need to get back
to my kid."
762,"00:38:33,240","00:38:34,832","- What?
- You got a kid?"
763,"00:38:34,920","00:38:36,035",Yeah.
764,"00:38:36,120","00:38:37,800","Way to beat
the odds, soldier."
765,"00:38:38,400","00:38:39,680","Meet you
at the playground, Peep."
766,"00:38:39,840","00:38:42,434","Combat Carl's got
a piñata party to crash."
767,"00:38:42,600","00:38:44,795","All right, move out.
Hut! Hut! Hut!"
768,"00:38:45,880","00:38:48,348","So, you're, uh, with a kid?"
769,"00:38:48,560","00:38:49,560","It's not Andy, is it?"
770,"00:38:49,760","00:38:51,671","No, no, no.
He went off to college."
771,"00:38:51,840","00:38:53,637",But he gave us to Bonnie.
772,"00:38:53,800","00:38:55,631","- You have a little girl?
- No way!"
773,"00:38:55,800","00:38:57,199","Yeah, yeah.
It's why I'm out here."
774,"00:38:57,360","00:38:58,679",Her other toy is trapped
775,"00:38:58,760","00:38:59,976","in this antique store,
and I have to..."
776,"00:39:00,000","00:39:01,752",Second Chance Antiques?
777,"00:39:01,920","00:39:03,148",We know that store.
778,"00:39:03,360","00:39:04,759",That's great. That is great!
779,"00:39:04,840","00:39:06,478","If you know the store,
you could really"
780,"00:39:06,560","00:39:07,760","- help me find him...
- No way."
781,"00:39:07,920","00:39:08,920","We wasted years there,"
782,"00:39:09,000","00:39:10,616","just sitting on the shelf,
collecting dust."
783,"00:39:10,640","00:39:12,119","Oh, Bo, that's awful."
784,"00:39:12,280","00:39:13,349",But I don't have a choice.
785,"00:39:13,440","00:39:15,158","I have to get that toy
from Gabby."
786,"00:39:15,360","00:39:16,873","Whoa. Steer clear
of that weirdo."
787,"00:39:17,080","00:39:19,310","If I were you, I'd cut
my losses and go home."
788,"00:39:19,480","00:39:21,516","But Bonnie needs him
to get through kindergarten."
789,"00:39:21,680","00:39:23,910","Kids lose toys every day.
Bonnie will get over it."
790,"00:39:24,080","00:39:25,559","No, no..."
791,"00:39:25,720","00:39:29,269","You see, Bonnie needs him
just like Molly needed you."
792,"00:39:30,920","00:39:32,239","Aw, no. Sorry, girls."
793,"00:39:32,320","00:39:33,760",Molly's not here.
794,"00:39:33,800","00:39:35,711","Molly? Bo,
I didn't know you had a kid."
795,"00:39:35,880","00:39:37,711",That was a long time ago.
796,"00:39:37,880","00:39:39,996","Oh, Bo's kid was
something special."
797,"00:39:40,160","00:39:41,798",She was the cutest thing...
798,"00:39:41,960","00:39:43,598",but so afraid of the dark.
799,"00:39:44,000","00:39:45,353",It was just a phase.
800,"00:39:45,520","00:39:46,936","Oh, you weren't there
in the beginning."
801,"00:39:46,960","00:39:48,871","Hearing Molly cry
each night..."
802,"00:39:49,040","00:39:51,190",it broke every toy's heart.
803,"00:39:51,960","00:39:54,633","And then,
Bo came into the room."
804,"00:39:54,800","00:39:58,588","Her lamp was the only thing
that made Molly feel safe."
805,"00:39:58,760","00:40:00,751","Mom would let her keep Bo on
all night."
806,"00:40:00,840","00:40:02,717","Ha! Who knew you were
such a softy?"
807,"00:40:02,920","00:40:04,148",And Molly would fall asleep
808,"00:40:04,240","00:40:06,310","with her hand
resting on Bo's feet."
809,"00:40:06,480","00:40:08,630",Okay! Okay. I get it.
810,"00:40:10,120","00:40:12,554","Bo, my kid really needs
this toy."
811,"00:40:13,400","00:40:16,392","Will you help me?
For old times' sake."
812,"00:40:18,120","00:40:19,633","All right, all right."
813,"00:40:19,800","00:40:21,392",Thank you! Oh!
814,"00:40:21,520","00:40:22,640","- Oh, thank you!
- All right."
815,"00:40:22,760","00:40:24,512","Guess we're doing this.
Let's ride!"
816,"00:40:27,360","00:40:29,999","Second Chance Antiques,
and step on it."
817,"00:40:47,080","00:40:48,877",Ow!
818,"00:40:51,280","00:40:52,508","Hey, hey!"
819,"00:40:53,440","00:40:54,936","- Benson, are we finished?
- Ow!"
820,"00:40:54,960","00:40:56,552","Oh, that feels great!"
821,"00:40:56,760","00:40:58,318",Look at that! Good as new.
822,"00:40:58,480","00:41:00,948","Yeah. Thank you, uh, Benson."
823,"00:41:02,720","00:41:05,029","Uh, so, um, when's Woody
coming back?"
824,"00:41:05,200","00:41:06,872","Like I said, soon."
825,"00:41:07,040","00:41:08,234",He won't forget about you.
826,"00:41:08,440","00:41:09,440",How do you know?
827,"00:41:09,600","00:41:12,114","You have your child's name
written on your feet."
828,"00:41:12,320","00:41:13,320",Sticks.
829,"00:41:13,480","00:41:15,675","That makes you
a very important toy."
830,"00:41:15,840","00:41:17,398","That's exactly
what Woody says."
831,"00:41:17,960","00:41:19,456",Hmm. Interesting.
832,"00:41:19,480","00:41:20,656","Hi, Grandma!
We're back!"
833,"00:41:20,680","00:41:21,680",She's back.
834,"00:41:23,200","00:41:24,200",Who is she?
835,"00:41:25,320","00:41:26,320",Harmony.
836,"00:41:26,480","00:41:27,480",Wait a second...
837,"00:41:27,640","00:41:28,868",she took Woody.
838,"00:41:29,040","00:41:30,314",Did she lose him?
839,"00:41:30,480","00:41:33,392",No. My Harmony is perfect.
840,"00:41:38,480","00:41:39,656","Forky, it's tea time.
It's tea time."
841,"00:41:39,680","00:41:42,717","- Whoo-hoo! What is tea time?
- Oh, I'll show you."
842,"00:41:44,880","00:41:47,155","A little bit of milk,
two lumps of sugar."
843,"00:41:54,160","00:41:56,276","I've been practicing.
How do I look?"
844,"00:41:57,840","00:41:58,955",Uh... A little higher.
845,"00:41:59,800","00:42:00,994",Stick out your pinky.
846,"00:42:01,400","00:42:02,400",Nice!
847,"00:42:03,120","00:42:04,348",Mmm! Delicious!
848,"00:42:04,520","00:42:06,280","Harmony, sweetie, I'm leaving."
849,"00:42:06,360","00:42:07,588",Come give me a hug.
850,"00:42:07,760","00:42:09,671","Bye, Mom.
I love you."
851,"00:42:23,040","00:42:25,031",When my voice box is fixed...
852,"00:42:26,560","00:42:28,994",I'll finally get my chance.
853,"00:42:41,480","00:42:43,869","Now, about our friend Woody."
854,"00:42:44,080","00:42:46,514","I wanna know
everything about him."
855,"00:42:46,840","00:42:47,840","Oh, yeah, Woody."
856,"00:42:47,960","00:42:49,791","I've known that guy
my whole life. Two days!"
857,"00:42:50,000","00:42:52,230","Hey, did you know that
Bonnie was not his first kid?"
858,"00:42:52,400","00:42:54,311","He had this other kid, Andy."
859,"00:42:54,400","00:42:55,400",And you know what?
860,"00:42:55,480","00:42:57,040","I don't think
he's ever gotten over him."
861,"00:43:08,640","00:43:10,312","Psst. Hey, Lightyear."
862,"00:43:10,760","00:43:12,079","Hey, up here,
Astro-boy."
863,"00:43:12,240","00:43:13,832","If you think you can
just show up"
864,"00:43:13,920","00:43:15,717",and take our top prize spot...
865,"00:43:15,880","00:43:17,000","- you're wrong!
- Dead wrong!"
866,"00:43:17,120","00:43:18,712","You don't understand.
I'm trying to..."
867,"00:43:18,880","00:43:20,880","Cheat the system and get
with a kid? Yeah, we know."
868,"00:43:20,920","00:43:22,319","No, I need..."
869,"00:43:22,480","00:43:24,311","A child to shower you
with unconditional love?"
870,"00:43:24,480","00:43:26,516","- Join the club, pal.
- Yeah, join the club!"
871,"00:43:26,680","00:43:28,159","Come on,
help me get outta here."
872,"00:43:28,320","00:43:30,072",I'll help you. With my foot!
873,"00:43:30,240","00:43:31,639",Get him.
874,"00:43:31,720","00:43:33,392",Get him.
875,"00:43:33,560","00:43:34,696","- Bunny, what are you doing?
- Hmm?"
876,"00:43:34,720","00:43:37,075","I can't reach him.
Help me out here, come on."
877,"00:43:37,360","00:43:39,176","Oh, sorry, Ducky. I'm not
a mind reader, you know."
878,"00:43:39,200","00:43:40,952","What's not to understand, hmm?"
879,"00:43:41,120","00:43:42,120",You gonna make me say it?
880,"00:43:42,280","00:43:43,872",What?
881,"00:43:43,960","00:43:46,394","With these tiny legs, I cannot
reach without your help."
882,"00:43:46,480","00:43:47,629","Uh-huh. Okay?
This is what"
883,"00:43:47,720","00:43:48,920","I've been talking about,
Bunny."
884,"00:43:48,960","00:43:50,176","You need to work
on paying attention"
885,"00:43:50,200","00:43:51,296",and your listening skills.
886,"00:43:51,320","00:43:52,435",Ha!
887,"00:43:52,520","00:43:54,192","How you like that, cheater?
Huh?"
888,"00:43:54,360","00:43:56,749",Yeah!
889,"00:43:56,840","00:44:00,071","Oh, to infinity and my foot!
Boom!"
890,"00:44:00,280","00:44:02,669","In a galaxy far, far away,
you got kicked in the head!"
891,"00:44:02,760","00:44:03,760",Boom!
892,"00:44:03,840","00:44:05,273",How do I get out of here?
893,"00:44:05,560","00:44:06,834",This planet is toxic.
894,"00:44:07,000","00:44:08,672","Closing helmet
to conserve oxygen."
895,"00:44:08,840","00:44:10,816","In the vacuum of space,
they cannot hear you scream!"
896,"00:44:10,840","00:44:12,114",Ow!
897,"00:44:12,200","00:44:13,200",Let go of me!
898,"00:44:13,360","00:44:14,554",Get off of me!
899,"00:44:15,600","00:44:16,936","Ooh! So, that's what
gravity feel like."
900,"00:44:16,960","00:44:17,960","Yeah, that's it."
901,"00:44:18,040","00:44:19,040","Hey, where you going?"
902,"00:44:20,720","00:44:22,056","You better get
over here, spaceman!"
903,"00:44:22,080","00:44:23,798","Yeah, put us
back up there!"
904,"00:44:23,960","00:44:25,656","Bunny, what are you doing?
He's getting away, let's go!"
905,"00:44:25,680","00:44:26,680","- I'm trying!
- Come on!"
906,"00:44:29,200","00:44:31,191","Antique store, here we come!"
907,"00:44:31,360","00:44:33,112","Bo, why do you ride around
in a skunk?"
908,"00:44:33,200","00:44:35,077",Whoa! Skunk!
909,"00:44:35,240","00:44:36,389",A skunk!
910,"00:44:36,560","00:44:38,152","Oh, I get it. Smart."
911,"00:44:38,360","00:44:39,839","Corndogs, corndogs, corndogs!"
912,"00:44:46,360","00:44:47,560",Why are you so bad at driving?
913,"00:44:47,720","00:44:49,517",You got six eyes.
914,"00:44:49,800","00:44:51,472",Thanks for the landing.
915,"00:44:51,560","00:44:54,120","- Uh...
- Come on, follow me."
916,"00:44:59,920","00:45:00,976","- I'm fine.
- His face!"
917,"00:45:01,000","00:45:02,416","- That's hilarious.
- I'm fine. Don't worry."
918,"00:45:02,440","00:45:03,919",Happens all the time.
919,"00:45:04,080","00:45:05,080",Tape!
920,"00:45:05,400","00:45:06,515",Not a bad hiding spot.
921,"00:45:06,720","00:45:07,914","Yeah.
Leave the skunk."
922,"00:45:08,080","00:45:09,520","- We'll fix it later.
- 10-4."
923,"00:45:09,560","00:45:11,232",This will be more fun.
924,"00:45:11,400","00:45:12,753",Let's get you to that store!
925,"00:45:14,240","00:45:16,310","Okay, spill it.
The cowboy, what's the deal?"
926,"00:45:16,520","00:45:17,839","- There's no deal.
- Uh-huh."
927,"00:45:18,000","00:45:20,070","Don't do this to yourself.
Cowboy's got a kid."
928,"00:45:20,240","00:45:22,310","- Giggle...
- Trust me. I've been there."
929,"00:45:22,480","00:45:24,596","You know about me and He-Man.
I'm not proud."
930,"00:45:24,680","00:45:26,033",Shh! Here he comes!
931,"00:45:26,160","00:45:27,718","- Oh, man...
- What?"
932,"00:45:27,800","00:45:29,153","No, not you."
933,"00:45:29,320","00:45:31,117","Second Chance Antiques,
straight ahead."
934,"00:45:31,440","00:45:32,656","Heavy foot traffic
at the entrance."
935,"00:45:32,680","00:45:34,193",Easiest way in is
936,"00:45:34,280","00:45:35,480","- the roof.
- The roof!"
937,"00:45:36,240","00:45:38,231",Let's go antiquing.
938,"00:45:42,120","00:45:43,120",Hold on!
939,"00:45:43,680","00:45:44,795",Huh?
940,"00:45:45,560","00:45:46,675",Whoa!
941,"00:45:46,760","00:45:47,988",How did you end up here?
942,"00:45:48,160","00:45:49,736","I thought you were given
to a new family."
943,"00:45:49,760","00:45:50,909","Oh, you know how it goes."
944,"00:45:51,080","00:45:52,195",Their little girl grew up
945,"00:45:52,280","00:45:54,953","and didn't need me anymore,
so..."
946,"00:45:55,040","00:45:56,473","Oh, I'm sorry, Bo."
947,"00:45:56,640","00:45:58,471","Eh, who needs a kid's room..."
948,"00:45:58,640","00:46:02,633",when you can have all of this?
949,"00:46:15,160","00:46:16,513","Whatcha looking at, Sheriff?"
950,"00:46:16,680","00:46:17,954","What? Oh, uh..."
951,"00:46:18,360","00:46:20,271","That wasn't...
No, uh, nothing."
952,"00:46:21,160","00:46:22,798","I was looking at the store.
Right there."
953,"00:46:22,880","00:46:24,552","I was looking
at the antique store."
954,"00:46:24,760","00:46:26,591","- Giggle, count us down.
- Five."
955,"00:46:26,720","00:46:27,840","- Countdown for what?
- Four."
956,"00:46:27,920","00:46:29,176","You want to get to the store,
don't you?"
957,"00:46:29,200","00:46:30,200",Three. Two. One!
958,"00:46:41,760","00:46:43,751","The highway exit
has to be somewhere."
959,"00:46:43,920","00:46:45,273",Where is it?
960,"00:46:45,440","00:46:47,476",Meteor shower! Look out!
961,"00:46:47,840","00:46:48,840",Woody?
962,"00:46:49,480","00:46:50,993","Good work, inner voice."
963,"00:46:51,520","00:46:53,511","So, how about you?
How's your new kid?"
964,"00:46:53,680","00:46:56,069","Bonnie?
Oh, she's great."
965,"00:46:56,240","00:46:57,275",Jessie is loving it.
966,"00:46:57,440","00:46:58,440",Jessie's still with you?
967,"00:46:58,600","00:47:00,636","Oh, yeah, the whole gang's
still together."
968,"00:47:00,800","00:47:02,313","Well, I mean, most of us."
969,"00:47:04,720","00:47:05,720",What about Rex?
970,"00:47:05,920","00:47:07,911","Yeah, yeah, Rex,
Bullseye, Slinky..."
971,"00:47:08,080","00:47:09,752","- the Potato Heads...
- Buzz?"
972,"00:47:09,920","00:47:10,989","Yeah, Buzz, too."
973,"00:47:11,160","00:47:13,958","I cannot wait to see his face
when he hears that I found..."
974,"00:47:14,120","00:47:15,872","- Bo Peep?
- Buzz!"
975,"00:47:16,040","00:47:17,678","- My old moving buddy!
- Buzz?"
976,"00:47:17,760","00:47:18,829",It's so good to see you!
977,"00:47:19,000","00:47:20,035","Woody, it's Bo Peep!"
978,"00:47:20,200","00:47:22,280","- What are you doing here?
- What are you doing here?"
979,"00:47:23,720","00:47:24,776",Buzz... Buzz... Buzz...
980,"00:47:24,800","00:47:25,856",Buzz Lightyear to the rescue!
981,"00:47:25,880","00:47:27,199","- Three years!
- Three years!"
982,"00:47:27,320","00:47:28,360",That's how long we've been
983,"00:47:28,400","00:47:29,656","hanging up there
waiting for a kid!"
984,"00:47:29,680","00:47:30,760","Look, I'm sorry about that."
985,"00:47:30,920","00:47:32,797","You ruined our lives.
Shame on you!"
986,"00:47:32,880","00:47:34,552",Who are these guys?
987,"00:47:34,720","00:47:36,520","- Lightyear promised us a kid.
- You did what?"
988,"00:47:36,560","00:47:37,976",I did not.
989,"00:47:38,000","00:47:39,616","- Hey! Wait a minute!
- Eat my plush!"
990,"00:47:39,640","00:47:40,776","All right now,
come on, stop it!"
991,"00:47:40,800","00:47:41,800",Cut it out now!
992,"00:47:42,000","00:47:43,080","Come on, guys, break it up."
993,"00:47:43,160","00:47:44,160","Guys, I have a kid!"
994,"00:47:44,360","00:47:46,430",You got a kid?
995,"00:47:46,600","00:47:47,600",Like a kid-kid?
996,"00:47:47,800","00:47:49,916","Like a human kid,
not a baby goat?"
997,"00:47:50,080","00:47:52,036","Yeah. Now let go of Buzz
and come with me."
998,"00:47:52,200","00:47:53,269",I'll take you to Bonnie.
999,"00:47:53,440","00:47:54,839","- We're gettin' a kid?
- Yes!"
1000,"00:47:54,920","00:47:56,096",We're gettin' a kid?
1001,"00:47:56,120","00:47:57,951","- We're gonna get a kid
- Kid"
1002,"00:47:58,040","00:47:59,576","- We're getting a kid
- All right, let's go."
1003,"00:47:59,600","00:48:01,096","- We gonna get something, oh
- We gonna uh, uh, uh"
1004,"00:48:01,120","00:48:03,270","- Where's Forky?
- Long story."
1005,"00:48:03,480","00:48:05,914","- Kid, we get a kid
- Kid, kid, kid"
1006,"00:48:06,400","00:48:08,550","- We gonna kid
- We gonna kid, kid"
1007,"00:48:10,600","00:48:11,874",He's not anywhere.
1008,"00:48:12,520","00:48:14,511",Forky's gone.
1009,"00:48:14,680","00:48:16,193","Oh, honey, I'm sorry."
1010,"00:48:16,360","00:48:18,749","Okay. Let's look outside
one more time."
1011,"00:48:18,920","00:48:21,559","But then we have to keep
driving, okay?"
1012,"00:48:24,720","00:48:26,199",They're about to leave!
1013,"00:48:26,360","00:48:27,856","- Leaving?
- They can't do that!"
1014,"00:48:27,880","00:48:29,836",The panic is attacking me!
1015,"00:48:29,920","00:48:31,911","- Hey! Watch it, buddy!
- What do we do?"
1016,"00:48:32,080","00:48:33,399","- We have to stop them!
- How?"
1017,"00:48:33,480","00:48:36,040","We could frame Dad for
a crime so he goes to jail."
1018,"00:48:36,200","00:48:38,589","Or go back in time and warn
Woody about the future."
1019,"00:48:38,760","00:48:39,896","That's crazy.
Time is a flat circle."
1020,"00:48:39,920","00:48:40,920",Jessie!
1021,"00:48:44,880","00:48:46,233","I'm sorry, Bonnie."
1022,"00:48:46,360","00:48:47,360",We looked everywhere.
1023,"00:48:47,440","00:48:48,736","But we need
to get going now, okay?"
1024,"00:48:48,760","00:48:50,176","Can we please leave a note
for Forky..."
1025,"00:48:50,200","00:48:51,679",so he knows where we're going?
1026,"00:48:51,840","00:48:53,956",He has to go to kindergarten.
1027,"00:48:54,360","00:48:55,509",Huh?
1028,"00:48:57,000","00:48:58,991","Are you kidding me?
I can't..."
1029,"00:48:59,720","00:49:02,678","Everything is going perfect...
I just bought it."
1030,"00:49:03,000","00:49:04,776","Okay! Daddy's
going to use some words."
1031,"00:49:04,800","00:49:06,279","How about we go
to the carnival?"
1032,"00:49:06,440","00:49:09,079","Or maybe check out
some of those shops in town?"
1033,"00:49:10,120","00:49:11,473",What did you do?
1034,"00:49:11,640","00:49:14,837","We're not going anywhere.
If you get my point."
1035,"00:49:15,000","00:49:16,056","- Brilliant!
- That was genius!"
1036,"00:49:16,080","00:49:17,080","Nice work, Jessie!"
1037,"00:49:18,880","00:49:21,080","I'm sure Buzz and Woody are on
their way back right now."
1038,"00:49:22,360","00:49:23,475",Whoa!
1039,"00:49:25,240","00:49:26,240",Forky is in there?
1040,"00:49:26,320","00:49:27,320",Yeah.
1041,"00:49:27,440","00:49:28,496","Now, hold on.
I have a question."
1042,"00:49:28,520","00:49:31,034","Who will Bonnie love more?
Ducky or me? Say me."
1043,"00:49:31,200","00:49:32,720","- No, say Ducky. Ducky.
- Bunny. Bunny."
1044,"00:49:32,840","00:49:33,960","Okay, guys.
Playtime is over."
1045,"00:49:34,000","00:49:35,353",You have to follow my lead.
1046,"00:49:35,520","00:49:38,034","We stay together,
we stay quiet. Are we clear?"
1047,"00:49:38,240","00:49:39,798","Absolutely.
Lead the way."
1048,"00:50:01,640","00:50:02,960","- Are you kidding me?
- Move over."
1049,"00:50:03,040","00:50:04,176","- You move over.
- Quit pushing me."
1050,"00:50:04,200","00:50:05,474","- Stop.
- Shh!"
1051,"00:50:05,560","00:50:07,630","Oh, my maker!
That sheep has three heads!"
1052,"00:50:07,720","00:50:08,720","No, no, no!"
1053,"00:50:08,800","00:50:11,189","What? All six eyes
just looked into my soul."
1054,"00:50:11,400","00:50:12,628",Gonna have nightmares.
1055,"00:50:17,560","00:50:20,028","That's most likely where
your Forky is being kept."
1056,"00:50:20,920","00:50:22,296","All right,
this isn't so bad."
1057,"00:50:22,320","00:50:24,276","We just can't be seen
by the dummies."
1058,"00:50:24,440","00:50:25,714",Not just the dummies.
1059,"00:50:25,880","00:50:29,316","Her cabinet is surrounded
by a moat of exposed aisle."
1060,"00:50:29,480","00:50:31,675",Where Dragon roams.
1061,"00:50:33,000","00:50:34,149","- We can handle a cat.
- No."
1062,"00:50:34,320","00:50:35,548",Not this one.
1063,"00:50:39,200","00:50:41,873","Is that how we look
on the inside?"
1064,"00:50:42,040","00:50:44,270","- There's so much...
- fluff."
1065,"00:50:44,440","00:50:45,816","So, how do you propose
we get up there?"
1066,"00:50:45,840","00:50:47,558",We could go straight across.
1067,"00:50:47,720","00:50:49,392","- How?
- That's quite a jump."
1068,"00:50:49,560","00:50:51,437","We know the perfect toy
to help."
1069,"00:50:51,600","00:50:52,896","Oh, Bonnie, check it out."
1070,"00:50:52,920","00:50:54,760","- Look at all this cool stuff.
- Bonnie?"
1071,"00:50:55,080","00:50:56,433","We gotta get
Forky now!"
1072,"00:50:56,520","00:50:57,794","Woody, don't..."
1073,"00:50:57,960","00:50:59,359","- Stick to the plan.
- 10-4."
1074,"00:50:59,440","00:51:01,158","- Follow me.
- Roger that."
1075,"00:51:06,440","00:51:08,874","Woody just sits in the closet?
With no playtime?"
1076,"00:51:09,080","00:51:11,275","Yeah, he told me himself,
he's useless."
1077,"00:51:11,440","00:51:12,509",That's awful.
1078,"00:51:12,680","00:51:13,999",Such pretty hair...
1079,"00:51:14,600","00:51:15,715",What are you doing?
1080,"00:51:15,920","00:51:17,120",You need to stick to the plan.
1081,"00:51:17,160","00:51:18,593","But it's Bonnie.
She's right..."
1082,"00:51:18,800","00:51:20,320","Can we go
to the carnival, too?"
1083,"00:51:20,440","00:51:21,440",...there.
1084,"00:51:21,520","00:51:23,511",Come on. Stay quiet.
1085,"00:51:23,720","00:51:25,233","You better hope
the dummies didn't..."
1086,"00:51:28,880","00:51:30,108",Whoa!
1087,"00:52:03,560","00:52:05,073",My sheep!
1088,"00:52:12,320","00:52:14,390","What did I say?
I lead. You follow."
1089,"00:52:14,560","00:52:17,233","Bo, I'm so sorry. Really.
Just tell me how to help."
1090,"00:52:17,440","00:52:18,509",You really wanna help?
1091,"00:52:18,600","00:52:21,114","Then stay out of my way.
I'm getting my sheep back."
1092,"00:52:21,360","00:52:22,360",What about the others?
1093,"00:52:22,520","00:52:23,953",Giggle knows what to do.
1094,"00:52:27,120","00:52:29,160","- Here you go.
- That's our objective."
1095,"00:52:29,240","00:52:31,117",We have to get that key.
1096,"00:52:31,280","00:52:32,696","It's the only way
inside the cabinet."
1097,"00:52:32,720","00:52:34,073",You can't be serious.
1098,"00:52:34,160","00:52:35,360","How are we supposed
to do that?"
1099,"00:52:35,520","00:52:36,748",Okay.
1100,"00:52:36,960","00:52:38,200","You know what,
leave that to us."
1101,"00:52:38,360","00:52:40,316","- We know exactly what to do.
- Mmm-hmm."
1102,"00:52:42,360","00:52:43,395",Aw.
1103,"00:52:43,480","00:52:45,311",Where did you two come from?
1104,"00:52:45,480","00:52:47,710","The keys! Give 'em
up now! Where are they?"
1105,"00:52:47,880","00:52:49,240","Give us the keys!
Give us the keys!"
1106,"00:52:49,920","00:52:51,000","Well, we're not doing that."
1107,"00:52:51,160","00:52:52,296","Yeah, yeah, I agree,
too visible."
1108,"00:52:52,320","00:52:53,696","It's a good point.
Something more subtle."
1109,"00:52:53,720","00:52:55,216","Ooh, what about ""Winner,
winner, chicken dinner""?"
1110,"00:52:55,240","00:52:56,240",Yes.
1111,"00:53:02,600","00:53:04,875","The keys! Give 'em
up now! Where are they?"
1112,"00:53:05,240","00:53:06,992","- Uh... you're kidding.
- Really?"
1113,"00:53:07,200","00:53:08,713","Okay, okay. You just..."
1114,"00:53:08,880","00:53:10,108",All right. Well...
1115,"00:53:10,200","00:53:12,156","Oh, what about the old
""Plush Rush""?"
1116,"00:53:12,320","00:53:13,355",There you go!
1117,"00:53:26,960","00:53:29,000","- Argh. Where is this going?
- Shh! Don't interrupt."
1118,"00:53:43,920","00:53:45,120","- Okay, right?
- Uh-huh?"
1119,"00:53:45,240","00:53:47,310","Not gonna happen.
N-O."
1120,"00:53:47,480","00:53:49,152","Okay, do you want
the key or not?"
1121,"00:53:49,240","00:53:50,480",What is wrong with you?
1122,"00:53:50,520","00:53:51,520",What is wrong with...?
1123,"00:53:51,600","00:53:53,636","We just gave you
three brilliant ideas."
1124,"00:53:53,720","00:53:55,073","It's one thing
to say no."
1125,"00:53:55,160","00:53:56,718","It's another to offer
a reason..."
1126,"00:53:56,920","00:53:58,319",How do we get that key?
1127,"00:54:04,720","00:54:06,153",You're kidding!
1128,"00:54:06,240","00:54:07,389",Really?
1129,"00:54:07,560","00:54:08,788",Woody's back?
1130,"00:54:08,880","00:54:09,995",Woody's back?
1131,"00:54:10,160","00:54:11,957","And you're sure it's Bo Peep
who's with him?"
1132,"00:54:13,440","00:54:14,440","Thank you, Benson."
1133,"00:54:14,640","00:54:15,840","Make sure the others
are ready."
1134,"00:54:17,760","00:54:18,909",Woody's back!
1135,"00:54:19,080","00:54:21,071","I'm coming, Bonnie!"
1136,"00:54:22,040","00:54:23,040",Bonnie.
1137,"00:54:23,120","00:54:25,156","First, we must prepare
for his arrival."
1138,"00:54:25,360","00:54:26,395",Prepare?
1139,"00:54:26,480","00:54:27,736","Have you ever played
hide-and-seek?"
1140,"00:54:27,760","00:54:29,876",No. But it sounds complicated.
1141,"00:54:30,040","00:54:31,040","Oh, it's easy."
1142,"00:54:31,240","00:54:32,673","- I'll teach you, okay?
- Okay."
1143,"00:54:32,840","00:54:34,273",The first thing you do is...
1144,"00:54:34,680","00:54:36,511","one of us finds a place
to hide..."
1145,"00:54:36,600","00:54:37,600",Scary.
1146,"00:54:37,680","00:54:39,136","...while
the other one counts to ten..."
1147,"00:54:39,160","00:54:40,752",then tries to find them.
1148,"00:54:58,800","00:55:00,233","- What are we doing?
- Shh!"
1149,"00:55:00,520","00:55:03,159",Just stand there and be quiet!
1150,"00:55:08,240","00:55:10,037",I'll do the talking.
1151,"00:55:11,320","00:55:13,072","Hi, Tinny!"
1152,"00:55:13,160","00:55:14,832","Aw, nice to see you, too."
1153,"00:55:16,120","00:55:17,917","Yeah, he's with me."
1154,"00:55:18,120","00:55:19,599","My friend? No, no, no."
1155,"00:55:19,760","00:55:21,512",He's my accessory.
1156,"00:55:21,760","00:55:23,478","- Hey, guys.
- Bo!"
1157,"00:55:23,640","00:55:25,710",Long time no see.
1158,"00:55:25,920","00:55:27,273","Couldn't take it
out there, huh?"
1159,"00:55:27,360","00:55:28,588","Hey, Doug.
Saw your better half"
1160,"00:55:28,720","00:55:29,789",at the front of the store.
1161,"00:55:29,880","00:55:32,314","Yeah, you mess with the cat,
you get the claws."
1162,"00:55:32,400","00:55:33,400",Bo came back!
1163,"00:55:33,480","00:55:34,680",Magic 8-Ball was right!
1164,"00:55:34,760","00:55:36,796","- Excuse me. Sorry.
- What are you doing here?"
1165,"00:55:36,880","00:55:38,836","I thought the store
had no return policy!"
1166,"00:55:39,000","00:55:40,115","Bo, help me out."
1167,"00:55:40,200","00:55:41,536",I need a battery.
1168,"00:55:41,560","00:55:44,279","We got to get
this wagon train a-movin'!"
1169,"00:55:44,480","00:55:45,856","- Agreed.
- Help, help, help."
1170,"00:55:45,880","00:55:46,880",Cheater.
1171,"00:55:47,040","00:55:48,155",Have you seen Duke?
1172,"00:55:48,360","00:55:49,634",He's in the back.
1173,"00:55:57,960","00:55:59,757","Look who jumped
40 school buses"
1174,"00:55:59,840","00:56:01,068",and landed back into my life.
1175,"00:56:01,240","00:56:03,356","- Hi, Duke!
- Who's the cowboy?"
1176,"00:56:03,440","00:56:05,237","Duke, meet Woody.
Woody, meet..."
1177,"00:56:05,320","00:56:08,437","Duke Caboom.
Canada's greatest stuntman."
1178,"00:56:08,520","00:56:10,112","Oh, yeah!"
1179,"00:56:11,280","00:56:12,395","- Yes!
- Huh?"
1180,"00:56:12,480","00:56:13,993",He's posing.
1181,"00:56:14,560","00:56:15,675",Duke?
1182,"00:56:15,840","00:56:17,831","- Duke, we need to...
- Hold on. One more."
1183,"00:56:18,000","00:56:20,150","Oh, yeah!
What brings you back, Peep?"
1184,"00:56:20,320","00:56:21,355",We need your help.
1185,"00:56:21,560","00:56:24,711","Gabby Gabby has his toy
and my sheep."
1186,"00:56:24,880","00:56:27,917","No. Billy, Goat, and Gruff?
Those are my girls."
1187,"00:56:28,600","00:56:30,113","What were you doing
getting tangled up"
1188,"00:56:30,240","00:56:31,593","with Gabby Gabby?
You know better."
1189,"00:56:31,760","00:56:34,069","Yeah, some toy thought
it would be a good idea..."
1190,"00:56:34,280","00:56:35,280",to wander into the aisle.
1191,"00:56:35,560","00:56:36,834",That doesn't make any sense.
1192,"00:56:37,000","00:56:38,194","It doesn't, does it?"
1193,"00:56:38,280","00:56:40,589","Everybody knows the best route
is behind the shelves."
1194,"00:56:40,760","00:56:42,990","That would have been
a better route, wouldn't it?"
1195,"00:56:43,160","00:56:44,991","Wow, this toy sounds like
a complete idiot."
1196,"00:56:45,080","00:56:46,672",He does!
1197,"00:56:46,760","00:56:48,557","Wait, are you that toy?"
1198,"00:56:49,120","00:56:50,473","So, here's the plan."
1199,"00:56:50,640","00:56:53,200","We need to jump over the aisle
to Gabby's cabinet."
1200,"00:56:53,360","00:56:56,079","- And you are the toy to do it.
- No."
1201,"00:56:56,160","00:56:57,309","- Duke.
- Nope."
1202,"00:56:57,400","00:56:58,799","- Duke? Duke?
- Nuh-uh. No way!"
1203,"00:56:58,880","00:57:00,279","- Duke. Duke!
- Pass. Negative."
1204,"00:57:00,440","00:57:01,475","- Duke.
- Rejected."
1205,"00:57:01,560","00:57:03,516","Oh, please, Mr. Caboom,
this is really important."
1206,"00:57:03,600","00:57:04,635",My kid...
1207,"00:57:04,800","00:57:05,800",You have a kid?
1208,"00:57:05,960","00:57:07,552",Uh...
1209,"00:57:07,640","00:57:10,029","Hey, Duke, show us some more
poses, what do you say?"
1210,"00:57:10,200","00:57:12,111","- I had a kid.
- Oh, no."
1211,"00:57:12,440","00:57:13,919",Rejean.
1212,"00:57:14,080","00:57:17,550","Rejean was so excited when
he got me after Christmas."
1213,"00:57:17,920","00:57:21,071","It was the happiest Boxing Day
of my life."
1214,"00:57:21,720","00:57:23,200","That's Duke Caboom,"
1215,"00:57:23,280","00:57:25,510","riding the amazing
Caboom stunt cycle!"
1216,"00:57:25,680","00:57:27,113",Caboom!
1217,"00:57:27,800","00:57:30,837","I was ready to finally
do what I was made to do."
1218,"00:57:31,000","00:57:32,433",Caboom!
1219,"00:57:32,600","00:57:34,431","But when Rejean realized
I couldn't jump"
1220,"00:57:34,520","00:57:36,112","as far as the toy
in the commercial..."
1221,"00:57:37,560","00:57:40,313","It's a commercial!
It's not real!"
1222,"00:57:40,480","00:57:41,913",Rejean threw me away!
1223,"00:57:42,080","00:57:43,195",It's not fair!
1224,"00:57:43,360","00:57:45,237","Why, Rejean? Why?"
1225,"00:57:46,920","00:57:50,071","Okay, okay.
Calm down, Duke."
1226,"00:57:50,240","00:57:51,798",That was a long time ago.
1227,"00:57:52,400","00:57:54,152","Right now,
we need the only toy"
1228,"00:57:54,280","00:57:56,669","who can crash us
onto Gabby's cabinet."
1229,"00:57:56,760","00:57:58,830",Crash?
1230,"00:57:58,920","00:58:00,956","Any Duke Caboom toy
can land..."
1231,"00:58:01,160","00:58:04,948","but you are the only one
that can crash the way you do."
1232,"00:58:05,120","00:58:06,439","- I am?
- Yes!"
1233,"00:58:06,720","00:58:09,029","Forget Rejean.
Forget your commercial."
1234,"00:58:09,200","00:58:11,395","Be the Duke
you are right now..."
1235,"00:58:11,560","00:58:14,597",the one who jumps and crashes!
1236,"00:58:17,160","00:58:21,676",Be who I am right now.
1237,"00:58:22,640","00:58:24,756","Who's the Canuck
with all the luck?"
1238,"00:58:25,600","00:58:26,600",Caboom?
1239,"00:58:26,760","00:58:28,557","Who's the greatest
of the Great White North?"
1240,"00:58:28,640","00:58:29,640",Caboom!
1241,"00:58:29,720","00:58:31,438","Who's the most spectacular
daredevil"
1242,"00:58:31,520","00:58:32,669",Canada has ever seen?
1243,"00:58:32,960","00:58:34,473",Duke Caboom!
1244,"00:58:34,840","00:58:35,909",Can you do the jump?
1245,"00:58:36,080","00:58:38,116","Yes, I Canada!"
1246,"00:58:40,120","00:58:41,838",Uh-huh.
1247,"00:58:41,920","00:58:43,911","- We've got our ride.
- Yes!"
1248,"00:58:44,320","00:58:45,833",Yee-haw!
1249,"00:58:46,520","00:58:47,589","Yo, Bo!"
1250,"00:58:47,680","00:58:49,591",Gigs! You made it!
1251,"00:58:49,960","00:58:51,029",Good work!
1252,"00:58:51,200","00:58:52,349",How'd you get it?
1253,"00:58:52,760","00:58:54,796",How do we get that key?
1254,"00:59:00,280","00:59:01,713","- It was hard.
- Very difficult."
1255,"00:59:01,880","00:59:03,313","- Barely made it out alive.
- Yeah."
1256,"00:59:03,480","00:59:04,549","So, you're welcome."
1257,"00:59:04,720","00:59:06,711",Okay. Let's do this.
1258,"00:59:07,560","00:59:09,471",Let me wrap that up for you.
1259,"00:59:09,640","00:59:12,074","Don't want anything to happen
to it on the way home."
1260,"00:59:12,240","00:59:14,435","Good. That sale buys us
some time."
1261,"00:59:15,560","00:59:16,709",Wait for it.
1262,"00:59:19,080","00:59:20,752","All right, let's go!"
1263,"01:00:02,440","01:00:04,510","So, how long were you in here?"
1264,"01:00:04,680","01:00:06,079","I don't know.
Couple years."
1265,"01:00:06,480","01:00:09,392","I didn't wanna sit on a shelf
waiting for my life to happen."
1266,"01:00:09,560","01:00:10,560","So, I left."
1267,"01:00:10,880","01:00:11,915",Wow.
1268,"01:00:12,080","01:00:14,310","You've handled this lost toy
life better than I could."
1269,"01:00:14,720","01:00:16,153","Aw, Sheriff."
1270,"01:00:16,520","01:00:18,192",You're selling yourself short.
1271,"01:00:20,160","01:00:22,435","I think you'd make
a great lost toy."
1272,"01:00:24,000","01:00:25,035",You really don't think
1273,"01:00:25,120","01:00:26,917","you'll ever be in a kid's room
again, huh?"
1274,"01:00:27,080","01:00:28,080",Nope.
1275,"01:00:28,240","01:00:29,776","And now with the carnival
traveling through,"
1276,"01:00:29,800","01:00:30,976","it's our chance
to hop a ride..."
1277,"01:00:31,000","01:00:32,991","- and leave town.
- You're leaving?"
1278,"01:00:33,160","01:00:34,160",Sure am.
1279,"01:00:34,320","01:00:36,560","You ever think about getting
out there, seeing the world?"
1280,"01:00:36,600","01:00:38,238",Without a kid?
1281,"01:00:38,360","01:00:41,238","No. You can't teach
this old toy new tricks."
1282,"01:00:41,320","01:00:43,311",You'd be surprised.
1283,"01:00:44,720","01:00:47,712","So, how'd you end up in
this store in the first place?"
1284,"01:00:47,880","01:00:50,189","Well, I saw your lamp
in the window..."
1285,"01:00:50,360","01:00:53,796","and I thought maybe
you were inside..."
1286,"01:00:54,000","01:00:55,956","and so I, uh..."
1287,"01:00:59,880","01:01:01,029",Wow.
1288,"01:01:02,040","01:01:03,268",Yeah.
1289,"01:01:04,720","01:01:05,720",Will you look at that?
1290,"01:01:07,000","01:01:09,992","This is the only part
of the store I ever liked."
1291,"01:01:17,920","01:01:20,912","That's gonna be quite a jump
for you and Duke."
1292,"01:01:22,400","01:01:23,435",For me?
1293,"01:01:28,120","01:01:29,416","Didn't I tell you?
You're going with him."
1294,"01:01:29,440","01:01:30,440",I am?
1295,"01:01:31,680","01:01:32,829",Let's caboom.
1296,"01:01:32,920","01:01:34,399","It'll be fine,
Duke's the best."
1297,"01:01:34,560","01:01:36,073","Yeah, at crashing."
1298,"01:01:40,240","01:01:41,389",And now!
1299,"01:01:43,720","01:01:44,755",Go!
1300,"01:01:44,840","01:01:45,840",Whoa!
1301,"01:01:53,360","01:01:55,237",Huh? Rejean.
1302,"01:01:55,440","01:01:57,954","It's a commercial.
It's not real!"
1303,"01:01:58,120","01:02:00,190","I can't do this!
I'm sorry, Rejean!"
1304,"01:02:00,560","01:02:01,993","No, no, no!"
1305,"01:02:10,880","01:02:12,677","What's new, pussycat?"
1306,"01:02:23,520","01:02:24,873","- Forky?
- Girls?"
1307,"01:02:25,040","01:02:26,720","Forky, where are you?"
1308,"01:02:26,880","01:02:28,472","You're never
gonna find me."
1309,"01:02:28,680","01:02:29,680",Forky?
1310,"01:02:30,760","01:02:32,910","Woody!
How'd you find me?"
1311,"01:02:33,080","01:02:34,877","- Bo, I found him!
- Hi."
1312,"01:02:35,040","01:02:37,634","Wait, it's an actual fork?"
1313,"01:02:38,080","01:02:39,308",Bo! Bo! Bo!
1314,"01:02:39,520","01:02:41,033","Buzz!
The dummies are gone!"
1315,"01:02:41,200","01:02:43,077","What?
Where'd they go?"
1316,"01:02:45,360","01:02:46,360","Okay, we can go now!"
1317,"01:02:46,440","01:02:48,760","- No. I need to find my girls.
- Hello, Woody."
1318,"01:02:48,920","01:02:49,920","Hi, Bo."
1319,"01:02:50,080","01:02:51,433","- Where are my sheep?
- Yeah!"
1320,"01:02:51,520","01:02:52,794",Look! Woody found me!
1321,"01:02:53,120","01:02:55,031","Take the bunny!
I'm too cute to die!"
1322,"01:02:57,360","01:02:58,839","Hi-ya!
- Oh, no, no!"
1323,"01:02:58,960","01:03:00,439",Woody!
1324,"01:03:00,600","01:03:03,353","- I just wanna talk.
- Yeah, with my voice box!"
1325,"01:03:04,720","01:03:05,789",Pull!
1326,"01:03:06,040","01:03:07,268",Whoa!
1327,"01:03:07,840","01:03:10,149",You're my favorite deputy.
1328,"01:03:11,480","01:03:13,471","Somebody's poisoned
the water hole."
1329,"01:03:13,600","01:03:15,136",I'd like to join your posse.
1330,"01:03:15,160","01:03:17,276",Reach for the sky!
1331,"01:03:28,840","01:03:30,193",Girls!
1332,"01:03:30,360","01:03:31,634",Drop it.
1333,"01:03:35,440","01:03:37,032","No! No!
Forky!"
1334,"01:03:37,200","01:03:38,269","- We've gotta go!
- Wait!"
1335,"01:03:39,240","01:03:40,593",Forky!
1336,"01:03:43,280","01:03:44,280",Woody!
1337,"01:03:57,720","01:03:58,835",Bonnie's backpack?
1338,"01:04:02,040","01:04:03,155",Ahh!
1339,"01:04:06,000","01:04:07,399",Giggle!
1340,"01:04:09,320","01:04:10,799",Don't let Woody leave!
1341,"01:04:13,720","01:04:14,720",Grab on!
1342,"01:04:19,400","01:04:20,879","Duke, get us out of here!"
1343,"01:04:21,080","01:04:22,080",Oui!
1344,"01:04:23,120","01:04:24,758","Here, kitty, kitty!"
1345,"01:04:24,960","01:04:26,598",Wait! We don't have Forky!
1346,"01:04:26,760","01:04:28,079",Woody!
1347,"01:04:32,000","01:04:33,035",Forky!
1348,"01:04:52,520","01:04:53,794",Is everyone okay?
1349,"01:04:57,320","01:04:59,470",Shh. It's okay.
1350,"01:04:59,680","01:05:01,193",Shh. It's okay.
1351,"01:05:01,760","01:05:03,637",Bunny? Bunny?
1352,"01:05:04,120","01:05:07,351","Bunny!
No, no, no, no."
1353,"01:05:07,520","01:05:10,080","No, no, no, no."
1354,"01:05:11,520","01:05:13,556","- Oh, Bunny!
- It's gonna be okay."
1355,"01:05:13,640","01:05:14,675",Forky's still in there.
1356,"01:05:14,760","01:05:16,376","If we hurry, we can get him
before they lock him up."
1357,"01:05:16,400","01:05:17,719","You want us
to go back in there?"
1358,"01:05:17,800","01:05:18,994",We barely got out alive.
1359,"01:05:19,160","01:05:20,388","Woody, it's better if we wait."
1360,"01:05:20,560","01:05:22,016","No, no, no. There's no time.
We can easily get back inside."
1361,"01:05:22,040","01:05:23,040",But I saw Bonnie's...
1362,"01:05:23,120","01:05:24,216","By my count, there were
only four dummies."
1363,"01:05:24,240","01:05:25,240",But the backpack...
1364,"01:05:25,320","01:05:26,456","We outnumber them.
So we have the advantage."
1365,"01:05:26,480","01:05:27,799","Woody, look at us!"
1366,"01:05:30,880","01:05:33,917","Nobody is with you.
It's over, okay?"
1367,"01:05:34,080","01:05:36,275","No. No, no, no. We are
wasting time. We can do this."
1368,"01:05:36,440","01:05:38,336","- Come on, Pull-string.
- It's not worth it."
1369,"01:05:38,360","01:05:39,395","Yeah, yes, listen to her!"
1370,"01:05:39,560","01:05:41,312","- Nobody wants this!
- I do!"
1371,"01:05:41,400","01:05:42,515","- Why?
- Because!"
1372,"01:05:42,680","01:05:44,432","- Why?
- Just because!"
1373,"01:05:44,520","01:05:45,520",Why?
1374,"01:05:45,600","01:05:46,960","Because it's all
I have left to do!"
1375,"01:05:49,680","01:05:51,398",I don't have anything else.
1376,"01:05:52,880","01:05:54,438","So, the rest of us
don't count?"
1377,"01:05:55,600","01:05:57,477",That's not what I meant.
1378,"01:05:57,680","01:05:59,033",Bonnie needs Forky.
1379,"01:05:59,200","01:06:01,634",No. You need Bonnie!
1380,"01:06:01,800","01:06:03,028","Open your eyes, Woody."
1381,"01:06:03,120","01:06:05,031","There's plenty of kids
out there."
1382,"01:06:05,200","01:06:09,239","It can't be just about the one
you're still clinging to."
1383,"01:06:09,440","01:06:11,237",It's called loyalty.
1384,"01:06:11,440","01:06:13,271","Something a lost toy
wouldn't understand."
1385,"01:06:21,280","01:06:23,316",I'm not the one who's lost.
1386,"01:06:24,880","01:06:26,074",Let's get out of here.
1387,"01:06:26,240","01:06:28,708","We've got a carnival
that leaves in the morning."
1388,"01:06:28,920","01:06:30,194",Come on.
1389,"01:06:30,400","01:06:31,628",Mmm-hmm.
1390,"01:06:31,720","01:06:32,994",We'll find our own kid.
1391,"01:06:33,160","01:06:34,513",You're crazy.
1392,"01:06:37,200","01:06:38,235",Bo!
1393,"01:06:38,560","01:06:41,677","Bye, Woody.
Good luck with Bonnie."
1394,"01:06:47,520","01:06:50,830","Woody, you did all you could."
1395,"01:06:51,000","01:06:52,672",Time to go home.
1396,"01:06:52,840","01:06:53,909",No.
1397,"01:06:54,000","01:06:55,000",Woody.
1398,"01:06:55,080","01:06:56,479","I don't leave toys behind,
Buzz."
1399,"01:06:56,560","01:06:57,936","Yeah, but, Woody,
you're actually leaving..."
1400,"01:06:57,960","01:06:59,791",Not now. Not ever.
1401,"01:07:01,600","01:07:03,431",And he left me behind.
1402,"01:07:04,400","01:07:06,038","What now, inner voice?"
1403,"01:07:06,200","01:07:08,080","Mission
accomplished. Return to base."
1404,"01:07:08,120","01:07:10,315","Go back to the RV?
What about Woody?"
1405,"01:07:10,480","01:07:12,198","We're going home,
space ranger."
1406,"01:07:12,360","01:07:13,554","Fall back, this planet..."
1407,"01:07:13,720","01:07:14,789",Retreat! There's too...
1408,"01:07:14,880","01:07:16,791","Go! Time to fly! Exit the...
Back... Run..."
1409,"01:07:16,960","01:07:18,598","Get out!
Returning to Star Command."
1410,"01:07:18,800","01:07:21,030",Okay. Okay.
1411,"01:07:22,680","01:07:24,477","Thanks a lot, inner voice."
1412,"01:07:25,720","01:07:29,190","Harmony, honey, help Grandma
close up for the night."
1413,"01:07:29,360","01:07:32,113","Okay. Then can we
go to the carnival?"
1414,"01:07:32,280","01:07:33,280",Sure.
1415,"01:07:38,320","01:07:40,038","- Ahhh!
- Hello, Woody."
1416,"01:07:41,640","01:07:42,755",I knew you'd be back.
1417,"01:07:44,200","01:07:45,474",You don't know me.
1418,"01:07:45,760","01:07:47,193",But I do.
1419,"01:07:47,760","01:07:50,752","You were left in the closet,
feeling useless..."
1420,"01:07:51,400","01:07:53,391","wondering if you'll
ever get played with."
1421,"01:07:53,560","01:07:55,357",I'm not leaving without Forky.
1422,"01:07:55,560","01:07:57,551","Can we agree
on just one thing?"
1423,"01:07:58,320","01:07:59,469",What?
1424,"01:07:59,560","01:08:01,278",That being there for a child
1425,"01:08:01,360","01:08:04,670","is the most noble thing
a toy can do."
1426,"01:08:06,120","01:08:07,235",Okay.
1427,"01:08:09,600","01:08:13,115","I was defective
right out of the box."
1428,"01:08:13,280","01:08:16,078","I can only imagine what it
must have been like for you."
1429,"01:08:17,760","01:08:20,672","All that time you spent
with Andy..."
1430,"01:08:21,200","01:08:24,636","riding a bike with him
for the first time..."
1431,"01:08:25,400","01:08:28,472","comforting him
when he skinned his knee..."
1432,"01:08:28,920","01:08:30,876",proudly watching him grow up.
1433,"01:08:32,320","01:08:35,278","And then you got
a second chance with Bonnie..."
1434,"01:08:35,440","01:08:38,159","giving her comfort
when she's scared at school..."
1435,"01:08:38,320","01:08:40,914","helping her
when she needs it most."
1436,"01:08:42,000","01:08:45,629","You've been there through
all their ups and downs."
1437,"01:08:47,600","01:08:49,079",Please.
1438,"01:08:49,240","01:08:50,434",Be honest with me.
1439,"01:08:52,520","01:08:55,114","Was it as wonderful
as it sounds?"
1440,"01:08:59,080","01:09:00,433",It was.
1441,"01:09:03,920","01:09:07,993","All I want is a chance
for just one of those moments."
1442,"01:09:10,520","01:09:14,229","I'd give anything to be loved
the way you have."
1443,"01:09:20,280","01:09:21,679",Just leave me Forky.
1444,"01:09:23,400","01:09:25,072",Bonnie needs him.
1445,"01:09:26,720","01:09:28,312",Of course.
1446,"01:09:39,520","01:09:42,193",The flat tire is fixed!
1447,"01:09:42,400","01:09:44,231","Come on, Woody, hurry up."
1448,"01:09:44,400","01:09:46,675",Where is he?
1449,"01:09:46,760","01:09:48,512","- Buzz!
- Buzz!"
1450,"01:09:48,680","01:09:50,136","- Where's Woody?
- And Forky?"
1451,"01:09:50,160","01:09:51,229",We have a situation.
1452,"01:09:51,400","01:09:53,136","They need to be extracted
from the antique store."
1453,"01:09:53,160","01:09:54,520",How do we do that?
1454,"01:09:54,560","01:09:56,296","Okay, let's
make sure we have everything."
1455,"01:09:56,320","01:09:57,992",Finally.
1456,"01:09:58,160","01:09:59,513","It's okay.
Any minute now..."
1457,"01:09:59,680","01:10:02,035","Bonnie will notice
her backpack is missing."
1458,"01:10:02,200","01:10:04,136","She'll realize she left it
at the antique store..."
1459,"01:10:04,160","01:10:05,479",and we'll head back in there.
1460,"01:10:05,920","01:10:07,656","Okay.
Looks like we have everything."
1461,"01:10:07,680","01:10:09,079","- You good, Bonnie?
- Yup."
1462,"01:10:09,160","01:10:10,736",Great. Let's get out of here.
1463,"01:10:11,880","01:10:13,711","Okay, genius,
what do we do now?"
1464,"01:10:13,800","01:10:14,800",Hmm.
1465,"01:10:14,880","01:10:15,936",Scanning perimeter.
1466,"01:10:15,960","01:10:16,960",Laser at full power!
1467,"01:10:17,040","01:10:19,156","- Buzz, what are you doing?
- I'm thinking."
1468,"01:10:19,240","01:10:21,016","Honey, will you
please shut that toy off?"
1469,"01:10:21,040","01:10:22,040","Yeah, I got it."
1470,"01:10:22,120","01:10:24,031","Attack!
Meteor shower! Look out!"
1471,"01:10:25,400","01:10:26,936","It's a secret mission in
uncharted space! Let's go!"
1472,"01:10:26,960","01:10:29,235",Buzz Lightyear to the rescue!
1473,"01:10:29,400","01:10:30,576","Bonnie,
how do you turn this off?"
1474,"01:10:30,600","01:10:31,720",Full speed ahead!
1475,"01:10:31,760","01:10:33,576","- Open the pod bay doors!
- I don't know."
1476,"01:10:33,600","01:10:35,158","It's just you and me now,
cadet."
1477,"01:10:35,240","01:10:36,576","A distress signal is coming
from that rocket."
1478,"01:10:36,600","01:10:38,216",Just toss it in the drawer.
1479,"01:10:38,240","01:10:41,277",To infinity and beyond!
1480,"01:10:41,360","01:10:43,720","Uh-oh. Uh, your backpack's in
the antique store! Let's go!"
1481,"01:10:44,000","01:10:45,115","Oh, no, my backpack!"
1482,"01:10:46,160","01:10:48,390","I left my backpack
in the antique store!"
1483,"01:10:48,480","01:10:49,833",You did?
1484,"01:10:50,000","01:10:52,912","All right,
let's swing by and get it."
1485,"01:10:57,920","01:11:00,798","Ugh! I can't believe
the nerve of that cowboy."
1486,"01:11:00,880","01:11:02,199","I mean,
who does he think he is?"
1487,"01:11:02,280","01:11:03,599",Exactly!
1488,"01:11:03,680","01:11:05,352",He was way out of line.
1489,"01:11:05,520","01:11:07,200","You did the right thing
leaving him behind."
1490,"01:11:08,640","01:11:10,073","- Hey, Lamb Chops?
- Hmm."
1491,"01:11:10,200","01:11:11,872","- Coast is clear.
- Oh."
1492,"01:11:17,360","01:11:18,360",Head to the middle.
1493,"01:11:18,520","01:11:19,953","When the carnival
leaves tomorrow,"
1494,"01:11:20,040","01:11:21,268",we'll hide right there.
1495,"01:11:23,400","01:11:24,594","- Uh, no way!
- Stuff that."
1496,"01:11:24,680","01:11:25,680",Awesome.
1497,"01:11:25,880","01:11:27,074","Stick with me.
You'll be fine."
1498,"01:11:27,240","01:11:28,296","- Ready?
- No!"
1499,"01:11:28,320","01:11:29,320","And another thing,"
1500,"01:11:29,400","01:11:30,976","- Woody asked you for help.
- On your mark..."
1501,"01:11:31,000","01:11:32,096",And he treats you like that?
1502,"01:11:32,120","01:11:34,236","- ...get set...
- He only cares about himself."
1503,"01:11:34,320","01:11:35,320",No!
1504,"01:11:35,400","01:11:36,656",You're wrong.
1505,"01:11:36,680","01:11:38,440","Woody's always trying to
do right by his kid."
1506,"01:11:38,560","01:11:40,232",By putting everyone in danger.
1507,"01:11:40,320","01:11:42,754","Ugh. That kind of crazy
loyalty just..."
1508,"01:11:42,920","01:11:44,148",You gotta love him for it.
1509,"01:11:44,360","01:11:46,136","Whoa, say what now?"
1510,"01:11:46,160","01:11:47,639","Hey, hey, hey, Bo!
What's the plan?"
1511,"01:11:47,720","01:11:48,914",Fill me in here.
1512,"01:11:54,960","01:11:56,336",Get in! We're going back.
1513,"01:11:56,360","01:11:57,360",We just got here.
1514,"01:11:57,520","01:11:59,272","You heard Bo!
We're going back!"
1515,"01:11:59,440","01:12:01,510",Move your plush! Let's ride!
1516,"01:12:08,400","01:12:09,992",You're my favorite...
1517,"01:12:23,720","01:12:24,914",Yay!
1518,"01:12:26,440","01:12:28,078",You are my best friend.
1519,"01:12:28,160","01:12:29,593",Let's play all day!
1520,"01:12:29,680","01:12:31,318","Oh, Benson!
Did you hear that?"
1521,"01:12:31,480","01:12:32,708",Isn't that lovely?
1522,"01:12:32,880","01:12:33,949",Time for tea.
1523,"01:12:34,160","01:12:35,832","Oh, thank you, Woody.
Thank you!"
1524,"01:12:36,280","01:12:37,599",All my dreams
1525,"01:12:37,680","01:12:38,880","are coming true
because of you."
1526,"01:12:38,920","01:12:40,035",Thank you! Thank you!
1527,"01:12:40,120","01:12:41,120","Uh, you're welcome."
1528,"01:12:42,280","01:12:44,316","It's time, Benson."
1529,"01:12:45,120","01:12:47,588","Goodbye, Forky.
I'm going to miss our talks."
1530,"01:12:47,800","01:12:50,155","Me, too.
Good luck, Gabby."
1531,"01:12:50,320","01:12:52,117","Thank you, my little utensil."
1532,"01:12:53,520","01:12:56,239","Bye, Gabby!
Goodbye, Benson!"
1533,"01:12:57,240","01:12:59,310",He is terrifying.
1534,"01:13:00,640","01:13:01,959","- Hello.
- Hi."
1535,"01:13:02,040","01:13:03,189",Bonnie?
1536,"01:13:03,280","01:13:04,536",Can I help you with anything?
1537,"01:13:04,560","01:13:05,816","Yeah. We called
about the backpack."
1538,"01:13:05,840","01:13:07,637","Oh, yes.
I couldn't find it."
1539,"01:13:08,120","01:13:09,496",Feel free to look around.
1540,"01:13:09,520","01:13:11,750",Quick! Before she finds it!
1541,"01:13:14,320","01:13:16,311",Look! There's Harmony.
1542,"01:13:19,320","01:13:21,072",You make me so happy!
1543,"01:13:21,160","01:13:22,275",Let's be best friends.
1544,"01:13:23,240","01:13:24,639","Oh, this is it!"
1545,"01:13:25,000","01:13:26,558","We're going home, Forky!"
1546,"01:13:27,280","01:13:28,280",Huh?
1547,"01:13:29,320","01:13:31,197",Forky! Oh!
1548,"01:13:32,120","01:13:34,429","No, no, no. Woody, look!
It's really happening!"
1549,"01:13:40,840","01:13:43,274","I'm Gabby Gabby,
and I love you."
1550,"01:13:45,000","01:13:46,672",I'm gonna cry.
1551,"01:13:50,920","01:13:52,114","Oh, what have you got there?"
1552,"01:13:52,320","01:13:53,992",I found this old doll.
1553,"01:13:54,920","01:13:57,150","You can take it home
if you want."
1554,"01:13:58,920","01:13:59,989",Nah.
1555,"01:14:07,800","01:14:10,189","What happened? Gabby was
supposed to be her toy."
1556,"01:14:10,360","01:14:12,056",There's my backpack!
1557,"01:14:12,080","01:14:13,149","Mom, it's over here."
1558,"01:14:18,360","01:14:19,509",Forky!
1559,"01:14:19,720","01:14:21,119","Mom, I found him!"
1560,"01:14:21,200","01:14:22,713","Oh, there he is!"
1561,"01:14:23,200","01:14:24,679","Now, please leave him
in there,"
1562,"01:14:24,760","01:14:25,920",so he doesn't get lost again.
1563,"01:14:33,440","01:14:34,634",But what about Gabby?
1564,"01:14:36,360","01:14:37,918","Forky, listen to me
very carefully."
1565,"01:14:38,080","01:14:39,718",This is important.
1566,"01:14:39,880","01:14:41,836","Tell Buzz to get the RV
to the merry-go-round."
1567,"01:14:42,000","01:14:43,035",You understand?
1568,"01:14:43,200","01:14:45,236","Absolutely.
What is a merry-go-round?"
1569,"01:14:45,320","01:14:47,959","The spinny ride
with lights and horses."
1570,"01:14:48,120","01:14:49,400","- Oh. You mean a carousel.
- Yes!"
1571,"01:14:50,160","01:14:51,718","Carousel. Yes!
Meet me at the carousel."
1572,"01:14:51,840","01:14:52,840",Got it.
1573,"01:15:06,240","01:15:08,629","Gabby! Hey, Gabby!"
1574,"01:15:09,320","01:15:11,595","You can have
your voice box back."
1575,"01:15:13,400","01:15:15,118",I don't need it anymore.
1576,"01:15:15,320","01:15:16,355","Oh, yes, you do."
1577,"01:15:16,680","01:15:18,272","Harmony wasn't
your only chance, Gabby,"
1578,"01:15:18,360","01:15:19,560",but we have to hurry. Come on.
1579,"01:15:19,640","01:15:22,871",No. Harmony was my chance.
1580,"01:15:23,760","01:15:25,910",My time's over.
1581,"01:15:26,040","01:15:27,996","Now, please go away."
1582,"01:15:39,840","01:15:41,193",You hear that?
1583,"01:15:47,800","01:15:49,677",A friend once told me...
1584,"01:15:49,840","01:15:52,229","""There are plenty of kids
out there."""
1585,"01:15:53,440","01:15:55,908","And one of them
is named Bonnie."
1586,"01:15:57,760","01:16:00,194","She's waiting for you,
right now."
1587,"01:16:01,600","01:16:03,431",She just doesn't know it yet.
1588,"01:16:05,960","01:16:08,315",What if you're wrong?
1589,"01:16:10,240","01:16:12,096","Well, if you sit on a shelf
the rest of your life..."
1590,"01:16:12,120","01:16:14,076","you'll never find out,
will you?"
1591,"01:16:17,800","01:16:19,028",He's right.
1592,"01:16:19,920","01:16:21,751",I learned that from the best.
1593,"01:16:26,000","01:16:28,150","Come on, Gabby."
1594,"01:16:28,320","01:16:29,958",Let's get you to Bonnie.
1595,"01:16:36,720","01:16:37,720",The carousel?
1596,"01:16:37,800","01:16:40,394","Yeah, it's the spinny ride
with lights and horses."
1597,"01:16:40,560","01:16:42,198",Woody said to meet him there.
1598,"01:16:42,360","01:16:44,191","- You gotta be kidding!
- How do we do that?"
1599,"01:16:44,280","01:16:45,474","Oh! We could, uh..."
1600,"01:16:45,560","01:16:46,834","We are not
sending Dad to jail."
1601,"01:16:47,000","01:16:48,069",You're no fun.
1602,"01:16:48,240","01:16:50,800",Left turn in 0.5 miles.
1603,"01:16:51,000","01:16:53,594",Wait a second. I have an idea.
1604,"01:17:04,920","01:17:05,920",Skunk!
1605,"01:17:06,000","01:17:07,000",Skunk!
1606,"01:17:17,840","01:17:19,956","Too many people.
Gonna need an alternate route."
1607,"01:17:20,120","01:17:22,111","Will we make it
to the carousel in time?"
1608,"01:17:26,080","01:17:28,196","Yes, we Canada!"
1609,"01:17:28,360","01:17:29,509",What? What is it?
1610,"01:17:35,800","01:17:38,997","Recalculating.
Take a right."
1611,"01:17:39,080","01:17:40,229",What? A right?
1612,"01:17:40,400","01:17:42,118",Right turn ahead.
1613,"01:17:42,200","01:17:44,096","Huh. Does
the GPS sound funny to you?"
1614,"01:17:44,120","01:17:45,800","Honey, it's fine. Just drive."
1615,"01:17:45,840","01:17:47,640","Hmm,
I thought it sounded funny."
1616,"01:17:50,720","01:17:51,720",Another right!
1617,"01:17:51,880","01:17:53,916","- Right.
- Take another right."
1618,"01:17:54,000","01:17:55,513","- Huh?
- Another right? Really?"
1619,"01:17:55,680","01:17:56,715","- Turn right!
- Now!"
1620,"01:17:56,800","01:17:58,153",Turn right!
1621,"01:18:00,160","01:18:02,096","- We're headin' back.
- There's the carousel!"
1622,"01:18:02,120","01:18:04,588","Do you think
Woody will get there in time?"
1623,"01:18:05,000","01:18:07,514","Nope. Forget it. Never.
No. No way. Declined."
1624,"01:18:07,680","01:18:09,560","- No dice. Rejected.
- Duke, Duke, you got this."
1625,"01:18:09,720","01:18:11,392","This is the fastest way
to the carousel."
1626,"01:18:11,560","01:18:12,675",You made the last jump.
1627,"01:18:12,840","01:18:14,831","Yeah, but that was 4 feet.
This is 40!"
1628,"01:18:15,040","01:18:18,271","Exactly! Duke Caboom
would never repeat a stunt."
1629,"01:18:18,440","01:18:20,237","- No. He'd never do that.
- No, no, no."
1630,"01:18:20,400","01:18:22,356","He's the toy
that went on to crash"
1631,"01:18:22,440","01:18:25,432",40 feet into that target!
1632,"01:18:25,600","01:18:27,556","Yeah, he is."
1633,"01:18:27,760","01:18:29,239",I'm Duke Caboom!
1634,"01:18:29,400","01:18:31,118","Oh, man. I can do this!"
1635,"01:18:31,280","01:18:32,474","Yes, you Canada!"
1636,"01:18:32,680","01:18:33,896","I can do it
with my eyes closed."
1637,"01:18:33,920","01:18:34,920","Yes, you... What?"
1638,"01:18:35,000","01:18:36,840","- Three, two, one. Go!
- What? No, wait!"
1639,"01:18:42,600","01:18:44,272","- What is he doing?
- Oh, no."
1640,"01:18:55,040","01:18:57,235","This is for you, Rejean."
1641,"01:19:02,760","01:19:04,034",Caboom.
1642,"01:19:07,280","01:19:08,280",Yes!
1643,"01:19:08,360","01:19:09,760",He did it!
1644,"01:19:09,920","01:19:10,920","All right, our turn!"
1645,"01:19:11,080","01:19:12,991","You heard the sheriff.
Let's go."
1646,"01:19:19,120","01:19:20,120",Yee-haw!
1647,"01:19:22,880","01:19:24,233",Another right!
1648,"01:19:24,440","01:19:26,032","Another right?
That's the wrong way."
1649,"01:19:26,200","01:19:28,077","- Are you sure?
- Stupid rental."
1650,"01:19:28,280","01:19:29,760","- I'm turning us around.
- No!"
1651,"01:19:29,800","01:19:31,256","- Huh?
- Recalculating."
1652,"01:19:31,280","01:19:32,349",Turn right.
1653,"01:19:32,520","01:19:34,829","- Must be broken.
- No! No!"
1654,"01:19:39,240","01:19:40,360",What is happening?
1655,"01:19:40,440","01:19:41,616","Honey, what are you doing?
Slow down!"
1656,"01:19:41,640","01:19:42,640",I can't! I can't!
1657,"01:19:43,280","01:19:45,480","- Press the brake. Press it!
- I'm trying."
1658,"01:19:51,920","01:19:53,319","Got a visual
on the RV,"
1659,"01:19:53,400","01:19:55,436",heading southbound.
1660,"01:20:00,800","01:20:01,800",Gabby?
1661,"01:20:04,360","01:20:05,360",Gabby?
1662,"01:20:09,320","01:20:10,719",I think she's lost.
1663,"01:20:26,280","01:20:27,633",Are you sure?
1664,"01:20:38,760","01:20:40,079",Change of plans.
1665,"01:20:45,400","01:20:46,958",Pull over.
1666,"01:20:47,520","01:20:49,476",I can't! This is a rental!
1667,"01:20:49,640","01:20:50,993",I don't know what's happening!
1668,"01:21:01,520","01:21:03,033",I'm so nervous.
1669,"01:21:03,640","01:21:05,676","- What if she doesn't like me?
- Gabby."
1670,"01:21:05,760","01:21:06,936",I don't know if I can do this.
1671,"01:21:06,960","01:21:09,428","Gabby,
it's just like you said."
1672,"01:21:10,040","01:21:12,952","This is the most noble thing
a toy can do."
1673,"01:21:18,120","01:21:19,120",Okay.
1674,"01:21:19,200","01:21:21,998","Just edge yourself
a bit into the light."
1675,"01:21:24,960","01:21:26,473",Not too far.
1676,"01:21:27,000","01:21:28,194",That's it.
1677,"01:21:29,520","01:21:30,748",Perfect.
1678,"01:21:32,120","01:21:33,997","- Winner, winner...
- Chicken dinner."
1679,"01:21:56,440","01:21:58,351","Are you lost, too?"
1680,"01:22:02,120","01:22:04,475","I'm Gabby Gabby.
Will you be my friend?"
1681,"01:22:05,960","01:22:07,552",I'll help you.
1682,"01:22:14,520","01:22:18,035","Excuse me, can you...
Can you help us?"
1683,"01:22:18,240","01:22:19,593","Oh, honey, what's wrong?"
1684,"01:22:19,760","01:22:21,478",I can't find my mom and dad.
1685,"01:22:21,640","01:22:23,358","It's okay.
I'll help you find them."
1686,"01:22:23,520","01:22:24,669",I'm sure they're not far.
1687,"01:22:25,160","01:22:26,216",She was right next to us.
1688,"01:22:26,240","01:22:27,673",She was right here!
1689,"01:22:27,760","01:22:29,336","And I looked
away for one second."
1690,"01:22:29,360","01:22:30,588",Mommy!
1691,"01:22:38,680","01:22:39,908",I couldn't find you...
1692,"01:22:40,080","01:22:41,274",and then I found this doll.
1693,"01:22:41,440","01:22:42,440",You did?
1694,"01:22:42,640","01:22:43,914",Her name is Gabby Gabby.
1695,"01:22:56,320","01:22:58,788",Whoa. We actually did that.
1696,"01:22:59,160","01:23:01,515","Oh, yeah. Yes!"
1697,"01:23:01,680","01:23:03,398",That was amazing.
1698,"01:23:03,560","01:23:05,437","We make a great team, guys."
1699,"01:23:07,240","01:23:09,834",Pull over now!
1700,"01:23:11,600","01:23:13,238",Almost there.
1701,"01:23:14,640","01:23:16,198","- Stop!
- Stop!"
1702,"01:23:21,160","01:23:22,593",Are we home?
1703,"01:23:23,040","01:23:24,439",Huh?
1704,"01:23:26,280","01:23:28,748","Sir, will you please
step out of the vehicle?"
1705,"01:23:28,920","01:23:31,434",Dad's totally going to jail.
1706,"01:23:37,720","01:23:39,392","Everyone, topside.
Let's move."
1707,"01:23:39,560","01:23:42,154","Forky, I've got a very
important job for you."
1708,"01:23:42,480","01:23:43,959",For me?
1709,"01:23:44,400","01:23:46,231",Have a good night.
1710,"01:23:47,560","01:23:49,676",What the...?
1711,"01:23:50,800","01:23:52,756",You've gotta be kidding me.

1768,"01:32:23,520","01:32:24,616","How was ""Present and Explain""?"
1769,"01:32:24,640","01:32:26,296","Uh, you mean ""Show and Tell""
there, big guy."
1770,"01:32:26,320","01:32:27,594",You see any kids eat paste?
1771,"01:32:27,680","01:32:28,680","Guys, listen!"
1772,"01:32:28,760","01:32:31,228","Bonnie had a great day
in first grade."

a new friend in class."
1774,"01:32:33,720","01:32:35,950","Oh, she's already
making friends."
1775,"01:32:36,120","01:32:38,759","No, no, she made a new friend."
1776,"01:32:39,120","01:32:41,634","Come on out, it's okay."
1777,"01:33:00,040","01:33:03,396","Hi. I'm, uh... I'm Forky."
1778,"01:33:03,720","01:33:05,551",Trash?
1779,"01:33:05,760","01:33:08,718","No, no. Toy.
I am a..."
1780,"01:33:09,160","01:33:10,912",We are all toys.
1781,"01:33:11,400","01:33:14,870","Unique, beautiful toys."
1782,"01:33:15,560","01:33:18,836",I will explain everything.
1783,"01:33:19,640","01:33:23,679",How am I alive?
1784,"01:33:26,000","01:33:28,230",I don't know.
1785,"01:33:43,520","01:33:47,798",I was a lonesome cowboy
1786,"01:33:49,080","01:33:52,197",Lonesome as I could be
1787,"01:33:53,080","01:33:57,039","You came along
and changed my life"
1788,"01:33:57,600","01:34:00,672","And fixed
what was broken in me"
1789,"01:34:02,120","01:34:06,955",I was a lonesome cowboy
1790,"01:34:08,400","01:34:10,436",I didn't have a friend
1791,"01:34:11,640","01:34:15,679","Now I got friends
coming out of my ears"
1792,"01:34:15,840","01:34:19,515",I'll never be lonesome again
1793,"01:34:20,720","01:34:24,952","You can't be happy
when you're all by yourself"
1794,"01:34:25,120","01:34:27,350","Go on, tell me I'm wrong"
1795,"01:34:27,520","01:34:28,919",You're wrong
1796,"01:34:29,480","01:34:33,234","When someone takes you
down from the shelf"
1797,"01:34:33,400","01:34:36,710","And plays with you some
It's wonderful"
1798,"01:34:36,880","01:34:38,108",Wonderful
1799,"01:34:38,280","01:34:42,751",I was a lonesome cowboy
1800,"01:34:44,360","01:34:46,669",But not anymore
1801,"01:34:47,840","01:34:51,833","I just found out
What love is about"
1802,"01:34:52,000","01:34:55,276","I've never
felt this way before"
1803,"01:34:56,840","01:34:59,991",I was a lonesome cowboy
1804,"01:35:02,080","01:35:06,710",But not anymore
1805,"01:39:55,680","01:39:56,829",Caboom!
1806,"01:39:58,320","01:39:59,320",Yes!
