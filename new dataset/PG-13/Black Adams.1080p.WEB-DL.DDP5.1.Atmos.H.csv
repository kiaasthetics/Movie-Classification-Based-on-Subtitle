2,"00:00:42,417","00:00:45,170","before the pyramids,
there was kahndaq."
3,"00:00:52,594","00:00:54,805","The first self-governing people
on earth,"
4,"00:00:54,888","00:00:57,766","kahndaq was a center of power
and enlightenment."
5,"00:00:57,849","00:00:59,518","For centuries, they thrived."
6,"00:01:05,440","00:01:07,776",But then...
7,"00:01:11,363","00:01:12,447",Came king ahk-ton.
8,"00:01:14,241","00:01:17,953","Using the army to seize power,
ahk-ton became a tyrant."
9,"00:01:18,036","00:01:19,621","But he had
even darker ambitions."
10,"00:01:28,130","00:01:29,881","Obsessed with dark magic,"
11,"00:01:29,965","00:01:33,218","ahk-ton's real goal was
to forge the crown of sabbac."
12,"00:01:38,015","00:01:39,933","If infused with the powers
of the six demons"
13,"00:01:40,017","00:01:42,227",of the ancient world...
14,"00:01:42,311","00:01:45,188","It would make ahk-ton
invincible."
15,"00:01:45,272","00:01:47,190","To make the crown,
he needed eternium."
16,"00:01:47,274","00:01:48,942","A rare mineral
of magic properties,"
17,"00:01:49,026","00:01:51,403",found only in kahndaq.
18,"00:01:51,486","00:01:53,071",So he enslaved his own people
19,"00:01:55,032","00:01:56,783",and forced them to dig.
20,"00:02:09,713","00:02:11,173",Eternium.
21,"00:02:14,926","00:02:18,347",Eternium.
22,"00:02:27,898","00:02:29,649","Kahndaq was teetering
on the brink."
23,"00:02:31,318","00:02:32,944",What they needed...
24,"00:02:33,028","00:02:34,946",Get off him! Get off him!
25,"00:02:35,030","00:02:37,199",Get off him! Get off him!
26,"00:02:38,867","00:02:40,243",Was a hero.
27,"00:02:40,327","00:02:43,288",Why are we fighting each other?
28,"00:02:43,372","00:02:46,416","Remember who our real enemy is!
Come with me."
29,"00:02:48,668","00:02:50,170",Look! Eternium.
30,"00:02:52,130","00:02:53,130",Let me see that.
31,"00:02:58,303","00:03:01,181",The king thanks you.
32,"00:03:01,264","00:03:02,384",He's supposed to reward him.
33,"00:03:02,432","00:03:04,142",Is that right?
34,"00:03:04,226","00:03:05,477",I want what I'm owed.
35,"00:03:06,395","00:03:07,562",Hmm.
36,"00:03:11,024","00:03:12,567",You want a reward?
37,"00:03:16,196","00:03:17,823","The king thanks you
for your service."
38,"00:03:26,498","00:03:28,458","You want the king's reward, too?"
39,"00:03:30,168","00:03:33,046","No, but my son accepts
the king's mercy."
40,"00:03:39,136","00:03:42,389","I won't always be here
to protect you."
41,"00:03:42,472","00:03:45,183","I don't need protection.
I want to be free."
42,"00:03:45,267","00:03:48,103","If we fight together,
we could overthrow the king."
43,"00:03:48,186","00:03:49,563",Let someone else be the hero...
44,"00:03:49,646","00:03:51,815",The graveyards are full of them.
45,"00:03:51,898","00:03:54,526","Stop dreaming
and go back to work."
46,"00:03:59,614","00:04:01,741","Someone to hold
the hopes of the people."
47,"00:04:04,619","00:04:06,955",Even when all hope seems lost.
48,"00:04:08,290","00:04:11,376",If we had more heroes...
49,"00:04:11,460","00:04:14,129","Then maybe our freedom
wouldn't be a dream!"
50,"00:04:17,424","00:04:19,259",Freedom!
51,"00:04:41,948","00:04:43,700","King ahk-ton knew
that this spark"
52,"00:04:43,783","00:04:45,410",could quickly ignite a fire.
53,"00:04:45,494","00:04:48,121","And so, he ordered
that it be snuffed out."
54,"00:04:52,000","00:04:53,960","They thought they were
getting a martyr."
55,"00:04:55,795","00:04:57,297",Instead...
56,"00:04:57,380","00:04:59,180",They got a miracle.
57,"00:05:09,184","00:05:10,602","The council of wizards,"
58,"00:05:10,685","00:05:12,395","the magical guardians
of the earth..."
59,"00:05:12,479","00:05:14,648",You have been chosen.
60,"00:05:14,731","00:05:16,011",Sought to restore the balance.
61,"00:05:16,066","00:05:17,651",The stamina of shu!
62,"00:05:17,734","00:05:19,712","They empowered him with
the gifts of the ancient gods."
63,"00:05:19,736","00:05:20,612","- The swiftness of heru!
- The strength of amon!"
64,"00:05:20,695","00:05:21,988",And turned a boy...
65,"00:05:22,072","00:05:23,490",The wisdom of zehuti!
66,"00:05:23,573","00:05:24,449","- The power of aten!
- The courage of mehen!"
67,"00:05:24,533","00:05:25,200",Into a champion.
68,"00:05:25,283","00:05:26,283",Shazam!
69,"00:05:28,411","00:05:30,205","Hurry.
Give it to me!"
70,"00:05:30,288","00:05:31,933","But the crown had
already been completed."
71,"00:05:31,957","00:05:33,077",Give it to me!
72,"00:05:35,752","00:05:37,104","And when the champion
arrived at the palace"
73,"00:05:37,128","00:05:39,130",to challenge him...
74,"00:05:39,214","00:05:41,341","King ahk-ton summoned
its demonic power."
75,"00:05:46,137","00:05:49,766","In the ensuing battle,
the palace was destroyed,"
76,"00:05:49,849","00:05:52,602",but the champion was victorious.
77,"00:05:52,686","00:05:54,563","The wizards hid
the crown of sabbac"
78,"00:05:54,646","00:05:57,566","so that it would never again
fall into the hands of man."
79,"00:05:57,649","00:06:00,527","And the champion
was never heard from again."
80,"00:06:05,448","00:06:08,785","Today, kahndaq is occupied
by international mercenaries,"
81,"00:06:08,868","00:06:11,997","the intergang, the latest in
a series of foreign invaders."
82,"00:06:14,583","00:06:17,586","But legend says, whenever
kahndaq needs him most,"
83,"00:06:17,669","00:06:21,590","the champion will return to
restore freedom to the people."
84,"00:06:21,673","00:06:23,925","It has been a long, long wait."
85,"00:06:37,731","00:06:38,773",Show me your papers.
86,"00:06:43,194","00:06:44,779",Move it along!
87,"00:06:44,863","00:06:46,340",Have your documentation ready.
88,"00:06:48,908","00:06:50,744","It's all our
three documents, yeah?"
89,"00:06:50,827","00:06:52,078","Don't judge the picture,"
90,"00:06:52,162","00:06:53,802","it's after my girlfriend
broke up with me."
91,"00:06:58,668","00:07:02,130","Open the back.
Need a look inside."
92,"00:07:05,133","00:07:06,551","Yeah, it's unlocked, man."
93,"00:07:08,428","00:07:11,222","It's just a bunch of old tvs.
I'm an electrician."
94,"00:07:18,146","00:07:20,398",Hey!
95,"00:07:20,482","00:07:21,733",Watch where you're going.
96,"00:07:21,816","00:07:23,526","You know the drill,
back of the line."
97,"00:07:23,610","00:07:25,403","Come on, man,
you see me every day."
98,"00:07:25,487","00:07:27,131","And every day I tell ya,"
99,"00:07:27,155","00:07:28,948","if it's got wheels,
it's a vehicle."
100,"00:07:29,032","00:07:30,450","Back of the line, mate."
101,"00:07:30,533","00:07:31,618",You're not my mate.
102,"00:07:32,994","00:07:35,747","I'm heartbroken.
Now, go on, piss off."
103,"00:07:35,830","00:07:39,250","No, what you are
is a Neo-imperialist enforcer,"

109,"00:07:51,763","00:07:55,016","Hey, boss man. Can I go?"
110,"00:07:55,809","00:07:56,809",Hey!
111,"00:08:01,439","00:08:02,565","Go on, get out of here."
112,"00:08:02,649","00:08:04,109","Yeah, yeah."
113,"00:08:13,076","00:08:14,494","Adrianna, we're clear."
114,"00:08:22,043","00:08:24,379","Kahndaq isn't safe
for us anymore."
115,"00:08:24,462","00:08:25,690","Let's just move the crown first,"
116,"00:08:25,714","00:08:26,994","and then we can
worry about safe."
117,"00:08:27,048","00:08:28,758","I got intergang
watching my house."
118,"00:08:28,842","00:08:31,636","I gave up my job at the
university and moved four times."
119,"00:08:31,720","00:08:33,513","It doesn't mean I'm gonna
abandon my country."
120,"00:08:33,596","00:08:36,266","I'm just saying, no one stays
a step ahead of them forever."
121,"00:08:36,349","00:08:38,435","We can't wait for things
to cool down this time."
122,"00:08:38,518","00:08:41,521","If I'm right, they're days
away from finding it."
123,"00:08:46,443","00:08:48,737","- What are you doing?
- I want to come with you."
124,"00:08:48,820","00:08:50,155",You know it's too dangerous.
125,"00:08:50,238","00:08:51,781","You shouldn't have
gotten involved."
126,"00:08:51,865","00:08:54,451","Come on, I want to help you
beat those bastards."
127,"00:08:54,534","00:08:56,369","Adrianna,
keep your head down, please."
128,"00:08:56,453","00:08:58,288","- You want to be a hero, huh?
- I do, yeah."
129,"00:08:58,371","00:09:00,248","Go home, do your homework."
130,"00:09:00,331","00:09:04,377","Your time will come one day,
but not today, son."
131,"00:09:04,461","00:09:05,462",Go!
132,"00:09:05,545","00:09:07,338","Go, little man. You did good."
133,"00:09:37,660","00:09:39,829","That would get you a fortune
on the black market."
134,"00:09:40,914","00:09:42,457",Is that real eternium?
135,"00:09:44,042","00:09:45,460",Show us a little magic.
136,"00:09:45,543","00:09:47,670","It doesn't work like that,
it's unrefined."
137,"00:09:47,754","00:09:49,255",You guys should get some rest.
138,"00:09:49,339","00:09:51,424","I thought intergang
seized all the old relics."
139,"00:09:51,508","00:09:52,634","Hey, come on. Stop it."
140,"00:09:52,717","00:09:53,986",I'm just curious how she got it.
141,"00:09:54,010","00:09:55,804",My grandmother gave it to me.
142,"00:09:55,887","00:09:59,390","- How did she get it?
- It's not a museum piece."
143,"00:09:59,474","00:10:01,392","It's a family heirloom,
going all the way back"
144,"00:10:01,476","00:10:03,269","to the days
when kahndaq was free."
145,"00:10:04,270","00:10:05,772",You happy now?
146,"00:10:05,855","00:10:07,023",Cool story.
147,"00:10:11,027","00:10:12,862","And all I inherited
was a sweater."
148,"00:10:12,946","00:10:15,573","That's not true. Baba left you
his Van and his bald spot."
149,"00:10:15,657","00:10:17,367","You know, some women
like a bald spot."
150,"00:10:17,450","00:10:19,911","Curly on the outside,
smooth on the inside. You know?"
151,"00:10:45,019","00:10:46,604",Are you sure about this?
152,"00:10:46,688","00:10:48,528","The inscriptions
we found are clear."
153,"00:10:48,606","00:10:51,317","And I'm positive
about that translation."
154,"00:10:51,401","00:10:53,319","There is something
inside that mountain."
155,"00:10:56,406","00:10:59,284","What if it really
is the crown? Then what?"
156,"00:10:59,367","00:11:01,327","It's a source of great power.
Who gets to keep it?"
157,"00:11:01,411","00:11:04,330","No one. We hide it again
someplace else."
158,"00:11:04,414","00:11:06,291","Get it out of the country
if we have to."
159,"00:11:06,374","00:11:08,710","It is too dangerous

a lot more than that."

340,"00:27:49,084","00:27:50,127","Of course, sir."
341,"00:28:06,018","00:28:07,811",So what's the op?

if you need me."
350,"00:28:36,089","00:28:37,716","It's pretty cool.
You got any snacks?"
351,"00:28:40,552","00:28:42,471","It takes a lot of energy
to smash atoms."
352,"00:28:55,984","00:28:56,985",Here.
353,"00:28:58,111","00:28:59,237",Oh! Thanks.

359,"00:29:14,962","00:29:15,962",Cool.
360,"00:29:44,282","00:29:45,659",Whoa!
361,"00:30:01,049","00:30:02,849","Don't worry about that.
I can get another one."
362,"00:30:06,722","00:30:08,265","Uh, my mom's
not much of a doctor,"
363,"00:30:08,348","00:30:09,975","but you should probably
leave the..."
364,"00:30:12,019","00:30:13,562",Or do that.
365,"00:30:17,566","00:30:19,234","I know you have a lot
to catch up on."
366,"00:30:19,317","00:30:21,278","But I was thinking
we could help each other."
367,"00:30:21,361","00:30:23,530","- Move.
- I'm amon, by the way."
368,"00:30:23,613","00:30:25,198",I didn't ask for your name.
369,"00:30:25,282","00:30:26,575","You're teth Adam, right?"
370,"00:30:26,658","00:30:28,201","Everyone in kahndaq
knows your story."
371,"00:30:28,285","00:30:29,995","- I said move.
- My mom said you took out"
372,"00:30:30,078","00:30:31,830","a bunch of intergang soldiers
in the desert."
373,"00:30:31,913","00:30:33,433","Because they wouldn't move
out of my way."
374,"00:30:33,457","00:30:35,083","So you can really fly
and stop bullets,"
375,"00:30:35,167","00:30:36,960","'cause that's really crucial
to my plan."
376,"00:30:37,044","00:30:38,521","And is it really you stopping
the bullets or is it the suit?"
377,"00:30:38,545","00:30:40,172","Wait, what's your top speed?"
378,"00:30:40,255","00:30:42,295","I'm sure you're fast,
but how fast? Like flash fast?"
379,"00:30:48,847","00:30:50,807","Wait, did you really
not have mirrors back then?"
380,"00:30:52,684","00:30:54,811","Wow, I guess a lot does change
in 5,000 years."
381,"00:30:57,689","00:30:59,274",Five thousand years?
382,"00:30:59,357","00:31:00,793","Yeah, that's how long
you were in the tomb."
383,"00:31:00,817","00:31:02,694",Until my mom woke you up.
384,"00:31:02,778","00:31:05,322","So you've got stopping bullets,
check, flying, check"
385,"00:31:05,405","00:31:07,074","and lightning thing,
that's a big check."
386,"00:31:12,954","00:31:14,372",I don't know this place.
387,"00:31:14,456","00:31:16,041",This is your home.
388,"00:31:19,795","00:31:20,921",Then my home is gone.
389,"00:31:37,187","00:31:38,313",What happened to the crown?
390,"00:31:39,356","00:31:40,982",Too much?
391,"00:31:44,820","00:31:46,863","You know it's cursed
with demons, right?"
392,"00:31:56,957","00:32:01,086","""Life is the...
Only path to death."""
393,"00:32:02,671","00:32:03,964",No shit.

kahndaqi Demi-god."
395,"00:32:11,012","00:32:15,058","He defeated king ahk-ton
in approximately 2,600 bc."""
396,"00:32:15,142","00:32:16,726",There. That's you. See?
397,"00:32:16,810","00:32:18,079","That's the statue
they built of you."
398,"00:32:18,103","00:32:19,813",And now you're back.
399,"00:32:19,896","00:32:21,332","Our country's been oppressed
by one invader after another"
400,"00:32:21,356","00:32:23,567",ever since you left.
401,"00:32:23,650","00:32:26,319","My point is,
kahndaq still isn't free."
402,"00:32:26,403","00:32:28,822","We could really use a superhero
right about now."
403,"00:32:29,614","00:32:31,449",I'm no hero.
404,"00:32:31,533","00:32:33,827","What?
Superman, Batman, aquaman..."
405,"00:32:33,910","00:32:35,829","You're way more stacked
than any of them."
406,"00:32:35,912","00:32:38,206","And they're not coming
to kahndaq to save us."
407,"00:32:38,290","00:32:40,500","But you could stop intergang
all by yourself,"
408,"00:32:40,584","00:32:41,824",just like you did king ahk-ton.

413,"00:33:17,078","00:33:20,040","Hey, mom.
He's awake."
414,"00:33:20,123","00:33:21,499","I told you
not to go in your room."
415,"00:33:22,751","00:33:23,877",It was you who spoke.
416,"00:33:26,296","00:33:28,173",You woke me.
417,"00:33:28,256","00:33:30,425","I didn't have a choice. I'd
be dead if it hadn't worked."
418,"00:33:30,508","00:33:32,260","The men in my tomb,
they were your enemies?"
419,"00:33:32,344","00:33:34,596","- Yes.
- Then your enemies are vanquished,"
420,"00:33:34,679","00:33:36,598","condemned to the eternal sleep
of the damned."
421,"00:33:36,681","00:33:39,121","Actually, we still have a lot of
enemies that need vanquishing."
422,"00:33:39,184","00:33:40,936",Then destroy them.
423,"00:33:41,019","00:33:43,146","Intergang have guns and
flybikes and eternium rockets."
424,"00:33:43,230","00:33:44,230",We have my mom.
425,"00:33:45,899","00:33:47,317",Prove your strength.
426,"00:33:47,400","00:33:49,040","Destroy your enemy
and all he cares about."
427,"00:33:49,069","00:33:50,362","Make him beg for mercy,"
428,"00:33:50,445","00:33:52,364","but deny it
until his final breath."
429,"00:33:52,447","00:33:54,199","Interesting, okay?"
430,"00:33:54,282","00:33:55,867","I appreciate
what you did for me,"
431,"00:33:55,951","00:33:59,120","but I do not want you
teaching my son violence."
432,"00:34:00,413","00:34:02,123",I understand.
433,"00:34:02,207","00:34:04,227","You want his father
to teach him violence."
434,"00:34:04,251","00:34:06,091","- Gross, that's my brother.
- That's my sister."
435,"00:34:06,169","00:34:08,255","- His father's dead.
- I'm sorry."
436,"00:34:09,839","00:34:11,442","Who do you want
to teach him violence then?"
437,"00:34:11,466","00:34:14,094","Yeah, mom. Who do you want
to teach me violence?"
438,"00:34:14,177","00:34:15,762",No one.
439,"00:34:15,845","00:34:19,724","I want a champion to help
free kahndaq from intergang."
440,"00:34:20,934","00:34:22,602","Please, help us."
441,"00:34:40,912","00:34:41,913",Wait! Wait.
442,"00:34:43,540","00:34:46,376","- Where are you going?
- I shouldn't be here."
443,"00:34:46,459","00:34:48,628","You don't feel any loyalty
to us at all?"
444,"00:34:48,712","00:34:50,130","Not really, no."
445,"00:34:50,213","00:34:51,732","You're not seeing
the full possibilities here."
446,"00:34:51,756","00:34:53,675","I don't know what it was like
in ancient times,"
447,"00:34:53,758","00:34:55,820","but having superpowers is
kind of a big deal in our world."
448,"00:34:55,844","00:34:57,404","Maybe clean up your outfit
a little bit,"
449,"00:34:57,429","00:34:58,638","get a cape, change your name."
450,"00:34:58,722","00:35:00,515",Teth Adam is a very strong name.
451,"00:35:00,598","00:35:01,933",It's a little outdated.
452,"00:35:02,017","00:35:03,411","And you definitely need
a catchphrase."
453,"00:35:03,435","00:35:04,978","Something blackout bad-ass
to say"
454,"00:35:05,061","00:35:07,230","right before you absolutely
cook some dude."
455,"00:35:07,314","00:35:08,773",I don't waste words on the dead.
456,"00:35:08,857","00:35:10,543","Well, yeah, kind of like that,
but more catchy."
457,"00:35:10,567","00:35:12,152","I was thinking, like,"
458,"00:35:12,235","00:35:14,155","""tell them the man in black
sent you."""
459,"00:35:14,237","00:35:15,739","- Them?
- You know, gods, demons..."
460,"00:35:15,822","00:35:17,866","Whoever's waiting for us
in the afterlife."
461,"00:35:17,949","00:35:19,802","And you wear a lot of black, so
we should really lean into that."
462,"00:35:19,826","00:35:22,370","My point is,
you could be famous."
463,"00:35:22,454","00:35:24,497","Magazines, lunch boxes,
video games."
464,"00:35:24,581","00:35:27,500","And the superhero industrial
complex is worth a lot of money."
465,"00:35:27,584","00:35:29,294",I don't need a box for my lunch.
466,"00:35:29,377","00:35:31,296","Anyone you've ever known
is dead."
467,"00:35:34,507","00:35:36,092",What else are you gonna do?
468,"00:35:40,722","00:35:42,557",Wait! Where are you going?
469,"00:35:58,365","00:36:01,076","Waller's file needs a bit
to be desired."
470,"00:36:01,159","00:36:02,827","Most of this was
considered a myth"
471,"00:36:02,911","00:36:04,704",until yesterday afternoon.
472,"00:36:04,788","00:36:07,582","He's a bad man, Kent.
What else do you need to know?"
473,"00:36:07,665","00:36:10,210","When you've seen as many
different futures as I have,"
474,"00:36:10,293","00:36:12,170","you cease to believe
in absolutes."
475,"00:36:14,422","00:36:16,299",What are you laughing at?
476,"00:36:16,383","00:36:18,760","I'm not laughing.
That was a smirk."
477,"00:36:18,843","00:36:21,471",I know. That's how you laugh.
478,"00:36:21,554","00:36:22,806",I've missed having you around
479,"00:36:22,889","00:36:25,850","to spout old cryptic shit
like that."
480,"00:36:25,934","00:36:27,977","Almost as much as I've missed
having you around"
481,"00:36:28,061","00:36:30,563","to ignore all my advice.
Carter..."
482,"00:36:32,107","00:36:33,858",This is not a very good plan.
483,"00:36:37,904","00:36:39,906","Yeah, well..."
484,"00:36:39,989","00:36:42,158","A bad plan is better
than no plan at all."
485,"00:36:44,369","00:36:45,995","If only there were
a third option."
486,"00:36:49,874","00:36:51,594","I wouldn't touch that
if I was you."
487,"00:36:52,669","00:36:54,087",Why not?
488,"00:36:54,170","00:36:55,689","'Cause that helmet
is from another planet."
489,"00:36:55,713","00:36:57,006",It's millions of years old.
490,"00:36:57,090","00:36:58,716",It chooses who it lets touch it.
491,"00:37:00,301","00:37:01,970","- Like Kent?
- Yeah."
492,"00:37:02,053","00:37:05,432","Like, Kent is literally
possessed when he puts it on."
493,"00:37:05,515","00:37:06,850","What happens
if I touch it anyway?"
494,"00:37:06,933","00:37:10,186","Soul crushing terror?
Or... something."
495,"00:37:10,270","00:37:12,981","So we should probably
put a towel on it, right?"
496,"00:37:13,064","00:37:14,357",Coming up on it.
497,"00:37:14,441","00:37:16,776",Ready stations in five.
498,"00:37:16,860","00:37:19,237","Hey, why is this Adam dude
so pissed off?"
499,"00:37:19,320","00:37:20,572",He's not some dude.
500,"00:37:20,655","00:37:23,783","He's a weapon
of mass destruction."
501,"00:37:23,867","00:37:25,869","You don't have to
raise your hand."
502,"00:37:25,952","00:37:28,392","Question, if he's so powerful,
how are we supposed to stop him?"
503,"00:37:28,455","00:37:31,374","If we can get him
to say the word, ""shazam,"""
504,"00:37:31,458","00:37:33,543",teth Adam will lose his power.
505,"00:37:33,626","00:37:34,961",And we're hoping since he's had
506,"00:37:35,044","00:37:37,422","a few thousand years
to sleep it off,"
507,"00:37:37,505","00:37:40,842","we can peacefully negotiate
the terms of his existence."
508,"00:37:40,925","00:37:43,028","From the footage you showed us,
he doesn't really seem like"
509,"00:37:43,052","00:37:44,929","a ""peacefully negotiate""
kind of guy."
510,"00:37:45,013","00:37:46,264",Correct.
511,"00:37:46,347","00:37:47,347",Look alive.
512,"00:37:50,185","00:37:51,185",We're here.
513,"00:38:33,019","00:38:34,187",Forgive me.
514,"00:38:48,076","00:38:49,452",This is a message
515,"00:38:49,536","00:38:51,055","- for all intergang soldiers.
- Hey! Stop!"
516,"00:38:51,079","00:38:53,331","Kahndaq has its own
official superhero now."
517,"00:39:17,355","00:39:18,565",Teth Adam!
518,"00:39:20,692","00:39:22,694",Please.
519,"00:39:22,777","00:39:25,780",There he is! Move!
520,"00:39:25,863","00:39:27,532","- Teth Adam!
- Move!"
521,"00:39:28,533","00:39:29,659",Teth Adam...
522,"00:39:31,202","00:39:33,663","Get up! Who's gonna
save you now, mate?"
523,"00:39:36,583","00:39:37,667",The statue?
524,"00:39:39,919","00:39:41,462",That's my son.
525,"00:39:41,546","00:39:43,673","He's just a boy. He doesn't
know what he's doing."
526,"00:39:44,799","00:39:45,799",What are you doing?
527,"00:39:46,759","00:39:49,387",Hang on. I recognize you.
528,"00:39:49,470","00:39:51,097",Where is the crown?
529,"00:39:52,181","00:39:53,975",Let's go!
530,"00:40:08,656","00:40:09,842","You could've showed up
a bit sooner."
531,"00:40:09,866","00:40:10,866",But that was dope.
532,"00:40:16,664","00:40:17,664",We need backup down here.
533,"00:40:58,748","00:41:00,541","Tell them
the man in black sent you."
534,"00:41:00,625","00:41:03,503","Well, yes, but not to me.
Say it to the bad guys."
535,"00:41:04,462","00:41:05,672",But before you zap them.
536,"00:41:05,755","00:41:07,507","- Catchphrase, then kill.
- Yes."
537,"00:41:30,279","00:41:31,155",He's here.
538,"00:41:31,239","00:41:32,532",You sense his presence?
539,"00:41:32,615","00:41:34,867",No.
540,"00:41:34,951","00:41:38,162","I assume he's the only person
in kahndaq that can do that."
541,"00:41:48,923","00:41:51,467","Fate and I'll take
the lead. Listen..."
542,"00:41:51,551","00:41:53,886","Now, you two hang back
till we call you."
543,"00:41:53,970","00:41:55,596","We're the anvil,
you're the hammer."
544,"00:41:55,680","00:41:57,348",You're ready.
545,"00:41:57,432","00:41:59,076","Uh, he just dropped the, um..."
546,"00:41:59,100","00:42:00,893",Shit!
547,"00:42:06,899","00:42:07,984",Be prepared.
548,"00:42:15,616","00:42:16,616",Um...
549,"00:42:28,880","00:42:30,131",Behind you!
550,"00:42:43,853","00:42:45,021",Let us be!
551,"00:42:46,647","00:42:48,900","I don't know their crimes,
but whatever they are,"
552,"00:42:48,983","00:42:50,860","these men should face
due process."
553,"00:42:55,198","00:42:56,866","Then let the gods
make their judgment."
554,"00:42:56,949","00:42:58,284","- Yeah!
- Yeah!"
555,"00:42:58,367","00:43:00,578","You don't look like
an intergang."
556,"00:43:00,661","00:43:03,122",We're the justice society.
557,"00:43:03,206","00:43:06,417","Our mission is to protect
global stability."
558,"00:43:06,501","00:43:09,921","We're here to restore peace
to kahndaq."
559,"00:43:10,004","00:43:13,049","And we will use force
if necessary."
560,"00:43:15,176","00:43:17,011",Force is always necessary.
561,"00:43:17,094","00:43:18,638",Teth Adam.
562,"00:43:18,721","00:43:22,225","We know who you are
and what you are capable of."
563,"00:43:22,308","00:43:24,769","There's no place for you
in the world of man."
564,"00:43:26,145","00:43:27,355",You have two choices.
565,"00:43:28,105","00:43:29,816",Kneel or die.
566,"00:43:31,275","00:43:32,985",I was a slave until I died.
567,"00:43:34,821","00:43:36,197",Then I was reborn a god.
568,"00:43:38,491","00:43:40,159",I kneel before no one.
569,"00:43:47,625","00:43:49,293","Fate, give me a distraction."
570,"00:44:42,346","00:44:45,391","Just say, ""shazam.""
We all go home."
571,"00:44:47,643","00:44:49,020",I don't have a home.
572,"00:45:21,886","00:45:22,887",Whoo!
573,"00:45:22,970","00:45:24,388",Look at that suit. It's cool.
574,"00:45:24,472","00:45:26,265","- Thanks. You, too.
- Thank you."
575,"00:45:26,349","00:45:28,267","It was a hand-me-down.
It was from my uncle."
576,"00:45:34,774","00:45:36,494","Hawkman just
does not give up, does he?"
577,"00:45:36,525","00:45:37,525",Nope.
578,"00:45:50,581","00:45:52,917","Amon, where are you going?
Wait!"
579,"00:45:53,000","00:45:54,168",To help him!
580,"00:46:15,064","00:46:17,608","Cyclone, smasher,
now is your time."
581,"00:46:17,692","00:46:19,402",Let's roll!
582,"00:46:19,485","00:46:21,005","What are you doing?
Hey! Hey, hey, hey!"
583,"00:47:02,695","00:47:03,988",No!
584,"00:47:09,618","00:47:10,618",I'll be right there!
585,"00:47:20,296","00:47:22,048",You have the crown of sabbac.
586,"00:48:05,424","00:48:06,984",I can't hold him much longer.
587,"00:48:12,598","00:48:13,599",Move!
588,"00:48:34,870","00:48:37,057","I'm coming!
I'm zeroing in on your location!"
589,"00:49:09,113","00:49:12,408","I got him! Guys, I got him."
590,"00:49:12,491","00:49:15,661","It's, uh... it's me, al. In case
you didn't recognize me."
591,"00:49:15,744","00:49:17,224","There's something different
about you."
592,"00:49:17,288","00:49:18,956",Can't quite put my finger on it.
593,"00:49:19,039","00:49:20,809","You know, it's probably because
I'm six stories tall now."
594,"00:49:20,833","00:49:22,293","But you, you're like a tornado."
595,"00:49:22,376","00:49:24,920","I thought the two of you
did great work."
596,"00:49:25,004","00:49:26,922","- First time out...
- Bravo."
597,"00:49:27,006","00:49:29,341","Thanks. I mean, I got a little
turned around back there,"
598,"00:49:29,425","00:49:30,801","but, uh,
it all worked out, right?"
599,"00:49:30,885","00:49:32,511",You're damn right it did.
600,"00:49:32,595","00:49:34,395","Let's hope waller has
that cell ready for him."
601,"00:49:40,186","00:49:42,730","You want me
to keep my hand here, right?"
602,"00:49:42,813","00:49:44,398",You'd better not let him up.
603,"00:49:45,900","00:49:48,694","Uh... what do I... what do I do?
Guys?"
604,"00:49:52,823","00:49:53,823",Woo-hoo!
605,"00:50:05,669","00:50:08,005",Long live the champion!
606,"00:50:08,088","00:50:10,341",Long live the champion!
607,"00:50:10,424","00:50:12,468",Long live the champion!
608,"00:50:12,551","00:50:14,762",Long live the champion!
609,"00:50:22,603","00:50:25,648","Yeah, he's definitely
still breathing."
610,"00:50:25,731","00:50:29,985","Long live the champion!
Long live the champion!"
611,"00:50:48,587","00:50:50,464","Where are you going?
We need to go after him."
612,"00:50:50,547","00:50:52,716",We're not strong enough.
613,"00:50:52,800","00:50:55,487","Oh, well, maybe next time use your
powers of prediction to figure that out"
614,"00:50:55,511","00:50:57,096",before we get our asses kicked.
615,"00:50:57,179","00:50:58,764",I'm working on it.
616,"00:50:58,847","00:51:00,266",Miss?
617,"00:51:00,349","00:51:01,989","Excuse me, you mind
if I look in your bag?"
618,"00:51:02,017","00:51:03,269","Yes, I do mind."
619,"00:51:03,352","00:51:04,770","Where are you going
with this, Kent?"
620,"00:51:04,853","00:51:06,272",She's got the crown of sabbac.
621,"00:51:06,355","00:51:08,023",One catastrophe at a time.
622,"00:51:08,107","00:51:09,542","We can't give him
a chance to regroup."
623,"00:51:09,566","00:51:11,360","He's been spotted
entering the palace."
624,"00:51:11,443","00:51:13,487","It's safe to say he's not
going there to surrender."
625,"00:51:13,570","00:51:15,281","Why do you want
teth Adam to surrender?"
626,"00:51:15,364","00:51:17,491","He's the champion of kahndaq.
Who are you?"
627,"00:51:17,574","00:51:19,493",The justice society?
628,"00:51:19,576","00:51:21,829","We have been living
under military occupation"
629,"00:51:21,912","00:51:24,498","for 27 years,
and never seen you before."
630,"00:51:24,581","00:51:27,209","You didn't come when
intergang invaded our country,"
631,"00:51:27,293","00:51:29,878","when they stole our resources
and killed my husband."
632,"00:51:29,962","00:51:32,464","But now, we finally
have our own hero"
633,"00:51:32,548","00:51:35,801","and you decide to fly
down here and save us?"
634,"00:51:35,884","00:51:38,178","Thank you, but...
We're covered."
635,"00:51:38,262","00:51:41,849","Go and protect international
stability someplace else."
636,"00:51:41,932","00:51:44,601","Oh, and second,
I don't have the crown."
637,"00:51:44,685","00:51:46,603",Let me spell it out for you.
638,"00:51:46,687","00:51:48,647","Teth Adam can't be
kahndaq's champion"
639,"00:51:48,731","00:51:50,190",because he is not a hero.
640,"00:51:50,274","00:51:52,401",Tell that...
641,"00:51:52,484","00:51:56,405","To all the people
he just liberated."
642,"00:51:56,488","00:51:58,824","I know what this looks like.
I... I do."
643,"00:51:58,907","00:52:00,200",But I can assure you that my...
644,"00:52:03,746","00:52:06,248","I am so sorry.
Was that expensive?"
645,"00:52:07,916","00:52:10,210","Me and you.
When we get back to the ship..."
646,"00:52:10,294","00:52:12,212","- Yes, sir.
- Me and you."
647,"00:52:12,296","00:52:13,296",I...
648,"00:52:14,673","00:52:16,216","Can we please
just see the crown?"
649,"00:52:17,051","00:52:18,093",I don't have it.
650,"00:52:36,737","00:52:38,197",We don't have time for this.
651,"00:52:38,280","00:52:40,282","Teth Adam first, then the crown."
652,"00:52:40,366","00:52:42,785","You don't have
any authority here."
653,"00:52:42,868","00:52:44,078",Teth Adam has done nothing...
654,"00:52:44,161","00:52:46,830","Teth Adam is not
who you think he is."
655,"00:52:46,914","00:52:48,332",And how would you know?
656,"00:52:48,415","00:52:50,000",We have access to ancient texts
657,"00:52:50,084","00:52:51,960","that have been kept secret
for centuries."
658,"00:52:52,044","00:52:54,630","And what exactly do these
supposed ancient texts say?"
659,"00:52:54,713","00:52:58,967","They say that his rage
nearly destroyed kahndaq."
660,"00:52:59,051","00:53:00,386","And we flew
all the way over here"
661,"00:53:00,469","00:53:02,763",to stop it from happening again.
662,"00:53:05,849","00:53:07,369",You want to go in there alone?
663,"00:53:07,393","00:53:09,186",Are you sure?
664,"00:53:09,269","00:53:11,855","You want to go in and fight
teth Adam again, be my guest."
665,"00:53:11,939","00:53:14,274","But if you actually want
to resolve things peacefully,"
666,"00:53:14,358","00:53:16,318","without destroying
the rest of my city,"
667,"00:53:16,402","00:53:17,402",I'm your only shot.
668,"00:53:40,676","00:53:42,511","You brought
the invaders with you."
669,"00:53:42,594","00:53:44,721",They only want to talk.
670,"00:53:44,805","00:53:48,100",They can talk. I won't listen.
671,"00:53:50,060","00:53:52,396","When I was a little girl, my
grandmother told me the story"
672,"00:53:52,479","00:53:55,441","of how the champion came
to this exact spot"
673,"00:53:55,524","00:53:57,276","to free the enslaved people
of kahndaq"
674,"00:53:57,359","00:53:59,486","by defeating king ahk-ton
in battle."
675,"00:53:59,570","00:54:01,572","But according
to the justice society,"
676,"00:54:01,655","00:54:03,449",that's not really what happened.
677,"00:54:03,532","00:54:06,118","They say that you didn't
come here to seek justice."
678,"00:54:08,787","00:54:10,707",Hurry. Give it to me!
679,"00:54:15,169","00:54:17,379",That you came to exact revenge.
680,"00:54:33,228","00:54:34,605",And in your anger...
681,"00:54:36,690","00:54:42,154","Don't kill me.
I can give you anything you want."
682,"00:54:42,237","00:54:44,031",This is what I want.
683,"00:54:44,114","00:54:46,825","Your power grew
until it became uncontrollable."
684,"00:54:54,041","00:54:57,127","And the council of wizards
was forced to deem you unworthy"
685,"00:54:57,211","00:54:59,379","of the gifts that
you were granted."
686,"00:54:59,463","00:55:01,465",We have chosen recklessly...
687,"00:55:01,548","00:55:03,842",And humanity has paid the price.
688,"00:55:03,926","00:55:07,137","And now, teth Adam...
You must pay."
689,"00:55:27,032","00:55:29,368","It wasn't your tomb
that I opened, was it?"
690,"00:55:32,454","00:55:33,914",It was your prison.
691,"00:55:35,499","00:55:38,335","And, now, there's
a statue of you."
692,"00:55:38,418","00:55:42,089","Out of the hope that someday
kahndaq's champion would return."
693,"00:55:42,172","00:55:43,799","But it's built on a lie,
isn't it?"
694,"00:55:43,882","00:55:45,884",I never said I was a hero.
695,"00:55:45,968","00:55:48,178",I never claimed to be anything.
696,"00:55:48,262","00:55:50,722",You may not have been a hero.
697,"00:55:50,806","00:55:53,308","But that doesn't mean
that you can't be one now."
698,"00:56:00,816","00:56:02,359",I will hear them out.
699,"00:56:02,442","00:56:04,570","But if they choose to fight,
they choose to die."
700,"00:56:10,576","00:56:12,327",Uncle karim!
701,"00:56:12,411","00:56:13,680","I can't believe you're
sitting around watching TV"
702,"00:56:13,704","00:56:15,024",when the most epic day ever is...
703,"00:56:15,080","00:56:17,332","In here, little man."
704,"00:56:19,293","00:56:21,545","Ishmael! My mom said
you got buried in the tomb."
705,"00:56:21,628","00:56:22,879","Funny story, he didn't."
706,"00:56:22,963","00:56:25,132",Where's Adrianna?
707,"00:56:25,215","00:56:26,425",She's back at the square...
708,"00:56:26,508","00:56:27,652","We should go bail her out
right now."
709,"00:56:27,676","00:56:28,778","But she's the one
who sent me home"
710,"00:56:28,802","00:56:30,002",to make sure the crown's safe.
711,"00:56:30,053","00:56:31,638","It is safe, okay?
Somewhere else."
712,"00:56:31,722","00:56:34,224",Definitely not here. Let...
713,"00:56:34,308","00:56:35,743","- Put the bag down.
- What are you doing?"
714,"00:56:35,767","00:56:38,353","Back away.
Put the bag down, now."
715,"00:56:41,898","00:56:43,275","Give him the bag.
Give him the bag."
716,"00:56:45,152","00:56:46,152",Very good. Back away.
717,"00:56:47,613","00:56:49,239","- Back away.
- Okay, I'm..."
718,"00:56:59,207","00:57:01,376","It's all going
to be okay, little man."
719,"00:57:01,460","00:57:03,580","Let me teach you some
history that you've never learned"
720,"00:57:03,629","00:57:05,088",in one of your mother's classes.
721,"00:57:05,172","00:57:06,840","When we had a powerful king,"
722,"00:57:06,923","00:57:10,260","kahndaq used to be something
much better than free."
723,"00:57:10,344","00:57:11,803",It used to be great.
724,"00:57:11,887","00:57:13,430","Run, amon, run!"
725,"00:57:32,240","00:57:33,408",Crash the building.
726,"00:57:33,492","00:57:35,160","I lost the kid.
He has the crown."
727,"00:57:51,259","00:57:53,136","We're here
to negotiate the terms"
728,"00:57:53,220","00:57:55,681",of your peaceful surrender.
729,"00:57:55,764","00:57:59,017","I'm not peaceful.
Nor do I surrender."
730,"00:57:59,101","00:58:01,311","What have
your powers ever given to you?"
731,"00:58:01,395","00:58:03,480",Nothing but heartache.
732,"00:58:03,563","00:58:05,023",You have no idea.
733,"00:58:05,107","00:58:06,733","Then why are you
making this hard on us?"
734,"00:58:06,817","00:58:08,860","We both know you're not
supposed to be here."
735,"00:58:08,944","00:58:11,571","It is you who is not supposed
to be here."
736,"00:58:11,655","00:58:13,907","I want you all to leave
kahndaq and never return."
737,"00:58:13,990","00:58:17,828","Gladly,
with you as our prisoner."
738,"00:58:17,911","00:58:20,455","How 'bout I rip
your little wings off instead?"
739,"00:58:20,539","00:58:22,416",I'd like to see you try.
740,"00:58:22,499","00:58:23,939","Okay, more fighting
won't solve this."
741,"00:58:24,000","00:58:25,502","- I disagree.
- Me, too."
742,"00:58:25,585","00:58:27,045","Looks like we found
common ground."
743,"00:58:27,129","00:58:28,922",This can only end one way.
744,"00:58:30,549","00:58:31,967","- Mom?
- Amon."
745,"00:58:32,050","00:58:33,885","I got home and ishmael
was in the kitchen."
746,"00:58:33,969","00:58:35,387",Ishmael's dead.
747,"00:58:35,470","00:58:37,430","No, he shot uncle karim,
and he's after the crown."
748,"00:58:38,807","00:58:40,392",Ground forces...
749,"00:58:40,475","00:58:42,395","I'm hiding in our building,
and intergang's here."
750,"00:58:42,477","00:58:44,187",They're coming!
751,"00:58:44,271","00:58:46,273",Intergang are after my son.
752,"00:58:46,356","00:58:49,526","They don't want him,
they want the crown of sabbac."
753,"00:58:49,609","00:58:50,819",I know you're not a hero.
754,"00:58:50,902","00:58:52,088","But you're not a monster,
either."
755,"00:58:52,112","00:58:53,321",I don't care what anyone says.
756,"00:58:53,405","00:58:55,741",You saved me in that cave.
757,"00:58:55,824","00:58:58,744","You didn't know me and your
first instinct was to save me."
758,"00:58:58,827","00:59:01,455","I'm begging you.
Please, save my son."
759,"00:59:06,001","00:59:07,353",Check the whole place clean.
760,"00:59:07,377","00:59:09,463",Cover all access points!
761,"00:59:09,546","00:59:11,882",Keep looking!
762,"00:59:19,473","00:59:20,473",Area's clear.
763,"00:59:21,767","00:59:23,351","There! There!
Take him! Take him!"
764,"00:59:23,435","00:59:24,875","Right there, right there!"
765,"00:59:27,481","00:59:28,982","Move, move!"
766,"00:59:29,065","00:59:31,568","Don't shoot him, I need him!"
767,"00:59:40,160","00:59:41,920","He's going down,
he's going down!"
768,"00:59:49,544","00:59:50,796","End of the road, kid!"
769,"00:59:58,678","00:59:59,930",Release the child.
770,"01:00:00,013","01:00:01,431",Whatever you say.
771,"01:00:04,559","01:00:06,394",Yes! Thank you!
772,"01:00:06,478","01:00:09,231","But maybe be more careful
with your word choice next time."
773,"01:00:12,275","01:00:14,486","Oh! And remember
your catchphrase!"
774,"01:00:19,533","01:00:21,326","Time to go, amon."
775,"01:00:28,583","01:00:30,210","- Where's the crown?
- What crown?"
776,"01:00:30,293","01:00:32,838","- You want to be brave, eh?
- I want you to go to hell."
777,"01:00:32,921","01:00:34,297","That's the plan, little man."
778,"01:00:34,381","01:00:36,091","We're gonna go for a ride.
Come on."
779,"01:00:50,939","01:00:52,941",Put me down! Put me down!
780,"01:00:53,024","01:00:55,211","You should really be more careful
with your word choice next time."
781,"01:00:55,235","01:00:56,838","And tell them that
the man in black..."
782,"01:01:03,368","01:01:05,453","He's right behind me.
Where the hell is everybody?"
783,"01:01:16,006","01:01:17,257",Mom?
784,"01:01:17,340","01:01:20,135","Amon, where are you?
No, no, no. What?"
785,"01:01:20,218","01:01:21,928",I'm in one of their bikes.
786,"01:01:22,012","01:01:23,012",What bikes?
787,"01:01:42,198","01:01:43,366",Amon!
788,"01:01:43,450","01:01:44,284",Can you hear me?
789,"01:01:44,367","01:01:45,535","Mom, I'm okay."
790,"01:01:52,250","01:01:53,250",Shit!
791,"01:01:59,799","01:02:01,009",Activate infrared.
792,"01:02:07,140","01:02:08,200",What are you doing?
793,"01:02:08,224","01:02:09,601",Searching for the child.
794,"01:02:09,684","01:02:10,977","No, you're murdering people."
795,"01:02:11,061","01:02:12,687",How else do I find the child?
796,"01:02:12,771","01:02:14,940","I can help you, but no more
extrajudicial killings."
797,"01:02:15,023","01:02:16,775",I don't need any help.
798,"01:02:19,069","01:02:20,546","Smasher, cyclone!"
799,"01:02:20,570","01:02:21,988",What are you waiting for?
800,"01:02:22,072","01:02:24,157","- Come on, let's go!
- Uh, okay."
801,"01:02:24,240","01:02:26,326","Okay. I got this. I got this.
On the count of three."
802,"01:02:26,409","01:02:28,078","One, two..."
803,"01:02:28,161","01:02:30,288","This feels a lot higher
than last time."
804,"01:02:30,372","01:02:32,415",Whoa!
805,"01:02:32,499","01:02:33,750",Ah! That was not cool!
806,"01:02:42,509","01:02:44,229","Whoa, whoa, whoa. Hey."
807,"01:02:44,260","01:02:45,804","Hey, guys. Slow down."
808,"01:02:49,349","01:02:51,518",I got you! I got you!
809,"01:03:10,245","01:03:13,248","Hey, careful, dude!
I almost hit you."
810,"01:03:19,254","01:03:20,839",I am so sorry. I just...
811,"01:03:20,922","01:03:22,233","I don't really have
peripheral vision in the mask."
812,"01:03:22,257","01:03:23,925","It's my uncle's.
I'll get it tailored."
813,"01:03:24,009","01:03:25,260",Me and you.
814,"01:03:25,343","01:03:26,469",Roger that.
815,"01:04:11,222","01:04:13,391","- Who are you?
- Call me Dr. Fate."
816,"01:04:13,475","01:04:16,936","How bad is it, doc? Am I dying?"
817,"01:04:17,020","01:04:18,605",I'm not that kind of doctor.
818,"01:04:18,688","01:04:20,315","But don't worry,
I can see the future."
819,"01:04:20,398","01:04:22,442","This isn't how you're
going to die."
820,"01:04:22,525","01:04:23,777","How do I die, then?"
821,"01:04:23,860","01:04:25,570",Just stay away from electricity.
822,"01:04:25,653","01:04:28,656","Wait, what? I'm an electrician."
823,"01:04:28,740","01:04:30,220","How the hell
am I supposed to do that?"
824,"01:05:37,976","01:05:40,436","Oh, god."
825,"01:05:40,520","01:05:42,564","The champion's coming for you.
You know that, right?"
826,"01:05:42,647","01:05:43,647",I'm counting on it.
827,"01:05:55,285","01:05:56,953",Please don't.
828,"01:05:57,036","01:05:58,788",Teth Adam. Where are you?
829,"01:05:58,872","01:05:59,873",You followed me?
830,"01:05:59,956","01:06:01,666",My mind and body can exist
831,"01:06:01,749","01:06:03,751","in different places
at the same time."
832,"01:06:03,835","01:06:05,420",Did you find the boy?
833,"01:06:05,503","01:06:07,064","Caught one of the bikes,
but he didn't have the child."
834,"01:06:07,088","01:06:09,591","Bring me the prisoner.
I'll break his mind."
835,"01:06:09,674","01:06:10,675",Uh...
836,"01:06:12,302","01:06:14,137","You killed him, didn't you?"
837,"01:06:21,186","01:06:22,187",He didn't make it.
838,"01:06:25,231","01:06:26,471",The bullet's extracted.
839,"01:06:26,524","01:06:28,484","The tissue damage
has been repaired."
840,"01:06:28,568","01:06:32,947","Blood pressure, 120 over 81.
Heart rate's at 74 bpm."
841,"01:06:33,031","01:06:34,471","He'll be back on his feet
in no time."
842,"01:06:36,659","01:06:37,659",That is insane.
843,"01:06:38,995","01:06:40,997","The nanobots did
most of the work."
844,"01:06:41,080","01:06:43,291","No, no, no. I'm not gonna
let you downplay this."
845,"01:06:43,374","01:06:45,376","I literally just witnessed
a miracle."
846,"01:06:45,460","01:06:46,961",Mmm-mmm.
847,"01:06:47,045","01:06:48,713",What? I say something stupid?
848,"01:06:48,796","01:06:51,591","No, it's just you can transform
your molecular structure,"
849,"01:06:51,674","01:06:53,384","grow a hundred times
your own size."
850,"01:06:53,468","01:06:55,628","You're an impossibility
and the world still amazes you."
851,"01:06:55,678","01:06:57,180","I don't know, it's..."
852,"01:06:58,181","01:06:59,181",It's cool.
853,"01:07:00,391","01:07:02,477",Thank you.
854,"01:07:02,560","01:07:03,853","But it's not as cool
as nanobots."
855,"01:07:06,189","01:07:08,316","That's how you do
your wind thing."
856,"01:07:08,399","01:07:10,985","Well, the ""wind thing""
is called aerokinesis."
857,"01:07:11,069","01:07:13,005","And the nanobots were injected
into my bloodstream"
858,"01:07:13,029","01:07:14,489","by this really
messed-up scientist"
859,"01:07:14,572","01:07:15,949",who kidnapped me when I was 15.
860,"01:07:20,078","01:07:21,663",I'm... so sorry.
861,"01:07:22,872","01:07:24,249","No, you're good."
862,"01:07:24,332","01:07:26,084","It seems like you
really turned it around."
863,"01:07:26,167","01:07:27,502",Found your calling.
864,"01:07:28,920","01:07:29,963",Hoping this is mine.
865,"01:07:36,386","01:07:38,388","There's no point
in dwelling in the past."
866,"01:07:41,140","01:07:42,809",It's already moved on from you.
867,"01:07:47,105","01:07:48,564",Why did you say that?
868,"01:07:48,648","01:07:51,192","You were blaming yourself
for trusting ishmael."
869,"01:07:51,276","01:07:54,445","Your thoughts are better spent
on the things you can change,"
870,"01:07:54,529","01:07:55,613",not those you can't.
871,"01:07:56,948","01:07:58,741",You see the future?
872,"01:07:58,825","01:08:00,618",Tell me how I get my son back.
873,"01:08:02,036","01:08:03,204",By trusting us.
874,"01:08:03,288","01:08:06,582","Karim will live.
We will save amon."
875,"01:08:06,666","01:08:07,750",It's what we do.
876,"01:08:12,964","01:08:15,300","I suppose they didn't
have doors in your day."
877,"01:08:15,383","01:08:18,720","Well, of course we did.
That's how we entered rooms."
878,"01:08:18,803","01:08:20,805","What I did there
is called sarcasm."
879,"01:08:20,888","01:08:23,057","Where is amon?
Did you find him?"
880,"01:08:23,141","01:08:24,350","Not yet, but I will."
881,"01:08:24,434","01:08:25,714","The men who took him
will suffer."
882,"01:08:27,520","01:08:28,560",Maybe these guys can help.
883,"01:08:30,732","01:08:33,234","There's an upside
to keeping prisoners."
884,"01:08:33,318","01:08:35,111",They can answer our questions.
885,"01:08:35,194","01:08:36,571",What did you do with my son?
886,"01:08:45,288","01:08:47,832",Adrianna. Adrianna.
887,"01:08:47,915","01:08:49,542","I've learned that
in this modern world,"
888,"01:08:49,625","01:08:51,044",we shouldn't hurt our prisoners.
889,"01:08:51,127","01:08:52,807","We should treat them
with dignity, respect."
890,"01:08:54,130","01:08:56,132",No.
891,"01:08:56,215","01:08:58,110","Let's start with
just one simple question."
892,"01:08:58,134","01:09:00,970",Can either of you fly?
893,"01:09:01,054","01:09:02,555",Shit.
894,"01:09:04,307","01:09:05,725",I think I'll sit this one out.
895,"01:09:13,066","01:09:15,693",Tell me what you did with amon.
896,"01:09:15,777","01:09:17,987","You'd better not drop
those prisoners."
897,"01:09:18,071","01:09:19,530",I'm not going to drop them.
898,"01:09:21,616","01:09:23,159",I'm going to drop one of them.
899,"01:09:23,242","01:09:25,620","Whoever answers first lives.
Where is he?"
900,"01:09:25,703","01:09:27,288",I don't know.
901,"01:09:33,628","01:09:35,296",He's at our mine in the desert.
902,"01:09:35,380","01:09:36,839",I can show...
903,"01:09:42,220","01:09:44,013","Oh, you gotta be kidding me."
904,"01:09:46,432","01:09:48,032","You said you wouldn't hurt
the prisoners."
905,"01:09:48,059","01:09:49,852",That was sarcasm.
906,"01:09:49,936","01:09:52,313","No, technically,
it was just a lie."
907,"01:09:52,397","01:09:53,791","Intergang have a mine
in the desert."
908,"01:09:53,815","01:09:55,108","- Amon is there.
- I know it."
909,"01:09:55,191","01:09:57,402","It's near
the al hadidiyah mountains."
910,"01:09:57,485","01:09:58,486",Let's go.
911,"01:10:00,071","01:10:02,198","I told you, stop killing people!"
912,"01:10:02,281","01:10:03,199",They look alive to me.
913,"01:10:03,282","01:10:05,159",Because I saved them.
914,"01:10:05,243","01:10:06,970","Well, that's why I waited
until you were there."
915,"01:10:06,994","01:10:09,038","I got the information I needed,
no one died."
916,"01:10:10,123","01:10:11,416",I did it your way.
917,"01:10:11,499","01:10:12,542",He does have a point.
918,"01:10:14,001","01:10:15,878","I know it got lost
in all the confusion,"
919,"01:10:15,962","01:10:18,673","but we still have some issues
to settle here."
920,"01:10:18,756","01:10:20,258","We know where amon is.
We have to go."
921,"01:10:20,341","01:10:21,968","There is no ""we"" here."
922,"01:10:22,051","01:10:25,096","There are only heroes
and there are villains."
923,"01:10:26,389","01:10:27,932","You think yourself a hero,"
924,"01:10:28,015","01:10:29,618","but you would let
these criminals go free,"
925,"01:10:29,642","01:10:31,644","knowing that many more
will suffer at their hands"
926,"01:10:31,727","01:10:32,812",unless we end them now.
927,"01:10:32,895","01:10:35,565",Heroes don't kill people.
928,"01:10:39,360","01:10:40,360","Well, I do."
929,"01:10:41,904","01:10:42,947",Here we go.
930,"01:11:44,383","01:11:47,386",Is that what I think it is?
931,"01:11:47,470","01:11:49,388","Twenty-three pounds
of pure eternium,"
932,"01:11:49,472","01:11:51,891","much denser than typical
artifacts of the period."
933,"01:11:51,974","01:11:53,726","King must have had
a really strong neck."
934,"01:11:53,809","01:11:55,603","No, it snapped
when I killed him."
935,"01:11:57,813","01:11:59,232",What's that?
936,"01:11:59,315","01:12:00,876","There's writing on the inside
of the rim."
937,"01:12:00,900","01:12:03,027","""Life is the only path
to death."""
938,"01:12:04,028","01:12:05,238",That's what it says.
939,"01:12:05,321","01:12:08,491","""Life is the only path
to death."""
940,"01:12:08,574","01:12:11,619","Well, that's
surprisingly obvious."
941,"01:12:11,702","01:12:13,371",Could it have another meaning?
942,"01:12:13,454","01:12:15,414","What if it means, like, um..."
943,"01:12:15,498","01:12:17,708","""Life is short."
944,"01:12:17,792","01:12:19,192","You gotta hold on
to what you love."""
945,"01:12:21,128","01:12:22,128",Stop.
946,"01:12:22,713","01:12:23,839",Deep.
947,"01:12:23,923","01:12:25,508",It doesn't matter what it means.
948,"01:12:25,591","01:12:27,361","It should be buried
under the ocean for eternity."
949,"01:12:27,385","01:12:29,095","That's not far from what
we had in mind"
950,"01:12:29,178","01:12:30,596",for you when this is over.
951,"01:12:30,680","01:12:32,098",Or I could Bury you with it.
952,"01:12:33,766","01:12:35,601",We can't get rid of it now.
953,"01:12:35,685","01:12:37,311","It's the one thing
that intergang wants."
954,"01:12:37,395","01:12:40,106","Believe me,
I know more than anyone"
955,"01:12:40,189","01:12:41,732",what this crown is capable of.
956,"01:12:41,816","01:12:44,819","But we have to keep it
until my son is safe."
957,"01:12:44,902","01:12:46,112",Adrianna...
958,"01:12:46,195","01:12:47,947","Trust me,
we will get your son back."
959,"01:12:48,030","01:12:50,741","They don't care about him.
They just want to defeat me."
960,"01:12:50,825","01:12:52,034",Hand it over.
961,"01:12:53,911","01:12:57,331","We can't risk letting the crown
fall into the wrong hands."
962,"01:12:58,708","01:13:00,418",We'll find another way.
963,"01:13:01,752","01:13:03,546",No.
964,"01:13:03,629","01:13:06,257","You like to split the world
into good and bad,"
965,"01:13:06,340","01:13:09,719","but that's easy to do when
you're the one drawing the line."
966,"01:13:09,802","01:13:11,679",All I care about is amon.
967,"01:13:11,762","01:13:15,850","And until he is safe,
we're all on the same side."
968,"01:13:15,933","01:13:19,061","And you...
You will work together."
969,"01:13:26,527","01:13:29,322","Set a course
for the al hadidiyah mountains."
970,"01:13:29,405","01:13:30,698",We'll go in at dawn.
971,"01:13:32,074","01:13:33,993",I hope you can be a team player.
972,"01:13:34,076","01:13:36,245",I love teams.
973,"01:13:36,329","01:13:37,913","That was sarcasm again, yes?"
974,"01:13:37,997","01:13:38,914",Very much so.
975,"01:13:38,998","01:13:41,334",Good. Just checking.
976,"01:13:51,886","01:13:54,305","A wise man
once told me a bad plan"
977,"01:13:54,388","01:13:55,806",is better than no plan at all.
978,"01:13:55,890","01:13:59,060","That was before we had
a very bad plan."
979,"01:13:59,143","01:14:01,062",Let it go.
980,"01:14:01,145","01:14:03,648","I'd rather be fighting with him
than against him."
981,"01:14:03,731","01:14:05,566","He's a murderer, Kent."
982,"01:14:05,650","01:14:09,028","If he turns on us,
that kid is as good as dead."
983,"01:14:09,111","01:14:12,073","You don't get to decide
who lives or dies."
984,"01:14:13,324","01:14:15,409",That's... up to fate.
985,"01:14:15,493","01:14:16,952",What's the helmet telling you?
986,"01:14:18,120","01:14:19,205",Somebody's gonna die.
987,"01:14:20,748","01:14:23,376","Who is it, atom smasher?
It's atom smasher."
988,"01:14:23,459","01:14:24,585","Surprisingly, no."
989,"01:14:25,878","01:14:26,878",Is it me?
990,"01:14:33,177","01:14:36,597","When it's time for you and I
to say goodbye, you'll know."
991,"01:14:39,517","01:14:40,851","All I can tell you is,"
992,"01:14:43,145","01:14:45,398","there's still time
to change the future."
993,"01:14:46,649","01:14:47,733",Let's use it.
994,"01:14:48,651","01:14:49,652",Hmm.
995,"01:14:53,406","01:14:56,158","Well, I guess we're sticking
with the very bad plan."
996,"01:15:08,671","01:15:09,964",The al hadidiyah mine
997,"01:15:10,047","01:15:13,592","is intergang's
most valued asset."
998,"01:15:13,676","01:15:15,010","I'm gonna land us right here,"
999,"01:15:15,094","01:15:17,221","cut off their access
to reinforcements."
1000,"01:15:17,304","01:15:20,307","But the perimeter of the mine
creates a natural fortress."
1001,"01:15:20,391","01:15:22,852","There's only one way in,
one way out."
1002,"01:15:22,935","01:15:24,663","We'll be an easy target
for their flybike patrol."
1003,"01:15:24,687","01:15:26,397",Communication is key.
1004,"01:15:26,480","01:15:28,899","We keep in step
or we get outflanked."
1005,"01:15:28,983","01:15:31,193","We move through the mine,
inch by inch,"
1006,"01:15:31,277","01:15:32,778",until we find amon.
1007,"01:15:32,862","01:15:34,902","This is where you come in.
Are you ready... damn it."

1023,"01:16:37,718","01:16:38,718",I have it.

1025,"01:16:42,932","01:16:45,684","Release my son, you can have it."
1026,"01:16:48,729","01:16:50,147",What do you think you're doing?
1027,"01:16:51,774","01:16:54,235",Intergang killed my husband.
1028,"01:16:54,318","01:16:56,070","I'm not letting them
take my son, too."
1029,"01:17:01,742","01:17:04,286",Not your son. Not your country.
1030,"01:17:05,913","01:17:07,122",Not your decision to make.
1031,"01:17:08,624","01:17:10,084",Stop there!
1032,"01:17:10,167","01:17:12,962","It's okay.
Nothing is gonna happen to you."
1033,"01:17:13,045","01:17:14,171","Hand it over, now."
1034,"01:17:15,422","01:17:16,465","I'm sorry, mom."
1035,"01:17:16,549","01:17:17,633",No.
1036,"01:17:23,472","01:17:24,890","Now, let amon go."
1037,"01:17:31,188","01:17:33,028","I thank you.
And I thank your friends"
1038,"01:17:33,107","01:17:36,902","for returning the crown
to its rightful owner."
1039,"01:17:36,986","01:17:40,656","What kind of champion of
kahndaq sides with foreign invaders?"
1040,"01:17:40,739","01:17:41,991",You have what you want.
1041,"01:17:43,200","01:17:44,451",Let him go.
1042,"01:17:44,535","01:17:45,828","Ishmael, what are you doing?"
1043,"01:17:45,911","01:17:48,622",Taking back what's mine.
1044,"01:17:48,706","01:17:51,584","I'm the last living descendant
of king ahk-ton the great."
1045,"01:17:51,667","01:17:54,253","And you have just given me
everything I need"
1046,"01:17:54,336","01:17:57,882","to become the next
king of kahndaq."
1047,"01:17:59,550","01:18:01,510","My family passed
the knowledge on, you know,"
1048,"01:18:01,594","01:18:03,304",one to the next.
1049,"01:18:03,387","01:18:06,599","The crown,
crafted by our ancestors,"
1050,"01:18:06,682","01:18:09,351","stolen by the wizards
and hidden away."
1051,"01:18:09,435","01:18:11,228","But still a source
of great power,"
1052,"01:18:11,312","01:18:13,856",if only we can wield it.
1053,"01:18:19,028","01:18:23,574","They say when hurut died,
you wept like a baby."
1054,"01:18:25,075","01:18:26,595","I wonder if you'll
do the same for them."
1055,"01:18:26,619","01:18:27,619","Please, ishmael."
1056,"01:18:27,661","01:18:28,829","Sorry, amon."
1057,"01:18:31,498","01:18:32,999","Fate, get ready."
1058,"01:18:33,083","01:18:37,171",Death is the only path to life.
1059,"01:18:41,091","01:18:42,426",Amon!
1060,"01:19:48,617","01:19:49,785",Amon!
1061,"01:19:52,913","01:19:54,707",He's alive.
1062,"01:19:54,790","01:19:56,500","But we need to get him
to the medical bay."
1063,"01:19:56,583","01:19:58,183","- Where is he shot?
- It wasn't a bullet."
1064,"01:19:58,252","01:19:59,252",It was me.
1065,"01:20:08,554","01:20:09,554",Come.
1066,"01:20:19,314","01:20:21,275",We're going with you.
1067,"01:20:21,358","01:20:23,485","Just find the crown.
Get it on the cruiser."
1068,"01:20:36,331","01:20:39,209","I found the crown.
But, um... it's not alone."
1069,"01:20:50,804","01:20:52,681","How long we gonna
keep doing this?"
1070,"01:20:56,351","01:20:59,605","There's no point in fighting. We
both know no one can stop me."
1071,"01:21:01,315","01:21:02,441",You're right.
1072,"01:21:03,650","01:21:05,944",Only you can.
1073,"01:21:06,028","01:21:08,781","Ishmael said you cried
when hurut died."
1074,"01:21:13,577","01:21:14,745",Who's hurut?
1075,"01:21:20,250","01:21:22,169","Hurut was a true champion
of kahndaq."
1076,"01:21:28,175","01:21:30,427",And he was also... my son.
1077,"01:21:32,721","01:21:34,949","I won't always be here
to protect you."
1078,"01:21:34,973","01:21:38,268","I don't need protection.
I want to be free."
1079,"01:21:40,062","01:21:41,271",Freedom is for the birds.
1080,"01:21:41,355","01:21:44,316",Let someone else be the hero...
1081,"01:21:44,399","01:21:47,319",The graveyards are full of them.
1082,"01:21:52,282","01:21:54,094",I tried to protect him.
1083,"01:22:01,625","01:22:03,145",But I wasn't strong enough.
1084,"01:22:07,756","01:22:11,093",Shazam!
1085,"01:22:11,176","01:22:14,930","The wizards decided that
he would be their champion."
1086,"01:22:15,013","01:22:17,349","But after the champion's
many victories,"
1087,"01:22:17,432","01:22:20,310","the king went after
what hurut loved the most."
1088,"01:22:22,354","01:22:24,439",Our family.
1089,"01:22:41,874","01:22:45,294","Hold on, father.
Stay with me."
1090,"01:22:52,551","01:22:57,181","With my powers...
You'll be safe."
1091,"01:22:57,264","01:22:59,183",I couldn't protect your mother.
1092,"01:23:00,225","01:23:02,603",Repeat what I say.
1093,"01:23:03,562","01:23:04,688","- Shazam.
- Shazam."
1094,"01:23:17,784","01:23:19,944",Instead of battling the king...
1095,"01:23:20,954","01:23:22,831",Instead of saving kahndaq...
1096,"01:23:24,291","01:23:25,959",Hurut chose to save...
1097,"01:23:27,336","01:23:28,336",Me.
1098,"01:23:45,437","01:23:47,522",But he couldn't save himself
1099,"01:23:47,606","01:23:49,983",from the king's assassins.
1100,"01:23:52,527","01:23:55,113","The powers were not a gift
from the wizards..."
1101,"01:23:56,156","01:23:57,156",But a curse.
1102,"01:24:07,376","01:24:09,962",Born... out of rage.
1103,"01:24:12,923","01:24:14,883","The statue of the champion
isn't you."
1104,"01:24:18,136","01:24:19,221",It's hurut.
1105,"01:24:22,391","01:24:24,268",My son dreamt of a better world.
1106,"01:24:25,727","01:24:27,062",That's why he saved me.
1107,"01:24:32,067","01:24:34,152","But the world was only
a better place with him in it."
1108,"01:24:50,460","01:24:51,837",Kahndaq needed a hero.
1109,"01:24:53,630","01:24:55,215","Instead, it got me."
1110,"01:24:58,218","01:24:59,553",All this power...
1111,"01:25:01,305","01:25:04,599","And the only thing I can
do with it is hurt people."
1112,"01:25:04,683","01:25:07,185","I will speak the word
my son gave me,"
1113,"01:25:07,269","01:25:08,687",and I will give up my power.
1114,"01:25:11,481","01:25:15,027","And when I do, you must ensure
I never speak it again."
1115,"01:25:20,907","01:25:22,200",Shazam.
1116,"01:25:30,083","01:25:33,670","Some men
are not meant... to be heroes."
1117,"01:26:18,882","01:26:20,217",Hey!
1118,"01:26:38,360","01:26:40,362",So beautiful.
1119,"01:27:06,805","01:27:08,390",Surprised to see us?
1120,"01:27:08,473","01:27:11,476","Surprise is a dirty word
in this business."
1121,"01:27:11,560","01:27:13,061",Are you sure you can handle him?
1122,"01:27:14,563","01:27:16,040","You're the one who can
see the future,"
1123,"01:27:16,064","01:27:17,315",you'll tell me if we can't.
1124,"01:27:17,399","01:27:19,860",Just be careful with this one.
1125,"01:27:19,943","01:27:22,362","You know,
they say the gods created us,"
1126,"01:27:22,446","01:27:24,865","but we're the ones who
always wind up burying them."
1127,"01:27:26,825","01:27:28,243",Waller sends her regards.
1128,"01:27:35,333","01:27:37,294","They'll know
how to deal with him."
1129,"01:27:37,377","01:27:40,005","To keep him
from regaining his powers,"
1130,"01:27:40,088","01:27:41,923","they'll keep him
in suspended animation."
1131,"01:27:49,639","01:27:52,893","As long as he's submerged,
he won't be able to speak."
1132,"01:27:57,856","01:27:59,524","He'll never say
another word again."
1133,"01:28:19,044","01:28:21,505",Hey! There he is.
1134,"01:28:21,588","01:28:25,175","Not all heroes wear capes,
but I think you earned this."
1135,"01:28:25,258","01:28:26,885","Well, statistically,"
1136,"01:28:26,968","01:28:29,054","most heroes don't wear capes.
But, yeah, try it on."
1137,"01:28:32,682","01:28:34,726","Yeah, looks pretty good."
1138,"01:28:37,437","01:28:39,064",That's a nice touch.
1139,"01:29:19,604","01:29:20,604",Kent.
1140,"01:29:22,274","01:29:23,400",Kent!
1141,"01:29:26,736","01:29:27,862",Mission accomplished?
1142,"01:29:27,946","01:29:30,240",My vision hasn't changed.
1143,"01:29:30,323","01:29:32,492","But teth Adam's
out of the equation."
1144,"01:29:32,576","01:29:35,245","Kent, if this isn't over,
I need to know what's coming."
1145,"01:29:35,328","01:29:36,955",What is the helmet telling you?
1146,"01:29:38,582","01:29:41,876","My vision has always shown me
a great calamity."
1147,"01:29:41,960","01:29:44,004",The world in flames.
1148,"01:29:44,087","01:29:45,380",We can stop it...
1149,"01:29:47,215","01:29:48,216",But you die.
1150,"01:29:50,719","01:29:51,970",You should've told me sooner.
1151,"01:29:55,348","01:29:57,183",I have no fear of death.
1152,"01:29:57,267","01:29:59,269","That's precisely
why I didn't tell you."
1153,"01:29:59,352","01:30:01,605","The world needs
the justice society."
1154,"01:30:01,688","01:30:03,523",The world needs you.
1155,"01:30:03,607","01:30:06,526","But you can't choose
who lives and dies."
1156,"01:30:06,610","01:30:07,610","That's fate, right?"
1157,"01:30:10,989","01:30:12,407",That sounds familiar.
1158,"01:30:15,410","01:30:17,287","I remember seeing
my first airplane."
1159,"01:30:19,122","01:30:24,044","It was an raf deployment,
headed to the western front."
1160,"01:30:24,127","01:30:26,338","Everyone on my street
came out to see them off."
1161,"01:30:26,963","01:30:28,673",Mmm.
1162,"01:30:28,757","01:30:29,841",But I didn't cheer.
1163,"01:30:31,843","01:30:34,512",Even though I was only a boy.
1164,"01:30:34,596","01:30:39,100","I knew where they were headed,
and what awaited them."
1165,"01:30:39,184","01:30:40,602","Thanks to this,
I've lived longer"
1166,"01:30:40,685","01:30:42,854","than I could've
ever have hoped for."
1167,"01:30:42,937","01:30:44,522",I've seen the world change
1168,"01:30:44,606","01:30:46,566","in more ways
than I could've imagined."
1169,"01:30:49,819","01:30:51,696",I'm still a sentimental fool.
1170,"01:30:53,239","01:30:54,991","And I don't want
my friend to die."
1171,"01:31:03,208","01:31:08,088","Ishmael said, ""death
is the only path to life."""
1172,"01:31:08,171","01:31:10,382","But that's not
what the inscription says."
1173,"01:31:10,465","01:31:13,760","Right. ""Life is
the only path to death."""
1174,"01:31:13,843","01:31:15,261","Maybe he got it backwards,"
1175,"01:31:15,345","01:31:17,597","like he read it in a mirror
or something."
1176,"01:31:17,681","01:31:19,182",That's it.
1177,"01:31:19,265","01:31:21,559","In kahndaqi mythology,
the souls of the damned"
1178,"01:31:21,643","01:31:23,728","are sent
to the rock of finality."
1179,"01:31:23,812","01:31:25,897","The underworld
is a mirror to our own."
1180,"01:31:25,980","01:31:27,732","Here, turn the crown around."
1181,"01:31:29,401","01:31:30,694",Now mirror the letters.
1182,"01:31:30,777","01:31:33,822",See? That's what I missed.
1183,"01:31:33,905","01:31:37,909","""Death is
the only path to life."""
1184,"01:31:41,871","01:31:44,165","He kidnapped amon on purpose,"
1185,"01:31:44,249","01:31:46,751","because he knew
that teth Adam would kill him."
1186,"01:31:46,835","01:31:48,878","And he believed
the champion's magic"
1187,"01:31:48,962","01:31:50,797","would send him
to the rock of finality."
1188,"01:31:50,880","01:31:54,426",As life is the path to death.
1189,"01:31:54,509","01:31:58,263","Now your death
is a path to life."
1190,"01:31:58,346","01:32:00,432","The wizards have their champion,"
1191,"01:32:00,515","01:32:02,642",now we have ours.
1192,"01:32:02,726","01:32:05,478","You will take
the throne of kahndaq"
1193,"01:32:05,562","01:32:09,607",and unleash hell on earth!
1194,"01:32:09,691","01:32:11,776",Speak our name.

1196,"01:32:34,799","01:32:36,801",What the bloody hell is that?
1197,"01:32:36,885","01:32:38,645","Readout says
it's the demon, sabbac."
1198,"01:32:38,678","01:32:41,014","Get me closer. Now, right now!"
1199,"01:32:41,097","01:32:42,807","We're 100 miles out,
give me 20 seconds!"
1200,"01:32:50,315","01:32:55,695","The king has returned!
The throne will be mine!"
1201,"01:32:58,198","01:32:59,407",Brace yourselves!
1202,"01:33:05,371","01:33:06,498",Hold on!
1203,"01:33:43,535","01:33:44,845",Now prepare to die.
1204,"01:33:51,042","01:33:52,322","Wait, wait, where's uncle karim?"
1205,"01:34:09,227","01:34:12,230","No matter what happens,
he does not sit on that throne."
1206,"01:34:15,692","01:34:17,336","- Copy that.
- We're on it!"
1207,"01:34:17,360","01:34:18,360",Heads up!
1208,"01:35:03,156","01:35:04,240",Activate infrared.
1209,"01:35:08,077","01:35:09,829","Sabbac, show yourself!"
1210,"01:35:12,248","01:35:15,084",Adrianna! Amon!
1211,"01:35:19,464","01:35:20,924",That's for my cruiser.
1212,"01:35:59,545","01:36:00,546",This is it.
1213,"01:36:02,048","01:36:03,675","We can't win, Carter."
1214,"01:36:03,758","01:36:06,761","Yeah, but the world burns
if we don't. Right?"
1215,"01:36:09,013","01:36:11,265","Bad plan is better than
no plan at all."
1216,"01:36:38,251","01:36:40,253","No, no, no. What are you doing?"
1217,"01:36:40,336","01:36:42,130",Giving us a third option.
1218,"01:36:42,213","01:36:43,631",It's supposed to be me.
1219,"01:36:43,715","01:36:45,842","I didn't tell you
my whole vision, old friend."
1220,"01:36:46,884","01:36:48,302",I did see your death.
1221,"01:36:48,386","01:36:50,763","But I also found a way
to prevent it."
1222,"01:36:50,847","01:36:52,890","It has been
an extraordinary life,"
1223,"01:36:52,974","01:36:55,309","but always with one foot
in the future."
1224,"01:36:55,393","01:36:58,604","Carter, for the first time
in 100 years,"
1225,"01:36:58,688","01:36:59,856",when I look ahead...
1226,"01:37:02,608","01:37:03,818",I see nothing.
1227,"01:37:03,901","01:37:04,902","No, Kent."
1228,"01:37:04,986","01:37:05,986",And...
1229,"01:37:06,946","01:37:07,947",It's...
1230,"01:37:08,948","01:37:09,782",Beautiful.
1231,"01:37:09,866","01:37:10,908","Wait, Kent!"
1232,"01:37:10,992","01:37:12,118",Goodbye...
1233,"01:37:12,201","01:37:13,911",Kent!
1234,"01:37:13,995","01:37:15,079",My dear friend.
1235,"01:37:15,163","01:37:16,247",Kent!
1236,"01:37:19,042","01:37:20,418",Hit it from every side.
1237,"01:37:22,253","01:37:24,547",Kent!
1238,"01:37:27,258","01:37:28,342",No!
1239,"01:37:48,071","01:37:53,201","I am Dr. Fate, sorcerer,
agent of the lords of order,"
1240,"01:37:53,284","01:37:56,329","defender against darkness
and chaos,"
1241,"01:37:56,412","01:37:58,915","but even my powers
cannot defeat you."
1242,"01:38:09,092","01:38:11,385","There's no one
that can defeat me."
1243,"01:38:15,807","01:38:19,560",There is one... there is one...
1244,"01:38:20,228","01:38:21,312",Teth Adam.
1245,"01:38:22,772","01:38:24,315",I know you can hear me.
1246,"01:38:26,275","01:38:30,071","The battle your son
was meant to fight is upon us."
1247,"01:38:30,154","01:38:32,448",Now you are the only one
1248,"01:38:32,532","01:38:34,742","who can defeat
the demon champion."
1249,"01:39:00,935","01:39:02,270",You have the power
1250,"01:39:02,353","01:39:04,480","to be the destroyer
of this world."
1251,"01:39:07,650","01:39:10,403",But you can also be its savior.
1252,"01:39:27,420","01:39:30,256","You believe
you are not a worthy champion"
1253,"01:39:30,339","01:39:32,925","because the wizards
did not choose you."
1254,"01:39:33,009","01:39:36,721","But fate does not make
mistakes. Neither did your son."
1255,"01:39:40,892","01:39:42,518",We were wrong about you.
1256,"01:39:42,602","01:39:45,855","The world doesn't always need
a white knight."
1257,"01:39:45,938","01:39:47,940","Sometimes it needs
something darker."
1258,"01:40:04,081","01:40:06,626","Don't you dare
give up on us now."
1259,"01:40:06,709","01:40:08,211",The world needs you.
1260,"01:41:15,319","01:41:16,319",Kent!
1261,"01:41:26,038","01:41:27,081",No!
1262,"01:42:31,687","01:42:34,023",Mom? What's happening?
1263,"01:42:36,484","01:42:38,235",It's sabbac.
1264,"01:42:38,319","01:42:40,363",He commands the legions of hell.
1265,"01:42:40,446","01:42:41,447",Whatever happens...
1266,"01:42:43,324","01:42:44,658",You stay behind me.
1267,"01:42:55,711","01:42:56,837","♪ Baby, come back ♪"

I die by electricity!"
1269,"01:43:03,344","01:43:06,138","You want some kahndaq?
Come and get it!"
1270,"01:43:06,222","01:43:07,890",Come and get it!
1271,"01:43:07,973","01:43:09,433","No, no. No."
1272,"01:43:09,517","01:43:11,602","- Don't send me home, I can help.
- I know."
1273,"01:43:11,685","01:43:13,521","But you can do better
than swinging a stick."
1274,"01:43:52,351","01:43:55,521","The gods
have brought us together again."
1275,"01:43:57,481","01:44:00,151","It's not your time, father."
1276,"01:44:03,237","01:44:04,237",Hey!
1277,"01:44:05,614","01:44:07,054","What are you all
standing around for?"
1278,"01:44:08,242","01:44:09,285",This is our chance.
1279,"01:44:12,913","01:44:15,958","With these hands,
we built kahndaq."
1280,"01:44:16,041","01:44:18,127","And with these hands,
we will set it free!"
1281,"01:44:24,383","01:44:26,093",The people need a hero.
1282,"01:44:27,970","01:44:32,141","No, father.
They need to be free."
1283,"01:44:36,270","01:44:37,480",What are we waiting for?
1284,"01:45:00,628","01:45:02,671",Say the word.
1285,"01:45:03,714","01:45:05,174",Shazam.
1286,"01:45:15,851","01:45:18,646","The people of kahndaq
rise up against you!"
1287,"01:45:47,383","01:45:48,383",Yes!
1288,"01:45:51,470","01:45:53,556",I got this.
1289,"01:45:55,558","01:45:56,558",Go get him.
1290,"01:46:14,368","01:46:15,869",You know what I have to do.
1291,"01:46:17,705","01:46:19,206",Beat his ass!
1292,"01:46:19,290","01:46:21,500","Let the fate of kahndaq
be decided"
1293,"01:46:21,584","01:46:24,378",by a true battle of champions.
1294,"01:46:25,254","01:46:26,254",Let's end this.
1295,"01:46:52,865","01:46:54,074",It's a lot of them.
1296,"01:46:55,701","01:46:57,661","- It's a bit more than I thought.
- Yeah."
1297,"01:46:58,412","01:46:59,872",Just a bit.
1298,"01:47:07,296","01:47:08,296","Hey, mom!"
1299,"01:47:15,971","01:47:19,016","These are our streets!
Our city!"
1300,"01:47:20,809","01:47:22,936",Free kahndaq!
1301,"01:47:30,611","01:47:33,197","The wizards' powers
were wasted on you."
1302,"01:47:33,280","01:47:35,240",You are not a hero.
1303,"01:47:37,910","01:47:40,371",No. I'm not.
1304,"01:47:41,789","01:47:44,124",But he is.
1305,"01:47:55,552","01:47:57,763",You cannot stand against me.
1306,"01:47:57,846","01:48:00,057",I am kahndaq's true champion.
1307,"01:48:10,109","01:48:12,194","I learned this trick
from an old friend."
1308,"01:48:51,859","01:48:53,193",You can control it!
1309,"01:48:57,448","01:48:58,782",You have to!
1310,"01:49:10,043","01:49:11,587","Tell them
the man in black sent you."
1311,"01:49:37,321","01:49:38,906","- Yes!
- Yes!"
1312,"01:50:02,137","01:50:04,681","I never thought I'd be happy
to see you."
1313,"01:50:07,851","01:50:09,186",I'm only here because of him.
1314,"01:50:12,564","01:50:14,274",That makes two of us.
1315,"01:50:31,708","01:50:33,544","See you around, old friend."
1316,"01:50:48,892","01:50:50,372","Think you can keep him
out of trouble?"
1317,"01:50:50,435","01:50:52,354","As long as no one
comes looking for it."
1318,"01:50:52,437","01:50:53,480",Fair enough.
1319,"01:50:55,482","01:50:57,317",Just be careful.
1320,"01:50:57,401","01:51:00,362","The kind of justice you dish
out can darken your soul."
1321,"01:51:00,445","01:51:02,865","It's his darkness
that lets him do"
1322,"01:51:02,948","01:51:05,576",what heroes like you cannot.
1323,"01:51:07,452","01:51:09,079","I guess we'll find out,
won't we?"
1324,"01:51:17,713","01:51:20,090","I thought we made
a pretty good team back there."
1325,"01:51:20,173","01:51:21,173",Just saying.
1326,"01:51:22,885","01:51:23,969",We made a great team.
1327,"01:51:30,350","01:51:32,269","- Maybe we could...
- Don't push it."
1328,"01:51:32,352","01:51:33,604","Smasher, let's go."
1329,"01:51:45,824","01:51:48,201",Long live the champion!
1330,"01:51:48,285","01:51:53,332","Long live the champion!
Long live the champion!"
1331,"01:51:55,751","01:51:56,919",You could lead them.
1332,"01:52:30,953","01:52:32,037",How does it feel?
1333,"01:52:34,247","01:52:35,247",Wrong.
1334,"01:52:46,635","01:52:48,762","So, what now?"
1335,"01:52:48,845","01:52:51,139","Does this mean you're finally
gonna be our hero?"
1336,"01:52:51,223","01:52:53,100",Kahndaq has always had heroes.
1337,"01:52:54,434","01:52:56,645",And it still does.
1338,"01:52:56,728","01:52:59,272","What it needs now
is a protector."
1339,"01:52:59,356","01:53:01,108","Thank you, teth Adam."
1340,"01:53:01,191","01:53:04,194",Perhaps that name is a little...
1341,"01:53:04,277","01:53:05,278",Old-fashioned.
1342,"01:53:06,613","01:53:07,693",So what should we call you?
1343,"01:56:03,623","01:56:05,417","Okay, ""black Adam."""
1344,"01:56:06,585","01:56:08,670",My name is Amanda waller.
1345,"01:56:08,753","01:56:11,423","Congratulations,
you have my attention."
1346,"01:56:11,506","01:56:15,427","This is gonna be
your only warning."
1347,"01:56:15,510","01:56:18,346","You don't want to stay
in my prison, that's fine."
1348,"01:56:18,430","01:56:21,016",Kahndaq is your prison now.
1349,"01:56:21,099","01:56:24,811","You step one foot outside of
it, you will not live to regret it."
1350,"01:56:27,063","01:56:29,149","There's no one on this planet
that can stop me."
1351,"01:56:29,232","01:56:31,032","I can call in a favor
and send people"
1352,"01:56:31,109","01:56:32,819",who aren't from this planet.
1353,"01:56:34,988","01:56:35,988",Send them all.
1354,"01:56:38,074","01:56:39,159",As you wish.
1355,"01:56:54,216","01:56:57,636","It's been a while since anyone's
made the world this nervous."
1356,"01:57:03,725","01:57:04,725",Black Adam.
1357,"01:57:06,269","01:57:07,270",We should talk.
