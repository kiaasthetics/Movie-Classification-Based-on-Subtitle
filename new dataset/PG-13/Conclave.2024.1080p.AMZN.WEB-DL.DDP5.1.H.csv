1,"00:03:27,458","00:03:28,667",He is with God.
2,"00:04:24,390","00:04:26,517",The throne of the Holy See
3,"00:04:27,977","00:04:28,977",is vacant.
4,"00:04:51,041","00:04:52,084",Aldo.
5,"00:04:56,255","00:04:58,632","Hey, do you think that anybody
would mind"
6,"00:04:58,757","00:05:01,927","if I took that, as a keepsake?
- Of course, take it."
7,"00:05:02,052","00:05:03,804","He would've wanted you to
have it."
8,"00:05:03,929","00:05:07,016","Because we used to play quite often in
the evenings."
9,"00:05:07,349","00:05:10,519","He said... it helped him
to relax."
10,"00:05:10,644","00:05:11,770",And who won?
11,"00:05:11,895","00:05:12,895","Oh, he did."
12,"00:05:12,980","00:05:14,648",He was always eight moves ahead.
13,"00:05:16,150","00:05:17,317",Hmm.
14,"00:05:17,443","00:05:18,443",Aldo...
15,"00:05:19,153","00:05:20,237",I'm sorry.
16,"00:05:20,362","00:05:21,362",Hmm.
17,"00:05:21,739","00:05:24,658","No, go on. What happened,
do you know?"
18,"00:05:25,200","00:05:27,494","No. They say a heart attack,
but..."
19,"00:05:28,203","00:05:29,663",there had been warnings.
20,"00:05:29,788","00:05:31,415","I don't know.
I hadn't heard that."
21,"00:05:31,540","00:05:33,709","Yeah. He didn't want anyone
to know."
22,"00:05:34,585","00:05:36,170","He was afraid that if word
got out"
23,"00:05:36,295","00:05:39,006","that they would start
circulating rumours"
24,"00:05:39,131","00:05:40,716",that he was going to resign.
25,"00:05:42,801","00:05:43,801",The Curia.
26,"00:05:44,970","00:05:46,597",Yes.
27,"00:05:48,974","00:05:49,974",Okay.
28,"00:06:00,194","00:06:02,279","I know this is hard for you,
but..."
29,"00:06:02,404","00:06:05,032","we will have to prepare
a detailed statement."
30,"00:06:07,159","00:06:09,244","Who discovered
the Holy Father's body?"
31,"00:06:11,121","00:06:12,498","I did, Your Eminence."
32,"00:06:12,623","00:06:14,291",And then what did you do?
33,"00:06:16,627","00:06:20,005","I... called the Holy Father's
doctor."
34,"00:06:20,130","00:06:21,256",Mm-hmm.
35,"00:06:21,381","00:06:22,883",But it was too late.
36,"00:06:23,008","00:06:24,008",Mm-hmm.
37,"00:06:24,343","00:06:25,886",And what time was this?
38,"00:06:27,304","00:06:30,599","Around... 11:30, Eminence."
39,"00:06:32,142","00:06:34,186","We would have called you
earlier, but..."
40,"00:06:37,856","00:06:40,400","Thomas, I'm so sorry."
41,"00:06:40,526","00:06:43,195","I know His Holiness had
no colleagues"
42,"00:06:43,320","00:06:44,988",closer than you and Aldo.
43,"00:06:45,864","00:06:48,534","But I asked Janusz to hold off
calling you."
44,"00:06:48,659","00:06:51,662","I wanted to ascertain
all the facts."
45,"00:06:52,079","00:06:54,581",You know how rumour spreads.
46,"00:06:54,706","00:06:59,711","I've prepared a timeline of
His Holiness's last day,"
47,"00:07:00,546","00:07:05,968","and these are the Holy Father''s
most recent medical records."
48,"00:07:06,093","00:07:09,096","And who was the last to have
a scheduled meeting with him?"
49,"00:07:09,221","00:07:10,639",I believe that may have been me.
50,"00:07:10,764","00:07:12,474","Father Wozniak,
I was the last one?"
51,"00:07:12,599","00:07:14,685","You were, Eminence Tremblay."
52,"00:07:15,435","00:07:17,521","Put in all the meetings he had
that day."
53,"00:07:18,605","00:07:21,733","It will show how hard he was
working right to the very end."
54,"00:07:21,859","00:07:22,859",Well...
55,"00:07:23,569","00:07:25,737","it might look like we
were placing"
56,"00:07:25,863","00:07:28,115",a huge burden on a sick man.
57,"00:07:28,532","00:07:30,242","The Papacy is a huge burden,"
58,"00:07:30,701","00:07:32,327",especially for an older man.
59,"00:07:37,374","00:07:38,834","Well, Dean,"
60,"00:07:38,959","00:07:41,128",it seems the responsibility for the Conclave
61,"00:07:41,253","00:07:42,253",falls upon you.
62,"00:08:02,566","00:08:03,942",Seal the room.
63,"00:09:41,415","00:09:43,059",Security say they'd like to test
64,"00:09:43,083","00:09:44,978","the electronic jammers
one last time, Your Eminence."
65,"00:09:45,002","00:09:46,187","Well, then they'd better
be quick."
66,"00:09:46,211","00:09:48,005","Is this really necessary, Willi?"
67,"00:09:48,797","00:09:49,965",Apparently so.
68,"00:09:50,090","00:09:51,800","They say eavesdroppers
can use lasers"
69,"00:09:51,925","00:09:53,468","to read the vibrations
of the glass."
70,"00:09:53,593","00:09:55,154","Really? Well,
let's hope none of our brothers"
71,"00:09:55,178","00:09:56,388",suffer from claustrophobia.
72,"00:09:56,513","00:09:58,640","And who knows how long
we're going to be in here?"
73,"00:09:58,765","00:10:01,268","Can you reassure me that we
will be finished on time?"
74,"00:10:01,393","00:10:03,288","They will work through
the night if they have to."
75,"00:10:03,312","00:10:05,689","It will be fine, Your Eminence.
It always is."
76,"00:10:05,814","00:10:08,275","- Italy, you know.
- I'm sorry to fuss."
77,"00:10:09,735","00:10:12,779","Well, Eminence, I'd say this is
a pretty fair vision of hell."
78,"00:10:12,904","00:10:14,323","Well, don't be blasphemous, Ray."
79,"00:10:14,448","00:10:15,574",Hell arrives tomorrow
80,"00:10:15,699","00:10:17,117",when we bring in the cardinals.
81,"00:10:18,243","00:10:19,828","Now, how do I pronounce this?"
82,"00:10:21,538","00:10:23,123","Kahl-koh, Your Eminence.
He's Indian."
83,"00:10:23,248","00:10:24,541","Oh, Kahl-koh, thank you."
84,"00:10:27,002","00:10:31,715","Archbishop Wozniak has asked if
he might have a word, Eminence."
85,"00:10:32,382","00:10:33,609","Well, I don't think that's
possible."
86,"00:10:33,633","00:10:35,273","The cardinals will be arriving
in an hour."
87,"00:10:35,385","00:10:37,220","What's it about?
- He didn't say."
88,"00:10:37,763","00:10:39,123","I... I wouldn't have
brought it up,"
89,"00:10:39,222","00:10:42,476",it's just he seemed so... upset.
90,"00:10:42,601","00:10:44,579","Ray, we're going to be
sequestered from six o'clock."
91,"00:10:44,603","00:10:45,788",He should've come to me earlier.
92,"00:10:45,812","00:10:47,292","Yes, Your Eminence.
I'll let him know."
93,"00:10:48,690","00:10:49,775","No, Ray..."
94,"00:10:49,900","00:10:51,234",tell him that I will see him
95,"00:10:51,360","00:10:52,778",after I've met the cardinals.
96,"00:10:52,903","00:10:53,903",The poor fellow will be
97,"00:10:53,987","00:10:55,572",worrying about his future.
98,"00:12:51,104","00:12:52,856","So, how many is that, Willi?"
99,"00:12:52,981","00:12:54,816","103, Eminence Lawrence."
100,"00:12:55,358","00:12:57,360","I wonder where Tedesco
has got to."
101,"00:12:57,486","00:12:58,570",Perhaps he's not coming.
102,"00:12:58,695","00:13:00,322","Well, that'd be too much
to hope for."
103,"00:13:02,991","00:13:04,385","We could wait inside,
if you prefer."
104,"00:13:04,409","00:13:06,249","No, let's stay out here
and get some fresh air"
105,"00:13:06,369","00:13:07,370",while we can.
106,"00:13:07,496","00:13:08,496",Ah.
107,"00:13:11,583","00:13:12,918",Father Bellini.
108,"00:13:14,503","00:13:15,587",Aldo.
109,"00:13:16,963","00:13:19,257","- Am I the last?
- Not quite. How are you?"
110,"00:13:19,382","00:13:21,968","Oh, well, you know,
fairly dreadful."
111,"00:13:22,469","00:13:23,905","- Have you seen the papers?
- Mm-hmm."
112,"00:13:23,929","00:13:25,615","Apparently it's already decided
it's to be me."
113,"00:13:25,639","00:13:27,265",And I happen to agree with them.
114,"00:13:27,599","00:13:29,976","What if I don't
want it?"
115,"00:13:30,435","00:13:32,020","No sane man would want
the Papacy."
116,"00:13:32,145","00:13:35,023","Some of our colleagues seem to
want it."
117,"00:13:35,148","00:13:37,943","What if I know in my heart that
I am not worthy?"
118,"00:13:38,068","00:13:39,611","You are more worthy than any
of us."
119,"00:13:39,736","00:13:41,214","- I'm not.
- Well, then tell your supporters"
120,"00:13:41,238","00:13:43,949","not to vote for you.
Pass the chalice."
121,"00:13:44,074","00:13:45,534",And let it go to him?
122,"00:13:45,867","00:13:47,494",I could never live with myself.
123,"00:13:50,413","00:13:51,873",Eminence Tedesco.
124,"00:13:53,333","00:13:54,793",Dean Lawrence!
125,"00:13:55,627","00:13:56,670",How are you?
126,"00:13:56,795","00:13:58,088","I'm well, Goffredo."
127,"00:13:59,089","00:14:01,209","Sorry, my train
was delayed from Venice."
128,"00:14:01,299","00:14:02,968","- We've missed you.
- Yes."
129,"00:14:03,093","00:14:04,135",No doubt.
130,"00:14:04,803","00:14:08,139","But don't worry,
my friends have kept me well informed."
131,"00:14:08,265","00:14:09,345",Are you well?
132,"00:14:10,392","00:14:12,269",No one is ever well at our age.
133,"00:14:12,394","00:14:13,645",True.
134,"00:14:14,354","00:14:15,689","And you, huh?"
135,"00:14:15,814","00:14:17,315","How do you feel with your new,"
136,"00:14:17,440","00:14:19,734","er, responsibility?"
137,"00:14:23,238","00:14:24,406",Everything under control?
138,"00:14:24,531","00:14:25,716","Yes, I believe so."
139,"00:14:25,740","00:14:27,117","Eminence Tedesco, may I?
- No."
140,"00:14:28,618","00:14:29,744",See you later.
141,"00:14:29,869","00:14:31,989","You're welcome.
See you later, Eminence."
142,"00:14:38,920","00:14:42,007","Tell you what, that's enormous."
143,"00:14:42,132","00:14:44,050","Apparently Pope John the 23rd
was too fat"
144,"00:14:44,175","00:14:46,055","to fit into the biggest cassock,
so they had to"
145,"00:14:46,136","00:14:47,512","split the seam
at the back"
146,"00:14:47,637","00:14:48,930",for him to get into it.
147,"00:14:51,975","00:14:53,059",No.
148,"00:14:55,645","00:14:56,938",You look tired.
149,"00:14:57,981","00:14:59,566","Well, all this is..."
150,"00:15:00,191","00:15:02,360","a duty I thought I'd never have
to perform."
151,"00:15:02,485","00:15:04,529","I thought he would outlive
all of us."
152,"00:15:07,115","00:15:09,200",We didn't part well.
153,"00:15:12,704","00:15:16,666","I asked for his permission to
resign as Dean,"
154,"00:15:17,917","00:15:19,210",join an order.
155,"00:15:20,003","00:15:21,004",What did he say?
156,"00:15:21,671","00:15:23,465",He refused my resignation.
157,"00:15:23,590","00:15:25,467","Said some were chosen to
be shepherds"
158,"00:15:25,592","00:15:28,637","and some to manage
the farm."
159,"00:15:28,762","00:15:30,597",Apparently I am a manager.
160,"00:15:33,141","00:15:35,143","He told me about your
crisis of faith."
161,"00:15:37,771","00:15:41,316","But you should know that he had
his own doubts..."
162,"00:15:41,441","00:15:43,151",towards the end.
163,"00:15:43,276","00:15:45,987","Wow, the Pope had doubts
about God?"
164,"00:15:46,112","00:15:47,112",No.
165,"00:15:47,656","00:15:50,033",Never about God.
166,"00:15:50,158","00:15:52,202","What he had lost faith in was
the church."
167,"00:15:53,703","00:15:55,205",Father Wozniak?
168,"00:15:56,706","00:15:58,208","In the name of the Father, the Son,"
169,"00:15:58,333","00:15:59,501",and the Holy Ghost.
170,"00:15:59,626","00:16:01,066","- My last confession was...
- Janusz."
171,"00:16:01,127","00:16:02,253","four weeks ago.
- Janusz,"
172,"00:16:02,379","00:16:03,379",I haven't got time
173,"00:16:03,463","00:16:04,547",to hear your confession.
174,"00:16:04,673","00:16:06,299",There's still so much to do.
175,"00:16:07,676","00:16:08,676",Have you been drinking?
176,"00:16:11,638","00:16:13,098",What's troubling you? Tell me.
177,"00:16:14,891","00:16:16,476","I should have come to you
before,"
178,"00:16:18,019","00:16:19,813","but I promised not to
say anything."
179,"00:16:19,938","00:16:20,938",Promised who?
180,"00:16:20,980","00:16:22,399",Cardinal Tremblay.
181,"00:16:22,524","00:16:24,818","Janusz, the doors close soon
and you'll have to leave."
182,"00:16:24,943","00:16:26,528","Now, if you promised
Cardinal Tremblay,"
183,"00:16:26,653","00:16:28,255","then perhaps it isn't
right that you're..."
184,"00:16:28,279","00:16:29,781","The day the Pope died,"
185,"00:16:30,156","00:16:32,742","the last person to have
an official appointment with him"
186,"00:16:32,867","00:16:34,953","was Cardinal Tremblay.
- Yes, I know,"
187,"00:16:35,078","00:16:37,205","it's on the official timeline.
- At that meeting,"
188,"00:16:37,330","00:16:38,998",the Holy Father dismissed him.
189,"00:16:41,000","00:16:42,043",What?
190,"00:16:42,168","00:16:43,586",He sacked him!
191,"00:16:46,631","00:16:47,631",Why?
192,"00:16:48,425","00:16:49,968",For gross misconduct.
193,"00:16:52,137","00:16:53,847",And you tell me this now?
194,"00:16:54,472","00:16:56,141","We're about to be sequestered,
Janusz."
195,"00:16:56,266","00:16:59,269","Forgive me, but it wasn't until
the last few days"
196,"00:16:59,394","00:17:00,854","when I started to hear
the rumours."
197,"00:17:00,979","00:17:02,021",What rumours?
198,"00:17:02,147","00:17:04,232",That he may be elected Pope.
199,"00:17:04,357","00:17:07,277","Oh, and you see it as your duty
to prevent that, do you?"
200,"00:17:07,402","00:17:10,280",I... I no longer know what my duty is.
201,"00:17:24,002","00:17:26,045",Were you there at this meeting?
202,"00:17:26,171","00:17:27,547","No, Your Eminence."
203,"00:17:27,922","00:17:30,425","The Holy Father told me about
it afterwards,"
204,"00:17:30,550","00:17:31,718",when we had supper.
205,"00:17:32,177","00:17:33,636",Did he tell you why
206,"00:17:33,762","00:17:35,472","he had dismissed
Eminence Tremblay?"
207,"00:17:35,847","00:17:37,432",Err... no.
208,"00:17:38,558","00:17:42,228","He said the reasons would
become clear soon enough."
209,"00:19:04,102","00:19:05,353",Dean Lawrence...
210,"00:19:06,271","00:19:07,271",an issue.
211,"00:19:08,273","00:19:09,482","Oh, dear God."
212,"00:19:09,983","00:19:11,693","One of them's died?
- I'm sorry?"
213,"00:19:11,818","00:19:13,194",Have we lost a cardinal?
214,"00:19:13,319","00:19:14,320","No, Your Eminence."
215,"00:19:14,445","00:19:16,197",We seem to have acquired one.
216,"00:19:16,322","00:19:17,490",I mean it literally.
217,"00:19:17,615","00:19:20,368","Another cardinal has just
turned up."
218,"00:19:20,493","00:19:22,704","Well, then, we've left someone
off the list."
219,"00:19:22,829","00:19:25,582","He was never on our list,
Eminence."
220,"00:19:25,707","00:19:27,876","He says he was created
in pectore."
221,"00:19:28,001","00:19:30,169","Oh no, then he has to be
an imposter, surely."
222,"00:19:30,295","00:19:31,772","Well, that's what I thought,
Eminence."
223,"00:19:31,796","00:19:33,673","But Archbishop Mandorff has
spoken to him"
224,"00:19:33,798","00:19:35,258",and he thinks not.
225,"00:19:37,051","00:19:38,678","Er, what's this I'm hearing?"
226,"00:19:41,139","00:19:43,349","His name is Vincent Benitez,
Your Eminence."
227,"00:19:43,766","00:19:45,518",He's the Archbishop of Kabul.
228,"00:19:45,894","00:19:47,562",Archbishop of where?
229,"00:19:47,687","00:19:48,730",Kabul.
230,"00:19:48,855","00:19:50,231",But he's Mexican.
231,"00:19:50,732","00:19:52,567","The Holy Father appointed him
last year."
232,"00:19:52,692","00:19:55,862","Last year? So, how has this
been kept a secret for so long?"
233,"00:19:55,987","00:19:58,107","I thought perhaps you would be aware of
his elevation."
234,"00:19:58,156","00:20:00,909","No, I'm not. Ray, ask
Eminence Bellini to join us,"
235,"00:20:01,034","00:20:02,577","maybe he knows something
of this."
236,"00:20:02,702","00:20:04,329","- Yes, Eminence.
- Thank you."
237,"00:20:04,454","00:20:06,748","He has a letter of appointment
from the Pope,"
238,"00:20:06,873","00:20:09,125","addressed to the
archdiocese of Kabul,"
239,"00:20:09,250","00:20:11,502","which they kept secret at
the Holy Father's request."
240,"00:20:11,628","00:20:12,628",Mm-hmm.
241,"00:20:14,213","00:20:16,215","You don't think he could've
forged it?"
242,"00:20:16,966","00:20:18,968","Well, err, where is he now?"
243,"00:20:20,970","00:20:22,972","A cardinal in
Afghanistan?"
244,"00:20:23,097","00:20:24,657","- Hmm.
- It's absurd."
245,"00:20:24,682","00:20:26,434","How many Catholics are there
in Afghanistan?"
246,"00:20:26,559","00:20:28,370","He was head of
the Catholic mission there"
247,"00:20:28,394","00:20:29,896",until his elevation.
248,"00:20:30,897","00:20:32,857","But how can we possibly ensure
his safety?"
249,"00:20:32,982","00:20:34,984","Well, presumably that's why
the Holy Father"
250,"00:20:35,109","00:20:36,486",wanted it kept a secret.
251,"00:20:36,611","00:20:39,405","Well, it won't be in
pectore now."
252,"00:20:39,530","00:20:42,325","I don't think we have any
choice but to admit him."
253,"00:20:42,450","00:20:44,452","Wait, wait. Thomas."
254,"00:20:46,913","00:20:48,289",Are we sure...
255,"00:20:48,414","00:20:50,750","that the Holy Father
was entirely..."
256,"00:20:50,875","00:20:52,502",competent...
257,"00:20:52,627","00:20:54,087",when he made this appointment?
258,"00:20:59,550","00:21:03,513","I believe this man is legally
a cardinal, Aldo, and I..."
259,"00:21:03,930","00:21:06,891","I think he has a right
to take part in the election."
260,"00:21:33,918","00:21:35,545","Eminences, before we eat,"
261,"00:21:35,670","00:21:39,173","I'd like to introduce a new
member of our order,"
262,"00:21:39,632","00:21:42,802","whose existence
was not known to any of us"
263,"00:21:42,927","00:21:45,138","erm, until only a few hours ago."
264,"00:21:45,263","00:21:47,265",This is because our brother
265,"00:21:47,640","00:21:51,728","was made a cardinal by the
perfectly legitimate procedure"
266,"00:21:51,853","00:21:54,897",known as creation in pectore.
267,"00:21:55,440","00:21:57,400","Now, the reason why it had to
be done this way"
268,"00:21:57,525","00:22:00,737","is known only to God and to
the late Holy Father."
269,"00:22:00,862","00:22:02,342","But I think we can guess well enough,"
270,"00:22:02,447","00:22:04,657",as our new brother's ministry
271,"00:22:04,782","00:22:06,951",is an extremely dangerous one.
272,"00:22:07,827","00:22:09,704","Welcome to our order,"
273,"00:22:09,829","00:22:11,664","Vincent Benitez,"
274,"00:22:11,789","00:22:14,208",Cardinal Archbishop of...
275,"00:22:14,333","00:22:15,334",Kabul.
276,"00:22:32,060","00:22:34,645","Eminence, please would you
bless our meal?"
277,"00:22:34,771","00:22:36,647",Of course.
278,"00:22:38,524","00:22:40,401","Bless us, oh Lord,"
279,"00:22:40,943","00:22:42,528","and these, your gifts,"
280,"00:22:42,653","00:22:44,614","which we are about to receive
from your bounty."
281,"00:22:44,739","00:22:45,782",Amen.
282,"00:22:47,867","00:22:49,535",Bless all those
283,"00:22:50,661","00:22:54,040","who cannot share this meal
with us"
284,"00:22:54,415","00:22:57,752","and help us, O Lord,
as we wat and drink,"
285,"00:22:57,877","00:22:59,587","to remember the hungry,"
286,"00:23:00,713","00:23:01,798","the thirsty,"
287,"00:23:02,965","00:23:04,509","the sick,"
288,"00:23:04,634","00:23:06,427","and the lonely,"
289,"00:23:06,552","00:23:09,347","and the sisters who prepared
this food for us."
290,"00:23:10,264","00:23:11,641",Through Christ Our Lord.
291,"00:23:12,600","00:23:13,601",Amen.
292,"00:23:15,561","00:23:16,604",Amen.
293,"00:23:16,729","00:23:18,606","Please, come."
294,"00:23:18,731","00:23:19,732",This is your...
295,"00:23:30,785","00:23:31,786",Dean!
296,"00:23:37,333","00:23:38,459",Goffredo.
297,"00:23:38,584","00:23:39,585",Thomas.
298,"00:23:41,129","00:23:42,129",Come.
299,"00:23:42,880","00:23:44,423",Take some wine.
300,"00:23:47,135","00:23:48,136",Thank you.
301,"00:23:52,723","00:23:53,963",You look anxious.
302,"00:23:54,058","00:23:55,058",Oh...
303,"00:23:55,810","00:23:57,603","And we haven't
even begun yet."
304,"00:24:00,565","00:24:01,834",Our new brother...
305,"00:24:01,858","00:24:03,818","Did I hear correctly, Afghanistan?"
306,"00:24:03,943","00:24:04,943",Yes.
307,"00:24:04,986","00:24:08,865","A marvellous testament to
the Universal Church,"
308,"00:24:10,408","00:24:12,827","So many men of different
cultures, races,"
309,"00:24:12,952","00:24:15,454","bound together
by their faith in God."
310,"00:24:18,040","00:24:19,040",Hmm?
311,"00:24:20,668","00:24:21,668",Look around you.
312,"00:24:23,212","00:24:25,798","Notice how everyone gravitates
to their fellow countrymen."
313,"00:24:27,008","00:24:28,342",Italians over here.
314,"00:24:28,885","00:24:29,886","Spanish speakers there,"
315,"00:24:30,011","00:24:30,845",Mm-hmm.
316,"00:24:30,970","00:24:31,804",English there.
317,"00:24:31,929","00:24:32,929",Yes.
318,"00:24:33,222","00:24:34,098",French.
319,"00:24:36,434","00:24:38,227",Divided by language.
320,"00:24:39,896","00:24:42,773","When we were boys
and the Tridentine Mass"
321,"00:24:42,899","00:24:44,859","was still the only true liturgy
of the world,"
322,"00:24:45,484","00:24:47,987","we would all have been
speaking Latin."
323,"00:24:49,447","00:24:52,283","But then your fellow liberals
insisted we get rid of that"
324,"00:24:52,408","00:24:53,659","""dead"" language."
325,"00:24:56,454","00:24:59,123","Without Rome, without
the tradition of Rome..."
326,"00:25:01,918","00:25:03,628",Things fall apart.
327,"00:25:04,712","00:25:06,297",The centre cannot hold.
328,"00:25:08,883","00:25:12,678","So what,
the next pope must be Italian?"
329,"00:25:12,803","00:25:13,803",Why not?
330,"00:25:13,846","00:25:16,726","We haven't had an Italian pope for more
than 40 years. 40 years, Tommaso."
331,"00:25:20,519","00:25:23,022","Can you seriously imagine
the alternative?"
332,"00:25:33,574","00:25:38,037","Excuse me, I must circulate
amongst our brothers."
333,"00:25:40,206","00:25:42,833",The abyss calls out.
334,"00:25:48,047","00:25:49,927",It was shrewd of him to stay away
335,"00:25:49,966","00:25:51,467",from Rome until today.
336,"00:25:52,343","00:25:54,470","One outspoken newspaper
interview"
337,"00:25:54,595","00:25:56,180",could have written Tedesco off.
338,"00:25:57,390","00:26:00,518","But instead, he will do well
tomorrow, I think."
339,"00:26:00,643","00:26:02,436",Which means?
340,"00:26:02,561","00:26:03,938",I would say...
341,"00:26:04,313","00:26:07,066","he's worth 15 votes
on the first ballet."
342,"00:26:07,191","00:26:08,567",And Bellini?
343,"00:26:12,947","00:26:16,117","Why do I feel like a
cow being priced by the farmer?"
344,"00:26:16,242","00:26:17,285",First ballot...
345,"00:26:19,287","00:26:22,164",Between 20 and 25.
346,"00:26:22,290","00:26:26,127","But it is tomorrow night that
the real work begins."
347,"00:26:26,544","00:26:31,841","Somehow we have to get him
a two thirds majority, hmm?"
348,"00:26:31,966","00:26:34,385","By real work you mean what, exactly?"
349,"00:26:34,510","00:26:37,805","But Eminence Bellini, those who seek
the Papacy..."
350,"00:26:37,930","00:26:40,891","I don't ""seek"" the Papacy. I..."
351,"00:26:53,070","00:26:54,405","Thank you, Sisters."
352,"00:26:59,952","00:27:01,805","Listen, you don't
have to do anything."
353,"00:27:01,829","00:27:03,289",Just leave it to us.
354,"00:27:03,414","00:27:06,292","Tell them I stand for a
common-sense approach"
355,"00:27:06,625","00:27:10,421","to such issues as gays
and divorce."
356,"00:27:11,005","00:27:14,008","Tell them I stand for never
returning to the days"
357,"00:27:14,133","00:27:15,926","of the Latin liturgy,"
358,"00:27:16,677","00:27:18,137",or families of ten children
359,"00:27:18,262","00:27:20,431","because Mama and Papa
didn't know any better."
360,"00:27:20,556","00:27:22,683","That was an ugly
and repressive time"
361,"00:27:22,808","00:27:24,185",and I'm glad that it's over.
362,"00:27:24,685","00:27:26,354",Tell them I stand for...
363,"00:27:26,479","00:27:27,980","respecting other faiths,"
364,"00:27:28,773","00:27:31,942","for tolerating other views
within our own church."
365,"00:27:33,194","00:27:35,404",And tell them that I believe
366,"00:27:35,529","00:27:38,032","women should play more of
a role in the Curia."
367,"00:27:38,157","00:27:39,200","Let's, um..."
368,"00:27:39,575","00:27:41,202",Let's not mention women.
369,"00:27:41,327","00:27:42,327",Why?
370,"00:27:43,079","00:27:46,165","Brother, I have no intention of
concealing my views"
371,"00:27:46,290","00:27:48,209","or pretending to be anything
other than I am"
372,"00:27:48,334","00:27:50,836","in order to sway any of our
number who are undecided."
373,"00:27:50,961","00:27:51,961",So...
374,"00:27:52,671","00:27:55,841","if you want to canvas
on my behalf,"
375,"00:27:55,966","00:27:58,052","then make sure that
my message is clear."
376,"00:27:58,719","00:28:02,765","I stand for everything that
Tedesco does not."
377,"00:28:06,602","00:28:08,312","- Okay.
- If you'll excuse me."
378,"00:28:12,942","00:28:14,193",Alright.
379,"00:28:14,318","00:28:17,029","Rocco, you talk to the Americans."
380,"00:28:17,154","00:28:19,281","Villanueva, I'll leave
the South Americans to you."
381,"00:28:19,824","00:28:22,326","Gianmarco,
you take the Africans."
382,"00:28:22,451","00:28:23,994",Aldo doesn't want it.
383,"00:28:25,287","00:28:26,287",Any of it.
384,"00:28:27,540","00:28:28,958","You know that, don't you?"
385,"00:28:29,375","00:28:30,418","Of course, I do."
386,"00:28:30,543","00:28:31,794",That's why I support him.
387,"00:28:32,253","00:28:33,838",The men who are dangerous
388,"00:28:33,963","00:28:35,840",are the ones who do want it.
389,"00:28:44,557","00:28:47,601","I'm enjoying all this mystery,
Thomas."
390,"00:28:49,395","00:28:53,190","And I suppose you should tell
me what you want to talk about."
391,"00:28:56,485","00:28:58,487","Your last meeting with
the Holy Father."
392,"00:28:59,572","00:29:00,614","Oh, what about it?"
393,"00:29:01,490","00:29:03,409","Well, I've been told
it was difficult."
394,"00:29:04,994","00:29:07,955","- Was it?
- Difficult? No."
395,"00:29:08,080","00:29:09,665",Not that I can recall.
396,"00:29:10,499","00:29:12,394","Well, I... I'm sorry to have to
ask you this, Joe,"
397,"00:29:12,418","00:29:13,419","but to be specific,"
398,"00:29:13,544","00:29:15,254",I was told that the Holy Father
399,"00:29:15,379","00:29:16,755",demanded your resignation.
400,"00:29:18,132","00:29:19,132",What?
401,"00:29:20,468","00:29:21,927","- That's absurd.
- I..."
402,"00:29:22,761","00:29:25,014","I don't know what we...
who... who told you that?"
403,"00:29:25,139","00:29:26,139",Archbishop Wozniak.
404,"00:29:26,223","00:29:27,766",Why would he say such a thing?
405,"00:29:27,892","00:29:30,811","So, there isn't any truth in the allegation?"
406,"00:29:30,936","00:29:33,522","Oh God, no, of course not. It's absurd."
407,"00:29:33,647","00:29:34,647",Hmm.
408,"00:29:35,274","00:29:37,985","- You don't think that...
- No, well, I... I had to ask."
409,"00:29:38,110","00:29:39,945","I understand, but no."
410,"00:29:40,070","00:29:42,448","You... you can ask
Monsignor Morales."
411,"00:29:42,573","00:29:43,824",He was at the meeting.
412,"00:29:43,949","00:29:44,742","Well, I would,"
413,"00:29:44,867","00:29:45,868",but at the moment
414,"00:29:45,993","00:29:47,786",we happen to be sequestered.
415,"00:29:47,912","00:29:48,912",Oh.
416,"00:29:54,585","00:29:57,046","Can you think of any reason why
Archbishop Wozniak"
417,"00:29:57,171","00:29:58,714",would circulate such a story?
418,"00:29:58,839","00:30:00,883","No, I can't."
419,"00:30:01,008","00:30:03,677",I really... do you want a coffee?
420,"00:30:03,802","00:30:04,802",No.
421,"00:30:06,597","00:30:07,765",I'm shocked.
422,"00:30:08,974","00:30:10,142",He told you this himself?
423,"00:30:10,267","00:30:11,267",Yeah.
424,"00:30:17,233","00:30:18,233",You don't think...?
425,"00:30:19,944","00:30:20,944","Well, what?"
426,"00:30:22,071","00:30:23,197",The drinking?
427,"00:30:23,322","00:30:25,407","I don't like to bring it up,
but we both know"
428,"00:30:25,533","00:30:28,577","his drinking has been getting
much heavier."
429,"00:30:29,411","00:30:33,457","And perhaps it's affecting his
judgement, hi-his mind even."
430,"00:30:35,042","00:30:36,210",And...
431,"00:30:36,544","00:30:40,548","I know my name has
been mentioned as a future Pope."
432,"00:30:40,673","00:30:43,676","And if the Archbishop doesn't
approve of that idea,"
433,"00:30:43,801","00:30:45,135",maybe he's...
434,"00:30:47,096","00:30:49,682","I don't know, I... I'm just
trying to make sense of this."
435,"00:30:51,475","00:30:52,893",And the poor man.
436,"00:30:53,561","00:30:55,896","He was shattered by
the Holy Father's death."
437,"00:30:56,647","00:30:57,690","Yes, indeed."
438,"00:30:57,815","00:30:59,858","Again, Joe, er, my apologies."
439,"00:30:59,984","00:31:01,360","No, not at all."
440,"00:31:02,695","00:31:04,530",I completely understand.
441,"00:31:06,490","00:31:07,490",Erm...
442,"00:31:08,242","00:31:10,953","what did you discuss with
the Holy Father"
443,"00:31:11,078","00:31:12,621","in that final
meeting?"
444,"00:31:12,746","00:31:14,123","Forgive me, Thomas."
445,"00:31:15,291","00:31:17,418","It was a private conversation,"
446,"00:31:17,543","00:31:19,044",and very precious.
447,"00:31:19,587","00:31:21,630","Those were the last words
I ever exchanged"
448,"00:31:21,755","00:31:23,173",with the Holy Father.
449,"00:31:24,592","00:31:25,634","Yes, of course."
450,"00:31:27,553","00:31:28,596","Goodnight, Joe."
451,"00:31:29,638","00:31:30,806",Goodnight Thomas.
452,"00:31:44,445","00:31:45,696","- Decano.
- Ah!"
453,"00:31:47,948","00:31:49,742","Oh, we're neighbours, Joshua."
454,"00:31:50,284","00:31:52,244","Ah, it appears so."
455,"00:31:52,369","00:31:54,747","I thought that I should, er..."
456,"00:31:54,872","00:31:57,583","do a little more work on
my homily for tomorrow."
457,"00:31:57,708","00:32:00,127","Ah, yes, of course. I look forward to it."
458,"00:32:01,378","00:32:02,421",I understand the trick
459,"00:32:02,546","00:32:04,256",is to offend no one.
460,"00:33:04,858","00:33:06,402",You're a manager.
461,"00:33:08,612","00:33:09,822",Manage.
462,"00:33:23,961","00:33:25,295",Decano Lawrence?
463,"00:35:01,767","00:35:03,977","Dear Brothers in Christ,"
464,"00:35:05,562","00:35:08,315","at the moment of great
uncertainty,"
465,"00:35:08,440","00:35:10,484","in the history of
the Holy Church,"
466,"00:35:10,818","00:35:15,030","we must think first of
the late Holy Father,"
467,"00:35:15,781","00:35:20,118","whose brilliant pontificate
was a gift from God,"
468,"00:35:20,786","00:35:26,166","now we must ask our Lord to
send us a new Holy Father,"
469,"00:35:26,542","00:35:31,380","through the pastoral solicitude
of the cardinal fathers."
470,"00:35:32,548","00:35:37,177","And we must pray to God for
that loving assistance,"
471,"00:35:37,719","00:35:39,805",and ask Him to guide us
472,"00:35:40,722","00:35:44,017",to the right choice.
473,"00:35:50,482","00:35:52,109",But you know all that.
474,"00:35:54,278","00:35:56,780","Let me speak from the heart for
a moment."
475,"00:35:58,657","00:36:01,410","St Paul said, 'Be subject to
one another"
476,"00:36:01,535","00:36:03,745",out of reverence for Christ.'
477,"00:36:04,830","00:36:06,582","To work together, and to, er..."
478,"00:36:06,707","00:36:10,127","to grow together,
we must be tolerant."
479,"00:36:11,128","00:36:15,007","No one person or... or faction
seeking to dominate another."
480,"00:36:16,300","00:36:18,051","And speaking to the Ephesians,"
481,"00:36:18,176","00:36:21,513","who were of course a mixture of
Jews and gentiles,"
482,"00:36:22,014","00:36:25,809","Paul reminds us that God's gift
to the church..."
483,"00:36:26,935","00:36:28,770",is its variety.
484,"00:36:28,896","00:36:32,774","It is this variety, this diversity of
people and views"
485,"00:36:32,900","00:36:36,403","which gives our church
its strength."
486,"00:36:36,528","00:36:37,808","And over the course of
many years"
487,"00:36:37,905","00:36:39,573","in the service of our
Mother the Church,"
488,"00:36:39,698","00:36:42,159","let me tell you, there is
one sin,"
489,"00:36:42,284","00:36:45,120","which I have come to
fear above all others."
490,"00:36:47,080","00:36:48,373",Certainty.
491,"00:36:51,543","00:36:54,087",Certainty is the great enemy of unity.
492,"00:36:56,757","00:37:00,135","Certainty is the deadly enemy
of tolerance."
493,"00:37:02,804","00:37:05,265","Even Christ was not certain
at the end."
494,"00:37:05,390","00:37:08,143","My God, My God, why are you
forsaken me?"
495,"00:37:08,268","00:37:12,314","He cried out in his agony at the
ninth hour on the cross."
496,"00:37:13,357","00:37:15,484","Our faith is a living thing,"
497,"00:37:15,609","00:37:19,321","precisely because it walks
hand-in-hand with doubt."
498,"00:37:21,073","00:37:22,658",If there was only certainty...
499,"00:37:23,367","00:37:24,409",and no doubt...
500,"00:37:25,535","00:37:27,454",there would be no mystery...
501,"00:37:28,914","00:37:31,750","and therefore no need...
for faith."
502,"00:37:34,795","00:37:39,675","Let us pray that God will grant
us a Pope who doubts."
503,"00:37:39,800","00:37:44,096","And let him grant us a Pope who
sins and asks for forgiveness,"
504,"00:37:45,180","00:37:46,556",and who carries on.
505,"00:38:46,575","00:38:47,784",Dean Lawrence...
506,"00:38:48,201","00:38:51,496","your homily has
caused quite the stir."
507,"00:38:51,621","00:38:53,290","I don't think anyone expected
you to..."
508,"00:38:53,415","00:38:55,000",To say something interesting?
509,"00:38:58,378","00:39:00,589","I'll have a transcript made of
the recording."
510,"00:39:00,714","00:39:01,714",Mm-hmm.
511,"00:39:03,050","00:39:06,219","If, erm, if there's nothing
else..."
512,"00:39:09,514","00:39:10,849",Eminence.
513,"00:39:10,974","00:39:12,267","Yes, erm..."
514,"00:39:14,102","00:39:16,229","I... I need you to do
something for me."
515,"00:39:16,354","00:39:18,148",Monsignor Morales...
516,"00:39:18,273","00:39:19,941",I'm sure he's still in Rome.
517,"00:39:20,942","00:39:22,069",Could you try and see him?
518,"00:39:22,194","00:39:24,404","- Today? I... I...
- Use my authority."
519,"00:39:24,529","00:39:26,114",I'd like to know what happened
520,"00:39:26,239","00:39:28,283","in the final meeting between
Cardinal Tremblay"
521,"00:39:28,408","00:39:29,659",and the Holy Father.
522,"00:39:30,952","00:39:32,037",What happened?
523,"00:39:32,162","00:39:33,955","Specifically, did anything
occur that might"
524,"00:39:34,081","00:39:37,167","render Tremblay unfit for
the Papacy?"
525,"00:39:42,255","00:39:43,548","Of course, Your Eminence."
526,"00:39:44,549","00:39:45,549",Bless you.
527,"00:40:22,838","00:40:26,424","And I,
Irumbus Cardinal Nakitanda,"
528,"00:40:27,259","00:40:32,055","I promise, I vow and I swear
so God will help me"
529,"00:40:32,514","00:40:37,102","and these Holy Gospels of God,
which I touch with my hand."
530,"00:40:56,538","00:40:58,415","Out, everyone."

532,"00:42:18,203","00:42:21,206","we will now proceed to
the first ballot."
533,"00:42:21,873","00:42:25,627","You will find in front of you
your ballot paper."
534,"00:42:26,169","00:42:30,674","On the top half is written,
""I elect as Supreme Pontiff."""

who will be my judge"

the one who, before God,"
538,"00:43:14,843","00:43:17,262",I think should be elected.

581,"00:47:13,289","00:47:17,585","Then Baghdad, and finally,
a mission in Kabul."
582,"00:47:17,710","00:47:19,170",Right.
583,"00:47:19,295","00:47:20,895",There was some question of his resigning
584,"00:47:20,922","00:47:22,006","on health grounds,"
585,"00:47:22,131","00:47:23,331",but apparently the Holy Father
586,"00:47:23,424","00:47:24,676",convinced him to continue.
587,"00:47:24,801","00:47:26,121","He's certainly served his
ministry"
588,"00:47:26,219","00:47:27,428",in some terrible places.
589,"00:47:27,554","00:47:29,389","- Yes.
- Health grounds."
590,"00:47:29,806","00:47:31,099","Look into that, would you, Ray?"
591,"00:47:31,224","00:47:32,600",It's the kind of thing
592,"00:47:32,725","00:47:34,018",the press like to get hold of.
593,"00:47:34,143","00:47:35,270",Of course.
594,"00:47:35,979","00:47:39,107","And the, erm... other matter.
The..."
595,"00:47:40,525","00:47:42,569",Yes.
596,"00:47:42,694","00:47:46,364",I spoke to Monsignor Morales.
597,"00:47:46,489","00:47:48,783","He was emphatic that he knows
of no reason why"
598,"00:47:48,908","00:47:51,661","Cardinal Tremblay should not
be Pope."
599,"00:47:53,788","00:47:55,164","- Thank you.
- However..."
600,"00:47:55,540","00:47:56,958",will you forgive me if I say...
601,"00:47:57,667","00:48:00,295",I did not entirely believe...
602,"00:48:00,420","00:48:01,754",the good monsignor?
603,"00:48:01,879","00:48:02,922",He was just...
604,"00:48:03,715","00:48:07,051",so... emphatic.
605,"00:48:07,176","00:48:08,595",My Spanish is quite poor
606,"00:48:08,720","00:48:12,015","and I may have accidentally
given him the impression"
607,"00:48:12,140","00:48:14,642","that you had seen a document
that contradicts that."
608,"00:48:14,767","00:48:17,520","And he said you weren't
to worry,"
609,"00:48:17,645","00:48:20,064","that... and his exact words were,"
610,"00:48:20,189","00:48:22,150",'El informe ha sido retirado.'
611,"00:48:22,275","00:48:24,527",A report? A report about what?
612,"00:48:25,278","00:48:26,529",Withdrawn when?
613,"00:48:26,654","00:48:28,740","That... I couldn't say, Eminence."
614,"00:48:30,867","00:48:31,867",Hmm.
615,"00:48:44,130","00:48:45,381",Third place.
616,"00:48:45,965","00:48:47,634",Not what we had hoped.
617,"00:48:48,384","00:48:50,887","Your sermon didn't exactly
help us and you have five votes."
618,"00:48:51,304","00:48:53,014","You have far too little support
to emerge"
619,"00:48:53,139","00:48:54,307",as a serious candidate.
620,"00:48:54,432","00:48:56,118","Well, my position is an
embarrassment to me."
621,"00:48:56,142","00:48:57,894","If I find out who my
supporters are,"
622,"00:48:58,019","00:48:59,937","I'll plead with them to
vote for someone else."
623,"00:49:00,521","00:49:02,482","I'll tell them I'll be voting
for Aldo."
624,"00:49:02,607","00:49:03,607",Alright.
625,"00:49:04,817","00:49:07,111","That leaves 31 votes
available."
626,"00:49:07,236","00:49:08,946","We simply have to pick up most
of them."
627,"00:49:41,938","00:49:43,564",The Holy Father's turtles.
628,"00:49:43,981","00:49:45,483",He was very fond of them.
629,"00:49:45,608","00:49:47,652",A gift from Angola.
630,"00:49:47,777","00:49:49,320",I thought I was imagining them.
631,"00:49:49,445","00:49:51,364",I love them. They're so clever.
632,"00:49:51,489","00:49:55,284","Well, here they keep escaping
and being run over."
633,"00:49:55,410","00:49:57,704","We should go back,
the evening curfew."
634,"00:50:01,374","00:50:03,584","And your health, how are you
bearing up?"
635,"00:50:04,293","00:50:05,586","My health is perfect, thank you."
636,"00:50:05,712","00:50:08,506","I only meant have you recovered
from your journey?"
637,"00:50:08,631","00:50:10,133","- I have, indeed.
- Good."
638,"00:50:10,800","00:50:13,928","And in the Sistine, you found
someone to vote for?"
639,"00:50:14,554","00:50:16,389",Yes. I voted for you.
640,"00:50:18,141","00:50:19,726","Forgive me, am I not
supposed to say?"
641,"00:50:19,851","00:50:21,602","No, no, it's not that you..."
642,"00:50:21,936","00:50:24,397","No, I'm honoured, but...
my dear Vincent,"
643,"00:50:24,522","00:50:25,940",may I call you Vincent?
644,"00:50:26,733","00:50:28,484",I'm not a serious candidate.
645,"00:50:29,444","00:50:31,612","My vocation lies in
a different... um..."
646,"00:50:34,699","00:50:37,702","After the Conclave, I hope to
resign as Dean,"
647,"00:50:37,827","00:50:39,912",and then leave Rome altogether.
648,"00:50:40,037","00:50:41,037",Why?
649,"00:50:46,669","00:50:48,588","I've been experiencing
difficulties."
650,"00:50:49,922","00:50:50,922",With your faith?
651,"00:50:55,636","00:50:56,636",Prayer.
652,"00:50:59,891","00:51:01,517","I only mention it to illustrate
my point"
653,"00:51:01,893","00:51:04,187","that I'm in no way
worthy to be Pope."
654,"00:51:06,647","00:51:07,647",Come.
655,"00:51:19,744","00:51:20,828",Aldo.
656,"00:51:24,457","00:51:25,457",Aldo.
657,"00:51:28,377","00:51:32,173","I... I feel wretched that my
...my meagre tally of votes"
658,"00:51:32,298","00:51:34,217",may have come at your expense.
659,"00:51:35,551","00:51:36,594",Hmm.
660,"00:51:37,303","00:51:40,473","I had no idea you were
so ambitious."
661,"00:51:40,598","00:51:42,517","Well, that's a ridiculous thing
to say."
662,"00:51:43,309","00:51:44,309",Is it?
663,"00:51:45,937","00:51:46,937",Is it?
664,"00:51:48,064","00:51:49,482",I thought we had your support.
665,"00:51:50,316","00:51:53,861","If we liberals are not united,
Tedesco will become Pope."
666,"00:51:54,529","00:51:56,489","You have no idea how bad it
became, Thomas."
667,"00:51:56,614","00:51:58,574","The way he and his circle
attacked the Holy Father"
668,"00:51:58,616","00:51:59,492",towards the end.
669,"00:51:59,617","00:52:00,409","The smears,"
670,"00:52:00,535","00:52:01,661",the leaks to the press.
671,"00:52:01,786","00:52:03,246",It was savage.
672,"00:52:03,371","00:52:06,791","He fought him every single day
of his pontificate."
673,"00:52:07,375","00:52:08,375","And now that he's dead,"
674,"00:52:08,459","00:52:09,627",he wants to destroy
675,"00:52:09,752","00:52:10,878",his life's work.
676,"00:52:12,046","00:52:13,798","If Tedesco becomes Pope,"
677,"00:52:14,382","00:52:17,510","he will undo 60 years
of progress."
678,"00:52:17,635","00:52:19,315","You talk as if you're
the only alternative,"
679,"00:52:19,554","00:52:21,931","but Adeyemi has
the wind behind him."
680,"00:52:22,056","00:52:23,224","- Adeyemi?
- Mm-hmm."
681,"00:52:23,349","00:52:25,149","Adeyemi, the man who believes
that homosexuals"
682,"00:52:25,268","00:52:26,788","should be sent to prison
in this world,"
683,"00:52:26,853","00:52:28,104",and hell in the next.
684,"00:52:28,771","00:52:30,731","Adeyemi's not the answer
to anything."
685,"00:52:30,857","00:52:31,857",And you know it.
686,"00:52:32,483","00:52:33,763",If you want to defeat Tedesco...
687,"00:52:33,818","00:52:35,987","Defeat? This is a Conclave,
Aldo,"
688,"00:52:36,112","00:52:38,531","it's not a war.
- It is a war!"
689,"00:52:39,115","00:52:42,118","And you have to commit
to a side."
690,"00:52:47,582","00:52:49,625","Save your precious doubts for
your prayers."
691,"00:52:52,587","00:52:54,005",You can't seriously believe
692,"00:52:54,130","00:52:57,216","that I have the slightest
desire to become Pope."
693,"00:52:57,341","00:52:58,342",Come on!
694,"00:52:59,051","00:53:00,761",Every cardinal has that desire.
695,"00:53:01,137","00:53:03,014","Every cardinal deep down has
already chosen"
696,"00:53:03,139","00:53:05,391","the name by which he would like
his Papacy to be known."
697,"00:53:05,516","00:53:07,393",Well... I haven't.
698,"00:53:07,894","00:53:09,770","Deny it if you like,"
699,"00:53:10,563","00:53:13,441","but search your heart and then
tell me it isn't so."
700,"00:54:05,326","00:54:07,286","Oh, oh, Mother, an evil..."
701,"00:55:16,063","00:55:20,026","The results
of the second ballot are..."
702,"00:55:20,526","00:55:24,030","Cardinal Adeyemi,
34 votes."
703,"00:55:25,531","00:55:28,242","Cardinal Tedesco,
25 votes."
704,"00:55:30,244","00:55:33,080","Cardinal Bellini,
18 votes."

the Apostolic Constitution,"
709,"00:55:59,190","00:56:03,110","we proceed immediately
to the next vote."
710,"00:56:03,235","00:56:04,236",Thank you.
711,"00:56:12,286","00:56:15,998","The results of
the third ballot are..."
712,"00:56:16,457","00:56:20,211","Cardinal Adeyemi,
52 votes."

716,"00:56:43,692","00:56:44,692",Brothers.
717,"00:56:45,277","00:56:46,277",Please.
718,"00:56:47,530","00:56:48,530",Thank you.
719,"00:56:51,033","00:56:53,911","Cardinal Bellini, 9 votes."

722,"00:57:19,979","00:57:21,998","Well, I take it
something has happened."
723,"00:57:22,022","00:57:23,583","There's been an explosion, Your Eminence,"
724,"00:57:23,607","00:57:24,942",in the Piazza Barberini.
725,"00:57:25,067","00:57:27,611","- A bomb?
- It's unclear at the moment."
726,"00:57:27,736","00:57:30,281","There are injuries, but no talk
of fatalities."
727,"00:57:31,574","00:57:32,950","We must say nothing to
the cardinal"
728,"00:57:33,075","00:57:34,201","electors about this, Ray."
729,"00:57:34,326","00:57:35,536","We are sequestered,"
730,"00:57:35,870","00:57:37,788","and they must be shielded
from all news"
731,"00:57:37,913","00:57:39,498","that may influence
their judgement."
732,"00:57:40,166","00:57:42,126","- You understand?
- Of course, Your Eminence."
733,"00:57:54,430","00:57:55,723",This is exactly what I mean.
734,"00:57:55,848","00:57:57,516",What am I supposed to tell them in Milan
735,"00:57:58,017","00:58:01,854","when they start to discover our
new Pope's social views?"
736,"00:58:02,646","00:58:04,982","Tell your congregation that
they should celebrate"
737,"00:58:05,107","00:58:08,527","the first African Pope in
the history of the church."
738,"00:58:09,403","00:58:11,405","If Adeyemi was white,"
739,"00:58:12,114","00:58:13,532",we would be all condemning him
740,"00:58:13,657","00:58:15,534","as more reactionary
than Tedesco?"
741,"00:58:15,659","00:58:16,845","It's only because he's
not white..."
742,"00:58:16,869","00:58:18,662",It's too late for all that.
743,"00:58:18,787","00:58:19,580",It's too late.
744,"00:58:28,631","00:58:29,757",What happened?
745,"00:58:49,068","00:58:51,153","Good afternoon, Sister."
746,"00:58:51,278","00:58:54,240","I would like to speak to the nun
who dropped her tray just now."
747,"00:58:54,365","00:58:56,343","She's safe with me, I'm dealing
with the situation, Dean."
748,"00:58:56,367","00:58:59,787","I'm sure you are, Sister Agnes,
but I must see her myself."
749,"00:58:59,912","00:59:01,914",I hardly think a dropped tray should concern
750,"00:59:02,039","00:59:04,083","the Dean of the College
of Cardinals."
751,"00:59:04,208","00:59:05,209","Even so, I..."
752,"00:59:05,334","00:59:06,502",The welfare of the sister
753,"00:59:06,627","00:59:07,836",is my responsibility.
754,"00:59:07,962","00:59:10,005",And this Conclave is mine.
755,"00:59:21,475","00:59:23,352","Please sit, my child."
756,"00:59:26,438","00:59:28,983",My name is Cardinal Lawrence.
757,"00:59:29,108","00:59:30,150",How are you feeling?
758,"00:59:30,276","00:59:31,402",She's feeling much better.
759,"00:59:31,527","00:59:33,028",Could you tell me your name?
760,"00:59:33,445","00:59:35,239","Shanumi, her name is Shanumi."
761,"00:59:35,364","00:59:37,283","Please, please do sit down."
762,"00:59:37,408","00:59:38,760","I... I really think it would
be better"
763,"00:59:38,784","00:59:40,327","if you let me deal with
the situation."
764,"00:59:40,452","00:59:43,247","Would you be so good as to
leave us now, Sister Agnes?"
765,"01:00:06,186","01:00:07,563","Sister Shanumi,"
766,"01:00:09,023","01:00:10,858","I want you to understand that,
first of all,"
767,"01:00:10,983","01:00:13,569","you are not in any
kind of trouble."
768,"01:00:13,694","01:00:15,404",The fact of the matter is that I have
769,"01:00:15,529","01:00:17,156",a responsibility before God
770,"01:00:17,281","01:00:20,159","to ensure that the decisions
that we make here"
771,"01:00:20,743","01:00:22,119",are the right ones.
772,"01:00:23,579","01:00:26,999","Now, it's important you tell me
anything that is in your heart"
773,"01:00:27,124","01:00:28,417","or that is troubling you,"
774,"01:00:28,542","01:00:32,129","insofar as it relates to
Cardinal Adeyemi."
775,"01:00:34,840","01:00:36,050",Can you do that for me?
776,"01:00:40,721","01:00:42,431",Even if I give you my assurance
777,"01:00:42,556","01:00:44,850","it will go no further than
this room."
778,"01:00:58,280","01:01:01,033","Would you like me to hear your
confession?"
779,"01:01:12,586","01:01:13,962","I'll be ready in a moment, Dean."
780,"01:01:43,826","01:01:44,618",Shouldn't we be going?
781,"01:01:44,743","01:01:46,120",In a moment.
782,"01:01:46,245","01:01:47,287",That sounds ominous.
783,"01:01:53,085","01:01:54,685","If this is about the incident
downstairs,"
784,"01:01:54,753","01:01:56,296","I have no desire to
talk about it."
785,"01:02:00,592","01:02:02,678","I am the victim of
a disgraceful plot"
786,"01:02:02,803","01:02:04,346",to ruin my reputation.
787,"01:02:04,721","01:02:08,225","Someone brought that woman here
and staged this melodrama."
788,"01:02:08,559","01:02:09,893","She'd never left Nigeria
before,"
789,"01:02:10,018","01:02:12,396","and suddenly she's here
in the Casa Santa Marta."
790,"01:02:12,521","01:02:14,398","With respect, Joshua,
ow she came here"
791,"01:02:14,523","01:02:15,858",is secondary to the issue
792,"01:02:15,983","01:02:17,609",of your relationship with her.
793,"01:02:17,734","01:02:20,404",I have no relationship to her!
794,"01:02:22,239","01:02:23,991","I hadn't set eyes on her
in 30 years"
795,"01:02:24,116","01:02:26,076","until she turned up
outside my room last night!"
796,"01:02:32,458","01:02:33,917","It was a lapse, Dean."
797,"01:02:35,794","01:02:36,794",A lapse.
798,"01:02:38,881","01:02:42,342","'Let God grant us a Pope who
sins and asks forgiveness"
799,"01:02:42,468","01:02:43,552",and carries on.'
800,"01:02:43,677","01:02:45,220","- Your words.
- And the child?"
801,"01:02:46,138","01:02:47,138",The child?
802,"01:02:56,607","01:02:58,942","The child was raised in
a Christian household,"
803,"01:02:59,067","01:03:01,278","and to this day he has no idea
who his father is,"
804,"01:03:01,403","01:03:02,821","if, indeed, it is me."
805,"01:03:04,114","01:03:05,365",That is the child.
806,"01:03:07,576","01:03:09,286",We were very young.
807,"01:03:09,411","01:03:11,079","No, no, no, Joshua,"
808,"01:03:11,205","01:03:14,374","she was very young,
she was 19 years old."
809,"01:03:14,500","01:03:15,959","You were 30.
- Thomas."
810,"01:03:16,919","01:03:17,919",Thomas.
811,"01:03:18,420","01:03:20,297",Listen to me... please.
812,"01:03:23,175","01:03:25,302","I sensed the presence of
the Holy Spirit this morning,"
813,"01:03:25,427","01:03:26,427",I swear it.
814,"01:03:28,180","01:03:29,890",I am ready to take this burden.
815,"01:03:31,558","01:03:34,394","Do... does a single...
single mistake 30 years ago"
816,"01:03:34,520","01:03:35,729",disqualify me?
817,"01:03:37,981","01:03:39,775","Thomas, please, I was
a different man."
818,"01:03:42,361","01:03:44,738","Please, I... I beg you, do... do
not use this to ruin me."
819,"01:03:44,863","01:03:46,865","Joshua, that thought's not
worthy of you."
820,"01:03:46,990","01:03:49,660","Shanumi will say nothing to
protect her son,"
821,"01:03:50,285","01:03:52,704","and I am bound
by the vows of the confessional."
822,"01:03:56,250","01:03:57,251","So, I still have hope?"
823,"01:03:58,085","01:03:59,085",No.
824,"01:04:03,215","01:04:04,925",There is no hope.
825,"01:04:06,134","01:04:08,029","After such a public scene,
there will be rumours,"
826,"01:04:08,053","01:04:10,264","and you know
what the Curia is like."
827,"01:04:10,389","01:04:11,974",Nothing terrifies our colleagues more
828,"01:04:12,099","01:04:16,186","than the thought of yet more...
sexual scandals."
829,"01:04:18,313","01:04:20,482",I am more sorry than I can say.
830,"01:04:22,734","01:04:24,027",You will never be Pope.
831,"01:04:29,283","01:04:30,701",You must begin again.
832,"01:04:33,579","01:04:35,998",But you are a good man.
833,"01:04:38,250","01:04:40,085","I know you to be a good man,"
834,"01:04:40,419","01:04:42,504","and you will find a way
to atone."
835,"01:05:03,609","01:05:06,153",Will you pray with me?
836,"01:05:08,614","01:05:09,906","Yes, of course."
837,"01:06:28,068","01:06:31,613","The results of
the fifth ballot are..."
838,"01:06:33,073","01:06:35,909","Cardinal Tremblay, 40 votes."
839,"01:06:37,327","01:06:40,163","Cardinal Tedesco,
34 votes."
840,"01:06:41,873","01:06:44,668","Cardinal Bellini,
13 votes."
841,"01:06:46,628","01:06:49,297","Cardinal Lawrence, 11 votes."
842,"01:06:51,216","01:06:54,136","Cardinal Adeyemi, 9 votes."
843,"01:06:55,345","01:06:58,265","Cardinal Benitez, 6 votes."
844,"01:07:01,184","01:07:02,269",My brothers...
845,"01:07:03,311","01:07:05,731","My brothers, that concludes
the fifth ballot."
846,"01:07:06,690","01:07:09,985","No candidate having achieved
the necessary majority,"
847,"01:07:10,610","01:07:13,280","we shall resume voting
tomorrow morning."
848,"01:07:28,587","01:07:29,587","Yes, Ray?"
849,"01:07:30,255","01:07:32,966","The... incident this morning,
Your Eminence."
850,"01:07:33,091","01:07:34,843","I have more information, if..."
851,"01:07:34,968","01:07:37,471","No, I too must be shielded from
any knowledge"
852,"01:07:37,596","01:07:39,598","which could act as
an interference"
853,"01:07:39,723","01:07:41,433",in the process of this Conclave.
854,"01:07:41,558","01:07:42,809","Of course, Your Eminence."
855,"01:07:43,852","01:07:44,852",Anything else?
856,"01:07:44,895","01:07:45,896",Erm...
857,"01:07:46,313","01:07:49,399","Oh, Cardinal Benitez...
who has health problems?"
858,"01:07:49,775","01:07:51,985","He was issued a round-trip
ticket to Geneva"
859,"01:07:52,110","01:07:55,655","paid for by
the Pope's own account."
860,"01:07:55,781","01:07:57,783","I checked his visa application,"
861,"01:07:57,908","01:08:01,203","the purpose for travel was
given as 'medical treatment'."
862,"01:08:01,328","01:08:05,040","Anyway, whatever it was,
it can't have been serious."
863,"01:08:05,165","01:08:06,725","The ticket was cancelled,
he never went."
864,"01:08:06,792","01:08:08,418",Alright. Thank you.
865,"01:08:16,551","01:08:18,011","Forgive me, Your Eminence."
866,"01:08:19,262","01:08:22,390","I know you said we should
forget about the matter"
867,"01:08:22,516","01:08:24,976",of the withdrawn report.
868,"01:08:25,101","01:08:26,770",But I... I wondered...
869,"01:08:27,354","01:08:31,358","in light of Cardinal Tremblay's
current position..."
870,"01:08:32,818","01:08:35,070","I... I could see if I could
find out..."
871,"01:08:35,195","01:08:36,780","No, I'm not a witch-finder."
872,"01:08:37,155","01:08:38,907","It's not my job to go hunting
for secrets"
873,"01:08:39,032","01:08:40,367",in my colleagues' pasts.
874,"01:08:46,206","01:08:47,206",Forgive me.
875,"01:08:49,000","01:08:51,169","Please, no more investigations,
I..."
876,"01:08:53,129","01:08:54,673","I think we've heard enough
secrets."
877,"01:09:00,136","01:09:01,638",Let God's will be done.
878,"01:09:02,973","01:09:04,057","Yes, of course."
879,"01:09:04,641","01:09:05,934","Goodnight then, Your Eminence."
880,"01:09:28,915","01:09:30,125",Was this really necessary?
881,"01:09:30,250","01:09:32,002",I feel as if I'm at some
882,"01:09:32,127","01:09:34,129",American political convention.
883,"01:09:34,504","01:09:36,631","Well, it isn't going to
take long."
884,"01:09:36,756","01:09:39,134","Our friend here
doesn't have sufficient support"
885,"01:09:39,259","01:09:41,219","amongst our colleagues to be
elected Pope."
886,"01:09:41,344","01:09:42,344",It isn't over yet.
887,"01:09:42,429","01:09:43,305","Well, I'm afraid,"
888,"01:09:43,430","01:09:45,056","as far as I'm concerned, it is."
889,"01:09:46,975","01:09:49,269","So, now the question arises,"
890,"01:09:49,394","01:09:50,979","if I can't win,"
891,"01:09:51,855","01:09:55,150","whom do I advise
my supporters to vote for?"
892,"01:09:57,903","01:09:58,903","Thomas,"
893,"01:09:58,945","01:10:00,488",I am no more an enthusiast
894,"01:10:00,614","01:10:02,198",for Tremblay than you are.
895,"01:10:02,949","01:10:05,493","But... we have to face the fact
that..."
896,"01:10:18,840","01:10:20,717",We have to face the fact
897,"01:10:20,842","01:10:23,053","that he has demonstrated broad
appeal."
898,"01:10:24,971","01:10:27,182",Maybe he'll be a unifying force.
899,"01:10:27,849","01:10:29,768","- What?
- Is this what we're reduced to,"
900,"01:10:29,893","01:10:33,897","considering the least
worst option?"
901,"01:10:34,022","01:10:35,523",But the field has narrowed.
902,"01:10:36,149","01:10:38,693","If we don't change our vote,
we will be here for weeks."
903,"01:10:38,818","01:10:40,946","And that's exactly what
Tedesco wants."
904,"01:10:41,071","01:10:42,989","We've had a Pope who was
in the Hitler Youth"
905,"01:10:43,114","01:10:44,324",and fought for the Nazis.
906,"01:10:44,449","01:10:45,742",We've had Popes accused of
907,"01:10:45,867","01:10:48,411","colluding with communists
and fascists."
908,"01:10:48,536","01:10:50,538","We've had Popes who have
ignored reports"
909,"01:10:50,664","01:10:52,791","of most appalling sexual abuse
of children!"
910,"01:10:52,916","01:10:54,334",Shh. Okay. Shh-shh!
911,"01:10:55,460","01:10:56,544",We take the point.
912,"01:10:56,670","01:10:59,631","The point is we will never
find a candidate"
913,"01:10:59,756","01:11:03,134","who doesn't have any kind of
black mark against them."
914,"01:11:03,259","01:11:05,220",We're mortal men.
915,"01:11:05,345","01:11:06,680",We serve an ideal.
916,"01:11:07,639","01:11:09,766",We cannot always be ideal.
917,"01:11:16,731","01:11:17,774",Then we're agreed.
918,"01:11:18,733","01:11:21,778","We urge all our supporters to
back Tremblay."
919,"01:11:23,863","01:11:24,863",Good.
920,"01:11:33,331","01:11:35,375","The other night, you were
kind enough"
921,"01:11:35,500","01:11:37,460","to say that
you had voted for me."
922,"01:11:38,586","01:11:40,630","Now, I don't know if you've
continued to do so,"
923,"01:11:40,755","01:11:45,010","but if you have, then I must
repeat my plea to you to stop."
924,"01:11:46,511","01:11:47,512",Why?
925,"01:11:47,887","01:11:50,515","Well, firstly, I lack the
spiritual depth"
926,"01:11:50,640","01:11:51,683",to be Pope.
927,"01:11:52,559","01:11:54,561","Secondly,
I couldn't possibly win."
928,"01:11:55,061","01:11:56,521","A long, drawn-out Conclave"
929,"01:11:56,646","01:11:58,606","would be seen by the media
as proof"
930,"01:11:58,732","01:12:00,984",that the Church is in crisis.
931,"01:12:01,109","01:12:03,361","You have come to ask me to vote
for Cardinal Tremblay?"
932,"01:12:03,486","01:12:06,364","Yes, I have, and to urge your
supporters to do the same."
933,"01:12:06,990","01:12:09,200","Cardinal Tremblay already spoke
to me about this."
934,"01:12:09,325","01:12:10,785","Oh, well, I'm sure he has."
935,"01:12:11,161","01:12:13,997","You want me to vote for a man
you see as ambitious?"
936,"01:12:16,082","01:12:18,835","I do not want to see Tedesco
as Pope."
937,"01:12:19,461","01:12:22,672","He would take our church back
to... to an earlier era."
938,"01:12:23,006","01:12:25,216","I'm sorry, but I cannot vote
for a man"
939,"01:12:25,341","01:12:27,927","unless I deem him
the most worthy to be Pope."
940,"01:12:28,511","01:12:30,930","And for me, that is not
Tremblay."
941,"01:12:31,723","01:12:32,723",It's you.
942,"01:12:33,600","01:12:35,935",I don't want your vote!
943,"01:12:36,061","01:12:38,521",Nevertheless... you have it.
944,"01:13:11,638","01:13:14,516","Sister Shanumi is on her way
home to Nigeria."
945,"01:13:15,558","01:13:17,936","There was a flight to Lagos
this evening,"
946,"01:13:18,061","01:13:21,147","and I thought it was best for
everyone if she was on it."
947,"01:13:21,856","01:13:24,526","How did Sister Shanumi come to
be in Rome?"
948,"01:13:25,360","01:13:27,654","I received notification from
the office"
949,"01:13:27,779","01:13:31,032","of the Superioress General that
she would be joining us."
950,"01:13:31,699","01:13:33,701","The arrangements were made
in Paris."
951,"01:13:33,827","01:13:35,328","You should Rue de Bac,
Your Eminence."
952,"01:13:35,453","01:13:37,080","I would, except of course, I am"
953,"01:13:37,205","01:13:39,666","sequestered for the duration of
the Conclave."
954,"01:13:40,375","01:13:41,835","Then you should ask them
afterwards."
955,"01:13:43,670","01:13:47,006","Err, the information is of value
to me now."
956,"01:13:51,886","01:13:54,722","Sister Agnes, I know that you
were close to the Holy Father."
957,"01:13:55,807","01:13:58,393","When I tried to resign as Dean,
he wouldn't let me."
958,"01:13:59,936","01:14:02,647","I couldn't understand why at
the time, but..."
959,"01:14:02,772","01:14:04,440",now I think I do.
960,"01:14:06,568","01:14:08,820","I think the Holy Father knew
he was dying,"
961,"01:14:08,945","01:14:13,992","and for some reason he wanted me
to run this Conclave."
962,"01:14:14,117","01:14:16,327",Which is what I'm trying to do.
963,"01:14:19,747","01:14:20,747",For him.
964,"01:15:19,057","01:15:20,725","I would like you to withdraw
your name"
965,"01:15:20,850","01:15:21,893",from the next ballot.
966,"01:15:23,686","01:15:25,480","You are not the right man
to be Pope."
967,"01:15:26,231","01:15:27,315","Er, well..."
968,"01:15:27,440","01:15:28,441",40 of our colleagues
969,"01:15:28,566","01:15:29,793",would disagree with you on that.
970,"01:15:29,817","01:15:31,903","That's because they don't know
you as I do."
971,"01:15:33,988","01:15:35,448","This is sad, Thomas."
972,"01:15:36,866","01:15:38,243",I shall pray for you.
973,"01:15:38,368","01:15:39,661",I know there was some kind of
974,"01:15:39,786","01:15:41,120",report into your activities.
975,"01:15:41,704","01:15:43,664","I know the Holy Father raised
the matter with you"
976,"01:15:43,706","01:15:44,749",hours before he died.
977,"01:15:44,874","01:15:46,918","And that he dismissed you
from all your posts."
978,"01:15:47,043","01:15:49,045","And I know that somehow
you discovered"
979,"01:15:49,170","01:15:52,131","Adeyemi's surrender to
temptation 30 years ago,"
980,"01:15:52,257","01:15:54,092","and that you arranged for
the woman involved"
981,"01:15:54,217","01:15:55,260","to be brought to Rome,"
982,"01:15:55,385","01:15:56,511",with the express intention
983,"01:15:56,636","01:15:58,596",of destroying Adeyemi's chances
984,"01:15:58,721","01:15:59,721",of becoming Pope.
985,"01:15:59,764","01:16:01,015",I deny that accusation.
986,"01:16:01,140","01:16:03,893","Will you deny asking our
Superioress to transfer"
987,"01:16:04,018","01:16:05,395",one of her sisters to Rome?
988,"01:16:05,520","01:16:07,855","- No. I asked her.
- Hmm."
989,"01:16:07,981","01:16:10,221","- But not on my own behalf.
- Well, on whose behalf then?"
990,"01:16:10,316","01:16:11,526",The Holy Father's.
991,"01:16:11,651","01:16:14,028","You would libel the Holy Father
in his own home?"
992,"01:16:14,153","01:16:17,156","It isn't libel, it's the truth!"
993,"01:16:17,949","01:16:20,326","The Holy Father gave me
the name of a sister"
994,"01:16:20,451","01:16:23,663","and asked me to make a private
request to bring her to Rome."
995,"01:16:24,163","01:16:25,790",I have no idea why.
996,"01:16:25,915","01:16:27,875",And now you have chosen to...
997,"01:16:31,713","01:16:33,339","You should be careful, Thomas."
998,"01:16:35,717","01:16:38,720","Your own ambition has not
gone unnoticed."
999,"01:16:39,721","01:16:43,850","This might be seen as a tactic
to blacken the name of a rival."
1000,"01:16:43,975","01:16:45,601","Well, that's a despicable
accusation."
1001,"01:16:45,727","01:16:46,727",Is it?
1002,"01:16:47,812","01:16:48,812",I wonder...
1003,"01:16:50,189","01:16:53,735","if you really are so
very reluctant"
1004,"01:16:53,860","01:16:56,362","to have the chalice
passed to you."
1005,"01:17:01,326","01:17:04,370","I shall pretend this
conversation never took place."
1006,"01:17:09,625","01:17:11,127",But it has taken place!
1007,"01:23:25,584","01:23:27,795","It's the report on
the activities of Tremblay."
1008,"01:23:27,920","01:23:30,881","It's an overwhelming prima
facie case that he is guilty"
1009,"01:23:31,006","01:23:33,217","of simony, which, of course,
is an offence stipulated"
1010,"01:23:33,342","01:23:35,237","in the Holy Scriptures...
- I'm aware of what simony is,"
1011,"01:23:35,261","01:23:36,381","thank you.
- He only obtained"
1012,"01:23:36,470","01:23:37,823","all those votes
in the first ballot"
1013,"01:23:37,847","01:23:39,014",because he bought them.
1014,"01:23:39,974","01:23:42,935","Cardenas, Diene, Figarella,
Baptiste..."
1015,"01:23:44,061","01:23:45,730",And all this in the last twelve months
1016,"01:23:45,855","01:23:47,648","when he must have
guessed the Holy Father's"
1017,"01:23:47,773","01:23:49,692","pontificate was... was coming
to an end."
1018,"01:23:49,817","01:23:51,610","How do we know that this money
wasn't used"
1019,"01:23:51,736","01:23:53,863","for completely
legitimate purposes?"
1020,"01:23:53,988","01:23:55,990","Because I have seen their bank
statements."
1021,"01:23:58,701","01:24:00,061","- Dear God.
- Seems the Holy Father"
1022,"01:24:00,119","01:24:01,746",was spying on all of us.
1023,"01:24:03,789","01:24:05,040",He didn't trust anyone.
1024,"01:24:06,834","01:24:08,127",Where did you get this?
1025,"01:24:10,171","01:24:11,255",You broke the seals.
1026,"01:24:11,380","01:24:12,840",I felt I didn't have a choice.
1027,"01:24:12,965","01:24:14,592","I suspected Tremblay
of bringing"
1028,"01:24:14,717","01:24:17,720","that poor woman from
Africa to embarrass Adeyemi."
1029,"01:24:18,137","01:24:20,973","You must continue with your
candidacy, Aldo."
1030,"01:24:26,771","01:24:27,771",Put them back.
1031,"01:24:29,648","01:24:34,445","Put them back, or burn them,
or... just... put them back."
1032,"01:24:34,904","01:24:37,198","I could never become Pope in
these circumstances."
1033,"01:24:37,323","01:24:39,742","A stolen document, the smearing
of a brother cardinal."
1034,"01:24:39,867","01:24:41,827","I'd be the
Richard Nixon of Popes."
1035,"01:24:41,952","01:24:43,579","Then stay clear of this,
leave it to me."
1036,"01:24:43,704","01:24:45,414","I'm willing to handle
the consequences."
1037,"01:24:45,539","01:24:47,374","You know who's gonna benefit
most from this?"
1038,"01:24:48,250","01:24:50,002",Tedesco.
1039,"01:24:50,127","01:24:52,004","The whole basis of his
candidacy"
1040,"01:24:52,129","01:24:55,424","is that the Holy Father
led the church to disaster"
1041,"01:24:55,549","01:24:57,259",by his attempts at reform.
1042,"01:24:57,384","01:24:59,178","If you reveal this report,"
1043,"01:24:59,845","01:25:02,014","it isn't Tremblay's reputation
that's going to suffer,"
1044,"01:25:02,473","01:25:03,557",it's the Church's.
1045,"01:25:04,809","01:25:08,479","Accusing the Curia of
institutional corruption..."
1046,"01:25:08,604","01:25:11,982","I thought we were here to serve
God, not the Curia."
1047,"01:25:12,107","01:25:13,651","Oh, don't be naÃ¯ve!"
1048,"01:25:19,114","01:25:20,115",Put them back.
1049,"01:25:22,743","01:25:24,787",And have Tremblay as Pope?
1050,"01:25:24,912","01:25:25,996",We've had worse.
1051,"01:25:32,127","01:25:33,170",What has he offered you?
1052,"01:25:35,214","01:25:36,632",Secretary of State?
1053,"01:25:42,972","01:25:46,475","Five times I cast my vote
for you, Aldo."
1054,"01:25:48,185","01:25:49,353",But I was wrong.
1055,"01:25:50,896","01:25:53,274","You lack the courage required
to be Pope."
1056,"01:26:10,875","01:26:12,918","I will do that
for you, Your Eminence"
1057,"01:26:13,794","01:26:14,879",Oh.
1058,"01:26:20,426","01:26:22,136",How many copies do you require?
1059,"01:26:22,803","01:26:24,305","Er, 108."
1060,"01:26:43,240","01:26:45,618","You are responsible for this,
I believe."
1061,"01:26:46,785","01:26:48,662","No, Eminence. You are."
1062,"01:26:50,247","01:26:54,084","This report is entirely
mendacious."
1063,"01:26:54,209","01:26:55,878","It would never have seen
the light of day"
1064,"01:26:56,003","01:26:57,755",if you had not broken into
1065,"01:26:57,880","01:27:00,007","the Holy Father's apartment to
remove it!"
1066,"01:27:00,132","01:27:01,383","If the report is mendacious,"
1067,"01:27:01,508","01:27:02,968",then why did the Holy Father
1068,"01:27:03,093","01:27:04,970",in his last official act as Pope
1069,"01:27:05,095","01:27:06,263",ask you to resign?
1070,"01:27:06,388","01:27:07,806",He did no such thing.
1071,"01:27:08,307","01:27:10,588","As Monsignor Morales,
who was at the meeting..."
1072,"01:27:10,851","01:27:13,520","And yet Archbishop Wozniak
insists the Holy Father..."
1073,"01:27:13,646","01:27:14,646","The Holy Father,"
1074,"01:27:14,688","01:27:15,940",may his name be numbered
1075,"01:27:16,065","01:27:17,232","among the high priests,"
1076,"01:27:17,358","01:27:21,028","was a sick man toward
the end of his life,"
1077,"01:27:21,487","01:27:25,157","as those of us who saw him
regularly can attest."
1078,"01:27:26,951","01:27:29,536","If I may join
this amiable dialogue."
1079,"01:27:29,662","01:27:31,080",I want to remind you that
1080,"01:27:31,205","01:27:34,667","the names of eight cardinals
have been obscured."
1081,"01:27:36,835","01:27:39,088","I assume the dean can tell us
who they are?"
1082,"01:27:39,213","01:27:40,798",Let them tell us themselves
1083,"01:27:41,173","01:27:42,341",here and now.
1084,"01:27:42,925","01:27:44,343",Here and now!
1085,"01:27:44,468","01:27:47,012","If Cardinal Tremblay
requested their votes"
1086,"01:27:47,137","01:27:48,430",in return for the money...
1087,"01:27:48,555","01:27:49,915","No, I won't do that."
1088,"01:27:51,475","01:27:54,895","Let each man examine his
conscience, as I have."
1089,"01:27:55,854","01:27:59,650","I have no desire to create
bitterness in this Conclave,"
1090,"01:27:59,775","01:28:02,444","and I will be happy to stand
down as Dean."
1091,"01:28:17,167","01:28:18,167",Eminences.
1092,"01:28:19,378","01:28:22,172","Although we sisters are
supposed to be invisible,"
1093,"01:28:22,297","01:28:26,927","God has nevertheless given us
eyes and ears."
1094,"01:28:27,052","01:28:29,013","I know what prompted the Dean
of the College"
1095,"01:28:29,138","01:28:32,558","to enter
the Holy Father's rooms."
1096,"01:28:32,683","01:28:35,019","He was concerned that
the sister from my order"
1097,"01:28:35,144","01:28:37,896",that made that regrettable scene
1098,"01:28:38,022","01:28:39,857",might have been brought to Rome
1099,"01:28:39,982","01:28:42,067",with the deliberate intention
1100,"01:28:42,651","01:28:45,404","of embarrassing a member of
this Conclave."
1101,"01:28:46,572","01:28:48,449",His suspicions were correct.
1102,"01:28:49,825","01:28:52,327","She was indeed here at
the specific request"
1103,"01:28:52,453","01:28:53,954",of Cardinal Tremblay.
1104,"01:29:13,432","01:29:14,432",My brothers...
1105,"01:29:15,809","01:29:16,809",it's true.
1106,"01:29:18,020","01:29:20,981",But the Holy Father asked me to.
1107,"01:29:22,608","01:29:25,360",I had no knowledge
1108,"01:29:25,486","01:29:27,529","who this woman was,
I swear to you."
1109,"01:29:32,910","01:29:33,994",Judas.
1110,"01:29:34,578","01:29:35,788",Traitor.
1111,"01:30:06,777","01:30:09,137","It seems that
we're running out of favourites."
1112,"01:30:12,991","01:30:14,743","You must take over
the supervision"
1113,"01:30:14,868","01:30:16,245","of this election, Aldo."
1114,"01:30:17,788","01:30:18,872","Oh, no thank you."
1115,"01:30:21,583","01:30:23,418",You are steering this Conclave.
1116,"01:30:25,087","01:30:27,422","Exactly where, I do not know."
1117,"01:30:28,382","01:30:31,260","But that firm hand of yours
has its admirers."
1118,"01:30:37,224","01:30:40,435","Thomas I've come to ask...
for your forgiveness."
1119,"01:30:44,773","01:30:46,400",I had the temerity...
1120,"01:30:47,359","01:30:50,988","to tell you to examine...
your heart,"
1121,"01:30:51,113","01:30:53,198","when all the time it was
my own that..."
1122,"01:30:59,580","01:31:00,789",It's shameful...
1123,"01:31:03,041","01:31:06,461","to be this age
and still not know yourself."
1124,"01:31:06,587","01:31:09,464","Ambition, 'The moth of
holiness.'"
1125,"01:31:13,594","01:31:14,720",I'm sorry.
1126,"01:31:19,600","01:31:23,520","So, perhaps it's time you
decided... upon a name."
1127,"01:31:26,231","01:31:28,358","As the next most senior member
of this Conclave,"
1128,"01:31:28,483","01:31:30,152",it will fall to me to ask you
1129,"01:31:30,277","01:31:32,070","how you wish to be known
as Pope."
1130,"01:31:34,948","01:31:36,283","For better or for worse,"
1131,"01:31:36,408","01:31:38,118","it would seem that Tremblay
is finished."
1132,"01:31:40,579","01:31:42,748","This is a contest between
Tedesco and you."
1133,"01:31:43,165","01:31:44,917","You're the only one who can
stop him now."
1134,"01:31:53,133","01:31:54,133",John.
1135,"01:31:56,094","01:31:57,596",I would choose John.
1136,"01:34:33,585","01:34:34,812",Everyone has been taken back
1137,"01:34:34,836","01:34:35,962","to the Casa Santa Marta,"
1138,"01:34:36,088","01:34:37,172",Your Eminence.
1139,"01:34:37,297","01:34:38,337",No one was seriously hurt.
1140,"01:34:38,382","01:34:39,508","Some cuts, that's all."
1141,"01:34:41,093","01:34:43,553","Outside in the city,
how bad is it?"
1142,"01:34:57,567","01:34:58,735","Oh, dear God."
1143,"01:35:03,365","01:35:05,700","At 11:20 this morning,"
1144,"01:35:06,201","01:35:10,122","a car bomb exploded in
the Piazza del Risorgimento."
1145,"01:35:10,455","01:35:13,667","Shortly afterwards, as people
were fleeing the scene,"
1146,"01:35:14,251","01:35:17,170","an individual with explosives

attacks in Louvain and Munich."
1149,"01:35:24,261","01:35:26,263",The current death toll stands...
1150,"01:35:27,514","01:35:28,598",at 52.
1151,"01:35:30,308","01:35:31,935",Hundreds have been injured.
1152,"01:35:32,936","01:35:33,936","Well, then."
1153,"01:35:34,354","01:35:38,942","Here at last we see the result of
the doctrine of relativism"
1154,"01:35:39,067","01:35:42,320","so beloved by our liberal
brothers!"
1155,"01:35:44,281","01:35:48,702","A relativism that sees all
faiths and passing fancies"
1156,"01:35:49,119","01:35:50,954",accorded equal weight.
1157,"01:35:51,079","01:35:53,290","So that now, when we look
around us, we see the homeland"
1158,"01:35:53,415","01:35:55,208","of the Holy Roman
Catholic Church"
1159,"01:35:56,001","01:35:58,712","dotted with the mosques
and minarets"

1161,"01:36:00,088","01:36:01,566",You should be ashamed ashamed.
1162,"01:36:01,590","01:36:02,590",Ashamed. Ashamed.
1163,"01:36:02,674","01:36:04,301",We should all be ashamed!
1164,"01:36:04,426","01:36:08,513","We tolerate Islam in our land,"
1165,"01:36:08,889","01:36:10,390",but they revile us in theirs.
1166,"01:36:10,515","01:36:13,810","We nourish them
in our homelands."
1167,"01:36:14,728","01:36:16,062",But they exterminate us.
1168,"01:36:16,188","01:36:19,232","How long will we persist in
this weakness?"
1169,"01:36:19,357","01:36:21,902","They are literally at our walls
right now."
1170,"01:36:22,027","01:36:25,238","What we need now is a leader
who understands"
1171,"01:36:25,363","01:36:29,117","that we are facing
a true religious war."
1172,"01:36:29,451","01:36:30,785",Do not touch me!
1173,"01:36:32,537","01:36:34,247","Yes, a religious war."
1174,"01:36:34,372","01:36:37,292","We need a leader who will
put a stop to the drift"
1175,"01:36:37,417","01:36:40,295","that has gone on almost ceaselessly
for the past 50 years."
1176,"01:36:40,420","01:36:42,589","How long will we have to
persist in this weakness,"
1177,"01:36:42,714","01:36:43,714",how long?
1178,"01:36:43,757","01:36:45,800",We need a leader...
1179,"01:36:46,259","01:36:48,512",...who fights these animals!
1180,"01:36:54,559","01:36:56,811","Is this the man you
want to lead us?"
1181,"01:37:00,982","01:37:02,400",My brother cardinal...
1182,"01:37:09,491","01:37:10,951",With respect.
1183,"01:37:13,161","01:37:14,663",What do you know about war?
1184,"01:37:18,333","01:37:21,169","I carried out my ministry
in the Congo."
1185,"01:37:21,294","01:37:23,088","In Baghdad, in Kabul."
1186,"01:37:25,006","01:37:27,842","I've seen the lines of the dead
and wondered,"
1187,"01:37:27,968","01:37:29,803",Christian and Muslim.
1188,"01:37:33,306","01:37:35,559",Would you say we have to fight?
1189,"01:37:36,935","01:37:38,728","What is it you think
we're fighting?"
1190,"01:37:40,230","01:37:41,606","Do you think it's those
deluded men"
1191,"01:37:41,731","01:37:44,609","who had carried out these
terrible acts today?"
1192,"01:37:46,111","01:37:47,153","No, my brother."
1193,"01:37:48,113","01:37:50,113",The thing you're fighting is here...
1194,"01:37:51,700","01:37:53,451","inside each and every one of us,"
1195,"01:37:54,160","01:37:56,496","if we give in to hate now,"
1196,"01:37:58,248","01:37:59,833","if we speak of ""sides"""
1197,"01:37:59,958","01:38:02,752","instead of speaking
for every man and woman."
1198,"01:38:05,088","01:38:07,340","This is my first time here, amongst you,"
1199,"01:38:07,799","01:38:09,676",and I suppose it will be my last.
1200,"01:38:12,095","01:38:17,309","Forgive me, but these last few days
we have shown ourselves to be small petty men,"
1201,"01:38:19,561","01:38:21,855","we have seemed concerned
only with ourselves,"
1202,"01:38:23,356","01:38:24,356","with Rome,"
1203,"01:38:24,816","01:38:26,568","with these elections, with power."
1204,"01:38:28,903","01:38:30,780",But things are not the Church.
1205,"01:38:32,866","01:38:34,534",The Church is not tradition.
1206,"01:38:35,619","01:38:37,329",The Church is not the past.
1207,"01:38:39,873","01:38:42,417",The Church is what we do next.
1208,"01:40:16,678","01:40:17,846",We pray.
1209,"01:40:17,971","01:40:22,100","O Father, so that we may guide"
1210,"01:40:22,225","01:40:25,645",and watch over Your Church.
1211,"01:40:25,770","01:40:27,480","Give to us, Your servants,"
1212,"01:40:27,605","01:40:31,317","the blessings of intelligence,
truth and peace,"
1213,"01:40:31,735","01:40:35,989","so that we may strive to know
Your will,"
1214,"01:40:36,114","01:40:40,076","and serve You
total dedication."
1215,"01:40:43,079","01:40:44,998",For Christ our Lord.
1216,"01:40:45,123","01:40:46,416",Amen.

1220,"01:42:35,358","01:42:36,734",Lawrence.
1221,"01:43:35,835","01:43:41,132","Do you accept your canonical
election as Supreme Pontiff?"
1222,"01:43:49,724","01:43:55,605","Do you accept your canonical
election as Supreme Pontiff?"
1223,"01:44:03,154","01:44:04,154",I accept.
1224,"01:44:07,241","01:44:09,452","And by what name do you
wish to be called?"
1225,"01:44:14,582","01:44:16,000",Innocent.
1226,"01:44:49,242","01:44:50,702",Monsignor.
1227,"01:44:51,035","01:44:53,204",I'm sorry to interrupt.
1228,"01:44:54,205","01:44:55,205",Ray...
1229,"01:44:57,667","01:44:59,877","I think you should gather
up the cardinals' notes."
1230,"01:45:00,003","01:45:01,254","The sooner we light the stove,"
1231,"01:45:01,379","01:45:02,579",the sooner the world will know
1232,"01:45:02,630","01:45:03,715",we have a new Pope.
1233,"01:45:06,801","01:45:07,844",What is it?
1234,"01:45:09,929","01:45:10,972",It wasn't...
1235,"01:45:11,931","01:45:13,766",wasn't the outcome I expected.
1236,"01:45:13,891","01:45:15,852","No, but it's wonderful
all the same."
1237,"01:45:17,937","01:45:19,415","If it's my position you're
worried about,"
1238,"01:45:19,439","01:45:21,816","I can reassure you I feel
nothing but relief."
1239,"01:45:22,984","01:45:25,069","Our new Holy Father will make
a much better Pope"
1240,"01:45:25,194","01:45:26,696",than I would ever have done.
1241,"01:45:33,036","01:45:35,830","I wonder if I could have a word
in private."
1242,"01:45:38,416","01:45:40,960","I should have told you this
morning when I found out, but..."
1243,"01:45:42,045","01:45:43,045",with everything that...
1244,"01:45:43,087","01:45:45,048",And I didn't dream
1245,"01:45:45,173","01:45:47,050","that Cardinal Benitez would
become..."
1246,"01:45:47,175","01:45:49,594","Ray, please, tell me what's
troubling you."
1247,"01:45:52,555","01:45:53,723",I found out...
1248,"01:45:54,682","01:45:55,682",Switzerland.
1249,"01:45:56,559","01:45:58,686","Cardinal Benitez's trip
to Switzerland."
1250,"01:45:58,811","01:46:01,689","Switzerland, the... the hospital
in Geneva, yes?"
1251,"01:46:03,566","01:46:05,026",It wasn't a hospital.
1252,"01:46:05,818","01:46:06,986",It was a clinic.
1253,"01:46:10,156","01:46:11,532",A clinic for what?
1254,"01:46:25,171","01:46:27,465","Eminence,
His Holiness won't get robed."
1255,"01:46:27,590","01:46:28,590",With permission.
1256,"01:46:34,222","01:46:35,848",May I speak to you alone?
1257,"01:46:35,973","01:46:36,973",\an8Of course.
1258,"01:46:37,058","01:46:38,898","Gentlemen, let's clear the room."
1259,"01:46:46,442","01:46:48,402",I was waiting for you to come.
1260,"01:46:48,528","01:46:50,238","You must tell me about
this treatment"
1261,"01:46:50,363","01:46:51,948",at the clinic in Geneva.
1262,"01:46:53,491","01:46:55,159","- Must I, Dean?
- Yes, you must."
1263,"01:46:55,910","01:46:58,579","Within the hour you will be the
most famous man in the world,"
1264,"01:46:58,704","01:47:03,209","so please tell me,
what is your... situation?"
1265,"01:47:05,169","01:47:07,171","My situation, as you put it,"
1266,"01:47:08,047","01:47:10,466","is the same as when I was
ordained a priest,"
1267,"01:47:11,551","01:47:13,469",and when I was made a cardinal.
1268,"01:47:13,594","01:47:15,805",But the treatment... in Geneva?
1269,"01:47:15,930","01:47:17,348",There was no treatment.
1270,"01:47:18,141","01:47:19,600",I considered it.
1271,"01:47:19,725","01:47:21,936","I prayed for guidance
and decided against it."
1272,"01:47:22,061","01:47:24,397","But what would it have been,
this treatment?"
1273,"01:47:26,941","01:47:30,361","It was called a laparoscopic
hysterectomy."
1274,"01:48:17,325","01:48:18,951","You have to understand,"
1275,"01:48:21,120","01:48:24,665","when I was a child, there was
no way of knowing my situation"
1276,"01:48:24,790","01:48:26,250",was more complicated.
1277,"01:48:28,169","01:48:30,338",And life in the seminary is...
1278,"01:48:30,463","01:48:31,589","as you know,"
1279,"01:48:31,714","01:48:33,216",a very modest one.
1280,"01:48:35,801","01:48:37,053",The truth is...
1281,"01:48:37,386","01:48:38,846","there simply was no reason
to think"
1282,"01:48:38,971","01:48:40,011",I was physically different
1283,"01:48:40,097","01:48:41,349",from the other young men.
1284,"01:48:42,934","01:48:45,061","Then, in my late 30s,"
1285,"01:48:46,020","01:48:49,565","I had a surgery to remove
my appendix."
1286,"01:48:51,192","01:48:53,402","And that was when the doctors
discovered..."
1287,"01:48:54,362","01:48:57,782","that I had a uterus...
and ovaries."
1288,"01:48:59,158","01:49:00,493",Some would say
1289,"01:49:00,618","01:49:03,871","my chromosomes would define
me as being a woman,"
1290,"01:49:05,122","01:49:06,624",and yet I'm also...
1291,"01:49:07,500","01:49:08,668",as you see me.
1292,"01:49:20,221","01:49:22,598",It was a very dark time for me.
1293,"01:49:22,723","01:49:24,684",I felt as if my entire life as a priest
1294,"01:49:24,809","01:49:26,936","had been lived in
a state of sin."
1295,"01:49:28,729","01:49:31,732","Of course, I offered my
resignation to the Holy Father."
1296,"01:49:32,233","01:49:34,485","I flew to Rome and I told him
everything."
1297,"01:49:37,154","01:49:38,239",He knew?
1298,"01:49:39,740","01:49:42,285","Yes, he knew."
1299,"01:49:42,410","01:49:44,328","And he thought it acceptable
for you"
1300,"01:49:44,453","01:49:47,164","to continue as
an ordained minister?"
1301,"01:49:48,416","01:49:52,044","We considered surgery to remove
the female parts of my body,"
1302,"01:49:52,169","01:49:54,797","but the night before I was due
to fly,"
1303,"01:49:54,922","01:49:56,841",I realised I was mistaken.
1304,"01:49:58,092","01:50:00,303",I was who I had always been.
1305,"01:50:02,763","01:50:04,390",It seemed to me more of a sin
1306,"01:50:04,515","01:50:07,810","to change His handiwork than
to leave my body as it was."
1307,"01:50:10,521","01:50:13,274","So, you are still, erm..."
1308,"01:50:15,318","01:50:16,986",I am what God made me.
1309,"01:50:18,946","01:50:22,950","And perhaps it is my difference
that will make me more useful."
1310,"01:50:25,453","01:50:27,204",I think again of your sermon.
1311,"01:50:29,582","01:50:32,585",I know what it is to exist...
1312,"01:50:32,710","01:50:35,171",between the world's certainties.
1313,"01:52:55,853","01:52:56,853",Hmm.
