It's no trouble."

824,"01:10:04,432","01:10:07,055","Oh, yes, of course."

a missing person's case."

for is your colleague,"

833,"01:10:26,391","01:10:28,180","We were assisting a patient,"
834,"01:10:28,182","01:10:30,430","a particularly
challenging patient."
835,"01:10:30,432","01:10:31,848","Ah, yes."
836,"01:10:31,850","01:10:34,182",Mrs. Mary Thomas.
837,"01:10:36,350","01:10:38,264","Yes, that's correct."
838,"01:10:38,266","01:10:40,139","Yes, I'd like for you
to arrange a meeting"

Thomas if possible."
840,"01:10:42,225","01:10:46,139","I'm afraid that
won't be possible."
841,"01:10:46,141","01:10:48,180","I can organize a
warrant if need be."
842,"01:10:48,182","01:10:50,639","You misunderstand
me, constable."
843,"01:10:50,641","01:10:52,348","Following her
treatment, Mary Thomas"
844,"01:10:52,350","01:10:55,391","is not capable of
talking to anyone."
845,"01:10:58,891","01:10:59,975",Mm.
846,"01:11:01,100","01:11:03,639","Doctor Powell is
relatively new here,"
847,"01:11:03,641","01:11:05,180",learning the ropes.
848,"01:11:05,182","01:11:08,389","He gets emotionally
attached to the patients."
849,"01:11:08,391","01:11:11,058",He can almost feel their pain.
850,"01:11:12,350","01:11:14,223","I suggested he left
early that day,"
851,"01:11:14,225","01:11:17,139","took some time away
from the asylum,"
852,"01:11:17,141","01:11:18,808",to clear his head.
853,"01:11:19,641","01:11:21,264",I believe it was about...
854,"01:11:21,266","01:11:24,600","Let's stick to facts,
shall we, doctor?"
855,"01:11:26,182","01:11:29,598","I sent him home
at four o'clock."
856,"01:11:29,600","01:11:33,348","Well, that completely
contradicts what his wife says."
857,"01:11:33,350","01:11:36,680","Mrs. Powell said that he
was here working all night."
858,"01:11:36,682","01:11:37,889",Impossible.
859,"01:11:37,891","01:11:39,308",And you're sure?
860,"01:11:40,350","01:11:41,930",I remember it vividly.
861,"01:11:41,932","01:11:43,180",I wished him well.
862,"01:11:43,182","01:11:45,555","He thanked me for
allowing him time away"
863,"01:11:45,557","01:11:49,139","and he walked out of
site, off the grounds."
864,"01:11:49,141","01:11:50,975",What was he wearing?
865,"01:11:53,682","01:11:56,180",I don't recall.
866,"01:11:56,182","01:11:59,475","And yet you say you
remember it vividly."
867,"01:12:00,432","01:12:02,432","He wore a hat, a coat."
868,"01:12:03,557","01:12:06,055","What was the
color of this coat?"
869,"01:12:06,057","01:12:07,139",Is that important?
870,"01:12:07,141","01:12:08,975",Answer the question.
871,"01:12:12,391","01:12:13,973",Gray.
872,"01:12:13,975","01:12:18,264","A statement that matches
that of Mrs. Powell's at last."
873,"01:12:18,266","01:12:20,600",He always wore a gray coat.
874,"01:12:22,266","01:12:26,680",Perhaps...
875,"01:12:26,682","01:12:27,515",...this.
876,"01:12:32,682","01:12:36,223","An odd thing to forget
whilst walking home"
877,"01:12:36,225","01:12:40,266","on a dismal day in December,
wouldn't you agree?"
878,"01:12:41,766","01:12:46,016","I spotted this gray coat
buried on the staff coat rack."
879,"01:12:47,225","01:12:52,139","It matched the coat description
his wife described exactly."
880,"01:12:52,141","01:12:54,141",The last time she saw him.
881,"01:12:55,266","01:12:58,014",We all own a gray coat.
882,"01:12:58,016","01:13:00,848","What attributes this
particular coat to him?"
883,"01:13:00,850","01:13:02,723","A prescription
in the left pocket"
884,"01:13:02,725","01:13:06,055",to Mr. C. Powell.
885,"01:13:06,057","01:13:08,930",Maybe he left it behind.
886,"01:13:08,932","01:13:12,348","Some may suggest he
didn't leave at all."
887,"01:13:12,350","01:13:15,098","And what does
it suggest to you?"
888,"01:13:15,100","01:13:18,723","I'm merely here
to ask questions."
889,"01:13:18,725","01:13:21,723","Mrs. Powell received a
telephone call that evening."
890,"01:13:21,725","01:13:23,180",It was from her husband.
891,"01:13:23,182","01:13:25,305","He said how he
needed to work late"
892,"01:13:25,307","01:13:27,264","and that he had to have
a conversation with you."
893,"01:13:27,266","01:13:28,680",He seemed agitated.
894,"01:13:28,682","01:13:31,473","What could that conversation
have been about?"
895,"01:13:31,475","01:13:34,305","Something tells me you
think you already know."
896,"01:13:34,307","01:13:36,223","Did you have
that conversation?"
897,"01:13:36,225","01:13:38,348","Did you have some
sort of confrontation?"
898,"01:13:38,350","01:13:39,680",No.
899,"01:13:39,682","01:13:42,264","Mrs. Powell described her
husband's demeanor as agitated,"
900,"01:13:42,266","01:13:44,430",frustrated
901,"01:13:44,432","01:13:47,973","at the way you deal with
mentally fragile patients."
902,"01:13:47,975","01:13:50,889","My patients are like family
to me, they are family."
903,"01:13:50,891","01:13:53,139",I treat them like my own.
904,"01:13:53,141","01:13:57,391","Did Mr. Powell ever witness
you mistreating a patient?"
905,"01:13:58,225","01:14:09,055",No.
906,"01:14:09,057","01:14:12,305","You really should try
this whiskey, constable."
907,"01:14:12,307","01:14:15,180",It's Jim Watkins' favorite.
908,"01:14:15,182","01:14:19,057","Yes, Sir James Watkins,
the chief constable."
909,"01:14:20,682","01:14:22,180",You know him well?
910,"01:14:22,182","01:14:24,514",We share a love of golf.
911,"01:14:24,516","01:14:28,558","He has a good swing, but
he's a terrible putter."
912,"01:14:30,266","01:14:33,223","You should be careful what
allegations you make against me,"
913,"01:14:33,225","01:14:35,555",constable.
914,"01:14:35,557","01:14:39,725","You may find this becomes a
career-changing case for you."
915,"01:14:41,182","01:14:45,639","You sound like a man
that has something to hide."
916,"01:14:45,641","01:14:48,223","No, I'm afraid
it is Doctor Powell"
917,"01:14:48,225","01:14:50,225",who has something to hide.
918,"01:14:51,600","01:14:54,848","If you were half the
detective you think you are,"
919,"01:14:54,850","01:14:58,475","you would've searched
both his coat pockets."
920,"01:15:13,182","01:15:16,223","He would take the
wedding ring off."
921,"01:15:16,225","01:15:18,430","It was a ritual, a routine."
922,"01:15:18,432","01:15:20,223",All he told me was
923,"01:15:20,225","01:15:23,348","that when he put the wedding
ring back on in the morning,"
924,"01:15:23,350","01:15:26,848","in his mind, nothing
had happened."
925,"01:15:26,850","01:15:28,016",A mistress?
926,"01:15:29,225","01:15:32,348","Miss Powell is not the
only woman in his life."
927,"01:15:32,350","01:15:34,348","In the minds of
those around him,"
928,"01:15:34,350","01:15:37,973","he made sure he was
here on Friday night."
929,"01:15:37,975","01:15:41,600","In fact he would've
been with another woman."
930,"01:15:42,766","01:15:45,305",DC Jones I need a name.
931,"01:15:45,307","01:15:47,930","Doctor Litner
Miss Beverly Shaw."
932,"01:15:47,932","01:15:50,348",Where can I find Miss Shaw?
933,"01:15:50,350","01:15:52,264","Well, until Friday night,"
934,"01:15:52,266","01:15:56,516","you would've found her on
Church Street, number 59."
935,"01:15:58,182","01:15:59,848","Along with Miss Shaw,
I fear Doctor Powell"
936,"01:15:59,850","01:16:02,389","is another casualty of
Friday night's bombing raid"

938,"01:16:04,807","01:16:08,305",Such a tragedy.
939,"01:16:08,307","01:16:10,889","I'm afraid Doctor Powell
may remain a missing person"
940,"01:16:10,891","01:16:12,058",indefinitely.

see yourself out."
942,"01:16:18,725","01:16:21,014","Give my regards to the chief
constable when you see him,"
943,"01:16:21,016","01:16:21,850",won't you?

955,"01:17:41,182","01:17:42,765",I heard a voice

I locked the door."

971,"01:18:34,266","01:18:41,055",I lay in bed

sound of a child crying"
