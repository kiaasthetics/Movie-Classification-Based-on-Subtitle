sounds of magical fairy dust."

49,"00:06:48,092","00:06:51,938","and sometimes I eat
instead of facing my problems!"
50,"00:06:52,342","00:06:53,523",How come you have...
51,"00:06:54,870","00:06:56,421","Ok, time for cake."

57,"00:07:18,652","00:07:19,887","Hey there, Gru."
58,"00:07:19,889","00:07:21,610",Mr. Life of the party!

61,"00:07:26,487","00:07:30,812","here but my friend
Natalie is recently single,"
62,"00:07:30,827","00:07:31,695",and...
63,"00:07:32,826","00:07:35,395","No, no, no, get off the limb right now."
64,"00:07:35,397","00:07:36,113",No limb.

66,"00:07:38,372","00:07:41,485","She sings karaoke,
she has a lot of free time,"
67,"00:07:41,487","00:07:43,450",looks aren't that important to her...
68,"00:07:44,129","00:07:45,281","No, Jills,"
69,"00:07:45,283","00:07:46,980",that is not happening.
70,"00:07:46,982","00:07:48,339","Seriously, I'm fine."
71,"00:07:48,464","00:07:49,843","Ok, fine, forget Natalie."
72,"00:07:49,845","00:07:51,852","How about my cousin Linda?
No!"
73,"00:07:52,805","00:07:54,731","I know someone whose
husband just died..."
74,"00:07:57,694","00:07:59,938","I'm sorry, I did not see you there."
75,"00:08:01,782","00:08:02,661",Or there.

78,"00:08:15,752","00:08:16,815","Ky! Kyle, no!"
79,"00:08:16,817","00:08:18,806",Do not do your business on the petunias!
80,"00:08:20,642","00:08:23,099","There you go.
Those are Fred's, go crazy."
81,"00:08:26,705","00:08:27,895",Good boy!

83,"00:08:29,593","00:08:30,963",Wha... I didn't... what? Yes?
84,"00:08:33,105","00:08:33,777",Hi!
85,"00:08:34,123","00:08:35,853",Agent Lucy Wilde of the A.V.I.

87,"00:08:40,442","00:08:41,560",you're gonna have to come with me.
88,"00:08:42,397","00:08:43,891","Sorry, I... freeze ray!"
89,"00:08:48,326","00:08:49,931","You know, you really
should not announce your weapon"
90,"00:08:49,933","00:08:51,807","after you fire them, Mr. Gru..."
91,"00:08:52,634","00:08:53,617",For example...
92,"00:08:56,657","00:08:58,628",Lipstick taser!
93,"00:08:59,849","00:09:01,233","Oh, it works so good."
94,"00:09:10,765","00:09:11,413",Man!
95,"00:09:13,365","00:09:15,227",Large person.
96,"00:09:22,888","00:09:23,609",Sorry.
97,"00:09:27,611","00:09:29,825",Get in there.
98,"00:09:30,198","00:09:30,986",You...

103,"00:10:24,211","00:10:25,793",Supermanta... da.
104,"00:11:21,903","00:11:23,781","♪ How bout my money, I ain't worried... ♪"
105,"00:12:29,282","00:12:30,516",What? Where?
106,"00:12:31,594","00:12:33,151",Foots asleep.
107,"00:12:34,526","00:12:36,208",Pins and needles!
108,"00:12:37,820","00:12:39,315","Good afternoon, Mr. Gru"
109,"00:12:40,806","00:12:43,339","I apologize for our methods
in getting you here."
110,"00:12:43,561","00:12:44,611",I don't.
111,"00:12:45,508","00:12:46,660",I'd do it again in a heartbeat.
112,"00:12:46,662","00:12:48,191","I am not gonna lie, I enjoyed that."
113,"00:12:48,230","00:12:50,838","Every second of it.
Gave me a bit of a buzz, actually."
114,"00:12:50,861","00:12:52,686","That's enough, agent Wilde."
115,"00:12:52,945","00:12:53,708","Sorry, sir."
116,"00:12:54,200","00:12:56,076","Ok, this is bogus!"
117,"00:12:56,980","00:12:59,551","I don't know who you people
think you are."
118,"00:12:59,738","00:13:02,442","But...
We are the anti-villain league."
119,"00:13:02,771","00:13:07,897","An ultra-secret organization dedicated
to fighting crime on a global scale."
120,"00:13:08,422","00:13:09,368","Rob a bank,"
121,"00:13:09,370","00:13:10,668",we're not interested.
122,"00:13:10,861","00:13:13,241","Kill someone, not our deal."
123,"00:13:13,562","00:13:16,212","But you want to melt
the polar ice caps,"
124,"00:13:16,559","00:13:18,371","or vaporize Mount Fuji,"
125,"00:13:18,512","00:13:21,834","or even, steal the moon..."
126,"00:13:22,280","00:13:24,444",Then we notice.
127,"00:13:24,514","00:13:27,198","First of all,
you got no proof that I did that."
128,"00:13:27,527","00:13:28,548","Second,"
129,"00:13:28,604","00:13:31,113","after I did do that, I put it back!"
130,"00:13:31,463","00:13:33,134","We're well aware of that, Mr. Gru"
131,"00:13:33,152","00:13:35,049",That's why we brought you here.
132,"00:13:35,252","00:13:37,082","I am the league's director,"
133,"00:13:37,310","00:13:39,355",Silas Ramsbottom.
134,"00:13:40,159","00:13:40,829",Bottom.
135,"00:13:43,832","00:13:45,039",Hilarious.
136,"00:13:46,543","00:13:47,832",Agent Wilde?
137,"00:13:48,337","00:13:49,527","Oh, me now?"
138,"00:13:50,272","00:13:52,347","Recently, an entire top-secret lab"
139,"00:13:52,349","00:13:53,823",disappeared from the arctic circle.
140,"00:13:54,010","00:13:56,151","Yeah, the entire lab, just..."
141,"00:13:57,679","00:13:59,516",Gone. Where did it go?
142,"00:13:59,822","00:14:00,917",I don't care.
143,"00:14:02,081","00:14:03,684",The lab was devoted to experiments
144,"00:14:03,686","00:14:06,940","involving PX-41,
a transmutation serum."
145,"00:14:07,107","00:14:08,803","What is PX-41, you ask?"
146,"00:14:09,682","00:14:11,326",It's pretty bad. Look.
147,"00:14:31,398","00:14:33,546",You usually don't see that in bunnies.
148,"00:14:33,758","00:14:37,913","As you can see, in the wrong hands,
the PX-41 serum"
149,"00:14:37,979","00:14:40,554","could be the most devastating
weapon on earth."
150,"00:14:42,836","00:14:44,197","Fortunately,"
151,"00:14:44,928","00:14:47,194",it has a very distinct chemical footprint.
152,"00:14:47,397","00:14:50,481","And using the latest
chem-tracking technology,"
153,"00:14:50,639","00:14:53,641",we found traces of it in the Paradise Mall.
154,"00:14:54,229","00:14:55,180",A mall?
155,"00:14:55,196","00:14:56,163",Precisely.
156,"00:14:56,165","00:14:58,842","And we believe that one of these
shop owners"
157,"00:14:58,948","00:15:00,583",is a master criminal.
158,"00:15:00,606","00:15:01,627",And that's where you come in.
159,"00:15:01,964","00:15:04,890","As an ex-villain,
you know how a villain thinks,"
160,"00:15:04,892","00:15:06,221",how a villain acts.
161,"00:15:06,400","00:15:08,411",The plan is to set you up undercover
162,"00:15:08,413","00:15:10,535","at a shop in the mall,
where hopefully you'll be able..."
163,"00:15:10,537","00:15:13,420","Ok, I see where this is going,"
164,"00:15:13,422","00:15:15,234",with all the Mission Impossible stuff.
165,"00:15:15,236","00:15:16,646",But no. No!
166,"00:15:16,761","00:15:20,556","I'm a father now.
And a legitimate businessman."
167,"00:15:20,666","00:15:24,349","I am developing a line
of delicious jams and jellies."
168,"00:15:26,074","00:15:27,508",Jams and jellies?
169,"00:15:28,663","00:15:30,697",Attitude! That's right!
170,"00:15:31,118","00:15:33,086","So, thanks, but no thanks."
171,"00:15:33,737","00:15:35,663",And here's a tip. Instead of...
172,"00:15:35,921","00:15:38,811","tasing people and kidnapping them,"
173,"00:15:38,835","00:15:41,383",maybe you should just give them a call!
174,"00:15:41,775","00:15:43,623","Good day, Mr. Sheepsbutt."
175,"00:15:43,848","00:15:44,964",Ramsbottom.
176,"00:15:45,123","00:15:46,966","Oh, yeah, like that's any better."
177,"00:16:00,972","00:16:03,405","Look, I probably
should not be saying this, but..."
178,"00:16:03,637","00:16:06,193","your work as a villain
was kind of amazing."
179,"00:16:06,545","00:16:10,151","So, if you ever wanna get back
to doing something awesome,"
180,"00:16:11,488","00:16:12,443",give us a call.
181,"00:16:18,050","00:16:18,980",Mack-oh!
182,"00:16:19,858","00:16:20,865",Mack-oh!
183,"00:16:21,373","00:16:22,529",Mack-oh!
184,"00:16:22,916","00:16:24,111",Mack-oh!
185,"00:16:24,603","00:16:25,681",Mack-oh!
186,"00:16:26,241","00:16:27,124",Mack-oh!
187,"00:16:32,393","00:16:34,872","Hey, I told you guys to get to bed."
188,"00:16:34,998","00:16:36,043","Oh, sorry."
189,"00:16:36,250","00:16:37,859","So, when you going on your date?"
190,"00:16:37,861","00:16:38,609",What?
191,"00:16:38,611","00:16:41,290","Remember, Miss Jillian said she
was arranging a date for you."
192,"00:16:41,328","00:16:45,509","Yeah, well, she is a nut job,
and I'm not going on any date."
193,"00:16:45,681","00:16:47,683",Why not? Are you scared?
194,"00:16:54,746","00:16:57,461","Hey, did you guys see
the moon landing on TV?"
195,"00:16:57,489","00:17:00,038","Yeah, I can't believe it.
It's so cool!"
196,"00:17:00,199","00:17:01,464","Yeah, and you know what.
Excuse me?"
197,"00:17:01,466","00:17:02,983","I was talking to Billy the other day.
Lisa?"
198,"00:17:03,036","00:17:04,082",No way!

402,"00:28:55,339","00:28:57,265","Come by if you get a chance, ok?"
403,"00:29:01,216","00:29:02,481","And welcome,"
404,"00:29:02,780","00:29:04,736",to the mall family.
405,"00:29:12,363","00:29:13,398",El Macho.
406,"00:29:14,237","00:29:14,911",What?
407,"00:29:15,122","00:29:16,293",But it couldn't be.
408,"00:29:16,351","00:29:17,716",What? What couldn't be?
409,"00:29:19,342","00:29:20,816","That guy looks,"
410,"00:29:20,982","00:29:24,462",exactly like a villain named El Macho.
411,"00:29:24,928","00:29:26,474",From about 20 years ago.
412,"00:29:32,735","00:29:33,982",He was ruthless!
413,"00:29:34,430","00:29:35,534",He was dangerous.
414,"00:29:35,942","00:29:37,815","And as the name implies,"
415,"00:29:38,277","00:29:39,704",very macho.
416,"00:29:49,990","00:29:51,368",He had a reputation
417,"00:29:51,491","00:29:55,209","for pulling off heists
using only his bare hands!"
418,"00:29:57,039","00:29:58,260","But sadly,"
419,"00:29:58,262","00:29:59,576","like all the greats,"
420,"00:29:59,578","00:30:02,138",El Macho was gone too soon.
421,"00:30:02,795","00:30:05,514",He died in the most macho way possible.
422,"00:30:05,852","00:30:07,342",Riding a shark
423,"00:30:07,549","00:30:11,847","with 250 pounds of dynamite
strapped to his chest"
424,"00:30:12,152","00:30:15,858",into the mouth of an active volcano!
425,"00:30:18,395","00:30:19,942",It was glorious.
426,"00:30:21,523","00:30:25,198","Yeah, sounds like
El Macho's pretty dead."
427,"00:30:25,318","00:30:27,742","They never found the body.
Oh, no."
428,"00:30:27,862","00:30:29,544","All that was ever retrieved,"
429,"00:30:30,038","00:30:33,040",was a pile of singed chest hair.
430,"00:30:33,560","00:30:34,674",But that face!
431,"00:30:35,120","00:30:36,948",It has got to be El Macho!
432,"00:30:37,331","00:30:40,184","Then what do you say you
and I break into his restaurant?"
433,"00:30:40,484","00:30:41,352",Tonight?
434,"00:30:41,532","00:30:42,714","Yes, that's good,"
435,"00:30:42,716","00:30:44,070","because I am telling you,"
436,"00:30:44,195","00:30:48,087","if anybody in this place
has the PX-41 serum,"
437,"00:30:48,968","00:30:50,199",it's him.
438,"00:30:53,189","00:30:55,061","Alright, alright, homework done,"
439,"00:30:55,063","00:30:57,228","pajamas on, teeth brushed,
time for bed."
440,"00:30:57,230","00:30:58,064",What's the big hurry?
441,"00:30:58,227","00:31:00,346",I just... I have a lot of work to do.
442,"00:31:00,362","00:31:02,152","Work, what kind of work?"
443,"00:31:02,231","00:31:03,949",Very important business.
444,"00:31:04,025","00:31:05,516","So, hugs, kisses."
445,"00:31:06,204","00:31:08,173","Good night, sleep tight,
don't let the bedbugs."
446,"00:31:08,175","00:31:09,315","Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah."
447,"00:31:09,995","00:31:11,586","But you said
you'd help me practice"
448,"00:31:11,594","00:31:13,688",my part for the Mother's Day Show.
449,"00:31:15,209","00:31:16,620","Fine, fine."
450,"00:31:16,622","00:31:18,298",Let me hear it. Quickly.
451,"00:31:18,900","00:31:22,353","She kisses my boo-boos,
she braids my hair."
452,"00:31:22,554","00:31:25,231",My mother is beyond compare.
453,"00:31:25,472","00:31:28,176",We love you mothers everywhere.
454,"00:31:29,647","00:31:31,762",That was something else.
455,"00:31:31,863","00:31:34,731","I really liked the way
you smiled at the end."
456,"00:31:35,138","00:31:37,022","Let's try this one more time,"
457,"00:31:37,024","00:31:39,242",but a teensy bit less...
458,"00:31:39,388","00:31:41,998","like a zombie, ok?"
459,"00:31:42,308","00:31:42,981",Ok.
460,"00:31:43,357","00:31:45,195","She kisses my boo-boos,"
461,"00:31:45,267","00:31:46,477",she braids my hair...
462,"00:31:46,485","00:31:47,749",Perfect! Time to go.
463,"00:31:48,439","00:31:50,408",I don't think I should do this.
464,"00:31:51,149","00:31:53,074","Well, what do you mean? Why not?"
465,"00:31:53,367","00:31:54,878",I don't even have a mom.
466,"00:31:56,245","00:31:58,741","Well, you don't need
one to do the show."
467,"00:31:58,743","00:31:59,435","I mean,"
468,"00:31:59,437","00:32:01,457",you did the veterans day pageant
469,"00:32:01,623","00:32:03,340",and you haven't been in combat.
470,"00:32:04,271","00:32:05,466",This is different.
471,"00:32:06,135","00:32:07,532","Ok, well,"
472,"00:32:07,534","00:32:10,654","then, maybe you can
just use your imagination."
473,"00:32:11,138","00:32:13,559","You mean, I pretend I have a mom?"
474,"00:32:13,679","00:32:15,201","Yes, right?"
475,"00:32:15,203","00:32:16,527","You can do that, can't you?"
476,"00:32:16,714","00:32:18,641",Yeah! I do that all the time.
477,"00:32:19,018","00:32:20,112","Thanks, Gru!"
478,"00:32:51,802","00:32:54,021","Alright. Hey, hey, no, no! No."
479,"00:32:54,023","00:32:56,151","Hey. Hey, please."
480,"00:32:56,679","00:32:57,846","Kevin, Jerry,"
481,"00:32:57,848","00:32:59,586","watch the girls for me, ok?"
482,"00:32:59,783","00:33:00,931","Dave, Stuart."
483,"00:33:00,933","00:33:02,936","Come this way!

484,"00:33:06,030","00:33:06,959",Come on!

493,"00:35:00,177","00:35:01,910",We're stealth ninjas.
494,"00:35:02,118","00:35:03,325",We make no sound.
495,"00:35:03,479","00:35:05,277",Right. Gotcha.
496,"00:35:10,403","00:35:11,920","Alright, El Macho."

498,"00:35:13,282","00:35:14,203",Wait! Wait.
499,"00:35:14,205","00:35:14,921",What?
500,"00:35:16,484","00:35:18,033",What are you doing?
501,"00:35:18,035","00:35:20,486","I'm checking
for laser beam alarm triggers."
502,"00:35:22,138","00:35:23,210",It's a restaurant!
503,"00:35:23,212","00:35:24,732","You never know what kind
of booby traps"
504,"00:35:24,734","00:35:25,691",this guy could have set.
505,"00:35:26,320","00:35:28,963","Come on.
There are no booby traps."
506,"00:35:30,367","00:35:31,406",Ha! Booby!
507,"00:35:43,222","00:35:44,238",There's a chicken.
508,"00:35:45,045","00:35:46,903","Are you lost, little guy?"
509,"00:35:47,336","00:35:48,947",You must be lost.
510,"00:35:49,771","00:35:51,119",Some guard dog.
511,"00:35:54,973","00:35:57,706","Get it off of me! Get it off of me!
Get it off of me!"
512,"00:36:05,293","00:36:06,295",I got you!
513,"00:36:12,483","00:36:13,331",I got it!
514,"00:36:33,104","00:36:34,528",What is wrong with that chicken?
515,"00:36:35,819","00:36:38,645","Hey, that pollo es loco."
516,"00:36:40,379","00:36:40,976",No?
517,"00:36:41,747","00:36:42,739","Ok, let's go."
518,"00:36:50,254","00:36:51,973",You getting anything?
519,"00:36:52,049","00:36:53,595","No, not yet."
520,"00:36:53,676","00:36:57,593","But, hey, maybe you can find
something with these X-ray goggles."
521,"00:37:05,562","00:37:07,277","How are they working?
Tell me! Tell me!"
522,"00:37:09,149","00:37:10,555","What's wrong?
Is something wrong?"
523,"00:37:11,013","00:37:13,623","That's an image I'll never
get out of my brain. Blech"
524,"00:37:23,187","00:37:24,131",I knew it!
525,"00:37:24,689","00:37:26,134",The serum is in here!
526,"00:37:26,208","00:37:27,461",Then let's get it.
527,"00:37:29,755","00:37:31,644",This is going to be good!
528,"00:37:38,980","00:37:39,712",What?
529,"00:37:41,809","00:37:43,151",Salsa?
530,"00:37:43,574","00:37:44,573",Oh man.

534,"00:38:03,083","00:38:04,666",Pollito? Can you hear me?
535,"00:38:05,798","00:38:08,919","Who would do this to such
a sweet little chicken.'?"
536,"00:38:09,002","00:38:10,926",What? Who's there?
537,"00:38:12,777","00:38:14,745","You coming out?
Or am I gonna go in?"
538,"00:38:25,181","00:38:25,927",Stop!

573,"00:41:34,745","00:41:36,556","Well, we thought
we'd come visit you at work."
574,"00:41:36,958","00:41:39,389","So, you're saving the world
in a garbage can?"
575,"00:41:41,349","00:41:42,691","Funny.
Hey!"
576,"00:41:42,887","00:41:43,866",There you are.

587,"00:42:11,192","00:42:13,668","why don't you girls go
and explore the mall?"
588,"00:42:13,932","00:42:16,766","Here is some money,
go buy some useless mall junk."
589,"00:42:16,923","00:42:18,420","Some headbands,"

that the son is involved, too."

731,"00:49:49,088","00:49:49,793","But,"
732,"00:49:49,912","00:49:53,225","on the less♪♪crazy side of things,"
733,"00:49:54,093","00:49:57,088","Gru discovered traces of the
serum at Eagle Hair Club!"
734,"00:49:57,992","00:49:59,028",Interesting.
735,"00:49:59,205","00:50:01,059","Yeah! And you know who
made that happen?"
736,"00:50:01,666","00:50:02,668",This guy.
737,"00:50:02,670","00:50:04,925","Nailed it. Amazing, right?"
738,"00:50:04,927","00:50:06,184","No, I mean, sure."
739,"00:50:06,186","00:50:08,776","But it's not him, it is El Macho!"
740,"00:50:08,778","00:50:10,672","Mr. Gru, please!"
741,"00:50:10,674","00:50:13,517",No! It is him and I will prove it!
742,"00:50:15,081","00:50:16,789","Gru, come on!"
743,"00:50:20,111","00:50:21,844",He really thinks it's El Macho.
744,"00:50:22,924","00:50:24,044",Can you tell?

of vacation days you guys get."
754,"00:51:50,340","00:51:52,364",I can't find anybody anymore.
755,"00:51:53,449","00:51:55,544","Gru, it's Jillian!"
756,"00:51:56,436","00:51:58,358",I've got good news!

763,"00:52:09,814","00:52:12,338","Agnes, tell Jillian I'm not here."
764,"00:52:13,163","00:52:14,375",Gru's not here.
765,"00:52:14,615","00:52:16,286",Are you sure?
766,"00:52:16,416","00:52:17,884","Yes, he just told me!"
767,"00:52:20,419","00:52:22,467","I mean, no, he didn't just tell me."
768,"00:52:23,588","00:52:25,674","Agnes, where is Gru?"
769,"00:52:27,051","00:52:28,799",He's putting on lipstick!

799,"00:54:01,196","00:54:01,931",What?
800,"00:54:02,887","00:54:04,074",I don't think so.
801,"00:54:04,087","00:54:05,173",I knew it.
802,"00:54:05,443","00:54:06,653",You're a phony.
803,"00:54:06,655","00:54:07,708",I hate phonies!
804,"00:54:07,710","00:54:09,983","Oh, what?
No. These locks are all mine."
805,"00:54:09,985","00:54:11,187","No, they're not!"
806,"00:54:11,324","00:54:12,747",You know what I'm gonna do?
807,"00:54:12,749","00:54:14,533","I'm gonna rip that thing off your head,"
808,"00:54:14,535","00:54:15,760",and show everyone what a
809,"00:54:15,762","00:54:17,585",bald-headed phony you are.
810,"00:54:17,644","00:54:18,994","I don't think so, miss lady."
811,"00:54:28,610","00:54:29,414",Hello?
812,"00:54:29,990","00:54:30,915",Hello?
813,"00:54:31,119","00:54:32,593","Are you...
Hey, Gru"
814,"00:54:32,664","00:54:34,451","Hello, Lucy."
815,"00:54:34,453","00:54:35,767",How are you doing?
816,"00:54:36,303","00:54:38,065","Looks like your
date's out for the count."
817,"00:54:38,268","00:54:41,078","It's like she's been shot with
a mild moose tranquilizer."
818,"00:54:47,152","00:54:49,718","Yeah, I'm winking because
that's what actually happened."
819,"00:54:50,072","00:54:50,976","'Scusi,"
820,"00:54:50,978","00:54:52,301",whassa happening here?
821,"00:54:52,303","00:54:53,194",She no like?
822,"00:54:53,267","00:54:54,734","Oh, she's just..."
823,"00:54:57,457","00:54:58,440","Si, si."
824,"00:54:59,883","00:55:01,003",Shall we take her home?
825,"00:55:43,460","00:55:45,112","Well, I think you did it."
826,"00:55:45,114","00:55:46,931","You just officially
had the worst date ever."
827,"00:55:47,686","00:55:48,773",Tell me about it.
828,"00:55:49,069","00:55:50,030",Don't worry.
829,"00:55:50,300","00:55:52,065","It can only get better from here, right?"
830,"00:55:52,382","00:55:54,389","But if it doesn't, you can
always borrow my dart gun."
831,"00:55:54,471","00:55:56,764","I've had to use it on
one or two dates myself."
832,"00:55:56,974","00:55:59,194","Yeah, you know, as far as dates go,"
833,"00:55:59,268","00:56:01,612",I think I'm good with just the one.
834,"00:56:05,482","00:56:06,371","Well,"
835,"00:56:07,154","00:56:08,286","good night, partner."
836,"00:56:10,821","00:56:11,868",This was fun.
837,"00:56:12,155","00:56:14,448","Yes. Surprisingly, it was."
838,"00:56:15,493","00:56:16,453","Oh, and..."
839,"00:56:16,697","00:56:17,962",just between you and me?
840,"00:56:18,694","00:56:20,097",You look much better bald.
841,"00:56:23,021","00:56:23,915",See you tomorrow.
842,"00:56:42,028","00:56:43,525","So, I take it the date went well?"
843,"00:56:43,690","00:56:45,298","No, it was horrible."
844,"00:56:56,819","00:56:57,655",Hey buddy!
845,"00:57:43,535","00:57:45,335",Mr. Ramsbottom?
846,"00:57:45,517","00:57:46,594","Oh, hello."
847,"00:57:46,862","00:57:48,134",What are you doing here?
848,"00:57:48,214","00:57:49,293",We got him.
849,"00:57:49,295","00:57:50,137",Got who?
850,"00:57:50,439","00:57:51,800",Floyd Eaglesan!
851,"00:57:52,050","00:57:55,123","Our agents located a secret
room in his shop last night"
852,"00:57:55,131","00:57:56,824",and discovered this.
853,"00:57:56,930","00:58:01,061","It's empty, but we found traces
of the PX-41 serum in it."
854,"00:58:01,415","00:58:02,457",He's our man.
855,"00:58:02,687","00:58:05,486","So, somehow,
in spite of your incompetence,"
856,"00:58:05,488","00:58:07,069",we solved this one.
857,"00:58:07,192","00:58:08,399",I was framed!
858,"00:58:08,818","00:58:10,411",You won't get away with this!
859,"00:58:10,485","00:58:11,938",Get your mitts off of me!
860,"00:58:12,314","00:58:14,312",I am a legitimate businessman.
861,"00:58:14,314","00:58:16,871",Alright. So what now?
862,"00:58:16,950","00:58:20,069","Well, now you're free to
go back to your business."
863,"00:58:21,094","00:58:22,510",Jams and jellies.
864,"00:58:22,900","00:58:24,749",And it looks like agent Wilde will be
865,"00:58:24,751","00:58:26,891",transferring to our Australian branch.
866,"00:58:27,672","00:58:28,637",Australia?
867,"00:58:28,913","00:58:29,705",Yes.
868,"00:58:30,090","00:58:31,660",But thank you for everything.
869,"00:58:31,842","00:58:34,315","And by everything,
of course I mean, nothing."
870,"00:58:34,992","00:58:36,926","Toodle pip and cheerio, Mr. Gru"
871,"00:58:41,991","00:58:42,870","Hey, there."
872,"00:58:43,140","00:58:43,813",Hey.
873,"00:58:44,253","00:58:45,480","So, we got him."
874,"00:58:45,647","00:58:47,013",Yeah.
875,"00:58:47,015","00:58:48,156",That's great.
876,"00:58:48,822","00:58:50,619",And now you're going to Australia?
877,"00:58:50,777","00:58:52,348","Well, it's not definite yet."
878,"00:58:52,350","00:58:53,532",I'm still figuring it out.
879,"00:58:53,940","00:58:55,348","I've already been
working on my accent."
880,"00:58:55,825","00:58:56,706",Wallaby.
881,"00:58:56,708","00:58:57,999",Diggeri-doo.
882,"00:58:58,118","00:58:59,496",Hugh Jackman.
883,"00:59:01,383","00:59:02,124",So...
884,"00:59:03,510","00:59:04,760",pretty excited.
885,"00:59:05,767","00:59:06,470",Great.
886,"00:59:07,169","00:59:07,848","Well,"
887,"00:59:08,387","00:59:09,261",good luck.
888,"00:59:09,714","00:59:10,402",Thanks.
889,"00:59:10,911","00:59:11,714","You, too."
890,"00:59:14,039","00:59:15,808","Here.
I wanted to give you this."
891,"00:59:16,464","00:59:17,906",Your lipstick taser?
892,"00:59:18,082","00:59:19,812","Yeah, it's just a memento."
893,"00:59:19,890","00:59:20,801","Just,"
894,"00:59:20,961","00:59:21,829","you know,"
895,"00:59:21,831","00:59:23,742",from the first time we met.
896,"00:59:25,126","00:59:26,319","Thank you, Lucy."
897,"00:59:27,266","00:59:28,236",Agent Wilde.
898,"00:59:29,377","00:59:31,475","Well, it looks like they need you."
899,"00:59:31,558","00:59:32,319",So...
900,"00:59:32,520","00:59:33,717","Yeah, I..."
901,"00:59:33,899","00:59:34,714",better go.
902,"00:59:36,293","00:59:37,252","Bye, Gru"
903,"01:00:14,227","01:00:15,736",I brought you an umbrella.
904,"01:00:20,498","01:00:21,088",Thank you.
905,"01:00:21,141","01:00:22,370",What are you doing out here?
906,"01:00:23,491","01:00:27,215","Remember when you said that
I liked Lucy?"
907,"01:00:28,231","01:00:28,907","Well,"
908,"01:00:29,892","01:00:31,011","it turns out,"
909,"01:00:31,594","01:00:32,388",you're right.
910,"01:00:33,341","01:00:34,142",Really?
911,"01:00:34,509","01:00:35,784","Yes, but..."
912,"01:00:36,551","01:00:38,212","Well, she's moving away."
913,"01:00:39,221","01:00:41,086",I'm never going to see her again.
914,"01:00:45,520","01:00:47,492",Is there anything I could do to help?
915,"01:00:48,188","01:00:49,407",I don't...
916,"01:00:50,125","01:00:51,945","I don't think so, sweetheart."
917,"01:00:53,097","01:00:55,154","Well, is there anything you could do?"
918,"01:00:57,313","01:00:59,360","Hello, Lucy. This is Gru"
919,"01:00:59,910","01:01:02,904",I know up to this point our relationship
920,"01:01:02,906","01:01:04,994","has been strictly professional,"
921,"01:01:05,696","01:01:08,594","and you're leaving for Australia and all,"
922,"01:01:08,596","01:01:09,491",but...
923,"01:01:10,213","01:01:12,670","ok, here is the question."
924,"01:01:13,291","01:01:14,756",Would you like to...
925,"01:01:16,398","01:01:18,420",To go out on a date?
926,"01:01:20,927","01:01:21,753",No.
927,"01:01:22,210","01:01:23,687","Ok, that's not helping."
928,"01:01:24,101","01:01:25,506","Alright, here we go."
929,"01:01:25,508","01:01:27,072",For real this time.
930,"01:01:36,990","01:01:38,124",I can do this.
931,"01:01:57,613","01:01:58,464",I hate you!
932,"01:02:10,841","01:02:15,332",Beedo! Beedo! Beedo! Beedo!
933,"01:02:22,425","01:02:25,472",Beedo! Beedo! Beedo! Bee...
934,"01:02:28,398","01:02:30,329",Beedo! Beedo!
935,"01:03:00,957","01:03:01,706",Kevin?
936,"01:03:03,002","01:03:03,611",Tom?
937,"01:03:04,171","01:03:05,331",Bello! Compai.
938,"01:03:05,540","01:03:06,939","Compai!
Compai!"
939,"01:03:07,787","01:03:08,700",Compai!
940,"01:03:29,022","01:03:32,242","Cinco de May-ya-yo!
Cinco de May-ya-yo!"
941,"01:03:42,527","01:03:44,310",This place is awesome!
942,"01:03:47,248","01:03:48,702",Ok. Let's party?
943,"01:03:49,265","01:03:52,032","But first, let's go over the rules."
944,"01:03:52,118","01:03:55,174",Because what is fun without the rules?
945,"01:03:55,184","01:03:57,038","Agnes, easy on the churros."
946,"01:03:57,329","01:03:59,473","Edith, try not to kill anyone.
Hai!"
947,"01:03:59,636","01:04:00,682",Margo!
948,"01:04:00,763","01:04:01,888","Hello, Mr. Gru"
949,"01:04:02,979","01:04:03,548",Ok.
950,"01:04:04,363","01:04:04,979",Gru!
951,"01:04:05,598","01:04:10,027","There must be the standard 6 feet
of space between you and boys."
952,"01:04:10,147","01:04:12,003",Especially this boy.
953,"01:04:13,476","01:04:14,978",You are a funny man.
954,"01:04:15,308","01:04:16,982","There are no rules, senor."
955,"01:04:16,984","01:04:18,258",It's cinco de Mayo.
956,"01:04:18,413","01:04:20,057","Come on!
They're starting the dance!"
957,"01:04:20,440","01:04:22,661",Arriba!
958,"01:05:19,668","01:05:22,811","So glad you could make it,
mi compadre."
959,"01:05:24,263","01:05:25,433","Hey, what's wrong?"
960,"01:05:25,435","01:05:27,554",Nothing. Nothing is wrong.
961,"01:05:27,643","01:05:29,814","I'm just chilling with the guac,"
962,"01:05:30,792","01:05:32,088",from my chip hat.
963,"01:05:35,109","01:05:36,239","Gru, please."
964,"01:05:36,411","01:05:38,560",I know that look all too well.
965,"01:05:38,737","01:05:40,816",It is the look of a broken heart.
966,"01:05:41,456","01:05:42,454",How did you know?
967,"01:05:42,701","01:05:44,162","Believe me, my friend,"
968,"01:05:44,164","01:05:46,171",I too have spent many nights
969,"01:05:46,343","01:05:49,921","trying to drown my sorrows
in guacamole."
970,"01:05:50,441","01:05:51,192",You?
971,"01:05:51,467","01:05:52,268",Yes.
972,"01:05:53,422","01:05:54,204",But...
973,"01:05:54,206","01:05:55,677",we are survivors.
974,"01:05:56,366","01:05:58,363",There's much more to us
975,"01:05:58,365","01:05:59,748",than meets the eye.
976,"01:06:01,315","01:06:02,620",Enjoy the party.
977,"01:06:53,527","01:06:55,286",What the?
978,"01:07:42,032","01:07:43,327",Say what?
979,"01:07:56,496","01:07:58,704","Would you like some peanuts
or pretzels?"
980,"01:08:03,886","01:08:05,764",That's a good joke.
981,"01:08:09,892","01:08:11,956",I just did a boom boom.
982,"01:08:13,957","01:08:16,085","I really need you to make a choice, hon."
983,"01:08:17,525","01:08:18,749",I choose Gru.
984,"01:08:19,819","01:08:21,867",I choose Gru!
985,"01:08:25,575","01:08:27,624","Thank you, Gru stewardess!"
986,"01:08:27,703","01:08:29,376",You're welcome!
987,"01:09:02,881","01:09:05,947","You have not lost your touch, my friend."
988,"01:09:07,552","01:09:08,792",I knew it!
989,"01:09:09,074","01:09:10,620",You are El Macho!
990,"01:09:10,622","01:09:12,613",That's right!
991,"01:09:12,940","01:09:14,412",Nobody believed me!
992,"01:09:14,414","01:09:16,657",But I knew you weren't dead!
993,"01:09:17,754","01:09:19,045",Of course not.
994,"01:09:19,047","01:09:21,008",I merely faked my death.
995,"01:09:22,217","01:09:24,483","But now, it's time for me"
996,"01:09:24,501","01:09:28,471",to make a spectacular return to evil.
997,"01:09:28,974","01:09:29,847","Doctor,"
998,"01:09:29,849","01:09:31,544","I think it's time,"
999,"01:09:31,546","01:09:33,011","we showed Gru,"
1000,"01:09:33,013","01:09:34,359",what we're up to here.
1001,"01:09:34,573","01:09:36,367",Dr. Nefario?
1002,"01:09:36,565","01:09:38,493","Nice to see you, Gru"
1003,"01:09:39,402","01:09:40,606",What?
1004,"01:09:40,608","01:09:43,476","So, this is your new job opportunity?"
1005,"01:09:43,614","01:09:45,059",Absolutely.
1006,"01:09:45,061","01:09:46,584",You're gonna like this.
1007,"01:09:51,731","01:09:52,858",Sorry.
1008,"01:09:52,874","01:09:54,767","I had to borrow some of your minions,"
1009,"01:09:54,769","01:09:56,630",but it was for a worthy cause.
1010,"01:09:57,981","01:09:58,969",Kevin!
1011,"01:09:59,798","01:10:02,300","No, he's not Kevin anymore."
1012,"01:10:02,466","01:10:05,479","Now he is an indestructible,"
1013,"01:10:05,481","01:10:07,726",mindless killing machine!
1014,"01:10:08,839","01:10:10,863",Just watch this.
1015,"01:10:25,282","01:10:27,159",And here's the best part!
1016,"01:10:27,461","01:10:30,504",I got an army of them!
1017,"01:10:32,230","01:10:34,174","Look, look, look!"
1018,"01:10:43,331","01:10:46,721","Soon I will unleash them on the world,"
1019,"01:10:47,221","01:10:48,416","and if anyone,"
1020,"01:10:48,418","01:10:51,155",anyone tries to stop them...
1021,"01:10:52,804","01:10:54,732",Their city gets eaten!
1022,"01:10:55,730","01:10:57,232",We can do it together.
1023,"01:10:57,651","01:10:58,528",Together?
1024,"01:10:58,649","01:10:59,695",Together!
1025,"01:11:00,319","01:11:02,926","I have admired your work
for years, amigo."
1026,"01:11:03,379","01:11:05,180",Stealing the moon!
1027,"01:11:05,182","01:11:06,534",Are you kidding?
1028,"01:11:06,657","01:11:08,956",We would be unstoppable!
1029,"01:11:09,269","01:11:11,709","Men like you, men like me."
1030,"01:11:11,788","01:11:15,381",We should be ruling the world!
1031,"01:11:16,211","01:11:17,393","So, are you in?"
1032,"01:11:19,880","01:11:21,845","Yeah, probably."
1033,"01:11:22,299","01:11:23,391",Probably?
1034,"01:11:23,509","01:11:26,294","I mean, yes, yes!
Of course, yes."
1035,"01:11:26,296","01:11:28,962",I just have a lot going on right now.
1036,"01:11:29,097","01:11:31,851","I just need to get
some things off my plate"
1037,"01:11:32,078","01:11:35,234","before we start taking over the world,
that's all."
1038,"01:11:35,354","01:11:37,230","'Scuse me?
No. No, forget it."
1039,"01:11:37,564","01:11:40,417",One hundred percent! I am in!
1040,"01:11:40,735","01:11:43,784","I think... what is...
Do you hear that? I do."
1041,"01:11:43,904","01:11:47,580","That's Agnes calling me
from on the surface."
1042,"01:11:50,411","01:11:51,520",Totally in!
1043,"01:11:53,747","01:11:54,920",You know what?
1044,"01:11:55,041","01:11:57,590",I am not so convinced that he is in.
1045,"01:12:09,389","01:12:10,718","Edith, Agnes, come on!"
1046,"01:12:12,177","01:12:12,694",Sorry.
1047,"01:12:12,696","01:12:14,547","We need to go home now.
Where is Margo?"
1048,"01:12:14,549","01:12:16,022",But I didn't get a turn!
1049,"01:12:22,994","01:12:23,983",Margo!
1050,"01:12:24,263","01:12:25,543",Come on. We're lea...
1051,"01:12:26,490","01:12:27,677","Hey, what's wrong?"
1052,"01:12:28,116","01:12:29,448",I hate boys.
1053,"01:12:32,871","01:12:34,641",Yes. They stink.
1054,"01:12:35,093","01:12:37,078","Sorry. Honey, we got to go."
1055,"01:13:01,152","01:13:02,022",Sorry.
1056,"01:13:13,384","01:13:16,295","Hey! Pollito, what's the matter?"
1057,"01:13:16,509","01:13:17,427","Hey, Eduardo!"
1058,"01:13:17,450","01:13:19,555","Lucia, I apologize."
1059,"01:13:19,557","01:13:22,309","Pollito, he's usually not like this."
1060,"01:13:22,339","01:13:23,947","The same thing happened,"
1061,"01:13:23,949","01:13:25,255",the other day with...
1062,"01:13:25,803","01:13:27,170",with Gru and...
1063,"01:13:29,572","01:13:30,980","Well, speaking of Gru..."
1064,"01:13:30,982","01:13:32,263",have you seen him?
1065,"01:13:32,265","01:13:33,611",I really need to talk to him.
1066,"01:13:33,683","01:13:34,482",Yes.
1067,"01:13:34,484","01:13:36,573",I think he's somewhere around here.
1068,"01:13:36,937","01:13:38,780","You two are close, no?"
1069,"01:13:39,377","01:13:40,525",I don't know.
1070,"01:13:40,609","01:13:42,281","I mean, close,"
1071,"01:13:42,283","01:13:43,953",I would not say we were close.
1072,"01:13:44,344","01:13:46,029","Why, did he say we were close?
Did he say that?"
1073,"01:13:46,113","01:13:48,434",It's more what he didn't say.
1074,"01:13:48,699","01:13:50,144","For instance,"
1075,"01:13:50,535","01:13:52,045","he never mentioned,"
1076,"01:13:52,119","01:13:55,248","that you were both working
for the Anti-Villain League!"
1077,"01:13:56,457","01:13:57,972",You're coming with me.
1078,"01:13:58,209","01:13:58,918",Hey!
1079,"01:14:00,544","01:14:01,508",Crikey!
1080,"01:14:08,173","01:14:10,642","So, Eduardo's actually El Macho?"
1081,"01:14:10,957","01:14:11,772",Cool!
1082,"01:14:11,774","01:14:13,117","No, it is not cool!"
1083,"01:14:13,266","01:14:15,644","Plus, I pretty much knew
it was him all along,"
1084,"01:14:15,727","01:14:17,729","so if anyone's cool, it's me!"
1085,"01:14:19,731","01:14:20,778",Gru!
1086,"01:14:20,899","01:14:22,947","Well, Dr. Nefario."
1087,"01:14:23,068","01:14:23,964",El Macho's onto you.
1088,"01:14:23,995","01:14:25,822",He knows you're working for the A.V.I.
1089,"01:14:25,904","01:14:27,872",And he's got your partner.
1090,"01:14:28,407","01:14:29,154",Lucy?
1091,"01:14:29,908","01:14:33,127","That's impossible.
She's on her way to Australia!"
1092,"01:14:33,401","01:14:34,031",Nefario?
1093,"01:14:34,085","01:14:35,336","Sorry, got to go!"
1094,"01:14:37,540","01:14:38,884",He's got Lucy?
1095,"01:14:40,002","01:14:41,336",Not for long.
1096,"01:14:41,884","01:14:44,026","Come on, we're getting her out of there."
1097,"01:15:52,301","01:15:53,332",Oh patii.
1098,"01:16:12,846","01:16:13,838",What was that?
1099,"01:16:25,902","01:16:27,199",I don't see anything.
1100,"01:16:41,376","01:16:42,137",Run!
1101,"01:16:42,920","01:16:43,921",My unicorn!
1102,"01:16:44,045","01:16:45,110","Agnes, no!"
1103,"01:17:06,593","01:17:07,648",Ee patii
1104,"01:17:08,299","01:17:09,067",Patii!
1105,"01:17:19,415","01:17:21,293",Come on! Hurry!
1106,"01:17:24,587","01:17:25,840",What's the matter?
1107,"01:17:43,006","01:17:44,007",Oh la la!
1108,"01:17:45,379","01:17:46,265",Pilatos?
1109,"01:17:47,145","01:17:47,873",Kevin!
1110,"01:17:50,864","01:17:52,646",Dr. Nefario! You're back!
1111,"01:17:52,988","01:17:54,151",In the flesh.
1112,"01:17:55,429","01:17:56,529","Behold,"
1113,"01:17:56,851","01:17:58,193",the antidote.
1114,"01:18:01,120","01:18:02,032",Come on.
1115,"01:18:02,160","01:18:04,883","Let's finally put this horrible jelly
to some good use."
1116,"01:18:20,048","01:18:22,751","Hey, guys, come on!
Stay focused here."
1117,"01:18:23,149","01:18:24,210","Ok, ok."
1118,"01:18:41,070","01:18:42,092",Pulati ka mas a ra?
1119,"01:18:44,137","01:18:44,848",Mas a ra?
1120,"01:19:02,532","01:19:03,250",Ola!
1121,"01:19:05,024","01:19:06,247",Curses!
1122,"01:19:06,249","01:19:07,574",Foiled again!
1123,"01:19:07,734","01:19:10,237",These guys captured me!
1124,"01:19:44,906","01:19:45,644",No?
1125,"01:19:49,088","01:19:50,215",Run!
1126,"01:19:59,478","01:20:00,593",Up that tree!
1127,"01:20:01,748","01:20:02,875",Hurry! Hurry!
1128,"01:21:03,938","01:21:05,736","Hello, Gru!"
1129,"01:21:05,756","01:21:09,055","Hey hey! Nice work, Dr. Nefario!"
1130,"01:21:09,436","01:21:11,430",I put an antidote in the jelly.
1131,"01:21:12,028","01:21:15,909","I mean, I'm happy to create an
evil army to destroy the world,"
1132,"01:21:15,991","01:21:18,494",but nobody messes with my family.
1133,"01:21:18,869","01:21:20,276","Thank you, doctor."
1134,"01:21:20,996","01:21:22,853","Now, let's go get the..."
1135,"01:21:24,311","01:21:25,113",Hi!
1136,"01:21:25,603","01:21:27,178",You brought the girls?
1137,"01:21:27,529","01:21:28,220",Yes!
1138,"01:21:29,938","01:21:30,879",Was that wrong?
1139,"01:21:41,183","01:21:43,653",What's happening to my minions?
1140,"01:21:44,028","01:21:44,808",Gru?
1141,"01:21:46,940","01:21:49,516","You guys, take care of the rest
of the minions."
1142,"01:21:49,693","01:21:51,495",I'm going to find Lucy.
1143,"01:22:02,114","01:22:04,633","Eat jelly, you purple freaks!"
1144,"01:22:33,946","01:22:35,699","It's over, El Macho."
1145,"01:22:35,823","01:22:37,121","Now, where is Lucy?"
1146,"01:22:38,611","01:22:39,907",Let me show you.
1147,"01:22:52,423","01:22:53,891","Oh, hey, Gru!"
1148,"01:22:53,966","01:22:57,049","Turns out you were right about
the whole El Macho thing?"
1149,"01:22:59,515","01:23:01,223","One push of this button,"
1150,"01:23:01,225","01:23:03,020",and I send that rocket
1151,"01:23:03,254","01:23:05,806",straight into the same volcano
1152,"01:23:05,808","01:23:07,482",where I faked my death.
1153,"01:23:07,606","01:23:09,079","Only this time,"
1154,"01:23:09,081","01:23:10,531",it's for real.
1155,"01:23:10,609","01:23:11,396",No!
1156,"01:23:13,638","01:23:14,779",Tallyho!
1157,"01:23:22,261","01:23:25,480","We could have ruled
the world together, Gru!"
1158,"01:23:26,270","01:23:27,323","But now,"
1159,"01:23:28,148","01:23:29,360",you're gonna die.
1160,"01:24:42,188","01:24:44,639",Lipstick taser!
1161,"01:24:45,906","01:24:46,962",He copied me.
1162,"01:24:53,382","01:24:55,655",I am not afraid...
1163,"01:24:55,996","01:24:57,513",of your jelly guns.
1164,"01:24:57,845","01:25:00,455","Oh, this ain't a jelly gun, sunshine."
1165,"01:25:15,416","01:25:17,373","Don't worry about me, Gru, I'll be fine."
1166,"01:25:17,448","01:25:19,917",I have survived lots worse than this.
1167,"01:25:19,992","01:25:21,570","Ok, that's not entirely true."
1168,"01:25:21,572","01:25:23,353",I'm actually kind of freaking out up here!
1169,"01:25:23,627","01:25:25,715","Don't worry, I will get you out of this."
1170,"01:25:34,256","01:25:36,119",I really hate that chicken.
1171,"01:26:01,726","01:26:03,730","Is there a red one?
It's usually the red one!"
1172,"01:26:06,164","01:26:08,658","Gru, anytime now!"
1173,"01:26:10,544","01:26:13,263","Listen, Lucy, we may not
get out of this alive,"
1174,"01:26:13,339","01:26:15,209",so I need to ask you a question.
1175,"01:26:15,676","01:26:16,880",Better make it quick.
1176,"01:26:17,501","01:26:19,425","If I had asked you out on a date,"
1177,"01:26:19,427","01:26:20,681",what would you have said?
1178,"01:26:21,220","01:26:22,391",Are you kidding me?
1179,"01:26:22,473","01:26:23,356",Yes!
1180,"01:26:25,917","01:26:26,914",Jump!
1181,"01:26:39,574","01:26:41,042",Lucy!
1182,"01:26:41,701","01:26:43,535","Lucy, where are you?"
1183,"01:26:47,009","01:26:48,225","Oh, Lucy!"
1184,"01:26:49,167","01:26:50,021",Gru!
1185,"01:26:54,338","01:26:57,906","Sorry! I guess you need your arms
to tread water?"
1186,"01:26:59,615","01:27:00,615",Mack-oh!
1187,"01:27:01,473","01:27:02,507",Mack-oh!
