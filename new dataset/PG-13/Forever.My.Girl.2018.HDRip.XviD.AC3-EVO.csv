where Liam Page is, yeah."
380,"00:21:15,972","00:21:17,806",Have you turned on a TV?
381,"00:21:17,808","00:21:21,110","Does that prehistoric cellphone
of yours even have Wi-Fi?"
382,"00:21:21,112","00:21:24,979","I'm in my hometown
right now, in Louisiana."
383,"00:21:24,981","00:21:26,882","My best friend
from high school passed away."
384,"00:21:26,884","00:21:28,185",I just went to his funeral.
385,"00:21:32,022","00:21:35,123","Liam, I'm so sorry, man,
I mean, are you all right?"
386,"00:21:35,125","00:21:37,625","- Yeah, I think so.
- Okay. Well,"
387,"00:21:37,627","00:21:39,394","I just want you to know
I'm going to get everything set"
388,"00:21:39,396","00:21:40,796","on this end, all right?"
389,"00:21:40,798","00:21:43,798","I mean, that was your last
concert date on that tour,"
390,"00:21:43,800","00:21:45,367",so we'll just set Denver up
391,"00:21:45,369","00:21:46,768","after we go to Europe
on the next tour."
392,"00:21:46,770","00:21:48,136",It's all going to be fine.
393,"00:21:48,138","00:21:50,472","You just... you just be
with your friends"
394,"00:21:50,474","00:21:51,806",and your family.
395,"00:21:51,808","00:21:53,476","And look, and Doris, I mean,"
396,"00:21:53,478","00:21:55,076","Doris started spinning
some crazy story"
397,"00:21:55,078","00:21:56,711","about why you missed
that concert."
398,"00:21:56,713","00:21:58,646","So don't even worry
about it, all right?"
399,"00:21:58,648","00:22:01,116","Hey, Sam,"
400,"00:22:01,118","00:22:02,450",where are my credit cards?
401,"00:22:02,452","00:22:04,652","Why? I mean,"
402,"00:22:04,654","00:22:07,390","I've never seen you use your
credit cards by yourself before."
403,"00:22:07,392","00:22:11,994","I just... I want to buy
a few things, that's all."
404,"00:22:11,996","00:22:13,996","All I have is the cash
in my pocket."
405,"00:22:13,998","00:22:15,998","Okay. All right.
Yeah, I'll overnight them."
406,"00:22:16,000","00:22:17,900","Thanks, Sam. All right."
407,"00:22:17,902","00:22:19,134",Can I get a car?
408,"00:22:19,136","00:22:20,669","Just text me
your address."
409,"00:22:20,671","00:22:22,771","Now speaking of crazy,
there's Doris."
410,"00:22:22,773","00:22:24,842","All right, I got to go, brother,
all right. We'll talk soon."
411,"00:22:29,713","00:22:31,881",Bike it is.
412,"00:22:46,963","00:22:48,764","Twenty,
and there you go."
413,"00:22:48,766","00:22:50,432","- Thank you very much.
- Thank you, sir."
414,"00:22:50,434","00:22:51,801",Have a good day.
415,"00:22:51,803","00:22:53,505","- How are you?
- Good."
416,"00:22:55,673","00:22:58,207","- We have more in the back.
- Excuse me?"
417,"00:22:58,209","00:23:00,809","More magazines
with your face on them."
418,"00:23:00,811","00:23:03,645","Do you want me
to get those for you?"
419,"00:23:03,647","00:23:05,951","No, I'm good, thanks."
420,"00:23:07,518","00:23:10,154","Lydia. We went
to high school together."
421,"00:23:12,088","00:23:13,125",Right.
422,"00:23:15,460","00:23:17,793","24.99, please."
423,"00:23:17,795","00:23:19,194","So, Lydia,"
424,"00:23:19,196","00:23:22,530","you don't happen to know
where Josie lives, do you?"
425,"00:23:22,532","00:23:23,865",No.
426,"00:23:23,867","00:23:25,633",Or where she works?
427,"00:23:25,635","00:23:27,670","Thanks for shopping
at Ed's."
428,"00:24:02,138","00:24:04,206",Here you go.
429,"00:24:04,208","00:24:06,141","That will be 8.69,
Mrs. Boudreaux."
430,"00:24:06,143","00:24:07,676",Okay.
431,"00:24:07,678","00:24:09,545","Oh, Judy, could you pop
into the back and tuck"
432,"00:24:09,547","00:24:11,145","that arrangement
for Ms. LeBlanc for me?"
433,"00:24:11,147","00:24:13,015","She's going to come by
this afternoon to pick it up."
434,"00:24:13,017","00:24:14,616","- Sure.
- Thank you."
435,"00:24:14,618","00:24:15,886",Ten...
436,"00:24:18,221","00:24:19,723",twenty...
437,"00:24:20,790","00:24:22,660",thirty...
438,"00:24:24,795","00:24:26,064",forty...
439,"00:24:27,664","00:24:29,131",fifty...
440,"00:24:29,133","00:24:31,834","- Hi.
- I'm with a customer."
441,"00:24:31,836","00:24:33,869",...sixty.
442,"00:24:33,871","00:24:35,237","You know, this is such"
443,"00:24:35,239","00:24:36,838","a pretty prayer plant,
Mrs. Boudreaux."
444,"00:24:36,840","00:24:38,774","I think you picked out
the best one I have."
445,"00:24:38,776","00:24:40,142","Thank you, dear."
446,"00:24:40,144","00:24:41,544",It's for Kiera.
447,"00:24:41,546","00:24:43,978",That is so thoughtful of you.
448,"00:24:43,980","00:24:46,084","I just adore
truly thoughtful people."
449,"00:24:47,317","00:24:49,951","Seven, eight..."
450,"00:24:49,953","00:24:51,554","Thank you, ma'am."
451,"00:24:51,556","00:24:53,924","Now why don't you let me
help you out to your car."
452,"00:24:55,226","00:24:56,892","Hi there, Mr. Boudreaux."
453,"00:24:56,894","00:24:58,626","Hey, Josie."
454,"00:24:58,628","00:24:59,961",Let me get that for you.
455,"00:24:59,963","00:25:01,796",Thank you.
456,"00:25:01,798","00:25:03,164","Now, you all have a nice day."
457,"00:25:03,166","00:25:05,668","We sure will, dear."
458,"00:25:05,670","00:25:07,172",Idiot.
459,"00:25:17,048","00:25:19,681","That was quite a punch
you socked me with yesterday."
460,"00:25:19,683","00:25:21,216","That was just
a warning shot."
461,"00:25:21,218","00:25:22,721","- Yeah?
- Uh-hmm."
462,"00:25:23,753","00:25:25,219",So this is where you work.
463,"00:25:25,221","00:25:26,956",I own it.
464,"00:25:26,958","00:25:29,924","I bought it after Mrs. Quinn
passed five years ago."
465,"00:25:29,926","00:25:30,959",Wow.
466,"00:25:30,961","00:25:32,193","Yes, Liam,"
467,"00:25:32,195","00:25:34,162","I actually did something
with my life"
468,"00:25:34,164","00:25:36,131",after you walked out on me.
469,"00:25:36,133","00:25:38,334","And yes, a lot of people
in this town"
470,"00:25:38,336","00:25:41,202","have come and gone
since you were last here."
471,"00:25:41,204","00:25:43,641","My mama passed away.
Do you even know about that?"
472,"00:25:45,108","00:25:46,174",No.
473,"00:25:46,176","00:25:49,944","I'm so sorry, I had no idea."
474,"00:25:49,946","00:25:52,081","Have you noticed
that in the past eight years"
475,"00:25:52,083","00:25:53,716","no one and, I mean,"
476,"00:25:53,718","00:25:56,084","no one in this little town
of ours has ever spoken"
477,"00:25:56,086","00:25:58,353","to the press about you
or your life here ever?"
478,"00:25:58,355","00:26:01,256","Have you also noticed that no
one's taken a picture of you,"
479,"00:26:01,258","00:26:04,192","posted it on Facebook,
Instagram, nothing?"
480,"00:26:04,194","00:26:06,795","Now, why do you suppose
that is, Liam?"
481,"00:26:06,797","00:26:08,296",Because I walked out on you.
482,"00:26:08,298","00:26:11,734","Liam, it's because you
left us all that day,"
483,"00:26:11,736","00:26:13,104",the entire town.
484,"00:26:14,739","00:26:17,840","No one's spoken
about what you did here"
485,"00:26:17,842","00:26:19,844","because we have each other's
backs here in Saint."
486,"00:26:20,911","00:26:22,644",We're a family.
487,"00:26:22,646","00:26:23,781",We're loyal.
488,"00:26:25,215","00:26:27,718","But you don't belong here
anymore, Liam."
489,"00:26:29,819","00:26:31,255",Please just leave.
490,"00:26:33,723","00:26:34,992","Hey, Mama."
491,"00:26:38,061","00:26:40,028","Hi, sweetie."
492,"00:26:40,030","00:26:42,331","Oh, my..."
493,"00:26:42,333","00:26:44,298",How was your day at school?
494,"00:26:44,300","00:26:47,268","You know, the usual,
nothing special."
495,"00:26:47,270","00:26:48,737","Hello, Liam."
496,"00:26:48,739","00:26:51,305","- Laura.
- You know what?"
497,"00:26:51,307","00:26:53,709","Laura is going to take you
all out for some cupcakes"
498,"00:26:53,711","00:26:55,110","at the diner, my treat."
499,"00:26:55,112","00:26:56,879","Actually, it's on me."
500,"00:26:56,881","00:26:58,247","Let's get going, okay?"
501,"00:26:58,249","00:27:00,882","I'm just going to have
some soup, no cupcakes."
502,"00:27:00,884","00:27:02,284","I don't want to spoil
my dinner."
503,"00:27:02,286","00:27:04,186","Oh, that sounds nice."
504,"00:27:04,188","00:27:05,453","Come on, guys, let's go."
505,"00:27:05,455","00:27:07,722","Hey, I know you."
506,"00:27:07,724","00:27:09,725","You were outside
the church yesterday."
507,"00:27:09,727","00:27:13,131","You're that country star
my mama listens to sometimes."
508,"00:27:14,464","00:27:17,065","I mean, I just sometimes
have the radio on."
509,"00:27:17,067","00:27:20,068","- Sometimes.
- Not really my cup of tea,"
510,"00:27:20,070","00:27:21,303",no offense.
511,"00:27:21,305","00:27:23,041",None taken.
512,"00:27:24,407","00:27:26,374",I'm a...
513,"00:27:26,376","00:27:28,376","I'm a friend
of your mom's."
514,"00:27:28,378","00:27:31,682","- Liam.
- Billy."
515,"00:27:33,817","00:27:34,985",Billy?
516,"00:27:37,320","00:27:38,689",Wow.
517,"00:27:39,990","00:27:42,157",That's a...
518,"00:27:42,159","00:27:44,359","- that's a really pretty name.
- Okay, sweet pea,"
519,"00:27:44,361","00:27:46,094","why don't you get going
with Laura, okay?"
520,"00:27:46,096","00:27:48,199","- And I will come up to meet...
- Just one little minute."
521,"00:27:51,134","00:27:53,768","How old are you, Billy?"
522,"00:27:53,770","00:27:55,237","I'm really small
for my age"
523,"00:27:55,239","00:27:57,873",and I'm losing my baby teeth
524,"00:27:57,875","00:28:00,142","much later than
everyone else at my age."
525,"00:28:00,144","00:28:03,444","I mean, they don't even have
the tiniest little wiggle yet,"
526,"00:28:03,446","00:28:05,247",but I'm seven.
527,"00:28:05,249","00:28:06,515",Okay.
528,"00:28:06,517","00:28:08,116","Cupcake time, let's go."
529,"00:28:08,118","00:28:09,084","Bye, Mama."
530,"00:28:09,086","00:28:10,818","Nice to meet you, Liam."
531,"00:28:10,820","00:28:12,520","Bye, sweet pea."
532,"00:28:12,522","00:28:15,757","Hey, give yourself
okay?"
533,"00:28:15,759","00:28:16,827",Okay.
534,"00:28:23,233","00:28:24,335","Seven, huh?"
535,"00:28:32,777","00:28:34,910","Well, I guess that
conversation that played out"
536,"00:28:34,912","00:28:36,879","a million times in my head
is actually about"
537,"00:28:36,881","00:28:38,247","to really happen, huh?"
538,"00:28:38,249","00:28:40,117",Yeah.
539,"00:28:41,484","00:28:43,153","Yeah, I think it is."
540,"00:28:45,355","00:28:47,157","I'm going to need a beer
for this one."
541,"00:29:13,884","00:29:15,584","I didn't find out
that I was pregnant"
542,"00:29:15,586","00:29:18,389","until a couple weeks
after our wedding day..."
543,"00:29:20,924","00:29:23,094","what was supposed
to be our wedding day."
544,"00:29:25,496","00:29:29,264","I was so angry and humiliated
after you just walked out on me"
545,"00:29:29,266","00:29:32,200",and yet somehow
546,"00:29:32,202","00:29:34,135","I mustered up
all of the strength"
547,"00:29:34,137","00:29:36,904",that I had left.
548,"00:29:36,906","00:29:38,809","I called to tell you
I was pregnant."
549,"00:29:41,612","00:29:43,948","Of course it went straight
to your voicemail."
550,"00:29:46,049","00:29:49,985",I left you some long message
551,"00:29:49,987","00:29:52,257",begging you to call me back.
552,"00:29:53,958","00:29:56,490",And then I promised myself
553,"00:29:56,492","00:29:59,026","that if you didn't have
the decency to call me back"
554,"00:29:59,028","00:30:00,528","to find out
what was so important"
555,"00:30:00,530","00:30:02,232",that I had to tell you...
556,"00:30:04,934","00:30:08,903","I was never going
to contact you again"
557,"00:30:08,905","00:30:11,506","because Billy and I,
we deserve better."
558,"00:30:22,653","00:30:26,520","You named her
after my mom, Josie."
559,"00:30:26,522","00:30:28,425","I did that
for your dad, Liam."
560,"00:30:30,193","00:30:33,094",She loves him so much.
561,"00:30:33,096","00:30:34,865",We all do.
562,"00:30:38,402","00:30:39,938","Hey, sis."
563,"00:30:41,638","00:30:43,471","What are you doing here,
Liam?"
564,"00:30:43,473","00:30:46,173","Haven't you put her through
enough in one lifetime?"
565,"00:30:46,175","00:30:47,609","Good to see you, too, Jake."
566,"00:30:47,611","00:30:51,013","You know what,
Liam was just leaving, actually."
567,"00:30:51,015","00:30:52,346","- Yeah?
- Yeah."
568,"00:30:52,348","00:30:54,484","- I was... I was just leaving.
- Uh-hmm."
569,"00:30:56,686","00:30:58,553",All right.
570,"00:31:05,362","00:31:07,062","Why didn't you
tell me, Dad?"
571,"00:31:07,064","00:31:08,997","- Tell you what?
- That I had a daughter."
572,"00:31:08,999","00:31:11,266","Why didn't you tell me
about Billy?"
573,"00:31:11,268","00:31:13,701","- I did tell you.
- When?"
574,"00:31:13,703","00:31:15,202","What are you talking about?
We haven't even..."
575,"00:31:15,204","00:31:16,705","we haven't even spoken
since I left."
576,"00:31:16,707","00:31:19,074","Yeah, exactly."
577,"00:31:19,076","00:31:22,710","I went to your first concert
there in Seattle."
578,"00:31:22,712","00:31:25,479","Wouldn't return my calls
so I had to track you down"
579,"00:31:25,481","00:31:28,482","like some kind of fan, find out
where you were performing."
580,"00:31:28,484","00:31:30,052","You... you were
at that show?"
581,"00:31:30,054","00:31:33,488","Yup. I even went backstage
to see you after."
582,"00:31:33,490","00:31:36,190","I had to plead
with one of the security guards"
583,"00:31:36,192","00:31:38,093","to let me in
to see my own son."
584,"00:31:38,095","00:31:40,295","And there...
there you were."
585,"00:31:40,297","00:31:42,663","You were so out of your mind
on God knows what,"
586,"00:31:42,665","00:31:46,133","I honestly thought I'd stumbled
into the wrong room."
587,"00:31:46,135","00:31:49,371","But even after that, I still
tried to tell you about Billy,"
588,"00:31:49,373","00:31:53,211","that you had this
amazing daughter on the way."
589,"00:31:55,045","00:31:56,378","I don't remember
any of that."
590,"00:31:56,380","00:31:57,679","Yeah, you don't?"
591,"00:31:57,681","00:31:59,680","Why don't I
refresh your memory?"
592,"00:31:59,682","00:32:02,217","You told me to leave
and never come back,"
593,"00:32:02,219","00:32:04,553","although in much
more colorful language."
594,"00:32:04,555","00:32:06,220","So what was I
supposed to do, Liam?"
595,"00:32:06,222","00:32:07,959","You were... you were
legally an adult."
596,"00:32:09,326","00:32:12,693","I couldn't force you
to come home with me."
597,"00:32:12,695","00:32:14,729","I was... I was really
messed up then, Dad."
598,"00:32:14,731","00:32:16,565","Yeah. Yeah.
Well, you really seem"
599,"00:32:16,567","00:32:18,266","to have it
all together now, son."
600,"00:32:18,268","00:32:19,504","So, good for you."
601,"00:32:23,606","00:32:26,074","You know what?
I just..."
602,"00:32:26,076","00:32:28,043","I don't get it, Liam."
603,"00:32:28,045","00:32:29,544",You were such a good kid.
604,"00:32:29,546","00:32:31,078","You were a great son.
You were..."
605,"00:32:31,080","00:32:32,713","you were great
to your friends,"
606,"00:32:32,715","00:32:34,615","and you were so in love
with Josie."
607,"00:32:34,617","00:32:38,120","What happened
to you, Liam?"
608,"00:32:38,122","00:32:40,721",What happened?
609,"00:32:40,723","00:32:42,524",I don't know.
610,"00:32:42,526","00:32:45,727","Well, that guy
I saw in Seattle that night,"
611,"00:32:45,729","00:32:47,496","I knew that Billy
and Josie were just"
612,"00:32:47,498","00:32:49,067",better off without him.
613,"00:32:50,534","00:32:51,569","So, yeah..."
614,"00:32:52,669","00:32:54,272","yeah, shame on me."
615,"00:33:11,788","00:33:14,623",♪ Gone from the eyes ♪
616,"00:33:14,625","00:33:18,626",♪ That were everything ♪

622,"00:33:39,148","00:33:40,582","Well, you know,"
623,"00:33:40,584","00:33:43,317",it's been a rough time
624,"00:33:43,319","00:33:45,620",here in Saint.
625,"00:33:45,622","00:33:47,221","It's been a rough few weeks,"
626,"00:33:47,223","00:33:50,592",and it's got me thinking a lot
627,"00:33:50,594","00:33:52,794",about mercy
628,"00:33:52,796","00:33:54,595",and forgiveness.
629,"00:33:54,597","00:33:56,465","You know, scripture says,"
630,"00:33:56,467","00:33:58,699","""Forgiveness for in love"
631,"00:33:58,701","00:34:00,802","in all love,"
632,"00:34:00,804","00:34:04,372","we must have the capacity
to forgive."""
633,"00:34:04,374","00:34:07,409","You know, to forgive,
it sounds so easy"
634,"00:34:07,411","00:34:09,311","in theory, doesn't it?"
635,"00:34:09,313","00:34:12,313",And yet it remains
636,"00:34:12,315","00:34:14,182",so profoundly difficult
637,"00:34:14,184","00:34:16,150",to achieve.
638,"00:34:16,152","00:34:18,686","Trust me, I know."
639,"00:34:18,688","00:34:20,354","You know, here
inside this church,"
640,"00:34:20,356","00:34:23,157","we've always practiced
forgiveness, haven't we?"
641,"00:34:23,159","00:34:26,161","So with that in mind,"
642,"00:34:26,163","00:34:27,795",let's try today
643,"00:34:27,797","00:34:30,664","to forgive those
that have hurt us"
644,"00:34:30,666","00:34:33,168",and to move forward.
645,"00:34:33,170","00:34:35,737","And if we can truly forgive,"
646,"00:34:35,739","00:34:39,206","then we can truly
be set free."
647,"00:34:39,208","00:34:40,374",Let us pray.
648,"00:34:44,514","00:34:45,746",I think he went out...
649,"00:34:48,885","00:34:50,353",Liam.
650,"00:34:51,889","00:34:53,255",I'm glad you're here.
651,"00:34:53,257","00:34:54,822","Come on,
stick around."
652,"00:34:54,824","00:34:56,458","- Pastor Page.
- Hi."
653,"00:34:56,460","00:34:57,494",Remember Ms. Johnson?
654,"00:34:59,496","00:35:00,896",Liam.
655,"00:35:00,898","00:35:02,463",Thank you so much for coming.
656,"00:35:02,465","00:35:03,664","- Good to see you.
- Hi."
657,"00:35:03,666","00:35:05,200",Thank you so much.
658,"00:35:05,202","00:35:07,869","- See you in fellowship.
- Thanks for"
659,"00:35:07,871","00:35:09,139",Thank you.
660,"00:35:11,641","00:35:14,175","Hey, I'm so sorry."
661,"00:35:14,177","00:35:15,876",Come here.
662,"00:35:23,519","00:35:25,186","Let's go out
this way."
663,"00:36:04,293","00:36:07,561","April 9th,
one saved message."
664,"00:36:07,563","00:36:09,363","Hi, Liam."
665,"00:36:09,365","00:36:10,932","It's me, Josie."
666,"00:36:29,987","00:36:31,222",Dad?
667,"00:36:56,713","00:36:57,815",Sweet.
668,"00:37:22,873","00:37:23,874",Hi.
669,"00:37:25,742","00:37:26,744",Hey.
670,"00:37:29,313","00:37:31,646","I'd like to buy
some flowers"
671,"00:37:31,648","00:37:32,650",for Kiera.
672,"00:37:34,684","00:37:36,383",Okay.
673,"00:37:36,385","00:37:38,086",Hydrangeas are her favorite.
674,"00:37:38,088","00:37:40,054",All right. Perfect.
675,"00:37:40,056","00:37:42,923","I'll get...
I'll get 24."
676,"00:37:42,925","00:37:44,761",Twenty-four?
677,"00:37:45,829","00:37:47,595",Yes.
678,"00:37:47,597","00:37:48,733",Please.
679,"00:37:52,335","00:37:53,370",Okay.
680,"00:37:58,708","00:38:00,675","This is 12,
grab that."
681,"00:38:00,677","00:38:01,711",Okay.
682,"00:38:04,947","00:38:06,613",Perfect.
683,"00:38:06,615","00:38:07,749",Uh-hmm.
684,"00:38:07,751","00:38:11,653",That will be $187.51.
685,"00:38:11,655","00:38:14,392","There.
Got my own credit card."
686,"00:38:15,592","00:38:17,061",Congratulations.
687,"00:38:18,628","00:38:20,128",I want to see Billy.
688,"00:38:20,130","00:38:21,595","Sign here, please."
689,"00:38:21,597","00:38:24,432","Look,
don't ignore me on..."
690,"00:38:24,434","00:38:28,135","I know that I haven't been
a great anything, all right?"
691,"00:38:28,137","00:38:30,607","But I want
to get to know her."
692,"00:38:31,942","00:38:33,575","I'm not going
to cause any trouble."
693,"00:38:33,577","00:38:35,409","It can all be
on your terms,"
694,"00:38:35,411","00:38:37,845","but she's my daughter,
too, Josie,"
695,"00:38:37,847","00:38:39,416",whether you like it or not.
696,"00:38:48,791","00:38:50,858","Can I have a little time
to think about it?"
697,"00:38:50,860","00:38:52,496",Yeah.
698,"00:38:53,530","00:38:55,066",Of course you can.
699,"00:38:58,001","00:38:59,900",Thank you.
700,"00:38:59,902","00:39:01,135",Yeah.
701,"00:39:01,137","00:39:02,373",Here.
702,"00:39:05,474","00:39:07,075","You got a pen
for me to sign?"
703,"00:39:07,077","00:39:10,043","You sign it
with your finger, Liam."
704,"00:39:10,045","00:39:13,416",Yeah. I knew that.
705,"00:39:14,751","00:39:16,483","Do you need help
with those?"
706,"00:39:16,485","00:39:17,922","No, I got them."
707,"00:39:26,829","00:39:28,662",Eight is thirty-two...
708,"00:39:28,664","00:39:30,465","always try
to remember that one."
709,"00:39:30,467","00:39:31,766",That's a really good one.
710,"00:39:31,768","00:39:33,133","Do you want me
to cut you a piece?"
711,"00:39:33,135","00:39:35,806","- Ready?
- Cheers."
712,"00:39:37,173","00:39:39,206",Mmm!
713,"00:39:39,208","00:39:40,508","Good, huh?"
714,"00:39:40,510","00:39:41,679",Uh-hmm.
715,"00:39:45,681","00:39:47,617","So, sweet pea,
there is..."
716,"00:39:49,152","00:39:51,489","there's actually something
I want to talk to you about."
717,"00:39:52,621","00:39:54,491",It's about your daddy.
718,"00:39:56,726","00:39:59,927","I thought you never wanted
to talk about him?"
719,"00:39:59,929","00:40:01,229",I did not.
720,"00:40:01,231","00:40:03,530","But that is
not fair to you."
721,"00:40:03,532","00:40:05,700","You have a right
to know your father."
722,"00:40:05,702","00:40:08,235","But that only is
if you want to,"
723,"00:40:08,237","00:40:10,472","because if you don't,
that's okay, too."
724,"00:40:10,474","00:40:11,539",I don't know.
725,"00:40:11,541","00:40:12,943",He seemed nice to me.
726,"00:40:15,244","00:40:17,010","The guy
from outside the church"
727,"00:40:17,012","00:40:19,112","and the flower shop, right?"
728,"00:40:19,114","00:40:20,949","You two weren't
exactly subtle,"
729,"00:40:20,951","00:40:22,086",if you know what I mean.
730,"00:40:25,222","00:40:26,824",How did you get...
731,"00:40:28,992","00:40:30,060",Okay.
732,"00:40:33,530","00:40:34,628",Yes.
733,"00:40:34,630","00:40:36,930","Now sweet pea,
we met when we were"
734,"00:40:36,932","00:40:38,967","very, very young."
735,"00:40:38,969","00:40:41,001","But it's important
that you know"
736,"00:40:41,003","00:40:44,104","that he did not
abandon you, okay?"
737,"00:40:44,106","00:40:46,508","He didn't even know
that I was pregnant."
738,"00:40:46,510","00:40:48,510","Yeah.
He looked pretty shocked"
739,"00:40:48,512","00:40:50,110",when he saw me.
740,"00:40:50,112","00:40:52,045","We should invite him
over for dinner."
741,"00:40:52,047","00:40:54,217","Might help him
process the news."
742,"00:40:57,052","00:40:58,186",Are you sure?
743,"00:40:58,188","00:41:00,090","Yeah, I'm sure."
744,"00:41:05,027","00:41:07,964","You amaze me, child."
745,"00:41:10,166","00:41:11,766","Uh-uh,
that's my blackberry!"
746,"00:41:11,768","00:41:13,133","Don't you dare
eat that, Billy."
747,"00:41:13,135","00:41:14,601",Billy!
748,"00:41:14,603","00:41:16,537","- Okay, Maria?
- Yes, ma'am."
749,"00:41:16,539","00:41:17,738","Hey, try Liam."
750,"00:41:17,740","00:41:19,007","- Of course, ma'am.
- Please."
751,"00:41:19,009","00:41:20,008","Oh, and you know what?"
752,"00:41:20,010","00:41:21,543","Oh, hold that
for a second."
753,"00:41:21,545","00:41:23,610","I want a...
I want a Cobb salad,"
754,"00:41:23,612","00:41:25,112","just... I want it
with no chicken,"
755,"00:41:25,114","00:41:26,914","no tomato,
no cheese, no corn."
756,"00:41:26,916","00:41:28,182","You know, I'll call it in."
757,"00:41:28,184","00:41:29,918","I'll call it in
because the last time,"
758,"00:41:29,920","00:41:32,019","you messed it up and you got
me something with bananas."
759,"00:41:39,295","00:41:40,827",Yeah. Hello?
760,"00:41:40,829","00:41:42,764","Liam, it's late,
wake up."
761,"00:41:42,766","00:41:45,700","Yeah, I am awake."
762,"00:41:45,702","00:41:47,702","- Who is this?
- Hello?"
763,"00:41:47,704","00:41:49,970","It's Doris Grossnickle Hines,"
764,"00:41:49,972","00:41:51,204",your favorite lifeline.
765,"00:41:51,206","00:41:53,273","Oh, hey, Doris."
766,"00:41:53,275","00:41:54,976","Hey, so guess
where I have the paparazzi"
767,"00:41:54,978","00:41:56,209",thinking you are right now?
768,"00:41:56,211","00:41:59,713","Uh, somewhere
in the Caribbean, right?"
769,"00:41:59,715","00:42:02,182","Yes. St. Barts
at a rehab for exhaustion."
770,"00:42:02,184","00:42:05,086","They are on a wild goose chase
as we speak."
771,"00:42:05,088","00:42:06,588","- Great.
- So, listen,"
772,"00:42:06,590","00:42:07,988","those pap smears
can only run around"
773,"00:42:07,990","00:42:09,691","that tiny little island
for so long"
774,"00:42:09,693","00:42:12,025","without figuring out
even in their tiny brains"
775,"00:42:12,027","00:42:13,360",that you are not there.
776,"00:42:13,362","00:42:16,630","So, L-I-am, when am I
going to tell the public"
777,"00:42:16,632","00:42:18,800","that you are out
of that sexy little rehab?"
778,"00:42:18,802","00:42:20,233",Because your fans
779,"00:42:20,235","00:42:22,336","are chomping
at the bit right now."
780,"00:42:22,338","00:42:24,674","I'm in my hometown
right now, Doris."
781,"00:42:26,842","00:42:28,278","An old friend of mine
passed away."
782,"00:42:29,945","00:42:31,345",Oh.
783,"00:42:31,347","00:42:33,914","Oh, that's terrible."
784,"00:42:33,916","00:42:35,950","I'm so sorry, Liam."
785,"00:42:35,952","00:42:38,720","But, listen to me, funerals
are much better than rehab"
786,"00:42:38,722","00:42:40,021","for playing the sympathy card,"
787,"00:42:40,023","00:42:41,322",so what I want you to do
788,"00:42:41,324","00:42:42,956","is take as many selfies
as you can of yourself"
789,"00:42:42,958","00:42:44,124","in the shower,
shirtless, bottomless,"
790,"00:42:44,126","00:42:45,392","I don't care,
in the coffin,"
791,"00:42:45,394","00:42:47,327","by the coffin,
hugging the corpse."
792,"00:42:47,329","00:42:49,063","It doesn't... just get
these pictures into me"
793,"00:42:49,065","00:42:50,398","and I will get you
the cover of People."
794,"00:42:50,400","00:42:52,133","Yeah. Goodbye, Doris."
795,"00:42:52,135","00:42:54,034",Liam?
796,"00:42:54,036","00:42:55,605",Did he just hang up on me?
797,"00:42:57,407","00:42:59,307",Uh-uh. Uh-uh.
798,"00:43:01,177","00:43:02,613",This is not good.
799,"00:43:11,320","00:43:12,753",Hello?
800,"00:43:12,755","00:43:14,889","I need
to buy something, Sam,"
801,"00:43:14,891","00:43:16,423",on the internet.
802,"00:43:16,425","00:43:17,925","- Are you drunk?
- No."
803,"00:43:17,927","00:43:19,360",I have not been drinking. I...
804,"00:43:19,362","00:43:23,097","Say if I wanted to buy
an espresso machine,"
805,"00:43:23,099","00:43:25,032","how would I...
how do I go about doing that?"
806,"00:43:25,034","00:43:28,168","Okay. You Google it
and you click buy."
807,"00:43:28,170","00:43:31,139","Oh, it's... so it's that easy."
808,"00:43:31,141","00:43:32,440","Okay. All right.
Say if I..."
809,"00:43:32,442","00:43:34,374",if I wanted to buy
810,"00:43:34,376","00:43:38,746","some jewelry or a teddy bear,
how would I do that?"
811,"00:43:38,748","00:43:41,048","Okay. What the heck's
going on down there, Liam?"
812,"00:43:41,050","00:43:42,950","I mean, you said you're going
to be there for a few days,"
813,"00:43:42,952","00:43:45,353","- and...
- Yeah, uh..."
814,"00:43:45,355","00:43:47,755",I think I might...
815,"00:43:47,757","00:43:49,757","I might be staying
for a little longer."
816,"00:43:49,759","00:43:53,396","Okay. Great. So how long
are we talking about?"
817,"00:43:55,164","00:43:57,365",Turns out...
818,"00:43:57,367","00:44:00,168",I have a daughter.
819,"00:44:00,170","00:44:01,436",What? Shoot.
820,"00:44:01,438","00:44:03,137","Liam, with a groupie?"
821,"00:44:03,139","00:44:05,940",My ex-fiancée
822,"00:44:05,942","00:44:08,742",from a long time ago. Um...
823,"00:44:08,744","00:44:11,012","She's seven,"
824,"00:44:11,014","00:44:13,150",and her name's Billy.
825,"00:44:15,217","00:44:17,050",Sam? You alive?
826,"00:44:17,052","00:44:19,186","You... no, yeah, I'm..."
827,"00:44:19,188","00:44:20,854","I mean, wow."
828,"00:44:20,856","00:44:24,057","Oh, Liam Page
is a dad."
829,"00:44:24,059","00:44:26,996","You think I'm going
to be terrible at it?"
830,"00:44:30,099","00:44:31,402","No, no, no, no, no."
831,"00:44:33,068","00:44:34,337",I think you'll be great.

her out of her cage?"

897,"00:47:55,938","00:47:58,438","So, my mama played me
some more of your songs."

get to know each other"
902,"00:48:07,583","00:48:09,150",or something.
903,"00:48:09,152","00:48:12,655","Yeah, I'd like that."
904,"00:48:14,289","00:48:17,094","Why don't you pick me up
after school tomorrow?"
905,"00:48:18,994","00:48:23,000","I would love that, Billy."
906,"00:48:24,500","00:48:27,068","That was terrible.
I was terrible."
907,"00:48:27,070","00:48:29,503","I mean, I don't know
how to do kids."
908,"00:48:29,505","00:48:30,972",She hated that teddy bear
909,"00:48:30,974","00:48:32,740","just like you hated
that necklace."
910,"00:48:32,742","00:48:36,443","Liam, Billy doesn't need you
to buy her things,"
911,"00:48:36,445","00:48:39,313","and I don't need you
to buy me anything, either."

- No, no, no, wait, wait,"
918,"00:49:31,333","00:49:33,233","wait, wait, wait."
919,"00:49:33,235","00:49:35,235","She asked me if I...
if I could pick her up"
920,"00:49:35,237","00:49:36,472",from school tomorrow.
921,"00:49:38,306","00:49:42,108","Liam, this is moving
way too fast."
922,"00:49:42,110","00:49:43,711","You're gone for eight years
and now you wanna pick up"
923,"00:49:43,713","00:49:44,811",my daughter from school?
924,"00:49:44,813","00:49:46,046",Our daughter.
925,"00:49:46,048","00:49:48,782",I...
926,"00:49:48,784","00:49:52,119","I'm... I have no right
to ask for much here at all."

929,"00:49:57,326","00:49:59,592","and I wanna be here, Josie."
930,"00:49:59,594","00:50:02,295",I wanna get to know Billy.
931,"00:50:02,297","00:50:04,697","Please, just give me
the opportunity"
932,"00:50:04,699","00:50:05,768",to do that.
933,"00:50:08,670","00:50:10,137","- I'll beg.
- Okay. Okay."
934,"00:50:10,139","00:50:11,505","You want me to beg?
I'll beg for you."
935,"00:50:11,507","00:50:12,639","- Liam, Liam...
- I'll beg for you."
936,"00:50:12,641","00:50:14,110","Liam, stop. Get up."
937,"00:50:16,813","00:50:19,112","Fine, tomorrow..."
938,"00:50:19,114","00:50:21,115","meet me at 3:00
at the old benches."
939,"00:50:21,117","00:50:22,516","We can pick her up
together."
940,"00:50:22,518","00:50:24,385",Thank you.
941,"00:50:24,387","00:50:25,786",Do not be late.
942,"00:50:25,788","00:50:27,554",I won't be late.
943,"00:50:27,556","00:50:29,590",I promise.
944,"00:50:29,592","00:50:31,724","What time?
What time was it again?"
945,"00:50:31,726","00:50:33,394",Liam.
946,"00:50:33,396","00:50:35,332",I know what time it is.
947,"00:50:37,532","00:50:39,800","Well,
fancy meeting you here."
948,"00:50:39,802","00:50:41,168",Uh-hmm.
949,"00:50:41,170","00:50:42,536","Can I help you
with that?"
950,"00:50:42,538","00:50:43,472",Yup.
951,"00:50:46,275","00:50:49,209",What is this?
952,"00:50:49,211","00:50:51,412","It's a car seat,"
953,"00:50:51,414","00:50:54,248","you know, for a child
to ride in a car."
954,"00:50:54,250","00:50:55,615","- Never heard of it.
- Oh, my God,"
955,"00:50:55,617","00:50:57,284","maybe this wasn't
such a good idea."
956,"00:50:57,286","00:50:59,487","I know
what a car seat is."
957,"00:50:59,489","00:51:01,755","Come on, give me
a little credit."
958,"00:51:01,757","00:51:03,523","Okay, so, she's gonna be
coming out"
959,"00:51:03,525","00:51:05,693",of these doors right here.
960,"00:51:05,695","00:51:08,798","Wow, same doors
we used to come out of."
961,"00:51:10,132","00:51:12,101",Oh.
962,"00:51:14,603","00:51:15,735","Oh, man."
963,"00:51:15,737","00:51:16,903",You need to get that?
964,"00:51:16,905","00:51:18,671","No, no,"
965,"00:51:18,673","00:51:21,608",it's my publicist.
966,"00:51:24,847","00:51:27,818","Is it the same phone
you've had since high school?"
967,"00:51:30,652","00:51:32,887","I don't...
I don't think so, no."
968,"00:51:32,889","00:51:34,487",I remember it.
969,"00:51:34,489","00:51:35,491",I...
970,"00:51:37,193","00:51:38,858","it's... no, it's..."
971,"00:51:38,860","00:51:40,760","I don't...
I don't think it is."
972,"00:51:40,762","00:51:42,695","It has an antenna, Liam."
973,"00:51:42,697","00:51:45,932","I mean, I just...
I like the phone, okay?"
974,"00:51:45,934","00:51:47,934",Okay.
975,"00:51:49,304","00:51:50,806","- Oh.
- Ooh."
976,"00:51:52,240","00:51:55,809","Oh, it's Kiera.
I have to take this."
977,"00:51:55,811","00:51:57,411",Hey.
978,"00:51:57,413","00:51:59,445","Oh, no, no, no, sweetie,
don't cry."
979,"00:51:59,447","00:52:01,548","You know what,
I'm at Wilmington,"
980,"00:52:01,550","00:52:03,184","but I can be there
in ten minutes."
981,"00:52:03,186","00:52:04,418",Is that okay?
982,"00:52:04,420","00:52:05,653","I'm gonna call you
from the car, Kiera."
983,"00:52:05,655","00:52:07,454",We'll be right there.
984,"00:52:07,456","00:52:09,459","She's having
a really rough time."
985,"00:52:10,893","00:52:12,258","So, you're going?"
986,"00:52:12,260","00:52:13,927","- You're going right now?
- Yeah."
987,"00:52:13,929","00:52:16,396","I mean unless you don't think
you can handle this alone."
988,"00:52:16,398","00:52:18,199","I... I'm... I'll just...
I'll take her in the car."
989,"00:52:18,201","00:52:19,432","Okay, I'm gonna
call Laura."
990,"00:52:19,434","00:52:20,967","She's picking up
her kids anyways."
991,"00:52:20,969","00:52:22,269","- No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
- It's really no problem..."
992,"00:52:22,271","00:52:23,903","No, no, no, I'm sorry."
993,"00:52:23,905","00:52:26,307","Look, I..."
994,"00:52:26,309","00:52:28,675","My dad's house is like
two minutes from here."
995,"00:52:28,677","00:52:30,510","I think I'll be...
I'll be all right."
996,"00:52:30,512","00:52:32,278","- Okay.
- Yeah?"
997,"00:52:32,280","00:52:33,581",Okay.
998,"00:52:33,583","00:52:35,449","Billy knows how to put
that in the car."
999,"00:52:35,451","00:52:36,717","Okay, that's lucky."
1000,"00:52:36,719","00:52:39,987","So, just pay attention
to what she says."
1001,"00:52:39,989","00:52:42,722","You call me the moment
you all get home, okay?"
1002,"00:52:42,724","00:52:43,891",Yeah.
1003,"00:52:43,893","00:52:45,528",Tell her I love her.
1004,"00:52:47,963","00:52:49,929",All right.
1005,"00:52:49,931","00:52:51,433","Oh, man."
1006,"00:53:00,675","00:53:02,443","Jumping in the deep
end, huh?"
1007,"00:53:02,445","00:53:04,612","- Yeah.
- Car seat and all."
1008,"00:53:04,614","00:53:07,514","- Yeah.
- Where is your car?"
1009,"00:53:07,516","00:53:08,718",Right here.
1010,"00:53:13,521","00:53:15,488",That's your car?
1011,"00:53:15,490","00:53:16,889",Yeah.
1012,"00:53:16,891","00:53:18,592",What's wrong with it?
1013,"00:53:18,594","00:53:20,494",I don't do convertibles.
1014,"00:53:20,496","00:53:22,499",They're too dangerous.
1015,"00:53:24,634","00:53:26,700","Come on. It'll be fun, no?"
1016,"00:53:26,702","00:53:29,536","Do you know the stats
in surviving an accident"
1017,"00:53:29,538","00:53:31,240",in a convertible?
1018,"00:53:33,041","00:53:34,575","No. No, I do not."
1019,"00:53:34,577","00:53:36,476","Well, they are low, Liam,"
1020,"00:53:36,478","00:53:37,911",staggeringly low.
1021,"00:53:37,913","00:53:41,447","Do you wanna know
exactly how low?"
1022,"00:53:41,449","00:53:43,252","You know what,
I'm all right."
1023,"00:53:50,592","00:53:51,825",What about Grampy's car?
1024,"00:53:51,827","00:53:53,693","Maybe...
do you like his car?"
1025,"00:53:53,695","00:53:55,295","- Is his car okay?
- Yeah."
1026,"00:53:55,297","00:53:57,930",Yeah? All right.
1027,"00:53:57,932","00:54:01,001","Do you know Grampy's...
do you not know his number?"
1028,"00:54:01,003","00:54:02,670",Now?
1029,"00:54:02,672","00:54:04,338","Yeah,
on the count of three,"
1030,"00:54:04,340","00:54:06,507","one, two, hold on, hold on,"
1031,"00:54:06,509","00:54:09,909","be careful now, and three."
1032,"00:54:09,911","00:54:11,445","It smells good,
doesn't it?"
1033,"00:54:11,447","00:54:12,849","- Can I stir?
- Yeah."
1034,"00:54:16,686","00:54:18,385","You're going
to ruin your dinner"
1035,"00:54:18,387","00:54:19,619","with that,
you know."
1036,"00:54:19,621","00:54:23,856","Well, sometimes
you just got to let go."
1037,"00:54:23,858","00:54:25,391","Take a walk
on the wild side."
1038,"00:54:25,393","00:54:27,763","Trust that everything
is going to be okay."
1039,"00:54:30,565","00:54:32,768","Is that chocolate
chocolate chip?"
1040,"00:54:33,869","00:54:35,536",Uh-hmm.
1041,"00:54:35,538","00:54:38,405","I mean, it's the only flavor
that matters."
1042,"00:54:38,407","00:54:40,074",You want some?
1043,"00:54:40,076","00:54:42,041",It's pretty good.
1044,"00:54:42,043","00:54:43,376",Hmm?
1045,"00:54:43,378","00:54:44,744","Grampy, is it okay?"
1046,"00:54:44,746","00:54:47,648","Um, yeah, half a scoop,
all right?"
1047,"00:54:47,650","00:54:48,852","Don't ruin
your supper."
1048,"00:54:50,585","00:54:52,753","You want to do it, okay."
1049,"00:54:52,755","00:54:55,755","There we go,
all right."
1050,"00:54:55,757","00:54:57,657","Now, we're living.
Yeah, look at that."
1051,"00:54:57,659","00:54:59,693","That's a mountain, wow."
1052,"00:54:59,695","00:55:02,095","Okay. All right,
one big, big bite."
1053,"00:55:02,097","00:55:03,831","Who can take
the biggest bite?"
1054,"00:55:03,833","00:55:04,934","One, two, three..."
1055,"00:55:06,702","00:55:09,836","Whoa, that's a big bite."
1056,"00:55:09,838","00:55:11,604","- Uh-oh, uh-uh.
- Oh."
1057,"00:55:11,606","00:55:14,108","Guess what,
brain freeze?"
1058,"00:55:14,110","00:55:15,675","- Brain freeze.
- No!"
1059,"00:55:15,677","00:55:17,110","- Brain freeze!
- Maybe this wasn't such"
1060,"00:55:17,112","00:55:18,144",a good idea after all.
1061,"00:55:18,146","00:55:19,715",No.
1062,"00:55:20,882","00:55:22,618","- One sec.
- Oh."
1063,"00:55:24,920","00:55:26,153","- What?
- It's going"
1064,"00:55:26,155","00:55:27,487","- to ruin her supper.
- You should've seen"
1065,"00:55:27,489","00:55:28,521","her face, Dad."
1066,"00:55:28,523","00:55:30,059","You should see
all this gumbo."
1067,"00:55:33,628","00:55:35,528",Is this yours?
1068,"00:55:35,530","00:55:38,030","I found it in Grampy's closet
a while back."
1069,"00:55:38,032","00:55:40,002","Yeah, wow."
1070,"00:55:42,538","00:55:46,039","I have not seen you
for a long time."
1071,"00:55:46,041","00:55:48,108","How do you come up
with songs to play?"
1072,"00:55:48,110","00:55:50,543","Well, the truth is,"
1073,"00:55:50,545","00:55:52,713","I have not been
very good at it lately,"
1074,"00:55:52,715","00:55:54,113",but don't tell anyone.
1075,"00:55:54,115","00:55:55,581","Well, just start playing."
1076,"00:55:55,583","00:55:56,849",Let's see what happens.
1077,"00:55:56,851","00:55:58,050",Okay.
1078,"00:55:58,052","00:56:01,121","All right, smarty pants."
1079,"00:56:01,123","00:56:02,858","What do you want me
to write a song about?"
1080,"00:56:04,527","00:56:08,061",Something about...
1081,"00:56:08,063","00:56:09,595","right now,"
1082,"00:56:09,597","00:56:10,764",here with us.
1083,"00:56:10,766","00:56:11,901",Okay.
1084,"00:56:14,202","00:56:15,871",Right now...
1085,"00:56:17,440","00:56:18,842",here with us.
1086,"00:56:22,478","00:56:25,148","Let's just start
with a melody, shall we?"
1087,"00:56:41,197","00:56:43,130",That's nice.
1088,"00:56:43,132","00:56:46,133",I like that.
1089,"00:57:03,485","00:57:06,987","Who taught you to play
the guitar like that?"
1090,"00:57:06,989","00:57:08,956","Well, my mom."
1091,"00:57:08,958","00:57:10,224",My mama did
1092,"00:57:10,226","00:57:12,959","when I was a little older
than you, actually."
1093,"00:57:16,965","00:57:19,733",♪ I always do ♪
1094,"00:57:19,735","00:57:21,200","Ow, ow, ow, ow,
ow, ow, ow, ow..."
1095,"00:57:21,202","00:57:22,970","Oh, uh..."
1096,"00:57:22,972","00:57:24,505","- You all right there?
- Yeah,"
1097,"00:57:24,507","00:57:25,873",but grab that towel there.
1098,"00:57:25,875","00:57:27,840","See if you just...
can get this other side."
1099,"00:57:27,842","00:57:29,075",It is pretty heavy.
1100,"00:57:29,077","00:57:31,278","What do you got in there,
some bricks?"
1101,"00:57:31,280","00:57:33,813","Yeah, a lot of
gumbo and it's hot, hot, hot."
1102,"00:57:33,815","00:57:35,682","- Whoa, whoa, whoa.
- It's all right, yeah."
1103,"00:57:37,286","00:57:38,851","Smells pretty good, Dad."
1104,"00:57:38,853","00:57:40,287",That's a lot of gumbo.
1105,"00:57:51,132","00:57:52,601",Billy?
1106,"00:57:54,202","00:57:55,702",You play the guitar?
1107,"00:57:55,704","00:57:56,773",Nope.
1108,"00:57:57,840","00:57:59,706",No?
1109,"00:57:59,708","00:58:02,976","So, how do you explain what
you're doing right there?"
1110,"00:58:02,978","00:58:05,615","By watching
what you just did."
1111,"00:58:09,083","00:58:10,883",So...
1112,"00:58:10,885","00:58:12,818","you didn't learn it
at school, or..."
1113,"00:58:12,820","00:58:13,920",Nope.
1114,"00:58:13,922","00:58:16,623",We don't have that at school.
1115,"00:58:16,625","00:58:19,258","Wow, uh..."
1116,"00:58:19,260","00:58:20,961",Billy?
1117,"00:58:20,963","00:58:22,295",Yes.
1118,"00:58:22,297","00:58:24,030",How would you like it
1119,"00:58:24,032","00:58:25,898",if I took you to a shop
1120,"00:58:25,900","00:58:29,336","and bought you a guitar
of your very own?"
1121,"00:58:29,338","00:58:32,639","Why? Yes, yes!"
1122,"00:58:32,641","00:58:33,974",Yes? All right.
1123,"00:58:33,976","00:58:36,008",Then it's a date.
1124,"00:58:41,016","00:58:42,182","Hey, sweet pea."
1125,"00:58:42,184","00:58:43,583",How did your day go?
1126,"00:58:43,585","00:58:46,119","I had the best time
with you."
1127,"00:58:46,121","00:58:48,621","Thank you so much, Liam."
1128,"00:58:48,623","00:58:51,090","Wow, thank you."
1129,"00:58:51,092","00:58:52,858",Me too.
1130,"00:58:52,860","00:58:55,028","I'll see you tomorrow
for guitar shopping."
1131,"00:58:55,030","00:58:56,132",Yeah.
1132,"00:59:00,369","00:59:02,235","So, guitar shopping?"
1133,"00:59:02,237","00:59:04,740","Did you know that Billy
plays the guitar?"
1134,"00:59:07,943","00:59:10,776","- Billy?
- Yeah."
1135,"00:59:10,778","00:59:12,378","She just picked it up
and started playing."
1136,"00:59:12,380","00:59:14,113","It was like...
it was pouring out of her"
1137,"00:59:14,115","00:59:15,282","like she'd been playing
her whole life."
1138,"00:59:15,284","00:59:16,749","Billy can play
the guitar?"
1139,"00:59:16,751","00:59:18,385",Yes.
1140,"00:59:18,387","00:59:20,590",That's crazy.
1141,"00:59:23,324","00:59:25,157","I'm sorry, I told her"
1142,"00:59:25,159","00:59:28,695","I was going to get her
a guitar."
1143,"00:59:28,697","00:59:30,396","Is it okay if we go
guitar shopping"

together, obviously."
1148,"00:59:40,675","00:59:43,142","So, you, me,
and Billy?"
1149,"00:59:43,144","00:59:44,646",Yeah.
1150,"00:59:48,983","00:59:52,653","Nothing's going to happen
between us, Liam."
1151,"00:59:52,655","00:59:54,691",I never said it was.
1152,"00:59:58,994","01:00:02,128","- Hey, Josie.

- Yeah."
1203,"01:02:30,913","01:02:31,912","- So...
- I..."
1204,"01:02:31,914","01:02:33,380",...am I doing this right?

- Hey, Liam,"
1212,"01:02:45,293","01:02:47,226",can I ask you a question?
1213,"01:02:47,228","01:02:49,865","Yeah, sure."
1214,"01:02:52,501","01:02:54,133",What happened?
1215,"01:02:54,135","01:02:56,404","I mean, why did you
leave my mama?"
1216,"01:02:59,007","01:03:01,273","Oh, man. Um..."
1217,"01:03:01,275","01:03:04,911","Well, the short answer"
1218,"01:03:04,913","01:03:07,947",is that I was young
1219,"01:03:07,949","01:03:10,182",and dumb.
1220,"01:03:10,184","01:03:15,123","And that's pretty much
the long answer, too."
1221,"01:03:21,262","01:03:24,930",All I can tell you is that...
1222,"01:03:24,932","01:03:28,334",this one night
1223,"01:03:28,336","01:03:32,072","me and your mom were singing
in a karaoke bar."
1224,"01:03:32,074","01:03:34,340","We were just goofing around,"
1225,"01:03:34,342","01:03:37,043","but as luck would have it,"
1226,"01:03:37,045","01:03:41,081","this record exec
heard me singing,"
1227,"01:03:41,083","01:03:44,617","and he asked me
to record a song,"
1228,"01:03:44,619","01:03:47,186","and then next thing I know
it's all over the radio,"
1229,"01:03:47,188","01:03:49,923","and then I'm off on tour,
just like that"
1230,"01:03:49,925","01:03:53,626",like one big wild tornado.
1231,"01:03:53,628","01:03:55,998","But why didn't you take
my mama with you?"
1232,"01:04:00,434","01:04:03,903","I wish I did, Billy,"
1233,"01:04:03,905","01:04:05,574",really I do.
1234,"01:04:06,641","01:04:07,943",But I...
1235,"01:04:09,177","01:04:11,244","I was so young,
I just... I didn't..."
1236,"01:04:11,246","01:04:12,579",I didn't know...
1237,"01:04:12,581","01:04:14,914","I didn't know
how to handle"
1238,"01:04:14,916","01:04:16,152",being famous.
1239,"01:04:17,418","01:04:19,686",I guess I just...
1240,"01:04:19,688","01:04:21,387",I got lost
1241,"01:04:21,389","01:04:23,123","and I got lost
for such a long time"
1242,"01:04:23,125","01:04:25,958","and I couldn't find
my way back."
1243,"01:04:25,960","01:04:29,095","But you find
your way back now."
1244,"01:04:29,097","01:04:30,633","You're back, right?"
1245,"01:04:32,467","01:04:34,367",Yeah.
1246,"01:04:34,369","01:04:36,405","Yeah, I'm back, Billy."
1247,"01:04:37,972","01:04:39,108",I'm back.
1248,"01:04:40,342","01:04:42,108","- Hey, Liam.
- Uh-hmm?"
1249,"01:04:42,110","01:04:43,445",Could I...
1250,"01:04:44,579","01:04:47,283",maybe call you Dad?
1251,"01:04:52,487","01:04:53,521",Dad?
1252,"01:04:55,023","01:04:56,623","Yeah, I would love that"
1253,"01:04:56,625","01:04:58,657","more than anything,"
1254,"01:04:58,659","01:04:59,995","- really.
- Uh-hmm."
1255,"01:05:01,730","01:05:03,229","- Okay.
- Okay?"
1256,"01:05:03,231","01:05:05,264","- Okay. Good night.
- Good night."
1257,"01:05:05,266","01:05:06,465",Bye.
1258,"01:05:06,467","01:05:08,403","- You're going to go to sleep?
- Uh-hmm."
1259,"01:05:15,744","01:05:20,412",Uh...
1260,"01:05:20,414","01:05:21,648",Billy just asked
1261,"01:05:21,650","01:05:24,420",if she can call me Dad.
1262,"01:05:27,121","01:05:28,621",Yeah.
1263,"01:05:28,623","01:05:30,626","That's a lot
of responsibility."
1264,"01:05:31,693","01:05:33,162","Yeah, I know."
1265,"01:05:34,228","01:05:35,697","It's forever, Liam."
1266,"01:05:37,465","01:05:38,500",I know.

1268,"01:05:49,777","01:05:51,443",Okay.
1269,"01:05:51,445","01:05:52,447",Okay.
1270,"01:05:57,753","01:06:00,119","I should probably get
inside or something."
1271,"01:06:00,121","01:06:01,621","Oh, ooh."
1272,"01:06:01,623","01:06:03,992","- Are you okay?
- I'm just a little bit tipsy."
1273,"01:06:16,804","01:06:19,040","Think maybe
you could drive me home?"
1274,"01:06:21,108","01:06:22,143",Nope.
1275,"01:06:26,313","01:06:29,581","Dad, I'm going

1336,"01:09:03,637","01:09:04,970",I did. You want to do it?
1337,"01:09:04,972","01:09:06,438","- Yeah!
- Yes?"
1338,"01:09:06,440","01:09:07,809",All right.
1339,"01:09:08,877","01:09:10,375","Grampy's in his car,"
1340,"01:09:10,377","01:09:12,644","so we're going to just
have to walk, I think."
1341,"01:09:12,646","01:09:14,880","Why is my car seat
in there, then?"
1342,"01:09:14,882","01:09:16,348","I just... I don't know,"
1343,"01:09:16,350","01:09:17,717","I put it in there
just in case."
1344,"01:09:17,719","01:09:19,451","But I can pick
the car up later."
1345,"01:09:19,453","01:09:20,820","- Come on.
- No,"
1346,"01:09:20,822","01:09:22,291",I'll take it.
1347,"01:09:23,457","01:09:25,892",You'll take the convertible?
1348,"01:09:25,894","01:09:27,626",Yeah.
1349,"01:09:27,628","01:09:29,728","What about all the stats
you told me about?"
1350,"01:09:29,730","01:09:31,731",Sometimes I got to let go
1351,"01:09:31,733","01:09:33,333","and walk on the wild side,"
1352,"01:09:33,335","01:09:34,968","right, Dad?"
1353,"01:09:34,970","01:09:37,740","Trusting everything's
going to be okay."
1354,"01:09:41,576","01:09:44,646","You are
something else, Billy."
1355,"01:09:47,314","01:09:49,781","What kind of... what kind of
music you want to listen to?"
1356,"01:09:49,783","01:09:51,817","Well, the only one
there is, country!"

just stopped"
1423,"01:14:43,310","01:14:46,946","and everyone just walked
off the dance floor?"

- Go. Go. Go. Go."
1443,"01:16:31,418","01:16:32,751","We're all about
to sit down and eat."
1444,"01:16:32,753","01:16:34,085","We're hungry lions, man."
1445,"01:16:34,087","01:16:35,420","Yeah.
We're hungry lions."
1446,"01:16:35,422","01:16:37,089","- All right.
- All right."
1447,"01:16:37,091","01:16:39,357","Wait, wait, wait, wait.
You don't eat like that."
1448,"01:16:39,359","01:16:41,160","You got to put
the blood on, nice."
1449,"01:16:41,162","01:16:42,894","I don't think it needs
too much blood."
1450,"01:16:42,896","01:16:45,263","It needs some blood, I'm going
to put some blood on mine."
1451,"01:16:45,265","01:16:46,732","- And then you gotta...
- Smear it around."
1452,"01:16:46,734","01:16:49,300","And then you got
to smooth it around like that,"
1453,"01:16:49,302","01:16:51,303","and then you're going
to hold it in the middle"
1454,"01:16:51,305","01:16:52,671","like this,"
1455,"01:16:52,673","01:16:53,772","and then you're going
to"
1456,"01:16:53,774","01:16:55,107",eat it like a lion.
1457,"01:16:58,680","01:17:00,345","We're the kings
of the jungle right now."
1458,"01:17:00,347","01:17:01,981","- We're the only...

1461,"01:17:04,752","01:17:06,451","- Delicious.
- Hmm."
1462,"01:17:06,453","01:17:08,420","- What's up man?
- Grab a beer, man."

1470,"01:17:19,867","01:17:21,467","Hey, it's going to be okay,
Billy, I got you."
1471,"01:17:21,469","01:17:23,102","- ...Billy's choking.

1478,"01:17:30,478","01:17:31,910","Come on baby, breathe."
1479,"01:17:31,912","01:17:33,446","Jake, it's not working."
1480,"01:17:33,448","01:17:34,714","- She's not breathing.
- I've got it, okay?"
1481,"01:17:34,716","01:17:35,880","Jake, you have
to do something."
1482,"01:17:35,882","01:17:37,249","Okay. I got this, okay!"
1483,"01:17:37,251","01:17:38,817","- Calm down.
- Come on baby, breathe."
1484,"01:17:38,819","01:17:40,119","Come on, you got this.

1487,"01:17:42,989","01:17:44,723","All right.
One more, come on."
1488,"01:17:44,725","01:17:46,959","Julie, give her
10 CCs of epi and push it."
1489,"01:17:46,961","01:17:48,861","Come on, Billy, not yet."
1490,"01:17:48,863","01:17:50,929","Liam, sweetie,"
1491,"01:17:50,931","01:17:53,165","would you go

1492,"01:17:53,167","01:17:54,400",Liam?
1493,"01:17:54,402","01:17:55,901","Sweetie, I need you
to go get your dad."
1494,"01:17:55,903","01:17:57,769","I think he went
down the hall."
1495,"01:17:57,771","01:17:59,504",Go get your daddy for me.
1496,"01:17:59,506","01:18:01,173","Julie, just take him
to see his dad."
1497,"01:18:01,175","01:18:03,108","I don't want him
to see this."
1498,"01:18:03,110","01:18:05,143","Come on, Billy Anne Page,"

1513,"01:18:33,875","01:18:35,307","She's all right.
She's all right."
1514,"01:18:35,309","01:18:37,543",She'll be just fine.
1515,"01:18:37,545","01:18:41,246","- Mama, I love you.

I only sing in this bar."

1542,"01:20:08,269","01:20:11,437","But it was you

1548,"01:20:29,556","01:20:31,190","All right, son."
1549,"01:20:31,192","01:20:32,293",Take it easy.
1550,"01:20:34,427","01:20:35,593","How you doing, Jake?"
1551,"01:20:35,595","01:20:37,562","Good, Walt. Yourself?"

1553,"01:20:39,300","01:20:42,334","You know,
I had a feeling you'd be here."
1554,"01:20:42,336","01:20:43,501","Hey, Freddy,"
1555,"01:20:43,503","01:20:45,506","- can I get a beer?
- Yeah."
1556,"01:20:57,083","01:20:59,218","So you think
you're ready to be a dad"
1557,"01:20:59,220","01:21:02,220","because you spent a couple
of weeks playing house?"
1558,"01:21:02,222","01:21:05,089","- Uh-hmm.
- No."
1559,"01:21:05,091","01:21:07,492","My little niece
was choking"
1560,"01:21:07,494","01:21:09,463","and you just
sat there, Liam."
1561,"01:21:11,198","01:21:12,563","I mean,
she could've died"
1562,"01:21:12,565","01:21:14,101","if she'd been alone
with you."
1563,"01:21:15,636","01:21:19,074","Man, you got to be on 24/7
when you're a parent, Liam."
1564,"01:21:22,042","01:21:24,977",You think you're equipped
1565,"01:21:24,979","01:21:28,083","to keep that little girl
alive every day?"
1566,"01:21:32,086","01:21:33,421",Yeah.
1567,"01:21:35,957","01:21:38,257",I ain't going to forget
1568,"01:21:38,259","01:21:41,727","all the bad years that Josie
had because of you, right?"
1569,"01:21:41,729","01:21:43,428",And I was there for her.
1570,"01:21:43,430","01:21:45,363","I'm the one that got her
through them."
1571,"01:21:45,365","01:21:49,201","Josie finally managed
to rebuild her life"
1572,"01:21:49,203","01:21:51,503","not just for her,
but for Billy, too."
1573,"01:21:51,505","01:21:53,973","Because you and I,
we both know"
1574,"01:21:53,975","01:21:56,578","that you're just going to find
some way to mess it up..."
1575,"01:22:00,981","01:22:03,018",and it'll destroy them.
1576,"01:22:11,759","01:22:15,693","You might have
everyone else in this town"
1577,"01:22:15,695","01:22:17,298","fooled right now, but..."
1578,"01:22:20,368","01:22:21,703",you ain't fooling me.
1579,"01:22:35,682","01:22:37,782","I can't believe
you smashed your hand"
1580,"01:22:37,784","01:22:40,152",through that bar mirror.
1581,"01:22:40,154","01:22:42,021",I'm almost done.
1582,"01:22:42,023","01:22:45,092","You'll be able to play again
in no time."
1583,"01:22:46,327","01:22:47,793",I never want to play again.
1584,"01:22:47,795","01:22:50,361","Now, don't say that.
Don't say that."
1585,"01:22:50,363","01:22:53,565","It's a God-given talent
to be able to play"
1586,"01:22:53,567","01:22:54,799",and sing the way you do.
1587,"01:22:54,801","01:22:56,570",I don't deserve it.
1588,"01:23:01,242","01:23:02,607",Let's face it.
1589,"01:23:02,609","01:23:04,442",Just be honest.
1590,"01:23:04,444","01:23:05,811","I'm a bad person, Dad."
1591,"01:23:05,813","01:23:07,812","- Liam.
- Come on, it's okay."
1592,"01:23:07,814","01:23:09,248",It's true.
1593,"01:23:09,250","01:23:11,586","We've... we've all
forgiven you, son."
1594,"01:23:13,154","01:23:14,422",You shouldn't have.
1595,"01:23:18,591","01:23:20,094",I'm sorry.
1596,"01:23:26,199","01:23:29,668",I'm sorry that I left you.
1597,"01:23:29,670","01:23:32,539","I'm sorry that I didn't
get in touch with you."
1598,"01:23:34,175","01:23:36,244","Honest, I don't
know why I did it."
1599,"01:23:39,079","01:23:40,411",I know.
1600,"01:23:40,413","01:23:41,479",I know.
1601,"01:23:41,481","01:23:43,650",The further away I went...
1602,"01:23:46,220","01:23:48,222",the longer I was gone...
1603,"01:23:49,789","01:23:51,993","the more pain I was in, Dad."
1604,"01:23:55,863","01:23:57,262",I'm sorry.
1605,"01:23:57,264","01:23:59,363",I know you are.
1606,"01:23:59,365","01:24:01,333","I just didn't know
how to get out."
1607,"01:24:01,335","01:24:02,470",I know.
1608,"01:24:09,275","01:24:12,477","You know,
when your mom died, son,"
1609,"01:24:12,479","01:24:14,615","I was so stuck
in my own grief..."
1610,"01:24:16,783","01:24:19,186",somehow I overlooked yours.
1611,"01:24:21,322","01:24:23,655","I got comforting words
for everyone in this town"
1612,"01:24:23,657","01:24:27,226","during their time
of need but..."
1613,"01:24:27,228","01:24:30,164","I wasn't able to talk
to my own son during his."
1614,"01:24:38,639","01:24:40,371","That wound,"
1615,"01:24:40,373","01:24:43,842","that terrible wound,"
1616,"01:24:43,844","01:24:47,411","losing your mom the way you did
at such a young age."
1617,"01:24:47,413","01:24:50,883","I think being famous
just fed that pain,"
1618,"01:24:50,885","01:24:53,320","knocked down everything
in its path."
1619,"01:25:02,462","01:25:05,132","So I'm the one
who's sorry, Liam."
1620,"01:25:06,167","01:25:08,700","I'm so, so sorry."

the best set"

you perform."

these new songs of yours,"
1675,"01:29:12,712","01:29:15,914","they're just crushing it,
you know?"
1676,"01:29:15,916","01:29:17,885","Just get me
out of here, Sam."

doing this to yourself?"
1680,"01:30:08,702","01:30:10,134",What?
1681,"01:30:10,136","01:30:11,702","What the heck happened
while you were home?"
1682,"01:30:11,704","01:30:13,604","She almost died

1684,"01:30:15,007","01:30:16,443",Billy.
1685,"01:30:18,845","01:30:20,678","Man, we were...
we were all about"
1686,"01:30:20,680","01:30:22,214","to have dinner
in the backyard"
1687,"01:30:22,216","01:30:24,648",and Billy started choking
1688,"01:30:24,650","01:30:26,750","and I just... I froze, man."
1689,"01:30:26,752","01:30:29,620",I was paralyzed by it.
1690,"01:30:29,622","01:30:33,124","I'm not... I'm not
a fully formed human being, Sam."

1692,"01:30:34,494","01:30:37,762","Liam, you froze with Billy"

1694,"01:30:42,970","01:30:44,669","She could've died, Sam."
1695,"01:30:44,671","01:30:47,938","But she didn't die, Liam."
1696,"01:30:47,940","01:30:50,875","And look, we all mess up
sometimes, Liam,"
1697,"01:30:50,877","01:30:52,009",but it's what you do
1698,"01:30:52,011","01:30:53,644","after you mess up
that counts."
1699,"01:30:53,646","01:30:54,979","You show up,"
1700,"01:30:54,981","01:30:56,484",you be there.
1701,"01:30:57,917","01:30:59,550","Now, you know what?"
1702,"01:30:59,552","01:31:01,018","This whole time
I managed you,"
1703,"01:31:01,020","01:31:03,287","you ain't been nothing
but a big, fat idiot."
1704,"01:31:03,289","01:31:04,623","- You know that?
- Yeah."
1705,"01:31:04,625","01:31:05,956","Yeah, it's true."
1706,"01:31:05,958","01:31:07,791",And I get it. I do.
1707,"01:31:07,793","01:31:10,629","There are far better men
than you out there, no doubt."
1708,"01:31:10,631","01:31:11,699",Uh-hmm.
1709,"01:31:14,167","01:31:16,701","But Josie
doesn't love them, Liam."
1710,"01:31:16,703","01:31:18,736",She loves you.
1711,"01:31:18,738","01:31:21,071","And lucky for her, man,"
1712,"01:31:21,073","01:31:23,677","you love her, too."
1713,"01:31:33,319","01:31:34,652","- Doris?
- Yeah."
1714,"01:31:34,654","01:31:35,986","I need to get off
this plane."
1715,"01:31:35,988","01:31:38,322","- You're what?
- I need to get off this plane."
1716,"01:31:38,324","01:31:41,058","Can you ask the pilot
to stay put, please?"
1717,"01:31:41,060","01:31:42,561","- No, no, no.
- Tell the pilot..."
1718,"01:31:42,563","01:31:44,228","You tell the pilot to go,"
1719,"01:31:44,230","01:31:45,996",to fly away.
1720,"01:31:45,998","01:31:47,598","You know that we are supposed
to leave right now,"
1721,"01:31:47,600","01:31:49,668","so we are going right now
into the air."
1722,"01:31:49,670","01:31:51,303","Can you just ask
the pilot to open the door?"
1723,"01:31:51,305","01:31:53,571","You tell the pilot
that you are locking the doors"
1724,"01:31:53,573","01:31:55,839","- and we are taking off.
- I need to get off this plane."
1725,"01:31:55,841","01:31:56,942","You are not getting off
this plane."
1726,"01:31:56,944","01:31:58,343","I'm getting off
this plane."
1727,"01:31:58,345","01:32:00,844","You are performing
in Berlin in 14 hours."
1728,"01:32:00,846","01:32:03,080","In 14 hours, I'm going
to be in Louisiana."
1729,"01:32:03,082","01:32:05,717","- All right.
- For the love of God,"
1730,"01:32:05,719","01:32:07,652",do not get off this plane.
1731,"01:32:07,654","01:32:10,754","April 9th,
one saved message."
1732,"01:32:10,756","01:32:12,991","Hi, Liam.
It's me, Josie."
1733,"01:32:12,993","01:32:16,361","I've called you so many times
I've lost count."
1734,"01:32:16,363","01:32:19,330","I still don't know why
you left me on our wedding day,"
1735,"01:32:19,332","01:32:22,366","and I don't know
if I'll ever find out."
1736,"01:32:22,368","01:32:25,937","But I really need you
to call me back."
1737,"01:32:25,939","01:32:27,772","If you don't,
I promised myself"
1738,"01:32:27,774","01:32:29,577","that I'll never call
you again."
1739,"01:32:31,211","01:32:33,780","I have to find some way
to move on with my life."
1740,"01:32:35,015","01:32:37,848",But I want you to know
1741,"01:32:37,850","01:32:40,986","if I don't ever
hear back from you,"
1742,"01:32:40,988","01:32:44,022","I will
always love you, Liam."
1743,"01:32:44,024","01:32:47,826","You will always be
the one for me."
1744,"01:32:47,828","01:32:49,931","And you'll have my heart
forever."
1745,"01:33:09,850","01:33:12,119","Hey, it's Josie.
Leave a message."
1746,"01:33:15,822","01:33:18,726","Hey, Josie."
1747,"01:33:20,092","01:33:21,127",It's me.
1748,"01:33:23,229","01:33:25,362",It's taken me eight years
1749,"01:33:25,364","01:33:27,134",to return this message.
1750,"01:33:29,802","01:33:32,303","I mean, I always wanted to,"
1751,"01:33:32,305","01:33:36,941","but I knew that I needed to know
how to tell you"
1752,"01:33:36,943","01:33:39,146",why I did what I did.
1753,"01:33:40,747","01:33:43,748",And I haven't figured it out...
1754,"01:33:43,750","01:33:44,885",until now.
1755,"01:33:47,753","01:33:49,920","See, my mom
was the love of my life"
1756,"01:33:49,922","01:33:51,224",until I met you.
1757,"01:33:53,859","01:33:55,195",And...
1758,"01:33:56,262","01:33:57,829",I know we were young
1759,"01:33:57,831","01:34:01,232","but the thought of possibly
losing you one day"
1760,"01:34:01,234","01:34:03,004",the way that I lost her...
1761,"01:34:04,904","01:34:06,437","I thought my heart
couldn't take it,"
1762,"01:34:06,439","01:34:08,775",so I ran.
1763,"01:34:11,478","01:34:14,015","But I can
never move on, Josie."
1764,"01:34:15,748","01:34:18,116","And that message
that you left me,"
1765,"01:34:18,118","01:34:20,919",I did listen to it.
1766,"01:34:20,921","01:34:23,691","I listened to it every day
for the last eight years."
1767,"01:34:25,425","01:34:27,959","And then when I met Billy,"
1768,"01:34:27,961","01:34:31,896",my heart just burst open.
1769,"01:34:31,898","01:34:35,366","I thought I wasn't good enough
for you two."
1770,"01:34:35,368","01:34:37,736","But I'm gonna spend
the rest of my life"
1771,"01:34:37,738","01:34:39,903",trying to be.
1772,"01:34:44,444","01:34:47,378","I'm never leaving
Saint again without you"
1773,"01:34:47,380","01:34:49,717",and Billy by my side.
1774,"01:34:54,186","01:34:56,423",Josie!
1775,"01:34:57,858","01:34:59,726",Josie!
1776,"01:35:01,293","01:35:03,327",You're the one.
1777,"01:35:03,329","01:35:05,231",You've always been the one.
1778,"01:36:04,024","01:36:07,058","So you've been carrying around
this old beat-up,"
1779,"01:36:07,060","01:36:10,061","duct-taped,
really ugly cell phone"
1780,"01:36:10,063","01:36:11,865","the past eight years
because of me?"
1781,"01:36:13,934","01:36:15,168",Yeah.
1782,"01:36:18,003","01:36:20,205","And you really listened
to that message"
1783,"01:36:20,207","01:36:22,977","every single day
since I left it there?"
1784,"01:36:24,476","01:36:25,813",Yeah.
1785,"01:36:27,613","01:36:29,880","And you're not ever
leaving Saint again"
1786,"01:36:29,882","01:36:31,184",without Billy or me?
1787,"01:36:33,587","01:36:35,586",Never.
1788,"01:36:35,588","01:36:38,057",Then I just wanted to say...
1789,"01:36:42,863","01:36:44,064",welcome home.
1790,"01:37:17,229","01:37:19,030","Hey, I'm Jake."
1791,"01:37:19,032","01:37:20,598","Hi, I'm Doris."
1792,"01:37:20,600","01:37:22,666","Well, it's nice
to meet you, Doris."
1793,"01:37:22,668","01:37:24,402","You smell good, Jake."
1794,"01:37:28,140","01:37:30,674","Yeah, woo."
1795,"01:37:30,676","01:37:32,977","Go, Billy."
1796,"01:37:32,979","01:37:34,280",Yeah.
1797,"01:37:38,484","01:37:40,384","- Woo.
- Woo, Billy."
1798,"01:37:40,386","01:37:41,919",Woo.
