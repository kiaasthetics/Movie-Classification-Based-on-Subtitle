cyber-enhanced."
122,"00:16:30,040","00:16:31,359",So how did they hack him?
123,"00:16:31,440","00:16:34,273","Somehow this geisha bot
got past his encryption."
124,"00:16:34,600","00:16:36,192",Something's different.

144,"00:17:35,320","00:17:38,471","All showed signs
of cerebral hacking."
145,"00:17:39,480","00:17:41,152",The same as the geisha did to Osmond.
146,"00:17:42,240","00:17:45,789","And all were
senior figures at Hanka,"

199,"00:21:43,880","00:21:45,552","Open and close, please."
200,"00:21:47,400","00:21:49,834","You have damaged
internal systems."
201,"00:21:49,920","00:21:52,354","Maybe next time,
you can design me better."
202,"00:21:56,080","00:21:57,080",How are you?
203,"00:21:57,200","00:21:58,440","I'm fine.
I can't feel anything."
204,"00:21:58,480","00:22:01,233","No, you. In there."
205,"00:22:02,720","00:22:04,836",I've been having glitches.
206,"00:22:05,600","00:22:06,953",But they'll pass.
207,"00:22:07,560","00:22:08,920","You've been
taking your medication?"
208,"00:22:09,200","00:22:10,394",Yeah.
209,"00:22:10,760","00:22:12,080",But these ones are still cycling.
210,"00:22:12,640","00:22:13,914",I had two this morning.
211,"00:22:14,240","00:22:16,595","- Sound or image?
- Both."
212,"00:22:20,240","00:22:21,753",I see it.
213,"00:22:22,880","00:22:24,996","Have you made
any unencrypted downloads?"
214,"00:22:25,080","00:22:27,469","- No. Just delete them for me.
- Consent?"
215,"00:22:27,560","00:22:28,959","My name is Major Mira Killian,"
216,"00:22:29,040","00:22:31,429","and I give my consent
to delete this data."
217,"00:22:32,200","00:22:33,269",It's done.
218,"00:22:33,800","00:22:35,677","- No big deal.
- What are they?"
219,"00:22:36,920","00:22:39,718","Sensory echoes from
your mind. Shadows."
220,"00:22:39,800","00:22:40,949",Can't be sure.
221,"00:22:41,200","00:22:43,000","How do you know
what's a glitch and what's me?"
222,"00:22:43,280","00:22:45,953","The glitches have
a different texture"
223,"00:22:46,280","00:22:48,191",to the rest of your code.
224,"00:22:50,600","00:22:52,192",I can see everything.
225,"00:22:53,640","00:22:56,791","All of your thoughts,
your decisions."
226,"00:22:57,400","00:22:59,072",I guess privacy is just for humans.
227,"00:22:59,160","00:23:00,832",You are human.
228,"00:23:02,400","00:23:04,197",People see you as human.
229,"00:23:04,400","00:23:06,868",Everyone around me seems to fit.
230,"00:23:07,200","00:23:10,636","They seem connected
to something, something I am"
231,"00:23:11,160","00:23:12,479",not.
232,"00:23:14,400","00:23:15,469",It's like I have no past.
233,"00:23:15,560","00:23:16,959",Of course you have a past.
234,"00:23:17,160","00:23:19,176","And with time you'll feel
more and more connected to it,"
235,"00:23:19,200","00:23:20,553",and to them.
236,"00:23:24,280","00:23:25,429","Open and close, please."
237,"00:23:35,080","00:23:38,516","We cling to memories
as if they define us,"
238,"00:23:39,800","00:23:41,279",but they really don't.
239,"00:23:42,640","00:23:45,108",What we do is what defines us.
240,"00:23:47,760","00:23:50,320",You are entering a Hanka secure area.
241,"00:23:50,400","00:23:51,992",Authorized personnel only.
242,"00:23:52,560","00:23:55,711","Please disable
communication enhancements."
243,"00:23:56,000","00:23:57,149",I'm busy.
244,"00:23:57,240","00:23:59,629","Dr. Dahlin!
Are you finished yet?"
245,"00:24:00,320","00:24:02,356","If you hadn't riddled
the geisha with bullets,"
246,"00:24:02,440","00:24:03,589",this would be much easier.
247,"00:24:03,680","00:24:06,035","- I didn't shoot her.
- I did."
248,"00:24:06,200","00:24:09,192",This is gonna take days.
249,"00:24:09,960","00:24:12,428","I need to run hundreds
of potential simulations."
250,"00:24:12,520","00:24:13,520",We don't have the time.
251,"00:24:17,120","00:24:19,315",She was a Hanka companion bot.
252,"00:24:20,880","00:24:23,553","But she was reprogramed
for cerebral hacking."
253,"00:24:24,760","00:24:26,432",What was on her drives?
254,"00:24:26,600","00:24:27,600",Nothing.
255,"00:24:28,080","00:24:29,911","The data was destroyed
as it was transmitted."
256,"00:24:30,880","00:24:32,871",No sign what she was after.
257,"00:24:33,320","00:24:35,390",The hardware was vandalized.
258,"00:24:36,040","00:24:37,792",They ripped her up!
259,"00:24:38,240","00:24:39,559",Then I have to do a Deep Dive.
260,"00:24:40,720","00:24:43,234","You can't encrypt
during a Deep Dive."
261,"00:24:43,400","00:24:44,719",I know.
262,"00:24:46,240","00:24:48,196",They could have left traps in her.
263,"00:24:48,280","00:24:50,714",Mag pulses. Viruses.
264,"00:24:50,920","00:24:52,069",She's right.
265,"00:24:52,800","00:24:55,360","You'll be exposing your mind
to whoever hacked her."
266,"00:24:55,560","00:24:56,879",You'll be wide open.
267,"00:25:00,160","00:25:02,116","I have to get
inside her memory."
268,"00:25:02,320","00:25:04,038",It's the fastest way to find Kuze.
269,"00:25:10,320","00:25:11,912",It's too dangerous.
270,"00:25:12,120","00:25:14,315",And highly irresponsible.
271,"00:25:19,520","00:25:20,839",Are you sure?
272,"00:25:21,720","00:25:23,676","You see any bad code
headed my way, pull me out."
273,"00:25:27,440","00:25:28,720","How come you're
the one sweating?"
274,"00:25:37,640","00:25:38,640",Run it.
275,"00:25:47,480","00:25:49,630","Cyber-mind
connection to the Major"
276,"00:25:49,720","00:25:51,790",now active and unencrypted.
277,"00:25:54,120","00:25:56,111","Consent required
for data download."
278,"00:25:56,320","00:25:59,471","My name is Major Mira Killian,
and I give my consent."
279,"00:26:21,920","00:26:23,840",Thank you.
280,"00:27:40,040","00:27:41,519","Disconnect.
Get her out."
281,"00:27:41,880","00:27:42,880",Get her out!
282,"00:27:42,960","00:27:45,030","I'm trying,
but she's being hacked."
283,"00:27:48,640","00:27:49,914",Get her out now!
284,"00:27:53,480","00:27:54,549",Now!
285,"00:27:55,560","00:27:57,710",Are you okay?
286,"00:28:00,680","00:28:02,193",I know where he is.
287,"00:28:16,400","00:28:17,628",I know this place.
288,"00:28:18,000","00:28:20,116",They run black market mech.
289,"00:28:21,200","00:28:22,792","- You tooled up?
- Yep."
290,"00:28:23,160","00:28:25,230","Target's the basement.
I'll lead."
291,"00:28:25,320","00:28:27,038",Switching to mind-comms.
292,"00:28:27,640","00:28:30,279","- Hope you've been practicing.
- That's unfair."
293,"00:28:31,840","00:28:33,956",It just takes me a moment to
294,"00:28:34,120","00:28:35,553",get the hang of it.
295,"00:28:45,400","00:28:48,790","Two mercs at the doors.
Armed and enhanced."
296,"00:28:49,240","00:28:51,708","Copy that.
We've got it covered."
297,"00:29:02,400","00:29:04,480","There's a lot
of heat in here for a nightclub."
298,"00:29:04,680","00:29:07,911","It's a Yakuza club.
What did you expect?"
299,"00:29:08,240","00:29:09,673",I quite like the place.
300,"00:29:10,080","00:29:11,991","Why doesn't
that surprise me?"
301,"00:29:12,680","00:29:14,591","I'm gonna have to
draw some attention,"
302,"00:29:14,680","00:29:16,910","see if I can access
the basement that way."
303,"00:29:20,840","00:29:22,876","You're not here
looking for any trouble, are you?"
304,"00:29:22,960","00:29:26,191","I'm just here for
the girls and the beer."
305,"00:29:29,400","00:29:31,834","- Can I help you?
- I'm looking for someone."
306,"00:29:32,080","00:29:33,433",You been here before?
307,"00:29:33,520","00:29:36,273","My friend had some mech work
done here. Industry stuff."
308,"00:29:36,360","00:29:37,952",We don't do mech work here.
309,"00:29:38,680","00:29:40,079",My mistake.
310,"00:29:40,680","00:29:42,477","Why don't you come
have fun with us?"
311,"00:29:42,560","00:29:43,993",We'll have some privacy.
312,"00:29:52,040","00:29:53,075",I'm in.
313,"00:29:53,840","00:29:55,478","I'll be here
when you need me."
314,"00:30:07,960","00:30:09,279","You say your friend
worked here?"
315,"00:30:09,360","00:30:12,079","I said my friend
had work done here."
316,"00:30:13,240","00:30:14,559",She's human?
317,"00:30:15,200","00:30:16,599",Your friend.
318,"00:30:17,080","00:30:19,230",Now what's that supposed to mean?
319,"00:30:19,320","00:30:20,389",Batou.
320,"00:30:20,920","00:30:22,035",Can you hear me?
321,"00:30:22,120","00:30:26,113","Who did this
stunning work on you?"
322,"00:30:26,480","00:30:27,879",It's divine.
323,"00:30:34,920","00:30:36,148",Ladriya. Guns.
324,"00:30:37,280","00:30:38,474",Here.
325,"00:30:41,520","00:30:43,351","Batou, I'm losing signal."
326,"00:30:43,520","00:30:45,511","Don't worry, sweetie."
327,"00:30:46,440","00:30:47,919",We have privacy.
328,"00:30:49,480","00:30:50,515",Listen.
329,"00:30:51,160","00:30:53,469",No signals going in or out.
330,"00:30:54,520","00:30:57,193","Major, I'm in position.
Do you copy?"
331,"00:30:58,120","00:30:59,120",Beer.
332,"00:31:00,960","00:31:03,599","If you don't answer,
you're gonna hurt my feelings."
333,"00:31:11,440","00:31:13,908","Ladriya, do you have Major
on comms?"
334,"00:31:14,000","00:31:16,639","Got nothing.
Signal's still blocked."
335,"00:31:17,120","00:31:19,793","I'm afraid I get
bored rather easily, so,"
336,"00:31:20,480","00:31:22,072","if you don't want to talk,"
337,"00:31:23,800","00:31:25,950",maybe you want to dance!
338,"00:31:28,480","00:31:30,471","Major, come on.
Answer me."
339,"00:31:46,600","00:31:48,477",I thought you said no trouble.
340,"00:31:48,680","00:31:50,520",Dance.
341,"00:31:52,440","00:31:55,079",No! Enough!
342,"00:31:57,160","00:31:58,309",The truth is...
343,"00:31:58,520","00:31:59,839",Hmm.
344,"00:31:59,960","00:32:01,632",...I wasn't built to dance.
345,"00:32:55,880","00:32:58,917","Back on comms.
I'm heading to the back room."
346,"00:32:59,240","00:33:02,312","I missed you.
I'll meet you there."
347,"00:33:33,920","00:33:37,435","Collaborate with Hanka Robotics
and be destroyed."
348,"00:33:47,760","00:33:49,273",Major?
349,"00:33:52,720","00:33:54,915",Hey.
350,"00:34:22,200","00:34:23,679",Where's Batou?
351,"00:34:24,240","00:34:27,471","In Enhancement
next door. He's doing well."
352,"00:34:29,360","00:34:31,669",You took most of the blast.
353,"00:34:34,520","00:34:36,431",I saw him down there.
354,"00:34:38,240","00:34:39,753",It was like...
355,"00:34:41,240","00:34:43,231",...he waited to see me.
356,"00:34:44,240","00:34:45,958",We synaptic-scanned you.
357,"00:34:46,040","00:34:49,510","Everything you witnessed
went to Section 9 to evaluate."
358,"00:34:52,160","00:34:54,116","You know, the scan"
359,"00:34:54,200","00:34:56,668","also turned up
a number of glitches."
360,"00:34:57,880","00:34:59,836",They've been getting worse.
361,"00:35:01,280","00:35:02,599",Since when?
362,"00:35:03,600","00:35:05,033",Since the Deep Dive.
363,"00:35:21,680","00:35:24,399","Do any of the glitches
mean something to you?"
364,"00:35:25,880","00:35:27,029",No.
365,"00:35:28,040","00:35:29,040",They don't.
366,"00:35:31,360","00:35:34,079","You've been inside
the same shell as he has."
367,"00:35:34,720","00:35:38,793","That could have
very serious consequences."
368,"00:35:39,720","00:35:42,951","You were not authorized
to Deep Dive the geisha."
369,"00:35:43,960","00:35:45,552",You're disappointed.
370,"00:35:47,160","00:35:48,991","No, I'm worried."
371,"00:35:51,480","00:35:53,232",You're not invulnerable.
372,"00:35:54,240","00:35:57,835","I can repair your body,
but I can't protect your mind."
373,"00:35:58,440","00:35:59,839",Why not?
374,"00:36:03,160","00:36:05,469","You can see all my thoughts,"
375,"00:36:06,200","00:36:08,077","so you should be
able to secure them."
376,"00:36:09,440","00:36:12,591","Try and understand
your importance, Mira."
377,"00:36:15,520","00:36:18,512","You're what everyone
will become one day."
378,"00:36:21,560","00:36:24,438","You don't know how alone
that makes me feel."
379,"00:36:42,120","00:36:43,792","I can see you out there,
you know."
380,"00:36:46,640","00:36:48,471","How many fingers
am I holding up?"
381,"00:36:48,760","00:36:50,671",Funny.
382,"00:37:00,120","00:37:02,315",Say something nice.
383,"00:37:03,280","00:37:05,157",You chose those?
384,"00:37:05,520","00:37:07,158",They're tactical.
385,"00:37:07,920","00:37:10,912","- Always for the job.
- What else I got?"
386,"00:37:11,680","00:37:13,636","- They suit you.
- Yeah?"
387,"00:37:13,880","00:37:16,474","I got night-vision, mile-zoom,"
388,"00:37:16,960","00:37:18,075",and X-ray.
389,"00:37:19,720","00:37:21,438",I guess I see like you now.
390,"00:37:22,200","00:37:24,634","Don't worry.
You'll get used to it."
391,"00:37:27,240","00:37:28,992",Thanks for saving my ass.
392,"00:37:29,920","00:37:31,956",Glad to see you're okay.
393,"00:37:32,600","00:37:33,749",Major?
394,"00:37:35,080","00:37:37,196",Could you feed the dogs for me?
395,"00:37:38,640","00:37:39,993",I don't want to scare them.
396,"00:37:40,440","00:37:41,759",Anytime.
397,"00:38:25,640","00:38:28,677","Are you insufficiently funded,
Mr. Aramaki?"
398,"00:38:29,280","00:38:32,795","Is Section 9 missing some
critical operational resource?"
399,"00:38:36,320","00:38:38,456",Major is our most sophisticated weapon
400,"00:38:38,480","00:38:40,391",only if she's intact.
401,"00:38:42,120","00:38:43,633",And Dr. Ouelet informed me
402,"00:38:43,720","00:38:46,871","that you let her dive
a corrupted geisha."
403,"00:38:55,440","00:38:57,158","You realize
the supreme importance"
404,"00:38:57,240","00:38:59,117","that Hanka represents
to this government."
405,"00:39:00,440","00:39:03,079",Major is the future of my company.
406,"00:39:03,720","00:39:06,393","If you compromise
her systems again,"
407,"00:39:07,120","00:39:09,031",I will burn this section.
408,"00:40:07,080","00:40:08,991",Come here. With me.
409,"00:40:10,000","00:40:12,150",Create your own beauty.
410,"00:40:12,240","00:40:13,912",Beauty enhanced.
411,"00:40:24,680","00:40:25,999",You human?
412,"00:40:27,720","00:40:28,835",Yeah.
413,"00:40:34,680","00:40:36,193",Can you take that off
414,"00:40:36,760","00:40:38,910",so I can see your face?
415,"00:41:04,720","00:41:06,472",What does that feel like?
416,"00:41:06,560","00:41:07,595",It feels
417,"00:41:08,280","00:41:09,759",different.
418,"00:41:21,080","00:41:22,672",What are you?
419,"00:41:59,200","00:42:00,235",Look at me.
420,"00:42:03,200","00:42:05,589","Tell me what
they took from me."
421,"00:42:07,480","00:42:10,119","I'm sorry.
They never told us."
422,"00:42:33,160","00:42:35,879","It feels weird
driving with these eyes."
423,"00:42:39,320","00:42:40,912",Why do you take that?
424,"00:42:41,000","00:42:44,117","It keeps my brain
from rejecting this body."
425,"00:42:46,320","00:42:48,675","Major, Batou, you need to get here."
426,"00:42:48,760","00:42:50,273",What have you got?
427,"00:42:50,360","00:42:52,749","Another Hanka
scientist has been found dead."
428,"00:42:52,880","00:42:54,108",It's Dahlin.
429,"00:42:54,560","00:42:55,560",Got it.
430,"00:43:02,920","00:43:04,478","Major, this way."
431,"00:43:34,080","00:43:35,149",What is that?
432,"00:43:36,920","00:43:39,514","She found what Kuze
stole from Osmond."
433,"00:43:40,360","00:43:45,275","It's a list of everyone who
worked on a project called 2571."
434,"00:43:45,360","00:43:46,952",That's who he's targeting.
435,"00:43:47,400","00:43:49,231",Is anyone else on the list?
436,"00:43:52,120","00:43:54,395",Find Ouelet. Now!
437,"00:43:54,560","00:43:57,632","She's in transit.
Her comms are down."
438,"00:44:02,240","00:44:04,276","I'm looking at her
and I'm thinking,"
439,"00:44:04,360","00:44:06,749","""You want me to pay for violin, too."""
440,"00:44:06,840","00:44:08,398",Don't get me wrong.
441,"00:44:09,240","00:44:11,231",I love that kid to pieces.
442,"00:44:11,440","00:44:13,317",I do. She's amazing.
443,"00:44:13,400","00:44:16,915","But when she practices that
thing, it is painful, right?"
444,"00:44:17,560","00:44:18,595",Why not piano?
445,"00:44:19,080","00:44:21,514","I mean,
it's the same price, you know?"
446,"00:44:21,600","00:44:23,352",And doesn't sound so bad.
447,"00:44:25,600","00:44:28,910","At least, if you can't
play that proper, it sounds..."
448,"00:45:17,560","00:45:20,120",2571. Tell me everything!
449,"00:45:32,160","00:45:34,196","Are you prepared
to die for 257..."
450,"00:45:43,200","00:45:44,269",Go!
451,"00:45:59,040","00:46:00,075",Go!
452,"00:47:57,960","00:47:58,960",Where's Kuze?
453,"00:47:59,400","00:48:00,833",Why does he want to kill Ouelet?
454,"00:48:00,920","00:48:02,069",I don't know anything.
455,"00:48:04,800","00:48:06,791",Enough! Enough!
456,"00:48:08,960","00:48:10,473",We need him alive.
457,"00:48:14,280","00:48:16,999","Please,
I've been through this."
458,"00:48:18,080","00:48:20,071",You have the wrong guy.
459,"00:48:21,240","00:48:23,549",So tell us who we do have.
460,"00:48:25,080","00:48:28,390",My name is Lee Cunningham.
461,"00:48:32,000","00:48:34,070","- Where'd you get the weapons?
- I don't know."
462,"00:48:34,160","00:48:35,336",Who loaded them onto the truck?
463,"00:48:35,360","00:48:37,874","I don't know anything about
weapons, all right? I told you!"
464,"00:48:37,960","00:48:40,315","I was picking up my daughter.
She takes violin lessons."
465,"00:48:40,400","00:48:41,833",What's her name?
466,"00:48:45,000","00:48:46,991","- Is this her?
- Yeah."
467,"00:48:48,200","00:48:50,031",Isn't she a little angel?
468,"00:48:50,120","00:48:51,792","- This is your daughter?
- Right."
469,"00:48:54,520","00:48:56,192",Do you have kids?
470,"00:48:59,680","00:49:01,352",Where do you live?
471,"00:49:03,200","00:49:04,713",I can't remember.
472,"00:49:04,800","00:49:08,076","I think it's a tall place.
Is it a tall building?"
473,"00:49:08,160","00:49:10,037","It's a tall place, right?"
474,"00:49:11,240","00:49:12,912",You don't have a child.
475,"00:49:15,760","00:49:18,069","You don't have a wife.
You live alone."
476,"00:49:18,160","00:49:19,957","- It's just you.
- What? No."
477,"00:49:20,040","00:49:21,696","We've been to your apartment.
There's nobody there."
478,"00:49:21,720","00:49:22,789","- No.
- You've lived there"
479,"00:49:22,880","00:49:23,976","- for 10 years by yourself.
- No!"
480,"00:49:24,000","00:49:25,000",So you're just lying.
481,"00:49:25,040","00:49:26,393",I'm not lying!
482,"00:49:27,520","00:49:29,476",I didn't kill anyone!
483,"00:49:29,560","00:49:31,949","- Why do you keep doing this to me?
- Holo cube disconnect."
484,"00:49:32,040","00:49:33,040",Please!
485,"00:49:33,840","00:49:35,831",I didn't do anything!
486,"00:49:36,200","00:49:37,952","Why do you keep
saying this to me?"
487,"00:49:38,040","00:49:39,792","I don't understand.
How can he not know?"
488,"00:49:41,200","00:49:44,875","The hack must have created
a vacuum. Kuze's wiped his memory"
489,"00:49:45,000","00:49:47,355","and somehow installed
a new reality."
490,"00:49:49,160","00:49:51,515","At least, he got to
believe he had a kid."
491,"00:49:52,600","00:49:54,477","What's the difference, huh?"
492,"00:49:55,880","00:49:57,757","Fantasy, reality."
493,"00:49:57,840","00:49:59,512","Dreams, memories."
494,"00:50:00,720","00:50:02,631",It's all the same.
495,"00:50:03,240","00:50:04,878",Just noise.
496,"00:50:06,560","00:50:07,560",It's him.
497,"00:50:10,640","00:50:12,119",He's in there.
498,"00:50:14,760","00:50:17,194","This cube is secure.
He can't be, Major."
499,"00:50:17,680","00:50:18,829",Lie detector.
500,"00:50:19,000","00:50:20,513",He must've hacked in that way.
501,"00:50:20,680","00:50:21,896","We should uplink to the machine,"
502,"00:50:21,920","00:50:23,416","trace the code,
get a lock on his location."
503,"00:50:23,440","00:50:24,475",Do it.
504,"00:50:24,760","00:50:27,115","Don't go in there.
It's too dangerous!"
505,"00:50:43,800","00:50:45,736","The signal's unstable.
Can you get a lock on it?"
506,"00:50:45,760","00:50:46,760",Think so.
507,"00:50:46,840","00:50:48,831","We gotta move fast.
We're losing it."
508,"00:50:49,000","00:50:50,228",Connecting.
509,"00:50:52,800","00:50:54,028",Who are you?
510,"00:50:57,120","00:50:58,473",Come here.
511,"00:51:00,760","00:51:02,113",I am shy.
512,"00:51:03,320","00:51:05,709",I'm not beautiful
513,"00:51:05,800","00:51:06,800",like you.
514,"00:51:10,040","00:51:11,996",Tell me who you are.
515,"00:51:12,280","00:51:15,192","I have been born
more than once."
516,"00:51:15,920","00:51:18,480",So I have more than one name.
517,"00:51:19,040","00:51:20,598",I'll find you.
518,"00:51:20,920","00:51:22,353",Not yet.
519,"00:51:23,160","00:51:24,673",I'm not done.
520,"00:51:24,920","00:51:27,036","The machine
is tracing his location."
521,"00:51:27,480","00:51:28,629",We got a fix!
522,"00:51:34,360","00:51:35,998",I need to see her.
523,"00:51:36,480","00:51:38,232","No, please. I know..."
524,"00:51:38,320","00:51:39,673",We got him.
525,"00:51:47,760","00:51:49,034",Let's go.
526,"00:52:03,280","00:52:04,679",Weapons up.
527,"00:52:07,280","00:52:08,918","- Go.
- On me."
528,"00:52:56,920","00:52:58,831",Stay down! Stay down!
529,"00:53:08,680","00:53:10,511","Put it down.
Put it down."
530,"00:53:17,640","00:53:18,640",Grenade!
531,"00:54:15,680","00:54:16,908",Major!
532,"00:54:17,440","00:54:18,759",Come in.
533,"00:54:19,920","00:54:21,911","I know why
we couldn't find him."
534,"00:54:25,000","00:54:28,197","He's using human minds
to create a network of his own."
535,"00:54:28,360","00:54:29,880",We're coming to your position.
536,"00:55:45,160","00:55:46,991",Tell me who you are.
537,"00:55:49,360","00:55:53,831","I am that
which you seek to destroy."
538,"00:55:57,520","00:56:00,114",In this life my name is
539,"00:56:01,120","00:56:02,120",Kuze.
540,"00:56:04,880","00:56:06,950",What are you doing to me?
541,"00:56:09,720","00:56:14,714","I have connected you
to a network of my own creation."
542,"00:56:15,040","00:56:17,270","When I am finished
in this world,"
543,"00:56:17,800","00:56:22,112","my ghost can survive there
and regenerate."
544,"00:56:22,600","00:56:24,750",What do you want from me?
545,"00:56:25,840","00:56:27,398",I became
546,"00:56:27,480","00:56:30,119","fascinated with you,"
547,"00:56:31,640","00:56:34,029",reading your code
548,"00:56:34,160","00:56:36,628","while you were inside
that geisha."
549,"00:56:39,240","00:56:42,949","Like nothing
I had felt before and yet so"
550,"00:56:43,800","00:56:45,233",familiar.
551,"00:56:47,640","00:56:48,914",We are the same.
552,"00:56:50,200","00:56:51,997",We are not the same.
553,"00:56:54,320","00:56:56,311",You kill innocent people.
554,"00:56:56,880","00:56:59,314","""Innocent"",
is that what you call them?"
555,"00:57:00,200","00:57:02,634",I am as they made me.
556,"00:57:03,840","00:57:05,239",Who made you?
557,"00:57:05,320","00:57:07,356",What have they told you?
558,"00:57:07,840","00:57:09,956",That you were the first?
559,"00:57:10,400","00:57:12,994",The first cerebral salvage?
560,"00:57:14,040","00:57:17,589",You were born of lessons took
561,"00:57:17,680","00:57:19,477",from my failure.
562,"00:57:21,120","00:57:23,475",What are you talking about?
563,"00:57:24,600","00:57:27,353","I was conscious
while they dismembered"
564,"00:57:27,480","00:57:29,675",my body and discarded me
565,"00:57:29,800","00:57:31,870",like garbage.
566,"00:57:32,760","00:57:35,558","I was lying on a table,"
567,"00:57:35,800","00:57:38,394","listening to doctors
talk about how"
568,"00:57:38,520","00:57:41,114","my mind had not meshed
with the shell"
569,"00:57:41,200","00:57:42,713",that they had built.
570,"00:57:44,040","00:57:47,635",How Project 2571
571,"00:57:47,720","00:57:49,073","had failed,"
572,"00:57:49,920","00:57:51,831",and they had to move on
573,"00:57:58,040","00:57:59,393",to you.
574,"00:58:06,560","00:58:08,915",What a beauty you are.
575,"00:58:12,160","00:58:14,469",They have improved us so much

a part of their evolution,"
578,"00:58:24,200","00:58:26,714",but they have created us
579,"00:58:26,800","00:58:29,189","to evolve alone,"
580,"00:58:34,280","00:58:35,599",beyond them.

that's what you call"

585,"00:58:46,480","00:58:49,358",They tried to kill me first.
586,"00:58:51,000","00:58:53,309",It is self-defense.

591,"00:59:06,040","00:59:07,473",I won't let that happen.
592,"00:59:09,800","00:59:11,472",You want to kill me?
593,"00:59:15,880","00:59:17,871",Like everyone else.
594,"00:59:24,480","00:59:25,959",Do it then.
595,"00:59:29,200","00:59:31,316","Do what you were
programed to do."
596,"00:59:43,280","00:59:44,508",What is that?
597,"00:59:56,560","00:59:58,152",What is that?
598,"00:59:59,680","01:00:03,753","I can't remember,
but I am haunted by it."
599,"01:00:04,920","01:00:06,433",Do you see it?
600,"01:00:11,920","01:00:12,920",Togusa!
601,"01:00:18,160","01:00:22,312","Don't take the medication
that they give you."
602,"01:00:22,960","01:00:25,713","They use it to suppress
your memories."
603,"01:00:26,240","01:00:30,028","Your shell belongs to them,
but not your ghost."
604,"01:00:30,720","01:00:32,358",Your ghost is yours.
605,"01:00:32,880","01:00:34,313","Remember that,"
606,"01:00:34,440","01:00:37,557",and maybe you can remember it all.
607,"01:00:45,840","01:00:48,354","Get away from her!
Get down on the ground, now!"
608,"01:00:54,320","01:00:55,548",Major!
609,"01:01:04,480","01:01:05,833",Major!
610,"01:01:24,320","01:01:25,912","Oh, Mira."
611,"01:01:26,360","01:01:28,476","Oh, my God, you're safe!"
612,"01:01:30,440","01:01:32,749",You've been gone for hours!
613,"01:01:33,800","01:01:36,109",No one knew where you were.
614,"01:01:41,040","01:01:42,189",What?
615,"01:01:44,440","01:01:46,112",You're scaring me.
616,"01:01:49,120","01:01:50,439",Calm down.
617,"01:01:54,480","01:01:56,835",How many were there before me?
618,"01:01:59,480","01:02:03,758","The intricacies of shelling your mind,
it had never been done before."
619,"01:02:04,160","01:02:06,515","It was inevitable
there would be failures."
620,"01:02:08,040","01:02:09,393",How many?
621,"01:02:13,560","01:02:14,879",Dozens.
622,"01:02:19,840","01:02:21,159",How many?
623,"01:02:24,880","01:02:27,917","Ninety-eight unsuccessful attempts
before you."
624,"01:02:30,480","01:02:32,675",You killed 98 innocent people.
625,"01:02:32,760","01:02:35,228","No, I didn't kill anyone."
626,"01:02:36,600","01:02:38,750","You wouldn't be here.
You wouldn't exist"
627,"01:02:38,840","01:02:40,751","if it weren't for
those experiments."
628,"01:02:40,960","01:02:42,598","""Experiments""?"
629,"01:02:44,440","01:02:46,749","- Is that what I am to you?
- No!"
630,"01:02:48,920","01:02:50,433","No, Mira!"
631,"01:02:55,840","01:02:57,831",Sacrifices were made.
632,"01:03:00,280","01:03:02,589",Where did the bodies come from?
633,"01:03:04,680","01:03:06,557",Where did I come from?
634,"01:03:08,120","01:03:10,031",Mr. Cutter brought them to us.
635,"01:03:10,480","01:03:12,357",I didn't ask questions.
636,"01:03:12,600","01:03:13,953",The harbor!
637,"01:03:14,720","01:03:16,199",My parents.
638,"01:03:16,880","01:03:18,552",The way they died.
639,"01:03:20,560","01:03:22,152",Did that happen?
640,"01:03:25,200","01:03:26,349",No.
641,"01:03:29,400","01:03:31,868",We gave you false memories.
642,"01:03:33,200","01:03:34,872",Cutter wanted to motivate you
643,"01:03:35,240","01:03:36,593",to fight terrorists.
644,"01:03:36,680","01:03:37,874",I didn't approve.
645,"01:03:38,000","01:03:41,595","It was cruel, but my work,
it was important,"
646,"01:03:42,240","01:03:43,912",and you were born.
647,"01:03:45,160","01:03:47,071",You were so beautiful.
648,"01:03:49,160","01:03:51,913",Nothing I have is real.
649,"01:03:54,400","01:03:55,913",I found him.
650,"01:03:56,760","01:03:58,239",I told you to be careful.
651,"01:03:58,480","01:04:01,358","You knew who he was
the whole time."
652,"01:04:01,480","01:04:02,799",You built him.
653,"01:04:04,120","01:04:08,636","He had a violent, unstable mind."
654,"01:04:09,400","01:04:11,960","His cerebral connections
wouldn't hold!"
655,"01:04:12,040","01:04:14,270","- I tried to save him!
- No."
656,"01:04:15,240","01:04:17,037",You left him to die.
657,"01:04:27,960","01:04:29,678","Nothing on Kuze yet, sir."
658,"01:04:29,800","01:04:31,518",Checking upper zones next.
659,"01:04:32,960","01:04:34,791",Is there any word on Major?
660,"01:04:40,720","01:04:42,358","Copy that, sir."
661,"01:04:42,960","01:04:44,951",I know where to find her.
662,"01:05:28,720","01:05:30,551",I didn't ask you to come here.
663,"01:05:31,840","01:05:33,353",You never ask.
664,"01:05:33,720","01:05:35,358",But I always do.
665,"01:05:40,040","01:05:41,758",Did they send you to bring me in?
666,"01:05:43,360","01:05:46,193","I'm just here to fish.
Did you see any?"
667,"01:05:46,680","01:05:48,636","You're a company man.
You follow orders,"
668,"01:05:48,720","01:05:50,711","so if they ordered you
to kill me..."
669,"01:05:50,840","01:05:53,991","Stop saying shit like that.
You're gonna piss me off."
670,"01:06:16,720","01:06:18,995",What's it like down there?
671,"01:06:19,920","01:06:21,751",It's cold and dark.
672,"01:06:23,120","01:06:25,270",Just a million miles away.
673,"01:06:26,560","01:06:28,073",No voices.
674,"01:06:28,960","01:06:30,712",No data streaming.
675,"01:06:31,960","01:06:33,188",Just
676,"01:06:36,480","01:06:37,480",nothing.
677,"01:06:41,880","01:06:44,872","- It scares me.
- Then why do you do it?"
678,"01:06:51,960","01:06:53,951",It feels real.
679,"01:06:54,440","01:06:56,237",Why didn't you stop him?
680,"01:06:59,720","01:07:01,711",I don't know who to trust anymore.
681,"01:07:02,760","01:07:04,273","You trust me, right?"
682,"01:07:09,200","01:07:10,349","Yeah, I do."
683,"01:07:13,640","01:07:15,437",I just don't like it.
684,"01:07:23,760","01:07:25,079",I need you to take me back.
685,"01:07:26,000","01:07:27,831",There's more I need to find out.
686,"01:07:32,520","01:07:33,635",Sure.
687,"01:07:51,680","01:07:53,352","Dr. Ouelet,"
688,"01:07:54,000","01:07:55,956",what have you told her?
689,"01:07:58,000","01:07:59,353",She knows.
690,"01:08:00,520","01:08:02,238",I'm bringing her in.
691,"01:08:32,960","01:08:35,076","Hanka Security
to headquarters."
692,"01:08:35,960","01:08:37,598",We have the Major.
693,"01:09:14,560","01:09:16,232",Why is she sedated?
694,"01:09:16,920","01:09:19,275",She's been turned by a terrorist.
695,"01:09:20,160","01:09:22,196",But you know that already.
696,"01:09:24,480","01:09:28,155","You should've called the first time
she came to see you."
697,"01:09:28,600","01:09:30,238","Instead, you gave her information."
698,"01:09:30,400","01:09:32,516","What makes you think
you have the right to tell me"
699,"01:09:32,600","01:09:34,830","- what to do and what...
- 2571 took us close."
700,"01:09:35,200","01:09:36,997","It's time to move on
to the next iteration."
701,"01:09:37,080","01:09:38,513",2571 is not a failure.
702,"01:09:38,600","01:09:40,750","I'll delete all the data
and reprogram her."
703,"01:09:40,840","01:09:42,353",She won't remember him at all!
704,"01:09:42,440","01:09:43,998","No. No, no, no."
705,"01:09:44,360","01:09:47,352","You download all the data
on the terrorist,"
706,"01:09:47,520","01:09:49,909",and then I order you to terminate.
707,"01:09:53,240","01:09:54,275",What?
708,"01:09:54,400","01:09:56,914",You'll build one that's better.
709,"01:09:57,360","01:10:00,432","- I'll delete everything.
- You've deleted before."
710,"01:10:03,920","01:10:05,911","- She's mine.
- No."
711,"01:10:06,080","01:10:08,469",She's a contract. With me.
712,"01:10:08,600","01:10:10,238",We succeeded.
713,"01:10:10,440","01:10:13,796","She's more than human
and more than A.I."
714,"01:10:14,240","01:10:16,834",We changed her entire identity.
715,"01:10:16,920","01:10:18,512",But her ghost survived!
716,"01:10:18,600","01:10:20,875",Her ghost is what failed us.
717,"01:10:21,320","01:10:22,878",We cannot control her.
718,"01:10:22,960","01:10:24,757",She's no longer a viable asset.
719,"01:10:31,120","01:10:32,633",You should be the one to do it.
720,"01:10:42,240","01:10:44,231",What are you doing to me?
721,"01:10:46,000","01:10:48,036","I'll run the standard synaptic,"
722,"01:10:48,120","01:10:50,839","upload your data on the raid,"
723,"01:10:51,720","01:10:53,790","find out exactly
what Kuze told you."
724,"01:10:55,520","01:10:57,670",You know what he told me.
725,"01:10:57,960","01:10:59,313",The truth.
726,"01:11:03,000","01:11:05,434","You're deleting everything,
aren't you?"
727,"01:11:05,520","01:11:06,669",No.
728,"01:11:08,200","01:11:11,317",Make it so I don't remember
729,"01:11:12,200","01:11:13,269",you.
730,"01:11:22,640","01:11:25,313","My name is Major Mira Killian,"
731,"01:11:26,000","01:11:29,549","and I do not consent
to the deletion of this data."
732,"01:11:31,320","01:11:33,788",I do not consent.
733,"01:11:36,000","01:11:38,309",I do not consent.
734,"01:11:39,000","01:11:41,309",We never needed your consent.
735,"01:11:45,360","01:11:47,157",Yours or anyone's.
736,"01:11:51,720","01:11:53,836","You're killing me,"
737,"01:11:55,000","01:11:56,513",aren't you?
738,"01:12:15,960","01:12:17,075",Mira?
739,"01:12:19,600","01:12:20,919",You hear me?
740,"01:12:24,600","01:12:25,715",Mira?
741,"01:12:29,040","01:12:31,998","This is your past,
your real past. Take it."
742,"01:12:33,080","01:12:35,150","- Guards!
- Come on, come on!"
743,"01:12:35,240","01:12:36,559","Come on, go!"
744,"01:12:43,760","01:12:44,760",Go.
745,"01:12:45,280","01:12:46,315",Go!
746,"01:12:46,560","01:12:47,560",Hey!
747,"01:12:53,160","01:12:55,958","Please relocate
to your designated safe room."
748,"01:12:56,440","01:12:59,159",Security alert on level 25.
749,"01:13:00,280","01:13:02,635",Initiating lockdown procedure.
750,"01:13:02,960","01:13:05,554","Please relocate
to your designated safe room."
751,"01:13:05,640","01:13:07,471","Thank you
for your cooperation."
752,"01:13:10,640","01:13:13,359","That's the problem
with the human heart."
753,"01:13:55,960","01:13:57,951",She killed Dr. Ouelet!
754,"01:13:58,040","01:14:00,076","You're to have
no further contact with her."
755,"01:14:00,160","01:14:01,752","Hanka Security
will hunt her from here."
756,"01:14:01,840","01:14:04,229","- What are their orders?
- To terminate on sight."
757,"01:14:04,400","01:14:06,197","You want to kill her?
You built her!"
758,"01:14:06,360","01:14:07,588",Have your sergeant stand down.
759,"01:14:07,680","01:14:09,636","The Major would
never harm Dr. Ouelet!"
760,"01:14:09,720","01:14:11,438",She's not the Major anymore!
761,"01:14:11,680","01:14:14,911","We have a Section 9 operative
under terrorist programing."
762,"01:14:15,000","01:14:17,719","This goes public,
your unit goes down."
763,"01:14:23,040","01:14:25,235",I'll take that under advisement.
764,"01:14:28,840","01:14:30,432",So what now?
765,"01:15:22,920","01:15:24,273",Hey. Hey.
766,"01:15:24,400","01:15:26,231","Oh, Pumpkin!"
767,"01:15:26,920","01:15:29,115","Oh, you surprised me."
768,"01:15:30,280","01:15:31,349",Ooh.
769,"01:15:31,720","01:15:33,631",She likes you.
770,"01:15:34,640","01:15:36,312","I was looking for, um..."
771,"01:15:36,480","01:15:37,708",Come in.
772,"01:15:38,600","01:15:40,158","Yeah, come, come."
773,"01:15:44,800","01:15:47,234",Can I offer you some tea?
774,"01:15:47,920","01:15:49,069","- Okay.
- Uh-huh."
775,"01:16:00,520","01:16:01,919",That's Motoko's room.
776,"01:16:04,360","01:16:06,351",My daughter died a year ago.
777,"01:16:07,840","01:16:09,114",I'm sorry.
778,"01:16:09,320","01:16:11,311",She ran away.
779,"01:16:12,120","01:16:13,951",She was difficult.
780,"01:16:14,320","01:16:18,632","And, uh, we fought."
781,"01:16:19,960","01:16:23,555","But I guess we all fight
with our parents, right?"
782,"01:16:25,000","01:16:26,752","Please come and sit, yeah?"
783,"01:16:47,680","01:16:49,113",What happened to her?
784,"01:16:50,240","01:16:52,196",I don't know.
785,"01:16:54,360","01:16:58,353","The ministry sent me her ashes,"
786,"01:16:59,520","01:17:02,398","and they told me
she took her own life."
787,"01:17:05,480","01:17:08,836","But, Motoko...
No, no, no."
788,"01:17:09,160","01:17:12,152",I never believed them.
789,"01:17:12,720","01:17:14,711","She was happy,"
790,"01:17:15,040","01:17:18,555","living in the lawless zone
with her friends."
791,"01:17:19,200","01:17:22,715",She'd write her manifestos about
792,"01:17:23,560","01:17:28,429","how technology was
destroying the world."
793,"01:17:30,520","01:17:32,397","Then, one day,"
794,"01:17:32,480","01:17:34,994","the police came,"
795,"01:17:35,080","01:17:36,559",and they ran.
796,"01:17:44,720","01:17:46,517",It's strange.
797,"01:17:53,040","01:17:56,828","I see her
in so many young women."
798,"01:17:57,600","01:18:00,910","On the street,
in my dreams."
799,"01:18:01,520","01:18:04,193",As if she's still here.
800,"01:18:05,240","01:18:06,719",She was
801,"01:18:07,560","01:18:09,073",fearless!
802,"01:18:11,800","01:18:13,472",And wild.
803,"01:18:14,120","01:18:16,588",You remind me of her.
804,"01:18:18,080","01:18:19,274",Sorry.
805,"01:18:23,640","01:18:25,915",How do I remind you of her?
806,"01:18:27,800","01:18:30,234",The way you look at me.
807,"01:18:36,280","01:18:37,679",Who are you?
808,"01:18:41,200","01:18:42,792",I don't know.
809,"01:18:44,120","01:18:45,792","Wait, wait, wait!"
810,"01:18:47,800","01:18:50,314",Will you come again to visit me?
811,"01:18:52,160","01:18:53,354",I will.
812,"01:19:19,680","01:19:21,238",Aramaki.
813,"01:19:22,000","01:19:23,353",Listen to me.
814,"01:19:23,840","01:19:26,115",I was never in a terrorist bombing.
815,"01:19:26,520","01:19:27,873","My parents,"
816,"01:19:28,640","01:19:31,313","everything was data
they installed in my mind."
817,"01:19:32,680","01:19:34,750",And there were others.
818,"01:19:34,840","01:19:36,671",Runaways like me
819,"01:19:37,360","01:19:39,351",considered disposable.
820,"01:19:39,920","01:19:42,832","Kuze was one of them.
That's why he's coming."
821,"01:19:43,880","01:19:45,199",For Hanka.
822,"01:19:48,800","01:19:50,597",Dr. Ouelet can.
823,"01:20:05,200","01:20:06,519",Put me on the grid.
824,"01:20:06,600","01:20:07,828",I need Kuze to find me.
825,"01:20:12,040","01:20:14,395","I know.
But I need to do this."
826,"01:20:29,360","01:20:31,316",The virus has spread.
827,"01:22:06,680","01:22:07,829",Shh.
828,"01:23:00,280","01:23:02,396",We've located Major on the grid.
829,"01:23:02,480","01:23:04,072",She's in the lawless zone.
830,"01:23:04,160","01:23:06,276",Air support five minutes out.
831,"01:23:06,880","01:23:09,348",Is the spider tank within range?
832,"01:23:11,000","01:23:13,275","Yes, sir.
Awaiting your orders, sir."
833,"01:24:16,440","01:24:17,668",Hideo!
834,"01:24:17,800","01:24:19,472",Motoko!
835,"01:25:27,880","01:25:29,598",It is real.
836,"01:25:33,080","01:25:34,911",This place.
837,"01:25:42,520","01:25:45,034",I remember what they did to us.
838,"01:25:45,240","01:25:47,754",Cutter and his men.
839,"01:25:47,880","01:25:49,916",This is where they took us from.
840,"01:25:56,920","01:25:58,558",We used to sleep right here.
841,"01:26:00,400","01:26:02,436","We were like a family,"
842,"01:26:02,560","01:26:04,551",all of us runaways.
843,"01:26:06,080","01:26:07,752","We had nothing,"
844,"01:26:11,600","01:26:13,352",except each other.
845,"01:26:17,160","01:26:19,549",They took that from us.
846,"01:26:35,640","01:26:37,676",Your name was Hideo.
847,"01:26:48,800","01:26:50,279",Motoko.
848,"01:26:52,960","01:26:54,757",That was your name.
849,"01:26:58,280","01:26:59,633",Motoko.
850,"01:27:03,480","01:27:04,913",Come with me
851,"01:27:06,320","01:27:08,151",into my network.
852,"01:27:08,960","01:27:11,474",We will evolve beyond them.
853,"01:27:12,160","01:27:16,790","And together, we can avenge
what they have done to us."
854,"01:27:17,280","01:27:18,315",Come
855,"01:27:18,760","01:27:20,318",with me.
856,"01:27:38,160","01:27:39,991",I'll take control from here.
857,"01:27:40,080","01:27:42,196",Weapons system manual command.
858,"01:27:43,520","01:27:45,829",Spider tank now active.
859,"01:27:54,840","01:27:56,796",It's Cutter! He found us!
860,"01:29:34,960","01:29:36,313",Target acquired.
861,"01:29:38,440","01:29:39,634",No!
862,"01:29:48,960","01:29:50,951",Target eliminated.
863,"01:30:06,760","01:30:08,716","You came close,"
864,"01:30:08,840","01:30:10,159",you freak.
865,"01:30:42,440","01:30:44,954",Motor center compromised.
866,"01:31:28,200","01:31:30,077",Sniper team on site?
867,"01:31:30,400","01:31:32,709","We're approaching
the targets now, sir."
868,"01:31:35,120","01:31:36,758",Come with me.
869,"01:31:38,080","01:31:41,356",There is no place for us here.
870,"01:31:45,960","01:31:47,075",No.
871,"01:31:52,720","01:31:55,075",I'm not ready to leave.
872,"01:31:56,720","01:31:58,392",I belong here.
873,"01:32:02,120","01:32:04,953",I will always be there with you
874,"01:32:05,840","01:32:07,671",in your ghost.
875,"01:32:14,440","01:32:15,589",Target is in view.
876,"01:32:15,880","01:32:17,359",What are you waiting for?
877,"01:32:17,440","01:32:18,440",Do it!
878,"01:32:20,960","01:32:22,439",No!
879,"01:32:23,120","01:32:24,633",Keep firing.
880,"01:32:56,000","01:32:57,069",Hey.
881,"01:32:59,320","01:33:00,389",Hey.
882,"01:33:04,480","01:33:06,471",Say something nice.
883,"01:33:08,040","01:33:09,678",What's your name?
884,"01:33:09,880","01:33:13,395","Aramaki told me
you had a name from before."
885,"01:33:17,320","01:33:19,038",Motoko.
886,"01:33:23,760","01:33:25,876","Major is still in there, right?"
887,"01:33:27,800","01:33:29,074",I am.
888,"01:33:57,200","01:33:59,350","I thought
that it might be you."
889,"01:34:25,200","01:34:26,315",Please.
890,"01:34:34,840","01:34:36,910",Tell him this is justice.
891,"01:34:37,520","01:34:39,431",It's what I was built for.
892,"01:34:43,800","01:34:45,472","My name is Major,"
893,"01:34:46,120","01:34:48,156",and I give my consent.
894,"01:35:59,320","01:36:01,880",You don't have to come here anymore.
895,"01:36:04,440","01:36:05,793",I know.
896,"01:36:40,360","01:36:43,158",My mind is human.
897,"01:36:44,600","01:36:46,716",My body is manufactured.
898,"01:36:48,680","01:36:50,796","I'm the first of my kind,"
899,"01:36:52,480","01:36:54,391",but I won't be the last.
900,"01:36:58,520","01:37:01,910","We cling to memories
as if they define us."
901,"01:37:03,200","01:37:06,158",But what we do defines us.
902,"01:37:12,360","01:37:15,716","My ghost survived
to remind the next of us"
903,"01:37:16,600","01:37:19,751",that humanity is our virtue.
904,"01:37:21,720","01:37:23,551",I know who I am
905,"01:37:24,320","01:37:26,390",and what I'm here to do.
