2,"00:01:26,003","00:01:27,760","What?
I found something."
3,"00:01:27,829","00:01:29,171",You gotta check this out.
4,"00:01:31,466","00:01:32,832",Jumanji.
5,"00:01:35,137","00:01:36,353",Board game?
6,"00:01:36,430","00:01:37,917",Who plays board games?
7,"00:03:12,818","00:03:14,480",Parry. Parry.
8,"00:03:14,653","00:03:16,365",Evade. Blam.
9,"00:03:16,738","00:03:18,000",Uppercut.
10,"00:03:18,573","00:03:19,859",Head slam. You're dead.
11,"00:03:20,033","00:03:22,997",Strike. Strike. Counterstrike. Head slam.
12,"00:03:27,207","00:03:28,671",I got it.
13,"00:03:39,469","00:03:42,834","Benjamin Franklin, and it was
this sense of national exceptionalism..."
14,"00:03:43,807","00:03:46,941","that fueled the spreading wildfire
of westward expansion."
15,"00:03:47,110","00:03:48,397",Spencer? Honey?
16,"00:03:49,604","00:03:52,347","Mom, what did we say about the knocking?"
17,"00:03:52,371","00:03:55,267","I'm late for work. Are you going
to your father's after school?"
18,"00:03:55,444","00:03:57,406","Yeah, probably.
Don't forget your EpiPen."
19,"00:03:57,479","00:03:59,416","And pease, remember,
the world is a terrifying place."
20,"00:03:59,489","00:04:01,531","Be careful of everything.
I love you more than life itself."
21,"00:04:01,555","00:04:03,194","Bye. See you Sunday night.
Ok."
22,"00:04:10,000","00:04:10,676","Later, Mama."
23,"00:04:10,701","00:04:12,391",Eat something before you go.
24,"00:04:12,644","00:04:14,260",I can't. I gotta go meet Spencer.
25,"00:04:14,796","00:04:16,001",Spencer Gilpin?
26,"00:04:16,026","00:04:17,107","Yeah, Spencer Gilpin."
27,"00:04:17,157","00:04:18,523",He's been tutoring me. He...
28,"00:04:18,800","00:04:20,938","He's helping me get my grades up.
I love to hear that."
29,"00:04:21,011","00:04:23,049","Little Spencer Gilpin.
Yeah."
30,"00:04:23,722","00:04:26,410","Your grades gonna be Ok?
Yeah, that's why I'm getting help."
31,"00:04:26,683","00:04:28,049",I'd hate for you to get dropped from the team.
32,"00:04:28,073","00:04:29,618",I'm not gonna get dropped from the team.
33,"00:04:32,189","00:04:34,422",It's... It's gonna be fine. Ok?
34,"00:04:53,835","00:04:55,101",Ok.
35,"00:04:55,879","00:04:58,147","That's cute, right?"
36,"00:04:58,924","00:04:59,986",Yeah.
37,"00:05:22,447","00:05:24,330","Yo.
Hey, Fridge."
38,"00:05:25,992","00:05:27,354",Why you wearing a raincoat?
39,"00:05:27,828","00:05:29,865","What do you mean?
I mean, it's not raining."
40,"00:05:31,206","00:05:33,394","Well, it might. I mean, you never know
what's gonna happen."
41,"00:05:35,752","00:05:37,565","Oy vey.
What the hell, man?"
42,"00:05:37,789","00:05:39,491","Do you mind?
Can we just speed this up?"
43,"00:05:39,716","00:05:42,101","Freak House makes me,
very uncomfortable."
44,"00:05:42,634","00:05:43,866",Here you go.
45,"00:05:45,554","00:05:47,371","You proofread everything?
Yeah, I proofed it."
46,"00:05:47,548","00:05:49,731",And I gave it a beginning and...
47,"00:05:50,717","00:05:51,900",and an ending...
48,"00:05:52,725","00:05:53,644",and some in the middle.
49,"00:05:53,645","00:05:55,047","Look man, I would've done it myself,"
50,"00:05:55,072","00:05:56,655","you know friend, if I had
the time or whatever but..."
51,"00:05:56,656","00:05:57,948","Yeah, it's no big deal."
52,"00:05:58,525","00:05:59,979","Hey man, I was thinking so..."
53,"00:06:00,304","00:06:03,686","I mean, it's been really fun doing your
papers and your homework and stuff but..."
54,"00:06:04,155","00:06:06,390","I don't know what you're doing this weekend
but I was maybe we could..."
55,"00:06:06,391","00:06:08,034",This weekend. Yeah.
56,"00:06:09,911","00:06:11,523","Hey, Fridge.
Hey."
57,"00:06:12,581","00:06:13,822",You need a ride?
58,"00:06:14,499","00:06:16,491","I'm going with her.
You know what?"
59,"00:06:16,668","00:06:19,552","That's actually better for me,
scheduling-wise, too, so..."
60,"00:06:20,422","00:06:22,004","See you later, Refrigerator."
61,"00:06:22,966","00:06:24,903",Sorry. Sorry.
62,"00:06:25,552","00:06:26,784","What up, girl?"
63,"00:06:28,847","00:06:29,909",Whatever.
64,"00:06:30,932","00:06:32,508","It's not like I was your best friend,"
65,"00:06:32,733","00:06:33,994",for your entire childhood.
66,"00:06:34,144","00:06:35,531","That's fine.
What'd you say?"
67,"00:06:40,025","00:06:41,132","Nothing, sir."
68,"00:06:42,611","00:06:44,498","Oh, that guy is super weird."
69,"00:06:44,905","00:06:46,112",That poor man.
70,"00:06:46,381","00:06:48,639",So awful what happened to those people.
71,"00:06:49,910","00:06:51,437",I was talking about the kid.
72,"00:06:51,862","00:06:53,498",What are you doing out here?
73,"00:06:53,680","00:06:55,122",I was just talking to my friend.
74,"00:06:55,999","00:06:58,934","You should be more careful
where you loiter, you hear me?"
75,"00:06:58,935","00:07:00,125","Yes, Mr. Vreeke."
76,"00:07:00,350","00:07:01,242",I hear you.
77,"00:07:01,387","00:07:03,925",This world swallows up kids like you.
78,"00:07:21,900","00:07:24,998","It's been two hours since I've posted
and he hasn't commented."
79,"00:07:25,023","00:07:26,300",He hasn't even liked it.
80,"00:07:26,446","00:07:28,529","You saw it.
Yeah, gorge."
81,"00:07:28,698","00:07:30,234",I don't know what his problem is.
82,"00:07:30,408","00:07:33,446","Thank you. It's not like I post
all the time, just enough to stay relevant."
83,"00:07:33,620","00:07:36,880","But it's cute enough for Noah to at least...
Hey, there's some rando behind you."
84,"00:07:38,917","00:07:39,617",Hi.
85,"00:07:40,041","00:07:41,041",Hi.
86,"00:07:41,336","00:07:43,953","Bethany, did you just make a call
during the quiz?"
87,"00:07:44,130","00:07:45,817",Yeah. But I finished my quiz already.
88,"00:07:46,091","00:07:49,550","Oh, Ok. Well, have you noticed
that other people haven't?"
89,"00:07:50,929","00:07:51,700",So?
90,"00:07:52,325","00:07:53,837",I'm sorry. Let me back up.
91,"00:07:54,182","00:07:57,266","You're aware there are other people
in the world, right?"
92,"00:07:58,478","00:07:59,478",Look...
93,"00:07:59,689","00:08:02,747","you know, I'm dealing with
something right now and..."
94,"00:08:03,400","00:08:04,936","Trustme I'm no happier about it
than you are."
95,"00:08:05,110","00:08:07,648","I'm having a crisis, and Lucinda, I mean,"
96,"00:08:08,021","00:08:11,590","she's supporting me as a woman,
and it feels like maybe you should too."
97,"00:08:13,702","00:08:15,889","Just hang up the phone.
Ok, I'll wrap it up."
98,"00:08:15,913","00:08:18,249","Bethany, hang it up now.
Two minutes and we're done."
99,"00:08:18,273","00:08:20,239",And that's detention.
100,"00:08:21,918","00:08:25,036","All right, keep those arms pumping.
Let's go!"
101,"00:08:25,964","00:08:28,128","Bethany, you're late.
Sorry."
102,"00:08:31,052","00:08:33,260",I heard she broke up with that football guy.
103,"00:08:34,264","00:08:36,121","This could be your opening, Fussfeld."
104,"00:08:37,100","00:08:39,638","All right, we're gonna practice
catching and throwing."
105,"00:08:39,811","00:08:42,849","So partner up and grab a football.
Let's move!"
106,"00:08:45,608","00:08:46,689","Hey, Martha."
107,"00:08:47,360","00:08:50,023",Martha. You can't play catch by yourself.
108,"00:08:50,196","00:08:51,212",Pair up.
109,"00:08:51,990","00:08:53,301",Come on. Let's go.
110,"00:08:53,783","00:08:55,374","No. No, I'm good."
111,"00:08:56,494","00:08:57,551",Ok.
112,"00:09:01,374","00:09:04,057","You have to participate
just like everybody else."
113,"00:09:04,127","00:09:05,935","Otherwise, why are you even here?"
114,"00:09:06,504","00:09:07,665",It's a requirement.
115,"00:09:07,839","00:09:09,455","Martha...
I think it's pointless."
116,"00:09:09,632","00:09:11,373","Gym class is not gonna get me
into Princeton"
117,"00:09:11,551","00:09:13,258","and I don't understand
the obsession with throwing"
118,"00:09:13,428","00:09:15,566","a ball into a hoop and
Touchdown, five points!"
119,"00:09:15,590","00:09:16,590",Ok.
120,"00:09:16,839","00:09:19,353","There's a lot wrong with that,
but first of all."
121,"00:09:19,726","00:09:21,513","It's physical activity,
which is good for you."
122,"00:09:21,686","00:09:24,003","With other people, also good for you."
123,"00:09:24,147","00:09:25,292","And if you try it,"
124,"00:09:25,617","00:09:27,089",you might even have some fun.
125,"00:09:27,442","00:09:29,700",Fun. That's what we're doing here? Fun?
126,"00:09:30,070","00:09:31,402",This is school.
127,"00:09:31,571","00:09:33,984","We are supposed to be learning things
that actually matter."
128,"00:09:34,157","00:09:36,444","Ok, Martha...
We don't have a lot of time in this life,"
129,"00:09:36,618","00:09:39,689","and I personally don't wanna
waste it on being, like, a..."
130,"00:09:39,714","00:09:40,737",gym teacher.
131,"00:09:42,957","00:09:46,075","That. That. That came out wrong.
Yeah, it sure did."
132,"00:09:46,586","00:09:47,667",That's detention.
133,"00:09:49,130","00:09:50,797",That was hard-core.
134,"00:09:51,925","00:09:53,132",Badass.
135,"00:09:53,502","00:09:54,814",Spencer Gilpin?
136,"00:09:59,849","00:10:00,885","Have a seat, Spencer."
137,"00:10:12,112","00:10:13,193",Miss Mathers?
138,"00:10:13,363","00:10:16,064","And it was this sense of
national exceptionalism"
139,"00:10:16,065","00:10:19,525","that fueled the spreading wildfire
of westward expansion."
140,"00:10:19,994","00:10:22,252","Does that sound familiar, Mr. Gilpin?"
141,"00:10:24,582","00:10:25,842",It does not.
142,"00:10:25,843","00:10:29,447","It's the last sentence of Anthony's
paper on westward expansion."
143,"00:10:29,520","00:10:31,858","And, coincidentally, it's the last sentence"
144,"00:10:31,882","00:10:35,151","of your paper on westward
expansion from last year."
145,"00:10:37,971","00:10:39,387",That's interesting.
146,"00:10:40,181","00:10:41,313",Is it?
147,"00:10:41,683","00:10:42,631",I think so.
148,"00:10:42,756","00:10:44,400","I mean, what are the odds of that?"
149,"00:10:44,853","00:10:45,910",Slim.
150,"00:10:46,855","00:10:49,268","Yeah, you also used the same metaphor"
151,"00:10:49,440","00:10:51,523",the spreading wildfire in your papers
152,"00:10:51,547","00:10:54,911","on the Boston Tea Party,
the Battle of Gettysburg"
153,"00:10:54,988","00:10:57,321",and the women's suffrage movement.
154,"00:11:00,118","00:11:02,355",It's so hot in this room.
155,"00:11:02,787","00:11:06,276","Anthony, I know how much
you need to pass my class"
156,"00:11:06,449","00:11:07,965",but this is not how you're gonna do it.
157,"00:11:08,042","00:11:10,400","I will not tolerate cheating.
Cheating?"
158,"00:11:10,670","00:11:13,329","I didn't. I didn't. I didn't cheat.
It was my fault."
159,"00:11:14,841","00:11:16,232",I made him do it.
160,"00:11:16,926","00:11:18,538",You made him...
161,"00:11:19,345","00:11:22,179",have you write his paper?
162,"00:11:23,600","00:11:24,611",Yeah.
163,"00:11:29,355","00:11:32,291","Look. I'm sorry, Ok?"
164,"00:11:32,292","00:11:34,000","No, no, it's not Ok."
165,"00:11:35,069","00:11:37,061","What the hell, man?
You got me kicked off the team."
166,"00:11:37,085","00:11:38,647",You could've gotten me expelled.
167,"00:11:39,072","00:11:41,899","It's not like you're the only one
who's living dangerously here."
168,"00:11:42,076","00:11:43,638","Living dangerously?
Yes."
169,"00:11:43,912","00:11:45,925","This is the most dangerous thing
I've ever done in my life."
170,"00:11:47,540","00:11:48,847",And now look at me.
171,"00:11:49,417","00:11:50,904",I'm paying the price.
172,"00:11:52,086","00:11:53,122",Well...
173,"00:11:53,296","00:11:54,908",isn't this a fun group?
174,"00:11:55,381","00:11:57,619",Welcome to detention.
175,"00:11:58,927","00:12:00,919","Yes, Spencer?
I wanna say that I'm sorry."
176,"00:12:01,596","00:12:04,054","Thank you.
Principal Bentley, all I did was make one..."
177,"00:12:04,124","00:12:06,932","Bethany, please. You're all here
for a reason. You know what it is."
178,"00:12:07,101","00:12:09,043","But this is what
you should be thinking about:"
179,"00:12:09,771","00:12:12,980",Who you are...
180,"00:12:13,149","00:12:14,606","in this moment in time,"
181,"00:12:14,776","00:12:16,768",and who you want to be.
182,"00:12:17,695","00:12:19,387",You get one life.
183,"00:12:20,156","00:12:22,193",You decide how you're gonna spend it.
184,"00:12:24,452","00:12:25,834","Fortunately,"
185,"00:12:26,204","00:12:28,696","there is no better place for self-reflection,"
186,"00:12:28,873","00:12:30,239",than detention.
187,"00:12:30,416","00:12:31,853","Get up, everybody. Let's go."
188,"00:12:45,765","00:12:48,052","We are turning this
into a new computer center."
189,"00:12:48,326","00:12:50,368","But before we do,
it has to be cleaned out."
190,"00:12:50,645","00:12:53,058","These old magazines are bound
for the recycling plant."
191,"00:12:53,431","00:12:55,414","But they have to be prepped
before they go."
192,"00:12:56,025","00:12:59,660",It seems all the staples must be removed.
193,"00:13:00,029","00:13:02,863","Whatever you don't finish today,
you finish tomorrow."
194,"00:13:03,032","00:13:04,989","Tomorrow's Saturday.
Because I wouldn't play football?"
195,"00:13:05,159","00:13:06,796","I don't think that'll work.
That's fair."
196,"00:13:07,370","00:13:08,161",Shut up.
197,"00:13:08,186","00:13:09,758",So I suggest you get started.
198,"00:13:10,957","00:13:12,874",Choose your weapons.
199,"00:13:18,965","00:13:21,178","Hey, what the hell
they need with a bowling ball?"
200,"00:13:22,969","00:13:24,835","Seriously, no reception?"
201,"00:13:25,013","00:13:26,627","Ok, can today get any worse?"
202,"00:13:26,652","00:13:27,980",Are you gonna help?
203,"00:13:28,433","00:13:29,674",Or are you too pretty?
204,"00:13:30,268","00:13:31,509",I'm too pretty.
205,"00:13:36,858","00:13:39,521","Hey. I was watching you
with Coach Web today."
206,"00:13:39,902","00:13:43,066","I ean I wasn't watching you, I wasn't...
Not, like, in a weird way. I just..."
207,"00:13:43,239","00:13:44,980","I was in the room.
We're in the same class."
208,"00:13:45,366","00:13:48,239","I just. I thought you were saying some
really smart things about"
209,"00:13:48,263","00:13:50,124",why P.E. sucks and...
210,"00:13:51,372","00:13:53,204",about other subjects.
211,"00:13:54,208","00:13:55,299",Thanks.
212,"00:13:56,669","00:13:57,710",Yeah.
213,"00:14:02,842","00:14:04,259",Yo. What's this?
214,"00:14:06,429","00:14:07,197",I don't know.
215,"00:14:07,522","00:14:10,218","What is it, like some type
of old-school Nintendo?"
216,"00:14:10,808","00:14:12,099",I don't think so.
217,"00:14:13,061","00:14:14,222",I don't recognize it.
218,"00:14:32,246","00:14:34,989",A game for those who seek to find
219,"00:14:35,166","00:14:37,533",a way to leave their world behind.
220,"00:14:39,796","00:14:41,053",Jumanji.
221,"00:14:41,923","00:14:43,380","Staples, people. Staples."
222,"00:14:43,549","00:14:44,961",Jumanji? What does that mean?
223,"00:14:44,986","00:14:46,737","I have no idea.
Never heard of it."
224,"00:14:51,974","00:14:53,055",Which one do I pick?
225,"00:14:53,226","00:14:55,243","I don't know.
I don't think it matters that much."
226,"00:14:56,020","00:14:57,932",Jefferson 'Seaplane' McDonough
227,"00:14:58,106","00:14:59,472",pilot and rascal.
228,"00:15:00,733","00:15:02,867","It's not working.
Ok, try another one."
229,"00:15:03,736","00:15:04,943",Franklin 'Moose' Finbar.
230,"00:15:07,824","00:15:09,156",He sounds like a badass.
231,"00:15:09,659","00:15:12,242","And he's a zoology expert,
which is awesome."
232,"00:15:15,248","00:15:16,414","You pick.
Ok."
233,"00:15:18,751","00:15:22,061",Dr. Smolder Bravestone.
234,"00:15:24,590","00:15:25,847","Bethany, you in?"
235,"00:15:26,717","00:15:28,174",Fine.
236,"00:15:31,389","00:15:32,505",I'll be...
237,"00:15:32,682","00:15:34,219","Shelly Oberon,"
238,"00:15:34,892","00:15:36,178",the curvy genius.
239,"00:15:37,645","00:15:39,332","Hey, yo, Staples, come on.
It's your turn."
240,"00:15:41,206","00:15:42,206","No. No, thanks."
241,"00:15:42,602","00:15:44,023",Wait. Just for a few minutes?
242,"00:15:44,902","00:15:45,966",It'll be fun.
243,"00:15:45,991","00:15:47,343",She's not big on fun.
244,"00:15:50,700","00:15:51,499",Ok.
245,"00:15:52,824","00:15:53,824",Fine.
246,"00:15:56,914","00:15:59,177","This may be the lamest thing
I've ever done."
247,"00:15:59,750","00:16:01,358",I highly doubt that.
248,"00:16:07,300","00:16:08,757",Welcome to Jumanji!
249,"00:16:19,937","00:16:21,098",What's going on?
250,"00:16:25,234","00:16:26,566",I think it's shorting out.
251,"00:16:33,326","00:16:34,367",Unplug it!
252,"00:16:43,461","00:16:44,665",What's going on?
253,"00:16:44,766","00:16:46,548","What's happening to your hands?
What's wrong with you?"
254,"00:16:46,572","00:16:47,750",I don't know.
255,"00:16:51,511","00:16:52,592",Spencer!
256,"00:16:54,555","00:16:55,791","Oh, my God!"
257,"00:17:04,524","00:17:05,981","What the hell, man?"
258,"00:17:06,150","00:17:07,282","Oh, no."
259,"00:17:07,652","00:17:09,266",Holy shit.
260,"00:17:45,398","00:17:46,434",Guys?
261,"00:17:47,400","00:17:48,380",Guys?
262,"00:17:48,505","00:17:49,943",Why do I sound like this?
263,"00:17:57,785","00:17:59,072",Where's my hair?
264,"00:18:09,922","00:18:11,063",What the...
265,"00:18:11,841","00:18:12,982","Oh, God!"
266,"00:18:36,324","00:18:38,082",What kind of stupid-ass?
267,"00:18:40,870","00:18:42,727","Who are you?
Who are you?"
268,"00:18:45,374","00:18:46,656",Who is she?
269,"00:18:47,877","00:18:49,089",Who are you guys?
270,"00:18:49,962","00:18:51,703","Ok, what the hell?"
271,"00:18:52,131","00:18:53,793","God! Oh, my God!
Get off of me!"
272,"00:18:53,966","00:18:56,132","I am totally suing.
What's wrong with my voice?"
273,"00:18:56,302","00:18:57,740","Get off of me!
Where am I?"
274,"00:18:57,764","00:18:59,254","You're crushing me!
Get off!"
275,"00:19:01,474","00:19:02,490",Get...
276,"00:19:07,355","00:19:08,530",What the hell?
277,"00:19:08,554","00:19:11,250",What happened to the rest of me?
278,"00:19:11,901","00:19:13,793",What is this? What is this on my back?
279,"00:19:14,570","00:19:16,153","What is this?
Oh, my God."
280,"00:19:17,865","00:19:18,901",Fridge?
281,"00:19:20,284","00:19:21,676","Yeah, I'm Fridge. Who are you?"
282,"00:19:26,332","00:19:27,393",I'm Spencer.
283,"00:19:27,667","00:19:30,827","What? The hell you are.
What is going on?"
284,"00:19:32,296","00:19:33,337",I think...
285,"00:19:34,256","00:19:35,492",we're in the game.
286,"00:19:35,766","00:19:37,458","Sorry, excuse me?
What are you talking about?"
287,"00:19:37,482","00:19:39,151","Somehow, I don't know how."
288,"00:19:39,428","00:19:41,912","I think we got, like, sucked into the game."
289,"00:19:42,682","00:19:44,765","And we've become the avatars
that we chose."
290,"00:19:45,134","00:19:48,393","So it's me, Spencer,
but yet I look and sound..."
291,"00:19:48,562","00:19:51,497",like Dr. Smolder Bravestone.
292,"00:19:58,114","00:19:59,935",You're telling me that you're Spencer?
293,"00:19:59,959","00:20:01,506","Yes, yes, yes. That's it."
294,"00:20:01,659","00:20:02,962","Fridge, I'm Spencer."
295,"00:20:03,087","00:20:05,472",Which. Which means you're Moose Finbar.
296,"00:20:05,621","00:20:07,109",It says it right there on your vest.
297,"00:20:07,234","00:20:07,762",And...
298,"00:20:09,333","00:20:10,599","Martha?
Yeah."
299,"00:20:10,876","00:20:12,142",You're Ruby Roundhouse.
300,"00:20:13,170","00:20:14,248",And Bethany...
301,"00:20:14,573","00:20:16,513",you're Professor Shelly Oberon.
302,"00:20:16,966","00:20:18,761","Only Shelly must be
short for Sheldon."
303,"00:20:18,786","00:20:20,074",What are you talking about?
304,"00:20:20,219","00:20:20,834","Oh, my God."
305,"00:20:20,859","00:20:22,602","Oh, my God, he's right.
And you..."
306,"00:20:24,432","00:20:25,793",you're Spencer? You?
307,"00:20:25,818","00:20:27,790","Yes. Guys, I'm telling you."
308,"00:20:27,935","00:20:29,426",I am Spencer. I'm Spen...
309,"00:20:30,604","00:20:31,640","Yep, that's Spencer."
310,"00:20:32,898","00:20:34,706",So that means I...
311,"00:20:35,776","00:20:36,776",I'm..
312,"00:20:39,071","00:20:40,604","Wait, Bethany. Bethany, don't!"
313,"00:20:41,574","00:20:42,982",No!
314,"00:20:46,787","00:20:48,595","I'm an overweight, middle-aged man."
315,"00:20:50,866","00:20:51,902",I have a tattoo.
316,"00:20:52,251","00:20:54,538","My mom always said
she'd kill me if I ever got a tattoo."
317,"00:20:54,712","00:20:55,873",What is this?
318,"00:20:56,046","00:20:57,162",I have one too.
319,"00:21:00,384","00:21:01,384",Sometimes.
320,"00:21:02,178","00:21:03,410",Wait a second.
321,"00:21:04,180","00:21:05,737",Where's my phone?
322,"00:21:09,727","00:21:11,684",Why am I wearing this outfit in a jungle?
323,"00:21:11,954","00:21:14,430","Tiny, little shorts and
a leather halter top."
324,"00:21:14,431","00:21:15,763","I mean, what is this?"
325,"00:21:15,833","00:21:18,166","I look like a living garden gnome.
Where is my phone?"
326,"00:21:18,235","00:21:20,422","Who cares?
We are in different people's bodies!"
327,"00:21:21,155","00:21:24,000","It doesn't seem like the most
pressing concern at this moment."
328,"00:21:24,025","00:21:24,650",Oh really?
329,"00:21:24,651","00:21:27,125","You don't think this would be a
good moment to make a phone call,"
330,"00:21:27,203","00:21:27,947","or text somebody,"
331,"00:21:27,972","00:21:30,490","or change your status
to stuck in a freaking video game?"
332,"00:21:30,664","00:21:33,723","All I'm saying is,
I don't have my Claritin, Ok?"
333,"00:21:33,793","00:21:35,527",And I'm allergic to almost everything.
334,"00:21:35,551","00:21:36,795","Oh, no."
335,"00:21:37,296","00:21:38,909","You got allergies, Spencer?"
336,"00:21:39,882","00:21:41,623",I don't have the top two feet of my body!
337,"00:21:42,051","00:21:44,543","You guys, this can't actually be happening."
338,"00:21:44,720","00:21:47,133",Maybe we're all in a coma.
339,"00:21:47,306","00:21:48,316",Together?
340,"00:21:48,317","00:21:50,173",We're all in a coma together?
341,"00:21:50,226","00:21:52,559","It's the only explanation.
That old game machine"
342,"00:21:52,728","00:21:55,516","must have electrocuted all of us,
and now we're"
343,"00:21:56,899","00:21:59,767","Oh, my God, Bethany!
Oh, my God, oh, my God, oh, my God!"
344,"00:21:59,944","00:22:01,060",Stop it!
345,"00:22:08,410","00:22:09,520","Oh, my God!"
346,"00:22:09,621","00:22:11,277","You better get in there
and go save her."
347,"00:22:11,330","00:22:12,622",I'm not getting in there!
348,"00:22:12,647","00:22:13,514",You get in there.
349,"00:22:13,515","00:22:14,801","I'm not going anywhere.
I got a backpack on."
350,"00:22:15,084","00:22:17,467","You don't get in water with a backpack.
Everybody knows that."
351,"00:22:27,304","00:22:28,340",What the...
352,"00:22:28,714","00:22:29,922","Bethany!
What just..."
353,"00:22:32,268","00:22:33,375",Are you Ok?
354,"00:22:33,644","00:22:35,261",That was so intense.
355,"00:22:35,938","00:22:37,679","I, like, can't even with this place."
356,"00:22:37,857","00:22:39,005",What just happened to you?
357,"00:22:39,030","00:22:40,089","I got eaten by a rhino,"
358,"00:22:40,334","00:22:42,792","and then I fell like
a thousand feet from the sky."
359,"00:22:43,062","00:22:44,603","Yeah, that's what it looked like."
360,"00:22:44,780","00:22:45,613",That was a hippo.
361,"00:22:46,138","00:22:46,806",They're omnivorous.
362,"00:22:46,831","00:22:50,584","They're as fast as a horse over short distances
and they have the bite force of 8100 newtons."
363,"00:22:51,453","00:22:52,814",How do I know this?
364,"00:22:53,330","00:22:54,662",You're an expert in zoology.
365,"00:22:54,832","00:22:56,619","What?
I'm still an old fat guy, right?"
366,"00:22:56,792","00:22:57,947",I'm afraid so.
367,"00:22:58,372","00:22:59,149",Wait.
368,"00:22:59,295","00:23:00,731",Why is everybody Ok with this?
369,"00:23:00,755","00:23:03,313","I mean, she fell out of the sky."
370,"00:23:03,965","00:23:04,965",Guys?
371,"00:23:08,888","00:23:10,001","Bethany, get up."
372,"00:23:10,326","00:23:11,922","Bethany, get up. Get up!"
373,"00:23:18,480","00:23:22,064","Go, go, go!"
374,"00:23:25,863","00:23:27,131",Dr. Bravestone!
375,"00:23:27,356","00:23:29,046",Welcome to Jumanji!
376,"00:23:30,910","00:23:32,273",Don't just stand there.
377,"00:23:32,398","00:23:33,492",In you go.
378,"00:23:33,537","00:23:34,994","Go, go, go, go, go.
Yeah."
379,"00:23:47,134","00:23:48,420",Dr. Bravestone.
380,"00:23:48,928","00:23:51,545","Famed archaeologist
and international explorer."
381,"00:23:51,722","00:23:54,965","Known across the seven continents
for your courageous exploits."
382,"00:23:55,559","00:23:56,970",Is there a seat belt?
383,"00:23:57,144","00:23:59,637","I can't tell you what an honor it is
to finally meet you."
384,"00:24:00,314","00:24:03,153","And I'm not embarrassed to say
you're even more dashing in person."
385,"00:24:04,443","00:24:05,479",Thanks.
386,"00:24:05,653","00:24:08,191","Who are you?
Nigel Billingsly at your service."
387,"00:24:08,364","00:24:10,481","Ruby Roundhouse, killer of men."
388,"00:24:10,858","00:24:12,474",Welcome to Jumanji.
389,"00:24:12,551","00:24:14,417",I've been so anxious for your arrival.
390,"00:24:15,721","00:24:17,987","As you know, Jumanji is in grave danger."
391,"00:24:18,257","00:24:20,270","We're counting on the four of you
to lift the curse."
392,"00:24:20,542","00:24:22,004","Curse?
What curse?"
393,"00:24:22,378","00:24:24,620","Excuse me.
Have you seen my phone anywhere?"
394,"00:24:25,422","00:24:27,535",Professor Sheldon Oberon.
395,"00:24:28,008","00:24:29,493",Welcome to Jumanji.
396,"00:24:29,594","00:24:31,616",Nigel Billingsly at your service.
397,"00:24:31,762","00:24:33,649",I've been so anxious for your arrival.
398,"00:24:34,348","00:24:35,555",What's with this guy?
399,"00:24:35,724","00:24:37,215",I think he's an NPC.
400,"00:24:37,393","00:24:38,884","A what? English, please."
401,"00:24:39,061","00:24:40,927","A non-player character.
He's part of the game."
402,"00:24:41,105","00:24:44,394","So anything we ask him, he only has
his programmed series of responses."
403,"00:24:44,566","00:24:46,407",Got it. It's all clear now.
404,"00:24:46,485","00:24:48,602",Franklin Mouse Finbar.
405,"00:24:48,779","00:24:50,020",Welcome to Jumanji.
406,"00:24:50,197","00:24:51,938",It's Moose. It's not Mouse.
407,"00:24:52,116","00:24:52,874","No, good sir."
408,"00:24:52,899","00:24:54,373",I'm quite sure it's Mouse.
409,"00:24:54,518","00:24:55,418",Mouse?
410,"00:24:55,442","00:24:58,824","A nickname given for your diminutive
stature and adorable manner."
411,"00:24:58,998","00:25:00,255",I knew you'd be here.
412,"00:25:00,279","00:25:03,562","Dr. Bravestone doesn't go anywhere
without his trusty sidekick."
413,"00:25:03,836","00:25:04,997",Sidekick?
414,"00:25:05,504","00:25:08,856","Ever since Dr. Bravestone rescued
you from the clutches of a warlord"
415,"00:25:08,857","00:25:10,126","in the jungles of Peru,"
416,"00:25:10,151","00:25:11,749",you've never left his side.
417,"00:25:11,802","00:25:12,479",Right.
418,"00:25:12,604","00:25:14,634",Can we go back to the curse thing?
419,"00:25:14,680","00:25:16,797","It's all documented in the letter
I sent you, Dr. Bravestone."
420,"00:25:16,974","00:25:18,546",Perhaps you should read it aloud.
421,"00:25:18,570","00:25:19,682",I don't have a let...
422,"00:25:28,402","00:25:29,402",Right.
423,"00:25:30,195","00:25:34,690","Dr. Bravestone, I am writing to you
regarding the desperate situation"
424,"00:25:34,714","00:25:37,126","in Jumanji.
We need your help at once."
425,"00:25:39,079","00:25:40,465","Guys?
What's happening?"
426,"00:25:40,539","00:25:41,980",What the hell is going on?
427,"00:25:42,157","00:25:43,295",I think it's a cut scene.
428,"00:25:43,320","00:25:44,424",A lot of games have them.
429,"00:25:44,501","00:25:47,164","It's like a little movie
to tell you the back-story."
430,"00:25:47,337","00:25:48,999",My name is Nigel Billingsly
431,"00:25:49,631","00:25:51,463",Jumanji field guide.
432,"00:25:52,134","00:25:53,875",I was hired by your former partner
433,"00:25:54,053","00:25:56,511","now nemesis, Professor Russel Van Pelt"
434,"00:25:56,680","00:25:58,421",to lead a fateful expedition.
435,"00:26:02,311","00:26:04,268","You see, Professor Van Pelt"
436,"00:26:04,438","00:26:06,771","had come in search
of the fabled Jaguar Shrine"
437,"00:26:06,940","00:26:09,729",resting place of the sacred jewel of Jumanji.
438,"00:26:10,778","00:26:12,300","As you know better than anyone,"
439,"00:26:12,325","00:26:14,091",the jewel was his great obsession.
440,"00:26:14,339","00:26:15,675","And after years of research,"
441,"00:26:15,700","00:26:18,453","he believed that he had
discovered its whereabouts."
442,"00:26:18,527","00:26:19,734",Could it be?
443,"00:26:20,204","00:26:21,666",Have I finally found it?
444,"00:26:22,873","00:26:25,490","Van Pelt told me
that he wanted to find the jewel"
445,"00:26:25,667","00:26:27,829",in order to document it in his writings.
446,"00:26:30,589","00:26:32,922","It's real!
What I did not know"
447,"00:26:33,092","00:26:36,161","was that he intended
to take the jewel for himself."
448,"00:26:45,479","00:26:47,041",I found it.
449,"00:26:48,190","00:26:51,384",I found it!
450,"00:26:54,154","00:26:57,192","Legend tells
that the Jaguar watches over Jumanji"
451,"00:26:57,366","00:27:02,512","and anyone who dares to blind him
will be consumed by a dark power."
452,"00:27:04,206","00:27:08,166","Van Pelt assumed dominion
over all of Jumanji's creatures"
453,"00:27:08,335","00:27:11,324","possessing them, controlling them."
454,"00:27:11,797","00:27:15,941","And a terrible curse befell
this once-placid land."
455,"00:27:17,803","00:27:21,672","I begged him to put it back,
but once he had it in his grasp"
456,"00:27:21,849","00:27:23,662",he could never let it go.
457,"00:27:25,769","00:27:28,257","So I waited till they slept that night,"
458,"00:27:28,730","00:27:30,187",and I made my move.
459,"00:27:52,379","00:27:54,312",Bring me that jewel!
460,"00:27:54,882","00:27:57,596","And slaughter anyone
who tries to stop you."
461,"00:27:59,303","00:28:00,965","Right, then. Here you go."
462,"00:28:02,848","00:28:04,965",With the invaluable help of your associates
463,"00:28:05,142","00:28:08,852","you must use your complementary skills
to return the jewel to the Jaguar's eye"
464,"00:28:09,021","00:28:11,138",and lift the curse.
465,"00:28:11,315","00:28:13,352",I'm sure you'll want to get started right away.
466,"00:28:13,942","00:28:15,478","Actually, I think...
Good luck!"
467,"00:28:15,652","00:28:17,439",The fate of Jumanji is in your hands.
468,"00:28:19,781","00:28:21,017","What?
And remember."
469,"00:28:21,241","00:28:23,574","The goal for you, I'll recite in verse."
470,"00:28:23,744","00:28:25,986",Return the jewel and lift the curse.
471,"00:28:26,163","00:28:27,779",If you wish to leave the game.
472,"00:28:27,956","00:28:31,145","You must save Jumanji,
and call out its name."
473,"00:28:32,377","00:28:35,165","Good luck!
The fate of Jumanji is in your hands."
474,"00:28:35,339","00:28:37,672","And remember.
He's saying the same thing over."
475,"00:28:37,841","00:28:39,127",I'll recite in verse.
476,"00:28:39,301","00:28:41,088",Return the jewel and lift the curse.
477,"00:28:41,261","00:28:42,797",If you wish to leave the game.
478,"00:28:42,971","00:28:46,060","You must save Jumanji,
and call out its name."
479,"00:28:49,770","00:28:50,704",It's Ok.
480,"00:28:51,229","00:28:53,329","You can handle this.
In real life, people love you."
481,"00:28:53,373","00:28:55,060",You can hook up with anyone you want.
482,"00:28:55,234","00:28:57,041","Is that what you tell yourself
when you're scared?"
483,"00:28:57,611","00:28:59,954",Can you not judge me for two seconds?
484,"00:28:59,955","00:29:02,088","I split up with Noah,
I turned into a guy,"
485,"00:29:02,157","00:29:04,649","and I cannot find my phone.
I am allowed to be upset."
486,"00:29:04,826","00:29:05,872","Dr. Bravestone,"
487,"00:29:05,897","00:29:07,739",here's a map of Jumanji.
488,"00:29:08,222","00:29:10,409","You must go to the bazaar
and find the missing piece."
489,"00:29:10,791","00:29:12,503","The bazaar.
Missing piece of what?"
490,"00:29:12,876","00:29:13,704",Cheerio!
491,"00:29:13,705","00:29:15,632",You can't give us a ride to the statue?
492,"00:29:15,657","00:29:16,686",And remember.
493,"00:29:16,838","00:29:18,625",If you wish to leave the game.
494,"00:29:18,799","00:29:22,009","You must save Jumanji,
and call out its name."
495,"00:29:30,060","00:29:31,792",You want to put this in there?
496,"00:29:32,162","00:29:33,223",No.
497,"00:29:33,397","00:29:35,610","Come on, you're the only one
with a backpack, Fridge."
498,"00:29:37,442","00:29:40,685","So what? We have a map.
So now we're supposed to go and find?"
499,"00:29:40,862","00:29:42,444","The bazaar, I guess?"
500,"00:29:42,614","00:29:45,322","So we return the jewel to the Jaguar statue,"
501,"00:29:45,492","00:29:47,905","and, and then we go home.
No problem."
502,"00:29:47,929","00:29:51,867","Why can't we just leave, stop the game,
without doing all this stuff?"
503,"00:29:52,541","00:29:54,373",We have to finish the game.
504,"00:29:55,669","00:29:56,751",I think...
505,"00:29:58,672","00:30:00,680",I think we have to save Jumanji.
506,"00:30:09,641","00:30:12,109","Damn, that is a man right there."
507,"00:30:14,938","00:30:17,597","Don't cry, don't cry, don't cry,
don't cry, don't cry."
508,"00:30:19,067","00:30:20,129",Don't cry.
509,"00:30:21,611","00:30:23,603",There are so many diseases out here.
510,"00:30:24,281","00:30:25,442",It's hot.
511,"00:30:25,949","00:30:27,906","Ok, this is what I'm good at."
512,"00:30:28,076","00:30:29,252",Playing video games.
513,"00:30:29,277","00:30:30,174",It's what I do.
514,"00:30:30,499","00:30:32,710",It's literally the main thing that I do.
515,"00:30:32,831","00:30:34,888","Play a game like this, there'll be levels."
516,"00:30:34,958","00:30:37,245","In order to finish the game,
you gotta complete all the levels."
517,"00:30:37,619","00:30:39,536","Levels are gonna get harder
as we go along."
518,"00:30:39,560","00:30:40,702","We complete the levels...
Spencer,"
519,"00:30:40,726","00:30:41,905",do you even know where we're going?
520,"00:30:42,758","00:30:43,663",Kind of.
521,"00:30:43,688","00:30:44,688",Kind of?
522,"00:30:44,968","00:30:46,100","Oh, that's good, then."
523,"00:30:46,325","00:30:47,556",We're in good hands.
524,"00:30:47,804","00:30:50,447","Ok, the missing piece, I'm guessing."
525,"00:30:50,724","00:30:53,684","Oh my God, that must be what we're looking
for, the missing piece of the map."
526,"00:30:53,685","00:30:55,517","But the problem is, there's nothing here."
527,"00:30:58,065","00:31:00,682","What do you mean?
It's a map, just like he said."
528,"00:31:01,443","00:31:02,650",It's a map of Jumanji.
529,"00:31:04,279","00:31:05,520",Cartography.
530,"00:31:05,997","00:31:07,654","What's that?
The study of maps."
531,"00:31:07,724","00:31:09,400",It was one of Professor Oberon's skills.
532,"00:31:09,424","00:31:10,662","Yes.
That's right."
533,"00:31:10,735","00:31:13,594","Oh, so you can't see this, but I can?"
534,"00:31:13,663","00:31:15,880","The characters we chose,
we all have certain skills."
535,"00:31:16,416","00:31:18,329",So there's gotta be a way to access our...
536,"00:31:23,965","00:31:25,054",What'd you just do?
537,"00:31:25,078","00:31:26,658",Strengths: Fearless.
538,"00:31:26,683","00:31:27,472",Climbing.
539,"00:31:27,594","00:31:28,269",Speed.
540,"00:31:28,494","00:31:29,430",Boomerang.
541,"00:31:29,679","00:31:31,671",Smoldering intensity.
542,"00:31:35,435","00:31:36,647",What the hell are you doing?
543,"00:31:37,813","00:31:38,837",What just happened?
544,"00:31:39,662","00:31:40,925",You just smoldered.
545,"00:31:42,150","00:31:43,186",Weakness.
546,"00:31:44,986","00:31:45,986",None?
547,"00:31:46,196","00:31:47,570",How'd you do that?
548,"00:31:47,695","00:31:48,687",That... That list?
549,"00:31:49,032","00:31:52,074","Well, I just... I. I think
I just pressed my, my..."
550,"00:31:52,899","00:31:54,302",enormous left pec.
551,"00:31:54,454","00:31:56,406","It's like the boob area.
Let me show you."
552,"00:31:56,431","00:31:57,266",Get away from me.
553,"00:31:57,707","00:32:01,075","At least press it in front of us,
so we know exactly how."
554,"00:32:01,670","00:32:05,784","Strengths: Karate. T'ai chi.
Aikido. Dance fighting?"
555,"00:32:06,341","00:32:08,628",Dance fighting? Is that even a... thing?
556,"00:32:09,261","00:32:10,468",Weakness:
557,"00:32:10,637","00:32:11,653",Venom.
558,"00:32:14,599","00:32:15,760",Seriously?
559,"00:32:18,270","00:32:20,136","Paleontology.
What does that even mean?"
560,"00:32:20,313","00:32:22,776","Study of fossils, I think."
561,"00:32:23,150","00:32:24,155",That's kind of cool.
562,"00:32:24,180","00:32:25,837",Says the gorgeous karate badass
563,"00:32:25,986","00:32:28,399","to the old fossil guy
who doesn't have any endurance."
564,"00:32:33,618","00:32:34,754",I hate this game.
565,"00:32:35,028","00:32:37,236",Weakness: Cake.
566,"00:32:37,622","00:32:40,160","Yes, cake is my weakness."
567,"00:32:40,333","00:32:42,620",Along with speed and strength.
568,"00:32:43,879","00:32:45,791",Strength is my weakness.
569,"00:32:45,964","00:32:47,881","Hey, can I? Quick question."
570,"00:32:48,258","00:32:49,999",How is strength my weakness?
571,"00:32:50,469","00:32:51,839",Somebody explain that to me.
572,"00:32:51,864","00:32:53,281",And why would I need speed?
573,"00:32:53,430","00:32:55,797","Why would I need to be fast
when I'm being chased"
574,"00:32:55,974","00:32:59,333","by an enormous killer zebra
or some shit in this dumb-ass hat?"
575,"00:32:59,603","00:33:02,070",You're also a good weapons valet.
576,"00:33:02,147","00:33:03,351",What does that mean?
577,"00:33:03,476","00:33:05,039","Well, I think it means"
578,"00:33:05,192","00:33:07,024","you carry my weapons
in your backpack"
579,"00:33:07,194","00:33:10,303","and you give them to me
when and if I need them?"
580,"00:33:12,032","00:33:13,155",You guys.
581,"00:33:13,180","00:33:16,175","The map, it's changing."
582,"00:33:16,328","00:33:17,794","What do you mean?
What's it say?"
583,"00:33:17,971","00:33:20,088","Ok, well, there's not a lot of information."
584,"00:33:20,165","00:33:23,203","But a minute ago,
it didn't say this and now it does."
585,"00:33:23,376","00:33:26,460","It says, The Mighty Roar."
586,"00:33:34,554","00:33:35,820",I don't like that.
587,"00:33:36,097","00:33:37,051",I'm done.
588,"00:33:37,376","00:33:38,376",What else?
589,"00:33:38,377","00:33:39,692","Ok. And right here,"
590,"00:33:39,882","00:33:41,532",it says From The Deep.
591,"00:33:42,003","00:33:43,610",The hippo came from the deep.
592,"00:33:43,835","00:33:44,835","The one that...
Yes."
593,"00:33:44,981","00:33:46,022",The thing that did the thing.
594,"00:33:46,046","00:33:47,042",That's it. Moving on.
595,"00:33:47,734","00:33:49,835","So if From The Deep is the first level,"
596,"00:33:49,836","00:33:52,169","then, then The Mighty Roar
must be the second level."
597,"00:33:52,697","00:33:53,733",Which way?
598,"00:33:54,783","00:33:55,783",Ok.
599,"00:33:56,409","00:33:58,617",If that is that
600,"00:33:59,996","00:34:01,629",and that is here.
601,"00:34:03,291","00:34:04,727","Right here, I think."
602,"00:34:18,431","00:34:19,547",What is this game?
603,"00:34:21,434","00:34:22,495",Run!
604,"00:34:25,146","00:34:26,212",Wait!
605,"00:34:44,082","00:34:45,744","Come on, legs!"
606,"00:34:48,528","00:34:49,960",Why am I running so slow?
607,"00:34:56,136","00:34:57,968","Oh, my God, oh, my God, oh, my God!"
608,"00:35:03,893","00:35:05,009",This sucks!
609,"00:35:06,354","00:35:07,890",Split up!
610,"00:35:21,995","00:35:23,106","Oh, my God."
611,"00:35:46,478","00:35:47,478",Come on!
612,"00:35:47,687","00:35:49,494","Those guys have huge guns.
Really?"
613,"00:35:49,564","00:35:50,850","Is that what those are, Spencer?"
614,"00:35:51,024","00:35:52,060","Let me see your backpack.
For what?"
615,"00:35:52,233","00:35:54,246","Inside your backpack,
you have my weapons."
616,"00:35:54,819","00:35:55,830",Get down.
617,"00:35:58,990","00:36:00,323",Got your weapons?
618,"00:36:01,493","00:36:03,860","I can't feel no...
What's this?"
619,"00:36:04,037","00:36:06,199","Oh, yes.
Boomerang, it's one of my strengths."
620,"00:36:06,373","00:36:07,461",What are you gonna do with it?
621,"00:36:07,586","00:36:09,089","I don't know.
Kill them, I guess."
622,"00:36:09,314","00:36:10,231",You Kill them with that?
623,"00:36:10,255","00:36:11,399",You got a better idea?
624,"00:36:11,724","00:36:12,884","Oh, watch yourself."
625,"00:36:14,422","00:36:15,458",Watch this.
626,"00:36:19,594","00:36:20,860","Nice work.
There!"
627,"00:36:21,680","00:36:25,299","Want me to see if I got a hacky sack
for you to throw and do nothing with?"
628,"00:36:39,614","00:36:41,071","Wait, wait.
Oh, no."
629,"00:36:47,122","00:36:48,108",It worked.
630,"00:36:50,458","00:36:51,849",Here they come. We gotta go.
631,"00:36:52,127","00:36:53,618",I can't outrun those guys.
632,"00:36:55,630","00:36:56,837",We gotta go now!
633,"00:36:57,006","00:36:58,843","Get on my back.
I would rather die."
634,"00:36:58,867","00:37:00,614","Jump on my back!
Nope. Nope. I'll die."
635,"00:37:00,635","00:37:01,716",Put me down!
636,"00:37:02,220","00:37:03,234",Spencer!
637,"00:37:03,959","00:37:05,207",Put me down!
638,"00:37:17,193","00:37:19,010",You have got to be kidding me.
639,"00:37:20,780","00:37:22,393","Oh, no, no, no, no, no!"
640,"00:37:27,287","00:37:28,352",We have to jump!
641,"00:37:28,453","00:37:29,503",Are you out of your mind?
642,"00:37:29,527","00:37:31,548","I would rather do anything
else right now but that."
643,"00:37:31,624","00:37:32,785",Jump!
644,"00:37:33,668","00:37:35,284","Martha!
Jump!"
645,"00:37:38,882","00:37:40,919","We gotta jump!
We don't know how deep that water is."
646,"00:37:41,092","00:37:42,833","We gotta go! Spencer, you will jump!
No, no!"
647,"00:37:43,011","00:37:44,593","You gonna jump. Jump!
No!"
648,"00:38:05,992","00:38:07,483",I think I'm having a coronary.
649,"00:38:07,660","00:38:09,196",I'm having difficulty breathing.
650,"00:38:09,370","00:38:11,508","That was the most humiliating
moment of my life."
651,"00:38:12,081","00:38:13,148",Don't you do that again.
652,"00:38:13,573","00:38:15,023",I took in a lot of water.
653,"00:38:20,381","00:38:21,563",They got me.
654,"00:38:22,926","00:38:23,942","Oh, no."
655,"00:38:25,011","00:38:26,102",Martha?
656,"00:38:31,226","00:38:32,244",Hey wait!
657,"00:38:32,469","00:38:33,460",What just happened to her?
658,"00:38:33,484","00:38:35,444",Is she dead? Did she die?
659,"00:38:38,733","00:38:39,840",Wait a second.
660,"00:38:41,110","00:38:42,776",What the hell is hap...
661,"00:38:44,489","00:38:46,321","Get off of my back!
Are you Ok?"
662,"00:38:46,491","00:38:47,648","I think so.
Off of me!"
663,"00:38:47,773","00:38:49,428","Goodness gracious, get off!"
664,"00:38:49,577","00:38:52,015","I'm getting off of you.
Anybody care if I'm Ok?"
665,"00:38:52,288","00:38:54,120","What am I, a human landing pad?"
666,"00:38:57,210","00:38:58,542",That's what I thought.
667,"00:38:58,711","00:39:00,234","We each have three lives, guys."
668,"00:39:00,259","00:39:01,978",These little tattoos on our arms.
669,"00:39:03,216","00:39:05,333","Jesus, would you look
at the size of that thing?"
670,"00:39:05,610","00:39:07,267","Spencer!
What?"
671,"00:39:07,637","00:39:08,802",You were saying?
672,"00:39:09,027","00:39:10,904",It's. It's our life count.
673,"00:39:11,057","00:39:13,665","Bethany got eaten by a hippo,
so now she only has two lines."
674,"00:39:13,768","00:39:14,825",He's right.
675,"00:39:15,687","00:39:18,121","Wait. What happens
if we use up all our lives?"
676,"00:39:20,358","00:39:21,766","Well, usually that would mean..."
677,"00:39:24,153","00:39:25,485",game over.
678,"00:39:25,655","00:39:27,171","What do you mean, game over?"
679,"00:39:27,782","00:39:29,969","Are you saying
that we can actually die in here?"
680,"00:39:30,243","00:39:32,510","I mean, I don't know for sure, but...
You're not sure?"
681,"00:39:32,787","00:39:34,574","You're not sure,
Mr. Video-Game-Genius?"
682,"00:39:34,747","00:39:36,454","I've never been stuck in one, Ok?"
683,"00:39:36,624","00:39:39,545","So I'm not certain, but, yes, I'm afraid..."
684,"00:39:40,270","00:39:41,709",we all could die.
685,"00:39:43,756","00:39:45,573",That is my big concern right now.
686,"00:39:50,513","00:39:52,296","We better find the missing piece, then."
687,"00:39:53,141","00:39:54,141",Ok.
688,"00:39:57,729","00:40:00,397","It looks like there's a village
on the other side of this mountain."
689,"00:40:00,773","00:40:02,180",Maybe that's the bazaar.
690,"00:40:02,817","00:40:03,817",Let's do it.
691,"00:40:03,841","00:40:04,841",Wait.
692,"00:40:06,279","00:40:08,111",I gotta take a leak first.
693,"00:40:09,073","00:40:10,770","I've been dreading this all day,"
694,"00:40:11,395","00:40:12,662",but so do I.
695,"00:40:13,953","00:40:16,146","Can I come with you
and you show me how it's done?"
696,"00:40:18,041","00:40:19,378",I may need your help.
697,"00:40:21,002","00:40:22,263","Yeah, sure. Sure."
698,"00:40:22,588","00:40:23,834","Yeah, I'm..."
699,"00:40:24,059","00:40:25,135",I'll help you out.
700,"00:40:28,635","00:40:30,268",So how do we do this?
701,"00:40:31,137","00:40:32,344",Easy. You just...
702,"00:40:32,513","00:40:34,900","You unzip, take it out, fire away."
703,"00:40:35,350","00:40:36,552",Remember to aim.
704,"00:40:37,577","00:40:38,817",It's very important.
705,"00:40:41,189","00:40:44,632","Oh my God, you guys there's like literally
a penis attached to my body right now."
706,"00:40:44,809","00:40:46,366","Martha, come look at my penis!"
707,"00:40:46,736","00:40:47,968","No, thanks."
708,"00:40:48,237","00:40:49,958",Is this the first that you've seen it?
709,"00:40:49,983","00:40:51,129",Yes. I didn't wanna look.
710,"00:40:51,482","00:40:53,870","I looked at mine within
the first 20 seconds of getting here."
711,"00:40:54,243","00:40:57,357","I'm happy to report that I was able
to bring one thing from the outside world."
712,"00:40:59,123","00:41:00,659",What? Are you? What are you doing?
713,"00:41:00,833","00:41:02,049","Are you looking?
Sorry."
714,"00:41:02,126","00:41:04,558","You don't look over here!
Yeah, you never look."
715,"00:41:04,583","00:41:05,393",It's a thing.
716,"00:41:05,964","00:41:07,521","Ok, good boy."
717,"00:41:07,790","00:41:10,578","We'll take this nice and slow,
and nobody will get hurt."
718,"00:41:10,751","00:41:12,183","Now what?
Now blast off."
719,"00:41:12,553","00:41:14,145",And aim. Don't forget to aim.
720,"00:41:14,170","00:41:16,036","What is with you and the aiming?
What happened to you?"
721,"00:41:16,182","00:41:17,673","Can we not talk about this
in mixed company?"
722,"00:41:20,645","00:41:23,058","Oh, this is so much easier!"
723,"00:41:23,731","00:41:24,695","It's cool, right?"
724,"00:41:24,720","00:41:27,044","Yeah, because you
have, like, a handle."
725,"00:41:28,152","00:41:31,065","The fact that I'm not Instagramming this
right now is insane."
726,"00:41:34,325","00:41:36,133","This looks all right.
Up ahead!"
727,"00:41:56,806","00:41:58,092",Bravestone.
728,"00:41:58,850","00:42:00,057",Him and that whole lot.
729,"00:42:01,519","00:42:02,600",They got away?
730,"00:42:03,896","00:42:05,182",We lost them in the jungle.
731,"00:42:06,107","00:42:07,514",I should have known.
732,"00:42:10,486","00:42:12,144","How do you mean, sir?"
733,"00:42:13,114","00:42:16,027","I will summon every creature
and every soldier"
734,"00:42:16,200","00:42:17,892",to hunt them down.
735,"00:42:18,369","00:42:20,607",Reclaim what is mine.
736,"00:42:24,709","00:42:25,950",Find them.
737,"00:42:29,922","00:42:31,458","Be careful of the ground, guys."
738,"00:42:31,832","00:42:34,045","It's really uneven.
I'd hate for anybody to twist an ankle."
739,"00:42:34,218","00:42:36,676","I did that once at camp...
Could you please stop talking?"
740,"00:42:36,846","00:42:38,678","Ok, sure. No problem.
Please!"
741,"00:42:38,848","00:42:40,635","Can I borrow your jacket?
Yeah, sure."
742,"00:42:40,808","00:42:41,844","Thanks.
What are you doing?"
743,"00:42:42,018","00:42:44,556",I feel like I'm wearing a bikini at school.
744,"00:42:44,729","00:42:47,062","I did that once.
They sent me to the office."
745,"00:42:47,331","00:42:47,934",Of course.
746,"00:42:47,959","00:42:49,968",Noah likes it when I show some skin.
747,"00:42:49,992","00:42:51,755",It's like the key to our relationship.
748,"00:42:53,696","00:42:54,769",Judgy much?
749,"00:42:55,094","00:42:57,313","Seriously, I can't even
open my mouth around you."
750,"00:42:57,366","00:43:00,580","You don't even know me,
but you, like, decided you hate me."
751,"00:43:00,953","00:43:03,070","Oh, wait a minute.
I don't hate you."
752,"00:43:05,041","00:43:06,113",You don't?
753,"00:43:06,438","00:43:07,173",No.
754,"00:43:07,418","00:43:08,260",Look I...
755,"00:43:08,485","00:43:10,910","I just think you live in, like,
the hot popular girl bubble."
756,"00:43:10,963","00:43:13,699","You know, where everybody either
treats you like a princess or,"
757,"00:43:13,723","00:43:14,902",like an object.
758,"00:43:15,051","00:43:16,581",Maybe it makes you a little...
759,"00:43:17,306","00:43:19,415",self-absorbed or something?
760,"00:43:23,226","00:43:24,388",That's fair.
761,"00:43:25,061","00:43:27,394","But do you think maybe
the reason why you're so..."
762,"00:43:27,763","00:43:30,781","judgy is because you're like afraid
people aren't gonna like you"
763,"00:43:30,858","00:43:32,815",so you decide not to like them first?
764,"00:43:33,277","00:43:34,413",No.
765,"00:43:36,072","00:43:37,706",Maybe. Maybe.
766,"00:43:40,076","00:43:41,263","Ok, then."
767,"00:43:42,328","00:43:44,820","I'm just saying, you're a babe. Own it."
768,"00:43:47,125","00:43:48,141",Thanks.
769,"00:43:48,918","00:43:49,959",I guess.
770,"00:43:58,094","00:43:59,504",So sick of this game.
771,"00:43:59,629","00:44:01,011","Just stay out of my way, Spencer."
772,"00:44:01,035","00:44:02,847","What are you so mad at me for?
Why am I mad?"
773,"00:44:03,015","00:44:04,597",Are you seriously asking me that?
774,"00:44:04,767","00:44:06,303",You got me kicked off the team.
775,"00:44:06,477","00:44:08,190",Then you got me stuck in whatever...
776,"00:44:08,515","00:44:09,790",Whatever this is.
777,"00:44:09,939","00:44:11,952","And you wonder
why we not friends no more."
778,"00:44:12,525","00:44:15,436","Oh this is why we are not friends anymore?
Because you didn't want to get stuck in Jumanji?"
779,"00:44:15,461","00:44:16,527",I don't think so.
780,"00:44:16,904","00:44:19,567","We're not friends because I'm not
cool enough to hang out with you,"
781,"00:44:19,940","00:44:21,902","so you pretended
not to know me anymore."
782,"00:44:22,076","00:44:24,944","Until you needed me to do you homework
because you couldn't do it yourself."
783,"00:44:25,121","00:44:27,909","I wonder you don't know anything
about Westword Expansion."
784,"00:44:28,082","00:44:29,139","Ok, you see that?"
785,"00:44:29,364","00:44:30,473",You know what?
786,"00:44:30,626","00:44:32,162","I'm not stupid, Spencer."
787,"00:44:32,336","00:44:34,482",I asked you to do me one simple favor.
788,"00:44:34,507","00:44:36,877","I said do my homework,
so I don't get kicked off the team,"
789,"00:44:36,902","00:44:37,988",and you messed that up.
790,"00:44:38,334","00:44:41,428","Now I can't do the one thing that
I'm actually good at, and it's all your fault."
791,"00:44:43,014","00:44:44,851",I should kick the shit out you right now.
792,"00:44:53,441","00:44:55,428","I'd like to see you try.
What did you say?"
793,"00:44:57,987","00:44:59,570","Oh, Ok."
794,"00:45:00,656","00:45:02,400",I see what's going on here.
795,"00:45:02,525","00:45:03,916","Guys.
Oh you think 'cause you,"
796,"00:45:04,141","00:45:05,726","you are what 6.4 - 6.5,"
797,"00:45:06,078","00:45:08,661","270 pounds of pure muscle,
I'm supposed to be afraid of you?"
798,"00:45:08,831","00:45:09,938",Is that what you think?
799,"00:45:11,876","00:45:12,912",Maybe.
800,"00:45:17,548","00:45:18,835",Let me tell you something.
801,"00:45:19,508","00:45:22,626","You're the same annoying kid I've been
trying to shake since seventh grade."
802,"00:45:24,555","00:45:26,017",Ain't nothing changed.
803,"00:45:26,390","00:45:28,724","Don't let this new body get
your butt whupped."
804,"00:45:34,941","00:45:36,022",Dumb-ass.
805,"00:45:42,156","00:45:43,663","No!
Spencer!"
806,"00:45:44,033","00:45:45,149",Spencer!
807,"00:45:45,993","00:45:48,235","You killed him!
Fridge, you lunatic!"
808,"00:45:48,412","00:45:50,324",Chill out. He'll be back.
809,"00:46:08,432","00:46:10,014",Don't call me a dumb-ass.
810,"00:46:11,102","00:46:12,494",Don't push me.
811,"00:46:13,271","00:46:14,478","Or what, Spencer?"
812,"00:46:14,647","00:46:16,354",Or I'll push you back.
813,"00:46:29,203","00:46:30,364",Did you just smack me?
814,"00:46:32,039","00:46:33,555",You gonna smack me?
815,"00:46:33,833","00:46:35,750","Fridge, no.
Yeah, yeah."
816,"00:46:36,419","00:46:38,001",Yeah. You wanna smack...
817,"00:46:39,839","00:46:41,375","Oh, no, no, no!"
818,"00:46:42,800","00:46:43,882",Enough.
819,"00:46:44,969","00:46:46,280",We can't waste lives.
820,"00:46:47,555","00:46:49,046",We need each other.
821,"00:46:49,598","00:46:50,801","Like it or not,"
822,"00:46:51,326","00:46:53,617",we have to do this together.
823,"00:46:57,231","00:46:58,972",Could you say that one more time?
824,"00:46:59,250","00:47:01,663","We have to do this together?
But with the smolder."
825,"00:47:01,736","00:47:04,649","Do you have control of that,
or does that happen naturally?"
826,"00:47:05,614","00:47:07,576",It just happens naturally.
827,"00:47:37,438","00:47:39,851","What are we supposed to be doing?
Looking for the missing map piece."
828,"00:47:40,024","00:47:41,606",So we just start asking for it?
829,"00:47:41,776","00:47:46,237","No, I just think we look around, we scope
the place out, but most importantly, guys"
830,"00:47:46,405","00:47:48,112",be discreet.
831,"00:47:49,241","00:47:51,904",Rashans! Get your Rashans!
832,"00:47:52,078","00:47:54,261","Does anyone have any like money?
I'm literally starving."
833,"00:47:54,330","00:47:57,368",Rashans! Get your Rashans!
834,"00:47:57,541","00:47:58,828",Rashans!
835,"00:48:00,002","00:48:03,191","Guys, I think the game is trying to tell us
to keep our health up."
836,"00:48:04,507","00:48:06,624","We need to eat.
Ok, stop doing that."
837,"00:48:07,343","00:48:10,302","This is so good. I haven't had bread
since I was, like, 9."
838,"00:48:10,471","00:48:11,449",Are you serious?
839,"00:48:11,474","00:48:12,813",How do you think I got these abs?
840,"00:48:13,766","00:48:15,053",Let me try some of that.
841,"00:48:19,605","00:48:20,728","Wait, what..."
842,"00:48:20,753","00:48:21,962",What is this?
843,"00:48:22,108","00:48:23,499",That's my famous pound cake.
844,"00:48:24,110","00:48:25,242",Cake?
845,"00:48:26,404","00:48:28,120","Bethany, you said this was bread."
846,"00:48:28,397","00:48:30,163","I guess it's been so long
I've forgot what it tastes like."
847,"00:48:30,241","00:48:31,332",How do you forget what...
848,"00:48:32,401","00:48:33,767","What's happening,
something happening to me?"
849,"00:48:34,036","00:48:35,672","No.
Am I Am I shaking?"
850,"00:48:36,539","00:48:37,850","Am I breaking out?
No."
851,"00:48:39,083","00:48:40,920","Am I still black?
Yes."
852,"00:48:41,794","00:48:44,832","Ok. Ok, right?"
853,"00:48:45,005","00:48:46,962",We're fine. Everything is fine.
854,"00:48:47,133","00:48:48,373","Yeah, no, no, no, it's Ok."
855,"00:48:48,398","00:48:50,500","It probably just meant
that I love cake."
856,"00:48:50,553","00:48:52,394",That I couldn't resist it. Yeah.
857,"00:48:52,419","00:48:53,741","Hey, it's all good..."
858,"00:49:08,028","00:49:09,269",God!
859,"00:49:12,158","00:49:13,899",What the hell?!
860,"00:49:14,910","00:49:16,993","Like I said, important to be discreet."
861,"00:49:17,163","00:49:19,450","Hey, you also said eat.
Rashans,"
862,"00:49:19,623","00:49:21,710","Get your...
You better shut your ass up!"
863,"00:49:23,461","00:49:25,733","Dr. Bravestone.
Thank goodness you're here."
864,"00:49:25,757","00:49:27,024",Jumanji needs you.
865,"00:49:28,382","00:49:29,109",Thanks.
866,"00:49:29,734","00:49:30,898",Good to be here.
867,"00:49:31,051","00:49:32,289",Ask about the missing piece.
868,"00:49:32,814","00:49:34,714","Oh, right. Hi. I'm Bethany."
869,"00:49:34,963","00:49:37,626","I mean... Professor Shelly, something."
870,"00:49:37,700","00:49:39,066","I'm a map doctor,"
871,"00:49:39,143","00:49:41,760","and I have this map that,
like, has a missing piece."
872,"00:49:43,063","00:49:46,306","Dr. Bravestone. Thank goodness
you're here. Jumanji needs you."
873,"00:49:46,684","00:49:47,691",Rude.
874,"00:49:48,277","00:49:50,189",We need to find the missing piece.
875,"00:50:24,355","00:50:27,198",What you need is in the basket.
876,"00:50:27,775","00:50:30,267","One false move, you're in a casket."
877,"00:50:30,653","00:50:33,317","Trust one another, and never blink."
878,"00:50:34,823","00:50:37,566",The missing piece is not what you think.
879,"00:50:38,702","00:50:39,809",Oy vey.
880,"00:50:40,079","00:50:41,591","Good luck, mighty hero."
881,"00:50:42,164","00:50:44,121","Jumanji needs you.
Jumanji needs him. We know."
882,"00:50:44,291","00:50:46,032",You said it several times.
883,"00:50:52,307","00:50:53,343",So...
884,"00:50:53,968","00:50:55,275",thinking there's a...
885,"00:50:56,428","00:50:58,364",snake in there or something?
886,"00:50:58,514","00:50:59,514",Yep.
887,"00:50:59,974","00:51:01,671",Sounds like a Bravestone thing to me.
888,"00:51:01,796","00:51:03,292",Why would this be a Bravestone thing?
889,"00:51:03,443","00:51:05,030","Because you are a mighty hero.
You heard what he said."
890,"00:51:05,104","00:51:06,766","Jumanji needs you. Now, get."
891,"00:51:22,746","00:51:24,494",I don't wanna do this!
892,"00:51:24,719","00:51:25,604",Just go.
893,"00:51:47,229","00:51:48,470",Black mamba!
894,"00:51:49,982","00:51:51,143",That's a black mamba.
895,"00:51:51,317","00:51:53,183","A quarter milligram of its venom
is enough to kill an adult."
896,"00:51:53,360","00:51:54,896","You'll feel a tingling sensation
in your mouth"
897,"00:51:55,070","00:51:57,079","and extremities, followed by a
fever, foaming at the mouth"
898,"00:51:57,080","00:51:58,938","and ataxia, which means
loss of muscle control."
899,"00:51:59,408","00:52:00,650",How do I know that?
900,"00:52:00,675","00:52:01,719",What do we do?
901,"00:52:01,869","00:52:03,685","Did you see anything else in there?
I didn't see, I didn't have time."
902,"00:52:04,162","00:52:05,162","Oh, my God.
Ok."
903,"00:52:05,186","00:52:07,522","Trust one another and never blink.
Never blink."
904,"00:52:08,208","00:52:09,010",You guys...
905,"00:52:09,235","00:52:11,075",I think it's a staring contest.
906,"00:52:11,128","00:52:12,460","What?
What are you talking about?"
907,"00:52:12,484","00:52:15,213","Think about it. Never blink?
Guys, I think she is right."
908,"00:52:15,582","00:52:18,145","At camp, they used to tell us
if you see a rattlesnake, don't move."
909,"00:52:18,218","00:52:20,581","I think someone has
to make direct eye contact"
910,"00:52:21,055","00:52:21,813",and not blink.
911,"00:52:21,838","00:52:23,571",And then Spencer will reach in
912,"00:52:23,724","00:52:26,057","and grab whatever else is in there.
Why me again?"
913,"00:52:26,226","00:52:28,313","Because you're Bravestone.
Ok, fine."
914,"00:52:28,687","00:52:30,725",Who's good at staring and not blinking?
915,"00:52:34,026","00:52:35,342",I'm amazing at it.
916,"00:52:35,861","00:52:37,102",Then this is your moment.
917,"00:52:40,532","00:52:41,798","Come on, Bethany."
918,"00:52:51,877","00:52:52,993",Just say when.
919,"00:52:55,923","00:52:56,959",Now.
920,"00:53:07,434","00:53:08,496",What do we do?
921,"00:53:12,398","00:53:14,139","You gotta defang it.
I gotta what?"
922,"00:53:16,318","00:53:19,482","You got to pull his mouth back from
the blindspot to disorient it,"
923,"00:53:19,655","00:53:21,487","But be very careful
of the venom gland"
924,"00:53:21,657","00:53:23,640","and the exposed
secondary venom duct."
925,"00:53:23,909","00:53:26,026",And then you gotta snap its teeth
926,"00:53:27,996","00:53:29,783",out of its head.
927,"00:53:34,378","00:53:36,836",I guess it wasn't a staring contest.
928,"00:53:37,005","00:53:39,618",Trust each other and never blink.
929,"00:53:40,759","00:53:41,941",You trusted me.
930,"00:53:42,511","00:53:44,543","You trusted me,
and I defanged the snake."
931,"00:53:44,763","00:53:46,750","I did it. I did that.
Yeah."
932,"00:53:47,516","00:53:49,599","Yeah, you did it.
Thank you."
933,"00:53:50,519","00:53:52,886","Oh, yeah. Sure."
934,"00:54:03,249","00:54:04,340",You guys?
935,"00:54:05,117","00:54:07,304","This does not look like
a piece of a map."
936,"00:54:07,578","00:54:09,461",The missing piece is an elephant?
937,"00:54:10,956","00:54:12,999","Oh, wait, there's something written
on the wrapping paper."
938,"00:54:13,876","00:54:14,886",When you see me...
939,"00:54:15,911","00:54:16,983",begin the climb.
940,"00:54:17,880","00:54:20,873","Begin the climb?
When you see an elephant?"
941,"00:54:23,177","00:54:24,685",I defanged a snake.
942,"00:54:26,972","00:54:29,715","So keep your eyes peeled
for an elephant, I guess?"
943,"00:54:29,892","00:54:31,880",That's like the next level of the game?
944,"00:54:38,692","00:54:39,575",Hey!
945,"00:54:39,800","00:54:40,800",Run!
946,"00:54:45,699","00:54:46,735","Oh, God."
947,"00:54:47,868","00:54:48,976","Watch out!
Hey!"
948,"00:54:52,247","00:54:53,247",Jump!
949,"00:54:53,457","00:54:54,823","Jump.
Go, go, go!"
950,"00:54:55,793","00:54:56,793",Hey!
951,"00:55:03,884","00:55:05,134",I have to warn you...
952,"00:55:05,159","00:55:07,527",I think I'm a very strong puncher.
953,"00:55:08,138","00:55:09,199",Parry.
954,"00:55:10,474","00:55:12,607",Parry. Parry. Evade. Block.
955,"00:55:12,976","00:55:14,012",Uppercut.
956,"00:55:20,442","00:55:22,225",Duck! Headsmash!
957,"00:55:23,949","00:55:25,049",Kapow!
958,"00:55:28,116","00:55:29,799",Duck! Block!
959,"00:55:30,223","00:55:31,323",Kablam!
960,"00:55:33,121","00:55:33,940",Evade!
961,"00:55:34,065","00:55:35,065",Punch!
962,"00:55:35,791","00:55:36,791",Wall toss!
963,"00:55:38,544","00:55:40,661",That is insane.
964,"00:55:48,387","00:55:49,719",Let's do this.
965,"00:55:51,014","00:55:52,050",Do what?
966,"00:55:53,600","00:55:55,317",Put. Put it in my backpack.
967,"00:55:57,187","00:55:58,111",Dodge!
968,"00:55:58,536","00:55:59,536",Headslam!
969,"00:55:59,982","00:56:01,039",Throw through ceiling!
970,"00:56:26,550","00:56:27,882","Hello, doctor."
971,"00:56:28,927","00:56:30,319",Been a long time.
972,"00:56:33,932","00:56:36,800","I believe you have something
that belongs to me."
973,"00:56:38,645","00:56:39,877",We just wanna go home.
974,"00:56:45,611","00:56:47,298",Come on! Come with me! Hurry!
975,"00:56:47,523","00:56:48,373",Get him!
976,"00:56:56,455","00:56:57,455",Come on.
977,"00:57:02,002","00:57:03,765",Down here. Come on. Quick!
978,"00:57:21,980","00:57:23,061",Ok.
979,"00:57:23,732","00:57:26,149","I need you to follow me
and do exactly as I say."
980,"00:57:26,526","00:57:27,542",Let's move.
981,"00:57:29,571","00:57:32,084","Oh, my God, you guys,
I am so stoked you are here."
982,"00:57:32,157","00:57:33,424","You have no idea.
You are?"
983,"00:57:33,848","00:57:34,800",So stoked.
984,"00:57:34,801","00:57:38,385","I mean, I saw you guys in the bazaar,
and I thought to myself, No way."
985,"00:57:38,555","00:57:40,969","And I then I was like, yeah, that's totally...
Backs against the wall!"
986,"00:57:43,585","00:57:44,801","Oh, my goodness!"
987,"00:57:47,464","00:57:48,580",Let's keep moving.
988,"00:57:50,342","00:57:51,658",Watch your step in here.
989,"00:57:51,983","00:57:52,593",Who are you?
990,"00:57:52,594","00:57:54,068","Yeah, and who do you think we are?"
991,"00:57:54,092","00:57:56,007","Right. Sorry, Ok, my bad."
992,"00:57:56,556","00:57:58,092",Let me back up a little bit here.
993,"00:57:58,266","00:58:00,223","Wait, are you the pilot?
Seaplane somebody?"
994,"00:58:00,394","00:58:02,386","Yes. Yeah, that's me.
Wait a minute, wait."
995,"00:58:02,387","00:58:03,844","You're the other character
that was taken."
996,"00:58:04,314","00:58:05,606",So you're in the game too?
997,"00:58:06,483","00:58:08,816","Stay off the white bricks. And freeze.
What?"
998,"00:58:16,326","00:58:17,567",So gnarly.
999,"00:58:18,829","00:58:20,146",This game sucks.
1000,"00:58:30,257","00:58:32,040",All right. Get this plank.
1001,"00:58:37,764","00:58:39,056",Follow me.
1002,"00:58:40,142","00:58:42,155",Careful. It's a horrible way to die.
1003,"00:58:42,728","00:58:43,990","Oh, God."
1004,"00:58:46,523","00:58:47,809",There you go. All right.
1005,"00:58:54,990","00:58:56,031",Come on.
1006,"00:58:57,951","00:59:01,395","I got it, I got it. I just defanged a snake.
Give me a little respect."
1007,"00:59:07,252","00:59:08,252",Ok.
1008,"00:59:18,263","00:59:20,021","Hi there.
Hi."
1009,"00:59:27,105","00:59:28,141",Come on.
1010,"00:59:41,286","00:59:43,578","Anyway, I'm Alex."
1011,"00:59:44,122","00:59:45,579",Spencer Gilpin.
1012,"00:59:46,249","00:59:49,208","Martha, Fridge and Bethany."
1013,"00:59:49,544","00:59:50,253",Bethany?
1014,"00:59:50,578","00:59:51,705",You're a girl?
1015,"00:59:51,755","00:59:52,816",Woman.
1016,"00:59:54,199","00:59:55,607","In real life,
you'd probably wanna hit that."
1017,"01:00:03,391","01:00:04,345",They got away.
1018,"01:00:04,670","01:00:05,923",Looks like they had help.
1019,"01:00:07,229","01:00:08,520",Seaplane.
1020,"01:00:08,897","01:00:10,854",He must've crawled out of his hole.
1021,"01:00:12,275","01:00:13,592","I'm sorry, boss."
1022,"01:00:14,569","01:00:16,026",It won't happen again.
1023,"01:00:19,407","01:00:20,794",I know it won't.
1024,"01:00:36,091","01:00:37,127",What are you making?
1025,"01:00:37,500","01:00:39,442","Margaritas.
It's actually one of my strengths."
1026,"01:00:39,719","01:00:40,824","That and piloting,"
1027,"01:00:40,949","01:00:44,596","although I did get shot down
by a couple orangutans in fighter jets,"
1028,"01:00:44,721","01:00:46,773",so maybe not that great at it.
1029,"01:00:47,769","01:00:49,276","Anyway, cheers."
1030,"01:00:52,315","01:00:53,477","Thanks.
Sure."
1031,"01:00:54,151","01:00:56,034",I've never had alcohol before.
1032,"01:00:56,403","01:00:57,644","Me neither.
You know what?"
1033,"01:00:57,821","01:00:58,862",What the hell?
1034,"01:01:06,163","01:01:07,871","And I'm done with that.
It's good."
1035,"01:01:09,457","01:01:10,789",Can I get one more of those?
1036,"01:01:10,959","01:01:11,995","Alex?
Yeah."
1037,"01:01:12,269","01:01:13,575",What's up with all these candles?
1038,"01:01:13,900","01:01:15,457",Citronella. One of my weaknesses
1039,"01:01:15,505","01:01:16,769",is mosquitoes which...
1040,"01:01:17,094","01:01:20,549","is kind of a bummer when you live
alone in an open hut in the jungle."
1041,"01:01:22,012","01:01:23,048",He's single.
1042,"01:01:24,306","01:01:25,387",Who's this?
1043,"01:01:25,557","01:01:26,798",Who's Alan Parrish?
1044,"01:01:28,185","01:01:29,542",The guy who built this place.
1045,"01:01:30,478","01:01:32,340","Wait, other people have
been stuck here too?"
1046,"01:01:32,814","01:01:35,181","Yeah. This is Alan Parrish's house.
I'm just living in it."
1047,"01:01:35,358","01:01:37,020","So, Alex, tell me"
1048,"01:01:37,819","01:01:39,686",how long have you been in the game?
1049,"01:01:40,363","01:01:41,729","Oh, it's tough to say."
1050,"01:01:41,907","01:01:43,264",Time is kind of funny here.
1051,"01:01:43,288","01:01:44,033",But...
1052,"01:01:44,334","01:01:45,475","a few months, at least."
1053,"01:01:45,552","01:01:46,588","A few months?
What?"
1054,"01:01:46,761","01:01:49,595","Yeah, I just can't see to make it
past the transportation shed."
1055,"01:01:49,764","01:01:51,521","Transportation shed?
What's that?"
1056,"01:01:51,791","01:01:52,932",It's the next level.
1057,"01:01:53,710","01:01:56,127","First time, my hot-air balloon
wouldn't even take off."
1058,"01:01:56,504","01:01:58,917","And then there was
the whole plane thing I mentioned."
1059,"01:02:00,300","01:02:02,739",And once I got down to my last life...
1060,"01:02:04,012","01:02:05,478",I realized I was screwed.
1061,"01:02:06,056","01:02:07,994","And that I was never gonna
get out of here by myself."
1062,"01:02:09,017","01:02:11,455","Half the stuff that came at me,
I had zero way to deal with."
1063,"01:02:11,728","01:02:14,011","You can't kill a black mamba
with a margarita."
1064,"01:02:14,080","01:02:15,229",You sure can't.
1065,"01:02:15,354","01:02:17,118",You need a zoologist for that.
1066,"01:02:19,486","01:02:21,849","Alex, we can help each other."
1067,"01:02:22,322","01:02:24,188","You've been here a long time,
you know the game and,"
1068,"01:02:24,212","01:02:26,278","and between us,
we have a lot of strengths."
1069,"01:02:26,451","01:02:27,179",Yeah.
1070,"01:02:27,804","01:02:29,488",We're actually pretty good together.
1071,"01:02:30,497","01:02:31,713","I don't know, bro."
1072,"01:02:32,290","01:02:34,904","Ok, I mess up one more time, I'm toast."
1073,"01:02:35,877","01:02:39,211","Totally freaks me out even thinking
about going back to the transportation shed."
1074,"01:02:41,841","01:02:43,469",I don't wanna die in Jumanji.
1075,"01:02:43,694","01:02:45,233",We just gotta stick together.
1076,"01:02:45,387","01:02:47,253","If we do that, we can win.
I know we can."
1077,"01:02:50,308","01:02:51,113","Oh, my God."
1078,"01:02:51,338","01:02:52,853",You're our missing piece.
1079,"01:02:53,078","01:02:54,822",You were the thing we needed to find.
1080,"01:02:55,105","01:02:57,188","So the clue was to, what..."
1081,"01:02:57,257","01:02:58,999","go to the bazaar
to find the missing piece?"
1082,"01:02:59,776","01:03:01,138",It wasn't the elephant.
1083,"01:03:03,571","01:03:05,208","It was me.
Yeah."
1084,"01:03:08,702","01:03:09,476",Dudes...
1085,"01:03:10,601","01:03:11,734","let's do this.
Yeah."
1086,"01:03:11,758","01:03:12,840",Yeah.
1087,"01:03:12,914","01:03:14,906","Let's do this.
Yeah, let's do this."
1088,"01:03:15,083","01:03:16,766","Hey, Spencer,
you gonna drink that margarita?"
1089,"01:03:17,335","01:03:20,103","I. You're done.
This is one good margarita."
1090,"01:03:28,972","01:03:31,260",There it is. The transportation shed.
1091,"01:03:31,933","01:03:33,625",There's all sorts of vehicles inside.
1092,"01:03:34,102","01:03:36,014","We gotta get one,
get across the canyon"
1093,"01:03:36,187","01:03:37,449",and get to the Jaguar statue.
1094,"01:03:39,107","01:03:40,894","Ok, I see the transportation shed."
1095,"01:03:41,067","01:03:43,730","I see the canyon,
but I still can't see the statue"
1096,"01:03:43,903","01:03:46,691","wich is weird, 'cause it's like the most
important thing in Jumanji and it's huge."
1097,"01:03:46,865","01:03:48,052",That's what she said.
1098,"01:03:50,327","01:03:51,619","You drunk, Fridge?"
1099,"01:03:52,495","01:03:54,452",What are you talking about? I ain't drunk.
1100,"01:03:54,622","01:03:57,330","He is drunk.
I had three little margaritas."
1101,"01:03:57,500","01:04:00,493","Well, you're about half your usual size.
Whatever, whatever."
1102,"01:04:00,670","01:04:03,287","Ok Alex what do we do here?
How do we get past this guards?"
1103,"01:04:03,465","01:04:05,848","Last time, I waited till they left.
How long did that take?"
1104,"01:04:06,217","01:04:08,500","Three weeks?
Oh, we gonna die."
1105,"01:04:08,970","01:04:10,411",Ok. Plan B.
1106,"01:04:10,889","01:04:12,440",Maybe there's another door somewhere.
1107,"01:04:12,564","01:04:14,428",But we gotta distract those guys first.
1108,"01:04:15,477","01:04:16,763",I've got it.
1109,"01:04:16,936","01:04:19,037","Distracting guys is, like,
the main thing I do."
1110,"01:04:19,138","01:04:20,900","He plays video games, I distract guys."
1111,"01:04:21,274","01:04:22,135","Bethany,"
1112,"01:04:22,260","01:04:25,240","I hate to break it to you right now
but you don't exactly have the..."
1113,"01:04:25,765","01:04:26,855",The tool kit.
1114,"01:04:27,530","01:04:28,696",Not me.
1115,"01:04:30,825","01:04:31,534",What?
1116,"01:04:32,159","01:04:33,884","You have to go down there
and flirt with those guys."
1117,"01:04:33,928","01:04:35,911","No.
Hold their attention while we sneak in."
1118,"01:04:35,935","01:04:40,450","No! I can't just go over there and flirt
with some weird soldiers I don't even know."
1119,"01:04:40,451","01:04:42,468","I know girl, but right now
we don't have a better idea."
1120,"01:04:42,545","01:04:44,763","You don't understand.
I actually can't do it."
1121,"01:04:47,425","01:04:48,857",I can't talk to guys.
1122,"01:04:49,177","01:04:50,659",I'm terrible at it.
1123,"01:04:51,179","01:04:52,841",I can give you some pointers.
1124,"01:04:54,182","01:04:55,266","No, I'm sorry..."
1125,"01:04:55,491","01:04:57,841","We. We have to come up
with another plan. I'm not. No."
1126,"01:04:58,686","01:04:59,718",Not doing that.
1127,"01:05:01,439","01:05:04,573","Martha you just have to distract them
long enough for us to get into the shed."
1128,"01:05:04,597","01:05:06,440","I really don't think I can Spencer,
I'm not..."
1129,"01:05:06,965","01:05:09,528","Like, I'm not actually
some badass girl."
1130,"01:05:10,865","01:05:13,249","What are you talking about?
You're a total badass."
1131,"01:05:16,746","01:05:18,078",You could do anything.
1132,"01:05:25,296","01:05:26,858","That's beautiful, Spencer."
1133,"01:05:27,132","01:05:29,670","Why don't I just go ahead and set
you guys with a nice candle light dinner."
1134,"01:05:30,043","01:05:31,626","Or do you guys wanna get
the hell out of here?"
1135,"01:05:32,595","01:05:33,652",All right.
1136,"01:05:34,222","01:05:35,654",Show me how it's done.
1137,"01:05:36,224","01:05:37,590",Class is in session.
1138,"01:05:38,268","01:05:39,311","Come on, girl.
Ok."
1139,"01:05:39,635","01:05:41,035",Watch and learn.
1140,"01:05:41,771","01:05:42,448",Hey.
1141,"01:05:42,873","01:05:44,703","What did you mean by that
candlelight-dinner thing?"
1142,"01:05:44,849","01:05:46,515","What are you talking about?
You said it, me and Martha"
1143,"01:05:46,693","01:05:48,480","candlelight dinner.
What does that even mean?"
1144,"01:05:49,154","01:05:50,948","The girl was into you, Spencer."
1145,"01:05:51,773","01:05:52,637",What?
1146,"01:06:02,083","01:06:04,706","Ok, in flirting situations the key,"
1147,"01:06:04,707","01:06:06,103",is making them check you out
1148,"01:06:06,104","01:06:08,591","without letting them know that you
know that they're checking you out."
1149,"01:06:08,665","01:06:11,023","Is just like whatever I'm doing me
and when they try to talk to you"
1150,"01:06:11,092","01:06:12,576",you can play it one of three ways.
1151,"01:06:12,600","01:06:15,811","Dumb, super into it or nasty."
1152,"01:06:16,055","01:06:18,272","Which way you play it depends on
what kind of guy you're dealing with."
1153,"01:06:18,549","01:06:20,816","This is like my dream
and my nightmare all at one time."
1154,"01:06:20,894","01:06:22,305",I won't take that personally.
1155,"01:06:22,479","01:06:24,687","Now, hair is everything."
1156,"01:06:24,856","01:06:27,769",Touch it. Move it. Play with it.
1157,"01:06:28,193","01:06:30,901","Move it around a lot.
Hypnotize them with it."
1158,"01:06:31,070","01:06:34,484","Give me a flip like that.
Ok, now angle your eyes down."
1159,"01:06:34,657","01:06:35,693","Now, head down."
1160,"01:06:35,867","01:06:37,324",Tilt up. Eyes big.
1161,"01:06:38,286","01:06:39,868","Now sparkle.
Sparkle?"
1162,"01:06:40,038","01:06:41,995",Like an anime character. Now sparkle.
1163,"01:06:48,713","01:06:49,749",Needs work.
1164,"01:06:57,347","01:06:58,604",Do you really think she likes me?
1165,"01:06:58,729","01:07:00,449",Why are we still talking about this?
1166,"01:07:00,450","01:07:02,162","I mean, what if she tries to kiss me?"
1167,"01:07:02,435","01:07:04,097","Then you just kiss her back, man."
1168,"01:07:04,979","01:07:08,423","What if she tries to kiss me, like.
Like. Like, without warning?"
1169,"01:07:09,651","01:07:12,077","What are you talking about?
Have you ever kissed anyone?"
1170,"01:07:12,078","01:07:13,870",Don't. Dude you gonna tell the whole jungle?
1171,"01:07:13,947","01:07:16,006","Hey guys. Guys, I found a side door.
Over here."
1172,"01:07:16,007","01:07:17,944","Guess what I found.
No, no, no, don't tell him."
1173,"01:07:18,117","01:07:20,755","Ok, let's talk about your walk.
Take your time."
1174,"01:07:21,329","01:07:24,197","Make a meal of it.
Like a gorgeous gazelle."
1175,"01:07:24,474","01:07:27,467","Or a horse. High-step it.
One foot in front of the other."
1176,"01:07:27,544","01:07:29,331",And bring it.
1177,"01:07:29,504","01:07:30,585",That's not it.
1178,"01:07:32,382","01:07:35,491","Anything you can do to draw attention
to the lips. A nibble like this."
1179,"01:07:36,135","01:07:38,878","A nibble goes a long way, girlfriend."
1180,"01:07:39,055","01:07:41,217",Good. That's better.
1181,"01:07:41,391","01:07:42,999","Now, smile. You look terrified."
1182,"01:07:43,324","01:07:44,679","Oh, my God, you're so funny."
1183,"01:07:44,727","01:07:46,684","You're so funny.
Oh, my God, you're so funny."
1184,"01:07:46,854","01:07:48,345","Oh, my God, you're so funny."
1185,"01:07:48,856","01:07:49,937",I think I'm getting it.
1186,"01:07:49,962","01:07:51,418","You are getting it. Go, girl."
1187,"01:07:51,568","01:07:54,034","Now, keep your lips
slightly parted, like... like..."
1188,"01:07:54,059","01:07:55,557","Yeah, not gross, just relaxed."
1189,"01:07:55,605","01:07:57,062","Now touch your tongue
to the roof of your mouth."
1190,"01:07:57,086","01:07:58,087",Like this.
1191,"01:07:58,533","01:07:59,533",Like this?
1192,"01:07:59,772","01:08:00,472",Like this.
1193,"01:08:00,480","01:08:01,716","Like this.
Like this."
1194,"01:08:05,415","01:08:06,451",Like this?
1195,"01:08:07,709","01:08:08,790",I think you're ready.
1196,"01:08:10,461","01:08:11,503","Cool.
Ok"
1197,"01:08:11,628","01:08:13,653",Flirt like our lives depend on it.
1198,"01:08:14,007","01:08:15,088",Because they do.
1199,"01:08:15,258","01:08:16,555","Ok, there's the door."
1200,"01:08:16,780","01:08:18,492","I just need something
to cut through the fence."
1201,"01:08:19,137","01:08:21,496","Ok, Fridge, you got anything like that
in the backpack?"
1202,"01:08:22,265","01:08:23,645","Yeah, I should."
1203,"01:08:23,770","01:08:24,597",What?
1204,"01:08:24,642","01:08:26,021",Here you go. I got some...
1205,"01:08:26,146","01:08:27,483",Some bolt cutters.
1206,"01:08:28,271","01:08:30,308","That seem like a good tool
for the situation?"
1207,"01:08:30,481","01:08:31,838","Perfect, actually."
1208,"01:08:32,609","01:08:34,191","It's called backpack power, baby."
1209,"01:08:35,862","01:08:36,924",You guys.
1210,"01:08:37,697","01:08:39,327",I think this is gonna work.
1211,"01:08:39,352","01:08:40,284",I think so too.
1212,"01:08:40,309","01:08:41,489",She's pretty fly.
1213,"01:08:41,618","01:08:43,659","And those guys don't meet
a lot of new people."
1214,"01:08:43,786","01:08:44,822",Fly?
1215,"01:08:44,996","01:08:47,798","Well, not like Cindy Crawford fly,
but for Jumanji,"
1216,"01:08:47,923","01:08:48,889",she the bomb.
1217,"01:08:49,375","01:08:50,411",The bomb?
1218,"01:08:50,585","01:08:51,331",Cindy Crawford?
1219,"01:08:51,356","01:08:52,350",That's your go-to?
1220,"01:08:52,703","01:08:54,992","I'm just saying, I'm sure
they'd like to get jiggy with her."
1221,"01:09:00,720","01:09:01,756",Alex.
1222,"01:09:02,930","01:09:04,292",What year do you think it is?
1223,"01:09:05,808","01:09:07,745","What do you mean?
Oh, no."
1224,"01:09:08,227","01:09:09,819",It's 1996.
1225,"01:09:13,399","01:09:15,340","You're Alex Vreeke, aren't you?"
1226,"01:09:15,860","01:09:16,915","Yeah, that's right."
1227,"01:09:17,340","01:09:19,048","Wait a minute, you mean Freak House?"
1228,"01:09:19,197","01:09:20,008",Wait what are you...
1229,"01:09:20,033","01:09:21,301",what are you guys talking about?
1230,"01:09:21,626","01:09:22,688",How do you know me?
1231,"01:09:24,285","01:09:25,389",Alex...
1232,"01:09:25,414","01:09:28,724","Alex, I don't exactly know how to tell you..
You've been in this game for 20 years."
1233,"01:09:29,073","01:09:30,830",That's probably not how I would've done it.
1234,"01:09:31,668","01:09:32,584",What?
1235,"01:09:32,609","01:09:35,456","No. You guys are messing
with me, right?"
1236,"01:09:35,505","01:09:39,270","No, we're not. Alex Vreeke.
Everybody in Brantford knows about you."
1237,"01:09:39,842","01:09:41,505",You're the kid that disappeared.
1238,"01:09:42,679","01:09:44,136",Twenty years ago.
1239,"01:09:44,889","01:09:46,050",Twenty years?
1240,"01:09:46,933","01:09:48,570","Twenty years, man."
1241,"01:09:49,769","01:09:51,581","I don't even know how to say this, but"
1242,"01:09:51,605","01:09:54,021","Cindy Crawford, dude,
she's like 50 years old."
1243,"01:09:54,399","01:09:56,162",But still fly.
1244,"01:09:57,860","01:09:58,951",Wait.
1245,"01:10:04,659","01:10:05,695",There she is.
1246,"01:10:13,793","01:10:14,793",Hey.
1247,"01:10:16,879","01:10:18,116",We're gonna get you home.
1248,"01:10:19,674","01:10:20,685",Yeah.
1249,"01:10:42,113","01:10:43,979",What's the hell is going on with her butt?
1250,"01:10:44,157","01:10:45,864","Bethany, what did you tell her to do?"
1251,"01:10:46,284","01:10:47,991",Did she twist her ankle maybe or...
1252,"01:10:48,061","01:10:49,898","She's never flirted before.
Give her a break."
1253,"01:10:54,876","01:10:56,142","Hello, little lady."
1254,"01:10:57,670","01:10:59,312",What are you doing out here all alone?
1255,"01:11:01,883","01:11:03,090","Hey, you guys."
1256,"01:11:03,259","01:11:04,972",I seem to be lost.
1257,"01:11:05,845","01:11:07,837",Can you guys help me?
1258,"01:11:10,683","01:11:11,840","Hello, little lady."
1259,"01:11:13,311","01:11:15,098",What are you doing out here all alone?
1260,"01:11:19,525","01:11:21,130","You guys are so
interesting and funny."
1261,"01:11:21,255","01:11:22,341",What's she doing?
1262,"01:11:22,612","01:11:24,124","What, she got a bug in her hair?"
1263,"01:11:24,697","01:11:26,659",She's forgotten all of our training.
1264,"01:11:27,033","01:11:28,074",Let's go.
1265,"01:11:32,747","01:11:35,865",Wait! I. I. I have to tell you
1266,"01:11:35,889","01:11:37,825",about this book that I've been reading.
1267,"01:11:38,294","01:11:40,051",About microbiology.
1268,"01:11:40,421","01:11:44,256",Which is one of my favorite biologies.
1269,"01:11:50,681","01:11:51,917","Hello, little lady."
1270,"01:11:52,391","01:11:55,150",What are you doing out here all alone?
1271,"01:12:00,525","01:12:02,693",You are a badass.
1272,"01:12:13,371","01:12:14,371",Hey.
1273,"01:12:14,914","01:12:16,325",You guys like to dance?
1274,"01:12:25,758","01:12:28,341","Oh, yeah, there we go."
1275,"01:12:44,110","01:12:45,817","Which one, which one, which one?"
1276,"01:12:47,989","01:12:49,296",I hate this place.
1277,"01:12:54,537","01:12:56,579",Her strength is dance fighting.
1278,"01:12:56,956","01:12:58,989","Alex, what do you think?
What's the move?"
1279,"01:12:59,458","01:13:00,744","What?
What do we take?"
1280,"01:13:01,018","01:13:01,946","Which one?
I don't..."
1281,"01:13:01,971","01:13:03,094","I don't know, man, Ok?"
1282,"01:13:03,095","01:13:04,582","I told you, I...
We gotta fly, right?"
1283,"01:13:04,755","01:13:06,942","The helicopter? We gotta fly.
I told you, I don't know."
1284,"01:13:18,352","01:13:19,868",She's kicking their ass.
1285,"01:13:20,146","01:13:21,353",That's our girl.
1286,"01:13:21,731","01:13:23,472","Yes, queen!"
1287,"01:13:31,407","01:13:33,239",She is destroying them.
1288,"01:14:09,946","01:14:12,233","You go, girl!
Yeah."
1289,"01:14:14,158","01:14:16,150","Go, go!"
1290,"01:14:16,827","01:14:18,146",Yes! Yes!
1291,"01:14:19,371","01:14:20,815",You're my hero.
1292,"01:14:22,583","01:14:23,824",We gotta go.
1293,"01:14:23,848","01:14:25,938","You should give me lessons in kicking ass.
Give me a hug girlfriend."
1294,"01:14:26,212","01:14:27,248","Oh, my God.
You did it."
1295,"01:14:27,421","01:14:29,333","I did.
Yeah, give me a hug, girlfriend."
1296,"01:14:29,507","01:14:32,124","As great of a moment that is,
we ain't got the time for it man."
1297,"01:14:32,301","01:14:33,417","Yeah.
They coming."
1298,"01:14:33,594","01:14:35,301","The motorcycles freaks
are coming, we gotta go."
1299,"01:14:35,471","01:14:37,303","Seaplane! We got to fly, man."
1300,"01:14:37,473","01:14:39,731",Nope. I can't do it.
1301,"01:14:40,101","01:14:42,268","Ok? I told you, I'm not a good pilot."
1302,"01:14:43,693","01:14:45,095",Maybe we should take the school bus.
1303,"01:14:45,247","01:14:47,739","What? We can't outrun them
monster in that little damn bus."
1304,"01:14:47,817","01:14:50,560","You picked the plane and hot-air balloon.
Maybe pick the helicopter."
1305,"01:14:50,736","01:14:52,089","No, I can't do it. Ok?"
1306,"01:14:52,114","01:14:53,268",I don't wanna die.
1307,"01:14:53,990","01:14:55,448",I'm freaking out a little bit.
1308,"01:14:56,617","01:14:59,101",Fine. I'll do it.
1309,"01:14:59,870","01:15:01,773","How hard can it be?
It's a helicopter. You..."
1310,"01:15:01,898","01:15:03,158","You press a button, the..."
1311,"01:15:03,708","01:15:04,744",They gonna spin.
1312,"01:15:05,218","01:15:06,785","Ok. Then after that, I got my, the..."
1313,"01:15:07,209","01:15:08,644",The lever. That's how you...
1314,"01:15:08,869","01:15:10,793","That's how you getting
the forward-backward action."
1315,"01:15:11,018","01:15:12,785","Once we in the air,
I'll be all right."
1316,"01:15:12,786","01:15:13,943",I just...
1317,"01:15:13,968","01:15:15,196","This, I just gotta get..."
1318,"01:15:15,521","01:15:17,135","Because it ain't got no step stool, so."
1319,"01:15:17,388","01:15:19,505","Let me see something, you know what,
I think that I'm just gonna.."
1320,"01:15:19,682","01:15:22,174","Get in, but be careful.
No, you're drunk."
1321,"01:15:22,198","01:15:23,676","No way.
Fridge, you're drunk."
1322,"01:15:24,001","01:15:25,188",Give me the keys.
1323,"01:15:25,938","01:15:27,675","I'm?
Alex. Alex."
1324,"01:15:28,149","01:15:31,558","If I can fight those guys,
you can fly this helicopter. I know you can."
1325,"01:15:32,111","01:15:33,152",Come on.
1326,"01:15:35,906","01:15:36,947",Alex.
1327,"01:15:38,409","01:15:39,871",This is where we need you.
1328,"01:15:40,745","01:15:43,238","Remember, you're the missing piece."
1329,"01:15:46,792","01:15:49,639","Seaplane McDonough
reporting for duty."
1330,"01:15:50,064","01:15:51,461","Let's go, people."
1331,"01:16:23,454","01:16:25,286","What's wrong?
Something's broken!"
1332,"01:16:25,456","01:16:27,994","What do you mean?
Hang on!"
1333,"01:16:35,257","01:16:37,214","Oh, my God, we're about to die!"
1334,"01:16:37,384","01:16:38,670",We're about to die!
1335,"01:16:46,685","01:16:49,177","Oh, my God!
It won't go up!"
1336,"01:16:49,355","01:16:50,516","What?
What do you mean?"
1337,"01:16:50,689","01:16:51,725",The collective is busted.
1338,"01:16:51,899","01:16:53,756","What?
It controls the plate up there,"
1339,"01:16:54,026","01:16:55,588","which tilts the rotors
and controls the pitch."
1340,"01:16:56,362","01:16:57,503",It's how we go up and down.
1341,"01:17:05,329","01:17:06,386",You guys?
1342,"01:17:07,373","01:17:09,560","That can't be good.
No way that's good news."
1343,"01:17:17,675","01:17:19,132",Albino rhinos!
1344,"01:17:23,264","01:17:24,727",They're indigenous to Jumanji.
1345,"01:17:25,052","01:17:28,003","They're huge, white, scary, and
stupid and they eat people."
1346,"01:17:28,028","01:17:28,411",No.
1347,"01:17:31,772","01:17:32,808",They're getting close!
1348,"01:17:32,982","01:17:35,019",My stomach's starting to bother me a little bit..
1349,"01:17:35,192","01:17:36,699","Go up!
I can't go up!"
1350,"01:17:37,528","01:17:39,144",I think I had too many margaritas.
1351,"01:17:43,909","01:17:45,525","You guys, what are we gonna do?"
1352,"01:17:46,120","01:17:47,536",I'll fix the helicopter.
1353,"01:17:47,663","01:17:48,904","Yes!
Tell me what to do."
1354,"01:17:49,081","01:17:52,700","You gotta connect the flight-control rod
to the mesh plate under the rotors."
1355,"01:17:52,877","01:17:55,414","Flight-control rod, mesh plate,
under the rotors."
1356,"01:17:55,487","01:17:56,623","Wait, what?
I'll be right back."
1357,"01:17:57,423","01:18:00,507","Spencer, where are you going?
Hurry up."
1358,"01:18:01,385","01:18:03,047","Be careful!
No, no, just hurry up!"
1359,"01:18:03,220","01:18:05,303","All right, just gonna stand on this thingy"
1360,"01:18:05,472","01:18:09,032","pull myself up towards these
deadly helicopter blades. Ok."
1361,"01:18:11,729","01:18:13,286",There's the mesh plate.
1362,"01:18:13,856","01:18:15,222",Here's that rod thingy.
1363,"01:18:25,534","01:18:27,651","Spencer!
Speed it up, Alex!"
1364,"01:18:37,504","01:18:38,595",Spencer!
1365,"01:18:41,967","01:18:44,180","Hurry! Come on, fix it!"
1366,"01:18:51,477","01:18:53,013","Oh, my God!
Running out of time, Spencer!"
1367,"01:18:53,187","01:18:54,928","Fix it, please!
No, no, no."
1368,"01:18:55,898","01:18:57,514",Got it!
1369,"01:19:05,366","01:19:07,858","We made it! You did it!
I thought we were gonna die."
1370,"01:19:08,452","01:19:09,693","Yes!
Nice!"
1371,"01:19:09,717","01:19:10,269",Thank you.
1372,"01:19:11,170","01:19:12,504",That was scary.
1373,"01:19:12,528","01:19:13,628","Thank you, guys."
1374,"01:19:15,084","01:19:16,084",What?
1375,"01:19:17,795","01:19:18,986",I dropped the jewel.
1376,"01:19:19,463","01:19:20,504","What?
What?"
1377,"01:19:20,505","01:19:21,865",You dropped the jewel?
1378,"01:19:22,266","01:19:23,392","I leaned over,"
1379,"01:19:23,542","01:19:25,018",thought I had to puke and I didn't.
1380,"01:19:25,023","01:19:26,234",And it came out of my backpack.
1381,"01:19:26,303","01:19:28,072",We need the freaking jewel!
1382,"01:19:28,197","01:19:28,819",I know.
1383,"01:19:28,973","01:19:31,407","That's. That's. That's the crazy
part because I know we need it."
1384,"01:19:31,508","01:19:33,616",So we're in a pickle. We're in a pickle.
1385,"01:19:33,686","01:19:35,143","Alex, turn around.
We gotta go back and get it."
1386,"01:19:35,312","01:19:36,434","Yeah, let's loop around."
1387,"01:19:36,459","01:19:38,429","Just look for it. Everybody
open your eyes."
1388,"01:19:38,482","01:19:39,998",Let's all look for it as a group.
1389,"01:19:47,908","01:19:48,944",There! I see it!
1390,"01:19:57,418","01:19:58,534",What are they doing?
1391,"01:19:58,711","01:20:00,873",It's like they're protecting it or something.
1392,"01:20:01,755","01:20:03,087",How we gonna do this?
1393,"01:20:03,257","01:20:03,974",I don't know.
1394,"01:20:04,399","01:20:06,249","Well, you gotta go get it, right, buddy?"
1395,"01:20:10,055","01:20:11,562",What do you need? Your boomerang?
1396,"01:20:11,932","01:20:13,673",Maybe. Maybe some scissors?
1397,"01:20:13,851","01:20:16,118",A pipe wrench? Some shoelaces?
1398,"01:20:16,395","01:20:18,808","I'm your valet. Whatever you need,
I can get it for you."
1399,"01:20:18,981","01:20:20,543",Ok? You just say the word.
1400,"01:20:21,692","01:20:23,074","What?
I'm sorry, buddy."
1401,"01:20:23,144","01:20:24,144",Sorry for what?
1402,"01:20:34,830","01:20:35,846",No.
1403,"01:20:49,261","01:20:50,468",Turn us around.
1404,"01:20:51,013","01:20:52,049",No!
1405,"01:20:54,725","01:20:57,433",Heel! Heel! Stop!
1406,"01:20:57,603","01:20:59,469","Oh, my God!"
1407,"01:20:59,646","01:21:01,558","No!
Alex, get ready to roll us"
1408,"01:21:01,732","01:21:03,268","to the side.
What?"
1409,"01:21:04,818","01:21:07,026","When I tell you,
roll 90 degrees to the right."
1410,"01:21:09,239","01:21:10,525",Now!
1411,"01:21:14,536","01:21:16,979","You pushed me out the helicopter,
jackass!"
1412,"01:21:22,753","01:21:24,762","You know what Spencer,
you were amazing."
1413,"01:21:24,763","01:21:26,646","You are a killer pilot, Alex."
1414,"01:21:26,715","01:21:27,131",Thanks.
1415,"01:21:27,156","01:21:29,736","And you too Spencer
you were incredible!"
1416,"01:21:30,161","01:21:31,251","Thank you body.
Hey!"
1417,"01:21:31,276","01:21:32,224","He was amazing,
No, no, no."
1418,"01:21:32,249","01:21:33,143","Excuse me!
our pilot."
1419,"01:21:33,263","01:21:34,352","You were incredible.
You killed it."
1420,"01:21:34,376","01:21:35,376","No, no, no.
Excuse me!"
1421,"01:21:35,400","01:21:36,824",Excuse me!
1422,"01:21:36,825","01:21:38,587",I'm the one that was a human sacrifice.
1423,"01:21:39,311","01:21:42,320","You don't know what's on
the underside of those rhinos."
1424,"01:21:42,689","01:21:44,251",And you don't wanna know.
1425,"01:21:44,942","01:21:46,549",I've seen a lot of things.
1426,"01:21:46,819","01:21:48,456",Felt them on my face too.
1427,"01:21:49,029","01:21:51,596","Things that I will never be able
to erase from my memory."
1428,"01:21:53,534","01:21:54,984","Oh, that's funny to you guys.
Go ahead."
1429,"01:21:55,209","01:21:56,551",Laugh it up. Get it out.
1430,"01:21:59,623","01:22:03,162","Guys, I've been trying to get across
this canyon for like 20 years, Ok?"
1431,"01:22:03,335","01:22:04,977",Do you realize how huge this is?
1432,"01:22:09,883","01:22:11,590",Mosquito.
1433,"01:22:12,302","01:22:14,866","No, no, no! Alex, no, no, no, no, no!
Alex."
1434,"01:22:15,639","01:22:16,921","Alex, Alex, no."
1435,"01:22:17,391","01:22:19,438","Alex, talk to me. Wake up.
Here we go."
1436,"01:22:20,063","01:22:21,284",Alex? He's dying.
1437,"01:22:21,437","01:22:23,294","No, we can't let him die.
We're too close!"
1438,"01:22:23,564","01:22:25,099",Does anyone know how to do CPR?
1439,"01:22:25,424","01:22:28,064","Yes. Start with three chest
compressions and mouth-to-mouth."
1440,"01:22:28,589","01:22:29,967","One, two, three."
1441,"01:22:30,612","01:22:32,604","How do I do this?
Ok, pinch his nose"
1442,"01:22:32,781","01:22:34,488","open his mouth, full lip-lock.
Ok."
1443,"01:22:34,992","01:22:37,335","One breath, two breaths, then repeat."
1444,"01:22:46,545","01:22:48,377","Come on, Alex."
1445,"01:22:51,091","01:22:52,749","Bethany, stop. Your tattoo."
1446,"01:22:54,928","01:22:56,791","It looks like you're giving him
one of your lives."
1447,"01:22:59,475","01:23:00,741",I'm Ok with that.
1448,"01:23:01,018","01:23:02,522",What if you need it for yourself?
1449,"01:23:02,947","01:23:04,426",I want Alex to come home too.
1450,"01:23:28,003","01:23:29,365","What happened?
Alex."
1451,"01:23:29,838","01:23:31,480",Bethany gave you one of her lives.
1452,"01:23:32,333","01:23:33,457","Bethany, you ok?"
1453,"01:23:33,482","01:23:34,394",I think so.
1454,"01:23:34,843","01:23:36,129","Bethany, is that true?"
1455,"01:23:36,303","01:23:37,860",You gave me one of your lives?
1456,"01:23:38,430","01:23:39,796","I mean, yeah, of course."
1457,"01:23:40,933","01:23:41,974",Thank you.
1458,"01:23:52,069","01:23:53,259",What? What are you looking at?
1459,"01:23:53,584","01:23:54,676",You got a situation.
1460,"01:23:58,033","01:24:00,350","Oh, my God, these things are crazy."
1461,"01:24:15,759","01:24:16,816",Twenty years?
1462,"01:24:18,804","01:24:20,196","Yeah, I guess so."
1463,"01:24:24,685","01:24:25,696",You know...
1464,"01:24:26,270","01:24:28,278","I just keep thinking about
my poor parents."
1465,"01:24:29,147","01:24:30,734",What they've must have been through.
1466,"01:24:31,108","01:24:34,025","And why because,
I was sitting in my hideout"
1467,"01:24:34,102","01:24:35,584",too afraid to finish the game?
1468,"01:24:39,658","01:24:40,840",I'm sorry.
1469,"01:24:41,410","01:24:43,378","I don't mean to lay this on you.
I'm just..."
1470,"01:24:44,454","01:24:46,097",You're really easy to talk to.
1471,"01:24:46,122","01:24:47,156","No, I get it."
1472,"01:24:47,381","01:24:48,813","I mean, sometimes..."
1473,"01:24:49,334","01:24:52,122","it's easy to get so focused
on your own stuff that..."
1474,"01:24:52,838","01:24:55,155","you forget other people
have problems too."
1475,"01:24:57,050","01:24:58,166",That's really deep.
1476,"01:24:58,885","01:25:01,252","Thanks. I feel like
ever since I lost my phone"
1477,"01:25:01,630","01:25:03,587","my other senses have
kind of heightened."
1478,"01:25:05,392","01:25:07,576","Does phone mean something different
in the future?"
1479,"01:25:13,108","01:25:14,974","What about you, Alex?
What are you like?"
1480,"01:25:15,152","01:25:16,890",In the real world. What's your vibe?
1481,"01:25:19,156","01:25:20,522",Full on metalhead.
1482,"01:25:21,116","01:25:22,924","A drummer, like my dad."
1483,"01:25:38,383","01:25:39,383",Hey.
1484,"01:25:41,845","01:25:43,337","Hey.
What are you doing?"
1485,"01:25:43,361","01:25:44,240",I...
1486,"01:25:44,665","01:25:45,800",just filling these up.
1487,"01:25:45,849","01:25:46,941","Cool.
Yeah."
1488,"01:25:52,147","01:25:53,383",I'm glad you're here. I...
1489,"01:25:55,776","01:25:57,239",I have something to tell you.
1490,"01:25:57,464","01:25:58,117",Yeah?
1491,"01:25:58,570","01:25:59,761",And I wanna tell you now...
1492,"01:26:00,238","01:26:01,944","just in case the next time that, that..."
1493,"01:26:01,968","01:26:03,147",that we talk...
1494,"01:26:04,172","01:26:05,476",I'm no longer brave.
1495,"01:26:08,038","01:26:09,424",I like you Martha.
1496,"01:26:10,591","01:26:11,785",I like...
1497,"01:26:12,610","01:26:13,628",like you.
1498,"01:26:14,753","01:26:17,570","Like, I'm fully into you."
1499,"01:26:18,006","01:26:19,363","You are?
I am."
1500,"01:26:20,342","01:26:21,471","And I have been,"
1501,"01:26:22,196","01:26:24,225","since like, the seventh grade."
1502,"01:26:25,847","01:26:26,929",Really?
1503,"01:26:29,267","01:26:31,204","I don't think
this has ever happened before."
1504,"01:26:32,145","01:26:32,965",What do you mean?
1505,"01:26:32,990","01:26:35,950","Oh what I mean is... like I don't think
anyone's ever liked me that I... I..."
1506,"01:26:36,675","01:26:38,230",I can't believe I'm doing this.
1507,"01:26:38,254","01:26:39,793",I never tell anyone how I...
1508,"01:26:42,906","01:26:44,373","I'm into you too, Spencer."
1509,"01:26:46,702","01:26:48,410","You are?
Yes. Yes!"
1510,"01:26:49,079","01:26:52,368","God, you're smart and sweet and cute."
1511,"01:26:52,999","01:26:54,906","Yeah, I'm pretty into you."
1512,"01:26:57,379","01:26:58,349",Wait.
1513,"01:26:58,774","01:27:00,859",Are you sure it's not because of...
1514,"01:27:01,284","01:27:02,694","like, all of..."
1515,"01:27:02,843","01:27:04,550","What? Oh, my God, no, no."
1516,"01:27:04,920","01:27:06,145",That is not my type.
1517,"01:27:06,370","01:27:07,528",I'm into nerds.
1518,"01:27:07,597","01:27:08,659",Really?
1519,"01:27:09,850","01:27:10,991",I'm a nerd.
1520,"01:27:31,288","01:27:32,778","That was... I was so awful.
Never. I've never."
1521,"01:27:32,803","01:27:34,606","I've never kissed anyone.
You've never?"
1522,"01:27:34,631","01:27:36,056",Never. That was the first time.
1523,"01:27:36,080","01:27:37,269","I have never.
Oh, you haven't?"
1524,"01:27:37,293","01:27:38,646","No.
Ok. Cool."
1525,"01:27:39,171","01:27:40,278","You can't tell, right?"
1526,"01:27:44,176","01:27:45,942",Come on. Hey!
1527,"01:27:46,219","01:27:47,531",I don't wanna see that.
1528,"01:27:47,856","01:27:49,227","I don't, not today."
1529,"01:27:49,473","01:27:52,738","When you are done here professing your love
for one another, I've found the jaguar."
1530,"01:27:53,810","01:27:54,832",Let's go.
1531,"01:27:55,157","01:27:56,168",God!
1532,"01:28:07,365","01:28:08,499",There it is.
1533,"01:28:08,924","01:28:10,047",There it is.
1534,"01:28:10,577","01:28:11,863",We'd better get walking.
1535,"01:28:33,975","01:28:36,009",I think we just follow this path.
1536,"01:28:38,146","01:28:40,388",No. It can't be that easy.
1537,"01:28:41,608","01:28:43,395",The Defenders.
1538,"01:28:45,695","01:28:46,861",What does that mean?
1539,"01:28:48,323","01:28:49,905",There's only one way to find out.
1540,"01:28:52,244","01:28:53,280",Fridge.
1541,"01:28:54,162","01:28:55,369",Give me the jewel.
1542,"01:28:58,917","01:29:00,108",Spencer.
1543,"01:29:16,142","01:29:17,781",Something's about to happen.
1544,"01:29:18,006","01:29:19,334",I hate those drums.
1545,"01:29:20,272","01:29:21,914","What, you're just gonna walk in there?"
1546,"01:29:22,941","01:29:23,941",No.
1547,"01:29:24,734","01:29:26,590",That's what the game wants us to do.
1548,"01:29:26,915","01:29:28,042",Follow the path.
1549,"01:29:29,698","01:29:30,839",It's a trap.
1550,"01:29:37,330","01:29:39,162","When you see the elephant,"
1551,"01:29:40,292","01:29:42,175",begin the climb.
1552,"01:29:48,091","01:29:49,423",I'll go through the trees.
1553,"01:29:49,593","01:29:50,879","The trees?
Yeah."
1554,"01:29:51,052","01:29:53,069","Do you think that's what that means?
That must be it."
1555,"01:29:53,638","01:29:54,725",That's the move.
1556,"01:29:55,599","01:29:57,582",This is the final level of the game.
1557,"01:29:58,351","01:30:00,694","And I'm pretty sure
this is a Bravestone thing."
1558,"01:30:06,276","01:30:08,694","Did he just refer to himself
in the third person?"
1559,"01:30:09,905","01:30:11,771","Fourth person, I think."
1560,"01:30:18,538","01:30:19,745",How does he do that?
1561,"01:30:20,624","01:30:22,491",Climbing is one of his strengths.
1562,"01:30:23,460","01:30:24,476",Gotcha.
1563,"01:30:25,253","01:30:26,995",Cake makes me explode.
1564,"01:30:48,818","01:30:52,277","No! Spencer!
Oh, my God!"
1565,"01:30:52,447","01:30:53,538",Spencer!
1566,"01:30:54,616","01:30:56,108",Spencer!
1567,"01:31:01,957","01:31:03,542","Oh, my God, you guys. Panthers."
1568,"01:31:04,167","01:31:04,894",No.
1569,"01:31:09,339","01:31:10,947",Those are jaguars.
1570,"01:31:32,404","01:31:33,465",Spencer!
1571,"01:31:34,322","01:31:35,872","Oh, my God. Are you Ok?"
1572,"01:31:36,397","01:31:38,090",Yeah. I think so.
1573,"01:31:38,243","01:31:39,500","You still have the jewel, right?"
1574,"01:31:41,121","01:31:42,453","I got it.
Oh, thank God."
1575,"01:31:42,622","01:31:44,739","Hey, what happened?
I don't wanna talk about it."
1576,"01:31:46,334","01:31:47,825","Ok, so we need a new plan."
1577,"01:31:48,003","01:31:49,039","Yeah.
Right."
1578,"01:31:49,212","01:31:51,020","Totally.
Spencer, any ideas?"
1579,"01:31:53,633","01:31:55,766",Can I speak with you for a minute?
1580,"01:31:57,220","01:31:58,286",Now?
1581,"01:32:00,849","01:32:01,915",What's going on?
1582,"01:32:03,768","01:32:05,034",I can't do this.
1583,"01:32:05,311","01:32:06,384",What are you talking about?
1584,"01:32:06,408","01:32:08,624",I can't do this.
1585,"01:32:08,773","01:32:11,607","Ok, who am I kidding?
I'm not some adventurer."
1586,"01:32:11,776","01:32:14,259",I'm not actually brave.
1587,"01:32:14,283","01:32:16,737","Spencer, I just saw you
hanging out of a helicopter."
1588,"01:32:16,906","01:32:19,599","It's a lot easier to be brave
when you have lives to spare."
1589,"01:32:20,076","01:32:21,283",It's a lot harder...
1590,"01:32:22,579","01:32:24,162",when you only have one life.
1591,"01:32:25,957","01:32:28,525","We. We always only have one life, man."
1592,"01:32:30,003","01:32:30,919",Ok? That's...
1593,"01:32:30,944","01:32:33,691","That's all we get.
That's how it works."
1594,"01:32:34,883","01:32:36,750","The question is,
is how are you gonna live it?"
1595,"01:32:37,427","01:32:39,919",Which guy are you gonna decide to be?
1596,"01:32:42,432","01:32:44,264",Did I just quote our principal?
1597,"01:32:44,434","01:32:46,721","What the hell is this game doing to me?
I gotta get out of here."
1598,"01:32:47,312","01:32:48,319",Look.
1599,"01:32:48,688","01:32:50,150","We can do this, man."
1600,"01:32:51,983","01:32:53,394",We can do it together.
1601,"01:32:57,030","01:32:58,030",Together.
1602,"01:32:58,346","01:32:59,422",Together.
1603,"01:33:02,118","01:33:03,684","You're a good friend, Fridge."
1604,"01:33:07,665","01:33:08,722",All right.
1605,"01:33:10,210","01:33:12,477",Ok. I don't know video games.
1606,"01:33:12,754","01:33:15,041",But what I do know is football.
1607,"01:33:15,215","01:33:17,598","Now, those lightning-fast,
man-eating cats out there?"
1608,"01:33:17,967","01:33:19,208",They're the Defenders.
1609,"01:33:19,385","01:33:21,547","Which means that we gotta run
one hell of an offense."
1610,"01:33:21,721","01:33:22,757",You guys.
1611,"01:33:25,809","01:33:27,173","We gotta go.
All right."
1612,"01:33:27,898","01:33:29,117",Here's what we're gonna do.
1613,"01:33:32,148","01:33:34,310","We're gonna fan out
and run a play that I call:"
1614,"01:33:34,484","01:33:36,426",The Double Reverse Refrigerator.
1615,"01:33:36,903","01:33:39,216","Bethany, you go up the left side."
1616,"01:33:39,656","01:33:40,963",I'll go up the right.
1617,"01:33:41,533","01:33:44,501","Alex, you'll draw the defense,
so Spencer can go up the middle."
1618,"01:33:44,577","01:33:45,916","I'll go with Spencer.
No."
1619,"01:33:46,141","01:33:47,879","There's something else
we need you to do."
1620,"01:34:00,051","01:34:01,258",You guys like to dance?
1621,"01:34:18,403","01:34:20,486",Hey! Over here!
1622,"01:34:20,655","01:34:21,847",Come and get me!
1623,"01:35:00,361","01:35:01,647","Thanks.
Sure."
1624,"01:35:04,782","01:35:06,323",Get to the statue. Go!
1625,"01:35:26,763","01:35:28,049","Oh, no! I..."
1626,"01:36:38,376","01:36:40,618","Oh, man. Ok."
1627,"01:36:40,795","01:36:42,407","Stay calm, don't panic."
1628,"01:36:42,880","01:36:44,371",Stop!
1629,"01:36:49,178","01:36:50,919",It's the elephant and the mouse.
1630,"01:36:52,473","01:36:53,530",What's up?
1631,"01:36:54,100","01:36:55,187",Mouse Finbar.
1632,"01:36:56,060","01:36:57,352",Zoologist.
1633,"01:36:58,229","01:36:59,837",Zoologist and...
1634,"01:37:00,606","01:37:02,123",and backpack guy.
1635,"01:37:22,170","01:37:25,334",Give me the jewel or your friend dies.
1636,"01:37:27,216","01:37:28,723","Don't give it to him!
Quiet!"
1637,"01:37:29,344","01:37:30,351",Stop!
1638,"01:37:35,683","01:37:37,496","Take me instead, Ok?"
1639,"01:37:47,236","01:37:48,522",Give me the jewel.
1640,"01:37:49,697","01:37:51,029",I can't do that.
1641,"01:37:51,366","01:37:52,607",Five
1642,"01:37:53,201","01:37:55,394","Four.
I can't give you the jewel."
1643,"01:37:55,418","01:37:56,070",Three.
1644,"01:37:56,371","01:37:57,578","Spencer.
Two!"
1645,"01:37:57,747","01:37:58,879",Because I don't have it!
1646,"01:38:07,507","01:38:09,298","Zoology, bitch!"
1647,"01:38:20,853","01:38:22,185","No, no, no! Don't..."
1648,"01:38:29,570","01:38:30,665",Douche bag!
1649,"01:38:30,990","01:38:32,257",You suck!
1650,"01:38:36,202","01:38:36,908",Elephant.
1651,"01:38:37,233","01:38:38,643",Begin the climb.
1652,"01:38:41,541","01:38:42,682",Leave her alone!
1653,"01:38:43,626","01:38:45,208","Get up there
and I'll get the jewel to you."
1654,"01:38:45,378","01:38:46,489","Martha.
Trust me."
1655,"01:38:46,963","01:38:48,304","I'll get it to you. Go.
Ok."
1656,"01:38:55,680","01:38:56,867","Go, Martha!"
1657,"01:39:05,148","01:39:06,184",Alex!
1658,"01:40:06,584","01:40:07,646",I'll take that.
1659,"01:40:20,765","01:40:22,176",Game over.
1660,"01:40:33,069","01:40:34,426",I don't think so.
1661,"01:40:39,659","01:40:41,100",Venom's my weakness.
1662,"01:41:10,815","01:41:12,131","Go, Spencer."
1663,"01:41:22,243","01:41:23,275",No.
1664,"01:41:35,047","01:41:36,128","Yeah!
Yeah."
1665,"01:41:49,562","01:41:50,898",Call out its name.
1666,"01:41:51,272","01:41:53,855","Call out its name!
Call out its name, everyone!"
1667,"01:41:54,025","01:41:59,737","Jumanji!
Jumanji!"
1668,"01:42:40,154","01:42:41,846","I think we did it.
I think we won."
1669,"01:42:41,870","01:42:43,109",I think we did.
1670,"01:42:44,075","01:42:45,541","Guys, it's Nigel."
1671,"01:42:46,118","01:42:47,175",Nigel.
1672,"01:42:56,045","01:42:57,982","Well done, intrepid adventurers."
1673,"01:42:58,255","01:42:59,621",You lifted the curse!
1674,"01:42:59,799","01:43:01,665",All of Jumanji thanks you.
1675,"01:43:01,842","01:43:03,299",Your work here is done.
1676,"01:43:03,469","01:43:05,557","So sadly, this is where we part."
1677,"01:43:06,430","01:43:07,846",Seaplane McDonough
1678,"01:43:08,224","01:43:09,940",let me shake your hand.
1679,"01:43:17,066","01:43:18,098",Alex.
1680,"01:43:23,239","01:43:25,027","Adieu, Professor Oberon."
1681,"01:43:31,330","01:43:32,492","Later, dude."
1682,"01:43:39,672","01:43:43,165","I'll miss you the most, my little Mouse.
Get me the hell out of here."
1683,"01:43:50,933","01:43:52,525","Farewell, Ruby Roundhouse."
1684,"01:43:54,145","01:43:55,202",Wait.
1685,"01:43:55,771","01:43:57,007",What if we didn't go back?
1686,"01:43:59,275","01:44:00,366",I just...
1687,"01:44:01,986","01:44:05,020",I like being like this. With you.
1688,"01:44:06,741","01:44:09,134",Then let's be like this...
1689,"01:44:09,910","01:44:11,372",every day.
1690,"01:44:13,330","01:44:14,542",Just come home.
1691,"01:44:32,725","01:44:34,191",Dr. Bravestone.
1692,"01:44:46,363","01:44:49,352","Nigel, I'm ready to go home."
1693,"01:44:50,785","01:44:52,347","Farewell, my good man."
1694,"01:44:57,750","01:44:59,187","See you later, Bravestone."
1695,"01:45:30,449","01:45:34,659","Oh, my God.
Yes, yes, yes! I'm back, baby!"
1696,"01:45:34,829","01:45:37,697","I will never complain about my body
ever again. Oh, thank God."
1697,"01:45:38,374","01:45:39,710","Oh, I missed you."
1698,"01:45:46,006","01:45:47,247",Where's Alex?
1699,"01:46:09,697","01:46:11,438","Wait, look."
1700,"01:46:15,327","01:46:16,534",Freak House?
1701,"01:46:21,000","01:46:22,036",Do you think?
1702,"01:46:22,209","01:46:24,502","That means, maybe."
1703,"01:46:35,055","01:46:36,887","Grandpa!
Hey!"
1704,"01:46:38,684","01:46:42,052","Come here. Come here.
Oh, that's my girl."
1705,"01:46:42,229","01:46:43,970","Hi!
Oh, it's so good to see you."
1706,"01:46:45,441","01:46:48,024","Come on.
Come on and say hi to Grandma."
1707,"01:46:48,193","01:46:50,150","Alex?
Hey, Dad, when you get a sec"
1708,"01:46:50,321","01:46:52,608","could you give us a hand?
Yeah."
1709,"01:46:52,781","01:46:55,114","Oh, that is some tree."
1710,"01:46:55,284","01:46:58,072","Yeah, it's not too bad.
