reporting live from the site
of a massive battle"
2,"00:00:16,650","00:00:19,952","between the justice league
and a group of what can
only be described"
3,"00:00:19,954","00:00:23,655","as super-villains
calling themselves
the legion of doom."
4,"00:00:23,657","00:00:26,925","Reports state that earlier,
the legion launched
a surprise attack"
5,"00:00:26,927","00:00:29,828","on the league at the unveiling
of their new headquarters,"
6,"00:00:29,830","00:00:33,699","dubbed by many
on social media as
""the hall of justice."""
7,"00:01:02,430","00:01:05,397","Is this any way to treat
your guests, superman?"
8,"00:01:05,399","00:01:08,600","Seeing as how you
crashed the party,
I'd consider us even."
9,"00:01:09,270","00:01:10,569",Oh!
10,"00:01:38,899","00:01:40,466","What happened,
toymaster?"
11,"00:01:40,468","00:01:42,101","Did mama kick you
out of the basement?"
12,"00:01:42,103","00:01:43,202",Hmph.
13,"00:01:55,483","00:01:57,249",Grundy smash!
14,"00:02:18,305","00:02:22,074",Grundy sleep now.
15,"00:02:24,578","00:02:26,945","Robin, report.
How's crowd control?"
16,"00:02:28,415","00:02:30,182",Huh?
17,"00:02:35,489","00:02:39,725","Well at hand, father.
As predicted, they respond
like contemptible sheep."
18,"00:02:41,795","00:02:43,695","Surrender, cheetah."
19,"00:02:43,697","00:02:45,998","This doesn't have
to end in violence."
20,"00:02:59,413","00:03:00,746",Aah!
21,"00:03:12,860","00:03:14,860","You're smarter
than this, Luthor."
22,"00:03:17,831","00:03:20,432",Your kind attracts their kind.
23,"00:03:20,434","00:03:24,169","I'm simply
an innocent industrialist
caught in the middle."
24,"00:03:24,171","00:03:25,571",I'll bet.
25,"00:03:34,848","00:03:36,515",You'll pay for this.
26,"00:03:36,517","00:03:38,250","Knowing you, it's insured."
27,"00:03:52,433","00:03:53,799",Huh?
28,"00:03:55,536","00:03:57,102","Beep, beep."
29,"00:03:57,438","00:03:58,637",Huh?
30,"00:04:07,147","00:04:08,347",Not in the face.
31,"00:04:09,350","00:04:10,682",Whatever you say.
32,"00:04:19,560","00:04:21,260","Playtime's over, toymaster."
33,"00:04:21,262","00:04:23,929","But I enjoy
a good game."
34,"00:04:24,832","00:04:27,065",And I always win.
35,"00:04:50,257","00:04:51,757","Good work, team."
36,"00:04:51,759","00:04:54,026","Too bad shazam and lantern
had to miss the fun."
37,"00:04:54,028","00:04:55,994",Yeah. Slackers.
38,"00:05:02,436","00:05:03,735",We got a runner.
39,"00:05:07,308","00:05:08,407",Aah!
40,"00:05:14,315","00:05:16,682","Come on, wizard,
don't make me hit you again."
41,"00:05:19,053","00:05:20,886","Uh, wiz?"
42,"00:05:20,888","00:05:23,388","Azarath calls,"
43,"00:05:23,390","00:05:26,758",the child must answer.
44,"00:05:26,760","00:05:30,228","The hour of his rising
is at hand."
45,"00:05:30,230","00:05:31,363","Oh, boy."
46,"00:05:32,466","00:05:33,732",I've got this.
47,"00:05:46,780","00:05:49,414","Hmm. What the hell
did he hit me with?"
48,"00:05:50,651","00:05:52,117","Himself, apparently."
49,"00:05:57,491","00:05:59,358",He's not using any tech.
50,"00:05:59,360","00:06:00,826",It's magic.
51,"00:06:07,501","00:06:09,701",Argh!
52,"00:06:15,175","00:06:16,675",Get them to safety.
53,"00:06:16,677","00:06:18,210",I'll keep him distracted.
54,"00:06:28,789","00:06:30,322",Argh!
55,"00:06:32,259","00:06:33,792",Argh!
56,"00:06:39,266","00:06:42,401","Robin, get all civilians
inside, do you read me?"
57,"00:06:42,403","00:06:45,103","I have a more efficient way
to keep them safe, father."
58,"00:06:45,105","00:06:48,573","Robin?
 Robin, I gave you a task."
59,"00:06:48,575","00:06:52,878","Yes, as a human cattle prod.
I'm being under-utilized."
60,"00:06:55,015","00:06:56,548",What's your location?
61,"00:06:56,550","00:06:58,417",Where I need to be.
62,"00:06:58,419","00:07:00,085",In the driver's seat.
63,"00:07:00,087","00:07:02,587","Between the missile
and fuel cell detonations,"
64,"00:07:02,589","00:07:05,090","I'd estimate at least
a three kiloton hit."
65,"00:07:07,461","00:07:09,428",Target locked.
66,"00:07:09,430","00:07:10,962","Damian, stand down."
67,"00:07:12,399","00:07:13,498",Too late now.
68,"00:07:40,160","00:07:41,426",Stand down!
69,"00:07:44,364","00:07:47,265","The lasso compels you
to obey my command!"
70,"00:07:56,844","00:07:57,943",What happened?
71,"00:07:57,945","00:07:59,277",He doesn't know.
72,"00:08:01,315","00:08:03,248","I thought that would knock
the fight out of him."
73,"00:08:06,620","00:08:08,987","What? We got him, didn't we?"
74,"00:08:08,989","00:08:11,590","What we have is an empty shell
with no answers."
75,"00:08:11,592","00:08:14,993","If you had followed orders
and done what you're told,
we'd know more."
76,"00:08:14,995","00:08:16,595","Come on,
cut him some slack."
77,"00:08:16,597","00:08:18,029","At least, he was trying to..."
78,"00:08:20,634","00:08:22,501",Not that I disagree.
79,"00:08:22,503","00:08:25,904","You buried me
in a worthless position
to keep me out of the way."
80,"00:08:25,906","00:08:28,106","And I solved
the entire problem."
81,"00:08:28,108","00:08:29,608",This isn't about you.
82,"00:08:29,610","00:08:31,076",It's about teamwork.
83,"00:08:31,078","00:08:34,379","All I see is a lot
of ineffectual grandstanding."
84,"00:08:34,381","00:08:36,648","Which is why I prefer
to work alone."
85,"00:08:36,650","00:08:39,584","And my dad
thinks I'm difficult."
86,"00:08:40,721","00:08:43,088","Have you ever considered
boarding school?"
87,"00:09:09,650","00:09:11,016",I could've driven myself.
88,"00:09:11,018","00:09:12,817",After the stunt you pulled?
89,"00:09:12,819","00:09:15,620","You're lucky to be allowed
within 10 feet
of a steering wheel."
90,"00:09:19,493","00:09:21,192","So, this is my punishment?"
91,"00:09:21,194","00:09:23,428","Enduring a bunch
of school children?"
92,"00:09:23,430","00:09:25,330",This is not punishment.
93,"00:09:25,332","00:09:27,599","Hopefully, you'll learn
to be a part of a team."
94,"00:09:27,601","00:09:30,802","And they're not children.
They're teenagers."
95,"00:09:30,804","00:09:32,404",Worse.
96,"00:09:32,406","00:09:35,073","Don't tell me
Damian Wayne is afraid
of a little socializing."
97,"00:09:35,842","00:09:37,876",I'm not afraid of anything.
98,"00:09:37,878","00:09:39,344",Teammates are a liability.
99,"00:09:39,680","00:09:40,812",Really?
100,"00:09:40,814","00:09:42,347",Then what am I to you?
101,"00:09:43,216","00:09:45,550",An unavoidable irritation.
102,"00:10:29,529","00:10:31,496","You were having
a nightmare last night."
103,"00:10:31,498","00:10:33,498","I was just wondering
if everything's..."
104,"00:10:33,500","00:10:36,901","Look, I appreciate
your concern, I guess.
But they're dreams."
105,"00:10:36,903","00:10:38,403",Just dreams.
106,"00:10:45,112","00:10:46,711","You know you're naked, right?"
107,"00:10:46,713","00:10:48,046",Huh?
108,"00:10:48,448","00:10:50,148",Aah!
109,"00:10:50,150","00:10:52,317",I overslept. Was rushing.
110,"00:10:52,319","00:10:56,554","Forgot to put on my uniform.
Okay? So I sleep in the nude.
So what?"
111,"00:10:57,124","00:10:59,157",Animals are naked.
112,"00:10:59,159","00:11:03,294","I'm the entire animal kingdom
crammed into a single
magnificent specimen."
113,"00:11:03,296","00:11:05,196","You're something crammed
into something."
114,"00:11:07,434","00:11:09,300",What did that thing just say?
115,"00:11:09,302","00:11:11,069",It was just laughing at you.
116,"00:11:11,071","00:11:12,804","Yeah, well, butt out, bug."
117,"00:11:14,074","00:11:16,641","Yow! Keep that thing
on a leash, man!"
118,"00:11:16,643","00:11:18,443","I told you, don't annoy it."
119,"00:11:20,981","00:11:22,213",Jaime's right.
120,"00:11:22,215","00:11:24,382",That scarab is not a pet.
121,"00:11:24,384","00:11:26,384","It may be fused
to Jaime's spine,"
122,"00:11:26,386","00:11:29,821","but it's not exactly
under his control."
123,"00:11:29,823","00:11:31,189",It's like you and your pants.
124,"00:11:32,626","00:11:34,325",That's why Jaime's here.
125,"00:11:34,327","00:11:36,227",That's why we're all here.
126,"00:11:36,229","00:11:38,630","To help each other
control our gifts."
127,"00:11:38,632","00:11:40,965","Help one another
become our best selves."
128,"00:11:40,967","00:11:44,769","Where else are we gonna go?
I mean, we're a bunch
of freaks, right?"
129,"00:11:44,771","00:11:48,640","Come on, Jaime,
we're all family.
Like the three amigos."
130,"00:11:48,642","00:11:49,841",Four.
131,"00:11:49,843","00:11:51,109",Five.
132,"00:11:53,213","00:11:54,579",We're getting a visitor.
133,"00:12:00,120","00:12:01,619",Try not to behead anyone.
134,"00:12:07,294","00:12:09,227","-Nightwing.
-Starfire."
135,"00:12:10,864","00:12:12,230",It's been awhile.
136,"00:12:12,866","00:12:14,132",I know.
137,"00:12:14,134","00:12:15,467",You're looking good.
138,"00:12:16,036","00:12:17,869",This is Damian.
139,"00:12:17,871","00:12:19,571",The new Robin.
140,"00:12:19,573","00:12:20,772","Welcome, Damian."
141,"00:12:25,312","00:12:26,745",I'll be in my room.
142,"00:12:26,747","00:12:29,080","-Would you like to...
-I think I can manage."
143,"00:12:30,083","00:12:32,751",That is one creepy  mocoso.
144,"00:12:32,753","00:12:35,687","No, more like sad."
145,"00:12:40,594","00:12:44,963","Yeah, I was thinking a movie
might be nice.
Just you and me."
146,"00:12:44,965","00:12:46,631",No men in tights.
147,"00:12:46,633","00:12:47,799",That sounds nice.
148,"00:12:47,801","00:12:50,268","By the way, I bought
some new glasses."
149,"00:12:50,270","00:12:52,670",You might not recognize me.
150,"00:12:52,672","00:12:54,405","I'm sure I'll be able
to pick you out"
151,"00:12:54,407","00:12:56,040",no matter what you're wearing.
152,"00:12:56,042","00:12:57,575",See you soon.
153,"00:13:10,957","00:13:12,323",Hello?
154,"00:13:29,142","00:13:32,477","If this is a prank,
you're screwing
with the wrong guy."
155,"00:14:02,609","00:14:03,675",Hah!
156,"00:14:07,013","00:14:09,848","He hasn't stopped
for an hour and a half."
157,"00:14:11,318","00:14:14,485","Damian, it's time
to let others have their turn."
158,"00:14:15,956","00:14:18,523",I'm not finished.
159,"00:14:18,525","00:14:19,624",Hah!
160,"00:14:23,763","00:14:25,864","Gee, how'd that happen?"
161,"00:14:30,270","00:14:31,369",What the hell?
162,"00:14:31,371","00:14:34,105","Hmph, I heard your tech
was fast."
163,"00:14:34,107","00:14:36,140",I wanted to see how fast.
164,"00:14:36,142","00:14:38,243","Don't mess with us,
little man."
165,"00:14:38,745","00:14:40,311",All right.
166,"00:14:40,313","00:14:43,581","I can see we are getting off
on the wrong foot."
167,"00:14:44,351","00:14:46,784","Damian, this is a team effort."
168,"00:14:46,786","00:14:49,287","We need to be willing
to accommodate others."
169,"00:14:49,289","00:14:51,556","Nightwing said
you were a Princess."
170,"00:14:52,692","00:14:54,025","Exiled, no doubt."
171,"00:14:54,027","00:14:56,628","Technically, it was a coup."
172,"00:14:56,630","00:14:59,831","And like it or not,
i am the leader
of this group."
173,"00:14:59,833","00:15:03,167","As I see it, you're an alien
with nowhere else to go."
174,"00:15:03,169","00:15:05,103","Everyone needs a home, Damian."
175,"00:15:05,105","00:15:06,404",You included.
176,"00:15:06,406","00:15:08,840","Thank you for chiming in,
witch girl."
177,"00:15:08,842","00:15:12,277","We are only here
to help you realize
your potential."
178,"00:15:12,279","00:15:13,778",You've been here long enough.
179,"00:15:13,780","00:15:15,980","When do you think
you'll realize yours?"
180,"00:15:18,218","00:15:21,219","Dude, you need
to show some respect."
181,"00:15:21,221","00:15:23,488",- Argh!
182,"00:15:25,759","00:15:26,958","Oh, no."
183,"00:15:31,831","00:15:33,364",Ready when you are.
184,"00:15:35,735","00:15:37,535","No, stop this."
185,"00:15:39,873","00:15:41,239",Hah!
186,"00:15:44,911","00:15:47,879","Who's fighting me,
you or the bug?"
187,"00:15:47,881","00:15:49,280",You'd better hope it's me.
188,"00:16:05,932","00:16:07,999","That's the difference
between you and me."
189,"00:16:08,001","00:16:09,634",You wear a weapon.
190,"00:16:10,203","00:16:11,769",I am a weapon.
191,"00:16:13,640","00:16:15,340",No!
192,"00:16:16,209","00:16:17,675",Aah!
193,"00:16:22,816","00:16:24,015",Enough!
194,"00:16:25,885","00:16:27,652",I tried to stop it.
195,"00:16:31,358","00:16:33,458",Dios mio. Is he dead?
196,"00:16:35,428","00:16:37,996",He's still alive. Barely.
197,"00:16:37,998","00:16:41,199","This is going to be
an awkward call to Batman."
198,"00:16:41,201","00:16:42,533",Everyone get back.
199,"00:16:44,637","00:16:48,539","By the powers of azarath,
i beseech you."
200,"00:16:48,541","00:16:51,609","Azarath, metrion, zinthos."
201,"00:17:02,989","00:17:05,156","We need to get her
back to her room."
202,"00:17:05,158","00:17:06,524",Garfield?
203,"00:17:07,627","00:17:08,893",I've got her.
204,"00:17:13,133","00:17:14,832",What... what happened?
205,"00:17:14,834","00:17:17,568","Raven healed you.
We have to tend to her."
206,"00:17:18,938","00:17:20,371",Sorry.
207,"00:17:27,080","00:17:29,414","I knew you'd be here
working all night."
208,"00:17:29,416","00:17:30,948",Thought you might be hungry.
209,"00:17:32,452","00:17:33,885","No, thanks."
210,"00:17:33,887","00:17:35,119",Suit yourself.
211,"00:17:38,224","00:17:40,958","Where does all that food go
if you don't have a stomach?"
212,"00:17:41,961","00:17:43,428",You don't wanna know.
213,"00:17:43,430","00:17:45,296",What are you up to?
214,"00:17:45,298","00:17:47,298","I've been combing
through footage from
every camera on the grid."
215,"00:17:47,300","00:17:48,366",And?
216,"00:17:48,368","00:17:50,068",There's something odd.
217,"00:17:50,070","00:17:52,837","Dark spots.
They're hard to make out."
218,"00:17:55,742","00:17:57,708","Activate quadrant
pixel enhancement."
219,"00:18:03,950","00:18:05,083",Show-off.
220,"00:18:08,655","00:18:09,821",What is that? A shadow?
221,"00:18:09,823","00:18:12,223","No, the sun direction
is wrong."
222,"00:18:12,225","00:18:15,026","And look here,
it's disconnected
from the surface."
223,"00:18:15,929","00:18:17,962",It's mimicking a shadow.
224,"00:18:17,964","00:18:19,363",It has intelligence.
225,"00:18:19,365","00:18:21,766","It's wandering,
like it's looking
for something."
226,"00:18:22,402","00:18:24,469",Or someone.
227,"00:18:24,471","00:18:26,971","There's where weather wizard
ran into it."
228,"00:18:26,973","00:18:28,539",More like stepped in it.
229,"00:18:28,541","00:18:30,041","You don't think
it was after him."
230,"00:18:30,543","00:18:31,843",No.
231,"00:18:31,845","00:18:32,977",I don't.
232,"00:18:38,585","00:18:42,186","Don't get me wrong,
i love catching up
on popular culture"
233,"00:18:42,188","00:18:45,456","but the harsh language
was entirely unnecessary,"
234,"00:18:45,458","00:18:49,327","and the female lead seemed
to only be present in order
to be rescued"
235,"00:18:49,329","00:18:50,962",by the leading man.
236,"00:18:50,964","00:18:53,030","But all in all,
i found myself
reasonably diverted."
237,"00:18:55,835","00:18:57,001",Clark?
238,"00:18:58,905","00:19:01,839",Trigon lives.
239,"00:19:04,944","00:19:07,512",--Are you all right?
240,"00:19:07,514","00:19:09,113","Sorry, it's just..."
241,"00:19:10,383","00:19:12,150","I've got a lot on my mind
right now."
242,"00:19:12,152","00:19:14,619","You can always share
your burdens with me, Clark."
243,"00:19:18,091","00:19:20,224","Ugh, stay away from me."
244,"00:19:36,876","00:19:38,676",Hey!
245,"00:19:38,678","00:19:40,511",What is wrong with you?
246,"00:19:40,513","00:19:42,780","That is
very dangerous."
247,"00:19:42,782","00:19:45,082","You could put out an eye
with that thing."
248,"00:19:45,084","00:19:48,085","Didn't your mother tell you
never to play with knives?"
249,"00:19:48,087","00:19:50,087","By the powers
of azarath,"
250,"00:19:50,089","00:19:51,722",I beseech you.
251,"00:19:51,724","00:19:53,624","Mother spirit
of the nether realm,"
252,"00:19:53,626","00:19:55,593","protect my
brothers and sister."
253,"00:19:55,595","00:19:58,763","And give me strength
to face the dark force
i fear is coming."
254,"00:20:11,010","00:20:13,611","I suppose I should thank you
for healing me."
255,"00:20:15,815","00:20:18,482","Um, you're welcome."
256,"00:20:18,484","00:20:20,718","It was strange
having you in my head."
257,"00:20:20,720","00:20:23,287","I felt you prying
into my entire life."
258,"00:20:23,289","00:20:25,256",It was not appreciated.
259,"00:20:25,258","00:20:28,526","I'm an empath, and if it
makes you feel any better,"
260,"00:20:28,528","00:20:30,328","I didn't see it
as much as felt it."
261,"00:20:30,330","00:20:32,496","And I've been trying
to shake it off ever since."
262,"00:20:32,498","00:20:35,933","Then you know
I'm not meant to be here
at this stupid school."
263,"00:20:35,935","00:20:38,169","I was groomed
for a higher calling."
264,"00:20:38,171","00:20:39,203",My grandfather's...
265,"00:20:39,205","00:20:40,771","I know all about
your grandfather."
266,"00:20:40,773","00:20:43,541",I felt him. He was a demon.
267,"00:20:43,543","00:20:46,611","And believe me,
i know my demons."
268,"00:20:47,447","00:20:48,946",He was a great man.
269,"00:20:48,948","00:20:52,083","We were going to make
the world stronger, better."
270,"00:20:52,085","00:20:54,685","We were going
to rule it together."
271,"00:20:54,687","00:20:56,754","I know all about
that game, too."
272,"00:20:56,756","00:21:00,791","Now, I don't mean to be rude,
but would you mind getting
the hell away from me?"
273,"00:21:04,430","00:21:08,866","You know, when you were
in my head, I could see things
about you, too."
274,"00:21:08,868","00:21:11,769","-Like what?
-It looked like a man."
275,"00:21:11,771","00:21:14,238",But something more.
276,"00:21:14,240","00:21:16,707",Who... what was that thing?
277,"00:21:16,709","00:21:19,610","It was nothing, a nightmare."
278,"00:21:19,612","00:21:22,913","It was real, I could tell."
279,"00:21:22,915","00:21:26,017","It's none of your business.
Who are you to judge my life?"
280,"00:21:26,019","00:21:27,885","You have other things
to fix here."
281,"00:21:27,887","00:21:29,787","Just stay away from me, okay?"
282,"00:21:35,628","00:21:37,595",Steady...
283,"00:21:39,632","00:21:42,033",Ah. Argh!
284,"00:21:42,035","00:21:45,536","Can you please do that
anywhere else?"
285,"00:21:45,538","00:21:46,837",Jaime?
286,"00:21:48,374","00:21:50,875",Yeah?
287,"00:21:50,877","00:21:53,477","Perhaps it was a mistake
to challenge you this morning
without knowing"
288,"00:21:53,479","00:21:58,182","the full capacity
of your alien attachment."
289,"00:21:58,184","00:22:00,985","I promise you,
it won't happen again."
290,"00:22:05,692","00:22:07,725",Did he just say he's sorry?
291,"00:22:08,394","00:22:11,062","Aw, see. He likes you."
292,"00:22:33,419","00:22:36,253",Trigon lives.
293,"00:22:56,843","00:22:58,943",Atomic skull.
294,"00:22:58,945","00:23:00,911","We had quite a tumble
last year."
295,"00:23:00,913","00:23:05,449","Still, I sensed you,
being a good guy and all,
playing nice."
296,"00:23:06,719","00:23:08,586",You won't have to this time.
297,"00:23:08,588","00:23:11,021","I've gotten
a lot, lot, stronger."
298,"00:23:14,794","00:23:16,293",You don't look so good.
299,"00:23:31,177","00:23:33,144","Okay, okay."
300,"00:23:53,132","00:23:56,367","He's barely alive, Clark,
what's wrong with you?"
301,"00:23:59,772","00:24:01,372",He's not himself.
302,"00:24:01,374","00:24:02,773",What is that?
303,"00:24:02,775","00:24:04,074",Kryptonite.
304,"00:24:05,144","00:24:07,111","Guess he doesn't
tell you everything."
305,"00:24:08,881","00:24:12,483",The rising is coming.
306,"00:24:12,485","00:24:15,152",You cannot stop it.
307,"00:24:17,323","00:24:19,790","Superman, someone
is controlling you."
308,"00:24:20,626","00:24:24,128",You have your part to play.
309,"00:24:24,130","00:24:25,663",Both of you.
310,"00:24:25,665","00:24:29,433",The girl will be taken.
311,"00:24:30,803","00:24:32,102",Girl?
312,"00:24:35,775","00:24:37,174","Diana, wait!"
313,"00:24:37,176","00:24:39,477","-We cannot let him...
-I've alerted Trevor."
314,"00:24:39,479","00:24:42,379","With any luck,
military satellites
are tracking him now."
315,"00:24:42,381","00:24:43,948",And what will we do?
316,"00:24:43,950","00:24:45,850",Wait for him to...
317,"00:24:45,852","00:24:47,818","Pull the moon
from the sky?"
318,"00:24:47,820","00:24:50,354","No, we'll get..."
319,"00:24:50,356","00:24:53,457","He hasn't said anything
about doing something
like that, has he?"
320,"00:24:53,860","00:24:55,793","No, but..."
321,"00:24:55,795","00:24:59,196","We're both targets
and for all we know,
so is the rest of the league."
322,"00:25:00,933","00:25:02,800","Get back to that island
of yours"
323,"00:25:02,802","00:25:05,436","and lock yourself
in the darkest, deepest tomb
you can find."
324,"00:25:05,438","00:25:06,804",I'll call.
325,"00:25:06,806","00:25:09,106",But Clark and I are...
326,"00:25:09,108","00:25:11,976",You can't expect me to hide.
327,"00:25:11,978","00:25:13,844",Was worth a shot.
328,"00:25:30,263","00:25:32,630",What are you doing in my room?
329,"00:25:32,632","00:25:34,565","We have rules, Damian."
330,"00:25:36,269","00:25:38,702","You never trespass
another person's space."
331,"00:25:38,704","00:25:41,705","You have nothing on her.
No background, no history."
332,"00:25:41,707","00:25:42,873",On who?
333,"00:25:42,875","00:25:44,074",Raven.
334,"00:25:44,076","00:25:45,743","You're the leader
of this group."
335,"00:25:45,745","00:25:47,144","You should know everything
about her."
336,"00:25:47,146","00:25:48,679","It's called ""vetting."""
337,"00:25:48,681","00:25:50,014",She's 14.
338,"00:25:50,016","00:25:51,849","No mother, no father."
339,"00:25:51,851","00:25:55,185","She grew up
in a hostile realm,
not unlike my own planet."
340,"00:25:55,187","00:25:57,755","And she escaped, like I did."
341,"00:25:57,757","00:26:00,691","We didn't know anything
about raven
when we took her in"
342,"00:26:00,693","00:26:02,726",except that she needed a home.
343,"00:26:02,728","00:26:04,962",A place to grow.
344,"00:26:04,964","00:26:09,533","I was taught that knowledge
was power and you knew
nothing about her."
345,"00:26:09,535","00:26:12,603","How much do you have to know
when people are in need?"
346,"00:26:12,605","00:26:16,840","Garfield was 11
when his genetics kicked in
and gave him green skin"
347,"00:26:16,842","00:26:18,542",and powers.
348,"00:26:18,544","00:26:20,644","We still don't know
the purpose of Jaime's
alien armor"
349,"00:26:20,646","00:26:22,713",or all of its abilities.
350,"00:26:22,715","00:26:24,915",We just knew they needed help.
351,"00:26:24,917","00:26:27,484","You have to have
a little faith sometimes."
352,"00:26:27,486","00:26:30,588","Faith is belief
based on an absence of data."
353,"00:26:30,590","00:26:32,289",It invites disaster.
354,"00:26:37,630","00:26:40,764","You have no idea
how frustrating it is."
355,"00:26:40,766","00:26:43,267",He reminds me of my sister.
356,"00:26:43,269","00:26:46,036","I told you he was tough.
 Never had a childhood."
357,"00:26:46,038","00:26:49,640","Doesn't know how to act
 with kids or anyone else
 for that matter."
358,"00:26:49,642","00:26:51,575",It's affecting everybody.
359,"00:26:51,577","00:26:54,578","Well, you can't expect him
 to be great at bonding."
360,"00:26:54,580","00:26:57,548","Spent most of his life
 training to kill."
361,"00:26:57,550","00:26:59,750","Then moves in
 with the big bad bat,"
362,"00:26:59,752","00:27:02,419","which I can tell you
 from personal experience,
 is not exactly fun."
363,"00:27:03,889","00:27:06,190",So you've told me.
364,"00:27:11,864","00:27:13,564","Speaking of fun,"
365,"00:27:13,566","00:27:15,165",the old room looks great.
366,"00:27:15,167","00:27:16,834","You know, kori,
 you and I could just..."
367,"00:27:16,836","00:27:19,269","- Fun.
 -What?"
368,"00:27:19,271","00:27:21,672","That's it,
that's what we need."
369,"00:27:21,674","00:27:23,173",What who needs?
370,"00:27:23,175","00:27:25,242","Oh, you're so smart.
Thanks, dick."
371,"00:27:25,244","00:27:27,378","But kori, I don't..."
372,"00:27:28,848","00:27:30,180",Fun.
373,"00:27:36,489","00:27:38,522","I wondered
when you'd get back."
374,"00:27:38,524","00:27:39,790",They lost superman.
375,"00:27:39,792","00:27:41,525","Fifty-five miles
off the coast."
376,"00:27:41,527","00:27:44,161","Flash is checking the area,
he just disappeared."
377,"00:27:45,798","00:27:47,398",Where the hell is he going?
378,"00:27:47,400","00:27:49,600","You have my feed
from the Batmobile?"
379,"00:27:53,973","00:27:55,305",Yeah.
380,"00:27:55,875","00:27:57,408",That's messed up.
381,"00:27:57,410","00:28:00,077","The entity was strong enough
to possess a Kryptonian."
382,"00:28:00,079","00:28:02,680","It can't stay in the host
if the host is damaged."
383,"00:28:02,682","00:28:07,217","If I'd poisoned superman
with a bigger dose,
i might have saved him."
384,"00:28:07,219","00:28:11,221","Scour the net,
narrow your search results
to superman sightings"
385,"00:28:11,223","00:28:13,257","and to recent
supernatural events."
386,"00:28:13,993","00:28:15,592",Supernatural?
387,"00:28:16,062","00:28:18,562",Yes. Subsection:
388,"00:28:18,564","00:28:19,630",Female.
389,"00:29:07,046","00:29:09,646","Aah! Dude, did you have
to bring the sword?"
390,"00:29:09,648","00:29:12,216","Preparedness is a prerequisite
for victory."
391,"00:29:12,218","00:29:14,351","The gear stays
in the car, Damian."
392,"00:29:14,353","00:29:18,222","Tonight we are to enjoy
some mandatory fun."
393,"00:29:29,769","00:29:34,238","This is an opportunity for us
to become more familiar
with each other."
394,"00:29:34,240","00:29:36,240","How much more
familiar can we get?"
395,"00:29:36,242","00:29:38,709","We've already seen
Garfield lick himself."
396,"00:29:38,711","00:29:40,744","-As a dog?
-I wish."
397,"00:30:11,811","00:30:14,611","Just call me ""eagle eyes."""
398,"00:30:44,143","00:30:45,409",What?
399,"00:30:48,013","00:30:49,646",Huh?
400,"00:31:44,670","00:31:46,236","Here, have some."
401,"00:31:49,141","00:31:51,108",That tastes like pure sugar.
402,"00:31:51,110","00:31:53,777","Boy, were you
up in those mountains
a long time."
403,"00:31:56,248","00:31:58,282","It was a joke,
I'm not criticizing."
404,"00:31:58,284","00:32:00,284",I knew it was a joke.
405,"00:32:00,286","00:32:03,220","And if you knew me,
you wouldn't waste
your time trying."
406,"00:32:04,490","00:32:07,824","I guess neither of
our lives are very funny."
407,"00:32:07,826","00:32:10,627","But I'll tell you something
about yourself that
not even you know."
408,"00:32:11,330","00:32:13,230","You may be insufferable,"
409,"00:32:13,232","00:32:16,500","but in your heart,
you are a kind
and generous soul."
410,"00:32:49,735","00:32:50,801",Booyah!
411,"00:32:53,072","00:32:56,006","Oh, looks like we found
something the bug can't do."
412,"00:32:57,176","00:32:59,443","Please, please, no autographs."
413,"00:32:59,445","00:33:01,478",I'm a busy man.
414,"00:33:05,384","00:33:08,251","Free popcorn to anyone
who can slay the beast."
415,"00:33:08,253","00:33:10,220",I can do it.
416,"00:33:10,222","00:33:11,922",You know how to dance?
417,"00:33:11,924","00:33:13,457",I'm a quick study.
418,"00:33:19,031","00:33:21,565","Hmm, all right."
419,"00:33:26,939","00:33:28,605",Hope you're a good loser.
420,"00:33:39,351","00:33:41,451",Dance!
421,"00:34:41,346","00:34:43,046",Mira. Look at them go.
422,"00:34:46,285","00:34:47,984",Raven...
423,"00:34:51,090","00:34:52,889",They're waiting for you.
424,"00:35:04,136","00:35:06,903","On the hill,
 beyond the tent."
425,"00:35:31,029","00:35:32,829",Sister...
426,"00:35:37,970","00:35:40,103",He wants you.
427,"00:35:41,206","00:35:44,374","We've missed you, sister."
428,"00:35:45,344","00:35:47,477","It can't be him, it's a trick."
429,"00:35:47,479","00:35:49,479","It is me, child."
430,"00:35:52,151","00:35:53,517",How?
431,"00:35:53,519","00:35:56,786","Never leave unfinished
 what you start."
432,"00:35:56,788","00:35:59,022","-You fled.
-I left."
433,"00:35:59,024","00:36:00,090",I had you.
434,"00:36:01,226","00:36:03,860","Yet, here I am."
435,"00:36:05,430","00:36:08,165","If you were really here,
I'd smell your stink."
436,"00:36:08,167","00:36:09,833",You're still trapped.
437,"00:36:09,835","00:36:11,968","All you can send
are these losers."
438,"00:36:11,970","00:36:14,554",I will be there.
439,"00:36:14,555","00:36:17,139","It's our destiny
 to be together,
 raven, always."
440,"00:36:17,976","00:36:19,543",We're family.
441,"00:36:19,545","00:36:21,711",You can make that happen.
442,"00:36:21,713","00:36:24,114",You can bring me.
443,"00:36:24,116","00:36:25,916",I will fight you every step.
444,"00:36:25,918","00:36:29,886","-You're an abomination.
 -Watch your talk,
 ungrateful girl."
445,"00:36:37,095","00:36:38,762",Look at yourself.
446,"00:36:38,764","00:36:41,064","-Weak, lonely."
447,"00:36:41,066","00:36:42,432",Aligning with chattel.
448,"00:36:42,434","00:36:46,770","It is beneath my contempt
 and I will not have it."
449,"00:36:46,772","00:36:48,638","You will be a part of
 this, child."
450,"00:36:48,640","00:36:52,509","You will know
 the glory of trigon."
451,"00:36:52,511","00:36:53,877",Argh!
452,"00:36:55,414","00:36:57,948","Mother of azarath,
give me strength."
453,"00:37:16,034","00:37:18,702","You cannot last.
You're temporal agents."
454,"00:37:18,704","00:37:20,904",We will last long enough.
455,"00:37:23,875","00:37:24,941",Aah!
456,"00:37:26,478","00:37:27,744",He wants you.
457,"00:37:27,746","00:37:30,146",He will have you.
458,"00:38:06,752","00:38:08,718","Awesome, dude."
459,"00:38:08,720","00:38:10,920","Yes, quite impressive."
460,"00:38:12,024","00:38:14,424","You were
very good too, Garfield."
461,"00:38:14,426","00:38:16,693","Yeah, okay."
462,"00:38:18,030","00:38:18,995",Whatever.
463,"00:38:24,202","00:38:25,502",Ugh!
464,"00:38:27,172","00:38:29,773","Raven! Titans, go!"
465,"00:39:16,355","00:39:19,222","They're demonic emissaries.
My father sent them."
466,"00:39:19,224","00:39:20,290",Your father?
467,"00:39:24,963","00:39:26,363",Damn it.
468,"00:39:26,365","00:39:27,630",Argh!
469,"00:40:13,445","00:40:16,212",Please tell me they're undead.
470,"00:40:16,214","00:40:18,815","Yes, but you can't stop them
like that."
471,"00:40:18,817","00:40:20,083",They're like batteries.
472,"00:40:27,793","00:40:29,692",Then let's run them down.
473,"00:40:34,499","00:40:35,765",Argh!
474,"00:40:37,169","00:40:38,334",Aah!
475,"00:40:39,571","00:40:41,838",Argh!
476,"00:40:54,586","00:40:55,985",Argh!
477,"00:42:10,896","00:42:14,597","Whoo, yeah, we kicked
demon boot-ay."
478,"00:42:14,599","00:42:15,865","Yeah, baby."
479,"00:42:16,268","00:42:17,333",Up top.
480,"00:42:18,436","00:42:19,502",Hit me.
481,"00:42:21,439","00:42:22,505",Hmm.
482,"00:42:33,718","00:42:36,519","Robin said I didn't know
enough about you."
483,"00:42:36,521","00:42:38,288",I think he was right.
484,"00:42:38,290","00:42:40,990","You told me
you didn't have a father."
485,"00:42:40,992","00:42:43,560","What I said is that
he's gone."
486,"00:42:43,562","00:42:45,194",That's not the same as dead.
487,"00:42:45,196","00:42:46,462",He's dead to me.
488,"00:42:48,366","00:42:50,333","So, why is he
trying to kill you?"
489,"00:42:52,437","00:42:54,037",He's not trying to kill me.
490,"00:42:54,739","00:42:56,306",It's much worse.
491,"00:43:12,891","00:43:16,025","Safe to say we're not in
Kansas anymore."
492,"00:43:16,027","00:43:18,828","It's no star field
i recognize."
493,"00:43:19,431","00:43:20,997",Where are we?
494,"00:43:22,000","00:43:23,900","Somewhere my father
can't see us."
495,"00:43:24,669","00:43:26,869","All right, let's hear it."
496,"00:43:27,806","00:43:29,238",There's so much.
497,"00:43:29,240","00:43:31,140",I guess it starts with my mom.
498,"00:43:36,381","00:43:39,515","She was young, rebellious
 and gullible."
499,"00:43:39,517","00:43:41,818","Of course she wound up
 in a cult."
500,"00:43:42,220","00:43:43,753","Anyway,"
501,"00:43:43,755","00:43:45,888","they decided to do
 the classic bride of
 Satan rite."
502,"00:43:45,890","00:43:48,992","And guess who got
 to be the lucky bride?"
503,"00:43:48,994","00:43:51,294","I doubt anyone
 expected it to work,"
504,"00:43:51,296","00:43:53,930","but the ancient ceremony
 turned out to be
 the real thing."
505,"00:44:15,820","00:44:17,120","So, mom,"
506,"00:44:17,122","00:44:19,122","with her great powers
 of judgment,"
507,"00:44:19,124","00:44:22,025","didn't hesitate to hook up
 with the guy who emerged
 from the smoke."
508,"00:44:33,405","00:44:34,971","Whoa, whoa,
 whoa, wait."
509,"00:44:34,973","00:44:37,306","So, your mom
did it with Satan?"
510,"00:44:37,308","00:44:40,610","His name is trigon,
but basically, yes."
511,"00:44:40,612","00:44:42,812",But they totally did it.
512,"00:44:42,814","00:44:44,681",Garfield?
513,"00:44:44,683","00:44:47,083","That was inappropriate.
Go on."
514,"00:44:47,585","00:44:49,686",It gets weirder.
515,"00:44:49,688","00:44:52,922","Mom fled the cult
and was on the run
with nowhere to go,"
516,"00:44:52,924","00:44:55,692","when she gets saved by
these people from
another dimension."
517,"00:44:59,197","00:45:01,364",The people of azarath.
518,"00:45:01,366","00:45:04,467","A realm of beauty,
 peace and tranquility"
519,"00:45:06,037","00:45:09,305","where, needless to say,
 I did not fit in."
520,"00:45:09,307","00:45:11,741","And I must have inherited
 my mom's terrible judgment"
521,"00:45:11,743","00:45:14,510","because I thought if
 I found out more about
 the monster who made me,"
522,"00:45:14,512","00:45:16,479","I'd be able to
 make sense of myself."
523,"00:45:50,215","00:45:51,481",Raven...
524,"00:46:09,000","00:46:12,034","Poor mother, poor azarath."
525,"00:46:12,036","00:46:14,070",I became its trojan horse.
526,"00:46:15,607","00:46:18,141","He took me to his
hellish universe."
527,"00:46:18,143","00:46:20,877","I could hardly bear
the horrors I saw there."
528,"00:46:20,879","00:46:22,578",Why did trigon want you?
529,"00:46:22,580","00:46:25,648","He wanted earth.
He's a conqueror of worlds."
530,"00:46:25,650","00:46:28,818","But he needs a
powerful conduit
to open earth to his control."
531,"00:46:28,820","00:46:30,753",And you're half human.
532,"00:46:30,755","00:46:32,155",His way in.
533,"00:46:32,157","00:46:34,757","But my magic was stronger
than he realized."
534,"00:46:34,759","00:46:38,795","Before he could use me,
 I was able to trap him
 inside a crystal."
535,"00:46:38,797","00:46:40,296",It should've held him.
536,"00:46:40,298","00:46:41,998","Perhaps if I had
 stayed there,"
537,"00:46:42,000","00:46:43,266",it would have.
538,"00:46:44,736","00:46:46,536",But I wanted a home.
539,"00:46:46,538","00:46:48,704","Why didn't you go back
to azarath?"
540,"00:46:49,974","00:46:51,307",This is azarath.
541,"00:47:09,027","00:47:10,860","Don't worry, I'm not staying."
542,"00:47:10,862","00:47:13,663","I've got to keep moving
to keep trigon off my path."
543,"00:47:13,665","00:47:15,064",Where will you go?
544,"00:47:15,066","00:47:16,632",It's better you not know.
545,"00:47:16,634","00:47:19,368","He's going to try to use you
but don't worry,"
546,"00:47:19,370","00:47:21,938","I put a protective spell
on you, just in case."
547,"00:47:21,940","00:47:24,473","And I thought I had
a bad burrito."
548,"00:47:24,475","00:47:25,942",Dude.
549,"00:47:25,944","00:47:28,711","Guess I should've gotten
your permission or whatever."
550,"00:47:28,713","00:47:30,713","But I couldn't stand for him
to corrupt you."
551,"00:47:30,715","00:47:33,149","You're the only friends
I've ever really had."
552,"00:47:33,852","00:47:35,151",I'll...
553,"00:47:35,687","00:47:36,752",Miss you.
554,"00:47:41,526","00:47:43,192",Wait!
555,"00:47:43,194","00:47:45,928","Leave now and you'll
always be running."
556,"00:47:45,930","00:47:47,730","You have no idea
what he's like, Damian."
557,"00:47:47,732","00:47:49,699","You've never met
a monster like trigon."
558,"00:47:49,701","00:47:51,234",You beat him once.
559,"00:47:51,970","00:47:53,469",I was lucky.
560,"00:47:53,471","00:47:55,805","Now you'll be four times
as lucky."
561,"00:47:55,807","00:47:58,107","If we can't save
one of our own,"
562,"00:47:58,109","00:47:59,375",who can we save?
563,"00:47:59,377","00:48:02,011",I thought you hated us.
564,"00:48:02,013","00:48:04,280","I'm not wishing you
dead anymore."
565,"00:48:04,282","00:48:07,016","Robin's right,
we are your best hope."
566,"00:48:17,829","00:48:19,328","Down, boy."
567,"00:48:19,330","00:48:21,030",We heard about the attack.
568,"00:48:21,032","00:48:22,832",Was she at the center?
569,"00:48:22,834","00:48:26,068","Her father is
an inter-dimensional demon.
He was after her."
570,"00:48:26,070","00:48:28,104",She's coming with us.
571,"00:48:28,106","00:48:30,172","No, we can handle this."
572,"00:48:30,174","00:48:32,642","If she's part of this,
we need to know."
573,"00:48:32,644","00:48:33,709",We can protect her.
574,"00:48:38,049","00:48:43,185","I'm sorry, raven.
We've had two magic attacks
and superman is still missing."
575,"00:48:43,187","00:48:45,454","- No.
- What's the matter?"
576,"00:48:45,456","00:48:47,690","He knows they're here,
he wants them here."
577,"00:48:47,692","00:48:49,025",Who?
578,"00:48:49,027","00:48:50,693","If they stay,
everything will be lost."
579,"00:48:50,695","00:48:54,163","This is our job, father,
you have to leave."
580,"00:48:54,165","00:48:55,932",Father?
581,"00:48:55,934","00:48:57,600",She's coming with us.
582,"00:48:57,602","00:48:58,834",She stays here.
583,"00:49:03,675","00:49:06,342","Maybe we should all
take a breath."
584,"00:49:06,344","00:49:08,344","Too late, they're here."
585,"00:49:12,817","00:49:13,916",Great hera!
586,"00:49:14,986","00:49:16,085",Argh!
587,"00:49:16,087","00:49:18,654",Argh! We're being compromised.
588,"00:49:19,891","00:49:21,857","-Father!
-Get back."
589,"00:49:26,331","00:49:29,198","-What the hell?
-It's a nerve toxin."
590,"00:49:29,200","00:49:30,666",For bane.
591,"00:49:34,739","00:49:36,238",Dude...
592,"00:49:43,281","00:49:46,949","The Kryptonian has unearthed
the infernal shrine, raven."
593,"00:49:46,951","00:49:48,250",The who did the what?
594,"00:49:48,252","00:49:50,152","An ancient shrine
built by satanists."
595,"00:49:50,154","00:49:51,787",It has magical properties.
596,"00:49:51,789","00:49:55,091","You are the shrine's
final piece."
597,"00:49:55,093","00:49:56,859",She stays here.
598,"00:49:56,861","00:49:59,528",You dare challenge us?
599,"00:50:44,108","00:50:45,374",Whoa!
600,"00:50:59,924","00:51:01,323",Argh!
601,"00:51:11,936","00:51:13,636",Beetle...
602,"00:51:23,714","00:51:24,780",Ugh!
603,"00:51:31,389","00:51:33,823","I will break her, raven."
604,"00:51:35,193","00:51:38,461","I stop my hand for an instant
and this one dies, too."
605,"00:51:38,930","00:51:40,763",Wait!
606,"00:51:40,765","00:51:43,933","I'll go. As the daughter of
your lord trigon,"
607,"00:51:43,935","00:51:46,869","I order you to release
these feeble humans."
608,"00:52:03,921","00:52:04,920",Goodbye.
609,"00:52:17,368","00:52:18,968",Get him inside.
610,"00:52:41,425","00:52:43,826",Your father awaits.
611,"00:52:43,828","00:52:44,994",Don't touch me.
612,"00:53:04,882","00:53:08,083","There had better be
 no trickery this time, girl,"
613,"00:53:08,085","00:53:11,554","if you want any mercy
 shown your friends."
614,"00:53:12,089","00:53:13,489",No tricks.
615,"00:53:13,491","00:53:16,325","Look, I'm begging you,
leave this world alone."
616,"00:53:16,327","00:53:18,294",And thwart destiny?
617,"00:53:18,296","00:53:21,163",We were meant to be together.
618,"00:53:21,165","00:53:22,531",Always.
619,"00:53:23,100","00:53:24,867",And we shall.
620,"00:54:00,004","00:54:01,604",Think he's back online.
621,"00:54:02,440","00:54:04,206",Holy crap!
622,"00:54:04,208","00:54:07,576","-Did that sound
demonic to anyone else?
-A little."
623,"00:54:09,080","00:54:10,746",The things it made me see.
624,"00:54:11,582","00:54:14,516","Cyborg, how do we save raven?"
625,"00:54:15,219","00:54:16,518",I...
626,"00:54:16,520","00:54:18,487",I don't think you can.
627,"00:54:22,660","00:54:25,194","Oh, no. How bad is he?"
628,"00:54:26,731","00:54:28,731",He's been out for 24 hours.
629,"00:54:28,733","00:54:30,299","He sacrificed himself,"
630,"00:54:30,301","00:54:34,236","risked death to give us
a fighting chance at life."
631,"00:54:34,238","00:54:36,472","Which is more than I can say
for the rest of the league."
632,"00:54:36,474","00:54:39,341","Damian, this isn't
the time to squabble."
633,"00:54:39,343","00:54:40,542",We have to get raven back.
634,"00:54:40,544","00:54:43,245","We don't even know
where she is."
635,"00:54:43,247","00:54:47,349","She's in the middle east,
60 miles north
of kahndaq city."
636,"00:54:47,351","00:54:49,685","-How do you...
-I put a tracer on her."
637,"00:54:49,687","00:54:52,488","-When?
-About 30 seconds
after we met."
638,"00:54:52,490","00:54:54,590","Same time I put one
on each of you."
639,"00:54:56,027","00:54:57,693",What?
640,"00:54:57,695","00:55:01,530","Cyborg, you have the ability
to manifest boom tubes,
do you not?"
641,"00:55:01,532","00:55:03,198","Yeah, I can boom us there."
642,"00:55:03,200","00:55:05,801","But you guys barely held
your own against flash
and wonder woman,"
643,"00:55:05,803","00:55:08,404","and that's without superman
being on deck."
644,"00:55:08,406","00:55:10,105","He shouldn't
be a problem."
645,"00:55:10,107","00:55:13,509","Yeah, right, like you got
a way to take out superman."
646,"00:55:19,317","00:55:20,949","Oh, my god, I think he does."
647,"00:55:37,768","00:55:39,201",You heard the plan.
648,"00:55:40,071","00:55:41,637","Titans, go!"
649,"00:56:27,418","00:56:29,051",You mind removing that?
650,"00:56:39,163","00:56:40,028",What?
651,"00:56:43,234","00:56:44,333",Damian.
652,"00:56:45,136","00:56:46,201",Starfire.
653,"00:56:47,405","00:56:48,771",You okayed this?
654,"00:56:50,841","00:56:51,907",Yes.
655,"00:56:52,977","00:56:54,042",Good call.
656,"00:56:57,148","00:56:59,248","It's okay, it's healing."
657,"00:57:13,597","00:57:17,166","I've got flash,
the rest of you
get raven off that thing."
658,"00:57:35,286","00:57:36,652",Aah!
659,"00:57:37,521","00:57:38,787",Argh!
660,"00:57:45,029","00:57:47,362","Barry, if you can hear me
in there,"
661,"00:57:48,299","00:57:49,364",sorry.
662,"00:57:58,142","00:58:00,108",Ow.
663,"00:58:00,110","00:58:02,544","How long will it take you
to heal?"
664,"00:58:02,546","00:58:04,813","Ah, oh, my god,
an hour?"
665,"00:58:04,815","00:58:06,849","Also, seriously?"
666,"00:58:06,851","00:58:08,383",You've got 10 minutes.
667,"00:58:31,208","00:58:34,877","Your power is no match for
that of trigon, Kryptonian."
668,"00:58:34,879","00:58:36,912","She doesn't belong
to you, devil."
669,"00:58:50,094","00:58:52,761","Let me go, you alien filth."
670,"00:58:57,735","00:58:59,535",You sicken me.
671,"00:58:59,537","00:59:01,803",I never cared.
672,"00:59:01,805","00:59:03,639",I never loved you.
673,"00:59:03,641","00:59:05,140",Who are you?
674,"00:59:05,142","00:59:08,343","I am corruption incarnate,"
675,"00:59:08,345","00:59:11,513",you piece of...
676,"00:59:11,515","00:59:13,916",The lasso commands you answer.
677,"00:59:14,652","00:59:15,717",Argh!
678,"00:59:15,719","00:59:18,287",I... I...
679,"00:59:18,289","00:59:19,354",Argh!
680,"00:59:22,426","00:59:25,060",I am Diana of Themyscira.
681,"00:59:25,462","00:59:26,828",Argh!
682,"00:59:32,770","00:59:34,469",It's okay.
683,"00:59:34,471","00:59:35,904",I've got you now.
684,"00:59:37,508","00:59:38,774",Mmm...
685,"00:59:39,476","00:59:41,209",Just like in the movies.
686,"01:00:10,107","01:00:13,775","You can get off my back now,
boy bony-ass."
687,"01:00:19,617","01:00:21,416",- You all right?
688,"01:00:22,720","01:00:24,186",Nothing is right.
689,"01:00:26,590","01:00:28,290",Run!
690,"01:00:28,292","01:00:29,858","Everyone, run!"
691,"01:01:01,492","01:01:03,392","Well, this sucks."
692,"01:01:08,365","01:01:09,531",Great hera.
693,"01:01:24,048","01:01:25,847",He'll bring hell on earth.
694,"01:01:25,849","01:01:27,783",How do we stop him?
695,"01:01:27,785","01:01:31,219","-There's only one way.
-You're going to put him back
in the crystal."
696,"01:01:31,221","01:01:33,288","In the unlikely event
that I can make it there."
697,"01:01:37,895","01:01:38,994",He's heading for the city.
698,"01:01:38,996","01:01:40,429","Superman,"
699,"01:01:40,431","01:01:41,596",raven has a plan.
700,"01:01:42,599","01:01:43,999",The titans need my help.
701,"01:01:46,403","01:01:47,569",I'm going to hell.
702,"01:01:52,543","01:01:57,345","Oh, I don't feel so good."
703,"01:01:57,347","01:01:59,314","The crystal can only
be touched by me."
704,"01:01:59,316","01:02:01,349","He may have escaped it,
but he can't destroy it."
705,"01:02:01,351","01:02:03,618","I just hope he left a trail
of breadcrumbs."
706,"01:02:17,668","01:02:19,334","Home, sweet home."
707,"01:02:20,337","01:02:22,671","Can't you just
transport us inside?"
708,"01:02:22,673","01:02:24,339","No, it's shielded."
709,"01:02:40,390","01:02:43,125","Maybe this
will slow you down."
710,"01:02:48,699","01:02:49,765",Ugh...
711,"01:02:59,943","01:03:01,409",Garfield!
712,"01:03:02,713","01:03:05,046","Dude, what the hell?"
713,"01:03:55,933","01:03:57,933","Gar, you still with us?"
714,"01:04:25,729","01:04:27,662",Little help!
715,"01:04:37,808","01:04:40,575","-If we cannot stop
this creature...
-I know."
716,"01:05:05,669","01:05:06,768",Argh!
717,"01:05:14,244","01:05:17,779","Welcome home,
sister."
718,"01:05:23,220","01:05:24,886",It's the freak show again.
719,"01:06:07,297","01:06:09,164",Get inside!
720,"01:07:03,920","01:07:05,220",Dude!
721,"01:07:39,022","01:07:40,755",Grandfather?
722,"01:07:40,757","01:07:43,358","Damian, my blood."
723,"01:07:45,495","01:07:48,663",It's a trick. I saw you die.
724,"01:07:48,665","01:07:52,000","No trick. It's me.
I assure you."
725,"01:07:52,636","01:07:54,402",I exist.
726,"01:07:54,404","01:07:56,671",Lord trigon is my sustenance.
727,"01:07:59,543","01:08:02,043","-He's a devil.
-No."
728,"01:08:02,045","01:08:04,412",He's a god of necessity.
729,"01:08:04,414","01:08:06,414","How do you think I attained
my power?"
730,"01:08:06,416","01:08:08,883","Where do you think
the Lazarus pits came from?"
731,"01:08:09,519","01:08:11,753","It's all his doing,"
732,"01:08:11,755","01:08:15,623","and he can make things
whole again for a price."
733,"01:08:15,625","01:08:18,159","He can give us the world
we wanted."
734,"01:08:18,161","01:08:21,563",You and I. A perfect world.
735,"01:08:21,565","01:08:24,866","She's the only one
who stands in the way."
736,"01:08:24,868","01:08:26,534","Prove your love, grandson."
737,"01:08:26,536","01:08:28,837",Take care of this for me.
738,"01:08:28,839","01:08:32,340","Before my pact
with trigon expires."
739,"01:08:33,410","01:08:37,278","I... I would do anything
to bring you back,"
740,"01:08:37,280","01:08:39,781","but, grandfather, I don't..."
741,"01:08:39,783","01:08:40,949",You hesitate.
742,"01:08:41,818","01:08:43,485",Why?
743,"01:08:43,487","01:08:47,622","Are you afraid to do
the one act that will
restore me to life?"
744,"01:08:47,624","01:08:49,524",I'm not afraid of anything.
745,"01:08:49,526","01:08:51,659",You dare disobey me?
746,"01:08:51,661","01:08:53,561","Have you forgotten
your heritage?"
747,"01:08:53,563","01:08:55,630",You are an al ghul.
748,"01:08:56,199","01:08:58,700","No, I'm a titan."
749,"01:09:06,176","01:09:08,710",Stupid girl.
750,"01:09:08,712","01:09:13,515","You think your allies
 can stop me
 now that I'm here?"
751,"01:09:13,517","01:09:19,921","The justice league,
 defenders of this realm,
 less than insects to me."
752,"01:09:19,923","01:09:24,292","I will strip bare the flesh
 from their bones."
753,"01:09:24,294","01:09:29,564","And your pathetic friends,
 I will make them
 suffer endlessly,"
754,"01:09:29,566","01:09:33,368",and you will have to watch.
755,"01:09:33,370","01:09:37,906","Soon, your souls will belong
 to trigon,"
756,"01:09:37,908","01:09:41,576",as will your world.
757,"01:09:58,595","01:10:00,929","Your friends
have made you soft."
758,"01:10:01,498","01:10:03,598",Ungrateful child.
759,"01:10:03,600","01:10:07,368","You could have been immortal,
like me."
760,"01:10:08,071","01:10:10,638",Give up.
761,"01:10:10,640","01:10:13,408","You're too weak
 to stop me, raven."
762,"01:10:13,410","01:10:14,976",You always have been.
763,"01:10:16,079","01:10:17,745",Just like your mother.
764,"01:10:17,747","01:10:20,882","No, my only weakness
 was loving you,"
765,"01:10:21,618","01:10:23,918",hoping I'd be loved in return.
766,"01:10:23,920","01:10:26,487","But all you were capable
 of giving is pain,"
767,"01:10:27,123","01:10:28,423",so I ran away
768,"01:10:29,192","01:10:30,558","and found friends,"
769,"01:10:31,661","01:10:33,494","friends I would give
 my life for,"
770,"01:10:34,431","01:10:35,964",friends who give me love
771,"01:10:37,100","01:10:38,633",and the strength to do this.
772,"01:11:12,102","01:11:14,002","Damian, save me!"
773,"01:11:32,822","01:11:34,789","Grant me the strength
of mighty azarath"
774,"01:11:34,791","01:11:38,860","to contain the demon trigon
within this sacred shard,
now and forever."
775,"01:11:58,248","01:11:59,580",Huh?
776,"01:13:00,610","01:13:01,943",Raven!
777,"01:13:04,280","01:13:06,047",Is it over?
778,"01:13:06,049","01:13:07,715",It'll never be over.
779,"01:13:07,717","01:13:10,818","Trigon will spend
every single minute
trying to get out of here,"
780,"01:13:10,820","01:13:14,555","so he needs to be watched
every single minute."
781,"01:13:17,627","01:13:19,093","Dude, thanks for helping out."
782,"01:13:19,095","01:13:21,162","It was nice to have
a big gun around."
783,"01:13:21,164","01:13:24,966","Yeah, you ought to dump
those stuck-up jerks
and sign up with us."
784,"01:13:24,968","01:13:27,135","It was nice not to be
the kid for once,"
785,"01:13:27,137","01:13:29,303","but when you've been
in the majors..."
786,"01:13:29,305","01:13:30,605",You know what I'm saying.
787,"01:13:39,449","01:13:40,748",Time to go home.
788,"01:13:45,422","01:13:46,721",I'll take you back.
789,"01:13:54,998","01:13:56,130","Unfortunately,"
790,"01:13:58,301","01:13:59,667",this is my home.
791,"01:14:02,472","01:14:03,771",I have to watch him.
792,"01:14:06,342","01:14:07,742",It's not your home.
793,"01:14:08,445","01:14:10,244",Home is the place where...
794,"01:14:10,246","01:14:14,982","When you have to go there,
they have to take you in."
795,"01:14:14,984","01:14:19,287","Robert frost.
You are full of surprises,
Damian."
796,"01:14:20,190","01:14:21,589",You're coming with us.
797,"01:14:35,438","01:14:37,405","I've sifted through
 all the data"
798,"01:14:37,407","01:14:39,540","and found no signs
 of the corruptors
 for the 10 days"
799,"01:14:39,542","01:14:42,143","since our encounter
 with trigon."
800,"01:14:42,145","01:14:44,545","In other words,
 great work, titans."
801,"01:14:44,547","01:14:48,850","Your determination
 and teamwork saved the world,"
802,"01:14:48,852","01:14:52,320","and us. You should be
 very proud of them, kori."
803,"01:14:56,326","01:14:57,658",As are we.
804,"01:15:01,264","01:15:02,797","Hey, guys, it's pizza night."
805,"01:15:02,799","01:15:04,932","Boom tube delivery.
Less than 30..."
806,"01:15:07,136","01:15:08,269",Minutes.
807,"01:15:09,639","01:15:11,205","Carry on, titans."
808,"01:15:13,576","01:15:15,176","Okay, that was awkward."
809,"01:15:16,179","01:15:17,979",Enough talk. Let's eat.
810,"01:15:22,685","01:15:24,952","Hey, isn't that..."
811,"01:15:24,954","01:15:26,754","He always said
we should be together."
812,"01:15:27,824","01:15:29,690","That's gotta be torture
for him."
813,"01:15:30,960","01:15:33,694","Well, you can take the girl
out of hell..."
814,"01:15:33,696","01:15:35,696","Raven, release me."
815,"01:15:35,698","01:15:39,934","You're too weak
 to keep me in here,
 you filthy witch!"
816,"01:15:39,936","01:15:43,437","I'll get out!
 I'll kill everyone you love."
817,"01:15:43,439","01:15:45,039",Raven!
