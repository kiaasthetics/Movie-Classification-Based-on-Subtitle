grandma's potatoes."
53,"00:06:33,040","00:06:34,210",I don't want hers.
54,"00:06:34,360","00:06:36,410","Tyler, knock it off."
55,"00:06:36,410","00:06:38,390","Okay, egg white omelet for you."
56,"00:06:38,390","00:06:40,450","- Honey.
- Yes, ma'am?"
57,"00:06:40,680","00:06:42,810",You remind me of my daughter.
58,"00:06:42,810","00:06:47,000","- Doesn't she look like Stephanie?
- Mom, I'm your daughter. Stephanie."
59,"00:06:47,030","00:06:48,360",I'm your daughter.
60,"00:06:49,970","00:06:53,690","- Tabasco?

- Late?"
63,"00:07:00,620","00:07:03,260","- You trying to be funny?
- No, she's not answering her phone."
64,"00:07:03,260","00:07:05,790","She might have overslept.
Can you do a double?"
65,"00:07:05,790","00:07:08,400","Can't, I got plans with my kid.
Call Alan."
66,"00:07:14,340","00:07:16,470","Okay, hot coffee."
67,"00:07:17,940","00:07:20,880","No, no, no. I would like

70,"00:07:28,930","00:07:31,600","- Claire.
- What? Like we're supposed to guess?"
71,"00:07:31,600","00:07:34,180","- I'll be right back.
- Do your job."
72,"00:07:35,770","00:07:37,840","Okay, I'm so sorry about that.
Here you go."
73,"00:07:38,310","00:07:39,860",Silverware.
74,"00:07:40,770","00:07:43,290","- Is everybody good here now?
- He's sulking."
75,"00:07:43,290","00:07:44,850",I am not.
76,"00:07:45,650","00:07:47,680","You know what, can you just bring us side hash browns?"
77,"00:07:47,680","00:07:50,290","- Burnt on the edges.
- Burnt on the edges, coming up."
78,"00:07:50,360","00:07:51,510","- We're good.
- Okay."
79,"00:07:51,510","00:07:53,200",Still waiting on my eggs.
80,"00:07:54,020","00:07:55,910",Right. Your eggs are coming right up.
81,"00:07:55,910","00:07:57,430","Yeah, and can I actually get..."
82,"00:07:57,430","00:07:59,960","Can I switch to wheat toast
instead of white toast, is that alright?"
83,"00:07:59,990","00:08:01,850","Yeah, wheat instead of white.
Yep, got it."
84,"00:08:01,850","00:08:03,470","- Thank you.
- Be right back."
85,"00:08:03,470","00:08:06,030","New side of hash browns,
burnt on the edges."
86,"00:08:06,030","00:08:07,460",Copy.
87,"00:08:08,400","00:08:09,750",Miss!
88,"00:08:12,500","00:08:13,530",Don't yell.
89,"00:08:13,880","00:08:14,810",Miss!
90,"00:08:14,810","00:08:16,720","- Please stop yelling.
- Shut up."
91,"00:08:18,550","00:08:19,560","Yeah, yeah, I get it."
92,"00:08:19,560","00:08:22,460","But Karla's kid sitting here waiting
for her to take him to the park."
93,"00:08:23,840","00:08:25,730","Yeah, so you can come in?"
94,"00:08:25,870","00:08:27,500",So come in.
95,"00:08:28,980","00:08:30,370",Here you go.
96,"00:08:30,680","00:08:36,430","All the herbal tea you could
possibly want and two menus."
97,"00:08:38,850","00:08:40,690",Is your oatmeal steel?
98,"00:08:40,920","00:08:42,950","- What?
- Cut."
99,"00:08:43,100","00:08:46,830","- Are your oats steel-cut?
- No, they're Quaker."
100,"00:08:50,770","00:08:53,000","- Should I come back...
- No, no."
101,"00:08:53,000","00:08:55,060",Oatmeal with...
102,"00:08:55,480","00:08:57,480",I'll take with with reduced fat almond.
103,"00:08:59,000","00:09:01,060","Oh, let me guess,
you only have wholemeal?"
104,"00:09:01,060","00:09:02,930","- From the Outer?
- No, from AMP."
105,"00:09:02,930","00:09:05,910","Why don't I just apply it
directly to my thighs?"
106,"00:09:06,670","00:09:08,290",You could use some help.
107,"00:09:11,410","00:09:13,130","Karla, go ahead and go."
108,"00:09:13,280","00:09:15,580","- Really?
- Yeah. Dale found Agnes."
109,"00:09:15,840","00:09:18,580","- She should be here in 15 minutes.
- Awesome."
110,"00:09:18,580","00:09:21,660","- Who wants to go to the park?
- I am!"
111,"00:09:23,450","00:09:24,850",Let's go.
112,"00:10:54,700","00:10:56,830","Mommy, your turn."
113,"00:11:01,010","00:11:03,050",Is daddy coming to the fair?
114,"00:11:03,630","00:11:06,470","No, sweetheart.
You're gonna see daddy next weekend."
115,"00:11:06,840","00:11:09,390",And maybe you'll get to see Cheryl too.
116,"00:11:11,770","00:11:13,370",Do you like Cheryl?
117,"00:11:16,080","00:11:19,550","- I don't know.
- I think she's nice, Frankie."
118,"00:11:19,960","00:11:23,340","And she's smart.
She's very smart."
119,"00:11:23,340","00:11:27,200","- She's gonna be a doctor.
- Yeah, I know."
120,"00:11:28,160","00:11:30,760","And I want you to really
make friends with her, okay?"
121,"00:11:30,760","00:11:32,190",Are you friends with her?
122,"00:11:33,140","00:11:34,270",Yeah.
123,"00:11:34,620","00:11:35,820","Yeah, I am."
124,"00:11:35,820","00:11:39,600","She, daddy and I,
we all love somebody like crazy."
125,"00:11:39,850","00:11:43,110","- Do you know who that is?
- Me!"
126,"00:11:43,200","00:11:44,880",You!
127,"00:11:48,030","00:11:49,290",You.
128,"00:11:50,660","00:11:52,660",We all love you.
129,"00:12:22,650","00:12:24,430","Mommy, can I get ice cream?"
130,"00:12:24,430","00:12:27,460","You know what, how about
we check out all of our options first..."
131,"00:12:27,460","00:12:28,860",...and then maybe we'll come back.
132,"00:12:29,160","00:12:30,970","- Okay? Come on.
- Okay."
133,"00:12:47,090","00:12:48,780",Can I get my face painted?
134,"00:12:48,800","00:12:50,840","How about we wait until
the line is a little shorter?"
135,"00:12:50,840","00:12:52,020","We'll come back, okay?"
136,"00:13:04,690","00:13:08,110","- Marco.
- Polo."
137,"00:13:09,050","00:13:12,080","- How old your boy?
- Six."
138,"00:13:12,790","00:13:14,800",He obviously likes to hide.
139,"00:13:25,090","00:13:26,480",Marco.
140,"00:13:27,410","00:13:29,770","Oh, Marco."
141,"00:13:30,360","00:13:32,020","Oh, no."
142,"00:13:32,570","00:13:35,950",Am I lost my little Frankie forever?
143,"00:13:36,830","00:13:38,900",Where could he be?
144,"00:13:39,500","00:13:41,220",There you are.
145,"00:13:43,200","00:13:44,620","Come on, let's go see the show."
146,"00:14:04,440","00:14:06,310",Can I get my face painted now?
147,"00:14:06,910","00:14:09,350","Yeah, as soon as this song is over,
okay sweetheart?"
148,"00:14:12,420","00:14:14,620","Frankie, I'm gonna need
my phone for one second."
149,"00:14:14,620","00:14:16,290",There you go. Let's switch.
150,"00:14:16,400","00:14:17,520",Hello?
151,"00:14:19,280","00:14:20,250",Yeah.
152,"00:14:21,120","00:14:23,150",Can you hold on just one second?
153,"00:14:23,590","00:14:24,890","Okay. Frankie, listen."
154,"00:14:24,890","00:14:27,630","I'm gonna have to go over there
and take this phone call, okay?"
155,"00:14:27,660","00:14:30,520","It's really important.
Don't move, okay?"
156,"00:14:30,630","00:14:32,910","- Marco.
- Polo."
157,"00:14:34,140","00:14:35,370",Don't move.
158,"00:14:36,440","00:14:38,500","Okay, I'm sorry. Go ahead."
159,"00:14:41,690","00:14:43,140",He wants what?
160,"00:14:45,170","00:14:47,130",Primary custody?
161,"00:14:49,180","00:14:51,870","Well, he can't have that.
I mean, can he?"
162,"00:14:54,560","00:14:58,270","My batteries are gonna die, Mr. Jackson.
If it does, I'll call you back, okay?"
163,"00:14:58,770","00:15:01,010","- Marco.
- Polo."
164,"00:15:02,120","00:15:03,610",I'm sorry. What?
165,"00:15:04,420","00:15:07,140",I can't hear you. Say that again.
166,"00:15:08,340","00:15:13,460","Yes, yes, I have a job.
I have a regular job. Yes."
167,"00:15:15,300","00:15:17,640",Is that even gonna matter to the court?
168,"00:15:19,050","00:15:21,290","Well, yeah, he's in real estate."
169,"00:15:21,290","00:15:25,850","And his girlfriend is a pediatrician
and I'm a waitress."
170,"00:15:25,920","00:15:28,110",So you do the math. Marco.
171,"00:15:28,110","00:15:29,680",Polo.
172,"00:15:31,820","00:15:33,950","Let me tell you something, Mr. Jackson."
173,"00:15:34,610","00:15:38,910","If he thinks that he's gonna take
my son away from me just because..."
174,"00:15:50,130","00:15:51,600",Frankie.
175,"00:15:52,760","00:15:54,150",Frankie.
176,"00:15:58,140","00:15:59,340",Frankie.
177,"00:16:00,600","00:16:01,420","Excuse me, ma'am."
178,"00:16:01,420","00:16:03,490","Did you see where my little boy was
that was right here?"
179,"00:16:03,880","00:16:06,020","No, I didn't. I'm sorry."
180,"00:16:07,690","00:16:09,350",Marco.
181,"00:16:11,500","00:16:13,590","Oh, Marco!"
182,"00:16:14,520","00:16:16,480","Are you hiding, Frankie?"
183,"00:16:19,720","00:16:21,240",Marco.
184,"00:16:23,850","00:16:25,560",Marco!
185,"00:16:31,420","00:16:34,810",Frankie. You left your toy.
186,"00:16:37,550","00:16:39,680","Are you hiding, Frankie?"
187,"00:16:41,750","00:16:43,150",Marco.
188,"00:16:43,850","00:16:45,220",Frankie.
189,"00:16:45,430","00:16:48,590","- You can't find your son?
- No, I can't find him."
190,"00:16:48,590","00:16:49,870","- I don't know where he is.

392,"00:43:55,720","00:43:58,830","You have no idea
what to even do right now."
393,"00:43:58,830","00:43:59,810",You need her...
394,"00:43:59,810","00:44:01,960","You need her to tell you

stay in touch with you?"

- I can't."
567,"01:18:33,260","01:18:36,230","I can't, honey,
because the ladder is locked."
568,"01:18:36,660","01:18:40,470","So you're gonna have to come down

No, no, Frankie, don't."

You can't fit through there."
571,"01:18:46,030","01:18:49,310","- No, just wait a second.
- Grab me."
572,"01:18:49,310","01:18:52,700","Put your legs up, Frankie,
so mommy can hit with the shovel."

Come on."
581,"01:20:04,960","01:20:07,350","- Come on, girls. Come on.

584,"01:20:13,870","01:20:16,480","We're gonna play the quiet game, okay?"
585,"01:20:16,480","01:20:19,550","I need both of you to be very quiet,
don't make a sound, okay?"
586,"01:20:19,550","01:20:22,660","I'm gonna come back.
I'm gonna come back for you, okay?"

592,"01:24:33,550","01:24:35,540","I'm gonna go get the girls, okay?"
593,"01:24:35,910","01:24:37,430",We'll get them out of here.
594,"01:24:39,680","01:24:43,100","Hi, you guys, I'm back."

Come on down."
597,"01:24:48,450","01:24:51,110","Come on, honey. I'm here to help you.
It's okay."
598,"01:24:54,290","01:24:56,050",What the hell is going on here?
599,"01:24:56,360","01:24:57,970",Who the hell are you?
600,"01:25:00,570","01:25:02,460","- Who are you?
- I live next door."
601,"01:25:02,460","01:25:04,000",I heard gunshots.
602,"01:25:04,880","01:25:06,310",Where's Margo?
603,"01:25:08,060","01:25:10,580","- In the water.

604,"01:25:10,620","01:25:11,820",Yeah.
605,"01:25:12,680","01:25:14,700",She and her husband kidnapped my son.
606,"01:25:15,340","01:25:18,350","I've lived next to the Vicky's
for 14 years."
607,"01:25:19,610","01:25:21,610","They ain't kidnappers.
You turn around."
608,"01:25:26,480","01:25:28,020","I called the police, you know."
609,"01:25:29,950","01:25:34,300","- Who's up there?
- Those are kids. More abducted kids."
610,"01:25:35,200","01:25:37,860","Yeah, they're up there in that hole."

614,"01:25:48,920","01:25:51,350","We're gonna get you down
from there right now."
615,"01:25:51,400","01:25:55,510","- I wanna go home!
- We are gonna go home right now."
616,"01:25:55,510","01:25:56,910",Both of you.
617,"01:25:58,200","01:26:00,190",Just come to the opening.
618,"01:26:00,690","01:26:02,230","Come on, girls."
619,"01:26:02,800","01:26:03,870",Come on.
620,"01:26:04,300","01:26:06,870","Wait a minute.
I never told you how many."
621,"01:26:09,250","01:26:11,830",And I never told you they were girls.
622,"01:26:27,100","01:26:29,870",You took the wrong kid.
623,"01:26:50,750","01:26:52,500","Oh, sweetheart..."

with her son tonight."
628,"01:27:55,950","01:27:59,390","After what police called it
an unprecedented civilian pursuit."
629,"01:27:59,390","01:28:03,410","Amazingly, the mother got into her
own vehicle and chase the suspects."
630,"01:28:03,410","01:28:05,120",A police spokesman has confirmed...
631,"01:28:05,120","01:28:08,070","...the break of an overseas
