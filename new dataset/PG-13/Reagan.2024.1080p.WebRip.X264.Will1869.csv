I am more capable?"
121,"00:07:59,244","00:08:00,804","Because of who you are,
Comrade."

133,"00:08:53,924","00:08:55,924","Some say
I was responsible"

of the Soviet Union."
135,"00:08:58,764","00:09:00,844","Let's rest

137,"00:09:06,324","00:09:07,284",The actor.
138,"00:09:20,404","00:09:21,724",He will win.

147,"00:09:59,364","00:10:01,404","Yes, I was there."
148,"00:10:05,164","00:10:08,083","When I began as analyst,
we had one goal:"

we invaded with military force,"

for the USA."

and influence their key players"

their labor unions into one"
157,"00:10:41,683","00:10:43,603",which we could control.
158,"00:10:44,524","00:10:47,324","But it's the wrong question
you ask."
159,"00:10:47,404","00:10:51,964","History is never about when,
where why, how."
160,"00:10:52,044","00:10:54,443",It always comes down to who.

the facade."
169,"00:11:20,484","00:11:25,564","And I learned to never leave
a detail behind as unimportant,"
170,"00:11:25,684","00:11:26,604",because...

193,"00:12:42,284","00:12:44,764","Trust me, the studios control
every word I write."
194,"00:12:44,843","00:12:46,044","And God help me,
if I don't write,"
195,"00:12:46,124","00:12:47,603","or you don't read
what they tell us to."
196,"00:12:47,684","00:12:49,164","Uh, they're paying
the bills, Dalton."
197,"00:12:49,243","00:12:50,684","- They should have some say.
- Yes."
198,"00:12:50,764","00:12:52,004","I mean, we're doing
pretty well, aren't we?"
199,"00:12:52,084","00:12:54,084","- I think so.
- You don't get it, Holden."
200,"00:12:54,163","00:12:56,764","All we are is a mouthpiece
to a system,"
201,"00:12:56,844","00:12:59,764","to a society, a society
that ignores the working man."
202,"00:12:59,844","00:13:00,964","Trust me, it won't last."
203,"00:13:02,244","00:13:04,564","Well, what do you mean
by that, Dalton?"
204,"00:13:04,644","00:13:05,884",Exactly what it says.
205,"00:13:05,963","00:13:07,644","Honey, come on.
Let's go dance."
206,"00:13:07,724","00:13:09,644","Just a second, honey.
No, no, really,"
207,"00:13:09,724","00:13:11,684","explain it to me.
I'd like to know."
208,"00:13:11,764","00:13:15,884","Well, let's just say
this whole American Dream thing"
209,"00:13:15,964","00:13:18,084","doesn't exactly apply
to everyone equally."
210,"00:13:18,163","00:13:19,924","And some of us
aren't sitting still for it."
211,"00:13:20,004","00:13:21,684",We're doing something about it.
212,"00:13:21,764","00:13:23,004",Doing what?
213,"00:13:23,684","00:13:26,244","Dalton, maybe we should talk
about this some other time."
214,"00:13:27,044","00:13:29,524","At some point, you're gonna
need to pick a side."
215,"00:13:30,484","00:13:34,164","Well, not tonight."
216,"00:13:34,244","00:13:36,804","Tonight, the only thing I'm
gonna pick is my dance partner"
217,"00:13:36,884","00:13:39,004","and I'm dancing
with my beautiful wife."
218,"00:13:39,843","00:13:42,124","If you'll excuse me,
fellas, and lady."
219,"00:13:42,204","00:13:43,563",We'll be back.
220,"00:13:45,483","00:13:49,603","He did not initially appear
to be a great concern for us."
221,"00:13:49,723","00:13:52,203","He was too busy
enjoying his honeymoon."
222,"00:13:52,323","00:13:55,644","Not to mention,
the Hollywood glitz and glamour."
223,"00:13:57,564","00:14:01,284","To understand
what made this man unique,"
224,"00:14:01,404","00:14:04,484",I needed to understand the boy.

in the middle of America."
226,"00:14:17,084","00:14:19,324","His father
had a nickname for him."

to crowds at an early age,"
229,"00:14:33,244","00:14:34,963","as his mother, Nelle,"
230,"00:14:35,084","00:14:39,204","pushed him to read poetry and
Bible verses at their church."

can be God's people"

239,"00:14:57,323","00:14:59,844","How did you memorize
those verses so fast?"
240,"00:14:59,923","00:15:01,924","I don't know.
I just read it and remembered."
241,"00:15:02,604","00:15:05,124","It's a gift, Dutch.
You have to look for those talents"
242,"00:15:05,204","00:15:07,164","because God has a purpose
for your life."
243,"00:15:07,244","00:15:08,723",Something only you can do.

what I was really looking for,"

298,"00:18:20,124","00:18:21,644","- ...over those summers...
- Help!"

- Help!"
300,"00:18:24,563","00:18:26,523","Hold on, hold on.
I got you. I got you."
301,"00:18:26,643","00:18:29,164",...those were all legitimate.
302,"00:18:29,243","00:18:30,923","- You okay?
- Yeah."
303,"00:18:31,683","00:18:32,604",Yeah.
304,"00:18:34,763","00:18:35,884",Almost there.

that performing his duty"

result in praise."
308,"00:18:44,043","00:18:46,564","What the hell are you doing?
I was fine."
309,"00:18:46,643","00:18:48,524","You trying to make me

Bring it all in."

- Fellas, I got tough news."
316,"00:19:11,203","00:19:15,163","...he was bringing people
together and solving problems."
317,"00:19:16,604","00:19:18,443","- Hey, Coach!
- Next week, right?"
318,"00:19:18,524","00:19:19,924",Coach.
319,"00:19:20,003","00:19:21,643","How come Sal and Palmer
aren't traveling with us?"
320,"00:19:21,724","00:19:23,644","- They're colored.
- I can see that. Thanks, Coach."
321,"00:19:23,723","00:19:25,804",Hotel wouldn't take 'em.
322,"00:19:29,483","00:19:32,043","Come on in, boys.
Welcome to Hotel Reagan."
323,"00:19:32,124","00:19:34,283","There's a room
upstairs for you, boys."
324,"00:19:34,363","00:19:35,804","I hope you don't mind
sharing with Dutch."
325,"00:19:35,883","00:19:37,683",His brother says he snores.
326,"00:19:37,764","00:19:39,723","That there is the Reagan

329,"00:19:44,003","00:19:45,923","I knew you'd come through, Jack."
330,"00:19:48,283","00:19:51,083","It's 8:00 p.m., I'm Dutch Reagan.
Here now the news."
331,"00:19:51,163","00:19:53,043","The new German Chancellor,
Adolf Hitler,"
332,"00:19:53,124","00:19:55,403","declares that his intentions
in rebuilding Germany"
333,"00:19:55,483","00:19:58,483","are peaceful and will comply with
all international agreements."
334,"00:19:58,604","00:20:01,324","- And it was radio...
- Yeah, sure they are."
335,"00:20:01,443","00:20:04,084","...through which
he began to show his skills."
336,"00:20:06,043","00:20:09,603","But I finally traced
his disdain for communism."
337,"00:20:09,684","00:20:11,204",It's hell on Earth.
338,"00:20:11,283","00:20:13,723","People are frightened,
hungry, divided."
339,"00:20:13,843","00:20:17,924","...back to when a dissident of
our country visited his church."
340,"00:20:18,003","00:20:21,683","State runs and controls
everything to the smallest detail."
341,"00:20:22,563","00:20:25,484","Your speech, your actions,
even your thoughts."
342,"00:20:26,323","00:20:29,444","You know what they took away
from us first thing?"
343,"00:20:29,523","00:20:30,443",God.
344,"00:20:31,163","00:20:32,363",Church like this.
345,"00:20:32,443","00:20:34,443","You will not find it
in the Soviet Union."
346,"00:20:34,524","00:20:36,044",They closed down most of them.
347,"00:20:36,123","00:20:39,763","And the clergy,
many are dead or disappeared."
348,"00:20:39,843","00:20:43,963","Americans should know more
about the communists"
349,"00:20:44,043","00:20:45,244",because it's coming here.
350,"00:20:46,003","00:20:50,523","Freedom is only one generation
away from extinction."
351,"00:20:54,243","00:20:56,923","And just like that,"
352,"00:20:58,443","00:21:00,123",the seed was planted.
353,"00:21:05,683","00:21:06,843","And remember,"
354,"00:21:06,923","00:21:09,163",loose lips sink ships.
355,"00:21:09,244","00:21:11,043",This is Ronald Reagan.
356,"00:21:11,123","00:21:12,804","So until next time,"
357,"00:21:12,883","00:21:14,444","so long,"
358,"00:21:14,523","00:21:16,683","- and God bless America.
- Cut."
359,"00:21:16,764","00:21:19,443","- That's a wrap on Reagan today.
- Excuse me?"
360,"00:21:19,524","00:21:22,043","Oh, Mr. Warner.
That's a wrap, everyone."
361,"00:21:23,364","00:21:24,923","Am I in trouble, boss?"
362,"00:21:25,004","00:21:27,363","Let's have a walk.
Congratulations."
363,"00:21:27,443","00:21:30,884","Vice president of Screen Actors Guild, huh?
I'm impressed."
364,"00:21:30,963","00:21:33,443","You know you stepped
into a hornet's nest, don't you?"
365,"00:21:33,523","00:21:35,284",How's that?
366,"00:21:36,124","00:21:39,404","There's about to be another war
right here in Hollywood,"
367,"00:21:39,483","00:21:41,923","with the commies on one side,
the mob on the other."
368,"00:21:42,643","00:21:44,443","And you're caught
right in the middle, son."
369,"00:21:44,523","00:21:46,283","Okay, Jack. Hey."
370,"00:21:46,363","00:21:48,563","Let's get one thing
straight, okay?"
371,"00:21:48,643","00:21:50,883","I'm not gonna do
any union busting for you"
372,"00:21:50,963","00:21:52,763","just because
I'm on your payroll."
373,"00:21:52,844","00:21:54,204","It's a conflict
of interest for me."
374,"00:21:54,283","00:21:56,643","It's not about
busting up the unions."
375,"00:21:56,723","00:21:58,083","But it's this new group,
this, uh..."
376,"00:21:58,163","00:22:00,283","Yeah, the Conference
for the Studio of Unions."
377,"00:22:00,363","00:22:02,003","Herb Sorrell, he's a commie."
378,"00:22:02,083","00:22:05,044","- Yeah.
- They're not just talking strike."
379,"00:22:05,123","00:22:07,883","They're talking about
taking over all the unions."
380,"00:22:07,963","00:22:11,923","Well, if it's a turf war,
just let them work it out. That's all."
381,"00:22:12,003","00:22:13,883","They're not gonna work it out,
they're gonna fight it out,"
382,"00:22:13,964","00:22:15,563",and that's where you come in.
383,"00:22:15,643","00:22:17,283","The actors
are the biggest union."
384,"00:22:17,363","00:22:19,324","If they go to Sorrell,
I'm telling you right now,"
385,"00:22:19,403","00:22:20,763",the commies win.
386,"00:22:20,843","00:22:22,923","- That ain't happening here.
- Well, look,"
387,"00:22:23,003","00:22:25,443","I don't feel comfortable getting
into the middle of something."
388,"00:22:25,523","00:22:27,483","Do you think you're gonna be
a leading man forever?"
389,"00:22:27,563","00:22:29,763","You need to face the facts, son."
390,"00:22:29,843","00:22:32,884","This war took the best years
of your life."
391,"00:22:32,963","00:22:36,443","You got, what, five years
of smiling for the camera"
392,"00:22:36,523","00:22:38,163","until they put you out
to pasture?"
393,"00:22:38,244","00:22:40,603","- Well, thanks for the pep talk, Jack.
- Or..."
394,"00:22:42,843","00:22:44,284",do you make a difference?
395,"00:22:47,083","00:22:48,403",A real difference.
396,"00:23:09,244","00:23:12,203",The movies are a platform.
397,"00:23:12,283","00:23:16,364","That we, as actors, are proud
and privileged to be a part of."
398,"00:23:17,163","00:23:21,403","We are the face and the
lifeblood of American movies."
399,"00:23:21,483","00:23:23,763",And so we must be vigilant
400,"00:23:23,843","00:23:25,803","and make ourselves
aware of others"
401,"00:23:25,883","00:23:27,963","that may seek to use
our platform"
402,"00:23:28,043","00:23:31,324","to use us
for their own purposes."
403,"00:23:35,323","00:23:38,003","♪ Of all the boys I've known,
and I've known some ♪"
404,"00:23:38,123","00:23:41,003","♪ Until I first met you,
I was lonesome ♪"
405,"00:23:41,123","00:23:44,203","♪ And when you came in sight,

my brain... ♪"
410,"00:23:54,723","00:23:56,443",Was it something I said?
411,"00:23:56,523","00:23:59,563",I'm just curious.
412,"00:23:59,643","00:24:02,083","Are you an actor
or a politician?"
413,"00:24:02,163","00:24:05,203","Jane, not here.
Not now. Please."
414,"00:24:05,283","00:24:08,563","If you put as much work
into your career"
415,"00:24:08,643","00:24:10,523","as you do making your speeches,"
416,"00:24:10,603","00:24:12,363",you'd have an Oscar by now.
417,"00:24:12,443","00:24:14,003",Jane...
418,"00:24:14,083","00:24:16,563","This is SAG.
This is our union."
419,"00:24:16,643","00:24:18,763","And being Vice President
of the Screen Actors Guild"
420,"00:24:18,843","00:24:21,403","is like a gift from God.
I really feel"
421,"00:24:21,483","00:24:23,603","like I can do something
that matters here."
422,"00:24:24,563","00:24:28,603","Is there anything worse
than an actor with a cause?"
423,"00:24:29,563","00:24:32,603","Kill your career
if you must, Ronnie,"
424,"00:24:32,683","00:24:34,923","but spare me
your damn speeches."
425,"00:24:36,283","00:24:38,083",You are an actor.
426,"00:24:38,163","00:24:39,963","- That is your job.
- Jane, just don't."
427,"00:24:40,043","00:24:41,603","- Not politics!
- Please don't."
428,"00:25:16,443","00:25:18,203","- No.
- What do you mean ""no""?"
429,"00:25:18,283","00:25:20,083","Higher wages,
better working conditions."
430,"00:25:20,163","00:25:22,403","That's what we all want.
That's what we're all going for."
431,"00:25:22,483","00:25:23,963",And you wanna shut it all down?
432,"00:25:24,963","00:25:26,643",What is it that you really want?
433,"00:25:26,723","00:25:29,003","One union, and united."
434,"00:25:29,083","00:25:30,923","Look, you don't wanna go
to war with us, Reagan."
435,"00:25:33,923","00:25:35,683",But what nobody knew
436,"00:25:35,803","00:25:39,043","was that Reagan
was an FBI informant."
437,"00:25:39,163","00:25:40,803","His codename T-10,"
438,"00:25:41,723","00:25:45,843","and he was exposing our
growing influence in Hollywood."
439,"00:25:45,963","00:25:47,443","Mr. Warner,
can you provide the name"
440,"00:25:47,523","00:25:49,123","of the leader
of the organization"
441,"00:25:49,203","00:25:50,923","attempting to infiltrate
your studio?"
442,"00:25:52,683","00:25:53,843",His name is Sorrell.
443,"00:25:55,603","00:25:57,083",Herb Sorrell.
444,"00:25:57,163","00:25:58,483","We're not joining you, Herb."
445,"00:26:07,323","00:26:09,203",Put it down. It's okay.
446,"00:26:09,283","00:26:10,923",Settle down. Settle down.
447,"00:26:11,003","00:26:12,283","You don't get it, do you?"
448,"00:26:12,363","00:26:13,363",We own this town.
449,"00:26:13,443","00:26:14,763",You don't own me.
450,"00:26:14,843","00:26:16,923",You don't own them.
451,"00:26:17,003","00:26:19,163","You wanna take a vote
right now? Go ahead."
452,"00:26:19,243","00:26:22,043","Let's put it to a vote!
See what happens."
453,"00:26:22,123","00:26:23,563",See what happens.
454,"00:26:37,403","00:26:39,843","Mr. Hayden,
in your opinion,"
455,"00:26:39,963","00:26:43,403","why weren't the communist's
efforts successful?"
456,"00:26:44,443","00:26:46,843","There was just
one problem."
457,"00:26:46,923","00:26:50,043","They ran into the Board of Directors
of the Screen Actors Guild,"
458,"00:26:50,123","00:26:51,843","in particular, Ronald Reagan..."
459,"00:26:53,283","00:26:55,323","who was a one-man battalion
against this thing."
460,"00:26:55,403","00:26:56,643",Let's go to work.
461,"00:26:56,723","00:26:57,923",Yeah!
462,"00:27:00,123","00:27:02,283","As a citizen,
I would not like to see"
463,"00:27:02,363","00:27:04,243",any political party outlawed
464,"00:27:04,323","00:27:06,483",on the basis of its ideology.
465,"00:27:06,563","00:27:09,163","Democracy is strong enough
to stand up for itself"
466,"00:27:09,243","00:27:11,363","against the inroads
of any ideology,"
467,"00:27:11,442","00:27:13,642","no matter how much
we may disagree with it."
468,"00:27:13,723","00:27:15,723","Because I still believe,
Mr. Chairman,"
469,"00:27:15,803","00:27:17,723",that democracy can handle it.
470,"00:27:19,563","00:27:22,883","He had shut us down.
He was clever in his message"
471,"00:27:23,003","00:27:25,803","that it was okay
to be communist,"
472,"00:27:25,923","00:27:29,002",but not while being paid by us.
473,"00:27:37,443","00:27:39,483","And cut! That's lunch,
everybody."
474,"00:27:39,562","00:27:41,123","- Okay. Nice work.
- You were great too."
475,"00:27:41,202","00:27:43,003","- Can I buy you lunch?
- Sure. I have time."
476,"00:27:43,083","00:27:45,602","- Let's grab a bite.
- Honey..."
477,"00:27:45,723","00:27:48,202","While his wife's career
was skyrocketing..."
478,"00:27:48,283","00:27:49,683","- ...commissary or my dress...
- Mama!"
479,"00:27:49,803","00:27:51,643","...he was reduced
to the sidelines"
480,"00:27:51,762","00:27:53,803",and their marriage...
481,"00:27:53,843","00:27:56,043","- deteriorated.
- Mama..."
482,"00:27:59,083","00:28:02,083","And to break more
his damaged heart,"
483,"00:28:02,203","00:28:04,483","their third child, Christine,"
484,"00:28:04,603","00:28:06,963",died the very day she was born.
485,"00:28:24,243","00:28:25,443",How's my son?
486,"00:28:28,122","00:28:29,482",I lost a child...
487,"00:28:30,923","00:28:33,163","marriage, a career."
488,"00:28:33,243","00:28:34,803",How do you think your boy is?
489,"00:28:36,723","00:28:38,283","You know, Nelle,"
490,"00:28:38,363","00:28:40,443","I think I kinda missed the boat
on that whole purpose thing."
491,"00:28:42,083","00:28:45,243","Maybe I'm just Jack
all over again."
492,"00:28:45,323","00:28:46,482","No, Dutch."
493,"00:28:46,563","00:28:48,043",You're not your father.
494,"00:28:50,843","00:28:52,563",Just remember
495,"00:28:52,643","00:28:57,322","to listen to that small,
soft voice,"
496,"00:28:57,403","00:28:59,802",the one that you can't hear
497,"00:29:01,042","00:29:03,362",unless you're alone
498,"00:29:04,403","00:29:06,123","and quiet,"
499,"00:29:06,203","00:29:08,523",and he has your full attention.
500,"00:29:10,923","00:29:12,883",Remember whose you are
501,"00:29:14,882","00:29:16,122",and whom you serve.
502,"00:29:27,443","00:29:28,563","Yes, Sandy?"
503,"00:29:30,283","00:29:31,563","Can you give an actress
five minutes?"
504,"00:29:31,643","00:29:33,203",Uh...
505,"00:29:33,283","00:29:36,043","- Of course.
- Miss Davis?"
506,"00:29:36,123","00:29:38,043","Hello.
I'm Nancy Davis."
507,"00:29:38,123","00:29:39,603","Hello, Nancy Davis.
I'm Ron Reagan."
508,"00:29:39,683","00:29:41,043","Yes, I know."
509,"00:29:41,963","00:29:43,803","- How about a cup of coffee?
- Oh, sure."
510,"00:29:43,883","00:29:46,243","- Have a seat.
- Ah."
511,"00:29:46,323","00:29:48,563","I'm afraid I've been a pest
to your secretary."
512,"00:29:48,643","00:29:51,403","- Oh.
- But I persist when it's important."
513,"00:29:51,483","00:29:53,323","- Cream, sugar?
- Oh, well,"
514,"00:29:53,403","00:29:55,043","- sure, uh, black.
- Oh!"
515,"00:29:57,203","00:30:00,682","Well... how can I help you,
Nancy Davis?"
516,"00:30:01,403","00:30:02,363","Well,"
517,"00:30:03,043","00:30:05,963","I'm listed as a signer
on a letter of support"
518,"00:30:06,042","00:30:08,123",for two communist sympathizers
519,"00:30:08,203","00:30:10,403","but I never signed
any such letter."
520,"00:30:10,483","00:30:11,963",There's another Nancy Davis.
521,"00:30:12,043","00:30:13,722","Oh, I see."
522,"00:30:13,803","00:30:16,602","Well, uh, the easiest thing
to do, is just change your name."
523,"00:30:16,683","00:30:18,203","It happens all the time
in Hollywood."
524,"00:30:18,283","00:30:20,803","Oh, no. No.
I cannot do that, no."
525,"00:30:21,763","00:30:23,643",My name is very important to me.
526,"00:30:23,722","00:30:24,923",It's-it's my family.
527,"00:30:25,003","00:30:26,482","Oh, of course."
528,"00:30:26,563","00:30:28,643","Uh, family's important."
529,"00:30:28,723","00:30:29,762",Yes.
530,"00:30:30,403","00:30:31,443",Very important.
531,"00:30:34,282","00:30:36,523","So, uh, I guess there's
only one thing left to do,"
532,"00:30:36,603","00:30:40,523","and that is to launch an exhaustive
and a detailed investigation."
533,"00:30:40,602","00:30:42,563","Well, of course,
I've retained an attorney."
534,"00:30:42,642","00:30:43,923","Oh, there won't be
any need for that."
535,"00:30:44,003","00:30:45,522","We can knock this out
over dinner."
536,"00:30:45,603","00:30:48,123","- Excuse me?
- Yes, uh, we can discuss it then."
537,"00:30:48,203","00:30:50,482","But I can't be late. I, uh..."
538,"00:30:50,563","00:30:53,043","Yes, I have an early studio call
tomorrow morning."
539,"00:30:53,123","00:30:56,443","Oh, well, I'll have to check
my date book."
540,"00:30:56,522","00:30:59,283","I'm just gonna--
Just give me..."
541,"00:30:59,363","00:31:00,243",Yes?
542,"00:31:00,323","00:31:02,243",Yes. Um...
543,"00:31:04,403","00:31:07,362","Well... Oh, I think
I can manage it,"
544,"00:31:07,443","00:31:08,883",but I have an early call too.
545,"00:31:08,963","00:31:10,482","Well, then it's a date!"
546,"00:31:10,563","00:31:11,923","- Yeah. Yes.
- Yeah."
547,"00:31:12,002","00:31:13,083","- Okay.
- Thank you."
548,"00:31:14,843","00:31:16,723","- Pleasure.
- Goodbye, for now."
549,"00:31:21,003","00:31:22,483","Bye, Miss Davis."
550,"00:31:26,962","00:31:28,523","Okay, Bobby, thanks."
551,"00:31:28,602","00:31:30,203","I'm gonna take care of that
in the morning."
552,"00:31:40,603","00:31:41,843","- Well...
- Well, it looks like"
553,"00:31:41,922","00:31:43,162",we've shut the place down.
554,"00:31:43,243","00:31:45,003","Huh, yes, we did. Here."
555,"00:31:51,522","00:31:52,602",Oh...
556,"00:31:53,483","00:31:55,642","Thank you, Joseph. Uh..."
557,"00:31:55,723","00:31:57,363","- Miss Davis?
- Yes?"
558,"00:31:57,443","00:31:59,163","I'm gonna get on this
first thing in the morning"
559,"00:31:59,243","00:32:00,842","and I'll make
all the calls myself."
560,"00:32:00,923","00:32:03,523",Your name will be off that list.
561,"00:32:03,602","00:32:04,682","Oh, just like that?"
562,"00:32:04,763","00:32:06,322",Just like that.
563,"00:32:06,403","00:32:07,923","So, um,"
564,"00:32:08,003","00:32:11,843","when-when you're not acting
or being SAG president,"
565,"00:32:11,922","00:32:14,802","what-what do you like to do
with your time, Mr. Reagan?"
566,"00:32:14,883","00:32:17,523","Well, I... I like the outdoors."
567,"00:32:17,603","00:32:18,723",Mm-hmm.
568,"00:32:18,802","00:32:20,602","- I-I play golf.
- Mm."
569,"00:32:20,683","00:32:21,603",And...
570,"00:32:22,362","00:32:24,483",I-I love riding horses.
571,"00:32:24,562","00:32:25,922",Yes. Do you ride?
572,"00:32:26,642","00:32:28,443","- Sure, I do. Mm-hmm.
- You do?"
573,"00:32:28,522","00:32:31,483","Well, there's nothing like a
relationship with a horse, is there?"
574,"00:32:31,562","00:32:33,563",They're beautiful animals.
575,"00:32:33,642","00:32:34,602","- Yeah.
- Mm-hmm."
576,"00:32:35,522","00:32:37,722",Ooh! Ooh!
577,"00:32:37,803","00:32:38,962","Look, just..."
578,"00:32:39,043","00:32:40,523","- How do I slow down?
- Well, just..."
579,"00:32:40,602","00:32:42,563","- Ooh! Okay.
- You're doing fine. You're doing fine."
580,"00:32:44,042","00:32:46,362",Oh! Oh!
581,"00:32:47,442","00:32:49,402","- You look good on a horse.
- Oh, thank you."
582,"00:32:50,963","00:32:52,402","I have
a confession to make."
583,"00:32:52,483","00:32:53,482","Oh, what's that?"
584,"00:32:53,563","00:32:55,402",I don't ride horses.
585,"00:32:55,483","00:32:59,122","- Really? You could have fooled me.
- Oh!"
586,"00:32:59,203","00:33:01,123","Well, it's beautiful up here."
587,"00:33:01,202","00:33:02,802",Come on over here.
588,"00:33:02,883","00:33:06,002","- Yes, it is.
- It's like we're a million miles from LA."
589,"00:33:06,083","00:33:09,083","Yes. You know, I did my first
location shoot here in fact."
590,"00:33:09,162","00:33:10,883","- Really?
- Yes."
591,"00:33:10,963","00:33:12,682","I jumped on the back
of that horse,"
592,"00:33:12,763","00:33:16,083","looked around at all this,
and said, ""Wow, I'm in heaven."""
593,"00:33:16,162","00:33:17,482",Oh!
594,"00:33:17,563","00:33:19,162","Yeah, it's heaven."
595,"00:33:20,763","00:33:24,202","You know, I have a confession
to make of my own, Nancy."
596,"00:33:24,283","00:33:26,162",Mmm.
597,"00:33:26,243","00:33:27,483",Uh...
598,"00:33:27,563","00:33:29,883","I'm what you call
""damaged goods."""
599,"00:33:29,962","00:33:32,283","I'm divorced, I got kids."
600,"00:33:32,363","00:33:34,323","I haven't had
a decent role in years"
601,"00:33:35,362","00:33:36,603",and I'm just about broke.
602,"00:33:37,843","00:33:39,162",How's that for a come-on?
603,"00:33:41,563","00:33:43,322","We're all damaged goods, Ronnie."
604,"00:33:46,683","00:33:48,843",What's next for you? I mean...
605,"00:33:50,243","00:33:51,762","what do you want
out of this life?"
606,"00:33:53,042","00:33:55,482","I don't know,
I used to have big ambitions."
607,"00:33:55,563","00:33:56,523",Dreams.
608,"00:33:57,842","00:33:58,802","Now, I..."
609,"00:33:59,563","00:34:02,283","I don't know. I just wanna do
something good in this world."
610,"00:34:03,602","00:34:05,043",Make a difference.
611,"00:34:06,162","00:34:07,883",I think you've done that.
612,"00:34:09,403","00:34:11,122","I'd like to make
a difference too."
613,"00:34:14,323","00:34:17,042","But I have figured
something out, Ronnie."
614,"00:34:18,163","00:34:19,642","- What's that?
- It's really hard"
615,"00:34:19,723","00:34:21,522","to make a difference
in this life"
616,"00:34:23,322","00:34:24,763",when you have to do it alone.
617,"00:34:47,283","00:34:48,203",Mmm.
618,"00:35:08,322","00:35:10,082",Are you sure you wanna go?
619,"00:35:10,163","00:35:12,562","You know, this is not exactly
Academy Award stuff."
620,"00:35:12,643","00:35:14,403","Well, you know
we don't like to be apart,"
621,"00:35:14,482","00:35:16,323","and I love to watch
my husband work."
622,"00:35:16,402","00:35:18,403","I know, I know, work's work."
623,"00:35:20,682","00:35:22,363","Bye, Patti!"
624,"00:35:39,803","00:35:42,123","Mr. Reagan,
your agent's on the line."
625,"00:35:42,202","00:35:45,202","Look, Lou, if I go out there,
my career, it's..."
626,"00:35:46,282","00:35:47,282",it's dead.
627,"00:35:50,842","00:35:52,403","Lou, listen to me."
628,"00:35:53,762","00:35:56,442",I'm not going out there.
629,"00:35:56,523","00:35:59,362",It is Pabst Blue Ribbon time!
630,"00:36:00,243","00:36:03,362","- What'll you have?
- I'll have a Pabst Blue Ribbon!"
631,"00:36:03,442","00:36:06,082","- I'll take a Pabst, Bonzo!
- Oh, yeah."
632,"00:36:07,923","00:36:10,243","Looks like it's bedtime
for Bonzo, folks!"
633,"00:36:10,322","00:36:12,962","Thank you,
ladies and gentlemen,"
634,"00:36:13,042","00:36:15,762","and now the Pabst Blue
Ribbon dancers!"
635,"00:36:23,082","00:36:24,363",Mm.
636,"00:36:33,963","00:36:35,402",Ladies...
637,"00:36:35,483","00:36:37,563","do you happen to have
an extra smoke"
638,"00:36:37,642","00:36:39,443",for a clown? Thank you.
639,"00:36:49,603","00:36:51,082","- Thanks.
- No problem."
640,"00:37:30,363","00:37:33,882","This season, I'm sending
all my friends Chesterfields."
641,"00:37:34,002","00:37:37,083","Meanwhile,
his career as movie star"
642,"00:37:37,203","00:37:38,682",continued to fade.
643,"00:37:38,762","00:37:40,842",Wow! I could've had a V8!
644,"00:37:41,762","00:37:43,122","Oh, Ronnie!"
645,"00:37:43,202","00:37:44,962",That's a super smooth shave.
646,"00:37:45,042","00:37:46,842",That's because I used Gillette.
647,"00:37:48,122","00:37:51,483","Soothe your skin with
Campho-Phenique antiseptic powder."
648,"00:37:51,562","00:37:55,362","At the movies or at home, honey,
they're the perfect snack."
649,"00:37:55,443","00:37:57,802",ICEE. The coldest drink in town
650,"00:37:57,882","00:37:59,802","...at a sweet, low price."
651,"00:37:59,882","00:38:02,002","Come on, Colman's.
Light my fire."
652,"00:38:05,082","00:38:09,522","He continued to focus on his role as
the president of Screen Actors Guild"
653,"00:38:10,803","00:38:12,962","where he did quite well,
actually."
654,"00:38:13,042","00:38:16,882","But the movie opportunities
started to evaporate."
655,"00:38:16,963","00:38:19,282","Yes, he was a B-movie star.
This is well-known."
656,"00:38:20,242","00:38:23,682","But what does this have to do
with losing our Motherland?"
657,"00:38:25,203","00:38:27,322",Communism is not the Motherland.
658,"00:38:28,522","00:38:30,283",They're the Motherland.
659,"00:38:31,322","00:38:35,402","Turgenev, Leo Tolstoy, Chekhov."
660,"00:38:35,483","00:38:37,802","That's the Motherland!
The Motherland..."
661,"00:38:39,402","00:38:40,362",is here!
662,"00:38:43,882","00:38:45,842",I can't. I must be...
663,"00:38:55,282","00:38:56,203",Hello?
664,"00:38:57,762","00:38:58,722","Oh, no."
665,"00:38:59,562","00:39:00,482",Ronnie?
666,"00:39:06,322","00:39:08,082","Thank you, Lord, for my mother."
667,"00:39:10,242","00:39:11,482",Take care of her.
668,"00:39:12,762","00:39:14,122",I know you will.
669,"00:39:17,002","00:39:19,923","Your good and faithful servant
has come home."
670,"00:39:28,522","00:39:31,043","While he mourned
the loss of his mother,"
671,"00:39:31,162","00:39:34,162","and continued to struggle
with his career,"
672,"00:39:34,282","00:39:37,002",the world was passing him by.
673,"00:39:37,042","00:39:38,723","The United States
and Soviet Union"
674,"00:39:38,842","00:39:40,202",now face off in a new Cold War.
675,"00:39:40,322","00:39:42,002",Nuclear retaliation looms.
676,"00:39:42,082","00:39:44,282","""The purpose of these bases"
677,"00:39:44,362","00:39:48,882","can be none other than to provide
a nuclear strike capability"
678,"00:39:48,962","00:39:50,562","against the western hemisphere."""
679,"00:39:50,682","00:39:52,202",President Kennedy's blockade
680,"00:39:52,322","00:39:55,562","stops the advance
of nuclear weapons into Cuba."
681,"00:39:58,722","00:40:00,602","Movements across
Germany had stopped"
682,"00:40:00,722","00:40:02,282","as the East Germans
built a wall overnight,"
683,"00:40:02,402","00:40:04,082","separating not only
the country,"
684,"00:40:04,202","00:40:05,323",but neighbors and family.
685,"00:40:10,522","00:40:15,082","He became host of TV show
for appliance company."
686,"00:40:15,203","00:40:18,202","He toured across the country,
meeting factory workers"
687,"00:40:18,322","00:40:19,642",and giving speeches.
688,"00:40:19,762","00:40:22,362","He was like politician
with no party."
689,"00:40:23,282","00:40:26,802","So, he decided to set
his sights on something else."
690,"00:40:26,922","00:40:32,242","Us. He devoured books
about communism, espionage,"
691,"00:40:32,362","00:40:34,282","our takeover of Eastern Europe,"
692,"00:40:34,403","00:40:36,562","and the construction
of the Berlin Wall."
693,"00:40:40,082","00:40:42,562","You know our bed's
a lot more comfortable."
694,"00:40:42,642","00:40:45,962","Well, unless you prefer, uh,
Whittaker Chambers to me?"
695,"00:40:46,042","00:40:48,202","Oh, you know that's not true."
696,"00:40:48,282","00:40:50,362","Come to bed, honey. It's late."
697,"00:40:54,563","00:40:58,842","You know, all they have
are missiles and oil."
698,"00:40:59,842","00:41:02,162","If we get them to spend money
they don't have,"
699,"00:41:02,242","00:41:03,602",they can't support themselves.
700,"00:41:03,682","00:41:05,562","- The Soviets.
- The Soviets."
701,"00:41:05,642","00:41:07,442","We've been going
about this all wrong."
702,"00:41:07,522","00:41:10,042","We don't have to match them
missile for missile."
703,"00:41:10,802","00:41:12,642",All we have to do
704,"00:41:12,722","00:41:14,802",is just keep up the pressure.
705,"00:41:14,882","00:41:17,162","We have deeper pockets
than they do."
706,"00:41:17,242","00:41:20,042","And here I thought
I married an actor."
707,"00:41:21,202","00:41:23,842","Well, you could always talk
to Dick Nixon,"
708,"00:41:23,922","00:41:27,483","President Kennedy, or any
of your political friends."
709,"00:41:29,122","00:41:31,842","But why is it that my husband
seems to know"
710,"00:41:31,922","00:41:34,642","what's gonna happen
before they do, hmm?"
711,"00:41:36,402","00:41:38,562","- Well...
- Yeah."
712,"00:41:38,642","00:41:42,122","I was a lifeguard at a public
swimming hole on a river."
713,"00:41:43,042","00:41:44,842",And I studied that river.
714,"00:41:45,602","00:41:48,682","And I learned
how to read the currents."
715,"00:41:50,242","00:41:52,122","Not just the ones
on the surface."
716,"00:41:53,322","00:41:56,282","But also the ones that were
deep underneath the water,"
717,"00:41:57,122","00:41:59,042",flowing way under.
718,"00:42:01,562","00:42:03,002",And I got good at it.
719,"00:42:13,362","00:42:15,602","I knew people were in trouble
before they did."
720,"00:42:26,242","00:42:29,362","Moon, thank you for bringing your
brother up here on such short notice."
721,"00:42:29,442","00:42:31,482","It wasn't easy,
he's not a fan of flying."
722,"00:42:31,562","00:42:34,122","Well, we'll remedy that.
Thank you for coming, Mr. Reagan."
723,"00:42:34,202","00:42:35,882","Thanks for having me,
Mr. Tuttle."
724,"00:42:35,962","00:42:38,082","Now, we understand
that you jumped the aisle"
725,"00:42:38,162","00:42:39,882","- and switched parties.
- Well,"
726,"00:42:39,962","00:42:43,162","my brother and I both,
we came of age under FDR."
727,"00:42:43,242","00:42:45,162","Our dad, Jack,
he was a huge fan,"
728,"00:42:45,242","00:42:48,642","and we were proud
to be New Deal Democrats."
729,"00:42:48,722","00:42:50,242",So why did you leave 'em?
730,"00:42:50,322","00:42:51,562",I didn't.
731,"00:42:51,642","00:42:53,562",They left me.
732,"00:42:53,642","00:42:55,642","Well, how do you feel about
campaigning for Goldwater?"
733,"00:42:55,722","00:42:57,082","He's gonna get shellacked
in November."
734,"00:42:57,162","00:42:59,122",No way he takes the White House.
735,"00:42:59,202","00:43:02,402","Mr. Tuttle's right,
he can't beat LBJ."
736,"00:43:02,482","00:43:04,242","I'm curious, Ron."
737,"00:43:04,322","00:43:06,482","What would you say
is the issue of our time?"
738,"00:43:07,802","00:43:09,682",No question about it.
739,"00:43:09,762","00:43:11,762",Communism and the Soviet Union.
740,"00:43:11,842","00:43:14,882","Domestic issues
is what I'm more curious about."
741,"00:43:16,922","00:43:20,722","What's more domestic
than survival, Mr. Tuttle?"
742,"00:43:20,802","00:43:23,642","Communism is the natural enemy
of freedom."
743,"00:43:23,722","00:43:27,202","It won't stop attacking us
from the outside or the inside."
744,"00:43:27,282","00:43:29,842","And it's spreading around the
world while we wring our hands"
745,"00:43:29,922","00:43:31,442",trying to negotiate.
746,"00:43:35,282","00:43:38,162","What did I tell you, guys?
He's not just a pretty face."
747,"00:43:38,242","00:43:40,442","Why don't you put your money
where your mouth is, Ron?"
748,"00:43:40,522","00:43:44,081","Get in the game.
Support Goldwater and then run for office."
749,"00:43:44,162","00:43:45,802","Well, he'd win State Senator
in a landslide."
750,"00:43:45,882","00:43:47,762","State Senator.
How does that sound?"
751,"00:43:50,642","00:43:51,562","Well,"
752,"00:43:52,522","00:43:53,961",I played a senator once.
753,"00:43:56,042","00:43:57,682","But I've never played
a governor."
754,"00:44:04,082","00:44:08,042","Seventeen years after
I had begun following him,"
755,"00:44:08,162","00:44:11,842","he made his debut
on American political stage."
756,"00:44:11,962","00:44:15,081","Well, I'd like to suggest to you,
there is no such thing as left or right."
757,"00:44:15,202","00:44:17,202",There's only up or down.
758,"00:44:17,322","00:44:18,882","- Look, there's daddy.
- I believe that the issues"
759,"00:44:19,002","00:44:20,841","confronting us
cross party lines."
760,"00:44:20,962","00:44:22,842","Now, one side of this campaign"
761,"00:44:22,922","00:44:25,322","has been telling us
that the issues of this election"
762,"00:44:25,402","00:44:27,802","are the maintenance of peace
and prosperity."
763,"00:44:28,722","00:44:30,682",The line has been used.
764,"00:44:30,762","00:44:32,641","""We've never had it so good."""
765,"00:44:32,722","00:44:36,122","Somewhere, a perversion
has taken place."
766,"00:44:36,201","00:44:39,042","Should Moses have told
the children of Israel to live"
767,"00:44:39,122","00:44:40,682",in slavery under the pharaohs?
768,"00:44:40,762","00:44:42,722","Should Christ
have refused the cross?"
769,"00:44:42,802","00:44:44,642","Should the patriots
have thrown down their guns"
770,"00:44:44,722","00:44:47,362","and refused to fire the shot
heard around the world?"
771,"00:44:48,522","00:44:50,642",You and I have the courage
772,"00:44:50,722","00:44:52,882",to say to our enemies...
773,"00:44:53,002","00:44:55,282","there is a price
we will not pay."
774,"00:44:55,401","00:45:00,922","A point beyond which
they must not advance."
775,"00:45:01,042","00:45:03,522","We'll preserve
for our children this,"
776,"00:45:03,641","00:45:06,122","the last best hope
of man on Earth,"
777,"00:45:06,241","00:45:09,362","or we'll sentence them
to take the last step"
778,"00:45:09,482","00:45:11,962","into a thousand years
of darkness."
779,"00:45:12,522","00:45:15,322","When great forces
are on the move in the world,"
780,"00:45:15,402","00:45:20,442","we learn that we are spirits,
not animals."
781,"00:45:20,522","00:45:23,322","There's something going on
in time and space,"
782,"00:45:23,402","00:45:25,202","beyond time and space,"
783,"00:45:25,282","00:45:27,081","which, whether
we like it or not,"
784,"00:45:27,162","00:45:28,802",spells duty.
785,"00:45:29,561","00:45:30,521",You and I...
786,"00:45:31,762","00:45:33,922",have a rendezvous with destiny.
787,"00:45:38,282","00:45:41,761",Mr. Goldwater lost decisively.
788,"00:45:41,802","00:45:44,722",But The Crusader had arrived.
789,"00:45:44,842","00:45:49,562","And he was putting us on notice that
he was not afraid to take us on."
790,"00:45:59,041","00:46:00,001","- Hello.
- Hello."
791,"00:46:00,082","00:46:02,002","Oh, hi! It's you!"
792,"00:46:02,082","00:46:04,682","- Well, yes.
- What are doing you here?"
793,"00:46:04,762","00:46:06,282",I-- Did I win something?
794,"00:46:06,362","00:46:08,602","No. We're canvasing
the neighborhood,"
795,"00:46:08,682","00:46:11,482","and I'm running for governor
and I would like your vote."
796,"00:46:11,562","00:46:14,362","Well, of course! Of course! I..."
797,"00:46:14,961","00:46:17,322","Now I'm embarrassed.
I forgot your name."
798,"00:46:17,402","00:46:20,202",Do his initials help? RR?
799,"00:46:22,162","00:46:25,641",Honey! Roy Rogers is here!
800,"00:46:27,522","00:46:29,761",And he's running for governor!
801,"00:46:44,682","00:46:48,242","He was
on the US stage now."
802,"00:46:48,281","00:46:51,522","But my colleagues still refused
to take him seriously."
803,"00:46:52,322","00:46:54,562","After all, they said,"
804,"00:46:54,601","00:46:56,762","""What could state governor
do to us?"""
805,"00:46:56,842","00:46:59,642",Reagan! Reagan!
806,"00:47:02,202","00:47:04,762","The police are overburdened.
There's just too many of them."
807,"00:47:04,842","00:47:06,482",Where are these kids' parents?
808,"00:47:06,562","00:47:08,561","Well, they're not all students.
Mostly agitators."
809,"00:47:08,642","00:47:10,122","They don't even know
what they're protesting."
810,"00:47:10,202","00:47:11,842","They're just doing it to do it,"
811,"00:47:11,922","00:47:13,282","and they're getting
outside help."
812,"00:47:13,361","00:47:14,682","They've issued
a new set of demands."
813,"00:47:14,761","00:47:16,241",Of course they have.
814,"00:47:16,322","00:47:18,522","They want you to present them
to them personally."
815,"00:47:19,442","00:47:22,122","- The National Guard...
- is on standby."
816,"00:47:22,202","00:47:23,762","They can be on-site
within an hour."
817,"00:47:23,842","00:47:26,362","That's going federal.
Ramifications for that."
818,"00:47:26,442","00:47:29,362","Communities, schools,
especially the press."
819,"00:47:30,562","00:47:31,922","If they wanna talk,"
820,"00:47:33,281","00:47:34,602",let's go talk.
821,"00:47:45,842","00:47:47,001",Love rules!
822,"00:47:47,082","00:47:50,162","Governor Reagan!
Make love, not war!"
823,"00:47:50,242","00:47:53,362","From the looks of him,
he can't do either right now."
824,"00:47:53,441","00:47:55,242",Bill's gonna meet us inside.
825,"00:47:56,402","00:47:57,362",Lead the way.
826,"00:47:58,162","00:48:00,441",Peace now! Peace now!
827,"00:48:00,522","00:48:03,522","We want to hear you speak openly
about this to the state of California!"
828,"00:48:03,602","00:48:05,481","Well, what do you think
I'm doing here?"
829,"00:48:05,562","00:48:08,521","If you would come out against the
police escalation, they might listen."
830,"00:48:08,602","00:48:12,002","When did you ever stand up
in front of your students"
831,"00:48:12,081","00:48:13,642",and beg them not to do this?
832,"00:48:13,721","00:48:17,202","They told you that they were
going to destroy the university"
833,"00:48:17,281","00:48:19,522","if you sought to go ahead
with this construction."
834,"00:48:19,601","00:48:22,521","- But they offered to negotiate!
- Negotiate what?"
835,"00:48:22,602","00:48:24,642","All of this happened, professor,
the very first time"
836,"00:48:24,721","00:48:26,562","that some of you who are
old enough to know better"
837,"00:48:26,641","00:48:29,962","let students think that
they have the right to choose"
838,"00:48:30,041","00:48:31,841","which laws they were gonna obey,"
839,"00:48:31,922","00:48:34,602","as long as it was done
in the name of social protest."
840,"00:48:34,682","00:48:36,241",I've had enough.
841,"00:48:37,802","00:48:40,282","I'm calling in
the National Guard."
842,"00:48:58,242","00:48:59,602",Shh!
843,"00:49:06,722","00:49:08,721","The protestors
pushed him hard,"
844,"00:49:08,802","00:49:10,402",but he pushed them harder.
845,"00:49:11,282","00:49:13,722","He was controversial governor,"
846,"00:49:13,801","00:49:15,642","but limited in what
he could accomplish."
847,"00:49:15,721","00:49:19,561","At least, as far as the things
he cared most about, like us."
848,"00:49:21,201","00:49:23,921","He enraged many sympathetic
to our cause,"
849,"00:49:24,002","00:49:26,722","but he also inspired
many fanatics"
850,"00:49:26,801","00:49:28,201",who would go to great lengths
851,"00:49:28,321","00:49:31,122",to get a glimpse of their hero.
852,"00:49:32,642","00:49:34,842","Ron, who's this?"
853,"00:49:35,682","00:49:36,961","Young man, uh..."
854,"00:49:37,801","00:49:38,881",why are you in my yard?
855,"00:49:40,362","00:49:41,722","Hey, Mrs. Gov!"
856,"00:49:41,801","00:49:43,841","I'm, uh, I'm Dana."
857,"00:49:43,922","00:49:45,962","I'm the head writer
for Youth for Reagan."
858,"00:49:46,041","00:49:47,921","And they're shutting us down.
I just want five minutes with the Gov."
859,"00:49:48,002","00:49:49,201","Oh, for heaven's sake."
860,"00:49:49,282","00:49:51,322","I-I'll be respectful,
scouts honor."
861,"00:49:51,401","00:49:53,681","I-I won't swear
or throw anything."
862,"00:49:53,762","00:49:56,161","- And I don't burn buildings.
- No, the problem is,"
863,"00:49:56,242","00:49:58,641","is that the governor
is on a very tight schedule"
864,"00:49:58,722","00:50:00,882","and he won't give you
five minutes."
865,"00:50:00,961","00:50:03,122","- He'll give you an hour.
- Sweet!"
866,"00:50:03,201","00:50:05,201","No, it's not sweet.
You need to go home."
867,"00:50:05,282","00:50:07,922","Please, just call the office and I'll
make sure you get an appointment, okay?"
868,"00:50:08,001","00:50:10,281","- Honey? Is everything all right?
- Hey, Gov!"
869,"00:50:10,362","00:50:12,722","These young people
spent the night in our yard."
870,"00:50:12,801","00:50:14,441","I just wanna talk.
Five minutes."
871,"00:50:17,601","00:50:19,601","You look tired.
How about a cup of coffee?"
872,"00:50:19,682","00:50:21,922","- Oh.
- Hell, yeah, dude!"
873,"00:50:23,321","00:50:25,641","Thank you. I'm sorry,
I mean, Governor."
874,"00:50:30,201","00:50:33,282","So the politician says,
""What did I do to deserve this?"""
875,"00:50:33,361","00:50:35,841","Saint Peter said, ""Well,
we didn't know what to do with you,"
876,"00:50:35,921","00:50:38,121","because you're the first
politician we've had up here."""
877,"00:50:40,201","00:50:42,561","Nelle had been gone
for a decade,"
878,"00:50:42,681","00:50:44,721","but The Crusader
managed to find others"
879,"00:50:44,841","00:50:47,321","who shared
her fundamentalist beliefs."
880,"00:50:47,441","00:50:49,801","And one evening,
our surveillance picked up"
881,"00:50:49,921","00:50:52,602","one of the strangest exchanges
I ever heard..."
882,"00:50:52,722","00:50:54,642","...involving a pop star,"
883,"00:50:54,761","00:50:56,322","a preacher,"
884,"00:50:57,002","00:50:58,601",and a prophecy.
885,"00:50:58,682","00:51:01,161","If you continue to walk
uprightly before me,"
886,"00:51:01,242","00:51:04,962","you will dwell
at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue."
887,"00:51:08,002","00:51:08,922",Amen.
888,"00:51:14,641","00:51:15,761","Well, that was something."
889,"00:51:17,921","00:51:19,882","All right, well,
we should probably head out."
890,"00:51:19,961","00:51:21,241","- Yes, yes.
- Thank you, Governor."
891,"00:51:21,321","00:51:23,281","- Thank you, Pat.
- Yeah, thanks for coming."
892,"00:51:23,362","00:51:24,521",Yes.
893,"00:51:26,602","00:51:28,282",You can't possibly believe this.
894,"00:51:29,961","00:51:32,321",Doesn't matter if I believe it.
895,"00:51:33,322","00:51:34,442",Did he believe it?
896,"00:51:35,402","00:51:36,362",Who knows?
897,"00:52:24,441","00:52:26,641","Well, Bill, there she is."
898,"00:52:27,841","00:52:29,921",688 acres in all.
899,"00:52:30,002","00:52:32,722","That sounds about enough.
How much they asking?"
900,"00:52:33,321","00:52:36,761","Too much
for an honest politician."
901,"00:52:36,842","00:52:40,002","Well, there's nothing like stomping
around on your own piece of dirt."
902,"00:52:40,081","00:52:41,122","Work and sweat,"
903,"00:52:41,201","00:52:42,762",think about your next move.

governor can do about The Soviets."
909,"00:52:56,841","00:52:59,161","Well, you got a point. Not much."
910,"00:53:00,961","00:53:02,121",But a president...

934,"00:54:29,641","00:54:31,522",But maybe he was onto something.
935,"00:54:33,241","00:54:35,362",You just may need to save us.
936,"00:54:40,801","00:54:42,721","Good evening.
Tonight's showdown"
937,"00:54:42,841","00:54:45,441","might be the most thrilling
convention we've ever seen."
938,"00:54:45,561","00:54:47,881","It's a true toss-up
between the incumbent president"
939,"00:54:48,001","00:54:51,241","and a serious challenger
from within his own party."
940,"00:54:51,321","00:54:53,281","- Dick thinks if he can talk to Drew--
- What?"
941,"00:54:53,361","00:54:56,361","Dick thinks that if he can talk to
Drew, Pennsylvania might go our way."
942,"00:54:56,441","00:54:59,082","Okay. I heard James Baker
had Pennsylvania on lock before."
943,"00:54:59,161","00:55:00,921","- He said they're in play.
- We lost Oregon."
944,"00:55:01,002","00:55:02,201","- Oregon?
- It's gone. All right?"
945,"00:55:02,281","00:55:04,321","Ohio, Indiana, Florida,
or Pennsylvania,"
946,"00:55:04,401","00:55:06,921","- they'll have to break our way.
-  Anyone else looking for a Ford hat? How about you?"
947,"00:55:07,001","00:55:09,481","I think you need to change
that hat. Here you go."
948,"00:55:09,561","00:55:11,282","Oh, that's gonna look good.
I'll get rid of this."
949,"00:55:11,361","00:55:13,202","Okay, we may need to rethink
that strategy."
950,"00:55:13,281","00:55:14,881","Indiana, Florida, Pennsylvania."
951,"00:55:14,961","00:55:17,281","I'll get Schweiker to connect
with Drew about Pennsylvania."
952,"00:55:17,361","00:55:19,441","- I'll circle back to Ohio.
- Okay. I will take Florida,"
953,"00:55:19,522","00:55:21,801","and, Mike, why don't you go
talk with Rich and Marilynn..."
954,"00:55:21,881","00:55:23,121","- Marilynn. Okay.
- ...about Indiana? Okay?"
955,"00:55:23,201","00:55:24,881","Hey, hey. We gotta win one
for the Gipper."
956,"00:55:24,961","00:55:26,761","- Huh?
- Come on!"
957,"00:55:26,841","00:55:29,361","- One, two, three! For the Gipper!
- Ready, go... What?"
958,"00:55:29,481","00:55:31,761","For the next
President of the United States,"
959,"00:55:31,881","00:55:36,321","California casts all 167
for Governor Ronald Reagan!"
960,"00:55:38,722","00:55:41,641","Thank you, California."
961,"00:55:41,761","00:55:44,561","The Commonwealth
of Pennsylvania"
962,"00:55:44,681","00:55:47,881",has 93 votes for Gerald Ford!
963,"00:55:49,562","00:55:53,601","The state of West Virginia
proudly presents its vote"
964,"00:55:53,721","00:55:57,881","on behalf of our party's
candidate for the presidency..."
965,"00:56:00,841","00:56:02,961","Twenty votes
for Gerald R. Ford."
966,"00:56:14,242","00:56:16,881","There is no defeat
more bitter"
967,"00:56:17,001","00:56:18,762","than a political defeat,"
968,"00:56:18,881","00:56:22,241","especially if you think
it is your last chance."
969,"00:56:22,361","00:56:24,201","And right now, I predict"
970,"00:56:24,321","00:56:27,441","that the American people
are going to say that night,"
971,"00:56:27,561","00:56:30,001","""Gerry, you've done a good job!"
972,"00:56:30,081","00:56:31,761","Keep right on doing it!"""
973,"00:56:33,121","00:56:34,961","Ford stole it, sir."
974,"00:56:35,041","00:56:36,481","He was handing out
ambassadorship"
975,"00:56:36,561","00:56:38,841","and rides on Air Force One
like candy to babies."
976,"00:56:38,922","00:56:41,161",Backstage politics.
977,"00:56:46,441","00:56:49,161","What I really wanted, Mike,
was to be the guy"
978,"00:56:49,281","00:56:51,962","who finally got to say ""nyet""
to the Soviets."
979,"00:56:56,601","00:56:58,161",Guess it wasn't God's will.
980,"00:57:00,761","00:57:02,841","Democrats
and Republicans"
981,"00:57:02,961","00:57:06,561","presented a united front
against us for 30 years."
982,"00:57:06,681","00:57:11,081","But we sensed an opportunity with
the election of Jimmy Carter."
983,"00:57:11,801","00:57:15,321","Then, in 1979,"
984,"00:57:15,441","00:57:18,721","my worst fears
began to take shape."
985,"00:57:18,842","00:57:21,921",It is a crisis of confidence.
986,"00:57:22,001","00:57:25,921","Yes, Jimmy, it's a crisis
of confidence, all right."
987,"00:57:27,401","00:57:28,921",Are you listening to this?
988,"00:57:29,041","00:57:31,201","We can see this crisis
drawing down..."
989,"00:57:31,281","00:57:34,202","We are the greatest country in the
world and we have just forgotten it."
990,"00:57:35,881","00:57:37,481",Like I didn't see this coming.
991,"00:57:39,521","00:57:40,801","It's okay to say it, Ronnie."
992,"00:57:43,241","00:57:44,801",Okay. I'll say it.
993,"00:57:46,481","00:57:47,881",I want to run again.
994,"00:57:59,041","00:58:00,841",What do you think about that?
995,"00:58:02,121","00:58:03,721",If I can do it all again...
996,"00:58:06,481","00:58:09,722","The public scrutiny,
the attacks on your character,"
997,"00:58:09,801","00:58:11,081",all the lies.
998,"00:58:13,681","00:58:14,881","But mainly,"
999,"00:58:15,921","00:58:17,402",I want you to be happy.
1000,"00:58:18,441","00:58:23,041","Well, you've already made me
the happiest man in the world."
1001,"00:58:28,961","00:58:31,801","I've had to share you
my whole life."
1002,"00:58:31,881","00:58:34,721","But... that's what
I signed up for,"
1003,"00:58:36,241","00:58:38,921","and who I fell in love with.
Hmm."
1004,"00:58:41,481","00:58:43,161","It's not over for you, Ronnie."
1005,"00:58:44,881","00:58:46,441",You know what you have to do.
1006,"00:58:47,801","00:58:49,401",And this time...
1007,"00:58:49,481","00:58:50,721","- Win it.
- Win it."
1008,"00:59:02,921","00:59:05,001","No, Mr. President,"
1009,"00:59:05,081","00:59:08,001","we don't have
double-digit inflation"
1010,"00:59:08,081","00:59:10,001","because the people
are living too well."
1011,"00:59:10,081","00:59:14,521","We have double-digit inflation because
the government is living too well."
1012,"00:59:15,521","00:59:19,441","Our first priority
must always be world peace."
1013,"00:59:20,281","00:59:23,601","The use of force
is always the last resort."
1014,"00:59:23,681","00:59:26,001","These are the kind of elements
of a national health insurance"
1015,"00:59:26,081","00:59:27,681","important
to the American people."
1016,"00:59:27,761","00:59:31,681","Governor Reagan, again,
typically is against such a proposal."
1017,"00:59:33,081","00:59:35,521",There you go again.
1018,"00:59:35,601","00:59:39,561","Next Tuesday, you will all go to
the polls and make a decision."
1019,"00:59:39,641","00:59:41,361","And when you make that decision,"
1020,"00:59:41,441","00:59:43,561","I think it would be well
to ask yourself,"
1021,"00:59:44,361","00:59:47,041","are you better off
than you were four years ago?"
1022,"00:59:47,161","00:59:51,641","Is it easier to buy things in the
store than it was four years ago?"
1023,"00:59:52,481","00:59:55,921","Is there more or less
unemployment in the country?"
1024,"00:59:56,041","00:59:59,761","Is America as respected
throughout the world?"
1025,"00:59:59,881","01:00:02,241",Do you feel as safe?
1026,"01:00:02,361","01:00:07,081","Are we as strong
as we were four years ago?"
1027,"01:00:07,201","01:00:10,161","If your answers are ""yes,"""
1028,"01:00:10,281","01:00:12,841","then I think it is obvious
who you will vote for."
1029,"01:00:14,401","01:00:15,841",But if you don't agree...
1030,"01:00:18,161","01:00:20,761","then may I suggest
another choice."
1031,"01:00:23,001","01:00:25,081","...and will,
to the best of my ability."
1032,"01:00:25,161","01:00:27,401","Preserve,
protect and defend."
1033,"01:00:27,481","01:00:29,321","Preserve, protect and defend."
1034,"01:00:29,401","01:00:31,241","The Constitution
of the United States."
1035,"01:00:31,321","01:00:33,561","The Constitution
of the United States."
1036,"01:00:33,641","01:00:35,721","- So help you God.
- So help me God."
1037,"01:00:35,801","01:00:37,160","Congratulations, sir."
1038,"01:00:41,721","01:00:44,521","We will again be
the exemplar of freedom"
1039,"01:00:44,641","01:00:48,081","and the beacon of hope for those
who do not now have freedom."
1040,"01:00:49,321","01:00:51,681","As for the enemies of freedom,"
1041,"01:00:51,801","01:00:53,480",they will be reminded
1042,"01:00:53,601","01:00:56,761","that peace
is the highest aspiration"
1043,"01:00:56,881","01:00:58,721",of the American people.
1044,"01:00:58,841","01:01:03,080","We will negotiate for it,
sacrifice for it,"
1045,"01:01:03,201","01:01:06,721","but we will not surrender
for it."
1046,"01:01:06,841","01:01:09,041",Now or ever.
1047,"01:01:44,360","01:01:48,441","James Baker whips our butt
in '76 working for Ford,"
1048,"01:01:48,521","01:01:51,201","- now he's Chief of Staff.
- Well, that's why he's Chief of Staff."
1049,"01:01:51,281","01:01:54,281","Ed, someone who agrees with you
80% of the time"
1050,"01:01:54,361","01:01:57,281","is an 80% friend,
not a 20% enemy."
1051,"01:01:58,080","01:01:59,161",Excuse me.
1052,"01:02:00,441","01:02:02,721","- Mr. Speaker.
- Mr. President."
1053,"01:02:02,801","01:02:05,441","Congratulations.
Welcome to the Bigs."
1054,"01:02:05,521","01:02:08,001","Now you enjoy tonight
because tomorrow, we go to work."
1055,"01:02:08,080","01:02:10,481","Well, I've been well-briefed
on you, Tip."
1056,"01:02:10,560","01:02:13,041","I've been told I better get
a pretty good head start."
1057,"01:02:13,121","01:02:15,640","- Ah, that's very Irish of you.
- Yes."
1058,"01:02:15,721","01:02:19,081","You plan on going ten rounds every
day, that's how we do things here."
1059,"01:02:19,161","01:02:22,161","All right. Just remember,
every day has a 6:00 p.m."
1060,"01:02:22,241","01:02:23,641","What do you mean by that, sir?"
1061,"01:02:23,720","01:02:26,081","Well, after 6:00,
we're not political enemies."
1062,"01:02:26,161","01:02:27,601","We're just two Irishmen
having a beer."
1063,"01:02:29,200","01:02:30,121",Deal.

1112,"01:05:25,880","01:05:28,720","- you know, Ronnie loves--
- There's been a shooting at the hotel."
1113,"01:05:28,801","01:05:30,441","- What?
- It's all right, ma'am."
1114,"01:05:30,520","01:05:31,801",Your husband wasn't hit.
1115,"01:05:31,880","01:05:33,120",Get me there.
1116,"01:05:33,201","01:05:34,441","Ma'am, I can't do that."
1117,"01:05:34,520","01:05:36,081","Get me there now
or I'm walking."
1118,"01:05:52,720","01:05:54,280",A little hard to breath.
1119,"01:06:03,040","01:06:04,321",Right here under his arm.
1120,"01:06:08,001","01:06:09,200",You told me he wasn't hit.
1121,"01:06:09,281","01:06:10,960","- No, he was.
- Where was he hit?"
1122,"01:06:11,041","01:06:12,441","I don't know.
They're looking for the bullet."
1123,"01:06:12,520","01:06:14,000","- What?
- And Jim Brady was shot in the head."
1124,"01:06:14,081","01:06:16,441","Miss Reagan, I'm sorry,
no one's permitted back there."
1125,"01:06:16,521","01:06:18,960","- You don't wanna see him--
- He has to know I'm here."
1126,"01:06:19,880","01:06:22,520","- Yeah, okay.
- Yes. Excuse me. Excuse me!"
1127,"01:06:23,600","01:06:25,400",We've given him another 300 cc.
1128,"01:06:25,481","01:06:26,961","He's lost a third
of his blood already."
1129,"01:06:27,040","01:06:29,041",Okay. Get him prepped.
1130,"01:06:29,120","01:06:31,881",Where-- where's Nancy?
1131,"01:06:31,960","01:06:35,400","- Ronnie?
- Oh, hey, honey."
1132,"01:06:35,481","01:06:37,840","- I forgot to duck.
- Oh, honey..."
1133,"01:06:40,080","01:06:41,280",Try not to talk.
1134,"01:06:42,361","01:06:44,921","- I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
- You're gonna be okay."
1135,"01:06:46,920","01:06:49,161","- You're gonna be okay.
- I'm fine."
1136,"01:06:49,240","01:06:50,281",Mrs. Reagan.
1137,"01:07:07,321","01:07:09,641","Good evening,
Mr. President."
1138,"01:07:09,720","01:07:12,521","Please tell me
you're Republicans."
1139,"01:07:12,600","01:07:14,441","Today, Mr. President,"
1140,"01:07:14,520","01:07:17,120",we're all Republicans.
1141,"01:07:35,880","01:07:38,161",Come here... Nancy...
1142,"01:07:46,840","01:07:48,841","Hi, Nancy Pants."
1143,"01:07:48,920","01:07:49,961",Mmm.
1144,"01:07:53,840","01:07:55,520",I brought you jelly beans.
1145,"01:07:58,120","01:08:00,040","I knew you'd want them
when you woke up."
1146,"01:08:02,480","01:08:04,641","I had to believe
you were waking up."
1147,"01:08:05,961","01:08:07,881",I don't do so good without you.
1148,"01:08:16,080","01:08:17,320",I should have been there.
1149,"01:08:18,441","01:08:20,641","I always walk
on your left side."
1150,"01:08:20,720","01:08:22,000","No, no."
1151,"01:08:23,121","01:08:24,600",No.
1152,"01:08:24,680","01:08:26,561",But then it would have been you.
1153,"01:08:56,321","01:09:00,120","Boy, you'll do anything
to get that damn tax cut."
1154,"01:09:00,200","01:09:03,800","I left specific orders.
No democrats within 100 yards."
1155,"01:09:03,881","01:09:05,361",You'll have to grin and bear it.
1156,"01:09:06,881","01:09:09,040","- How you doing, pal?
- Well,"
1157,"01:09:09,960","01:09:12,480","- I don't recommend getting shot.
- No."
1158,"01:09:13,960","01:09:16,881","You know, Tip,
I think there is..."
1159,"01:09:16,960","01:09:19,361","I think there is a reason
for all this."
1160,"01:09:20,840","01:09:22,921","There's a big job left
to be done, and..."
1161,"01:09:24,200","01:09:26,680","whatever time I have left, it..."
1162,"01:09:28,161","01:09:29,521",belongs to Him.
1163,"01:09:30,560","01:09:32,160",Ah.
1164,"01:09:32,241","01:09:35,161","""Yea, though I walk through the
valley of the shadow of death,"
1165,"01:09:35,240","01:09:36,720","I shall fear no evil,"

- ""...with me."""

will follow me all"
1168,"01:09:42,681","01:09:44,881",the days of my life.

in the house of the Lord"

if it wasn't for that mug of yours."
1172,"01:09:55,841","01:09:58,560","Well, there were
too many leading men."
1173,"01:10:00,480","01:10:02,680","It should have
killed him and it almost did."
1174,"01:10:02,760","01:10:05,601","Most people don't know
how close it came."
1175,"01:10:05,680","01:10:07,040",Did we do it?
1176,"01:10:07,120","01:10:09,200","No, we didn't do it,"
1177,"01:10:10,160","01:10:13,920","which isn't to say that
some version of a similar plan"
1178,"01:10:14,000","01:10:17,040","didn't exist
in a drawer somewhere,"
1179,"01:10:17,121","01:10:18,881","as it certainly does
to this day."
1180,"01:10:23,240","01:10:25,000","- You're who?
- I'm Dana."
1181,"01:10:25,081","01:10:26,960",I start work today.
1182,"01:10:27,040","01:10:28,800","It's... Yeah, right."
1183,"01:10:28,880","01:10:30,961","Is this Nofziger's
idea of a joke?"
1184,"01:10:31,040","01:10:33,080","I suggest you leave before
the Secret Service get here."
1185,"01:10:33,161","01:10:35,000",The Secret Service let me in.
1186,"01:10:35,081","01:10:36,441","I mean,
you're Mike Deaver, right?"
1187,"01:10:39,440","01:10:41,360","A speech writer?
For the President..."
1188,"01:10:41,440","01:10:43,000",...of the United States?
1189,"01:10:43,080","01:10:45,840","- I think that there's been...
- Dana, you're finally here."
1190,"01:10:45,921","01:10:48,840","Just flew in, sir. I don't even
have a place to stay yet."
1191,"01:10:48,921","01:10:51,280","Did not spend the night
on the lawn, Mr. President."
1192,"01:10:51,360","01:10:53,680","- So you know this gentleman?
- Yes."
1193,"01:10:53,760","01:10:55,040",We go way back.
1194,"01:10:55,801","01:10:57,400",Soviet grain report.
1195,"01:10:57,480","01:11:00,360",Nice nap. I'll trade ya.
1196,"01:11:01,920","01:11:03,840","Well, Dana, I want you
to hurry up and settle in"
1197,"01:11:03,920","01:11:05,560","'cause we have
a lot of work to do."
1198,"01:11:14,441","01:11:15,521",We wear suits here.
1199,"01:11:16,960","01:11:18,841","Right on, Mike. Yeah."
1200,"01:11:21,680","01:11:24,480","Would you maybe have an extra
I could borrow before payday?"
1201,"01:11:24,560","01:11:25,480",Wh--
1202,"01:11:26,241","01:11:27,280",Let me know.
1203,"01:11:31,000","01:11:33,880","First quarter numbers
are below expectations."
1204,"01:11:33,960","01:11:35,520",Unemployment hasn't budged.
1205,"01:11:35,600","01:11:37,240",I think we should reexamine
1206,"01:11:37,320","01:11:39,521","some of the revenue enhancers
on the table, sir."
1207,"01:11:39,600","01:11:41,080",Revenue enhancers?
1208,"01:11:42,080","01:11:44,440",Re-- Is that what you're calling
1209,"01:11:44,520","01:11:46,880","tax increases
these days in Washington?"
1210,"01:11:46,960","01:11:49,480",I told the American people
1211,"01:11:49,561","01:11:51,400",that I would lower taxes.
1212,"01:11:51,481","01:11:53,200","So if that's what
you really think,"
1213,"01:11:53,280","01:11:56,520","then what the hell are you doing
in my administration?"
1214,"01:11:56,600","01:11:59,920","Mr. President, we simply
have to balance this budget."
1215,"01:12:00,000","01:12:02,480","You know, I've learned a thing
or two about economics."
1216,"01:12:02,560","01:12:04,880","I majored in Economics
at Eureka College."
1217,"01:12:04,960","01:12:08,080","Now, it wasn't
your Ivy League college,"
1218,"01:12:08,160","01:12:10,600","but there I learned
about Ibn Khaldun,"
1219,"01:12:10,681","01:12:12,640",he was a ruler in Egypt.
1220,"01:12:12,721","01:12:14,960","And he had a philosophy
that really hit home"
1221,"01:12:15,040","01:12:18,640","when I was in the 94%
tax bracket in Hollywood."
1222,"01:12:18,720","01:12:22,640","And that is when taxes are low,
people have more money."
1223,"01:12:22,720","01:12:25,720","And when people have more money,
they buy more things."
1224,"01:12:25,800","01:12:29,000","Now, these things
have to be made by other people"
1225,"01:12:29,080","01:12:33,080","who have to hire more people
to help them do that."
1226,"01:12:33,161","01:12:35,520","And as for taxes,"
1227,"01:12:35,600","01:12:37,640","well, the good Lord
only asks for 10%,"
1228,"01:12:37,720","01:12:40,600","why should Uncle Sam
ask for more?"
1229,"01:12:40,680","01:12:42,320","Mr. President,"
1230,"01:12:42,400","01:12:44,840","the Air Traffic Controllers
are threatening a strike."
1231,"01:12:44,920","01:12:46,881","- Well, can they do that?
- No, sir."
1232,"01:12:46,960","01:12:48,400","- Legally?
- Essential public service,"
1233,"01:12:48,480","01:12:51,040","they have all signed
a no-strike contract."
1234,"01:12:51,121","01:12:52,960",A contract is a contract.
1235,"01:12:53,960","01:12:55,840",That's the way I learned it.
1236,"01:12:55,921","01:12:58,000",They forfeited their jobs.
1237,"01:12:59,761","01:13:03,960","If he was willing to risk
chaos in his own country,"
1238,"01:13:04,080","01:13:07,160","we could only imagine
what he might do to us."
1239,"01:13:10,601","01:13:14,441","The Soviets are conducting full
exercises right out in the open."
1240,"01:13:14,520","01:13:16,680","German border is quiet
but it looks like they're moving"
1241,"01:13:16,760","01:13:18,800",some brand new SS-20s by rail.
1242,"01:13:18,880","01:13:21,520","That's confirmed.
They're 20 miles east of Berlin."
1243,"01:13:22,520","01:13:25,760","Each rail car contains a ballistic
missile with a nuclear warhead."
1244,"01:13:25,840","01:13:28,320","John, how many nuclear missiles
do they have?"
1245,"01:13:28,400","01:13:29,560",Thirty-five thousand.
1246,"01:13:29,640","01:13:31,600","- Officially.
- And us?"
1247,"01:13:31,680","01:13:33,360","Twenty-five and change, sir."
1248,"01:13:33,440","01:13:36,720","So roughly 60,000
nuclear warheads"
1249,"01:13:36,801","01:13:39,520","pointed at each other,
each one can take out a city."
1250,"01:13:39,600","01:13:41,400","That's about the size of it,
Mr. President."
1251,"01:13:41,480","01:13:43,560","So while we have been,"
1252,"01:13:43,640","01:13:46,200","over the past ten years,
reducing our military,"
1253,"01:13:46,280","01:13:48,160","they've been building up
their arsenal"
1254,"01:13:48,240","01:13:50,241","and thumbing their noses at us,"
1255,"01:13:50,320","01:13:53,200","violating every treaty
that we have with them."
1256,"01:13:53,280","01:13:55,480","More than possible, sir,
that's exactly what's happening."
1257,"01:13:55,560","01:13:59,320","And what have we done about it
except take a picture of it?"
1258,"01:13:59,400","01:14:02,160","Well, after you fire off
the first thousand or so,"
1259,"01:14:02,240","01:14:04,400","there's no one around
to keep score, is there?"
1260,"01:14:04,480","01:14:05,480",It's insane.
1261,"01:14:06,520","01:14:09,800","One little mistake,
somebody has too much vodka,"
1262,"01:14:11,080","01:14:12,280",none of this matters.
1263,"01:14:18,520","01:14:20,320","Thousands were
gathered in St. Peter's Square"
1264,"01:14:20,440","01:14:23,800","at the Vatican today,
cheering the arrival of the Pope."
1265,"01:14:23,920","01:14:27,440","But soon, gunshots turn
the celebration into horror,"
1266,"01:14:27,560","01:14:30,960","as the Pope collapsed
into the arms of his aids."
1267,"01:14:31,040","01:14:33,480","He's in surgery.
The official story"
1268,"01:14:33,560","01:14:35,880","is that he was grazed
but it's worse than that."
1269,"01:14:35,960","01:14:38,120",They gave him his last rites.
1270,"01:14:39,120","01:14:40,560",What do we know?
1271,"01:14:40,640","01:14:42,320","John Paul is from Poland
under Soviet control."
1272,"01:14:42,400","01:14:44,360","Polish people want self-rule
and democracy."
1273,"01:14:44,440","01:14:46,480","Solidarity movement
is taking over the nation."
1274,"01:14:46,560","01:14:48,680","The Pope is with them,"
1275,"01:14:48,760","01:14:51,360","basically giving Moscow the
middle finger because he can."
1276,"01:14:51,440","01:14:54,160","Visit to the homeland
is basically the second coming."
1277,"01:14:54,240","01:14:57,320","The writing's on the wall, this comes
from Moscow via Bulgaria, Mr. President."
1278,"01:14:57,400","01:14:59,280",This is KGB all the way.
1279,"01:14:59,360","01:15:00,960","Well, that doesn't
make sense, Bill."
1280,"01:15:01,040","01:15:02,760","They're either gonna
create a martyr"
1281,"01:15:02,840","01:15:05,560","or they're gonna unleash
the Catholic Church"
1282,"01:15:05,640","01:15:06,880",against themselves.
1283,"01:15:10,280","01:15:11,360",They're scared.
1284,"01:15:12,440","01:15:13,720",The Pope lived.
1285,"01:15:14,960","01:15:16,960","And now, The Crusader
and the Pope"
1286,"01:15:17,080","01:15:20,160","shared a bond of having
survived an assassin's bullet."
1287,"01:15:20,280","01:15:25,080","And his new ally just happened
to have a billion followers."
1288,"01:15:54,080","01:15:55,600",Get out of Poland.
1289,"01:15:55,720","01:15:57,120",Get out of Afghanistan.
1290,"01:15:57,240","01:15:59,160","Throw away
ten years of treaties"
1291,"01:15:59,280","01:16:02,640","and eliminate
all nuclear missiles."
1292,"01:16:02,760","01:16:06,560","As they say in America,
Brezhnev's mind was blown."
1293,"01:16:11,440","01:16:12,440",He scribbles
1294,"01:16:13,320","01:16:17,080","a personal note to me
on yellow paper?"
1295,"01:16:17,160","01:16:19,400","The President
of the United States?"
1296,"01:16:21,400","01:16:22,960",Now we know who shot him.
1297,"01:16:24,520","01:16:26,120",His own State Department.
1298,"01:16:26,200","01:16:28,400",Eh?
1299,"01:16:28,480","01:16:30,280","No, thank you."
1300,"01:16:33,999","01:16:37,760","And now, enter
his new Secretary of State,"
1301,"01:16:37,880","01:16:42,160","- George Shultz, the Tiger Man.
- The who?"
1302,"01:16:42,240","01:16:44,960","He had a tattoo
of a tiger on his ass."
1303,"01:16:45,040","01:16:46,200",How do we know that?
1304,"01:16:46,280","01:16:48,399",KGB. Here.
1305,"01:16:53,760","01:16:56,760","We'll just get
this little ceremony over with."
1306,"01:16:56,840","01:16:59,760","This is what I used to quit
smoking back in the '60s."
1307,"01:17:01,320","01:17:02,400","Oh, I knew it."
1308,"01:17:03,560","01:17:05,800","- I knew it.
- What?"
1309,"01:17:05,880","01:17:08,160","Well, you can tell a lot
about a man's character"
1310,"01:17:08,240","01:17:10,440",by if he chooses just one color
1311,"01:17:10,520","01:17:11,880",or if he grabs a handful.
1312,"01:17:11,960","01:17:13,320",I see.
1313,"01:17:13,400","01:17:15,400","And, uh, what does this say
about my character?"
1314,"01:17:15,480","01:17:17,720","It says that you're focused,"
1315,"01:17:17,800","01:17:19,360","you're determined,"
1316,"01:17:19,440","01:17:21,080","and that you're not
easily distracted."
1317,"01:17:21,160","01:17:22,480",You're gonna do great here.
1318,"01:17:23,320","01:17:25,320","Okay, then."
1319,"01:17:25,400","01:17:28,640","America has hired us
to do two things."
1320,"01:17:28,719","01:17:31,560","Let them be prosperous again,"
1321,"01:17:32,559","01:17:33,920",and keep them safe.
1322,"01:17:34,000","01:17:35,560",Peace through strength.
1323,"01:17:35,640","01:17:36,760",May I speak freely?
1324,"01:17:36,840","01:17:38,120",I expect it.
1325,"01:17:38,200","01:17:40,560",Clarity is power.
1326,"01:17:40,640","01:17:43,440","Now, I believe you are clear
in these objectives."
1327,"01:17:43,520","01:17:45,360","Now, the rest of the world
needs to be."
1328,"01:17:45,440","01:17:47,480","As long as those objectives
are your objectives."
1329,"01:17:47,560","01:17:49,560","They are, Mr. Clark.
Which isn't to say"
1330,"01:17:49,640","01:17:52,240","that I won't push back
or voice opinions"
1331,"01:17:52,319","01:17:54,639","if I see conflict
in those objectives."
1332,"01:17:54,720","01:17:56,440",That's exactly why I chose you.
1333,"01:17:56,520","01:17:58,240","Peace through
strength is, it's--"
1334,"01:17:58,320","01:17:59,999",It's just a-a bit opaque.
1335,"01:18:00,080","01:18:03,520","I-I need you to articulate
a message about the Soviets"
1336,"01:18:03,600","01:18:05,280",that I can take to the world.
1337,"01:18:06,640","01:18:07,920","Well, that's simple."
1338,"01:18:08,760","01:18:09,880",We win.
1339,"01:18:09,960","01:18:11,200",They lose.
1340,"01:18:11,280","01:18:12,560",And you can quote me.
1341,"01:18:15,440","01:18:16,840","Well, that's a clear message."
1342,"01:18:45,280","01:18:47,560","- Hey, Dutch, where you going?
- Come on, Dutch!"
1343,"01:18:49,000","01:18:50,879","- Scaredy-cat!
- Four eyes!"
1344,"01:18:50,960","01:18:52,440","That's the boy
that's been threatening you?"
1345,"01:18:52,519","01:18:54,520","- Every day.
- Get over here!"
1346,"01:18:55,920","01:18:58,880","- Mama's boy.
- He'll be there tomorrow too."
1347,"01:18:58,959","01:19:01,200","That's what bullies do
until you stand up to them."
1348,"01:19:02,119","01:19:03,560","It's time for you
to settle this, Dutch."
1349,"01:19:04,520","01:19:05,480",Go on.
1350,"01:19:10,200","01:19:11,360","Come on, Mama's boy."
1351,"01:19:17,800","01:19:19,399",Get him.
1352,"01:19:49,920","01:19:51,400",It's a little soft.
1353,"01:19:52,360","01:19:53,520","We'll get it there, sir."
1354,"01:19:55,720","01:19:58,280",Dana? A word.
1355,"01:20:05,600","01:20:09,080","Well, I see you still have
one foot in California."
1356,"01:20:12,000","01:20:16,199","I am about to start
the biggest war of this century."
1357,"01:20:17,240","01:20:18,400",Maybe of all time.
1358,"01:20:19,680","01:20:21,760","And I'm not gonna fire
a single shot."
1359,"01:20:22,720","01:20:24,480",I'm gonna fight it with words.
1360,"01:20:26,040","01:20:30,240","And they have to count
every single one of them."
1361,"01:20:30,319","01:20:32,840","So say what you mean,"
1362,"01:20:32,919","01:20:34,279",mean what you say.
1363,"01:20:35,919","01:20:38,360","I need the guy
who camped out in my yard."
1364,"01:20:38,440","01:20:39,400",You understand?
1365,"01:20:49,080","01:20:50,599",And let us pray
1366,"01:20:50,680","01:20:52,760","for the salvation
of those who live"
1367,"01:20:52,840","01:20:54,920",in that totalitarian darkness.
1368,"01:20:56,040","01:20:58,640","Let us pray
that they will discover"
1369,"01:20:58,719","01:21:00,520",the joy of knowing God
1370,"01:21:01,159","01:21:04,319","and let us be aware that while
their unelected leaders"
1371,"01:21:04,400","01:21:06,720","preach the supremacy
of the State,"
1372,"01:21:06,799","01:21:10,320","declare its omnipotence
over individual man"
1373,"01:21:10,400","01:21:12,320","and predict
its eventual domination"
1374,"01:21:12,399","01:21:14,280","of all the peoples of the Earth,"
1375,"01:21:14,359","01:21:17,840","they are the focus of evil
in the modern world."
1376,"01:21:19,200","01:21:20,440","It was C.S. Lewis,"
1377,"01:21:20,560","01:21:24,720","who in his magnificent
Screwtape Letters wrote,"
1378,"01:21:24,800","01:21:27,280","""The greatest evil is not done"
1379,"01:21:27,359","01:21:30,760","in those sordid dens of crime
that Dickens loved to paint"
1380,"01:21:30,880","01:21:35,760","nor is it done in the concentration
camps and labor camps."
1381,"01:21:35,879","01:21:39,159","In them,
we see its final result."
1382,"01:21:39,279","01:21:41,639",But it is conceived and ordered
1383,"01:21:41,759","01:21:45,960","in clear, carpeted, warmed,
and well-lighted offices"
1384,"01:21:46,080","01:21:49,760","by quiet men with white collars
and cut fingernails"
1385,"01:21:49,879","01:21:51,919","who do not need to raise
their voices,"
1386,"01:21:52,039","01:21:55,680","but speak in soothing tones
of brotherhood and peace."""
1387,"01:21:56,559","01:22:00,320","Beware the temptation
to ignore the facts of history,"
1388,"01:22:00,439","01:22:03,880","and the aggressive impulses
of an evil empire."
1389,"01:22:05,759","01:22:06,680",Yes!
1390,"01:22:11,320","01:22:13,879","I think the President's words
were a little irresponsible."
1391,"01:22:13,999","01:22:16,840","Last thing we need to do
is heat this Cold War up."
1392,"01:22:16,960","01:22:19,400","While the President
clearly thought tonight..."
1393,"01:22:19,479","01:22:21,440","What is wrong
with these people?"
1394,"01:22:21,519","01:22:23,160","I mean, whose side
are they on, anyway?"
1395,"01:22:23,240","01:22:27,039","Oh, honey, you can't pay
any attention to that."
1396,"01:22:27,120","01:22:30,520","But I have to. Most of the country
is paying attention to them."
1397,"01:22:30,599","01:22:34,200","Well, if you think that got their
undies in a wad, you just wait."
1398,"01:22:35,119","01:22:38,679","We have prevented nuclear war
for more than three decades."
1399,"01:22:38,760","01:22:42,639","Recently, however,
it has become clear we cannot rely solely"
1400,"01:22:42,720","01:22:46,040","on offensive retaliation
to maintain peace."
1401,"01:22:46,119","01:22:48,399","I call upon
the scientific community,"
1402,"01:22:48,480","01:22:50,720","those who gave us
nuclear weapons"
1403,"01:22:50,800","01:22:55,839","to turn their great talents now to
the cause of mankind and world peace."
1404,"01:22:55,920","01:22:58,480","To build this defensive

he starred in, in 1940."
1408,"01:23:07,960","01:23:12,600","And with his economy booming,
he now had the money to spend."
1409,"01:23:14,040","01:23:15,400",But it didn't exist.
1410,"01:23:15,480","01:23:16,480",Small detail.
1411,"01:23:17,560","01:23:19,640","- Small detail?
- Let's just say"
1412,"01:23:19,719","01:23:22,439","he was characteristically
optimistic."
1413,"01:23:22,520","01:23:23,880",So he was lying.
1414,"01:23:23,959","01:23:25,479",Here. Eat something.
1415,"01:23:25,560","01:23:27,079","Viktor Petrovich,
it didn't exist."
1416,"01:23:27,160","01:23:28,400",It was science fiction.
1417,"01:23:28,479","01:23:31,079","But the missiles, missiles did!"
1418,"01:23:31,160","01:23:32,360",Doesn't matter.
1419,"01:23:33,040","01:23:35,479","The Crusader
was making his move."
1420,"01:23:35,560","01:23:37,040",And we knew it.
1421,"01:23:40,040","01:23:41,440",And then something happened.
1422,"01:23:43,640","01:23:44,720",Like what?
1423,"01:24:00,959","01:24:04,439","Korean Airlines,
you are in Soviet airspace."
1424,"01:24:04,519","01:24:05,919",Move out now.
1425,"01:24:17,719","01:24:19,280","Command,
there is no response."
1426,"01:24:19,400","01:24:21,039","Appears to be
commercial flight."
1427,"01:24:21,159","01:24:23,400","- Shoot it down.
- Are you sure?"
1428,"01:24:23,520","01:24:25,239",I see flashing indicators.
1429,"01:24:25,359","01:24:27,999","- Shoot it down.
- Copy that."
1430,"01:24:47,400","01:24:48,839",A civilian airliner?
1431,"01:24:48,959","01:24:50,400",CIA spy plane.
1432,"01:24:50,519","01:24:52,080",They were warned repeatedly.
1433,"01:24:52,159","01:24:54,079",It was a commercial flight!

and sixty-nine people"
1435,"01:24:56,200","01:24:57,479","are dead, Anatoly,"
1436,"01:24:57,599","01:24:59,320","including one
of our congressman!"
1437,"01:24:59,399","01:25:01,520","- George...
- You crossed a line."

adversaries continue to escalate."
1439,"01:25:15,279","01:25:17,959","President Reagan
called it an act of barbarism."

remain on alert across Europe."
1441,"01:25:21,160","01:25:23,279","Many are concerned
at home and abroad"
1442,"01:25:23,399","01:25:26,480","that these actions bring the
United States and the Soviet Union"
1443,"01:25:26,599","01:25:29,400","a step closer
to a direct military conflict."
1444,"01:25:30,799","01:25:32,520","And three weeks later,"
1445,"01:25:32,640","01:25:36,520","our radar systems detected
the unthinkable."
1446,"01:25:38,639","01:25:41,600","Triggering a terrifying
response of action."
1447,"01:25:44,600","01:25:47,519","- This is not a drill.
- Do we have confirmation on this?"

six sites."
1449,"01:25:49,280","01:25:50,999","That's 18 million
American lives."
1450,"01:25:51,079","01:25:52,199","They think we're launching, sir."
1451,"01:25:52,280","01:25:53,479",Prepare for DEFCON 1.
1452,"01:25:53,559","01:25:55,519",I need confirmation.
1453,"01:25:55,599","01:25:59,599","Mr. President, if this is real,
we won't have time for confirmation."
1454,"01:26:03,559","01:26:05,119",We need a decision.
1455,"01:27:05,400","01:27:07,359","They're aborting, sir.
They're standing down."
1456,"01:27:07,440","01:27:09,640","Okay, sir. I'll let them know."
1457,"01:27:09,719","01:27:12,319",We're that close.
1458,"01:27:12,399","01:27:15,120","Looks like a flock of geese
triggered a positive radar hit."
1459,"01:27:15,199","01:27:16,399","- Ah, Jesus.
- Ah."
1460,"01:27:17,600","01:27:18,999",I can't believe it.
1461,"01:27:20,719","01:27:23,959","The Cold War
was in full swing."
1462,"01:27:24,079","01:27:27,759","The Crusader knew he had
to keep the pressure on us,"
1463,"01:27:27,880","01:27:30,719","but making sure
there were no more mistakes."
1464,"01:27:31,919","01:27:35,960","But before he could resume
his crusade against us,"
1465,"01:27:36,079","01:27:38,040","he would have to face
his voters."
1466,"01:27:39,079","01:27:43,479","And let's just say, not everyone
thought he was the right choice."
1467,"01:27:53,039","01:27:55,320",Ah. Goody two-shoes.
1468,"01:28:59,839","01:29:03,519","Mr. Mondale's poll numbers
have been steadily rising."
1469,"01:29:03,639","01:29:07,159","Concerns have been raised

in the last debate."

1473,"01:29:16,799","01:29:18,840","So how do you adjust
for inflation, uh,"
1474,"01:29:18,919","01:29:21,919","between the six
and twelve percent projections?"
1475,"01:29:21,999","01:29:23,839","Well, you know,"
1476,"01:29:24,679","01:29:28,079","that with the adding
of four million..."
1477,"01:29:31,879","01:29:33,999",Three million new jobs
1478,"01:29:34,079","01:29:36,879","and the rate
of unemployment being..."
1479,"01:29:42,079","01:29:43,159",Okay.
1480,"01:29:43,240","01:29:45,519",Stop. Stop.
1481,"01:29:46,400","01:29:47,719",I need a break.
1482,"01:29:53,319","01:29:55,919","Mr. President,
we really feel that..."
1483,"01:29:56,000","01:29:57,640","w-we just need to do this
all over again."
1484,"01:29:57,719","01:29:59,799","No. I've had enough, Ed."
1485,"01:30:00,599","01:30:04,199","Say, M-Mr. President, I forgot,
what's your favorite movie?"
1486,"01:30:05,320","01:30:06,639",The Sound of Music.
1487,"01:30:07,559","01:30:09,119","What do you say,
you and Mrs. Reagan"
1488,"01:30:09,199","01:30:10,719","get together
and watch it tonight?"
1489,"01:30:10,799","01:30:12,559","Relax, calm your mind."
1490,"01:30:12,639","01:30:13,960","You'll be back
in the saddle tomorrow."
1491,"01:30:14,039","01:30:16,239",And we'll be ready to go.
1492,"01:30:16,319","01:30:18,439","- That's a great idea.
- Well..."
1493,"01:30:19,399","01:30:22,319","when God closes a door,
He opens a window, doesn't He?"
1494,"01:30:31,639","01:30:33,079","Gentlemen,"
1495,"01:30:33,159","01:30:36,119","instead of cramming his head
with useless numbers,"
1496,"01:30:36,199","01:30:38,359","why don't you let
Ronnie be Ronnie?"
1497,"01:30:39,239","01:30:40,160",Okay?
1498,"01:30:45,399","01:30:46,599","Uh, anybody else have..."
1499,"01:30:46,719","01:30:48,279",Aha. Martha?
1500,"01:30:48,399","01:30:49,439","Yes, Father."
1501,"01:30:49,559","01:30:50,519",You tell me.
1502,"01:30:51,759","01:30:53,399","Friedrich told you, Father."
1503,"01:30:54,239","01:30:55,800",We were berry picking.
1504,"01:30:55,919","01:30:58,879","I forgot!
You were berry picking."
1505,"01:30:58,999","01:31:00,519","- Yes!
- We love berry picking."
1506,"01:31:00,639","01:31:01,799","- All afternoon?
- Mm-hmm!"
1507,"01:31:01,919","01:31:03,879","- We picked thousands.
- Thousands?"
1508,"01:31:03,999","01:31:05,759",They were all over the place.
1509,"01:31:05,879","01:31:07,159",What kind of berries?
1510,"01:31:07,279","01:31:08,999","- Blueberries, sir.
- Blueberries!"
1511,"01:31:09,119","01:31:11,839","- Yes!
- Yes! Blue!"
1512,"01:31:11,879","01:31:14,719","It's, uh,
too early for blueberries."
1513,"01:31:15,960","01:31:17,559",They were strawberries.
1514,"01:31:17,679","01:31:20,839","Mr.
 Trewhitt, your question to President Reagan."
1515,"01:31:20,959","01:31:23,839","Mr. President, I wanna raise an issue
that I think has been lurking out there"
1516,"01:31:23,959","01:31:26,199","for two or three weeks,
and cast it specifically"
1517,"01:31:26,279","01:31:28,159",in national security terms.
1518,"01:31:28,239","01:31:30,519","You already are the oldest
President in history"
1519,"01:31:30,599","01:31:32,280","and some of your staff say
that you were tired"
1520,"01:31:32,359","01:31:35,160","after your most recent encounter
with Mr. Mondale."
1521,"01:31:35,239","01:31:38,119","I recall yet that President
Kennedy had to go for days on end"
1522,"01:31:38,199","01:31:40,559","with very little sleep
during the Cuban Missile Crisis."
1523,"01:31:40,639","01:31:42,999","Is there any doubt in your mind
that you would be able to function"
1524,"01:31:43,079","01:31:44,799",in such circumstances?
1525,"01:31:44,879","01:31:46,799","Not at all, Mr. Trewhitt."
1526,"01:31:46,879","01:31:48,559","And I want you to know
that, also,"
1527,"01:31:48,639","01:31:52,039","I will not make age
an issue in this campaign."
1528,"01:31:52,119","01:31:55,279","I will not
for political purposes,"
1529,"01:31:55,359","01:31:58,639","exploit my opponent's youth
and inexperience."
1530,"01:32:02,559","01:32:04,999","And with that
one thrust of wit..."
1531,"01:32:10,279","01:32:11,599",he turned the tide.
1532,"01:32:23,839","01:32:29,479","USA, USA, USA, USA!"
1533,"01:32:31,679","01:32:33,719","- He'll be there.
- You wanted to see me, sir?"
1534,"01:32:34,559","01:32:36,399","No, we'll figure it out."
1535,"01:32:36,479","01:32:38,719","Yeah. Yeah, John."
1536,"01:32:38,799","01:32:42,159","Uh, there's a rumor around here
that you're a... a horse guy."
1537,"01:32:42,239","01:32:43,879","Yup, I rode for Boston PD."
1538,"01:32:43,959","01:32:46,519","I've been riding my whole life,
really. Why?"
1539,"01:32:46,599","01:32:48,559","We've been having some issues
at the Western White House"
1540,"01:32:48,639","01:32:50,479","- out in California.
- What kind of issues?"
1541,"01:32:50,559","01:32:51,599",Nobody can ride.
1542,"01:32:52,399","01:32:55,239","Yeah, Rawhide isn't gonna say
anything but it's pretty embarrassing"
1543,"01:32:55,319","01:32:57,759","when one of ours has to walk
his horse when he wants to run."
1544,"01:32:57,839","01:32:58,919",You mean gallop.
1545,"01:32:58,999","01:32:59,959",Yeah. Whatever.
1546,"01:33:00,999","01:33:04,319","But, uh, do you wanna head up
that detail when we travel?"
1547,"01:33:06,919","01:33:11,599","So I'd be riding horses
with the... with the President?"
1548,"01:33:12,439","01:33:13,399",Giddyap.
1549,"01:33:15,679","01:33:17,399","- Okay.
- All right."
1550,"01:33:21,519","01:33:24,319","Unlike
other presidents,"
1551,"01:33:24,439","01:33:28,639","The Crusader was in no rush
to meet with us."
1552,"01:33:28,679","01:33:30,799",This created a problem.
1553,"01:33:36,159","01:33:37,639",Here's the latest.
1554,"01:33:46,239","01:33:47,238","This here,"
1555,"01:33:48,359","01:33:49,439",this is only...
1556,"01:34:02,559","01:34:05,119","How can I talk to them
if they keep dying on me?"
1557,"01:34:10,278","01:34:13,679","We are starving for energy, Ron,
and we've got to get it somewhere"
1558,"01:34:13,759","01:34:16,239","and we can't afford
what we've been paying."
1559,"01:34:16,319","01:34:18,279","But buying it
from the Soviet Union?"
1560,"01:34:18,359","01:34:22,959","You know that that money is going
directly into a missile pointed at you."
1561,"01:34:23,038","01:34:24,719","Mr. President,"
1562,"01:34:25,599","01:34:27,399",give me an alternative.
1563,"01:34:27,479","01:34:32,358","The Saudis have agreed
to increase oil production,"
1564,"01:34:32,439","01:34:35,599","as long as we buy it from them,
not the Russians."
1565,"01:34:35,679","01:34:38,999","And if we can get our friends
to go along with us."
1566,"01:34:39,078","01:34:42,319","And you can sell this at home?
To your Texans?"
1567,"01:34:42,399","01:34:44,879","It will drop oil
to under ten dollars a barrel."
1568,"01:34:44,959","01:34:47,319","Oh, I'll take a political hit
for it, that's for sure."
1569,"01:34:47,399","01:34:49,799","And Texans love to make money,
yes, they do."
1570,"01:34:49,879","01:34:51,319",We all do.
1571,"01:34:51,399","01:34:53,519","But they love
their freedom even more."
1572,"01:34:53,599","01:34:58,359","First, the Evil Empire
and now this."
1573,"01:34:58,439","01:35:00,559","You're certainly not looking
to make friends."
1574,"01:35:00,639","01:35:01,919","No, I'm not."
1575,"01:35:01,999","01:35:03,799",But perhaps you should.
1576,"01:35:03,879","01:35:05,519","I met their new man, Gorbachev."
1577,"01:35:05,599","01:35:08,199","He is a very different
kind of Russian."
1578,"01:35:08,279","01:35:13,479","And I told him you were
a very, very different kind"
1579,"01:35:13,559","01:35:15,158",of an American.
1580,"01:35:18,759","01:35:21,519","- Pushing up the draft. All right.
- Ah!"
1581,"01:35:21,598","01:35:23,199","- Ow! Oh, oh.
- Hey, hey. Quiet. Shh!"
1582,"01:35:24,679","01:35:26,919","Good evening. President Reagan
is in Geneva tonight"
1583,"01:35:27,039","01:35:28,479",ready for the Gorbachev summit.
1584,"01:35:30,999","01:35:33,959","The baron is honored
to have you stay at his home"
1585,"01:35:34,039","01:35:35,799","- for this occasion.
- Thank you."
1586,"01:35:35,879","01:35:37,759","Please let him know
how much we appreciate it."
1587,"01:35:37,839","01:35:41,559",Uh... The goldfish.
1588,"01:35:41,639","01:35:45,119","It seems that the baron's son
is very attached to it."
1589,"01:35:45,198","01:35:47,999","It needs to be fed
twice every day."
1590,"01:35:48,078","01:35:50,398","Well, I will, uh,
do it personally."
1591,"01:35:53,439","01:35:56,359","There are a few things
I can do myself, you know?"
1592,"01:36:03,079","01:36:05,119","- They've arrived.
- Oh."
1593,"01:36:05,198","01:36:07,118","Oh, then... Yes."
1594,"01:36:08,719","01:36:09,998",Here we go.
1595,"01:36:10,079","01:36:12,159","Oh, no. Coat off."
1596,"01:36:12,239","01:36:13,838",It's below freezing out there.
1597,"01:36:13,919","01:36:16,038","The whole world is watching
this meeting, George."
1598,"01:36:16,119","01:36:19,039","He needs to look his best,
and that overcoat is not working."
1599,"01:36:19,119","01:36:20,679","Well, you guys
are in charge of policy,"
1600,"01:36:20,759","01:36:23,519","but even the leader
of the free world has a boss,"
1601,"01:36:23,598","01:36:26,919","and she's in charge
of presentation."
1602,"01:36:29,159","01:36:31,039","And before
the summit had begun,"
1603,"01:36:31,159","01:36:34,438","we found ourselves already
at a disadvantage,"
1604,"01:36:34,558","01:36:37,998","as the President looked better
than the General Secretary."
1605,"01:36:46,719","01:36:49,559",Let me state at the outset.
1606,"01:36:49,638","01:36:51,639",You should have no illusions
1607,"01:36:51,718","01:36:53,679",that you can bankrupt us.
1608,"01:36:53,799","01:36:56,279","The Crusader
took it all in stride..."
1609,"01:36:56,399","01:37:00,078","- We can match you on land...
- ...hearing it for what it was."
1610,"01:37:00,159","01:37:04,038",...and air and space.
1611,"01:37:06,159","01:37:07,999","Mandatory messaging
from the Party."
1612,"01:37:10,959","01:37:12,479","As I see it,"
1613,"01:37:12,558","01:37:16,919","we don't mistrust each other
because we're armed."
1614,"01:37:16,999","01:37:18,759",We're armed
1615,"01:37:18,839","01:37:21,318",because we mistrust each other.
1616,"01:37:22,999","01:37:26,479","But I think that we both agree
on the most important thing."
1617,"01:37:27,119","01:37:30,679",A nuclear war can never be won
1618,"01:37:30,759","01:37:32,998",and must never be fought.
1619,"01:37:36,479","01:37:38,039",He's definitely ambiguous.
1620,"01:37:38,119","01:37:40,398","It's perfectly clear, there's
nothing ambiguous about it."
1621,"01:37:40,479","01:37:42,519","You come out ahead
as you usually do."
1622,"01:37:42,598","01:37:45,919","Violation after violation
of SALT I and II."
1623,"01:37:45,998","01:37:49,239","Violation? This is nothing more
than you militarizing space."
1624,"01:37:54,879","01:37:59,159","I saw a gentle smile
that never left his face."
1625,"01:38:00,239","01:38:04,278","He was disarming,
but still he was the zealot"
1626,"01:38:04,398","01:38:06,559",that called us an Evil Empire.
1627,"01:38:06,679","01:38:08,959","And we could not let
our guard down."
1628,"01:38:09,038","01:38:12,239","You know, I used to do
a little acting"
1629,"01:38:12,319","01:38:14,719","a couple hundred years ago
back in Hollywood."
1630,"01:38:14,798","01:38:17,278","Let me show you how we used
to handle this sort of thing."
1631,"01:38:25,638","01:38:26,598",Take two.
1632,"01:38:29,518","01:38:31,678","Hello, Mikhail.
My name's Ron."
1633,"01:38:36,078","01:38:38,039","How would you like to go
for a little walk?"
1634,"01:38:51,038","01:38:52,958","What they say
about you, Mr. President,"
1635,"01:38:53,039","01:38:56,078","""He picks your pocket and
makes you feel good about it."""
1636,"01:38:56,159","01:39:00,159","Well, I've had much worse
said about me before, way worse."
1637,"01:39:00,238","01:39:02,639",As have I. Hazard of our job.
1638,"01:39:04,839","01:39:06,278",I want to let you know
1639,"01:39:07,119","01:39:09,719","that we seek
the same thing, Mikhail."
1640,"01:39:10,638","01:39:11,959","Do we, Ron?"
1641,"01:39:12,838","01:39:15,038","We are not here
because we need to be."
1642,"01:39:15,119","01:39:17,679","We desire peace,
just as you do."
1643,"01:39:18,478","01:39:21,679","But your proposal
is not so simple."
1644,"01:39:21,758","01:39:24,878","Oh, actually,
it is very simple."
1645,"01:39:26,158","01:39:27,439",It's just not easy.
1646,"01:39:28,959","01:39:33,359","But I believe that you and I,
we can do it."
1647,"01:39:33,439","01:39:35,198","In fact, we must."
1648,"01:39:35,959","01:39:37,279",The world demands it.
1649,"01:39:37,358","01:39:39,359","And after all,
isn't that who we work for?"
1650,"01:39:39,438","01:39:41,959",The people and the man upstairs.
1651,"01:39:42,038","01:39:44,678",Ah. The man upstairs.
1652,"01:39:45,839","01:39:48,439","My grandmother
was a Christian woman,"
1653,"01:39:48,518","01:39:50,438",go to church every day.
1654,"01:39:50,519","01:39:52,119","And after, would say,"
1655,"01:39:52,198","01:39:54,558","""Mikhail,
I went to church today."
1656,"01:39:54,638","01:39:56,838",I prayed for the atheist.
1657,"01:39:56,919","01:39:58,839","I prayed for you."""
1658,"01:39:58,918","01:40:02,198","Well, I think that
your grandmother and my mother"
1659,"01:40:02,279","01:40:04,039","could have been
very good friends."
1660,"01:40:05,679","01:40:07,118",So you're the Tiger Man.
1661,"01:40:07,199","01:40:09,358",Excuse me? Tiger Man?
1662,"01:40:09,439","01:40:12,039","I like American baseball,
very much."
1663,"01:40:12,119","01:40:13,519","Oh, yeah?
Who's your favorite team?"
1664,"01:40:13,598","01:40:15,599",New York Yankees. And you?
1665,"01:40:15,678","01:40:17,678","Uh, St. Louis Cardinals."
1666,"01:40:18,638","01:40:21,039","Game 7, World Series."
1667,"01:40:21,118","01:40:24,398","Very sorry, but what series?"
1668,"01:40:24,479","01:40:27,079","Oh, next time you're in the States,
I'll make sure you get to a game."
1669,"01:40:29,039","01:40:31,118","No, no, no, no.
Let them talk."
1670,"01:40:31,199","01:40:32,999","You go in there, you're fired."
1671,"01:40:36,358","01:40:37,438",Tiger Man.
1672,"01:40:38,479","01:40:39,958",My proposal...
1673,"01:40:41,119","01:40:42,079",is this.
1674,"01:40:42,798","01:40:44,598","That you and I,"
1675,"01:40:44,679","01:40:47,598","by the time that I leave office,"
1676,"01:40:47,679","01:40:51,799","can reduce
our missile counts by half."
1677,"01:40:52,999","01:40:53,918",Hmm.
1678,"01:40:55,718","01:40:57,839",I'm not a patient man either.
1679,"01:40:59,158","01:41:01,799",I do not intend to leave office
1680,"01:41:01,878","01:41:03,319","before they are gone,"
1681,"01:41:04,078","01:41:05,079",completely.
1682,"01:41:20,118","01:41:21,358","Oh, no."
1683,"01:41:21,439","01:41:23,238","Honey, look what I've done."
1684,"01:41:23,319","01:41:24,559","Oh, dear."
1685,"01:41:24,638","01:41:26,118",Maybe we can find another one.
1686,"01:41:26,199","01:41:28,959","Uh, Mr. President, we-we go live
in five-five minutes."
1687,"01:41:29,038","01:41:30,879","Oh, I-I think we should
find another one."
1688,"01:41:30,958","01:41:32,119","Oh, no!"
1689,"01:41:32,198","01:41:34,199",Every kid knows his goldfish.
1690,"01:41:34,279","01:41:35,598",I'm gonna write him a note.
1691,"01:41:35,679","01:41:37,079",W-we need to go now.
1692,"01:41:37,159","01:41:39,438","I mean, the entire world
is waiting."
1693,"01:41:39,519","01:41:41,238",The world can wait.
1694,"01:41:41,319","01:41:43,718",I'm going to write him a note.
1695,"01:41:43,799","01:41:47,718","- Nancy...
- That's my Ronnie."
1696,"01:41:47,838","01:41:51,159","- We have to wait.
- Nothing was really agreed to yet"
1697,"01:41:51,278","01:41:52,998",beyond agreeing to meet again.
1698,"01:41:53,119","01:41:56,919","But the Soviet Union and USA
were talking to one another"
1699,"01:41:57,038","01:41:59,159",instead of at one another.
1700,"01:42:12,039","01:42:16,078","Reagan's allies
against us included the Pope,"
1701,"01:42:16,198","01:42:18,398","Thatcher, the Iron Lady,"
1702,"01:42:18,518","01:42:22,918","and leaders of West Germany
and Japan, Cole and Nakasone."
1703,"01:42:22,999","01:42:24,919",We stand firmly behind you.
1704,"01:42:26,118","01:42:28,438","When you speak
with Secretary Gorbachev,"
1705,"01:42:29,879","01:42:32,599","you are speaking
for us in free world."
1706,"01:42:32,719","01:42:34,038","Well, we understand"
1707,"01:42:34,119","01:42:36,878","that you are surrounded
by communists,"
1708,"01:42:36,958","01:42:39,439","and we appreciate
you standing with us."
1709,"01:42:39,558","01:42:41,598","Be careful. Remember,"
1710,"01:42:41,718","01:42:45,998","communists have no problem with
lying to achieve their goals."
1711,"01:42:46,078","01:42:49,558","They are testing you
to see if you will stand firm."
1712,"01:42:49,678","01:42:52,759","Don't worry. I dealt with
these guys back in Hollywood."
1713,"01:42:52,879","01:42:55,038","I even have the scars
on my back to prove it."
1714,"01:42:55,118","01:42:56,599","And I promise you,"
1715,"01:42:57,598","01:42:58,998",we're not going to lose.
1716,"01:43:00,678","01:43:04,078","In other news, President Reagan
has landed in Reykjavík, Iceland"
1717,"01:43:04,198","01:43:07,918","to continue discussions with Soviet
Premier Gorbachev over nuclear disarmament."
1718,"01:43:09,118","01:43:11,758","Fifty percent
across the board reduction."
1719,"01:43:11,839","01:43:16,479","All weapons groups,
tactical, INF, ICBM."
1720,"01:43:16,558","01:43:20,518","In exchange, suspension of your
Strategic Defense Initiative."
1721,"01:43:20,599","01:43:23,398","""Star Wars,"" some refer to it."
1722,"01:43:25,559","01:43:26,718",Counter proposal.
1723,"01:43:28,478","01:43:32,239","We share all SDI technology,"
1724,"01:43:33,118","01:43:34,518","we develop it together,"
1725,"01:43:35,279","01:43:37,118",we'll even pay for it.
1726,"01:43:37,199","01:43:40,958","And we eliminate
all ballistic missiles"
1727,"01:43:41,039","01:43:43,519",in ten years. Together.
1728,"01:43:43,598","01:43:46,838","You refuse to share
oil-drilling technology"
1729,"01:43:46,919","01:43:48,398",and you offer this?
1730,"01:43:48,478","01:43:53,078","SDI is a completely
defensive system."
1731,"01:43:56,038","01:43:57,958","This is the line,
Mr. President."
1732,"01:43:58,918","01:44:00,158","If you walk away,"
1733,"01:44:00,958","01:44:03,278","you will have missed the chance
of going down in history"
1734,"01:44:03,358","01:44:07,198","as the president who paved the
way for nuclear disarmament."
1735,"01:44:07,278","01:44:10,958","How will you explain this
to your ""free people?"""
1736,"01:44:12,518","01:44:13,959","Mr. President,"
1737,"01:44:14,038","01:44:17,878","I'm offering you the biggest win
of your presidency."
1738,"01:44:19,719","01:44:21,759",Just drop SDI.
1739,"01:44:45,518","01:44:46,478",Nyet.
1740,"01:44:50,318","01:44:51,679","Let's go, George."
1741,"01:44:59,359","01:45:02,038","You would lose the whole deal
over this one thing?"
1742,"01:45:02,118","01:45:03,479",This is a fair offer.
1743,"01:45:04,718","01:45:06,398",As was mine.
1744,"01:45:06,479","01:45:08,399","I don't know what more
I could have done."
1745,"01:45:10,999","01:45:12,598",You could have said yes.
1746,"01:45:16,639","01:45:19,598","After he walked away
from the negotiating table,"
1747,"01:45:19,718","01:45:22,238",we were in a very dark place.
1748,"01:45:22,358","01:45:24,078","We knew it was over,"
1749,"01:45:24,198","01:45:26,798","unless something
extraordinary happened."
1750,"01:45:30,278","01:45:34,199","We've intercepted two more
shipments of Soviet RPGs and AK-47s"
1751,"01:45:34,278","01:45:36,598","coming out of Cuba,
headed for Nicaragua."
1752,"01:45:37,358","01:45:39,638","The freedom fighters
are holed up in the mountains."
1753,"01:45:39,718","01:45:42,038","It's David and Goliath,
but they're making a go of it."
1754,"01:45:43,118","01:45:44,678","Well, I like these guys."
1755,"01:45:44,759","01:45:48,039","They remind me of Washington
and the Continental Army."
1756,"01:45:48,118","01:45:49,478",What do they need?
1757,"01:45:49,559","01:45:51,318",What do they always need?
1758,"01:45:51,398","01:45:52,998","Band-Aids, guns, and money."
1759,"01:45:54,038","01:45:55,918","Well, give them what they want."
1760,"01:45:55,999","01:45:59,598","Mr. President, we won't have the
Congress with us on this one."
1761,"01:46:08,879","01:46:11,238","And nothing
but the truth, so help you God?"
1762,"01:46:11,359","01:46:12,558","- I do.
- Please be seated."
1763,"01:46:13,638","01:46:15,798","The American Congress
had said no"
1764,"01:46:15,918","01:46:18,798","to giving money to his friends
in Nicaragua."
1765,"01:46:18,918","01:46:22,199","And The Crusader had hostages
in the Middle East"
1766,"01:46:22,318","01:46:24,078",and needed to free them.
1767,"01:46:24,198","01:46:29,118","But it was American policy never
to negotiate with terrorists."
1768,"01:46:29,238","01:46:32,438","But somewhere,
a plan was hatched."
1769,"01:46:37,598","01:46:41,758","Reagan's Iran-Contra situation
comes down to this."
1770,"01:46:41,838","01:46:44,358","What did the president know,
and when did he know it?"
1771,"01:46:44,438","01:46:47,798","And if you, people of the press,
want any more answers,"
1772,"01:46:47,878","01:46:49,838",you ask President Reagan.
1773,"01:46:49,958","01:46:52,598","Five decades
of his struggle against us"
1774,"01:46:52,718","01:46:57,518","and it came down to whether he
could survive a domestic scandal."
1775,"01:46:57,598","01:47:01,398","In spite of the wildly
speculative and false reports,"
1776,"01:47:01,478","01:47:04,918","we do not negotiate
with terrorists"
1777,"01:47:04,998","01:47:07,238",and we did not trade arms
1778,"01:47:07,319","01:47:09,558",for hostages.
1779,"01:47:09,678","01:47:12,318","These accusations are
potentially impeachable offenses."
1780,"01:47:12,438","01:47:15,478","And if true, some observers
believe his presidency"
1781,"01:47:15,598","01:47:17,078","could be hanging
in the balance."
1782,"01:47:17,198","01:47:19,958","For W News 4 at the White
House, I'm Carl Long."
1783,"01:47:29,998","01:47:32,798","Ronnie, you have
to do something."
1784,"01:47:33,598","01:47:34,598",Have you seen this?
1785,"01:47:35,718","01:47:37,079","Yes, I've seen it."
1786,"01:47:37,158","01:47:38,798","Are you listening
to these people?"
1787,"01:47:39,558","01:47:42,238","They want nothing more
than to see you burn."
1788,"01:47:42,318","01:47:45,798","You know, they may smile and call you ""Mr.
President,"" but they hate you."
1789,"01:47:45,878","01:47:48,718","They hate what you say,
what you believe in, who you are."
1790,"01:47:48,798","01:47:50,519","Honey, I just can't accept that."
1791,"01:47:50,598","01:47:53,238","No, no, you never could."
1792,"01:47:53,318","01:47:56,198","You're the optimist. You're the one
who wants to see the good in people."
1793,"01:47:56,279","01:47:59,238","But it's my job to see
through them and protect you."
1794,"01:47:59,318","01:48:02,318","Well, that's why
we're such a good team."
1795,"01:48:04,598","01:48:08,478","Honey, you know Washington.
You know the way it works."
1796,"01:48:08,558","01:48:11,318","- It's politics, that's all.
- Ronnie, they're talking impeachment!"
1797,"01:48:11,398","01:48:15,318","- No impeachment.
- Yes, they wanna destroy you!"
1798,"01:48:15,398","01:48:18,398","They're putting you on trial,
removing you from office!"
1799,"01:48:18,478","01:48:20,318","This isn't about
politics anymore."
1800,"01:48:20,398","01:48:21,678",This is about you.
1801,"01:48:22,598","01:48:25,518","Everything is at stake.
One more headline,"
1802,"01:48:25,598","01:48:28,278","one more star witness, one more
arrest, and they will do it."
1803,"01:48:28,358","01:48:30,598",I have cooperated with them.
1804,"01:48:30,678","01:48:32,678","I appointed
a special prosecutor."
1805,"01:48:32,758","01:48:35,598","I've turned over
every document I have."
1806,"01:48:35,678","01:48:37,398",What would you have me do?
1807,"01:48:37,478","01:48:39,198",I want you to fight
1808,"01:48:39,278","01:48:41,078",or this is all over!
1809,"01:48:51,638","01:48:53,198",You could always hire someone.
1810,"01:48:53,278","01:48:54,198",Ha!
1811,"01:48:54,918","01:48:57,438","Why, you looking
for work?"
1812,"01:48:57,518","01:48:59,038",I got a job for you
1813,"01:49:00,078","01:49:01,638",back in Washington.
1814,"01:49:01,718","01:49:04,638","You're the president.
You could always order me back there."
1815,"01:49:06,558","01:49:08,998","Are they gonna impeach me, Bill?"
1816,"01:49:09,078","01:49:11,638","Well, it's moving
in that direction, sir."
1817,"01:49:13,998","01:49:16,078","Mr. President,
you're my friend."
1818,"01:49:16,158","01:49:18,358","I can only speak
to you straight."
1819,"01:49:18,438","01:49:20,918","Some laws got broken,
for sure,"
1820,"01:49:20,998","01:49:23,998","whether you broke them
or somebody else did."
1821,"01:49:24,078","01:49:27,278","So now you're clamming up
and lawyering up."
1822,"01:49:27,358","01:49:28,918",It's the wrong move.
1823,"01:49:28,998","01:49:31,118","It confuses everybody,
even the ones that love you."
1824,"01:49:32,598","01:49:34,118","People are thinking
that maybe you're..."
1825,"01:49:34,198","01:49:35,558",I'm losing it? Yeah.
1826,"01:49:36,838","01:49:37,878",I've heard it.
1827,"01:49:42,198","01:49:44,918","What do you think
I should do, Judge?"
1828,"01:49:44,998","01:49:46,478",What you do best.
1829,"01:49:46,558","01:49:47,758",Tell 'em the truth.
1830,"01:50:10,038","01:50:12,598","A few months ago,
I told the American people"
1831,"01:50:12,678","01:50:15,398","that I did not trade arms
for hostages."
1832,"01:50:15,478","01:50:19,318","My heart and my best intentions
still tell me that's true"
1833,"01:50:19,398","01:50:23,158","but the facts and the evidence
tell me it is not."
1834,"01:50:23,238","01:50:27,318","Now, what should happen
when you make a mistake is this."
1835,"01:50:27,398","01:50:30,678","You take your knocks,
you put things in perspective,"
1836,"01:50:30,758","01:50:32,918","you pull your energies together,"
1837,"01:50:32,998","01:50:35,838","you make changes,
and you go forward."
1838,"01:50:36,598","01:50:37,798",Americans.
1839,"01:50:37,878","01:50:39,718","You do them wrong,
you'll pay for it."
1840,"01:50:40,318","01:50:44,358","But look them in the eye,
admit you made a mistake,"
1841,"01:50:44,438","01:50:46,477",they forgive you every time.
1842,"01:51:00,838","01:51:02,558",He was president.
1843,"01:51:02,638","01:51:04,317",He had to know.
1844,"01:51:06,798","01:51:09,638",He was still the lifeguard.
1845,"01:51:09,718","01:51:11,958","He was going to get
his people home."
1846,"01:51:16,158","01:51:19,878","I'm not pleased with you, Ron.
Let's just get that said right up front."
1847,"01:51:20,798","01:51:22,918","Well, I can't imagine
how I've upset you, Margaret."
1848,"01:51:22,998","01:51:25,157","Are we gonna go
over Grenada again?"
1849,"01:51:25,238","01:51:27,638","Well, you're certainly
not walking away"
1850,"01:51:27,718","01:51:30,038","from what happened
at Reykjavík..."
1851,"01:51:30,118","01:51:32,198","- No.
- Looks like you're picking a fight."
1852,"01:51:32,278","01:51:35,278","No, but I'm not afraid of one."
1853,"01:51:35,358","01:51:38,678","Perhaps that is why
Mitterrand calls you"
1854,"01:51:38,758","01:51:41,158","a ""dangerous cowboy."""
1855,"01:51:42,238","01:51:43,158","Well,"
1856,"01:51:44,038","01:51:46,557","at least I have
Margaret Thatcher on my side."
1857,"01:51:51,918","01:51:54,158","- He wants to say it.
-  He does, but we'll never get it past Shultz."
1858,"01:51:54,237","01:51:56,598","I mean, it's the one thing they
don't want him talking about."
1859,"01:51:56,678","01:51:58,318","My family in Germany
is talking about it."
1860,"01:51:58,398","01:52:00,558","Everybody is talking about it.
He needs to talk about it."
1861,"01:52:00,638","01:52:02,718","He's going to Camp David,
then he's back here for a day,"
1862,"01:52:02,798","01:52:06,758","then he's going to Europe.
We have one shot to have him say this."
1863,"01:52:06,838","01:52:08,318",It's now or never.
1864,"01:52:21,638","01:52:23,758","Hey, give me this!
I-I'll take that. Thank you."
1865,"01:52:25,357","01:52:26,918","Mr. President,
some light reading."
1866,"01:52:28,397","01:52:29,638",Shh!
1867,"01:52:34,998","01:52:36,197",Good afternoon.
1868,"01:52:38,838","01:52:41,718","Hello, fellas, good day to fly."
1869,"01:52:41,798","01:52:43,197",No barrel rolls though.
1870,"01:53:21,358","01:53:23,438","Well, I think that's
a First Lady question, actually."
1871,"01:53:23,517","01:53:26,318","Why would you do this
to Gorbachev?"
1872,"01:53:26,397","01:53:28,758","You know how long it's taken us
to get to this."
1873,"01:53:28,838","01:53:30,318","They're at the table.
They're ready to make a deal"
1874,"01:53:30,398","01:53:31,998",and you wanna embarrass him?
1875,"01:53:32,078","01:53:34,798","Gorbachev's the first friend
we've had over there in 70 years!"
1876,"01:53:34,878","01:53:37,078",You can't say this.
1877,"01:53:37,158","01:53:39,678","I'm-I'm begging you
to listen to me."
1878,"01:53:39,758","01:53:43,038","You know, I stood by you
with SDI when it was ridiculed."
1879,"01:53:43,117","01:53:44,958","I supported you
with the Contras."
1880,"01:53:45,037","01:53:47,917","I even walked out of Reykjavík
with egg on my face."
1881,"01:53:47,998","01:53:50,677",But this goes too far.
1882,"01:53:50,758","01:53:52,518",This is worse than Evil Empire.
1883,"01:53:52,597","01:53:55,678","You're gonna blow up Geneva,
you blow up eight years of diplomacy."
1884,"01:53:55,757","01:53:58,158","We'll be right back
where we started from, or worse!"
1885,"01:54:01,278","01:54:03,518","""Clarity is power."""
1886,"01:54:03,598","01:54:06,678","You know, a very great man
once said that to me."
1887,"01:54:08,038","01:54:09,838","What are we here for, George..."
1888,"01:54:11,438","01:54:12,598",but to win?
1889,"01:54:20,478","01:54:23,118",Behind me stands a wall.
1890,"01:54:23,877","01:54:26,638","Part of a vast system
of barriers"
1891,"01:54:26,718","01:54:29,518","that divide the entire continent
of Europe."
1892,"01:54:29,598","01:54:33,958","A gash of barbed wire, concrete,"
1893,"01:54:34,037","01:54:36,838","dogs, and guard towers,"
1894,"01:54:36,917","01:54:40,798","imposing the will
of a totalitarian state."
1895,"01:54:41,717","01:54:43,838",As long as this gate is closed
1896,"01:54:43,918","01:54:46,678","and this scar
is permitted to stand,"
1897,"01:54:46,757","01:54:50,918","there is a question of freedom
for all mankind."
1898,"01:54:58,918","01:55:02,238","The totalitarian world
produces backwardness"
1899,"01:55:02,358","01:55:06,397","because it does such violence
to the spirit."
1900,"01:55:06,517","01:55:11,757","Thwarting the human impulse to
create, to enjoy, even to worship."
1901,"01:55:12,598","01:55:15,997","Here in Berlin,
like the city itself,"
1902,"01:55:16,078","01:55:19,758","symbols of love,
symbols of worship"
1903,"01:55:19,837","01:55:21,798",cannot be suppressed.
1904,"01:55:29,037","01:55:32,877","There is one sign
that the Soviets can make,"
1905,"01:55:32,958","01:55:36,998","that would unmistakably
and dramatically advance"
1906,"01:55:37,078","01:55:39,277",the cause of freedom and peace.
1907,"01:55:40,277","01:55:42,398","General Secretary Gorbachev,"
1908,"01:55:42,518","01:55:44,677","if you seek peace,"
1909,"01:55:44,797","01:55:48,038","if you seek liberalization
and change,"
1910,"01:55:48,158","01:55:50,397",come here to this gate.
1911,"01:55:52,597","01:55:54,838","Mr. Gorbachev,"
1912,"01:55:54,917","01:55:56,638",open this gate.
1913,"01:55:58,077","01:55:59,398",Is he gonna say it?
1914,"01:56:04,957","01:56:07,078","Mr. Gorbachev,"
1915,"01:56:07,157","01:56:09,518",tear down this wall.
1916,"01:56:15,198","01:56:16,918",Whoo!
1917,"01:56:16,997","01:56:19,718",Whoo!
1918,"01:56:29,038","01:56:30,958","Well done, cowboy."
1919,"01:57:08,197","01:57:09,957","In the chess game
of the Cold War,"
1920,"01:57:11,357","01:57:12,758",it was checkmate.
1921,"01:57:21,317","01:57:23,078","The unimaginable
is happening"
1922,"01:57:23,198","01:57:24,998",right now in Berlin.
1923,"01:57:25,118","01:57:26,478",Shocking developments overnight
1924,"01:57:26,598","01:57:28,077","as East Germany
announced its citizens"
1925,"01:57:28,197","01:57:30,277","can travel freely
to West Germany."
1926,"01:57:30,397","01:57:32,997","What no one thought
could happen"
1927,"01:57:33,117","01:57:34,878",is happening right now.
1928,"01:58:02,197","01:58:05,038","Within hours,
the city erupted in celebration"
1929,"01:58:05,158","01:58:07,518","as East and West Germans
took hammers to the wall"
1930,"01:58:07,638","01:58:09,757","that had separated them
for 30 years."
1931,"01:58:19,558","01:58:22,797","Two years,
after the wall fell,"
1932,"01:58:22,917","01:58:24,837",the Soviet Union was no more.
1933,"01:58:28,277","01:58:30,317",I knew he was the one.
1934,"01:58:31,798","01:58:34,918","He was the one
who would bring us down."
1935,"01:58:34,997","01:58:39,117","Not with missiles or guns
or even politics."
1936,"01:58:39,198","01:58:40,877",Something much greater.
1937,"01:58:46,878","01:58:50,237","People will not give
their lives for power,"
1938,"01:58:50,357","01:58:53,077","or a State, or even ideology."
1939,"01:58:54,398","01:58:57,158","People give their lives
for one another,"
1940,"01:58:58,638","01:59:02,317","for the freedom to live those
lives as they choose and for God."
1941,"01:59:06,198","01:59:07,477",We took that away.
1942,"01:59:10,077","01:59:11,197",The Crusader...
1943,"01:59:12,997","01:59:14,158",gave it back to them.
1944,"01:59:25,077","01:59:27,757","And that is the answer
to your question."
1945,"01:59:31,438","01:59:33,437","Thank you, Viktor Petrovich."
1946,"01:59:48,917","01:59:49,877",Take it.
1947,"01:59:55,718","01:59:56,678",Thank you.
1948,"01:59:58,917","02:00:00,037",Good night.
1949,"02:00:28,638","02:00:30,398","What's going on there,
Mr. President?"
1950,"02:00:33,197","02:00:35,037",This means something to me.
1951,"02:00:37,037","02:00:38,677","I know
what you're saying, John,"
1952,"02:00:39,557","02:00:41,238",but I'm not gonna do it.
1953,"02:00:41,317","02:00:43,838","Ma'am, I need you to tell him
we can't do this anymore."
1954,"02:00:43,917","02:00:46,637",I can't. I can't. I can't do it.
1955,"02:00:48,317","02:00:49,837",He got lost yesterday.
1956,"02:00:50,558","02:00:52,237","I couldn't find him
for half an hour."
1957,"02:00:53,038","02:00:55,997","Horses know when a rider doesn't
know what he's doing, okay? He's..."
1958,"02:00:57,117","02:00:58,437",He's gonna get thrown again.
1959,"02:00:59,837","02:01:02,437","I can't tell him
that he can't ride anymore."
1960,"02:01:04,757","02:01:06,237",He loves it too much.
1961,"02:01:07,957","02:01:08,917",Please.
1962,"02:01:12,557","02:01:13,517",Okay.
1963,"02:01:19,638","02:01:21,397","He loves you more, ma'am."
1964,"02:01:40,358","02:01:41,517",Mr. President?
1965,"02:01:43,997","02:01:45,357","What is it, John?"
1966,"02:01:48,397","02:01:49,437","You know, uh..."
1967,"02:01:50,877","02:01:54,037","I don't think we're having as
much fun riding as we used to."
1968,"02:01:55,117","02:01:57,238","Oh, the agent on, uh..."
1969,"02:01:57,317","02:01:59,637","- On Mrs. Reagan, she is...
- What do you want, John?"
1970,"02:02:04,557","02:02:05,917","Mr. President, I don't--"
1971,"02:02:07,157","02:02:08,957","I don't think
we should ride anymore."
1972,"02:02:11,797","02:02:12,718",Oh.
1973,"02:02:39,917","02:02:40,997",One more ride.
1974,"02:02:44,637","02:02:45,997","Yes, sir, Mr. President."
1975,"02:02:51,717","02:02:52,638",Mm.
1976,"02:03:31,237","02:03:33,238",My fellow Americans.
1977,"02:03:33,357","02:03:37,237","I have recently been told that I
am one of the millions of Americans"
1978,"02:03:37,357","02:03:40,837","who will be afflicted
with Alzheimer's disease."
1979,"02:03:40,957","02:03:43,317","At the moment,
I feel just fine."
1980,"02:03:44,437","02:03:47,917","I intend to live the remainder
of the years God gives me"
1981,"02:03:48,037","02:03:49,997","doing the things
I have always done."
1982,"02:03:51,037","02:03:54,997","Unfortunately,
as Alzheimer's disease progresses,"
1983,"02:03:55,117","02:03:58,357","the family often bears
a heavy burden."
1984,"02:03:58,477","02:04:01,758","I only wish there was some way
I could spare Nancy"
1985,"02:04:01,877","02:04:05,037",from this painful experience.
1986,"02:04:05,157","02:04:07,197","I will continue to share
life's journey"
1987,"02:04:07,317","02:04:10,517","with my beloved Nancy
and my family."
1988,"02:04:10,637","02:04:12,957","I plan to enjoy
the great outdoors"
1989,"02:04:13,077","02:04:16,397","and stay in touch with my
friends and supporters."
1990,"02:04:17,557","02:04:19,237","When the time comes,"
1991,"02:04:19,357","02:04:22,237","I am confident
that with your help,"
1992,"02:04:22,357","02:04:24,717","she will face it
with faith and courage."
1993,"02:05:28,317","02:05:32,277","In closing, let me thank you,
the American people,"
1994,"02:05:32,397","02:05:34,437",for giving me the great honor
1995,"02:05:34,557","02:05:37,077","of allowing me to serve
as your president."
1996,"02:05:37,957","02:05:42,037","When the Lord calls me home,
whenever that may be,"
1997,"02:05:42,157","02:05:45,397","I will leave with the greatest
love for this country of ours"
1998,"02:05:45,517","02:05:48,997","and eternal optimism
for its future."
1999,"02:05:49,117","02:05:53,477","I now begin the journey that will
lead me into the sunset of my life."
2000,"02:05:53,597","02:05:55,357","I know that for America,"
2001,"02:05:55,477","02:05:58,517","there will always be
a bright new dawn ahead."
2002,"02:05:59,397","02:06:01,197","Thank you, my friends."
2003,"02:06:01,317","02:06:03,197",May God always bless you.
2004,"02:06:04,717","02:06:06,037","Sincerely,"
