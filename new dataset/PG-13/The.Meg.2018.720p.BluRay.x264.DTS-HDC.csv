4,"00:01:01,335","00:01:03,468","So far

5,"00:01:03,470","00:01:05,272",It just keeps getting worse.
6,"00:01:27,461","00:01:30,861","D'Angelo, Marks,
talk to me."
7,"00:01:30,863","00:01:32,930","We've moved
to the sonar room."
8,"00:01:32,932","00:01:34,867",Just nine rescues so far.
9,"00:01:35,835","00:01:37,668","It's a mess, man."
10,"00:01:37,670","00:01:39,572","This is the worst
I've ever seen."
11,"00:01:40,274","00:01:41,275",Help!
12,"00:01:42,976","00:01:44,509",Help!

15,"00:01:53,619","00:01:55,220","I got
one more survivor."
16,"00:01:55,222","00:01:56,787","Heading back
to the rescue vehicle now."
17,"00:01:59,493","00:02:00,958",Marks. D'Angelo.
18,"00:02:00,960","00:02:02,360",What the hell was that?
19,"00:02:02,362","00:02:03,928",I have no idea.
20,"00:02:03,930","00:02:06,797",Listen.
21,"00:02:14,575","00:02:18,577","Jonas, we got
something outside the ship."
22,"00:02:18,579","00:02:20,847",There's something out there.
23,"00:02:28,388","00:02:29,389",Here.
24,"00:02:30,591","00:02:31,689","You okay, pal?"

the rescue vehicle. Now."
28,"00:02:42,469","00:02:43,836",We're right behind you.
29,"00:02:45,938","00:02:47,671","You guys, move!"
30,"00:02:47,673","00:02:49,113",Got him. Slide him up.
31,"00:02:50,444","00:02:52,511",Marks. D'Angelo. Report.
32,"00:02:52,513","00:02:53,911",You almost here?
33,"00:02:53,913","00:02:56,081","Jonas, listen to me.
We're trapped!"
34,"00:02:56,083","00:02:57,015",What?
35,"00:02:57,017","00:02:58,617",The impact jammed the hatch!
36,"00:02:58,619","00:02:59,819",Coming back.
37,"00:03:02,356","00:03:03,654","The sub

we need you down here"
40,"00:03:05,958","00:03:07,325",before it's too late.
41,"00:03:08,996","00:03:11,163",The sub's been breached.
42,"00:03:11,165","00:03:12,464",There's water everywhere.
43,"00:03:12,466","00:03:14,099","Jonas,
the room is flooding."
44,"00:03:14,101","00:03:16,901","Marks, we gotta
get this hatch open."
45,"00:03:16,903","00:03:18,470","Come on, Jonas.
Where are you?"
46,"00:03:18,472","00:03:20,138","- It's not gonna work!
- Let us out!"
47,"00:03:20,140","00:03:21,672","Jonas, hurry, please!"
48,"00:03:21,674","00:03:23,542","We just need
more time! Don't leave us!"
49,"00:03:23,544","00:03:25,544",Jonas!
50,"00:03:25,546","00:03:27,546","Let us know

52,"00:03:28,681","00:03:30,081","Jonas, please!"
53,"00:03:30,083","00:03:31,316","Come down here, now!
Where are you?"
54,"00:03:31,318","00:03:32,452",Jonas!
55,"00:03:39,892","00:03:41,061",You've lost your mind!
56,"00:03:41,827","00:03:43,028","Back off, Heller."
57,"00:03:43,030","00:03:45,397","If we go back, everyone dies."
58,"00:03:45,399","00:03:46,866",Everyone.
59,"00:03:58,945","00:04:00,380",What have you done?
60,"00:05:33,607","00:05:36,840","Are we living the dream here
or what?"
61,"00:05:36,842","00:05:39,877","Welcome to Mana One,
Mr. Morris."
62,"00:05:39,879","00:05:41,446",Get that thing away from me.
63,"00:05:41,448","00:05:42,946",What are you doing?
64,"00:05:42,948","00:05:46,785","Come on, bring it in.
There we go."
65,"00:05:46,787","00:05:48,286","Good to see you again,
Mr. Morris."
66,"00:05:48,288","00:05:49,887","- Yeah.
- This way, please."
67,"00:05:49,889","00:05:52,390","Hey, you always smell so nice.
What is that? Sandalwood?"
68,"00:05:52,392","00:05:54,958","It's impressive so far,
I'll say."
69,"00:05:54,960","00:05:56,328","Oh, here they are."
70,"00:05:56,330","00:05:58,029","Do you remember
my daughter Suyin?"
71,"00:05:58,031","00:05:59,464",Our chief marine biologist.
72,"00:05:59,466","00:06:00,765",Hi.
73,"00:06:11,911","00:06:13,111","Sorry, what was that?"
74,"00:06:13,113","00:06:15,015","- I didn't catch it.
- Uh..."
75,"00:06:16,283","00:06:18,616",She says she likes your hat.
76,"00:06:18,618","00:06:20,352","- Oh.
- Oh, yeah."
77,"00:06:20,354","00:06:21,421",Yeah.
78,"00:06:24,857","00:06:27,459","- Let's go.
- Why don't we go? Yeah."
79,"00:06:30,297","00:06:32,099","Your granddaughter's
a pistol."
80,"00:06:32,898","00:06:34,101",Okay.
81,"00:06:34,867","00:06:36,570",What have we here?
82,"00:06:38,472","00:06:40,871","This is, um,"
83,"00:06:40,873","00:06:43,241",really ugly.
84,"00:06:43,243","00:06:44,442","You know, I realize that"
85,"00:06:44,444","00:06:45,643","we're under construction
and everything,"
86,"00:06:45,645","00:06:47,078",but I really think that
87,"00:06:47,080","00:06:49,013","a world-class
research institute"
88,"00:06:49,015","00:06:51,915","deserves
a world-class entrance."
89,"00:06:51,917","00:06:54,554","Yeah, I couldn't agree more."
90,"00:06:55,689","00:06:57,255",O-Level.
91,"00:06:59,793","00:07:01,626",Whoa!
92,"00:07:01,628","00:07:03,828",Welcome to the O-Level.
93,"00:07:03,830","00:07:06,231",Nice.
94,"00:07:06,233","00:07:08,066","This is
our central hub,"
95,"00:07:08,068","00:07:10,034","from which
researchers will access"
96,"00:07:10,036","00:07:13,006","all five labs
once it's finished."
97,"00:07:14,508","00:07:15,509",Wow!
98,"00:07:17,910","00:07:19,613","Oh, look at that."
99,"00:07:22,015","00:07:24,084","That's not something
you see every day."
100,"00:07:28,355","00:07:31,389","Did you have
those whales here on cue?"
101,"00:07:31,391","00:07:35,326","I might have lured them
with some whale songs."
102,"00:07:35,328","00:07:39,332","This is Lucy
and her daughter Gracie."
103,"00:07:40,734","00:07:42,066",Incredible.
104,"00:07:44,604","00:07:45,703",Wow!

- Please."
107,"00:07:48,308","00:07:51,011","Follow me quickly.
I hope we are on time."

109,"00:07:52,479","00:07:54,614",Oh.
110,"00:07:55,282","00:07:56,347","Oh, man."
111,"00:07:56,349","00:07:58,016","I'd like you
to meet our engineer"
112,"00:07:58,018","00:07:59,784","and sub designer, Jaxx."
113,"00:07:59,786","00:08:00,951","Hey, Doc."
114,"00:08:00,953","00:08:03,121","- Hello.
- Hi."
115,"00:08:03,123","00:08:05,723","Doctor Heller.
Our medical officer."
116,"00:08:05,725","00:08:07,125",Nice to meet you.
117,"00:08:07,127","00:08:08,493","You're like Bones, huh?"
118,"00:08:08,495","00:08:11,696","DJ here pilots
our remote explorer."
119,"00:08:11,698","00:08:12,897",How's it going?
120,"00:08:12,899","00:08:14,332",You're my first billionaire.
121,"00:08:15,435","00:08:17,101","And of course, Mac,
our station chief."
122,"00:08:17,103","00:08:18,703","Mr. Morris, just in time."
123,"00:08:18,705","00:08:19,771",So I keep hearing.
124,"00:08:19,773","00:08:21,272",Try that.
125,"00:08:21,274","00:08:22,540",Just in time for what?
126,"00:08:22,542","00:08:24,476","Good morning,
Mr. Morris."
127,"00:08:24,478","00:08:26,878","Lori Taylor,
our mission pilot."
128,"00:08:26,880","00:08:28,213","Hi, Mr. Morris."
129,"00:08:28,215","00:08:29,214","Welcome on board.
It's good to have you."
130,"00:08:29,216","00:08:30,348",Hey.
131,"00:08:30,350","00:08:31,616",How's it going down there?
132,"00:08:31,618","00:08:33,651","Where'd you learn
how to pilot a sub?"
133,"00:08:33,653","00:08:35,687","I spent ten years
with a certain"
134,"00:08:35,689","00:08:37,489","whale-saving
environmental group"
135,"00:08:37,491","00:08:39,624","that shall remain unnamed
for legal reasons."
136,"00:08:39,626","00:08:41,426","Yeah, ask her
if she ever blew up"
137,"00:08:41,428","00:08:42,961","a whaling ship
with a homemade torpedo."
138,"00:08:42,963","00:08:44,028",Hey.
139,"00:08:44,030","00:08:45,163",No.
140,"00:08:47,601","00:08:49,200",That is a good hire.
141,"00:08:49,202","00:08:50,702",Eleven in two.
142,"00:08:50,704","00:08:54,472","Water temperature
is at six degrees."
143,"00:08:54,474","00:08:56,441","Mac, we are
through the thermocline."
144,"00:08:56,443","00:08:58,510","We are approaching
11,000 meters."
145,"00:08:58,512","00:09:01,181","One hundred meters
from the bottom."
146,"00:09:01,882","00:09:03,314",Maybe.
147,"00:09:03,316","00:09:05,216",Maybe from the bottom.
148,"00:09:05,218","00:09:08,052","""Maybe""? What does
he mean, ""maybe""?"
149,"00:09:08,054","00:09:10,088",Come on. Look at this.
150,"00:09:10,090","00:09:11,756","Since 1875,"
151,"00:09:11,758","00:09:14,192","we've all believed
the Mariana Trench"
152,"00:09:14,194","00:09:15,860","was the deepest place
on Earth."
153,"00:09:15,862","00:09:18,563","I've had a theory that
what we think is the bottom"
154,"00:09:18,565","00:09:21,299","might actually be a layer
of hydrogen sulfide."
155,"00:09:21,301","00:09:22,967","Beneath that cloud,"
156,"00:09:22,969","00:09:24,536","and a freezing
cold thermocline,"
157,"00:09:24,538","00:09:26,838","there could be
a completely new world."
158,"00:09:26,840","00:09:28,373",Wow!
159,"00:09:28,375","00:09:30,074","The Origin is about to see
if my father is right."
160,"00:09:30,076","00:09:31,910","If there is warm water below,"
161,"00:09:31,912","00:09:34,779","that means we're going to be
the first to see it."
162,"00:09:34,781","00:09:36,247",And what if you're wrong?
163,"00:09:36,249","00:09:39,918","Then you have wasted
$1.3 billion."
164,"00:09:42,289","00:09:43,490",You're kidding.
165,"00:09:46,226","00:09:47,725","He's kidding, right?"
166,"00:09:47,727","00:09:48,994",Copy that.
167,"00:09:48,996","00:09:50,228",Wait. What?
168,"00:09:50,230","00:09:51,765","Ten meters.
Approaching boundary."
169,"00:09:57,203","00:09:59,103",Hovering at five meters.
170,"00:09:59,105","00:10:00,204",Full stop.
171,"00:10:00,206","00:10:01,506",Final checks.
172,"00:10:01,508","00:10:02,840","- Jaxx?
- Good to go."
173,"00:10:02,842","00:10:04,142","- Doc?
- Crew are go."
174,"00:10:04,144","00:10:06,377","- DJ?
- Sub and rover are a go."
175,"00:10:06,379","00:10:07,712","Origin crew,"
176,"00:10:07,714","00:10:09,414",we are go for insertion.
177,"00:10:09,416","00:10:11,616",Insertion.
178,"00:10:11,618","00:10:13,451","Is everything sexual
with you guys?"
179,"00:10:13,453","00:10:15,853","Sex, food, power and..."
180,"00:10:15,855","00:10:17,188",Money.
181,"00:10:17,190","00:10:20,059",Blow it up now.
182,"00:10:20,061","00:10:21,292","Dive control,"
183,"00:10:21,294","00:10:24,128",we are a go for... insertion.
184,"00:10:37,577","00:10:39,078",We're in.
185,"00:10:39,080","00:10:41,346","You guys, we're in."
186,"00:10:41,348","00:10:43,414","It's a cloud.
It is not the bottom."
187,"00:10:43,416","00:10:45,450","Lori, be careful.
We don't know the depth"
188,"00:10:45,452","00:10:46,851",on the other side of this.
189,"00:10:46,853","00:10:48,353","The sea floor could come
right up on you."
190,"00:10:48,355","00:10:50,724","Copy that, Mac.
We're ready."
191,"00:11:00,233","00:11:01,833","You guys,
we are through!"
192,"00:11:01,835","00:11:04,636","I have multiple
small sonar contacts."
193,"00:11:04,638","00:11:06,471",There is life down here.
194,"00:11:06,473","00:11:07,807",Congratulations!
195,"00:11:09,242","00:11:10,510",Deploying the lights.
196,"00:11:29,763","00:11:31,865","Lights deployed.
I'm gonna come around."
197,"00:11:46,346","00:11:48,713",Whoa!
198,"00:11:48,715","00:11:51,584","Oh, my goodness."
199,"00:12:10,037","00:12:11,538","- Wow!
- Whoa!"
200,"00:12:12,706","00:12:13,871","Mac, tell me
you're getting this."
201,"00:12:13,873","00:12:15,640","We're getting
all of it, Lori."
202,"00:12:15,642","00:12:18,511","Got a lot of
smiling faces up here."
203,"00:12:23,184","00:12:25,685","DJ, we got positive terrain
to launch the rover."
204,"00:12:26,252","00:12:28,020",Copy.
205,"00:12:28,022","00:12:30,321",Launch is all yours.
206,"00:12:30,323","00:12:31,524",Okay.
207,"00:12:32,759","00:12:33,960",Rover is
208,"00:12:35,996","00:12:36,997",free.
209,"00:12:38,631","00:12:39,866",Copy.
210,"00:12:44,270","00:12:46,004",Water temperature
211,"00:12:46,006","00:12:47,674",below three degrees Celsius.
212,"00:12:55,482","00:12:57,851",How is this possible?
213,"00:12:59,385","00:13:01,953","This ecosystem
is completely cut off"
214,"00:13:01,955","00:13:03,354",from the rest of the ocean
215,"00:13:03,356","00:13:05,356","by the freezing
cold thermocline."
216,"00:13:05,358","00:13:07,759","We should find
all sorts of species"
217,"00:13:07,761","00:13:09,761",completely unknown to science.
218,"00:13:09,763","00:13:12,665",Sounds like a good investment.
219,"00:13:16,569","00:13:18,336","Lori, I have a contact."
220,"00:13:18,338","00:13:20,473",Bearing zero eight zero.
221,"00:13:22,308","00:13:24,143",Huh. It's big.
222,"00:13:24,145","00:13:25,943","Oh, it's huge."
223,"00:13:25,945","00:13:27,280",And it's moving fast.
224,"00:13:29,883","00:13:31,986","DJ,
is the rover seeing this?"
225,"00:13:33,853","00:13:34,987",Negative.
226,"00:13:34,989","00:13:36,923","Let me try
and bring up some more lights."
227,"00:13:43,197","00:13:45,296","Rover One, signal interrupted."
228,"00:13:45,298","00:13:47,298",Whoa! I just lost telemetry.
229,"00:13:47,300","00:13:48,501",What the hell?
230,"00:13:51,571","00:13:52,970","Origin, recommend"
231,"00:13:52,972","00:13:54,305","an immediate right turn
to three-five-zero."
232,"00:13:54,307","00:13:55,708",This could be a landslide.
233,"00:14:04,784","00:14:06,617","Last time I checked,
landslides don't make"
234,"00:14:06,619","00:14:08,419",90-degree turns.
235,"00:14:08,421","00:14:10,423","It's right on us!
It's right on us!"
236,"00:14:14,761","00:14:16,727",What the hell was that?
237,"00:14:18,331","00:14:19,831","Lori, what's going on
down there?"
238,"00:14:19,833","00:14:20,731",You guys...
239,"00:14:20,733","00:14:22,669","- What?
- Come look at this."
240,"00:14:24,938","00:14:25,937",Whoa!
241,"00:14:25,939","00:14:28,006","What could do that
to the rover?"
242,"00:14:28,008","00:14:30,209","I don't think
I wanna know."
243,"00:14:31,845","00:14:33,346",It's coming back.
244,"00:14:36,549","00:14:37,849","Oh, my God!"
245,"00:14:37,851","00:14:39,517","Let's get out of here.
Blow the tanks."
246,"00:14:39,519","00:14:40,785","I'm trying.
It's not working!"
247,"00:14:40,787","00:14:42,453","- It's not starting!
- Mac, help!"
248,"00:14:42,455","00:14:43,989","- Whole system's down!
- Oh, my God."
249,"00:14:43,991","00:14:46,424","Oh, my God. DJ, Mac.
There's something down here."
250,"00:14:46,426","00:14:47,792",Jonas was right.
251,"00:14:47,794","00:14:49,596",Jonas was right! Do you co...
252,"00:14:53,100","00:14:54,832","Lori, come in."
253,"00:14:54,834","00:14:56,103","Origin, can you hear me?"
254,"00:14:57,071","00:15:00,172","Origin, please respond."
255,"00:15:00,174","00:15:01,875","- Come on.
- Lori, come in."
256,"00:15:05,179","00:15:06,813","Wall, can you hear me?"
257,"00:15:09,283","00:15:11,384",Toshi?
258,"00:15:13,853","00:15:17,189","Gather around, people.
Options."
259,"00:15:17,191","00:15:18,290",Not great.
260,"00:15:18,292","00:15:19,857",We know they're alive.
261,"00:15:19,859","00:15:22,327","I've still got telemetry
on their vitals."
262,"00:15:22,329","00:15:24,162",How long do they have?
263,"00:15:24,164","00:15:25,364",Maybe 18 hours.
264,"00:15:25,366","00:15:26,564","Ballast valves
are jammed,"
265,"00:15:26,566","00:15:28,066","which means
it can't rise by itself."
266,"00:15:28,068","00:15:29,201","If we attempt to tow it,"
267,"00:15:29,203","00:15:31,535","it's fifty-fifty
that the tanks will explode,"
268,"00:15:31,537","00:15:32,970",and breach the capsule.
269,"00:15:32,972","00:15:35,040","- Can't we go hatch-to-hatch?
- Not a chance."
270,"00:15:35,042","00:15:37,642","The external camera's
showing severe hatch damage."
271,"00:15:37,644","00:15:39,144",We have to try something.
272,"00:15:39,146","00:15:40,711",They're six miles down
273,"00:15:40,713","00:15:42,880","and no one has ever attempted
a rescue at that depth."
274,"00:15:42,882","00:15:44,450","Well, that's not exactly true."
275,"00:15:45,485","00:15:47,618",No. No way.
276,"00:15:47,620","00:15:48,953",We can handle this.
277,"00:15:48,955","00:15:50,621","Not at 11,000 meters,
you can't."
278,"00:15:50,623","00:15:53,658","We've gone 5,000 meters.
8,000 meters."
279,"00:15:53,660","00:15:55,693","At some point,
it just becomes a number."
280,"00:15:55,695","00:15:57,262",Why don't you try this number?
281,"00:15:57,264","00:16:00,232","Three. That's how many people
have actually attempted"
282,"00:16:00,234","00:16:02,134","a rescue below 10,000 meters."
283,"00:16:02,136","00:16:03,935",And the number one.
284,"00:16:03,937","00:16:05,603","That's how many are left alive
to talk about it."
285,"00:16:05,605","00:16:06,904",One man. Jonas Taylor.
286,"00:16:06,906","00:16:08,639","And look what happened
to that one man"
287,"00:16:08,641","00:16:10,175","the last time he went
to these depths."
288,"00:16:10,177","00:16:11,575","He saved eleven people,"
289,"00:16:11,577","00:16:12,777","including you, Heller.
That's what happened."
290,"00:16:12,779","00:16:14,313","He left our friends to die,"
291,"00:16:14,315","00:16:16,614","because he had
pressure-induced psychosis."
292,"00:16:16,616","00:16:18,582","Come on, Heller.
That was your diagnosis."
293,"00:16:18,584","00:16:20,785","Jonas said
something attacked them."
294,"00:16:20,787","00:16:23,155","Something big enough to
take out a nuclear submarine."
295,"00:16:23,157","00:16:24,423",He's a drunk.
296,"00:16:24,425","00:16:25,890","You're not listening!
You're not listening!"
297,"00:16:25,892","00:16:27,525","He washed up on a beach
in Thailand."
298,"00:16:27,527","00:16:28,994","- Did you hear what Lori said?
- I'm listening. I heard it."
299,"00:16:28,996","00:16:30,596","- Were you there?
- That's enough."
300,"00:16:31,831","00:16:35,067","We all heard
Lori's last transmission."
301,"00:16:35,069","00:16:36,467",We have to consider
302,"00:16:36,469","00:16:37,902","that Origin may have
encountered"
303,"00:16:37,904","00:16:40,504","something similar to what
Jonas Taylor described."
304,"00:16:40,506","00:16:42,707","Something he was able
to escape from."
305,"00:16:42,709","00:16:44,909",Ba! Please.
306,"00:16:45,912","00:16:47,678",Prep the helicopter.
307,"00:16:47,680","00:16:49,916",We must go to Thailand.
308,"00:17:25,918","00:17:27,219","Your boat,"
309,"00:17:27,221","00:17:29,054",she's killing me.
310,"00:17:29,056","00:17:31,256","Number one engine
slips out of the gear,"
311,"00:17:31,258","00:17:32,757","and there's some leak
in the hydraulics."
312,"00:17:32,759","00:17:34,426","Hey, I'll take a look
at it tonight."
313,"00:17:34,428","00:17:35,659","That's what you said
last night"
314,"00:17:35,661","00:17:36,894","and the night before that,"
315,"00:17:36,896","00:17:38,763",and the night before that.
316,"00:17:38,765","00:17:39,930","Hey, I'm working up to it."
317,"00:17:39,932","00:17:41,699",You drink too much.
318,"00:17:41,701","00:17:43,035","Hey, now
you're only saying that"
319,"00:17:43,037","00:17:46,038","because I literally have
a beer in my hand."
320,"00:17:46,040","00:17:48,739","You always have beer
in your hand."
321,"00:17:48,741","00:17:49,977",You know why?
322,"00:17:50,877","00:17:52,743",Because I drink too much?
323,"00:18:15,536","00:18:19,204","Now this is shaping up to be
an eventful Tuesday evening."
324,"00:18:19,206","00:18:21,506","You know
I like to make an entrance."
325,"00:18:21,508","00:18:22,873","Hell, Mac, after five years,"
326,"00:18:22,875","00:18:24,675","just showing up
is making an entrance."
327,"00:18:24,677","00:18:26,844","What? You're living
above a bar? Really?"
328,"00:18:26,846","00:18:28,926","Figured it was the only way
to get you to come visit."
329,"00:18:32,685","00:18:34,252","Jonas,
allow me to introduce..."
330,"00:18:34,254","00:18:35,920","It's an honor to meet you,
Doctor Zhang."
331,"00:18:35,922","00:18:38,756","Always had a tremendous
respect for your work."
332,"00:18:38,758","00:18:40,192","You're too kind, Mr. Taylor."
333,"00:18:40,194","00:18:42,160","Yeah, no, I'm not.
You're a good man."
334,"00:18:42,162","00:18:44,695","Hey, can I offer
either of you two a beer?"
335,"00:18:44,697","00:18:47,099",'Cause I'm gonna have a beer.
336,"00:18:47,101","00:18:49,034","It's not a social call, Jonas."
337,"00:18:49,036","00:18:52,170","You mean you didn't helicopter
in just to say ""hi""?"
338,"00:18:52,172","00:18:54,972","You wound me, Mac."
339,"00:18:54,974","00:18:57,775","- We have a serious...
- Problem?"
340,"00:18:57,777","00:18:59,511",Thought so.
341,"00:18:59,513","00:19:01,379",Just like you know
342,"00:19:01,381","00:19:03,614",I don't dive anymore.
343,"00:19:03,616","00:19:04,849","Done being responsible
for people, Mac."
344,"00:19:04,851","00:19:06,151",Mr. Taylor...
345,"00:19:06,153","00:19:07,852","Hey, I mean no offense,
Doctor Zhang."
346,"00:19:07,854","00:19:09,920","I mean, if there was
two people on this planet"
347,"00:19:09,922","00:19:11,722","that could get me
back into the water,"
348,"00:19:11,724","00:19:13,757",it's probably you two.
349,"00:19:13,759","00:19:15,160",But you can't.
350,"00:19:15,162","00:19:18,363","You're gonna tell me your
problem, and I'll say no."
351,"00:19:18,365","00:19:20,232",You're gonna offer me money.
352,"00:19:20,234","00:19:21,366",I'll still say no.
353,"00:19:21,368","00:19:23,968","You're gonna appeal
to my better nature,"
354,"00:19:23,970","00:19:25,604",and I'm gonna say no.
355,"00:19:25,606","00:19:27,606",Because I don't have one.
356,"00:19:27,608","00:19:30,674","So I say,
why don't we sit down?"
357,"00:19:30,676","00:19:32,310","We'll enjoy a couple of beers,"
358,"00:19:32,312","00:19:34,146","and then we can
get you on your way."
359,"00:19:35,549","00:19:37,748",Jonas.
360,"00:19:37,750","00:19:40,918",This happened this morning.
361,"00:19:40,920","00:19:43,188","Let's get out
of here. Blow the tanks!"
362,"00:19:43,190","00:19:44,788","I'm trying.
It's not working!"
363,"00:19:44,790","00:19:46,124","It's not starting!
Whole system's down!"
364,"00:19:46,126","00:19:47,993","Mac, help!
Oh, my God. Oh, my God."
365,"00:19:47,995","00:19:50,794","DJ, Mac.
There's something down here."
366,"00:19:50,796","00:19:51,997",Jonas was right.
367,"00:19:51,999","00:19:53,298","Jonas was right!
Do you co..."
368,"00:19:54,368","00:19:55,900",It's Lori.
369,"00:19:55,902","00:19:58,336","Your ex-wife
and her crew are trapped"
370,"00:19:58,338","00:20:00,771","below 11,000 meters."
371,"00:20:00,773","00:20:02,174","I fear they may
have encountered"
372,"00:20:02,176","00:20:04,576","the same species
you did down there."
373,"00:20:04,578","00:20:08,313","I have divers with less
experience willing to go."
374,"00:20:08,315","00:20:10,282","But I feel
I owe it to my crew"
375,"00:20:10,284","00:20:14,021","to give this rescue
the best chance of success."
376,"00:20:16,089","00:20:17,924",Please.
377,"00:20:25,898","00:20:27,934","Lori,
hand me that hexa key."
378,"00:20:29,102","00:20:30,137",Thanks.
379,"00:20:34,575","00:20:35,839",Oh.
380,"00:20:35,841","00:20:38,176",Okay.
381,"00:20:38,178","00:20:39,611","Okay, if we can
short out the firewall,"
382,"00:20:39,613","00:20:41,747","I can... I can probably
reboot the computers."
383,"00:20:44,585","00:20:46,752",Okay. Try it now.
384,"00:20:51,558","00:20:53,759",Auxiliary power's back.
385,"00:20:56,997","00:20:59,097",Heaters are online.
386,"00:20:59,099","00:21:00,632","There's no way that we'll
get the engine started,"
387,"00:21:00,634","00:21:03,435","but we might be able
to get the ballast tanks back."
388,"00:21:04,904","00:21:06,504","What are you doing?
Taking notes?"
389,"00:21:06,506","00:21:08,342",Letter to my wife.
390,"00:21:11,445","00:21:12,912",Just in case.
391,"00:21:13,714","00:21:14,912",Hey.
392,"00:21:14,914","00:21:16,648",We got this.
393,"00:21:16,650","00:21:18,916",Step by step.
394,"00:21:18,918","00:21:21,921","Come on. Give me
that fighting octopus."
395,"00:21:32,099","00:21:33,632",See?
396,"00:21:33,634","00:21:35,168",Works every time.
397,"00:21:41,708","00:21:43,408",No.
398,"00:21:43,410","00:21:45,909","- What?
- We gotta can the lights."
399,"00:22:06,133","00:22:08,600",Turn out the lights.
400,"00:22:08,602","00:22:10,302","There was
something down there with us."
401,"00:22:10,304","00:22:11,503","How can you be
sure if there were"
402,"00:22:11,505","00:22:13,605","no observation windows
on your craft?"
403,"00:22:13,607","00:22:15,307",'Cause whatever it was
404,"00:22:15,309","00:22:18,610","caved in the entire starboard
side of a nuclear submarine."
405,"00:22:18,612","00:22:20,111",That wasn't my imagination.
406,"00:22:20,113","00:22:22,380","Is that why
you blew the hatch mid-rescue?"
407,"00:22:22,382","00:22:25,949","Hey, look, I brought 11 men
back safe and sound."
408,"00:22:25,951","00:22:27,552","You left
eight more to die"
409,"00:22:27,554","00:22:28,720",because you panicked.
410,"00:22:28,722","00:22:31,056","If I hadn't blown the hatch,"
411,"00:22:31,058","00:22:33,224","we all would have been
killed by that thing."
412,"00:22:33,226","00:22:34,526",There was no thing.
413,"00:22:34,528","00:22:36,027","There was no evidence
of anything."
414,"00:22:36,029","00:22:37,295","Because
it was destroyed"
415,"00:22:37,297","00:22:38,862","in the explosion, Heller."
416,"00:22:38,864","00:22:42,067","Look, there was no time left!
So I made the call!"
417,"00:22:42,069","00:22:43,967","And you left
our friends there to die"
418,"00:22:43,969","00:22:46,206",in an act of cowardice!
419,"00:22:48,375","00:22:50,908","What do you think
happened down there?"
420,"00:22:50,910","00:22:52,444",He lost it.
421,"00:22:52,446","00:22:54,212","And now we're
about to send him"
422,"00:22:54,214","00:22:56,348",into the exact same situation.
423,"00:22:57,818","00:22:59,150","Excuse me, Suyin."
424,"00:22:59,152","00:23:01,119","I'm sorry to interrupt you,
but we need you."
425,"00:23:01,121","00:23:02,589",It's an emergency.
426,"00:23:03,824","00:23:05,856","What's wrong, Jaxx?"
427,"00:23:05,858","00:23:07,225",Now they're leaking oxygen.
428,"00:23:07,227","00:23:09,096","They've got a couple of hours.
Maybe more."
429,"00:23:10,997","00:23:12,530","- I'm going.
- No."
430,"00:23:12,532","00:23:13,732","Wait, what?"
431,"00:23:13,734","00:23:15,667","I'll take one of the gliders,
grab the Origin,"
432,"00:23:15,669","00:23:17,335","- and tow her up.
- Wait!"
433,"00:23:17,337","00:23:19,618","If the Origin's ballast tanks
blow, you're gonna die, too."
434,"00:23:20,107","00:23:22,109",We have to try.
435,"00:23:24,944","00:23:26,646",Mummy?
436,"00:23:29,349","00:23:31,082",Meiying.
437,"00:23:35,355","00:23:36,423",Um...
438,"00:23:46,899","00:23:48,268",Uh...
439,"00:24:09,489","00:24:11,124",Communications check!
440,"00:24:14,694","00:24:16,094",Good to go.
441,"00:24:16,096","00:24:19,564","Suyin, you are go for launch."
442,"00:24:19,566","00:24:21,006",Richard Byrd.
443,"00:24:42,522","00:24:45,292","Auto descent
sequence initiated."
444,"00:24:47,894","00:24:50,063","- Hey, Meiying.
- Hi."
445,"00:25:19,392","00:25:22,260","- Sir, we've got a new problem.
- It's your daughter."
446,"00:25:22,262","00:25:24,329","She took a glider
to try and save them."
447,"00:25:24,331","00:25:25,663",Why did you let her go?
448,"00:25:25,665","00:25:28,132","Trust me,
I didn't let her do anything."
449,"00:25:28,134","00:25:29,567","I was sort of
under the impression"
450,"00:25:29,569","00:25:31,135","you're supposed to try
to save people"
451,"00:25:31,137","00:25:32,003","who are dying
on the bottom of the ocean."
452,"00:25:32,005","00:25:33,271",Who's he?
453,"00:25:33,273","00:25:35,242","I'm the guy
who paid for all this."
454,"00:25:36,443","00:25:37,809",Uh-huh.
455,"00:25:37,811","00:25:40,178","You know, he looks heroic
and he walks fast,"
456,"00:25:40,180","00:25:43,283","but he's kind of
got a negative attitude."
457,"00:25:46,988","00:25:48,253",What's the window?
458,"00:25:48,255","00:25:50,156",It'll be close.
459,"00:25:52,025","00:25:53,291",Who are you?
460,"00:25:53,293","00:25:54,526","I'm the one
that designed all this."
461,"00:25:54,528","00:25:56,394",So my life's in your hands?
462,"00:25:56,396","00:25:59,531",Pretty much. That a problem?
463,"00:25:59,533","00:26:00,465",Nah.
464,"00:26:00,467","00:26:01,666",You look like you might
465,"00:26:01,668","00:26:03,668","actually know
what you're doing."
466,"00:26:03,670","00:26:05,870",Dive control level.
467,"00:26:05,872","00:26:07,405","Oh, I'm sorry."
468,"00:26:07,407","00:26:10,808","Mac, have Doctor Heller
meet us in the medical bay."
469,"00:26:10,810","00:26:12,011",Heller?
470,"00:26:12,013","00:26:14,045",Did I not mention that?
471,"00:26:14,047","00:26:15,482",You mother...
472,"00:26:20,420","00:26:21,786",He's in perfect shape.
473,"00:26:21,788","00:26:23,723","Just like the last time
you examined me."
474,"00:26:25,825","00:26:28,426","Suyin took a glider
15 minutes ago."
475,"00:26:28,428","00:26:30,061","She's planning
on taking the Origin back up."
476,"00:26:30,063","00:26:31,362",Take me to the sub.
477,"00:26:31,364","00:26:33,431","- We're not done here.
- Yeah, we are."
478,"00:26:33,433","00:26:34,666","Lori's running out of air,"
479,"00:26:34,668","00:26:36,167","and we're in
international waters,"
480,"00:26:36,169","00:26:37,502",which means legally
481,"00:26:37,504","00:26:39,337","I can beat the ever-loving
shit out of you"
482,"00:26:39,339","00:26:41,274",and get away with it.
483,"00:26:42,709","00:26:44,142",It's true.
484,"00:26:44,144","00:26:45,378","Legally, I mean."
485,"00:26:46,646","00:26:48,715","Good thing
he doesn't hold a grudge."
486,"00:26:49,382","00:26:50,782","Jonas, you do know"
487,"00:26:50,784","00:26:52,584","that this sub is rated
for 12,000 meters, right?"
488,"00:26:52,586","00:26:54,752","Like the one leaking
on the ocean floor?"
489,"00:26:54,754","00:26:57,022",Ah. Good point.
490,"00:26:57,024","00:26:58,556","- We good?
- Yep."
491,"00:26:58,558","00:27:00,025","Once you strip back
the safeties"
492,"00:27:00,027","00:27:02,594","and go full manual,
like I know you're gonna do,"
493,"00:27:02,596","00:27:03,996","the system's gonna
have problems"
494,"00:27:03,998","00:27:06,497","trying to keep up
with your pressure changes."
495,"00:27:06,499","00:27:08,199","Try not to blow
your ears out, brother."
496,"00:27:08,201","00:27:10,270","Thanks, mate."
497,"00:27:23,850","00:27:26,184","Hello, skipper."
498,"00:27:26,186","00:27:28,121",You must be the crazy guy.
499,"00:27:28,922","00:27:30,755",Now who called me that?
500,"00:27:30,757","00:27:32,559",My mom. Doctor Heller.
501,"00:27:33,560","00:27:36,227","Yeah, well, I'm not crazy."
502,"00:27:36,229","00:27:38,463","I've just seen things
no one else has."
503,"00:27:38,465","00:27:41,100","That's the definition
of crazy."
504,"00:27:43,903","00:27:47,140",Backup power. Backup power...
505,"00:27:52,013","00:27:53,645",So where are your parents?
506,"00:27:53,647","00:27:56,381","My mom's trying
to bring our friends back"
507,"00:27:56,383","00:27:58,683",from the bottom of the ocean.
508,"00:27:58,685","00:28:02,687","My dad's with a Pilates
instructor in Taipei."
509,"00:28:02,689","00:28:05,456","Granddad says
Mom needs to move on,"
510,"00:28:05,458","00:28:07,358","but Mom says
she needs some more time"
511,"00:28:07,360","00:28:09,427","because she was
married to an a-hole."
512,"00:28:09,429","00:28:11,431","Sounds like
your mom's got a point."
513,"00:28:15,869","00:28:17,635",You know a lot.
514,"00:28:17,637","00:28:20,173","Eight-year-olds
hear everything."
515,"00:28:21,908","00:28:23,877",Mind if I give it a try?
516,"00:28:26,279","00:28:28,248",Bye.
517,"00:28:33,253","00:28:34,487","Hey, Crazy."
518,"00:28:35,855","00:28:38,790",Is my mom gonna die?
519,"00:28:38,792","00:28:42,094","I'll have Captain Bubbles
and your mom back in no time."
520,"00:28:42,096","00:28:44,197",I promise.
521,"00:28:49,202","00:28:50,802","Thank you, Emma."
522,"00:28:50,804","00:28:52,503","Evolution
launch in T-minus 15 seconds."
523,"00:28:52,505","00:28:54,073","- DJ?
- Yeah."
524,"00:28:54,075","00:28:56,274","Jaxx, we good?"
525,"00:28:56,276","00:28:57,709",Doc?
526,"00:28:57,711","00:28:59,877","Evolution,"
527,"00:28:59,879","00:29:01,247",we are go for dive.
528,"00:29:04,417","00:29:05,785",Fancy.
529,"00:29:13,493","00:29:16,863",System go for descent.

531,"00:29:21,735","00:29:24,169","Hey, brother.
We're good to go."
532,"00:29:24,171","00:29:25,572",System go for descent.
533,"00:29:29,076","00:29:31,943",System go for descent.

536,"00:29:45,226","00:29:48,693",Evolution successful launch.
537,"00:29:55,769","00:29:59,006","Evolution now passing
1,000 meters."
538,"00:30:02,842","00:30:06,511","Caution. Evolution
secondary systems offline."
539,"00:30:06,513","00:30:09,047",How is he descending so fast?
540,"00:30:09,049","00:30:11,516","Looks like he's diverted
all nonessential power"
541,"00:30:11,518","00:30:13,518","like heat and life support
to the motors."
542,"00:30:13,520","00:30:14,919",He's gonna black out.
543,"00:30:18,092","00:30:20,060",His blood gases are dropping.
544,"00:30:22,129","00:30:23,461",Jonas.
545,"00:30:23,463","00:30:24,964","Tell Heller
I'm not slowing down."
546,"00:30:35,341","00:30:36,474","Suyin, be advised."
547,"00:30:36,476","00:30:37,809",Evolution is now en route.
548,"00:30:37,811","00:30:39,443","Request you return
to Mana One immediately."
549,"00:30:39,445","00:30:40,678",Negative.
550,"00:30:40,680","00:30:42,547","He can give us
an escort on our way up."
551,"00:30:42,549","00:30:44,515","Tell her to get
out of the way, Mac."
552,"00:30:44,517","00:30:45,950",More people means more risk
553,"00:30:45,952","00:30:47,385","and she's in
way over her head."
554,"00:30:47,387","00:30:49,823","Jonas, you just
told her yourself."
555,"00:30:51,324","00:30:52,623",What?
556,"00:30:52,625","00:30:54,059","The little green button
on your intercom,"
557,"00:30:54,061","00:30:56,030","that's for single channel
communication."
558,"00:30:56,963","00:30:58,731",Brilliant.
559,"00:31:07,074","00:31:08,942",Entering thermocline.
560,"00:31:19,886","00:31:21,220","Okay, Mac."
561,"00:31:21,222","00:31:22,956",I am through.
562,"00:31:24,657","00:31:25,957",Warning.
563,"00:31:25,959","00:31:28,994","Pressure load
approaching 16,000 psi."
564,"00:31:28,996","00:31:30,229","At this speed,"
565,"00:31:30,231","00:31:31,796","I'm gonna have to divert
power from the heaters"
566,"00:31:31,798","00:31:33,478","and shut down anything
that could ice over."
567,"00:31:34,534","00:31:35,835",Call you from the other side.
568,"00:31:39,439","00:31:42,341",You got Wi-Fi here?
569,"00:31:42,343","00:31:43,776",All right.
570,"00:31:44,577","00:31:45,910",Okay.
571,"00:31:45,912","00:31:47,778","Just... Just keep
pressure on that."
572,"00:31:47,780","00:31:49,447","Toshi, is it still out there?"
573,"00:31:49,449","00:31:50,882",I can't tell.
574,"00:31:50,884","00:31:52,752","I can't see anything
right now."
575,"00:32:27,187","00:32:28,552",Oh.
576,"00:32:28,554","00:32:30,821",There it is.
577,"00:32:30,823","00:32:32,291","I've got visual
on the Origin."
578,"00:32:32,293","00:32:33,457",I can see most of it.
579,"00:32:33,459","00:32:35,294",Okay. They're alive.
580,"00:32:35,296","00:32:36,863",I'm going to set up to tow.
581,"00:32:40,100","00:32:43,368",Range to target. Six meters.
582,"00:32:43,370","00:32:44,502",Four meters.

586,"00:33:07,894","00:33:10,062","Suyin? Are you okay?
What's happening?"
587,"00:33:10,064","00:33:12,863","There is something
down here."
588,"00:33:12,865","00:33:15,635",Something just hit my ship.
589,"00:33:29,882","00:33:31,682","Suyin, what's happening?"
590,"00:33:31,684","00:33:33,151",It's a huge squid.
591,"00:33:33,153","00:33:34,585",It's got the glider.
592,"00:33:34,587","00:33:36,154","Warning.
Capsule pressure."
593,"00:33:36,156","00:33:39,157","Mac, it's crushing me.
It's crushing me!"
594,"00:33:39,159","00:33:40,825","I don't think
the glider can take it."
595,"00:33:40,827","00:33:42,427",It's not gonna hold.
596,"00:33:44,731","00:33:47,698","Suyin, engage
the pressure compensator."
597,"00:33:47,700","00:33:50,135","Compensator
will not engage."
598,"00:33:50,137","00:33:52,006",Capsule breach in ten seconds.
599,"00:33:55,275","00:33:57,075",Capsule breach in five sec...
600,"00:34:16,096","00:34:18,232",My God!
601,"00:34:21,035","00:34:22,434",It's a shark.
602,"00:34:22,436","00:34:24,635","It's like 20, 25 meters."
603,"00:34:24,637","00:34:26,138",It's a megalodon.
604,"00:34:26,140","00:34:27,807",Impossible.
605,"00:34:29,977","00:34:32,578",I'm so glad I'm not crazy.
606,"00:34:37,550","00:34:39,217","Suyin, power down."
607,"00:34:39,219","00:34:40,651",It's drawn to the light.
608,"00:34:40,653","00:34:42,920","Shut everything down
and stay dark."
609,"00:34:42,922","00:34:44,722",Shutdown in 30 seconds.
610,"00:34:44,724","00:34:46,124","Shutting off
everything but comms."
611,"00:34:46,126","00:34:47,591",It's circling back.
612,"00:34:47,593","00:34:48,959","Here it comes, Suyin."
613,"00:34:48,961","00:34:50,795",Shutdown in 25 seconds.
614,"00:34:50,797","00:34:52,431","Suyin, there's no time."
615,"00:34:52,433","00:34:53,731",Turn off your lights.
616,"00:34:53,733","00:34:55,833",Shutdown in 20 seconds.
617,"00:34:55,835","00:34:58,036",Turn them off. Now.
618,"00:34:58,038","00:34:59,770",Shutdown in 15 seconds.
619,"00:34:59,772","00:35:01,141","Mac, I have no control."
620,"00:35:03,077","00:35:04,142",Hurry.
621,"00:35:04,144","00:35:06,178","Ten, nine,"
622,"00:35:06,180","00:35:07,711","eight, seven,"
623,"00:35:07,713","00:35:10,050","six, five..."
624,"00:35:29,936","00:35:31,602","Now's your chance.
Blow your tanks."
625,"00:35:31,604","00:35:34,172","No. I can help you
save the crew."
626,"00:35:34,174","00:35:36,874","Your glider's damaged.
There's nothing you can do."
627,"00:35:36,876","00:35:38,878",Blow your tanks now.
628,"00:35:39,712","00:35:41,048",Damn it.
629,"00:35:48,322","00:35:49,687","Doctor Zhang,"
630,"00:35:49,689","00:35:51,389",your daughter's clear.
631,"00:35:51,391","00:35:54,294","I'm heading
for the Origin now."
632,"00:36:00,234","00:36:02,735",Range to target: three meters.
633,"00:36:12,146","00:36:14,114",Water extraction complete.
634,"00:36:23,090","00:36:25,425","Let's do this, sweetheart."
635,"00:36:46,980","00:36:49,916","Tell me this isn't the world's
best ""I told you so."""
636,"00:36:50,651","00:36:51,882",You came all the way here
637,"00:36:51,884","00:36:53,218","just to tell me that,
didn't you?"
638,"00:36:53,220","00:36:55,187",Pretty much.
639,"00:36:55,189","00:36:57,457",Give me your hand.
640,"00:37:01,995","00:37:04,563","Ah, that doesn't look good.
Ready? One, two, three."
641,"00:37:07,534","00:37:09,401",She's coming.
642,"00:37:09,403","00:37:11,735",Let's move.
643,"00:37:11,737","00:37:14,406","If that thing hits us
while we're still attached..."
644,"00:37:14,408","00:37:16,276",Then we're all gonna die.
645,"00:37:23,617","00:37:24,884","Come on, I've got you."
646,"00:37:25,952","00:37:27,519",It's gonna be close.
647,"00:37:27,521","00:37:29,256","Come on, move, move!"
648,"00:37:31,458","00:37:33,124",Go! Go! Go!
649,"00:37:33,126","00:37:35,427","We're not
gonna make it."
650,"00:37:35,429","00:37:37,364","- Come on.
- Toshi, hurry!"
651,"00:37:38,498","00:37:39,765","Toshi, no!"
652,"00:38:09,962","00:38:11,265","Come in, Evolution."
653,"00:38:12,633","00:38:14,534","Jonas, come in."
654,"00:38:15,935","00:38:18,205",Are you all okay?
655,"00:38:21,108","00:38:23,475","Doctor Heller has vitals
on Lori and The Wall,"
656,"00:38:23,477","00:38:25,512",but we don't have Toshi.
657,"00:38:26,313","00:38:27,481",Is Toshi okay?
658,"00:38:28,948","00:38:31,318","Jonas, is Toshi okay?"
659,"00:38:32,653","00:38:34,019","- All right.
- Nice and easy."
660,"00:38:34,021","00:38:35,487",Yeah. Yep.
661,"00:38:35,489","00:38:37,022","- Don't move her neck.
- Careful."
662,"00:38:37,024","00:38:39,993","That's good.
Grab a hold. We got her."
663,"00:38:51,405","00:38:53,837","You couldn't bring
Toshi back?"
664,"00:38:53,839","00:38:56,576","- Why not?
- He closed the hatch."
665,"00:38:58,412","00:38:59,912",He saved us.
666,"00:39:00,946","00:39:02,549",You left him.
667,"00:39:04,917","00:39:07,385","You left him
because that's who you are."
668,"00:39:07,387","00:39:09,820","You are the guy
who leaves people behind."
669,"00:39:09,822","00:39:11,489","You go that deep,"
670,"00:39:11,491","00:39:13,358","you take your life
in your hands."
671,"00:39:13,360","00:39:16,263","It was your choice
to send them down."
672,"00:39:20,667","00:39:23,503","This is why
I don't do this anymore, Mac."
673,"00:39:35,749","00:39:36,949",How is she?
674,"00:39:39,586","00:39:41,852","Well, the puncture
just missed her liver."
675,"00:39:41,854","00:39:43,488",She lost a lot of blood.
676,"00:39:43,490","00:39:45,025",But she's stable.
677,"00:39:52,799","00:39:54,000",Jonas.
678,"00:39:56,969","00:39:58,405",I'm sorry.
679,"00:39:59,506","00:40:01,108",I was wrong.
680,"00:40:03,710","00:40:05,245","You save Lori,"
681,"00:40:06,213","00:40:08,014",we can call it even.
682,"00:40:35,242","00:40:37,575","I just want to apologize
for before."
683,"00:40:37,577","00:40:39,978","I was angry
and I lose my temper."
684,"00:40:39,980","00:40:41,448",And you did save my...
685,"00:40:43,550","00:40:44,551",You're naked.
686,"00:40:49,156","00:40:54,060","I know you did all you could.
So, thank you."
687,"00:40:54,694","00:40:56,161",Yeah.
688,"00:40:56,163","00:40:58,396",You're welcome.
689,"00:40:58,398","00:41:02,102","I know it's not easy
being the person who survives."
690,"00:41:03,969","00:41:05,837",I'm gonna go now.
691,"00:41:05,839","00:41:06,970","You should
put on some clothes."
692,"00:41:06,972","00:41:09,274",Yep. That's the original plan.
693,"00:41:09,276","00:41:11,411","Okay, then. Carry on."
694,"00:41:31,264","00:41:34,065",Hi. Uh... I was...
695,"00:41:34,067","00:41:35,469",It's all good.
696,"00:41:37,137","00:41:39,771","Jonas and Lori were the worst
married couple ever, you know?"
697,"00:41:39,773","00:41:40,971",Uh-huh.
698,"00:41:40,973","00:41:43,243","Whole experiment
was over in a year."
699,"00:41:44,644","00:41:46,513",I didn't ask anything.
700,"00:41:47,481","00:41:49,149",I know.
701,"00:41:54,588","00:41:58,022","This is what
attacked us. A megalodon."
702,"00:41:58,024","00:42:00,191",How big is that thing?
703,"00:42:00,193","00:42:04,329","Between 70 and 90 feet.
21 to 27 meters."
704,"00:42:04,331","00:42:08,233","The megalodon was the largest
shark that ever existed."
705,"00:42:08,235","00:42:10,134",It feared nothing.
706,"00:42:10,136","00:42:12,770",It had no predators.
707,"00:42:12,772","00:42:16,274","Its jaws were stronger
than any other animal, ever."
708,"00:42:16,276","00:42:19,143","The meg could bite
a whale in half,"
709,"00:42:19,145","00:42:20,912",crushing through the bones.
710,"00:42:20,914","00:42:22,947","We are
in uncharted territory."
711,"00:42:22,949","00:42:24,349",Until today
712,"00:42:24,351","00:42:26,751","megalodons were thought
to have been extinct"
713,"00:42:26,753","00:42:28,319",for over two million years.
714,"00:42:28,321","00:42:30,655","- Wrong.
- A living fossil."
715,"00:42:30,657","00:42:33,627","That living fossil
ate my friend."
716,"00:42:35,328","00:42:37,195","I cannot begin
to express"
717,"00:42:37,197","00:42:39,063",my sadness for Toshi's death.
718,"00:42:39,065","00:42:41,132","We have the discovery
of a lifetime."
719,"00:42:41,134","00:42:43,603",This is what Toshi worked for.
720,"00:42:45,472","00:42:47,272","It's what
we've all worked for."
721,"00:42:47,274","00:42:50,775","But we're going
to have to proceed slowly."
722,"00:42:50,777","00:42:53,580","Yeah, that's really
not gonna work for me."
723,"00:42:56,182","00:42:58,351",What is Mana One?
724,"00:42:59,085","00:43:00,385",This station?
725,"00:43:00,387","00:43:02,355",Yes. And what's it doing?
726,"00:43:03,223","00:43:05,292",Hmm? Right now.
727,"00:43:07,661","00:43:08,960",Exactly.
728,"00:43:08,962","00:43:10,962",Nothing.
729,"00:43:10,964","00:43:12,564","20 million dollar rover, gone."
730,"00:43:12,566","00:43:15,433","Thirty million dollar sub,
gone."
731,"00:43:15,435","00:43:17,435","You are now sitting
in the most expensive"
732,"00:43:17,437","00:43:20,171","underwater marine
biology day camp"
733,"00:43:20,173","00:43:21,974",in human history.
734,"00:43:21,976","00:43:24,242","Hey, Crazy."
735,"00:43:24,244","00:43:25,677","And now that
we've actually"
736,"00:43:25,679","00:43:27,280","found something amazing,"
737,"00:43:28,049","00:43:30,281",we can't proceed slowly.
738,"00:43:30,283","00:43:33,451","Thank you
for keeping your promise."
739,"00:43:33,453","00:43:35,054","- You're welcome.
- You don't quit"
740,"00:43:35,056","00:43:37,322","trying to get to the Moon
because you lose an astronaut."
741,"00:43:37,324","00:43:38,756","You charge forward,"
742,"00:43:38,758","00:43:41,826","or someone else
will get there first."
743,"00:43:41,828","00:43:45,129","Other people will want
a piece of this thing,"
744,"00:43:45,131","00:43:47,532",whether we like it or not.
745,"00:43:47,534","00:43:49,202",You seem to like it.
746,"00:43:50,604","00:43:54,639","- Excuse me?
- I said, you seem to like it."
747,"00:43:54,641","00:43:57,208","I'm sorry.
Is he part of this team?"
748,"00:43:57,210","00:43:59,611","You're damn right
he's a part of this team."
749,"00:43:59,613","00:44:01,479",Okay.
750,"00:44:01,481","00:44:02,947","You ever think
that Mother Nature"
751,"00:44:02,949","00:44:05,516",might know what she's doing?
752,"00:44:05,518","00:44:10,421","The thermocline might
just be there for a reason?"
753,"00:44:10,423","00:44:15,193","Hey, look, you wanna explore?
Go ahead, explore."
754,"00:44:15,195","00:44:18,296","But if you start sending
people back down there,"
755,"00:44:18,298","00:44:20,832","don't call me
to come save your asses."
756,"00:44:20,834","00:44:22,433","Because in case what happened
down there"
757,"00:44:22,435","00:44:24,402","wasn't clear to you,"
758,"00:44:24,404","00:44:27,338",man vs. meg isn't a fight.
759,"00:44:27,340","00:44:28,642",It's a slaughter.
760,"00:44:43,289","00:44:45,456",O-Level.
761,"00:45:24,999","00:45:27,832","What you people discovered
is an even bigger goldmine"
762,"00:45:27,834","00:45:30,102","than we ever thought
possible."
763,"00:45:30,104","00:45:31,869",We are completely unprepared
764,"00:45:31,871","00:45:33,571","to deal with creatures
like megalodon."
765,"00:45:33,573","00:45:35,239","I understand,
and we can get prepared."
766,"00:45:35,241","00:45:37,142","I'm talking about
a long-term plan."
767,"00:46:30,930","00:46:32,730","That's gonna be
the other alternative."
768,"00:46:35,268","00:46:36,569",What's that?
769,"00:46:40,907","00:46:42,009",My daughter.
770,"00:46:51,484","00:46:52,917",Jonas.
771,"00:46:52,919","00:46:54,186","- Did you see Meiying?
- We can't find Meiying."
772,"00:46:54,188","00:46:56,921",Meiying? Meiying?
773,"00:46:56,923","00:46:58,603","- I'll take this way.
- Let's try this way."
774,"00:47:05,166","00:47:06,366",Meiying.
775,"00:47:06,933","00:47:07,934",Meiying?
776,"00:47:09,636","00:47:11,504","- Meiying.
- Mama."
777,"00:47:13,973","00:47:15,974",Are you okay?
778,"00:47:15,976","00:47:20,112","There's a monster
and it's watching us."
779,"00:47:39,766","00:47:41,634","It's okay.
It's just a whale."
780,"00:47:42,802","00:47:44,537",Wait. Where's Lucy?
781,"00:47:46,040","00:47:48,173",Where's the mom?
782,"00:48:00,854","00:48:03,788","Is the station all right?
Report."
783,"00:48:03,790","00:48:05,489",No leaks. No visible damage.
784,"00:48:05,491","00:48:08,392","All right, team.
Initiate emergency protocols."
785,"00:48:08,394","00:48:09,861","And nobody is to go
near the water."
786,"00:48:09,863","00:48:10,862",If you insist.
787,"00:48:10,864","00:48:12,697","Turn off
all the underwater lighting."
788,"00:48:12,699","00:48:14,732","Restrict the crew
to essential areas."
789,"00:48:14,734","00:48:17,368","You said it was impossible
for it to get up here."
790,"00:48:17,370","00:48:18,936",It should have been.
791,"00:48:18,938","00:48:20,738","You guys,
take a look at this."
792,"00:48:20,740","00:48:23,075","When the glider came up,
the thermocline was intact,"
793,"00:48:23,077","00:48:25,210","so it was
one degree Celsius, right?"
794,"00:48:25,212","00:48:26,744",Yeah.
795,"00:48:26,746","00:48:28,913","But a minute later,
when the Evolution came up,"
796,"00:48:28,915","00:48:31,016","the temperature increased
by 25 degrees."
797,"00:48:31,018","00:48:33,384","A shark could come
right through there."
798,"00:48:33,386","00:48:35,620",20 sharks for that matter.
799,"00:48:35,622","00:48:36,821","When the meg hit the Origin,"
800,"00:48:36,823","00:48:38,290","it slammed into
a thermal vent."
801,"00:48:38,292","00:48:40,858","Those can release millions
of gallons per minute."
802,"00:48:40,860","00:48:42,927","The heat from that vent
cleared the path"
803,"00:48:42,929","00:48:44,662","through the freezing
cold layer."
804,"00:48:44,664","00:48:45,863",Are you saying we opened up
805,"00:48:45,865","00:48:47,366","a super highway
for giant sharks?"
806,"00:48:47,368","00:48:50,534","Not exactly. It seems like
it was a transitory event."
807,"00:48:50,536","00:48:51,769","The temperatures
are returned to normal"
808,"00:48:51,771","00:48:53,404",and the gap is closed.
809,"00:48:53,406","00:48:56,574","Yeah. But not before a massive
prehistoric killing machine"
810,"00:48:56,576","00:48:58,076","decided to come up
and say ""Hi."""
811,"00:48:58,078","00:49:00,478","Hey, look, we're wasting time.
That thing's out there."
812,"00:49:00,480","00:49:01,948","We need to find it
and kill it."
813,"00:49:02,383","00:49:03,881",No.
814,"00:49:03,883","00:49:08,353","We can't. We should explore
non-lethal options first."
815,"00:49:08,355","00:49:10,122",For the meg or for us?
816,"00:49:11,858","00:49:13,058",Attention.
817,"00:49:13,060","00:49:15,426","I've got
an emergency locator beacon."
818,"00:49:15,428","00:49:17,095","20 miles south, southwest."
819,"00:49:17,097","00:49:18,297",What does that mean?
820,"00:49:18,299","00:49:19,797","It means
a boat has gone down."
821,"00:49:19,799","00:49:21,632","- Attention.
- Three boats."
822,"00:49:21,634","00:49:25,538","That's the meg.
We need to get there. Now."
823,"00:49:40,453","00:49:43,090",Mac! I found something!
824,"00:50:01,541","00:50:03,375",These sharks have no fins.
825,"00:50:03,377","00:50:05,843","They were killed
by shark poachers."
826,"00:50:05,845","00:50:08,715","They cut off the fins and
throw the shark back to die."
827,"00:50:09,782","00:50:12,550",All for a bowl of soup.
828,"00:50:12,552","00:50:14,221","Looks like the meg
evened the score."
829,"00:50:19,525","00:50:20,960",One fish did all this?
830,"00:50:22,196","00:50:23,696",Ask it yourself.
831,"00:50:26,566","00:50:27,965",Okay.
832,"00:50:27,967","00:50:30,601","We have a shark cage
and spearguns on board."
833,"00:50:30,603","00:50:32,237",If we can shoot the meg
834,"00:50:32,239","00:50:34,006","in a soft spot
like it's mouth or gills,"
835,"00:50:34,008","00:50:36,108","we can inject it
with something lethal."
836,"00:50:36,110","00:50:37,376","Whoa! Whoa, whoa."
837,"00:50:37,378","00:50:39,111","It's gonna take at least
20 minutes to rig the cage."
838,"00:50:39,113","00:50:40,811","And that thing
will be gone in two."
839,"00:50:40,813","00:50:42,548","Why don't you just
put a tracker on it?"
840,"00:50:44,884","00:50:46,550","Don't you guys
ever watch Shark Week?"
841,"00:50:46,552","00:50:51,356","You have one of those, like,
GPS tracker tag thingamajigs."
842,"00:50:51,358","00:50:53,325","Keep an eye on the shark
till the cage is ready."
843,"00:50:53,327","00:50:55,293","We should be able
to put a tracking dart"
844,"00:50:55,295","00:50:56,428",in that dorsal fin.
845,"00:50:56,430","00:50:57,528",You're welcome.
846,"00:50:57,530","00:50:59,164","Yeah, but somehow"
847,"00:50:59,166","00:51:00,731","we have to get this boat
next to that meg."
848,"00:51:00,733","00:51:02,401","No, we can't."
849,"00:51:02,403","00:51:05,137","It's already proven
aggressive towards boats."
850,"00:51:05,139","00:51:07,472","The safest way to approach
is without a vehicle."
851,"00:51:07,474","00:51:08,639",Hold up. Hold up.
852,"00:51:08,641","00:51:10,142","You want someone
to swim out there?"
853,"00:51:10,144","00:51:12,810","To a prehistoric shark
that ate our friend?"
854,"00:51:12,812","00:51:15,280","Actually, one of us alone
in the water is no threat."
855,"00:51:15,282","00:51:17,917","Okay, who the hell
is gonna make that swim?"
856,"00:51:20,120","00:51:21,353",Let's draw straws.
857,"00:51:21,355","00:51:22,922",I can't swim.
858,"00:51:25,558","00:51:26,791",Uh...
859,"00:51:26,793","00:51:29,862","Sorry, my body
made me say that."
860,"00:51:31,198","00:51:33,133",You sure about this?
861,"00:51:35,536","00:51:38,336",Not really.
862,"00:51:38,338","00:51:41,041","If I get eaten,
you're gonna feel really bad."
863,"00:51:47,014","00:51:50,284","This tracker rifle
only has a 100-foot range."
864,"00:51:51,018","00:51:52,150",100 feet?
865,"00:51:52,152","00:51:54,054","Get really close
before you shoot."
866,"00:51:55,055","00:51:56,620",Great.
867,"00:51:56,622","00:51:58,722","If you want me
to go instead, I will."
868,"00:51:58,724","00:52:00,559","I got this, Mac."
869,"00:52:00,561","00:52:02,360","Okay, good,
'cause I was lying."
870,"00:52:02,362","00:52:03,661",Be safe.
871,"00:52:03,663","00:52:05,165","Yeah, thanks, pal."
872,"00:52:08,235","00:52:10,204","I hope you're right
about this."
873,"00:52:11,138","00:52:12,372","Me, too."
874,"00:52:24,351","00:52:26,053",I'm an idiot.
875,"00:52:37,897","00:52:41,566","I am proceeding to
the enormous killer shark."
876,"00:52:41,568","00:52:43,335","Yeah, we got you, Jonas."
877,"00:52:43,337","00:52:46,371","Sharks are
attracted to panic motion."
878,"00:52:46,373","00:52:48,175",Keep it nice and smooth.
879,"00:52:58,519","00:53:00,387",It's all gonna be fine.
880,"00:53:06,792","00:53:09,060",♪ Just keep swimming
881,"00:53:09,062","00:53:11,662",♪ Just keep swimming
882,"00:53:11,664","00:53:14,032","♪ Swimming, swimming"
883,"00:53:14,034","00:53:16,170",♪ Just keep swimming
884,"00:53:22,176","00:53:24,877","Oh, boy,
it's going under."
885,"00:54:24,371","00:54:25,570",He's done it.
886,"00:54:25,572","00:54:27,205","Mac, tracker is live!"
887,"00:54:27,207","00:54:28,475","Great!
Reel him in, DJ."
888,"00:54:35,515","00:54:36,581",Stop! Stop!
889,"00:54:36,583","00:54:38,352",No vibration!
890,"00:54:40,153","00:54:42,721","Oh, shit. I'm in trouble."
891,"00:54:42,723","00:54:44,089","Jonas, it's coming at you."
892,"00:54:44,091","00:54:46,725",You think I didn't notice?
893,"00:54:46,727","00:54:48,195","Start the boat!
Start the boat!"
894,"00:54:54,468","00:54:56,236",Pull him in.
895,"00:55:12,286","00:55:14,521","- Come on! Come on!
- Come on!"
896,"00:55:33,040","00:55:35,140","You might be
a son of a bitch,"
897,"00:55:35,142","00:55:37,010","but you're sure as hell
no coward."
898,"00:55:37,477","00:55:38,809",Good job.
899,"00:55:54,127","00:55:57,996","I prepared the spearheads
to inject etorphine."
900,"00:55:57,998","00:56:00,864","A killer whale is knocked
out with 10 CCs."
901,"00:56:00,866","00:56:03,501","Dead with 20.
What do you think?"
902,"00:56:03,503","00:56:06,239","I think we use
the whole damn bottle."
903,"00:56:07,641","00:56:10,908","Remind me again
why this is a good idea."
904,"00:56:10,910","00:56:13,178","What?
It's a shark cage."
905,"00:56:13,180","00:56:15,180",Plastic shark cage.
906,"00:56:15,182","00:56:17,649","I'm gonna ignore
that you just said that."
907,"00:56:17,651","00:56:20,085","This beautiful thing
is polycarbonate,"
908,"00:56:20,087","00:56:22,721","specifically designed
not to crack,"
909,"00:56:22,723","00:56:25,256","not to break, but to deform."
910,"00:56:25,258","00:56:27,225","And in this case,
at this thickness,"
911,"00:56:27,227","00:56:31,096","it would take 20,000 pounds
per square inch."
912,"00:56:31,098","00:56:33,098","And if you're talking
about breaking,"
913,"00:56:33,100","00:56:35,635","that's eight to nine
hundred thousand."
914,"00:56:39,106","00:56:40,507",I don't like it.
915,"00:56:44,845","00:56:46,511",Doesn't like it.
916,"00:56:46,513","00:56:48,215",I wouldn't get in there.
917,"00:56:50,050","00:56:51,284",Keep it coming.
918,"00:56:55,355","00:56:57,023",That's good!
919,"00:57:04,631","00:57:05,665",Hey.
920,"00:57:06,700","00:57:09,000",What did he say?
921,"00:57:09,002","00:57:10,835","He said, ""be careful."""
922,"00:57:10,837","00:57:13,138","That's his version
of I love you."
923,"00:57:13,140","00:57:14,938","Your father has
a lot of faith in you."
924,"00:57:14,940","00:57:18,111","I've done
hundreds of shark dives."
925,"00:57:19,746","00:57:21,914",Not like this.
926,"00:57:22,449","00:57:23,583",Yes.
927,"00:57:24,284","00:57:26,317",But I know shark anatomy.
928,"00:57:26,319","00:57:27,951",And I know where this
929,"00:57:27,953","00:57:30,624","can penetrate through
megalodon skin."
930,"00:57:33,193","00:57:35,727","- Suyin, let me go instead...
- Hey."
931,"00:57:35,729","00:57:38,665","Don't worry about me.
Let me do what I do best."
932,"00:58:25,111","00:58:26,678",Everything okay up there?
933,"00:58:26,680","00:58:29,314","Just a fresh
round of chum,"
934,"00:58:29,316","00:58:32,317","so you,
you know, taste good."
935,"00:58:32,319","00:58:34,986","I'm so glad
you're looking out for me."
936,"00:58:34,988","00:58:37,491","Thank you.
Bye-bye. Good luck."
937,"00:59:03,617","00:59:05,116","What's happening
down there?"
938,"00:59:05,118","00:59:06,684",You okay?
939,"00:59:06,686","00:59:08,753",Yeah. I'm okay.
940,"00:59:08,755","00:59:12,325","Just some teeny,
tiny eight-foot sharks."
941,"00:59:19,165","00:59:21,599",Here we go.
942,"00:59:23,270","00:59:24,702",We've got her attention.
943,"00:59:24,704","00:59:26,504","Suyin, it's on its way."
944,"00:59:26,506","00:59:28,074","- 50 meters.
- 50 meters."
945,"00:59:31,044","00:59:32,312",30.
946,"00:59:34,114","00:59:35,213",10 meters.
947,"00:59:53,300","00:59:54,501",Okay.
948,"00:59:56,003","00:59:58,303",Wow.
949,"00:59:58,305","01:00:00,707","I'm going to try
to hit it in the eye."
950,"01:00:03,044","01:00:04,578",Damn it.
951,"01:00:16,356","01:00:17,922",Whoa! Watch it.
952,"01:00:17,924","01:00:19,225",Whoa! Hey!
953,"01:00:29,569","01:00:31,504","Oh, sh..."
954,"01:00:39,512","01:00:42,047","Yes!
The poison is in."
955,"01:00:42,049","01:00:44,517","Okay, Suyin,
hang in there."
956,"01:00:47,821","01:00:50,321","I'm trapped!
I'm in its mouth!"
957,"01:00:50,323","01:00:51,956",That cage will not break.
958,"01:00:51,958","01:00:55,328","That's the problem.
The cage is being swallowed."
959,"01:01:09,043","01:01:10,575","Hell, yeah!"
960,"01:01:21,187","01:01:23,590","- Not this again.
- Oh, man. Oh, man."
961,"01:01:50,051","01:01:54,187","New problem. My mask
is broken. I'm losing air."
962,"01:02:01,261","01:02:02,796",Help!
963,"01:02:06,199","01:02:07,400",Help!
964,"01:02:12,472","01:02:14,274","Come on, Jaxx!"
965,"01:02:18,712","01:02:21,247","- Thank you.
- You're welcome."
966,"01:02:26,753","01:02:28,087","No, Jonas."
967,"01:02:28,089","01:02:30,390",Go! Get back to the ship.
968,"01:02:31,158","01:02:32,859",It's not safe for you.
969,"01:02:35,462","01:02:37,764","Jonas, go back."
970,"01:02:38,765","01:02:39,866",Jonas.
971,"01:02:49,876","01:02:52,111","Jonas,
the crane's in the water!"
972,"01:02:52,113","01:02:54,414","It's gonna pull her
to the bottom. Hurry!"
973,"01:02:58,052","01:02:59,985",Swing the second crane over.

1015,"01:07:02,895","01:07:06,897","Look, remember the bite marks
on the O-Level?"
1016,"01:07:06,899","01:07:08,699","Well, how do you like that?"
1017,"01:07:08,701","01:07:11,569","That was a serious
man vs. nature moment."
1018,"01:07:11,571","01:07:13,840","I'm just glad
things went our way."
1019,"01:07:14,707","01:07:16,609",It didn't go our way.
1020,"01:07:17,610","01:07:19,146",Not for Toshi.
1021,"01:07:20,481","01:07:22,682",And not for science.

1032,"01:08:25,979","01:08:27,680",Nobody said there were two.
1033,"01:08:28,549","01:08:30,515",How are there two?

racist stuff on me."

1042,"01:08:44,131","01:08:45,796","Give me a break.
I'm not being racist."
1043,"01:08:45,798","01:08:50,168","You work, literally,
in the middle of the ocean."
1044,"01:08:50,170","01:08:52,070","This wasn't
part of the job description."
1045,"01:08:52,072","01:08:54,539","None of this was part
of the job description!"
1046,"01:08:54,541","01:08:56,176",They left that part out!
1047,"01:09:07,653","01:09:08,919","It's time
to get some real help."
1048,"01:09:08,921","01:09:10,621",Yeah. Go get some help.
1049,"01:09:13,227","01:09:14,526",I'm quitting.
1050,"01:09:14,528","01:09:17,030",Mac! Give me a hand.
1051,"01:09:21,901","01:09:25,003","Hey, I need you
to find my location."
1052,"01:09:25,005","01:09:27,539","Track my sat phone.
There's a second shark."
1053,"01:09:27,541","01:09:29,107","Yes, two."
1054,"01:09:29,109","01:09:30,741",How the hell should I know?
1055,"01:09:30,743","01:09:32,843","Just hurry up
and get us some help."
1056,"01:09:32,845","01:09:33,979","Thank you, Jonas. Thank you."
1057,"01:09:33,981","01:09:35,247","Bring whatever
you got!"
1058,"01:09:35,249","01:09:37,382",Just relax. Relax.
1059,"01:09:37,384","01:09:38,949",It's not good.
1060,"01:09:38,951","01:09:40,818",He needs a hospital fast.
1061,"01:09:40,820","01:09:43,255","Let's get the doctor.
Where's Doctor Heller?"
1062,"01:09:44,657","01:09:45,858",Jaxx?
1063,"01:09:46,627","01:09:48,627","Jaxx, you okay?"
1064,"01:09:48,629","01:09:50,863",Yeah! Kind of.
1065,"01:09:53,400","01:09:54,832",Jaxx...
1066,"01:09:54,834","01:09:56,667",We can do this.
1067,"01:09:56,669","01:09:58,338",Swim gently back to the boat.
1068,"01:09:58,938","01:10:00,840",Nice and easy.
1069,"01:10:05,912","01:10:07,646",Here it comes!
1070,"01:10:07,648","01:10:08,915",Heller!
1071,"01:10:09,583","01:10:11,218",We're not gonna make it.
1072,"01:10:12,586","01:10:13,884",Jaxx.
1073,"01:10:13,886","01:10:15,287",You're gonna be okay.
1074,"01:10:15,289","01:10:18,192","- You're a good person, Jaxx.
- Wait, what?"
1075,"01:10:18,891","01:10:20,358",Don't look back.
1076,"01:10:20,360","01:10:21,759","- Hey!
- No!"
1077,"01:10:21,761","01:10:22,860","Heller, no!"
1078,"01:10:22,862","01:10:24,296","- What are you doing?
- Hey!"
1079,"01:10:24,298","01:10:26,031","Hey, come on!"
1080,"01:10:26,033","01:10:29,102","Hey! Hey, come on!"
1081,"01:10:29,702","01:10:30,903",Hey!
1082,"01:10:33,407","01:10:35,242",Heller!
1083,"01:10:44,518","01:10:46,750",Almost there.
1084,"01:10:46,752","01:10:49,189","- Come on.
- We got you."
1085,"01:10:51,924","01:10:54,825","It's okay, Jaxx."
1086,"01:10:54,827","01:10:56,396",You're gonna be okay.
1087,"01:11:03,736","01:11:08,340","Thank you, Heller, thank you."
1088,"01:11:08,342","01:11:11,009","What was that?
What the hell was that?"
1089,"01:11:11,011","01:11:13,178","- Okay, come on, DJ.
- No! No!"
1090,"01:11:13,180","01:11:15,146","This is why we don't
leave the station, okay?"
1091,"01:11:15,148","01:11:16,982",That's why you don't do that!
1092,"01:11:16,984","01:11:19,384","And you went down there
and you pissed it off,"
1093,"01:11:19,386","01:11:22,153","now it's gonna come back
and kill every one of us!"
1094,"01:11:22,155","01:11:23,622","Now what are we
supposed to do?"
1095,"01:11:23,624","01:11:25,357","I shouldn't even be out here
in the first place."
1096,"01:11:25,359","01:11:28,226","Swimming in this ocean.
That one ate the other one."
1097,"01:11:28,228","01:11:30,295","Is another one
gonna eat this one?"
1098,"01:11:30,297","01:11:32,199","Man, it's..."
1099,"01:11:33,400","01:11:35,300",It just killed Heller.
1100,"01:11:35,302","01:11:38,438","It killed The Wall.
It killed Toshi."
1101,"01:11:40,806","01:11:43,010","These are my friends, man."
1102,"01:11:51,917","01:11:53,118","Okay,
can I just point out"
1103,"01:11:53,120","01:11:54,519",that this thing is sinking?
1104,"01:11:54,521","01:11:55,819",What are we gonna do now?
1105,"01:11:55,821","01:11:57,057",Where's Mac?
1106,"01:12:12,172","01:12:13,173",Yes!
1107,"01:12:27,688","01:12:29,654",What happened to your hair?
1108,"01:12:29,656","01:12:30,991",What happened to your hair?
1109,"01:12:31,857","01:12:33,126",Touche.
1110,"01:12:34,860","01:12:36,096",Guys!
1111,"01:12:38,864","01:12:40,267",That thing is the devil.
1112,"01:12:41,301","01:12:43,501","10 miles, it's still with us."
1113,"01:12:43,503","01:12:45,170",You got us?
1114,"01:12:45,172","01:12:47,339","The ocean. The middle
of a freaking ocean!"
1115,"01:12:47,341","01:12:48,807","Do you think
it'd slow down the shark"
1116,"01:12:48,809","01:12:51,144",if we threw him over?
1117,"01:12:52,212","01:12:54,679",You got to work on yourself.
1118,"01:12:54,681","01:12:55,913","Okay. Good news, guys."
1119,"01:12:55,915","01:12:57,351",It's payback time.
1120,"01:12:58,985","01:13:00,953","Oh, yeah!"
1121,"01:13:33,387","01:13:34,819",Yes! Get some!
1122,"01:13:34,821","01:13:36,554","You seriously think
that a rifle"
1123,"01:13:36,556","01:13:37,555",is gonna hurt that thing?
1124,"01:13:37,557","01:13:39,457","I didn't have
much notice, okay?"
1125,"01:13:39,459","01:13:41,995","I just wanted to get it
off our backs."
1126,"01:13:42,796","01:13:43,995","Well done, Morris."
1127,"01:13:43,997","01:13:45,298",Whoo!
1128,"01:15:35,175","01:15:36,307",It's okay.
1129,"01:15:36,309","01:15:38,678",Mummy! Mummy!
1130,"01:15:39,880","01:15:42,082","Welcome back, Mummy."
1131,"01:16:31,032","01:16:32,332",Come in.
1132,"01:16:38,238","01:16:39,673",How's Meiying?
1133,"01:16:41,141","01:16:43,074",She's sad.
1134,"01:16:43,076","01:16:45,445",And confused.
1135,"01:16:46,780","01:16:48,248",How are you?
1136,"01:16:50,051","01:16:52,819","I really don't want
to accept it."
1137,"01:16:55,555","01:17:00,358","Sometimes things happen
that change your life forever."
1138,"01:17:00,360","01:17:02,995","Meanwhile,
the world just keeps going."
1139,"01:17:02,997","01:17:07,400","You think maybe it would stop
just for a second..."
1140,"01:17:09,903","01:17:11,769",But it doesn't.
1141,"01:17:11,771","01:17:13,640",How do you live with it?
1142,"01:17:15,042","01:17:16,276",I don't.
1143,"01:17:17,243","01:17:20,945","I left my two best friends
to die."
1144,"01:17:20,947","01:17:23,848","I think about it
all the time."
1145,"01:17:23,850","01:17:25,652",Every day I replay it.
1146,"01:17:26,886","01:17:29,554",Could I have done more?
1147,"01:17:29,556","01:17:32,592","It's not just about
the ones you lose."
1148,"01:17:34,494","01:17:38,565","It's also about
the ones you save."
1149,"01:17:43,803","01:17:45,605",I'm glad you're here.
1150,"01:17:57,751","01:18:00,718","I've informed the Chinese
government about the meg."
1151,"01:18:00,720","01:18:03,521","As well as the authorities
in Thailand,"
1152,"01:18:03,523","01:18:05,823","Vietnam, Indonesia,
and Australia."
1153,"01:18:05,825","01:18:09,995","The Chinese are sending
two destroyers to take it out."
1154,"01:18:09,997","01:18:12,430","So, this is now officially"
1155,"01:18:12,432","01:18:15,201","and thankfully
out of our hands."
1156,"01:18:17,904","01:18:19,506",I'm closing Mana One
1157,"01:18:20,440","01:18:22,807",until the meg is killed
1158,"01:18:22,809","01:18:27,178","and an evacuation ship is
coming here tomorrow morning."
1159,"01:18:27,180","01:18:28,746",You damn right.
1160,"01:18:28,748","01:18:31,551","And finally,
I just want to say"
1161,"01:18:36,157","01:18:39,859",I'm sorry for your losses.
1162,"01:18:41,028","01:18:42,829",Your friends.
1163,"01:18:44,597","01:18:47,267","I came here
to celebrate with you,"
1164,"01:18:49,636","01:18:51,771",and now I'm mourning with you.
1165,"01:19:05,685","01:19:07,587",Thanks for saving our asses.
1166,"01:19:16,930","01:19:18,863",What do you got for me?
1167,"01:19:18,865","01:19:21,866","These are Semtex high velocity
demolition charges."
1168,"01:19:21,868","01:19:24,969","I had the men rig delay fuses
to give them time to sink."
1169,"01:19:24,971","01:19:27,540","Essentially,
they're depth charges."
1170,"01:19:29,375","01:19:30,908",That's right.
1171,"01:19:30,910","01:19:34,245","I'm not sure this is
a advisable course of action."
1172,"01:19:34,247","01:19:37,615","Every person that gets maimed
or killed by that thing"
1173,"01:19:37,617","01:19:39,017",is a potential lawsuit.
1174,"01:19:39,019","01:19:40,520",A potential casualty.
1175,"01:19:41,888","01:19:44,756","Relax, bro.
It's gonna be fun."
1176,"01:19:48,394","01:19:51,763","- I can see your cards.
- Well, look at you two crooks."
1177,"01:19:51,765","01:19:52,998",Hey.
1178,"01:19:53,000","01:19:54,932",How are you feeling?
1179,"01:19:54,934","01:19:55,967","Like I got off easy,"
1180,"01:19:55,969","01:19:57,437","compared to
the rest of you guys."
1181,"01:19:58,072","01:19:59,305",Mmm.
1182,"01:20:00,007","01:20:01,472",What do you got up there?
1183,"01:20:01,474","01:20:02,673",Three kings.
1184,"01:20:02,675","01:20:05,943",What? Come on! Every time.
1185,"01:20:05,945","01:20:08,113","You owe me
a soda for that one."
1186,"01:20:08,115","01:20:09,914",Fine.
1187,"01:20:09,916","01:20:12,050","We'll square up
when you get back, okay?"
1188,"01:20:12,052","01:20:14,819",Fine. Fine. Fine.
1189,"01:20:14,821","01:20:16,854","Just trying to take her mind
off things, you know."
1190,"01:20:16,856","01:20:18,892","She's tougher than me,
that's for sure."
1191,"01:20:22,762","01:20:24,829","I'm sorry
I didn't believe you."
1192,"01:20:24,831","01:20:27,365","Well, you didn't
call me crazy."
1193,"01:20:27,367","01:20:29,168","Yeah, but I didn't
call you sane."
1194,"01:20:29,170","01:20:32,472","Yeah, well, ""sane"" wasn't
a word I heard very often."
1195,"01:20:34,474","01:20:36,141","So, what now?"
1196,"01:20:36,143","01:20:38,876","I don't know.
Go back to Thailand, I guess."
1197,"01:20:38,878","01:20:40,945","Mac told me
about you and Suyin."
1198,"01:20:40,947","01:20:44,782","- Nothing to tell.
- Well, maybe there could be."
1199,"01:20:44,784","01:20:46,084",You and Mac are unbelievable.
1200,"01:20:46,086","01:20:49,054","How about you just
try something new?"
1201,"01:20:49,056","01:20:51,389","So the rest of your life
isn't a vast wasteland"
1202,"01:20:51,391","01:20:54,159",of misery and solitude.
1203,"01:20:54,161","01:20:56,561",I think that's a good idea.
1204,"01:20:56,563","01:20:57,895","You do, huh?"
1205,"01:20:57,897","01:20:59,764","Eight-year-olds
hear everything."
1206,"01:20:59,766","01:21:01,968",Jonas...
1207,"01:21:05,572","01:21:07,907","My mom likes you, too."
1208,"01:21:12,478","01:21:15,615","This is possibly
the worst moment of my life."
1209,"01:21:18,551","01:21:20,185",Approaching target area.
1210,"01:21:20,187","01:21:21,588",I'll confirm visual.
1211,"01:21:23,823","01:21:26,058","Let me make myself
absolutely clear."
1212,"01:21:26,060","01:21:28,693","We are not getting within
a mile of that monster"
1213,"01:21:28,695","01:21:30,728",until the helicopter kills it.
1214,"01:21:30,730","01:21:32,864","We have a visual
on the target."
1215,"01:21:32,866","01:21:34,398",Stop the boat.
1216,"01:21:34,400","01:21:35,602",Stop the boat.
1217,"01:21:38,504","01:21:40,440","Deploying
depth charges."
1218,"01:21:54,387","01:21:55,655",We got him.
1219,"01:21:57,258","01:21:58,589",Hit it again.
1220,"01:21:58,591","01:21:59,657","Sir,
there's no way possible..."
1221,"01:21:59,659","01:22:00,860",Hit it again.
1222,"01:22:07,334","01:22:10,601","Target is dead.
Repeat, target is dead."
1223,"01:22:10,603","01:22:12,204",Are you absolutely sure?
1224,"01:22:12,206","01:22:13,372",Because I'm not getting eaten
1225,"01:22:13,374","01:22:15,107","by some goddamn
prehistoric fish."
1226,"01:22:15,109","01:22:17,675","Affirmative, sir.
There's, uh..."
1227,"01:22:17,677","01:22:20,444","Well, there's pieces of it
all over the place."
1228,"01:22:20,446","01:22:22,546",Shark chunks?
1229,"01:22:22,548","01:22:24,249",That's a good sign.
1230,"01:22:24,251","01:22:27,021",All right. Take us in.
1231,"01:22:34,460","01:22:35,994",Oh!
1232,"01:22:35,996","01:22:38,063","Jump down there,
get me a couple of teeth."
1233,"01:22:38,065","01:22:39,131",Big ones for my desk.
1234,"01:22:39,133","01:22:41,201","- All right.
- Keep one for yourself."
1235,"01:22:42,169","01:22:43,770",Nice.
1236,"01:22:46,739","01:22:48,208","Oh, you seeing this?"
1237,"01:22:49,609","01:22:50,843",Crazy.
1238,"01:22:56,050","01:22:57,850",That's sick.
1239,"01:23:03,190","01:23:04,557",That's weird.
1240,"01:23:09,896","01:23:12,630","Oh, man!
Don't do that to me."
1241,"01:23:12,632","01:23:14,532","That thing
doesn't have any teeth."
1242,"01:23:14,534","01:23:16,168",What?
1243,"01:23:16,170","01:23:17,737",I think we killed a whale.
1244,"01:23:20,807","01:23:22,608",It's right below us.
1245,"01:23:23,509","01:23:24,777",Get us outta here!
1246,"01:23:29,849","01:23:32,317","Wait! Wait,
you idiots! Wait!"
1247,"01:23:32,319","01:23:34,254",I'm over here! Wait!
1248,"01:23:36,656","01:23:38,958","Oh, no!"
1249,"01:23:59,446","01:24:00,747",Oh!
1250,"01:24:12,925","01:24:16,529","Yeah, I understand.
I understand, yep. Thank you."
1251,"01:24:18,399","01:24:20,765","Let me guess,
Morris never called anyone."
1252,"01:24:20,767","01:24:22,034",Didn't call anyone.
1253,"01:24:22,036","01:24:23,701","No one knows
the shark's out there."
1254,"01:24:23,703","01:24:25,504","No one. Not the Australians,"
1255,"01:24:25,506","01:24:26,837",not the Chinese. No one.
1256,"01:24:26,839","01:24:28,340",The hell was he thinking?
1257,"01:24:28,342","01:24:30,775","He wanted to make this go away
as quietly as possible."
1258,"01:24:30,777","01:24:31,942","Mac, we need
to let everyone..."
1259,"01:24:31,944","01:24:33,345","Let everyone know.
Yeah, I'm on it."
1260,"01:24:33,347","01:24:34,845","Jaxx, can you find that thing?"
1261,"01:24:34,847","01:24:36,481","Wait, wait, wait.
Why're you asking her that?"
1262,"01:24:36,483","01:24:38,803","I don't like the fact that you
asking her about that thing."
1263,"01:24:39,752","01:24:41,119","You want me
to illegally hack"
1264,"01:24:41,121","01:24:42,920","into Morris' satellite
tracking system"
1265,"01:24:42,922","01:24:45,457","- to find a prehistoric shark?
- Yeah."
1266,"01:24:45,459","01:24:46,957",Okay.
1267,"01:24:46,959","01:24:49,394","We use a tracker,
find the meg, and we kill it."
1268,"01:24:49,396","01:24:50,596",Bro.
1269,"01:24:52,632","01:24:54,032",We really gonna do this?
1270,"01:24:54,034","01:24:55,933","A lot of people are gonna die
if we don't, Mac."
1271,"01:24:55,935","01:24:57,436","- Well, I'm in.
- Me, too."
1272,"01:24:57,438","01:24:59,204",Let's do this.
1273,"01:24:59,206","01:25:01,639","How do you feel about
commandeering that evac ship?"
1274,"01:25:01,641","01:25:03,808","I'd say,"
1275,"01:25:03,810","01:25:05,645","it's a great day
to go fishing."
1276,"01:25:06,779","01:25:07,979","Now let's get
everything on it."
1277,"01:25:07,981","01:25:09,947","Construction explosives,
gliders."
1278,"01:25:09,949","01:25:11,349",The whole lot. Everything.
1279,"01:25:11,351","01:25:13,385","Because we're about
to evac, right?"
1280,"01:25:13,387","01:25:14,685",Like evacuate?
1281,"01:25:14,687","01:25:16,854","Like, leave the area
of imminent danger"
1282,"01:25:16,856","01:25:20,827","and go to a safe place
like normal people?"
1283,"01:25:31,472","01:25:32,903","What we got, Jaxx?
Anything?"
1284,"01:25:32,905","01:25:35,606","Yeah. Here's where we saw
Morris attack the shark."
1285,"01:25:35,608","01:25:38,276",But here is where it's going.
1286,"01:25:38,278","01:25:39,743",Sanya Bay. What's there?
1287,"01:25:39,745","01:25:40,878","Oh, nothing."
1288,"01:25:40,880","01:25:42,180",It only has some of the most
1289,"01:25:42,182","01:25:44,149","densely populated beaches
in the world."
1290,"01:25:44,151","01:25:45,550",Any luck with the authorities?
1291,"01:25:45,552","01:25:46,985",No.
1292,"01:25:46,987","01:25:49,387","""Prehistoric shark"" sounds
like a damn prank call."
1293,"01:25:49,389","01:25:51,423","We can't rely on them
for anything."
1294,"01:25:51,425","01:25:53,425","How long until the
shark gets to those people?"
1295,"01:25:53,427","01:25:54,625",20 minutes.
1296,"01:25:54,627","01:25:56,428","- Can we get there first?
- Doubtful."
1297,"01:25:56,430","01:25:57,761","Yeah, we're gonna have to."
1298,"01:25:57,763","01:25:58,896","Getting there first
won't mean anything"
1299,"01:25:58,898","01:26:00,465",if we don't have a plan.
1300,"01:26:00,467","01:26:02,369",Maybe we have a plan.
1301,"01:26:05,239","01:26:07,905","Here's where we do it.
Right here in the shallows."
1302,"01:26:07,907","01:26:09,673","Use the gliders
and go after it."
1303,"01:26:09,675","01:26:11,610","Okay, so, how are we
gonna get it here,"
1304,"01:26:11,612","01:26:14,379","when there's a beach full
of people to eat right here?"
1305,"01:26:14,381","01:26:16,816",You ask it out for dinner.
1306,"01:26:29,029","01:26:31,697","So...
How do you wanna do this?"
1307,"01:26:32,599","01:26:34,134",Is that you asking my opinion?
1308,"01:26:34,767","01:26:35,966",No.
1309,"01:26:35,968","01:26:37,569",I was just being polite
1310,"01:26:37,571","01:26:40,804","before telling you
what we're actually doing,"
1311,"01:26:40,806","01:26:42,574","so you feel
better about yourself."
1312,"01:26:42,576","01:26:43,943",Appreciate that.
1313,"01:26:51,151","01:26:52,152",What?
1314,"01:26:52,619","01:26:54,286",Nothing.
1315,"01:26:54,288","01:26:55,355",We're ready.
1316,"01:28:18,272","01:28:20,438",Pippin!
1317,"01:29:46,626","01:29:48,128","Oh, my God!"
1318,"01:29:59,439","01:30:01,373","We're close enough.
Stop here."
1319,"01:30:01,375","01:30:03,608","Jaxx, DJ, we gotta get
that thing in the water."
1320,"01:30:03,610","01:30:04,644","Yeah, we're on it."
1321,"01:31:01,601","01:31:05,305",Shark! Shark!
1322,"01:33:10,597","01:33:12,730","Any last
thoughts about our plan?"
1323,"01:33:12,732","01:33:14,799","Not dying
would be a good start."
1324,"01:33:14,801","01:33:17,268","Finally,
we agree on something."
1325,"01:33:17,270","01:33:19,504",Let's not make it a habit.
1326,"01:33:19,506","01:33:21,308","Suyin, look out!
Get out of there!"
1327,"01:33:32,252","01:33:33,751","- Damn it!
- What's wrong, Jonas?"
1328,"01:33:33,753","01:33:36,289","Can't make the shot.
It's too close to the ship."
1329,"01:33:37,657","01:33:38,692",Jesus!
1330,"01:33:41,062","01:33:42,660","Jonas, it's on you."
1331,"01:33:42,662","01:33:43,697",Mac!
1332,"01:33:47,068","01:33:48,566","Jonas, what's going on
down there?"
1333,"01:33:48,568","01:33:50,570","Trying to stay
out of its mouth."
1334,"01:34:12,225","01:34:13,426",Jeez!
1335,"01:34:21,267","01:34:22,535",Oops.
1336,"01:34:24,404","01:34:25,970","Suyin, are you set?
I'm coming to you."
1337,"01:34:25,972","01:34:27,672",I'm in position.
1338,"01:34:27,674","01:34:29,108",Shark's getting close.
1339,"01:34:29,110","01:34:30,810","I need a little
breathing room."
1340,"01:34:37,118","01:34:39,486","- I'm ready to fire.
- Take the shot."
1341,"01:34:41,287","01:34:42,522",Move! Move!
1342,"01:35:03,376","01:35:05,677",Anybody see it?
1343,"01:35:05,679","01:35:07,445","Can't see the shark, but
something's going on up here."
1344,"01:35:17,590","01:35:19,926","Okay,
I've got her attention."
1345,"01:35:23,196","01:35:24,397",Bring her to me.
1346,"01:35:24,999","01:35:26,266",Here we come.
1347,"01:35:29,235","01:35:31,271","Make your move, Suyin."
1348,"01:35:34,674","01:35:36,910","Chew on this,
you ugly bastard."
1349,"01:35:40,280","01:35:41,982","No, no, no! Shit!"
1350,"01:35:44,085","01:35:45,285",Jeez!
1351,"01:36:09,809","01:36:12,645","No, no, no. Go! Go! Go!"
1352,"01:36:24,324","01:36:26,491","- Where's DJ?
- I don't know."
1353,"01:36:26,493","01:36:27,859","- Where's Meiying?
- I don't know!"

the people you lose."
1392,"01:38:06,026","01:38:08,095","It's about the people
you save."

- Jonas!"
1394,"01:38:18,571","01:38:19,739",Here we go.
