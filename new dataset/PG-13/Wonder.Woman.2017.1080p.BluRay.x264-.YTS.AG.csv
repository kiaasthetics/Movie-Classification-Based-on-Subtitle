1,"00:00:48,843","00:00:51,429",I used to want to save the world.
2,"00:00:53,014","00:00:55,225",This beautiful place.
3,"00:00:57,101","00:00:59,103",But I knew so little then.
4,"00:01:01,356","00:01:03,775",It is a land of magic and wonder.
5,"00:01:04,692","00:01:07,320",Worth cherishing in every way.
6,"00:01:09,614","00:01:11,449","But the closer you get,"
7,"00:01:12,700","00:01:16,287","the more you see the great darkness
simmering within."
8,"00:01:20,708","00:01:23,253",And mankind?
9,"00:01:24,295","00:01:26,923",Mankind is another story altogether.
10,"00:01:29,259","00:01:34,180","What one does when faced with the truth
is more difficult than you think."
11,"00:01:44,440","00:01:46,192",I learned this the hard way.
12,"00:01:47,485","00:01:49,320","A long, long time ago."
13,"00:01:52,198","00:01:53,199","And now,"
14,"00:01:56,035","00:01:57,704",I will never be the same.
15,"00:02:05,378","00:02:06,379",Merci.
16,"00:02:53,301","00:02:54,594","Hello, Diana."
17,"00:02:54,761","00:02:56,512","- Hello, Diana.
- Hello."
18,"00:02:57,180","00:02:58,473",Diana!
19,"00:02:59,515","00:03:00,975",Diana!
20,"00:03:01,559","00:03:02,560",Come back!
21,"00:03:42,308","00:03:43,810","- It looks very good.
- Very good."
22,"00:03:43,976","00:03:44,977",How is she doing?
23,"00:03:45,144","00:03:46,145",She's good.
24,"00:03:46,312","00:03:47,647","- Keep working with her.
- I will."
25,"00:03:48,856","00:03:49,857",Naomi.
26,"00:04:12,338","00:04:13,381",Diana!
27,"00:04:15,007","00:04:16,342","Diana, I see you."
28,"00:04:22,682","00:04:24,725","Where are you going?
Slow down!"
29,"00:04:34,861","00:04:36,863","Hello, Mother."
30,"00:04:37,447","00:04:38,865",How are you today?
31,"00:04:40,366","00:04:42,910","Let's get you back to school
before another tutor quits."
32,"00:04:43,077","00:04:46,622","But don't you think
it's time to start my training?"
33,"00:04:47,206","00:04:49,041",Antiope thinks I'm ready.
34,"00:04:50,042","00:04:51,043",Does she?
35,"00:04:51,961","00:04:54,380",I could begin showing her some things.
36,"00:04:56,215","00:04:58,384","She should at least
be able to defend herself."
37,"00:04:58,551","00:04:59,594",From whom?
38,"00:04:59,760","00:05:01,721",In the event of an invasion.
39,"00:05:01,888","00:05:05,224","Isn't that why I have
the greatest warrior in our history"
40,"00:05:05,391","00:05:07,727","leading an entire army, General?"
41,"00:05:08,895","00:05:11,814","I pray a day will never come
where she has to fight."
42,"00:05:11,981","00:05:15,067","But you know,
a scorpion must sting,"
43,"00:05:15,234","00:05:17,820","- a wolf must hunt--
- She is a child."
44,"00:05:17,987","00:05:19,947","The only child on the island.
Please let her be so."
45,"00:05:20,114","00:05:21,115","But, Mother..."
46,"00:05:21,282","00:05:22,825",There will be no training.
47,"00:05:30,750","00:05:32,210",What if I promised to be careful?
48,"00:05:33,336","00:05:34,921",It's time to sleep.
49,"00:05:36,714","00:05:39,008",What if I didn't use a sword?
50,"00:05:39,592","00:05:41,844",Fighting does not make you a hero.
51,"00:05:42,428","00:05:44,764",Just a shield then. No sharp edges.
52,"00:05:44,931","00:05:49,101","Diana, you are the most
precious thing in the world to me."
53,"00:05:50,186","00:05:53,981","I wished for you so much so,
I sculpted you from clay myself"
54,"00:05:54,148","00:05:56,692",and begged Zeus to give you life.
55,"00:05:56,859","00:05:58,653",You've told me this story.
56,"00:05:59,237","00:06:02,657","Which is why tonight
I will tell you a new one."
57,"00:06:03,282","00:06:06,452","A story of our people,
and my days of battle."
58,"00:06:06,619","00:06:07,620",Yes!
59,"00:06:07,787","00:06:11,290","So you will finally understand
why war is nothing to hope for."
60,"00:06:17,630","00:06:20,341","Long ago, when time was new"
61,"00:06:21,008","00:06:23,970","and all of history was still a dream,"
62,"00:06:24,136","00:06:26,472","the Gods ruled the Earth,"
63,"00:06:26,639","00:06:29,308",Zeus king among them.
64,"00:06:31,852","00:06:35,022","Zeus created beings
over which the Gods would rule."
65,"00:06:35,565","00:06:38,067","Beings born in his image,"
66,"00:06:38,234","00:06:41,904","fair and good,
strong and passionate."
67,"00:06:42,822","00:06:46,742","He called his creation ""man.""
And mankind was good."
68,"00:06:47,743","00:06:50,913",But Zeus's son grew envious of mankind
69,"00:06:51,080","00:06:54,333","and sought to corrupt
his father's creation."
70,"00:06:55,334","00:06:58,838","This was Ares, the God of War."
71,"00:07:01,007","00:07:05,219","Ares poisoned men's hearts
with jealousy and suspicion."
72,"00:07:05,386","00:07:07,513",He turned them against one another
73,"00:07:07,680","00:07:10,683",and war ravaged the Earth.
74,"00:07:11,684","00:07:15,730","So, the Gods created us, the Amazons,"
75,"00:07:15,896","00:07:18,524",to influence men's hearts with love
76,"00:07:18,691","00:07:21,193",and restore peace to the Earth.
77,"00:07:24,238","00:07:27,366","And for a brief time, there was peace."
78,"00:07:33,247","00:07:34,749",But it did not last.
79,"00:07:41,422","00:07:45,092","Your mother, the Amazon Queen,
led a revolt"
80,"00:07:45,259","00:07:48,220",that freed us all from enslavement.
81,"00:07:55,311","00:07:58,481","When Zeus led the Gods to our defense,"
82,"00:07:58,648","00:08:01,901","Ares killed them one by one,"
83,"00:08:02,068","00:08:05,237",until only Zeus himself remained.
84,"00:08:06,572","00:08:10,951","Zeus used the last of his power
to stop Ares,"
85,"00:08:11,786","00:08:16,582","striking such a blow,
the God of War was forced to retreat."
86,"00:08:17,792","00:08:18,918",But Zeus knew
87,"00:08:19,085","00:08:23,255","that one day, Ares might return
to finish his mission."
88,"00:08:23,839","00:08:26,300","An endless war,"
89,"00:08:26,467","00:08:29,470","where mankind would finally
destroy themselves,"
90,"00:08:29,637","00:08:32,431",and us with them.
91,"00:08:32,598","00:08:35,017","So Zeus left us a weapon,"
92,"00:08:35,184","00:08:38,270",one powerful enough to kill a God.
93,"00:08:39,438","00:08:43,442","With his dying breath,
Zeus created this island"
94,"00:08:43,609","00:08:45,861","to hide us from the outside world,"
95,"00:08:46,028","00:08:48,364",somewhere Ares could not find us.
96,"00:08:52,827","00:08:55,121",And all has been quiet ever since.
97,"00:09:02,837","00:09:07,007","We give thanks to the Gods
for giving us this paradise."
98,"00:09:08,968","00:09:10,469",And the Godkiller?
99,"00:09:15,182","00:09:16,183",The Godkiller?
100,"00:09:16,350","00:09:18,978","The weapon that's strong enough
to kill a god."
101,"00:09:19,979","00:09:21,313",Can I see it?
102,"00:09:31,365","00:09:33,200",The Gods gave us many gifts.
103,"00:09:33,868","00:09:35,661","One day, you'll know them all."
104,"00:09:36,162","00:09:39,081",This great tower is where we keep them.
105,"00:09:51,510","00:09:52,678",The Godkiller.
106,"00:09:56,515","00:09:57,975",It's beautiful.
107,"00:09:59,560","00:10:00,936",Who would wield it?
108,"00:10:03,439","00:10:06,025",I pray it will never be called to arms.
109,"00:10:06,734","00:10:09,695",But only the fiercest among us even could.
110,"00:10:10,279","00:10:12,072","And that is not you, Diana."
111,"00:10:12,865","00:10:15,284","You see, you're safe,"
112,"00:10:15,785","00:10:18,788","and there is nothing
you should concern yourself with."
113,"00:10:32,343","00:10:33,969","You keep doubting yourself, Diana."
114,"00:10:34,136","00:10:36,347","- No, I don't.
- Yes, you do."
115,"00:10:37,056","00:10:38,224","No, I don't."
116,"00:10:43,062","00:10:44,313",You are stronger than you believe.
117,"00:10:44,480","00:10:46,565",You have greater powers than you know.
118,"00:10:46,732","00:10:48,651","- But if you don't try hard--
- Diana!"
119,"00:11:00,412","00:11:01,413",Are you hurt?
120,"00:11:01,997","00:11:03,165","No, Mother, I'm fine,"
121,"00:11:03,374","00:11:05,042","- I was just--
- Training."
122,"00:11:06,001","00:11:09,046","It seems I'm not
the revered queen I should be."
123,"00:11:09,213","00:11:11,423","Disobeyed, betrayed by my own sister..."
124,"00:11:11,590","00:11:13,801","No, Mother.
It was me, I asked her to--"
125,"00:11:13,968","00:11:15,177",Take her to the palace.
126,"00:11:17,012","00:11:18,013",Off you go.
127,"00:11:26,605","00:11:28,732","You left me no choice, Hippolyta."
128,"00:11:30,401","00:11:33,153",You neglect your duty if she cannot fight.
129,"00:11:33,320","00:11:35,406",You speak of a time that may never come.
130,"00:11:36,991","00:11:38,492",He might never return.
131,"00:11:39,577","00:11:41,370",He could have died from his wounds.
132,"00:11:41,537","00:11:44,456",Ares is alive.
133,"00:11:44,623","00:11:47,960","You feel it, as I do, in your bones."
134,"00:11:48,586","00:11:51,255","It is only a matter of time
before he returns."
135,"00:11:55,175","00:11:59,013","The stronger she gets,
the sooner he'll find her."
136,"00:11:59,179","00:12:01,932","Hippolyta, I love her as you do."
137,"00:12:03,475","00:12:06,395","But this is the only way
to truly protect her."
138,"00:12:17,448","00:12:20,868","You will train her harder than
any Amazon before her."
139,"00:12:21,619","00:12:23,454","Five times harder,"
140,"00:12:23,621","00:12:25,664",ten times harder.
141,"00:12:25,831","00:12:28,751",Until she is better than even you.
142,"00:12:29,335","00:12:31,295",But she must never know the truth
143,"00:12:31,462","00:12:33,213",about what she is
144,"00:12:33,380","00:12:35,215",or how she came to be.
145,"00:13:29,853","00:13:31,105",Harder.
146,"00:13:31,271","00:13:34,066","You're stronger than this, Diana."
147,"00:13:34,274","00:13:35,401",Again.
148,"00:13:52,543","00:13:54,003",Never let your guard down.
149,"00:13:55,212","00:13:56,964",You expect the battle to be fair.
150,"00:13:57,131","00:13:58,549",A battle will never be fair.
151,"00:14:12,479","00:14:13,480",Antiope!
152,"00:14:15,399","00:14:16,400",Lay still.
153,"00:14:16,775","00:14:17,776",You are bleeding.
154,"00:14:19,528","00:14:21,780","- I'm sorry...
- Wait, Diana, wait."
155,"00:14:28,078","00:14:29,246",What have I done?
156,"00:14:31,081","00:14:32,166",I'm sorry.
157,"00:17:03,775","00:17:05,777",Where did this fog come from?
158,"00:17:09,656","00:17:12,201",There. Go forward!
159,"00:17:29,343","00:17:31,428",There he is! The pilot! I can see him.
160,"00:17:31,595","00:17:32,804",He's there!
161,"00:18:03,669","00:18:04,670",Wow.
162,"00:18:07,756","00:18:09,091",You're a man.
163,"00:18:13,595","00:18:16,348",Yeah. I mean...
164,"00:18:18,517","00:18:20,018",Do I not look like one?
165,"00:18:24,606","00:18:25,816",Where are we?
166,"00:18:26,358","00:18:27,859",Themyscira.
167,"00:18:28,026","00:18:29,278",Therma-what?
168,"00:18:29,778","00:18:30,779",Who are you?
169,"00:18:39,162","00:18:41,790","I'm one of the good guys,
and those are the bad guys."
170,"00:18:41,957","00:18:43,000",What?
171,"00:18:43,166","00:18:44,876","The Germans. Come on,
we need to get out of here."
172,"00:18:45,043","00:18:47,170","- The Germans?
- Diana!"
173,"00:18:47,337","00:18:49,548","Step away from her, now!"
174,"00:18:51,800","00:18:53,051",Ready your bows!
175,"00:18:56,555","00:18:57,889","They have guns, right?"
176,"00:18:58,056","00:18:59,641",Fire!
177,"00:19:00,851","00:19:02,394",Fire!
178,"00:19:03,520","00:19:04,896",Come on!
179,"00:20:42,077","00:20:43,078",Stay there!
180,"00:21:21,116","00:21:22,200",Shield!
181,"00:21:43,388","00:21:45,140",No!
182,"00:21:45,307","00:21:46,308",No!
183,"00:21:52,189","00:21:53,565",No.
184,"00:21:53,732","00:21:57,694","No, no. Antiope. Antiope."
185,"00:21:57,861","00:22:00,530","Antiope, hey. Hey, hey."
186,"00:22:02,324","00:22:03,325",Hey.
187,"00:22:03,909","00:22:04,910","- Diana.
- Be still."
188,"00:22:06,745","00:22:08,205",The time has come.
189,"00:22:09,414","00:22:11,416",You... You must...
190,"00:22:11,583","00:22:14,753","What? What, Antiope?"
191,"00:22:18,882","00:22:20,258",Godkiller.
192,"00:22:20,842","00:22:22,886","- Diana, go...
- Go where?"
193,"00:22:23,678","00:22:25,013","- Go where?
- Go..."
194,"00:22:25,180","00:22:28,058","No, please, no. No. No!"
195,"00:22:28,225","00:22:30,185","No, no, no."
196,"00:22:30,977","00:22:32,812","- No!
- Antiope!"
197,"00:22:34,397","00:22:35,565",No!
198,"00:22:42,781","00:22:44,115","- You.
- No."
199,"00:22:45,534","00:22:47,035","No, Mother, no."
200,"00:22:47,202","00:22:48,954",He fought at my side against the invaders.
201,"00:22:49,120","00:22:50,956",What man fights against his own people?
202,"00:22:51,122","00:22:53,959","- These aren't my people.
- Then why do you wear their colors?"
203,"00:22:56,086","00:22:57,087",I can't tell you that.
204,"00:22:57,254","00:22:58,296",You need to tell us now!
205,"00:22:58,463","00:22:59,506",What is your name?
206,"00:23:00,882","00:23:02,259",I can't tell you that either.
207,"00:23:03,093","00:23:05,887","We should kill him now,
and be done with it."
208,"00:23:06,054","00:23:07,055","If he dies,"
209,"00:23:07,722","00:23:12,394","we know nothing about who they are,
and why they came."
210,"00:23:19,985","00:23:21,736","My, uh,"
211,"00:23:23,154","00:23:27,659","name is Captain Steve Trevor,
pilot, American Expeditionary Forces."
212,"00:23:27,826","00:23:30,954",Serial number 8141921.
213,"00:23:31,162","00:23:33,373",That's all I'm at liberty to...
214,"00:23:37,669","00:23:39,504",Assigned to British Intelligence.
215,"00:23:41,298","00:23:42,966",What the hell is this thing?
216,"00:23:43,133","00:23:46,177","The Lasso of Hestia compels you
to reveal the truth."
217,"00:23:46,720","00:23:48,179",But it's really hot.
218,"00:23:48,346","00:23:51,349","It is pointless, and painful, to resist."
219,"00:23:52,100","00:23:53,310",What is your mission?
220,"00:23:53,476","00:23:57,272","Whoever you are,
you are in more danger than you think."
221,"00:23:57,439","00:23:58,481",What is your mission?
222,"00:24:01,860","00:24:02,861",I am a...
223,"00:24:07,532","00:24:08,533",I am a...
224,"00:24:11,870","00:24:13,204",I am a spy.
225,"00:24:16,541","00:24:19,002",I'm a spy. I'm a spy.
226,"00:24:21,755","00:24:23,048",British Intelligence got word
227,"00:24:23,214","00:24:25,675","that the leader of the German Army,
General Ludendorff,"
228,"00:24:25,842","00:24:29,721","would be visiting a secret military
installation in the Ottoman Empire."
229,"00:24:29,888","00:24:33,058","I posed as one of their pilots,
and flew in with them."
230,"00:24:33,224","00:24:36,728","According to our intel,
the Germans had no troops left,"
231,"00:24:36,895","00:24:39,564","no money, no munitions of any kind."
232,"00:24:39,731","00:24:41,066",But our intel was wrong.
233,"00:24:41,232","00:24:43,943","The Germans had the Turks
building bombs for them."
234,"00:24:44,110","00:24:47,238","And not just bombs, new weapons."
235,"00:24:47,405","00:24:48,990",Secret weapons.
236,"00:24:50,450","00:24:55,205","Invented by Ludendorff's
chief psychopath, Dr. Isabel Maru."
237,"00:24:56,581","00:24:59,084","The boys in the trenches
called her ""Dr. Poison."""
238,"00:25:00,585","00:25:01,711",And for good reason.
239,"00:25:30,573","00:25:34,077","From what I could tell, if Dr. Maru
was able to complete her work,"
240,"00:25:34,244","00:25:37,288","millions more would die.
The war would never end."
241,"00:25:37,956","00:25:40,041","I was there to observe and report,
nothing more,"
242,"00:25:41,751","00:25:43,586",but I had to do something.
243,"00:25:48,675","00:25:49,968",I'm so close.
244,"00:25:50,135","00:25:53,179","I know I can make the gas
penetrate the mask."
245,"00:25:53,346","00:25:55,557",I just... I need more time.
246,"00:25:55,724","00:25:57,475","Unfortunately, Doctor,
we do not have more time."
247,"00:25:57,642","00:25:59,561","This work, this..."
248,"00:26:04,899","00:26:06,151",Get that man!
249,"00:26:06,317","00:26:07,527",There!
250,"00:27:01,539","00:27:04,959","But if I can get these notes back
to British Intelligence in time,"
251,"00:27:05,710","00:27:08,296",it could stop millions more from dying.
252,"00:27:09,297","00:27:11,216",It could stop the war.
253,"00:27:11,382","00:27:13,510",War? What war?
254,"00:27:15,720","00:27:17,138",The war.
255,"00:27:20,058","00:27:22,560",The war to end all wars.
256,"00:27:23,895","00:27:25,605","Four years,"
257,"00:27:25,772","00:27:28,024","27 countries,"
258,"00:27:28,191","00:27:30,151","25 million dead,"
259,"00:27:30,735","00:27:32,737",soldiers and civilians.
260,"00:27:32,904","00:27:34,823","Innocent people,"
261,"00:27:35,740","00:27:37,992",women and children slaughtered.
262,"00:27:39,327","00:27:42,831","Their homes and their villages
looted and burned."
263,"00:27:46,918","00:27:49,170",Weapons far deadlier than you can
264,"00:27:52,090","00:27:53,591",ever imagine.
265,"00:27:57,929","00:27:59,681",It's like nothing I've ever seen.
266,"00:28:01,099","00:28:02,851",It's like the world's going to end.
267,"00:28:05,103","00:28:06,354",Should we let him go?
268,"00:28:06,521","00:28:09,107","And risk him bringing
more men to our shores?"
269,"00:28:09,274","00:28:11,359","We cannot hold him forever, my queen."
270,"00:28:11,526","00:28:13,611","Mother. Excuse me,"
271,"00:28:13,778","00:28:17,615","but after everything the man said,
this must be Ares."
272,"00:28:17,782","00:28:19,033","What are you talking about, child?"
273,"00:28:19,200","00:28:22,203","Forgive me, Senator,
but the man called it ""a war without end."""
274,"00:28:23,121","00:28:25,290",Millions of people already dead.
275,"00:28:25,790","00:28:27,709",Like nothing he's ever seen.
276,"00:28:28,293","00:28:30,295",Only Ares could do such a thing.
277,"00:28:32,297","00:28:35,383","We cannot simply let him go.
We must go with him."
278,"00:28:36,301","00:28:38,219","I will not deploy our army
and leave Themyscira defenseless"
279,"00:28:38,386","00:28:39,429",to go and fight their war.
280,"00:28:39,596","00:28:41,472",It is not their war.
281,"00:28:41,639","00:28:44,809","Zeus created man to be
just and wise, strong and passionate--"
282,"00:28:44,976","00:28:47,395","That was a story, Diana!"
283,"00:28:47,562","00:28:48,897",There is much you do not understand.
284,"00:28:49,063","00:28:50,106",Men are easily corrupted.
285,"00:28:50,273","00:28:53,067","Yes, but Ares is behind that corruption!"
286,"00:28:53,234","00:28:56,112",It is Ares who has these Germans fighting.
287,"00:28:56,279","00:29:00,325","And stopping the God of War
is our foreordinance."
288,"00:29:00,491","00:29:02,911","As Amazons, this is our duty."
289,"00:29:03,077","00:29:05,914","But you are not an Amazon
like the rest of us."
290,"00:29:06,956","00:29:08,416",So you will do nothing.
291,"00:29:09,083","00:29:10,084","As your queen, I forbid it."
292,"00:29:23,348","00:29:24,515",Strange.
293,"00:29:26,351","00:29:28,311",Is it true you saved his life?
294,"00:29:28,853","00:29:29,854",Who told you that?
295,"00:29:30,021","00:29:31,022",He did.
296,"00:29:54,379","00:29:55,380",Whoa! I...
297,"00:29:57,966","00:29:59,550",I didn't see you come in.
298,"00:30:04,889","00:30:07,725",Would you say you're a
299,"00:30:08,559","00:30:11,145",typical example of your sex?
300,"00:30:11,771","00:30:13,439",I am
301,"00:30:16,693","00:30:18,403",above average.
302,"00:30:22,031","00:30:23,157",What's that?
303,"00:30:25,076","00:30:26,494",It's a...
304,"00:30:28,538","00:30:29,539",Oh! Um...
305,"00:30:31,749","00:30:33,668",It's a watch.
306,"00:30:34,085","00:30:35,086",A watch?
307,"00:30:35,253","00:30:36,254","Yeah, it's a watch."
308,"00:30:36,421","00:30:37,839",It tells time.
309,"00:30:38,840","00:30:40,842",My father gave it to me.
310,"00:30:42,552","00:30:44,053",It's been through hell and back with him.
311,"00:30:45,513","00:30:48,474","Now it's with me,
and good thing it's still ticking."
312,"00:30:49,517","00:30:50,518",What for?
313,"00:30:52,437","00:30:54,022",Because it tells time.
314,"00:30:55,440","00:30:57,942","When to eat, sleep, wake up, work."
315,"00:30:59,610","00:31:02,488","You let this little thing
tell you what to do?"
316,"00:31:02,655","00:31:04,115",Yeah.
317,"00:31:10,621","00:31:12,123",Can I ask you some questions?
318,"00:31:13,583","00:31:14,959","- Where are we?
- Themyscira."
319,"00:31:15,126","00:31:18,629","No, I got that before.
But I mean, where are we?"
320,"00:31:19,922","00:31:21,215","What is this place?
Who are you people?"
321,"00:31:21,382","00:31:23,468",Why does the water do that?
322,"00:31:23,634","00:31:26,137","How come you don't know what a watch is?
How come you speak English so well?"
323,"00:31:26,304","00:31:28,431",We speak hundreds of languages.
324,"00:31:29,307","00:31:32,685","We are the bridge to
a greater understanding between all men."
325,"00:31:34,896","00:31:35,980",Right.
326,"00:31:39,442","00:31:42,653","You know, I didn't get a chance
to say this, uh, earlier,"
327,"00:31:44,072","00:31:48,326","but thank you for dragging me
out of the water."
328,"00:31:49,744","00:31:51,162",Thank you
329,"00:31:51,746","00:31:53,831",for what you did on the beach.
330,"00:32:01,964","00:32:02,965","So,"
331,"00:32:04,342","00:32:05,718",you're here to let me go?
332,"00:32:07,136","00:32:10,681","I tried, but it's not up to me."
333,"00:32:11,224","00:32:13,017",I even asked them to send me with you.
334,"00:32:15,520","00:32:16,938",Or anyone.
335,"00:32:17,105","00:32:18,147",An Amazon.
336,"00:32:18,314","00:32:19,982",The Amazons.
337,"00:32:20,149","00:32:21,609",The Amazons?
338,"00:32:21,776","00:32:24,529",It is our sacred duty to defend the world.
339,"00:32:25,196","00:32:27,031",And I wish to go.
340,"00:32:29,700","00:32:31,911",But my mother will not allow it.
341,"00:32:34,330","00:32:35,331","Well,"
342,"00:32:36,874","00:32:38,876",I can't say I blame her.
343,"00:32:39,043","00:32:40,044","The way this war is going,"
344,"00:32:40,211","00:32:43,131","I wouldn't want to
let anyone I care about near it."
345,"00:32:43,297","00:32:45,216",Then why do you want to go back?
346,"00:32:45,758","00:32:47,802","I don't think ""want"" is the word."
347,"00:32:49,679","00:32:52,181",I guess I gotta try.
348,"00:32:54,058","00:32:56,144","My father told me once,"
349,"00:32:56,310","00:32:58,646","he said, ""If you see something wrong
happening in the world,"
350,"00:32:58,813","00:33:01,524","you can either do nothing,
or you can do something."""
351,"00:33:03,568","00:33:05,403","And I already tried ""nothing."""
352,"00:35:44,312","00:35:45,354",Nice outfit.
353,"00:35:46,647","00:35:47,732","Oh, thank you."
354,"00:35:48,482","00:35:51,485","Now, I will show you the way off the island"
355,"00:35:52,069","00:35:53,612",and you will take me to Ares.
356,"00:35:54,447","00:35:55,448",Deal.
357,"00:36:04,623","00:36:06,000",I'm leaving in that?
358,"00:36:06,167","00:36:07,418",We are.
359,"00:36:08,836","00:36:10,838","Yeah, we're leaving in that?"
360,"00:36:11,005","00:36:12,465",Do you not know how to sail?
361,"00:36:12,631","00:36:13,758",Of course I know how to sail.
362,"00:36:13,924","00:36:15,593","Why wouldn't I know how to sail?
It's just..."
363,"00:36:16,635","00:36:17,970",It's been a while.
364,"00:36:47,458","00:36:48,959","I'm going, Mother."
365,"00:36:49,585","00:36:52,755","I cannot stand by
while innocent lives are lost."
366,"00:36:53,631","00:36:58,052","If no one else will defend the world
from Ares, then I must."
367,"00:36:59,845","00:37:01,180",I have to go.
368,"00:37:01,347","00:37:02,723",I know.
369,"00:37:03,891","00:37:06,227",Or at least I know I cannot stop you.
370,"00:37:11,941","00:37:13,692",There is so much...
371,"00:37:14,735","00:37:15,945",So much you do not understand.
372,"00:37:16,112","00:37:17,571",I understand enough.
373,"00:37:17,738","00:37:21,283","That I'm willing to fight for those
who cannot fight for themselves."
374,"00:37:23,994","00:37:25,496",Like you once did.
375,"00:37:26,163","00:37:28,082","You know that if you choose to leave,"
376,"00:37:29,792","00:37:31,168",you may never return.
377,"00:37:33,087","00:37:35,005",Who will I be if I stay?
378,"00:37:43,889","00:37:46,851","This belonged to
the greatest warrior in our history,"
379,"00:37:47,435","00:37:50,020",our beloved Antiope.
380,"00:37:50,187","00:37:52,314",Make sure you are worthy of it.
381,"00:37:53,899","00:37:55,151",I will.
382,"00:37:58,237","00:38:00,739","Be careful in the world of men, Diana."
383,"00:38:02,283","00:38:04,660",They do not deserve you.
384,"00:38:09,248","00:38:12,209",You have been my greatest love.
385,"00:38:16,297","00:38:17,506","Today,"
386,"00:38:19,550","00:38:21,552",you are my greatest sorrow.
387,"00:39:00,424","00:39:01,800",Should you have told her?
388,"00:39:02,676","00:39:07,139","The more she knows,
the sooner he'll find her."
389,"00:39:18,776","00:39:20,653",How long until we reach the war?
390,"00:39:21,862","00:39:23,989",The war? Which part?
391,"00:39:24,156","00:39:25,407",The Western Front in France
392,"00:39:25,574","00:39:27,952","is 400 miles long
from the Alps to the North Sea."
393,"00:39:29,662","00:39:31,539","Where the fighting
is the most intense, then."
394,"00:39:31,705","00:39:34,583","If you take me there,
I'm sure I'll find Ares."
395,"00:39:38,504","00:39:40,881","Ares? As in, the God of War?"
396,"00:39:41,048","00:39:45,135","The God of War is our responsibility.
Only an Amazon can defeat him."
397,"00:39:46,011","00:39:47,638",With this.
398,"00:39:49,098","00:39:50,266","And once I do,"
399,"00:39:50,808","00:39:52,434",the war will end.
400,"00:39:59,567","00:40:01,652","Look, I appreciate your spirit,"
401,"00:40:02,319","00:40:04,363",but this war is...
402,"00:40:04,530","00:40:06,740",It's a great big mess.
403,"00:40:07,616","00:40:10,411","And there's not a whole lot
you and I can do about that."
404,"00:40:10,578","00:40:13,163","I mean, we can get back to London,
and try to get to the men who can."
405,"00:40:13,330","00:40:15,416",I'm the man who can!
406,"00:40:15,583","00:40:17,376","And once I find and destroy Ares,"
407,"00:40:17,543","00:40:20,170","the German armies
will be freed from his influence"
408,"00:40:20,337","00:40:23,340","and they will be good men again,
and the world will be better."
409,"00:40:27,845","00:40:28,846",Great.
410,"00:40:29,763","00:40:30,848",You'll see.
411,"00:40:34,310","00:40:35,352",What are you doing?
412,"00:40:35,769","00:40:37,855","Oh, I thought maybe you'd want to"
413,"00:40:39,273","00:40:40,399",get some sleep.
414,"00:40:43,360","00:40:46,530","And what about you?
Are you not sleeping?"
415,"00:40:46,697","00:40:48,365",Does the average man not sleep?
416,"00:40:52,494","00:40:55,623","Yes, we sleep.
We just don't sleep with, uh..."
417,"00:40:55,789","00:40:56,790",You don't sleep with women?
418,"00:40:56,957","00:40:59,877","No. I mean, I do sleep with...
I sleep with..."
419,"00:41:01,211","00:41:02,630","Yes, I do."
420,"00:41:02,796","00:41:05,257","But, out of the, uh,"
421,"00:41:05,466","00:41:07,843",confines of marriage
422,"00:41:08,010","00:41:09,428",it's just...
423,"00:41:11,889","00:41:13,891","It's not polite to assume, you know?"
424,"00:41:17,645","00:41:19,104","""Marriage""?"
425,"00:41:19,271","00:41:21,190",Marriage. Do you not have that on...
426,"00:41:22,441","00:41:23,817",You go before a judge
427,"00:41:23,984","00:41:28,155","and you swear to love,
honor and cherish each other"
428,"00:41:28,322","00:41:29,448",until death do you part.
429,"00:41:30,324","00:41:32,576","And do they?
Love each other till death?"
430,"00:41:32,743","00:41:34,495","Not very often, no."
431,"00:41:34,662","00:41:36,080",Then why do they do it?
432,"00:41:36,872","00:41:39,333",I have no idea.
433,"00:41:40,167","00:41:41,835","So, you cannot sleep with me
unless I marry you."
434,"00:41:42,002","00:41:44,213","I will sleep with you, if you want.
I'll sleep right there."
435,"00:41:44,380","00:41:45,464",There's plenty of room.
436,"00:41:45,631","00:41:48,175","- Then, fine, if you don't mind...
- No, it's up to you."
437,"00:41:48,342","00:41:50,761","I know it's up to me, I'm making
the choice. I will come sleep with you."
438,"00:41:50,928","00:41:51,929",Okay.
439,"00:41:54,807","00:41:55,974","Yeah, just..."
440,"00:41:57,267","00:41:58,477",Okay.
441,"00:42:13,492","00:42:18,122","You know, where I come from,
I'm not considered average."
442,"00:42:18,872","00:42:21,083","You know, being a spy,"
443,"00:42:21,250","00:42:24,545",you have to show a certain amount of
444,"00:42:26,588","00:42:27,798",vigor.
445,"00:42:31,051","00:42:34,304","Have you never met a man before?
What about your father?"
446,"00:42:34,471","00:42:36,223",I had no father.
447,"00:42:36,890","00:42:38,517",My mother sculpted me from clay
448,"00:42:38,684","00:42:40,811",and I was brought to life by Zeus.
449,"00:42:44,189","00:42:45,649","Well, that's neat."
450,"00:42:49,236","00:42:50,654",Sorry.
451,"00:42:53,157","00:42:54,658","Where I come from,"
452,"00:42:55,909","00:42:58,203",babies are made differently.
453,"00:42:59,204","00:43:01,039",You refer to reproductive biology.
454,"00:43:01,206","00:43:02,791","- Yes, yes.
- Yeah, I know."
455,"00:43:03,584","00:43:05,127",I know all about that.
456,"00:43:05,294","00:43:08,130","I mean, I refer to that,
and other things."
457,"00:43:09,047","00:43:10,340",The pleasures of the flesh.
458,"00:43:13,218","00:43:15,137",Do you know about that?
459,"00:43:16,305","00:43:20,100","I've read all 12 volumes of Clio's
Treatises on Bodily Pleasure."
460,"00:43:21,935","00:43:23,979","- All 12, huh?
- Mmm-hmm."
461,"00:43:28,609","00:43:30,068",Did you bring any of those with you?
462,"00:43:30,694","00:43:31,862",You would not enjoy them.
463,"00:43:32,029","00:43:33,363",I don't know. Maybe.
464,"00:43:33,530","00:43:34,656","No, you wouldn't."
465,"00:43:34,823","00:43:36,200",Why not?
466,"00:43:36,366","00:43:39,495","They came to the conclusion that men
are essential for procreation,"
467,"00:43:39,661","00:43:41,538","but when it comes to pleasure,"
468,"00:43:41,872","00:43:43,791",unnecessary.
469,"00:43:43,957","00:43:45,459","No, no."
470,"00:43:50,088","00:43:51,089",Good night.
471,"00:43:51,298","00:43:52,549",Night.
472,"00:44:05,062","00:44:06,688",How long until we are operational?
473,"00:44:06,855","00:44:08,065","Two days, sir."
474,"00:44:08,232","00:44:09,900","You have until tonight, Captain."
475,"00:44:10,067","00:44:14,196","Sir, the men have had no food,
no sleep."
476,"00:44:14,363","00:44:16,532","Do you think I have had
any food or rest, Captain?"
477,"00:44:16,990","00:44:18,617",Do you hear me making excuses?
478,"00:44:18,784","00:44:19,785",No.
479,"00:44:19,952","00:44:21,411","Your men are weak, complacent."
480,"00:44:21,578","00:44:24,540","You've let them forget that
an attack can happen at any time,"
481,"00:44:24,706","00:44:26,124",from any quarter!
482,"00:44:26,291","00:44:27,459","So, let's you and I remind them,"
483,"00:44:27,626","00:44:28,627",shall we?
484,"00:44:43,433","00:44:45,227","- Doctor.
- General."
485,"00:44:45,394","00:44:46,395",Progress?
486,"00:44:46,562","00:44:47,855",Not enough.
487,"00:44:48,730","00:44:50,691","It is over, General."
488,"00:44:50,858","00:44:52,734",Germany is giving up.
489,"00:44:52,901","00:44:56,822","Von Hindenburg has recommended
the Kaiser sign the armistice."
490,"00:44:56,989","00:44:59,032",We have run out of time.
491,"00:45:00,659","00:45:03,453","As soon as the Kaiser
sees the newest weapon,"
492,"00:45:03,620","00:45:05,330",he will not sign the armistice.
493,"00:45:05,497","00:45:06,582","But, without my book--"
494,"00:45:06,748","00:45:08,000",We will get your book!
495,"00:45:08,166","00:45:10,627",It is you that I believe in. Not it.
496,"00:45:12,004","00:45:15,048","I know that you can,
and will, succeed. Hmm."
497,"00:45:16,884","00:45:20,220","It is what you were put on this earth
to do."
498,"00:45:23,849","00:45:27,269",Something did come to me last night.
499,"00:45:27,436","00:45:29,438",A different type of gas.
500,"00:45:30,355","00:45:31,440",For you.
501,"00:45:31,982","00:45:33,984",To restore your strength.
502,"00:46:04,097","00:46:06,433",I've got it. I've got it!
503,"00:46:07,017","00:46:10,103","And if it's what I think,"
504,"00:46:11,271","00:46:13,106",it's going to be
505,"00:46:14,691","00:46:16,193",terrible.
506,"00:46:37,506","00:46:38,674",Morning!
507,"00:46:39,174","00:46:41,718","We got lucky, we caught a ride.
We made some good time."
508,"00:46:41,885","00:46:44,221",Welcome to jolly old London!
509,"00:46:44,596","00:46:46,014",It's hideous.
510,"00:46:46,556","00:46:48,016","Yeah, it's not for everybody."
511,"00:47:10,414","00:47:11,873","- Morning, darling.
- What a beauty."
512,"00:47:12,040","00:47:13,041","Hello, beautiful!"
513,"00:47:13,208","00:47:15,711","Gentlemen, eyes to yourself.
Thank you so much."
514,"00:47:17,671","00:47:19,631",Come on! Come on.
515,"00:47:21,174","00:47:22,759",Why are they holding hands?
516,"00:47:23,051","00:47:25,804","Uh, probably because they're together."
517,"00:47:28,557","00:47:31,101","No, no, no. We're not together.
I mean, in that way."
518,"00:47:31,268","00:47:32,269",This way.
519,"00:47:32,436","00:47:33,645",To the war!
520,"00:47:33,812","00:47:36,356","Well, technically, the war is that way.
But we gotta go this way first."
521,"00:47:36,523","00:47:38,025",And where are we going?
522,"00:47:38,191","00:47:39,943",We gotta get this notebook to my superiors.
523,"00:47:40,110","00:47:41,194","Hey, hey, hey!"
524,"00:47:41,361","00:47:44,489","No, no, no.
I let you go, you take me to Ares."
525,"00:47:44,656","00:47:46,408","We made a deal, Steve Trevor."
526,"00:47:46,575","00:47:47,951",And a deal is a promise.
527,"00:47:48,118","00:47:49,953",And a promise is unbreakable.
528,"00:47:50,704","00:47:52,789","Oh, boy. Damn it. All right."
529,"00:47:54,041","00:47:55,876","You come with me first to deliver this,"
530,"00:47:56,043","00:47:58,336","and then we'll get you a ticket,
uh..."
531,"00:47:58,587","00:47:59,671",to the war.
532,"00:47:59,963","00:48:00,964",Deal?
533,"00:48:02,466","00:48:03,592","- Let's go.
- Diana..."
534,"00:48:03,759","00:48:04,760",What are you doing?
535,"00:48:04,926","00:48:06,887","You can't do that because
you're not wearing any clothes."
536,"00:48:07,054","00:48:10,307","Let's go...
Let's go buy you some clothes."
537,"00:48:10,474","00:48:12,267",What do these women wear into battle?
538,"00:48:12,434","00:48:13,810","They don't, uh..."
539,"00:48:14,019","00:48:15,604",A baby!
540,"00:48:16,980","00:48:18,231","- No, no, no. No babies.
- Oh... Oh..."
541,"00:48:18,398","00:48:20,067","No, please. No babies."
542,"00:48:20,233","00:48:22,027",That one's not made out of clay.
543,"00:48:22,360","00:48:23,445",Come on.
544,"00:48:23,612","00:48:25,614",Diana! Please.
545,"00:48:40,837","00:48:43,340",Thank God! You're not dead!
546,"00:48:44,841","00:48:46,468",Hoorah and huzzah!
547,"00:48:46,635","00:48:48,929","I did think you were dead
until I got your call, you know?"
548,"00:48:49,513","00:48:51,723","He's been gone for weeks.
Not a single word."
549,"00:48:51,890","00:48:52,891",Very unlike him.
550,"00:48:53,058","00:48:55,477","I'm introducing myself.
It's Etta Candy."
551,"00:48:55,644","00:48:57,646",I'm Steve Trevor's secretary.
552,"00:48:57,813","00:48:59,147",What is a secretary?
553,"00:48:59,314","00:49:00,690","Ooh! Well, I do everything."
554,"00:49:00,857","00:49:02,943","I go where he tells me to go,
and I do what he tells me to do."
555,"00:49:03,568","00:49:05,987","Well, where I'm from,
that's called slavery."
556,"00:49:06,154","00:49:07,280",I really like her.
557,"00:49:07,447","00:49:08,657","Fantastic. Ladies, after you."
558,"00:49:08,824","00:49:09,991","Oh, I do, I like her."
559,"00:49:10,158","00:49:12,077","And it does rather feel like that,"
560,"00:49:12,244","00:49:13,787",except the pay is very good.
561,"00:49:13,954","00:49:16,289","We've got our work cut out for us,
haven't we?"
562,"00:49:18,458","00:49:22,379","Is this what passes for armor
in your country?"
563,"00:49:24,047","00:49:25,215","""Armor."" It's fashion."
564,"00:49:25,382","00:49:26,842",Keeps our tummies in.
565,"00:49:27,384","00:49:28,635",Why must you keep them in?
566,"00:49:28,802","00:49:31,054","Only a woman with no tummy
would ask that question."
567,"00:49:32,764","00:49:36,309","Conservative,
but not entirely un-fun."
568,"00:49:37,561","00:49:38,937","Try it on, at least."
569,"00:49:39,104","00:49:40,147",Very well.
570,"00:49:41,439","00:49:43,024","- Ooh! Ah, ah, ah...
- No! No, no, no."
571,"00:49:43,400","00:49:44,526",Ooh!
572,"00:49:49,865","00:49:51,408",Come on! Oh!
573,"00:50:00,125","00:50:02,919",How can a woman possibly fight in this?
574,"00:50:03,086","00:50:04,171",Fight?
575,"00:50:04,337","00:50:05,922",We use our principles.
576,"00:50:06,089","00:50:07,799","I mean, that's how
we're going to get the vote."
577,"00:50:07,966","00:50:11,720","Although, I am not opposed to
engaging in a bit of fisticuffs,"
578,"00:50:11,887","00:50:13,638",should the occasion arise.
579,"00:50:14,973","00:50:16,266",Lovely.
580,"00:50:16,558","00:50:17,559",Oop!
581,"00:50:17,767","00:50:20,187",It's itchy. It's choking me.
582,"00:50:21,563","00:50:23,648",Can't say I blame it.
583,"00:50:23,815","00:50:25,066",Etta.
584,"00:50:25,233","00:50:26,234",Where is she?
585,"00:50:26,443","00:50:28,778","Oh, she's trying on outfit number 226."
586,"00:50:38,622","00:50:41,750","Miss Candy, the whole point
was to make her look less"
587,"00:50:41,917","00:50:43,084",distracting.
588,"00:50:45,420","00:50:46,421",May I?
589,"00:50:51,134","00:50:52,469",Really? Specs?
590,"00:50:52,636","00:50:54,763","And suddenly she's not the most
beautiful woman you've ever seen?"
591,"00:51:01,436","00:51:02,646",Better.
592,"00:51:13,782","00:51:15,116","Yeah, that's not going to work."
593,"00:51:15,283","00:51:16,993","Please put the sword down, Diana."
594,"00:51:17,160","00:51:18,161",Diana!
595,"00:51:19,412","00:51:20,538",Let me try it by myself.
596,"00:51:20,705","00:51:21,790","After you, sir."
597,"00:51:31,341","00:51:32,342",Etta...
598,"00:51:32,759","00:51:35,095",Why don't I meet you back at the office
599,"00:51:35,262","00:51:37,347","and, meanwhile,
I'll take this for safekeeping."
600,"00:51:37,514","00:51:38,515","Oh, no, I don't think so."
601,"00:51:38,682","00:51:40,433","You gotta put the sword down, Diana.
Please."
602,"00:51:40,600","00:51:41,851","- It doesn't go with the outfit.
- At all."
603,"00:51:42,018","00:51:44,646","Put the sword down, first of all."
604,"00:51:47,065","00:51:50,652","Promise me you will protect it
with your life."
605,"00:51:51,194","00:51:52,946",Yes... No.
606,"00:51:53,321","00:51:55,240",You can trust her. Just hand that over.
607,"00:51:55,407","00:51:57,242","- Shield.
- And the shield to her."
608,"00:51:57,409","00:51:58,410",There we go. Whoa!
609,"00:51:58,576","00:51:59,577","You got it? Thanks, Etta."
610,"00:51:59,744","00:52:01,663",This is easy.
611,"00:52:03,039","00:52:04,416",Oh. There we go.
612,"00:52:32,277","00:52:33,278",What is it?
613,"00:52:35,113","00:52:37,532",Hopefully nothing. Come on.
614,"00:52:47,208","00:52:49,252","- Steve, why are we hiding?
- Shh! Come on, come on."
615,"00:52:58,803","00:53:00,472",Captain Trevor.
616,"00:53:01,306","00:53:04,434","I believe you have something that is
the property of General Ludendorff."
617,"00:53:06,061","00:53:08,730","Ah, it's the, uh, bad-guy convention."
618,"00:53:08,938","00:53:11,441",Give us Dr. Maru's notebook.
619,"00:53:12,067","00:53:13,568",Where did I put that thing?
620,"00:53:14,611","00:53:17,030",Stand back!
621,"00:53:27,665","00:53:28,750",Or maybe not.
622,"00:53:44,808","00:53:45,975",Tough luck.
623,"00:53:52,148","00:53:54,317",Is there anything else you want to show me?
624,"00:53:55,652","00:53:56,820",Where do you think you're going?
625,"00:53:59,406","00:54:00,824",Oh!
626,"00:54:03,576","00:54:06,287","I'm sorry. But you are
clearly under his control."
627,"00:54:06,454","00:54:09,165","- Diana...
- Let me help you get free."
628,"00:54:09,332","00:54:10,875",Where will I find Ares?
629,"00:54:18,216","00:54:20,510","- He's... He's dead.
- Hmm."
630,"00:54:21,219","00:54:22,512",Cyanide.
631,"00:54:31,354","00:54:33,064",Stay here. I'll be right back.
632,"00:54:33,231","00:54:36,025","Gentlemen! Gentlemen, please!"
633,"00:54:36,860","00:54:40,655","The sad truth is, the majority of them
don't even know what they're fighting for!"
634,"00:54:40,822","00:54:41,823",Let him speak!
635,"00:54:41,990","00:54:44,159","Yes, thank you. Gentlemen..."
636,"00:54:44,701","00:54:48,746",Germany is an immensely proud nation.
637,"00:54:50,039","00:54:51,875",They will never surrender.
638,"00:54:52,292","00:54:54,919","Now, look.
The only way to end this war..."
639,"00:54:55,086","00:54:58,423","Colonel,
I have to talk to you outside."
640,"00:54:58,590","00:55:00,842",...and restore world peace
641,"00:55:01,009","00:55:02,552",is to negotiate
642,"00:55:04,262","00:55:05,972",an armistice.
643,"00:55:06,556","00:55:08,975","- There's a woman in here.
- Um..."
644,"00:55:09,142","00:55:10,602","What's she doing in here?
Get her out."
645,"00:55:12,479","00:55:13,730",Get her out.
646,"00:55:14,397","00:55:15,440",Sorry.
647,"00:55:15,607","00:55:17,901","Blind sister.
She got lost on the way to the bathroom."
648,"00:55:18,067","00:55:20,069","I think it's this way.
Sorry, guys."
649,"00:55:20,778","00:55:22,947","Um...
Our only aim at this time"
650,"00:55:23,114","00:55:25,742","must be to achieve peace,"
651,"00:55:25,909","00:55:27,785",at any cost!
652,"00:55:31,289","00:55:33,583","Why do they not let him speak?
He's talking peace."
653,"00:55:33,750","00:55:35,251",Not right now. Sorry.
654,"00:55:40,089","00:55:42,800","Trevor, what the hell were you thinking,
bringing a woman into the Council Chamber?"
655,"00:55:42,967","00:55:44,928","The intel that I brought back
is time-sensitive."
656,"00:55:45,094","00:55:46,513",This is one of Dr. Maru's notebooks.
657,"00:55:46,679","00:55:47,680",Notebook or not--
658,"00:55:47,847","00:55:48,848",We need to get it to cryptography
659,"00:55:49,015","00:55:50,600","and I need an immediate audience
with the generals."
660,"00:55:50,767","00:55:52,936","You do not just barge in here
and demand an audience with the Cabinet."
661,"00:55:53,102","00:55:54,646","Sir, with all due respect,
what I saw in my last mission"
662,"00:55:54,812","00:55:55,855",could change the course of the war.
663,"00:55:56,022","00:55:57,440",Captain Trevor!
664,"00:55:59,025","00:56:00,652","I heard we'd lost you
on one of your missions,"
665,"00:56:00,818","00:56:02,320","yet here you are,
back from the dead,"
666,"00:56:02,487","00:56:04,405",and I see you've brought a friend with you.
667,"00:56:04,572","00:56:05,949","Our deepest apologies
for the interruption, sir."
668,"00:56:06,115","00:56:07,742","No, no, no. Nonsense."
669,"00:56:07,909","00:56:09,619","Thanks to this young woman,"
670,"00:56:09,786","00:56:13,289","the room was finally quiet enough for me
to get at least a few words in."
671,"00:56:13,456","00:56:15,333","Sir Patrick Morgan, at your service."
672,"00:56:16,000","00:56:17,961","Diana, Princess of Themys--"
673,"00:56:18,127","00:56:19,963","""Prince."" Diana Prince."
674,"00:56:20,797","00:56:21,839","She is, uh..."
675,"00:56:22,006","00:56:23,007",And I...
676,"00:56:23,174","00:56:24,217",Are...
677,"00:56:24,384","00:56:25,385",Working together.
678,"00:56:25,552","00:56:27,512","She actually helped me
bring this, uh, notebook back here."
679,"00:56:27,679","00:56:29,973",That's from Dr. Maru's lab.
680,"00:56:30,139","00:56:32,809","I think the information contained inside
will change the course of the war, sir."
681,"00:56:32,976","00:56:34,811",My God.
682,"00:56:35,770","00:56:37,814","- Dr. Poison, herself.
- Yes."
683,"00:57:07,969","00:57:09,012",Yes.
684,"00:57:09,679","00:57:11,097",Intriguing.
685,"00:57:11,264","00:57:12,557",Any further intelligence?
686,"00:57:12,724","00:57:15,768","Sadly not, sir.
Cryptography have had no luck."
687,"00:57:15,935","00:57:17,854","It seems like it's a mixture
of two languages,"
688,"00:57:18,062","00:57:21,566","but, as yet, they've failed
to determine which two languages."
689,"00:57:21,733","00:57:23,359",Ottoman and Sumerian.
690,"00:57:25,862","00:57:28,239","Surely, someone else in this room
knew that."
691,"00:57:28,406","00:57:29,490",Who is this woman?
692,"00:57:29,657","00:57:31,367","She's my, um,"
693,"00:57:32,035","00:57:33,077","secretary, sir."
694,"00:57:33,661","00:57:35,913","And she can understand
Ottoman and Sumerian?"
695,"00:57:36,497","00:57:37,957",She's a very good secretary.
696,"00:57:38,124","00:57:39,542",See her out.
697,"00:57:40,168","00:57:42,837","Sir, if this woman can read it,"
698,"00:57:43,004","00:57:44,839",we should hear what she has to say.
699,"00:57:45,006","00:57:46,716","Yes, very well."
700,"00:57:52,597","00:57:54,390",It's a formula
701,"00:57:54,974","00:57:56,434",for a new kind of gas.
702,"00:57:57,018","00:58:00,521","Mustard gas.
Hydrogen-based, instead of sulfur."
703,"00:58:00,688","00:58:01,773",Hydrogen-based...
704,"00:58:01,939","00:58:04,567","Gas masks would be useless
against hydrogen."
705,"00:58:04,734","00:58:07,570",The book says they plan to release the gas
706,"00:58:07,737","00:58:09,072","at ""the front""?"
707,"00:58:09,238","00:58:10,239",When?
708,"00:58:10,406","00:58:11,574",It doesn't say.
709,"00:58:12,033","00:58:13,326","Wait. ""Front"" of what?"
710,"00:58:13,493","00:58:14,494","Sir,"
711,"00:58:14,661","00:58:16,454",that is the evidence we need.
712,"00:58:16,621","00:58:18,081","You have to find out
where they're making that gas."
713,"00:58:18,247","00:58:19,415",You have to burn it to the ground.
714,"00:58:19,582","00:58:20,583",Destroy it.
715,"00:58:20,750","00:58:23,294",Ludendorff was last seen in Belgium.
716,"00:58:23,461","00:58:27,590","We can't be seen sending troops
into German-occupied Belgium"
717,"00:58:27,757","00:58:30,468",as we are negotiating their surrender.
718,"00:58:30,635","00:58:32,387","Sir, I've seen that gas with my own eyes."
719,"00:58:32,553","00:58:35,306","If it is used,
it will kill everyone on both sides."
720,"00:58:35,473","00:58:36,516",They will all die.
721,"00:58:36,683","00:58:39,602","That is what soldiers do, Captain."
722,"00:58:40,436","00:58:42,188","Send me in
with some logistical support."
723,"00:58:42,355","00:58:45,483","At least give me the chance
to take out Ludendorff's operation myself."
724,"00:58:45,650","00:58:46,776",Are you insane?
725,"00:58:46,943","00:58:49,237","I can't introduce rogue elements
this late in the game."
726,"00:58:49,404","00:58:50,405","Sir, I can--"
727,"00:58:50,571","00:58:51,781","Now, more than ever,"
728,"00:58:51,948","00:58:55,618",the armistice is of paramount importance.
729,"00:58:55,785","00:58:59,414","It must be negotiated, it must be signed,
and this is..."
730,"00:59:00,289","00:59:02,959","Well, it's the best way
of stopping the war."
731,"00:59:03,126","00:59:05,128","Captain, you will do nothing."
732,"00:59:05,294","00:59:07,296",And that is an order.
733,"00:59:08,256","00:59:09,257","Yes, sir."
734,"00:59:10,466","00:59:11,467","I understand, sir."
735,"00:59:12,427","00:59:13,469",I don't!
736,"00:59:13,928","00:59:15,263","Diana, I know this is confusing..."
737,"00:59:15,430","00:59:17,473","- It is not confusing! It's unthinkable!
- Who is this woman?"
738,"00:59:17,640","00:59:18,641","She's with me. She's with us, sir."
739,"00:59:18,808","00:59:19,892",I am not with you!
740,"00:59:20,059","00:59:23,146","You would knowingly sacrifice
all those lives,"
741,"00:59:23,312","00:59:24,313",as if they mean less than yours!
742,"00:59:24,480","00:59:26,149","- Diana, let's talk about this outside.
- As if they mean nothing?"
743,"00:59:26,315","00:59:29,652","Where I come from, generals don't
hide in their offices like cowards."
744,"00:59:29,819","00:59:31,946","- That's enough!
- They fight alongside their soldiers."
745,"00:59:32,113","00:59:33,656",They die with them on the battlefield!
746,"00:59:33,823","00:59:35,199","- That's enough!
- You should be ashamed."
747,"00:59:35,366","00:59:37,201","- My apologies. Diana...
- You should be ashamed."
748,"00:59:37,368","00:59:38,745","- Diana...
- All of you should be ashamed!"
749,"00:59:40,163","00:59:41,789",Please slow down!
750,"00:59:41,956","00:59:43,291",That's your leader?
751,"00:59:43,458","00:59:45,626","How could he say that?
Believe that?"
752,"00:59:45,793","00:59:47,211",And you!
753,"00:59:47,378","00:59:49,172",Was your duty to simply give them a book?
754,"00:59:49,338","00:59:50,339",No!
755,"00:59:50,506","00:59:51,674","You didn't stand your ground!
You didn't fight!"
756,"00:59:51,841","00:59:53,301","Because there was no chance
of changing his mind!"
757,"00:59:53,468","00:59:56,137","This is Ares, and he's not going to
allow a negotiation"
758,"00:59:56,304","00:59:57,722",or a surrender!
759,"00:59:57,889","01:00:00,516","The millions of people you talked about,
they will die!"
760,"01:00:00,683","01:00:02,143",We are going anyway!
761,"01:00:04,687","01:00:06,272","You mean, you were lying?"
762,"01:00:06,856","01:00:08,649",I'm a spy! That's what I do!
763,"01:00:08,816","01:00:09,859","How do I know
you're not lying to me right now?"
764,"01:00:15,531","01:00:17,033",I am taking you to the front.
765,"01:00:17,700","01:00:19,744",We are probably going to die.
766,"01:00:20,661","01:00:22,705",This is a terrible idea.
767,"01:00:27,376","01:00:29,337",We're going to need reinforcements.
768,"01:00:39,722","01:00:41,182",These are the reinforcements?
769,"01:00:41,349","01:00:42,767",Yup.
770,"01:00:43,184","01:00:44,936",Are these even good men?
771,"01:00:45,853","01:00:47,063",Hmm. Relatively.
772,"01:00:48,356","01:00:52,068","Even in Africa, gentlemen,
we haven't seen such luxuries."
773,"01:00:52,235","01:00:56,531","But the luxury that we have now...
It's like we can't stop making money!"
774,"01:00:56,697","01:00:58,950","So, my uncle, the prince, and I--"
775,"01:00:59,116","01:01:01,327",Boy! Which prince is that?
776,"01:01:01,869","01:01:03,955","I decide to extend the opportunity
for a few good soldiers--"
777,"01:01:04,121","01:01:05,581","But, seriously, which prince?"
778,"01:01:06,415","01:01:09,418","Hey, Sultan Angora Mynx Cashmere,"
779,"01:01:09,585","01:01:11,254",could I talk to you for a minute?
780,"01:01:11,587","01:01:13,756","Gentlemen,
excuse me one second."
781,"01:01:14,507","01:01:15,508","""Bar."" Well, a ""pub."""
782,"01:01:15,675","01:01:18,928","You bugger. I have been greasing
those peacocks all night, and you..."
783,"01:01:19,971","01:01:21,764","Oh, my goodness gracious."
784,"01:01:22,640","01:01:23,766",That's a work of art.
785,"01:01:23,933","01:01:25,560","Sameer, Diana. Diana, Sameer."
786,"01:01:25,726","01:01:27,895","Hi, Diana.
You can call me Sammy, please."
787,"01:01:28,062","01:01:29,063","""Sammy."""
788,"01:01:29,230","01:01:31,440","Sameer, I wouldn't do that,
if I were you."
789,"01:01:31,607","01:01:32,942",Sameer's a top undercover man.
790,"01:01:33,109","01:01:35,444","He can talk the skin off a cat
in as many languages as you can."
791,"01:01:54,297","01:01:55,381","Oh, you're done."
792,"01:01:55,548","01:01:56,549",Where's Charlie?
793,"01:02:00,469","01:02:01,554",Le voilà.
794,"01:02:04,724","01:02:07,018","At least this ""Charlie""
is good with his fists."
795,"01:02:07,977","01:02:09,186",That's not Charlie.
796,"01:02:17,111","01:02:18,154",That's Charlie.
797,"01:02:22,491","01:02:23,492",Steven!
798,"01:02:23,951","01:02:26,495","May God put a flower upon your head, son."
799,"01:02:26,662","01:02:27,955",Good to see you.
800,"01:02:29,457","01:02:31,500","So, what were you fighting about?"
801,"01:02:32,460","01:02:35,379","I mistook his glass for mine.
It happens."
802,"01:02:35,546","01:02:37,131",This man is no fighter.
803,"01:02:37,298","01:02:39,175",Charlie is an expert marksman.
804,"01:02:39,675","01:02:40,676",It means he shoots people.
805,"01:02:40,843","01:02:42,511",From very far away.
806,"01:02:42,845","01:02:44,305",They never know what hit them.
807,"01:02:45,973","01:02:48,559","So, how do you know who you kill
if you can't see their face?"
808,"01:02:48,726","01:02:50,895","I don't. Trust me, it's better that way."
809,"01:02:51,062","01:02:52,438",You fight without honor.
810,"01:02:53,022","01:02:54,649",Who gets paid for honor? Eh?
811,"01:02:55,983","01:02:57,360","So, what's the job, boss?"
812,"01:02:58,861","01:02:59,987","Uh, two days, tops."
813,"01:03:00,154","01:03:02,573","We need, uh, supplies
and passage to Belgium."
814,"01:03:02,740","01:03:03,824",And what's the going rate?
815,"01:03:03,991","01:03:05,034",Better be a good pay.
816,"01:03:05,201","01:03:07,328","Yeah, well, here's the thing."
817,"01:03:08,162","01:03:10,331","Um, I told you it was going to be quick."
818,"01:03:11,791","01:03:14,335",And there's a lot to be gained by this.
819,"01:03:14,502","01:03:16,379","So, it's for a great cause..."
820,"01:03:16,796","01:03:17,797","Uh, freedom..."
821,"01:03:18,005","01:03:19,006",Hmm.
822,"01:03:19,215","01:03:20,591","Friendship,"
823,"01:03:23,177","01:03:24,178","uh, ending the war, friendship--"
824,"01:03:24,345","01:03:25,680","- Okay, you have no money.
- No."
825,"01:03:33,354","01:03:34,605",What?
826,"01:03:34,772","01:03:35,898",What is this?
827,"01:03:36,065","01:03:37,525",We're going to drop her off at the front.
828,"01:03:37,692","01:03:39,318","- ""Dropping her off""?
- Yeah."
829,"01:03:39,944","01:03:42,196","Listen, sweetheart,
I'm not going to get myself killed"
830,"01:03:42,363","01:03:43,531",helping a wee lassie out of a ditch.
831,"01:03:43,698","01:03:45,741","- Know what I mean?
- Here's the little thief now!"
832,"01:03:45,908","01:03:47,910",We don't need your kind around here.
833,"01:03:58,087","01:03:59,338",She did it!
834,"01:03:59,922","01:04:02,800",I'm both frightened and aroused.
835,"01:04:09,098","01:04:10,725","- Oh, here they are! Sorry I'm late.
- Sir Patrick!"
836,"01:04:10,891","01:04:12,393","Yes, that's what I was going to mention."
837,"01:04:14,270","01:04:16,063","- Sir Patrick.
- Oh, no, no, no."
838,"01:04:16,230","01:04:18,399","Please, gentlemen, sit.
Miss Prince, sit."
839,"01:04:22,611","01:04:24,822",I assume you're here planning something
840,"01:04:24,989","01:04:28,159","that's going to get you either
court-martialed or killed."
841,"01:04:28,325","01:04:30,202",And I assume you're here to stop us.
842,"01:04:30,828","01:04:31,954",No.
843,"01:04:32,121","01:04:33,789","Not at all, in fact."
844,"01:04:34,790","01:04:35,791","Well, look."
845,"01:04:35,958","01:04:37,251","I was a younger man, once."
846,"01:04:37,418","01:04:40,421","And, had I been in better health, I'd like
to think that I might do the same."
847,"01:04:40,629","01:04:41,630",Hmm.
848,"01:04:41,839","01:04:44,091","It's a very,
very honorable thing you're doing."
849,"01:04:44,258","01:04:45,259","Therefore,"
850,"01:04:46,469","01:04:47,803",I'm here to help.
851,"01:04:48,471","01:04:49,847","Unofficially, of course."
852,"01:04:50,973","01:04:52,183",What's your plan?
853,"01:04:53,601","01:04:56,645","If there's another weapons facility,
find it and destroy it."
854,"01:04:57,146","01:04:59,106",Along with Ludendorff and Maru.
855,"01:05:00,357","01:05:03,110","In that case, to allay suspicion,"
856,"01:05:03,778","01:05:07,907","the charming Etta, here,
could, uh, run the mission from my office."
857,"01:05:08,491","01:05:09,492","""Run""..."
858,"01:05:11,702","01:05:12,703","Also,"
859,"01:05:13,662","01:05:16,165",there's enough here for a few days.
860,"01:05:21,670","01:05:22,713","Thank you, sir."
861,"01:05:22,880","01:05:24,465",You're very welcome.
862,"01:05:25,007","01:05:27,051","Take great care, all of you,"
863,"01:05:27,218","01:05:28,219",and good luck.
864,"01:05:39,563","01:05:40,564",Cheers!
865,"01:05:49,615","01:05:51,534","Fresh ice cream, made today. Hello, miss."
866,"01:05:51,700","01:05:53,035",Would you like to buy an ice cream?
867,"01:05:53,202","01:05:54,787","- Me?
- Are you hungry?"
868,"01:05:54,954","01:05:55,955",Yes.
869,"01:05:56,163","01:05:57,373",Thank you.
870,"01:05:57,540","01:05:58,582","Eight pence, please, sir."
871,"01:05:58,749","01:06:00,042","Here you go, pal. Keep the change."
872,"01:06:00,209","01:06:02,378","- Thank you very much, sir.
- Mmm."
873,"01:06:02,586","01:06:04,046","- What do you think?
- It's wonderful!"
874,"01:06:04,213","01:06:05,214",Yeah.
875,"01:06:06,382","01:06:08,843","- You should be very proud.
- Thank you very much!"
876,"01:06:09,009","01:06:10,386",You should be very proud.
877,"01:06:13,722","01:06:17,059",It's a long way to Tipperary
878,"01:06:17,226","01:06:20,604",It's a long way to go
879,"01:06:20,771","01:06:24,024","I hope our guy meets us here.
Chief's expecting us before dark."
880,"01:06:24,733","01:06:25,776","""Chief""?"
881,"01:06:26,777","01:06:28,404","Uh, yeah. A smuggler."
882,"01:06:29,238","01:06:30,698",Very reputable.
883,"01:06:31,073","01:06:34,201","A liar, a murderer, and now a smuggler."
884,"01:06:34,743","01:06:35,744",Lovely.
885,"01:06:36,245","01:06:37,538","Careful, I might get offended."
886,"01:06:37,705","01:06:39,248",I wasn't referring to you.
887,"01:06:39,707","01:06:40,708",Really?
888,"01:06:40,958","01:06:42,918","I went undercover
and pretended to be somebody else,"
889,"01:06:43,085","01:06:44,753","shot people on your beach,
and smuggled a notebook."
890,"01:06:44,920","01:06:47,423","Liar, murderer, smuggler.
Are you still coming?"
891,"01:07:07,067","01:07:08,068",It's awful.
892,"01:07:09,445","01:07:10,946",That's why we're here.
893,"01:07:29,006","01:07:30,799",The gas will kill everything.
894,"01:07:30,966","01:07:33,677",What kind of weapon kills innocents?
895,"01:07:34,136","01:07:35,679","In this war,"
896,"01:07:35,846","01:07:37,181",every kind.
897,"01:07:42,686","01:07:45,189","You were absent
at the council meeting, General."
898,"01:07:45,356","01:07:48,067","I see you are negotiating the terms
of the armistice without me."
899,"01:07:48,234","01:07:50,986","- On the Kaiser's behalf.
- And on your insistence!"
900,"01:07:51,528","01:07:54,615","We could easily win this war,
if only you had a little faith."
901,"01:07:54,782","01:07:56,075",We don't.
902,"01:07:56,242","01:07:57,910","There are shortages of food,"
903,"01:07:58,077","01:07:59,870","medicine, ammunition."
904,"01:08:00,996","01:08:04,750","Every hour we delay
costs thousands of German lives."
905,"01:08:04,917","01:08:07,586",One attack and the war can be ours!
906,"01:08:10,256","01:08:12,091","As we speak, my chemist--"
907,"01:08:12,258","01:08:14,468",We stand against you and your
908,"01:08:14,760","01:08:15,761",witch.
909,"01:08:16,220","01:08:18,097","Ludendorff, enough!"
910,"01:08:19,473","01:08:21,433","Twenty-four hours from now,"
911,"01:08:21,600","01:08:23,686",this war will end.
912,"01:08:24,270","01:08:25,771",It is over.
913,"01:08:26,981","01:08:28,565",It is over for you.
914,"01:08:32,194","01:08:33,737",It is over for all of you.
915,"01:08:50,629","01:08:51,964",But the mask won't help.
916,"01:08:52,131","01:08:54,008",They don't know that.
917,"01:09:08,981","01:09:09,982",Let's go!
918,"01:09:10,149","01:09:12,443","Time to stage a demonstration
for the Kaiser!"
919,"01:09:14,903","01:09:15,946",You're late.
920,"01:09:16,113","01:09:17,489","Cowboy sneak-attack, Chief!"
921,"01:09:18,490","01:09:19,491",How are you?
922,"01:09:20,326","01:09:21,827","- Good to see you, pal.
- Okay, big man!"
923,"01:09:24,663","01:09:26,498","- Good to see you.
- Ah, yes!"
924,"01:09:27,249","01:09:28,751","Good to see you, my friend."
925,"01:09:29,668","01:09:30,919",You beauty!
926,"01:09:31,670","01:09:33,047",Who is this?
927,"01:09:39,845","01:09:41,472",And I am Diana.
928,"01:09:42,348","01:09:43,390",Where did you find her?
929,"01:09:43,932","01:09:45,100",She found me.
930,"01:09:45,684","01:09:47,978","- I plucked him from the sea.
- It's a long story."
931,"01:09:48,145","01:09:49,229",We don't have to talk about that right now.
932,"01:09:49,396","01:09:50,814",What's there?
933,"01:09:51,982","01:09:53,984","British tea for the Germans,"
934,"01:09:54,151","01:09:56,111",German beer for the British.
935,"01:09:57,821","01:10:00,199",And Edgar Rice Burroughs novels for both.
936,"01:10:00,366","01:10:01,408",And guns!
937,"01:10:03,369","01:10:06,288","Well, may we get what we want!"
938,"01:10:06,455","01:10:07,790",May we get what we need.
939,"01:10:07,956","01:10:10,209",But may we never get what we deserve.
940,"01:10:10,376","01:10:11,752",Bang!
941,"01:10:18,675","01:10:20,010",Strange thunder.
942,"01:10:21,553","01:10:23,055",German 77s.
943,"01:10:23,389","01:10:24,723",Guns. Big ones.
944,"01:10:25,974","01:10:27,309","It's the front, out there."
945,"01:10:28,644","01:10:30,020",The evening hate.
946,"01:10:30,729","01:10:32,648","So, who do you fight for in this war?"
947,"01:10:32,815","01:10:33,982",I don't fight.
948,"01:10:34,149","01:10:36,151","You're here for profit, then?"
949,"01:10:36,527","01:10:38,529",No better place to be.
950,"01:10:39,863","01:10:41,990","Nowhere better to be than in a war
where you don't take a side?"
951,"01:10:42,157","01:10:43,325",I have nowhere else.
952,"01:10:43,867","01:10:45,327","The last war
took everything from my people."
953,"01:10:45,494","01:10:46,787",We have nothing left.
954,"01:10:47,663","01:10:48,872","At least here,"
955,"01:10:49,665","01:10:51,083",I'm free.
956,"01:10:51,667","01:10:53,544",Who took that from your people?
957,"01:10:54,169","01:10:55,504",His people.
958,"01:11:00,551","01:11:01,552",Don't go...
959,"01:11:02,261","01:11:04,888",Don't go in. Don't go!
960,"01:11:05,055","01:11:07,349","Don't! Boys, no!"
961,"01:11:07,516","01:11:08,517",Don't go in there!
962,"01:11:08,684","01:11:10,144",Shh. You're safe.
963,"01:11:10,310","01:11:12,479",You're safe. Are you okay?
964,"01:11:12,646","01:11:13,981","Get off me, woman!"
965,"01:11:14,148","01:11:15,691",Stop making a fuss!
966,"01:11:16,024","01:11:17,192",God!
967,"01:11:21,280","01:11:23,657",He sees ghosts.
968,"01:11:28,662","01:11:29,746",You're going to get cold.
969,"01:11:29,913","01:11:31,039","Oh, I don't..."
970,"01:11:31,498","01:11:33,876","Don't worry about Charlie.
He doesn't mean anything by it."
971,"01:11:49,308","01:11:51,477","Get out of there, now.
We've got to move!"
972,"01:11:51,643","01:11:54,062","You bloody animal, move!
Go on! Get on!"
973,"01:11:54,229","01:11:56,190","These animals,
why are they hurting them?"
974,"01:11:56,356","01:11:58,358","Because they need to move, quick!"
975,"01:11:58,525","01:12:00,194","- Like us!
- But this is not the way."
976,"01:12:00,903","01:12:02,446",I could help them.
977,"01:12:02,654","01:12:03,906","There's no time. Come on, woman!"
978,"01:12:07,075","01:12:08,202",Mama!
979,"01:12:12,998","01:12:14,917",That man... He's wounded.
980,"01:12:15,083","01:12:17,127","There is nothing you can do
about it, Diana."
981,"01:12:17,294","01:12:18,837",We must keep moving!
982,"01:12:39,858","01:12:41,109",What is this?
983,"01:12:41,276","01:12:43,320","You wanted me to take you to the war.
This is it."
984,"01:12:43,487","01:12:44,863","So, where are the Germans?"
985,"01:12:45,030","01:12:47,449",A couple hundred yards across the field.
986,"01:12:47,616","01:12:48,951","- Their trench is...
- Watch out!"
987,"01:12:51,578","01:12:53,747",Chief! It's good to see you!
988,"01:12:53,914","01:12:56,124",Oi! Chief's back! He's back!
989,"01:12:57,584","01:12:58,752","All right, let's move!"
990,"01:13:14,560","01:13:17,145","- Diana, we have to go.
- We need to help these people."
991,"01:13:17,312","01:13:18,313",We have to stay on-mission.
992,"01:13:18,480","01:13:19,815","The next safe crossing
is at least a day away."
993,"01:13:19,982","01:13:22,401","- What are we waiting for?
- We cannot leave without helping them."
994,"01:13:22,568","01:13:24,152",These people are dying.
995,"01:13:24,319","01:13:25,988","They have nothing to eat,
and in the village..."
996,"01:13:26,154","01:13:27,573","- Enslaved, she said!
- I understand that."
997,"01:13:27,739","01:13:28,740",Women and children!
998,"01:13:28,907","01:13:30,117","We need to make
our next position by sundown."
999,"01:13:30,284","01:13:32,452","How can you say that?
What is the matter with you?"
1000,"01:13:32,619","01:13:34,663","This is No Man's Land, Diana!"
1001,"01:13:35,247","01:13:37,124","It means no man can cross it,
all right?"
1002,"01:13:37,291","01:13:39,626","This battalion has been here
for nearly a year"
1003,"01:13:39,793","01:13:42,170",and they barely gained an inch.
1004,"01:13:42,337","01:13:45,632","Because, on the other side,
there are a bunch of Germans"
1005,"01:13:45,799","01:13:47,968","pointing machine guns at
every square inch of this place."
1006,"01:13:48,135","01:13:50,387","This is not something you can cross.
It's not possible."
1007,"01:13:50,554","01:13:51,930","So what? So, we do nothing?"
1008,"01:13:52,097","01:13:53,849","No, we are doing something.
We are."
1009,"01:13:54,016","01:13:55,309","- We just...
- Steve."
1010,"01:13:55,475","01:13:56,893",We can't save everyone in this war.
1011,"01:13:57,060","01:13:58,270","Steve, Steve..."
1012,"01:13:58,979","01:14:00,397",This is not what we came here to do.
1013,"01:14:16,496","01:14:17,497","No,"
1014,"01:14:17,664","01:14:19,666",but it's what I'm going to do.
1015,"01:14:34,890","01:14:36,224",Diana!
1016,"01:14:58,413","01:15:00,707",What the bloody hell is she playing at?
1017,"01:15:17,099","01:15:19,476","She's taking all the fire!
Let's go!"
1018,"01:15:22,979","01:15:25,065",Stay down! Stay down!
1019,"01:15:25,232","01:15:26,608",That's an order!
1020,"01:16:19,828","01:16:20,662","Go, now!"
1021,"01:16:20,829","01:16:22,748","She's done it!
She's got them on the run!"
1022,"01:16:26,626","01:16:28,837","Get down, get down! She's done it!"
1023,"01:16:42,559","01:16:43,977",Steve!
1024,"01:16:44,186","01:16:45,270",Let's go!
1025,"01:16:48,064","01:16:49,775","Come on, go!"
1026,"01:17:10,045","01:17:11,630",Stay here. I'll go ahead.
1027,"01:17:47,249","01:17:48,625","- What the...
- Let's move!"
1028,"01:18:26,955","01:18:28,456",We need more firepower.
1029,"01:19:44,574","01:19:45,659",Sniper!
1030,"01:19:45,825","01:19:47,118",Go!
1031,"01:19:49,329","01:19:50,330",Get in!
1032,"01:19:50,497","01:19:51,957","Charlie, bell tower!"
1033,"01:20:00,173","01:20:01,174","Come on, Charlie. Shoot him!"
1034,"01:20:02,425","01:20:04,386","Hey, it's okay."
1035,"01:20:06,721","01:20:07,722",Huh.
1036,"01:20:09,516","01:20:11,518",Follow me! Give me some cover!
1037,"01:20:17,691","01:20:19,401",Right!
1038,"01:20:19,567","01:20:22,278","We're going to put this on our backs,
and, when I say go,"
1039,"01:20:22,445","01:20:23,405","- lift hard!
- Okay."
1040,"01:20:24,447","01:20:26,324",Diana! Shield!
1041,"01:20:30,412","01:20:31,913",Go!
1042,"01:21:33,600","01:21:35,643","Stay very,
very still for me, my friends."
1043,"01:21:35,810","01:21:37,437",Please. So important.
1044,"01:21:41,149","01:21:42,442",Thank you very much.
1045,"01:21:42,609","01:21:45,320","This has been such an honor for me,
taking your photograph."
1046,"01:21:45,487","01:21:46,529",Thank you so much.
1047,"01:21:52,952","01:21:55,246","For all his talk of shooting,"
1048,"01:21:55,413","01:21:56,998",he cannot shoot.
1049,"01:22:00,085","01:22:02,629","Not everyone gets to be
what they want to be all the time."
1050,"01:22:03,171","01:22:05,590","Me, I am an actor."
1051,"01:22:05,757","01:22:07,133",I love acting.
1052,"01:22:07,300","01:22:09,010",I didn't want to be a soldier.
1053,"01:22:10,178","01:22:11,638",But I'm the wrong color.
1054,"01:22:12,597","01:22:14,933","Everyone is fighting their own battles,
Diana."
1055,"01:22:16,351","01:22:17,811",Just as you are fighting yours.
1056,"01:22:24,025","01:22:25,652","It's too much.
I wish you well."
1057,"01:22:25,819","01:22:26,820","Thank you, thank you."
1058,"01:22:30,990","01:22:32,534",I'm on the... On the phone--
1059,"01:22:33,034","01:22:35,537","Uh, it's ""Veld."" V-E-L-D."
1060,"01:22:35,703","01:22:37,247",It's a tiny village.
1061,"01:22:37,413","01:22:39,207",It may not even be on the map.
1062,"01:22:39,374","01:22:40,708",Ooh! I found it! I found it!
1063,"01:22:41,251","01:22:42,836",Did you find Ludendorff's operation?
1064,"01:22:43,002","01:22:44,838","No, no, no. But I located him."
1065,"01:22:45,004","01:22:47,465","And, oh, lucky you,
he's only a few miles away,"
1066,"01:22:47,632","01:22:49,467",at German High Command.
1067,"01:22:49,884","01:22:51,553","German High Command, huh?"
1068,"01:22:51,719","01:22:53,346","So, intel reports"
1069,"01:22:53,513","01:22:55,682",that Ludendorff is hosting a gala.
1070,"01:22:55,849","01:22:57,225","A sort of ""last hurrah"""
1071,"01:22:57,392","01:22:59,686",before the Germans sign the armistice.
1072,"01:22:59,853","01:23:02,564","And the Kaiser himself
is going to be there."
1073,"01:23:03,064","01:23:05,608",As well as Dr. Maru.
1074,"01:23:06,234","01:23:07,694","Actually, the gala could be perfect cover."
1075,"01:23:07,861","01:23:09,571","- Captain Trevor.
- Yes, sir."
1076,"01:23:09,737","01:23:12,323","You are, under no circumstances,
to go anywhere near"
1077,"01:23:12,490","01:23:14,534","that gala tomorrow night.
Do you hear me?"
1078,"01:23:14,701","01:23:16,703","You'd be jeopardizing
everything we've worked for."
1079,"01:23:16,870","01:23:19,205",You cannot compromise the armistice.
1080,"01:23:19,372","01:23:20,999","- Sir, there will be no armistice...
- Steve!"
1081,"01:23:21,166","01:23:23,001","...once Ludendorff bombs
the entire front line."
1082,"01:23:23,168","01:23:24,169","Hold on one second, sir."
1083,"01:23:24,335","01:23:26,212","You shouldn't be bothered
about upsetting the peace accord."
1084,"01:23:26,379","01:23:28,214","- Why not?
- Ares would never let..."
1085,"01:23:28,673","01:23:29,674",What?
1086,"01:23:30,216","01:23:31,217",What is it?
1087,"01:23:31,759","01:23:33,720",Of course. It makes complete sense.
1088,"01:23:35,221","01:23:38,308","Ares developed a weapon,
the worst ever devised."
1089,"01:23:38,474","01:23:40,226","- Ares? You mean Ludendorff.
- No."
1090,"01:23:40,768","01:23:42,187",I mean Ares.
1091,"01:23:42,770","01:23:44,189",Ludendorff is Ares!
1092,"01:23:45,815","01:23:47,567","Sir, this is our last chance,"
1093,"01:23:47,734","01:23:49,485","our final chance
to find out where the gas is"
1094,"01:23:49,652","01:23:51,446","and to learn how Ludendorff
plans on delivering it."
1095,"01:23:51,613","01:23:53,364","No, no, no. I forbid it."
1096,"01:23:53,531","01:23:54,741",Do you hear me? I forbid it.
1097,"01:23:54,908","01:23:56,784","Sir, I'm losing you! Sir?"
1098,"01:23:56,951","01:23:57,952","- Hello?
- Sir..."
1099,"01:24:01,247","01:24:02,957",How likely is he to respect my wishes?
1100,"01:24:03,124","01:24:05,293","Not very likely, I'll be honest."
1101,"01:24:11,591","01:24:13,259","Sammy. Sammy, no. No, no, no."
1102,"01:24:13,426","01:24:15,303","Sammy, I have to work."
1103,"01:24:15,470","01:24:16,638",I gotta rustle up a German uniform.
1104,"01:24:16,804","01:24:18,097","I still have to plot the course
for tomorrow."
1105,"01:24:18,264","01:24:19,891","That's easy, boss. Come on."
1106,"01:24:20,058","01:24:21,434",There is nothing we can do until tomorrow.
1107,"01:24:21,601","01:24:22,644","You said it yourself, Steve."
1108,"01:24:22,810","01:24:24,812","So... Madame, s'il vous plaît."
1109,"01:24:24,979","01:24:25,980",Incroyable!
1110,"01:24:26,731","01:24:28,233",Magnifique!
1111,"01:24:28,441","01:24:29,442","- Thank you.
- Thank you."
1112,"01:24:29,609","01:24:30,818","Monsieur, s'il vous plaît."
1113,"01:24:32,946","01:24:34,364","- Et voilà!
- Merci, Sammy."
1114,"01:24:34,530","01:24:35,531",Et voilà!
1115,"01:24:47,877","01:24:49,170",You did this.
1116,"01:24:51,464","01:24:52,465",We did.
1117,"01:24:57,428","01:24:58,846",Do you have dancing on
1118,"01:24:59,722","01:25:01,015",Paradise Island?
1119,"01:25:01,182","01:25:02,976","Dancing, yeah. Of course."
1120,"01:25:03,142","01:25:07,188",But these people are just swaying.
1121,"01:25:08,022","01:25:11,401","Okay, if you're going to be fighting
the God of War,"
1122,"01:25:11,567","01:25:14,529","I may as well teach you how to dance,
you poor thing."
1123,"01:25:14,696","01:25:17,365","All right, probably without the gun."
1124,"01:25:17,532","01:25:18,783",Madame.
1125,"01:25:21,536","01:25:23,079",If you would.
1126,"01:25:23,746","01:25:24,747",Well...
1127,"01:25:26,499","01:25:28,710","If I'm going to a gala,
I'll need to know how to dance."
1128,"01:25:28,876","01:25:30,586","- You're not going to the gala.
- Of course I am."
1129,"01:25:30,753","01:25:32,630","- No, you're not.
- Why wouldn't I?"
1130,"01:25:32,797","01:25:34,799","Well, for one,
you don't know how to dance."
1131,"01:25:35,341","01:25:37,719","I would argue that
they don't know how to dance."
1132,"01:25:37,885","01:25:39,178","Be polite, be polite."
1133,"01:25:41,889","01:25:44,309","All right. So, give me your hand."
1134,"01:25:44,475","01:25:45,518",Like so.
1135,"01:25:46,227","01:25:49,439",And I'm gonna put my arm
1136,"01:25:49,605","01:25:51,357","around you, like so."
1137,"01:25:52,025","01:25:53,985",And we just...
1138,"01:25:54,152","01:25:55,611","What did you call it? ""Sway""?"
1139,"01:25:55,778","01:25:56,904",Then you just sway.
1140,"01:25:57,488","01:25:58,990",You're awfully close.
1141,"01:26:01,117","01:26:03,244",That's what it's all about.
1142,"01:26:06,122","01:26:07,332",I see.
1143,"01:26:16,299","01:26:18,551",I haven't heard him sing in years.
1144,"01:26:35,068","01:26:37,904","It's, uh... It's a snowfall."
1145,"01:26:42,283","01:26:43,284",Touch it.
1146,"01:26:46,412","01:26:47,914",It's magical!
1147,"01:26:48,915","01:26:50,625","It is, isn't it?"
1148,"01:26:52,668","01:26:54,087","It is, yeah."
1149,"01:27:00,635","01:27:04,055","Is this what people do
when there are no wars to fight?"
1150,"01:27:04,764","01:27:05,765",Yeah.
1151,"01:27:07,058","01:27:10,144","Yeah, this and other things."
1152,"01:27:10,311","01:27:11,729",What things?
1153,"01:27:13,648","01:27:14,649",Um...
1154,"01:27:19,153","01:27:20,655",They have breakfast.
1155,"01:27:21,239","01:27:22,865",They really love a breakfast.
1156,"01:27:23,032","01:27:25,576","And, um, they love to wake up"
1157,"01:27:26,536","01:27:28,746",and read the paper and go to work.
1158,"01:27:29,831","01:27:31,582",They get married.
1159,"01:27:32,208","01:27:33,960","Make some babies,
grow old together."
1160,"01:27:34,710","01:27:35,795",I guess.
1161,"01:27:39,757","01:27:41,259",What is it like?
1162,"01:27:45,263","01:27:46,764",I have no idea.
1163,"01:29:21,734","01:29:23,152",The villagers gave them to us.
1164,"01:29:24,070","01:29:26,781","- A gracious gift.
- And they call us heroes."
1165,"01:29:26,948","01:29:27,949",You are.
1166,"01:29:28,741","01:29:30,535","Hey, fellas. I know that"
1167,"01:29:31,786","01:29:33,454","I said this job was two days,"
1168,"01:29:35,665","01:29:36,749",and a deal's a deal.
1169,"01:29:39,001","01:29:40,503",You'd get lost without us.
1170,"01:29:41,420","01:29:42,421",Yeah.
1171,"01:29:43,214","01:29:45,007","We all know Diana is capable
of taking care of herself."
1172,"01:29:45,591","01:29:47,176",I'm worried that you won't make it.
1173,"01:29:47,343","01:29:48,636",There's no more money.
1174,"01:29:48,803","01:29:50,221",We've been paid enough.
1175,"01:29:50,805","01:29:52,723","Maybe you're better off without me, yeah?"
1176,"01:29:53,724","01:29:55,309","No, Charlie."
1177,"01:29:56,769","01:29:58,854",Who will sing for us?
1178,"01:29:59,647","01:30:01,774","- Yeah.
- Oh, no, please."
1179,"01:30:02,650","01:30:03,901",Sing?
1180,"01:30:04,110","01:30:05,820",You asked for it.
1181,"01:30:05,987","01:30:09,115","Green grow the rashes, O"
1182,"01:30:09,407","01:30:12,994","Green grow the rashes, O"
1183,"01:30:13,160","01:30:16,831",The sweetest hours I e'er did spend
1184,"01:30:17,832","01:30:20,001",You must think I was born yesterday.
1185,"01:30:20,167","01:30:22,044","I know it sounds crazy,
but it's true."
1186,"01:30:22,211","01:30:23,379",Every word.
1187,"01:30:23,754","01:30:25,131","Wait, wait, wait."
1188,"01:30:25,298","01:30:27,216",There is a whole island of women like her?
1189,"01:30:27,383","01:30:29,176",And not a single man among them?
1190,"01:30:30,177","01:30:31,429",How do we get there?
1191,"01:30:31,721","01:30:33,681",And she thinks
1192,"01:30:33,848","01:30:35,891","that Ludendorff is Ares, the God of War?"
1193,"01:30:36,058","01:30:38,936","And only by killing him
will the war end? Don't be daft."
1194,"01:30:39,103","01:30:40,521",You saw what happened out there.
1195,"01:30:41,022","01:30:43,107","The way she charged
that machine-gun nest?"
1196,"01:30:43,274","01:30:45,067",The way she took out that tower?
1197,"01:30:46,569","01:30:47,903",Maybe it's true.
1198,"01:30:49,071","01:30:50,406",I think it's true.
1199,"01:30:50,865","01:30:51,907",I believe it's true.
1200,"01:30:52,074","01:30:53,075",Et voilà.
1201,"01:30:53,242","01:30:57,038","Steven, son, you don't really believe
this rubbish, do you?"
1202,"01:31:20,227","01:31:22,563","Diana! Diana!
Hiding, hiding."
1203,"01:31:24,398","01:31:25,816",How the hell do we get into that?
1204,"01:31:26,901","01:31:29,654","I see only a couple of guards
on the door to distract."
1205,"01:31:29,862","01:31:31,238","Yeah, it won't look suspicious at all"
1206,"01:31:31,405","01:31:32,907","when I come sauntering
out of the woods on foot."
1207,"01:31:33,074","01:31:34,075",I could get in.
1208,"01:31:34,241","01:31:35,743",You're not going in. It's too dangerous.
1209,"01:31:35,910","01:31:37,495","- Too dangerous?
- Yes, too dangerous."
1210,"01:31:37,662","01:31:38,746",And you're too distracting.
1211,"01:31:38,913","01:31:41,374","So, look, I'll go in there,
and follow them"
1212,"01:31:41,540","01:31:43,959","to wherever they're working on the gas
or, better yet, where it is."
1213,"01:31:44,168","01:31:45,419","- Then I'm coming with you.
- No, you're not!"
1214,"01:31:45,586","01:31:48,422","What you're wearing
isn't exactly undercover."
1215,"01:31:48,589","01:31:49,590",I don't know.
1216,"01:31:49,757","01:31:51,592","I would say she was pretty undercover
on that battlefield."
1217,"01:31:51,759","01:31:53,803","We just...
We can't get you in, okay?"
1218,"01:31:53,969","01:31:55,388","So, I'll scout it out, report back, and--"
1219,"01:31:55,554","01:31:57,431","But as long as he's still alive,
it doesn't--"
1220,"01:31:57,598","01:32:00,059","You cannot go into German High Command
and kill anyone."
1221,"01:32:00,226","01:32:02,103",You just can't. You have to trust me.
1222,"01:32:03,437","01:32:05,272","- Oh, wow!
- Where did that come from?"
1223,"01:32:05,439","01:32:07,483","Oh, can I drive it?
Please, let me drive it!"
1224,"01:32:07,650","01:32:08,901",I'll be your chauffeur.
1225,"01:32:09,068","01:32:10,277","Come on, come on."
1226,"01:32:11,028","01:32:12,029",Stay put!
1227,"01:32:12,863","01:32:13,864",Where did this come from?
1228,"01:32:14,031","01:32:16,200",A field over there. It's full of them!
1229,"01:32:20,788","01:32:21,872","Chief, I say you and me scope out the area"
1230,"01:32:22,039","01:32:23,582",in case we need to beat a hasty retreat.
1231,"01:32:23,749","01:32:26,127","- What do you say, Diana?
- Huh?"
1232,"01:32:30,631","01:32:31,841",Colonel.
1233,"01:32:35,803","01:32:38,389","Steve, they have invitations."
1234,"01:32:39,807","01:32:42,184","Don't worry, play it cool.
You got this. You got this."
1235,"01:32:46,480","01:32:47,523","Your invitation, please."
1236,"01:32:47,690","01:32:48,691","Dhanyavaad, sahib."
1237,"01:32:48,899","01:32:50,484",The colonel and I wish for many blessings
1238,"01:32:50,651","01:32:52,737","and all manner of other things
to fall upon your head."
1239,"01:32:52,903","01:32:54,447",Your head must be empty.
1240,"01:32:54,655","01:32:56,532","He wants my invitation, you idiot."
1241,"01:32:56,699","01:32:57,867",I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.
1242,"01:32:58,033","01:33:00,494","I must apologize
a thousand, thousand times, my master."
1243,"01:33:00,703","01:33:03,664","I make the most horrible,
the most unforgivable mistake."
1244,"01:33:03,831","01:33:04,957",I lost the colonel's invitation.
1245,"01:33:05,124","01:33:06,125",What?
1246,"01:33:06,292","01:33:09,003","Are you saying we drove all the way
through the mud and rain"
1247,"01:33:09,170","01:33:10,755","- only for you to lose my invitation?
- I'm a snail."
1248,"01:33:10,921","01:33:12,006",No! I'm a bug.
1249,"01:33:12,173","01:33:14,049","Not even a bug.
I am the dung of a bug!"
1250,"01:33:14,216","01:33:15,468","And you're right, master..."
1251,"01:33:16,177","01:33:17,511",Blessing be upon us.
1252,"01:33:28,230","01:33:29,607",This is ridiculous.
1253,"01:33:29,774","01:33:31,942","I'm not going to spend
the entire evening out here,"
1254,"01:33:32,109","01:33:34,195",you stupid idiots! Move your cars!
1255,"01:33:55,424","01:33:56,926",What are you supposed to be?
1256,"01:34:00,596","01:34:02,223",What are you doing?
1257,"01:34:27,039","01:34:28,082",Excuse me.
1258,"01:34:30,918","01:34:32,253",I don't drink.
1259,"01:34:40,427","01:34:41,595",Have we met?
1260,"01:34:41,762","01:34:43,597","No, but I've been watching you."
1261,"01:34:44,598","01:34:46,058","Following your career, I mean."
1262,"01:34:47,434","01:34:49,937",You are Dr. Isabel Maru.
1263,"01:34:50,104","01:34:52,648","The most talented chemist
in the German Army."
1264,"01:34:52,815","01:34:54,441",I am a fan.
1265,"01:35:05,327","01:35:07,454",I hope I am not crossing a line.
1266,"01:35:08,956","01:35:11,375",I know you and General Ludendorff are
1267,"01:35:11,542","01:35:12,585",very close.
1268,"01:35:12,751","01:35:16,005",We work well together. Yes.
1269,"01:35:16,839","01:35:19,800","But having someone like me behind you,"
1270,"01:35:20,467","01:35:22,094",I could provide a lot more.
1271,"01:35:22,261","01:35:24,138",And who are you?
1272,"01:35:24,722","01:35:28,684","A man who would show you appreciation
a genius like yourself deserves."
1273,"01:35:35,149","01:35:37,651",I love fire. Don't you?
1274,"01:35:40,154","01:35:41,822",It is like
1275,"01:35:43,157","01:35:45,284",a living act of entropy.
1276,"01:35:45,451","01:35:47,828",The ultimate weapon of destruction.
1277,"01:35:48,746","01:35:50,956","Reminding us that, in the end,"
1278,"01:35:51,457","01:35:54,835","everything eventually
returns to the ash it came from."
1279,"01:35:57,338","01:35:59,798",There is something reassuring about it.
1280,"01:36:05,095","01:36:07,306",I see all of that in your eyes.
1281,"01:36:10,768","01:36:13,062","Perhaps you could show me
what you're working on."
1282,"01:36:29,119","01:36:30,621",I hear it is...
1283,"01:36:32,873","01:36:35,125",I hear it is extraordinary.
1284,"01:36:35,918","01:36:39,588","I appreciate your interest in my work,"
1285,"01:36:39,755","01:36:42,049",but I am loyal to General Ludendorff.
1286,"01:36:42,216","01:36:43,217","Besides,"
1287,"01:36:43,759","01:36:46,470",now I see your attention is
1288,"01:36:49,640","01:36:50,683",elsewhere.
1289,"01:37:14,707","01:37:16,583",Enjoying the party?
1290,"01:37:18,585","01:37:21,588","I confess, I'm not sure what it is
we're celebrating."
1291,"01:37:21,755","01:37:24,508","A German victory, of course."
1292,"01:37:24,675","01:37:25,676",Victory?
1293,"01:37:25,843","01:37:28,053",When I hear peace could be so close.
1294,"01:37:28,262","01:37:29,263",Peace?
1295,"01:37:29,430","01:37:31,557",There's only an armistice
1296,"01:37:31,724","01:37:33,726",in an endless war.
1297,"01:37:33,892","01:37:35,269",Thucydides.
1298,"01:37:35,477","01:37:37,438",Ah! You know your Ancient Greeks.
1299,"01:37:37,604","01:37:39,440",They understood
1300,"01:37:39,606","01:37:41,942",that war is a god.
1301,"01:37:42,109","01:37:43,777",A god that requires human sacrifice.
1302,"01:37:43,944","01:37:45,863","And in exchange,"
1303,"01:37:46,030","01:37:47,781","war gives man purpose,"
1304,"01:37:48,365","01:37:50,576","meaning, a chance to rise above"
1305,"01:37:50,743","01:37:53,037","his petty, mortal, little self"
1306,"01:37:53,620","01:37:54,913","and be courageous,"
1307,"01:37:55,664","01:37:57,166","noble, better!"
1308,"01:37:58,167","01:38:01,462",Only one of the many gods believed in that.
1309,"01:38:01,879","01:38:04,048","- Mmm.
- And he was wrong."
1310,"01:38:05,257","01:38:07,176",You know nothing of the gods.
1311,"01:38:07,342","01:38:08,552",Herr General.
1312,"01:38:11,472","01:38:13,015",Enjoy the fireworks.
1313,"01:38:18,562","01:38:19,646",What are you doing?
1314,"01:38:19,813","01:38:21,190","- Out of my way!
- Diana, look at me."
1315,"01:38:21,356","01:38:23,025","If you kill Ludendorff
before we find the gas,"
1316,"01:38:23,192","01:38:24,401",we won't be able to stop anything.
1317,"01:38:24,568","01:38:25,569",I will stop Ares!
1318,"01:38:25,736","01:38:26,820",What if you're wrong?
1319,"01:38:28,489","01:38:30,157",What if there is no Ares?
1320,"01:38:31,950","01:38:33,327",You don't believe me.
1321,"01:38:33,869","01:38:35,537",I can't let you do this.
1322,"01:38:36,121","01:38:37,414",What I do is not up to you.
1323,"01:38:44,213","01:38:45,297",Diana!
1324,"01:38:49,718","01:38:50,969",Diana...
1325,"01:38:51,136","01:38:52,221",It's the gas.
1326,"01:38:52,387","01:38:54,431",The village... The village!
1327,"01:38:57,392","01:38:58,977",What are they cheering for?
1328,"01:39:01,522","01:39:02,689",Diana!
1329,"01:39:05,109","01:39:06,735",What did they fire?
1330,"01:39:06,902","01:39:07,903",The gas.
1331,"01:39:08,070","01:39:09,613","- It was Ludendorff.
- I saw him. He was in the tower."
1332,"01:39:09,780","01:39:11,949","Wherever he goes, you follow."
1333,"01:39:12,533","01:39:13,784",How will you find us?
1334,"01:39:14,368","01:39:15,577",I know how.
1335,"01:40:33,363","01:40:34,698",Diana!
1336,"01:40:37,826","01:40:40,495",They're dead. They're all dead.
1337,"01:40:41,330","01:40:42,956",I could have saved them.
1338,"01:40:43,290","01:40:45,667","I could have saved them
if it weren't for you."
1339,"01:40:45,834","01:40:47,794",You stopped me from killing Ares!
1340,"01:40:48,337","01:40:50,464","- No!
- Stay away from me!"
1341,"01:40:50,631","01:40:51,965",I understand everything now.
1342,"01:40:52,132","01:40:53,967","It isn't just the Germans
that Ares has corrupted."
1343,"01:40:54,134","01:40:55,302","It's you, too."
1344,"01:40:55,928","01:40:57,054",All of you.
1345,"01:40:58,180","01:40:59,556",I will find Ares
1346,"01:40:59,723","01:41:01,350",and I will kill him.
1347,"01:41:04,478","01:41:05,479",Diana!
1348,"01:41:06,772","01:41:08,023","That smoke,"
1349,"01:41:09,024","01:41:10,150",it's the Chief!
1350,"01:41:10,317","01:41:11,568",He followed Ludendorff.
1351,"01:41:13,070","01:41:14,655",Follow the smoke!
1352,"01:41:40,806","01:41:42,349","Hey! Diana, that way!"
1353,"01:41:58,740","01:42:00,617",Come on! Let's go!
1354,"01:42:22,180","01:42:23,765",What a surprise.
1355,"01:42:24,474","01:42:25,684",Strange.
1356,"01:42:26,977","01:42:29,146","Unfortunately, I have another matter"
1357,"01:42:30,439","01:42:31,440",to attend to.
1358,"01:42:36,611","01:42:38,905",What are you?
1359,"01:42:39,072","01:42:40,324",You will soon find out.
1360,"01:43:14,733","01:43:18,445","As magnificent as you are,
you are still no match for me."
1361,"01:43:22,616","01:43:24,409",We'll see about that.
1362,"01:43:48,683","01:43:50,811","I am Diana of Themyscira,"
1363,"01:43:52,521","01:43:54,606","daughter of Hippolyta,"
1364,"01:43:55,482","01:43:57,818",Queen of the Amazons.
1365,"01:44:01,071","01:44:03,824",And your wrath upon this world is over.
1366,"01:44:20,632","01:44:23,385","In the name of all
that is good in this world,"
1367,"01:44:23,552","01:44:26,263","I hereby complete
the mission of the Amazons"
1368,"01:44:26,430","01:44:28,265",by ridding this world of you
1369,"01:44:28,432","01:44:29,516",forever!
1370,"01:45:36,750","01:45:37,751",Diana?
1371,"01:45:43,840","01:45:45,091",Diana!
1372,"01:45:49,262","01:45:50,514",I killed him.
1373,"01:45:52,098","01:45:54,267","I killed him, but nothing stopped."
1374,"01:45:56,436","01:45:58,647","You kill the God of War,
you stop the war."
1375,"01:45:58,813","01:46:00,899",Exactly what we have to do now.
1376,"01:46:01,066","01:46:02,484",We need to stop the gas. Come on.
1377,"01:46:02,651","01:46:03,944",No. All of this should have stopped!
1378,"01:46:04,110","01:46:05,111",Diana...
1379,"01:46:05,278","01:46:07,113","The fighting should have stopped.
Why are they doing this?"
1380,"01:46:07,280","01:46:09,282",I don't know! I don't know.
1381,"01:46:09,449","01:46:11,117",Ares is dead.
1382,"01:46:11,284","01:46:13,495","They can stop fighting now.
Why are they still fighting?"
1383,"01:46:13,662","01:46:15,288","Because, maybe it's them!"
1384,"01:46:15,830","01:46:16,831",Maybe...
1385,"01:46:18,792","01:46:21,419",Maybe people aren't always good.
1386,"01:46:22,295","01:46:24,172","Ares or no Ares,"
1387,"01:46:25,465","01:46:28,843",maybe it's just who they are.
1388,"01:46:31,680","01:46:33,056","- Diana...
- No."
1389,"01:46:33,223","01:46:34,724","Diana, we can talk about this later."
1390,"01:46:34,891","01:46:35,976","- I need you to come with me.
- No. No."
1391,"01:46:36,142","01:46:38,061","After everything I saw, it can't be!"
1392,"01:46:38,228","01:46:39,688",It cannot be!
1393,"01:46:40,313","01:46:42,065",They were killing each other.
1394,"01:46:42,232","01:46:44,985","Killing people they cannot see.
Children..."
1395,"01:46:45,151","01:46:46,695",Children!
1396,"01:46:46,903","01:46:49,322","No, it had to be him.
It cannot be them!"
1397,"01:46:49,489","01:46:51,908","Diana, people... I..."
1398,"01:46:52,075","01:46:53,577",She was right.
1399,"01:46:54,160","01:46:55,161",My mother was right.
1400,"01:46:55,328","01:46:57,247","She said,
""The world of men do not deserve you."""
1401,"01:46:57,414","01:46:59,291","They don't deserve our help, Steve."
1402,"01:46:59,457","01:47:01,585","- It's not about deserve!
- They don't deserve our help."
1403,"01:47:01,751","01:47:03,587",Maybe we don't!
1404,"01:47:05,213","01:47:07,465","But it's not about that.
It's about what you believe."
1405,"01:47:08,508","01:47:11,344","You don't think I get it
after what I've seen out there?"
1406,"01:47:13,513","01:47:16,182","You don't think I wish I could tell you
that it was one bad guy to blame?"
1407,"01:47:17,058","01:47:18,560",It's not!
1408,"01:47:20,937","01:47:22,564",We're all to blame.
1409,"01:47:22,856","01:47:23,857",I am not.
1410,"01:47:25,400","01:47:27,193",But maybe I am!
1411,"01:47:31,156","01:47:32,240",Please.
1412,"01:47:32,407","01:47:34,200","If you believe that this war should stop,"
1413,"01:47:34,367","01:47:36,119","if you want to stop it,"
1414,"01:47:36,286","01:47:38,538",help me stop it right now.
1415,"01:47:40,248","01:47:43,084","Because, if you don't,
they will kill thousands more."
1416,"01:47:43,710","01:47:45,670","Please, please come with me."
1417,"01:47:45,837","01:47:47,380",I have to go.
1418,"01:47:52,927","01:47:55,388",I have to go.
1419,"01:48:07,233","01:48:08,234",Hey! Hey!
1420,"01:48:12,739","01:48:14,157","- Where's Diana?
- We're on our own."
1421,"01:48:14,324","01:48:16,785","- What?
- What do you see, Charlie?"
1422,"01:48:17,494","01:48:19,120",Looks like a bunch of gas bombs
1423,"01:48:19,287","01:48:21,915",but I can't see where they're taking them.
1424,"01:48:22,082","01:48:23,416",How are we going to get in there?
1425,"01:48:24,084","01:48:26,127","I've got an idea. Come on, guys."
1426,"01:48:26,294","01:48:27,420",Come on!
1427,"01:48:41,267","01:48:42,811",Who's there?
1428,"01:48:55,490","01:48:57,033",Sir Patrick.
1429,"01:48:57,784","01:49:02,122","You were right, Diana.
They don't deserve our help."
1430,"01:49:03,289","01:49:07,252",They only deserve destruction.
1431,"01:49:08,294","01:49:09,713",You...
1432,"01:49:11,631","01:49:13,633",You're him.
1433,"01:49:17,053","01:49:18,471",I am.
1434,"01:49:19,055","01:49:23,977",But I am not what you thought I was.
1435,"01:49:44,122","01:49:45,707",What is it?
1436,"01:49:47,000","01:49:48,418",The future.
1437,"01:49:53,006","01:49:55,175","I am not your enemy, Diana."
1438,"01:49:57,010","01:50:00,847",I am the only one who truly knows you.
1439,"01:50:01,014","01:50:05,435","And who truly knows them, as you now do."
1440,"01:50:07,854","01:50:11,691","They have always been,
and always will be"
1441,"01:50:11,858","01:50:15,695","weak, cruel, selfish,"
1442,"01:50:15,862","01:50:19,032",and capable of the greatest horrors.
1443,"01:50:28,374","01:50:29,876",All I ever wanted
1444,"01:50:30,043","01:50:35,006","was for the Gods to see how evil
my father's creation was."
1445,"01:50:36,925","01:50:38,635",But they refused.
1446,"01:50:38,802","01:50:40,053",I am Diana of Themyscira...
1447,"01:50:40,220","01:50:41,221",So I destroyed them.
1448,"01:50:41,387","01:50:43,389","...daughter of Hippolyta,"
1449,"01:50:43,556","01:50:44,682",and I'm here to complete her--
1450,"01:50:53,566","01:50:54,818",The Godkiller...
1451,"01:50:57,862","01:50:59,781","My dear child,"
1452,"01:51:01,157","01:51:03,660",that is not the Godkiller.
1453,"01:51:06,162","01:51:07,705",You are.
1454,"01:51:10,416","01:51:13,419",Only a god can kill another god.
1455,"01:51:14,420","01:51:18,341","Zeus left the child he had
with the Queen of the Amazons"
1456,"01:51:18,508","01:51:20,593",as a weapon to use against me.
1457,"01:51:20,760","01:51:22,595",No. You liar.
1458,"01:51:24,305","01:51:26,766",I compel you to tell me the truth.
1459,"01:51:29,102","01:51:30,812",I am.
1460,"01:51:56,963","01:51:59,340","I am not the God of War, Diana."
1461,"01:51:59,507","01:52:02,218",I am the God of Truth.
1462,"01:52:03,511","01:52:05,013",Mankind
1463,"01:52:05,638","01:52:07,807",stole this world from us.
1464,"01:52:10,476","01:52:14,022","They ruined it, day by day."
1465,"01:52:14,188","01:52:18,359","And I, the only one
wise enough to see it,"
1466,"01:52:20,028","01:52:22,780",was left too weak to stop them.
1467,"01:52:23,489","01:52:27,118","All these years,
I have struggled alone,"
1468,"01:52:27,285","01:52:29,203",whispering into their ears.
1469,"01:52:29,370","01:52:34,208","Ideas, inspiration for formulas,"
1470,"01:52:35,001","01:52:36,628","weapons,"
1471,"01:52:39,130","01:52:41,633",but I don't make them use them.
1472,"01:52:42,508","01:52:44,594",They start these wars on their own.
1473,"01:52:45,720","01:52:49,515","All I do is orchestrate an armistice
I know they cannot keep,"
1474,"01:52:49,682","01:52:52,226",in the hope they will destroy themselves.
1475,"01:52:53,978","01:52:56,022",But it has never been enough.
1476,"01:52:57,690","01:52:59,442",Until you.
1477,"01:53:01,486","01:53:05,740","When you first arrived,
I was going to crush you."
1478,"01:53:06,240","01:53:09,494",But I knew that if only you could see
1479,"01:53:09,661","01:53:12,497","what the other gods could not,"
1480,"01:53:14,874","01:53:19,420","then you would join me,
and with our powers combined,"
1481,"01:53:19,587","01:53:23,591","we could finally end all the pain,
all the suffering,"
1482,"01:53:23,758","01:53:26,469",the destruction they bring.
1483,"01:53:26,636","01:53:31,933","And we could return this world
to the paradise it was before them."
1484,"01:53:33,393","01:53:35,019",Forever.
1485,"01:53:37,897","01:53:39,440",I...
1486,"01:53:44,112","01:53:46,990",I could never be a part of that.
1487,"01:53:50,243","01:53:52,870","My dear, I don't want to fight you."
1488,"01:53:53,955","01:53:55,331","But, if I must..."
1489,"01:54:04,799","01:54:06,592","- Steve!
- Come on, let's go!"
1490,"01:54:07,301","01:54:08,428","Sammy, let's go!"
1491,"01:54:09,053","01:54:10,722",Get this plane out of here!
1492,"01:54:40,668","01:54:45,089","Oh, my dear, you have so much to learn."
1493,"01:55:10,198","01:55:12,533","Oh, my God!"
1494,"01:55:12,700","01:55:13,993",What are we gonna do?
1495,"01:55:15,828","01:55:18,039","There's not much we can do,"
1496,"01:55:18,498","01:55:19,999",if that's who I think it is.
1497,"01:55:26,005","01:55:27,924",But we can stop that plane.
1498,"01:55:40,978","01:55:43,022","If we can get on the radio,"
1499,"01:55:43,189","01:55:45,066",we can ask Flying Corps to shoot her down.
1500,"01:55:45,233","01:55:48,361","No. If it crashes, it'll wipe everyone out
for 50 square miles!"
1501,"01:55:48,528","01:55:49,529",We gotta ground it!
1502,"01:55:49,695","01:55:51,531",Bad news. It's on a timer.
1503,"01:55:51,697","01:55:54,075","If we ground it here,
it's the same thing."
1504,"01:56:01,040","01:56:02,834","Is it flammable, Chief?"
1505,"01:56:03,000","01:56:06,379","Yeah, she said it's hydrogen.
It's flammable."
1506,"01:56:13,427","01:56:15,721","I need you guys to clear me a path
to that plane."
1507,"01:56:15,888","01:56:18,099","- No, Steve!
- Hey, Steve!"
1508,"01:56:19,392","01:56:20,393",Come on!
1509,"01:57:03,769","01:57:05,563",Come on! This way! Steve!
1510,"01:57:15,948","01:57:17,158","- Go, Steve, come on.
- Go!"
1511,"01:57:17,950","01:57:19,327",Steve!
1512,"01:57:22,163","01:57:24,123","- Go, Steve. Come on.
- Run, run!"
1513,"01:58:02,245","01:58:05,665",Let's see what kind of god you really are.
1514,"01:58:31,857","01:58:34,527","You will help me destroy them, Diana,"
1515,"01:58:38,656","01:58:40,533",or you will die.
1516,"01:58:50,501","01:58:52,753","Come on, come on.
Let's go, go, go!"
1517,"01:58:54,797","01:58:57,049","- Move it, boys! Now!
- Let's go! Run!"
1518,"01:59:22,908","01:59:25,619",Is that all you have to offer?
1519,"01:59:41,844","01:59:45,765",It is futile to imagine you can win.
1520,"01:59:46,557","01:59:48,184","Give up, Diana."
1521,"01:59:48,351","01:59:49,352","Guys, I'm out."
1522,"01:59:52,355","01:59:53,606",Chief! Anything left?
1523,"01:59:53,773","01:59:54,857",I got nothing.
1524,"01:59:55,024","01:59:56,067","- Anything!
- No."
1525,"02:00:14,001","02:00:15,169",Steve.
1526,"02:01:01,549","02:01:02,967",Steve...
1527,"02:01:06,470","02:01:08,848",No!
1528,"02:01:43,799","02:01:46,093","Yes, Diana!"
1529,"02:01:46,260","02:01:48,971",Take them all!
1530,"02:01:49,138","02:01:52,099","Finally, you see."
1531,"02:01:52,725","02:01:55,144",Look at this world.
1532,"02:01:56,061","02:01:58,856","Mankind did this, not me."
1533,"02:02:00,065","02:02:01,984","They are ugly,"
1534,"02:02:02,151","02:02:04,236","filled with hatred,"
1535,"02:02:04,403","02:02:05,654","weak,"
1536,"02:02:05,821","02:02:08,908",just like your Captain Trevor.
1537,"02:02:09,074","02:02:11,911","Gone, and left you nothing."
1538,"02:02:12,745","02:02:14,914",And for what?
1539,"02:02:15,331","02:02:16,624",Pathetic!
1540,"02:02:18,459","02:02:19,752",He deserved to burn!
1541,"02:02:30,763","02:02:34,475",Look at her and tell me I'm wrong.
1542,"02:02:43,609","02:02:47,613",She is the perfect example of these humans
1543,"02:02:49,406","02:02:53,202",and unworthy of your sympathy in every way.
1544,"02:02:54,453","02:02:56,956","Destroy her, Diana."
1545,"02:02:57,623","02:03:01,043","You know that she deserves it.
They all do."
1546,"02:03:04,630","02:03:06,090",Do it!
1547,"02:03:10,803","02:03:12,471",Diana!
1548,"02:03:15,849","02:03:17,268",Diana...
1549,"02:03:26,026","02:03:27,027",What?
1550,"02:03:28,153","02:03:29,822",I have to go.
1551,"02:03:32,533","02:03:33,993",What are you saying?
1552,"02:03:34,368","02:03:35,369","Steve,"
1553,"02:03:36,036","02:03:38,330","whatever it is, I can do it."
1554,"02:03:38,497","02:03:39,498",No. No.
1555,"02:03:39,665","02:03:41,292","- Let me do it.
- No."
1556,"02:03:41,458","02:03:43,002",It has to be me.
1557,"02:03:43,168","02:03:44,962",It has to be me.
1558,"02:03:45,129","02:03:48,132","I can save today.
You could save the world."
1559,"02:03:56,974","02:03:59,602",I wish we had more time.
1560,"02:04:00,185","02:04:02,688",What? What are you saying?
1561,"02:04:05,357","02:04:06,525",I love you!
1562,"02:04:18,537","02:04:19,830",You're wrong about them.
1563,"02:04:29,757","02:04:31,508","They're everything you say,"
1564,"02:04:32,259","02:04:34,011",but so much more.
1565,"02:04:34,178","02:04:35,554",Lies!
1566,"02:05:01,789","02:05:05,417",They do not deserve your protection!
1567,"02:05:07,211","02:05:08,379",It's not about deserve.
1568,"02:05:13,258","02:05:15,177",It's about what you believe.
1569,"02:05:18,430","02:05:19,932",And I believe in love.
1570,"02:05:20,099","02:05:24,395",Then I will destroy you!
1571,"02:05:52,297","02:05:53,966","Goodbye, brother."
1572,"02:09:26,219","02:09:28,555",I used to want to save the world.
1573,"02:09:29,723","02:09:33,477",To end war and bring peace to mankind.
1574,"02:09:34,061","02:09:37,898","But then I glimpsed the darkness
that lives within their light"
1575,"02:09:38,815","02:09:41,151","and learned that inside every one of them,"
1576,"02:09:41,735","02:09:43,987",there will always be both.
1577,"02:09:44,863","02:09:47,741",A choice each must make for themselves.
1578,"02:09:47,908","02:09:51,328",Something no hero will ever defeat.
1579,"02:09:53,038","02:09:54,039",And now I know
1580,"02:09:54,998","02:09:59,628",that only love can truly save the world.
1581,"02:10:01,505","02:10:03,173","So, I stay,"
1582,"02:10:03,340","02:10:05,509","I fight, and I give,"
1583,"02:10:08,261","02:10:10,263",for the world I know can be.
1584,"02:10:15,018","02:10:16,228",This is my mission now.
1585,"02:10:19,606","02:10:20,941",Forever.
