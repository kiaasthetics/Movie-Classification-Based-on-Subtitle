2,"00:00:39,997","00:00:42,368","This is me. Yeah, really."
3,"00:00:43,634","00:00:46,001",I was so little.
4,"00:00:46,003","00:00:48,037","We were all little once, right?"
5,"00:01:00,384","00:01:03,856",This tiny apartment is my home.
6,"00:01:05,423","00:01:08,060","When I was little,
I never went out."
7,"00:01:10,095","00:01:13,363","So, naturally,
I was curious about the world."
8,"00:01:13,365","00:01:16,035",Very curious.
9,"00:01:21,972","00:01:26,809","Boss, there's still no sign
of a cat or a necklace."
10,"00:01:38,122","00:01:42,660","He told me that out there
was this great place."
11,"00:03:12,384","00:03:14,520",Oh!
12,"00:03:16,788","00:03:18,687",Where did you go?
13,"00:03:18,689","00:03:22,026",What happened to you? Blanket...
14,"00:03:35,206","00:03:38,944","After that,
I never left home again."
15,"00:04:02,232","00:04:05,567","- Daddy.
- Hmm?"
16,"00:04:05,569","00:04:08,204",Daddy!
17,"00:04:08,206","00:04:10,875","- Daddy!
- Argh!"
18,"00:04:28,359","00:04:30,258",Hah!
19,"00:04:43,541","00:04:45,476",Huh?
20,"00:04:58,890","00:05:02,724","Daddy, the city -
what's it like?"
21,"00:05:06,029","00:05:10,665","Cape, I've told you
many, many, many times about it."
22,"00:05:10,667","00:05:12,400","Out there, it's chaotic,"
23,"00:05:12,402","00:05:15,671","it's cold
and also full of crooks."
24,"00:05:15,673","00:05:18,174","It's not exactly
what you think it is."
25,"00:05:18,176","00:05:21,611","But I want to go!
I've never been outside."
26,"00:05:21,613","00:05:25,681","When you grow up,
my son, you will understand."
27,"00:05:25,683","00:05:28,184",This is such a nice home.
28,"00:05:28,186","00:05:30,585","We lack only the things
we don't need."
29,"00:05:30,587","00:05:33,124","You should be content,
just like I am."
30,"00:05:35,193","00:05:37,128",I don't want to be like you.
31,"00:05:38,296","00:05:41,463","- Huh?
- Blanket! Cape!"
32,"00:05:41,465","00:05:43,332","Look, meet your new pal!"
33,"00:05:50,541","00:05:52,344",Come down here! Oh!
34,"00:06:04,388","00:06:06,222",She's a blue-and-gold macaw.
35,"00:06:06,224","00:06:08,327","Her perch
is still downstairs."
36,"00:06:10,460","00:06:14,162","- Hi. What's your name?
- Macaw."
37,"00:06:14,164","00:06:17,333","Yes, I know you're a macaw,
but what's your name?"
38,"00:06:17,335","00:06:20,302","- I'm Mack.
- Mack, here's your perch. Come."
39,"00:06:20,304","00:06:23,071",Whoa.
40,"00:06:23,073","00:06:25,340",Uh?
41,"00:06:25,342","00:06:27,612","I have your seeds
and nuts."
42,"00:06:28,779","00:06:31,080",You're really named Mack?
43,"00:06:31,082","00:06:33,982","- Yeah.
- Huh? But you're a female."
44,"00:06:33,984","00:06:36,751","Why is your name Mack?
It's such a macho name."
45,"00:06:36,753","00:06:39,655","What can I do about it?
This is my sixth home already."
46,"00:06:39,657","00:06:42,592","New home, new name. Who can
possibly keep track of it all?"
47,"00:06:44,495","00:06:47,530","In the end, I suppose that Mack
was just easier for everyone."
48,"00:06:47,532","00:06:49,332",Have you been to lots of places?
49,"00:06:49,334","00:06:52,133","Of course, little buddy.
Of course."
50,"00:06:52,135","00:06:54,970","Although, I have
a small character flaw."
51,"00:06:54,972","00:06:58,941",I can't resist... biting things.
52,"00:06:58,943","00:07:00,710",I'm a tad destructive.
53,"00:07:00,712","00:07:02,510","It's a tiny character flaw,"
54,"00:07:02,512","00:07:04,713","but humans can't seem
to cope with it."
55,"00:07:04,715","00:07:06,816",You've been in so many homes.
56,"00:07:06,818","00:07:09,520","- So, you've been outside too?
- Huh?"
57,"00:07:13,157","00:07:16,758","- Why are you so interested?
- Being home all day is boring."
58,"00:07:16,760","00:07:18,794",I see.
59,"00:07:18,796","00:07:23,131",Water! Water! Aah! Ah-ha-ha!
60,"00:07:23,133","00:07:25,100","If you're so scared of soda,"
61,"00:07:25,102","00:07:27,770","I bet bath time must leave you
a total wreck, doesn't it?"
62,"00:07:27,772","00:07:30,108",You...
63,"00:07:32,277","00:07:34,443","Hey, Fatty. Hey, Fatty!"
64,"00:07:34,445","00:07:36,778","It's rude to keep your door open
while on the toilet"
65,"00:07:36,780","00:07:39,248","with a lady around, understand?"
66,"00:07:39,250","00:07:41,650","- Ugh!
- Aunty Mack?"
67,"00:07:41,652","00:07:45,621","Outside? I don't know.
I haven't been."
68,"00:07:45,623","00:07:47,356","- Well, I have.
- You?"
69,"00:07:47,358","00:07:49,924",A fat and lazy cat?
70,"00:07:49,926","00:07:54,030","A fat cat who can barely
fit on the toilet. You?"
71,"00:07:54,032","00:07:56,665","So, what's out there?
Tell us."
72,"00:07:56,667","00:07:59,602",Tell us. Come on. Tell us!
73,"00:07:59,604","00:08:01,304","- Peachtopia.
- Huh?"
74,"00:08:01,306","00:08:03,205",Peachtopia?
75,"00:08:03,207","00:08:06,142","A peach tree forest
along the stream."
76,"00:08:06,144","00:08:09,044",That's right. Hmm!
77,"00:08:09,046","00:08:12,114","I've been told by many cats
about that legendary place."
78,"00:08:12,116","00:08:15,551","A real Peachtopia.
It's a place for cats."
79,"00:08:15,553","00:08:17,787",You don't know about it?
80,"00:08:17,789","00:08:19,587","Five, six, seven, eight."

your mind, Blanket?"

when you were little,"
104,"00:10:46,002","00:10:48,839",a stray cat came around here.
105,"00:10:51,675","00:10:53,978","Dad, he was
from Peachtopia, right?"
106,"00:10:57,582","00:11:00,316","Daddy, where did Mommy go?"
107,"00:11:00,318","00:11:04,420",Could she be... in Peachtopia?
108,"00:11:04,422","00:11:10,392","Maybe she's waiting over there
by a peach tree."
109,"00:11:10,394","00:11:12,998","Daddy, I want to go out."
110,"00:11:29,713","00:11:32,784","Hey, what are you doing?"
111,"00:11:35,986","00:11:38,789",Huh?
112,"00:11:50,668","00:11:52,404",Hmm.
113,"00:12:05,415","00:12:07,585",Huh?
114,"00:12:30,274","00:12:32,206","- Phew!
- You scared me! You scared me!"
115,"00:12:32,208","00:12:35,543","- That was so reckless.
- Cape, cats aren't birds."
116,"00:12:35,545","00:12:38,113","Cats can't fly.
Your mother, she..."
117,"00:12:38,115","00:12:40,784","Well, she, uh..."
118,"00:12:43,154","00:12:46,055",What about my mom? Where is she?
119,"00:12:46,057","00:12:50,526","Your mom,
she... went to Peachtopia."
120,"00:12:50,528","00:12:53,195","Really?
My mom went to Peachtopia?!"
121,"00:12:53,197","00:12:55,133","Hey, let's go find her!"
122,"00:12:57,901","00:13:02,171","It's too far away.
We'll never make it."
123,"00:13:02,173","00:13:05,376",Why is that?
124,"00:13:07,211","00:13:11,479","Cape, cats aren't birds.
Cats can't fly."
125,"00:13:11,481","00:13:13,983",Fly?
126,"00:13:13,985","00:13:15,917",Huh?
127,"00:13:27,765","00:13:30,869",Ah!

130,"00:13:46,650","00:13:48,883",Oh!
131,"00:13:48,885","00:13:52,354","Hey, Cape, let's say
you do make it down."
132,"00:13:52,356","00:13:54,058","There's still the river
to cross."
133,"00:13:56,894","00:14:00,561","..everywhere and
in your home, in your cosy home,"
134,"00:14:00,563","00:14:04,199","and in your cosy kitchen,
there's danger!"
135,"00:14:04,201","00:14:06,567","- Take this...
- Ow! Ow! Ow!"
136,"00:14:06,569","00:14:09,838","My goodness! Oh!
That's so scary! So shocking!"
137,"00:14:09,840","00:14:13,474","A lifetime of scares under our
own roof! It's unbelievable!"
138,"00:14:13,476","00:14:16,612","You see? You see? It's even
dangerous at home, you guys."
139,"00:14:16,614","00:14:18,647","Come on. Come on.
Give me a warship!"
140,"00:14:38,269","00:14:39,971",Uh...
141,"00:14:51,448","00:14:54,282","Cape, to be young
is to struggle,"
142,"00:14:54,284","00:14:55,950",but there's no point.
143,"00:14:57,788","00:15:00,659","Hey, Cape?"
144,"00:15:02,525","00:15:04,292",What are you doing?
145,"00:15:04,294","00:15:06,394","Daddy, look, I made a rocket!"
146,"00:15:06,396","00:15:09,364",I'm going to fly it out of here.
147,"00:15:11,836","00:15:14,202",Huh?
148,"00:15:14,204","00:15:17,940","Cape, get down! Aargh!"
149,"00:15:17,942","00:15:21,944","Daddy, I'm going to Peachtopia!
Look! Watch me fly!"
150,"00:15:25,949","00:15:29,020",Cape! Cape!
151,"00:15:37,127","00:15:39,595","- Aah!
- He's really flying!"
152,"00:15:55,779","00:15:59,013",Aah! Cape! He's falling!
153,"00:16:06,122","00:16:08,459",Yeah!
154,"00:16:28,611","00:16:30,778",Aah!
155,"00:16:42,193","00:16:44,292",We have to save him!
156,"00:16:49,098","00:16:51,502",Oh! Oh! Oh!
157,"00:17:20,397","00:17:22,600",Cape!
158,"00:17:29,340","00:17:31,109",Hey!
159,"00:17:37,247","00:17:40,081",Huh?
160,"00:17:48,191","00:17:50,260",Cape!
161,"00:17:59,370","00:18:02,640","The red speck, I can't see it.
Oh, Cape."
162,"00:18:11,047","00:18:14,882",Huh?
163,"00:18:14,884","00:18:16,551","- What's that?
- Looks like a cat."
164,"00:18:16,553","00:18:18,153","- Really?
- There's a cat on it!"
165,"00:18:18,155","00:18:20,091",Oh!
166,"00:18:44,848","00:18:46,584",Ah!
167,"00:18:48,518","00:18:50,287",Ah!
168,"00:18:57,628","00:19:00,128",Whoa.
169,"00:19:03,667","00:19:06,971",Yeah! Oh!
170,"00:19:17,046","00:19:18,783",Huh?
171,"00:19:27,957","00:19:29,791","Daddy, Daddy! Look!"
172,"00:19:29,793","00:19:31,626","I just photographed
a paraglider."
173,"00:19:31,628","00:19:33,494","- Uh-huh. I see.
- Come on."
174,"00:19:33,496","00:19:35,763","- Look again.
- Sure, sure."
175,"00:19:35,765","00:19:38,433","It flew and flew, flew
and flew, all the way to here."
176,"00:19:38,435","00:19:40,635",Oh. Great photo.
177,"00:19:40,637","00:19:42,771",She... she saw where Cape landed!
178,"00:19:42,773","00:19:45,310",Hurry up! Quick!
179,"00:19:49,412","00:19:51,946","You can do it, Fatty!"
180,"00:19:51,948","00:19:54,282","You having a baby or what, huh?
Just do it!"
181,"00:19:54,284","00:19:56,283",Come on!
182,"00:19:56,285","00:19:58,422",Push!
183,"00:19:59,656","00:20:02,957","That's it! Good.
Head's out! Whoa!"
184,"00:20:02,959","00:20:04,928",Hurry. Go on.
185,"00:20:47,236","00:20:49,006",Oh!

187,"00:21:07,190","00:21:09,925",Excuse me?
188,"00:21:09,927","00:21:11,661",Shh!
189,"00:21:21,772","00:21:23,972","Who are you?
How did you get here?"
190,"00:21:23,974","00:21:26,340","Well, actually,
I want to go there,"
191,"00:21:26,342","00:21:29,343","to the mountain there,
to Peachtopia."
192,"00:21:29,345","00:21:32,280",Peachtopia? Never heard of it.
193,"00:21:32,282","00:21:35,520","But it's dangerous here.
Easy to get in, hard to get out."
194,"00:21:40,791","00:21:42,493",Huh?
195,"00:21:46,196","00:21:49,697","He got in by accident.
Let him go."
196,"00:21:49,699","00:21:51,699","Run, little cat!"
197,"00:21:57,740","00:22:00,175",No!
198,"00:22:00,177","00:22:03,177",No! No!
199,"00:22:10,720","00:22:14,022","- These are his early works.
- Yeah, we love those."
200,"00:22:14,024","00:22:16,323","My wife and I collect them.
Do you have any new ones?"
201,"00:22:16,325","00:22:18,129",Huh?
202,"00:22:21,698","00:22:23,434",Aah!
203,"00:22:28,138","00:22:30,608",Hey! Whoa!
204,"00:22:33,043","00:22:34,809",Stop!
205,"00:22:42,319","00:22:44,688",Ow!
206,"00:22:54,363","00:22:56,564","Yes, the new ones."
207,"00:22:56,566","00:22:59,301","Yeah, they didn't
really have them."
208,"00:22:59,303","00:23:01,669",No.
209,"00:23:04,006","00:23:06,843",Get down! Now!
210,"00:23:15,919","00:23:17,688",Huh?
211,"00:23:19,488","00:23:21,822","No, he's stuck."
212,"00:23:21,824","00:23:24,158","Round and round he goes,"
213,"00:23:24,160","00:23:26,026","but then no, nothing."
214,"00:23:26,028","00:23:28,096","- Look.
- Too complicated."
215,"00:23:28,098","00:23:30,698","No, no, that's it!"
216,"00:23:30,700","00:23:33,368","- It's way too complicated.
- Huh?"
217,"00:23:33,370","00:23:37,171","He's searching
for a breakthrough."
218,"00:23:37,173","00:23:40,007","Artists struggle, get stuck,"
219,"00:23:40,009","00:23:42,843","and then bang, they amaze us."
220,"00:23:42,845","00:23:44,713","Sure, if there's a bang."
221,"00:23:44,715","00:23:46,449",Huh?
222,"00:23:54,624","00:23:56,993",Huh?
223,"00:24:27,524","00:24:29,126","- Search over here.
- Huh?"
224,"00:24:39,703","00:24:41,535",Huh?
225,"00:24:41,537","00:24:43,207",Hey.
226,"00:24:44,675","00:24:46,611","- Hey.
- Huh?"
227,"00:24:49,111","00:24:51,980","- Huh?
- There's cameras everywhere."
228,"00:24:51,982","00:24:55,382",Follow my footsteps.
229,"00:25:12,335","00:25:15,171",Hmm!
230,"00:25:19,176","00:25:21,012","- Over there! Get him!
- Huh?"
231,"00:25:26,582","00:25:28,451","There!
Over there! Quick!"
232,"00:25:36,626","00:25:39,194","He, boss,
we checked the whole factory."
233,"00:25:39,196","00:25:41,529",And we locked up the ape.
234,"00:25:41,531","00:25:43,697","- Just go now.
- Sure."
235,"00:25:43,699","00:25:46,533","All my work, my inspiration,"
236,"00:25:46,535","00:25:49,870","even this workshop
began with that bead."
237,"00:25:49,872","00:25:52,639","And after all this time,
it's finally back!"
238,"00:25:55,144","00:26:00,314","Lately, sales have been
way, way down."
239,"00:26:00,316","00:26:04,551","That work,
even old customers dislike it."
240,"00:26:04,553","00:26:07,190","As you know,
the market prefers the early..."
241,"00:26:08,992","00:26:11,192",What's wrong with the new work?
242,"00:26:11,194","00:26:13,962","What's wrong with it?
What do they know, huh?"
243,"00:26:13,964","00:26:17,432","Maybe... maybe it's because
they're too complicated?"
244,"00:26:17,434","00:26:19,234",What's that even mean?
245,"00:26:19,236","00:26:21,069","What do you mean,
""too complicated""?"
246,"00:26:21,071","00:26:24,505","Which bit is too much?
Tell me! Which bit? Tell me!"
247,"00:26:24,507","00:26:27,742","You're the boss
and you create the work."
248,"00:26:27,744","00:26:30,244","I'm the manager,
I look after sales."
249,"00:26:30,246","00:26:34,081","The market's tough now.
Sales are really bad."
250,"00:26:34,083","00:26:36,687","If nothing changes,
this workshop..."
251,"00:26:42,124","00:26:44,961","We'll look all over the place
for that necklace."
252,"00:27:01,544","00:27:04,178","What now? How can we see
that photo? Huh?"
253,"00:27:04,180","00:27:07,215","Wow! Daddy, look!
The river's so wide!"
254,"00:27:07,217","00:27:09,016","- It's so pretty!
- Leave it to me."
255,"00:27:12,488","00:27:14,488",Let's see the paraglider photo.
256,"00:27:14,490","00:27:16,724",Paraglider? OK. There.
257,"00:27:16,726","00:27:18,396",Huh? A parrot?
258,"00:27:24,100","00:27:26,303",Whoa! Oh!
259,"00:27:27,736","00:27:29,573",Whoa!
260,"00:27:44,821","00:27:47,824",Whoa! Oh. Aah!
261,"00:27:56,832","00:27:58,966",Oh! Aah!
262,"00:27:58,968","00:28:01,336",Oh!
263,"00:28:01,338","00:28:04,108","Give it to me!
Open your stupid beak!"
264,"00:28:10,613","00:28:13,514",Huh?
265,"00:28:19,221","00:28:21,121",The photo!
266,"00:28:30,499","00:28:32,268",Huh?
267,"00:28:41,244","00:28:43,911","Don't worry, I saw it.
I know where Cape landed."
268,"00:28:43,913","00:28:46,613","What? That's great.
You're the best!"
269,"00:29:27,990","00:29:30,126",Wow!

- It's Cape."
282,"00:30:11,368","00:30:13,767",You're a little house cat.
283,"00:30:13,769","00:30:15,672","How did a little house cat
land here?"
284,"00:30:17,774","00:30:21,009","In this place
of which there's no exit?"
285,"00:30:21,011","00:30:22,877",I'm looking for Peachtopia.
286,"00:30:22,879","00:30:25,312",Peachtopia?
287,"00:30:25,314","00:30:27,881",Peachtopia. Feline Peachtopia!
288,"00:30:27,883","00:30:31,386","My daddy says that feline
Peachtopia is really beautiful,"
289,"00:30:31,388","00:30:33,888",so I made a rocket and...
290,"00:30:33,890","00:30:35,622",..flew here to find Peachtopia.
291,"00:30:35,624","00:30:37,524","- A rocket?
- Mm."
292,"00:30:37,526","00:30:41,497","My daddy says that Peachtopia
is right here on this mountain."
293,"00:30:45,034","00:30:47,334","Why are you looking
for Peachtopia?"
294,"00:30:47,336","00:30:50,540","To find my mother.
My mother left us."
295,"00:30:51,841","00:30:54,542","I really don't want to be lazy
like my daddy is,"
296,"00:30:54,544","00:30:56,744","eating and sleeping
the entire day,"
297,"00:30:56,746","00:30:58,415",just staring out the window.
298,"00:31:00,382","00:31:03,386","My dad says
this'll take me to Peachtopia."
299,"00:31:04,486","00:31:06,387",Hmm...
300,"00:31:06,389","00:31:08,592","- Huh?
- The raccoons are here."
301,"00:31:15,331","00:31:18,267","- Begin searching.
- Right!"
302,"00:31:33,816","00:31:35,718",Huh...
303,"00:31:42,992","00:31:44,895",Ah...
304,"00:31:51,900","00:31:53,704",Hmm.
305,"00:32:25,101","00:32:27,036",Ah.
306,"00:32:32,141","00:32:33,876",Oh.
307,"00:32:42,351","00:32:44,519",The paw prints you cats make
308,"00:32:44,521","00:32:47,957","are certainly much prettier
than those of us raccoons."
309,"00:32:50,159","00:32:52,126",I'm off.
310,"00:32:52,128","00:32:54,564","If there's any news,
get in touch."
311,"00:33:13,182","00:33:14,917",Huh?
312,"00:33:18,621","00:33:20,424","Wake up, wake up."
313,"00:33:21,690","00:33:23,590","- Fatty, get up.
- Huh?"
314,"00:33:23,592","00:33:26,593","We were rescued by geese.
How cool is that?"
315,"00:33:26,595","00:33:29,664","We're in the belly
of a huge boat."
316,"00:33:29,666","00:33:33,266","This is our home. The boat
stops at a new dock every day."
317,"00:33:33,268","00:33:36,469","We're nearly at the dock
of the mountain right now."
318,"00:33:36,471","00:33:38,973","- Thank you so much!
- Animals should help animals."
319,"00:33:38,975","00:33:40,611",Oh!
320,"00:33:44,813","00:33:47,380","The boat docks
someplace new every day."
321,"00:33:47,382","00:33:49,282","You don't ever want
to settle down?"
322,"00:33:49,284","00:33:51,118",And what if...
323,"00:33:51,120","00:33:53,119","What if the crew
discover you all here?"
324,"00:33:53,121","00:33:55,956","If they do,
we'll just go elsewhere."
325,"00:33:55,958","00:34:00,194","Everywhere is so crowded.
We just occupy the corners."
326,"00:34:00,196","00:34:02,897","But we can't just hide,
never going out."
327,"00:34:02,899","00:34:04,965",We would suffocate!
328,"00:34:04,967","00:34:06,900","Every day,
we go someplace different,"
329,"00:34:06,902","00:34:10,370","so every day
we discover a new place."
330,"00:34:10,372","00:34:12,673",Aah!
331,"00:34:19,649","00:34:25,486","Hey, I'm coming too!"
332,"00:34:25,488","00:34:28,759",Huh?
333,"00:34:33,329","00:34:39,200",Huh?
334,"00:34:39,202","00:34:41,669","Daddy, come play with us,
please!"
335,"00:34:41,671","00:34:44,638",Sure! Here I come.
336,"00:34:48,610","00:34:52,146",Whoo!
337,"00:35:12,302","00:35:15,135",Thanks so much.
338,"00:35:15,137","00:35:17,907","If only my dad
was as tough as you."
339,"00:35:19,342","00:35:23,311","That Peachtopia,
does it really exist?"
340,"00:35:23,313","00:35:26,146","Is it really here
on the mountain?"
341,"00:35:26,148","00:35:28,783",It is.
342,"00:35:28,785","00:35:30,617",Really?
343,"00:35:30,619","00:35:32,787",It's at the bottom of the lake.
344,"00:35:32,789","00:35:36,823","Feline Peachtopia,"
345,"00:35:36,825","00:35:39,093",the valley of cats.
346,"00:35:39,095","00:35:43,263","There's a river
lined with peach trees."
347,"00:35:43,265","00:35:46,700","In winter, the river freezes."
348,"00:35:46,702","00:35:48,669",You can step on it easily
349,"00:35:48,671","00:35:51,939","and you can glide
really far distances -"
350,"00:35:51,941","00:35:56,209","so far you begin to wonder
what's beyond the valley,"
351,"00:35:56,211","00:35:59,483","what the world is like
beyond Peachtopia."
352,"00:36:00,950","00:36:04,354","You've been to Peachtopia?
You came from Peachtopia?"
353,"00:36:05,688","00:36:09,189","That necklace,
I gave it to your dad."
354,"00:36:09,191","00:36:13,160","You know my father?
You gave him this necklace?"
355,"00:36:13,162","00:36:16,430","He was just a kitten then,
just like you are now."
356,"00:36:16,432","00:36:18,332",That's so great!
357,"00:36:18,334","00:36:21,769","If my father knew I met you,
he'd be so happy!"
358,"00:36:21,771","00:36:24,905","Super! Peachtopia!
Let's go there together!"
359,"00:36:24,907","00:36:27,244",I can't go back to Peachtopia.
360,"00:36:28,311","00:36:30,276",But so what?
361,"00:36:30,278","00:36:33,082","Peachtopia is just a place,
a place like any other."
362,"00:36:35,318","00:36:38,352","It's that lake,
on the bottom."
363,"00:36:38,354","00:36:41,789","It's very deep with undertows.
Dangerous."
364,"00:36:41,791","00:36:43,657",I'm not scared!
365,"00:36:43,659","00:36:46,093","That doesn't mean
it's not dangerous."
366,"00:36:46,095","00:36:49,696","The cat your father knew
thought Peachtopia was small"
367,"00:36:49,698","00:36:51,966",and the world was big.
368,"00:36:51,968","00:36:56,836","That cat, now he's just
an old cat afraid to go home,"
369,"00:36:56,838","00:36:59,340","one of a pack of lonely strays,"
370,"00:36:59,342","00:37:01,278",passing the days in this dive.
371,"00:37:03,046","00:37:05,649","That necklace
will bring you bad luck."
372,"00:37:06,782","00:37:08,617",Throw it away.
373,"00:37:17,626","00:37:20,961","Listen, go up past the factory.
That's where your son landed."
374,"00:37:20,963","00:37:23,332","- Thank you. Come on, Mack.
- Mm."
375,"00:37:25,001","00:37:26,901","And when you find your son,"
376,"00:37:26,903","00:37:29,169","tell him we all think
he's really cool!"
377,"00:37:29,171","00:37:31,807","Super Rocket Cat!
Super cool!"
378,"00:37:38,747","00:37:44,151","I have toys. Stuffed toys.
Buy two, get one free. On sale."
379,"00:37:44,153","00:37:46,656",Aww.
380,"00:37:55,331","00:37:58,168","- Excuse me!
- Huh?"
381,"00:38:03,106","00:38:05,472","Yeah. Take it to the second shop
after the tunnel."
382,"00:38:05,474","00:38:07,343","Sure, got it."
383,"00:38:15,517","00:38:18,551",It's freezing.
384,"00:38:18,553","00:38:21,622","- Hang in there.
- I'm a tropical bird."

- What? Spit it out."
387,"00:38:36,005","00:38:38,008","- I need the toilet.
- Hold it in!"
388,"00:38:43,111","00:38:45,479","Oh, yeah."
389,"00:38:45,481","00:38:47,648","Oh, it's warm."

399,"00:39:45,775","00:39:49,142","I shouldn't have told Cape
his mom went to Peachtopia."
400,"00:39:49,144","00:39:54,080","Well, when we see him,
just tell him the truth."

we're going to that mountain,"

420,"00:41:15,731","00:41:19,867","- Can you tell us the way?
- You're lost."
421,"00:41:19,869","00:41:22,102",You're lost.
422,"00:41:22,104","00:41:24,704","- Peachtopia is on the mountain.
- Peachtopia?"
423,"00:41:24,706","00:41:29,376","What is Peachtopia?
It's a metaphor."
424,"00:41:29,378","00:41:32,012","Peachtopia exists
in our hearts."
425,"00:41:32,014","00:41:35,481",Only meditation leads us there.

advanced in the meditative arts."

Brother Antelope's Magic Pill?"
429,"00:41:47,563","00:41:51,133","Well, it has
its ups and downs. Not easy."
430,"00:41:52,702","00:41:54,901",Oh. Sister Goat is here too.

going for you, huh?"
433,"00:42:00,843","00:42:03,077","I've had
some minor breakthroughs,"
434,"00:42:03,079","00:42:06,213","but Brother Deer
is still our paragon."
435,"00:42:06,215","00:42:08,548",You flatter me.

and you don't already know,"
440,"00:42:18,994","00:42:21,695","I'll tell you about
the glass factory."
441,"00:42:21,697","00:42:23,830",It's very dangerous.
442,"00:42:23,832","00:42:27,934","It's full of nasty raccoons
who kidnap other animals."
443,"00:42:27,936","00:42:32,606","Yeah. Truth is, cities
and people are everywhere now."
444,"00:42:32,608","00:42:35,541","For us animals,
it's all dangerous."
445,"00:42:35,543","00:42:38,678","Only this cloth-dyeing plant
is peaceful,"
446,"00:42:38,680","00:42:40,948","so we live as hermits,"
447,"00:42:40,950","00:42:44,050","meditating,
pursuing enlightenment"

why don't you stay with us?"
451,"00:42:52,827","00:42:55,028",We happen to need two disciples.
452,"00:42:55,030","00:42:57,330","You can receive
our mystical secrets."
453,"00:42:57,332","00:42:58,899","True, true!"
454,"00:42:58,901","00:43:02,336",I can see your potential. I can.
455,"00:43:02,338","00:43:04,905","I appreciate your offer,
but I have to find my son."
456,"00:43:04,907","00:43:06,673","If where he went
is that dangerous,"
457,"00:43:06,675","00:43:08,642","it's even more important
that I find him."
458,"00:43:08,644","00:43:13,012","Oh, family keeps you
in the secular world."
459,"00:43:13,014","00:43:16,682","- What about the lady?
- I'm interested, I'm interested!"
460,"00:43:16,684","00:43:19,119","Oh, tell me your secrets."
461,"00:43:19,121","00:43:21,254","We'll find Cape
and then we'll come back."
462,"00:43:21,256","00:43:22,990",You are so powerful.
463,"00:43:22,992","00:43:26,095","You're so amazing! Teach me,
teach me, teach me now!"
464,"00:43:32,934","00:43:36,336","How dare you play
such dirty tricks!"
465,"00:43:36,338","00:43:39,539","- No respect! No respect!
- Catch them!"
466,"00:43:39,541","00:43:44,012","- Aah!
- There's no escape! Stop!"
467,"00:43:50,820","00:43:52,986","Look, the mountain!"
468,"00:43:59,561","00:44:01,562","- It's a trap!
- It's a trap!"
469,"00:44:01,564","00:44:03,564",Go up! Go up!
470,"00:44:08,369","00:44:10,072",Come on!
471,"00:44:20,515","00:44:22,284",Huh?
472,"00:44:23,586","00:44:25,419",Huh?
473,"00:45:17,639","00:45:20,173",It's so late. Why call us back?
474,"00:45:20,175","00:45:22,943","Well, the boss says
he's inspired"
475,"00:45:22,945","00:45:25,579",and to get ready.
476,"00:45:25,581","00:45:27,483","Hmm? Why is
the aerostatic press on?"
477,"00:45:45,300","00:45:48,003",Hey! Underwater currents!
478,"00:45:52,874","00:45:55,945","What is this hose
doing in the water?"
479,"00:46:04,019","00:46:06,890",Agh!
480,"00:46:38,621","00:46:40,456",Hmm.
481,"00:46:52,534","00:46:54,267","- Huh.
- Are they gone?"
482,"00:46:54,269","00:46:57,204",Shh! Looks like it.
483,"00:46:57,206","00:46:58,972",Those must be the raccoons.
484,"00:46:58,974","00:47:01,041","Yeah, so dangerous!"
485,"00:47:01,043","00:47:03,376","Let's get out of here.
The mountain's up ahead."
486,"00:47:07,682","00:47:09,983","Taste my Falling Leaf
kung fu! Hi-ya!"
487,"00:47:09,985","00:47:11,785","- Stop!
- Huh?"
488,"00:47:11,787","00:47:13,687",Hm.
489,"00:47:16,825","00:47:20,229","This way, this way.
This way."
490,"00:47:21,563","00:47:23,829",Heh!
491,"00:47:29,771","00:47:32,107",Oh! Huh?
492,"00:47:37,746","00:47:39,479",Go away.
493,"00:47:43,584","00:47:45,484","Hurry, up here!"
494,"00:47:45,486","00:47:47,287",Stop right there!
495,"00:47:47,289","00:47:49,488",And that's my Power Kick!
496,"00:47:51,260","00:47:53,593",Huh?
497,"00:47:53,595","00:47:55,365",Huh?
498,"00:48:02,637","00:48:04,470",He isn't wearing the necklace.
499,"00:48:04,472","00:48:06,640","Where did it go, huh?"
500,"00:48:06,642","00:48:08,642",Could it be in the lake?
501,"00:48:08,644","00:48:10,609","Here's surveillance footage,"
502,"00:48:10,611","00:48:12,713","from before he fell
into the lake,"
503,"00:48:12,715","00:48:14,481","when he came
onto the property."
504,"00:48:14,483","00:48:16,082","He's not wearing
the necklace."
505,"00:48:33,235","00:48:36,102","The boss is upstairs.
How come you're here?"
506,"00:48:36,104","00:48:37,840",It's you!
507,"00:48:40,508","00:48:42,274",What are you doing?
508,"00:48:42,276","00:48:44,811",Training. I want to jump out.
509,"00:48:44,813","00:48:46,912",You've no idea.
510,"00:48:46,914","00:48:50,850","On the last day of every month,
he chooses one animal"
511,"00:48:50,852","00:48:55,354","to make a mould for those
terrifying sculptures of his..."
512,"00:48:55,356","00:48:57,325",..alive!
513,"00:48:58,961","00:49:00,827",The boss says that doing this
514,"00:49:00,829","00:49:02,863","gives the work
its special spark."
515,"00:49:02,865","00:49:05,332",As for those animals here...
516,"00:49:08,369","00:49:11,807","..today... today is
the last day of the month."
517,"00:49:14,709","00:49:16,575","Uh, you..."
518,"00:49:16,577","00:49:18,311",You're...
519,"00:49:18,313","00:49:21,948","Little Blanket,
all grown up."
520,"00:49:38,499","00:49:41,100","Cape's been here?
And they've taken him?"
521,"00:49:41,102","00:49:43,803",Mm.
522,"00:49:43,805","00:49:46,008",I have to save him.
523,"00:49:53,816","00:49:56,084",There's electricity.
524,"00:49:58,820","00:50:01,289","- Blanket!
- Blanket!"
525,"00:50:02,825","00:50:05,091",Blanket!
526,"00:50:06,762","00:50:08,327",Ooh!
527,"00:50:10,698","00:50:12,635",Agh!
528,"00:50:20,142","00:50:22,776",Blanket!
529,"00:50:22,778","00:50:26,048",Must... find Cape...
530,"00:50:32,621","00:50:34,720",Huh?
531,"00:50:42,064","00:50:44,164",The boss is coming.
532,"00:50:55,142","00:50:58,077","So, I guess today is the day
for a new mould."
533,"00:50:58,079","00:51:00,146","What are you thinking, huh?"
534,"00:51:00,148","00:51:02,883","Listen, I had the raccoons
out on patrol."
535,"00:51:02,885","00:51:04,584",Look! They got lucky.
536,"00:51:04,586","00:51:07,354","They were able to catch
some rare specimens."
537,"00:51:07,356","00:51:09,158","Untie them and chuck 'em in.
Be quick."
538,"00:51:11,360","00:51:13,392",Look here. Look at this.
539,"00:51:13,394","00:51:16,262","The wild ones
have great musculature."
540,"00:51:16,264","00:51:19,334","The long-termers
get a bit withered."
541,"00:51:20,869","00:51:23,372","So, tell me, boss,
which one inspires you?"
542,"00:51:25,807","00:51:28,343","Oh, how's this one here?"
543,"00:51:29,510","00:51:31,811",Or... or this one?
544,"00:51:31,813","00:51:33,479",This?
545,"00:51:33,481","00:51:35,015",This?
546,"00:51:35,017","00:51:36,152",This?
547,"00:51:49,731","00:51:51,965",Him!
548,"00:51:51,967","00:51:54,501","Oh! But what about
the necklace?"
549,"00:51:54,503","00:51:57,336","- Any news of it?
- Uh, still none."
550,"00:51:57,338","00:51:59,472",Still no news of it?
551,"00:52:01,977","00:52:06,178","The necklace is lost, just
like... my inspiration is gone!"
552,"00:52:06,180","00:52:08,481","I can't make anything,
nothing sells!"
553,"00:52:08,483","00:52:11,153","This factory
is completely doomed!"
554,"00:52:12,387","00:52:16,622","Since it's doomed,
I want you to make me moulds"
555,"00:52:16,624","00:52:20,496","from all of them, one by one,
until they're all dead."
556,"00:52:22,164","00:52:25,101",Cats! Cats are the worst.
557,"00:52:26,635","00:52:28,934",Start with him!
558,"00:52:28,936","00:52:31,470","Torment him to death,"
559,"00:52:31,472","00:52:33,441",then throw him in the kiln!
560,"00:52:37,111","00:52:39,111",Understood?
561,"00:52:39,113","00:52:42,048","You know, in the past,
if an artist was blocked,"
562,"00:52:42,050","00:52:44,818","he would throw
a live animal into the kiln."
563,"00:52:44,820","00:52:46,889",It was called a sacrifice.
564,"00:52:48,456","00:52:51,957","Actually, it's a shame
to burn them in the kiln."
565,"00:52:54,128","00:52:56,129","Exactly.
These four-legged creatures"
566,"00:52:56,131","00:52:58,698","who've run in the woods
make great stew."
567,"00:52:58,700","00:53:00,566",True. They're so gamey.
568,"00:53:00,568","00:53:02,404",They make delicious soup.
569,"00:53:03,671","00:53:06,039",Whoa!
570,"00:53:06,041","00:53:08,240","- You bumped into me!
- What's wrong with you two?"
571,"00:53:08,242","00:53:10,075","- It was him.
- You must be blind."
572,"00:53:10,077","00:53:12,879",Because I... I didn't!
573,"00:53:17,519","00:53:19,956","We'll look for Cape
in the morning."
574,"00:53:24,492","00:53:26,828","Blanket, look."
575,"00:53:27,963","00:53:29,662",My mate.
576,"00:53:29,664","00:53:32,798",Later we had Cape.
577,"00:53:32,800","00:53:36,803","You can't imagine
how tiny he was at first,"
578,"00:53:36,805","00:53:40,106","and so adorably pink,
with his closed eyes."
579,"00:53:40,108","00:53:43,142","He opened his eyes
and he looked at me."
580,"00:53:43,144","00:53:44,878",My son.
581,"00:53:44,880","00:53:46,282","You're a dad, Blanket."
582,"00:53:50,184","00:53:51,953",And even later...
583,"00:54:17,746","00:54:21,080","Blanket!
You stay right here!"
584,"00:54:46,842","00:54:49,175","I haven't been
a good protector,"
585,"00:54:49,177","00:54:51,343",but I have to protect him.
586,"00:54:51,345","00:54:53,713","I must find Cape!
I'm going now!"
587,"00:54:53,715","00:54:55,517",Now?
588,"00:55:28,182","00:55:30,015",Cape! Cape!
589,"00:55:30,017","00:55:32,251",Huh?
590,"00:55:32,253","00:55:35,687","Cape! On your right!
On your right!"
591,"00:55:35,689","00:55:37,457","Hey, hey."
592,"00:55:37,459","00:55:39,124","- Hey.
- Huh?"
593,"00:55:39,126","00:55:41,126",Look. There's a parrot.
594,"00:55:41,128","00:55:43,363",Aunty Mack!
595,"00:55:46,001","00:55:49,602","Hey, Cape. Your dad and I
are here to save you!"
596,"00:55:49,604","00:55:53,372","- Dad's here?
- Yes, your dad. He's the best!"
597,"00:55:53,374","00:55:56,341","He jumped out the window and
followed you across the river."
598,"00:55:56,343","00:55:58,644",He fought cormorants and goats.
599,"00:55:58,646","00:56:00,613",And now he's here to save you.
600,"00:56:00,615","00:56:02,515","- Of course, there's me too.
- Daddy!"
601,"00:56:02,517","00:56:04,983",Huh?
602,"00:56:10,457","00:56:12,160",Huh?
603,"00:56:13,561","00:56:15,528","- Agh!
- Just wait."
604,"00:56:15,530","00:56:18,231","We're coming back to save you!
And the others too."
605,"00:56:18,233","00:56:20,166","- All of you!
- I'll get you!"
606,"00:56:20,168","00:56:23,970","- My daddy?
- That grey cat is your father?"
607,"00:56:23,972","00:56:26,405","We met that grey cat.
He's your dad?"
608,"00:56:26,407","00:56:29,776","He's a kung fu warrior.
His skills are extraordinary."
609,"00:56:29,778","00:56:31,477",He's coming to save us?
610,"00:56:31,479","00:56:33,646",Your dad is formidable.
611,"00:56:33,648","00:56:37,316","- My dad!
- Wonderful! Wonderful!"
612,"00:56:37,318","00:56:38,917",It's so wonderful.
613,"00:56:38,919","00:56:41,823",Ugh!
614,"00:56:43,157","00:56:46,191","My dad's gonna save me.
I'm getting out of here!"
615,"00:56:46,193","00:56:49,294","The last time that I escaped,"
616,"00:56:49,296","00:56:52,635","I waited until the raccoons
went on their meal break."
617,"00:56:56,371","00:56:58,437",I reached out...
618,"00:56:58,439","00:57:01,506","..and grabbed
that stiff, heavy lock."
619,"00:57:01,508","00:57:03,475",I pulled and pulled...
620,"00:57:03,477","00:57:06,014",..and I escaped!
621,"00:57:09,550","00:57:11,686","Take that, you stupid monkey."
622,"00:57:12,854","00:57:14,687",Now the lock's too far away.
623,"00:57:14,689","00:57:16,725",There's no way I can reach it.
624,"00:57:21,095","00:57:23,129","- I have a way.
- Huh?"
625,"00:57:23,131","00:57:25,465","- Huh?
- Oh, oh! Tell us!"
626,"00:57:25,467","00:57:27,934",What is it? Tell us!
627,"00:57:37,979","00:57:40,182",Huh? What?
628,"00:57:46,521","00:57:49,655",Oh! Oh!
629,"00:57:49,657","00:57:51,624",Ow.
630,"00:57:51,626","00:57:53,992","Ow, that hurts!"
631,"00:57:53,994","00:57:56,531",Go get ready!
632,"00:58:05,340","00:58:08,140","Almost there, guys."
633,"00:58:08,142","00:58:10,443",It's not strong enough.
634,"00:58:10,445","00:58:12,778",Huh?
635,"00:58:12,780","00:58:14,483","Support it, quick!"
636,"00:58:22,456","00:58:24,159","Quick, quick, quick!"
637,"00:58:25,459","00:58:27,626",Huh?
638,"00:58:27,628","00:58:30,262","- Someone's here!
- Hurry!"
639,"00:58:44,845","00:58:47,248",I'm an idiot. You pull this one.
640,"00:58:50,751","00:58:52,587",Huh?
641,"00:58:58,959","00:59:01,530","Hah! You're playing with
your feeders now, huh?"
642,"00:59:02,831","00:59:05,133","Here's some plastic bags.
Play with these."
643,"00:59:07,468","00:59:10,602","- Did you find Cape?
- Yeah, I did. I found him."
644,"00:59:10,604","00:59:13,271","He's trapped
in a teeny, tiny little cage."
645,"00:59:13,273","00:59:15,043","Oh, poor Cape."
646,"00:59:16,276","00:59:18,977","What's to think about?
Let's go already!"
647,"00:59:18,979","00:59:20,912","- We...
- Hey, raccoons outside."
648,"00:59:20,914","00:59:22,717",Take it.
649,"00:59:36,097","00:59:39,097","I'm pretty smart too.
But where could I go?"
650,"00:59:39,099","00:59:43,736","Out there is a very cruel
and ruthless world."
651,"00:59:45,740","00:59:49,075","We raccoons,
we get run over by cars,"
652,"00:59:49,077","00:59:50,977",get kicked or chased by kids.
653,"00:59:50,979","00:59:53,780","At best, we raccoons
end up in a cage at the zoo."
654,"00:59:53,782","00:59:56,282",A cage.
655,"00:59:56,284","01:00:01,153","Worst-case scenario, we land
in a pot of raccoon soup."
656,"01:00:01,155","01:00:03,257",Terrifying. Terrifying.
657,"01:00:15,503","01:00:18,307",Hm.
658,"01:00:19,640","01:00:22,543","You're a smart raccoon.
You know the truth."
659,"01:00:26,447","01:00:29,215",Humph.
660,"01:00:29,217","01:00:32,617","They say you cats
only look after yourselves."
661,"01:00:32,619","01:00:34,720","Cats also mind
their own business."
662,"01:00:34,722","01:00:37,557",Good. How's this?
663,"01:00:37,559","01:00:41,461","You're no stranger, so I'm
giving you a choice here, OK?"
664,"01:00:41,463","01:00:44,196","You give up the cat
and the necklace"
665,"01:00:44,198","01:00:46,365","and nothing changes, OK?"
666,"01:00:46,367","01:00:49,367","Or you can just hand over
the necklace."
667,"01:00:49,369","01:00:53,238","But that's the end
of your precious little bar."
668,"01:00:53,240","01:00:56,075","Getting a choice
does have its price."
669,"01:00:56,077","01:00:58,744","Now, I... I can set you free,"
670,"01:00:58,746","01:01:01,383","and you leave this place
with the grey cat."
671,"01:01:02,916","01:01:05,318","Which do you think
I'll choose?"
672,"01:01:05,320","01:01:09,321","Each option has its benefits
and its price as well."
673,"01:01:09,323","01:01:11,390",It's not easy.
674,"01:01:11,392","01:01:13,925","No, it's not easy.
Not easy at all."
675,"01:01:13,927","01:01:16,329","Is this not
the agony of choice?"
676,"01:01:16,331","01:01:18,865",And the fun of it all too?
677,"01:01:31,012","01:01:33,278","I overheard your conversation
just now."
678,"01:01:33,280","01:01:34,646",I'll rescue Cape myself.
679,"01:01:34,648","01:01:37,517","- What the raccoon said...
- It makes sense."
680,"01:01:37,519","01:01:40,151",I heard what you said too.
681,"01:01:40,153","01:01:42,053",I was just humouring him.
682,"01:01:42,055","01:01:44,323","I won't make things
hard for you."
683,"01:01:44,325","01:01:46,227",You don't have to choose.
684,"01:01:52,032","01:01:53,899",Have the necklace.
685,"01:01:53,901","01:01:56,068","So, you're off to save Cape?"
686,"01:01:56,070","01:01:57,870","Worst-case,
I fail and get caught."
687,"01:01:57,872","01:02:00,372",I'll be with him then.
688,"01:02:00,374","01:02:03,142","- Let's go, Mack.
- Yeah."
689,"01:02:16,691","01:02:19,828","- Let's go! It's mould time.
- Move it."
690,"01:02:32,807","01:02:34,840",It's somewhere near here.
691,"01:02:34,842","01:02:36,943","Come on, let's look over there."
692,"01:02:36,945","01:02:38,780",Go.
693,"01:03:11,479","01:03:13,916",Cape!
694,"01:03:21,956","01:03:24,856","No, Cape."
695,"01:04:01,162","01:04:03,497",Daddy! Daddy!
696,"01:04:06,166","01:04:09,371",I'm over here!
697,"01:04:15,410","01:04:17,346",Whoa! Hey!
698,"01:04:51,512","01:04:53,215",Daddy!
699,"01:04:59,019","01:05:00,952","- They got Dad!
- Cape!"
700,"01:05:00,954","01:05:03,455","He's in danger!
They think I died!"
701,"01:05:03,457","01:05:07,158","I have to get him!
I have to tell him I'm alive!"
702,"01:05:07,160","01:05:09,061","- You can't save him.
- I have to save him!"
703,"01:05:09,063","01:05:11,166",Cape!
704,"01:05:15,903","01:05:18,570",Cape!
705,"01:05:18,572","01:05:20,805","- Let me go!
- Your dad wants you to be safe."
706,"01:05:20,807","01:05:23,776","- You're all he has.
- No! I have to save my dad."
707,"01:05:23,778","01:05:26,479","We're going to Peachtopia
to find Mom!"
708,"01:05:26,481","01:05:28,747",Your mom isn't in Peachtopia.
709,"01:05:31,251","01:05:33,619",She's not in Peachtopia?
710,"01:05:33,621","01:05:35,653",Mama...
711,"01:05:35,655","01:05:38,090",There's only me?
712,"01:05:39,860","01:05:42,997","Your mom died long ago.
Your dad told me."
713,"01:05:44,131","01:05:46,300",You're lying.
714,"01:05:52,874","01:05:58,144","Maybe we can use this.
There's you too."
715,"01:06:13,994","01:06:16,829",Biggie! Biggie!
716,"01:06:16,831","01:06:18,763",Huh?
717,"01:06:18,765","01:06:21,903","- Look who's here.
- Huh?"
718,"01:06:31,077","01:06:33,646","But things have changed
drastically."
719,"01:06:33,648","01:06:36,981","The fat cat is now in my hands,
not in yours."
720,"01:06:36,983","01:06:40,251","I'll give you the necklace and
I'll give you the kitten too."
721,"01:06:40,253","01:06:43,354","You give me the grey cat
and let us leave this place."
722,"01:06:43,356","01:06:48,593","Oh, so the fat grey cat means
a lot to you, does he, huh?"
723,"01:06:48,595","01:06:50,629",He saved my life.
724,"01:06:50,631","01:06:53,832",Hmm. Sounds reasonable.
725,"01:06:53,834","01:06:59,470","But then what if this is just
a little dirty trick, huh?"
726,"01:06:59,472","01:07:02,474","On your territory.
We'll do the trade in your HQ."
727,"01:07:02,476","01:07:04,609",Hmm.
728,"01:07:04,611","01:07:06,711","OK. You've got yourself
a deal."
729,"01:07:06,713","01:07:09,448","You had to make
a tough choice,"
730,"01:07:09,450","01:07:11,983","but it's still better
than not making one at all."
731,"01:07:11,985","01:07:15,653","You did, and I'm very happy."
732,"01:07:17,724","01:07:21,630","Actually, when you go,
I'm going to miss you."
733,"01:07:27,568","01:07:30,236",Hurry! Move it!
734,"01:07:36,843","01:07:38,744",Huh?
735,"01:07:40,581","01:07:42,615","- Daddy!
- Huh?"
736,"01:07:42,617","01:07:45,517","- It's Cape! You're alive?
- Yes, Dad, I'm alive!"
737,"01:07:45,519","01:07:48,820",Cape's alive! My son is alive!
738,"01:07:48,822","01:07:51,490",Cape's alive! He didn't die!
739,"01:07:51,492","01:07:53,358",He's alive!
740,"01:07:53,360","01:07:55,961","- Let me go!
- OK, let's do it."
741,"01:07:55,963","01:07:58,600","You take the grey cat
and I keep the kitten."
742,"01:08:00,367","01:08:02,269",Sorry.
743,"01:08:03,470","01:08:05,271","- Now, let's go.
- No!"
744,"01:08:05,273","01:08:07,472",Let my son go! Let my son go!
745,"01:08:11,211","01:08:14,113",Sorry. I change my mind a lot.
746,"01:08:14,115","01:08:16,649","I've thought it over.
Not gonna happen."
747,"01:08:16,651","01:08:18,950","- I have to take you hostage.
- You..."
748,"01:08:18,952","01:08:21,720","Son, you're alive!"
749,"01:08:21,722","01:08:23,321",Wonderful. So wonderful!
750,"01:08:23,323","01:08:25,126",Daddy!
751,"01:08:27,461","01:08:30,062",Kidnapping me is no use.
752,"01:08:30,064","01:08:33,231","Out there are men, walls,
electric fences."
753,"01:08:33,233","01:08:36,467","You already know
this is a place of no exit."
754,"01:08:36,469","01:08:39,070","I know that.
We're in, not going out."
755,"01:08:44,911","01:08:47,111",Move.
756,"01:08:47,113","01:08:49,580",Cape! Little Cape! Blanket!
757,"01:08:51,485","01:08:53,819","You're awesome, Cape!"
758,"01:09:05,165","01:09:07,800","Little Cape, what a hero."
759,"01:09:07,802","01:09:09,767",You saved all of us!
760,"01:09:09,769","01:09:11,537","You're awesome, Cape."
761,"01:09:11,539","01:09:15,110",Hah!
762,"01:09:16,076","01:09:17,811",Blanket.
763,"01:09:21,615","01:09:23,585","- Hey, Cape.
- Huh?"
764,"01:09:29,290","01:09:32,257","What now?
You still can't get out."
765,"01:09:32,259","01:09:34,726",Hmm. We're not leaving.
766,"01:09:34,728","01:09:36,928","Right, we're going
all the way in."
767,"01:09:36,930","01:09:39,465",To Peachtopia!
768,"01:09:39,467","01:09:42,633","Look, Cape, I'm sorry."
769,"01:09:42,635","01:09:44,502",I never told you.
770,"01:09:44,504","01:09:47,007",Your mom isn't at Peachtopia.
771,"01:09:51,411","01:09:55,146","That's OK.
Daddy, I already knew that."
772,"01:09:55,148","01:09:57,516","Everyone, come with me!"
773,"01:09:57,518","01:09:59,688",Huh?
774,"01:10:08,795","01:10:10,796",Hmm!
775,"01:10:10,798","01:10:13,364","- Everyone, do as I say!
- OK."
776,"01:10:13,366","01:10:15,501",First group! Second group!
777,"01:10:15,503","01:10:17,302",Third group! Hurry!
778,"01:10:32,952","01:10:35,790",Quick! Come on.
779,"01:10:42,028","01:10:43,831",What is going on?
780,"01:10:50,905","01:10:54,009","- Huh?
- Grab them all! Now!"
781,"01:10:55,576","01:10:57,245",Mm.
782,"01:11:07,420","01:11:09,057","Quick, everyone inside."
783,"01:11:26,773","01:11:28,675",Whoa!
784,"01:11:44,125","01:11:46,528","- Daddy!
- Oh!"
785,"01:11:53,800","01:11:56,568","Daddy, Daddy! Hurry!"
786,"01:12:23,363","01:12:25,799","Oh, no. It got stuck!"
787,"01:12:43,116","01:12:45,016","- Argh!
- Daddy!"
788,"01:12:45,018","01:12:47,454","Go, go! Go, go! Daddy!"
789,"01:12:56,664","01:12:58,797",Ya!
790,"01:12:58,799","01:13:00,699",Oh!
791,"01:13:07,040","01:13:08,809",Ooh!
792,"01:13:15,381","01:13:17,783",Daddy! Ugh!
793,"01:13:56,790","01:13:58,657",Yaaa!
794,"01:14:10,403","01:14:12,473",Daddy!
795,"01:14:27,920","01:14:30,254",Cape!
796,"01:15:12,866","01:15:15,132",Thank you so much.
797,"01:15:15,134","01:15:17,668",Heh. I wanted to quit ages ago.
798,"01:15:17,670","01:15:19,439",Huh!
799,"01:15:21,674","01:15:23,343",The necklace! And the bead!
800,"01:15:24,411","01:15:26,578",It's OK.
801,"01:15:26,580","01:15:30,614","It's just an ordinary
glass bead. Just a souvenir."
802,"01:15:30,616","01:15:32,919",Originally he gave it to me.
803,"01:15:34,120","01:15:36,355","When I met him years ago,"
804,"01:15:36,357","01:15:39,458","he was a poor worker
with big ideas."
805,"01:15:39,460","01:15:41,626",He said I inspired him.
806,"01:15:41,628","01:15:43,965","I inspired his first
cat sculptures."
807,"01:15:45,765","01:15:48,499","The bead's lovely
mutating colours"
808,"01:15:48,501","01:15:51,269","were like the inspiration
he chased."
809,"01:15:51,271","01:15:54,041","The workshop
was his Peachtopia."
810,"01:15:55,174","01:15:58,843","Later he went too far,"
811,"01:15:58,845","01:16:01,148",into the dark side.
812,"01:16:02,215","01:16:04,184",So I left.
813,"01:16:05,552","01:16:09,523",Later we both changed.
814,"01:16:13,160","01:16:15,127",Oh!
815,"01:16:20,467","01:16:24,302","And Peachtopia,
does it really exist?"
816,"01:16:24,304","01:16:28,009",Look. It's there.
817,"01:16:29,143","01:16:31,510",Ooh.
818,"01:16:31,512","01:16:36,284",Ohhh!
819,"01:16:37,851","01:16:40,621","Whoo-hoo!
Full steam ahead."
820,"01:16:59,973","01:17:01,843","Turn right, turn right!"
821,"01:17:27,300","01:17:29,767",Dad. Dad!
822,"01:17:31,638","01:17:34,509",Daddy! Daddy! Wake up!
823,"01:17:35,976","01:17:38,677","- Cape.
- Quick, look!"
824,"01:17:38,679","01:17:40,912","Everyone, wake up! Daddy!"
825,"01:17:43,082","01:17:44,852",Huh?
826,"01:17:49,755","01:17:51,526",Hurry!
827,"01:17:53,360","01:17:55,627",Wow!
828,"01:18:10,611","01:18:13,613",Wow!
829,"01:18:24,323","01:18:26,827",Whee!
830,"01:19:06,866","01:19:10,435",Whoa! Yeah!
831,"01:19:10,437","01:19:12,870",Whoa!
832,"01:19:47,174","01:19:50,240","Whoo! Yeah!
We're free!"
833,"01:19:53,613","01:19:55,650",Huh?
834,"01:20:28,014","01:20:29,980",I want to go home.
835,"01:20:29,982","01:20:34,019","That flat across the river,
that's my home."
836,"01:20:34,021","01:20:35,854","- Daddy?
- Huh?"
837,"01:20:35,856","01:20:38,288","How about I go back home
with you?"
838,"01:20:38,290","01:20:41,626","I know that not everyone
has a home to go to."
839,"01:20:44,464","01:20:49,300","Hey, son, this giant world
is all yours."
840,"01:20:49,302","01:20:53,137","Go. Experience it, be daring."
841,"01:20:53,139","01:20:56,408","But if... if one day
you miss home,"
842,"01:20:56,410","01:20:59,880","you know that your home
is wherever I am."
843,"01:21:09,923","01:21:13,728","Take care, take care,
my sweet, little Cape!"
844,"01:21:20,666","01:21:22,600",I'm going too.
845,"01:21:22,602","01:21:25,369","My mother isn't here
in Peachtopia."
846,"01:21:25,371","01:21:26,971","Where will you go, then?"
847,"01:21:26,973","01:21:29,173",Hmm. I don't know.
848,"01:21:29,175","01:21:32,377","Wherever I want to go.
Somewhere."
849,"01:21:32,379","01:21:34,314","'Bye, guys!"
850,"01:21:37,317","01:21:39,984",What about us?
851,"01:21:39,986","01:21:42,654",This place doesn't suit me.
852,"01:21:42,656","01:21:44,556",Peachtopia isn't my home.
853,"01:21:44,558","01:21:47,057","No-one knows me
or is waiting for me."
854,"01:21:47,059","01:21:50,395","It doesn't suit
an old stray cat like me."
855,"01:21:50,397","01:21:54,699","Why is any place you can get to
never where you want to be?"
856,"01:21:54,701","01:21:57,202","If you can't find home
in your heart,"
857,"01:21:57,204","01:21:59,069",you won't find it anywhere.
858,"01:21:59,071","01:22:03,807","Even still, this is
a pretty good place to live."
859,"01:22:03,809","01:22:06,677","Set up a guard post.
Yeah, I could do that."
860,"01:22:06,679","01:22:08,812","Keep it from humans
a while longer."
861,"01:22:08,814","01:22:11,315",I'll open another bar.
862,"01:22:11,317","01:22:14,554","You need
a business partner?"
863,"01:22:22,262","01:22:24,194","Daddy, Daddy!"
864,"01:22:24,196","01:22:26,163","You only saw Mom fall, right?"
865,"01:22:26,165","01:22:29,436","Maybe she's still alive
somewhere!"
866,"01:22:36,343","01:22:40,444","Wherever I go,
my mother might be there."
867,"01:22:40,446","01:22:42,646","I'm coming, Mom!"
868,"01:22:42,648","01:22:44,617","I'm coming, big world."
869,"01:22:47,153","01:22:49,154",Hah!
870,"01:22:49,156","01:22:52,190","Since I was little,
I've dreamt of Peachtopia."
871,"01:22:52,192","01:22:55,392",And here it is.
872,"01:22:55,394","01:22:58,232","But Peachtopia
lives in every heart."
873,"01:23:00,332","01:23:03,637","It is such a special place
where you live happily."
874,"01:23:05,405","01:23:09,210","But Cape is off
to see the big world."
875,"01:23:10,544","01:23:12,810",I have a home.
876,"01:23:12,812","01:23:17,317","We all have to let go,
leave, and grow up."
877,"01:23:18,518","01:23:21,452","Maybe that's
the true Peachtopia -"
878,"01:23:21,454","01:23:25,125","a place you long for,
but where you can't stay."
