195,"00:14:44,541","00:14:46,458","Yeah, ghosts of Hawaiian warriors."
196,"00:14:46,541","00:14:49,041","Bobby Shytles told me about it
after his trip to Maui."
197,"00:14:49,666","00:14:52,041",What's Bobby the Turd know about Hawaii?
198,"00:14:53,666","00:14:55,625",What doesn't he know about Hawaii?
199,"00:14:56,250","00:14:57,916","He said they march at night,"
200,"00:14:58,416","00:15:00,041",protecting the island.

when you hear their drums."
202,"00:15:08,083","00:15:13,083","Ta-ta-ta, ta-ta-ta, ta-ta."
203,"00:15:13,916","00:15:15,416",Then you'll see their torches…
204,"00:15:17,791","00:15:19,625",like a string of lights.
205,"00:15:26,541","00:15:28,666","If you hear their shell horn thing,"
206,"00:15:29,500","00:15:30,625",forget it.
207,"00:15:31,416","00:15:32,416",They're close.
208,"00:15:33,500","00:15:36,166","- And if they find you…
- What?"
209,"00:15:36,250","00:15:38,625","You better kiss the ground
and keep your head down,"
210,"00:15:38,708","00:15:40,166",'cause if not…
211,"00:15:40,958","00:15:43,750","Remember that scene

219,"00:16:29,208","00:16:30,458",Five years!

your property taxes in five years?"
221,"00:16:33,625","00:16:35,833","Why didn't you tell me
you were in trouble?"
222,"00:16:35,916","00:16:37,625",I take care of myself!
223,"00:16:37,708","00:16:40,166","Really?
'Cause you're about to lose your house!"
224,"00:16:40,708","00:16:43,083","Dad, I know you don't want to hear this,"
225,"00:16:43,166","00:16:47,791","but maybe you would be better off
in New York. You could get around easier."
226,"00:16:47,875","00:16:51,125","This is my kuleana.
This is our ohana's land!"
227,"00:16:51,208","00:16:54,333","Not like you,
I'm gonna die before I leave."
228,"00:17:00,125","00:17:04,041","- E, get ready. We're leaving in ten.
- What? Where are you going?"
229,"00:17:04,125","00:17:07,333","We're gonna go pick up Papa's meds
and a new router."
230,"00:17:07,416","00:17:11,125","E said something about needing
a stronger one or something."
231,"00:17:11,208","00:17:13,333",I just need to take care of a few things.
232,"00:17:13,416","00:17:16,166","But I thought
we were gonna go geocaching today."
233,"00:17:16,250","00:17:17,708",I packed for two.
234,"00:17:17,791","00:17:20,250","Oh, Sugarcane. I'm so sorry,"
235,"00:17:20,333","00:17:22,333",not today. Okay?
236,"00:17:22,416","00:17:23,500",Maybe tomorrow.

a bunch of privateers to hide their gold,"
307,"00:21:16,708","00:21:19,916","but then Robinson and Brown
discovered a secret."

317,"00:21:54,125","00:21:56,333",Brown could kill with a piece of bread.
318,"00:21:57,291","00:21:59,958","And as the Peruvian burnt down,"

321,"00:22:07,166","00:22:09,333",And that's when they decided:

- No."
326,"00:22:20,791","00:22:23,791","After they hid the treasure,
Monks stayed behind to guard it"
327,"00:22:23,875","00:22:26,166","while Robinson and Brown
sailed back to England,"
328,"00:22:26,250","00:22:29,000",but their ship never made it.
329,"00:22:29,083","00:22:30,000","Oh, snap!"
330,"00:22:30,083","00:22:33,041","A storm hit their ship

332,"00:22:35,833","00:22:39,041","He was crawling around
in the hot sand. Poor guy."
333,"00:22:39,125","00:22:41,333","He was almost beaten to death
by who?"
334,"00:22:41,416","00:22:45,250","It's a mystery. An old Hawaiian couple
found him just in the nick of time."
335,"00:22:51,458","00:22:55,625","Monks must have given his journal to them
as a thanks for saving his life."
336,"00:22:57,208","00:23:02,333","If Robinson, Brown, and Monks
didn't get to the treasure, where is it?"
337,"00:23:02,416","00:23:03,625",No one knows.
338,"00:23:03,708","00:23:06,000","One theory is Monks told
the couple where it was,"
339,"00:23:06,083","00:23:10,541","but no one's ever cashed in
a fortune's worth of Spanish gold."
340,"00:23:11,208","00:23:13,291",I really gotta finish reading this.

- Mom's room."
348,"00:23:42,541","00:23:44,916","She didn't say I couldn't have it.
I didn't steal it."

Hand it over, mongoose."
350,"00:23:47,791","00:23:50,208","- I'm not a mongoose.

357,"00:24:29,166","00:24:30,916","- Really?
- Really."
358,"00:24:36,333","00:24:40,375","This was my papa's,
who got it from his papa,"
359,"00:24:41,250","00:24:42,791",who got it from Monks.
360,"00:24:42,875","00:24:46,625","So, my great-great-great-great..."
361,"00:24:48,041","00:24:50,333",Our family saved Monks' life?
362,"00:24:50,916","00:24:52,375",And my papa's papa…

364,"00:24:56,291","00:24:59,458","- Woo. Is it real?
- Of course it's real, look again."
365,"00:25:00,500","00:25:01,916",Then where's the rest of it?
366,"00:25:02,000","00:25:04,833","- Why aren't you living in a mansion?

368,"00:25:07,625","00:25:12,083","- We're so lucky for live in Hawaii.

I still got him in my freezer."
379,"00:25:43,208","00:25:44,875",I love them. I ate them all.
380,"00:25:44,958","00:25:47,791","We gotta do it again. If I get to it,
great. If not, no big deal."
381,"00:25:47,875","00:25:51,416","Brah, I know you can! Guaranteed, brah!"
382,"00:25:52,375","00:25:53,583",What are you guys saying?
383,"00:25:54,166","00:25:55,208",Little Pili.
384,"00:25:55,916","00:25:57,041",Pili?
385,"00:25:57,125","00:25:59,750","Wow! The last time I saw you,
you were a little baby."
386,"00:25:59,833","00:26:01,875","Here, I make some musubi for you."
387,"00:26:01,958","00:26:05,916","And please, tell your mom aloha for me.
It's been a long time since I've seen her."
388,"00:26:06,000","00:26:07,916","- Yeah.
- Let's go to the boat."
389,"00:26:08,000","00:26:09,125",All right.
390,"00:26:17,708","00:26:20,375","Watch out for the reef.
Catch you folks on by."
391,"00:26:20,458","00:26:21,458","'Kay, brah."
392,"00:26:21,875","00:26:24,833","Slick shoes.
You know you're gonna get them wet?"
393,"00:26:24,916","00:26:27,250","Hey, come on. We gotta go.
Come on. Let's go."
394,"00:26:29,125","00:26:31,208","You guys know I can't swim, right?"
395,"00:26:39,250","00:26:40,750",Grab the steering wheel.
396,"00:26:41,250","00:26:44,791","What kind of Hawaiian
are you going to be if you no can swim?"
397,"00:26:44,875","00:26:48,750","We don't have to swim across rivers
in New York. We got trains for that."
398,"00:26:48,833","00:26:52,000","Papa gonna teach you,
if you don't drown first."
399,"00:26:52,083","00:26:55,375","Quick, put this on. Quick. Put 'em on."
400,"00:26:57,125","00:26:58,250",Attagirl!
401,"00:26:59,083","00:27:00,583","Here we go, brah!"
402,"00:27:00,666","00:27:03,625","- Woohoo!
- Woohoo!"
403,"00:27:03,708","00:27:05,333",All right!
404,"00:27:11,375","00:27:12,500",Woo!
405,"00:27:23,625","00:27:27,583","As I was saying,
New York has real winters, though."
406,"00:27:27,666","00:27:30,583","It isn't really Christmas
until the air is so cold,"
407,"00:27:30,666","00:27:32,208",your lungs burn when you breathe.
408,"00:27:32,291","00:27:35,333","Wait.
No Mele Kalikimaka until your lungs hurt?"
409,"00:27:35,416","00:27:37,541",Christmas in New York is the best.
410,"00:27:38,291","00:27:40,291",Open the bag. Let's see what we got.
411,"00:27:41,583","00:27:44,125","Oh, spam musubi made by Keoki."
412,"00:27:48,333","00:27:49,333",Go ahead.
413,"00:27:50,541","00:27:52,083",All right.
414,"00:27:53,750","00:27:55,250","- Mmm.
- Mmm?"
415,"00:27:55,333","00:27:56,333",Mmm!
416,"00:27:56,708","00:27:57,708",Mmm.
417,"00:27:57,791","00:28:00,333","You know,
New York's not always cold."
418,"00:28:00,416","00:28:03,250","You've never been.
Maybe you should come visit."
419,"00:28:04,291","00:28:07,458","Cannot be as beautiful as this island,
the people."
420,"00:28:08,583","00:28:11,291",We live aloha.
421,"00:28:11,375","00:28:14,291","Aloha is how we treat ourselves,"
422,"00:28:14,916","00:28:16,250","how we help others,"
423,"00:28:17,000","00:28:18,583",how we know…
424,"00:28:19,291","00:28:22,791",where we supposed to be in this life.
425,"00:28:22,875","00:28:26,208",Kuleana. Our responsibility.
426,"00:28:26,291","00:28:28,208",How we take care of the island.
427,"00:28:28,291","00:28:31,208","And aloha's a big part of you.
You know why?"
428,"00:28:31,291","00:28:32,291",Because you…
429,"00:28:33,541","00:28:37,083","Hawaiian… and you get koko,"
430,"00:28:38,041","00:28:39,333",Hawaiian blood.
431,"00:28:44,416","00:28:46,791","Hey, look over there. What do you see?"
432,"00:28:48,333","00:28:49,458",Mountains?
433,"00:28:58,166","00:28:59,875",This is where they first landed!
434,"00:28:59,958","00:29:00,958",Ae.
435,"00:29:07,750","00:29:08,833",Where are you going?
436,"00:29:10,625","00:29:13,500",Look! It's Robinson and Brown's mark.
437,"00:29:14,083","00:29:15,791","Oh, you speak Spanish, yeah?"
438,"00:29:15,875","00:29:20,000","I had to translate it one word at a time
and it took me forever."
439,"00:29:20,083","00:29:23,916","So these Post-it notes in Hawaiian,
these are you?"
440,"00:29:24,000","00:29:25,000",Ae.
441,"00:29:26,333","00:29:29,916","""We placed the jewel inside the crown"
442,"00:29:30,000","00:29:32,458","and marked it with gold."""
443,"00:29:37,375","00:29:39,458",Go ahead. Look through.
444,"00:29:40,041","00:29:41,875",Take a look over there.
445,"00:29:49,958","00:29:51,375",Is that where Monks went?
446,"00:29:51,958","00:29:55,208","Is that where we have to go next
to find the treasure?"
447,"00:29:56,000","00:30:00,083","There is no treasure.
The book is the treasure."
448,"00:30:03,541","00:30:04,541",Here.
449,"00:30:06,291","00:30:07,750","Hey, where you going?"
450,"00:30:07,833","00:30:11,083","I want to make sure the coin shows
the same spot from higher up."
451,"00:30:12,083","00:30:15,500","- Papa don't like you going up there.
- Why, is it dangerous?"
452,"00:30:15,583","00:30:19,666","Of course it's dangerous. Tourists ruined
the road up there. It's all eroded."
453,"00:30:19,750","00:30:22,000",I'm small. It'll be fine.
454,"00:30:22,083","00:30:25,875","Pilialoha, get down here right now!"
455,"00:30:25,958","00:30:27,875","Don't worry, I'll be right back!"
456,"00:30:31,625","00:30:32,625",Papa!
457,"00:30:36,958","00:30:38,625",Service. Service.
458,"00:30:38,708","00:30:39,708",Yes!
459,"00:30:40,833","00:30:43,041",Er. Ioane.
460,"00:30:44,416","00:30:47,666","- E. Can I talk to you for a second?
- Yeah."
461,"00:30:48,583","00:30:52,000","Also, where are we going?
I don't see a Best Buy anywhere."
462,"00:30:53,500","00:30:56,000",Hold on. Let me pull over.
463,"00:30:59,291","00:31:01,916","Ioane, I have to talk to you
about something."
464,"00:31:02,791","00:31:03,791",So…
465,"00:31:04,375","00:31:07,791","Papa is having a hard time
paying his bills, and…"
466,"00:31:08,541","00:31:10,166",he might lose his house.
467,"00:31:10,250","00:31:14,625","So, property values in Greenpoint
have gone up..."
468,"00:31:14,708","00:31:17,541","You want to sell our apartment
to pay his bills."
469,"00:31:17,625","00:31:19,750",Please just try to understand.
470,"00:31:19,833","00:31:22,500","That land has been in our family
for generations."
471,"00:31:22,583","00:31:25,833","- It's our home.
- We grew up in New York. It's our home."
472,"00:31:25,916","00:31:29,125","Papa built that house
with his own two hands."
473,"00:31:29,208","00:31:31,291","He had a heart attack
and we were not there!"
474,"00:31:31,375","00:31:33,666","You're hardly there for us
and we live with you!"
475,"00:31:35,458","00:31:39,291","Do you know how hard it is to raise
two kids alone in New York?"
476,"00:31:39,375","00:31:40,375","Yes, Mom."
477,"00:31:40,875","00:31:43,875","Every time I hit the bodega,
or I make dinner,"
478,"00:31:43,958","00:31:46,083",or I do laundry because you can't.
479,"00:31:48,250","00:31:49,250",That's not fair.
480,"00:31:50,750","00:31:53,083",What's not fair is losing my whole life
481,"00:31:53,166","00:31:56,458","because you feel guilty about
leaving Hawaii when Dad died."
482,"00:31:56,541","00:31:57,666",How dare you!
483,"00:32:06,625","00:32:07,458",Hello?
484,"00:32:07,541","00:32:11,416","- Mom, something happened to Papa!
- Pili, slow down. I can't understand..."
485,"00:32:11,500","00:32:13,333",Hurry! Something happened to Papa!
486,"00:32:14,166","00:32:15,166",We gotta go.
487,"00:32:15,541","00:32:18,625","- Are you gonna have him stay overnight?
- Yeah."
488,"00:32:18,708","00:32:21,000","- With his medical history…
- Pils."
489,"00:32:31,625","00:32:32,625",Hey.
490,"00:32:33,125","00:32:35,208",It's just a broken rib. He'll live.
491,"00:32:36,125","00:32:38,791","- You should be more worried about us.
- Huh?"
492,"00:32:39,500","00:32:42,375","If Mom can't pay off Papa's bills,
he's not moving to Brooklyn..."
493,"00:32:42,458","00:32:43,916",He said he'd rather die.
494,"00:32:44,000","00:32:45,125",Which is why Mom told me
495,"00:32:45,208","00:32:47,541","she wants to sell our apartment
and move us here."
496,"00:32:48,583","00:32:52,375","I know. Jessica Riley just told me
she was gonna make out with me,"
497,"00:32:52,458","00:32:55,625","and I'm not spending my senior year
stuck on this stupid island."
498,"00:32:59,541","00:33:02,000",Papa? Is he okay? What did they say?
499,"00:33:02,083","00:33:04,291","No, Pilialoha, he is not okay."
500,"00:33:04,375","00:33:07,041","I can't believe you asked him
to take you to Mokolli'i!"
501,"00:33:07,125","00:33:09,416","- But I didn't...
- I don't want to hear it."
502,"00:33:09,500","00:33:12,458","They're keeping him overnight,
so I'm gonna stay too."
503,"00:33:13,000","00:33:14,000",You two go home.
504,"00:33:15,625","00:33:18,541","- It wasn't even my...
- I said go home."
505,"00:33:26,750","00:33:30,166",Papa's hurt and it's my fault.
506,"00:33:32,708","00:33:34,916","Oh, no. Please don't cry."
507,"00:33:35,000","00:33:39,041","Don't tell me not to cry
when I'm trying not to. It doesn't help."
508,"00:33:39,916","00:33:41,791",I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
509,"00:33:47,750","00:33:50,291",Ew!
510,"00:33:57,458","00:33:58,750",Kimo's tough.
511,"00:33:58,833","00:34:03,125","One time I saw him invite
two Mormon missionaries in for coffee."
512,"00:34:04,083","00:34:05,083",He'll be okay.
513,"00:34:05,833","00:34:07,666",It's not just that he's hurt.
514,"00:34:08,416","00:34:11,375","He can't pay his bills.
He might lose his house."
515,"00:34:11,458","00:34:13,875",I have to find a way to fix it.
516,"00:34:13,958","00:34:17,833","How? There isn't any gold
at the end of our double rainbows."
517,"00:34:19,583","00:34:21,583",It'd be cool if there were though.
518,"00:34:23,000","00:34:27,208","Pils, geocaching really just snapped
your grasp on reality, hasn't it?"
519,"00:34:27,291","00:34:30,666","Papa said Monks gave it to our family.
It's real gold, E!"
520,"00:34:30,750","00:34:32,958","I bit it, you can see my teeth marks."
521,"00:34:33,041","00:34:35,125",Now I know you're both crazy.
522,"00:34:35,208","00:34:37,625","Why is your hair
the same color as your nips?"
523,"00:34:38,208","00:34:40,208","- Don't objectify him!
- What?"
524,"00:34:40,291","00:34:43,083","No, I didn't mean...
That's not even how you use the word."
525,"00:34:43,166","00:34:46,250","If Mom can't pay Papa's bills,
we gotta leave Brooklyn."
526,"00:34:46,333","00:34:48,041",This is how we can get the money.
527,"00:34:48,125","00:34:49,750","Real money, Pils."
528,"00:34:50,375","00:34:53,208","We need legit bank, not some crusty gelt."
529,"00:34:54,416","00:34:56,208",Fine. Whatever.
530,"00:35:02,791","00:35:06,041",TRUCK
531,"00:35:09,708","00:35:12,916","You can't just walk into Kualoa.
It's trespassing."
532,"00:35:13,500","00:35:15,250",Fine. I'll sneak in.
533,"00:35:15,333","00:35:18,291","- You'll get caught.
- Then I'll pretend I'm lost."
534,"00:35:18,375","00:35:22,791","Trust me,
adults are dumb and I'm adorable."
535,"00:35:22,875","00:35:24,541","But, Pili, Kualoa, it's..."
536,"00:35:24,625","00:35:27,500","I gotta do this, Casper, for Papa."
537,"00:35:31,500","00:35:34,458",Okay. We'll go at dawn.
538,"00:35:35,375","00:35:36,375",We?
539,"00:35:38,416","00:35:39,416",For Mr. Kimo.
540,"00:36:07,125","00:36:08,375","D is for Drive, right?"
541,"00:36:09,333","00:36:11,250",What? You said you knew how to drive.
542,"00:36:11,333","00:36:12,958",Chill. I know what I'm doing.
543,"00:36:14,666","00:36:17,291",Hold your tater tots.
544,"00:36:33,750","00:36:38,083","Wow, it sure is quiet here.
You know folks in New York honk 24/7?"
545,"00:36:38,166","00:36:40,625",This is Hawaii. Honking is rude.
546,"00:36:41,166","00:36:45,166","Pili, please pull over. I don't feel good.
I think I'm gonna lose it."
547,"00:36:54,500","00:36:56,041",I wasn't that bad.
548,"00:36:56,125","00:36:58,291","Come on, Barfy. Let's go!"
549,"00:37:03,541","00:37:07,541","NOTICE - EMPLOYEES ONLY
VISITORS PLEASE USE FRONT ENTRANCE"
550,"00:37:07,625","00:37:09,916","- Hold Keanu.
- Okay."
551,"00:37:12,125","00:37:15,916","- It's heavy!
- Oh! Jeez, what do you got in here, dude?"
552,"00:37:16,000","00:37:17,000",KUALOA RANCH
553,"00:37:17,083","00:37:20,500","So you're telling me that people
come here just to see a few hills?"
554,"00:37:20,583","00:37:22,916","Kualoa Valley is sacred Hawaiian land,"
555,"00:37:23,000","00:37:26,000","but also they shoot a lot of movies
like Jurassic Park here."
556,"00:37:26,083","00:37:27,708",Really? That's so...
557,"00:37:29,958","00:37:31,083",What?
558,"00:37:31,625","00:37:33,208",Wooo!
559,"00:37:33,291","00:37:35,291","This is dope, yo!"
560,"00:37:36,875","00:37:38,583",Mortimer would have enjoyed this.
561,"00:37:45,458","00:37:47,958","Sorry, Mom. Not the time."

563,"00:38:15,916","00:38:16,833",Huh?
564,"00:38:16,916","00:38:19,833","- Why aren't you answering your cell phone?
- I don't know."
565,"00:38:20,416","00:38:22,125",It's too early.
566,"00:38:22,208","00:38:24,208",I'm calling to check up on you guys.
567,"00:38:24,291","00:38:26,291","- How's Pili?
- Still annoying."
568,"00:38:26,375","00:38:29,125","- Can I talk to her?
- Let me see if she's up."
569,"00:38:33,875","00:38:35,375",Old people phones.
570,"00:38:35,458","00:38:38,166",Hello? E? You still there?
571,"00:38:38,250","00:38:40,375","Oh, no, is Pili mad at me?"
572,"00:38:40,458","00:38:44,250","Er. Yeah. No, I mean,
she's in the bathroom making a poop."
573,"00:38:44,333","00:38:46,208","Oh, she'll be a while then."
574,"00:38:46,291","00:38:47,125",You know it!
575,"00:38:47,208","00:38:49,166",That girl needs more fiber in her diet.
576,"00:38:49,250","00:38:51,583","- Can you make sure she has a banana?
- How's Papa?"
577,"00:38:51,666","00:38:55,208","He slept through the night,
but we're waiting on more tests."
578,"00:38:55,291","00:38:57,541","Uh-huh. Well, that sucks."
579,"00:38:57,625","00:39:01,458","Yeah. Well, there's a shower here, so…"
580,"00:39:01,541","00:39:05,791","if you guys could just bring me
a change of clothes, I'd appreciate it."
581,"00:39:06,458","00:39:12,458","Er. Yeah. I told Pili I was gonna take her
geocaching this morning to cheer her up,"
582,"00:39:12,541","00:39:14,083",so maybe after that.
583,"00:39:14,166","00:39:17,041","Oh, E, that's so sweet of you. Thank you!"
584,"00:39:17,125","00:39:18,333","It's all good, Mom!"
585,"00:39:18,416","00:39:22,000","Okay, have fun geocaching.
And try not to kill each other."
586,"00:39:22,916","00:39:24,958","- Call me before...
- Okay, cool. Bye."
587,"00:39:25,041","00:39:26,125",Pili!
588,"00:39:26,791","00:39:31,291","Who comes all the way to Hawaii
just to see where they film Lost?"
589,"00:39:31,375","00:39:33,291",People really liked Lost.
590,"00:39:34,041","00:39:36,541","I thought it was convoluted
and poorly plotted."
591,"00:39:36,625","00:39:39,375","I guess after six years
of accumulated emotional investment,"
592,"00:39:39,458","00:39:41,541","people don't want to admit
they spent time"
593,"00:39:41,625","00:39:44,666","on something that failed to deliver
a satisfying ending."
594,"00:39:44,750","00:39:46,791",The cinematography work was great though.
595,"00:39:46,875","00:39:48,625","Dude, got enough sunscreen?"
596,"00:39:49,208","00:39:50,833",People are so weird.
597,"00:39:50,916","00:39:53,708","This place is pretty enough
to visit on its own."
598,"00:39:57,666","00:39:59,166","Oh, balls."
599,"00:39:59,250","00:40:01,041","- Is ""balls"" a New York thing?
- Come on!"
600,"00:40:01,125","00:40:02,500","Come on, hurry up!"

602,"00:40:06,416","00:40:09,000","- Bye! Every man for himself!
- Wait! Pili!"
603,"00:40:09,625","00:40:12,541","- Pili!
- I come in peace."
604,"00:40:12,625","00:40:14,708","- I had no idea...
- Ryan! It's me, Casper."
605,"00:40:17,416","00:40:21,125","Brah. I thought you were
some trespassing haole tourists."
606,"00:40:21,208","00:40:24,208","- I was showing my friend Pili around.
- On foot?"
607,"00:40:24,916","00:40:25,916",Yeah.
608,"00:40:29,500","00:40:32,208","Why didn't you tell me
you know people who work here?"
609,"00:40:32,291","00:40:35,541","You were so excited about sneaking in.
I didn't wanna ruin your fun."
610,"00:40:35,625","00:40:38,250","- You're such a weirdo!
- Mahalo!"
611,"00:40:38,833","00:40:41,375",Onward to treasure!
612,"00:40:52,125","00:40:54,541","Yo, what's up? It's E.
Leave me a message."
613,"00:40:55,375","00:40:58,500","I know you're at Kualoa, Pili,
and when I find you, I'll kill you,"

739,"00:48:46,000","00:48:49,625","I mean, how many dead sailors
could be lying around Oahu?"
740,"00:48:49,708","00:48:50,750",Yeah.
741,"00:48:51,333","00:48:54,708","I've never found one…

747,"00:49:15,083","00:49:17,125","- E?
- Casper!"
748,"00:49:17,708","00:49:20,291",E! We're down here!
749,"00:49:20,375","00:49:21,583",The edge is slippery!
750,"00:49:21,666","00:49:23,666","- What the hell, Pili?
- Casper, you okay?"
751,"00:49:23,750","00:49:24,791","I'm okay, thanks."
752,"00:49:24,875","00:49:27,708","You know how lucky you are
you didn't die driving Kimo's truck?"
753,"00:49:28,208","00:49:31,500","Hi, Hana. Sorry about my brother.
I know he's annoying."
754,"00:49:31,583","00:49:34,541","Says the ass stuck in a cave
looking for some dumb urban legend."
755,"00:49:34,625","00:49:37,416","- It's not a legend.
- Yeah, it's real, E. Catch."
756,"00:49:43,708","00:49:46,500","- No. There's no way.
- Bite it. You'll see teeth marks."
757,"00:49:52,291","00:49:54,916","The treasure's real.
Between Papa's necklace"
758,"00:49:55,000","00:49:57,625","and that ring we found
on the skeleton here..."
759,"00:49:57,708","00:50:00,041","Wait, did... Skeleton?"
760,"00:50:00,125","00:50:03,291","- As in a dead person?
- A dead sailor."
761,"00:50:03,958","00:50:05,958",We need to get you out of there.
762,"00:50:06,041","00:50:07,875",We can use my stick. Keanu.
763,"00:50:09,375","00:50:11,041","Come on, reach!"
764,"00:50:11,125","00:50:12,958","Pili, where's my cell phone?"
765,"00:50:13,041","00:50:15,875","- Come on.
- Chill your ginormous nips. I got it."
766,"00:50:15,958","00:50:19,500","I mean, they're average nips.
They're not small or big."
767,"00:50:19,583","00:50:21,916",Give me my cell phone. I'll call 911.
768,"00:50:22,541","00:50:24,375",What did you do to my phone?
769,"00:50:25,625","00:50:29,208","It was an accident. I'll buy you a new one
with the ring we found."
770,"00:50:29,291","00:50:31,166","- I'm gonna kill you!
- Relax."
771,"00:50:31,250","00:50:33,083",Just use mine.
772,"00:50:35,750","00:50:37,291","Come on, a little more."
773,"00:50:37,375","00:50:39,541","- Come on, Casper.
- Move."
774,"00:50:39,625","00:50:41,416",I'll do it. Take your phone.
775,"00:50:46,958","00:50:47,958",Come here.
776,"00:50:51,000","00:50:52,000",All right.
777,"00:50:54,291","00:50:56,541","Jump,
you're just standing there."
778,"00:50:59,083","00:51:00,625",God. I got you.
779,"00:51:00,708","00:51:03,083",Okay.
780,"00:51:07,083","00:51:09,250","- Okay.
- Oh, hello."
781,"00:51:09,333","00:51:12,208","- Shut up and lift the kids up.
- Okay."
782,"00:51:13,166","00:51:14,166",Come on.
783,"00:51:15,000","00:51:16,000",Watch out!
784,"00:51:17,666","00:51:18,791","No, no."
785,"00:51:28,125","00:51:30,666","Yo, what's up? It's E. Leave me a message."
786,"00:51:30,750","00:51:32,666",It's Mom. I…
787,"00:51:32,750","00:51:35,958",I'm just calling to check in on you guys.
788,"00:51:36,541","00:51:38,083",Have fun geocaching.
789,"00:51:38,166","00:51:39,833","I know it's not your thing,"
790,"00:51:39,916","00:51:43,083","but it means the world to Pili
that you're doing this with her."
791,"00:51:43,166","00:51:47,500","So, tell her that I love her.
And yes, I love you too."
792,"00:51:47,583","00:51:49,166",Talk to you later. Bye!
793,"00:51:53,208","00:51:55,625",It was his ring in your mouth.
794,"00:51:55,708","00:51:58,416","Okay, according to Monks' journal..."
795,"00:51:58,500","00:51:59,500",Not this again.
796,"00:51:59,583","00:52:02,333","Monks?
Like the sailor on the Peruvian?"
797,"00:52:03,083","00:52:05,000",What? It's real.
798,"00:52:05,958","00:52:09,041","Monks and his crew
carried the treasure here."
799,"00:52:09,125","00:52:11,208",So this is where we need to go.
800,"00:52:11,291","00:52:13,750","This cave with the pools, waterfalls,"
801,"00:52:13,833","00:52:16,000","mountain hole,
and whatever those ropes are."
802,"00:52:16,083","00:52:17,791",Kinda looks like a pulley system.
803,"00:52:18,291","00:52:19,291",Let me see.
804,"00:52:24,333","00:52:27,875","So, if we just follow what it says to do
in Monks' journal,"
805,"00:52:27,958","00:52:29,916",we'll find a way out and be okay.
806,"00:52:30,708","00:52:33,666","No, no, no."
807,"00:52:33,750","00:52:37,916","You don't understand.
We'll be more than okay."
808,"00:52:38,541","00:52:39,875",We're gonna be rich!
809,"00:52:40,375","00:52:42,166",We can pay off Papa's bills…
810,"00:52:42,750","00:52:44,916",and stay in New York
811,"00:52:45,500","00:52:47,083",and get Mortimer a trainer!
812,"00:52:47,666","00:52:49,791","Hana, you could afford to go to Juilliard."
813,"00:52:50,500","00:52:54,250","Er, how about we focus on getting out?
What's next, Pili?"
814,"00:52:54,333","00:52:56,333",We just have to go through…
815,"00:52:56,958","00:53:01,125",the Las Fauces de la Muerte.
816,"00:53:01,208","00:53:04,041","Yeah. Treasure, here I come."
817,"00:53:04,541","00:53:05,875",That sounds inviting.
818,"00:53:06,916","00:53:08,541",It means the Jaws of Death.
819,"00:53:10,916","00:53:12,791",What are the odds it's metaphorical?
820,"00:53:13,291","00:53:15,083","Come on, it's fine."
821,"00:53:17,625","00:53:18,625",Really?
822,"00:53:19,166","00:53:20,958","- What?
- It's gonna be fine!"
823,"00:53:22,750","00:53:24,083",This is sick!
824,"00:53:25,041","00:53:28,416","No, no, no."
825,"00:53:28,500","00:53:30,541",This is really bad.
826,"00:53:30,625","00:53:31,875",Not metaphorical.
827,"00:53:34,458","00:53:38,000","Stalactites are very sharp.
How will we protect ourselves?"
828,"00:53:38,875","00:53:39,916",I've got an idea.

855,"00:55:27,500","00:55:28,750",Leilani.

860,"00:55:49,458","00:55:52,083",Yeah. She left after Kua died.
861,"00:56:01,416","00:56:05,333","Well, visiting must make you miss home."
862,"00:56:05,416","00:56:08,541","Yeah,
actually I was thinking of moving back."
863,"00:56:09,125","00:56:11,166","Oh, that's good news, right, Kimo?"
864,"00:56:12,375","00:56:13,875",Now why would you do that?
865,"00:56:16,291","00:56:18,500",To spend more time with you.
866,"00:56:18,583","00:56:20,958","I mean, you're ohana, right?"
867,"00:56:21,041","00:56:23,291",And what would you know about ohana?

873,"00:57:05,750","00:57:08,083",I just need to clarify something.
874,"00:57:13,875","00:57:15,291",Er...
875,"00:57:15,375","00:57:18,541","Guys, don't touch the wood."
876,"00:57:20,958","00:57:21,958","Oh, God."
877,"00:57:22,000","00:57:23,541","All right, let's go."
878,"00:57:29,416","00:57:31,958","- Get your butt out of my face!
- Your face is in my butt!"
879,"00:57:32,041","00:57:33,958","Get your face out of his butt, E!"
880,"00:57:34,041","00:57:36,583","- Just move, I'll get your bag.
- All right."
881,"00:57:37,291","00:57:39,458","And if you fart, I'm gonna kill you."
882,"00:57:39,541","00:57:42,333","- I'm too big for this.
- We're almost there!"
883,"00:57:49,708","00:57:50,958",Ugh!
884,"00:58:00,750","00:58:03,000","- What's wrong?
- Your bag is caught on something."
885,"00:58:05,541","00:58:06,625","Oh, hey, look!"
886,"00:58:11,583","00:58:14,958","Spider scream. E, are you okay?"
887,"00:58:15,041","00:58:17,083",That sound was your brother?
888,"00:58:17,166","00:58:20,500","Don't worry,
wolf spiders are harmless and cute."
889,"00:58:20,583","00:58:23,541","We're lucky that it wasn't
a brown violin spider,"
890,"00:58:23,625","00:58:26,708","because, hoo boy, let me tell you..."
891,"00:58:26,791","00:58:28,125",I'll need you to kill it.
892,"00:58:29,500","00:58:31,500",But the wolf spider is endangered!
893,"00:58:31,583","00:58:32,750",I'm endangered!
894,"00:58:36,708","00:58:37,708",Ioane…
895,"00:58:40,083","00:58:42,791",don't… move.
896,"00:58:48,416","00:58:50,916",That is not a cute wolf spider.
897,"00:58:51,500","00:58:55,750",That… is not… a wolf spider.
898,"00:58:56,333","00:58:58,166",Why does it have so many eyes?
899,"00:58:58,666","00:59:01,541",Those… aren't… eyes.
900,"00:59:04,791","00:59:08,500",Go! Get out!
901,"00:59:08,583","00:59:09,666",Move!
902,"00:59:09,750","00:59:11,125",Go!
903,"00:59:11,208","00:59:12,416",Move!
904,"00:59:28,583","00:59:30,375",Where's Casper's backpack?
905,"00:59:32,500","00:59:35,166","- The journal's in Casper's backpack!
- Pili!"
906,"00:59:46,958","00:59:47,958",The photo.
907,"00:59:55,458","00:59:59,791","Pili, please tell me you remember
what the journal said about getting out."
908,"01:00:01,500","01:00:03,291","You finished reading it, right?"
909,"01:00:03,791","01:00:06,041","Did you just ask her
if she finished reading it?"
910,"01:00:06,541","01:00:09,583","Yeah, I did, obviously."
911,"01:00:11,583","01:00:12,666",Okay.
912,"01:00:13,500","01:00:14,916",Then what did it say?
913,"01:00:17,125","01:00:18,416",I remember.
914,"01:00:18,500","01:00:21,166",So Robinson and Brown came into the cave
915,"01:00:21,250","01:00:25,000","""Dude, it's raining so hard."""
916,"01:00:25,083","01:00:29,375","""Just moist and muddy and...
Yeah, and, uh, like... Woo!"""
917,"01:00:29,458","01:00:32,375","""It stank like ammonia.""
""Because of all the bat poop."""
918,"01:00:32,458","01:00:34,666","""Yeah. Mad bat poop."""
919,"01:00:35,875","01:00:38,041","I remember now. Because you fell asleep,"
920,"01:00:38,125","01:00:40,416","I took the journal,
I read the whole thing."
921,"01:00:40,500","01:00:43,208",Robinson and Brown were talking about it:
922,"01:00:43,291","01:00:46,666","""It's raining outside.""
""It's moist and muddy."" ""Yeah, moist."""
923,"01:00:46,750","01:00:51,291","""Hey, yo, let's all go to Papaya King
and get a slice."" ""Woo!"" ""Yeah!"""
924,"01:00:51,833","01:00:55,208","And then they all lived
happily ever after."
925,"01:00:55,291","01:00:57,333",They don't have pizza at Papaya King.
926,"01:00:57,416","01:01:01,083","That's exactly my point.
You didn't finish reading the journal."
927,"01:01:01,916","01:01:03,666",I'm a slow reader.
928,"01:01:03,750","01:01:07,416","- ""Don't worry,"" she said. ""We'll be fine.""
- I was just trying to help Papa."
929,"01:01:07,500","01:01:08,541","No, you weren't!"
930,"01:01:08,625","01:01:10,583","You were pretending to be
a treasure hunter."
931,"01:01:10,666","01:01:14,208","You do this all the time, and this time
you dragged us down with you."
932,"01:01:19,125","01:01:20,125",Get over here.
933,"01:01:20,916","01:01:22,291",What is wrong with you?
934,"01:01:22,375","01:01:25,208","- Me? How are you not freaking out?
- I am!"
935,"01:01:26,208","01:01:28,750",I am freaking out so hard right now.
936,"01:01:28,833","01:01:30,500","- But you don't see it.
- You okay?"
937,"01:01:30,583","01:01:34,583","Because I don't want them to see it,
because they're 12."
938,"01:01:40,583","01:01:42,125","Here, take this."
939,"01:01:43,916","01:01:45,791",It's not me you need to make right by.
940,"01:01:48,000","01:01:49,666",Your stupid head's bleeding.
941,"01:01:51,250","01:01:53,583","Kids, come on."
942,"01:02:14,083","01:02:15,083",Hey.
943,"01:02:16,583","01:02:17,583",Thank you.
944,"01:02:18,875","01:02:20,125",Sorry about earlier.
945,"01:02:23,000","01:02:26,208","It's okay.
It's just that things have been..."
946,"01:02:27,625","01:02:28,625",Stressful?
947,"01:02:32,875","01:02:34,333",Overwhelmingly.
948,"01:02:35,041","01:02:37,708",I know we haven't really talked since…
949,"01:02:39,541","01:02:41,208","well, since high school."
950,"01:02:42,583","01:02:46,083","But trust me,
Kimo's happy you're back home."
951,"01:02:47,541","01:02:48,791",I don't think so.
952,"01:02:49,958","01:02:50,958",Leilani…
953,"01:02:52,333","01:02:53,875",it's been 11 years.
954,"01:02:55,208","01:02:56,875",He doesn't want you to leave.
955,"01:02:57,541","01:02:58,958",He's just...
956,"01:02:59,666","01:03:02,250","He doesn't know how to show you
how much he miss you."
957,"01:03:11,875","01:03:12,875","Wow, Pili,"
958,"01:03:12,916","01:03:16,500","you were right.
Monks left these markers everywhere."
959,"01:03:17,666","01:03:20,625","Look, there's another one.
Good job finding those."
960,"01:03:20,708","01:03:22,666","- Hana, look!
- Casp, hold on."
961,"01:03:25,375","01:03:26,375",Hey.
962,"01:03:27,916","01:03:30,458",I saw you had a picture of Mom and Dad.
963,"01:03:32,541","01:03:33,750",Can I see it?
964,"01:03:48,875","01:03:53,166","- I've never seen this before.
- Yeah, I found it in Mom's room."
965,"01:03:56,083","01:03:57,833",Mom's dress is really pretty.
966,"01:03:59,416","01:04:00,416",I know.
967,"01:04:01,125","01:04:04,166","Do you think that was the last time
she shaved her legs?"
968,"01:04:06,833","01:04:08,625","Oh, my God."
969,"01:04:08,708","01:04:10,291","Oh, no."
970,"01:04:11,500","01:04:14,250","- They both look so happy.
- Dad looks good."
971,"01:04:15,000","01:04:17,125",Same crew cut as I remember.
972,"01:04:19,333","01:04:21,000",You're lucky you remember anything.
973,"01:04:53,041","01:04:54,500",I'm sorry.
974,"01:04:56,541","01:04:57,583",I sorry.
975,"01:04:58,166","01:05:00,791",I sorry for making you feel unwanted…
976,"01:05:01,958","01:05:03,166",and a burden.
977,"01:05:07,875","01:05:09,833",Let's make things right.
978,"01:05:11,708","01:05:13,875","Yes,
let's make things right."
979,"01:05:20,041","01:05:22,125",How can I teach your kids aloha
980,"01:05:22,208","01:05:25,125","if I don't have my relationship
with you right first?"
981,"01:05:25,625","01:05:27,583",I want to make it r ight
982,"01:05:29,166","01:05:30,708",E kala mai ia'u.
983,"01:05:32,833","01:05:34,500",I sorry I blame you…
984,"01:05:35,791","01:05:37,250",for my loneliness.
985,"01:05:38,375","01:05:40,041",E kala mai ia'u…
986,"01:05:41,125","01:05:42,500",for leaving you…
987,"01:05:44,166","01:05:46,666",and for staying away for so long.
988,"01:05:47,291","01:05:50,708","I had to stay on the island
'cause it was my responsibility."
989,"01:05:50,791","01:05:54,958",But I should have been there for you.
990,"01:05:55,041","01:05:58,041",E kala mai ia'u
991,"01:05:58,125","01:06:00,166",for causing you so much pain…
992,"01:06:02,166","01:06:05,375","because I was running away
from my own pain."
993,"01:06:05,458","01:06:06,750",Thank you.
994,"01:06:08,333","01:06:10,375",For coming to take care of me…
995,"01:06:11,291","01:06:13,541",when I told you not for come.
996,"01:06:14,125","01:06:16,125",Thank you for your love.
997,"01:06:18,500","01:06:21,208",Even after I hurt you so deeply.
998,"01:06:22,041","01:06:23,041",I love you.
999,"01:06:23,458","01:06:25,791","I love you so much, Papa."
1000,"01:06:38,000","01:06:39,000",What the…
1001,"01:06:47,666","01:06:50,208",Is the floor literally lava?
1002,"01:06:52,541","01:06:53,375",Peanuts!
1003,"01:06:59,958","01:07:01,666","Yo, what are you doing, Hana?"
1004,"01:07:02,166","01:07:04,208",Er... I'll be right there!
1005,"01:07:05,166","01:07:07,125",Hana's not a big fan of heights.
1006,"01:07:09,000","01:07:11,416",Then how is she gonna cross that?
1007,"01:07:14,583","01:07:17,708","You know, Hana,
we're probably not that high up."
1008,"01:07:18,333","01:07:21,541","It's not that deep. Me and Casper
will cross the bridge first."
1009,"01:07:21,625","01:07:24,458","What? No, you're not test running
this deathtrap."
1010,"01:07:24,541","01:07:27,583","- Let's not call it that.
- We're the lightest out of you two,"
1011,"01:07:27,666","01:07:30,125","If anyone should test it, it should be us!"
1012,"01:07:30,833","01:07:35,500","It's true. You have a lot of muscles
and muscle is heavy."
1013,"01:07:37,000","01:07:40,875","- I do have a lot of muscles now that...
- Really? Now?"
1014,"01:07:40,958","01:07:45,250","- What are you guys talking about?
- Nothing. It'll be fine."
1015,"01:07:45,333","01:07:46,708",Watch.
1016,"01:07:59,791","01:08:00,916",There it goes.
1017,"01:08:02,208","01:08:03,625",Maybe there's some rope here.
1018,"01:08:04,541","01:08:06,375",Dirtiest pirates I've ever met.
1019,"01:08:09,000","01:08:10,666","You tidying up, Marie Kondo?"
1020,"01:08:12,916","01:08:13,958",I love her.
1021,"01:08:14,041","01:08:17,291","- How did these guys die?
- If I had the journal, I could tell you."
1022,"01:08:17,375","01:08:20,000","I'd also know
how that Monks dude got across the pit"
1023,"01:08:20,083","01:08:23,500","without building a bridge
and then built a bridge, but I don't."
1024,"01:08:27,458","01:08:29,000",Does that look like a bullet hole?
1025,"01:08:38,000","01:08:39,250","- What's wrong?
- Nothing."
1026,"01:08:41,625","01:08:44,125","Hey, you guys! You gotta see this!"
1027,"01:08:49,458","01:08:51,125",Look! Over here!
1028,"01:08:51,208","01:08:53,625","- We found the way across!
- How?"
1029,"01:08:54,208","01:08:56,750","Just follow the ledge
and jump across here."
1030,"01:08:58,041","01:08:59,333","You ready, Keanu?"
1031,"01:08:59,416","01:09:01,500",Woo!
1032,"01:09:01,583","01:09:03,875","- Oh, what are you...
- Tada!"
1033,"01:09:06,750","01:09:08,958","- I hate it.
- It's the only way!"
1034,"01:09:09,041","01:09:10,833","- You can do it!
- You got this!"
1035,"01:09:13,916","01:09:15,083",Fine.
1036,"01:09:16,541","01:09:18,875",I'll just… get this over with.
1037,"01:09:20,291","01:09:23,041","Yeah, this isn't a big deal at all."
1038,"01:09:23,125","01:09:24,708",This is nothing.
1039,"01:09:24,791","01:09:27,000","Thinking about it,
the Empire State's probably"
1040,"01:09:27,083","01:09:29,125","two, or three, or four,
or five, maybe six..."
1041,"01:09:29,208","01:09:30,958",Sssh!
1042,"01:09:31,041","01:09:33,416",Just stop… talking.
1043,"01:09:34,666","01:09:35,666",Okay.
1044,"01:09:36,916","01:09:38,083",Not a big deal.
1045,"01:09:39,541","01:09:42,208","The more you think about, it's really..."
1046,"01:09:46,875","01:09:50,250","- Okay. No, I can't do this.
- You can, you gotta keep..."
1047,"01:09:50,333","01:09:53,875","Don't tell me what I can
and can't do. You almost fell."
1048,"01:09:55,750","01:09:58,125","Hana,
you just gotta get your mind off it all."
1049,"01:09:58,791","01:09:59,791",How?

1080,"01:12:13,291","01:12:16,166","Er. Yeah, I just have to pee."
1081,"01:12:18,000","01:12:20,125","- You look like you have to pee.
- I don't."
1082,"01:12:20,208","01:12:22,041","- You look like you have to pee.
- What?"
1083,"01:12:23,125","01:12:25,000","- What's going on?
- I don't know."
1084,"01:12:26,500","01:12:27,583","Okay, stop."
1085,"01:12:28,250","01:12:31,083","Earlier you said something
about some wack spiders..."
1086,"01:12:31,166","01:12:32,958",You said we gotta go pee. I have to.
1087,"01:12:33,500","01:12:35,500","Dude, I need you to focus. Spiders."
1088,"01:12:35,583","01:12:37,541",You said something about one that's brown.
1089,"01:12:38,041","01:12:41,333","The brown violin.
The most dangerous spider in Hawaii."
1090,"01:12:42,000","01:12:44,708","- Most dangerous. Great.
- A cousin of the brown recluse."
1091,"01:12:44,791","01:12:48,000","Their venom's necrotic.
We are so lucky that we were not bitten."
1092,"01:12:49,041","01:12:51,750","Let's say one of us was bitten.
How messed up would that be?"
1093,"01:12:51,833","01:12:54,750","It depends on whether or not
the bite blisters."
1094,"01:12:54,833","01:12:55,916",Like this?
1095,"01:12:59,333","01:13:01,458","Oh, that's not… great."
1096,"01:13:01,541","01:13:04,708","- Should I pop it?
- No! We have to get you to a hospital."
1097,"01:13:04,791","01:13:07,416","- What's gonna happen?
- Next would be fever and chills."
1098,"01:13:07,500","01:13:10,833","If the bite weeps pus and the skin
turns purple, it's gone necrotic."
1099,"01:13:10,916","01:13:12,250",My dad's friend got bitten
1100,"01:13:12,333","01:13:15,708","and the doctor had to scoop
the necrotized flesh from his leg."
1101,"01:13:15,791","01:13:18,291","- I need you to shut up.
- We gotta tell Pili and Hana."
1102,"01:13:18,375","01:13:21,791","We have to get out, and it'll be hard
if everybody's worried about me."
1103,"01:13:22,416","01:13:24,583","- Is that duct tape?
- Yeah."
1104,"01:13:25,833","01:13:27,416",I'm not sure that's sanitary.
1105,"01:13:27,500","01:13:28,625",Just shut up and pee.
1106,"01:13:34,541","01:13:36,000",Woah.
1107,"01:13:38,750","01:13:39,791",Cool.
1108,"01:13:39,875","01:13:40,875","Oh, wow!"
1109,"01:13:41,541","01:13:42,875",Jeez!
1110,"01:13:46,833","01:13:47,833",Wow!
1111,"01:13:48,833","01:13:50,500",Why is it glowing in here?
1112,"01:13:51,041","01:13:52,458",Dinoflagellates.
1113,"01:13:53,458","01:13:56,750","- What?
- They're like a bioluminescent algae."
1114,"01:13:56,833","01:13:59,583",But I've never heard of…
1115,"01:14:00,333","01:14:03,833","bioluminescent organisms
living in fresh water."
1116,"01:14:05,750","01:14:07,250",What's up with your hand?
1117,"01:14:08,541","01:14:10,041","I don't wanna be that guy,"
1118,"01:14:10,125","01:14:12,541","but does anybody see a way out?
'Cause I don't."
1119,"01:14:19,083","01:14:22,875","These grooves look like
they go straight to the bottom."
1120,"01:14:24,416","01:14:28,541","""Straight to the bottom
and there you'll find..."""
1121,"01:14:30,208","01:14:32,750",This isn't a pool. It's a tunnel!
1122,"01:14:32,833","01:14:35,541","We can't see it
because it's filled with rain water!"
1123,"01:14:35,625","01:14:37,083",I'll dive in and check.
1124,"01:14:37,666","01:14:39,083","- Are you sure?
- Yeah."
1125,"01:14:43,875","01:14:46,125",Okay.
1126,"01:14:46,208","01:14:48,083","Cold! Ah, my bits!"
1127,"01:14:55,250","01:14:56,250",Casper?
1128,"01:14:57,041","01:14:58,041",Casper!
1129,"01:14:58,083","01:14:59,083",Hold this!
1130,"01:15:01,166","01:15:03,416",I found it.
1131,"01:15:03,500","01:15:05,583",The tunnel is shaped like a U-bend.
1132,"01:15:05,666","01:15:07,875","Hold your breath
and get to the other side."
1133,"01:15:07,958","01:15:09,125",And I saw sunlight!
1134,"01:15:09,208","01:15:10,458","- Really?
- Yeah."
1135,"01:15:10,541","01:15:11,708","Come on, Hana!"
1136,"01:15:18,208","01:15:20,000","- You had me so worried.
- Sorry."
1137,"01:15:20,083","01:15:22,083","- You okay?
- Yeah."
1138,"01:15:22,166","01:15:23,000",Good.
1139,"01:15:23,083","01:15:26,208","They're better to each other
than we are, aren't they?"
1140,"01:15:27,166","01:15:30,958","- Guys, the tunnel's right here!
- Go ahead. We'll meet you there."
1141,"01:15:33,875","01:15:34,875",Hey.
1142,"01:15:37,291","01:15:40,958","I know you're scared, but…
I'll be right here the whole time."
1143,"01:15:41,708","01:15:42,708",Come on.
1144,"01:15:46,375","01:15:47,833",Just one second.
1145,"01:15:47,916","01:15:51,541","You can do this! You got this!
You can do it... No, you can't."
1146,"01:15:51,625","01:15:55,750","- Monks' treasure's over there. Let's go.
- I got it. Okay."
1147,"01:15:55,833","01:15:58,625","- I got it.
- Pili, come here. I got you."
1148,"01:15:58,708","01:16:01,166","You're not acting like you got it.
Get on my back."
1149,"01:16:01,250","01:16:03,541","- I got it!
- This is for Papa."
1150,"01:16:03,625","01:16:05,375","- Okay.
- Okay, there you go."
1151,"01:16:05,458","01:16:08,083","Hold your breath. Ready? One, two, three."
1152,"01:16:18,041","01:16:19,125",Go!
1153,"01:16:37,000","01:16:39,500","Pili! Get on my back, let's go!"
1154,"01:16:40,541","01:16:43,041","Pili, are you all right?"
1155,"01:16:46,000","01:16:48,458","- Are you okay?
- Yeah."
1156,"01:16:48,541","01:16:50,666","- Pili, are you sure?
- I'm good."
1157,"01:16:56,208","01:16:57,875","Okay. Well, then let's go."
1158,"01:17:00,500","01:17:03,500",Hey! Who said you can't swim?
1159,"01:17:16,958","01:17:20,125","Wait a minute.
I remember this cave!"
1160,"01:17:20,208","01:17:22,916","The one with the mountain hole
and crown-shaped opening!"
1161,"01:17:23,666","01:17:26,041","It's the same one
Monks drew in the journal!"
1162,"01:17:26,500","01:17:28,500",This is ground zero!
1163,"01:17:28,583","01:17:31,583","- Yeah!
- Yeah!"
1164,"01:17:31,666","01:17:33,750","- Let's go!
- We made it!"
1165,"01:17:34,375","01:17:36,958",Watch your step.
1166,"01:17:37,041","01:17:39,291",Look at all these waterfalls!
1167,"01:17:39,375","01:17:41,541","It's been here all along!
I knew it!"
1168,"01:17:41,625","01:17:43,375","Guys, I can see outside!"
1169,"01:17:43,916","01:17:45,333",We're almost there!
1170,"01:18:00,083","01:18:01,583",Er...
1171,"01:18:01,666","01:18:03,083",Balls!
1172,"01:18:05,875","01:18:07,208",Sounds weird when I say it.
1173,"01:18:10,416","01:18:12,875","Sorry, guys,
I gotta go check on something."
1174,"01:18:12,958","01:18:15,333","- What is she doing?
- Ground zero."
1175,"01:18:15,416","01:18:17,583","The Geocache Queen
looking for her treasure."
1176,"01:18:18,500","01:18:21,625","- Hana! Reception! You're outside.
- Oh, my God."
1177,"01:18:23,375","01:18:25,083",Come on! Come on!
1178,"01:18:30,666","01:18:31,666",Go.
1179,"01:18:34,000","01:18:37,166","- E, you look terrible.
- Thank you."
1180,"01:18:39,250","01:18:43,333","Er, I'm gonna go check on Pili.
If you wanna hold Keanu for me..."
1181,"01:18:43,416","01:18:44,875",Yes. Thank you.
1182,"01:18:50,000","01:18:52,750",I swear it's in here somewhere.
1183,"01:18:53,708","01:18:55,583",I just have to see it.
1184,"01:18:57,125","01:19:00,375",No reception and only 3% battery.
1185,"01:19:06,375","01:19:07,375",Are you okay?
1186,"01:19:08,666","01:19:09,541",Yeah.
1187,"01:19:09,625","01:19:11,500",I just needed a minute.
1188,"01:19:15,125","01:19:17,125","- Are you sure?
- Yeah."
1189,"01:19:21,125","01:19:24,708","You know, if Pili finds anything,"
1190,"01:19:25,458","01:19:27,666","you better mail
that application into Julliard."
1191,"01:19:30,166","01:19:32,000",Why do you even care so much?
1192,"01:19:33,333","01:19:35,791",How many jobs do you work? Two?
1193,"01:19:36,833","01:19:38,166",I work at Shake Shack.
1194,"01:19:38,708","01:19:41,875","I know the smell of a fast food
employee's shirt when I fold one."
1195,"01:19:44,208","01:19:47,416",It's not just about the money.
1196,"01:19:50,250","01:19:52,541","Hawaii's a big part of me,"
1197,"01:19:53,666","01:19:56,416",and I don't know if it's worth leaving
1198,"01:19:56,500","01:19:59,291",just for a shot at singing.
1199,"01:19:59,375","01:20:01,958",So you're just scared of being homesick?
1200,"01:20:02,041","01:20:07,375","I'm scared of New York making me
uncomfortable with who I am."
1201,"01:20:11,750","01:20:13,375",Remember Monks' drawing
1202,"01:20:13,458","01:20:16,833","and all those weird ropes
attached to the poles and stuff?"
1203,"01:20:17,625","01:20:20,916","Yeah, that ladder was access
to the big bag of rocks,"
1204,"01:20:21,000","01:20:22,625",but where is it?
1205,"01:20:23,416","01:20:26,291","- Do you think we can climb up and find it?
- No."
1206,"01:20:27,041","01:20:28,958","- Hold this!
- Where are you going?"
1207,"01:20:29,041","01:20:31,875","The pulley's buried
under 200 years of banyan roots."
1208,"01:20:32,291","01:20:33,875",So let's pull them down.
1209,"01:20:38,708","01:20:42,041","Is it weird that
I'm getting used to finding dead sailors?"
1210,"01:20:42,125","01:20:44,500","Or that so many of them
died along the way,"
1211,"01:20:44,583","01:20:46,916",maybe not all accidentally.
1212,"01:20:47,000","01:20:49,625","One of the guys
must have turned on the crew."
1213,"01:20:50,541","01:20:52,958",What if it was Robinson or Brown?
1214,"01:20:53,833","01:20:55,833","- What?
- Think about it."
1215,"01:20:56,500","01:20:59,750","They told Monks
the captain was gonna kill them"
1216,"01:20:59,833","01:21:01,541",and take all of the gold.
1217,"01:21:04,541","01:21:06,166",But what if they were lying?
1218,"01:21:09,416","01:21:11,125",What if that was their plan?
1219,"01:21:11,208","01:21:12,791","So, Robinson was all:"
1220,"01:21:12,875","01:21:16,208","""Thanks for carrying the gold and stuff,
'cause it was so heavy."""
1221,"01:21:16,291","01:21:18,750","""Too bad you gotta… die now!"""
1222,"01:21:22,875","01:21:24,458",That would have been messed up!
1223,"01:21:24,541","01:21:26,750","Monks and the crew
never stood a chance."
1224,"01:21:31,833","01:21:33,375","""No one hurt badly, I hope."""
1225,"01:21:33,458","01:21:35,666","""I'm gonna be moving over there."""
1226,"01:21:35,750","01:21:38,208","""You guys stay here.
I'll be back to kill you."""
1227,"01:21:39,958","01:21:43,583","Then, how did Monks make it
to the beach all beat up"
1228,"01:21:43,666","01:21:45,041",and give the journal to my family?
1229,"01:21:45,125","01:21:46,583",Maybe he was in on it.
1230,"01:21:46,666","01:21:50,625","""I can be a villain with you.
You can train me. I can do whatever."""
1231,"01:21:50,708","01:21:54,291","""Help me help you do
villainy stuff or whatever."""
1232,"01:21:54,375","01:21:56,458","""Come on, what would you say?"""
1233,"01:22:00,708","01:22:01,916",And they turned him.
1234,"01:22:03,791","01:22:05,083",No way.
1235,"01:22:06,583","01:22:09,625","And then Robinson, Brown,
and Monks took down the men."
1236,"01:22:10,916","01:22:13,708","Wait, wait, wait."
1237,"01:22:13,791","01:22:16,000",Monks would never turn on his friends.
1238,"01:22:16,083","01:22:17,500","Well, someone did."
1239,"01:22:18,000","01:22:21,333","I know these roots are hiding something.
Come on, let's pull them down."
1240,"01:22:34,083","01:22:36,541","Winner, winner, treasure dinner!"
1241,"01:22:45,666","01:22:46,958",Something's missing.
1242,"01:22:48,291","01:22:51,583","Hey, Casper,
weren't there three bags of rocks?"
1243,"01:22:51,666","01:22:53,958","- Counterweights!
- My bad."
1244,"01:22:54,041","01:22:57,166","Weren't there three counterweights
in the drawing?"
1245,"01:22:57,250","01:23:00,625","Yeah. That one was lower,
that was higher,"
1246,"01:23:01,791","01:23:04,125","and the third one was low too,
but where is it?"
1247,"01:23:06,458","01:23:08,625","Oh, look, here it is."
1248,"01:23:08,708","01:23:10,708",Look! Someone must have cut it!
1249,"01:23:11,375","01:23:14,500","Yeah! If we pull it down
and get it into the right position,"
1250,"01:23:14,583","01:23:16,791",it should lead to Monks' treasure.
1251,"01:23:18,541","01:23:21,000","Don't worry, Pili, I can do this."
1252,"01:23:21,083","01:23:23,875","Come on, Casper!
You can do this! You got this!"
1253,"01:23:26,541","01:23:28,666","Oh, man!"
1254,"01:23:29,500","01:23:31,875","- Casper! What are you doing?
- I'm okay."
1255,"01:23:31,958","01:23:34,500","If we pull this down,
it'll show us the way!"
1256,"01:23:35,166","01:23:37,041",We need more muscle!
1257,"01:23:38,458","01:23:40,125",I know someone who's got muscle.
1258,"01:23:46,166","01:23:47,375","Just so you know,"
1259,"01:23:47,875","01:23:50,333","if you let go,
I'm not responsible for your death."
1260,"01:23:50,875","01:23:53,083",It's okay. We can still be friends.
1261,"01:23:53,166","01:23:54,916",Hurry! We're losing light!
1262,"01:23:55,000","01:23:56,000","- You ready?
- Yeah."
1263,"01:23:56,083","01:23:58,500","One, two, three!"
1264,"01:24:05,291","01:24:07,708","Come on!
You're strong! You can do this!"
1265,"01:24:07,791","01:24:09,666","- Keep pulling, Hana!
- Don't let go!"
1266,"01:24:09,750","01:24:11,750","- I'm trying!
- You got this!"
1267,"01:24:11,833","01:24:13,583","- Hana, pull!
- Yes!"
1268,"01:24:13,666","01:24:16,208","- Keep pulling!
- You got this! I believe!"
1269,"01:24:16,291","01:24:17,613","- Let's go!
- It's working."
1270,"01:24:17,625","01:24:18,958",Come on!
1271,"01:24:19,041","01:24:21,916","- It's working!
- Come on!"
1272,"01:24:23,083","01:24:24,583","Come on, Ginger Stark!"
1273,"01:24:26,666","01:24:29,333","Come on, E! We need to find
a way to tie this thing off!"
1274,"01:24:30,916","01:24:33,208",The rope's too old! It's gonna snap!
1275,"01:24:33,291","01:24:35,875","Well, if the rope snaps,
then we won't be able to..."
1276,"01:24:36,958","01:24:38,166","- I'm okay.
- You okay?"
1277,"01:24:38,250","01:24:39,541",Yeah. So are my pants.
1278,"01:24:40,958","01:24:41,958",Widowmaker!
1279,"01:24:44,375","01:24:47,666","If the rope comes out of the block,
the pull will be too strong for us!"
1280,"01:24:47,750","01:24:49,166",Hold on! I got it!
1281,"01:24:50,250","01:24:52,000","Hurry up, Pili, faster!"
1282,"01:24:52,083","01:24:53,500","- Go, Pils!
- Go!"
1283,"01:24:56,833","01:24:58,958","Hold on, guys, almost there!"
1284,"01:24:59,625","01:25:00,625",I got...
1285,"01:25:00,958","01:25:01,833",Pili!
1286,"01:25:01,916","01:25:02,916",Pili!
1287,"01:25:06,666","01:25:07,666",I'm good.
1288,"01:25:07,708","01:25:09,083","Hurry, Pili!"
1289,"01:25:09,166","01:25:10,041","Come on, Pili!"
1290,"01:25:10,125","01:25:12,458","Come on, Keanu! Hang in there!"
1291,"01:25:12,541","01:25:13,708",Hold it!
1292,"01:25:16,291","01:25:17,750","- Come on!
- Hurry!"
1293,"01:25:18,333","01:25:19,541","Pili, hurry!"
1294,"01:25:19,625","01:25:21,625",I have a confession!
1295,"01:25:21,708","01:25:25,416","I'm not as strong as I look!
I only went to one Crossfit class."
1296,"01:25:25,500","01:25:29,125","It was a free trial! I'm so sorry!
I'm so sorry!"
1297,"01:25:29,208","01:25:30,250","- Shut up!
- Shut up!"
1298,"01:25:30,333","01:25:31,791","Hang in there, guys!"
1299,"01:25:33,208","01:25:34,458",Please hurry!
1300,"01:25:35,625","01:25:38,750","Don't let go! Hold on, E!
I can't hold on much longer!"
1301,"01:25:40,791","01:25:42,458",PILI
1302,"01:25:43,166","01:25:46,250",Guys! Something's happening!
1303,"01:25:46,333","01:25:48,500",Yeah! Ow!
1304,"01:25:48,583","01:25:50,208",Don't let go!
1305,"01:25:52,458","01:25:53,875",You guys can let go now.
1306,"01:25:54,916","01:25:56,375","- Sure?
- Is it safe?"
1307,"01:25:56,458","01:25:57,750","Yeah, it's safe!"
1308,"01:25:59,208","01:26:00,958","Look, something's happening!"
1309,"01:26:09,416","01:26:11,791","Look! That must be the way
to Monks' treasure!"
1310,"01:26:11,875","01:26:13,750","- We did it!
- Yeah!"
1311,"01:26:18,750","01:26:20,291","- Boom! Yes!
- Yes!"
1312,"01:26:22,500","01:26:24,583","- We did it!
- We're losing daylight."
1313,"01:26:24,666","01:26:25,791",Let's go!
1314,"01:26:35,708","01:26:36,916",Watch your step.
1315,"01:26:37,541","01:26:39,291",No… way.
1316,"01:26:41,500","01:26:43,625",I told you it would be here.
1317,"01:26:43,708","01:26:46,375",I knew it! I knew it!
1318,"01:26:49,625","01:26:51,208",I knew it the whole time!
1319,"01:26:51,833","01:26:53,833",Woohoo!
1320,"01:26:59,291","01:27:00,291",Sick!
1321,"01:27:00,375","01:27:02,791",Cheese on rice!
1322,"01:27:06,500","01:27:08,333",Woo!
1323,"01:27:08,416","01:27:10,416","- Ow!
- Sorry."
1324,"01:27:28,666","01:27:29,875",No way.
1325,"01:27:33,250","01:27:36,250","Not bad for a stupid
fake treasure hunt, huh?"
1326,"01:27:37,208","01:27:38,208",Yeah.
1327,"01:27:39,458","01:27:40,583",Hm!
1328,"01:27:51,041","01:27:55,000","- You're right.
- I know!"
1329,"01:27:55,083","01:27:57,000","Yeah, baby! We're rich!"
1330,"01:27:59,791","01:28:02,458","- Ow!
- What? You did it to him?"
1331,"01:28:02,541","01:28:05,916","We had those trade winds for a few days,
but you can say A hui hou to that,"
1332,"01:28:06,000","01:28:07,958",because we won't see them for the next…
1333,"01:28:08,041","01:28:10,125","Yo, what's up? It's E.
Leave me a message."
1334,"01:28:10,625","01:28:14,875","E, I'm doing that thing where I'm going
from being worried to being mad."
1335,"01:28:14,958","01:28:16,125","Seriously, call me."
1336,"01:28:16,208","01:28:17,333","So as we go,"
1337,"01:28:17,416","01:28:20,625","up until at least tomorrow
we're going to be seeing…"
1338,"01:28:20,708","01:28:22,625",Kualoa Ranch?
1339,"01:28:23,958","01:28:27,125","This doesn't make sense.
Kualoa should be closed by now."
1340,"01:28:27,208","01:28:30,208",And why is E's location hours old?
1341,"01:28:30,291","01:28:33,458","Did he turn off his phone?
I'm gonna kill those kids."
1342,"01:28:34,041","01:28:36,250","- Leilani.
- I know, they're just teenagers."
1343,"01:28:36,333","01:28:39,750","- They could have texted or something.
- Leilani!"
1344,"01:28:43,000","01:28:45,875","Pili got some bling bling, yo!"
1345,"01:28:45,958","01:28:49,166","I cannot believe that Robinson, Brown,
and Monks' torches still work."
1346,"01:28:50,166","01:28:53,083","- How are your matches not wet?
- Got a waterproof case."
1347,"01:28:53,166","01:28:54,416",Nice.
1348,"01:28:55,583","01:28:56,500",Dope or trash?
1349,"01:28:58,375","01:29:00,958",Keep it. Keep all of it.
1350,"01:29:02,333","01:29:04,083","- Ow!
- I got you."
1351,"01:29:04,166","01:29:05,291",I think it's stuck.
1352,"01:29:06,291","01:29:08,958","Okay. All right. Okay, and…"
1353,"01:29:10,375","01:29:12,083","This belongs to me now, right?"
1354,"01:29:12,875","01:29:14,791",No. Mine.
1355,"01:29:21,625","01:29:23,000",You know what we should do?
1356,"01:29:24,125","01:29:25,125",What?
1357,"01:29:29,500","01:29:30,625",Selfie!
1358,"01:29:33,500","01:29:34,750",Okay. Ready?
1359,"01:29:35,416","01:29:37,375","On three. One, two..."
1360,"01:29:39,208","01:29:42,000","Didn't that go under with you?
How is it still working?"
1361,"01:29:42,083","01:29:44,041","Waterproof case, mainlander."
1362,"01:29:44,125","01:29:45,333",Get with it.
1363,"01:29:46,000","01:29:47,625","Guys, come here."
1364,"01:29:50,500","01:29:51,500",Ready?
1365,"01:29:52,750","01:29:55,291","On three. One, two, three."
1366,"01:30:02,000","01:30:04,500","Oh, my God. You got a good smile!"
1367,"01:30:06,416","01:30:07,583",What's that?
1368,"01:30:11,291","01:30:12,333",That's…
1369,"01:30:13,583","01:30:14,583",weird.
1370,"01:30:32,041","01:30:33,916","God, I knew it! This cave is kapu!"
1371,"01:30:34,541","01:30:37,000",Eugh!
1372,"01:30:37,666","01:30:38,875",What does that mean?
1373,"01:30:39,416","01:30:43,500","It's sacred. I was worried this cave
would be a tomb and it is."
1374,"01:30:43,583","01:30:45,458",I still don't see the problem.
1375,"01:30:45,541","01:30:47,458","We used to believe
that when a person died,"
1376,"01:30:47,541","01:30:50,208","their bones held all their mana,
their power."
1377,"01:30:50,291","01:30:52,916","To protect the mana,
bones were hidden after death"
1378,"01:30:53,000","01:30:55,833","so that their location
would stay secret forever."
1379,"01:30:55,916","01:30:58,375","- So that's someone important?
- Yes."
1380,"01:30:58,958","01:31:01,125","I don't know who, but it doesn't matter."
1381,"01:31:01,208","01:31:04,125","We're disturbing their tomb,
and we shouldn't be here."
1382,"01:31:05,125","01:31:08,208",Okay. Let's just grab what you can.
1383,"01:31:08,291","01:31:10,791","- We'll figure a way out.
- No!"
1384,"01:31:11,416","01:31:13,416",We can't take any of this with us.
1385,"01:31:14,958","01:31:17,875","You can't expect us
to leave all this."
1386,"01:31:18,541","01:31:22,125","How are we gonna sell or show this
without telling where you found it?"
1387,"01:31:22,708","01:31:26,875","- What does it matter if we do?
- I said the remains need to stay hidden."
1388,"01:31:26,958","01:31:30,041","""We used to believe
the bones held power."""
1389,"01:31:30,125","01:31:32,791","- Now you don't. So who cares?
- You should."
1390,"01:31:32,875","01:31:35,791",You're native Hawaiian. Kanaka.
1391,"01:31:35,875","01:31:39,916","We tell anyone about this place,
they'll want to know who that is."
1392,"01:31:40,000","01:31:43,666","This cave will be crawling
with thrill-seeking tourists"
1393,"01:31:43,750","01:31:45,750",who wanna feel like Indiana Jones.
1394,"01:31:46,458","01:31:47,750",People like me.
1395,"01:31:48,500","01:31:50,458","Pili, that's not what I meant."
1396,"01:31:50,541","01:31:51,916",You're right though.
1397,"01:31:52,541","01:31:56,583","Monks, Robinson, and Brown
must have found this place by accident,"
1398,"01:31:57,208","01:31:59,500",not realizing it was a tomb.
1399,"01:32:14,041","01:32:16,416","Papa kept telling me
there wasn't any treasure."
1400,"01:32:16,958","01:32:18,666",Just the stories in the book.
1401,"01:32:19,500","01:32:20,708",He's a liar!
1402,"01:32:22,333","01:32:23,583",Because he knew.
1403,"01:32:23,666","01:32:26,000",He found this place.
1404,"01:32:26,083","01:32:29,166","It's why he hid that entrance
and cut that rope."
1405,"01:32:29,250","01:32:32,125","He kept this place a secret
out of respect…"
1406,"01:32:33,500","01:32:35,041",and aloha.
1407,"01:32:37,541","01:32:39,083","So, I will too."
1408,"01:32:42,041","01:32:43,250",Are you serious?
1409,"01:32:43,333","01:32:45,500",You're the reason we're here!
1410,"01:32:48,083","01:32:49,166",But they're right.
1411,"01:32:49,250","01:32:50,500",It's the right thing to do.
1412,"01:32:51,916","01:32:54,208","Oh, great. Now you too."
1413,"01:33:01,041","01:33:02,375",Come on. One second.
1414,"01:33:04,416","01:33:05,833",What the...
1415,"01:33:10,000","01:33:12,000",You know what? Y'all do y'all.
1416,"01:33:12,083","01:33:15,708","I'm gonna do what I gotta do
to get back home to New York."
1417,"01:33:17,000","01:33:18,625",You're literally tomb raiding.
1418,"01:33:18,708","01:33:21,208","This isn't even
whoever that is's treasure."
1419,"01:33:21,833","01:33:23,041",But it's their tomb.
1420,"01:33:23,125","01:33:26,375","Anything and everything left in it
is like an offering to them."
1421,"01:33:26,458","01:33:27,541",They're dead.
1422,"01:33:28,041","01:33:30,166",And dead people own nothing.
1423,"01:33:30,958","01:33:34,458","I didn't know she was gonna go up there
to get the treasure all by herself."
1424,"01:33:34,541","01:33:37,583","You're trying to tell me
that my kids are at Kualoa Ranch,"
1425,"01:33:37,666","01:33:39,458","possibly inside a mountain,"
1426,"01:33:39,541","01:33:42,416",looking for some fabled Spanish gold?
1427,"01:33:42,500","01:33:44,750","It's not a fable.
When I found the treasure,"
1428,"01:33:44,833","01:33:46,958","I understand why Monks
want leave it alone."
1429,"01:33:47,041","01:33:50,666","He never went back,
because the dude's kapu."
1430,"01:33:50,750","01:33:52,916",You should never disturb a place
1431,"01:33:53,000","01:33:54,791",that does not want to be disturbed.
1432,"01:33:56,916","01:33:59,875",Then the Night Marchers went after Monks!
1433,"01:34:01,333","01:34:03,041",No!
1434,"01:34:05,208","01:34:09,125","See? Taking treasure,
no powerful bones coming at me."
1435,"01:34:13,291","01:34:14,375",What was that?
1436,"01:34:23,500","01:34:24,833",What the heck?
1437,"01:34:31,250","01:34:32,083",Weird.
1438,"01:34:36,416","01:34:37,416",Run!
1439,"01:34:37,458","01:34:38,875",Come on! Hurry!
1440,"01:34:40,458","01:34:41,916",Hurry!
1441,"01:34:42,583","01:34:43,916",Watch your step!
1442,"01:34:44,500","01:34:45,500",Go!
1443,"01:34:50,083","01:34:51,416",Wait! Keanu!
1444,"01:34:55,416","01:34:57,333",Come on!
1445,"01:34:58,000","01:35:01,083","- Night Marchers?
- No, Pili, it's just a stupid story!"
1446,"01:35:01,166","01:35:03,166","- Are you talking about lapu?
- Go!"
1447,"01:35:07,583","01:35:09,875","- We gotta get out of here!
- How?"
1448,"01:35:14,875","01:35:15,958",The banyan roots!
1449,"01:35:20,833","01:35:23,708","Guys! I have to do one last thing.
I'll be right back!"
1450,"01:35:25,166","01:35:27,291","Pili, what are you doing?
Come back!"
1451,"01:35:34,083","01:35:36,958","Listen, cave,
I ain't got no beef with you,"
1452,"01:35:37,625","01:35:40,208",but I've gotta do this… for my papa.
1453,"01:35:41,208","01:35:42,791","Sorry, Keanu."
1454,"01:35:47,291","01:35:48,291",Yes!
1455,"01:35:52,875","01:35:53,958",Gotta go!
1456,"01:36:00,541","01:36:03,125","Guys, we have to go! Like, now!"
1457,"01:36:06,958","01:36:08,041",What's that smell?
1458,"01:36:10,583","01:36:11,583",They're coming.
1459,"01:36:13,583","01:36:17,083","Guys, whatever you do,
do not look at the lapu, okay?"
1460,"01:36:18,166","01:36:20,375","If you do, you're dead."
1461,"01:36:22,166","01:36:24,500","- Bobby Shytles!
- That turd was right!"
1462,"01:36:24,583","01:36:25,833","E, take this."
1463,"01:36:26,750","01:36:29,458","- Hana, are you ready?
- What is this for?"
1464,"01:36:29,541","01:36:33,000","Just remember, the banyan roots
are stronger than they look"
1465,"01:36:33,083","01:36:34,208",and so are you.
1466,"01:36:35,083","01:36:36,083",Do you trust me?
1467,"01:36:37,000","01:36:38,666","- Yes.
- Then jump."
1468,"01:36:49,708","01:36:50,708",It worked!
1469,"01:36:51,625","01:36:53,583","Okay, let go!"
1470,"01:37:07,416","01:37:08,500",We gotta go!
1471,"01:37:08,583","01:37:11,250","On the count of three! One, two,"
1472,"01:37:11,333","01:37:12,791",three!
1473,"01:37:37,083","01:37:40,625",E!
1474,"01:37:48,250","01:37:50,625",E!
1475,"01:37:51,416","01:37:54,458","E, where are you? E!"
1476,"01:37:54,541","01:37:57,333","Move your arms and legs.
The shore is right there!"
1477,"01:37:57,416","01:37:59,541",Go! Just go!
1478,"01:38:17,083","01:38:18,583",Hana!
1479,"01:38:19,333","01:38:20,500",Casper!
1480,"01:38:21,791","01:38:22,833",Guys!
1481,"01:38:24,291","01:38:25,875",Where are you?
1482,"01:38:39,583","01:38:40,750",E!
1483,"01:38:43,791","01:38:45,541","E, are you okay?"
1484,"01:38:47,750","01:38:49,500","Come on, over here!"
1485,"01:38:49,583","01:38:51,375","Over here! Over here, over here!"
1486,"01:38:54,083","01:38:55,083",Is he okay?
1487,"01:38:55,166","01:38:56,875","Oh, God, he's not breathing."
1488,"01:38:56,958","01:38:58,250","Move, I know CPR."
1489,"01:38:58,333","01:39:00,041",One. Two. Three. Four.

1498,"01:39:24,833","01:39:26,416",It's a brown violin spider bite.
1499,"01:39:26,500","01:39:28,916","- What?
- I am so sorry for breaking our bro code."
1500,"01:39:29,000","01:39:31,375",It's nothing. Go on.
1501,"01:39:34,125","01:39:35,416",What's that sound?
1502,"01:39:37,666","01:39:38,500",We gotta go!
1503,"01:39:38,583","01:39:40,416","- Come on, guys!

1510,"01:40:18,958","01:40:21,750","Come on, E. We're almost out."
1511,"01:40:29,166","01:40:32,083","- Why are they still after us?

- Oh, my God!"
1517,"01:40:47,125","01:40:49,333",Are you okay?
1518,"01:40:50,208","01:40:51,250","Oh, my God!"
1519,"01:41:06,500","01:41:07,958",Protect my children.

1530,"01:41:54,458","01:41:56,833","Oh, my God.
What happened to your hand?"
1531,"01:41:58,958","01:42:00,291",It's okay.
1532,"01:42:00,375","01:42:01,458","It's okay, Casper."
1533,"01:42:03,166","01:42:05,375",It's okay. I'm here.
1534,"01:42:11,041","01:42:12,083",What are you doing?
1535,"01:42:16,875","01:42:18,166",It's okay. Hold on.
1536,"01:42:20,625","01:42:22,750",How did you get that?
1537,"01:42:30,500","01:42:32,500","I'm sorry, Mom. I'm so sorry."
1538,"01:42:32,583","01:42:34,750",I just didn't want to lose Papa.
1539,"01:42:35,333","01:42:36,333","It's okay, baby."
1540,"01:42:36,375","01:42:38,333",It's okay.
1541,"01:42:40,208","01:42:41,875",It's okay.
1542,"01:42:58,708","01:42:59,833",Mine.
1543,"01:43:16,583","01:43:17,583",Kua.
1544,"01:43:29,083","01:43:30,083",Dad.
1545,"01:44:34,458","01:44:35,791","I promise, Dad."
1546,"01:46:29,458","01:46:31,375",WAHIAWA GENERAL HOSPITAL
1547,"01:46:31,458","01:46:34,916","And remember,
we can't talk about this with anyone."
1548,"01:46:35,000","01:46:37,958","No Night Marchers, no treasure, nothing."
1549,"01:46:38,458","01:46:40,375",It's all huna.
1550,"01:46:42,791","01:46:44,750","So, wait."
1551,"01:46:45,375","01:46:48,291","E told me your face melts off
if you look at a nightmarcher."
1552,"01:46:48,875","01:46:50,708",Why didn't that happen to us?
1553,"01:46:50,791","01:46:55,500","Because you get the koko of your father,
the koko of a fallen warrior."
1554,"01:46:55,583","01:46:57,958",The lapu saw you as ohana.
1555,"01:46:59,291","01:47:01,083","So, Dad?"
1556,"01:47:01,750","01:47:03,500",He protected all of us?
1557,"01:47:03,583","01:47:04,916",Mhm.
1558,"01:47:05,458","01:47:07,583","So, where the boy?"
1559,"01:47:15,500","01:47:17,291",Ow! Watch the hand!
1560,"01:47:17,375","01:47:21,458","Or you could be better
about keeping it out of the way, E."
1561,"01:47:22,166","01:47:24,500","Actually, it's Ioane."
1562,"01:47:25,583","01:47:27,166","- Really?
- It's a good name."
1563,"01:47:27,250","01:47:29,583",Ioane is a very good name.
1564,"01:47:30,208","01:47:31,583",Especially when you say it.
1565,"01:47:49,541","01:47:52,791","- Sorry about losing your journal.
- Ah, it's okay."
1566,"01:47:53,416","01:47:55,333","Probably better off anyway, huh?"
1567,"01:47:56,500","01:47:58,541","- Can I ask you something?
- Yeah."
1568,"01:47:58,625","01:48:03,000","What really happened at the end
for Robinson, Brown, and Monks?"
1569,"01:48:03,083","01:48:06,875","Before they hid the treasure,
Monks thought"
1570,"01:48:06,958","01:48:11,791","how lucky he was to survive,
but it had nothing to do with luck"
1571,"01:48:11,875","01:48:13,916",and everything to do about greed.
1572,"01:48:15,125","01:48:18,625",Robinson and Brown turned on their crew.
1573,"01:48:19,333","01:48:21,916",They was never gonna split the treasure.
1574,"01:48:22,000","01:48:23,958",I knew Monks wasn't a bad guy!
1575,"01:48:25,333","01:48:28,833","Maybe Robinson knew
Brown was gonna double cross him!"
1576,"01:48:28,916","01:48:30,458",And they started fighting!
1577,"01:48:35,291","01:48:36,583","They lost their weapons,"
1578,"01:48:36,666","01:48:40,125","and they looked for stuff to fight with
because the cave was so messy!"
1579,"01:48:40,708","01:48:43,375",And there were coins all over the place!
1580,"01:48:46,458","01:48:50,291","They fought with the candlesticks.
There are pieces of them everywhere!"
1581,"01:48:51,333","01:48:52,583","""Oh, dip!"""
1582,"01:48:52,666","01:48:54,250","Their fight got so crazy,"
1583,"01:48:54,333","01:48:57,541",they had no idea they ran into a tomb.
1584,"01:48:57,625","01:48:59,458","Yes, they make pilikia,"
1585,"01:48:59,541","01:49:00,958",trouble in those caves.
1586,"01:49:01,041","01:49:03,291","And after they disturbed the tomb,"
1587,"01:49:03,375","01:49:06,250","all of their bad intentions
came back upon them"
1588,"01:49:06,333","01:49:09,958",and then they heard the sounds of drums.
1589,"01:49:11,916","01:49:13,583",The lapu had been awakened!
1590,"01:49:17,875","01:49:21,583","The last thing Monks heard
before he went jump"
1591,"01:49:21,666","01:49:25,208",was Robinson and Brown's screams.
1592,"01:49:30,625","01:49:32,791","So, Monks was never a bad guy?"
1593,"01:49:32,875","01:49:34,916","Nah, he was never one bad guy."
1594,"01:49:35,958","01:49:39,375","He was just a kid…
trying to get back to his ohana."
1595,"01:49:40,291","01:49:42,416","So, after he jumped,"
1596,"01:49:42,500","01:49:45,166","is that when our ohana
found him on the beach?"
1597,"01:49:45,250","01:49:46,250",Ae.
1598,"01:49:47,125","01:49:49,708","And now you know the whole story, yeah?"
1599,"01:50:02,208","01:50:03,541","Thanks, Papa."
1600,"01:50:20,791","01:50:23,666","Watch out, Ioane!
Here comes Daddy!"
1601,"01:50:26,791","01:50:30,083","Can you take care of Mommy
and your sister?"
1602,"01:50:31,083","01:50:33,375","Pili, girl! Look at Mommy! Pili!"
1603,"01:50:33,458","01:50:36,375","-  Look at her face!
- Yes, there we go!"
1604,"01:50:36,458","01:50:39,708","-  Stand up!
- Baby Godzilla!"
1605,"01:50:41,083","01:50:42,333",I'm gonna miss you.
1606,"01:50:42,833","01:50:44,708","- I love you.
- I love you, too."
1607,"01:50:49,291","01:50:51,958",No! I got the camera!
1608,"01:50:58,083","01:51:00,000","- Dad was so handsome.
- I know."
1609,"01:51:00,708","01:51:02,125",That's where I got it from.
1610,"01:51:03,041","01:51:07,333","- Oh, you don't want to see that.
- Hey, stop!"
1611,"01:51:07,416","01:51:11,250","- Watch it! Pili!
- Okay, my mo'opunas."
1612,"01:51:12,458","01:51:14,000","- Mahalo, Papa.
- Mahalo nui!"
1613,"01:51:14,666","01:51:16,666","Okay,
it's time for a family meeting."
1614,"01:51:17,000","01:51:18,250",So…
1615,"01:51:18,333","01:51:20,833","I've made some of, well…"
1616,"01:51:21,416","01:51:25,083","all of the most impactful decisions
of our lives."
1617,"01:51:26,166","01:51:28,083",I don't want to do that anymore.
1618,"01:51:30,250","01:51:31,666",Because we're ohana.
1619,"01:51:33,583","01:51:35,458",So here's the situation.
1620,"01:51:36,291","01:51:39,083","We can't afford to settle
all of Papa's bills…"
1621,"01:51:40,250","01:51:42,291",unless we sell our apartment.
1622,"01:51:43,041","01:51:44,083",In Brooklyn.
1623,"01:51:45,291","01:51:46,833",Which means…
1624,"01:51:46,916","01:51:49,791",either Papa will have to move to Brooklyn…
1625,"01:51:54,791","01:51:56,458",or we'll have to move to Hawaii.
1626,"01:52:05,500","01:52:07,666","So, let's talk about it."
