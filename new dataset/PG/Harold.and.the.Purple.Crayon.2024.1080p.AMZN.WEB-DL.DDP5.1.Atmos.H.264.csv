1,"00:01:10,638","00:01:12,840","Once there was a boy
named Harold,"
2,"00:01:12,974","00:01:15,275",who went on an adventure.
3,"00:01:15,409","00:01:18,211","And he took
his purple crayon with him."
4,"00:01:18,345","00:01:19,747",Aha!
5,"00:01:19,881","00:01:22,316","He could draw
whatever he wanted."
6,"00:01:24,552","00:01:27,555","And sometimes,
that got him in over his head."
7,"00:01:28,990","00:01:31,626","But he always came up
thinking fast."
8,"00:01:33,561","00:01:35,930","And it was on
to the next adventure."
9,"00:01:38,231","00:01:40,501","He did what anyone
would do with a magic crayon."
10,"00:01:40,635","00:01:43,771","He made some pies,
and then he made some friends."
11,"00:01:43,905","00:01:46,173","He called them
Moose and Porcupine."
12,"00:01:46,306","00:01:47,407","Come on, everybody."
13,"00:01:47,542","00:01:49,644",For obvious reasons.
14,"00:01:51,345","00:01:54,247",Not again!
15,"00:01:55,717","00:01:57,785","They never left
each other's sides."
16,"00:01:57,919","00:02:01,188","Even when they got lost,
they always found each other."
17,"00:02:01,321","00:02:02,957","No matter where they were,"
18,"00:02:03,091","00:02:06,861","Harold always remembered
where his bedroom window was."
19,"00:02:06,995","00:02:08,763",Right around the moon.
20,"00:02:12,299","00:02:13,300","Night, Harold."
21,"00:02:13,433","00:02:14,869",Good night.
22,"00:02:18,405","00:02:19,373",The end.
23,"00:02:19,507","00:02:21,042","Good night, folks."
24,"00:02:21,174","00:02:23,878","Just kidding! Of course
the story didn't end there."
25,"00:02:25,913","00:02:27,115","Come on, everybody!"
26,"00:02:28,448","00:02:30,450",I need to go down now!
27,"00:02:30,585","00:02:32,386",His world got bigger.
28,"00:02:32,520","00:02:35,590",And so did his imagination.
29,"00:02:35,723","00:02:37,859","You got that right, Narrator!"
30,"00:02:37,992","00:02:40,028",My stomachs are sloshing around!
31,"00:02:40,160","00:02:42,563","-Harold, look out!
-What?"
32,"00:02:43,430","00:02:44,498","Hey, everybody!"
33,"00:02:47,902","00:02:51,338","And he still got in
over his head."
34,"00:02:53,574","00:02:55,409","But he always came up
thinking fast."
35,"00:02:55,543","00:02:57,244",Little help here!
36,"00:02:58,278","00:02:59,947",Faster than that.
37,"00:03:01,149","00:03:02,917","-Harold!
-I got it!"
38,"00:03:03,417","00:03:04,786","Oh, hi!"
39,"00:03:04,919","00:03:06,821","With his purple crayon,"
40,"00:03:06,954","00:03:07,989",anything was possible.
41,"00:03:08,122","00:03:09,289",Gotcha!
42,"00:03:10,992","00:03:13,493","-Oh, careful there.
-Sorry, Moose."
43,"00:03:16,164","00:03:17,865",Hmmph.
44,"00:03:17,999","00:03:19,567",I've been thinking.
45,"00:03:19,701","00:03:22,235","If I drew you guys,
then who drew me?"
46,"00:03:23,437","00:03:24,471",That's deep.
47,"00:03:24,605","00:03:25,940","I drew you, Harold."
48,"00:03:26,074","00:03:28,843","-You did?
-Mm-hmm. I sure did."
49,"00:03:28,976","00:03:30,178",What do you look like?
50,"00:03:30,310","00:03:32,046","I used to look
a little like you."
51,"00:03:32,180","00:03:33,514",But I'm an old man now.
52,"00:03:33,648","00:03:35,817","I guess in a way,
I'm your old man."
53,"00:03:35,950","00:03:37,151",My old man.
54,"00:03:38,820","00:03:41,589","So then why can't I
see you, Old Man?"
55,"00:03:41,723","00:03:43,725","Because
I'm someplace else."
56,"00:03:43,858","00:03:45,159",The Real World.
57,"00:03:45,292","00:03:48,295",The Real World. Wow.
58,"00:03:48,428","00:03:49,831",What's that?
59,"00:03:49,964","00:03:51,532","Well,
it's kind of like your world"
60,"00:03:51,666","00:03:52,967",only a bit more colorful.
61,"00:03:53,101","00:03:54,367",And a lot more complicated.
62,"00:03:54,502","00:03:56,637","Well, it sounds amazing.
Can I visit you someday?"
63,"00:03:56,771","00:03:58,573","Oh,
I wish that was possible."
64,"00:03:58,706","00:04:01,341","But with the crayon
anything is possible, right?"
65,"00:04:01,475","00:04:02,810","Good night, Harold."
66,"00:04:02,944","00:04:04,912","Wait, wait, wait, Old Man.
One more question."
67,"00:04:05,046","00:04:07,347","-Why did you draw me?
-Night, Harold."
68,"00:04:07,481","00:04:09,249","Okay, okay."
69,"00:04:09,382","00:04:10,818","Good night, Old Man."
70,"00:04:21,261","00:04:22,897","So, Old Man, I've been thinking"
71,"00:04:23,030","00:04:26,033","and I've got
a lot of follow-up questions."
72,"00:04:27,702","00:04:28,669",Old Man?
73,"00:04:29,170","00:04:30,638",You there?
74,"00:04:30,772","00:04:33,808",Old Man. Hello!
75,"00:04:33,941","00:04:35,843",Old Man!
76,"00:04:39,013","00:04:41,983",Old Man!
77,"00:04:42,917","00:04:45,253","All of a sudden
this guy goes quiet?"
78,"00:04:45,385","00:04:46,353",I don't think so.
79,"00:04:46,486","00:04:47,922",This man loved to talk.
80,"00:04:48,055","00:04:50,725","Maybe he's busy
being real in the Real World."
81,"00:04:50,858","00:04:52,560",I'm deep.
82,"00:04:52,693","00:04:55,563","That's it! Guys,
let's go to the Real World!"
83,"00:04:55,696","00:04:58,331","Oh, no, no, no.
We don't wanna do that."
84,"00:05:00,768","00:05:03,470","With the crayon,
anything is possible."
85,"00:05:03,604","00:05:05,973","That's not how it works, Harold.
You can't just--"
86,"00:05:10,845","00:05:11,946",Whoa!
87,"00:05:12,079","00:05:13,581",Yeah! Let's go!
88,"00:05:15,116","00:05:17,652","You heard the old man.
The Real World is constipated."
89,"00:05:17,785","00:05:19,352",And who knows what that means.
90,"00:05:19,486","00:05:22,489","Okay, fine. You two stay here
in case my old man comes back."
91,"00:05:22,623","00:05:24,058",Great idea.
92,"00:05:24,192","00:05:26,227","And I'm gonna go look for him
out there. Don't worry."
93,"00:05:26,359","00:05:27,862","-I got this!
-Wait!"
94,"00:05:37,972","00:05:40,942",What is he wearing?
95,"00:05:41,474","00:05:42,877",It's so bright.
96,"00:05:43,578","00:05:45,079",It's so beautiful.
97,"00:05:46,147","00:05:47,682",What are you doing?
98,"00:05:47,815","00:05:50,318","It's very confusing.
I'm new here, but--"
99,"00:05:50,450","00:05:51,786","Oh, hello."
100,"00:05:51,919","00:05:53,154",Very creative.
101,"00:05:55,790","00:05:56,791",Near.
102,"00:05:57,390","00:05:58,358",Far.
103,"00:05:58,491","00:06:00,493",Near. Far. Three dimensions.
104,"00:06:00,628","00:06:02,663","Oh, it's even cooler
than I imagined!"
105,"00:06:02,797","00:06:04,532",Look at all the friendly people!
106,"00:06:04,665","00:06:07,501","-Oh, excuse me. Where are we?
-Get lost, Smurf."
107,"00:06:07,635","00:06:10,437","-We're going after him, right?
-Mmh-mmh. Nope."
108,"00:06:10,571","00:06:14,275","Aw, come on. Just a peek."
109,"00:06:14,407","00:06:16,177","-All right, all right.
-Yes!"
110,"00:06:16,310","00:06:17,578",Just a peek.
111,"00:06:20,514","00:06:22,083",What's it look like?
112,"00:06:22,216","00:06:26,153","I can't tell. It's...
It's all mysterious and fuzzy."
113,"00:06:26,287","00:06:29,957",Maybe you should look closer.
114,"00:06:33,361","00:06:35,062","Aw, come on!"
115,"00:06:42,503","00:06:44,404",The Real World.
116,"00:06:45,573","00:06:47,942",Why do my hooves feel so soft?
117,"00:07:02,256","00:07:03,456",Hi!
118,"00:07:04,392","00:07:05,726",What are we running from?
119,"00:07:05,860","00:07:07,628",A grown man in a onesie.
120,"00:07:11,431","00:07:12,633",Oh.
121,"00:07:14,101","00:07:15,569",Real World clothes.
122,"00:07:21,342","00:07:22,543",Different.
123,"00:07:22,677","00:07:23,878",Leavin' me behind.
124,"00:07:24,011","00:07:26,681",You're not gonna last one day.
125,"00:07:26,814","00:07:28,149",Don't worry.
126,"00:07:28,282","00:07:30,384",Porcupine's on the way.
127,"00:07:30,518","00:07:31,786",Yes!
128,"00:07:33,020","00:07:34,522",No thumbs!
129,"00:07:35,990","00:07:37,024",That's not good.
130,"00:07:41,595","00:07:42,964",It's him! Old Man!
131,"00:07:43,097","00:07:45,299",Old Man! Old Man!
132,"00:07:45,433","00:07:46,901",Harold?
133,"00:07:47,034","00:07:49,537","Harold! Harold! It's me, Moose!"
134,"00:07:49,670","00:07:50,871","-Moose?
-Yes, yes."
135,"00:07:51,005","00:07:53,040","Oh, hi."
136,"00:07:53,174","00:07:55,276","Hi, buddy!
You look so different."
137,"00:07:55,409","00:07:58,245","-I look strange, right?
-No, no, you look really cool."
138,"00:07:58,379","00:07:59,747","-Are you sure?
-Oh, yeah."
139,"00:07:59,880","00:08:01,749","Okay, this Real World thing
is real."
140,"00:08:01,882","00:08:03,284","It's really real.
And guess what."
141,"00:08:03,417","00:08:05,753","It's only getting better,
because we found him."
142,"00:08:05,886","00:08:07,955",The old man. He's right here.
143,"00:08:08,089","00:08:09,423",Let's go!
144,"00:08:09,557","00:08:12,126","Old Man! It's Harold! Finally!
Ow!"
145,"00:08:12,259","00:08:13,527",Hey! Get away from me!
146,"00:08:13,661","00:08:15,262","Ow! Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow!"
147,"00:08:15,396","00:08:16,630",Why would you do that?
148,"00:08:16,764","00:08:18,132","Uh, Harold, maybe we
got the wrong guy."
149,"00:08:18,265","00:08:20,301","You're probably right,
Moose."
150,"00:08:20,434","00:08:23,671","Have a good day, Not Old Man!"
151,"00:08:23,804","00:08:25,106",The Real World is huge.
152,"00:08:25,239","00:08:27,141","There has to be at least
10 to 20 old men here."
153,"00:08:27,274","00:08:29,510","Yeah. We got a lot
of ground to cover."
154,"00:08:49,230","00:08:51,632","Real world, here I come!"
155,"00:09:14,588","00:09:16,657",Thumbs!
156,"00:09:16,791","00:09:19,260",Yes! Yes.
157,"00:09:20,361","00:09:23,197","Whoa.
Look at these legs!"
158,"00:09:24,465","00:09:25,666",Whoa.
159,"00:09:26,233","00:09:27,968",Ah. Aah.
160,"00:09:33,207","00:09:35,042","Look out, world."
161,"00:09:35,443","00:09:36,777",I'm big.
162,"00:09:38,547","00:09:40,247",Hi. I'm Porcupine.
163,"00:09:40,381","00:09:41,782",I'm a bunny.
164,"00:09:42,249","00:09:43,284",No way.
165,"00:09:45,453","00:09:46,720",Hi!
166,"00:09:49,924","00:09:53,260","-Get off the road!
-Nice day for a ride!"
167,"00:09:53,394","00:09:54,962","Hey, Prasad."
168,"00:09:55,096","00:09:57,098","I know,
I won't miss another sh--"
169,"00:09:57,231","00:09:59,800","I won't miss another shift.
I just--"
170,"00:10:00,701","00:10:01,936","Come on, Prasad."
171,"00:10:02,069","00:10:04,338","I had to take my kid
to a school thing."
172,"00:10:04,472","00:10:07,708","She should not be
using her phone while driving."
173,"00:10:10,545","00:10:11,712","-Uh, Harold?
-Yeah?"
174,"00:10:11,846","00:10:13,380","I don't think
we're doing this right!"
175,"00:10:13,515","00:10:15,116","-Okay.
-Look out!"
176,"00:10:15,249","00:10:17,985",Excuse us! Excuse us!
177,"00:10:18,119","00:10:20,054","-Prasad. Hold on.
-Mom!"
178,"00:10:27,161","00:10:28,929","-Are you okay?
-Yeah."
179,"00:10:32,500","00:10:33,767",Oh...
180,"00:10:34,735","00:10:37,304","You okay, Carl?
It's okay, buddy."
181,"00:10:37,438","00:10:39,640","Felt like my old self
for a second."
182,"00:10:39,773","00:10:41,342","I don't know
if it was a fear thing."
183,"00:10:41,475","00:10:43,644","Oh, my God! Are you okay?
I'm so sorry!"
184,"00:10:43,777","00:10:45,479",I didn't see you there.
185,"00:10:45,614","00:10:48,682","I thought I saw a moose.
Did you guys see a moose?"
186,"00:10:48,816","00:10:49,783",Yeah. I'm a moose.
187,"00:10:49,917","00:10:51,685",I think you have a concussion.
188,"00:10:51,819","00:10:53,354","My insides are coming out
my outsides!"
189,"00:10:53,487","00:10:55,156","I'm gonna
get you a Band-Aid."
190,"00:10:55,289","00:10:57,091",I think I have one in my purse.
191,"00:10:58,325","00:10:59,994","Oh... Oh, shoot."
192,"00:11:00,127","00:11:03,197","I got a flat tire. Sorry,
one sec. Just hang on. Um..."
193,"00:11:03,330","00:11:04,999",Hang on one sec.
194,"00:11:06,167","00:11:08,035","Hi. Yeah, I'm gonna need a tire."
195,"00:11:08,169","00:11:10,905",I have a flat and no spare.
196,"00:11:11,038","00:11:12,840","Yeah, I'll hold. Thank you."
197,"00:11:21,115","00:11:23,150","-How did you do that?
-Shh!"
198,"00:11:23,284","00:11:24,285","Hi, I'm--"
199,"00:11:28,122","00:11:29,890","Wow, you are really
good at that."
200,"00:11:30,024","00:11:32,026","She's not actually
changing a tire."
201,"00:11:32,159","00:11:34,128","She's just attaching it
onto the car."
202,"00:11:34,261","00:11:37,865","-That's how you change a tire.
-That's how you change a tire."
203,"00:11:40,434","00:11:42,136",What's that?
204,"00:11:42,269","00:11:44,639","Oh, it's...
It's my whistle for Carl."
205,"00:11:44,772","00:11:47,341",Ahh!
206,"00:11:47,474","00:11:48,842","Wow, that was loud!"
207,"00:11:49,544","00:11:50,711","Uh, who's Carl?"
208,"00:11:50,844","00:11:52,346",He's my Dragolizagator.
209,"00:11:52,479","00:11:54,481","-He's right there.
-Huh?"
210,"00:11:55,883","00:11:57,284",Is he really small?
211,"00:11:57,418","00:11:59,554","He's got amazing
camouflage abilities."
212,"00:11:59,688","00:12:00,689",Oh.
213,"00:12:00,821","00:12:03,658","He's part eagle,
lion, alligator."
214,"00:12:03,791","00:12:06,561","You know what, kiddo?
Let's not do Carl today, okay?"
215,"00:12:07,328","00:12:09,598","Well, he's licking me,"
216,"00:12:09,730","00:12:10,931",which is a little ticklish.
217,"00:12:11,065","00:12:12,900","Oh, that tickles!
But he's lick--"
218,"00:12:13,033","00:12:14,435","Oh, it tickles! Oh, it tickles!"
219,"00:12:14,569","00:12:17,004","-He's going after you.
-He's going after you, Moose!"
220,"00:12:17,137","00:12:19,039","Don't worry.
He's just trying to sniff you"
221,"00:12:19,173","00:12:20,374",to see if you're friendly.
222,"00:12:20,508","00:12:21,775",I'm a moose. Get your sniff on.
223,"00:12:23,545","00:12:26,347","By the way,
I'm Terry and this is Mel."
224,"00:12:26,814","00:12:28,249","Hi, I'm Harold."
225,"00:12:28,382","00:12:29,483",Moose again.
226,"00:12:29,618","00:12:30,851",I'm so sorry for everything.
227,"00:12:30,985","00:12:32,721","Can I give you guys
a ride somewhere?"
228,"00:12:32,853","00:12:34,154",It's the least I can do.
229,"00:12:34,288","00:12:35,422",Sure.
230,"00:12:44,798","00:12:46,367",Old Man!
231,"00:12:46,500","00:12:47,468",No! Stop!
232,"00:12:47,602","00:12:48,869",Hi!
233,"00:12:49,003","00:12:50,871","My goodness.
What is it with you people?"
234,"00:12:51,005","00:12:52,574","It's me, Porcupine."
235,"00:12:52,707","00:12:55,142","If you don't want any trouble,
you better get out of here."
236,"00:12:55,276","00:12:57,278",What are you doing?
237,"00:12:58,445","00:13:00,447",Aw. No quills.
238,"00:13:00,582","00:13:02,550","This really
is a brand-new world."
239,"00:13:09,923","00:13:11,392",I'm glad you guys are okay.
240,"00:13:11,526","00:13:14,795",And that you're not litigious.
241,"00:13:15,796","00:13:17,766","Sorry about hitting you
back there."
242,"00:13:17,898","00:13:19,233","Uh, where can I drop you off?"
243,"00:13:19,366","00:13:21,802","Uh, well, the old man's house
would be great."
244,"00:13:21,935","00:13:24,338",You mean your dad?
245,"00:13:24,471","00:13:27,441","Yeah. I mean,
I guess you could call him that."
246,"00:13:27,575","00:13:28,677","If it weren't for him,"
247,"00:13:28,809","00:13:30,745","I wouldn't exist, so..."
248,"00:13:30,878","00:13:32,346",Where does he live?
249,"00:13:32,479","00:13:35,182","Well, we were hoping
that you would know."
250,"00:13:35,316","00:13:37,184","-Where your dad lives?
-Yes."
251,"00:13:37,318","00:13:40,154","Uh, no, I do not know that."
252,"00:13:40,287","00:13:42,823","But I'm happy to drop you
at a bus station"
253,"00:13:42,956","00:13:44,592","or wherever
you're staying tonight."
254,"00:13:44,726","00:13:45,993","Well, we don't exactly know"
255,"00:13:46,126","00:13:48,128","where we're gonna stay
tonight just yet."
256,"00:13:48,262","00:13:51,398","Yeah. And you're the only people
we actually know, so..."
257,"00:13:51,533","00:13:52,866",They can stay with us.
258,"00:13:53,000","00:13:54,268",New friends! Yay!
259,"00:13:54,401","00:13:56,837","Oh, gosh, that would be so fun."
260,"00:13:56,970","00:13:58,439",But we don't have a room.
261,"00:13:58,573","00:14:00,742","Yeah, we do, Mom.
Above the garage."
262,"00:14:00,874","00:14:02,510","No, Mel,
they're not staying with us."
263,"00:14:02,644","00:14:05,714","I'm sorry, we just don't
know you, really, at all."
264,"00:14:05,846","00:14:07,081","Mom, we can't just abandon them."
265,"00:14:07,214","00:14:08,415","You hit them,
you broke their bike."
266,"00:14:08,550","00:14:10,417","And they don't
have anywhere to stay."
267,"00:14:11,352","00:14:14,054","Dad always said,
""When people need help..."""
268,"00:14:14,689","00:14:15,956","""We help."""
269,"00:14:16,090","00:14:18,560","Yeah. Yeah, we do say that."
270,"00:14:19,794","00:14:22,029","Okay, fine."
271,"00:14:22,162","00:14:24,164",One night. Above the garage.
272,"00:14:25,032","00:14:26,033",Yes!
273,"00:14:26,166","00:14:27,201","Wow, that's a lot of emphasis"
274,"00:14:27,334","00:14:28,469","-on ""above the garage.""
-Yeah."
275,"00:14:28,603","00:14:30,839","Just don't get
too excited, okay?"
276,"00:14:30,971","00:14:34,642","That's what people
say when it's really exciting."
277,"00:14:36,110","00:14:37,478",Above the garage!
278,"00:14:37,612","00:14:40,849","Above the garage!
Above the garage!"
279,"00:14:40,981","00:14:42,449",Is this your house?
280,"00:14:42,584","00:14:44,084","Ooh, nice!"
281,"00:14:46,855","00:14:48,422",Home sweet home.
282,"00:14:48,556","00:14:51,693","Could use a new coat of paint
and a new roof,"
283,"00:14:51,826","00:14:54,194",and a lot of other things.
284,"00:14:54,328","00:14:56,263",I think it looks great.
285,"00:14:57,732","00:15:00,200",Here's the palace.
286,"00:15:01,301","00:15:03,270","Oh, Terry, this is amazing!"
287,"00:15:03,404","00:15:05,840","Do you see this?
She has a wall bed."
288,"00:15:05,973","00:15:07,374",This is so classy.
289,"00:15:07,509","00:15:10,110","How did you know
I sleep standin' up?"
290,"00:15:10,244","00:15:11,713","Oh, you know what,"
291,"00:15:11,846","00:15:13,414","I never got around to donating
any of these clothes,"
292,"00:15:13,548","00:15:15,449","so please help yourself
to anything that fits you."
293,"00:15:15,583","00:15:17,418",What's this music?
294,"00:15:17,552","00:15:21,221","Oh, that would be nothing.
Just junk from my old life."
295,"00:15:22,022","00:15:23,157",You're a musician.
296,"00:15:23,290","00:15:24,893","Yeah, I was."
297,"00:15:25,025","00:15:26,661","I just, you know..."
298,"00:15:26,795","00:15:29,564","When you're young,
you have all kinds of dreams,"
299,"00:15:29,697","00:15:32,700","and then the world
just kicks it out of you."
300,"00:15:32,834","00:15:34,001","I've never been kicked before,"
301,"00:15:34,134","00:15:36,538","but I was hit by a guy
with a cane."
302,"00:15:37,037","00:15:38,305",So I hear ya.
303,"00:15:38,439","00:15:41,475","Now I stock shelves
at Ollie's."
304,"00:15:42,777","00:15:43,977","You know, uh,"
305,"00:15:44,111","00:15:45,979",Ollie's?
306,"00:15:46,113","00:15:47,582","It's like a store
that sells everything."
307,"00:15:47,715","00:15:49,349","You work at a store
that sells everything?"
308,"00:15:49,483","00:15:51,018","That sounds like
the best job ever."
309,"00:15:51,151","00:15:53,588","Yeah. Mm-hmm.
Ollie's is the best job ever."
310,"00:15:53,721","00:15:55,222","Yes, it is."
311,"00:15:55,355","00:15:57,224","Kudos. Good thing
you don't do music anymore,"
312,"00:15:57,357","00:15:59,993","you wouldn't have an amazing job
like Ollie's!"
313,"00:16:00,127","00:16:01,161",Yeah.
314,"00:16:01,295","00:16:02,229",I hate my job.
315,"00:16:02,362","00:16:04,599","Um, anyway, what do you guys do?"
316,"00:16:05,098","00:16:06,868","Well, I draw."
317,"00:16:07,000","00:16:09,203","-Hmm. An artist.
-Yeah."
318,"00:16:10,705","00:16:11,706",Um...
319,"00:16:13,073","00:16:14,041",What do you do?
320,"00:16:14,174","00:16:16,276",Besides that?
321,"00:16:16,410","00:16:18,145","I basically
just follow him around"
322,"00:16:18,278","00:16:19,581",in a moose-like fashion.
323,"00:16:19,714","00:16:22,617",Every day.
324,"00:16:24,117","00:16:26,119","Okay. Well, um..."
325,"00:16:26,253","00:16:27,856","I'm gonna triple lock the door,"
326,"00:16:27,988","00:16:30,558","just, you know,
to keep any weirdos out."
327,"00:16:30,692","00:16:33,595","You guys can hit the road
in the morning. 'Kay?"
328,"00:16:33,728","00:16:34,796",Enjoy.
329,"00:16:34,929","00:16:37,364","-Thank you, Terry.
-Mm-hmm."
330,"00:16:40,133","00:16:42,069","Moose, we are so lucky."
331,"00:16:42,202","00:16:43,872",Look at all this!
332,"00:16:44,004","00:16:45,372","Are we lucky, Harold?"
333,"00:16:45,507","00:16:47,709","I don't think we belong
here in the Real World."
334,"00:16:47,842","00:16:50,645","You know, with all the pain.
It's just all so different."
335,"00:16:50,778","00:16:53,146","Well, of course
it's different, buddy."
336,"00:16:53,280","00:16:54,516",It's a different world.
337,"00:16:54,649","00:16:56,684","It's the Real World.
It's an adventure."
338,"00:16:56,818","00:16:58,586","That's kind of fun, right?"
339,"00:16:58,720","00:17:00,454","Hey, look.
We'll find the old man,"
340,"00:17:00,588","00:17:02,055","he'll start narrating again,"
341,"00:17:02,189","00:17:04,024","and then everything
will go back to normal."
342,"00:17:04,157","00:17:06,360","-Then we go home?
-Yeah."
343,"00:17:09,463","00:17:11,699",He made a bicycle with a crayon.
344,"00:17:11,833","00:17:13,968",Then she says she's a porcupine.
345,"00:17:14,101","00:17:15,202","""Porcupine."""
346,"00:17:15,335","00:17:17,070","You did the right thing
by calling us."
347,"00:17:17,204","00:17:18,606","We'll put together
a special task force,"
348,"00:17:18,740","00:17:20,975","and, uh, we'll definitely
keep you updated."
349,"00:17:21,108","00:17:23,377","-Thank you, sir. Appreciate it.
-Yes, sir. Thank you."
350,"00:17:23,511","00:17:25,513","First thing
you learn in this job,"
351,"00:17:26,179","00:17:28,348",gotta humor the crazies.
352,"00:17:49,604","00:17:50,805",Old Man.
353,"00:18:04,284","00:18:05,553",That's Pandaconda.
354,"00:18:05,687","00:18:07,689","-Half panda, half snake.
-Mm."
355,"00:18:07,822","00:18:10,858","And this one's half platypus,
half possum."
356,"00:18:10,992","00:18:12,827",A Platypossum. Genius.
357,"00:18:12,961","00:18:14,562",Because a platypus
358,"00:18:14,696","00:18:17,497","is basically already an animal
mashup anyway. So, you know..."
359,"00:18:17,632","00:18:20,167","You get more bang for your buck.
Thank you."
360,"00:18:20,300","00:18:21,636",Yeah.
361,"00:18:22,870","00:18:24,005",This one's Carl.
362,"00:18:24,137","00:18:25,773","Well, you captured
him perfectly."
363,"00:18:25,907","00:18:27,809","I handed that one in
for art class,"
364,"00:18:27,942","00:18:29,077","and I got an ""unsatisfactory."""
365,"00:18:29,209","00:18:30,778","Clearly some people
have no vision."
366,"00:18:30,912","00:18:34,247","I really wanted a dog,
but I'm allergic,"
367,"00:18:34,381","00:18:35,917",so Dad got me Carl.
368,"00:18:36,050","00:18:39,319","And we used to play
with him all the time. Mom too."
369,"00:18:40,253","00:18:43,524",But that was before my dad died.
370,"00:18:44,692","00:18:45,693",Oh.
371,"00:18:46,393","00:18:49,229","And, um, by ""died"" you mean..."
372,"00:18:50,765","00:18:52,432",Stopped living.
373,"00:18:54,869","00:18:56,738","Oh, right, right. Right."
374,"00:18:57,672","00:18:59,574",Now Mom's always stressed out
375,"00:19:00,407","00:19:01,676",and I wish...
376,"00:19:02,309","00:19:03,578",You wish what?
377,"00:19:04,846","00:19:07,882","I don't know, I just want her
to be happy, you know?"
378,"00:19:08,549","00:19:10,417",Like she used to be.
379,"00:19:10,551","00:19:11,953","Well, maybe I can help."
380,"00:19:12,754","00:19:14,287",Maybe we could help each other.
381,"00:19:14,421","00:19:16,256","Yeah, like,
you make my mom happy,"
382,"00:19:16,390","00:19:18,593",and I'll help you find your dad.
383,"00:19:19,594","00:19:20,327",Deal.
384,"00:19:20,460","00:19:22,329",Oh.
385,"00:19:22,764","00:19:23,497",What? Oh.
386,"00:19:27,635","00:19:31,139","So how did you make that tire?
I really gotta know."
387,"00:19:36,376","00:19:37,712",With this.
388,"00:19:49,356","00:19:50,792",Here. Now you try.
389,"00:19:52,593","00:19:54,194","-Seriously?
-Mm-hmm."
390,"00:19:54,327","00:19:55,530",How does it work?
391,"00:19:56,597","00:19:58,365","I've never really
thought about it."
392,"00:19:58,498","00:19:59,701",The Old Man gave it to me
393,"00:19:59,834","00:20:01,869","so I just always believed
that it would."
394,"00:20:08,475","00:20:09,677",What is this?
395,"00:20:17,384","00:20:19,087",That's Spiderfly.
396,"00:20:19,252","00:20:20,555","Now, that is creative."
397,"00:20:23,356","00:20:24,491",And terrifying.
398,"00:20:24,625","00:20:26,928","-That's terrifying.
-Yeah. Here."
399,"00:20:27,061","00:20:28,730",Thank-- We should prob-- Okay.
400,"00:20:28,863","00:20:30,131",Run!
401,"00:20:30,263","00:20:31,999","Mel, look out. I think I'm just
gonna sneak out of here."
402,"00:20:32,133","00:20:34,301","-It's poisonous.
-Why did you make it poisonous?"
403,"00:20:35,737","00:20:36,871",Harold?
404,"00:20:38,106","00:20:39,439",It's cold.
405,"00:20:40,440","00:20:42,643",I need you to draw me a jacket.
406,"00:20:43,443","00:20:45,012",Purple!
407,"00:20:46,581","00:20:49,282",He's been here.
408,"00:20:56,157","00:20:58,325","Aw. Hey, friend."
409,"00:21:10,138","00:21:11,873","Wow, this is real power."
410,"00:21:17,812","00:21:18,846",Hmm.
411,"00:21:19,947","00:21:21,314",That'll do.
412,"00:21:27,420","00:21:29,023","Hello, beautiful."
413,"00:21:32,260","00:21:34,929","Hey, whoever's down there,
I called the cops."
414,"00:21:35,062","00:21:36,030",They're on their way.
415,"00:22:06,060","00:22:07,394",What was that?
416,"00:22:16,469","00:22:18,005",We have it every day.
417,"00:22:18,139","00:22:20,340",The best ever.
418,"00:22:23,277","00:22:24,812","Oh, good morning, Terry!"
419,"00:22:25,746","00:22:27,615",Where'd those pies come from?
420,"00:22:27,748","00:22:29,317",Harold made them.
421,"00:22:29,449","00:22:32,186","Okay, well,
pies are not breakfast."
422,"00:22:32,320","00:22:34,288","I'mma pretend I didn't hear
what you just said."
423,"00:22:34,421","00:22:36,824","Pie is definitely
breakfast. Right."
424,"00:22:36,958","00:22:38,125",Okay.
425,"00:22:42,395","00:22:44,031",My house is purple.
426,"00:22:44,165","00:22:45,700","Oh, yeah-yeah, yeah."
427,"00:22:45,833","00:22:49,070","Well, you said it needed
some new paint,"
428,"00:22:49,203","00:22:50,972","so I thought I would make it
more cheerful"
429,"00:22:51,105","00:22:53,241","and then you wouldn't be
so unhappy all the time."
430,"00:22:53,373","00:22:54,642","Mom, Harold can do magic."
431,"00:22:54,775","00:22:56,911",He can literally make anything.
432,"00:22:57,044","00:23:01,414","Uh, I wouldn't call it magic,
per se. It's more of a science."
433,"00:23:01,549","00:23:03,117","I've been trying
to keep it a secret,"
434,"00:23:03,251","00:23:04,585","but with this little guy,"
435,"00:23:04,719","00:23:06,520","I can basically make
whatever I want."
436,"00:23:06,654","00:23:08,890","Okay, can we talk for a sec?"
437,"00:23:09,023","00:23:11,859","Okay. Um,
I'm already dealing with,"
438,"00:23:11,993","00:23:14,128","like, an imaginary
dragon-lizard-lion"
439,"00:23:14,262","00:23:15,428","situation right now,"
440,"00:23:15,563","00:23:17,732","so can we not do
magic crayons, please?"
441,"00:23:19,767","00:23:21,969","Yeah. Yeah, yeah.
No, sure, Terry."
442,"00:23:22,103","00:23:23,170",Okay. Great.
443,"00:23:23,304","00:23:24,805","I need to help Harold
look for his dad."
444,"00:23:24,939","00:23:26,507","Oh, no.
You need to go to school."
445,"00:23:26,641","00:23:27,842",And I need to go to work.
446,"00:23:27,975","00:23:31,279","And these guys gotta go.
They gotta go."
447,"00:23:31,411","00:23:34,348","Okay? Time to stop eating pie.
We all have to leave."
448,"00:23:34,481","00:23:36,449",No more pie. Say bye.
449,"00:23:36,584","00:23:37,919","Hey, Mel."
450,"00:23:46,127","00:23:48,029","-Really?
-Yeah."
451,"00:23:48,495","00:23:49,664",Thanks.
452,"00:23:50,430","00:23:52,033","Bye, Mel. Have a good day."
453,"00:23:52,166","00:23:54,368","-Thank you, Terry.
-Yep."
454,"00:23:54,502","00:23:55,937","-Bye.
-Bye."
455,"00:23:56,938","00:23:58,706","All right,
let's find your dad."
456,"00:23:58,839","00:24:00,541","Wait, don't you have to
go to school?"
457,"00:24:00,675","00:24:01,842",I am going to school.
458,"00:24:01,976","00:24:04,812","Just by a super-long
indirect way."
459,"00:24:04,946","00:24:06,747","-Thanks, Mel.
-Yeah."
460,"00:24:07,648","00:24:10,017",Wish we had more of that pie.
461,"00:24:10,151","00:24:11,619","Yeah, no. No, no, no."
462,"00:24:11,752","00:24:13,554","Listen, we gotta respect
your mom's rules."
463,"00:24:13,688","00:24:15,056",No more pie.8
464,"00:24:15,756","00:24:17,925","Harold, you are a genius."
465,"00:24:18,059","00:24:20,227","-This is way better than pies.
-Yeah."
466,"00:24:21,494","00:24:24,065","Look, if we're gonna find
your dad, we need a plan."
467,"00:24:24,198","00:24:25,633",I'm way ahead of you.
468,"00:24:25,766","00:24:27,001","We're just gonna walk around,
looking for old men."
469,"00:24:27,134","00:24:28,836",How hard could that be?
470,"00:24:31,973","00:24:32,773",What?
471,"00:24:32,907","00:24:34,342","-Old Man!
-No, that's--"
472,"00:24:34,474","00:24:36,444",Old Man! It's me! It's Harold!
473,"00:24:37,645","00:24:39,981","Who you calling old, punk!"
474,"00:24:40,114","00:24:41,315","Sorry, Mr. Perez."
475,"00:24:41,449","00:24:45,586","Oh, this is gonna be
a lot harder than I thought."
476,"00:24:45,720","00:24:47,922","Maybe we need
to come up with a better plan."
477,"00:24:52,093","00:24:54,595","""Place to go
when you need to know anything""?"
478,"00:24:54,729","00:24:55,997","That's it, that's what we do."
479,"00:24:56,130","00:24:58,466","The library,
it's kind of a long walk."
480,"00:24:58,599","00:24:59,867","""Walk""? Who said walk?"
481,"00:25:09,744","00:25:11,545","Wait, guys! Wait for me!"

the hang of it!"
485,"00:25:18,252","00:25:19,520","No, I don't! Aah!"
486,"00:25:23,524","00:25:25,760","No, wait!"
487,"00:25:27,194","00:25:28,195","Oh, yeah."
488,"00:25:34,802","00:25:36,637","Whoa, whoa..."
489,"00:25:37,638","00:25:38,839",Let's go!

491,"00:25:52,920","00:25:55,289","-Ugh.
-What's wrong?"
492,"00:25:55,823","00:25:57,024",You'll see.

542,"00:28:03,317","00:28:04,619","But that's because
we stayed the night."

a lot of each other, so..."
545,"00:28:08,789","00:28:10,357",But that's not why we're here.

need your help, Library Gary."
547,"00:28:12,793","00:28:16,130","I'm really trying
to find my old man."
548,"00:28:16,263","00:28:19,466","We're a library.
We don't do missing persons."
549,"00:28:20,569","00:28:21,835",My mom always talks

information about anything."
553,"00:28:27,509","00:28:28,610",She said that?
554,"00:28:28,742","00:28:30,711","Well, sorry, Harold."
555,"00:28:30,844","00:28:32,681",Gary can't do it.
556,"00:28:32,813","00:28:35,316",My mom will be so disappointed.

what's your dad's name?"

562,"00:28:47,962","00:28:49,564",I really don't know. Um...
563,"00:28:49,698","00:28:50,931","But I know he's an old man,"
564,"00:28:51,065","00:28:52,800","and I know
that he's in the Real World."
565,"00:28:53,867","00:28:55,069",Okay.

573,"00:29:08,583","00:29:09,618",And he talks like this.

into the mainframe."
575,"00:29:13,688","00:29:14,989",And clackity-clack-clack.

that if this is all you've got,"
579,"00:29:20,961","00:29:22,296",you're never gonna find him.
580,"00:29:24,298","00:29:25,533",Unless...
581,"00:29:26,367","00:29:27,535",Unless...
582,"00:29:28,570","00:29:29,537",he finds us.
583,"00:29:29,671","00:29:30,838",Exactly!
584,"00:29:30,971","00:29:32,439",Which is gonna be difficult
585,"00:29:32,574","00:29:35,142","because he doesn't know
that we're looking for him."
586,"00:29:35,276","00:29:36,343",Unless...
587,"00:29:37,746","00:29:39,079",Unless...
588,"00:29:44,151","00:29:46,253","-What?
-I don't know. That's-- I was--"
589,"00:29:46,387","00:29:48,889","Maybe you could fly in the air
in a little plane"
590,"00:29:49,023","00:29:51,959","and write messages to him
in the sky."
591,"00:29:54,461","00:29:57,831","And that's why you
ask a librarian. Genius."
592,"00:29:57,965","00:29:59,099",Let's go have some fun.
593,"00:29:59,233","00:30:01,035","-Yes.
-Purple crayon."
594,"00:30:01,168","00:30:02,570","It's kind of my thing, so..."
595,"00:30:02,704","00:30:03,638",Cute.
596,"00:30:03,772","00:30:05,139",Thank you for your help.
597,"00:30:26,561","00:30:27,662",Whoa.
598,"00:30:27,796","00:30:29,631","Yes, well, unfortunately,"
599,"00:30:29,764","00:30:33,200","we've decided to pass
on The Glaive of..."
600,"00:30:33,334","00:30:35,269","-G'Garaur.
-Whatever."
601,"00:30:35,402","00:30:37,739",G'Garaur. It's not that hard.
602,"00:30:37,871","00:30:39,006",It is hard.
603,"00:30:39,139","00:30:40,374",You don't want a book
604,"00:30:40,508","00:30:42,209","where people can't even
say the title."
605,"00:30:42,343","00:30:45,580","You're just like all the others,
Yasmin. You don't get it."
606,"00:30:45,714","00:30:47,147",My world is bigger
607,"00:30:47,281","00:30:51,485","than Hogwarts and Middle-earth
and Narnia combined."
608,"00:30:51,619","00:30:53,053",Okay.
609,"00:30:55,456","00:30:56,890",Don't know what that means.
610,"00:30:57,024","00:30:58,626","It means,
""Thank you for your time."
611,"00:30:58,760","00:31:00,861","""I hope you reconsider."""
612,"00:31:16,009","00:31:17,111",Ta-da!
613,"00:31:17,244","00:31:21,281",Harold and the Purple Crayon.
614,"00:31:24,952","00:31:26,588",Anybody ever heard the term
615,"00:31:26,721","00:31:28,188","""when a moose flies""?"
616,"00:31:28,322","00:31:32,126","No! 'Cause moose don't fly.
I am a land animal."
617,"00:31:32,259","00:31:34,962","Statistically,
planes are safer than cars."
618,"00:31:35,095","00:31:37,131","What about a plane
drawn by Harold?"
619,"00:31:38,132","00:31:41,301","-It's gonna be great.
-It's gonna be great."
620,"00:31:41,435","00:31:43,805","Statistically,
what does that mean?"
621,"00:31:43,937","00:31:48,442","""Harold left a very hungry moose
and a deserving porcupine..."""
622,"00:31:49,878","00:31:51,011",Hey!
623,"00:31:51,145","00:31:53,480","Quiet, please.
This is a library."
624,"00:31:55,416","00:31:59,453","With that crayon,
I can show them my world."
625,"00:32:08,630","00:32:10,998","Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
Watch out, red light!"
626,"00:32:11,131","00:32:12,499",Oh!
627,"00:32:15,135","00:32:17,806",This is awesome!
628,"00:32:17,938","00:32:19,808","-Whoo!
-Look out!"
629,"00:32:19,940","00:32:21,676",What? I can't--
630,"00:32:21,810","00:32:23,444","Actually, hold on a second."
631,"00:32:25,012","00:32:26,280",Whoa.
632,"00:32:31,786","00:32:34,087","Sorry about that.
What were you saying?"
633,"00:32:34,221","00:32:35,757","I said, ""Look out!"""
634,"00:32:35,890","00:32:37,157",Oh.
635,"00:32:38,593","00:32:40,695","That was close, huh?"
636,"00:32:44,566","00:32:46,467",We should leave a phone number.
637,"00:32:46,601","00:32:49,002","But my mom says that I can't
give my number to strangers."
638,"00:32:49,136","00:32:52,072","She didn't say you couldn't
give her number to strangers."
639,"00:33:01,081","00:33:03,518",Mmh-mmh.
640,"00:33:12,326","00:33:13,795",It's working!
641,"00:33:14,562","00:33:18,265",Woo-hoo!
642,"00:33:40,120","00:33:41,656",Harold!
643,"00:33:41,789","00:33:44,057","Ooh.
Sorry, Moose. Sorry!"
644,"00:33:47,060","00:33:49,831","Harold! Get me out
the air! Land this thing!"
645,"00:33:49,964","00:33:51,398",That's not nearly as fun.
646,"00:33:51,533","00:33:53,100",Hang on!
647,"00:33:56,738","00:33:58,138",Yeah!
648,"00:33:59,373","00:34:01,408",See? Now that is fun.
649,"00:34:01,543","00:34:02,877","Look, that's my school."
650,"00:34:03,011","00:34:05,312","All right!
Let's get you down there."
651,"00:34:08,181","00:34:11,118","It looks like it's gonna be
another perfect landing, folks."
652,"00:34:11,251","00:34:13,487","So just sit back, relax and--"
653,"00:34:13,621","00:34:15,122","-Oh!
-Whoa, whoa..."
654,"00:34:18,826","00:34:20,628","I can't believe
we're still rolling."
655,"00:34:20,762","00:34:22,897","I feel like
I'm in a washing machine."
656,"00:34:25,934","00:34:27,635",Maybe pie isn't breakfast.
657,"00:34:35,108","00:34:36,644",We gotta do that again.
658,"00:34:38,046","00:34:39,246","Oh, hey!"
659,"00:34:39,379","00:34:42,115","-All right.
-Whoa."
660,"00:34:42,249","00:34:43,918","Well, good luck
finding your old man."
661,"00:34:44,052","00:34:46,386",Thanks. Have fun at school.
662,"00:34:49,657","00:34:51,926","-Huh. Look at this.
-Hmm?"
663,"00:34:56,698","00:34:57,665",Hello.
664,"00:34:57,799","00:34:59,867","Hey. I saw your number
in the sky."
665,"00:35:00,001","00:35:01,069",What?
666,"00:35:01,201","00:35:02,570",I figured it was a sign.
667,"00:35:02,704","00:35:04,572","I'm sorry, I don't know
what you're talking about."
668,"00:35:04,706","00:35:06,708","I could be your old man
if you'll be my old lady."
669,"00:35:06,841","00:35:09,544","I think you have
the wrong number. Okay?"
670,"00:35:09,677","00:35:11,378","-Hello?
-Hello?"
671,"00:35:11,512","00:35:13,180","-Hello?
-Hello?"
672,"00:35:13,313","00:35:16,316","Yeah, uh, I got your message
in the sky."
673,"00:35:16,450","00:35:18,620",Let me guess. You're an old man.
674,"00:35:18,753","00:35:19,687",Yeah.
675,"00:35:19,821","00:35:21,856","-Hello?
-Hello?"
676,"00:35:21,990","00:35:23,323","-Hello?
-Hello?"
677,"00:35:23,457","00:35:24,959","How old of a guy
are you looking for?"
678,"00:35:25,093","00:35:27,562","-Is this some kind of joke?
-No, no, no."
679,"00:35:27,695","00:35:29,329","You left me a message
in the sky."
680,"00:35:29,463","00:35:30,798",That wasn't me. So...
681,"00:35:30,932","00:35:32,132",I can't hear you.
682,"00:35:32,265","00:35:34,201",Hello? Hello?
683,"00:35:34,334","00:35:35,637",Please stop calling me.
684,"00:35:52,820","00:35:55,255","-You're late, Melvin.
-Where've you been, weirdo?"
685,"00:35:55,389","00:35:56,423","-Give me this.
-Stop."
686,"00:35:56,557","00:35:58,526","-Where you goin'?
-Let go of me!"
687,"00:35:58,660","00:36:00,928",Bro.
688,"00:36:01,062","00:36:03,230",You just hit my bro.
689,"00:36:03,363","00:36:06,166","What's with the noise?
What's going on?"
690,"00:36:06,299","00:36:08,335","Principal's office, now."
691,"00:36:12,874","00:36:14,174",There it is.
692,"00:36:15,208","00:36:17,244",The store that sells everything.
693,"00:36:17,377","00:36:19,714","Come on, let's go find Terry."
694,"00:36:21,983","00:36:24,686","Oh, Moose! Miniature train ride!"
695,"00:36:25,119","00:36:26,087","No, Moose!"
696,"00:36:28,523","00:36:30,525","What?
What are you doin', man?"
697,"00:36:30,658","00:36:34,327","-Wow.
-Whoa!"
698,"00:36:35,163","00:36:37,330",This place is next level!
699,"00:36:39,133","00:36:41,903",Wow!
700,"00:36:43,437","00:36:45,173",This place has everything!
701,"00:36:45,305","00:36:47,508",Cheese... balls?
702,"00:36:47,642","00:36:50,444","It's like cheese, but puffier."
703,"00:36:50,578","00:36:52,847","Wow. Oh,
and they have these things!"
704,"00:36:52,980","00:36:54,148",Whatever these are.
705,"00:36:54,281","00:36:56,784","Like scarves,
but soft and heavy."
706,"00:36:56,918","00:36:58,920",Customer needs assistance
707,"00:36:59,053","00:37:01,789","-in macrame supplies.
-They have their own narrator."
708,"00:37:01,923","00:37:04,458","...into a night
of terror for a local couple."
709,"00:37:04,592","00:37:06,828","Police are looking
for this woman."
710,"00:37:06,961","00:37:09,463","Authorities say the
still-unidentified suspect..."
711,"00:37:09,597","00:37:11,364",Hello?
712,"00:37:11,498","00:37:15,203","Hi. I'm old. I'm, like, 40."
713,"00:37:15,335","00:37:17,237","Okay. Can I talk
to your mom, please?"
714,"00:37:17,370","00:37:19,372",And I just pooped my pants.
715,"00:37:23,144","00:37:24,912",Terry.
716,"00:37:25,046","00:37:27,882","What did we say
about personal calls?"
717,"00:37:28,015","00:37:29,316","Oh, it was a wrong num--"
718,"00:37:29,449","00:37:31,418","I've had like
600 wrong numbers today, sorry."
719,"00:37:31,552","00:37:33,087","Terry, I started out
just like you,"
720,"00:37:33,221","00:37:34,287",busting my hump on the floor.
721,"00:37:34,421","00:37:35,623",Right.
722,"00:37:35,757","00:37:37,892",But 12 years later...
723,"00:37:42,262","00:37:43,430","-I'm a manager.
-Manager."
724,"00:37:43,564","00:37:45,633","-Okay? Dreams do come true.
-Yep."
725,"00:37:45,767","00:37:47,635","-But you have to work for them.
-Right."
726,"00:37:47,769","00:37:49,504","-I have an opportunity for you.
-Mm-hmm."
727,"00:37:49,637","00:37:51,139",I've got a backlogged stockroom.
728,"00:37:51,271","00:37:54,108","This could be your moment.
Are you ready to take your shot?"
729,"00:37:54,242","00:37:57,377","-You just try and stop me.
-Great."
730,"00:37:57,512","00:37:59,279","-This is your last warning.
-Okay."
731,"00:37:59,412","00:38:00,413",Great.
732,"00:38:00,548","00:38:02,415","-Good luck.
-Thank you."
733,"00:38:02,917","00:38:03,885",'Kay.
734,"00:38:04,585","00:38:09,824","Oh, wow!"
735,"00:38:13,060","00:38:14,896",Feels so good.
736,"00:38:15,029","00:38:17,865",So good.
737,"00:38:19,332","00:38:20,668",What are you guys doing here?
738,"00:38:20,802","00:38:23,037","Hi, Terry.
Hey, did my old man call yet?"
739,"00:38:23,171","00:38:26,741","Oh, no.
Your old man has not called."
740,"00:38:26,874","00:38:28,009",Oh.
741,"00:38:28,142","00:38:30,377","But old men are calling me
every 15 seconds."
742,"00:38:30,511","00:38:32,747","Do you have something
to do with that?"
743,"00:38:32,880","00:38:34,682","You guys gotta
get out of here, okay?"
744,"00:38:34,816","00:38:36,416",I'm this close to losing my job.
745,"00:38:36,551","00:38:38,252","Oh, congrats.
You hated this job."
746,"00:38:38,385","00:38:40,087","No, I love this job.
Hey, Prasad."
747,"00:38:40,822","00:38:43,057","Okay, well, I am very confused."
748,"00:38:44,457","00:38:46,194","Will you idiots
stop calling me?"
749,"00:38:46,326","00:38:48,229",Terry? It's Principal Brady.
750,"00:38:48,361","00:38:50,330","-Principal Brady? Hi.
-Yes."
751,"00:38:50,463","00:38:51,799",Your son Melvin
752,"00:38:51,933","00:38:53,366","has been involved
in an incident in school."
753,"00:38:53,500","00:38:54,569","-What?
-He's okay."
754,"00:38:54,702","00:38:55,870",But I'm afraid we're gonna
755,"00:38:56,003","00:38:57,538","have to send him
home for the day."
756,"00:38:57,672","00:39:01,209","Yeah, no, sorry.
I'll be right there. Okay, bye."
757,"00:39:01,341","00:39:03,010","Okay, Mel's in trouble
at school,"
758,"00:39:03,144","00:39:05,646","but I'm gonna lose my job
if I miss this shift."
759,"00:39:06,647","00:39:09,183","-When people need help, we help.
-Right."
760,"00:39:09,317","00:39:10,785","You know
who I learned that from?"
761,"00:39:10,918","00:39:12,787","From a lady
who hit us with her car."
762,"00:39:12,920","00:39:13,754",Mm-hmm.
763,"00:39:13,888","00:39:15,590",Do you know who that lady is?
764,"00:39:17,390","00:39:18,960","-You.
-Me."
765,"00:39:21,428","00:39:22,830",This is the stockroom.
766,"00:39:26,067","00:39:29,337","So you take the boxes,
you look at the label,"
767,"00:39:29,469","00:39:31,739","and you put them
on the right shelf."
768,"00:39:32,840","00:39:34,441","Piece of cake, right?"
769,"00:39:34,575","00:39:37,111","I'll be back in an hour.
Thank you."
770,"00:39:40,815","00:39:43,851","-See? Piece of cake.
-Mm."
771,"00:39:49,090","00:39:52,059","I can't take it anymore.
This is soul-crushing."
772,"00:39:52,193","00:39:55,696","Oh, God. Having a job in
the Real World is so terrible."
773,"00:39:55,830","00:39:58,465","I wouldn't get a job. Why would
anybody wanna get a job?"
774,"00:39:58,599","00:40:01,235","I don't know. How long
have we been doing this?"
775,"00:40:01,369","00:40:02,603","-Six minutes!
-Aah!"
776,"00:40:11,245","00:40:12,647",What happened?
777,"00:40:12,780","00:40:15,415","You're not the kind of kid
who gets into fights."
778,"00:40:15,549","00:40:16,751",It was an accident.
779,"00:40:16,884","00:40:18,619",They tried to take my whistle.
780,"00:40:18,753","00:40:21,722","Okay. Well, I think
you should forget about Carl"
781,"00:40:21,856","00:40:24,592","and start making
real friends. Okay?"
782,"00:40:25,259","00:40:26,560",Harold believes in Carl.
783,"00:40:26,694","00:40:28,996","Well, maybe
we shouldn't take life advice"
784,"00:40:29,130","00:40:31,933","from a person
that does crayon magic."
785,"00:40:33,301","00:40:34,735",We are here to help.
786,"00:40:34,869","00:40:36,837","Do you need-- Nope,
you don't need any help. Okay."
787,"00:40:36,971","00:40:39,439","Come on, Moose.
This'll be way more fun."
788,"00:40:43,611","00:40:45,646",Whoa!
789,"00:40:45,780","00:40:47,515",Apples to zesters
790,"00:40:47,648","00:40:48,616",and everything in between.
791,"00:40:48,749","00:40:51,218",Ollie's is here for your needs.
792,"00:40:51,819","00:40:53,854",I look glorious.
793,"00:40:53,988","00:40:56,891","Oh, how I miss my antlers."
794,"00:40:57,024","00:40:59,327",Cashier to checkout 7.
795,"00:40:59,459","00:41:00,594",Cashier to checkout...
796,"00:41:02,462","00:41:04,899",Chewing sounds.
797,"00:41:10,972","00:41:12,406",Oh...
798,"00:41:15,475","00:41:16,777",Uh...
799,"00:41:17,278","00:41:19,613",Whoa. Whoa...
800,"00:41:19,747","00:41:22,450","Ah, perfect.
Hey, do you guys sell Pumas?"
801,"00:41:22,583","00:41:25,853","Uh, you know, I'm not sure.
But shouldn't be a problem."
802,"00:41:25,987","00:41:27,254",Fly!
803,"00:41:27,388","00:41:29,489","Fly, fly!"
804,"00:41:36,163","00:41:37,164",Enjoy!
805,"00:41:38,165","00:41:41,602","I am getting
really good at this!"
806,"00:41:42,103","00:41:43,938",Fly! Fly!
807,"00:41:44,605","00:41:46,240",Whoa!
808,"00:41:46,374","00:41:48,275","-This is insane!
-Oh, Shawn!"
809,"00:41:48,409","00:41:51,012","-Honey! Shawn, honey!
-Whoa!"
810,"00:41:52,079","00:41:54,949",I'm flying!
811,"00:41:58,252","00:41:59,920",Awesome!
812,"00:42:00,054","00:42:01,122",Oh!
813,"00:42:05,726","00:42:07,828",Whoa...
814,"00:42:13,734","00:42:15,736","This is fun, Mom!"
815,"00:42:17,004","00:42:18,005",Whoa!
816,"00:42:53,841","00:42:56,010","Hurry up.
Please evacuate the building."
817,"00:42:56,143","00:42:59,113","I'm gonna sue you.
And I'm taking these bowls."
818,"00:43:00,714","00:43:03,184","-But, Mom, I wanna do it again.
-Shh!"
819,"00:43:03,651","00:43:06,087","But, Mom!"
820,"00:43:06,220","00:43:09,023","How did you even do this?
I actually wanna know."
821,"00:43:09,156","00:43:11,692","-That's a valid question.
-Yeah. I--"
822,"00:43:11,826","00:43:14,995","Do not say anything
about magic crayons."
823,"00:43:15,963","00:43:17,331",What were you thinking?
824,"00:43:17,465","00:43:19,166","Oh, honestly, I don't do
a lot of thinking."
825,"00:43:19,300","00:43:21,469","-I'm more of an improv guy.
-True."
826,"00:43:21,602","00:43:22,870","Good news, Terry."
827,"00:43:23,003","00:43:24,638","Police are all over
the security tapes."
828,"00:43:24,772","00:43:27,842","They'll find out who did this,
and when they do..."
829,"00:43:27,975","00:43:29,810",...it will not be pretty.
830,"00:43:30,579","00:43:31,879",Who are you guys?
831,"00:43:32,012","00:43:33,414","We're friends of Terry's,
just filling in."
832,"00:43:33,548","00:43:37,017","But I gotta be honest,
your job is super boring."
833,"00:43:37,151","00:43:38,819",No wonder you hate it so much.
834,"00:43:45,025","00:43:48,028","You do sell pumas, right?
I wasn't wrong about that?"
835,"00:43:51,065","00:43:52,867","We're really, really sorry.
Is there..."
836,"00:43:53,000","00:43:54,935","Yeah, is there anything
we can do?"
837,"00:43:55,069","00:43:57,938","You guys have done plenty.
I think you can stop."
838,"00:44:00,007","00:44:03,177","Mom, you did ask them to help.
They did their best."
839,"00:44:03,844","00:44:05,646","Besides, you hated that job."
840,"00:44:05,779","00:44:07,948","I'm just saying,
maybe now you can find something"
841,"00:44:08,082","00:44:09,717",that makes you happy.
842,"00:44:12,453","00:44:13,921",Please?
843,"00:44:14,922","00:44:17,725","I did always
wanna trash that place."
844,"00:44:19,226","00:44:20,261",Okay.
845,"00:44:20,728","00:44:21,996",Come on.
846,"00:44:28,202","00:44:30,605","You ever look at your life
and go,"
847,"00:44:30,738","00:44:32,139","""How'd I end up here?"""
848,"00:44:32,273","00:44:34,576","I'm asking myself
that question right now."
849,"00:44:34,708","00:44:37,311","Yeah, I thought I was
gonna be a concert pianist."
850,"00:44:37,444","00:44:38,879",Wait a second.
851,"00:44:39,013","00:44:40,181","Maybe working at Ollie's
wasn't your true passion."
852,"00:44:40,314","00:44:41,516",Ya think?
853,"00:44:41,650","00:44:44,418","Terry, you need to play piano.
It's who you are."
854,"00:44:44,553","00:44:48,557","I don't know, I haven't really
played since my husband died."
855,"00:44:48,689","00:44:49,990",I'm a little rusty.
856,"00:44:51,225","00:44:52,293",Ice cream truck.
857,"00:44:52,426","00:44:55,029","Ice cream truck.
We love ice cream, don't we?"
858,"00:44:55,796","00:44:58,699","Yeah, yeah, we love ice cream."
859,"00:44:58,832","00:45:00,801","Ice cream sounds great.
Let's go. Let's go."
860,"00:45:00,935","00:45:02,903","Let's get this ice cream.
Come on, Terry."
861,"00:45:03,037","00:45:04,905",I don't like it that much.
862,"00:45:22,489","00:45:23,724",Um...
863,"00:45:24,458","00:45:25,859",How did-- You know what?
864,"00:45:25,993","00:45:29,096","I'm not even gonna ask anymore.
This is incredible."
865,"00:45:29,230","00:45:30,297",I mean...
866,"00:45:30,431","00:45:32,266","Play for us, please."
867,"00:45:33,000","00:45:34,536",I don't do that anymore.
868,"00:45:34,669","00:45:37,838","Come on, Mom.
You haven't played for so long."
869,"00:45:37,972","00:45:40,140","Dad and I used to love it.
Please?"
870,"00:46:08,637","00:46:11,640","Do these guys
look like criminals to you?"
871,"00:46:13,007","00:46:14,775",They look like morons.
872,"00:46:14,908","00:46:16,578",There's something more to this.
873,"00:46:16,711","00:46:18,012",I have witnesses saying
874,"00:46:18,145","00:46:20,014","they saw him
making things out of thin air."
875,"00:46:20,147","00:46:22,416",You gotta humor the crazies.
876,"00:46:24,719","00:46:28,289","Ah. Harold. What a trail of
clues you have left."
877,"00:46:39,366","00:46:40,401",Harold?
878,"00:46:42,903","00:46:43,904","-Harold?
-Mmh-mmh."
879,"00:46:45,839","00:46:47,107",Harold?
880,"00:46:47,742","00:46:49,544",Miss? Can I help you?
881,"00:46:50,844","00:46:52,012",Yes!
882,"00:46:52,146","00:46:53,947","Thank God
someone's offering help."
883,"00:46:54,081","00:46:55,249",I was beginning to think
884,"00:46:55,382","00:46:57,251","the Real World
was full of meanies."
885,"00:46:57,384","00:47:00,755","Don't do that.
Crayons are for paper, sweetie."
886,"00:47:00,888","00:47:02,956",Uh...
887,"00:47:03,090","00:47:04,358","Sorry, what did you just say?"
888,"00:47:04,491","00:47:06,894","She can't just draw
wherever she wants."
889,"00:47:07,027","00:47:09,897","Well, you have no idea
what that could've been."
890,"00:47:10,030","00:47:11,465","Don't listen to her, mate."
891,"00:47:11,599","00:47:14,101","Crayons aren't just for paper.
They are for everywhere."
892,"00:47:14,234","00:47:16,103","I can't wait to see
what you make."
893,"00:47:16,236","00:47:17,438","If you aren't here to eat,"
894,"00:47:17,572","00:47:19,406","I'm gonna have to
ask you to leave."
895,"00:47:22,042","00:47:23,310","Oh, I'll eat."
896,"00:47:33,187","00:47:35,155",You're gonna have to leave now.
897,"00:47:39,326","00:47:40,461",Hey!
898,"00:47:54,375","00:47:56,711","I'm telling you,
this is all connected."
899,"00:48:04,918","00:48:06,220",That's her!
900,"00:48:08,723","00:48:10,958",You! Get back here!
901,"00:48:51,999","00:48:53,500",So good!
902,"00:48:53,635","00:48:56,403","No, that was all her.
Well, I mean, I made the piano."
903,"00:48:56,538","00:48:58,740","-Harold, Moose, hi.
-Oh, hi."
904,"00:48:58,873","00:49:01,241","-Oh, Terry.
-Hi, Gary."
905,"00:49:01,375","00:49:03,912","Your music was a golden elixir,"
906,"00:49:04,044","00:49:06,447","and I drank
until I was intoxicated."
907,"00:49:06,947","00:49:08,516","Did you, now?"
908,"00:49:09,016","00:49:10,217","Thanks, Gary."
909,"00:49:10,350","00:49:12,352","Harold, I have wonderful news."
910,"00:49:12,486","00:49:14,622","I think I know
who your old man is."
911,"00:49:14,756","00:49:17,191","You know who my-- You do?
He does!"
912,"00:49:17,324","00:49:18,893","Oh, Gary, you're the best."
913,"00:49:19,026","00:49:20,327","It'll take some explaining,"
914,"00:49:20,461","00:49:21,930","so follow me
and I'll tell you everything."
915,"00:49:22,062","00:49:23,731",Okay. Okay.
916,"00:49:23,865","00:49:25,199",W-W-Wait.
917,"00:49:25,332","00:49:27,201","Why do you wanna
help them all of a sudden?"
918,"00:49:27,334","00:49:29,069",I'm a nice person.
919,"00:49:29,203","00:49:30,270","Well, I'm coming, too."
920,"00:49:30,404","00:49:31,972","No, no, no, no, honey."
921,"00:49:32,105","00:49:33,541","You've had enough excitement
for one day. We gotta go home."
922,"00:49:33,675","00:49:35,743","Yes, Mel,
I think it's past your bedtime."
923,"00:49:35,877","00:49:36,911",What a wonderful boy.
924,"00:49:37,044","00:49:38,278",Thank you.
925,"00:49:38,412","00:49:42,216","He could use
a father figure, perhaps."
926,"00:49:43,150","00:49:45,520","Um, okay.
Are you sure you're all right?"
927,"00:49:45,653","00:49:47,655","Terry, you've done
more than enough."
928,"00:49:47,789","00:49:49,089",Let Gary carry this burden.
929,"00:49:49,223","00:49:51,291",I know exactly what to do.
930,"00:49:51,960","00:49:53,494",He knows exactly what to do!
931,"00:49:54,662","00:49:55,730",Ready?
932,"00:49:56,731","00:49:58,265","When someone
tells a story,"
933,"00:49:58,398","00:49:59,901",they create a whole world.
934,"00:50:00,033","00:50:02,904","And usually, the characters
stay there in that world."
935,"00:50:03,036","00:50:06,306","What... What are you...
What are you talking about?"
936,"00:50:06,440","00:50:11,613","This is the world
that you come from."
937,"00:50:18,252","00:50:20,788","Moose, that's us.
That's me, that's you."
938,"00:50:20,922","00:50:22,824","Oh, this is incredible."
939,"00:50:23,591","00:50:25,058",It's a whole book about us.
940,"00:50:25,192","00:50:28,061","Do you know
what brought you two to life?"
941,"00:50:28,195","00:50:30,030","It's what your crayon
is made of."
942,"00:50:30,163","00:50:35,168","The most mysterious, powerful,
extraordinary stuff on earth."
943,"00:50:35,737","00:50:36,671",Wax.
944,"00:50:36,804","00:50:38,806",Pure imagination.
945,"00:50:40,875","00:50:43,645","Oh, that is so cool."
946,"00:50:43,778","00:50:46,446","I wanna go home. I miss home.
You know somethin'?"
947,"00:50:46,881","00:50:48,016",I'm goin' in.
948,"00:50:48,148","00:50:49,149",That's...
949,"00:50:49,283","00:50:51,251","Let me in, book.
I wanna go home!"
950,"00:50:52,119","00:50:53,287","I gotta step in it, maybe."
951,"00:50:53,420","00:50:54,622",That's not gonna work.
952,"00:50:54,756","00:50:56,791",And that's a $12 fine.
953,"00:50:56,925","00:50:58,492",Soiling.

The Narrator, Crockett Johnson!"
955,"00:51:03,898","00:51:05,098",This is my old man.
956,"00:51:05,232","00:51:06,801","Moose, we finally
know who it is!"
957,"00:51:13,206","00:51:14,742",Porcupine?
958,"00:51:14,876","00:51:16,410","Porcupine, is that you?"
959,"00:51:16,544","00:51:17,545",Harold?
960,"00:51:17,679","00:51:19,047",Yes! Harold!
961,"00:51:19,179","00:51:21,214",I knew it! I knew I'd find you!
962,"00:51:21,348","00:51:23,618","Oh, my goodness!"
963,"00:51:24,919","00:51:25,853","-Moose?
-Yeah!"
964,"00:51:25,987","00:51:27,220","Porcupine, it's you?"
965,"00:51:27,354","00:51:29,657",Look at you. You in human form.
966,"00:51:29,791","00:51:32,092","I know,
it's so weird!"
967,"00:51:32,225","00:51:33,761",I love having these.
968,"00:51:33,895","00:51:36,096","I'm not really comfortable yet.
I miss my hooves, you know?"
969,"00:51:36,229","00:51:37,665","Yeah, no, I miss my quills."
970,"00:51:37,799","00:51:39,901","It's so good having
the gang back together again."
971,"00:51:40,034","00:51:41,035",I know!
972,"00:51:42,870","00:51:45,305","You are under arrest
for breaking and entering!"
973,"00:51:45,439","00:51:46,608",Is there a problem here?
974,"00:51:46,741","00:51:48,475","That porcupine
is a friend of ours."
975,"00:51:53,681","00:51:56,618","Uh, would it be possible
for me to get my crayon back?"
976,"00:51:57,852","00:51:59,587","Tell y'all somethin',
moose do not belong in jail."
977,"00:51:59,721","00:52:02,289","I really don't like
the Real World at all."
978,"00:52:02,422","00:52:03,891",I just wanna go home so bad.
979,"00:52:04,025","00:52:06,060","Moose, relax. We can fix this.
We just need a plan."
980,"00:52:06,193","00:52:08,730","Whatever the plan is, can you
not leave me behind this time?"
981,"00:52:08,863","00:52:11,599","No, of course not.
Hey, hey. Come here, come here."
982,"00:52:11,733","00:52:14,535","It's Harold and Moose
and Porcupine, okay?"
983,"00:52:14,669","00:52:17,471","We're gonna figure out how to
get our world back together."
984,"00:52:17,605","00:52:20,207","We just gotta
get that crayon first."
985,"00:52:31,052","00:52:32,553",How do you do?
986,"00:52:35,222","00:52:39,027","You cannot keep me up in here!
Keep me locked up in here!"
987,"00:52:39,159","00:52:40,260",Do you know what I am?
988,"00:52:40,394","00:52:41,863",You better get down!
989,"00:52:41,996","00:52:43,931","You're so lucky
you don't have a face full"
990,"00:52:53,908","00:52:56,376","-Hey, what are you doing?
-Whoa, whoa..."
991,"00:53:01,816","00:53:05,153","Come on, come on! Let me in!
Open up! Let me in!"
992,"00:53:05,285","00:53:07,555","Come on, Moose!
Come on, hurry, hurry!"
993,"00:53:09,057","00:53:10,490",You left the door open?
994,"00:53:13,594","00:53:16,764","Okay. How do we
get through that wall? Ooh."
995,"00:53:18,498","00:53:21,401","Yeah!
I can't believe that worked!"
996,"00:53:27,307","00:53:29,577",I need to get some crayons.
997,"00:53:32,446","00:53:33,548","Okay, class."
998,"00:53:33,681","00:53:35,750",Time is up. Pencils down.
999,"00:53:43,591","00:53:45,492",Can I go to the bathroom?
1000,"00:53:48,796","00:53:51,632","-Hey.
-Hey! Give it back."
1001,"00:53:51,766","00:53:54,401","Why? Is your pet dragon
gonna hurt me?"
1002,"00:53:55,203","00:53:57,071",This isn't funny. Give it back.
1003,"00:53:57,205","00:53:59,073",See ya later.
1004,"00:53:59,207","00:54:00,808","No, no, no!"
1005,"00:54:01,642","00:54:03,144","Come on, let me out."
1006,"00:54:03,578","00:54:05,980",Ah...
1007,"00:54:14,354","00:54:15,990","Look, check out
this stupid whistle."
1008,"00:54:16,124","00:54:18,226",It doesn't even work.
1009,"00:54:27,902","00:54:30,872",Let's get out of here!
1010,"00:54:48,022","00:54:49,791","Mel, what did you do?"
1011,"00:54:53,194","00:54:54,629","Sorry, Ms. Hemm."
1012,"00:54:56,631","00:54:58,065","Thanks, Carl."
1013,"00:54:58,866","00:55:00,768","Don't let anybody see you, okay?"
1014,"00:55:06,406","00:55:08,810",That's cool.
1015,"00:55:09,610","00:55:11,444","-Mel! Hey!
-Ha-ha!"
1016,"00:55:11,579","00:55:12,647","Harold, Moose!"
1017,"00:55:12,780","00:55:14,282",And Porcupine. Nice to meet you.
1018,"00:55:14,414","00:55:16,250","Hi, Porcupine."
1019,"00:55:16,383","00:55:17,718",Did you find your dad?
1020,"00:55:17,852","00:55:19,319","Yes! His name
is Crockett Johnson."
1021,"00:55:19,452","00:55:20,988","-Johnson.
-Gary was helping us."
1022,"00:55:21,122","00:55:22,256","Then we all got arrested, which
is a story for another time."
1023,"00:55:22,389","00:55:23,825",Found him.
1024,"00:55:23,958","00:55:25,660","His house is only like
20 minutes away from here."
1025,"00:55:25,793","00:55:28,461","Oh, that's perfect! Let's get
out of here. Come on, Mel."
1026,"00:55:28,596","00:55:30,865","Whoa, whoa, whoa.
I have thumbs now. I drive."
1027,"00:55:33,034","00:55:35,368","Um, have you ever
driven a motorcycle before?"
1028,"00:55:35,502","00:55:38,072","I'm a porcupine.
I've never done anything before."
1029,"00:55:46,214","00:55:48,348","Slow down, Porcupine!"
1030,"00:56:00,528","00:56:02,897","Can you believe
I've never done this before?"
1031,"00:56:03,030","00:56:04,065","Yes, I can."
1032,"00:56:04,198","00:56:06,133","Look at the road.
Look at the road."
1033,"00:56:32,492","00:56:33,861",Shaknathar!
1034,"00:56:33,995","00:56:36,931","Well, what do you mean
he ran away?"
1035,"00:56:37,064","00:56:38,866",Okay. Thank you.
1036,"00:57:14,001","00:57:16,604","Hello. Welcome to
the Crockett Johnson House."
1037,"00:57:16,737","00:57:17,939",Are you fans of his work?
1038,"00:57:18,072","00:57:21,142",Yeah. Yeah. You could say that.
1039,"00:57:21,275","00:57:22,944","We've traveled a long way
to get here."
1040,"00:57:23,077","00:57:24,845","And I just can't wait
to meet him face-to-face."
1041,"00:57:24,979","00:57:27,315","Oh, well, this is a museum now."
1042,"00:57:27,447","00:57:29,449",Crockett Johnson passed away.
1043,"00:57:30,518","00:57:32,119",Passed away?
1044,"00:57:34,588","00:57:36,924","He's not alive anymore, Harold."
1045,"00:57:37,425","00:57:39,226",It's like my dad.
1046,"00:57:39,360","00:57:41,461","I'd be more than happy
to give you a tour."
1047,"00:57:41,595","00:57:42,863","No, that's okay."
1048,"00:57:43,898","00:57:46,000",Thank you. Have a good day.
1049,"00:57:46,133","00:57:47,635","Thanks. You, too."
1050,"00:57:50,671","00:57:51,973","I'm sorry, Harold."
1051,"00:57:55,475","00:57:57,645",That's the end of the story.
1052,"00:58:04,484","00:58:06,087",Mel! Mel!
1053,"00:58:06,220","00:58:07,588",Come here.
1054,"00:58:07,722","00:58:09,724","What happened? Are you okay?
I was so worried."
1055,"00:58:09,857","00:58:11,692","The principal called and said
you trashed the school"
1056,"00:58:11,826","00:58:12,793",and you ran away?
1057,"00:58:12,927","00:58:14,295","No, it wasn't me. It was Carl."
1058,"00:58:14,428","00:58:15,997",What is going on with you?
1059,"00:58:16,130","00:58:17,698","We found out that Harold
is from a book,"
1060,"00:58:17,832","00:58:19,533",so we came here to find his dad.
1061,"00:58:19,667","00:58:21,335","Mel, go wait in the car."
1062,"00:58:21,469","00:58:23,604","-But, Mom, Harold was--
-Just go!"
1063,"00:58:26,540","00:58:27,742",Go.
1064,"00:58:30,811","00:58:32,813","Look, I don't know
what's going on here,"
1065,"00:58:32,947","00:58:34,615",or whether you're just crazy.
1066,"00:58:34,749","00:58:36,017","But ever since you showed up,"
1067,"00:58:36,150","00:58:37,785","our lives have been
turned upside down."
1068,"00:58:37,918","00:58:39,553",I have a kid to protect.
1069,"00:58:39,687","00:58:40,821","And you're filling his head
with stuff"
1070,"00:58:40,955","00:58:42,523",that's not good for him.
1071,"00:58:42,656","00:58:45,593","So, I'm gonna have to ask you
to stay away from me and my son."
1072,"00:58:45,726","00:58:47,128",Just leave us alone.
1073,"00:58:53,534","00:58:54,835",I'm sorry.
1074,"00:58:56,971","00:58:59,740",I was wrong about everything.
1075,"00:59:08,649","00:59:10,017",Porcupine?
1076,"00:59:11,786","00:59:14,755",It's disappeared.
1077,"00:59:14,889","00:59:16,257","-Harold.
-What do we do?"
1078,"00:59:16,390","00:59:17,825",It's over.
1079,"00:59:17,958","00:59:19,960","What do you mean it's over?
You can do anything."
1080,"00:59:20,094","00:59:21,195","No, I can't."
1081,"00:59:21,929","00:59:23,097",It was the Old Man.
1082,"00:59:23,230","00:59:24,832","It was his book.
It was his world."
1083,"00:59:24,965","00:59:28,135","I'm just a dumb drawing
drawing other dumb drawings."
1084,"00:59:29,403","00:59:30,938",So is that what we are?
1085,"00:59:31,605","00:59:33,274",Just some dumb drawings?
1086,"00:59:34,341","00:59:35,709",I'm sorry.
1087,"00:59:42,783","00:59:44,051",Moose?
1088,"00:59:45,786","00:59:47,054",Porcupine?
1089,"00:59:49,356","00:59:50,357",No.
1090,"00:59:53,194","00:59:54,195",No.
1091,"01:00:37,471","01:00:38,973","Oh, Old Man."
1092,"01:00:41,142","01:00:43,844","You never should have
given me this."
1093,"01:01:17,311","01:01:18,245",Harold.
1094,"01:01:20,848","01:01:22,983","How are you doing, my friend?"
1095,"01:01:33,761","01:01:35,329",Mom?
1096,"01:01:35,462","01:01:37,731","I've got a bad feeling.
I think Harold's in trouble."
1097,"01:01:37,865","01:01:39,900","No, the only one
who's in trouble is you."
1098,"01:01:40,034","01:01:42,403","And I don't want to hear
any more about Harold."
1099,"01:01:42,537","01:01:43,737",Get in the car.
1100,"01:01:52,846","01:01:55,883","Mom! Mom, everything Harold drew
is disappearing."
1101,"01:01:56,016","01:01:58,152","I'm serious, Mom.
Something's wrong."
1102,"01:01:58,285","01:02:00,988","I don't trust Gary.
He's up to something."
1103,"01:02:01,121","01:02:02,923",We gotta help. And I need Carl.
1104,"01:02:03,057","01:02:04,626","-Give me the whistle.
-Mom."
1105,"01:02:04,792","01:02:06,193",Give it to me.
1106,"01:02:20,741","01:02:22,409",You've let everyone down.
1107,"01:02:22,544","01:02:24,311","But without anyone to guide you,"
1108,"01:02:24,445","01:02:28,015","you were bound
to mess things up."
1109,"01:02:28,148","01:02:31,686","You can't use the crayon all
by yourself. It's too powerful."
1110,"01:02:31,819","01:02:33,655",Let me guide your story.
1111,"01:02:33,787","01:02:36,423","My stuff's a little darker.
It's for ages 14 and up."
1112,"01:02:36,558","01:02:38,492",But I can do it.
1113,"01:02:39,159","01:02:42,129","Harold, I can help you."
1114,"01:02:43,931","01:02:45,432",Give me the crayon.
1115,"01:03:24,872","01:03:27,408",I'm a creative person.
1116,"01:03:27,542","01:03:29,243",I create worlds.
1117,"01:03:29,376","01:03:32,980","If you'd read my book,
you would know that this..."
1118,"01:03:33,648","01:03:35,349",is the Dungeon of Azgarach.
1119,"01:03:37,951","01:03:42,256","Oh! These are strange,
cool bracelets."
1120,"01:03:42,389","01:03:45,760","Well, I'm glad you like them."
1121,"01:03:45,893","01:03:48,228","You're going to be wearing them
for a very long time."
1122,"01:03:55,336","01:03:57,104","All of the people
who rejected me,"
1123,"01:03:57,237","01:04:00,107","I'll show them
how wrong they were."
1124,"01:04:00,240","01:04:03,444","Now they'll see
what Library Gary is capable of."
1125,"01:04:03,578","01:04:05,379","No, Gary, that's not
what the crayon is for."
1126,"01:04:05,513","01:04:07,716","You're supposed to use it
to make people happy."
1127,"01:04:07,848","01:04:10,184",Revenge will make me happy.
1128,"01:04:22,162","01:04:23,364",Harold? Ah!
1129,"01:04:25,232","01:04:26,668","Gary, leave him alone.
Let him go."
1130,"01:04:26,801","01:04:28,969","I really feel like I've gone
too far down this path"
1131,"01:04:29,103","01:04:30,337",to turn back now.
1132,"01:04:30,471","01:04:32,172","I know Terry
is going to be distraught"
1133,"01:04:32,306","01:04:33,974","about her missing son,
of course,"
1134,"01:04:34,108","01:04:35,844",but don't worry.
1135,"01:04:35,976","01:04:39,012",Library Gary will comfort her.
1136,"01:04:39,146","01:04:41,616","Maybe someday
I'll even draw her a new son."
1137,"01:04:41,750","01:04:43,384",A cool one that looks like me.
1138,"01:04:43,518","01:04:45,986","You're a seriously
messed-up guy, Gary."
1139,"01:04:46,120","01:04:47,921","Oh, yeah? How about this?"
1140,"01:04:49,390","01:04:51,425",How about what? How about what?
1141,"01:05:07,307","01:05:10,310","The Real World is nothing
like I imagined it."
1142,"01:05:13,447","01:05:14,448",No.
1143,"01:05:20,655","01:05:21,656",Mel?
1144,"01:05:23,123","01:05:24,559",Can we talk?
1145,"01:05:27,394","01:05:28,429",Mel--
1146,"01:05:28,897","01:05:30,097",Mel?
1147,"01:05:35,135","01:05:37,438",Now the world will gaze upon me
1148,"01:05:38,272","01:05:40,374",and be impressed.
1149,"01:05:40,508","01:05:43,310","Onward, Thrahaknahar!"
1150,"01:05:52,319","01:05:54,254","I'm so sorry, Mel."
1151,"01:05:55,890","01:05:57,525",I can't draw us out of this one.
1152,"01:05:57,659","01:05:59,727",I really messed up.
1153,"01:05:59,861","01:06:04,164","No, you didn't.
You made things a lot better."
1154,"01:06:05,834","01:06:07,401",You believed in me.
1155,"01:06:08,670","01:06:10,003",And my mom.
1156,"01:06:10,137","01:06:11,405",And Carl.
1157,"01:06:14,441","01:06:16,410",Just believe in yourself.
1158,"01:06:17,411","01:06:19,046",I do.
1159,"01:06:23,317","01:06:25,486","And we can draw
our way out of here."
1160,"01:07:05,425","01:07:06,528",Hey! Hey!
1161,"01:07:06,661","01:07:09,229",Hyah!
1162,"01:07:09,363","01:07:11,198",Let's go get him.
1163,"01:07:16,871","01:07:18,171",Hyah!
1164,"01:07:18,305","01:07:22,109","Upon this rock
I shall erect my kingdom."
1165,"01:07:35,222","01:07:37,592","That was fun, right?
Go hide, go hide."
1166,"01:07:39,159","01:07:40,427",How did you get out?
1167,"01:07:41,596","01:07:42,730",With this.
1168,"01:07:45,900","01:07:47,467",Mine's bigger.
1169,"01:07:47,602","01:07:50,605","Look, Gary, it doesn't belong
to you, okay? Give it back."
1170,"01:07:50,738","01:07:53,473","Mm. Sorry.
I can't do that, Harold."
1171,"01:08:24,072","01:08:25,272",Draw.
1172,"01:08:32,279","01:08:33,715",Huh?
1173,"01:08:41,154","01:08:43,223",Yay for Harold!
1174,"01:09:10,918","01:09:12,452",Ow.
1175,"01:09:22,730","01:09:24,364",Fire!
1176,"01:09:24,498","01:09:25,900","Harold, look out!"
1177,"01:09:35,643","01:09:36,944",Oh! Oh!
1178,"01:09:42,617","01:09:44,652","You'll have to do
better than that."
1179,"01:09:50,158","01:09:51,425",That was better.
1180,"01:09:54,962","01:09:57,131",No! No! No.
1181,"01:09:57,264","01:09:58,498",No. No.
1182,"01:09:58,633","01:09:59,701","-Give me the crayon.
-No."
1183,"01:09:59,834","01:10:01,201","-Yes.
-Never!"
1184,"01:10:01,334","01:10:03,336","Gary! No, no..."
1185,"01:10:04,839","01:10:05,873",Mm-mm.
1186,"01:10:08,776","01:10:10,945","Gary! Everyone knows
you don't eat crayons."
1187,"01:10:11,445","01:10:12,847",Not good.
1188,"01:10:21,756","01:10:23,256",The power.
1189,"01:10:24,357","01:10:25,660",I feel it.
1190,"01:10:43,745","01:10:45,412",Where is he?
1191,"01:10:45,546","01:10:47,215","Gary, where are you?"
1192,"01:10:47,347","01:10:49,282",There is no Gary.
1193,"01:10:53,755","01:10:56,356",Only G'Garaur.
1194,"01:10:58,693","01:11:00,862","Mel! Oh, my God. Are you okay?"
1195,"01:11:00,995","01:11:03,330","I was so worried.
What is happening here?"
1196,"01:11:03,463","01:11:05,199","Mom, Gary swallowed the crayon."
1197,"01:11:05,332","01:11:06,701","I think he's
trying to kill Harold."
1198,"01:11:10,872","01:11:12,607","-We have to get out of here.
-Yeah."
1199,"01:11:12,740","01:11:14,742","Terry, don't go."
1200,"01:11:14,876","01:11:16,343",Come. Join me.
1201,"01:11:16,476","01:11:18,946","So that we may
rule over this land."
1202,"01:11:19,080","01:11:22,016",Man and woman.
1203,"01:11:22,784","01:11:24,852","-No thank you.
-Really?"
1204,"01:11:24,986","01:11:27,755","Yup. No.
I do like your new hair though."
1205,"01:11:31,926","01:11:34,327","I'll show you
what you're missing."
1206,"01:11:43,070","01:11:44,572",The glaive...
1207,"01:11:45,940","01:11:47,775",of G'Garaur!
1208,"01:11:50,144","01:11:51,411",Run!
1209,"01:11:55,382","01:11:56,651",Watch out!
1210,"01:12:03,991","01:12:04,992",Harold!
1211,"01:12:07,327","01:12:08,529",Watch out!
1212,"01:12:12,834","01:12:14,035",Harold!
1213,"01:12:14,168","01:12:15,269","Oh, no!"
1214,"01:12:19,907","01:12:23,744","Hey. I should have believed you
a long time ago."
1215,"01:12:30,184","01:12:33,554","You see, Harold,
this power was meant for me."
1216,"01:12:46,701","01:12:48,803","Sic him, Carl!"
1217,"01:12:59,379","01:13:01,682",Oh. Not the hair.
1218,"01:13:01,816","01:13:05,052","That is the only thing
she likes about me."
1219,"01:13:14,262","01:13:15,830",Carl!
1220,"01:13:17,031","01:13:18,633",No!
1221,"01:13:18,766","01:13:20,001","No, Gary. You have to stop this."
1222,"01:13:20,134","01:13:22,136","This isn't
what the crayon is for."
1223,"01:13:24,372","01:13:25,973",G'Garaur!
1224,"01:13:30,278","01:13:31,879","It's over, Harold."
1225,"01:13:32,013","01:13:35,783","You're just a cartoon drawing
from the young reader section"
1226,"01:13:35,917","01:13:39,120","with no narrator
to tell you what to do"
1227,"01:13:39,253","01:13:41,122",and no friends to help you.
1228,"01:13:46,127","01:13:48,296","Well, I believe in me."
1229,"01:13:48,428","01:13:50,097",And I believe in my friends.
1230,"01:13:50,231","01:13:51,966",Friends are overrated.
1231,"01:13:52,600","01:13:53,768",So I've been told.
1232,"01:14:03,077","01:14:04,712","-Do you need a hand?
-Yes!"
1233,"01:14:04,845","01:14:07,148","I've lost the crayon.
We have to get it back."
1234,"01:14:07,281","01:14:11,319","Oh, look, the whole
storybook back together again."
1235,"01:14:11,451","01:14:12,887",How touching.
1236,"01:14:14,388","01:14:15,790",I've got this.
1237,"01:14:18,659","01:14:20,728",Thraknah!
1238,"01:14:21,461","01:14:22,730",Ha!
1239,"01:14:23,496","01:14:24,699",Yes!
1240,"01:14:28,202","01:14:30,771","I will not give up
this power, Harold."
1241,"01:14:34,474","01:14:37,111","I hate to do this to you, Gary,
but you left me no choice."
1242,"01:14:37,244","01:14:39,313","Nothing you can draw
will be beat me."
1243,"01:14:40,081","01:14:42,049",Spiderfly.
1244,"01:14:52,393","01:14:53,894",The glaive!
1245,"01:14:54,028","01:14:55,029",Ah!
1246,"01:14:56,764","01:14:58,566","Well, Moose, you're up."
1247,"01:14:59,133","01:15:00,101",What?
1248,"01:15:20,988","01:15:22,023",Oh.
1249,"01:15:41,542","01:15:42,543",We did it!
1250,"01:15:42,676","01:15:44,245","-Come on!
-Yes!"
1251,"01:15:46,447","01:15:47,681",Carl!
1252,"01:15:58,527","01:15:59,760",You okay?
1253,"01:16:03,731","01:16:06,834","I just wanted a place
where I belonged."
1254,"01:16:09,703","01:16:11,872",I wanted my world
1255,"01:16:12,673","01:16:14,108",to be real.
1256,"01:16:48,309","01:16:49,743",It's beautiful.
1257,"01:16:49,877","01:16:52,346","Why does that woman
look like me?"
1258,"01:16:54,849","01:16:56,283",Does she?
1259,"01:16:58,953","01:17:01,222","Uh, go, go, go.
You belong there..."
1260,"01:17:01,355","01:17:02,890",G'Garaur.
1261,"01:17:05,594","01:17:07,161",You said it right.
1262,"01:17:20,374","01:17:22,009","Oh, and, Harold, I--"
1263,"01:17:23,244","01:17:25,045",We should leave him in there.
1264,"01:18:14,695","01:18:15,796",Yeah.
1265,"01:18:15,930","01:18:18,332","Aw, your antlers!"
1266,"01:18:54,569","01:18:56,337","I wonder what
the old man would say"
1267,"01:18:56,470","01:18:58,005",if he could see me now.
1268,"01:18:58,138","01:19:00,841","I think he would
have been proud of you."
1269,"01:19:02,977","01:19:04,245",Thank you.
1270,"01:19:05,312","01:19:06,747",Oh.
1271,"01:19:08,182","01:19:11,318","Did he ever say
why he made Harold?"
1272,"01:19:11,885","01:19:13,287",Follow me.
1273,"01:19:36,944","01:19:38,747","Dear Harold,"
1274,"01:19:38,879","01:19:42,416","one day you might wanna know
why I made you."
1275,"01:19:42,550","01:19:44,385","In the beginning,
you were just a boy"
1276,"01:19:44,519","01:19:47,354","with a purple crayon
and a blank page."
1277,"01:19:48,523","01:19:51,693","I wanted to show folks
that with a little imagination,"
1278,"01:19:51,825","01:19:55,496","you can make your life
whatever you want it to be."
1279,"01:19:58,799","01:20:00,501",I wanted you to inspire people
1280,"01:20:00,635","01:20:03,304","to live their lives
that way, too."
1281,"01:20:06,173","01:20:08,677","We only have
so much time in this world,"
1282,"01:20:08,809","01:20:12,580","but we leave our mark
in the lives we change."
1283,"01:20:14,649","01:20:16,350","And I know you, Harold,"
1284,"01:20:16,483","01:20:18,986","will keep inspiring
our world..."
1285,"01:20:21,989","01:20:23,490",one person at a time.
1286,"01:20:27,428","01:20:31,065","Because life isn't something
that just happens to you."
1287,"01:20:31,965","01:20:33,233",Thank you.
1288,"01:20:33,367","01:20:35,269",It's something you create.
1289,"01:20:37,004","01:20:38,205",The trick...
1290,"01:20:39,106","01:20:41,075",is in the imagining.
1291,"01:20:41,576","01:20:42,843",I'll see you soon.
1292,"01:20:51,885","01:20:53,921","-All right, guys. Ready?
-Ready!"
1293,"01:20:54,054","01:20:56,223","Moose? Moose, are you ready?"
1294,"01:20:56,357","01:20:58,793","Oh, yeah. Yeah, I'm ready."
1295,"01:20:58,926","01:21:00,861",I was drawn ready.
1296,"01:21:01,895","01:21:03,030","Come on, everybody!"
1297,"01:23:00,280","01:23:03,317","Music as sweet
as a phoenix song."
1298,"01:23:17,030","01:23:18,065",Zerry.
1299,"01:23:18,198","01:23:19,767",O Warrior Queen.
1300,"01:23:20,434","01:23:22,035","I found you at last,"
1301,"01:23:22,169","01:23:24,772","and nothing in the world
shall tear us asunder."
1302,"01:23:24,906","01:23:28,008","Oh, that's so flattering, Gar--"
1303,"01:23:28,141","01:23:30,010","-Gagur--
-G'Garaur."
1304,"01:23:30,143","01:23:31,679",Gar-gar.
1305,"01:23:31,813","01:23:33,247",But I'm seeing someone.
1306,"01:23:36,183","01:23:38,051",Gondaldemor?
1307,"01:23:41,556","01:23:42,790",Good morrow.
1308,"01:23:44,792","01:23:46,059","Well, that's cool."
1309,"01:23:46,828","01:23:48,730",I'm super busy anyway!
