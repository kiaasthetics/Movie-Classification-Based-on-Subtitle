2,"00:01:14,743","00:01:18,830","the best-kept secret this
side of, well, anywhere."
3,"00:01:19,748","00:01:22,917","Granted, it may not look like much,
but this wet heap of rock..."
4,"00:01:23,084","00:01:26,129",packs more than a few surprises.
5,"00:01:30,967","00:01:35,472","Life here is amazing, just
not for the faint of heart."
6,"00:01:35,638","00:01:37,866","You see, where most
folks enjoy hobbies"
7,"00:01:37,891","00:01:39,851",like whittling or needlepoint...
8,"00:01:40,018","00:01:42,520",we Berkians prefer...
9,"00:01:43,313","00:01:45,565","a little something
we like to call..."
10,"00:01:47,901","00:01:49,736",dragon racing!
11,"00:01:56,534","00:01:58,036",Whoo!
12,"00:02:02,499","00:02:04,726",Whoa!
13,"00:02:04,751","00:02:08,146","I'm sorry, Fishlegs.
Did you want that?"
14,"00:02:09,672","00:02:11,883","Snotlout, that was mine!"
15,"00:02:12,050","00:02:13,259","Here you go, babe."
16,"00:02:13,635","00:02:15,011","Did I tell you that you
look amazing today..."
17,"00:02:15,178","00:02:16,304",because you do.
18,"00:02:16,513","00:02:19,224","Come on, Barf. It's
starting to stink around here."
19,"00:02:19,390","00:02:21,184","Nope.
Still hates you."
20,"00:02:21,351","00:02:23,561","Let's blow this place, Belch!"
21,"00:02:24,145","00:02:25,563",All right!
22,"00:02:31,027","00:02:32,904",Yeah!
23,"00:02:33,404","00:02:35,990","Ha-ha! That's nine
for the Twins..."
24,"00:02:36,282","00:02:38,243",Astrid lags with three.
25,"00:02:38,409","00:02:42,247","Fishlegs and Snotlout
trail with none."
26,"00:02:42,413","00:02:43,873",And Hiccup is...
27,"00:02:45,166","00:02:47,252",nowhere to be found.
28,"00:02:47,752","00:02:51,381","Scared him off with the big
talk, didn't you, Stoick?"
29,"00:02:52,882","00:02:54,092","What are you doing, Snotlout?"
30,"00:02:54,342","00:02:55,635",They're gonna win now.
31,"00:02:55,802","00:02:58,179","She's my princess. Whatever
she wants, she gets."
32,"00:02:58,346","00:03:01,349","Ruffnut? Didn't she
try to bury you alive?"
33,"00:03:01,516","00:03:02,756",Only for a few hours.
34,"00:03:05,186","00:03:09,023","Now, dragons used to
be a bit of a problem here..."
35,"00:03:09,190","00:03:10,483",but that was 5 years ago.
36,"00:03:10,650","00:03:12,585","Now, they have all moved in."
37,"00:03:12,610","00:03:14,821","And really, why wouldn't they?"
38,"00:03:14,988","00:03:16,781",We have custom stables...
39,"00:03:16,948","00:03:18,992","all-you-can-eat
feeding stations..."
40,"00:03:19,158","00:03:21,494","a full-service
dragon wash..."
41,"00:03:23,079","00:03:26,833","even top-of-the-line fire
prevention if I do say so myself."
42,"00:03:28,167","00:03:29,544","It's time, Gobber."
43,"00:03:29,711","00:03:31,296","Righty-ho.
Last lap!"
44,"00:03:36,050","00:03:37,927","The Black Sheep!
Come on, Stormfly."
45,"00:03:38,094","00:03:39,904",We can still win this thing!
46,"00:03:42,181","00:03:43,821","- Come on, Barf!
- Let's go!"
47,"00:03:44,601","00:03:45,602","Go, Meatlug!"
48,"00:03:46,394","00:03:47,620",Whoo-hoo!
49,"00:03:47,645","00:03:49,439","Let's go!
Let's go! Let's go!"
50,"00:03:50,398","00:03:51,858",This is your big moment.
51,"00:03:52,400","00:03:53,943",Have a nice flight!
52,"00:03:57,322","00:03:58,323","Up, up, up!"
53,"00:04:01,951","00:04:03,119","- No!
- Yes!"
54,"00:04:03,286","00:04:04,746","Good job, Meatlug."
55,"00:04:05,705","00:04:08,124","Here you go, darling.
Mine is worth ten."
56,"00:04:08,666","00:04:10,209","Yeah!
The Black Sheep!"
57,"00:04:11,878","00:04:13,838","You guys are
fighting for Ruffnut?"
58,"00:04:14,005","00:04:15,173",I'm totally winning!
59,"00:04:15,340","00:04:17,467",We're winning together!
60,"00:04:17,926","00:04:18,968",No!
61,"00:04:21,220","00:04:23,139","Whoo! No one can
stop me now!"
62,"00:04:23,306","00:04:25,808","Except for me. We're
attached, genius."
63,"00:04:25,975","00:04:28,478","Quit trying to steal all my glory!
Hey!"
64,"00:04:29,562","00:04:30,605","Get them, Astrid!"
65,"00:04:30,813","00:04:31,956",It's my glory!
66,"00:04:31,981","00:04:33,066",Always ruining everything!
67,"00:04:33,232","00:04:34,312","No sheep, no glory!"
68,"00:04:34,317","00:04:36,194",Gotcha!
69,"00:04:37,070","00:04:38,112","Whoa!
Astrid!"
70,"00:04:38,279","00:04:40,782",Well played!
71,"00:04:40,907","00:04:43,618",That's my future daughter-in-law!
72,"00:04:47,622","00:04:49,457","Excuse me.
Stormfly!"
73,"00:04:53,461","00:04:55,146",Whoa!
74,"00:05:01,886","00:05:05,365","That's 13!
Astrid takes the game!"
75,"00:05:07,433","00:05:10,436","Yep,
Berk is pretty much perfect."
76,"00:05:10,603","00:05:12,063","All of my hard
work has paid off."
77,"00:05:12,438","00:05:14,123","And it's a good thing, too,"
78,"00:05:14,148","00:05:15,750","because with Vikings on
the backs of dragons..."
79,"00:05:15,775","00:05:17,215",Whoo-hoo!
80,"00:05:17,235","00:05:19,612","...the world just got
a whole lot bigger."
81,"00:05:36,879","00:05:37,922",Yeah!
82,"00:05:40,842","00:05:42,527",Let the wind carry us
83,"00:05:42,552","00:05:45,430","To the clouds,
hurry up, all right"
84,"00:05:47,682","00:05:49,409",We can travel so far
85,"00:05:49,434","00:05:53,104",As our eyes can see
86,"00:05:54,522","00:06:00,486",We go where no one goes
87,"00:06:01,362","00:06:05,258",We slow for no one
88,"00:06:05,283","00:06:10,538",Get out of our way...
89,"00:06:20,465","00:06:22,091","So what do you think, bud?"
90,"00:06:22,258","00:06:23,843","You wanna give
this another shot?"
91,"00:06:25,053","00:06:27,013","Toothless!
It will be fine."
92,"00:06:30,349","00:06:31,476",Ready?
93,"00:06:38,357","00:06:40,526",Yeah!
94,"00:06:44,447","00:06:45,990",Yeah!
95,"00:07:24,946","00:07:27,156",This is amazing!
96,"00:07:27,532","00:07:29,158",No longer amazing!
97,"00:07:29,283","00:07:30,343",Toothless!
98,"00:07:33,162","00:07:34,247",No!
99,"00:07:39,877","00:07:42,296",Whoa!
100,"00:07:52,306","00:07:53,307",Whoo!
101,"00:07:54,016","00:07:56,310",That really came out of nowhere.
102,"00:08:02,525","00:08:05,987","We have to work on your
solo gliding there, bud."
103,"00:08:06,154","00:08:07,572",That locked-up tail...
104,"00:08:07,738","00:08:11,117","makes for some pretty sloppy
rescue maneuvers, hey?"
105,"00:08:28,968","00:08:31,345","Looks like we
found another one, bud."
106,"00:08:35,683","00:08:38,477","What, do you want an apology?"
107,"00:08:38,644","00:08:41,647","Is that why you're
pouting, big baby boo?"
108,"00:08:41,772","00:08:44,692","Well, try this on!"
109,"00:08:45,484","00:08:47,695",You feeling it yet?
110,"00:08:47,862","00:08:51,073","Picking up on all of my
heartfelt remorse?"
111,"00:08:53,451","00:08:54,493","Come on, come on."
112,"00:08:54,660","00:08:57,371","You wouldn't hurt a
one-legged..."
113,"00:08:59,040","00:09:02,185","You're right! You're right!
You win. You win."
114,"00:09:02,210","00:09:04,353","Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!"
115,"00:09:04,378","00:09:06,297","He's down.
And it's ugly."
116,"00:09:06,464","00:09:09,300","Dragons and Vikings,
enemies again..."
117,"00:09:09,467","00:09:12,511","locked in combat
to the bitter..."
118,"00:09:19,393","00:09:21,287",You know that doesn't wash out.
119,"00:09:46,379","00:09:48,339","So, what should we name it?"
120,"00:09:49,215","00:09:51,175","""Itchy Armpit"" it is."
121,"00:09:52,593","00:09:53,886","What do you reckon, bud?"
122,"00:09:54,053","00:09:57,223","Think we might find a few
Timberjacks in those woods?"
123,"00:09:57,390","00:09:59,642","The odd Whispering Death
or two in the rocks?"
124,"00:10:01,060","00:10:05,898","Who knows? Maybe we'll finally
track down another Night Fury."
125,"00:10:07,400","00:10:09,193",Wouldn't that be something?
126,"00:10:10,027","00:10:12,880","So, what do you say?
Just keep going?"
127,"00:10:22,581","00:10:24,208","Afternoon, milady."
128,"00:10:24,625","00:10:26,143",Where have you been?
129,"00:10:26,168","00:10:28,212",Hi.
130,"00:10:28,713","00:10:31,924","Winning races, what else?"
131,"00:10:32,091","00:10:33,718",The real question is...
132,"00:10:33,884","00:10:34,969",where have you been?
133,"00:10:35,136","00:10:36,387",Avoiding my dad.
134,"00:10:36,554","00:10:38,222","No.
What happened now?"
135,"00:10:38,431","00:10:40,474",You're gonna love this.
136,"00:10:40,641","00:10:42,810","I wake up.
The sun is shining."
137,"00:10:42,977","00:10:45,646","Terrible Terrors are
singing on the rooftop."
138,"00:10:45,813","00:10:47,106",I saunter down to breakfast...
139,"00:10:47,273","00:10:49,483","thinking all is right
with the world and I get..."
140,"00:10:50,026","00:10:51,944","""Son, we need to talk."""
141,"00:10:52,194","00:10:54,297","""Not now, Dad.
I got a whole day"""
142,"00:10:54,322","00:10:56,365","""of goofing off to get
started."""
143,"00:10:56,532","00:10:59,243","Okay, first of all,
I don't sound like that."
144,"00:10:59,410","00:11:00,828",Who is this character?
145,"00:11:00,995","00:11:04,915","And second, what is that thing
you're doing with my shoulders?"
146,"00:11:05,082","00:11:08,169","Yeah, that's a truly
flattering impersonation."
147,"00:11:08,336","00:11:10,046",Anyway. he goes...
148,"00:11:10,629","00:11:13,841","""You're the pride of
Berk, son, and I couldn't be prouder."""
149,"00:11:14,008","00:11:15,509","""Aw, thanks, Dad."""
150,"00:11:15,676","00:11:18,262","""I'm pretty impressed
with myself, too."""
151,"00:11:18,512","00:11:21,223","When have I ever
done that with my hands?"
152,"00:11:21,390","00:11:22,933",You just did.
153,"00:11:23,517","00:11:26,729","Okay.
Just hold still."
154,"00:11:27,605","00:11:29,357",This is very serious.
155,"00:11:32,109","00:11:33,402","""You're all grown up..."""
156,"00:11:33,569","00:11:36,364","""and since no chief could ask

158,"00:11:37,656","00:11:38,908",To make you chief!
159,"00:11:39,075","00:11:41,927","My gods!
Hiccup, that's amazing!"
160,"00:11:43,245","00:11:45,264","You're gonna wear
out the spring coil."
161,"00:11:45,289","00:11:47,391","The calibration
is very sensitive."
162,"00:11:52,296","00:11:53,881",Yeah...
163,"00:11:55,007","00:11:57,301","so this is what
I'm dealing with."
164,"00:11:57,468","00:11:58,469",What did you tell him?
165,"00:11:58,636","00:12:02,365","I didn't. By the time he
turned around, I was gone."
166,"00:12:02,390","00:12:04,283","Well,"
167,"00:12:04,308","00:12:06,310",it's a lot of responsibility.
168,"00:12:06,477","00:12:09,897","The map will have
to wait for sure..."
169,"00:12:10,064","00:12:11,457","and I'll need to fly Toothless,"
170,"00:12:11,482","00:12:12,900","since you'll be too busy, but..."
171,"00:12:16,654","00:12:18,531","It's not me, Astrid."
172,"00:12:18,697","00:12:21,008","All those speeches and planning,"
173,"00:12:21,033","00:12:23,369","and running the village,
that's his thing."
174,"00:12:23,536","00:12:25,371","I think you're
missing the point."
175,"00:12:25,538","00:12:28,416","I mean, ""chief.""
What an honor."
176,"00:12:28,582","00:12:30,709","I'd be pretty excited.
I..."
177,"00:12:31,419","00:12:33,045",I'm not like you.
178,"00:12:33,212","00:12:35,172",You know exactly who you are.
179,"00:12:35,339","00:12:37,133",You always have.
180,"00:12:38,217","00:12:39,844",But I'm still looking.
181,"00:12:40,010","00:12:42,346",I know that I'm not my father...
182,"00:12:42,513","00:12:45,141",and I never met my mother...
183,"00:12:45,975","00:12:47,768",so what does that make me?
184,"00:12:53,232","00:12:57,361","What you're searching for
isn't out there, Hiccup."
185,"00:12:57,778","00:12:59,321",It's in here.
186,"00:13:00,406","00:13:02,491",Maybe you just don't see it yet.
187,"00:13:03,534","00:13:04,994",Maybe.
188,"00:13:05,327","00:13:07,037",But you know...
189,"00:13:07,204","00:13:09,665",there is something out there.
190,"00:13:09,832","00:13:11,667",Hiccup...
191,"00:13:40,988","00:13:42,323",Whoa!
192,"00:13:46,410","00:13:47,536",Stay close.
193,"00:14:00,257","00:14:01,759",What happened here?
194,"00:14:08,140","00:14:10,201","All right, easy, bud."
195,"00:14:10,226","00:14:11,602",Hiccup!
196,"00:14:12,228","00:14:13,229",Fire!
197,"00:14:13,437","00:14:14,480","Astrid, look out!"
198,"00:14:18,150","00:14:19,318",Hiccup!
199,"00:14:24,323","00:14:26,450",Watch the tail!
200,"00:14:27,409","00:14:29,161",Tie those legs up!
201,"00:14:32,540","00:14:33,707",Is that what I think it is?
202,"00:14:33,874","00:14:34,875",Stop!
203,"00:14:35,042","00:14:36,502",Stormfly!
204,"00:14:37,711","00:14:39,129",What are you doing?
205,"00:14:40,464","00:14:41,565",Whoa!
206,"00:14:41,590","00:14:42,675",Back again?
207,"00:14:44,301","00:14:46,387",Soil my britches.
208,"00:14:46,554","00:14:49,098",That is a Night Fury.
209,"00:14:49,265","00:14:51,350","I thought they were
all gone for good."
210,"00:14:51,767","00:14:54,144","It looks like our luck's had
a turn for the better, lads."
211,"00:14:54,311","00:14:56,480","Don't think Drago
has one of those..."
212,"00:14:57,064","00:14:58,190",in his dragon army.
213,"00:14:58,357","00:14:59,817",Dragon army?
214,"00:14:59,984","00:15:01,652","Look, we don't want any trouble."
215,"00:15:01,819","00:15:02,962",Ha!
216,"00:15:02,987","00:15:04,755",You should have thought of that
217,"00:15:04,780","00:15:06,448","before you stole
all of our dragons..."
218,"00:15:06,615","00:15:08,801",and blasted our fort to bits!
219,"00:15:10,744","00:15:12,079",What are you talking about?
220,"00:15:12,246","00:15:13,956",You think we did this?
221,"00:15:14,415","00:15:17,434","Dragon trapping
is hard enough work"
222,"00:15:17,459","00:15:19,920","as it is without
do-gooder dragon riders..."
223,"00:15:20,087","00:15:21,714",sneaking in to rescue them.
224,"00:15:21,880","00:15:23,591",What do-gooder?
225,"00:15:24,425","00:15:26,594",There are other dragon riders?
226,"00:15:26,927","00:15:28,737","You mean other than your
thieving friend from last night?"
227,"00:15:28,762","00:15:29,763",You tell me.
228,"00:15:30,431","00:15:32,850","You may have an ice-spitting
dragon on your side..."
229,"00:15:33,684","00:15:35,603","but we still have
a quota to fill."
230,"00:15:35,769","00:15:38,897","How do you suppose we explain
this mess to Drago Bludvist?"
231,"00:15:39,064","00:15:42,526","Drago what-fist? Does
anything you say make sense?"
232,"00:15:42,693","00:15:46,655","He's expecting a new shipment of
dragons for his army by tomorrow."
233,"00:15:46,822","00:15:50,200","And Drago don't
take well to excuses."
234,"00:15:50,367","00:15:52,036",This is what he gave me...
235,"00:15:52,202","00:15:54,455","last time I showed up
empty-handed."
236,"00:15:54,622","00:15:58,083","He promised to be far less
understanding in the future."
237,"00:15:58,751","00:16:01,295","All right, look, we don't know
anything about a dragon thief..."
238,"00:16:01,462","00:16:02,838","or an ice-spitting
dragon..."
239,"00:16:03,297","00:16:07,176","or your lunatic boss
and his dragon army, okay?"
240,"00:16:07,343","00:16:10,137","Just give us back our
dragon and we'll go..."
241,"00:16:10,304","00:16:12,931","strange, hostile person
whom we've never met."
242,"00:16:13,098","00:16:14,975",Where are my manners?
243,"00:16:15,517","00:16:16,518",I'm Eret...
244,"00:16:16,935","00:16:18,562",son of Eret.
245,"00:16:19,313","00:16:21,899",Finest dragon trapper alive.
246,"00:16:22,608","00:16:23,609","After all,"
247,"00:16:24,193","00:16:27,321","it's not just anyone who
can capture a Night Fury."
248,"00:16:27,905","00:16:31,800","And this is Toothless.
He says we're going. Now."
249,"00:16:33,494","00:16:34,745",They all say that.
250,"00:16:34,912","00:16:36,872","Rush 'em, lads!"
251,"00:16:43,087","00:16:44,088","Stormfly!
Come on!"
252,"00:16:44,296","00:16:45,297",Go! Go!
253,"00:16:49,677","00:16:52,096","You will never hold on
to those dragons..."
254,"00:16:52,262","00:16:53,514",you hear me?
255,"00:16:53,681","00:16:56,350",Drago is coming for them all!
256,"00:16:59,311","00:17:01,372","- Come on, Meatlug!
Whoo-hoo!"
257,"00:17:01,397","00:17:02,623",Yahoo!
258,"00:17:04,817","00:17:06,402",Whoa!
259,"00:17:11,240","00:17:12,341","Hey, there, Stoick!"
260,"00:17:12,366","00:17:13,784","Hey, how are you?
Beautiful day."
261,"00:17:13,951","00:17:16,245","Hello, Spitelout. Great race."
262,"00:17:16,412","00:17:17,913","Sorry, Mrs. Ack."
263,"00:17:18,038","00:17:19,098",Any sign of him?
264,"00:17:19,123","00:17:22,626","He's probably flown off
the edge of the world by now."
265,"00:17:22,793","00:17:24,962","Are you sure you want that
kid running the village?"
266,"00:17:25,129","00:17:27,089","You can still
delay your retirement."
267,"00:17:27,256","00:17:29,842",He's ready. You'll see.
268,"00:17:30,426","00:17:33,011",There he is!
269,"00:17:33,846","00:17:36,432",The pride of Berk!
270,"00:17:36,598","00:17:39,601","Who finally decided
to show up for work. Yay."
271,"00:17:39,768","00:17:41,395",Sorry. Got held up.
272,"00:17:41,562","00:17:42,771","Hey, Dad, could I have a word?"
273,"00:17:42,938","00:17:44,982","Something you're
itching to tell me?"
274,"00:17:45,149","00:17:47,735","Not quite the itch you're
thinking of, but yes."
275,"00:17:47,901","00:17:50,779","Good man!
Now, lesson one."
276,"00:17:50,946","00:17:54,032","A chief's first duty is
to his people, so... 41?"
277,"00:17:54,199","00:17:56,243","Can we just talk in private?
Forty..."
278,"00:17:56,410","00:17:58,620",That's me! That's me! I'm next!
279,"00:17:58,787","00:18:00,080",If we could just talk...
280,"00:18:00,247","00:18:02,082","Excuse me.
I have been here all day."
281,"00:18:02,249","00:18:04,710","Okay, okay. I want one
of those high seaters..."
282,"00:18:04,877","00:18:08,213","with lots of spikes and a
big stowage compartment."
283,"00:18:08,380","00:18:10,299","Absolutely.
You got it, sir."
284,"00:18:10,466","00:18:12,192","Dad, this is actually
a little more important"
285,"00:18:12,217","00:18:13,260",than building saddles.
286,"00:18:13,427","00:18:15,612","Lesson two.
No task is too small"
287,"00:18:15,637","00:18:17,514","when it comes to
serving your people."
288,"00:18:17,681","00:18:19,241","Excuse us, Grump."
289,"00:18:19,266","00:18:20,267","Dad, can we just talk..."
290,"00:18:20,434","00:18:21,602",Grump!
291,"00:18:21,769","00:18:23,687","You let the forge
die down again!"
292,"00:18:29,818","00:18:32,613","That's it, Grump.
You're going up for adoption."
293,"00:18:32,863","00:18:35,240","There you go.
Go on. Have away."
294,"00:18:35,699","00:18:37,885","Seriously, I really
need to tell you"
295,"00:18:37,910","00:18:39,953","about this new
land we came across."
296,"00:18:40,120","00:18:41,789","Another one?
Any new dragons?"
297,"00:18:41,955","00:18:43,791","We didn't stick
around to find out."
298,"00:18:43,957","00:18:46,919","These folks weren't
particularly friendly."
299,"00:18:47,795","00:18:49,980","Really? Your Night
Fury and Deadly Nadder"
300,"00:18:50,005","00:18:51,840","didn't bring them
cheering to the rooftops?"
301,"00:18:52,007","00:18:53,509","No, this was different."
302,"00:18:53,675","00:18:56,804","Not the standard run-for-the-hills
hoo-ha I've come to enjoy."
303,"00:18:56,970","00:18:59,473",These guys were trappers.
304,"00:18:59,932","00:19:01,475",Dragon trappers.
305,"00:19:01,642","00:19:02,882",You should have seen their fort.
306,"00:19:02,893","00:19:07,189","All blown apart and stuck in giant
spikes of ice. It was weird!"
307,"00:19:07,356","00:19:09,274","I've never seen
anything like it."
308,"00:19:09,441","00:19:11,485","And worst of all,
they thought we did it!"
309,"00:19:11,652","00:19:13,796",You two are gonna get yourselves
310,"00:19:13,821","00:19:15,864","in serious trouble
one of these days."
311,"00:19:16,031","00:19:18,700","Not everyone appreciates
this way of life."
312,"00:19:19,159","00:19:20,494","Aye, Gobber's right, son."
313,"00:19:20,661","00:19:21,912",Best we keep to our own.
314,"00:19:22,079","00:19:25,082","Besides, you'll have more
important uses for your time."
315,"00:19:27,167","00:19:29,753","Once we make
the big announcement!"
316,"00:19:30,629","00:19:33,173",They are building a dragon army.
317,"00:19:34,550","00:19:37,469","Or at least
the guy they work for is."
318,"00:19:38,011","00:19:40,639","Dargo Bloody Fist, or something."
319,"00:19:42,850","00:19:46,603","I'll bloody his fist with my face
if he tries to take my dragon!"
320,"00:19:46,770","00:19:47,771",Or mine!
321,"00:19:48,021","00:19:49,439",You're such a moron.
322,"00:19:49,606","00:19:50,691",A beautiful moron.
323,"00:19:50,816","00:19:52,234",Yeah.
324,"00:19:52,651","00:19:55,404","Bludvist?
Drago Bludvist?"
325,"00:19:55,571","00:19:57,239",Yeah. Wait.
326,"00:19:57,739","00:19:58,907",You know him?
327,"00:20:01,952","00:20:03,011",Ground all dragons!
328,"00:20:03,036","00:20:04,096",What? Why?
329,"00:20:04,121","00:20:05,455",Seal the gates!
330,"00:20:05,831","00:20:07,140",Lower the storm doors!
331,"00:20:07,165","00:20:08,433",Wait! What is happening?
332,"00:20:08,458","00:20:09,476",Come on!
333,"00:20:09,501","00:20:10,878","You heard the man!
Lock it down."
334,"00:20:13,547","00:20:17,634","No dragon or Viking sets foot
off this island until I give the word!"
335,"00:20:17,801","00:20:20,041","Wait, because some guy you
knew is stirring up trouble..."
336,"00:20:20,178","00:20:21,638",in some faraway land?
337,"00:20:21,805","00:20:23,974","Because Drago Bludvist
is a madman..."
338,"00:20:24,141","00:20:26,310",without conscience or mercy.
339,"00:20:26,476","00:20:31,023","And if he's built a dragon
army, gods help us all."
340,"00:20:31,189","00:20:32,858","Get them into their pens!
Quickly!"
341,"00:20:33,025","00:20:34,860","Then, let's ride back out there."
342,"00:20:35,027","00:20:37,087","We'll follow those
trappers to Drago"
343,"00:20:37,112","00:20:38,363",and talk some sense into him.
344,"00:20:38,530","00:20:40,324",No. We fortify the island.
345,"00:20:40,490","00:20:42,034",It's our duty to keep the peace!
346,"00:20:42,200","00:20:45,579","Peace is over, Hiccup.
I must prepare you for war."
347,"00:20:45,746","00:20:46,788",War?
348,"00:20:46,955","00:20:49,458","Dad, if Drago is
coming for our dragons..."
349,"00:20:49,625","00:20:52,002","we can't wait around
for him to get here."
350,"00:20:52,169","00:20:55,213","Let's go find him
and change his mind."
351,"00:20:55,380","00:20:57,424","No, some minds won't
be changed, Hiccup."
352,"00:20:57,591","00:20:59,843","Berk is what you
need to worry about."
353,"00:21:00,010","00:21:02,387",A chief protects his own.
354,"00:21:03,847","00:21:06,350","Secure the stables!
Latch every stall!"
355,"00:21:06,516","00:21:08,435","Hiccup, don't!
I have to."
356,"00:21:08,602","00:21:09,645",This way!
357,"00:21:09,811","00:21:11,021",Quickly!
358,"00:21:12,731","00:21:14,333",Hiccup!
359,"00:21:16,026","00:21:17,069",Come on!
360,"00:21:18,737","00:21:20,405",Hiccup!
361,"00:21:30,791","00:21:32,918","Keep your eyes peeled, lads!"
362,"00:21:33,085","00:21:35,796","With this wind, we'll reach
Drago by daybreak..."
363,"00:21:35,963","00:21:39,508","so best we fill this ship up
with dragons, and quick!"
364,"00:21:39,675","00:21:41,218",It's no time to be picky.
365,"00:21:41,385","00:21:42,636",Eret?
366,"00:21:42,761","00:21:44,012",Not if we want to keep our...
367,"00:21:45,389","00:21:48,433","...heads!
Off the port quarter!"
368,"00:21:48,600","00:21:50,811","Net them, lads!
Take them down!"
369,"00:21:54,898","00:21:56,400","You're not
getting away this time."
370,"00:21:56,942","00:21:57,943",Fire!
371,"00:21:59,194","00:22:00,612",Reload!
372,"00:22:00,779","00:22:02,447",Reload! Incoming!
373,"00:22:05,200","00:22:06,201",And here I was...
374,"00:22:06,368","00:22:08,537","worried we might
turn up empty-handed."
375,"00:22:08,704","00:22:10,555","Nope.
It's your lucky day."
376,"00:22:10,580","00:22:12,249",We give up.
377,"00:22:13,875","00:22:17,754","That's one Night Fury,
one Deadly Nadder..."
378,"00:22:17,921","00:22:20,924","and two of the finest
dragon riders west of Luk Tuk."
379,"00:22:21,216","00:22:23,443","That ought to make
the boss happy, right?"
380,"00:22:23,468","00:22:25,262",Excuse us.
381,"00:22:25,429","00:22:26,488",What are you doing?
382,"00:22:26,513","00:22:28,432","Toothless, stay."
383,"00:22:29,808","00:22:32,577","The dragons don't
care for cramped spaces,"
384,"00:22:32,602","00:22:34,104","so they'll just
hang out with you."
385,"00:22:34,271","00:22:35,914",They won't be any trouble.
386,"00:22:37,315","00:22:39,026",Unless you do that.
387,"00:22:39,192","00:22:43,196","You know, wooden boat, big ocean.
How is your swimming?"
388,"00:22:43,363","00:22:45,382",Not good.
389,"00:22:46,616","00:22:50,120","Oops! Almost forgot. You
can't have armed prisoners."
390,"00:22:50,287","00:22:51,872",How is this a plan?
391,"00:22:52,039","00:22:54,708","Just what every
dragon trapper needs."
392,"00:22:54,875","00:22:58,086","One end coats the blade
in Monstrous Nightmare saliva."
393,"00:22:58,253","00:23:00,964","The other sprays
Hideous Zippleback gas."
394,"00:23:01,131","00:23:03,859","All it takes is a spark, and..."
395,"00:23:05,969","00:23:07,387","Yeah, there you go."
396,"00:23:07,721","00:23:09,656","Once they see you
as one of their own..."
397,"00:23:09,681","00:23:11,892","even the testiest
dragons can be trained."
398,"00:23:12,059","00:23:13,118","Right, bud?"
399,"00:23:13,143","00:23:15,062",Give me that!
400,"00:23:16,063","00:23:18,023",What game are you playing?
401,"00:23:18,190","00:23:20,292","No game.
We just wanna meet Drago."
402,"00:23:20,317","00:23:21,359",Why?
403,"00:23:21,526","00:23:24,463","Because I'm going to change
his mind about dragons."
404,"00:23:27,991","00:23:29,951",He can be really persuasive.
405,"00:23:30,118","00:23:31,453","Once you've
earned his loyalty..."
406,"00:23:31,620","00:23:34,139","there is nothing
a dragon won't do for you."
407,"00:23:34,164","00:23:37,292","You won't be
changing any minds around here."
408,"00:23:37,459","00:23:38,835",I can change yours.
409,"00:23:39,002","00:23:40,921",Right here. Right now.
410,"00:23:44,007","00:23:45,050",May I?
411,"00:23:49,763","00:23:51,348",Dragon riders!
412,"00:23:58,271","00:23:59,356",Put me down!
413,"00:23:59,523","00:24:01,900","Snotlout, what are you doing?"
414,"00:24:02,067","00:24:03,485","See how well I
protect and provide?"
415,"00:24:04,903","00:24:05,987",What is with all the nets?
416,"00:24:06,113","00:24:07,614","Hey, watch it!
That was..."
417,"00:24:07,781","00:24:10,200",close.
418,"00:24:12,869","00:24:15,247",My.
419,"00:24:17,874","00:24:20,252",Me likey.
420,"00:24:23,713","00:24:25,215",Take me.
421,"00:24:29,094","00:24:30,387",Hold your fire!
422,"00:24:33,974","00:24:36,935",What are you guys doing here?
423,"00:24:37,102","00:24:39,146",We're here to rescue you!
424,"00:24:39,312","00:24:40,856",I don't need to be rescued!
425,"00:24:41,022","00:24:42,315",Enough!
426,"00:24:44,651","00:24:48,071","Well, didn't you just
pick the wrong ship?"
427,"00:24:48,321","00:24:50,824","I am Eret, son of Eret."
428,"00:24:51,616","00:24:53,577",I'm...
429,"00:24:54,953","00:24:57,164",Get this thing off me.
430,"00:24:57,330","00:24:58,748",Anyone else?
431,"00:24:59,791","00:25:00,792",That's what I figured.
432,"00:25:00,959","00:25:03,920","You, saddle up.
We're going home."
433,"00:25:04,087","00:25:05,130",No.
434,"00:25:06,131","00:25:07,841",Of all the irresponsible...
435,"00:25:08,008","00:25:10,802","I'm trying to protect our
dragons and stop a war!"
436,"00:25:10,969","00:25:12,262",How is that irresponsible?
437,"00:25:12,429","00:25:14,806","Because war is
what he wants, son!"
438,"00:25:20,854","00:25:23,440","Years ago, there was a great
gathering of chieftains..."
439,"00:25:23,607","00:25:26,359","to discuss the dragon
scourge we all faced."
440,"00:25:26,568","00:25:30,822","Into our midst came a stranger
from a strange land..."
441,"00:25:30,989","00:25:34,868","covered in scars and draped
in a cloak of dragon skin."
442,"00:25:35,660","00:25:37,829",He carried no weapon...
443,"00:25:37,996","00:25:40,415","and spoke softly,
saying that he..."
444,"00:25:41,124","00:25:44,628","Drago Bludvist,
was a man of the people..."
445,"00:25:44,794","00:25:48,798","devoted to freeing mankind
from the tyranny of dragons."
446,"00:25:49,466","00:25:51,593","He claimed that he alone
could control the dragons..."
447,"00:25:51,760","00:25:55,096","and that he alone
could keep us safe..."
448,"00:25:56,014","00:25:57,390",if we chose to bow down...
449,"00:25:57,807","00:25:59,809",and follow him.
450,"00:26:02,437","00:26:04,439","Stupid.
Good one."
451,"00:26:04,606","00:26:06,691","Aye, we laughed, too."
452,"00:26:06,858","00:26:09,611","Until he wrapped himself in
his cloak and cried out..."
453,"00:26:09,778","00:26:12,489","""Then see how well
you do without me!"""
454,"00:26:13,531","00:26:16,201","The rooftop suddenly
burst into flames..."
455,"00:26:16,368","00:26:19,788","and from it,
armored dragons descended..."
456,"00:26:20,247","00:26:22,249",burning the hall to the ground.
457,"00:26:23,917","00:26:24,918",I...
458,"00:26:26,086","00:26:28,672",was the only one to escape.
459,"00:26:33,426","00:26:37,180","Men who kill without reason
cannot be reasoned with."
460,"00:26:37,347","00:26:39,015","Maybe.
Hiccup!"
461,"00:26:39,182","00:26:40,684",I'm still going to try.
462,"00:26:43,270","00:26:44,771",This is what I'm good at.
463,"00:26:44,938","00:26:47,607","And if I could
change your mind..."
464,"00:26:47,774","00:26:49,484","I can change his, too."
465,"00:26:51,027","00:26:52,195",Come on.
466,"00:26:53,571","00:26:54,698","- Let's go.
- No!"
467,"00:26:54,864","00:26:56,866",Lead the others back to Berk.
468,"00:26:57,033","00:26:59,160","I've had enough
mutiny for one day."
469,"00:27:01,830","00:27:04,207",I like that.
470,"00:27:04,332","00:27:05,392",Ruffnut!
471,"00:27:05,417","00:27:07,085",Okay!
472,"00:27:26,688","00:27:29,357","Don't worry, bud."
473,"00:27:29,733","00:27:32,193","I'm not gonna let
anything happen to you."
474,"00:27:32,861","00:27:34,571",I promise.
475,"00:27:42,287","00:27:43,830","Come on, Dad!"
476,"00:27:43,997","00:27:45,290",Really?
477,"00:27:53,673","00:27:55,133",Okay.
478,"00:27:55,842","00:27:57,635",No sudden moves.
479,"00:28:21,743","00:28:23,286",Hold on. Hold on.
480,"00:28:35,048","00:28:36,508",Toothless!
481,"00:29:25,890","00:29:29,102","Hey! You left my
dragon back there!"
482,"00:29:29,269","00:29:31,604","He can't fly on his own!
He will drown!"
483,"00:29:53,626","00:29:54,627",Hey!
484,"00:29:55,378","00:29:57,797","We have to head
back for my dragon!"
485,"00:30:43,968","00:30:45,428",Who are you?
486,"00:30:46,429","00:30:48,014",The dragon thief?
487,"00:30:50,475","00:30:51,976",Drago Bludvist?
488,"00:30:53,353","00:30:55,897","Do you even understand
what I'm saying?"
489,"00:31:03,321","00:31:05,907","Toothless! It's okay,
it's okay, it's okay."
490,"00:31:06,074","00:31:08,034","I'm glad to see you, too, bud."
491,"00:31:08,201","00:31:10,662","You really had
me worried, there."
492,"00:31:56,416","00:31:57,625",Hiccup?
493,"00:32:02,505","00:32:04,132",Could it be?
494,"00:32:05,174","00:32:07,552",After all these years?
495,"00:32:07,927","00:32:09,637",How is this possible?
496,"00:32:10,138","00:32:11,264",Should I...
497,"00:32:12,599","00:32:13,933",Should I know you?
498,"00:32:14,809","00:32:17,562","No, you were only a babe."
499,"00:32:23,067","00:32:26,154",But a mother never forgets.
500,"00:32:33,828","00:32:35,121",Come.
501,"00:32:36,080","00:32:38,583","Boar-headed!
Just like his mother!"
502,"00:32:38,750","00:32:40,585","Aye, she could
never stay put either."
503,"00:32:40,752","00:32:42,045",He's just twenty.
504,"00:32:42,211","00:32:44,839","And a Viking. Could there
be a worse combination?"
505,"00:32:45,882","00:32:49,886","When I think of how stubborn and
senseless you were back in the day..."
506,"00:32:52,597","00:32:54,932","Well, not much
has changed, actually."
507,"00:32:55,933","00:32:58,328",You know what he's like.
508,"00:32:58,353","00:33:00,063","He won't give up, Gobber."
509,"00:33:00,897","00:33:04,984","And if Hiccup finds Drago,
before we find him..."
510,"00:33:05,401","00:33:06,694",Nothing can hurt Hiccup...
511,"00:33:06,861","00:33:10,239","so long as that Night Fury's around.
It's a Night Fury!"
512,"00:33:30,551","00:33:31,552","Find them, Skullcrusher."
513,"00:33:33,429","00:33:35,682",Find them.
514,"00:33:42,105","00:33:43,690","Hold on.
Wait just a minute."
515,"00:33:43,856","00:33:44,957","This way!
Come back here!"
516,"00:33:44,982","00:33:46,042",Come.
517,"00:33:46,067","00:33:49,112","You can't just say something
like that and run off!"
518,"00:33:49,320","00:33:51,698","You're my mother?
I mean, what the..."
519,"00:33:52,198","00:33:54,158","Do you grasp how
insane it sounds?"
520,"00:33:54,450","00:33:55,468","Come, quickly!"
521,"00:33:55,493","00:33:57,620",I have questions!
522,"00:33:58,538","00:34:00,498","Where have you
been all this time?"
523,"00:34:01,874","00:34:03,710",What have you been doing?
524,"00:34:04,377","00:34:06,671",But they said you were dead!
525,"00:34:06,838","00:34:10,024","Everyone thinks
you were eaten by..."
526,"00:34:49,881","00:34:52,967","This is where you've
been for 20 years?"
527,"00:34:56,095","00:34:57,930",You've been rescuing them.
528,"00:35:01,517","00:35:02,602",Unbelievable.
529,"00:35:02,769","00:35:04,270",You're not upset?
530,"00:35:04,437","00:35:06,689","What? No.
I don't know."
531,"00:35:06,856","00:35:09,025","It's a bit much to get my
head around, to be frank."
532,"00:35:09,192","00:35:10,735","It's not every
day you find out..."
533,"00:35:10,902","00:35:14,172","your mother is some
kind of crazy, feral,"
534,"00:35:14,197","00:35:16,048",vigilante dragon lady.
535,"00:35:19,786","00:35:23,372","At least I'm not boring, right?"
536,"00:35:23,539","00:35:28,211","I suppose there is
that one specific thing."
537,"00:35:28,377","00:35:30,421",Do you like it?
538,"00:35:32,840","00:35:34,509",I don't have the words.
539,"00:35:43,684","00:35:44,977",Can I...
540,"00:35:45,561","00:35:47,313",He's beautiful.
541,"00:35:51,359","00:35:53,027",Incredible!
542,"00:35:54,195","00:35:57,156","He might very well
be the last of his kind."
543,"00:35:57,323","00:36:00,034","And look, he's your age."
544,"00:36:00,201","00:36:01,344",Wow.
545,"00:36:01,369","00:36:03,221",No wonder you get along so well.
546,"00:36:06,249","00:36:09,293",And retractable teeth!
547,"00:36:10,378","00:36:11,813",How did you manage to...
548,"00:36:11,838","00:36:13,297",I found him in the woods.
549,"00:36:13,464","00:36:16,592",He was shot down and wounded.
550,"00:36:20,847","00:36:25,685","This Snafflefang lost his leg to one
of Drago Bludvist's iron traps."
551,"00:36:26,102","00:36:29,230","This Raincutter had her wing
sliced by razor netting."
552,"00:36:29,647","00:36:31,691",And this poor Hobblegrunt...
553,"00:36:32,400","00:36:34,819",was blinded by a tree snare...
554,"00:36:34,986","00:36:37,864","and then left to
die alone and scared."
555,"00:36:38,948","00:36:39,991",And what of this?
556,"00:36:40,491","00:36:43,094","Did Drago or his
trappers do this, too?"
557,"00:36:43,119","00:36:45,580",Yeah...
558,"00:36:47,123","00:36:49,250",The crazy thing is...
559,"00:36:49,917","00:36:53,588","I'm actually the one
who shot him down."
560,"00:36:54,255","00:36:56,132","Hey, it's okay, though."
561,"00:36:56,299","00:36:57,425",He got me back!
562,"00:36:57,592","00:36:58,843","Right, bud?"
563,"00:36:59,010","00:37:00,720","You couldn't save
all of me, could you?"
564,"00:37:00,887","00:37:02,388",You just had to make it even.
565,"00:37:02,555","00:37:05,308","So, peg leg!"
566,"00:37:11,230","00:37:14,275","What did your father think
of your Night Fury friend?"
567,"00:37:14,442","00:37:16,652",He didn't take it all that well.
568,"00:37:17,403","00:37:20,031",But then he changed.
569,"00:37:20,615","00:37:22,533",They all did.
570,"00:37:22,700","00:37:25,494","Pretty soon, everyone back
home had dragons of their own."
571,"00:37:26,370","00:37:28,456","If only it were possible.
No, really."
572,"00:37:28,623","00:37:30,791","Believe me, I tried, as well..."
573,"00:37:30,958","00:37:33,920","but people are not
capable of change, Hiccup."
574,"00:37:34,462","00:37:38,524","Some of us were
just born different."
575,"00:37:42,094","00:37:44,472",Hoist the torches!
576,"00:37:45,806","00:37:48,976","Berk was a land of
""kill-or-be-killed""..."
577,"00:37:49,143","00:37:51,829","but I believed
peace was possible."
578,"00:37:52,980","00:37:55,691","Stop! You'll only
make it worse!"
579,"00:37:56,859","00:37:59,503",It was a very unpopular opinion.
580,"00:37:59,528","00:38:01,739",Hiccup!
581,"00:38:02,490","00:38:06,410","Then, one night, a
dragon broke into our house..."
582,"00:38:06,577","00:38:08,955",finding you in the cradle.
583,"00:38:10,206","00:38:12,350",I rushed to protect you.
584,"00:38:17,004","00:38:18,965",But what I saw...
585,"00:38:19,131","00:38:21,300","was proof of
everything I believed."
586,"00:38:34,188","00:38:36,649",This wasn't a vicious beast...
587,"00:38:36,816","00:38:39,735","but an intelligent,
gentle creature..."
588,"00:38:40,277","00:38:41,487",whose soul...
589,"00:38:41,654","00:38:43,322",reflected my own.
590,"00:38:45,449","00:38:46,534","Valka, run!"
591,"00:38:46,701","00:38:48,869",No! Don't!
592,"00:38:53,207","00:38:54,225",Hold on!
593,"00:38:56,711","00:38:58,212",No! Stoick!
594,"00:38:58,379","00:38:59,755",Valka!
595,"00:39:01,507","00:39:03,134",Stoick!
596,"00:39:05,136","00:39:06,345",Valka.
597,"00:39:08,139","00:39:11,600","You and your father
nearly died that night..."
598,"00:39:11,767","00:39:14,687","all because I couldn't
kill a dragon."
599,"00:39:15,563","00:39:17,898",It runs in the family.
600,"00:39:18,065","00:39:20,484","It broke my heart
to stay away..."
601,"00:39:20,651","00:39:23,529","but I believed you would
be safer if I did."
602,"00:39:25,448","00:39:26,574",How did you survive?
603,"00:39:26,907","00:39:29,660","Cloudjumper never
meant to harm me."
604,"00:39:29,827","00:39:33,039","He must have thought
I belonged here."
605,"00:39:33,664","00:39:37,918","In the home of
the great Bewilderbeast."
606,"00:39:38,085","00:39:40,421",The alpha species.
607,"00:39:40,588","00:39:43,716","One of the very
few that still exist."
608,"00:39:46,385","00:39:47,720",Every nest has its queen...
609,"00:39:47,887","00:39:51,807","but this is
the king of all dragons."
610,"00:39:52,141","00:39:56,562","With his icy breath, this
graceful giant built our nest."
611,"00:39:56,771","00:39:59,607","A safe haven for
dragons everywhere."
612,"00:40:00,483","00:40:02,610","Wait,
that's the ice-spitter?"
613,"00:40:02,777","00:40:04,945","He's responsible for
all that destruction?"
614,"00:40:05,112","00:40:06,947",He protects us.
615,"00:40:07,448","00:40:11,177","We all live under his care
and his command."
616,"00:40:14,163","00:40:16,582","All but the babies, of course..."
617,"00:40:19,043","00:40:20,770",...who listen to no one!
618,"00:40:34,558","00:40:36,519",I've lived among them...
619,"00:40:36,685","00:40:38,145","for 20 years, Hiccup..."
620,"00:40:38,312","00:40:39,480",discovering their secrets.
621,"00:40:43,776","00:40:45,778","He likes you.
Wow."
622,"00:40:46,695","00:40:48,364",You must be hungry.
623,"00:40:48,531","00:40:49,715","Yeah, I could eat."
624,"00:40:49,740","00:40:52,451","Good.
It's feeding time."
625,"00:41:01,627","00:41:03,045",I don't like it.
626,"00:41:03,212","00:41:04,755","They should have been
back with Hiccup by now."
627,"00:41:04,922","00:41:06,966","I don't like it either.
Eret, son of Eret..."
628,"00:41:07,133","00:41:10,302","was the man of my dreams.
My everything!"
629,"00:41:10,469","00:41:12,763","But, baby,
I grew facial hair for you."
630,"00:41:13,222","00:41:14,431","Me, too."
631,"00:41:14,598","00:41:16,392",What if Drago shot them down?
632,"00:41:16,559","00:41:18,853",What if they need our help?
633,"00:41:19,311","00:41:20,771",We have to find them.
634,"00:41:20,938","00:41:22,314","Wait, what?
No, but Stoick said..."
635,"00:41:22,481","00:41:24,333","It doesn't matter what he said,"
636,"00:41:24,358","00:41:25,558",if they have all been captured.
637,"00:41:25,568","00:41:26,569",Come on!
638,"00:41:30,489","00:41:31,699",Do we go back?
639,"00:41:31,866","00:41:34,827","We have nowhere to
go, nothing to sell..."
640,"00:41:35,077","00:41:36,787",and no heads to call our own!
641,"00:41:36,954","00:41:40,416","If we don't turn up with
dragons, and fast..."
642,"00:41:41,876","00:41:44,545",Careful what you wish for!
643,"00:41:44,712","00:41:46,213","Eret, son of Eret!"
644,"00:41:46,714","00:41:48,591","What is this?
A kidnapping."
645,"00:41:48,757","00:41:51,694","- Yay! Can he ride with me?
- Can he? Can he?"
646,"00:41:53,012","00:41:54,847","You're gonna show
us the way to Drago."
647,"00:41:55,014","00:41:59,185","And help dragon riders sneak into
Drago's camp? Just kill me now."
648,"00:41:59,351","00:42:01,954","That could be arranged.
Stormfly, drop it!"
649,"00:42:04,523","00:42:05,900",Good girl!
650,"00:42:06,483","00:42:08,277","Stormfly, fetch!"
651,"00:42:09,111","00:42:10,905",All right!
652,"00:42:11,071","00:42:13,949","Okay! I'll take
you to Drago!"
653,"00:42:16,660","00:42:18,787",Works every time.
654,"00:42:26,045","00:42:28,339","Hey, I thought we
were going to eat."
655,"00:42:28,505","00:42:29,882",We are.
656,"00:43:01,455","00:43:03,040","Then, from Dragon Island..."
657,"00:43:03,207","00:43:04,250",I found this archipelago.
658,"00:43:11,507","00:43:12,967",There.
659,"00:43:13,467","00:43:15,803",Whoa!
660,"00:43:32,361","00:43:34,446",Whoo-hoo!
661,"00:44:05,394","00:44:07,146",When I'm up here...
662,"00:44:07,313","00:44:10,566","I don't even feel the cold.
I just feel..."
663,"00:44:10,983","00:44:12,276",Free.
664,"00:44:15,696","00:44:20,576","This is what it
is to be a dragon, Hiccup."
665,"00:44:20,993","00:44:23,954","It's all well and good
to call yourself a dragon..."
666,"00:44:24,121","00:44:25,289",but can you fly?
667,"00:44:46,810","00:44:48,020",No!
668,"00:44:56,070","00:44:57,738",Ha!
669,"00:44:59,156","00:45:00,574",Man! Almost!
670,"00:45:01,325","00:45:03,827",We just about had it that time!
671,"00:45:08,290","00:45:09,792",Incredible.
672,"00:45:10,376","00:45:12,711","Well, not bad yourself."
673,"00:45:22,513","00:45:25,557","All this time,
you took after me."
674,"00:45:26,475","00:45:29,353",And where was I?
675,"00:45:31,397","00:45:33,732","I'm so sorry, Hiccup."
676,"00:45:33,899","00:45:36,568",Can we start over?
677,"00:45:40,322","00:45:41,990",Will you give me another chance?
678,"00:45:45,786","00:45:49,790","I can teach you all that I have
learned these past 20 years."
679,"00:45:49,957","00:45:51,667",Like...
680,"00:45:56,130","00:45:57,231",Wow.
681,"00:45:57,256","00:45:59,800","Now you can make
those tight turns."
682,"00:46:02,553","00:46:04,388",Did you know about this?
683,"00:46:05,389","00:46:08,350",Every dragon has its secrets.
684,"00:46:08,517","00:46:11,061",And I'll show them all to you.
685,"00:46:11,228","00:46:12,813",We'll unlock every mystery...
686,"00:46:12,980","00:46:15,899","find every last
species together..."
687,"00:46:16,066","00:46:17,568",as mother and son.
688,"00:46:22,739","00:46:27,077","This gift we share,
Hiccup, it bonds us."
689,"00:46:27,828","00:46:31,039","This is who you are, son."
690,"00:46:31,206","00:46:32,749",Who we are.
691,"00:46:32,916","00:46:36,587","We will change the world
for all dragons."
692,"00:46:36,753","00:46:39,506","We will make it a better,
safer place."
693,"00:46:39,673","00:46:41,300",Yeah.
694,"00:46:41,467","00:46:43,552",That sounds amazing.
695,"00:46:55,856","00:46:57,691",This is so great!
696,"00:46:57,858","00:47:00,569","Now you and I can
go talk to Drago together."
697,"00:47:00,736","00:47:01,904",What?
698,"00:47:02,488","00:47:04,281",There's no talking to Drago.
699,"00:47:04,448","00:47:05,699","But we have to...
No."
700,"00:47:05,824","00:47:07,534",We must protect our own.
701,"00:47:08,660","00:47:10,704","Come on,
we should be getting back."
702,"00:47:25,761","00:47:29,056","Okay! Look, I got you here.
Now get this thing off me."
703,"00:47:29,223","00:47:31,099",Never take a toy from a dragon.
704,"00:47:31,266","00:47:33,994",Don't you know anything?
705,"00:47:34,019","00:47:36,563","Why does this
keep happening to me?"
706,"00:47:50,869","00:47:52,496",What's down there?
707,"00:47:54,289","00:47:57,209","Large diameter bubbles,
massive lungs..."
708,"00:47:57,376","00:47:59,503",cold water deep dweller.
709,"00:47:59,670","00:48:03,173","I'm thinking class five
leviathan, maybe six."
710,"00:48:18,021","00:48:19,706","Meatlug!
What's wrong, girl?"
711,"00:48:37,791","00:48:39,835",Drago!
712,"00:48:43,130","00:48:44,506",Get off me!
713,"00:48:46,466","00:48:49,011","Always great
to see you, my friend!"
714,"00:48:49,177","00:48:50,804",Keeping warm up here?
715,"00:48:54,516","00:48:57,244","As you can see,
I'm right on time"
716,"00:48:57,269","00:48:58,729",with a new batch of dragons...
717,"00:48:58,895","00:49:00,063",just like I promised.
718,"00:49:00,230","00:49:01,898",He's waking up!
719,"00:49:02,190","00:49:03,275","Give me some backup, here!"
720,"00:49:05,152","00:49:06,320",Drop the ropes!
721,"00:49:39,603","00:49:40,937","- Hookfang!
- Hey!"
722,"00:49:41,104","00:49:42,439",What are you doing?
723,"00:49:42,773","00:49:46,443",You belong to me now.
724,"00:49:47,903","00:49:49,780",And as an added bonus...
725,"00:49:49,946","00:49:51,615",I also caught you their riders.
726,"00:49:52,074","00:49:54,117","No extra charge.
What?"
727,"00:49:54,284","00:49:55,661","Are you kidding me?
Aw!"
728,"00:49:55,827","00:49:57,621",But you were so perfect!
729,"00:49:57,788","00:50:00,165","Turns out, there is a whole
bunch of them out there."
730,"00:50:02,793","00:50:03,852",How many?
731,"00:50:03,877","00:50:05,712","Drago doesn't
have them after all."
732,"00:50:06,505","00:50:07,756","- How many?
- Hundreds."
733,"00:50:07,923","00:50:09,383",A whole island full!
734,"00:50:09,758","00:50:11,385",I wouldn't worry about it.
735,"00:50:11,551","00:50:14,680","My men are hunting
them down as we speak."
736,"00:50:14,846","00:50:17,683","They won't know where you're
hiding, I promise you that."
737,"00:50:17,849","00:50:19,893","Yes, they will.
They know we're missing..."
738,"00:50:20,060","00:50:22,020",and they have tracking dragons.
739,"00:50:22,187","00:50:24,606","If you so much as touch us,
Hiccup is gonna kick..."
740,"00:50:24,773","00:50:26,566","- Hiccup?
- He's not a problem."
741,"00:50:26,733","00:50:28,652",Really. Trust me.
742,"00:50:28,819","00:50:31,088","He's only the son
of Stoick the Vast,"
743,"00:50:31,113","00:50:32,906","his heir to
the throne of Berk..."
744,"00:50:33,073","00:50:36,576","and the greatest dragon master
this world has ever seen!"
745,"00:50:36,743","00:50:38,620",Dragon master?
746,"00:50:38,787","00:50:42,165",I alone control the dragons!
747,"00:50:42,332","00:50:44,167","No.
Sorry."
748,"00:50:44,835","00:50:47,629","And unless you let
us go, right now..."
749,"00:50:48,213","00:50:50,053","he will blast through here
on his Night Fury..."
750,"00:50:50,590","00:50:54,094","and blow your entire fleet
of ships to splinters."
751,"00:50:54,261","00:50:55,701","Then they will be
crying like babies."
752,"00:50:56,513","00:50:57,572",Funny and beautiful.
753,"00:50:57,597","00:50:58,598","Good one, babe!"
754,"00:50:59,015","00:51:01,226","Like babies, they always cry."
755,"00:51:01,393","00:51:02,936",Real tiny ones.
756,"00:51:03,103","00:51:07,607","First, there was one rider,
and now, all of Berk."
757,"00:51:08,275","00:51:10,485",And you led them to me!
758,"00:51:12,112","00:51:13,213",Drago!
759,"00:51:13,238","00:51:15,782",Stop all preparations!
760,"00:51:15,949","00:51:20,036","We must attack the dragon
riders' nest at once!"
761,"00:51:20,203","00:51:23,832",We will take down their alpha!
762,"00:51:23,999","00:51:27,519",Then we will take Berk!
763,"00:51:29,171","00:51:30,272",Drago.
764,"00:51:30,297","00:51:31,798",And get rid of him.
765,"00:51:32,591","00:51:34,593","Drago, please, I..."
766,"00:51:39,848","00:51:41,016",Stormfly!
767,"00:51:45,604","00:51:47,022",No!
768,"00:51:58,742","00:52:01,178","Well, bud, we can't wait around"
769,"00:52:01,203","00:52:03,622",for Drago to attack this place.
770,"00:52:03,789","00:52:05,373",We've gotta find him first.
771,"00:52:13,048","00:52:14,758",Let's go.
772,"00:52:16,051","00:52:17,552",Easy now.
773,"00:52:17,719","00:52:19,554","Are you kidding me?
How did you get in here?"
774,"00:52:19,721","00:52:21,121","The same way we
are getting you out."
775,"00:52:21,264","00:52:22,849","We?
All clear."
776,"00:52:23,016","00:52:24,059","Toothless, come."
777,"00:52:24,309","00:52:27,187","Wait. There's something
you need to know."
778,"00:52:27,354","00:52:28,594","Yeah, yeah, tell me on the way."
779,"00:52:28,647","00:52:31,525","This isn't an on-the-way
kind of update, actually."
780,"00:52:31,691","00:52:32,734",I've heard enough.
781,"00:52:32,901","00:52:35,529","More of the
earth-shattering-development variety."
782,"00:52:35,695","00:52:37,781","Yeah, just add it to the pile."
783,"00:52:39,366","00:52:43,553","Dad, unlike most surprises I spring
on you, this is one you'll like."
784,"00:52:43,578","00:52:44,596",I promise.
785,"00:52:44,621","00:52:46,623","You just have to
handle it delicately."
786,"00:52:50,168","00:52:53,688",You might want to take this one.
787,"00:52:55,799","00:52:57,050",Boy.
788,"00:52:58,844","00:52:59,903",Dad...
789,"00:52:59,928","00:53:02,430","could you put
the sword away, please?"
790,"00:53:14,442","00:53:17,404","I know what you're
gonna say, Stoick."
791,"00:53:18,321","00:53:20,323",How could I have done this?
792,"00:53:21,533","00:53:23,285",Stayed away all of these years?
793,"00:53:23,451","00:53:25,370","And why did I not
come back to you?"
794,"00:53:25,537","00:53:27,080",To our son?
795,"00:53:28,832","00:53:32,377","What sign did I have that
you could change, Stoick?"
796,"00:53:32,544","00:53:34,546",That anyone on Berk could?
797,"00:53:35,338","00:53:38,717","I pleaded so many times
to stop the fighting..."
798,"00:53:38,884","00:53:41,386","to find another answer,
but did any of you listen?"
799,"00:53:41,553","00:53:43,388",This is why I never married.
800,"00:53:43,555","00:53:46,182",This and one other reason.
801,"00:53:47,100","00:53:50,520","I know that I left you
to raise Hiccup alone..."
802,"00:53:50,687","00:53:53,356","but I thought he would be
better off without me."
803,"00:53:53,773","00:53:56,902","And I was wrong,
I see that now, but..."
804,"00:53:58,945","00:54:01,114","Stop being so stoic, Stoick!"
805,"00:54:01,281","00:54:02,490",Go on.
806,"00:54:02,657","00:54:05,535","Shout, scream, say something!"
807,"00:54:10,040","00:54:13,710","You're as beautiful
as the day I lost you."
808,"00:54:47,869","00:54:49,262",Could this day get any worse?
809,"00:54:49,287","00:54:50,388",Let me see.
810,"00:54:50,413","00:54:53,291","We're gonna jump into freezing cold
water, and then die from drowning."
811,"00:54:53,458","00:54:54,876",Looks refreshing.
812,"00:54:55,335","00:54:57,087","Please, ladies first."
813,"00:54:58,296","00:55:01,174","You are a steaming
heap of dragon..."
814,"00:55:01,341","00:55:02,926",Duck.
815,"00:55:06,179","00:55:07,197",Warn the others!
816,"00:55:07,222","00:55:08,848","Get them, you son of an Eret."
817,"00:55:11,059","00:55:12,060",Take that!
818,"00:55:19,067","00:55:20,527","Okay, I love you again."
819,"00:55:21,277","00:55:23,655","Pathetic.
You can still jump."
820,"00:55:23,822","00:55:26,758","So, are we going to save your dragons
and get out of here, or not?"
821,"00:55:27,993","00:55:30,954","Check every trap.
They're here somewhere."
822,"00:55:40,505","00:55:42,732",Meatlug?
823,"00:55:42,757","00:55:44,592",Anyone coming?
824,"00:55:44,759","00:55:46,839","I don't know. You just keep
doing what you are doing."
825,"00:55:47,470","00:55:49,347",Keep cranking.
826,"00:56:06,072","00:56:09,034",Thank you for saving my life.
827,"00:56:13,288","00:56:15,081",Now let me return the favor.
828,"00:56:16,166","00:56:19,002","Mom, you'd never
even recognize it."
829,"00:56:19,169","00:56:22,464","Where we used to make weapons, we
now build saddles, wing-slings."
830,"00:56:22,630","00:56:24,799",We even fix dragon teeth!
831,"00:56:24,966","00:56:27,052","You wouldn't believe how
much everything's changed."
832,"00:56:27,218","00:56:29,804","Our son has changed
Berk for the better."
833,"00:56:29,971","00:56:31,598","I think we did well
with this one, Val."
834,"00:56:31,765","00:56:32,891","Thanks, Dad."
835,"00:56:34,100","00:56:35,994",I got it. I got it.
836,"00:56:47,906","00:56:50,950",I'm a little out of practice.
837,"00:56:51,117","00:56:52,911","Well, you know..."
838,"00:56:53,078","00:56:55,705","- I didn't marry you for your cooking.
- I hope not."
839,"00:56:55,872","00:56:59,459","Her meatballs could kill more
beasts than a battle-axe."
840,"00:56:59,626","00:57:02,295","I've still got a few knocking
around in here."
841,"00:57:02,462","00:57:05,006","And once you move back in,
with all your dragons..."
842,"00:57:05,173","00:57:07,300",Drago won't even stand a chance.
843,"00:57:07,467","00:57:09,219",Everything will be okay!
844,"00:57:09,385","00:57:13,098","Slow down, son.
It's a lot to take in."
845,"00:57:13,556","00:57:15,308",Gotcha.
846,"00:57:22,941","00:57:25,360",I love this one.
847,"00:57:41,084","00:57:43,253","Remember our song, Val?"
848,"00:57:44,671","00:57:50,844","I'll swim and
sail on savage seas"
849,"00:57:52,595","00:57:56,933",With ne'er a fear of drowning
850,"00:57:58,685","00:58:03,690","And gladly ride
the waves of life"
851,"00:58:05,400","00:58:09,696",If you will marry me
852,"00:58:11,990","00:58:14,534",No scorching sun
853,"00:58:14,701","00:58:18,329",Nor freezing cold Will stop...
854,"00:58:18,496","00:58:21,875",Will stop me on my journey
855,"00:58:22,041","00:58:23,585",Sorry.
856,"00:58:26,129","00:58:31,718","If you will
promise me your heart"
857,"00:58:36,181","00:58:38,016",And love...
858,"00:58:43,521","00:58:49,944",And love me for eternity
859,"00:58:51,946","00:58:53,656",My dearest one
860,"00:58:53,823","00:58:55,825",My darling dear
861,"00:58:55,992","00:59:00,038",Your mighty words astound me
862,"00:59:00,205","00:59:03,333",But I've no need of mighty deeds
863,"00:59:03,499","00:59:06,753",When I feel your arms around me
864,"00:59:06,920","00:59:09,255","But I would bring
you rings of gold"
865,"00:59:09,422","00:59:10,690",I'd even sing you poetry
866,"00:59:10,715","00:59:11,716","Whoo!
Would you?"
867,"00:59:12,300","00:59:14,469","And I would keep
you from all harm"
868,"00:59:14,636","00:59:17,305",If you would stay beside me
869,"00:59:17,472","00:59:20,225",I have no use for rings of gold
870,"00:59:20,391","00:59:21,951",I care not for your poetry
871,"00:59:21,976","00:59:23,853",I only want your hand to hold
872,"00:59:24,020","00:59:26,105",I only want you near me
873,"00:59:26,272","00:59:27,774","To love
and kiss, to sweetly hold"
874,"00:59:27,941","00:59:30,318",For the dancing and the dreaming
875,"00:59:30,485","00:59:32,503","Through all life's
sorrows and delights"
876,"00:59:32,528","00:59:34,197",I'll keep your love inside me
877,"00:59:34,364","00:59:35,724","I will swim and
sail on savage seas"
878,"00:59:35,865","00:59:37,867",With ne'er a fear of drowning
879,"00:59:38,034","00:59:39,994","And gladly ride
the waves of life"
880,"00:59:40,161","00:59:42,222",If you will marry me
881,"00:59:45,166","00:59:46,184",I'm still going
882,"00:59:46,209","00:59:47,418","Gobber!
I'm done."
883,"00:59:50,672","00:59:53,424","I thought I would have to die before
we could have that dance again."
884,"00:59:53,591","00:59:56,094",No need for drastic measures.
885,"00:59:56,886","00:59:58,513","For you, my dear..."
886,"00:59:59,514","01:00:01,057",anything.
887,"01:00:02,267","01:00:04,269","Will you come home, Val?"
888,"01:00:05,687","01:00:08,273",Will you be my wife once again?
889,"01:00:14,612","01:00:17,240","We can be a family!
What do you say?"
890,"01:00:21,202","01:00:22,787",Yes.
891,"01:00:24,706","01:00:26,874","Great!
I'll do the cooking."
892,"01:00:29,210","01:00:31,629","Thank Odin you
didn't listen to me, son."
893,"01:00:31,796","01:00:33,236","We never would
have found each other."
894,"01:00:35,633","01:00:37,135",Toothless?
895,"01:00:40,972","01:00:42,056",What's happening?
896,"01:01:02,744","01:01:04,120",No.
897,"01:01:04,620","01:01:05,621",Val?
898,"01:01:05,788","01:01:07,915","Val! It's all right,
it's all right."
899,"01:01:08,082","01:01:10,835","We're a team now.
What do you want to do?"
900,"01:01:11,002","01:01:12,754",We have to save the dragons.
901,"01:01:13,129","01:01:15,506","Aye. You got it!
Come on, son."
902,"01:01:38,446","01:01:41,449","Whatever comes,
keep hitting the mountain."
903,"01:01:42,116","01:01:44,619",We need to draw the alpha out.
904,"01:01:54,379","01:01:55,838",Ready the traps!
905,"01:02:11,479","01:02:12,688",Surprise!
906,"01:02:12,855","01:02:14,315",Yeah!
907,"01:02:14,482","01:02:15,666",What?
908,"01:02:15,691","01:02:16,984",Whoa!
909,"01:02:17,902","01:02:19,695",Whoo! Whoo-hoo!
910,"01:02:20,238","01:02:22,532","You really are
full of surprises!"
911,"01:02:22,907","01:02:23,908",Let's go!
912,"01:02:24,033","01:02:26,828","Dragon riders, coming through!"
913,"01:02:28,704","01:02:29,705",Fire!
914,"01:02:35,336","01:02:36,337",Yeah!
915,"01:02:41,717","01:02:43,511",Cut them down!
916,"01:02:44,887","01:02:46,222","Whoa, whoa, whoa!"
917,"01:02:46,514","01:02:49,392","Eret, son of Eret!"
918,"01:02:59,610","01:03:00,862","Up, girl!"
919,"01:03:01,195","01:03:03,406","Lean left, Eret!
That's it!"
920,"01:03:03,614","01:03:05,091",Look out!
921,"01:03:13,791","01:03:15,626","Yeah, baby!"
922,"01:03:19,088","01:03:20,756",Take them down!
923,"01:03:20,923","01:03:22,550",Heads up!
924,"01:03:30,057","01:03:31,726",Dragon master.
925,"01:03:32,477","01:03:34,228","Welcome aboard, dragon rider!"
926,"01:03:34,395","01:03:36,063","Thanks, I think."
927,"01:03:36,230","01:03:37,565",Where have you been?
928,"01:03:37,732","01:03:40,651","You know, catching up with Mom."
929,"01:03:52,413","01:03:53,915",That's your mother?
930,"01:03:54,081","01:03:56,792","Now you know where I
get my dramatic flair."
931,"01:04:01,797","01:04:05,426","The alpha!
Now we have a fight!"
932,"01:04:19,190","01:04:20,650","Come on, Toothless!"
933,"01:04:20,816","01:04:23,027","Show them what you got, bud."
934,"01:04:27,490","01:04:28,491",That a boy!
935,"01:04:41,837","01:04:44,131","I've waited
a long time for this!"
936,"01:04:44,298","01:04:46,342",You cannot take our dragons!
937,"01:04:46,717","01:04:48,302","They are controlled
by the alpha!"
938,"01:04:48,469","01:04:51,364","Then it's a good thing
I brought a challenger."
939,"01:05:14,495","01:05:15,705",Another one?
940,"01:05:16,163","01:05:19,083","That is a class ten!
Class ten!"
941,"01:05:22,920","01:05:23,980",No.
942,"01:05:24,005","01:05:25,982","Come on!
Take down the alpha!"
943,"01:05:45,610","01:05:46,669",Thank you.
944,"01:05:46,694","01:05:47,945","For you, my dear..."
945,"01:05:48,279","01:05:49,739",anything.
946,"01:05:57,413","01:05:59,206","Val, do you think
you can stop them?"
947,"01:05:59,373","01:06:00,541",I'll do my best.
948,"01:06:00,708","01:06:01,917","Come on, Cloudjumper!"
949,"01:06:02,376","01:06:03,377",You!
950,"01:06:03,961","01:06:05,963",I watched you burn!
951,"01:06:06,130","01:06:08,591","It takes more than a
little fire to kill me!"
952,"01:06:31,238","01:06:32,490",Stoick!
953,"01:06:53,094","01:06:54,095",No!
954,"01:06:57,014","01:06:58,182",No!
955,"01:07:19,453","01:07:20,705",We have won.
956,"01:07:20,871","01:07:23,624","Now, finish her!"
957,"01:07:23,791","01:07:25,142",No!
958,"01:07:33,467","01:07:34,677",Hold on!
959,"01:07:34,844","01:07:35,845","Skullcrusher, go!"
960,"01:07:37,054","01:07:38,114","Come on, Gobber!"
961,"01:07:38,139","01:07:40,307","Right behind you, Stoick!"
962,"01:07:43,018","01:07:44,687",Whoa! Whoa!
963,"01:07:59,660","01:08:00,703",Stop!
964,"01:08:02,830","01:08:04,165",Stop!
965,"01:08:10,337","01:08:14,258",This is the great dragon master?
966,"01:08:14,425","01:08:17,094",The son of Stoick the Vast?
967,"01:08:18,888","01:08:21,766",What shame he must feel.
968,"01:08:23,017","01:08:26,395","All of this loss, and for what?"
969,"01:08:26,562","01:08:28,105",To become unstoppable?
970,"01:08:28,439","01:08:30,357",To rule the world?
971,"01:08:30,566","01:08:34,111","Dragons are kind,
amazing creatures..."
972,"01:08:34,278","01:08:36,113",that can bring people together.
973,"01:08:38,073","01:08:40,367",Or tear them apart.
974,"01:08:42,870","01:08:43,929",You see...
975,"01:08:43,954","01:08:47,917","I know what it is
to live in fear."
976,"01:08:48,083","01:08:50,753",To see my village burned...
977,"01:08:50,920","01:08:53,297",my family taken.
978,"01:08:54,131","01:08:56,550",But even as a boy...
979,"01:08:57,051","01:08:58,761",left with nothing...
980,"01:08:59,386","01:09:03,724","I vowed to rise above
the fear of dragons..."
981,"01:09:05,601","01:09:08,270","and liberate
the people of this world."
982,"01:09:08,437","01:09:10,564",Then why a dragon army?
983,"01:09:10,731","01:09:15,069","Well, you need dragons
to conquer other dragons."
984,"01:09:15,236","01:09:18,781","Or maybe you need dragons
to conquer people."
985,"01:09:18,948","01:09:21,742","To control those
who follow you..."
986,"01:09:22,159","01:09:23,911","and to get rid of
those who won't."
987,"01:09:26,914","01:09:28,624",Clever boy.
988,"01:09:28,791","01:09:31,418",The world wants peace.
989,"01:09:31,585","01:09:34,755","And we have the answer
back on Berk."
990,"01:09:34,922","01:09:36,507",Just let me show you.
991,"01:09:37,007","01:09:38,509",No!
992,"01:09:38,676","01:09:42,096",Let me show you!
993,"01:09:49,937","01:09:51,063",What in...
994,"01:09:56,944","01:09:58,112",Hiccup!
995,"01:09:59,029","01:10:00,389","Come on, Gobber!"
996,"01:10:00,990","01:10:03,117","Okay, change of plan!"
997,"01:10:05,202","01:10:08,664","No dragon can resist
the alpha's command."
998,"01:10:08,831","01:10:12,835","So, he who controls the alpha..."
999,"01:10:13,002","01:10:15,546",controls them all.
1000,"01:10:19,508","01:10:20,634",Toothless?
1001,"01:10:26,348","01:10:28,642","Toothless, you okay, bud?
What's going on?"
1002,"01:10:28,809","01:10:30,644",Witness true strength.
1003,"01:10:32,813","01:10:35,900","The strength of
will over others."
1004,"01:10:41,196","01:10:42,323",In the face of it...
1005,"01:10:43,157","01:10:45,743",you are nothing.
1006,"01:10:51,165","01:10:52,583",What did he just tell you?
1007,"01:10:56,378","01:10:58,005","Toothless, come on."
1008,"01:10:58,672","01:10:59,752",What's the matter with you?
1009,"01:11:00,049","01:11:01,175","No, no, no, no.
Come on."
1010,"01:11:01,342","01:11:02,927","What are you doing?
Knock it off."
1011,"01:11:03,510","01:11:05,387",Stop! Snap out of it!
1012,"01:11:12,853","01:11:13,854","Toothless, no!"
1013,"01:11:14,438","01:11:15,522",Toothless!
1014,"01:11:19,526","01:11:21,070","Don't!
Hiccup!"
1015,"01:11:22,529","01:11:23,572",Stop!
1016,"01:11:23,739","01:11:25,699","Son!
Dad!"
1017,"01:11:25,866","01:11:26,909",No!
1018,"01:11:46,220","01:11:47,262",No.
1019,"01:11:55,562","01:11:56,772",Dad!
1020,"01:11:57,731","01:11:58,774",Stoick!
1021,"01:12:02,403","01:12:03,404",Dad.
1022,"01:12:03,904","01:12:05,906","No, you..."
1023,"01:12:18,669","01:12:19,670",No.
1024,"01:12:28,971","01:12:31,181","No, no, no."
1025,"01:12:53,203","01:12:54,455",No! Get away from him!
1026,"01:12:56,331","01:12:57,833",Go on! Get out of here!
1027,"01:12:58,500","01:13:00,252",Get away!
1028,"01:13:02,004","01:13:05,632","It's not his fault.
You know that."
1029,"01:13:12,014","01:13:13,323",Good dragons...
1030,"01:13:13,348","01:13:15,476","under the control
of bad people..."
1031,"01:13:15,642","01:13:16,785",Wait! Don't go.
1032,"01:13:16,810","01:13:18,312",...do bad things.
1033,"01:13:38,499","01:13:39,500",Come on!
1034,"01:13:41,001","01:13:43,087","Gather the men
and meet me at Berk!"
1035,"01:13:43,253","01:13:44,713",Toothless!
1036,"01:13:44,880","01:13:46,673","No, don't."
1037,"01:14:12,366","01:14:14,785",May the Valkyries welcome you...
1038,"01:14:14,952","01:14:18,539","and lead you through
Odin's great battlefield."
1039,"01:14:18,705","01:14:22,042","May they sing your name
with love and fury..."
1040,"01:14:22,209","01:14:25,254","so that we might hear it rise
from the depths of Valhalla..."
1041,"01:14:25,420","01:14:28,215","and know that you have taken
your rightful place..."
1042,"01:14:28,382","01:14:30,425",at the table of kings.
1043,"01:14:32,052","01:14:34,555",For a great man has fallen.
1044,"01:14:35,806","01:14:38,976","A warrior.
A Chieftain."
1045,"01:14:39,143","01:14:40,727",A father.
1046,"01:14:41,895","01:14:43,397",A friend.
1047,"01:15:17,764","01:15:19,600","I'm sorry, Dad."
1048,"01:15:32,613","01:15:36,325","I'm not the chief
that you wanted me to be."
1049,"01:15:36,491","01:15:40,287","And I'm not the peacekeeper
I thought I was."
1050,"01:15:41,955","01:15:44,666",I don't know...
1051,"01:15:57,721","01:16:00,307",You came early into this world.
1052,"01:16:00,474","01:16:03,143",You were such a wee thing.
1053,"01:16:03,310","01:16:06,313","So frail, so fragile."
1054,"01:16:06,480","01:16:09,316",I feared you wouldn't make it.
1055,"01:16:11,026","01:16:13,153",But your father...
1056,"01:16:13,820","01:16:15,364",he never doubted.
1057,"01:16:16,657","01:16:17,966",He always said
1058,"01:16:17,991","01:16:20,661","you would become
the strongest of them all."
1059,"01:16:21,328","01:16:23,247",And he was right.
1060,"01:16:24,665","01:16:29,544","You have the heart of a chief
and a soul of a dragon."
1061,"01:16:29,711","01:16:31,480",Only you can bring
1062,"01:16:31,505","01:16:33,382",our worlds together.
1063,"01:16:34,383","01:16:38,387","That is who you are, son."
1064,"01:16:52,025","01:16:53,235",I...
1065,"01:16:54,361","01:16:57,906","I was so afraid
of becoming my dad."
1066,"01:16:59,449","01:17:02,411","Mostly because I
thought I never could."
1067,"01:17:02,577","01:17:06,290","How do you become
someone that great?"
1068,"01:17:06,456","01:17:10,752","That brave?
That selfless?"
1069,"01:17:13,922","01:17:17,259",I guess you can only try.
1070,"01:17:24,057","01:17:27,060",A chief protects his own.
1071,"01:17:30,314","01:17:32,065",We are going back.
1072,"01:17:33,233","01:17:34,985",With what?
1073,"01:17:35,152","01:17:37,112",He took all the dragons.
1074,"01:17:37,487","01:17:39,614",Not all of them.
1075,"01:17:50,334","01:17:52,169",I don't want to die!
1076,"01:17:52,336","01:17:53,628",We can't fly these things!
1077,"01:17:53,795","01:17:55,130","Yeah, no kidding!"
1078,"01:17:55,297","01:17:56,898",Whoa!
1079,"01:17:58,925","01:18:00,736","But won't that
Bewilderbeast just"
1080,"01:18:00,761","01:18:02,804","take control of these guys, too?"
1081,"01:18:02,971","01:18:05,766","They're babies.
They don't listen to anyone."
1082,"01:18:05,932","01:18:07,934",Yeah! Just like us!
1083,"01:18:08,101","01:18:11,146",This is very dangerous!
1084,"01:18:15,025","01:18:19,029","Some might suggest
this is poorly conceived."
1085,"01:18:19,279","01:18:21,281","It's a good thing
that I never listen."
1086,"01:18:22,824","01:18:26,453",So what is your plan?
1087,"01:18:26,620","01:18:29,790","Get Toothless back
and kick Drago's..."
1088,"01:18:29,956","01:18:31,041",Heads up!
1089,"01:18:31,833","01:18:33,185",And that thing.
1090,"01:18:33,210","01:18:34,669",Whoa...
1091,"01:18:56,858","01:18:58,460",That's a good boy.
1092,"01:19:04,699","01:19:06,368",Watch the furniture!
1093,"01:19:07,494","01:19:09,162",Where are you going?
1094,"01:19:25,846","01:19:28,849",Your chief is dead.
1095,"01:19:29,349","01:19:30,559",Stoick?
1096,"01:19:31,518","01:19:34,020",No one can protect you now.
1097,"01:19:49,244","01:19:50,287",No.
1098,"01:19:51,079","01:19:52,956",He took all the dragons!
1099,"01:19:54,791","01:19:58,770","Distract the alpha. Try to
keep his focus off Toothless."
1100,"01:19:58,795","01:20:00,046",How?
1101,"01:20:00,213","01:20:02,048","Have you forgotten
who you're riding with?"
1102,"01:20:02,215","01:20:05,552","There isn't a dragon alive
that I can't wrangle!"
1103,"01:20:05,719","01:20:06,862",Except for this one!
1104,"01:20:06,887","01:20:08,054",Amateur.
1105,"01:20:09,723","01:20:11,057","Hey, look.
It's Hiccup!"
1106,"01:20:17,772","01:20:18,773",What?
1107,"01:20:33,163","01:20:34,748",Keep them coming!
1108,"01:20:34,915","01:20:36,458","Black sheep, baby!"
1109,"01:20:47,594","01:20:48,637",Ten points!
1110,"01:21:03,026","01:21:04,486",I'm okay!
1111,"01:21:12,285","01:21:15,580","You certainly are hard to
get rid of, I'll say that."
1112,"01:21:15,747","01:21:17,040",Toothless?
1113,"01:21:18,375","01:21:19,709",Hey...
1114,"01:21:19,876","01:21:21,545","it's me, bud."
1115,"01:21:22,128","01:21:23,129",It's me.
1116,"01:21:23,380","01:21:25,298","It's me.
I'm right here, bud."
1117,"01:21:26,049","01:21:27,609",Come back to me.
1118,"01:21:29,427","01:21:32,097",He's not yours anymore.
1119,"01:21:32,264","01:21:34,099",He belongs to the alpha.
1120,"01:21:34,266","01:21:37,727","But, please,
great dragon master..."
1121,"01:21:37,894","01:21:40,230",try to take him.
1122,"01:21:40,397","01:21:43,817",He will not miss a second time.
1123,"01:21:44,234","01:21:45,986","It wasn't your fault, bud."
1124,"01:21:47,571","01:21:49,948",They made you do it.
1125,"01:21:59,457","01:22:01,793",You would never hurt him.
1126,"01:22:06,089","01:22:08,633",You would never hurt me.
1127,"01:22:11,845","01:22:13,847",How are you doing that?
1128,"01:22:14,014","01:22:15,031",Please.
1129,"01:22:15,056","01:22:17,183","You are my best friend, bud."
1130,"01:22:21,438","01:22:23,273",My best friend.
1131,"01:22:28,862","01:22:30,530",Atta boy! That's it!
1132,"01:22:30,989","01:22:32,007",I'm here!
1133,"01:22:32,032","01:22:33,199",Enough!
1134,"01:22:39,998","01:22:41,207",Hang on!
1135,"01:22:45,879","01:22:47,047","Almost there, buddy."
1136,"01:22:57,641","01:22:59,142",Do something!
1137,"01:22:59,309","01:23:01,186",We need to get those two apart.
1138,"01:23:12,072","01:23:14,240","We have to block
him out, Toothless."
1139,"01:23:14,407","01:23:16,409","Do you trust me, bud?"
1140,"01:23:18,370","01:23:20,163",We can do this.
1141,"01:23:20,747","01:23:22,749",You and me.
1142,"01:23:22,916","01:23:24,084",As one.
1143,"01:23:26,836","01:23:27,896",That's it.
1144,"01:23:27,921","01:23:30,423","Now let's try
this one more time!"
1145,"01:23:32,425","01:23:34,219","Take him down, babe!"
1146,"01:23:37,889","01:23:39,015",Go get them!
1147,"01:23:41,434","01:23:42,727",Take control of it!
1148,"01:23:45,355","01:23:46,523","Shut it out, Toothless."
1149,"01:23:46,690","01:23:48,274","Stop them!
Now!"
1150,"01:24:11,589","01:24:12,632",Not again.
1151,"01:24:14,884","01:24:16,970","Toothless!
It's now or never!"
1152,"01:24:20,265","01:24:21,599","Come on, bud!"
1153,"01:24:23,476","01:24:24,602",Hold on!
1154,"01:24:27,731","01:24:29,482",Yeah! We did it!
1155,"01:24:38,658","01:24:40,785","Hold him there, Toothless."
1156,"01:24:41,077","01:24:42,954",It's all over now.
1157,"01:24:44,748","01:24:46,166",Or is it?
1158,"01:24:49,502","01:24:50,603",No!
1159,"01:24:59,345","01:25:00,346",No!
1160,"01:25:02,432","01:25:03,433",No!
1161,"01:25:11,608","01:25:12,917",Hiccup!
1162,"01:25:43,848","01:25:45,225",He's challenging the alpha!
1163,"01:25:45,391","01:25:47,018",To protect you.
1164,"01:26:12,752","01:26:14,754","No, no, no! No!"
1165,"01:26:15,880","01:26:17,715",Fight back! Fight!
1166,"01:26:17,882","01:26:19,259",Fight!
1167,"01:26:21,594","01:26:24,013",What's the matter with you?
1168,"01:26:34,107","01:26:35,441",Now do you get it?
1169,"01:26:35,608","01:26:39,003","This is what it is to
earn a dragon's loyalty."
1170,"01:26:40,947","01:26:42,740",Let this end. Now.
1171,"01:26:43,283","01:26:44,450",Never!
1172,"01:26:44,617","01:26:45,618",Come on!
1173,"01:27:08,474","01:27:09,976",Fight!
1174,"01:27:43,509","01:27:46,070",The alpha protects them all.
1175,"01:28:45,738","01:28:48,366","You never cease
to amaze me, bud."
1176,"01:28:49,325","01:28:50,827",Thank you.
1177,"01:28:53,538","01:28:56,207","Toothless, you know
that doesn't wash out!"
1178,"01:28:58,710","01:29:00,837",I knew you'd come back!
1179,"01:29:03,506","01:29:04,549",Stormfly!
1180,"01:29:07,552","01:29:09,929","Give me a cuddle, Grumpy!"
1181,"01:29:13,725","01:29:15,268",Who's my little princess?
1182,"01:29:15,601","01:29:17,186","Don't you ever
leave again, Hookfang."
1183,"01:29:17,353","01:29:19,772","You are! Yes, you are!
I missed you!"
1184,"01:29:20,106","01:29:21,107",Barf!
1185,"01:29:21,274","01:29:22,942",Not you!
1186,"01:29:25,278","01:29:28,614","That was some pretty fine
dragon wrangling back there."
1187,"01:29:28,781","01:29:30,508",You'd make a good trapper.
1188,"01:29:30,533","01:29:32,010",Whoa!
1189,"01:29:32,035","01:29:35,221","You know, Skullcrusher's
gonna need somebody"
1190,"01:29:35,246","01:29:36,372",to look after him now.
1191,"01:29:37,123","01:29:38,124",Me?
1192,"01:29:42,378","01:29:43,588",I'd be honored.
1193,"01:29:45,798","01:29:49,761","Your father would be
every bit as proud as I am."
1194,"01:29:49,927","01:29:51,387",Thank you.
1195,"01:29:51,554","01:29:53,431","I'm really glad
you're here, Mom."
1196,"01:29:53,598","01:29:55,641",And here I'll stay.
1197,"01:29:57,143","01:29:58,478",See?
1198,"01:29:58,644","01:30:00,271",I told you it was in here.
1199,"01:30:02,482","01:30:05,485","Still doing that one?
That's hilarious."
1200,"01:30:05,651","01:30:07,170","Come here, you."
1201,"01:30:08,362","01:30:09,363",Ooh!
1202,"01:30:39,811","01:30:42,080",The chief has come home!
1203,"01:30:48,694","01:30:51,005",Long live the chief!
1204,"01:30:51,030","01:30:55,201","Long live the chief!
Long live the chief!"
1205,"01:31:08,047","01:31:09,465",Yeah!
1206,"01:31:20,059","01:31:22,061",This is Berk.
1207,"01:31:22,895","01:31:25,231","A bit trampled and busted
and covered in ice..."
1208,"01:31:25,398","01:31:27,150",but it's home.
1209,"01:31:27,316","01:31:28,901",It's our home.
1210,"01:31:33,072","01:31:35,908","Those who attacked us
are relentless and crazy."
1211,"01:31:36,993","01:31:38,886",But those who stopped them...
1212,"01:31:38,911","01:31:41,289",even more so!
1213,"01:31:43,916","01:31:45,918",We may be small in numbers...
1214,"01:31:46,085","01:31:47,420",but we stand for something...
1215,"01:31:47,587","01:31:50,840","bigger than anything
the world can pit against us."
1216,"01:31:51,841","01:31:54,010",We are the voice of peace.
1217,"01:31:54,218","01:31:57,263","And, bit by bit,
we will change this world."
1218,"01:32:06,439","01:32:08,941","You see, we have
something they don't."
1219,"01:32:09,233","01:32:10,568","Sure, they have armies..."
1220,"01:32:11,277","01:32:13,738",and they have armadas...
1221,"01:32:14,363","01:32:16,199",but we have...
1222,"01:32:17,742","01:32:19,594",our dragons!
1223,"01:32:22,496","01:32:24,182",Let the wind carry us
1224,"01:32:24,207","01:32:26,959","To the clouds,
hurry up, all right"
1225,"01:32:29,337","01:32:31,063",We can travel so far
1226,"01:32:31,088","01:32:34,383",As our eyes can see
1227,"01:32:36,177","01:32:42,141",We go where no one goes
1228,"01:32:43,017","01:32:46,954",We slow for no one
1229,"01:32:46,979","01:32:48,789",Get out...
1230,"01:32:48,814","01:32:51,567",...of our way
1231,"01:33:15,841","01:33:17,568",Awake in the sky
1232,"01:33:17,593","01:33:20,346","We break up so high, all right"
1233,"01:33:22,723","01:33:24,450",Let's make it our own
1234,"01:33:24,475","01:33:27,311",Let's savor it
1235,"01:33:29,355","01:33:34,502",We go where no one goes
1236,"01:33:34,527","01:33:38,406",We slow for no one
1237,"01:33:40,116","01:33:44,120",Get out of our way
1238,"01:34:03,597","01:34:08,728",We slow for no one
1239,"01:34:10,146","01:34:15,860",We go where no one goes
1240,"01:34:17,028","01:34:22,033",We slow for no one
1241,"01:34:23,826","01:34:30,725",We go where no one goes
1242,"01:34:30,750","01:34:37,590",We go where no one goes
