573,"00:33:00,958","00:33:03,667",Having all those brains squished in there?

614,"00:35:14,875","00:35:17,708","But that's not right!
He didn't do anything."
615,"00:35:17,792","00:35:20,167",Take it from me. The boy's doomed.
616,"00:35:20,250","00:35:22,375","Matilda, please help me."
617,"00:35:22,458","00:35:24,000",Why not just tell her that…
618,"00:35:24,917","00:35:25,833",Okay.
619,"00:35:26,750","00:35:28,167","Look, when did this happen?"
620,"00:35:28,750","00:35:30,167",About 20 minutes ago.
621,"00:35:30,250","00:35:31,417",But why?
622,"00:35:33,375","00:35:35,625","You'd better hide. Quick, blazers!"
623,"00:35:35,708","00:35:38,417",Please don't tell her where I am!
624,"00:35:40,125","00:35:41,958","Run, run!"
625,"00:35:42,042","00:35:42,917",Hurry up!
626,"00:35:51,958","00:35:54,375","Be still, child!"
627,"00:35:57,792","00:36:03,500","What a repellent parade
of imps and hobgoblins,"
628,"00:36:03,583","00:36:06,917",chitter-chattering away.
629,"00:36:08,333","00:36:12,292",Where's the maggot known as Nigel?
630,"00:36:15,750","00:36:17,417","Over there, under those blazers."
631,"00:36:24,375","00:36:26,375",Where he's been for the last hour!
632,"00:36:27,292","00:36:28,125",What?
633,"00:36:28,958","00:36:29,792",Yeah.
634,"00:36:29,875","00:36:34,375","You see, Nigel suffers from a rare
but chronic sleep disorder, narcolepsy."
635,"00:36:35,000","00:36:37,000","The condition is characterized
by the sufferer"
636,"00:36:37,083","00:36:39,167",experiencing bouts of fatigue
637,"00:36:39,250","00:36:41,792",and falling asleep without any warning.
638,"00:36:41,875","00:36:44,583","He fell asleep and we put him
in the blazers for safety."
639,"00:36:45,667","00:36:46,542",Didn't we?
640,"00:36:48,667","00:36:49,792",Didn't we?
641,"00:36:53,625","00:36:56,125","I had the strangest dream, Mum."
642,"00:36:56,708","00:36:57,917",I thought I was…
643,"00:36:58,958","00:37:00,417",Oh.
644,"00:37:00,500","00:37:02,042","Hello, Miss Trunchbull."
645,"00:37:08,583","00:37:10,208",Amanda Thripp.
646,"00:37:13,458","00:37:16,917","Y... y... yes, Miss Trunchbull?"
647,"00:37:17,500","00:37:23,292",What have I said about… pigtails?
648,"00:37:23,875","00:37:26,375",I hate pigtails.
649,"00:37:26,458","00:37:28,958","But my mummy likes them.
She says they make me look pretty."
650,"00:37:29,042","00:37:31,417","Well, your mother is a twit!"
651,"00:37:31,500","00:37:33,250",And here she goes!
652,"00:37:33,333","00:37:36,375",Look at that spin!
653,"00:37:36,458","00:37:37,958","Oh, my word!"
654,"00:37:39,375","00:37:41,708",That's far! That's very…
655,"00:37:43,042","00:37:44,292",…and we're there!
656,"00:37:44,875","00:37:46,583",Yes! Still got it.
657,"00:37:47,333","00:37:50,583","Check and see if that child
is still alive, will you?"
658,"00:37:55,708","00:37:57,500",And what is your name?
659,"00:37:57,583","00:37:58,417",Matilda.
660,"00:37:59,208","00:38:00,292",Matilda Wormwood.
661,"00:38:00,375","00:38:04,458","Oh! You're Wormwood, are you?"
662,"00:38:05,667","00:38:08,583","I like troublemakers, Wormwood."
663,"00:38:09,458","00:38:11,542",They make such a lovely sound…
664,"00:38:12,125","00:38:14,375",when they snap.
665,"00:38:15,083","00:38:16,500",She's alive!
666,"00:38:17,125","00:38:19,250","- Hip, hip!
- Hooray!"
667,"00:38:19,333","00:38:21,333","- Hip, hip!
- Hooray!"
668,"00:38:21,417","00:38:23,792","- Hip, hip!
- Hooray!"
669,"00:38:26,875","00:38:29,958","Remember, Wormwood,
you can never win."
670,"00:38:30,042","00:38:34,375","I promise you that.
And a promise is a promise is a promise."
671,"00:38:37,292","00:38:39,833",And so the great day arrived.
672,"00:38:39,917","00:38:43,375",The Burning Woman Hurling Through the Air

676,"00:38:53,333","00:38:57,708","It was like the entire world
had gathered to see the acrobat"
677,"00:38:57,792","00:39:02,667","and the escapologist's incredible
death-defying feat."
678,"00:39:36,333","00:39:38,625",Everything was arranged by…
679,"00:39:39,708","00:39:42,167",the acrobat's evil stepsister.
680,"00:39:42,750","00:39:46,333","A frightening woman who used to be
an Olympic class hammer thrower."
681,"00:39:46,917","00:39:50,125","People whispered that in her dark
and brooding heart,"
682,"00:39:50,208","00:39:53,833","she resented her stepsister's
success and love."
683,"00:39:56,708","00:39:58,042",Suddenly…
684,"00:39:58,958","00:40:00,833","out came the escapologist,"
685,"00:40:00,917","00:40:03,208","but there was no sign of the acrobat,"
686,"00:40:03,292","00:40:06,917","and no glimpse at all
of the shiny white scarf she always wore."
687,"00:40:08,208","00:40:10,125","Ladies and gentlemen,"
688,"00:40:10,708","00:40:12,500","boys and girls,"
689,"00:40:12,583","00:40:16,167",The Burning Woman Hurling Through the Air

694,"00:40:29,750","00:40:33,083",Canceled because my wife is…
695,"00:40:33,833","00:40:34,958",pregnant!
696,"00:40:35,542","00:40:37,542","Oh, Matilda."
697,"00:40:39,167","00:40:42,292",Absolute… silence.
698,"00:40:44,583","00:40:47,250",You could have heard a fly burp.
699,"00:40:49,833","00:40:51,708","- Then suddenly, the audience…
- Hip, hip!"
700,"00:40:51,792","00:40:55,042","…jumped to its feet
and roared in appreciation!"
701,"00:41:00,583","00:41:03,125",The great feat was instantly forgotten.
702,"00:41:04,000","00:41:06,500",And the applause went on for over an hour!
703,"00:41:09,917","00:41:12,625","Oh, Matilda, that's wonderful!"
704,"00:41:12,708","00:41:14,833",I love stories that end happily.
705,"00:41:15,917","00:41:20,708","Forgotten by everyone
except the acrobat's evil stepsister."
706,"00:41:22,083","00:41:26,500","When all had quietened down
she produced a contract!"
707,"00:41:26,583","00:41:28,375",A contract?
708,"00:41:28,458","00:41:31,583","A contract you have signed
to perform this feat."
709,"00:41:31,667","00:41:34,583","- And perform this feat, you shall!
- No."
710,"00:41:34,667","00:41:37,792","I've paid for the posters, publicity,"
711,"00:41:37,875","00:41:40,292","the catering, the toilet facilities."
712,"00:41:40,375","00:41:42,292","If I give the crowd their money back,"
713,"00:41:42,375","00:41:43,875",where is my profit?
714,"00:41:44,458","00:41:47,333",A contract is a contract is a contract.
715,"00:41:47,417","00:41:49,000",My hands are tied.

720,"00:42:00,375","00:42:03,000",and it will be performed this day!
721,"00:42:03,083","00:42:05,667",Or off to prison you both shall go!
722,"00:42:10,042","00:42:11,958",What… what happened next?
723,"00:42:13,667","00:42:14,833",I dunno.
724,"00:42:14,917","00:42:16,875",What? How can you not know?
725,"00:42:17,583","00:42:20,667",It just comes to me in… fizzes.
726,"00:42:20,750","00:42:23,917","Well, could you fizz up
a little bit more for me? Now."
727,"00:42:24,500","00:42:26,250",I don't think it works like that.
728,"00:42:26,833","00:42:28,000",Of course it doesn't.
729,"00:42:28,625","00:42:32,250","- Where is this coming from, Matilda?
- What do you mean?"
730,"00:42:32,333","00:42:33,958","I mean, it's incredible."
731,"00:42:34,042","00:42:37,000",But it's taking rather a dark turn.
732,"00:42:37,083","00:42:38,750",Maybe I shouldn't tell you any more.
733,"00:42:38,833","00:42:41,292","No, no, no. No."
734,"00:42:41,375","00:42:43,417",We must find out how it ends.
735,"00:42:44,458","00:42:46,667","All I'm saying is,
is everything all right?"
736,"00:42:46,750","00:42:47,667",You could tell me.
737,"00:42:47,750","00:42:51,208","I'd better go, Mrs. Phelps, Mum's waiting."
738,"00:42:51,292","00:42:53,833",She gets so upset when she's away from me.
739,"00:42:53,917","00:42:57,375","She says every minute
is like an eternity so…"
740,"00:42:58,167","00:43:00,667",Is she coming here? Can I meet her?
741,"00:43:00,750","00:43:02,208","Bye, Mrs. Phelps!"
742,"00:43:02,292","00:43:04,583","Matilda, tomorrow I'm at the windmill."
743,"00:43:04,667","00:43:06,417","Okay, I'll find you."
744,"00:43:12,625","00:43:14,042",I've got it.

747,"00:43:22,375","00:43:24,458","- You're hurting me!
- Yeah. Hold on, hold on."
748,"00:43:28,417","00:43:30,250","Let me pull, Harry."
749,"00:43:30,333","00:43:31,333",Pull then!
750,"00:44:01,625","00:44:02,458",Matilda.
751,"00:44:05,958","00:44:08,333",I believe your mind is extraordinary.
752,"00:44:08,875","00:44:11,500",So I'm taking things into my own hands.

754,"00:44:14,000","00:44:16,500","I'm going to bring in a selection

while I teach the others,"
756,"00:44:19,167","00:44:21,958","and if you have any questions, well…"
757,"00:44:22,042","00:44:23,750",I shall do my best to answer them.
758,"00:44:25,042","00:44:26,250",How does that sound?
759,"00:44:33,542","00:44:34,708",Matilda…
760,"00:44:36,167","00:44:37,792",That is the biggest hug in the world.
761,"00:44:39,125","00:44:41,333",You're going to hug all the air out of me.
762,"00:44:43,792","00:44:45,833",What a touching little scene.
763,"00:44:50,167","00:44:51,042",Move!
764,"00:44:51,750","00:44:56,833","I believe I said this maggot
was to receive no special treatment."
765,"00:44:56,917","00:45:00,167","In fact, I seem to recall informing you"
766,"00:45:00,250","00:45:05,917","that this particular snot-ball
was evil incarnate, did I not?"
767,"00:45:06,000","00:45:07,625","No, Miss Trunchbull, Matilda is not..."
768,"00:45:07,708","00:45:09,417","Did you just say ""no,"" Jenny?"
769,"00:45:11,000","00:45:11,833",To me?
770,"00:45:14,792","00:45:18,167",Matilda Wormwood is a criminal.
771,"00:45:19,875","00:45:21,042","This morning,"
772,"00:45:21,125","00:45:25,417","a piece of my private
chocolate cake was stolen."
773,"00:45:27,667","00:45:31,292","It is my contention that you performed
this vileness, Wormwood, you."
774,"00:45:31,375","00:45:33,917","You have two choices,
admit your guilt and be punished,"
775,"00:45:34,000","00:45:36,625",or call me a liar… and be punished.
776,"00:45:39,917","00:45:41,667",Think very carefully
777,"00:45:41,750","00:45:45,083","about what comes out
of your mouth, Wormwood."
778,"00:45:45,667","00:45:47,458",I did not stea...
779,"00:46:21,875","00:46:23,250",Chocolate.
780,"00:46:23,958","00:46:26,292",Bruce Bogtrotter.
781,"00:46:28,458","00:46:30,625","Yes, Miss Trunchbull?"
782,"00:46:32,083","00:46:34,417","Thank you, Maurice, that will be all."
783,"00:46:37,708","00:46:41,958","Staff dismissed. Come on.
Everybody out. Everybody out, come on."
784,"00:46:42,042","00:46:42,958",Move!
785,"00:46:55,125","00:46:56,750",You liked my cake…
786,"00:46:57,708","00:46:58,833","didn't you, Bruce?"
787,"00:46:58,917","00:47:02,000","Yes, Miss Trunchbull,
it was very delicious."
788,"00:47:02,083","00:47:03,542",So chocolatey.
789,"00:47:04,125","00:47:06,000","And I'm really very sorry, I..."
790,"00:47:06,083","00:47:06,917","No, no…"
791,"00:47:07,792","00:47:11,042","Just so long as you enjoyed the cake.
That's the main thing."
792,"00:47:12,333","00:47:13,167",Is it?
793,"00:47:14,708","00:47:16,250","Oh, Cook."
794,"00:47:38,292","00:47:39,125",Be still!
795,"00:47:42,208","00:47:44,500","What's the matter, Bogtrotter?
Lost your appetite?"
796,"00:47:45,042","00:47:48,750","Don't worry… all you have to do
is eat every last crumb."
797,"00:47:50,167","00:47:54,125","And if you perform this incredible feat,
I promise you,"
798,"00:47:54,208","00:47:56,042",all will be forgiven.
799,"00:47:56,125","00:47:58,042",Every crumb?
800,"00:47:59,167","00:48:01,333","- But I'm full.
- Oh, no, you're not full."
801,"00:48:01,417","00:48:04,792","I'll tell you when you're full.
And I say that criminals like you"
802,"00:48:04,875","00:48:07,375","aren't full until they've
eaten the entire cake."
803,"00:48:08,583","00:48:11,458","- But...
- You haven't got time for ""buts."" Eat."
804,"00:48:11,542","00:48:13,042",But I can't eat it all.
805,"00:48:13,125","00:48:14,667","Headmistress, he'll be sick."
806,"00:48:15,875","00:48:18,458","He should have thought of that
before he made a pact with Satan"
807,"00:48:18,542","00:48:20,375",and decided to steal my cake.
808,"00:48:20,875","00:48:22,708","- Eat.
- He can't!"
809,"00:48:22,792","00:48:24,500","- Eat.

936,"00:56:28,792","00:56:31,917",Mrs. Phelps! Where's the revenge section?
937,"00:56:32,000","00:56:36,250","Well, we don't have a revenge section.
Is it a bully?"
938,"00:56:36,833","00:56:40,042","'Cause you know the best way
to deal with bullies is tell someone."
939,"00:56:40,625","00:56:43,292",Straight away. They thrive on silence.
940,"00:56:43,875","00:56:47,250","Tell a teacher.
Or better still, the headmistress."
941,"00:56:48,208","00:56:50,792","I think I've got the next part
of the story."
942,"00:56:50,875","00:56:52,167","But I shall warn you,"
943,"00:56:53,292","00:56:54,667",it's about to get real.
944,"00:56:58,708","00:57:02,083","Slowly, the acrobat
tied her shiny white scarf"
945,"00:57:02,167","00:57:03,750",around her husband's wrist.
946,"00:57:04,500","00:57:06,125","For luck, my love."
947,"00:57:07,000","00:57:10,542","Then she hugged him
with the biggest hug in the world."
948,"00:57:10,625","00:57:14,792","So hard that he felt that
she could hug all the air out of him."
949,"00:57:17,333","00:57:19,542",And so they prepared themselves
950,"00:57:19,625","00:57:23,125","for the most dangerous feat
that had ever been performed."
951,"00:57:42,292","00:57:46,167","The great escapologist had to somehow
escape from the padlocks,"
952,"00:57:46,250","00:57:51,625","break free from the cage, and attempt
to rescue his wife within 12 seconds."
953,"00:57:51,708","00:57:54,458",Or she would be blown to bits!
954,"00:58:09,542","00:58:14,000","The moment the fuse was lit,
the acrobat swung into the air."
955,"00:58:14,083","00:58:16,292","One second, two seconds…"
956,"00:58:16,375","00:58:17,875",…the crowd held their breath
957,"00:58:17,958","00:58:22,958","as she swung higher and higher
above the sharks and spiky objects!"
958,"00:58:23,042","00:58:25,167","Three seconds, four seconds."
959,"00:58:25,250","00:58:27,667",The evil sister looked on gleefully.
960,"00:58:27,750","00:58:30,042","Five seconds, six seconds."
961,"00:58:30,125","00:58:32,250","The escapologist
couldn't take his eyes from his wife"
962,"00:58:32,333","00:58:34,458","as he struggled in his chains,"
963,"00:58:34,542","00:58:37,458","knowing that the tiniest, weeniest mistake"
964,"00:58:37,542","00:58:40,417","would mean that he'd lose her
and their child forever."
965,"00:58:41,042","00:58:43,125","Seven seconds, and suddenly…"
966,"00:58:43,208","00:58:45,458",She let go!
967,"00:58:49,250","00:58:52,292","The escapologist reached out
with one huge, massive arm"
968,"00:58:52,375","00:58:53,625",to catch his wife and the child.
969,"00:58:55,500","00:58:57,333","- Eight seconds!
- No, I can't look."
970,"00:58:57,417","00:59:00,542",Nine seconds! Ten seconds! And…
971,"00:59:01,208","00:59:04,583",And… And… Eleven seconds!
972,"00:59:04,667","00:59:09,333","He grabbed the dynamite
and flung it far, far away!"
973,"00:59:09,417","00:59:13,333","Hurray! So this story does
have a happy ending after all."
974,"00:59:14,167","00:59:15,000",No.
975,"00:59:16,667","00:59:17,583","No, it doesn't."
976,"00:59:30,875","00:59:34,042",No! Was she okay? Did she survive?
977,"00:59:34,625","00:59:37,292",She broke every bone in her body.
978,"00:59:37,958","00:59:40,167","Except the ones at the ends
of her little fingers."
979,"00:59:41,125","00:59:44,042","She did manage to live long enough
to have their child."
980,"00:59:47,958","00:59:49,625",But the effort was too great.
981,"00:59:51,208","00:59:52,833",Love our girl.
982,"00:59:54,500","00:59:58,042",Love our daughter with all your heart.
983,"00:59:59,667","01:00:02,458",She is all we ever wanted.
984,"01:00:12,708","01:00:13,875",And then she died.
985,"01:00:16,708","01:00:17,750",And then…
986,"01:00:18,750","01:00:20,125",things got worse.
987,"01:00:20,208","01:00:21,750",What? Worse?
988,"01:00:21,833","01:00:23,417",I'm afraid they did.
989,"01:00:23,500","01:00:25,875",Because the escapologist was so kind
990,"01:00:25,958","01:00:30,042","that he never for one second blamed
the evil stepsister for what happened."
991,"01:00:30,917","01:00:35,708","In fact, he asked her to move in
and help look after his daughter."
992,"01:00:35,792","01:00:38,167","No, no,
don't ask her to move in."
993,"01:00:38,250","01:00:40,500","She was nothing but cruel
to the little girl,"
994,"01:00:40,583","01:00:43,708","making her wash and clean
all day long. Shouting,"
995,"01:00:43,792","01:00:46,208","""Clean the floor and I'll be nice!"""
996,"01:00:46,292","01:00:49,458","When the little girl did clean it,
she was even crueler"
997,"01:00:49,542","01:00:52,417","because she was
a terrible, terrible cheat!"
998,"01:00:52,500","01:00:53,625",I hate cheats!
999,"01:00:53,708","01:00:57,667","All in secret, so the escapologist
never suspected a thing."
1000,"01:00:57,750","01:01:00,750","And so the poor little girl grew up
with the meanest, cruelest,"
1001,"01:01:00,833","01:01:03,875","horriblest aunt
you could possibly imagine!"
1002,"01:01:03,958","01:01:06,042",Let's call the police!
1003,"01:01:07,042","01:01:08,208",Mrs. Phelps.
1004,"01:01:09,125","01:01:10,667",It's just a story.
1005,"01:01:11,250","01:01:12,125",What?
1006,"01:01:14,333","01:01:16,708","Oh. Yes, of course."
1007,"01:01:17,375","01:01:18,375",A story.
1008,"01:01:19,167","01:01:21,500","It's just, you make it so real."
1009,"01:01:22,375","01:01:24,083","Your mind, Matilda."
1010,"01:01:24,583","01:01:28,042","Your parents must think they've won
the lottery with a child like you."
1011,"01:01:28,667","01:01:30,708",Oh… they do.
1012,"01:01:31,667","01:01:33,250",They're always saying that.
1013,"01:01:33,333","01:01:35,833","In fact, they say,"
1014,"01:01:35,917","01:01:39,500","""We're so proud of you, Matilda,
you're like winning the…"""
1015,"01:01:43,333","01:01:45,750",Yeah. I'd better go.
1016,"01:01:50,625","01:01:53,833",It's just like winning the lottery!
1017,"01:01:53,917","01:01:54,917",What?
1018,"01:01:55,542","01:01:56,708",Me?
1019,"01:01:56,792","01:01:59,250","You? No, you're like
eating someone else's bogeys."
1020,"01:01:59,333","01:02:01,583","Like winning a snottery, you, boy."
1021,"01:02:01,667","01:02:02,708",I'm a girl.
1022,"01:02:02,792","01:02:04,542","But how, Harry?"
1023,"01:02:04,625","01:02:06,208","Remember that big, muscly idiot?"
1024,"01:02:06,292","01:02:08,958","Turns out he had a whole lot
of muscly mates."
1025,"01:02:09,042","01:02:10,625",Bucketloads of cash.
1026,"01:02:10,708","01:02:13,042",Everyone wanting a luxury car.
1027,"01:02:13,125","01:02:17,292","All I had was a load of old bangers,
each with 100,000 miles on the clock."
1028,"01:02:17,375","01:02:20,375","So, I did what any decent
business leader would."
1029,"01:02:20,458","01:02:21,500",What?
1030,"01:02:21,583","01:02:22,875",I bought a drill.
1031,"01:02:22,958","01:02:26,875","Attached it to the speedometer
and whacked it in reverse."
1032,"01:02:26,958","01:02:29,417","I put back the mileage
on every one of those cars"
1033,"01:02:29,500","01:02:33,083","and sold them to those big,
muscly idiots, resulting in…"
1034,"01:02:33,167","01:02:34,875",Money!
1035,"01:02:34,958","01:02:36,083",But you cheated them!
1036,"01:02:37,417","01:02:38,333",Excuse me?
1037,"01:02:38,417","01:02:41,875","You cheated them.
What you did, it wasn't right."
1038,"01:02:41,958","01:02:43,417",You're just a cheat!
1039,"01:02:44,000","01:02:46,375","Oh, the little pig!"
1040,"01:02:47,500","01:02:50,875","It's the books, Harry.
It's the books and the stories."
1041,"01:02:50,958","01:02:52,250",Is it now?
1042,"01:02:53,125","01:02:53,958","Books, is it?"
1043,"01:02:56,750","01:02:58,500",You know what I'm going to do tomorrow?
1044,"01:02:59,000","01:03:00,583","I'm going to go down to that library,"
1045,"01:03:01,375","01:03:05,750","I'm going to tell that old bag
to never let you in again."
1046,"01:03:05,833","01:03:07,125",What?
1047,"01:03:07,208","01:03:10,000","Always sticking your nose in
where it don't belong."
1048,"01:03:10,750","01:03:14,875",You nasty little creep!
1049,"01:03:22,958","01:03:27,667","That night, the escapologist's daughter
cried herself to sleep."
1050,"01:03:27,750","01:03:31,458","She never said a word
about the evil step-aunt's bullying."
1051,"01:03:31,542","01:03:33,875","She didn't want to add
to her father's pain."
1052,"01:03:34,583","01:03:38,083","This only encouraged the woman
to greater cruelties,"
1053,"01:03:38,167","01:03:41,500",until one day she exploded.
1054,"01:03:42,250","01:03:45,042","Sticking your
nose in where it doesn't belong!"
1055,"01:03:45,125","01:03:47,458",You nasty little creep!
1056,"01:03:47,542","01:03:50,667","And she threw her…
threw her into a dank,"
1057,"01:03:50,750","01:03:54,292","dark, dusty cellar,
locked the door and went out."
1058,"01:03:57,417","01:04:01,083","But that night, the escapologist
happened to come home early."
1059,"01:04:02,667","01:04:05,542","And when he heard the sound
of his daughter's tears,"
1060,"01:04:05,625","01:04:08,000",he smashed the door open.

1294,"01:19:40,917","01:19:45,458",I've got a newt in my knickers!
1295,"01:19:45,542","01:19:48,792",Okay. That was odd.
1296,"01:19:51,000","01:19:52,958","Right. Everyone, back to class."
1297,"01:19:55,500","01:19:59,125","And please, please keep your heads down
for the rest of the day."
1298,"01:20:01,833","01:20:02,667",Matilda.
1299,"01:20:02,750","01:20:04,417",I need to show you something.
1300,"01:20:06,125","01:20:07,417","Watch, Miss Honey."
1301,"01:20:09,167","01:20:11,292","Matilda, if Miss Trunchbull sees..."
1302,"01:20:11,375","01:20:12,792",Just watch. Please.
1303,"01:20:19,792","01:20:21,750","- I-I think we should go, before...
- Wait."
1304,"01:20:59,708","01:21:01,708",I moved it with my eyes.
1305,"01:21:03,542","01:21:04,792",Am I strange?
1306,"01:21:08,708","01:21:11,500",How do you fancy a… nice cup of tea?
1307,"01:21:23,292","01:21:25,250","Oh, no, no, no.
Not that way. This way."
1308,"01:21:26,917","01:21:30,292","What do you think it is?
This thing with my eyes."
1309,"01:21:31,042","01:21:32,583","Well, what did it feel like?"
1310,"01:21:34,042","01:21:35,417",Felt like fizzing.
1311,"01:21:36,125","01:21:37,167",Fizzing.
1312,"01:21:38,125","01:21:40,208","But not bad fizzing, good fizzing."
1313,"01:21:41,125","01:21:42,208",Good fizzing.
1314,"01:21:43,083","01:21:45,125",Good fizzing. Hm…
1315,"01:21:45,792","01:21:47,958","Okay, let's see."
1316,"01:21:48,875","01:21:52,500","I'm no expert because I'm not sure
there are experts in fizzing,"
1317,"01:21:52,583","01:21:56,292","but I think it has something to do
with that incredible mind of yours."
1318,"01:21:57,458","01:22:00,292","You mean, there's no room in my head
for all my brains?"
1319,"01:22:00,375","01:22:02,625","So they have to squish out
through my eyes?"
1320,"01:22:03,375","01:22:06,583","Well, yes.
Yes, that's exactly what I mean."
1321,"01:22:09,250","01:22:10,375","Well, here we are."
1322,"01:22:11,083","01:22:12,125",Where are we?
1323,"01:22:19,917","01:22:21,000",Wow.
1324,"01:22:21,083","01:22:23,500",They pay teachers really badly.
1325,"01:22:24,875","01:22:28,542","Well, actually, yes, they do."
1326,"01:22:29,417","01:22:31,292",But I'm poorer even than most.
1327,"01:22:35,000","01:22:38,583","You see, my father died when I was young."
1328,"01:22:38,667","01:22:42,042",Magnus was his name. He was so kind.
1329,"01:22:42,750","01:22:46,125","But… when he was gone,"
1330,"01:22:46,208","01:22:48,708",my aunt became my legal guardian.
1331,"01:22:49,375","01:22:54,208","And she was cruel and mean
like you cannot even imagine."
1332,"01:22:54,792","01:22:58,375","Then when I became a teacher,
she presented me with a bill."
1333,"01:22:59,167","01:23:00,542",She'd written everything down.
1334,"01:23:00,625","01:23:04,958","Every teabag, every gas bill,
every tin of beans."
1335,"01:23:05,042","01:23:08,750","She made me sign a contract
to pay her back every single penny."
1336,"01:23:09,250","01:23:10,083",Really?
1337,"01:23:10,167","01:23:13,917","She even produced a document that said
that my father gave her his house."
1338,"01:23:14,875","01:23:17,750","But did he really do that, Magnus,"
1339,"01:23:17,833","01:23:19,875",did he just give her his house?
1340,"01:23:20,917","01:23:25,000","Well, I've always felt it was…
suspicious."
1341,"01:23:25,583","01:23:28,917","You see, she said his death
was an accident, but…"
1342,"01:23:30,583","01:23:32,125",You think she did him in!
1343,"01:23:33,875","01:23:36,875","Well, I cannot say for sure."
1344,"01:23:38,333","01:23:43,750","All I really know is that years of being
bullied by that woman made me, well…"
1345,"01:23:45,208","01:23:46,375",pathetic.
1346,"01:23:48,292","01:23:52,125","Then one day, I came across this old shed."
1347,"01:23:53,500","01:23:54,708",I fell in love with it.
1348,"01:23:56,167","01:23:59,292","I begged the farmer who owned it
to let me move in."
1349,"01:24:00,208","01:24:02,500","He thought I was mad, but…"
1350,"01:24:03,583","01:24:05,417","he said ""yes,"" and…"
1351,"01:24:07,458","01:24:09,167",And that's why you live here.

she's… my step-aunt."

1426,"01:30:09,083","01:30:11,667","And they gave me 24 hours
to get them the money back."
1427,"01:30:11,750","01:30:13,667",Only somebody already spent it.

Lavender, Nigel, Amanda?"
