2,"00:01:37,416","00:01:39,541","Almost there, just an easy little hawk."
3,"00:01:40,458","00:01:41,458",Kind of.
4,"00:01:46,416","00:01:48,375","Hey, you wanted to come this time."
5,"00:01:49,000","00:01:52,250",Just a little fire.
6,"00:01:57,000","00:01:58,750","Hey, hey, ow."
7,"00:02:30,000","00:02:31,000",You hear anything?
8,"00:02:31,166","00:02:32,791",I don't like it.
9,"00:02:33,333","00:02:36,625","There's gotta be other
people out here, other villages."
10,"00:02:37,833","00:02:41,250",And one day someone's gonna end certain.
11,"00:02:43,708","00:02:48,250",Never change.
12,"00:03:31,208","00:03:37,625","Hey, hey, sweet beautiful chicken."
13,"00:03:40,000","00:03:43,500",What are you waiting for?
14,"00:03:43,875","00:03:45,000",Let's go home.
15,"00:04:54,000","00:04:55,791",I can't wait till I retire.
16,"00:06:31,708","00:06:38,707",You're bruised.
17,"00:06:38,708","00:06:40,625",You're in my face.
18,"00:06:48,000","00:06:50,291",I don't love anything.
19,"00:06:50,666","00:06:52,833",How could I beat this chicken?
20,"00:06:53,333","00:06:54,333",New look.
21,"00:06:54,375","00:06:55,375","Yep, even better."
22,"00:06:55,625","00:06:56,625","Oh, look."
23,"00:06:57,125","00:06:59,125",The name is Boo.
24,"00:06:59,250","00:07:00,250","Hi, kid."
25,"00:07:00,625","00:07:01,250",You can do it.
26,"00:07:01,541","00:07:01,916",Hold on.
27,"00:07:02,166","00:07:02,666",Lay it on me.
28,"00:07:02,667","00:07:05,041","I mean, it takes a
bit to rotate the sails."
29,"00:07:05,416","00:07:05,750",Got it.
30,"00:07:05,750","00:07:06,750","No, no, no, no, no, no."
31,"00:07:11,000","00:07:12,999",It's called a hair whip.
32,"00:07:13,000","00:07:13,291",A hair whip.
33,"00:07:13,791","00:07:15,083",Let it from those guys.
34,"00:07:17,583","00:07:19,583","So, how did go this time?"
35,"00:07:20,375","00:07:21,583",You found something.
36,"00:07:22,041","00:07:25,375","It was in a clearing,
which I found a little help from."
37,"00:07:26,000","00:07:28,458","Hey, but this isn't from our village."
38,"00:07:28,833","00:07:31,875","I don't even know what
it's made of, but it's proof."
39,"00:07:32,500","00:07:35,458",There are other people out there.
40,"00:07:35,916","00:07:40,333","I don't know why we haven't
found them yet, but Dad, that island,"
41,"00:07:41,458","00:07:43,708",I think that's where they're going to be.
42,"00:07:44,416","00:07:47,250","I just have to figure
out how to find those stars."
43,"00:07:52,000","00:07:53,000",Little fish!
44,"00:07:53,041","00:07:54,041",Little fish!
45,"00:07:55,958","00:07:58,958",I thought you were gone forever.
46,"00:07:59,375","00:08:02,500","It was three days,
but I missed you every..."
47,"00:08:02,666","00:08:03,416",Mr. Baby.
48,"00:08:03,666","00:08:04,166",Bring you?
49,"00:08:04,541","00:08:06,083",You said you'd bring me a present.
50,"00:08:06,625","00:08:06,875",Hmm.
51,"00:08:07,500","00:08:08,833","Well, let me see."
52,"00:08:11,000","00:08:12,000",Whoa.
53,"00:08:12,708","00:08:13,708",What's it do?
54,"00:08:14,000","00:08:15,000",What's it not?
55,"00:08:17,083","00:08:18,291",Where are we going?
56,"00:08:27,000","00:08:33,083","This is the place of our ancestors,
where I learned our people are voyagers."
57,"00:08:35,000","00:08:37,500",Where Grandma showed me who we are.
58,"00:08:38,000","00:08:41,457","She said to Grandma
by the ear and tell him,"
59,"00:08:41,458","00:08:43,416",I am a one and I'm a two-newie.
60,"00:08:43,708","00:08:47,083","You'll board my boat and
restore the heart of the fishy."
61,"00:08:47,916","00:08:48,375",Pretty good.
62,"00:08:48,666","00:08:49,666",Yeah.
63,"00:08:50,083","00:08:51,375",How much did it take?
64,"00:08:52,541","00:08:53,166",A few weeks.
65,"00:08:53,458","00:08:53,708",Weeks?
66,"00:08:54,208","00:08:56,000",That's longer than forever.
67,"00:08:56,583","00:08:59,666","I know, but it was important."
68,"00:09:00,208","00:09:04,291","And if I hadn't fallen, I
never would have become a wayfinder."
69,"00:09:05,000","00:09:10,625","Like our ancient chiefs, like
the last great navigator, Taotai Busa."
70,"00:09:11,875","00:09:15,750","Before Maui stole
Timothy's heart and we stopped voyaging,"
71,"00:09:16,708","00:09:22,708","Taotai Busa wanted to connect our island
to all the people of the entire ocean."
72,"00:09:23,416","00:09:30,166","Because together, what we can
do, how far we all can go, it's endless."
73,"00:09:31,000","00:09:38,041","And now that I'm a wayfinder,
it's my job to continue what he started."
74,"00:09:38,916","00:09:42,416","And this, this is my first cool how."
75,"00:09:43,333","00:09:46,500","You should make Maui
go so you can stay with me."
76,"00:09:47,000","00:09:51,333","Well, Maui's out
demigodding, but if he ever shows up,"
77,"00:09:51,583","00:09:54,166","you'll grab him by
the ear and tell him that."
78,"00:10:32,000","00:10:38,541","I'm not here to cause trouble, just
a super chiseled demigodd passing through."
79,"00:10:39,041","00:10:43,125","Now open the portal to
the island and I'll be on my way."
80,"00:10:45,333","00:10:48,375","And why would I risk
breaking the rules for you"
81,"00:10:49,000","00:10:52,416","when you've already
caused my boss so much trouble?"
82,"00:10:52,958","00:10:53,166",Who?
83,"00:10:53,333","00:10:54,291",Maui started it.
84,"00:10:54,292","00:10:55,541",And you'll finish it?
85,"00:10:56,166","00:10:59,000",Team up with your precious human again.
86,"00:11:01,000","00:11:04,875","Team? You mean the girl with
the canoe and that goofy little chicken?"
87,"00:11:05,500","00:11:08,625","We weren't a team. I
just used her to get my hook."
88,"00:11:10,125","00:11:10,333",Ow!
89,"00:11:11,125","00:11:13,999","Nalo is a god, Maui."
90,"00:11:14,000","00:11:18,041","If you try to reconnect the
people of the ocean, he will destroy you."
91,"00:11:18,458","00:11:20,166",And then he'll destroy her too.
92,"00:11:20,500","00:11:22,458",This is between him and me.
93,"00:11:23,083","00:11:25,083",Moana has nothing to do with it.
94,"00:11:27,000","00:11:31,333","Ooh, you've made her a way by now, Maui."
95,"00:11:31,833","00:11:36,583","So now, she has everything to do with it."
96,"00:11:50,000","00:11:51,000",It's done!
97,"00:11:51,291","00:11:52,999",I'd like a sound like that.
98,"00:11:53,000","00:11:54,000",Woo hoot!
99,"00:11:58,375","00:12:06,375",Here you are.
100,"00:12:13,083","00:12:19,500","Well, eat up."
101,"00:12:20,000","00:12:21,583",We don't want the port getting old.
102,"00:12:24,916","00:12:26,000",Why don't you watch me now?
103,"00:12:26,833","00:12:27,833",Wanna.
104,"00:12:29,500","00:12:31,333",Tonight isn't just a feast.
105,"00:12:32,916","00:12:33,916","Long ago,"
106,"00:12:34,208","00:12:37,333","there was a title given
to the last great wayfinder."
107,"00:12:37,750","00:12:39,541",With dreams as big as yours.
108,"00:12:40,666","00:12:41,916",The sacred title.
109,"00:12:42,458","00:12:43,458",More than a chief.
110,"00:12:44,291","00:12:45,291",A tall tide.
111,"00:12:46,000","00:12:47,000",Leader.
112,"00:12:47,333","00:12:48,833",Connector of the entire sea.
113,"00:12:49,000","00:12:50,500",My dear.
114,"00:12:51,291","00:12:54,750","Would you honor us
tonight by accepting this title?"
115,"00:12:55,625","00:12:58,916","How people's first
tall tide in a thousand years."
116,"00:12:59,916","00:13:01,040",And show us all
117,"00:13:01,041","00:13:03,791",just how far we'll go.
118,"00:13:25,041","00:13:28,291","Tonight, we drink
from our ancestors' form."
119,"00:13:29,125","00:13:30,916",As tall tide us all once did.
120,"00:13:31,416","00:13:33,083",To bestow this title.
121,"00:13:34,000","00:13:35,000",On you.
122,"00:13:35,625","00:13:37,208",To connect to our past.
123,"00:13:37,708","00:13:38,708",Our present.
124,"00:13:39,375","00:13:41,416",And the future that lies beyond.
125,"00:13:42,916","00:13:46,000",May the ancestors continue to guide us.
126,"00:13:54,708","00:14:00,708","I am
honored to serve our people."
127,"00:14:03,958","00:14:06,625",May the ancestors continue to guide us.
128,"00:14:31,541","00:14:33,833",One truth may too be ...
129,"00:14:34,041","00:14:35,041",...under the stars.
130,"00:14:41,000","00:14:43,958",S
131,"00:15:24,000","00:15:26,291",You are my people.
132,"00:15:27,166","00:15:28,166",So type one.
133,"00:15:30,125","00:15:33,916","This is your future
if you cannot find others."
134,"00:15:35,041","00:15:39,125","In isolation, this
is how your story ends."
135,"00:15:40,000","00:15:41,708",I don't understand.
136,"00:15:42,000","00:15:44,291","Returning to
Hichi's heart was the beginning."
137,"00:15:45,000","00:15:46,708",You must brave the storm.
138,"00:15:47,500","00:15:48,791",Reconnect our people.
139,"00:15:49,958","00:15:51,166",Find Mochufetsu.
140,"00:15:51,666","00:15:53,958",I don't know how to reach it.
141,"00:15:54,208","00:15:57,040",A fire in the sky will guide you.
142,"00:15:57,041","00:15:59,916","Wait, I don't even know how far it is."
143,"00:16:01,166","00:16:03,166",Farther than I was able to go.
144,"00:16:06,291","00:16:07,833",Find Mochufetsu.
145,"00:16:09,000","00:16:12,458",Reconnect us all.
146,"00:16:21,375","00:16:22,375",Mochufetsu.
147,"00:16:23,125","00:16:26,458",The island I have to find is Mochufetsu.
148,"00:16:27,041","00:16:28,041",Okay.
149,"00:16:29,250","00:16:31,083","Took some searching, but..."
150,"00:16:34,166","00:16:35,166",Mochufetsu.
151,"00:16:36,000","00:16:37,000",What is it?
152,"00:16:37,666","00:16:43,166","An ancient island where the
channels of the ocean once came together,"
153,"00:16:44,000","00:16:51,666","connecting the people of the
entire sea until it was lost, cursed."
154,"00:16:53,916","00:16:59,291","In a terrible storm
of a power-hungry god, novel."
155,"00:17:02,000","00:17:08,958","He believed he'd be stronger by separating
the people of the ocean to weaken us,"
156,"00:17:09,708","00:17:11,458",to end our story.
157,"00:17:13,458","00:17:18,583","Our ancestors believed reaching
Mochufetsu would break Nalo's curse,"
158,"00:17:19,416","00:17:20,416",restore the channels.
159,"00:17:21,416","00:17:26,083","It's the only way to
bring our people together again."
160,"00:17:27,833","00:17:28,833",Or historians.
161,"00:17:30,500","00:17:33,125",We need to convene a council of people.
162,"00:17:56,000","00:17:57,208",Fire in the sky.
163,"00:17:58,333","00:17:59,750",He wants me to follow it.
164,"00:18:00,541","00:18:01,541",Two new stars.
165,"00:18:02,500","00:18:03,791",It could take a lifetime.
166,"00:18:04,750","00:18:06,791","Don't dive us. I
didn't make it back at all."
167,"00:18:07,250","00:18:10,208",It's a call from the ancestors to him.
168,"00:18:10,625","00:18:12,416",But if we never see her again...
169,"00:18:14,333","00:18:16,500",I do mean everything you want to get.
170,"00:18:17,000","00:18:19,166","Sami... No, I mean that's..."
171,"00:18:20,000","00:18:21,500",I don't want you to leave.
172,"00:18:33,000","00:18:35,125","Mom, it's..."
173,"00:18:36,000","00:18:38,583",It's so fast. What if...
174,"00:18:40,000","00:18:41,833","You're a tough time now, Moana."
175,"00:18:43,291","00:18:44,458",For some things...
176,"00:18:46,458","00:18:47,458",We never feel ready.
177,"00:21:39,583","00:21:40,583",My mom.
178,"00:21:42,791","00:21:46,125",I'll always be right beside you.
179,"00:21:46,666","00:21:50,625",But perhaps you're meant for more.
180,"00:21:52,625","00:21:55,500","Oh, what are you so worried about?"
181,"00:21:56,000","00:21:58,916",It's not like last time.
182,"00:22:00,166","00:22:02,958","Last time you
weren't old enough to understand."
183,"00:22:03,375","00:22:06,000","Oh, you could lose or learn."
184,"00:22:07,166","00:22:11,333","And here we are together
still just a little different."
185,"00:22:13,166","00:22:15,666",I can't see where your story leads.
186,"00:22:17,250","00:22:20,166",But we never stop choosing who we are.
187,"00:22:25,000","00:22:27,250",This is bigger than what you do.
188,"00:22:28,083","00:22:29,083",Bigger than us.
189,"00:22:30,000","00:22:36,666","So I will sail into this new sky to
reconnect the people of the entire ocean."
190,"00:22:37,208","00:22:40,416",And then I will return home.
191,"00:23:24,791","00:23:26,458","Moana, you need a crew."
192,"00:23:27,500","00:23:28,660","Hey, hey, Apuwa, don't count."
193,"00:23:29,208","00:23:30,916",It's the other side of the ocean.
194,"00:23:31,375","00:23:32,665",How could I ask them to?
195,"00:23:32,666","00:23:36,750",Our people will rise if you let them.
196,"00:23:37,625","00:23:39,625",Last time the chicken made it.
197,"00:23:42,625","00:23:44,833","Well, I'm going to need a bigger canal."
198,"00:23:45,916","00:23:48,124","Yes, brand new."
199,"00:23:48,125","00:23:48,333",Sleep.
200,"00:23:48,666","00:23:49,291",Double health design.
201,"00:23:49,292","00:23:50,625",My fist can do this.
202,"00:23:51,083","00:23:51,375",Sweet.
203,"00:23:51,750","00:23:52,999","I'm hoping to line
up greats with the crew."
204,"00:23:53,000","00:23:55,958",I'd like you on the crew.
205,"00:23:57,125","00:23:59,125","Well, we should do better than this."
206,"00:24:03,000","00:24:05,790",A farmer on the sea.
207,"00:24:05,791","00:24:07,431","We're going to
need to eat more than fish."
208,"00:24:08,000","00:24:09,000",You need irrigation.
209,"00:24:09,001","00:24:10,666",Plant propagation.
210,"00:24:11,000","00:24:12,625",Take even my best apprentice.
211,"00:24:13,041","00:24:14,041",Good stuff.
212,"00:24:14,708","00:24:14,916",Exactly.
213,"00:24:15,375","00:24:16,000",We need a master.
214,"00:24:16,333","00:24:17,333","Yes, you too."
215,"00:24:17,583","00:24:18,583","Thanks, Kelly."
216,"00:24:18,791","00:24:19,416",You're the best.
217,"00:24:19,416","00:24:20,416",I walked onto that one.
218,"00:24:21,333","00:24:23,875","Hey, Maui, it's been a while."
219,"00:24:24,916","00:24:30,291","I don't know where you are,
but I could really use your help."
220,"00:24:33,750","00:24:34,750",Maui!
221,"00:24:35,458","00:24:36,458","Oh, Moni."
222,"00:24:36,500","00:24:38,625","It's both of us, actually."
223,"00:24:39,750","00:24:41,083",Maui and me.
224,"00:24:42,041","00:24:43,291",It's part of a series.
225,"00:24:45,125","00:24:46,125",Wow.
226,"00:24:47,250","00:24:48,541",It's too bad Maui isn't here.
227,"00:24:48,791","00:24:50,871","We really need someone
who knows all the old stories."
228,"00:24:51,375","00:24:56,333","Someone who's like super
strong and has great hair and just..."
229,"00:24:56,791","00:24:58,332",I know someone else.
230,"00:24:58,333","00:24:59,333",Kind of like that?
231,"00:25:00,708","00:25:01,708",Yes!
232,"00:25:02,000","00:25:05,625","I'm going with Donna
on a call from the ancestors."
233,"00:25:06,416","00:25:07,416",Whoo!
234,"00:25:07,500","00:25:10,291","Get ready for some
eyewitness accounts, people."
235,"00:25:21,000","00:25:22,916",I'm coming with you.
236,"00:25:24,625","00:25:27,041",I'll be back as soon as I can.
237,"00:25:27,875","00:25:28,875",I promise.
238,"00:25:30,000","00:25:32,458",What if you don't come back?
239,"00:25:40,208","00:25:43,791",The ocean is my friend.
240,"00:25:48,166","00:25:54,833",Our friend.
241,"00:26:16,000","00:26:17,208",He connects us.
242,"00:26:23,541","00:26:29,291","So, there is nowhere I could
ever go that I won't be with you."
243,"00:26:29,625","00:26:30,625",Go.
244,"00:26:37,875","00:26:40,083",So you can take a piece of hold.
245,"00:28:09,000","00:28:12,500","Okay, okay, okay."
246,"00:28:13,000","00:28:14,000",One more time.
247,"00:28:14,916","00:28:18,541",This is not the end of our story.
248,"00:28:19,166","00:28:22,583",This is not where our destiny is denied.
249,"00:28:23,083","00:28:25,666","Together, we rise as one."
250,"00:28:26,416","00:28:29,166","Together, we take our freedom."
251,"00:28:35,000","00:28:36,374",That guy gets it.
252,"00:28:36,375","00:28:37,833","Yep, I made you handsome."
253,"00:28:38,916","00:28:42,250",Now all you gotta do is catch my hook.
254,"00:28:43,833","00:28:44,833",Come on.
255,"00:28:47,000","00:28:48,208","Yes, yes."
256,"00:28:48,666","00:28:49,458","Come on, you got it."
257,"00:28:49,666","00:28:50,866",That's what I'm talking about.
258,"00:28:51,333","00:28:52,500","Yes, keep doing it."
259,"00:28:53,000","00:28:54,000","That's it, higher."
260,"00:28:54,125","00:28:54,583",We're almost there.
261,"00:28:54,916","00:28:55,916",Just a little higher.
262,"00:29:13,000","00:29:14,208",Don't worry.
263,"00:29:14,666","00:29:16,466","Come on, you know
me, I'll get us out of here."
264,"00:29:17,958","00:29:20,125","No, I don't need her to save me."
265,"00:29:20,916","00:29:21,916",Again.
266,"00:29:23,208","00:29:24,208",Because she'll die.
267,"00:29:24,875","00:29:27,166","Melo hates humans
even more than he hates me."
268,"00:29:27,458","00:29:28,642",And let me tell you something.
269,"00:29:28,666","00:29:29,666",He hates me a lot.
270,"00:29:30,208","00:29:33,000","So the farther Curly is
from any of this, the better."
271,"00:29:33,541","00:29:36,833",We're on our own.
272,"00:29:38,708","00:29:39,958","Yeah, I got it."
273,"00:29:43,000","00:29:47,541","I would let you out, but I'm
really hoping to meet your little friend."
274,"00:29:48,458","00:29:49,541",I have plans for you both.
275,"00:29:51,000","00:29:54,708","Hey, hey, hey, enjoy your lunch."
276,"00:30:16,000","00:30:18,500","Melo, what are you doing?"
277,"00:30:18,791","00:30:20,000",I'm making improvements.
278,"00:30:20,833","00:30:21,125",Okay.
279,"00:30:21,126","00:30:24,708",Who is perfect as it is?
280,"00:30:25,083","00:30:26,083",The fictions of it.
281,"00:30:26,291","00:30:29,083","There is only
failing, then learning, then death."
282,"00:30:31,458","00:30:33,666",What is the order?
283,"00:30:34,041","00:30:35,041",Of course.
284,"00:30:35,208","00:30:37,000",That's why you're the wayfinder.
285,"00:30:38,458","00:30:39,708","No, no, no."
286,"00:30:43,000","00:30:47,208","Guys, the entire
ocean is kind of counting on us."
287,"00:30:47,416","00:30:48,000",We've got to rise to the moment.
288,"00:30:48,001","00:30:51,750","Stay on course and
kick everyone off the canoe."
289,"00:30:52,583","00:30:54,208","Wait, where's the harbor?"
290,"00:30:55,500","00:30:56,500",Ow.
291,"00:30:56,875","00:30:58,041",When will the canoe stop?
292,"00:30:59,250","00:30:59,458",Moving.
293,"00:31:00,000","00:31:01,791","Well, we're kind of on the ocean."
294,"00:31:02,958","00:31:04,082","Oh, Moni."
295,"00:31:04,083","00:31:06,000","Lotto, Moni's the other one."
296,"00:31:07,000","00:31:09,833","Guys, we'll never make it."
297,"00:31:10,000","00:31:10,166",What?
298,"00:31:10,791","00:31:12,583",If you don't embrace the ocean.
299,"00:31:12,916","00:31:13,934",He kind of breaks the liquid.
300,"00:31:13,958","00:31:14,999","Otto, I cannot swim."
301,"00:31:15,000","00:31:17,375",You don't use a human.
302,"00:31:18,958","00:31:21,040",Now everyone looks sad.
303,"00:31:21,041","00:31:23,999","And whoever designs
the canoe, forgot our macros."
304,"00:31:24,000","00:31:26,041","Yes, sir."
305,"00:31:32,000","00:31:34,291",I am unclear as to what you are doing.
306,"00:31:34,666","00:31:38,125","Guys, we want to reach
Motufetu, break Nalo's curse."
307,"00:31:38,458","00:31:40,041",We've got to come together.
308,"00:31:40,583","00:31:41,958",Find our friends.
309,"00:31:42,833","00:31:43,833",I don't use anyone.
310,"00:31:44,000","00:31:45,791","Oh, we'll see in the back."
311,"00:31:46,583","00:31:47,958",Don't be dead on your feet.
312,"00:31:48,458","00:31:49,958",It's time to live your own story.
313,"00:31:50,250","00:31:51,500",Even if you disagree.
314,"00:31:52,083","00:31:55,333",Try this mandatory look of trials.
315,"00:31:56,166","00:31:57,500",What could be better than this?
316,"00:31:57,875","00:31:59,165",It would be better than this.
317,"00:31:59,166","00:32:00,625",I'm sure it could be so great.
318,"00:32:01,083","00:32:02,458","Why, you just need your son."
319,"00:32:02,958","00:32:04,375",You can't live here forever.
320,"00:32:04,625","00:32:06,041",But it was all the fun.
321,"00:32:06,458","00:32:09,125","Don't you know it's
gathers better than you see?"
322,"00:32:10,500","00:32:11,999",Nothing is better than this.
323,"00:32:12,000","00:32:13,583",I'm going to be sick.
324,"00:45:02,000","00:45:04,750",Fascinating. It's like an acid.
325,"00:45:15,708","00:45:19,000",Can I get a chihu?
326,"00:45:20,666","00:45:22,000","Oh, yeah!"
327,"00:45:22,625","00:45:27,041",Now I just gotta get my baby.
328,"00:45:40,000","00:45:41,999","The tattoo, Mommy."
329,"00:45:42,000","00:45:45,208",Listen to me. I am a demi-god.
330,"00:45:46,000","00:45:47,833",I want to be slept by the tattoo.
331,"00:45:48,083","00:45:51,125",Hey! Okay. Rule number one.
332,"00:45:52,666","00:45:53,666",Okay.
333,"00:45:54,291","00:45:58,291","Roll me back. I'll
roll you back. Not him."
334,"00:45:59,041","00:46:02,416","This is what happens
when you meet your heroes."
335,"00:46:03,125","00:46:04,583","I know, right?"
336,"00:46:07,208","00:46:10,000","Rule number one.
You never saw me like this."
337,"00:46:10,416","00:46:13,625","Even though I still look very
cool. You look like a kidney stone."
338,"00:46:14,000","00:46:15,999","You look like someone
who would know what that is."
339,"00:46:16,000","00:46:17,000",Now.
340,"00:46:20,000","00:46:24,249","Well, hello, bacon.
Okay. I feel like there's"
341,"00:46:24,250","00:46:26,583","some back story that
I need to get caught up on."
342,"00:46:27,041","00:46:30,458","Actually, you know what? Scratch that.
I don't want to get attached if you all..."
343,"00:46:31,833","00:46:34,083","You know what?
Which... which... you guys won't."
344,"00:46:34,333","00:46:36,374","You're not gonna do that. I
don't even know why I said that."
345,"00:46:36,375","00:46:39,375","The point is, there's
some serious god stuff going down."
346,"00:46:42,000","00:46:43,250",So I'm gonna go handle my disc.
347,"00:46:45,125","00:46:53,125","Alright. Be back in a bit.
Until then, stay alive. Talk to no one."
348,"00:46:59,083","00:47:02,375","And if you see a crazy
bat lady, run. She is the worst."
349,"00:47:02,875","00:47:04,875",Stay away or you will die. Be good.
350,"00:47:05,458","00:47:06,458","Maui, out."
351,"00:47:08,250","00:47:10,791",Boat snack. Boat snack.
352,"00:47:13,416","00:47:14,416",Where's Moana?
353,"00:47:22,791","00:47:24,250",Simia? Simia!
354,"00:47:24,833","00:47:27,416",How are you here?
355,"00:47:28,083","00:47:33,999","I'm not. You got sucked inside
a giant, um, and her story will end."
356,"00:47:34,000","00:47:37,791","Cause now you will never
help the people of the ocean."
357,"00:47:38,208","00:47:42,625","And their ancestors will be
like, ""Moana, we hate you forever."""
358,"00:48:04,000","00:48:08,583",You got this.
359,"00:48:09,250","00:48:11,916",Here. You got this. You got this.
360,"00:48:14,583","00:48:17,708",Relax. I don't bite.
361,"00:48:18,583","00:48:19,583",Here come I.
362,"00:48:20,000","00:48:23,833","It's been a while
since I've seen a wayfinder."
363,"00:48:25,000","00:48:27,791","Love the oar. Would
you like to see me use it?"
364,"00:48:28,125","00:48:32,000","Ooh, feisty. We
have that in common, Moana."
365,"00:48:32,041","00:48:36,875",The human who's got all the gods talking.
366,"00:48:39,458","00:48:44,541","Who are you, Matani?
Guardian of this little slice of paradise."
367,"00:48:46,083","00:48:49,000",You live here?
368,"00:48:49,333","00:48:53,000","No, by choice. Maui never mentioned me."
369,"00:48:53,666","00:48:55,999","Probably too busy
playing with his tattoo."
370,"00:48:56,000","00:49:00,916","Well, come on then."
371,"00:49:01,750","00:49:04,833","Um, I'm not going anywhere with you."
372,"00:49:05,125","00:49:08,541","Get out of here, break
Nala's curse, find Motufetsu."
373,"00:49:09,833","00:49:12,791","Here to help. You
know the way to Motufetsu?"
374,"00:49:13,000","00:49:15,875","You think you can only
get somewhere if you know the way?"
375,"00:49:16,416","00:49:18,833",That's kind of what wave-biting is.
376,"00:49:20,000","00:49:22,000",So much to learn.
377,"00:49:25,000","00:49:29,500","A true wayfinder
doesn't know the path at all."
378,"00:49:29,916","00:49:34,541","That's the whole point. To find
your way to what's never been found."
379,"00:49:35,208","00:49:39,500","If you want to break Nala's curse,
you've got to stop playing and save Sis."
380,"00:49:39,875","00:49:40,875",Get a little lost.
381,"00:49:42,333","00:49:44,291",Why would I listen to anything you say?
382,"00:49:45,000","00:49:47,708",Because Nala trapped me too.
383,"00:49:49,250","00:49:53,958","I want you to beat
Nala. Because then, I'll be free."
384,"00:50:20,000","00:50:24,875","There's always another
way to get where you need to go."
385,"00:50:25,750","00:50:29,875","You just have to
think a little different."
386,"00:50:31,000","00:50:32,000",Different?
387,"00:50:32,791","00:50:33,791",Play it right?
388,"00:50:49,000","00:50:54,375","Let him save you, then I
know the rules around the bridge."
389,"00:50:55,833","00:50:56,916",It's time to get lost.
390,"00:50:59,208","00:51:00,541",He's terribly nice.
391,"00:51:01,208","00:51:03,166",You know you're questioning.
392,"00:51:04,000","00:51:06,125",Take a look around.
393,"00:51:07,208","00:51:11,041","I've got to let you up and
down, cause at the end you cannot drown."
394,"00:51:11,291","00:51:13,416",In the rain for memories.
395,"00:51:14,541","00:51:15,999",It's been too late to see.
396,"00:51:16,000","00:51:20,708","And put your trust in me,
because you've got potential and trouble."
397,"00:51:21,000","00:51:25,250","The distance are real
existential and lost through existence."
398,"00:51:25,500","00:51:28,666",And there is no map beyond estimation.
399,"00:51:29,416","00:51:32,500","No explanation,
please hold this equation."
400,"00:51:37,791","00:51:40,999","We're gonna get back,
come loose, and lose our way."
401,"00:51:41,000","00:51:44,833","There ain't no
time in holding that faith."
402,"00:51:45,166","00:51:48,208","You better not try the
thrill of living dangerously."
403,"00:51:49,000","00:51:51,583",You've got along a way to go keep crazy.
404,"00:51:51,875","00:51:56,208","You'll never know
the rules around the bridge."
405,"00:51:56,875","00:51:57,875",What is this?
406,"00:51:58,791","00:52:02,875",Don't you know how good you have it?
407,"00:52:03,625","00:52:06,375",You're all there stopping you.
408,"00:52:07,000","00:52:09,958","You want me, I'm stuck like static."
409,"00:52:10,375","00:52:11,375",Can you imagine?
410,"00:52:12,333","00:52:14,250",That life is time to carry the nerve.
411,"00:52:14,458","00:52:17,500","You've got a chance, don't take it."
412,"00:52:17,875","00:52:21,208","I know you're scared, but life's unfair."
413,"00:52:21,708","00:52:25,416","It's the truth of
choices making it small."
414,"00:52:26,541","00:52:30,166","Trust the fall, and you can have it all."
415,"00:52:32,000","00:52:35,208",You gotta come loose and lose your way.
416,"00:52:35,541","00:52:38,916","There ain't no
time in holding that faith."
417,"00:52:39,375","00:52:41,791","You better not try the
thrill of living dangerously."
418,"00:52:42,666","00:52:45,166",You've got along a way to go keep crazy.
419,"00:52:45,541","00:52:49,583","You'll never know
the rules around the bridge."
420,"00:52:52,000","00:52:53,000",What is this?
421,"00:52:54,041","00:52:56,791",What is this?
422,"00:52:58,000","00:52:59,000",You're all there.
423,"00:53:00,000","00:53:02,000",There's always another way in my life.
424,"00:53:02,708","00:53:03,708",What are you doing to me?
425,"00:53:07,208","00:53:08,208",You're all there.
426,"00:53:29,083","00:53:30,500","Oh, yeah."
427,"00:53:38,000","00:53:39,625",There's always another way.
428,"00:53:40,375","00:53:41,375",Order of the guards.
429,"00:53:42,708","00:53:45,083","One get you all the way to Motufi 2,"
430,"00:53:45,458","00:53:47,958","a little short on the
commute for you and your crew."
431,"00:53:48,791","00:53:50,291",And Mr. Coconut Oil.
432,"00:53:51,000","00:53:52,125",Who's Mr. Coconut Oil?
433,"00:53:53,000","00:53:55,500",I've always used my patience.
434,"00:53:56,416","00:53:59,500",Do not fear. You have been rescued.
435,"00:54:00,875","00:54:03,208","Kwa-ki-na, kwa-ki-na!"
436,"00:54:03,666","00:54:05,833","We're home, we're home!"
437,"00:54:06,666","00:54:07,666",Please!
438,"00:54:15,000","00:54:16,583",She's opening.
439,"00:54:29,708","00:54:31,374",They're such a plan.
440,"00:54:31,375","00:54:34,332","They keep you in a snack game
because you want us to go together?"""
441,"00:54:34,333","00:54:37,208","Well, I certainly did not
keep you for the conversation."
442,"00:54:37,833","00:54:38,833","Oh, wait."
443,"00:54:40,000","00:54:41,875","Well, shall we?"
444,"00:54:45,541","00:54:47,083",Do you... can't leave?
445,"00:54:48,250","00:54:49,291",Break Nalo's curse.
446,"00:54:50,000","00:54:52,833","And maybe one day
we'll see each other again"
447,"00:54:54,083","00:54:56,958",Remember there's always another way
448,"00:54:57,458","00:55:00,541",Even if you have to get lost to find it
449,"00:55:01,000","00:55:02,625",Good luck. Hold by one
450,"00:55:03,625","00:55:08,790",You got this
451,"00:55:08,791","00:55:15,708","Let Nalo find out I
helped will die by lightning"
452,"00:55:15,875","00:55:16,875",Huh?
453,"00:55:18,291","00:55:19,291",Molly looks good
454,"00:55:22,833","00:55:25,375",Woah! I'm kissing the pig!
455,"00:55:26,291","00:55:28,458",We're in a portal of the gods!
456,"00:55:29,041","00:55:29,250",Hey!
457,"00:55:29,833","00:55:30,958",Hey guys!
458,"00:55:31,416","00:55:32,416",I got her again!
459,"00:55:32,708","00:55:33,708",Plus Molly?
460,"00:55:33,875","00:55:34,875",Where's Molly?
461,"00:55:35,541","00:55:36,208",What's up girlie?
462,"00:55:36,458","00:55:37,458",Molly!
463,"00:55:39,000","00:55:41,583","You could have told
me we were doing new outfits"
464,"00:55:41,833","00:55:43,833","But Rocket leaves on
my cheeks for a thousand years"
465,"00:55:43,875","00:55:45,750",Oh! I can't believe we're here!
466,"00:55:46,208","00:55:47,666","Hey buddy, I missed ya!"
467,"00:55:49,833","00:55:51,749","Oh! Sorry, that was weird"
468,"00:55:51,750","00:55:52,750",Is that weird?
469,"00:55:53,333","00:55:55,125",This is the craziest thing in my life
470,"00:55:56,833","00:55:59,582",Love this guy! Not creeping me out at all
471,"00:55:59,583","00:56:00,750",Gotta join me for a second
472,"00:56:01,833","00:56:03,625",This is cool!
473,"00:56:03,875","00:56:05,124",Oh! And did you meet the papa mora?
474,"00:56:05,125","00:56:06,290",I thought he'd do this in a climb
475,"00:56:06,291","00:56:07,749",But it turned out to be super great
476,"00:56:07,750","00:56:10,415","Because otherwise I
never would have met Montagny"
477,"00:56:10,416","00:56:11,083",Who's great by the way
478,"00:56:11,083","00:56:11,833",And now you!
479,"00:56:11,875","00:56:13,875","And now we're gonna
bring all of us together"
480,"00:56:14,833","00:56:16,333","Sorry, you go"
481,"00:56:16,833","00:56:18,458",You're all gonna die
482,"00:56:20,833","00:56:21,833",What?
483,"00:56:22,916","00:56:23,083",What?
484,"00:56:23,250","00:56:25,708",Nalo didn't just hide Motofetu in a storm
485,"00:56:25,833","00:56:27,999",He hid it in a monster storm
486,"00:56:28,000","00:56:30,207",In a cursed ocean you can't escape from
487,"00:56:30,208","00:56:32,708",And then sunk into the bottom of the sea
488,"00:56:32,833","00:56:35,290",Which means a human can't reach it
489,"00:56:35,291","00:56:36,999",So unless I break the curse
490,"00:56:37,000","00:56:39,124","You just bought a
one way ticket to Densville"
491,"00:56:39,125","00:56:40,832","Which is why I didn't want
you coming out in the first place"
492,"00:56:40,833","00:56:43,957","Because now you're
stuck and you're gonna die"
493,"00:56:43,958","00:56:45,249",Your crew's gonna die
494,"00:56:45,250","00:56:47,208",And this time so is the chicken
495,"00:56:53,833","00:56:57,040",But it's great to see you
496,"00:56:57,041","00:56:58,833",And we're here
497,"00:57:10,833","00:57:11,833",And we?
498,"00:57:13,000","00:57:16,666",But this place looks perfectly nice
499,"00:57:17,833","00:57:18,833",And look!
500,"00:57:19,416","00:57:20,416",A constellation!
501,"00:57:20,750","00:57:22,125",It's right there!
502,"00:57:24,583","00:57:27,207","Guys, the ancestors wouldn't have called"
503,"00:57:27,208","00:57:28,708",If we couldn't do this
504,"00:57:28,833","00:57:30,000",Unless it was a bot dial
505,"00:57:30,833","00:57:32,500",That'll make sense in two thousand years
506,"00:57:32,833","00:57:34,790",Tell Tybaza said reaching Motofetu
507,"00:57:34,791","00:57:37,749","Is the only way to
give our people a future"
508,"00:57:37,750","00:57:38,791",If you know so much
509,"00:57:38,875","00:57:41,000",How come he didn't tell you it was f♪♪♪
510,"00:57:41,833","00:57:42,333",Suck
511,"00:57:42,833","00:57:46,666","Because he told me to
follow the fire in the sky"
512,"00:57:46,833","00:57:48,708",That led me straight to you
513,"00:57:48,833","00:57:50,625",Which makes sense
514,"00:57:50,833","00:57:54,750","Because if Nalo thinks he's
stronger by keeping people apart"
515,"00:57:54,833","00:57:58,583","Then maybe the way to
break his curse is by coming together"
516,"00:57:58,833","00:58:02,333",You lift the island and I step on it
517,"00:58:02,666","00:58:03,666",Mommy and Moana!
518,"00:58:03,875","00:58:04,791",You're doing it again
519,"00:58:04,833","00:58:05,833",You're so amazing
520,"00:58:06,833","00:58:07,541",This is gonna work
521,"00:58:07,833","00:58:08,916",Right? Ocean?
522,"00:58:11,000","00:58:12,000",Ocean?
523,"00:58:18,541","00:58:19,541","Moana,"
524,"00:58:20,166","00:58:21,166",The ocean
525,"00:58:21,833","00:58:24,416",Cannot help you here
526,"00:58:30,250","00:58:31,250",Grandma!
527,"00:58:32,833","00:58:34,083","Actually,"
528,"00:58:34,833","00:58:36,833",I believe that's a welcome gift
529,"00:58:39,250","00:58:39,791",From Nalo
530,"00:58:39,792","00:58:47,792","Take that, sucka!"
531,"00:59:01,833","00:59:04,833","Humans, get your positions,
work together, and let's do this!"
532,"00:59:07,833","00:59:10,583","We really gotta talk
about your quitting process"
533,"00:59:11,833","00:59:13,000",Rabs!
534,"00:59:13,250","00:59:14,250",Down below
535,"00:59:14,833","00:59:16,166",Hate these guys
536,"00:59:16,833","00:59:17,957",I'm an elder
537,"00:59:17,958","00:59:19,416",And I'm three thousand years old
538,"00:59:19,833","00:59:21,500","Which makes me elder, Earl"
539,"00:59:22,833","00:59:24,832",Just gotta outrun them till sunrise
540,"00:59:24,833","00:59:26,500","Oh, I didn't open up"
541,"00:59:26,833","00:59:27,874","Uh, sure"
542,"00:59:27,875","00:59:32,833","Oh, yeah!"
543,"00:59:38,833","00:59:39,916",Woohoo!
544,"00:59:41,833","00:59:43,041",Did he just freak out?
545,"00:59:46,833","00:59:48,041",Behind us!
546,"00:59:48,958","00:59:52,625","If Moana becomes turned
that time to this title, it'll work!"
547,"00:59:55,833","00:59:56,833","Oh, no!"
548,"00:59:59,833","01:00:00,833",Wait!
549,"01:00:03,833","01:00:04,833",Woah!
550,"01:00:05,833","01:00:06,833",Wait!
551,"01:00:08,833","01:00:10,625",Woah!
552,"01:00:10,916","01:00:11,916","Hey, what?"
553,"01:00:13,083","01:00:14,083",What?
554,"01:00:15,458","01:00:16,458",No!
555,"01:00:19,166","01:00:20,166",Moana!
556,"01:00:33,208","01:00:37,458",Moana!
557,"01:00:37,833","01:00:45,833",Moana! Moana!
558,"01:01:10,583","01:01:12,000","Well, figure this out"
559,"01:01:12,875","01:01:14,416","Yeah, sister Moana"
560,"01:01:23,833","01:01:25,790",Don't tell Fazza's!
561,"01:01:25,791","01:01:26,791",I know!
562,"01:01:28,833","01:01:34,250","Uh, uh, uh, it's a
bad time to say I told you so"
563,"01:01:34,833","01:01:37,353","So I'm not gonna do that,
because that would make you feel worse"
564,"01:01:37,833","01:01:39,290",But I believe in you
565,"01:01:39,291","01:01:40,415",No one else does
566,"01:01:40,416","01:01:42,499","There you go, walk it off, camp"
567,"01:01:42,500","01:01:44,791",What? I must be nice!
568,"01:01:45,250","01:01:47,708","Ow! No purple, no purple, stop!"
569,"01:01:48,250","01:01:49,500","Okay, I'll talk to her"
570,"01:01:56,541","01:02:00,083","I know, Maui, it's just..."
571,"01:02:03,041","01:02:09,958","Every time I think I know what
I'm supposed to do, everything changes"
572,"01:02:10,833","01:02:12,291",I can't...
573,"01:02:13,291","01:02:14,291",Moana almost died!
574,"01:02:14,833","01:02:21,541","If I'm the reason her
people's story just... ends..."
575,"01:02:25,583","01:02:26,583",This is serious!
576,"01:02:26,958","01:02:28,250",Is something distracting you?
577,"01:02:28,875","01:02:30,540",Maybe breaking the curses like you said
578,"01:02:30,541","01:02:31,832",We gotta work together
579,"01:02:31,833","01:02:35,958","I pull it from the sea, but
a human has to land on its shores"
580,"01:02:38,833","01:02:41,832","Look, I get it"
581,"01:02:41,833","01:02:43,249","No one else can do this Look, I get it"
582,"01:02:43,250","01:02:45,333",No one likes sucking at their job
583,"01:02:45,833","01:02:47,541",Why are you even here?
584,"01:02:48,000","01:02:53,166",Because... because I've been low before
585,"01:02:53,833","01:02:57,500",And I couldn't see a way forward
586,"01:02:58,833","01:03:00,791",And then someone came along

676,"01:06:37,833","01:06:44,041",I know what I've asked you is a lot
677,"01:06:44,833","01:06:48,000",That our canoe is in really rough shape
678,"01:06:48,833","01:06:52,833",But I believe that together we...
679,"01:07:13,125","01:07:15,500",We found a way to fix it
680,"01:07:15,875","01:07:17,582","A little help from the ancestors, man"
681,"01:07:17,583","01:07:19,582",I did the decorations
682,"01:07:19,583","01:07:21,957",We used the chicken
683,"01:07:21,958","01:07:23,874",Respect
684,"01:07:23,875","01:07:31,249",Nala wants to end our story
685,"01:07:31,250","01:07:31,791",But we're not letting that happen
686,"01:07:31,791","01:07:31,831",We're not letting that happen
687,"01:07:31,832","01:07:33,809","We're not letting that happen We're not letting that happen We're not letting
that happen We're not letting that happen But we're not letting that happen"
688,"01:07:33,833","01:07:35,583",We just have to outsmart him
689,"01:07:35,833","01:07:37,915","Find some new
traits he's never seen before"
690,"01:07:37,916","01:07:41,666","Well, I have been working on some ideas"
691,"01:07:41,833","01:07:44,250","Also, we do have a demigod"
692,"01:07:44,833","01:07:46,290","Sure, he's a little scruffy"
693,"01:07:46,291","01:07:47,915",But I get out better than nothing
694,"01:07:47,916","01:07:49,082",I think you'll agree
695,"01:07:49,083","01:07:52,916","Okay, we sail to
the heart of Nala's storm"
696,"01:07:53,833","01:07:58,166","Once I raise the
island, you all have to get to it"
697,"01:07:58,916","01:08:00,833","It would be harder
than anything we faced before"
698,"01:08:01,875","01:08:02,916",So if anyone wants to...
699,"01:08:07,291","01:08:11,958","I spent my whole life
learning our people's stories"
700,"01:08:12,833","01:08:17,708","Because of you, I get to live for it"
701,"01:08:19,541","01:08:20,541",Alright then
702,"01:08:20,833","01:08:23,208",Let's break a curse

I pulled an island from the sea"
704,"01:08:32,833","01:08:34,153",I know I have to bend it to knees
705,"01:08:34,833","01:08:36,374",I have great posture
706,"01:08:36,375","01:08:40,791",You know what? You farted

709,"01:08:46,833","01:08:47,500",That's beautiful
710,"01:08:47,501","01:08:49,000","Okay, we do this"
711,"01:08:49,833","01:08:51,583",We make it home
712,"01:08:52,875","01:08:54,499",Curly
713,"01:08:54,500","01:09:00,833",Is this work?
714,"01:09:01,833","01:09:03,208",I'm doing it one
715,"01:09:20,833","01:09:23,166","Well, now I kind
of miss a lot of monsters"
716,"01:09:28,833","01:09:30,500","Ah, it's a big wave"
717,"01:09:32,833","01:09:35,415",We can go around it
718,"01:09:35,416","01:09:36,915",Everyone get to your position

723,"01:09:45,833","01:09:46,833",It's bowie time
724,"01:09:47,833","01:09:52,250","Let's lift an island and
show the swing back who's boss"
