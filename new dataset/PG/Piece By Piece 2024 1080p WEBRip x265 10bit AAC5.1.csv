563,"00:32:27,320","00:32:29,072","And I'm, like,
immediately blown away."
564,"00:32:29,113","00:32:31,824","Like, blown away.
And I was like, ""Holy..."""
565,"00:32:35,745","00:32:38,414","Wow. Like, this is great."
566,"00:32:41,668","00:32:43,586","I didn't have
a manager. I was like..."
567,"00:32:43,628","00:32:44,796","Yo, you be my manager."
568,"00:32:44,837","00:32:46,089",Manage you?
569,"00:32:46,130","00:32:47,548","Yo, I don't know anything
about management."
570,"00:32:47,590","00:32:48,591",I'm an intern.
571,"00:32:48,633","00:32:50,635","Well, we can learn together."
572,"00:32:51,469","00:32:53,513","So I was like,
""All right, let's do it."""
573,"00:32:55,264","00:32:57,892","After that, we went crazy."
574,"00:33:02,897","00:33:04,649","Every week, we'd send out tapes"
575,"00:33:04,691","00:33:07,944","and then he would market them
around as best as he could."
576,"00:33:07,986","00:33:09,654","Five to ten new beats a week,"
577,"00:33:09,696","00:33:13,116","and then I would then go around
to the A&Rs, to the artists."
578,"00:33:13,157","00:33:14,534",I was sleeping in lobbies.
579,"00:33:14,575","00:33:15,952",Whatever I had to do.

585,"00:33:24,252","00:33:25,545","We met everybody
that was somebody."
586,"00:33:25,586","00:33:28,089","And Pharrell was coming
full throttle."
587,"00:33:29,215","00:33:30,717","Like, ""I'm coming for the crown."
588,"00:33:30,758","00:33:32,969","I'm coming for you.

609,"00:34:29,484","00:34:31,569","I had to have a talk
with Pharrell."
610,"00:34:31,611","00:34:34,405","Like, he had no money,
my unemployment ran out,"
611,"00:34:34,447","00:34:36,240","we're all living

613,"00:34:39,243","00:34:40,286",I said...

kill yourself in this thing."
618,"00:34:47,376","00:34:50,088","Yeah, yeah, yeah.
But, hey, I'm an artist."
619,"00:34:50,129","00:34:53,758","But selling beats,
that's a way to get in."
620,"00:34:56,886","00:34:58,471","Okay, fine."
621,"00:35:01,015","00:35:02,391","At the time,"
622,"00:35:02,433","00:35:04,727","I chose to look at it
the wrong way,"
623,"00:35:04,769","00:35:06,771","to think that, like,
I was being rejected."
624,"00:35:06,813","00:35:10,274","I didn't realize that I was
being told to train harder."
625,"00:35:13,236","00:35:14,612","-Hey, N.O.R.E.
-Hey, what's going on?"

-How you doing, Morgan?"

629,"00:35:21,077","00:35:22,620","So, I was just wondering,"
630,"00:35:22,662","00:35:24,622","how did you know about
The Neptunes?"
631,"00:35:24,664","00:35:27,083","What was it like
when you first met them?"
632,"00:35:27,125","00:35:28,459",Uh...
633,"00:35:28,501","00:35:31,087","I first met Pharrell
because Rob Walker."
634,"00:35:32,839","00:35:35,258","And at the time, I had
never heard of The Neptunes."
635,"00:35:35,299","00:35:36,759","Two dudes, one Filipino"
636,"00:35:36,801","00:35:38,594","and the other Black,
from Virginia Beach?"
637,"00:35:38,636","00:35:41,848","Come on. This is--
This doesn't even make sense."
638,"00:35:41,889","00:35:43,391","But they played me one beat,"
639,"00:35:43,432","00:35:45,268","then they played me
another beat."
640,"00:35:52,650","00:35:54,777","I remember
I was on my way to Miami"
641,"00:35:54,819","00:35:56,779","and Pharrell said,
""This third beat..."""
642,"00:35:56,821","00:36:00,283","This third beat, don't listen
to that until you get to Miami."
643,"00:36:00,324","00:36:02,201","Why? Why wouldn't I listen
to this third beat?"
644,"00:36:02,243","00:36:03,619","And he's like, ""Yo, listen."""
645,"00:36:03,661","00:36:05,204","People take my beat sometimes,"
646,"00:36:05,246","00:36:07,290",but people don't let me produce.
647,"00:36:07,331","00:36:09,167",I want to produce this.
648,"00:36:10,001","00:36:11,460",No one had talked to me

650,"00:36:16,674","00:36:18,467","It took everything for me
in the world"
651,"00:36:18,509","00:36:20,803",not to listen to track three.
652,"00:36:23,472","00:36:25,725","I remember the hotel
like it was yesterday,"
653,"00:36:25,766","00:36:28,144","and that's when I actually
listened to track three,"
654,"00:36:28,186","00:36:29,478","called ""Superthug."""
655,"00:36:38,529","00:36:41,616","I took a risk with

a little skeptical"
683,"00:37:54,605","00:37:56,607",because Pharrell purposely
684,"00:37:56,649","00:38:00,278","wanted to make hip-hop but
not look like a hip-hop star."
685,"00:38:01,696","00:38:03,906","You know, it's like opening
a bakery shop, right?"

724,"00:39:33,913","00:39:35,373",I knew Pharrell.
