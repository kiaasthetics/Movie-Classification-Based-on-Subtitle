2,"00:01:03,849","00:01:05,470","Yes, you got doughnuts."
3,"00:01:05,770","00:01:06,990",I already ate all the balsam cream.
4,"00:01:08,350","00:01:08,870",Kyle?
5,"00:01:15,150","00:01:17,390",This place gives me the creeps.
6,"00:01:17,950","00:01:20,850","Relax, that popsicle hasn't moved in 50 years."
7,"00:01:57,910","00:01:58,830",Someone's hacking the system.
8,"00:01:59,170","00:01:59,470",What?
9,"00:01:59,710","00:02:01,270",The containment tank is destabilizing.
10,"00:02:01,950","00:02:03,010",He's waking up.
11,"00:03:38,470","00:03:39,670",We need more guys.
12,"00:03:40,350","00:03:41,550",That is all the guys.
13,"00:04:17,200","00:04:17,959",Wait a second.
14,"00:04:18,600","00:04:19,860",I thought we were going tubing.
15,"00:04:20,380","00:04:21,140","Hold on, hold on."
16,"00:04:21,380","00:04:22,580",Is this a race?
17,"00:04:22,740","00:04:24,040",You're going down.
18,"00:04:24,040","00:04:28,340",It is my destiny to claim the throne of family champion hedgehog.
19,"00:04:29,100","00:04:29,500",Cute.
20,"00:04:29,900","00:04:32,680",Are you sure you want to challenge the fastest creature in the universe?
21,"00:04:33,000","00:04:34,480","I mean, that's kind of my whole brand."
22,"00:04:35,820","00:04:38,240","Okay, Tom and Maddie, count us down."
23,"00:04:39,100","00:04:41,080","Don't worry, little sibling, rivalry is healthy."
24,"00:04:41,200","00:04:42,940",Me and my brothers used to do this kind of thing all the time.
25,"00:04:43,060","00:04:46,160","Tom, your brothers are lunatics, and neither of them were born with the power to trigger"
26,"00:04:46,160","00:04:47,540",a global cataclysmic event.
27,"00:04:48,120","00:04:48,960",That's a fair point.
28,"00:04:49,020","00:04:49,600","Did you hear that, boys?"
29,"00:04:49,920","00:04:51,280","No cataclysmic events, okay?"
30,"00:04:51,340","00:04:52,700",Let's keep this cataclysmic-less.
31,"00:04:52,700","00:04:54,500",I'm a stronghold of the donuts.
32,"00:04:54,740","00:04:58,680","Then on your marks, get set, go!"
33,"00:05:00,460","00:05:04,920","And away out in front, to the surprise of absolutely no one, it's the blue blur, the"
34,"00:05:04,920","00:05:07,280","red chute rocket, the one, the only..."
35,"00:05:07,280","00:05:08,520","Come on, Sonic!"
36,"00:05:09,020","00:05:09,500",Hedgehog!
37,"00:05:11,340","00:05:12,720","What, the what now?"
38,"00:05:12,840","00:05:14,800","I am also defeating you, hedgehog."
39,"00:05:14,920","00:05:15,340",Seriously?
40,"00:05:15,900","00:05:16,680","All right, you know what?"
41,"00:05:16,880","00:05:18,540",Time to light the afterburners.
42,"00:05:20,220","00:05:21,120",It's a bird!
43,"00:05:21,440","00:05:22,260",It's a plane!
44,"00:05:22,260","00:05:24,280",It's air hedgehog!
45,"00:05:38,000","00:05:38,440",Yes!
46,"00:05:38,980","00:05:39,780",I did it!
47,"00:05:40,780","00:05:41,220",I...
48,"00:05:42,320","00:05:42,760",Lost?
49,"00:05:43,020","00:05:43,940",How is that even possible?
50,"00:05:44,000","00:05:45,040",I do not lose!
51,"00:05:45,280","00:05:47,280","I am also defeating you, hedgehog."
52,"00:05:47,400","00:05:48,940","Okay, okay, I get it, man."
53,"00:05:49,100","00:05:49,900",No need to rub it in.
54,"00:05:50,100","00:05:51,400","Come on, Sonic!"
55,"00:05:51,400","00:05:52,500",Catch up!
56,"00:05:52,580","00:05:52,940",Yeah!
57,"00:05:54,000","00:05:55,400","Wait, what's going on?"
58,"00:05:56,460","00:05:56,880",Ah!
59,"00:05:57,320","00:05:58,600",Why are you guys acting like...
60,"00:06:00,760","00:06:01,360",Holograms?
61,"00:06:01,660","00:06:06,260","Which means, I remain the undefeated speed champion of all time!"
62,"00:06:06,480","00:06:06,880",Yes!
63,"00:06:07,180","00:06:08,340",And the crowd goes wild!
64,"00:06:08,460","00:06:09,760","But also, what's going on?"
65,"00:06:14,800","00:06:15,400",Surprise!
66,"00:06:16,900","00:06:19,520","Wait a second, you guys, what is all this?"
67,"00:06:19,520","00:06:21,600",Happy Be-Arthur Day?
68,"00:06:22,380","00:06:24,860","Oh, it's Happy Be-Earth Day."
69,"00:06:25,100","00:06:27,560","Today is the anniversary of the day you came to Earth, bud."
70,"00:06:27,640","00:06:29,120",It's your Earth Day birthday.
71,"00:06:29,460","00:06:32,880","So the race was just a distraction, which I totally didn't bowl for, by the way."
72,"00:06:32,940","00:06:33,680","Good try, though."
73,"00:06:33,880","00:06:35,660",So you could throw a party for me?
74,"00:06:36,140","00:06:38,280","Today we honor you, hedgehog."
75,"00:06:38,460","00:06:41,400","If it wasn't for you, none of us would be here right now."
76,"00:06:41,600","00:06:42,520","The boys are right, bud."
77,"00:06:43,260","00:06:46,300","You know, the day you came to this planet is the day all our lives changed forever."
78,"00:06:46,480","00:06:47,380",And we became a family.
79,"00:06:49,520","00:06:52,100","You guys, I don't... I don't know what to say."
80,"00:06:53,260","00:06:53,820",Except...
81,"00:06:53,820","00:06:55,000",Let's party!
82,"00:06:56,420","00:06:56,980",Yeah!
83,"00:06:58,200","00:07:00,880",It's now on to the break of dawn!
84,"00:07:04,220","00:07:05,760",Thanks for the surprise party.
85,"00:07:06,140","00:07:07,280",It really means a lot to me.
86,"00:07:07,520","00:07:08,580","Yeah, you deserve it, pal."
87,"00:07:10,680","00:07:11,720",No way!
88,"00:07:12,120","00:07:12,640",Is that...
89,"00:07:13,400","00:07:13,880",What?
90,"00:07:14,300","00:07:17,260","Dude, you're just for once walking my speed."
91,"00:07:22,570","00:07:23,050",Whoa!
92,"00:07:25,630","00:07:26,470",This is your...
93,"00:07:26,470","00:07:26,690",Yep.
94,"00:07:27,250","00:07:28,210",My old cave.
95,"00:07:28,610","00:07:29,050","Oh, man."
96,"00:07:29,650","00:07:31,610",I can't believe this is where you lived all those years.
97,"00:07:32,350","00:07:32,850","Hey, hey!"
98,"00:07:33,130","00:07:34,870",My state-of-the-art security system!
99,"00:07:37,270","00:07:38,590",It still works.
100,"00:07:39,370","00:07:39,930","Hey, bud."
101,"00:07:41,790","00:07:42,450",What's this?
102,"00:07:45,770","00:07:46,250",Wow.
103,"00:07:46,710","00:07:49,050","You know, I drew that on my first night on Earth."
104,"00:07:49,810","00:07:51,530",I wanted to remember where I came from.
105,"00:07:54,420","00:07:55,160",I still miss her.
106,"00:07:56,740","00:07:58,600",You think Longclaw would be proud of me?
107,"00:07:59,940","00:08:00,820","I know she would, pal."
108,"00:08:02,020","00:08:04,360","Because even though you lost her at such a young age,"
109,"00:08:05,320","00:08:07,320",you didn't let your pain change who you are.
110,"00:08:08,980","00:08:09,600",In here.
111,"00:08:12,470","00:08:13,230",In my lungs.
112,"00:08:14,990","00:08:15,730",Or your heart.
113,"00:08:16,270","00:08:16,850","Heart, right."
114,"00:08:16,990","00:08:17,750","Yeah, makes more sense."
115,"00:08:17,790","00:08:18,430","Not lungs, heart."
116,"00:08:18,850","00:08:20,090","That's the thing about life, Sonic."
117,"00:08:20,110","00:08:21,790",It's all about the choices we make.
118,"00:08:22,970","00:08:24,290","You're gonna make some good ones, and..."
119,"00:08:24,950","00:08:26,430","knowing you, you're gonna make some bad ones."
120,"00:08:29,280","00:08:29,660",But...
121,"00:08:29,660","00:08:31,100","as long as you remember to listen to your heart,"
122,"00:08:32,320","00:08:34,000",you're gonna make the right choice when it matters the most.
123,"00:08:35,039","00:08:35,520",Thanks.
124,"00:08:36,240","00:08:37,659",I don't know what I'd do without you.
125,"00:08:38,159","00:08:40,820",I'd probably be a totally different hedgehog.
126,"00:08:52,820","00:08:53,300",2024?
127,"00:08:54,600","00:08:57,100",I've been trapped for 50 years?
128,"00:08:59,660","00:09:00,300",Yes!
129,"00:09:08,950","00:09:15,060",Why won't you leave me alone?
130,"00:09:17,940","00:09:23,230",I have dishonored my marshmallow.
131,"00:09:24,130","00:09:26,790",It's really just a question of temperature and distance.
132,"00:09:27,370","00:09:28,410",It's not a competition.
133,"00:09:31,290","00:09:32,130",This is so nice.
134,"00:09:32,670","00:09:33,270",Peace.
135,"00:09:33,790","00:09:34,290",Quiet.
136,"00:09:34,810","00:09:35,210",Finally.
137,"00:09:36,250","00:09:36,910",Finally.
138,"00:09:47,870","00:09:48,270",Hey!
139,"00:09:48,630","00:09:51,070",We're trying to have a family movement down here!
140,"00:10:44,960","00:10:46,320",Mr. and Mrs. Wachowski.
141,"00:10:48,280","00:10:48,680",Aliens.
142,"00:10:49,580","00:10:49,980",Aliens?
143,"00:10:50,220","00:10:51,080",Excuse me?
144,"00:10:51,200","00:10:52,620",It's not like we're from different planets.
145,"00:10:52,700","00:10:53,320","Oh, yeah, we are."
146,"00:10:53,460","00:10:54,380",I guess we are alien.
147,"00:10:54,640","00:10:55,140",Please keep your distance.
148,"00:10:55,140","00:10:55,600",Continue.
149,"00:10:55,820","00:10:56,680",I'm Director Rockwell.
150,"00:10:57,000","00:11:00,320",There is a very dangerous situation unfolding right now in Tokyo.
151,"00:11:01,120","00:11:04,900",Commander Walters is requesting Team Sonic's immediate assistance.
152,"00:11:05,300","00:11:06,080",Team Sonic?
153,"00:11:06,300","00:11:07,480",Who picked that name?
154,"00:11:07,760","00:11:08,240",Love it.
155,"00:11:08,360","00:11:09,080",Ten out of ten.
156,"00:11:09,280","00:11:09,880",No notes.
157,"00:11:10,160","00:11:12,600","Tom and Maddie, put the s'mores on ice,"
158,"00:11:12,740","00:11:15,960",because Team Sonic is off to save the day!
159,"00:11:22,780","00:11:23,420",Remember!
160,"00:11:24,720","00:11:26,440",Make good choices!
161,"00:11:39,880","00:11:42,920",Good evening and welcome to Tails Air Flight 1012.
162,"00:11:43,200","00:11:45,640",We're looking at an on-time arrival into Tokyo.
163,"00:11:46,220","00:11:46,840","Okay, Captain."
164,"00:11:47,020","00:11:48,320",We got a rogue alien on the loose.
165,"00:11:48,500","00:11:49,280",How do we find him?
166,"00:11:51,940","00:11:53,960","Uh, start with the giant fireball?"
167,"00:11:54,260","00:11:55,000",I love it.
168,"00:11:55,060","00:11:56,640",Let's start with the giant fireball.
169,"00:12:00,200","00:12:01,620","Finally, some action."
170,"00:12:02,180","00:12:03,920","Okay, time to gear up."
171,"00:12:04,680","00:12:05,640",Titanium handcuffs.
172,"00:12:05,920","00:12:07,440",Completely indestructible.
173,"00:12:07,840","00:12:09,760","I don't need your silly gizmos, Fox."
174,"00:12:09,940","00:12:10,760",And you know why?
175,"00:12:11,160","00:12:13,620",Because I am one million percent muscle.
176,"00:12:14,040","00:12:14,840","Yes, good."
177,"00:12:15,080","00:12:15,780",You've been listening.
178,"00:12:16,600","00:12:17,860",We're over the drop zone.
179,"00:12:18,360","00:12:19,140","All right, here we go."
180,"00:12:19,140","00:12:20,200",Showtime.
181,"00:12:22,880","00:12:26,200","Now look, we don't know if it's Godzilla or Hello Kitty down there,"
182,"00:12:26,300","00:12:27,960","but as long as we stick together,"
183,"00:12:28,180","00:12:29,800",there is nothing we can't handle.
184,"00:12:30,260","00:12:31,400",Team Sonic on three.
185,"00:12:32,000","00:12:33,900","One, two, three."
186,"00:12:35,400","00:12:36,480",Team Knuckles.
187,"00:12:38,840","00:12:40,860",Talk about low-budget flights.
188,"00:12:41,020","00:12:42,180",No food or movies?
189,"00:12:42,580","00:12:43,460",We're out of here.
190,"00:12:49,140","00:12:50,360",We're out of here.
191,"00:13:07,400","00:13:09,000",What happened here?
192,"00:13:09,140","00:13:10,780",Looks like Dunn got their butts kicked.
193,"00:13:11,160","00:13:12,020",Keep your eyes open.
194,"00:13:12,360","00:13:13,220","Tails, anything?"
195,"00:13:13,620","00:13:16,080","Whoa, these energy readings are off the charts."
196,"00:13:16,080","00:13:18,400",Look out!
197,"00:13:21,780","00:13:24,300",One million percent.
198,"00:13:37,620","00:13:38,300",Wow.
199,"00:13:38,840","00:13:40,080",Are you guys seeing this?
200,"00:13:40,320","00:13:41,900",He looks just like you.
201,"00:13:42,040","00:13:42,560",Impossible.
202,"00:13:42,940","00:13:44,120",You're a colorful bunch.
203,"00:13:44,900","00:13:46,020","Um, excuse me."
204,"00:13:46,020","00:13:47,780",Why do you look like me?
205,"00:13:48,040","00:13:49,460",I don't look like you.
206,"00:13:49,680","00:13:50,880",You look like me.
207,"00:13:51,280","00:13:52,600",Why do you look like me?
208,"00:13:52,820","00:13:53,540","Hey, you know what?"
209,"00:13:53,600","00:13:56,060","I'll ask the questions, new hedgehog."
210,"00:13:56,480","00:13:57,200",Who are you?
211,"00:13:57,540","00:13:58,500",Why do you look like me?
212,"00:13:58,640","00:14:00,140",This is a waste of time.
213,"00:14:00,700","00:14:03,140",Walk away before you get hurt.
214,"00:14:03,340","00:14:04,900","Whoa, whoa, easy, buddy."
215,"00:14:06,120","00:14:07,540",We don't want to fight you.
216,"00:14:07,960","00:14:09,980","Actually, Sonic, I would like to fight."
217,"00:14:10,820","00:14:11,480",Not now.
218,"00:14:11,700","00:14:14,120",Why don't you stop throwing cars at us for a second
219,"00:14:14,120","00:14:15,880",and come down here to talk?
220,"00:14:16,060","00:14:18,120",You jumped out of a gun helicopter.
221,"00:14:18,600","00:14:20,400",There's nothing to talk about.
222,"00:14:20,900","00:14:21,760","All right, then."
223,"00:14:22,100","00:14:22,500",Enough!
224,"00:14:22,800","00:14:23,420","Knuckles, no!"
225,"00:14:23,820","00:14:26,440",Let us talk with our fists!
226,"00:14:41,100","00:14:41,780",Knuckles!
227,"00:14:42,820","00:14:44,300","Knuckles, Knuckles, are you okay?"
228,"00:14:44,600","00:14:45,480","No, not really."
229,"00:14:48,120","00:14:49,840",Who is this guy?
230,"00:14:50,100","00:14:53,080",He is much more impressive than the hedgehog I fought previously.
231,"00:14:53,460","00:14:55,200","Dude, I'm standing right here."
232,"00:14:55,660","00:14:56,300","Now, come on."
233,"00:14:56,460","00:14:58,100",You can't take us all at once.
234,"00:15:04,900","00:15:10,660","Okay, he took us all at once."
235,"00:15:11,460","00:15:12,040",Weakling.
236,"00:15:15,980","00:15:17,920",Don't try to follow me.
237,"00:15:21,340","00:15:23,340","Sonic, I know that look."
238,"00:15:23,800","00:15:25,460",Going after him is a bad idea.
239,"00:15:25,920","00:15:27,080",When does that ever stop?
240,"00:15:31,360","00:15:33,380",I gotta ask one hedgehog to another.
241,"00:15:33,780","00:15:34,860",Who does your highlights?
242,"00:15:43,180","00:15:43,780",Hey!
243,"00:15:44,220","00:15:46,440",Dangerously weaving through traffic is my thing!
244,"00:15:53,380","00:16:01,430",I'm about to get started!
245,"00:16:02,850","00:16:06,670","The more you talk, the harder I want to hit you."
246,"00:16:09,970","00:16:10,930",Watch out!
247,"00:16:12,890","00:16:14,270",I'm gonna throw up.
248,"00:16:17,110","00:16:18,230","Whoa, whoa, whoa!"
249,"00:16:19,110","00:16:23,520",Yeah!
250,"00:17:01,820","00:17:02,780",21 gigawatts.
251,"00:17:02,780","00:17:07,930",Are you kidding me?
252,"00:17:08,470","00:17:08,950",Sonic!
253,"00:17:09,350","00:17:10,290",Are you okay?
254,"00:17:10,810","00:17:11,650","I'm fine, guys."
255,"00:17:11,790","00:17:16,150","And before you ask, I handcuffed myself for tactical reasons that I do not have time to explain."
256,"00:17:16,570","00:17:18,210",You shouldn't have gone off on your own.
257,"00:17:18,530","00:17:19,890",We're supposed to be a team.
258,"00:17:20,130","00:17:20,870","Sorry, buddy."
259,"00:17:21,070","00:17:22,630",I'm still working on this teamwork thing.
260,"00:17:23,230","00:17:24,110",So now what?
261,"00:17:24,370","00:17:28,330","Well, I'm not jumping out of any more helicopters until we get some answers from GUN."
262,"00:17:28,830","00:17:30,170",We need somewhere to regroup.
263,"00:17:31,690","00:17:33,490",I know just the place.
264,"00:17:45,790","00:17:46,849",It's an ambush!
265,"00:17:47,210","00:17:49,270","You'll never take us alive, foul beast!"
266,"00:17:49,490","00:17:50,430","Calm down, Knuckles."
267,"00:17:50,810","00:17:54,849","This is the Chao Garden, one of the top ten must-see spots in all of Tokyo."
268,"00:17:55,150","00:17:57,010",It's a perfect place for us to blend in.
269,"00:17:57,430","00:17:58,810",Are you Detective Pikachu?
270,"00:17:59,250","00:18:00,670","Yes, he is!"
271,"00:18:01,270","00:18:03,050",He does look like a PokÃ©mon.
272,"00:18:03,050","00:18:04,570",Pika Pika!
273,"00:18:05,010","00:18:06,190",Commander Walters!
274,"00:18:06,810","00:18:07,210",Sonic.
275,"00:18:08,390","00:18:09,890",Thank God you're all okay.
276,"00:18:10,350","00:18:11,410",I'm sure you have questions.
277,"00:18:11,770","00:18:14,130","Just a big, ticked-off, red-and-black one?"
278,"00:18:14,410","00:18:15,570",Who was that guy?
279,"00:18:15,890","00:18:18,350","Shadow's story began a lot like yours, Sonic."
280,"00:18:19,030","00:18:21,490","But where you found family and friends on this planet,"
281,"00:18:22,390","00:18:25,050",Shadow found only pain and loss.
282,"00:18:25,910","00:18:27,770","It begins over fifty years ago,"
283,"00:18:28,050","00:18:31,210",with a meteor crash in a quiet corner of Oklahoma.
284,"00:18:32,210","00:18:35,450",The meteorite contained a life form.
285,"00:18:37,970","00:18:39,570",The ultimate life form.
286,"00:18:41,570","00:18:44,430","Shadow's power, his Chaos Energy,"
287,"00:18:45,050","00:18:47,150",went far beyond any living creature.
288,"00:18:49,250","00:18:52,490",To discover and believe this power
289,"00:18:52,490","00:18:54,390",would usher in a new era for humanity.
290,"00:18:58,490","00:18:58,770",Dangerous.
291,"00:18:59,690","00:19:04,360","A terrible accident destroyed the lab,"
292,"00:19:04,700","00:19:06,060",taking human lives with it.
293,"00:19:06,840","00:19:09,380",The project leader was blamed for the incident
294,"00:19:09,380","00:19:10,040",and imprisoned.
295,"00:19:11,420","00:19:12,300","With the program cancelled,"
296,"00:19:13,100","00:19:14,280",Shadow was a loose end
297,"00:19:14,280","00:19:16,040",no one knew how to deal with.
298,"00:19:17,300","00:19:19,020",Too dangerous to be walking free.
299,"00:19:19,560","00:19:20,880",Too valuable to destroy.
300,"00:19:22,560","00:19:24,540",So I had him placed into stasis.
301,"00:19:28,120","00:19:28,640",Indefinitely.
302,"00:19:31,570","00:19:32,050",Wait a second.
303,"00:19:32,270","00:19:34,490","If Shadow's been on ice for fifty years,"
304,"00:19:34,750","00:19:36,150",someone had to help him escape.
305,"00:19:36,150","00:19:37,070",True.
306,"00:19:37,350","00:19:38,930",But there's only a few people in the world
307,"00:19:38,930","00:19:40,710",who even know of Shadow's existence.
308,"00:19:56,670","00:19:58,190",Oh my God!
309,"00:20:08,150","00:20:09,390",Get down!
310,"00:20:23,790","00:20:25,010",Egg drones?
311,"00:20:25,450","00:20:27,570",But Robotnik is supposed to be dead.
312,"00:20:39,570","00:20:40,210",Konichiwa!
313,"00:21:01,550","00:21:02,530",I'm sorry.
314,"00:21:02,710","00:21:05,210",We already had our big motorcycle chase for the evening.
315,"00:21:09,970","00:21:10,990",Commander Walters.
316,"00:21:12,450","00:21:14,370","Commander Walters, are you okay?"
317,"00:21:15,930","00:21:16,510",Sonic.
318,"00:21:19,540","00:21:20,460",Take this.
319,"00:21:21,180","00:21:21,740",What is it?
320,"00:21:22,200","00:21:22,720",A key.
321,"00:21:24,000","00:21:26,440",To the most powerful weapon God has ever built.
322,"00:21:27,120","00:21:29,080",You're the only one I trust to keep it safe.
323,"00:21:31,260","00:21:32,360",Commander Walters.
324,"00:21:45,680","00:21:47,100","Commander, secure the perimeter."
325,"00:21:50,470","00:21:51,410",Commander Vak is on Earth.
326,"00:21:55,680","00:21:56,940",His launch key is missing.
327,"00:22:04,060","00:22:05,740",I knew they couldn't be trusted.
328,"00:22:10,160","00:22:11,720",Why are we running from God?
329,"00:22:11,980","00:22:13,500",Aren't we on the same team?
330,"00:22:13,680","00:22:14,940","Until we get more information,"
331,"00:22:15,160","00:22:16,640",we're not trusting anyone.
332,"00:22:16,920","00:22:17,440",Follow me.
333,"00:22:35,880","00:22:37,760","Hold it right there, Tokyo Drift."
334,"00:22:38,080","00:22:39,500",Who are you?
335,"00:22:43,140","00:22:44,680",It's the goat milker.
336,"00:22:45,280","00:22:46,580",It's the goat milker.
337,"00:22:47,280","00:22:47,780",Relax.
338,"00:22:48,380","00:22:49,240",I'm not here to fight.
339,"00:22:49,540","00:22:51,060",Then why are you here?
340,"00:22:51,140","00:22:52,820",And why did you free Shadow?
341,"00:22:53,060","00:22:53,560",Are you kidding?
342,"00:22:54,340","00:22:56,700",The last thing we want is more super-powered hedgehogs.
343,"00:22:56,700","00:22:57,600",There are too many hedgehogs running around.
344,"00:22:58,580","00:23:00,120",The doctor had nothing to do with it.
345,"00:23:01,880","00:23:03,080",And I can prove it.
346,"00:23:19,050","00:23:19,570",Please.
347,"00:23:20,770","00:23:21,730",Join me in the crib.
348,"00:23:23,370","00:23:26,170",And now back to la ultima passion.
349,"00:23:26,870","00:23:28,470",I have fallen in love with another.
350,"00:23:30,570","00:23:31,790","But who, Gabriela?"
351,"00:23:32,070","00:23:32,650",Tell me.
352,"00:23:33,290","00:23:33,650",Who?
353,"00:23:35,450","00:23:37,710","My twin brother, Pablo?"
354,"00:23:42,590","00:23:43,410",Bastardo!
355,"00:23:43,890","00:23:46,430","Buenos dias, hermano."
356,"00:23:46,450","00:23:46,830",No!
357,"00:23:50,060","00:23:52,290","Let that be a lesson to you, Juan."
358,"00:23:53,010","00:23:56,890",Family is a field of emotional claymores
359,"00:23:56,890","00:23:58,530","that leave you abandoned,"
360,"00:23:59,150","00:23:59,570","betrayed,"
361,"00:24:00,290","00:24:03,430","and weeping while you eat cake,"
362,"00:24:04,150","00:24:06,450",which creates copious amounts of adipose tissue
363,"00:24:06,450","00:24:09,790",in what some calloused individuals refer to as
364,"00:24:10,830","00:24:12,170",man boobs.
365,"00:24:32,150","00:24:33,650","Doctor, we have visitors."
366,"00:24:35,390","00:24:35,910",Really?
367,"00:24:37,030","00:24:39,550",I thought I was having an anthropomorphic nightmare
368,"00:24:39,550","00:24:41,950",where the only person I could trust in the world
369,"00:24:41,950","00:24:43,510",showed up with all my worst enemies
370,"00:24:43,510","00:24:44,910",while I was in a bathroom
371,"00:24:44,910","00:24:47,170","playing congas on my big, fat belly."
372,"00:24:48,030","00:24:48,610","Sorry, sir."
373,"00:24:48,930","00:24:49,950",I don't believe it.
374,"00:24:50,230","00:24:51,370",Eggman's alive.
375,"00:24:51,510","00:24:53,910",And he's never looked worse.
376,"00:24:54,210","00:24:58,170","Well, maybe this is what not giving a damn"
377,"00:24:58,170","00:25:00,130",what you think I look like looks like.
378,"00:25:00,330","00:25:03,590","Sir, right now we have an even bigger problem."
379,"00:25:04,010","00:25:05,110","Oh, come on."
380,"00:25:06,830","00:25:09,550",There's an imposter out there using your technology.
381,"00:25:10,170","00:25:10,890",Imposter?
382,"00:25:11,070","00:25:12,070",That's impasa?
383,"00:25:12,410","00:25:12,870",What?
384,"00:25:13,590","00:25:14,130",No.
385,"00:25:14,730","00:25:18,450","My sweet, mechanized spawn."
386,"00:25:19,450","00:25:22,630",Whoever this party-pooping posse is looking for
387,"00:25:22,630","00:25:24,390",has stolen my persona
388,"00:25:24,390","00:25:28,210",and the precious babies from my egg sack.
389,"00:25:28,710","00:25:34,650","Well, I'll soon egg sack my revenge."
390,"00:25:35,510","00:25:36,410",You see what I did there?
391,"00:25:36,870","00:25:39,950",It's time for the dramatic soap opera twist
392,"00:25:39,950","00:25:43,530",where this Pablo reveals his wand.
393,"00:25:44,930","00:25:48,130",I cross-reference the precise coordinates
394,"00:25:48,130","00:25:51,310",of each drone's energy spikes.
395,"00:25:52,050","00:25:53,810",I can track my babies
396,"00:25:53,810","00:25:56,670",to the imposter's base of operations
397,"00:25:57,910","00:25:59,630",right about there.
398,"00:26:00,150","00:26:01,770","Sonic, I hate to say it,"
399,"00:26:01,810","00:26:03,850",but I think we're both after the same person.
400,"00:26:04,010","00:26:04,650","Hold on, hold on."
401,"00:26:04,870","00:26:08,650","You're not suggesting we team up with Dr. Robotstink, are you?"
402,"00:26:08,990","00:26:10,310",Perhaps the fox is right.
403,"00:26:10,570","00:26:13,290","It could be our only chance to find this mysterious,"
404,"00:26:13,670","00:26:14,950",more impressive hedgehog.
405,"00:26:15,410","00:26:15,890",Ugh.
406,"00:26:16,370","00:26:17,330","All right, Egghead."
407,"00:26:17,630","00:26:20,190","I hate to say it, but it looks like we're partners."
408,"00:26:21,150","00:26:23,050",On one condition.
409,"00:26:24,870","00:26:27,230","Dude, you have serious issues."
410,"00:26:31,850","00:26:35,350",Let's do this!
411,"00:26:35,350","00:26:35,590",Shit!
412,"00:26:44,020","00:26:44,430",No!
413,"00:26:46,950","00:26:48,370","I'm the troublemaker,"
414,"00:26:48,950","00:26:50,330",the killing skater!
415,"00:26:54,080","00:26:55,510","I'm the hand-kissing,"
416,"00:26:55,710","00:26:56,990",and I kill in a second!
417,"00:27:05,010","00:27:07,550","Tinkertailer, I need room."
418,"00:27:08,390","00:27:10,210","Think Elvis, circa 1976."
419,"00:27:11,110","00:27:12,930","Sir, I don't have the proper materials."
420,"00:27:14,370","00:27:14,830",Pantom!
421,"00:27:18,030","00:27:18,950",Resourceful.
422,"00:28:00,150","00:28:01,790","Hey, this is a restricted area."
423,"00:28:01,930","00:28:02,250","No, it's okay."
424,"00:28:02,390","00:28:03,830",She's the professor's granddaughter.
425,"00:28:04,450","00:28:05,550",He takes her everywhere.
426,"00:28:06,670","00:28:07,990","Welcome to the lab, Maria."
427,"00:28:08,370","00:28:09,490",I'm Captain Walters.
428,"00:28:10,050","00:28:11,150","Oh, do you know where my room is?"
429,"00:28:11,330","00:28:12,630","Yeah, down the hall to the right."
430,"00:28:13,130","00:28:13,830",Make yourself at home.
431,"00:28:14,630","00:28:16,930","But, um, let's lose the skates."
432,"00:28:17,250","00:28:17,790","Okay, get out."
433,"00:28:18,230","00:28:18,550",Okay.
434,"00:28:32,470","00:30:02,800","Well, it's all right"
435,"00:30:02,800","00:30:05,680",Riding around in the breeze
436,"00:30:05,680","00:30:08,380","Well, it's all right"
437,"00:30:10,900","00:30:14,220","Well, it's all right"
438,"00:30:14,220","00:30:16,920",Doing the best you can
439,"00:30:16,920","00:30:19,120","Well, it's all right"
440,"00:30:19,940","00:30:22,600",As long as you lend a hand
441,"00:30:30,520","00:30:34,420",You'll think of me and wonder where I am these days
442,"00:30:36,300","00:30:40,620",Maybe somewhere down the road in somebody's place
443,"00:30:44,280","00:30:46,620","Well, it's all right"
444,"00:30:47,400","00:30:49,720",Even when push comes to shove
445,"00:30:49,720","00:30:52,260","Well, it's all right"
446,"00:30:53,540","00:30:55,440",Everybody's got something to love
447,"00:30:55,440","00:30:57,960","Well, it's all right"
448,"00:30:59,800","00:31:01,180",Everybody's got something to love
449,"00:31:01,180","00:31:03,720","Well, it's all right"
450,"00:31:04,340","00:31:22,280",I'm going to the end of the line
451,"00:31:22,280","00:31:25,620","Wow, look at all those stars"
452,"00:31:25,620","00:31:28,660",They're like diamonds
453,"00:31:30,610","00:31:36,470",My grandfather says it can take hundreds of years for the light of a star to reach Earth
454,"00:31:37,290","00:31:41,290","And by the time we see it, the star might not even exist anymore"
455,"00:31:43,050","00:31:44,010",Isn't that crazy?
456,"00:31:44,010","00:31:44,110",What do you mean?
457,"00:31:46,200","00:31:50,140","The light shines, even though the star is gone"
458,"00:31:51,400","00:31:53,040","Yeah, it does"
459,"00:31:54,610","00:31:56,750","I wonder which one you came from, Shadow"
460,"00:31:56,750","00:31:58,010",I don't know
461,"00:31:58,750","00:32:01,070",I don't know anything about my home
462,"00:32:02,010","00:32:04,030","This is your home, Shadow"
463,"00:32:04,810","00:32:05,370",All right
464,"00:32:12,770","00:32:17,950","Maria, do you think I'm dangerous?"
465,"00:32:19,550","00:32:20,890",What are you talking about?
466,"00:32:20,890","00:32:25,950","The way the scientists look at me, I can tell they're afraid"
467,"00:32:26,610","00:32:29,790",Like I'm the horrible thing from that movie we watched
468,"00:32:30,590","00:32:34,010",I don't know what I am
469,"00:32:39,220","00:32:40,640",You're my friend
470,"00:32:42,280","00:32:45,140",And you can do or be anything you want
471,"00:32:46,200","00:32:51,660","Not because of your powers, but because of who you are in here"
472,"00:32:51,660","00:32:56,470",I don't know what I'd do without you
473,"00:33:38,280","00:33:38,760",Professor?
474,"00:33:40,100","00:33:41,820","It's good to see you, Shadow"
475,"00:33:45,390","00:33:47,450",I can't get her out of my head
476,"00:33:47,450","00:33:50,870","The pain, it's too much"
477,"00:33:51,570","00:33:54,390",And that is why we have to punish them
478,"00:33:59,090","00:34:02,270","Okay, I don't like you and you don't like me, let's get this over with quickly"
479,"00:34:02,270","00:34:04,810","Out of my way, dorkupine"
480,"00:34:04,810","00:34:06,530",Dorkupine? Really clever
481,"00:34:13,080","00:34:16,920",This door is six inch thick solid steel and a pressurized latch
482,"00:34:16,920","00:34:21,600",I'll need a moment to calculate the molecular density and invert the venting mechanics
483,"00:34:24,760","00:34:26,080",I unlocked it
484,"00:34:26,080","00:34:29,260","Subtle as always, fist for brains"
485,"00:34:31,020","00:34:32,160","Easy, Shadow"
486,"00:34:32,160","00:34:34,560",Those are the guests I've been expecting
487,"00:34:35,220","00:34:37,240",Let's give them a warm welcome
488,"00:34:42,860","00:34:44,460",What is this place?
489,"00:34:44,960","00:34:48,180","Looks like a military base, but nobody's been here for years"
490,"00:34:48,180","00:34:49,720",I wonder if it's haunted
491,"00:34:49,720","00:34:52,980",Haunted? Nobody said anything about being haunted
492,"00:34:52,980","00:34:56,440",What's the matter? You afraid of g-g-ghosts?
493,"00:34:56,560","00:34:58,520",Nothing scares an echidna warrior
494,"00:34:58,520","00:35:00,980","Uh, yeah, do you remember what happened last movie night?"
495,"00:35:05,960","00:35:08,040",There's no such thing as a friendly ghost
496,"00:35:09,900","00:35:11,360","So, which way do we go?"
497,"00:35:12,380","00:35:14,860","I know, we should split up"
498,"00:35:15,520","00:35:20,240","Everyone with hideous brightly colored fur take the left in the middle, Stone and I will go right"
499,"00:35:20,240","00:35:22,580","No, no, no, no, no, I'm not letting you out of my sight"
500,"00:35:22,580","00:35:24,380","Tails, you and Stone go left"
501,"00:35:24,380","00:35:25,680","Knuckles, you take the middle"
502,"00:35:25,680","00:35:27,560","Eggman, you and me go right"
503,"00:35:27,560","00:35:28,800",By all means
504,"00:35:29,320","00:35:32,460",We could use some time together to work on your trust issues
505,"00:35:32,460","00:35:34,280",You know what? You're right
506,"00:35:34,280","00:35:35,800",I should be more trusting
507,"00:35:35,800","00:35:38,540","I mean, you've only tried to kill me twice"
508,"00:35:40,380","00:35:42,540","Just a dark, creepy hallway"
509,"00:35:42,540","00:35:44,820",Nothing to be afraid of
510,"00:35:45,980","00:35:47,180","You hear that, ghosts?"
511,"00:35:48,400","00:35:49,800",You don't frighten me
512,"00:35:54,400","00:35:56,320",Get a grip
513,"00:36:01,380","00:36:03,560",I'm just gonna come right out and say this
514,"00:36:04,440","00:36:05,420",You're adorable
515,"00:36:06,560","00:36:07,040",Thanks
516,"00:36:07,040","00:36:09,760","So, what's it like being Sonic's assistant?"
517,"00:36:10,600","00:36:11,880",You have a daily routine?
518,"00:36:12,580","00:36:14,120",Paid time off? Benefits?
519,"00:36:14,520","00:36:16,160","Oh, I'm not Sonic's assistant"
520,"00:36:16,160","00:36:17,280",We're teammates
521,"00:36:17,280","00:36:18,380",He's the leader
522,"00:36:18,380","00:36:19,520",Knuckles is the muscle
523,"00:36:19,520","00:36:20,980",And I'm the gadget guy
524,"00:36:20,980","00:36:22,620",We all have a role to play
525,"00:36:22,620","00:36:24,360",That's what makes the team so special
526,"00:36:24,360","00:36:26,200",That and the fact we're best friends
527,"00:36:27,260","00:36:28,020",You are
528,"00:36:28,020","00:36:30,260","Well, yeah, just like you and Eggman, right?"
529,"00:36:31,740","00:36:33,220","Uh, yeah"
530,"00:36:33,220","00:36:35,780","Of course, yes"
531,"00:36:35,780","00:36:37,680",Me and the doctor
532,"00:36:37,680","00:36:39,080",Best of friends
533,"00:36:40,440","00:36:42,420",That's definitely what we are
534,"00:37:08,110","00:37:10,010",Look at all this stuff
535,"00:37:10,010","00:37:13,730",This was more than just a military base or lab
536,"00:37:13,730","00:37:15,710",It was a home
537,"00:37:15,710","00:37:17,250",People lived here
538,"00:37:18,090","00:37:19,370",He had a family
539,"00:37:20,090","00:37:21,650",Is that what I smell?
540,"00:37:22,150","00:37:24,490",A stench of domestic harmony?
541,"00:37:25,410","00:37:28,630",You ever wonder what your life would have been like if you had a family?
542,"00:37:29,090","00:37:30,570","Hmm, no"
543,"00:37:30,570","00:37:32,730",Maybe you wouldn't have gone full supervillain
544,"00:37:32,730","00:37:35,450","I have no parents, no aunts, no uncles"
545,"00:37:35,450","00:37:38,210",And something about my attitude renders me
546,"00:37:40,070","00:37:42,710",Undesirable to all possible genders
547,"00:37:44,910","00:37:46,610",My future is a contact
548,"00:37:47,810","00:37:49,890",The robotic name ends
549,"00:37:51,630","00:37:52,550",Avec moi
550,"00:37:53,530","00:37:55,090","Yes, I know French"
551,"00:37:59,810","00:38:00,410",Whoa
552,"00:38:01,570","00:38:03,370","Is this where you grew up, Shadow?"
553,"00:38:04,530","00:38:05,950",No wonder you're so mad
554,"00:38:06,730","00:38:10,150",This place could really use a beanbag chair and some comic books
555,"00:38:11,630","00:38:12,950",What happened here?
556,"00:38:15,590","00:38:17,370",I'm tired of giving you warnings
557,"00:38:20,650","00:38:22,330","Where'd you go, hedgehog?"
558,"00:38:22,630","00:38:24,130",I wasn't finished trauma dumping
559,"00:38:27,270","00:38:28,870",My darlings
560,"00:38:30,590","00:38:33,230",My hanging weddings
561,"00:38:35,770","00:38:36,570",Memories
562,"00:38:37,450","00:38:44,650",Lie the corners of my mind
563,"00:38:44,650","00:38:50,930",Misty watercolor memories
564,"00:38:53,510","00:39:01,130",Of the way we went
565,"00:39:02,510","00:39:06,720",I don't believe it
566,"00:39:06,720","00:39:07,400",Don't you?
567,"00:39:07,580","00:39:08,400",It's impossible
568,"00:39:08,400","00:39:08,740",Is it?
569,"00:39:08,940","00:39:09,460",It couldn't be
570,"00:39:09,460","00:39:10,520",Are you?
571,"00:39:10,760","00:39:11,360",Imposter!
572,"00:39:12,080","00:39:14,140",You stole my babies
573,"00:39:14,140","00:39:17,080",They know who their real daddy is
574,"00:39:17,080","00:39:18,560",Drone Napper?
575,"00:39:20,780","00:39:23,040","Magnificent creations, my boy"
576,"00:39:23,040","00:39:26,100",I borrowed them to lure you here
577,"00:39:26,100","00:39:28,100",And reunite our family
578,"00:39:29,540","00:39:31,220",Is he I owe?
579,"00:39:33,900","00:39:35,760",I'm your grandfather
580,"00:39:36,340","00:39:38,980",Gerald Robotnik
581,"00:39:43,250","00:39:45,490",My grandfather?
582,"00:39:49,360","00:39:50,180",And why?
583,"00:39:50,180","00:39:52,600",And who did what with whom?
584,"00:39:53,380","00:39:57,580",You hail from an ancestry of excellence
585,"00:39:57,580","00:40:00,020",Tied directly a moi
586,"00:40:00,020","00:40:03,580","Yes, I know French"
587,"00:40:03,580","00:40:08,050",You do look like me
588,"00:40:08,050","00:40:10,470",But fatter and older
589,"00:40:10,470","00:40:13,070",And there's that funny smell
590,"00:40:14,410","00:40:17,610",But the resemblance is uncanny
591,"00:40:17,610","00:40:19,570",It's as if
592,"00:40:20,170","00:40:22,530",We were two characters in a movie
593,"00:40:22,530","00:40:24,890",Being played by the same actor
594,"00:40:25,490","00:40:27,230",But I need real proof
595,"00:40:27,230","00:40:27,810",I will
596,"00:40:27,810","00:40:29,270",We have very little time
597,"00:40:29,270","00:40:32,810",But I could field a couple of queries
598,"00:40:33,550","00:40:36,250",Name the most elegant formula in mathematics
599,"00:40:36,250","00:40:37,570",Euler's identity
600,"00:40:37,570","00:40:40,210",e to the i times pi plus one equals zilch
601,"00:40:40,210","00:40:42,930",European capitals arranged alphabetically by the fourth letter
602,"00:40:43,490","00:40:45,430","Riga, Monaco, Sarajevo, Toronto"

715,"00:48:50,930","00:48:51,470",Yay!
716,"00:48:52,050","00:48:55,630",It's really been great having time to ourselves

729,"00:49:28,150","00:49:30,530",Really? You're in? Just like that?
730,"00:49:30,530","00:49:33,530","Yes, it was getting so boring without you guys here"
731,"00:49:33,530","00:49:35,210","So, boring, no, not taken"
732,"00:49:35,210","00:49:37,750","I mean, whatever crazy plan you're cooking up, the answer's yes"
733,"00:49:38,370","00:49:41,210","Great, but first things first, what is that?"
734,"00:49:41,670","00:49:43,670","Oh, this is..."
735,"00:49:43,670","00:49:44,450",Little Tom!
736,"00:49:44,870","00:49:45,390",It'd be great
737,"00:49:47,340","00:49:49,640","I told you to get rid of that, it's very creepy"
738,"00:49:49,640","00:49:51,220",That's all there is to get rid of you
739,"00:49:51,220","00:49:53,200","Okay, let's cross it off"
740,"00:49:53,200","00:49:54,320",You are in so much trouble
741,"00:49:57,280","00:50:01,720","Okay, this is it, the belly of the beast, gun headquarters in London"
742,"00:50:02,540","00:50:05,380","Tom, we're finally gonna get to see London together"
743,"00:50:05,380","00:50:07,360","Hey, I told you we'd get there someday, baby"
744,"00:50:07,360","00:50:11,400","Okay, so here's the plan, I run in super fast"
745,"00:50:11,400","00:50:16,160","Right over that water, no problem, then right when I get to the..."
746,"00:50:16,160","00:50:17,740",What just happened?
747,"00:50:18,360","00:50:21,500","Congratulations, you just got incinerated by their energy shield"
748,"00:50:21,500","00:50:25,240",We'll need to shut it down by planting a USB drive in their server room
749,"00:50:25,240","00:50:27,140",That will give me full control over it
750,"00:50:27,680","00:50:29,660",That's what we need you two for
751,"00:50:29,660","00:50:31,320","We're badass spies, that's what we are"
752,"00:50:31,320","00:50:32,320",Mr. and Mrs. Smith
753,"00:50:32,940","00:50:36,700","Once we disable the shield, you'll face the laser haul"
754,"00:50:38,020","00:50:41,440",These high-density bad boys will cut you into tiny pieces
755,"00:50:42,740","00:50:45,720",And cut those pieces into even tinier pieces
756,"00:50:45,720","00:50:46,760",Once again?
757,"00:50:47,620","00:50:49,680",Can't we just get Tom Cruise to do this?
758,"00:50:49,680","00:50:53,640","Nope, because not even he could break into the vault"
759,"00:50:53,640","00:50:55,360",Why is it empty in there?
760,"00:50:55,500","00:50:58,220",Because we have no idea what's on the other side of that door
761,"00:50:58,220","00:51:00,960",To prevent the vault from ever being accessed by a ring
762,"00:51:00,960","00:51:03,960",All images and schematics have been wiped from GUN's database
763,"00:51:03,960","00:51:09,140","So for the last leg of this heist, we're going in blind"
764,"00:51:15,500","00:51:19,400","Okay, I'm just gonna say it, it sounds like this plan will work a heck of a lot better"
765,"00:51:19,400","00:51:24,080",If Sonic used the Master Emerald to go golden god mode to get the key
766,"00:51:25,200","00:51:26,260","No way, Maddy"
767,"00:51:26,260","00:51:29,040",The Master Emerald is too powerful to ever use again
768,"00:51:29,040","00:51:31,620",We made a promise to each other to keep it hidden
769,"00:51:31,620","00:51:33,940",In a location only Knuckles knows
770,"00:51:33,940","00:51:36,000",As guardian of the Master Emerald
771,"00:51:36,000","00:51:39,180",Anyone who tries to take it away for any reason
772,"00:51:39,180","00:51:41,060",Will become a sworn enemy
773,"00:51:41,680","00:51:43,260","Okay, okay, sheesh"
774,"00:51:43,260","00:51:45,160","No need to get all growly on me, buddy"
775,"00:51:45,160","00:51:48,040",You guys are always telling us to make good choices
776,"00:51:48,040","00:51:50,220","Well, this is the right choice"
777,"00:51:50,220","00:51:54,220","Okay, I guess we're going to"
778,"00:52:14,830","00:52:17,350",GUN headquarters is right there
779,"00:52:17,350","00:52:21,590","Let me go in, get the key, and destroy anyone in my way"
780,"00:52:21,590","00:52:23,130",I want revenge
781,"00:52:23,130","00:52:24,490","Patience, Shadow"
782,"00:52:24,490","00:52:26,930",Just let us handle this
783,"00:52:27,670","00:52:29,190",And I promise
784,"00:52:29,190","00:52:31,250",You'll have revenge
785,"00:52:31,250","00:52:35,070",On a scale you couldn't possibly imagine
786,"00:52:35,070","00:52:36,970","Come on, granddaddy-o"
787,"00:52:36,970","00:52:39,690",We've got dirt to do
788,"00:52:40,410","00:52:41,130",Suits
789,"00:52:41,130","00:52:42,670","Right here, sir"
790,"00:52:43,610","00:52:45,730","Stone, babysit the hedgehog"
791,"00:52:45,730","00:52:47,510",Keep the crab on a low boil
792,"00:52:49,110","00:52:51,350",It's time for more family bonding
793,"00:52:56,190","00:52:57,150","Come on, Shadow"
794,"00:52:58,150","00:52:59,990",Got fresh avocados in the crab
795,"00:52:59,990","00:53:01,370",We'll make guac
796,"00:53:04,090","00:53:05,130",Revenge guac
797,"00:53:13,370","00:53:15,270","Guys, are you ready for me yet?"
798,"00:53:15,270","00:53:17,270",I've been waiting here all day
799,"00:53:20,170","00:53:22,730","Sonic, we literally just started"
800,"00:53:22,730","00:53:25,230","Tom, Maddy, are you in position and ready?"
801,"00:53:25,850","00:53:26,710",We were born ready
802,"00:53:26,710","00:53:27,590",Let's do this
803,"00:53:27,590","00:53:28,910","Knuckles, how about you?"
804,"00:53:29,110","00:53:31,290",I have taken my perch atop the giant clock
805,"00:53:31,290","00:53:34,090","Now, where is this glass I'm supposed to break?"
806,"00:53:34,430","00:53:38,130","Actually, Knuckles, your job is to break glass in case of emergency"
807,"00:53:38,130","00:53:39,050",Understood
808,"00:53:39,050","00:53:43,430",I will shatter this glass like the jaw of a vile foe
809,"00:53:43,430","00:53:45,030",In case of emergency
810,"00:53:45,030","00:53:48,050",I will pulverize it like the skull of a loathsome vile
811,"00:53:48,050","00:53:51,410","Just to be clear, the emergency is the important part"
812,"00:53:51,410","00:53:55,810",The glass will beg for mercy under the shadow of my mighty fist
813,"00:53:55,810","00:53:57,150","Guys, remember, we're a team"
814,"00:53:57,150","00:53:57,910","Now, let's focus"
815,"00:53:58,250","00:53:58,490",Please
816,"00:53:58,490","00:53:59,990",You know what? Let's move on
817,"00:53:59,990","00:54:01,930","All right, everyone knows what to do"
818,"00:54:01,930","00:54:04,150","Tom and Maddy, you guys plant the USB drive"
819,"00:54:04,150","00:54:05,350",I'll disable the traps
820,"00:54:05,350","00:54:06,910",Sonic will snag the launch key
821,"00:54:06,910","00:54:09,110","And, Knuckles, you stand by to..."
822,"00:54:09,110","00:54:11,050",Break glass in case of emergency
823,"00:54:11,050","00:54:12,830",See? He gets it
824,"00:54:12,830","00:54:13,970",Then we're all set
825,"00:54:14,730","00:54:15,470",Hologram time
826,"00:54:17,360","00:54:18,280",You go first
827,"00:54:20,380","00:54:22,040","Tom, it's me, Rachel"
828,"00:54:22,040","00:54:24,080",Can you believe it? We're both in London together
829,"00:54:24,080","00:54:25,940",Have you met your sister? Try again
830,"00:54:27,020","00:54:28,800",Unless you're not up for this mission
831,"00:54:29,220","00:54:31,540","Yeah, maybe when you'll be back in Green Hills baking sourdough"
832,"00:54:31,540","00:54:32,920",Thomas Michael Wachowski
833,"00:54:32,920","00:54:33,200",Yeah
834,"00:54:33,200","00:54:36,960","You brought aliens to my wedding, punched out my husband and buried me in an avalanche"
835,"00:54:36,960","00:54:39,220",Your day of reckoning is at hand
836,"00:54:39,220","00:54:40,180","Yeah, that's perfect"
837,"00:54:40,820","00:54:42,240","Okay, now for her better half"
838,"00:54:44,260","00:54:46,360","Oh, my name is Randall"
839,"00:54:46,360","00:54:48,620",And I have too much to handle
840,"00:54:49,300","00:54:51,080",Welcome to the gun show
841,"00:54:51,640","00:54:55,260","Baby, would you describe me as jacked, juiced, or shredded?"
842,"00:54:56,740","00:54:58,340",I would describe your head as swollen
843,"00:54:58,340","00:54:59,660",Let's get to work
844,"00:55:03,700","00:55:04,840","Agent Randall, Handle"
845,"00:55:05,500","00:55:07,780","I'm here to have lunch with my lovely wife, Rachel"
846,"00:55:07,780","00:55:09,380","I'm sorry, Agent Handle"
847,"00:55:09,380","00:55:11,440",This facility is currently locked down
848,"00:55:11,440","00:55:13,320","Come on, level clearance only"
849,"00:55:13,880","00:55:14,600",One minute
850,"00:55:16,920","00:55:18,860","Tails, we have a problem here"
851,"00:55:18,860","00:55:21,640","Wow, they must have tightened security after Shadow's escape"
852,"00:55:21,640","00:55:22,960",I got this
853,"00:55:24,220","00:55:25,740",You must be new here
854,"00:55:25,740","00:55:28,220","Allow me to introduce myself, my name is Rachel"
855,"00:55:28,220","00:55:30,340",Rachel gonna get you fired
856,"00:55:31,140","00:55:33,300",Do you know what the gun stands for?
857,"00:55:33,660","00:55:35,340","Of course, guardian unit"
858,"00:55:36,220","00:55:38,500",Getting ultra nasty
859,"00:55:38,500","00:55:43,060",Do you want me to get ultra nasty?
860,"00:55:43,840","00:55:45,140","Nasty, nasty"
861,"00:55:45,140","00:55:46,000","No, ma'am"
862,"00:55:46,000","00:55:46,740","Okay, then"
863,"00:55:47,080","00:55:50,460",Then go ahead and take those little sad fingers and start tippity-tap-tap-tap
864,"00:55:51,640","00:55:53,100","That's right, go on"
865,"00:55:54,160","00:55:56,060","Sorry for the inconvenience, ma'am"
866,"00:55:58,020","00:55:59,680",That's what I thought
867,"00:56:03,020","00:56:04,940","My God, I love being Rachel"
868,"00:56:15,220","00:56:15,960",Did it work?
869,"00:56:16,760","00:56:17,220",Yeah
870,"00:56:21,120","00:56:23,720","Director Rockwell, seeking access to the server room"
871,"00:56:23,720","00:56:25,600","Just one moment, ma'am"
872,"00:56:26,360","00:56:28,980","Oh no, it's her, it's her, it's the real her"
873,"00:56:30,380","00:56:33,120",What do we do?
874,"00:56:33,800","00:56:34,580","Quick, change faces"
875,"00:56:34,580","00:56:35,480","Okay, did it work?"
876,"00:56:36,060","00:56:36,540",What am I...
877,"00:56:37,120","00:56:37,880",What's going on?
878,"00:56:38,700","00:56:39,960",What am I doing wrong?
879,"00:56:39,960","00:56:40,160",Ow
880,"00:56:42,640","00:56:43,760","Aye-aye, captain"
881,"00:56:47,700","00:56:49,060","Aye-aye, captain"
882,"00:56:49,060","00:56:50,420",Who are you? What am I?
883,"00:56:50,700","00:56:51,480",I'm Anna Tushkin
884,"00:56:51,480","00:56:53,360","Gee, get it together"
885,"00:56:57,340","00:56:58,920","Okay, Tails, what are we looking for?"
886,"00:56:59,180","00:57:02,420","The security server is in the seventh row, 23rd cabinet"
887,"00:57:02,420","00:57:04,240",Are you guys finished yet?
888,"00:57:04,440","00:57:06,500",This is taking forever
889,"00:57:08,300","00:57:08,940",Uh-oh
890,"00:57:08,940","00:57:11,360",Has the time come to break the glass?
891,"00:57:11,360","00:57:12,980",Or at least break something
892,"00:57:12,980","00:57:15,420","All right, hang tight guys, Maddie's about to insert the drive"
893,"00:57:16,380","00:57:16,900",Ready?
894,"00:57:18,440","00:57:20,560","Three, two, one"
895,"00:57:22,560","00:57:23,080",Go
896,"00:57:27,670","00:57:28,690",It didn't work
897,"00:57:28,690","00:57:29,690",Can you put it in the right way?
898,"00:57:29,790","00:57:30,690",Try punching it
899,"00:57:30,690","00:57:32,570",Do not try punching it
900,"00:57:32,570","00:57:32,890",Ow
901,"00:57:32,890","00:57:34,530",Take it out and blow on it
902,"00:57:34,530","00:57:34,950",Yes
903,"00:57:35,850","00:57:36,970","Come on, Tom"
904,"00:57:37,630","00:57:42,390",There's absolutely no scientific evidence to support...
905,"00:57:42,910","00:57:44,550","Never mind, it worked"
906,"00:57:44,550","00:57:45,690",A little trick from the 90s
907,"00:57:45,690","00:57:47,790","I mean, best decade ever, right?"
908,"00:57:48,410","00:57:50,370",I'm shutting down the outside sensors now
909,"00:57:50,370","00:57:50,730",Yes
910,"00:57:50,730","00:57:53,210","Uh, hold on"
911,"00:57:53,210","00:57:55,950",Is there supposed to be another USB drive here?
912,"00:57:56,130","00:57:57,790",One with a giant mustache on it?
913,"00:57:58,610","00:57:59,610",Oh no
914,"00:57:59,610","00:58:02,150",I've got two heat signatures en route to the vault
915,"00:58:02,150","00:58:03,550",Which can only mean...
916,"00:58:09,370","00:58:12,570",Our robotics have entered the chat
917,"00:58:12,570","00:58:12,890",Wait
918,"00:58:14,710","00:58:15,510",Wait
919,"00:58:15,510","00:58:16,310",Poppyseed?
920,"00:58:17,750","00:58:19,270",Grand Geezer?
921,"00:58:20,190","00:58:21,030",Donde esta?
922,"00:58:21,410","00:58:22,550",I'm right here
923,"00:58:23,570","00:58:26,370","If you weren't family, I could have cut you like a peasant"
924,"00:58:27,330","00:58:29,850","I mean, try to keep up"
925,"00:58:33,210","00:58:36,250",And now back to la ultima passion
926,"00:58:36,250","00:58:41,250",Ultima passion can only belong to one
927,"00:58:41,250","00:58:42,030",No
928,"00:58:42,890","00:58:46,150",It can only belong to one
929,"00:58:47,350","00:58:49,070","Gabriella, she killed them both"
930,"00:58:49,070","00:58:51,690",She's not a prize to be won
931,"00:58:52,250","00:58:53,990","Kill this, murder that"
932,"00:58:53,990","00:58:55,970","You need to lighten up, Shadow"
933,"00:58:55,970","00:58:57,550",We're about to rule the world
934,"00:58:58,250","00:58:59,330",When we're done
935,"00:59:00,250","00:59:02,470",There won't be anything left to rule
936,"00:59:03,050","00:59:04,010",That is dark
937,"00:59:04,010","00:59:05,470",Even for you
938,"00:59:06,130","00:59:07,910",What are you and the professor up to?
939,"00:59:08,290","00:59:08,710",Hello
940,"00:59:09,250","00:59:10,410",What's this?
941,"00:59:10,410","00:59:12,790",I knew I saw an outside signal
942,"00:59:13,690","00:59:17,230","Mario, I guess someone forgot to flush"
943,"00:59:37,520","00:59:40,240","What now, my cunning cohort?"
944,"00:59:40,800","00:59:42,440",Just a little teamwork
945,"00:59:49,800","00:59:50,360",Hey
946,"00:59:51,560","00:59:52,420",The lasers
947,"00:59:54,080","00:59:56,220",Don't seem to be penetrating my suit
948,"00:59:58,020","01:00:01,360",They're conforming to the shape of my bodacious barred deck
949,"01:00:01,360","01:00:02,220",Of course
950,"01:00:02,220","01:00:08,440",I designed these suits to create a field of laser-bending thermal distortion
951,"01:00:08,440","01:00:10,380",Wasn't sure it would work till now
952,"01:00:11,020","01:00:12,540",You're a heartless son
953,"01:00:13,400","01:00:14,800",Rotten to the core
954,"01:00:14,800","01:00:17,500",I'm surprised
955,"01:00:17,500","01:00:19,980",So now we can just dance right through?
956,"01:00:22,560","01:00:24,340",That sounds like a challenge
957,"01:00:43,460","01:00:45,540","If you think about it, so many people do"
958,"01:00:45,540","01:00:46,980",Be cool and a little smarter
959,"01:00:48,120","01:00:49,500",And you shouldn't even care
960,"01:00:49,500","01:00:50,640",About those losers in the air
961,"01:00:50,640","01:00:51,560",And the crooked stare
962,"01:00:52,540","01:00:54,060",Cause there's a party over here
963,"01:00:54,060","01:00:55,240",So you might as well be here
964,"01:00:55,240","01:00:56,140",If people care
965,"01:00:57,440","01:00:58,460",We are all the
966,"01:00:58,460","01:00:58,980",Destroyer
967,"01:01:12,900","01:01:27,360","Hello, welcome to my lecture, I hope you're having a good time."
968,"01:01:27,360","01:01:56,740","Welcome to my lecture, I hope you're having a good time."
969,"01:01:56,740","01:02:02,000","Hear ye, hear ye. Sonic the Hedgehog wants a cup of tea. Hold this for me please."
970,"01:02:03,360","01:02:05,960",You're not gonna make it. I can make it.
971,"01:02:09,360","01:02:16,920",You're not gonna make it. I'm gonna make it. I'm not gonna make it. I'm not gonna make it.
972,"01:02:24,460","01:02:33,880",You're not gonna make it. You're not gonna make it. You're not gonna make it. You're not gonna make it.
973,"01:02:33,880","01:02:43,120","Our destiny awaits. Stop right there, robo scum. Let's do this."
974,"01:02:50,900","01:02:55,620","Too slow, Eggman. Now, if you don't mind, I've gotta get that key."
975,"01:02:57,280","01:03:04,620",Why can't I use my beautiful feet? Because this vault is armed with variable gravity.
976,"01:03:05,880","01:03:13,380","No kidding. Green goes up and red takes you down hard. Rockwell, listen to me. The Robotniks are"
977,"01:03:13,900","01:03:17,880","They're planning on stealing the second key, just like you are. Yes, I'm aware."
978,"01:03:19,400","01:03:26,220","I called it the second Commander Walters was attacked, so thank you for taking the bait"
979,"01:03:26,220","01:03:34,000","and falling right into my trap. I don't believe this. I know, grandson. A woman in the military."
980,"01:03:36,180","01:03:48,180","Let's go. Robotnik. You're going full spandex, huh? Who's the fossil? That's my grandfather,"
981,"01:03:48,460","01:03:55,140",you dough-eating dimwit civil. Who are they? A couple of bleeding hearts here to rescue their
982,"01:03:55,140","01:04:02,280",emotional support animals. Enough. It's over. The only way you're leaving here is in handcuffs.
983,"01:04:02,920","01:04:07,380","There is no other way out. You know, there might be one other way out."
984,"01:04:07,540","01:04:10,940","And what is that supposed to mean? Hey, big guy, I think it's time to"
985,"01:04:12,240","01:04:14,540",break class in case of emergency.
986,"01:04:23,040","01:04:26,800",Nothing can stop Team Knuckles. Open fire.
987,"01:04:26,800","01:04:31,060","God, Knuckles, turn this stuff off. Hurry. On it."
988,"01:04:32,840","01:04:33,580",Uh-oh.
989,"01:04:41,640","01:04:43,000",See how you like it.
990,"01:04:50,280","01:04:55,720","Can you move? No, not at all. Tails, can you? No, I'm stuck."
991,"01:04:55,720","01:04:57,240",They might be here a while.
992,"01:05:02,580","01:05:03,520",Where's the key?
993,"01:05:10,840","01:05:13,480",What was that? We might have a problem.
994,"01:05:16,279","01:05:17,399","No, no, no, no, no."
995,"01:05:34,910","01:05:49,440","I can't move. I'm moving. Grandson, hey."
996,"01:05:51,580","01:05:58,160","No, no, no. I'm almost there."
997,"01:06:18,650","01:06:23,690",Ow. That was so not worth it.
998,"01:06:28,570","01:06:30,490","You okay? Yeah, I'm good."
999,"01:06:31,010","01:06:32,430",Sonic. Hey.
1000,"01:06:33,590","01:06:39,530","Sonic one, concrete boulder zero. Thanks for the save."
1001,"01:06:39,750","01:06:43,350","Getting a little close, don't you think? Secure the room."
1002,"01:06:45,670","01:06:46,850",She's got the key.
1003,"01:06:49,550","01:06:50,650",I got an idea.
1004,"01:06:59,890","01:07:03,570","Commander Walters. Sir, you're..."
1005,"01:07:03,570","01:07:07,670",Still alive? I'll die before I let that key fall into the wrong hands.
1006,"01:07:08,450","01:07:11,010",Thanks for keeping it safe. I'll take it from here.
1007,"01:07:14,050","01:07:21,960","That's an order, Director Rockwell. Now, organize the reinforcements."
1008,"01:07:23,220","01:07:24,000","Yes, sir."
1009,"01:07:30,300","01:07:33,640","Guys, guys, I got the key. I repeat, I got the key. Now, let's get out of here."
1010,"01:07:39,280","01:07:42,600","Commander Walters. No, no, no, wait."
1011,"01:07:58,820","01:08:05,140","Everyone's clear. Come on, let's go. You, what are you... Tom."
1012,"01:08:07,120","01:08:11,980","Tom, Tom, what happened? Speak to me. Come on, come on, come on, come on. It's going to be okay."
1013,"01:08:13,040","01:08:15,860","Please, please, please get up. Come on, please wake up."
1014,"01:08:16,120","01:08:19,760","Wake up, wake up, wake up, come on. Wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up."
1015,"01:08:20,320","01:08:20,820",Who are you?
1016,"01:08:25,540","01:08:31,190",What did you do? What I had to.
1017,"01:08:34,070","01:08:35,450","Oh, my God, Tom."
1018,"01:08:38,610","01:08:40,110","Help me up, Tim."
1019,"01:08:45,200","01:08:49,410","Any tricks up your sleeve, Captain Gruntastic?"
1020,"01:08:56,460","01:08:58,210",We got what we came for.
1021,"01:08:59,430","01:09:05,050","Great job, Shadow. We have both keys."
1022,"01:09:05,880","01:09:08,210",So where's your little science project?
1023,"01:09:09,870","01:09:13,070","It's closer than you think, my boy."
1024,"01:09:16,130","01:09:20,090",Welcome to my masterpiece.
1025,"01:09:23,760","01:09:28,590",I must hand it to Gunn. They built her to my exact specifications.
1026,"01:09:34,179","01:09:36,500",Remarkable. Astounding.
1027,"01:09:37,159","01:09:41,200","Yes, that's my genius, Grand Gino."
1028,"01:09:41,520","01:09:44,740",And I have one more surprise.
1029,"01:09:47,520","01:09:50,700",It's a new suit.
1030,"01:10:00,860","01:10:01,380",Gee.
1031,"01:10:21,060","01:10:25,380",I'm a chip off the old block. I'm a chip off the old block.
1032,"01:10:25,880","01:10:27,960",I'm a chip off the old block.
1033,"01:10:29,960","01:10:32,080","What do you want, Stone? I'm busy."
1034,"01:10:32,500","01:10:34,800","Doctor, I have a bad feeling about this."
1035,"01:10:35,180","01:10:37,760",I don't think your grandfather's been completely honest with us.
1036,"01:10:38,600","01:10:41,960",Something Shadow said. There's more to their plan.
1037,"01:10:44,220","01:10:45,980",How dare you?
1038,"01:10:47,000","01:10:50,920",You've been jealous of my long-lost grand pop-tart since the very beginning.
1039,"01:10:51,840","01:10:54,840",I no longer require your obsequious groveling.
1040,"01:10:55,360","01:10:56,980",Consider this your notice of termination.
1041,"01:10:57,460","01:11:00,160",Your letter of reference will be ill for loser.
1042,"01:11:01,060","01:11:04,340","Of course, I don't expect you to stay on until you've been successfully cloned."
1043,"01:11:04,340","01:11:07,280",But you and I are done.
1044,"01:11:08,220","01:11:10,360",Like a blackened catfish dinner.
1045,"01:11:11,140","01:11:13,780","Sir, it's too dangerous and I'm not there to protect you."
1046,"01:11:14,140","01:11:15,260",I already lost you once.
1047,"01:11:15,440","01:11:16,720","Unsubscribe, blackened reporter."
1048,"01:11:18,200","01:11:19,760",I can't lose you again.
1049,"01:11:26,970","01:11:29,710","To the honors, grandson."
1050,"01:11:36,390","01:13:07,060","Be okay, Sonic."
1051,"01:13:07,680","01:13:08,540",It'll be okay?
1052,"01:13:09,060","01:13:11,800",Tom is fighting for his life and you think it'll be okay?
1053,"01:13:12,420","01:13:15,000",The fox is simply trying to comfort you.
1054,"01:13:15,640","01:13:16,800",Comfort's not what I need right now.
1055,"01:13:17,220","01:13:18,420",I need to stop them.
1056,"01:13:18,880","01:13:20,180",By any means necessary.
1057,"01:13:20,640","01:13:22,060","Wait, you don't mean..."
1058,"01:13:22,060","01:13:23,660",The Master Emerald.
1059,"01:13:24,100","01:13:26,760",The Emerald must never be wielded for vengeance.
1060,"01:13:27,420","01:13:27,960",Not ever.
1061,"01:13:28,660","01:13:30,100",We swore a sacred oath.
1062,"01:13:30,420","01:13:31,900",Don't talk to me about oaths.
1063,"01:13:31,920","01:13:32,420",Not now.
1064,"01:13:32,580","01:13:35,740",But you told Tom using the Emerald wasn't the right choice.
1065,"01:13:36,100","01:13:37,940","Well, now it's the only choice."
1066,"01:13:38,260","01:13:41,320","And if neither of you have the guts to help me, then I'll do it alone."
1067,"01:13:41,320","01:13:43,740",But I thought the three of us were a team.
1068,"01:13:44,020","01:13:45,820",I thought that's what made us special.
1069,"01:13:46,400","01:13:48,000","I'm not asking you twice, Knuckles."
1070,"01:13:48,820","01:13:51,000",Where is the Master Emerald?
1071,"01:13:53,220","01:13:56,280","Your heart is being consumed by anger, Hedgehog."
1072,"01:13:56,600","01:13:59,540",You are in no condition to make decisions right now.
1073,"01:13:59,640","01:14:01,300",I know you're upset about Tom.
1074,"01:14:01,620","01:14:02,420",We all are.
1075,"01:14:02,580","01:14:03,520",Last chance.
1076,"01:14:04,860","01:14:06,280",Where is it?
1077,"01:14:07,200","01:14:08,400",Don't do this.
1078,"01:14:15,200","01:14:18,140",Part of our oath is to trust each other.
1079,"01:14:18,660","01:14:20,600",And I must abide by that promise.
1080,"01:14:20,840","01:14:22,840",Even if you have chosen to break it.
1081,"01:14:23,400","01:14:24,620",But heed this warning.
1082,"01:14:25,260","01:14:28,480",The Master Emerald is guarded by a fearsome warrior.
1083,"01:14:28,800","01:14:34,280","And to seize this ultimate power, you will have to go through him."
1084,"01:14:36,180","01:14:36,820","Okay, wait."
1085,"01:14:37,280","01:14:38,660",All comes down to this.
1086,"01:14:40,080","01:14:41,140",The last few seconds.
1087,"01:14:41,580","01:14:42,520",Whipple down the ice.
1088,"01:14:42,860","01:14:43,420",He shoots.
1089,"01:14:43,640","01:14:44,740",He scores!
1090,"01:14:46,380","01:14:49,020",Wayne Whipple is the champion again!
1091,"01:14:51,280","01:14:56,060","Oh, hey, Sonic."
1092,"01:14:56,400","01:14:57,000",See my goal?
1093,"01:14:57,360","01:14:58,260","Pretty sick, right?"
1094,"01:14:58,920","01:15:00,020",I'm here for the Emerald.
1095,"01:15:00,580","01:15:01,980","Look, Sonic, I'm sorry."
1096,"01:15:02,180","01:15:04,180",I promised to guard this Emerald with my life.
1097,"01:15:04,360","01:15:06,020",I will do whatever it takes.
1098,"01:15:07,160","01:15:08,140","Well, I tried."
1099,"01:15:18,760","01:15:19,340",All right!
1100,"01:15:22,660","01:15:25,340",This is an urgent national emergency broadcast.
1101,"01:15:26,520","01:15:31,160",A spacecraft designed by the Agency GUN has been hijacked and launched out of the River Thames.
1102,"01:15:31,960","01:15:34,500",Eggman is believed to be the culprit.
1103,"01:15:36,760","01:15:40,180",All residents are urged to seek immediate shelter.
1104,"01:16:05,570","01:16:09,190","Professor, is this really what Maria would have wanted?"
1105,"01:16:12,500","01:16:15,260",The question isn't what Maria would have wanted.
1106,"01:16:16,680","01:16:18,140",It's what do they deserve.
1107,"01:16:19,560","01:16:21,940",Remember what you meant to us.
1108,"01:16:24,200","01:16:26,540",Remember what they took from us.
1109,"01:16:37,880","01:16:39,960","Prince, we have to go, now!"
1110,"01:16:44,980","01:16:47,380","They want to take Shadow away from us, Maria!"
1111,"01:16:55,880","01:16:56,360",Hey!
1112,"01:16:56,640","01:16:57,100",Hey!
1113,"01:16:57,340","01:16:58,000",What are you doing?
1114,"01:16:58,000","01:16:58,660",Those are children!
1115,"01:16:58,900","01:16:59,780",We've got an order!
1116,"01:16:59,900","01:17:00,620",Stand down!
1117,"01:17:26,460","01:17:27,240",Maria!
1118,"01:18:14,609","01:18:17,030","Excuse me, Grand Pasa Doble."
1119,"01:18:17,470","01:18:20,230",What is that thermonuclear gerbil doing?
1120,"01:18:20,930","01:18:24,270",Infusing the core with chaos energy.
1121,"01:18:25,030","01:18:26,450",That's my little secret.
1122,"01:18:27,250","01:18:32,270","The Eclipse Cannon is about to turn this planet into a flaming pile of rubble,"
1123,"01:18:32,830","01:18:42,510","wiping out everything in a 25,000 mile radius, including us."
1124,"01:18:46,820","01:18:47,330",What?
1125,"01:18:48,710","01:18:51,910",We can't annihilate the Earth!
1126,"01:18:52,470","01:18:57,070","By combining our genius, we can rule humanity, together!"
1127,"01:18:57,730","01:18:59,910",Humanity is a failed experiment.
1128,"01:19:00,830","01:19:03,050","If anyone should know that, it's you."
1129,"01:19:03,730","01:19:06,970","All your life, you've been rejected by this world."
1130,"01:19:08,510","01:19:09,830",You have nothing down there.
1131,"01:19:11,470","01:19:13,430",No one who cares about you.
1132,"01:19:15,530","01:19:16,790",But I have you now.
1133,"01:19:19,640","01:19:20,480",We're family.
1134,"01:19:21,680","01:19:22,840",We have each other.
1135,"01:19:24,860","01:19:25,820","Oh, Ivo."
1136,"01:19:27,640","01:19:29,040",You're no Maria.
1137,"01:19:29,660","01:19:36,140","I lost her, my family was gone forever!"
1138,"01:19:37,780","01:19:42,460",The only way to give Maria's life meaning is to destroy the world that took her from me.
1139,"01:19:43,340","01:19:45,000",So I'm burning it all down!
1140,"01:19:47,740","01:19:48,900",It's done.
1141,"01:19:49,560","01:19:50,720","Good work, Shadow."
1142,"01:19:51,580","01:19:53,320",I'm prepping the firing sequence.
1143,"01:19:54,260","01:19:57,060",The weapon will be fully charged in 10 minutes.
1144,"01:20:01,110","01:20:03,170","It's almost finished, Maria."
1145,"01:20:04,030","01:20:06,070",You will have justice.
1146,"01:20:09,790","01:20:10,310",What?
1147,"01:20:10,710","01:20:12,010",What is that?
1148,"01:20:13,030","01:20:15,470",Is Gunn launching missiles at us?
1149,"01:20:16,110","01:20:16,770",Impossible.
1150,"01:20:17,510","01:20:18,710",It's moving too fast.
1151,"01:20:22,290","01:20:23,290",It's him!
1152,"01:20:32,350","01:20:33,810",You've hurt my family!
1153,"01:20:34,330","01:20:35,790",This ends now!
1154,"01:20:40,140","01:20:41,140",Fifty years!
1155,"01:20:41,860","01:20:44,680",You've made the same choice I did.
1156,"01:20:44,920","01:20:46,140",I'm nothing like you!
1157,"01:20:46,360","01:20:47,380",We'll see.
1158,"01:20:55,140","01:20:56,500","Show yourself, coward!"
1159,"01:21:28,880","01:21:29,760",One thing.
1160,"01:21:31,400","01:21:33,480",This ends now.
1161,"01:21:59,280","01:21:59,920",What?
1162,"01:22:00,020","01:22:00,300",What's happening?
1163,"01:22:00,780","01:22:01,940",Where are they?
1164,"01:22:02,820","01:22:03,520",Up there.
1165,"01:22:03,820","01:22:04,140",Where?
1166,"01:22:04,380","01:22:04,700",Higher.
1167,"01:22:05,200","01:22:07,900",You left yourself open.
1168,"01:22:08,300","01:22:08,880",Ivo!
1169,"01:22:09,000","01:22:10,020",What are you doing?
1170,"01:22:10,020","01:22:12,000",Thwarting your evil plan!
1171,"01:22:23,520","01:22:24,080",Green!
1172,"01:22:24,580","01:22:25,360",Let go on three.
1173,"01:22:25,800","01:22:27,120","One, two, three!"
1174,"01:22:32,320","01:22:32,880",Oh.
1175,"01:22:34,180","01:22:35,300",A nanofist.
1176,"01:22:35,600","01:22:39,020",I haven't seen that since I hate-watched Green Lantern in 2011.
1177,"01:22:39,020","01:22:41,220",I was saving it for Comic-Con.
1178,"01:22:41,420","01:22:43,660",But now there won't be a Comic-Con!
1179,"01:22:56,240","01:23:08,480",Where are your friends?
1180,"01:23:09,800","01:23:12,440","They tried to stop you, didn't they?"
1181,"01:23:12,880","01:23:14,180",But you came anyway.
1182,"01:23:14,760","01:23:16,480",Your anger was too much.
1183,"01:23:16,900","01:23:21,640",What kind of hero abandons his friends to pursue revenge?
1184,"01:23:22,300","01:23:24,080",Abandons his family?
1185,"01:23:24,680","01:23:26,860",Don't you dare talk about my family!
1186,"01:23:27,460","01:23:29,660",And here I thought you cared for them.
1187,"01:23:30,260","01:23:31,660",Especially the one...
1188,"01:23:32,200","01:23:33,060",What's his name?
1189,"01:23:33,820","01:23:34,660",Tom?
1190,"01:23:54,920","01:23:55,640",No!
1191,"01:24:00,260","01:24:01,500",Go ahead!
1192,"01:24:01,760","01:24:02,560",Finish it!
1193,"01:24:04,160","01:24:05,740",What are you waiting for?
1194,"01:24:06,060","01:24:06,600",Do it!
1195,"01:24:07,200","01:24:08,480",I'm right here!
1196,"01:24:09,960","01:24:12,340",You didn't let your pain change who you are.
1197,"01:24:13,980","01:24:14,540",In here.
1198,"01:24:18,560","01:24:24,730",This is not who I am.
1199,"01:24:25,930","01:24:26,990",What are you doing?
1200,"01:24:27,650","01:24:28,350",You won!
1201,"01:24:29,010","01:24:30,150",Take your revenge!
1202,"01:24:32,120","01:24:34,020",There are no winners with revenge.
1203,"01:24:49,420","01:24:50,520",Look at all those stars.
1204,"01:24:56,140","01:25:02,410","The last time I sat beneath stars like this, I was with her."
1205,"01:25:04,490","01:25:06,470",I felt this pain for so long.
1206,"01:25:08,190","01:25:09,590",It's all I know.
1207,"01:25:10,730","01:25:14,010","When I lost Longclaw, I felt the same way."
1208,"01:25:16,110","01:25:18,230",Did your pain eventually go away?
1209,"01:25:19,510","01:25:19,810",No.
1210,"01:25:20,550","01:25:24,310","But in time, I learned there's something even more powerful than pain."
1211,"01:25:25,070","01:25:26,930",The love we felt for each other.
1212,"01:25:28,250","01:25:30,210","That's what you need to hold on to, Shadow."
1213,"01:25:31,030","01:25:34,410","Maria might be gone, but your love will always remain."
1214,"01:25:48,840","01:25:52,820","The light shines, even though the star is gone."
1215,"01:26:04,700","01:26:06,320",This whole mess is my fault.
1216,"01:26:07,000","01:26:11,760","I've been so blinded by rage, I thought I had no choice."
1217,"01:26:15,800","01:26:17,320",You always have a choice.
1218,"01:26:23,060","01:26:25,420",Making the right one is never easy.
1219,"01:26:26,340","01:26:29,840","One more thing I learned is that when you really screw something up,"
1220,"01:26:30,580","01:26:31,880",you can't fix it on your own.
1221,"01:26:46,600","01:26:48,180",Gotta go fast.
1222,"01:26:48,620","01:26:51,200",Don't tell me you've got a catchphrase.
1223,"01:26:51,520","01:26:52,740","That's right, new hedgehog."
1224,"01:26:52,880","01:26:54,480",And everyone loves it.
1225,"01:27:09,480","01:27:18,840",I will not try to stop my elders from destroying the world.
1226,"01:27:24,540","01:27:26,060",Playtime is over.
1227,"01:27:34,780","01:27:37,000",There's no going back now.
1228,"01:27:41,040","01:27:43,420",Set up defense.
1229,"01:27:45,220","01:27:47,120","Damn you, autocorrect."
1230,"01:27:52,540","01:27:53,360",Mantis!
1231,"01:28:03,180","01:28:05,660","I'm right here, Arachnerd."
1232,"01:28:15,940","01:28:18,820",That's what I call mantiscaping.
1233,"01:28:19,460","01:28:21,660",That's elder abuse.
1234,"01:28:27,760","01:28:31,260","Alert, alert, alert."
1235,"01:28:31,300","01:28:34,760","Shadow, I see you've chosen betrayal."
1236,"01:28:36,000","01:28:38,620",And you were once so useful to me.
1237,"01:28:54,040","01:28:56,880",Are you ready to recycle some tin cans?
1238,"01:28:56,980","01:28:58,060",Just try to keep up.
1239,"01:29:29,140","01:29:32,680","Please, Grandson, don't do this."
1240,"01:29:32,980","01:29:34,180","Sorry, kiddo."
1241,"01:29:35,180","01:29:37,620",Bringing your grandkid to work day is over.
1242,"01:29:44,320","01:29:46,080",Any last words?
1243,"01:29:46,960","01:29:51,740",Just one thing that I never thought I'd say.
1244,"01:29:52,440","01:29:53,380",What is it?
1245,"01:29:54,440","01:29:55,860",I love you.
1246,"01:29:56,740","01:29:59,820","No, it was something even better."
1247,"01:30:00,220","01:30:02,520",But I'm not gonna say it if that's the way you're gonna be.
1248,"01:30:03,360","01:30:04,220","Okay, bye."
1249,"01:30:16,600","01:30:22,560","Oh, Grandchildren, all the fun and none of the responsibility."
1250,"01:30:24,940","01:30:27,400",Who said life was pointless?
1251,"01:30:29,020","01:30:31,360","Oh, right, you did."
1252,"01:30:37,680","01:30:38,520","Ah, victory!"
1253,"01:30:39,060","01:30:40,560",See what you want about my granddad?
1254,"01:30:41,440","01:30:42,860",He made one hell of a bug zapper.
1255,"01:30:45,300","01:30:46,920",You gotta stop that laser!
1256,"01:30:47,540","01:30:49,480",I knew there was something I was forgetting.
1257,"01:31:00,320","01:31:03,180",We're out of time. The cannon is about to fire.
1258,"01:31:03,620","01:31:04,380",Where are you?
1259,"01:31:04,640","01:31:06,800","Uh, you know, just making friends."
1260,"01:31:07,420","01:31:08,920",They're all yours.
1261,"01:31:17,520","01:31:18,800",Follow me.
1262,"01:31:25,140","01:31:27,520",Now this might hurt a little.
1263,"01:31:41,280","01:31:43,960",So this was your plan?
1264,"01:31:45,700","01:31:49,560",Would someone mind shutting down the giant death ray?
1265,"01:31:51,580","01:31:53,760",We can't stop the cannon from firing.
1266,"01:31:54,120","01:31:56,080",But we can steer it away from the Earth.
1267,"01:31:56,400","01:31:57,520",Coming around the starboard.
1268,"01:31:57,700","01:31:58,420","Aye, aye, doc."
1269,"01:31:58,420","01:31:59,120",Yes!
1270,"01:32:02,360","01:32:04,060",Here we go.
1271,"01:32:05,760","01:32:06,640",It's a little tight.
1272,"01:32:08,140","01:32:10,440",Definitely not power steering.
1273,"01:32:16,700","01:32:18,460",Keep turning.
1274,"01:32:21,460","01:32:23,660",Jump at any time. Here goes.
1275,"01:32:29,200","01:32:33,020",Can't hold much longer.
1276,"01:32:45,920","01:32:53,920",Yes! I did it! I did it!
1277,"01:32:59,320","01:33:00,800",Look what you did!
1278,"01:33:00,880","01:33:02,440","Hey, look down there!"
1279,"01:33:02,780","01:33:03,420",Sonny!
1280,"01:33:11,950","01:33:13,030",Lost one.
1281,"01:33:46,360","01:33:48,300",Really? What's happening?
1282,"01:33:48,880","01:33:50,400",The reactor core is overloading.
1283,"01:33:51,040","01:33:53,440",It's only a matter of time before it blows.
1284,"01:33:53,960","01:33:55,640",So what does that mean for Earth?
1285,"01:33:56,280","01:33:57,820",A radioactive atmosphere?
1286,"01:33:58,680","01:34:01,020",Rain that kills the crops and melts your flesh?
1287,"01:34:01,360","01:34:02,820",Other than that...
1288,"01:34:02,820","01:34:04,080",We're not done here.
1289,"01:34:04,560","01:34:06,480",You try to stabilize the reactor.
1290,"01:34:06,480","01:34:07,820",Buy me some time.
1291,"01:34:08,220","01:34:11,380",I'll push the station away from Earth before it explodes.
1292,"01:34:11,580","01:34:15,960",This is our last chance to do the right thing.
1293,"01:34:23,200","01:34:25,060",Core integrity failing.
1294,"01:34:34,180","01:34:35,320","Oh, no!"
1295,"01:34:35,320","01:34:36,560","I'm sorry, Sonny!"
1296,"01:34:36,560","01:34:36,740",Dad!
1297,"01:35:40,290","01:35:41,530",Agent Stone!
1298,"01:35:42,370","01:35:44,050","No, no! Doctor, wait!"
1299,"01:35:44,350","01:35:46,250","If I can't rule the world,"
1300,"01:35:47,550","01:35:49,190",I might as well save it!
1301,"01:35:55,020","01:35:56,880","Stone, you..."
1302,"01:36:11,120","01:36:13,620",I'll miss your lattes with keen doctrine.
1303,"01:37:31,500","01:37:32,820","Sonic, look!"
1304,"01:37:43,140","01:37:44,580","Shadow and Robotnik,"
1305,"01:37:44,860","01:37:48,480",they sacrificed themselves to save everyone.
1306,"01:37:49,880","01:37:51,360",You always have a choice.
1307,"01:37:53,990","01:37:55,890",I'm really sorry for running off like that.
1308,"01:37:56,250","01:37:57,430",I shouldn't have left you behind.
1309,"01:37:59,530","01:38:00,170","The truth is,"
1310,"01:38:01,090","01:38:03,910",you're the best teammates a hedgehog could ever ask for.
1311,"01:38:07,720","01:38:08,920",Can you ever forgive me?
1312,"01:38:13,640","01:38:14,500",Team Sonic.
1313,"01:38:14,500","01:38:48,720",Big finish.
1314,"01:38:51,440","01:38:53,860",Now that's what I call teamwork.
1315,"01:38:59,720","01:39:00,680",How could you?
1316,"01:39:01,240","01:39:01,880",Gotta be mad!
1317,"01:39:04,020","01:39:04,620",Give me a break.
1318,"01:39:05,220","01:39:06,800",I'm a little slow over here.
1319,"01:39:06,960","01:39:07,280",Donut!
1320,"01:39:10,180","01:39:12,840",I am having the lunch.
1321,"01:39:21,100","01:39:23,420",And nothing is gonna stand in our way.
1322,"01:39:25,980","01:39:28,580",That one piece of unfinished business.
1323,"01:39:29,500","01:39:47,440",Let's do this!
1324,"01:39:48,040","01:39:48,240",Yeah!
