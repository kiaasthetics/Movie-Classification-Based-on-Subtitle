spoken to many cats who have."

A beautiful faraway island."

we need what? Boats. Right?"
137,"00:08:38,560","00:08:41,560","And to get boats, we need what?
Money. Right?"
138,"00:08:41,600","00:08:44,520","We have to keep making money.
Understand?"
139,"00:08:46,080","00:08:49,800","Fine. That's settled, then."

of the framing device, see?"
146,"00:09:21,120","00:09:24,440","I get to tell you stuff about this
story you wouldn't otherwise know."
147,"00:09:24,480","00:09:27,840","Like, I can tell you that Morris
never spoke to other cats"
148,"00:09:27,880","00:09:31,320","because no other cat
could speak back."
149,"00:09:31,360","00:09:33,800",Morris was as unique as the rats!
150,"00:09:33,840","00:09:37,000","He knew money was important, so he
lied to the rats to make more of it."
151,"00:09:37,040","00:09:39,800","In truth,
he was building himself a nest egg"
152,"00:09:39,840","00:09:44,200","so he could make good
on his deluxe retirement plan."
153,"00:09:44,240","00:09:47,880","And now you know Mr Bunnsy
is important to the story"
154,"00:09:47,920","00:09:50,720",because the rats believe he is real.
155,"00:09:50,760","00:09:54,720","They think they can find a land
where all the animals talk"
156,"00:09:54,760","00:09:57,720",and live happily ever after.

161,"00:10:11,360","00:10:15,240","it's because it's called
foreshadowing."
162,"00:10:15,280","00:10:17,320","Which is kind of a promise to you,"
163,"00:10:17,360","00:10:19,920","letting you know

164,"00:10:19,960","00:10:22,840",it's going to get...

or at least imply, strongly,"
179,"00:11:08,880","00:11:11,920",is that there must be a connection!

191,"00:11:44,680","00:11:48,040","that what you have here,"
192,"00:11:48,080","00:11:50,720","with the missing food,"
193,"00:11:50,760","00:11:54,560","is a mystery?
Mystery! Oh, yes! That's correct!"
194,"00:11:54,600","00:11:58,320","And with the rats gone,
none to be found,"
195,"00:11:58,360","00:12:01,400",that factor is simply...
196,"00:12:01,440","00:12:03,480",..unrelated.
197,"00:12:03,520","00:12:06,080",Unrelated!
198,"00:12:07,120","00:12:09,480",Mm-hm.
199,"00:12:11,520","00:12:14,080","Always nice to do business with you,"
200,"00:12:14,120","00:12:16,520",Mr Mayor!
201,"00:12:19,240","00:12:21,640","Mum?
What is it, love?"
202,"00:12:21,680","00:12:23,880",I'm hungry!
203,"00:12:23,920","00:12:27,280","How about we pick leaves from the
ground and make leaf sandwiches?"
204,"00:12:27,320","00:12:31,120","With no bread. Just leaves.
And imaginary jam."
205,"00:12:38,840","00:12:41,400",Stay low. Quiet as mice.
206,"00:12:50,560","00:12:52,680","Remember, this is a new town."
207,"00:12:52,720","00:12:56,120","There's bound to be new traps
and poisons."
208,"00:12:58,760","00:13:01,040",Allow me.
209,"00:13:01,080","00:13:06,240","Why do we wear clothes?
It makes no... sense!"
210,"00:13:06,280","00:13:09,880",Unless we're on stage!
211,"00:13:09,920","00:13:12,760",Dangerous Beans says it's civilised.
212,"00:13:12,800","00:13:14,680","And the concept of the belt
is worthy."
213,"00:13:14,720","00:13:17,680","You never know
what you're going to need next."
214,"00:13:17,720","00:13:19,880",Move on!
215,"00:13:23,720","00:13:26,960","All right, let's stop here!"
216,"00:13:28,360","00:13:32,840","Number Three Platoon - In-Brine,
Sell-By, Sardines and Delicious,"
217,"00:13:32,880","00:13:34,360",you're on widdling duty.
218,"00:13:34,400","00:13:36,840","Go to it!
If I don't hear ladies screaming"
219,"00:13:36,880","00:13:40,000","and running out of their kitchens
within ten minutes,"
220,"00:13:40,040","00:13:42,160","then you're not the rats
I think you are."

225,"00:13:52,040","00:13:54,640","We don't want to be like
the first mouse, eh? No!"
226,"00:13:54,680","00:13:58,320","Right! What mouse do we want to
be like? The second mouse!"
227,"00:13:58,360","00:14:03,080","Because? Because
the second mouse gets the cheese!"
228,"00:14:03,120","00:14:04,440",You have a question?
229,"00:14:04,480","00:14:08,760","Er, what does the first mouse get?"
230,"00:14:25,360","00:14:27,760",The trap. See?
231,"00:14:27,800","00:14:31,800",And then the Bone Rat comes for ya!
232,"00:14:31,840","00:14:35,160",The Bone... ..Rat?
233,"00:14:35,200","00:14:38,160",Mm-mm.
234,"00:14:38,200","00:14:39,920",All right! Go! Go! Go!
235,"00:14:39,960","00:14:42,080","Keith and Maurice
will be in position soon."
236,"00:14:42,120","00:14:45,640","You know what
worries me, Dangerous Beans?"
237,"00:14:45,680","00:14:48,520","What is it that worries you,
Darktan?"
238,"00:14:48,560","00:14:51,760","There aren't any local rats here.
Normal rats, you know?"
239,"00:14:51,800","00:14:54,920","Rat tunnels? Yeah.
Rat droppings? In abundance!"
240,"00:14:54,960","00:14:56,680",But we've seen no actual rats.
241,"00:14:56,720","00:14:58,680","A town like this
should be full of 'em."
242,"00:14:58,720","00:15:00,440","Hm. It smells, doesn't it?"
243,"00:15:00,480","00:15:03,400",Yeah. It smells.
244,"00:15:03,440","00:15:06,560",It smells like a...
245,"00:15:08,760","00:15:11,400",A mystery.
246,"00:15:19,080","00:15:22,520",Hm. It's still all quiet.
247,"00:15:22,560","00:15:26,760","Sounds like the lads
didn't start their plague show yet."
248,"00:15:31,080","00:15:34,560",50 cents for every dead rat?
249,"00:15:36,120","00:15:38,240",They seem serious.
250,"00:15:38,280","00:15:42,360",50 cents! Huh! Must be a rich town.
251,"00:15:42,400","00:15:45,640","That's good. That's very good.
It means more money for me. Oh!"
252,"00:15:45,680","00:15:50,120","For us! For us, of course!"
253,"00:15:53,240","00:15:57,440","Yeah, looks like a town
with opportunities."
254,"00:15:58,960","00:16:00,880",But have you noticed...
255,"00:16:00,920","00:16:02,560",..there's no food?!
256,"00:16:02,600","00:16:07,600","That is odd! For a market town.
Yeah. Especially when you're hungry."
257,"00:16:07,640","00:16:10,680","Which is my way of saying,
""I'm really hungry!"""
258,"00:16:10,720","00:16:13,640","Oh, look, this one's open! Ahem!"
259,"00:16:13,680","00:16:15,440","Good day to you, sir!"
260,"00:16:15,480","00:16:18,000",We're looking for... food?
261,"00:16:18,040","00:16:20,880","Yes, well, there you go.
Right under your nose."
262,"00:16:20,920","00:16:24,320","Oh. Well, I guess, erm,
how much for the..."
263,"00:16:24,360","00:16:26,720","Too late. Huh?
It's gone."
264,"00:16:26,760","00:16:29,600","No, but we're very...
And now we're closed. Sorry!"
265,"00:16:29,640","00:16:31,200",Have a nice day!
266,"00:16:31,240","00:16:34,280","Maurice, what... What do you think?
Maurice?"
267,"00:16:35,320","00:16:37,800",Maurice!
268,"00:16:40,760","00:16:42,240",Maurice?
269,"00:16:44,000","00:16:45,320",Maurice?
270,"00:16:45,360","00:16:47,120",Agh! Oof!
271,"00:16:47,160","00:16:50,320","It has everything you would
traditionally want in a kitchen,"
272,"00:16:50,360","00:16:52,600",except for something to eat.
273,"00:16:52,640","00:16:55,240","Maurice, please, let's go,
before someone..."
274,"00:16:55,280","00:16:58,960","Quick, scratch me on the head!
There's a girl looking at us."
275,"00:17:02,160","00:17:03,400",What?
276,"00:17:03,440","00:17:07,320","Who's to say a narrator can't also
appear in the story she's telling?"
277,"00:17:07,360","00:17:09,600",Did that cat just say something?
278,"00:17:09,640","00:17:13,280","Huh? Cats can't talk!
Everybody knows that."
279,"00:17:13,320","00:17:15,520","Ah, I get it.
You brought the cat here"
280,"00:17:15,560","00:17:18,120","because you know there's a famine
and you're going to sell it."
281,"00:17:18,160","00:17:20,280","There's at least two good meals
on those bones."
282,"00:17:20,320","00:17:22,640",What? You eat cats here?
283,"00:17:22,680","00:17:24,000",Ha! Got you!
284,"00:17:24,040","00:17:26,640","Yep, she got ya.
Mm."
285,"00:17:26,680","00:17:28,680","Well, there's some milk
that's not gone hard yet,"
286,"00:17:28,720","00:17:31,240","and a couple of fish heads.
That will have to do."
287,"00:17:31,280","00:17:33,600",Do? That will be ideal!
288,"00:17:33,640","00:17:36,120","But maybe we shouldn't eat your food
if there is so little?"
289,"00:17:36,160","00:17:39,400","No, no, no. My father, who happens
to be the mayor, by the way,"
290,"00:17:39,440","00:17:41,160",says we need to be hospitable.
291,"00:17:41,200","00:17:42,720",So tell me your name.
292,"00:17:42,760","00:17:44,080","Er, Keith."
293,"00:17:44,120","00:17:47,560","Oh, that won't do!
No hint of mystery."
294,"00:17:47,600","00:17:49,680",It just hints of... Keith!
295,"00:17:49,720","00:17:53,560","Are you sure that's your real name?
I don't know. I'm an orphan."
296,"00:17:53,600","00:17:56,480","Ah, yeah! Mm! That's more like it.
A mysterious past."
297,"00:17:56,520","00:17:58,480","You were stolen at birth, I expect."
298,"00:17:58,520","00:18:01,920","You're probably the rightful king
of some distant country"
299,"00:18:01,960","00:18:04,280","and they found someone
who looked like you and did a swap!"
300,"00:18:04,320","00:18:07,520","In that case,
you'll have a magic sword,"
301,"00:18:07,560","00:18:10,320","only it won't look magic, you see,
until it's time for you"
302,"00:18:10,360","00:18:12,880",to manifest your destiny!
303,"00:18:12,920","00:18:16,640","You were probably found on a
doorstep. Er, actually a hay cart."
304,"00:18:16,680","00:18:21,080","Just as good! Hey, it's customary
when somebody asks your name"
305,"00:18:21,120","00:18:24,720",to reciprocate and ask them theirs.
306,"00:18:26,080","00:18:28,240","I'm Malicia Grim, by the way."
307,"00:18:28,280","00:18:29,920","Er... Hello,"
308,"00:18:29,960","00:18:31,680","erm, Malicia."
309,"00:18:31,720","00:18:35,680","Nice, erm, to...
No! Sardines! Back!"
310,"00:18:35,720","00:18:37,520",Rat!
311,"00:18:41,880","00:18:44,800","Sardines, no!
Easy on the tap dancing!"
312,"00:18:44,840","00:18:46,440",Sorry! I've just got these...
313,"00:18:46,480","00:18:48,440",..d-dancing feet!
314,"00:18:48,480","00:18:50,080","Whoa!
Ugh!"
315,"00:18:51,520","00:18:57,240","All right.
I think it goes like this..."
316,"00:18:57,280","00:19:01,880","This rat is clearly a magical rat.
I bet he's not the only one."
317,"00:19:01,920","00:19:04,600","Born that way, or something happened
to him, or them,"
318,"00:19:04,640","00:19:07,960","and now they're quite intelligent,
despite the tap dancing."
319,"00:19:08,000","00:19:12,120","And the cat is friends with you...
Why would rats and a cat be friends?"
320,"00:19:12,160","00:19:16,120","There must be some kind of
an arrangement. No, don't tell me!"
321,"00:19:16,160","00:19:19,000","I shouldn't think anyone
ever has to tell you anything."
322,"00:19:19,040","00:19:20,880","Something to do with
plagues of rats, right?"
323,"00:19:20,920","00:19:24,320","All those towns we've heard about?
You got together with Keith here"
324,"00:19:24,360","00:19:27,440","and you go from town to town
pretending to BE a plague of rats,"
325,"00:19:27,480","00:19:31,360","Keith pretends to be a pied piper
and they all follow him out"
326,"00:19:31,400","00:19:34,600","and you make loads of cash, right?"
327,"00:19:34,640","00:19:37,160",It's all a big swindle.
328,"00:19:38,560","00:19:41,720","She's got us bang to rights, boss."
329,"00:19:41,760","00:19:43,760","You won't tell on us, will you?
Ha!"
330,"00:19:43,800","00:19:46,840","A talking cat
and a talking, tap-dancing rat?"
331,"00:19:46,880","00:19:48,960","They'll think I'm making up stories
again"
332,"00:19:49,000","00:19:52,720","and I'll be locked out of my room
as punishment. Locked out?"
333,"00:19:52,760","00:19:56,960","So I can't get to my books. It might
not be obvious, but I read a lot."
334,"00:19:57,000","00:19:59,120","My father says ""Too much!"""
335,"00:19:59,160","00:20:00,360",Ah!
336,"00:20:00,400","00:20:03,840","So, here's the question -
how did you learn to talk?"
337,"00:20:03,880","00:20:06,120","In a real story,
this is where we'd get a flashback."
338,"00:20:06,160","00:20:09,280","Flashback? What's that?
It's where you get the backstory."
339,"00:20:09,320","00:20:12,440","Go ahead, tell me what happened."
340,"00:20:13,760","00:20:16,720","There doesn't seem to be a way
to tell her no."
341,"00:20:16,760","00:20:19,720",What happened? Er...
342,"00:20:19,760","00:20:21,920","No-one knows for sure, you know,
but, erm..."
343,"00:20:21,960","00:20:26,240",Rats eat rubbish. That's what we do!
344,"00:20:26,280","00:20:29,280","That was back when we were just
normal, everyday rats,"
345,"00:20:29,320","00:20:30,920",squeaking and squabbling.
346,"00:20:30,960","00:20:34,200","We ate whatever we could find.
The stubs of candles, for example!"
347,"00:20:34,240","00:20:36,040",We love candle stubs!
348,"00:20:36,080","00:20:38,000",And a weather-beaten broomstick.
349,"00:20:38,040","00:20:41,920","That can be good to get your teeth
into. And powders and potions."
350,"00:20:41,960","00:20:45,320","We drank green bubbly stuff
from the bottoms of cauldrons"
351,"00:20:45,360","00:20:47,880","and gnawed our way
through worn-out spell books."
352,"00:20:47,920","00:20:50,480","Ha! Doesn't sound like an ordinary
rubbish heap!"
353,"00:20:50,520","00:20:52,120",We eventually figured that out.
354,"00:20:52,160","00:20:56,160","The dump belonged to
Unseen University of Ankh-Morpork..."
355,"00:20:57,160","00:21:00,840","..the establishment of learning,
where magic is studied."
356,"00:21:00,880","00:21:04,480","All the mixed-up magic leftovers
from the men in pointy hats!"
357,"00:21:04,520","00:21:05,560",I like it.
358,"00:21:05,600","00:21:07,520","Once we got smart,
we learned to read"
359,"00:21:07,560","00:21:10,000","and gave ourselves names from
the things we found in the dump."
360,"00:21:10,040","00:21:11,760","""Sardines."""
361,"00:21:11,800","00:21:13,640","""Peaches."""
362,"00:21:13,680","00:21:15,760","""In-Brine!"""
363,"00:21:15,800","00:21:18,600","What of the cat?
Cats don't eat any old rubbish."
364,"00:21:18,640","00:21:21,000","Decidedly not!
He never ate anything off the dump,"
365,"00:21:21,040","00:21:24,080","but he did get intelligent
around the same time."
366,"00:21:24,120","00:21:27,040","As an intelligent cat, I do vow,
and it is a point of pride,"
367,"00:21:27,080","00:21:29,400",to not eat anything that can speak.
368,"00:21:29,440","00:21:33,080","I know just what we must do next
to solve the mystery of our town!"
369,"00:21:33,120","00:21:36,840","Huh? What mystery?
The missing food! The rats are gone!"
370,"00:21:36,880","00:21:39,920","Why else would you be in this story,
if not to solve the mystery?"
371,"00:21:39,960","00:21:42,720","We need to sneak into
the Rat-Catcher's Guild"
372,"00:21:42,760","00:21:45,280",and find out what they're up to.
373,"00:21:45,320","00:21:48,560",Ah. I am oddly compelled to follow.
374,"00:21:48,600","00:21:52,040","It's a gift.
I'm off to get my adventure bag."
375,"00:21:53,440","00:21:56,120",Yah! Ready?
376,"00:21:57,120","00:21:59,160",Let's go!
377,"00:22:02,240","00:22:04,320",I think I love her.
378,"00:22:13,920","00:22:16,000","Er, sir?"
379,"00:22:16,040","00:22:19,040","You, er, you wanted to see us,"
380,"00:22:19,080","00:22:21,400",sir.
381,"00:22:21,440","00:22:24,880",There are new rats in town.
382,"00:22:24,920","00:22:29,320","Are you sure, sir?"
383,"00:22:29,360","00:22:34,040","The traps are empty. We...
I can feel it!"
384,"00:22:37,040","00:22:40,160",Catch them and bring them to me.
385,"00:22:40,200","00:22:42,880","Yes, sir! Right off, sir!"
386,"00:22:42,920","00:22:45,120",You know I have a thing...
387,"00:22:45,160","00:22:47,560",..for rats.
388,"00:22:56,560","00:22:59,360",Important safety tip.
389,"00:22:59,400","00:23:01,920","Don't eat a dead rat
that just ate something,"
390,"00:23:01,960","00:23:04,600","that just ate something,
that made it dead."
391,"00:23:04,640","00:23:07,880","Dangerous Beans says
we shouldn't eat rats at all."
392,"00:23:07,920","00:23:11,880","True. Very true.
Unless you're hungry."
393,"00:23:11,920","00:23:15,440","But rats are always hungry.
My point exactly."
394,"00:23:15,480","00:23:18,280",Strange.
395,"00:23:18,320","00:23:20,760","Reminds me of, erm,"
396,"00:23:20,800","00:23:23,320","a Prattle and Johnson
Little Snapper,"
397,"00:23:23,360","00:23:25,680","but those are not round
like this one."
398,"00:23:25,720","00:23:28,040",Mm...
399,"00:23:28,080","00:23:33,400","Ah...
And there's no extra safety catch."
400,"00:23:33,440","00:23:36,720",I think we need... Mr Clicky.
401,"00:23:36,760","00:23:40,240","Mr Clicky!
Come on, Mr Clicky."
402,"00:23:43,040","00:23:45,000",Mr Clicky!
403,"00:23:45,040","00:23:46,280","Oy, good luck, buddy!"
404,"00:23:46,320","00:23:48,280","It's showtime, Mr Clicky!"
405,"00:23:48,320","00:23:51,080","Go, Mr Clicky, you can do it!"
406,"00:23:51,120","00:23:52,960","On the double, soldier."
407,"00:23:54,920","00:23:56,760",What are you waiting for?
408,"00:23:56,800","00:23:59,320",Time to do your duty.
409,"00:23:59,360","00:24:02,080","Mr Clicky?
Hey!"
410,"00:24:02,120","00:24:05,240","Where do you think you're going?!
Come on, lad!"
411,"00:24:05,280","00:24:07,320",You're made of metal. This...
412,"00:24:07,360","00:24:09,040",can't... hurt.
413,"00:24:09,080","00:24:10,440",Ugh!
414,"00:24:11,760","00:24:13,600",Darktan?!
415,"00:24:17,440","00:24:19,920",Wh... What?
416,"00:24:23,680","00:24:25,040",What is this?
417,"00:24:25,080","00:24:27,440",Ingenious. Never seen this before.
418,"00:24:27,480","00:24:31,280","It's a cage.
A cage."
419,"00:24:31,320","00:24:33,920",A cage!
420,"00:24:33,960","00:24:36,000",What's a cage?
421,"00:24:36,040","00:24:38,320",It's used to capture a rat.
422,"00:24:38,360","00:24:41,760",Who would want to keep a rat?
423,"00:24:53,440","00:24:59,320","""And because of Olly the Snake's
trick with the road sign,"
424,"00:24:59,360","00:25:04,240","Mr Bunnsy did not know
that he had lost his way."""
425,"00:25:04,280","00:25:07,360","""He wasn't going
to Howard the Stoat's tea party."""
426,"00:25:08,360","00:25:12,760","""He was heading into the Dark Wood."""
427,"00:25:25,760","00:25:29,480","She seems to think that it's no good
looking inconspicuous"
428,"00:25:29,520","00:25:34,160","unless people can tell
that you are being inconspicuous."
429,"00:25:34,200","00:25:39,120","The trouble is, your lady friend
thinks life works like a fairy tale."
430,"00:25:39,160","00:25:41,840","Mm. That's harmless, though,
isn't it?"
431,"00:25:41,880","00:25:44,320","Maybe. But in fairy tales,"
432,"00:25:44,360","00:25:46,680",when someone gets hurt...
433,"00:25:47,680","00:25:49,880",..it's just a word.
434,"00:25:51,360","00:25:53,440",Hm?
435,"00:25:57,880","00:26:00,920","Luckily,
I'm prepared for every eventuality."
436,"00:26:00,960","00:26:03,520","The grapnel and the rope ladder
take up a lot of room."
437,"00:26:03,560","00:26:06,720","And then there's the medicine kit
and the kettle, the back-up kettle,"
438,"00:26:06,760","00:26:09,720","the sewing kit...
..and the mirror for sending signals"
439,"00:26:09,760","00:26:11,840",and these!
440,"00:26:11,880","00:26:15,760","Hair pins? You just push it
into the keyhole and twiddle."
441,"00:26:15,800","00:26:19,280","Malicia, those things work
in stories, not... That's right!"
442,"00:26:19,320","00:26:23,320","Oh, dear me. So,
we're back in your story, are we?"
443,"00:26:23,360","00:26:24,880",And what am I in your story?
444,"00:26:24,920","00:26:29,000","Mm, not sure. You're not handsome
enough for a love interest"
445,"00:26:29,040","00:26:31,480","and you're not funny enough
for comic relief."
446,"00:26:31,520","00:26:34,040","Maybe you're just
the sympathetic friend"
447,"00:26:34,080","00:26:38,040","who serves as a sounding board to
help me resolve my ethical dilemmas."
448,"00:26:38,080","00:26:40,880","H-How is it you know
how to pick locks?"
449,"00:26:40,920","00:26:44,040","I told you, they lock me
out of my room to punish me."
450,"00:26:44,080","00:26:47,560","I've seen thieves at work,
""cat burglars"" they call them"
451,"00:26:47,600","00:26:49,920","because they are nearly as clever
as cats."
452,"00:26:49,960","00:26:52,120",They have complicated little tools
453,"00:26:52,160","00:26:54,480","which are used with great care
and precision."
454,"00:26:54,520","00:26:56,360",They don't ever just...
455,"00:26:57,680","00:26:58,920",There we are!
456,"00:26:58,960","00:27:00,680",That was luck.
457,"00:27:04,360","00:27:07,600","Oh, no! I didn't expect this!"
458,"00:27:07,640","00:27:11,120","Well, it's a dirty room full of junk,
what did you expect?"
459,"00:27:11,160","00:27:14,720","I was expecting something horrible,
yet interesting."
460,"00:27:14,760","00:27:18,160","Some ghastly clue
that would advance the plot."
461,"00:27:18,200","00:27:21,840","The world doesn't have a plot. Things
just happen, one after another."
462,"00:27:21,880","00:27:26,160","Pfft! There's always a plot.
You just have to know where to look."
463,"00:27:26,200","00:27:29,760","Ha! That's it!
A secret passage, of course!"
464,"00:27:29,800","00:27:32,360","Everyone, look for the entrance
to the secret passage!"
465,"00:27:32,400","00:27:34,360","What does a secret passage
look like?"
466,"00:27:34,400","00:27:37,120","Well, it won't look like one,
of course!"
467,"00:27:37,160","00:27:41,240","Oh, well, in that case,
I can see dozens of secret passages."
468,"00:27:41,280","00:27:44,000","Er, I don't know
how to look for something"
469,"00:27:44,040","00:27:46,800","that doesn't look like
the thing I'm looking for."
470,"00:27:46,840","00:27:49,080","Agh!
I know it's a rather daring idea,"
471,"00:27:49,120","00:27:51,840","but suppose there might not be
a secret passage?"
472,"00:27:51,880","00:27:53,840","There has to be!
But they're hard to find."
473,"00:27:53,880","00:27:56,040","And then you give up,"
474,"00:27:56,080","00:28:00,120","and it's when you give up and lean
against... that wall,"
475,"00:28:00,160","00:28:03,720","that you inadvertently operate
the secret switch!"
476,"00:28:06,640","00:28:08,040",Huh...
477,"00:28:08,080","00:28:12,760","I'll just rest my arm innocently
on this coat hook."
478,"00:28:12,800","00:28:16,680","And look! A sudden door in the wall
miraculously..."
479,"00:28:16,720","00:28:18,040",..fails to appear!
480,"00:28:18,080","00:28:20,200","Clearly, certain villains
totally fail to know"
481,"00:28:20,240","00:28:22,360","how to design
a proper secret passage."
482,"00:28:23,520","00:28:25,840","Keith, look!"
483,"00:28:25,880","00:28:29,440","Hey! Why is there a rat hole
in a rat-catchers' building?"
484,"00:28:29,480","00:28:32,600","I wouldn't come near this place
if I were a rat."
485,"00:28:32,640","00:28:35,160",Yes! That often happens in stories!
486,"00:28:35,200","00:28:39,120","The stupid person comes up
with the good idea by accident!"
487,"00:28:40,600","00:28:42,640","There's a sort of little lever
in there."
488,"00:28:42,680","00:28:45,800",I'll give it a... push.
489,"00:28:45,840","00:28:47,640",Agh!
490,"00:28:47,680","00:28:51,000","A trap door! Quite well-hidden.
No wonder we didn't see it!"
491,"00:28:51,040","00:28:54,200","Keith! Are you all right?
Not hurt!"
492,"00:28:54,240","00:28:55,760",Much.
493,"00:28:55,800","00:28:57,600",It's a sort of a cellar.
494,"00:28:57,640","00:29:00,120","I'm all right
because I landed on my head."
495,"00:29:01,920","00:29:04,480","Here's a ladder.
Why didn't you use it?"
496,"00:29:04,520","00:29:08,000","I was unable to take advantage of it
on account of..."
497,"00:29:08,040","00:29:10,560",..falling past it.
498,"00:29:10,600","00:29:12,080",Where's my hat?
499,"00:29:12,120","00:29:13,640",Ahh!
500,"00:29:30,560","00:29:33,560","Oh, my goodness!
Huh?"
501,"00:29:33,600","00:29:34,720",Food!
502,"00:29:40,640","00:29:43,320",Smoked ham!
503,"00:29:45,080","00:29:47,600",Mmm! So good!
504,"00:29:47,640","00:29:49,840","Wow!
Over here!"
505,"00:29:49,880","00:29:51,960",I found the bakery section!
506,"00:29:52,000","00:29:55,160",So they are stealing food...
507,"00:29:56,160","00:29:58,440","..mostly at night,"
508,"00:29:58,480","00:30:01,920",for some undetermined purpose.
509,"00:30:01,960","00:30:03,960",Those are the best mysteries!
510,"00:30:04,000","00:30:07,600","The more they are solved,
the more mysterious they get."
511,"00:30:12,800","00:30:15,080","All right, speak up.
Agh!"
512,"00:30:15,120","00:30:18,160","Just say a few words.
Or a poem maybe? What about a lim..."
513,"00:30:18,200","00:30:20,160",Agh! Peaches!
514,"00:30:20,200","00:30:25,080","It's you! Put me down! Do you mind?
Oh! Of course!"
515,"00:30:25,120","00:30:26,920",Keith! Sardines! We're in...
516,"00:30:26,960","00:30:30,560","Ah, don't worry, I know everything!"
517,"00:30:31,800","00:30:35,320","We're in trouble!
You won't believe what we've found!"
518,"00:30:35,360","00:30:37,840","I did ask you if you could talk,
didn't I? Yes, you did, but..."
519,"00:30:37,880","00:30:40,000","I'm quite vigilant about asking,
you know."
520,"00:30:40,040","00:30:42,120","Yes, yes! You've made your point!
I believe you!"
521,"00:30:42,160","00:30:45,440","But we're still in trouble!
Why? What's wrong?"
522,"00:30:49,560","00:30:51,760",Mr Clicky?
523,"00:30:51,800","00:30:56,000","What are you doing here? When I get
my hands on that wind-up toy..."
524,"00:30:56,040","00:30:58,280",Darktan! Are you hurt?
525,"00:30:58,320","00:31:00,320",Ugh!
526,"00:31:00,360","00:31:02,920",Pfffff! Just my pride.
527,"00:31:02,960","00:31:04,320","Here,"
528,"00:31:04,360","00:31:06,000",let me handle this.
529,"00:31:06,040","00:31:09,440","Where is he? I will crush
that useless piece of tin!"
530,"00:31:11,240","00:31:13,080",Stop!
531,"00:31:13,120","00:31:15,320","I just want to talk to ya.
It won't hurt!"
532,"00:31:15,360","00:31:19,640","Well, it will just a little!
Back off, Mr Too Many Belts!"
533,"00:31:19,680","00:31:22,120","It's not cool to pick on
the little guys."
534,"00:31:22,160","00:31:24,200",He had one job to do!
535,"00:31:24,240","00:31:27,480",You're safe with me now.
536,"00:31:30,640","00:31:33,080","Huh. So this is what they do.
Yeah."
537,"00:31:33,120","00:31:38,360","This is new. Insidious.
These traps, very cleverly designed."
538,"00:31:38,400","00:31:40,440",It would have to be to capture you!
539,"00:31:40,480","00:31:42,880","They are designed
to take us prisoner."
540,"00:31:42,920","00:31:45,000",Prisoner? What for?
541,"00:31:45,040","00:31:47,720","That's pretty much our business,"
542,"00:31:47,760","00:31:49,280",don't you think?
543,"00:31:49,320","00:31:52,400","I knew you were a part of this!
Ha!"
544,"00:31:52,440","00:31:55,520","Tell us a story, story-telling girl!"
545,"00:31:55,560","00:31:58,720","You're stealing food, somehow,
for some reason."
546,"00:31:58,760","00:32:02,880","To feed the rats you've captured,
maybe, and must be hiding somewhere."
547,"00:32:02,920","00:32:05,880","You don't need to be clever to see
that this is a bad situation"
548,"00:32:05,920","00:32:07,920","and might need running away from
quite soon."
549,"00:32:07,960","00:32:10,400","..so that's why the food
went missing. Get them!"
550,"00:32:11,560","00:32:14,640","Come here!
Such as now."
551,"00:32:14,680","00:32:19,440","Oh, you think Malicia is the only
person who can comment on the story?"
552,"00:32:23,120","00:32:26,680","Well, she thinks the story
is about her, but it's not."
553,"00:32:26,720","00:32:30,640","Check out the title
if you harbour any doubts."
554,"00:32:32,080","00:32:35,520","Oh, I hate cats!"
555,"00:32:35,560","00:32:38,400",Rats served on a silver platter!
556,"00:32:38,440","00:32:40,600","Get that thing off my foot!
Boss Man will be very happy!"
557,"00:32:42,560","00:32:45,080",And now the kids!
558,"00:32:45,120","00:32:47,720","Let go of me!
Go and tie 'em up somewhere. Let go!"
559,"00:32:47,760","00:32:51,480","Hey, look! The rat.
Why is it wearing a hat? Hm?"
560,"00:32:51,520","00:32:54,480",Huh!
561,"00:32:54,520","00:32:56,360","Billy, look at that! A show-rat!"
562,"00:32:56,400","00:33:01,720","Oh, don't look at me like that,
like I'm abandoning my friends."
563,"00:33:01,760","00:33:06,160","I'm a cat,
and cats choose their battles wisely!"
564,"00:33:06,200","00:33:09,400","Hey, Billy!
He'd be good for the pit."
565,"00:33:09,440","00:33:14,360",We'll call him The Rat With the Hat!
566,"00:33:30,680","00:33:33,720","What are they keeping us for?
Normally, a rat is trapped"
567,"00:33:33,760","00:33:35,200",and then...
568,"00:33:35,240","00:33:38,040","What's so funny, Dangerous Beans?"
569,"00:33:38,080","00:33:41,720","Maurice! I knew you wouldn't
let us down, old friend!"
570,"00:33:41,760","00:33:45,800","I've always said,
""We can depend on Maurice."""
571,"00:33:45,840","00:33:47,680","Never a doubt.
Mm. Right."
572,"00:33:47,720","00:33:51,760","I saw you rush off to start looking
for us, even before we were caught!"
573,"00:33:52,800","00:33:54,880",Ooh! Hey!
574,"00:33:54,920","00:33:59,440","So, what's your plan?
First, we get out of here.Excellent."
575,"00:33:59,480","00:34:01,880","Then get as far away from this town
as possible."
576,"00:34:01,920","00:34:04,400",Yeah. After we rescue Sardines.
577,"00:34:04,440","00:34:06,680","You left out that part.
Yes."
578,"00:34:06,720","00:34:08,440","An oversight.
Let me go over it again."
579,"00:34:08,480","00:34:10,280","First, we get out of here,"
580,"00:34:10,320","00:34:13,480","then...
Ahem! Plus the boy and the girl."
581,"00:34:13,520","00:34:16,840","They're tied up in another cellar.
We have to rescue them, too."
582,"00:34:16,880","00:34:18,880","Oh! Humans, you know!"
583,"00:34:18,920","00:34:21,960","They'll eventually work it all out,
deals will be struck!"
584,"00:34:22,000","00:34:24,880","We have to find out
where they took Sardines."
585,"00:34:24,920","00:34:27,960","Perhaps you heard them mention...
the pit?"
586,"00:34:29,880","00:34:33,440","I was in a place once,
a storage building."
587,"00:34:33,480","00:34:37,720","Some men came in and put a big
round wall in the middle of the floor"
588,"00:34:37,760","00:34:40,800",and called it... the pit.'
589,"00:34:40,840","00:34:44,920","They had a box of rats
and tipped them into the ring"
590,"00:34:44,960","00:34:49,120","and then then they put in the dogs.
Terriers. ''"
591,"00:34:49,160","00:34:51,040",The rats fought the dogs?
592,"00:34:51,080","00:34:52,440",Fought? No.
593,"00:34:52,480","00:34:56,400","Mostly they ran around and around.
It's called rat coursing."
594,"00:34:56,440","00:34:58,960",How is it we've never heard of this?
595,"00:34:59,000","00:35:01,920","Because there wouldn't be any rats
left to tell you."
596,"00:35:07,120","00:35:09,640","Right, then."
597,"00:35:10,600","00:35:14,800","Peaches, Dangerous Beans, Maurice,
you go free up Keith and Malicia."
598,"00:35:14,840","00:35:17,480","Nourishing, Special Offer,
Delicious In-Brine,"
599,"00:35:17,520","00:35:20,800","we rescue Sardines.
His trail will be easy to follow."
600,"00:35:22,960","00:35:26,080",He was widdling the entire way.
601,"00:35:35,920","00:35:38,400","So, let's go over it again,
shall we?"
602,"00:35:38,440","00:35:41,320","You don't have a knife
of any kind?"
603,"00:35:41,360","00:35:45,880","None. Or some handy matches
that could burn through the rope?"
604,"00:35:45,920","00:35:47,440",No. Sorry.
605,"00:35:47,480","00:35:50,840","Did you even look?
I looked!"
606,"00:35:57,440","00:35:59,120","You know, in many ways,"
607,"00:35:59,160","00:36:01,320","I don't think the plot
of this adventure"
608,"00:36:01,360","00:36:04,120",has been properly structured.
609,"00:36:06,160","00:36:08,720",Rrrrgh!
610,"00:36:27,400","00:36:30,080",Keep the pace!
611,"00:36:33,360","00:36:36,760","All right,
I'm running out of patience."
612,"00:36:36,800","00:36:39,480",I'm gonna start to reach here.
613,"00:36:39,520","00:36:44,480","This would be the ideal time for you
to discover your secret powers!"
614,"00:36:44,520","00:36:48,000","Oh! Great idea! Ah, yeah!"
615,"00:36:48,040","00:36:50,000","Oh...! Yes?
I feel..."
616,"00:36:50,040","00:36:52,920",Huh? Huh?
617,"00:36:52,960","00:36:55,400",No. Nothing.
618,"00:36:55,440","00:36:58,160",Ugh! Are you sure?
619,"00:36:58,200","00:37:01,840","When I first saw you I thought,
""He must have some amazing power"
620,"00:37:01,880","00:37:03,720","that will manifest itself
when we're in trouble."""
621,"00:37:03,760","00:37:07,400","""No-one could be that useless,
unless it was a disguise!"""
622,"00:37:07,440","00:37:11,320","No! Look, I'm the kind of person
heroes aren't."
623,"00:37:11,360","00:37:14,080","I'm a cheat, part of a rat scam."
624,"00:37:14,120","00:37:15,680",What I do is play music
625,"00:37:15,720","00:37:18,880","and I do that pretty well,
thank you."
626,"00:37:18,920","00:37:22,280",But I am not a hero in disguise.
627,"00:37:22,320","00:37:24,720",Sorry to disappoint you.
628,"00:37:26,080","00:37:28,640",Oh.
629,"00:37:28,680","00:37:31,280","So, you're the commoner"
630,"00:37:31,320","00:37:34,720",who has to rise to the occasion?
631,"00:37:34,760","00:37:37,720",You should've found someone else.
632,"00:37:37,760","00:37:39,360",Ow! There's something behind me!
633,"00:37:39,400","00:37:42,120","We're gnawing through the ropes!
What? Ow!"
634,"00:37:42,160","00:37:45,400","Hold still!
Dangerous Beans! Peaches!"
635,"00:37:45,440","00:37:50,800","It's about time!
Talking animals to the rescue!"
636,"00:37:50,840","00:37:53,680","Unbelievable!
This is almost too easy!"
637,"00:37:53,720","00:37:56,480",Almost like - pfft! - Mr Bunnsy.
638,"00:37:56,520","00:37:59,280",Mr Bunnsy? What about Mr Bunnsy?
639,"00:37:59,320","00:38:01,480","Oh, those are just books
for little kids!"
640,"00:38:01,520","00:38:04,480","There's a rat and a rabbit
and a snake"
641,"00:38:04,520","00:38:06,720","and they go around
having adventures."
642,"00:38:06,760","00:38:12,120","They wear clothes and talk to humans
and everyone's so nice and cosy."
643,"00:38:12,160","00:38:14,440",It is so silly!
644,"00:38:14,480","00:38:16,880","My father read them to me
when I was a kid.Erm..."
645,"00:38:16,920","00:38:18,360",I think you'd better stop.
646,"00:38:18,400","00:38:22,320","Morris? Of course,
now I see how simplistic they are!"
647,"00:38:22,360","00:38:24,720","No subtext, no social commentary."
648,"00:38:24,760","00:38:26,880",Doris the Duck loses a shoe?
649,"00:38:26,920","00:38:30,080","You call that narrative tension?
Malicia, please stop! What?"
650,"00:38:30,120","00:38:32,720",You knew! YOU KNEW!
651,"00:38:32,760","00:38:36,600","There's no island paradise.
There never was."
652,"00:38:36,640","00:38:39,400","You lied to us!
No, I..."
653,"00:38:39,440","00:38:41,800","Look... No, Peaches, don't!"
654,"00:38:41,840","00:38:44,800",I never had the heart to tell you.
655,"00:38:44,840","00:38:47,960","Peaches, it's all right. No!
Peaches!"
656,"00:38:48,000","00:38:50,720",Peaches? No!
657,"00:38:50,760","00:38:52,280",Peaches! Come back!
658,"00:38:52,320","00:38:55,280","Dangerous Beans, don't...
Peaches!"
659,"00:38:55,320","00:38:58,800",All their hopes... dashed.
660,"00:38:58,840","00:39:01,120",Bad cat! BAD CAT!
661,"00:39:01,160","00:39:04,920","Oh, I hate this feeling.
That you've done something wrong?"
662,"00:39:04,960","00:39:08,280","No! That I now need to do
something good to make up for it."
663,"00:39:08,320","00:39:13,280","Like, figure out how to get you two
past the rat-catchers."
664,"00:39:14,720","00:39:16,760",Peaches?
665,"00:39:18,440","00:39:21,040",Peaches?
666,"00:39:21,080","00:39:23,240",She came this way.
667,"00:39:24,240","00:39:27,920","Peaches, please!
We can work things out."
668,"00:39:27,960","00:39:32,200",The book is a lie! You lied to me!
669,"00:39:32,240","00:39:36,080","The book is not what matters!
It's what we make of it!"
670,"00:39:36,120","00:39:37,960",Go away!
671,"00:39:42,560","00:39:45,520","I don't think we are alone
down here."
672,"00:39:47,600","00:39:51,080","If you would just stay in one place
till I get to you!"
673,"00:39:51,120","00:39:53,320",Leave me alone!
674,"00:39:58,760","00:40:01,560",Beans?
675,"00:40:01,600","00:40:05,320","Beans? I think there's
something else down here!"
676,"00:40:10,640","00:40:13,920",Peaches!
677,"00:40:31,480","00:40:34,320",Bon appetit.
678,"00:40:34,360","00:40:36,680",Hey! It's that cat!
679,"00:40:36,720","00:40:39,200",Enjoying your last supper?
680,"00:40:39,240","00:40:41,440","What?
Hey..."
681,"00:40:41,480","00:40:44,040",What's this? Killalot.
682,"00:40:44,080","00:40:46,520","Oh. That sounds bad.
What?!"
683,"00:40:46,560","00:40:49,640","How did you...
Hey, you stole our poison!"
684,"00:40:49,680","00:40:53,280","Steal? No, no, no, no,
We don't steal."
685,"00:40:53,320","00:40:54,760",We just put it somewhere else.
686,"00:40:54,800","00:40:58,480","Set that down. That's dangerous
stuff! And tell me where you put it."
687,"00:40:58,520","00:41:01,800","Well, now that you mention it,
I think the cat there"
688,"00:41:01,840","00:41:04,720",put most of it in the sugar.
689,"00:41:06,080","00:41:08,520","Oh, I knew that tea tasted funny."
690,"00:41:08,560","00:41:12,600","You...
Don't even think of hurting us."
691,"00:41:12,640","00:41:15,920","We might forget
where we left the antidote."
692,"00:41:15,960","00:41:18,280",There is no antidote to Killalot!
693,"00:41:18,320","00:41:23,040","Oh, but there is. I know a few
experts on the topic of rat poison."
694,"00:41:23,080","00:41:24,720",Answers. Now.
695,"00:41:24,760","00:41:28,240","You caught rats alive
and crammed them into cages. Why?"
696,"00:41:28,280","00:41:31,480",I can feel things happening!
697,"00:41:31,520","00:41:33,880","Don't you know anything
about poison?"
698,"00:41:33,920","00:41:38,120","Your stomach won't start to melt
for about, oh, 20 minutes?"
699,"00:41:38,160","00:41:40,000",This is great stuff.
700,"00:41:40,040","00:41:42,760","Oh, this is inhuman!"
701,"00:41:42,800","00:41:46,600","No, it's extremely human. Your
poisons do it to rats every day."
702,"00:41:46,640","00:41:50,840","Now, tell me about the rats
in the cages."
703,"00:41:50,880","00:41:54,600","At first, we caught a few!
For the pit!"
704,"00:41:54,640","00:41:58,920","Then?
We accidentally made a Rat King."
705,"00:41:58,960","00:42:01,520",A Rat King?
706,"00:42:01,560","00:42:05,160","Is it still alive?
I've never seen him afraid before."
707,"00:42:05,200","00:42:07,560",IS IT STILL ALIVE?!
708,"00:42:07,600","00:42:09,680","Er, w-what is a Rat King?"
709,"00:42:09,720","00:42:12,640",Rat kings are deadly evil.
710,"00:42:12,680","00:42:15,760","A collection of rats, their tails
knotted together, and then..."
711,"00:42:15,800","00:42:19,440","We didn't mean to.
We put a handful of rats in a bucket"
712,"00:42:19,480","00:42:23,000","and later, when we opened the lid..."
713,"00:42:24,000","00:42:27,000",..there it was!
714,"00:42:27,040","00:42:31,680","The rats, together, their minds merge
to form one creature."
715,"00:42:31,720","00:42:35,320","It gains consciousness, power,
mind power."
716,"00:42:35,360","00:42:38,680",It can dominate and control others.
717,"00:42:38,720","00:42:41,160",This is a game-changer.
718,"00:42:41,200","00:42:44,280",A Rat King? No. This is too much.
719,"00:42:44,320","00:42:47,600","Oh, wait! Where are you going?"
720,"00:42:48,920","00:42:50,800","I, erm,"
721,"00:42:50,840","00:42:53,800",I have to go and warn the others!
722,"00:42:56,000","00:42:57,760","Antidote! Antidote, please!"
723,"00:42:57,800","00:43:01,440","My stomach feels like
there's rats running around in it!"
724,"00:43:01,480","00:43:05,880","You don't deserve it, but we left it
in that little cellar downstairs."
725,"00:43:05,920","00:43:07,760",I should hurry if I were you.
726,"00:43:14,080","00:43:15,920","Me, too!"
727,"00:43:15,960","00:43:17,880","How much poison
did Maurice give them?"
728,"00:43:17,920","00:43:21,200","You mean the laxative? Lots.
Where is it?"
729,"00:43:21,240","00:43:24,400","But they should be all right if they
don't take too much of the antidote."
730,"00:43:24,440","00:43:26,840","And what did you leave down there
for the antidote?"
731,"00:43:26,880","00:43:29,520",More laxative.
732,"00:43:30,560","00:43:32,720",I've got to find a toilet!
733,"00:43:32,760","00:43:34,400",Too late.
734,"00:43:34,440","00:43:36,400",The laxative was brilliant.
735,"00:43:36,440","00:43:40,160","But giving it to them as an
antidote, as well, that is..."
736,"00:43:40,200","00:43:42,960",Clever? Narratively satisfying?
737,"00:43:43,000","00:43:44,560",Genius!
738,"00:43:44,600","00:43:46,520","The genius part is,"
739,"00:43:46,560","00:43:48,480",I know where to go next.
740,"00:43:48,520","00:43:50,240",To the forest!
741,"00:43:50,280","00:43:52,360",The Dark Wood?
742,"00:43:52,400","00:43:55,120","Well, there are trees
and it is dark."
743,"00:43:55,160","00:43:59,240","Why?
Don't you know? Don't you read?"
744,"00:43:59,280","00:44:01,720","There is only one thing
that can control a Rat King."
745,"00:44:01,760","00:44:04,120","One! In the entire landscape
of literature!"
746,"00:44:04,160","00:44:07,040","We have to get it
or all of us are in real trouble."
747,"00:44:07,080","00:44:08,720",What?
748,"00:44:08,760","00:44:12,520",The pipe of the Pied Piper.
749,"00:44:12,560","00:44:14,360",The real Pied Piper!
750,"00:44:26,720","00:44:29,480","You hear the words ""Rat King""
and you get out of there."
751,"00:44:29,520","00:44:31,360",Permanently. That's the rule.
752,"00:44:31,400","00:44:35,200","Yep! Lucky me!
And what an end to the story!"
753,"00:44:35,240","00:44:39,520","The Amazing Maurice barely escapes
with six of his nine lives."
754,"00:44:39,560","00:44:43,200","And these little beauties, of course!"
755,"00:44:43,240","00:44:47,040","Yep, huge advantage being a cat."
756,"00:44:47,080","00:44:51,880","Actually, it's too bad for them
they're not cats."
757,"00:44:53,000","00:44:56,240","Hey,
why am I even thinking about them?"
758,"00:44:56,280","00:44:59,280","I'm not feeling guilty
about this. I'm a cat!"
759,"00:44:59,320","00:45:02,800","Free to follow my own fate.
My next big adventure."
760,"00:45:02,840","00:45:04,080",I think I'll go to sea.
761,"00:45:04,120","00:45:06,640",Always fancied being a ship's cat.
762,"00:45:06,680","00:45:11,160","Might get a little bit sick,
I suppose, but I'll get used to it."
763,"00:45:11,200","00:45:14,920","What a twist!
And it's just getting better!"
764,"00:45:14,960","00:45:18,040","Malicia?
You've been up here three days!"
765,"00:45:18,080","00:45:19,880",Do you want some dinner?
766,"00:45:19,920","00:45:22,520","I'm coming down soon, Dad!
I promise!"
767,"00:45:22,560","00:45:25,200","This is not the behaviour
of a normal girl."
768,"00:45:25,240","00:45:28,320","Where were we? Oh, yes. Mr Bunnsy."

there ever was."""

what was waiting for him."""
773,"00:45:59,600","00:46:04,320","This must be it.
Ten rats in 32 seconds!"
774,"00:46:04,360","00:46:07,120","Come on, give me a hand."
775,"00:46:07,160","00:46:10,120","That's a smidgen over three seconds
per rat!"
776,"00:46:10,160","00:46:14,000","Let's hear it for
The Blitz From Bad Blintz!"
777,"00:46:14,040","00:46:18,120",Billy!
778,"00:46:18,160","00:46:21,480",Sardines is not far.

783,"00:46:42,240","00:46:44,400",to rattle?
784,"00:46:44,440","00:46:47,680",How long will they last?
785,"00:46:49,880","00:46:54,280","Oh, no! This is even worse
than Maurice told!"
786,"00:46:54,320","00:46:58,600","Sardines is dog food.
Idiots! Work together!"
787,"00:46:58,640","00:47:01,240","You could strip that fleabag
to the bone!"
788,"00:47:03,120","00:47:05,480",That was a quick one!
789,"00:47:05,520","00:47:10,000","Six rats in 28 seconds!
Good boy!"
790,"00:47:10,040","00:47:11,400","All right, folks!"
791,"00:47:11,440","00:47:15,240","For tonight's main event,
we've got a real treat for you!"
792,"00:47:15,280","00:47:18,440","You won't have seen a rat like this
before."
793,"00:47:18,480","00:47:22,480",We call him The Rat With the Hat!

You know what to do!"

Um, rubber-string... what?"
803,"00:47:59,520","00:48:02,440","You, come here! Attach the string!
Me?"

809,"00:48:26,080","00:48:28,480",Huh?
810,"00:48:28,520","00:48:32,000","Get it done!
Double the pressure, half the speed!"
811,"00:48:32,040","00:48:34,840","♪ Dip-a-doo-ba-da, boo!"
812,"00:48:34,880","00:48:38,880","What is the rat doing?
The Charleston, I think."
813,"00:48:38,920","00:48:40,960","Hurry up!
Wait!"

820,"00:48:59,400","00:49:02,520","Sardines, we'll get you out of this!"
821,"00:49:02,560","00:49:04,520",Did the rat just talk?
822,"00:49:04,560","00:49:08,000",Don't worry. Stay behind me.
823,"00:49:08,040","00:49:10,080","Don't move, I've got you! Huh?"
824,"00:49:13,000","00:49:16,760","Go on, Brute, get stuck in!"
825,"00:49:25,320","00:49:27,040",What are you waiting for?

828,"00:49:39,920","00:49:43,760","You've spent your showbusiness
career biting rats that ran away."
829,"00:49:43,800","00:49:46,920","But rats that fight back...
Huh! Huh!"
830,"00:49:46,960","00:49:49,080",..they're something new.

Mission completed!"
846,"00:51:08,920","00:51:12,160",Let's go! But stay frosty!
847,"00:51:45,320","00:51:47,920","What is that, that tune?"
848,"00:51:47,960","00:51:51,600","Huh? Oh, sorry, was feeling nervous.
It helps me..."
849,"00:51:51,640","00:51:55,920",Agh! ..if I play. Oof! Ow!
850,"00:51:55,960","00:51:58,920","Mm, it was nice."
851,"00:52:02,400","00:52:06,200","Say, do you have a princess, or
someone else you are in love with,"
852,"00:52:06,240","00:52:09,560","who might be impressed
by your heroics?"
853,"00:52:09,600","00:52:11,840","No, I do not."
854,"00:52:11,880","00:52:14,080","Oh, that's too bad,"
855,"00:52:14,120","00:52:16,360","otherwise you and I
might have been an item."
856,"00:52:16,400","00:52:20,720","How could my having someone else
mean I'm right for you?"
857,"00:52:20,760","00:52:24,440","Plot complications!
Every story needs them."
858,"00:52:26,040","00:52:28,600","If you were doing this
for someone else,"
859,"00:52:28,640","00:52:31,120","I would be the girl
right in front of you"
860,"00:52:31,160","00:52:34,600","who's obviously much better for you
but you don't see it"
861,"00:52:34,640","00:52:37,600",and you would realise in the end.
862,"00:52:37,640","00:52:41,800","But since there isn't anyone else,
I'm not that girl."
863,"00:52:43,600","00:52:45,120","Malicia,"
864,"00:52:45,160","00:52:47,280",this isn't some story.
865,"00:52:49,720","00:52:52,680","That's what everyone's been
trying to tell you."
866,"00:52:53,800","00:52:56,960","Listen, orphan boy,
who was probably a changeling fairy"
867,"00:52:57,000","00:52:59,080","and that's why you can play
amazing music,"
868,"00:52:59,120","00:53:00,920",I'll tell you something!
869,"00:53:00,960","00:53:02,960",I know about real life.
870,"00:53:03,000","00:53:04,560","I know people think I'm silly,"
871,"00:53:04,600","00:53:06,920",but you know what?
872,"00:53:06,960","00:53:09,800",Aaaggghhh!
873,"00:53:09,840","00:53:12,040","If you don't turn your life
into a story,"
874,"00:53:12,080","00:53:15,720","you become part
of someone else's story!"
875,"00:53:20,520","00:53:24,080","And what if your story
doesn't go anywhere?"
876,"00:53:24,120","00:53:26,320",But it will. It always does.
877,"00:53:26,360","00:53:28,640",It has to go somewhere.
878,"00:53:32,040","00:53:35,280",There!
879,"00:54:01,520","00:54:03,960",There he is!
880,"00:54:04,000","00:54:06,400",That's dedication!
881,"00:54:06,440","00:54:11,840","He wears his Pied Piper outfit
even in his down time."
882,"00:54:11,880","00:54:14,320",He looks...
883,"00:54:14,360","00:54:16,800",..somewhat intense!
884,"00:54:16,840","00:54:18,920","He did once get upset
about an unpaid bill"
885,"00:54:18,960","00:54:22,320","and magicked an entire town's worth
of children into the woods,"
886,"00:54:22,360","00:54:24,520",never to be found!
887,"00:54:24,560","00:54:26,920",And why did you not tell me that
888,"00:54:26,960","00:54:29,560",before now?
889,"00:54:30,560","00:54:33,440","The original fairy tales
are the best."
890,"00:54:33,480","00:54:36,680",Really quite brutal.
891,"00:54:44,640","00:54:46,240",There it is!
892,"00:54:46,280","00:54:48,560",That's the pipe!
893,"00:55:03,320","00:55:04,640","Ooh, nice!"
894,"00:55:08,360","00:55:10,280","Yep. That's it, all right."
895,"00:55:10,320","00:55:14,560","I bet he has the whole forest
under his spell."
896,"00:55:15,560","00:55:17,960",Peaches?
897,"00:55:19,360","00:55:21,680",Peaches?
898,"00:55:23,040","00:55:25,560",Peaches?

Let me smell you!"
902,"00:55:36,040","00:55:39,200","'I'm in your head.'
What? How?"
903,"00:55:39,240","00:55:42,720","'See that small tunnel
to your right?'"
904,"00:55:42,760","00:55:45,040",'Enter it.'
905,"00:55:46,360","00:55:50,400","'I'm up here, Dangerous Beans.'"

907,"00:55:52,280","00:55:57,200","Why?'Someone I think you know
is waiting for you.'"

915,"00:56:46,520","00:56:49,920","I know you better
than you might think."
916,"00:56:49,960","00:56:53,760","And, oh, the ability
to read your thoughts does help."
917,"00:56:53,800","00:56:56,440",Where is Peaches?
918,"00:56:56,480","00:56:58,000",Safe.
919,"00:56:58,040","00:56:59,600",Where is she?
920,"00:56:59,640","00:57:04,320","Safe, I said!
I'm keeping her quite close."
921,"00:57:06,760","00:57:09,920","Oh, don't be afraid!
Rather the opposite."
922,"00:57:09,960","00:57:12,480",I would like that you would join me.

926,"00:57:20,200","00:57:23,400",a mind that is thoughtful and wise.
927,"00:57:23,440","00:57:27,720","A mind that thinks for many rats,
not just one."
928,"00:57:27,760","00:57:31,960","Oh, I send them out each night
to steal food."
929,"00:57:32,000","00:57:36,240","The rats grow stronger,
the humans grow weaker."
930,"00:57:36,280","00:57:41,280",That is the answer to your mystery!
931,"00:57:41,320","00:57:47,040","Mm... One mind is only as strong
as one mind"
932,"00:57:47,080","00:57:49,760","and two minds are as strong as two,"
933,"00:57:49,800","00:57:52,160",but put three minds together...
934,"00:57:52,200","00:57:54,800",..three minds are four minds
935,"00:57:54,840","00:57:58,240",and four minds are eight minds...
936,"00:57:58,280","00:58:02,840",..AND EIGHT MINDS ARE...
937,"00:58:02,880","00:58:05,200",..one.
938,"00:58:06,280","00:58:08,960",Where is Peaches?
939,"00:58:10,720","00:58:14,000",No! Help me! Help!
940,"00:58:14,040","00:58:16,800","Peaches! Peaches, I'm here!
Help me! It's all right!"
941,"00:58:16,840","00:58:20,120","It's all right, Peaches, I'm here.
Yes. Yes."
942,"00:58:20,160","00:58:22,600",You are here.
943,"00:58:22,640","00:58:27,080","Well, we want the same things,
you and I."
944,"00:58:27,120","00:58:28,840",We have plans.
945,"00:58:28,880","00:58:33,200","We want the triumph of rats
over humans!"
946,"00:58:33,240","00:58:35,680","I harbour a somewhat
different dream."
947,"00:58:35,720","00:58:37,920","Individual rats and humans,"
948,"00:58:37,960","00:58:42,120","living together in peace,
respect and harmony."
949,"00:58:42,160","00:58:46,000",Like in a story book?
950,"00:58:47,480","00:58:51,160",Yes. Exactly like in a story book.
951,"00:58:51,200","00:58:55,160","Complete with a happy ending.
Meow!"
952,"00:58:55,200","00:58:56,880",Ugh!
953,"00:59:05,440","00:59:08,600","Oh, you want to buy your way out?"
954,"00:59:08,640","00:59:10,840","Hm, something like..."
955,"00:59:10,880","00:59:12,640",..that!
956,"00:59:18,280","00:59:23,640","Agh!
Morris! It's Maurice."
957,"00:59:23,680","00:59:25,280","Ah, you silly cat!"
958,"00:59:25,320","00:59:28,720","Let's go!
Beans! Come on!"
959,"00:59:28,760","00:59:31,840","Silly rat... Silly rat...
Silly Rat... Silly Rat..."
960,"00:59:31,880","00:59:35,520",I can force you to join me.
961,"00:59:35,560","00:59:39,360",Join me... Join... Join... Join...
962,"00:59:39,400","00:59:42,800","You'll never fit through!
I'm a cat! If my head fits,"
963,"00:59:42,840","00:59:44,840",the rest will follow!
964,"00:59:46,880","00:59:50,080","It's futile to run
when I'm in your heads!"
965,"00:59:54,320","00:59:57,920","Don't worry!
A cat always lands on its feet!"
966,"00:59:57,960","01:00:00,240","Agh!
Aaaggghhh!"
967,"01:00:02,800","01:00:04,360",Agh!
968,"01:00:04,400","01:00:07,520",Oof!
969,"01:00:07,560","01:00:08,760",Ah! Maurice!
970,"01:00:08,800","01:00:11,520",Amazing Maurice.
971,"01:00:11,560","01:00:15,760","We have to get out of here!
Get out of town! Fast!"
972,"01:00:15,800","01:00:17,560",Whoa! Oof!
973,"01:00:17,600","01:00:21,120","What about Keith and Malicia?
We're dealing with a Rat King!"
974,"01:00:21,160","01:00:23,200","A Rat King?! Oh, no!"
975,"01:00:23,240","01:00:25,640","OK, they can catch up."
976,"01:00:37,080","01:00:39,240","I'll distract him.
You grab the pipe."
977,"01:00:39,280","01:00:41,600",What? He's already asleep.
978,"01:00:41,640","01:00:44,520","Well, then, I've done my part."
979,"01:01:02,200","01:01:05,360","I didn't do it mama, I sw...
Mmmmm!"
980,"01:01:05,400","01:01:07,960",I did...
981,"01:01:20,000","01:01:22,000",Wow!
982,"01:01:22,040","01:01:23,560",Look out!
983,"01:01:23,600","01:01:25,440",Huh?
984,"01:01:27,680","01:01:30,360","I'm sorry, Mr Piper,
but I'm afraid I must insist"
985,"01:01:30,400","01:01:32,160",that you hand over that pipe.
986,"01:01:32,200","01:01:35,320","Oh, now, is that so?"
987,"01:01:35,360","01:01:36,920","Yes, that is so!"
988,"01:01:36,960","01:01:42,600","Or else I've got this
and I'm not afraid to use it!"
989,"01:01:42,640","01:01:44,680",That's a fork.
990,"01:01:44,720","01:01:47,480","A knife would be too sharp
to carry around in my bag,"
991,"01:01:47,520","01:01:49,720","so it makes sense for me
to use a fork."
992,"01:01:49,760","01:01:51,520",Sir?
993,"01:01:51,560","01:01:55,640","Did you really
steal a town full of children?"
994,"01:01:55,680","01:01:59,040","Half the things they say about me
are not true!"
995,"01:01:59,080","01:02:01,440","Well, that's a relief!
No!"
996,"01:02:01,480","01:02:04,440","He didn't say which half.
Clever girl!"
997,"01:02:04,480","01:02:09,080","And you look tasty, too! Uh-oh!
I think he just told us which half."
998,"01:02:09,120","01:02:12,680","Out to the oven, both of you!"
999,"01:02:12,720","01:02:14,640",Ugh!
1000,"01:02:14,680","01:02:18,000",I think he got us!
1001,"01:02:20,320","01:02:22,360",Whaaa? The oven?
1002,"01:02:22,400","01:02:24,880",This is so Hansel and Gretel.
1003,"01:02:27,360","01:02:29,480",Now's about the time
1004,"01:02:29,520","01:02:33,120","a character we almost forgot
will appear unexpectedly"
1005,"01:02:33,160","01:02:35,960",to pay his debt and save the day!
1006,"01:02:39,520","01:02:43,560","Looks like your story
doesn't have a happy end."
1007,"01:02:43,600","01:02:47,120","In that case, Keith,"
1008,"01:02:47,160","01:02:50,560","this would be the perfect moment
for you to confess"
1009,"01:02:50,600","01:02:53,560",how you truly feel about me.
1010,"01:02:53,600","01:02:56,320",How I truly feel about you?
1011,"01:02:56,360","01:02:57,880",Mm-hm!
1012,"01:02:59,920","01:03:02,920","Most of the time,"
1013,"01:03:02,960","01:03:05,200",fairly annoyed.
1014,"01:03:15,400","01:03:18,320",Agh!
1015,"01:03:40,000","01:03:45,880",Aaaggghhh...
1016,"01:03:49,800","01:03:53,720","I knew I could count on you,
Mr Clicky!"
1017,"01:03:53,760","01:03:55,280",We got it! Let's go!
1018,"01:03:55,320","01:03:58,400","Now they have the rare
and precious weapon"
1019,"01:03:58,440","01:04:01,920",to defeat the evil Rat King!
1020,"01:04:01,960","01:04:05,200","Everybody, hurry!
What's all the fuss about?"
1021,"01:04:05,240","01:04:07,480","A Rat King?
Well, that doesn't sound so bad."
1022,"01:04:07,520","01:04:11,200","It is, believe me.
We need to beat it pronto."
1023,"01:04:11,240","01:04:13,800",A dead end! How do we get out?
1024,"01:04:13,840","01:04:16,760","Everybody, calm down! Please!"
1025,"01:04:16,800","01:04:21,360",Quiet! I'm trying to think!
1026,"01:04:21,400","01:04:23,720",Agh!
1027,"01:04:23,760","01:04:27,160","Hey! Watch it!
You watch it!"
1028,"01:04:28,440","01:04:30,280","One rat can think, right?"
1029,"01:04:30,320","01:04:32,520","But a bunch of rats
is just a big animal"
1030,"01:04:32,560","01:04:35,520",with lots of legs and no brain.
1031,"01:04:37,320","01:04:42,080","As soon as there's trouble,
we're just... rats."
1032,"01:04:42,120","01:04:45,120","If it's any help, I'm just a cat."
1033,"01:04:45,160","01:04:47,680","Oh, you are not ""just a cat"",
Maurice."
1034,"01:04:47,720","01:04:51,080","Well, we've always wondered
how I got changed,"
1035,"01:04:51,120","01:04:54,320","even though I never ate any magical
rubbish from the wizard's dump."
1036,"01:04:54,360","01:04:55,520",Yesss?
1037,"01:04:55,560","01:04:59,080","A mystery.
Well, er, now might be the time."
1038,"01:04:59,120","01:05:01,840","Did you ever know a rat, quite big,
one ear missing,"
1039,"01:05:01,880","01:05:04,120",had a bit of a speech difficulty?
1040,"01:05:04,160","01:05:07,480","Oh, that sounds like Additives.
Right?"
1041,"01:05:07,520","01:05:09,240","Oh, no!"
1042,"01:05:09,280","01:05:12,880",All right! All right! I ate him!
1043,"01:05:15,600","01:05:18,760","I hadn't learned to think yet!
I was hungry!"
1044,"01:05:18,800","01:05:21,280","I ate him and then I got changed,
too!"
1045,"01:05:21,320","01:05:25,240","I admit it! It wasn't my fault.
I was just a cat."
1046,"01:05:25,280","01:05:27,440","Are you sorry?
Sorry?"
1047,"01:05:27,480","01:05:30,360","Cats are never sorry.
They never regret anything!"
1048,"01:05:30,400","01:05:34,240","Except... Except, I do!"
1049,"01:05:34,280","01:05:37,680","Then, it is all right. Probably."
1050,"01:05:37,720","01:05:40,920","Yo, Maurice! Give me a hand!"
1051,"01:05:45,360","01:05:48,520","Quick! Right, let's get out of here
once and for all!"
1052,"01:05:55,920","01:05:57,800","What's wrong?
There..."
1053,"01:05:57,840","01:05:59,880",Hello there!
1054,"01:05:59,920","01:06:01,640",Oh! Retreat!
1055,"01:06:01,680","01:06:06,240","Back away, everyone! Oh, please,
don't run off! You've just arrived."
1056,"01:06:06,280","01:06:09,520","Enough with the masquerade!
Show yourself!"
1057,"01:06:09,560","01:06:11,640","Oh, you want to see me?"
1058,"01:06:11,680","01:06:12,840","Well,"
1059,"01:06:12,880","01:06:16,840",here I am!
1060,"01:06:21,440","01:06:24,480",Agh!
1061,"01:06:48,040","01:06:52,960","Do you see me, white rat,
in your misty eyesight?"
1062,"01:06:54,000","01:06:58,000","Yes, you do see me."
1063,"01:07:01,920","01:07:04,840","And now, come to me,"
1064,"01:07:04,880","01:07:07,520",my little bunnies!
1065,"01:07:09,520","01:07:13,040","What is happening?
I don't know!"
1066,"01:07:17,240","01:07:18,800",Busy day?
1067,"01:07:21,160","01:07:24,360","No, come on, everyone.
You have to fight it!"
1068,"01:07:24,400","01:07:26,880",He's too strong!
1069,"01:07:26,920","01:07:29,600","Maurice, you could get away."
1070,"01:07:29,640","01:07:34,400","No! No! I-I would rather stay
and stand with my friends."
1071,"01:07:34,440","01:07:37,280","Er, no, actually,
you could probably get away. What?"
1072,"01:07:37,320","01:07:41,440","And go get help. But we still give
you credit for your noble stance."
1073,"01:07:41,480","01:07:43,080",But I...
1074,"01:07:45,480","01:07:48,720","Ah, that fluffy tail is probably
the last we'll ever see of him."
1075,"01:07:48,760","01:07:52,480","Yep.Bye-bye.Good riddance!
Ahem! Pardon me!"
1076,"01:07:52,520","01:07:55,360",Can we continue? Fine.
1077,"01:07:55,400","01:07:58,400",Come to me!
1078,"01:08:08,320","01:08:10,000","Maurice!
Keith!"
1079,"01:08:10,040","01:08:13,400","We've got the Pied Piper's pipe
and we're headed back to town."
1080,"01:08:13,440","01:08:16,480","Good! I'm off to find
Keith and Malicia"
1081,"01:08:16,520","01:08:18,760","and lead them back
to battle the Rat King!"
1082,"01:08:18,800","01:08:23,560","Yes! Go! Go! Right! Go! Go!
OK, bye!"
1083,"01:08:28,480","01:08:31,400","Yeah, let's call that
a heat-of-the-moment fail."
1084,"01:08:31,440","01:08:36,240","Yes, that never happened. Let's never
mention that, ever, to anyone."
1085,"01:08:36,280","01:08:39,840",Deal! So one more time.
1086,"01:08:39,880","01:08:41,840",Maurice! We have the pipe!
1087,"01:08:41,880","01:08:44,960","The Rat King is on the attack!
Follow me!"
1088,"01:08:50,920","01:08:53,680",Come!
1089,"01:08:53,720","01:08:55,960",COME!
1090,"01:08:57,200","01:08:59,880","Hey, watch out!
Oh, no!"
1091,"01:08:59,920","01:09:03,600","Together, we will be strong!"
1092,"01:09:03,640","01:09:05,840","Oh, no!"
1093,"01:09:05,880","01:09:07,680",I got you!
1094,"01:09:07,720","01:09:10,200","Your offer is interesting,"
1095,"01:09:10,240","01:09:12,680",but what of those who aren't strong?
1096,"01:09:15,160","01:09:17,480",Agh!
1097,"01:09:17,520","01:09:19,920","Delicious!
This tickles!"
1098,"01:09:19,960","01:09:26,640","Delicious indeed! The weak are food.
That is how it has always been."
1099,"01:09:26,680","01:09:29,120","A-ha-ha!
Things are becoming clearer."
1100,"01:09:29,160","01:09:32,400",No! Ugh! Fight him! For our lives!
1101,"01:09:32,440","01:09:34,280",For our future!
1102,"01:09:34,320","01:09:38,880","Yes, join us! I have great plans!"
1103,"01:09:38,920","01:09:43,800","You only have plans!
Well, I have dreams!"
1104,"01:09:43,840","01:09:45,480",You defy me?
1105,"01:09:45,520","01:09:47,680","Excuse me?!
What was that?"
1106,"01:09:48,880","01:09:50,480",Over here!
1107,"01:09:50,520","01:09:54,960","You?! Mayor's daughter,
ya foolish child!"
1108,"01:09:55,000","01:09:57,040",Will you please be quiet?
1109,"01:09:57,080","01:10:01,360","What? Your voice, it's so loud!
Just shut up!"
1110,"01:10:01,400","01:10:03,680",I'm trying to hear the music.

1112,"01:10:05,080","01:10:06,760",That's right. Music.

1117,"01:10:37,160","01:10:40,200","Malicia,
are you sure this is going to work?"
1118,"01:10:40,240","01:10:43,480",But of course. You just wait.
1119,"01:10:57,040","01:11:01,840","Humans...
Humans are the vermin of this world."

1122,"01:11:06,000","01:11:09,680","Humans have tortured and poisoned
and killed,"
1123,"01:11:09,720","01:11:14,280","and all of that is now given form
in me."
1124,"01:11:14,320","01:11:18,040",We must live alongside the humans!
1125,"01:11:18,080","01:11:21,360","They trap and course us

1126,"01:11:21,400","01:11:25,760","We will teach them to respect
who we are. Arrrgh!"
1127,"01:11:25,800","01:11:28,200","Oh, yes, we will."
1128,"01:11:28,240","01:11:30,560",With fear!

1144,"01:12:07,600","01:12:11,880","And we would rule
that rat world together,"

1146,"01:12:13,040","01:12:15,640",We would... co-operate.
1147,"01:12:15,680","01:12:19,280","Yeah, right!
You co-operate, he rules!"
1148,"01:12:19,320","01:12:21,920",Smart cat.
1149,"01:12:23,640","01:12:27,920","The stupid kid is making me
seriously angry!"

1152,"01:12:37,080","01:12:39,000",You obviously do not know

1157,"01:12:48,960","01:12:52,000","Now, where were we?
Oh, yes."
1158,"01:12:52,040","01:12:55,160",Join me!

1162,"01:13:03,000","01:13:07,880","I'm sorry, the pipe,
it's not working."
1163,"01:13:07,920","01:13:11,640","It's not the pipe, stupid."
1164,"01:13:11,680","01:13:12,880",Huh?
1165,"01:13:13,920","01:13:16,920",Just play.

Morris."

too."
1233,"01:18:29,440","01:18:33,160","How many lives do you have left now?
Erm..."
1234,"01:18:33,200","01:18:38,120","Lemme think. Er, six, sir! Six.
Very definitely six lives, sir."
1235,"01:18:38,160","01:18:42,440","But you were run over by a cart
only last month, weren't you?"
1236,"01:18:42,480","01:18:45,800","Oh, that, sir? No.
Buh-Barely grazed me."
1237,"01:18:45,840","01:18:49,120","Got away with hardly a scratch, sir.
Exactly."
1238,"01:18:49,160","01:18:51,800","O-Oh. Oh, I... Yeah. I see."
1239,"01:18:51,840","01:18:55,960","That makes five lives, Morris."
1240,"01:18:57,520","01:19:00,080","Sir, please,"
1241,"01:19:00,120","01:19:01,920",take two of my lives.
1242,"01:19:01,960","01:19:04,320","I would give an extra one
in exchange for the life"

1244,"01:19:06,360","01:19:12,000","That is very un-cat-like of you,
Morris. I'm amazed."
1245,"01:19:12,040","01:19:14,520","Well, I'm pretty shocked too, sir."
1246,"01:19:14,560","01:19:18,080",It's just that this one is special.
1247,"01:19:18,120","01:19:21,920",Wise and inspiring.
1248,"01:19:21,960","01:19:24,920",Your request will be granted.
1249,"01:19:24,960","01:19:28,880","We came for two lives

1251,"01:19:32,160","01:19:33,960","Thank you, sir!"
1252,"01:19:34,000","01:19:37,920","Oh, sir? I'm not gonna remember
all this, am I, sir?"
1253,"01:19:37,960","01:19:40,720","Because that would just be
too embarrassing."
1254,"01:19:40,760","01:19:42,960","Of course not, Morris."
1255,"01:19:47,720","01:19:50,160",Beans!
