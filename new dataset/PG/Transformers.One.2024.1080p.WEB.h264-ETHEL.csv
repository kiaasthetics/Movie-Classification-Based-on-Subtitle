so glad you're here."
38,"00:04:04,674","00:04:06,036",Which way is the exit?

I'm gonna smash you!"

faster. It'll be fun."

66,"00:05:45,544","00:05:48,347","Ah, it's Orion.
Seriously, again?"
67,"00:06:00,955","00:06:03,021","Okay, fellas! Thanks
for the head start."
68,"00:06:03,056","00:06:04,462",You want to give me another one?

you say, no-cog?"
72,"00:06:10,569","00:06:12,096","Sorry, sir, I didn't mean you."
73,"00:06:12,131","00:06:13,966","I was referring to the
bot who was behind you."
74,"00:06:14,001","00:06:15,473",What? Where'd he go?
75,"00:06:15,508","00:06:16,936",The filthy red and blue bot?
76,"00:06:16,971","00:06:18,905","Has a big mouth, squeaky joints,"
77,"00:06:18,940","00:06:20,610","gives off a corroded
metallic stench?"
78,"00:06:20,645","00:06:22,304",Where is he? He went that way.
79,"00:06:22,339","00:06:24,482","When I get my hands
on that bot..."
80,"00:06:33,416","00:06:35,218","All right, all clear."
81,"00:06:35,253","00:06:37,858","Okay, D-16, I may
be a little rusty,"
82,"00:06:37,893","00:06:39,530","but ""corroded""?
That is too far."
83,"00:06:39,565","00:06:41,664","Let me guess. Chased
out of the archives?"
84,"00:06:41,699","00:06:43,743","Yeah. I had to jump out
of a window this time."
85,"00:06:43,767","00:06:45,536",Almost died. It was wild.
86,"00:06:45,571","00:06:47,769","And digging through ancient
data is worth dying for?"
87,"00:06:47,804","00:06:49,133","Yes, it is."
88,"00:06:49,168","00:06:50,607",I need a new best friend.

90,"00:06:52,545","00:06:54,611","that can help locate the

the Sentinel Prime,"
93,"00:06:59,409","00:07:01,486","is up on the surface right now,"
94,"00:07:01,521","00:07:04,720","risking his life for us
in search of the Matrix."
95,"00:07:04,755","00:07:07,822","That's exactly what I'm
doing. I'm trying to help him."
96,"00:07:07,857","00:07:09,384","Yeah, okay."
97,"00:07:09,419","00:07:11,155","The sooner Energon flows again,"
98,"00:07:11,190","00:07:13,322","the sooner we won't
have to mine for it."
99,"00:07:13,357","00:07:15,676","Don't you want to choose your
own path, do whatever you want?"
100,"00:07:15,700","00:07:18,327","We're miners. We
mine, that's all."
101,"00:07:18,362","00:07:22,837","No, there has got to be something
more I can do. I can feel it."
102,"00:07:22,872","00:07:24,872","Oh, yeah? Like the time
you had a ""feeling"""
103,"00:07:24,907","00:07:26,643","you could transform
without a cog?"
104,"00:07:26,678","00:07:28,447","You said you were never
gonna mention that again."
105,"00:07:28,471","00:07:30,878","Took me three days
to pry you open."
106,"00:07:30,913","00:07:32,022","Your feelings get
you in trouble."
107,"00:07:32,046","00:07:33,551","Yeah, yeah."
108,"00:07:33,586","00:07:35,784","Just trust in Sentinel
Prime. I do trust in him."
109,"00:07:37,557","00:07:39,447","Hey, if we did have cogs..."
110,"00:07:39,482","00:07:41,724","I'd transform into a
shovel and beat you."
111,"00:07:41,759","00:07:43,660","I don't like how fast
you answered that."
112,"00:07:43,695","00:07:46,564","But listen, if you did beat me,
I couldn't give you this awesome"
113,"00:07:46,599","00:07:48,830","Megatronus Prime thing
I have here. It's cool."
114,"00:07:48,865","00:07:51,800","I'll give it to someone else.
What Megatronus Prime thing?"
115,"00:07:51,835","00:07:53,670","Ah, it's nothing.
Just a, you know,"
116,"00:07:53,705","00:07:56,970","mint-condition Megatronus
Prime decal, first edition."
117,"00:07:57,005","00:07:58,576",What?
118,"00:07:58,611","00:08:00,446","If you don't want it, I
can just throw it away."
119,"00:08:00,470","00:08:02,052","Throw it away? Don't...
That's not funny. Let me see."
120,"00:08:02,076","00:08:04,439","Wait. Don't grab.
You're gonna crease it."
121,"00:08:06,619","00:08:09,081","You know, Sentinel says
Megatronus was the..."
122,"00:08:09,116","00:08:10,984","The strongest
Prime to ever live."
123,"00:08:11,019","00:08:12,480","I know, buddy."
124,"00:08:12,515","00:08:16,660","Looks good on you.
Ah, it's really cool."
125,"00:08:18,356","00:08:20,532",Thanks. Always got your back.
126,"00:08:21,194","00:08:22,930",No matter what.
127,"00:08:26,529","00:08:29,112","Approaching sublevel station.
Stand clear of doors."
128,"00:08:29,136","00:08:31,037","Mining teams, prepare to unload."
129,"00:08:50,927","00:08:53,521","Metal to the pedal,
drill bits. This is it."
130,"00:08:53,556","00:08:55,996","How much Energon have you
mined under my leadership?"
131,"00:08:56,031","00:08:57,327","So much, Elita-1!"
132,"00:08:57,362","00:08:59,329","And how perfect is
my mining record?"
133,"00:08:59,364","00:09:00,836","So perfect, Elita-1!"
134,"00:09:00,871","00:09:03,201","We are a mere 30
units of Energon away"
135,"00:09:03,236","00:09:05,236",from my promotion to supervisor.
136,"00:09:05,271","00:09:06,809",Are you happy for me?
137,"00:09:06,844","00:09:08,206","So happy, Elita-1!"
138,"00:09:09,308","00:09:10,978","Elita... I mean Captain,"
139,"00:09:11,013","00:09:13,684","you are looking especially
shiny this morning. New polish?"
140,"00:09:13,719","00:09:15,686","Orion Pax, I'm
sorry that I somehow"
141,"00:09:15,721","00:09:17,479","gave you the impression
that we're friends."
142,"00:09:17,514","00:09:18,953",Apology accepted.
143,"00:09:18,988","00:09:20,691","Light up that wall!
Let's go! Ten seconds!"
144,"00:09:20,726","00:09:22,319","Happy to take the
lead today, Captain."
145,"00:09:22,354","00:09:23,958","Feeling like I have
enough power in me"
146,"00:09:23,993","00:09:25,861","to drill down and
touch Primus myself."
147,"00:09:25,896","00:09:27,522","You don't have the
touch or the power."
148,"00:09:27,557","00:09:29,733","Ready positions, rust
buckets! Let's go!"
149,"00:09:29,768","00:09:31,669","She's in a good
mood today. Mm-hmm."
150,"00:09:31,704","00:09:33,396",You ready? Always ready.
151,"00:09:33,431","00:09:35,035",Let's punch in.
152,"00:09:35,070","00:09:36,751","Here we go. This one
won't be open long."
153,"00:09:36,775","00:09:38,071",Brace it up!
154,"00:09:38,678","00:09:41,008",Here we go! Bridge!
155,"00:09:41,043","00:09:42,240",Brace up!
156,"00:09:43,683","00:09:45,584",Lower channel is open.

161,"00:10:08,202","00:10:10,433","It's unstable! We got
to go, we got to move!"
162,"00:10:17,882","00:10:19,475",Evacuate!
163,"00:10:21,413","00:10:23,083","Everyone out!
Evacuate immediately!"
164,"00:10:23,118","00:10:24,755",The tunnel is closing.
165,"00:10:24,790","00:10:27,758","I repeat, the tunnel is closing!"
166,"00:10:27,793","00:10:30,926","You with me, D? On
your six! Keep going!"
167,"00:10:31,731","00:10:32,895",Look out!
168,"00:10:37,066","00:10:38,263",Jazz is stuck!
169,"00:10:38,298","00:10:39,440","Elita, we've got
a trapped miner."
170,"00:10:39,464","00:10:41,299",I'm falling back to assist.
171,"00:10:41,334","00:10:43,081","Negative. Do not break
protocol. Evacuate!"
172,"00:10:43,105","00:10:45,204",We're gonna need more lift.
173,"00:10:45,239","00:10:47,569","It's closing! Just
grab your pack and go."
174,"00:10:47,604","00:10:48,812",Yeah. Good idea.
175,"00:10:48,847","00:10:51,144","What? No, I didn't mean it!"
176,"00:10:54,413","00:10:55,786",Pull him clear!
177,"00:11:00,023","00:11:01,583","Pax, what's happening?"
178,"00:11:01,618","00:11:04,289","Nothing much. Just normal
protocol-following stuff."
179,"00:11:04,324","00:11:05,895",It's all good.
180,"00:11:05,930","00:11:09,228","Oh, that's not good."
181,"00:11:09,263","00:11:11,802","Orion Pax, could you please
exit the tunnel of death?"
182,"00:11:11,837","00:11:13,903","Elita, it's about to
get messy out there!"
183,"00:11:19,471","00:11:21,042","Go, go, go!"
184,"00:11:24,641","00:11:25,849",Run! Run!
185,"00:11:25,884","00:11:27,675","Hurry! We're not
gonna make it!"
186,"00:11:27,710","00:11:29,787","Come on! Go, go, go!"
187,"00:11:36,554","00:11:38,653","What the hell, Pax? I
told you to evacuate."
188,"00:11:38,688","00:11:41,227","I did, eventually. If I
get fired because of you..."
189,"00:11:41,262","00:11:43,196","Oh, please. They're
not gonna fire you."
190,"00:11:44,199","00:11:45,627","Elita-1, you're fired."
191,"00:11:45,662","00:11:48,696","What? Why? I followed
protocol to the letter."
192,"00:11:48,731","00:11:50,632","That is true. I was the
one who broke the rules."
193,"00:11:50,667","00:11:52,304",No one asked you!
194,"00:11:52,339","00:11:54,603","Darkwing, please, I've
worked too hard for this."
195,"00:11:54,638","00:11:57,672","You are no-cog bots
with limited options."
196,"00:11:57,707","00:12:00,345","Report to waste
management immediately."
197,"00:12:00,380","00:12:02,017",Waste management?
198,"00:12:02,052","00:12:04,019","Elita... Next time, why
don't you stop and think"
199,"00:12:04,054","00:12:05,548",before you ruin someone's life?
200,"00:12:05,583","00:12:06,714",I'm sorry!
201,"00:12:08,421","00:12:10,091","Hey, Darkwing! Don't do it."
202,"00:12:10,126","00:12:13,325","I may not have a cog, but
my finger can transform."
203,"00:12:13,360","00:12:16,262","Guess which one? I'll give
you a ""limited option."""
204,"00:12:18,695","00:12:19,903","Excuse me, sir."
205,"00:12:19,938","00:12:21,806",Allow me.
206,"00:12:21,841","00:12:24,237","I apologize on his
behalf for the..."
207,"00:12:24,272","00:12:26,778",Why?
208,"00:12:39,584","00:12:42,651",That really hurt.
209,"00:12:42,686","00:12:44,191",What'd you expect? He's metal.
210,"00:12:44,226","00:12:45,863","You know you were out of line,"
211,"00:12:45,898","00:12:48,096","talking back to a
superior like that."
212,"00:12:48,131","00:12:50,263","Darkwing was out of
line. He deserves it."
213,"00:12:52,102","00:12:54,564","Aren't you tired of being
treated like we're nothing?"
214,"00:12:55,633","00:12:59,008","He had every right to
hit me. I interfered."
215,"00:13:00,979","00:13:03,738","Hey, and I appreciate
you having my back."
216,"00:13:05,082","00:13:06,851",I'm glad you were there with me
217,"00:13:06,886","00:13:08,457","to get punched in the
face. That was fun."
218,"00:13:08,481","00:13:10,679","Anytime, buddy."
219,"00:13:10,714","00:13:12,582","Attention, all sectors."
220,"00:13:12,617","00:13:15,717","Stand by for a live transmission
from Sentinel Prime."
221,"00:13:15,752","00:13:18,621","He's back? He's back already?
Maybe he found the Matrix."
222,"00:13:22,693","00:13:25,199","Is it on? Okay, thank you."
223,"00:13:25,234","00:13:27,036","Hello, my friends."
224,"00:13:27,071","00:13:28,598","Hello, Iacon City!"
225,"00:13:28,633","00:13:31,238","Hello to our saviors,
the industrious miners"
226,"00:13:31,273","00:13:34,241","who toil selflessly to
maintain our Energon reserves."
227,"00:13:34,276","00:13:37,178",I celebrate you.
228,"00:13:37,213","00:13:40,544","Humility and presence!
That's leadership!"
229,"00:13:40,579","00:13:42,513",Ah! Nobody does it better!
230,"00:13:42,548","00:13:45,285","Once again, I have narrowly
returned with my fleet"
231,"00:13:45,320","00:13:46,957","after another
treacherous expedition"
232,"00:13:46,992","00:13:50,323","across the desolate, dangerous
surface of our planet."
233,"00:13:50,358","00:13:52,864","I departed with hopes of finding
the Matrix of Leadership,"
234,"00:13:52,899","00:13:55,064","the key to bringing
balance to Cybertron."
235,"00:13:55,099","00:13:57,099",I regret to inform you
236,"00:13:57,134","00:13:58,496","that we've returned
empty-handed."
237,"00:13:59,796","00:14:03,138","This is a setback,
but not a failure."
238,"00:14:03,173","00:14:06,174","Rest assured, I will find
the Matrix of Leadership,"
239,"00:14:06,209","00:14:08,638",so that Energon can flow again.
240,"00:14:08,673","00:14:10,442",But that's in the future.
241,"00:14:10,477","00:14:13,742","Right now, I think we
all deserve a little fun!"
242,"00:14:13,777","00:14:16,283","Tomorrow, there will be
no work. All shifts off"
243,"00:14:16,318","00:14:19,990","because tomorrow
is the Iacon 5000!"
244,"00:14:20,025","00:14:23,323",Whoo! Whoo-hoo!
245,"00:14:23,358","00:14:24,819",My favorite event.
246,"00:14:24,854","00:14:27,855","A high-octane race
all across Iacon City."
247,"00:14:27,890","00:14:32,134","Let's all see which competitor can prove
they are truly more than meets the eye."
248,"00:14:40,738","00:14:41,770",D.
249,"00:14:42,344","00:14:44,542","Psst! Hey, D."
250,"00:14:53,157","00:14:55,421","Oh, good, you're up.
Come on, I have an idea."
251,"00:14:55,456","00:14:58,358","Whatever this is,
it better be good."
252,"00:14:58,393","00:15:00,063","Yeah, yeah, yeah,
yeah. Okay. Listen."
253,"00:15:00,098","00:15:02,164","All right, what
if... what if..."
254,"00:15:02,199","00:15:04,661",what if tomorrow
255,"00:15:04,696","00:15:08,500","we ran in the Iacon 5000, huh?"
256,"00:15:09,536","00:15:11,470","What if kill you
for waking me up?"
257,"00:15:11,505","00:15:13,208","No, no, no, hear me out."
258,"00:15:13,243","00:15:14,671",We don't even have to win!
259,"00:15:14,706","00:15:16,057","Oh, that's good,
because we wouldn't."
260,"00:15:16,081","00:15:19,247","But... But if we beat
just one Transformer,"
261,"00:15:19,282","00:15:21,249","it proves we're just
as good as they are."
262,"00:15:21,284","00:15:23,383","Not only would we
go down in history,"
263,"00:15:23,418","00:15:26,716","the mining bots that
did the impossible,"
264,"00:15:26,751","00:15:28,586","but we would show
everyone that we're..."
265,"00:15:28,621","00:15:30,654",we're capable of so much more!
266,"00:15:30,689","00:15:31,996",Or we get publicly humiliated
267,"00:15:32,031","00:15:33,723","and then busted
back to tier one."
268,"00:15:33,758","00:15:36,660","Yeah, but at least we would've
done something, you know?"
269,"00:15:36,695","00:15:38,299","Pax... Come on, D."
270,"00:15:38,334","00:15:39,762",Pax.
271,"00:15:39,797","00:15:42,633","We're mining bots
who can't transform."
272,"00:15:42,668","00:15:45,867","We can't fly, we can't roll,"
273,"00:15:45,902","00:15:47,209",we can't race.
274,"00:15:47,244","00:15:48,276","Come on, let's go."
275,"00:15:49,807","00:15:51,279","All right, fine."
276,"00:15:51,314","00:15:53,017","Yeah, maybe you're right."
277,"00:15:57,782","00:15:59,089",Maybe.
278,"00:16:00,752","00:16:03,654",The Iacon 5000 is finally here!
279,"00:16:03,689","00:16:05,238","I have a surprise
for you. Come on."
280,"00:16:05,262","00:16:07,427","Where are you going?
The stadium's that way."
281,"00:16:07,462","00:16:09,099","Yeah, yeah, I know. Follow me."
282,"00:16:09,134","00:16:11,200","Great. We're
gonna be late now."
283,"00:16:11,235","00:16:13,334",I wanted good seats.
284,"00:16:13,369","00:16:16,205","We came all this way to miss the
opening ceremony. This is wonderful!"
285,"00:16:16,240","00:16:17,976","Trust me, I know what I'm doing."
286,"00:16:18,836","00:16:20,044",Hold up!
287,"00:16:23,346","00:16:26,743","Get caught in one of those, it'll
launch you halfway across the city."
288,"00:16:26,778","00:16:28,349","Okay, where are you taking me?"
289,"00:16:30,254","00:16:32,749","Don't be a glitch, this will
be totally worth it. Trust me."
290,"00:16:32,784","00:16:34,091","Hey, you don't be a glitch."
291,"00:16:34,126","00:16:35,785","Look, I know this is,
like, fun for you,"
292,"00:16:35,820","00:16:37,358","like, we're joking around,"
293,"00:16:37,393","00:16:39,954","but if you make me miss
any part of the Iacon 5000,"
294,"00:16:39,989","00:16:43,529","I swear I will smelt your
face right off your..."
295,"00:16:46,237","00:16:50,305","Welcome to the Iacon
5000. There they are."
296,"00:16:50,340","00:16:55,607","Put your hands together as today's
competitors are taking the field."
297,"00:16:55,642","00:16:58,577","Look! There's
Thunderglide and Behemoth!"
298,"00:16:58,612","00:17:02,251","This is unbelievable! I
feel like I'm in the race!"
299,"00:17:04,849","00:17:07,014",You did this for me?
300,"00:17:07,049","00:17:08,125",No.
301,"00:17:08,160","00:17:10,127",I did this for us.
302,"00:17:14,595","00:17:17,662","And now the moment you've
all been waiting for."
303,"00:17:17,697","00:17:19,400",The icon of Iacon!
304,"00:17:20,337","00:17:22,535",The savior of Cybertron!
305,"00:17:22,570","00:17:26,143","Quintessons fear
him, but we love him!"
306,"00:17:26,178","00:17:29,311","Our leader, the one and only..."
307,"00:17:29,346","00:17:31,115",Sentinel Prime!
308,"00:17:31,150","00:17:32,710","I love you, Sentinel!"
309,"00:17:35,011","00:17:39,123","Yes! It feels so good to
be here with you all today."
310,"00:17:42,557","00:17:45,657","My friends. My
Cybertronian family."
311,"00:17:46,858","00:17:49,023",It has been precisely 50 cycles
312,"00:17:49,058","00:17:51,564","since the Quintessons
attacked our home."
313,"00:17:51,599","00:17:55,106","Fifty cycles since we lost
the Matrix of Leadership"
314,"00:17:55,141","00:17:57,735",and our Energon supply dried up.
315,"00:17:57,770","00:18:01,805","Fifty cycles since the battle
that killed the other Primes,"
316,"00:18:01,840","00:18:03,774",my brothers and sisters in arms.
317,"00:18:03,809","00:18:08,009","Today we honor the Primes
who gave their lives for ours"
318,"00:18:08,044","00:18:11,716","and we show them that the strength of
Cybertron will never be diminished."
319,"00:18:15,953","00:18:18,558","Racers, on your marks!"
320,"00:18:23,367","00:18:26,203","I can't believe we get to
watch from the starting line."
321,"00:18:26,238","00:18:28,733",The best seats in the house!
322,"00:18:28,768","00:18:29,833",Why'd you bring jetpacks?
323,"00:18:29,868","00:18:31,571",Get set!
324,"00:18:31,606","00:18:34,376","It's time to show them we
are more than meets the eye."
325,"00:18:34,411","00:18:35,773","Oh, no."
326,"00:18:37,546","00:18:38,842",And they're off!
327,"00:18:45,323","00:18:47,884","Are you crazy?
Sure feels like it."
328,"00:18:49,789","00:18:52,889",The Iacon 5000 has begun!
329,"00:18:55,201","00:18:57,762","I'm sorry, are those
miners in the race?"
330,"00:18:57,797","00:19:00,204","Miners! Those are
miners, like us!"
331,"00:19:00,239","00:19:03,097","I can't believe what I'm seeing
here! Miners trying to run"
332,"00:19:03,132","00:19:04,813","in the Iacon 5000! You've
got to be kidding me."
333,"00:19:04,837","00:19:06,903",This is insane!
334,"00:19:06,938","00:19:09,543","There are miners in
the race! Miners?"
335,"00:19:09,578","00:19:10,786","No way! They can't
even transform!"
336,"00:19:10,810","00:19:12,612",It's Orion Pax and D-16!
337,"00:19:15,749","00:19:19,014","This is a first in
Iacon 5000 history."
338,"00:19:19,049","00:19:21,115",How are they going to survive?
339,"00:19:23,526","00:19:25,988","If we survive this,
I'm gonna kill you!"
340,"00:19:26,023","00:19:27,462",I accept those terms.
341,"00:19:32,865","00:19:35,833","It's Tailwind pulling into
the lead down the main stretch"
342,"00:19:35,868","00:19:38,605",followed by Strafe and Skyfire!
343,"00:19:40,136","00:19:41,608","Hey, look out!"
344,"00:19:44,173","00:19:46,712","I owe you one. More
like a thousand."
345,"00:19:49,178","00:19:50,914","I can't believe we're
not in last place!"
346,"00:19:53,787","00:19:55,985","Eat it, miner!"
347,"00:19:56,020","00:19:58,988","Darkwing delivers a
devastating blow! Gotcha!"
348,"00:20:05,898","00:20:08,162","We're not fast
enough! Improvise!"
349,"00:20:13,576","00:20:16,280","- Hey! Get off!
- Spinout! Big fan!"
350,"00:20:16,315","00:20:18,755","Hey! Jetstorm, I'm
so sorry. Big fan!"
351,"00:20:19,516","00:20:21,175",Get off!
352,"00:20:32,529","00:20:34,221",Time it just right!
353,"00:20:34,256","00:20:36,091",And... now!
354,"00:20:37,567","00:20:38,896",Move!
355,"00:20:42,066","00:20:45,166","And the miners have
fallen way behind."
356,"00:20:45,201","00:20:48,037","We can now focus on the real
contenders in this race."
357,"00:21:05,694","00:21:09,333","I don't believe it! The
miners take down Darkwing!"
358,"00:21:10,567","00:21:12,028","Oh, miners!"
359,"00:21:12,063","00:21:13,766","Great effort, Darkwing!"
360,"00:21:13,801","00:21:15,603","That worked! It
actually worked!"
361,"00:21:15,638","00:21:17,770","Is this the dumbest
thing we've ever done?"
362,"00:21:17,805","00:21:19,310","Oh, yeah, it's up there!"
363,"00:21:26,110","00:21:27,241","No, no, no!"
364,"00:21:28,750","00:21:29,782",Whoa!
365,"00:21:33,392","00:21:34,622",Wait!
366,"00:21:34,657","00:21:35,854","Go, go, go!"
367,"00:21:38,155","00:21:40,133","A four-bot pileup in
the magnetic tunnel"
368,"00:21:40,157","00:21:43,433","and the two miners are
now in first position!"
369,"00:21:43,468","00:21:46,403",This is unbelievable!
370,"00:21:50,299","00:21:51,804",Ah!
371,"00:21:51,839","00:21:53,168",D!
372,"00:21:53,203","00:21:55,170",No. Go. Leave me!
373,"00:21:55,205","00:21:57,480","No, we do this together."
374,"00:21:57,515","00:21:59,581","One miner is now
carrying the other"
375,"00:21:59,616","00:22:01,946",mere steps from the finish line
376,"00:22:01,981","00:22:05,719","in the most amazing, sensational,
dramatic, heartrending, exciting,"
377,"00:22:05,754","00:22:07,688","thrilling finish in
the history of..."
378,"00:22:11,595","00:22:13,463",We have a winner!
379,"00:22:13,498","00:22:16,598","Chromia comes from
behind to take the prize."
380,"00:22:16,633","00:22:18,963","Talk about an Iacon
5000 for the ages."
381,"00:22:21,000","00:22:22,736","Well, second place
is still pretty good."
382,"00:22:26,742","00:22:29,743","Paging Dr. Ratchet.
Dr. Ratchet to Medical Bay 94."
383,"00:22:29,778","00:22:31,844","Do not worry. You will
be fixed up in no time."
384,"00:22:31,879","00:22:34,143",Did I win?
385,"00:22:34,178","00:22:35,782",You participated.
386,"00:22:35,817","00:22:37,080",Yay!
387,"00:22:38,886","00:22:40,688",So...
388,"00:22:40,723","00:22:42,855","how long do you
think we'll be here?"
389,"00:22:42,890","00:22:44,120",I'm not talking to you.
390,"00:22:49,292","00:22:51,325","You know what? I can't
believe you made me do that."
391,"00:22:51,360","00:22:53,800","We are so screwed! Thought
you weren't talking to me."
392,"00:22:53,835","00:22:56,935","Hey, look, I know it's all a
big joke to you. But not me."
393,"00:22:56,970","00:22:59,168","I was paying my dues.
I was going places."
394,"00:22:59,203","00:23:00,543","And now they're
gonna bust me down"
395,"00:23:00,578","00:23:02,017","I... I don't even
know how many tiers!"
396,"00:23:02,041","00:23:03,810","I'm sorry, D."
397,"00:23:03,845","00:23:05,548","But come on, didn't you feel it?"
398,"00:23:05,583","00:23:07,649","Even for just a second,
didn't you feel liberated?"
399,"00:23:07,684","00:23:09,288","Didn't you feel like
you were something else?"
400,"00:23:09,312","00:23:12,148","Like you could be more
than what they say you are?"
401,"00:23:12,183","00:23:14,854","Yeah, I felt it. I did."
402,"00:23:16,088","00:23:17,527",But it doesn't matter.
403,"00:23:17,562","00:23:19,892","We're going to get
punished and demoted."
404,"00:23:19,927","00:23:22,994","Sentinel Prime saw
the whole thing."
405,"00:23:23,029","00:23:25,260",This is so embarrassing.
406,"00:23:39,078","00:23:40,078",It's clear.
407,"00:23:44,017","00:23:45,379",Orion Pax.
408,"00:23:46,151","00:23:47,854",D-16.
409,"00:23:47,889","00:23:49,493",What you two did today
410,"00:23:49,528","00:23:52,089","was one of the craziest
things I've ever seen."
411,"00:23:52,124","00:23:54,597","Sir, this is all my
idea, and we're so sorry."
412,"00:23:54,632","00:23:56,027",I loved it!
413,"00:23:56,062","00:23:57,094",You did?
414,"00:23:57,129","00:23:58,964",How could anyone not love it?
415,"00:23:58,999","00:24:01,736","You gave my best racers a
real run for their money."
416,"00:24:01,771","00:24:04,134",So we're not getting demoted?
417,"00:24:04,169","00:24:05,333",Demoted?
418,"00:24:10,109","00:24:11,438",Demoted.
419,"00:24:12,749","00:24:14,441",What is happening?
420,"00:24:17,083","00:24:19,259","The fact of the matter is we're
halfway into the first shift"
421,"00:24:19,283","00:24:24,627","since the race ended and that mining
crew has already reached 150% quota."
422,"00:24:24,662","00:24:26,761","You inspired them
to work harder!"
423,"00:24:26,796","00:24:28,862","Sentinel Prime, sir,"
424,"00:24:28,897","00:24:33,130","we joined the race to show
everyone our potential."
425,"00:24:33,165","00:24:35,066","That we bots can do
more than just mine..."
426,"00:24:35,101","00:24:38,399","Outstanding! I love a bot
that can think for himself."
427,"00:24:38,434","00:24:40,137","Perhaps you two
could tour the mines,"
428,"00:24:40,172","00:24:42,447","speak to your brethren, and
help them see their potential."
429,"00:24:42,471","00:24:44,581","Wow! Okay, great."
430,"00:24:44,616","00:24:46,374",That sounds incredible.
431,"00:24:46,409","00:24:48,277","I would love to...
Sir, it's time."
432,"00:24:48,312","00:24:49,916","Ah, yes."
433,"00:24:49,951","00:24:51,588","I'm sorry, friends."
434,"00:24:51,623","00:24:53,656","We're preparing our next
travel to the surface."
435,"00:24:53,691","00:24:56,450","But in the meantime,
I've got a treat for you."
436,"00:24:56,485","00:24:59,596","Hang tight. Airachnid, have
someone escort these heroes"
437,"00:24:59,631","00:25:01,455","to my personal
service facilities."
438,"00:25:02,326","00:25:04,458",Best care in Iacon.
439,"00:25:04,493","00:25:06,295","Until next time, legends."
440,"00:25:10,103","00:25:14,072","Sentinel Prime.
The Sentinel Prime!"
441,"00:25:14,107","00:25:16,173","You still mad at me?
I am less mad at you."
442,"00:25:16,208","00:25:18,824","I'm telling you, D... I got a feeling
that everything's gonna change"
443,"00:25:18,848","00:25:19,990",and we're gonna go...
444,"00:25:20,014","00:25:22,817",Miners!
445,"00:25:23,347","00:25:25,886","Hi, Darkwing."
446,"00:25:26,955","00:25:29,450","- Oh, no, no, no.
- No!"
447,"00:25:31,355","00:25:33,025","Wait, wait! You
don't understand!"
448,"00:25:33,060","00:25:35,522","We were supposed to go to
Sentinel Prime's service pod!"
449,"00:25:35,557","00:25:38,833","You two dolts aren't going
to see anyone ever again."
450,"00:25:38,868","00:25:40,329",I'll make sure of that.
451,"00:25:40,364","00:25:42,639","You're making a
mistake! Ask Sentinel!"
452,"00:25:42,674","00:25:44,773",I hate that guy!
453,"00:25:58,547","00:26:00,316",You! How did you get down here?
454,"00:26:00,351","00:26:02,054",There's no access to this level.
455,"00:26:02,089","00:26:04,089","There is nobody
down here but me."
456,"00:26:04,124","00:26:06,630","Oh, my gosh, you're real!"
457,"00:26:06,665","00:26:09,864","You're others!
You're not... me!"
458,"00:26:09,899","00:26:12,603","You're here, and you're not me!"
459,"00:26:14,871","00:26:16,838","Uh, yeah. Awesome!"
460,"00:26:16,873","00:26:19,335","I am so sorry. That must
have been weird for you."
461,"00:26:19,370","00:26:21,535","I just haven't had
a lot of company"
462,"00:26:21,570","00:26:23,647","since they put me down
here in sublevel 50."
463,"00:26:23,682","00:26:26,914","Fifty? But there are
only 40 sublevels."
464,"00:26:26,949","00:26:28,575",That's what I thought!
465,"00:26:28,610","00:26:31,545","Turns out there are ten more,
and they are not pleasant."
466,"00:26:31,580","00:26:33,327","Probably why nobody ever
really talks about them."
467,"00:26:33,351","00:26:34,724","How long have you
been down here?"
468,"00:26:34,759","00:26:36,385",How long have I been here?
469,"00:26:36,420","00:26:39,586","Let's see, somewhere between
a long time and forever?"
470,"00:26:39,621","00:26:43,326","I mean, I had other jobs,
but I kept getting reassigned"
471,"00:26:43,361","00:26:45,196",'cause I'm so good at what I do.
472,"00:26:45,231","00:26:48,232","Oh! I'm B-127, by the way."
473,"00:26:48,267","00:26:49,706",But you can call me B.
474,"00:26:49,741","00:26:51,378","And I'm actually working
on some nicknames."
475,"00:26:51,402","00:26:54,073","The one I'm floating
right now is Badassatron."
476,"00:26:54,108","00:26:57,846","Which is actually
pronounced... ""Badassatron."""
477,"00:26:57,881","00:26:59,210",But if you have any critiques...
478,"00:26:59,245","00:27:02,213","Yeah, great. How do
we get out of here?"
479,"00:27:02,248","00:27:04,149",Great question. You don't.
480,"00:27:04,184","00:27:05,755",We don't? Nope.
481,"00:27:05,790","00:27:08,054","We have limited access to
the waste management area,"
482,"00:27:08,089","00:27:12,124","but the new shift manager there
does not like distractions."
483,"00:27:12,159","00:27:15,160","No, they prefer we stay
here on the task at hand."
484,"00:27:15,195","00:27:16,733",Which is? Oh!
485,"00:27:16,768","00:27:19,670","The scrap comes in
from the chute there"
486,"00:27:19,705","00:27:21,463",onto the conveyor belt.
487,"00:27:21,498","00:27:24,400","Our job is to look for anything
that might be worth salvaging"
488,"00:27:24,435","00:27:27,106","before it hits the
furnace and gets smelted."
489,"00:27:27,141","00:27:29,141",So you watch garbage burn.
490,"00:27:29,176","00:27:30,637",Yes!
491,"00:27:30,672","00:27:32,276","It is so great that
you're here now."
492,"00:27:32,311","00:27:34,179","I can't wait to learn
everything about you."
493,"00:27:34,214","00:27:36,016","And then tell you
everything about me!"
494,"00:27:36,051","00:27:38,920","I have a lot of hopes and dreams
that I am just dying to share"
495,"00:27:38,955","00:27:40,251","with one or two
new best friends."
496,"00:27:40,286","00:27:42,451","Uh, yeah, I would love to..."
497,"00:27:42,486","00:27:44,123",Where are my manners?
498,"00:27:44,158","00:27:45,938","Come on, I'll introduce you
to the rest of the crew."
499,"00:27:45,962","00:27:47,929","Hey, guys, we've got company!"
500,"00:27:49,163","00:27:51,735","This is EP-508,"
501,"00:27:51,770","00:27:55,497","this is A-A-Tron, and
this fella here is Steve."
502,"00:27:55,532","00:27:57,906","""Steve""? Yeah, he's foreign."
503,"00:27:57,941","00:27:59,875",Do they talk back to you?
504,"00:27:59,910","00:28:02,174","Um, they're not real."
505,"00:28:02,209","00:28:04,814","Jeez, you think I'm that crazy?"
506,"00:28:04,849","00:28:06,277","It's just you've
been down here a..."
507,"00:28:06,312","00:28:07,861","No, I was talking to Steve."
508,"00:28:09,348","00:28:10,479",Classic Steve.
509,"00:28:10,514","00:28:12,283","What is that?
Look at this guy."
510,"00:28:12,318","00:28:15,319",It's coming from inside.
511,"00:28:15,959","00:28:17,827",Oh! Steve! No!
512,"00:28:17,862","00:28:21,028","I am so sorry. Steve, no!"
513,"00:28:21,063","00:28:23,129","We can fix it, don't
worry. My Steve!"
514,"00:28:25,969","00:28:28,035",Quintesson ambush!
515,"00:28:28,070","00:28:31,170","Calling the High Guard for immediate
support. Immediate support!"
516,"00:28:31,843","00:28:33,436",That's Alpha Trion.
517,"00:28:33,471","00:28:34,976",One of the Primes?
518,"00:28:35,011","00:28:37,308","Repeat, Zeta Prime has fallen!"
519,"00:28:37,343","00:28:40,146","It's an SOS message.
Protect the Matrix!"
520,"00:28:40,181","00:28:43,413","Sending location coordinates.
Sending location coordinates."
521,"00:28:46,924","00:28:49,320",Holy Primus!
522,"00:28:49,355","00:28:52,620","Those are coordinates to
a location on the surface."
523,"00:28:52,655","00:28:57,229","This could be where the Primes
died in the Quintesson war."
524,"00:28:57,264","00:29:00,661","Which means this is
where we could find"
525,"00:29:00,696","00:29:03,004",the Matrix of Leadership.
526,"00:29:03,039","00:29:06,535","What are you talking about? It's an old
beacon inside a statue made of garbage."
527,"00:29:06,570","00:29:08,174","Or it's a clue of
how we could find"
528,"00:29:08,209","00:29:10,946","the Matrix of Leadership.
No. No way. Absolutely not!"
529,"00:29:10,981","00:29:13,751","Hey, D, come on, this could be our
chance to show everyone we're not..."
530,"00:29:13,775","00:29:15,181","You already tried
to ""show everyone"""
531,"00:29:15,216","00:29:16,721","in the race you tricked
me into running,"
532,"00:29:16,745","00:29:18,085",which got us stuck down here
533,"00:29:18,120","00:29:20,516","in this waste hole
with this, uh..."
534,"00:29:21,750","00:29:23,453",really cool guy.
535,"00:29:23,488","00:29:25,686","Oh, thank you.
I'm just saying..."
536,"00:29:25,721","00:29:27,490","There's a reason no one
goes to the surface."
537,"00:29:27,525","00:29:29,228",It's dangerous!
538,"00:29:29,263","00:29:31,593","I'm waiting right here until
Sentinel Prime finds us."
539,"00:29:31,628","00:29:33,463","Oh, okay. Yeah. Hmm."
540,"00:29:33,498","00:29:36,532","Well, we'll just stay here
forever. That cool with you, B?"
541,"00:29:36,567","00:29:37,940",Forever? This is great!
542,"00:29:37,975","00:29:40,173","I have new coworkers
and roommates."
543,"00:29:40,208","00:29:42,109","There's plenty of room
now that Steve is dead."
544,"00:29:42,144","00:29:44,254","I usually sleep on the conveyor
belt, but you can totally have it."
545,"00:29:44,278","00:29:45,783","I'll sleep in the
corner next to A-A-Tron."
546,"00:29:45,807","00:29:47,510","Plenty of room for you
to stretch out, too,"
547,"00:29:47,545","00:29:49,919","'cause you're taller than
I am. Know what I mean?"
548,"00:29:49,954","00:29:54,022","Hey, D, what do you think Sentinel's reaction
would be if you personally handed him"
549,"00:29:54,057","00:29:56,992","the Matrix of Leadership
that you found?"
550,"00:29:57,027","00:29:59,896","Okay, stop. I know what
you're trying to do."
551,"00:29:59,931","00:30:02,162","And it's definitely
working. I'm in."
552,"00:30:02,197","00:30:04,692","Hah, ha! Yeah, buddy. How
do we get to the surface?"
553,"00:30:04,727","00:30:06,870","Pfft! You kidding
me? The surface?"
554,"00:30:06,905","00:30:09,004",Easy. I know a way.
555,"00:30:10,172","00:30:11,765",But it won't be easy.
556,"00:30:12,735","00:30:14,735","Why is there so
much trash? Ah!"
557,"00:30:14,770","00:30:17,111","Warn me next time,
please. My mouth was open."
558,"00:30:17,146","00:30:19,608",Only 49 sublevels to go!
559,"00:30:20,677","00:30:22,776","Waste-disposal trains
are the only vehicles"
560,"00:30:22,811","00:30:24,954","that go all the
way to the surface."
561,"00:30:24,989","00:30:27,429","Yeah, but they don't allow
passengers. The trains are autonomous."
562,"00:30:27,453","00:30:29,816","Yeah, that's the
""won't be easy"" part."
563,"00:30:29,851","00:30:32,291","It's perfect. We'll be
safe inside the train."
564,"00:30:39,762","00:30:41,402","That's the last
one. Send 'er up!"
565,"00:30:46,670","00:30:49,143",Hold up! One more.
566,"00:30:53,215","00:30:54,511",I'll lock it down.
567,"00:31:02,587","00:31:05,819","Thanks for being an
idiot, whoever you are."
568,"00:31:05,854","00:31:08,965","Turning you in will definitely get
me promoted back up a rank or two."
569,"00:31:09,000","00:31:11,000",Got her!
570,"00:31:11,035","00:31:12,199","No, wait, I..."
571,"00:31:12,234","00:31:13,530",Elita! Stop!
572,"00:31:13,565","00:31:15,334","Orion? Hold on, let me..."
573,"00:31:15,369","00:31:16,566",Security! Sound the ala...
574,"00:31:22,904","00:31:24,944","She's headed to the engine!
Don't worry, I got this."
575,"00:31:27,018","00:31:29,216","Hold on, let me explain!
We're on a mission!"
576,"00:31:29,251","00:31:31,383",So am I. To ruin your life.
577,"00:31:41,923","00:31:45,001","Elita, wait. We found a
message. We know where..."
578,"00:31:45,729","00:31:47,861",This bot is crazy! Who is she?
579,"00:31:47,896","00:31:50,402","Dead end, Elita.
There's no way..."
580,"00:31:50,437","00:31:51,601","Well, she's gone."
581,"00:32:06,453","00:32:07,881",Whoa!
582,"00:32:07,916","00:32:10,818","Why? Why am I doing this?
Why am I doing this?"
583,"00:32:10,853","00:32:11,962",Climb faster!
584,"00:32:26,935","00:32:28,275",Gotcha!
585,"00:33:01,541","00:33:03,640","Ah, the surface."
586,"00:33:03,675","00:33:06,181",It's beautiful.
587,"00:33:08,053","00:33:12,121",I am speechless.
588,"00:33:13,421","00:33:15,619","Elita, listen to me."
589,"00:33:15,654","00:33:17,885","We know where the
Matrix of Leadership is."
590,"00:33:17,920","00:33:19,920","Oh, sure. And I'm
really a Prime."
591,"00:33:19,955","00:33:23,330","I just prefer loading
crates of toxic waste."
592,"00:33:23,365","00:33:25,827",Whoa. Where did you get this?
593,"00:33:25,862","00:33:27,598","From my friend Steve.
Orion killed him."
594,"00:33:27,633","00:33:30,073","I did not kill Steve.
He was never alive."
595,"00:33:30,108","00:33:31,470",What? Look.
596,"00:33:31,505","00:33:33,670","Sentinel told us he was
going to the surface,"
597,"00:33:33,705","00:33:35,573",and then we found this message.
598,"00:33:35,608","00:33:37,806","We figured that we could
hand deliver it to him"
599,"00:33:37,841","00:33:40,809","or scout the
locations ourselves."
600,"00:33:40,844","00:33:42,118",Whichever comes first.
601,"00:33:43,979","00:33:45,682",This was too important to wait.
602,"00:33:46,487","00:33:48,388",It will change all of our lives.
603,"00:33:49,259","00:33:51,193","No, no, no, no."
604,"00:33:51,228","00:33:54,493","I'm not going to get demoted
again because of you."
605,"00:33:54,528","00:33:56,374","I'm turning this rig around
and I'm notifying the..."
606,"00:33:56,398","00:33:58,299","Hey, guys? Guys?"
607,"00:33:58,334","00:33:59,366",What is that?
608,"00:34:03,306","00:34:04,998",Is it getting bigger?
609,"00:34:06,309","00:34:07,836",Or closer?
610,"00:34:15,879","00:34:17,912","No, no, no, no, no, no!"
611,"00:34:20,818","00:34:22,521","Are you closing? Don't
close. Stop closing."
612,"00:34:22,556","00:34:23,522",It's closed!
613,"00:34:23,557","00:34:24,721","Oh, come on!"
614,"00:34:30,927","00:34:33,763","Oh, now I know why no
one comes to the surface!"
615,"00:34:57,360","00:34:58,524",Elita?
616,"00:34:59,791","00:35:01,857",Elita?
617,"00:35:01,892","00:35:03,331",You okay?
618,"00:35:05,797","00:35:07,599","Please stop punching
me in the face."
619,"00:35:07,634","00:35:08,798",Can you help?
620,"00:35:08,833","00:35:10,635",Iacon... The train...
621,"00:35:10,670","00:35:13,869","Where's the train? Relax,
okay? Here it comes."
622,"00:35:13,904","00:35:15,904",And there it goes.
623,"00:35:15,939","00:35:19,039","Okay, I was wrong about that.
It was going the other way."
624,"00:35:26,686","00:35:31,227","Okay, so I think this is us,"
625,"00:35:31,262","00:35:33,757","and if we follow the path
to... Now you listen to me,"
626,"00:35:33,792","00:35:36,331","Mr. ""Zero Seconds Since
My Last Accident""!"
627,"00:35:36,366","00:35:39,433","I'll go on your little quest
because I don't have a choice."
628,"00:35:39,468","00:35:43,305","But I carry the map, I navigate,
and if this leads to nothing,"
629,"00:35:43,340","00:35:45,901","then I'm dragging you and
those two idiot go-bots"
630,"00:35:45,936","00:35:47,309",back to Iacon City
631,"00:35:47,344","00:35:49,971","and to the first
supervisor depot we see,"
632,"00:35:50,006","00:35:52,941","at which point you will explain
everything that's happened,"
633,"00:35:52,976","00:35:54,745",using words that reflect me
634,"00:35:54,780","00:35:57,011","in a very positive
light! Got it?"
635,"00:35:57,046","00:35:59,288","Yeah, okay. Deal.
Great. All right."
636,"00:35:59,323","00:36:01,620",Let's go! She's joining us?
637,"00:36:01,655","00:36:03,259",Fantastic!
638,"00:36:03,294","00:36:06,658","Hi there. Uh, Elita, right?
Am I saying that right?"
639,"00:36:06,693","00:36:08,924","Wanted to formally
introduce myself."
640,"00:36:08,959","00:36:12,598","I'm B-127. You kneed me in
the face earlier, back there."
641,"00:36:12,633","00:36:15,271","You can call me
B, or Badassatron."
642,"00:36:15,306","00:36:17,031","It's a nickname some
of the guys gave me."
643,"00:36:17,066","00:36:19,440","I don't know. I didn't give
it to myself or anything."
644,"00:36:19,475","00:36:22,542","Actually, it's
pronounced... ""Badassatron,"""
645,"00:36:24,205","00:36:25,644",in case you were wondering.
646,"00:36:26,647","00:36:28,944",Badassatron.
647,"00:36:28,979","00:36:30,946","You like that, right?"
648,"00:36:30,981","00:36:33,146","Badass... I'm gonna
need you to talk less."
649,"00:36:33,181","00:36:34,917","Sure! No... Yeah, no problem."
650,"00:36:34,952","00:36:36,622","What am I talking less
about, my nickname?"
651,"00:36:36,657","00:36:38,921","That's fine with me. Got
some mountains over here..."
652,"00:36:38,956","00:36:40,824","Hey. You're thinking
about what you'll say"
653,"00:36:40,859","00:36:42,793","when you hand the Matrix
to Sentinel, aren't you?"
654,"00:36:42,828","00:36:44,091",I can't help it.
655,"00:36:44,126","00:36:46,368","D, we're really doing this."
656,"00:36:46,403","00:36:49,833","So glad I'm out here with
you. This was a great idea."
657,"00:36:49,868","00:36:51,472",I'm just having a good time.
658,"00:36:51,507","00:36:53,045","How much further is
the Matrix on the map?"
659,"00:36:53,069","00:36:54,541",Make an educated guesstimate.
660,"00:36:54,576","00:36:56,510","This is the coolest thing
that has ever happened"
661,"00:36:56,545","00:36:58,479","to anyone anywhere,
I'm telling you!"
662,"00:36:58,514","00:37:00,877","♪ Not one, not two
Not three, but four ♪"
663,"00:37:00,912","00:37:04,144","♪ Four best friends who are
Walking through the door ♪"
664,"00:37:04,179","00:37:05,552","There's no doors, we're outside."
665,"00:37:05,587","00:37:07,059","Hey, look, there's
more of it over here."
666,"00:37:07,083","00:37:09,655",What is it? It's not metal.
667,"00:37:09,690","00:37:13,120","It's like some kind of
weird nature. It's weird."
668,"00:37:13,155","00:37:14,528",So are they.
669,"00:37:14,563","00:37:16,123",♪ Going to the Matrix ♪
670,"00:37:16,158","00:37:17,663",♪ With my best friends ♪
671,"00:37:17,698","00:37:19,698",What was that?
672,"00:37:30,073","00:37:32,040",Um...
673,"00:37:32,075","00:37:34,581","I think this is not
right. We should go."
674,"00:37:34,616","00:37:36,418","Yeah, good idea. Run!"
675,"00:37:36,453","00:37:38,486",What are we running from?
676,"00:38:03,238","00:38:05,546","- What is that?
- Oh, no."
677,"00:38:05,581","00:38:07,713",It's a Quintesson ship. What?
678,"00:38:07,748","00:38:10,419","What do we do? What
do we do? Shh! Quiet."
679,"00:38:20,992","00:38:23,300","It's scanning for
life-forms. Move, move!"
680,"00:38:29,000","00:38:30,263",Wait!
681,"00:38:33,642","00:38:35,103","Go, go, go, go!"
682,"00:38:43,146","00:38:44,244",Come on!
683,"00:38:44,279","00:38:45,982",They're not gonna make it.
684,"00:38:54,960","00:38:56,256",Whoa.
685,"00:39:13,143","00:39:15,143","What... What were
they searching for?"
686,"00:39:15,178","00:39:16,980","Someone to hug, B.
How should I know?"
687,"00:39:17,015","00:39:19,048","I'm not waiting
around to find out."
688,"00:39:19,754","00:39:21,424",This way. We're close.
689,"00:39:21,459","00:39:24,218","Quintessons haven't
been here for 50 cycles."
690,"00:39:24,253","00:39:26,891","It doesn't make sense.
There's nothing out here."
691,"00:39:49,410","00:39:52,488","A cave with teeth.
Nothing scary about that."
692,"00:39:59,662","00:40:02,157","Knives coming out of
the ceiling. Amazing."
693,"00:40:03,193","00:40:04,665","Everyone, do we
have to go insi...?"
694,"00:40:04,700","00:40:06,733","Okay, yep, we're going in."
695,"00:40:06,768","00:40:09,032","Why shouldn't we? Just walking
into the scariest place"
696,"00:40:09,067","00:40:10,539","I've ever seen in
my entire life."
697,"00:40:12,334","00:40:13,608",This is ridiculous.
698,"00:40:37,260","00:40:38,963",I don't believe it.
699,"00:40:39,735","00:40:41,097",The Primes.
700,"00:40:42,738","00:40:43,869",We're here.
701,"00:41:19,808","00:41:21,841",Megatronus Prime.
702,"00:41:36,253","00:41:37,626",Zeta Prime.

704,"00:41:45,262","00:41:46,536",It's gone.
705,"00:41:49,002","00:41:50,463",Let's keep looking.
706,"00:42:17,668","00:42:18,700","Hey, guys!"
707,"00:42:36,753","00:42:38,588",It's Alpha Trion!
708,"00:42:39,316","00:42:40,689",He's powered down.
709,"00:42:41,516","00:42:44,352",But his spark is still lit.
710,"00:43:02,438","00:43:04,746",Quintesson ambush!

713,"00:43:10,611","00:43:12,787","Whoa, whoa, it's
okay! It's okay."
714,"00:43:13,383","00:43:14,624",You're safe now.
715,"00:43:15,220","00:43:16,351",The war is over.
716,"00:43:37,913","00:43:40,342","I failed you, old friend."
717,"00:43:41,411","00:43:45,347","You deserved so much
better than this end."
718,"00:43:45,382","00:43:47,954","No, you didn't fail."
719,"00:43:47,989","00:43:50,792","We heard your message. We've
come to find the Matrix."
720,"00:43:50,827","00:43:53,993","Your transformation cogs.
What happened to you?"
721,"00:43:54,589","00:43:55,896",Who are you?
722,"00:43:55,931","00:43:58,261","We're cogless
miners, from Iacon."
723,"00:43:58,296","00:44:01,363",Miners? Why?
724,"00:44:01,398","00:44:02,804","Well, we've had to
drill for Energon"
725,"00:44:02,839","00:44:04,938",ever since it stopped flowing.
726,"00:44:04,973","00:44:06,236",Impossible.
727,"00:44:06,271","00:44:08,469","That's why we came.
To fix things."
728,"00:44:08,504","00:44:10,537","If we find the
Matrix of Leadership"
729,"00:44:10,572","00:44:12,275","and get it to Sentinel
Prime, he can fix..."
730,"00:44:12,310","00:44:15,652",Sentinel is no Prime.
731,"00:44:17,018","00:44:19,414",What? He's broken. Fantastic.
732,"00:44:19,449","00:44:21,262","What are you talking about?
Why would you say that?"
733,"00:44:21,286","00:44:23,154",Sentinel Prime is our protector.
734,"00:44:23,189","00:44:25,299","He's been saving us from the
Quintessons ever since..."
735,"00:44:25,323","00:44:29,259","You have not been saved.
You've been living a lie."
736,"00:44:29,294","00:44:32,262","I saw the truth
with my own eyes."
737,"00:44:32,297","00:44:35,397",Come. I will show you.
738,"00:44:41,372","00:44:44,879","For thousands of cycles,
the war with the Quintessons"
739,"00:44:44,914","00:44:47,981",had been a brutal conflict.
740,"00:44:52,218","00:44:56,187","Until Sentinel, the
principal aide to the Primes,"
741,"00:44:56,222","00:44:59,190","intercepted an
enemy transmission."
742,"00:44:59,225","00:45:04,096","There was going to be a secret
gathering of Quintesson commanders."
743,"00:45:04,131","00:45:06,868","Their elimination
could end the war."
744,"00:45:06,903","00:45:13,039","It was a mission so important,
we Primes took it on ourselves."
745,"00:45:13,074","00:45:17,307","We agreed to meet Sentinel for
his sensitive intel in secret,"
746,"00:45:17,342","00:45:19,947",here in this cave.
747,"00:45:19,982","00:45:21,707",But we were not alone.
748,"00:45:24,052","00:45:25,557","- Quintessons!
- They're here!"
749,"00:45:25,581","00:45:27,064",It's a trap! Battle positions!
750,"00:45:27,088","00:45:29,517","Hold the line!
Primus be with us!"
751,"00:45:32,357","00:45:34,621",For Cybertron!
752,"00:45:41,201","00:45:43,333","We were outnumbered,
but stood as one."
753,"00:45:45,601","00:45:47,568",Our victory was near.
754,"00:45:51,178","00:45:53,046",Until we were betrayed.
755,"00:46:17,908","00:46:20,535","Sentinel, why?"
756,"00:46:20,570","00:46:23,076",For all the power of Cybertron.
757,"00:46:26,312","00:46:32,646","But Sentinel never understood the
true power of what he desired."
758,"00:46:32,681","00:46:36,716","The Matrix of Leadership
can only be wielded"
759,"00:46:36,751","00:46:41,688","by one that Primus
himself deems worthy."
760,"00:46:42,790","00:46:47,397","And Sentinel most
certainly was not."
761,"00:46:47,432","00:46:49,465",No!
762,"00:46:52,437","00:46:58,771","Wait. Hold on. You're saying that the
Matrix of Leadership just vanished?"
763,"00:46:58,806","00:47:00,443",No.
764,"00:47:00,478","00:47:02,852","No, no, no. That is
impossible. I don't believe it."
765,"00:47:02,887","00:47:04,711",Why would Sentinel do that?
766,"00:47:04,746","00:47:06,317",To make a bargain.
767,"00:47:06,352","00:47:08,253",A bargain? With who?
768,"00:47:11,027","00:47:14,490","With the new rulers
of Cybertron."
769,"00:47:19,629","00:47:21,464",The Quintessons.
770,"00:47:21,499","00:47:22,696",There are so many.
771,"00:47:44,819","00:47:46,027",He's here.
772,"00:47:46,964","00:47:49,261",Sentinel Prime is here.
773,"00:48:22,362","00:48:25,396","Keep your eyes open.
They always are."
774,"00:49:06,439","00:49:07,977",I load those crates.
775,"00:49:08,012","00:49:10,408","Those are filled with
contaminated metal."
776,"00:49:10,443","00:49:12,113",I don't understand.
777,"00:49:12,148","00:49:14,742","What do the Quintessons
want with toxic waste?"
778,"00:49:19,287","00:49:21,089",Our Energon.
779,"00:49:28,032","00:49:29,295","Traitor! D, no."
780,"00:49:41,936","00:49:44,475",I know what I promised you
781,"00:49:44,510","00:49:47,610","but our mines,
they're running out!"
782,"00:49:47,645","00:49:49,810","There's barely enough
Energon for us."
783,"00:49:52,419","00:49:54,617",I swear I will get you the rest.
784,"00:50:00,328","00:50:02,163",Triple-time every mining shift.
785,"00:50:02,198","00:50:04,858","No miner gets a break
until I get my Energon."
786,"00:50:04,893","00:50:06,530",All of it! Let's go.
787,"00:50:22,779","00:50:26,385",Now you have seen the truth.
788,"00:50:29,852","00:50:31,324",Every day...
789,"00:50:32,360","00:50:37,924",Every single day of my life
790,"00:50:37,959","00:50:40,498",has been a lie.
791,"00:50:41,336","00:50:42,995","My God, I knew it!"
792,"00:50:43,030","00:50:45,866","Deep down, I always
felt something was off."
793,"00:50:45,901","00:50:48,374",He deceived everyone.
794,"00:50:48,409","00:50:53,544","Sentinel bought himself power and then
put us to work paying off his debt."
795,"00:50:53,579","00:50:55,315",I can't believe it.
796,"00:50:55,350","00:50:56,844","Well, obviously,
I can believe it,"
797,"00:50:56,879","00:50:58,681","I just saw it, but I still..."
798,"00:50:58,716","00:51:00,716",I can't believe it.
799,"00:51:00,751","00:51:03,719",Sentinel lied
800,"00:51:03,754","00:51:05,853",to my face. It was all a sham.
801,"00:51:05,888","00:51:08,691","How could we have
been so gullible?"
802,"00:51:08,726","00:51:12,332","Oh, this... this is going
to change everything."
803,"00:51:17,031","00:51:19,339","You just had to
do it, didn't you?"
804,"00:51:19,935","00:51:21,671",Me? What did I do?
805,"00:51:21,706","00:51:23,508","You just had to
go to the surface,"
806,"00:51:23,543","00:51:25,543",had to enter the Iacon 5000.
807,"00:51:25,578","00:51:28,117",You just had to break protocol!
808,"00:51:28,152","00:51:30,383","Who cares about
protocol? I do!"
809,"00:51:30,946","00:51:32,550",I care!
810,"00:51:32,585","00:51:35,190","Because nothing bad happens
when you stay on protocol!"
811,"00:51:35,225","00:51:36,686","Sentinel Prime has
been forcing us"
812,"00:51:36,721","00:51:39,051","to work in the mines
until our gears strip,"
813,"00:51:39,086","00:51:42,758","and all the while he's been giving the
Energon away to our greatest enemies!"
814,"00:51:42,793","00:51:45,772","And what do you think he's going to do
to us when he finds out that we know?"
815,"00:51:45,796","00:51:47,862","I'm not thinking about
what he's going to do,"
816,"00:51:47,897","00:51:49,537","I'm thinking about
what we're going to do."
817,"00:51:49,569","00:51:51,305",That's the whole thing!
818,"00:51:51,340","00:51:53,703","You're never thinking about
anything else, just yourself!"
819,"00:51:53,738","00:51:58,037","Fantastic! Another Orion Pax master
plan. I can't wait to hear this."
820,"00:51:58,072","00:51:59,412",Don't you want to stop him?
821,"00:51:59,447","00:52:01,315","No, I want to kill him!"
822,"00:52:02,582","00:52:04,252",I want to put Sentinel in chains
823,"00:52:04,287","00:52:05,913",and march him through the mines
824,"00:52:05,948","00:52:09,455","so everyone can see him for
the false Prime that he is!"
825,"00:52:09,490","00:52:13,393","I want him to suffer and
then to die in darkness."
826,"00:52:14,660","00:52:16,099","But we all know that
it doesn't matter"
827,"00:52:16,123","00:52:17,727","what I want, right, Pax?"
828,"00:52:17,762","00:52:21,335","The fact is, we're just
cogless bots. Right?"
829,"00:52:22,998","00:52:28,177","We had limited options, and
now... now we have none."
830,"00:52:29,477","00:52:34,447","No son or daughter of Cybertron
is born without a cog."
831,"00:52:34,482","00:52:37,384","Oh, yeah. I've been with
myself since I came online,"
832,"00:52:37,419","00:52:40,354","and this slot's
always been empty."
833,"00:52:40,389","00:52:42,389","What are you saying?
Are you saying..."
834,"00:52:42,424","00:52:45,986","No. No way. Nobody could be
that evil, not even Sentinel."
835,"00:52:46,021","00:52:50,430","He removed your cogs
before you came online."
836,"00:52:50,465","00:52:55,633","We were born with
transformation cogs, but he..."
837,"00:52:55,668","00:52:57,602",He took them from us.
838,"00:52:57,637","00:53:00,836",What defines a Transformer...
839,"00:53:00,871","00:53:03,311",is not the cog in his chest
840,"00:53:03,346","00:53:08,349","but the spark that
resides in their core."
841,"00:53:08,384","00:53:13,684","A spark that gives you the
will to make your world better."
842,"00:53:14,588","00:53:18,183",My fellow Primes had that spark.
843,"00:53:18,218","00:53:22,231",And I see their strength in you.
844,"00:53:23,795","00:53:30,305","Take their cogs and access
your full potential."
845,"00:53:31,000","00:53:32,439",Prima.
846,"00:53:33,904","00:53:34,969",Onyx.
847,"00:53:35,576","00:53:37,103",Alchemist.
848,"00:53:37,875","00:53:39,314",Micronus.
849,"00:53:39,349","00:53:45,144","Warriors of noble spirit,
loyalty, strength."
850,"00:53:45,179","00:53:49,148","Their uniqueness
enhanced by these."
851,"00:54:16,012","00:54:20,421",They were one. You are one.
852,"00:54:20,456","00:54:23,292",All are one!
853,"00:54:36,472","00:54:39,935","Wait. We have...
You... You gave us..."
854,"00:54:39,970","00:54:43,444","The ability to
change your world."
855,"00:54:43,479","00:54:48,614","How you choose to use
that power is up to you."
856,"00:54:53,588","00:54:54,884",They've found us.
857,"00:54:54,919","00:54:57,590","Oh, yes! Time to fight back!"
858,"00:54:57,625","00:55:01,462","No. You must return to Iacon
City and alert everyone."
859,"00:55:04,665","00:55:07,963","Embedded in this are the
records I have shown you."
860,"00:55:07,998","00:55:10,438",Use it to reveal the truth.
861,"00:55:11,606","00:55:12,803",We will.
862,"00:55:12,838","00:55:14,937","This tunnel leads
to the mountains."
863,"00:55:14,972","00:55:17,808","Cybertron's future
is in your hands."
864,"00:55:17,843","00:55:19,304",We're out of time.
865,"00:55:19,339","00:55:20,943",We got to move!
866,"00:55:20,978","00:55:23,715","Wait, we can't just
leave you here."
867,"00:55:23,750","00:55:26,278","Your fight will come, my friend."
868,"00:55:26,313","00:55:29,655",Primus has a purpose for us all.
869,"00:55:29,690","00:55:31,591",But this fight...
870,"00:55:31,626","00:55:33,494",This fight is mine.
871,"00:55:33,529","00:55:35,991",Now go!
872,"00:55:47,004","00:55:48,410","Stand down, old timer."
873,"00:55:48,445","00:55:51,413","Ah. Old, you say?"
874,"00:56:21,236","00:56:23,203",Not too old for you.
875,"00:56:29,046","00:56:30,210",We need to hurry!
876,"00:56:30,245","00:56:31,915","I still think we
have better odds"
877,"00:56:31,950","00:56:33,686",fighting than outrunning them.
878,"00:56:33,721","00:56:36,722","Wait! We have cogs.
We can transform now."
879,"00:56:36,757","00:56:39,692","That's right. Everyone
ready? I was born ready."
880,"00:56:39,727","00:56:41,353",On three. One...
881,"00:56:49,935","00:56:50,935",Ah!
882,"00:56:56,678","00:56:58,172",How do we use these things?
883,"00:56:58,207","00:57:00,108",I don't know. Just try.
884,"00:57:02,046","00:57:04,684",It's working. Ha! It's working!
885,"00:57:05,445","00:57:06,521",My head! My head!
886,"00:57:06,556","00:57:07,588",Whoa!
887,"00:57:07,623","00:57:09,425",Help! Help!
888,"00:57:14,091","00:57:16,630",This is not faster!
889,"00:57:19,800","00:57:21,536","Oh, come on!"
890,"00:57:21,571","00:57:24,638",And transform!
891,"00:57:26,972","00:57:28,675",Wheels! I need wheels!
892,"00:57:38,478","00:57:39,478",Whoa.
893,"00:58:00,104","00:58:02,643",Ha!
894,"00:58:05,615","00:58:07,109","Oh, wow."
895,"00:58:07,144","00:58:08,660","We're alive! I've
never moved that fast."
896,"00:58:08,684","00:58:11,443","That was incredible! Did
you see me slide all over?"
897,"00:58:18,694","00:58:19,891",Yes!
898,"00:58:22,962","00:58:24,489","Hey, whoa, buddy. You okay?"
899,"00:58:24,524","00:58:28,163","I'm great. Are you kidding
me? We can transform!"
900,"00:58:28,198","00:58:30,330",We transform!
901,"00:58:30,365","00:58:31,969","Oh, hey! I know."
902,"00:58:32,004","00:58:34,070","We're wasting time. We
have to get back to Iacon."
903,"00:58:34,105","00:58:35,269",Looks like the fastest way
904,"00:58:35,304","00:58:37,007","back to Iacon is...
Here, I got it."
905,"00:58:37,042","00:58:38,503","Hey, what are you doing?"
906,"00:58:38,538","00:58:40,219","Don't worry, I got it.
Yeah, but be careful."
907,"00:58:40,243","00:58:43,046","Our proof is inside and
you're spilling it everywhere."
908,"00:58:44,346","00:58:49,723",I... got... it.
909,"00:58:51,727","00:58:52,990",Okay.
910,"00:58:56,897","00:58:58,259",Follow me.
911,"00:59:05,235","00:59:07,367",Alpha Trion!
912,"00:59:07,402","00:59:10,205","You are still alive.
Would you look at that?"
913,"00:59:11,076","00:59:13,010",You look horrible.
914,"00:59:13,782","00:59:18,147",Traitor. You are a disgrace.
915,"00:59:18,182","00:59:21,414","Primus will surely...
Uh-huh. Yes. Shut up."
916,"00:59:21,449","00:59:25,220","I seized an opportunity to
take control of my future."
917,"00:59:25,255","00:59:26,705","Anything to get out
of working for you"
918,"00:59:26,729","00:59:29,059","and that boring
council of elders."
919,"00:59:29,094","00:59:31,259","Seriously, I would
watch you Primes"
920,"00:59:31,294","00:59:33,393",spend half the day losing a war
921,"00:59:33,428","00:59:38,233","and the other half sitting around
waxing poetic about loyalty and honor."
922,"00:59:38,268","00:59:39,531",And now look at you.
923,"00:59:39,566","00:59:43,370",You will fall.
924,"00:59:43,405","00:59:45,438",And a new Prime will rise...
925,"00:59:45,473","00:59:46,978",There you go again.
926,"00:59:47,013","00:59:49,915","I don't want to listen
to any more speeches."
927,"00:59:51,281","00:59:52,731","There were others in
the cave with you."
928,"00:59:52,755","00:59:53,787",Who are they?
929,"00:59:53,822","00:59:56,922",They are to be your undoing.
930,"00:59:56,957","01:00:01,355","You've lost, Sentinel.
Nothing you can do..."
931,"01:00:07,330","01:00:10,463","Oh, didn't I just
say no speeches?"
932,"01:00:10,498","01:00:12,102","You heard me, right?"
933,"01:00:12,137","01:00:14,533","This is what I'm talking
about. Unbelievable."
934,"01:00:14,568","01:00:17,437","All of them are like
that. So disrespectful."
935,"01:00:19,078","01:00:21,276",Okay. Hunt down the others.
936,"01:00:21,311","01:00:22,618",With pleasure.
937,"01:00:39,263","01:00:40,460","Hey, buddy."
938,"01:00:41,133","01:00:42,495",Oh. Hey.
939,"01:00:44,169","01:00:47,302","You've been a little
quiet. Are you all right?"
940,"01:00:47,337","01:00:51,636","All I can think about is
Sentinel's smirking face."
941,"01:00:51,671","01:00:55,475","He must pay for what he's done.
Someone has to do something."
942,"01:00:55,510","01:00:59,688","We are. With Alpha's proof inside that
device, we will show everyone the truth."
943,"01:00:59,723","01:01:02,790","You honestly believe
it'll be that easy?"
944,"01:01:02,825","01:01:04,792","Iacon doesn't want
to hear the truth."
945,"01:01:04,827","01:01:07,058",They worship Sentinel.
946,"01:01:07,093","01:01:09,093","There's got to be a better
way to bring him down."
947,"01:01:09,128","01:01:11,799","We have to trust everyone will
believe what we show them."
948,"01:01:11,834","01:01:13,900",I trusted Sentinel!
949,"01:01:14,496","01:01:15,594",With everything.
950,"01:01:16,773","01:01:22,073","I will never trust a
so-called leader ever again."
951,"01:01:24,671","01:01:26,407","There's only one bot
I know I can trust..."
952,"01:01:37,057","01:01:39,255","All right, wake them up."
953,"01:02:02,181","01:02:05,446","Now, are you spies"
954,"01:02:06,581","01:02:09,758",or just incompetent lackeys?
955,"01:02:09,793","01:02:12,585","We're not spies. But
he is incompetent."
956,"01:02:12,620","01:02:16,930","Scanning electrical impulses.
He speaks the truth."
957,"01:02:16,965","01:02:21,495","That just means he believes
himself, like any spy would."
958,"01:02:23,532","01:02:26,038","Uh, why is he gagged?"
959,"01:02:26,073","01:02:27,732",He wouldn't stop talking.
960,"01:02:27,767","01:02:29,283",Even when he was unconscious?
961,"01:02:29,307","01:02:31,505","Especially when he
was unconscious!"
962,"01:02:31,540","01:02:32,748",Enough!
963,"01:02:33,410","01:02:35,344",Two options for you!
964,"01:02:35,379","01:02:40,052","One, we slowly dismantle each of
you one bolt and screw at a time,"
965,"01:02:40,087","01:02:42,714","and really make
sure you feel it."
966,"01:02:43,893","01:02:45,651","In exchange for a quick death,"
967,"01:02:45,686","01:02:48,093","you give us intel on
the Energon trains,"
968,"01:02:48,128","01:02:50,095",access to the mines
969,"01:02:50,130","01:02:53,802","or anything else that could
hurt your boss, Sentinel Prime."
970,"01:02:53,837","01:02:55,331",Who exactly are you guys?
971,"01:02:57,071","01:02:58,103",Ah!
972,"01:02:58,138","01:03:01,172",The Cybertronian High Guard!
973,"01:03:01,207","01:03:03,075","I told you it
wasn't tight enough!"
974,"01:03:03,110","01:03:06,210","Prestigious defenders
of Iacon. Prestigious?"
975,"01:03:06,245","01:03:08,949","He's right. I read all
about you in the archives."
976,"01:03:08,984","01:03:12,381","You were the most legendary
warriors in all of Cybertron."
977,"01:03:12,416","01:03:14,185","Look, look, look!
That's Starscream,"
978,"01:03:14,220","01:03:17,089","and you're Shockwave,
and Soundwave."
979,"01:03:17,124","01:03:19,729","Raise your hand if ""wave"" is in
your name. There's a lot of ""waves."""
980,"01:03:19,753","01:03:21,291",Silence!
981,"01:03:21,326","01:03:23,425","The yellow annoying
one is correct."
982,"01:03:23,460","01:03:24,426",Whoo!
983,"01:03:24,461","01:03:26,263",We were once the High Guard.
984,"01:03:26,298","01:03:30,003","We witnessed Sentinel's
betrayal, saw the Primes fall."
985,"01:03:30,038","01:03:32,907","Since that day, we've been
fighting from the shadows,"
986,"01:03:32,942","01:03:35,635","doing whatever we can
to sabotage Sentinel."
987,"01:03:35,670","01:03:37,373","That's great! We're...
Whoa, whoa, whoa."
988,"01:03:37,408","01:03:41,080","Okay, okay. We're
good. Everyone relax."
989,"01:03:41,115","01:03:43,577",I'm just saying we're allies.
990,"01:03:43,612","01:03:45,645","We were on our
way back to Iacon,"
991,"01:03:45,680","01:03:49,715","and now with your help, we can unify
Cybertron against Sentinel Prime."
992,"01:03:49,750","01:03:53,862","The idea of a unified
Cybertron is a myth."
993,"01:03:53,897","01:03:58,724","All that counts is the strength
of one bot over another!"
994,"01:04:00,728","01:04:03,597","Okay. So, these guys
are a little intense."
995,"01:04:03,632","01:04:05,533",Yeah. Just a little.
996,"01:04:05,568","01:04:06,908",Hey!
997,"01:04:06,943","01:04:08,470",What are you doing?
998,"01:04:11,640","01:04:13,706",I tell you what I'm not doing.
999,"01:04:13,741","01:04:17,644","I'm not cowering in some busted
ship, playing king of the throne."
1000,"01:04:17,679","01:04:19,844","I'm not pretending like
I'm making a difference"
1001,"01:04:19,879","01:04:22,583","by throwing one punch and
then running away to hide!"
1002,"01:04:22,618","01:04:24,849","I found out that
Sentinel is rotten today,"
1003,"01:04:24,884","01:04:26,851","and I'm gonna make
him pay for it."
1004,"01:04:26,886","01:04:28,358",Today!
1005,"01:04:28,393","01:04:31,966","You think you can insult
me and just walk away?"
1006,"01:04:32,001","01:04:36,003","No one leaves here
unless I say so."
1007,"01:04:36,038","01:04:37,664",Is that right?
1008,"01:04:38,667","01:04:40,832","Well, how can you say so"
1009,"01:04:40,867","01:04:42,801",with my head in your teeth?
1010,"01:04:42,836","01:04:44,473",D!
1011,"01:04:51,383","01:04:52,415",Whoa!
1012,"01:04:57,554","01:04:58,883",Hit me!
1013,"01:04:58,918","01:05:02,161","Do it! Come on! Yeah, more!"
1014,"01:05:02,196","01:05:05,692",D-16! D-16! D-16!
1015,"01:05:07,894","01:05:12,864","You want to see the strength
of one bot over another? Huh?"
1016,"01:05:12,899","01:05:14,943","Is that all you've
got, tough bot?"
1017,"01:05:14,978","01:05:17,737",Let's go! Do it! Come on!
1018,"01:05:35,394","01:05:37,460",Please! I beg you!
1019,"01:05:37,495","01:05:40,298","Stop! D, he's not the enemy!"
1020,"01:05:42,632","01:05:44,764",Bear witness!
1021,"01:05:44,799","01:05:47,569","This is the last
time I show mercy!"
1022,"01:05:47,604","01:05:50,242",Decide right now:
1023,"01:05:50,277","01:05:54,873","You can stay here in hiding,
bowing before your pathetic leader,"
1024,"01:05:54,908","01:05:58,217","or follow me as
we march on Iacon"
1025,"01:05:58,252","01:06:01,781","and I take down Sentinel
once and for all!"
1026,"01:06:04,291","01:06:08,854",D-16! D-16! D-16!
1027,"01:06:35,718","01:06:36,948","B, come on!"
1028,"01:07:01,975","01:07:04,745","Engage all hostiles!
I've got the bridge!"
1029,"01:07:36,515","01:07:37,515","Elita, get down!"
1030,"01:08:00,033","01:08:02,671","I feel like someone
dropped a cliff on me."
1031,"01:08:02,706","01:08:05,212",Where are the others?
1032,"01:08:05,247","01:08:09,007","Sentinel's troops took as many
prisoners as they could carry."
1033,"01:08:09,042","01:08:10,811",They got D-16 and B.
1034,"01:08:10,846","01:08:12,681","Oh, no."
1035,"01:08:12,716","01:08:15,255","And half of those
High-Guard nutjobs."
1036,"01:08:17,292","01:08:18,984",Our proof.
1037,"01:08:19,019","01:08:20,425",It's gone.
1038,"01:08:21,296","01:08:23,560","So, what do we do now?"
1039,"01:08:23,595","01:08:25,166",D was right.
1040,"01:08:25,201","01:08:27,762",About what? Everything.
1041,"01:08:27,797","01:08:31,403","Look at it. Look around.
This is a disaster."
1042,"01:08:31,966","01:08:33,141",It's all my fault.
1043,"01:08:33,176","01:08:35,066","I should have
stayed on protocol."
1044,"01:08:41,349","01:08:44,746","Listen to me. I really
want you to hear this."
1045,"01:08:44,781","01:08:45,813",Are you listening?
1046,"01:08:48,422","01:08:49,817",I'm better than you.
1047,"01:08:50,820","01:08:52,457","Yeah, okay, I'm hearing you."
1048,"01:08:53,328","01:08:55,086","I'm better than
you in every way,"
1049,"01:08:55,121","01:08:57,594",except you have hope.
1050,"01:08:57,629","01:09:01,301","You always have. You went back
into the mine to rescue Jazz."
1051,"01:09:01,336","01:09:05,272","You snuck up to the surface to
find the Matrix of Leadership."
1052,"01:09:05,307","01:09:07,098","Yeah, and how'd that work out?"
1053,"01:09:07,133","01:09:08,869","My point is,"
1054,"01:09:08,904","01:09:13,137","that your instincts tell you
to break protocol for a reason."
1055,"01:09:13,172","01:09:16,250","This blind optimism
that you have"
1056,"01:09:16,285","01:09:20,617","is why you make such bold
and courageous choices,"
1057,"01:09:21,686","01:09:23,488",that are also extremely stupid.
1058,"01:09:23,523","01:09:26,051",First time giving a pep talk?
1059,"01:09:26,086","01:09:27,822",You're inspiring.
1060,"01:09:27,857","01:09:31,199","You can envision a better
future that no one else can see."
1061,"01:09:32,268","01:09:35,302","And if we ever want to
see B and D-16 again,"
1062,"01:09:35,337","01:09:39,339","that is the Orion Pax
that we need right now."
1063,"01:09:40,540","01:09:41,572",Listen to me.
1064,"01:09:42,476","01:09:43,673",We can do this.
1065,"01:09:45,710","01:09:49,349","Those Energon trains will
be heading back to Iacon."
1066,"01:09:49,384","01:09:52,077",If we intercepted one...
1067,"01:09:52,112","01:09:55,289","Hell yes, I can reroute
it. What else do we need?"
1068,"01:09:55,324","01:10:00,019","Well, my bold instincts tell me
we have to recruit some nutjobs."
1069,"01:10:02,056","01:10:04,364",I was afraid you'd say that.
1070,"01:10:04,399","01:10:07,961","Uh, Shockwave, Soundwave.
You in the back."
1071,"01:10:07,996","01:10:11,239","In order to save our captured
friends, we have to act now."
1072,"01:10:11,274","01:10:13,538","How about I blast
you back to Iacon?"
1073,"01:10:13,573","01:10:16,970",Oh! She punched me in my eye!
1074,"01:10:17,005","01:10:20,215","Everyone, shut up! All
of you. Listen to him."
1075,"01:10:21,680","01:10:24,043","Most likely, our friends
are being held captive"
1076,"01:10:24,078","01:10:25,715",at the top of Sentinel's tower.
1077,"01:10:25,750","01:10:28,751","A surprise attack would give
us a chance to rescue them."
1078,"01:10:28,786","01:10:33,723","Impossible. We do not have
enough soldiers or a way inside."
1079,"01:10:33,758","01:10:36,891","Elita will get us in. And
I will get more troops."
1080,"01:10:36,926","01:10:38,530",Why should we follow you?
1081,"01:10:39,698","01:10:41,368",We will follow you.
1082,"01:10:41,403","01:10:44,602","Attention, High Guard.
Prepare for battle."
1083,"01:10:44,637","01:10:46,637",What is our first move?
1084,"01:10:46,672","01:10:47,803",We roll out.
1085,"01:10:49,378","01:10:50,410",What?
1086,"01:10:50,445","01:10:51,840",Louder.
1087,"01:10:51,875","01:10:54,282",Transform and roll out!
1088,"01:11:04,184","01:11:07,823","I don't understand.
Why are we still alive?"
1089,"01:11:07,858","01:11:11,431","Look at this rowdy
bunch! The High Guard!"
1090,"01:11:11,466","01:11:13,301","You know, you guys have
been tough to find."
1091,"01:11:13,336","01:11:16,898","Every trip to the surface,
I've been searching for you."
1092,"01:11:16,933","01:11:19,439","Tracking the bots in the
cave led me right to them."
1093,"01:11:19,474","01:11:20,770",Oh-ho-ho!
1094,"01:11:20,805","01:11:23,707","You captured Starscream!
It was too easy."
1095,"01:11:23,742","01:11:25,907","I'm going to rip you
apart piece by piece"
1096,"01:11:25,942","01:11:27,422",so that your death is painful!
1097,"01:11:27,449","01:11:28,723","You'll regret the
day you were..."
1098,"01:11:28,747","01:11:30,681","You sound ridiculous.
It's weird."
1099,"01:11:30,716","01:11:33,717","Oh, D-16, what a
tragic story you'll be."
1100,"01:11:33,752","01:11:37,622","Atop the leaderboard in your
sector and secretly a traitor."
1101,"01:11:37,657","01:11:39,723","I'm not a traitor.
You're the traitor."
1102,"01:11:39,758","01:11:42,462","Nuh-uh. You, all of
you, are traitors."
1103,"01:11:42,497","01:11:46,158","You've been working with the
Quintessons to sabotage my expeditions."
1104,"01:11:46,193","01:11:48,611","You're the reason why I haven't
found the Matrix of Leadership yet."
1105,"01:11:48,635","01:11:49,898",None of that is true!
1106,"01:11:49,933","01:11:51,504","Oh, trust me, it'll be very true"
1107,"01:11:51,539","01:11:54,441","when I'm executing you
in front of all of Iacon."
1108,"01:11:54,476","01:11:58,269","Because down here, the
truth is what I make it."
1109,"01:12:07,016","01:12:09,423","Well, well. What's this about?"
1110,"01:12:10,283","01:12:12,987","I'm not kneeling
in front of you."
1111,"01:12:13,022","01:12:14,956","Feeling confident, are we?"
1112,"01:12:14,991","01:12:18,190","You don't scare me.
You want to know why?"
1113,"01:12:18,225","01:12:19,290",Please.
1114,"01:12:20,502","01:12:23,536","Because I don't have
anything left to lose."
1115,"01:12:23,571","01:12:25,703",You took it all.
1116,"01:12:27,069","01:12:28,442",I sure did.
1117,"01:12:31,546","01:12:33,909","Ah, Megatronus Prime."
1118,"01:12:35,308","01:12:38,386","Of course you were a fan.
Megatronus was the coolest Prime!"
1119,"01:12:38,421","01:12:41,279","The biggest! The
baddest! The toughest!"
1120,"01:12:42,524","01:12:44,755","That's why, after I killed him,"
1121,"01:12:45,791","01:12:48,022",I took his cog for myself.
1122,"01:12:48,057","01:12:50,530","He was greater than
you'll ever be!"
1123,"01:12:50,565","01:12:52,829",I don't know. I'm pretty great.
1124,"01:12:52,864","01:12:55,700","But I can understand why you'd
want to wear his face over mine."
1125,"01:12:55,735","01:12:56,767",Here.
1126,"01:12:58,001","01:13:01,233","Let's make sure it
doesn't come off."
1127,"01:13:19,990","01:13:22,529",Okay.
1128,"01:13:22,564","01:13:25,092",I can do this.
1129,"01:13:38,745","01:13:42,241","You can't be serious. We just
worked 22 shifts without a break!"
1130,"01:13:42,276","01:13:43,990","These miners need rest
and time to repair and..."
1131,"01:13:44,014","01:13:46,278","Sentinel Prime
wants more Energon."
1132,"01:13:46,313","01:13:49,721","So get back in the mines before
I make you get back in the..."
1133,"01:13:55,421","01:13:57,388","Who was that? Did
you see who that was?"
1134,"01:13:57,423","01:13:58,598",That can't be him.
1135,"01:13:58,633","01:13:59,698",Is that...
1136,"01:14:00,800","01:14:02,393",It can't be.
1137,"01:14:02,428","01:14:04,934",Orion? Jazz.
1138,"01:14:04,969","01:14:06,364",Is it really you?
1139,"01:14:06,399","01:14:08,773","Yeah, I know I, uh,
look a little different."
1140,"01:14:08,808","01:14:10,368","""Little""?"
1141,"01:14:10,403","01:14:12,205","There's nothing
""little"" about you."
1142,"01:14:12,240","01:14:14,075","Uh, how is this possible?"
1143,"01:14:14,110","01:14:16,913","Sentinel told us you died
from your race injuries."
1144,"01:14:17,751","01:14:19,883",Sentinel is a liar.
1145,"01:14:19,918","01:14:21,918",What? Huh?
1146,"01:14:21,953","01:14:24,085","Look, I know how this
will sound coming from me."
1147,"01:14:24,120","01:14:27,594","I was never the
most focused miner."
1148,"01:14:27,629","01:14:30,058","But as you can see,
everything is different now."
1149,"01:14:37,903","01:14:42,136","I went to the surface
and I learned the truth."
1150,"01:14:43,612","01:14:45,271","My friends,"
1151,"01:14:45,306","01:14:49,374","we were all born with
transformation cogs."
1152,"01:14:50,410","01:14:53,587","And then Sentinel, he
stole them from us."
1153,"01:14:53,622","01:14:56,986","He took away our ability
to make our own decisions."
1154,"01:14:57,021","01:14:59,153",He stole our freedom.
1155,"01:15:02,961","01:15:08,800","But now, I'm offering you
your first real choice."
1156,"01:15:08,835","01:15:12,936","You can work a 23rd shift
and mine yourself to death"
1157,"01:15:14,643","01:15:17,468","or fight back against
Sentinel with me."
1158,"01:15:18,009","01:15:20,141",Right now.
1159,"01:15:20,176","01:15:23,518","How are we supposed to do that? We
can't fight. We don't have cogs."
1160,"01:15:25,852","01:15:29,788","What defines a Transformer
is not the cog in its chest"
1161,"01:15:29,823","01:15:32,758","but the spark that
resides in their core."
1162,"01:15:32,793","01:15:36,927","A spark that gives you the
will to make your world better."
1163,"01:15:36,962","01:15:40,799","And that spark, Sentinel
can never take from us."
1164,"01:15:40,834","01:15:43,197","There's not enough of
us. We'd need an army."
1165,"01:15:43,232","01:15:46,970","And we have one. Elita
is bringing troops."
1166,"01:15:47,005","01:15:49,038",We are not alone in this.
1167,"01:15:49,073","01:15:51,843","If we want to be in
control of our own destiny,"
1168,"01:15:51,878","01:15:53,504",we will have to fight for it.
1169,"01:15:53,539","01:15:56,881","Now is the time for
us to stand up..."
1170,"01:15:56,916","01:15:58,883",for ourselves.
1171,"01:16:01,217","01:16:03,151",Stand up for this injustice.
1172,"01:16:05,386","01:16:09,058","I promise you this
fight will be worth it."
1173,"01:16:09,995","01:16:11,731",Follow me.
1174,"01:16:11,766","01:16:14,635","Nothing can stop us
when we stand together."
1175,"01:16:14,670","01:16:18,166",Together as one.
1176,"01:16:18,201","01:16:22,676","Orion Pax! Orion
Pax! Orion Pax!"
1177,"01:16:22,711","01:16:25,173","Elita, it's time."
1178,"01:16:25,208","01:16:26,504",You got it.
1179,"01:16:26,539","01:16:28,781","Buckle up, Blinky.
We're going in."
1180,"01:16:42,192","01:16:43,422",Not a good idea.
1181,"01:16:45,591","01:16:47,767","D, stay down."
1182,"01:16:59,572","01:17:01,407","Well, that's a shame."
1183,"01:17:01,442","01:17:03,376",You really were a great miner.
1184,"01:17:07,888","01:17:10,317","We've got a breach!
Protect Sentinel!"
1185,"01:17:19,559","01:17:22,131","They spotted us. It's
about to get bumpy."
1186,"01:17:23,068","01:17:24,771","High Guard, eject."
1187,"01:17:24,806","01:17:26,740",Come on! Move out!
1188,"01:17:41,614","01:17:43,757","There's too many.
We have to abort!"
1189,"01:17:49,391","01:17:50,456",We're not gonna make it.
1190,"01:17:53,329","01:17:54,295",Whoo-hoo!
1191,"01:17:54,330","01:17:55,901","Metal to the pedal, miners!"
1192,"01:17:55,936","01:17:57,661",Let's break some protocol!
1193,"01:17:57,696","01:17:59,432","That's what I'm
talking about, Pax!"
1194,"01:18:09,015","01:18:11,345",Whoa! That's intense.
1195,"01:18:11,380","01:18:16,053","You can't win, miner.
I see everything!"
1196,"01:18:17,320","01:18:18,957","That's right, you do."
1197,"01:18:18,992","01:18:21,696","Except the tower we're
about to crash into."
1198,"01:18:34,667","01:18:36,337",What's going on?
1199,"01:18:40,541","01:18:41,716",Hey!
1200,"01:18:47,185","01:18:48,987",What has he done to you?
1201,"01:18:49,022","01:18:51,858","This is nothing compared to
what I'm gonna do to Sentinel."
1202,"01:18:52,795","01:18:55,059","Soundwave, free the prisoners."
1203,"01:18:59,725","01:19:02,066","I know how to stop him.
Airachnid is the answer."
1204,"01:19:02,101","01:19:03,837",I'm doing this my way. D!
1205,"01:19:09,372","01:19:10,404",Yes!
1206,"01:19:10,439","01:19:11,471",Whoa!
1207,"01:19:11,506","01:19:13,011",Whoa-ho-ho!
1208,"01:19:13,046","01:19:14,375",I got a battle mask!
1209,"01:19:16,148","01:19:18,049",Elita! Battle mask!
1210,"01:19:18,084","01:19:21,019","It appeared when
this guy tried to..."
1211,"01:19:21,054","01:19:23,054","Knife hands? I
have knife hands!"
1212,"01:19:26,059","01:19:27,124",What the...?
1213,"01:19:30,162","01:19:31,931",Badassatron.
1214,"01:19:37,235","01:19:39,136",Where's Sentinel?
1215,"01:19:41,844","01:19:43,943",You pathetic little twits.
1216,"01:19:43,978","01:19:48,277","Did you really think that you could
knock down everything I've built?"
1217,"01:19:48,312","01:19:52,116","It's over, Sentinel. You can't
escape the truth. What truth?"
1218,"01:19:52,151","01:19:54,822","That I plucked the cogs
from your newborn chests?"
1219,"01:19:54,857","01:19:57,033","Forced you to mine so that I
could pay off the Quintessons"
1220,"01:19:57,057","01:19:58,386",and live like a king?
1221,"01:19:58,421","01:20:01,389","None of that matters!
Because the truth..."
1222,"01:20:01,424","01:20:05,393",is what I make it.
1223,"01:20:07,595","01:20:08,595",Incoming!
1224,"01:20:10,400","01:20:11,663",Whoa!
1225,"01:20:15,438","01:20:17,075","He's too strong.
I have a plan."
1226,"01:20:17,110","01:20:19,275",We need Airachnid. Airachnid?
1227,"01:20:19,310","01:20:21,541","We need her memory.
Where is she?"
1228,"01:20:21,576","01:20:23,147",Found her!
1229,"01:20:24,678","01:20:25,678",Elita!
1230,"01:20:26,515","01:20:27,921",Do not break her.
1231,"01:20:27,956","01:20:29,263","Bring her to the
broadcast station."
1232,"01:20:29,287","01:20:30,484",We'll meet you there.
1233,"01:20:30,519","01:20:32,453",Easier said than done.
1234,"01:20:51,507","01:20:52,781","I said, don't break her!"
1235,"01:20:52,805","01:20:55,806",Relax! I'm being very gentle.
1236,"01:21:00,120","01:21:02,989","Orion! Orion, look!
I have knife hands!"
1237,"01:21:03,024","01:21:04,584",I can see that.
1238,"01:21:04,619","01:21:06,784","I'm gonna cut these
guys. Watch. Come here!"
1239,"01:21:06,819","01:21:08,654","You can jab them
later. We got to go."
1240,"01:21:12,000","01:21:13,032",Yeah!
1241,"01:21:32,350","01:21:34,548","Uh, excuse me. You
can't be in here."
1242,"01:21:41,821","01:21:43,491",B!
1243,"01:21:43,526","01:21:46,329","These are not the bad guys.
Why did you cut the door?"
1244,"01:21:46,364","01:21:48,969","What? No, I didn't...
That was an... I..."
1245,"01:21:49,004","01:21:50,597","It was already
like that. Right?"
1246,"01:21:50,632","01:21:51,950","Yes, that's right.
That's right, yes."
1247,"01:21:51,974","01:21:54,040","Yeah, it was already
like... Yes. Mm-hmm."
1248,"01:21:58,706","01:22:00,574","Attention, Iacon City."
1249,"01:22:00,609","01:22:03,951","Stand by for a live transmission
from Sentinel Prime."
1250,"01:22:09,750","01:22:11,321","What's wrong, D-16?"
1251,"01:22:12,258","01:22:13,422",Rise up!
1252,"01:22:17,131","01:22:19,076",That's why after I killed him...
1253,"01:22:19,100","01:22:23,201","That's why after I killed him,
I took his cog for myself."
1254,"01:22:23,236","01:22:25,533",Cog for myself.
1255,"01:22:25,568","01:22:29,372","What truth? That I plucked the
cogs from your newborn chests?"
1256,"01:22:29,407","01:22:31,088","Forced you to mine so
that I could pay off"
1257,"01:22:31,112","01:22:32,936","the Quintessons and
live like a king?"
1258,"01:22:32,971","01:22:34,641",What truth?
1259,"01:22:34,676","01:22:36,588","That I plucked the cogs
from your newborn chests?"
1260,"01:22:36,612","01:22:38,293","Forced you to mine so
that I could pay off"
1261,"01:22:38,317","01:22:40,449","the Quintessons and
live like a king?"
1262,"01:22:40,484","01:22:42,286","I'm working my miners
as hard as I can."
1263,"01:22:42,321","01:22:45,256",I swear I will get you the rest!
1264,"01:22:45,291","01:22:47,423","I'm working my miners
as hard as I can."
1265,"01:22:47,458","01:22:50,228",I swear I will get you the rest!
1266,"01:22:50,263","01:22:52,593","I'm working my miners as
hard as I can, I swear..."
1267,"01:22:52,628","01:22:54,232",Liar!
1268,"01:22:56,995","01:22:58,896",We trusted you!
1269,"01:22:59,569","01:23:00,601",Traitor!
1270,"01:23:00,636","01:23:02,669","Pax, we did it."
1271,"01:23:14,287","01:23:15,451",D!
1272,"01:23:43,349","01:23:44,381",D-16.
1273,"01:23:45,219","01:23:47,681",We can lead Cybertron together!
1274,"01:23:47,716","01:23:49,089",Don't do this!
1275,"01:23:55,361","01:23:56,492",What are you doing?
1276,"01:23:56,527","01:23:58,131","It's over, D."
1277,"01:23:58,166","01:24:00,298","Everyone in Iacon
knows the truth."
1278,"01:24:00,333","01:24:01,959",So do I!
1279,"01:24:01,994","01:24:05,138","He took everything from
us! I have to do this!"
1280,"01:24:05,173","01:24:06,799","No, you don't."
1281,"01:24:06,834","01:24:10,506","Rebuilding Iacon cannot
begin with an execution."
1282,"01:24:10,541","01:24:13,036","He deserves to die!
Can't you see that?"
1283,"01:24:13,071","01:24:16,050","We're better than this.
Don't be like Sentinel."
1284,"01:24:18,010","01:24:19,713","Pax,"
1285,"01:24:19,748","01:24:23,783","you need to move out of my
way before I move you myself."
1286,"01:24:23,818","01:24:25,983","D, listen..."
1287,"01:24:34,092","01:24:35,366",Stop!
1288,"01:24:47,248","01:24:48,346",No!
1289,"01:24:48,381","01:24:50,414","No, no, no, no. Why?"
1290,"01:24:51,483","01:24:53,846",Why did you do that? Why?
1291,"01:25:03,297","01:25:05,957","D, no."
1292,"01:25:12,031","01:25:13,503",I'm done saving you.
1293,"01:26:53,407","01:26:56,441",The Age of Primes has ended!
1294,"01:26:56,476","01:26:58,806",No more false prophets!

never again be deceived."
1296,"01:27:03,879","01:27:06,418",Rise up!
1297,"01:27:06,453","01:27:08,486",Rise up! Rise up!
1298,"01:27:08,521","01:27:11,687",Rise up! Rise up! Rise up!

1300,"01:27:14,087","01:27:17,187","your noble sacrifice
for the greater good"
1301,"01:27:17,222","01:27:21,235","has proven you worthy
in the eyes of Primus."

1304,"01:27:27,441","01:27:33,038",and the Matrix of Leadership!
1305,"01:27:34,272","01:27:37,647","I will lead us all
into the future!"
1306,"01:27:54,666","01:27:55,731",I...
1307,"01:27:56,503","01:27:57,568",am...
1308,"01:27:58,439","01:28:00,274",Megatron!
1309,"01:28:00,969","01:28:02,903",Arise...
1310,"01:28:03,609","01:28:06,038",Optimus Prime.
1311,"01:28:09,010","01:28:10,911",Burn it down!
1312,"01:28:11,584","01:28:12,913",All of it!
1313,"01:28:18,316","01:28:21,493",All hail Megatron!
1314,"01:28:23,398","01:28:25,893","He's gonna kill everyone. We
have to stop him. Come on."
1315,"01:28:27,402","01:28:29,094",Stop! It's over.
1316,"01:28:29,129","01:28:32,867","It's over when every last
one of his followers is dead!"
1317,"01:29:06,331","01:29:07,803",Impossible.
1318,"01:29:10,478","01:29:14,337",Primus gave you the Matrix.
1319,"01:29:14,372","01:29:16,548","We could've built
the future together."
1320,"01:29:16,583","01:29:18,583",I'll build it myself.
1321,"01:29:18,618","01:29:22,180","After I tear down
everyone in my way!"
1322,"01:30:03,762","01:30:04,794",Ah!
1323,"01:31:06,924","01:31:10,123","We were given the power
to change our world"
1324,"01:31:10,158","01:31:12,631",and you chose to destroy it.
1325,"01:31:12,666","01:31:14,094",Just like Sentinel.
1326,"01:31:14,129","01:31:17,966","You have betrayed
Cybertron and its citizens."
1327,"01:31:19,640","01:31:22,432",And you betrayed me.
1328,"01:31:33,511","01:31:34,587",Go.
1329,"01:31:35,447","01:31:38,118",Take the High Guard and leave.
1330,"01:31:39,352","01:31:42,958",You are banished from Iacon.
1331,"01:31:47,833","01:31:50,163",It didn't have to end this way.
1332,"01:31:52,497","01:31:55,971","This isn't over, Prime."
1333,"01:32:03,310","01:32:05,882","High Guard, follow me!"
1334,"01:32:19,491","01:32:22,030","The line between
friend and enemy"
1335,"01:32:22,065","01:32:25,198","is not as clear as
I once believed."
1336,"01:32:25,233","01:32:29,136","Once it's crossed,
there's no going back."
1337,"01:32:29,171","01:32:33,173","Because some transformations
are permanent."
1338,"01:32:33,208","01:32:35,043","Hey, Megatronus Prime. Nice."
1339,"01:32:35,078","01:32:37,210","Oh, yeah. Well, he's my hero."
1340,"01:32:37,245","01:32:39,047",The greatest Prime to ever live.
1341,"01:32:40,820","01:32:43,546",I'm D-16. Orion Pax.
1342,"01:32:43,581","01:32:45,955",You ever mine Energon before?
1343,"01:32:45,990","01:32:47,352",No. You?
1344,"01:32:47,387","01:32:49,563",No. I hear it's dangerous.
1345,"01:32:50,258","01:32:51,664","Well, I'll tell you what."
1346,"01:32:51,699","01:32:54,194","You watch my back, I
promise to watch yours."
1347,"01:32:54,229","01:32:55,393",All right.
1348,"01:32:56,000","01:32:58,231","Thanks, Pax."
1349,"01:33:11,279","01:33:13,576",A new beginning for Cybertron.
1350,"01:33:13,611","01:33:15,688",And a new leader.
1351,"01:33:15,723","01:33:17,690","Yes, about that."
1352,"01:33:17,725","01:33:22,695","I could use some help from a bot
who is better than me in every way."
1353,"01:33:22,730","01:33:24,664","Who, me? Oh, no, no."
1354,"01:33:24,699","01:33:27,062","I have a pretty sweet gig
working in waste management."
1355,"01:33:27,097","01:33:30,065","Well, Captain, I do
owe you a promotion."
1356,"01:33:30,100","01:33:32,837",How's Major Elita sound?
1357,"01:33:32,872","01:33:35,400",How about Commander?
1358,"01:33:35,435","01:33:37,369",Even better.
1359,"01:33:37,404","01:33:41,340","And I'm sorry, B, but I cannot
let you go back to sublevel 50."
1360,"01:33:41,375","01:33:43,177","I may be a Prime now,"
1361,"01:33:43,212","01:33:44,915","but I'm gonna need
you by my side."
1362,"01:33:44,950","01:33:48,413","Are you serious? This is
the greatest day of my life."
1363,"01:33:48,448","01:33:50,613","I get to work for
the government."
1364,"01:33:50,648","01:33:54,254",Okay. So that's new.
1365,"01:33:54,289","01:33:55,926","I'm sorry, what is happening?"
1366,"01:34:26,354","01:34:30,092","And now we stand here
together as one..."
1367,"01:34:32,492","01:34:35,625","proving we all have
the power to transform,"
1368,"01:34:35,660","01:34:38,870","to become who we
were destined to be,"
1369,"01:34:38,905","01:34:43,567","to right wrongs, to
make our world better."
1370,"01:34:43,602","01:34:46,746","Because here,
freedom and autonomy"
1371,"01:34:46,781","01:34:49,474","are the rights of
all sentient beings."
1372,"01:34:50,576","01:34:55,051","Here, all are truly Autobots."
1373,"01:34:56,516","01:35:00,122","This message is a warning
to all Quintessons."
1374,"01:35:00,157","01:35:05,523","If you dare return to Cybertron,
the Autobots will be waiting."
1375,"01:35:05,558","01:35:08,460",I will be waiting.
1376,"01:35:08,495","01:35:12,299",I am Optimus Prime.
1377,"01:35:40,197","01:35:42,659","Hey, guys! Great news,
the Energon's back!"
1378,"01:35:42,694","01:35:44,936","And I have a cog
and I can transform!"
1379,"01:35:44,971","01:35:46,872","It's a long story.
I'll fill you in later."
1380,"01:35:46,907","01:35:50,436","Oh! And here's the best part.
My hands are straight-up knives."
1381,"01:35:50,471","01:35:52,273",Watch this. Knife hands!
1382,"01:35:54,178","01:35:55,210",No!
1383,"01:43:20,052","01:43:23,955",Sentinel the betrayer is dead.
1384,"01:43:23,990","01:43:27,695","But his death has given
life to a new enemy."
1385,"01:43:27,730","01:43:29,895",A stronger enemy.
1386,"01:43:29,930","01:43:32,029",A personal enemy.
1387,"01:43:33,164","01:43:37,342","We will not be blinded
by his deception."
1388,"01:43:37,377","01:43:40,004",We are the ones who are...
1389,"01:43:40,842","01:43:42,842",Decepticons!
1390,"01:43:42,877","01:43:44,679",Rise up!
1391,"01:43:44,714","01:43:48,177",Rise up! Rise up!
