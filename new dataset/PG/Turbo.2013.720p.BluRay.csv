gaining on the pack."

is making quite an impression"

here at the Motor Speedway."
6,"00:01:20,160","00:01:21,999","In all my years of racing,"
7,"00:01:22,000","00:01:24,844","I've never seen a driver
with this much raw talent."
8,"00:01:25,000","00:01:26,079",But what's this?
9,"00:01:26,080","00:01:28,686","Out of nowhere, a dark horse
is challenging Gagné."
10,"00:01:28,840","00:01:30,080",He's gaining on the pack.
11,"00:01:30,240","00:01:31,799",And down the front stretch.
12,"00:01:31,800","00:01:34,804","Moving into fourth position...
third... Now, second!"
13,"00:01:34,960","00:01:36,769","Going to the outside
as they cross the bricks!"
14,"00:01:36,920","00:01:39,764","And it looks like
the winner is Turbo!"
15,"00:01:39,920","00:01:43,163",Amazing! Unbelievable!

18,"00:01:54,360","00:01:55,441","Welcome back, race fans."
19,"00:01:55,600","00:01:57,967","We're here with Indy's
brightest new star, Guy Gagné."
20,"00:01:58,120","00:02:01,044","Tell us, Guy, what inspired
you to become a race driver?"
21,"00:02:01,200","00:02:06,240","You know, Dan, everybody's got that
one thing that makes them happy."
22,"00:02:07,000","00:02:10,607","And for me, it's terrifying,
terrifying blazing speed."

24,"00:02:13,120","00:02:14,884","- One at a time, please.
- Theo!"
25,"00:02:15,040","00:02:16,963","Yes, the handsome
fellow in the back."
26,"00:02:17,400","00:02:18,890",What are you doing?
27,"00:02:19,200","00:02:21,771","What I've always done. Stay
focused, try to run my race."
28,"00:02:21,920","00:02:24,127","That's all any driver can do.
Next question."
29,"00:02:24,440","00:02:26,681",Can you please go to sleep?
30,"00:02:26,840","00:02:28,285",We've got work tomorrow.
31,"00:02:28,440","00:02:29,487",Sleep? Are you kidding me?
32,"00:02:29,640","00:02:31,642","It takes hours to come down
after a big race like this."
33,"00:02:31,800","00:02:33,529","Yeah, I bet. Okay."
34,"00:02:34,520","00:02:37,569","They are the fuel
that keeps me running!"
35,"00:02:37,760","00:02:40,161","Guy, when you were just a rookie
starting out in the Indy Lights,"
36,"00:02:40,320","00:02:42,687","did you ever dream that you'd
be standing here today?"
37,"00:02:42,840","00:02:46,083","Well, as my dear father
always told me,"
38,"00:02:46,240","00:02:50,290","""No dream is too big,
and no dreamer"

42,"00:03:24,800","00:03:27,690","Yes! Seventeen minutes!
That's a new record!"
43,"00:03:28,080","00:03:29,445",Whoo-hoo! Theo!
44,"00:03:38,040","00:03:39,121",Good morning.
45,"00:03:46,600","00:03:50,650","Let's go, people!
Pick it up!"
46,"00:03:53,200","00:03:55,806","Turbo, ready to make his move."
47,"00:03:55,960","00:03:57,999","Did you see that?
She cut me off!"
48,"00:03:58,000","00:04:01,004",Ah! The joys of racing.
49,"00:04:01,160","00:04:03,845","How could anyone not see the appeal
of watching a bunch of cars,"
50,"00:04:04,000","00:04:06,526","drive around in circles
for hours on end?"
51,"00:04:06,720","00:04:08,688","Left turn!
Left turn! Left turn!"
52,"00:04:08,840","00:04:10,683","Your ignorance
saddens me to no end."
53,"00:04:10,840","00:04:12,359","Left turn!
""What do I do here?"""

59,"00:04:23,960","00:04:28,807","And so begins another wonderful
work week at the plant."
60,"00:04:35,280","00:04:38,727","All right, people, we got a lot
of tomatoes to harvest today."
61,"00:04:38,920","00:04:42,163","We got to pick them, we got to
sort them, we got to eat them."
62,"00:04:42,320","00:04:45,164","But most importantly,
we got to be..."
63,"00:04:45,320","00:04:46,321",Safe.
64,"00:04:46,480","00:04:49,051",Yes! Music to my ears.

66,"00:04:51,320","00:04:52,599",Nice curves.
67,"00:04:52,600","00:04:57,208","Oh! You are one giant,
juicy temptress."
68,"00:04:57,800","00:05:00,041",Mmm. Big Red.
69,"00:05:00,600","00:05:02,489",Any day now.
70,"00:05:04,920","00:05:06,570",Any day now.
71,"00:05:08,400","00:05:09,686",Overripe!

76,"00:05:25,960","00:05:27,246",Bring it on.
77,"00:05:31,960","00:05:33,962",Whoa! Not this time.
78,"00:05:44,840","00:05:46,399","And the cars are
at the starting line."
79,"00:05:46,400","00:05:47,970","Gagné's in
the top pole position,"
80,"00:05:48,160","00:05:50,561","driving his trademark
number one overripe tomato."
81,"00:05:50,720","00:05:53,087","Next to him is that feisty
young upstart, Turbo."
82,"00:05:53,240","00:05:56,403","Gentlemen, start your engines."
83,"00:05:57,000","00:05:58,445","Gagné rolls into the lead
around the first turn"
84,"00:05:58,600","00:06:01,001","with Turbo hot on his tail
into the straightaway."
85,"00:06:01,160","00:06:03,083","Hey, there he goes again."
86,"00:06:03,240","00:06:06,239","And down the homestretch,
the crowd goes wild!"
87,"00:06:06,240","00:06:07,359","Go, Turbo!"
88,"00:06:07,360","00:06:10,443","They're neck and neck!
Gagné, Turbo! Turbo, Gagné!"
89,"00:06:10,640","00:06:14,042","- And it looks like the winner is...
- Turbo!"
90,"00:06:14,640","00:06:15,919",Oh! So close!
91,"00:06:15,920","00:06:17,281",It's a photo finish!

knock it off."
94,"00:06:28,920","00:06:31,890","Talk to your brother, Chet.
Or I will."
95,"00:06:32,040","00:06:33,166","I'm on it, Carl."
96,"00:06:33,320","00:06:34,924",This will not happen again.
97,"00:06:35,040","00:06:36,929","Uh-huh.
Heard that before."
98,"00:06:37,160","00:06:38,519",Okay.
99,"00:06:42,040","00:06:43,565",That's lunch!
100,"00:06:58,800","00:07:01,167","You do this to yourself,
you know."
101,"00:07:03,080","00:07:04,730","I mean, look at you."
102,"00:07:05,320","00:07:07,402","How could they
not make fun of you?"
103,"00:07:07,560","00:07:09,722","It's like you're
almost forcing them."
104,"00:07:10,520","00:07:13,763","If you'd just quit
it with the speed stuff..."
105,"00:07:13,920","00:07:15,126",I can't help it.
106,"00:07:15,560","00:07:16,721",It's in me.
107,"00:07:16,880","00:07:18,291","Mmm, no.
It is not ""in"" you."
108,"00:07:18,440","00:07:19,519",Says who?
109,"00:07:19,520","00:07:22,399",Nature. Mother Nature.

our limitations, Theo."
112,"00:07:26,920","00:07:29,359","And the sooner
you accept the dull,"
113,"00:07:29,360","00:07:31,931","miserable reality
of your existence,"
114,"00:07:32,120","00:07:34,282",the happier you'll be.
115,"00:07:34,720","00:07:38,441","Wow. Aren't you just a

crusher, two o' clock!"
117,"00:07:49,440","00:07:51,442","All right, people,
you know the drill."
118,"00:07:51,600","00:07:53,090",Tuck and roll!
119,"00:07:55,960","00:07:58,531","Can't tuck.
I can't tuck!"
120,"00:08:02,760","00:08:04,569","Theo, tuck and roll!"
121,"00:08:04,760","00:08:06,519","We've been over this.
I don't tuck and roll."
122,"00:08:06,520","00:08:09,000","You have a shell
for a reason. Use it."
123,"00:08:09,160","00:08:10,491",You use it.
124,"00:08:10,640","00:08:12,563","I mean, come on, he's not
even looking this way."
125,"00:08:12,760","00:08:15,001","Hey, Juice Box, nice tricycle!"
126,"00:08:15,160","00:08:16,241",You see what I'm saying?
127,"00:08:21,840","00:08:23,171","All right, good hustle."

193,"00:11:35,240","00:11:38,881","Okay, enough
with the crazy talk, Theo."
194,"00:11:39,040","00:11:41,964","Just step away from the
grass and get back to work."
195,"00:11:42,120","00:11:43,201",Theo!
196,"00:11:43,480","00:11:45,323","And the cars are
at the starting line."
197,"00:11:47,720","00:11:49,961","Gentlemen, start your engines."
198,"00:11:56,960","00:11:59,201","And once again,
it's Turbo out front."
199,"00:12:02,240","00:12:05,687",No dream is too big.

the winner is..."

gotten yourself killed!"
207,"00:13:04,160","00:13:05,924","Theo, what were you thinking?"
208,"00:13:11,880","00:13:13,723",I thought I could get there.

270,"00:21:57,400","00:22:03,043","I admit that there's been a wee
bit of damage to inventory, here,"

let me explain..."
272,"00:22:04,800","00:22:05,926",You're fired!

You're fired."
276,"00:22:14,880","00:22:19,761","""You,"" plural. Youse.
Y'all. Both of you!"
277,"00:22:27,440","00:22:30,683",Chet. I'm so sorry.

282,"00:22:44,280","00:22:46,442","and this is what
I get in return."
283,"00:22:46,600","00:22:49,604","Dragged down with you
on your sinking ship."
284,"00:22:49,800","00:22:53,407","A nice, comfy deck chair
on the S.S. Theo!"

know is, the other night,"
289,"00:23:00,640","00:23:02,881","I'm standing above the 101,
and all of a sudden..."
290,"00:23:03,040","00:23:04,999",It was a rhetorical question!
291,"00:23:06,120","00:23:07,167",Chet!

wake up any minute now."

297,"00:24:06,520","00:24:09,444","Easy now, fellas. You
really don't wanna do this."
298,"00:24:14,960","00:24:16,166",Chet!
299,"00:24:41,160","00:24:45,927","Am I dead?
Is this heaven?"
300,"00:24:46,080","00:24:48,242",I pictured it cleaner.
301,"00:24:48,400","00:24:49,731","Come on, get up."
302,"00:24:49,840","00:24:53,925","Theo. Whoa.
The crows got you, too."
303,"00:24:54,080","00:24:57,319","What? No, Chet, it wasn't the crows.
It was..."
304,"00:24:58,880","00:25:00,405",Look at this place.
305,"00:25:00,600","00:25:03,365","Broken glass, rusty nails.
Breathe."
306,"00:25:03,560","00:25:05,801","Discarded salt packets!
A few, yeah."
307,"00:25:05,960","00:25:08,167",It's like a minefield out here.
308,"00:25:09,640","00:25:12,325","Oh! Oh, no. I've got tetanus.
I've got tetanus."
309,"00:25:12,480","00:25:15,051",My jaw is locking up.
310,"00:25:15,640","00:25:19,440","Chet, will you calm down?
There is no reason to panic."
311,"00:25:19,600","00:25:23,439","Everything's
gonna be just fine."
312,"00:25:24,600","00:25:29,003","Well, well, well. Buenas noches,
little amigos."
313,"00:25:29,600","00:25:31,807",This must be my lucky day.

317,"00:26:23,560","00:26:24,607","Well, well, well."
318,"00:26:24,760","00:26:26,239","Somebody better call the cops,"
319,"00:26:26,240","00:26:28,447","because I'm about to
make a killing."
320,"00:26:28,720","00:26:29,801",Killing?
321,"00:26:29,960","00:26:32,361",What'd he drag in this time?
322,"00:26:33,160","00:26:36,130","Ha! Whiplash is
going to eat them up."
323,"00:26:36,360","00:26:38,601",It's gonna be a slaughter.
324,"00:26:38,760","00:26:40,679","Mm-hmm, dead meat."
325,"00:26:42,040","00:26:43,530","We're gonna die.
We're gonna die."
326,"00:26:48,280","00:26:50,123",Oh! Oh!

Now, hurry up."
328,"00:26:57,760","00:27:01,367","A little far from home
aren't you, garden snail?"
329,"00:27:01,480","00:27:05,166","Hey, I
think we got a crier here."
330,"00:27:05,840","00:27:07,285",Let's do this!

share your gift with the world."
386,"00:30:02,880","00:30:05,042","Great. Then first
thing in the morning,"
387,"00:30:05,240","00:30:09,529","get in that truck
and go sell some tacos."
388,"00:30:10,800","00:30:12,404",Tito.
389,"00:30:19,720","00:30:22,246","You sure you had enough to eat?
Are you tired?"
390,"00:30:22,400","00:30:25,563","Here, I made up your bed."
391,"00:30:26,400","00:30:29,563","Now, it might get
a little chilly tonight."
392,"00:30:29,760","00:30:31,171","So, I warmed up your blanket."
393,"00:30:32,480","00:30:36,326","There you go.
All comfy and cozy."
394,"00:30:37,280","00:30:41,285","Sweet dreams, Little Amigo.
I'll see you in the morning."
395,"00:30:42,920","00:30:45,571","Did he really just
kiss you goodnight?"
396,"00:30:45,720","00:30:47,643",He did. Jealous?
397,"00:30:51,960","00:30:54,122","Question. What gives
with the super-speed?"
398,"00:30:54,280","00:30:55,645","Hey, hey, you a robot?"
399,"00:30:55,800","00:30:57,006","Are you radioactive, homie?"
400,"00:30:57,160","00:30:58,319",Is it contagious?
401,"00:30:58,320","00:31:00,448",Give the kid some space.
402,"00:31:01,600","00:31:05,082","I'm Whiplash. And
this here is my crew."
403,"00:31:05,240","00:31:07,811",I'm Skidmark!
404,"00:31:09,240","00:31:11,083",Ah. yeah!
405,"00:31:11,240","00:31:14,722","And I'm Burn.
Sizzle, sizzle, uh-uh."
406,"00:31:14,880","00:31:17,850","The name is Smoove Move. I set
the tone around here, you dig?"
407,"00:31:18,000","00:31:19,411","Now check this.
Right about now,"
408,"00:31:19,600","00:31:23,759","I'm moving so fast, the whole
world's going in slow motion, baby."
409,"00:31:23,760","00:31:25,125",Whoa...
410,"00:31:25,640","00:31:28,041","Here one second, gone the next."
411,"00:31:28,240","00:31:30,288",They call me the White Shadow!
412,"00:31:30,440","00:31:34,240","Because I'm so fast,
all you see is my shadow."
413,"00:31:35,080","00:31:36,161",I don't get it.
414,"00:31:36,800","00:31:39,007","I'm fast, like a shadow!"
415,"00:31:39,600","00:31:42,604","Yeah, but shadows,
they're not inherently fast."
416,"00:31:43,160","00:31:45,481",White Shadow...
417,"00:31:45,640","00:31:46,687",I can still see you.
418,"00:31:46,800","00:31:48,639","Listen, garden snail,
you clearly"
419,"00:31:48,640","00:31:50,529","got the skills
to pay the bills."
420,"00:31:50,880","00:31:53,281","If snails had to
pay bills, that is."
421,"00:31:53,440","00:31:54,965",You would be able to pay them.
422,"00:31:55,120","00:31:56,610","Yeah, bills."
423,"00:31:56,760","00:31:58,171","Paid in full, son."
424,"00:31:58,320","00:32:02,039","So, I'm here to invite
you to join our crew."
425,"00:32:03,480","00:32:04,686",Join your crew?
426,"00:32:05,400","00:32:07,607",Did I say something humorous?
427,"00:32:07,760","00:32:10,650","I'm sorry. It's just that
you guys are, you know,"
428,"00:32:10,800","00:32:13,239",kind of slow-ish.
429,"00:32:13,240","00:32:15,163",Oh! Really? To our faces?
430,"00:32:15,320","00:32:17,163","Theo, what are you doing?"
431,"00:32:17,320","00:32:21,882","Now, I'm gonna pretend I didn't
hear what I clearly just heard."
432,"00:32:22,080","00:32:24,401","Heard what?
I didn't hear anything."
433,"00:32:24,560","00:32:26,289","Nothing out of order,
did you, Theo?"
434,"00:32:26,440","00:32:27,519","Oh, I meant what I said."
435,"00:32:27,520","00:32:29,919","Then you better put your
money where your mouth is."
436,"00:32:29,920","00:32:31,285",Snails don't have money.
437,"00:32:31,440","00:32:34,284","Otherwise, we'd be able to
pay the bills. Remember?"
438,"00:32:34,440","00:32:36,602","Your trash talk is
needlessly complicated."
439,"00:32:36,760","00:32:41,288","Is it? Or is it that your
unpaid bills are overdue?"
440,"00:32:41,480","00:32:45,485","Enough talk.
It's time for action."
441,"00:32:46,360","00:32:50,490","It's simple. First one to the
top of that shooting star"
442,"00:32:51,080","00:32:52,730",wins.
443,"00:32:52,880","00:32:56,043","You guys? Way up there, huh?
Awesome."
444,"00:32:56,240","00:32:58,239","Let me get my calendar
so I can time you."
445,"00:32:58,240","00:33:00,049","Oh, you got jokes, rookie?"
446,"00:33:00,200","00:33:02,407","Laugh it up, garden snail."
447,"00:33:02,560","00:33:04,039",On your mark...
448,"00:33:05,240","00:33:07,004",Get yourself set...
449,"00:33:07,160","00:33:10,369",Prepare to be White Shadowed!
450,"00:33:13,040","00:33:14,087",Whoa!
451,"00:33:15,920","00:33:16,921",Yeah!
452,"00:33:17,920","00:33:19,079",Whoo!
453,"00:33:19,080","00:33:20,605",Yeah! Bam!
454,"00:33:21,920","00:33:23,079",Coming through!
455,"00:33:23,080","00:33:24,764","Oh! Those guys
are crazy!"
456,"00:33:24,920","00:33:26,684",Those guys are awesome.
457,"00:33:28,400","00:33:31,006","Hey, player!
The party up here!"
458,"00:33:31,160","00:33:32,321",Whoo!
459,"00:33:37,680","00:33:38,761",How do I get up there?
460,"00:33:54,600","00:33:55,886",Later!
461,"00:33:56,800","00:33:57,801",Oh!
462,"00:34:10,760","00:34:11,921",Coming through!
463,"00:34:12,840","00:34:13,921",Yeah!
464,"00:34:15,360","00:34:18,967","Who's ""slow-ish"" now, garden snail?"
465,"00:34:23,440","00:34:26,284","Today, everything changes!"
466,"00:34:28,640","00:34:30,961","Tito, what are you doing?"
467,"00:34:31,120","00:34:33,009","Planning a ""taco-volution""!"
468,"00:34:33,160","00:34:36,846","It's a little concept that I came up with.
When you combine the words..."
469,"00:34:37,000","00:34:39,765","""Taco"" and ""revolution.""
I get it."
470,"00:34:39,920","00:34:42,491","But how is that supposed
to help us sell tacos?"
471,"00:34:42,680","00:34:47,079","Patience, bro. Taco-volutions
don't happen in a day."
472,"00:34:47,080","00:34:48,199","Tacos, I say"
473,"00:34:48,200","00:34:50,919",Talking about a taco-volution
474,"00:34:50,920","00:34:52,888","Sauce and chips
Mmm. .."
475,"00:34:55,320","00:34:57,759","And next up
on our tour is the L.A. River."
476,"00:34:57,760","00:34:58,959","Oh, Oh, Oh!"
477,"00:34:58,960","00:35:00,610",Famous for its appearance...
478,"00:35:03,960","00:35:05,928",Get! Get out!
479,"00:35:13,760","00:35:17,845","Sorry, Paz. Can
you throw that up here?"
480,"00:35:18,200","00:35:20,487","Coming to getcha!
I'm coming to getcha!"
481,"00:35:20,680","00:35:21,681",Bye.
482,"00:35:21,800","00:35:23,719",Hey!
483,"00:35:23,720","00:35:26,371","Valley Hobby, this is
Bobby, how can I help you?"
484,"00:35:27,280","00:35:30,727","No, you got the wrong number.
Yeah, okay."
485,"00:35:32,280","00:35:34,362",That's what I'm talking about!
486,"00:35:34,560","00:35:37,882","You want Jackson Five on your feet?
One Jackson per toe."
487,"00:35:39,040","00:35:41,884","Sure, knock yourself out."
488,"00:35:53,080","00:35:55,321",Can't get no better.
489,"00:36:23,800","00:36:25,040",Mmm!
490,"00:36:27,840","00:36:30,923","Okay. So,
what's your plan, huh?"
491,"00:36:31,120","00:36:34,249","Stay here in this
rundown strip mall?"
492,"00:36:34,760","00:36:36,762","With a bunch of lunatic snails,"
493,"00:36:36,960","00:36:41,602","and a nutso taco man who is
using you to sell Mexican food?"
494,"00:36:41,800","00:36:46,283","Because if that's your plan, then
whoopty-skippy-do, sign me up!"
495,"00:36:46,440","00:36:50,889","My ears are burning. I hope
you're not talking about me."
496,"00:36:51,640","00:36:54,450","You two seem to have a special
connection, Little Amigo,"
497,"00:36:54,600","00:36:58,491","and Snail Who Seems To Be
Friends With Little Amigo."
498,"00:36:58,640","00:36:59,839",Is this your mother?
499,"00:36:59,840","00:37:02,127",Your sister?
500,"00:37:02,800","00:37:06,964","Oh! Say no more.
It's your girlfriend."
501,"00:37:10,160","00:37:12,128","Ah, she's a cutie."
502,"00:37:12,480","00:37:13,561",Ow!
503,"00:37:14,480","00:37:15,481",Hmm.
504,"00:37:18,160","00:37:20,319",Women.
505,"00:37:21,600","00:37:23,170","I have to admit,"
506,"00:37:23,320","00:37:26,767","I was kind of hoping the taco-volution
would've started by now."
507,"00:37:32,680","00:37:34,125",It doesn't make sense.
508,"00:37:34,280","00:37:36,760","With my brains and your speed,"
509,"00:37:36,920","00:37:39,924","we should be destined
for greatness, right?"
510,"00:37:40,960","00:37:42,962","We need to think big,
Little Amigo."
511,"00:37:43,120","00:37:47,205","I'm talking commercials,
talk shows, county fairs."
512,"00:37:48,360","00:37:51,364","Flea markets. No, farmers' markets.
No, supermarkets."
513,"00:37:51,600","00:37:53,443",We'll cover all the markets.
514,"00:37:54,840","00:37:57,844","Quinceañeras,
confirmations, graduations."
515,"00:37:58,080","00:38:00,367",The Indy 500.
516,"00:38:00,880","00:38:04,407","Ooh, I got it. We can have
our very own telenovela!"
517,"00:38:04,560","00:38:06,164",What? No.
518,"00:38:18,720","00:38:20,165",Oh...
519,"00:38:20,520","00:38:21,999",Whoo!
520,"00:38:22,000","00:38:24,924","This is it, Chet. I knew we
ended up here for a reason."
521,"00:38:25,080","00:38:26,969","Will you just
slow down for a second?"
522,"00:38:27,440","00:38:31,240","Slow down? Are you kidding?
I'm never going slow again!"
523,"00:38:31,400","00:38:33,004","Theo, stop. Oh!"
524,"00:38:34,640","00:38:36,529",What are you trying to say?
525,"00:38:36,680","00:38:39,081","I wanna enter him
in the Indy 500."
526,"00:38:39,240","00:38:41,891","The Indy 500?
What are you talking about?"
527,"00:38:42,040","00:38:43,280",What is he talking about?
528,"00:38:43,440","00:38:46,046","Now, look, I know it may
sound a little crazy..."
529,"00:38:46,200","00:38:48,771","No, no, no, Tito,
that doesn't sound crazy."
530,"00:38:48,960","00:38:52,521","Dos Bros Tacos and Sushi.
That was crazy."
531,"00:38:52,720","00:38:54,324",What? People love sushi.
532,"00:38:54,480","00:38:59,281","Dos Bros Tacos and Monkey Petting Zoo.
That was crazy."
533,"00:38:59,480","00:39:01,847","The babies were cute.
The adults were just so mean."
534,"00:39:02,000","00:39:05,561","Taco Man and his sidekick,
the Churro."
535,"00:39:05,760","00:39:07,959","Oh, that was
off-the-hook crazy!"
536,"00:39:07,960","00:39:09,530",Crazy awesome.
537,"00:39:09,680","00:39:14,607","But this, Tito? This is in
a category all by itself."
538,"00:39:14,760","00:39:15,921","Angelo, please."
539,"00:39:16,120","00:39:18,122","Come on, Chet.
Just hear me out."
540,"00:39:18,280","00:39:22,080","Theo, a snail cannot race in a
competition meant for cars."
541,"00:39:22,240","00:39:23,685",There are rules.
542,"00:39:23,880","00:39:25,644","Actually, I've been doing
a lot of research,"
543,"00:39:25,840","00:39:27,439","and there's
nothing in the rules"
544,"00:39:27,440","00:39:28,960","that says a snail
can't enter the race."
545,"00:39:29,080","00:39:31,731","There's nothing that says this
sponge can't enter the race either,"
546,"00:39:31,880","00:39:34,201","but that doesn't mean
it's ever gonna happen."
547,"00:39:34,360","00:39:36,567","Millions of people watch that race.
Uh-huh."
548,"00:39:36,720","00:39:38,370","This could put us
on the map, bro."
549,"00:39:38,560","00:39:39,959","Trying to work, here."
550,"00:39:39,960","00:39:41,291","Oh, come on, Angelo."
551,"00:39:41,480","00:39:43,959","All we have to do is raise the
$20,000 registration fee."
552,"00:39:43,960","00:39:45,079",What?
553,"00:39:45,080","00:39:47,048","I figured, once we sell the truck...
Sell the..."
554,"00:39:47,200","00:39:49,521","Are you even listening
to yourself, Tito?"
555,"00:39:49,680","00:39:54,846","You want to invest our entire
life savings in a snail!"
556,"00:39:55,000","00:39:58,482","I'm telling you, this snail crawled
into our lives for a reason."
557,"00:39:59,400","00:40:02,210","I think he could be
our little shooting star."
558,"00:40:02,360","00:40:04,522","Did you hear that, Chet?
This guy believes in me."
559,"00:40:04,680","00:40:06,682","That guy is as
crazy as you are."
560,"00:40:06,880","00:40:08,450","They'll never let
you into that race."
561,"00:40:08,600","00:40:11,126","And even if they did,
you wouldn't survive one lap."
562,"00:40:11,280","00:40:12,691","Yeah, but...
Angelo, listen..."
563,"00:40:12,840","00:40:13,841","Tito!
Theo!"
564,"00:40:14,080","00:40:16,606","Not every dream is
meant to come true."
565,"00:40:16,760","00:40:19,604","Yeah, what he said."
566,"00:40:21,880","00:40:25,089",A snail in the Indy 500.
567,"00:40:25,840","00:40:28,446",What will you think of next?
568,"00:40:35,840","00:40:39,439","Don't worry, Little Amigo.
We'll get that entrance fee somehow."
569,"00:40:43,840","00:40:44,841",Hmm.
570,"00:40:47,200","00:40:49,279","Now, I know some people may say"
571,"00:40:49,280","00:40:51,408","$20,000 sounds
like a lot of money."
572,"00:40:51,560","00:40:52,721",It is a lot of money.
573,"00:40:52,880","00:40:56,089","And I know some people
may say I'm crazy."
574,"00:40:56,240","00:41:00,643","But I say, when a snail crawls into
your life at 200 miles an hour,"
575,"00:41:00,800","00:41:03,406","then you'd have to be crazy
not to grab onto that shell,"
576,"00:41:03,600","00:41:05,523",and take a ride of a lifetime.
577,"00:41:05,640","00:41:08,928","Now, in case you're
still not convinced..."
578,"00:41:09,080","00:41:12,129","Boom! Check out my well-designed
endorsement poster."
579,"00:41:13,880","00:41:18,010","...are the
champions, my friends..."
580,"00:41:20,440","00:41:22,204","What's your point, Tito?"
581,"00:41:23,400","00:41:26,961","My point is, we got a chance to
change our lives for the better."
582,"00:41:27,120","00:41:31,205","To make Starlight Plaza the great
place we all know it could be."
583,"00:41:31,360","00:41:32,407","Now, come on."
584,"00:41:32,560","00:41:37,009","Who's ready to sponsor
the next Indy 500 champion?"
585,"00:41:41,200","00:41:44,170","Sorry, Tito, but
I've got work to do."
586,"00:41:44,880","00:41:48,123","No, you don't.
None of you do."
587,"00:41:49,480","00:41:51,847","I don't get it.
That poster was awesome."
588,"00:41:53,280","00:41:57,080","Oh, well, good try, you did your best.
Time to go home, Theo."
589,"00:41:57,400","00:42:00,370","Oh, we're going
to Indianapolis, Chet."
590,"00:42:00,520","00:42:03,444","Don't you worry your chubby
little face about that."
591,"00:42:04,480","00:42:05,606","All right, team."
592,"00:42:08,120","00:42:10,009",Snail up!
593,"00:42:12,480","00:42:15,051","And next up
on our tour is the L.A. River."
594,"00:42:15,200","00:42:17,999","Famous for its appearance
in such movies as..."
595,"00:42:18,000","00:42:19,959","You've just been
White Shadowed!"
596,"00:42:19,960","00:42:21,644","Oh!
Whoo!"
597,"00:42:22,240","00:42:24,279","Next stop is
the Starlight Plaza."
598,"00:42:28,560","00:42:29,641",Yes!
599,"00:42:32,200","00:42:34,282","Burn. Let's get
this party started."
600,"00:42:34,440","00:42:35,771",You know it.
601,"00:42:39,000","00:42:40,047",Snailed it.
602,"00:42:40,160","00:42:41,924","Skidmark. You bringing
the beverages?"
603,"00:42:42,240","00:42:45,687","Oh, I got a beverage for you.
And a beverage for you."
604,"00:42:53,720","00:42:56,644","Light her up, Turbo.
Do your thing, baby."
605,"00:43:03,160","00:43:06,050","Hey, Angelo!
We got customers."
606,"00:43:06,200","00:43:07,326",Whoa!
607,"00:43:14,080","00:43:15,730","Okay, you ready?"
608,"00:43:16,960","00:43:18,159",Go!
609,"00:43:21,960","00:43:22,961",Huh?
610,"00:43:26,200","00:43:29,124","All right.
You're good to go."
611,"00:43:29,280","00:43:31,521","Okay, everybody.
Back on the bus."
612,"00:43:31,800","00:43:33,643","Oh, Mama, you look good!"
613,"00:43:33,840","00:43:36,810","Bye. Come again. I do
weddings, bar mitzvahs."
614,"00:43:36,960","00:43:38,405","Thank you.
Come back soon."
615,"00:43:38,560","00:43:40,722","Tomorrow, later on today.
I'll be here."
616,"00:43:41,040","00:43:42,530","Good luck with
that snail of yours."
617,"00:43:42,720","00:43:44,165","Thank you, my friend."
618,"00:43:44,320","00:43:45,845","I gotta hand it to you, Tito."
619,"00:43:46,000","00:43:48,731","For once, one of your
crazy schemes worked."
620,"00:43:48,840","00:43:49,959",I know!
621,"00:43:49,960","00:43:52,327","And, hey, if we did better
because of that billboard,"
622,"00:43:52,520","00:43:54,966","just imagine what
the Indy 500 could do."
623,"00:43:55,120","00:43:57,327","Hey, don't go crazy on me."
624,"00:43:57,480","00:44:00,927","We had a good day.
We sold a few extra tacos."
625,"00:44:01,080","00:44:03,321",It's good enough.
626,"00:44:20,600","00:44:23,206","You better not mess this up, Tito.
Mmm-hmm."
627,"00:44:25,600","00:44:26,681","Oh, no."
628,"00:44:26,840","00:44:29,923","Oh, yes. We're going to
Indianapolis, Chet!"
629,"00:44:30,080","00:44:34,639","""I"" to the ""N"" to the ""Dizzy""
to the ""Wizzah."" You dig?"
630,"00:44:34,640","00:44:36,085","Yes, sir."
631,"00:44:37,000","00:44:39,924","One breakfast burrito, please."
632,"00:44:44,760","00:44:48,481","That's it. I'm sorry, honey.
Today is the day."
633,"00:44:53,200","00:44:56,124",Tito!
634,"00:45:00,000","00:45:01,001","Are you ready, big man?"
635,"00:45:01,160","00:45:03,766","On three. One, two..."
636,"00:45:04,960","00:45:07,645","Indy, baby!"
637,"00:45:27,480","00:45:28,559","Oh, oh!"
638,"00:45:28,560","00:45:30,767","I got it! ""Fasty""!"
639,"00:45:30,920","00:45:32,331",Are you kidding me?
640,"00:45:36,000","00:45:37,001",Huh?
641,"00:45:37,480","00:45:38,527",Oh!
642,"00:45:38,760","00:45:40,171","""Turbo""!"
643,"00:45:41,680","00:45:45,446","All right, as the kids say,
""Time to plump your ride."""
644,"00:45:45,840","00:45:47,683","Oh, heck, no!"
645,"00:45:49,800","00:45:51,484",Let's do this.
646,"00:45:51,680","00:45:53,921","Now, that's more like it."
647,"00:46:05,440","00:46:07,879",No twitching. Voilà!
648,"00:46:07,880","00:46:09,319",Ooh-wee!
649,"00:46:09,320","00:46:12,244","Suited and booted, gooted and
looted, dipped and whipped!"
650,"00:46:12,400","00:46:14,607","We've got a contender, baby!"
651,"00:46:22,680","00:46:24,887","Oh, look at him go!"
652,"00:46:38,760","00:46:39,879",Ah.
653,"00:46:39,880","00:46:40,881","Fresh air, baby."
654,"00:46:41,040","00:46:43,439",We ain't in Van Nuys no more.
655,"00:46:43,440","00:46:44,566",Uh-uh.
656,"00:46:54,720","00:46:55,767","Hi, Chet."
657,"00:46:56,360","00:46:57,805",You're gonna be my boyfriend!
658,"00:46:58,360","00:46:59,646","I'm gonna
call you ""boo."""
659,"00:46:59,800","00:47:02,371","""Boo""? What does
that even mean?"
660,"00:47:05,800","00:47:08,599","Sure beats the view
from the garden, huh?"
661,"00:47:10,920","00:47:13,207","I can't believe
you're doing this."
662,"00:47:13,360","00:47:15,886","""We."" We are doing this."
663,"00:47:16,040","00:47:18,566",You. I'm just a hostage.
664,"00:47:19,600","00:47:23,639","Theo, what happens
if you wake up tomorrow,"
665,"00:47:23,640","00:47:26,325","and your powers are gone, hmm?"
666,"00:47:27,080","00:47:29,367",What then?
667,"00:47:32,000","00:47:34,571","Then I better make
the most of today."
668,"00:48:11,920","00:48:14,571","This is even bigger
than Hobby-Con."
669,"00:48:24,120","00:48:26,726","Wow. Now,
that's a car."
670,"00:48:26,920","00:48:29,526",Whoa. Shiny.
671,"00:48:56,840","00:48:57,841",Gagné.
672,"00:49:11,200","00:49:12,531",Whoa!
673,"00:49:21,040","00:49:23,122","And Guy Gagné wins the pole,"
674,"00:49:23,280","00:49:27,410","with a four-lap average
of 230 miles per hour."
675,"00:49:27,680","00:49:29,762",That's Gagné's best time yet.
676,"00:49:30,080","00:49:32,003",Turbo has never gone that fast.
677,"00:49:32,160","00:49:33,491","I mean, yet."
678,"00:49:33,640","00:49:37,247","So, you got a plan, Taco Man?"
679,"00:49:37,400","00:49:39,368",Of course I do.
680,"00:49:40,680","00:49:43,843","Please tell me those phony
glasses are not your plan."
681,"00:49:44,080","00:49:47,527","Uh, no.
That would be ridiculous."
682,"00:49:47,800","00:49:50,087","Come on, phony
glasses, do your thing."
683,"00:49:54,120","00:49:56,964","Oh, this great. I'm gonna
go have heart attack."
684,"00:50:04,320","00:50:07,210","Qué pasa, my friend?"
685,"00:50:07,880","00:50:11,043","I have a driver that I'd
like to enter into the race."
686,"00:50:11,200","00:50:13,123","What team does
your driver race for?"
687,"00:50:13,320","00:50:15,926",Dos Bros Tacos and Company.
688,"00:50:17,880","00:50:19,769",Has he passed the rookie test?
689,"00:50:21,600","00:50:24,490","Hey, come here. Let's
cut to the chase, okay?"
690,"00:50:24,640","00:50:27,371","You have glasses,
I have glasses."
691,"00:50:27,520","00:50:29,602","What do we gotta do
to get this done, bro?"
692,"00:50:29,760","00:50:32,366","Hey, let go.
Come on, man, let go!"
693,"00:50:32,520","00:50:36,320","This is no way to treat a guy with glasses.
I have astigmatism and stuff."
694,"00:50:36,480","00:50:38,479","Yeah, yeah."
695,"00:50:43,000","00:50:44,439","Guy, how do you do it,"
696,"00:50:44,440","00:50:46,959","shattering your own
records year after year?"
697,"00:50:46,960","00:50:50,681","Well, when a cheetah
chases after a gazelle,"
698,"00:50:50,840","00:50:54,208","does he ever stop to think, ""Maybe
I've caught enough gazelles."
699,"00:50:54,400","00:50:57,324","""Maybe I should just settle
down, try the vegan thing."""
700,"00:50:57,480","00:51:00,723","No! He keeps running as long
as his legs will carry him."
701,"00:51:00,880","00:51:04,407","I am like the cheetah.
I never give up."
702,"00:51:04,560","00:51:06,559",Next question.
703,"00:51:08,200","00:51:12,000","All right, give me the keys.
I'll drive the first shift home."
704,"00:51:12,640","00:51:13,926","Whoa!
What gives?"
705,"00:51:19,480","00:51:20,720","No, no, no!"
706,"00:51:23,960","00:51:25,883","Can I help you, monsieur?"
707,"00:51:26,560","00:51:28,244","One second, please."
708,"00:51:28,400","00:51:30,641","What are you doing? Are you
trying to get me arrested?"
709,"00:51:35,400","00:51:36,479",Oh.
710,"00:51:36,480","00:51:39,768","Sorry! So sorry. We'll
have this under control..."
711,"00:51:39,920","00:51:41,604",Ladies and gentlemen!
712,"00:51:41,760","00:51:46,402","I give you the next
Indy 500 champion!"
713,"00:51:46,840","00:51:48,330",Huh? Huh?
714,"00:51:48,800","00:51:51,770",Is that a snail?
715,"00:51:52,000","00:51:55,447",Your driver is a snail?
716,"00:52:02,440","00:52:04,283",What kind of welcome is that?
717,"00:52:04,440","00:52:07,649","I'd say an appropriate
welcome, given the situation."
718,"00:52:07,800","00:52:09,245","All right.
Game over, nut job."
719,"00:52:09,400","00:52:10,599",Let's go.
720,"00:52:10,600","00:52:12,568","Have a nice flight, Chet.
Huh?"
721,"00:52:12,720","00:52:14,290","Hit it!
White Shadow!"
722,"00:52:15,680","00:52:17,011",Bonzai!
723,"00:52:17,840","00:52:18,919",Get off!
724,"00:52:18,920","00:52:20,160","Pedal to the metal, Turbo."
725,"00:52:21,880","00:52:22,961",Go!
726,"00:52:25,400","00:52:26,606",Whoa!
727,"00:52:40,560","00:52:41,641",Yeah!
728,"00:52:42,240","00:52:44,766",Whoa! That snail is fast!
729,"00:53:07,000","00:53:08,439",Whoo!
730,"00:53:08,440","00:53:10,169","What did I miss?
What did I miss?"
731,"00:53:14,920","00:53:18,766","226! Ha-ha! That's fast
enough to qualify!"
732,"00:53:23,320","00:53:25,687",That's what I'm talking about!
733,"00:53:28,960","00:53:32,319","Whoa!
That snail is fast!"
734,"00:53:32,320","00:53:35,290","Oh, man, wait until
people see this!"
735,"00:53:38,960","00:53:43,488","Whoa! That snail is fast!
What? Are you seeing this?"
736,"00:53:45,600","00:53:47,568","- Hello?
- Have you heard?"
737,"00:53:47,720","00:53:49,165","Yes, I've heard."
738,"00:53:49,320","00:53:50,890",That snail is fast.
739,"00:53:51,080","00:53:53,731","Forget about it. This
will blow over by noon."
740,"00:53:53,880","00:53:56,359","Whoa!
That snail is fast!"
741,"00:53:57,920","00:53:59,126","- Hello?
- Have you seen it?"
742,"00:53:59,280","00:54:01,169","Yes, I've seen it!"
743,"00:54:04,760","00:54:07,127","Whoa!
That snail is fast!"
744,"00:54:07,280","00:54:08,361",What?
745,"00:54:09,160","00:54:11,162",Snail is fast!
746,"00:54:11,320","00:54:12,799",You see the snail moving fast
747,"00:54:12,800","00:54:14,165","You slow, you gonna get passed"
748,"00:54:14,320","00:54:16,004","You see him
gaining position for first"
749,"00:54:16,160","00:54:17,161",He won't be last
750,"00:54:17,320","00:54:18,845",He's ready to make a dash
751,"00:54:19,000","00:54:20,604","Snail quicker
than a lightning flash"
752,"00:54:20,760","00:54:22,199","His engine's roaring,
he's flooring"
753,"00:54:22,200","00:54:23,599",He won't run out of gas
754,"00:54:24,680","00:54:26,330","Whoa!
That snail is fast!"
755,"00:54:26,480","00:54:29,370","That snail is fast,
fast, fast, fast, fast"
756,"00:54:30,480","00:54:32,687","Whoa! Are you
seeing this?"
757,"00:54:32,840","00:54:33,959",Whoa!
758,"00:54:33,960","00:54:36,281","You cannot have
a snail in the Indy 500."
759,"00:54:36,440","00:54:38,329","Whoa!
It's a miracle of nature!"

Get your head in the game!"
947,"01:08:21,240","01:08:22,969","Go, go, go!"
948,"01:08:25,960","01:08:28,406","All right, go, go, go!"
949,"01:08:32,080","01:08:34,359","Come on! We're supposed
to be a team, here!"
950,"01:08:34,360","01:08:35,479",We're trying.
951,"01:08:35,480","01:08:38,563","It's a snail. There's
not that much to do."
952,"01:08:38,840","01:08:42,526","That's it. This pit crew is
officially under new management."
953,"01:08:44,680","01:08:47,081","Now, this is how it's done.
Air jack."
954,"01:08:47,240","01:08:48,844",Jack-tivate.
955,"01:08:49,000","01:08:50,359","Lube.
Applied liberally."
956,"01:08:50,360","01:08:51,407",Detailing.
957,"01:08:51,520","01:08:53,045","Wax on, wax off.
Ow!"
958,"01:08:53,200","01:08:54,599","Fuel!
Down the hatch."
959,"01:08:54,600","01:08:55,759",Chug! Chug! Chug!
960,"01:08:55,760","01:08:56,879",Foot massage.
961,"01:08:56,880","01:08:58,599",You know it.
962,"01:08:58,600","01:09:00,090",Relaxing vibes.
963,"01:09:00,280","01:09:02,442","Own it, brother."
964,"01:09:02,600","01:09:05,001","Now, de-lax those vibes!"
965,"01:09:05,240","01:09:06,366",Ahhh! Are you crazy?
966,"01:09:06,560","01:09:08,847","Ow! Yeah, I'm crazy! What
made you think I was sane?"
967,"01:09:09,040","01:09:10,679","I don't
know how to... Ow!"
968,"01:09:10,680","01:09:12,045","Are you a car?
No."
969,"01:09:12,200","01:09:13,759",Are you a car?
970,"01:09:13,760","01:09:14,841",No!
971,"01:09:14,960","01:09:17,281",Then stop driving like one!
972,"01:09:18,480","01:09:20,801","Now get out there.
Snail up, baby!"
973,"01:09:20,960","01:09:22,999","Go, T-boogie, go!"
974,"01:09:29,080","01:09:30,889","Gagné with
a commanding lead now."
975,"01:09:31,040","01:09:34,647","Followed by Claudio Cruz,
Shelby Stone and Takao Noguchi."
976,"01:09:39,080","01:09:41,128","Go!
Come on."
977,"01:09:49,880","01:09:51,450",Snail up.
978,"01:09:57,640","01:09:59,005",Snail up!
979,"01:10:04,360","01:10:05,521",Yes!
980,"01:10:05,720","01:10:09,399","I don't believe it!
Turbo just went under a car!"
981,"01:10:09,400","01:10:11,368","Whoa!
Did you see that?"
982,"01:10:18,520","01:10:22,127","Despite a rocky start, it
looks like Turbo is gaining some ground."
983,"01:10:22,320","01:10:24,482",Yeah! Now we're talking!
984,"01:10:29,400","01:10:32,085","Where is he?
Where is he?"
985,"01:10:47,840","01:10:49,569",Oh! He passed another one!
986,"01:10:49,760","01:10:50,966",Yeah!
987,"01:10:51,760","01:10:54,604","That's my brother, right there.
That's the back of his head!"
988,"01:11:08,240","01:11:10,402","Go, go, go!
Left turn! Left turn!"
989,"01:11:10,560","01:11:12,847",Yeah! Left turn!
990,"01:11:26,560","01:11:30,087","Turbo maneuvers past
Shelby Stone and into second place!"
991,"01:11:30,240","01:11:32,208",He is hot on Gagné's heels!
992,"01:11:32,360","01:11:34,249","The snail's not
going away, Guy."
993,"01:11:34,400","01:11:36,971","All right, I know, I know!"
994,"01:11:46,560","01:11:49,080","These racers better
watch it coming into turn four."
995,"01:11:49,240","01:11:52,244","This late in the race, that
outside edge is full of marbles."
996,"01:11:52,400","01:11:54,801","And you don't want to play
with these marbles, kids."
997,"01:11:54,960","01:11:56,719","That rubber
peeling off the tires"
998,"01:11:56,720","01:11:58,688","can be a minefield
for these drivers."
999,"01:12:00,560","01:12:02,005",Here we go.
1000,"01:12:02,880","01:12:03,881",Whoa!
1001,"01:12:25,880","01:12:26,927",Turbo!
1002,"01:12:27,800","01:12:29,006","Oh, no."
1003,"01:12:34,000","01:12:35,525","Oh, man."
1004,"01:12:35,800","01:12:38,644","What are we gonna do? If he takes
another hit like that last one..."
1005,"01:12:38,800","01:12:41,724","You gotta pull him, Tito."
1006,"01:12:43,800","01:12:47,885","I'm sorry, Little Amigo.
It's over."
1007,"01:12:56,960","01:12:58,007",Hey.
1008,"01:12:58,280","01:13:02,126","We got this far.
It's good enough."
1009,"01:13:05,240","01:13:06,844","No, it's not."
1010,"01:13:09,160","01:13:11,319","With the green
flag about to be waved,"
1011,"01:13:11,320","01:13:13,322","it looks like a mere
formality at this point."
1012,"01:13:13,480","01:13:16,768","Gagné, just five laps
away from victory."
1013,"01:13:16,920","01:13:20,322","Wait a minute! Turbo is
still in this thing!"
1014,"01:13:20,760","01:13:21,761",Huh?
1015,"01:13:32,440","01:13:34,479",What?
1016,"01:13:34,480","01:13:36,399","Whoa!
What happened there?"
1017,"01:13:39,840","01:13:41,319","Come on, come on!"
1018,"01:13:41,320","01:13:42,321",Whoa!
1019,"01:13:48,160","01:13:49,207",No!
1020,"01:13:49,320","01:13:51,322",Theo!
1021,"01:13:55,520","01:13:57,170",No!
1022,"01:13:59,600","01:14:02,126","- Not this time.
- Come on!"
1023,"01:14:09,600","01:14:11,045","Come on, Turbo.
Come on, Turbo."
1024,"01:14:14,360","01:14:17,489","Come on, just hold in
there a little longer."
1025,"01:14:26,240","01:14:27,287",No!
1026,"01:14:36,720","01:14:37,999",No!
1027,"01:14:40,240","01:14:41,890","Farewell, little snail."
1028,"01:14:55,240","01:14:58,479","Unbelievable!
Turbo takes the lead."
1029,"01:14:59,640","01:15:01,244","Snail-style, baby!"
1030,"01:15:01,760","01:15:03,479",Bad idea. Bad idea.
1031,"01:15:05,080","01:15:09,449","And the white flag is in the air as
we enter the 200th and final lap."
1032,"01:15:10,040","01:15:12,801","Turbo weaving between
lapped cars like a snail possessed."
1033,"01:15:12,920","01:15:16,606","He is determined to
hold onto his lead."
1034,"01:15:27,720","01:15:28,767",No!
1035,"01:15:30,440","01:15:32,966",I will not lose to a snail!
1036,"01:15:34,440","01:15:36,124",Gagné is in the marbles!
1037,"01:15:38,240","01:15:39,605","Guy, what are you doing?"
1038,"01:15:45,120","01:15:46,121",Oh!
1039,"01:15:55,480","01:15:56,641",Ah...
1040,"01:16:01,280","01:16:02,327",Theo!
1041,"01:16:07,680","01:16:08,806",Turbo!
1042,"01:16:10,200","01:16:14,489","The track is backed up
all the way down the front straight."
1043,"01:16:14,640","01:16:17,689","It's complete
gridlock down there."
1044,"01:16:19,840","01:16:22,047","I can't see him.
I can't see him."
1045,"01:16:22,200","01:16:23,850","Guy, are you okay?"
1046,"01:16:28,520","01:16:30,045",Where am I?
1047,"01:16:37,840","01:16:38,959",There he is.
1048,"01:16:38,960","01:16:39,999",Theo.
1049,"01:16:40,000","01:16:41,684",Let's finish this.
1050,"01:17:00,200","01:17:01,611","Oh, no."
1051,"01:17:02,120","01:17:03,884","Oh...
Turbo."
1052,"01:17:17,960","01:17:22,409","No, no, no. Theo, what are you doing?
Don't give up."
1053,"01:17:23,680","01:17:24,886",Oh!
1054,"01:17:30,720","01:17:31,799",Oh!
1055,"01:17:34,800","01:17:37,087",Hey! Where are you going?
1056,"01:17:37,240","01:17:38,359","No, no!"
1057,"01:17:38,360","01:17:40,283","Get back here! No, wait!"
1058,"01:17:42,920","01:17:45,764",No! Little snail!
1059,"01:17:45,920","01:17:47,160",Theo!
1060,"01:17:47,760","01:17:49,091",Is that Chet?
1061,"01:17:54,160","01:17:59,007","Now, I'm gonna pretend I didn't
hear what I clearly just heard."
1062,"01:18:01,440","01:18:02,441",Ugh!
1063,"01:18:03,440","01:18:04,487",Salt!
1064,"01:18:10,080","01:18:12,447","Crows?
Are you kidding me?"
1065,"01:18:13,520","01:18:15,841","Long time no see, Chet!"
1066,"01:18:17,920","01:18:20,890","Hey!
Don't test me, crow."
1067,"01:18:22,600","01:18:23,601",White Shadow!
1068,"01:18:26,160","01:18:28,479","Nice moves back there, boo."
1069,"01:18:34,360","01:18:36,442",Is this really necessary?
1070,"01:18:36,600","01:18:39,119","No, man.
But it's fun."
1071,"01:18:39,120","01:18:40,360",Whoo!
1072,"01:18:43,680","01:18:44,727",Theo!
1073,"01:18:46,080","01:18:47,206",Theo!
1074,"01:18:56,200","01:18:57,319",Chet?
1075,"01:18:57,320","01:18:58,685",Finish this!
1076,"01:19:00,160","01:19:01,286",I can't.
1077,"01:19:01,440","01:19:03,647","Oh, yes, you can."
1078,"01:19:03,840","01:19:05,365","You're right, you know."
1079,"01:19:05,520","01:19:09,411","It is in you.
It's always been in you."
1080,"01:19:10,920","01:19:14,402","Now, I did not just face every
fear known to snail-kind"
1081,"01:19:14,600","01:19:18,127","to come down here and watch
you hide in your shell."
1082,"01:19:18,280","01:19:21,279","I'm sitting on a crow,
for crying out loud!"
1083,"01:19:22,560","01:19:24,608",Don't even think about it.
1084,"01:19:26,560","01:19:29,689","And my little brother
never gives up."
1085,"01:19:30,080","01:19:32,924","That's the best
thing about you."
1086,"01:19:33,680","01:19:37,162","So, you get out there
and you win this..."
1087,"01:19:38,120","01:19:39,360",Turbo.
1088,"01:19:58,160","01:19:59,525",He's still going.
1089,"01:20:09,200","01:20:11,168",Son of a gun.
1090,"01:20:25,240","01:20:26,605","Come on, come on!"
1091,"01:20:44,640","01:20:47,769","Unbelievable!
The race is back on!"
1092,"01:20:48,640","01:20:50,483","- Excuse me.
- Excuse me."
1093,"01:20:51,840","01:20:53,080",Little Amigo!
1094,"01:20:56,600","01:20:59,729","Hey, snail! He's gradually
gaining on you!"
1095,"01:21:24,640","01:21:26,051",Come on! Come on!
1096,"01:21:38,120","01:21:40,600",Turbo! Tuck and roll!
1097,"01:22:05,000","01:22:07,480",And Turbo wins it by a shell!
1098,"01:22:07,640","01:22:09,005",That's what I'm talking about!
1099,"01:22:11,640","01:22:13,563",Chet! Chet!
1100,"01:22:14,040","01:22:15,087",Turbo!
1101,"01:22:15,280","01:22:16,361",Chet!
1102,"01:22:16,720","01:22:18,768","We won, right?
We just won?"
1103,"01:22:18,960","01:22:20,724",We won.
1104,"01:22:20,920","01:22:26,370","Hey, everybody! My brother
won the Indy 5,000!"
1105,"01:22:26,520","01:22:29,967",Wow. That's so romantic.
1106,"01:22:30,920","01:22:33,571","Hey, Angelo. We did it!"
1107,"01:22:33,920","01:22:37,003",We did it. We did it!
1108,"01:22:37,240","01:22:40,369",Free tacos for everybody!
1109,"01:22:40,520","01:22:43,364","Snail power, baby!"
1110,"01:22:45,720","01:22:47,119",Um...
1111,"01:22:47,120","01:22:48,121",Mom.
1112,"01:22:48,560","01:22:51,245","Hey, Gagné! Why don't you pick
on someone your own size?"
1113,"01:22:51,400","01:22:53,209","You big bad boy!
Security!"
1114,"01:22:53,400","01:22:55,243","I step on you!
Do you like that?"
1115,"01:22:55,360","01:22:56,600","Sleeper hold!
All right."
1116,"01:22:56,760","01:22:59,411","Let go of me!
I'm just an old lady!"
1117,"01:23:01,880","01:23:03,245",Kim Ly Nail Salon!
1118,"01:23:09,080","01:23:11,242",That's our snail!
1119,"01:23:13,160","01:23:18,087","It's like I always said,
Little Amigo, you are amazing!"
1120,"01:23:20,400","01:23:21,526","Okay, wait."
1121,"01:23:21,720","01:23:23,722","Just keep your eyes closed
until I say so, okay?"
1122,"01:23:23,880","01:23:26,087","Tito, this is stupid."
1123,"01:23:26,240","01:23:27,321",Ta-da!
1124,"01:23:27,760","01:23:31,162","Hello, Angelo.
Let's get cooking."
1125,"01:23:31,360","01:23:32,519",Boom!
1126,"01:23:33,600","01:23:36,001","The stove talks, bro."
1127,"01:23:36,440","01:23:39,284","Uh-uh. Mmm-mmm. No, honey, soonest
available three months from now, 6:00 AM."
1128,"01:23:39,440","01:23:42,205","Brenda, that daisy really
brings out your foot!"
1129,"01:23:44,120","01:23:47,761","Hey, I'm not paying you guys
to sit around and look pretty."
1130,"01:23:48,600","01:23:50,284","Now, that's more like it."
1131,"01:23:50,480","01:23:51,759",Check it out.
1132,"01:23:51,760","01:23:52,959","Whoa.
This guy is good."
1133,"01:23:52,960","01:23:55,611","And last, but not
least, Sanitation. Mmm."
1134,"01:23:55,800","01:23:57,802","Nice choice, young man."
1135,"01:23:57,960","01:24:01,442","Come on, boys. It's time
to take out the trash."
1136,"01:24:05,680","01:24:08,286","Whoo-hoo! Take a
look at this place."
