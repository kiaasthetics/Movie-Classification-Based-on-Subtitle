please?"
4,"00:01:58,897","00:02:00,770",Say it.
5,"00:02:01,775","00:02:03,518","- Come on.
- Don't take a picture."
6,"00:02:03,610","00:02:07,738","Give us a smile. I'm sure there's a
pretty face under that frown somewhere."
7,"00:02:12,285","00:02:15,321","- Is that the best you got?
- Afraid so."
8,"00:02:15,413","00:02:17,986","- OK, get one of me.
- No, I'll take it at the top."
9,"00:02:18,082","00:02:20,573","Yeah, but I wanna get
some of this background in."
10,"00:02:20,668","00:02:22,043",Pass it over.
11,"00:02:24,672","00:02:27,589","Try and get some of that exposure in.
Show how high up we are."
12,"00:02:27,675","00:02:29,548",Is that a golden eagle?
13,"00:02:36,642","00:02:38,266",Beautiful.
14,"00:02:38,352","00:02:40,677","It's a golden eagle.
Buzzard. I don't know"
15,"00:02:40,771","00:02:43,096","Nah, it's way too big to be a buzzard."
16,"00:02:50,989","00:02:54,654","Alright, that's enough of the bird.
Point the camera at the money."
17,"00:02:55,660","00:02:57,155","Alison, come on."
18,"00:02:58,830","00:03:00,739","- Stop pouting.
- What?"
19,"00:03:02,167","00:03:03,958",It was a golden eagle.
20,"00:03:49,171","00:03:51,876","- Alison! Help me!
- Ed!"
21,"00:03:53,967","00:03:55,426","Jesus Christ, Alison!"
22,"00:03:56,094","00:03:58,253","- Shit!
- Rob, throw the rope."

- Alison!"
24,"00:03:59,514","00:04:03,808","- Ed!
- Alison, please! It's slipping!"
25,"00:04:03,894","00:04:05,554",It's gonna go!
26,"00:04:10,150","00:04:14,479","I can't... I can't...
I can't get up!"
27,"00:04:17,448","00:04:19,275","- Help me!
- Rob!"
28,"00:04:20,618","00:04:21,863",Rob!
29,"00:04:25,540","00:04:28,956","Ed, just breathe!"
30,"00:04:29,043","00:04:31,534","- It's not gonna hold!
- Ed! Ed!"
31,"00:04:31,629","00:04:34,250","Ed, you have to listen to me.
Just breathe."
32,"00:04:51,023","00:04:53,775","It's OK, but stop moving.
Keep it together."
33,"00:04:53,859","00:04:55,187","Alright, alright."
34,"00:04:55,277","00:04:57,519","Easy. OK, OK. Get your breath."
35,"00:04:57,613","00:05:00,483","Get your breath.
Jesus Christ, what happened, guys?"
36,"00:05:02,159","00:05:05,195","- Alison, are you alright?
- Don't ask. Yeah, I'm fine."
37,"00:05:05,287","00:05:08,987","Alright, mate, you're alright.
OK. Can you just pull yourself up?"
38,"00:05:09,082","00:05:11,122","- Thank God.
- Alison, you OK?"
39,"00:05:11,209","00:05:13,118","- I'm fine.
- Alright."
40,"00:05:13,211","00:05:15,998","It's OK, keep going.
Just get your breath."

80,"00:09:38,094","00:09:39,505",OK?
81,"00:09:40,513","00:09:42,091","Oh, right."
82,"00:09:45,977","00:09:49,013","Oh, honey, can you bring me
the cutlery, please, babe?"
83,"00:09:49,105","00:09:50,932",It's in the jug on the dresser.
84,"00:09:51,941","00:09:53,850",Smells like someone's died in here.
85,"00:09:53,943","00:09:57,277","Yeah, it is a little stinky.
I'll open a window, let some air in."

would have said."

could call up the landlord and complain."

- No."
91,"00:10:11,168","00:10:12,413",Great.
92,"00:10:14,713","00:10:18,379",And the window... is bust.

96,"00:11:02,677","00:11:07,006","You know, with a bit of luck, she'll be
tucked up and fast asleep by now."
97,"00:11:07,682","00:11:10,137",Your parents are such a pushover.
98,"00:11:10,226","00:11:13,310","She runs rings round them.
She's such a little monkey."
99,"00:11:15,523","00:11:16,851",I miss her.
100,"00:11:17,775","00:11:19,933","It's only been to days, Jen."
101,"00:11:20,945","00:11:22,107",Hmm.
102,"00:11:41,214","00:11:42,590",Bollocks.

106,"00:12:14,163","00:12:17,746","It's horrible. Girls, girls, stop.
Seriously, it's horrible."
107,"00:12:17,834","00:12:21,084","- Please, cards, go.
- OK. OK."
108,"00:12:21,170","00:12:22,545","But, erm..."
109,"00:12:22,630","00:12:25,880","Right, I need to know how much
one of these fellas is worth."
110,"00:12:25,966","00:12:27,626",Five matchsticks. Er!
111,"00:12:27,718","00:12:31,763","Er, no sex for you."
112,"00:12:31,847","00:12:36,308","- And, OK, a bottle top?
- Two pasta swirls to a top."
113,"00:12:37,186","00:12:41,480","Right. So then, ten matchsticks
makes one bottle top?"
114,"00:12:41,565","00:12:43,190",Yeah.
115,"00:12:43,275","00:12:46,975","Great. OK, thanks, guys.
It's a bit confusing, is all."
116,"00:12:47,070","00:12:48,980",It really isn't.
117,"00:12:49,072","00:12:51,694","- Be nice.
- What are you doing, Jen?"
118,"00:12:51,825","00:12:54,067","Ladies and gentlemen, I fold."
119,"00:12:55,370","00:12:58,620","- What have you got that's so special?
- Erm..."
120,"00:12:58,707","00:13:02,123","A pasta swirl and to tops
is what I'm gonna raise by."
121,"00:13:02,210","00:13:04,368","- I fold.
- Me, too."
122,"00:13:05,797","00:13:09,047",I'm gonna keep him honest. All in.
123,"00:13:11,010","00:13:13,336",The water's warm. Jump on in.
124,"00:13:14,514","00:13:16,388","Yeah, right. Erm, all in."
125,"00:13:21,896","00:13:23,972","- Three kings.
- Whoa."
126,"00:13:24,065","00:13:28,109","- Oh, damn, I've only got three tens.
- A-ha! Get in, yer dancer!"
127,"00:13:28,194","00:13:31,479","Come here, you lovely, lovely little..."
128,"00:13:31,572","00:13:33,446","Oh, look at his wee face."
129,"00:13:33,532","00:13:35,858","I've got a pair of queens as well,
if that helps."
130,"00:13:39,079","00:13:43,291","Oh, come on, sit down, Alex. Shock's
best absorbed with the knees bent."
131,"00:13:44,626","00:13:47,331",Full house. Let him take it.
132,"00:13:47,421","00:13:49,627",Don't spend it all in one pub.
133,"00:13:50,215","00:13:52,422","I can retire to the Bahamas
like Roger Moore."
134,"00:13:52,509","00:13:55,178","- You mean Sean Connery.
- I'm in the Roger Moore camp."
135,"00:13:55,262","00:13:58,927","There's nothing
wrong with a little bit of camp."
136,"00:13:59,016","00:14:00,925",That's a horrible impression.
137,"00:14:01,017","00:14:02,428","- It isn't.
- It is."
138,"00:14:02,519","00:14:03,550",It's not!
139,"00:14:08,233","00:14:10,225","Alex, what is this? Where's the Queen?"
140,"00:14:10,318","00:14:12,690","That's legal tender.
It's a Scottish tenner."
141,"00:14:12,779","00:14:16,195","It's worse than Monopoly money.
I can't buy anything with this."
142,"00:14:16,282","00:14:18,358",I've only got to words for you.
143,"00:14:18,451","00:14:21,867","- Yeah, do they involve sex and travel?
- Possibly."
144,"00:14:21,955","00:14:23,449","Well, don't say them."
145,"00:14:23,539","00:14:26,624","That's our cue to leave.
Goodnight, everybody."
146,"00:14:30,797","00:14:33,750","- Fuck off!
- Leave it. Goodnight!"
147,"00:14:34,383","00:14:35,961",Another round?
148,"00:14:36,761","00:14:39,548","Look, baby, I'm sorry.
I'm pissed. It was just banter."
149,"00:14:39,638","00:14:43,339","- Yeah. I know. But it's not very sexy.
- I'm not trying to be sexy."
150,"00:14:43,434","00:14:45,889",Why not? You're not on a promise.
151,"00:14:51,525","00:14:54,194","- Deal.
- Will do."
152,"00:14:57,948","00:15:00,569","Stick with me,
we'll climb that this time next year."
153,"00:15:00,659","00:15:03,232","The Eiger? Yeah, let's do it.
The north face."
154,"00:15:04,955","00:15:06,663",It killed 70 people.
155,"00:15:08,250","00:15:12,294","If you fall from the summit,
it'll take 30 seconds to hit the ground."
156,"00:15:12,796","00:15:15,916","- That's cheery.
- 30 seconds to recall your life,"
157,"00:15:16,007","00:15:18,463","say your goodbyes,
conscious the whole way down."
158,"00:15:18,551","00:15:20,710","Just enough time
to say the Lord's Prayer."
159,"00:15:20,804","00:15:25,181","- If you believe that's gonna save you.
- You're really gonna need something."
160,"00:15:29,729","00:15:33,145","- It's blowing a bastard out there.
- Yeah, I know."
161,"00:15:33,232","00:15:36,186","It's, er, supposed to clear up
through the night, though."
162,"00:15:36,277","00:15:38,519",But tomorrow is gonna be tricky.
163,"00:15:40,072","00:15:41,401",Drink?
164,"00:15:42,950","00:15:44,029",Fill her up.
165,"00:15:44,118","00:15:47,701","- No, you can't mix gin and whisky.
- It's called a gisky."
166,"00:15:47,788","00:15:49,164","- Is it?
- I just invented it."
167,"00:15:49,248","00:15:50,826","- Right.
- Gisky?"
168,"00:15:50,958","00:15:54,374","- Gisky. Would you like one?
- No, I'll pass."
169,"00:16:06,473","00:16:09,046","Alright, folks,
slight change of plan, I think."
170,"00:16:09,142","00:16:12,476","There are 40mph winds on that peak,
but they're gusting 60."
171,"00:16:12,562","00:16:17,023","It's supposed to die down tonight, so l
think we'll do the west face tomorrow"
172,"00:16:17,109","00:16:19,481",and just tackle the north ridge today.
173,"00:16:19,569","00:16:22,025","It's nothing more than a diff.
You know, V diff."
174,"00:16:22,113","00:16:26,111","So don't worry about rock shoes, helmets
or anything that'll weigh you down."
175,"00:16:26,201","00:16:28,359",We've got a lot of ground to cover.
176,"00:16:28,453","00:16:30,161",How's the exposure on the ridge?
177,"00:16:30,246","00:16:33,117","A bit thought provoking,
but keep hold of your harness."
178,"00:16:33,208","00:16:36,411","- I've got mine and we'll take the rope.
- OK, good."
179,"00:16:36,502","00:16:38,542","Got all your gear?
Don't leave anything."
180,"00:16:38,629","00:16:41,417","The only thing I left
is for a fully qualified plumber."
181,"00:16:41,507","00:16:42,836",Charming.
182,"00:16:45,094","00:16:47,419","- Good morning.
- Hey, how's the head?"
183,"00:16:47,513","00:16:50,716","Two cups of coffee and three aspirin,
I'm almost human again."
184,"00:16:52,685","00:16:53,764",OK?
185,"00:16:53,853","00:16:56,178","So I guess it's a no-go
on the west face, hmm?"
186,"00:16:56,272","00:16:59,937","No. This isn't Yosemite. The weather
up here does exactly what it wants."
187,"00:17:00,067","00:17:01,347",Yeah.
188,"00:17:03,988","00:17:06,823","- Got the lunch, Jen?
- Yeah, that's all under control."
189,"00:17:06,907","00:17:09,659","- What are we having?
- Sandwiches."
190,"00:17:09,743","00:17:14,286","Ah. The pinnacle of British cuisine.
No wonder the French hate us."
191,"00:17:14,373","00:17:17,243","- I make a pretty good sandwich.
- Well, what's in them?"
192,"00:17:17,334","00:17:19,789","Just wait and see.
The surprise is half the fun."
193,"00:17:19,878","00:17:21,871",Just as long as it's not fish.
194,"00:17:24,090","00:17:26,297","You should try one.
They're yummy."
195,"00:17:26,384","00:17:29,421","Smoked mackerel and egg?
I'd rather eat my own shit."
196,"00:17:29,512","00:17:31,671",No one's stopping you.
197,"00:17:31,765","00:17:35,632","You could always scrape out the mackerel
and just eat the bread."
198,"00:17:35,727","00:17:38,300","No, I can't do that. It's been tainted."
199,"00:17:38,396","00:17:39,974",You remind me of my daughter.
200,"00:17:40,106","00:17:42,478","She's clearly a lady
of impeccable taste."
201,"00:17:42,567","00:17:43,765",She's to.
202,"00:17:45,820","00:17:49,236","You're such a fussy eater.
It's so surprising at your age."
203,"00:17:49,323","00:17:51,945","Surprise is half the fun, right?"
204,"00:17:52,076","00:17:53,903",Thank fuck I brought chocolate.
205,"00:17:53,995","00:17:56,664","Five minutes and we're off.
Everybody OK with that?"
206,"00:17:56,747","00:17:58,407",Sounds good.
207,"00:18:06,257","00:18:07,419",It's beautiful.
208,"00:18:08,509","00:18:11,260","I know. Scenery like this
makes me wish I could paint."
209,"00:18:11,345","00:18:12,590",I'm gonna take a piss.
210,"00:18:12,680","00:18:15,764","- Yeah, good to know.
- Thought you might be interested."
211,"00:18:15,849","00:18:18,850","No, no, mate, you feel free
to keep us updated at all times."
212,"00:18:18,936","00:18:20,394",Will do.
213,"00:18:22,564","00:18:26,893","I've found a cracking spot.
I'm unbuttoning my fly."
214,"00:18:28,445","00:18:31,362","I'm getting it out.
Fucking hell, it weighs a ton."
215,"00:18:31,448","00:18:32,823","Shut up, wanker."
216,"00:18:56,055","00:18:58,842","Hey, guys! I heard something."
217,"00:18:58,933","00:19:00,890","Oh, yeah, what?"
218,"00:19:00,977","00:19:05,437","I dunno. Something.
Come here and check it out."
219,"00:19:05,523","00:19:07,811","Mate, you think I'm falling for that?"
220,"00:19:09,443","00:19:10,937",I'm serious.
221,"00:19:24,208","00:19:25,916",What is it?
222,"00:19:28,128","00:19:30,453","- What's going on up there?
- Hold on a sec!"
223,"00:19:31,757","00:19:33,465",Just listen.
224,"00:19:36,011","00:19:37,588",D'you hear that?
225,"00:19:41,099","00:19:42,890",I heard it.
226,"00:19:42,976","00:19:45,015","- What is it then?
- An animal?"
227,"00:19:45,979","00:19:47,770","- No way.
- Then what?"
228,"00:19:47,856","00:19:49,848","- Sounds to me like...
- Like what?"
229,"00:19:52,026","00:19:53,307",A person.
230,"00:19:55,238","00:19:58,155","- Guys, get over here.
- What is it?"
231,"00:19:58,241","00:20:00,032",Just get over here.
232,"00:20:14,507","00:20:17,377","- What is it?
- Shh. Listen."
233,"00:20:23,474","00:20:26,428","- I hear it.
- Yeah, me too."
234,"00:21:22,907","00:21:24,105",What is that?
235,"00:21:24,200","00:21:25,824",I've no idea.
236,"00:21:32,374","00:21:34,912","- Shit.
- What?"
237,"00:21:36,170","00:21:38,293",It's a breathing tube.
238,"00:21:39,715","00:21:41,292",There's someone down there.
239,"00:21:42,092","00:21:43,551","Just wait here, guys. Wait!"
240,"00:22:10,954","00:22:12,863",Hello?
241,"00:22:12,955","00:22:15,956",Jesus Christ!
242,"00:22:18,252","00:22:21,170","- Jesus Christ.
- What the hell is that?"
243,"00:22:21,255","00:22:22,963",Don't you mean who?
244,"00:22:26,844","00:22:28,089",What do we do?
245,"00:22:30,139","00:22:31,218",Ed.
246,"00:22:33,517","00:22:35,261","Wait a sec, guys."
247,"00:22:35,769","00:22:37,429",Hello?
248,"00:22:40,441","00:22:42,398","If you can hear us, say something!"
249,"00:22:44,611","00:22:45,726","Oh, Jesus."
250,"00:22:46,488","00:22:48,813","This was dug recently.
The earth's still soft."
251,"00:22:48,907","00:22:50,651",Why would somebody be down there?
252,"00:22:50,742","00:22:53,779",I told you I heard something.
253,"00:22:53,870","00:22:56,408","We're gonna help you.
Just sit tight for a moment."
254,"00:22:58,750","00:23:01,455","- What are you doing?
- We don't know what's down there."
255,"00:23:01,545","00:23:03,620","- It sounds like a child.
- I think so, too."
256,"00:23:03,713","00:23:05,670","We can think, but we don't fucking know."
257,"00:23:05,757","00:23:08,165","Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Guys, it's made of wood."
258,"00:23:09,636","00:23:13,087","- See if we can find the corners.
- This is insane. What are you doing?"
259,"00:23:13,181","00:23:15,802","Get down here! Help us.
Fucking kneel down and help."
260,"00:23:15,892","00:23:18,134",Come on!
261,"00:23:20,480","00:23:23,730","Right, we're gonna try
and lift it, OK? On three."
262,"00:23:23,816","00:23:26,521","One, to, three."
263,"00:23:30,072","00:23:31,650",Fuck.
264,"00:23:32,325","00:23:34,364","- Oh, my God.
- Jesus."
265,"00:23:38,122","00:23:40,114",Alright. Hello.
266,"00:23:41,083","00:23:44,618","Now don't be afraid. We're gonna get you
out of there. Alright?"
267,"00:23:44,712","00:23:46,040",Ed?
268,"00:23:47,172","00:23:49,081",Come on.
269,"00:23:49,174","00:23:51,926","No, no, no. Don't worry,
we're not gonna hurt you."
270,"00:23:52,010","00:23:55,095","OK, darling? We're not gonna hurt you.
Come on."
271,"00:23:57,015","00:23:59,767","For fuck's sake, you're scaring her!
Leave her alone."
272,"00:24:01,686","00:24:04,224","It's OK, sweetie."
273,"00:24:04,356","00:24:06,099",Alright. Alright.
274,"00:24:07,192","00:24:08,223",It's OK.
275,"00:24:09,277","00:24:12,611",It's alright. I'm not gonna hurt you.
276,"00:24:12,697","00:24:15,781","It's OK.
We're gonna get you out of here."
277,"00:24:16,951","00:24:18,611","Come on, sweetie."
278,"00:24:18,703","00:24:20,411",It's alright.
279,"00:24:21,456","00:24:24,029",It's OK. Good girl. It's OK.
280,"00:24:26,961","00:24:29,001",It's OK.
281,"00:24:29,881","00:24:32,798","- OK, honey. Help.
- OK."
282,"00:24:34,093","00:24:35,338",OK.
283,"00:24:35,428","00:24:38,927","Let's get you out of here.
Come up. Come up."
284,"00:24:39,015","00:24:40,722",Can you get me some water?
285,"00:24:45,271","00:24:48,437","Sit down.
It's alright, it's alright. OK."
286,"00:24:48,524","00:24:52,224",OK. OK. Here you go. There you go.
287,"00:24:53,654","00:24:57,402","Slowly. Drink slowly.
Slowly, slowly, slowly."
288,"00:24:57,491","00:25:00,694",Alright. Good girl.
289,"00:25:00,786","00:25:04,036",Oh. Alright. It's OK.
290,"00:25:04,122","00:25:06,993","It's alright, it's alright. It's OK."
291,"00:25:09,377","00:25:11,037","Sweetie, can you tell..."
292,"00:25:12,422","00:25:15,756",Can you tell me your name? Your name?
293,"00:25:16,676","00:25:19,713",I'm Jenny. Jenny.
294,"00:25:20,764","00:25:22,673",What's your name?
295,"00:25:22,766","00:25:24,924","- Anna.
- Anna."
296,"00:25:25,852","00:25:27,560","OK, Anna."
297,"00:25:28,855","00:25:32,224","Anna, where are you from?"
298,"00:25:36,446","00:25:38,652",OK. Alright.
299,"00:25:41,826","00:25:44,945","Anna, do you speak English?"
300,"00:25:45,037","00:25:50,707","Anna? English? Does anyone know
what language that is?"
301,"00:25:50,793","00:25:52,869","I dunno. Is it Russian, maybe?"
302,"00:25:52,962","00:25:56,128","- Might be Croatian.
- How do you know that?"
303,"00:25:56,215","00:25:59,880","Well, I had an ex-girlfriend from Zagreb
and she'd swear at me in Croat."
304,"00:25:59,968","00:26:03,005","- You're sure that's what it is?
- She used to swear at me a lot."
305,"00:26:03,097","00:26:06,679","- Can you understand what she's saying?
- No. The accent sounds familiar."
306,"00:26:06,767","00:26:08,843","Well, do you speak any Croat?"
307,"00:26:08,936","00:26:11,142","I could score an eighth,
ask for a threesome."
308,"00:26:11,229","00:26:13,021","- Ah, Jesus.
- Oh, for God's sake."
309,"00:26:13,106","00:26:15,562","- Dick.
- Sorry."
310,"00:26:15,650","00:26:19,980","- Why would someone do this?
- They didn't want her to die."
311,"00:26:21,740","00:26:24,278",Otherwise there wouldn't be an air pipe.
312,"00:26:24,367","00:26:28,116","I don't want to know who put her
down there or why they did it."
313,"00:26:28,204","00:26:30,742","I just want to get out of here
before they come back."
314,"00:26:30,832","00:26:33,323","Listen, listen.
She's our responsibility now."
315,"00:26:33,459","00:26:35,618","We've got to get help.
We've got to get her"
316,"00:26:36,212","00:26:37,956",off these mountains soon.
317,"00:26:39,632","00:26:45,670","OK. Right, we're here, 12 miles
south-southwest of Alltnacaillich."
318,"00:26:45,763","00:26:48,515","The nearest village is Annan Mor, so..."
319,"00:26:48,599","00:26:50,343",Yeah.
320,"00:26:50,434","00:26:54,302","We could go east along the Scimitar
Ridge until we get to the river,"
321,"00:26:54,397","00:26:57,765","then double back to the village.
It's about 15, 20 miles all in."
322,"00:26:57,858","00:27:01,061","I found this in the hole.
She must've been down there for days."
323,"00:27:01,153","00:27:04,189","- Did she have any food?
- Didn't look like it."
324,"00:27:04,281","00:27:07,899","She must have been starving
down there all by herself in the dark."
325,"00:27:07,993","00:27:10,531","Let's not kill her with
a smoked mackerel sandwich."
326,"00:27:10,621","00:27:12,909",Can we use your phone? Phone for help?
327,"00:27:12,998","00:27:14,576","What, in these mountains?"
328,"00:27:14,666","00:27:18,035","Won't get anything approaching
a signal till you get near the A9."
329,"00:27:18,128","00:27:19,622",That's about 30 miles away.
330,"00:27:19,713","00:27:22,204",You said it was 15 miles to the village.
331,"00:27:23,759","00:27:27,174","There is a faster route.
We're only to miles from Devil's Drop."
332,"00:27:27,262","00:27:30,631","- What's Devil's Drop?
- The only way to breach the ridge."
333,"00:27:30,724","00:27:33,215","It's a sheer cliff face
500 foot straight down,"
334,"00:27:33,309","00:27:37,521","but from there, it is only
a four-mile hike to Annan Mor."
335,"00:27:38,231","00:27:40,270",How do we get a child down Devil's Drop?
336,"00:27:41,234","00:27:44,567","We don't. Two of us abseil down
and run to the village for help,"
337,"00:27:44,654","00:27:48,189","alert the police and get the Highland
Rescue to pick up the rest of you."
338,"00:27:48,282","00:27:51,651","- Who are you gonna take with you?
- Alison."
339,"00:27:51,744","00:27:54,531","Sorry, Ed, no arguments, mate.
I need the best."
340,"00:27:54,622","00:27:58,833","It's a massive face, Rob.
I mean, we don't have enough rope."
341,"00:27:58,918","00:28:01,124","I've got 20 metres of seven mil
if that helps."
342,"00:28:01,212","00:28:02,955","No, no, you keep that with you."
343,"00:28:03,047","00:28:06,416","There's some rough terrain.
You might need it. We'll manage."
344,"00:28:06,550","00:28:09,966","- We'll multi pitch it. It'll be fine.
- Do you want us to wait here?"
345,"00:28:10,054","00:28:12,260",No. There's no way we're staying here.
346,"00:28:12,348","00:28:17,223","Follow the route on the map. I'll make
sure they get the helicopter out to you."
347,"00:28:17,311","00:28:20,347","As long as you stick to that route,
they'll find you easily."
348,"00:29:00,061","00:29:03,097","- Yeah, that's it. There it is. See?
- Where?"
349,"00:29:03,189","00:29:05,940","That's the Haston Step.
It's the first belay point."
350,"00:29:16,660","00:29:19,946","- You wanna go first?
- Yeah."
351,"00:30:14,967","00:30:16,426",Rob?
352,"00:30:18,095","00:30:20,800","Fuck! Rob, there's no more rope."
353,"00:30:20,890","00:30:23,262",Can you make it?
354,"00:30:29,690","00:30:32,810","- Easy.
- Shit. Shit!"
355,"00:30:34,069","00:30:35,812",Easy.
356,"00:31:14,442","00:31:18,439",Alison! How is it?
357,"00:31:18,529","00:31:20,107","Fucking scary, Rob."
358,"00:31:21,574","00:31:25,025","There's no footholds for five feet.
You be careful, OK?"
359,"00:32:00,653","00:32:02,064",Rob!
360,"00:32:06,993","00:32:10,693","Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Oh, my God!"
361,"00:32:10,788","00:32:14,288","Oh, my God! Oh, my God!"
362,"00:32:28,723","00:32:32,388","Look, why don't we carry her?
Me and Ed could take it in turns."
363,"00:32:32,476","00:32:34,136","- Makes sense.
- OK."
364,"00:32:35,563","00:32:37,140","- Come on.
- Here you go."
365,"00:32:37,231","00:32:39,105",Be gentle.
366,"00:32:39,191","00:32:40,519",Anna!
367,"00:32:43,112","00:32:44,357","- Come on.
- Jesus Christ!"
368,"00:32:44,446","00:32:45,821","- Put her down.
- Whoa."
369,"00:32:48,116","00:32:51,201","Right, so what do we do now?
You won't be able to carry her."
370,"00:32:51,703","00:32:56,080","- I can try.
- You'll collapse after 100 yards."
371,"00:32:57,125","00:32:58,785",Then we'll go at Anna's pace.
372,"00:32:58,877","00:33:01,664","- That's pretty fucking slow.
- Watch your language."
373,"00:33:01,755","00:33:03,997","- She can't understand.
- Hardly the point."
374,"00:33:04,090","00:33:07,293","- For fuck's sake.
- We've gotta keep moving. Come on."
375,"00:33:07,385","00:33:10,007","Do you have any idea
what she's been through?"
376,"00:33:10,096","00:33:13,928","I get it, OK?
Can we just go now? Please?"
377,"00:33:15,393","00:33:16,673","- Come on.
- OK."
378,"00:33:16,769","00:33:19,011","Come on, sweetie. We have to go."
379,"00:34:18,037","00:34:19,235",Fuck!
380,"00:34:21,165","00:34:22,328",Jesus!
381,"00:34:24,377","00:34:26,334",Fuck. Fuck it. Fuck!
382,"00:34:37,348","00:34:40,053",Fuck! Fuck! Fuck!
383,"00:36:40,301","00:36:41,712",Hey!
384,"00:36:44,222","00:36:45,301",Hey!
385,"00:36:48,351","00:36:49,975",Help!
386,"00:36:58,861","00:37:00,236",Fuck you!
387,"00:37:01,989","00:37:03,732",Fuck you.
388,"00:38:22,568","00:38:24,110",It's been cut!
389,"00:38:39,084","00:38:41,705","I think it's about a mile away
to the river."
390,"00:38:51,262","00:38:52,756",There they are.
391,"00:38:57,560","00:39:00,763","- I see them.
- How far?"
392,"00:39:01,689","00:39:05,058","400 yards, maybe more."
393,"00:39:05,151","00:39:09,100","- You got a shot?
- At this range?"
394,"00:39:10,614","00:39:13,568","Don't waste it.
Let's get over that next ridge."
395,"00:39:42,187","00:39:43,598",There they are.
396,"00:39:50,737","00:39:54,022","Chuck us over your hip flask
and give me a nip."
397,"00:40:02,373","00:40:04,662",What is this filthy shit?
398,"00:40:04,751","00:40:07,954","- It's spirit drink.
- Spirit drink?"
399,"00:40:08,045","00:40:12,173","I got it at the petrol garage. It's so
cheap they can't even call it vodka."
400,"00:40:12,258","00:40:15,009","- It's pish.
- It gets the job done."
401,"00:40:24,144","00:40:25,425",Hello there.
402,"00:40:26,313","00:40:27,724",Good afternoon.
403,"00:40:30,234","00:40:32,060",What are you fellas doing out here?
404,"00:40:33,028","00:40:34,606",Hiking.
405,"00:40:37,199","00:40:39,488",Long way from civilisation.
406,"00:40:39,576","00:40:41,450",That's the idea.
407,"00:40:41,536","00:40:42,947",You stalking?
408,"00:40:43,997","00:40:45,195",Yeah.
409,"00:40:46,041","00:40:48,876","You know the hunting season's been over
for three months?"
410,"00:40:49,002","00:40:50,282",What do you care?
411,"00:40:51,588","00:40:55,585","It's just if you're hunting out of
season, we're gonna have to report you."
412,"00:40:56,634","00:40:58,508",That's a pretty big gun.
413,"00:40:58,595","00:41:02,129","It's a 308. It'll put a dent
in just about anything."
414,"00:41:03,766","00:41:05,889","You think the deer
have a fighting chance?"
415,"00:41:06,644","00:41:09,265","I think everything's
got a fighting chance."
416,"00:41:11,315","00:41:12,810",Do you?
417,"00:41:12,900","00:41:15,522","You boys a pair of animal rights
wankers, are you?"
418,"00:41:15,611","00:41:17,189",You're a long way from anywhere.
419,"00:41:17,280","00:41:20,731","Me and him don't take kindly to
left-wing bastards coming out here..."
420,"00:41:24,870","00:41:29,117","Please. Oh, please, don't do it.
I'll stop hunting."
421,"00:41:29,708","00:41:32,116","But everything's got a fighting chance,
right?"
422,"00:41:34,797","00:41:36,505",He said that.
423,"00:41:37,674","00:41:39,714",Please. Please don't kill me.
424,"00:41:39,802","00:41:41,461",Take a step back.
425,"00:41:41,553","00:41:44,127","- Oh, God, please. Please, no.
- Hey."
426,"00:41:45,307","00:41:46,422",Do it.
427,"00:41:47,726","00:41:49,849","- Jesus Christ.
- Keep going."
428,"00:41:49,936","00:41:51,561","Oh, God, no."
429,"00:41:51,646","00:41:53,556",That's it.
430,"00:41:53,648","00:41:55,724","- And another.
- Please. Oh, fuck."
431,"00:41:55,817","00:41:58,853","- Don't stop.
- Oh, dear God!"
432,"00:42:09,706","00:42:11,081",And that's that.
433,"00:42:25,596","00:42:26,711",You still with me?
434,"00:42:29,892","00:42:31,386",Whatever it takes.
435,"00:42:31,977","00:42:34,385","I think it might take a bit more
than we thought."
436,"00:42:37,858","00:42:40,563",Aye. It might.
437,"00:42:53,332","00:42:55,371",How did they sound?
438,"00:42:55,459","00:42:59,243","Practised. In control. Like they knew
exactly what they were doing."
439,"00:42:59,337","00:43:01,496",That's usually a good sign.
440,"00:43:01,590","00:43:02,918",Follow the road.
441,"00:43:03,008","00:43:07,301","- Remind me of the name of this place.
- Annan Mor. Southwest of lnverness."
442,"00:43:07,387","00:43:09,261",Still a good 80 miles.
443,"00:43:31,994","00:43:33,239",Hey!
444,"00:43:35,623","00:43:37,034",Hey!
445,"00:43:37,166","00:43:40,914",Look. Look. Look. Alison.
446,"00:43:42,922","00:43:45,247",The rope was cut.
447,"00:43:45,341","00:43:49,919","The rope was cut.
Someone cut the rope."
448,"00:43:50,012","00:43:52,384","- Can you hear her?
- She's smashed her legs up."
449,"00:43:52,473","00:43:55,557","You can see it in her leg and her arms.
Something's wrong, Jen."
450,"00:43:56,810","00:43:58,968","It's alright, sweetheart,
don't be scared."
451,"00:43:59,062","00:44:00,343",Don't be scared. It's OK.
452,"00:44:00,439","00:44:05,147",Someone cut the rope. Rob was murdered.
453,"00:44:05,235","00:44:07,607","- Can you hear what she's saying?
- Look at her leg."
454,"00:44:07,696","00:44:10,862","We can't understand
a word you're saying."
455,"00:44:14,202","00:44:17,488","I need to get across to you
further down the river."
456,"00:44:17,580","00:44:22,871","Alison! Alison,
you're gonna have to shout louder."
457,"00:44:22,961","00:44:26,211","We need to find a crossing
further downstream."
458,"00:44:29,217","00:44:33,084","She wants us to go down the river.
OK, OK. Where's Rob?"
459,"00:44:33,221","00:44:34,798","Rob, where is he?"
460,"00:44:34,889","00:44:36,513",Where is he?
461,"00:44:46,942","00:44:48,223",Fuck!
462,"00:44:54,283","00:44:56,441","What are we gonna do, Jen?"
463,"00:44:59,705","00:45:01,496",What do we do?
464,"00:45:06,336","00:45:07,712",No.
465,"00:45:19,808","00:45:22,477","- Jen! Jenny!
- Alex!"
466,"00:45:22,560","00:45:25,976",Jenny! Jenny!
467,"00:45:26,064","00:45:27,392","Alex, Alex, Alex, no!"
468,"00:45:27,482","00:45:29,771",Jenny! Jenny! Jenny!
469,"00:45:29,859","00:45:32,777","- Listen to me. Alex!
- Jenny, give me your hand."
470,"00:45:36,574","00:45:37,902","Alex, she's gone!"
471,"00:45:39,577","00:45:42,150","We can't get her from here.
We've gotta go down there."
472,"00:45:53,674","00:45:55,999","Ed, Ed, I can see her."
473,"00:45:57,303","00:46:01,051","Hold on to the rocks, Jen.
Hold on to the rocks."
474,"00:46:07,104","00:46:09,310","- Hold on to the rocks!
- Alex, listen to me."
475,"00:46:09,398","00:46:12,102","You have to follow me.
I know what I'm doing. Follow me."
476,"00:46:48,769","00:46:49,849",Alison!
477,"00:46:51,647","00:46:52,976",Alison!
478,"00:46:54,942","00:46:56,769","Come on, come on!"
479,"00:47:33,938","00:47:35,516",Anna!
480,"00:47:38,443","00:47:39,688",Anna!
481,"00:47:45,825","00:47:47,485",Anna!
482,"00:48:29,910","00:48:31,155",No. Gone.
483,"00:48:36,124","00:48:37,239",There!
484,"00:48:54,309","00:48:55,968",Anna!
485,"00:48:56,853","00:49:00,019",Anna! Anna!
486,"00:49:00,106","00:49:02,063",Anna!
487,"00:50:04,627","00:50:06,952","Come on, Anna."
488,"00:50:07,046","00:50:09,252","Come on, Anna. Come on."
489,"00:50:19,266","00:50:21,093",OK. Anna.
490,"00:50:31,195","00:50:33,104","It's OK, Anna."
491,"00:51:22,912","00:51:26,162",Anna! Anna!
492,"00:51:56,862","00:51:59,103",Alex. Alex.
493,"00:52:02,659","00:52:04,319",Are you alright?
494,"00:52:05,328","00:52:06,491",Look at me.
495,"00:52:09,374","00:52:13,371","- We have to find the others, OK?
- Right."
496,"00:52:13,461","00:52:15,121",Ed!
497,"00:52:16,422","00:52:17,453",Anna?
498,"00:52:21,010","00:52:22,967",Ed!
499,"00:53:10,016","00:53:12,424",Here!
500,"00:53:55,185","00:53:56,977",Ed.
501,"00:53:57,062","00:53:58,521",Anna.
502,"00:53:58,605","00:54:00,016",Ed.
503,"00:54:02,526","00:54:06,060",Anna. Thank God. Shh. Shh.
504,"00:54:10,492","00:54:11,606",What happened?
505,"00:54:11,701","00:54:15,236","I fell. It might be broken,
I don't know."
506,"00:54:22,337","00:54:24,163",They're coming.
507,"00:54:24,255","00:54:25,666","- How many?
- Two."
508,"00:54:25,757","00:54:27,381",Shit.
509,"00:54:30,720","00:54:33,293","- OK, let's go.
- No. He can't run."
510,"00:54:33,389","00:54:36,343","- I can try.
- That won't be enough."
511,"00:54:38,853","00:54:43,811","Look, listen. You, me, Ed,
we don't mean a thing to these people."
512,"00:54:43,899","00:54:47,564","She's the only one with any value.
She's what they want."
513,"00:54:56,453","00:54:57,484",That's her!
514,"00:55:01,166","00:55:03,704","- What about the others?
- Follow the money!"
515,"00:57:03,661","00:57:06,496","Are you gonna finish him
or do you want me to do it?"
516,"00:57:06,580","00:57:10,625","After what he's just put us through?
No, I wanna watch him breathe out."
517,"00:57:20,677","00:57:22,421",You feel that?
518,"00:57:24,431","00:57:26,803",That's the price of your nobility.
519,"00:57:29,686","00:57:31,595","Hurts, doesn't it?"
520,"00:57:43,825","00:57:46,779","In 200 metres, bear left."
521,"00:57:49,247","00:57:52,117","In 150 metres, bear left."
522,"00:57:52,542","00:57:53,952",In one...
523,"00:57:57,547","00:57:58,791",Well done.
524,"00:58:00,424","00:58:04,671","- How will we know where to go?
- Maybe we should just bear left."
525,"00:58:04,762","00:58:08,380","People have been finding their way
for years without fucking computers."
526,"00:58:08,474","00:58:11,594","There is no equal to a map
and a bit of nous."
527,"00:58:11,685","00:58:14,176","- How are we doing back there?
- I'm almost done."
528,"00:58:14,271","00:58:16,430",Just gotta check the frequency.
529,"00:58:16,899","00:58:20,647","If this briefcase moves so much
as an inch, we're gonna know about it."
530,"00:58:20,736","00:58:22,527","Well, that's reassuring."
531,"00:58:22,613","00:58:26,147","I may as well wipe my arse on that money
if we can't find the girl."
532,"00:58:57,647","00:58:58,975",OK.
533,"00:59:00,483","00:59:02,475","OK, Anna, I'm gonna need you
to lean back."
534,"00:59:03,819","00:59:05,195",Just take a step.
535,"00:59:05,279","00:59:07,486","It's OK, sweetheart.
Just, just lean back."
536,"00:59:10,785","00:59:14,319","You gotta trust me. It's OK, I promise.
Just take a step back and lean..."
537,"00:59:14,413","00:59:16,240","No, Alison. Alison."
538,"00:59:16,332","00:59:19,701","Jesus Christ, Anna!
There's no other way down!"
539,"00:59:21,754","00:59:23,129",OK.
540,"00:59:26,341","00:59:29,461",Look at me. Look at me. I've got you.
541,"00:59:30,846","00:59:32,838","You have to trust me, sweetheart."
542,"00:59:33,515","00:59:34,760",OK?
543,"00:59:34,850","00:59:38,349",Put your shoulders back. Lean back.
544,"00:59:38,437","00:59:40,394",There you go.
545,"00:59:40,480","00:59:43,600",Good girl. Good girl.
546,"00:59:50,281","00:59:53,282","It's OK, Anna. Keep coming."
547,"00:59:53,368","00:59:55,610","Oops. Keep coming. Steady, steady."
548,"01:00:02,460","01:00:06,327",OK. Alright. I've got you. I've got you.
549,"01:00:32,990","01:00:36,904","- This is no time for a rest. Let's go.
- Just give me a moment, please."
550,"01:00:36,994","01:00:39,449","If Alex made it,
he'd have called the police."
551,"01:00:41,707","01:00:43,580",They could already be looking for us.
552,"01:00:44,459","01:00:46,037","You heard the shots, Alison."
553,"01:00:47,462","01:00:49,040",He's dead.
554,"01:00:53,343","01:00:54,967",Let's go. Get up.
555,"01:00:55,512","01:00:56,970",Get up!
556,"01:00:58,473","01:00:59,967",Leave me here.
557,"01:01:01,935","01:01:04,307","I'm slowing you down as it is.
Just leave me here."
558,"01:01:04,395","01:01:06,471","- You don't want that.
- I've broken my leg."
559,"01:01:06,564","01:01:09,731","- What more do you want?
- It's not broken. You're walking on it."
560,"01:01:13,196","01:01:16,980","- What if we've done the wrong thing?
- What do you mean?"
561,"01:01:21,829","01:01:24,402",Maybe we should have left her there.
562,"01:01:24,498","01:01:27,914","- What?
- Hear me out. Please."
563,"01:01:28,002","01:01:29,793",Please listen to me.
564,"01:01:30,796","01:01:32,171",Why was she even there?
565,"01:01:32,256","01:01:35,126","Why in Scotland?
She clearly sounds Eastern European."
566,"01:01:35,217","01:01:37,375","I don't know, Ed.
I don't know. You tell me."
567,"01:01:37,469","01:01:40,554","Maybe she was kidnapped.
She's still in her school uniform."
568,"01:01:40,639","01:01:43,426","She was probably snatched
right outside the school."
569,"01:01:43,517","01:01:46,434","Kidnappers usually demand a ransom,
don't they?"
570,"01:01:47,688","01:01:52,515","In which case there's probably
another party involved, police."
571,"01:01:53,318","01:01:56,817","And what if we've come along
and trampled on a delicate situation?"
572,"01:01:57,531","01:02:00,615","We might have blown her chances
of a safe handover."
573,"01:02:01,451","01:02:02,993",What if we've killed her?
574,"01:02:03,620","01:02:05,743",What if this is all our fault?
575,"01:02:05,830","01:02:07,823","- Look at her.
- I'm just..."
576,"01:02:07,916","01:02:09,493",Just fucking look at her.
577,"01:02:10,752","01:02:14,666","Could you leave her in the ground?
Could you?"
578,"01:02:16,549","01:02:17,580",No.
579,"01:02:19,260","01:02:20,671",Then there's your answer.
580,"01:02:22,680","01:02:25,966","Did her family do this to her?
Was she kidnapped? I don't know."
581,"01:02:26,058","01:02:28,929","And you don't know.
But if we've done the wrong thing,"
582,"01:02:29,020","01:02:32,768","then I'll fucking live with it.
Now get up! Find a way."
583,"01:02:36,235","01:02:38,192",They'll be heading up to Annan Mor.
584,"01:02:38,862","01:02:42,196","And here we are,
empty fucking handed."
585,"01:02:43,534","01:02:46,784","Look, you remember that Japanese kid
last winter? Remember him?"
586,"01:02:46,870","01:02:49,159","Rats crawled through the pipe,
ate him alive."
587,"01:02:49,248","01:02:51,786","- What about him?
- Parents still paid up."
588,"01:02:51,875","01:02:56,003","Bluffed our way out of that. Maybe
we can't bluff our way out of this."
589,"01:02:57,255","01:03:00,790",You do it your way. I'll try mine.
590,"01:03:12,270","01:03:14,678",You're probably wondering
591,"01:03:14,772","01:03:16,682","why your daughter
has not come home."
592,"01:03:16,774","01:03:20,226","We have dug a hole,
four feet by three. She's down there."
593,"01:03:20,361","01:03:24,655","She has enough water for a week,
maybe less. She has no food."
594,"01:03:24,741","01:03:26,698",There's no chance you can find her.
595,"01:03:26,784","01:03:30,782","Her location is as remote
as it is inaccessible."
596,"01:03:30,872","01:03:32,116",You're being watched.
597,"01:03:32,206","01:03:35,409","If you try and contact the police,
we will leave her where she is."
598,"01:03:35,501","01:03:39,166",She will die there. In the dark. Alone.
599,"01:03:39,255","01:03:41,413",You will never find her body.
600,"01:03:41,507","01:03:44,508",We want money. Six million euros.
601,"01:03:44,593","01:03:49,421","Clean, non-sequential. No marked money,
transponders or dye packs."
602,"01:03:49,515","01:03:52,469","More instructions
regarding the hand-off will follow."
603,"01:03:52,559","01:03:54,219",Stay by the phone.
604,"01:03:55,938","01:03:57,017",Who taped the call?
605,"01:03:57,773","01:04:02,850","My employer records everything.
That includes his ex-wife's telephone."
606,"01:04:03,653","01:04:06,275","Well, these bastards aren't stupid,
are they?"
607,"01:04:06,406","01:04:10,320","If you call the police and they get
nicked, they just gotta deny everything."
608,"01:04:10,452","01:04:13,618","Since the girl's in the ground,
there's no connection to us."
609,"01:04:13,705","01:04:15,116",She dies about the same time
610,"01:04:15,206","01:04:17,828","that the police release them
due to lack of evidence."
611,"01:04:17,917","01:04:20,076","There's no body,
no murder investigation."
612,"01:04:20,170","01:04:22,625","That is about as sweet a hustle
as I've ever seen."
613,"01:04:22,714","01:04:26,083","The only time they expose themselves
is at the hand-off."
614,"01:04:27,594","01:04:29,919",Do you know where the pub is?
615,"01:04:30,013","01:04:32,848",It's not a big village. I'll find it.
616,"01:04:32,932","01:04:35,423","When you get there,
you grab a table by the window."
617,"01:04:35,518","01:04:38,270","If you can't find one,
you stand by the bar and you wait."
618,"01:04:38,354","01:04:40,679","No one will approach you
until you sit down."
619,"01:04:40,773","01:04:42,813",Don't try and guess who it's gonna be.
620,"01:04:42,900","01:04:45,569","Think about nothing except that table.
Understand?"
621,"01:04:45,653","01:04:46,767",Yeah.
622,"01:04:48,656","01:04:52,072","Don't look too confident.
Don't look too nervous either."
623,"01:04:52,159","01:04:56,026","You find a middle ground. You let 'em
know that it's strictly business."
624,"01:04:56,121","01:04:59,573","If they've got the girl,
they're gonna get paid."
625,"01:04:59,666","01:05:02,537","- Let's hope they bring her.
- They will. They have to."
626,"01:05:02,628","01:05:06,577","They'll keep her out of sight until they
see the money. That's where you come in."
627,"01:05:06,673","01:05:09,959","You demand to see her
before you hand it over."
628,"01:05:10,052","01:05:12,803","If they can get away
without making a trade, they will."
629,"01:05:12,888","01:05:16,755","Leaving a body behind is a lot easier
than making a full exchange."
630,"01:05:16,850","01:05:21,808","No one makes a move until we see
the girl. If I return without her..."
631,"01:05:25,900","01:05:27,692",Have you met her father?
632,"01:05:27,777","01:05:30,529",I've heard of him by reputation.
633,"01:05:36,411","01:05:39,411","- So you know that...
- He's got a pretty bad reputation."
634,"01:05:40,331","01:05:45,372","Have a jolly up in Kosovo, did he?
Little bit of an ethnic spring clean?"
635,"01:05:46,295","01:05:49,794","Same as the rest of the Serbian wankers
that we slotted back in '99."
636,"01:05:49,882","01:05:54,295","So trust me, yes,
I know who I'm dealing with."
637,"01:05:54,386","01:05:56,260",Really?
638,"01:05:56,347","01:05:59,881","When we make our move,
it's gonna be quick and loud."
639,"01:05:59,975","01:06:03,889","Throw yourself on the floor cos he's
gonna go like fucking Christian Bale."
640,"01:06:03,979","01:06:06,470",Stay down till me or him picks you up.
641,"01:06:06,565","01:06:10,265","All I care about is the girl.
We get her safe and quick."
642,"01:06:10,360","01:06:11,985",Then we worry about her captors.
643,"01:06:12,070","01:06:14,941","Your employers,
they wanna keep 'em alive?"
644,"01:06:15,032","01:06:17,605","- If possible.
- We'll see."
645,"01:06:20,078","01:06:23,447","No shotguns.
I can't risk you hitting the girl."
646,"01:06:23,582","01:06:25,870","It's loaded with solid shot, no spread."
647,"01:06:27,669","01:06:31,120","We're English, Darko.
We leave friendly fire to the Yanks."
648,"01:06:36,678","01:06:38,302",Hey!
649,"01:06:39,889","01:06:42,012",Hey. Hey.
650,"01:07:54,128","01:07:56,417","Hi. We, erm... We need to..."
651,"01:07:56,506","01:07:59,079","We need to report a kidnapping
and three murders."
652,"01:08:38,964","01:08:41,289","We'll get you up to lnverness
as quick as we can."
653,"01:08:41,383","01:08:44,383","Constable Stewart will drive you.
He shouldn't be a minute."
654,"01:08:44,469","01:08:47,470","They can take your statements,
give you medical attention."
655,"01:08:47,555","01:08:51,553","I'll be just past the kitchen.
So don't worry, I'm not going anywhere."
656,"01:08:51,643","01:08:54,098","- You said kitchen.
- Aye."
657,"01:08:54,187","01:08:56,310",She could do with something to eat.
658,"01:09:13,956","01:09:16,743","- I can't get through to lnverness.
- Why not?"
659,"01:09:16,834","01:09:19,289","It's a big country.
It all needs policing."
660,"01:09:19,378","01:09:21,584",So call another station.
661,"01:09:21,714","01:09:26,043","I've left a message. I'm sure the desk
sergeant will call back in a minute."
662,"01:09:27,052","01:09:31,299","Chocolate cake. My wife's recipe.
I think you might just love it."
663,"01:09:50,784","01:09:52,029",You Darko?
664,"01:09:53,620","01:09:55,197",Yes.
665,"01:09:56,372","01:09:58,246",You got something for me?
666,"01:09:59,209","01:10:02,044","- That depends.
- Does it?"
667,"01:10:03,379","01:10:06,463","I've got the more valuable
merchandise. What have you got?"
668,"01:10:07,800","01:10:08,998",Money?
669,"01:10:12,096","01:10:15,595","There'll always be money in the world,
mate. Plenty of that to go round."
670,"01:10:15,683","01:10:19,633",But this little girl? Unique.
671,"01:10:20,980","01:10:22,640",One of a kind.
672,"01:10:24,024","01:10:27,856","- What are you trying to say?
- That we do things my way."
673,"01:10:32,074","01:10:34,232",You brought the money?
674,"01:10:36,495","01:10:37,657",Yeah.
675,"01:10:39,873","01:10:42,578",Then this is how we're gonna do it.
676,"01:10:42,668","01:10:45,704","I leave here now with the case
and check it with my associates."
677,"01:10:45,837","01:10:47,996","All being well and good,"
678,"01:10:48,089","01:10:52,882","you'll receive a call telling you
where you can find the girl."
679,"01:10:57,265","01:10:58,593",No.
680,"01:11:02,812","01:11:06,146","- Then I'm gonna leave.
- Go?"
681,"01:11:06,232","01:11:08,901",You sure?
682,"01:11:08,985","01:11:12,401","You're not gonna walk out of here
empty handed"
683,"01:11:12,488","01:11:14,813",without listening to what I have to say.
684,"01:11:14,907","01:11:20,032","- I wouldn't fucking bet on that, mate.
- I stake six million euros on it."
685,"01:11:23,624","01:11:25,664",That's what you've got in the case?
686,"01:11:25,751","01:11:30,496","We both know only fools fill cases
with counterfeit money,"
687,"01:11:30,589","01:11:36,176","fools who don't care to see
their children again. I'm no fool."
688,"01:11:37,638","01:11:41,967","I'm glad to hear it. Because the same
thing happened to me a few years back."
689,"01:11:44,019","01:11:46,890","I took a boy from his family
in Marseilles."
690,"01:11:48,940","01:11:51,692","Well, it was a long negotiation
to say the least."
691,"01:11:51,777","01:11:54,481",Went on for so long I made a mistake.
692,"01:11:58,783","01:12:00,242",I bonded with the boy.
693,"01:12:01,786","01:12:03,530",We became close.
694,"01:12:07,667","01:12:11,332","He kept saying he wanted to come
and visit me when it was all over."
695,"01:12:18,344","01:12:22,258","His parents decided to hand off
a bag full of shredded newspaper."
696,"01:12:22,348","01:12:25,515","Police thought they were gonna catch us
during the drop-off."
697,"01:12:27,395","01:12:28,972","Oh, no."
698,"01:12:33,401","01:12:36,485","I took the boy out in the garden
to play a game of football."
699,"01:12:36,570","01:12:38,942",I remember because he went in goal.
700,"01:12:40,241","01:12:43,941","When he bent down to pick up the ball,
I shot him in the back of the head."
701,"01:12:45,287","01:12:47,778",Quick. Painless.
702,"01:12:49,666","01:12:51,493",Least I could do.
703,"01:12:53,045","01:12:56,248","I buried him somewhere
in the southwest of France."
704,"01:12:59,259","01:13:02,130","Parents are still looking for him,
last I heard."
705,"01:13:04,556","01:13:05,884",Well done.
706,"01:13:08,059","01:13:11,724","Like I said, I'm no fool."
707,"01:13:13,356","01:13:14,850",Good.
708,"01:13:16,025","01:13:18,267",Because that's a true story.
709,"01:13:28,704","01:13:31,575",You see? Nothing to worry about.
710,"01:13:32,625","01:13:35,745","- Anyone fancy a cup of tea?
- Tea?"
711,"01:13:35,836","01:13:38,327","Aye. Nothing like a brew
to set you straight."
712,"01:13:38,422","01:13:42,751","No. No, I don't reckon
a brew's gonna do it this time."
713,"01:13:42,843","01:13:45,595","You said you were gonna
get us to lnverness."
714,"01:13:45,679","01:13:48,087","We wanna get out of here
as quickly as possible."
715,"01:13:49,808","01:13:51,801",Understood.
716,"01:13:51,935","01:13:55,185","Let me just get on to PC Stewart
and we'll see where he's got to."
717,"01:14:02,571","01:14:05,856","- You don't have to be so rude.
- Fuck rude! People are dead."
718,"01:14:05,991","01:14:09,027","I wanna get out of this village,
out of this fucking country."
719,"01:14:09,119","01:14:11,325",And we will. Relax. We're safe now.
720,"01:14:11,413","01:14:14,746","How long's he gonna take?
And where's this other officer?"
721,"01:14:14,833","01:14:16,742",Sure I can't tempt anyone with a cuppa?
722,"01:14:16,835","01:14:19,456","We were supposed to be in a police car
15 minutes ago."
723,"01:14:19,546","01:14:21,704","No, thanks! You're being paranoid."
724,"01:14:21,798","01:14:25,083","Well, did you actually see him
call for help? Did you hear it?"
725,"01:14:25,176","01:14:28,462","- Why haven't they returned his call?
- It's only been ten minutes."
726,"01:14:28,554","01:14:30,796","A lot can happen in ten minutes, Alison."
727,"01:14:31,683","01:14:35,550","Are you ready to trust someone we've
just met after what we've been through?"
728,"01:14:36,395","01:14:40,227","What if he's keeping us busy while he
waits for his mates to finish us off?"
729,"01:14:45,738","01:14:47,315",Shit!
730,"01:14:50,367","01:14:51,862","- What do we do?
- We should go."
731,"01:14:53,078","01:14:57,242","- Let's wait five minutes, see if...
- How much longer do you wanna wait for?"
732,"01:14:57,333","01:14:59,705","Even if he's not in on it,
what good's he gonna do?"
733,"01:14:59,793","01:15:03,625","What can he protect us from? He's a fat
man with a badge armed with a biro."
734,"01:15:03,714","01:15:06,798","No, I say we leave now.
We take our chances in the crowd."
735,"01:15:10,721","01:15:11,966",OK.
736,"01:15:12,055","01:15:14,842","Anna, we're just gonna go for a walk,
sweetheart."
737,"01:15:17,644","01:15:20,396","What's going on?
Where are you going?"
738,"01:15:20,480","01:15:21,643",We're just...
739,"01:15:21,731","01:15:23,523","- We're leaving.
- It's not safe."
740,"01:15:23,608","01:15:26,181","- Well, we're going.
- Absolutely not."
741,"01:15:26,277","01:15:29,362","You're my responsibility.
I'm not letting you out of my sight."
742,"01:15:29,447","01:15:31,819","You can't keep us here.
If we wanna go, we'll go."
743,"01:15:31,908","01:15:35,775","You want to walk out of here? Fine.
But I can't let you take the girl."
744,"01:15:37,205","01:15:40,206","I mean it. You leave,
you leave without her."
745,"01:15:40,792","01:15:42,250",Ed!
746,"01:15:43,002","01:15:46,418","- Don't come any closer.
- Easy, lad, easy."
747,"01:15:46,505","01:15:49,459","Don't do something
you'll have to pay for later."
748,"01:15:49,550","01:15:54,461",Put the knife down. Right now.
749,"01:15:55,639","01:15:57,679",What the...
750,"01:16:03,314","01:16:04,428",Get down!
751,"01:16:14,074","01:16:16,482","Stay low, stay low. Keep down."
752,"01:16:30,423","01:16:32,332","PC Stewart. Come in, over."
753,"01:16:33,259","01:16:38,799","Shots fired. I'm under
attack. I need you back at the station."
754,"01:16:46,564","01:16:48,355",Get back against the wall!
755,"01:16:48,441","01:16:53,103","- Hey, hey. Is there a back door?
- Yes. You'll need keys."
756,"01:16:53,195","01:16:54,820",Where?
757,"01:17:00,870","01:17:02,328",Follow me.
758,"01:17:03,289","01:17:05,080",Down! Get down!
759,"01:17:14,383","01:17:15,842","Anna, quick."
760,"01:18:00,928","01:18:04,012","Now what we have here
is a situation based on trust."
761,"01:18:04,098","01:18:06,850","I trust you when you say
that you've brought the money."
762,"01:18:08,477","01:18:13,104","And you have to trust me when I say
the girl is safe and somewhere nearby."
763,"01:18:14,692","01:18:16,815",I can't even walk into to a newsagent
764,"01:18:16,902","01:18:19,523","and buy a pack of cigarettes on trust,
my friend."
765,"01:18:20,114","01:18:23,198","Now, if I can't do that,"
766,"01:18:23,283","01:18:26,368","how do you expect me
to let a man like you"
767,"01:18:26,453","01:18:31,162","walk out of here with a fucking
retirement plan in a briefcase? Hmm?"
768,"01:18:34,294","01:18:35,954",Man like me?
769,"01:18:36,046","01:18:38,881","A kidnapper and a child murderer, yes."
770,"01:18:40,800","01:18:42,259",That's a bit personal.
771,"01:18:44,095","01:18:48,638","You're a grown man, you can take it.
And this is business."
772,"01:18:49,934","01:18:52,010",Like the man in the newsagent.
773,"01:18:54,772","01:18:58,058","I hand him the money
because I can see what I'm buying."
774,"01:18:58,151","01:19:01,566","It even comes with
a government health warning."
775,"01:19:01,654","01:19:07,241","He gives me what I want
and we both walk away happy."
776,"01:19:07,326","01:19:09,070","So, no."
777,"01:19:11,288","01:19:13,328",This is not based on trust.
778,"01:19:14,375","01:19:17,376","This is based
on what I can see in front of me."
779,"01:19:21,966","01:19:24,124",And you're getting nothing...
780,"01:19:25,969","01:19:28,377",..until I see the girl. Nothing.
781,"01:19:37,522","01:19:39,147",He's got a gun! Run!
782,"01:19:55,498","01:19:56,992","Hurry, hurry."
783,"01:19:57,667","01:19:59,078",Fuck!
784,"01:20:45,964","01:20:49,748","They don't have the girl.
They don't have the girl!"
785,"01:20:52,762","01:20:54,138",They've lost the girl.
786,"01:20:54,222","01:20:55,847",It's a bluff.
787,"01:21:41,769","01:21:43,311",Where are you?
788,"01:21:56,074","01:21:57,652","Hey, hey, I love you."
789,"01:22:15,677","01:22:17,337","How am I doing, mate?"
790,"01:22:21,557","01:22:25,637","Never mind the bollocks.
Give it me straight."
791,"01:22:28,356","01:22:32,223","It's gone straight through the vest
and made a wreck of you. You're dying."
792,"01:22:33,110","01:22:35,981","You don't have long
and there's nothing I can do."
793,"01:22:36,989","01:22:38,104","Just bad luck, mate."
794,"01:22:43,871","01:22:45,069",Gun.
795,"01:22:46,373","01:22:47,998",Gun.
796,"01:23:27,455","01:23:29,578",Hey! What's going on?
797,"01:23:44,597","01:23:45,759",Get down!
798,"01:24:23,468","01:24:26,469",You should have just given us the girl!
799,"01:24:32,101","01:24:34,972","Where has your compassion
gotten you today?"
800,"01:24:44,613","01:24:46,321",You fucking bitch!
801,"01:25:57,893","01:25:59,352",Hello again.
802,"01:28:32,544","01:28:34,667","Darko, you're a man of your word."
803,"01:29:32,144","01:29:33,852",It's OK.
804,"01:29:39,109","01:29:42,394","It's OK, Anna. It's OK."
805,"01:29:45,448","01:29:47,275",It's OK.
806,"01:30:23,861","01:30:28,072","- What the hell is this?
- This is her father. Now you get paid."
807,"01:30:28,157","01:30:30,149","If this starts to feel like an ambush,"
808,"01:30:30,242","01:30:32,780","I will take the top
of your fucking head off."
809,"01:30:33,662","01:30:37,031","- Just so we're clear.
- Stay in the car until I call for you."
810,"01:30:37,124","01:30:40,125","- Let me do the talking.
- Don't talk yourself out of a life."
811,"01:30:40,210","01:30:41,835",My employer is a businessman.
812,"01:30:42,879","01:30:45,086","Last I heard,
he was a fucking war criminal."
813,"01:30:45,173","01:30:46,715",Nice.
814,"01:31:48,193","01:31:50,233","500,000."
815,"01:31:51,154","01:31:53,194",I can get it for you in an hour.
816,"01:31:56,660","01:31:57,988",No?
817,"01:31:59,871","01:32:02,030",It was worth a try.
818,"01:32:03,041","01:32:06,540","My daughter must have looked like
a good payday to you."
819,"01:32:06,628","01:32:08,751",Divorce has made my ex-wife rich.
820,"01:32:08,838","01:32:10,961","There is very little
she could not afford."
821,"01:32:11,674","01:32:15,672","But behind every woman with money
is a man with deep pockets."
822,"01:32:15,762","01:32:18,928","You should have concerned yourself
with how he lined them."
823,"01:32:20,808","01:32:22,884",Strip that piece of shit.
824,"01:32:38,450","01:32:40,941",Darko tells me you lost a man.
825,"01:32:41,412","01:32:42,787",That's right.
826,"01:32:43,580","01:32:48,242","Don't cry too hard.
Now you won't have to split your fee."
827,"01:32:49,753","01:32:51,627",My daughter is safe.
828,"01:32:52,464","01:32:54,623",I am in debt to you.
829,"01:32:55,384","01:32:57,507",There's a way to fix that.
830,"01:32:59,429","01:33:01,552","Your account has
already been credited."
831,"01:33:03,225","01:33:07,056",You can keep the car. A parting gift.
832,"01:33:20,116","01:33:23,532",Put him in the ground. Prepare my tools.
833,"01:34:17,881","01:34:20,004",Do you understand what she said?
834,"01:34:22,260","01:34:24,632","I think she said ""thank you""."
835,"01:34:40,486","01:34:42,562","Are you alright, sweetheart?"
836,"01:34:47,118","01:34:48,280",Yeah.
