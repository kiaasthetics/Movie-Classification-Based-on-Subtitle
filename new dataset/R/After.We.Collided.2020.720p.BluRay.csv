is a collection of memoranda"
2,"00:01:17,078","00:01:20,948","that she did exist,
and that I have lost her."
3,"00:01:20,991","00:01:23,251","Whatever our souls
are made of,"
4,"00:01:23,295","00:01:25,774",hers and mine are the same.
5,"00:01:26,208","00:01:29,121","A rather pretentious way
to open our story..."
6,"00:01:29,164","00:01:31,643","but I've always
had a flair for the dramatic."
7,"00:01:31,687","00:01:34,556","You see, this isour story..."
8,"00:01:34,600","00:01:36,469",Tessa's and mine.
9,"00:01:36,512","00:01:38,295","It's a story
you've heard before,"
10,"00:01:38,338","00:01:41,164","passed down from the Greeks,
through Shakespeare,"
11,"00:01:41,208","00:01:43,817","the Brontes, Jane Austen."
12,"00:01:44,382","00:01:47,861","It's the story of a young girl
exploring her independence,"
13,"00:01:47,904","00:01:50,817","free from the bonds
of her oppressive parent..."
14,"00:01:50,861","00:01:54,600","and promised to a boy
she clearly does not love."
15,"00:01:54,643","00:01:56,904","She meets a dashingly
handsome young man"
16,"00:01:56,948","00:01:59,251",who sweeps her off her feet...
17,"00:01:59,295","00:02:03,164","even though he represents
everything she detests."
18,"00:02:03,208","00:02:05,251","She falls for him,"
19,"00:02:05,295","00:02:07,512","gives herself to him,"
20,"00:02:07,556","00:02:10,251","and is ultimately
betrayed by him"
21,"00:02:10,295","00:02:12,425",and left shattered.
22,"00:02:13,251","00:02:17,208","Only it is he who is
destroyed by his deceit."
23,"00:02:17,817","00:02:20,121","When it feels as though
all is lost,"
24,"00:02:20,164","00:02:24,469","the two reunite
and live happily ever after."
25,"00:02:24,512","00:02:28,600","Like I've said,
a story you've heard before."
26,"00:02:28,643","00:02:30,774",Only difference is...
27,"00:02:31,078","00:02:33,251",this isn't that story.
28,"00:03:21,817","00:03:24,164",Hey. Can I ask you a question?
29,"00:03:24,208","00:03:26,556","- Piss off.
- I'm looking for someone."
30,"00:03:26,600","00:03:28,295",Piss off!
31,"00:03:46,078","00:03:49,774","Whoo! Sure don't seem
like Christmas out here,"
32,"00:03:49,817","00:03:51,948","all this heat
we've been havin'."
33,"00:03:51,991","00:03:54,512","Ya know, I hate the heat."
34,"00:03:54,556","00:03:57,469","Heat make people
do some crazy things."
35,"00:03:57,512","00:03:59,730",Hoo!
36,"00:04:11,295","00:04:13,425",Thank... Thank you!
37,"00:04:13,774","00:04:15,904",Sorry.
38,"00:04:18,948","00:04:21,425","Excuse me! Sir, can you
hold that elevator, please!"
39,"00:04:21,469","00:04:23,600",Asswipe!
40,"00:04:27,904","00:04:30,164",Thank you.
41,"00:04:31,121","00:04:33,382","Did you call me
an asswipe?"
42,"00:04:33,425","00:04:35,164",Excuse me?
43,"00:04:35,208","00:04:38,078","You just called me
an asswipe."
44,"00:04:38,121","00:04:40,208","Um, no. I didn't."
45,"00:04:40,991","00:04:43,600","Yeah, I guess
I just imagined it."
46,"00:04:43,643","00:04:45,730",Guess so.
47,"00:04:46,164","00:04:49,121","Ya know,
I was trying to hold the elevator for you."
48,"00:04:49,164","00:04:51,295",Sure you were.
49,"00:04:53,904","00:04:56,121","Look, I'm sorry.
It's my first day."
50,"00:04:56,164","00:04:58,121","I'm just trying
to make an impression."
51,"00:04:58,164","00:05:01,861","Well, you certainly
succeeded at that."
52,"00:05:03,600","00:05:05,687",Asswipe.
53,"00:05:12,295","00:05:13,512","No, no, no, no..."
54,"00:05:13,556","00:05:15,208","- You work here?
- Surprise."
55,"00:05:15,251","00:05:16,469",Tessa!
56,"00:05:16,512","00:05:18,164","Welcome to
Vance Publishing."
57,"00:05:18,208","00:05:19,730","Hi. Kimberly, right?"
58,"00:05:19,774","00:05:21,512",Excellent memory.I'm impressed.
59,"00:05:21,556","00:05:23,078","Yes, she makes
quite the impression."
60,"00:05:23,121","00:05:23,991",You two know each other?
61,"00:05:24,035","00:05:26,425",Uh... we're old friends.
62,"00:05:26,469","00:05:28,730","Now, if you ladies
will excuse me?"
63,"00:05:28,774","00:05:30,512",- Are you excited to get going?- Yeah.
64,"00:05:30,556","00:05:32,817",Let's introduce youto the boss.
65,"00:05:32,861","00:05:36,164","Shut the fuck up
and listen to me!"
66,"00:05:36,208","00:05:38,817","This might not be the
best time for introductions."
67,"00:05:38,861","00:05:42,121","Why don't I
show you your office?"
68,"00:05:42,164","00:05:44,035",Trevor!
69,"00:05:44,078","00:05:46,208",On it.
70,"00:05:50,556","00:05:52,338",I apologize for the mess.
71,"00:05:52,382","00:05:53,904","We've been short on interns lately,"
72,"00:05:53,948","00:05:55,512",and we're a bit back logged.
73,"00:05:55,556","00:05:57,078",That seems crazy to me.
74,"00:05:57,121","00:05:59,251","People I know would kill
for an internship here."
75,"00:05:59,295","00:06:00,687","I know, it's just that Vance"
76,"00:06:00,730","00:06:02,774",has this small problem with
77,"00:06:02,817","00:06:04,295",firing them after a day.
78,"00:06:04,338","00:06:05,643","But that's not
going to happen to you."
79,"00:06:05,687","00:06:07,600",I have a good feeling about this.
80,"00:06:07,643","00:06:09,904","But like I said
during the interview,"
81,"00:06:09,948","00:06:11,687","your job is to read five
manuscripts a week,"
82,"00:06:11,730","00:06:14,121","and if you like them,
just forward them on to me."
83,"00:06:14,164","00:06:16,382","- Okay.
- The kitchen is right down the hall."
84,"00:06:16,425","00:06:18,600","Feel free to place
any order for lunch."
85,"00:06:18,643","00:06:20,948","- Any questions?
- Uh, no. I'm good."
86,"00:06:20,991","00:06:23,251",You got this.
87,"00:07:19,164","00:07:21,425",Mmm.
88,"00:07:22,251","00:07:24,338",Mr. Vance!
89,"00:07:25,078","00:07:27,121","Um... Um, I'm so sorry."
90,"00:07:27,164","00:07:28,643",I must have dozed off.
91,"00:07:28,687","00:07:30,948","-What time is it?
-9:25."
92,"00:07:32,774","00:07:34,904",9:25?
93,"00:07:34,948","00:07:37,078","- Am I fired?
- Sit down."
94,"00:07:37,774","00:07:39,948","You mean to tell me
you read three books"
95,"00:07:39,991","00:07:42,164","and did coverage
on all of them last night,"
96,"00:07:42,208","00:07:46,774","and you think Carnival of Light
by Niko Tanaka is a great read?"
97,"00:07:46,817","00:07:48,643","Yeah, it is. It's, uh,"
98,"00:07:48,687","00:07:50,208","she has a really original voice,"
99,"00:07:50,251","00:07:52,382","it's a lot like
an early Margaret Atwood,"
100,"00:07:52,425","00:07:53,861","- The Edible Woman,"
101,"00:07:53,904","00:07:57,164","- Surfacing...
- I'm coming down now."
102,"00:07:57,817","00:08:00,121","Grab your things.
Come with me."
103,"00:08:00,164","00:08:02,295","Oh, shit."
104,"00:08:07,512","00:08:09,121","Morning, Mr. Vance."
105,"00:08:09,164","00:08:11,251","- Morning, sir.
- Mr. Vance, I was just..."
106,"00:08:11,295","00:08:13,425","I was wondering if we
had time to go back to..."
107,"00:08:13,469","00:08:14,861",Get in.
108,"00:08:14,904","00:08:17,425","Because I have to get
my phone charger in at..."
109,"00:08:17,469","00:08:20,078","Oh, we're closing the door!"
110,"00:08:21,687","00:08:23,904",Little work tip.
111,"00:08:23,948","00:08:24,599",Hmm?
112,"00:08:24,623","00:08:26,600","It helps if you don't wear
the same clothes every day."
113,"00:08:26,643","00:08:28,121","That, and showering."
114,"00:08:31,687","00:08:33,643","Um, where are we going?"
115,"00:08:33,687","00:08:35,600","There's a digital
publishing conference,"
116,"00:08:35,643","00:08:37,730","and I need to secure
some funding for my expansion."
117,"00:08:41,861","00:08:43,948",Fuck off!
118,"00:08:45,121","00:08:48,208","What part of ""We're closed""don't..."
119,"00:08:48,251","00:08:49,774","- Hi.
- You busy?"
120,"00:08:49,817","00:08:51,730",Kind of in the middle of something.
121,"00:08:51,774","00:08:56,164","So, you know,
why don't you come back tomorrow?"
122,"00:08:56,208","00:08:58,600",Or just come in right now.
123,"00:09:03,425","00:09:04,774",I'm good.
124,"00:09:04,817","00:09:07,600","Come on, it'll ease the pain."
125,"00:09:08,295","00:09:10,643",I like the pain.
126,"00:09:10,687","00:09:14,687","Well, suit yourself, you fuckin' masochist."
127,"00:09:20,425","00:09:22,295","Welcome back the Montgomery,
Mr. Vance."
128,"00:09:22,338","00:09:24,208","I have your rooms
ready for you."
129,"00:09:24,251","00:09:26,817","We had a printer delivered
to Mr. Trevor Matthews' room."
130,"00:09:26,861","00:09:28,991","Unfortunately,
Ms. Young's room wasn't ready,"
131,"00:09:29,035","00:09:31,556","so we had her upgraded to a suite
with compliments of the management."
132,"00:09:31,600","00:09:33,164","Has Mr. Jiang
checked in yet?"
133,"00:09:33,208","00:09:34,817","I do believe
he's at the bar."
134,"00:09:34,861","00:09:36,121",Of course he is.
135,"00:09:36,164","00:09:38,382","So I get a printer
and you get a suite."
136,"00:09:38,425","00:09:39,687","You're enjoying this,
aren't you?"
137,"00:09:39,730","00:09:41,556",Definitely.
138,"00:09:41,600","00:09:43,338","Hon', do you mind
taking Tessa shopping?"
139,"00:09:43,382","00:09:44,643","She needs something
for tonight."
140,"00:09:44,687","00:09:46,774",I trust you.
141,"00:09:47,948","00:09:50,121",Let's go have some fun.
142,"00:09:52,687","00:09:54,295","Are you sure
that I can get in?"
143,"00:09:54,338","00:09:56,338","Because I've never been
to a nightclub before."
144,"00:09:56,382","00:09:58,338",But don't they check...?
145,"00:09:58,382","00:10:01,904",You'll be with us.It won't be a problem.
146,"00:10:01,948","00:10:04,600","Look, before we go outside,"
147,"00:10:05,078","00:10:06,600","I just wanted
to tell you something."
148,"00:10:06,643","00:10:07,687",Okay.
149,"00:10:07,730","00:10:09,861",Vance and I are...
150,"00:10:10,730","00:10:12,861",more than co-workers.
151,"00:10:13,295","00:10:14,904",Oh.
152,"00:10:14,948","00:10:17,991","It was strictly
a work thing for years,"
153,"00:10:18,035","00:10:19,687","especially after
his wife died,"
154,"00:10:19,730","00:10:22,643","then I started helping out
with his son Smith,"
155,"00:10:22,687","00:10:26,208","and, well, love can
really take you by surprise."
156,"00:10:26,251","00:10:28,295","Yes, it can."
157,"00:10:31,904","00:10:33,556","- That's him?
- Mm-hmm."
158,"00:10:33,600","00:10:36,295","- Aw.
- He's the sweetest kid."
159,"00:10:37,208","00:10:39,338",Ohh.
160,"00:10:39,382","00:10:43,035","Can't wait for them to see you
in this dress tonight."
161,"00:10:43,078","00:10:45,208","Oh, shoot."
162,"00:10:45,774","00:10:47,164","We forgot
to buy you underwear."
163,"00:10:47,208","00:10:49,121","But my clothes
are at the laundry."
164,"00:10:49,164","00:10:51,512","If I leave now,
I can run back to the mall..."
165,"00:10:51,556","00:10:53,035","Oh, no, no, no.
No. It's fine."
166,"00:10:53,078","00:10:55,208","- Are you sure?
- Yeah."
167,"00:10:55,861","00:10:59,208","Okay, I guess
we're goin' commando, then."
168,"00:11:05,164","00:11:07,643","I can't believe I've been
at Vance for only a day."
169,"00:11:07,687","00:11:11,251","Well,
Hardin said we'd be lucky to have you."
170,"00:11:11,295","00:11:14,904","- You spoke to Hardin.
- No, Vance did."
171,"00:11:14,948","00:11:16,687",He didn't tell you?
172,"00:11:16,730","00:11:19,382",Must have slipped his mind.
173,"00:11:50,991","00:11:55,948","Yes, well, as long as we're
at the conference by two..."
174,"00:11:58,687","00:12:00,469",Wow.
175,"00:12:00,512","00:12:02,600",You clean up nicely.
176,"00:12:03,643","00:12:05,817","Gee, Trevor,
you sure know how to charm the ladies."
177,"00:12:05,861","00:12:07,469","Tessa, you look stunning."
178,"00:12:07,512","00:12:09,338",Thank you.
179,"00:12:09,382","00:12:11,512",On the move.
180,"00:12:22,512","00:12:24,338","So what books
have you written?"
181,"00:12:24,382","00:12:26,512","Oh, this and that."
182,"00:12:33,251","00:12:35,251","Feel like I'm sitting
at the kids' table."
183,"00:12:35,295","00:12:36,817",Thanks.
184,"00:12:36,861","00:12:39,035","No, that's not what I meant.
Sorry."
185,"00:12:39,078","00:12:40,512",I hate nightclubs.
186,"00:12:40,556","00:12:42,643","Probably because
I suck at dancing."
187,"00:12:42,687","00:12:44,861","I love Ohio football,
but I hate nightclubs."
188,"00:12:44,904","00:12:47,035",Why are we here?
189,"00:12:47,948","00:12:49,600",Him.
190,"00:12:49,643","00:12:51,600",Mr. Jiang.
191,"00:12:51,643","00:12:54,078","His family owns
a hedge fund worth 800 million"
192,"00:12:54,121","00:12:57,643","and it's considering
investing in Vance's expansion."
193,"00:12:57,687","00:12:58,817","You want me
to get you a drink?"
194,"00:12:58,861","00:13:00,425",I'm gonna stick with water.
195,"00:13:00,469","00:13:02,556","All my budget
really allows these days."
196,"00:13:02,600","00:13:04,600","I thought you were
a paid intern."
197,"00:13:04,643","00:13:07,556","You'd be surprised how
much Uber charges can add up."
198,"00:13:07,600","00:13:09,817","I mean, I'd be lucky
to break even."
199,"00:13:12,904","00:13:15,164","- I'll go.
- What it is?"
200,"00:13:17,687","00:13:19,774",Sex on the Beach.
201,"00:13:20,687","00:13:21,991",Quite a beach.
202,"00:13:24,512","00:13:28,121","Grab a straw. On your mark,
get set, go."
203,"00:13:34,425","00:13:36,643",It's really good.
204,"00:13:36,687","00:13:38,991","Mr. Jiang, have you had a
chance to look at my numbers yet?"
205,"00:13:39,035","00:13:40,861","With the forecast of
rising interest rates..."
206,"00:13:41,948","00:13:43,382",Again. Just...
207,"00:13:43,425","00:13:45,556",Yeah.
208,"00:13:48,164","00:13:50,904","We're gonna
get fucked up tonight!"
209,"00:14:08,469","00:14:11,251","Well, well, look what
the cat dragged in."
210,"00:14:11,295","00:14:13,164","That's a stupid
fucking expression."
211,"00:14:13,208","00:14:15,469","Why would a cat
drag me anywhere?"
212,"00:14:15,512","00:14:17,600","Welcome back, bro."
213,"00:14:21,208","00:14:23,338",Did you miss us?
214,"00:14:31,817","00:14:33,948","Wait.
I don't get it."
215,"00:14:33,991","00:14:36,121",Of course you don't.
216,"00:14:36,991","00:14:39,121",This is great!
217,"00:14:42,164","00:14:44,948",I feel like dancing!
218,"00:14:53,948","00:14:55,643",Guess who.
219,"00:14:55,687","00:14:57,078","Okay, I'll give you a hint."
220,"00:14:57,121","00:14:59,469","She's super fuckin' hot,a lot of fun,"
221,"00:14:59,512","00:15:01,425",and loves to fuck.
222,"00:15:01,469","00:15:03,774","- Mother Teresa.
- No. Ew."
223,"00:15:04,338","00:15:06,512",Ta-da!
224,"00:15:06,556","00:15:09,600","I know, I look amazing. I've had,
like, no carbs in eight weeks,"
225,"00:15:09,643","00:15:11,600","- but I'm feeling fucking fantastic.
- Wow."
226,"00:15:11,643","00:15:13,512","Yeah, its from the lack of
carbs and not all the blow."
227,"00:15:13,556","00:15:14,817",Don't you have some carpets to munch on?
228,"00:15:14,861","00:15:16,121","Don't you have
some dick to suck?"
229,"00:16:19,425","00:16:22,687","What do I have to do
to make you forgive me?"
230,"00:16:22,730","00:16:25,687","- I know I've been really bad.
- Worse than bad."
231,"00:16:25,730","00:16:28,556","Yeah, but you like it
when I'm bad."
232,"00:16:28,600","00:16:30,687",You know you miss me.
233,"00:16:34,774","00:16:36,904",Now get the fuck off me.
234,"00:16:38,295","00:16:39,469",Whoa!
235,"00:16:39,512","00:16:41,730","What the fuck, Hardin?!"
236,"00:16:42,382","00:16:44,512","Hardin, you didn't mind fucking me before,
though, right?"
237,"00:16:44,556","00:16:46,643","Oh, let me guess."
238,"00:16:47,078","00:16:49,338","You're still moping
over that stuck-up bitch."
239,"00:16:49,382","00:16:50,904","Don't fuckin' talk about her,
okay?!"
240,"00:16:50,948","00:16:53,687","Look at you. You look
like a lost little puppy"
241,"00:16:53,730","00:16:55,600","over some
Virgin Mary-turned-skank"
242,"00:16:55,643","00:16:59,600",- who doesn't even want you!
243,"00:16:59,643","00:17:01,730","Ohhh, God."
244,"00:17:02,078","00:17:04,556","What the fuck you looking at,freshman?"
245,"00:17:04,600","00:17:09,425","You want me to steal your
boyfriend? So turn the fuck around."
246,"00:17:09,469","00:17:11,600",I look hot.
247,"00:17:22,208","00:17:23,251",Tessa?
248,"00:17:23,295","00:17:24,948","Hi! I just, uh,"
249,"00:17:24,991","00:17:26,469",I just wanted to inform you
250,"00:17:26,512","00:17:28,600","that I look hot,"
251,"00:17:28,643","00:17:30,035",and you're missing it.
252,"00:17:30,078","00:17:32,164","Tessa, where are you?"
253,"00:17:32,208","00:17:34,035","Whoo! Somewhere
that you're not."
254,"00:17:34,078","00:17:36,817","Tess, I have your location,
I can find you."
255,"00:17:36,861","00:17:39,512","- How much have you
had to drink?"
256,"00:17:39,556","00:17:41,556","I don't know, like five?"
257,"00:17:41,600","00:17:42,600",Five what?
258,"00:17:42,643","00:17:44,774","Uh, Sex on the Beaches."
259,"00:17:45,600","00:17:48,295",Or is it Sexes on the Beaches?
260,"00:17:49,121","00:17:51,208",That coulda been fun!
261,"00:17:51,251","00:17:52,904",You are wasted.
262,"00:17:52,948","00:17:55,295","Oh, hey, Hardin?
I'm the commander."
263,"00:17:55,338","00:17:57,643","I've been the commander
all night."
264,"00:17:57,687","00:17:59,251",Command...
265,"00:17:59,295","00:18:00,774",What's it called?
266,"00:18:00,817","00:18:03,687","I'm not wearing
any underwear!"
267,"00:18:03,730","00:18:05,861","- Aaah! Ha ha ha!
- Tess, who are you with?"
268,"00:18:05,904","00:18:07,861",Why haven't you called me?
269,"00:18:07,904","00:18:09,295","I've texted you
a hundred times!"
270,"00:18:09,338","00:18:10,556",You haven't replied!
271,"00:18:10,600","00:18:12,425","I actually have to go,"
272,"00:18:12,469","00:18:14,948","but it was nice talking to you,
Mr. Hardin Scott,"
273,"00:18:14,991","00:18:16,425",so goodbye.
274,"00:18:16,469","00:18:19,600",- Don't fu... Te...
275,"00:18:20,251","00:18:21,556",Tessa.
276,"00:18:21,600","00:18:23,600",Trevor!
277,"00:18:23,643","00:18:26,251","I'm drunk, uncomfortable,
and I saw a tampon on the ground."
278,"00:18:26,295","00:18:27,861","- I'm leaving.
- Yeah, no, me too."
279,"00:18:27,904","00:18:29,512",Can we order room service?
280,"00:18:29,556","00:18:31,687",I... I want French fries
281,"00:18:32,556","00:18:34,687",and... ice cream.
282,"00:18:34,730","00:18:36,861",Dow!
283,"00:18:39,121","00:18:41,861","Nothin' like a vanilla sundae
at three in the morning."
284,"00:18:41,904","00:18:44,208","Yeah,
it sounded better in the moment."
285,"00:18:46,425","00:18:48,643","- So... Tessa.
- Hmm."
286,"00:18:48,687","00:18:50,600","- Tessa Young.
- Mm-hmm."
287,"00:18:50,643","00:18:52,687",Why the hell are you in publishing?
288,"00:18:52,730","00:18:54,904","Well, I love to read..."
289,"00:18:56,208","00:18:58,338",That makes sense.
290,"00:18:58,774","00:19:00,861",What's your favorite book?
291,"00:19:00,904","00:19:05,035","It's The Principles of Economics
by Alfred Marshall."
292,"00:19:05,078","00:19:06,991","- No, it's not.
- Yeah, it is."
293,"00:19:07,035","00:19:09,164","No, I mean...
I mean, like, fiction."
294,"00:19:09,208","00:19:11,164",Like... Like a real book.
295,"00:19:11,208","00:19:13,164",I don't do fiction.
296,"00:19:13,208","00:19:14,904","I mean, have you seen
how I dress?"
297,"00:19:14,948","00:19:16,600","- You heathen!
- Heathen?"
298,"00:19:16,643","00:19:18,295",You heathen!
299,"00:19:18,338","00:19:20,643","Fiction's an escape
from reality,"
300,"00:19:20,687","00:19:22,600","it's a way that, like,
you can live a hundred lives,"
301,"00:19:22,643","00:19:24,035",or even a thousand.
302,"00:19:24,078","00:19:25,730","I don't need to live
a thousand lives."
303,"00:19:25,774","00:19:29,600",Okay? And I would rather watch paint dry.
304,"00:19:30,643","00:19:33,469","I, um, that wasn't..."
305,"00:19:33,512","00:19:35,774","No, I... that wasn't
supposed to happen."
306,"00:19:49,035","00:19:50,948","Look, I'm telling you,
I know what I'm doing."
307,"00:19:50,991","00:19:54,687","We just have to soak it
before it stains."
308,"00:19:55,991","00:19:57,469",Can I have your pants?
309,"00:19:57,512","00:19:59,425","- Tessa...
- Gimme your pants!"
310,"00:19:59,469","00:20:02,164",Otherwise it's gonna stain.
311,"00:20:09,382","00:20:11,643",- Tessa!
312,"00:20:11,687","00:20:13,512","- Tessa, open the door.
- Is that Hardin Scott?"
313,"00:20:13,556","00:20:16,164",- Open the door!
314,"00:20:19,512","00:20:21,295",Hi.
315,"00:20:21,338","00:20:24,904","Are you trying to get me
kicked out of this place?"
316,"00:20:24,948","00:20:27,730","Yeah,come on in, why don't you?"
317,"00:20:27,774","00:20:29,904",Hey...
318,"00:20:31,643","00:20:33,164","Hey, Hardin,
didn't see ya. How ya been?"
319,"00:20:33,208","00:20:35,774","- Fucking Trevor?!
- Time to go, I think."
320,"00:20:35,817","00:20:37,295","- I'm just gonna...
- No, you're not."
321,"00:20:37,338","00:20:39,295","- I just wanna talk to him!
- No! No..."
322,"00:20:39,338","00:20:41,164","- Tessa... Tessa...
- Stop!"
323,"00:20:41,208","00:20:43,643","- Hardin,
I think this is a mis... Fuck off."
324,"00:20:43,687","00:20:45,861",You're such a dick.Why are you even here?
325,"00:20:45,904","00:20:47,600",I'ma dick?
326,"00:20:47,643","00:20:49,774","I'm not the one taking
advantage of drunk girls."
327,"00:20:49,817","00:20:51,730",You... You do know that not every guy
328,"00:20:51,774","00:20:54,164","is trying to getin my pants, right?"
329,"00:20:54,208","00:20:56,469","- You'd be surprised.
- You can't tell me"
330,"00:20:56,512","00:20:59,035","who I can and can't have sex with,
because it's none of your business anymore!"
331,"00:20:59,078","00:21:01,643","- Were you going to have sex with him?
- Oh, my God!"
332,"00:21:01,687","00:21:03,035","- What?
- You're insane!"
333,"00:21:03,078","00:21:06,035",You're avoiding the question.
334,"00:21:11,904","00:21:13,425",What if I was?
335,"00:21:13,469","00:21:15,600",What?
336,"00:21:16,904","00:21:19,035",You heard me.
337,"00:21:19,817","00:21:22,121",What if I was?
338,"00:21:22,164","00:21:24,425","What,
you don't like that?"
339,"00:21:24,469","00:21:27,382","You don't like the
idea of Trevor's hands..."
340,"00:21:27,425","00:21:29,512",all over my body?
341,"00:21:30,164","00:21:32,295",Touching me?
342,"00:21:36,774","00:21:38,861",I've missed this.
343,"00:21:38,904","00:21:42,295","- Tessa, you're drunk.
- Mm-hmm. So?"
344,"00:21:43,512","00:21:45,687",Tess...
345,"00:21:45,730","00:21:47,121",Hmm!
346,"00:21:47,164","00:21:48,425",You don't want this?
347,"00:21:48,469","00:21:51,164","Of course I want this,
but I..."
348,"00:21:51,556","00:21:54,991","Hardin... you have
two options here."
349,"00:21:56,600","00:21:58,643","Either you fuck me,"
350,"00:21:58,687","00:22:00,948",or you leave.
351,"00:22:00,991","00:22:03,078",You decide.
352,"00:22:29,078","00:22:31,208",Ohh.
353,"00:22:36,512","00:22:39,338","- Do you have a condom?
- Are you sure?"
354,"00:22:39,382","00:22:41,382","- Why not.
- You'll hate me tomorrow."
355,"00:22:41,425","00:22:44,382","Yeah, well,
I hate you already."
356,"00:22:58,861","00:23:00,687",Tell me I'm the only one.
357,"00:23:00,730","00:23:02,774",You're the only one.
358,"00:23:25,121","00:23:27,251",Mmm.
359,"00:23:42,904","00:23:44,251","- Hi!
- Morning!"
360,"00:23:44,295","00:23:45,948","- Kimberly!
- You up?"
361,"00:23:45,991","00:23:47,600","Yeah... no, yeah,
I've been up for a while."
362,"00:23:47,643","00:23:49,295","- See you down in five.
- Five minutes?"
363,"00:23:49,338","00:23:51,208","- Problem?
- Nope, not a problem."
364,"00:23:51,251","00:23:53,164","- Meet you in the lobby.
- Okay, I'll be right down."
365,"00:23:53,208","00:23:55,817","- Don't be late.
- Okay. Bye."
366,"00:23:56,904","00:23:59,035",Shit!
367,"00:24:02,861","00:24:05,035",Where are my clothes?!
368,"00:24:10,295","00:24:12,425",Ohh!
369,"00:24:14,338","00:24:15,991",Tessa!
370,"00:24:16,035","00:24:18,164",Come back to bed.
371,"00:24:19,382","00:24:21,251",Tessa!
372,"00:24:21,295","00:24:23,643","What?!
What do you want?!"
373,"00:24:24,208","00:24:27,164","The other Tessa.
The one who's nice?"
374,"00:24:27,208","00:24:30,251","Yeah, well,
she's late for work."
375,"00:24:34,512","00:24:36,208","-Where are my...
-Why are you so..."
376,"00:24:36,251","00:24:38,382",Hey! Privacy!
377,"00:24:38,904","00:24:41,295","Privacy. After what
we did last night,"
378,"00:24:41,338","00:24:42,512",you want privacy?
379,"00:24:42,556","00:24:43,687",Don't remind me.
380,"00:24:43,730","00:24:45,643","Hey,
you called me."
381,"00:24:45,687","00:24:47,774","I didn't tell you
to come here."
382,"00:24:47,817","00:24:49,861","Okay, I'm starting
to get the feeling"
383,"00:24:49,904","00:24:51,991","you're not entirely cool
with what happened last night."
384,"00:24:52,035","00:24:53,425","No, I'm not cool with it."
385,"00:24:53,469","00:24:54,948","Well, do you want
to talk about it?"
386,"00:24:54,991","00:24:57,078",Nope. You hurt me and I can't forgive you.
387,"00:24:57,121","00:24:58,687","- That's it.
- So last night meant nothing."
388,"00:24:58,730","00:25:00,121",I was drunk.
389,"00:25:00,164","00:25:02,991","I called you,
you came here..."
390,"00:25:03,948","00:25:05,121",I made a mistake.
391,"00:25:05,164","00:25:06,730",But you obviously missed me.
392,"00:25:06,774","00:25:08,774","I didn't know
what I was doing."
393,"00:25:08,817","00:25:10,469","- From kissing that guy, to...
- What?"
394,"00:25:10,512","00:25:12,251","- What?
- From kissing?"
395,"00:25:12,295","00:25:13,991","- What did you say?
- I didn't say anything."
396,"00:25:14,035","00:25:15,643","- You said ""kissing that guy.""
- No."
397,"00:25:15,687","00:25:17,512","- What?! T...
- I need to go."
398,"00:25:17,556","00:25:19,512","Tessa, wait. Tessa!"
399,"00:25:19,556","00:25:22,208",- Tessa!
400,"00:25:23,035","00:25:25,164",Put your clothes on!
401,"00:25:26,295","00:25:28,512","- Who did you kiss?
- No one!"
402,"00:25:28,556","00:25:29,730","- Was it Trevor?
- No!"
403,"00:25:29,774","00:25:31,208",My Tessa would never
404,"00:25:31,251","00:25:32,643","kiss a fuckin' stranger
at a club."
405,"00:25:32,687","00:25:34,861","There is no ""your Tessa""
anymore!"
406,"00:25:34,904","00:25:40,861","Yeah, well, when you were kissing that guy,
I was fucking Molly."
407,"00:25:43,600","00:25:45,687",Fuck you!
408,"00:25:50,425","00:25:52,556",Fuck!
409,"00:25:57,556","00:25:59,643","- Oh!
- Sorry."
410,"00:26:01,295","00:26:03,425",Hi.
411,"00:26:03,904","00:26:05,817","- Hi.
- Got us some lattes."
412,"00:26:05,861","00:26:07,469",Thank you.
413,"00:26:09,730","00:26:11,687",Oh. Thank you.
414,"00:26:11,730","00:26:14,208","So, interesting night."
415,"00:26:14,251","00:26:18,121","Trevor, I'm... so sorry
about last night."
416,"00:26:18,164","00:26:20,643","No, don't be. If I showed up
to my girlfriend's hotel room"
417,"00:26:20,687","00:26:23,600","and I saw a half-naked,incredibly
handsome man there,"
418,"00:26:23,643","00:26:24,817",I'd react the same way.
419,"00:26:24,861","00:26:26,774",Is he still lurking around?
420,"00:26:26,817","00:26:28,991",Should I be hiding in the van?
421,"00:26:29,035","00:26:30,643","He's the one that
should be hiding,"
422,"00:26:30,687","00:26:32,991",and we are not together.
423,"00:26:34,730","00:26:37,295","How do you two
know each other?"
424,"00:26:37,338","00:26:40,556","- Hardin worked at Vance last year.
- He did?"
425,"00:26:40,600","00:26:42,948","Yeah. Same position as you,actually."
426,"00:26:42,991","00:26:44,600",Kind of a sad story.
427,"00:26:44,643","00:26:47,512","We were best of friends,
and..."
428,"00:26:47,556","00:26:49,295","then we became lovers,"
429,"00:26:49,338","00:26:52,512","and then I found
a red hair on my pillow."
430,"00:26:52,556","00:26:54,643",Hilarious.
431,"00:26:54,948","00:26:56,600","Ya know,
I didn't peg you as the bad boy type."
432,"00:26:56,643","00:26:59,774","We'll save that
for another time."
433,"00:27:00,600","00:27:02,643",My hero. Ohh.
434,"00:27:02,687","00:27:04,730","Anyone else
feel like death?"
435,"00:27:04,774","00:27:07,643","I don't know what you two
said or did to Neil last night,"
436,"00:27:07,687","00:27:10,600","but he just wrote a humongous
check to finance our expansion."
437,"00:27:10,643","00:27:12,730",Good job.
438,"00:27:25,164","00:27:26,730",What are you doing here?
439,"00:27:26,774","00:27:28,774",I need some advice.
440,"00:27:28,817","00:27:30,382",Advice?
441,"00:27:30,425","00:27:32,208","You want advice
from me?"
442,"00:27:32,251","00:27:33,948",Yeah.
443,"00:27:33,991","00:27:35,556",I'm that desperate.
444,"00:27:35,600","00:27:37,643","Oh, insults. Great."
445,"00:27:37,687","00:27:39,861","I thought you were an
imposter for a second."
446,"00:27:39,904","00:27:42,600","- Look, bro, I know I-
- No, step-bro."
447,"00:27:42,643","00:27:45,556","I'm not your brother.You
made that very clear."
448,"00:27:45,600","00:27:47,904","And if I was Tessa,I'd never
speak to you again, Hardin."
449,"00:27:47,948","00:27:50,817","- It's unforgiveable.
- You think I don't know that?!"
450,"00:27:50,861","00:27:52,817","I know I fucked up!
I know!"
451,"00:27:52,861","00:27:55,948","She won't return my calls
or texts."
452,"00:27:55,991","00:27:58,164","I found out
she kissed some guy."
453,"00:27:58,208","00:28:00,687","And... And I told her
I fucked Molly."
454,"00:28:00,730","00:28:03,078","- You slept with Molly?
- No, I said I did."
455,"00:28:03,121","00:28:04,687","That's the point.
I didn't."
456,"00:28:04,730","00:28:06,338","I said it to
get back at her,"
457,"00:28:06,382","00:28:08,774","and I-I realized
how stupid that was."
458,"00:28:08,817","00:28:10,861","- Yeah.
- Oh, fuck this!"
459,"00:28:10,904","00:28:14,556","So you're just gonna run away
like you do from everything. Right?"
460,"00:28:14,600","00:28:16,817","- Where you goin'?
- London."
461,"00:28:16,861","00:28:19,078","I was going to
take her with me."
462,"00:28:19,121","00:28:20,861",I'll see you next year.
463,"00:28:20,904","00:28:23,904","Hardin, do you really love her?"
464,"00:28:23,948","00:28:26,078",No bullshit.
465,"00:28:27,121","00:28:28,556",Yes.
466,"00:28:28,600","00:28:30,251","Of course
I fucking love her."
467,"00:28:30,295","00:28:33,600","I've never felt this way
about anyone before!"
468,"00:28:33,643","00:28:37,338","Just wish I didn't
fuck the whole thing up."
469,"00:29:13,643","00:29:15,730",Focus.
470,"00:29:17,338","00:29:18,687",Knock knock.
471,"00:29:18,730","00:29:20,556","- Hi.
- Hi."
472,"00:29:20,600","00:29:22,687","You're probably goin'
out of town for break,"
473,"00:29:22,730","00:29:25,425","so just wanna say happy holidays,
and a happy birthday."
474,"00:29:25,469","00:29:28,164","- It's your birthday, right?
- Tomorrow."
475,"00:29:28,208","00:29:30,338",I made you something.
476,"00:29:32,730","00:29:34,556",What's... What's this?
477,"00:29:34,600","00:29:37,904","It is a cost analysis
breakdown"
478,"00:29:37,948","00:29:39,687","of your weekly Uber
expenditure"
479,"00:29:39,730","00:29:42,121",versus owning a used car.
480,"00:29:42,687","00:29:44,643",Okay...
481,"00:29:44,687","00:29:48,121","I know. It's just,
turns out you're wasting a lot of money."
482,"00:29:48,164","00:29:51,861","I did a little research,
and I found a 2013 Toyota Corolla,"
483,"00:29:51,904","00:29:53,861","in town,
in excellent condition."
484,"00:29:53,904","00:29:56,774","I went down to the dealership,
negotiated terms,"
485,"00:29:56,817","00:30:00,425","and you'd put no money down,
you only pay 150 bucks a month."
486,"00:30:00,469","00:30:03,338","Vance also agreed to put your
auto insurance on company policy,"
487,"00:30:03,382","00:30:04,861",so that's free.
488,"00:30:04,904","00:30:06,687","This is, of course,
if you want to do it."
489,"00:30:06,730","00:30:07,730","I just like
crunching numbers..."
490,"00:30:07,774","00:30:09,208","Oh, my God!"
491,"00:30:09,251","00:30:11,251","- I take it you...
- Oh, my God! Mwah!"
492,"00:30:11,295","00:30:13,425",Thank you.
493,"00:30:16,164","00:30:17,991","Bye, Tessa."
494,"00:30:22,991","00:30:25,556","So, what do you think?"
495,"00:30:25,600","00:30:27,643","Well, you know,"
496,"00:30:27,687","00:30:29,208","it's, uh..."
497,"00:30:29,251","00:30:30,948",it's very Tessa.
498,"00:30:30,991","00:30:32,904","I will take that
as a compliment."
499,"00:30:32,948","00:30:35,078",I'm right up there.
500,"00:30:38,382","00:30:40,295",How's Dakota?
501,"00:30:40,338","00:30:43,295","Um, I'm actually looking
at your birthday horoscope."
502,"00:30:43,338","00:30:47,208","So first off,you share a birthday with..."
503,"00:30:47,251","00:30:49,600","- Joseph Stalin.
- Great."
504,"00:30:50,469","00:30:53,991","- You are a proud,
idealistic person... Like Stalin."
505,"00:30:54,035","00:30:57,208",You are more emotional than is obvious.
506,"00:30:57,251","00:31:01,164",You may solidify a romantic relationship
507,"00:31:01,208","00:31:05,469",or become involved with a mature partner.
508,"00:31:05,512","00:31:07,643","Mature.
That doesn't really sound..."
509,"00:31:07,687","00:31:09,904","No, it doesn't."
510,"00:31:09,948","00:31:11,469",He left for London.
511,"00:31:11,512","00:31:13,774",Have you heard from him?
512,"00:31:14,295","00:31:16,512","I haven't,
because I blocked him."
513,"00:31:16,556","00:31:18,643",That'll work.
514,"00:31:20,600","00:31:22,687",Bye.
515,"00:31:59,556","00:32:03,164",Whose place is this?
516,"00:33:22,121","00:33:24,295","""You can draw me to fire,"
517,"00:33:24,338","00:33:26,251","""you can draw me to water."
518,"00:33:26,295","00:33:28,687","""You can draw me
to the gallows,"
519,"00:33:28,730","00:33:31,469","you can draw me
to any death."""
520,"00:34:04,904","00:34:07,730","Well, here we are.
I could run you a bath"
521,"00:34:07,774","00:34:09,382","if you'd like to get
more comfortable."
522,"00:34:09,425","00:34:11,208",I would love that.
523,"00:34:11,251","00:34:16,208","I remember when you and I
used to take baths together."
524,"00:34:17,687","00:34:19,600","Oh, my goodness! Tessa?"
525,"00:34:19,643","00:34:21,687","- Tessa.
- Hardin's mother."
526,"00:34:21,730","00:34:23,164","Hardin said you were
gonna be out of town,"
527,"00:34:23,208","00:34:25,035","I didn't think
I was gonna meet you!"
528,"00:34:25,078","00:34:26,643","- Yeah.
- My God,"
529,"00:34:26,687","00:34:28,643","I cannot believe
how pretty you are."
530,"00:34:28,687","00:34:30,469","I mean, Hardin said you were
the most beautiful girl in the world,"
531,"00:34:30,512","00:34:33,643","but honestly, I thought you
were gonna be covered in tattoos,"
532,"00:34:33,687","00:34:35,600","green hair,
and a piercing on your bean."
533,"00:34:35,643","00:34:37,035","- What bean?
- Mum."
534,"00:34:37,078","00:34:38,643","Don't be so melodramatic,
Hardin."
535,"00:34:38,687","00:34:40,295","You and I are gonna
be the best of friends."
536,"00:34:40,338","00:34:41,774","Do you mind
if I use the loo?"
537,"00:34:41,817","00:34:43,512","Yeah, of course.
It's just, um..."
538,"00:34:43,556","00:34:45,643","Oh, look at you!"
539,"00:34:47,512","00:34:49,556","- Why are you here?
- I came to get the rest of my stuff."
540,"00:34:49,600","00:34:51,295","- You were supposed to be in London.
- I know."
541,"00:34:51,338","00:34:52,991","I didn't want to go without you,
so she came here."
542,"00:34:53,035","00:34:54,948",Why didn't you tell her that we broke up?
543,"00:34:54,991","00:34:56,991","She was so excited
when I told her first,"
544,"00:34:57,035","00:34:58,600","- I couldn't ruin it for her.
- Hardin!"
545,"00:34:58,643","00:35:00,208","She's my mum!
I couldn't tell her"
546,"00:35:00,251","00:35:02,338","about the stupid bet, okay?
I'm sorry."
547,"00:35:02,382","00:35:06,730","I don't expect youto
pretend we're still together."
548,"00:35:06,774","00:35:09,208","- It's fine.
- What's fine?"
549,"00:35:09,251","00:35:12,425","I said it's fine.
I'll play along."
550,"00:35:12,469","00:35:14,643","Thank you, Tessa.
Thank you so much."
551,"00:35:14,687","00:35:16,338",Thanks for the Kindle.
552,"00:35:16,382","00:35:18,556",Fuck! Happy birthday!
553,"00:35:18,904","00:35:20,948","- Is it your birthday?
- Yeah, it is."
554,"00:35:20,991","00:35:22,817","Why are we not
celebrating?"
555,"00:35:22,861","00:35:25,817","'Cause I... I was just about
to head out of town."
556,"00:35:25,861","00:35:28,338","- No!
- Yeah, I'm gonna see my mom."
557,"00:35:28,382","00:35:32,948","Can I be selfish and ask
you to stay another night?"
558,"00:35:33,556","00:35:36,469","Well, my mom's sort of expec..."
559,"00:35:36,512","00:35:39,687","We don't know when we're
gonna see each other again."
560,"00:35:39,730","00:35:42,730","Yeah. I, uh, I...
I guess I can leave tomorrow."
561,"00:35:42,774","00:35:44,904","Brilliant, brilliant,
brilliant."
562,"00:35:44,948","00:35:48,861","I am gonna whip you up a homemade
birthday cake that is gonna blow your mind."
563,"00:35:48,904","00:35:50,338",Cool.
564,"00:35:50,382","00:35:51,817",Cool.
565,"00:35:58,338","00:36:00,251","I know I'm biased 'cause I'm his mum,"
566,"00:36:00,295","00:36:03,121","but isn't that just the cutest
little bum you've ever seen?"
567,"00:36:03,164","00:36:04,817","- Oh, my God, Mum, please."
568,"00:36:04,861","00:36:06,730","- Hush.
- It's a pretty cute bum,"
569,"00:36:06,774","00:36:08,730",- Hardin.
570,"00:36:08,774","00:36:10,121","Right. Well, uh,"
571,"00:36:10,164","00:36:11,861","you guys are obviously having lots of fun,"
572,"00:36:11,904","00:36:14,295","so I'm just
gonna clear up,"
573,"00:36:14,338","00:36:17,469","and then...
set myself on fire."
574,"00:36:17,512","00:36:19,991","So Hardin tells me you're
an English majora s well."
575,"00:36:20,035","00:36:23,643","Mm-hmm. I'm in the process
of switching from econ."
576,"00:36:23,687","00:36:27,817","I actually just got an
internship at Vance Publishing."
577,"00:36:27,861","00:36:29,991","Vance, as in...
Christian Vance?"
578,"00:36:30,035","00:36:32,164",Mm-hmm.
579,"00:36:33,600","00:36:36,164","Hardin and I stayed
with Vance for a few years"
580,"00:36:36,208","00:36:37,817",when Ken and I broke up.
581,"00:36:37,861","00:36:39,991","- Really?
- Yeah."
582,"00:36:40,904","00:36:42,469","Hardin never
mentioned that."
583,"00:36:42,512","00:36:43,861",Never mentioned what?
584,"00:36:43,904","00:36:46,556","Nothing, darling.
Just girl talk."
585,"00:37:15,164","00:37:18,382","I'm just gonna grab a
blanket and sleep on the floor."
586,"00:37:18,425","00:37:22,600","You don't think we could
share the bed and not..."
587,"00:37:22,643","00:37:24,861","- You know.
- Do you?"
588,"00:37:24,904","00:37:26,730","Well, I'd like to think"
589,"00:37:26,774","00:37:30,164","that we're not
total Neanderthals."
590,"00:37:30,687","00:37:32,817",Okay.
591,"00:37:39,035","00:37:40,861",G'night.
592,"00:37:40,904","00:37:43,035",Good night.
593,"00:37:51,469","00:37:53,600",Um...
594,"00:37:54,469","00:37:57,774","I'm gonna leave
early in the morning"
595,"00:37:58,295","00:38:00,469",to... to head out of town.
596,"00:38:04,774","00:38:06,904",Okay.
597,"00:38:08,121","00:38:11,078","Thank you
for staying tonight."
598,"00:38:12,295","00:38:14,469",Thanks for having me.
599,"00:38:21,121","00:38:22,556",Sorry.
600,"00:38:22,600","00:38:25,208","No. No, it's...
That's okay."
601,"00:38:40,991","00:38:43,078",That feels nice.
602,"00:38:43,991","00:38:46,121","- Does it?
- Mm-hmm."
603,"00:39:02,295","00:39:05,295","- Did you have a nice birthday?
- Yeah, I did."
604,"00:39:05,338","00:39:08,948","And thank you again
for the... gift,"
605,"00:39:08,991","00:39:10,469",it was really thoughtful.
606,"00:39:10,512","00:39:13,295","I found it when I was
getting my stuff."
607,"00:39:13,338","00:39:15,425",I'm glad you like it.
608,"00:39:16,251","00:39:18,861",I love it.
609,"00:39:27,817","00:39:29,904",I got a car.
610,"00:39:30,425","00:39:32,687","- You got a car?
- Mm-hmm."
611,"00:39:33,512","00:39:35,600",What car did you get?
612,"00:39:39,338","00:39:41,469",A white one.
613,"00:39:43,469","00:39:45,600","Well, happy birthday."
614,"00:39:48,208","00:39:50,338",Night.
615,"00:39:54,295","00:39:56,425",Good night.
616,"00:40:00,512","00:40:02,991","- Good night.
- Good night."
617,"00:40:04,861","00:40:06,991",Good night.
618,"00:40:18,512","00:40:20,600","- Hardin.
- Huh?"
619,"00:40:21,121","00:40:23,251",This isn't working.
620,"00:40:24,600","00:40:26,687",Why? What's wrong?
621,"00:40:28,035","00:40:30,164",Feel.
622,"00:40:34,078","00:40:36,208",- Oh.
623,"00:40:39,730","00:40:41,861",You?
624,"00:40:46,164","00:40:48,295",Oh.
625,"00:41:07,035","00:41:09,338","Hardin, we should stop."
626,"00:41:10,035","00:41:12,164",Okay.
627,"00:41:12,469","00:41:13,643","Three seconds
and we'll stop."
628,"00:41:13,687","00:41:15,774","- Mm.
- Mm-hmm."
629,"00:41:17,774","00:41:20,121","- Three...
- Three..."
630,"00:41:20,164","00:41:22,251","- two...
- two..."
631,"00:41:22,904","00:41:24,991","- one.
- one."
632,"00:41:32,600","00:41:34,861","- Okay, ten more seconds.
- Okay."
633,"00:41:34,904","00:41:36,687","- And then we'll stop.
- Okay."
634,"00:41:36,730","00:41:38,861","- Yeah?
- Yeah."
635,"00:41:43,208","00:41:46,643","Will you apologize to your mum
for us kidnapping you last night?"
636,"00:41:46,687","00:41:48,774",I will.
637,"00:41:50,338","00:41:53,904","I can't tell you how much it
means to me to see Hardin this way."
638,"00:41:53,948","00:41:56,121",What way?
639,"00:41:56,164","00:41:58,295",Happy.
640,"00:42:00,512","00:42:01,643",What?
641,"00:42:04,295","00:42:06,425","- Bye.
- Bye."
642,"00:42:33,078","00:42:35,208",Nice wheels!
643,"00:42:35,687","00:42:38,078","- Vroom vroom!
- Noah, hi!"
644,"00:42:38,121","00:42:39,512","- Hi!
- It's good to see you!"
645,"00:42:39,556","00:42:40,817",Good to see you too.
646,"00:42:40,861","00:42:42,251",Mmm.
647,"00:42:42,295","00:42:44,425",Okay...
648,"00:42:45,295","00:42:47,991","Your mom told methat you were comin'
home today,so I figured I'd come greet you."
649,"00:42:48,035","00:42:49,948","Did she have you
on speed dial"
650,"00:42:49,991","00:42:51,774","the second I crossed
the county line?"
651,"00:42:51,817","00:42:53,295","I mean,
can you blame her?"
652,"00:42:53,338","00:42:55,121","She knows a good thing
when she sees it."
653,"00:42:55,164","00:42:56,643","- Right.
- Right."
654,"00:42:56,687","00:42:58,556","Um, how's senior year?"
655,"00:42:58,600","00:43:01,164","You know me,
breakin' hearts and takin' names."
656,"00:43:01,208","00:43:03,687","- That's you.
- Yeah? Yeah."
657,"00:43:04,078","00:43:06,295",Your mom told me about the internship.
658,"00:43:06,338","00:43:08,643","- That's really awesome.
- Thanks. Yeah."
659,"00:43:08,687","00:43:10,991","And everything's cool with
the whole thing with your dad."
660,"00:43:11,035","00:43:12,904",- What whole thing with my dad?- What?
661,"00:43:12,948","00:43:14,600",N-Nothing. Nothing.
662,"00:43:14,643","00:43:17,512","- What do you mean, nothing?
- I-I don't know."
663,"00:43:17,556","00:43:20,164","- I thought that she would
have... - Thought she what?"
664,"00:43:20,208","00:43:22,817",- Uh...
665,"00:43:23,643","00:43:25,425",- Are you kidding?
666,"00:43:25,469","00:43:27,948","- Why is she calling you?
- I'm sorry, Tess."
667,"00:43:27,991","00:43:29,730","Sorry,
I got stuck at work."
668,"00:43:29,774","00:43:31,469","- Is she there yet?
- Mom?"
669,"00:43:31,512","00:43:33,643","- Carol, she knows!
- Knows what?!"
670,"00:43:33,687","00:43:35,208",Oh! Tessa's with you.
671,"00:43:35,251","00:43:36,643","I hope I'm not interrupting
anything."
672,"00:43:36,687","00:43:38,035",What is going on with Dad?!
673,"00:43:38,078","00:43:40,164","Okay, that was rude."
674,"00:43:41,035","00:43:42,643",I'm just asking you about Dad.
675,"00:43:42,687","00:43:43,991",Fine.
676,"00:43:44,035","00:43:45,600","Your father wanted to see you,"
677,"00:43:45,643","00:43:47,730",but I chased him off.
678,"00:43:47,774","00:43:49,643","Why are you getting
so worked up about this?"
679,"00:43:49,687","00:43:51,600",I'm not getting worked up!
680,"00:43:51,643","00:43:53,643","I just don't understand why
you'd keep that a secret."
681,"00:43:53,687","00:43:57,208","And you never kept
any secrets from me?"
682,"00:43:57,251","00:44:00,382","Because I can think of
a big one, and so can Noah."
683,"00:44:00,425","00:44:02,425","I thought we got past
this little hiccup"
684,"00:44:02,469","00:44:04,382",once you got your heart broken.
685,"00:44:04,425","00:44:06,251","But I can tell by
the sound of your voice"
686,"00:44:06,295","00:44:07,948",that this not the case.
687,"00:44:07,991","00:44:10,382","This boy is not good for you,
Teresa."
688,"00:44:10,425","00:44:13,078","- He is just like your father.
- I'm hanging up."
689,"00:44:13,121","00:44:16,251","- No! Don't you fucking hang up on me!
- This was a mistake."
690,"00:44:16,295","00:44:18,425",Theresa? Theresa?
691,"00:44:19,425","00:44:20,948",- I blew it.
692,"00:44:20,991","00:44:22,687","I blew it, Carol.
I don't know what happened."
693,"00:44:52,469","00:44:54,425",Mummy?
694,"00:45:04,556","00:45:05,687",No!
695,"00:45:05,730","00:45:06,904",Mummy?
696,"00:45:06,948","00:45:09,948","Hardin, get back upstairs now!"
697,"00:45:11,687","00:45:13,338","Hey. Hey, I'm right here."
698,"00:45:13,382","00:45:15,512",Hey. Hey.
699,"00:45:17,164","00:45:18,991","Hey, it's okay. It's okay."
700,"00:45:20,338","00:45:22,600",It was just a nightmare.
701,"00:45:34,861","00:45:36,251",Morning.
702,"00:45:36,295","00:45:39,425","There... um,
there's tea.I... Help yourself."
703,"00:45:39,469","00:45:41,600",Thanks.
704,"00:45:42,382","00:45:44,208",Is he okay?
705,"00:45:44,251","00:45:46,556","- Hmm?
- The nightmares."
706,"00:45:46,861","00:45:48,948",I heard him last night.
707,"00:45:48,991","00:45:51,121","Um, he's sleeping now."
708,"00:45:53,425","00:45:56,469","How long have they
been going on?"
709,"00:45:57,730","00:46:00,382","Uh, ever since he was eight."
710,"00:46:01,991","00:46:04,121","Um, he, uh, well..."
711,"00:46:05,600","00:46:07,904",He told me...
712,"00:46:07,948","00:46:09,817","about that night
and what he saw."
713,"00:46:09,861","00:46:11,991",The assault.
714,"00:46:12,817","00:46:16,512","Whoa. He's never
told anyone that before."
715,"00:46:18,469","00:46:21,078","I'm so sorry for
what happened to you."
716,"00:46:21,121","00:46:24,948",I just hoped he'd forget the whole thing.
717,"00:46:27,600","00:46:31,512",But the nightmares kicked in.
718,"00:46:31,556","00:46:33,861",Sorry.
719,"00:46:33,904","00:46:36,251","And I took him to
therapist after the rapist,"
720,"00:46:36,295","00:46:38,512",but nothing seemed to help.
721,"00:46:38,556","00:46:42,861","And then he started
self-medicating with alcohol."
722,"00:46:42,904","00:46:45,035","But, um..."
723,"00:46:47,469","00:46:51,035",...he told me that the nightmares went away
724,"00:46:51,078","00:46:53,078",when he started seeing you.
725,"00:46:55,643","00:46:57,730",I didn't know that.
726,"00:47:01,338","00:47:02,991",May I ask...
727,"00:47:03,035","00:47:05,512","why does your mum
hate him so much?"
728,"00:47:05,556","00:47:07,774","Um, Hardin's your son..."
729,"00:47:08,556","00:47:10,600","Yes, and I love him,"
730,"00:47:11,208","00:47:14,512",but he is not without his challenges.
731,"00:47:14,556","00:47:18,904","You can tell me.What
happened between you two?"
732,"00:47:21,251","00:47:23,382",He lied to me.
733,"00:47:24,164","00:47:26,600","- A big lie?
- A massive lie."
734,"00:47:27,730","00:47:29,861",Is he sorry?
735,"00:47:31,730","00:47:33,425",He is.
736,"00:47:33,469","00:47:36,817","What are you two
gabbing on about?"
737,"00:47:36,861","00:47:38,861",Make sure you brush your teeth.
738,"00:47:38,904","00:47:41,991","He used to give me such a
hard time about brushing his teeth."
739,"00:47:42,035","00:47:43,643","Mum, for the love of God,"
740,"00:47:43,687","00:47:45,512","of course I'm gonna
brush my teeth."
741,"00:47:45,556","00:47:47,643",Great. Morning!
742,"00:47:47,687","00:47:50,687",- Morning. Thank you.
743,"00:47:51,512","00:47:53,600",I love your mom.
744,"00:47:54,164","00:47:56,295",She's all right.
745,"00:47:59,035","00:48:01,164",Happy belated.
746,"00:48:01,817","00:48:04,121","But you already
got me a gift."
747,"00:48:04,164","00:48:06,164","True, but you
had to snoop around"
748,"00:48:06,208","00:48:08,121","and open it without me,
thus denying me"
749,"00:48:08,164","00:48:11,121","the pleasure of watching
you react to said gift."
750,"00:48:11,164","00:48:13,295",Therefore...
751,"00:48:14,382","00:48:16,512","""Tessa's perfect day."""
752,"00:48:17,904","00:48:19,991",What's my perfect day?
753,"00:48:20,035","00:48:21,948","Well, that's for you to decide."
754,"00:48:21,991","00:48:24,208","Whatever your wish or desire,"
755,"00:48:24,251","00:48:28,991","I will agree to without any
snide remarks or tantrums."
756,"00:48:29,035","00:48:32,425","Your time starts in three,
two, one."
757,"00:48:34,382","00:48:36,425",Isn't this nice?
758,"00:48:36,469","00:48:39,643","I always wanted
to go ice skating."
759,"00:48:39,687","00:48:42,295","Yeah, it's... great.
I'm loving..."
760,"00:48:42,338","00:48:44,512",Unhh! Unh...
761,"00:48:44,556","00:48:46,600","- Are you okay?
- Yeah."
762,"00:48:46,643","00:48:48,208",Just a tad rusty.
763,"00:48:48,251","00:48:49,991","When was the last time
you skated?"
764,"00:48:50,035","00:48:52,338",I've never skated before.
765,"00:48:52,382","00:48:53,904","Do you want me
to get you a walker?"
766,"00:48:53,948","00:48:56,164",You're doing great.
767,"00:48:56,208","00:48:58,512",Fuck no!
768,"00:48:58,556","00:49:02,208","- Are you... Oh, it's okay.
It's... it's okay."
769,"00:49:02,251","00:49:04,382",Whoo.
770,"00:49:05,078","00:49:07,164","- Are you okay?
- Yup."
771,"00:49:07,600","00:49:09,687",Do you want to stop?
772,"00:49:09,991","00:49:12,295","No.
We're here to have..."
773,"00:49:13,251","00:49:16,208",- Unhh! Aaah!
774,"00:49:16,251","00:49:18,991",Hardin?I have a better idea.
775,"00:49:19,035","00:49:21,469","Stretch out into
Child's Pose,"
776,"00:49:21,512","00:49:25,556","and let the day's
tension just melt away."
777,"00:49:25,600","00:49:27,991","It's not the pose melting
this tension away,"
778,"00:49:28,035","00:49:30,035","- it's the fucking heat.
- Shh!"
779,"00:49:30,078","00:49:32,687","- Is there any air-conditioning?
- It's hot yoga."
780,"00:49:32,730","00:49:35,774","From Child's Pose,lift,
and slowly press back"
781,"00:49:35,817","00:49:38,861",into your Downward Facing Dog.
782,"00:49:38,904","00:49:40,469",Did anyone ever tell you
783,"00:49:40,512","00:49:42,991",you have the most amazing bum?
784,"00:49:43,035","00:49:44,687",Stop.
785,"00:49:44,730","00:49:47,687","...and slowly move into
salamba sarvangasana."
786,"00:49:47,730","00:49:50,382","Excuse me,is this beginner's yoga?"
787,"00:49:50,425","00:49:54,469","That was at ten-thirty.
This is acro-yoga."
788,"00:49:56,035","00:50:00,078","...and then lift them up
and towards the ceiling."
789,"00:50:00,121","00:50:02,251",Breathe together.
790,"00:50:05,078","00:50:08,251","Inhale, lift your arms overhead."
791,"00:50:10,208","00:50:12,904","And as you exhale,
lean forward."
792,"00:50:12,948","00:50:17,121","- Allow your partner's weight
to lean into you."
793,"00:50:17,164","00:50:19,730","Slowly breathe and
open your legs and..."
794,"00:50:19,774","00:50:21,904",wider... inhale...
795,"00:50:23,425","00:50:25,035",a little wider...
796,"00:50:25,078","00:50:28,774","and if you can,
put your legs even wider."
797,"00:50:35,643","00:50:38,643","Is yoga supposed
to be a turn-on?"
798,"00:50:41,208","00:50:43,556",Are you turned on?
799,"00:50:43,600","00:50:44,991",Mm-hmm.
800,"00:50:45,035","00:50:46,948","- Can we leave then?
- Mm-hmm."
801,"00:50:46,991","00:50:50,121","- Now? Let's go.
- Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm."
802,"00:50:50,948","00:50:53,078",Sweaty! I am sweaty!
803,"00:50:53,469","00:50:56,251","Wait! Just give me
five minutes, okay?"
804,"00:50:56,295","00:50:59,078",I just need to get...
805,"00:51:04,295","00:51:06,425","Oh, my God. Hardin."
806,"00:51:09,861","00:51:13,817",- Let's get these off.
807,"00:51:17,730","00:51:19,600","Okay, we're getting somewhere!"
808,"00:51:57,295","00:51:59,382","- Oh, shit!"
809,"00:52:55,687","00:52:57,991","It's my boss,
I have to get this."
810,"00:52:58,035","00:53:00,164",Are you serious?
811,"00:53:00,730","00:53:03,425","Hi! Kimberly,what's wrong?"
812,"00:53:05,382","00:53:07,556","Oh, no. How can we help?"
813,"00:53:08,164","00:53:09,338",Hmm.
814,"00:53:09,382","00:53:10,643",Hi.
815,"00:53:10,687","00:53:13,078","You have no idea
how much of a lifesaver"
816,"00:53:13,121","00:53:14,338",the two of you are right now.
817,"00:53:14,382","00:53:15,904","God, poor Vance
caught this bug"
818,"00:53:15,948","00:53:17,991","and he's throwing up
everywhere."
819,"00:53:18,035","00:53:19,904",It's no problem.
820,"00:53:19,948","00:53:23,121","Okay, who are you and what
have you done with Hardin?"
821,"00:53:23,164","00:53:25,643","It's part of my birthday
present. I'll tell you later."
822,"00:53:25,687","00:53:28,338",Ohh! I'm running so late.
823,"00:53:28,382","00:53:32,078","I'll be back in a few hours,
okay? You're in good hands."
824,"00:53:32,121","00:53:34,948","- Bye.
- Thank you."
825,"00:53:38,035","00:53:40,164",Hi.
826,"00:53:40,208","00:53:44,164","Um, so,
we have the whole afternoon together."
827,"00:53:44,208","00:53:47,512","- Is there anything that you want to do?
- No."
828,"00:53:47,556","00:53:50,035","I could get us some markers
and we can draw!"
829,"00:53:50,078","00:53:51,817",I don't like to draw.
830,"00:53:51,861","00:53:53,991",No? Are you hungry?
831,"00:53:55,904","00:53:58,035",No.
832,"00:54:07,817","00:54:10,861","Wanna tell me
about your trains?"
833,"00:54:13,687","00:54:15,948","Okay, I don't want
to hear about them anyway."
834,"00:54:15,991","00:54:17,948","What are those marks
on your arm?"
835,"00:54:17,991","00:54:19,600",My tattoos.
836,"00:54:19,643","00:54:22,295","- Why do you have them?
- Because I like them."
837,"00:54:22,338","00:54:23,948","Don't people think
it looks strange?"
838,"00:54:23,991","00:54:25,861","I don't give a fuck
what people think."
839,"00:54:25,904","00:54:28,035",Which people don't you give a fuck about?
840,"00:54:28,078","00:54:30,425","- Oh, shit. Don't say fuck.
- Shit."
841,"00:54:30,469","00:54:32,164",Fuck. Shit.
842,"00:54:32,208","00:54:34,295",Fucky fuck. Shit...
843,"00:54:35,078","00:54:37,208","- Hey. So...
- Hi!"
844,"00:54:37,512","00:54:39,512","He is actually hungry now.
We need to get him some..."
845,"00:54:39,556","00:54:40,861",- Fuck. Shit.
846,"00:54:40,904","00:54:42,382","Uh, I can go if you want."
847,"00:54:42,425","00:54:44,078","- Or you could.
- No, it's fine."
848,"00:54:44,121","00:54:45,991","- I'll get us some sandwiches.
- Perfect."
849,"00:54:46,035","00:54:48,469","- Thank you so much.
- Whoo! Okay!"
850,"00:54:48,512","00:54:49,643","- See you later. Bye-bye.
- Okay, bye!"
851,"00:54:49,687","00:54:52,251",Shit. Fuck. Shit.
852,"00:54:54,730","00:54:56,861",Go ahead.
853,"00:54:59,251","00:55:01,730","Here,
I can take those now."
854,"00:55:02,078","00:55:04,556","You know, she really
brings out the best in you."
855,"00:55:04,600","00:55:06,948",Is it that obvious?
856,"00:55:06,991","00:55:08,948",Have a nice holiday.
857,"00:55:08,991","00:55:11,121",You too.
858,"00:55:12,643","00:55:13,817","See ya, mate."
859,"00:55:13,861","00:55:15,991","See ya, mate."
860,"00:55:22,600","00:55:24,164",You ready?
861,"00:55:24,208","00:55:27,295","Yeah. Uh, we're
the last ones here,"
862,"00:55:27,338","00:55:29,643","so I just have
to set the alarm."
863,"00:55:29,687","00:55:31,774",Merry Christmas.
864,"00:55:33,687","00:55:36,164",Christmas is next week.
865,"00:55:38,164","00:55:41,861","I've never been one
to follow the rules."
866,"00:55:48,295","00:55:50,425","It says ""Whatever our souls
are made of..."""
867,"00:55:50,469","00:55:53,078","""His and mine are the same."""
868,"00:55:57,121","00:55:59,251",What's wrong?
869,"00:56:02,861","00:56:08,338","I didn't think that I'd see you over the
holidays, so I didn't get you anything."
870,"00:56:08,382","00:56:11,208","Is there anything
that you want?"
871,"00:56:13,991","00:56:16,035",Another chance?
872,"00:56:18,904","00:56:21,469","Do you promise to
act like this every day?"
873,"00:56:21,512","00:56:23,600",No.
874,"00:56:25,991","00:56:28,121",But I'll try.
875,"00:56:35,817","00:56:37,948",Whatever it takes.
876,"00:57:05,469","00:57:08,295","We can't do this here.
What if someone comes in?"
877,"00:57:08,338","00:57:11,512","Helloooo?
Anyone here?"
878,"00:57:11,991","00:57:13,991",Anyone?!
879,"00:57:14,035","00:57:18,730","You just have an answer
for everything, don't you?"
880,"00:57:32,121","00:57:33,817",It's fake.
881,"00:57:33,861","00:57:35,948",Shit.
882,"00:59:03,600","00:59:06,600","There's no one else
for me, Tessa."
883,"00:59:06,643","00:59:08,730",No one.
884,"00:59:12,774","00:59:14,904",I love you.
885,"00:59:15,295","00:59:17,948",I love you too.
886,"00:59:19,251","00:59:24,251","Don't say ""too."" Sounds
like you're agreeing with me."
887,"00:59:25,164","00:59:27,295","I love you, Hardin."
888,"00:59:59,643","01:00:01,121",Trish.
889,"01:00:01,164","01:00:02,382","Yeah, it's Ken."
890,"01:00:02,425","01:00:04,556",This is a surprise.
891,"01:00:04,600","01:00:07,600","So listen, um,
my wife Karen and I"
892,"01:00:08,948","01:00:12,556","are having people over for Christmas,
and..."
893,"01:00:12,600","01:00:15,991","we would love it if you and
Hardin and Tessa could join us."
894,"01:00:16,035","01:00:20,425","Well, I'm leaving for London today,
but, um..."
895,"01:00:20,469","01:00:22,643","the flight's not
until this evening,"
896,"01:00:22,687","01:00:24,861","so I think
we can pop over."
897,"01:00:24,904","01:00:26,643",It would mean the world to me.
898,"01:00:26,687","01:00:29,904","I guess we'll see you later,then."
899,"01:00:29,948","01:00:32,338","Merry Christmas, Trish."
900,"01:00:34,687","01:00:36,035","- Yeah?
- Yeah."
901,"01:00:36,078","01:00:37,208","- Yeah?
- Yeah."
902,"01:00:37,251","01:00:39,425",Oh! I'm so proud of you.
903,"01:00:39,991","01:00:42,078",Can't wait to meet her.
904,"01:01:05,687","01:01:07,774",This is his house?
905,"01:01:08,861","01:01:11,295","- I told you.
- For fuck's sake,"
906,"01:01:11,338","01:01:13,948","I didn't think
it was this big."
907,"01:01:13,991","01:01:15,948","Mum, we don't
have to do this."
908,"01:01:15,991","01:01:20,295","Look, the last time I saw
your dad was ten years ago."
909,"01:01:20,338","01:01:22,600",It's time. Come on.
910,"01:01:26,774","01:01:28,600","- Hi. Karen?
- Yes, hi."
911,"01:01:28,643","01:01:29,861",Thank you for having us.
912,"01:02:03,904","01:02:06,469","Well, come on.
Merry Christmas."
913,"01:02:24,643","01:02:27,643","This humble one,
right here now,"
914,"01:02:28,251","01:02:31,078","he just co-authored
a new interpretation"
915,"01:02:31,121","01:02:32,861",of Taming of the Shrew
916,"01:02:32,904","01:02:34,556","with the head of
the English department."
917,"01:02:34,600","01:02:36,817",It's not a big deal.
918,"01:02:36,861","01:02:38,600",- It is a big deal!
919,"01:02:48,208","01:02:49,687",...directed that to perfection.
920,"01:02:49,730","01:02:52,338","That third act
had me in tears."
921,"01:02:52,382","01:02:54,164",We saw it twice.
922,"01:03:24,687","01:03:26,469",Uber's gonna be here
923,"01:03:26,512","01:03:28,382","- in five minutes.
- Oh!"
924,"01:03:28,425","01:03:30,251","Well, I'm glad
you stopped by."
925,"01:03:30,295","01:03:31,904",Me too.
926,"01:03:31,948","01:03:33,861","Dinner should
be ready shortly."
927,"01:03:33,904","01:03:36,556","Okay, I hope everybody
has a hearty appetite."
928,"01:03:36,600","01:03:38,643","- Absolutely!
- Karen is a dynamite cook."
929,"01:03:38,687","01:03:40,600","Yes, she is."
930,"01:03:40,643","01:03:42,295",Where'd you go?
931,"01:03:42,338","01:03:43,948",Just for a walk.
932,"01:03:43,991","01:03:45,687","So Trish,
I hear that"
933,"01:03:45,730","01:03:47,208","this is your first time
in the States?"
934,"01:03:47,251","01:03:49,208","- Yeah, it is.
- And how do you like it?"
935,"01:03:49,251","01:03:51,382",There's a lot to see.
936,"01:03:51,425","01:03:54,512","It's kind of worn out its welcome,
if you ask me."
937,"01:03:54,556","01:03:57,643",Be happy to get back home once I graduate.
938,"01:03:57,687","01:04:00,469","You're moving back to England
after graduation?"
939,"01:04:00,512","01:04:02,600","Yeah, of course I am."
940,"01:04:02,904","01:04:05,730","Trish, can I get you another
glass before you leave us?"
941,"01:04:05,774","01:04:07,512","No. But it was
lovely. Thank you."
942,"01:04:07,556","01:04:09,035",I'm so glad you like it.
943,"01:04:09,078","01:04:10,730","We got it in Greece
on our honeymoon."
944,"01:04:10,774","01:04:12,948",I stuck to Pellegrino.
945,"01:04:12,991","01:04:16,164","We stayed in
this gorgeous villa."
946,"01:04:16,556","01:04:19,687","Did you know that
the beaches in Santorini"
947,"01:04:19,730","01:04:21,904","are made up of
volcanic pebbles,"
948,"01:04:21,948","01:04:25,121","so there's no sand
to make the water murky."
949,"01:04:25,164","01:04:27,425",So it is a crystal-clear...
950,"01:04:27,469","01:04:29,991","- What the fuck is wrong with you?
- Hardin."
951,"01:04:30,035","01:04:32,338","- Excuse me? Look
at your fucking trousers."
952,"01:04:32,382","01:04:33,861","I'm sorry, Mum,
but seriously,"
953,"01:04:33,904","01:04:35,643",do you have any sensitivity whatsoever?
954,"01:04:35,687","01:04:38,164",You're just boorishly droning on
955,"01:04:38,208","01:04:40,295",with no regard for the lives you destroyed.
956,"01:04:40,338","01:04:43,948","P-Perhaps we could find
a more private place"
957,"01:04:43,991","01:04:47,078","- to have this conversation.
- By all means."
958,"01:04:47,121","01:04:49,600",It's Bill Gates.
959,"01:04:51,164","01:04:53,817","Okay, well, you are obviously
quite upset with me,"
960,"01:04:53,861","01:04:56,338","so go ahead and say
what's on your mind."
961,"01:04:56,382","01:04:58,208","Why did you even
invite us here?"
962,"01:04:58,251","01:05:00,164","I invited you here
because you're my family."
963,"01:05:00,208","01:05:02,425",We're not your family.We were your family.
964,"01:05:02,469","01:05:04,991","- You ran out and reinvented... Hardin,
I thought we were past this."
965,"01:05:05,035","01:05:07,643","We didn't get past it. How
were we supposed to get past it?"
966,"01:05:07,687","01:05:09,991","You haven't owned up
to anything!"
967,"01:05:10,035","01:05:12,164","Your twelve steps...
making amends."
968,"01:05:12,208","01:05:15,078","Where's Mum's amends?Mum,
have you got your amends yet?"
969,"01:05:15,121","01:05:16,687","What would you
like me to do?"
970,"01:05:16,730","01:05:18,208","You don't think that
I am consumed by guilt?"
971,"01:05:18,251","01:05:20,730","I knew that night
that I had to go."
972,"01:05:20,774","01:05:22,991","No! After that night
you had to stay!"
973,"01:05:23,035","01:05:25,338","And you didn't! That night
happened becauseof you!"
974,"01:05:25,382","01:05:27,643","Yes! And I have been haunted
by it for the last ten years!"
975,"01:05:27,687","01:05:30,295","It haunts you?!
I fucking watched it happen,"
976,"01:05:30,338","01:05:33,164",- you bastard!
977,"01:05:38,556","01:05:40,687","I'm sorry, Mum."
978,"01:05:40,730","01:05:42,817",I had to.
979,"01:05:43,556","01:05:46,948","No, wait. You don't have to
get an Uber.I can give you a ride."
980,"01:05:46,991","01:05:49,382","After the shit
you've just pulled?"
981,"01:05:49,425","01:05:51,991","Not to mention
you're drunk."
982,"01:05:52,035","01:05:54,121","Look, I'm sorry
I'm not like you."
983,"01:05:54,164","01:05:56,991","You may be able to forget
everything he did, but I can't."
984,"01:05:57,035","01:05:59,556",I haven't forgotten anything.
985,"01:05:59,600","01:06:03,948","I've chosen to forgive him
so that I can move on."
986,"01:06:05,121","01:06:08,643","Hardin, resentments like this
are gonna destroy you."
987,"01:06:08,687","01:06:13,295","And they're gonna take Tessa
right down with you."
988,"01:06:46,035","01:06:48,469",- Fuck!
989,"01:07:14,600","01:07:17,035",- Hardin.
990,"01:07:19,643","01:07:21,687",Hardin.
991,"01:07:21,730","01:07:23,469",Hardin!
992,"01:08:03,121","01:08:05,251","Hold that, please!"
993,"01:08:06,251","01:08:08,382",Oh.
994,"01:08:10,512","01:08:14,643","And I thought I was the only Grinch
who worked the day after Christmas."
995,"01:08:14,687","01:08:17,338","We have gotta stop
meeting like this."
996,"01:08:17,382","01:08:21,469","You're right. I'll have restraining
orders drafted immediately."
997,"01:08:21,512","01:08:23,121",How was your Christmas?
998,"01:08:23,164","01:08:25,295",Uneventful. Yours?
999,"01:08:25,991","01:08:28,121",Eventful.
1000,"01:08:28,425","01:08:30,904",That's a loaded response.
1001,"01:08:33,600","01:08:36,338","Well, I'd love to hear more
about your eventful Christmas,"
1002,"01:08:36,382","01:08:38,078",so... lunch?
1003,"01:08:38,121","01:08:39,512",Postmates. I'm buying.
1004,"01:08:39,556","01:08:41,512",How could I refuse?
1005,"01:08:41,556","01:08:44,035","Great. I'll email you
some menus."
1006,"01:08:44,078","01:08:46,904","I know,
very chivalrous of me."
1007,"01:08:50,556","01:08:55,251","I thought that things were
getting better, but..."
1008,"01:08:55,295","01:08:59,164","it's clear that he still has a
lot of stuff he has to deal with."
1009,"01:08:59,208","01:09:02,382","And I just feel
really bad for him..."
1010,"01:09:02,425","01:09:04,904","and I don't know
how to fix it."
1011,"01:09:04,948","01:09:07,338","Well, let me ask you this."
1012,"01:09:08,382","01:09:10,643",Are you in love with him?
1013,"01:09:11,600","01:09:14,991","- I am.
- Then you got yourself a problem."
1014,"01:09:17,035","01:09:18,817","Those are your
words of wisdom?"
1015,"01:09:18,861","01:09:21,338","Hey, I never said I had
any words of wisdom."
1016,"01:09:21,382","01:09:26,730","No, you just wanted to know
whether I actually loved him."
1017,"01:09:26,774","01:09:29,164",I should get back to work.
1018,"01:09:30,643","01:09:33,251","Thank you for lunch.
Next time it's on me."
1019,"01:09:33,295","01:09:36,643",I don't think there's gonna be a next time.
1020,"01:09:36,687","01:09:38,035",Ouch.
1021,"01:09:38,078","01:09:40,687","No, not like that,
believe me."
1022,"01:09:40,730","01:09:42,600",I'm moving to Seattle.
1023,"01:09:42,643","01:09:45,512","Vance offered me the Head of
Finance position at the new office."
1024,"01:09:45,556","01:09:47,382","Oh, my God.
Trevor, that's amazing."
1025,"01:09:47,425","01:09:49,338",Thanks.
1026,"01:09:49,382","01:09:51,556","Well, ya know,
I don't leave tomorrow."
1027,"01:09:51,600","01:09:53,295",We could still... that's...
1028,"01:09:53,338","01:09:56,035","No, that's stupid."
1029,"01:10:04,295","01:10:06,425",Tessa.
1030,"01:10:07,338","01:10:12,600","My sister has struggled
with addiction her whole life."
1031,"01:10:12,643","01:10:14,687","This thing between
you and Hardin..."
1032,"01:10:14,730","01:10:17,035",it's not gonna end well.
1033,"01:10:20,687","01:10:22,774","Well, you're wrong."
1034,"01:11:00,035","01:11:02,556","This one's better
anyway."
1035,"01:11:15,469","01:11:19,512","You're never gonna show me
what you're writing in there,are you?"
1036,"01:11:19,556","01:11:21,643",Maybe... someday.
1037,"01:11:29,208","01:11:31,121",You don't wanna see who that is?
1038,"01:11:31,164","01:11:33,295",I know who it is.
1039,"01:11:33,338","01:11:34,817",It's Steph.
1040,"01:11:34,861","01:11:39,121","The frat house is having
a New Year's Eve party."
1041,"01:11:39,164","01:11:41,295",Right.
1042,"01:11:41,600","01:11:43,164",Do you wanna go?
1043,"01:11:43,208","01:11:46,774","No. I don't wanna
leave you here alone."
1044,"01:11:47,643","01:11:49,774",I wouldn't be alone.
1045,"01:11:49,817","01:11:51,948",I'd go with you.
1046,"01:11:53,512","01:11:56,382","Sorry, I... I just thought
after everything that happened"
1047,"01:11:56,425","01:11:58,208","- that you wouldn't want to...
- I'm not scared of them."
1048,"01:11:58,251","01:12:00,469","Besides, if it
blows up in my face,"
1049,"01:12:00,512","01:12:03,643","then we can just
stay in next year."
1050,"01:12:13,251","01:12:15,382",What was that for?
1051,"01:12:18,164","01:12:21,643","I just loved
how you said ""next year."""
1052,"01:12:27,600","01:12:28,991",Hello?
1053,"01:12:29,035","01:12:30,556","Tessa, why aren't you
in the office?"
1054,"01:12:30,600","01:12:32,164","Well, yeah, I...
I thought it was..."
1055,"01:12:32,208","01:12:33,643","I'm kidding.
Happy New Year."
1056,"01:12:33,687","01:12:35,948",Yes!
1057,"01:12:35,991","01:12:37,643",You got me.
1058,"01:12:37,687","01:12:39,512",I'll cut to the chase.
1059,"01:12:39,556","01:12:41,469","We went with the manuscript
you recommended,"
1060,"01:12:41,512","01:12:43,556","and it sold today
in quite a bidding war."
1061,"01:12:43,600","01:12:46,425","Wow, that's...
that's fantastic."
1062,"01:12:46,469","01:12:48,164","Listen, we were
gonna hire someone"
1063,"01:12:48,208","01:12:49,817","to do digital submissions
in Seattle, but..."
1064,"01:12:49,861","01:12:52,382","you're better than anyone
I've interviewed."
1065,"01:12:52,425","01:12:54,643","I'll take care of your tuition,
living expenses, provided you transfer."
1066,"01:12:54,687","01:12:58,556","Obviously, Hardin's welcome
to join you."
1067,"01:12:58,600","01:12:59,687","Wow, that..."
1068,"01:12:59,730","01:13:02,687","uh, that sounds
really amazing."
1069,"01:13:03,904","01:13:07,295","Um, can you give me a chance
to think about it, please?"
1070,"01:13:07,338","01:13:08,817",Of course. I just wanted
1071,"01:13:08,861","01:13:10,295",to share the good news.
1072,"01:13:10,338","01:13:12,164","Happy New Year, Tess."
1073,"01:13:12,208","01:13:14,338","Happy New Year, sir."
1074,"01:13:17,078","01:13:18,512",Hey.
1075,"01:13:18,556","01:13:20,556",Were you talking to me?
1076,"01:13:20,600","01:13:21,904",Nope.
1077,"01:13:21,948","01:13:24,251",What is taking so long?
1078,"01:13:24,295","01:13:25,904",Being a woman.
1079,"01:13:25,948","01:13:28,251","Now, can you go wait outside?"
1080,"01:13:28,295","01:13:30,425","- So sorry.
- Thanks."
1081,"01:13:40,208","01:13:42,338",Undefeated!
1082,"01:13:43,121","01:13:44,600",Fuck!
1083,"01:13:44,643","01:13:47,251","- It's okay.
- Sorry. Sorry."
1084,"01:13:49,991","01:13:51,643",We've missed you.
1085,"01:13:51,687","01:13:52,730",Are we good?
1086,"01:13:52,774","01:13:54,643",Ancient history.
1087,"01:13:54,687","01:13:56,078","You guys
wanna get in on this?"
1088,"01:13:56,121","01:13:57,425","Yeah, you can
take my place."
1089,"01:13:57,469","01:13:59,600",Go. I'll watch.
1090,"01:14:00,556","01:14:02,035",I like to watch.
1091,"01:14:02,078","01:14:04,295","Yeah, I bet you do."
1092,"01:14:04,338","01:14:06,425","Okay, sure."
1093,"01:14:06,817","01:14:08,164","You know what you're doing,right?"
1094,"01:14:08,208","01:14:10,251","- Not a clue.
- Awesome."
1095,"01:14:10,295","01:14:12,425",Great.
1096,"01:14:14,251","01:14:16,600",Tessa!
1097,"01:14:17,861","01:14:19,295",Mmm.
1098,"01:14:19,338","01:14:20,512",Mm.
1099,"01:14:20,556","01:14:21,687",What is that?
1100,"01:14:21,730","01:14:23,469",Cherry vodka sour.
1101,"01:14:23,512","01:14:25,600",Cool.
1102,"01:14:29,817","01:14:31,948",This is fun!
1103,"01:14:36,904","01:14:39,035","- Yes!
- Yes!"
1104,"01:14:44,469","01:14:47,469","Drink, bitch!"
1105,"01:14:47,512","01:14:49,600",Whoo! I like this!
1106,"01:14:49,643","01:14:52,382","- Nice job! One more!
- Aowww!"
1107,"01:15:01,251","01:15:03,600",I... suck at this.
1108,"01:15:04,948","01:15:07,078",Jamie. Hey.
1109,"01:15:09,643","01:15:11,687","- It is you.
- Hi."
1110,"01:15:12,164","01:15:13,991",Can I talk to you upstairs?
1111,"01:15:14,035","01:15:16,164",Lead the way.
1112,"01:15:29,991","01:15:32,121",Molly's here!
1113,"01:15:33,556","01:15:35,643",You fucking kidding me?
1114,"01:15:37,469","01:15:39,600",Fuck this.
1115,"01:15:43,121","01:15:45,512","So cool,
all those gears."
1116,"01:15:46,121","01:15:47,817",You're like a robot.
1117,"01:15:47,861","01:15:49,382",Who says I'm not?
1118,"01:15:49,425","01:15:51,948","I have a tattoo
of a little butterfly,"
1119,"01:15:51,991","01:15:54,817","but you can only see it
when I'm naked."
1120,"01:15:54,861","01:15:56,948","- I love butterflies.
- Really?"
1121,"01:15:56,991","01:15:59,078",Yeah.
1122,"01:16:05,121","01:16:07,817","Hey!
I was looking for you."
1123,"01:16:07,861","01:16:09,991",Hey. Let's leave.
1124,"01:16:10,469","01:16:12,600",Okay.
1125,"01:16:17,121","01:16:21,295","Aww. If it isn't the cute
couple together again."
1126,"01:16:21,338","01:16:23,512","Oh, yay. It's Molly."
1127,"01:16:23,556","01:16:25,295","- Where you guys going?
- We're going home."
1128,"01:16:25,338","01:16:28,208","Ohh. Lame. Come on,
it's almost New Year's."
1129,"01:16:28,251","01:16:30,991","- We just wanna be alone.
- Let's go."
1130,"01:16:31,035","01:16:34,643","Good. She never really
fit in, anyway."
1131,"01:16:36,121","01:16:37,556",One drink.
1132,"01:16:37,600","01:16:39,730",What... Tess.
1133,"01:16:46,251","01:16:50,208","Excuse me, lovebirds,
you're on my chair."
1134,"01:16:50,600","01:16:52,861","- Seriously?
- Yeah. Now, fuck off."
1135,"01:16:52,904","01:16:54,251",Move.

the answer to that,"
1155,"01:17:42,382","01:17:43,904",because Hardin fucked you.

you just call me?"
1162,"01:17:58,687","01:18:01,817","I didn't call you anything.
I just asked you a question."
1163,"01:18:01,861","01:18:03,687",Are you a whore?
1164,"01:18:03,730","01:18:05,774","- You are.
- You have to answer honestly,"
1165,"01:18:05,817","01:18:08,774","because it's called
Truth for a reason."
1166,"01:18:08,817","01:18:10,991",No.
1167,"01:18:11,035","01:18:12,295",Do they not like each other?

I never kiss and tell."

you don't get to cry!"
1238,"01:22:34,295","01:22:36,643","You just fucking kissed a guy
right in front of me!"
1239,"01:22:36,687","01:22:38,643","- And what did you do, huh?
- Nothing!"
1240,"01:22:38,687","01:22:40,512","- The fuck is wrong with you?!

and tell,you fucking liar!"
1242,"01:22:43,904","01:22:45,774",It's a figure of speech!

person for you! That's all I fucking do!"
1248,"01:23:01,512","01:23:04,774","Tell me what else I can do to
make you believe that I love you."

forgive me, are you?"
1256,"01:23:19,861","01:23:22,338","You're just gonna keep bringing it up,
every time."
1257,"01:23:22,382","01:23:24,861",Because I don't trust you!
1258,"01:23:25,251","01:23:28,600","You act like
you're so fucking innocent."
1259,"01:23:28,643","01:23:30,382",Like you're perfect.

you're bad news."
1305,"01:27:00,861","01:27:03,948","If you love Tessa, and I
think that you do, let her go."

1340,"01:29:25,338","01:29:28,643",- You have to call me.
1341,"01:29:28,687","01:29:31,687","We need to talk about this,
okay?"
1342,"01:29:31,730","01:29:34,643","- You can't disappear
for nine days. Call me."
1343,"01:29:34,687","01:29:36,861",- Call me.
1344,"01:29:46,469","01:29:48,295",- Tessa?!
1345,"01:29:48,338","01:29:49,600","Hardin, help me!"
1346,"01:29:56,208","01:29:58,338",- It's okay.
1347,"01:30:32,904","01:30:35,078",Thank you.
1348,"01:30:35,121","01:30:38,295","How are
the applications going?"
1349,"01:30:38,338","01:30:41,512","Fine. Dad said
he'd make some calls."
1350,"01:30:42,904","01:30:45,164",You two spoke?
1351,"01:30:45,208","01:30:47,338",How'd that go?
1352,"01:30:48,774","01:30:50,904",As well as it could.
1353,"01:30:52,295","01:30:54,600","Hardin, what happened
that night,"
1354,"01:30:54,643","01:30:56,208",it wasn't his fault.
1355,"01:30:56,251","01:30:58,556",And all the other nights?
1356,"01:30:58,600","01:31:00,687",Not his fault?
1357,"01:31:02,382","01:31:04,512","Yeah, it was shit."
1358,"01:31:04,904","01:31:07,730","It was shit, and we both
deserved better."
1359,"01:31:07,774","01:31:09,469","But the only person
you're punishing"
1360,"01:31:09,512","01:31:11,164","by not forgiving him
is yourself."
1361,"01:31:11,208","01:31:15,817","And Hardin, I want you
to stop punishing yourself."
1362,"01:31:16,948","01:31:18,861","So you think it's fair
that he gets to live in"
1363,"01:31:18,904","01:31:22,643","that big,
fancy house,and you're here all alone?"
1364,"01:31:22,687","01:31:24,730",Who said I was alone?
1365,"01:31:24,774","01:31:27,208","What?
You're seeing someone?"
1366,"01:31:27,251","01:31:31,382","- You don't have to sound so surprised.
- Who?"
1367,"01:31:31,817","01:31:33,904","- Mike.
- Mike?"
1368,"01:31:34,295","01:31:36,991","- Wanker-from-next-door Mike?
- He's not a wanker!"
1369,"01:31:37,035","01:31:39,687","- He is a bit of a wanker.
- He's a really nice man,"
1370,"01:31:39,730","01:31:41,687",and he treats me well.
1371,"01:31:41,730","01:31:44,121","Yeah, he fucking better."
1372,"01:31:45,121","01:31:48,382","Did you hear that Vance
was moving to Seattle?"
1373,"01:31:48,425","01:31:50,817","Tessa's going too.
How did you know?"
1374,"01:31:50,861","01:31:52,861","Well, we talk
from time to time."
1375,"01:31:52,904","01:31:55,208","He's having a going-away
party on Sunday,"
1376,"01:31:55,251","01:31:58,774","and I think you should get your
ass off this sofa and go get her."
1377,"01:31:58,817","01:31:59,892","No, I can't."
1378,"01:31:59,916","01:32:03,164","Can't? Or you don't want
to face what you left behind?"
1379,"01:32:03,208","01:32:04,556",I'd have to leave right now.
1380,"01:32:04,600","01:32:06,817",So what are you waiting for?
1381,"01:32:06,861","01:32:09,600","- Mum, I'm not gonna...
- Hardin..."
1382,"01:32:09,643","01:32:15,774","I love you, but you haveto start
fighting for what really matters."
1383,"01:32:25,687","01:32:27,600","Thank you all
so much for coming."
1384,"01:32:27,643","01:32:31,643","It means the world to me to
have everyone I love here with us."
1385,"01:32:31,687","01:32:33,817",I am... beyond proud
1386,"01:32:34,208","01:32:36,121","of the work that everyone
in this room has done,"
1387,"01:32:36,164","01:32:38,121","but there is one
particular person"
1388,"01:32:38,164","01:32:40,425","I could not have done
any of this without."
1389,"01:32:40,469","01:32:41,730",And that's Kimberly.
1390,"01:32:47,556","01:32:49,512","Smith and I were talking
the other day,"
1391,"01:32:49,556","01:32:51,556","and he said, ""Dad,
going-away parties are kind of sad."""
1392,"01:32:51,600","01:32:53,512",And he's got a point.
1393,"01:32:53,556","01:32:55,991","And we were like,
""How do we make this a celebration?"""
1394,"01:32:56,035","01:32:58,121",Then we got an idea.
1395,"01:33:02,948","01:33:06,121",- Kimberly...
1396,"01:33:07,295","01:33:10,078","will you marry my dad
and be my stepmom?"
1397,"01:33:10,121","01:33:12,251",Aww...
1398,"01:33:13,251","01:33:15,512",Yes!
1399,"01:33:15,556","01:33:17,382",Yes!
1400,"01:33:21,425","01:33:22,904",What about me?
1401,"01:33:25,251","01:33:27,774","- Aww...
- Yay!"
1402,"01:33:39,078","01:33:40,774",Who said happy endings don't exist?
1403,"01:33:40,817","01:33:42,556","Don't tell me.
You're the cynic."
1404,"01:33:42,600","01:33:45,425",I'm turning over a new leaf.
1405,"01:33:45,469","01:33:48,382","You look very pretty,by the way."
1406,"01:33:48,425","01:33:52,774","So... have you made up
your mind about Seattle?"
1407,"01:33:53,078","01:33:55,600","Well, I don't see
much of a reason"
1408,"01:33:55,643","01:33:58,991","to pass up the opportunity
anymore."
1409,"01:34:00,425","01:34:01,730",That's...
1410,"01:34:01,774","01:34:02,774",really nice to hear.
1411,"01:34:04,643","01:34:06,425","Look, Tessa,
there's something"
1412,"01:34:06,469","01:34:08,469","I actually want
to get off my chest."
1413,"01:34:08,512","01:34:10,600",Okay.
1414,"01:34:10,948","01:34:14,425","Uh, the other day,
in the hospital..."
1415,"01:34:14,469","01:34:16,295","I answered your cell phone,"
1416,"01:34:16,338","01:34:18,078","it was Hardin,"
1417,"01:34:18,121","01:34:21,382","and I told him
to stay away from you."
1418,"01:34:21,425","01:34:23,251","- What?
- In retrospect,"
1419,"01:34:23,295","01:34:25,817","I do realize that
that was over the line,"
1420,"01:34:25,861","01:34:29,774","and I do realize that I let my
emotions get the best of me,"
1421,"01:34:29,817","01:34:31,948","and I'm sorry,"
1422,"01:34:31,991","01:34:36,164","but somehow you bring
that side out of me, so..."
1423,"01:34:37,512","01:34:39,600",Okay.
1424,"01:34:41,425","01:34:43,164",Are you okay?
1425,"01:34:43,208","01:34:45,035",Eh.
1426,"01:34:45,078","01:34:47,295","There's actually
more I'd like to say,"
1427,"01:34:47,338","01:34:49,035","- but would you excuse me for a second?
- Yeah."
1428,"01:34:49,078","01:34:51,208",Thanks.
1429,"01:35:13,164","01:35:15,295",I'm so sorry.
1430,"01:35:26,861","01:35:28,991",Shit.
1431,"01:35:32,774","01:35:34,208",She left from the front.
1432,"01:35:34,251","01:35:36,382",Thank you.
1433,"01:35:40,730","01:35:42,861",Tessa!
1434,"01:35:56,600","01:36:01,078","You're just never gonna
leave me alone, are you?"
1435,"01:36:24,078","01:36:26,208",I tried.
1436,"01:37:24,078","01:37:26,382","So, you two have
a good Christmas?"
1437,"01:37:26,425","01:37:28,512","O-kay,
you're not talkin'."
1438,"01:37:28,556","01:37:31,208","So... hey, so I was dreamin'
of a white Christmas."
1439,"01:37:31,251","01:37:33,078",Hmph! All I got was heat.
1440,"01:37:33,121","01:37:35,643","You know, I hate the heat."
1441,"01:37:35,687","01:37:37,904",Heat get into people's minds
1442,"01:37:37,948","01:37:40,861","and make them do
some crazy things."
1443,"01:37:54,948","01:37:57,035","Like I said,"
1444,"01:37:57,078","01:38:00,469","this is a story
you've heard before."
1445,"01:38:00,512","01:38:03,774","Only difference is,
this isour story."
1446,"01:38:03,817","01:38:05,948",Tessa's and mine.
1447,"01:38:06,730","01:38:08,687","""I never wish to be parted from you"
1448,"01:38:08,730","01:38:10,861","from this day on."""
1449,"01:38:15,251","01:38:17,035",And who knows?
1450,"01:38:17,078","01:38:20,730","Maybe there is a happy ending
for us after all."
1451,"01:38:20,774","01:38:22,295",Tess.
1452,"01:38:22,338","01:38:24,687","- Hey...
- Hardin!"
1453,"01:38:26,164","01:38:28,295","- Dad?
- ""Dad""?"
1454,"01:38:29,425","01:38:31,338","I guess we'll just
have to find out."
1455,"01:40:09,774","01:40:12,035","Tessa.
Tessa."
1456,"01:40:12,078","01:40:13,251",Tessa.
1457,"01:40:13,295","01:40:14,991",Do you like to go on dates?
1458,"01:40:15,035","01:40:16,425",Because I don't.
1459,"01:40:16,469","01:40:18,817",But I-I will... with you.
1460,"01:40:19,730","01:40:21,382",If you wanna go.
1461,"01:40:22,991","01:40:23,991",Tessa.
1462,"01:40:24,035","01:40:25,991",That's so creepy.
1463,"01:40:26,035","01:40:27,991","I've been meaning to tell
you something for a long time,"
1464,"01:40:28,035","01:40:30,338","and the reason
that I haven't told you"
1465,"01:40:30,382","01:40:32,643","is because of Human Resources
in the workplace."
1466,"01:40:32,687","01:40:34,382","Don't talk about
Human Resources."
1467,"01:40:34,425","01:40:36,121",That's not... sexy.
1468,"01:40:36,164","01:40:37,600",Tessa!
1469,"01:40:37,643","01:40:39,251",Don't do the finger.
1470,"01:40:39,295","01:40:40,469",Put it down!
1471,"01:40:40,512","01:40:42,643",I only pull out my teal suit
1472,"01:40:42,687","01:40:44,774","when I have something
important to say."
1473,"01:40:44,817","01:40:46,643",- Occupied.
1474,"01:40:46,687","01:40:48,643",- Tessa.
1475,"01:40:48,687","01:40:50,556","There's other bathrooms
in the house"
1476,"01:40:50,600","01:40:53,208",if you need to go that badly.
1477,"01:40:54,600","01:40:56,904",Just go.
1478,"01:40:56,948","01:40:59,078",Yes. You can go now.
