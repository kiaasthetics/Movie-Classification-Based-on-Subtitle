2,"00:00:55,080","00:00:57,849","No. You gotta get out now!
I can't do this anymore."
3,"00:00:57,883","00:00:59,717","I will not let her see you
like this."
4,"00:00:59,751","00:01:02,319","- You need help!
- I didn't mean it. I'm sorry."
5,"00:01:02,353","00:01:04,588","- You're always sorry.
- Come on."
6,"00:01:04,622","00:01:06,490","How am I
supposed to believe you?"
7,"00:01:06,524","00:01:08,526","- Every time!
- You've been trying..."
8,"00:01:08,559","00:01:11,495","Do you know how many times
you've promised you would stop?"
9,"00:01:11,529","00:01:13,364","- This is not my fault.
- Not your fault?"
10,"00:01:13,397","00:01:15,332","You're drunk.
In the middle of the day."
11,"00:01:15,366","00:01:17,769","- Of course they fired you.
- Can we please talk about this?"
12,"00:01:17,803","00:01:20,772","- You don't give a shit about us.
- Please."
13,"00:01:20,806","00:01:22,007","- You have to go.
- Don't do this."
14,"00:01:22,040","00:01:23,674",Get out and don't come back
15,"00:01:23,707","00:01:25,342",till you're sober.
16,"00:01:25,376","00:01:26,410",Daddy?
17,"00:01:27,611","00:01:28,780",Daddy!
18,"00:01:32,017","00:01:33,919","Daddy, don't go!"
19,"00:01:33,952","00:01:35,987","No! No, no, no. Dad, please!"
20,"00:01:37,856","00:01:39,623","No, don't go."
21,"00:01:39,657","00:01:43,094","- Please don't go, please!
- Tessa! Tessa!"
22,"00:01:43,128","00:01:48,133","Please, Daddy. Don't go.
Daddy, please don't go."
23,"00:01:48,166","00:01:51,368",Daddy! No!
24,"00:02:02,848","00:02:06,051","I can't tell you how good it is
to see you again, Tessie."
25,"00:02:10,021","00:02:13,825","There's towels in the bathroom,
if you want to take a shower."
26,"00:02:13,859","00:02:16,660","- I'll make us some food.
- Thanks."
27,"00:02:28,006","00:02:29,406",This is good.
28,"00:02:31,009","00:02:33,078","I remember
you were quite the cook, Tessie."
29,"00:02:33,111","00:02:36,047","- Thanks.
- Just like your mom."
30,"00:02:39,150","00:02:41,186","I tried to call you, you know."
31,"00:02:41,219","00:02:45,723","Sent you gifts
every birthday, Christmas."
32,"00:02:45,757","00:02:47,658","She didn't tell you, did she?"
33,"00:02:50,128","00:02:51,462",No.
34,"00:02:52,529","00:02:53,832",Yeah.
35,"00:02:53,865","00:02:56,700","So the prodigal father
has returned."
36,"00:02:58,669","00:03:00,805",What for? What do you want?
37,"00:03:00,839","00:03:04,009","You can stay, if...
If you want to."
38,"00:03:04,042","00:03:07,012","We have room, and I don't
want you out on the street."
39,"00:03:12,117","00:03:14,986","- Are you still drinking?
- Can you excuse us for a second?"
40,"00:03:17,956","00:03:20,225","I know that this isn't
the most convenient,"
41,"00:03:20,258","00:03:22,227","but you, of all people,
should appreciate me"
42,"00:03:22,260","00:03:25,063","- giving him a second chance.
- Me, of all people, would know"
43,"00:03:25,096","00:03:26,898","that he's probably
out there right now"
44,"00:03:26,932","00:03:29,034","shoving all of our shit
into his pockets."
45,"00:03:30,835","00:03:32,103",He's gonna hurt you.
46,"00:03:32,137","00:03:34,471","- You don't know him.
- Neither do you."
47,"00:03:34,505","00:03:37,008","It's been, what, 10 years
since you last saw him?"
48,"00:03:39,643","00:03:40,711",Nine.
49,"00:03:42,579","00:03:44,682","Look, I'm just trying
to protect you."
50,"00:03:44,715","00:03:46,885",I don't need you to protect me.
51,"00:03:59,164","00:04:00,932","I know exactly why you're here,"
52,"00:04:00,966","00:04:03,634","so you may as well just
take this and be on your way."
53,"00:04:07,172","00:04:08,907","I don't want your money, kid."
54,"00:04:10,607","00:04:13,144","All I want is a relationship
with my daughter."
55,"00:04:15,747","00:04:19,184","- If you hurt her...
- Hey, whoa, easy."
56,"00:04:19,217","00:04:21,786","I know you have no reason
in the world to trust me,"
57,"00:04:21,820","00:04:23,955","but how about
you give me a shot, huh?"
58,"00:04:39,804","00:04:42,706","Well, have you found
a place in Seattle yet?"
59,"00:04:42,741","00:04:44,309","- Nope.
- No?"
60,"00:04:44,342","00:04:47,678","- Nope.
- I'm gonna miss you, dude."
61,"00:04:47,711","00:04:49,314","Gonna have to start watching
The Kardashians"
62,"00:04:49,347","00:04:51,715","to get my fill of drama
in your absence."
63,"00:04:51,750","00:04:54,853","Landon, I'm only going
to Seattle."
64,"00:04:54,886","00:04:57,588","You're just a FaceTime away.
You can always visit."
65,"00:04:57,621","00:05:00,258","Between work and school,
you are gonna be swamped."
66,"00:05:00,291","00:05:02,659","You're not gonna have
any time for anything,"
67,"00:05:02,693","00:05:05,964","like friends, family and
especially not people like..."
68,"00:05:09,367","00:05:12,536",People like who? Me?
69,"00:05:15,639","00:05:18,243","Is there something you wanna
tell me, or should I ask Landon?"
70,"00:05:18,276","00:05:20,045","He seems to know
a lot more than I do."
71,"00:05:20,078","00:05:24,015","Not today, Satan. I am
gonna see you both this weekend,"
72,"00:05:24,049","00:05:26,117","- at the lake house.
- Don't bet on it."
73,"00:05:26,151","00:05:27,718","- Okay.
- We'll be there."
74,"00:05:33,058","00:05:35,659","- What?
- What do you mean, what?"
75,"00:05:35,692","00:05:37,694","When was this
supposed to happen?"
76,"00:05:37,729","00:05:41,299","- A week?
- What? A week?"
77,"00:05:41,332","00:05:44,035","You're going away in a week,
you haven't even told me?"
78,"00:05:44,069","00:05:47,205","When was I supposed to tell you?
Because you left."
79,"00:05:48,406","00:05:50,275","Yeah, I'm here. I came back."
80,"00:05:50,308","00:05:52,177",And I came back for you.
81,"00:05:52,210","00:05:54,312","I couldn't get a hold
of you for nine days."
82,"00:05:54,345","00:05:56,580","I didn't know
if I'd ever see you again."
83,"00:05:59,784","00:06:01,319","So, what, is that it then?"
84,"00:06:02,954","00:06:05,622",I mean...
85,"00:06:05,656","00:06:10,195","Yeah, this... This job's a huge
opportunity for me. And..."
86,"00:06:10,228","00:06:14,265","And I'm hoping, I was hoping,
that you would come with me."
87,"00:06:17,902","00:06:21,773","I was hoping that we could move
to London after graduation."
88,"00:06:24,809","00:06:26,911","And how was I supposed
to know that?"
89,"00:06:26,945","00:06:28,379","Well, I was gonna tell you."
90,"00:06:28,413","00:06:31,049","But it doesn't really matter
anymore, does it?"
91,"00:06:31,082","00:06:33,184","You've made up your mind,
you've got a plan."
92,"00:06:33,218","00:06:35,120","Envisioned your life in a way
that doesn't have me in it."
93,"00:06:35,153","00:06:37,388","You are in it,
if you want to be."
94,"00:06:40,325","00:06:42,693","Look, I get that you're angry."
95,"00:06:42,727","00:06:44,262","And we do
need to talk about this,"
96,"00:06:44,295","00:06:46,364","except I have
to get to class, so..."
97,"00:06:48,133","00:06:51,736","We will continue
this discussion."
98,"00:06:51,769","00:06:53,271","Oh, that's really big of you."
99,"00:06:53,304","00:06:56,040","To find time in
your busy schedule. Thank you."
100,"00:07:08,319","00:07:09,653",Hey.
101,"00:07:28,339","00:07:30,008","Hi, Mom, how's London?"
102,"00:07:30,041","00:07:32,810","Good. I just wanted
to check you're okay."
103,"00:07:32,844","00:07:36,281","I heard that Tessa took the job
with Vance, in Seattle."
104,"00:07:36,314","00:07:37,749",Where did you hear that?
105,"00:07:37,782","00:07:39,851","Christian and I
were talking earlier."
106,"00:07:39,884","00:07:41,186",That's kind of weird.
107,"00:07:41,219","00:07:42,787",He and I have known each other
108,"00:07:42,820","00:07:44,289",since long before you were born.
109,"00:07:44,322","00:07:46,324","I'd prefer not everyone
knows my business."
110,"00:07:46,357","00:07:48,159","Mom, I'm gonna call you back."
111,"00:08:08,213","00:08:09,981",Do you need a ride somewhere?
112,"00:08:13,051","00:08:15,420","Uh, yeah. Yeah, sure."
113,"00:08:25,964","00:08:27,799","- Thanks.
- Mm-hm."
114,"00:08:30,568","00:08:32,237","Hey, you wanna come inside?"
115,"00:08:35,907","00:08:37,375","Fuck it, why not."
116,"00:08:44,048","00:08:45,183",Enjoy.
117,"00:08:47,552","00:08:49,220",What are we drinking about?
118,"00:08:49,254","00:08:51,956","I didn't know
we needed a reason."
119,"00:08:51,990","00:08:53,124",Cheers to that.
120,"00:08:59,497","00:09:02,867","Oh, look at her in this one."
121,"00:09:02,900","00:09:04,402",Mmm.
122,"00:09:06,838","00:09:08,973",She looks really happy.
123,"00:09:09,007","00:09:13,144","I've really been trying.
Now more than ever."
124,"00:09:13,177","00:09:14,946","- Yeah.
- Well..."
125,"00:09:14,979","00:09:18,449","Clearly not right now.
But I am trying."
126,"00:09:18,483","00:09:21,286","You know, you really remind me
of me when I was your age."
127,"00:09:21,319","00:09:23,821","- Fuck that.
- Mmm, yeah."
128,"00:09:23,855","00:09:26,424","- Seriously?
- Hey. Hey, buddy."
129,"00:09:26,457","00:09:28,426","Private conversation,
if you don't mind."
130,"00:09:28,459","00:09:30,862","Hey, just trying
to get some ideas."
131,"00:09:30,895","00:09:33,031",Whoa!
132,"00:09:33,064","00:09:35,366","That is my daughter,
you fucking piece of shit."
133,"00:09:45,910","00:09:47,011",Hey.
134,"00:09:49,614","00:09:51,316","I'm sorry, who is this?"
135,"00:09:52,650","00:09:54,585",What are you doing here?
136,"00:09:54,619","00:09:57,322","Uh, bonding."
137,"00:09:57,355","00:09:58,389","- Hey, Tess.
- Hardin..."
138,"00:10:00,358","00:10:01,893",What the hell did you do?
139,"00:10:01,926","00:10:04,562","- I didn't do any...
- The bartender called me."
140,"00:10:04,595","00:10:06,597","Oh, come on.
It wasn't a big deal."
141,"00:10:06,631","00:10:09,867","- Look, he's fine.
- You're drunk."
142,"00:10:09,901","00:10:11,969","I had a drink. I just...
Look, it was..."
143,"00:10:12,003","00:10:13,471","- I was backing up your dad.
- Really?"
144,"00:10:13,504","00:10:15,973","I didn't start...
He started it actually, so..."
145,"00:10:16,007","00:10:17,342",Somebody called the cops.
146,"00:10:17,375","00:10:19,177","You probably called the cops,
you snitch."
147,"00:10:19,210","00:10:21,079","Okay, let's go."
148,"00:10:21,112","00:10:23,081",Don't be mad at him.
149,"00:10:23,114","00:10:24,382",He loves you.
150,"00:10:25,917","00:10:27,118",That's all.
151,"00:10:28,619","00:10:30,455",Whoa!
152,"00:10:30,488","00:10:35,960","Yeah, you see that?
Solid guy right there."
153,"00:10:35,993","00:10:38,196","- Why would anyone leave you?
- I don't know."
154,"00:10:38,229","00:10:40,298","Yeah, this is just...
It's so enjoyable."
155,"00:10:40,331","00:10:42,600",Why wouldn't I stay?
156,"00:10:42,633","00:10:44,035",I think we're in trouble.
157,"00:10:44,068","00:10:46,204","Hey, hey, hey, easy."
158,"00:11:18,369","00:11:21,672","You know, I'm not sure
that I like this new friendship."
159,"00:11:21,706","00:11:24,142",I was just trying to be nice.
160,"00:11:24,175","00:11:26,944","I offered him a ride, and
the bar was actually his idea."
161,"00:11:26,978","00:11:29,947","He's an alcoholic,
and so are you."
162,"00:11:31,983","00:11:34,285",Two alcoholics walk into a bar.
163,"00:11:39,257","00:11:41,392","I'm glad
you think this is funny."
164,"00:11:41,426","00:11:44,061","I was showing him some
pictures of you on my phone,"
165,"00:11:44,095","00:11:45,463",and this asshole leans over
166,"00:11:45,496","00:11:47,965","and starts saying
what he'd like to do to you."
167,"00:11:50,736","00:11:53,104","So... I mean, so?"
168,"00:11:53,137","00:11:55,406","So I told him
I've already done that."
169,"00:12:17,328","00:12:19,297","- Hardin...
- What?"
170,"00:12:23,334","00:12:25,169",I'm apologizing.
171,"00:12:50,061","00:12:51,028",I'm sorry.
172,"00:12:52,296","00:12:54,065",I'm so sorry.
173,"00:12:59,103","00:13:01,706","- Please forgive me.
- I, that's..."
174,"00:13:03,241","00:13:06,511","- That's not fair.
- Please forgive me."
175,"00:13:06,544","00:13:09,647","- What if...?
- Shh, he's asleep."
176,"00:13:41,479","00:13:43,481",Tessa.
177,"00:13:44,783","00:13:46,250","Oh, Tessa."
178,"00:13:58,296","00:14:00,097","Oh, fuck..."
179,"00:14:17,448","00:14:21,319","So, uh, I heard
you guys are moving."
180,"00:14:21,352","00:14:24,322","Yeah, yeah. I actually need
to start packing."
181,"00:14:24,355","00:14:26,691","I'll just finish up
and get out of here."
182,"00:14:26,724","00:14:28,559","No, no, no.
No, I didn't mean it like..."
183,"00:14:28,593","00:14:30,762","Nah, nah.
You don't need me around here."
184,"00:14:30,796","00:14:33,431","I'll just... I got
a few errands to run anyway."
185,"00:14:33,464","00:14:34,833",Dad...
186,"00:14:38,904","00:14:40,772",That feels really weird to say.
187,"00:14:44,609","00:14:45,844","Well, that'll be my ride."
188,"00:14:48,479","00:14:49,781",You're leaving now?
189,"00:14:50,916","00:14:52,918",Yeah.
190,"00:14:52,951","00:14:54,151",Come here.
191,"00:14:56,788","00:14:59,123","Thank you so much
for letting me stay."
192,"00:15:01,760","00:15:03,694","No, stay, stay. He's coming."
193,"00:15:05,831","00:15:07,565","Uh, hey, don't..."
194,"00:15:10,769","00:15:13,304",Don't disappear on me again.
195,"00:15:21,312","00:15:22,413",Hardin.
196,"00:15:29,687","00:15:31,656",So you shipping me out next?
197,"00:15:37,528","00:15:39,563","- You okay?
- You know, it's not like"
198,"00:15:39,597","00:15:40,899",I want to leave you.
199,"00:15:42,801","00:15:43,769",You don't have to.
200,"00:15:46,004","00:15:49,440","Vance's offer, it's literally...
It's a dream come true."
201,"00:15:49,473","00:15:51,777","I've wanted to live in Seattle
since I was a kid."
202,"00:15:51,810","00:15:53,745","The only thing
that would make it better"
203,"00:15:53,779","00:15:55,613",is if you came with me.
204,"00:15:55,646","00:15:58,582","I don't... I don't know
why you want me there."
205,"00:16:00,384","00:16:02,653","I don't really fit
into that flashy lifestyle."
206,"00:16:02,687","00:16:04,823","It's never been the kind of
thing you've been after..."
207,"00:16:04,856","00:16:06,925","- I want to make a life together.
- So do I."
208,"00:16:06,958","00:16:08,492","So stay here, and we can."
209,"00:16:08,526","00:16:10,294","- You're not listening.
- I am listening."
210,"00:16:10,327","00:16:12,363","- I've wanted this job since I...
- I know."
211,"00:16:12,396","00:16:14,900","You have a great job in Seattle.
That is great."
212,"00:16:14,933","00:16:17,736","I'm happy for you. But I don't.
I don't have anything there."
213,"00:16:17,769","00:16:20,337","- You'd have me.
- Okay, that's not enough."
214,"00:16:25,409","00:16:27,311",You know I didn't mean that.
215,"00:16:31,682","00:16:33,584","Well, if I'm..."
216,"00:16:33,617","00:16:37,254","If I'm not enough, that's...
That's your problem."
217,"00:16:37,288","00:16:38,857",But you're not gonna stop me.
218,"00:17:25,436","00:17:27,304","Vance Publishing, please hold."
219,"00:17:27,338","00:17:28,974","No, I can't. I'm swamped."
220,"00:17:29,007","00:17:30,842","You're gonna have to speak
to my assistant."
221,"00:17:30,876","00:17:32,710","No, the new one."
222,"00:17:34,012","00:17:36,014","Um, well, I'll try
and squeeze you in"
223,"00:17:36,047","00:17:37,983",for 30 minutes this afternoon.
224,"00:17:38,016","00:17:39,785","Tessa! Hey, come in."
225,"00:17:39,818","00:17:42,087","- I can come back.
- No, no. Come in. I'm just..."
226,"00:17:42,120","00:17:43,855","- I'm heading out.
- Yeah."
227,"00:17:43,889","00:17:47,959","- Um, you have a safe trip.
- Okay. See you."
228,"00:17:49,728","00:17:52,630","Are you sure that you're okay
driving up by yourself?"
229,"00:17:52,663","00:17:55,066","- She's not going by herself.
- I'm taking Smith with me."
230,"00:17:58,369","00:18:00,471","Besides, I prefer to get us
settled up there"
231,"00:18:00,504","00:18:03,440","while Christian
finishes things here."
232,"00:18:03,474","00:18:05,811","Have you decided what part
of town you'll be staying in?"
233,"00:18:05,844","00:18:08,412","No, I'm still deciding
between two places."
234,"00:18:08,445","00:18:10,849","It's scary trying to pick
somewhere off the internet."
235,"00:18:10,882","00:18:12,683","No, Tessa. Just stay with us."
236,"00:18:12,716","00:18:14,052","You know,
until you get situated."
237,"00:18:14,085","00:18:15,653","No, no. I couldn't ask..."
238,"00:18:15,686","00:18:19,024","You didn't.
Come on, it'll be fun."
239,"00:18:19,057","00:18:20,558",Christian will be thrilled.
240,"00:18:20,591","00:18:22,994","He's been dying
to spend time with Hardin."
241,"00:18:23,028","00:18:26,731","Uh, well, he's actually
not coming with me."
242,"00:18:26,765","00:18:28,967",Oh.
243,"00:18:29,000","00:18:31,335","Well, when he comes
to visit, then."
244,"00:18:34,806","00:18:38,143","You know, between us,"
245,"00:18:38,176","00:18:40,979","Christian was disappointed
Hardin turned him down"
246,"00:18:41,012","00:18:42,881",on his job offer.
247,"00:18:42,914","00:18:46,550",What... What job was that?
248,"00:18:47,886","00:18:50,421","Basically, anything he wanted."
249,"00:19:05,569","00:19:06,872",Hey.
250,"00:19:06,905","00:19:09,007","Hey, hey, hey.
Don't walk away from me."
251,"00:19:09,040","00:19:11,508","- Hey, don't follow me.
- Tess, I'm sorry."
252,"00:19:11,542","00:19:13,644","I didn't mean it.
I shouldn't have said it."
253,"00:19:13,677","00:19:15,713","Can you stop saying things
you don't mean?"
254,"00:19:15,747","00:19:17,182",I can't tell what's true.
255,"00:19:17,215","00:19:18,917",Can you stop making decisions
256,"00:19:18,950","00:19:20,852","without talking things
through first?"
257,"00:19:22,854","00:19:24,022",Okay.
258,"00:19:25,924","00:19:27,625",Okay.
259,"00:19:27,658","00:19:30,661","Kimberly invited me to stay
with them in Seattle,"
260,"00:19:30,694","00:19:32,831","- if that's not weird?
- Did she?"
261,"00:19:32,864","00:19:34,833","No, no, no. It's not weird."
262,"00:19:34,866","00:19:36,935",It's good. It's great.
263,"00:19:36,968","00:19:40,005","Vance is always gone,
so I think it'll be a win-win."
264,"00:19:40,038","00:19:41,405",Yeah.
265,"00:19:43,574","00:19:46,443","How do you think they make
that work, the long-distance?"
266,"00:19:46,477","00:19:48,412","I don't know, they communicate?"
267,"00:19:49,915","00:19:52,918","Heh, wait, wait, wait.
What was that?"
268,"00:19:52,951","00:19:55,653","- What?
- The thing underneath the thing"
269,"00:19:55,686","00:19:58,223",that you just said.
270,"00:19:58,256","00:19:59,791",Why didn't you tell me
271,"00:19:59,824","00:20:02,626","that Vance offered you
a job in Seattle?"
272,"00:20:02,660","00:20:04,195",Because I wasn't gonna take it.
273,"00:20:04,229","00:20:07,098","But why didn't you tell me
that you weren't gonna take it?"
274,"00:20:07,132","00:20:09,134","Here I am,
begging you to come with me,"
275,"00:20:09,167","00:20:11,903","- just to find out that...
- He kept on harping on me."
276,"00:20:11,937","00:20:13,972","It wasn't something
I wanted to deal with."
277,"00:20:14,005","00:20:16,875","Remember, at the time,
I had no idea you were going."
278,"00:20:18,276","00:20:20,045",We do need to stop
279,"00:20:20,078","00:20:21,980",keeping secrets from each other.
280,"00:20:24,515","00:20:25,784",Agreed.
281,"00:20:44,803","00:20:46,738","We'll have fun
this weekend, okay?"
282,"00:20:47,806","00:20:48,940",Okay.
283,"00:21:07,092","00:21:08,126",You look like Popeye.
284,"00:21:10,729","00:21:14,199","- A very sexy Popeye, come on.
- Get up, we're gonna be late."
285,"00:21:19,204","00:21:21,306","We could've just met you there,
couldn't we?"
286,"00:21:21,339","00:21:23,008","Why did we have to
all come together?"
287,"00:21:23,041","00:21:25,576","- We could've made our own way.
- It's a long drive."
288,"00:21:25,609","00:21:26,945","And this way, we get to have"
289,"00:21:26,978","00:21:29,546","some very much needed
family time."
290,"00:21:29,580","00:21:30,547",Yeah.
291,"00:21:30,581","00:21:31,916","Much needed, great."
292,"00:21:33,018","00:21:34,819",You're lucky I love you.
293,"00:21:36,087","00:21:39,891","Okay, I spy with my little eye"
294,"00:21:39,924","00:21:41,126",something black.
295,"00:21:41,159","00:21:44,295","Black. Easy, Hardin's soul."
296,"00:21:44,329","00:21:45,964","- Oh, yeah, ha-ha!
- Hey!"
297,"00:21:45,997","00:21:47,198","- Come on, boys!
- That's why."
298,"00:21:47,232","00:21:49,067","- Boys...
- That's why your soul is black."
299,"00:21:49,100","00:21:50,935","Hey, don't touch this!"
300,"00:22:13,925","00:22:15,126",Shut up!
301,"00:22:33,945","00:22:36,047",Are you still going to New York?
302,"00:22:36,081","00:22:40,819","Yeah, I've got everything set up
at NYU, so I'm just gonna..."
303,"00:22:40,852","00:22:43,288","I guess, go with the flow,
you know?"
304,"00:22:43,321","00:22:47,058","Mmm. I need
to get better at that."
305,"00:22:47,092","00:22:50,728","Are you having...
You having second thoughts?"
306,"00:22:50,762","00:22:53,798","And third and fourth
and fifth and..."
307,"00:22:53,832","00:22:56,935","I don't know. I'm just worried
that I made the wrong decision."
308,"00:22:56,968","00:23:00,671","- Tess...
- It's just, apparently..."
309,"00:23:00,704","00:23:05,143","Hardin wanted me to go England
with him after graduation."
310,"00:23:05,176","00:23:07,979","And I don't know.
Maybe I should."
311,"00:23:08,012","00:23:10,714","You've been
gushing about Seattle"
312,"00:23:10,748","00:23:12,383",since the day I first met you.
313,"00:23:12,417","00:23:13,952",Why stray from your path?
314,"00:23:15,253","00:23:18,156","- Go with the flow?
- No, no."
315,"00:23:18,189","00:23:20,959","Cop-out. That's not you.
That's me."
316,"00:23:20,992","00:23:22,794",You have to do you.
317,"00:23:22,827","00:23:25,029","Yeah, and what about him?"
318,"00:23:25,063","00:23:28,233","What about him?
Mr. Grumpy? He's..."
319,"00:23:28,266","00:23:32,103","If he loves you, he could..."
320,"00:23:32,137","00:23:33,838","follow you.
I'm just saying."
321,"00:23:34,873","00:23:37,075",Ooh! Wow.
322,"00:23:37,108","00:23:39,744","Mm, some hard truth.
It's tough love."
323,"00:23:39,777","00:23:42,881","- I'm gonna need more wine.
- Good luck."
324,"00:23:46,451","00:23:48,853",See? Did you see...?
325,"00:24:16,381","00:24:18,183",I don't want to lose this.
326,"00:24:21,352","00:24:22,887",I don't either.

what you're writing there?"

340,"00:25:16,908","00:25:21,346","- Reservation for Scott.
- Yes, Mr. Scott. Right this way."
341,"00:25:29,387","00:25:32,457","- Thank you.
- Hardin?"
342,"00:25:32,490","00:25:36,494","- Ha! Hey, Lilly. How are you?
- Mm!"
343,"00:25:36,527","00:25:38,830","- How are you?
- No fucking way."
344,"00:25:38,863","00:25:40,898","- Long time, huh?
- It's been forever."
345,"00:25:40,932","00:25:43,968","- This is Tessa. Tessa, Lillian.
- Hi."
346,"00:25:44,002","00:25:45,503",Nice dress.
347,"00:25:49,240","00:25:50,942",I'll be over in a second.

351,"00:26:01,953","00:26:04,489","- Good evening, folks.
- Yes. Good evening."
352,"00:26:04,522","00:26:06,557","I'm Robert. I'll be
taking care of you tonight."
353,"00:26:06,591","00:26:08,926","Can I get you started
with a round of drinks?"
354,"00:26:08,960","00:26:11,929","Yeah. I think we'll do
a bottle of Cab for the table."
355,"00:26:11,963","00:26:14,832","- And some water for us.
- I think we're ready to order."
356,"00:26:14,866","00:26:17,835","- Great, what'll it be?
- You're gonna get the..."
357,"00:26:17,869","00:26:20,505","- Crab cakes.
- Yes. And I'm gonna get the..."
358,"00:26:20,538","00:26:22,240","- fish and chips.
- Fish and chips."
359,"00:26:22,273","00:26:24,575","And also, we would
like to get a sablefish"
360,"00:26:24,609","00:26:26,411",for after the meal to take home.
361,"00:26:26,444","00:26:28,012",That's a good choice.

363,"00:26:31,916","00:26:33,584",that you'd recommend?
364,"00:26:33,618","00:26:37,088","The cedar-planked salmon
is our specialty."
365,"00:26:37,121","00:26:40,925",Okay. I'm more into like pasta?
366,"00:26:40,958","00:26:43,194","Carbs, yeah. I love carbs."
367,"00:26:43,227","00:26:46,431","Um, we have
a squid-ink spaghetti."
368,"00:26:47,565","00:26:49,167","Um, it was lovely to see you"
369,"00:26:49,200","00:26:52,170","and to meet you guys,
but I'll have to go. Sorry."
370,"00:26:52,203","00:26:55,206","Too fancy. How about we
whip you up something special?"
371,"00:26:58,042","00:26:59,844","Yeah, okay. Thank you."
372,"00:27:01,312","00:27:03,414","Can I get you anything,
or do you need a minute?"
373,"00:27:03,448","00:27:05,983","Yeah, you can come back."
374,"00:27:06,017","00:27:07,251",Robert.
375,"00:27:09,320","00:27:10,955","- Thanks, man.
- Thank you, Robert."
376,"00:27:10,988","00:27:12,256",Thank you.
377,"00:27:18,396","00:27:19,897",Alone at last.
378,"00:27:22,066","00:27:23,634",Ooh!
379,"00:27:23,668","00:27:25,236",That's good.
380,"00:27:29,707","00:27:33,311","Come on, before they get home."
381,"00:27:37,582","00:27:38,916","Ow, ow!"
382,"00:27:44,589","00:27:47,492","I really hope they're having
more than one cocktail."
383,"00:27:49,060","00:27:51,662","You do kind of like it, though."
384,"00:27:51,696","00:27:53,498",The thrill of being caught.
385,"00:28:01,439","00:28:03,174","Oh, that's nice."
386,"00:28:38,576","00:28:39,677",Trust me.
387,"00:30:55,747","00:30:58,516","I really wish you
were coming to Seattle."
388,"00:31:01,719","00:31:05,556","- Can I ask you a question?
- Mmm."
389,"00:31:05,590","00:31:08,492","Does your moving to Seattle
have anything to do with Trevor?"
390,"00:31:12,463","00:31:18,402","No. No. I mean...
we barely even talk anymore."
391,"00:31:24,241","00:31:26,110","Did you ever
have feelings for him?"
392,"00:31:27,345","00:31:29,647","- That's two questions.
- Tess, be honest."
393,"00:31:38,857","00:31:41,592","Uh, there was a moment when..."
394,"00:31:43,294","00:31:46,798","Hey! Seriously?
That's not fair!"
395,"00:31:48,332","00:31:49,634",Hardin!
396,"00:31:57,776","00:31:59,710",Leave a message.
397,"00:32:01,780","00:32:04,582","Hey, where are you?
Can you give me a call back?"
398,"00:32:41,719","00:32:45,356","- Robert.
- Right. Um, Tessa."
399,"00:32:45,389","00:32:46,925","So, what are you doing
out here?"
400,"00:32:48,592","00:32:52,831",I had a fight with my...
401,"00:32:52,864","00:32:55,000",It's complicated.
402,"00:32:55,033","00:32:58,536","Well, a few of us are doing
after hours, if you wanna join."
403,"00:32:58,569","00:33:00,739","- Um, yeah.
- Yeah?"
404,"00:33:00,772","00:33:02,239","- Yeah.
- Okay."
405,"00:33:03,708","00:33:05,977","Heh, you probably
should've worn a coat."
406,"00:33:10,448","00:33:13,651","- So you live here, right?
- Born and raised."
407,"00:33:13,684","00:33:16,287","But I actually just got
into med school."
408,"00:33:16,320","00:33:18,790","- Oh, wow.
- Yeah, so just working here,"
409,"00:33:18,824","00:33:19,858",saving up till then.
410,"00:33:19,891","00:33:21,726","- Wow, congratulations.
- Thanks."
411,"00:33:21,760","00:33:23,394",Where are you going?
412,"00:33:23,427","00:33:24,830","UW was my dream,"
413,"00:33:24,863","00:33:26,932","but Mount Sinai gave me
a scholarship"
414,"00:33:26,965","00:33:30,301","- I couldn't pass up, so...
- Mount Sinai is in...?"
415,"00:33:30,334","00:33:31,870","- NYC.
- Okay."
416,"00:33:31,903","00:33:33,872","New York City.
You've heard of it."
417,"00:33:33,905","00:33:35,606","The Big Apple, you know?"
418,"00:33:35,639","00:33:38,576","And Nora, actually, Nora and I
went to undergrad together"
419,"00:33:38,609","00:33:41,712","and then she moved out there,
so I'll know someone."
420,"00:33:41,747","00:33:43,614",Talking shit? Yeah?
421,"00:33:43,647","00:33:45,616","She's already got
the New York attitude."
422,"00:33:45,649","00:33:48,385","- Tess. Hey.
- Hey! Hey."
423,"00:33:48,419","00:33:50,654","Okay, so this is Robert,
and this is Nora."
424,"00:33:50,688","00:33:53,724","Yes, there will be a test
afterwards."
425,"00:33:53,759","00:33:55,827",And they both live in New York.
426,"00:33:55,861","00:33:57,763",Thank you.
427,"00:33:57,796","00:33:59,798",In New York? Pleasure.
428,"00:33:59,831","00:34:02,333","Hey! What? Oh, my God!"
429,"00:34:03,534","00:34:05,871","How are you?
It's been..."
430,"00:34:05,904","00:34:08,606","- You remember Robert, right?
- Yeah."
431,"00:34:08,639","00:34:11,442","I remember Robert. I'll do
an old fashioned, actually."
432,"00:34:11,475","00:34:13,044","Oh. I'm off, actually."
433,"00:34:13,078","00:34:15,814","You're still wearing your
name tag and your uniform, so..."
434,"00:34:18,415","00:34:20,886","So I heard
that you're moving to Seattle."
435,"00:34:20,919","00:34:23,654","Yeah, um, I'm actually
transferring for work."
436,"00:34:23,687","00:34:25,723","Ah, I'm jealous."
437,"00:34:25,757","00:34:27,625","I'd much rather be
in Seattle than New York."
438,"00:34:27,658","00:34:29,660","I keep telling Hardin
he should give it a shot."
439,"00:34:29,693","00:34:32,596","- It's not for me.
- No, it's not for him."
440,"00:34:32,630","00:34:33,732","- It's the best.
- It's the best."
441,"00:34:33,765","00:34:35,399","It is, yeah.
My girlfriend and I,"
442,"00:34:35,432","00:34:37,803","we've lived in Capitol Hill
for a few years now."
443,"00:34:37,836","00:34:41,372","- Oh, your girlfriend?
- Yeah, my girlfriend, Riley."
444,"00:34:41,405","00:34:43,707",We should probably leave now.
445,"00:34:43,742","00:34:46,677","I don't really
wanna go just yet."
446,"00:34:49,413","00:34:50,949",I'm gonna head home.
447,"00:34:55,954","00:34:57,555",Let me walk you out.
448,"00:35:03,962","00:35:07,464","- I'm really sorry about all of...
- You don't have to apologize."
449,"00:35:07,498","00:35:08,834",Sorry.
450,"00:35:08,867","00:35:11,102",Sorry. Heh!
451,"00:35:11,136","00:35:12,971",I don't know why I do that.
452,"00:35:14,505","00:35:16,707","I could guess, but I won't."
453,"00:35:21,780","00:35:24,015","Um, it was nice meeting you."
454,"00:35:24,049","00:35:26,617",You too.
455,"00:35:26,650","00:35:28,019",And thanks for...
456,"00:35:29,888","00:35:30,889",Mm-hm.
457,"00:35:33,992","00:35:35,994","I'm not expecting anything,"
458,"00:35:36,027","00:35:40,065","but if someday you find
yourself in the city..."
459,"00:35:42,901","00:35:46,104",give me a call. Or don't.
460,"00:35:46,137","00:35:47,739",It's up to you.
461,"00:36:09,060","00:36:10,862",Hey.
462,"00:36:10,896","00:36:12,931",Hey.
463,"00:36:12,964","00:36:14,065",Morning.
464,"00:36:21,740","00:36:24,642","- What's that face?
- How was... How was last night?"
465,"00:36:24,675","00:36:27,711","Oh, it was good. It was...
It was fine."
466,"00:36:27,746","00:36:29,080","Nora's nice. She's, uh..."
467,"00:36:29,114","00:36:31,850","She's kind of a big deal
on the restaurant scene,"
468,"00:36:31,883","00:36:34,551","so she's gonna show me around
when I get to New York."
469,"00:36:34,585","00:36:37,454","- That's really convenient.
- It's all about... Heh-heh."
470,"00:36:39,590","00:36:42,827","How was...
How was the hot tub?"
471,"00:37:10,989","00:37:12,489",Guess what Landon found.
472,"00:37:25,303","00:37:28,706","I thought that we were gonna be
more open with each other."
473,"00:37:34,846","00:37:36,748",So did I.
474,"00:37:36,781","00:37:39,650","I didn't ask for his number.
He just gave it to me. It..."
475,"00:37:39,683","00:37:42,586","No. I just found another
guy's number in your things."
476,"00:37:44,122","00:37:47,691","You made it look like you were
with Lillian last night."
477,"00:37:47,725","00:37:49,728","- Lillian's my friend.
- So is he."
478,"00:37:49,761","00:37:51,796","You guys just met.
How could you be friends?"
479,"00:37:51,830","00:37:55,066","You do this. You sabotage
every good moment that we have."
480,"00:37:55,100","00:37:57,701","No. If I wanted to try
and sabotage a good moment,"
481,"00:37:57,736","00:37:59,738","I would have brought
up your moment with Trevor,"
482,"00:37:59,771","00:38:02,107","- but I'll do one at a time.
- Why can't you let things be?"
483,"00:38:02,140","00:38:04,641","- Like, let us be happy for once.
- Tess, you must admit,"
484,"00:38:04,675","00:38:07,278","if I were moving away
with an admitted love interest,"
485,"00:38:07,312","00:38:09,848","- you'd have feelings about that.
- Love interest?"
486,"00:38:09,881","00:38:11,816",We're friends. From work.
487,"00:38:11,850","00:38:13,752","You don't get to choose
who I have as friends."
488,"00:38:13,785","00:38:15,987","They don't wanna
be your fucking friends!"
489,"00:38:16,021","00:38:17,922","Then why can't you
just trust me?"
490,"00:38:17,956","00:38:20,091","I do trust you.
It's them I don't trust."
491,"00:38:20,125","00:38:21,658","No, you don't."
492,"00:38:21,692","00:38:23,762","You don't trust me.
You don't trust anyone."
493,"00:38:23,795","00:38:24,963",You just control them.
494,"00:38:30,201","00:38:33,938","Is this really about them,
or is this about me moving?"
495,"00:38:33,972","00:38:36,941","The irony is, I got you
the damn job in the first place."
496,"00:38:36,975","00:38:40,677","I mean, I might have had
something to do with it."
497,"00:38:40,711","00:38:42,679","Tess, how many freshmen
do you know"
498,"00:38:42,713","00:38:44,282","with jobs
at top publishing firms,"
499,"00:38:44,315","00:38:47,584","their transfer's taken care of,
places to live, how many?"
500,"00:38:48,787","00:38:50,687",Wow.
501,"00:38:50,721","00:38:53,058","This honesty thing's
really paying off for us."
502,"00:38:53,091","00:38:54,725",So I won't...
503,"00:38:54,759","00:38:58,029","I won't give up Seattle for
you, so you just turn on me?"
504,"00:39:00,765","00:39:03,068","There is a big difference
between not being able"
505,"00:39:03,101","00:39:05,070","to live without someone
and loving them."
506,"00:39:21,386","00:39:24,322","He is scared of losing you.
He loves you."
507,"00:39:24,355","00:39:27,992","He knows you're the best thing
that's ever happened to him."
508,"00:39:28,026","00:39:31,229","- Well...
- No, Tessa, it's true."
509,"00:39:31,262","00:39:34,732","You've changed his life.
He knows it."
510,"00:39:34,766","00:39:36,000",We all know it.
511,"00:39:37,202","00:39:40,105",You stay in touch. Okay.
512,"00:39:40,138","00:39:41,638",Bye.
513,"00:40:42,467","00:40:44,836","She's gonna thrive
up there, man."
514,"00:40:44,869","00:40:46,437","What, and that's a bad thing?"
515,"00:40:48,473","00:40:52,010","This is a big step for her.
You should be happy for her."
516,"00:40:52,043","00:40:53,278",I am.
517,"00:40:56,114","00:40:57,714",I am happy.
518,"00:41:05,089","00:41:07,959","You could come with her.
I've got loads of work for you..."
519,"00:41:07,992","00:41:10,261","- I don't wanna do that.
- You'd get great benefits."
520,"00:41:10,295","00:41:12,363",I don't want your handouts.
521,"00:41:12,397","00:41:14,199","I'm sorry, I..."
522,"00:41:14,232","00:41:17,101","They're the reason I'm here,
and I don't want any more help."
523,"00:41:18,403","00:41:20,905",Tessa didn't get a favor.
524,"00:41:20,939","00:41:22,740",She's excellent.
525,"00:41:22,774","00:41:24,209",She earned this position.
526,"00:41:27,011","00:41:28,446",She does deserve it.
527,"00:41:31,249","00:41:33,384",I'm sure she'll do smashingly.
528,"00:41:49,400","00:41:50,868",Tessa?
529,"00:41:55,206","00:41:56,407",Tess?
530,"00:42:00,111","00:42:02,180",Tess?
531,"00:43:14,152","00:43:15,219",Pain.
532,"00:43:15,253","00:43:16,387","Lately, I've become"
533,"00:43:16,421","00:43:18,489",very well acquainted with it.
534,"00:43:18,523","00:43:21,926","The slow and steady
aching pain,"
535,"00:43:21,959","00:43:24,429","the type that comes when
you've been hurt repeatedly"
536,"00:43:24,462","00:43:26,197",by the same person.
537,"00:43:32,970","00:43:35,206","You finally breathe,"
538,"00:43:35,239","00:43:37,975","thinking that yesterday's
problem will stay in the past"
539,"00:43:38,009","00:43:41,079","when, in fact,
it's today's problem,"
540,"00:43:41,112","00:43:42,413","tomorrow's problem,"
541,"00:43:42,447","00:43:44,949","and the problem
of every day after that."
542,"00:43:49,387","00:43:52,990","Only in those rare moments
when he pulls me to his chest"
543,"00:43:53,024","00:43:55,626","and makes promises
he never seems able to keep"
544,"00:43:55,660","00:43:57,562",does the pain disappear.
545,"00:44:07,271","00:44:09,107",Shit. She looks upset.
546,"00:44:11,075","00:44:12,443","- Hey!
- Hey!"
547,"00:44:14,112","00:44:15,646","Let me take that
for you upstairs."
548,"00:44:15,680","00:44:17,081","Oh, thanks."
549,"00:44:19,384","00:44:21,652","- Welcome home.
- Thanks."
550,"00:44:23,621","00:44:25,957","Well, you look..."
551,"00:44:28,393","00:44:29,627",...terrible.
552,"00:44:31,362","00:44:32,497",Come here.
553,"00:45:10,134","00:45:11,402","Oh, uh, excuse me."
554,"00:45:11,436","00:45:13,604","Do you guys know
where Bagley Hall is?"
555,"00:46:39,190","00:46:41,359","- Hello?
- Hey."
556,"00:46:41,392","00:46:43,194",Hey. What's going on?
557,"00:46:43,227","00:46:44,763","Hardin, come back here!"
558,"00:47:01,847","00:47:04,282","Tess, wait. Don't hang up.
That was Iskra, my trainer."
559,"00:47:04,315","00:47:06,350","- I'm at the gym.
- I'm kicking his ass, Tess!"
560,"00:47:06,384","00:47:08,486",And he is not kicking my ass.
561,"00:47:08,519","00:47:10,822",I didn't mean to hang up.
562,"00:47:10,856","00:47:12,824","I think you did,
and I know exactly why,"
563,"00:47:12,858","00:47:16,494","'cause I would have
thought the same thing."
564,"00:47:16,527","00:47:19,363","Yeah, I'm a little relieved."
565,"00:47:19,397","00:47:21,532","It's nice,
showing Landon the ropes."
566,"00:47:23,134","00:47:24,535",Don't take all day.
567,"00:47:24,569","00:47:25,503","Okay, one minute."
568,"00:47:27,773","00:47:29,106","You okay, though?"
569,"00:47:29,140","00:47:31,576","Yeah, yeah, I'm fine."
570,"00:47:31,609","00:47:33,377","How was the drive down?
Was it not too long?"
571,"00:47:33,411","00:47:35,613","It was good, but when
you get in the city,"
572,"00:47:35,646","00:47:37,548",the traffic's terrible.
573,"00:47:37,582","00:47:39,851","It takes like 20 minutes
to go a mile."
574,"00:47:41,586","00:47:42,854",And Vance and Kimberly's?
575,"00:47:42,888","00:47:44,388","Yeah, yeah, it's great."
576,"00:47:44,422","00:47:46,457","The, um...
The place is amazing."
577,"00:47:46,490","00:47:48,359",It's like...
578,"00:47:48,392","00:47:50,595",It's huge. It's like a palace.
579,"00:47:50,628","00:47:51,730",Nice.
580,"00:47:52,898","00:47:55,499","I'm really glad, Tess."
581,"00:47:58,235","00:48:00,404","- I'm sorry I hurt you.
- You don't..."
582,"00:48:00,438","00:48:02,473","No, I..."
583,"00:48:04,275","00:48:05,911",I just want you to be happy.
584,"00:48:05,944","00:48:07,411",You deserve to be happy.
585,"00:48:09,580","00:48:11,182",It's cool that you're boxing.
586,"00:48:11,215","00:48:13,919","I know, right?
I really fucking like it."
587,"00:48:13,952","00:48:15,754","It's nice to be able
to punch people"
588,"00:48:15,787","00:48:17,288","and not have anyone
call the police."
589,"00:48:19,523","00:48:21,860","I think that
that's a step forward."
590,"00:48:23,494","00:48:24,896",Right?
591,"00:48:26,230","00:48:27,598",I'm trying a new approach.
592,"00:48:27,632","00:48:29,667","Hardin. This is not
leisure hour. Come on."
593,"00:48:29,700","00:48:32,370","I really have to go now,
but I'm so glad you called."
594,"00:48:32,403","00:48:34,438","Yeah. Yeah, me too."
595,"00:48:34,472","00:48:35,907",All right. We'll talk soon.
596,"00:48:35,941","00:48:38,275","- Bye, Tess.
- Bye."
597,"00:48:49,855","00:48:53,190","- Yes.
- He's a pretty boy."
598,"00:48:53,224","00:48:55,861","You scared to fight Landon?
You heard... Oh, shit!"
599,"00:48:55,894","00:48:57,528","Whoa, whoa, whoa!"
600,"00:49:07,839","00:49:09,908","Vance Publishing, please hold."
601,"00:49:15,981","00:49:17,983","Selfies, huh?"
602,"00:49:18,016","00:49:22,954","No, I was... I was just
showing Hardin my new office."
603,"00:49:22,988","00:49:24,622",Mm-hm.
604,"00:49:26,825","00:49:28,626",Seattle looks good on you.
605,"00:49:44,709","00:49:47,344",So how's it going?
606,"00:49:48,780","00:49:52,818","Fine. Yeah.
I mean, work, school."
607,"00:49:52,851","00:49:55,453","It's a lot, but it's fine."
608,"00:49:55,486","00:49:57,688",Give it time. You'll settle in.
609,"00:49:57,722","00:50:00,624","You'll find a place.
It's exciting."
610,"00:50:00,658","00:50:02,828","Are you sure
that you don't want a glass?"
611,"00:50:04,562","00:50:07,766","I think she might be
on to us, darling."
612,"00:50:07,799","00:50:13,004","Well, we have some news."
613,"00:50:13,038","00:50:14,840",We just found out...
614,"00:50:14,873","00:50:16,674",we're having a baby.
615,"00:50:16,707","00:50:20,311","Are you kidding?
I'm so happy for you guys."
616,"00:50:20,344","00:50:22,680","I'm gonna tell Hardin though,
if that's all right with you."
617,"00:50:22,713","00:50:24,015","Yeah, yeah, of course."
618,"00:50:24,049","00:50:25,716",Ken mentioned that he'd managed
619,"00:50:25,751","00:50:28,385",to get his GPA up to a 4.0.
620,"00:50:28,419","00:50:30,488","He must be looking forward
to graduating."
621,"00:50:30,521","00:50:35,426","Yeah, that's great.
Um, I didn't even know that."
622,"00:50:35,459","00:50:36,560",It's because of you.
623,"00:50:38,329","00:50:40,065","I mean,
I didn't write his papers."
624,"00:50:40,098","00:50:43,701","No, well...
Maybe not, I'm sure he did that."
625,"00:50:43,735","00:50:46,071","But, well, he has got
a gift, that boy."
626,"00:50:46,104","00:50:47,571",But he's stubborn as hell.
627,"00:50:47,605","00:50:48,840",You're one to talk.
628,"00:50:49,941","00:50:51,843",TouchÃ©.
629,"00:50:55,080","00:50:56,948","Well, I should get some sleep,"
630,"00:50:56,982","00:50:58,784","but I will see
you guys tomorrow?"
631,"00:50:58,817","00:51:00,752","Yeah, of course."
632,"00:51:00,786","00:51:02,854",And you should take this.
633,"00:51:02,888","00:51:04,823","It's too nice of a bottle
to go to waste."
634,"00:51:04,856","00:51:06,590","- Yes, please.
- Don't worry about me."
635,"00:51:06,624","00:51:07,993",I won't have any.
636,"00:51:08,026","00:51:10,561","- You don't need any more.
- Good night, darling."
637,"00:51:10,594","00:51:12,530","- Good night.
- You have to suffer like me."
638,"00:51:17,769","00:51:21,405","There you are.
I just got back from the gym."
639,"00:51:21,438","00:51:22,874",You did?
640,"00:51:22,908","00:51:27,611","Wow, you must be getting
pretty good."
641,"00:51:29,848","00:51:31,116",Are you drunk?
642,"00:51:31,149","00:51:33,384","I was hanging out
with Vance and Kimberly,"
643,"00:51:33,417","00:51:36,687","and she gave me
the rest of the bottle."
644,"00:51:36,720","00:51:37,856","Oh, yeah?"
645,"00:51:37,889","00:51:39,925",So how much wine have you had?
646,"00:51:39,958","00:51:43,061",I'm on my...
647,"00:51:43,094","00:51:44,562",third?
648,"00:51:44,595","00:51:49,734","You were actually
quite the topic."
649,"00:51:49,768","00:51:51,669","You didn't answer
my call earlier."
650,"00:51:51,702","00:51:55,539","No, I know. I've been at work
since, like, 8:00."
651,"00:51:55,573","00:51:57,042","Except for taking
office selfies."
652,"00:51:57,075","00:52:00,611","- Which you didn't respond to.
- Tessa."
653,"00:52:00,644","00:52:02,646",Hardin Allen Scott.
654,"00:52:04,481","00:52:05,750",Why are you laughing?
655,"00:52:05,784","00:52:08,019",It's just all so ridiculous.
656,"00:52:09,520","00:52:11,756","I think you need
to put that wine down."
657,"00:52:11,790","00:52:13,624",Make me.
658,"00:52:13,657","00:52:15,526","Well, I would if I was there."
659,"00:52:15,559","00:52:17,963",What else would you make me do?
660,"00:52:19,164","00:52:20,664","Theresa Lynn Young,"
661,"00:52:20,698","00:52:23,068","are you trying
to have phone sex with me?"
662,"00:52:25,203","00:52:27,739","Tell me what you would do
if you were here."
663,"00:52:29,506","00:52:32,710","- Are you lying in your bed?
- Mm-hm."
664,"00:52:32,744","00:52:34,112",Close your eyes.
665,"00:52:35,646","00:52:37,648","- Are they closed?
- Mm-hm."
666,"00:52:37,681","00:52:38,850",Are you sure?
667,"00:52:57,668","00:53:00,671","Fuck, I wish I was there
watching you right now."
668,"00:53:00,704","00:53:04,175","You like that, don't you?
Watching me?"
669,"00:53:05,676","00:53:07,178","Fuck, yeah, I do."
670,"00:53:12,751","00:53:13,818",How'd you sleep?
671,"00:53:15,153","00:53:16,187",Good.
672,"00:53:17,488","00:53:19,791",Not as good as I do with you.
673,"00:53:19,824","00:53:21,692",I know the feeling.
674,"00:53:23,962","00:53:27,665",Come here. I miss you.
675,"00:53:27,698","00:53:29,868",I miss you too.
676,"00:53:29,901","00:53:32,703","Don't say ""too."" It sounds like
you're just agreeing with me."
677,"00:53:38,109","00:53:40,211",I love you.
678,"00:53:40,245","00:53:41,846",I love you.
679,"00:54:08,539","00:54:11,109",Tessa? Tessa?
680,"00:54:12,643","00:54:16,181","Tess! No, no, no, Tessa! Tessa!"
681,"00:54:18,249","00:54:21,820",Tessa! Tessa!
682,"00:54:21,853","00:54:23,054",Tess!
683,"00:54:23,088","00:54:24,856","No, no, no!"
684,"00:54:29,294","00:54:31,196","- I love you.
- I love you too."
685,"00:54:33,865","00:54:36,034","Fuck you! No, no!"
686,"00:55:10,101","00:55:12,070","- Hi. Hi.
- Hi."
687,"00:55:14,705","00:55:17,075",What... What are you doing here?
688,"00:55:17,108","00:55:20,178","Well, I came to see you.
But I can leave."
689,"00:55:23,048","00:55:24,149",No.
690,"00:55:26,351","00:55:28,086","- I'm gonna get my bags.
- Mm-mm."
691,"00:55:33,892","00:55:35,794",Give us a hand.
692,"00:55:37,796","00:55:39,964","What's the fastest
train you've been on?"
693,"00:55:39,998","00:55:41,866","- There's this train in Japan.
- Oh, hey!"
694,"00:55:41,900","00:55:43,168","- Hey, hey.
- Hardin."
695,"00:55:43,201","00:55:44,335","Smith, what's up?"
696,"00:55:44,369","00:55:45,937","- How are you doing?
- Fine."
697,"00:55:45,970","00:55:47,272","He asked if he could stay,"
698,"00:55:47,305","00:55:49,874","and I thought you might
be all right with that."
699,"00:55:49,908","00:55:52,243","It's a lovely place.
Where should I drop my stuff?"
700,"00:55:52,277","00:55:53,978","- Uh, let me show you.
- Cool."
701,"00:55:54,012","00:55:55,880","I'll call you guys
when dinner's ready."
702,"00:55:55,914","00:55:58,249","- Sounds good.
- It's this way."
703,"00:55:58,283","00:56:00,717","It's nice to see
a smile back on her face."
704,"00:56:00,752","00:56:01,685",It is.
705,"00:56:08,226","00:56:10,995","So, um, I found this."
706,"00:56:12,197","00:56:13,697","And I'm really sorry,"
707,"00:56:13,731","00:56:16,034","but once I picked it up,
I couldn't put it down."
708,"00:56:24,075","00:56:27,145","You're a brilliant writer, Tess."
709,"00:56:27,178","00:56:29,347","And I came across
that page about pain"
710,"00:56:29,380","00:56:31,916",and I just wanted to apologize.
711,"00:56:31,950","00:56:33,952","The way I made you feel
is inexcusable."
712,"00:56:33,985","00:56:36,254",So I'm sorry.
713,"00:56:36,287","00:56:39,224","I didn't mean for you
to read any of this..."
714,"00:56:39,257","00:56:41,126","- I'm sure you didn't.
- It's pretty raw."
715,"00:56:42,327","00:56:43,828",I needed to hear it.
716,"00:56:45,163","00:56:46,764",In your words.
717,"00:56:46,798","00:56:49,801",And I fucking hate myself
718,"00:56:49,834","00:56:52,237","for making you feel that way,
but I'm sorry."
719,"00:56:56,808","00:56:58,910",Thank you.
720,"00:56:58,943","00:57:00,411",Hey! Steaks are on!
721,"00:57:03,481","00:57:05,016",Be right there!
722,"00:57:11,722","00:57:13,458",Oh.
723,"00:57:13,491","00:57:14,893",Will we?
724,"00:57:21,399","00:57:23,401",I love you too.
725,"00:57:26,037","00:57:28,306",We shouldn't keep them waiting.
726,"00:57:28,339","00:57:30,942","What? I mean,
I'm sure that they're fine."
727,"00:57:30,975","00:57:32,143","Come on, I'm hungry."
728,"00:57:39,250","00:57:41,419","He really wants me to go.
He keeps talking"
729,"00:57:41,452","00:57:43,988","about me wearing the hat
and the gown and everything."
730,"00:57:44,022","00:57:46,991","- What's so bad about that?
- It just looks ridiculous."
731,"00:57:47,025","00:57:49,227","Can you imagine me in the hat
and the gown and everything?"
732,"00:57:49,260","00:57:50,862","I don't even wanna go
to the ceremony."
733,"00:57:50,895","00:57:52,931","I can't imagine it,
but I really wanna see it."
734,"00:57:54,265","00:57:56,501","You gotta celebrate
your accomplishments."
735,"00:57:56,534","00:57:58,369","You don't wanna
look back and regret"
736,"00:57:58,403","00:58:00,838","having not had
those experiences."
737,"00:58:00,872","00:58:03,274","Trust me, I know firsthand."
738,"00:58:05,210","00:58:07,445","- I'll give it some thought.
- I think you should."
739,"00:58:09,047","00:58:10,448","- Hey, buddy.
- Hi."
740,"00:58:10,481","00:58:12,317","This needs turning,
do you wanna do it?"
741,"00:58:12,350","00:58:14,786","- Why not?
- Okay. There you go. Grab that."
742,"00:58:14,819","00:58:18,289","- This is really nice.
- Yeah."
743,"00:58:18,323","00:58:23,027","You know, all of us
together, under one roof."
744,"00:58:24,128","00:58:26,331","- Here we all are.
- Yeah."
745,"00:58:28,132","00:58:32,136","- Well, tonight, anyway.
- Oh, come on."
746,"00:58:32,170","00:58:34,472",You two will work it out.
747,"00:58:34,505","00:58:36,407","Sometimes distance is
a good thing."
748,"00:58:36,441","00:58:37,742",Mmm.
749,"00:58:38,876","00:58:39,844",You think so?
750,"00:58:41,479","00:58:43,147","Honestly, I have no idea."
751,"00:58:46,284","00:58:49,454","Look, relationships..."
752,"00:58:51,990","00:58:53,324",they're complicated.
753,"01:00:06,064","01:00:07,098",Hey.
754,"01:00:25,016","01:00:26,217",Did I do something?
755,"01:00:30,021","01:00:33,224","You've barely said a word to me
the whole night."
756,"01:00:47,038","01:00:49,440","I had this horrible dream
of you and Robert."
757,"01:00:52,410","01:00:55,413","I can't get it
out of my fucking head."
758,"01:01:01,419","01:01:04,021",But I'm here with you.
759,"01:01:07,725","01:01:09,460",That's exactly it.
760,"01:01:14,999","01:01:18,169","I can't help but think that
you should be with someone else."
761,"01:01:21,372","01:01:23,474","Your life would be
so much easier."
762,"01:01:29,347","01:01:30,681",There's all this bad shit
763,"01:01:30,715","01:01:33,084","that I've been trying
to suppress for so long."
764,"01:01:33,117","01:01:34,519",It's just all coming up.
765,"01:01:35,720","01:01:37,555",And there's nothing I can do.
766,"01:01:39,424","01:01:42,059","The thought of losing you
is just, heh..."
767,"01:01:42,093","01:01:44,162","It's pretty fucking dark
in here, Tess."
768,"01:01:50,301","01:01:52,069",Why didn't you just tell me?
769,"01:01:52,103","01:01:54,238","That's the whole point
of being open..."
770,"01:01:54,272","01:01:57,608","Because it's a burden for me,
and I don't wanna burden you."
771,"01:02:09,454","01:02:12,457","I don't want to be
with anyone else."
772,"01:02:14,592","01:02:16,294",I wanna be with you.
773,"01:02:20,498","01:02:21,599",Hey.
774,"01:02:47,058","01:02:49,494","Fuck me until
you forget about that dream."
775,"01:03:50,454","01:03:52,223","Oh, fuck."
776,"01:03:54,292","01:03:58,129",Look in the mirror.
777,"01:04:00,498","01:04:02,734","Oh, yes, baby."
778,"01:04:02,768","01:04:05,469","- You close?
- Yeah."
779,"01:04:45,744","01:04:47,712","We didn't
use protection last night."
780,"01:04:50,648","01:04:52,149","Yeah, I know."
781,"01:04:53,785","01:04:56,587","I'll have to go
to the drugstore tonight."
782,"01:04:56,621","01:04:58,723",I should get on the pill anyway.
783,"01:05:03,394","01:05:04,362",Yeah.
784,"01:05:05,764","01:05:08,332","Yeah, you with no condom,
on a regular basis,"
785,"01:05:08,366","01:05:09,868",that's gonna work for me.
786,"01:05:21,679","01:05:23,147",Here are the kids.
787,"01:05:27,218","01:05:28,519","Hey, hey."
788,"01:05:28,552","01:05:31,222","You look in better spirits
this morning."
789,"01:05:32,723","01:05:35,794","Yeah, think I just needed
a good night's sleep."
790,"01:05:39,865","01:05:41,733","Oh, it's Mom. One sec, guys."
791,"01:05:41,767","01:05:43,735","- Hi, Mom.
- Hi, my love."
792,"01:05:43,769","01:05:44,903",How are you doing?
793,"01:05:44,936","01:05:46,938","Good, thanks. How are you?"
794,"01:05:46,972","01:05:49,975",That must be about the wedding.
795,"01:05:50,008","01:05:51,375","Uh, whose wedding?"
796,"01:05:53,477","01:05:56,647","- Trish is...? Oh, my God.
- Yeah."
797,"01:05:56,681","01:05:58,750","- Yeah.
- Oh, that's amazing."
798,"01:05:58,784","01:06:00,651",She deserves it.
799,"01:06:00,685","01:06:05,556","Yeah. And Mike is a good guy.
So he'll look after her."
800,"01:06:05,589","01:06:07,658","- Okay, let's go.
- Oh!"
801,"01:06:07,692","01:06:09,727","- Okay.
- Come on, bud."
802,"01:06:11,362","01:06:12,563","- Smith.
- What?"
803,"01:06:12,596","01:06:13,765","Hey, hey, hey! Backpack."
804,"01:06:15,366","01:06:16,567",Hey.
805,"01:06:17,869","01:06:21,006","- Bye.
- Bye."
806,"01:06:21,039","01:06:23,674","I will, I will, I will.
All right."
807,"01:06:23,708","01:06:24,843",Bye.
808,"01:06:30,614","01:06:33,885",What? What?
809,"01:06:33,919","01:06:34,953",So?
810,"01:06:36,721","01:06:40,725","So, what do you wanna do today?"
811,"01:08:11,116","01:08:14,485","- Got everything?
- Yep."
812,"01:08:26,497","01:08:27,698",There's nothing...
813,"01:08:27,732","01:08:29,600","There's nothing
you've forgotten?"
814,"01:08:32,037","01:08:34,705","No, I think I'm good."
815,"01:08:38,810","01:08:41,913","What happened to our not keeping
secrets from each other?"
816,"01:08:41,947","01:08:44,648","- What are you on about?
- You're not gonna tell me"
817,"01:08:44,682","01:08:46,117",about your mom's wedding?
818,"01:08:47,618","01:08:48,552",Tess...
819,"01:08:50,454","01:08:51,957","the only reason
I haven't told you"
820,"01:08:51,990","01:08:54,558","- is because I don't want to go.
- Okay. Why..."
821,"01:08:54,592","01:08:56,061",Why don't you wanna go?
822,"01:08:56,094","01:08:58,395","I thought you wanted
to show me your hometown."
823,"01:08:58,429","01:09:03,168","I wanna show you London. I do
not wanna show you my hometown."
824,"01:09:03,201","01:09:05,569","If you don't wanna bring me,
I think that that's fine."
825,"01:09:05,603","01:09:07,705",But it's her big day.
826,"01:09:07,739","01:09:10,008","I really think
you need to be there for her."
827,"01:09:10,041","01:09:13,677","If I was going,
I would bring you, but..."
828,"01:09:13,711","01:09:15,747","Do you know what,
I'll think about it."
829,"01:09:15,780","01:09:18,149","- Okay?
- Okay."
830,"01:09:18,183","01:09:20,584","Hey, this was a good weekend."
831,"01:09:20,618","01:09:22,921","- How good?
- This good."
832,"01:09:25,190","01:09:27,158",Better.
833,"01:09:27,192","01:09:30,996","Can you come back on Wednesday?
Vance is having an event."
834,"01:09:32,931","01:09:34,498",I'll try.
835,"01:09:40,772","01:09:41,973",Okay.
836,"01:10:47,072","01:10:48,773",Richard?
837,"01:10:48,807","01:10:50,641","I nearly smashed
your fucking head in!"
838,"01:10:52,210","01:10:54,511","What the fuck are you thinking,
breaking in here?"
839,"01:10:54,545","01:10:57,048","You weren't here, and, uh..."
840,"01:10:57,082","01:10:59,516","Tess told me
where you keep the key."
841,"01:10:59,550","01:11:02,120",You look like shit.
842,"01:11:02,153","01:11:05,723","Yeah, well, uh, I owe a guy."
843,"01:11:05,757","01:11:08,259","- How much are you in for?
- Five hundred."
844,"01:11:29,848","01:11:30,815",You can take this.
845,"01:11:35,020","01:11:36,054",Here.
846,"01:11:38,589","01:11:40,657",My dad gave me that.
847,"01:11:40,691","01:11:41,725",I never wear it.
848,"01:11:43,261","01:11:45,696","It's worth a lot more
than what you need, so..."
849,"01:11:45,730","01:11:46,697",Thanks.
850,"01:11:47,999","01:11:49,834",Yeah.
851,"01:11:51,369","01:11:53,271",I'm gonna get better for her.
852,"01:11:56,141","01:11:57,175",I'm gonna get better.
853,"01:11:58,276","01:11:59,811",I promise.
854,"01:12:12,791","01:12:14,859","This should protect you
from pregnancy"
855,"01:12:14,893","01:12:16,928",for the next three months.
856,"01:12:16,961","01:12:19,197",My concern is...
857,"01:12:19,230","01:12:21,199",you may not need it.
858,"01:12:21,232","01:12:24,302",It's your cervix.
859,"01:12:24,335","01:12:26,738","You may not be able
to get pregnant."
860,"01:12:26,771","01:12:29,074","We need to do more tests
before we know."
861,"01:12:50,128","01:12:52,163",Hmm.
862,"01:12:52,197","01:12:53,798","As much as I'd like to help,"
863,"01:12:53,832","01:12:55,733","by the time you apply
for the transfer,"
864,"01:12:55,767","01:12:58,036","you register and start classes,"
865,"01:12:58,069","01:12:59,904","I don't think
it's worth the hassle."
866,"01:12:59,938","01:13:01,672","And I don't think
you're gonna get"
867,"01:13:01,705","01:13:03,174","the classes you need
to graduate."
868,"01:13:03,208","01:13:04,909","I figured
you were gonna say this."
869,"01:13:04,943","01:13:07,812","- Just thought I'd give it a try.
- It's only two months."
870,"01:13:07,846","01:13:10,248","And you know, it's been
one of my biggest dreams"
871,"01:13:10,281","01:13:13,084",to see you graduate.
872,"01:13:13,118","01:13:15,286","I guess it hasn't always
been a given, has it?"
873,"01:13:15,320","01:13:17,789","No, no. It hasn't."
874,"01:13:17,822","01:13:21,025","It has been a gift,
having you here."
875,"01:13:21,059","01:13:25,163","And I'm grateful that you were
willing to give me a chance"
876,"01:13:25,196","01:13:26,663",to see me sober.
877,"01:13:27,765","01:13:28,933",Yeah.
878,"01:13:31,169","01:13:32,170",When was that?
879,"01:13:33,438","01:13:36,074","Oh, that was freshman year."
880,"01:13:36,107","01:13:37,842","Your mom, Vance and I."
881,"01:13:39,310","01:13:40,845",Never seen it before.
882,"01:13:42,413","01:13:44,681",You know she's getting married.
883,"01:13:44,715","01:13:46,151","- To Mike?
- To Mike."
884,"01:13:46,184","01:13:49,120","Oh, good for her. He always
seemed like a nice guy."
885,"01:13:49,154","01:13:52,423","I've always thought he was a bit
of a wanker, but if she's happy."
886,"01:13:53,724","01:13:54,993",Two months!
887,"01:13:55,026","01:13:56,261",It's just gonna go like...
888,"01:14:28,860","01:14:30,962","- Hey!
- Hello."
889,"01:14:30,995","01:14:32,430",Don't you two look gorgeous.
890,"01:14:32,463","01:14:33,865",Obviously.
891,"01:14:36,434","01:14:38,970","Relax, it's soda water."
892,"01:14:39,003","01:14:41,873","- Did you tell him? Did...?
- Vance called me."
893,"01:14:41,906","01:14:45,243","- Oh.
- Well, enjoy."
894,"01:14:46,477","01:14:48,846","- I have to go play hostess.
- Okay."
895,"01:14:53,251","01:14:56,087","They were ecstatic when
I told them you were coming."
896,"01:14:56,120","01:14:57,288","What, just them?"
897,"01:14:58,823","01:15:02,160","Well, I was... I was happy."
898,"01:15:03,294","01:15:05,129",Um...
899,"01:15:05,163","01:15:07,298",I do have some bad news.
900,"01:15:07,332","01:15:08,733","Oh. Uh, what?"
901,"01:15:10,401","01:15:12,971","It's not looking like
I'm gonna be able to get here"
902,"01:15:13,004","01:15:15,773","- for another two months.
- What, uh...?"
903,"01:15:15,807","01:15:17,442","What do you mean, like visit?"
904,"01:15:17,475","01:15:19,310","Wait, what?"
905,"01:15:19,344","01:15:21,846",What? What do you mean?
906,"01:15:21,879","01:15:23,781","I mean, like, for good."
907,"01:15:26,251","01:15:29,821","Like... Uh, wait."
908,"01:15:29,854","01:15:32,924","- Do you mean like move here?
- It's two months, though."
909,"01:15:32,957","01:15:34,926","- I wonder if I should even...
- Are you serious?"
910,"01:15:34,959","01:15:37,895","Should I call the whole thing
off? Maybe I should cancel it."
911,"01:15:37,929","01:15:40,465","- I love you so much.
- I love you."
912,"01:15:42,567","01:15:47,038","Hate to break it up,
but I wanna dance!"
913,"01:15:47,071","01:15:48,906",Come on!
914,"01:15:48,940","01:15:50,842","How are you, my boy?"
915,"01:15:55,480","01:15:57,515","- There's my boy.
- Hey."
916,"01:15:57,548","01:16:00,585","- How are you?
- Never better."
917,"01:16:08,526","01:16:11,829","- I gotta go to work.
- Go ahead."
918,"01:17:24,369","01:17:27,638","- Let's go. Right now. Yeah?
- Mm-hm."
919,"01:17:37,648","01:17:39,417",You're moving here.
920,"01:17:42,720","01:17:44,689",Yeah.
921,"01:18:10,548","01:18:12,417",Right.
922,"01:18:12,450","01:18:15,319","- Your elbows are up again.
- Oh, man."
923,"01:18:15,353","01:18:16,554","All right, then."
924,"01:18:18,289","01:18:19,957","You looking forward
to visiting home?"
925,"01:18:19,991","01:18:21,259",I know I am.
926,"01:18:22,761","01:18:24,462","Oh, I see."
927,"01:18:24,495","01:18:27,365","Celebrating your mom's happiness
doesn't sound appealing?"
928,"01:18:27,398","01:18:29,567",It's not that.
929,"01:18:29,600","01:18:31,169","So, what's going on?"
930,"01:18:34,639","01:18:36,240","I really want to bring Tessa,"
931,"01:18:36,274","01:18:38,576","but I don't want to bring her
around my old life."
932,"01:18:38,609","01:18:40,445","It's just a sad house
in a sad place."
933,"01:18:45,016","01:18:48,386","Has she ever made you feel badly
about your past?"
934,"01:18:48,419","01:18:51,389","- No.
- The only way you can find out"
935,"01:18:51,422","01:18:55,092","if you trust her
is to trust her."
936,"01:18:55,126","01:18:57,662","And it'd mean the world to
Trish, having you both there."
937,"01:19:04,368","01:19:06,103","Look. Seriously, mate."
938,"01:19:08,206","01:19:11,542","Your wedding is
a moment that's..."
939,"01:19:13,377","01:19:16,647","bigger than anything else
that you can possibly imagine."
940,"01:19:16,681","01:19:19,450","- Kind of changes you.
- Mm-hm."
941,"01:19:19,484","01:19:21,352","And that's why
they all fail, right?"
942,"01:19:21,385","01:19:22,754",Not all of them.
943,"01:19:22,788","01:19:24,655",Not if you find the right one.
944,"01:19:26,825","01:19:30,161","You know, I believe"
945,"01:19:30,194","01:19:33,698","that you have
two real great loves."
946,"01:19:33,732","01:19:37,401","So in your case,
that would be Tessa and you."
947,"01:19:41,272","01:19:43,508",You gonna show me what you got?
948,"01:19:43,541","01:19:45,376","- Yeah. Come on, then.
- Aah!"
949,"01:20:02,560","01:20:04,529",I got us tickets to England.
950,"01:20:07,766","01:20:09,166",Mmm...
951,"01:20:26,852","01:20:29,453","- Keep the change.
- Don't worry, Mom. I'll get it."
952,"01:20:29,487","01:20:31,689","- No, no, no. I've got it.
- Hi."
953,"01:20:31,722","01:20:33,724","Oh, it's so good
to see you both."
954,"01:20:33,759","01:20:36,294","Jesus, Tessa.
Is there a body in there?"
955,"01:20:36,327","01:20:38,429","I didn't know
how much I'd need."
956,"01:20:38,462","01:20:39,798",Here you go.
957,"01:20:39,831","01:20:41,165",Thank you.
958,"01:20:41,198","01:20:42,700",How was the flight?
959,"01:20:42,734","01:20:44,468",Sorry it's not more comfortable.
960,"01:20:44,502","01:20:47,271","I didn't expect the house
to sell on the first day."
961,"01:20:47,305","01:20:49,140","No, it's great."
962,"01:20:49,173","01:20:50,809","I left your bed up, Hardin."
963,"01:20:52,476","01:20:54,612","I wasn't expecting
to sleep on the floor."
964,"01:20:55,847","01:20:58,349",It's perfect. Thank you.
965,"01:20:58,382","01:20:59,851","Well, you guys
must be exhausted."
966,"01:20:59,885","01:21:01,452",So I'll leave you to it.
967,"01:21:01,485","01:21:04,155",I'm staying next door at Mike's.
968,"01:21:04,188","01:21:05,289",Okay.
969,"01:21:07,793","01:21:09,627","Hey, give me a sec..."
970,"01:21:09,660","01:21:12,630","- We're really happy for you.
- Thank you."
971,"01:21:12,663","01:21:14,800",I'm glad you came.
972,"01:21:14,833","01:21:17,234","I've gotta go to
the bridal store in the morning."
973,"01:21:17,268","01:21:18,804","I was wondering,
do you wanna come?"
974,"01:21:18,837","01:21:22,506","- Yeah, I'd love to. That's...
- Great. Great."
975,"01:21:22,540","01:21:24,308","- Call me if you need me.
- Okay."
976,"01:21:24,342","01:21:25,476","- Bye.
- Bye."
977,"01:21:28,780","01:21:31,449","Don't take any of my stuff
or go in my room,"
978,"01:21:31,482","01:21:33,417","and definitely don't have
any friends over, okay?"
979,"01:21:33,451","01:21:36,253","Yeah, yeah.
Hey, thanks for letting me stay here."
980,"01:21:36,287","01:21:38,489","Yeah, well, don't thank me,
because it's not permanent."
981,"01:21:38,522","01:21:39,825","Yeah, yeah. I know."
982,"01:21:39,858","01:21:41,793","Make sure you call
if there's a problem."
983,"01:21:41,827","01:21:43,862","Sure thing, Hardin. Bye."
984,"01:21:48,532","01:21:50,601",Who was that?
985,"01:21:50,635","01:21:52,470",That was a random homeless man
986,"01:21:52,503","01:21:54,438","who I've been letting sleep
on my couch."
987,"01:21:54,472","01:21:56,775","All the hipsters
are doing it these days."
988,"01:22:01,278","01:22:03,681","- Thank you.
- Of course."
989,"01:22:17,996","01:22:20,431","- There's nothing to eat.
- What are you looking for?"
990,"01:22:20,464","01:22:22,266",I don't know. Something edible.
991,"01:22:22,299","01:22:24,736","That I don't have to cook,
preferably."
992,"01:22:24,770","01:22:27,605","Look, why don't you take
the keys and go to Sainsbury's."
993,"01:22:27,638","01:22:30,207","It'll give you something to do
when we're gone."
994,"01:22:31,409","01:22:32,410",Hi.
995,"01:22:32,443","01:22:33,779","- You ready?
- Yep."
996,"01:22:37,949","01:22:39,717","Are you sure
you're not jet-lagged?"
997,"01:22:39,751","01:22:41,519","- I feel fine.
- You don't have to go, you know."
998,"01:22:41,552","01:22:42,486",Hardin.
999,"01:22:45,423","01:22:47,793","Come on, Tessa. Let's do this."
1000,"01:23:23,494","01:23:25,563","I really shouldn't. I'm sorry,
guys. Have one for me."
1001,"01:23:25,596","01:23:26,965","Hey, man. Come on. Man."
1002,"01:23:36,742","01:23:39,243",Yep. That's it.
1003,"01:23:45,382","01:23:47,485",You really look amazing.
1004,"01:23:49,487","01:23:51,589",It's beginning to feel real.
1005,"01:23:55,526","01:23:56,962",What's her dress like?
1006,"01:23:58,395","01:24:01,465","Mmm...
I can't tell you."
1007,"01:24:02,934","01:24:04,668","You're seriously
not gonna tell me?"
1008,"01:24:04,702","01:24:05,971","Yeah, I can't tell you."
1009,"01:24:06,004","01:24:08,039","You're gonna
have to wait and see."
1010,"01:24:10,608","01:24:12,476",Don't care that much anyway.
1011,"01:24:17,115","01:24:19,483",Please tell me.
1012,"01:24:19,517","01:24:21,418","No, I won't tell you."
1013,"01:24:27,424","01:24:28,860",I'm so glad you came.
1014,"01:24:30,996","01:24:33,765","You're my better place, Tess."
1015,"01:25:24,715","01:25:26,885","- What the fuck?!
- Oh, fu...!"
1016,"01:25:26,918","01:25:30,755",Vance! Fucking hell!
1017,"01:25:30,789","01:25:34,491","- It's not what you think.
- Are you fucking kidding me?"
1018,"01:25:34,525","01:25:36,928","Well, it clearly fucking is!"
1019,"01:25:36,962","01:25:38,629",You're getting married tomorrow.
1020,"01:25:38,662","01:25:41,498",What the fuck is wrong with you?
1021,"01:25:41,532","01:25:43,001","The love of your life,
Kimberly,"
1022,"01:25:43,034","01:25:45,070","is carrying your child
while you're here..."
1023,"01:25:45,103","01:25:46,905","- That's enough!
- What is wrong with you?"
1024,"01:25:46,938","01:25:48,639",Hardin?
1025,"01:25:48,672","01:25:50,075","- Vance?
- Yeah."
1026,"01:25:50,108","01:25:51,709",He's been fucking my mom!
1027,"01:25:51,743","01:25:53,544","Please, Hardin, just stop it!"
1028,"01:25:53,577","01:25:55,747","Don't yell at me. You don't
get to tell me what to do."
1029,"01:25:55,780","01:25:58,116","You were getting fucked
on the counter like a slag."
1030,"01:25:58,149","01:25:59,751","Don't you talk to your mom
like that."
1031,"01:25:59,784","01:26:01,418","- Oh, fuck off!
- Hey."
1032,"01:26:01,452","01:26:03,654","Who the fuck are you
to tell me what to do, huh?"
1033,"01:26:03,687","01:26:05,489","- You really want to know?
- No, Christian, don't."
1034,"01:26:05,522","01:26:07,591","- Enough, Hardin!
- Stop, stop."
1035,"01:26:07,625","01:26:10,561","- Hardin, please stop it!
- Stop it! Ugh!"
1036,"01:26:10,594","01:26:12,563","Please, Hardin."
1037,"01:26:12,596","01:26:14,900","Hardin, that's enough!"
1038,"01:26:14,933","01:26:16,134",That's enough!
1039,"01:26:17,601","01:26:21,106",Enough. That's enough.
1040,"01:26:21,139","01:26:23,942","You're getting married tomorrow.
Did you forget?"
1041,"01:26:25,676","01:26:28,747","Who the fuck does that?
What are you going to tell Mike?"
1042,"01:26:28,780","01:26:31,917","Hardin, Christian and I..."
1043,"01:26:31,950","01:26:33,417","- He's...
- What?"
1044,"01:26:38,056","01:26:39,991",It's not that simple.
1045,"01:26:48,599","01:26:50,168","Okay, let's go."
1046,"01:26:50,201","01:26:51,736","- Tessa, don't.
- Let's go."
1047,"01:26:57,275","01:26:59,543",Are you all right?
1048,"01:27:27,806","01:27:29,240",Can you...?
1049,"01:27:45,290","01:27:48,559",It's okay. It's okay.
1050,"01:27:48,592","01:27:51,129",It is not okay.
1051,"01:27:51,162","01:27:53,164",It's not okay.
1052,"01:28:07,245","01:28:11,783","- Please, don't ever let me go.
- I won't. I'll never let you go."
1053,"01:28:21,725","01:28:25,864","That even though
you're a superhero in my eyes,"
1054,"01:28:25,897","01:28:27,899",you are still human.
1055,"01:28:29,633","01:28:33,238","Mike Richards,
do you take Trish Daniels"
1056,"01:28:33,271","01:28:35,639",for better or worse?
1057,"01:28:38,309","01:28:39,543",I do.
1058,"01:28:43,114","01:28:44,749",I really do.
1059,"01:28:49,054","01:28:52,791","I'm happy to pronounce
you husband and wife."
1060,"01:29:22,686","01:29:24,355","- Hardin...
- I have nothing to say to you."
1061,"01:29:24,389","01:29:26,391","- Come on.
- Get the fuck off me!"
1062,"01:29:26,424","01:29:28,827","Do you wanna go again, old man?"
1063,"01:29:28,860","01:29:31,062","If that's what it takes, yeah."
1064,"01:29:33,164","01:29:37,368","- There's a bar in the hotel.
- A fucking bar?"
1065,"01:29:37,402","01:29:38,837",It's just down the street.
1066,"01:29:40,704","01:29:42,340",I'll wait there for you.
1067,"01:29:57,088","01:29:59,090",I can come if you want me to.
1068,"01:30:01,993","01:30:04,896","But either way,
I think you should go."
1069,"01:30:07,298","01:30:09,700","She looks like
she doesn't need telling."
1070,"01:30:09,734","01:30:11,769",Yeah. She definitely knows.
1071,"01:30:13,972","01:30:16,707","I'm gonna go sit with her,
but if anything goes wrong,"
1072,"01:30:16,741","01:30:18,276",just come find me.
1073,"01:30:33,758","01:30:36,995",I'm surprised to see you here.
1074,"01:30:37,028","01:30:38,229",Yeah.
1075,"01:30:42,800","01:30:47,138","I'm afraid I won't be able
to stay as angry as I am."
1076,"01:30:49,007","01:30:50,842","Trust me, I am."
1077,"01:30:56,981","01:31:00,885",But what do I do? I love him.
1078,"01:31:00,919","01:31:04,923","And I love the life we're
building, and I love Smith."
1079,"01:31:19,003","01:31:21,005","You wanted to talk, let's talk."
1080,"01:31:28,880","01:31:31,349",I know you feel betrayed.
1081,"01:31:31,382","01:31:33,785",I want to explain myself.
1082,"01:31:33,818","01:31:36,120","But I honestly don't know
where to begin."
1083,"01:31:40,091","01:31:42,961","- I guess that makes us done then.
- Look, listen."
1084,"01:31:45,496","01:31:47,498","You are so important
to me and your mom."
1085,"01:31:47,532","01:31:49,534",Are you serious?
1086,"01:31:49,567","01:31:52,203","Now you two want to play
some sort of united front?"
1087,"01:31:52,237","01:31:54,472","- Fuck off with that.
- You wouldn't be so angry"
1088,"01:31:54,505","01:31:56,140",if you didn't care.
1089,"01:31:58,076","01:32:01,879","You know, I wish I could say
I'm surprised..."
1090,"01:32:04,015","01:32:05,350",but I'm not.
1091,"01:32:07,252","01:32:09,120",They have a history together.
1092,"01:32:11,422","01:32:14,192","One that I'm not sure
I can compete with."
1093,"01:32:17,395","01:32:21,032","I was gonna tell you ages ago,
but your mom didn't want..."
1094,"01:32:23,568","01:32:25,169",Tell me what?
1095,"01:32:28,039","01:32:29,274",Tell me what?
1096,"01:32:41,452","01:32:44,122",Hardin is Christian's son.
1097,"01:32:56,501","01:32:58,102",Fuck!
1098,"01:32:58,136","01:33:02,206","- You... What the fuck!
- I'm so sorry."
1099,"01:33:02,240","01:33:03,841",No!
1100,"01:33:18,389","01:33:19,891",I'm sorry.
1101,"01:33:21,492","01:33:23,094",I have to go.
