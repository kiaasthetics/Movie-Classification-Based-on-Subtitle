THE COMPLETE POEMS"
2,"00:00:51,720","00:00:53,000","Noah, are you ready?"
3,"00:01:34,080","00:01:36,280","My
Fault"
4,"00:02:10,400","00:02:11,560",What are you reading?

PRIDE AND PREJUDICE"
6,"00:02:14,680","00:02:17,120",Just tell me. I'm not wearing my glasses.
7,"00:02:20,160","00:02:21,840",You're not going to talk to me?
8,"00:02:24,560","00:02:26,160",This isn't easy for me either.
9,"00:02:26,920","00:02:29,760","You spend your life
trying to get to the next level,"
10,"00:02:29,840","00:02:33,000","but the same monster
keeps getting in your way."
11,"00:02:33,080","00:02:35,760","But one day,
when you've run out of hit points,"
12,"00:02:35,840","00:02:39,520","you're given
an extra chance at life, just like that."
13,"00:02:39,600","00:02:42,400","Mom, enough video game metaphors.
I'm not ten."
14,"00:02:42,480","00:02:46,160","Well, it's like opening a new book
and a new story begins. Better?"
15,"00:02:46,680","00:02:50,680","Damn it, Noah. Now we'll be
the main characters of our own lives."
16,"00:02:50,760","00:02:52,680","Your life. Mine's 1,000 km away."
17,"00:02:52,760","00:02:55,200","Now I'm all by myself
just for a fucking whim."
18,"00:02:55,280","00:02:58,160","- Will and I love each other.
- Don't want to hear it."
19,"00:02:58,240","00:02:59,600","Well, we love each other."
20,"00:02:59,680","00:03:01,680","I love somebody too
and you didn't care."
21,"00:03:01,760","00:03:04,520","I didn't want to keep you
from Dan and your friends."
22,"00:03:05,480","00:03:07,080","Noah, you're 17."
23,"00:03:07,800","00:03:10,320","I'm sure you'll make friends
being this nice."
24,"00:03:10,400","00:03:11,520",I'm not in the mood.
25,"00:03:11,600","00:03:14,160","Honey, St. Marie is a good school."
26,"00:03:14,240","00:03:16,080",It has a great volleyball team.
27,"00:03:16,160","00:03:18,960","- You'll be the captain in no time.
- Don't you get it?"
28,"00:03:19,040","00:03:22,240","I don't wanna go to a fancy school
a stranger is paying for."
29,"00:03:22,320","00:03:24,520","He's not a stranger, he's my husband."
30,"00:03:25,040","00:03:26,280",So get used to it.
31,"00:03:55,360","00:03:56,360","Hi, Manuel!"
32,"00:04:09,680","00:04:10,920","Will, honey!"
33,"00:04:11,000","00:04:12,200",Hi.
34,"00:04:14,360","00:04:15,760",How was the trip?
35,"00:04:15,840","00:04:17,560",I'll tell you later.
36,"00:04:20,360","00:04:21,600","Please, miss."
37,"00:04:21,680","00:04:23,960","- I can do it, thanks.
- It is my duty."
38,"00:04:24,040","00:04:25,880","- Allow me. Allow me, miss.
- No."
39,"00:04:25,960","00:04:27,320","- I can do it!
- Allow me."
40,"00:04:27,400","00:04:28,640",Let Martín help you.
41,"00:04:28,720","00:04:30,200",Let me take the suitcase!
42,"00:04:31,440","00:04:32,960","You win, Mortimer."
43,"00:04:34,520","00:04:38,400","- I'm so happy to see you, Noah.
- I can't say the same, I'm sorry."
44,"00:04:38,920","00:04:43,560","Well, I just want you to feel at home
and for you to consider me your family."
45,"00:04:43,640","00:04:44,720",At some point.
46,"00:04:44,800","00:04:46,640",Why don't we show you around?
47,"00:04:48,920","00:04:50,080",Take it easy.
48,"00:04:50,960","00:04:52,720","- Good morning.
- Ma'am."
49,"00:04:54,200","00:04:55,480","All right, sir."
50,"00:04:58,560","00:05:02,480","This is the hallway, that's the kitchen,
the bedrooms are upstairs."
51,"00:05:10,560","00:05:13,640","- This is the spa.
- And the gym."
52,"00:05:17,000","00:05:19,440",This saves you quite a few maneuvers!
53,"00:05:19,520","00:05:21,000",Don't you have a library?
54,"00:05:22,000","00:05:25,600","Or a guest room
where I can be alone and rest for a while?"
55,"00:05:45,240","00:05:47,000",Your favorite colors.
56,"00:05:47,080","00:05:50,240","A decorator helped me,
but I chose most of it."
57,"00:05:51,600","00:05:53,240",I don't know what to say.
58,"00:05:53,320","00:05:57,120","I wanted you to have what
you always wanted but I couldn't give you."
59,"00:05:57,800","00:05:58,800",It's amazing.
60,"00:06:00,480","00:06:02,960","- Thanks.
- You deserve it, sweetie."
61,"00:06:07,360","00:06:08,640","Okay, Mom."
62,"00:06:09,520","00:06:11,120",And it's not a guest room.
63,"00:06:12,680","00:06:13,680",I'm sorry.
64,"00:06:13,760","00:06:16,360","In fact, Nicholas' room is next door."
65,"00:06:16,440","00:06:21,240","Oh, right, Nick.
Daddy's boy, the perfect son... How cool."
66,"00:06:21,320","00:06:22,320",Listen to me.
67,"00:06:22,880","00:06:25,600","As perfect as he may be,
he's your stepbrother now."
68,"00:06:25,680","00:06:27,920","You have the same right
to be in this house."
69,"00:06:28,000","00:06:30,240",You know I'll never see it like that.
70,"00:06:30,320","00:06:34,120","And I won't stop
until you see this as it is, our home."
71,"00:06:36,480","00:06:37,720",Now unpack.
72,"00:07:04,200","00:07:05,520",This is obscene.
73,"00:07:35,680","00:07:36,680",Very funny.
74,"00:07:36,760","00:07:39,240",The ringtone you had was so dull.
75,"00:07:39,320","00:07:41,080","- How do I change it?
- Don't!"
76,"00:07:41,160","00:07:42,600",I want you to hate me.
77,"00:07:42,680","00:07:43,760",Hate you?
78,"00:07:43,840","00:07:46,520","I don't want you to bug me
about how you miss me."
79,"00:07:46,600","00:07:49,080","Well, suck it up,
because I miss you already."
80,"00:07:49,160","00:07:52,160","Well, I hate you. I'm so jealous.
That dressing room!"
81,"00:07:52,240","00:07:54,680","I'm not going to wear
any of those dresses."
82,"00:07:54,760","00:07:56,280",Are you crazy? Enjoy it!
83,"00:07:56,360","00:07:58,280",I can't stand all this extravagance.
84,"00:07:58,360","00:08:01,080",The house smells like poodle perfume.
85,"00:08:01,160","00:08:05,360","Can you picture me in the spa cuddling up
to one of those pompoms on legs?"
86,"00:08:05,440","00:08:08,080","So I have to feel sorry for you
for being rich?"
87,"00:08:08,160","00:08:10,920","Today it's family dinner
at the sailing club."
88,"00:08:11,000","00:08:12,320",I'll puke overboard.
89,"00:08:12,400","00:08:15,800","Look, his great-grandfather
was an English admiral."
90,"00:08:15,880","00:08:17,680",Enough to make you puke again.
91,"00:08:17,760","00:08:20,800","- Post millions of photos, please.
- Yes, I will."
92,"00:08:20,880","00:08:23,120",I didn't eat anything and I'm starving.
93,"00:08:23,200","00:08:24,800",Why don't you ask your butler?
94,"00:08:24,880","00:08:28,000","I bet these people
don't even have a lousy sandwich."
95,"00:08:30,160","00:08:33,400","Just as I expected,
not one goddamn sandwich."
96,"00:08:35,240","00:08:36,400",Shit!
97,"00:08:37,000","00:08:39,520",You must be my dad's new wife's daughter.
98,"00:08:39,600","00:08:43,560","How about an Angus ragout?
Some ramen? An apple strudel?"
99,"00:08:44,360","00:08:48,000","Don't know what you eat in Yokel-land,
but if you're gonna throw it up..."
100,"00:08:48,760","00:08:52,240","- Nicholas, right?
- That's right. And you are?"
101,"00:08:52,800","00:08:54,520","- Seriously?
- Are you still there?"
102,"00:08:54,600","00:08:55,760","- Noah?
- Noah?"
103,"00:08:56,800","00:08:58,080",Isn't that a boy's name?
104,"00:08:58,640","00:09:01,760","Your limited vocabulary
doesn't include the word ""unisex""?"
105,"00:09:04,160","00:09:07,440","Do you know what Thor's favorite word
from my vocabulary is?"
106,"00:09:08,320","00:09:09,600","It starts with ""a,"""
107,"00:09:10,880","00:09:12,480","then ""tta,"""
108,"00:09:13,160","00:09:14,480","and ends with ""ck."""
109,"00:09:14,560","00:09:16,960","- It's not funny.
- He doesn't like you."
110,"00:09:17,040","00:09:19,920","He must think
you snuck in without permission."
111,"00:09:20,000","00:09:21,560","But that's not true, is it?"
112,"00:09:21,640","00:09:23,400","That's enough, Nicholas!"
113,"00:09:23,480","00:09:25,560","He's like a poodle, but smarter."
114,"00:09:25,640","00:09:27,840","Did you hit your head as a baby, you jerk?"
115,"00:09:29,160","00:09:31,320",Thor hates it when people insult me.
116,"00:09:33,720","00:09:36,000","- Relax!
- Say something, damn it!"
117,"00:09:36,080","00:09:37,600","Thor, stop."
118,"00:09:38,960","00:09:41,600","- What are you doing?
- Seriously, or I'll hit you."
119,"00:09:41,680","00:09:44,560","If he senses a threat,
he'll rip you to shreds."
120,"00:09:44,640","00:09:47,480","- You'll still get a pan in the head.
- Thor, sit!"
121,"00:09:49,760","00:09:51,640","You're crazy, aren't you?"
122,"00:09:54,880","00:09:58,920","By the way, from a distance,
I couldn't see your freckles, sis."
123,"00:09:59,000","00:10:01,400",I'm not your sister nor anything like it.
124,"00:10:01,480","00:10:03,720",Hey! I see you've already met.
125,"00:10:03,800","00:10:07,280","Oh, yes, Nick is very nice.
But I like Thor best."
126,"00:10:07,360","00:10:08,640","Right, cutie? Come here."
127,"00:10:09,200","00:10:10,840","Come here, little guy! Hey!"
128,"00:10:11,680","00:10:14,240","I don't know what's wrong.
I must scare him."
129,"00:10:23,960","00:10:25,640",That was awesome!
130,"00:10:27,280","00:10:28,120",Betty?
131,"00:10:28,200","00:10:30,840","- You're still there?
- My God, your stepbrother!"
132,"00:10:30,920","00:10:33,240",Was that the sweet boy your mom mentioned?
133,"00:10:33,320","00:10:34,880",You see? A total dick.
134,"00:10:34,960","00:10:35,960","Is he hot, though?"
135,"00:10:36,480","00:10:38,720",So you're a gossip and a pervert.
136,"00:10:38,800","00:10:40,560","So he's a total hottie, then?"
137,"00:10:40,640","00:10:43,160",I don't know. I didn't really look at him.
138,"00:10:47,680","00:10:51,640","I don't mind the lack of punctuality,
but this dinner is bad timing."
139,"00:10:51,720","00:10:53,600","I'm sorry, it's not negotiable."
140,"00:10:54,440","00:10:58,160","She must be choosing a dress.
We went overboard in the store."
141,"00:10:58,240","00:10:59,720","Right, sweetie?"
142,"00:11:09,400","00:11:10,880","You look stunning, Noah."
143,"00:11:14,360","00:11:15,480",Let's go.
144,"00:11:23,240","00:11:24,960",Why don't you take a picture?
145,"00:11:29,520","00:11:31,080","Next time, you're driving."
146,"00:11:31,160","00:11:35,120","Should I change the music?
Maybe she likes something more... Right?"
147,"00:11:35,200","00:11:37,120","You're riding shotgun, you choose."
148,"00:11:37,200","00:11:38,760",CALL ME WHEN YOU GET THIS
149,"00:11:38,840","00:11:41,320","- Is the temperature okay?
- Yes, don't turn it up."
150,"00:11:41,400","00:11:43,000",No? You like it cool?
151,"00:11:43,080","00:11:44,760","- Hands on the wheel.
- No..."
152,"00:11:44,840","00:11:46,400","On the wheel, please!"
153,"00:11:46,480","00:11:48,480","\an8I'LL CALL YOU LATER.
GOTTA GO. LOVE YOU"
154,"00:11:48,560","00:11:50,880","- It's a straight road.
- You smell great."
155,"00:12:14,520","00:12:17,240","- 7654. Nick.
- There's Nick."
156,"00:12:17,880","00:12:20,800","Noah, your membership card
will arrive next week."
157,"00:12:20,880","00:12:22,880","Meanwhile, you can use my surname."
158,"00:12:22,960","00:12:26,120","- Won't that be confusing?
- Why would it be?"
159,"00:12:26,200","00:12:27,240","Hello, Mr. Leister."
160,"00:12:27,320","00:12:30,000",Hi. I'm Mrs. Leister. Noah Leister.
161,"00:12:30,080","00:12:32,200","Congratulations, sir. I did hear rumors."
162,"00:12:32,280","00:12:35,280","No, Antonio, no. I'm not that kind of guy."
163,"00:12:35,960","00:12:37,600",This is Mrs. Leister.
164,"00:12:38,320","00:12:41,760","- I'm sorry, how silly of me.
- Don't worry. It wasn't your fault."
165,"00:12:41,840","00:12:42,840",Come on.
166,"00:12:51,440","00:12:57,400","Summer has never been my favorite season,
but with this sea, the sunsets, you..."
167,"00:12:57,480","00:12:58,880",This city amazes me.
168,"00:12:59,720","00:13:04,160","Ranked as one of the most charming places
in the world by National Geographic."
169,"00:13:04,240","00:13:06,280",Thanks to our lobbying.
170,"00:13:06,360","00:13:09,320","Are there a lot
of forest fires around here?"
171,"00:13:09,400","00:13:12,280","Yes, Noah, unfortunately,
it's a blight on our city."
172,"00:13:12,360","00:13:14,560",There have been two already this summer.
173,"00:13:14,640","00:13:17,920","I don't get people
who throw cigarette butts out the window."
174,"00:13:19,360","00:13:21,600","Ever had points
deducted from your license?"
175,"00:13:21,680","00:13:24,200",For doing that? Impossible.
176,"00:13:24,280","00:13:25,440",Nick doesn't smoke.
177,"00:13:25,520","00:13:27,640","He's an athlete. Surfing champion, right?"
178,"00:13:27,720","00:13:29,760","- Yes.
- Surfing?"
179,"00:13:29,840","00:13:31,040",Is there a problem?
180,"00:13:31,120","00:13:34,880","No, I just prefer
team and strategic sports."
181,"00:13:34,960","00:13:37,120",Where you have to use your intelligence.
182,"00:13:39,280","00:13:41,480","If you'll excuse me, I have to go to work."
183,"00:13:41,560","00:13:42,960","- At Mikel's?
- Yes."
184,"00:13:43,040","00:13:44,560","- Your first case?
- I wish."
185,"00:13:44,640","00:13:47,240","His dad asked us
to take care of the paperwork."
186,"00:13:47,960","00:13:50,080","He studies law, and gets great grades."
187,"00:13:50,160","00:13:52,720","But it's all strength of mind,
no intelligence."
188,"00:13:52,800","00:13:55,760","Don't worry, if you're fired
from Mikel's dad's firm,"
189,"00:13:55,840","00:13:57,320",you'll still have your dad's.
190,"00:13:57,400","00:14:00,880","There'll always be
a Leister Enterprises subsidiary to milk."
191,"00:14:00,960","00:14:02,440","- Right, Nick?
- Noah, please."
192,"00:14:02,520","00:14:03,520",It's fine.
193,"00:14:04,040","00:14:05,960",My evening was going to be dull...
194,"00:14:06,040","00:14:08,280",Now we'll have something to laugh about.
195,"00:14:11,760","00:14:13,440","See you later, sis."
196,"00:14:15,960","00:14:17,960","- I'm leaving too.
- You're staying."
197,"00:14:18,040","00:14:19,240","No, wait. Nick."
198,"00:14:19,320","00:14:21,800","Can you take her home?
Isn't it on the way?"
199,"00:14:21,880","00:14:23,680","Not really, it's quite the detour."
200,"00:14:23,760","00:14:26,240","- I'd rather take a taxi.
- That's enough."
201,"00:14:26,320","00:14:28,800",We won't tolerate this attitude.
202,"00:14:28,880","00:14:31,280","- It's best if you get along.
- Will's right."
203,"00:14:31,360","00:14:34,280","Go with Nick, don't worry.
He's a careful driver."
204,"00:14:41,520","00:14:44,000","- What are you doing?
- What's your problem now?"
205,"00:14:44,080","00:14:47,080","I don't want to die
because of a lunatic who can't drive."
206,"00:14:47,160","00:14:50,040","- You think you could do better?
- Wanna bet?"
207,"00:14:50,120","00:14:53,400","You're in my house, in my city,
and my car, so shut up."
208,"00:14:53,480","00:14:56,240","Just because you own things
you think you're gods."
209,"00:14:56,320","00:15:01,360","Well, you're in my personal space,
my comfort zone, and my sight, so go away!"
210,"00:15:01,440","00:15:04,120","Your mom must love you
a lot to put up with you."
211,"00:15:04,200","00:15:06,680",What would you know about a mother's love?
212,"00:15:10,040","00:15:11,640","- What are you doing?
- Get out."
213,"00:15:11,720","00:15:15,360","- Why? What did I say?
- Get out or I'll get you out myself."
214,"00:15:15,440","00:15:17,120",You wouldn't dare.
215,"00:15:17,640","00:15:19,960",Nick!
216,"00:15:20,480","00:15:21,880",What is he doing?
217,"00:15:21,960","00:15:23,960","No way, no."
218,"00:15:24,040","00:15:25,040",Nicholas!
219,"00:15:25,080","00:15:26,920","Nick, let go of me!"
220,"00:15:27,000","00:15:29,320","- What are you doing?
- Call that taxi."
221,"00:15:29,400","00:15:31,640","- No taxi will pick me up here.
- Uber, then."
222,"00:15:32,640","00:15:33,640",Nick!
223,"00:15:34,240","00:15:35,520",Nick!
224,"00:15:36,400","00:15:40,040","Nick, seriously? You're not even going
to give me a safety vest?"
225,"00:15:40,840","00:15:42,840",This can't be happening to me.
226,"00:15:44,000","00:15:49,080","And now I'm out of battery. God damn...
Fuck! That asshole!"
227,"00:15:50,680","00:15:51,960",Fuck.
228,"00:16:04,840","00:16:06,040",Come on...
229,"00:16:06,120","00:16:09,520","Fine, don't stop.
I bet you're a serial killer."
230,"00:16:09,600","00:16:11,200",I dodged a bullet there.
231,"00:16:17,320","00:16:18,560",Shit.
232,"00:16:20,880","00:16:23,480","- Hey, are you okay?
- Yeah."
233,"00:16:23,560","00:16:25,800",Some jerk left me stranded here.
234,"00:16:25,880","00:16:27,880","All alone, in the middle of nowhere?"
235,"00:16:28,600","00:16:31,360","Yes, all alone, in the middle of nowhere."
236,"00:16:31,440","00:16:33,600","- All right, bye.
- No, hey!"
237,"00:16:33,680","00:16:37,040","Wait. Okay, I know that sounded bad."
238,"00:16:37,120","00:16:40,960","But it's true. I can't leave you
all alone in the middle of nowhere."
239,"00:16:41,840","00:16:43,560","Okay, that sounds better."
240,"00:16:44,960","00:16:47,000",Do you have an iPhone charger?
241,"00:16:48,320","00:16:52,240","What a day. I couldn't even take
my charger out of my suitcase."
242,"00:16:52,320","00:16:53,480",So...
243,"00:16:54,280","00:16:56,960","- Where am I taking you?
- Where are you headed?"
244,"00:16:57,520","00:17:00,320",To some random party at a villa out here.
245,"00:17:00,920","00:17:03,400","I'd invite you, but if what I said
sounded bad,"
246,"00:17:03,480","00:17:05,440",you'll think I'm gonna dismember you.
247,"00:17:05,520","00:17:07,000","The surprise guest, right?"
248,"00:17:07,880","00:17:10,480","- Where do you live?
- Know where the Leisters live?"
249,"00:17:10,560","00:17:12,440",Of course. Do you live near there?
250,"00:17:13,200","00:17:14,840","- I live there.
- What?"
251,"00:17:15,520","00:17:17,120",You live in Nicholas' house?
252,"00:17:17,200","00:17:19,360",Worse. He's my stepbrother.
253,"00:17:19,440","00:17:22,040","- And the one who left me stranded.
- Nick?"
254,"00:17:23,120","00:17:24,440",What an asshole.
255,"00:17:25,200","00:17:28,600","Well, now I get it.
He didn't have time to drop you home."
256,"00:17:28,680","00:17:31,600","- What do you mean?
- He wanted to get there early."
257,"00:17:31,680","00:17:34,480","- Get where?
- To the party I just told you about."
258,"00:17:35,320","00:17:37,160","Hold on, Nick is there?"
259,"00:17:37,240","00:17:39,240",There's no party without Nick.
260,"00:18:01,200","00:18:02,720","Noah, listen."
261,"00:18:02,800","00:18:05,160","It's a gang get-together, so be careful."
262,"00:18:05,240","00:18:07,600",That's the most dangerous one over there.
263,"00:18:07,680","00:18:09,760",That guy in white is Ronnie.
264,"00:18:12,080","00:18:15,920","Got out of prison yesterday.
To give you an idea of what the deal is."
265,"00:18:18,560","00:18:19,680",What's up?
266,"00:18:20,720","00:18:22,760","- How are you?
- Yo, Ronnie."
267,"00:18:22,840","00:18:25,360","- Good to see you.
- You good? How are you?"
268,"00:18:28,440","00:18:31,520","Listen. You've got
the purples, the greens,"
269,"00:18:31,600","00:18:33,920","the blues, and then there's our gang."
270,"00:18:37,040","00:18:38,640",And that's our leader.
271,"00:18:38,720","00:18:41,280",Let's go!
272,"00:18:41,880","00:18:43,440","How's it going, man?"
273,"00:18:44,680","00:18:45,680",Drink!
274,"00:18:46,880","00:18:48,200",Yeah!
275,"00:19:26,080","00:19:29,240","- What are you doing here?
- Surprised I made it on foot?"
276,"00:19:29,320","00:19:31,120","- Who'd you come with?
- Shithead."
277,"00:19:31,200","00:19:33,600","Freckles, just go back
to where you came from."
278,"00:19:33,680","00:19:36,000","I'm staying here
until I want to leave."
279,"00:19:36,080","00:19:39,040","- I won't repeat it.
- You're in no position to order me."
280,"00:19:39,120","00:19:42,360","- I'm not?
- What if your dad finds out about this?"
281,"00:19:43,840","00:19:46,000","- You wouldn't dare.
- The perfect boy, huh?"
282,"00:19:46,080","00:19:47,960",Damn. You've really fooled everyone.
283,"00:19:48,040","00:19:51,640","- I'm perfect in many ways, honey.
- Modesty isn't one of them."
284,"00:19:51,720","00:19:53,920","The other girls
are not concerned about that."
285,"00:19:54,000","00:19:56,000",I'm not like most other girls.
286,"00:19:56,080","00:19:58,400",You're not? I'd say you are.
287,"00:20:00,000","00:20:01,520",Ordinary lips...
288,"00:20:02,880","00:20:04,440",An empty gaze...
289,"00:20:05,840","00:20:07,200",A neck...
290,"00:20:08,040","00:20:09,600","- What's that?
- A knot."
291,"00:20:09,680","00:20:11,280",To show how twisted you are?
292,"00:20:11,360","00:20:13,440","- To show how strong I am.
- Strong."
293,"00:20:13,520","00:20:15,760","A figure-of-eight knot,
the hardest to undo."
294,"00:20:15,840","00:20:18,160",There's no knot too hard for me.
295,"00:20:18,960","00:20:21,760","Just by kissing their tattoos,
girls loosen up."
296,"00:20:21,840","00:20:25,040","- How can you be sure everyone likes you?
- Small details."
297,"00:20:25,120","00:20:28,120","- Such as?
- You haven't asked me to let go of you."
298,"00:20:29,320","00:20:31,200",Obviously I want you to let go!
299,"00:20:31,280","00:20:34,160","Never mind. I like women,
not girls with braids."
300,"00:20:34,240","00:20:36,840","- I never wear braids.
- Look, sis,"
301,"00:20:36,920","00:20:39,280",you have no idea what you're getting into.
302,"00:20:39,360","00:20:42,720","So stay out of my way,
and I'll stay out of yours. Got it?"
303,"00:20:44,840","00:20:45,840",Asshole.
304,"00:20:51,680","00:20:53,440",Can I help you?
305,"00:20:54,760","00:20:56,720","- Shit, sorry. Is this your Jeep?
- No."
306,"00:20:56,800","00:20:59,040","Just some creep's
who snuck into the party."
307,"00:20:59,120","00:21:00,360","Wreck it, if you want."
308,"00:21:01,320","00:21:02,520","You're Noah, right?"
309,"00:21:03,840","00:21:06,800","If Nick sent you to watch over me,
I don't need it."
310,"00:21:06,880","00:21:09,680","I'm not here for him.
Mario told me what he did."
311,"00:21:10,480","00:21:12,840","- Are you his girlfriend?
- Mario's? No."
312,"00:21:12,920","00:21:16,320","No, Nick's. He's got his tongue
down every girl's throat."
313,"00:21:16,400","00:21:18,240",Nick and I go way back.
314,"00:21:18,320","00:21:21,800","- I feel sorry for you, he's a jerk.
- He has his days."
315,"00:21:30,280","00:21:31,920","Hey, what's up? Cheers!"
316,"00:21:32,680","00:21:34,000","What's up, dog?"
317,"00:21:35,240","00:21:37,040",How are you? Sorry for the trouble.
318,"00:21:37,120","00:21:39,960","If I'd taken the sports car,
I wouldn't have had an excuse."
319,"00:21:40,040","00:21:42,000","No worries, I'll take the 4x4."
320,"00:21:42,680","00:21:43,960","- Fuck.
- What is it?"
321,"00:21:44,040","00:21:47,640","I can't see my boyfriend's
and my best friend's stories."
322,"00:21:47,720","00:21:50,680","So you need a new boyfriend
and a new best friend."
323,"00:21:50,760","00:21:53,000","- I'm Jenna.
- Nice to meet you."
324,"00:21:53,080","00:21:55,840","- I must've just pressed something.
- Look at me."
325,"00:21:55,920","00:21:59,200","Forget about that, girl.
Take off your bra, get drunk,"
326,"00:21:59,280","00:22:01,960","and make out with the hottest guy.
In that order."
327,"00:22:02,040","00:22:05,720","I'm not really into all that,
regardless of the order."
328,"00:22:05,800","00:22:07,800",Who's that hottie talking to Jenna?
329,"00:22:08,360","00:22:10,840","Hottie? You're tripping, dude."
330,"00:22:10,920","00:22:12,320","Go on, get out of here."
331,"00:22:13,040","00:22:16,160","Put this on so Ronnie's gang members
don't bother you."
332,"00:22:16,240","00:22:18,440","Anything I can put on
to keep Nick away?"
333,"00:22:18,520","00:22:20,960","Hey! Hello, ladies."
334,"00:22:21,040","00:22:22,400","- Hi, man.
- Hi."
335,"00:22:23,400","00:22:25,200","Hey! Hey, shoo!"
336,"00:22:25,280","00:22:27,160","No, this is Lion, my boyfriend."
337,"00:22:28,640","00:22:32,000","- He's one of ours.
- Welcome to the club, then."
338,"00:22:35,000","00:22:36,000",Okay.
339,"00:23:08,760","00:23:09,960",Hi.
340,"00:23:10,720","00:23:12,640",So you're Nick's sister.
341,"00:23:13,360","00:23:15,960","Damn, news sure travels fast, Ronnie."
342,"00:23:16,040","00:23:17,160",Yeah.
343,"00:23:25,200","00:23:26,200",What's up?
344,"00:23:27,680","00:23:28,760",Coke or mojito?
345,"00:23:31,720","00:23:33,080","- Coke.
- Here."
346,"00:23:35,480","00:23:37,440","- Shit, this has rum in it.
- Just a little."
347,"00:23:37,520","00:23:39,800","- No, thanks.
- Drink, it's good."
348,"00:23:39,920","00:23:42,400","- No, thank you.
- Drink, don't be silly."
349,"00:23:43,440","00:23:45,840","- What the hell?
- Last time you crash my party."
350,"00:23:45,920","00:23:48,520",Get your Jeep and scram before I kill you.
351,"00:23:53,440","00:23:55,920","Why do guys
solve everything with violence?"
352,"00:23:56,000","00:23:58,200",Right. I'm still hurting from your punch.
353,"00:23:58,280","00:24:01,080",We agreed to stay out of each other's way.
354,"00:24:02,880","00:24:03,920",What are you doing?
355,"00:24:04,000","00:24:06,640","That asshole
goes around spiking girls' drinks."
356,"00:24:06,720","00:24:09,240",What? Shit.
357,"00:24:09,880","00:24:12,880","- I'm taking you home.
- No, I'm going with Mario."
358,"00:24:12,960","00:24:15,480",Mario! Mario?
359,"00:24:22,440","00:24:25,520","I'm fine, I just feel a little hot, okay?"
360,"00:24:27,760","00:24:30,800","Hey, leave me alone.
I'm just cold, damn it."
361,"00:24:31,440","00:24:34,720","No, man, not again. No, let me drive."
362,"00:24:34,800","00:24:38,040","- I've always wanted to drive one of these.
- My baby? Never."
363,"00:24:38,120","00:24:41,480","- You're drugged and don't have a license.
- I'm just dizzy."
364,"00:24:41,560","00:24:43,120","You did drink, though."
365,"00:24:44,040","00:24:45,280",Just one shot.
366,"00:24:45,360","00:24:47,560","Yeah, but off of someone's boobs."
367,"00:24:48,080","00:24:53,520","Nice and salty tequila mixed with sweat.
Tasty, huh?"
368,"00:25:00,000","00:25:04,240","What would Freud say about pouring liquids
and sucking them all up like that?"
369,"00:25:05,200","00:25:08,760","Freud isn't some trap singer,
just so you know."
370,"00:25:08,840","00:25:11,920","He'd say that it's like shedding tears,
or something worse,"
371,"00:25:12,000","00:25:14,280","on your mother's breasts.
So suck on that!"
372,"00:25:14,360","00:25:15,960",Leave my mom alone.
373,"00:25:17,120","00:25:19,560","Sweetie, where's the Bohemian glass?"
374,"00:25:19,640","00:25:20,640",What's the matter?
375,"00:25:21,800","00:25:26,480","Your mom never taught you that there's
a thing called a glass to pour liquids in?"
376,"00:25:26,560","00:25:29,680","Hey, Darcy, my friend!
This is your great-grandson."
377,"00:25:29,760","00:25:32,560","But don't be fooled,
he's no English dandy like you,"
378,"00:25:32,640","00:25:34,480",even with a damsel in his arms.
379,"00:25:35,240","00:25:36,240","Oh, my!"
380,"00:25:36,800","00:25:38,640",What's this?
381,"00:25:38,720","00:25:42,320","I bet you drink your steroids
out of a glass though, right?"
382,"00:25:42,400","00:25:44,960","Well, you know what? Glass is a liquid."
383,"00:25:45,040","00:25:48,520","A liquid that holds another liquid.
Neat, right?"
384,"00:25:49,760","00:25:53,000","If you were capable of having emotions,
you'd appreciate it."
385,"00:25:54,240","00:25:58,040","Glass flows so slowly
that it appears solid."
386,"00:25:58,880","00:26:00,280",That's why it's so fragile.
387,"00:26:01,040","00:26:04,160","Hard, but fragile."
388,"00:26:06,960","00:26:08,600","No, not the light!"
389,"00:26:17,640","00:26:18,640",Don't touch me.
390,"00:26:20,720","00:26:22,000",Asshole.
391,"00:26:38,360","00:26:39,600",Noah.
392,"00:26:39,680","00:26:41,160","Sweetheart, wake up."
393,"00:26:42,080","00:26:43,440","- Sweetheart.
- Rafaella!"
394,"00:26:43,520","00:26:45,120","Come, honey."
395,"00:26:46,600","00:26:47,600",Come on.
396,"00:26:48,880","00:26:50,040",Get in here.
397,"00:26:50,600","00:26:51,960","- Here.
- What's going on?"
398,"00:26:52,040","00:26:53,520",Open the fucking door!
399,"00:26:54,520","00:26:55,920","Don't come out, okay?"
400,"00:26:58,400","00:27:00,600",Open it or I'll break it!
401,"00:27:17,480","00:27:20,520","- Working at Mikel's house, were you?
- Yes."
402,"00:27:20,600","00:27:23,680","- Ibuprofen?
- Thanks, Martín."
403,"00:27:24,240","00:27:28,120","- Coffee, miss?
- Thanks, Mortimer, I'll get it myself."
404,"00:27:28,960","00:27:32,080","- What happened last night?
- You really don't remember?"
405,"00:27:33,360","00:27:36,520","- This'll be fun.
- When your dad walks through that door."
406,"00:27:36,600","00:27:39,160","- We'll see who ends up worse off.
- Tell me."
407,"00:27:40,320","00:27:42,840","I put you into bed
and lots of things happened."
408,"00:27:42,920","00:27:44,000",You didn't touch me.
409,"00:27:44,080","00:27:47,840","That's what a psychopath would do.
You're more twisted, Nick Leister."
410,"00:27:47,920","00:27:49,880","- Really?
- I know you did something."
411,"00:27:49,960","00:27:51,600","- Did you record me?
- No."
412,"00:27:51,680","00:27:53,720","I should have, you were very funny."
413,"00:27:56,520","00:27:57,880",Good morning.
414,"00:27:57,960","00:27:59,240","- Good morning.
- Hi."
415,"00:27:59,320","00:28:00,800","- Hi.
- How was last night?"
416,"00:28:00,880","00:28:01,960",Last night?
417,"00:28:03,000","00:28:06,000","- You know where I was last night?
- Yes, at Jenna's."
418,"00:28:06,800","00:28:10,480","You texted me to say you were staying
there to watch La La Land."
419,"00:28:10,560","00:28:13,000","- I did?
- Jenna is from a very wealthy family."
420,"00:28:14,480","00:28:17,880","Well, that's besides the point.
Her boyfriend is a mechanic."
421,"00:28:17,960","00:28:19,680",You're going to get on just great.
422,"00:28:19,760","00:28:20,600","Yeah, I'm sure."
423,"00:28:20,680","00:28:23,000","Thanks for introducing her
to your friends."
424,"00:28:23,080","00:28:25,280","You're welcome,
anything I can do to help."
425,"00:28:25,360","00:28:26,640",You're so sweet.
426,"00:28:27,280","00:28:29,920","And I'm glad
you've settled your differences."
427,"00:28:32,680","00:28:35,720","MOM, I WAS WRONG ABOUT NICK.
HE'S WONDERFUL"
428,"00:28:37,040","00:28:39,520",Were there any boys your age?
429,"00:28:39,600","00:28:40,760",I don't need friends.
430,"00:28:40,840","00:28:43,480","You separated me from Dan,
but I won't forget him."
431,"00:28:43,560","00:28:46,880","- Sweetie...
- He's much better than all these snobs."
432,"00:28:50,520","00:28:51,680",Dan?
433,"00:28:52,920","00:28:56,360","Her boyfriend. She misses him,
she must've had a bad night."
434,"00:28:57,520","00:28:59,320",More pancakes?
435,"00:29:00,080","00:29:01,560","I'm good. Thanks, Petra."
436,"00:29:04,480","00:29:07,160","- Right here's fine.

441,"00:29:25,600","00:29:26,640",I almost hit you.
442,"00:29:30,280","00:29:31,520","Hey, sis."
443,"00:29:32,800","00:29:35,000",Don't ever touch my phone again.
444,"00:29:35,080","00:29:37,080",Don't ruin one of my parties again.

446,"00:29:40,520","00:29:42,040",I hate chick flicks.
447,"00:29:42,120","00:29:44,520","You're more into porn, right?
With that face..."
448,"00:29:45,080","00:29:46,080",Leave her alone.
449,"00:29:46,680","00:29:50,000","- Just ignore them.
- It's fine. I can stick up for myself."
450,"00:29:50,720","00:29:53,320","Bro, you missed out
on the best part of the party."
451,"00:29:53,400","00:29:55,560","I know, man. I crashed."
452,"00:29:55,640","00:29:56,840",I stayed up reading.

466,"00:30:37,720","00:30:39,360","- Nick.
- What?"
467,"00:30:39,440","00:30:42,320","- You didn't invite us to your party.
- I saw you there."
468,"00:30:42,400","00:30:45,000","Please, can we come to the race tonight?"
469,"00:30:46,920","00:30:49,000",I don't know what you're talking about.

476,"00:32:01,960","00:32:03,240",What's the matter?
477,"00:32:05,720","00:32:08,440","Are you afraid
you won't make it to the final?"
478,"00:32:08,520","00:32:11,200","Don't worry, I'll beat you
like I do every year."

553,"00:41:05,280","00:41:06,920",Already? So soon?
554,"00:41:08,280","00:41:12,080","No, hey, I...
You don't get it, I'm not racing, Nick is."
555,"00:41:12,160","00:41:13,880",So why the fuck isn't he here?
556,"00:41:14,520","00:41:15,680",Shit.
557,"00:41:25,240","00:41:27,240","Whoa, baby! Where are you going?"
558,"00:41:27,320","00:41:29,120","If no one races, we win."
559,"00:41:33,560","00:41:35,080",I can tell you want to.
560,"00:41:35,160","00:41:38,680","Since you're a woman,
I'll give you a five-second head start."
561,"00:41:39,560","00:41:42,120","- What do you say?
- Five seconds?"
562,"00:41:47,360","00:41:48,360","What's up, Nick?"
563,"00:41:49,240","00:41:50,960","- What are you doing here?
- Ready?"
564,"00:41:51,040","00:41:53,000","- Didn't you get my text?
- What text?"
565,"00:41:53,080","00:41:54,080",Ready?
566,"00:41:54,120","00:41:56,680","But if you're here, then..."
567,"00:41:58,240","00:41:59,440",You're shitting me.
568,"00:42:07,440","00:42:09,360",What? Why aren't they going?
569,"00:42:13,120","00:42:17,120","Hey! What are you doing?
I just gave you a head start."
570,"00:42:17,200","00:42:18,800","I know, I'm using it."
571,"00:42:19,560","00:42:23,960","When we reach the finish line,
I want people to know a woman beat you."
572,"00:42:41,440","00:42:42,440",What the fuck?
573,"00:42:55,800","00:42:56,920",Hey!
574,"00:42:57,760","00:42:58,880",What are you doing?
575,"00:43:02,520","00:43:03,920","What the hell, asshole?"
576,"00:43:15,680","00:43:17,240",I like this girl.
577,"00:43:22,720","00:43:25,120",Come on!
578,"00:43:39,080","00:43:40,560",The sixth turn.
579,"00:43:54,800","00:43:57,360","She's not braking.
She'll run off the track."
580,"00:44:15,520","00:44:17,480",Yes! Take that!
581,"00:44:25,280","00:44:26,120",Fuck!
582,"00:44:26,200","00:44:27,240",What's he doing?
583,"00:44:29,520","00:44:31,240",What's he doing? He's crazy!
584,"00:44:55,280","00:44:57,560",Yeah!
585,"00:44:57,640","00:44:59,880",Yes! Yes!
586,"00:45:11,320","00:45:13,520","- Have you lost your mind?
- But I won."
587,"00:45:13,600","00:45:16,440","- You don't know what you've done.
- Damn cheaters!"
588,"00:45:18,600","00:45:20,080","What happened, Leister?"
589,"00:45:20,160","00:45:22,360",The finale was between you and me.
590,"00:45:22,440","00:45:24,600",You've totally disregarded the rules.
591,"00:45:24,680","00:45:27,120","- So we win.
- That's ridiculous."
592,"00:45:27,200","00:45:29,360",She's not in the gang. We'll race again.
593,"00:45:29,440","00:45:31,200",She is. She's wearing the bandana.
594,"00:45:31,280","00:45:34,000","You're the one who cheated
by ramming into me."
595,"00:45:34,080","00:45:36,400","And I still beat you, asshole. A woman."
596,"00:45:36,480","00:45:37,640",Look at me. A woman.
597,"00:45:37,720","00:45:39,880","- Shut up, will you?
- Sorry, Nick."
598,"00:45:39,960","00:45:42,800",Rules are rules. So pay up.
599,"00:45:45,680","00:45:47,400","I'm transferring the 15,000."
600,"00:45:47,480","00:45:51,120","- Nick, that's crazy.
- You just couldn't help yourself. Move."
601,"00:45:51,200","00:45:54,360","I'll pay you back,
even if it takes me years to save up."
602,"00:45:55,000","00:45:56,400",And the other thing?
603,"00:45:56,480","00:45:59,760","I know it's hard
to part ways with that beauty,"
604,"00:45:59,840","00:46:01,600",but you don't have a choice.
605,"00:46:06,720","00:46:09,160","Nick? You can't give it to him.
Are you crazy?"
606,"00:46:09,240","00:46:12,160","Don't worry,
I'll take you for a ride anytime."
607,"00:46:12,240","00:46:15,160","You're not going to enjoy it.
You know why?"
608,"00:46:15,240","00:46:17,400","- No.
- Because I beat you good."
609,"00:46:17,480","00:46:20,440","Everyone'll remember that
when you're showing off in it."
610,"00:46:21,520","00:46:22,520",Nick.
611,"00:46:23,240","00:46:24,800",Please.
612,"00:46:24,880","00:46:27,880","Next time,
don't let that bitch out of the house."
613,"00:46:32,360","00:46:33,560",What are they doing?
614,"00:46:56,000","00:46:57,160",Rafaella!
615,"00:47:06,440","00:47:08,080",Push forward! Come on!
616,"00:47:08,160","00:47:09,680","What's wrong, girl? Let's go."
617,"00:47:15,560","00:47:17,800",Get in the car. Come on.
618,"00:47:20,920","00:47:21,920","Let's go, brother!"
619,"00:47:27,400","00:47:28,400",Move!
620,"00:47:29,960","00:47:31,440",Drive!
621,"00:47:40,680","00:47:41,680",You.
622,"00:47:45,120","00:47:47,360","- Are they following us?
- I don't think so."
623,"00:47:47,440","00:47:48,720","Jenna, are you okay?"
624,"00:47:49,240","00:47:52,360","- Answer me.
- Stop pestering me. I'm in shock."
625,"00:47:52,440","00:47:53,880",I worry if you don't talk.
626,"00:47:53,960","00:47:55,920","- Because you love me?
- Don't start."
627,"00:47:56,000","00:47:58,840","- Not even a little?
- Girl, quit nagging me."
628,"00:47:58,920","00:48:01,120","- God, you're lame.
- ""You're lame."""
629,"00:48:10,040","00:48:14,200","- Come on! Get up, you've slept enough.
- I don't feel well today either."
630,"00:48:14,280","00:48:17,200","Today is Will's company gala
and I need your help."
631,"00:48:18,160","00:48:20,720","UNKNOWN: SHOULD'VE KEPT
YOUR MOUTH SHUT, BITCH."
632,"00:48:20,800","00:48:22,040",Is that Dan?
633,"00:48:22,840","00:48:26,440","I didn't know that you were so close
to him and Betty. I'm sorry."
634,"00:48:26,520","00:48:28,840","- That doesn't matter now.
- It does."
635,"00:48:28,920","00:48:30,680",I don't want to see you like this.
636,"00:48:30,760","00:48:33,880","You'll end up mummified
with all that Egyptian cotton."
637,"00:48:33,960","00:48:37,720","Here's the plan: breakfast
at the beach club and then the hair salon."
638,"00:48:37,800","00:48:40,200","Which one?
Will and Nick will wear a tuxedo."
639,"00:48:40,280","00:48:41,120",Nick's here?
640,"00:48:41,200","00:48:42,680","He's been missing for 4 days,"
641,"00:48:42,760","00:48:46,160","but he knows this gala's important
to his dad. He'll show."
642,"00:48:50,120","00:48:51,440",That hater again?
643,"00:48:51,520","00:48:54,120","It's got to be Ronnie, right?
Just block him."
644,"00:48:54,680","00:48:58,160","Yeah... I just got here
and everyone hates me already."
645,"00:48:58,240","00:48:59,960",Which one are you wearing?
646,"00:49:16,920","00:49:18,480","Hey, Will! Which one?"
647,"00:49:19,120","00:49:20,840",Both are beautiful.
648,"00:49:20,920","00:49:23,720","I'll tell the designers,
but which one should I wear?"
649,"00:49:23,800","00:49:25,400",We'll be late for rehearsal.
650,"00:49:26,440","00:49:27,960",I don't know. The black one.
651,"00:49:28,040","00:49:31,240","Important people will be there.
Judges, lawyers..."
652,"00:49:31,320","00:49:34,560","- We can't leave this to chance.
- Relax, you'll look gorgeous."
653,"00:49:34,640","00:49:36,040",That's not the point.
654,"00:49:37,760","00:49:38,960",What's the matter?
655,"00:49:40,800","00:49:43,720","What are you worried about?
Not being good enough?"
656,"00:49:44,560","00:49:45,640",Is that it?
657,"00:49:46,840","00:49:48,280",Look at me.
658,"00:49:49,720","00:49:52,640","You've been through
more important tests in your life."
659,"00:49:52,720","00:49:54,320",This will be child's play.
660,"00:49:56,240","00:49:58,160",I don't know what you saw in me.
661,"00:49:59,320","00:50:02,000","I remember you
walking through that cathedral,"
662,"00:50:02,080","00:50:05,320","and describing its altarpieces
and its dome with such passion"
663,"00:50:05,400","00:50:07,880","that it seemed
like you'd built it yourself."
664,"00:50:07,960","00:50:11,600","I'll have to show it to you again
because you never looked up."
665,"00:50:12,160","00:50:13,760",Tonight's going to be the same.
666,"00:50:13,840","00:50:15,960",I'm only going to have eyes for you.
667,"00:50:16,680","00:50:18,560",Hey. Listen to me.
668,"00:50:19,880","00:50:24,760","This family and all of its companies,
think of them as a huge cathedral."
669,"00:50:25,400","00:50:28,160","And you'll be
the perfect tour guide. Okay?"
670,"00:50:29,760","00:50:31,800","- I love you.
- I love you too."
671,"00:50:35,960","00:50:37,600",Hurry up.
672,"00:50:43,680","00:50:45,840",I think I'll wear the pink one.
673,"00:50:51,480","00:50:54,440","Hey, you know Rodrigo
wants to be my boyfriend?"
674,"00:50:54,560","00:50:56,360",The blond? What will you tell him?
675,"00:50:56,480","00:50:58,760","- No.
- Good girl!"
676,"00:50:58,840","00:51:00,520",You'll only get heartbroken.
677,"00:51:00,600","00:51:03,800","Do what I do, sis,
run away before it's too late."
678,"00:51:03,880","00:51:07,160","I have two boyfriends already.
Why would I want three?"
679,"00:51:09,680","00:51:10,800",My blood sugar.
680,"00:51:13,120","00:51:15,440","Come here, sweetie. There we go."
681,"00:51:16,880","00:51:20,520","Mommy's going traveling again,
will you come see me?"
682,"00:51:21,240","00:51:22,120",I don't know.
683,"00:51:22,200","00:51:24,840","- When will she be back?
- She didn't say."
684,"00:51:26,960","00:51:28,760",What if she doesn't come back?
685,"00:51:28,840","00:51:30,520",What do you mean?
686,"00:51:30,600","00:51:33,240","What if she divorces my daddy
and abandons me?"
687,"00:51:33,320","00:51:36,280","- That will never happen, honey.
- She did it to you."
688,"00:51:37,640","00:51:39,320","That was different, sweetie."
689,"00:51:40,080","00:51:43,600","I was a disastrous son,
an intolerable little devil."
690,"00:51:43,680","00:51:47,800","Unlike you. You're a little angel.
You're growing wings and everything."
691,"00:51:51,400","00:51:52,520","Hey, Maggie..."
692,"00:51:53,360","00:51:55,040",I have to leave early today.
693,"00:51:55,120","00:51:57,720","No, why? Please don't go!"
694,"00:52:16,960","00:52:18,000",Ma'am.
695,"00:52:19,760","00:52:20,760",Sir.
696,"00:52:21,600","00:52:24,080",Honey. Everything went great.
697,"00:52:24,160","00:52:25,160","Hello, Noah."
698,"00:52:48,320","00:52:49,680",\an8STATUSES - NICK
699,"00:53:21,600","00:53:22,600",Thor.
700,"00:53:36,240","00:53:37,840",Those turns are impossible.
701,"00:53:39,320","00:53:40,360",They can be done.
702,"00:53:41,920","00:53:44,240","You just have to pull on the handbrake,"
703,"00:53:44,320","00:53:48,640","and turn the steering wheel 20 degrees
to the right and 60 to the left."
704,"00:53:50,160","00:53:52,280","Twenty, sixty. Like a passcode."
705,"00:53:53,160","00:53:54,360",That's right.
706,"00:53:56,120","00:53:58,160",You stood Anna up at the gala.
707,"00:53:59,440","00:54:00,560",Where were you?
708,"00:54:01,200","00:54:03,040",With someone who needed me.
709,"00:54:04,000","00:54:05,960",I thought I was your only sister.
710,"00:54:08,400","00:54:10,680","- I'm sorry about...
- It doesn't matter."
711,"00:54:10,760","00:54:11,960","No, it does matter."
712,"00:54:12,040","00:54:15,200","- That car must be worth over...
- That doesn't matter."
713,"00:54:51,640","00:54:53,000",This isn't right.
714,"00:54:55,000","00:54:56,960","- No, it isn't right at all.
- No."
715,"00:55:00,560","00:55:02,960",You're my stepsister and you're 17.
716,"00:55:03,040","00:55:05,080",Then kiss me until I turn 18.
717,"00:55:14,880","00:55:16,560",Don't let me do this again.
718,"00:55:17,520","00:55:21,920","Wait, you get close to me
and I have to prevent it?"
719,"00:55:22,000","00:55:24,280",I don't know what's happening to me.
720,"00:55:25,680","00:55:27,080","Nick, is that you?"
721,"00:55:30,520","00:55:32,600",You think what you did today was okay?
722,"00:55:32,680","00:55:36,160","It wasn't just a gala,
we were introducing ourselves as a family."
723,"00:55:36,240","00:55:38,000",We can't give that impression.
724,"00:55:38,080","00:55:40,480","Your dad is upstairs.
You should talk to him."
725,"00:55:40,560","00:55:41,960",I'll go right now.
726,"00:55:49,240","00:55:52,160",And you? You didn't say a word all night.
727,"00:55:53,560","00:55:55,440",What am I going to do with you?
728,"00:56:12,520","00:56:15,720","- From racing driver to car washer.
- And tomorrow, waitress."
729,"00:56:16,520","00:56:19,960","- Want one?
- You shouldn't kill your last brain cell."
730,"00:56:21,880","00:56:23,320",Hey! Don't.
731,"00:56:23,400","00:56:26,200","We agreed you couldn't come
near me. Remember?"
732,"00:56:27,480","00:56:29,000",But you can watch.
733,"00:56:32,800","00:56:34,200",Tequila?
734,"00:56:46,880","00:56:48,080","- Hi, sweetie.
- Hi."
735,"00:56:48,960","00:56:50,640",Why are you washing that beater?
736,"00:56:53,840","00:56:55,400",I have a surprise for you.
737,"00:56:56,480","00:56:59,240","- What, the car?
- No. The car's mine."
738,"00:57:02,440","00:57:03,480","Hi, Noah."
739,"00:57:05,800","00:57:06,800",Dan.
740,"00:57:10,880","00:57:12,320",What are you doing here?
741,"00:57:13,120","00:57:14,920","You can kiss, don't mind me."
742,"00:57:17,000","00:57:18,320",It's good to see you.
743,"00:57:23,080","00:57:26,320","I need to finish washing
the car, I was..."
744,"00:57:26,400","00:57:27,440",Okay.
745,"00:57:28,440","00:57:32,040","- Come, I'll show you to your bedroom.
- Okay. See you in a bit."
746,"00:57:43,640","00:57:46,000","No! No, please, no."
747,"00:57:46,080","00:57:47,240",No!
748,"00:57:49,120","00:57:50,920",Nick! We've got a problem.
749,"00:57:51,920","00:57:54,840","- You're the one getting close now.
- No, it's just..."
750,"00:57:54,920","00:57:59,200","- My boyfriend... I mean, my ex is here.
- You're the one with the problem then."
751,"00:57:59,280","00:58:04,800","- I sent him the picture of us kissing.
- Oh, right! That picture. Yes."
752,"00:58:04,880","00:58:05,720",So what?
753,"00:58:05,800","00:58:08,600","- If he recognizes you, he'll tell my mom.
- Noah?"
754,"00:58:09,960","00:58:10,960",Noah.
755,"00:58:12,080","00:58:13,080",Excuse me.
756,"00:58:16,640","00:58:17,480",Noah.
757,"00:58:17,560","00:58:19,960","Can't believe you had
the cheek to come here."
758,"00:58:20,040","00:58:21,480",I came to say I'm sorry.
759,"00:58:21,560","00:58:23,520","- Sorry?
- Sorry."
760,"00:58:24,520","00:58:28,560","Betty didn't mean anything.
I missed you and she reminded me of you."
761,"00:58:28,640","00:58:31,520","You remind me of an orangutan,
but I didn't kiss one."
762,"00:58:33,760","00:58:36,760","Noah, I know.
I know I've been a real jerk."
763,"00:58:36,840","00:58:38,920",I deserve everything I have coming.
764,"00:58:40,840","00:58:41,680","Sorry, dude."
765,"00:58:41,760","00:58:44,360","- Pack your bags and leave, today.
- Fine."
766,"00:58:44,440","00:58:47,800","- But there are no flights until tomorrow.
- God damn you, Dan!"
767,"00:58:47,880","00:58:49,520","Well, brother!"
768,"00:58:49,600","00:58:52,560","You're soaked!
No worries, dude, come with me."
769,"00:58:52,640","00:58:54,800","- Are you stupid?
- That was fun, wasn't it?"
770,"00:58:54,880","00:58:55,880",No.
771,"00:58:57,880","00:58:59,600",I'll help you dry off.
772,"00:58:59,680","00:59:01,320",Okay? Look.
773,"00:59:06,280","00:59:07,280",Asshole!
774,"00:59:12,360","00:59:13,640",What are you doing?
775,"00:59:17,800","00:59:19,480",Dan could see us.
776,"00:59:29,800","00:59:32,960","If our parents catch us,
it'll be game over."
777,"00:59:33,040","00:59:34,560",Is that what you want?
778,"00:59:34,640","00:59:37,040",No. You?
779,"00:59:38,160","00:59:39,160",No.
780,"00:59:46,720","00:59:48,200",Right... Let's see.
781,"00:59:49,160","00:59:50,000","Oh, God."
782,"00:59:50,080","00:59:53,080","It's fine, we'll dry you off,
we'll help you..."
783,"00:59:53,160","00:59:58,200","- Sorry, who is that guy with Noah?
- That's her neighbor, Cayetano."
784,"00:59:58,280","00:59:59,560",Nicholas!
785,"01:00:00,880","01:00:01,800",Coming!
786,"01:00:01,880","01:00:03,360","That's right, Nicholas."
787,"01:00:13,000","01:00:15,560","Hey, wasn't that the guy from the picture?"
788,"01:00:26,880","01:00:28,760","- Surprise!
- Damn, Mom."
789,"01:00:28,840","01:00:30,320",Look what came for you.
790,"01:00:30,400","01:00:33,200","I'd say these flowers
smell like a reunion."
791,"01:00:34,080","01:00:35,080",Thanks.
792,"01:00:36,360","01:00:40,320","- Honey, did something happen with Dan?
- No."
793,"01:00:40,400","01:00:42,840",I just didn't expect to see him so soon.
794,"01:00:42,920","01:00:46,080","It was some sort of emotional jet lag.
I'll be fine."
795,"01:00:47,680","01:00:49,720","Have you met someone else, maybe?"
796,"01:00:50,400","01:00:53,400","No, not at all.
Who would I have met?"
797,"01:00:53,480","01:00:54,680",Right.
798,"01:00:54,760","01:00:57,120","Well, he'll be on the same floor."
799,"01:00:57,200","01:00:58,200",Who?
800,"01:00:58,720","01:01:02,040","Dan. I trust you'll behave
responsibly and show restraint."
801,"01:01:02,960","01:01:06,440","- All right, Mom. Get out of here.
- Okay, okay..."
802,"01:01:09,240","01:01:11,760",YOU'RE GOING TO PAY FOR WHAT YOU DID
803,"01:01:12,640","01:01:13,720",What the hell?
804,"01:01:16,800","01:01:18,280",Why are you doing this?
805,"01:01:19,040","01:01:20,720","- That's not mine.
- Please."
806,"01:01:20,800","01:01:22,920","I'm persistent, but not violent."
807,"01:01:23,000","01:01:25,600","Is it from Betty?
Does she know you're here?"
808,"01:01:25,680","01:01:26,840",Forget about Betty.
809,"01:01:30,000","01:01:32,560",Does your mom not suspect any of this?
810,"01:01:32,640","01:01:34,880","- I don't know what you mean.
- Sure."
811,"01:01:36,120","01:01:38,240",Can we talk tonight over a drink?
812,"01:01:39,040","01:01:41,720",Mallows? Who would send mallows as a gift?
813,"01:01:53,440","01:01:55,440",I found you a cheap hotel nearby.
814,"01:01:57,000","01:01:59,320","You gave that Leister
a good beating, right?"
815,"01:01:59,400","01:02:02,960","Don't worry, the car won't be
the only thing I take from him."
816,"01:02:07,200","01:02:09,800",So what are you waiting for? Go get her.
817,"01:02:09,880","01:02:12,560",I thought you'd want to be here to see it.
818,"01:02:15,240","01:02:18,640",Call your buddies and let the party begin.
819,"01:02:32,440","01:02:36,520","- Bye, Nick. It's your loss.
- Some other time, girls."
820,"01:02:53,720","01:02:54,720","Hey, Nick!"
821,"01:02:54,800","01:02:58,000","What are you doing here?
Did your car break down?"
822,"01:02:59,720","01:03:03,160","If you need a ride someplace, really, I..."
823,"01:03:04,280","01:03:07,000","I want you to deliver
a message to your sister."
824,"01:03:37,840","01:03:38,840",Noah?
825,"01:04:52,960","01:04:54,080",Nick!
826,"01:04:54,160","01:04:56,320","- Are you okay?
- Just what I needed."
827,"01:04:56,400","01:04:58,680",I'm sorry. I thought you were Dan.
828,"01:04:59,600","01:05:02,640","I still would've hit you
if I'd thought it was you."
829,"01:05:02,720","01:05:06,320","- Did I do that to you?
- No, but you could've if you wanted to."
830,"01:05:13,320","01:05:16,360","No. Your nose is bleeding,
don't tilt your head backward."
831,"01:05:16,440","01:05:19,080","You need a cold compress.
Do you have painkillers?"
832,"01:05:19,160","01:05:21,400",You know about beatings as well as cars?
833,"01:05:21,480","01:05:23,400","I'm perfect in many ways, honey."
834,"01:05:24,840","01:05:26,680","- Who did this?
- Never mind that."
835,"01:05:27,560","01:05:30,400","I swear that from now on,
I'm not fighting anymore."
836,"01:05:32,040","01:05:34,720","- It was Ronnie, wasn't it?
- That guy is crazy."
837,"01:05:34,800","01:05:37,360","He's after you.
You have to stop going out alone."
838,"01:05:37,440","01:05:39,440","- So do you.
- I'm serious."
839,"01:05:39,520","01:05:42,280","- So am I.
- Well, let's stop going out alone."
840,"01:05:42,360","01:05:43,360",Both of us.
841,"01:05:43,440","01:05:47,560","Not the most romantic way to say
you want to spend more time with me."
842,"01:05:49,440","01:05:51,760",Do you want to spend more time with me?
843,"01:05:54,000","01:05:55,840",I can't. Dan's still here.
844,"01:05:56,480","01:05:58,400",Do you still have feelings for him?
845,"01:05:59,880","01:06:00,880",Does it hurt?
846,"01:06:03,880","01:06:04,920",Quite a lot.
847,"01:06:09,560","01:06:10,880",What about here?
848,"01:06:15,640","01:06:16,720",Or here?
849,"01:06:17,920","01:06:19,040",What are you doing?
850,"01:06:19,640","01:06:24,400","I need to check your sensitivity.
You could have a damaged nerve."
851,"01:06:24,480","01:06:27,760","The heat of your hands
won't help with the swelling."
852,"01:06:28,920","01:06:30,840",I can feel you're more swollen.
853,"01:06:55,880","01:06:59,400","- We're being bad again, Freckles.
- Do you want me to stop?"
854,"01:07:00,840","01:07:02,560",Are you sure you can resist?
855,"01:07:05,760","01:07:08,880","Why do we girls
always get hooked on the bad boys?"
856,"01:07:10,480","01:07:12,080","You're cocky,"
857,"01:07:13,480","01:07:14,640","liars,"
858,"01:07:17,000","01:07:18,440",and you're violent.
859,"01:07:20,160","01:07:23,760",You're wrong. I'm not like that.
860,"01:07:29,720","01:07:31,120",Noah?
861,"01:07:35,520","01:07:37,600",Are you okay? I heard a bang and...
862,"01:07:38,280","01:07:41,560","I heard a bang too,
but I got them all in the face."
863,"01:07:43,000","01:07:44,480","I'm fine, thanks."
864,"01:07:48,200","01:07:50,120",You wanted me to forgive you.
865,"01:07:51,560","01:07:54,280","Well, if you could
keep this to yourself, please..."
866,"01:07:55,040","01:07:56,120",Do it for me.
867,"01:08:10,600","01:08:12,160","- Come on, Petra.
- Hush!"
868,"01:08:12,240","01:08:14,200","- A little higher.
- Good morning."
869,"01:08:19,080","01:08:21,440",I cleaned the leaves out of the pool.
870,"01:08:21,520","01:08:24,480","- I'm sorry you slipped.
- It's not your fault, Morti."
871,"01:08:24,560","01:08:25,680",Martín.
872,"01:08:26,240","01:08:28,160",All done. Dan is on the plane.
873,"01:08:28,240","01:08:30,600","- You got a letter from school.
- Thanks."
874,"01:08:36,240","01:08:38,200",Looks like he didn't say anything.
875,"01:08:40,280","01:08:41,280",Yeah.
876,"01:08:53,200","01:08:55,280",I'M GOING TO REALLY MAKE YOU SUFFER
877,"01:08:57,320","01:09:00,160","No spots left on the volleyball team?
That's too bad."
878,"01:09:02,280","01:09:03,440",What's wrong?
879,"01:09:05,680","01:09:06,680",Nothing.
880,"01:09:23,760","01:09:25,680","- I'll move.
- No, we're in a rush."
881,"01:09:32,760","01:09:34,080","Hi, Anna."
882,"01:09:35,840","01:09:37,160",All here?
883,"01:09:46,800","01:09:49,320","Noah, the race the other day was awesome."
884,"01:09:49,400","01:09:52,600","- Where'd you learn to drive?
- I'd rather forget that night."
885,"01:09:52,680","01:09:55,680","Her dad was a rally driver.
She has a photo on Insta."
886,"01:09:55,760","01:09:57,760",Was he good? Is he still competing?
887,"01:09:57,840","01:09:59,320",He died.
888,"01:09:59,400","01:10:01,440",He stepped too hard on the gas.
889,"01:10:02,120","01:10:03,800","- I'm sorry.
- What about you, Nick?"
890,"01:10:03,880","01:10:06,360",How did you get into this gang culture?
891,"01:10:06,440","01:10:09,720","- I don't wanna talk about the past.
- Grew up without a mother"
892,"01:10:09,800","01:10:12,000","and ran away.
He wanted to be a rebel."
893,"01:10:12,080","01:10:14,680","- Enough, Anna.
- Daddy canceled his credit cards,"
894,"01:10:14,760","01:10:18,360","and in Mexico, he met Lion,
who taught him how to live dangerously."
895,"01:10:18,440","01:10:20,400",Then he hooked up with his bestie.
896,"01:10:20,480","01:10:22,400","You don't have a dark past, Anna?"
897,"01:10:22,480","01:10:26,760","No way. My life has been very boring.
Maybe if I'd met you sooner..."
898,"01:10:26,840","01:10:29,560","- She was the classic school bully.
- Screw you."
899,"01:10:29,640","01:10:32,800","Did you send anonymous notes
to the girls you didn't like?"
900,"01:10:32,880","01:10:34,640",She ripped their eyes straight out.
901,"01:10:51,880","01:10:54,240","So I need
to get to know you better, right?"
902,"01:10:54,320","01:10:56,320","- That was a long time ago.
- Wait."
903,"01:10:57,200","01:10:58,800",I have something for you.
904,"01:10:59,880","01:11:01,400","I owed you a car, right?"
905,"01:11:03,000","01:11:06,000","It's perfect.
You can't sneak into this one."
906,"01:11:06,960","01:11:10,000","But seeing you in that uniform
was the best gift."
907,"01:11:10,080","01:11:14,200","I was going to get you a poetry book,
but I see that's not your thing."
908,"01:11:15,320","01:11:18,200","No! I don't want Anna
to rip my eyeballs out."
909,"01:11:18,280","01:11:21,720","This had never happened to me
with Anna or anyone else."
910,"01:11:21,800","01:11:24,000","It's the first time
I can't control myself."
911,"01:11:26,400","01:11:27,840",Mario is waiting for me.
912,"01:11:27,920","01:11:29,880",What does he want from you?
913,"01:11:30,440","01:11:32,400",I just know he smiles when he sees me.
914,"01:11:32,480","01:11:34,440",Are you going to settle for a smile?
915,"01:11:34,520","01:11:36,320",Until our faces hurt.
916,"01:11:36,400","01:11:40,480","That guy has no blood in his veins.
He can't give you what you need."
917,"01:11:41,360","01:11:42,720",What do I need?
918,"01:11:56,480","01:12:01,120","You don't need kisses,
you need volcanic eruptions in your mouth."
919,"01:12:05,520","01:12:07,640","You don't need caresses,"
920,"01:12:07,720","01:12:11,120","you need furrows
burying in deeply until you shiver."
921,"01:12:15,920","01:12:18,360",Vertigo-inducing whispers in your ear.
922,"01:12:30,600","01:12:35,120","You don't need pleasure, you need shivers."
923,"01:12:48,920","01:12:50,440",We didn't see a thing.
924,"01:12:51,080","01:12:54,400",Well? Was that poetic enough?
925,"01:12:54,480","01:12:56,720",We now have a car for the races.
926,"01:12:56,800","01:12:58,880",Added 100 horsepower to Jenna's car.
927,"01:12:58,960","01:13:00,680",You can borrow it anytime.
928,"01:13:02,840","01:13:05,560","Dude, are you crazy?
Isn't she your stepsister?"
929,"01:13:05,640","01:13:07,960","- So?
- Isn't that like incest?"
930,"01:13:08,040","01:13:11,160","After that beating
and what you were doing to him,"
931,"01:13:11,240","01:13:13,680",he won't have any strength left to fight.
932,"01:13:14,520","01:13:15,520",Fight?
933,"01:13:28,120","01:13:32,000","You guys don't settle
on going for a coffee or watching a movie."
934,"01:13:38,720","01:13:40,080","Hit him, Bruno!"
935,"01:13:57,400","01:13:58,560",Nick!
936,"01:13:58,640","01:14:01,920","- Don't do this.
- It's okay. He won't even touch me."
937,"01:14:02,000","01:14:03,520",This is nonsense.
938,"01:14:03,600","01:14:06,280","- Isn't it exciting?
- Getting hurt excites you?"
939,"01:14:06,360","01:14:08,840","- Pain doesn't bother me.
- And your opponent?"
940,"01:14:08,920","01:14:10,600",Do you enjoy hurting others?
941,"01:14:11,680","01:14:13,120","No, I just like to fight."
942,"01:14:13,720","01:14:14,880","Well, I don't get it."
943,"01:14:15,440","01:14:17,560","- It's a way to blow off steam.
- From what?"
944,"01:14:17,640","01:14:20,440","What trauma do you have
that's making you do this?"
945,"01:14:21,080","01:14:22,080",Leave him alone.
946,"01:14:22,760","01:14:24,160",I'm sick of you!
947,"01:14:25,600","01:14:28,400",What the hell is this idiot's problem?
948,"01:14:28,480","01:14:31,280","Are you going to let her
soften you up? Come on."
949,"01:14:31,360","01:14:32,360","Go, Nick!"
950,"01:15:14,880","01:15:16,880","Hey, Nick is fighting!"
951,"01:15:18,440","01:15:21,360","What is this shit? Did you know
it would be like this?"
952,"01:15:21,440","01:15:24,480","- Kind of.
- Just for fun. This is obscene."
953,"01:15:24,560","01:15:27,520","What if they beat up
a homeless person tomorrow?"
954,"01:15:27,600","01:15:31,520","Forget about all that, okay?
Because it's not worth it."
955,"01:15:33,880","01:15:35,760","- Go on, show him!
- You got him!"
956,"01:15:42,920","01:15:44,360","- Go on!
- Come on!"
957,"01:15:50,120","01:15:52,160",Nick! Nick! Nick!
958,"01:16:06,640","01:16:10,160","I wanted to thank you
for asking me to come with you today."
959,"01:16:10,240","01:16:11,680",It made me very happy.
960,"01:16:11,760","01:16:13,480",Sorry it was such short notice...
961,"01:16:17,160","01:16:20,280","I don't want this jerk
putting his hands on you again!"
962,"01:16:20,360","01:16:22,680",Who the fuck do you think you are?
963,"01:16:22,760","01:16:25,600","- Mario, I'm sorry.
- It's fine. I'm okay."
964,"01:16:26,280","01:16:30,000","Of course, I guessed
something was going on."
965,"01:16:33,120","01:16:34,960","Mario, you can't walk home."
966,"01:16:37,520","01:16:39,680",What the fuck do you think you're doing?
967,"01:16:40,800","01:16:41,920",I don't know.
968,"01:16:42,920","01:16:45,360",I've never felt jealous of anyone before.
969,"01:16:47,080","01:16:48,320",You drive me crazy.
970,"01:16:49,680","01:16:51,600",So this is all you can offer me?
971,"01:16:52,240","01:16:53,960",This can't ever happen again.
972,"01:16:54,040","01:16:57,560","- I swear I won't do it again.
- No, nothing can happen between us."
973,"01:16:58,840","01:17:00,000",Ever again.
974,"01:17:01,080","01:17:04,280",What? Why? What's wrong?
975,"01:17:04,360","01:17:07,440","- You're hurting me.
- Stop messing with my head."
976,"01:17:07,520","01:17:09,720","- What's wrong with you?
- Don't you see?"
977,"01:17:10,440","01:17:12,560","- I'm scared.
- Scared of what?"
978,"01:17:12,640","01:17:15,120","Besides the dark, like a little girl."
979,"01:17:17,200","01:17:18,200",Of you.
980,"01:17:20,920","01:17:23,680","I can't have a violent person
in my life again."
981,"01:17:32,520","01:17:33,960","Everything okay, Noah?"
982,"01:17:34,880","01:17:36,240",Need a ride home?
983,"01:17:39,040","01:17:42,000",Mario! Jenna's taking us home.
984,"01:17:42,080","01:17:43,520",Pick me up on the way!
985,"01:19:10,880","01:19:12,440",I taught her the basics.
986,"01:19:12,520","01:19:15,040","The brake,
the gas pedal, the gear shift..."
987,"01:19:44,240","01:19:47,840","I'M VERY CLOSE NOW. CAN YOU FEEL
THE PAIN OF MY PRESENCE?"
988,"01:19:53,560","01:19:55,760",I need to tell you something about Noah.
989,"01:19:55,840","01:19:58,040",Did you know her dad tried to kill her?
990,"01:19:58,680","01:20:00,240","- What?
- With a knife."
991,"01:20:00,320","01:20:02,640","He'd never touched her before.
Only Rafaella."
992,"01:20:02,720","01:20:05,000","- He hit Rafaella?
- That's right, son."
993,"01:20:05,760","01:20:07,560",There are people like that.
994,"01:20:07,640","01:20:10,360","Violence is their way
of blowing off steam."
995,"01:20:12,440","01:20:14,120",Why are you telling me this?
996,"01:20:14,200","01:20:17,840","Rafaella is scared he'll come back
to try and hurt Noah."
997,"01:20:17,920","01:20:20,120","- Come back from the grave?
- The grave?"
998,"01:20:20,200","01:20:21,760",He was sent to prison.
999,"01:20:21,840","01:20:24,080","- Wasn't he dead?
- No. If only."
1000,"01:20:24,160","01:20:27,640","His sentence was reduced.
He was released two weeks ago."
1001,"01:20:27,720","01:20:30,600",We've asked Esteban to accompany Noah.
1002,"01:20:30,680","01:20:33,080",But you know her. Noah with a driver...
1003,"01:20:33,880","01:20:35,960",So we thought that you could do it.
1004,"01:20:36,680","01:20:38,760",Why do you think he wants to hurt her?
1005,"01:20:38,840","01:20:41,680","Because Noah's testimony
was key in convicting him."
1006,"01:20:41,760","01:20:44,200","It's all here, take a look."
1007,"01:20:44,280","01:20:46,440","That man is dangerous, Nick."
1008,"01:20:48,040","01:20:50,280","- Does she know he's out?
- No."
1009,"01:20:50,360","01:20:52,680","- Rafaella didn't want to worry her.
- Why?"
1010,"01:20:53,440","01:20:55,480",She's terrified of her father.
1011,"01:21:19,240","01:21:20,240",Drink.
1012,"01:21:24,840","01:21:26,240","Okay, ready?"
1013,"01:21:39,080","01:21:41,840",That guy's all bark but no bite.
1014,"01:21:41,920","01:21:45,000","Where are all the cool guys
who whisper you sweet things?"
1015,"01:21:45,080","01:21:46,440",NICK - DECLINE
1016,"01:21:47,120","01:21:49,280","- Those guys don't exist.
- Yeah."
1017,"01:21:50,200","01:21:51,480","I like you, girl."
1018,"01:21:53,480","01:21:55,920","See? Why can't they say ""I love you""?"
1019,"01:21:56,000","01:21:58,480","They say ""I love you""
before sleeping with you,"
1020,"01:21:58,560","01:22:01,520","- but what they mean is ""I want you.""
- Exactly!"
1021,"01:22:01,600","01:22:04,520","Of course, then they cum
and go quiet. Mistake!"
1022,"01:22:04,600","01:22:06,120",You have to say it after!
1023,"01:22:06,200","01:22:09,040","That's when it means something,
not before."
1024,"01:22:09,120","01:22:10,880",That's so deep.
1025,"01:22:11,680","01:22:12,760",Thanks.
1026,"01:22:14,720","01:22:16,240",Not even one?
1027,"01:22:20,160","01:22:22,480","Bro, liven up this party. It's depressing."
1028,"01:22:22,560","01:22:25,600","Leave it to me.
What's up? This looks like a funeral."
1029,"01:22:25,680","01:22:27,720",Let's party like there's no tomorrow!
1030,"01:22:32,680","01:22:35,240","- What's up, bro?
- Lion, is Noah with you?"
1031,"01:22:35,320","01:22:39,440","What's that? Hold on.
Hey! Turn the music down a notch! No..."
1032,"01:22:39,520","01:22:40,560",Lion!
1033,"01:22:42,120","01:22:42,960",No...
1034,"01:22:43,040","01:22:44,240",Fuck!
1035,"01:22:47,360","01:22:51,400","You have to turn up in a pimped-out car,
but the party is indoors?"
1036,"01:22:51,480","01:22:53,120",That's absurd.
1037,"01:22:53,200","01:22:56,200","Since Nick isn't here, the fun is over."
1038,"01:22:58,720","01:23:00,400",Shall we get out of here?
1039,"01:23:05,440","01:23:07,160",Such pretty flowers!
1040,"01:23:09,760","01:23:11,960",You see how you can't drive?
1041,"01:23:14,200","01:23:15,240",NICK - CALLING
1042,"01:23:24,400","01:23:29,280","Hey, Nick, can you come
to Mikel's to get Noah's car?"
1043,"01:23:29,360","01:23:31,560",It's best if we take a taxi.
1044,"01:23:31,640","01:23:33,760","Yeah, she's wasted."
1045,"01:23:34,400","01:23:35,960",There's no way she's driving.
1046,"01:23:36,040","01:23:37,080",All right.
1047,"01:23:37,160","01:23:39,160","Shit, brother, you're going to kill me!"
1048,"01:23:39,240","01:23:42,080","Don't sneak up on me like that.
You scared me."
1049,"01:23:42,160","01:23:43,800",You too?
1050,"01:23:46,240","01:23:49,800","- Are you okay, Freckles?
- I'm perfectly okay to drive."
1051,"01:23:49,880","01:23:52,120",You don't need a license to drive these.
1052,"01:23:52,200","01:23:55,160","All this bullshit
she's pulling is because of you."
1053,"01:23:55,240","01:23:56,440",Where's the handle?
1054,"01:23:57,480","01:23:58,880",I forgot my blazer.
1055,"01:23:59,800","01:24:03,240","- I'll be right back.
- She's been out of control for two weeks."
1056,"01:24:03,320","01:24:05,800",Don't you think it's time you apologized?
1057,"01:24:06,840","01:24:09,640","- You're a good friend.
- She's a snitch!"
1058,"01:24:17,040","01:24:19,240","- What are you looking for?
- My blazer."
1059,"01:24:19,920","01:24:21,280",It's in the closet.
1060,"01:24:28,520","01:24:29,680",Anna!
1061,"01:24:29,760","01:24:32,240","Anna, no! Open the door, please!"
1062,"01:24:32,320","01:24:34,280",Are you looking for the light switch?
1063,"01:24:34,360","01:24:36,520","Please, it's not fucking funny!"
1064,"01:24:36,600","01:24:38,520",The door is jammed.
1065,"01:24:39,080","01:24:41,200","Anna! Help, please!"
1066,"01:24:47,120","01:24:49,160","Anna! Anna, open the door, please!"
1067,"01:24:55,440","01:24:57,440",Nobody is going to let you out.
1068,"01:24:57,520","01:25:00,240",What's the matter? Did you see a monster?
1069,"01:25:01,640","01:25:02,840",Where's your mother?
1070,"01:25:04,320","01:25:07,640",Where is your mother?
1071,"01:25:08,360","01:25:09,840","Anna, open up! Open up!"
1072,"01:25:11,320","01:25:13,480","- What happened?
- He's in there."
1073,"01:25:14,360","01:25:17,320","- There's no one there.
- You're the fucking monster!"
1074,"01:25:17,400","01:25:18,520",Come on. Let's go.
1075,"01:25:19,800","01:25:20,960",It was just a joke.
1076,"01:25:48,520","01:25:50,800",Why did you tell me your dad was dead?
1077,"01:25:52,120","01:25:55,960","Because he is to me.
I hope he rots in jail."
1078,"01:26:00,200","01:26:01,320","Please, don't go."
1079,"01:26:14,840","01:26:17,680","Why do you make it
so hard for me to hate you?"
1080,"01:26:21,080","01:26:24,000","I would do everything to you,
Noah, you know that."
1081,"01:26:25,240","01:26:29,160","But we won't do anything
until there's no fear left in your eyes."
1082,"01:26:31,560","01:26:35,120",That's so sweet. So cute.
1083,"01:26:43,280","01:26:45,320","Hey, about your dad, I wanted..."
1084,"01:27:04,880","01:27:08,000","Good morning, Freckles. Are you okay?"
1085,"01:27:09,840","01:27:13,520","I thought you couldn't control yourself
when you're by my side."
1086,"01:27:17,000","01:27:19,320",I should go before everyone wakes up.
1087,"01:27:20,160","01:27:21,440",Yeah.
1088,"01:27:25,480","01:27:26,960","Noah, have you seen..."
1089,"01:27:28,880","01:27:29,880",Dad...
1090,"01:27:30,520","01:27:32,640","Listen, I... She just couldn't..."
1091,"01:27:32,720","01:27:34,640",It's Maggie. She's in the hospital.
1092,"01:27:35,400","01:27:37,880",Maggie? What happened?
1093,"01:27:38,520","01:27:39,840",I think you should go.
1094,"01:27:52,880","01:27:54,120",Maggie!
1095,"01:27:55,000","01:27:56,040",Nick!
1096,"01:27:56,120","01:27:59,200","- How are you, honey?
- Much better."
1097,"01:27:59,280","01:28:03,160","- You gave us a real scare.
- I wanted to scare the nurse."
1098,"01:28:03,240","01:28:08,000","I hid behind the drapes
and turned off the cell phone alarm."
1099,"01:28:08,080","01:28:09,920","That alarm is horrible, right?"
1100,"01:28:12,120","01:28:13,960","Don't ever do that again, okay?"
1101,"01:28:14,680","01:28:17,680",Okay. Where is Mommy?
1102,"01:28:18,880","01:28:20,840","She'll be here soon, don't worry."
1103,"01:28:20,920","01:28:23,360",Is that Noah? She doesn't look that rude.
1104,"01:28:24,840","01:28:28,560","No, she's not. She's amazing
once you get to know her."
1105,"01:28:32,640","01:28:34,120",Good morning.
1106,"01:28:34,800","01:28:35,880",Hello.
1107,"01:28:37,040","01:28:39,680",Isn't he the best brother ever?
1108,"01:28:41,360","01:28:42,360",He is.
1109,"01:28:43,320","01:28:45,160",Once you get to know him.
1110,"01:28:45,240","01:28:47,240",But you'll always be his favorite.
1111,"01:28:47,320","01:28:50,400","The shock was critical,
but she's out of danger now."
1112,"01:28:51,600","01:28:53,920","Thank God. Thank you, Doctor."
1113,"01:28:54,000","01:28:55,880",Lucky the nurse was at home.
1114,"01:28:56,920","01:29:00,560","She doesn't need a nurse.
She needs a mother."
1115,"01:29:02,520","01:29:05,160","For now, she should get some rest."
1116,"01:29:20,440","01:29:22,120",We'll be home soon.
1117,"01:29:37,400","01:29:38,680",What are you doing?
1118,"01:29:38,760","01:29:40,720",Are you kicking me out again?
1119,"01:29:48,720","01:29:50,360",All of this was my fault.
1120,"01:29:53,480","01:29:57,280","Instead of leaving you stranded that day,
I should've kissed you."
1121,"01:30:03,160","01:30:05,440",If I'd known earlier about your dad...
1122,"01:30:06,200","01:30:09,160","It hurts me to see you're scared of me.
It hurts so much."
1123,"01:30:11,120","01:30:14,600","But you know I'd never hurt you.
You know that."
1124,"01:30:15,360","01:30:18,560","They know about us.
There's no time for apologies."
1125,"01:30:18,640","01:30:22,560","If loving each other is a sin,
then yes, we're guilty."
1126,"01:30:22,640","01:30:26,800","The guiltiest people in the world.
But your mom has to understand."
1127,"01:30:26,880","01:30:29,600",No. I don't want to hurt her.
1128,"01:30:29,680","01:30:32,200",What she's found with your dad is amazing.
1129,"01:30:32,280","01:30:35,040","She deserves to have that.
We can't ruin it."
1130,"01:30:35,120","01:30:39,200","No. I couldn't bear it
if these were our last kisses."
1131,"01:30:41,360","01:30:43,520",These kisses will last forever.
1132,"01:30:51,200","01:30:53,400","If this is going to be the last time,"
1133,"01:30:54,080","01:30:56,200","why don't we make it our first, too?"
1134,"01:32:37,920","01:32:39,320",Wait.
1135,"01:32:39,440","01:32:40,720",You're not sure?
1136,"01:32:42,320","01:32:43,640","- I am.
- Yeah?"
1137,"01:32:46,240","01:32:48,720",Just promise me we will never forget it.
1138,"01:32:50,680","01:32:52,160",How could you doubt it?
1139,"01:34:19,960","01:34:21,800",No!
1140,"01:34:24,600","01:34:29,240","- So he had no teeth?
- We were eight."
1141,"01:34:29,320","01:34:30,960",What about your first kiss?
1142,"01:34:31,720","01:34:34,120",It was much later. I was nine.
1143,"01:34:35,360","01:34:37,960","Yeah, playing with Jenna. A chain game."
1144,"01:34:38,040","01:34:41,720","I kissed someone who then kissed her,
and then she kissed me."
1145,"01:34:41,800","01:34:43,240",Who was that someone?
1146,"01:34:44,800","01:34:46,640","- Her hamster.
- No..."
1147,"01:34:46,720","01:34:47,800","- Yes...
- That's awful."
1148,"01:34:47,880","01:34:48,880",Yeah.
1149,"01:34:55,480","01:34:56,560",This was amazing.
1150,"01:34:57,640","01:34:59,040",This was wonderful.
1151,"01:35:06,120","01:35:08,480",The sun will rise in less than an hour.
1152,"01:35:09,920","01:35:12,880",Let's run away. Let's escape together.
1153,"01:35:14,000","01:35:15,200",That never works.
1154,"01:35:15,280","01:35:17,800","Look how the Montagues
and Capulets ended up."
1155,"01:35:17,880","01:35:20,960","- It worked for Casanova.
- He didn't run away for love."
1156,"01:35:21,040","01:35:22,400",He escaped from prison.
1157,"01:35:22,480","01:35:24,440",And didn't Blood Wedding end well?
1158,"01:35:32,080","01:35:34,680","- What are you doing?
- Making the most of our time."
1159,"01:35:36,600","01:35:38,720",You're bad. So bad.
1160,"01:35:38,800","01:35:42,160","- Why?
- Because I'm out of condoms."
1161,"01:35:57,000","01:35:58,840",10.50 euros.
1162,"01:36:01,200","01:36:03,600",I just texted you. That was fast.
1163,"01:36:03,680","01:36:06,760","- See how I'm the fastest?
- Nick!"
1164,"01:36:09,800","01:36:10,800",Nick!
1165,"01:36:12,440","01:36:15,640",NOAH: I'M STILL ON FIRE
1166,"01:36:21,960","01:36:24,480","- Transaction denied.
- What?"
1167,"01:36:25,240","01:36:26,400",Try this one.
1168,"01:36:27,240","01:36:29,320","Quickly, please, she's waiting for me."
1169,"01:36:30,800","01:36:31,920",Nick!
1170,"01:36:33,480","01:36:34,480",Bastard!
1171,"01:36:35,200","01:36:38,000","Now I'm going to give you
that ride in my car."
1172,"01:36:40,520","01:36:42,080","- Thank you.
- You're welcome."
1173,"01:36:51,160","01:36:52,200",Noah!
1174,"01:36:54,240","01:36:55,400",Noah!
1175,"01:36:57,200","01:36:58,320",Fuck!
1176,"01:37:05,440","01:37:07,440",NATIONAL POLICE CORPS
1177,"01:37:13,200","01:37:15,400",Impossible. They're not distinguishable.
1178,"01:37:15,480","01:37:16,680",That's Ronnie.
1179,"01:37:16,760","01:37:19,440","I'd recognize that bastard's shadow
in a dark well."
1180,"01:37:19,520","01:37:20,640",Are you sure?
1181,"01:37:21,440","01:37:23,960",Very well. We'll request a warrant.
1182,"01:37:24,040","01:37:25,720","- Thank you.
- Thank you, Detective."
1183,"01:37:25,800","01:37:26,800",You're welcome.
1184,"01:37:32,880","01:37:36,960","- I'm sorry. I should've told you...
- Leave me be, please. Just go."
1185,"01:37:39,200","01:37:40,440",Nicholas.
1186,"01:37:42,040","01:37:45,120","If Noah gets out of this,
don't ever touch her again."
1187,"01:37:45,920","01:37:47,720","The fights, the races..."
1188,"01:37:47,800","01:37:50,840","I should've realized
when you missed the gala."
1189,"01:37:50,920","01:37:52,720",You promised me that was over.
1190,"01:37:53,760","01:37:56,920","Are you really my son?
I don't recognize you."
1191,"01:38:06,880","01:38:09,040",They'll find her.
1192,"01:38:19,920","01:38:21,040",Fuck.
1193,"01:38:29,120","01:38:32,040","Fuck, Ronnie! You perverted motherfucker!"
1194,"01:38:32,120","01:38:34,880","I'll give you
a five-second head start to run away!"
1195,"01:38:34,960","01:38:38,240","All this because I beat you in a car race.
You're crazy!"
1196,"01:38:40,480","01:38:42,040",You beat him in a race?
1197,"01:38:44,360","01:38:46,440","- Dad.
- What a bastard, Ronnie."
1198,"01:38:47,120","01:38:48,480",He didn't tell me.
1199,"01:38:50,280","01:38:51,280",Well done.
1200,"01:38:52,080","01:38:53,280",That's my girl.
1201,"01:38:56,440","01:38:57,480",How was it?
1202,"01:39:00,240","01:39:01,960","Well, it doesn't matter."
1203,"01:39:02,040","01:39:04,920","I'm just glad
I taught you something useful."
1204,"01:39:06,360","01:39:08,560",I wasn't such a bad father after all.
1205,"01:39:15,320","01:39:17,240",Did you like the letters I sent you?
1206,"01:39:19,360","01:39:21,280",I'd never written to you before.
1207,"01:39:21,920","01:39:24,400","I don't know,
I felt like I owed it to you."
1208,"01:39:28,280","01:39:31,560","We found letters in her room.
They seem to be anonymous."
1209,"01:39:38,840","01:39:40,720","- Unknown number.
- Answer it."
1210,"01:39:43,720","01:39:44,840",Hello?
1211,"01:39:45,760","01:39:47,280","- Mom!
- Noah!"
1212,"01:39:47,360","01:39:48,640",Mom!
1213,"01:39:49,160","01:39:51,320","I'm so disappointed in you, Rafaella."
1214,"01:39:55,640","01:39:58,520","Jonás, don't you dare hurt Noah."
1215,"01:39:58,600","01:40:03,600","In all these years,
you never visited me once."
1216,"01:40:04,920","01:40:05,920",Not once.
1217,"01:40:06,800","01:40:08,120","Oh, Rafaella..."
1218,"01:40:08,200","01:40:11,480","In jail, everyone dreams
of being a gold digger like you."
1219,"01:40:11,560","01:40:13,240",Don't talk to my wife that way!
1220,"01:40:14,400","01:40:15,520","""My wife,"" he says."
1221,"01:40:17,720","01:40:19,800","- What do you want?
- I don't know."
1222,"01:40:19,880","01:40:23,600","I see you all enjoying the things
that money can buy and I think,"
1223,"01:40:24,280","01:40:27,040","""Shit, but I'm also part of the family."""
1224,"01:40:27,120","01:40:29,480","- How much?
- A million."
1225,"01:40:31,160","01:40:33,800","- To which account number?
- By Bizum. Would that be okay?"
1226,"01:40:33,880","01:40:37,360","Cash, non-sequential bills,
in a black, waterproof bag."
1227,"01:40:37,440","01:40:40,600","At the statue
on the promenade, at 4:00 p.m."
1228,"01:40:41,760","01:40:45,520","The two of you, and no police, of course."
1229,"01:40:46,960","01:40:48,040",Noah! Are you okay?
1230,"01:40:48,120","01:40:49,400",Nick!
1231,"01:40:53,160","01:40:54,920","Oh, brotherly love..."
1232,"01:41:01,760","01:41:02,920",We've got something.
1233,"01:41:03,000","01:41:05,760","Your ex-husband and Ronnie
were in jail together."
1234,"01:41:05,840","01:41:07,440",They shared a cell.
1235,"01:41:12,480","01:41:15,480","If I don't call you in two hours,
something's wrong."
1236,"01:41:15,560","01:41:18,040","Are you sure about this?
She's your daughter."
1237,"01:41:18,640","01:41:20,360",She beat you in a race?
1238,"01:41:20,440","01:41:22,720","- Yeah, well, she cheated.
- Right..."
1239,"01:41:24,520","01:41:26,520",You'd like to get back at her?
1240,"01:41:26,600","01:41:30,400","- That's not on my mind right now.
- It's not on your mind. Right."
1241,"01:41:54,280","01:41:55,960",Why is he taking so long?
1242,"01:42:00,320","01:42:01,400",Unbelievable!
1243,"01:42:04,680","01:42:07,000","You think this is one
of your illegal races?"
1244,"01:42:07,080","01:42:09,440",I'm not going to stand by and do nothing.
1245,"01:42:30,480","01:42:33,760","Don't worry, honey.
Everything is going to be okay."
1246,"01:42:38,720","01:42:39,920",He won't show up.
1247,"01:42:40,560","01:42:41,720",Why do you say that?
1248,"01:42:41,800","01:42:46,440","He couldn't care less about the money.
He just wants to see Noah and me suffer."
1249,"01:42:48,560","01:42:49,880",Don't worry.
1250,"01:42:55,240","01:42:56,680",I don't like this.
1251,"01:42:59,680","01:43:02,160",Is it true you lost one of those in a bet?
1252,"01:43:03,520","01:43:05,880","The idea wasn't to lose it, ma'am."
1253,"01:43:05,960","01:43:09,520","Ronnie cheated. It still pisses me off
seeing him show off in it."
1254,"01:43:09,600","01:43:12,440","Especially because
I'm still paying for the insurance."
1255,"01:43:13,000","01:43:14,000",That's it!
1256,"01:43:14,800","01:43:17,280",The insurance! The insurance's tracker!
1257,"01:43:19,840","01:43:21,200",Attention all units!
1258,"01:43:24,080","01:43:25,480",They found them.
1259,"01:43:44,200","01:43:45,040",This is it.
1260,"01:43:45,120","01:43:47,520",LÓPEZ'S GARAGE
1261,"01:43:47,600","01:43:48,800",Okay.
1262,"01:43:58,080","01:43:59,440",Noah.
1263,"01:44:00,600","01:44:03,240","Be informed, he's on the run
in a red sports car."
1264,"01:44:09,400","01:44:10,600",Unit two!
1265,"01:44:27,440","01:44:28,560",Okay. The roundabout.
1266,"01:44:39,480","01:44:40,680",No! Stop!
1267,"01:44:40,760","01:44:41,920",Get the fuck off me.
1268,"01:44:46,000","01:44:47,680","- Are you okay? Noah!
- You?"
1269,"01:44:48,920","01:44:51,320","Why do this?
Just take the money and go."
1270,"01:44:51,400","01:44:56,480","You're engaging the clutch too soon.
Don't release until it starts to struggle."
1271,"01:45:22,960","01:45:24,200","Come on, faster!"
1272,"01:45:33,200","01:45:34,200","That's it, good."
1273,"01:45:40,800","01:45:41,840",Good job.
1274,"01:45:43,040","01:45:44,320",Why did you do it?
1275,"01:45:44,880","01:45:48,080","Why weren't you like you
always were when we drove together?"
1276,"01:45:48,160","01:45:49,680","Like now, right?"
1277,"01:45:49,760","01:45:52,400","- We were a team, I was happy.
- Shit, so was I."
1278,"01:45:52,480","01:45:54,120","What a great year, remember?"
1279,"01:45:54,200","01:45:57,720","Coming first overall... Two races away
from being world champion."
1280,"01:45:57,800","01:46:00,880","Two easy races, and you both ruined it."
1281,"01:46:02,800","01:46:04,080","World champion, Noah."
1282,"01:46:05,200","01:46:08,560","But no, to hell with the championship,
my career, everything."
1283,"01:46:09,960","01:46:14,840","Do you have any idea
what it's like to go for years, years"
1284,"01:46:14,920","01:46:17,600","without laying my hands
on a steering wheel?"
1285,"01:46:18,440","01:46:21,920","Without a car,
my favorite thing in the world!"
1286,"01:46:22,000","01:46:24,320","It's like not living, Noah!"
1287,"01:46:24,400","01:46:26,960","Your lives should've ended too, like mine!"
1288,"01:46:27,040","01:46:29,600","You shouldn't have come.
You killed us back then."
1289,"01:46:29,680","01:46:33,440","Doesn't look like it.
You seem happy, living the sweet life."
1290,"01:46:34,640","01:46:35,640",Get down!
1291,"01:46:39,600","01:46:40,600",No!
1292,"01:46:45,400","01:46:46,400",Shit.
1293,"01:47:25,600","01:47:26,800",End of the race.
1294,"01:47:52,800","01:47:53,880",What are you doing?
1295,"01:47:57,600","01:47:59,040",Are you trying to kill us?
1296,"01:47:59,120","01:48:01,600",Does it matter? We're already dead.
1297,"01:48:50,520","01:48:51,520",Noah.
1298,"01:48:51,680","01:48:52,680",Thank you.
1299,"01:49:04,720","01:49:06,000",Mom!
1300,"01:49:06,080","01:49:07,080",Noah!
1301,"01:49:09,200","01:49:10,200",Sweetie!
1302,"01:49:11,560","01:49:12,680",Are you all right?
1303,"01:49:12,760","01:49:14,320",Did he do anything to you?
1304,"01:49:20,960","01:49:22,000",Thank you.
1305,"01:50:04,680","01:50:05,840",Ma'am.
1306,"01:50:05,920","01:50:07,080","Come on in, Petra."
1307,"01:50:28,120","01:50:31,360",Thank you for coming. I couldn't be alone.
1308,"01:50:32,680","01:50:34,480",No one will ever hurt you again.
1309,"01:50:35,120","01:50:36,120",Ever.
1310,"01:50:54,080","01:50:55,280",I love you.
1311,"01:51:00,320","01:51:01,760","Wait, what did you say?"
1312,"01:51:01,840","01:51:03,400",I said I love you.
1313,"01:51:04,120","01:51:07,840","- I can't believe it. Did Jenna tell you?
- What?"
1314,"01:51:07,920","01:51:10,760","- About saying ""I love you"" in this moment.
- No."
1315,"01:51:12,600","01:51:14,080","Okay, it was Lion."
1316,"01:51:16,800","01:51:19,280","- But I would've told you anyway.
- I doubt it."
1317,"01:51:20,680","01:51:21,840","Well, believe it."
1318,"01:51:23,400","01:51:24,520",Because it's true.
1319,"01:51:39,840","01:51:42,920","So how long do we have to stay
in each other's arms now?"
1320,"01:51:47,680","01:51:49,080","For a long time, I hope."
1321,"01:51:50,880","01:51:53,200",Because this is where our story begins.
1322,"01:52:15,520","01:52:17,160","Will, we need to do something."
1323,"01:52:17,240","01:52:19,200","Anything, but this has to stop. Now."
