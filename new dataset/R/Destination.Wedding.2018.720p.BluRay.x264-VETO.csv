2,"00:00:52,201","00:00:54,498","Why wouldn't we
bring up the first amendment?"
3,"00:00:54,500","00:00:57,764","We have to stick to the constitution.
That is what made this country."
4,"00:01:25,834","00:01:27,167",Don't die.
5,"00:01:29,766","00:01:31,666","Come on, photosynthesis."
6,"00:02:14,901","00:02:18,065","- That's a nice dress.
- Oh. Thank you."
7,"00:02:18,067","00:02:20,134","- I like your jacket.
- Thanks."
8,"00:02:22,500","00:02:26,165","- I hope our flight's on time.
- Oh, it is. See?"
9,"00:02:26,167","00:02:30,032","This airline has an excellent
arrival-departure record."
10,"00:02:30,034","00:02:31,932","Um, I Googled it."
11,"00:02:31,934","00:02:34,832","And, um, it has a 98..."
12,"00:02:34,834","00:02:37,132","No 96,
no 98 percent approval..."
13,"00:02:37,134","00:02:39,597","online user
approval rating."
14,"00:02:39,599","00:02:42,099","Which is very incredibly
high, obviously."
15,"00:02:42,101","00:02:45,732","Um, and Rancho Cucamonga
Mary sent me three,"
16,"00:02:45,734","00:02:49,633","who I trust implicitly,
was very effusive about it."
17,"00:02:52,034","00:02:53,901","- Yeah.
- And you get a snack."
18,"00:02:54,901","00:02:56,530",Great.
19,"00:02:57,934","00:02:59,899","- I'm sorry, what was that?
- What?"
20,"00:02:59,901","00:03:01,530","You just took
a step forward there."
21,"00:03:01,532","00:03:03,932","- I didn't.
- Yeah, you did. You know you did."
22,"00:03:03,934","00:03:05,832","- I didn't realize.
- Oh, I see."
23,"00:03:05,834","00:03:07,631",I beg your pardon?
24,"00:03:07,633","00:03:11,798","- I s-see what you did. I know what you did. It's...
- What did I do?"
25,"00:03:11,800","00:03:17,465","You came up alongside me, you know, with
your jacket and your face and charm,"
26,"00:03:17,467","00:03:21,232","and you just, you know, talked to
me for a strategic amount of time,"
27,"00:03:21,234","00:03:22,932","established your position,"
28,"00:03:22,934","00:03:26,798","and then just casually, blatantly
stepped in front of me."
29,"00:03:26,800","00:03:28,631","Like I had
some sort of amnesia"
30,"00:03:28,633","00:03:31,132","and couldn't remember 15 seconds in
the past when you were behind me."
31,"00:03:31,134","00:03:33,631",Untrue.
32,"00:03:33,633","00:03:35,832","Oh my... You just
did it again."
33,"00:03:35,834","00:03:39,065","This is like watching a
master at work in his dojo."
34,"00:03:39,067","00:03:40,965","- I mean...
- Here's what happened."
35,"00:03:40,967","00:03:43,765","I came to my gate, hoping
my flight was on time."
36,"00:03:43,767","00:03:45,832","I then attempted to start
a pleasant conversation,"
37,"00:03:45,834","00:03:48,765","whereupon you revealed the tip of
the iceberg of your tendencies,"
38,"00:03:48,767","00:03:51,698","and I was forced to take a step
forward to escape the vortex."
39,"00:03:51,700","00:03:54,932","Oh, my God.
Oh... Again! Oh!"
40,"00:03:54,934","00:03:58,232","And now you're casting me as the author
of a Byzantine conspiracy theory"
41,"00:03:58,234","00:04:00,597",of a Machiavellian land grab
42,"00:04:00,599","00:04:04,099","designed to usurp your position on
an aircraft that has eight seats."
43,"00:04:04,101","00:04:06,099",You know what? Okay.
44,"00:04:06,101","00:04:10,232","That's cra... If I'm wrong, just step in
back of me instead of in front of me."
45,"00:04:10,234","00:04:12,631","No, because that would mean
going past you again."
46,"00:04:12,633","00:04:15,631",I see. You know what?
47,"00:04:15,633","00:04:19,999","Five years ago, I would have said
something trite like, ""Chivalry is dead."""
48,"00:04:20,001","00:04:22,099","But this is worse
than unchivalrous."
49,"00:04:22,101","00:04:25,965","This is... You are
part and parcel of a world"
50,"00:04:25,967","00:04:28,999","that no longer has any
idea how to behave itself."
51,"00:04:29,001","00:04:32,597","In fact, I draw a straight
line between people like you"
52,"00:04:32,599","00:04:36,464","to investment bankers to
politicians to terrorists."
53,"00:04:36,466","00:04:41,132","You basically all have the same contempt
for decency and rules and any manners."
54,"00:04:41,134","00:04:44,765","And what's funny is there's
no way you can board first"
55,"00:04:44,767","00:04:47,132","because the only way you could board
first is if you had a special need."
56,"00:04:47,134","00:04:48,932","Do you have
a special need?"
57,"00:04:48,934","00:04:52,065","Yes, I need
to be over there."
58,"00:05:01,967","00:05:03,634",Fucker.
59,"00:05:30,934","00:05:32,734","- Fantastic.
- Wonderful."
60,"00:05:34,466","00:05:37,165","- Anybody want to trade seats?
- You're ridiculous."
61,"00:05:37,167","00:05:39,765","Anybody?
It's great back here."
62,"00:05:39,767","00:05:42,134","You've got
to be kidding me."
63,"00:05:46,634","00:05:47,734",Jesus.
64,"00:05:57,667","00:05:59,399","What brings you
to San Luis Obispo?"
65,"00:06:00,466","00:06:02,132","- You don't have to.
- What?"
66,"00:06:02,134","00:06:05,798","Talk. Honestly, I'd be
happier if you didn't."
67,"00:06:05,800","00:06:06,867",Fine.
68,"00:06:27,800","00:06:29,099","Dear God.
Tear it at the notch."
69,"00:06:29,101","00:06:31,464",There is no notch.
70,"00:06:31,466","00:06:33,232","- Give it to me.
- I'm not giving you..."
71,"00:06:33,234","00:06:34,234",Give it to me.
72,"00:06:49,500","00:06:52,134","This one does not appear
to have a working notch."
73,"00:06:59,001","00:07:00,001",Yeah.
74,"00:07:01,067","00:07:02,134",Yeah.
75,"00:07:10,101","00:07:11,667",All that...
76,"00:07:15,667","00:07:16,834",Thank you.
77,"00:07:38,634","00:07:40,634","I'm actually
going to Paso Robles."
78,"00:07:41,767","00:07:43,865","They call it Paso ""Roables."""
79,"00:07:43,867","00:07:46,231","Well, the correct
pronunciation is Robles."
80,"00:07:46,233","00:07:48,498","But they call it ""Roables."""
81,"00:07:48,500","00:07:50,099","- Whatever.
- I hope it's a big place."
82,"00:07:50,101","00:07:51,832",It isn't.
83,"00:07:51,834","00:07:54,531","If I see you at a restaurant,
I'll go to another restaurant."
84,"00:07:54,533","00:07:56,598","I'm not going to be
in any restaurants."
85,"00:07:56,600","00:07:59,965","Why? Are you checking
into a mental institution?"
86,"00:07:59,967","00:08:04,634","I'm going to that most presumptuous
of all things, a destination wedding."
87,"00:08:06,533","00:08:08,667","Please don't tell me
it's Keith and Anne's."
88,"00:08:10,800","00:08:13,032","How many weddings
can there possibly be"
89,"00:08:13,034","00:08:15,231","on any given day
in Paso Robles?"
90,"00:08:15,233","00:08:17,132",I was praying for two.
91,"00:08:17,134","00:08:19,798","And I was blaming Satan
for my seat assignment"
92,"00:08:19,800","00:08:22,498","when it was actually
just Keith's assistant."
93,"00:08:22,500","00:08:24,632","And how do you know
the esteemed Keith?"
94,"00:08:24,634","00:08:26,899","I was engaged to him
six years ago."
95,"00:08:26,901","00:08:29,665","- Oh, my God, you're Lindsay.
- Why, how do you know him?"
96,"00:08:29,667","00:08:31,498","He and I have
the same mother."
97,"00:08:31,500","00:08:33,001","Holy shit,
you're Frank?"
98,"00:08:34,567","00:08:36,965","Oh, you're even worse
than he said."
99,"00:08:36,967","00:08:38,632",You too.
100,"00:08:47,901","00:08:50,498","Oh, my God."
101,"00:08:50,500","00:08:52,001",Serious...
102,"00:09:19,600","00:09:22,164","- There was supposed to be a car.
- Our flight was early."
103,"00:09:22,166","00:09:23,899","Really?
It seemed so long."
104,"00:09:23,901","00:09:27,498","Attention, passengers,
increased security measures"
105,"00:09:27,500","00:09:29,665","require all passengers
to maintain"
106,"00:09:29,667","00:09:32,899","close personal contact
with your bags at all times."
107,"00:09:41,634","00:09:44,598","So how much do you know about what
happened between me and Keith?"
108,"00:09:44,600","00:09:47,198","I know that he broke off your engagement
five weeks before the wedding."
109,"00:09:47,200","00:09:48,798",And now I know why.
110,"00:09:48,800","00:09:50,765","He said some shit
about you, boy."
111,"00:09:50,767","00:09:52,965","- Like what?
- Doesn't matter."
112,"00:09:52,967","00:09:56,198","Don't do that, don't dangle an injurious
tidbit and then snatch it away."
113,"00:09:56,200","00:09:58,632","Or what, I'll die alone?"
114,"00:09:58,634","00:10:00,565","Keith is a panhandling
piece of garbage,"
115,"00:10:00,567","00:10:01,965","and you're better off
without him."
116,"00:10:01,967","00:10:05,032","Which is saying something,
considering how bad off you are."
117,"00:10:05,034","00:10:07,598","Just pity the bride,
whoever she is."
118,"00:10:07,600","00:10:10,732","- You haven't met her?
- Just like I never met you."
119,"00:10:10,734","00:10:13,531","I stay as far away
from Keith as I can."
120,"00:10:13,533","00:10:16,999","My mother insisted I turn up for this shit show,
otherwise, I wouldn't be meeting you now."
121,"00:10:17,001","00:10:19,465","Isn't that nice
to think about?"
122,"00:10:19,467","00:10:21,665","She said it's important to show
up because if you show up,"
123,"00:10:21,667","00:10:24,032","the worst they can say is you're
horrendous, which is subjective."
124,"00:10:24,034","00:10:26,498","But not showing up
is objective."
125,"00:10:26,500","00:10:27,867","Well, you showed up."
126,"00:10:29,001","00:10:30,665","Why would you come
to his wedding?"
127,"00:10:30,667","00:10:32,198","He broke your heart,
as I recall."
128,"00:10:32,200","00:10:34,131","Shattered, yes."
129,"00:10:34,133","00:10:35,798","Didn't you wind up
suing him?"
130,"00:10:35,800","00:10:37,965","Well, I needed to lash out."
131,"00:10:37,967","00:10:41,565","Plus he cost my parents
$32,000 in deposits."
132,"00:10:41,567","00:10:43,198","- Did you win?
- There was a settlement."
133,"00:10:43,200","00:10:44,899",Did you feel better?
134,"00:10:44,901","00:10:47,999","Look, I came
because he invited me."
135,"00:10:48,001","00:10:50,798","He only invited you because he
wanted to act like a big person,"
136,"00:10:50,800","00:10:53,832","not because he, in any way,
wanted you to come."
137,"00:10:53,834","00:10:58,732","You think I wanted to come? I'm
just trying to be the big person."
138,"00:10:58,734","00:11:01,867","See, this only works if one of
you actually is a big person."
139,"00:11:03,001","00:11:05,698","Well, also, I need closure."
140,"00:11:05,700","00:11:08,698","You don't have closure?
It was six years ago."
141,"00:11:08,700","00:11:11,665","Do I strike you as someone
who has closure?"
142,"00:11:11,667","00:11:14,064","He's marrying someone else.
That's closure."
143,"00:11:14,066","00:11:15,498",It's closed.
144,"00:11:15,500","00:11:18,665","Closed is not
the same thing as closure."
145,"00:11:28,867","00:11:30,734","Any chance
they sent two cars?"
146,"00:12:00,734","00:12:02,732","So, what do you do, Frank?"
147,"00:12:02,734","00:12:06,064","That is, when you're not shining
your light upon the world."
148,"00:12:06,066","00:12:08,498","I run marketing
for J.D. Power and Associates."
149,"00:12:08,500","00:12:10,199","The ""Car of the Year"" people?"
150,"00:12:10,201","00:12:11,998","No, that's a magazine."
151,"00:12:12,000","00:12:14,165","I bought one of your cars of the year.
It was a piece of crap."
152,"00:12:14,167","00:12:16,632","Again, a magazine.
Common error."
153,"00:12:16,634","00:12:18,199","Is that the career
you dreamed of?"
154,"00:12:18,201","00:12:20,865","Handing out awards
by the fistful?"
155,"00:12:20,867","00:12:23,798","Hugely successful company,
extremely well-respected."
156,"00:12:23,800","00:12:27,498","It's corporate brownnosing
on a national scale."
157,"00:12:27,500","00:12:29,765","International.
And don't sleep on awards."
158,"00:12:29,767","00:12:31,832","Our country lives
on self-congratulation."
159,"00:12:31,834","00:12:32,964",Let me ask you this.
160,"00:12:32,966","00:12:34,832",Has there ever been a car
161,"00:12:34,834","00:12:37,798","that wasn't a J.D. Power
and Associates Car of the Year?"
162,"00:12:37,800","00:12:40,165","We don't do ""Car of the
Year."" That's a magazine."
163,"00:12:40,167","00:12:41,998","I've seen those
Lucite trophies."
164,"00:12:42,000","00:12:44,767","They're on every car commercial
for every car, ever."
165,"00:12:48,867","00:12:51,232",What do you do anyway?
166,"00:12:51,234","00:12:54,232","I prosecute companies
and institutions"
167,"00:12:54,234","00:12:56,867","for culturally insensitive
actions or speech."
168,"00:12:59,100","00:13:01,132","You're the politically
correct police."
169,"00:13:01,134","00:13:02,798",No.
170,"00:13:02,800","00:13:04,998","You parse what people say and
do, and then accuse them"
171,"00:13:05,000","00:13:08,531","of being racist or misogynist
or otherwise horrible."
172,"00:13:08,533","00:13:10,665","You destroy lives
and reputations for money."
173,"00:13:10,667","00:13:12,465",No.
174,"00:13:12,467","00:13:14,867","Is that what you dreamed of?
A career in reverse fascism?"
175,"00:13:17,700","00:13:19,167",I can't remember dreaming.
176,"00:14:52,201","00:14:53,734",Wrong!
177,"00:14:57,034","00:14:59,101",I thought this was my closet.
178,"00:15:01,866","00:15:03,734","Are you expecting
a response of some kind?"
179,"00:15:04,900","00:15:06,565",No.
180,"00:15:06,567","00:15:10,565","Uh, I see now that there
is a bolt on the door."
181,"00:15:10,567","00:15:12,465","So, we should use it."
182,"00:15:12,467","00:15:13,767",Yep.
183,"00:15:59,733","00:16:02,165","- How's your room?
- I'm just sleeping there."
184,"00:16:02,167","00:16:03,831",How's yours?
185,"00:16:03,833","00:16:06,531","I'll let you know after I run
a UV light over the sheets."
186,"00:16:06,533","00:16:08,132","We really shouldn't
speak anymore."
187,"00:16:08,134","00:16:09,831",If you think that's best.
188,"00:16:09,833","00:16:11,665","Do you think Keith
is trying to fix us up?"
189,"00:16:11,667","00:16:12,932","Even he is smarter
than that."
190,"00:16:12,934","00:16:15,999","I don't know.
I mean, same flight."
191,"00:16:16,001","00:16:18,132","Seated next to each other
on the plane."
192,"00:16:18,134","00:16:20,632","Adjoining rooms.
Seated next to each other here."
193,"00:16:20,634","00:16:22,999","You think that's
all just coincidence?"
194,"00:16:23,001","00:16:26,465","Keith has never had a thought
about another human being."
195,"00:16:26,467","00:16:29,665","So we're just the people
you don't know where to stick?"
196,"00:16:29,667","00:16:31,764","Might as well
just stick us together."
197,"00:16:31,766","00:16:34,065","I don't want to be a person
you don't know where to stick."
198,"00:16:34,067","00:16:36,797","That is not the life
I imagined for myself."
199,"00:16:36,799","00:16:39,999","I'm sure your next life
will be better."
200,"00:16:40,001","00:16:43,831","Welp, here we go."
201,"00:16:43,833","00:16:44,899",So that's her.
202,"00:16:44,901","00:16:46,467",Yep.
203,"00:16:47,600","00:16:50,032","She is a tall glass
of hemlock."
204,"00:16:50,034","00:16:51,965","- She's Danish.
- Dutch, I thought."
205,"00:16:51,967","00:16:53,465","Danish.
From Denmark."
206,"00:16:53,467","00:16:55,199","I know where
Danish are from."
207,"00:16:55,201","00:16:56,965","He looks the same
as he used to."
208,"00:16:56,967","00:16:58,598",Plastic people don't age.
209,"00:16:58,600","00:17:00,165","Well, I was hoping he had."
210,"00:17:00,167","00:17:05,032","I was hoping he'd be less attractive
or on his way to obesity."
211,"00:17:05,034","00:17:07,867","Is this the first time you've seen
him since the crushing ending?"
212,"00:17:09,234","00:17:10,899","- Is it bad?
- Yep."
213,"00:17:10,901","00:17:13,134","- As bad as you feared?
- Yeah. Worse."
214,"00:17:16,167","00:17:20,132","- How can this be the way the species is set up?
- I'm sorry?"
215,"00:17:20,134","00:17:23,232","How can we be allowed
to feel so much for people"
216,"00:17:23,234","00:17:25,664","who don't feel
anything for us?"
217,"00:17:25,666","00:17:28,632","You're assuming that you're
normal, which is hilarious."
218,"00:17:28,634","00:17:31,797","- It's incredibly cruel.
- Well, look at it this way."
219,"00:17:31,799","00:17:35,065","For a time, you carved out a place in his life
when there really shouldn't have been one."
220,"00:17:35,067","00:17:36,731",That makes me a dipshit.
221,"00:17:36,733","00:17:39,032","I agree.
I was just humoring you."
222,"00:17:39,034","00:17:40,832","The truth is,
from puberty on in,"
223,"00:17:40,834","00:17:43,132","we should all just
be playing defense."
224,"00:17:43,134","00:17:45,633","- ""On in""? On in to what?
- Death."
225,"00:17:47,699","00:17:49,165","- Oh, God.
- Officer on deck."
226,"00:17:49,167","00:17:51,565","- So you got to know Mom.
- Plenty well enough."
227,"00:17:51,567","00:17:52,797",So you met her twice.
228,"00:17:54,967","00:17:56,598",Howard.
229,"00:17:56,600","00:18:00,232","- Oh, this fucking guy.
- Who's he with?"
230,"00:18:00,234","00:18:01,598",His girlfriend.
231,"00:18:01,600","00:18:03,232",Howard left your mother?
232,"00:18:03,234","00:18:06,199","""Left"" is not
a strong enough word. Fled."
233,"00:18:06,201","00:18:08,932","- For an older woman?
- He would have left for an otter."
234,"00:18:08,934","00:18:12,132","- Anyway, leaving is leaving.
- No, no."
235,"00:18:12,134","00:18:15,697","Leaving for a younger woman
is awful, it's horrible."
236,"00:18:15,699","00:18:19,498","But leaving for an older
woman is perverse."
237,"00:18:19,500","00:18:21,731","Mom would have been just
as angry about a younger one."
238,"00:18:21,733","00:18:24,065","Yeah, but she would've
been able to use her age"
239,"00:18:24,067","00:18:26,999","to rail against
a gender-unfair society."
240,"00:18:27,001","00:18:29,999","I mean, leaving for a younger
woman's the least he could've done."
241,"00:18:30,001","00:18:31,999","My father left her
for a younger woman."
242,"00:18:32,001","00:18:34,631","She can think about that,
when she wants to cheer up."
243,"00:18:34,633","00:18:38,032","But she and your father eventually
made peace though, didn't they?"
244,"00:18:38,034","00:18:40,199","Yep. Dad jumped out
a seventh-floor window,"
245,"00:18:40,201","00:18:42,099","and Mom considered them
all square."
246,"00:18:42,101","00:18:43,832","- I'm sorry?
- Don't be."
247,"00:18:43,834","00:18:45,597",I was not a fan.
248,"00:18:45,599","00:18:48,199","Well, you're not a fan of
many people, is my sense."
249,"00:18:48,201","00:18:49,999","Well, this person
shot me, so..."
250,"00:18:50,001","00:18:52,232","- He shot you?
- He did."
251,"00:18:52,234","00:18:55,765","He said I was the embodiment
of all his bad choices."
252,"00:18:55,767","00:18:58,165","- Did it hurt?
- Did it hurt?"
253,"00:18:58,167","00:18:59,932",Is that a serious question?
254,"00:18:59,934","00:19:01,832","There's a metal missile
going into your body."
255,"00:19:01,834","00:19:03,899","Yes, it hurt.
It hurt a great deal."
256,"00:19:03,901","00:19:05,865","Well, what did you do?"
257,"00:19:05,867","00:19:06,965",I ran at him.
258,"00:19:06,967","00:19:08,832",You ran at him?
259,"00:19:08,834","00:19:10,498","Why didn't you
run away from him?"
260,"00:19:10,500","00:19:12,664","That didn't occur to me.
I was pissed off."
261,"00:19:12,666","00:19:15,165","He tried to shoot me again,
but he missed."
262,"00:19:15,167","00:19:19,465","I got the gun out of his hand, hit him in
the face with it, broke his orbital bone."
263,"00:19:19,467","00:19:21,899","- What did he do?
- He cried."
264,"00:19:21,901","00:19:23,398","Begged me to kill him.
I wouldn't."
265,"00:19:23,400","00:19:26,564","Not because I didn't want to, but because
I didn't want to fuck up my life."
266,"00:19:26,566","00:19:29,032","I mean, any more
than it already was."
267,"00:19:29,034","00:19:30,697","Turned out I didn't
have to kill him though,"
268,"00:19:30,699","00:19:33,132","because that night,
he jumped."
269,"00:19:33,134","00:19:35,697",It's quite a family.
270,"00:19:35,699","00:19:38,032",Nobody's arguing.
271,"00:19:38,034","00:19:42,032","You can't call a
78-year-old woman your ""girlfriend."""
272,"00:19:42,034","00:19:43,530",It's ridiculous.
273,"00:19:43,532","00:19:44,932",What should I call her then?
274,"00:19:44,934","00:19:48,932","I don't know. An ossified,
pre-dead corpse-friend?"
275,"00:19:48,934","00:19:51,232","Is that in the politically
correct handbook?"
276,"00:19:51,234","00:19:53,232",I'm off the clock.
277,"00:19:53,234","00:19:55,132","She just needs a little
more hair and makeup."
278,"00:19:55,134","00:19:57,932","I think we passed
a mortician on the way in."
279,"00:19:57,934","00:19:59,631","Travel with her
on your arm,"
280,"00:19:59,633","00:20:02,165","you'd better know where the
funeral parlors are at all times."
281,"00:20:02,167","00:20:05,465","And by ""On your arm,""
you mean both figuratively"
282,"00:20:05,467","00:20:08,032","and for actual
physical support."
283,"00:20:08,034","00:20:10,597","- I've never met her.
- Better hurry."
284,"00:20:10,599","00:20:13,132","I guess the heart wants
what the heart wants."
285,"00:20:13,134","00:20:15,732","Or whatever the
pacemaker says it can have."
286,"00:20:15,734","00:20:17,530","Apparently,
they went to the same college."
287,"00:20:17,532","00:20:19,698","She was a senior
when he was a freshman."
288,"00:20:19,700","00:20:21,999","Well, she's a senior again."
289,"00:20:23,934","00:20:27,665","- Are you gonna say hello?
- Yep. Are you?"
290,"00:20:27,667","00:20:29,999",Yep.
291,"00:20:30,001","00:20:31,832",Have a nice time.
292,"00:21:40,767","00:21:44,032","- You okay?
- Nope. You?"
293,"00:21:44,034","00:21:46,134","I'm all fucked up
and I always will be."
294,"00:21:47,867","00:21:52,867","You think anyone will notice
if I... go back to the hotel?"
295,"00:21:54,201","00:21:55,201",Nope.
296,"00:21:56,067","00:21:57,067",Yeah.
297,"00:21:58,566","00:21:59,566",All right.
298,"00:22:19,734","00:22:22,632",Psst.
299,"00:22:22,634","00:22:27,034","I mean, not to throw
stones, but he has a lot going on."
300,"00:22:28,466","00:22:30,832","I mean... I mean, I know
I have mine,"
301,"00:22:30,834","00:22:33,199","but my father
never shot me."
302,"00:22:33,201","00:22:36,798","I don't think he ever
even touched a gun."
303,"00:22:36,800","00:22:41,032","I mean, there was that one time I
put those two boxes of Band-Aids"
304,"00:22:41,034","00:22:45,965","on my doll and he,
like, barely patted me."
305,"00:22:45,967","00:22:48,698","Like, you couldn't
even call it a spanking."
306,"00:22:48,700","00:22:53,899","It was like... He was
apologizing forever for it."
307,"00:22:53,901","00:22:55,134",And he still feels bad.
308,"00:22:57,466","00:23:00,565","I mean, seven floors."
309,"00:23:00,567","00:23:03,232","I wonder if there was more
floors he could of just gone up"
310,"00:23:03,234","00:23:04,867",so he could die instantly.
311,"00:23:05,901","00:23:09,065",Not like...
312,"00:23:09,067","00:23:11,099",Can you die... How many...
313,"00:23:11,101","00:23:13,167","I don't know. I guess
it depends on the building."
314,"00:23:14,700","00:23:16,065","Very, very..."
315,"00:23:16,067","00:23:19,134","Just psychologically,
it's just interesting, but..."
316,"00:23:23,001","00:23:24,865",You don't think.
317,"00:23:24,867","00:23:28,565","He stole from me, from his
employer, from Katherine March."
318,"00:23:28,567","00:23:31,867","My wife... I mean
my former wife is correct."
319,"00:23:33,134","00:23:34,466",I really can paint.
320,"00:23:36,934","00:23:39,498","My copies were so bad
I had to destroy them."
321,"00:23:39,500","00:23:41,001","For God's sake, he's lying."
322,"00:23:43,667","00:23:45,901","Because he's left-handed,
you idiot."
323,"00:23:47,533","00:23:50,099","He told me
Miss March painted them."
324,"00:23:50,101","00:23:51,765",In my expert opinion...
325,"00:24:04,234","00:24:08,165","He said he was going to fix
it when he left my place around 2:00 a.m."
326,"00:24:08,167","00:24:11,232",That's when I told him...
327,"00:24:11,234","00:24:13,698","So he
kills her with my ice pick."
328,"00:24:13,700","00:24:16,531","And I heard her say,
""'Hello, Johnnie' before she hung up."""
329,"00:24:16,533","00:24:18,065",He was there all right.
330,"00:24:18,067","00:24:19,698","Well, what I don't understand"
331,"00:24:19,700","00:24:20,932","is this talk
about her being an artist."
332,"00:24:20,934","00:24:22,531",I never saw her paint.
333,"00:24:22,533","00:24:24,565","That was one
of her peculiar traits."
334,"00:24:24,567","00:24:26,500","She never let anyone
see her paint."
335,"00:24:46,967","00:24:51,198","I would not have guessed, Frank, that you
were a man who enjoyed a foot massage."
336,"00:24:51,200","00:24:56,065","I'm not. When I saw the complimentary
chit in the wedding welcome basket,"
337,"00:24:56,067","00:24:58,099","I thought, ""I don't want that."
338,"00:24:58,101","00:25:00,165","I'm not comfortable with other
people touching my feet."
339,"00:25:00,167","00:25:02,565","I don't see why
it's necessary or good."""
340,"00:25:02,567","00:25:04,598",Then why are you here?
341,"00:25:04,600","00:25:07,032","Because it's a $30 value,
and throwing it away"
342,"00:25:07,034","00:25:09,099","would have bothered me
even more than this does."
343,"00:25:09,101","00:25:10,498","So, you're cheap."
344,"00:25:10,500","00:25:11,965","Oh, I'm way worse
than cheap,"
345,"00:25:11,967","00:25:14,498","especially when it comes to free shit...
I hoard free shit."
346,"00:25:14,500","00:25:16,032","Especially
the gray-area free shit,"
347,"00:25:16,034","00:25:19,165","like the nail files and disposable
slippers in the hotel room."
348,"00:25:19,167","00:25:20,832","""Gray area."""
349,"00:25:20,834","00:25:22,832","I tell myself that they
want me to take it,"
350,"00:25:22,834","00:25:24,531","that I'm intended
to take it."
351,"00:25:24,533","00:25:25,932","Do you take
the shoehorns?"
352,"00:25:25,934","00:25:27,732","Not the long ones,
only the short ones."
353,"00:25:27,734","00:25:31,065","Well, that's not a gray area,
that's theft. You're a thief."
354,"00:25:31,067","00:25:34,531","Do you take the shampoo,
conditioner, and body wash?"
355,"00:25:34,533","00:25:36,865","I used to, but then one
leaked in my suitcase."
356,"00:25:36,867","00:25:39,531",Huh. What about the soaps?
357,"00:25:39,533","00:25:41,132","Not the round soaps
wrapped in paper."
358,"00:25:41,134","00:25:43,865","But the bigger ones,
in the boxes? Yes, I do."
359,"00:25:43,867","00:25:47,832","So, you're a minor person
with grubby hands."
360,"00:25:47,834","00:25:50,765","I don't understand how, even after
Keith did what he did to you,"
361,"00:25:50,767","00:25:53,032","and even in the midst
of the shame of being here,"
362,"00:25:53,034","00:25:55,531","you can possibly still
be mooning over him."
363,"00:25:55,533","00:25:57,032","That's because
you're a monkey"
364,"00:25:57,034","00:25:59,531","who doesn't understand
the human condition."
365,"00:25:59,533","00:26:01,465","Having met you, I understand
why it's a condition."
366,"00:26:01,467","00:26:02,865","You don't stop
loving a person"
367,"00:26:02,867","00:26:05,099","just because
they injure you."
368,"00:26:05,101","00:26:06,531",It helps.
369,"00:26:06,533","00:26:09,164","- Well, love is not rational.
- Clearly."
370,"00:26:09,166","00:26:10,999","But how could you
even like Keith?"
371,"00:26:11,001","00:26:13,732","- I never said I liked him.
- Then how can you love him?"
372,"00:26:13,734","00:26:15,732","Love has nothing
to do with like."
373,"00:26:15,734","00:26:19,065","- Healthy people would disagree.
- Healthy people are sick."
374,"00:26:19,067","00:26:22,531","Isn't there a part of you that just
wants to wish him well and move on?"
375,"00:26:22,533","00:26:26,164","Mmm... Most of me wants him
to be found in an icy river."
376,"00:26:26,166","00:26:29,531","It makes no sense to want the
person you love to be dead."
377,"00:26:29,533","00:26:31,865","Because then you'd have no one
left to love except yourself."
378,"00:26:31,867","00:26:34,133","Which, in your case,
would be unrequited."
379,"00:26:35,667","00:26:39,198","- I really don't want him dead.
- Good."
380,"00:26:39,200","00:26:42,465","I want him to have a long life, during
which he is miserable every single day"
381,"00:26:42,467","00:26:44,932","before slowly
dying of regret."
382,"00:26:44,934","00:26:47,832","There are seven billion people
in the world."
383,"00:26:47,834","00:26:49,932","So when one of them
behaves badly toward you,"
384,"00:26:49,934","00:26:52,865","he's actually doing you a great
favor because he's saving you time."
385,"00:26:52,867","00:26:55,231","He's telling you that
he's not worth your while."
386,"00:26:55,233","00:26:57,698","He's freeing you to say,
""Thank you for the information."
387,"00:26:57,700","00:27:05,164","I will now move on to
the 6,999,999,999 other people,"
388,"00:27:05,166","00:27:07,999","some of whom
may have some value."""
389,"00:27:08,001","00:27:09,732","And is that what
you've done, Frank?"
390,"00:27:09,734","00:27:12,064","Just sifted,
calmly and sensibly,"
391,"00:27:12,066","00:27:15,531","through the entire population,
searching for your soul mate?"
392,"00:27:15,533","00:27:18,665","No, I have opted out, which
makes me uniquely qualified"
393,"00:27:18,667","00:27:20,565","to observe and comment
on your situation."
394,"00:27:20,567","00:27:22,034","Oh, I am so lucky."
395,"00:27:23,600","00:27:25,932","- It was a long time ago.
- Not an eternity."
396,"00:27:25,934","00:27:30,064","- You were both very young.
- Old enough to know right from wrong."
397,"00:27:30,066","00:27:32,465","Incidentally, I spoke
to the bride last night."
398,"00:27:32,467","00:27:35,565","Oh, she does not have the
sense God gave a toaster."
399,"00:27:35,567","00:27:38,832","She's a moron, and her breasts
were built on a medical bench."
400,"00:27:38,834","00:27:42,232","But she said to tell you that
she hopes you can be friends."
401,"00:27:42,234","00:27:43,899",You talked about me?
402,"00:27:43,901","00:27:45,565","She didn't give you
a lot of airtime."
403,"00:27:45,567","00:27:47,698","She has trouble
stringing sentences together."
404,"00:27:47,700","00:27:49,632","And she uses a lot
of personal pronouns,"
405,"00:27:49,634","00:27:51,832","so you're not always quite sure
who she's talking about."
406,"00:27:51,834","00:27:53,698","Well done, Keith."
407,"00:27:53,700","00:27:57,732","But if it helps, she said
she's not threatened by you."
408,"00:27:57,734","00:28:00,698","Yes, that helps
tremendously."
409,"00:28:00,700","00:28:02,380","At least I think
she was talking about you."
410,"00:28:03,767","00:28:07,832","She said ""her."" I'm pretty
sure she meant you."
411,"00:28:07,834","00:28:11,665","- Wow. What do you care anyway?
- I don't."
412,"00:28:11,667","00:28:14,632","I'm just trying to amuse myself
and get to tomorrow."
413,"00:28:14,634","00:28:17,000","Do you care
about anything?"
414,"00:28:18,767","00:28:21,000","How many times in your life
have you been in love?"
415,"00:28:22,166","00:28:23,932",Once.
416,"00:28:23,934","00:28:25,467",What was it like?
417,"00:28:42,834","00:28:45,865","How does anybody drink wine
at 11:00 in the morning?"
418,"00:28:45,867","00:28:47,598","It's a winery, Frank."
419,"00:28:47,600","00:28:50,598","Haven't you ever given out a Car
of the Year award at 11:00?"
420,"00:28:50,600","00:28:52,000",I can still taste toothpaste.
421,"00:28:54,800","00:28:57,732","- You were absolutely right.
- What did you say?"
422,"00:28:57,734","00:29:00,598","A destination wedding
is presumptuous."
423,"00:29:00,600","00:29:02,832","""Please drag your carcass
hundreds of miles"
424,"00:29:02,834","00:29:05,064","to excessively celebrate
our happiness."""
425,"00:29:05,066","00:29:07,632","Yeah. ""Because our
wedding is so special,"
426,"00:29:07,634","00:29:09,899","it needs to be
an epic imposition."""
427,"00:29:09,901","00:29:13,531","""It's far too important to celebrate
in anybody's shit-ass hometown."""
428,"00:29:13,533","00:29:17,531","""Or on one calendar day. So kindly
give up your entire weekend."""
429,"00:29:17,533","00:29:20,565","""And spend a fuck-ton of your own
money, over and above the gift."""
430,"00:29:20,567","00:29:22,665","I bet you loved
the minibar prices."
431,"00:29:22,667","00:29:24,000","It's like 80 cents
per cashew."
432,"00:29:26,134","00:29:27,832","What's hilarious
is that these two"
433,"00:29:27,834","00:29:30,498","have no idea they're
in a fool's paradise."
434,"00:29:30,500","00:29:32,565",You really think that?
435,"00:29:32,567","00:29:35,732","I've spent most of my life dodging the
shrapnel from my mother's marriages,"
436,"00:29:35,734","00:29:39,165","both of which started
with smiles as big as theirs."
437,"00:29:39,167","00:29:41,098",Some marriages work out.
438,"00:29:41,100","00:29:43,598","Yes, and some people
have six fingers."
439,"00:29:43,600","00:29:45,598","So I'm guessing
you're single."
440,"00:29:45,600","00:29:47,732","I decided to learn
from my parents' mistakes."
441,"00:29:47,734","00:29:49,998","It's a form
of evolution."
442,"00:29:50,000","00:29:53,732","Yeah, but you can't blame people for
believing their own lives will be different."
443,"00:29:53,734","00:29:57,498","Yes, I can.
It's incredibly egotistical."
444,"00:29:57,500","00:30:00,964","It might help you to consider the
idea that heartbreak is pointless,"
445,"00:30:00,966","00:30:02,665","because if you had
wound up with the person,"
446,"00:30:02,667","00:30:05,498","eventually, you would've
been miserable anyway."
447,"00:30:05,500","00:30:07,565","Actually that does help,
thank you."
448,"00:30:07,567","00:30:10,132",No problem.
449,"00:30:10,134","00:30:13,031","But don't you believe there's
someone for everyone?"
450,"00:30:13,033","00:30:14,498",Close.
451,"00:30:14,500","00:30:17,000","I believe that there's
nobody for anyone."
452,"00:30:34,167","00:30:37,632","I wish your mother and Howard's
corpse-friend were playing."
453,"00:30:37,634","00:30:41,465","They could try and dislodge
each other's tunnel catheters."
454,"00:30:41,467","00:30:43,465","Have you talked
to the corpse-friend?"
455,"00:30:43,467","00:30:47,165","Briefly. She's dull, and she
needs a week at depilatory camp."
456,"00:30:47,167","00:30:50,498","- Maybe she's rich.
- I sure hope so."
457,"00:30:50,500","00:30:51,600",Get her!
458,"00:30:53,667","00:30:55,632","Do you ever think
it's a crutch though,"
459,"00:30:55,634","00:30:57,898","blaming your mother and
father for everything?"
460,"00:30:57,900","00:30:59,665","When did crutches
get a bad name?"
461,"00:30:59,667","00:31:01,232","When you have a broken leg,
you need a crutch."
462,"00:31:01,234","00:31:03,765","In fact, it would be stupid
not to have a crutch."
463,"00:31:03,767","00:31:06,065","Well, yeah,
but broken legs heal."
464,"00:31:06,067","00:31:08,465","I mean don't you have
a responsibility to yourself"
465,"00:31:08,467","00:31:12,498","to eventually cast aside the
crutches and meet new challenges?"
466,"00:31:12,500","00:31:14,765","If the parent-child bond
is diseased,"
467,"00:31:14,767","00:31:18,931","you have a better chance of being a
sociopath than of being well-adjusted."
468,"00:31:18,933","00:31:20,931","I consider it a triumph
of the will"
469,"00:31:20,933","00:31:24,498","that there aren't shallow graves
dotting my backyard."
470,"00:31:24,500","00:31:27,864","Besides, who are you to talk?"
471,"00:31:27,866","00:31:32,199","Simple heartbreak like yours should be,
relatively speaking, a piece of cake to get over."
472,"00:31:32,201","00:31:34,132","Well, it's not."
473,"00:31:34,134","00:31:37,797","I'd rather be strong and ruined
than weak and ruined."
474,"00:31:37,799","00:31:40,732","I'm not weak.
I just have hope."
475,"00:31:40,734","00:31:42,665",That's the same thing.
476,"00:31:58,700","00:32:02,665","How do you not install steps
or a pathway for this shit?"
477,"00:32:02,667","00:32:04,831","They warned us. It was
in the Welcome Basket."
478,"00:32:04,833","00:32:06,831","This is a fucking
liability nightmare."
479,"00:32:06,833","00:32:09,099","That's right,
sue Keith again."
480,"00:32:09,101","00:32:11,165","Can't we just get the van
to drive us up?"
481,"00:32:11,167","00:32:13,797","- We're going 90 feet.
- Well, the heels won't make it."
482,"00:32:13,799","00:32:15,797","Then take them off
until we get there."
483,"00:32:15,799","00:32:18,165","- I just got a foot massage.
- So?"
484,"00:32:18,167","00:32:21,598","I'm not gonna show up at my
ex-fiancé's wedding with dirty feet."
485,"00:32:21,600","00:32:24,099","You can clean them off
at the grape wash."
486,"00:32:24,101","00:32:26,931","- Can't you just carry me, please?
- What?"
487,"00:32:26,933","00:32:30,065","- I can't believe I have to ask.
- What?"
488,"00:32:30,067","00:32:32,598","- It's 90 feet.
- How much do you weigh?"
489,"00:32:32,600","00:32:34,831","- Frank.
- I don't want to shed my mortal coil."
490,"00:32:34,833","00:32:37,001","Well, if that happens,
you can put me down."
491,"00:32:48,634","00:32:50,831","You have a high,
specific gravity."
492,"00:32:50,833","00:32:52,632","Yeah, dense bones."
493,"00:32:52,634","00:32:54,797",Really deceptive avoirdupois.
494,"00:32:54,799","00:32:57,531","This is the slowest
I've ever been carried."
495,"00:32:57,533","00:32:59,099","Oh, dear God, be quiet."
496,"00:32:59,101","00:33:00,831","Can you just let me off
at the top though,"
497,"00:33:00,833","00:33:02,864","so no one sees
that you carried me?"
498,"00:33:02,866","00:33:06,698","Why? Maybe Keith will get
jealous and rethink everything."
499,"00:33:06,700","00:33:08,831","Keith has
forgotten I'm here."
500,"00:33:14,201","00:33:15,201",Fuck me.
501,"00:33:23,001","00:33:26,165",It's 800 degrees.
502,"00:33:26,167","00:33:28,565","Why is the minister
in a seersucker suit?"
503,"00:33:28,567","00:33:29,764",Because he's not a minister.
504,"00:33:29,766","00:33:31,132","He's Keith's friend
from college."
505,"00:33:31,134","00:33:32,999","Levy, I think his name is."
506,"00:33:33,001","00:33:35,099","- Kaplan?
- Kaplan, right."
507,"00:33:35,101","00:33:37,465","- Is he wearing makeup?
- Always."
508,"00:33:37,467","00:33:39,764","Usually
the Nars Radiant Creamy."
509,"00:33:39,766","00:33:41,632","If memory serves,
he's gay."
510,"00:33:41,634","00:33:45,831","The correct term is ""Effeminate
American."" And actually he's pansexual."
511,"00:33:45,833","00:33:47,232",What does that mean?
512,"00:33:47,234","00:33:49,165","He's attracted
to all genders,"
513,"00:33:49,167","00:33:51,965","gender identities,
and sexual orientations."
514,"00:33:51,967","00:33:53,999","- Come on.
- I'm telling you."
515,"00:33:54,001","00:33:55,797",How'd he get the gig?
516,"00:33:55,799","00:33:57,531","He fucked the bride
and the groom."
517,"00:33:57,533","00:34:00,132","- Which was, like, no big deal.
- Vanilla."
518,"00:34:00,134","00:34:02,664","I mean, because he would fuck, for
example, a man who believes he's a woman?"
519,"00:34:02,666","00:34:04,199",Absolutely.
520,"00:34:04,201","00:34:07,065","Or a straight woman who believes
she's actually a gay man?"
521,"00:34:07,067","00:34:09,165","- Not a day goes by.
- What about hermaphrodites?"
522,"00:34:09,167","00:34:10,731",You'd have to think.
523,"00:34:10,733","00:34:12,932","They just let anyone
officiate at weddings?"
524,"00:34:12,934","00:34:16,697","Not anyone. You need a credit
card and an Internet connection."
525,"00:34:16,699","00:34:20,032","- You researched this?
- Oh, I researched everything."
526,"00:34:20,034","00:34:21,999","I knew where
we would buy a house,"
527,"00:34:22,001","00:34:24,999","where our kids would be born,
where they'd go to school."
528,"00:34:25,001","00:34:26,733",I knew where we'd be buried.
529,"00:34:29,867","00:34:32,899","Do you become a clergyman in
an online church of some sort?"
530,"00:34:32,901","00:34:35,032","No, you can
just do weddings."
531,"00:34:35,034","00:34:37,132","- Not baptisms?
- No."
532,"00:34:37,134","00:34:40,165","- Funerals? Bar Mitzvahs?
- Just weddings."
533,"00:34:40,167","00:34:43,932","- How many believers does he have?
- No believers. No congregation."
534,"00:34:43,934","00:34:47,099","- Does his church preach that there's a heaven?
- Ain't got no church."
535,"00:34:47,101","00:34:50,798","Why would anyone have my
mother as the maid of honor?"
536,"00:34:50,800","00:34:54,697","I don't know. It's like having
the Grim Reaper at your CAT scan."
537,"00:34:54,699","00:34:58,597","If I had a nickel for every time she
said to me, ""I am not your maid."""
538,"00:34:58,599","00:35:02,232","- Was she born during the Great Depression?
- No, she caused it."
539,"00:35:02,234","00:35:04,664","- You know who I feel sorry for?
- Yourself?"
540,"00:35:04,666","00:35:06,165",Anne's father.
541,"00:35:06,167","00:35:08,697","Why? He's the only one here
who wasn't married to my mother."
542,"00:35:08,699","00:35:13,899","Because once upon a time, he was the Most
Important Male Person In Anne's Life,"
543,"00:35:13,901","00:35:16,865","the ""M.P.I.A.L."" if you will."
544,"00:35:16,867","00:35:19,165","I will, but only
if I have to."
545,"00:35:19,167","00:35:22,597","It's dangerous for a father
to pass that mantle."
546,"00:35:22,599","00:35:25,965","Just because he's Danish doesn't mean
he was fucking his own daughter."
547,"00:35:25,967","00:35:29,232","In a very real sense,
by virtue of cultivating"
548,"00:35:29,234","00:35:33,631","a healthy, loving relationship with
her, showing her, day after day,"
549,"00:35:33,633","00:35:36,132","year after year, how a good
man should comport himself,"
550,"00:35:36,134","00:35:38,865","he's been preparing
her whole life for marriage."
551,"00:35:38,867","00:35:41,465","- To Keith.
- Exactly."
552,"00:35:41,467","00:35:43,765","That's the lamb to
the slaughter right there."
553,"00:35:43,767","00:35:47,232","She and her dad have been leading with
their chins, cruising for a bruising."
554,"00:35:47,234","00:35:49,465","Asking for it.
It's a total sucker play."
555,"00:35:49,467","00:35:50,965",Or so you've heard.
556,"00:35:50,967","00:35:53,165","There's a sucker that reaches
age of consent every minute."
557,"00:35:53,167","00:35:56,564","When Keith turns out to be
the mythic jerk that he is,"
558,"00:35:56,566","00:36:00,132","all of her carefully curated
self-esteem will be destroyed,"
559,"00:36:00,134","00:36:03,566","a father will have lost a
daughter, and where will she be?"
560,"00:36:04,633","00:36:06,498","Right here
with the rest of us."
561,"00:36:28,967","00:36:30,666",I used to love this song.
562,"00:36:32,001","00:36:34,132",Do you want to dance?
563,"00:36:34,134","00:36:35,867","- I said ""used to.""
- Fine."
564,"00:36:37,967","00:36:40,564","- Why, do you want to dance?
- Of course not, I hate dancing."
565,"00:36:40,566","00:36:42,965","It's moronic and a
complete waste of time."
566,"00:36:42,967","00:36:45,765",You're not that busy.
567,"00:36:45,767","00:36:49,099","I just thought maybe you wanted to
dance to get your mind off things."
568,"00:36:49,101","00:36:51,232",I don't and it wouldn't.
569,"00:36:51,234","00:36:54,765",Fine. I said fine.
570,"00:36:54,767","00:36:56,734","Neither of us wants
to fucking dance."
571,"00:37:01,134","00:37:04,599","I can't help but hope
Keith tears a hip muscle."
572,"00:37:14,001","00:37:15,867",Can we take a walk?
573,"00:37:42,700","00:37:44,899","- How are the shoes?
- They're fine."
574,"00:37:44,901","00:37:47,165","I didn't really want to go through
the whole entire selection,"
575,"00:37:47,167","00:37:50,698","but I have weird arches
on my mom's side."
576,"00:37:50,700","00:37:52,698","- So they're good.
- Yeah."
577,"00:37:52,700","00:37:54,232",Okay.
578,"00:37:54,234","00:37:56,665","You know after
the whole thing with Keith,"
579,"00:37:56,667","00:38:00,632","- I was diagnosed with PTSD.
- Rich person's PTSD."
580,"00:38:00,634","00:38:03,597","- Privileged person's PTSD.
- Okay, I do know what you're saying."
581,"00:38:03,599","00:38:05,497","This is why people
hate the top one percent."
582,"00:38:05,499","00:38:08,232","- I am not the top one percent.
- Neither am I."
583,"00:38:08,234","00:38:11,598","When people talk about the top
one percent like it's home,"
584,"00:38:11,600","00:38:13,065",it drives me fucking crazy.
585,"00:38:13,067","00:38:14,832","You know who's actually
in the top one percent"
586,"00:38:14,834","00:38:16,732","are the assholes
that run the companies"
587,"00:38:16,734","00:38:18,965","that I prosecute
and you reward."
588,"00:38:18,967","00:38:21,832","Top ten, top 20 percent,
whatever it is."
589,"00:38:21,834","00:38:23,999","The segment of society
that doesn't have to worry"
590,"00:38:24,001","00:38:27,099","about basic things like food,
clothing, shelter, transportation,"
591,"00:38:27,101","00:38:28,832","or getting shot
by the police."
592,"00:38:28,834","00:38:30,497","So we're not allowed
to have problems?"
593,"00:38:30,499","00:38:32,665","We're allowed to have them, but
no one is interested in them."
594,"00:38:32,667","00:38:35,099","And I don't blame them,
I'm not even interested."
595,"00:38:35,101","00:38:38,132","We're trite, trivial,
tiresome, tone-deaf narcissists."
596,"00:38:38,134","00:38:40,798","I never said I wasn't
a tone-deaf narcissist."
597,"00:38:40,800","00:38:42,732","- The optics are very bad.
- Nobody's looking."
598,"00:38:42,734","00:38:44,065","We should keep our shit
to ourselves."
599,"00:38:44,067","00:38:46,199","We are keeping it
to ourselves."
600,"00:38:46,201","00:38:50,464","Besides, it's human nature to find pain in
any situation, however relatively fortunate."
601,"00:38:50,466","00:38:52,598","That doesn't
make it listenable."
602,"00:38:52,600","00:38:56,165","Well, I'm sorry if my brand of pain
is out of vogue, but it's all I got."
603,"00:38:56,167","00:38:58,732","It would be so much more
interesting and fantastic"
604,"00:38:58,734","00:39:00,999","if we had been
fondled by priests"
605,"00:39:01,001","00:39:03,932","or lost a leg but could
still feel it or something."
606,"00:39:05,700","00:39:09,497","My theory about
myself is that my soma"
607,"00:39:09,499","00:39:13,632","is sending me a Darwinian
message telling me,"
608,"00:39:13,634","00:39:16,899","""Hey, you're unfit to pass your
DNA on to future generations,"
609,"00:39:16,901","00:39:18,932","so you should just select out."""
610,"00:39:18,934","00:39:21,698","Well, just keep doing
what you're doing."
611,"00:39:21,700","00:39:24,099","But I have
so much to give."
612,"00:39:24,101","00:39:25,734",Not really.
613,"00:39:27,067","00:39:29,765","Holy shit, Frank.
What is that?"
614,"00:39:29,767","00:39:31,497",I think it's a mountain lion.
615,"00:39:31,499","00:39:34,765","- Could it be a jaguar?
- I don't know. I'm not a zookeeper."
616,"00:39:34,767","00:39:36,798","It's too big for an
ocelot or a bearcat,"
617,"00:39:36,800","00:39:38,798","but too small
for a panther, I think."
618,"00:39:38,800","00:39:41,199","What the fuck difference does it make
what it is? It's a fucking predator cat."
619,"00:39:41,201","00:39:42,765","A cougar, maybe?"
620,"00:39:42,767","00:39:44,865","- Jesus Christ.
- I don't know what you're worried about."
621,"00:39:44,867","00:39:46,565","- It's gonna go for me.
- Why?"
622,"00:39:46,567","00:39:48,798","I saw a thing. They pick out
the smallest of the herd."
623,"00:39:48,800","00:39:50,132","We're not a herd,
we're wedding guests."
624,"00:39:50,134","00:39:52,165","I'm telling you,
you're safe if you just run."
625,"00:39:52,167","00:39:53,632","You run.
I'll stay here and fight."
626,"00:39:53,634","00:39:55,099","Uh, yeah,
but I'm not a sprinter."
627,"00:39:55,101","00:39:57,865","I run for distance, so it
gives me a certain clarity..."
628,"00:39:57,867","00:39:59,498","Yes, all right."
629,"00:39:59,500","00:40:00,832","You run.
I'll stay here and fight."
630,"00:40:00,834","00:40:03,065","How about if we both run
and nobody stays and fights?"
631,"00:40:03,067","00:40:04,765","Neither one of us
can outrun a cheetah."
632,"00:40:04,767","00:40:06,565","It's not a fucking cheetah.
We're not in Africa."
633,"00:40:06,567","00:40:08,732","They're also in Iran,
I think it said."
634,"00:40:08,734","00:40:10,199","They won't even
hear us scream."
635,"00:40:10,201","00:40:11,999","I hate those
fucking people."
636,"00:40:12,001","00:40:14,598","On the plus side,
you'll be ruining Keith's wedding."
637,"00:40:14,600","00:40:17,132","- That's true.
- Unless they don't find us for weeks."
638,"00:40:17,134","00:40:19,965","And then only in pieces, some of
which were brought back to its lair."
639,"00:40:21,600","00:40:23,232",Last chance on the running.
640,"00:40:23,234","00:40:26,199","I can't believe you're the last human
person I'm ever gonna talk to."
641,"00:40:26,201","00:40:27,765",There might be EMTs.
642,"00:40:27,767","00:40:30,565","Yeah, but I might
be a hemophiliac."
643,"00:40:30,567","00:40:32,565","Might be?
Don't you know that already?"
644,"00:40:32,567","00:40:36,531","Well, no, because you can get things
as an adult, like adult onset asthma."
645,"00:40:36,533","00:40:38,834",My friend Suzanne has that...
646,"00:40:54,667","00:40:57,199","- Now we run!
- Oh!"
647,"00:40:57,201","00:40:59,598","- That was good, Frank.
- My throat is really raw."
648,"00:40:59,600","00:41:00,999","But why are
we still running?"
649,"00:41:01,001","00:41:02,365","Because I don't
think it's a bad idea"
650,"00:41:02,367","00:41:05,199","to put as much distance between us
and the mountain lion as possible."
651,"00:41:05,201","00:41:06,698","It might've
been a lynx!"
652,"00:41:06,700","00:41:07,999","It would be so
ironic if I strangled you."
653,"00:41:08,001","00:41:10,231","Why do you have to ruin
a nice moment!"
654,"00:41:10,233","00:41:13,832","- Ow!
- Ah, fuck! Ah, fuck!"
655,"00:41:13,834","00:41:16,899","- Ow! Ow!
- Fuck! Fuck! Fuck, fuck, fuck!"
656,"00:41:16,901","00:41:18,167",Ah!
657,"00:41:20,467","00:41:22,399",Okay. Oh.
658,"00:41:25,233","00:41:27,500","For the record,
you ruined the moment, not me."
659,"00:41:30,901","00:41:32,467",Lindsay?
660,"00:41:33,800","00:41:35,134",Lindsay?
661,"00:41:37,500","00:41:41,465","I'm fine!
For God's sake. Jesus."
662,"00:41:41,467","00:41:44,865","- Great.
- I just had the wind knocked out of me."
663,"00:41:44,867","00:41:46,765","Okay, good."
664,"00:41:46,767","00:41:50,099","It was good, because you didn't have
the first clue what you were doing."
665,"00:41:50,101","00:41:52,932","Hey, it's been a while
since health class."
666,"00:41:52,934","00:41:55,832","Yeah, well, if you thought
I had a cervical injury,"
667,"00:41:55,834","00:41:58,132","the last thing you're supposed
to do is flip a person over"
668,"00:41:58,134","00:42:00,065",like a fuckin' pancake.
669,"00:42:00,067","00:42:04,732","- I'm sorry.
- But on the other hand, you did save me."
670,"00:42:04,734","00:42:05,932",Us.
671,"00:42:05,934","00:42:08,665","I told you,
it would have gone for me."
672,"00:42:08,667","00:42:11,465","Why did you do that?
Why did you save me?"
673,"00:42:11,467","00:42:12,467",I didn't save you.
674,"00:42:13,567","00:42:15,099",Why did you save me?
675,"00:42:15,101","00:42:16,632",Because I'm an idiot.
676,"00:42:16,634","00:42:20,032","- You could've died.
- Of idiocy."
677,"00:42:20,034","00:42:22,001","Don't tell me
you're secretly noble."
678,"00:42:22,967","00:42:24,164",I'm not.
679,"00:42:24,166","00:42:25,531","But I thought,
""Maybe she's right."
680,"00:42:25,533","00:42:26,899","Maybe hers
is the life in danger."
681,"00:42:26,901","00:42:29,598","She seems to know
fuckin' everything."""
682,"00:42:29,600","00:42:33,065","And I didn't want to feel guilty for the
rest of my life about not having saved you."
683,"00:42:33,067","00:42:34,698",I get that.
684,"00:42:34,700","00:42:38,465","- I didn't want to think of myself as selfish.
- Frank."
685,"00:42:38,467","00:42:42,565","As that selfish. Not on top of everything
else I already think about myself."
686,"00:42:42,567","00:42:44,865",Copy you.
687,"00:42:44,867","00:42:47,465","'Cause it's not like
I have so much to live for."
688,"00:42:47,467","00:42:49,634","Yeah, well,
that's true."
689,"00:42:50,967","00:42:52,467","Well, anyway, thank you."
690,"00:42:59,600","00:43:01,198","What the fuck, Frank?"
691,"00:43:01,200","00:43:02,832","I'm sorry.
I don't know what that was."
692,"00:43:02,834","00:43:05,101","Neither do I,
for fuck's sake. Jesus."
693,"00:43:08,967","00:43:11,065","- Goddamn it!
- I'm sorry."
694,"00:43:11,067","00:43:13,634","- What is wrong with you?
- I don't know."
695,"00:43:19,233","00:43:20,832",What the fuck?
696,"00:43:20,834","00:43:22,133","Let's just...
Come on."
697,"00:43:24,867","00:43:25,867",Mmm.
698,"00:43:28,800","00:43:31,001",Can't... Just put it on...
699,"00:43:33,700","00:43:35,665",I'm sorry.
700,"00:43:35,667","00:43:38,999","I'm sorry,
it's just very difficult"
701,"00:43:39,001","00:43:41,899","for me to give myself over to
any sort of positive activity."
702,"00:43:41,901","00:43:45,164","Yeah.
Especially this one."
703,"00:43:45,166","00:43:47,198","It makes me think about how
long I've gone without it,"
704,"00:43:47,200","00:43:49,164","which makes me
want to kill myself."
705,"00:43:49,166","00:43:52,531","Yeah, well, I've been pretty
sure for a very long time"
706,"00:43:52,533","00:43:54,999","that life is essentially
a horrible experience,"
707,"00:43:55,001","00:43:56,965","and I really don't need
this kind of confusion."
708,"00:43:56,967","00:43:58,765","- And pressure.
- Yeah."
709,"00:43:58,767","00:43:59,932","I mean, if it all sucks,
then fuck it,"
710,"00:43:59,934","00:44:02,965","but if it doesn't all suck,
then there's so much pressure."
711,"00:44:02,967","00:44:04,665",Yeah.
712,"00:44:04,667","00:44:07,032","God, do you even know
how long it's been"
713,"00:44:07,034","00:44:10,698","since I've been touched with
affection by another human being?"
714,"00:44:10,700","00:44:12,865",How about without affection?
715,"00:44:12,867","00:44:14,732",Nearly as long.
716,"00:44:14,734","00:44:18,665","I tell you right now, I haven't
felt pleasure since about 2006."
717,"00:44:18,667","00:44:21,064","Sometimes, I feel
the absence of pain,"
718,"00:44:21,066","00:44:23,531","which at this point
feels like pleasure,"
719,"00:44:23,533","00:44:26,001","or at least pleasure's
little cousin."
720,"00:44:26,934","00:44:28,565",I don't have protection.
721,"00:44:28,567","00:44:29,698","Well, why would you?"
722,"00:44:29,700","00:44:32,064","I mean, why would you
have a condom today?"
723,"00:44:32,066","00:44:34,632","What are the odds?
Astronomical."
724,"00:44:34,634","00:44:37,765","- What if you got pregnant?
- I'm sure my womb is hostile."
725,"00:44:37,767","00:44:40,498","Having sex right now
would be irresponsible."
726,"00:44:40,500","00:44:42,164","Well, who cares?"
727,"00:44:42,166","00:44:44,500","I mean, how much worse
can things get?"
728,"00:44:45,967","00:44:47,899","- Okay.
- Yeah?"
729,"00:44:47,901","00:44:49,000",Okay.
730,"00:45:00,934","00:45:02,565",Okay.
731,"00:45:02,567","00:45:05,632",Okay.
732,"00:45:05,634","00:45:07,199",Okay.
733,"00:45:07,201","00:45:09,565",All right.
734,"00:45:10,934","00:45:13,834","Yeah, yeah, yeah..."
735,"00:45:23,100","00:45:24,100",Okay.
736,"00:45:27,634","00:45:28,698",How's that?
737,"00:45:28,700","00:45:30,064",That's fine.
738,"00:45:32,500","00:45:35,498","Do you think the mountain lion
will be attracted to the musk?"
739,"00:45:35,500","00:45:37,465",I think it was a puma.
740,"00:45:38,567","00:45:39,964",How is it now?
741,"00:45:39,966","00:45:43,732","It feels strange
yet pleasantly familiar,"
742,"00:45:43,734","00:45:47,167","kind of like coming off a long
diet or going back to smoking."
743,"00:45:49,100","00:45:50,899",How about now?
744,"00:45:50,901","00:45:52,732","Do you have
any diseases?"
745,"00:45:52,734","00:45:54,064",Of course not.
746,"00:45:54,066","00:45:56,064","I missed every
possible sexual revolution."
747,"00:45:56,066","00:45:58,698","The first one,
the one after Tinder,"
748,"00:45:58,700","00:46:01,232","- the one after Caitlyn Jenner...
- Me, too."
749,"00:46:04,201","00:46:05,832",Crabs.
750,"00:46:05,834","00:46:07,765",You have crabs?
751,"00:46:07,767","00:46:09,098","No, actual crabs."
752,"00:46:09,100","00:46:10,665",Over there.
753,"00:46:10,667","00:46:12,865","Those aren't crabs,
those are tarantulas."
754,"00:46:12,867","00:46:13,964",They look like crabs.
755,"00:46:13,966","00:46:15,064","No, they don't."
756,"00:46:15,066","00:46:17,565","And besides,
they don't attack humans."
757,"00:46:17,567","00:46:18,998","Now you're just
making shit up."
758,"00:46:19,000","00:46:21,531","Oh, yes, for the thrill
of fucking you."
759,"00:46:21,533","00:46:23,798","- Let's get it over with.
- Fine."
760,"00:46:27,900","00:46:31,099","My mother used to tell me to always
use two condoms when you have sex."
761,"00:46:31,101","00:46:32,832","The second one
always had to be bigger."
762,"00:46:32,834","00:46:35,498","- It looked like a wind sock.
- That's so stupid."
763,"00:46:35,500","00:46:38,232","Each condom would cause
the other one to break."
764,"00:46:38,234","00:46:41,232","A fact discovered, astraddle,
in the summer after 12th grade,"
765,"00:46:41,234","00:46:44,832","by a nice girl named Auden
who had no quarrel with anyone."
766,"00:46:44,834","00:46:46,732","She ran screaming
from our rec room."
767,"00:46:46,734","00:46:49,064","Of course, you had sex
in your rec room."
768,"00:46:49,066","00:46:51,099",We had a Nutone intercom system.
769,"00:46:51,101","00:46:53,632","The master control
was in the kitchen."
770,"00:46:53,634","00:46:56,698","My parents could listen and talk to
any room in the house from there."
771,"00:46:56,700","00:46:59,665","I used to call the kitchen
""The Eagle's Nest."""
772,"00:46:59,667","00:47:01,099","When my father heard
Auden wailing,"
773,"00:47:01,101","00:47:03,498","he screamed
through the intercom,"
774,"00:47:03,500","00:47:05,698","""What the fuck
is going on down there?"""
775,"00:47:05,700","00:47:06,732",I said what happened.
776,"00:47:06,734","00:47:08,232","There was a pause,"
777,"00:47:08,234","00:47:10,931","and then my mother said,
""Dinner's ready."""
778,"00:47:10,933","00:47:12,832",Your mother cooked?
779,"00:47:12,834","00:47:14,698","On the off-chance
that we are making a baby,"
780,"00:47:14,700","00:47:15,964","do you want a boy
or a girl?"
781,"00:47:15,966","00:47:17,998",You're asking me this now?
782,"00:47:18,000","00:47:20,099",I'm killing time.
783,"00:47:20,101","00:47:22,598","Uh, a boy."
784,"00:47:22,600","00:47:25,531","My mother actually told
me there's a way to get a boy."
785,"00:47:25,533","00:47:27,598","- Oh, this ought to be good.
- Yeah."
786,"00:47:27,600","00:47:31,832","At the moment of climax, just
shout out, ""Oh, boy! Oh, boy!"""
787,"00:47:31,834","00:47:34,565","Can we please stop
talking about your mother."
788,"00:47:34,567","00:47:36,698","But I don't know why
you'd possibly want a boy,"
789,"00:47:36,700","00:47:38,132","considering, you know,"
790,"00:47:38,134","00:47:40,964","the baseline quality of
your relationships with men."
791,"00:47:40,966","00:47:42,964","Oh. What, revenge?"
792,"00:47:45,234","00:47:47,665","Oh, Jesus, Frank!"
793,"00:47:47,667","00:47:50,598",Jesus effing Christ!
794,"00:47:53,134","00:47:55,798","Oh, God, you look like
you're gonna throw up!"
795,"00:47:55,800","00:47:57,831","Why would I?
You're a very attractive woman."
796,"00:47:57,833","00:47:59,665",Not from that.
797,"00:47:59,667","00:48:00,898","Oh, right,
sorry."
798,"00:48:00,900","00:48:02,199","Oh, God!"
799,"00:48:02,201","00:48:04,598","No!
No, no, no, no!"
800,"00:48:04,600","00:48:06,465","- No?
- No, not ""no."""
801,"00:48:06,467","00:48:07,898","I'm just
a very negative person."
802,"00:48:07,900","00:48:09,032",Okay.
803,"00:48:09,034","00:48:11,032","I'm expressing
incredulity!"
804,"00:48:11,034","00:48:12,831",Got it.
805,"00:48:12,833","00:48:14,232","- No!
- Ah!"
806,"00:48:14,234","00:48:16,831","No! No! No!
No! No!"
807,"00:48:16,833","00:48:18,931","Oh, boy!
Oh, boy!"
808,"00:48:18,933","00:48:20,665","Oh, boy!"
809,"00:48:20,667","00:48:24,632","Yeah!
Oh, boy!"
810,"00:48:30,833","00:48:32,632","Anytime, pal."
811,"00:48:32,634","00:48:33,964",Can you not talk right now?
812,"00:48:33,966","00:48:35,465",Fine.
813,"00:48:35,467","00:48:37,931","- It's gonna get cold out.
- No, it won't."
814,"00:48:37,933","00:48:40,199","Yes, it will.
It's the Paso Robles Diurnal."
815,"00:48:40,201","00:48:42,898","There's
sweeping wind temperatures."
816,"00:48:42,900","00:48:44,831","Don't you know anything
about meteorology?"
817,"00:48:44,833","00:48:46,864",No!
818,"00:48:46,866","00:48:49,132","Oh, God. Kelp."
819,"00:48:49,134","00:48:51,065","- Help?
- No, kelp."
820,"00:48:51,067","00:48:53,665","There's kelp at
or near my vagina."
821,"00:48:53,667","00:48:56,032","Oh, that's grass.
We're in grass."
822,"00:48:56,034","00:48:57,598",How is that better?
823,"00:48:57,600","00:48:59,640","You put the ocean in my head
with the fucking crabs."
824,"00:49:28,567","00:49:29,797",What?
825,"00:49:29,799","00:49:31,467",I had a purse.
826,"00:49:37,201","00:49:39,132",Do you want a drink?
827,"00:49:39,134","00:49:42,165","I want all the drinks poured
directly down my gullet."
828,"00:49:42,167","00:49:45,132","Why don't we go to your room
and crack open your minibar?"
829,"00:49:45,134","00:49:46,632","Why don't we
go to your room"
830,"00:49:46,634","00:49:49,099","and crack open
your goddamn minibar?"
831,"00:49:49,101","00:49:51,697","Frank.
We're alive."
832,"00:49:51,699","00:49:53,600","What does that have
to do with anything?"
833,"00:50:16,667","00:50:18,831","- How do you know the words to this?
- Come on."
834,"00:50:28,833","00:50:32,132",What?
835,"00:50:34,067","00:50:35,697","But at some point,"
836,"00:50:35,699","00:50:38,132","don't you think it just starts
to look a little ridiculous?"
837,"00:50:38,134","00:50:41,531","Think about it, this guy was formally
the head of the committee..."
838,"00:50:41,533","00:50:43,764","""Formerly,"" not ""form-ally."""
839,"00:50:43,766","00:50:45,400","I know, it's appalling."
840,"00:50:46,766","00:50:48,831","Seriously, the chocolate?"
841,"00:50:48,833","00:50:52,032","We're not going to drink without eating.
Alcoholics do that."
842,"00:50:52,034","00:50:53,899","The chocolate
is the most expensive thing"
843,"00:50:53,901","00:50:55,232","in the minibar
besides the..."
844,"00:50:55,234","00:50:57,531",wine.
845,"00:50:57,533","00:50:59,565","Would you rather we had
ordered room service?"
846,"00:50:59,567","00:51:00,865",Definitely not.
847,"00:51:00,867","00:51:02,865",I spoke to the front desk.
848,"00:51:02,867","00:51:05,697","They add a delivery fee,
a 17 percent gratuity,"
849,"00:51:05,699","00:51:08,631","and some sort of fuckin' cover
charge, like we're in Italy."
850,"00:51:08,633","00:51:12,165","I've always wondered why
they give you two glasses"
851,"00:51:12,167","00:51:13,965","even when
you're traveling alone."
852,"00:51:13,967","00:51:16,697","Because one
would be so sad."
853,"00:51:16,699","00:51:18,132","Here's to...
What?"
854,"00:51:18,134","00:51:19,733",Please.
855,"00:51:33,834","00:51:36,132",It's not hashish.
856,"00:51:36,134","00:51:38,764","I'm not wearing anything
under my pajamas."
857,"00:51:38,766","00:51:40,565","Why would you?
They're so alluring."
858,"00:51:40,567","00:51:43,597","I didn't think I was gonna
be intimate this weekend."
859,"00:51:43,599","00:51:44,965",Or any weekend.
860,"00:51:44,967","00:51:47,165","Superman couldn't see
through those pajamas."
861,"00:51:47,167","00:51:48,531",So you tried.
862,"00:51:48,533","00:51:51,132","People have jousted
in lighter clothing."
863,"00:51:51,134","00:51:53,165","- Frank?
- Present."
864,"00:51:53,167","00:51:56,099","When you said before that
I was an attractive woman,"
865,"00:51:56,101","00:51:57,731",what did you mean?
866,"00:51:57,733","00:51:59,465","What do you mean
what did I mean?"
867,"00:51:59,467","00:52:01,498","You're an attractive woman.
You're physically appealing."
868,"00:52:01,500","00:52:02,901",Can you be more specific?
869,"00:52:04,599","00:52:07,899","Your facial features
subscribe to the Golden Ratio."
870,"00:52:07,901","00:52:09,564",What?
871,"00:52:09,566","00:52:12,564","One to the quantity one half
times radical five plus one."
872,"00:52:12,566","00:52:13,932",The Golden Ratio.
873,"00:52:13,934","00:52:15,498",You can tell that?
874,"00:52:15,500","00:52:17,099",It's an estimate.
875,"00:52:17,101","00:52:19,531","And you have
The Folds of Aphrodite."
876,"00:52:19,533","00:52:21,731","What are the Folds
of Aphrodite?"
877,"00:52:21,733","00:52:23,731","That's the name of the
particular, graceful way"
878,"00:52:23,733","00:52:25,099","that the cheeks
of beautiful women"
879,"00:52:25,101","00:52:27,731","arrange themselves
when they smile."
880,"00:52:27,733","00:52:31,132","There's a gentle creasing
that begins at the cheekbone"
881,"00:52:31,134","00:52:34,032","and runs downward,
in a slightly arced diagonal,"
882,"00:52:34,034","00:52:37,232","directing the eye
to the mouth."
883,"00:52:37,234","00:52:39,467",It's aesthetically thrilling.
884,"00:52:41,633","00:52:45,132","Well...
I've never heard the term"
885,"00:52:45,134","00:52:46,965","""Folds of Aphrodite."""
886,"00:52:46,967","00:52:48,732",I coined it.
887,"00:52:48,734","00:52:50,664",Then it's not a real thing.
888,"00:52:50,666","00:52:53,132","Then it and you
are bullshit."
889,"00:52:53,134","00:52:55,865","I googled around and there was
no name for it so I coined it."
890,"00:52:55,867","00:52:58,732","- It's established now.
- Bullshit."
891,"00:52:58,734","00:53:02,232","In my experience, there's at least a 90
percent correlation between beautiful women"
892,"00:53:02,234","00:53:04,932","- and women who have The Folds of Aphrodite.
- Oh..."
893,"00:53:04,934","00:53:07,865","The Folds cut across races
and ethnicities."
894,"00:53:07,867","00:53:09,467",What else about me?
895,"00:53:10,532","00:53:11,798",Well...
896,"00:53:15,934","00:53:17,698","you're slender,"
897,"00:53:17,700","00:53:20,465","but not to the point of a
troubled relationship with food."
898,"00:53:20,467","00:53:22,597","That's actionable profiling,
right there."
899,"00:53:22,599","00:53:24,597",File a grievance.
900,"00:53:24,599","00:53:28,032","And your curves are very
sexy but not vulgar."
901,"00:53:28,034","00:53:30,032","Everything very much
in proportion,"
902,"00:53:30,034","00:53:32,199","firm but not overly,"
903,"00:53:32,201","00:53:35,564","which I've always found
weird and prepossessing."
904,"00:53:35,566","00:53:38,732","Your arms bespeak physical
fitness and athleticism,"
905,"00:53:38,734","00:53:40,530",but nothing sapphic.
906,"00:53:40,532","00:53:43,665",And your ankles quietly aver
907,"00:53:43,667","00:53:46,732","that you will keep your body
well into later age."
908,"00:53:46,734","00:53:49,832","It's despicable
the way men look at women."
909,"00:53:49,834","00:53:54,599","In short, you are beautiful,
graceful, and elegant."
910,"00:53:56,101","00:53:59,665","Also, you don't dress
in an overtly sexy way."
911,"00:53:59,667","00:54:01,832","You seem to understand
that dressing sexy"
912,"00:54:01,834","00:54:04,631","is actually the opposite
of being sexy,"
913,"00:54:04,633","00:54:06,865","that certain information
should have to be earned,"
914,"00:54:06,867","00:54:08,732","rather than given away
for free"
915,"00:54:08,734","00:54:11,631","to anyone and everyone
who passeth by your doorstep."
916,"00:54:11,633","00:54:13,798",If this were 1732.
917,"00:54:13,800","00:54:15,165","I'm giving you
a compliment."
918,"00:54:15,167","00:54:16,665","You're calling me
a prude."
919,"00:54:16,667","00:54:18,798","I'm suggesting that
you've taken the high road."
920,"00:54:18,800","00:54:20,965","Even in this flagrant,
flaunting day and age,"
921,"00:54:20,967","00:54:23,199","you have chosen
to preserve the mystery."
922,"00:54:23,201","00:54:27,901","Yes, the pajamas go too far,
but I applaud the ethos."
923,"00:54:30,001","00:54:32,497","- Would you like to know about you?
- No."
924,"00:54:32,499","00:54:33,734","Yes, you would."
925,"00:54:35,700","00:54:37,632",You're very handsome.
926,"00:54:37,634","00:54:40,632",You have powerful eyes.
927,"00:54:40,634","00:54:43,632","Your hair
will never be a problem."
928,"00:54:43,634","00:54:46,732","The corners
of your mouth touch"
929,"00:54:46,734","00:54:51,132","but do not cross the vertical
lines which bisect your eyes."
930,"00:54:51,134","00:54:54,497","In profile, your chin extends
exactly the same as your lower lip,"
931,"00:54:54,499","00:54:56,464",which is an ideal.
932,"00:54:56,466","00:55:01,497","Bodily, you feel strong and
substantial, sinuous but not wiry."
933,"00:55:01,499","00:55:03,232","Sartorially,
you get high marks."
934,"00:55:03,234","00:55:04,965","You tuck in your shirts
because you realize"
935,"00:55:04,967","00:55:07,999","that tails out is
a ridiculous way to dress."
936,"00:55:08,001","00:55:10,899","You wear your pants low, and
your shoes are legitimate."
937,"00:55:10,901","00:55:14,965","And you have
a beautiful penis."
938,"00:55:14,967","00:55:16,665",I do?
939,"00:55:16,667","00:55:18,132","Oh, come on, Frank."
940,"00:55:18,134","00:55:21,001","Surely people have told you
that your entire life."
941,"00:55:22,167","00:55:23,565",No.
942,"00:55:23,567","00:55:25,899","Well, it's very nice."
943,"00:55:25,901","00:55:27,565","It's straight,"
944,"00:55:27,567","00:55:30,099","and you would not believe how
epidemic a problem that is."
945,"00:55:30,101","00:55:33,899","Also,
it's balletically formed."
946,"00:55:33,901","00:55:39,199","It's not so big as to ever
be a cause for concern,"
947,"00:55:39,201","00:55:42,899","but it's big enough never to be
the object of ridicule or scorn."
948,"00:55:42,901","00:55:45,899","You're in
a very sweet spot there."
949,"00:55:45,901","00:55:48,732","Are you saying that Keith's
penis is not straight?"
950,"00:55:48,734","00:55:52,530","Can you imagine that we would
have gone this entire weekend"
951,"00:55:52,532","00:55:54,932","without saying these
things to each other?"
952,"00:55:54,934","00:55:57,598","- ""Balletically formed""?
- That's right."
953,"00:55:57,600","00:56:01,099","People are
ridiculous and pathetic."
954,"00:56:01,101","00:56:04,165","Animals, that's all."
955,"00:56:04,167","00:56:07,999","We want to believe that there's some
high-minded, cosmic meaning behind love,"
956,"00:56:08,001","00:56:09,698","but the truth is
we're drawn to,"
957,"00:56:09,700","00:56:11,632","and make most of our
decisions based upon,"
958,"00:56:11,634","00:56:15,865","shapes we find appealing,
and colors and textures"
959,"00:56:15,867","00:56:19,531","and smells and tastes
and spatial relations."
960,"00:56:19,533","00:56:21,932",It's so stupid.
961,"00:56:21,934","00:56:24,132",This is pretty good.
962,"00:56:24,134","00:56:26,199","I mean, when I think about
what people look like"
963,"00:56:26,201","00:56:29,832","when they kiss or have sex,
I want to vomit."
964,"00:56:29,834","00:56:31,732",You almost did vomit.
965,"00:56:31,734","00:56:35,498","I mean, there's nothing beautiful
or transcendent about being human."
966,"00:56:35,500","00:56:37,999","Ultimately,
it's just a filthy business"
967,"00:56:38,001","00:56:41,698","of a revolting species
trying to survive."
968,"00:56:41,700","00:56:44,531","I mean, if you've ever really
watched another person eat,"
969,"00:56:44,533","00:56:46,665","or seen yourself in a mirror
taking a shit,"
970,"00:56:46,667","00:56:49,531","or walked through
South Coast Plaza,"
971,"00:56:49,533","00:56:51,531","you know exactly
what I'm talking about."
972,"00:56:51,533","00:56:54,165","But I had my eyes open
when I was fucking you,"
973,"00:56:54,167","00:56:56,065","and I thought we must
have looked pretty good."
974,"00:56:56,067","00:56:58,999","My father thought
he had a good golf swing."
975,"00:57:00,201","00:57:01,500",Wait.
976,"00:57:04,234","00:57:06,932",Do a groove chew.
977,"00:57:06,934","00:57:08,765",I'm sorry?
978,"00:57:08,767","00:57:10,765","It's a style
of chewing used"
979,"00:57:10,767","00:57:12,565","when you're really
enjoying something"
980,"00:57:12,567","00:57:14,632","that you don't have
very often."
981,"00:57:14,634","00:57:16,134",Like this.
982,"00:57:18,634","00:57:19,634",Mm!
983,"00:57:21,067","00:57:22,067",Mm!
984,"00:57:24,901","00:57:27,132","- This is a thing?
- I coined it."
985,"00:57:27,134","00:57:29,498",And you're not embarrassed?
986,"00:57:29,500","00:57:31,134","All right, just come on.
Just try."
987,"00:57:34,634","00:57:35,965","- Mmm...
- Mm."
988,"00:57:35,967","00:57:38,467","- Mmm!
- Mmm-mm!"
989,"00:57:45,167","00:57:47,632","- Can you groove swallow?
- You can."
990,"00:57:47,634","00:57:49,734","- Can we groove swallow now?
- Okay, fine."
991,"00:58:06,201","00:58:07,901","- Huh?
- Uh..."
992,"00:58:14,134","00:58:16,467","I remember the
first time I ever saw you."
993,"00:58:17,634","00:58:19,165",It was a partial nephrectomy.
994,"00:58:19,167","00:58:22,567","You were standing in for Dr.
Sumner who had an emergency."
995,"00:58:24,067","00:58:25,798","With your cap and mask,"
996,"00:58:25,800","00:58:27,867","all I could see
were your eyes."
997,"00:58:29,500","00:58:31,001",And I remember thinking...
998,"00:58:31,967","00:58:33,467",thank God.
999,"00:58:35,800","00:58:38,531","Because anything more
would be too much to bear."
1000,"00:58:38,533","00:58:40,465","Stop worrying
about fucking each other"
1001,"00:58:40,467","00:58:43,032","and start saving the people
who are dying in your hospital."
1002,"00:58:43,034","00:58:46,032","Your patient has a
snake in his urethra."
1003,"00:58:46,034","00:58:48,065","You should all
lose your licenses."
1004,"00:58:48,067","00:58:51,498","When my time comes,
I will sign a DNR."
1005,"00:58:51,500","00:58:53,965","I won't.
I want to be resuscitated."
1006,"00:58:53,967","00:58:57,065","I want to be intubated, revived,
retrieved, and prolonged."
1007,"00:58:57,067","00:58:58,531","I want them
to zap me with clappers"
1008,"00:58:58,533","00:59:02,099","and inject my heart with that long needle
of adrenaline... whatever it takes."
1009,"00:59:02,101","00:59:04,132","What? But, what if
there's no hope?"
1010,"00:59:04,134","00:59:05,598",There's already no hope.
1011,"00:59:05,600","00:59:08,164","But what if you're just
a burden to your family"
1012,"00:59:08,166","00:59:10,832","and, by extension, the
entire health-care system?"
1013,"00:59:10,834","00:59:12,032",Won't give a shit.
1014,"00:59:12,034","00:59:13,999","I want them
to stave off death."
1015,"00:59:14,001","00:59:16,665","I don't care if there's turnips
with better brain-wave patterns."
1016,"00:59:16,667","00:59:17,899",Legumes.
1017,"00:59:17,901","00:59:19,765","But I thought
you hated life."
1018,"00:59:19,767","00:59:21,965","I do, but I'm going to
be dead for a long time,"
1019,"00:59:21,967","00:59:23,899",so there's no rush.
1020,"00:59:23,901","00:59:25,198","Do you want
to have children?"
1021,"00:59:25,200","00:59:26,732","I'd rather be dead
in a ditch."
1022,"00:59:26,734","00:59:28,698",Oh.
1023,"00:59:28,700","00:59:31,065","I mean, why would I do
that to those poor souls?"
1024,"00:59:31,067","00:59:33,698","Well, for the same reason
you want to be resuscitated."
1025,"00:59:33,700","00:59:37,565","Because being, as bad as it
is, is better than not being."
1026,"00:59:37,567","00:59:39,698","This is a horrible place
to be."
1027,"00:59:39,700","00:59:41,965","Central California,
or the whole thing?"
1028,"00:59:41,967","00:59:44,632","I'm already alive.
I already know shit."
1029,"00:59:44,634","00:59:46,598","But unborn children
are none the wiser"
1030,"00:59:46,600","00:59:48,531","and deserve to be protected
from certain things,"
1031,"00:59:48,533","00:59:49,999","like being alive
in the first place."
1032,"00:59:50,001","00:59:51,765",That makes no sense.
1033,"00:59:51,767","00:59:53,932","Living was not my choice.
It was my mother's."
1034,"00:59:53,934","00:59:55,965","Have you ever heard
of anything more selfish?"
1035,"00:59:55,967","00:59:58,665","- I hope I'm not pregnant.
- That's all I'm saying."
1036,"00:59:58,667","01:00:00,765","Why did your father
leave your mother?"
1037,"01:00:00,767","01:00:01,932",Because he could.
1038,"01:00:01,934","01:00:04,065","Because he had the power
of locomotion."
1039,"01:00:04,067","01:00:07,932","Why did she keep and hyphenate
both her divorced last names?"
1040,"01:00:07,934","01:00:10,531","Because she thought
it made her sound aristocratic."
1041,"01:00:10,533","01:00:12,131","Also, this way
she gets all her mail."
1042,"01:00:12,133","01:00:16,098","And what would you say
is the major barrier"
1043,"01:00:16,100","01:00:18,698","to a warm relationship between
you and your half-brother?"
1044,"01:00:18,700","01:00:21,465","He's a douchebag. Why are you
asking me these questions?"
1045,"01:00:21,467","01:00:23,598",Just... I don't know.
1046,"01:00:23,600","01:00:27,632","I'm just evaluating your qualifications
as an ongoing love interest."
1047,"01:00:27,634","01:00:29,498","Not that
I'm advocating that."
1048,"01:00:29,500","01:00:32,098","Clearly, you're an emotional
cripple, as am I."
1049,"01:00:32,100","01:00:36,865","I don't have any qualifications as an
ongoing love interest and neither do you."
1050,"01:00:36,867","01:00:38,965","But love interest
is too strong a word."
1051,"01:00:38,967","01:00:40,899","I, um... Affection."
1052,"01:00:40,901","01:00:42,531","Interest.
Tolerance interest."
1053,"01:00:42,533","01:00:44,531","This isn't
going to be ongoing."
1054,"01:00:44,533","01:00:46,698","What, you've just decided
that unilaterally?"
1055,"01:00:46,700","01:00:49,098","- For both our sakes.
- I don't get a say?"
1056,"01:00:49,100","01:00:51,765","No, you have terrible judgment
in this regard."
1057,"01:00:51,767","01:00:54,832","What, but... I..."
1058,"01:00:54,834","01:00:58,565","My head is finally
clear, thanks to you."
1059,"01:00:58,567","01:01:01,164","I mean, I haven't thought about
Keith since the mountain lion."
1060,"01:01:01,166","01:01:03,798","So you admit
it was a mountain lion."
1061,"01:01:03,800","01:01:06,665","Do you have any idea
how huge this is for me?"
1062,"01:01:06,667","01:01:08,565","If it's true,
the mountain lion and I"
1063,"01:01:08,567","01:01:10,965","are happy to have
performed that service."
1064,"01:01:10,967","01:01:14,565","But now, apparently, no
good deed goes unpunished."
1065,"01:01:14,567","01:01:16,698","I think
I finally have closure."
1066,"01:01:16,700","01:01:18,932","I don't trust that statement
and neither should you."
1067,"01:01:18,934","01:01:20,565",But you want to.
1068,"01:01:20,567","01:01:22,798","You don't just jump from one
love object to another."
1069,"01:01:22,800","01:01:24,698","- Tolerance object.
- That's how mistakes are made."
1070,"01:01:24,700","01:01:26,465",All I make are mistakes.
1071,"01:01:26,467","01:01:27,932","At least this one
would be fun."
1072,"01:01:27,934","01:01:29,598","Are you having fun
right now?"
1073,"01:01:29,600","01:01:32,901","Yes. I mean, we're kind of
arguing, but there's hope."
1074,"01:01:34,000","01:01:35,832",This is an interlude.
1075,"01:01:35,834","01:01:37,531",A weekend.
1076,"01:01:37,533","01:01:40,098","A small oasis of time
in which we can taste intimacy"
1077,"01:01:40,100","01:01:43,498","like it's a piece of free
salami at Trader Joe's."
1078,"01:01:43,500","01:01:46,665","Why not? You're in the store anyway,
and you forgot to eat breakfast,"
1079,"01:01:46,667","01:01:50,031","and it tastes okay, and afterwards
there's no salami fallout."
1080,"01:01:50,033","01:01:53,531","When no one's looking, you just
drop the toothpick onto the floor."
1081,"01:01:53,533","01:01:56,232","Man, you're not one of the...
Do you do that?"
1082,"01:01:56,234","01:01:58,098","Well, there's no garbage
pails in that place,"
1083,"01:01:58,100","01:02:01,199","and it's unsanitary to put the
toothpick on the receptacle napkin."
1084,"01:02:01,201","01:02:03,064","All right,
le... just... Okay."
1085,"01:02:03,066","01:02:04,632","Just... I'm just
devil's advocate."
1086,"01:02:04,634","01:02:06,732",Maybe...
1087,"01:02:06,734","01:02:08,465","just what if, okay?"
1088,"01:02:08,467","01:02:10,064",What if it's more?
1089,"01:02:10,066","01:02:13,031","What if there actually
is something to the idea"
1090,"01:02:13,033","01:02:14,899",of a destination wedding?
1091,"01:02:14,901","01:02:18,531","What if we've been thinking about
this whole thing backwards?"
1092,"01:02:18,533","01:02:20,698",What if...
1093,"01:02:20,700","01:02:25,498","I know, but what if our real
destination was each other?"
1094,"01:02:25,500","01:02:27,667","What if you
never say that again?"
1095,"01:02:29,667","01:02:32,665","What if happiness
is... contagious?"
1096,"01:02:32,667","01:02:34,098","Why would you think
that meeting someone"
1097,"01:02:34,100","01:02:35,931","has anything to do
with being happy?"
1098,"01:02:35,933","01:02:37,465",Because!
1099,"01:02:37,467","01:02:39,064","Once upon a time,
I met someone,"
1100,"01:02:39,066","01:02:41,232","and I was happy...
I thought."
1101,"01:02:41,234","01:02:43,565","Personally, I'd be worried
if my life philosophy"
1102,"01:02:43,567","01:02:45,199","began with
""Once Upon a Time."""
1103,"01:02:45,201","01:02:47,199","Well, I was raised
by optimists."
1104,"01:02:47,201","01:02:49,232","But you have a preponderance
of counter-evidence."
1105,"01:02:49,234","01:02:51,064","Were you not watching
your own engagement?"
1106,"01:02:51,066","01:02:53,165","- How could I have been?
- What's wrong with you?"
1107,"01:02:53,167","01:02:55,832","Nothing. Sometimes I just
willfully reject irony."
1108,"01:02:55,834","01:02:57,199",You are doomed.
1109,"01:02:57,201","01:02:59,832","Maybe we saved
each other, Frank."
1110,"01:02:59,834","01:03:02,031","I mean, did you ever
think about it like that?"
1111,"01:03:02,033","01:03:04,698",No. Neither should you.
1112,"01:03:04,700","01:03:07,531","I wonder how many
people met at weddings"
1113,"01:03:07,533","01:03:09,931","- and then went on to...
- Thirty-two."
1114,"01:03:09,933","01:03:12,832","Why not, you know,
extend the oasis?"
1115,"01:03:12,834","01:03:15,165","A good day here,
a good day there,"
1116,"01:03:15,167","01:03:18,498","pretty soon you're just talking
about a couple of good days."
1117,"01:03:18,500","01:03:20,498","What time does our flight
land tomorrow night?"
1118,"01:03:20,500","01:03:22,099","I don't know,
about 7:30?"
1119,"01:03:22,101","01:03:25,465","I will extend it until
tomorrow at about 7:30."
1120,"01:03:25,467","01:03:28,898","Well, there's no point in
extending it another four seconds"
1121,"01:03:28,900","01:03:31,798","if you're not gonna keep your
mind open to the possibilities."
1122,"01:03:31,800","01:03:33,931","Why do people need the
dangled carrot of a future?"
1123,"01:03:33,933","01:03:35,132",Because we do.
1124,"01:03:35,134","01:03:37,099","Because connection
is precious,"
1125,"01:03:37,101","01:03:39,698","therefore, it is immoral"
1126,"01:03:39,700","01:03:42,565","to just treat each other
like dalliances,"
1127,"01:03:42,567","01:03:44,898","even if that's what
we wind up being."
1128,"01:03:44,900","01:03:46,864","But that's exactly what
we wind up being."
1129,"01:03:46,866","01:03:49,498","Permanence is a myth,
an a... an illusion."
1130,"01:03:49,500","01:03:51,598","Well, I didn't say anything
about permanence."
1131,"01:03:51,600","01:03:55,465","I was speaking of a slightly
lengthier temporariness."
1132,"01:03:55,467","01:03:56,632",What's the point?
1133,"01:03:56,634","01:03:58,598","I just told you
what the point was."
1134,"01:03:58,600","01:04:01,698","But when it's over, you're
right back at square zero."
1135,"01:04:01,700","01:04:03,732","I will not
keep my mind open."
1136,"01:04:03,734","01:04:05,698","Well, then
just keep it open"
1137,"01:04:05,700","01:04:08,065","to the possibility
of keeping it open."
1138,"01:04:08,067","01:04:09,067",No.
1139,"01:04:10,533","01:04:11,998",Really?
1140,"01:04:12,000","01:04:16,665","Oh, wow. That's... I...
I'm almost, I'm almost..."
1141,"01:04:16,667","01:04:18,632","You know what,
if you can't or won't,"
1142,"01:04:18,634","01:04:20,964","then you simply
can't or won't."
1143,"01:04:20,966","01:04:22,931","- That's my blanket.
- ""That's my blanket."""
1144,"01:04:22,933","01:04:24,798","You might want to shake out
the Pringle fragments."
1145,"01:04:24,800","01:04:26,498","""You might want to shake out
the Pringle fragments."""
1146,"01:04:26,500","01:04:27,698","If you want to leave,
just say so."
1147,"01:04:27,700","01:04:29,798","- I very much want to leave.
- Say it again."
1148,"01:04:29,800","01:04:31,732",You debate like a child.
1149,"01:04:31,734","01:04:33,732",You eat like a raccoon.
1150,"01:04:33,734","01:04:35,134",You're fucking up.
1151,"01:04:40,067","01:04:41,831","How about
if I keep my mind open"
1152,"01:04:41,833","01:04:43,864","to the possibility
of keeping my mind open"
1153,"01:04:43,866","01:04:46,567","to the possibility
of keeping my mind open?"
1154,"01:04:47,833","01:04:51,065","That is just one metalevel
too removed."
1155,"01:04:51,067","01:04:52,999",Come on.
1156,"01:04:53,001","01:04:54,467",Get back into bed.
1157,"01:04:55,966","01:04:58,500","Let's find out who the
nephrologist is sleeping with."
1158,"01:05:00,001","01:05:01,931",Fine.
1159,"01:05:01,933","01:05:04,465","But only until
the next commercial break."
1160,"01:05:04,467","01:05:06,999",And with no sexual reprise.
1161,"01:05:07,001","01:05:11,999","And only because I do want to know who
the nephrologist is sleeping with."
1162,"01:05:12,001","01:05:13,531",Okay.
1163,"01:05:16,900","01:05:21,099","When I look at
you, I don't see smallpox."
1164,"01:05:21,101","01:05:22,498","And it's ""re-prize."""
1165,"01:05:22,500","01:05:23,665","It's ""re-preeze."""
1166,"01:05:23,667","01:05:26,467","- ""Re-prize.""
- It's... ""re-preeze."""

is it Kristallnacht?"
1168,"01:06:58,034","01:06:59,598","Oh, it's housekeeping."
1169,"01:06:59,600","01:07:01,598","They're not going to
get that reference."
1170,"01:07:02,733","01:07:04,632",Mas retardos!
1171,"01:07:04,634","01:07:08,666",Ah...
1172,"01:07:09,901","01:07:14,099",Oh... You shouldn't be in here.
1173,"01:07:14,101","01:07:15,731",This is my room.
1174,"01:07:15,733","01:07:17,165","Then I shouldn't be
in here."
1175,"01:07:17,167","01:07:19,797",Okay.
1176,"01:07:19,799","01:07:21,865","How did I wind up
in this position?"
1177,"01:07:21,867","01:07:23,664","You made some
poor life choices."
1178,"01:07:23,666","01:07:26,465","No, in this position.
I'm half off the bed."
1179,"01:07:26,467","01:07:28,865",Why is my nose bleeding?
1180,"01:07:28,867","01:07:31,697",I think I have a spinal injury.
1181,"01:07:31,699","01:07:33,598",You feel pregnant?
1182,"01:07:33,600","01:07:34,865",I wouldn't know.
1183,"01:07:34,867","01:07:36,598",What's your gut say?
1184,"01:07:36,600","01:07:38,032",What it always says.
1185,"01:07:38,034","01:07:39,965","""Don't listen to me."""
1186,"01:07:39,967","01:07:41,999",But if you did listen?
1187,"01:07:42,001","01:07:44,598","I don't feel any different,
if that's what you mean."
1188,"01:07:44,600","01:07:47,465","- Good.
- How is that good?"
1189,"01:07:47,467","01:07:51,165","Why would you want me to perpetuate
my general circumstances?"
1190,"01:07:51,167","01:07:53,199","You can do anything you want
with your circumstances."
1191,"01:07:53,201","01:07:55,032","I was thinking
of my circumstances."
1192,"01:07:55,034","01:07:56,932",Which are so wonderful.
1193,"01:07:56,934","01:07:58,697","We shouldn't have spent
the night together."
1194,"01:07:58,699","01:07:59,999",You wouldn't let me leave.
1195,"01:08:00,001","01:08:01,999","I didn't want it to end
on a bad note."
1196,"01:08:02,001","01:08:03,232","Also,
you're in the next room."
1197,"01:08:03,234","01:08:05,132","It would have been
spectacularly awkward."
1198,"01:08:05,134","01:08:06,600",As opposed to this.
1199,"01:08:07,867","01:08:11,132","We tried, okay?
We did."
1200,"01:08:11,134","01:08:14,697","But at some point there's just not
enough optimism left inside a person"
1201,"01:08:14,699","01:08:17,565","to sustain something
like this, you know?"
1202,"01:08:17,567","01:08:20,032","You broken preacher,
me broken choir."
1203,"01:08:20,034","01:08:22,697","I think it's important we recognize
that and verbalize it openly,"
1204,"01:08:22,699","01:08:24,731","so as to avoid
any discomfort."
1205,"01:08:24,733","01:08:27,565",Oh. Mission accomplished.
1206,"01:08:27,567","01:08:28,834",Good.
1207,"01:08:33,967","01:08:36,498",Do you have everything?
1208,"01:08:36,500","01:08:39,132","Oh, um... Yeah."
1209,"01:08:39,134","01:08:42,099","I think, uh, my..."
1210,"01:08:42,101","01:08:44,731","Can we still hang together
at the farewell brunch?"
1211,"01:08:44,733","01:08:46,531","Uh, who else
am I gonna hang with?"
1212,"01:08:46,533","01:08:48,664","Although I suppose
I could hang with myself."
1213,"01:08:48,666","01:08:53,065","Well, I'm going to shove some tissues
up my nostrils and take a shower."
1214,"01:08:53,067","01:08:55,101","Sounds like
good-bye to me."
1215,"01:09:11,201","01:09:14,099","Well, what do you think, about
time we head to the airport?"
1216,"01:09:14,101","01:09:15,564",It's really close.
1217,"01:09:15,566","01:09:16,932",Fifteen minutes.
1218,"01:09:16,934","01:09:19,899","- Well, our flight's not for...
- Five hours."
1219,"01:09:19,901","01:09:22,099","- There could be traffic.
- Why take chances?"
1220,"01:09:22,101","01:09:23,934","Then we should just
say our good-byes."
1221,"01:09:25,734","01:09:26,867",Good-bye.
1222,"01:09:30,901","01:09:32,564",Want your farewell gift?
1223,"01:09:32,566","01:09:35,167","The farewell is my gift,
but please, take mine."
1224,"01:09:52,134","01:09:54,664","Who was San Luis Obispo,
anyway?"
1225,"01:09:54,666","01:09:57,065","And what the fuck did he do
to become a saint?"
1226,"01:09:57,067","01:09:59,865","Thirteenth Century Bishop
of Toulouse."
1227,"01:09:59,867","01:10:03,597","Served the poor, left the
Church, and died of typhus."
1228,"01:10:03,599","01:10:05,199",That's all it takes?
1229,"01:10:05,201","01:10:06,832","It was in
the welcome basket."
1230,"01:10:06,834","01:10:09,564","Why would you canonize a guy
who left the Church?"
1231,"01:10:09,566","01:10:12,798","Why look to France when you're
naming a city in California?"
1232,"01:10:12,800","01:10:14,965","And what the fuck happened
with the urban planning here?"
1233,"01:10:14,967","01:10:17,798","- At some point, did they just give up?
- Right."
1234,"01:10:17,800","01:10:20,631","On the off, off chance
that I ever have a wedding,"
1235,"01:10:20,633","01:10:24,065","I would never make
anyone travel to it."
1236,"01:10:24,067","01:10:26,134","I don't think you'll have
to worry about that."
1237,"01:10:32,633","01:10:34,134","Because you're
a decent person."
1238,"01:10:36,001","01:10:38,132","Not because
you won't get married."
1239,"01:10:38,134","01:10:39,499","Oh, come on."
1240,"01:10:52,599","01:10:54,599","Why do we live, Frank?"
1241,"01:10:55,234","01:10:57,464","Oh, Jesus Christ."
1242,"01:10:57,466","01:10:59,698",I'm serious.
1243,"01:10:59,700","01:11:02,564","The work we do isn't
meaningful in any great sense."
1244,"01:11:02,566","01:11:05,530","The connections we make
invariably fall to ruin."
1245,"01:11:05,532","01:11:08,165","Everything we build
burns to the ground."
1246,"01:11:08,167","01:11:11,698","Meaning is a myth, like you've
said, so why do we live?"
1247,"01:11:11,700","01:11:14,632","I was so enjoying
the silence."
1248,"01:11:14,634","01:11:18,999","It has to be that the myth
isn't a myth for everyone."
1249,"01:11:19,001","01:11:22,065","Well, it's certainly a myth
for those two. Look at them."
1250,"01:11:22,067","01:11:24,899","They'd rather burst into flames
than to fuck each other."
1251,"01:11:24,901","01:11:27,865","- You don't know that.
- Oh, yes, I do."
1252,"01:11:27,867","01:11:33,564","It's possible that within the
myth, there's a sliver of truth,"
1253,"01:11:33,566","01:11:36,232","and you have to believe
in that sliver wholeheartedly,"
1254,"01:11:36,234","01:11:39,564","come what may,
despite the rational mind,"
1255,"01:11:39,566","01:11:43,099","because if you...
if you don't,"
1256,"01:11:43,101","01:11:45,899","the myth just reveals
itself to be a myth,"
1257,"01:11:45,901","01:11:49,632","and meaninglessness becomes
a self-fulfilling prophecy."
1258,"01:11:49,634","01:11:54,698","Try as I might, I cannot get
behind wine in screw-top bottles."
1259,"01:11:54,700","01:11:58,530","Also, you have to encourage
others to believe in the myth."
1260,"01:11:58,532","01:12:00,732","Because if they believe,
they can do anything."
1261,"01:12:00,734","01:12:03,832","They can laugh,
cry, hope,"
1262,"01:12:03,834","01:12:06,032","vote, get married."
1263,"01:12:06,034","01:12:08,999","But if they don't, they can't
do anything, I mean not really,"
1264,"01:12:09,001","01:12:13,632","except make themselves as shallowly
happy and comfortable as possible."
1265,"01:12:13,634","01:12:16,865","Which is just vanity,
let's face it."
1266,"01:12:16,867","01:12:19,865","For me,
wine in a screw-top"
1267,"01:12:19,867","01:12:22,767","will always carry the
stench of chintziness."
1268,"01:12:24,767","01:12:28,099","What if we're
falling in love?"
1269,"01:12:28,101","01:12:30,932","Don't get me wrong,
I'm not a big fan of cork."
1270,"01:12:30,934","01:12:33,232","You ever see it on a wall or
in the heels of an espadrille?"
1271,"01:12:33,234","01:12:34,732",Ridiculous.
1272,"01:12:34,734","01:12:38,765","But for wine, it conveys
a certain necessary élan."
1273,"01:12:38,767","01:12:40,865","What if love
comes for everyone?"
1274,"01:12:40,867","01:12:42,932",Don't be absurd.
1275,"01:12:42,934","01:12:46,531","What if no one is immune,
not even us?"
1276,"01:12:46,533","01:12:47,600",Stop it.
1277,"01:12:49,834","01:12:52,765","It would be remiss
not to embrace the miracle."
1278,"01:12:52,767","01:12:55,032","What happened between us
was not a miracle."
1279,"01:12:55,034","01:12:57,065","It was actually much closer
to a debacle."
1280,"01:12:57,067","01:12:59,132","- Maybe that's what you meant.
- Oh, come on."
1281,"01:12:59,134","01:13:00,865",You don't find it miraculous
1282,"01:13:00,867","01:13:03,765","that two people like us
forged any kind of bond?"
1283,"01:13:03,767","01:13:06,565","I find it ""debaculous."""
1284,"01:13:06,567","01:13:08,232",It was a miracle.
1285,"01:13:08,234","01:13:10,999","It required forever
being seated together."
1286,"01:13:11,001","01:13:14,565","It required an adjoining door
and a near-death experience."
1287,"01:13:14,567","01:13:16,199","What are you waiting for,
a burning bush?"
1288,"01:13:16,201","01:13:18,932","I can't believe you're
bringing this up again."
1289,"01:13:18,934","01:13:20,698","I thought we had
an understanding."
1290,"01:13:20,700","01:13:22,999","We had come
to an agreement."
1291,"01:13:23,001","01:13:25,732","We're less than an hour away
from parting as friends."
1292,"01:13:25,734","01:13:27,498","Okay, but deep down,"
1293,"01:13:27,500","01:13:30,464","in your broken,
miserable gut,"
1294,"01:13:30,466","01:13:33,665","don't you want something
that's pure"
1295,"01:13:33,667","01:13:36,132","and in its own grotesque
way, beautiful?"
1296,"01:13:36,134","01:13:38,099",No.
1297,"01:13:38,101","01:13:41,832","Don't you want to secretly
have a romantic life"
1298,"01:13:41,834","01:13:45,065","that confirms your hopes
instead of your cynicism?"
1299,"01:13:45,067","01:13:46,598",No.
1300,"01:13:46,600","01:13:48,598","Don't you want to believe
that things like this"
1301,"01:13:48,600","01:13:49,965",actually do happen?
1302,"01:13:49,967","01:13:51,932","Nope. I'm fond
of my cynicism."
1303,"01:13:51,934","01:13:54,132",It's very comfortable.
1304,"01:13:54,134","01:13:56,665","- Like a warm blanket of your own shit.
- Yes. Yes."
1305,"01:13:56,667","01:13:58,632","I'm very comfortable
and warm"
1306,"01:13:58,634","01:14:01,134","in my fucking warm blanket
of fucking shit."
1307,"01:14:05,067","01:14:07,565","But what if
we're falling in love?"
1308,"01:14:07,567","01:14:08,832",Dear God...
1309,"01:14:08,834","01:14:11,632","I mean, what if this
is what it's like?"
1310,"01:14:11,634","01:14:13,465","It would end
in disaster."
1311,"01:14:13,467","01:14:14,832","- What if it didn't?
- It would."
1312,"01:14:14,834","01:14:16,634","- I know.
- Good."
1313,"01:14:19,567","01:14:21,765","- But...
- Stop."
1314,"01:14:21,767","01:14:23,134","- Ah...
- Stop."
1315,"01:14:24,634","01:14:27,632",But...
1316,"01:14:34,834","01:14:36,600",Oh!
1317,"01:14:40,700","01:14:42,665","This is not funny. Don't
laugh at me, please."
1318,"01:14:42,667","01:14:45,165","I'm laughing
out of affection."
1319,"01:14:45,167","01:14:47,132","No one laughs at another
person out of affection."
1320,"01:14:47,134","01:14:49,032","You laugh at another
person out of contempt."
1321,"01:14:49,034","01:14:51,132","No. I'm laughing
'cause it's cute."
1322,"01:14:51,134","01:14:52,665","- It is?
- Yes."
1323,"01:14:52,667","01:14:54,465","But, fine,
I'll stop laughing."
1324,"01:14:54,467","01:14:55,467",Thank you.
1325,"01:15:00,567","01:15:02,099","- Frank?
- Yes?"
1326,"01:15:02,101","01:15:05,198","Don't you, like,
have an instinct about me?"
1327,"01:15:05,200","01:15:06,467",Nope.
1328,"01:15:08,101","01:15:10,798",I think you do.
1329,"01:15:10,800","01:15:13,598","You're the one who said
your gut can't be trusted."
1330,"01:15:13,600","01:15:14,965",That's true.
1331,"01:15:14,967","01:15:17,531","For a long time,
it's been a lying bitch."
1332,"01:15:17,533","01:15:19,698","But I would have been willing
to give it another shot."
1333,"01:15:19,700","01:15:21,698","Why? I mean, how much shit
has to fall on your head"
1334,"01:15:21,700","01:15:23,531","before you start
wearing a hat?"
1335,"01:15:23,533","01:15:26,732","You can't die from jumping
out of a basement window."
1336,"01:15:26,734","01:15:29,467","Of course you can. You can hit
your head on a pipe or something."
1337,"01:15:32,834","01:15:34,999","You're going to wish you
embraced the miracle, Frank."
1338,"01:15:35,001","01:15:36,600",You're gonna wish you had.
1339,"01:16:15,734","01:16:18,164","How are your pants,
John Wayne Bobbitt?"
1340,"01:16:18,166","01:16:20,133",Sticky.
1341,"01:16:27,500","01:16:30,465","We shouldn't exchange
contact information."
1342,"01:16:30,467","01:16:32,032",There's no point.
1343,"01:16:32,034","01:16:33,600","I think
I just said that."
1344,"01:16:35,133","01:16:37,732","It was very nice
to meet you."
1345,"01:16:37,734","01:16:39,867","It was very nice
to meet you too."
1346,"01:16:46,500","01:16:48,164","I know what
you're going to say..."
1347,"01:16:48,166","01:16:50,932","- ""It's not you, it's me.""
- No, it's you."
1348,"01:16:50,934","01:16:53,231",It's me.
1349,"01:16:53,233","01:16:54,698","Yeah.
I know."
1350,"01:16:54,700","01:16:56,965","- It's you.
- I... Yep."
1351,"01:17:12,967","01:17:14,467","I liked the bow
though."
1352,"01:17:29,166","01:17:32,198","Why didn't we meet
seven years ago, Frank?"
1353,"01:17:32,200","01:17:33,767","Just lucky, I guess."
1354,"01:17:38,066","01:17:41,198","14 Catalina Drive,
Newport Beach, please?"
1355,"01:17:41,200","01:17:43,798","What are you doing?
Don't give your exact address."
1356,"01:17:43,800","01:17:45,166","You don't know
who the driver is."
1357,"01:17:46,734","01:17:48,798",Thank you for caring.
1358,"01:17:48,800","01:17:50,667","I don't. I would've
said the same to anyone."
1359,"01:17:52,667","01:17:54,665","We're holding up
the line, Frank."
1360,"01:17:54,667","01:17:56,467","There are other people
in the world."
1361,"01:17:57,533","01:17:58,867",There are?
1362,"01:18:39,234","01:18:41,033",Do you have a whistle?
1363,"01:18:55,867","01:18:57,632",And then taxation.
1364,"01:18:57,634","01:19:00,632","We get shut down
every single time by your..."
1365,"01:19:00,634","01:19:02,798","- Idea you have so far.
- No, no, no."
1366,"01:19:02,800","01:19:04,165","Can I speak?
Can I speak?"
1367,"01:19:04,167","01:19:05,199","- Please.
- Because of your..."
1368,"01:19:05,201","01:19:06,299","- Hold on. Hold on.
- That's what I..."
1369,"01:19:06,301","01:19:08,865","- Just wait a second, all right?
- I'm working on it."
1370,"01:19:11,100","01:19:13,765","It's the guys who
stand by in all their philosophies"
1371,"01:19:13,767","01:19:16,531","and all their ideas and
everything that they represent."
1372,"01:19:16,533","01:19:18,132","They're talking about
the silent majority."
1373,"01:19:18,134","01:19:20,465","I don't know.
I mean, listen,"
1374,"01:19:20,467","01:19:22,798","- if you look at the facts again...
- Hold on."
1375,"01:19:22,800","01:19:24,698","They're having a sidebar here.
Hold on."
1376,"01:19:24,700","01:19:27,098","How can we even bring
that up at this point?"
1377,"01:19:27,100","01:19:28,765","- But what fact?
- In the media."
1378,"01:19:28,767","01:19:29,964",You're not getting paid here.
1379,"01:19:29,966","01:19:32,232","You have got to look
at what your guy did too."
1380,"01:19:32,234","01:19:33,798","Oh, really?
There it is again."
1381,"01:19:33,800","01:19:35,498","There's the same thing
right there."
1382,"01:19:35,500","01:19:37,865","It's the same response
for the other side. Yeah."
1383,"01:19:37,867","01:19:40,732","Yeah, but never mind
because your guy was worse..."
