1,"00:00:32,916","00:00:34,250","So, you've been good, right?"
2,"00:00:34,333","00:00:35,916","I mean, other than this?"
3,"00:00:36,000","00:00:38,541","He seems okay.
At least better than how I was picturing."
4,"00:00:38,625","00:00:40,583","Not too different
than last time I was here."
5,"00:00:40,666","00:00:43,392","Hard to tell whether he's in pain.
I mean, at least while he's asleep."
6,"00:00:43,416","00:00:45,166","But you've been on top of that, yes?"
7,"00:00:45,250","00:00:49,041","Because I think that's the thing,
is for it to be as painless as possible."
8,"00:00:49,125","00:00:51,041","The trick is, I guess,
the thing I'm saying"
9,"00:00:51,125","00:00:53,250","is that I hope
we can make this easy on him."
10,"00:00:53,333","00:00:55,041","Just not make a thing
out of anything."
11,"00:00:55,125","00:00:57,725","If we disagree, we talk it out
without getting heated, or yelling,"
12,"00:00:57,750","00:00:59,416",or anything that's going to upset him.
13,"00:00:59,500","00:01:02,166","We handle it like adults,
like the age we are."
14,"00:01:02,250","00:01:04,559","I really don't see what there is
to disagree about anyways."
15,"00:01:04,583","00:01:06,750","At the end of the day,
the hard truth is he's dying."
16,"00:01:06,833","00:01:09,541","There's nothing either one of us can do
to stop that from happening."
17,"00:01:09,625","00:01:12,267","I'm not trying to be cold,
but it's a matter of being there for him,"
18,"00:01:12,291","00:01:13,375",being here.
19,"00:01:13,458","00:01:15,833","Things from the past don't matter,
not right now."
20,"00:01:15,916","00:01:17,833","If there are things to work out,
they can wait."
21,"00:01:17,916","00:01:19,375",I really hope you agree.
22,"00:01:19,458","00:01:22,583","I'm upset. I know you are too.
We all are. It's hard. It sucks."
23,"00:01:22,666","00:01:24,458","Let's not make it harder, okay?"
24,"00:01:24,541","00:01:25,583",I did see...
25,"00:01:26,250","00:01:29,208","I did see that the DNR
never got signed like I asked."
26,"00:01:29,291","00:01:30,416",Quite a few times.
27,"00:01:30,500","00:01:31,791","I got it, it's not that easy."
28,"00:01:31,875","00:01:34,500","Well, it was easy, actually.
Now it's a lot harder."
29,"00:01:34,583","00:01:35,703",I'm not making this a thing.
30,"00:01:35,750","00:01:38,416","I'm just saying it's harder now
that he's not seeing doctors."
31,"00:01:38,500","00:01:41,458","I have to get Dr. Sanders here,
or someone who can witness his signature,"
32,"00:01:41,541","00:01:44,291","and it would've been just a lot simpler
when you were taking him in."
33,"00:01:44,375","00:01:45,833",I don't know how much time I have.
34,"00:01:45,916","00:01:46,874",He has.
35,"00:01:46,875","00:01:48,166",It's important.
36,"00:01:48,250","00:01:49,583",It's really important.
37,"00:01:54,500","00:01:57,208",He opened his eyes for a bit.
38,"00:01:57,291","00:01:59,375",That was nice. He knows we're here.
39,"00:01:59,458","00:02:01,125",I could tell that made him happy.
40,"00:02:01,791","00:02:03,750",I know.
41,"00:02:04,958","00:02:06,833","I promise I won't be like this
the whole time."
42,"00:02:06,916","00:02:09,375","I'm not going to just cry through it all.
Just for now."
43,"00:02:10,958","00:02:13,875","It's weird to be away, you know,
from Mirabella and David."
44,"00:02:13,958","00:02:15,166",That's part of it.
45,"00:02:15,250","00:02:17,809","- It's really my first time.
- You could've brought them."
46,"00:02:17,833","00:02:19,750","No, no, it's good they're not here."
47,"00:02:19,833","00:02:21,041",They're fine.
48,"00:02:21,125","00:02:23,458","I'd rather the memory be
from our last visit."
49,"00:02:23,541","00:02:26,541","He was better.
That's what hurts about this more."
50,"00:02:26,625","00:02:31,416","He was still sick, of course,
but he was still so there,"
51,"00:02:31,500","00:02:33,083",so able.
52,"00:02:33,833","00:02:37,333","I just didn't think things
would get to this, not so suddenly."
53,"00:02:37,416","00:02:41,166","I've seen too many movies, probably,
especially the ones made for children."
54,"00:02:41,250","00:02:45,166","With Mirabella these past couple of years,
everything's so nice, bright."
55,"00:02:45,791","00:02:47,541","Even if they get heavy,"
56,"00:02:47,625","00:02:49,958",there's a beauty and clarity to it all.
57,"00:02:50,041","00:02:51,708",This feels so real.
58,"00:02:51,791","00:02:53,708",I'm rambling. I'm sorry. It's the jet lag.
59,"00:02:53,791","00:02:55,541",I get even more emotional when I fly.
60,"00:02:57,500","00:02:58,500",Anyway...
61,"00:02:59,375","00:03:01,291","It's nice that it's us, just us."
62,"00:03:01,375","00:03:03,833","This is the way it should be.
The way he would want it."
63,"00:03:05,000","00:03:07,708","I interrupted something.
I'm sorry."
64,"00:03:07,791","00:03:10,791","How are you, Rachel? I feel like
we haven't spoken since Thanksgiving."
65,"00:03:10,875","00:03:11,875",How are you?
66,"00:03:13,583","00:03:14,583",I'm all good.
67,"00:03:17,666","00:03:21,125","I don't know what you want me to say.
I'm good. That's basically it."
68,"00:03:21,208","00:03:24,333","Well, she's definitely high.
The whole place stinks like weed."
69,"00:03:24,416","00:03:25,833","Fuck yeah, I'm high."
70,"00:03:25,916","00:03:27,083",High as a motherfucker.
71,"00:03:27,166","00:03:29,333","First thing I do in the morning
is I roll a blunt,"
72,"00:03:29,416","00:03:31,875","then I smoke at least three
more throughout the day."
73,"00:03:31,958","00:03:34,041",You know why? ‘Cause that's how I do shit.
74,"00:03:34,125","00:03:35,405","I don't care that
you smoke weed."
75,"00:03:35,458","00:03:38,017","It's just not right to smoke it
in the house when someone is sick."
76,"00:03:38,041","00:03:39,083","Well, Daddy doesn't mind."
77,"00:03:39,166","00:03:41,458","Uh, trust me, I've been smoking
around him all this time,"
78,"00:03:41,541","00:03:43,166",and he never had an issue.
79,"00:03:43,250","00:03:45,875","In fact, he likes the smell."
80,"00:03:45,958","00:03:47,158",Told me more than a few times.
81,"00:03:47,208","00:03:50,791","It's the smoke. The smoke, not the smell.
The man is dying. Just go outside."
82,"00:03:50,875","00:03:52,666","Damn, it took you five minutes."
83,"00:03:52,750","00:03:55,708","Five minutes, right?
To just get in my shit."
84,"00:03:55,791","00:03:57,583","A second ago it was,
""Let's just get along."""
85,"00:03:57,666","00:04:00,833","Yes. Yes. Let's settle down.
There's no reason for this to be an issue."
86,"00:04:00,916","00:04:03,333","And for her to take her shitty weed
and smoke it outside."
87,"00:04:03,416","00:04:04,416",Shitty weed?
88,"00:04:04,500","00:04:06,458","Oh, please. No, I get top-shelf."
89,"00:04:06,541","00:04:08,666","Not that dog shit
you smoked all day long, right?"
90,"00:04:08,750","00:04:10,809","- You think I forgot?
- That was high school."
91,"00:04:10,833","00:04:13,000","I've grown up quite a lot since then,
unlike others."
92,"00:04:13,083","00:04:14,166",Grown up? Still a bitch.
93,"00:04:14,250","00:04:16,875","Rachel, Katie, no.
Let's just stop."
94,"00:04:17,625","00:04:18,625",Look.
95,"00:04:19,333","00:04:21,500",Hi. Were you trying to find us?
96,"00:04:22,083","00:04:23,958","Please, please. Come sit down."
97,"00:04:29,291","00:04:31,750","- I'm sorry, we were...
- No. No need to apologize."
98,"00:04:31,833","00:04:34,250","I understand
what a stressful situation it is."
99,"00:04:34,333","00:04:35,750",It's natural.
100,"00:04:35,833","00:04:36,833",It's a hard time.
101,"00:04:37,291","00:04:39,916","While my partner Mirabella
was in the room with your father,"
102,"00:04:40,000","00:04:42,351","I was hoping to talk you through
where we are at the moment."
103,"00:04:42,375","00:04:43,375","""Mirabella""?"
104,"00:04:43,458","00:04:45,000",That's my daughter's name.
105,"00:04:45,666","00:04:48,708","- Wow.
- Really? It's a beautiful name."
106,"00:04:48,791","00:04:50,625","- She's three.
- Oh, that's nice."
107,"00:04:51,250","00:04:54,291","It's also very nice
that you're all here at a time like this."
108,"00:04:54,375","00:04:56,125",It's not always like that.
109,"00:04:56,208","00:04:57,458",Things happen in families.
110,"00:04:57,541","00:05:00,375","Sometimes people can't be here
because of medical reasons."
111,"00:05:00,458","00:05:03,416","Sometimes it's just,
you know, other things."
112,"00:05:04,416","00:05:06,291","I understand his wife passed
some years ago."
113,"00:05:06,375","00:05:07,375",He was married twice.
114,"00:05:07,458","00:05:08,458","Yes, she did."
115,"00:05:08,500","00:05:11,666","Breast cancer about 20 years ago, right?"
116,"00:05:11,750","00:05:14,350","Sorry to hear that.
I don't know what that process was like,"
117,"00:05:14,416","00:05:17,458","but I think it would be helpful
to understand the process here"
118,"00:05:17,541","00:05:19,625","now that your father's
off food and liquid."
119,"00:05:19,708","00:05:22,416","I, or Mirabella,
or both of us, if possible,"
120,"00:05:22,500","00:05:25,125","will be here each morning
around this time,"
121,"00:05:25,208","00:05:27,916",but you will have my number.
122,"00:05:28,000","00:05:31,791","I'll do my best to answer any questions
or come here if need be."
123,"00:05:33,875","00:05:37,083",It will be us you call when he does pass.
124,"00:05:37,791","00:05:39,231",We can make the declaration of death
125,"00:05:39,291","00:05:42,041","unless a medical reason brings him
to the hospital beforehand."
126,"00:05:42,125","00:05:45,166","I'm sorry.
It's just so weird that's her name."
127,"00:05:45,250","00:05:47,708","I keep picturing my daughter
when you mention her."
128,"00:05:48,750","00:05:50,708","Please, go on. Sorry."
129,"00:05:50,791","00:05:51,791","So,"
130,"00:05:52,250","00:05:55,750","it's good news that your father
responds well to the pain treatment."
131,"00:05:56,833","00:05:59,666","His cancer is very advanced,
and when we are in pain,"
132,"00:05:59,750","00:06:01,333","our bodies naturally try to fight it,"
133,"00:06:01,416","00:06:04,166","even if it's actually just
hurting us more."
134,"00:06:04,916","00:06:08,916","His ease will possibly quicken
the process in a organic way."
135,"00:06:09,000","00:06:12,625","That's really the big difference
between hospice and hospital care,"
136,"00:06:12,708","00:06:14,250",which aims to extend life.
137,"00:06:15,000","00:06:17,333","As painless as possible
is our goal always."
138,"00:06:17,416","00:06:19,000","But another thing is,"
139,"00:06:19,083","00:06:21,963","it's not just our bodies that affect
the length of time it takes to pass."
140,"00:06:22,500","00:06:23,976","I can't tell you the science on this,"
141,"00:06:24,000","00:06:26,434","but I can tell you in the 12 years
I've been working in hospice,"
142,"00:06:26,458","00:06:28,625","it has become very clear to me
that the mind"
143,"00:06:28,708","00:06:30,791",is just as big a factor as the body.
144,"00:06:30,875","00:06:32,715","And that's really where
you can be a huge help,"
145,"00:06:32,750","00:06:35,750","in case he's holding on,
not wanting to go out of fear."
146,"00:06:35,833","00:06:39,125","You can help by letting him know,
by reassuring him,"
147,"00:06:39,208","00:06:40,500",that it's okay.
148,"00:06:41,666","00:06:44,142","The mind doesn't have the power
to heal or reverse the disease,"
149,"00:06:44,166","00:06:45,083","not at the stage it is,"
150,"00:06:45,166","00:06:47,708","but if he knows he'll be okay,"
151,"00:06:48,375","00:06:49,916","that you all will be okay,"
152,"00:06:50,833","00:06:52,458",it could mean a great deal.
153,"00:06:54,666","00:06:56,458","- Sorry. Angel, right?
- Mm-hmm."
154,"00:06:56,541","00:06:58,625","Angel, that's quite a name
considering what you do."
155,"00:06:58,708","00:06:59,833","I... I wanted to ask you,"
156,"00:06:59,916","00:07:03,208","my father was supposed to sign a DNR,
a do-not-resuscitate form."
157,"00:07:03,291","00:07:07,041","But for whatever reason, it didn't happen
while he was still going to his doctors."
158,"00:07:07,125","00:07:08,565","It's still important to him, though,"
159,"00:07:08,625","00:07:11,166","which is why I wanted to know
how much time he had."
160,"00:07:11,250","00:07:13,041",I get it. It's not a simple math equation.
161,"00:07:13,125","00:07:14,125","Well, he wasn't clear."
162,"00:07:14,166","00:07:18,208","It sounds like it could happen anytime,
or it could be a few days, maybe longer."
163,"00:07:18,291","00:07:19,931",You should see him. He doesn't look well.
164,"00:07:19,958","00:07:21,638","It was only a month ago
I saw him, I think,"
165,"00:07:21,666","00:07:23,916","but it seems like years
looking at him now."
166,"00:07:24,625","00:07:27,583","The plan is, at least at the moment,
I'll stay here."
167,"00:07:27,666","00:07:29,958",We all will take turns watching over.
168,"00:07:30,041","00:07:31,916",We'll be together when it happens.
169,"00:07:32,000","00:07:34,767","I'm sure that if I left, the moment I left
and got too far to rush back"
170,"00:07:34,791","00:07:36,500","is when it would happen, you know?"
171,"00:07:37,416","00:07:38,666",Can you hear that?
172,"00:07:38,750","00:07:41,791","That's Christina singing to him
in his room right now."
173,"00:07:41,875","00:07:44,208","I don't know. Let's just hope
it's not the Grateful Dead."
174,"00:07:44,291","00:07:47,625","That would kill him right away.
He hated that music as much as I did."
175,"00:07:48,375","00:07:51,291","She's fine. She's good.
At least, she appears to be, like always."
176,"00:07:51,875","00:07:55,125","Hope the singing doesn't go on too much.
Could kill me."
177,"00:07:56,375","00:07:58,083",She's...
178,"00:07:58,166","00:08:00,041",She's exactly who she's always been.
179,"00:08:00,125","00:08:03,000","I asked her to do one simple thing,
get the damn DNR signed,"
180,"00:08:03,083","00:08:05,375","which now is much more
complicated to do."
181,"00:08:05,458","00:08:08,258","I was hoping the hospice guy could help,
but it seems I need to somehow"
182,"00:08:08,291","00:08:11,708","get a physician here to the house
and time it again, somehow,"
183,"00:08:11,791","00:08:14,041","to know when he's awake
and somewhat coherent."
184,"00:08:14,541","00:08:15,375",She's out now.
185,"00:08:15,458","00:08:17,809","I asked her to stop smoking in the house,
and she got upset."
186,"00:08:17,833","00:08:20,559","It's like she can't wait till he's dead
so the apartment will be hers."
187,"00:08:20,583","00:08:23,041","See if I give a fuck
what she does in here after that."
188,"00:08:23,125","00:08:24,583",Not my responsibility.
189,"00:08:50,458","00:08:51,541","Rachel, what are you doing?"
190,"00:08:51,625","00:08:53,416",You know you can't be doing that out here.
191,"00:08:54,041","00:08:55,166",Victor!
192,"00:08:58,291","00:09:00,208","Ah. What the fuck are you doing, man?"
193,"00:09:00,291","00:09:02,059",Fucking my whole shit up.
194,"00:09:02,083","00:09:04,083","You shouldn't be doing
your whole shit here."
195,"00:09:04,166","00:09:05,166",That's the problem.
196,"00:09:05,833","00:09:07,291",Shit's legal now.
197,"00:09:07,375","00:09:09,434","What, are you stuck in the ‘90s
when you last blazed?"
198,"00:09:09,458","00:09:10,875",Please.
199,"00:09:10,958","00:09:12,208","I smoke every night,"
200,"00:09:12,291","00:09:15,166","but when I get home,
inside my own apartment."
201,"00:09:15,250","00:09:16,666",You know how it is here.
202,"00:09:16,750","00:09:20,250","These people lose it
when someone smokes a cigarette out here."
203,"00:09:20,333","00:09:22,958",They ask me to call the cops. It's crazy.
204,"00:09:23,958","00:09:25,625","Look, why aren't you inside,"
205,"00:09:25,708","00:09:27,541","where I can just call you
with a complaint,"
206,"00:09:27,625","00:09:29,916",and you can tell me to go fuck myself?
207,"00:09:30,000","00:09:31,208","Okay, uh,"
208,"00:09:32,375","00:09:33,375",last one.
209,"00:09:45,958","00:09:48,083","You know, it's my bitch-ass sister, huh?"
210,"00:09:48,166","00:09:51,958","She's trying to tell me
the smoke is killing our dad."
211,"00:09:52,750","00:09:54,166",How is Vinnie?
212,"00:09:54,250","00:09:57,291","Oh, he's fucking dying,
but not ‘cause of my weed smoke."
213,"00:09:57,375","00:09:59,125","Uh, she's just a fucking, uh..."
214,"00:10:00,000","00:10:01,625",It's always gotta be something.
215,"00:10:01,708","00:10:04,833","And now she's got me out here
trying to chill, getting yelled at by you."
216,"00:10:04,916","00:10:06,708","No disrespect.
You know I love you, Victor,"
217,"00:10:06,791","00:10:09,958","but, uh, she's the one
you should be yelling at, not me."
218,"00:10:10,041","00:10:11,041","I, uh..."
219,"00:10:11,708","00:10:13,958","I'm just trying to maintain, you know?"
220,"00:10:17,333","00:10:19,375","Hey, do you want
to come in and join us?"
221,"00:10:19,458","00:10:20,666","The nurse is about to show up,"
222,"00:10:20,750","00:10:22,950","and we could all circle around him
before she gets here."
223,"00:10:23,000","00:10:24,041",We could sing to him.
224,"00:10:24,125","00:10:26,809","Or if you want, you and he could
be alone together. That's fine, too."
225,"00:10:26,833","00:10:29,208","He's just sleeping,
but he looks super peaceful."
226,"00:10:29,791","00:10:30,791",Are you sure?
227,"00:10:31,916","00:10:32,958",Okay.
228,"00:10:33,041","00:10:34,750","Well, if you change your mind."
229,"00:10:35,291","00:10:39,000","I don't want you to feel like
we've invaded your space at all."
230,"00:10:49,083","00:10:50,083",Christina?
231,"00:10:50,833","00:10:51,833",Christina.
232,"00:10:55,041","00:10:56,041",Yeah?
233,"00:10:58,000","00:10:59,333",This is what's in here.
234,"00:10:59,416","00:11:01,375","Not just one bag of apples, three bags."
235,"00:11:01,458","00:11:03,458",And you know what? All of them look old.
236,"00:11:03,541","00:11:06,708","They've gone soft, and that's it.
Seriously, you can see for yourself."
237,"00:11:06,791","00:11:07,958","Three bags of apples,"
238,"00:11:08,041","00:11:10,333","some old condiments
from who knows when, and that's it."
239,"00:11:10,875","00:11:12,416","I mean, really, how old is she?"
240,"00:11:12,500","00:11:14,333","I can run out now
and do some shopping."
241,"00:11:14,416","00:11:16,750","No, I'll go, but that's not the point."
242,"00:11:16,833","00:11:19,541","Damien is nine,
and he can take better care of himself."
243,"00:11:19,625","00:11:22,708","The moment Dad wasn't able,
I mean, this is all she got."
244,"00:11:22,791","00:11:24,031",That's just the last few weeks.
245,"00:11:24,083","00:11:26,250","What the hell is gonna happen
to her afterwards?"
246,"00:11:26,333","00:11:28,500","I can tell you one thing,
it's not gonna be us."
247,"00:11:28,583","00:11:31,023","You live across the country
and have a family to take care of."
248,"00:11:31,083","00:11:34,416","And I have enough on my plate with my own.
More than enough."
249,"00:11:34,500","00:11:37,666","She is so fucked,
but it can't become my problem."
250,"00:11:38,291","00:11:40,416",She's out shopping right now.
251,"00:11:40,500","00:11:41,958","Yeah, she's staying here too."
252,"00:11:42,041","00:11:44,958","We're taking shifts watching over him.
There's a nurse in with him now."
253,"00:11:45,041","00:11:47,791","She comes for four hours
each day around now."
254,"00:11:49,041","00:11:50,041",It's fine.
255,"00:11:50,833","00:11:52,625","No, I can't guess how long."
256,"00:11:52,708","00:11:55,666","No one can.
And I don't want to guess, but..."
257,"00:11:55,750","00:11:57,666",...I think I'll be home soon.
258,"00:11:59,458","00:12:00,458",It's fine.
259,"00:12:01,208","00:12:02,291",It's fine. Thanks.
260,"00:12:02,875","00:12:05,958","I just want to hear how things are there.
Are you guys having fun?"
261,"00:12:07,875","00:12:11,166","...see if they go right back
to Kadeem Jack."
262,"00:12:14,458","00:12:15,333",Here's Jack.
263,"00:12:15,416","00:12:17,041",Hangs in the air...
264,"00:12:17,125","00:12:19,708",...and commits the offensive foul.
265,"00:12:21,875","00:12:23,833",Personal foul on Jack.
266,"00:12:25,083","00:12:27,726","What they got him with,
Eric, nice rip-through move,"
267,"00:12:27,750","00:12:30,250","but watch the inside or left arm.
Good call."
268,"00:12:30,333","00:12:31,250",He's...
269,"00:12:31,333","00:12:34,000","I miss you.
I miss you both so damn much."
270,"00:12:34,083","00:12:35,283","It hasn't even been a day yet,"
271,"00:12:35,333","00:12:38,083","and all I can think about
is getting back there to you both."
272,"00:12:38,166","00:12:40,916",‘Cause this is so not home anymore.
273,"00:12:41,000","00:12:43,208","I'm so lucky.
No, you have no idea. Trust me..."
274,"00:12:43,291","00:12:45,309","...starting five
that began the game."
275,"00:12:45,333","00:12:48,250","Dekker out dealing
with concussion-like symptoms."
276,"00:12:48,333","00:12:49,333",Is that her?
277,"00:12:49,875","00:12:50,875",Yes?
278,"00:12:51,333","00:12:53,000","Yes, please."
279,"00:12:55,125","00:12:57,166",My angel.
280,"00:12:58,541","00:13:01,250","Yes. Yes, it's me. It's Mommy."
281,"00:13:01,333","00:13:05,125","Hello, my sweet,
beautiful Mirabella."
282,"00:13:07,000","00:13:08,500",Have you been missing me?
283,"00:13:09,333","00:13:12,166","I heard you've been having
so much fun with Papa."
284,"00:13:13,208","00:13:17,333","No. I'm crying because I'm just so happy
to be hearing your voice. Mommy's not sad."
285,"00:13:17,416","00:13:18,416",She's...
286,"00:13:19,166","00:13:21,375",She's happy because she loves you
287,"00:13:21,458","00:13:23,250",and cannot wait to see you.
288,"00:13:24,375","00:13:25,750","Mirabella, do you know what?"
289,"00:13:25,833","00:13:27,083",I met a woman today.
290,"00:13:27,166","00:13:28,458",She helps people.
291,"00:13:28,541","00:13:29,833",She's like a doctor.
292,"00:13:29,916","00:13:31,541","Well, she is... she is a doctor."
293,"00:13:31,625","00:13:33,333",And guess what her name is.
294,"00:13:46,625","00:13:47,833",How does he seem?
295,"00:13:47,916","00:13:49,250",He's still asleep.
296,"00:13:49,333","00:13:51,083",We have another half hour with the nurse.
297,"00:13:51,166","00:13:54,416","Ale... Aleswon... Alejuan...
Alijan. She's nice."
298,"00:13:54,500","00:13:56,541","- Do we feed her? There's enough.
- I can ask."
299,"00:13:56,625","00:13:57,916",Maybe. Yes.
300,"00:13:58,000","00:14:00,392","She probably wants to get home.
Who knows how long she has to travel."
301,"00:14:00,416","00:14:02,208","But, yes, I think. Let's offer."
302,"00:14:02,291","00:14:04,375","If anything, it will help
if she doesn't hate us."
303,"00:14:05,541","00:14:07,166",And what about her?
304,"00:14:08,125","00:14:10,166",I don't want to intrude on her privacy.
305,"00:14:17,541","00:14:19,750","I'll let her know there's food
and she's invited."
306,"00:14:19,833","00:14:22,458","Right. Right, I made food for her.
You can tell her that."
307,"00:14:22,541","00:14:24,041",I made food for her if she wants.
308,"00:14:24,125","00:14:26,041","Let the nurse know, and then let her know."
309,"00:14:30,000","00:14:32,958","Anything green. I have no idea why.
If it's green, she won't eat it."
310,"00:14:33,041","00:14:36,416","We have seriously considered
dyeing her food, just a little food color."
311,"00:14:36,500","00:14:39,000","Seriously. I mean, she wouldn't know
if a cucumber was purple."
312,"00:14:39,083","00:14:39,916",Hmm.
313,"00:14:40,000","00:14:42,250","Well, maybe it would confuse her
when she gets older."
314,"00:14:42,333","00:14:45,250","Well, you can count on that.
Won't be the only thing."
315,"00:14:45,333","00:14:47,416","Lots of things to confuse them
when they get older."
316,"00:14:47,500","00:14:49,750","Have things
become a bit better?"
317,"00:14:49,833","00:14:50,666",With Tracey?
318,"00:14:50,750","00:14:52,916","Better is relative.
What do you mean better?"
319,"00:14:53,000","00:14:54,458",Is she talking to us? Yes.
320,"00:14:54,541","00:14:56,875","Is she a full-of-shit,
snotty teenager most of the time,"
321,"00:14:56,958","00:14:59,666","treating us, me especially, like an enemy"
322,"00:14:59,750","00:15:02,430","whose only job as a parent is
to stop her from doing what she wants?"
323,"00:15:02,500","00:15:03,583",Yes.
324,"00:15:03,666","00:15:05,500",I don't... I don't...
325,"00:15:05,583","00:15:06,750","Let's not, okay?"
326,"00:15:17,916","00:15:19,166",How do you like the food?
327,"00:15:29,708","00:15:30,868","- What's that?
- Food."
328,"00:15:30,916","00:15:32,791","The food that I made, are you enjoying it?"
329,"00:15:33,625","00:15:36,250","Yeah, I like the food
that you made. Uh..."
330,"00:15:37,125","00:15:39,291","Thank you for making
the food that you made."
331,"00:15:40,166","00:15:41,750",The food you made taste good.
332,"00:15:41,833","00:15:44,166","Uh, I got a parlay going.
I'm on the final team."
333,"00:15:44,250","00:15:47,041","That's why I'm looking at my phone.
I am working."
334,"00:15:47,125","00:15:49,708","You mean you're watching a game
that you bet on?"
335,"00:15:49,791","00:15:51,125","Yeah. I, uh,"
336,"00:15:51,958","00:15:55,958","bet on 413, so 10 bucks to make 270."
337,"00:15:58,125","00:16:00,250","You think watching
will change its outcome?"
338,"00:16:05,666","00:16:06,958",Thank you for the dinner.
339,"00:16:19,125","00:16:20,666",Watch her not even wash her dishes.
340,"00:17:23,583","00:17:24,958",I twirled!
341,"00:18:20,083","00:18:21,166",That's funny.
342,"00:18:22,208","00:18:23,208",Your shirt.
343,"00:18:23,916","00:18:27,666","Oh, yeah. I found it
in one of the boxes in our room."
344,"00:18:27,750","00:18:30,041","I should go through them all
and take with me what I want"
345,"00:18:30,125","00:18:31,833","and get rid of the rest, but..."
346,"00:18:32,708","00:18:35,166","Yeah, I was... I was happy to find it."
347,"00:18:35,250","00:18:37,916","You still love them,
but you don't still go to shows, do you?"
348,"00:18:38,500","00:18:41,083","I've been known to drive
a few hours if need be."
349,"00:18:41,166","00:18:42,166",John Mayer?
350,"00:18:42,666","00:18:43,666",Sure.
351,"00:18:44,458","00:18:45,791",Sure. Family's family.
352,"00:18:46,875","00:18:48,755","Weren't you asleep?
You were with him till 4:00."
353,"00:18:48,791","00:18:50,851","I can't sleep when I know
they have to get to school."
354,"00:18:50,875","00:18:51,958",I was texting all of them.
355,"00:18:52,041","00:18:53,961","Jay's worse than the kids,
but he got them there."
356,"00:18:54,000","00:18:54,875",So that's something.
357,"00:18:54,958","00:18:57,000","Tracey skipped breakfast, of course."
358,"00:18:57,083","00:18:59,291","I slept a bit before.
I'll get some more later."
359,"00:18:59,375","00:19:01,291","You know she hasn't done a shift, right?"
360,"00:19:01,375","00:19:02,375",Who?
361,"00:19:04,541","00:19:05,625","Oh, yeah."
362,"00:19:05,708","00:19:06,708",I'm not sure.
363,"00:19:07,666","00:19:09,750","I should probably get back
in there with him."
364,"00:19:09,833","00:19:12,017","- I'll just get some water.
- You don't find that strange?"
365,"00:19:12,041","00:19:14,458","Once we get here,
she steps back from all responsibility?"
366,"00:19:15,458","00:19:16,833",The coffee's still hot.
367,"00:19:16,916","00:19:18,041",Thank you.
368,"00:19:18,125","00:19:21,375","I'm working on his obituary. It'd be good
if you could read over when you can."
369,"00:19:21,458","00:19:23,125","Yes, I understand that."
370,"00:19:23,208","00:19:24,083","But if he can't do it,"
371,"00:19:24,166","00:19:26,517","I need someone to come here
who can authorize his signature."
372,"00:19:26,541","00:19:28,291",This is extremely important to him.
373,"00:19:30,500","00:19:34,500","I understand that, yes, but here we are,
and now he's too sick to go anywhere."
374,"00:19:35,166","00:19:37,750","He can die any minute,
so really, I just need a solution."
375,"00:19:41,166","00:19:43,041","Yes, please. I'll wait."
376,"00:19:44,750","00:19:47,511","- That's going to be Angel and Mirabella.
- Yep, I got it."
377,"00:20:06,291","00:20:09,500","I find that listening to that,
things will be better."
378,"00:20:09,583","00:20:10,583",Mmm.
379,"00:20:11,458","00:20:12,458",Hey.
380,"00:20:13,333","00:20:14,333",Morning.
381,"00:20:14,666","00:20:15,666","Rachel, right?"
382,"00:20:17,083","00:20:18,416",Put some clothes on and join us.
383,"00:20:18,500","00:20:21,041","Angel was just telling us about
where he thinks things are."
384,"00:20:21,125","00:20:22,125",Sure.
385,"00:20:30,166","00:20:31,291",How about some coffee?
386,"00:20:33,000","00:20:34,750","So, yeah."
387,"00:20:34,833","00:20:37,958","I was saying to your sisters
that Vincent appears to me"
388,"00:20:38,041","00:20:40,666","to be much further along
than when I saw him yesterday."
389,"00:20:40,750","00:20:42,916","I don't want to imply
that I know when he will pass."
390,"00:20:43,000","00:20:46,708","I say my guesses have been as wrong
as much as they have been right,"
391,"00:20:46,791","00:20:50,458","and I have seen a few people
in a similar condition as your father"
392,"00:20:50,541","00:20:53,250","hold on for a lot longer
than I would have thought."
393,"00:20:53,333","00:20:55,875","I'm just saying,
please prepare yourself,"
394,"00:20:55,958","00:20:58,333","especially for him
to become even less coherent."
395,"00:20:58,416","00:21:01,083","Have you been able to have
any conversations recently?"
396,"00:21:02,166","00:21:04,375","- Yes. I mean, small ones.
- Hmm."
397,"00:21:04,458","00:21:08,166","There are windows when he says a few words
in response to something."
398,"00:21:08,250","00:21:10,517","He's thought I was someone I'm not,
or asked for something"
399,"00:21:10,541","00:21:12,291",that doesn't make sense.
400,"00:21:12,375","00:21:16,125","He still seems to think that he has work
or a deadline of some kind."
401,"00:21:16,208","00:21:17,375",Work is a big one.
402,"00:21:17,458","00:21:19,791","I mean, even if the job sucked, you know,"
403,"00:21:19,875","00:21:22,375","and the person couldn't wait
for the day to retire."
404,"00:21:22,458","00:21:26,875","Even still, it could be the cycle
of familiarity that's needed right now."
405,"00:21:28,583","00:21:31,708","I'm hoping that you all will, if you want,"
406,"00:21:31,791","00:21:35,875","take any windows you can
to say anything you feel must be said."
407,"00:21:36,750","00:21:37,750",If you want.
408,"00:21:38,291","00:21:39,666",Now would be the time.
409,"00:21:39,750","00:21:41,083",This DNR form.
410,"00:21:42,083","00:21:44,226","- Right.
- It's hard to get someone here,"
411,"00:21:44,250","00:21:46,809","and now with what you were saying,
it feels even more impossible."
412,"00:21:46,833","00:21:49,541","Yes, yes. I understand
this is really important for you."
413,"00:21:49,625","00:21:50,458",For him.
414,"00:21:50,541","00:21:53,250","I know what happens,
what can happen, without one."
415,"00:21:53,333","00:21:55,708","EMTs cracked the ribs
of my close friend's mother,"
416,"00:21:55,791","00:21:56,666","almost all of them,"
417,"00:21:56,750","00:21:59,333","trying to bring her back
after she just about passed peacefully."
418,"00:21:59,416","00:22:01,750","The poor lady was left brain-dead
for another three weeks."
419,"00:22:01,833","00:22:03,375",Completely broken and bruised.
420,"00:22:03,458","00:22:05,291","And that's not something
my father wants."
421,"00:22:05,375","00:22:07,333","When he goes, he should be allowed to go."
422,"00:22:07,416","00:22:08,496","You understand that, right?"
423,"00:22:08,541","00:22:10,250",I do. I do.
424,"00:22:10,916","00:22:12,041",Sometimes...
425,"00:22:13,125","00:22:15,166","Sometimes,
people don't call EMT right away"
426,"00:22:15,250","00:22:17,583","when they believe
their loved one has passed away."
427,"00:22:18,208","00:22:20,708","Sometimes, they're not completely sure,"
428,"00:22:20,791","00:22:23,625",and that can delay that call for a while.
429,"00:22:24,625","00:22:25,791",Right. Right.
430,"00:22:25,875","00:22:28,875","But what happens if he suddenly needs
to go to the hospital for some reason?"
431,"00:22:29,375","00:22:32,750","I am a firm believer
in do-not-resuscitate orders."
432,"00:22:33,458","00:22:34,875",I just can't sign them.
433,"00:22:46,708","00:22:48,458","- Yeah?
- Here's the thing."
434,"00:22:48,541","00:22:50,221",I get that you don't wanna go in his room.
435,"00:22:50,250","00:22:52,809","Sure, I was there till 4:00 a.m.,
and Christina's been in there since."
436,"00:22:52,833","00:22:54,033",The help would be appreciated.
437,"00:22:54,083","00:22:56,934","Everyone deals with death their own way,
and I won't tell you what to do."
438,"00:22:56,958","00:22:58,000",That's between you and him
439,"00:22:58,083","00:22:59,923","and however you think
you should run your life."
440,"00:22:59,958","00:23:02,142","But what I will ask you to do
is not act like a teenager"
441,"00:23:02,166","00:23:03,526",and sneak smoking in the bathroom.
442,"00:23:03,583","00:23:05,625","It's not sneaking.
The whole place reeks of it."
443,"00:23:05,708","00:23:08,392","I'm not asking for you to do it for him,
even though he can't speak for himself."
444,"00:23:08,416","00:23:09,541",I'm asking for me.
445,"00:23:09,625","00:23:11,583","I'm asking you
to respect me and my wishes,"
446,"00:23:11,666","00:23:14,166","and while he's alive and I'm here,
to smoke outside. That's it."
447,"00:23:14,250","00:23:16,226","Afterwards, this'll be your place.
Your name's on the lease."
448,"00:23:16,250","00:23:18,351","You'll be free to do what you want,
and I'll have no say."
449,"00:23:18,375","00:23:20,495","You want rotten apples in the fridge?
Not my business."
450,"00:23:20,541","00:23:23,061","You want to do bong hits all day
and all night? Not my business."
451,"00:23:23,125","00:23:25,208","But for now,
whenever you step outside to smoke,"
452,"00:23:25,291","00:23:27,333","think, ""I am respecting Katie,"""
453,"00:23:27,416","00:23:29,916","and I'll know you are respecting me, okay?"
454,"00:23:31,083","00:23:32,083",Sure.
455,"00:23:51,833","00:23:54,153","I don't want to hear about it, Victor.
I'm not in the mood."
456,"00:23:54,208","00:23:57,041","- Rachel.
- Look, I love you, Victor, but fuck off."
457,"00:23:57,125","00:23:59,045","Just call whoever you want,
do whatever you want."
458,"00:23:59,083","00:24:02,500","I really do not give a fuck.
Shit's legal is all I know."
459,"00:24:05,291","00:24:06,458",Goddamn right.
460,"00:24:07,833","00:24:09,500",The fuck out of here with that bullshit.
461,"00:24:15,666","00:24:17,041",How you doing? You doing okay?
462,"00:24:17,125","00:24:19,458","You know, you know.
Just trying to get by."
463,"00:24:19,541","00:24:21,625","Oh yeah, I do know."
464,"00:24:21,708","00:24:23,208","I sure do know, brother."
465,"00:24:23,708","00:24:25,851","I'd say take a seat,
but I see you got the little ones."
466,"00:24:25,875","00:24:26,875","Oh, it's all good."
467,"00:24:26,958","00:24:30,166","Oh, they'll be out here soon enough.
Don't worry about it."
468,"00:24:30,250","00:24:32,291","Lighting up a big fatty of their own, huh?"
469,"00:24:32,375","00:24:35,166","- Don't I know it. Don't I know it.
- Yeah."
470,"00:24:36,541","00:24:37,625",Fucking kids.
471,"00:24:53,500","00:24:55,750","I came out, thought I'd get a bit of air."
472,"00:24:57,541","00:25:00,916","It's easy to forget
the outside exists, you know?"
473,"00:25:01,000","00:25:03,000",It's good to step out and take a breath.
474,"00:25:06,833","00:25:11,458","I haven't sat here for a long time,
probably years,"
475,"00:25:11,541","00:25:14,500",but it's... it's nice. I forgot about it.
476,"00:25:16,458","00:25:19,291","I definitely remember taking
some time out here just sitting."
477,"00:25:19,375","00:25:21,250",I remember needing it.
478,"00:25:22,250","00:25:25,375","It's strange the things we forget,
the things that are good for you,"
479,"00:25:25,458","00:25:28,583","like just stepping out of things
for a minute."
480,"00:25:31,666","00:25:32,666",How are you?
481,"00:25:33,208","00:25:35,500","I know this can't be easy,"
482,"00:25:35,583","00:25:38,333","having Katie and I invade your space
the way we have."
483,"00:25:38,416","00:25:40,208","Uh, it's not my space."
484,"00:25:40,291","00:25:42,875","No. Well, it is.
I mean, it's Dad's and yours,"
485,"00:25:42,958","00:25:46,625","but, you know,
soon it will be yours."
486,"00:25:47,250","00:25:48,809","I'm planning on getting my storage out,"
487,"00:25:48,833","00:25:51,000","either in the garbage
or back home with me."
488,"00:25:51,500","00:25:53,500","I'm sorry I left things in there
as long as I have."
489,"00:25:53,541","00:25:55,541",I... I won't leave you with that.
490,"00:25:55,625","00:25:57,666","Uh, I don't care."
491,"00:25:57,750","00:25:59,750","It's not in my room, not my business."
492,"00:25:59,833","00:26:03,208","Well, I do. And I'm just saying
there's no reason for it to stay there."
493,"00:26:03,291","00:26:04,541",I have plenty of space.
494,"00:26:05,041","00:26:06,583",Too much space.
495,"00:26:07,458","00:26:10,708","I guess enough for another child
when the time comes,"
496,"00:26:10,791","00:26:13,000","but Mirabella's a handful
as it is, you know?"
497,"00:26:13,083","00:26:16,375","It's hard to imagine two,
but they say it gets easier."
498,"00:26:17,583","00:26:19,291",That's what they say at least.
499,"00:26:19,375","00:26:20,666",I know David's ready.
500,"00:26:22,000","00:26:23,000",What about you?
501,"00:26:25,291","00:26:26,541",What about me?
502,"00:26:26,625","00:26:27,625",Kids.
503,"00:26:27,958","00:26:29,250",Do you want children?
504,"00:26:30,375","00:26:31,791","I'm sorry, but you're crazy."
505,"00:26:31,875","00:26:33,750","No offense, just kind of nuts."
506,"00:26:34,791","00:26:35,791",I am?
507,"00:26:38,166","00:26:39,833","What do you mean ""crazy""?"
508,"00:26:39,916","00:26:42,541","How? In what way, really?"
509,"00:26:42,625","00:26:43,791","Uh, I don't know."
510,"00:26:43,875","00:26:45,795","Maybe it's all those mushrooms
and shit you took."
511,"00:26:45,833","00:26:48,125","Fucking Grateful Dead.
I mean, that's some wacky shit."
512,"00:26:50,375","00:26:51,375",Yeah.
513,"00:26:52,916","00:26:53,916","Yeah, right."
514,"00:27:01,166","00:27:03,083",You know... Hmm...
515,"00:27:04,583","00:27:07,541","You know, it's not really like that."
516,"00:27:07,625","00:27:09,500","I'm sure for some, but..."
517,"00:27:11,208","00:27:13,250",it was never about that for me.
518,"00:27:15,000","00:27:18,750","Okay, okay, I'm just playing.
I... I'm high. That's it. Forget it."
519,"00:27:18,833","00:27:21,958","Uh, no, no.
I am not thinking of having kids."
520,"00:27:22,041","00:27:23,375",It's fine.
521,"00:27:23,458","00:27:25,083","Trust me, I got it a lot in the past."
522,"00:27:25,166","00:27:28,166","People have this picture
of me naked in the mud"
523,"00:27:28,250","00:27:30,958","and all that Woodstock stuff,
but the... the truth is the shows,"
524,"00:27:31,041","00:27:34,375","it's... it's just a group of people
who look out for each other."
525,"00:27:34,458","00:27:35,458",That's it.
526,"00:27:37,916","00:27:38,916",Everyone
527,"00:27:40,000","00:27:43,250","connected by this one love of music,"
528,"00:27:43,333","00:27:47,000","which allows them to connect,
and to relate, and to care."
529,"00:27:47,083","00:27:48,500",It's for people who
530,"00:27:48,583","00:27:51,291","haven't found that anywhere else,
weren't given that,"
531,"00:27:51,375","00:27:52,833",and had to
532,"00:27:54,208","00:27:55,666",find it for themselves.
533,"00:28:00,291","00:28:02,541","Yeah. At least for some, not everyone."
534,"00:28:07,833","00:28:09,958",I should probably walk for a bit.
535,"00:28:12,041","00:28:13,958",I'll pick up some food.
536,"00:28:14,041","00:28:16,583","Do you want anything specific,
anything in particular?"
537,"00:28:16,666","00:28:18,166","No, I'm good. Thanks."
538,"00:28:19,583","00:28:21,541",Okay. I'll see you soon.
539,"00:28:21,625","00:28:22,625",Yep.
540,"00:28:24,750","00:28:25,791",See you soon.
541,"00:28:35,541","00:28:38,083","I was given your number
from Dr. Robert Sanders' office"
542,"00:28:38,166","00:28:40,541","as a potential place
that can make a house call."
543,"00:28:41,583","00:28:44,541","Well, my father... my father is very sick."
544,"00:28:44,625","00:28:45,625",He's dying.
545,"00:28:46,625","00:28:47,791",Thanks. Yes.
546,"00:28:47,875","00:28:50,041","And he wants to sign
a do-not-resuscitate form,"
547,"00:28:50,125","00:28:51,541",but is too sick to come in.
548,"00:28:52,375","00:28:54,083","Yes, he's conscious."
549,"00:28:54,166","00:28:57,208","I mean, not all the time.
He's in hospice care here at home."
550,"00:28:57,291","00:28:59,601","- Do you think the doctor would...
- Katie? Katie?"
551,"00:28:59,625","00:29:02,250","His breathing, it's gotten really strange.
Something's happening."
552,"00:29:05,333","00:29:06,726",Daddy?
553,"00:29:06,750","00:29:08,934","- Rachel, you should come.
- Dad, can you hear me?"
554,"00:29:08,958","00:29:10,291","His breathing, something's wrong."
555,"00:29:10,375","00:29:11,500",Dad?
556,"00:29:11,583","00:29:14,583","I'm not getting it. There's no...
He's not responding. Okay. Um..."
557,"00:29:14,666","00:29:17,083","Okay, I think we should...
Um, I think we should call 911."
558,"00:29:17,166","00:29:18,642","- No.
- We should."
559,"00:29:18,666","00:29:20,875","- No. I should call Angel.
- Okay."
560,"00:29:52,958","00:29:54,642","- He's okay.
- He's okay."
561,"00:29:54,666","00:29:56,375",He's okay.
562,"00:30:06,000","00:30:07,000",Oh.
563,"00:30:12,625","00:30:15,416",Oh my fucking God.
564,"00:30:16,625","00:30:18,291","Yeah, that was crazy."
565,"00:30:18,791","00:30:19,951",I thought...
566,"00:30:20,750","00:30:23,000",I don't know.
567,"00:30:23,083","00:30:25,083","Well, I do know
that fucker's strong, damn it."
568,"00:30:25,166","00:30:27,476",Can't count him out till he's ready.
569,"00:30:27,500","00:30:29,851","- You're celebrating?
- Better believe it."
570,"00:30:29,875","00:30:33,101","I knew there was a reason why I got wine.
Didn't know it'd be for celebrating life."
571,"00:30:33,125","00:30:34,958","But, hey, I'll pour you some."
572,"00:30:35,541","00:30:39,125","Uh, just a... just a little bit.
Angel said he was gonna be here soon."
573,"00:30:39,208","00:30:41,168","We really shouldn't be partying
when he gets here."
574,"00:30:41,250","00:30:42,541",That could be a bad look.
575,"00:30:42,625","00:30:43,750",Angel.
576,"00:30:43,833","00:30:45,666",Angel of Death is more like it.
577,"00:30:46,833","00:30:48,166",Just drink it.
578,"00:30:48,666","00:30:50,375",Cheers to Dad.
579,"00:30:58,208","00:30:59,125",Oh.
580,"00:31:02,041","00:31:04,500","You got what he was saying
before, right, Angel?"
581,"00:31:05,291","00:31:08,000","Don't call him or anyone else
till Dad's good and dead."
582,"00:31:08,083","00:31:10,250","Make sure the guy's not breathing
and then some."
583,"00:31:13,541","00:31:16,541","I should go back to his room
and make sure things are steady."
584,"00:31:18,791","00:31:21,000","Angel of Death comes in
and plucks him away."
585,"00:31:23,083","00:31:24,083",Go on.
586,"00:31:26,666","00:31:29,333","Deep inside,
rolls it in with the right hand."
587,"00:31:29,416","00:31:30,976","And that play, that dr..."
588,"00:31:31,000","00:31:33,767","- Playing with...
- Don't do that. Stop doing that."
589,"00:31:33,791","00:31:35,892","No, I need to see both.
I have money on both."
590,"00:31:35,916","00:31:37,791",It doesn't matter. Just watch one.
591,"00:31:37,875","00:31:39,916",Annoying as fuck going back and forth.
592,"00:31:40,000","00:31:41,920","Pick which ever one matters more
and stick to it."
593,"00:31:41,958","00:31:44,059","I don't even know what's going on
with either of them."
594,"00:31:44,083","00:31:45,723","It's just back and forth, back and forth."
595,"00:31:46,833","00:31:47,833",Right?
596,"00:31:48,583","00:31:52,083","- Nice job by Nigel Hayes.
- Thank you."
597,"00:31:52,166","00:31:55,416","Getting extra possession.
How do you do that? Giving up your body."
598,"00:31:55,500","00:31:56,833",Gasser does it there.
599,"00:31:57,333","00:31:59,458",We have to go outside to smoke that.
600,"00:31:59,541","00:32:00,976",...go the other way.
601,"00:32:01,000","00:32:03,375",It's been requested.
602,"00:32:04,000","00:32:05,333",We're watching a game.
603,"00:32:06,500","00:32:09,750","Sorry, it's not worth it."
604,"00:32:09,833","00:32:11,625",It's no problem at all. It's my job.
605,"00:32:11,708","00:32:14,559","I'm glad you called while I was close
enough to come as quick as I could."
606,"00:32:14,583","00:32:16,708","Another 30 minutes,
I would've been headed to Queens."
607,"00:32:16,791","00:32:19,250","Well, obviously,
we're happy that he's still with us,"
608,"00:32:19,333","00:32:22,666","but about the sound he made
when his breathing got hard..."
609,"00:32:22,750","00:32:25,791","My concern, our concern,
is that he's in pain."
610,"00:32:25,875","00:32:28,250","Yes, and Mirabella should be
looking into this right now."
611,"00:32:28,333","00:32:31,500","Tolerance to the drip definitely goes up,
as does pain."
612,"00:32:31,583","00:32:34,375","For sure I suggest
we increase the morphine."
613,"00:32:34,916","00:32:37,000","It... It's just a fine line
that we must figure out."
614,"00:32:37,083","00:32:39,041","Enough to help, but not to kill."
615,"00:32:39,541","00:32:41,581","When Mirabella's ready,
she'll come out and tell us."
616,"00:32:41,625","00:32:44,583","But you see
what I was saying before, right?"
617,"00:32:44,666","00:32:45,875",We could've called 911.
618,"00:32:45,958","00:32:48,351","We would've if the breathing
continued like that for a while."
619,"00:32:48,375","00:32:50,708","It was clear he was in pain,
and we don't know what to do."
620,"00:32:50,791","00:32:53,333","I do. I did. And trust me,
the last thing anyone wants"
621,"00:32:53,416","00:32:55,000",is that in-between place.
622,"00:32:55,083","00:32:57,791","We all want him to transition
as peaceful as possible."
623,"00:32:57,875","00:32:59,115",But Mirabella should be a help.
624,"00:32:59,166","00:33:01,958","She'll tell us exactly how much more
can be administered."
625,"00:33:02,041","00:33:03,333",What if the same thing happens?
626,"00:33:03,416","00:33:05,791","He's in pain and we give him more
than what she recommends."
627,"00:33:07,083","00:33:10,833","Well, you can't intentionally do that.
That's looked upon as murder in this city,"
628,"00:33:10,916","00:33:13,083","most of this country at this time,"
629,"00:33:13,166","00:33:15,541",even if it is asked for by the patient.
630,"00:33:15,625","00:33:18,083","The only way you could do that
is to make a mistake,"
631,"00:33:18,166","00:33:20,125",for it to be unintentional.
632,"00:33:20,208","00:33:22,708","Maybe someone didn't measure
the amount correctly."
633,"00:33:22,791","00:33:25,291","Sometimes, if the amount is just over,
it can be lethal."
634,"00:33:25,375","00:33:30,083","I don't know, but mistakes have been made,
and accidents are natural, right?"
635,"00:33:30,916","00:33:33,166",I'm sorry that he was in pain.
636,"00:33:33,250","00:33:35,809","I understand how terrible
that must have been for you to witness,"
637,"00:33:35,833","00:33:40,208","but here he is with you
and not in the hospital"
638,"00:33:40,291","00:33:44,541","with hope that things will continue ahead
as peaceful as possible."
639,"00:33:45,333","00:33:46,791",Angel of motherfucking Death.
640,"00:33:46,875","00:33:48,541","Did I call it, or did I call it?"
641,"00:33:49,083","00:33:51,392","He's trying to be helpful.
You're the one who's asking him."
642,"00:33:51,416","00:33:53,833","Oh, I know, and he is.
Trust me, I appreciate it."
643,"00:33:53,916","00:33:57,625","But I'm not aiming to overdose our dad
accidentally as Angel suggested."
644,"00:33:57,708","00:33:59,166",I just don't want him to be hurting.
645,"00:33:59,250","00:34:01,541","We should figure out dinner
while the nurse is still here."
646,"00:34:01,625","00:34:03,083",Okay. You don't want to go there.
647,"00:34:03,166","00:34:04,226",That's fine.
648,"00:34:04,250","00:34:06,392","You want wine?
There's two glasses left in this bottle."
649,"00:34:06,416","00:34:08,166","- There's another if we wanna...
- I'm okay."
650,"00:34:19,291","00:34:20,291",Rachel?
651,"00:34:26,458","00:34:28,458",Yeah. Is there a problem?
652,"00:34:28,541","00:34:30,458",Is there a problem? You tell me.
653,"00:34:30,541","00:34:33,708","Look, please don't start, all right?
We smoked outside like you asked."
654,"00:34:34,250","00:34:36,208","Now we're in my room
taking care of ourselves."
655,"00:34:36,291","00:34:39,291","You don't think it's a bit weird?
I mean, it's kind of strange, no?"
656,"00:34:39,375","00:34:42,041","Having a random person over
to the house now at a time like this."
657,"00:34:42,125","00:34:45,041","Is it right to have a stranger here
when he may pass at any minute?"
658,"00:34:45,125","00:34:46,208",He's not random.
659,"00:34:46,291","00:34:48,583","Benjy and I have been hanging out
for a while now."
660,"00:34:49,208","00:34:52,166","Just 'cause you don't know him
doesn't mean he's a stranger."
661,"00:34:53,250","00:34:55,125",And Daddy likes him. That's what matters.
662,"00:34:57,416","00:34:58,416",Okay.
663,"00:35:01,458","00:35:02,458",Okay.
664,"00:35:05,750","00:35:08,125",I think you should go easier on her.
665,"00:35:08,208","00:35:09,583",All she has is easy.
666,"00:35:16,708","00:35:19,625","I mean, it was terrifying.
I was so sure he was going."
667,"00:35:19,708","00:35:22,666","His breathing sounded crazy, his face..."
668,"00:35:22,750","00:35:25,125","Man, I hope I can get that image
out of my mind."
669,"00:35:26,375","00:35:28,750","Yes, they've given him more now.
He's sleeping."
670,"00:35:28,833","00:35:30,875","I don't know if there'll be
any more windows."
671,"00:35:31,583","00:35:34,500","I'm okay. At least that means
I should be coming home soon."
672,"00:35:35,666","00:35:37,000",It's okay. It's okay.
673,"00:35:38,041","00:35:42,875","Katie started drinking a few hours ago,
and, you know, her and Rachel, it's just..."
674,"00:35:44,625","00:35:47,666","Anyways, it's okay."
675,"00:35:47,750","00:35:48,958",Everything's fine.
676,"00:35:58,125","00:36:00,958","What a story that's been.
Third straight quarterback"
677,"00:36:01,041","00:36:03,125",defending the National Championship.
678,"00:36:04,208","00:36:05,208",What?
679,"00:36:06,125","00:36:08,726","Nothing. I just... I don't need
to be dealing with your sleeping ass."
680,"00:36:08,750","00:36:12,166","- I got enough to deal with already.
- I'm feeling nice. I'm not going to sleep."
681,"00:36:13,416","00:36:16,517","- Don't put me with those bitches outside.
- Oh, come on. Those are my sisters."
682,"00:36:16,541","00:36:18,291","I can call them bitches, you can't."
683,"00:36:18,875","00:36:19,916","Yeah, sure."
684,"00:36:20,000","00:36:23,250","Those are your sisters telling you
to smoke outside. This is your home."
685,"00:36:23,333","00:36:25,125","- For real. I don't need the drama.
- Okay."
686,"00:36:25,208","00:36:26,791",Okay. Shh! Lower your voice.
687,"00:36:26,875","00:36:29,375","Okay, but you know
that's some bullshit, right?"
688,"00:36:29,458","00:36:31,684","And you know you don't need
to do the shit that they say."
689,"00:36:31,708","00:36:35,083","It's been you this whole time
in this house taking care of your dad."
690,"00:36:35,583","00:36:37,684","And suddenly, it's their place?
They've been doing it?"
691,"00:36:37,708","00:36:39,291","- Get the fuck out of here.
- Stop it."
692,"00:36:39,375","00:36:41,642","Please, quiet for me.
Like, you're just... You're yelling."
693,"00:36:41,666","00:36:43,875",All... All I'm saying is
694,"00:36:45,375","00:36:46,791",your sister lives where?
695,"00:36:47,541","00:36:48,875",Brooklyn?
696,"00:36:48,958","00:36:50,541",And she comes in when?
697,"00:36:50,625","00:36:52,500","Once a month, at best."
698,"00:36:52,583","00:36:53,625",Not even that.
699,"00:36:54,416","00:36:55,416",That is some bullshit.
700,"00:36:55,500","00:36:57,833","And you know she needs
to be called out on it too."
701,"00:36:57,916","00:37:01,333","And the other one? By looking at her,
you can tell she's not on this planet."
702,"00:37:02,625","00:37:04,583","- All right.
- Oh, I'm good at it."
703,"00:37:05,208","00:37:06,125","Yes, I'm good at it."
704,"00:37:06,208","00:37:07,458","If I could see one thing,"
705,"00:37:07,541","00:37:10,000","it's if somebody's full of shit
or out of their mind."
706,"00:37:10,791","00:37:11,958",And that ain't you.
707,"00:37:13,583","00:37:15,000",You're not either of those things.
708,"00:37:16,125","00:37:18,833","Look, they may act like they... they got it,"
709,"00:37:19,666","00:37:20,666",but they don't.
710,"00:37:21,291","00:37:22,291",Okay?
711,"00:37:25,166","00:37:26,166",You understand?
712,"00:37:29,375","00:37:30,375",I got it.
713,"00:37:33,916","00:37:35,476","""After leaving the Coast Guard,"
714,"00:37:35,500","00:37:38,250","Vincent took night classes
in business at BMCC"
715,"00:37:38,333","00:37:41,750","where he fell in love with a quiet,
green-eyed girl sitting behind him."
716,"00:37:41,833","00:37:46,375","She became Margaret Dyson in 1978,"
717,"00:37:47,125","00:37:49,541","and they became the loving parents

to breast cancer in 1994,"
719,"00:37:52,041","00:37:55,041","after a long battle
with Vincent always by her side."
720,"00:37:55,125","00:37:56,565",Three years later...
721,"00:37:59,833","00:38:02,416","Three years later,
Vincent married Sarah Brodsky,"
722,"00:38:02,500","00:38:04,666",whose young daughter he raised as his own.
723,"00:38:04,750","00:38:08,041","Sarah also preceded Vincent in death
after her own battle with..."""
724,"00:38:14,208","00:38:16,128","You know, there's enough food
for the both of you"
725,"00:38:16,166","00:38:18,166","in case you want
to tell Rachel and join us."
726,"00:38:18,250","00:38:19,333","Okay, thanks."
727,"00:38:20,083","00:38:21,458","Well, nice meeting you."
728,"00:38:40,208","00:38:42,000","Oh, we met before."
729,"00:38:43,291","00:38:44,750",It wasn't even that long ago.
730,"00:38:45,416","00:38:46,791",Maybe a few months.
731,"00:38:47,291","00:38:49,500","- You don't remember?
- I'm not sure."
732,"00:38:49,583","00:38:50,416","No, no, I don't."
733,"00:38:50,500","00:38:53,750","Um, then I guess it was
the last time you were here, maybe,"
734,"00:38:53,833","00:38:55,666","because that was a while ago, right?"
735,"00:38:57,375","00:38:59,500","Actually, it was right here,
right in this room."
736,"00:38:59,583","00:39:01,333",Me and Vinnie were watching a game.
737,"00:39:01,833","00:39:02,833",Bucks - Bulls.
738,"00:39:03,875","00:39:06,625","We did that a lot, actually.
We watched a lot of games together."
739,"00:39:06,708","00:39:08,666","- That's nice.
- It sure was."
740,"00:39:10,458","00:39:12,583",He always made me feel at home here.
741,"00:39:14,125","00:39:16,083",And I always looked forward to seeing him.
742,"00:39:16,958","00:39:20,083","Sometimes, we'd not even say anything.
We would just sit and watch."
743,"00:39:20,166","00:39:21,166",Just watch.
744,"00:39:22,875","00:39:24,083","Other times, we'd talk."
745,"00:39:24,833","00:39:25,833",Just bullshit.
746,"00:39:26,250","00:39:27,250",Talk about life.
747,"00:39:27,833","00:39:28,833",Things like that.
748,"00:39:29,583","00:39:30,958",Old people.
749,"00:39:31,041","00:39:32,041",Some are like that.
750,"00:39:32,083","00:39:35,541","I mean, not all of ‘em,
but I can usually get along with ‘em."
751,"00:39:36,125","00:39:37,833",They sometimes got this wiseness.
752,"00:39:38,666","00:39:40,458","It's just there, or it isn't."
753,"00:39:43,208","00:39:45,088","That's what I liked about Vincent
from the jump."
754,"00:39:45,125","00:39:46,684","I could tell the moment that he saw me,"
755,"00:39:46,708","00:39:49,375","he understood certain things
that I'm not gonna say,"
756,"00:39:49,458","00:39:51,541","that I don't need to say,
because I'm like that too."
757,"00:39:51,625","00:39:53,945","Sounds like you both
had a good relationship."
758,"00:39:54,000","00:39:55,250",That's great to hear.
759,"00:39:58,083","00:39:59,958","I mean, I can figure people out too."
760,"00:40:01,333","00:40:03,208",They don't even have to say anything.
761,"00:40:04,208","00:40:05,708",I can get the whole deal.
762,"00:40:06,791","00:40:08,208","Or most of it, at least."
763,"00:40:09,500","00:40:12,875","Yeah, it's easy when someone's
looking at me, but really..."
764,"00:40:14,791","00:40:15,833",looking through me.
765,"00:40:15,916","00:40:17,316",I'm not sure I'm following.
766,"00:40:17,375","00:40:18,559",If you'd rather not join us...
767,"00:40:18,583","00:40:21,166","I'm just saying
there's enough food for you both."
768,"00:40:21,250","00:40:23,000","You're welcome
to take two plates with you."
769,"00:40:23,083","00:40:24,208",You see?
770,"00:40:24,291","00:40:25,708",Now I... I get what you're doing.
771,"00:40:25,791","00:40:27,583","I mean, maybe that's obvious,"
772,"00:40:27,666","00:40:30,041","but I can see it
before you even said a word"
773,"00:40:30,125","00:40:31,365",just by walking by both of you.
774,"00:40:31,416","00:40:33,666",I think you're misunderstanding things.
775,"00:40:33,750","00:40:35,500",I'm not misunderstanding shit.
776,"00:40:36,375","00:40:38,000",Definitely not misunderstanding.
777,"00:40:39,083","00:40:40,375",Understanding.
778,"00:40:40,458","00:40:44,125","Even the act of offering food
is... is ownership."
779,"00:40:44,750","00:40:45,666",You ever think of that?
780,"00:40:45,750","00:40:49,875","I think I've sat at this table more times
than the two of you have for years."
781,"00:40:49,958","00:40:50,833",He's our father.
782,"00:40:50,916","00:40:53,333","Yes,
but who do you think has been here?"
783,"00:40:56,625","00:40:59,750","She's not...
She's not gonna stick up for herself."
784,"00:41:01,250","00:41:04,125","I mean, Rachel, she... she can...
she can handle herself,"
785,"00:41:04,208","00:41:06,168","which is one of the things
I love about that girl,"
786,"00:41:06,208","00:41:08,416",but she doesn't stick up for herself.
787,"00:41:08,500","00:41:10,708",Especially around you two. Who do you...
788,"00:41:10,791","00:41:12,911","We got it. Thank you.
Definitely heard enough."
789,"00:41:12,958","00:41:14,250","No, no, no, you did not,"
790,"00:41:14,333","00:41:17,833","because just maybe you wouldn't be acting
like you've been here all this time."
791,"00:41:19,333","00:41:21,750","Who's been taking your old man
to the bathroom?"
792,"00:41:22,958","00:41:23,958",Who's...
793,"00:41:24,583","00:41:26,833",Who's split up the... the pills
794,"00:41:26,916","00:41:29,083","in that stupid plastic container
with the days on it"
795,"00:41:29,166","00:41:31,375",just the way that I watched my mom
796,"00:41:32,083","00:41:34,375","do the same thing for her father
when he was passing?"
797,"00:41:34,458","00:41:35,791","Okay, I'm gonna call her."
798,"00:41:35,875","00:41:37,625",It's time for you to step out of our face.
799,"00:41:37,708","00:41:39,875","I can smell
whatever you've been drinking from here."
800,"00:41:39,958","00:41:41,318",Fucking poor girl fed him.
801,"00:41:42,833","00:41:44,601","When he stopped wanting
to eat anything but apples,"
802,"00:41:44,625","00:41:46,708","who was slicing them
and feeding them to him?"
803,"00:41:46,791","00:41:48,271",You don't understand a goddamn thing.
804,"00:41:48,333","00:41:50,666","Rachel, get your fucking
drunk-ass boyfriend"
805,"00:41:50,750","00:41:52,790","out of our fucking faces
or whatever the fuck he is."
806,"00:41:52,833","00:41:54,353",I don't want him here. He needs to go.
807,"00:41:54,416","00:41:56,625","Come on, Benjy.
Let's get the fuck out of here."
808,"00:41:58,875","00:42:02,083","I want to say bye to Vincent.
Is that okay? Can I say goodbye?"
809,"00:42:02,666","00:42:04,208","Sure, of course."
810,"00:42:04,291","00:42:05,625",Are you coming in with me?
811,"00:42:06,291","00:42:07,750",I'm gonna stay out here.
812,"00:43:10,125","00:43:11,416",Oh boy.
813,"00:43:19,083","00:43:21,416",Thank you. Thank you very much.
814,"00:43:22,083","00:43:25,541","It's been so helpful having you come
and watch over these hours each day."
815,"00:43:25,625","00:43:27,541","It gives us a moment
to be out of the room."
816,"00:43:27,625","00:43:29,250","Just catch our breath, you know?"
817,"00:43:29,791","00:43:32,458","Sometimes, it gets a bit much,
all packed in together."
818,"00:43:32,541","00:43:34,166",I... I'm sorry about earlier.
819,"00:43:35,166","00:43:37,833","Things became stressful.
I guess you've seen it all."
820,"00:43:37,916","00:43:38,958",That's no problem.
821,"00:43:39,041","00:43:40,250","So, tomorrow 5:00 p.m.?"
822,"00:43:40,333","00:43:42,833","Yes, um,
unless something happens before then."
823,"00:43:42,916","00:43:43,958",I'll call if so.
824,"00:43:44,458","00:43:46,166",It feels like... I don't know.
825,"00:43:47,208","00:43:50,875","We'll see what tomorrow is like,
but I... I don't know how much longer."
826,"00:43:50,958","00:43:53,416","He's, um... He's not doing well."
827,"00:43:55,291","00:43:56,166",I'm sorry.
828,"00:43:56,250","00:43:58,208",I'm sorry. I know you have to leave.
829,"00:43:58,291","00:44:00,458","Um, really, thank you for today."
830,"00:44:00,541","00:44:02,708","We'll see you tomorrow,
I'm sure."

837,"00:45:28,541","00:45:30,684","- Can I say something? Wait one minute.
- Not interested."
838,"00:45:30,708","00:45:33,000","- I haven't said...
- I'm not interested."
839,"00:45:33,083","00:45:35,642","- Well, I'm trying to say...
- Okay, here's the thing, all right?"
840,"00:45:35,666","00:45:38,506","We don't have to say anything
to each other. There's nothing to be said."
841,"00:45:38,583","00:45:41,101","Just do what you have to do
while you're here. After, that's it."
842,"00:45:41,125","00:45:44,333","We'll have nothing to do with each other.
We can stay out of each other's way."
843,"00:45:44,416","00:45:46,559","That's not practical,
nor is that what's right."

845,"00:45:48,291","00:45:50,291","It's not about either of us.
It's about our father."
846,"00:45:50,375","00:45:51,934","- Oh, ""our father."" That's funny.
- Why?"
847,"00:45:51,958","00:45:55,541","You always call him ""our father""
when you want something from me."
848,"00:45:55,625","00:45:57,333","Usually, you say, ""My father."""
849,"00:45:57,416","00:45:59,458","- Don't be ridiculous.
- What's going on here?"
850,"00:45:59,541","00:46:02,375","Well, I'm trying to apologize to her,
but as you can see..."
851,"00:46:02,458","00:46:04,875","Fuck your apology, for real."
852,"00:46:06,541","00:46:07,375",Nice.
853,"00:46:07,458","00:46:09,418","Nice. You slam the door
when he's dying next door?"
854,"00:46:09,458","00:46:11,083",You're a fucking spoiled bitch!
855,"00:46:11,791","00:46:13,271",What the fuck are you doing?
856,"00:46:13,333","00:46:15,791","- No! No!
- What are you doing?"
857,"00:46:15,875","00:46:18,250","No, you have no idea.
I will fucking destroy you!"
858,"00:46:18,333","00:46:20,017","- You'll destroy me?
- Yes!"
859,"00:46:20,041","00:46:23,208","You're a fucking punk, that's it!
You're a leeching, broke-ass..."
860,"00:46:23,291","00:46:26,041","All right, Christina, you need
to get this bitch out of here."
861,"00:46:26,125","00:46:29,375","- Bring it on!
- Stop it!"
862,"00:46:29,458","00:46:30,583",Stop it!
863,"00:46:31,250","00:46:35,166","I hate you both! You're both assholes!
You're little fucking kids!"
864,"00:46:37,458","00:46:40,583","Christina, where are you going?"
865,"00:47:01,583","00:47:02,583",Hey.
866,"00:47:03,250","00:47:05,750","I just left his room to pack.
He's doing okay."
867,"00:47:05,833","00:47:07,041",Why did you pack?
868,"00:47:07,125","00:47:08,958","I think
I should head home for a bit."
869,"00:47:10,458","00:47:11,500","Uh, it's late."
870,"00:47:11,583","00:47:13,208",I think it would do good if I leave.
871,"00:47:13,291","00:47:15,666","If something changes,
just let me know, and I'll come back."
872,"00:47:15,750","00:47:17,750","Something is going to change.
You know that."
873,"00:47:17,833","00:47:19,041",Christina...
874,"00:47:19,125","00:47:20,565",...I don't know what you want of me.
875,"00:47:20,625","00:47:22,750","Clearly, there's an issue
with the three of us."
876,"00:47:22,833","00:47:24,583",I didn't even know it was between us.
877,"00:47:24,666","00:47:26,833","Regardless, she lives here,
and you live far away."
878,"00:47:26,916","00:47:28,676","Makes sense for me
to be the one to step out."
879,"00:47:28,750","00:47:32,291","I'm sorry, he's going to die,
and you will not be here,"
880,"00:47:32,375","00:47:33,583",and you'll never forgive me.
881,"00:47:33,666","00:47:35,375",I'm sorry. I don't want you to leave.
882,"00:47:35,458","00:47:38,500","I want the three of us
to figure something out,"
883,"00:47:38,583","00:47:42,833","some way that we can do what we can
to get along, at least for now."
884,"00:47:42,916","00:47:44,250",I thought we were just fine...
885,"00:47:44,333","00:47:45,875",...you and I.
886,"00:47:45,958","00:47:47,375",That was a surprise.
887,"00:47:48,083","00:47:49,875","Katie, I was mad."
888,"00:47:50,541","00:47:51,958",I got angry.
889,"00:47:52,041","00:47:53,875","Allow me to say things, okay?"
890,"00:47:53,958","00:47:55,041",I was scared.
891,"00:47:57,375","00:47:58,666","Hey, let's sit down."
892,"00:47:59,375","00:48:00,541",All three of us.
893,"00:48:01,416","00:48:03,500",We can leave his door open.
894,"00:48:03,583","00:48:05,666",We hear if something's happening.
895,"00:48:06,250","00:48:07,250",I don't know.
896,"00:48:08,208","00:48:10,708","You know he's gonna die
while we're talking."
897,"00:48:10,791","00:48:13,083","Mmm, no, I don't think so."
898,"00:48:14,041","00:48:16,666","Especially if he can hear
that we're all talking together."
899,"00:48:37,541","00:48:39,101",I don't think she's gonna join.
900,"00:48:52,083","00:48:53,416","- Hey.
- Hey."
901,"00:48:55,625","00:48:58,666","Katie's been working
on Dad's obituary."
902,"00:49:00,458","00:49:01,333",Okay.
903,"00:49:01,416","00:49:03,750","She was reading it
to me earlier,"
904,"00:49:03,833","00:49:05,875",and hearing what she wrote
905,"00:49:05,958","00:49:09,750","made me think we each
have very different stories."
906,"00:49:10,625","00:49:14,583","Who he is, who he was to each of us."
907,"00:49:14,666","00:49:17,625","We were all raised by him,
but at different times."
908,"00:49:17,708","00:49:20,958","We had different lives,
even if it was in the same home."
909,"00:49:21,041","00:49:23,250","Both of you had moved out
before I was even a teenager."
910,"00:49:23,333","00:49:26,750","So it... it makes sense
that we are different."
911,"00:49:26,833","00:49:29,833",I am sorry for what I said earlier.
912,"00:49:30,500","00:49:32,583",I do not hate either of you.
913,"00:49:32,666","00:49:34,875",I do not think you are both assholes.
914,"00:49:35,500","00:49:36,666","I was mad,"
915,"00:49:37,458","00:49:38,333",I was scared.
916,"00:49:38,416","00:49:40,541","It was everything
I did not want to happen."
917,"00:49:41,125","00:49:42,125",I apologize.
918,"00:49:43,083","00:49:44,166","Sure, whatever."
919,"00:49:44,958","00:49:46,375",That wasn't the problem.
920,"00:49:47,916","00:49:50,583","I mean, it's all good."
921,"00:49:50,666","00:49:51,750",Uh...
922,"00:49:51,833","00:49:55,041","No need to apologize,
but apology accepted."
923,"00:49:55,125","00:49:58,541","Yeah, it's fine, Christina.
Apology accepted, of course."
924,"00:49:59,208","00:50:01,625","I apologize you got caught
between things."
925,"00:50:07,416","00:50:08,250",Well...
926,"00:50:08,333","00:50:11,458","I was trying to say sorry too earlier
before things went out of hand."
927,"00:50:11,541","00:50:12,666",Sorry for what?
928,"00:50:12,750","00:50:16,125","Well, for one thing criticizing you
about the apples being in there."
929,"00:50:16,208","00:50:18,476","I hadn't known they were for Dad.
I'm sorry. I wish I did."
930,"00:50:18,500","00:50:20,291",And that makes all the difference?
931,"00:50:20,375","00:50:22,416",The apples
932,"00:50:23,375","00:50:24,708",tell you all you need to know.
933,"00:50:24,791","00:50:27,833","It was one thing.
It was a thing I assumed incorrectly."
934,"00:50:27,916","00:50:29,083",Anything else?
935,"00:50:30,625","00:50:31,625",Sure.
936,"00:50:34,791","00:50:37,416","From the beginning,
I have understood I was in your place."
937,"00:50:37,500","00:50:39,375",Bullshit. It's your place too.
938,"00:50:39,458","00:50:40,708",I know it. You know it...
939,"00:50:40,791","00:50:42,958","But you live here.
You are on the lease."
940,"00:50:43,041","00:50:44,476","That's the second time
you mentioned this lease."
941,"00:50:44,500","00:50:46,458","What is that?
What... What are you trying to say?"
942,"00:50:46,541","00:50:48,708",And you brought it up too. Outside.
943,"00:50:48,791","00:50:50,416","So, what's up with this?"
944,"00:50:50,500","00:50:53,375","Nothing. Just the fact that when he dies,
this becomes your place."
945,"00:50:53,458","00:50:55,767","You think that's what I want?
That I give a shit about the place?"
946,"00:50:55,791","00:50:56,916",Sorry. Let's...
947,"00:50:57,000","00:51:00,750","Let's just keep our voices down.
We need to be able to hear his room."
948,"00:51:01,625","00:51:04,833","Okay? I don't think either of us
are trying to imply"
949,"00:51:04,916","00:51:06,958",anything other than what's understood.
950,"00:51:07,041","00:51:07,916",Understood?
951,"00:51:08,000","00:51:10,375","Come on, Rachel.
Of course you care about him."
952,"00:51:10,458","00:51:12,333",But this place is a good deal.
953,"00:51:12,416","00:51:13,666",Let's be truthful about it.
954,"00:51:13,750","00:51:15,500",Nobody has rent like this in the city.
955,"00:51:15,583","00:51:17,333","I mean, just about. It doesn't exist."
956,"00:51:17,416","00:51:18,416",This is good.
957,"00:51:18,500","00:51:21,059","- I'm happy for you. I want you to have it.
- Well, then fuck it."
958,"00:51:21,083","00:51:22,083",I don't want it.
959,"00:51:22,791","00:51:23,791",Now what?
960,"00:51:23,875","00:51:25,666","Don't be silly.
Why would you leave?"
961,"00:51:25,750","00:51:28,916","'Cause then we're done with each other,
and this shit's a wrap."
962,"00:51:29,000","00:51:30,458",This doesn't make any sense.
963,"00:51:30,541","00:51:32,341","Christina, can you explain
what this is about?"
964,"00:51:32,375","00:51:34,125","- I'm not sure.
- Don't play fucking dumb."
965,"00:51:34,208","00:51:35,958","- Fuck you.
- Oh, okay."
966,"00:51:36,041","00:51:38,041","Hey, everyone, stop."
967,"00:51:56,583","00:51:57,666",Everything's okay.
968,"00:52:03,875","00:52:04,875",I think
969,"00:52:06,125","00:52:07,666",what Rachel is asking
970,"00:52:08,791","00:52:10,833",is what connects us after he's gone?
971,"00:52:12,208","00:52:14,500",Not us.
972,"00:52:14,583","00:52:17,500","I mean, you two is clear, right?"
973,"00:52:18,125","00:52:20,791","And I... I get it with you, Christina."
974,"00:52:20,875","00:52:22,916",You live thousands of miles away.
975,"00:52:23,000","00:52:24,083",You got your kid.
976,"00:52:24,166","00:52:25,958",Probably gonna pop out a bunch more.
977,"00:52:26,041","00:52:28,976","Uh, you got your life, you know?
This city ain't your thing. I... I get it."
978,"00:52:29,000","00:52:31,040","So you only care about
your relationship with Katie?"
979,"00:52:31,083","00:52:31,916","Oh, fuck no."
980,"00:52:32,000","00:52:34,708","No, you at least act like
we have something more in common."
981,"00:52:34,791","00:52:36,708",See? This is what I was trying to say.
982,"00:52:36,791","00:52:40,583","We each have our own stories,
but we don't know the other's."
983,"00:52:40,666","00:52:41,958",We assume we do.
984,"00:52:42,041","00:52:44,583",But maybe you just... Well...
985,"00:52:44,666","00:52:48,166","Maybe before I pop out some more kids,
which is fucking disgusting by the way."
986,"00:52:48,250","00:52:49,500","- It's true.
- No, nothing pops."
987,"00:52:49,583","00:52:51,458","There's no popping.
That's not the way it is."
988,"00:52:51,541","00:52:52,916",Okay. It looks like popping to me.
989,"00:52:53,500","00:52:55,875","Okay, well, before I choose
to grow my family,"
990,"00:52:55,958","00:52:58,250",if I choose to...
991,"00:52:58,333","00:53:01,166",...there are things I was hoping to do.
992,"00:53:01,250","00:53:02,250","Oh, like what?"
993,"00:53:02,333","00:53:04,416","I mean, what could
you possibly need to do?"
994,"00:53:04,500","00:53:06,833","Like, your life is perfect."
995,"00:53:06,916","00:53:10,166","I mean, I know it, everyone knows it.
You let everyone know."
996,"00:53:10,250","00:53:11,250",Is that what you think?
997,"00:53:11,333","00:53:15,125","Is that what you think I'm saying
when I show you pictures of Mirabella"
998,"00:53:15,208","00:53:16,666",or talk about my life?
999,"00:53:21,083","00:53:22,083",Katie?
1000,"00:53:23,125","00:53:25,208",Is that what it comes off as to you?
1001,"00:53:27,583","00:53:30,125","Well, damn it."
1002,"00:53:30,208","00:53:31,583","For real, damn it."
1003,"00:53:31,666","00:53:35,625","That's not at all what I meant.
That... That's not what..."
1004,"00:53:35,708","00:53:37,833",Wait. I... I... I'm sorry. I...
1005,"00:53:38,333","00:53:41,416","I really didn't mean to say anything
to hurt you, okay? I, uh..."
1006,"00:53:42,791","00:53:44,583",I guess I thought it was kind of obvious.
1007,"00:53:44,666","00:53:47,375","Like, I never hear you complain
about anything."
1008,"00:53:47,458","00:53:50,625","I guess, ""Mirabella won't eat
her green vegetables,"" or something."
1009,"00:53:50,708","00:53:53,000","I mean, hey, that's just me."
1010,"00:53:53,083","00:53:55,083","Like, just forget what I said."
1011,"00:53:57,125","00:54:00,791","What was it you were hoping to do
before having more kids?"
1012,"00:54:05,208","00:54:10,500","I was hoping to form a relationship
with you for one thing."
1013,"00:54:14,500","00:54:15,500",Ah.
1014,"00:54:18,291","00:54:19,708","That's sweet, Christina."
1015,"00:54:22,000","00:54:23,000",That is.
1016,"00:54:25,041","00:54:27,916",I thought we had a relationship.
1017,"00:54:28,416","00:54:30,958","- No, a real one.
- It is what it is."
1018,"00:54:33,375","00:54:34,375",Look...
1019,"00:54:36,958","00:54:38,166",Let's just forget it.
1020,"00:54:39,375","00:54:41,375","You know, we're different types of people."
1021,"00:54:41,458","00:54:44,541","You... You two, at least,
you know, you share blood,"
1022,"00:54:45,416","00:54:46,500",you have the same mother.
1023,"00:54:46,583","00:54:48,416","- And father.
- Well, duh."
1024,"00:54:49,083","00:54:50,083",I know that.
1025,"00:54:50,833","00:54:53,875","Okay? But he's my dad too,
is what I'm saying."
1026,"00:54:53,958","00:54:56,833","You know, he's my dad too,
just as much as he is both of yours."
1027,"00:54:56,916","00:55:00,458","- But you also had another dad.
- Who I never fucking knew."
1028,"00:55:00,541","00:55:03,291","Who died when
I was four fucking years old."
1029,"00:55:03,375","00:55:06,500","But he was still your father.
And when he was, Vincent was ours."
1030,"00:55:08,708","00:55:09,916",Here it is.
1031,"00:55:10,958","00:55:13,291",This is what this is all about.
1032,"00:55:17,250","00:55:20,000",I did not have a father
1033,"00:55:21,166","00:55:22,250",before him.
1034,"00:55:23,208","00:55:24,208",Right?
1035,"00:55:25,333","00:55:27,333",What part of that don't you understand?
1036,"00:55:28,916","00:55:31,583",He's been Daddy to me.
1037,"00:55:32,166","00:55:36,875",So that's my dad over there...
1038,"00:55:38,250","00:55:39,250",in here...
1039,"00:55:40,333","00:55:41,708",fucking dying.
1040,"00:55:41,791","00:55:42,791",You know?
1041,"00:55:43,916","00:55:45,958",It's my dad.
1042,"00:55:46,916","00:55:49,791","That is my dad, okay?"
1043,"00:55:50,625","00:55:53,375","I know. I know.
I'm not saying he's not. I'm just..."
1044,"00:55:53,458","00:55:54,458",Shh!
1045,"00:56:18,625","00:56:22,291","You know, just because I don't complain
doesn't mean I don't have issues."
1046,"00:56:28,041","00:56:30,625",I've been here for him.
1047,"00:56:32,125","00:56:33,791",Not this stupid place.
1048,"00:56:39,333","00:56:40,583",Oh my God.
1049,"00:57:28,083","00:57:30,166","I think I actually found
someone to come over,"
1050,"00:57:30,250","00:57:31,666","a doctor, to get that form signed."
1051,"00:57:31,750","00:57:32,750",That's good.
1052,"00:57:32,833","00:57:35,791","- I'm sorry, you're stretching.
- No, it's fine. I'm just finishing."
1053,"00:57:36,708","00:57:37,833",You want some coffee?
1054,"00:57:37,916","00:57:38,916",Sure.
1055,"00:57:55,333","00:57:58,583","The thing is getting Dad to appear with it
when the doctor's here."
1056,"00:57:59,083","00:58:00,791","Yeah, that may be tricky."
1057,"00:58:00,875","00:58:02,715","He really didn't say anything
to me last night."
1058,"00:58:02,791","00:58:05,250","He mumbled a few times,
but nothing I understood."
1059,"00:58:05,333","00:58:06,333",Same.
1060,"00:58:06,833","00:58:08,433",You think it's wrong to give him coffee?
1061,"00:58:09,291","00:58:10,333","Okay, maybe not."
1062,"00:58:10,416","00:58:12,833","We just need one more window
of clarity. That's it."
1063,"00:58:12,916","00:58:14,333",I know he has it in him.
1064,"00:58:14,416","00:58:16,056",The coffee's good. Thank you.
1065,"00:58:19,958","00:58:22,166","I'm sorry about last night.
It got out of hand."
1066,"00:58:23,875","00:58:24,875",Me too.
1067,"00:58:30,125","00:58:36,000","There's something I... I realized yesterday
after we all spoke together."
1068,"00:58:36,083","00:58:37,083",It's silly.
1069,"00:58:37,125","00:58:40,375","I should've realized it years ago,
but didn't for whatever reason."
1070,"00:58:41,083","00:58:42,833","That her mother died, and so did ours."
1071,"00:58:44,666","00:58:47,458","It's just something else
we have in common besides Dad."
1072,"00:58:47,541","00:58:49,750","We never talked about it
when it happened to her."
1073,"00:58:49,833","00:58:50,958",You were young.
1074,"00:58:51,500","00:58:52,791",Yeah. We all were.
1075,"00:58:53,500","00:58:56,666","Probably too young
to talk about it in any real way."
1076,"00:59:22,166","00:59:23,250",The doctor's here.
1077,"00:59:23,750","00:59:27,541","- Can you get...
- ...while I...?"
1078,"00:59:29,458","00:59:31,166","You want some coffee?
Just made some."
1079,"00:59:31,250","00:59:33,458",We have water and juice as well.
1080,"00:59:33,541","00:59:35,541",He's just right back here.
1081,"00:59:35,625","00:59:39,291","Um, the nurse isn't coming till three,
but hopefully, we can get him up."
1082,"00:59:39,375","00:59:41,083","Dad? Dad, how are you doing?"
1083,"00:59:41,166","00:59:43,125","I'm Christina.
This is our father."
1084,"00:59:43,208","00:59:44,976","Let's, um...
Let's pull the lever, so..."
1085,"00:59:45,000","00:59:47,500","Let's pop... Hit the button
to sit him up a little bit. Yeah."
1086,"00:59:47,583","00:59:49,500","He's kinda off.
He was just resting."
1087,"00:59:49,583","00:59:50,708",He was saying a few words.
1088,"00:59:59,041","01:00:00,083",Here we go.
1089,"01:00:01,333","01:00:02,973","- Okay. Great.
- Yeah."
1090,"01:00:03,375","01:00:04,625","Um, I guess we just..."
1091,"01:00:05,416","01:00:07,500","I wish you could've
seen him, huh?"
1092,"01:00:08,416","01:00:11,000","Couple of months ago,
when he was still up and about."
1093,"01:00:11,083","01:00:12,683",That was nothing to get worked up about.
1094,"01:00:12,750","01:00:14,333",He basically just needed a pulse.
1095,"01:00:14,416","01:00:16,958","$550, in and out, 10 minutes."
1096,"01:00:17,041","01:00:20,000","Must be a nice life.
But, yeah, at least it's done."
1097,"01:00:21,583","01:00:24,458","Well, tell her she has to.
This is not something up for debate."
1098,"01:00:25,833","01:00:28,458","This can't be this thing
where I'm the bad person,"
1099,"01:00:28,541","01:00:29,833",I'm the mean mother.
1100,"01:00:30,375","01:00:32,083",Things are hard enough here.
1101,"01:00:32,166","01:00:33,916",I'm like that here. I don't get it.
1102,"01:00:34,000","01:00:37,500","I don't understand how I became
that person to everyone. It's not fair."
1103,"01:00:37,583","01:00:40,708","That's not who I am.
No one gives me space to be anything else."
1104,"01:00:45,041","01:00:46,583","Nothing, forget it."
1105,"01:00:46,666","01:00:47,708",Okay.
1106,"01:00:47,791","01:00:50,750","Let Tracey do whatever she wants.
It's out of my hands."
1107,"01:00:51,416","01:00:52,458",Let's talk later.
1108,"01:00:58,500","01:01:00,916","Oh, you're just
a good little baby boy."
1109,"01:01:01,000","01:01:02,875","A big boy, huh?"
1110,"01:01:02,958","01:01:05,791",Slobbering around like a little big boy.
1111,"01:01:06,291","01:01:07,208",God.
1112,"01:01:07,291","01:01:09,333","This is a good dog, huh?"
1113,"01:01:09,416","01:01:12,125","Does this dog... Eats like a horse, I bet."
1114,"01:01:23,875","01:01:24,875",Hello.
1115,"01:01:27,208","01:01:28,208",Ah.
1116,"01:01:28,666","01:01:30,666","Yeah, that's right. You got it."
1117,"01:01:31,375","01:01:33,095","You guys should open earlier.
You know that?"
1118,"01:01:33,166","01:01:35,083",What is this 10:00 a.m. bullshit?
1119,"01:01:35,166","01:01:37,500","That's why this neighborhood
is going to shit. Yeah."
1120,"01:01:37,583","01:01:40,625","I should open up my own bong store.
Twenty-four hours, no bullshit."
1121,"01:01:40,708","01:01:43,291","Just take your shit,
and get the fuck out of here, you know?"
1122,"01:01:43,375","01:01:45,916","Yeah. Fucking wholesale, huh?"
1123,"01:01:46,000","01:01:47,333","All right, man."
1124,"01:01:47,416","01:01:50,250","I'm not really gonna open it,
so don't worry about that."
1125,"01:01:53,750","01:01:54,750",Morning.
1126,"01:01:58,208","01:01:59,375","Oh, hello."
1127,"01:01:59,458","01:02:00,458",How you doing?
1128,"01:02:01,791","01:02:02,791","Uh,"
1129,"01:02:03,541","01:02:04,541",can't complain.
1130,"01:02:05,458","01:02:07,083",That's good. That's good.
1131,"01:02:07,625","01:02:09,666",Just came out from seeing your father.
1132,"01:02:09,750","01:02:12,000","You were able to get
that DNR form signed, I see."
1133,"01:02:12,083","01:02:12,958",Yes.
1134,"01:02:13,041","01:02:14,708","Yes, a doctor came this morning."
1135,"01:02:14,791","01:02:18,625","And he was able to sign it?
I mean, he was aware of what's going on?"
1136,"01:02:18,708","01:02:19,541",Yes.
1137,"01:02:19,625","01:02:21,083",That's a surprise.
1138,"01:02:21,166","01:02:22,166","I mean, it's good."
1139,"01:02:23,708","01:02:26,166","What I was just about
to tell your sisters is..."
1140,"01:02:26,833","01:02:28,125","I know this is hard to hear,"
1141,"01:02:28,750","01:02:32,708","but I would be very surprised
if your father is conscious again."
1142,"01:02:33,291","01:02:35,791","Thankfully, he appears to be comfortable."
1143,"01:02:36,666","01:02:38,166","In terms of what happens after,"
1144,"01:02:38,250","01:02:41,333","both Mirabella and I will be here
as soon as we possibly can"
1145,"01:02:41,416","01:02:43,416",and handle as much as we can.
1146,"01:02:43,500","01:02:46,791","But there are certain things
that we won't be able to answer, though."
1147,"01:02:46,875","01:02:49,125","Exactly when you realize he's passed,"
1148,"01:02:49,208","01:02:52,375","if you could try to note it,
then, of course, you know,"
1149,"01:02:52,458","01:02:55,333","this doesn't have to be to the second.
We understand that."
1150,"01:02:55,958","01:02:58,791","Pick a minute in the timeframe
when you are able."
1151,"01:02:59,750","01:03:03,666","Maybe try to decide between you all
who will do what,"
1152,"01:03:03,750","01:03:06,125","who will make calls, who will document."
1153,"01:03:07,666","01:03:09,166",You will need each other.
1154,"01:03:09,750","01:03:11,666",It's good that there are three of you.
1155,"01:03:11,750","01:03:14,916",It feels like you're saying this is it.
1156,"01:03:16,833","01:03:18,791","Like, we are here now."
1157,"01:03:19,583","01:03:20,750",At the end.
1158,"01:03:22,125","01:03:24,750","Yeah, but wasn't it yesterday?"
1159,"01:03:25,416","01:03:29,666","Like, no offense, but we know he's dying.
Like, we get it."
1160,"01:03:29,750","01:03:31,125","You say you can't say when,"
1161,"01:03:31,208","01:03:36,000","but then you come here and say,
""This is it,"" every day."
1162,"01:03:36,083","01:03:38,583","I don't want to speak for them,"
1163,"01:03:38,666","01:03:41,125","but it is... It's wearing on me, you know?"
1164,"01:03:41,208","01:03:44,333","It's a lot.
There's been a lot of time to say goodbye."
1165,"01:03:44,416","01:03:46,096","Yeah, I mean, it was definitely yesterday."
1166,"01:03:46,125","01:03:47,458","- And today.
- Yeah."
1167,"01:03:47,541","01:03:49,875","I'm sorry
if I've come off as alarmist."
1168,"01:03:49,958","01:03:52,000",That is definitely not my intention.
1169,"01:03:52,791","01:03:55,416",It's just that things have been ending.
1170,"01:03:55,958","01:03:57,750","- That's why I'm here.
- We know."
1171,"01:03:58,625","01:04:02,125","And you've been great.
Trust me, we are grateful."
1172,"01:04:02,833","01:04:04,375",It was a late night.
1173,"01:04:05,083","01:04:06,166",I couldn't help it.
1174,"01:04:06,250","01:04:08,916","The dude's here every day
saying he's gonna die."
1175,"01:04:09,000","01:04:11,625","It's bad enough as it is,
but he's dramatic as fuck."
1176,"01:04:11,708","01:04:12,708",I know. I know.
1177,"01:04:12,791","01:04:15,666","""Uh, good morning. Your dad is gonna die."""
1178,"01:04:15,750","01:04:18,083","""May I have some coffee?"""
1179,"01:04:18,166","01:04:20,166",What's wrong with you two?
1180,"01:04:20,250","01:04:22,875","I'm sorry. I should...
I should keep my mouth closed."
1181,"01:04:22,958","01:04:25,500","No, you're right.
He should switch it up just for a bit,"
1182,"01:04:25,583","01:04:30,375","say he should be juggling soon
just to see if we're listening."
1183,"01:04:30,458","01:04:31,458",Juggling?
1184,"01:04:32,250","01:04:34,041","Yeah, something random. Anything."
1185,"01:04:34,125","01:04:36,791","Uh, juggling? Why juggling?
Dad doesn't know how to juggle."
1186,"01:04:36,875","01:04:38,684","He could do that thing
where the quarter disappears."
1187,"01:04:38,708","01:04:39,625",Oh yeah!
1188,"01:04:39,708","01:04:40,708",Okay. Well...
1189,"01:04:40,791","01:04:42,166","Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah."
1190,"01:04:43,000","01:04:47,875","""Your dad should be disappearing
a quarter anytime soon."""
1191,"01:04:47,958","01:04:50,666","Yeah, I like that.
That... That makes sense to me."
1192,"01:04:50,750","01:04:52,375","You're stoned. But, yeah, I agree."
1193,"01:04:52,458","01:04:54,041",Are you gonna go in there?
1194,"01:04:56,375","01:04:58,916","If you want. I'm not pushing you,
but... but if you"
1195,"01:04:59,708","01:05:03,125","want to be there with us or without us,
I hope you'll say."
1196,"01:05:07,083","01:05:08,750","Okay, well, I'm gonna go in there."
1197,"01:05:08,833","01:05:11,208","I'll call if anything happens,"
1198,"01:05:11,708","01:05:13,583",if a quarter begins to disappear.
1199,"01:05:22,250","01:05:25,541","I'm not planning on our relationship
just ending after he's gone."
1200,"01:05:28,958","01:05:30,333",What relationship is that?
1201,"01:05:30,416","01:05:32,375","Well, what do you want it to be?"
1202,"01:05:46,291","01:05:48,125","No, you pick up the phone."
1203,"01:05:48,208","01:05:49,208",Tracey!
1204,"01:05:51,416","01:05:55,083","...works so much.
Jimmie Hunt tackled by Tim Bennett."
1205,"01:05:55,166","01:05:56,625",This is what happens.
1206,"01:05:57,250","01:05:59,166",Bennett recovering a fumble.
1207,"01:06:00,458","01:06:02,178","I don't care
that you were at lunch."
1208,"01:06:02,208","01:06:04,226",...extremely physical corner has no...
1209,"01:06:04,250","01:06:05,250",Tracey?
1210,"01:06:05,791","01:06:07,767","...those are the kind of corners
that I like to see,"
1211,"01:06:07,791","01:06:11,750","ones that have no problem coming up
and making a hit in the backfield..."
1212,"01:06:12,208","01:06:13,208",I can't.
1213,"01:06:14,041","01:06:15,125",Tracey?
1214,"01:06:16,333","01:06:18,750",...these defensive backs...
1215,"01:06:19,875","01:06:21,125","Tracey, listen to me."
1216,"01:06:21,625","01:06:23,500",I need you to stop and hear me.
1217,"01:06:24,250","01:06:25,958",Do not do that.
1218,"01:06:26,041","01:06:28,333","Tracey, I'm asking you to not..."
1219,"01:06:28,416","01:06:31,291",Tracey!
1220,"01:06:39,875","01:06:41,750",Are you sure you don't want half at least?
1221,"01:06:41,833","01:06:43,353","No, I'm really not hungry."
1222,"01:06:48,166","01:06:50,041","I know it's weird, but it says to do that."
1223,"01:06:50,125","01:06:51,166","Yeah, it's fine."
1224,"01:06:52,166","01:06:53,846",Really? I can't make you anything?
1225,"01:06:53,875","01:06:56,000","- I'm hungry all the time here.
- Really?"
1226,"01:06:56,500","01:06:58,340","Want a break?
I can sit with him if you'd like."
1227,"01:06:58,375","01:07:01,125","I'm fine. Do you want
to be in there with him?"
1228,"01:07:01,208","01:07:05,166","‘Cause we can be in there together.
It's fine. I'm just... I'm reading to him."
1229,"01:07:05,250","01:07:07,250","No, it's fine. There's things I can do."
1230,"01:07:15,541","01:07:16,916",Do you know where Rachel went to?
1231,"01:07:17,500","01:07:18,500",Mm-mm.
1232,"01:07:50,458","01:07:51,541",Christina?
1233,"01:07:55,333","01:07:56,333",Christina?
1234,"01:07:58,250","01:07:59,250",Hey.
1235,"01:08:04,333","01:08:05,166",Oh.
1236,"01:08:05,250","01:08:07,166","- Oh, you're over there.
- Yeah."
1237,"01:08:08,708","01:08:10,333",I was just taking a moment. What's up?
1238,"01:08:10,416","01:08:13,041","Nothing. Take the moment.
Everything is fine."
1239,"01:08:38,916","01:08:41,291","- He's gone?
- No."
1240,"01:08:41,875","01:08:44,041","No, we would've called
if something like that happened."
1241,"01:08:46,041","01:08:47,041",I don't know.
1242,"01:08:48,208","01:08:49,958","It's just weird, you sitting there."
1243,"01:08:52,875","01:08:54,958","- Katie made food if you want.
- Yeah."
1244,"01:08:57,041","01:08:58,916",Shit feels pretty weird in here.
1245,"01:08:59,000","01:09:02,958","I'm just taking a moment
before going back to Dad."
1246,"01:09:04,375","01:09:05,375",Okay.
1247,"01:09:06,791","01:09:07,791",Yeah.
1248,"01:09:08,708","01:09:11,041","I should go check scores.
I have a 16 parlay going."
1249,"01:09:11,125","01:09:13,583","Uh, shit ain't gonna hit, but..."
1250,"01:09:14,666","01:09:15,666",who knows.
1251,"01:09:28,958","01:09:29,958",Are you okay?
1252,"01:09:30,750","01:09:32,000",I'm fine.
1253,"01:09:35,333","01:09:36,333",Okay.
1254,"01:09:44,333","01:09:45,875","Here. Here, take this."
1255,"01:09:47,250","01:09:48,250",Thank you.
1256,"01:09:49,916","01:09:51,833","Yeah, no worries."
1257,"01:10:30,666","01:10:31,666","Hey, Pop."
1258,"01:10:32,208","01:10:34,416","Uh, we got, uh..."
1259,"01:10:35,458","01:10:37,375","the Clippers at +125,"
1260,"01:10:37,916","01:10:39,208","Bills -200,"
1261,"01:10:39,291","01:10:41,291","Titans -145,"
1262,"01:10:41,375","01:10:42,791","Vikings -900,"
1263,"01:10:43,291","01:10:44,708","Mets -115,"
1264,"01:10:44,791","01:10:47,583","and, uh, Eagles -220."
1265,"01:10:47,666","01:10:48,666",So...
1266,"01:10:49,666","01:10:52,291",20 bucks to make 724 and some change.
1267,"01:10:53,000","01:10:55,291","It's crazy, right?"
1268,"01:11:07,166","01:11:08,166",Yeah.
1269,"01:11:31,500","01:11:33,291",Good to see you. Come in.
1270,"01:11:39,416","01:11:41,208",How is he? How's your father?
1271,"01:11:41,291","01:11:45,250","He's... He's still with us,
hanging in there."
1272,"01:11:50,000","01:11:51,833",Do you want some food? I made soup.
1273,"01:11:53,916","01:11:55,708","Uh, no? How about some coffee?"
1274,"01:11:56,291","01:11:57,875",Okay.
1275,"01:11:59,708","01:12:01,548","Well, just let me know
if you change your mind."
1276,"01:12:01,625","01:12:02,875",I made way too much.
1277,"01:12:04,583","01:12:08,250","You are going in the bath now?
Yes, with Ducky? Who else?"
1278,"01:12:09,375","01:12:10,375",Bubbles?
1279,"01:12:10,916","01:12:12,166",What a good daddy.
1280,"01:12:13,500","01:12:15,333","Splash some water for me too, okay?"
1281,"01:12:18,291","01:12:19,291",H... Hey.
1282,"01:12:19,750","01:12:20,750",Hey.
1283,"01:12:23,500","01:12:24,875",You're in the middle of things.
1284,"01:12:24,958","01:12:27,708","No, nothing. Nothing. Everything's fine."
1285,"01:12:27,791","01:12:30,791","I just... just want to say hi,
just homesick."
1286,"01:12:33,208","01:12:35,375",Will do. Thanks.
1287,"01:12:37,541","01:12:38,916",Settle back...
1288,"01:12:40,333","01:12:42,375",Be aware of your sitting posture.
1289,"01:12:43,791","01:12:46,250",Remember that the foundation of meditation
1290,"01:12:47,125","01:12:50,666",is just to sit and know that you're safe.
1291,"01:12:51,666","01:12:52,916",All other aspects of the...
1292,"01:13:24,708","01:13:26,250","How you doing, Rachel?"
1293,"01:13:27,833","01:13:28,875",Doing okay.
1294,"01:13:30,541","01:13:31,541",How's Dad doing?
1295,"01:13:32,833","01:13:33,958",Hanging in.
1296,"01:13:34,708","01:13:35,708",Still there.
1297,"01:13:36,708","01:13:37,791",That's good.
1298,"01:13:38,916","01:13:39,916",Yep.
1299,"01:13:40,666","01:13:43,875","Well, you know what I'm...
I'm supposed to be telling you, right?"
1300,"01:13:44,541","01:13:45,916",About smoking out here.
1301,"01:13:47,208","01:13:49,291","Well, let's just say that I did, okay?"
1302,"01:13:51,208","01:13:52,208","Yep, yep."
1303,"01:13:52,916","01:13:53,916",Thanks.
1304,"01:14:40,625","01:14:42,583",How many times a day do you do that?
1305,"01:14:42,666","01:14:44,083",Just when I can.
1306,"01:14:44,166","01:14:46,500","I usually don't have the time,
but it helps."
1307,"01:14:47,833","01:14:49,375",Do you want to join me?
1308,"01:14:49,458","01:14:50,333",Thanks.
1309,"01:14:50,416","01:14:53,666","Maybe I'll start when the kids are older,
out of the house."
1310,"01:14:56,041","01:14:57,708",I'm struggling with writing this.
1311,"01:14:58,208","01:15:00,333",I think you should ask Rachel.
1312,"01:15:01,041","01:15:02,041",Really?
1313,"01:15:09,833","01:15:10,833",Are you busy?
1314,"01:15:12,708","01:15:16,916","I'm working on this thing, his obituary.
I was hoping that you could help with it."
1315,"01:15:18,833","01:15:20,750","I don't know anything
about making those things."
1316,"01:15:20,833","01:15:21,958",Me neither.
1317,"01:15:22,458","01:15:23,750",Vincent was proud to work for
1318,"01:15:23,833","01:15:26,041","the Department of Citywide
Administrative Services."
1319,"01:15:26,125","01:15:28,916","After 32 years,
he retired as a senior supervisor,"
1320,"01:15:29,000","01:15:30,040",beloved by his colleagues.
1321,"01:15:30,083","01:15:33,500","Vincent will be remembered for
his dedication to his family and friends,"
1322,"01:15:33,583","01:15:35,708","his welcoming spirit, warm wit,"
1323,"01:15:35,791","01:15:37,750",and an unwavering love for the Jets.
1324,"01:15:41,583","01:15:42,583",That's it?
1325,"01:15:43,041","01:15:44,041",So far.
1326,"01:15:44,666","01:15:47,916","And I know it all sounds so... dry,"
1327,"01:15:48,000","01:15:51,000","but I'm not sure how to sum up his life
in just a few words."
1328,"01:15:51,583","01:15:53,142",It seems like a pretty good job so far.
1329,"01:15:53,166","01:15:55,333","Uh, I don't know
who reads those things. I don't."
1330,"01:15:55,416","01:15:57,416","Uh, if you knew the person,
you knew the person."
1331,"01:15:57,500","01:15:59,875","It's more a record, just to have,"
1332,"01:15:59,958","01:16:03,250","like saying, ""This person existed,
in case anyone wants to know."""
1333,"01:16:03,333","01:16:05,166",I... I... I'm gonna put money
1334,"01:16:05,958","01:16:09,041","that you could write anything,
and no one's gonna notice, all right?"
1335,"01:16:09,750","01:16:11,750","Married a couple of crazy bitches,"
1336,"01:16:11,833","01:16:13,375",raised a few crazy bitches.
1337,"01:16:13,458","01:16:14,458",Thanks.
1338,"01:16:15,291","01:16:17,250","Okay, serious, right?"
1339,"01:16:17,750","01:16:19,166","Vincent, uh..."
1340,"01:16:20,625","01:16:21,750",loved the Jets.
1341,"01:16:21,833","01:16:22,708","Yeah, got that."
1342,"01:16:22,791","01:16:25,500","Um, he loves laughing
at, uh, stupid shit."
1343,"01:16:26,041","01:16:27,875","Uh, he likes old movies,"
1344,"01:16:28,958","01:16:30,333",listens to records.
1345,"01:16:30,416","01:16:31,416",Uh...
1346,"01:16:31,875","01:16:32,875","He, uh..."
1347,"01:16:33,750","01:16:36,041","He calls... He calls on, uh,"
1348,"01:16:36,666","01:16:39,666","the news radio sometimes
and gets into it with them."
1349,"01:16:40,791","01:16:45,583","Uh, he gets crazy mad,
starts yelling about things,"
1350,"01:16:45,666","01:16:47,083",then forgets about what.
1351,"01:16:48,000","01:16:51,625","He doesn't give a fuck
about a lot of things"
1352,"01:16:51,708","01:16:53,166",you shouldn't give a fuck about.
1353,"01:16:53,250","01:16:57,583","""Doesn't give a fuck
about a lot of things you shouldn't."""
1354,"01:16:57,666","01:16:58,708","Well, that's true."
1355,"01:16:58,791","01:17:01,083","- Everything I said is true.
- I know."
1356,"01:17:01,166","01:17:02,958","And it's more interesting
than what I wrote."
1357,"01:17:03,500","01:17:05,208","But in the end, it's a list too."
1358,"01:17:05,291","01:17:06,291","Ah, I tried."
1359,"01:17:07,833","01:17:11,500","One day, this is after Sarah passed,"
1360,"01:17:11,583","01:17:14,101","and, Katie, you just left for college
or it's the summer before,"
1361,"01:17:14,125","01:17:18,000","but you... you weren't in the city,
and, Rachel, you had..."
1362,"01:17:18,625","01:17:21,625","You were spending a lot of nights out,
so it wasn't that uncommon"
1363,"01:17:21,708","01:17:25,916","for Dad and I to find ourselves
in the home alone together at night."
1364,"01:17:26,000","01:17:27,666","I didn't need much help with schoolwork,"
1365,"01:17:27,750","01:17:31,500","and, you know, he was still mourning,"
1366,"01:17:32,125","01:17:35,375",but we'd watch a film together sometimes
1367,"01:17:35,458","01:17:37,083",after dinner or a TV show.
1368,"01:17:37,166","01:17:39,708","And this is a time
I still think about a lot."
1369,"01:17:39,791","01:17:42,166",It was... It was calm.
1370,"01:17:43,291","01:17:49,541","Well, one night, he got really upset
at what we were watching."
1371,"01:17:49,625","01:17:52,583","I don't know what it was
other than that someone was dying in it,"
1372,"01:17:52,666","01:17:55,125",and he wanted to explain to me
1373,"01:17:55,208","01:17:58,875","that the death
we were watching in the film"
1374,"01:17:58,958","01:18:02,791","had no relationship to how it was in life,"
1375,"01:18:02,875","01:18:06,041","that books, and movies,"
1376,"01:18:06,125","01:18:08,208","and everything that tried
to show death got it wrong."
1377,"01:18:08,291","01:18:10,166","That the act itself
of putting it into images,"
1378,"01:18:10,250","01:18:12,250","into words, is where it all went wrong."
1379,"01:18:12,333","01:18:16,333","It was a big lie. Like the thing
we were watching that... that..."
1380,"01:18:16,416","01:18:18,208","Oh, I can remember that."
1381,"01:18:19,291","01:18:22,416","""The only way to sum up a person's life,"
1382,"01:18:22,500","01:18:25,583","the only way to put things in perspective,"
1383,"01:18:26,416","01:18:31,333","what they did, who they were,
how they loved, and were..."""
1384,"01:18:32,250","01:18:34,250","- What's wrong?
- No, no. He's sleeping."
1385,"01:18:34,333","01:18:35,625",It's just time for me to leave.
1386,"01:18:37,416","01:18:38,625",That was crazy.
1387,"01:18:39,333","01:18:40,933","Oh my God, I thought something happened."
1388,"01:18:41,000","01:18:42,041",Me too.
1389,"01:18:42,125","01:18:43,541",This is crazy.
1390,"01:18:43,625","01:18:46,500","I mean, we were all just on edge.
It feels so wrong."
1391,"01:18:46,583","01:18:48,750",I'll go see her off.
1392,"01:18:48,833","01:18:50,416",What? No. Wa... Wait a second.
1393,"01:18:50,500","01:18:52,958","Don't leave us hanging like that.
You were gonna..."
1394,"01:18:54,833","01:18:56,541",Tell us what Dad said about dying.
1395,"01:18:57,041","01:18:58,041",Right.
1396,"01:18:59,500","01:19:03,958","Just that the only way to communicate
how death truly feels"
1397,"01:19:04,041","01:19:05,125",is through absence.
1398,"01:19:05,208","01:19:07,750",Everything else is fantasy.
1399,"01:19:10,000","01:19:12,291",Okay.
1400,"01:19:13,500","01:19:14,666","So, basically..."
1401,"01:19:15,708","01:19:16,958",don't write anything.
1402,"01:19:17,583","01:19:19,375",I think what Dad was saying is that
1403,"01:19:19,458","01:19:22,750","we won't really know
who he was till after."
1404,"01:19:23,500","01:19:26,916","But I think I know who people are
when they're still living, right?"
1405,"01:19:27,000","01:19:28,166",Yeah.
1406,"01:19:29,458","01:19:31,125","Kinda. Uh, well,"
1407,"01:19:31,916","01:19:33,500",who they are right now.
1408,"01:19:34,666","01:19:35,583","I, uh..."
1409,"01:19:37,625","01:19:39,250","It's none of my business, but..."
1410,"01:19:40,458","01:19:43,333","I hear you going at it with Tracey,
but it's just, you know..."
1411,"01:19:43,416","01:19:46,125",...who she is right now as a teenager.
1412,"01:19:46,208","01:19:47,500",You know that.
1413,"01:19:47,583","01:19:49,250",I think what Pops meant
1414,"01:19:50,000","01:19:51,000",was
1415,"01:19:51,916","01:19:52,833",the whole thing.
1416,"01:19:52,916","01:19:55,500","Like, all of it, you know?"
1417,"01:19:56,000","01:19:59,833","All the different times,
different people we can be,"
1418,"01:20:01,083","01:20:03,250","you know, for it all."
1419,"01:20:07,208","01:20:08,208",Yeah.
1420,"01:20:10,125","01:20:12,125",It's easy to forget with Tracey.
1421,"01:20:12,791","01:20:14,708",It feels like she'll be like this forever.
1422,"01:20:14,791","01:20:16,125",No.
1423,"01:20:16,208","01:20:18,458","She'll still be spoiled when she's older,"
1424,"01:20:18,541","01:20:20,166",but a different kind of spoiled.
1425,"01:20:23,166","01:20:24,291",I'm playing.
1426,"01:20:24,375","01:20:25,375","Yes, I know."
1427,"01:20:32,208","01:20:35,208",I'm sorry I wasn't here more to help you.
1428,"01:20:36,000","01:20:37,208",I know it was a lot.
1429,"01:20:40,250","01:20:41,375",It's fine.
1430,"01:20:43,833","01:20:45,041",I liked it.
1431,"01:20:47,458","01:20:48,541",But thanks.
1432,"01:20:48,625","01:20:51,041",And I hope you don't leave this place.
1433,"01:20:51,125","01:20:52,125",Why?
1434,"01:20:52,541","01:20:55,041","Because I want to keep
the apartment in the family."
1435,"01:21:01,625","01:21:03,875","Do you want to go in there
together right now?"
1436,"01:21:06,333","01:21:08,291","Come on, let's do it."
1437,"01:21:22,666","01:21:25,333",Look who's here.
1438,"01:21:26,875","01:21:28,666",Hi.
1439,"01:21:31,375","01:21:33,208","Daddy, hi, it's me."
1440,"01:21:33,291","01:21:34,291",Up.
1441,"01:21:35,791","01:21:37,041","What's that, Daddy?"
1442,"01:21:38,166","01:21:40,833","I don't understand.
You want me to move you?"
1443,"01:21:41,625","01:21:43,041",Will you say it again?
1444,"01:21:43,125","01:21:44,833",I... I think Dad wants to sit up.
1445,"01:21:44,916","01:21:47,333","- Really?
- Dad?"
1446,"01:21:48,125","01:21:49,851","- Watch the painting!
- Okay."
1447,"01:21:49,875","01:21:51,017","- Oh my God.
- Guys..."
1448,"01:21:51,041","01:21:53,142","- Guys, is this a good idea?
- Go slow."
1449,"01:21:53,166","01:21:54,625","Okay. Be careful, please."
1450,"01:21:54,708","01:21:56,875","- Watch his feet.
- Follow me."
1451,"01:21:56,958","01:21:58,642","- Watch.
- Here you go, Dad."
1452,"01:21:58,666","01:22:01,166","- Keep him straight.
- Okay. Okay."
1453,"01:22:01,250","01:22:03,250","- Okay.
- We're doing it."
1454,"01:22:03,333","01:22:04,375",Oh.
1455,"01:22:06,416","01:22:08,208",Okay. All right.
1456,"01:22:09,041","01:22:10,541",I think he wants to sit in his chair.
1457,"01:22:10,625","01:22:13,833","In? Is that wise?
What if we need to move him suddenly?"
1458,"01:22:14,416","01:22:15,416",Where?
1459,"01:22:15,750","01:22:18,625","- Uh, okay. Okay.
- Okay. Fine."
1460,"01:22:19,583","01:22:22,000","- Here.
- Oh yeah, get the other chair."
1461,"01:22:24,250","01:22:25,250",Ooh.
1462,"01:22:25,833","01:22:27,393","- Yeah?
- Yeah, got it."
1463,"01:22:27,875","01:22:29,625",Move the monitor over here.
1464,"01:22:29,708","01:22:31,188","- Okay.
- Okay, wait."
1465,"01:22:31,708","01:22:34,583","Uh, feet.
I'm gonna lift your feet, Dad, okay?"
1466,"01:22:34,666","01:22:37,059","- Lock it. Lock it.
- Okay. Yeah, lock it."
1467,"01:22:46,083","01:22:48,083","One, two, three."
1468,"01:22:56,333","01:22:59,166","Yeah,
I'll plug it in the back."
1469,"01:22:59,250","01:23:00,708","Boom. Okay, here."
1470,"01:23:00,791","01:23:02,458",Yeah. Thank you.
1471,"01:23:02,958","01:23:05,291","Oh, watch it."
1472,"01:23:05,375","01:23:06,695","- Got it?
- Yeah."
1473,"01:23:08,000","01:23:09,476","- It's plugged in.
- Okay."
1474,"01:23:09,500","01:23:11,083",Oxygen's flowing.
1475,"01:23:11,166","01:23:13,583",Okay.
1476,"01:23:13,666","01:23:15,125",Yeah.
1477,"01:23:28,583","01:23:30,851","What do we do?
I don't think he's supposed to eat."
1478,"01:23:30,875","01:23:34,000","We'll just hang out. We can watch
a movie or a game or something."
1479,"01:23:34,083","01:23:35,166","Yeah, uh..."
1480,"01:23:35,250","01:23:36,916","Titans blew, uh, our parlay,"
1481,"01:23:37,000","01:23:40,208","but, uh, we can still catch
the... the Bills if you want."
1482,"01:23:42,500","01:23:43,875","Uh, you want that?"
1483,"01:23:43,958","01:23:45,758","- Turn him around.
- Yeah."
1484,"01:23:50,166","01:23:51,708","- Okay.
- Okay, okay."
1485,"01:23:51,791","01:23:55,666",Hey.
1486,"01:23:57,125","01:23:59,666",That was terrible.
1487,"01:23:59,750","01:24:00,875","Oh, Daddy."
1488,"01:24:20,166","01:24:22,666","Everyone, please, just..."
1489,"01:24:26,166","01:24:28,958","- This sound is...
- Uh, Dad..."
1490,"01:24:29,041","01:24:30,750","Wait, you can't!"
1491,"01:24:43,166","01:24:45,916","- No, no, no.
- No, no, no. I..."
1492,"01:24:46,000","01:24:47,375",No. Let me do it.
1493,"01:24:49,916","01:24:52,000",This... I still have
1494,"01:24:52,750","01:24:54,208",more left in me.
1495,"01:25:28,041","01:25:29,708","Okay, enough of the shocked looks."
1496,"01:25:29,791","01:25:31,458",I've been in bed for long enough.
1497,"01:25:42,750","01:25:43,750",Oh.
1498,"01:25:44,375","01:25:45,375",Uh...
1499,"01:25:46,000","01:25:48,875","And... And I thank you for trying, but..."
1500,"01:25:51,708","01:25:52,708",No.
1501,"01:25:53,250","01:25:54,541",Rachel's your sister.
1502,"01:25:55,875","01:25:57,125",She is my daughter.
1503,"01:25:58,416","01:26:01,083",I didn't raise her like my own.
1504,"01:26:01,166","01:26:02,500",She is my own.
1505,"01:26:02,583","01:26:04,541","If blood had an influence on her,"
1506,"01:26:04,625","01:26:06,666","she would have had
a very different father."
1507,"01:26:06,750","01:26:09,000",You would have had a dad like my dad.
1508,"01:26:09,083","01:26:11,750",My dad was a fucking jerk.
1509,"01:26:11,833","01:26:13,250","Well, you know that."
1510,"01:26:13,333","01:26:15,625","We were related, but..."
1511,"01:26:16,958","01:26:18,875",he was no father.
1512,"01:26:23,541","01:26:26,958",You have no idea how much
1513,"01:26:27,541","01:26:29,458","Rachel cares about you,"
1514,"01:26:29,541","01:26:31,708",how much you mean to her.
1515,"01:26:31,791","01:26:34,875","When you went away to college,
you moved out,"
1516,"01:26:34,958","01:26:37,291",I've never seen her so sad.
1517,"01:26:37,375","01:26:40,541","Well, only when her mother
got sick and left us."
1518,"01:26:43,166","01:26:44,958",I kept waiting for the day
1519,"01:26:45,041","01:26:48,375","when you both would realize
why you fight so much."
1520,"01:26:50,375","01:26:52,000",How similar you are.
1521,"01:26:52,541","01:26:54,833",I want you all to try when I'm gone.
1522,"01:26:54,916","01:26:57,791","I know that
a better relationship is possible."
1523,"01:26:58,625","01:27:01,875","You will be connected after I'm gone,"
1524,"01:27:01,958","01:27:03,375",even more so because of it.
1525,"01:27:03,458","01:27:04,625",I just know it.
1526,"01:27:08,833","01:27:09,833",Christina.
1527,"01:27:13,708","01:27:14,708","Christina,"
1528,"01:27:16,416","01:27:18,125",I know you didn't have it right.
1529,"01:27:19,333","01:27:22,500","I heard what you said about that time
when we watched movies together."
1530,"01:27:22,583","01:27:24,500","Um,"
1531,"01:27:24,583","01:27:28,500","that was the only time
I never gave it to you."
1532,"01:27:29,000","01:27:31,291",No one else really did either.
1533,"01:27:32,583","01:27:34,541",I can't tell you how sorry I am.
1534,"01:27:36,625","01:27:38,125","You just... Well, you just..."
1535,"01:27:38,208","01:27:40,833","From the moment that you could walk,"
1536,"01:27:40,916","01:27:43,375",you didn't seem to need anyone.
1537,"01:27:43,458","01:27:45,041",You could be left alone.
1538,"01:27:45,125","01:27:47,791","And then, when your mom passed,
you seemed okay, too."
1539,"01:27:47,875","01:27:50,541","And I should have realized
that's not possible,"
1540,"01:27:50,625","01:27:52,125","that you were hurting just as much,"
1541,"01:27:52,208","01:27:55,208","but I was in so much pain, I couldn't see."
1542,"01:27:57,041","01:27:59,375",And then I fell in love again. And then I...
1543,"01:28:02,125","01:28:03,125",Eh...
1544,"01:28:03,583","01:28:06,208","That girl of yours
will not be left wanting."
1545,"01:28:07,833","01:28:12,416","I watch you and that love of yours
for her, for David,"
1546,"01:28:12,500","01:28:16,666","for whoever's gonna join you next
if you choose to have more,"
1547,"01:28:16,750","01:28:19,583",and I thank you.
1548,"01:28:20,958","01:28:24,625","I thank you for doing better than me,"
1549,"01:28:24,708","01:28:26,041",for doing more.
1550,"01:28:29,958","01:28:31,666","Damn, I love this city."
1551,"01:28:34,166","01:28:35,583",I marvel at it.
1552,"01:28:37,041","01:28:42,250","Like the roaches and the weeds,
somehow, we keep making it through."
1553,"01:28:44,250","01:28:47,750",I sure will miss the ghosts
1554,"01:28:48,541","01:28:51,208",and memories I have on every block.
1555,"01:28:53,750","01:28:55,750",I guess I'll be one soon enough.
1556,"01:28:59,041","01:29:05,166","There was one other real true love
besides your mother's."
1557,"01:29:05,250","01:29:07,333",This love happened when I was very young.
1558,"01:29:07,416","01:29:09,375",The summer I went into the Coast Guard.
1559,"01:29:10,375","01:29:13,041",Her name was Bliss.
1560,"01:29:14,250","01:29:16,958","I know,
but it's not so uncommon in Ireland,"
1561,"01:29:17,041","01:29:18,250","and she was Irish,"
1562,"01:29:18,916","01:29:19,916",from Queens.
1563,"01:29:21,166","01:29:23,583","And like all of you,"
1564,"01:29:24,458","01:29:25,958","like your mothers,"
1565,"01:29:26,666","01:29:28,333",she could handle herself.
1566,"01:29:28,958","01:29:31,916","But I had never met
anyone like Bliss before."
1567,"01:29:32,625","01:29:35,500",She was interested in more things
1568,"01:29:35,583","01:29:38,833","than anyone I've ever met until then,"
1569,"01:29:38,916","01:29:40,375",maybe since then.
1570,"01:29:40,958","01:29:42,375","She found life,"
1571,"01:29:44,375","01:29:48,291","the world, people, interesting."
1572,"01:29:52,041","01:29:54,791",And it was intoxicating to be around.
1573,"01:29:54,875","01:29:56,458",I couldn't... I couldn't get enough.
1574,"01:29:56,958","01:30:00,541",I wanted to see like her.
1575,"01:30:00,625","01:30:03,125",I aimed to see like her.
1576,"01:30:05,708","01:30:07,458",And then I went away.
1577,"01:30:08,416","01:30:10,333","And by the time I got out,"
1578,"01:30:11,791","01:30:12,958","my letters had stopped,"
1579,"01:30:13,041","01:30:15,833","and the way life can,
things just drifted apart."
1580,"01:30:17,041","01:30:22,416","In fact, we didn't see
or run into each other again."
1581,"01:30:23,125","01:30:25,833",Except for one time.
1582,"01:30:26,416","01:30:28,666","Each in our own group,
passing each other on the street."
1583,"01:30:28,750","01:30:29,916",It was so brief.
1584,"01:30:33,291","01:30:37,791","When I grabbed her arm and said, ""Hello,"""
1585,"01:30:38,666","01:30:41,958","she said, ""You still remember me?"""
1586,"01:30:44,291","01:30:47,208","I said, ""Of course."""
1587,"01:30:47,875","01:30:50,375","""You... You changed my life."""
1588,"01:30:52,416","01:30:53,833",That made her smile.
1589,"01:30:55,541","01:30:58,416","But if there was any guilt I have,"
1590,"01:30:58,500","01:31:01,375",it's that maybe I should have...
1591,"01:31:02,250","01:31:04,375",I could have expressed myself better.
1592,"01:31:06,291","01:31:07,833",There was no big lesson there.
1593,"01:31:08,583","01:31:09,583",I...
1594,"01:31:10,750","01:31:13,458","We know each will die
with at least one regret."
1595,"01:31:14,416","01:31:16,791",But I...
1596,"01:31:18,541","01:31:22,916","It's just, uh, love
that I want you to know about."
1597,"01:31:24,791","01:31:27,916",Something that fundamentally changed me.
1598,"01:31:28,708","01:31:30,208",Dad?
1599,"01:31:31,666","01:31:32,666",Made me
1600,"01:31:34,250","01:31:35,250",who I am.
1601,"01:31:36,125","01:31:37,125",Daddy.
1602,"01:31:37,166","01:31:38,351","- Dad.
- Daddy."
1603,"01:31:38,375","01:31:39,541","- Dad?
- Dad?"
1604,"01:31:39,625","01:31:41,000","- Who, uh...
- Dad!"
1605,"01:31:41,083","01:31:42,208",I...
1606,"01:31:42,291","01:31:44,500","- Dad.
- No, no, no."
1607,"01:31:44,583","01:31:46,625","- Dad.
- Daddy. Daddy. Dad."
1608,"01:31:47,416","01:31:48,416",Dad!
1609,"01:32:16,416","01:32:18,750",Mmm.
1610,"01:33:17,291","01:33:18,291",Dad is gone.
