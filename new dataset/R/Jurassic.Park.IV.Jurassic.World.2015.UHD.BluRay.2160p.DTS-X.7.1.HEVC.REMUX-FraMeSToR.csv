Your flight's in two hours."

minutes away, 60 with traffic."
7,"00:02:26,188","00:02:28,858","How many minutes to get
your little butt in the van?"
8,"00:02:28,941","00:02:29,942",Hmm?
9,"00:02:30,818","00:02:32,069",How many of those?
10,"00:02:32,945","00:02:35,072","- Feed the monster under your bed?
- Yes."
11,"00:02:37,992","00:02:39,994","Call me every day,"
12,"00:02:40,077","00:02:42,830","and text me pics, so I don't
forget what you look like."
13,"00:02:42,955","00:02:44,123",I'm only gonna be gone a week.
14,"00:02:44,206","00:02:45,249",Zach.
15,"00:02:46,250","00:02:48,753",You're not going off to war here. Please.
16,"00:02:48,878","00:02:50,171",Come on.
17,"00:02:50,254","00:02:53,090","- I will see you later.
- I love you."
18,"00:02:53,257","00:02:54,258",VÃ¡monos.
19,"00:02:54,342","00:02:56,260","- Bye, okay?
- Bye."
20,"00:02:56,385","00:02:58,512","Are you in, buddy?"
21,"00:03:02,266","00:03:03,601","I know it hurts, sweetheart."
22,"00:03:03,726","00:03:05,061",Are you gonna be okay?
23,"00:03:11,025","00:03:12,109",Everything right on there?
24,"00:03:12,902","00:03:14,445",I'm so jealous.
25,"00:03:14,528","00:03:17,239","You're gonna have so much fun.
I love you."
26,"00:03:17,323","00:03:18,908","I love you, too."
27,"00:03:25,831","00:03:27,541","Okay, great."
28,"00:03:27,625","00:03:30,544","All right, um, let's give these
to your brother, okay?"
29,"00:03:31,253","00:03:33,422","- You hold these, please. Can you hold these?
- Zach."
30,"00:03:33,506","00:03:35,174","Honey, I need you to take care of these."
31,"00:03:35,299","00:03:36,092",Yeah.
32,"00:03:36,175","00:03:37,176","- Hey.
- All right."
33,"00:03:37,301","00:03:38,469",Listen to your mother.
34,"00:03:38,594","00:03:41,097","Take care of your brother.
Answer your phone."
35,"00:03:41,222","00:03:42,890","I'm serious.
It's the green button."
36,"00:03:42,973","00:03:44,975","When you see my name, push it, okay?"
37,"00:03:45,059","00:03:46,143","And remember,"
38,"00:03:46,268","00:03:49,021","something chases you, run."
39,"00:03:50,106","00:03:51,190",Come on.
40,"00:03:51,315","00:03:53,067","- All right.
- You're funny. Okay, let's go. Come on."
41,"00:03:53,150","00:03:54,735","- Bye, guys.
- Bye."
42,"00:03:54,819","00:03:56,570","- I miss you already.
- Yeah."
43,"00:03:58,781","00:04:01,367",So much for our last family breakfast.
44,"00:04:02,368","00:04:04,662",Why do you have to say things like that?
45,"00:04:06,205","00:04:08,082",Did you call your sister?
46,"00:04:08,165","00:04:10,167",Straight to voicemail.
47,"00:04:10,292","00:04:13,462","It'll be fine. She handles
20,000 people a day, right?"
48,"00:04:14,588","00:04:16,465",She can handle two more.
49,"00:04:20,469","00:04:21,971",How big is the island?
50,"00:04:22,054","00:04:23,764",Big.
51,"00:04:23,848","00:04:25,349",But how many pounds?
52,"00:04:25,433","00:04:26,809",That doesn't make sense.
53,"00:04:30,271","00:04:32,940","When they first opened,
they had eight species."
54,"00:04:33,065","00:04:35,943","Now they have 14 herbivores
and six carnivores."
55,"00:04:36,026","00:04:37,820",That's 50 tons of food a week.
56,"00:04:57,465","00:05:01,010","Welcome to Isla Nublar,
home of Jurassic World."
57,"00:05:01,218","00:05:04,013","We hope you have a safe
and enjoyable stay with us."
58,"00:05:07,099","00:05:08,893",Where's Aunt Claire?
59,"00:05:30,956","00:05:33,334","Okay. Those of you
in the front of the train"
60,"00:05:33,417","00:05:35,586",should be able to see our main gates.
61,"00:05:48,390","00:05:49,850",Please obey all park rules.
62,"00:05:49,934","00:05:53,729","Proper attire, including shoes and shirts,
must be worn at all times."
63,"00:05:53,812","00:05:57,608","Your aunt arranged to greet you at 1:00.
Can he slow down?"
64,"00:05:57,691","00:05:58,734",Nope.
65,"00:05:58,817","00:06:00,444",Come on!
66,"00:06:06,492","00:06:08,494","Your aunt's got you VIP access,"
67,"00:06:08,702","00:06:10,955","so you can get in all the rides
without waiting in line."
68,"00:06:11,121","00:06:12,164",Let's go.
69,"00:06:12,248","00:06:13,249","Dude, she said we had to wait."
70,"00:06:13,332","00:06:15,251",I don't wanna wait anymore.
71,"00:06:44,321","00:06:47,700","Hal Osterly, vice president.
Jim Drucker, bad hair."
72,"00:06:48,158","00:06:50,202","Erica Brand, deserves better."
73,"00:06:50,327","00:06:52,997","Hal, Jim, Erica.
Hal, Jim, Erica."
74,"00:06:53,080","00:06:55,541",And I am Claire.
75,"00:06:55,666","00:06:57,251",Three minutes late.
76,"00:07:00,879","00:07:03,173",Welcome to Jurassic World.
77,"00:07:04,508","00:07:07,011","While year over year,
revenue continues to climb,"
78,"00:07:07,094","00:07:09,305",operating costs are higher than ever.
79,"00:07:09,388","00:07:13,100","Our shareholders have been patient,
but let's be honest,"
80,"00:07:13,183","00:07:16,270","no one is impressed
by a dinosaur anymore."
81,"00:07:16,353","00:07:19,481","Twenty years ago, de-extinction
was right up there with magic."

83,"00:07:21,358","00:07:23,736",like an elephant from the city zoo.
84,"00:07:23,861","00:07:26,155","That doesn't mean asset
development is falling behind."
85,"00:07:26,739","00:07:30,618","Our DNA excavators discover
new species every year."
86,"00:07:30,701","00:07:35,247","But consumers want them
bigger, louder, more teeth."
87,"00:07:35,914","00:07:37,374",The good news?
88,"00:07:37,499","00:07:40,502","Our advances in gene splicing have
opened up a whole new frontier."
89,"00:07:41,712","00:07:44,548","We've learned more from
genetics in the past decade"
90,"00:07:44,632","00:07:46,634",than a century of digging up bones.
91,"00:07:47,509","00:07:48,594","So,"
92,"00:07:49,678","00:07:52,556","when you say you want
to sponsor an attraction,"
93,"00:07:52,723","00:07:53,891",what do you have in mind?
94,"00:07:55,601","00:07:57,144",We want to be thrilled.
95,"00:07:57,227","00:07:58,729",Don't we all?
96,"00:08:02,858","00:08:04,318",The Indominus rex.

98,"00:08:07,237","00:08:10,658","How did you get two different kinds
of dinosaurs to, you know..."
99,"00:08:11,575","00:08:15,162","Oh, Indominus wasn't bred.
She was designed."
100,"00:08:16,038","00:08:19,500","She will be 50 feet
long when fully grown."
101,"00:08:19,583","00:08:21,251",Bigger than the T-Rex.
102,"00:08:21,377","00:08:25,089","Every time we've unveiled a new
asset, attendance has spiked."
103,"00:08:25,172","00:08:28,967","Global news coverage, celebrity visitors."

106,"00:08:34,223","00:08:36,183",She already is.
107,"00:08:50,072","00:08:51,365",Come on!
108,"00:08:51,573","00:08:52,574",Relax.
109,"00:08:53,117","00:08:54,159",Come on.
110,"00:08:54,284","00:08:56,203","Dude, chill."

""three-horned face"" in Greek,"
115,"00:09:19,643","00:09:22,646",Triceratops is half as tall as T-Rex
116,"00:09:22,771","00:09:26,650",...as one-hundred trillion tons of TNT.

120,"00:09:39,747","00:09:41,373","The same four things
in everything that ever lived."
121,"00:09:41,498","00:09:43,041","Hey, don't wander off, all right?"
122,"00:09:43,125","00:09:45,210",Mom's not paying me for babysitting.

125,"00:09:49,965","00:09:52,009","Okay, yeah. No, I'm gonna have to go.
My nephews are here."
126,"00:09:53,385","00:09:54,636",Hi.
127,"00:09:54,720","00:09:55,929",Oh.
128,"00:09:56,263","00:09:58,474","Oh, my gosh, you're so sweet."
129,"00:09:59,516","00:10:01,727","Whoa, Zach."
130,"00:10:01,852","00:10:04,062","Last time I saw you, you were like..."
131,"00:10:04,146","00:10:05,355",That must've been what?
132,"00:10:05,439","00:10:07,608","- Three, four years ago?
- Uh, Seven."
133,"00:10:07,691","00:10:09,568","Seven years, but, you know, close."
134,"00:10:11,111","00:10:13,322","So, I see you already
got your wristbands."
135,"00:10:14,698","00:10:15,866",And this is for food.
136,"00:10:15,949","00:10:18,410","And Zara here is going
to take great care of you"

140,"00:10:23,707","00:10:25,876","I really wish that I could,"
141,"00:10:25,959","00:10:28,962","but tomorrow I can take you
into the control room,"
142,"00:10:29,046","00:10:31,089","show you behind the scenes
and all of that."
143,"00:10:31,215","00:10:33,842","That's gonna be cool, right?"
144,"00:10:35,761","00:10:40,891","Okay, so I will see you tonight at 6:00."
145,"00:10:40,974","00:10:42,184","No, don't forget you have the..."
146,"00:10:42,267","00:10:44,394","Right, of course.
I will see you tonight at 8:00."
147,"00:10:44,478","00:10:49,191","What time do you go to sleep?
Or do you go to sleep at different times?"
148,"00:10:51,068","00:10:53,737","Okay, so, have fun,"
149,"00:10:53,821","00:10:56,406","and take very good care of them, okay?"
150,"00:10:57,574","00:10:59,535","Yeah. No, I'm here."
151,"00:11:03,330","00:11:06,458","It's those two juvenile Triceratops.
They're going at it again."
152,"00:11:06,583","00:11:07,709","Should I tranq them, or are you"
153,"00:11:07,793","00:11:09,294",coming over to take care of this?
154,"00:11:09,920","00:11:11,046",Go ahead and tranq them.
155,"00:11:11,129","00:11:12,214",They're running.
156,"00:11:12,297","00:11:13,924",What's the live count?
157,"00:11:14,007","00:11:15,759","22,216."
158,"00:11:15,843","00:11:17,010","- Any incidents?
- Yes."
159,"00:11:17,094","00:11:21,056","Six kids in the Lost and Found,
28 down with heatstroke..."
160,"00:11:21,139","00:11:23,350",Where did you get that?
161,"00:11:23,433","00:11:26,895","Oh, this? I got it on eBay.
Yeah, it's pretty amazing."
162,"00:11:26,979","00:11:30,274","I got it for $150, but the mint
condition one goes for $300..."
163,"00:11:30,357","00:11:32,526","Didn't occur to you maybe
that's in poor taste?"
164,"00:11:32,609","00:11:34,236","The shirt? Yeah, no, it did."
165,"00:11:34,319","00:11:38,991","I understand people died. It was terrible,
but that first park was legit."
166,"00:11:39,116","00:11:40,993",I have a lot of respect for it.
167,"00:11:41,076","00:11:42,744",They didn't need these genetic hybrids.
168,"00:11:42,828","00:11:44,705","They just needed dinosaurs,
real dinosaurs."
169,"00:11:44,830","00:11:46,915","- Okay, please don't wear it again.
- That's kind of enough."
170,"00:11:46,999","00:11:48,125","Yeah, I wasn't gonna."
171,"00:11:48,208","00:11:49,960","- Did you close the deal?
- Looks like it."

174,"00:11:56,133","00:11:57,718","Why not just go the distance, Claire,"
175,"00:11:57,801","00:12:00,512","and just let these corporations
name the dinosaurs?"
176,"00:12:00,637","00:12:01,847",They've got all the ballparks.
177,"00:12:01,972","00:12:04,308","- Why stop there?
- Why are the West Plains closed?"

implants when they butt heads."
184,"00:12:18,155","00:12:20,198","How much longer until they
get it out of there?"
185,"00:12:20,282","00:12:22,576","He just got five
milligrams of carfentanil."
186,"00:12:22,659","00:12:27,039","Yes, he's very stoned.
So why don't we show a little sympathy?"
187,"00:12:27,164","00:12:30,417","I mean, you do understand these
are actual animals, right?"
188,"00:12:31,084","00:12:35,255","Clean up your workspace.
It's chaotic."
189,"00:12:35,339","00:12:38,467",I like to think of it as a living system.
190,"00:12:38,550","00:12:43,013","Just enough stability to keep it
from collapsing into anarchy."
191,"00:12:49,686","00:12:53,357","Inbound chopper, Jurassic 1.
ETA, 5 minutes."
192,"00:13:16,880","00:13:17,881",Claire.
193,"00:13:18,715","00:13:21,802",Mr. Masrani. You are flying.
194,"00:13:21,885","00:13:23,387",I got my license.
195,"00:13:23,512","00:13:25,722","- Two more.
- Well, two more days."
196,"00:13:25,806","00:13:26,932","- Okay.
- So,"
197,"00:13:27,057","00:13:29,059","- how's my park doing?
- Great."
198,"00:13:29,142","00:13:31,103",We're up 2.5% over last year.
199,"00:13:31,311","00:13:33,271",A bit lower than our initial projection.
200,"00:13:33,397","00:13:34,815","No, no, no, how's it doing?"
201,"00:13:34,898","00:13:38,026","Are the guests having fun?
Are the animals enjoying life?"
202,"00:13:38,110","00:13:41,697","Well, guest satisfaction
is steady in the low 90s."
203,"00:13:41,780","00:13:46,326","We don't have a way to measure
the animals' emotional experience."
204,"00:13:46,410","00:13:48,996","Sure you do.
You can see in their eyes."
205,"00:13:49,079","00:13:50,330",Right?
206,"00:13:50,414","00:13:51,790",Of course.
207,"00:13:51,915","00:13:55,919",Okay. Now show me my new dinosaur.
208,"00:13:57,629","00:13:59,256",Oh...
209,"00:14:03,468","00:14:05,053",Got it.
210,"00:14:05,137","00:14:06,388",Got it.
211,"00:14:06,930","00:14:08,390",Got it.
212,"00:14:18,608","00:14:20,569","Oh, my!"
213,"00:14:22,821","00:14:24,031","You look tense, Claire."
214,"00:14:25,323","00:14:28,618","Maybe you should just
focus on the controls."
215,"00:14:28,744","00:14:30,954",The key to a happy life is to accept
216,"00:14:31,038","00:14:33,707",you are never actually in control.
217,"00:14:33,832","00:14:34,875",Bird!
218,"00:14:39,129","00:14:42,424","You should spend a day at the beach.
Get some sun."
219,"00:14:42,591","00:14:44,051","Uh, right, so..."
220,"00:14:44,134","00:14:47,804","Marketing thought we could
offset some of the costs by..."
221,"00:14:47,929","00:14:49,973",Enough about cost.
222,"00:14:50,057","00:14:52,142","John Hammond entrusted me
with his dying wish,"
223,"00:14:52,267","00:14:54,394",and not once did he mention profits.
224,"00:14:54,478","00:14:56,605","""Spare no expense,"" he used to say."
225,"00:14:56,688","00:14:57,689","I appreciate that,"
226,"00:14:57,773","00:15:01,193","but the reality of operating
a theme park requires..."
227,"00:15:01,318","00:15:03,320","Don't forget why we built
this place, Claire."
228,"00:15:03,403","00:15:06,740","Jurassic World exists to remind
us how very small we are."
229,"00:15:06,823","00:15:09,826",How new. You can't put a price on that.
230,"00:15:09,951","00:15:13,330","Now, please, we're flying."
231,"00:15:14,372","00:15:16,208",Breathe.
232,"00:15:43,610","00:15:45,487","Is he okay?
Are you okay?"
233,"00:15:45,570","00:15:47,906",He's just being dramatic.
234,"00:15:47,989","00:15:49,783",Are you still building?
235,"00:15:50,534","00:15:52,369","We planned to open in May,"
236,"00:15:52,452","00:15:56,206","but Asset Containment insisted
we build the walls up higher."
237,"00:15:56,289","00:15:58,375",It's bigger than expected.
238,"00:16:04,381","00:16:05,924",It's a good sign.
239,"00:16:07,843","00:16:10,679",We hit a few speed bumps early on.
240,"00:16:10,762","00:16:13,890","It began to anticipate where
the food would come from."
241,"00:16:14,015","00:16:15,892",One of the handlers nearly lost an arm.
242,"00:16:15,976","00:16:19,896","The others threatened to quit
if I couldn't guarantee their safety."
243,"00:16:20,313","00:16:22,190",She's intelligent then?
244,"00:16:22,691","00:16:24,401",For a dinosaur.
245,"00:16:24,526","00:16:26,570",And that?
246,"00:16:31,199","00:16:32,784",It tried to break the glass.
247,"00:16:33,785","00:16:35,912",I like her spirit.
248,"00:16:57,267","00:17:00,854","It's white.
You never told me it was white."
249,"00:17:06,443","00:17:08,445",Think it will scare the kids?
250,"00:17:09,613","00:17:11,198",The kids?
251,"00:17:12,240","00:17:14,367",This will give the parents nightmares.
252,"00:17:15,869","00:17:17,495",Is that good?
253,"00:17:19,414","00:17:21,583",It's fantastic.
254,"00:17:25,629","00:17:27,380",Can she see us?
255,"00:17:28,089","00:17:30,217",They say it can sense thermal radiation.
256,"00:17:30,300","00:17:31,593",Like snakes.
257,"00:17:32,552","00:17:34,679",I thought there were two of them.
258,"00:17:34,804","00:17:38,225","There was a sibling in case this
one didn't survive infancy."
259,"00:17:38,308","00:17:40,310",Where's the sibling?
260,"00:17:40,435","00:17:41,478",She ate it.
261,"00:17:49,653","00:17:53,323","So, the paddock is quite safe, then?"
262,"00:17:53,448","00:17:57,994","We have the best structural
engineers in the world."
263,"00:17:58,078","00:17:59,162","Yeah, so did Hammond."
264,"00:18:01,957","00:18:04,334",There's an American Navy man here.
265,"00:18:04,417","00:18:07,379","Part of a research program
one of my companies is running."
266,"00:18:07,462","00:18:09,130",Owen Grady.
267,"00:18:10,257","00:18:11,383",I know who he is.
268,"00:18:11,508","00:18:13,426",His animals often try to escape.
269,"00:18:13,510","00:18:16,429","They are smart.
He has to be smarter."
270,"00:18:16,513","00:18:18,223",He only thinks he's smarter.
271,"00:18:19,808","00:18:21,685",I want you to bring him in.
272,"00:18:22,394","00:18:23,770",Let him inspect the paddock.
273,"00:18:25,814","00:18:28,316",Maybe he sees something we can't.
274,"00:18:44,624","00:18:46,209",Hold!
275,"00:18:52,966","00:18:54,134",Hey!
276,"00:18:58,722","00:18:59,889",Okay!
277,"00:19:00,724","00:19:01,891",Eyes on me.
278,"00:19:01,975","00:19:03,518",Blue?
279,"00:19:03,601","00:19:05,270",Blue!
280,"00:19:05,979","00:19:07,147",Watch it.
281,"00:19:07,522","00:19:08,523",Charlie. Hey!
282,"00:19:09,024","00:19:11,359",Don't give me that shit!
283,"00:19:11,443","00:19:12,569",Delta!
284,"00:19:12,652","00:19:14,070",Lock it up!
285,"00:19:14,821","00:19:16,698",Good!
286,"00:19:16,781","00:19:18,908",And we're moving!
287,"00:19:25,623","00:19:26,958",Hold!
288,"00:19:28,668","00:19:32,088",That's good. That is damn good.
289,"00:19:32,922","00:19:33,965",Very good!
290,"00:19:34,090","00:19:36,426","See, Charlie, that's what you get!"
291,"00:19:37,093","00:19:39,220","Echo, there you go! Delta!"
292,"00:19:41,097","00:19:42,098",Blue?
293,"00:19:45,435","00:19:47,604",This one's for you.
294,"00:19:50,315","00:19:51,608",Hold!
295,"00:19:52,525","00:19:53,568",Eyes up!
296,"00:19:56,863","00:19:57,864",Go.
297,"00:20:05,372","00:20:06,539","You finally did it, man."
298,"00:20:06,623","00:20:07,624",Owen.
299,"00:20:10,794","00:20:12,712","I was starting to think
I hired the wrong guys,"
300,"00:20:12,796","00:20:14,798","but, damn, you got them
eating out of your palm."
301,"00:20:14,881","00:20:17,050","You came on a good day.
It's not usually a happy ending."
302,"00:20:17,133","00:20:18,885","Is that why you're not
sending in your reports?"
303,"00:20:18,968","00:20:20,345",We've been busy.
304,"00:20:20,428","00:20:23,056",Not too busy to cash your paychecks.
305,"00:20:23,807","00:20:25,141","What do you need, buddy?"
306,"00:20:25,934","00:20:26,935",A field test.
307,"00:20:27,894","00:20:31,398","Hey. I've just seen they can
respond to commands."
308,"00:20:31,481","00:20:33,900","We need to take the research
and get it on its feet."
309,"00:20:33,983","00:20:35,360","These are wild animals, Hoskins."
310,"00:20:35,443","00:20:37,278","Trust me, you don't
want them in the field."
311,"00:20:37,362","00:20:40,573","I just saw a bond.
A real bond."
312,"00:20:40,657","00:20:42,742",Between man and beast.
313,"00:20:42,826","00:20:43,827",You're in my way.
314,"00:20:43,910","00:20:45,286","Come on.
We're the same."
315,"00:20:45,370","00:20:46,830",We're dogs of war.
316,"00:20:46,955","00:20:49,999","We know that the military
needs to reduce casualties."
317,"00:20:50,083","00:20:52,085","Some people think that
robots are the future."
318,"00:20:52,168","00:20:54,712","Look, nature gave us the most effective"
319,"00:20:54,796","00:20:57,340",killing machines 75 million years ago.
320,"00:20:57,465","00:20:59,926",And now we know they can take orders.
321,"00:21:00,009","00:21:02,679","We finally make progress and
that's the first thing he says?"
322,"00:21:02,762","00:21:04,347",Make a weapon?
323,"00:21:04,472","00:21:05,807",Shit.
324,"00:21:05,890","00:21:07,225","Come on, gents."
325,"00:21:07,350","00:21:09,352",It's grown-up time.
326,"00:21:09,436","00:21:13,148","Drones can't search tunnels and caves.
And they're hackable."
327,"00:21:13,231","00:21:14,607","The minute a real war breaks out,"
328,"00:21:14,691","00:21:16,943",all that fancy tech is gonna go dark.
329,"00:21:17,026","00:21:20,029","But that tech's not gonna eat
them if they forget to feed it."
330,"00:21:20,738","00:21:22,532",Look at these creatures.
331,"00:21:22,615","00:21:25,452","They've got millions of years
of instinct in their cells,"
332,"00:21:25,535","00:21:26,619",instinct that we can program.
333,"00:21:27,871","00:21:30,165",Their loyalty cannot be bought.
334,"00:21:31,040","00:21:32,375",These guys are gonna run
335,"00:21:32,459","00:21:34,419","straight into the enemy's
teeth and eat them,"
336,"00:21:34,544","00:21:36,463",belt buckle and all.
337,"00:21:36,546","00:21:38,965","What if they decide they
wanna be in control?"
338,"00:21:39,632","00:21:42,218","Well, then we remind them who is.
We terminate the rogues."
339,"00:21:42,343","00:21:44,554",Promote only loyal bloodlines.
340,"00:21:45,805","00:21:48,099",What? What's so funny?
341,"00:21:51,394","00:21:52,437","I don't know.
You come here"
342,"00:21:52,520","00:21:54,063","and you don't learn anything
about these animals"
343,"00:21:54,147","00:21:55,857",except what you want to know.
344,"00:21:57,066","00:21:59,694","You made them, and now
you think you own them."
345,"00:21:59,903","00:22:01,488",We do own them.
346,"00:22:02,238","00:22:04,407",Extinct animals have no rights.
347,"00:22:04,991","00:22:06,326","They're not extinct anymore, Hoskins."
348,"00:22:06,409","00:22:09,662",Exactly. We're sitting on a goldmine.
349,"00:22:09,746","00:22:13,124","And Masrani is using it
to stock a petting zoo."
350,"00:22:13,249","00:22:16,044","He just wants to teach people some humility.
He doesn't make weapons."
351,"00:22:16,127","00:22:18,838","You think that the eighth
richest man in the world"
352,"00:22:18,922","00:22:23,426","is only into oil, telecom,
and family fun parks?"
353,"00:22:23,510","00:22:25,345","He's so diversified, he doesn't
even know what he owns."
354,"00:22:25,428","00:22:27,639","How long has InGen been
practicing this pitch?"
355,"00:22:27,764","00:22:31,768","Since the day we hired you out of the Navy.
You knew the end game."
356,"00:22:31,893","00:22:35,688","These animals can replace
thousands of boots on the ground."
357,"00:22:35,772","00:22:37,774",How many lives would that save?
358,"00:22:40,276","00:22:41,569",War is part of nature.
359,"00:22:43,404","00:22:46,241","Look around, Owen.
Every living thing in this jungle"
360,"00:22:47,283","00:22:48,826",is trying to murder the other.
361,"00:22:48,993","00:22:52,038","Mother Nature's way
of testing her creations."
362,"00:22:52,121","00:22:54,541",Refining the pecking order.
363,"00:22:54,624","00:22:57,752","War is a struggle.
Struggle breeds greatness."
364,"00:22:58,962","00:23:00,046","Without that,"
365,"00:23:00,171","00:23:03,049","we end up with places like this,
charge seven bucks a soda."
366,"00:23:04,384","00:23:06,219",Do you hear yourself when you talk?
367,"00:23:09,806","00:23:13,893","This is gonna happen.
With or without you boys."
368,"00:23:14,102","00:23:15,436","Progress always wins, man."
369,"00:23:16,312","00:23:18,398",Maybe progress should lose for once.
370,"00:23:20,400","00:23:21,859",Pig loose!
371,"00:23:22,318","00:23:24,153",Pig loose!
372,"00:23:41,546","00:23:42,714","Owen, no!"
373,"00:23:46,551","00:23:48,303","No, hold your fire!"
374,"00:23:49,929","00:23:52,181","Hold your fire.
Do not fire."
375,"00:23:54,517","00:23:57,270","Put 12 amps in these animals,
they're never gonna trust me again."
376,"00:23:59,522","00:24:02,108","Blue, stand down."
377,"00:24:04,027","00:24:05,069",Stand down.
378,"00:24:06,070","00:24:08,698",Hey! What did I just say?
379,"00:24:09,824","00:24:12,160","Delta, I see you.
Back up!"
380,"00:24:14,495","00:24:15,705",Okay.
381,"00:24:15,788","00:24:16,914",Good.
382,"00:24:18,041","00:24:19,125",Good.
383,"00:24:19,709","00:24:20,710",Charlie?
384,"00:24:22,378","00:24:23,504",Stay right there.
385,"00:24:25,006","00:24:26,466",Good.
386,"00:24:28,301","00:24:29,302",Close the gate.
387,"00:24:30,053","00:24:31,512",Are you crazy?
388,"00:24:31,638","00:24:32,555",Just trust me.
389,"00:24:32,639","00:24:33,723",Close the gate!
390,"00:24:47,362","00:24:48,571",I'm okay.
391,"00:24:52,533","00:24:53,785",Yeah.
392,"00:24:58,581","00:24:59,707","You're the new guy, right?"
393,"00:25:00,416","00:25:01,417",Yeah.
394,"00:25:01,501","00:25:03,920","You ever wonder why there
was a job opening?"
395,"00:25:05,713","00:25:07,090",Hey.
396,"00:25:07,173","00:25:09,759",Don't ever turn your back to the cage.
397,"00:25:53,720","00:25:55,847","Lift me up.
I can't see!"
398,"00:25:56,055","00:25:58,141",I'm not Dad. And you're not five.
399,"00:25:58,766","00:26:02,520","I can still ride the Triceratops.
I'm 47-and-a-half inches."
400,"00:26:02,729","00:26:03,855",This place is for little kids.
401,"00:26:05,773","00:26:06,733","Yeah, I know."
402,"00:26:06,816","00:26:09,068","- Wanna go on the spinning dinosaur eggs?
- Nope."
403,"00:26:10,319","00:26:12,280",Cover up your dork pouch.
404,"00:26:12,655","00:26:13,990",Because it's my wedding.
405,"00:26:14,115","00:26:16,367","No, Alec's not having a bachelor party."
406,"00:26:16,492","00:26:18,119",Because all his friends are animals.
407,"00:26:18,369","00:26:19,370",Scatter.
408,"00:26:19,495","00:26:21,664","- What?
- Go. Run. Go!"
409,"00:26:26,961","00:26:27,962",Yuck!
410,"00:26:43,019","00:26:45,146","The next T-Rex feeding
will begin in 10 minutes."
411,"00:26:45,271","00:26:47,148","- T-Rex! Come on, man! Come on!
- Okay."
412,"00:26:47,273","00:26:48,566",Let's go!
413,"00:26:48,691","00:26:50,526","Parents be aware, this show may be"
414,"00:26:50,610","00:26:52,653",disturbing for smaller children.
415,"00:27:04,540","00:27:05,792","Hey, Mom."
416,"00:27:05,875","00:27:08,961","You were supposed to call
me when you landed."
417,"00:27:09,045","00:27:10,171",Are you having fun?
418,"00:27:10,379","00:27:12,131","Yeah, I guess."
419,"00:27:13,841","00:27:16,594","Aunt Claire gave us passes,
so we don't have to wait in line."
420,"00:27:16,803","00:27:18,179","Wait, she's not with you?"
421,"00:27:24,393","00:27:25,394","Hey, Karen!"
422,"00:27:25,603","00:27:27,522","Hi, Claire. How's it going?"
423,"00:27:28,147","00:27:30,149","Yeah, everything's great.
The boys are having fun."
424,"00:27:30,233","00:27:32,860","Everyone's... Yeah, everyone's good."
425,"00:27:32,944","00:27:34,445","Really? Because I just hung up with Zach,"
426,"00:27:34,529","00:27:36,322","and he said that you
weren't even with them."
427,"00:27:37,782","00:27:41,911","Yeah, look. Today turned out
to be a really bad day for me."
428,"00:27:43,204","00:27:45,540","They're in great hands.
They're with my assistant."
429,"00:27:45,623","00:27:49,669","She's British, so they invented nannies."
430,"00:27:52,380","00:27:53,589","Wait, are you crying?"
431,"00:27:55,049","00:27:57,885","This was supposed to be
a family weekend, Claire."
432,"00:27:58,094","00:27:59,470",You haven't seen the boys in forever.
433,"00:27:59,679","00:28:01,764","And I know how Zach will treat
Gray if they're by themselves."
434,"00:28:01,889","00:28:03,933",And he can just be so mean.
435,"00:28:04,058","00:28:05,935","Okay, I'm sorry."
436,"00:28:07,353","00:28:09,647","Tomorrow, I'm gonna spend
the entire day with them."
437,"00:28:09,772","00:28:12,233","I'm going to take off work, and
I will not leave their side."
438,"00:28:12,316","00:28:13,484",I promise.
439,"00:28:13,568","00:28:17,029","Well, a promise tomorrow is worth
a lot less than trying today."
440,"00:28:17,154","00:28:19,949",Ew! You're using Mom's lines now?
441,"00:28:20,116","00:28:22,493","Oh, my God.
I am using Mom's lines."
442,"00:28:22,577","00:28:24,453","I'm sorry, but you know,
I have to tell you, they work."
443,"00:28:24,620","00:28:26,289",You'll see when you have kids.
444,"00:28:26,372","00:28:27,456","Yeah, ""if."""
445,"00:28:27,623","00:28:31,002","""When."" It's worth it."
446,"00:28:31,168","00:28:32,795","Bye, Mom."
447,"00:28:35,548","00:28:36,716",Bye.
448,"00:28:54,108","00:28:55,776",What do they want now?
449,"00:28:55,902","00:28:56,944",Mr. Grady?
450,"00:28:58,195","00:29:01,782","I need you to come take
a look at something."
451,"00:29:03,367","00:29:05,286",Why are you calling me Mr. Grady?
452,"00:29:05,411","00:29:06,787",Owen.
453,"00:29:08,623","00:29:09,749",If you're not too busy.
454,"00:29:09,832","00:29:10,958",I'm pretty busy.
455,"00:29:11,042","00:29:12,585",We have an attraction.
456,"00:29:12,668","00:29:14,587","That's not what you said
the last time I saw you."
457,"00:29:14,670","00:29:16,923","I'm talking about the dinosaurs, Mr. Grady."
458,"00:29:17,089","00:29:18,507",Owen.
459,"00:29:18,633","00:29:20,718",A new species we've made.
460,"00:29:23,846","00:29:26,849",You just went and made a new dinosaur?
461,"00:29:26,933","00:29:30,019","Yeah, it's kind of what we do here."
462,"00:29:30,102","00:29:31,896","The exhibit opens
to the public in three weeks."
463,"00:29:32,021","00:29:36,108","Mr. Masrani wanted me
to consult with you."
464,"00:29:36,192","00:29:40,446",You wanna consult here or in my bungalow?
465,"00:29:41,322","00:29:42,949",That's not funny.
466,"00:29:43,616","00:29:45,034",A little funny.
467,"00:29:45,201","00:29:47,995","We'd like you to evaluate
the paddock for vulnerabilities."
468,"00:29:48,079","00:29:49,705",Why me?
469,"00:29:50,247","00:29:56,504","I guess Mr. Masrani thinks, since
you're able to control the Raptors..."
470,"00:29:56,671","00:29:57,964",It's all about control with you.
471,"00:29:58,047","00:30:01,258","I don't control the Raptors.
It's a relationship."
472,"00:30:01,342","00:30:03,552",It's based on mutual respect.
473,"00:30:04,762","00:30:06,764","That's why you and I never
had a second date."
474,"00:30:06,973","00:30:09,684",Excuse me? I never wanted a second date.
475,"00:30:09,767","00:30:11,727","Who prints out an itinerary
for a night out?"
476,"00:30:11,852","00:30:13,396",I'm an organized person.
477,"00:30:13,521","00:30:16,023","What kind of a diet
doesn't allow tequila?"
478,"00:30:16,107","00:30:17,817","All of them, actually."
479,"00:30:17,900","00:30:22,279","And what kind of a man shows up
to a date in board shorts?"
480,"00:30:22,446","00:30:24,448","- It's Central America. It's hot.
- Okay. Okay."
481,"00:30:24,573","00:30:27,451","Can we just focus on the asset, please?"
482,"00:30:27,618","00:30:28,953",The asset?
483,"00:30:29,870","00:30:32,832","Look, I get it.
You're in charge out here."
484,"00:30:32,915","00:30:34,166",You gotta make a lot of tough decisions.
485,"00:30:34,250","00:30:35,584","It's probably easier
to pretend these animals"
486,"00:30:35,668","00:30:38,087",are just numbers on a spreadsheet.
487,"00:30:38,170","00:30:40,840","But they're not.
They're alive."
488,"00:30:41,590","00:30:43,592",I'm fully aware they're alive.
489,"00:30:43,718","00:30:46,387","You might have made them in a test
tube, but they don't know that."
490,"00:30:46,554","00:30:48,723","They're thinking, ""I gotta eat."
491,"00:30:49,348","00:30:52,268","""I gotta hunt. I gotta..."""
492,"00:30:54,228","00:30:57,857","You can relate to at least
one of those things."
493,"00:30:57,982","00:30:59,108",Right?
494,"00:31:02,778","00:31:03,904",I'll be in the car.
495,"00:31:07,700","00:31:10,202",You might want to change your shirt.
496,"00:31:10,286","00:31:13,497",They're very sensitive to smell.
497,"00:31:23,215","00:31:24,258",The Mosasaurus
498,"00:31:24,341","00:31:26,969","was thought to have hunted
near the surface of the water"
499,"00:31:27,094","00:31:30,306","where it preyed on anything
it could sink its teeth into,"
500,"00:31:30,431","00:31:35,978","including turtles, large fish,
even smaller Mosasaurs."
501,"00:31:36,145","00:31:40,858","Okay, folks, let's see if she's still
hungry after already eating today."
502,"00:31:41,567","00:31:45,571","She's a little shy, so be nice and
give her a hand when she comes out."
503,"00:31:45,738","00:31:47,281","Zach, Zach!"
504,"00:31:47,448","00:31:48,157",The Mosasaurus!
505,"00:32:00,503","00:32:03,047","Oh, my God!
That was awesome!"
506,"00:32:06,467","00:32:07,426",Hold on tight.
507,"00:32:07,510","00:32:11,806","We're gonna give you an even closer
look at our Mosasaurus."
508,"00:32:26,195","00:32:27,696",It had 88 teeth!
509,"00:32:29,406","00:32:31,784","- Wanna see something else cool?
- Yeah!"
510,"00:32:39,083","00:32:42,211","We've been pre-booking
tickets for months."
511,"00:32:42,419","00:32:45,131","The park needs a new
attraction every few years"
512,"00:32:45,214","00:32:47,466","in order to reinvigorate
the public's interest."
513,"00:32:47,550","00:32:49,468",Kind of like the space program.
514,"00:32:49,552","00:32:53,139","Corporate felt genetic modification
would up the wow factor."
515,"00:32:53,222","00:32:55,266","They're dinosaurs.
Wow enough."
516,"00:32:55,474","00:32:57,768",Not according to our focus groups.
517,"00:32:57,852","00:33:00,062","The Indominus rex
makes us relevant again."
518,"00:33:00,187","00:33:02,189",The Indominus rex?
519,"00:33:02,273","00:33:05,317","We needed something scary
and easy to pronounce."
520,"00:33:05,442","00:33:06,777",You should hear a four-year-old
521,"00:33:06,861","00:33:08,946","try to say ""Archaeornithomimus."""
522,"00:33:09,071","00:33:11,323",You should hear you try to say it.
523,"00:33:16,871","00:33:18,497",So what's this thing made of?
524,"00:33:19,206","00:33:23,961","The base genome is a T-Rex.
The rest is classified."
525,"00:33:24,044","00:33:26,755","You made a new dinosaur,
but you don't even know what it is?"
526,"00:33:26,839","00:33:28,799","The lab delivers us finished assets,"
527,"00:33:28,883","00:33:30,259",and we show them to the public.
528,"00:33:30,384","00:33:32,303","Can we drop a steer, please?"
529,"00:33:32,428","00:33:34,305",How long has the animal been in here?
530,"00:33:35,097","00:33:36,390",All its life.
531,"00:33:36,473","00:33:38,767","Never seen anything
outside of these walls?"
532,"00:33:38,893","00:33:40,144",We can't exactly walk it.
533,"00:33:40,269","00:33:41,812",And you feed it with that?
534,"00:33:47,109","00:33:48,819",Is there a problem?
535,"00:33:49,028","00:33:52,281","Animals raised in isolation aren't
always the most functional."
536,"00:33:53,073","00:33:55,868",Your Raptors are born in captivity.
537,"00:33:55,951","00:33:59,455","With siblings.
They learn social skills."
538,"00:33:59,538","00:34:01,165",And I imprint on them when they're born.
539,"00:34:01,332","00:34:02,583",There's trust.
540,"00:34:02,666","00:34:06,795","The only positive relationship this
animal has is with that crane."
541,"00:34:07,922","00:34:09,298",At least she knows that means food.
542,"00:34:09,423","00:34:12,301","So, she needs a friend."
543,"00:34:12,426","00:34:15,804","We should schedule play-dates?
That sort of thing?"
544,"00:34:15,971","00:34:17,723",Probably not a good idea.
545,"00:34:22,019","00:34:23,229",Where is it?
546,"00:34:23,312","00:34:24,480",Is it in the basement?
547,"00:34:24,647","00:34:27,983","Is there a downstairs?
Maybe it's in the rec room."
548,"00:34:28,150","00:34:30,319","It was just here.
We were just here."
549,"00:34:39,161","00:34:40,996","Oh, shit."
550,"00:34:43,707","00:34:45,876",That doesn't make any sense.
551,"00:34:47,670","00:34:49,797",These doors haven't been opened in weeks.
552,"00:34:51,382","00:34:53,425",Were those claw marks always there?
553,"00:34:58,847","00:34:59,848",Do you think it...
554,"00:35:03,686","00:35:05,562","Oh, God."
555,"00:35:05,729","00:35:07,356",She has an implant in her back.
556,"00:35:07,439","00:35:10,109",I can track it from the control room.
557,"00:35:19,868","00:35:21,578",We have an asset out of containment.
558,"00:35:21,704","00:35:24,331","Put ACU on alert.
This is not a drill."
559,"00:35:24,498","00:35:27,126","Even though I didn't
meet him until I was 13,"
560,"00:35:27,293","00:35:28,877",I definitely consider Carl to be
561,"00:35:28,961","00:35:30,462",more of a dad than my real dad.
562,"00:35:35,426","00:35:37,303","- Yeah, hello?
- Lowery."
563,"00:35:37,469","00:35:39,179",Get me coordinates on the Indominus.
564,"00:35:40,556","00:35:41,598","Okay, yeah."
565,"00:35:42,975","00:35:44,226",I'm doing it right now.
566,"00:36:08,334","00:36:10,377",That wall is 40 feet high.
567,"00:36:10,544","00:36:13,339","Do you really think she
could have climbed out?"
568,"00:36:13,422","00:36:15,341",It depends.
569,"00:36:15,424","00:36:16,717",On what?
570,"00:36:17,259","00:36:20,220","What kind of dinosaur
they cooked up in that lab."
571,"00:36:22,097","00:36:24,099","Wait, what the hell?"
572,"00:36:24,266","00:36:25,934",It's in the cage.
573,"00:36:26,101","00:36:28,270","No, that's impossible.
I was just there."
574,"00:36:28,354","00:36:30,230","Claire, I'm telling you,
she's in the cage."
575,"00:36:31,565","00:36:33,400",Wait a sec.
576,"00:36:33,567","00:36:34,860",There are people in there.
577,"00:36:36,945","00:36:38,781",Get them out of there now.
578,"00:36:38,864","00:36:39,865",Now!
579,"00:36:39,948","00:36:43,077","Paddock 11, this is Control. You need
to evacuate the containment area."
580,"00:36:44,161","00:36:45,496",Paddock 11.
581,"00:36:46,288","00:36:48,165","Paddock 11, do you copy?"
582,"00:36:48,665","00:36:49,666","Yeah, what's the problem?"
583,"00:36:49,833","00:36:51,460","It's in the cage!
It's in there with you!"
584,"00:36:51,627","00:36:52,461",Go!
585,"00:37:21,824","00:37:23,158",Close the door.
586,"00:37:23,325","00:37:25,411","- We can't lock him in there with that thing.
- Close it now!"
587,"00:37:25,494","00:37:26,578",Somebody talk to me!
588,"00:37:26,745","00:37:27,746",What is happening?
589,"00:37:29,123","00:37:31,166",Shit!
590,"00:39:41,088","00:39:44,466",Everyone remain calm.
591,"00:39:52,975","00:39:56,395","The implant will shock it if it gets
too close to a perimeter fence."
592,"00:39:56,603","00:39:58,063",Okay. It's moving really fast.
593,"00:39:58,146","00:39:59,982","This is Control.
Put out a park-wide alert."
594,"00:40:00,065","00:40:02,109","Hang up that damn phone, please."
595,"00:40:02,192","00:40:04,444","Sorry, I'm getting new information.
Everything's fine."
596,"00:40:04,528","00:40:06,989",Let Asset Containment capture it quietly.
597,"00:40:07,114","00:40:10,450","The very existence of this park
is predicated on our ability"
598,"00:40:10,534","00:40:12,327",to handle incidents like this.
599,"00:40:12,452","00:40:14,246","It was an eventuality, okay?"
600,"00:40:14,329","00:40:16,081",You should put that in the brochure.
601,"00:40:16,164","00:40:19,585","""Eventually, one of these
things will eat somebody."""
602,"00:40:19,668","00:40:23,046","That paddock is four miles
from the closest attraction."
603,"00:40:23,255","00:40:25,632","ACU can handle this.
No one else is gonna get..."
604,"00:40:25,841","00:40:27,217",Eaten?
605,"00:40:32,347","00:40:36,310","To all units. This is a non-lethal operation.
Understood?"
606,"00:40:43,358","00:40:44,860",How fast can they run?
607,"00:40:45,611","00:40:46,695",Forty.
608,"00:40:46,820","00:40:48,572",Fifty when they're hungry.
609,"00:40:48,655","00:40:49,656",Ooh!
610,"00:40:50,616","00:40:53,076","You ever open them up,
see what they can do?"
611,"00:40:53,660","00:40:55,162",No.
612,"00:40:55,287","00:40:56,872","Oh, shit!"
613,"00:40:56,955","00:40:59,458","That got me.
It got me."
614,"00:40:59,541","00:41:02,085","What do you think?
Want to take one home?"
615,"00:41:02,210","00:41:03,462","Hey, don't joke."
616,"00:41:04,129","00:41:05,464","When I was your age,"
617,"00:41:05,881","00:41:07,883",I rescued a wolf pup.
618,"00:41:09,384","00:41:11,887","It was, like, two months old.
It could barely walk."
619,"00:41:12,888","00:41:14,723",It used to sleep by my bed.
620,"00:41:14,890","00:41:16,099",Watch over me.
621,"00:41:17,476","00:41:20,979","My wife, she came at me
with a steak knife."
622,"00:41:21,063","00:41:22,522",It took a chunk out of her arm.
623,"00:41:23,065","00:41:24,107",Did you put him down?
624,"00:41:25,525","00:41:26,943","Hell, no."
625,"00:41:28,070","00:41:30,781","We had an unshakeable bond, you know?"
626,"00:41:30,906","00:41:32,824",Just like you and...
627,"00:41:34,409","00:41:35,619",What's his name?
628,"00:41:36,495","00:41:38,955",Delta. And she's a girl.
629,"00:41:40,040","00:41:41,041",Can I...
630,"00:41:52,386","00:41:54,304","Oh, wow."
631,"00:42:01,770","00:42:02,938",Code 19!
632,"00:42:03,188","00:42:04,356",That's the new one!
633,"00:42:04,439","00:42:05,565",They said we lost two guys!
634,"00:42:05,732","00:42:06,900",What's a Code 19?
635,"00:42:06,983","00:42:09,861","- That's Indominus!
- Asset out of containment."
636,"00:42:09,945","00:42:12,072","These people, they never learn."
637,"00:42:14,116","00:42:17,953","They're gonna learn all kinds of things
about their new asset now."
638,"00:42:20,539","00:42:25,252","Hey. Yeah, it's me.
We might have an opportunity here."
639,"00:42:43,645","00:42:45,397",You guys been here before?
640,"00:42:47,816","00:42:49,067","If Mom and Dad get divorced,"
641,"00:42:49,151","00:42:51,153","will one of us be with Mom
and the other with Dad?"
642,"00:42:51,319","00:42:53,697",What? Why would you say that?
643,"00:42:53,780","00:42:54,865",Because they are.
644,"00:42:54,948","00:42:57,909","No, they're not getting...
They're not getting divorced."
645,"00:42:58,994","00:43:01,621","Look. You haven't been around long enough.
They've always been that way."
646,"00:43:02,497","00:43:04,166",They get mail from two different lawyers.
647,"00:43:04,291","00:43:06,001",That doesn't mean anything.
648,"00:43:06,084","00:43:07,919",I googled. They're divorce lawyers.
649,"00:43:11,882","00:43:12,883","All right, whatever."
650,"00:43:13,008","00:43:15,427","You know what?
It doesn't matter, okay?"
651,"00:43:15,510","00:43:16,845",I'm gonna be gone in two years anyway.
652,"00:43:16,970","00:43:19,890","I mean, all my friends'
parents are divorced."
653,"00:43:22,267","00:43:23,769","Hey, knock it off."
654,"00:43:24,895","00:43:26,062",You're gonna cry?
655,"00:43:27,731","00:43:29,900","Look. You're gonna get
two of everything, right?"
656,"00:43:29,983","00:43:32,861","You're gonna get two birthdays,
two Thanksgivings, two..."
657,"00:43:32,944","00:43:34,863",I don't want two of everything.
658,"00:43:35,572","00:43:37,449","Yeah, well, it's not up to you."
659,"00:43:38,241","00:43:40,368","All right? There's a point
you have to grow up."
660,"00:44:11,483","00:44:13,235","I need to see a badge.
Sir, I need to see a badge."
661,"00:44:13,360","00:44:14,903","- What the hell happened out there?
- Sir."
662,"00:44:15,028","00:44:17,489","There are thermal cameras
all over that paddock."
663,"00:44:17,614","00:44:19,574",She did not just disappear!
664,"00:44:21,117","00:44:23,578","It must have been some kind
of a technical malfunction."
665,"00:44:23,662","00:44:25,163",Were you not watching?
666,"00:44:25,247","00:44:26,998",She marked up that wall as a distraction.
667,"00:44:27,082","00:44:28,625",She wanted us to think she escaped!
668,"00:44:28,708","00:44:30,585","Hold on. We are talking
about an animal here."
669,"00:44:30,710","00:44:32,838",A highly intelligent animal.
670,"00:44:32,921","00:44:34,548",400 meters to the beacon.
671,"00:44:57,904","00:45:00,115",You're going after her with non-lethals.
672,"00:45:00,198","00:45:03,869","We have $26 million invested in that asset.
We can't just kill it."
673,"00:45:04,035","00:45:05,704",Those men are gonna die.
674,"00:45:05,829","00:45:06,955",300 meters to the beacon.
675,"00:45:07,122","00:45:08,290","You need to call this
mission off right now."
676,"00:45:08,415","00:45:09,249",They're right on top of it.
677,"00:45:09,332","00:45:10,458",Call it off right now.
678,"00:45:10,625","00:45:12,544",You are not in control here!
679,"00:45:44,659","00:45:46,119",Blood's not clotted yet.
680,"00:45:46,286","00:45:47,829",It's close.
681,"00:45:48,747","00:45:50,206",What is that?
682,"00:45:51,666","00:45:54,336","That's her tracking implant.
She clawed it out."
683,"00:45:54,461","00:45:56,338",How would it know to do that?
684,"00:45:57,881","00:45:59,841",She remembered where they put it in.
685,"00:46:33,208","00:46:34,626",It can camouflage!
686,"00:47:31,349","00:47:32,892",Evacuate the island.
687,"00:47:34,269","00:47:36,021",We'd never reopen.
688,"00:47:36,104","00:47:40,608","You made a genetic hybrid,
raised it in captivity."
689,"00:47:40,692","00:47:43,403","She is seeing all of this
for the first time."
690,"00:47:43,486","00:47:46,031",She does not even know what she is.
691,"00:47:46,197","00:47:48,825",She will kill everything that moves.
692,"00:47:48,908","00:47:51,786","Do you think the animal is
contemplating its own existence?"
693,"00:47:51,870","00:47:53,496","She is learning where
she fits in the food chain,"
694,"00:47:53,663","00:47:55,707","and I'm not sure you want
her to figure that out."
695,"00:47:55,832","00:47:58,209","Now, Asset Containment
can use live ammunition"
696,"00:47:58,293","00:47:59,961",in an emergency situation.
697,"00:48:00,045","00:48:01,921",You have an M134 in your armory.
698,"00:48:02,005","00:48:03,923",Put it on a chopper and smoke this thing!
699,"00:48:04,007","00:48:05,216",We have families here.
700,"00:48:05,300","00:48:07,552","I'm not gonna turn this place
into some kind of a war zone."
701,"00:48:07,677","00:48:08,887",You already have.
702,"00:48:08,970","00:48:12,140","Mr. Grady, if you're not gonna help,
there's no reason for you to be in here."
703,"00:48:19,064","00:48:22,400","I would have a word
with your people in the lab."
704,"00:48:22,484","00:48:26,196","That thing out there, that's no dinosaur."
705,"00:48:42,462","00:48:43,505",Okay.
706,"00:48:45,298","00:48:48,510","I'm going to close everything
north of the resort."
707,"00:48:48,718","00:48:52,055","This is a Phase One, real world.
Bring everyone in."
708,"00:48:52,180","00:48:54,015","This is a Phase One, real world."
709,"00:48:54,182","00:48:55,517","I repeat, this is a Phase One."
710,"00:48:55,600","00:48:57,102",Bring everyone back in.
711,"00:48:59,938","00:49:01,106",Did you know
712,"00:49:01,189","00:49:03,733","the soft tissue is preserved
because the iron in the dinosaur's blood"
713,"00:49:03,817","00:49:06,694","generates free radicals,
and those are highly reactive."
714,"00:49:06,820","00:49:09,531","So, the proteins and the cell
membranes get all mixed up,"
715,"00:49:09,697","00:49:12,242",and act as a natural preservative.
716,"00:49:12,408","00:49:14,536",DNA can survive for millennia that way.
717,"00:49:14,661","00:49:17,372","See, now, even if the amber mines
dry up, they'll still have bones..."
718,"00:49:17,497","00:49:19,082",Shut up.
719,"00:49:21,668","00:49:24,295","What do you think's gonna happen
from you just staring at them?"
720,"00:49:27,132","00:49:28,341","Thanks, man."
721,"00:49:28,424","00:49:29,551",You're welcome.
722,"00:49:31,761","00:49:33,054",Enjoy the ride.
723,"00:49:37,433","00:49:39,519","Pregnant women and those
who suffer from motion sickness"
724,"00:49:39,602","00:49:41,896","should consult with a doctor
before riding this ride."
725,"00:49:54,492","00:49:56,035",Enjoy the ride.
726,"00:49:58,997","00:50:00,039",Hello?
727,"00:50:03,001","00:50:04,711",Seriously?
728,"00:50:06,087","00:50:08,756","Sorry, folks. The ride is closed."
729,"00:50:08,923","00:50:13,219","Everyone needs to proceed
to the monorail and exit towards the..."
730,"00:50:17,098","00:50:18,850","Come on, guys, I just work here."
731,"00:50:18,975","00:50:23,396","Due to technical difficulties,
all our exhibits are now closed."
732,"00:50:30,612","00:50:32,155",You know that I'm not at liberty
733,"00:50:32,238","00:50:35,158",to reveal the asset's genetic makeup.
734,"00:50:35,241","00:50:37,785","Modified animals are known
to be unpredictable."
735,"00:50:38,661","00:50:40,288","It's killed people, Henry."
736,"00:50:41,706","00:50:42,916",That's unfortunate.
737,"00:50:43,750","00:50:46,628","What purpose could we have
for a dinosaur that can camouflage?"
738,"00:50:47,420","00:50:48,838",Cuttlefish genes were added
739,"00:50:48,922","00:50:52,258","to help her withstand
an accelerated growth rate."
740,"00:50:52,383","00:50:57,430","Cuttlefish have chromatophores
that allow the skin to change color."
741,"00:50:57,513","00:50:59,140",It hid from thermal technology.
742,"00:51:00,475","00:51:01,559",Really?
743,"00:51:01,643","00:51:03,311",How is that possible?
744,"00:51:07,523","00:51:10,693","Tree frogs can modulate
their infrared output."
745,"00:51:10,777","00:51:14,239","We used strands from their DNA
to adapt her to a tropical climate."
746,"00:51:14,364","00:51:16,282",But I never imagined...
747,"00:51:16,366","00:51:17,533",Who authorized you to do this?
748,"00:51:18,868","00:51:19,869",You did.
749,"00:51:20,870","00:51:22,288","""Bigger."""
750,"00:51:22,455","00:51:24,290","""Scarier."" Um..."
751,"00:51:24,415","00:51:28,586","""Cooler"" I believe is the word
that you used in your memo."
752,"00:51:29,420","00:51:32,715","You cannot have an animal

761,"00:51:57,240","00:52:00,827","You are to cease all activities
here immediately."
762,"00:52:01,744","00:52:05,081","You are acting like we are engaged
in some kind of mad science."
763,"00:52:05,248","00:52:09,877","But we are doing what we have
done from the beginning."
764,"00:52:09,961","00:52:12,547",Nothing in Jurassic World is natural.
765,"00:52:12,714","00:52:16,634","We have always filled gaps in the genome
with the DNA of other animals."
766,"00:52:16,759","00:52:19,262","And, if their genetic code was pure,"
767,"00:52:19,345","00:52:20,972",many of them would look quite different.
768,"00:52:21,139","00:52:23,891","But you didn't ask for reality.
You asked for more teeth."
769,"00:52:24,017","00:52:25,018",I never asked for a monster!
770,"00:52:25,101","00:52:26,561","""Monster"" is a relative term."
771,"00:52:26,644","00:52:28,771","To a canary, a cat is a monster."
772,"00:52:30,148","00:52:32,567",We're just used to being the cat.
773,"00:52:37,071","00:52:38,614","Hey, there. I'm Jimmy Fallon."
774,"00:52:38,698","00:52:40,325","Welcome aboard the Gyrosphere,"
775,"00:52:40,408","00:52:42,952","an amazing machine made
possible by science."
776,"00:52:43,077","00:52:44,579",Your safety is our main concern.
777,"00:52:44,746","00:52:46,664","Which is why you're behind
our invisible barrier system,"
778,"00:52:46,748","00:52:49,584","which protects you from things
like Dilophosaurus venom."
779,"00:52:51,169","00:52:54,297","One drop of this can
paralyze you, so watch out."
780,"00:52:54,380","00:52:56,966",Is this real? It is?
781,"00:52:57,759","00:52:59,093","And for added protection,"
782,"00:52:59,177","00:53:02,180","each vehicle is surrounded
by aluminum oxynitride glass."
783,"00:53:02,305","00:53:05,224","So tough, it can stop a .50-caliber bullet."
784,"00:53:08,603","00:53:11,814","The Gyroscopic technology
will keep you upright at all times..."
785,"00:53:11,939","00:53:14,275","- Where are they?
- ...so you've got nothing to worry about."
786,"00:53:14,400","00:53:15,693","Oh, man."
787,"00:53:51,479","00:53:55,316","Due to technical difficulties
all our exhibits are now closed."
788,"00:53:55,483","00:53:58,236","Please disembark all rides
and return to the resort."
789,"00:54:01,531","00:54:04,242","Come on, we can stay out
a couple more minutes."
790,"00:54:04,992","00:54:06,661",But they said it was closed.
791,"00:54:06,744","00:54:08,871","Aunt Claire gave us special wristbands, right?"
792,"00:54:08,996","00:54:11,124","We're VIP, dude."
793,"00:54:11,624","00:54:14,127",Come on. It'll be fun.
794,"00:54:44,699","00:54:46,659","- Hello?
- Zara."
795,"00:54:46,868","00:54:49,078","I need you to bring the boys
back to the hotel right away."
796,"00:54:49,287","00:54:51,122","I don't know...
I've been looking everywhere for them."
797,"00:54:51,247","00:54:53,166","- It's just been quite a while.
- Slow down. I can't hear you."
798,"00:54:53,249","00:54:54,709","Zach and Gray, they've run off."
799,"00:54:54,834","00:54:56,043",They what?
800,"00:55:01,048","00:55:02,550","Hey, Claire."
801,"00:55:02,717","00:55:05,595","Zach, thank God.
Is Gray with you?"
802,"00:55:05,678","00:55:08,973","I can't really hear you.
We're in the hamster ball."
803,"00:55:09,098","00:55:10,892","Okay. Zach, listen to me."
804,"00:55:11,058","00:55:12,852",I need you to...
805,"00:55:14,187","00:55:15,188",Hello?
806,"00:55:16,397","00:55:17,607",Zach?
807,"00:55:18,816","00:55:19,817",Hmm.
808,"00:55:21,402","00:55:23,112","Are there any Gyrospheres
left in the Valley?"
809,"00:55:23,237","00:55:24,697","No, they're all accounted for.
It's my job."
810,"00:55:24,864","00:55:28,451",What? There's one in the field.
811,"00:55:28,534","00:55:30,203","Send a team of rangers, bring them in."
812,"00:55:30,286","00:55:32,205","Security, we need a search
and rescue in the Valley."
813,"00:55:32,288","00:55:35,249","It's gonna be a while.
We've got our hands full out here."
814,"00:55:35,333","00:55:37,335","No, there are two guests missing!"
815,"00:55:37,418","00:55:39,378",You need to make this your top priority!
816,"00:55:39,462","00:55:40,630","Just do it, man."
817,"00:55:40,755","00:55:42,632","There's a lot of guests missing.
We're doing the best we can."
818,"00:55:42,715","00:55:44,342","Okay. Fine.
I'll do it myself."
819,"00:55:44,467","00:55:47,303","Do you think I'm the one you need
to be worried about right now?"
820,"00:55:47,428","00:55:48,763",Back off!
821,"00:55:56,479","00:55:57,605",What happened here?
822,"00:56:01,609","00:56:03,319",Dude.
823,"00:56:03,444","00:56:04,862",Off-road.
824,"00:56:04,987","00:56:06,781",But they told us to go back.
825,"00:56:07,615","00:56:08,783",I'm just worried you're not getting
826,"00:56:08,866","00:56:11,494",the full Jurassic World experience.
827,"00:56:27,134","00:56:28,302",Claire!
828,"00:56:29,720","00:56:32,014","- I need you. I need your help.
- Okay."
829,"00:56:32,181","00:56:34,016","My nephews, they're out in the Valley."
830,"00:56:34,100","00:56:35,351","Please, if anything happens to them..."
831,"00:56:37,728","00:56:39,105",How old?
832,"00:56:40,648","00:56:44,402","The older one, he's high school age.
The younger one, he's..."
833,"00:56:44,485","00:56:45,903",He's a few years...
834,"00:56:45,987","00:56:47,238",You don't know how old your nephews are?
835,"00:56:49,490","00:56:51,409","No, no. Bad idea, bad idea."
836,"00:56:51,492","00:56:52,493",Great idea.
837,"00:56:52,577","00:56:54,370",No! We're gonna get arrested.
838,"00:56:54,495","00:56:55,538","They'll shave our heads,"
839,"00:56:55,621","00:56:57,415","and we're gonna have to make
root beer in the toilet."
840,"00:56:57,540","00:56:58,874",What are you talking about?
841,"00:57:00,376","00:57:01,419",There.
842,"00:57:03,170","00:57:04,714",You see? I told you.
843,"00:57:06,090","00:57:11,470","You're welcome. Up close and
personal with four dinosauruses."
844,"00:57:11,554","00:57:13,180",Ankylosaurus.
845,"00:57:13,389","00:57:16,726","We shouldn't be here.
And there's five dinosaurs."
846,"00:57:17,518","00:57:19,437","Aren't you supposed to be
a genius or something?"
847,"00:57:19,520","00:57:20,605",Look.
848,"00:57:20,730","00:57:22,690","One, two, three,"
849,"00:57:22,857","00:57:24,025",four.
850,"00:57:24,108","00:57:25,484",Five.
851,"00:57:37,371","00:57:38,831","- Go, go, go!
- Shit!"
852,"00:57:47,882","00:57:49,008","Hold it together, man!"
853,"00:57:57,558","00:57:59,018",Drive! Drive! Go!
854,"00:58:31,092","00:58:32,134","We're safe in here, right?"
855,"00:58:32,259","00:58:33,928",Yeah. They're totally safe.
856,"00:58:39,016","00:58:40,893",Come on.
857,"00:58:40,976","00:58:43,646","Pick up, pick up, pick up."
858,"00:58:49,777","00:58:50,778",Zach.
859,"00:58:50,861","00:58:52,405",I almost got it.
860,"00:58:52,488","00:58:53,572","- Zach?
- Yeah?"
861,"00:58:53,698","00:58:56,158","- Look.
- What?"
862,"00:59:51,172","00:59:52,339",Go! Go!
863,"00:59:57,678","00:59:59,180","Gray, go!"
864,"01:00:04,685","01:00:05,853","Oh, crap!"
865,"01:00:14,570","01:00:15,780","- We're gonna have to jump.
- I can't."
866,"01:00:15,863","01:00:18,491","Are you ready?
One, two... Come on!"
867,"01:01:09,750","01:01:11,252",You jumped.
868,"01:01:31,438","01:01:32,940",Stay in the car.
869,"01:02:03,637","01:02:04,722",Hi.
870,"01:02:05,598","01:02:06,807",Hi.
871,"01:02:19,987","01:02:22,239","I know, I know."
872,"01:02:32,166","01:02:33,709",It's all right.
873,"01:02:34,418","01:02:35,836","All right, girl."
874,"01:02:52,102","01:02:53,103",Okay.
875,"01:02:53,228","01:02:54,730","Okay, okay."
876,"01:02:56,190","01:02:57,399",You're okay.
877,"01:03:51,245","01:03:52,955",It didn't eat them.
878,"01:03:54,373","01:03:55,916",It's killing for sport.
879,"01:04:03,424","01:04:05,259","Units on standby, ready for go."
880,"01:04:05,384","01:04:07,261",Good. Hold off on that live feed.
881,"01:04:07,344","01:04:09,179",We've got an evolving situation here.
882,"01:04:09,263","01:04:11,223",Did they give you the green light yet?
883,"01:04:11,432","01:04:12,641",They will.
884,"01:04:19,231","01:04:21,692","Owen, we have a situation here."
885,"01:04:28,907","01:04:30,159","Hey, there. I'm Jimmy Fallon."
886,"01:04:30,367","01:04:31,994","Welcome aboard the Gyrosphere,"
887,"01:04:32,119","01:04:34,496","an amazing machine made
possible by science."
888,"01:04:35,330","01:04:37,374","Hey, there.
Your safety is our main concern."
889,"01:04:37,458","01:04:39,585",Now just relax and enjoy the ride.
890,"01:05:00,522","01:05:02,816","No, no, no."
891,"01:05:06,153","01:05:07,780",Hey.
892,"01:05:07,863","01:05:09,740",They made it out.
893,"01:05:22,336","01:05:24,046","Oh, my God, they jumped."
894,"01:05:24,463","01:05:25,464",Brave kids.
895,"01:05:25,672","01:05:28,133",Zach! Gray!
896,"01:05:28,300","01:05:31,178","Hey, I am not one of your damn animals."
897,"01:05:31,345","01:05:33,931","Listen, those kids are still alive,"
898,"01:05:34,014","01:05:38,393","but you and I will not be if you
continue to scream like that."
899,"01:05:39,061","01:05:40,104",So...
900,"01:05:40,896","01:05:44,775","You can pick up their scent, can't you?
Track their footprints?"
901,"01:05:44,858","01:05:46,568","I was with the Navy, not the Navajo."
902,"01:05:46,652","01:05:48,654","So then what should we do?
What do you suggest we do?"
903,"01:05:48,737","01:05:50,697","You get back.
I'll find them."
904,"01:05:50,823","01:05:53,075","No, we'll find them."
905,"01:05:53,200","01:05:54,493",You'll last two minutes in there.
906,"01:05:54,576","01:05:56,161","Less, in those ridiculous shoes."
907,"01:06:11,176","01:06:12,761",What is that supposed to mean?
908,"01:06:14,429","01:06:15,848",It means I'm ready to go.
909,"01:06:17,015","01:06:18,058",Okay.
910,"01:06:19,184","01:06:21,061","Let's get one thing straight.
I'm in charge out here."
911,"01:06:21,145","01:06:22,980","You do everything I say,
exactly as I say it."
912,"01:06:23,063","01:06:24,857","- Excuse me?
- Just relax."
913,"01:06:27,192","01:06:29,695","It's just like taking a stroll
through the woods."
914,"01:06:30,779","01:06:33,532",65 million years ago.
915,"01:07:08,817","01:07:10,194",Stay here.
916,"01:08:00,702","01:08:02,037",Wow.
917,"01:08:37,406","01:08:38,949",You still have those matches?
918,"01:08:41,326","01:08:43,078",Here you go.
919,"01:09:07,311","01:09:08,437",Gray!
920,"01:09:38,842","01:09:42,346","1992 Jeep Wrangler Sahara, Sand Beige."
921,"01:09:45,349","01:09:47,851","You remember when we fixed up
Grandpa's old Malibu, right?"
922,"01:09:48,852","01:09:50,437",Yeah.
923,"01:09:58,653","01:10:01,323","Every time this thing kills,
it moves further south."
924,"01:10:01,406","01:10:02,949",It's headed right for the park.
925,"01:10:03,116","01:10:04,201",Why would she come here?
926,"01:10:04,284","01:10:06,036",She can sense thermal radiation.
927,"01:10:06,119","01:10:07,162",Our emergency measures
928,"01:10:07,245","01:10:09,623",just put all the warm bodies in one place.
929,"01:10:11,416","01:10:12,501","- Sir...
- InGen."
930,"01:10:14,294","01:10:15,462",Hoskins.
931,"01:10:16,671","01:10:17,964",I know who you are.
932,"01:10:18,131","01:10:20,175",Then you know why I'm here.
933,"01:10:21,927","01:10:22,969",I've been working for two years
934,"01:10:23,053","01:10:24,179",on an application for those Raptors.
935,"01:10:26,723","01:10:28,850",They can hunt and kill that creature.
936,"01:10:28,975","01:10:31,228","But your program was
to test their intelligence."
937,"01:10:31,395","01:10:32,979","Yeah, it was.
And we did."
938,"01:10:33,188","01:10:36,400","And in the process, we learned something."
939,"01:10:36,566","01:10:38,985",They follow orders.
940,"01:10:39,111","01:10:41,154","You see, the solution to your crisis"
941,"01:10:41,238","01:10:42,823",is standing right in front of you.
942,"01:10:44,074","01:10:46,326",Let me be as clear as I can.
943,"01:10:47,285","01:10:50,831","No Velociraptors are going to be
set loose on this island."
944,"01:10:51,039","01:10:52,082","Oh, shit."
945,"01:10:52,833","01:10:54,376",You're out of your mind!
946,"01:10:54,459","01:10:55,585","What are you going to do
with all these people?"
947,"01:10:55,669","01:10:57,504","You got 20,000 people here.
What are you going to do?"
948,"01:10:57,671","01:10:59,840",They have no place to go.
949,"01:10:59,965","01:11:02,050",That thing is a killing machine!
950,"01:11:04,886","01:11:06,847",And it will not stop.
951,"01:11:08,390","01:11:09,683",Okay.
952,"01:11:09,850","01:11:11,643","I intend to personally
look into your project"
953,"01:11:11,726","01:11:16,606","to determine its viability within
the moral principles of this company."
954,"01:11:19,234","01:11:20,861","Okay, boss."
955,"01:11:22,904","01:11:24,406",What's your next move?
956,"01:11:33,498","01:11:35,459","Sir, I can't get a hold
of your instructor."
957,"01:11:35,667","01:11:38,712","Never mind. He's likely
caught up in the evacuation."
958,"01:11:38,920","01:11:41,214","You're sure there's nobody
else who can fly a helicopter?"
959,"01:11:43,133","01:11:45,302",We don't need anyone else.
960,"01:12:07,282","01:12:08,950",You think it's out there?
961,"01:12:14,915","01:12:19,586","I mean, I know for a fact it is
definitely not out there, all right?"
962,"01:12:19,753","01:12:21,171",We're totally safe.
963,"01:12:21,713","01:12:24,257","Here, go take this."
964,"01:12:25,759","01:12:27,594",You're stronger than me.
965,"01:12:38,939","01:12:40,190",All right. Turn it over.
966,"01:12:43,610","01:12:44,945","- Whoo!
- It works!"
967,"01:12:51,826","01:12:53,954",I thought you failed your driver's test.
968,"01:12:54,079","01:12:55,872","No, only the driving part."
969,"01:13:14,140","01:13:15,725",This one of theirs?
970,"01:13:15,809","01:13:16,851",Yeah.
971,"01:13:18,270","01:13:20,647",That road goes straight back to the park.
972,"01:13:22,607","01:13:24,985","How did they even get one
of these things started?"
973,"01:15:08,922","01:15:11,007","Lowery, we found her."
974,"01:15:11,091","01:15:12,592","South of the Gyrosphere Valley,"
975,"01:15:12,676","01:15:14,427",between the old park and the Aviary.
976,"01:15:14,594","01:15:17,222","- Wait, are you following the dinosaur?
- Yes."
977,"01:15:17,389","01:15:20,058","Get ACU out here.
Real guns this time."
978,"01:15:20,141","01:15:21,643",ACU is airborne.
979,"01:15:21,810","01:15:23,812",They took the helicopter.
980,"01:15:23,895","01:15:25,397",Who's flying it?
981,"01:15:27,899","01:15:30,110",Did you boys serve in the Armed Forces?
982,"01:15:30,318","01:15:32,153","Afghanistan, sir."
983,"01:15:32,404","01:15:35,740","Did your general ever fly
into battle with you?"
984,"01:15:36,658","01:15:37,784",Oh...
985,"01:15:38,451","01:15:41,287",Got it! Got it.
986,"01:15:42,914","01:15:45,375","We have eyes on the target,
south of the Aviary."
987,"01:15:45,500","01:15:46,668",Proceed and engage.
988,"01:15:46,835","01:15:48,962","Come on! Look alive, boys!"
989,"01:15:49,796","01:15:51,172",Look alive!
990,"01:15:59,013","01:16:01,683",10 o'clock! By the birdcage!
991,"01:16:21,870","01:16:24,456","No, no, no!"
992,"01:16:24,539","01:16:26,958",Looks like the fox got in the henhouse.
993,"01:16:44,517","01:16:46,394","Pull up! Pull up!
Up, up, up!"
994,"01:17:20,553","01:17:23,056",We have a breach in the Aviary.
995,"01:17:43,243","01:17:45,745","Trees, the trees!
Go! Go!"
996,"01:18:10,228","01:18:12,313","Okay, that's it."
997,"01:18:12,397","01:18:13,940",We're safe now.
998,"01:18:23,241","01:18:24,534","Go, go!"
999,"01:18:24,659","01:18:26,202","- Go!
- Oh, shit!"
1000,"01:18:27,787","01:18:28,788",Hurry up!
1001,"01:18:31,624","01:18:32,750",Hey!
1002,"01:18:32,834","01:18:33,835",Help!
1003,"01:18:33,918","01:18:35,253",Open the gate! Let us in!
1004,"01:18:35,378","01:18:37,046",Open it up!
1005,"01:18:37,130","01:18:38,673","- Come on!
- Come on!"
1006,"01:18:38,756","01:18:40,425",That's a first.
1007,"01:18:40,592","01:18:42,427","- Open the gate!
- Open the gate!"
1008,"01:18:42,510","01:18:43,761",Let us in!
1009,"01:18:52,437","01:18:56,441","Attention Aviary employees,
there has been a containment breach."
1010,"01:18:56,524","01:18:57,525",Hello?
1011,"01:18:57,692","01:19:00,028","Claire, we spotted
the boys on surveillance."
1012,"01:19:00,111","01:19:01,112",They're approaching the west gate.
1013,"01:19:01,237","01:19:02,238",I'm headed there now.
1014,"01:19:02,322","01:19:07,160","Okay. Stay right there. I'm on my way.
Stay right with them."
1015,"01:19:07,327","01:19:08,828",Hey!
1016,"01:19:08,953","01:19:10,288",Get on!
1017,"01:19:24,177","01:19:27,221","Ladies and gentlemen,
due to a containment anomaly"
1018,"01:19:27,388","01:19:29,515",all guests must take shelter immediately.
1019,"01:19:31,809","01:19:34,395","Ladies and gentlemen,
due to a containment anomaly"
1020,"01:19:34,520","01:19:36,940",all guests must take shelter immediately.
1021,"01:19:39,817","01:19:42,362","Ladies and gentlemen,
due to a containment anomaly"
1022,"01:19:42,570","01:19:45,365",all guests must take shelter immediately.
1023,"01:20:39,419","01:20:41,254","All units, take position on boardwalk."
1024,"01:20:41,462","01:20:44,590","Use liquid tranquilizers.
Do not fire live ammunition."
1025,"01:20:44,799","01:20:45,842","Claire, come on!"
1026,"01:21:06,237","01:21:07,697",Stop running!
1027,"01:21:20,001","01:21:21,044","- Wait.
- Ah!"
1028,"01:21:21,461","01:21:22,670",Don't just stand there!
1029,"01:22:03,169","01:22:04,837",Go! Get inside now!
1030,"01:22:21,854","01:22:22,980",Zach!
1031,"01:22:23,940","01:22:25,024",Gray!
1032,"01:22:30,029","01:22:31,364","- Aunt Claire!
- Go, go!"
1033,"01:22:31,447","01:22:32,782",Claire!
1034,"01:22:34,408","01:22:35,827",No! Hold your...
1035,"01:23:01,519","01:23:03,187",Is that Aunt Claire?
1036,"01:23:23,749","01:23:25,668",It's them! Zach!
1037,"01:23:26,878","01:23:28,129",Gray!
1038,"01:23:28,254","01:23:30,798","Oh, my God! Thank God! Thank God!
What happened? What is this?"
1039,"01:23:30,923","01:23:32,175",Are you okay?
1040,"01:23:32,258","01:23:35,970","Where did you go?
Why didn't you come back?"
1041,"01:23:36,137","01:23:38,472","- I was so worried about you.
- Who's that?"
1042,"01:23:44,604","01:23:45,771",We work together.
1043,"01:23:47,064","01:23:48,065",Hey.
1044,"01:23:49,275","01:23:50,359","- We gotta go.
- Okay."
1045,"01:23:50,443","01:23:51,777","Come on, come on."
1046,"01:23:54,488","01:23:56,365","Hey! You guys can't just
be walking up in..."
1047,"01:23:57,116","01:23:59,785",Simon Masrani's death was a tragedy.
1048,"01:24:01,120","01:24:04,790","The new mission is to prevent
further loss of life."
1049,"01:24:04,874","01:24:06,250",Who are these guys?
1050,"01:24:06,417","01:24:07,793",I'm glad you asked.
1051,"01:24:08,711","01:24:10,046",You're all relieved of duty.
1052,"01:24:10,922","01:24:13,090",There's a new team on the ground.
1053,"01:24:32,235","01:24:33,736","Lowery, I'm on my way back to you."
1054,"01:24:33,819","01:24:34,904",That's a bad idea.
1055,"01:24:35,071","01:24:36,989",The board assigned emergency ops
1056,"01:24:37,073","01:24:38,866",to InGen's private security division.
1057,"01:24:38,991","01:24:41,035",This guy Hoskins is in charge.
1058,"01:24:41,118","01:24:44,622","And he has this insane plan to use
the Raptors to hunt the Indominus."
1059,"01:24:44,705","01:24:46,666","What do you mean ""use the Raptors""?"
1060,"01:24:46,874","01:24:48,834",Son of a bitch!
1061,"01:24:50,211","01:24:51,545","You shouldn't say ""bitch."""
1062,"01:24:51,629","01:24:54,924","Take the kids.
Get them someplace safe."
1063,"01:25:11,232","01:25:13,025","- You got this!
- Go faster!"
1064,"01:25:13,109","01:25:13,901","Damn it, drive!"
1065,"01:25:20,574","01:25:22,076",This does not feel safe.
1066,"01:25:22,159","01:25:23,452",Can we stay with you?
1067,"01:25:23,536","01:25:25,538","I am never leaving you
as long as you live."
1068,"01:25:25,705","01:25:26,789","No, him."
1069,"01:25:29,208","01:25:30,626","Yeah, definitely him."
1070,"01:25:58,696","01:26:00,239",Hey! Right here.
1071,"01:26:01,532","01:26:02,867",Right here.
1072,"01:26:02,950","01:26:04,869",She looks at what she wants.
1073,"01:26:06,662","01:26:08,539",Usually what she wants to eat.
1074,"01:26:27,767","01:26:29,685",The mother hen has finally arrived.
1075,"01:26:30,436","01:26:31,437",Oh!
1076,"01:26:32,772","01:26:36,400","Get the hell out of here and
stay away from my animals."
1077,"01:26:37,151","01:26:40,237","Hoskins, you wanted this to happen,
you son of a bitch!"
1078,"01:26:40,404","01:26:41,864","Oh, Jesus!"
1079,"01:26:42,573","01:26:43,991",How many more people have to die
1080,"01:26:44,116","01:26:46,160","before this mission starts
to make sense to you?"
1081,"01:26:46,285","01:26:49,121","It's not a mission.
It's a field test."
1082,"01:26:49,246","01:26:52,666",This is an InGen situation now.
1083,"01:26:52,750","01:26:54,752","Okay, there are gonna be cruise ships"
1084,"01:26:54,835","01:26:56,670",that show up here at first light.
1085,"01:26:56,754","01:26:58,172",Everybody's gonna get off this island.
1086,"01:26:58,297","01:27:02,301","You're gonna watch a news story
tomorrow about how you all saved lives."
1087,"01:27:02,385","01:27:03,636","No, better yet,"
1088,"01:27:03,719","01:27:06,222",how your animals saved lives.
1089,"01:27:08,474","01:27:11,685","They've never been out of containment.
It's crazy."
1090,"01:27:11,811","01:27:13,479",Let's move it out!
1091,"01:27:14,063","01:27:15,940",This is happening!
1092,"01:27:16,065","01:27:18,901",With or without you.
1093,"01:27:22,571","01:27:24,907",We know that she is in sector five.
1094,"01:27:25,116","01:27:27,701","This is a game we call hide-and-seek.
It's a scent drill."
1095,"01:27:27,868","01:27:30,621","We've done it about a thousand
times with these animals."
1096,"01:27:30,704","01:27:34,166","When they get on target,
and they will get on target,"
1097,"01:27:34,333","01:27:36,335",wait to engage.
1098,"01:27:36,419","01:27:38,921",Velociraptors are pack hunters.
1099,"01:27:39,004","01:27:41,632",They like to herd the animal into a kill zone.
1100,"01:27:41,715","01:27:42,967",That's when we take our shot.
1101,"01:27:43,175","01:27:44,844","Get a clear shot, wait on my command,"
1102,"01:27:44,927","01:27:46,554",and give her everything you got.
1103,"01:27:46,762","01:27:50,808","We got one good target, gentlemen.
Do not shoot my Raptors."
1104,"01:27:52,059","01:27:53,185",Please.
1105,"01:27:53,727","01:27:55,563","Easy, Blue."
1106,"01:27:56,689","01:27:58,107",Easy.
1107,"01:27:59,483","01:28:00,734",Attagirl.
1108,"01:28:03,446","01:28:05,322",You don't scare me.
1109,"01:28:05,489","01:28:06,699",Owen.
1110,"01:28:10,911","01:28:11,954",Are they safe?
1111,"01:28:13,914","01:28:14,915","No, they're not."
1112,"01:28:15,875","01:28:17,751",What are their names?
1113,"01:28:17,835","01:28:19,253","Well, you got Charlie."
1114,"01:28:19,920","01:28:22,047","There's Echo.
Here is Delta."
1115,"01:28:22,840","01:28:25,718","This one's called Blue.
She's the beta."
1116,"01:28:26,635","01:28:27,720",Who's the alpha?
1117,"01:28:27,887","01:28:29,430","You're looking at him, kid."
1118,"01:28:35,060","01:28:36,353",See?
1119,"01:28:36,437","01:28:37,897",Totally safe.
1120,"01:28:38,898","01:28:40,900","All right, get in. Come on."
1121,"01:28:41,066","01:28:42,318",Get in there.
1122,"01:28:44,737","01:28:47,573","If you need me, I'll be right up front."
1123,"01:28:47,656","01:28:48,949",Just open that window.
1124,"01:28:49,992","01:28:50,993",Okay?
1125,"01:28:51,660","01:28:52,786",Put your seatbelts on.
1126,"01:28:57,082","01:28:59,043","Okay, so just..."
1127,"01:29:00,211","01:29:01,504",Hold hands.
1128,"01:29:19,271","01:29:20,272",Um...
1129,"01:29:20,940","01:29:23,108","Nothing's getting in here, right?"
1130,"01:29:26,320","01:29:27,363",Hey.
1131,"01:29:29,573","01:29:31,575","Do you remember that ghost
at the old house?"
1132,"01:29:31,659","01:29:33,452","Remember, the one in the garage?"
1133,"01:29:35,538","01:29:37,331","I protected you, right?"
1134,"01:29:39,625","01:29:42,628","You made a battle axe
out of a ruler and a paper plate."
1135,"01:29:43,420","01:29:44,964",Yeah.
1136,"01:29:45,047","01:29:47,883","See, nothing is gonna get you
while I'm around, okay?"
1137,"01:29:48,801","01:29:51,220",But you're not always gonna be around.
1138,"01:29:52,429","01:29:53,889","Yeah, well..."
1139,"01:29:54,640","01:29:55,975",Hey...
1140,"01:29:56,892","01:29:59,144","We're brothers, okay?"
1141,"01:29:59,353","01:30:02,982","We'll always be brothers, and we'll
always come back to one another."
1142,"01:30:05,442","01:30:06,527",No matter what.
1143,"01:30:07,861","01:30:08,862",No matter what?
1144,"01:30:09,697","01:30:10,990",No matter what.
1145,"01:30:33,345","01:30:34,847",Awesome.
1146,"01:30:47,693","01:30:48,986",Here we go.
1147,"01:32:00,557","01:32:02,393",Your boyfriend's a badass.
1148,"01:32:15,614","01:32:18,492","Imagine if we had these
puppies in Tora Bora."
1149,"01:32:20,994","01:32:21,995",Are you recording this thing?
1150,"01:32:34,800","01:32:36,135",They're slowing down.
1151,"01:32:37,469","01:32:38,804",They got something.
1152,"01:32:57,573","01:32:58,615","You know what?
No, no, no."
1153,"01:32:58,699","01:33:00,159",You guys are not gonna watch this.
1154,"01:33:00,242","01:33:01,493",Keep the window closed.
1155,"01:33:37,946","01:33:39,364",Something's wrong.
1156,"01:33:40,240","01:33:41,617",They're communicating.
1157,"01:33:49,208","01:33:52,294","I know why they wouldn't
tell us what it's made of."
1158,"01:33:52,377","01:33:53,378",Why?
1159,"01:33:58,217","01:34:00,302",That thing's part Raptor.
1160,"01:34:07,476","01:34:09,895","What's taking them so long?
Light it up!"
1161,"01:34:09,978","01:34:11,313",Engage!
1162,"01:34:25,869","01:34:27,412","Oh, my God."
1163,"01:34:38,715","01:34:40,050",Watch your six.
1164,"01:34:40,926","01:34:42,553",Raptors got a new alpha.
1165,"01:36:04,092","01:36:06,386",To the vehicles now!
1166,"01:36:06,511","01:36:08,597",Fall back!
1167,"01:36:26,740","01:36:28,200",No!
1168,"01:36:30,118","01:36:32,079",No! Blue!
1169,"01:36:46,301","01:36:47,552","Oh, my God."
1170,"01:36:48,136","01:36:50,222",Is everybody dead?
1171,"01:36:50,389","01:36:52,140","No, no, no. Everyone is fine."
1172,"01:36:52,224","01:36:53,517",Don't lie to him.
1173,"01:36:53,600","01:36:56,019","He's scared. It's okay to lie
when people are scared."
1174,"01:36:56,103","01:36:58,105",I wanna go home.
1175,"01:36:58,230","01:37:00,607","Sweetheart, you will, okay?
I promise."
1176,"01:37:00,732","01:37:02,609","Tomorrow you will be home,"
1177,"01:37:02,734","01:37:05,487","and your mother will never
let me see you again."
1178,"01:37:05,612","01:37:07,406",Get out of here! Go!
1179,"01:37:12,119","01:37:14,037",They're coming!
1180,"01:37:24,131","01:37:26,258",Just hold on back there.
1181,"01:38:15,307","01:38:16,641","- Turn it on.
- I don't know how."
1182,"01:38:23,815","01:38:24,983",Now!
1183,"01:38:30,155","01:38:31,823",Are you boys okay?
1184,"01:38:31,907","01:38:33,575",Did you see that?
1185,"01:38:33,658","01:38:35,452",I can't wait to tell Mom.
1186,"01:38:35,535","01:38:38,663","Please, no. Do not tell your
mother about that, ever."
1187,"01:38:41,750","01:38:43,168","- Owen!
- Owen!"
1188,"01:38:48,006","01:38:50,967","We gotta get indoors.
Follow me."
1189,"01:38:56,181","01:38:59,392","Lowery, we're headed your way.
Call in a chopper."
1190,"01:39:12,531","01:39:15,033",Everything must be accounted for.
1191,"01:39:15,117","01:39:17,285",I want all backup generators online.
1192,"01:39:23,500","01:39:24,501",Where have you been?
1193,"01:39:24,668","01:39:27,879","Change of plans.
Mission took a jog to the left."
1194,"01:39:28,088","01:39:29,214",I'm taking everything off-site.
1195,"01:39:29,381","01:39:30,715",The embryos are safe here.
1196,"01:39:30,841","01:39:33,176","They can live up to eight
weeks on the generators."
1197,"01:39:33,260","01:39:36,847","No, no. You listen. The park's
gonna be Chapter 11 by morning."
1198,"01:39:36,972","01:39:38,598",Okay? Our little side project's
1199,"01:39:38,682","01:39:39,683",about to get a shot in the arm.
1200,"01:39:39,850","01:39:40,809",I don't want a bunch of lawyers
1201,"01:39:40,892","01:39:43,478","messing around with something
that they don't understand."
1202,"01:39:43,562","01:39:44,729",You get it?
1203,"01:39:45,480","01:39:46,481",Hey?
1204,"01:39:46,648","01:39:48,567",I'm gonna take that as a yes.
1205,"01:39:50,402","01:39:53,738","Ladies and gentlemen, we'd like
to thank you for your patience."
1206,"01:39:53,947","01:39:57,450","The next ferry will be
leaving in 45 minutes."
1207,"01:39:57,617","01:40:00,495","If you require immediate
medical attention,"
1208,"01:40:00,579","01:40:02,914","please report to the nearest
health service station."
1209,"01:40:02,998","01:40:04,249",Is this what you had in mind?
1210,"01:40:04,332","01:40:07,544","Okay, people. We have an extraction
point at the east dock."
1211,"01:40:10,714","01:40:11,715",Hey.
1212,"01:40:11,798","01:40:14,134","They said we had to evacuate.
There's a boat."
1213,"01:40:14,301","01:40:16,219",You coming?
1214,"01:40:23,768","01:40:25,854",Someone has to stay behind.
1215,"01:40:30,650","01:40:32,569","Oh, no. I have a boyfriend."
1216,"01:40:33,612","01:40:36,531","I didn't know that you guys were,
like, together-together."
1217,"01:40:36,615","01:40:37,699",We are.
1218,"01:40:37,782","01:40:40,285","That's good. You don't mention him, ever."
1219,"01:40:40,452","01:40:41,536","No, I'm at work."
1220,"01:40:41,745","01:40:43,079","No, no, no. Yeah."
1221,"01:40:43,914","01:40:46,208","- Well...
- Yeah, okay."
1222,"01:40:46,291","01:40:47,292","- Great.
- Great."
1223,"01:40:47,375","01:40:48,376","- Okay.
- Okay."
1224,"01:40:48,460","01:40:49,669","- Are you gonna be okay?
- Yeah."
1225,"01:40:50,462","01:40:52,005","Okay, bye."
1226,"01:41:00,347","01:41:02,224",Where's Hoskins?
1227,"01:41:02,307","01:41:04,643","He's sending you and the assets
to a secure location."
1228,"01:41:04,726","01:41:07,020",But our deal is still intact?
1229,"01:41:07,103","01:41:10,023","Don't worry. You'll be well
taken care of. Let's go!"
1230,"01:41:17,113","01:41:19,282",Thank you for visiting Jurassic World.
1231,"01:41:19,449","01:41:21,576",We hope you enjoyed your adventure.
1232,"01:41:21,660","01:41:24,287","Don't forget to visit the gift shop,
and remember..."
1233,"01:41:24,496","01:41:27,832",It's always happy hour at Margaritaville.
1234,"01:41:31,211","01:41:33,797","Come on, come on.
Go inside."
1235,"01:41:41,346","01:41:42,973","Control room.
That way."
1236,"01:41:53,191","01:41:55,610",They evacuated the lab.
1237,"01:42:36,026","01:42:37,569",What are you doing?
1238,"01:42:37,777","01:42:40,989","I'm afraid that's above your
pay grade, honey."
1239,"01:42:41,906","01:42:43,116",Where's Henry?
1240,"01:42:44,075","01:42:45,910","Dr. Wu, he works for us."
1241,"01:42:47,078","01:42:48,705",That's not a real dinosaur.
1242,"01:42:49,789","01:42:52,292","No, it ain't, kid."
1243,"01:42:53,752","01:42:56,713","But somebody's gotta make sure
that this company has a future."
1244,"01:42:57,422","01:42:58,506","Imagine,"
1245,"01:42:59,299","01:43:02,844","that one, a fraction of the size,"
1246,"01:43:02,927","01:43:05,347","deadly, intelligent,"
1247,"01:43:05,430","01:43:09,267","able to hide from the most
advanced military technology."
1248,"01:43:09,434","01:43:12,854","A living weapon unlike anything
we've ever seen."
1249,"01:43:12,937","01:43:13,897",You see...
1250,"01:43:13,980","01:43:18,026","Millions of years of evolution,
what did we learn?"
1251,"01:43:20,153","01:43:22,572",Nature is the gift that just...
1252,"01:43:22,739","01:43:24,115","Oh, shit!"
1253,"01:43:27,327","01:43:28,620",Easy.
1254,"01:43:29,621","01:43:31,539","Easy, boy."
1255,"01:43:31,623","01:43:33,875","Easy. Hey, hey."
1256,"01:43:36,127","01:43:39,964","We're on the same side, right? Right?"
1257,"01:43:41,633","01:43:43,385",Easy.
1258,"01:43:43,468","01:43:44,469",Easy.
1259,"01:43:46,137","01:43:47,764",I'm on your side.
1260,"01:43:56,856","01:43:58,233","No, boys. Boys, this way.
Come on."
1261,"01:43:58,316","01:43:59,651",Come on. Come on.
1262,"01:44:35,645","01:44:37,021",That's how it is?
1263,"01:44:53,204","01:44:55,373",Easy. Easy.
1264,"01:44:59,711","01:45:00,712",Easy.
1265,"01:45:11,055","01:45:12,390",That's it.
1266,"01:46:22,210","01:46:23,962","24, 50."
1267,"01:46:24,963","01:46:26,005",We need more.
1268,"01:46:27,840","01:46:28,967",More what?
1269,"01:46:29,050","01:46:30,093",Teeth.
1270,"01:46:30,218","01:46:31,719",We need more teeth.
1271,"01:46:41,521","01:46:44,148","Okay, so you just wait here."
1272,"01:46:45,567","01:46:46,609",It's gonna be fine.
1273,"01:47:35,283","01:47:36,743","Lowery, are you still there?"
1274,"01:47:37,577","01:47:38,536","Hey, where are you?"
1275,"01:47:38,703","01:47:40,580",I need you to open Paddock 9.
1276,"01:47:41,372","01:47:42,540",Paddock 9?
1277,"01:47:44,500","01:47:45,251",You kidding?
1278,"01:47:50,506","01:47:53,593","Damn it, Lowery, be a man and do
something for once in your life."
1279,"01:47:53,676","01:47:55,803",Why do you have to make it personal?
1280,"01:50:10,480","01:50:11,814",Run!
1281,"01:50:12,774","01:50:14,108","Go! Go, go!"
1282,"01:53:42,400","01:53:45,194","Oh, my God, it's your parents.
It's your parents."
1283,"01:53:47,071","01:53:48,280","Come on, come on."
1284,"01:53:52,243","01:53:54,704","Are you okay?
Oh, baby."
1285,"01:54:03,754","01:54:05,589",I'm so sorry.
1286,"01:54:07,550","01:54:09,093",Are you okay?
1287,"01:54:13,431","01:54:14,682",Come here.
1288,"01:54:16,350","01:54:17,893",Sweetie.
1289,"01:54:35,161","01:54:36,662","So, what do we do now?"
1290,"01:54:38,289","01:54:40,166",Probably stick together.
1291,"01:54:42,084","01:54:43,502",For survival.
