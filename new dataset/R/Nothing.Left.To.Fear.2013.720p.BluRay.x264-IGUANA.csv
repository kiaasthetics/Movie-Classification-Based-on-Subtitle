Pastor Kingsman said..."
2,"00:02:31,735","00:02:34,204","you take a...
off the turnpike, six miles on..."
3,"00:02:34,363","00:02:36,582","- He doesn't know.
- I didn't think so."
4,"00:02:36,740","00:02:38,541","What's it called...
the first road? Lime Road?"
5,"00:02:38,617","00:02:40,961","- Old Lime Road.
- Rebecca, help your dad out here."
6,"00:02:41,119","00:02:43,247",Rebecca.
7,"00:02:43,413","00:02:45,415",I think we're lost.
8,"00:02:48,168","00:02:49,920","- Sorry, Dad.
- Okay. All right."
9,"00:02:50,087","00:02:51,648","- I saw these before.
- Saw what?"
10,"00:02:51,797","00:02:53,891","This. It all looks the same.
I don't know."
11,"00:02:54,049","00:02:55,729","If you took the right,
left at the right..."
12,"00:02:55,801","00:02:57,921","- You can't even hit me back.
- ... at the right barn."
13,"00:02:58,011","00:02:59,888","Or was it the left, left
at the right barn?"
14,"00:03:00,055","00:03:02,274","Do you remember
when he took the wrong exit?"
15,"00:03:02,432","00:03:03,979","- Right?
- We ended up going..."
16,"00:03:04,142","00:03:05,862","- No, no, that's not...
- Twice."
17,"00:03:05,936","00:03:07,537","- No, that's not true.
- He did it twice."
18,"00:03:07,604","00:03:09,197","- It was not properly marked.
- He did it twice."
19,"00:03:09,356","00:03:11,316","- It was not properly marked.
- You circled twice."
20,"00:03:13,944","00:03:15,617","Okay, ha-ha.
Listen, this is..."
21,"00:03:15,779","00:03:17,952",that was the right barn.
22,"00:03:18,115","00:03:19,875","I'm pretty sure
that this was the right road."
23,"00:03:19,991","00:03:21,459","Well, I mean,"
24,"00:03:21,618","00:03:24,918","it's not that I don't trust your
keen sense of judgment, Captain,"
25,"00:03:25,080","00:03:27,799","but why don't we just
stop and ask?"
26,"00:03:29,793","00:03:31,636",There's an idea.
27,"00:03:31,795","00:03:33,593","Come on, ask, ask."
28,"00:03:33,755","00:03:35,632","Ask, ask, ask, ask."
29,"00:03:35,799","00:03:37,801","Ask, ask ask."
30,"00:03:37,968","00:03:40,187","I'm gonna go in here
and check it out."
31,"00:03:41,346","00:03:43,974","- I listen to my family.
- Wrong turn."
32,"00:03:44,141","00:03:47,315","Is there... is there...
is there a fellow there?"
33,"00:03:47,477","00:03:49,946","Oh, my God."
34,"00:03:50,105","00:03:52,449","Oh, my God."
35,"00:03:58,280","00:04:00,157",That's enough.
36,"00:04:00,323","00:04:02,417",Whew!
37,"00:04:02,576","00:04:04,169",Hallelujah!
38,"00:04:04,327","00:04:06,671","All right,
there is a word I like to hear."
39,"00:04:06,830","00:04:10,255","Let's be saying it
when we find out where we are."
40,"00:04:12,294","00:04:14,672","Oh, that's nice.
Isn't that pretty?"
41,"00:04:16,423","00:04:18,471","For the tenth time
that we've seen it today."
42,"00:04:18,633","00:04:20,226",I know.
43,"00:04:20,385","00:04:22,353","Sorry, Dan."
44,"00:04:22,512","00:04:24,514",I'll go up and check.
45,"00:04:25,849","00:04:27,529","- Okay, Christopher.
- Take the boy."
46,"00:04:27,642","00:04:29,861","- Let's go.
- Dad."
47,"00:04:30,020","00:04:31,863",See you in a minute.
48,"00:04:32,022","00:04:33,899",Good luck.
49,"00:04:42,282","00:04:44,455","Something tells me
this town won't have a mall."
50,"00:04:44,618","00:04:46,495",A mall?
51,"00:04:46,661","00:04:49,710","Come on, I'll settle
for indoor bathrooms."
52,"00:05:04,095","00:05:06,097",Hello?
53,"00:05:10,894","00:05:12,942",Hello! Anyone here?
54,"00:05:18,693","00:05:20,695",Hello!
55,"00:05:39,548","00:05:41,801","Excuse me.
You folks looking for something?"
56,"00:05:41,967","00:05:45,267","Sorry. Yeah, we saw
your farm here and..."
57,"00:05:45,428","00:05:46,771",You lost or something?
58,"00:05:46,930","00:05:50,059","Well, to be honest,
I think we may be a little lost."
59,"00:05:50,225","00:05:52,603","There's a gas station a couple
miles back the way you came."
60,"00:05:52,769","00:05:54,567",You can get a map from them.
61,"00:05:54,729","00:05:57,824","Okay. I was just... I was just
looking for a town called Stull."
62,"00:05:57,983","00:06:01,237","I think we took a wrong turn
a mile or so back."
63,"00:06:01,403","00:06:03,803","So we'll get out of your hair.
Sorry for having bothered you."
64,"00:06:03,822","00:06:06,450","You wouldn't be
the new pastor, would you?"
65,"00:06:06,616","00:06:09,745","Well, actually, yes.
How did you know that?"
66,"00:06:09,911","00:06:12,630","Well, Pastor Kingsman asked me
to keep an eye out for you,"
67,"00:06:12,789","00:06:14,917",make sure you're okay.
68,"00:06:15,083","00:06:17,882","I'm just so glad
that you made it, Pastor."
69,"00:06:18,044","00:06:19,564","I was starting to get
a little worried."
70,"00:06:19,588","00:06:21,215","Your moving truck passed by
a couple of hours ago."
71,"00:06:21,381","00:06:23,509","Oh, that's good to hear."
72,"00:06:23,675","00:06:25,715","I know my wife will certainly
be happy to hear that."
73,"00:06:25,802","00:06:27,349",Are we far from town?
74,"00:06:27,512","00:06:31,813","Oh, no, no, not at all,
just a couple of miles or so."
75,"00:06:31,975","00:06:34,819","I'm Pastor Dan Bramford.
Nice to meet you."
76,"00:06:34,978","00:06:36,821","This is my son Christopher.
Christopher."
77,"00:06:36,980","00:06:39,324","Oh, got a good QTâ€œ)
on you, boy ."
78,"00:06:39,482","00:06:41,234",Yeah.
79,"00:06:41,401","00:06:44,496",I'm... I'm Mason.
80,"00:06:44,654","00:06:46,327",Nice to meet you.
81,"00:06:46,489","00:06:48,036",I'll just...
82,"00:06:48,199","00:06:50,668","I'll just bring my truck around.
You can follow me."
83,"00:06:50,827","00:06:52,500","Okay, that's great."
84,"00:06:52,662","00:06:54,164",I told you we weren't lost.
85,"00:07:16,645","00:07:18,443",Hey! Honey!
86,"00:07:18,605","00:07:20,903",Welcome to Stull!
87,"00:07:21,066","00:07:22,659","Oh, no.
You gotta be kidding me."
88,"00:07:22,817","00:07:25,866","Give me five.
I got you here."
89,"00:07:26,029","00:07:27,872",You did it.
90,"00:07:28,031","00:07:30,875",I hate to say I told you so.
91,"00:07:31,034","00:07:32,914","- All right.
- He's gonna come by with the truck"
92,"00:07:32,994","00:07:34,541","and pick us up,
show us into town."
93,"00:07:44,339","00:07:46,888","Oh, my God, what the hell
is that guy doing?"
94,"00:07:47,050","00:07:48,768",I don't know.
95,"00:08:19,416","00:08:22,420","Oh. Oh, yuck."
96,"00:08:22,585","00:08:25,259","Well, that is just not appropriate
for you to see."
97,"00:08:25,422","00:08:27,095","- Eww.
- You, too."
98,"00:08:27,257","00:08:30,352","- In the car. In the car.
- Come on, guys."
99,"00:08:32,262","00:08:34,185","- Are you folks ready?
- Yeah, we are."
100,"00:08:34,347","00:08:36,475","I'll just drive right up there
and wait for you."
101,"00:08:36,641","00:08:38,609","Thank you, Mason."
102,"00:08:38,768","00:08:41,942","All right, kids just got
their first taste of the country."
103,"00:08:57,245","00:08:59,623",We won't need these anymore.
104,"00:09:03,501","00:09:05,421","It's not as small
as you thought it was, Rebecca."
105,"00:09:05,462","00:09:08,056","- This is Main Street?
- What's that?"
106,"00:09:08,214","00:09:10,137","- Ice cream?
- Look."
107,"00:09:10,300","00:09:14,055",Christopher wants to go there.
108,"00:09:29,319","00:09:32,323","- Is that us?
- I think."
109,"00:09:33,573","00:09:35,667","- Is that us right there?
- This is..."
110,"00:09:35,825","00:09:37,345","- Is that it? Oh!
- Are you kidding me?"
111,"00:09:37,410","00:09:38,536","- That's it.
- Oh."
112,"00:09:38,703","00:09:40,705","- Can you believe it?
- Ma'am, I'm sorry"
113,"00:09:40,872","00:09:42,920","I didn't get a chance to meet you
back at the farm, but I'm Mason."
114,"00:09:43,083","00:09:44,960","Oh, I'm Wendy."
115,"00:09:45,126","00:09:46,846","- This is gorgeous.
- Oh my goodness."
116,"00:09:46,920","00:09:48,638",I'm glad you like it.
117,"00:09:48,797","00:09:50,891","I'm just glad I showed you
where it was."
118,"00:09:51,049","00:09:52,926","Oh, my."
119,"00:09:53,093","00:09:56,347","Can you... what's...
it's amazing."
120,"00:09:57,555","00:09:59,478","Um, hi. Hi."
121,"00:09:59,641","00:10:01,609",Excuse me.
122,"00:10:01,768","00:10:03,987",Be careful.
123,"00:10:09,234","00:10:12,033","Becky... uh, Rebecca."
124,"00:10:12,195","00:10:14,448","It's okay, Dad.
You can still call me Becky."
125,"00:10:14,614","00:10:17,709",It's... it's really nice.
126,"00:10:17,867","00:10:19,369",Yeah.
127,"00:10:20,703","00:10:22,455",Big change.
128,"00:10:22,622","00:10:24,624","I know that you are gonna
make the most of it."
129,"00:10:24,791","00:10:26,509","Excuse me. Hi.
Thank you."
130,"00:10:26,668","00:10:28,295",I gotta go help your mom.
131,"00:10:28,461","00:10:29,929","I... I'm sorry.
Can you help me?"
132,"00:10:30,088","00:10:31,808","I'm so confused.
Where are the movers and..."
133,"00:10:31,881","00:10:33,724",Let me help you.
134,"00:10:33,883","00:10:35,476",I don't know what's going on.
135,"00:10:35,635","00:10:37,387","Did the movers just leave
everything on the ground?"
136,"00:10:37,554","00:10:39,101","No, no, no, they were nice fellows.
We just figured"
137,"00:10:39,264","00:10:41,232","you didn't want any strangers
traipsing through your house."
138,"00:10:41,391","00:10:42,992","Some fellows from church
came by to help."
139,"00:10:43,059","00:10:44,902","- Pastor Kingsman.
- Oh, Pastor Bramford."
140,"00:10:45,061","00:10:46,608","- How are you?
- Good. Good."
141,"00:10:46,771","00:10:48,372","I thought you were a mover.
I'm so sorry."
142,"00:10:48,398","00:10:50,366","Well, today I'm a mover.
Who knows what I'll be tomorrow?"
143,"00:10:50,525","00:10:54,371","I know I speak for everybody when I say
we're awfully glad you're here."
144,"00:10:54,529","00:10:56,281","- Thank you.
- Well, I think six states,"
145,"00:10:56,447","00:10:58,290","three children,
countless rest stops..."
146,"00:10:58,449","00:11:01,578","- I think no one's happier than we are.
- I expect that's true."
147,"00:11:01,744","00:11:03,963","- Here, Dan.
- Sure."
148,"00:11:04,122","00:11:05,749","- Fragile.
- Yeah, should we?"
149,"00:11:05,915","00:11:07,713","- Dining room?
- Dining room, gents."
150,"00:11:07,876","00:11:10,595","- All right, let's go.
- You be the captain out there."
151,"00:11:10,753","00:11:12,380","Captain, I know.
Thank you."
152,"00:11:14,424","00:11:17,553","Oh, yeah. Excuse me,
I think that goes into the living room."
153,"00:11:17,719","00:11:19,972","Thank you.
Hi, sweetheart."
154,"00:11:20,138","00:11:22,311","- Hi.
- Can you believe it?"
155,"00:11:22,473","00:11:24,942","Um, kitchen.
Thank you."
156,"00:11:28,188","00:11:29,735",Okay
157,"00:11:31,191","00:11:33,489","- Can you believe it?
- This place is so nice."
158,"00:11:33,651","00:11:36,279","- This place is huge.
- I know, right?"
159,"00:11:36,446","00:11:39,040","- Mom, can I pick out my room?
- Well, yes, after your sisters,"
160,"00:11:39,199","00:11:41,122","'cause they're older than you,
so they get first choice."
161,"00:11:41,284","00:11:43,161","- First choice?
- First choice."
162,"00:11:43,328","00:11:45,489","- Second choice.
- Hey, girls, Christopher,"
163,"00:11:45,496","00:11:47,339","please say hello
to Pastor Kingsman."
164,"00:11:47,498","00:11:49,091","The man responsible
for all of this."
165,"00:11:49,250","00:11:51,344","Oh, well, I wouldn't say
I'm responsible."
166,"00:11:51,502","00:11:54,005","I think a higher power
called you to our little town."
167,"00:11:54,172","00:11:55,640","Well, certainly.
Thank you."
168,"00:11:55,798","00:11:57,800","It's nice to meet you, girls."
169,"00:11:57,967","00:11:59,685","- Nice to meet you.
- Go. Get up there."
170,"00:11:59,844","00:12:01,972","- Stop pushing me.
- I'll help."
171,"00:12:02,138","00:12:04,061",Stop.
172,"00:12:08,686","00:12:10,438","- I like the window in here.
- This room is cool."
173,"00:12:10,605","00:12:12,699",I saw it first. I call dibs.
174,"00:12:12,857","00:12:14,074",You heard what Mom said.
175,"00:12:14,234","00:12:15,954","I'm older than you.
I get first dibs, kiddo."
176,"00:12:16,110","00:12:17,987",Second dibs.
177,"00:12:18,154","00:12:20,202","Second's better
than the third, you weirdo."
178,"00:12:20,365","00:12:23,414","What?
You didn't get the crappy third one."
179,"00:13:13,376","00:13:16,129","Damn it.
Let me guess."
180,"00:13:16,296","00:13:18,344",Yep. Mine.
181,"00:13:46,868","00:13:47,869",Mom!
182,"00:13:48,036","00:13:50,710","Oh, thank you so much."
183,"00:13:50,872","00:13:54,627","This is incredible.
Everybody's so... so sweet."
184,"00:13:54,792","00:13:57,261","- And this kitchen is amazing.
- Well, I'm glad you like it."
185,"00:13:57,420","00:13:59,673","I'm not much of a cook myself,
so I have to take your word for it."
186,"00:13:59,839","00:14:01,716","- That's not your handiwork?
- Oh, no, no, no."
187,"00:14:01,883","00:14:03,931","- That's... that's Mrs. Gordon's.
- Oh."
188,"00:14:04,093","00:14:06,562","She... she's pretty famous
for her cakes around here."
189,"00:14:06,721","00:14:08,598","- Looks delicious.
- They're good."
190,"00:14:08,765","00:14:11,518","Yeah, melt your tongue
right off."
191,"00:14:11,684","00:14:13,937","So, Dan,"
192,"00:14:14,103","00:14:15,863","what do you say
we rip the Band-Aid right off"
193,"00:14:15,938","00:14:17,458","and get you up
on that pulpit tomorrow?"
194,"00:14:17,607","00:14:19,484","- Oh. Oh. Oh.
- Oh my goodness, Dan."
195,"00:14:19,650","00:14:22,699","- I'm not sure that I'm ready.
- I know it's quick,"
196,"00:14:22,862","00:14:24,703","but folks are anxious
to meet their new pastor."
197,"00:14:24,739","00:14:26,912","Well, you know,
he's got big shoes to fill."
198,"00:14:27,075","00:14:28,952","- I'm sure they're gonna miss you a lot.
- No, no, no."
199,"00:14:29,118","00:14:32,247","I've been here a number of years.
They're about ready to see me move on."
200,"00:14:32,413","00:14:35,508","- No.
- I'm looking forward to retirement."
201,"00:14:35,666","00:14:38,510","I think it's about time
we had some new blood around here."
202,"00:14:38,669","00:14:40,717","- Oh.
- Well..."
203,"00:14:40,880","00:14:43,349","- Come on, sweetie.
- What do you say?"
204,"00:14:43,508","00:14:45,010",Rip the Band-Aid right off.
205,"00:14:45,176","00:14:46,803","- Huh?
- All right."
206,"00:15:00,817","00:15:02,990",How's the sermon going?
207,"00:15:03,152","00:15:05,154","Oh, fine. Good."
208,"00:15:05,321","00:15:07,995",The usual battle.
209,"00:15:08,157","00:15:09,500",How are the girls?
210,"00:15:09,659","00:15:11,661",They're good.
211,"00:15:12,995","00:15:14,838","You did the right thing,
you know."
212,"00:15:14,997","00:15:17,671",The house is perfect.
213,"00:15:17,834","00:15:21,008","I'm almost finished unpacking
downstairs. It looks so good."
214,"00:15:22,713","00:15:25,011",I'm glad you're happy with it.
215,"00:15:25,174","00:15:27,848","I think moving is always
hardest on the children."
216,"00:15:28,010","00:15:30,729","- Yes, I know.
- The new school, the new friends."
217,"00:15:30,888","00:15:33,311","They'll adjust.
You know they will."
218,"00:15:33,474","00:15:36,023",I think they're gonna like it.
219,"00:15:37,520","00:15:39,363","It's not like we had
that much of a choice."
220,"00:15:39,522","00:15:41,399","- No?
- No."
221,"00:15:41,566","00:15:43,443","- We have a bigger boss.
- Oh."
222,"00:15:43,609","00:15:45,953",He called you to be here.
223,"00:15:47,530","00:15:50,249","As long as we're together,
that's all..."
224,"00:15:50,408","00:15:52,786","- Nothing else matters.
- Nothing else matters."
225,"00:16:01,878","00:16:05,257",I'm going with two years.
226,"00:16:05,423","00:16:07,926","What, too little?
10 years."
227,"00:16:08,092","00:16:10,686","10 years?
Are you kidding me?"
228,"00:16:10,845","00:16:13,724","No, they live
for about 45 days."
229,"00:16:13,890","00:16:17,315","The stronger ones can live
a little longer, like 60 days."
230,"00:16:17,477","00:16:20,105","10 years...
they'd have grey hair."
231,"00:16:21,481","00:16:24,405","Yeah, I guess 10 years is kind of
a long time for an ant to live, huh?"
232,"00:16:24,567","00:16:26,444",Yeah.
233,"00:16:26,611","00:16:30,036","Rebecca, do you think
I'll make friends here?"
234,"00:16:30,198","00:16:32,075",You kidding me?
235,"00:16:32,241","00:16:34,414",You? Mr. Personality?
236,"00:16:34,577","00:16:36,830","Of course you're gonna
make friends."
237,"00:16:36,996","00:16:39,277","Think about how much
a big city slicker kid like you knows"
238,"00:16:39,373","00:16:40,750",compared to these guys.
239,"00:16:40,917","00:16:43,420","Mary, honey."
240,"00:16:43,586","00:16:45,338","- Guys.
- What?"
241,"00:16:45,505","00:16:48,258","- Are they here?
- Mary, come here, please."
242,"00:16:48,424","00:16:50,768","- Put that away. Turn off the light.
- Hi. Here."
243,"00:16:50,927","00:16:53,771","It's our first night here and I just
wanted to say a little something."
244,"00:16:53,930","00:16:55,932",Come on.
245,"00:16:58,559","00:17:00,687","Hey.
A big change for us."
246,"00:17:00,853","00:17:02,776","And your mother and I
would like you to know"
247,"00:17:02,939","00:17:04,737","how much we appreciate
the love and support"
248,"00:17:04,899","00:17:08,870","that each one of you has given us
on our journey."
249,"00:17:09,028","00:17:11,122","I think we had a great life
in the city,"
250,"00:17:11,280","00:17:14,329","but I believe the Lord
has called us here."
251,"00:17:14,492","00:17:16,165",He didn't call me.
252,"00:17:16,327","00:17:18,295","Okay, all right, He called."
253,"00:17:18,454","00:17:20,798","Okay, put our hands together."
254,"00:17:20,957","00:17:23,710","Heavenly Father, thank You
for protecting us"
255,"00:17:23,876","00:17:25,253",on our long journey.
256,"00:17:25,419","00:17:27,672","Please, we ask You
to watch over us and guide us..."
257,"00:18:38,743","00:18:40,290",Wait up for us.
258,"00:18:42,496","00:18:44,498","Oh, good morning."
259,"00:18:48,044","00:18:49,387","Good morning.
Good morning."
260,"00:19:21,369","00:19:22,791","Good morning, friends."
261,"00:19:22,953","00:19:24,455",Good morning.
262,"00:19:24,622","00:19:27,421","Now before I get started,
I promised Mr. Roberts"
263,"00:19:27,583","00:19:30,507","that I would mention that we
still need a few volunteers"
264,"00:19:30,670","00:19:32,764","to help us set up
for tomorrow's summer festival,"
265,"00:19:32,922","00:19:35,141","so if you have
a little extra time"
266,"00:19:35,299","00:19:37,017","and want to lend
a helping hand,"
267,"00:19:37,176","00:19:39,474","please see Carl
after the service."
268,"00:19:39,637","00:19:41,355",Please be seated.
269,"00:19:47,853","00:19:50,606",I have spent a lot of years
270,"00:19:50,773","00:19:52,616",here with you
271,"00:19:52,775","00:19:56,655","and I would like to believe
that through all those years"
272,"00:19:56,821","00:19:59,995","we have built a community
of love and faith."
273,"00:20:02,368","00:20:04,245",I would also like to believe
274,"00:20:04,412","00:20:07,757","that we have learned
to trust each other."
275,"00:20:09,333","00:20:12,553","Now trust is
a very funny thing."
276,"00:20:12,712","00:20:16,967","It requires absolute belief
in one's soul, a complete faith."
277,"00:20:17,133","00:20:19,431",But it's different than faith.
278,"00:20:19,593","00:20:22,813","Trust also obligates
the person that is being trusted"
279,"00:20:22,972","00:20:25,145",to do the best he can.
280,"00:20:25,307","00:20:28,186","And so I am asking you
to trust me"
281,"00:20:28,352","00:20:30,446",one more time
282,"00:20:30,604","00:20:32,606",as I prepare to leave you.
283,"00:20:34,275","00:20:36,994",Today we welcome the Bramfords.
284,"00:20:37,153","00:20:39,030","Pastor Dan,"
285,"00:20:39,196","00:20:42,120","his lovely wife Wendy
and their three beautiful children"
286,"00:20:42,283","00:20:44,536",have all consented to join us.
287,"00:20:44,702","00:20:47,376","And I trust
that you will show them"
288,"00:20:47,538","00:20:49,415",the same love and compassion
289,"00:20:49,582","00:20:52,301","that you showed me
so many years ago."
290,"00:20:52,460","00:20:54,462",The Bramfords
291,"00:20:54,628","00:20:57,598","have made a great sacrifice
to be here with us."
292,"00:20:57,757","00:21:00,601","So let us welcome them
with open hearts"
293,"00:21:00,760","00:21:02,637",and open arms.
294,"00:21:02,803","00:21:06,023","Pastor Dan, your people."
295,"00:21:06,182","00:21:09,482","Thank you.
Thank you."
296,"00:21:13,606","00:21:16,200","Thank you, Pastor Kingsman."
297,"00:21:16,358","00:21:18,861","- And good morning, everyone.
- Good morning."
298,"00:21:19,028","00:21:21,247","First of all I would like
to thank you"
299,"00:21:21,405","00:21:25,035","for welcoming my family and I
into your lives."
300,"00:21:26,368","00:21:28,370",When I first received the offer
301,"00:21:28,537","00:21:30,915","to become your pastor
here in Stull,"
302,"00:21:31,081","00:21:33,379",my wife Wendy and I
303,"00:21:33,542","00:21:35,795",were unsure...
304,"00:21:35,961","00:21:38,430",unsure about moving a family
305,"00:21:38,589","00:21:40,512","halfway across the country,"
306,"00:21:40,674","00:21:42,802",unsure about leaving behind
307,"00:21:42,968","00:21:45,938","a life that we had come
to know and understand,"
308,"00:21:46,096","00:21:49,270",unsure about a new adventure.
309,"00:21:51,310","00:21:53,938","But in times of unsureness,"
310,"00:21:54,104","00:21:56,448","in times of great decision,"
311,"00:21:56,607","00:21:59,451","I put my faith in the Lord,"
312,"00:21:59,610","00:22:01,578","that He would provide for us,"
313,"00:22:01,737","00:22:04,206",that He had a plan for us.
314,"00:22:06,075","00:22:09,921",I think my faith
315,"00:22:10,079","00:22:12,958",was like a rock.
316,"00:22:13,123","00:22:16,627","I was reminded of
Matthew, chapter 7, verse 24,"
317,"00:22:16,794","00:22:19,388","which I would like to read to you
this morning."
318,"00:22:22,925","00:22:25,804","""Therefore whosoever heareth
these sayings of mine"
319,"00:22:25,970","00:22:28,473","and doeth them,"
320,"00:22:28,639","00:22:31,859","I will liken him
unto a wise man"
321,"00:22:32,017","00:22:34,941","which built his house
on a rock."
322,"00:22:35,104","00:22:37,402",And the rain descended
323,"00:22:37,565","00:22:39,442","and the floods came
and the winds blew"
324,"00:22:39,608","00:22:41,781",and beat upon that house.
325,"00:22:41,944","00:22:43,821","And it fell not,"
326,"00:22:43,988","00:22:47,288",for it was founded upon a rock.
327,"00:22:47,449","00:22:49,952","And everyone that heareth
these sayings of mine"
328,"00:22:50,119","00:22:53,248","and doeth them not
shall be likened to a foolish man"
329,"00:22:53,414","00:22:56,418","which built his house
upon the sand."""
330,"00:23:00,170","00:23:02,047",So nice to meet you.
331,"00:23:02,214","00:23:04,216",God bless. Thank you.
332,"00:23:07,761","00:23:10,139",Thank you.
333,"00:23:19,356","00:23:21,734","Not really your scene, huh?"
334,"00:23:23,193","00:23:24,570",What?
335,"00:23:24,737","00:23:26,410",This whole thing.
336,"00:23:26,572","00:23:28,199","I saw you inside.
You weren't singing."
337,"00:23:28,365","00:23:30,584","And then you left
during the sermon."
338,"00:23:30,743","00:23:32,791",I could say the same for you.
339,"00:23:32,953","00:23:35,547","Sounds like you were paying
more attention to what I was doing."
340,"00:23:35,706","00:23:37,583","Well, maybe,"
341,"00:23:37,750","00:23:39,752","but that's just 'cause you were
so obviously not into it."
342,"00:23:39,919","00:23:42,468","Yeah, you're right.
I'm not much into singing"
343,"00:23:42,630","00:23:44,758","and just not big
on the whole sermon thing."
344,"00:23:44,924","00:23:48,098","- No offense to your dad.
- None taken, trust me."
345,"00:23:48,260","00:23:51,104","I saw you and your family
when you got into town yesterday."
346,"00:23:51,263","00:23:53,140",I take it y'all met Mason.
347,"00:23:53,307","00:23:55,184","Oh, Mason?
He's the farm guy?"
348,"00:23:55,351","00:23:58,355","Yeah. Yeah, the farm guy."
349,"00:23:58,520","00:24:01,490","Okay, so then you were
the guy with the lambs and..."
350,"00:24:01,649","00:24:03,902",Technically they're sheep.
351,"00:24:04,068","00:24:07,914","Wow. Well,
you clean up well."
352,"00:24:12,534","00:24:15,083","Maybe I'll see you around
and show you the town."
353,"00:24:15,245","00:24:18,294","Yeah, cool.
Yeah, that'd be awesome."
354,"00:24:20,501","00:24:22,378","""You clean up well""?"
355,"00:24:22,544","00:24:25,047",Idiot.
356,"00:24:25,214","00:24:27,216",I have a hard time believing
357,"00:24:27,383","00:24:29,556","that your boxes are unpacked
and your room is clean."
358,"00:24:29,718","00:24:31,140",Huh?
359,"00:24:31,303","00:24:33,931","Mom, stop. I'm hungry.
Do we have any food in the house?"
360,"00:24:34,098","00:24:35,600","You're hungry?
Yeah, there's a little something."
361,"00:24:35,766","00:24:37,063",I'm sure you can make do.
362,"00:24:37,226","00:24:39,479","- And my boxes are unpacked.
- Uh-huh."
363,"00:24:39,645","00:24:42,398","- But define clean.
- Exactly what I thought."
364,"00:24:42,564","00:24:44,407","You know I hate
living in the mess, honey."
365,"00:24:44,566","00:24:47,410","Relax. It's only been a day.
They're just boxes."
366,"00:24:47,569","00:24:50,038","- Breathe.
- I'll breathe when you help me out."
367,"00:24:50,197","00:24:52,120","Oh, yeah."
368,"00:24:52,282","00:24:54,660","Okay, we are definitely
gonna need an escape plan."
369,"00:24:54,827","00:24:55,953",She's driving me nuts.
370,"00:24:56,120","00:24:58,122","I swear, if she brings up unpacking
one more time, I'm gonna kill her."
371,"00:24:58,288","00:25:01,132",I'm serious. We need a plan.
372,"00:25:01,291","00:25:03,168","Okay, like you mean the time
that we told Mom"
373,"00:25:03,335","00:25:05,335","we were going to Sonia Rosen's
house to sleep over,"
374,"00:25:05,421","00:25:06,923","so that we could see
the Stone Roses?"
375,"00:25:07,089","00:25:09,609","Yeah, we probably should have told
Sonia Martin about that plan."
376,"00:25:09,633","00:25:11,681","- Somehow I got blamed for that one.
- You did not."
377,"00:25:11,844","00:25:14,643","I got it way worse than you.
I was grounded for, like, two months."
378,"00:25:14,805","00:25:17,228","Remember? Because I should
have known better."
379,"00:25:17,391","00:25:20,065","Yeah, you should have known better."
380,"00:25:20,227","00:25:22,355","Hey, what are you eating?
I'm starving."
381,"00:25:22,521","00:25:24,740","Just peanut butter and jam
I found on the counter."
382,"00:25:24,898","00:25:27,276","Mm, sounds appetizing."
383,"00:25:29,570","00:25:31,993","Um, I would not do that
if I were you."
384,"00:25:32,156","00:25:34,196","Mom said we're saving that
for after dinner tonight."
385,"00:25:34,241","00:25:36,460","It's our first family dinner
in the new home,"
386,"00:25:36,618","00:25:38,120","blah, blah, blah."
387,"00:25:38,287","00:25:40,085","Oh, please."
388,"00:25:40,247","00:25:42,875","No, seriously, dude, you know
how Mom gets about that shit."
389,"00:25:44,043","00:25:46,137","None for me, thanks,
but when Mom kills you,"
390,"00:25:46,295","00:25:48,639","- I'll take your purple sweater.
- Fine."
391,"00:26:00,017","00:26:02,896","Mm, so good."
392,"00:26:10,778","00:26:13,076",Are you okay?
393,"00:26:14,073","00:26:16,701",Mary!
394,"00:26:16,867","00:26:19,290","Oh, shit."
395,"00:26:23,999","00:26:26,001","Oh, my God.
Jesus."
396,"00:26:26,168","00:26:28,466","- Are you okay?
- What was that?"
397,"00:26:28,629","00:26:30,631",I have no idea.
398,"00:26:32,424","00:26:34,097",Eww.
399,"00:26:35,677","00:26:37,350",Oh.
400,"00:26:39,681","00:26:42,025",I can't believe this came out.
401,"00:26:44,645","00:26:47,239","- I know.
- Holy shit."
402,"00:26:52,945","00:26:55,539",Fuck.
403,"00:27:00,619","00:27:02,917","Hi. What are you
doing here?"
404,"00:27:03,080","00:27:06,050","I told you I was gonna take you
around and show you some stuff."
405,"00:27:06,208","00:27:07,585","Oh, yeah."
406,"00:27:07,751","00:27:09,628","I just didn't know
you meant today."
407,"00:27:09,795","00:27:12,139",Is today bad?
408,"00:27:12,297","00:27:14,299",No. Come in.
409,"00:27:19,972","00:27:21,690",What happened?
410,"00:27:21,849","00:27:23,851",You have no idea.
411,"00:27:26,937","00:27:29,190","- Who puts a tooth in a cake?
- Tell me about it."
412,"00:27:29,356","00:27:31,199","It cut the crap
out of the roof of my mouth."
413,"00:27:33,110","00:27:35,033","This is one of
old Mrs. Gordon's cakes."
414,"00:27:35,195","00:27:38,199","A nice lady,
but she's almost 95."
415,"00:27:38,365","00:27:40,325","Let's just say you're lucky
this is all you found."
416,"00:27:40,409","00:27:42,411",Lucky?
417,"00:27:55,841","00:27:57,889",There. No more cake.
418,"00:27:58,051","00:27:59,928",So are you ready to go?
419,"00:28:00,095","00:28:01,597",Um...
420,"00:28:01,763","00:28:04,687","Just go, Becca.
I'm fine. Go. Escape."
421,"00:28:04,850","00:28:07,319","- Are you sure?
- Yeah. I'll be fine."
422,"00:28:07,477","00:28:10,321","A little weirded out,
but I'm fine."
423,"00:28:10,480","00:28:12,482",Okay
424,"00:28:14,359","00:28:16,361",Bye.
425,"00:29:26,056","00:29:28,104","So, not that this hasn't been great,"
426,"00:29:28,267","00:29:31,020","it has,"
427,"00:29:31,186","00:29:34,315","but is there anything
to actually do in town?"
428,"00:29:34,481","00:29:36,654","This isn't exactly
the big city."
429,"00:29:36,817","00:29:40,867","I know it's not the big city,
but there's gotta be something."
430,"00:29:41,029","00:29:43,157",There really isn't anything to do.
431,"00:29:44,866","00:29:47,244","Well, I mean,"
432,"00:29:47,411","00:29:50,255","could you give me a chance
to figure that out for myself maybe?"
433,"00:29:51,581","00:29:53,333",Please?
434,"00:29:53,500","00:29:55,252",Fine.
435,"00:30:43,383","00:30:45,977","So how long
have you lived here?"
436,"00:30:46,136","00:30:48,184","I don't know.
A long time."
437,"00:30:49,222","00:30:51,190","I guess
you're used to it then..."
438,"00:30:51,350","00:30:53,352",the whole country thing.
439,"00:30:54,811","00:30:56,813","No, you never really
get used to it."
440,"00:30:56,980","00:30:58,982",You just sort of adapt.
441,"00:31:02,110","00:31:05,159","I wasn't exactly thrilled
about moving here,"
442,"00:31:05,322","00:31:08,542",but it's kind of nice.
443,"00:31:10,077","00:31:12,455","- Afternoon.
- Hello."
444,"00:31:14,414","00:31:16,633",I should probably get you home.
445,"00:31:16,792","00:31:18,135",What?
446,"00:31:18,293","00:31:20,295",I thought we were having fun.
447,"00:31:20,462","00:31:22,464",It's not that.
448,"00:31:23,757","00:31:26,277","It's just it's getting late.
I don't want your parents worrying."
449,"00:31:26,301","00:31:27,723","Oh, please."
450,"00:31:27,886","00:31:30,309",Noah.
451,"00:31:30,472","00:31:33,191","Noah, Pastor Kingsman
is looking for you."
452,"00:31:33,350","00:31:34,897","Tell him I'll be there
in a few."
453,"00:31:35,060","00:31:36,858",He wants you now.
454,"00:31:38,397","00:31:40,274",I've got to go home.
455,"00:31:40,440","00:31:42,568","Home?
You live with Pastor Kingsman?"
456,"00:31:42,734","00:31:44,111",Noah.
457,"00:31:44,277","00:31:46,279",I'll explain later.
458,"00:31:48,156","00:31:50,375","Are you gonna be okay
getting home, young lady?"
459,"00:31:50,534","00:31:53,083","Yeah, sure."
460,"00:32:22,357","00:32:24,359",Noah.
461,"00:32:33,618","00:32:35,620",Noah.
462,"00:32:39,499","00:32:41,843",Has the choice been made?
463,"00:32:45,380","00:32:47,382",Noah.
464,"00:32:56,558","00:32:59,562","I know you're probably
scared right now."
465,"00:33:01,521","00:33:03,523",But you can do this.
466,"00:33:04,983","00:33:07,736","You're prepared for this.
You can do it, son."
467,"00:33:07,903","00:33:10,406",I'm not your son.
468,"00:33:11,823","00:33:14,417","And you have no idea
how I'm feeling right now."
469,"00:33:19,247","00:33:21,090",You're right.
470,"00:33:21,249","00:33:23,923","I wouldn't pretend to know
how you're feeling."
471,"00:33:26,630","00:33:28,883","But you knew
this day was coming."
472,"00:33:30,217","00:33:32,640","And there can be
no mistakes... none."
473,"00:33:37,140","00:33:41,111","Humble yourself
before the Lord, Noah."
474,"00:33:41,269","00:33:44,773","We are His servants.
We are here to do His will."
475,"00:33:44,940","00:33:48,114","We should not question
what is beyond our understanding."
476,"00:33:49,694","00:33:51,571","Put aside your weaknesses,"
477,"00:33:51,738","00:33:54,287",and He will give you strength.
478,"00:33:54,449","00:33:56,793",Do not get close to them...
479,"00:33:56,952","00:33:58,954","to any of them, to her."
480,"00:34:06,711","00:34:07,883",Here.
481,"00:34:11,716","00:34:13,718",Who is it?
482,"00:34:15,262","00:34:17,640",The younger sister... Mary.
483,"00:34:44,332","00:34:45,925","- Was it delicious?
- It was delicious."
484,"00:34:46,084","00:34:47,961","Yeah, it was delicious."
485,"00:34:48,128","00:34:50,005","Oh, hi, honey."
486,"00:34:50,171","00:34:52,299","Look, I left a plate for you
in the oven."
487,"00:34:52,465","00:34:54,342","How was your day?
Did you have fun?"
488,"00:34:54,509","00:34:57,262","Rebecca has a boyfriend.
Rebecca has a boyfriend."
489,"00:34:57,429","00:34:58,851",He's not my boyfriend.
490,"00:34:59,014","00:35:01,255","Well, I sure hope not.
You've only known him a few hours."
491,"00:35:01,349","00:35:03,022","- Where's Mary?
- She's upstairs."
492,"00:35:03,184","00:35:05,186","She hasn't been
feeling well all day."
493,"00:35:06,855","00:35:08,357","Oh, yeah, no problem.
Don't worry about it."
494,"00:35:08,523","00:35:11,402","You're welcome for that plate
I left for you in the oven."
495,"00:35:13,028","00:35:14,780","Oh, you think that's funny,
do you?"
496,"00:35:21,036","00:35:23,209","Ooh, wow, you look like shit."
497,"00:35:23,371","00:35:26,090",Thanks. I feel like shit.
498,"00:35:26,249","00:35:28,126",How's your mouth?
499,"00:35:28,293","00:35:30,045","Eh, it's okay."
500,"00:35:30,211","00:35:32,054",How was your date with Romeo?
501,"00:35:32,213","00:35:35,592","Fine, until that weird
Mason guy found us"
502,"00:35:35,759","00:35:37,477",and told him to go home.
503,"00:35:37,636","00:35:39,354",Guess where home is.
504,"00:35:39,512","00:35:41,230",He lives with Mason?
505,"00:35:41,389","00:35:42,891",Pastor Kingsman.
506,"00:35:43,058","00:35:44,560",What?
507,"00:35:44,726","00:35:47,229","Yeah, exactly.
It was weird."
508,"00:35:47,395","00:35:49,818",Nice but weird.
509,"00:35:49,981","00:35:53,110","Okay, why don't you start
with the nice?"
510,"00:35:53,276","00:35:56,496","I don't think I can stomach
the weird just yet."
511,"00:39:30,827","00:39:33,296","You do know we have
two separate rooms now, right?"
512,"00:39:33,454","00:39:36,003",Sorry. I was just so tired.
513,"00:39:36,165","00:39:37,587",I didn't feel like...
514,"00:39:37,750","00:39:39,798","Walking all the way
down the hall."
515,"00:39:39,961","00:39:41,463","Oh, you poor thing."
516,"00:39:41,629","00:39:44,007","All that flirting with that Noah guy
must have really taken a toll on you."
517,"00:39:44,173","00:39:46,722","Ha-ha.
You feeling better?"
518,"00:39:46,885","00:39:49,058","Eh, a little bit."
519,"00:39:49,220","00:39:51,518","But I've got to get out of this house.
So come on, get up."
520,"00:39:51,681","00:39:53,649","Let's go into town,
check out the boys."
521,"00:39:53,808","00:39:55,606",I need a little fun.
522,"00:39:59,606","00:40:01,726","- What are you doing?
- No, no, it's good."
523,"00:40:01,816","00:40:04,615","Oh, no, that doesn't look
very good at all, actually."
524,"00:40:04,777","00:40:07,030","- Easy now. Easy.
- What's with all the cookies?"
525,"00:40:07,196","00:40:08,823","Well, they are supposed to be
for the festival,"
526,"00:40:08,990","00:40:10,412","if your dad doesn't ruin
them all."
527,"00:40:10,575","00:40:12,043","Hey, easy.
I'm trying my best."
528,"00:40:12,201","00:40:14,454","Honey, yuck."
529,"00:40:14,621","00:40:17,795","Don't give him
all of your mistakes."
530,"00:40:17,957","00:40:20,335","- No, no, this is not a mistake.
- He is gonna get sick."
531,"00:40:20,501","00:40:21,941","So are you sure
you're gonna make it?"
532,"00:40:22,003","00:40:23,880","Yeah, I'm fine.
It just hurts to eat."
533,"00:40:24,047","00:40:26,391","- Okay, but I want to get out of here.
- I know."
534,"00:40:26,549","00:40:29,974","- A masterpiece.
- I'm watching you. That looks..."
535,"00:40:30,136","00:40:32,764","I'm gonna go to the park
with Pastor Kingsman."
536,"00:40:32,931","00:40:34,854","That sounds like
a really good idea, honey."
537,"00:40:35,016","00:40:37,360","Yeah, a pastor needs to be
with his people."
538,"00:40:37,518","00:40:39,361","Oh, can me and Mary
go to town too?"
539,"00:40:39,520","00:40:41,200","'Cause we want to walk around
a little bit."
540,"00:40:41,230","00:40:42,903","So nobody's gonna
help me out at all?"
541,"00:40:43,066","00:40:45,114","- No.
- No."
542,"00:40:45,276","00:40:46,653","Fine.
Take your brother."
543,"00:40:46,819","00:40:48,867","And get him something
other than a cookie to eat."
544,"00:40:49,030","00:40:51,579","All right, come on then.
Let's go."
545,"00:40:51,741","00:40:54,335","Hey, hey, hey, hey.
Hey, hey, hey, hey."
546,"00:40:54,494","00:40:57,213","- Come on, come on, come on.
- Out of here. Out of here."
547,"00:41:09,842","00:41:12,391","All right, you girls,
make yourself useful."
548,"00:41:12,553","00:41:14,772","- Help people out.
- Okay, Dad."
549,"00:41:14,931","00:41:16,808","- Hello.
- Hello."
550,"00:41:16,975","00:41:18,568","- Hello, Pastor.
- How are you?"
551,"00:41:18,726","00:41:20,728","- Nice to see you.
- Hello to you too."
552,"00:41:20,895","00:41:22,897","- Want to help her out?
- Hi."
553,"00:41:33,074","00:41:35,076",Hmm.
554,"00:41:36,744","00:41:39,998","Okay. Not bad.
He's kind of cute."
555,"00:41:40,164","00:41:42,337",10 seconds.
556,"00:41:42,500","00:41:44,753","It took you 10 seconds
to find your mark."
557,"00:41:44,919","00:41:46,637",It's a gift.
558,"00:41:56,097","00:41:57,974",Hi.
559,"00:41:58,141","00:42:00,940",What are you doing?
560,"00:42:01,102","00:42:03,696","Well, I'm Mary"
561,"00:42:03,855","00:42:06,483",and this is my sister Rebecca.
562,"00:42:08,359","00:42:10,111","- Smooth.
- Shut up."
563,"00:42:15,616","00:42:17,618",So have you lived here long?
564,"00:42:35,553","00:42:37,430","- Hi.
- Hey."
565,"00:42:37,597","00:42:39,474",Why are we hiding?
566,"00:42:39,640","00:42:41,984",We're not hiding.
567,"00:42:42,143","00:42:44,441","Well, maybe a little bit."
568,"00:42:44,604","00:42:46,732",You want to get out of here?
569,"00:42:46,898","00:42:49,321","Actually, there's something
I'd like to show you."
570,"00:42:50,693","00:42:53,242","- Right now?
- Yeah. Is that cool?"
571,"00:42:55,323","00:42:57,291","Yeah, sure.
Let me just go tell Mary."
572,"00:42:57,450","00:42:58,622",Okay
573,"00:43:02,830","00:43:04,673","What, is that
your kissing both?"
574,"00:43:04,832","00:43:06,926","- No.
- He's really cute."
575,"00:43:07,085","00:43:09,179","Um, I think
he just asked me out."
576,"00:43:09,337","00:43:10,429",Nice.
577,"00:43:10,588","00:43:12,465",Can you cover for me?
578,"00:43:12,632","00:43:15,181","Well, I can,
but it's gonna cost you."
579,"00:43:15,343","00:43:18,768","All right, fine. At least one
of us is doing all right."
580,"00:43:18,930","00:43:20,932","All right, thanks."
581,"00:43:24,102","00:43:26,355","- Hey.
- Hey."
582,"00:44:10,273","00:44:12,321",Is it weird?
583,"00:44:12,483","00:44:14,360",Ls what weird?
584,"00:44:14,527","00:44:16,404","Moving away from it all,"
585,"00:44:16,571","00:44:18,619",away from your home.
586,"00:44:18,781","00:44:21,034",My parents seem really happy.
587,"00:44:21,200","00:44:23,578","I think they were tired
of the city."
588,"00:44:25,246","00:44:27,419",What about you?
589,"00:44:27,582","00:44:30,005","Me? I'm fine, I guess."
590,"00:44:30,168","00:44:32,887","I mean, it's different,
but it's okay."
591,"00:44:33,045","00:44:35,468","Just okay, huh?"
592,"00:44:36,465","00:44:38,342",So where are we going?
593,"00:44:38,509","00:44:41,183","- You'll see.
- Okay."
594,"00:44:47,435","00:44:49,278","So you brought me
all the way out here"
595,"00:44:49,437","00:44:51,064",to show me an old rusty tower?
596,"00:44:51,230","00:44:54,951","This is so much more
than an old rusty tower."
597,"00:44:55,109","00:44:56,281",Really?
598,"00:44:57,862","00:45:00,240","Yeah, really."
599,"00:45:00,406","00:45:02,784","I want to show it to you,
but if you're scared..."
600,"00:45:02,950","00:45:05,169","Oh, you think that rickety old ladder
that climbs, what,"
601,"00:45:05,328","00:45:07,706","100 feet in the air
is too scary for me?"
602,"00:45:07,872","00:45:09,920",Please.
603,"00:45:14,045","00:45:15,922",Come on.
604,"00:45:16,088","00:45:18,090","What, are you chicken?"
605,"00:45:21,677","00:45:23,805",Come on.
606,"00:45:46,202","00:45:48,079","Oh, my God."
607,"00:45:48,246","00:45:50,248",This is beautiful.
608,"00:45:51,332","00:45:53,334",I told you.
609,"00:45:54,543","00:45:57,342","This is where I come when I want
to get away from everything."
610,"00:45:59,131","00:46:01,805",It's kind of special to me.
611,"00:46:01,968","00:46:04,016","Well, you weren't kidding."
612,"00:46:04,178","00:46:06,180",It's amazing.
613,"00:46:07,431","00:46:09,934","And you can see
everything from up here."
614,"00:46:11,352","00:46:13,775","Makes you feel like
there is a world beyond here."
615,"00:46:15,231","00:46:17,404",There is a world beyond here.
616,"00:46:17,566","00:46:19,739",You know what I mean.
617,"00:46:32,039","00:46:34,713","Thank you, Noah."
618,"00:46:34,875","00:46:36,752",For what?
619,"00:46:36,919","00:46:39,172",For taking me here.
620,"00:46:39,338","00:46:41,636","I can see
why it's so special to you."
621,"00:46:42,675","00:46:45,053",I'm just glad you like it.
622,"00:46:53,936","00:46:57,736","So are you gonna stay
here in town?"
623,"00:46:59,233","00:47:01,110","What do you mean?
I live here."
624,"00:47:01,277","00:47:04,656","No, I know you live here,
but I just thought"
625,"00:47:04,822","00:47:06,902","since your dad's retiring
and everything, maybe you..."
626,"00:47:06,907","00:47:08,375",My dad?
627,"00:47:08,534","00:47:10,411",Pastor Kingsman.
628,"00:47:10,578","00:47:12,922",Kingsman's not my dad.
629,"00:47:13,080","00:47:14,957",He's not your dad?
630,"00:47:15,124","00:47:18,173",But you live with him.
631,"00:47:18,336","00:47:20,213","Sorry.
It's none of my business."
632,"00:47:20,379","00:47:22,381","No, it's fine."
633,"00:47:25,885","00:47:27,933","When I lost my family,"
634,"00:47:28,095","00:47:30,723",Kingsman took me in.
635,"00:47:32,350","00:47:34,603","He's strict,
but he's a good guy."
636,"00:47:38,147","00:47:41,071","I get the feeling
he doesn't want us hanging out."
637,"00:47:42,651","00:47:44,528",Why would you say that?
638,"00:47:44,695","00:47:46,572","Well, that whole thing
with Mason"
639,"00:47:46,739","00:47:48,616",was a little weird yesterday.
640,"00:47:48,783","00:47:51,411",And us hiding from him today...
641,"00:47:51,577","00:47:53,454","I just... I feel like
he doesn't like me."
642,"00:47:53,621","00:47:55,840",It's not that.
643,"00:47:55,998","00:47:58,296",He's just being protective.
644,"00:47:58,459","00:48:01,679","He's not so keen
on the whole dating thing."
645,"00:48:01,837","00:48:03,714",Oh.
646,"00:48:03,881","00:48:05,883",So this is a date?
647,"00:48:07,259","00:48:08,636",I... I...
648,"00:48:08,803","00:48:10,805",I'm just kidding.
649,"00:48:30,741","00:48:32,618",Who is that?
650,"00:48:32,785","00:48:34,378",What?
651,"00:48:34,537","00:48:36,210","There's a guy down there
watching us."
652,"00:48:36,372","00:48:37,544",Where?
653,"00:48:41,710","00:48:43,178",We should go.
654,"00:48:43,337","00:48:44,805",Why? Who is it?
655,"00:48:44,964","00:48:48,218","I don't know. We should just go.
We shouldn't be up here."
656,"00:49:25,504","00:49:27,882","Did you think
I wouldn't find out?"
657,"00:49:28,048","00:49:31,348","You were gonna betray us... all of us.
I will not let that happen."
658,"00:49:31,510","00:49:33,071","So I just have to put up
with this shit?"
659,"00:49:33,179","00:49:35,539","My God, Noah, you've seen it.
You know what it's capable of."
660,"00:49:35,556","00:49:37,103",Why can't we stop it?
661,"00:49:37,266","00:49:39,189","It is God's will.
We are His servants."
662,"00:49:39,351","00:49:40,819",We must do everything we can...
663,"00:49:40,978","00:49:42,776",You're a fucking liar.
664,"00:49:42,938","00:49:45,032",Stop being such a child!
665,"00:49:46,609","00:49:49,453","Yes, we've been lied to.
Yes, we've been told stories..."
666,"00:49:49,612","00:49:52,035","stories of angels
that will come down from heaven"
667,"00:49:52,198","00:49:54,701","and slay the demons and send
them to hell and protect us all."
668,"00:49:54,867","00:49:57,666","There are no angels!
There is only us."
669,"00:49:59,622","00:50:02,796","You know what needs to be done.
And I need to know you'll do it."
670,"00:50:04,043","00:50:06,216",There is no other way.
671,"00:50:10,382","00:50:13,101","I just wish there was something
I could do to save them."
672,"00:50:13,260","00:50:15,262",Do your part.
673,"00:50:25,147","00:50:26,649","Oh, goodness. Hello."
674,"00:50:26,815","00:50:28,692","Mom, I'm gonna head off, okay?"
675,"00:50:28,859","00:50:30,827","Oh, you like that, don't you?"
676,"00:50:30,986","00:50:33,785","All right, well, you can go play
with the other kids."
677,"00:50:33,948","00:50:35,825","- Okay, Mom.
- Don't go too far."
678,"00:50:35,991","00:50:38,494",Check in with us.
679,"00:50:38,661","00:50:40,504",Mmmmm.
680,"00:50:40,663","00:50:42,711","I think we should do this
in the backyard."
681,"00:50:42,873","00:50:44,750",Hello. How are you?
682,"00:50:44,917","00:50:46,840","We're neighbors.
It's so nice to meet you."
683,"00:50:47,002","00:50:49,175","- Hello.
- Hi. Nice to see you."
684,"00:50:49,338","00:50:51,340","Well, aren't you handsome."
685,"00:50:51,507","00:50:54,226","- Hi.
- Hi there. Hi."
686,"00:50:55,928","00:50:58,681","Yeah, I got it. I got it."
687,"00:50:58,847","00:51:01,521",You did it. Awesome.
688,"00:51:02,768","00:51:04,361",Would you like some popcorn?
689,"00:51:17,074","00:51:19,202",Ooh!
690,"00:51:19,368","00:51:21,086",Was that you?
691,"00:51:21,245","00:51:23,373","Dad, you should try.
Come on."
692,"00:51:23,539","00:51:25,416",Let's get out of here.
693,"00:51:33,465","00:51:35,266","- Dad, please.
- You do it. Let him put you..."
694,"00:51:35,301","00:51:36,803","- In the tank?
- Come on, come on, come on."
695,"00:51:36,969","00:51:38,312","- Oh, really?
- Come on, come on."
696,"00:51:38,470","00:51:40,470","- So do you see him anywhere?
- Who?"
697,"00:51:40,556","00:51:42,684","Oh, don't even.
You know who. Noah."
698,"00:51:42,850","00:51:45,820","No, but he said he was coming,
so I'm not worried."
699,"00:51:54,820","00:51:56,493",So what do you guys think?
700,"00:51:56,655","00:51:58,828","Well, it's not totally lame."
701,"00:51:58,991","00:52:01,414",Yeah.
702,"00:52:01,577","00:52:05,172","Um, are there some cool games
or something?"
703,"00:52:05,331","00:52:07,925","Yes, sure. Come on."
704,"00:52:09,585","00:52:11,258","All right,
let's see what you got."
705,"00:52:11,420","00:52:13,500",Nice. That was not even close.
706,"00:52:13,547","00:52:15,595","All right, all right,
all right, all right."
707,"00:52:17,426","00:52:19,474",Nice.
708,"00:52:20,471","00:52:22,223","Oh, you guys
really suck at this."
709,"00:52:22,389","00:52:24,562","Shut up, Noah.
You're taking all the fun out of it."
710,"00:52:24,725","00:52:25,772",I'm just saying.
711,"00:52:25,934","00:52:27,936","And aren't you the one that's
supposed to be winning us a prize?"
712,"00:52:28,103","00:52:31,073","- Maybe he just can't throw a ball.
- Well, that's true."
713,"00:52:33,317","00:52:36,446","- Let me show you something.
- Oh, excuse me."
714,"00:52:38,113","00:52:39,786","- Oh.
- Holy shit."
715,"00:52:39,948","00:52:42,576","Maybe... maybe he can.
I don't know."
716,"00:52:42,743","00:52:44,290",Let's just take a seat.
717,"00:52:44,453","00:52:46,205","- I'm good. Thank you though.
- No? No?"
718,"00:52:46,372","00:52:48,545","- I'm also good.
- Thanks."
719,"00:52:48,707","00:52:51,051",Cute.
720,"00:53:04,264","00:53:05,811","Let's see what you got, Mary."
721,"00:53:05,974","00:53:07,351","Oh, I'm not...
I can't follow that."
722,"00:53:07,518","00:53:09,646","I'm kind of thirsty. You guys want
to grab something to drink?"
723,"00:53:09,812","00:53:12,190","Oh, that sounds good. I want one
of those pies I keep seeing around."
724,"00:53:12,356","00:53:14,450","- Of course you do.
- Shut up."
725,"00:53:20,989","00:53:23,242","Do you see them?
They look so happy."
726,"00:53:23,409","00:53:26,208","- They just fit right in here.
- I know. It's kind of perfect."
727,"00:53:30,040","00:53:31,417",Thank you.
728,"00:53:31,583","00:53:34,132","- So what can I get for you kids?
- Do you have pie here?"
729,"00:53:34,294","00:53:35,494","- We sure do.
- Can I have one?"
730,"00:53:35,587","00:53:37,089","What about you?
What would you like?"
731,"00:53:37,256","00:53:38,883",You? Anything to drink?
732,"00:53:42,594","00:53:44,596","We'll have three
lemonades, please."
733,"00:53:46,390","00:53:48,267","All right, well,
I guess I'm having lemonade."
734,"00:53:50,686","00:53:52,563","Hey, are you okay?"
735,"00:53:52,730","00:53:54,448",What? Yeah.
736,"00:54:08,328","00:54:09,420",Here you go.
737,"00:54:09,580","00:54:11,582",Thank you.
738,"00:54:13,333","00:54:15,381","- You guys want to go?
- Yeah."
739,"00:54:29,892","00:54:32,395",Whoa. Whoa. Whoa.
740,"00:54:32,561","00:54:34,939","Are you okay?
What happened?"
741,"00:54:35,105","00:54:36,357","No, I'm fine."
742,"00:54:36,523","00:54:38,571","I'm good. I thought I was feeling
better, but I guess I'm not."

- What?"
813,"01:02:07,515","01:02:10,689","I think Mary's sick.
Mom wants you."
814,"01:02:10,852","01:02:12,695",What happened?
815,"01:02:12,854","01:02:15,027","I don't know.
She doesn't look good though."

822,"01:02:29,204","01:02:31,377","She'll be all right.
She's just not feeling very well."
823,"01:02:33,541","01:02:36,135","All right, sweetie.
Let's just get her upstairs."
824,"01:02:36,294","01:02:38,342",Watch your brother.
825,"01:02:38,505","01:02:40,849","Hey, let's watch TV."

831,"01:03:21,006","01:03:23,805","Is there any way
we could do it tomorrow?"

835,"01:03:33,393","01:03:35,646",I have to go to the church.
836,"01:03:35,812","01:03:38,031","What, now? What for?"
837,"01:03:38,189","01:03:40,362",I don't know.
838,"01:03:40,525","01:03:42,903","Kingsman said
that he needed me."
839,"01:03:44,029","01:03:45,906","At this hour?
You can't go now."
840,"01:03:46,072","01:03:47,949",He knows your daughter's sick.
841,"01:03:48,116","01:03:49,959","Yeah, he said
that it was important."
842,"01:03:50,118","01:03:51,961","- Honey, I don't...
- How is she?"
843,"01:03:52,120","01:03:53,622","She's not well.
She's sweating a lot."
844,"01:03:53,788","01:03:55,748","She doesn't have a fever.
I don't know what it is."
845,"01:03:55,832","01:03:58,130","Okay.
It shouldn't be long, all right?"
846,"01:04:38,166","01:04:40,168",Hello?
847,"01:04:41,336","01:04:43,213",Hello?

852,"01:05:15,370","01:05:17,793","I had to get you away
from there."
853,"01:05:17,956","01:05:21,051",It needs time.
854,"01:05:21,209","01:05:23,337","Not much, but it needs time."
855,"01:05:26,297","01:05:28,891","I'm afraid
that I'm not following."
856,"01:05:29,050","01:05:30,768",I don't know what needs time
857,"01:05:30,927","01:05:32,554","and what I'm supposed
to get away from."
858,"01:05:32,720","01:05:35,018","Yes, Dan, you are.
You are following."
859,"01:05:35,181","01:05:39,357",You are following His will.
860,"01:05:43,815","01:05:46,659","You are a good man, Dan.
You are such a good man."
861,"01:05:46,818","01:05:48,695",And I am so sorry.
862,"01:05:48,862","01:05:52,116","I'm so sorry

She is so young."
865,"01:05:58,913","01:06:01,041","What... what are you
talking about?"
866,"01:06:01,207","01:06:04,507","God give us strength
to do what must be done."

1020,"01:19:37,731","01:19:39,074",We aren't meant to.
1021,"01:19:39,233","01:19:41,656","My whole family was brought here
just like yours."

it's fucking perfect,"
1023,"01:19:44,613","01:19:46,493","and then you're fucked...
you, your whole family."
1024,"01:19:46,532","01:19:47,533",That's just what happens.
1025,"01:19:47,700","01:19:49,293","If they even knew I was
telling you any of this..."

Pastor Kingsman?"
1027,"01:19:51,495","01:19:52,621",Kingsman is just the keeper.
1028,"01:19:52,788","01:19:54,389","He is just doing
what he was asked to do."
1029,"01:19:54,498","01:19:58,378","This place is a doorway,
and on the other side is evil."
1030,"01:19:58,544","01:20:00,262","We were picked to be a part
of this great, big plan"
1031,"01:20:00,421","01:20:01,581",that we have no control over.
1032,"01:20:01,672","01:20:03,392","All I know is that once
the doorway is open,"
1033,"01:20:03,507","01:20:06,010","we have one job,
and one job only... to shut it."
1034,"01:20:07,803","01:20:09,851","I'm sorry.
I'm trying to save you."
1035,"01:20:10,014","01:20:12,062","Please trust me.
You have to get back in the car"

1054,"01:22:30,237","01:22:31,830","Oh, God."
1055,"01:22:33,615","01:22:35,617",There she... there she is!
1056,"01:22:39,746","01:22:41,248",Christopher is inside.

1058,"01:22:43,625","01:22:46,299",Is he gonna be safe in there?
1059,"01:22:46,462","01:22:49,762","I'm sorry,
but you can't stay here."
1060,"01:22:49,923","01:22:51,925",Please.
1061,"01:22:55,262","01:22:57,139",Why?

1063,"01:23:05,856","01:23:07,699",Why won't you help me?
1064,"01:23:10,569","01:23:12,788","I'm sorry,
but you have to leave."
1065,"01:23:12,946","01:23:15,415","- Please. No. No!
- I'm sorry, but you have to leave."
1066,"01:23:15,574","01:23:18,999","- I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

has asked us to do."
1118,"01:29:34,411","01:29:37,210","We must close the gate
and end this,"
1119,"01:29:37,372","01:29:40,501","or else darkness
will subdue the light"
1120,"01:29:40,667","01:29:43,090",and the world will become his.
