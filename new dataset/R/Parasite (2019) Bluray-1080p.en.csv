1,"00:01:28,853","00:01:30,594",We're screwed.
2,"00:01:30,730","00:01:32,767",No more free wi-fi.
3,"00:01:33,900","00:01:35,436","- Hey, Ki-jung!
- Yeah?"
4,"00:01:36,110","00:01:39,729","The lady upstairs put
a password on 'iptime'."
5,"00:01:40,740","00:01:41,901",A password?
6,"00:01:42,033","00:01:43,695",Did you try 123456789?
7,"00:01:43,785","00:01:44,901",No luck.
8,"00:01:44,994","00:01:46,405",Do it the other way.
9,"00:01:46,496","00:01:48,078",I tried that too!
10,"00:01:48,373","00:01:52,162","Fuck, then we can't get WhatsApp?"
11,"00:01:52,252","00:01:53,618",Nothing.
12,"00:01:54,003","00:01:55,790","Hey, Kim Ki-taek."
13,"00:01:56,714","00:02:00,048","Don't fucking pretend to sleep.
What do you think?"
14,"00:02:00,718","00:02:06,385","Our phones are shut off.
Now our wifi is shut off."
15,"00:02:07,225","00:02:09,012",What's your plan?
16,"00:02:12,730","00:02:14,062","- Ki-woo.
- Yes, Dad?"
17,"00:02:14,148","00:02:17,687","For wifi, hold it high."
18,"00:02:19,112","00:02:22,856",Stick it in every corner and so on.
19,"00:02:26,661","00:02:30,450",Damn stink bugs.
20,"00:02:31,374","00:02:33,536",Over here! I got it!
21,"00:02:33,626","00:02:34,958",Really? You got a signal?
22,"00:02:35,044","00:02:36,785","Yeah, see?"
23,"00:02:36,963","00:02:39,501","This one, 'coffeeland 2G'."
24,"00:02:39,716","00:02:41,628",Did a new cafe open?
25,"00:02:41,843","00:02:43,425",Why can't I get it?
26,"00:02:43,511","00:02:45,093",Climb up here.
27,"00:02:45,179","00:02:46,465",Hey kids.
28,"00:02:47,307","00:02:48,923","- Does it work?
- Yeah."
29,"00:02:49,017","00:02:51,350",Then check WhatsApp.
30,"00:02:51,853","00:02:54,345",Pizza Generation said they'd contact me.
31,"00:02:54,814","00:02:56,100",Hold on.
32,"00:02:56,691","00:02:58,899",Here it is. Pizza Generation.
33,"00:03:02,238","00:03:05,231","Wow! Check this out, guys."
34,"00:03:06,034","00:03:09,243","If we go as fast as her,
we can finish today."
35,"00:03:09,329","00:03:10,615",Then we can get paid.
36,"00:03:10,705","00:03:13,823","- Should we stand up too?
- She's a pro."
37,"00:03:14,250","00:03:17,038",What? Fumigation?
38,"00:03:19,005","00:03:20,496",They still do that kind of thing?
39,"00:03:20,590","00:03:21,590",Guess so.
40,"00:03:21,633","00:03:22,466",Shut the window.
41,"00:03:22,467","00:03:24,959","Leave it open.
We'll get free extermination."
42,"00:03:25,178","00:03:26,635",Kill the stink bugs.
43,"00:03:26,846","00:03:29,384","Right, too many stink bugs
these days..."
44,"00:03:31,768","00:03:33,805","God, that smells!"
45,"00:03:36,564","00:03:38,271",I told you to shut it!
46,"00:03:38,524","00:03:40,311","Should I shut it, Dad?"
47,"00:03:51,162","00:03:53,245",What exactly is the problem?
48,"00:03:54,123","00:03:56,866",Take this one as an example.
49,"00:03:57,168","00:03:59,376",You call this a straight line?
50,"00:03:59,754","00:04:01,586",And why's it folded here?
51,"00:04:01,923","00:04:03,539",Why is this sticking up?
52,"00:04:03,716","00:04:06,049",You didn't even fold it.
53,"00:04:07,261","00:04:11,221",A quarter of them look like this.
54,"00:04:11,307","00:04:13,799",So 1 out of 4 are rejects.
55,"00:04:16,979","00:04:20,723","So you're really docking
10% off our pay?"
56,"00:04:21,150","00:04:24,643","Considering the rejects,
that's a low penalty, isn't it?"
57,"00:04:25,697","00:04:29,281","Our pay is so low already!
How can you do this?"
58,"00:04:30,868","00:04:32,109",Look here.
59,"00:04:32,328","00:04:34,786",This is not some minor issue.
60,"00:04:34,956","00:04:40,122","You know what one shitty box
can do to our brand image?"
61,"00:04:40,420","00:04:43,663","Brand? You can't even afford
a box folder!"
62,"00:04:43,756","00:04:45,167",What did you say?
63,"00:04:46,134","00:04:47,375",Boss.
64,"00:04:48,136","00:04:49,530","This is all because
of that guy, right?"
65,"00:04:49,554","00:04:50,554",What guy?
66,"00:04:50,638","00:04:54,302","Your part-time worker.
He's gone AWOL, right?"
67,"00:04:54,517","00:04:58,511","Just when the Love of God Church
made a huge group order?"
68,"00:04:58,771","00:05:00,854",How do you know all that?
69,"00:05:01,065","00:05:02,556",Who told you?
70,"00:05:02,900","00:05:04,641",My sister knows the guy.
71,"00:05:04,861","00:05:09,105","He's always been a bit strange.
Got a bad reputation."
72,"00:05:09,449","00:05:11,236","Speaking of which, Boss."
73,"00:05:11,951","00:05:14,034",We'll accept a 10% penalty.
74,"00:05:14,120","00:05:15,156",In return...
75,"00:05:15,246","00:05:16,327",In return?
76,"00:05:16,706","00:05:19,198","Any thought of hiring
a new part-time worker?"
77,"00:05:19,333","00:05:22,747","Sis, we need someone!"
78,"00:05:23,171","00:05:26,289","Ditch the guy you've got now.
Just fire him."
79,"00:05:27,008","00:05:30,297","Tomorrow I'll come for
a formal interview. What time?"
80,"00:05:30,386","00:05:31,877","Wait, hold on a sec."
81,"00:05:32,805","00:05:35,013",Let me think about it.
82,"00:05:35,349","00:05:38,433","Then for now,
just pay for the boxes."
83,"00:05:45,193","00:05:48,561","So we're all gathered here today,"
84,"00:05:49,113","00:05:52,652","to celebrate the reconnection
of our phones,"
85,"00:05:52,742","00:05:56,406",and this bounteous wi-fi!
86,"00:05:56,496","00:05:59,739","Look at that bastard.
It's not even dark yet."
87,"00:06:01,876","00:06:04,289","Why didn't you put up
a 'No Urinating' sign?"
88,"00:06:04,378","00:06:05,337",I told you!
89,"00:06:05,338","00:06:09,708","No, signs like that
just make them piss even more."
90,"00:06:10,051","00:06:11,883",At least shout at him!
91,"00:06:11,969","00:06:13,460",Don't shout.
92,"00:06:13,679","00:06:15,511","""Please don't piss!"""
93,"00:06:17,308","00:06:20,301","Hey, is that Min?"
94,"00:06:20,937","00:06:23,099","Hey mister, that's not a toilet."
95,"00:06:23,189","00:06:24,555","Way to go, Min."
96,"00:06:24,649","00:06:26,686","Hey, punk!"
97,"00:06:26,776","00:06:29,940","Who are you staring at, asshole?"
98,"00:06:30,196","00:06:33,360",Come here! You little shit.
99,"00:06:35,201","00:06:37,318",Get a fucking grip!
100,"00:06:38,538","00:06:40,825",That's an impressive friend.
101,"00:06:40,915","00:06:43,783","College students have
a real vigor to them."
102,"00:06:44,043","00:06:45,043",Not like my brother.
103,"00:06:45,127","00:06:48,461","But is he coming here?
Did you invite him?"
104,"00:06:48,548","00:06:49,629",No.
105,"00:06:49,757","00:06:50,838",Hello!
106,"00:06:50,925","00:06:52,461","Oh hi, Min!"
107,"00:06:52,802","00:06:53,802",Min!
108,"00:06:53,845","00:06:54,678","Are you well, sir?"
109,"00:06:54,679","00:06:57,217","- Sure.
- What are you doing here?"
110,"00:06:57,306","00:06:59,172",I texted you. Didn't you see it?
111,"00:06:59,517","00:07:00,678","Sorry, were you eating?"
112,"00:07:00,768","00:07:02,054","No, we weren't eating."
113,"00:07:02,144","00:07:04,431","- How are you, Ki-jung?
- Fine, you too?"
114,"00:07:04,522","00:07:07,230","We could've met outside,
why come here?"
115,"00:07:07,316","00:07:08,191",Because of this.
116,"00:07:08,192","00:07:10,980","It's for you,
but it's so heavy."
117,"00:07:11,112","00:07:13,445",Really? Put it down here.
118,"00:07:15,408","00:07:16,990","Wow, what is that?"
119,"00:07:17,076","00:07:18,692","When I said I was meeting Ki-woo,"
120,"00:07:18,786","00:07:22,245","my grandfather insisted
I bring this to you."
121,"00:07:26,210","00:07:28,543",Is this a landscape type?
122,"00:07:29,797","00:07:31,709","Or you can see it
as an abstract type."
123,"00:07:31,799","00:07:33,461","Wow, you know these!"
124,"00:07:33,551","00:07:37,545","My grandpa has collected scholar's rocks
since his cadet days."
125,"00:07:37,722","00:07:41,215","Now the annex, the study,
every room in the house"
126,"00:07:41,309","00:07:43,266",is filled with these things.
127,"00:07:43,561","00:07:47,350","But this stone here is said
to bring material wealth to families..."
128,"00:07:47,440","00:07:48,681",Min!
129,"00:07:48,941","00:07:51,809",This is so metaphorical.
130,"00:07:52,111","00:07:55,320","For sure.
It's a very opportune gift."
131,"00:07:55,406","00:07:56,281",Of course.
132,"00:07:56,282","00:08:00,276","Please relay our deepest
thanks to your grandpa."
133,"00:08:00,536","00:08:02,323",Food would be better.
134,"00:08:12,340","00:08:15,504","What was that called?
A landscape stone?"
135,"00:08:15,635","00:08:17,046",You collect those rocks too?
136,"00:08:17,136","00:08:21,881","Hey, thanks to that rock
I saw your parents, they look healthy."
137,"00:08:24,018","00:08:26,977","They're plenty healthy,
just out of work."
138,"00:08:29,440","00:08:31,682","Is Ki-jung taking lessons
these days?"
139,"00:08:32,902","00:08:35,690",She can't afford lessons.
140,"00:08:44,580","00:08:46,037","Cute, huh?"
141,"00:08:46,916","00:08:49,374",She's the one you're tutoring?
142,"00:08:49,502","00:08:51,619","Park Da-hye.
High school sophomore."
143,"00:08:52,046","00:08:55,210","You take over
as her English tutor."
144,"00:08:55,716","00:08:56,797",What do you mean?
145,"00:08:56,884","00:08:59,001","Tutor a rich kid.
It pays well."
146,"00:09:00,137","00:09:01,469",She's a nice girl.
147,"00:09:01,555","00:09:04,514","Look after her while
I'm studying abroad."
148,"00:09:05,351","00:09:08,685",What about your university friends?
149,"00:09:08,896","00:09:12,139",Why ask a loser like me?
150,"00:09:12,692","00:09:14,183",Why do you think?
151,"00:09:14,819","00:09:16,981",Just the thought makes me sick.
152,"00:09:17,154","00:09:21,319","Those disgusting frat boys
slavering over Da-hye?"
153,"00:09:21,409","00:09:23,150",It's revolting.
154,"00:09:29,166","00:09:30,327",You like her?
155,"00:09:35,423","00:09:37,540","Hey, I'm serious."
156,"00:09:38,801","00:09:42,886","When she enters university,
I'll officially ask her out."
157,"00:09:43,431","00:09:45,388","So you take care of
her until then."
158,"00:09:45,474","00:09:49,138","If it's you,
I can leave in peace."
159,"00:09:50,980","00:09:53,723","Thanks for your trust,"
160,"00:09:54,150","00:09:57,393","but do I have to pretend to be
a college student?"
161,"00:09:59,363","00:10:02,151","Ki-woo, think about it."
162,"00:10:02,867","00:10:06,326","For years including
your military service,"
163,"00:10:06,495","00:10:08,578","you took the university entrance
exam 4 times."
164,"00:10:08,873","00:10:11,832","Grammar, vocabulary,
composition, conversation..."
165,"00:10:12,418","00:10:14,034","When it comes to English,"
166,"00:10:14,128","00:10:18,589","you can teach 10 times better than
those drunken college pricks."
167,"00:10:19,884","00:10:22,342","- I guess so.
- Sure!"
168,"00:10:22,720","00:10:26,339","But will they hire me?
I'm not a college student."
169,"00:10:26,599","00:10:28,056",Just fake it.
170,"00:10:28,142","00:10:31,852","Don't worry, you'll have
my recommendation, plus..."
171,"00:10:32,938","00:10:35,351",How should I describe the mother...?
172,"00:10:37,943","00:10:39,354",She's a bit simple.
173,"00:10:39,528","00:10:40,689",Young and simple.
174,"00:10:40,780","00:10:41,987",Simple?
175,"00:10:42,364","00:10:43,821",What do you mean?
176,"00:10:43,949","00:10:47,863","Anyway, it's all good.
I had fun there."
177,"00:10:48,579","00:10:49,786",So you agree?
178,"00:10:49,872","00:10:51,329",I guess so.
179,"00:10:52,625","00:10:56,369","Hey, you said
your sister is artistic?"
180,"00:10:56,587","00:10:58,328",Good at Photoshop?
181,"00:11:00,966","00:11:05,051","God, with skills like this,
why can't you get into art school?"
182,"00:11:05,137","00:11:06,469",Shut up.
183,"00:11:08,933","00:11:11,175","Hey, no smoking in here."
184,"00:11:11,268","00:11:12,634","Yeah, yeah. Gimme that."
185,"00:11:12,728","00:11:13,844",Yeah.
186,"00:11:18,317","00:11:20,855",Now the cherry on top...
187,"00:11:22,404","00:11:26,899","Wow, does Oxford have
a major in document forgery?"
188,"00:11:27,201","00:11:30,444",Ki-jung would be top of her class.
189,"00:11:30,621","00:11:33,159","She's amazing, huh?"
190,"00:11:33,374","00:11:38,790","Our boy's going for a job interview.
Wish him luck."
191,"00:11:39,338","00:11:40,579",Son.
192,"00:11:41,507","00:11:44,250",I'm proud of you.
193,"00:11:44,593","00:11:45,709",Dad.
194,"00:11:46,595","00:11:49,588","I don't think of this
as forgery or crime."
195,"00:11:49,974","00:11:51,931","I'll go to this university
next year."
196,"00:11:52,017","00:11:55,385",So you've got a plan!
197,"00:11:55,729","00:11:59,268","I just printed out the document
a bit early."
198,"00:12:34,935","00:12:36,301",Who is it?
199,"00:12:36,562","00:12:38,554",Madame? Good afternoon.
200,"00:12:38,689","00:12:40,476",I'm here on Min's recommendation...
201,"00:12:40,566","00:12:42,307","Oh right, come in."
202,"00:12:43,611","00:12:44,977",Thank you.
203,"00:13:16,477","00:13:17,809",Hello!
204,"00:13:18,729","00:13:20,061","Hello, Madame."
205,"00:13:20,231","00:13:23,724","I just work here.
Come this way."
206,"00:13:24,151","00:13:25,767",The yard is so nice.
207,"00:13:25,861","00:13:27,523",The inside's nice too.
208,"00:13:27,863","00:13:31,231","You know the architect Namgoong?
He's famous."
209,"00:13:31,408","00:13:33,946",He used to live in this house.
210,"00:13:36,121","00:13:38,363",He designed it himself.
211,"00:13:41,210","00:13:46,330","As you can see,
now it's a playpen."
212,"00:13:46,674","00:13:48,040",This way.
213,"00:13:50,177","00:13:52,669","Sit yourself down here.
I'll bring the madame."
214,"00:13:52,763","00:13:53,970",Yes.
215,"00:14:06,110","00:14:07,271",Madame.
216,"00:14:08,362","00:14:09,478",Madame?
217,"00:14:12,199","00:14:13,315",Madame?
218,"00:14:15,327","00:14:16,568",Madame?
219,"00:14:20,207","00:14:22,415","He's here.
The tutoring candidate."
220,"00:14:26,130","00:14:28,372",I don't care about documents.
221,"00:14:28,924","00:14:31,337","Min recommended you, after all."
222,"00:14:32,219","00:14:38,090","As you know, Min is such
a brilliant human being."
223,"00:14:38,851","00:14:41,013","Da-hye and I were quite happy
with him."
224,"00:14:41,186","00:14:44,395","Regardless of her grades.
Know what I mean?"
225,"00:14:44,523","00:14:45,684",Yes.
226,"00:14:45,983","00:14:47,895",He was marvelous.
227,"00:14:47,985","00:14:54,983","So to be honest, we wanted to stick
with him through high school."
228,"00:14:55,743","00:14:58,611","But all of a sudden
he's going abroad."
229,"00:15:01,165","00:15:06,456","Anyway, excuse me,
but if I can speak directly,"
230,"00:15:06,712","00:15:11,548","if you're not up
to Min's level, then,"
231,"00:15:11,633","00:15:14,091","I'm not sure
what the point is."
232,"00:15:15,846","00:15:19,635","So anyway,
what I want to say is,"
233,"00:15:19,975","00:15:25,266","for your first lesson today,
do you mind if I sit in?"
234,"00:15:25,689","00:15:29,308","I want to see it full time,
how you run your lesson."
235,"00:15:31,487","00:15:33,524",Is it okay with you?
236,"00:16:01,892","00:16:03,929",You sure about #24?
237,"00:16:11,485","00:16:16,150","Da-hye, you solved those later problems
then went back to #24."
238,"00:16:16,448","00:16:17,814",Right?
239,"00:16:19,451","00:16:20,692",Yes.
240,"00:16:28,669","00:16:33,380","If that were the first question
on a real exam, you'd be screwed."
241,"00:16:34,550","00:16:37,714","Look at this.
Your pulse is racing."
242,"00:16:40,681","00:16:43,845",The heart doesn't lie.
243,"00:16:45,018","00:16:48,352","An exam is like slashing through
a jungle."
244,"00:16:48,522","00:16:51,014","Lose that momentum
and you're finished."
245,"00:16:51,442","00:16:53,775","The answer to #24?
I don't care."
246,"00:16:53,986","00:16:59,072","Slashing through the exam,
dominating it!"
247,"00:16:59,783","00:17:01,365",That's all I care about.
248,"00:17:02,619","00:17:06,033",What you need is vigor.
249,"00:17:07,541","00:17:08,748",Vigor.
250,"00:17:10,002","00:17:11,368",Understand?
251,"00:17:22,347","00:17:25,215","So I'll pay you
this time each month."
252,"00:17:25,309","00:17:28,598","3 classes a week,
2 hours each, okay?"
253,"00:17:29,313","00:17:30,429","As for the fee,"
254,"00:17:30,522","00:17:34,391","I was going to pay Min's rate,
then I added a bit for inflation."
255,"00:17:34,485","00:17:35,771",Thank you.
256,"00:17:36,987","00:17:39,320",How about a proper introduction?
257,"00:17:39,531","00:17:42,444","Da-hye's tutor,
we'll call him Kevin."
258,"00:17:42,993","00:17:44,655",Mr. Kevin!
259,"00:17:45,078","00:17:48,321","If you feel like snacking
during your lesson, just call me."
260,"00:17:48,790","00:17:50,827","If you need anything, ask her."
261,"00:17:50,918","00:17:53,456",She knows this house better than I...
262,"00:17:53,587","00:17:56,705","Da-song, stop it!"
263,"00:17:57,299","00:17:58,881","I'm sorry, did he startle you?"
264,"00:17:58,967","00:18:01,459",How cute. His name's Da-song?
265,"00:18:01,553","00:18:03,294","Yes, our youngest."
266,"00:18:03,514","00:18:05,096","Da-song, come say hi!"
267,"00:18:05,182","00:18:06,718",This is Mr. Kevin!
268,"00:18:08,977","00:18:13,597","This is an Indian arrow.
I ordered it from the U.S."
269,"00:18:13,690","00:18:16,433","From last year he's been
an Indian fanatic."
270,"00:18:18,445","00:18:19,856",Indians?
271,"00:18:20,614","00:18:23,277",He's got a fanboy personality?
272,"00:18:23,450","00:18:27,114","Well, he's eccentric
and easily distracted,"
273,"00:18:27,204","00:18:29,491",he can barely sit still!
274,"00:18:29,957","00:18:32,119","So last year I enrolled him
in Cub Scouts,"
275,"00:18:32,209","00:18:35,202","hoping he'd learn moderation
and focus."
276,"00:18:35,295","00:18:36,706",But look.
277,"00:18:37,506","00:18:39,042",He's even worse.
278,"00:18:41,593","00:18:46,463","His scout leader is an Indian fanatic,
maybe that's why."
279,"00:18:48,308","00:18:51,392","The American Indian is
the very spirit of the Cub Scouts."
280,"00:18:51,478","00:18:52,514",It's a good thing.
281,"00:18:52,604","00:18:55,563","Were you a Cub Scout, Kevin?"
282,"00:18:55,732","00:18:58,725","Sure, I'm a Scout by nature."
283,"00:18:59,027","00:19:03,112","Da-song is an artist by nature.
Look at this painting."
284,"00:19:03,991","00:19:06,950","It's so metaphorical.
It's really strong."
285,"00:19:07,286","00:19:08,743","Strong, right?"
286,"00:19:09,037","00:19:10,949",You've got an eye for this.
287,"00:19:12,457","00:19:14,039","It's a chimpanzee, right?"
288,"00:19:14,126","00:19:15,583",A self-portrait.
289,"00:19:18,797","00:19:20,208",Sure enough!
290,"00:19:21,425","00:19:24,793","The perspective of
a young artist eludes understanding."
291,"00:19:24,970","00:19:27,257","Or perhaps it's Da-song's
expressive genius..."
292,"00:19:27,639","00:19:32,725","Anyway, we've been through
so many art teachers."
293,"00:19:33,061","00:19:35,269",None of them lasts even a month.
294,"00:19:36,898","00:19:39,857","And Da-song is just so hard
to control."
295,"00:19:42,529","00:19:44,862","- Just a moment, Madame.
- Yes?"
296,"00:19:45,282","00:19:48,491",Someone just came to mind.
297,"00:19:49,161","00:19:50,743",What was her name?
298,"00:19:51,204","00:19:53,742","Jessica! Right, Jessica..."
299,"00:19:54,082","00:19:58,167","She was in the same art school
as my cousin."
300,"00:19:58,462","00:20:00,829",What was her Korean name?
301,"00:20:01,214","00:20:06,255","Anyway, after studying applied arts
at Illinois State University,"
302,"00:20:06,345","00:20:08,302",she returned to Korea.
303,"00:20:08,388","00:20:10,505",Illinois... tell me more.
304,"00:20:10,849","00:20:16,891","Her teaching is unusual,
but she knows how to handle kids."
305,"00:20:17,606","00:20:20,394","She's got a special reputation
in her field."
306,"00:20:20,776","00:20:23,189","But even though
her methods are unique,"
307,"00:20:23,278","00:20:25,816","she can help kids get
into good art schools."
308,"00:20:25,906","00:20:29,946","Now I'm really curious.
What is she like?"
309,"00:20:30,202","00:20:31,784",Would you like to meet her?
310,"00:20:32,079","00:20:35,163","Though I heard she's
in high demand..."
311,"00:20:41,380","00:20:42,621",Hold on.
312,"00:20:44,132","00:20:47,671","Jessica, only child,
Illinois Chicago,"
313,"00:20:47,761","00:20:50,629","classmate Kim Jin-mo,
he's your cousin."
314,"00:20:57,771","00:21:01,811","Look at how he painted the side
dishes on the tablecloth"
315,"00:21:01,942","00:21:04,309",in this mosaic arrangement.
316,"00:21:04,528","00:21:07,236","But within that too,
there are repeating patterns."
317,"00:21:07,406","00:21:10,490","Gochujang is red, the rice...
well, anyway,"
318,"00:21:10,575","00:21:15,491","he has a Basquiat-esque sense,
even at age 9!"
319,"00:21:15,956","00:21:17,413",How exciting.
320,"00:21:17,833","00:21:22,794","I'm sure Miss Jessica
must have already sensed this,"
321,"00:21:23,088","00:21:27,002","so I'll leave you two,
and go up for Da-hye's lesson."
322,"00:21:27,801","00:21:29,258","Have a nice lesson, Jessica."
323,"00:21:29,428","00:21:31,260","Yes, thank you for the introduction."
324,"00:21:35,308","00:21:40,679","So as you can see,
Da-song's eccentric genius..."
325,"00:21:43,442","00:21:44,649",Da-hye.
326,"00:21:44,985","00:21:48,023",So we'll start with #38?
327,"00:21:52,701","00:21:53,862",Kevin.
328,"00:21:53,994","00:21:55,155",Yeah?
329,"00:21:55,328","00:22:00,244","Did you know that Da-song is
faking it all?"
330,"00:22:00,709","00:22:03,076",Huh? What do you mean?
331,"00:22:03,336","00:22:04,998",It's all a show.
332,"00:22:05,213","00:22:08,957","Acting like a genius,
that 4th dimension stuff is all fake."
333,"00:22:09,050","00:22:10,757",An artist cosplay.
334,"00:22:10,969","00:22:12,460",Da-song?
335,"00:22:13,722","00:22:15,304","You know that thing,"
336,"00:22:15,390","00:22:19,509","when he freezes and stares at the sky,
as if struck by inspiration."
337,"00:22:20,187","00:22:25,728","So he's walking along, then he stares
at the clouds for 10 minutes."
338,"00:22:26,276","00:22:28,108",So you know what I mean?
339,"00:22:28,320","00:22:30,812",He gives me the creeps.
340,"00:22:30,989","00:22:34,107","He pretends that he can't live
a normal life."
341,"00:22:34,618","00:22:36,200",Makes me want to puke.
342,"00:22:36,286","00:22:39,324",So Da-song is pretending...
343,"00:22:40,081","00:22:43,825","But what's that got to do
with your studies?"
344,"00:22:47,923","00:22:51,792","Well, I'm just saying."
345,"00:22:54,221","00:22:56,383","Sure, so in that sense,"
346,"00:22:57,516","00:23:01,601","what you told me
about Da-song was very interesting,"
347,"00:23:02,103","00:23:03,969","so let's write about it
in English."
348,"00:23:04,397","00:23:10,234","And be sure to use the word 'pretend'
at least twice."
349,"00:23:10,904","00:23:13,942","Then, can I ask you a question?"
350,"00:23:14,032","00:23:15,148",Sure.
351,"00:23:15,242","00:23:17,734",That teacher Jessica.
352,"00:23:18,495","00:23:24,492",Is she really your cousin's classmate?
353,"00:23:26,753","00:23:28,210",What do you mean?
354,"00:23:28,463","00:23:30,580","She's your girlfriend, right?"
355,"00:23:33,677","00:23:37,717",No way... I just met her today.
356,"00:23:41,768","00:23:44,886","Jessica's really pretty,
isn't she?"
357,"00:23:45,564","00:23:47,476",Aren't you interested?
358,"00:23:48,650","00:23:50,232",You saw her?
359,"00:23:50,485","00:23:54,900","Sure, she's pretty.
She's a beautiful woman."
360,"00:23:55,031","00:23:56,238",Yeah.
361,"00:23:58,159","00:24:01,027",I knew it.
362,"00:24:01,913","00:24:03,870",So you are interested.
363,"00:24:06,668","00:24:08,000",Da-hye...
364,"00:24:10,547","00:24:17,386","So, if we can compare Jessica
to a rose,"
365,"00:24:17,470","00:24:18,961",then you are...
366,"00:25:04,851","00:25:06,513","- Let's study.
- Yes."
367,"00:25:06,603","00:25:11,815","Please understand that
my boy has trouble keeping still."
368,"00:25:11,900","00:25:13,266",I understand.
369,"00:25:13,652","00:25:14,893",Da-song!
370,"00:25:16,154","00:25:17,112","Da-song, get up!"
371,"00:25:17,113","00:25:18,695","Come on, Da-song!"
372,"00:25:18,907","00:25:20,614",In your butt...
373,"00:25:20,700","00:25:23,113","- Madame, please leave us.
- What?"
374,"00:25:23,620","00:25:26,237","I never teach with a parent
in the room."
375,"00:25:26,498","00:25:28,911","But today is our first day,
and as you can see, he's..."
376,"00:25:29,000","00:25:30,707",Wait downstairs.
377,"00:25:32,170","00:25:33,456",Park Da-song?
378,"00:25:33,546","00:25:34,662",Da-song!
379,"00:25:38,677","00:25:39,918",Madame?
380,"00:25:41,096","00:25:42,553",Want some plum extract?
381,"00:25:42,639","00:25:43,675",What?
382,"00:25:43,848","00:25:46,966","It's mixed with honey.
To ease your tension."
383,"00:25:47,102","00:25:49,014","Yeah, that would be great."
384,"00:26:04,077","00:26:05,818","- Hey.
- Yes?"
385,"00:26:06,204","00:26:07,570",I've got an idea.
386,"00:26:07,664","00:26:10,828","Take two glasses of plum
extract to Da-song's room."
387,"00:26:11,084","00:26:14,077","You're not a parent,
so you can go in!"
388,"00:26:14,170","00:26:15,661","Oh, that's right!"
389,"00:26:15,797","00:26:18,881","Then I'll report back on
what's going on in there..."
390,"00:26:19,551","00:26:21,258",Why didn't I think of it earlier?
391,"00:26:23,763","00:26:24,879",What?
392,"00:26:25,140","00:26:26,381",They came out?
393,"00:26:26,891","00:26:27,891",Yeah.
394,"00:26:30,228","00:26:33,312",So you're done already?
395,"00:26:34,733","00:26:35,974",Madame.
396,"00:26:36,651","00:26:38,608",Come sit next to me.
397,"00:26:40,613","00:26:42,400","Da-song, go upstairs."
398,"00:26:44,325","00:26:45,566",Hurry up!
399,"00:26:52,083","00:26:54,040",Da-song just painted this.
400,"00:26:54,127","00:26:55,334",I see...
401,"00:26:57,005","00:26:59,463",I'd rather speak with Madame alone.
402,"00:26:59,758","00:27:00,919","Oh, but she is..."
403,"00:27:01,009","00:27:03,592","No, leave us."
404,"00:27:08,058","00:27:09,390","Madame,"
405,"00:27:09,601","00:27:14,221","I told you I study art psychology
and art therapy?"
406,"00:27:14,314","00:27:15,600",Yes.
407,"00:27:16,274","00:27:18,857","Did anything happen to Da-song
in first grade?"
408,"00:27:21,362","00:27:23,820","To be frank,"
409,"00:27:24,240","00:27:27,483","before I decide whether
to take on Da-song,"
410,"00:27:27,577","00:27:30,035",I need to hear about this.
411,"00:27:30,497","00:27:34,457","But this is hard for me
to talk about right now."
412,"00:27:34,584","00:27:35,584",What to do?
413,"00:27:35,585","00:27:36,951","Never mind, then."
414,"00:27:37,462","00:27:42,674","The lower-right region of a painting is
called the 'schizophrenia zone'."
415,"00:27:42,759","00:27:45,251","Psychotic symptoms
often reveal themselves here."
416,"00:27:45,345","00:27:46,345","Oh, phrenia..."
417,"00:27:46,387","00:27:47,387",Look here.
418,"00:27:47,430","00:27:49,797","Da-song painted this unusual shape,
right?"
419,"00:27:50,100","00:27:51,307",I see.
420,"00:27:53,019","00:27:56,262","Over there, it's the same!
It's the same, right?"
421,"00:27:56,356","00:27:58,222","Yes, that's correct."
422,"00:27:58,650","00:28:02,143","A similar shape in the same zone.
You see it now?"
423,"00:28:02,320","00:28:03,561",Yes.
424,"00:28:04,072","00:28:08,237","I've stared at that painting
at every meal!"
425,"00:28:08,535","00:28:10,652",But I had no idea.
426,"00:28:10,829","00:28:13,663","Calm down.
Let's compose ourselves."
427,"00:28:14,374","00:28:17,412","This is all a black box
into Da-song's mind."
428,"00:28:17,961","00:28:21,420","Would you like to
open that box with me, Madame?"
429,"00:28:22,507","00:28:23,998",I want to open it.
430,"00:28:24,092","00:28:28,632","Then we'll need 4 two-hour sessions
per week,"
431,"00:28:28,721","00:28:32,931","and this is not simple tutoring,
it's art therapy, right?"
432,"00:28:33,017","00:28:34,017",Of course.
433,"00:28:34,102","00:28:37,766","Because of that my rate is
set at a very high level."
434,"00:28:38,606","00:28:39,606",Are you okay with that?
435,"00:28:39,649","00:28:41,015",It's my pleasure.
436,"00:28:42,360","00:28:44,272",Da-song's dad is home.
437,"00:28:50,743","00:28:55,158","Honey, Da-song's new art teacher
is here."
438,"00:28:57,709","00:28:59,792","Her name's Jessica,
from Illinois."
439,"00:29:00,336","00:29:02,578",Jessica! This is Dong-ik.
440,"00:29:02,714","00:29:04,421","- Hello.
- Hi."
441,"00:29:04,632","00:29:06,248",Thanks for your help.
442,"00:29:06,467","00:29:07,583",Class is over?
443,"00:29:07,677","00:29:08,884","Yes, just finished."
444,"00:29:09,262","00:29:10,594","- Driver Yoon.
- Yes?"
445,"00:29:10,680","00:29:12,216","- Are you free?
- Yes, I am."
446,"00:29:12,307","00:29:14,720","Then give her a lift, okay?"
447,"00:29:15,018","00:29:19,479","Sure, we don't want her
going down alone at night, right?"
448,"00:29:19,564","00:29:20,680",Of course.
449,"00:29:20,899","00:29:22,265",Miss Jessica?
450,"00:29:22,775","00:29:28,316","Shall I drive you
all the way home, then?"
451,"00:29:29,407","00:29:31,820","- Which neighborhood?
- No, that's fine."
452,"00:29:31,910","00:29:35,494","You can just drop me off
at Hyehwa station."
453,"00:29:35,830","00:29:36,830",Thank you.
454,"00:29:36,831","00:29:38,322",I don't mind if it's far away.
455,"00:29:38,416","00:29:42,126","- My shift is finished, anyway.
- I'll get off at Hyehwa."
456,"00:29:42,587","00:29:45,625",Looks like it's going to rain.
457,"00:29:47,508","00:29:49,841","Ride the Benz, not the subway!"
458,"00:29:49,928","00:29:53,217","I'm meeting my boyfriend
at exit 3 of Hyehwa Station!"
459,"00:29:54,766","00:29:55,927",Yes.
460,"00:30:30,426","00:30:34,466","Dad, when you worked as a driver,
did you drive a lot of Benzes?"
461,"00:30:35,139","00:30:36,596",Benzes?
462,"00:30:37,141","00:30:41,351","Not then, but I did
when I worked as a valet."
463,"00:30:41,938","00:30:44,646",You worked as a valet?
464,"00:30:44,732","00:30:48,521","Sure, after the chicken place went bust,
before the Taiwan cake shop,"
465,"00:30:48,611","00:30:50,352",in that 6-month window?
466,"00:30:50,446","00:30:53,814","No, it was after the cake shop
went bust."
467,"00:30:56,828","00:30:58,865","We're moving
to the next stage already?"
468,"00:30:59,539","00:31:03,123",I set a trap in the Benz.
469,"00:31:03,209","00:31:04,996",Then we're diving right in.
470,"00:31:05,295","00:31:07,252","Wow, this is so metaphorical."
471,"00:31:07,547","00:31:11,382","Look Dad, we're eating in
a driver's cafeteria right now!"
472,"00:31:11,926","00:31:13,713","Right, a driver's cafeteria!"
473,"00:31:14,178","00:31:16,090","Eat as much as you want, kids."
474,"00:31:16,264","00:31:19,007","You didn't even pay for it,
they did!"
475,"00:31:19,309","00:31:22,347","Son, have some more.
Eat up!"
476,"00:31:22,437","00:31:23,395","Yes, Dad."
477,"00:31:23,396","00:31:24,512",Eat your fill!
478,"00:31:24,605","00:31:26,722","What did you do
to that woman yesterday?"
479,"00:31:26,816","00:31:27,691",What?
480,"00:31:27,692","00:31:29,274",She was freaking out.
481,"00:31:29,444","00:31:31,436","Saying she was so moved,
you put her in shock."
482,"00:31:31,863","00:31:33,195","Fuck, I don't know!"
483,"00:31:33,281","00:31:37,150","I googled 'art therapy',
and ad-libbed the rest."
484,"00:31:37,535","00:31:39,652",Then suddenly she's weeping.
485,"00:31:39,912","00:31:42,154","Crazy bitch,
I couldn't believe it."
486,"00:32:15,573","00:32:17,940","Oh, you're home?"
487,"00:32:18,117","00:32:19,608",Did you eat yet?
488,"00:32:21,579","00:32:23,070",Is something wrong?
489,"00:32:23,164","00:32:24,496",Is the housekeeper out?
490,"00:32:24,582","00:32:26,414",She's walking the dogs.
491,"00:32:27,126","00:32:28,412",Honey.
492,"00:32:29,462","00:32:31,545",This was under my car seat.
493,"00:32:34,092","00:32:36,300",Driver Yoon is such a scumbag.
494,"00:32:36,386","00:32:38,048",What is this?
495,"00:32:38,805","00:32:40,262","I'm sorry, honey."
496,"00:32:40,515","00:32:42,472","I didn't know
he was this kind of guy."
497,"00:32:42,600","00:32:45,217",Don't you pay him well?
498,"00:32:46,062","00:32:48,975","Is he saving up by not paying
for a motel?"
499,"00:32:49,315","00:32:50,851",He must be a pervert.
500,"00:32:50,942","00:32:52,228",He likes it in the car.
501,"00:32:52,318","00:32:56,278","Oh, that's gross.
In his boss' car!"
502,"00:32:56,364","00:33:00,483","A young guy's sex life is
his own business, that's all fine."
503,"00:33:04,330","00:33:06,947",But why in my car?
504,"00:33:08,084","00:33:12,044","And if so, why not in his seat?
Why cross the line like that?"
505,"00:33:12,130","00:33:13,496",You're right.
506,"00:33:13,798","00:33:17,041","Does dripping his sperm
on my seat turn him on?"
507,"00:33:17,218","00:33:19,130",I can't believe this.
508,"00:33:23,766","00:33:27,601","But you know
what's strangest of all?"
509,"00:33:28,646","00:33:29,853",What?
510,"00:33:30,982","00:33:33,269","Usually if you have car sex,"
511,"00:33:33,443","00:33:38,438","you might leave behind
a strand of hair, or an earring."
512,"00:33:38,698","00:33:39,779",Right.
513,"00:33:39,949","00:33:43,408","But how can you forget
your own panties?"
514,"00:33:44,036","00:33:47,825","That's right.
It's hard to overlook."
515,"00:33:49,208","00:33:52,952","So it makes me quite suspicious
of this woman's condition."
516,"00:33:54,297","00:33:55,788",You get me?
517,"00:34:05,349","00:34:06,965",Oh my... meth or cocaine?
518,"00:34:07,059","00:34:08,425",Shh! The kids...
519,"00:34:08,853","00:34:10,344",What do we do?
520,"00:34:10,605","00:34:13,348","What if anyone finds white powder
in your car?"
521,"00:34:13,441","00:34:15,603","Calm down, relax."
522,"00:34:16,360","00:34:17,567",Relax
523,"00:34:18,321","00:34:21,359","For now it's just supposition.
A rational guess."
524,"00:34:22,158","00:34:24,070",But no need to call the police.
525,"00:34:24,160","00:34:25,696",Not that!
526,"00:34:26,496","00:34:31,912","Still, for a busy man like me to ask,
""Why are you fucking in my car?"""
527,"00:34:32,001","00:34:33,492",Exactly.
528,"00:34:33,586","00:34:35,418",So instead...
529,"00:34:35,505","00:34:40,216","Can you just invent some bland
excuse to let him go?"
530,"00:34:40,510","00:34:41,921",Okay sure.
531,"00:34:42,053","00:34:45,091","No need to mention panties
or car sex."
532,"00:34:45,556","00:34:47,548","We don't need to stoop
to that level, do we?"
533,"00:34:47,642","00:34:49,349",Surely not!
534,"00:34:49,977","00:34:53,141","But what if he goes online
and accuses us..."
535,"00:34:53,231","00:34:55,314",Just give him a good severance.
536,"00:34:55,608","00:34:58,726",How was Da-song today?
537,"00:34:59,070","00:35:00,732",He was fine.
538,"00:35:01,447","00:35:03,780","- So class is finished?
- Yes."
539,"00:35:03,866","00:35:06,529","Jessica, the last time you came,"
540,"00:35:06,619","00:35:09,032","our driver gave you a ride,
right?"
541,"00:35:09,121","00:35:10,081",That's right.
542,"00:35:10,082","00:35:12,164","This may be an odd question,"
543,"00:35:12,458","00:35:14,415",but nothing happened then?
544,"00:35:14,502","00:35:15,959","No, he was very nice."
545,"00:35:16,045","00:35:17,832","I told him
to go to Hyehwa Station,"
546,"00:35:17,922","00:35:21,211","but he insisted
on driving me home."
547,"00:35:21,300","00:35:24,384","That jerk!
He took you home late at night?"
548,"00:35:24,470","00:35:26,336",Revealing where you live?
549,"00:35:27,014","00:35:29,381","No, I got off at Hyehwa."
550,"00:35:29,600","00:35:31,808","Oh, good girl. Very good."
551,"00:35:32,103","00:35:33,514",Jessica nice...
552,"00:35:33,646","00:35:36,013",Did something happen with him?
553,"00:35:36,274","00:35:41,360","He won't be working for us anymore.
A slightly shameful incident."
554,"00:35:41,487","00:35:43,479",What incident?
555,"00:35:43,573","00:35:46,156","Oh, you don't need to know."
556,"00:35:47,785","00:35:51,654","But I'm surprised.
He was so gentlemanly and cool."
557,"00:35:51,747","00:35:55,115","Jessica, you're too young
and innocent!"
558,"00:35:55,209","00:35:57,246","You have a lot to learn
about people."
559,"00:35:57,962","00:36:02,923","But we were excited to have such
a young, hip driver, too."
560,"00:36:03,009","00:36:06,173",But isn't an older driver better?
561,"00:36:06,262","00:36:10,131","That's true. They drive better,
have better manners."
562,"00:36:10,391","00:36:13,008","My father's brother had
a driver just like that."
563,"00:36:13,102","00:36:17,688","Mr. Kim.
He was so congenial and nice,"
564,"00:36:17,773","00:36:20,516","I used to call him Uncle
when I was young."
565,"00:36:20,901","00:36:22,267",You know a man like that?
566,"00:36:22,361","00:36:25,069","Yes, he was so mild-mannered."
567,"00:36:25,948","00:36:30,488","Oh, but my relatives relocated
to Chicago."
568,"00:36:31,704","00:36:33,946","I wonder if Mr.
Kim's free now?"
569,"00:36:34,498","00:36:38,037","I'm really interested!
Could I meet him?"
570,"00:36:38,127","00:36:39,243",Really?
571,"00:36:39,712","00:36:41,624",I don't trust anyone now.
572,"00:36:42,131","00:36:45,044","I only trust someone recommended
by a person I know well."
573,"00:36:45,259","00:36:50,004","But if you've known him so long,
I'd feel much more at ease."
574,"00:36:52,516","00:36:54,132",Do you really want to meet him?
575,"00:36:54,977","00:36:56,684",I'm deadly serious.
576,"00:36:56,896","00:37:00,435","This chain of recommendations
is best."
577,"00:37:00,900","00:37:02,391",How should I describe it?
578,"00:37:02,610","00:37:04,067",A belt of trust?
579,"00:37:04,236","00:37:05,522","- This one's different.
- Here."
580,"00:37:05,613","00:37:06,279","Oh, right."
581,"00:37:06,280","00:37:07,646",And this one.
582,"00:37:08,032","00:37:09,614",Looks like a touch screen now.
583,"00:37:09,700","00:37:12,283","It's not touch,
it says you have to turn it."
584,"00:37:12,370","00:37:14,407","Wow, this thing?"
585,"00:37:15,081","00:37:16,117",Sir?
586,"00:37:16,207","00:37:18,290","Taking our time, are we?"
587,"00:37:21,504","00:37:22,961",This is a nice car.
588,"00:37:25,174","00:37:27,166","This is it!
Come over here."
589,"00:37:30,930","00:37:32,592",He's in a meeting now.
590,"00:37:37,311","00:37:39,177",Have a seat and wait here.
591,"00:37:48,030","00:37:51,398","Hello, nice to meet..."
592,"00:37:54,620","00:37:56,156","But is it compatible
with a phone?"
593,"00:37:56,247","00:38:02,585","Oh, not with a phone.
You need more computing power."
594,"00:38:04,004","00:38:08,419","This isn't any sort of test,
so don't be nervous."
595,"00:38:09,260","00:38:12,753","I was worn out at the office,
so I came out for a bit."
596,"00:38:12,888","00:38:14,095",I understand.
597,"00:38:14,265","00:38:18,760","Constant chatter, all that bother.
At least the car is peaceful."
598,"00:38:21,230","00:38:22,516",Thank you.
599,"00:38:23,232","00:38:24,723",You seem to know the roads well?
600,"00:38:24,817","00:38:27,981",Anything below the 38th parallel.
601,"00:38:28,237","00:38:31,571","After 30 years behind the wheel,
the car almost drives itself."
602,"00:38:31,782","00:38:34,525","I respect those who work
in one field for a long time."
603,"00:38:34,910","00:38:37,618","Well, to be honest,
this is a simple vocation."
604,"00:38:37,705","00:38:40,823","But... the head of a household,"
605,"00:38:41,125","00:38:43,162",the leader of a company?
606,"00:38:43,294","00:38:48,039","Or else just a lonely man setting off
on the road each morning..."
607,"00:38:48,758","00:38:50,795","It's companionship of a sort,"
608,"00:38:51,135","00:38:53,969",so that's how I've approached each day.
609,"00:38:54,096","00:38:56,304",The years sure pass quickly.
610,"00:38:59,769","00:39:02,261","Sure enough,
your cornering is excellent."
611,"00:39:03,189","00:39:09,060","Well, it may look simple,
but it's one of the fundamentals."
612,"00:39:09,487","00:39:14,027","She may look like a sheep,
but inside, she's a fox."
613,"00:39:14,450","00:39:17,318","Sometimes she acts like
she owns the house."
614,"00:39:17,953","00:39:18,953",Right.
615,"00:39:18,996","00:39:23,411","Of all the people in that house,
she's lived there the longest."
616,"00:39:23,626","00:39:27,119","She was housekeeper
to the architect Namgoong,"
617,"00:39:27,338","00:39:31,628","but then she went on to work
for this family."
618,"00:39:32,092","00:39:33,879","When the architect moved out,"
619,"00:39:33,969","00:39:36,837","he introduced this woman
to Park's family,"
620,"00:39:36,972","00:39:40,306","telling them, ""This is a great housekeeper,
you should hire her."""
621,"00:39:40,392","00:39:43,726","So she survived
a change of ownership."
622,"00:39:43,813","00:39:46,806","She won't give up
a good job easily."
623,"00:39:47,066","00:39:50,605","To extract a woman like that,
we need to prepare well."
624,"00:39:51,946","00:39:54,529","Right, we need a plan."
625,"00:39:55,699","00:39:58,942","I want to eat peaches.
I like peaches best."
626,"00:39:59,537","00:40:00,948",Why not ask for some?
627,"00:40:01,038","00:40:04,531","No peaches at our house.
It's forbidden fruit."
628,"00:40:12,341","00:40:15,300","So according to
what Da-hye told me,"
629,"00:40:15,469","00:40:19,713","she's got a massively serious
allergy to peaches."
630,"00:40:20,057","00:40:23,175","You know that fuzz
on a peach's skin?"
631,"00:40:23,435","00:40:27,145","If she's anywhere near it,
she gets a full body rash,"
632,"00:40:27,231","00:40:30,975","has trouble breathing, asthma,
a total meltdown!"
633,"00:40:35,656","00:40:39,570","No no, there weren't
any peaches anywhere."
634,"00:40:41,370","00:40:43,703",That's what I'm saying!
635,"00:40:43,998","00:40:46,536","Usually when I get symptoms
like this,"
636,"00:40:46,834","00:40:49,918","I run to my room
and take my medicine,"
637,"00:40:50,129","00:40:55,591","but it was so sudden,
I wasn't sure where I left it."
638,"00:40:55,759","00:41:00,550","Madame, this woman behind me,
is that...?"
639,"00:41:00,806","00:41:02,638","Oh, it's our housekeeper!"
640,"00:41:02,725","00:41:05,058","So it's true. Oh, how sad."
641,"00:41:05,561","00:41:08,269","I wasn't sure
if that was really her."
642,"00:41:08,647","00:41:12,357","I've only seen her a couple times
in the living room."
643,"00:41:12,943","00:41:14,900",This was in the hospital?
644,"00:41:14,987","00:41:18,776","A few days ago I went
for my annual medical exam."
645,"00:41:19,283","00:41:23,493","I took a selfie for my wife,
and there she was behind me."
646,"00:41:23,913","00:41:26,121","Is she talking
on the phone there?"
647,"00:41:26,206","00:41:29,290","Anyway. I wasn't trying
to eavesdrop..."
648,"00:41:29,376","00:41:31,242","I wasn't trying
to eavesdrop,"
649,"00:41:31,337","00:41:33,169","but her words
came through clearly!"
650,"00:41:33,255","00:41:35,042","- So I couldn't help but...!
- Cut, cut!"
651,"00:41:35,132","00:41:38,091","Dad, your emotions are up
to here."
652,"00:41:38,177","00:41:40,419","Bring them down to
about there."
653,"00:41:40,721","00:41:43,429","...so I couldn't help
but overhear."
654,"00:41:43,515","00:41:45,802",Keep it focused!
655,"00:41:47,436","00:41:50,053","What I'm trying to say is,
it's just that,"
656,"00:41:50,147","00:41:54,187","your housekeeper's voice
is quite loud, you know?"
657,"00:41:54,568","00:41:58,061","I understand, it's all right.
Just tell me, okay?"
658,"00:41:58,155","00:42:01,023","She said she got diagnosed
with active TB,"
659,"00:42:01,116","00:42:03,073","and she was shouting
on the phone,"
660,"00:42:03,160","00:42:06,244","so upset she could
barely control herself!"
661,"00:42:06,330","00:42:08,697","Tuberculosis?
Come on..."
662,"00:42:08,791","00:42:13,957","It's true, she phoned someone
saying she had active TB."
663,"00:42:14,421","00:42:19,007",Do people still get TB?
664,"00:42:19,510","00:42:20,510",Dad...
665,"00:42:20,636","00:42:25,722","Back in the day, people used
to buy Christmas Seals, right?"
666,"00:42:25,933","00:42:27,265",Feels like a bygone era.
667,"00:42:27,351","00:42:28,808",But I saw it on the internet.
668,"00:42:29,019","00:42:32,854","Korea has the #1 rate of TB
of all the OECD countries."
669,"00:42:32,940","00:42:36,559","But she's still working,
as if nothing's wrong."
670,"00:42:36,652","00:42:38,564","With a kid like Da-song
in the house."
671,"00:42:38,654","00:42:41,738","So you've got a young kid
like Da-song in the house,"
672,"00:42:42,032","00:42:45,150","and a TB patient is doing dishes,
cooking, spraying spittle..."
673,"00:42:45,244","00:42:46,530","Stop it, please!"
674,"00:42:51,083","00:42:52,824",Dad: Arriving in 3 mins
675,"00:43:39,715","00:43:43,504","If you get the chance,
this'll be icing on the cake."
676,"00:44:13,791","00:44:15,498",Madame
677,"00:44:15,584","00:44:17,371",2nd floor sauna room
678,"00:44:17,461","00:44:18,668",Don't let her see you
679,"00:44:29,098","00:44:30,839","- Have a seat.
- Yes."
680,"00:44:32,810","00:44:33,846",Mr. Kim.
681,"00:44:33,936","00:44:37,896","Please don't tell any of this
to my husband, okay?"
682,"00:44:38,107","00:44:39,143",Understood.
683,"00:44:39,233","00:44:43,603","If he hears I brought
a TB patient to our home,"
684,"00:44:44,071","00:44:46,814",I'll be hanged and quartered!
685,"00:44:46,907","00:44:48,489","Don't worry, Madame."
686,"00:44:48,867","00:44:52,281","And if I may presume
to say one thing."
687,"00:44:52,579","00:44:55,743","I have no feelings
against that woman."
688,"00:44:56,291","00:45:03,291","I felt I had to speak up for the sake
of public health and hygiene."
689,"00:45:03,924","00:45:07,463","But this could be
seen as snitching or..."
690,"00:45:07,553","00:45:08,919",Don't you worry.
691,"00:45:09,012","00:45:11,595",I won't mention the TB.
692,"00:45:11,682","00:45:14,095","I'll just make up some excuse
to dismiss her."
693,"00:45:14,226","00:45:15,967",Simply and quietly.
694,"00:45:17,396","00:45:20,059","It's a proven method.
That's the best."
695,"00:45:20,149","00:45:21,731","Okay, then."
696,"00:45:32,953","00:45:35,821",Have you... washed your hands?
697,"00:46:21,585","00:46:25,795","Mr. Kim, do you know
a good braised ribs place?"
698,"00:46:25,881","00:46:27,417",Somewhere close by.
699,"00:46:27,633","00:46:28,874",Sure.
700,"00:46:29,009","00:46:32,798","- Then you'll be eating out?
- That's right."
701,"00:46:33,430","00:46:36,173","Why such a craving
for braised ribs today?"
702,"00:46:36,642","00:46:39,635",Our old housekeeper made delicious ribs.
703,"00:46:40,562","00:46:43,396",The one who quit this week?
704,"00:46:44,358","00:46:47,817","My wife wouldn't even tell me
why she quit."
705,"00:46:50,614","00:46:55,575","Sure, it's easy enough
to hire a new one."
706,"00:46:56,828","00:47:01,573","Still, it's a shame.
She was a great housekeeper."
707,"00:47:01,667","00:47:02,667",I see.
708,"00:47:02,709","00:47:05,292","She kept the house
in great shape,"
709,"00:47:05,379","00:47:07,996","and she knew never
to cross the line."
710,"00:47:08,590","00:47:11,253","I can't stand people
who cross the line."
711,"00:47:11,843","00:47:14,506",Perhaps just one weak point?
712,"00:47:15,222","00:47:16,804",Eating too much.
713,"00:47:16,932","00:47:19,424",She always ate enough for two.
714,"00:47:20,477","00:47:24,266","But considering all the work
she did..."
715,"00:47:24,439","00:47:29,730","Then you better find someone new.
A new housekeeper."
716,"00:47:29,903","00:47:31,860",We're in trouble now.
717,"00:47:31,989","00:47:36,359","In a week, our house will be
a trash can."
718,"00:47:37,244","00:47:39,987","My clothes will start
to smell."
719,"00:47:41,456","00:47:44,290",My wife has no talent for housework.
720,"00:47:44,501","00:47:47,710","She's bad at cleaning,
and her cooking's awful."
721,"00:47:48,630","00:47:50,747","Still, you love her, right?"
722,"00:47:58,432","00:48:01,516",Of course. I love her.
723,"00:48:02,561","00:48:04,473",We'll call it love.
724,"00:48:06,273","00:48:08,185",Then would this help?
725,"00:48:12,237","00:48:14,604","The Care?
What is this?"
726,"00:48:14,781","00:48:17,148","I just recently found out
about them."
727,"00:48:17,409","00:48:21,949","How to describe it?
It's like a membership service."
728,"00:48:22,789","00:48:29,161","The company provides veteran-grade
help to VIP customers such as you."
729,"00:48:29,338","00:48:35,335","For example maids, caregivers,
or drivers like myself."
730,"00:48:35,427","00:48:38,386","You can tell from the card
they're high-class."
731,"00:48:38,972","00:48:40,588",Cool design.
732,"00:48:41,850","00:48:43,807","Then how do you know
about this company?"
733,"00:48:43,894","00:48:48,229","They contacted me,
as a veteran-grade driver."
734,"00:48:48,482","00:48:50,724",You might say they scouted me?
735,"00:48:51,943","00:48:58,235","But when their call came I had
already arranged to meet with you."
736,"00:48:59,659","00:49:01,025",I see...
737,"00:49:02,162","00:49:05,405","You turned down this famous company
to work for me."
738,"00:49:05,999","00:49:07,661",I won't forget that.
739,"00:49:08,710","00:49:11,077",Son of a bitch!
740,"00:49:13,090","00:49:17,130","Anyway, I can give this card
to my wife, right?"
741,"00:49:17,344","00:49:19,051","Yes, that's why I brought it up."
742,"00:49:19,137","00:49:21,129",No need to mention me.
743,"00:49:22,391","00:49:25,805","You can tell her
you found the company yourself."
744,"00:49:26,395","00:49:27,636",Sure.
745,"00:49:27,979","00:49:30,312","Thanks to you I can play
the good husband."
746,"00:49:30,399","00:49:35,064","On the back, there's a number
for consultations."
747,"00:49:35,278","00:49:36,394",Tell her to call there...
748,"00:49:36,488","00:49:37,774",Eyes on the road!
749,"00:49:42,911","00:49:46,154","Hello, this is
Senior Advisor Yeo of The Care."
750,"00:49:46,456","00:49:49,540","Yes, this is The Care's main office?"
751,"00:49:49,709","00:49:50,709",That's correct.
752,"00:49:50,710","00:49:54,169","If she wanted, she'd be
a fucking great con artist."
753,"00:49:54,256","00:49:56,623","Isn't her voice tone great?
Takes after me."
754,"00:49:58,218","00:50:00,835","From what I've heard,
it's a full membership service?"
755,"00:50:01,012","00:50:04,847","So you're not currently
a member, I assume?"
756,"00:50:04,933","00:50:07,516","That's right. What steps do
I need to take?"
757,"00:50:07,602","00:50:11,721","We'll just need to receive
a few documents from you."
758,"00:50:11,815","00:50:14,728","Are you ready
to write this down?"
759,"00:50:14,901","00:50:19,521","Your family register,
citizenship ID cards..."
760,"00:50:20,532","00:50:23,366","...documents to prove
your income level,"
761,"00:50:23,577","00:50:25,944","i.e. the title to your property, etc."
762,"00:50:26,037","00:50:28,279","Our property title?
Yes."
763,"00:50:36,798","00:50:38,334","Wow, peaches!"
764,"00:50:38,467","00:50:40,208","You have some too, Mr. Kevin."
765,"00:50:40,677","00:50:41,918",Thank you.
766,"00:50:50,520","00:50:52,762","Leave it outside
the door next time."
767,"00:50:52,856","00:50:55,519","- And knock!
- Yes."
768,"00:50:58,361","00:50:59,943",No entering during my lesson!
769,"00:51:00,030","00:51:01,111","Yes, miss!"
770,"00:51:03,658","00:51:04,990",Park Da-song!
771,"00:51:05,076","00:51:06,237",Daddy!
772,"00:51:06,328","00:51:07,785",Where are you?
773,"00:51:12,250","00:51:13,411",Daddy!
774,"00:51:13,502","00:51:14,460",Son!
775,"00:51:14,461","00:51:16,077",Walkie talkies!
776,"00:51:16,171","00:51:17,171",Walkie talkies?
777,"00:51:17,255","00:51:18,255",Walkie talkies!
778,"00:51:18,340","00:51:21,549","Who do you like better,
your dad or the walkie talkie?"
779,"00:51:22,302","00:51:24,840","Da-song, how could you run out
from your lesson?"
780,"00:51:25,222","00:51:28,761",When did you buy all this?
781,"00:51:28,892","00:51:29,928",It's no big deal.
782,"00:51:30,018","00:51:31,099",Huh?
783,"00:51:34,231","00:51:35,267",Huh?
784,"00:51:35,815","00:51:36,931",What is it?
785,"00:51:39,861","00:51:40,977",What's he doing now?
786,"00:51:42,531","00:51:43,612","Da-song, don't do that!"
787,"00:51:43,657","00:51:47,401","It's the same!
They smell the same!"
788,"00:51:47,619","00:51:50,908","What are you talking about?
Go up to Jessica."
789,"00:51:51,289","00:51:55,033","Jessica smells like that, too."
790,"00:51:56,127","00:51:59,746","So do we all need
to use different soap, now?"
791,"00:51:59,839","00:52:03,708","Dad, we'll need to use
different laundry soap, too."
792,"00:52:03,802","00:52:04,963",And fabric softener.
793,"00:52:05,053","00:52:09,172","You mean doing four separate loads
of laundry each time?"
794,"00:52:09,349","00:52:11,090",That's not it.
795,"00:52:12,060","00:52:14,143",It's the semi-basement smell.
796,"00:52:15,105","00:52:17,813","We need to leave this home
to lose the smell."
797,"00:52:19,818","00:52:25,564","Anyway, aren't we fortunate to be
worrying about things like this?"
798,"00:52:25,657","00:52:26,693",Sure.
799,"00:52:26,783","00:52:29,651","In an age like ours,"
800,"00:52:30,078","00:52:34,573","when an opening for a security guard
attracts 500 university graduates."
801,"00:52:34,791","00:52:37,955",Our entire family got hired!
802,"00:52:38,545","00:52:40,161","That's right, Dad!"
803,"00:52:40,672","00:52:43,130",If we put our 4 salaries together?
804,"00:52:43,341","00:52:47,381","The amount of cash coming
from that house into ours is immense!"
805,"00:52:48,305","00:52:52,845","Let's offer a prayer of gratitude
to the great Mr. Park."
806,"00:52:52,934","00:52:54,015",And to Min!
807,"00:52:54,102","00:52:56,845","Ki-woo, that friend of yours
turned into such a fine guy,"
808,"00:52:56,938","00:53:01,182","and thanks to him we're all...
Fuck, not again!"
809,"00:53:05,905","00:53:06,905",That asshole's dead.
810,"00:53:06,990","00:53:09,482",Ki-woo's on the rampage!
811,"00:53:09,576","00:53:11,738",Don't overdo it!
812,"00:53:12,954","00:53:15,492",Use this instead.
813,"00:53:19,252","00:53:20,493",Damn you!
814,"00:53:23,298","00:53:24,584",Get a fucking grip!
815,"00:53:24,674","00:53:26,165",Get a grip!
816,"00:53:28,678","00:53:30,044",Wow!
817,"00:53:34,351","00:53:36,559",It's a deluge!
818,"00:53:52,827","00:53:57,162","Current weather is clear, over.
The clouds are moving."
819,"00:53:57,248","00:53:59,661","But they're not rain clouds,
over."
820,"00:53:59,751","00:54:01,162","I hear you, over."
821,"00:54:01,252","00:54:07,419","Currently your sister's lip is
pouting like a duck's bill."
822,"00:54:07,634","00:54:10,377","She's super annoyed, over."
823,"00:54:10,720","00:54:15,306","Can't I stay home and study English?
And call Kevin?"
824,"00:54:15,517","00:54:18,931","Hey! Don't make a scene
just as we're leaving."
825,"00:54:19,020","00:54:21,353","If we have to go,
let's have fun."
826,"00:54:21,439","00:54:24,102","Da-hye, this is no ordinary
camping trip."
827,"00:54:24,192","00:54:25,025",That's right!
828,"00:54:25,026","00:54:27,143","How could you miss
your brother's birthday?"
829,"00:54:27,237","00:54:27,986",No way!
830,"00:54:27,987","00:54:30,229","Even your busy father is
taking time off to go."
831,"00:54:30,323","00:54:33,111","Right! If you don't go,
you'll regret it!"
832,"00:54:35,495","00:54:37,657","Oh, right.
You know the beam projector?"
833,"00:54:37,747","00:54:38,747",The outdoor theater?
834,"00:54:38,832","00:54:40,698","Right, bring the outdoor
beam projector."
835,"00:54:40,792","00:54:41,584",Yes.
836,"00:54:41,585","00:54:45,703","And look for Da-song's
camping raincoat."
837,"00:54:45,880","00:54:47,587",He loves it when it rains.
838,"00:54:48,216","00:54:52,176","You remember now?
Zoonie, Berry, and Foofoo."
839,"00:54:52,262","00:54:53,423",Zoonie and Berry get this.
840,"00:54:53,513","00:54:56,301","Yes, Natural Balance Original Ultra."
841,"00:54:56,391","00:54:58,678","Right, and for Foofoo..."
842,"00:54:59,060","00:55:00,676","Kani-kamaboko.
Japanese crab sticks."
843,"00:55:00,770","00:55:01,770",Yes.
844,"00:55:01,771","00:55:04,809","When you walk Zoonie,
give him a long leash."
845,"00:55:04,899","00:55:07,687","He needs to run around
to feel happy."
846,"00:55:07,777","00:55:10,394","He's like the canine version
of Da-song!"
847,"00:55:36,222","00:55:37,713",Son!
848,"00:55:38,183","00:55:40,926",Why are you lying down outside?
849,"00:55:41,186","00:55:43,769",Isn't he hot out there?
850,"00:55:44,731","00:55:49,351","I'm gazing at the sky
from home."
851,"00:55:50,987","00:55:52,444",It's so great.
852,"00:55:55,867","00:55:58,029","Mom, want some water?"
853,"00:55:58,119","00:55:59,326","There's sparkling, right?"
854,"00:55:59,621","00:56:02,113","Ki-jung, some water?"
855,"00:56:02,207","00:56:04,199",Telepathy... thank you.
856,"00:56:26,523","00:56:27,764",Whoa.
857,"00:56:30,527","00:56:33,190","Wow, all these varieties
of alcohol."
858,"00:56:34,155","00:56:38,399","Dad! Let me add another
to the mix!"
859,"00:56:40,286","00:56:41,948",This is pretty classy.
860,"00:56:42,872","00:56:47,537","Rain falling on the lawn,
as we sip our whiskey..."
861,"00:56:48,127","00:56:52,872","Ki-woo, what's that yellow notebook
you've been carrying?"
862,"00:56:53,550","00:56:56,964","This?
It's Da-hye's diary."
863,"00:56:57,053","00:56:58,589",Her diary?
864,"00:56:58,680","00:57:02,799","What a scumbag.
How could you read her diary?"
865,"00:57:03,393","00:57:08,764","Just so we can understand
each other deeper."
866,"00:57:08,857","00:57:11,315","Fuck, are you two dating?"
867,"00:57:11,776","00:57:15,770","I'm serious.
She really likes me too."
868,"00:57:17,907","00:57:19,364",A while back...
869,"00:57:20,243","00:57:21,450",Never mind.
870,"00:57:22,537","00:57:25,496","When she enters university,
I'll officially ask her out."
871,"00:57:25,832","00:57:27,118",Seriously.
872,"00:57:31,796","00:57:33,503",My son!
873,"00:57:34,007","00:57:38,342","Then this house will be
your in-laws' house?"
874,"00:57:40,847","00:57:41,928",That's right.
875,"00:57:42,015","00:57:45,975","Fuck, then I'm washing dishes
at my daughter-in-law's?"
876,"00:57:46,060","00:57:49,303","Sure, washing
your daughter-in-law's socks!"
877,"00:58:01,200","00:58:06,286","I like her.
She's a good kid."
878,"00:58:06,789","00:58:10,783","She's pretty,
but she's not wild."
879,"00:58:11,836","00:58:16,080","Well, now that we're daydreaming..."
880,"00:58:17,342","00:58:19,880","If Da-hye and I marry,"
881,"00:58:20,094","00:58:23,804","we can bring in actors
to be my mom and dad."
882,"00:58:24,724","00:58:25,885",Look at her.
883,"00:58:26,017","00:58:29,510","She got so many jobs acting
in weddings last year."
884,"00:58:31,022","00:58:34,106","I even caught the bouquet
from a bitch I've never met."
885,"00:58:34,359","00:58:37,318","If you get the bouquet,
they pay an extra $10."
886,"00:58:37,445","00:58:39,562",That's how your acting got so good!
887,"00:58:39,656","00:58:45,027","Acting is one thing,
but this family is so gullible, right?"
888,"00:58:45,119","00:58:47,327",The madame especially.
889,"00:58:47,413","00:58:49,029",You said it.
890,"00:58:50,959","00:58:54,168","She's so naive, and nice."
891,"00:58:54,504","00:58:56,587","She's rich, but still nice."
892,"00:58:56,673","00:58:58,881","Not ""rich, but still nice."""
893,"00:58:59,050","00:59:02,714","""Nice because she's rich.""
You know?"
894,"00:59:03,221","00:59:09,718","Hell, if I had all this money."
895,"00:59:10,937","00:59:14,681",I'd be nice too!
896,"00:59:15,149","00:59:16,560",Even nicer!
897,"00:59:16,901","00:59:18,938","That's true.
Your mom's right."
898,"00:59:19,278","00:59:21,520","Rich people are naive.
No resentments."
899,"00:59:21,739","00:59:24,072",No creases on them.
900,"00:59:24,158","00:59:27,242","It all gets ironed out.
Money is an iron."
901,"00:59:27,495","00:59:29,987",Those creases all get smoothed out.
902,"00:59:30,123","00:59:31,364","Hey, Ki-woo."
903,"00:59:32,208","00:59:36,873","You know that driver, Yoon?
Was it Yoon?"
904,"00:59:37,547","00:59:39,834",The driver before me.
905,"00:59:40,174","00:59:41,335","Yeah, Yoon."
906,"00:59:41,426","00:59:46,012","He must be working somewhere else now,
right?"
907,"00:59:46,097","00:59:48,430","Sure, he must be."
908,"00:59:48,516","00:59:51,759","He's young, got a nice physique."
909,"00:59:52,353","00:59:55,221",He must've found a better job.
910,"00:59:55,314","00:59:57,556",Fucking hell!
911,"00:59:58,401","01:00:00,563",What's with her now?
912,"01:00:01,070","01:00:07,067","We're the ones who need help.
Worry about us, okay?"
913,"01:00:07,577","01:00:10,786","Dad! Come on, Dad!"
914,"01:00:11,080","01:00:15,324","Just focus on us, okay?
On us!"
915,"01:00:15,543","01:00:19,878","Not Driver Yoon, but me, please!"
916,"01:00:20,006","01:00:22,089","Awesome timing, huh?"
917,"01:00:22,216","01:00:25,960","She speaks,
and the lightning crashes!"
918,"01:00:28,056","01:00:30,890","Hey, Jessica. Cheers."
919,"01:00:31,768","01:00:37,560","Hey, when I went up before,
and you were in the bath..."
920,"01:00:37,648","01:00:39,230",What about it?
921,"01:00:40,109","01:00:43,273","How to put it?
You fit in here."
922,"01:00:43,613","01:00:46,526","This rich house suits you.
Not like us."
923,"01:00:46,616","01:00:47,532",Fuck off.
924,"01:00:47,533","01:00:48,451",I'm serious!
925,"01:00:48,452","01:00:50,192","Dad, before..."
926,"01:00:50,286","01:00:52,949","She was lying back in the tub,
watching TV."
927,"01:00:53,498","01:00:55,831",Like she's lived here for years.
928,"01:00:57,794","01:01:03,631","Speaking of which,
if this became our house,"
929,"01:01:03,758","01:01:07,877","if we lived here,
which room would you want?"
930,"01:01:08,096","01:01:13,182","What room in this masterwork
by the great Namgoong?"
931,"01:01:13,392","01:01:15,304","Fuck, I don't know."
932,"01:01:15,394","01:01:19,058","Get me the house first.
Then I'll think about it."
933,"01:01:19,398","01:01:21,640","We live here now, don't we?"
934,"01:01:22,110","01:01:25,899",Getting drunk in the living room.
935,"01:01:26,030","01:01:29,068","Right, we live here.
Why not?"
936,"01:01:29,200","01:01:33,615","This is our home right now.
It's cosy."
937,"01:01:33,830","01:01:36,743",Cosy? Are you feeling cosy?
938,"01:01:36,958","01:01:41,828","Sure, but suppose Park walked
through that door now."
939,"01:01:42,421","01:01:43,832",What about your dad?
940,"01:01:43,965","01:01:47,299",He'd run and hide like a cockroach.
941,"01:01:47,802","01:01:50,294","Kids, you know at our house,"
942,"01:01:50,388","01:01:55,975","when you turn on the light,
and the cockroaches scatter?"
943,"01:01:56,185","01:01:57,926",You know what I mean?
944,"01:01:58,563","01:02:01,681",I'm getting fucking tired of this.
945,"01:02:02,441","01:02:04,273","- A cockroach?
- Yeah."
946,"01:02:08,030","01:02:09,692",Huh? What's wrong?
947,"01:02:09,782","01:02:11,114",What's the matter?
948,"01:02:11,200","01:02:14,784","Dad, don't do that.
You only live once."
949,"01:02:22,086","01:02:23,793",What the hell?
950,"01:02:24,046","01:02:25,582","I fooled you!
Didn't I?"
951,"01:02:25,673","01:02:27,039","Jesus, Dad."
952,"01:02:27,133","01:02:31,298","I fooled you too, Ki-woo?
Did it look for real?"
953,"01:02:31,387","01:02:34,801","If it was for real,
I'd fucking kill you."
954,"01:02:35,183","01:02:38,802","What is this?
Fucking puppy."
955,"01:02:44,567","01:02:46,650",Who is it at this hour?
956,"01:02:46,944","01:02:48,526",What is it?
957,"01:02:55,077","01:02:56,409",What's she doing here?
958,"01:02:56,621","01:02:58,908",The old housekeeper?
959,"01:02:59,624","01:03:01,286",What's she here for?
960,"01:03:01,834","01:03:05,953",She won't stop ringing it.
961,"01:03:06,839","01:03:09,673",Raising a racket.
962,"01:03:11,135","01:03:12,135",Who is it?
963,"01:03:12,136","01:03:16,631","Oh, hello! I'm..."
964,"01:03:17,016","01:03:18,678","The madame's not in, right?"
965,"01:03:18,768","01:03:19,768",What?
966,"01:03:19,769","01:03:24,139","I worked here
for a very long time."
967,"01:03:24,690","01:03:30,436","Above the monitor there,
you see a photo of 3 dogs, right?"
968,"01:03:30,529","01:03:31,940","Zoonie, Berry, Foofoo."
969,"01:03:32,031","01:03:36,321","I get it,
but why are you here?"
970,"01:03:36,577","01:03:41,038","You're my successor
as housekeeper, right?"
971,"01:03:46,170","01:03:47,706",Anyway...
972,"01:03:48,673","01:03:51,791","I'm very sorry
to call on you so late."
973,"01:03:52,051","01:03:53,508",It's just that...
974,"01:03:54,095","01:04:01,095","I forgot something in the basement
under the kitchen."
975,"01:04:01,644","01:04:07,732","When I left, they pushed me out
so quickly..."
976,"01:04:11,237","01:04:13,069",Would you let me in?
977,"01:04:15,366","01:04:17,028",What do we do?
978,"01:04:17,868","01:04:19,951",This isn't in the plan.
979,"01:04:27,712","01:04:29,499",Sorry for the trouble.
980,"01:04:30,047","01:04:31,083",This way.
981,"01:04:31,173","01:04:32,209","Yes, thank you."
982,"01:04:34,593","01:04:36,801",You can put your raincoat...
983,"01:04:36,887","01:04:39,049",It'll just be a second.
984,"01:04:40,057","01:04:43,550","Quite a meal there.
That'll be a job to clean up."
985,"01:04:43,728","01:04:46,812",But what did you leave below?
986,"01:04:51,527","01:04:53,769",Want to come down with me?
987,"01:04:55,239","01:04:58,277","Well, just go ahead."
988,"01:05:51,587","01:05:54,671",Help me push this!
989,"01:05:55,216","01:05:57,708",Pull it! From over there.
990,"01:05:57,802","01:05:59,043",What?
991,"01:05:59,303","01:06:00,464",Pull!
992,"01:06:02,890","01:06:04,506",Pull it hard!
993,"01:06:08,437","01:06:09,848",Are you okay?
994,"01:06:11,148","01:06:12,730",Did I scare you?
995,"01:06:15,027","01:06:16,484",Thank you!
996,"01:06:17,863","01:06:19,195",Thank you.
997,"01:06:27,373","01:06:28,373",Honey!
998,"01:06:28,416","01:06:29,873",What the hell?
999,"01:06:30,918","01:06:31,999",Hey!
1000,"01:06:32,086","01:06:33,418",Honey!
1001,"01:06:34,630","01:06:35,962",Honey!
1002,"01:06:38,634","01:06:39,670",Wait!
1003,"01:06:39,802","01:06:41,919","Honey, I'm here!"
1004,"01:06:42,138","01:06:43,629",What is all this?
1005,"01:06:45,850","01:06:46,931",Honey!
1006,"01:06:47,268","01:06:48,930","Honey, I'm fine."
1007,"01:06:49,019","01:06:50,726",No you're not!
1008,"01:06:51,021","01:06:52,102","I'm fine, really."
1009,"01:06:52,189","01:06:53,350",How can you say that?
1010,"01:06:53,441","01:06:55,182",But I'm really hungry.
1011,"01:06:55,276","01:06:56,276",Suck it!
1012,"01:06:56,318","01:06:59,311",How many days has it been?
1013,"01:06:59,572","01:07:01,279",You must've been so hungry!
1014,"01:07:03,325","01:07:04,611",It's okay.
1015,"01:07:04,702","01:07:07,445",She's a nice woman. She let me in.
1016,"01:07:07,538","01:07:09,575","There was an iron plate,
for grilling meat."
1017,"01:07:09,665","01:07:11,201",It was wedged under the shelf.
1018,"01:07:11,292","01:07:12,328",So that's why.
1019,"01:07:12,418","01:07:15,752","I couldn't open it
from the inside."
1020,"01:07:16,005","01:07:19,043","- What's going on here?
- I know you must be startled."
1021,"01:07:19,592","01:07:21,959",I would be too in this situation.
1022,"01:07:22,136","01:07:26,881","But as two fellow workers...
Right, Chung-sook?"
1023,"01:07:26,974","01:07:29,762",How do you know my name?
1024,"01:07:30,269","01:07:34,889","To be honest I'm still texting
with the boy Da-song."
1025,"01:07:35,107","01:07:39,647","I knew they were going camping,
so I came today."
1026,"01:07:39,778","01:07:42,395",I wanted to speak to you alone.
1027,"01:07:42,656","01:07:44,022",Talking about.
1028,"01:07:46,160","01:07:48,573","Don't worry, Chung-sook."
1029,"01:07:48,746","01:07:52,160","I cut the wire
on the CCTV by the gate."
1030,"01:07:52,541","01:07:56,251","Nobody knows I came.
Isn't that good, sis?"
1031,"01:07:56,337","01:07:58,374",Don't call me sis!
1032,"01:07:58,464","01:08:01,377","Sis, my name is Moon-gwang."
1033,"01:08:01,634","01:08:06,004","This is my hubbie Oh Geun-sae.
Say hello, honey."
1034,"01:08:06,096","01:08:09,464","This tastes great.
What happened to your face?"
1035,"01:08:09,558","01:08:12,847",I'll tell you later.
1036,"01:08:12,937","01:08:16,897","So you'd steal food every day
while working in the kitchen."
1037,"01:08:16,982","01:08:18,223",Feeding your husband.
1038,"01:08:18,317","01:08:22,652","Not at all! I bought all his food
with my salary."
1039,"01:08:22,780","01:08:25,818",That's so unfair!
1040,"01:08:26,033","01:08:28,571","But how long has
your husband been down here?"
1041,"01:08:28,661","01:08:31,119","Hold on a sec.
4 years?"
1042,"01:08:32,039","01:08:34,782","4 years, 3 months and 17 days."
1043,"01:08:34,875","01:08:36,707","Right, it's June now."
1044,"01:08:37,169","01:08:43,040","Four years ago
when Mr. Namgoong moved to Paris,"
1045,"01:08:43,342","01:08:46,005","in the time before Mr. Park's family
moved in,"
1046,"01:08:46,554","01:08:50,047",I brought my husband down here.
1047,"01:08:50,140","01:08:54,976","Many rich houses have secret bunkers,
where you can hide"
1048,"01:08:55,145","01:08:59,765","in case North Korea attacks,
or if creditors break in."
1049,"01:08:59,900","01:09:05,862","But it seems Mr. Namgoong was
a bit embarrassed about this,"
1050,"01:09:06,073","01:09:09,817","because he never mentioned it
to Mr. Park's family."
1051,"01:09:09,994","01:09:11,451",So only I know about it.
1052,"01:09:11,537","01:09:13,824",So that's how it happened.
1053,"01:09:14,123","01:09:18,333","But now that I know, I've no choice
but to call the police!"
1054,"01:09:18,419","01:09:20,251","No please, sis!"
1055,"01:09:20,629","01:09:23,667","As fellow members of the needy,
please don't."
1056,"01:09:23,757","01:09:25,248",I'm not needy!
1057,"01:09:25,342","01:09:29,052",But we're needy!
1058,"01:09:29,138","01:09:33,382","We've no house, no money,
only debts!"
1059,"01:09:33,642","01:09:34,883","Sis, please!"
1060,"01:09:34,977","01:09:39,438","Even after 4 years of hiding,
those debt collectors won't give up."
1061,"01:09:39,523","01:09:43,733","They're still searching for him,
threatening to stab him."
1062,"01:09:43,819","01:09:45,355",You used loan sharks?
1063,"01:09:46,238","01:09:48,104",It's all my fault.
1064,"01:09:48,699","01:09:50,190",The Taiwan cake shop.
1065,"01:09:50,534","01:09:54,574","My Taiwanese Wangshui
castella shop went bust."
1066,"01:09:54,705","01:09:56,788",I was overwhelmed by debt.
1067,"01:09:56,957","01:09:58,539",Please take this.
1068,"01:09:58,876","01:10:00,333",What's that?
1069,"01:10:00,502","01:10:04,667","It's not much,
just a modest sum."
1070,"01:10:04,757","01:10:07,420","But we'll send it
to you every month."
1071,"01:10:07,968","01:10:09,800","In return,
just once every 2 days,"
1072,"01:10:09,887","01:10:12,880",please leave him some food.
1073,"01:10:13,641","01:10:16,554","No no, just once a week."
1074,"01:10:17,102","01:10:19,344","There's a refrigerator here.
Just once a week."
1075,"01:10:19,438","01:10:22,556","You've got some nerve!
I'm calling the police."
1076,"01:10:22,650","01:10:23,650",Sis!
1077,"01:10:25,986","01:10:27,272",Who is that?
1078,"01:10:30,407","01:10:32,069",Wait... Jessica?
1079,"01:10:32,868","01:10:34,029",Mr. Kim?
1080,"01:10:34,119","01:10:35,200",What the hell?
1081,"01:10:36,538","01:10:37,779","Dad, my ankle!"
1082,"01:10:37,873","01:10:38,989","You okay?
Sorry."
1083,"01:10:39,083","01:10:41,166","Dad, my foot."
1084,"01:10:41,251","01:10:43,038",Don't call me Dad!
1085,"01:10:50,052","01:10:53,966","I thought it was weird
when the driver was fired."
1086,"01:10:54,848","01:10:55,556",Hey!
1087,"01:10:55,557","01:10:57,924","- Let's talk things over.
- What the hell?"
1088,"01:10:58,018","01:10:59,429",Are you some family of charlatans?
1089,"01:10:59,520","01:11:00,478","So, sis..."
1090,"01:11:00,479","01:11:02,766","Don't fucking call me sis,
you filthy bitch!"
1091,"01:11:03,190","01:11:08,231","I'm gonna send this video
to the madame, how about that?"
1092,"01:11:08,320","01:11:10,277","Dad, my foot."
1093,"01:11:10,489","01:11:12,697","No reception in the basement,
right?"
1094,"01:11:13,367","01:11:15,233","- The phone works fine.
- Fuck."
1095,"01:11:15,327","01:11:20,038","Ma'am, to be honest,
the jobs we have here..."
1096,"01:11:20,124","01:11:23,037","Shut up!
It's too late now!"
1097,"01:11:23,127","01:11:26,461","Let's all go to jail!
We're fucking going down!"
1098,"01:11:26,547","01:11:29,460","Lady, are you crazy?"
1099,"01:11:30,300","01:11:35,170","If they see that video, Mr. Park
and his wife will be so shocked!"
1100,"01:11:35,556","01:11:38,720","What did those nice people
ever do wrong?"
1101,"01:11:39,560","01:11:40,560",Why do this to them?
1102,"01:11:40,602","01:11:41,809",Stop right there!
1103,"01:11:42,187","01:11:44,304",Or I'll push the 'send' button.
1104,"01:11:44,732","01:11:46,098",Follow me.
1105,"01:11:46,859","01:11:49,272","Calm down, ma'am."
1106,"01:11:52,906","01:11:54,863",Don't push!
1107,"01:11:56,118","01:11:57,700","Let's go up, honey."
1108,"01:11:58,120","01:12:00,783",Time for you to get some fresh air!
1109,"01:12:18,098","01:12:24,095","Honey, this 'send' button is
like a missile launcher."
1110,"01:12:24,688","01:12:26,475","What do you mean, honey?"
1111,"01:12:27,107","01:12:32,227","If we threaten to push it,
those people can't do anything."
1112,"01:12:32,362","01:12:36,697","It's like a North Korean rocket.
A North Korean missile button!"
1113,"01:12:38,118","01:12:41,862","Today our beloved
Great Leader Kim Jong-un,"
1114,"01:12:41,997","01:12:45,081","after witnessing
the charlatan family video,"
1115,"01:12:45,167","01:12:47,830","was unable to contain
his shock and fury"
1116,"01:12:47,920","01:12:51,084","at their wicked,
despicable provocation!"
1117,"01:12:51,173","01:12:53,130","I've missed your jokes, honey!"
1118,"01:12:53,217","01:12:57,757","Therefore our Great Leader,
in this age of denuclearization,"
1119,"01:12:57,846","01:13:03,592","has commanded that the nation's
last remaining nuclear warhead"
1120,"01:13:03,685","01:13:06,223","be driven down the throats
of this wicked family!"
1121,"01:13:06,313","01:13:10,978","No one can imitate North Korean
news anchors like you!"
1122,"01:13:11,068","01:13:16,314","With their stinking guts serving
as the last nuclear graveyard,"
1123,"01:13:16,406","01:13:21,071","our Dear Leader's wish to denuclearize
and bring world peace can..."
1124,"01:13:21,161","01:13:22,948","Hands in the air, fuckers!"
1125,"01:13:23,372","01:13:24,783",Higher!
1126,"01:13:26,708","01:13:28,745",You scumbag family.
1127,"01:13:28,836","01:13:29,952",Husband?
1128,"01:13:30,170","01:13:30,962",Husband.
1129,"01:13:30,963","01:13:31,921",Wife?
1130,"01:13:31,922","01:13:32,797",Yes.
1131,"01:13:32,798","01:13:34,460","- Son?
- Yes."
1132,"01:13:34,550","01:13:35,791","- Daughter?
- Daughter."
1133,"01:13:35,884","01:13:37,671",You neanderthals.
1134,"01:13:37,970","01:13:42,055","Is that all you can think to do,
drink yourselves stupid?"
1135,"01:13:42,432","01:13:47,473","In this home suffused
with Mr. Namgoong's creative spirit?"
1136,"01:13:47,729","01:13:48,810",You cretins!
1137,"01:13:48,897","01:13:50,263",What do you know about art?
1138,"01:13:50,357","01:13:52,474",What would they know?
1139,"01:13:53,277","01:14:00,277","When the sun was nice,
we'd bask in those sunbeams, right?"
1140,"01:14:01,910","01:14:06,200","At such moments we could feel
his artistic touch."
1141,"01:14:53,962","01:14:57,296",Give it to me!
1142,"01:15:16,485","01:15:20,229","Good job!
Delete it!"
1143,"01:15:21,073","01:15:24,066","Careful, don't send it by accident."
1144,"01:15:38,507","01:15:39,793",Hello?
1145,"01:15:40,258","01:15:43,922","Listen, do you know
how to make ram-don?"
1146,"01:15:44,388","01:15:45,595",Ram-don?
1147,"01:15:45,681","01:15:49,095","Da-song likes ram-don
more than anything."
1148,"01:15:49,476","01:15:52,890","If you boil the water now,
the timing will be perfect."
1149,"01:15:53,313","01:15:56,021","There's sirloin in the fridge,
add that too."
1150,"01:15:56,108","01:15:57,724","Then, the camping...?"
1151,"01:15:57,818","01:16:01,277","My god, what a disaster."
1152,"01:16:01,947","01:16:07,113","The river overflowed and
everyone was packing their tents,"
1153,"01:16:07,369","01:16:10,282","but Da-song was crying
and refusing to go home."
1154,"01:16:10,497","01:16:14,366","Anyway, ram-don as soon
as we walk in, okay?"
1155,"01:16:14,835","01:16:17,168",Then you're almost here?
1156,"01:16:17,295","01:16:19,753","8 minutes, according to the GPS."
1157,"01:16:20,257","01:16:21,338",You arrive in 8 minutes...
1158,"01:16:21,425","01:16:24,918","Start boiling
the water right away!"
1159,"01:16:29,099","01:16:30,806",What the hell is ram-don?
1160,"01:16:39,818","01:16:41,480","Move, quickly!"
1161,"01:16:42,571","01:16:44,278",Hurry!
1162,"01:16:51,204","01:16:52,991",Ramen / Udon
1163,"01:16:54,875","01:16:57,583","Dad, I can't drag her any further!"
1164,"01:17:08,597","01:17:10,463",What are you doing?
1165,"01:17:12,017","01:17:13,474",Dad!
1166,"01:17:16,813","01:17:19,726","Go up quickly!
Help upstairs."
1167,"01:17:27,574","01:17:28,815",Take this!
1168,"01:17:48,053","01:17:49,260",Welcome home!
1169,"01:17:49,346","01:17:52,714","Da-song, look!
Let's eat ram-don!"
1170,"01:17:54,768","01:17:56,100",Da-song!
1171,"01:17:59,064","01:18:00,930",Da-song!
1172,"01:18:07,280","01:18:08,737",Madame!
1173,"01:18:27,092","01:18:29,334","Why don't you
just eat the ram-don?"
1174,"01:18:29,427","01:18:30,344",Shall I?
1175,"01:18:30,345","01:18:33,383","No wait. I can give it
to my husband."
1176,"01:18:33,473","01:18:35,385",There's sirloin in here.
1177,"01:18:37,936","01:18:41,600","It's cooked through?
Medium well done."
1178,"01:19:06,798","01:19:12,635","Returning after a day's work...
I love you so much, Mr. Park!"
1179,"01:19:12,804","01:19:18,971","Home from the office,
Mr. Park is off duty now."
1180,"01:19:21,062","01:19:25,352","Returning after a day's work...
I love you so much, Mr. Park!"
1181,"01:19:25,442","01:19:27,354","- What are you doing?
- Shut up!"
1182,"01:19:38,914","01:19:41,281","Honey, do you want some ram-don?"
1183,"01:19:41,541","01:19:42,577",Da-song doesn't want it?
1184,"01:19:42,667","01:19:43,375",No.
1185,"01:19:43,376","01:19:45,413","No, I'm tired.
I'm going to bed."
1186,"01:19:45,670","01:19:48,413",Why are you staring?
1187,"01:19:49,633","01:19:53,172","Mr. Park, you feed me
and house me."
1188,"01:19:53,261","01:19:54,593",Respect!
1189,"01:19:56,681","01:19:58,422",You do this every day?
1190,"01:19:58,975","01:20:04,266","Sure, I even send whole sentences
to thank him."
1191,"01:20:04,856","01:20:07,098",Someone of your age should know it.
1192,"01:20:07,192","01:20:08,192",Know what?
1193,"01:20:08,235","01:20:09,851",Morse Code.
1194,"01:20:10,528","01:20:14,272",That sensor's going batty.
1195,"01:20:22,749","01:20:26,083","Da-song will know it,
since he's a Scout."
1196,"01:20:26,336","01:20:27,793","It's ridiculous, right?"
1197,"01:20:28,171","01:20:31,414","Running around,
trying to please a kid."
1198,"01:20:31,716","01:20:33,548",He's not some kind of prince.
1199,"01:20:33,802","01:20:36,260",He's the youngest. It's common.
1200,"01:20:37,555","01:20:39,091",Please understand.
1201,"01:20:39,599","01:20:43,092",Da-song is a bit... unwell.
1202,"01:20:43,645","01:20:46,433","He's receiving trauma therapy
and art therapy."
1203,"01:20:47,607","01:20:49,564",There was an incident.
1204,"01:20:49,693","01:20:51,059",What incident?
1205,"01:20:51,486","01:20:54,775","Sis, you believe in ghosts, too?"
1206,"01:20:56,449","01:20:59,942","Da-song saw a ghost in the house
when he was in 1st grade."
1207,"01:21:06,543","01:21:09,126","He had a birthday party
at home that day."
1208,"01:21:09,421","01:21:11,879","Late that night,
when everyone was sleeping,"
1209,"01:21:11,965","01:21:16,209","Da-song crept down to the kitchen
and took the cake out."
1210,"01:21:16,636","01:21:19,549","The whipped cream
on that cake was amazing."
1211,"01:21:19,764","01:21:22,347","Even in bed, he couldn't stop
thinking about it."
1212,"01:21:22,976","01:21:28,347","So Da-song was sitting,
eating his cake..."
1213,"01:21:38,074","01:21:40,987","He screamed,
and I ran downstairs,"
1214,"01:21:41,619","01:21:43,406",and he was all...
1215,"01:21:44,122","01:21:49,288","his eyes rolled back in his head,
convulsions, foam in his mouth."
1216,"01:21:51,463","01:21:53,750","Have you ever seen
a child have a seizure?"
1217,"01:21:53,840","01:21:54,758",No.
1218,"01:21:54,759","01:21:59,719","They need 15-minute treatment,
or they're done for."
1219,"01:22:00,013","01:22:04,303","That's the time you have to reach
an emergency room, 15 minutes."
1220,"01:22:05,477","01:22:10,939","How can you live
in a place like this?"
1221,"01:22:11,066","01:22:14,104","Well, lots of people
live underground."
1222,"01:22:14,361","01:22:16,227","Especially if you count
semi-basements."
1223,"01:22:16,321","01:22:20,611","What'll you do?
You don't have a plan?"
1224,"01:22:21,159","01:22:24,402",I just feel comfortable here.
1225,"01:22:25,830","01:22:28,618",It feels like I was born here.
1226,"01:22:29,667","01:22:32,660","Maybe I had my wedding here, too."
1227,"01:22:33,129","01:22:36,088","As for the National Pension,
I don't qualify."
1228,"01:22:37,550","01:22:40,884","In my old age,
love will comfort me."
1229,"01:22:42,680","01:22:47,721","So please.
Let me live down here."
1230,"01:22:49,687","01:22:51,019",Anyway...
1231,"01:22:51,981","01:22:56,897","My husband was away on business,
so I had to deal with it all."
1232,"01:22:57,654","01:23:01,864","Since then we've always
gone out for his birthday."
1233,"01:23:02,158","01:23:04,696","Last year my mother's house,
this year, camping."
1234,"01:23:05,120","01:23:09,956","Da-song's dad says it's just
a part of growing up."
1235,"01:23:10,166","01:23:14,706","They say a ghost
in the house brings wealth."
1236,"01:23:16,089","01:23:20,709","Actually, the money's been
good recently."
1237,"01:23:47,704","01:23:49,286",Thank god.
1238,"01:24:15,940","01:24:18,808",Just stay here for now.
1239,"01:24:29,662","01:24:31,528","Zoonie, what's wrong?"
1240,"01:24:34,167","01:24:35,703",Something under there?
1241,"01:24:36,961","01:24:38,418",What is it?
1242,"01:24:39,631","01:24:40,963",Damn it!
1243,"01:24:42,342","01:24:43,503","- Mom!
- Yeah?"
1244,"01:24:43,593","01:24:45,960","- How could you?
- What?"
1245,"01:24:46,054","01:24:50,139","I like ram-don too!
How could you not even ask me?"
1246,"01:24:50,475","01:24:51,351",Well...
1247,"01:24:51,352","01:24:55,140","Da-song didn't want it, so you asked Dad,
then ate it yourself."
1248,"01:24:55,230","01:24:56,230",Want her to make one?
1249,"01:24:56,272","01:24:58,138",That's not the point!
1250,"01:24:58,233","01:25:01,567","- Stop fighting over ramen!
- Why didn't you ask me?"
1251,"01:25:02,028","01:25:04,645","Oh, stop it! Just go to bed.
Go get changed."
1252,"01:25:09,035","01:25:10,401",This way!
1253,"01:25:12,539","01:25:13,539",And Ki-jung?
1254,"01:25:13,623","01:25:15,990",Under there! Hurry!
1255,"01:25:18,336","01:25:21,920","One, two, three! One, two three!"
1256,"01:25:22,006","01:25:23,292",Da-song?
1257,"01:25:24,300","01:25:25,836","Da-song, cut it out!"
1258,"01:25:26,344","01:25:29,087","He's gone crazy!
Get an umbrella."
1259,"01:25:29,389","01:25:30,925",Hey Park Da-song!
1260,"01:25:32,433","01:25:36,643","What a monster.
What the hell is he doing?"
1261,"01:25:37,355","01:25:41,099","Da-song, it's time for bed!
You know how late it is?"
1262,"01:25:41,192","01:25:42,353",Here.
1263,"01:25:43,194","01:25:44,651","Honey, here."
1264,"01:25:49,617","01:25:54,658","Who do you take after to be so stubborn!
Look at this rain!"
1265,"01:26:00,086","01:26:02,794","OMG Kevin. Da-song camping
in the yard."
1266,"01:26:06,759","01:26:11,049","Hey, channel 3 for emergencies!
Keep it turned on."
1267,"01:26:11,681","01:26:14,424","Let me have it.
I can't believe him."
1268,"01:26:15,018","01:26:17,601","Just leave him.
He'll come in if he's tired."
1269,"01:26:17,812","01:26:20,600","- I want you here, honey.
- I'm with you."
1270,"01:26:20,690","01:26:21,931","Hey, Da-hye!"
1271,"01:26:22,025","01:26:24,483","Stop using your phone.
Go to bed."
1272,"01:26:24,902","01:26:27,440","Go sleep in your room.
We'll take care of things."
1273,"01:26:27,572","01:26:30,861","This is the living room,
do you copy?"
1274,"01:26:30,950","01:26:32,031","Copy, over."
1275,"01:26:32,118","01:26:36,078","Daddy is standing by
for emergencies, over."
1276,"01:26:36,205","01:26:38,697","Got it, over."
1277,"01:26:40,043","01:26:42,080",Is that tent going to leak?
1278,"01:26:42,170","01:26:45,413","We ordered from the U.S.,
it'll be fine."
1279,"01:26:45,590","01:26:48,549","- Should we sleep here?
- What?"
1280,"01:26:48,676","01:26:50,884",We've got a full view of the tent.
1281,"01:26:51,012","01:26:52,878","Good idea.
I'll feel much better."
1282,"01:26:52,972","01:26:53,764",Right?
1283,"01:26:53,765","01:26:55,757",Let's watch over him as we sleep.
1284,"01:26:57,894","01:26:59,385",What a kid...
1285,"01:27:08,613","01:27:09,979",Wait a minute.
1286,"01:27:12,408","01:27:14,570",Where's that smell coming from?
1287,"01:27:14,661","01:27:15,947",What smell?
1288,"01:27:16,245","01:27:17,702",Mr. Kim's smell.
1289,"01:27:18,164","01:27:19,700","- Mr. Kim?
- Yeah."
1290,"01:27:20,500","01:27:21,866",Not sure what you mean.
1291,"01:27:21,959","01:27:24,918","Really?
You must have smelled it."
1292,"01:27:25,296","01:27:29,256","That smell that wafts through the car,
how to describe it?"
1293,"01:27:29,342","01:27:32,085","- An old man's smell?
- No no, it's not that."
1294,"01:27:32,178","01:27:33,885",What is it?
1295,"01:27:34,514","01:27:36,506",Like an old radish?
1296,"01:27:37,100","01:27:38,181",No.
1297,"01:27:38,476","01:27:40,718",You know when you boil a rag?
1298,"01:27:40,812","01:27:42,223",It smells like that.
1299,"01:27:44,732","01:27:51,104","Anyway, even though he always seems
about to cross the line,"
1300,"01:27:51,197","01:27:54,281","he never does cross it.
That's good."
1301,"01:27:54,492","01:27:56,199","- I'll give him credit.
- Yeah."
1302,"01:27:57,328","01:27:59,615",But that smell crosses the line.
1303,"01:28:00,206","01:28:02,493","It powers through right
into the back seat."
1304,"01:28:02,875","01:28:04,616",How bad can it be?
1305,"01:28:04,711","01:28:05,952",I don't know.
1306,"01:28:06,671","01:28:09,163",It's hard to describe.
1307,"01:28:10,174","01:28:13,793","But you sometimes smell it
on the subway."
1308,"01:28:13,928","01:28:17,171","It's been ages
since I rode a subway."
1309,"01:28:17,890","01:28:20,849","People who ride the subway
have a special smell."
1310,"01:28:20,935","01:28:22,142",Yeah.
1311,"01:28:38,494","01:28:41,077",Isn't this like the car's back seat?
1312,"01:28:41,664","01:28:45,453",What if Da-song comes back in?
1313,"01:28:46,085","01:28:47,576",Don't worry!
1314,"01:28:48,171","01:28:50,834",I can just pull my hand back.
1315,"01:28:56,471","01:28:57,962",We shouldn't...
1316,"01:29:04,061","01:29:05,723",Do it clockwise.
1317,"01:29:06,439","01:29:07,600",Right.
1318,"01:29:10,985","01:29:13,773",You know where.
1319,"01:29:30,671","01:29:34,335",You still have those cheap panties?
1320,"01:29:34,759","01:29:35,795",Huh?
1321,"01:29:35,927","01:29:38,715",The ones Yoon's girlfriend left behind.
1322,"01:29:39,847","01:29:42,840","If you wear those,
I'll get really fucking hard."
1323,"01:29:43,601","01:29:44,933",Really?
1324,"01:29:45,394","01:29:47,932",Then buy me drugs.
1325,"01:29:48,981","01:29:51,724",Buy me drugs!
1326,"01:29:53,611","01:29:55,193",Eat this instead.
1327,"01:30:07,041","01:30:08,577",You like it?
1328,"01:30:29,230","01:30:31,347","They're passed out cold.
Sneak out now."
1329,"01:31:05,516","01:31:07,974","Emergency! Emergency, over!"
1330,"01:31:10,271","01:31:11,853","- Emergency!
- What?"
1331,"01:31:12,773","01:31:14,014","What is it, over!"
1332,"01:31:14,233","01:31:15,394","Da-song, what's wrong?"
1333,"01:31:15,943","01:31:18,026","I can't sleep, over."
1334,"01:31:18,446","01:31:22,156","So stop it and come in, okay?"
1335,"01:31:22,491","01:31:25,029","Go sleep in your soft bed, over."
1336,"01:31:25,202","01:31:26,488",Right!
1337,"01:31:26,704","01:31:28,787","I don't want to, over."
1338,"01:31:29,290","01:31:30,747","Hey, Park Da-song."
1339,"01:31:35,713","01:31:37,545",Let's just sleep...
1340,"01:33:13,102","01:33:16,641",How did it turn out back there?
1341,"01:33:17,606","01:33:18,847",What?
1342,"01:33:21,027","01:33:23,144",The people in the basement.
1343,"01:33:26,032","01:33:30,197","Well, I tied them up."
1344,"01:33:30,536","01:33:32,493",What will we do now?
1345,"01:33:33,956","01:33:35,197",Huh?
1346,"01:33:37,334","01:33:40,498","What do we do now,
what's our plan?"
1347,"01:33:41,505","01:33:44,339",I've been wondering...
1348,"01:33:45,217","01:33:48,381","What would Min do
in this situation?"
1349,"01:33:50,097","01:33:52,885","Min wouldn't be
in this situation!"
1350,"01:33:54,435","01:34:00,102","Look kids, we made it
out of there safely, right?"
1351,"01:34:01,400","01:34:06,486","And besides us, nobody knows
what happened there. Right?"
1352,"01:34:06,906","01:34:09,364","So nothing happened.
You understand?"
1353,"01:34:10,785","01:34:15,155",I've got my own plan.
1354,"01:34:15,748","01:34:18,616","So you two just forget
about it, okay?"
1355,"01:34:19,960","01:34:21,952",Let's go home.
1356,"01:34:22,546","01:34:24,503",Let's go take a bath.
1357,"01:34:43,442","01:34:45,809","What are you doing there?
Hurry up!"
1358,"01:35:00,251","01:35:01,992",What's going on?
1359,"01:35:03,796","01:35:06,504","You stay there.
This is all sewage water."
1360,"01:35:06,674","01:35:09,508",Was our window open?
1361,"01:35:13,556","01:35:16,640","Help me out, Ki-taek!"
1362,"01:35:24,859","01:35:26,225",Ki-woo!
1363,"01:35:28,529","01:35:31,317","Hey Ki-woo, close the window!"
1364,"01:35:33,284","01:35:34,570",You got shocked?
1365,"01:35:41,458","01:35:42,949",I'm dizzy.
1366,"01:35:46,839","01:35:50,503","Hold on a sec.
Wait."
1367,"01:35:56,307","01:35:58,014","Shit, I'm dizzy."
1368,"01:36:02,229","01:36:04,516","Ki-jung, be careful."
1369,"01:36:06,233","01:36:08,020",Don't touch anything.
1370,"01:36:20,080","01:36:25,826","Honey, I've got a concussion."
1371,"01:36:26,128","01:36:28,620",I can't see you.
1372,"01:36:50,069","01:36:54,484","Honey, that woman Chung-sook..."
1373,"01:36:55,366","01:36:57,278","Oh, god."
1374,"01:36:57,451","01:36:59,443",What a nice person.
1375,"01:37:01,288","01:37:04,281",She kicked me down the stairs.
1376,"01:37:06,877","01:37:08,869",Repeat after me.
1377,"01:37:09,672","01:37:11,834",Chung-sook...
1378,"01:37:13,801","01:37:16,714",Chung-sook...
1379,"01:37:26,397","01:37:28,263","Hey, Ki-woo!"
1380,"01:37:29,566","01:37:31,102",What are you doing there?
1381,"01:37:31,193","01:37:32,434",Huh?
1382,"01:37:47,167","01:37:51,036",h o l p... M...
1383,"01:38:56,695","01:38:57,856",Dad.
1384,"01:38:58,489","01:38:59,650",Yeah?
1385,"01:39:00,741","01:39:04,234",What was your plan?
1386,"01:39:06,163","01:39:07,950",What are you talking about?
1387,"01:39:09,083","01:39:11,666","Before, you said you had a plan."
1388,"01:39:12,044","01:39:14,206","What will you do?
About..."
1389,"01:39:15,005","01:39:16,291",the basement.
1390,"01:39:17,007","01:39:22,753","Ki-woo, you know
what kind of plan never fails?"
1391,"01:39:24,640","01:39:26,882",No plan at all.
1392,"01:39:27,226","01:39:28,683",No plan.
1393,"01:39:29,436","01:39:30,893",You know why?
1394,"01:39:32,731","01:39:39,103","If you make a plan,
life never works out that way."
1395,"01:39:40,072","01:39:41,654",Look around us.
1396,"01:39:42,074","01:39:47,490","Did these people think,
""Let's all spend the night in a gym?"""
1397,"01:39:48,414","01:39:50,030",But look now.
1398,"01:39:50,499","01:39:54,118","Everyone's sleeping on the floor,
us included."
1399,"01:39:56,046","01:39:59,084",That's why people shouldn't make plans.
1400,"01:40:01,260","01:40:05,095","With no plan,
nothing can go wrong."
1401,"01:40:05,389","01:40:11,886","And if something spins out of control,
it doesn't matter."
1402,"01:40:13,147","01:40:15,890","Whether you kill someone,
or betray your country."
1403,"01:40:17,526","01:40:21,110","None of it fucking matters.
Got it?"
1404,"01:40:23,157","01:40:24,489",Dad.
1405,"01:40:26,577","01:40:27,943",I'm sorry.
1406,"01:40:28,787","01:40:30,244",For what?
1407,"01:40:33,584","01:40:34,950",Everything.
1408,"01:40:36,003","01:40:37,414",All of it.
1409,"01:40:39,756","01:40:41,463",I'll take care of everything.
1410,"01:40:42,676","01:40:44,508",What are you talking about?
1411,"01:40:46,847","01:40:49,214",Why are you hugging that stone?
1412,"01:40:50,184","01:40:51,516",This?
1413,"01:40:57,274","01:41:00,108",It keeps clinging to me.
1414,"01:41:04,781","01:41:06,773",I think you need some sleep.
1415,"01:41:09,661","01:41:11,118",I'm serious.
1416,"01:41:13,040","01:41:15,123",It keeps following me.
1417,"01:41:27,804","01:41:30,512","Miss Jessica! Sorry to call
on Sunday morning."
1418,"01:41:30,724","01:41:33,011",Are you free for lunch today?
1419,"01:41:33,101","01:41:36,936","We're having a birthday impromptu
for Da-song."
1420,"01:41:38,482","01:41:40,223",A birthday party?
1421,"01:41:40,317","01:41:43,526","If you come too,
Da-song will be so happy."
1422,"01:41:43,987","01:41:47,697","And have as much pasta, gratin,
and salmon steak as you want."
1423,"01:41:48,158","01:41:50,241","Please come by 1PM,"
1424,"01:41:50,327","01:41:53,286","and I'll count today
as one of your lessons."
1425,"01:41:53,372","01:41:56,035","You know what I mean?
See you soon!"
1426,"01:41:57,376","01:41:58,833","- Mom.
- Yeah?"
1427,"01:41:58,919","01:42:02,538","For the impromptu,
should we invite Kevin too?"
1428,"01:42:02,631","01:42:05,339","Great idea! Why not?
Will you call him?"
1429,"01:42:05,551","01:42:09,340","Get some more sleep, honey!
You must be tired after yesterday."
1430,"01:42:09,555","01:42:13,549","If we have a party,
won't you need to do the rounds?"
1431,"01:42:13,725","01:42:17,890","Right, the wine shop,
supermarket, bakery, florist..."
1432,"01:42:18,105","01:42:21,473","But I already told Mr. Kim
to hurry over."
1433,"01:42:21,817","01:42:23,228",I'll pay him overtime.
1434,"01:42:23,318","01:42:24,318",Perfect
1435,"01:42:34,746","01:42:38,911","Everyone sit down,
I'll explain!"
1436,"01:42:39,001","01:42:42,165","Da-hye: We're having a party,"
1437,"01:42:42,170","01:42:44,412",and mom said to invite you!
1438,"01:42:46,717","01:42:49,710","Sis, in the basement..."
1439,"01:42:50,095","01:42:52,428",we have 10 outdoor tables.
1440,"01:42:52,514","01:42:56,349","First take them all out,
then arrange them..."
1441,"01:42:57,019","01:43:00,103","No, come to the window.
I need to show you."
1442,"01:43:01,940","01:43:03,772","With Da-song's tent
in the middle,"
1443,"01:43:03,900","01:43:07,268",curve the tables outward...
1444,"01:43:07,696","01:43:09,437",A crane's wing formation!
1445,"01:43:09,823","01:43:12,941","Like Admiral Yi used, you know?
The Battle of Hansan Island!"
1446,"01:43:13,368","01:43:15,701","Think of the tent
as the Japanese warship."
1447,"01:43:15,787","01:43:21,078","And our tables will make
a semicircular crane's wing formation."
1448,"01:43:21,168","01:43:25,333","Then near the tent will be
the barbeque grill, firewood and such."
1449,"01:43:25,422","01:43:27,414",Arrange them all there!
1450,"01:43:28,008","01:43:31,376","Oh sure, bring your husband too!"
1451,"01:43:31,470","01:43:32,470",Yeah.
1452,"01:43:32,554","01:43:36,138","And definitely no presents,
just come!"
1453,"01:43:36,224","01:43:37,016",Yeah.
1454,"01:43:37,017","01:43:39,054",What dress code?
1455,"01:43:39,144","01:43:42,478","It's an impromptu.
You can wear sweat pants!"
1456,"01:43:43,649","01:43:49,520","And definitely no presents!
Just come and eat hors d'oeuvres!"
1457,"01:43:50,614","01:43:52,571",You know my culinary skills!
1458,"01:43:52,824","01:43:57,535","Right! We'll get drunk
in the daytime."
1459,"01:43:57,996","01:43:58,996",Yeah.
1460,"01:43:59,081","01:44:02,916","If you'd sing, that'd be grand!
You know the one..."
1461,"01:44:18,725","01:44:21,593","Quiet, he's sleeping!"
1462,"01:44:22,020","01:44:25,229","Today the sky's so blue,
and no pollution!"
1463,"01:44:25,565","01:44:27,602",Thanks to all the rain yesterday.
1464,"01:44:28,777","01:44:29,893",Right.
1465,"01:44:30,112","01:44:33,901","So we traded camping
for a garden party."
1466,"01:44:35,200","01:44:36,611",Lemons into lemonade.
1467,"01:44:39,996","01:44:44,787","Right, that rain was such
a blessing!"
1468,"01:44:46,378","01:44:50,839","And definitely no presents,
I mean it!"
1469,"01:44:51,591","01:44:55,210","Right, just squeeze
your Mini Cooper into the garage."
1470,"01:44:55,303","01:44:56,885",Go on up!
1471,"01:44:57,013","01:45:02,133","Right, back it in.
Just don't block the Benz!"
1472,"01:45:02,227","01:45:06,471","You're here!
It's been so long!"
1473,"01:45:07,566","01:45:10,058",I told you no presents!
1474,"01:45:28,462","01:45:30,294",You were thinking of something else.
1475,"01:45:30,797","01:45:32,038",What?
1476,"01:45:33,008","01:45:36,467","While kissing me,
you thought of something else."
1477,"01:45:38,513","01:45:39,629",No.
1478,"01:45:40,515","01:45:44,008","What do you mean?
You're doing it now, too."
1479,"01:45:46,730","01:45:47,971",Wow.
1480,"01:45:49,858","01:45:52,145","Everyone looks gorgeous, right?"
1481,"01:45:53,737","01:45:57,401","Even for a sudden gathering,
they're so cool."
1482,"01:45:58,742","01:46:00,574",And look so natural.
1483,"01:46:02,662","01:46:03,994",Da-hye.
1484,"01:46:06,750","01:46:08,207",Do I fit in here?
1485,"01:46:09,961","01:46:11,202",What?
1486,"01:46:12,172","01:46:15,006","In this setting, do I fit in?"
1487,"01:46:25,352","01:46:27,344","Hey, where are you going?"
1488,"01:46:27,854","01:46:29,220",I need to go down.
1489,"01:46:29,481","01:46:31,723",Just stay with me.
1490,"01:46:32,859","01:46:34,566",I need to go down there.
1491,"01:46:35,320","01:46:39,815","Why go to those boring people?
Can't you stay here?"
1492,"01:46:40,784","01:46:45,119","Not to those people, down lower."
1493,"01:46:45,664","01:46:48,156","Wow, what is that?"
1494,"01:46:51,419","01:46:55,038","God, I can't believe
I'm doing this at my age."
1495,"01:46:55,757","01:46:57,623",It's so embarrassing.
1496,"01:46:58,677","01:47:00,384","I'm really sorry, Mr. Kim."
1497,"01:47:00,554","01:47:03,638","Da-song's mom insisted,
it can't be helped."
1498,"01:47:03,849","01:47:05,511",But the concept is simple.
1499,"01:47:05,600","01:47:10,846","There'll be a parade with Jessica
carrying a birthday cake."
1500,"01:47:10,939","01:47:14,899",Then we jump out and attack Jessica.
1501,"01:47:14,985","01:47:17,022",Swinging our tomahawks!
1502,"01:47:17,279","01:47:18,237",Right.
1503,"01:47:18,238","01:47:23,199","Just then, Da-song the good Indian
will jump out and we'll do battle."
1504,"01:47:23,910","01:47:28,200","Finally he'll save Jessica the cake princess,
and they'll all cheer."
1505,"01:47:28,456","01:47:30,072",Something like that.
1506,"01:47:31,251","01:47:32,251","Silly, isn't it?"
1507,"01:47:32,294","01:47:37,085","I guess your wife likes events
and surprises."
1508,"01:47:37,215","01:47:38,877","Yeah, she does."
1509,"01:47:39,301","01:47:42,009","But she's particularly
into this party."
1510,"01:47:43,680","01:47:46,548","You're trying your best, too."
1511,"01:47:47,851","01:47:50,559","Well, you love her, after all."
1512,"01:47:56,151","01:47:57,483",Mr. Kim.
1513,"01:47:59,195","01:48:01,482",You're getting paid extra.
1514,"01:48:06,953","01:48:10,947","Think of this as part of your work,
okay?"
1515,"01:48:22,636","01:48:24,127",Did you go down below?
1516,"01:48:24,304","01:48:28,093","- Not yet.
- Shouldn't we talk to them?"
1517,"01:48:28,183","01:48:29,890",Reach an understanding?
1518,"01:48:30,018","01:48:31,099",Exactly!
1519,"01:48:31,186","01:48:33,769","We all got too fucking worked up
last night."
1520,"01:48:33,855","01:48:37,599",Dad was going on about some plan...
1521,"01:48:38,276","01:48:40,768","- I'm just going down there.
- Hold on."
1522,"01:48:40,862","01:48:43,104",Take this down to them.
1523,"01:48:43,198","01:48:44,814","- They must be hungry.
- Right."
1524,"01:48:44,908","01:48:46,490",Let them eat first.
1525,"01:48:47,619","01:48:49,485",Come next time for sure!
1526,"01:48:51,081","01:48:53,118","Here you are, Jessica."
1527,"01:48:53,249","01:48:55,491","- This is so amazing.
- Isn't it great?"
1528,"01:48:55,669","01:48:58,082",I've got a special favor to ask.
1529,"01:48:58,213","01:48:59,329",What is it?
1530,"01:48:59,464","01:49:01,751",This is... how to describe it?
1531,"01:49:01,841","01:49:03,798",Da-song's trauma recovery cake?
1532,"01:49:03,885","01:49:07,003","So it needs to be you who does it.
Today's highlight!"
1533,"01:50:30,055","01:50:33,264","Hey, are you okay?"
1534,"01:50:38,646","01:50:39,978",Are you...?
1535,"01:50:49,908","01:50:51,399","Wait, mister!"
1536,"01:52:38,349","01:52:41,057",Kevin? Kevin!
1537,"01:52:47,942","01:52:50,776","Da-song, happy birthday!"
1538,"01:52:50,862","01:52:52,148",Congratulations!
1539,"01:52:59,579","01:53:00,740",Shit...
1540,"01:53:10,798","01:53:12,255",Stop!
1541,"01:53:12,800","01:53:14,883",Chung-sook!
1542,"01:53:14,969","01:53:15,928",Ki-jung!
1543,"01:53:15,929","01:53:17,215","Come out here, Chung-sook!"
1544,"01:53:17,305","01:53:20,844","Stop the blood! Push down
on the wound!"
1545,"01:53:25,688","01:53:26,804",Da-song!
1546,"01:53:27,523","01:53:28,604",Honey!
1547,"01:53:30,193","01:53:32,025","Let go, don't!"
1548,"01:53:42,830","01:53:44,196",It hurts.
1549,"01:53:49,420","01:53:50,456",The emergency room!
1550,"01:53:50,546","01:53:51,787",Get the car!
1551,"01:53:51,881","01:53:53,793","Mr. Kim!
What are you doing?"
1552,"01:53:53,967","01:53:55,959",We can't wait for an ambulance!
1553,"01:53:56,052","01:53:58,339","Stop pushing, Dad!"
1554,"01:53:58,513","01:54:01,347",Makes it hurt more.
1555,"01:54:02,100","01:54:03,307","Car keys!
The car keys!"
1556,"01:54:03,393","01:54:05,885","Throw them!
Throw me the keys!"
1557,"01:54:23,788","01:54:25,120",Are you okay?
1558,"01:54:25,665","01:54:27,122",Don't touch it!
1559,"01:54:29,627","01:54:31,914","Hello, Mr. Park."
1560,"01:54:32,130","01:54:33,291",You know me?
1561,"01:54:33,381","01:54:34,713",Respect!
1562,"01:56:01,677","01:56:05,045","Opening my eyes for the first time
in a month,"
1563,"01:56:05,139","01:56:06,721",I saw a detective.
1564,"01:56:07,016","01:56:11,807","You have the right to
an attorney..."
1565,"01:56:11,896","01:56:14,013","Who looked nothing like
a detective."
1566,"01:56:18,486","01:56:20,148",Is he laughing?
1567,"01:56:20,571","01:56:22,028",Just a sec.
1568,"01:56:22,615","01:56:27,076","Then the doctor who looked
nothing like a doctor spoke."
1569,"01:56:28,454","01:56:32,164","That happens sometimes
after brain surgery."
1570,"01:56:32,375","01:56:34,241","They keep laughing.
For no reason."
1571,"01:56:35,169","01:56:37,252",Do you hear me?
1572,"01:56:37,672","01:56:39,379",Can you hear me?
1573,"01:56:39,674","01:56:41,415",Then do I have to do it again?
1574,"01:56:41,551","01:56:42,467",Do what?
1575,"01:56:42,468","01:56:44,004",The Miranda thing.
1576,"01:56:46,264","01:56:50,599",You have the right to remain silent.
1577,"01:56:50,685","01:56:53,302","Anything you say can and
will be used against you..."
1578,"01:56:53,396","01:56:55,308","He keeps laughing, look!"
1579,"01:56:58,693","01:57:04,530","Even when I heard
how much Ki-jung bled that day..."
1580,"01:57:06,951","01:57:13,951","Even when I heard the words forgery,
trespassing, foul play, self-defense"
1581,"01:57:14,459","01:57:18,578","and we were lucky
to get away with a probation..."
1582,"01:57:21,799","01:57:24,963","Even when I finally
got to see Ki-jung's face..."
1583,"01:57:25,052","01:57:27,669","Kim Ki-jung, RIP"
1584,"01:57:29,390","01:57:31,507",I kept laughing.
1585,"01:57:41,486","01:57:46,732","Still, when I went back
and watched the news reports,"
1586,"01:57:47,074","01:57:48,485",I didn't laugh.
1587,"01:57:48,534","01:57:52,403","This sudden rampage in the back yard
of an upper-class home"
1588,"01:57:52,497","01:57:54,113",is a highly unusual case.
1589,"01:57:54,207","01:57:58,702","Since the homeless man who sparked
the rampage died at the scene,"
1590,"01:57:58,794","01:58:04,040","police are struggling to
even establish a clear motive."
1591,"01:58:04,133","01:58:08,628","The driver Kim and the slain Mr. Park
are said to have been on good terms."
1592,"01:58:08,763","01:58:14,100","For now the police investigation is
focused on locating the driver Kim."
1593,"01:58:14,644","01:58:18,433","Kim, after exiting this door
and descending the stairs,"
1594,"01:58:18,731","01:58:21,849",disappeared into the neighboring alleys.
1595,"01:58:22,652","01:58:27,647","Police searched the CCTVs
of nearby homes to no avail,"
1596,"01:58:28,115","01:58:31,279","and they have yet
to find any witnesses."
1597,"01:58:31,827","01:58:33,944","Given the situation,"
1598,"01:58:34,163","01:58:39,079","it's not an exaggeration to say that
Kim vanished into thin air."
1599,"01:58:40,545","01:58:47,509","Actually Mom and I had no idea
where Dad was."
1600,"01:58:49,845","01:58:55,216","But those detectives
still wore themselves out tailing us."
1601,"01:58:59,355","01:59:03,065","Eventually the news went quiet,"
1602,"01:59:03,067","01:59:05,184","and after the tails stopped,"
1603,"01:59:05,987","01:59:09,151",I started going up that mountain.
1604,"01:59:11,409","01:59:15,870","From up there,
you get a great view of the house."
1605,"01:59:18,916","01:59:22,626","That day, despite the cold,"
1606,"01:59:23,504","01:59:26,042",I felt like staying longer.
1607,"01:59:39,145","01:59:42,183",Dash-dash-dot-dot
1608,"02:00:07,965","02:00:09,251",Son!
1609,"02:00:11,344","02:00:12,585",Son!
1610,"02:00:14,847","02:00:18,261","Perhaps you, if no one else,
will be able to read this letter."
1611,"02:00:21,937","02:00:24,520","You were a Boy Scout,"
1612,"02:00:24,523","02:00:27,982","so I'm writing this just
in case."
1613,"02:00:31,530","02:00:34,113",Have your injuries healed?
1614,"02:00:35,368","02:00:39,453","I'm sure your mom is
plenty healthy."
1615,"02:00:43,584","02:00:46,247",I'm doing fine in here.
1616,"02:00:47,463","02:00:50,046","Though thinking of
Ki-jung makes me cry."
1617,"02:00:53,511","02:00:57,881","Even now, what happened that day
doesn't seem real."
1618,"02:00:59,392","02:01:01,429","It feels like a dream,"
1619,"02:01:02,728","02:01:04,310",and yet it doesn't.
1620,"02:01:05,815","02:01:10,150","That day as I went out the gate,
I suddenly knew."
1621,"02:01:11,529","02:01:13,316",Where I needed to go...
1622,"02:01:52,945","02:01:55,938","A house where such
a grisly crime took place"
1623,"02:01:56,073","02:01:58,861","would surely not be easy
to sell."
1624,"02:02:02,413","02:02:04,780","I'm sorry, Mr. Park."
1625,"02:02:04,957","02:02:11,045","I struggled to hold out like that
in an empty house."
1626,"02:02:13,966","02:02:16,879","Still, thanks to the house
being empty,"
1627,"02:02:17,052","02:02:21,843","what was her name?
Moon-gwang?"
1628,"02:02:22,057","02:02:25,846","I was able to give her
a proper send off."
1629,"02:02:27,438","02:02:33,651","I hear tree-side burials are trendy,
so hell, I did my best."
1630,"02:02:37,406","02:02:40,945","But those real estate
sharks sure are clever."
1631,"02:02:45,581","02:02:50,042","They hoodwinked some people
who hadjust arrived in Korea"
1632,"02:02:50,127","02:02:52,335",and managed to sell the house.
1633,"02:02:53,547","02:02:56,790","With the parents working,
and the kids attending school,"
1634,"02:02:56,884","02:02:59,171",the family is usually out.
1635,"02:02:59,637","02:03:04,757","But the goddamned housekeeper
stays there 24 hours a day."
1636,"02:03:05,226","02:03:09,846","Each time I go upstairs,
I take my life in my hands."
1637,"02:03:12,650","02:03:16,735","It turns out Germans eat
more than just sausage and beer."
1638,"02:03:17,404","02:03:19,270",What a relief.
1639,"02:03:22,159","02:03:25,994","Passing the time down here,
everything starts to go hazy."
1640,"02:03:30,793","02:03:34,912","Today at least I was able
to write you a letter."
1641,"02:03:36,799","02:03:40,793","If I send out the letter
this way every night,"
1642,"02:03:40,886","02:03:44,926",maybe someday you'll see it.
1643,"02:03:51,105","02:03:52,767",So long.
1644,"02:04:06,829","02:04:08,070","You're home, Ki-woo?"
1645,"02:04:08,163","02:04:09,163",Yeah.
1646,"02:04:23,429","02:04:28,094","Dad, today I made a plan."
1647,"02:04:29,810","02:04:31,722",A fundamental plan.
1648,"02:04:34,815","02:04:36,647",I'm going to earn money.
1649,"02:04:37,401","02:04:39,017",A lot of it.
1650,"02:04:42,406","02:04:46,821","University, a career, marriage,
those are all fine,"
1651,"02:04:47,328","02:04:49,285",but first I'll earn money.
1652,"02:04:49,413","02:04:54,454","You'll see once you go in,
but it's very spacious."
1653,"02:04:55,377","02:04:59,872","Actually, we don't show this house
to just anyone."
1654,"02:05:00,257","02:05:04,297","When I have money,
I'll buy that house."
1655,"02:05:05,554","02:05:09,764","On the day we move in,
Mom and I will be in the yard."
1656,"02:05:10,392","02:05:12,725","Because the sunshine is
so nice there."
1657,"02:05:14,063","02:05:15,895",All you'll need to do
1658,"02:05:16,315","02:05:18,648",is walk up the stairs.
1659,"02:06:41,859","02:06:45,478",Take care until then.
1660,"02:06:50,659","02:06:52,321",So long.
