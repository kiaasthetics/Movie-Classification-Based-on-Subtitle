189,"00:10:59,570","00:11:01,202","It's a corrupt world,
my friend."
190,"00:11:01,204","00:11:02,438",No good being the little guy.
191,"00:11:02,440","00:11:04,239",He's coming over.
192,"00:11:04,241","00:11:05,309",Mmm.
193,"00:11:07,011","00:11:08,877","- Here we go.
- Michael."
194,"00:11:08,879","00:11:10,379","- David.
- Been a while."
195,"00:11:10,381","00:11:13,081","Yeah, yeah.
Captain David. Congrats."
196,"00:11:13,083","00:11:14,916","Well, I spend
more time in City Hall"
197,"00:11:14,918","00:11:16,519",than I do on the job.
198,"00:11:16,521","00:11:19,122","- That goes with the stripes.
- Yeah. Yeah."
199,"00:11:20,425","00:11:23,161","- Still selling insurance?
- Yep."
200,"00:11:25,562","00:11:28,930","- Sorry to interrupt.
- No, no."
201,"00:11:28,932","00:11:30,231","Lieutenant, a word?"
202,"00:11:30,233","00:11:33,435","Aw, Cap, I just pulled a 12-hour
back to back. Can it wait?"
203,"00:11:33,437","00:11:35,135",Sure.
204,"00:11:35,137","00:11:36,237","Anyway, good to see you, Mike."
205,"00:11:36,239","00:11:38,106","Yeah, you, too, David."
206,"00:11:38,108","00:11:41,076","- Be careful with this one.
- Yeah, I will."
207,"00:11:42,379","00:11:44,579","- Ah... You prick.
- Shh."
208,"00:11:48,953","00:11:52,187","Listen, the Michael I know,"
209,"00:11:52,189","00:11:53,555","he doesn't hide things
from his wife,"
210,"00:11:53,557","00:11:55,625","and he isn't too proud
to ask a friend for help."
211,"00:11:55,627","00:11:57,259",I'll be fine. I'll be fine.
212,"00:11:57,261","00:11:59,159","That's your
Irish pride talking."
213,"00:11:59,161","00:12:01,429","- You should know.
- I gotta go pick up my kid."
214,"00:12:01,431","00:12:02,564",Mmm.
215,"00:12:02,566","00:12:04,900","Don't you have
a train to catch?"
216,"00:12:04,902","00:12:07,602","- Yes. Jim, what's the damage?
- No, no, no, I got it."
217,"00:12:07,604","00:12:09,538","Promise me that when you get
home, you'll tell Karen."
218,"00:12:09,540","00:12:11,406","What, that you finally
paid for something?"
219,"00:12:11,408","00:12:12,442",What's the old Irish saying?
220,"00:12:12,444","00:12:14,174","If you wanna know
what God thinks about money,"
221,"00:12:14,176","00:12:15,410",look at who he gives it to.
222,"00:12:15,412","00:12:16,612","Look at who
he gives it to. Yeah."
223,"00:12:16,614","00:12:18,550","I'll catch you.
Jim, I'll catch you."
224,"00:12:35,565","00:12:37,298",Boarding call for the 6:25
225,"00:12:37,300","00:12:39,237","Hudson North
to Poughkeepsie. Six..."
226,"00:12:40,137","00:12:41,636",Excuse me. Thank you.
227,"00:12:41,638","00:12:43,642","Sir, can I see
your bag, please?"
228,"00:12:45,410","00:12:47,241","Ma'am, this way, please."
229,"00:12:47,243","00:12:48,611","Can you believe this?
They're doing bag checks"
230,"00:12:48,613","00:12:50,312",at goddamn rush hour.
231,"00:12:50,314","00:12:52,017","Step forward, ma'am. Sir."
232,"00:12:54,284","00:12:56,352","If something's ticking,
let it through."
233,"00:12:56,354","00:12:58,119","Forward, sir. Open up."
234,"00:12:58,121","00:12:59,122",I can't do it.
235,"00:13:02,359","00:13:04,225","Hey, Mike, you wanna do me
a quick deal on some insurance"
236,"00:13:04,227","00:13:06,193","before I have
a friggin' heart attack here?"
237,"00:13:06,195","00:13:08,229","Sir, your bag, please."
238,"00:13:08,231","00:13:10,130",Thank you.
239,"00:13:10,132","00:13:12,470","Suspicious or
unattended package, please..."
240,"00:13:14,571","00:13:16,472","Hey,
watch where you're going."
241,"00:13:16,474","00:13:17,707","Safety
is everyone's responsibility."
242,"00:13:17,709","00:13:20,044","If you see something,
say something."
243,"00:13:26,416","00:13:27,585",I want to.
244,"00:13:30,687","00:13:32,420",Stand clear.
245,"00:13:34,993","00:13:36,662",My phone.
246,"00:13:38,429","00:13:40,131",Shit.
247,"00:13:48,605","00:13:50,573","Look, man,
I'm already on the train."
248,"00:13:50,575","00:13:52,273","If it's gonna happen at all,
it's gonna happen tonight."
249,"00:13:52,275","00:13:54,278",No more excuses.
250,"00:13:56,246","00:13:58,646","- Hey, Walt.
- You get me a name?"
251,"00:13:58,648","00:13:59,748",What?
252,"00:13:59,750","00:14:01,483","Well, that woman's
staring at you"
253,"00:14:01,485","00:14:03,487","like she knows
something we don't."
254,"00:14:05,623","00:14:07,290",I don't see anybody.
255,"00:14:09,694","00:14:11,192",Everything all right?
256,"00:14:11,194","00:14:14,095","Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Tried in the next car?"
257,"00:14:14,097","00:14:15,330","No, I've gotta take a leak."
258,"00:14:15,332","00:14:17,466","My prostate's bigger
than your head."
259,"00:14:33,417","00:14:35,351","Look, Manny, I'm telling you,"
260,"00:14:35,353","00:14:37,586","the lines are fine,
but there's no power."
261,"00:14:37,588","00:14:39,421","Have 'em fix it
when we get in, okay?"
262,"00:14:39,423","00:14:41,288","- Copy that.
- What if I try this?"
263,"00:14:42,527","00:14:46,061","- Jesus, Jimmy. Come on.
- Hey, I did nothing."
264,"00:14:46,063","00:14:49,096","Hey, Tarrytown.
AC's out in this coach."
265,"00:14:49,098","00:14:51,198","Get a seat up front
while you can."
266,"00:14:51,200","00:14:54,235","- You look worn out, Sam.
- Yeah. 32 years."
267,"00:14:54,237","00:14:56,472","If the train don't kill me,
the people will."
268,"00:14:56,474","00:14:58,774","- Tell me about it.
- Yeah."
269,"00:15:04,514","00:15:06,815","- Do it for me.
- Stop it. I don't want..."
270,"00:15:06,817","00:15:10,085","- Take the bag.
- Let... Stop it. Get off."
271,"00:15:10,087","00:15:12,457","Now, that's exactly why
I never got married."
272,"00:15:14,691","00:15:16,360",Just... God.
273,"00:15:24,101","00:15:26,602","...JP Morgan and Chase
all over it. Open your eyes."
274,"00:15:26,604","00:15:29,140","I told you to buy low,
didn't I? What?"
275,"00:15:29,806","00:15:31,873",Are you serious?
276,"00:15:31,875","00:15:33,173","I said, are you serious?"
277,"00:15:33,175","00:15:34,443","This is a Gieves
& Hawkes suit."
278,"00:15:34,445","00:15:35,711","Does that mean
anything to you?"
279,"00:15:35,713","00:15:37,211",Of course it doesn't.
280,"00:15:37,213","00:15:40,215","Yeah. If he's a piker,
get rid of him."
281,"00:15:40,217","00:15:41,583","Wipe him off the table.
Put him in the trash."
282,"00:15:41,585","00:15:42,785","Find someone
who can trade size."
283,"00:15:42,787","00:15:45,587",This gives me F.U. money.
284,"00:15:45,589","00:15:47,389",I caught big.
285,"00:15:47,391","00:15:49,224","You can't afford a suit,
you don't get in. I told him."
286,"00:15:49,226","00:15:50,458","Tickets, please.
Let me get your tickets."
287,"00:15:50,460","00:15:51,495",Thank you very much.
288,"00:15:55,132","00:15:56,866","Thank you. You got a ticket
there, young lady?"
289,"00:15:56,868","00:15:59,735","You buy a ticket on the train,
I gotta charge you a penalty."
290,"00:15:59,737","00:16:01,804","It sucks.
I know. Tell me about it."
291,"00:16:01,806","00:16:03,338",Bureaucrats.
292,"00:16:03,340","00:16:04,540","Tickets out, everybody."
293,"00:16:06,777","00:16:08,343","Thanks, Gordon.
Thank you very much."
294,"00:16:08,345","00:16:09,745",Knicks game. Knicks game.
295,"00:16:09,747","00:16:11,546","Hey, get your feet off
the seat there, sweetheart."
296,"00:16:11,548","00:16:12,747",You got a ticket?
297,"00:16:12,749","00:16:14,482",It's a goddamn shame.
298,"00:16:14,484","00:16:16,385","Shut your mouth. Of course
I know what I'm talking about."
299,"00:16:16,387","00:16:17,819","How many years have I been
doing this? Tell me."
300,"00:16:17,821","00:16:19,688",Do you mind?
301,"00:16:19,690","00:16:22,458",I mind your 99-cent perfume.
302,"00:16:22,460","00:16:24,325","- Tickets, guys.
- No, now I'm talking to you."
303,"00:16:24,327","00:16:26,193",Thank you.
304,"00:16:26,195","00:16:28,700","Come on, come on. Bye-bye."
305,"00:16:29,867","00:16:32,535",Go ahead. Send it through.
306,"00:16:32,537","00:16:34,703","I'm looking
at the numbers now."
307,"00:16:34,705","00:16:36,838","Now arriving
68th Street Station."
308,"00:16:54,458","00:16:57,492","Now leaving
68th Street Station."
309,"00:16:57,494","00:16:59,864","Next stop,
86th Street Station."
310,"00:17:18,848","00:17:20,849","Steinbeck, huh?"
311,"00:17:20,851","00:17:22,551",Some say his greatest work
312,"00:17:22,553","00:17:24,188","was a letter
he wrote to his son."
313,"00:17:25,989","00:17:28,527","- Your book.
- Right."
314,"00:17:29,727","00:17:31,729",I beg your pardon.
315,"00:17:33,864","00:17:35,566",Thank you.
316,"00:17:41,238","00:17:43,371","It's my first time
on a commuter train."
317,"00:17:43,373","00:17:45,873",It's eclectic.
318,"00:17:45,875","00:17:49,745","- What about you?
- Every day. Last 10 years."
319,"00:17:49,747","00:17:50,879",Ten years?
320,"00:17:50,881","00:17:53,415","You must know
everyone on this train."
321,"00:17:53,417","00:17:57,518","The regular commuters,
I guess. Faces mostly."
322,"00:17:57,520","00:17:59,824","- I'm sorry. Have we met?
- No. I'm Joanna."
323,"00:18:00,658","00:18:02,661","- Michael.
- Michael."
324,"00:18:05,930","00:18:08,263","How long is it between stops?
Four minutes?"
325,"00:18:08,265","00:18:10,431","Yeah, give or take."
326,"00:18:10,433","00:18:13,635","Four minutes.
On and off, on and off."
327,"00:18:13,637","00:18:15,838",It's so miscellaneous.
328,"00:18:15,840","00:18:18,974","- I'm bothering you, aren't I?
- No."
329,"00:18:18,976","00:18:20,946","I am.
You just wanna read your book."
330,"00:18:23,913","00:18:27,650",It's... I'm married.
331,"00:18:27,652","00:18:29,284","Oh, I... Me, too."
332,"00:18:30,554","00:18:32,320","- Sorry.
- I study human behavior."
333,"00:18:32,322","00:18:34,957","- It's an occupational hazard.
- Being married?"
334,"00:18:34,959","00:18:37,458","- No, bothering people.
- Oh."
335,"00:18:37,460","00:18:39,463",I'm a conversationalist.
336,"00:18:41,665","00:18:44,667","So, in your job, you sit down,"
337,"00:18:44,669","00:18:47,569","strike up a conversation.
Then what?"
338,"00:18:47,571","00:18:51,006","Okay, let's say there are
100 people in this car."
339,"00:18:51,008","00:18:53,409","There are
16 personality types,"
340,"00:18:53,411","00:18:55,009",as defined by psychology.
341,"00:18:55,011","00:18:57,345","And so I can assume
that there are about"
342,"00:18:57,347","00:18:58,881","six people of each type,"
343,"00:18:58,883","00:19:00,548","with varying
degrees of response"
344,"00:19:00,550","00:19:02,717",to any particular situation.
345,"00:19:02,719","00:19:06,621","My job is to answer
one basic question."
346,"00:19:06,623","00:19:09,992","- What's that?
- What kind of person are you?"
347,"00:19:09,994","00:19:12,995","Me? You should
probably ask my wife."
348,"00:19:16,467","00:19:18,867","- Let's do an experiment.
- Experiment?"
349,"00:19:18,869","00:19:19,868",It's painless.
350,"00:19:19,870","00:19:21,471","It's just a simple
hypothetical question."
351,"00:19:22,707","00:19:24,476",Okay.
352,"00:19:28,645","00:19:33,350","What if I asked you
to do one little thing?"
353,"00:19:35,619","00:19:39,688","It's something that you are
uniquely qualified to do."
354,"00:19:39,690","00:19:42,524","It's something
that's meaningless to you,"
355,"00:19:42,526","00:19:45,997","but it could profoundly affect
an individual on this train."
356,"00:19:47,364","00:19:48,496",Would you do it?
357,"00:19:48,498","00:19:50,998","I'd want to know
what kind of thing."
358,"00:19:51,000","00:19:53,535","- Mmm-hmm. Does it matter?
- Well, I think it does."
359,"00:19:53,537","00:19:54,635",And you would never know
360,"00:19:54,637","00:19:55,903","the consequences
of what you did."
361,"00:19:55,905","00:19:57,775",Then why would I do it?
362,"00:20:00,678","00:20:02,647","Because there
would be a reward."
363,"00:20:03,780","00:20:04,848",A-ha.
364,"00:20:06,816","00:20:10,387","So, uh... What's the reward?"
365,"00:20:16,660","00:20:19,092","In the bathroom, carriage two,"
366,"00:20:19,094","00:20:23,832","maybe there is a package.
It's hidden,"
367,"00:20:23,834","00:20:29,772","and inside that package
is $25,000."
368,"00:20:29,774","00:20:33,545","That money is yours,
plus another 75 cash,"
369,"00:20:34,912","00:20:37,081","if you do
this one little thing."
370,"00:20:38,516","00:20:39,950",I don't understand.
371,"00:20:41,585","00:20:44,419","Someone on this train
does not belong."
372,"00:20:44,421","00:20:47,959","All you have to do
is find them. That's it."
373,"00:20:49,427","00:20:51,459",This person is carrying a bag.
374,"00:20:51,461","00:20:52,794","You don't know
what it looks like."
375,"00:20:52,796","00:20:55,467","But inside that bag
is something they have stolen."
376,"00:20:58,066","00:21:00,468","This person goes
by the name of Prynne."
377,"00:21:00,470","00:21:02,571",It's not a real name.
378,"00:21:02,573","00:21:05,477","They will be on this train
until Cold Spring."
379,"00:21:08,111","00:21:10,746","You find them,
you find the bag,"
380,"00:21:10,748","00:21:12,450","that $100,000 is yours."
381,"00:21:15,553","00:21:17,986","Don't leave the train
before finding the bag."
382,"00:21:17,988","00:21:19,487","Don't tell anyone
about this offer."
383,"00:21:19,489","00:21:20,621",Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
384,"00:21:20,623","00:21:21,723",Simple.
385,"00:21:21,725","00:21:23,495","I thought
this was hypothetical."
386,"00:21:24,594","00:21:25,893",It's just one little thing.
387,"00:21:25,895","00:21:28,129","It shouldn't be too hard
for an ex-cop."
388,"00:21:28,131","00:21:29,631","- Wait.
- Arriving at..."
389,"00:21:29,633","00:21:30,865","- How did you know...
- ...86th Street Station."
390,"00:21:30,867","00:21:33,604","- Oh, that's me.
- You're being serious, right?"
391,"00:21:35,170","00:21:37,538","You have until
the next stop to decide."
392,"00:21:37,540","00:21:39,510",What kind of person are you?
393,"00:21:53,122","00:21:54,590","Now leaving
86th Street Station."
394,"00:21:54,592","00:21:55,593",What?
395,"00:23:27,718","00:23:28,853",You're kidding me.
396,"00:23:56,747","00:23:58,749","Tickets, anybody? Ticket?"
397,"00:24:29,312","00:24:30,411",Excuse me.
398,"00:24:30,413","00:24:31,679","You're gonna
wanna move on, pal."
399,"00:24:31,681","00:24:32,948",The AC's out in here.
400,"00:24:32,950","00:24:35,181","Actually, I was hoping
you could help me."
401,"00:24:35,183","00:24:37,419","I'm looking for someone.
A friend."
402,"00:24:37,421","00:24:39,021",Okay.
403,"00:24:39,023","00:24:40,822","They're going to Cold Spring,"
404,"00:24:40,824","00:24:43,224","and I was wondering
if you keep track"
405,"00:24:43,226","00:24:45,360","of where everyone
gets on and off the train."
406,"00:24:45,362","00:24:49,295","Yeah, I take pictures,
I hand out surveys, you know."
407,"00:24:49,297","00:24:51,033",I didn't mean it like that.
408,"00:24:51,035","00:24:53,768","Dude, it's tickets
and zones, okay?"
409,"00:24:53,770","00:24:54,903","They buy a ticket
for a station,"
410,"00:24:54,905","00:24:58,642","I punch the zone stub
and put it on the seat. Boom."
411,"00:25:00,209","00:25:03,812",Is that just day riders or...
412,"00:25:03,814","00:25:05,079","You said you're looking
for your friend, right?"
413,"00:25:05,081","00:25:06,112",Yeah.
414,"00:25:06,114","00:25:07,313","You don't know
what they look like?"
415,"00:25:07,315","00:25:09,082",You're asking me questions
416,"00:25:09,084","00:25:12,085","about passengers,
about protocol?"
417,"00:25:12,087","00:25:15,990","I know, it's stupid.
We only talked online."
418,"00:25:15,992","00:25:19,259","She said she'd be here.
Lives in Cold Spring."
419,"00:25:19,261","00:25:21,230",You're meeting an online date?
420,"00:25:22,331","00:25:24,134",On a metro train?
421,"00:25:26,703","00:25:30,106","Yeah, I can't help you, pal.
No one can."
422,"00:25:31,741","00:25:33,374","- Okay.
- All right."
423,"00:25:33,376","00:25:35,379",You take it easy. Good luck.
424,"00:25:56,033","00:25:58,867","Now arriving
110th Street Station, folks."
425,"00:26:08,377","00:26:10,013","You Michael?
Michael MacCauley?"
426,"00:26:10,780","00:26:12,013",Yeah.
427,"00:26:12,015","00:26:13,280","You found
what you're looking for?"
428,"00:26:13,282","00:26:15,019",What?
429,"00:26:18,153","00:26:19,923",Yo. Are we doing this?
430,"00:26:21,157","00:26:23,390","No. No, I can't."
431,"00:26:23,392","00:26:26,326","Yeah, they thought
you might say that."
432,"00:26:26,328","00:26:29,765","- Wait a minute. What is this?
- It's a warning."
433,"00:26:29,767","00:26:30,899","In case you haven't
figured it out yet,"
434,"00:26:30,901","00:26:32,036",they're watching you.
435,"00:26:36,906","00:26:39,474","Now leaving
110th Street Station."
436,"00:26:39,476","00:26:41,912","Next stop,
125th Street Station."
437,"00:27:08,939","00:27:11,071","- Tony, can I use your phone?
- What?"
438,"00:27:11,073","00:27:13,207","Your phone. Mine was stolen.
I have to make a call."
439,"00:27:13,209","00:27:16,243","It's an emergency.
Please. Please."
440,"00:27:16,245","00:27:19,112","Yeah, okay.
There's no service till 125th."
441,"00:27:19,114","00:27:20,481","Sometimes in the back,
if you're lucky."
442,"00:27:20,483","00:27:21,816","Thanks, Tony."
443,"00:27:21,818","00:27:23,219",Don't quit outta my game.
444,"00:27:30,393","00:27:32,526","You figure out
who she was?"
445,"00:27:32,528","00:27:35,831","The woman we saw earlier
that was eyeballing you."
446,"00:27:35,833","00:27:36,931",Huh?
447,"00:27:36,933","00:27:38,499","I figured
that's where you went,"
448,"00:27:38,501","00:27:39,770",looking for her.
449,"00:27:41,470","00:27:44,474","Hey, no judgment. I mean..."
450,"00:27:51,113","00:27:53,014","Mind if I borrow
the sports section?"
451,"00:27:53,016","00:27:56,283","- No. Yeah, sure. Here.
- Thanks."
452,"00:27:56,285","00:27:58,486","- The Yanks are playing the Sox.
- Uh-huh?"
453,"00:27:58,488","00:28:01,257","Five wins to clinch.
I'm feeling very confident."
454,"00:28:08,966","00:28:10,130","You know, my boy,"
455,"00:28:10,132","00:28:11,632","he won't let me
watch it on TV."
456,"00:28:11,634","00:28:15,871","He says it's bad
for my blood pressure."
457,"00:28:15,873","00:28:18,873","As if the Yanks winning would give
me a heart attack or something."
458,"00:28:18,875","00:28:20,411","Don't know why the kid
is so worried."
459,"00:28:22,277","00:28:25,412","Kid spends more time watching
me than he does at work."
460,"00:28:25,414","00:28:27,615","Yeah, and that is what I get"
461,"00:28:27,617","00:28:30,418","for teaching the kid
to do the right thing."
462,"00:28:30,420","00:28:32,586","Listen, I'm gonna stop
by a bar and get a beer."
463,"00:28:32,588","00:28:36,560","- Why don't you come with me?
- I can't."
464,"00:28:40,898","00:28:42,033",I gotta make a call.
465,"00:28:53,174","00:28:54,910","Come on, Karen, pick up."
466,"00:28:54,912","00:28:58,047","The mobile number you are
trying to reach is unavailable."
467,"00:29:01,182","00:29:03,351","2-3 Precinct.
- Detective Murphy, please."
468,"00:29:03,353","00:29:05,586",Please hold.
469,"00:29:05,588","00:29:07,956","He's not in. Can I transfer
you to his voice mail?"
470,"00:29:07,958","00:29:08,856","His cell, please."
471,"00:29:08,858","00:29:10,192","It's an emergency.
I'm a friend."
472,"00:29:12,327","00:29:14,028","Hey, Murph. It's Michael."
473,"00:29:14,030","00:29:17,567","Listen, I'm on the train
just before Harlem."
474,"00:29:20,236","00:29:22,003","I don't know
what the hell's happening."
475,"00:29:22,005","00:29:24,071","This woman
approached me out of nowhere."
476,"00:29:24,073","00:29:25,940","She wants me
to find a passenger"
477,"00:29:25,942","00:29:27,942",carrying some kind of bag.
478,"00:29:27,944","00:29:30,445","Murph, I think I've..."
479,"00:29:30,447","00:29:32,079",Just send someone to my house
480,"00:29:32,081","00:29:34,084","and call me back
at this number, okay?"
481,"00:29:42,358","00:29:46,527","Now arriving
125th Street Station, folks."
482,"00:29:46,529","00:29:49,633","I'll see you
on the next go-round."
483,"00:29:59,608","00:30:02,042","Now leaving
125th Street Station."
484,"00:30:02,044","00:30:05,047","Next stop, Yankee Stadium,
folks, Yankee Stadium."
485,"00:30:11,520","00:30:13,388",Murph? Hello?
486,"00:30:13,390","00:30:15,356","You accepted
the offer, Michael,"
487,"00:30:15,358","00:30:17,391",and then you broke the rules.
488,"00:30:17,393","00:30:19,627","Sorry, folks. We're
stopping due to a red signal."
489,"00:30:19,629","00:30:22,062","We should be on our way
in just a few minutes."
490,"00:30:22,064","00:30:24,130",What the hell is this?
491,"00:30:24,132","00:30:28,267","Look outside. Corner of
MLK and Lexington. Quickly, now."
492,"00:30:28,269","00:30:29,271",Southeast corner.
493,"00:30:39,016","00:30:40,648",What do you want from me?
494,"00:30:40,650","00:30:43,717","I want you to accept
responsibility."
495,"00:30:43,719","00:30:46,021","We all suffer
the burden of choice."
496,"00:30:46,023","00:30:48,590","No one forced you
to take that money."
497,"00:30:48,592","00:30:49,593",Do you see him?
498,"00:30:54,597","00:30:57,166","We can't have your friends
talking to the police."
499,"00:30:59,168","00:31:01,706","- I didn't tell him anything.
- We both know that's not true."
500,"00:31:08,309","00:31:09,311",Somebody get some help!
501,"00:31:11,080","00:31:13,581","Oh, my God.
What have you done?"
502,"00:31:13,583","00:31:15,682","You did this.
You made your choice."
503,"00:31:15,684","00:31:18,318",Find Prynne. Find the bag.
504,"00:31:18,320","00:31:21,589","Or there will be further
consequences."
505,"00:31:21,591","00:31:24,123","- Did you see what happened?
- You listen to me. Listen."
506,"00:31:24,125","00:31:26,794","No, you listen.
I can get to anyone anywhere."
507,"00:31:26,796","00:31:28,729","Your wife Karen,
your son Danny."
508,"00:31:28,731","00:31:33,332","You touch my wife, my son,
I swear to God..."
509,"00:31:33,334","00:31:35,302","I asked you to do
one little thing."
510,"00:31:35,304","00:31:37,471","Don't make it
more complicated than that."
511,"00:31:37,473","00:31:40,207","Don't make me
hurt someone you love."
512,"00:31:40,209","00:31:43,076","Wait, wait, wait."
513,"00:31:43,078","00:31:45,479","The day riders all have ticket
stubs in the back of their seats."
514,"00:31:45,481","00:31:47,113","I can narrow down
which passengers"
515,"00:31:47,115","00:31:48,615",are going to Cold Spring.
516,"00:31:48,617","00:31:50,485","- Now we're getting somewhere.
- What's in the bag?"
517,"00:31:50,487","00:31:51,753",What do I do when I find it?
518,"00:31:51,755","00:31:53,524","Check your
right jacket pocket."
519,"00:31:56,492","00:32:00,093","- Do you know what that is?
- It's a GPS tracker."
520,"00:32:00,095","00:32:02,362","Clearly your time as a police
officer wasn't for nothing."
521,"00:32:02,364","00:32:05,766","Plant the device on the bag,
and it's all over."
522,"00:32:05,768","00:32:06,767","Dobbs Ferry Station,"
523,"00:32:06,769","00:32:09,370","that's three stops,
arrives 7:00 p.m."
524,"00:32:09,372","00:32:11,371","- And, Michael?
- What?"
525,"00:32:11,373","00:32:13,376","Give the gentleman
back his phone."
526,"00:33:18,708","00:33:20,440","Do you know
who's sitting here?"
527,"00:33:20,442","00:33:21,545",Mmm-mmm.
528,"00:33:29,719","00:33:32,186","Excuse me. Does this train
go to Tenmile River?"
529,"00:33:32,188","00:33:34,389","- Yeah.
- Ah, I thought that."
530,"00:33:34,391","00:33:35,459",Thank you.
531,"00:34:16,297","00:34:18,932","Now arriving
Yankee Stadium, folks."
532,"00:34:18,934","00:34:20,436",Yankee Stadium.
533,"00:34:36,519","00:34:37,651",Um...
534,"00:34:37,653","00:34:39,686","Couldn't help
but overhear earlier."
535,"00:34:39,688","00:34:42,321","You're a broker, right?"
536,"00:34:42,323","00:34:44,858",Can I help you with something?
537,"00:34:44,860","00:34:46,796","I haven't seen you
on the train before."
538,"00:34:48,263","00:34:49,332",There's a reason for that.
539,"00:34:51,700","00:34:54,401",You riding for business or...
540,"00:34:54,403","00:34:57,338","Well, I... My wife and I
are getting ready to retire,"
541,"00:34:57,340","00:34:59,706","and we're looking
for a new broker."
542,"00:34:59,708","00:35:01,809","I work for one of the largest
investment banks in the world."
543,"00:35:01,811","00:35:03,010",Great. That's exactly...
544,"00:35:03,012","00:35:04,748","We don't represent
people like you."
545,"00:35:07,684","00:35:08,782",You're headed to Cold Spring.
546,"00:35:08,784","00:35:12,720","I figured maybe you were
seeing a client out there."
547,"00:35:12,722","00:35:14,523","What makes you think
I'm going to Cold Spring?"
548,"00:35:15,691","00:35:17,292","- I don't know.
- What's your deal, man?"
549,"00:35:18,028","00:35:19,292",Let me guess.
550,"00:35:19,294","00:35:21,762","The suit,
the shoes, the watch."
551,"00:35:21,764","00:35:23,196","You've probably
worked sales the last 20 years"
552,"00:35:23,198","00:35:26,369","and now you wanna turn your nest egg
into a three-week timeshare in Maui."
553,"00:35:43,319","00:35:45,319",Yeah.
554,"00:35:45,321","00:35:46,720","No, you got me
on a train to nowhere."
555,"00:35:46,722","00:35:48,789","Seriously, I never should
have left Goldman Sachs."
556,"00:35:48,791","00:35:50,390","Hey, Goldman Sachs."
557,"00:35:50,392","00:35:53,463","On behalf of the American
middle class, fuck you."
558,"00:35:57,467","00:35:59,733","Sorry, Ma. Go ahead."
559,"00:35:59,735","00:36:00,871","No, it was nothing."
560,"00:36:10,479","00:36:13,045","- Long day, huh, Sherri?
- Yeah."
561,"00:36:13,047","00:36:14,881","But you've been busy, huh,"
562,"00:36:14,883","00:36:17,049","up and down
the aisle the whole time."
563,"00:36:17,051","00:36:19,354","Karen's been on at me
to get more exercise."
564,"00:36:19,356","00:36:21,588","It's either the train
or Pilates."
565,"00:36:22,758","00:36:26,360","- How is the family?
- Good. Good."
566,"00:36:26,362","00:36:28,628","Danny's headed off
to Syracuse."
567,"00:36:28,630","00:36:30,096",Wow. You must be really proud.
568,"00:36:30,098","00:36:32,499",Yeah. He's trying to decide
569,"00:36:32,501","00:36:34,434","between the dorms
or an apartment,"
570,"00:36:34,436","00:36:36,570",the dorms or an apartment...
571,"00:36:37,706","00:36:40,072",Excuse me. Hello?
572,"00:36:40,074","00:36:45,445","You go to Columbia, right?
T-shirt."
573,"00:36:45,447","00:36:49,452","Are you a photography student?
I noticed your camera case."
574,"00:36:52,521","00:36:54,525","I don't know... Um, I'm sorry."
575,"00:36:58,795","00:37:00,431","Millennials, huh?"
576,"00:37:06,970","00:37:08,702","Excuse me.
Could you just wait?"
577,"00:37:08,704","00:37:10,738","- Now arriving Dobbs Ferry.
- Hey."
578,"00:37:10,740","00:37:11,972",I only wanna talk.
579,"00:37:11,974","00:37:14,474","Oh, jeez!"
580,"00:37:14,476","00:37:17,815","What are you doing?
Are you crazy?"
581,"00:37:18,581","00:37:19,680",What is this?
582,"00:37:19,682","00:37:21,548","Nothing. Can you just...
Stop it."
583,"00:37:21,550","00:37:22,416",Fake IDs?
584,"00:37:22,418","00:37:24,751","They're not mine,
I swear to God."
585,"00:37:24,753","00:37:25,820","They're my boyfriend's,"
586,"00:37:25,822","00:37:27,421","and he asked me
if I could carry it"
587,"00:37:27,423","00:37:29,425",because he would get caught.
588,"00:37:31,093","00:37:32,593",Are you a cop?
589,"00:37:32,595","00:37:33,961","No, I'm not a cop."
590,"00:37:33,963","00:37:35,963","But, listen,
if he really cared about you,"
591,"00:37:35,965","00:37:38,568","he wouldn't ask you
to do something like this."
592,"00:37:39,969","00:37:41,601","Yeah, okay."
593,"00:37:41,603","00:37:43,503",Now leaving Dobbs Ferry.
594,"00:37:43,505","00:37:45,508","Next stop, Tarrytown."
595,"00:38:10,532","00:38:11,865",Are you sure?
596,"00:38:11,867","00:38:13,468",Maybe it's nothing.
597,"00:38:13,470","00:38:16,037","Look, they were all sitting
together, three of them."
598,"00:38:16,039","00:38:18,138","- Right.
- At 125th they split up,"
599,"00:38:18,140","00:38:19,941",each to a different car.
600,"00:38:19,943","00:38:22,008","I don't know, it felt weird."
601,"00:38:22,010","00:38:23,945","I'm only authorized
to search a bag"
602,"00:38:23,947","00:38:25,512",if it's been left behind.
603,"00:38:25,514","00:38:27,214","You know
I ride this line every day."
604,"00:38:27,216","00:38:29,149","Like I said,
maybe it's nothing,"
605,"00:38:29,151","00:38:32,519","but ""see something,
say something,"" right?"
606,"00:38:32,521","00:38:34,824","- You point 'em out to me?
- Yeah."
607,"00:38:39,160","00:38:41,796",The woman there.
608,"00:38:41,798","00:38:43,630",The nurse.
609,"00:38:43,632","00:38:44,831","Man in the second car,"
610,"00:38:44,833","00:38:46,834","African-American,
with a guitar."
611,"00:38:46,836","00:38:50,173","Another in the last car.
All going to Cold Spring."
612,"00:39:13,862","00:39:15,127","Excuse me, ma'am."
613,"00:39:15,129","00:39:18,532","I have to carry out
some random security checks,"
614,"00:39:18,534","00:39:20,214","and I just need to take
a look in your bag."
615,"00:39:20,536","00:39:21,470",Why?
616,"00:39:21,472","00:39:22,604","I just need to take
a look in your bag."
617,"00:39:22,606","00:39:24,639","Hey, hey, hey! What do
you think you're doing?"
618,"00:39:24,641","00:39:26,306","- It's a random security check.
- I know my rights."
619,"00:39:26,308","00:39:27,407",Get back to your books.
620,"00:39:27,409","00:39:30,577","I just need to take
a look in your bag, ma'am."
621,"00:39:30,579","00:39:33,947","Why me?
Seriously, why me? Why my bag?"
622,"00:39:34,985","00:39:36,315","You're disturbing
everybody, ma'am."
623,"00:39:36,317","00:39:37,718",Please just keep it down.
624,"00:39:37,720","00:39:40,021","Now, please,
just open your bag."
625,"00:39:40,023","00:39:42,622","I asked you nicely, ma'am."
626,"00:39:42,624","00:39:44,659","- Just, please, open your bag.
- I'm a nurse. Come on."
627,"00:39:44,661","00:39:45,760","Sorry, sir."
628,"00:39:45,762","00:39:46,994","I help people.
I don't kill them."
629,"00:39:46,996","00:39:49,796","I just told you, ma'am,
it's a random security check."
630,"00:39:49,798","00:39:51,032","Do me a favor, will you?"
631,"00:39:51,034","00:39:52,800","Just open your bag.
I'm sorry, sir."
632,"00:39:52,802","00:39:54,872","Just open up your bag,
and I'll be on my way."
633,"00:40:02,010","00:40:03,977","Got a visual, but I can't
get to anything yet."
634,"00:40:03,979","00:40:05,715",I just need a bit more time.
635,"00:40:16,592","00:40:18,190","- Who are you?
- Calm down."
636,"00:40:18,192","00:40:19,595",Why are you following me?
637,"00:40:21,630","00:40:23,363","Are you the reason
they're searching passengers?"
638,"00:40:23,365","00:40:26,067","- Prynne?
- What did you say?"
639,"00:40:50,793","00:40:53,630",Who are you? What do you know?
640,"00:40:56,666","00:40:58,163",What...
641,"00:40:58,165","00:40:59,132","Whatever you think
you're doing,"
642,"00:40:59,134","00:41:02,170","you know what's good for you,
let it go."
643,"00:41:05,907","00:41:08,143","Hey, man, are you okay?"
644,"00:41:10,245","00:41:11,782",Yeah.
645,"00:41:18,252","00:41:22,892","You see that? Scumbag.
Tried to steal my wallet."
646,"00:41:36,238","00:41:38,207",This train's freaking me out.
647,"00:42:00,396","00:42:02,932",Hello? What?
648,"00:42:05,100","00:42:06,803",Who is this?
649,"00:42:10,138","00:42:11,842",All right.
650,"00:42:17,713","00:42:20,115","Mike, it's for you.
Some guy says he's a cop."
651,"00:42:22,317","00:42:24,818","You don't look so good.
Everything all right?"
652,"00:42:24,820","00:42:26,822","Give me a minute, will you?"
653,"00:42:27,389","00:42:29,423","- Murph.
- Mike."
654,"00:42:29,425","00:42:30,958",You sent someone to the house?
655,"00:42:30,960","00:42:33,326","Tarrytown local.
They're on their way."
656,"00:42:33,328","00:42:35,930",What the hell's going on?
657,"00:42:35,932","00:42:37,965",Mike?
658,"00:42:37,967","00:42:41,100","This woman sits across from
me, calls herself Joanna."
659,"00:42:41,102","00:42:44,972","She offers me 100 grand
to find someone on the train."
660,"00:42:44,974","00:42:49,343","- They want his bag.
- 100 grand? What kind of bag?"
661,"00:42:49,345","00:42:53,212","I don't know.
Look, it sounds crazy."
662,"00:42:53,214","00:42:55,047","They threatened
Karen and Danny."
663,"00:42:55,049","00:42:57,317","They killed a man, Murph,
pushed him into the street."
664,"00:42:57,319","00:43:02,054","Jesus Christ. Uh... Okay.
You still on the train?"
665,"00:43:02,056","00:43:04,492","- Yeah.
- All right, don't do anything."
666,"00:43:04,494","00:43:07,159","I'm gonna call a friend at
the transportation authority."
667,"00:43:07,161","00:43:09,396","I found him, Murph.
I didn't have a choice."
668,"00:43:09,398","00:43:12,532","- What did you do?
- They gave me a GPS tracker."
669,"00:43:12,534","00:43:15,134","The kid's late 20s,
black duffle bag."
670,"00:43:15,136","00:43:17,371","A snake-head tattoo
on his neck."
671,"00:43:17,373","00:43:20,006",Goes by the name of Prynne.
672,"00:43:20,008","00:43:21,876",Prynne?
673,"00:43:21,878","00:43:23,880","Did you take the money, Mike?"
674,"00:43:26,516","00:43:28,883","You want my help
as a detective or as a friend?"
675,"00:43:28,885","00:43:31,785","'Cause it's two very
different things."
676,"00:43:31,787","00:43:33,854","What are you
not telling me, Murph?"
677,"00:43:33,856","00:43:35,956","Two nights ago,"
678,"00:43:35,958","00:43:38,025","a buddy of mine in the ninth
caught a suicide downtown,"
679,"00:43:38,027","00:43:40,461","a staffer in the city
planning office."
680,"00:43:40,463","00:43:42,796",It's all over the news.
681,"00:43:42,798","00:43:46,334","Thing is, this kid was in deep
with the wrong kind of people."
682,"00:43:47,503","00:43:49,836","There's a witness
who saw two guys"
683,"00:43:49,838","00:43:51,807","drop him 35 stories
out a window."
684,"00:43:53,274","00:43:55,076",Witness goes by Prynne.
685,"00:43:56,378","00:43:58,143",And I identified him.
686,"00:43:58,145","00:44:01,147","Someone on this train's
gonna kill him. Jesus."
687,"00:44:01,149","00:44:02,849","I had an altercation
with the guy."
688,"00:44:02,851","00:44:04,351",I got a bag full of cash.
689,"00:44:04,353","00:44:06,356",I just lost my job.
690,"00:44:07,423","00:44:10,023",She's trying to set me up.
691,"00:44:10,025","00:44:11,458","All right, this is
what you're gonna do."
692,"00:44:11,460","00:44:13,796","Next stop, get..."
693,"00:44:15,597","00:44:18,768",Murph? Hello? Murph?
694,"00:44:22,003","00:44:24,304",You done?
695,"00:44:24,306","00:44:26,974","Come on, man. What the
hell is wrong with you?"
696,"00:44:26,976","00:44:29,074","Sorry, Tony. Thanks."
697,"00:44:29,076","00:44:31,882","Great. Thanks for using
my battery up, asshole."
698,"00:44:40,154","00:44:42,121","Why are we meeting
a witness outside the city?"
699,"00:44:42,123","00:44:43,159",It feels wrong.
700,"00:44:45,060","00:44:47,060",Twenty minutes.
701,"00:44:47,062","00:44:49,530","All right. I'm checking in
with Agent Foster."
702,"00:44:49,532","00:44:51,934","As long as the witness
gets off that train."
703,"00:45:21,429","00:45:22,898",Everything all right?
704,"00:47:04,467","00:47:06,199","Look what you did, Michael."
705,"00:47:06,201","00:47:07,269",Another dead passenger.
706,"00:47:10,205","00:47:11,671",This man was a federal agent.
707,"00:47:11,673","00:47:14,608","Yes, but he's not Prynne.
You marked the wrong man."
708,"00:47:14,610","00:47:17,010","- You killed him.
- Whose fault is that?"
709,"00:47:17,012","00:47:19,380","- I didn't agree to this.
- You tell yourself that."
710,"00:47:19,382","00:47:20,780","I know you think
you're a good man,"
711,"00:47:20,782","00:47:22,615","but some part of you
was willing."
712,"00:47:22,617","00:47:25,385","Some part of you capable
of condemning a stranger"
713,"00:47:25,387","00:47:26,519",to an unknown fate.
714,"00:47:26,521","00:47:28,122",I'm done playing games.
715,"00:47:34,161","00:47:35,628","The mobile
number you are trying to..."
716,"00:47:35,630","00:47:38,166","- Shit.
- ...reach is unavailable."
717,"00:47:41,335","00:47:42,568",I wanna talk to my wife.
718,"00:47:42,570","00:47:44,170","Stay with me, Michael."
719,"00:47:44,172","00:47:45,671",You still have a job to do.
720,"00:47:45,673","00:47:47,205",I will not do a goddamn thing
721,"00:47:47,207","00:47:50,275","until I know my wife
and my son are okay."
722,"00:47:50,277","00:47:52,281","They're just leaving
the house now."
723,"00:47:55,082","00:47:57,818","Mom, come on.
We're gonna be late."
724,"00:47:57,820","00:48:00,152","Danny,
have you seen my ring?"
725,"00:48:00,154","00:48:02,424","I swear I left it
on the bathroom counter."
726,"00:48:04,392","00:48:05,793",Have you asked Dad?
727,"00:48:05,795","00:48:08,326","He's not
picking up his phone as usual."
728,"00:48:11,434","00:48:13,436","Mom, who is that?"
729,"00:48:14,603","00:48:18,140","Danny, get in the car.
Lock the door."
730,"00:48:19,809","00:48:21,407",Can I help you?
731,"00:48:21,409","00:48:25,243","- Are you Karen MacCauley?
- Yes."
732,"00:48:25,245","00:48:27,680","I'm here because
of your husband."
733,"00:48:27,682","00:48:29,615",I'm sorry. Do I know...
734,"00:48:34,456","00:48:37,523","You have
a beautiful family, Michael."
735,"00:48:37,525","00:48:39,693",Now arriving Tarrytown.
736,"00:48:39,695","00:48:41,695","There are police
on their way right now."
737,"00:48:41,697","00:48:42,595",If your men try anything...
738,"00:48:42,597","00:48:43,731","Yes, they were, Michael.
They were."
739,"00:48:43,733","00:48:46,400","Until you called too much
attention to yourself."
740,"00:48:46,402","00:48:48,301","- What?
- Look outside."
741,"00:48:48,303","00:48:51,103","Someone reported a dangerous
individual on the train."
742,"00:48:51,105","00:48:54,541","Now you're standing over
a corpse. Do the math."
743,"00:48:54,543","00:48:55,675",What do you want me to do?
744,"00:48:55,677","00:48:58,781","Don't leave the train
and don't get caught."
745,"00:49:26,140","00:49:27,306","I've been doing this
a long time."
746,"00:49:27,308","00:49:28,909","I'm telling you,
he's a regular."
747,"00:49:28,911","00:49:30,143",I don't think he's dangerous.
748,"00:49:30,145","00:49:33,145","The guy claims he's looking
for someone onboard, right?"
749,"00:49:33,147","00:49:34,914","He makes up
some bullshit story"
750,"00:49:34,916","00:49:36,782","about suspicious bags,"
751,"00:49:36,784","00:49:38,520",and then he gets into a fight.
752,"00:50:28,871","00:50:30,470","Sorry for the delay, folks."
753,"00:50:30,472","00:50:32,241",We'll be on our way very soon.
754,"00:50:34,543","00:50:36,275","Compartments
one and two all clear."
755,"00:50:36,277","00:50:37,811","- Call the captain.
- Yes, sir."
756,"00:50:37,813","00:50:40,414","Got two and three clear.
Three and four clear."
757,"00:50:40,416","00:50:42,615","Compartments
five and six clear."
758,"00:50:42,617","00:50:43,950","No, he's not here."
759,"00:50:43,952","00:50:45,588","Okay, wrap it up, boys."
760,"00:52:56,684","00:52:57,950","That was impressive, Michael."
761,"00:52:57,952","00:52:59,686","I almost thought
you were gonna miss the train."
762,"00:52:59,688","00:53:01,488","I wanna talk
to my wife and my son."
763,"00:53:01,490","00:53:02,555",I wanna know they're safe.
764,"00:53:02,557","00:53:04,724","There are two more stops
before Cold Spring."
765,"00:53:04,726","00:53:06,459","Garrison Station
is your last chance,"
766,"00:53:06,461","00:53:08,628","if you ever wanna
talk to them again."
767,"00:53:08,630","00:53:11,497","I need more time.
There isn't enough to go on."
768,"00:53:11,499","00:53:13,132","You've proven
yourself capable."
769,"00:53:13,134","00:53:14,534",Figure it out.
770,"00:53:36,391","00:53:37,923","Hey, Manny, AC's cut out."
771,"00:53:37,925","00:53:39,526","I'm gonna check
the hub in three."
772,"00:53:39,528","00:53:40,760","- Copy that.
- Hi. Excuse me."
773,"00:53:40,762","00:53:42,496","It's, like,
90 degrees in here."
774,"00:53:42,498","00:53:44,664","Yeah, working on it, ma'am.
Working on it."
775,"00:53:44,666","00:53:46,165","Tarrytown.
I thought you got off."
776,"00:53:46,167","00:53:47,670",Sam.
777,"00:53:51,407","00:53:53,673",You lucky son of a bitch.
778,"00:53:55,677","00:53:58,811","My dad said it pays
to make new friends."
779,"00:53:58,813","00:54:00,816","- You wanna go again?
- Yep."
780,"00:54:11,427","00:54:13,058","Ladies and gentlemen,
I'm sure you've noticed"
781,"00:54:13,060","00:54:16,430","we've lost AC in all cars
except the last one."
782,"00:54:16,432","00:54:17,930","If you wanna move, please,"
783,"00:54:17,932","00:54:19,900","remember your belongings.
Thank you."
784,"00:54:19,902","00:54:21,100","Ladies and gentlemen,
I'm sure you've noticed"
785,"00:54:21,102","00:54:24,503","we've entered the seventh
circle of hell. God damn it."
786,"00:54:44,091","00:54:47,129","Gonna be a hell of a ride
to Cold Spring."
787,"00:54:58,974","00:55:02,709","All right.
Two pairs. Queens. Fours."
788,"00:55:02,711","00:55:05,845","- Hey, Tony, deal me in?
- Your money to lose, pal."
789,"00:55:05,847","00:55:07,149","Come on in, Mike."
790,"00:55:08,248","00:55:10,983",I got 100 to my name.
791,"00:55:10,985","00:55:12,150","All right, Texas hold 'em."
792,"00:55:12,152","00:55:13,623","- Good?
- Sure."
793,"00:55:14,755","00:55:15,891",Okay. Gentlemen.
794,"00:55:18,158","00:55:19,862",Take a peek.
795,"00:55:28,570","00:55:31,505","- Doing all right there, pal?
- You don't wanna know."
796,"00:55:31,507","00:55:32,771","You should have got off
two stops ago."
797,"00:55:32,773","00:55:34,038",Ten years I ride this train.
798,"00:55:34,040","00:55:36,642","Maybe one time I wanna see
the end of the line."
799,"00:55:36,644","00:55:38,914","- Why?
- What about you, friend?"
800,"00:55:39,780","00:55:41,615",What about me?
801,"00:55:41,617","00:55:43,786","Never seen you
on this train before."
802,"00:55:44,720","00:55:46,619","Well, I've never
seen you either."
803,"00:55:46,621","00:55:48,790","- You're not a regular.
- What is that to you?"
804,"00:55:51,527","00:55:53,793",All right.
805,"00:55:53,795","00:55:55,662","I think your friend here's
got a problem with me."
806,"00:55:55,664","00:55:58,063","- Relax.
- Just making conversation."
807,"00:55:58,065","00:55:59,163",That's all.
808,"00:55:59,165","00:56:01,767","Well, if you wanna
say something,"
809,"00:56:01,769","00:56:04,673",why don't you say it?
810,"00:56:05,907","00:56:09,141","It just occurred to me
that most of us,"
811,"00:56:09,143","00:56:10,610",we ride this train every day.
812,"00:56:10,612","00:56:13,546",We nod. We say hello.
813,"00:56:13,548","00:56:15,881","But how much do we really
know about each other?"
814,"00:56:15,883","00:56:19,083","What about you, Mike?
What do we know about you?"
815,"00:56:19,085","00:56:20,686",Fair enough.
816,"00:56:20,688","00:56:22,689",I got fired today.
817,"00:56:22,691","00:56:26,825","Yeah. Didn't have the guts
to tell my wife."
818,"00:56:26,827","00:56:29,695","Yeah. Have to go home,
look my son in the eye."
819,"00:56:29,697","00:56:31,297",What am I supposed to say?
820,"00:56:31,299","00:56:34,232","""I'm not the man
you thought I was""?"
821,"00:56:34,234","00:56:36,705","What kind of father?
What kind of husband?"
822,"00:56:38,172","00:56:42,842","60 years old.
What have I got left to offer?"
823,"00:56:42,844","00:56:46,579","- That was extremely honest.
- And I thought my life sucked."
824,"00:56:46,581","00:56:47,981",Are we gonna play or what?
825,"00:56:47,983","00:56:50,051",Right.
826,"00:56:51,152","00:56:53,820",I'm out.
827,"00:56:53,822","00:56:57,056","So, I heard something
earlier today,"
828,"00:56:57,058","00:56:59,058","- a hypothetical question.
- Uh-huh."
829,"00:56:59,060","00:57:00,693",What was the question?
830,"00:57:00,695","00:57:03,597","What if someone asked you
to do one little thing,"
831,"00:57:03,599","00:57:05,096","something that's
meaningless to you,"
832,"00:57:05,098","00:57:07,733","but would affect another
passenger on this train?"
833,"00:57:07,735","00:57:10,704",Would you do it?
834,"00:57:10,706","00:57:12,203","I don't know.
What's in it for me?"
835,"00:57:12,205","00:57:14,608","$100,000."
836,"00:57:14,610","00:57:15,608",Absolutely.
837,"00:57:15,610","00:57:16,976","You don't
even know what it is."
838,"00:57:16,978","00:57:19,078",It doesn't matter. Come on.
839,"00:57:19,080","00:57:22,281","So what is
that one little thing?"
840,"00:57:22,283","00:57:24,718","A passenger on this train
doesn't belong."
841,"00:57:24,720","00:57:25,885","They're carrying a bag,"
842,"00:57:25,887","00:57:27,152","but you don't know
what it looks like."
843,"00:57:27,154","00:57:28,854",All you have to do
844,"00:57:28,856","00:57:31,255","is find them
before they get off."
845,"00:57:31,257","00:57:34,092","That's it?
It's not much to go on, Mike."
846,"00:57:34,094","00:57:35,159",Tell me about it.
847,"00:57:35,161","00:57:37,396","What happens
when you find 'em?"
848,"00:57:37,398","00:57:40,036",They die. Hypothetically.
849,"00:57:41,036","00:57:43,301","So what would you do, Mike?"
850,"00:57:43,303","00:57:46,170","I'd get all the people
left on the train in one car,"
851,"00:57:46,172","00:57:48,708",propose that very scenario.
852,"00:57:48,710","00:57:49,909","No, no, no, no."
853,"00:57:49,911","00:57:51,191","I mean, would you
take the money?"
854,"00:57:54,382","00:57:58,920",You know what? I already did.
855,"00:58:01,321","00:58:05,156","- You see, I count five.
- Five what?"
856,"00:58:05,158","00:58:07,394","Five people left
that don't belong."
857,"00:58:07,396","00:58:09,929","Five people on this train
that I've never seen before."
858,"00:58:09,931","00:58:10,965",The lady right here.
859,"00:58:12,934","00:58:15,934","The young girl with the
pink hair at the window."
860,"00:58:15,936","00:58:18,003",Mr. Goldman Sachs over there.
861,"00:58:18,005","00:58:20,307",My friend with the guitar.
862,"00:58:23,210","00:58:24,212",And you.
863,"00:58:28,883","00:58:30,118",I'm Jackson.
864,"00:58:34,423","00:58:36,822","- You know what I would do?
- Tell me."
865,"00:58:36,824","00:58:39,025","I would pocket that 100 grand,"
866,"00:58:39,027","00:58:41,159","find the guy,"
867,"00:58:41,161","00:58:42,898","tell him to
take a different train."
868,"00:58:46,434","00:58:47,969",All right.
869,"00:58:50,338","00:58:53,105","- All in.
- Whoa. Whoa."
870,"00:58:53,107","00:58:55,378",For real? All right.
871,"00:59:01,717","00:59:03,950","So, you never
answered the question."
872,"00:59:03,952","00:59:04,983",What question?
873,"00:59:04,985","00:59:06,385","What are you doing
on this train?"
874,"00:59:06,387","00:59:08,722",Maybe I'm like you.
875,"00:59:08,724","00:59:10,321","Maybe I wanna
see the end of the line."
876,"00:59:10,323","00:59:12,126",Wait a minute. Excuse me.
877,"00:59:13,094","00:59:14,994",I call.
878,"00:59:14,996","00:59:17,867","This is a monthly pass.
You're a regular commuter."
879,"00:59:18,934","00:59:22,004",Yeah. And I have a full house.
880,"00:59:22,737","00:59:24,268",Oh!
881,"00:59:24,270","00:59:26,675","- What do you have?
- That's it for me."
882,"00:59:27,842","00:59:29,344",I'm sorry.
883,"00:59:40,021","00:59:42,825","So what if I'm this guy
you're talking about?"
884,"00:59:43,758","00:59:45,892","- Are you?
- If I was?"
885,"00:59:45,894","00:59:48,092",Someone wants you dead.
886,"00:59:48,094","00:59:50,764","I can help you, but I need
to know what you know,"
887,"00:59:50,766","00:59:52,297","why you're going
to Cold Spring,"
888,"00:59:52,299","00:59:54,098",what's in that case.
889,"00:59:54,100","00:59:57,101","- It's just a guitar.
- Open it."
890,"00:59:57,103","00:59:59,237","You wanna help me?
Why should I trust you?"
891,"00:59:59,239","01:00:00,308",Open the case.
892,"01:00:18,192","01:00:19,858",So what do we do now?
893,"01:00:19,860","01:00:23,429","You and I go to carriage one,
barricade ourselves inside."
894,"01:00:23,431","01:00:25,030","And then, what,
you gonna find this killer,"
895,"01:00:25,032","01:00:26,165",take him down yourself?
896,"01:00:26,167","01:00:27,436",Gonna try.
897,"01:00:28,570","01:00:31,072","Obviously, I'm not Prynne."
898,"01:00:34,008","01:00:36,342","But you seem to have
figured that out already."
899,"01:00:36,344","01:00:37,811",That's a left-handed guitar.
900,"01:00:37,813","01:00:39,448",What's that got to do with it?
901,"01:00:40,916","01:00:42,818","Hey, man, are you okay?"
902,"01:00:46,021","01:00:47,085",Yeah.
903,"01:00:47,087","01:00:48,521",The gun's in your right hand.
904,"01:00:48,523","01:00:51,290","Well, shit."
905,"01:00:51,292","01:00:53,228","I guess that's why
she chose you."
906,"01:00:54,829","01:00:57,164","Four passengers left.
Which one is it?"
907,"01:00:58,299","01:01:00,232",I don't know.
908,"01:01:00,234","01:01:03,970","All you got to lose
and you don't know."
909,"01:01:03,972","01:01:05,438",You killed that agent.
910,"01:01:05,440","01:01:07,439","No, that's on you, man."
911,"01:01:07,441","01:01:10,074","How much is she paying you
to kill the witness?"
912,"01:01:10,076","01:01:11,945","Same as you, I guess."
913,"01:01:11,947","01:01:14,246","But that's not really
how it works out, is it?"
914,"01:01:14,248","01:01:17,252","No matter how much they pay,
you always end up owing more."
915,"01:01:19,185","01:01:22,256","Who's Prynne, Michael?
Tell me now."
916,"01:01:23,358","01:01:25,059",No.
917,"01:01:26,528","01:01:29,461","You have no idea
who you're up against."
918,"01:01:29,463","01:01:34,067","- Do you?
- Yes, Michael. I do."
919,"01:01:35,637","01:01:39,140","- Drop it.
- Take it easy."
920,"01:01:45,078","01:01:46,548",Turn around.
921,"01:02:30,925","01:02:32,691",Who's Prynne?
922,"01:02:32,693","01:02:35,293","- I don't know.
- You're lying."
923,"01:03:14,635","01:03:16,601",Don't be stupid. Stop.
924,"01:03:16,603","01:03:18,606",Not until Prynne is dead.
925,"01:03:20,641","01:03:22,644",I can't let you do that.
926,"01:04:14,762","01:04:17,430","You're out of time.
Who's Prynne?"
927,"01:04:17,432","01:04:20,168","It doesn't matter.
Your guy is dead."
928,"01:04:22,036","01:04:24,038",You have the gun?
929,"01:04:26,172","01:04:28,543","Take it, Michael.
Take the weapon."
930,"01:04:31,277","01:04:36,313","Kill Prynne, retrieve the bag,
and your family lives."
931,"01:04:36,315","01:04:39,718","- I am not gonna do this.
- You can't have it both ways."
932,"01:04:39,720","01:04:43,423","You can save the witness
or your family."
933,"01:04:43,425","01:04:46,123","You know who Prynne is,
don't you?"
934,"01:04:46,125","01:04:48,161","It's time to finish
what you started."
935,"01:04:53,534","01:04:55,468","Now arriving Garrison, folks."
936,"01:04:55,470","01:04:57,737","Hey, Mike, what happened
to the guy with the guitar?"
937,"01:04:57,739","01:04:59,407",He got off.
938,"01:05:02,577","01:05:04,543","I better not be staying at
a bed and breakfast this time."
939,"01:05:04,545","01:05:06,146",Uh-uh. No way.
940,"01:05:13,487","01:05:15,588","Next stop, Cold Spring."
941,"01:05:15,590","01:05:18,027","This train terminates
at Cold Spring."
942,"01:05:37,310","01:05:40,481","- All that's left is you.
- What?"
943,"01:05:43,485","01:05:46,418","Why are you going
to Cold Spring?"
944,"01:05:46,420","01:05:48,790",That's none of your business.
945,"01:05:51,592","01:05:53,726","- What's in the bag?
- My God."
946,"01:05:53,728","01:05:56,664","What is with you people
and my bag? Jeez."
947,"01:05:57,398","01:05:58,731","- Hey.
- Prynne?"
948,"01:05:58,733","01:06:00,132",What are you doing?
949,"01:06:00,134","01:06:01,333","- Let go of me.
- I'm trying to help you."
950,"01:06:01,335","01:06:02,802","Seriously, come on, do something."
951,"01:06:02,804","01:06:04,470","- Who is that?
- What's your problem?"
952,"01:06:04,472","01:06:05,671","Mike, you gotta let the lady go."
953,"01:06:05,673","01:06:06,905","You don't get it, do you?"
954,"01:06:06,907","01:06:08,740","She wants you dead.
You witnessed a murder."
955,"01:06:08,742","01:06:10,409","You have something
that she wants,"
956,"01:06:10,411","01:06:11,843","something she's
willing to kill for."
957,"01:06:11,845","01:06:14,412","Okay, Mike, you gotta let her go.
Let the lady go."
958,"01:06:14,414","01:06:15,514","- Mike.
- Hand me the phone."
959,"01:06:15,516","01:06:16,583","Mike, come on."
960,"01:06:16,585","01:06:18,420","Don't move. Don't move.
Stay in your seats."
961,"01:06:21,755","01:06:23,424","Please, hand me the phone."
962,"01:06:46,947","01:06:47,914",I... I don't...
963,"01:06:47,916","01:06:51,517","Look, I don't know
what your problem is,"
964,"01:06:51,519","01:06:55,521","but I am not the person
you're looking for, okay?"
965,"01:06:55,523","01:07:01,593","My... My boyfriend and I,
we had this huge fight"
966,"01:07:01,595","01:07:05,601","because I wasn't sure about
staying here and us and..."
967,"01:07:07,201","01:07:08,867","So when I finished my shift,"
968,"01:07:08,869","01:07:11,472","I... I just didn't
wanna go home."
969,"01:07:13,207","01:07:16,143",Forgive me. Take it. Take it.
970,"01:07:16,878","01:07:18,347",I'm sorry.
971,"01:07:20,347","01:07:21,816",They're gonna kill my family.
972,"01:07:23,216","01:07:25,218",There's no one else.
973,"01:07:26,621","01:07:29,724","Six day riders.
Six ticket stubs."
974,"01:07:30,757","01:07:32,760",Six going to Cold Spring.
975,"01:07:34,328","01:07:39,333","Except... One got off
at Garrison."
976,"01:07:41,635","01:07:46,874","Goldman Sachs.
He... He was in the aisle."
977,"01:07:48,775","01:07:50,343",Bye-bye.
978,"01:07:50,345","01:07:51,847",He switched seats.
979,"01:08:14,902","01:08:16,405",Prynne.
980,"01:08:17,671","01:08:20,474","Hester Prynne.
The Scarlet Letter. Of course."
981,"01:08:22,543","01:08:24,212","You bought the ticket
to Cold Spring."
982,"01:08:26,681","01:08:29,481","End of the line.
Cold Spring coming up."
983,"01:08:32,285","01:08:34,020",Is it done?
984,"01:08:34,022","01:08:35,887","- Is it done?
- I will not do this."
985,"01:08:35,889","01:08:37,355","I thought
I had you figured out."
986,"01:08:37,357","01:08:38,427",I really did.
987,"01:08:40,561","01:08:41,726",Manny?
988,"01:08:41,728","01:08:43,429","After all of this, you would
choose the life of a stranger"
989,"01:08:43,431","01:08:44,829",over your own family?
990,"01:08:44,831","01:08:46,832","You must think
you're some kind of a hero."
991,"01:08:46,834","01:08:48,300",I won't do this.
992,"01:08:48,302","01:08:49,769","I won't do it.
I will not do this."
993,"01:08:49,771","01:08:51,971","Manny, Manny,
we have a hostage situation."
994,"01:08:51,973","01:08:53,939",Calling dispatch.
995,"01:08:53,941","01:08:56,041","This is your
last chance, Michael."
996,"01:08:56,043","01:08:57,376","- Do it.
- No."
997,"01:08:57,378","01:08:58,644",Prynne has evidence
998,"01:08:58,646","01:08:59,979","- of a conspiracy.
- That doesn't matter."
999,"01:08:59,981","01:09:02,448","The people I work for,
they will do anything"
1000,"01:09:02,450","01:09:03,649","- to protect themselves.
- What?"
1001,"01:09:03,651","01:09:04,850","These are
very powerful people."
1002,"01:09:04,852","01:09:06,083","They will do
whatever it takes."
1003,"01:09:06,085","01:09:07,284","They? Who?
Who are you talking about?"
1004,"01:09:07,286","01:09:09,855","Even kill you, your family.
Everyone on that train."
1005,"01:09:09,857","01:09:11,089","- Do you understand?
- Who's they?"
1006,"01:09:11,091","01:09:13,525",You have made your choice.
1007,"01:09:13,527","01:09:15,327","Joanna, who are
you working for?"
1008,"01:09:15,329","01:09:16,930",Now everyone dies.
1009,"01:09:18,866","01:09:19,868",Hel...
1010,"01:09:22,836","01:09:24,068","Dispatch
is contacting the police."
1011,"01:09:24,070","01:09:25,471",Stop the train.
1012,"01:09:25,473","01:09:26,739",Copy that.
1013,"01:09:27,909","01:09:30,876","You want to live, you stop
this goddamn train now."
1014,"01:09:30,878","01:09:33,077",Pull the brake. Now.
1015,"01:09:33,079","01:09:36,617","All right.
Now, everyone, hang on."
1016,"01:09:46,760","01:09:49,362","Yeah, thanks."
1017,"01:09:49,364","01:09:51,364","Train's less than
a minute away."
1018,"01:09:51,366","01:09:52,565","Marshal Service
is ready for us."
1019,"01:09:52,567","01:09:53,766","Take the statement
at the safe house."
1020,"01:09:53,768","01:09:55,900",No screwing around.
1021,"01:09:55,902","01:09:58,005","- Why is it not stopping?
- I don't know."
1022,"01:10:09,750","01:10:11,984","Sam, I swear,
I had nothing to do with this."
1023,"01:10:11,986","01:10:13,618","- Manny.
- Oh, man, that's not good."
1024,"01:10:13,620","01:10:14,989","Oh, my God."
1025,"01:10:16,624","01:10:20,892","Help me get this open.
It's jammed. Come on."
1026,"01:10:32,607","01:10:35,073","The engineer's dead.
Cab door's jammed."
1027,"01:10:35,075","01:10:37,542","I can't access
the control panel."
1028,"01:10:37,544","01:10:39,412","Dispatch, do you copy?"
1029,"01:10:39,414","01:10:40,913",The brakes have malfunctioned.
1030,"01:10:40,915","01:10:43,084","There's no way
to stop the train."
1031,"01:10:44,419","01:10:45,551",You what?
1032,"01:10:45,553","01:10:47,787","We'll have
to clear the tracks."
1033,"01:10:47,789","01:10:48,953",Roger.
1034,"01:10:48,955","01:10:50,523","Dispatch is gonna
clear the tracks."
1035,"01:10:50,525","01:10:51,457",What?
1036,"01:10:51,459","01:10:54,025","There's a curve
just before Beacon."
1037,"01:10:54,027","01:10:55,828","Now, we hit it
at 70 miles an hour,"
1038,"01:10:55,830","01:10:58,697",we're gonna derail for sure.
1039,"01:10:58,699","01:11:00,699","All the passengers
are in the last car."
1040,"01:11:00,701","01:11:03,905","- Can we detach it?
- We have to try. Come on."
1041,"01:11:06,574","01:11:08,206",We gotta unhook the couplers.
1042,"01:11:08,208","01:11:10,508","There's a coupler
safety latch."
1043,"01:11:10,510","01:11:12,848","It can only be released
from underneath the car."
1044,"01:11:16,115","01:11:18,116","Someone will have to pull
the knuckle pin,"
1045,"01:11:18,118","01:11:21,690","and one of us will have to go
down and release the latch."
1046,"01:11:25,124","01:11:27,025","No. No friggin' way.
I'm not going down there."
1047,"01:11:27,027","01:11:28,092",It's just outside...
1048,"01:11:28,094","01:11:29,595","I don't care. Shut up.
I'm not going down there."
1049,"01:11:29,597","01:11:31,062","Just outside
and down the ladder."
1050,"01:11:31,064","01:11:33,230","- I'll do it.
- Yeah, you do it."
1051,"01:11:33,232","01:11:34,699","Look, you go
tell the passengers"
1052,"01:11:34,701","01:11:36,067",to brace themselves.
1053,"01:11:36,069","01:11:37,069",I'll do that.
1054,"01:11:40,474","01:11:43,073","We got about two minutes.
You make them count."
1055,"01:11:43,075","01:11:45,810","Stay calm.
Stay calm, okay? Stay calm."
1056,"01:11:45,812","01:11:48,145","- Remain calm.
- Why?"
1057,"01:11:48,147","01:11:49,547","I don't have time
to argue with you, lady."
1058,"01:11:49,549","01:11:50,949",Sit down. Take your seats.
1059,"01:11:50,951","01:11:53,821","- Everyone, sit down. Sit down.
- I am sitting down."
1060,"01:12:52,212","01:12:53,548",Yeah!
1061,"01:13:06,561","01:13:08,563",The chain is caught.
1062,"01:13:21,576","01:13:23,645","You need more leverage.
I'll get the ax."
1063,"01:13:37,991","01:13:39,256","Between the train
and the people,"
1064,"01:13:39,258","01:13:41,595","I always knew
it would be the train."
1065,"01:15:24,932","01:15:27,165","All right. I'm okay.
You all right? Come on."
1066,"01:15:27,167","01:15:29,435","- Get that door open.
- Everyone okay?"
1067,"01:15:29,437","01:15:31,970","- We gotta get out.
- Open the door."
1068,"01:15:31,972","01:15:34,338","Stay calm.
Don't get off the train."
1069,"01:15:34,340","01:15:36,040","Please, listen."
1070,"01:15:36,042","01:15:38,163","- Get the door open.
- We gotta get out."
1071,"01:15:41,213","01:15:44,114","Jackson, close the door.
This isn't over yet."
1072,"01:15:44,116","01:15:47,184","We're still in danger.
Everyone grab a newspaper."
1073,"01:15:47,186","01:15:50,456","Cover the windows.
Use water, soda, anything."
1074,"01:15:50,458","01:15:51,856","Mike, this is crazy."
1075,"01:15:51,858","01:15:54,662","Come on, get some water.
Cover the windows."
1076,"01:16:07,474","01:16:09,807","- Why are we doing this, Mike?
- Just do it."
1077,"01:16:09,809","01:16:11,274",We don't know who's out there.
1078,"01:16:11,276","01:16:12,944","Who's watching.
They tried to kill us all."
1079,"01:16:12,946","01:16:14,066","- You all right?
- Yeah."
1080,"01:16:19,284","01:16:22,252","I know you're all scared,
but I need your help."
1081,"01:16:22,254","01:16:24,355","None of you
can leave, not yet."
1082,"01:16:24,357","01:16:27,760","Not until I know
everyone's safe."
1083,"01:16:27,762","01:16:30,895","They murdered innocent people.
They derailed the train."
1084,"01:16:30,897","01:16:33,967","They did this.
All to find a witness."
1085,"01:16:36,437","01:16:38,440","Something she has
that they want."
1086,"01:16:40,907","01:16:42,038","They said
if I didn't kill you,"
1087,"01:16:42,040","01:16:44,207","they would kill
my wife, my son."
1088,"01:16:44,209","01:16:45,143",But I would never.
1089,"01:16:45,145","01:16:47,779","I would never do
what these people want."
1090,"01:16:47,781","01:16:49,381",I need your help.
1091,"01:16:49,383","01:16:51,250","I need to know
why they want you dead."
1092,"01:16:57,458","01:17:00,190","- What's your name?
- Sofia."
1093,"01:17:00,192","01:17:01,729",Sofia.
1094,"01:17:03,163","01:17:05,934",It's okay. Come here.
1095,"01:17:14,441","01:17:17,076","I'm not going to let them
hurt you, okay?"
1096,"01:17:18,177","01:17:19,813","Can you show me
what's in your bag?"
1097,"01:17:33,192","01:17:35,195",This? This is what they want?
1098,"01:17:37,464","01:17:38,831",Do you know why?
1099,"01:17:38,833","01:17:41,198",Because of Enrique.
1100,"01:17:41,200","01:17:42,466",It was his.
1101,"01:17:42,468","01:17:45,436","The guy who threw himself
off the 35th floor?"
1102,"01:17:45,438","01:17:47,840",Ricky didn't kill himself.
1103,"01:17:47,842","01:17:49,344",You were there when he died?
1104,"01:17:53,379","01:17:55,382",It's okay. Tell me.
1105,"01:17:56,983","01:17:58,986",Tell me what you saw.
1106,"01:18:01,856","01:18:04,957","Ricky was a city planner,"
1107,"01:18:04,959","01:18:08,125","and some nights
he would have to work late,"
1108,"01:18:08,127","01:18:12,095","so I would go to his office
to finish my homework."
1109,"01:18:12,097","01:18:14,600","I was waiting
for Ricky by the elevator"
1110,"01:18:14,602","01:18:17,869",when these two men show up.
1111,"01:18:17,871","01:18:20,136","I didn't see their faces,"
1112,"01:18:20,138","01:18:22,141","but they were
looking for Ricky."
1113,"01:18:24,209","01:18:27,347","I hid 'cause I didn't wanna
get him in trouble."
1114,"01:18:29,383","01:18:31,385","But they wanted
something from him."
1115,"01:18:33,085","01:18:37,355","Then all of them
start yelling,"
1116,"01:18:37,357","01:18:39,557",and I hear this noise.
1117,"01:18:39,559","01:18:42,660","They were hurting him.
I could hear him screaming."
1118,"01:18:42,662","01:18:44,529","And he tells them
that he doesn't have it,"
1119,"01:18:44,531","01:18:46,264",that it's back at his place.
1120,"01:18:46,266","01:18:48,566","- You took it.
- Of course I took it."
1121,"01:18:48,568","01:18:51,039",I wanted to help.
1122,"01:18:54,039","01:18:58,542","And then I look through the
doorway and I see this guy."
1123,"01:18:58,544","01:19:01,579","He's holding Ricky,
and he hits him,"
1124,"01:19:01,581","01:19:04,919","and he says something
about being noble."
1125,"01:19:05,518","01:19:06,651",Noble?
1126,"01:19:06,653","01:19:09,020","He says that doing the right
thing will get you killed,"
1127,"01:19:09,022","01:19:12,025","and that there's no such thing
as being noble."
1128,"01:19:12,558","01:19:14,261","And then,"
1129,"01:19:16,030","01:19:17,532",they just...
1130,"01:19:24,338","01:19:26,471",I didn't know what to do.
1131,"01:19:27,607","01:19:28,940",I know.
1132,"01:19:28,942","01:19:31,342",I just took it and I ran.
1133,"01:19:31,344","01:19:33,345","Why didn't you
call the police?"
1134,"01:19:33,347","01:19:34,482",I couldn't call the police.
1135,"01:19:35,950","01:19:38,218","The men
who killed him were cops."
1136,"01:19:40,553","01:19:43,287","Oh, my God."
1137,"01:19:43,289","01:19:46,193","And the next day I just...
I went to a friend's,"
1138,"01:19:47,293","01:19:49,427","and she knew
someone in the FBI."
1139,"01:19:49,429","01:19:51,228","This guy, Agent Garcia,"
1140,"01:19:51,230","01:19:53,465","he says that
this drive is evidence,"
1141,"01:19:53,467","01:19:55,198",and that I'm a witness.
1142,"01:19:55,200","01:19:57,569","He says it's not safe for me
in the city anymore,"
1143,"01:19:57,571","01:19:59,637",tells me to catch the 6:25
1144,"01:19:59,639","01:20:02,109","to Cold Spring,
and they'll protect me."
1145,"01:20:03,509","01:20:06,979","- You told no one else?
- No."
1146,"01:20:06,981","01:20:10,385","Your friend trusts
this Agent Garcia, yeah?"
1147,"01:20:12,084","01:20:13,387",I don't know.
1148,"01:20:15,253","01:20:19,055","Someone out there
wants you to disappear."
1149,"01:20:19,057","01:20:23,129",And if it's not him... Who?
1150,"01:20:37,075","01:20:38,646","Oh, my God."
1151,"01:20:50,758","01:20:52,156","Go, go, go.
Move, move, move."
1152,"01:20:52,158","01:20:53,160",What the hell?
1153,"01:21:09,809","01:21:11,012",MacCauley.
1154,"01:21:15,048","01:21:17,148","This is Captain
David Hawthorne."
1155,"01:21:17,150","01:21:18,417",I'm in command.
1156,"01:21:18,419","01:21:21,421","Entrance clear.
Let's go, go, go, go."
1157,"01:21:23,122","01:21:24,722",We have the train surrounded.
1158,"01:21:24,724","01:21:26,593","There is nowhere
for you to go."
1159,"01:21:30,062","01:21:31,663",Throw out your weapon.
1160,"01:21:31,665","01:21:33,197",My men will come aboard.
1161,"01:21:33,199","01:21:35,600","They will escort
the hostages to safety."
1162,"01:21:35,602","01:21:39,202","- It's okay. Don't be alarmed.
- You will not be harmed."
1163,"01:21:39,204","01:21:40,404","This is
normal police procedure."
1164,"01:21:40,406","01:21:43,341","It's okay.
You will all be safe."
1165,"01:21:43,343","01:21:45,345",No one will be harmed.
1166,"01:22:00,626","01:22:02,629","Jesus, there's
a friggin' army out there."
1167,"01:22:08,602","01:22:11,770","Agent Garcia, come to me."
1168,"01:22:11,772","01:22:14,573","I need tactical staged
and ready to breach, okay?"
1169,"01:22:14,575","01:22:16,510","- Sir.
- Thanks."
1170,"01:22:17,376","01:22:19,379",Where's Overwatch?
1171,"01:22:21,514","01:22:23,648","Overwatch, this is command."
1172,"01:22:23,650","01:22:26,117","When you get line of sight,
I need to know."
1173,"01:22:26,119","01:22:27,318",Roger.
1174,"01:22:27,320","01:22:29,791","- This is bad, Mike.
- It'll be fine, I promise."
1175,"01:22:34,527","01:22:37,662","MacCauley,
you'have an old friend here."
1176,"01:22:37,664","01:22:40,401","He wants to come aboard,
and he wants to talk."
1177,"01:22:49,142","01:22:50,645",Your tag is lit.
1178,"01:23:09,696","01:23:11,429","We are live
outside the town of Beacon,"
1179,"01:23:11,431","01:23:13,664","where a Hudson
North train has derailed."
1180,"01:23:13,666","01:23:15,769","No reports
of any casualties yet."
1181,"01:23:17,704","01:23:18,837",Get back.
1182,"01:23:18,839","01:23:20,372","Go, go, go. Move back."
1183,"01:23:20,374","01:23:21,843","Go, go."
1184,"01:23:24,378","01:23:26,380","We got sound
on Lieutenant Murphy."
1185,"01:23:30,717","01:23:31,749","According to
our source on the ground,"
1186,"01:23:31,751","01:23:34,852","an ex-NYPD officer
has taken over the train"
1187,"01:23:34,854","01:23:37,324","and is holding
the passengers hostage."
1188,"01:23:42,328","01:23:43,609","Hey, Mike,
how we doing in there?"
1189,"01:23:44,731","01:23:46,063","Listen, man,
you know how this goes."
1190,"01:23:46,065","01:23:48,466","We don't work this out, SWAT's
gonna take the train by force."
1191,"01:23:51,470","01:23:52,606","Come on, talk to me, buddy."
1192,"01:23:56,476","01:23:57,742",Where's my family?
1193,"01:23:57,744","01:23:59,010","You said police
were on their way."
1194,"01:23:59,012","01:24:00,945","They were, man.
I don't know what happened."
1195,"01:24:00,947","01:24:03,547","Look, we're doing
the best we can."
1196,"01:24:03,549","01:24:05,449","You don't know
what's going on, Murph."
1197,"01:24:05,451","01:24:07,418","Then tell me, all right?"
1198,"01:24:07,420","01:24:10,357","Just open the door, let me in.
I'm unarmed. I'm alone."
1199,"01:24:18,330","01:24:19,611","How many people
you got in there?"
1200,"01:24:22,436","01:24:24,300","Mike, I wanna help you.
You gotta help me out."
1201,"01:24:24,302","01:24:26,837","If I don't produce results,
they're gonna pull me out."
1202,"01:24:26,839","01:24:29,507","Now, how many
hostages do you have?"
1203,"01:24:29,509","01:24:31,376",We gotta do something.
1204,"01:24:31,378","01:24:32,914","Yeah, but what?
What can we do?"
1205,"01:24:34,348","01:24:36,381","Fifteen, 20."
1206,"01:24:36,383","01:24:39,016","All right, just let some go.
Whoever you want."
1207,"01:24:39,018","01:24:40,720",How do I know they'll be safe?
1208,"01:24:42,388","01:24:44,255",The hostages?
1209,"01:24:44,257","01:24:46,891","There's someone
I need to protect."
1210,"01:24:46,893","01:24:48,726","Look, if you're worried
about someone's safety,"
1211,"01:24:48,728","01:24:49,896",just send them out with me.
1212,"01:24:52,265","01:24:54,265",Not yet.
1213,"01:24:54,267","01:24:55,636",No...
1214,"01:24:58,371","01:25:01,405","Seven years we were partners.
You always had my back."
1215,"01:25:01,407","01:25:03,410","Let someone else
have yours for once."
1216,"01:25:06,812","01:25:07,815",Mike.
1217,"01:25:09,750","01:25:12,282","Look, I tell you what.
I'll make an exchange, okay?"
1218,"01:25:12,284","01:25:15,355","Release some hostages
and take me instead."
1219,"01:25:32,638","01:25:33,718",They're coming out.
1220,"01:25:34,907","01:25:37,676","Come on out.
Come on out."
1221,"01:25:37,678","01:25:39,042","Come on.
Come on. This way."
1222,"01:25:39,044","01:25:41,312","Watch your step.
Go that way. Follow her."
1223,"01:25:41,314","01:25:42,614","All right, stay in line."
1224,"01:25:42,616","01:25:45,850","Yes, it does appear
that hostages are being released."
1225,"01:25:45,852","01:25:49,423","It is unclear at this time
how many remain on the train."
1226,"01:25:56,562","01:25:58,833","- Is that it?
- Yeah. Come on."
1227,"01:26:02,501","01:26:04,601","All right. Patrol's on
their way to your house."
1228,"01:26:04,603","01:26:05,873",No sirens.
1229,"01:26:11,777","01:26:13,944",They have you tagged.
1230,"01:26:13,946","01:26:16,113","This goes on much longer,
they're gonna board."
1231,"01:26:16,115","01:26:17,916","They don't want a cop
caught in the crossfire."
1232,"01:26:19,018","01:26:21,085","Come on, put the gun down."
1233,"01:26:21,087","01:26:22,990","Jesus, I'm unarmed. Come on."
1234,"01:26:31,431","01:26:33,731","Tell them
to turn the lights off."
1235,"01:26:33,733","01:26:35,736",Kill the lights.
1236,"01:26:36,370","01:26:37,405",Cut the lights.
1237,"01:26:41,140","01:26:43,641","- Thanks, pal.
- Come on, you know the deal."
1238,"01:26:43,643","01:26:45,843",We lost audio.
1239,"01:26:45,845","01:26:48,579","You were right, there is
a witness on the train."
1240,"01:26:48,581","01:26:50,815","They were supposed to meet
the FBI at Cold Spring."
1241,"01:26:50,817","01:26:54,551","- FBI? Special Agent Garcia?
- You know?"
1242,"01:26:54,553","01:26:56,421","Hawthorne just pulled
jurisdiction from him."
1243,"01:26:56,423","01:26:58,122",Hawthorne. That figures.
1244,"01:26:58,124","01:27:01,392","I want eyes on.
Confirm visuals."
1245,"01:27:02,495","01:27:04,895","Friendly fire tag
is lit in blue."
1246,"01:27:04,897","01:27:06,162",Visual confirmed.
1247,"01:27:06,164","01:27:08,499","Mike, what the hell happened?"
1248,"01:27:08,501","01:27:09,534","I talk to you,"
1249,"01:27:09,536","01:27:11,472","next thing I know
you're taking people hostage."
1250,"01:27:12,671","01:27:14,471","They killed three passengers,
including a fed."
1251,"01:27:14,473","01:27:16,408",They derailed the train.
1252,"01:27:16,410","01:27:18,646","- All to get some evidence.
- Okay."
1253,"01:27:19,845","01:27:21,011","So where is it, Mike?"
1254,"01:27:21,013","01:27:22,646","Not until Karen
and Danny are safe."
1255,"01:27:22,648","01:27:24,783","Local PD's
calling me directly."
1256,"01:27:24,785","01:27:26,119","So, we wait."
1257,"01:27:28,921","01:27:30,624",We wait.
1258,"01:27:31,791","01:27:33,058",Yeah.
1259,"01:27:36,028","01:27:37,462",How you guys doing?
1260,"01:27:37,464","01:27:38,630","- Yeah, I'm good.
- Not too bad."
1261,"01:27:38,632","01:27:41,369","- Oh, perfect.
- Fine, but I gotta pee."
1262,"01:27:43,836","01:27:45,737","Mike, I know
this isn't you, man."
1263,"01:27:45,739","01:27:50,841","Look, you say they set you up,
you got a witness, evidence."
1264,"01:27:50,843","01:27:53,176","- I believe you, but...
- But what?"
1265,"01:27:53,178","01:27:54,913","It doesn't matter
what I believe."
1266,"01:27:54,915","01:27:57,481",It's what I can prove.
1267,"01:27:57,483","01:27:59,716","Look, you want confirmation
on your family. I understand."
1268,"01:27:59,718","01:28:00,851","But from where I sit,"
1269,"01:28:00,853","01:28:02,185","I say we end
this thing right now."
1270,"01:28:02,187","01:28:05,055","Just give me what you got,
nobody else has to get hurt."
1271,"01:28:05,057","01:28:09,526","You telling me that
as a detective or a friend?"
1272,"01:28:09,528","01:28:11,628","I don't know, Mike.
What would you tell me?"
1273,"01:28:14,668","01:28:16,737","We're running
out of time, man."
1274,"01:28:18,772","01:28:21,773","Mike, I get it. You wanna
do the noble thing here."
1275,"01:28:21,775","01:28:22,673",But I got news for you.
1276,"01:28:22,675","01:28:24,035","There ain't
no such thing as noble."
1277,"01:28:33,753","01:28:35,752","- It was you.
- What are you talking about?"
1278,"01:28:35,754","01:28:38,558","You called me. You knew
about the witness. You..."
1279,"01:28:40,092","01:28:41,559",You knew what they saw.
1280,"01:28:41,561","01:28:43,660","Yeah, I told you
what happened."
1281,"01:28:43,662","01:28:45,097",It was a cop who killed him.
1282,"01:28:46,633","01:28:49,166","- You set me up.
- Hey, slow down, Mike."
1283,"01:28:49,168","01:28:51,935",You killed Enrique Mendez.
1284,"01:28:51,937","01:28:53,770","You knew Prynne was
getting on this train."
1285,"01:28:53,772","01:28:55,840","- You targeted me.
- Mike..."
1286,"01:28:55,842","01:28:59,610","An ex-cop rides this train every day.
You knew."
1287,"01:28:59,612","01:29:01,011","Mike, whoever's talking to you,
they're trying to get in your..."
1288,"01:29:01,013","01:29:02,144",Son of a...
1289,"01:29:02,146","01:29:04,548","You've lost it, man."
1290,"01:29:04,550","01:29:06,583","Talk, God damn it. Talk!"
1291,"01:29:06,585","01:29:07,851","Friendly's
engaged with the target."
1292,"01:29:07,853","01:29:09,988","I repeat, friendly's
engaged with the target."
1293,"01:29:09,990","01:29:12,590","Do not fire
until you get a clear shot."
1294,"01:29:12,592","01:29:14,224",And say what?
1295,"01:29:14,226","01:29:16,927","That you killed
three people, a fed?"
1296,"01:29:16,929","01:29:19,162","You derailed a train and took
the passengers hostage,"
1297,"01:29:19,164","01:29:22,198","all 'cause some mystery woman
threatened your family?"
1298,"01:29:22,200","01:29:23,767",You did this.
1299,"01:29:23,769","01:29:25,636","Doesn't look
that way, does it?"
1300,"01:29:25,638","01:29:27,971","So why don't you
put down the gun"
1301,"01:29:27,973","01:29:29,940","before someone
you love gets hurt?"
1302,"01:29:29,942","01:29:32,579","Where are they?
Where's my family?"
1303,"01:29:35,714","01:29:37,849","I will kill you, Murph.
I swear to God."
1304,"01:29:37,851","01:29:41,050","Okay, okay, okay.
I'm trying to help you here."
1305,"01:29:41,052","01:29:42,953","A lot of powerful people
have got a lot to lose"
1306,"01:29:42,955","01:29:44,287",if that evidence gets out.
1307,"01:29:44,289","01:29:47,224","They have eyes everywhere,
even inside the Bureau."
1308,"01:29:47,226","01:29:49,126","I told them to put the
witness on your train."
1309,"01:29:49,128","01:29:50,293","I thought I was
doing you a favor."
1310,"01:29:50,295","01:29:51,462",You needed the money.
1311,"01:29:51,464","01:29:54,297","But you couldn't just do
what she asked, could you?"
1312,"01:29:59,673","01:30:02,710","If I don't answer that,
your family dies."
1313,"01:30:05,010","01:30:06,546","So why don't you
give me the gun?"
1314,"01:30:07,947","01:30:09,717","You got no choice, Mike."
1315,"01:30:12,352","01:30:14,050","It doesn't have to
end this way."
1316,"01:30:15,688","01:30:18,021","Come on. Karen, Danny..."
1317,"01:30:18,023","01:30:19,692","Don't you dare
say their names."
1318,"01:30:23,028","01:30:25,095","You've done enough, Mike."
1319,"01:30:33,906","01:30:35,606","- Is it done?
- We're good."
1320,"01:30:35,608","01:30:36,610",You know what to do.
1321,"01:30:41,146","01:30:46,049","See, the thing is, Mike...
I got a family, too, you know."
1322,"01:30:46,051","01:30:47,854","All right, who's Prynne?"
1323,"01:30:50,723","01:30:51,956","Murph, listen to me."
1324,"01:30:51,958","01:30:53,438","All I gotta do
is call her back, Mike."
1325,"01:30:58,129","01:30:59,967",Come on.
1326,"01:31:04,136","01:31:06,039","All right, who's Prynne?"
1327,"01:31:09,141","01:31:10,844",Who's Prynne?
1328,"01:31:13,412","01:31:16,016","Mike, who's Prynne?"
1329,"01:31:19,718","01:31:21,219",Who's Prynne?
1330,"01:31:25,289","01:31:27,594",It's me.
1331,"01:31:33,164","01:31:34,802",I'm Prynne.
1332,"01:31:38,705","01:31:41,008","No, man.
She's covering for me."
1333,"01:31:43,042","01:31:45,277","- I am Prynne.
- Wait."
1334,"01:31:48,714","01:31:51,748",I'm the witness. I'm Prynne.
1335,"01:31:51,750","01:31:54,317",No. I'm Prynne.
1336,"01:31:54,319","01:31:56,887","They're lying. I'm Prynne,"
1337,"01:31:56,889","01:31:58,625","and I know what you did,
you bastard."
1338,"01:32:00,325","01:32:02,763","I am not Prynne, so..."
1339,"01:32:05,732","01:32:07,832","- No one is.
- It's gotta be someone."
1340,"01:32:12,472","01:32:14,340","- You get a shot, take him out.
- Roger."
1341,"01:32:27,486","01:32:29,086",Leave it.
1342,"01:33:10,897","01:33:12,328",Murph.
1343,"01:33:17,235","01:33:21,239","Overwatch, do you have a shot?
Repeat, do you have a shot?"
1344,"01:33:22,207","01:33:23,305",Negative.
1345,"01:33:23,307","01:33:25,041",Watch the hostages.
1346,"01:33:25,043","01:33:26,511","- Watch the friendly.
- Holding fire."
1347,"01:33:26,513","01:33:28,245","What are you gonna do,
kill all of us?"
1348,"01:33:28,247","01:33:29,950","No, you are."
1349,"01:33:31,985","01:33:33,119",Target is clear.
1350,"01:33:34,319","01:33:35,755",Take him out.
1351,"01:33:47,866","01:33:49,533","- No gun.
- Get down!"
1352,"01:33:49,535","01:33:52,470","Do not move!
Stay down!"
1353,"01:33:52,472","01:33:53,871","- Do not move!
- Against the wall!"
1354,"01:33:53,873","01:33:56,009",Get down! Get down!
1355,"01:33:58,577","01:34:01,813","- All the way down!
- Stop! Stop! Stop!"
1356,"01:34:01,815","01:34:02,849",He saved me!
1357,"01:34:03,916","01:34:06,284","- He saved me.
- Prynne?"
1358,"01:34:17,964","01:34:21,131",MacCauley? Michael MacCauley?
1359,"01:34:21,133","01:34:22,899",Yeah.
1360,"01:34:22,901","01:34:26,436","I'm Agent Garcia, FBI.
Your family's safe."
1361,"01:34:26,438","01:34:28,875","We arrested three men
outside your home."
1362,"01:34:44,256","01:34:46,591",He was your cousin?
1363,"01:34:46,593","01:34:49,028",Tell me what you saw.
1364,"01:34:50,128","01:34:51,996","- Thanks.
- Okay."
1365,"01:34:51,998","01:34:54,000","This way.
Watch your step."
1366,"01:34:57,903","01:34:59,236","So this is
the end of the line."
1367,"01:34:59,238","01:35:00,872",I guess so.
1368,"01:35:00,874","01:35:03,975","Next time
I'm taking the bus."
1369,"01:35:03,977","01:35:06,610","All I know is this, all right?
That guy is a goddamn hero."
1370,"01:35:06,612","01:35:09,144","- Okay? A hero. Write that down.
- Yeah."
1371,"01:35:09,146","01:35:10,449",H-E-R-O. Hero.
1372,"01:35:11,384","01:35:13,583",A hero. Did you write it?
1373,"01:35:13,585","01:35:15,953","- ""Hero.""
- Thank you."
1374,"01:35:20,660","01:35:22,894","So, what's up?
You got a boyfriend or what?"
1375,"01:35:22,896","01:35:25,295",What?
1376,"01:35:25,297","01:35:27,465","- Yeah.
- Yeah? Is it serious?"
1377,"01:35:27,467","01:35:29,566","I wanna know what I'm dealing
with, you know what I mean?"
1378,"01:35:29,568","01:35:32,470","- Hi, darling.
- Hey, babe."
1379,"01:35:32,472","01:35:34,471","Oh, my God. Look at you.
Are you okay?"
1380,"01:35:34,473","01:35:37,608","- I'm all right. Hey, big guy.
- Hey, Dad."
1381,"01:35:37,610","01:35:38,978",How you doing?
1382,"01:35:40,013","01:35:41,578","Oh, Mrs. MacCauley,"
1383,"01:35:41,580","01:35:44,517","I believe
you may have lost this."
1384,"01:35:45,951","01:35:47,584","I've been looking
for this all day."
1385,"01:35:47,586","01:35:51,187","- Shall we get you home?
- Yeah, let's go home."
1386,"01:35:51,189","01:35:52,957","So, this is
what you do every day"
1387,"01:35:52,959","01:35:54,224","when you go to work, huh?"
1388,"01:35:54,226","01:35:56,627","Yeah, every day."
1389,"01:35:56,629","01:35:58,632","Come on, help me up. Ooh."
1390,"01:36:01,601","01:36:04,034","I can't believe
what they're saying."
1391,"01:36:04,036","01:36:06,572",Is it really true about Murph?
1392,"01:36:08,674","01:36:11,878","Give me a second, will you?
Give me a second."
1393,"01:36:17,482","01:36:18,783",David.
1394,"01:36:18,785","01:36:22,217","I have to tell you, there's
been an ongoing investigation"
1395,"01:36:22,219","01:36:25,087","into Alex Murphy
and others in the department."
1396,"01:36:25,089","01:36:28,093","- There was a woman.
- Female, mid-30s."
1397,"01:36:28,727","01:36:30,159",We're checking CCTV
1398,"01:36:30,161","01:36:31,962","in and around
86th Street, right?"
1399,"01:36:31,964","01:36:35,234","- Yeah.
- When we know, you'll know."
1400,"01:36:37,736","01:36:41,106","What can I say?
I'm sorry it got this far."
1401,"01:36:44,610","01:36:47,410","Listen, uh, Mike..."
1402,"01:36:47,412","01:36:50,581","We miss guys like you
in the department."
1403,"01:36:50,583","01:36:52,585",Guys that do it right.
1404,"01:36:58,558","01:37:00,358",More details are emerging now
1405,"01:37:00,360","01:37:01,993","in the wake of that
Hudson North derailment..."
1406,"01:37:01,995","01:37:05,327","A federal witness reportedly
turned over evidence to authorities..."
1407,"01:37:05,329","01:37:08,131","Several NYPD
officers have been implicated."

a city planning official."

blow the whistle on a conspiracy."

City Hall, to the Mayor's office..."

accusations of collusion..."
1413,"01:37:17,544","01:37:20,143","And now a link between
city officials and at least..."
1414,"01:37:20,145","01:37:23,014","...corruption on a major
scale, and this mystery woman"
1415,"01:37:23,016","01:37:24,582","who masterminded
the derailment,"
1416,"01:37:24,584","01:37:26,586",does she even exist?

a few years back."
1421,"01:37:50,543","01:37:51,775",It's got a hell of an ending.
1422,"01:37:51,777","01:37:54,144",This seat taken?
1423,"01:37:54,146","01:37:58,081","The 6:20 every morning

1424,"01:37:58,083","01:38:01,452","You know, I never took you
for a commuter."
1425,"01:38:01,454","01:38:03,185",I'm sorry. Have we met?
1426,"01:38:03,187","01:38:06,055","The way I figure it,
the people you work for,"
1427,"01:38:06,057","01:38:09,659","Alex Murphy goes down,
you win."
1428,"01:38:09,661","01:38:13,400","That 16-year-old girl
dies on that train, you win."

1430,"01:38:16,200","01:38:19,005","the rest of us
just collateral damage."
1431,"01:38:21,607","01:38:24,273","You didn't pick me because
the witness was on my train."
1432,"01:38:24,275","01:38:26,743",You put her on the train.
1433,"01:38:27,847","01:38:30,648",Maybe you even got me fired.
1434,"01:38:30,650","01:38:32,682","Suddenly I have motive,
opportunity,"
1435,"01:38:32,684","01:38:34,685",just like Alex Murphy.
1436,"01:38:34,687","01:38:38,492","This wasn't his operation.
You played us both."
