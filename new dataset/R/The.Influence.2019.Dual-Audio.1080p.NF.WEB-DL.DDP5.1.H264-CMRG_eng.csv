2,"00:02:17,375","00:02:18,542",How cool!
3,"00:02:31,167","00:02:33,542","-Gotcha!
-Nora, come here."
4,"00:02:33,708","00:02:34,792",Nora!
5,"00:02:42,167","00:02:43,583","Nora, keep still!"
6,"00:02:50,708","00:02:52,042","Hello, Sara."
7,"00:02:53,583","00:02:54,583",Hello.
8,"00:02:58,458","00:03:00,833","-Have you met my daughter Nora?
-Hello."
9,"00:03:02,042","00:03:03,792","-And my husband Mikel.
-Hi, Mikel."
10,"00:03:03,958","00:03:05,333",Nice to meet you.
11,"00:03:05,500","00:03:07,958","Well, come in.
Make yourselves at home."
12,"00:03:08,125","00:03:08,833",Thanks.
13,"00:03:09,125","00:03:11,667","Sweetie, help me,
grab that suitcase over there."
14,"00:03:16,583","00:03:18,500",I think I told you on the phone.
15,"00:03:19,583","00:03:22,875",The nurse only works for six hours.
16,"00:03:23,000","00:03:26,667","-And why's that?
-It's all the insurance would cover."
17,"00:03:27,667","00:03:31,500","So we're going to have
to take it in turns caring for her."
18,"00:03:31,667","00:03:35,208","-When do you start at the hospital?
-Tomorrow."
19,"00:03:45,292","00:03:47,208",Doesn't anyone come to clean?
20,"00:03:47,375","00:03:51,208","Mum got rid of everyone,
she couldn't stand any of them."
21,"00:04:27,333","00:04:28,667",Don't be scared.
22,"00:05:15,458","00:05:16,583",Hello.
23,"00:05:18,583","00:05:19,667",I'm Anna.
24,"00:05:20,708","00:05:24,792","I changed her catheter.
Your sister said you're a nurse."
25,"00:05:25,458","00:05:26,667",Yes.
26,"00:05:29,042","00:05:32,708","She has ulcers in her kidneys
and on her back."
27,"00:05:34,458","00:05:37,083","-You know what to do, right?
-Yes, of course."
28,"00:05:37,875","00:05:40,000","Very good.
Well, I'll be back tomorrow."
29,"00:05:40,167","00:05:41,042","Thanks, Anna."
30,"00:06:04,375","00:06:06,292",Are you going to die like Daddy?
31,"00:06:11,667","00:06:15,292","That's what you'd like, right?
You little pig."
32,"00:06:29,375","00:06:31,250","She should be in a hospital,"
33,"00:06:32,292","00:06:34,375",this place isn't suitable.
34,"00:06:34,667","00:06:38,042","She explicitly asked
not to be moved from here."
35,"00:06:38,208","00:06:40,375","It's a living will, so we can't..."
36,"00:06:40,542","00:06:42,500",There's nothing we can do.
37,"00:06:43,083","00:06:45,833","The notary made himself
extremely clear on the matter."
38,"00:06:45,958","00:06:48,333","We'll have to move
these books from here."
39,"00:06:49,625","00:06:53,333","When Mum wakes up, she'll want to find
everything just as she left it."
40,"00:06:53,500","00:06:55,458","Victoria isn't going to wake up, Sara."
41,"00:07:01,958","00:07:03,458",Where are her things?
42,"00:07:05,375","00:07:08,042","-No, not that wardrobe.
-The key?"
43,"00:07:08,208","00:07:12,083","I don't know where the key is.
Mum kept it safe."
44,"00:07:13,583","00:07:15,375",Her things are in that wardrobe.
45,"00:07:32,958","00:07:36,333","-Mummy.
-What is it?"
46,"00:07:36,500","00:07:38,250",When can I see grandma?
47,"00:07:39,875","00:07:43,417","-Grandma is very sick, darling.
-I don't mind."
48,"00:08:02,125","00:08:04,417","You could have visited,"
49,"00:08:05,083","00:08:07,583","even if it was just once,
in all this time."
50,"00:08:09,167","00:08:11,958","I promised myself I'd never come back.
I'm here for you."
51,"00:08:13,167","00:08:14,625",Certainly not for her.
52,"00:08:15,708","00:08:17,792","You called me and I came, to help you."
53,"00:08:18,542","00:08:21,583","And because I found a job,
or I wouldn't have been able to come."
54,"00:08:23,000","00:08:24,167",Thank you.
55,"00:08:26,833","00:08:29,083","Nora will be fine at school, you'll see."
56,"00:08:32,583","00:08:35,917","-Where do you live?
-I've rented a cottage."
57,"00:08:37,000","00:08:40,000","It's small,
but... it's got a lovely garden."
58,"00:08:40,167","00:08:41,208",And...
59,"00:08:42,250","00:08:45,125","-Have you met anyone in all this time?
-No."
60,"00:08:45,958","00:08:47,000",And Félix?
61,"00:08:47,500","00:08:48,875",Félix?
62,"00:08:49,000","00:08:50,792",Félix left a long time ago.
63,"00:08:51,500","00:08:53,250",He's married with three kids.
64,"00:08:54,375","00:08:57,208","Anyway, Mum didn't like Félix at all."
65,"00:08:57,458","00:08:59,958",Victoria didn't like anyone.
66,"00:09:03,417","00:09:05,000",How long has she been like that?
67,"00:09:05,167","00:09:09,042","In a coma, one month,
ever since I called you."
68,"00:09:11,000","00:09:14,250","Shut away in that room, three years."
69,"00:09:15,708","00:09:17,917",The last few months were horrible.
70,"00:09:20,125","00:09:22,542",She just talked about death.
71,"00:09:24,958","00:09:27,208",She cried and moaned all the time...
72,"00:09:29,042","00:09:32,167","and rang that damned bell
like a madwoman."
73,"00:09:40,167","00:09:41,417","Until one day,"
74,"00:09:42,500","00:09:44,292",she suddenly stopped shouting.
75,"00:09:50,958","00:09:52,458","I went up to her room,"
76,"00:09:54,375","00:09:56,083",I thought she was dead.
77,"00:10:02,708","00:10:07,458","You know? That tooth stopped hurting me
as soon as she went into a coma."
78,"00:10:10,458","00:10:13,583","But, even still, I feel as though..."
79,"00:10:15,333","00:10:16,708",she's watching me.
80,"00:10:18,375","00:10:20,375","She's watching me from the corners,"
81,"00:10:20,708","00:10:22,458",like when we were little.
82,"00:10:44,458","00:10:47,250","-Will you be long?
-No, I'm coming."
83,"00:13:04,625","00:13:06,333","Nora, are you there?"
84,"00:15:09,625","00:15:10,792",Nora.
85,"00:15:12,542","00:15:13,792",Get back upstairs.
86,"00:15:14,958","00:15:18,208","-Daddy, I found this.
-What is it?"
87,"00:15:18,958","00:15:20,042",I don't know.
88,"00:15:21,875","00:15:24,542","-Can I keep it?
-I guess. Ask your mother, go on."
89,"00:15:43,167","00:15:44,625",Have a good day.
90,"00:17:29,917","00:17:33,208","Kids, I've got a surprise for you."
91,"00:17:34,042","00:17:37,500","Let me introduce your new classmate:
Nora Fernández."
92,"00:17:37,667","00:17:39,292",She's just arrived here.
93,"00:17:39,458","00:17:42,375","I hope you'll all help her
with anything she needs."
94,"00:17:44,000","00:17:47,667","You can sit there, next to Beatriz.
She'll help you."
95,"00:17:47,875","00:17:49,042","Right, Bea?"
96,"00:17:49,708","00:17:53,167","Very good.
Now, take out your maths books."
97,"00:17:54,208","00:17:57,958","I marked your exams yesterday
and half of them were terrible."
98,"00:19:07,542","00:19:08,833","Hello, Victoria."
99,"00:19:09,500","00:19:11,875","My name's Mikel, I'm your son-in-law."
100,"00:19:13,583","00:19:15,875","I've seen what you're storing
in that room."
101,"00:19:16,708","00:19:19,417","They already told me
you're a scumbag witch."
102,"00:19:21,708","00:19:23,333",And it turns out it's true.
103,"00:19:31,458","00:19:32,583",Fuck me!
104,"00:19:39,625","00:19:40,667",Hello?
105,"00:19:41,917","00:19:43,958","-Hello.
-Hello."
106,"00:19:44,458","00:19:48,250","-I'm Mikel, Alicia's husband.
-I'm Anna, the nurse."
107,"00:19:48,417","00:19:51,250","-Nice to meet you.
-I thought no one was here."
108,"00:19:51,917","00:19:53,250","Well, I was..."
109,"00:19:54,917","00:19:57,333","-With the mistress?
-Yes."
110,"00:19:57,500","00:20:01,167","Yes, and... she opened an eye."
111,"00:20:01,958","00:20:04,708","That's normal, it's a nervous tic."
112,"00:20:04,917","00:20:07,000","-I'm going up.
-Yes, of course."
113,"00:20:07,167","00:20:09,167","-I have to go out.
-Very well."
114,"00:20:09,333","00:20:10,958","-Excuse me.
-Yes?"
115,"00:20:11,083","00:20:13,208",Is there an electrician in the village?
116,"00:20:13,375","00:20:17,125","Of course, Mr Cotarelo.
He's got a shop in the centre."
117,"00:20:57,958","00:21:00,458","That doesn't look like
it's going to work."
118,"00:21:02,333","00:21:06,167","-Do you want to bet?
-Go on then, a beer."
119,"00:21:07,083","00:21:09,208",Let's go higher. Two.
120,"00:21:10,375","00:21:14,292","You'll love this. Three, two, one..."
121,"00:21:18,250","00:21:20,500","I'm suddenly feeling really thirsty?
Aren't you?"
122,"00:21:21,542","00:21:24,333","-Have you changed her nappy?
-Whose?"
123,"00:21:26,583","00:21:28,375",I didn't know I had to do that.
124,"00:21:29,625","00:21:32,333","-Of course not, man.
-You're hilarious."
125,"00:21:33,375","00:21:35,042",Have you seen what's in there?
126,"00:21:35,667","00:21:36,792",Come on.
127,"00:21:40,500","00:21:41,708",Come on.
128,"00:21:47,708","00:21:49,542",We should throw all this crap out.
129,"00:21:50,917","00:21:53,625","I don't know what to say,
I'd sell it on the Internet."
130,"00:21:54,667","00:21:58,375","I'm sure some nutcase
would pay a fortune for all this."
131,"00:22:07,583","00:22:08,708",I love you.
132,"00:22:19,417","00:22:21,542","Darling,
I've been looking for work and..."
133,"00:22:23,708","00:22:26,083","it's not going to be easy
to find something in my field."
134,"00:22:26,458","00:22:28,667","I even left a CV at the school,"
135,"00:22:28,875","00:22:31,250","but I don't think
they need electricians."
136,"00:22:32,083","00:22:33,583","So, I was thinking..."
137,"00:22:34,625","00:22:37,958","perhaps at the port
or working on a boat, I don't know."
138,"00:22:47,458","00:22:48,875",Are you listening to me?
139,"00:22:50,042","00:22:51,167",Are you alright?
140,"00:22:51,958","00:22:53,083",Yes.
141,"00:22:54,542","00:22:55,958",What's that?
142,"00:22:58,958","00:23:02,583","Fuck! Are you sure
that woman is your mother?"
143,"00:23:09,875","00:23:12,750","Coinciding with
the arrival of your sister and..."
144,"00:23:12,917","00:23:15,958","following your mother's
precise instructions,"
145,"00:23:16,125","00:23:19,167","I've invited your uncle
Pedro Álvarez and his son Fran..."
146,"00:23:19,333","00:23:20,375","Nora, go to your room."
147,"00:23:20,458","00:23:24,542","...for the advance reading
of Mrs Álvarez's will."
148,"00:23:27,458","00:23:29,958","Don't you think
she should be in a hospital?"
149,"00:23:30,542","00:23:32,708",This is clearly not the best place.
150,"00:23:33,667","00:23:34,708",No.
151,"00:23:35,333","00:23:37,458",According to the medical reports.
152,"00:23:37,625","00:23:42,750","But in this case, and until clinical death
has been confirmed,"
153,"00:23:43,083","00:23:46,083","we must abide by
the express wishes of your mother"
154,"00:23:46,250","00:23:48,625","concerning the treatment
and care of her person."
155,"00:23:48,792","00:23:51,250","I have to open the shop,
could you hurry up, please?"
156,"00:23:54,083","00:23:55,208",How old is your daughter?
157,"00:23:56,167","00:23:58,083","She's ten, almost eleven."
158,"00:23:58,708","00:23:59,792",Why do you ask?
159,"00:24:05,875","00:24:08,583","Your daughter, Nora Fernández,"
160,"00:24:10,208","00:24:12,667","will be the universal heir
of all your mother's assets."
161,"00:24:23,708","00:24:26,875","As is usual in these cases,
until she reaches the age of majority,"
162,"00:24:27,708","00:24:30,625","you will be responsible
for the administration of her assets."
163,"00:24:30,792","00:24:34,917","All of which, from meeting her,
having observed the single act..."
164,"00:24:46,125","00:24:47,500",There must be some mistake.
165,"00:24:48,500","00:24:50,375","I don't understand.
No, it can't be..."
166,"00:24:55,667","00:24:56,583",Good day.
167,"00:25:37,167","00:25:38,750","What do you want, grandma?"
168,"00:25:39,667","00:25:41,458",Why did you call me?
169,"00:25:44,000","00:25:47,958",This room... just for me?
170,"00:25:49,250","00:25:51,000",Of course I'd like it.
171,"00:25:56,458","00:25:57,542",What are you doing here?
172,"00:26:01,542","00:26:04,333","Darling, I know you really want
to be with your grandma,"
173,"00:26:04,708","00:26:06,208",but you have to wait a while.
174,"00:26:06,375","00:26:10,083","You have to let her rest,
so she can get better, OK?"
175,"00:26:10,583","00:26:11,792","Come on, let's go."
176,"00:26:12,792","00:26:16,458","-Why is Uncle Fran missing a finger?
-Uncle Fran is missing a finger?"
177,"00:26:16,625","00:26:18,958","I didn't notice,
he must have had an accident."
178,"00:26:51,667","00:26:52,583",But...
179,"00:26:53,208","00:26:55,458",She never even met her.
180,"00:26:56,500","00:26:59,083","She never even showed
any interest in the girl..."
181,"00:26:59,250","00:27:00,458","Calm down, Sara."
182,"00:27:00,708","00:27:03,375","Darling, darling,"
183,"00:27:03,875","00:27:05,000",is everything alright?
184,"00:27:05,458","00:27:06,667","Yes, everything's fine."
185,"00:27:07,042","00:27:08,500",We'll be outside.
186,"00:27:10,458","00:27:12,792","Perhaps it's her way
of reconciling with Alicia."
187,"00:27:12,958","00:27:14,958",She should have tried that before.
188,"00:27:15,458","00:27:17,208",And in a different way.
189,"00:27:17,708","00:27:19,583",We all know what Vicky was like.
190,"00:27:20,417","00:27:22,875",Your father's death deeply affected her.
191,"00:27:23,375","00:27:26,875","And then... she became obsessed
with those things."
192,"00:27:27,875","00:27:29,292",She was very lonely.
193,"00:27:29,458","00:27:33,625","But I refuse to believe she was evil
and the will is proof of that."
194,"00:27:33,792","00:27:35,625",How can you say that?
195,"00:27:35,792","00:27:38,292",How can you be so hypocritical?
196,"00:27:39,000","00:27:40,875",You knew everything.
197,"00:27:41,042","00:27:44,833","You knew about everything she did to us
and you never did anything."
198,"00:27:45,375","00:27:48,042",You allowed all that madness.
199,"00:27:49,208","00:27:51,125",Don't talk about your mother like that.
200,"00:27:51,292","00:27:52,792",She has her reasons to say that.
201,"00:27:53,792","00:27:55,458",We all do.
202,"00:27:55,625","00:27:56,750",Ask your son.
203,"00:27:56,917","00:27:57,958",Shut up!
204,"00:28:00,125","00:28:01,917",Don't involve your cousin in this.
205,"00:28:02,083","00:28:03,750","He can speak, he has a mouth."
206,"00:28:04,375","00:28:06,042",Why don't you ask him?
207,"00:28:06,875","00:28:07,875",Why don't you speak?
208,"00:28:09,042","00:28:11,917","Why don't you tell your father
what Victoria did to you?"
209,"00:28:12,083","00:28:13,083",Speak!
210,"00:28:16,667","00:28:19,750","I understand you're going through
a rough patch financially."
211,"00:28:20,208","00:28:22,958","If the last will of your mother
can help you out,"
212,"00:28:23,125","00:28:25,375",you should be grateful to her.
213,"00:28:25,833","00:28:27,083",Don't you think?
214,"00:28:27,375","00:28:28,375",What?
215,"00:28:31,875","00:28:32,917",And me?
216,"00:28:43,708","00:28:45,500","Sara, Sara!"
217,"00:28:51,583","00:28:52,708",Sorry.
218,"00:29:18,208","00:29:19,542",Is it still hurting you?
219,"00:29:27,125","00:29:28,500","I got a call from the port,"
220,"00:29:30,292","00:29:32,375",they need people to unload fish.
221,"00:29:32,542","00:29:35,125","Are you sure
that's what you want to do?"
222,"00:29:37,208","00:29:39,875","The stink of fish isn't great,
but what can I do?"
223,"00:29:40,542","00:29:42,625",I can't stay here all day doing nothing.
224,"00:29:42,792","00:29:44,625",I'm climbing the walls.
225,"00:29:45,375","00:29:48,667","-And we need the money.
-That's true."
226,"00:29:52,083","00:29:54,042","Things are changing, my love."
227,"00:29:54,708","00:29:58,458","Bit by bit, but they're changing."
228,"00:29:59,333","00:30:02,458","Although one thing never changes,
do you know what it is?"
229,"00:30:03,833","00:30:07,125","You. You're still as hot as you were
the day I met you."
230,"00:30:08,208","00:30:09,333",Yeah?
231,"00:30:10,125","00:30:11,917","No, more."
232,"00:31:12,208","00:31:13,792","Good night, grandma."
233,"00:31:17,083","00:31:18,292",Me too.
234,"00:31:29,542","00:31:30,750",Here it goes!
235,"00:31:33,125","00:31:34,375","Let's go, guys."
236,"00:31:40,333","00:31:41,625","Oh, God!"
237,"00:31:49,708","00:31:50,583",Give it here.
238,"00:32:02,167","00:32:05,417","Have you seen the new girl?
What a show-off."
239,"00:32:05,583","00:32:08,750","She's stupid, she should never
have come to this school."
240,"00:32:09,167","00:32:12,292","You only have to look at her face
to see how stupid she is."
241,"00:32:19,167","00:32:20,917",What are you doing here alone?
242,"00:32:22,375","00:32:24,375",I saw what you did the other day...
243,"00:32:25,750","00:32:27,167",to the cars.
244,"00:32:31,542","00:32:33,000",I see you don't have any friends.
245,"00:32:34,750","00:32:36,333",Of course I do.
246,"00:32:37,750","00:32:39,000",I have to go.
247,"00:32:51,792","00:32:53,292",My name's Luna.
248,"00:33:10,750","00:33:14,417","I came to make you a soup,
it's always a nice dinner."
249,"00:33:17,833","00:33:19,542",I'm sorry about yesterday.
250,"00:33:22,000","00:33:26,167","Now that you're back,
the last thing I want is to argue."
251,"00:33:29,250","00:33:31,583",It wasn't a good idea to come here.
252,"00:33:37,917","00:33:39,083",Listen.
253,"00:33:41,042","00:33:42,750","I'm sorry about all this,"
254,"00:33:43,542","00:33:45,042",but I need you.
255,"00:33:46,792","00:33:48,500",I can't carry on alone.
256,"00:33:50,125","00:33:51,583",And you're my sister.
257,"00:33:53,208","00:33:54,583","I've got no one else, Al."
258,"00:33:57,333","00:33:58,667","So,"
259,"00:33:59,375","00:34:01,292","I don't care if you want
to keep the house."
260,"00:34:01,458","00:34:04,417","You can keep it all, I don't mind."
261,"00:34:07,708","00:34:09,042","But, please,"
262,"00:34:10,750","00:34:12,542","please, don't go."
263,"00:34:14,292","00:34:15,792","Please, help me."
264,"00:34:17,208","00:34:18,958",Mummy!
265,"00:34:19,208","00:34:21,000",Mummy! Help me!
266,"00:34:27,792","00:34:29,125",Nora!
267,"00:34:30,333","00:34:31,208",Nora!
268,"00:34:34,083","00:34:35,875","Nora, open the door!"
269,"00:34:36,333","00:34:37,292",The key!
270,"00:34:38,000","00:34:39,083",There is no key.
271,"00:34:39,250","00:34:41,250",Mummy!
272,"00:34:41,417","00:34:42,958",Mummy!
273,"00:34:43,125","00:34:44,083",Step back!
274,"00:34:46,542","00:34:47,333",Nora!
275,"00:34:47,958","00:34:49,500",Find something to use as a lever!
276,"00:34:55,417","00:34:56,500",Nora!
277,"00:35:04,250","00:35:05,792",Mummy!
278,"00:35:06,542","00:35:08,417",Run!
279,"00:35:10,000","00:35:11,125",Nora!
280,"00:35:32,125","00:35:33,833","Nora, move away from the door!"
281,"00:35:43,167","00:35:44,542",Leave me alone!
282,"00:35:57,458","00:35:59,667","Nora! Nora! Nora, are you OK?"
283,"00:35:59,833","00:36:01,875","Nora! Nora, look at me! Nora."
284,"00:36:02,042","00:36:03,208",Nora.
285,"00:36:03,375","00:36:04,417",Mummy.
286,"00:36:10,625","00:36:12,375",What happened here?
287,"00:36:24,833","00:36:26,333",She's asleep.
288,"00:36:28,208","00:36:29,875",We'll let her rest.
289,"00:36:46,708","00:36:47,917",What's that?
290,"00:36:50,875","00:36:52,333",It was Mum's.
291,"00:36:57,833","00:36:59,958",What's Nora doing with this crap?
292,"00:37:00,958","00:37:02,208",Al...
293,"00:37:03,208","00:37:05,542","You need to keep a close eye
on the girl."
294,"00:37:10,167","00:37:12,208","Perhaps... I don't know, but..."
295,"00:37:13,458","00:37:16,042","perhaps Mum wants her
to stand in front of the mirror."
296,"00:37:18,125","00:37:19,250",What mirror?
297,"00:37:20,542","00:37:22,417","Al, the mirror..."
298,"00:37:22,583","00:37:23,875","Sara, that's enough."
299,"00:37:24,625","00:37:26,792","I left to get away
from all that crap."
300,"00:37:28,417","00:37:29,667",Do you understand?
301,"00:37:33,583","00:37:36,042",Alicia. Alicia.
302,"00:37:37,208","00:37:39,708","We can't pretend
that nothing happened."
303,"00:37:43,625","00:37:45,333",Don't you remember that night?
304,"00:37:53,083","00:37:56,125",That night Fran slept over...
305,"00:37:57,875","00:38:00,042",and she took us to that place.
306,"00:38:22,667","00:38:24,125",It was the first time.
307,"00:38:27,875","00:38:29,333",She told us something.
308,"00:38:30,542","00:38:33,458","She wanted us to understand
the meaning of death."
309,"00:38:45,458","00:38:46,833","Look closely,"
310,"00:38:48,333","00:38:51,000",the spider will eat its prey.
311,"00:38:52,708","00:38:56,375","The disgusting insect
will cease to exist."
312,"00:38:57,292","00:39:00,292",That's death.
313,"00:39:01,292","00:39:04,833","But I'm not going to let
anyone devour me..."
314,"00:39:06,875","00:39:09,125",not until I decide.
315,"00:39:11,083","00:39:14,875",And that will never happen.
316,"00:39:28,125","00:39:30,375","This is all just an illusion,"
317,"00:39:32,375","00:39:33,875",like death.
318,"00:39:36,417","00:39:37,792",Do you understand?
319,"00:39:40,042","00:39:43,083","Open your eyes.
Open your eyes!"
320,"00:39:43,250","00:39:43,958",No!
321,"00:39:44,500","00:39:45,583",Look at yourselves!
322,"00:39:53,958","00:39:55,750","You were there too,"
323,"00:39:57,250","00:39:58,833",with Fran and I.
324,"00:40:03,750","00:40:07,375","Sometimes we blank out memories
so we can survive."
325,"00:40:07,708","00:40:09,125",It's normal.
326,"00:40:18,625","00:40:19,667",Where are you going?
327,"00:40:21,500","00:40:22,792",Alicia.
328,"00:40:23,792","00:40:26,208",What are you doing? Alicia.
329,"00:40:26,542","00:40:28,417",What are you going to do?
330,"00:40:30,042","00:40:32,042","Stop a moment, please."
331,"00:40:39,500","00:40:41,792",I won't let her hurt my daughter.
332,"00:40:42,917","00:40:45,167","Don't move! Sara, Sara!"
333,"00:40:45,333","00:40:46,917","-Not like that.
-It's for the best."
334,"00:40:47,083","00:40:48,875",Not like that. That's a crime.
335,"00:40:49,208","00:40:50,583","-Sara, Sara.
-No, no, no, no."
336,"00:40:50,750","00:40:53,167","-It's a crime.
-It's for the best! Listen to me!"
337,"00:40:53,750","00:40:55,667","-Sara...
-What's going on?"
338,"00:40:55,958","00:40:57,167","No, no, no, Mum..."
339,"00:40:58,833","00:41:00,292","-Mikel!
-How does it work?"
340,"00:41:01,167","00:41:03,000","-Mikel!
-How does it work?"
341,"00:41:21,792","00:41:23,875",I want to leave.
342,"00:41:42,375","00:41:44,708",I'm not sure about doing this.
343,"00:41:45,500","00:41:46,583",No.
344,"00:43:39,625","00:43:41,000",Bloody hell!
345,"00:43:58,167","00:43:59,292",Yes?
346,"00:44:00,042","00:44:01,167",Hello?
347,"00:44:30,250","00:44:31,542","What are you doing here, Nora?"
348,"00:44:34,333","00:44:35,292",Are you alright?
349,"00:44:38,042","00:44:39,250",Doesn't this work?
350,"00:44:40,458","00:44:41,833",I'll get some candles.
351,"00:44:45,083","00:44:48,667","Let's go up to bed, yeah?
It's very late. Come on."
352,"00:44:49,792","00:44:51,458",You've got no shoes on.
353,"00:44:52,417","00:44:53,917",I think I've lost something.
354,"00:44:54,375","00:44:55,292",What thing?
355,"00:44:56,250","00:44:57,917",Something I found.
356,"00:44:59,417","00:45:01,208",If you don't tell me what it is...
357,"00:45:09,500","00:45:10,833",We'll talk tomorrow.
358,"00:45:13,250","00:45:17,208","Promise me that you won't go
in grandma's room again."
359,"00:45:19,250","00:45:20,208",Ever.
360,"00:45:26,250","00:45:27,500",I love you.
361,"00:45:29,208","00:45:30,792",What were you burning?
362,"00:45:31,583","00:45:33,042",Loads of old junk.
363,"00:45:35,167","00:45:36,500",Grandma's things?
364,"00:45:37,917","00:45:40,125","Things that aren't useful
for anything."
365,"00:45:41,417","00:45:42,625","Come on, sleep time."
366,"00:45:43,917","00:45:45,167",Good night.
367,"00:46:25,792","00:46:26,792",Little pig.
368,"00:46:28,708","00:46:29,875",Little pig.
369,"00:46:30,250","00:46:32,375","Do you know what happened
in the village yesterday?"
370,"00:46:32,542","00:46:34,000","There was a power outage, right?"
371,"00:46:35,042","00:46:37,083",Remember the electrician I mentioned?
372,"00:46:37,875","00:46:39,250",Mr. Cotarelo.
373,"00:46:40,542","00:46:43,875","He electrocuted himself working on
the electrics at the school."
374,"00:46:44,917","00:46:46,458",It caused the power outage.
375,"00:46:46,625","00:46:48,083","Damn it, poor man."
376,"00:46:51,250","00:46:52,958","You burnt everything, didn't you?"
377,"00:46:53,583","00:46:54,458",Yes.
378,"00:46:56,292","00:46:58,917",It's much better without all that junk.
379,"00:46:59,083","00:47:00,792","Yeah, I think so too."
380,"00:47:01,125","00:47:02,958","Alright, I've finished here."
381,"00:47:04,000","00:47:04,917",Hello?
382,"00:47:05,083","00:47:07,833","-Hello, I'm calling from the school.
-Is Nora alright?"
383,"00:47:08,000","00:47:09,708","No, the children have gone
on an excursion today."
384,"00:47:09,875","00:47:13,167","-I want to talk to Mikel Fernández.
-That's me."
385,"00:47:14,375","00:47:15,708",When do you start?
386,"00:47:15,875","00:47:18,958","Well, straight away, today.
It's very urgent..."
387,"00:47:19,125","00:47:21,250","they're using a generator
to light the school."
388,"00:47:21,417","00:47:23,792","It's just a couple of days
and it pays well."
389,"00:47:27,750","00:47:31,000","-Did you hear me?
-Yes, I'm listening."
390,"00:47:32,583","00:47:35,417","Have you already told the hospital
you're leaving?"
391,"00:47:39,917","00:47:42,042","-No, not yet.
-Well, wait a while."
392,"00:47:42,208","00:47:46,208","As soon as I finish the job,
we'll go. I promise."
393,"00:47:46,500","00:47:47,917",I can't say no.
394,"00:47:48,083","00:47:50,958",And we need the money.
395,"00:47:51,667","00:47:54,000","Yes, yes, I agree. It's fine."
396,"00:47:55,667","00:47:58,083","-I love you.
-I love you too."
397,"00:48:36,625","00:48:39,417","-Thanks. See you later.
-Thank you. Bye, Pablo."
398,"00:49:46,250","00:49:47,750",Open your mouth.
399,"00:50:40,083","00:50:41,625",Thanks for returning it to me.
400,"00:50:45,042","00:50:46,542",Where did you find it?
401,"00:50:47,583","00:50:48,917",I lost it.
402,"00:50:49,667","00:50:51,042",Somewhere.
403,"00:50:52,750","00:50:56,333","Put it on,
your grandma wants you to wear it."
404,"00:50:56,500","00:50:57,917",You know her?
405,"00:51:03,250","00:51:06,708",Grandmas always want the best for us.
406,"00:51:24,583","00:51:25,833",Sara.
407,"00:51:27,750","00:51:29,000",Mikel isn't here?
408,"00:51:29,917","00:51:32,750","No, the school asked him
to fix the lighting."
409,"00:51:32,917","00:51:33,625",And Nora?
410,"00:51:34,542","00:51:36,042",Nora's sleeping.
411,"00:51:36,750","00:51:37,917",What's wrong?
412,"00:51:43,542","00:51:44,958",It's Mum.
413,"00:51:46,500","00:51:49,375","This may seem a little weird, but..."
414,"00:51:50,333","00:51:52,333",Look at the medallion she was wearing.
415,"00:52:05,083","00:52:07,708",I think she used it to control us.
416,"00:52:08,708","00:52:11,250","And now she's using it with Nora, I bet."
417,"00:52:14,417","00:52:16,750",We have to get rid of the locket.
418,"00:52:17,792","00:52:19,375",She keeps it in the drawer.
419,"00:52:28,458","00:52:29,542",It's not here.
420,"00:52:33,125","00:52:35,042",Victoria doesn't know how to die.
421,"00:52:36,708","00:52:38,333",She wants to stay.
422,"00:52:48,250","00:52:49,458",Forgive me.
423,"00:52:51,542","00:52:55,292","Yes, I've been selfish."
424,"00:52:57,083","00:52:59,417",She's never going to forgive us.
425,"00:53:03,667","00:53:05,375",She's not going to forgive us.
426,"00:54:22,833","00:54:24,792","No matter how much you insist,"
427,"00:54:25,833","00:54:27,542",you're already dead.
428,"00:54:49,708","00:54:50,958",Guys!
429,"00:54:52,792","00:54:53,875",It was you.
430,"00:54:55,042","00:54:56,375",Leave me alone.
431,"00:54:58,917","00:55:01,500","She's a foul-smelling,
conceited swine."
432,"00:55:01,667","00:55:03,000",Just like her father.
433,"00:55:03,167","00:55:05,458","Have you seen him?
He smells like fish."
434,"00:55:06,500","00:55:10,042","You're disgusting, just like
that crazy old bat you live with."
435,"00:55:12,792","00:55:13,875",What are you looking at?
436,"00:55:14,042","00:55:17,458","I'd much rather be like her
than be like you."
437,"00:55:17,625","00:55:20,667","Loser. Freaky bitch.
Who do you think you are?"
438,"00:56:01,875","00:56:04,750","I'm know they were making fun
of her and her grandmother."
439,"00:56:06,083","00:56:08,458","But I wasn't expecting
behaviour like that."
440,"00:56:10,875","00:56:12,375",I don't understand.
441,"00:56:16,417","00:56:19,458",We're very sorry. It's just...
442,"00:56:20,833","00:56:23,000","Nora isn't like that.
She's not like that."
443,"00:56:23,833","00:56:25,500","That's what I thought,"
444,"00:56:27,000","00:56:29,750","but we have to expel her
for a few days."
445,"00:57:27,792","00:57:29,000","What's up, sweetie?"
446,"00:57:29,917","00:57:31,125",I'm bored.
447,"00:57:32,208","00:57:35,250","Yeah, but that's part of the punishment."
448,"00:57:38,750","00:57:41,042","-Can I go out to the garden?
-No."
449,"00:57:42,625","00:57:43,417",OK.
450,"00:57:44,708","00:57:45,708",Nora.
451,"00:57:51,083","00:57:53,208","Just the garden, alright?"
452,"00:57:54,792","00:57:55,750",Nora.
453,"00:59:58,417","00:59:59,458",Nora.
454,"01:00:00,875","01:00:02,375",What are you doing here?
455,"01:00:06,958","01:00:08,792",Has something happened at home?
456,"01:00:13,333","01:00:14,625",How did you get in?
457,"01:00:15,625","01:00:17,750",The back door was open.
458,"01:00:25,750","01:00:27,500","You're very careless, Sara."
459,"01:00:29,167","01:00:30,750",Are you one of Nora's friends?
460,"01:00:32,833","01:00:34,542",You were always very naive.
461,"01:00:35,875","01:00:38,583","-What?
-You heard me, idiot."
462,"01:00:40,083","01:00:43,208","-Nora, who's that?
-That's Luna, my friend."
463,"01:00:57,417","01:01:00,333","We know where the locket
you're looking for is."
464,"01:01:00,750","01:01:01,583",Where?
465,"01:01:01,958","01:01:03,375",Buried in your garden.
466,"01:01:08,708","01:01:10,042",It's you.
467,"01:01:10,833","01:01:12,042","Right, Mum?"
468,"01:01:20,208","01:01:23,000","If I were you,
I'd get a shovel and start digging."
469,"01:01:28,833","01:01:32,500","Alright, sweetie,
you've hidden really well. I give up."
470,"01:01:36,708","01:01:39,042","Come out,
this isn't funny anymore."
471,"01:01:47,708","01:01:50,750","You have to pay for what you did,
you and your sister."
472,"01:01:54,125","01:01:57,083","I'd suggest you carry on,
for your own good."
473,"01:02:20,500","01:02:22,750","Sara!
Nora's escaped, we can't find her!"
474,"01:02:22,917","01:02:25,042","Call as soon as you get this, please."
475,"01:02:27,625","01:02:28,917",Nora!
476,"01:02:31,125","01:02:32,792",Nora!
477,"01:02:52,083","01:02:53,833","Are you looking for this, aunt?"
478,"01:02:56,417","01:02:58,500",Why are you doing this to me?
479,"01:03:02,500","01:03:03,583",Why?
480,"01:03:18,333","01:03:20,083","Nora, help me!"
481,"01:03:29,208","01:03:31,750","She's still moving, hit her harder!"
482,"01:03:39,167","01:03:40,375",Coward!
483,"01:04:12,292","01:04:13,750",What clothes was she wearing?
484,"01:04:13,917","01:04:17,000","-Her blue school tracksuit.
-Tracksuit..."
485,"01:04:17,167","01:04:19,333","-Green T-shirt.
-Blue tracksuit and a green T-shirt."
486,"01:04:19,500","01:04:21,958","OK, thanks. Thank you."
487,"01:04:26,833","01:04:28,250",They'll find her.
488,"01:04:55,875","01:04:59,708","You're ready to complete the link.
Come closer."
489,"01:05:00,833","01:05:03,125",You just have to look into her eyes.
490,"01:05:17,750","01:05:19,125",I'm scared.
491,"01:05:19,958","01:05:21,792",It's too late for that now.
492,"01:05:23,500","01:05:27,292","No one loves you anymore, Nora.
Not even your parents."
493,"01:05:28,917","01:05:32,083","What will they think when they find out
you killed your aunty?"
494,"01:05:33,667","01:05:35,917","Is there any sense in life
for you anymore?"
495,"01:07:12,208","01:07:14,333","Nora, what are you doing here?"
496,"01:07:14,500","01:07:15,958",I'm wiping up sand.
497,"01:07:16,333","01:07:18,833","We looked for you everywhere.
Where were you?"
498,"01:07:19,000","01:07:20,833",I was watching the waves.
499,"01:07:25,333","01:07:27,917",My love. My love.
500,"01:07:41,250","01:07:44,708","Hi, this is Sara.
Leave a message after the beep. Thanks."
501,"01:07:45,083","01:07:47,417","Sara!
Nora's escaped, we can't find her!"
502,"01:07:47,583","01:07:49,833","Call as soon as you get this, please."
503,"01:08:11,208","01:08:12,542",I found this.
504,"01:08:13,167","01:08:15,000",It has phone numbers written down.
505,"01:08:15,583","01:08:17,083",Maybe someone knows something.
506,"01:08:28,542","01:08:29,375",Go!
507,"01:08:30,458","01:08:32,750","No, she closed the store."
508,"01:08:46,875","01:08:48,708","Nora, what did you do to that dog?"
509,"01:08:49,292","01:08:50,333",Nothing.
510,"01:08:51,667","01:08:52,750","Nora, I saw you!"
511,"01:08:56,833","01:08:58,542",He was destroying the plants.
512,"01:08:59,708","01:09:01,333",There's nothing else here.
513,"01:09:03,167","01:09:04,917",We should go to the police station.
514,"01:09:05,083","01:09:06,042",I'll come with you.
515,"01:09:06,375","01:09:08,167","Yes, are you coming?"
516,"01:09:09,250","01:09:10,333",Let's go.
517,"01:13:50,500","01:13:52,417","Anna, come here a moment, please."
518,"01:13:54,500","01:13:55,667",Yes?
519,"01:13:58,250","01:14:00,167",You don't need to stay today.
520,"01:14:01,500","01:14:04,583","I'm not going to the hospital,
I'll care for my mother."
521,"01:14:04,875","01:14:06,167",OK.
522,"01:14:06,750","01:14:08,958","Perfect.
I'll come back tomorrow then."
523,"01:14:09,125","01:14:10,458",Very well.
524,"01:14:10,958","01:14:12,625","-Bye.
-Bye."
525,"01:14:20,917","01:14:22,375",What happened to the nurse?
526,"01:14:23,458","01:14:27,250","She couldn't stay,
she said she had a personal issue."
527,"01:14:28,458","01:14:32,000","I have to buy some gear,
I haven't finished at the school yet."
528,"01:14:32,125","01:14:35,250","I'll stay. I'll call the hospital,
it won't be a problem."
529,"01:14:37,292","01:14:38,208",Are you sure?
530,"01:14:38,917","01:14:40,000",What's wrong?
531,"01:14:42,333","01:14:44,375",Hurry up or you'll be late.
532,"01:14:48,000","01:14:50,542","And you, behave yourself."
533,"01:14:55,000","01:14:56,417","Come on, sweetie."
534,"01:17:16,750","01:17:17,875",Nora!
535,"01:17:18,792","01:17:21,375","What are you doing here?
Shouldn't you be in class?"
536,"01:17:21,625","01:17:23,000","It's boring, Mummy."
537,"01:17:23,917","01:17:26,167",Miss Mejido is unbearable.
538,"01:17:35,750","01:17:37,792",Why didn't you disconnect her before?
539,"01:17:38,292","01:17:39,917",Do I have to do everything?
540,"01:17:44,125","01:17:47,125","I don't need this disgusting
sack of bones anymore."
541,"01:17:52,542","01:17:53,625",What are you doing?
542,"01:17:57,208","01:17:58,708",Give me my daughter back!
543,"01:17:58,875","01:18:01,042","-Mummy...
-Give me my daughter back!"
544,"01:18:01,125","01:18:02,500","Mummy, no!"
545,"01:18:03,083","01:18:04,333","Mummy, no!"
546,"01:18:09,125","01:18:11,583","You never loved me, little pig."
547,"01:18:12,000","01:18:13,583",What have you done to Nora?
548,"01:18:15,167","01:18:17,708","If you say a word of this to dad,"
549,"01:18:18,583","01:18:19,750",I'll kill him.
550,"01:18:36,875","01:18:38,000",Hello.
551,"01:18:41,542","01:18:42,542",Daddy!
552,"01:18:42,708","01:18:43,667","Hello, my love."
553,"01:18:43,833","01:18:45,542","Careful with dad, he's very tired."
554,"01:18:45,708","01:18:46,875",Have you had dinner?
555,"01:18:47,042","01:18:48,167",Let's eat.
556,"01:18:50,917","01:18:52,417",Pass me the salt.
557,"01:18:53,542","01:18:54,667",Thank you.
558,"01:19:04,625","01:19:08,208",I never told you how grandpa died.
559,"01:19:10,083","01:19:11,208","Alicia, darling..."
560,"01:19:11,375","01:19:12,917",It's important.
561,"01:19:22,000","01:19:24,583",We hadn't seen dad for a long time.
562,"01:19:25,333","01:19:27,042",He'd been travelling.
563,"01:19:31,375","01:19:34,667","Sara and I wanted to play with him,
for him to notice us."
564,"01:20:57,167","01:20:59,750","Sara, where's your sister?"
565,"01:21:01,833","01:21:05,417","We got his attention,
so he'd come down to the basement."
566,"01:21:08,000","01:21:10,667",I hid under the stairs...
567,"01:21:11,583","01:21:12,583",to give him...
568,"01:21:13,917","01:21:15,125",a surprise.
569,"01:21:18,583","01:21:19,625",And...
570,"01:21:21,583","01:21:22,917",And he fell.
571,"01:21:32,000","01:21:34,583","Victoria always blamed us,"
572,"01:21:35,833","01:21:37,208",but we were only playing.
573,"01:21:37,375","01:21:39,000",Liar!
574,"01:21:39,167","01:21:40,083",Nora.
575,"01:21:47,292","01:21:49,500","-Do you think it's normal...
-You don't understand."
576,"01:21:50,792","01:21:53,333","What? Tell me, what?"
577,"01:21:56,583","01:21:57,750",I'm going to work.
578,"01:21:58,208","01:22:01,417","Pack our stuff, as soon as I finish
at the school, we'll leave."
579,"01:22:01,583","01:22:03,542","That's what you wanted, right?"
580,"01:22:03,708","01:22:06,167","You've got what you wanted.
For fuck's sake!"
581,"01:22:53,292","01:22:57,458","I can still feel
the warmth of his hands."
582,"01:22:59,500","01:23:03,583","The most attractive man
I've ever seen in my life."
583,"01:23:06,042","01:23:08,125",Alicia looks a bit like him.
584,"01:23:12,250","01:23:13,792",She has his eyes.
585,"01:23:15,458","01:23:16,917",But not his heart.
586,"01:23:21,875","01:23:23,250",Will you kill her?
587,"01:23:24,417","01:23:27,875",I'd rather let her suffer.
588,"01:23:29,083","01:23:30,333",And him?
589,"01:23:31,250","01:23:32,750",Maybe.
590,"01:23:34,042","01:23:36,875",That way she'll suffer even more.
591,"01:23:38,083","01:23:39,625",Lose everything.
592,"01:23:40,208","01:23:43,167","Everything except
her darling daughter."
593,"01:23:44,542","01:23:48,250","Who she'll have to look at,
knowing that it's no longer her..."
594,"01:23:49,292","01:23:52,917","but the thing she hates
and despises the most..."
595,"01:24:04,042","01:24:05,667",Ah! Bloody hell!
596,"01:24:09,542","01:24:14,000","Mikel, come home if you hear this.
Mikel, please!"
597,"01:24:34,833","01:24:35,792",Nora?
598,"01:26:58,667","01:26:59,708",Alicia?
599,"01:27:02,250","01:27:03,333",Alicia?
600,"01:27:04,625","01:27:05,500",Alicia!
601,"01:27:05,708","01:27:06,500",Nora!
602,"01:27:07,250","01:27:08,208","Nora, where's Mum?"
603,"01:27:11,375","01:27:12,375",Nora!
604,"01:27:15,625","01:27:16,708",Where's Mum?
605,"01:27:25,333","01:27:26,375",Alicia?
606,"01:27:29,917","01:27:31,583","Don't move from there, sweetie."
607,"01:27:43,292","01:27:44,167",Alicia?
608,"01:28:00,083","01:28:01,542",Alicia!
609,"01:28:04,875","01:28:06,083",Gotcha!
610,"01:29:16,042","01:29:17,417","Sorry, daddy."
611,"01:29:19,375","01:29:21,125",It was Mum's fault.
612,"01:29:57,792","01:29:59,000",Nora!
613,"01:30:14,375","01:30:16,792",Nora! Nora!
614,"01:30:19,292","01:30:21,625",Nora! Nora!
615,"01:30:21,792","01:30:23,375","Nora, look at me!"
616,"01:30:52,000","01:30:53,083",Let her go!
617,"01:31:58,167","01:31:59,458",You want more?
618,"01:32:00,625","01:32:04,417","The best is yet to come. Come here, pig!"
619,"01:32:06,000","01:32:07,125","No, Mikel!"
620,"01:32:07,292","01:32:08,500",Don't kill her!
621,"01:32:10,250","01:32:11,458",Don't kill her! No!
622,"01:32:13,625","01:32:15,042","No, Mikel, no."
623,"01:32:15,208","01:32:16,333",Don't kill her.
624,"01:32:16,500","01:32:17,708","Don't kill her, no."
625,"01:32:18,875","01:32:20,000","No, no, no!"
626,"01:34:09,000","01:34:13,250","You won't see Nora again
in your whole goddamn life."
627,"01:34:16,500","01:34:17,958",You're going to rot here.
628,"01:34:26,250","01:34:28,208","You're not going to destroy
any more lives."
629,"01:34:54,250","01:34:55,500",My love.
630,"01:35:01,708","01:35:04,667","You have to hold on, do you hear me?"
631,"01:35:25,958","01:35:27,375",You have to get better.
632,"01:36:07,625","01:36:10,833","I have to be
what I want to be, grandma."
633,"01:36:13,875","01:36:15,667",You have to go with grandpa.
634,"01:36:17,042","01:36:18,375",He's a good man.
635,"01:36:20,542","01:36:23,583","He says that heaven is like
walking on soft sand."
636,"01:36:25,333","01:36:26,667",You'll be happy there.
637,"01:36:28,333","01:36:31,208","And you can come to see me
whenever you want."
638,"01:36:32,917","01:36:34,167",Like he has.
639,"01:36:36,958","01:36:38,792","You can protect me, grandma."
640,"01:37:00,583","01:37:02,000","Goodbye, grandma."
641,"01:37:27,125","01:37:28,458","Nora, darling."
642,"01:37:28,625","01:37:29,833",Alicia!
643,"01:37:32,375","01:37:34,125","Daddy, mummy."
644,"01:37:36,083","01:37:37,250",What?
645,"01:37:37,417","01:37:39,292",I love you lots.
646,"01:37:40,958","01:37:42,417","Talk to me, talk to me!"
647,"01:37:42,500","01:37:44,708",I missed you so much.
648,"01:37:54,750","01:37:57,750",MISSING
649,"01:38:56,958","01:38:59,875",Grandmas always want the best for us.
