What happened?"
25,"00:07:33,230","00:07:35,168",Who did that?
26,"00:07:35,193","00:07:37,050",It was the rat.
27,"00:07:37,889","00:07:40,672","That rat, did that?"
28,"00:07:41,981","00:07:44,114",It's was a vicious rat.
29,"00:07:44,450","00:07:48,876","Yeah. It's a god damn miracle that
you're still surviving on your own."
30,"00:07:48,901","00:07:51,522","Well.
How about a drink?"
31,"00:07:52,168","00:07:55,431","- No, thank you.
- Suit yourself."
32,"00:07:55,788","00:07:57,156","- Oh yeah!

Are you going to play nice?"

Okay."
39,"00:08:29,325","00:08:32,174","- Drinks are on you.
- Yeah!"
40,"00:08:35,541","00:08:37,789",Still undefeated.
41,"00:08:37,814","00:08:39,541","So, what else you got?"
42,"00:08:39,566","00:08:40,805",Oh.
43,"00:08:49,713","00:08:53,417","Well. For this junk,
I can give you the usual."

46,"00:09:06,319","00:09:08,071",Looks worse than ever.
47,"00:09:08,100","00:09:10,549","Well. If you feel like
complaining some more,"
48,"00:09:10,574","00:09:14,604","you are more than welcome to
lap up whatever is on the floor."

50,"00:09:18,937","00:09:23,719","Hey!
Keep peddling, you piece of shit."

53,"00:09:32,777","00:09:37,746","I could always...
toss this in for good measure."
54,"00:09:57,315","00:10:00,248","What the hell do you
think you are doing? Huh."
55,"00:10:00,273","00:10:03,467","You can't just walk into
a man's personal bubble."
56,"00:10:03,492","00:10:06,040","His-
His what?"
57,"00:10:06,065","00:10:07,696",A man's personal space.
58,"00:10:07,721","00:10:09,990","The arm length radius, yeah."
59,"00:10:10,015","00:10:13,714","My mother fucking comfort zone.
And it's family only."
60,"00:10:13,739","00:10:15,058",Sir?
61,"00:10:17,784","00:10:19,968","Can't you see I'm in the
middle of something, Heek?"
62,"00:10:19,993","00:10:22,923","- Another one has gone missing.
- Who?"
63,"00:10:23,677","00:10:25,216","I haven't got all day, you are
going to tell me who it is"
64,"00:10:25,241","00:10:27,035","or I am going to
beat it out of you."
65,"00:10:27,060","00:10:29,163",It's your brother.
66,"00:10:30,018","00:10:31,744",Fuck!
67,"00:10:32,277","00:10:34,001",Let's roll!
68,"00:10:34,026","00:10:35,166","- Let's go.
- Yeh!"
69,"00:10:35,191","00:10:36,889","Come on.
Move it!"
70,"00:10:38,783","00:10:40,376",Let's go!
71,"00:11:13,689","00:11:16,848",Outstanding performance.
72,"00:11:17,060","00:11:20,433","Your infamous brother
would be proud."
73,"00:11:21,329","00:11:24,025",You have any last request?
74,"00:11:26,985","00:11:30,559","Try not to see this as
punishment, but rather"
75,"00:11:30,584","00:11:36,303","an opportunity to prove your
usefulness in these difficult times."
76,"00:11:46,554","00:11:48,817",RAAHHHH!
77,"00:11:49,503","00:11:52,762","Your reign of justice is over, Turbo rider."
78,"00:11:52,787","00:11:56,215","To be a true hero, you'll
have to save your girlfriend."
79,"00:11:56,240","00:11:58,485","Save me, Turbo rider."
80,"00:11:58,510","00:12:00,603","Your evil plan will fail, Dr. Robotor."
81,"00:12:00,628","00:12:02,367",I will destroy you with my turbo glove.
82,"00:12:02,392","00:12:05,782","The ultimate weapon
against the robot threat."
83,"00:12:06,207","00:12:08,513",But I am not ordinary robot.
84,"00:12:08,538","00:12:12,320","I am a secret weapon!
Ah-ha-ha-ha."
85,"00:12:15,345","00:12:19,106","Prepare to taste...
a full turbo charge of..."
86,"00:12:20,511","00:12:21,507",Um.
87,"00:12:21,532","00:12:23,098",Hey.
88,"00:12:25,132","00:12:27,326",What's that in your hand?
89,"00:12:27,740","00:12:29,164",It's a...
90,"00:12:29,794","00:12:31,584",It's-It's a comic book.
91,"00:12:31,609","00:12:33,168",What is it about?
92,"00:12:33,193","00:12:35,670",It's-It's about Turbo rider.
93,"00:12:36,261","00:12:38,217",That's rared.
94,"00:12:39,039","00:12:40,685",Are you alone?
95,"00:12:40,710","00:12:42,664",Do you have any friend?
96,"00:12:42,689","00:12:44,852","Oh. Do you want
to play hide and seek?"
97,"00:12:45,387","00:12:47,176",I am...
98,"00:12:48,235","00:12:50,356","- I got to go.
- Wait!"
99,"00:12:50,381","00:12:53,146","Before we go, I just have
to take care of something."
100,"00:12:58,317","00:12:59,570",It's okay now.
101,"00:12:59,595","00:13:01,498","You don't have to worry
about me anymore."
102,"00:13:01,538","00:13:05,634","I found a new friend.
I'll be fine, I promise."
103,"00:13:12,292","00:13:13,657",I'm...
104,"00:13:14,711","00:13:15,954",Hm.
105,"00:14:22,554","00:14:23,820","Sir.
Sir."
106,"00:14:23,845","00:14:26,520",I've-I've been thinking.
107,"00:14:26,545","00:14:28,003","I don't know.  Do you
think it would a better"
108,"00:14:28,028","00:14:29,985","to keep looking for
the water source."
109,"00:14:30,010","00:14:32,827","Instead of, you know,
fighting Zeus."
110,"00:14:32,852","00:14:35,395","Are you saying we should
abandon my brother."
111,"00:14:35,420","00:14:38,373","No, no, no.
But, I mean."
112,"00:14:38,912","00:14:41,327","Do-Do you really think
we stand a chance."
113,"00:14:41,352","00:14:43,798","Chance? Is that how you
think I became a champion?"
114,"00:14:43,823","00:14:46,932","A man with a good plan has
already won half the battle."
115,"00:14:46,957","00:14:50,036","- So, what is the plan?
- Right now."
116,"00:14:50,061","00:14:52,792",The plan is to take a piss.
117,"00:15:16,483","00:15:18,579",Who needs chance anyway.
118,"00:15:30,519","00:15:33,151",What a cheap move.
119,"00:15:35,948","00:15:38,567","And I know that was
going to be you."
120,"00:15:56,807","00:15:59,832","Soon you'll have to learn
how to fix it by yourself."
121,"00:16:05,351","00:16:07,037",Here you go.
122,"00:16:44,314","00:16:46,863","- Good morning.
- Woh!"
123,"00:16:49,196","00:16:51,108",What're you doing here?
124,"00:16:51,765","00:16:53,461",Breakfast.
125,"00:16:57,775","00:17:01,162","Wow.
Where did you find all this staff."
126,"00:17:01,390","00:17:04,912","Ha.
Look at all of these."
127,"00:17:05,563","00:17:08,508","It's like a museum
of coolest in here."
128,"00:17:12,870","00:17:15,127","Oh.
I love one of these."
129,"00:17:15,152","00:17:16,444","Hey, nice colors."
130,"00:17:16,469","00:17:18,044","Look at that dress,
I love the color"
131,"00:17:18,069","00:17:19,649","of that dress. It's so nice.
Oh my god."
132,"00:17:19,674","00:17:22,564","- There're so many little...
- Hey, hey. Don't touch that!"
133,"00:17:25,300","00:17:26,968",Are you okay?
134,"00:17:27,126","00:17:28,301",Yeah.
135,"00:17:28,326","00:17:29,449",Just.
136,"00:17:29,474","00:17:33,717","You know, you stepped in
my manly- bubble thing."
137,"00:17:33,742","00:17:35,308",Oh.
138,"00:17:35,470","00:17:37,401",Did I break it?
139,"00:17:37,662","00:17:39,304",No.
140,"00:17:39,562","00:17:41,421",It's-It's more of a...
141,"00:17:41,446","00:17:43,701",an arm length...
142,"00:17:43,726","00:17:47,059","comfort,
radius zone."
143,"00:17:47,084","00:17:48,377",Okay?
144,"00:17:48,402","00:17:50,183","Oh, I see."
145,"00:17:51,885","00:17:54,670","- How did you find me?
- Oh, it's the bracelet."
146,"00:17:54,695","00:17:57,205","Oh.
Great."
147,"00:17:57,230","00:17:58,475",Well.
148,"00:17:58,869","00:18:00,369",How do you get it off?
149,"00:18:00,394","00:18:02,584","Oh, you just don't."
150,"00:18:03,250","00:18:04,678",Sit.
151,"00:18:04,703","00:18:07,420","Eat your cereal before
it gets all mushy."
152,"00:18:15,327","00:18:17,140","Okay. How do I know
you didn't poison this?"
153,"00:18:17,165","00:18:19,714","Well. Because,
friends don't poison friends."
154,"00:18:19,739","00:18:22,609","No no. Okay.
We-We are not friends."
155,"00:18:22,634","00:18:24,099","Okay. I don't even
know who you are."
156,"00:18:24,124","00:18:25,958",We met at the playground.
157,"00:18:25,983","00:18:28,543","Yeah. But-But
you broke into my home."
158,"00:18:28,568","00:18:33,103","You-You touch my things
and you"
159,"00:18:33,678","00:18:35,210",you talked to dead people.
160,"00:18:35,235","00:18:38,876","And I brought you back
your Turbo rider comic book."
161,"00:18:41,624","00:18:44,035","Well.
Okay."
162,"00:18:44,059","00:18:45,703","You know.
I thought you would"
163,"00:18:45,728","00:18:47,806","want to hang out.
But-"
164,"00:18:47,831","00:18:50,128","You know, if you
want me to go then-"
165,"00:18:50,153","00:18:51,253",Wait.
166,"00:18:51,278","00:18:53,004","Okay.
You can-"
167,"00:18:53,029","00:18:55,051","You can stay.
But-But just for a while."
168,"00:18:55,076","00:18:57,170",My name is Apple.
169,"00:18:58,447","00:19:00,066",Of course it is.
170,"00:19:05,050","00:19:07,270","What are we
going to do today?"
171,"00:19:07,668","00:19:10,411",I am going scavenging.
172,"00:19:10,436","00:19:11,905","Right.
I love to scavenging."
173,"00:19:11,930","00:19:13,610","No-no-no...
You-you."
174,"00:19:13,635","00:19:16,899","You stay here.
Just don't"
175,"00:19:17,202","00:19:18,921",touch anything.
176,"00:19:19,486","00:19:20,892","Well.
Why can't I come?"
177,"00:19:20,917","00:19:22,679",Umm.
178,"00:19:22,746","00:19:25,503","Well.
Because-"
179,"00:19:26,325","00:19:28,252",Because you don't have a bike.
180,"00:19:32,373","00:19:34,173",(What's that?)
181,"00:19:38,833","00:19:41,686","We-
are going scavenging."
182,"00:19:41,711","00:19:43,493","Yeah.
(Clap clap clap)"
183,"00:19:45,266","00:19:47,541",We love scavenging.
184,"00:19:49,657","00:19:51,125",Okay.
185,"00:20:02,741","00:20:04,390",You were right!
186,"00:20:04,415","00:20:08,141","Your manly bubble
is really comfortable!"
187,"00:20:11,242","00:20:13,225","Okay.
We need to talk."
188,"00:20:14,600","00:20:15,735","Okay.
If you are coming with me,"
189,"00:20:15,760","00:20:18,180","you need to follow the
survival rules of the Wasteland."
190,"00:20:18,205","00:20:20,710","Okay.
I love rules."
191,"00:20:20,735","00:20:23,185","Okay.
Rule #1."
192,"00:20:23,210","00:20:26,612","- Always have water on you.
- Water. Check."
193,"00:20:27,178","00:20:32,059","Okay. And rule 2:
Always stay within the safe zone."
194,"00:20:32,084","00:20:34,727","Oh.
That's clever."
195,"00:20:35,817","00:20:37,212",Thank you.
196,"00:20:37,890","00:20:40,619","Rule #3:
Always have your wheels ready."

198,"00:20:43,056","00:20:44,249",Um.
199,"00:20:45,459","00:20:46,642",Oh.
200,"00:20:47,656","00:20:49,093",Yeah ha.
201,"00:21:02,186","00:21:06,436","#4: Try avoiding people.
Especial those who looked evil."
202,"00:21:06,461","00:21:09,067","Well.
I'm happy you didn't avoid me."
203,"00:21:09,092","00:21:10,996",Like I had a choice.
204,"00:21:29,444","00:21:32,840","For you're Fredric,
the arm wrestler."
205,"00:21:32,865","00:21:37,018","You have an eye for
the obvious, Zeus"

It's wonderful to finally put a"

208,"00:21:42,252","00:21:45,357","And an honor
to have you here."
209,"00:21:47,101","00:21:50,481","You can shove that
honor up your ass."
210,"00:21:50,914","00:21:53,543","Now. What the hell have you
done with my brother."
211,"00:21:53,568","00:21:56,141","Patience, my good man.
Patience."
212,"00:21:56,166","00:21:58,075","Now.
Your way of settling things,"
213,"00:21:58,100","00:21:59,652",I find a bit tedious.
214,"00:21:59,677","00:22:02,362","Around here we like to
do things with a little more"

Blades and"
218,"00:22:13,324","00:22:16,530","fire!
Ha."
219,"00:22:26,961","00:22:29,881","When I say
blades and fire,"
220,"00:22:29,906","00:22:34,046",I want blades and fire!
221,"00:22:34,407","00:22:36,104",Do you mind?
222,"00:22:37,506","00:22:39,456","No, go ahead."
223,"00:22:42,003","00:22:43,391",Thank you.
224,"00:22:44,737","00:22:46,231",Yes.

227,"00:22:51,900","00:22:53,039",Well.
228,"00:22:53,064","00:22:56,728","What do you say we see
what the man has to offer, huh?"
229,"00:22:58,055","00:23:00,089","Alright, Zeus."
230,"00:23:01,376","00:23:03,881","But you won't like
what you see."
231,"00:23:15,570","00:23:17,673","You think I didn't
see that coming?"
232,"00:23:17,698","00:23:19,392",I have eyes everywhere.

240,"00:23:51,368","00:23:54,516","Okay. Now, we really
need to find you a bike."
241,"00:23:54,608","00:23:56,897",Maybe a helmet.

264,"00:25:51,993","00:25:53,399",No.
265,"00:25:54,191","00:25:56,855","- Can I ask you a question?
- Sure."
266,"00:25:57,851","00:25:59,841",What are you doing here?
267,"00:26:00,732","00:26:03,236",I'm practicing my swing.
268,"00:26:05,039","00:26:07,290","I mean how did
you get here?"
269,"00:26:07,315","00:26:08,894",This side of the Wasteland.
270,"00:26:08,918","00:26:10,955","Well. My last best friend
was a water hunter."
271,"00:26:10,980","00:26:13,031","So.
I tagged along."
272,"00:26:13,056","00:26:16,133","Then he died and...
here we are."
273,"00:26:17,783","00:26:19,336",I'm sorry.
274,"00:26:19,466","00:26:20,829","Why?
What'd you do?"
275,"00:26:20,854","00:26:23,447","No.
I mean-I mean about your friend."
276,"00:26:23,472","00:26:26,664","Oh no, don't be.
He's dead."
277,"00:26:31,044","00:26:33,739","- So. Where did you come from?
- Pretty far."
278,"00:26:33,764","00:26:37,025","All the way from the
other side of the Wasteland."
279,"00:26:38,166","00:26:39,754","I always wonder what
the other side look like."
280,"00:26:39,779","00:26:41,694",It's kind of Grey.
281,"00:26:41,719","00:26:43,623",And dusty.
282,"00:26:44,085","00:26:46,429","Well.
I could show you."
283,"00:26:46,849","00:26:49,092",I-I can't

YOU'RE IT!"
287,"00:26:57,666","00:26:59,222","- Ha!
- What?"
288,"00:26:59,247","00:27:01,595","You're it, I tagged you.
Now you got to tag me back."
289,"00:27:01,620","00:27:03,305",If you can!
290,"00:27:03,330","00:27:04,792",Come on!
291,"00:27:08,633","00:27:11,801","- Oh. Look, it's a bird.
- What?"
292,"00:27:13,024","00:27:14,421",Now.
293,"00:27:16,318","00:27:18,466",You're freaking fast.

300,"00:28:01,338","00:28:04,425","Yeah.
There're these..."
301,"00:28:04,450","00:28:07,784","big creatures that used to
walk here a long time ago."
302,"00:28:07,809","00:28:11,657","And they got killed by
this big explosion. That is"
303,"00:28:11,777","00:28:13,788",kind of what happened to us.
304,"00:28:15,865","00:28:17,249",Right?
305,"00:28:34,066","00:28:36,958","Run! Run!
Run!"
306,"00:29:22,890","00:29:24,815",Aww!

The situation is critical."

has been breached."
309,"00:31:17,464","00:31:21,266","We have reached
maximum casualty level."

311,"00:31:25,507","00:31:29,459","We have to rid these damn
machines with everything we got."
312,"00:31:31,435","00:31:33,236",You are
313,"00:31:33,841","00:31:36,242",our last hope.

322,"00:35:17,695","00:35:22,017","Fredric,
the 1 handed arm wrestler."
323,"00:35:22,042","00:35:26,442","Now, Fredric wishes to be
reunited with his loving brother."
324,"00:35:26,467","00:35:28,474","We all know how
generous in spirit I am."
325,"00:35:28,499","00:35:31,392","And I'm going to
grant him his wish."
326,"00:35:32,453","00:35:35,750","I bet you're wondering
what this contraption is. Hmm."
327,"00:35:35,775","00:35:38,751","Do you like science?
I absolutely love it."
328,"00:35:38,776","00:35:41,298","For example.
Do you know how much water"
329,"00:35:41,323","00:35:43,840","there is in an average
human body?"
330,"00:35:47,558","00:35:51,629","Your blood is 83% water.
Your muscle tissue, 75%."
331,"00:35:51,654","00:35:55,217","The gristle and cartilage
around your bones, 55%."
332,"00:35:55,242","00:35:57,971","Bone themselves, 25%."
333,"00:35:57,996","00:35:59,599","And your
noggin up here,"
334,"00:35:59,624","00:36:02,610","the old Grey matter
is 90% water."
335,"00:36:02,658","00:36:04,081",Which brings the grand total
336,"00:36:04,106","00:36:09,090",to 10 precious gallons of H2O.
337,"00:36:09,213","00:36:12,489","10 gallons,
which this machine"
338,"00:36:12,514","00:36:15,131",is designed to extract.
339,"00:36:15,507","00:36:18,902","I hope you choke on it,
you mother fucker!"
340,"00:36:22,211","00:36:24,792",My beloved followers.
341,"00:36:25,316","00:36:27,073",Who keeps you safe?
342,"00:36:27,098","00:36:28,285","- Zeus!

343,"00:36:28,310","00:36:29,988",Who quenches your thirst?

- Zeus!"
346,"00:36:34,515","00:36:38,665","You see. I'm not nearly as
despicable as you think."
347,"00:36:39,575","00:36:42,527","- Let the juicing begin.
- No!"
348,"00:36:44,677","00:36:47,542","I beg your pardon.
Did somebody say something?"
349,"00:36:50,957","00:36:54,523",Did somebody say something?
350,"00:37:03,521","00:37:04,954",Release the girl.
351,"00:37:04,979","00:37:06,677",( Me. Me.)
352,"00:37:07,536","00:37:10,594","And who exactly are you
suppose to be?"
353,"00:37:13,119","00:37:14,993",I-I'm a super hero.
354,"00:37:15,018","00:37:18,591","- Ha ha ha.
- Ah-ha-ha..."
355,"00:37:19,090","00:37:23,169","And what exactly
is your super power?"
356,"00:37:25,146","00:37:26,482",I said!
357,"00:37:26,507","00:37:29,460",What is your super power?
358,"00:37:30,097","00:37:31,516",This.
359,"00:37:32,401","00:37:36,082","- Heh-ha-ha..
- Ha-ha-ha..."
360,"00:37:37,330","00:37:40,519","Oh. Come on, son.
Give it your best shot."
361,"00:37:42,075","00:37:45,920","Well.
That's rather disappointing, isn't it?"
362,"00:37:46,337","00:37:47,949",Into the pool with him.
363,"00:37:47,974","00:37:50,870","- In the pool!
- In the pool."
364,"00:37:50,895","00:37:54,001","- In the pool!
- In the pool!"
365,"00:37:54,189","00:37:55,750","Waaa!
Oof."
366,"00:37:55,775","00:37:57,884","- Yeah!
- Yeh!"
367,"00:38:02,350","00:38:04,600","Whoa!
Oh!"
368,"00:38:04,625","00:38:08,073",I'm so happy to see you.
369,"00:38:10,340","00:38:13,012","Oh. I...
I brought you something."
370,"00:38:13,037","00:38:14,699",I brought this back.
371,"00:38:16,518","00:38:18,612",You're the best.
372,"00:38:20,182","00:38:22,813","A reunion, how sweet."
373,"00:38:22,838","00:38:24,728","I'm real happy for you kids,
I am."
374,"00:38:24,753","00:38:27,855","But, unless we all want to end up in
that giant fucking blender over there,"
375,"00:38:27,880","00:38:29,544","we need a plan, okay.
So, listen up."
376,"00:38:29,569","00:38:30,651",I'm going to take the fat one.
377,"00:38:30,676","00:38:32,215","He might be strong
but he'll be slow."
378,"00:38:32,240","00:38:33,348",You take the big guy.
379,"00:38:33,373","00:38:34,741","Yeah, you're going to
have to surprise him."
380,"00:38:34,766","00:38:36,893","- You 2 take the ugly one, okay?
- Yah!!"
381,"00:38:36,918","00:38:39,846","What's the matter, kid?
Are you scared?"
382,"00:38:40,138","00:38:41,259",Yeah.
383,"00:38:41,284","00:38:45,059","Fear is good.
Use it as a weapon, yeah."
384,"00:38:45,203","00:38:47,733","And girl, what is that thing?
A dwarf?"
385,"00:38:47,758","00:38:49,892","- No, that's my gnome stick.
- Okay, whatever."
386,"00:38:49,917","00:38:51,311","I want you to swing
as hard as you can"
387,"00:38:51,336","00:38:53,566","-  at that mother fucker's face.

392,"00:39:01,322","00:39:03,324","Ahh!
Do you feel it?"
393,"00:39:03,357","00:39:05,336","Come on!
Apple say hi!"
394,"00:39:05,361","00:39:07,690",I guess that is our Que.

401,"00:40:56,897","00:40:58,801",Bravo.
402,"00:41:01,663","00:41:05,006","I have to admit
I did not see that coming."
403,"00:41:08,245","00:41:09,983",We won.
404,"00:41:10,322","00:41:11,919",Now let us go.
405,"00:41:13,626","00:41:15,327","It's not how it works, kid."
406,"00:41:15,352","00:41:17,529","You changing the rules,
are you, Zeus?"
407,"00:41:17,554","00:41:20,435","It's my game.
My rules."
408,"00:41:21,979","00:41:23,290",NO!
409,"00:41:23,315","00:41:25,408",I admire your resolve.
410,"00:41:25,433","00:41:28,053","But in the end
you're just a loser."
411,"00:41:30,466","00:41:32,817","Hey, put the kid down."
412,"00:41:32,842","00:41:35,213","Play time is over, kid."
413,"00:42:00,875","00:42:04,476","Prepare to taste the turbo charge
of justice."
414,"00:42:04,501","00:42:06,442",In the face!
415,"00:42:06,987","00:42:08,555",Watch out!
416,"00:42:09,199","00:42:10,941",Whoa!
417,"00:42:18,970","00:42:20,231",Hey kids.
418,"00:42:20,256","00:42:22,873","Now would be a good
time to leave."
419,"00:42:23,193","00:42:25,023",Let's split up.
420,"00:42:42,229","00:42:43,890",Find them.
421,"00:42:43,915","00:42:45,664",Kill them.
422,"00:42:45,886","00:42:49,394","Bring me back
their heads on pikes."
423,"00:43:51,971","00:43:54,347","Hey there, sleepy head."
424,"00:44:00,242","00:44:01,744",Where.
425,"00:44:02,461","00:44:04,193",Where are we?
426,"00:44:04,557","00:44:06,556",We're on a couch.
427,"00:44:06,636","00:44:08,923","Why.
How?"
428,"00:44:08,948","00:44:11,019",You got pretty beat up.
429,"00:44:11,342","00:44:13,626",You came back to save me.
430,"00:44:14,967","00:44:17,462",That was really sweet of you.
431,"00:44:20,560","00:44:22,722","You look pretty good
in that suit."
432,"00:44:22,747","00:44:25,114","- You think so?
- Uh huh."
433,"00:44:25,704","00:44:27,105","I just wished
I could've done more."
434,"00:44:27,130","00:44:29,528","You know. I wished
I could be more like the"
435,"00:44:29,553","00:44:31,932",a real Turbo rider.
436,"00:44:32,724","00:44:34,874","Yeah, maybe you can't."
437,"00:44:36,154","00:44:39,358","But you could totally
be Turbo kid."
438,"00:44:39,385","00:44:40,707",Ha.
439,"00:44:42,674","00:44:44,762",That man in the eye patch.
440,"00:44:45,748","00:44:47,735",It was him.
441,"00:44:47,952","00:44:51,070","I wished I could've stopped him.
I-I should have."
442,"00:44:51,095","00:44:53,376",Instead I let you get shot.
443,"00:45:02,709","00:45:04,305",You're...
444,"00:45:07,331","00:45:09,051",a robot.
445,"00:45:18,282","00:45:19,540",You're it.
446,"00:45:19,565","00:45:22,132",Eh-ha-ha...
447,"00:45:41,943","00:45:44,876","You're pretty human like
for a robot."
448,"00:45:44,901","00:45:47,038",I'm very high tech.
449,"00:45:49,565","00:45:52,587","I thought a robot was
suppose to be evil?"
450,"00:45:52,748","00:45:54,978",It depends on the model.
451,"00:45:55,854","00:45:58,817","Well. Can you shoot laser beams
out of your mouth?"
452,"00:45:58,842","00:46:02,208","Oh. No, silly.
I'm just a friendship..."
453,"00:46:06,197","00:46:11,617","Apple?
Apple. Apple."
454,"00:46:14,125","00:46:15,993",Are you alright?
455,"00:46:16,581","00:46:20,553","Yeah. My bioelectric
transmitter is damaged."
456,"00:46:20,578","00:46:22,840","- Does it hurt?
- Oh, no."
457,"00:46:22,865","00:46:26,117","I'm just...
losing some Hearts."
458,"00:46:27,296","00:46:28,310",Hm.
459,"00:46:28,335","00:46:30,382","What happens when you have
no more hearts?"
460,"00:46:30,407","00:46:33,124","I'll shut down
for good."
461,"00:46:33,149","00:46:36,180","Shut Down?
You mean you will die?"
462,"00:46:36,205","00:46:41,130","Yeah.
Yeah, I'll die."
463,"00:46:59,997","00:47:02,523","Oh.
Shit!"
464,"00:47:03,817","00:47:05,395",Kid?
465,"00:47:05,501","00:47:06,880",Look at you.
466,"00:47:06,882","00:47:10,311","Don't you think you're taking this 
comic book shit too far, huh?"
467,"00:47:10,336","00:47:11,836","Look. 
We need your help."
468,"00:47:11,861","00:47:14,053","Heh-heh-heh.
No, no, no..."
469,"00:47:14,078","00:47:16,834","I don't care what trouble
you got yourself into."
470,"00:47:16,859","00:47:18,937",I'm not interested.
471,"00:47:18,962","00:47:21,786","Hey!
Put that back."
472,"00:47:21,811","00:47:24,805","Looks like you got yourself 
a girlfriend. Hmm."
473,"00:47:27,579","00:47:29,546",Oh.
474,"00:47:29,571","00:47:32,918","Give me that BACK, young lady."
475,"00:47:33,280","00:47:34,594","Hey. What are you doing? 
You're leaving?"
476,"00:47:34,619","00:47:37,478","Yes, and if I were you,
I'd be packing too."
477,"00:47:37,503","00:47:41,867","Fredric, the arm wrestler is gone. 
There's a shit storm coming."
478,"00:47:41,892","00:47:45,807","Some crazy bastard pissed off Zeus
and he's on the war path."
479,"00:47:45,832","00:47:47,418","Oh, yeah. 
That was us."
480,"00:47:47,443","00:47:50,251","Hey, look.
Ha."
481,"00:47:51,191","00:47:52,656",Wait!
482,"00:47:52,681","00:47:54,730",And stop following me!
483,"00:47:54,755","00:47:58,442","All we need is a bioelectric transmitter.
She's going to die!"
484,"00:47:58,467","00:48:01,074",Are you insane?
485,"00:48:02,210","00:48:05,481","- She's a robot.
- Yeah, but she's my friend."
486,"00:48:05,506","00:48:07,565","I-I don't want
to hear about it."
487,"00:48:07,590","00:48:10,005","Bagu, please."
488,"00:48:13,832","00:48:17,863","And.
Why should I help you?"
489,"00:48:17,888","00:48:20,119",What's in it for me?
490,"00:48:23,390","00:48:25,525",You can have this.
491,"00:48:27,139","00:48:28,694",Alright.
492,"00:48:30,925","00:48:35,034","But, just because it's you,
you need to head north."
493,"00:48:35,059","00:48:39,636","Find a highway 64.
There, you will find your..."
494,"00:48:41,839","00:48:43,389",robot cemetery.
495,"00:48:43,414","00:48:46,458","You, might have some luck finding
whatever it is you're looking for there."
496,"00:48:46,483","00:48:48,729","That is, If you are alive."
497,"00:48:49,582","00:48:54,213","Now, that's all I know. 
So, leave me alone. Huh."
498,"00:48:55,033","00:48:57,033","- Thank you.
- Thank you. Thank you."
499,"00:48:57,058","00:48:58,136",Yeah.
500,"00:48:58,161","00:49:02,539","Oh, and...   Bagu, the water,
it's people."
501,"00:49:04,419","00:49:08,217","People? 
Heh heh, nonsense."
502,"00:49:11,309","00:49:12,751","- Apple.
- Look at the sign."
503,"00:49:12,776","00:49:14,243",Over here.
504,"00:49:53,105","00:49:54,729",Apple!
505,"00:50:07,619","00:50:12,135",Stupid-piece-of-god-damn-shit!
506,"00:50:12,160","00:50:15,546","Why does this freaking
son of a bitch"
507,"00:50:15,571","00:50:19,277",always have to happen to me!
508,"00:50:19,302","00:50:22,641","Aww!
Ahh!"
509,"00:50:28,939","00:50:33,148","Okay. How could this day 
got possibly fucking worse?"
510,"00:50:39,522","00:50:41,150",Fuck.
511,"00:51:11,224","00:51:13,171","Hey, there, sleepy head."
512,"00:51:15,456","00:51:17,358",Are you okay?
513,"00:51:18,232","00:51:20,077",I'm fine.
514,"00:51:22,124","00:51:23,807",Are you sure?
515,"00:51:24,216","00:51:26,037","Oh, yes."
516,"00:51:27,287","00:51:30,181","See.
I have 7.5 hearts left."
517,"00:51:40,779","00:51:41,906",Wait.
518,"00:51:41,931","00:51:45,304","How-How can you eat 
if you're a robot?"
519,"00:51:45,401","00:51:49,761","Oh. I can eat, I can drink.
I can sleep, I can breathe."
520,"00:51:49,786","00:51:53,599","The illusion works better if
I behave a 100% like a human."
521,"00:51:54,470","00:51:58,240","I mean. 
'Cause you know,"
522,"00:51:58,631","00:52:02,906","no one wants to remind a human
that his best friend is a robot."
523,"00:52:03,893","00:52:07,706","Well. 
I actually think it's kind of cool"
524,"00:52:07,740","00:52:10,510","that 
you are a robot."
525,"00:52:17,830","00:52:21,273","And-And plus you got some 
pretty serious fighting skills too."
526,"00:52:23,821","00:52:26,040","Do you want me 
to teach you?"
527,"00:52:28,719","00:52:31,433","- Yeah.
- Yes."
528,"00:52:33,952","00:52:38,496","Are you ready to become 
a master in the art of kicking ass?"
529,"00:52:38,521","00:52:40,027",Yes.
530,"00:52:40,052","00:52:44,820","Strike first. Strike hard.
Show no mercy."
531,"00:52:45,863","00:52:47,458",That's it.
532,"00:52:47,906","00:52:49,409",That's it?
533,"00:52:49,475","00:52:52,238",I-break-rules!
534,"00:52:52,263","00:52:53,953","- Aw!
- So."
535,"00:52:53,978","00:52:57,060","Strike first.
Always surprise your enemy."
536,"00:52:57,364","00:53:01,786","Strike hard. Always remember the 
weak points of the human body."
537,"00:53:01,811","00:53:04,547","- Eyes, throat, genitals.
- Okay."
538,"00:53:04,572","00:53:07,144","And show no mercy.
So."
539,"00:53:07,169","00:53:10,226","You know.
Show no mercy."
540,"00:53:12,457","00:53:14,022",Thank you.
541,"00:53:14,413","00:53:18,645","That was cool. 
This is so much fun."
542,"00:53:18,670","00:53:20,891",Glad it is for you.
543,"00:53:25,906","00:53:28,421","I love watching 
the sky at night."
544,"00:53:32,533","00:53:34,882","Do you know why 
there're so many stars?"
545,"00:53:34,907","00:53:37,803","Oh. Because space consists of 
a whole lot of dust and gas"
546,"00:53:37,828","00:53:40,557","that gathered to form billions 
and billions of stars and suns"
547,"00:53:40,582","00:53:44,060","across the different 
galaxies in the universe."
548,"00:53:44,409","00:53:45,561",Yeah.
549,"00:53:45,586","00:53:47,104",No.
550,"00:53:47,129","00:53:49,191",I-I-I mean
551,"00:53:49,216","00:53:53,106","What I was going to say is...
my mom once told me that"
552,"00:53:53,131","00:53:55,808","when somebody dies,
a star is born."
553,"00:53:56,197","00:53:59,108","So when the apocalypse happen,"
554,"00:53:59,133","00:54:01,094",the sky lit up.
555,"00:54:01,119","00:54:03,573","all the souls of the 
people who died."
556,"00:54:09,347","00:54:11,934",So your mom is up there.
557,"00:54:13,977","00:54:17,630","Yup, with my father"
558,"00:54:18,369","00:54:20,603",up there in the sky.
559,"00:54:27,262","00:54:29,537","That's weird. 
I..."
560,"00:54:29,562","00:54:32,624","I never told anyone
about my parents before."
561,"00:54:48,726","00:54:51,337","I'm-
I'm sorry."
562,"00:54:51,362","00:54:54,768","No worries. 
It could happen to anybody."
563,"00:54:57,179","00:55:00,729","We'll fix you.
I promise."
564,"00:55:03,598","00:55:05,433",T-Rex.
565,"00:55:19,042","00:55:21,505",Where the fuck am I?
566,"00:55:26,590","00:55:28,286",Zeus.
567,"00:55:28,916","00:55:30,316",How are you?
568,"00:55:30,341","00:55:34,371","You're looking fine and 
kind of serious."
569,"00:55:34,617","00:55:36,751",Is that a new coat?
570,"00:55:37,523","00:55:39,115",Aw!
571,"00:55:40,218","00:55:42,186",Ohh.
572,"00:55:42,211","00:55:45,130","Oh. That's... 
That doesn't look good."
573,"00:55:45,155","00:55:46,799","Oh, that's bad, 
that's bad. Look."
574,"00:55:46,824","00:55:49,002","Whatever it is, I'm sure 
we can talk this through."
575,"00:55:49,027","00:55:53,757","Were you actually going to leave 
town without saying goodbye?"
576,"00:55:53,782","00:55:56,463","Me?
Oh, I wouldn't do that."
577,"00:55:56,488","00:55:59,202","I was... just going to take 
a few days off. You know."
578,"00:55:59,227","00:56:02,510","Go to the beach,
work on my tan."
579,"00:56:03,109","00:56:07,814","Just, I could really use some vitamin D.
You know vitamin..."
580,"00:56:07,839","00:56:10,913","I am looking for 
a young boy, a young girl"
581,"00:56:10,938","00:56:13,739",and a big strapping cowboy.
582,"00:56:13,764","00:56:17,022","Cowboy, huh?
Well,"
583,"00:56:17,047","00:56:18,822",and a boy and a girl.
584,"00:56:18,847","00:56:21,977","Uh.
Maybe. Maybe."
585,"00:56:23,549","00:56:26,855","No, it doesn't ring a bell.
No."
586,"00:56:29,690","00:56:31,561","Oh.
No-no-no!"
587,"00:56:31,586","00:56:35,124","I hate to be the bearer of bad news, 
but in case you haven't noticed,"
588,"00:56:35,149","00:56:39,104","your guts are literally attached 
to the wheels of this bicycle."
589,"00:56:39,129","00:56:42,985","- This is...
- Ingenious. Yes. Thank you."
590,"00:56:43,009","00:56:44,542",Now.
591,"00:56:44,986","00:56:50,252","I know that you know
where they are."
592,"00:56:51,339","00:56:54,923","So I suggest 
you start talking,"
593,"00:56:54,948","00:56:59,590","- right away.
- The robot cemetery."
594,"00:57:00,260","00:57:03,326","They are at the robot cemetery.
That's all I know."
595,"00:57:03,351","00:57:06,521","Well, that was quick."
596,"00:57:06,546","00:57:08,256",Rather disappointing actually.
597,"00:57:08,281","00:57:10,883","You're going to help 
me put this back in?"
598,"00:57:10,908","00:57:12,536","Right?
Please."
599,"00:57:12,561","00:57:15,475","Do you have any idea how much 
time it took to set this up?"
600,"00:57:15,500","00:57:16,926",Hm.
601,"00:57:17,376","00:57:19,814","Yeah.
I'm sure you'll understand."
602,"00:57:19,839","00:57:21,829","Oh.
No no-no no."
603,"00:57:21,854","00:57:24,155",No-no-no...!
604,"00:57:28,553","00:57:29,573","Aw.
Aw."
605,"00:57:29,599","00:57:32,045",Awww!
606,"00:57:40,503","00:57:41,764",Shh.
607,"00:58:59,627","00:59:01,427",It's a dead end.
608,"00:59:07,285","00:59:08,604",Wah!
609,"00:59:23,684","00:59:25,343",Apple.
610,"00:59:27,334","00:59:30,286",Ahhh!
611,"00:59:54,858","00:59:58,517","I am sorry. 
We're so close."
612,"00:59:58,542","01:00:00,532",It's okay.
613,"01:00:00,837","01:00:04,196","You are the best friend
that I ever had."
614,"01:00:04,684","01:00:06,940",Don't die on me.
615,"01:01:03,482","01:01:06,557","We're here. 
Hold on."
616,"01:01:19,276","01:01:22,585","Apple, wake up. 
Wake up."
617,"01:01:23,377","01:01:25,671","I don't want 
to be alone again."
618,"01:01:53,229","01:01:56,234","I have been traveling all day
and I've developed quite a thirst."
619,"01:01:56,259","01:02:01,051","Would you have a drop of 
untainted water for a fellow traveler?"
620,"01:02:01,514","01:02:04,997","Lower your hammer, please.
That won't be necessary."
621,"01:02:05,022","01:02:07,626","I know that my friend here 
doesn't look quite as friendly as I do,"
622,"01:02:07,651","01:02:12,415","but I assure you, all I need 
is a simple cup of water."
623,"01:02:31,928","01:02:33,854",Thank you .
624,"01:02:36,498","01:02:38,853","Oh, that's wonderful."
625,"01:02:39,206","01:02:41,619",It is exactly what I needed.
626,"01:02:48,394","01:02:51,573","Now.
Where did you get the water?"
627,"01:02:52,035","01:02:54,542","Because, this is my land."
628,"01:02:54,980","01:02:58,247","Taking anything from my land
would be considered stealing"
629,"01:02:58,272","01:03:01,178","and you don't want 
to steal from me, do you?"
630,"01:03:01,247","01:03:04,038","You got what you wanted.
Now, please leave."
631,"01:03:04,604","01:03:07,120",Where did you get the water?
632,"01:03:07,551","01:03:10,165","It's okay, honey.
I got this."
633,"01:03:17,967","01:03:21,050","It's alright, honey.
He's got this."
634,"01:03:36,181","01:03:40,437","Death by drowning. It's a 
luxury few men can afford."
635,"01:03:40,648","01:03:42,349",Stop!
636,"01:03:43,587","01:03:45,539",Now look at this.
637,"01:03:45,564","01:03:49,688","I admire your spirit, young lady,
but your story has come to an end."
638,"01:03:49,713","01:03:52,028",Then let's make it memorable.
639,"01:03:52,053","01:03:53,292",Ah!
640,"01:03:55,960","01:03:58,528",NO-OOO!
641,"01:04:17,112","01:04:20,674","No.
She is mine."
642,"01:04:23,342","01:04:24,923",Stop!
643,"01:04:26,343","01:04:28,745","Well.
What have we got here?"
644,"01:04:30,338","01:04:33,161","Alright, kid.
Take your best shot."
645,"01:04:46,650","01:04:50,893","No, don't bother.
He won't last long out there."
646,"01:04:58,117","01:04:59,968",Fore!
647,"01:05:45,693","01:05:47,713","You alright there, kid?"
648,"01:05:47,738","01:05:50,963","You took quite a dose
of that nasty gas."
649,"01:05:53,108","01:05:54,977",Where Apple?
650,"01:05:59,222","01:06:01,157","I'm sorry, kid."
651,"01:06:23,413","01:06:25,341",Why did you save me?
652,"01:06:25,815","01:06:28,053",I owed you one.
653,"01:06:29,284","01:06:31,990","Well, actually 
I need a new hand."
654,"01:06:34,424","01:06:37,461","Sure as hell didn't expect
to find you there."
655,"01:06:37,498","01:06:40,018",It's like fate or some shit.
656,"01:06:45,737","01:06:47,555","Impressive, huh?"
657,"01:06:49,945","01:06:53,559","- You know what that is?
- Turbo Mega Blaster."
658,"01:06:55,260","01:06:58,606","Sure know your shit, kid,
don't you. Huh."
659,"01:07:03,405","01:07:06,388","I guess you know where 
I'm going with this thing."
660,"01:07:10,079","01:07:13,678","I'm meeting up with an old mate,
and we're going straight to Zeus."
661,"01:07:13,703","01:07:16,212","I'm going to shove that 
thing so far up his ass"
662,"01:07:16,237","01:07:18,658","that he will taste 
his own shit."
663,"01:07:18,683","01:07:22,741","So, kid.
What do you say?"
664,"01:07:27,524","01:07:29,426",Let's roll.
665,"01:07:31,285","01:07:34,520","Yeah, let's roll."
666,"01:08:10,710","01:08:13,828","How does he keep 
sneaking up on me like that?"
667,"01:08:22,508","01:08:24,207",What are you doing?
668,"01:08:29,988","01:08:34,411","Just play it cool, kid. 
Trust me ."
669,"01:09:03,207","01:09:05,852",I love that dress.
670,"01:09:35,963","01:09:39,995","You know, Fredric, you make
poor choices in friends."
671,"01:09:41,444","01:09:46,072","Ah, look.  The arm wrestler 
has grown a new arm."
672,"01:09:46,164","01:09:47,653","What about you, kid?"
673,"01:09:47,678","01:09:51,231","Feeling feisty after losing 
your super power"
674,"01:09:51,256","01:09:56,819","and your girlfriend?
Correction, robotic girlfriend."
675,"01:09:56,844","01:09:59,182",Her name was Apple.
676,"01:10:00,640","01:10:03,830","I admire your spirit, kid.
But unfortunately,"
677,"01:10:03,855","01:10:06,787","your story is about 
to come to an end."
678,"01:10:06,812","01:10:09,164",Then let's make it memorable.
679,"01:10:18,465","01:10:20,932","Well. 
You're the kid."
680,"01:10:21,756","01:10:23,806","You're full of surprises, aren't you?"
681,"01:10:23,831","01:10:28,097","For Christ sake. Will you shut 
the fuck up and let's fight."
682,"01:10:29,515","01:10:31,670",I knew you would be eager.
683,"01:10:31,695","01:10:34,728","That's why I brought
the party to you."
684,"01:10:56,083","01:10:58,563",It's play time.
685,"01:11:02,859","01:11:05,646","Get ready to fight , kid."
686,"01:11:07,005","01:11:09,508",This is gonna get ugly.
687,"01:11:24,342","01:11:25,779","I don't know 
if I can do this."
688,"01:11:25,804","01:11:27,827","A man never knows 
how strong he is,"
689,"01:11:27,852","01:11:31,442","until being strongest is the
only choice he has."
690,"01:11:31,467","01:11:32,950",Really?
691,"01:11:32,975","01:11:35,967","I don't know, kid.
But it sounds good."
692,"01:11:43,385","01:11:46,932","Eyes! Throat! 
Genitals!"
693,"01:11:50,273","01:11:52,771",Nice.
694,"01:12:00,972","01:12:02,766",Ladies.
695,"01:12:33,445","01:12:34,976",Ha ha.
696,"01:12:39,108","01:12:41,648",Now I'm feeling their love.
697,"01:12:50,646","01:12:53,189","Come on, bitch.
Come on."
698,"01:12:58,315","01:13:01,184","You like that? 
Take this, bitch."
699,"01:13:03,942","01:13:07,928","That' it, sweetheart.
Come to daddy."
700,"01:13:52,282","01:13:54,015","Hey, kid!"
701,"01:14:46,589","01:14:48,109",Fucker!
702,"01:15:19,178","01:15:20,997",E.r.r.
703,"01:15:41,335","01:15:44,030","Good riddance, you fucker."
704,"01:16:49,201","01:16:50,797",You're alive!
705,"01:16:52,045","01:16:54,102",You didn't wait for me.
706,"01:16:54,127","01:16:57,378","I'm so sorry. 
I thought you were dead."
707,"01:16:57,403","01:17:00,952","No, no, no. I mean.
I mean to start the fight."
708,"01:17:01,958","01:17:03,164",Oh.
709,"01:17:04,246","01:17:07,400","Well.
I brought you back your..."
710,"01:17:08,404","01:17:11,143",turbo glove.
711,"01:17:14,802","01:17:16,445",Thank you.
712,"01:17:16,525","01:17:18,449",You're welcome.
713,"01:17:26,443","01:17:28,629",You son of a bitch.
714,"01:17:32,059","01:17:35,194","Oh, you son of a..."
715,"01:17:36,715","01:17:39,446",Such a rude individual.
716,"01:17:47,294","01:17:51,557","Look at us, huh.
Deja vu, all over again."
717,"01:17:52,699","01:17:56,665","Oh, and you were right,
it was memorable."
718,"01:18:03,755","01:18:05,192",Now.
719,"01:18:05,217","01:18:08,533","What was so difficult
about that?"
720,"01:18:21,924","01:18:25,303","Play time,
is over, Zeus."
721,"01:20:05,933","01:20:09,894","You know. I really like 
most people, but you,"
722,"01:20:09,919","01:20:11,833",I don't like.
723,"01:21:30,676","01:21:33,886","Well. 
I've wore you far too long."
724,"01:21:36,854","01:21:39,728","So much for
trying to fit in."
725,"01:21:41,417","01:21:43,652",You're a robot?
726,"01:21:43,764","01:21:45,298",Yeah.
727,"01:21:45,479","01:21:47,028",You didn't know?
728,"01:21:47,053","01:21:49,286","Robot?
Ha."
729,"01:21:49,327","01:21:54,090","I am a CC 1-11. 
Corporate companion."
730,"01:21:54,115","01:21:58,553","Designed to create and 
instigate corporate policy."
731,"01:21:58,578","01:22:03,735","Fashioned in the 
likeness of my master."
732,"01:22:05,335","01:22:07,394","He said to me,"
733,"01:22:07,419","01:22:11,683","just before I bashed his head
with his own golf club."
734,"01:22:13,956","01:22:17,188","Remember, you are only a robot."
735,"01:22:17,630","01:22:20,596",Only a robot!
736,"01:22:21,160","01:22:22,421",Well.
737,"01:22:23,267","01:22:26,511","I am the one 
standing here,"
738,"01:22:26,655","01:22:27,940",not him.
739,"01:22:27,965","01:22:30,376","Sir? 
You are very mean."
740,"01:22:30,401","01:22:32,916","I don't expect a basic
friendship unit"
741,"01:22:32,941","01:22:36,945","to have a CPU fast enough to
understand what I just said."
742,"01:22:36,970","01:22:38,611",But rest assured.
743,"01:22:38,636","01:22:43,503","Human beings are
highly inefficient."
744,"01:22:43,613","01:22:45,418","Pest, actually."
745,"01:22:45,953","01:22:48,324",A lot like cockroaches.
746,"01:22:48,349","01:22:52,949","- You are a monster!
- I was designed by your kind."
747,"01:22:52,974","01:22:55,944",You made me what I am.
748,"01:22:55,969","01:22:59,613","It was a mistake, and 
I'm trying to fix it."
749,"01:22:59,842","01:23:01,496",That's what superheroes do.
750,"01:23:01,521","01:23:04,063","Ha ha.
How charming!"
751,"01:23:04,088","01:23:07,163","Would you like to see 
what I do? Huh?"
752,"01:24:26,070","01:24:29,304","Hey. 
You did good, Turbo kid."
753,"01:24:36,392","01:24:39,642","And when you watch 
the sky at night,"
754,"01:24:40,572","01:24:42,857",I will be there.
755,"01:24:55,563","01:24:56,829",No.
756,"01:24:57,582","01:24:59,012",No.
757,"01:26:08,064","01:26:10,480","You did the right thing, kid."
758,"01:26:15,013","01:26:16,832",How's your shoulder?
759,"01:26:16,857","01:26:18,662",She'll be alright.
760,"01:26:19,274","01:26:21,895",You can't kill this cowboy.
761,"01:26:23,771","01:26:27,245","I can't believe you found 
the fucking water source."
762,"01:26:28,212","01:26:30,799","That's gonna save hundreds of lives,"
763,"01:26:30,824","01:26:32,545",maybe more.
764,"01:26:33,023","01:26:35,002",Take good care of it.
765,"01:26:38,077","01:26:40,735","So, you're sure
