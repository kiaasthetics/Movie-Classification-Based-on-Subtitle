in a massive environment,
you need to do it safely.

38

00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:22,679
We're gonna be out
for three, four months at least.

48
00:04:22,762 --> 00:04:26,933
And to do so,
we have to construct this massive camp

49
00:04:27,016 --> 00:04:29,602
that we have been building and planning
for the last year.

50

<i>We need showers, toilets,</i>
<i>we need everything.</i>

53

<i>we don't need to come back to town,</i>

54
00:04:40,947 --> 00:04:45,535

<i>or food, or fuel, or water, or anything.</i>

55
00:04:45,702 --> 00:04:48,746
That also means that
there's less impact on the environment.

56
00:04:48,830 --> 00:04:50,331
So, hopefully we can stay out there

57
00:04:50,415 --> 00:04:52,333
and just be out there
for the whole season.

58
00:04:56,087 --> 00:04:58,548
NARRATOR: <i>The camp is perfectly designed,</i>

59
00:04:58,673 --> 00:05:03,678
<i>but getting it into the bears' habitat</i>
<i>is a huge logistical operation.</i>

60
00:05:05,847 --> 00:05:08,558
So to get there,
we've got these heavy, heavy sleds.

61
00:05:08,683 --> 00:05:12,979
They are pulled behind
either a bulldozer or a PistenBully.

62
00:05:13,479 --> 00:05:16,482
And on top of that,
we can sit very insulated.

63
00:05:16,566 --> 00:05:18,651
I'd call 'em
environmentally-friendly barracks,

64
00:05:18,735 --> 00:05:22,405
because when we're using tent,
we use so much fuel

65
00:05:22,488 --> 00:05:26,701
just to keep warm because
the insulation properties are so bad.

66
00:05:26,784 --> 00:05:31,998
So these will allow us to stay warm,
stay relatively comfortable and safe.

67
00:05:32,081 --> 00:05:33,458
And safe from the polar bears.

68
00:05:33,791 --> 00:05:35,126
Keep going. Keep going.

<i>In all of Svalbard,</i>

72

73

<i>Out in the wilderness, the ice train must</i>
<i>cover over 100 kilometers</i>

74
00:06:29,722 --> 00:06:32,433
<i>across incredibly challenging terrain.</i>

75
00:06:56,124 --> 00:07:01,963
It seems like we're getting towards
the more tricky part of the route,

76
00:07:02,964 --> 00:07:06,717
where it's starting to get
a little bit wetter.

77
00:07:07,385 --> 00:07:09,637
We still have a lot of water
coming from the glacier,

78
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:11,222
so this is gonna be one of the areas

79
00:07:11,305 --> 00:07:13,850
that are a little bit trickier
than the other parts.

80
00:07:15,476 --> 00:07:17,270
So we'll see.

00:07:23,526 --> 00:07:26,529
NARRATOR: <i>And it's not long</i>
<i>before the worst happens.</i>

82

ROBERTS: This is not a small problem,
it's actually a major problem.

83
00:07:33,578 --> 00:07:39,125
We have 50 ton of equipment stuck
in the water, up to half a meter deep.

84
00:07:40,334 --> 00:07:43,963
So I must admit it's probably been
the worst night of my life.

85
00:07:44,046 --> 00:07:46,340
I don't think
I've ever had such a bad night.

86
00:07:47,091 --> 00:07:50,386
NARRATOR: <i>It's minus 25 degrees Celsius.</i>

87
00:07:50,511 --> 00:07:53,264
<i>So the longer the sleds stay in slush,</i>

88
00:07:53,347 --> 00:07:56,392
<i>the more chance</i>
<i>they'll become frozen into the ice.</i>

89

ROBERTS: This could take weeks
to get this out, literally.

Well, this is my little castle here.

115
00:10:14,363 --> 00:10:15,448
So...

116
00:10:17,325 --> 00:10:19,660
For some people,
it might be not a lot of space,

117
00:10:19,744 --> 00:10:21,162
but for me, it's plenty.

118
00:10:21,245 --> 00:10:22,913
It's a comfortable bed.

00:10:23,372 --> 00:10:26,292
For me, very important,
my book collection here,

120
00:10:26,375 --> 00:10:28,544
and then just the stuff
that you need to survive.

121
00:10:29,754 --> 00:10:31,964
I think it's warm,
which is the most important thing

122
00:10:32,048 --> 00:10:36,260
after the cold days in the field,
and everything else is luxury.

123
00:10:36,344 --> 00:10:40,139
So, yeah, I'm super happy
with what I have here.

124
00:10:43,309 --> 00:10:45,936
So, this is our bathroom.

It's allowed to take a short shower
for everyone once a week.

126

And this is our magic toilet.
It actually burns everything.

127

So, all what we leave is ash.

128
00:10:57,239 --> 00:11:00,534
It's, I would say,
quite environmentally friendly.

129
00:11:00,618 --> 00:11:06,540

to be clean and happy, I guess.

164
00:14:14,895 --> 00:14:19,024
JONATHAN: <i>Yeah, so it is a single</i>
<i>polar bear from our perspective at least.</i>

165
00:14:19,149 --> 00:14:21,902
Copy that. Okay, let's go.

166
00:14:48,762 --> 00:14:53,017
STEINMANN: <i>Spotting for polar bears</i>
<i>is like nothing else</i>

167
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:55,811
<i>because most of the time you have</i>

168
00:14:55,895 --> 00:14:58,230
a vast ice landscape in front of you.

169
00:14:58,981 --> 00:15:01,191
<i>And what you're looking for</i>

170
00:15:01,275 --> 00:15:05,946
are these tiny little yellowish dots
in this landscape.

171
00:15:06,572 --> 00:15:10,117
<i>Because polar bears</i>
<i>are slightly yellowish,</i>

172
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:13,787
<i>and that makes them</i>
<i>spottable in this landscape.</i>

173
00:15:16,248 --> 00:15:18,334
I don't see a bear.

174
00:15:24,256 --> 00:15:27,426
<i>There's nothing</i>
<i>like encountering a polar bear.</i>

175
00:15:28,344 --> 00:15:31,472
<i>You feel it. It's magical.</i>

176
00:15:34,183 --> 00:15:38,228
<i>I feel like I have</i>
<i>a pretty deep connection to polar bears.</i>

177
00:15:38,312 --> 00:15:42,066
And, I mean, I'm pretentious enough
to say the polar bear's my spirit animal.

178
00:15:45,152 --> 00:15:46,654
<i>They are unique.</i>

179
00:15:46,737 --> 00:15:49,573
<i>They're out in this wilderness,</i>
<i>on the ice,</i>

180
00:15:49,657 --> 00:15:51,492
<i>and they can survive out there.</i>

181
00:15:56,330 --> 00:15:58,916
RAGNHEID SOKGSETH:
<i>Looking at polar bears on sea ice,</i>

182
00:15:58,999 --> 00:16:02,586
<i>you just know that</i>
<i>this is their right environment.</i>

183
00:16:02,670 --> 00:16:05,089
They are adapted so perfectly

184
00:16:05,172 --> 00:16:08,717
for sea ice, living in sea ice,
hunting on sea ice.

185
00:16:08,801 --> 00:16:11,720
<i>And it's just amazing to watch them.</i>

186
00:16:23,524 --> 00:16:26,777
NARRATOR: <i>To tell the full story,</i>
<i>the team has set their sights</i>

187
00:16:26,860 --> 00:16:31,073
<i>on capturing the holy grail</i>
<i>of polar bear filmmaking.</i>

188
00:16:32,449 --> 00:16:35,744
The most difficult thing
when it comes to polar bear filmmaking

189
00:16:35,828 --> 00:16:37,830
is to film a mom with COYs.

190
00:16:37,913 --> 00:16:39,915
And COY stands for "Cubs of the Year."

191
00:16:40,249 --> 00:16:43,961
<i>It means they have been born</i>
<i>in the winter in a little den.</i>

192
00:16:44,044 --> 00:16:48,590
<i>And, of course, these tiny bears</i>
<i>are incredibly vulnerable.</i>

193
00:16:48,757 --> 00:16:53,637
So, approaching a mom
with COYs is almost impossible.

194
00:17:01,562 --> 00:17:02,980
NARRATOR: <i>Now it's spring.</i>

195
00:17:03,147 --> 00:17:07,568
<i>Moms and cubs of the year are emerging</i>
<i>from their dens in the mountains</i>

196
00:17:07,651 --> 00:17:09,528
<i>for the first time.</i>

197
00:17:10,654 --> 00:17:13,866
<i>And the team's chance to film them begins.</i>

198
00:17:14,825 --> 00:17:17,161
<i>But they have to find a den first.</i>

199
00:17:20,664 --> 00:17:22,082
STROM: When we look up the mountain,

200
00:17:22,166 --> 00:17:25,753
we're looking for either
a very tiny little hole,

201
00:17:25,836 --> 00:17:28,630
or we could find, when the den is open,

202
00:17:28,714 --> 00:17:31,258
that there is a lot of tracks
around the little hole.

203
00:17:31,717 --> 00:17:34,011
Because when the mother
pushes out the opening,

204
00:17:34,344 --> 00:17:38,766
she has to have the cubs learning
how to move and balance

205
00:17:38,849 --> 00:17:41,560
outside the den before she can
take them down on the sea ice.

206
00:17:41,852 --> 00:17:45,189
So, it's just about being
in the right place at the right time.

207
00:17:47,107 --> 00:17:50,944
NARRATOR: <i>Finding a den is like looking</i>
<i>for a needle in a haystack.</i>

208
00:17:52,237 --> 00:17:54,490
<i>So the team calls in some help.</i>

209
00:18:00,079 --> 00:18:04,708
<i>Onboard the helicopter</i>
<i>is a state-of-the-art camera system.</i>

210
00:18:09,797 --> 00:18:12,508
TIREN: <i>Keep this elevation</i>
<i>for a while, and then we can</i>

211
00:18:12,591 --> 00:18:17,137
<i>gradually rise over the mountain</i>
<i>as we get closer to it.</i>

212
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:20,933
STROM: <i>Really nice, Erika.</i>
TIREN: <i>Yeah.</i>

213
00:18:23,268 --> 00:18:27,189
<i>We're gonna go along the coastline,</i>
<i>looking for polar bear dens.</i>

214
00:18:27,439 --> 00:18:30,818
<i>So our crew on the ground</i>
<i>is camped up over here.</i>

215
00:18:31,527 --> 00:18:33,779
<i>-There it is there, Erika.</i>
-TIREN: <i>Yep.</i>

216
00:18:33,904 --> 00:18:36,240
<i>Looks very nice and comfy.</i>

217
00:18:36,990 --> 00:18:42,162
NARRATOR: <i>From the air, they can search</i>
<i>a vast area of inhospitable wilderness.</i>

218
00:18:42,246 --> 00:18:46,208
ROBERTS: <i>Guys, I'm looking at these ridges</i>
<i>for any den activities.</i>

219
00:18:49,211 --> 00:18:51,380
NARRATOR: <i>The technique quickly pays off.</i>

220
00:18:54,591 --> 00:18:57,302
<i>Bear tracks emerging from a den.</i>

221
00:19:01,807 --> 00:19:06,520
<i>When the female bear first puts</i>
<i>her head out and breaks surface,</i>

222
00:19:06,603 --> 00:19:09,022
<i>it's only just a black hole,</i>
<i>it's very hard to see.</i>

223
00:19:09,439 --> 00:19:11,483
<i>But once she starts</i>
<i>going out with the cubs,</i>

224
00:19:11,567 --> 00:19:13,777
<i>it becomes like a spider web in the snow.</i>

225
00:19:16,238 --> 00:19:20,492
NARRATOR: <i>The tracks leading away from</i>
<i>the den suggest this mother and her cubs</i>

226
00:19:20,576 --> 00:19:22,703
<i>have already left.</i>

227
00:19:24,037 --> 00:19:26,790
JON AARS: <i>Most important time of year</i>
<i>for polar bears</i>

228
00:19:26,874 --> 00:19:28,333
<i>is spring or early summer</i>

229
00:19:28,417 --> 00:19:32,129
<i>because that's when they</i>
<i>build up most of the fat reserves.</i>

230
00:19:32,254 --> 00:19:33,881
A female might be in a den

231
00:19:33,964 --> 00:19:36,884
for more than half a year
without eating at all,

232
00:19:36,967 --> 00:19:39,303
at the same time nursing small cubs.

233
00:19:40,679 --> 00:19:44,099
<i>It's very important for her</i>
<i>when they leave the den in March, April,</i>

234
00:19:44,183 --> 00:19:47,019
<i>that they find something to eat soon</i>

235
00:19:47,102 --> 00:19:52,024
because she need to be able to produce
milk for those cubs for them to survive.

236
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:58,322
NARRATOR: <i>All the dens they find</i>
<i>are already empty.</i>

237
00:20:02,201 --> 00:20:06,330
<i>But the team soon discovers</i>
<i>a family on the move.</i>

238
00:20:09,374 --> 00:20:12,085
STROM: <i>When a mom comes out</i>
<i>of the den with her cubs,</i>

239
00:20:12,169 --> 00:20:14,046
<i>she's super hungry.</i>

240
00:20:15,839 --> 00:20:19,301
<i>So the first thing she will do is</i>
<i>to walk straight down to the sea ice</i>

241
00:20:19,384 --> 00:20:21,011
<i>and try to find food.</i>

242
00:20:22,596 --> 00:20:25,682
If we miss this opportunity
to film them in the mountains,

243
00:20:25,766 --> 00:20:28,435
where they have the dens,
we have to change tactics.

244
00:20:29,228 --> 00:20:33,857
<i>We quickly have to get down to the sea ice</i>
<i>and see if we can find any families</i>

245
00:20:33,941 --> 00:20:35,901
<i>that has come down to the ice already.</i>

246
00:20:41,573 --> 00:20:45,661
NARRATOR: <i>The mom and cubs</i>
<i>are quickly lost in the vast landscape.</i>

247
00:20:45,744 --> 00:20:48,580
<i>But it doesn't faze Rolf.</i>

248
00:20:50,290 --> 00:20:53,210
STEINMANN: <i>I'm a polar type of guy.</i>

249
00:20:53,293 --> 00:20:57,714
I love the cold.
I love the aesthetics of snow and ice.

250
00:20:58,090 --> 00:21:01,843
<i>But the sea ice,</i>
<i>as an environment to work on,</i>

251
00:21:02,594 --> 00:21:05,097
<i>is a place where you can't make mistakes</i>

252
00:21:05,180 --> 00:21:08,934
<i>because every mistake can be deadly there.</i>

253
00:21:09,017 --> 00:21:13,021
That's why this job
can't be done by everybody.

254
00:21:13,105 --> 00:21:18,443
You have to be kind of
the type who can handle that.

255
00:21:21,822 --> 00:21:26,743
NARRATOR: <i>Meanwhile, Oskar is keen</i>
<i>to make the most of a new bit of kit.</i>

256
00:21:28,453 --> 00:21:31,331
Okay. Are we good to go?

257
00:21:33,125 --> 00:21:37,504
NARRATOR: <i>This custom-made filming vehicle</i>
<i>is known as the side-by-side.</i>

258
00:21:39,172 --> 00:21:44,761
<i>Fitted with a special camera system,</i>
<i>it allows Erika to film moving images</i>

259
00:21:44,845 --> 00:21:47,556
<i>without any lumps and bumps.</i>

260
00:21:47,639 --> 00:21:52,436
<i>And cover great distances</i>
<i>while filming at the same time.</i>

261
00:22:04,197 --> 00:22:06,408
<i>There are lots of seals around.</i>

262
00:22:06,491 --> 00:22:09,202
<i>A good sign for finding bears.</i>

263
00:22:10,704 --> 00:22:13,123
Seals are the best food
polar bears can get,

264
00:22:13,206 --> 00:22:16,376
particularly the fat,
the outer layer on the seals.

265
00:22:17,210 --> 00:22:19,963
<i>The next few months,</i>
<i>late spring, early summer,</i>

266
00:22:20,047 --> 00:22:22,424
<i>polar bears,</i>
<i>they have good access to seals,</i>

267
00:22:22,507 --> 00:22:24,676
<i>and they build up fat reserves.</i>

268
00:22:25,469 --> 00:22:28,180
<i>Their ability to use blubber</i>

269
00:22:28,263 --> 00:22:32,851
to make their own body fat is incredible,
so that's the best food they can get.

270
00:22:34,436 --> 00:22:37,272
STROM: <i>They need to eat</i>
<i>a seal a week, basically.</i>

271
00:22:38,023 --> 00:22:41,401
<i>All seals have to come up</i>
<i>through the sea ice to breathe air,</i>

272
00:22:41,485 --> 00:22:43,904
<i>and that's why they have</i>
<i>breathing holes in the ice.</i>

273
00:22:43,987 --> 00:22:46,156
And one of the techniques from the bear

274
00:22:46,239 --> 00:22:48,241
is to just go and find
those breathing holes.

275
00:22:48,950 --> 00:22:50,911
<i>Then they will stay</i>
<i>at that breathing hole,</i>

276
00:22:50,994 --> 00:22:54,373
<i>be completely still,</i>
<i>not make a sound, and just wait.</i>

277
00:22:56,875 --> 00:22:59,878
<i>And a bear can stand there</i>
<i>for 15 hours straight,</i>

278
00:22:59,961 --> 00:23:03,090
<i>not moving a single limb of their body.</i>

279
00:23:03,632 --> 00:23:05,467
<i>Because the seal will not come out</i>

280
00:23:05,550 --> 00:23:08,929
<i>if it can hear any movement</i>
<i>on top of the ice.</i>

281
00:23:09,471 --> 00:23:13,183
It's more effective to just sit still
and wait for the seal to come to you,

282
00:23:13,683 --> 00:23:16,603
<i>not using any energy whatsoever.</i>

283
00:23:25,195 --> 00:23:27,739
<i>They can basically</i>
<i>lie at a hole and sleep,</i>

284
00:23:27,823 --> 00:23:30,033
<i>and hope that the seal</i>
<i>will pop up that hole,</i>

285
00:23:30,117 --> 00:23:32,536
and that they will wake up
quickly enough to...

286
00:23:32,619 --> 00:23:33,662
To catch it.

287
00:23:38,166 --> 00:23:42,671
<i>But the sea ice is a very changeable</i>
<i>environment to work on.</i>

288
00:23:42,754 --> 00:23:44,172
<i>It's a platform where we stay</i>

289
00:23:44,256 --> 00:23:46,216
<i>and where we work every day</i>
<i>with the bears.</i>

290
00:23:46,758 --> 00:23:49,719
But it doesn't necessarily mean
that the ice is the same every day.

291
00:23:55,350 --> 00:23:58,812
Our lovely vehicle,
the side-by-side, is, um,

292
00:23:58,895 --> 00:24:02,566
deep in snow and water,
and we can't get out.

293
00:24:04,484 --> 00:24:07,112
(PANTING) Um...

294
00:24:07,529 --> 00:24:11,116
I think it's something called overwater
that we're stuck in right now.

295
00:24:11,199 --> 00:24:16,705
So, there's thick ice below this again,
and right here is loads of water.

296
00:24:16,788 --> 00:24:20,500
And then another good chunk of snow
on top of that.

297
00:24:20,584 --> 00:24:23,253
So, I'm keen to see
how we're gonna get out of here.

298
00:24:29,342 --> 00:24:33,180
NARRATOR: <i>It's 1:00 a.m.</i>
<i>before help finally arrives.</i>

299
00:24:45,233 --> 00:24:47,777
<i>The speed that conditions can change here</i>

300
00:24:47,861 --> 00:24:51,490
<i>has always made it</i>
<i>a difficult place to work.</i>

301
00:24:51,573 --> 00:24:55,869
<i>But the changes are becoming</i>
<i>more drastic than ever before.</i>

302
00:25:00,373 --> 00:25:04,961
<i>Svalbard's average temperature is now</i>
<i>four degrees Celsius warmer</i>

303
00:25:05,045 --> 00:25:06,671
<i>than 50 years ago.</i>

304
00:25:09,674 --> 00:25:11,676
SOKGSETH: <i>Here in Svalbard,</i>
<i>we have seen that</i>

305
00:25:11,801 --> 00:25:17,307
the wind patterns or weather systems,
they have kind of changed a bit.

306
00:25:18,475 --> 00:25:21,478
<i>This has a huge effect</i>
<i>on what kind of air masses</i>

307
00:25:21,561 --> 00:25:23,939
<i>that are brought over Svalbard.</i>

308
00:25:24,022 --> 00:25:29,778
So, this will change the temperature
up here completely or very dramatically

309
00:25:29,861 --> 00:25:31,738
in very short time.

310
00:25:31,821 --> 00:25:35,575
So it can change with 30 degrees
in just a few days.

311
00:25:41,623 --> 00:25:44,918
I actually feel a little bit
stupid today because

312
00:25:46,545 --> 00:25:52,425
I asked the office to send out all this
super warm Canada Goose clothing,

313
00:25:53,176 --> 00:25:54,511
and it's just super warm.

314
00:25:54,594 --> 00:25:58,056
And it's the warmest day we've had
since we came here.

315
00:25:58,682 --> 00:26:03,853
It went from being
minus 35 degrees last week,

316
00:26:03,937 --> 00:26:07,232
and I don't know what we have here now,
but it's probably

317
00:26:09,150 --> 00:26:10,860
just below zero.

318
00:26:13,697 --> 00:26:17,200
It's completely flat light.
You can hardly see where you're going.

319
00:26:17,867 --> 00:26:19,869
NARRATOR: <i>And as the snow comes in,</i>

<i>the low visibility becomes</i>
<i>a problem for Rolf.</i>

321
00:26:25,792 --> 00:26:28,878
STEINMANN: I just don't know really
what we can film.

322
00:26:29,963 --> 00:26:32,090
We have these constant
whiteout conditions.

323
00:26:32,799 --> 00:26:34,801
We have no access to bears.

324
00:26:35,510 --> 00:26:37,971
The environment
is completely inconsistent,

325
00:26:38,054 --> 00:26:40,682
it's changing all the time
and it doesn't change to the better.

326
00:26:41,266 --> 00:26:45,395
What we really need
is some colder temperatures.

327
00:26:46,688 --> 00:26:49,441
With colder temperatures,
we'll have more blue, clear skies

328
00:26:49,524 --> 00:26:51,860
and better, stable weather.

329
00:26:53,903 --> 00:26:59,159
Working with polar bears
is a complete rollercoaster of emotions

330
00:26:59,242 --> 00:27:00,368
because it is so difficult.

331
00:27:01,369 --> 00:27:04,581
<i>But what I think</i>
<i>allows you to cope with that</i>

332
00:27:04,664 --> 00:27:07,167
<i>is that when you work with polar bears,</i>

333
00:27:07,250 --> 00:27:10,170
you always know magic can happen.

334
00:27:16,718 --> 00:27:21,640
We had some reports about a couple
of bears not too far away from us.

335
00:27:21,723 --> 00:27:24,934
And we actually found them now.

336
00:27:28,688 --> 00:27:31,775
The issue really is
that they sleep so much.

337
00:27:34,319 --> 00:27:39,032
See, that's the truth, that polar bears
are not always that much fun.

338
00:27:42,327 --> 00:27:44,621
Filmmaking can be pretty slow.

339
00:27:46,748 --> 00:27:49,250
Wow. She changed position.

340
00:27:49,709 --> 00:27:52,796
Did you get that, when she moved her head,

341
00:27:52,879 --> 00:27:55,840
from that position to that position?

342
00:27:57,592 --> 00:27:59,594
Rolf never gets bored.

343
00:28:03,723 --> 00:28:06,518
This is him at his very most excitement.

They're just punching through the ice.

363

The only way to safely work with the bears

381
00:31:53,828 --> 00:31:56,456
is to have a way
of escaping the bears quickly

382

I think polar bears are really romantic.

They take their time, they're slow,

389
00:32:42,418 --> 00:32:45,672
they seem to get to know each other,
step by step.

390
00:32:46,297 --> 00:32:49,300
I think it's a beautiful thing to observe.

391

(PANTING) So, what we actually
just observed is

392
00:33:20,790 --> 00:33:25,003
that a new generation of polar bears
is in the making,

393
00:33:26,421 --> 00:33:29,507
which is beautiful news, I think.

We have a mother and two cubs.

<i>they're much more confident.</i>

where we want with this machine.

449
00:38:33,060 --> 00:38:34,895
We have to be on solid ice

450
00:38:34,979 --> 00:38:41,068
and we have to have
good ice conditions, snow conditions.

You freak me out.

I don't think we should go

00:39:10,890 --> 00:39:14,185
And I think
we might as well call it a day.

459
00:39:17,563 --> 00:39:19,940
We are spending a lot of time out here.

460
00:39:20,024 --> 00:39:22,777
So, over time,
you see how the ice is changing.

461
00:39:23,569 --> 00:39:28,157
And as you're sitting here, you can see
big chunks of ice just leaving,

462
00:39:28,240 --> 00:39:30,534
and they are disappearing
out in the open ocean.

463
00:39:30,951 --> 00:39:34,622
And we see that our working area
has decreased

464
00:39:34,705 --> 00:39:38,876
with maybe 60-70% already.

465
00:39:39,627 --> 00:39:42,546
That we are much more restricted,
and we have much smaller areas

466
00:39:42,630 --> 00:39:44,965
where we can work with the bears.

467
00:39:45,049 --> 00:39:51,680
The change that we have noticed
in the cycle of sea ice cover in Svalbard

468
00:39:51,764 --> 00:39:56,268
is that the sea ice cover
is coming later in the winter,

469
00:39:56,644 --> 00:40:00,189
<i>and it also disappears</i>
<i>earlier in the spring.</i>

470

<i>So the summer season has kind of extended</i>

471
00:40:04,944 --> 00:40:09,782
<i>with no sea ice,</i>
<i>and the sea ice season has shortened.</i>

<i>with a difficult species.</i>

473
00:40:16,747 --> 00:40:20,751
<i>And now, every year,</i>
<i>it will get even more difficult</i>

474
00:40:20,918 --> 00:40:26,257

00:41:03,752 --> 00:41:08,340
is be down on the ice,
and work, and continue making a film.

482
00:41:08,424 --> 00:41:12,052
But at the moment, it's too windy,
it's too stormy to do work.

483
00:41:12,136 --> 00:41:16,724
And to find the mothers with the cubs
that is extremely important for our story.

484
00:41:16,807 --> 00:41:18,893
We have to be able to search a huge area,

485
00:41:18,976 --> 00:41:21,896
and we have to be able
to scout the mountains and the sea ice.

486
00:41:21,979 --> 00:41:25,608
And it's just a very, very bad timing
to have this weather at the moment.

487
00:41:28,652 --> 00:41:31,947
NARRATOR: <i>The crew work hard to keep</i>
<i>the doorways clear of snow,</i>

488
00:41:32,531 --> 00:41:35,201
<i>and paths open between the cabins.</i>

489
00:41:35,409 --> 00:41:40,164
It's a never-ending story.
Snow, snow, snow.

490
00:41:43,459 --> 00:41:47,463
NARRATOR: <i>They also still have to</i>
<i>collect snow to melt for use in camp.</i>

491
00:41:48,923 --> 00:41:51,717
<i>Forty sledfuls a day.</i>

492
00:41:58,807 --> 00:42:00,976
So the snow is melted here
in this electrical box,

493
00:42:01,060 --> 00:42:04,230
and then the water will go through
a couple of water filters

494
00:42:04,313 --> 00:42:06,398
down to a freshwater tank,

495
00:42:06,482 --> 00:42:10,110
and then we have sinks and dishwashers,

496
00:42:10,194 --> 00:42:12,613
and showers and everything.

497
00:42:13,822 --> 00:42:16,033
<i>Living in camp, it's nice and comfortable,</i>

498
00:42:16,116 --> 00:42:18,244
<i>but there is not much to do here.</i>

499
00:42:20,704 --> 00:42:22,790
STEINMANN: <i>When you're</i>
<i>out there for months,</i>

500
00:42:22,873 --> 00:42:26,168
<i>sometimes you need a way</i>
<i>to release the pressure.</i>

501
00:42:26,877 --> 00:42:29,505
And I think there are
a variety of ways to get there.

502
00:42:30,506 --> 00:42:33,425
-Showdown.
-Head down.

503
00:42:33,509 --> 00:42:36,178
-Am I allowed to use my hands?
-MAN: You cannot use your hands.

504

505
00:42:41,225 --> 00:42:43,894

(ALL APPLAUDING)

507
00:42:48,315 --> 00:42:49,733
NARRATOR: <i>Fed up with waiting,</i>

508
00:42:52,403 --> 00:42:55,281
<i>the crew heads out</i>
<i>to look for bears.</i>

509
00:42:59,743 --> 00:43:03,038
<i>But it's still incredibly hard</i>
<i>to see anything.</i>

510
00:43:05,374 --> 00:43:08,294
<i>And just as difficult to get around.</i>

511
00:43:18,429 --> 00:43:24,226
<i>Once the crew reaches high ground,</i>
<i>their worst fears are realized.</i>

512
00:43:32,693 --> 00:43:38,532
STEINMANN: We got the view of the coast,
and it's a little bit disastrous.

513
00:43:38,616 --> 00:43:43,662
After one week of storms,
the ice has completely broke off.

514
00:43:44,622 --> 00:43:49,877
To be honest, we don't even know
how to operate on that ice anymore.

515
00:43:52,254 --> 00:43:55,716
NARRATOR: <i>Warm temperatures had</i>
<i>thinned and weakened the sea ice,</i>

516
00:43:55,799 --> 00:44:00,429
<i>so the wind and waves of the storm</i>
<i>were able to completely destroy it.</i>

517
00:44:02,765 --> 00:44:07,728
If we compare today to 50, 100 years ago,
when the trappers lived here,

518
00:44:07,811 --> 00:44:10,522
the ice conditions
are completely different.

519
00:44:11,649 --> 00:44:14,693
Maybe they had a meter and a half,
two meters of ice out there

520
00:44:14,777 --> 00:44:15,903
in this same fjord,

521
00:44:16,403 --> 00:44:20,449
but the ice would not be affected
as it is now by these storms.

522
00:44:21,950 --> 00:44:26,330
I think what we are doing here is really,
we are witnessing

523
00:44:26,413 --> 00:44:28,624
the massive change in environment.

524
00:44:32,711 --> 00:44:34,630
NARRATOR: <i>It's still only April.</i>

525
00:44:35,047 --> 00:44:39,218
<i>But with the sea ice gone,</i>
<i>the crew is having to leave winter camp</i>

526
00:44:39,301 --> 00:44:41,261
<i>six weeks earlier than planned.</i>

527
00:44:45,683 --> 00:44:49,645
STEINMANN: If I'm honest, I hate
to leave this place. I love this location.

528
00:44:50,562 --> 00:44:55,484
But we couldn't find cubs of the year,
and we have to move on,

529
00:44:55,567 --> 00:44:57,027
and we have to find...

530
00:44:57,111 --> 00:44:59,154
Try to find cubs of the year
in another location.

531
00:44:59,238 --> 00:45:00,447
So it's time to go.

532
00:45:01,490 --> 00:45:02,825
Let's go.

533
00:45:04,076 --> 00:45:06,453
NARRATOR: <i>The team is heading west,</i>

534
00:45:06,537 --> 00:45:09,998
<i>towards a possible sighting</i>
<i>of cubs of the year.</i>

535
00:45:37,985 --> 00:45:42,448
<i>It's a 10-hour journey</i>
<i>across Svalbard's challenging terrain.</i>

536
00:45:47,911 --> 00:45:51,206
<i>But leaving the safety of their camp</i>
<i>far behind,</i>

537
00:45:51,290 --> 00:45:54,626
<i>the first thing</i>
<i>they need to find is shelter.</i>

538
00:45:59,965 --> 00:46:04,470
<i>An old coal mining town</i>
<i>once owned by the Soviet Union,</i>

539
00:46:04,553 --> 00:46:07,931
<i>Pyramiden was home</i>
<i>to more than 1,000 people,</i>

540
00:46:09,767 --> 00:46:14,772
<i>but in the '90s,</i>
<i>mining stopped and everyone left.</i>

541
00:46:17,357 --> 00:46:19,485
<i>The crew finds a new base,</i>

542
00:46:19,735 --> 00:46:22,237
<i>but they're not impressed</i>
<i>with their new neighbors,</i>

543
00:46:22,321 --> 00:46:23,947
<i>the kittiwakes.</i>

544
00:46:25,824 --> 00:46:27,785
At least we've got plenty birds here.

545
00:46:28,702 --> 00:46:30,204
STROM: Yeah, I love the kittiwakes.

-STEINMANN: New name, keep me awake.
-Keep me awake, keep me awake.

550
00:46:46,845 --> 00:46:48,555
So we finally got a report

551
00:46:48,639 --> 00:46:53,685
that a bear family's been spotted
in the fjord system to the east.

552
00:46:54,228 --> 00:46:57,981
<i>So we have some time to scout</i>
<i>and maybe find the family,</i>

553
00:46:58,106 --> 00:47:00,818
<i>but there is a lot of indication</i>
<i>that tells us</i>

554
00:47:00,901 --> 00:47:02,569
<i>that it's worth going there.</i>

555
00:47:02,653 --> 00:47:05,405
NARRATOR: <i>The area</i>
<i>is only accessible by boat,</i>

556
00:47:05,489 --> 00:47:08,575
<i>so the team loads up and ships out.</i>

557
00:47:19,753 --> 00:47:21,421
MAN: There's a bear.
STROM: What?

558
00:47:21,505 --> 00:47:23,549
MAN: There's a bear.

559
00:47:23,632 --> 00:47:25,008
STROM: Where is the bear?

560
00:47:29,096 --> 00:47:31,765
Yeah, I see it. I see it.

561
00:47:31,849 --> 00:47:33,684
You see the cubs on the right?

562
00:47:33,976 --> 00:47:37,062
MAN: It's the one.
STROM: Yeah, two cubs.

563
00:47:38,313 --> 00:47:41,400
NARRATOR: <i>Finally,</i>
<i>the tiny cubs born this year,</i>

564
00:47:41,483 --> 00:47:43,777
<i>the crew have worked so hard to find.</i>

565
00:47:43,944 --> 00:47:46,029
-MAN: Yep, I see it.
-There they are.

566
00:47:48,323 --> 00:47:50,075
-It's the ones?
-Yeah.

567
00:47:50,909 --> 00:47:53,829
STROM: You see the cubs, yeah?
MAN: Yeah. There.

568
00:47:53,912 --> 00:47:55,539
STROM: And they look happy.

569
00:47:56,498 --> 00:47:58,500
NARRATOR: <i>The bear's huge padded feet</i>

570
00:47:58,584 --> 00:48:01,420
<i>allow them to walk</i>
<i>on the thin, fragile ice.</i>

571
00:48:03,714 --> 00:48:06,842
<i>But the ice isn't strong enough</i>
<i>to hold the crew.</i>

572
00:48:07,509 --> 00:48:11,138
<i>So it falls to Florian</i>
<i>to get the shots using the drone.</i>

573
00:48:16,602 --> 00:48:17,603
AARS: Both cubs.

574
00:48:17,936 --> 00:48:20,397
Yeah, I got them. Okay.

575
00:48:21,189 --> 00:48:23,400
It's quite exciting. Whoo!

576
00:48:24,735 --> 00:48:28,947
Oh, she's on an ice floe.
Wow, that's super cool.

577
00:48:30,866 --> 00:48:33,952
I've got the reflection of her body
in the water.

578
00:48:44,004 --> 00:48:47,257
AARS: <i>Their ability to swim</i>
<i>is better than we thought.</i>

579
00:48:48,216 --> 00:48:51,803
At the Polar Institute,
we have data that have showed us

580
00:48:51,887 --> 00:48:55,349
that they swim several hundred kilometers
without resting.

581
00:48:55,432 --> 00:48:59,269
<i>But it's much, much more costly,</i>
<i>energetically, to make a long swim</i>

582
00:48:59,353 --> 00:49:01,271
<i>than to walk.</i>

583
00:49:02,898 --> 00:49:05,901
Polar bears only swim
with their front paws,

584
00:49:05,984 --> 00:49:08,987
so their hind legs will always
be stretched straight out.

585
00:49:09,947 --> 00:49:13,200
<i>And the cubs of the year,</i>
<i>obviously they don't have the energy</i>

586
00:49:13,283 --> 00:49:17,955
<i>to swim as far as an adult bear,</i>
<i>so they will ride on these hind legs</i>

587
00:49:18,038 --> 00:49:20,165
and just sit
and claw themselves to the fur

588
00:49:20,248 --> 00:49:22,167
and keep in the wake of the mother.

589
00:49:24,169 --> 00:49:26,546
<i>But the longer they're in the water,</i>
<i>the colder they get,</i>

590
00:49:26,630 --> 00:49:28,882
<i>and they can't spend</i>
<i>too much time in the water.</i>

591
00:49:28,966 --> 00:49:30,509
<i>But, of course, with lesser ice,</i>

592
00:49:30,592 --> 00:49:34,096
<i>the distances between</i>
<i>different ice floes will be larger,</i>

593
00:49:34,179 --> 00:49:37,099
<i>and the cubs will have to stay</i>
<i>in the water much longer time.</i>

594
00:49:39,810 --> 00:49:41,770
STEINMANN: That mother
must be such a good hunter,

595
00:49:41,853 --> 00:49:46,274
she is well-fed,
and her cubs are just so active.

596
00:49:46,358 --> 00:49:47,943
It's really impressive.

597
00:49:48,193 --> 00:49:54,491
They seem to be in super good shape,
which is, I think, really nice to observe.

598
00:49:59,162 --> 00:50:04,876
NARRATOR: <i>It's an amazing first encounter,</i>
<i>but getting the ground shots they need</i>

599
00:50:04,960 --> 00:50:06,795
<i>is not going to be easy.</i>

600
00:50:06,878 --> 00:50:10,507
STEINMANN: Now the question is simply
how do we get to them

601
00:50:10,590 --> 00:50:13,844
because the ice is so rotten here.

602
00:50:14,386 --> 00:50:16,179
That's another challenge ahead.

603
00:50:20,726 --> 00:50:23,562
NARRATOR: <i>The team</i>
<i>needs to find thicker ice.</i>

604
00:50:29,860 --> 00:50:35,240
<i>Keen to scout the area,</i>
<i>Rolf and Oskar set off on skis.</i>

605
00:51:00,474 --> 00:51:04,728
<i>But while they're out, the mother and cubs</i>
<i>arrive back in Pyramiden,</i>

606
00:51:04,811 --> 00:51:07,773
<i>where they're picked up by the drone crew.</i>

607
00:51:17,157 --> 00:51:21,161
<i>The cubs are already brimming</i>
<i>with confidence and curiosity,</i>

608
00:51:23,997 --> 00:51:27,250
<i>essential qualities</i>
<i>for an animal that must investigate</i>

609
00:51:27,334 --> 00:51:30,504
<i>every possible food source</i>
<i>if they're to survive.</i>

610
00:51:38,386 --> 00:51:40,680
<i>And it's food they're here for,</i>

611
00:51:42,307 --> 00:51:44,142
<i>an old seal carcass.</i>

612
00:51:47,187 --> 00:51:49,106
<i>There are only scraps left.</i>

613
00:51:51,441 --> 00:51:56,363
<i>But mom would've been able to smell this</i>
<i>up to 30 kilometers away.</i>

614
00:52:16,091 --> 00:52:20,762
<i>It's incredible luck to get</i>
<i>such unique and intimate shots.</i>

615
00:52:23,014 --> 00:52:26,351
<i>But it's still a cruel discovery</i>
<i>for Rolf and Oskar</i>

616
00:52:26,434 --> 00:52:28,436
<i>that they've missed the cubs.</i>

617
00:52:30,438 --> 00:52:33,692
<i>And finding them again</i>
<i>is going to be a challenge.</i>

618
00:52:34,985 --> 00:52:39,447
Our bears decided to move
out and away from this fjord.

619
00:52:39,531 --> 00:52:43,243
So now they are in an area where
we can't really follow them by snowmobiles

620
00:52:43,326 --> 00:52:45,036
and skis anymore,

621
00:52:45,120 --> 00:52:48,039
and we don't really know
where they're going.

622
00:52:49,499 --> 00:52:52,711
So this might actually be the...

623
00:52:52,794 --> 00:52:56,840
The end of our spring snowmobile shoot.

624
00:53:02,304 --> 00:53:05,682
NARRATOR: <i>Now, the only way to access</i>
<i>the workable patches of ice</i>

625
00:53:05,765 --> 00:53:07,684
<i>is via a bigger boat.</i>

626
00:53:09,269 --> 00:53:12,314
<i>Significantly strengthened</i>
<i>to withstand the ice.</i>

627
00:53:12,397 --> 00:53:15,066
<i>It's crewed by a much larger team.</i>

628
00:53:19,571 --> 00:53:22,991
<i>And ably steered</i>
<i>by a specialized ice captain.</i>

629
00:53:31,541 --> 00:53:35,045
STEINMANN: <i>Well, to film bears,</i>
<i>you have to find them first,</i>

630
00:53:35,128 --> 00:53:37,923
and up here in the crow's nest,
in my opinion,

631
00:53:38,006 --> 00:53:42,636
it's the best place to find them,
because you have 360-degree view.

632
00:53:43,595 --> 00:53:47,599
And considering
we're in the middle of the ocean,

633
00:53:47,682 --> 00:53:52,604
and we find the bears on the drift ice
in the absolute middle of nowhere

634
00:53:52,687 --> 00:53:54,231
is kind of incredible.

635
00:53:54,314 --> 00:53:58,777
I don't know how they can
survive out here, but they do.

636
00:54:19,798 --> 00:54:22,801
NARRATOR: <i>It may be</i>
<i>the best place to spot bears,</i>

637
00:54:23,009 --> 00:54:26,388
<i>but there's a very good reason</i>
<i>why no one else is up there.</i>

638
00:54:30,141 --> 00:54:34,854
(GROANS) For a potentially seasick person,
it's not nice work.

639
00:54:36,356 --> 00:54:37,691
I'm so sick.

640
00:54:37,774 --> 00:54:41,361
I was actually not sick
before I went into the crow's nest.

641
00:54:42,404 --> 00:54:45,198
And now I'm completely sick again.

<i>can add another problem to the list.</i>

645
00:54:59,045 --> 00:55:01,673
The fog's just done a typical Svalbard.

646
00:55:01,756 --> 00:55:05,719
It's down on us,
we've got about 50 meters visibility.

647
00:55:06,428 --> 00:55:09,180
But the positive thing is,
is that in the last 24 hours,

648
00:55:09,264 --> 00:55:11,099

<i>warming temperatures</i>

657
00:55:45,759 --> 00:55:48,595
TOM FORMAN: So,
we've just recorded, two days ago,

658
00:55:48,678 --> 00:55:51,056
the highest temperatures
ever recorded on Svalbard,

659
00:55:51,139 --> 00:55:53,933
21.7 degrees in Longyearbyen.

660

<i>compared to 10 years ago or so</i>

662
00:56:01,524 --> 00:56:03,860
<i>because we are getting</i>
<i>much warmer temperatures,</i>

663
00:56:03,943 --> 00:56:06,654
<i>which is just giving us</i>
<i>extremely foggy days.</i>

664
00:56:06,738 --> 00:56:11,034
<i>Much foggier conditions in the last</i>
<i>few years than we've really been used to.</i>

665
00:56:14,079 --> 00:56:18,083

666

-Cool.

WILSON: That's not the sort of thing

670
00:56:36,893 --> 00:56:39,938
that we want to be heading towards
at nine knots, is it?

671
00:56:41,773 --> 00:56:46,820
The one member of our team who's
completely indispensable is our captain,

672
00:56:46,903 --> 00:56:50,865
because sailing around
in sea ice in dense fog

673
00:56:50,949 --> 00:56:53,368
is a skill that none of us have.

674
00:56:54,411 --> 00:56:57,997
You need to have seen it all before
to get us through this safely.

675
00:56:58,081 --> 00:57:01,960
You can get this lovely
kind of thin first-year ice,

676
00:57:02,043 --> 00:57:04,504
which is easy to bash through
with a ship like this,

677
00:57:04,629 --> 00:57:09,342
but if you get into the chunkier
multiyear ice, which is really dense,

678
00:57:09,426 --> 00:57:12,720
that could stop this ship dead,
which wouldn't be good.

679
00:57:15,265 --> 00:57:19,185
NARRATOR: <i>The crew head north</i>
<i>in search of colder water.</i>

680
00:57:20,854 --> 00:57:23,314
<i>And after three long weeks,</i>

681
00:57:23,398 --> 00:57:26,192
<i>they finally manage</i>
<i>to leave the fog behind.</i>

682
00:57:34,742 --> 00:57:39,497
<i>Oskar knows where to head for solid ice</i>
<i>at this time of year,</i>

683
00:57:39,581 --> 00:57:41,875
<i>but he's in for a shock.</i>

684
00:57:43,251 --> 00:57:46,838
So this fjord is one of the
northernmost fjords on the eastern coast

685
00:57:46,921 --> 00:57:48,339
of Spitsbergen Island.

686
00:57:48,423 --> 00:57:52,719
I would expect this ice to be good
for much longer than now.

687
00:57:52,802 --> 00:57:54,304
We are in the beginning of June,

688
00:57:54,387 --> 00:57:57,557
and we see that the ice
are completely rotten.

689
00:57:57,682 --> 00:58:00,435
It's a place where
over the 20 years I've been up here,

690
00:58:00,518 --> 00:58:04,189
I would come to because it's normally
good ice conditions,

691
00:58:04,272 --> 00:58:09,861
and to see it completely rotten
in the early start of June is quite scary.

692
00:58:16,993 --> 00:58:18,995
AARS: <i>Svalbard has lost sea ice</i>

693
00:58:19,078 --> 00:58:22,874
<i>more than twice as fast</i>
<i>as anywhere else in the Arctic.</i>

694
00:58:24,459 --> 00:58:30,340
Now we have several months less sea ice
than we had 30, 40 years ago.

695
00:58:36,554 --> 00:58:39,766
STROM: <i>Forty years ago, we had sea ice</i>
<i>most of the year in Svalbard.</i>

696
00:58:39,849 --> 00:58:42,936
Today, we're down
to less than six months a year.

697
00:58:45,438 --> 00:58:49,108
<i>The scale of that thought is pretty hard</i>
<i>to get your head around.</i>

698
00:58:55,740 --> 00:59:00,495
NARRATOR: <i>Following the retreating ice,</i>
<i>the crew is pushing ever northwards.</i>

699
00:59:06,209 --> 00:59:09,837
<i>Finding solid ice has forced them</i>
<i>300 kilometers</i>

700
00:59:09,921 --> 00:59:13,508
<i>further north than they'd have</i>
<i>to travel 40 years ago.</i>

701
00:59:13,800 --> 00:59:17,929
It took about 30 hours to come here,

702
00:59:18,388 --> 00:59:22,183
<i>but we managed to reach this</i>
<i>little last piece of fast ice</i>

703
00:59:22,267 --> 00:59:24,852
<i>in one of the northern fjords</i>
<i>that we were hoping for.</i>

704
00:59:24,936 --> 00:59:27,730
<i>We know that the ice</i>
<i>will be better further in the fjord,</i>

705
00:59:27,814 --> 00:59:30,233
but we also need to find a family,
we need to find

706
00:59:30,316 --> 00:59:33,653
a family with two cubs here.
Otherwise there's no point being here.

707
00:59:36,155 --> 00:59:38,741
<i>Time to break out the snowmobiles</i>

708
00:59:39,867 --> 00:59:42,495
<i>while Oskar checks</i>
<i>the thickness of the ice.</i>

709
00:59:44,497 --> 00:59:47,083
STROM: We might break through
this first layer of water,

710
00:59:47,166 --> 00:59:49,877
-but it's gonna be completely fine.
-MAN: Yeah.

711
00:59:49,961 --> 00:59:54,132
So there is a lot to think about
when we're out on this summer ice.

712
00:59:54,215 --> 00:59:56,509
First of all, the ice is not consistent.

713
00:59:56,593 --> 01:00:00,930
Some places the ice is 60 centimeters,
sometimes the ice is 20 centimeters,

714
01:00:01,014 --> 01:00:02,807
some areas is only 10 centimeters.

715
01:00:03,016 --> 01:00:05,059
<i>And the air temperature is plus degrees.</i>

716
01:00:05,435 --> 01:00:09,397
<i>So with these strong winds,</i>
<i>it's like putting a hairdryer to the ice.</i>

717
01:00:09,480 --> 01:00:12,984
<i>The changes on this summer ice</i>
<i>is happening so rapidly.</i>

718
01:00:13,067 --> 01:00:15,403
<i>If something happens to us</i>
<i>when we're out here,</i>

719
01:00:15,486 --> 01:00:17,488
there is nothing
they can do from the ship.

720
01:00:17,572 --> 01:00:20,617
The ship can't break the ice in here
and come to our rescue.

721
01:00:20,700 --> 01:00:24,037
We have to be able to get back to the ship
by our own means.

722
01:00:32,337 --> 01:00:34,756
NARRATOR: <i>Despite the risks,</i>
<i>the team knows</i>

723
01:00:34,839 --> 01:00:39,886
<i>this is one of the last patches of sea ice</i>
<i>where they can use their snowmobiles.</i>

724
01:00:54,233 --> 01:00:58,738
STEINMANN: We always look in front of
the glaciers for the bear families.

725
01:00:59,364 --> 01:01:03,201
But on the maps,
the glacier should be right here,

726
01:01:03,576 --> 01:01:06,496
and it's one or two kilometers
in the distance already.

727
01:01:06,579 --> 01:01:08,790
So it's just...

728
01:01:08,873 --> 01:01:12,919
Yeah, it's pretty obvious
how fast the glaciers are receding here.

729
01:01:19,133 --> 01:01:20,927
Hey, over there, Rolf, look.

730
01:01:21,010 --> 01:01:22,512
There's like two yellow things.

731
01:01:22,845 --> 01:01:24,597
-Yes.
-One is bigger, one is smaller.

732
01:01:30,687 --> 01:01:34,273
NARRATOR: <i>Finally,</i>
<i>a family with cubs of the year.</i>

733
01:01:36,150 --> 01:01:37,443
STEINMANN: We found the family.

734
01:01:38,444 --> 01:01:42,490
Family's up there in the moraine.
It's the tiny cubs from this winter,

735
01:01:42,615 --> 01:01:45,284
and we are actually really excited

736
01:01:45,368 --> 01:01:49,163
that we have the chance now
to work with them.

737
01:01:49,247 --> 01:01:51,666
Normally, these families
are very skittish,

738
01:01:51,749 --> 01:01:55,795
so we will have to be very patient now.

739
01:02:00,049 --> 01:02:05,221
<i>It's the most difficult thing</i>
<i>to film a mom with COYs.</i>

740
01:02:06,681 --> 01:02:09,392
<i>There's no place to hide on the ice</i>
<i>from a polar bear mom,</i>

741
01:02:09,475 --> 01:02:11,185
<i>she will always see you.</i>

742
01:02:12,854 --> 01:02:14,981
<i>But if you get it right,</i>

743
01:02:15,064 --> 01:02:18,693
<i>if you are in the right place</i>
<i>at the right time,</i>

744
01:02:18,776 --> 01:02:22,029
<i>it's indescribable</i>
<i>what you can experience.</i>

745
01:02:33,708 --> 01:02:37,920
NARRATOR: <i>Just as Rolf is getting</i>
<i>the shots they've all worked so hard for,</i>

746
01:02:38,004 --> 01:02:40,256
<i>everything changes.</i>

747
01:02:42,300 --> 01:02:46,596
We have some fog coming in.
It's coming fast.

748
01:02:48,848 --> 01:02:53,478
<i>It's very frustrating because we know</i>
<i>that our family's out there,</i>

749
01:02:53,561 --> 01:02:56,939
and now, the fog is coming in instead.

750
01:03:00,026 --> 01:03:01,903
And when the fog comes, it's not good,

751
01:03:01,986 --> 01:03:04,489
because then we can't see
the holes in the ice.

752
01:03:07,617 --> 01:03:10,995
NARRATOR: <i>They have no choice</i>
<i>but to head back to the boat</i>

753
01:03:11,078 --> 01:03:14,749
<i>before the fog thickens</i>
<i>and they can't travel safely.</i>

<i>The weather goes from bad to worse.</i>

755
01:03:34,852 --> 01:03:39,982
STROM: <i>The rain's started, and we have had</i>
<i>a pretty heavy rainfall</i>

756
01:03:40,066 --> 01:03:42,860
<i>that has completely changed</i>
<i>the condition on the ice.</i>

757
01:03:42,944 --> 01:03:46,656
We're driving around
on 30 centimeters of water on the ice.

758
01:03:47,114 --> 01:03:49,534
I've never seen changes happening so fast.

759
01:03:52,995 --> 01:03:56,833
What happens is that
all this water is making the ice rot,

760
01:03:56,916 --> 01:04:00,670
and we basically decided that it's
not safe to be out on the ice anymore.

761
01:04:02,755 --> 01:04:06,467
<i>This is not normal rain for the Arctic,</i>
<i>it's kind of scary.</i>

762

NARRATOR: <i>Snowmobiles are now useless,</i>

763
01:04:14,016 --> 01:04:17,520
<i>and the sea ice</i>
<i>is breaking apart completely.</i>

764
01:04:26,112 --> 01:04:28,447
<i>Time to change the plan again.</i>

765
01:04:29,574 --> 01:04:31,993
WILSON: We've got three bears,
it turns out.

766
01:04:32,785 --> 01:04:37,248
So, hopefully, today will be
a good, fog-free day.

767
01:04:39,375 --> 01:04:40,543
Okay, mate.

768
01:04:41,294 --> 01:04:44,130
NARRATOR: <i>They launch a small boat</i>
<i>called a tender,</i>

769
01:04:44,213 --> 01:04:47,592
<i>perfect for navigating</i>
<i>the broken pieces of ice.</i>

770
01:04:47,884 --> 01:04:49,260
WILSON: <i>It's exciting.</i>

771
01:04:49,343 --> 01:04:52,430
<i>You get a different perspective from</i>
<i>the tender, being lower to the ocean</i>

772
01:04:52,513 --> 01:04:54,599
<i>and closer to the bears.</i>

773
01:04:54,932 --> 01:04:56,559
And off we go.

774
01:05:01,522 --> 01:05:05,610

<i>is mounted onto the tender.</i>

775
01:05:16,996 --> 01:05:19,206
<i>With so many seals around,</i>

776

<i>But while the bear can move quickly</i>
<i>and easily through the broken ice,</i>

778
01:05:33,220 --> 01:05:37,016
<i>the team can't,</i>
<i>and they're soon left behind.</i>

779
01:05:40,019 --> 01:05:42,772
FORMAN: The ice is starting to get
a bit thicker in here,

780
01:05:42,855 --> 01:05:47,443
and we're starting to have trouble
just tracking the bear. Over.

781
01:05:50,112 --> 01:05:53,783
Tom, don't be too close.
You will come up a piece of ice

782
01:05:53,866 --> 01:05:55,576

783
01:05:59,622 --> 01:06:00,998
No, no, no!

01:06:45,876 --> 01:06:48,379
WILSON: Yeah,
it's on a floe just in front of us.

798
01:06:48,796 --> 01:06:50,464
So we're just gonna hang back a bit

799
01:06:50,548 --> 01:06:53,718
and we're gonna leave the bear
a good distance

800
01:06:53,801 --> 01:06:55,845
until we think maybe it's hunting.

801
01:06:57,096 --> 01:06:59,473
She's seen something or smelt something.

802
01:07:05,730 --> 01:07:07,732
NARRATOR: <i>With the ice broken apart,</i>

803
01:07:07,815 --> 01:07:11,485
<i>a bear can no longer</i>
<i>just sit at an ice hole and wait.</i>

804
01:07:12,319 --> 01:07:15,406
<i>She needs a different hunting technique.</i>

805
01:07:24,123 --> 01:07:27,585
AARS: <i>Polar bears, they frequently</i>
<i>swim in between ice floes,</i>

806
01:07:27,752 --> 01:07:30,504
<i>where it's like broken sea ice,</i>
<i>and jump out of the water</i>

807
01:07:30,588 --> 01:07:32,798
<i>and take the seals,</i>

808
01:07:32,882 --> 01:07:34,467
but it's hard for polar bears.

809
01:07:37,845 --> 01:07:42,099
<i>Of course, conditions have changed,</i>
<i>so it's now often less sea ice,</i>

810
01:07:42,183 --> 01:07:44,226
<i>more open areas.</i>

811
01:07:44,310 --> 01:07:48,564
<i>So this aquatic stalking</i>
<i>is more important.</i>

812
01:07:57,782 --> 01:08:02,286
NARRATOR: <i>Once spotted, the bear</i>
<i>has no hope of outswimming a seal.</i>

813
01:08:05,372 --> 01:08:06,707
WILSON: The seal got away.

814
01:08:07,124 --> 01:08:09,043
Oh, bear.

815
01:08:10,044 --> 01:08:14,131
NARRATOR: <i>This technique</i>
<i>relies on pure stealth.</i>

816
01:08:16,050 --> 01:08:18,677
WILSON: Go super slow. It's nice.

817
01:08:35,111 --> 01:08:37,905
It's really hard to pick
where he's gonna come up.

818
01:08:53,796 --> 01:08:55,965
NARRATOR: <i>It's thought</i>
<i>that only some polar bears</i>

819
01:08:56,048 --> 01:08:58,092
<i>know how to hunt like this.</i>

820
01:08:58,425 --> 01:09:03,597
<i>But mastering this technique</i>
<i>may become a crucial skill for survival.</i>

821
01:09:19,905 --> 01:09:25,911
SOKGSETH: <i>The sea ice prediction</i>
<i>is not so good. I think it will disappear.</i>

822
01:09:28,956 --> 01:09:33,836
It is already disappeared on the
western side of Svalbard in many fjords,

823
01:09:34,086 --> 01:09:37,506
<i>but with the continuing rising</i>
<i>of the temperature,</i>

824
01:09:37,590 --> 01:09:40,384
<i>the sea ice will be reduced more and more,</i>

825
01:09:40,467 --> 01:09:44,471
<i>and in the end, it will not be cold enough</i>
<i>to produce sea ice.</i>

826
01:09:46,098 --> 01:09:52,688
<i>In 30 years, it can be a reality</i>
<i>that sea ice, in Svalbard, at least,</i>

827
01:09:52,771 --> 01:09:54,315
<i>is just history.</i>

828
01:09:56,984 --> 01:10:01,071
AARS: <i>If sea ice continues to disappear,</i>

829
01:10:01,197 --> 01:10:05,659
it's likely that the polar bears
will decline quite significant in numbers.

830
01:10:19,048 --> 01:10:23,302
NARRATOR: <i>Polar bears are being forced</i>
<i>on to land earlier and earlier.</i>

831
01:10:24,595 --> 01:10:27,640
<i>And there, these remarkable animals</i>

832
01:10:27,723 --> 01:10:30,643
<i>are learning to find</i>
<i>other sources of food.</i>

833
01:10:31,936 --> 01:10:35,189
AARS: <i>Polar bears change behavior,</i>
<i>they can do that quite fast.</i>

834
01:10:36,148 --> 01:10:38,817
<i>They're curious, they try to look</i>
<i>for other opportunities</i>

835
01:10:38,901 --> 01:10:41,237
<i>to find food if conditions change.</i>

836
01:10:42,071 --> 01:10:45,491
So, what we see is
they use more time on land.

837
01:10:46,742 --> 01:10:49,411
<i>We see they plunder more bird nests.</i>

838
01:10:50,871 --> 01:10:54,291
<i>We have seen that</i>
<i>much more often polar bears</i>

839
01:10:54,375 --> 01:10:56,418
<i>hunt and take reindeer.</i>

840
01:10:57,836 --> 01:11:01,715
I have a lot of respect for the bears
and how able they are to survive,

841
01:11:01,840 --> 01:11:05,052
<i>and it's very nice to see</i>
<i>their ability to adapt.</i>

842
01:11:06,929 --> 01:11:11,517
NARRATOR: <i>This adaptability is likely</i>
<i>to be the polar bear's greatest strength</i>

843
01:11:11,600 --> 01:11:14,728
<i>in coping with our changing climate.</i>

844
01:11:16,063 --> 01:11:20,067
<i>So when the Disneynature team</i>
<i>discovers a buffet of blubber,</i>

845
01:11:20,567 --> 01:11:23,529
<i>they know</i>
<i>it's worth getting ready to film.</i>

846
01:11:26,740 --> 01:11:30,327
<i>Because polar bears</i>
<i>will come from far and wide</i>

847
01:11:30,494 --> 01:11:32,913
<i>to take advantage of the feast.</i>

848
01:11:44,300 --> 01:11:50,055
<i>With over 100 million calories on offer,</i>
<i>there's plenty to go around.</i>

849
01:11:51,724 --> 01:11:56,103
There's this massive, what we now know
is a sperm whale carcass,

850
01:11:56,854 --> 01:11:59,773
<i>that I think at the most so far</i>
<i>it's had five bears on it</i>

851
01:11:59,857 --> 01:12:05,529
<i>at the same time, just chowing down</i>
<i>on lovely, yummy, rotting whale flesh.</i>

852
01:12:06,739 --> 01:12:09,199
It's pretty cool until you get
downwind of the whale.

853
01:12:09,283 --> 01:12:11,577
But, yeah, it's been an amazing morning.

854
01:12:14,705 --> 01:12:18,459
One of things that you have with bears
when you have a whale carcass

855
01:12:19,084 --> 01:12:21,503
<i>is that because they're so well-fed,</i>

856
01:12:21,587 --> 01:12:24,840
<i>and they don't need</i>
<i>to keep searching for their food,</i>

857
01:12:24,923 --> 01:12:27,968
<i>they get a chance to actually interact</i>
<i>with other bears in a manner</i>

858
01:12:28,052 --> 01:12:29,970
<i>which is non-aggressive.</i>

859
01:12:30,387 --> 01:12:34,558
<i>Most of the bigger, older males</i>
<i>will just sleep and tolerate each other,</i>

860
01:12:34,641 --> 01:12:39,104
<i>but the younger bears will interact</i>
<i>and they sort of learn off each other,</i>

861
01:12:39,605 --> 01:12:42,566
which leads to some
great interactions for us to film.

862
01:12:45,444 --> 01:12:47,571
They've all had a feed,
and now we're watching

863
01:12:47,654 --> 01:12:53,786
three young adults sort of sparring,
chasing each other, sizing each other up.

864
01:12:53,869 --> 01:12:55,913
There's no malice in what they're doing.

865
01:12:56,497 --> 01:12:59,583
I think they're just learning
how to be adult bears.

866
01:13:05,089 --> 01:13:09,385
WILSON: There's a set of cubs that have
been on the island since we got here,

867
01:13:10,052 --> 01:13:12,221
and they're really our stars.

868
01:13:12,304 --> 01:13:14,681
They play,
they have a big fight in the water,

869
01:13:14,765 --> 01:13:18,477
they have a big fight on land,
and their mom's really good at...

870
01:13:18,560 --> 01:13:20,813
I think she's training them,
kind of <i>Rocky</i> style,

871
01:13:20,979 --> 01:13:24,733
in how to be fighting bears
because she joins in.

872
01:13:24,817 --> 01:13:27,778
But, yeah, she's really
putting them through their paces.

873
01:13:29,029 --> 01:13:32,074
They play more than any other animal
I've ever come across

874
01:13:32,157 --> 01:13:34,076
in 20 years of making wildlife films.

875
01:13:34,159 --> 01:13:37,371
These bears probably play
six or seven hours a day.

876
01:13:59,017 --> 01:14:02,646
NARRATOR: <i>Even more bears arrive,</i>
<i>keen to join in.</i>

877
01:14:03,355 --> 01:14:06,775
STROM: (WHISPERING) These two guys
just came straight up to our two cubs.

878
01:14:08,652 --> 01:14:10,279
They don't seem hostile.

879
01:14:10,988 --> 01:14:14,491
So we might see that
they start playing with each other.

880
01:14:14,825 --> 01:14:17,035
Here we go.

881
01:14:24,251 --> 01:14:27,671
Unbelievably, they've decided
to hook up and play

882
01:14:27,754 --> 01:14:29,965
with the other two pairs of cubs.

883
01:14:34,636 --> 01:14:38,390
I've never seen anything like this before,
up close.

884
01:14:38,474 --> 01:14:41,894
There's four bears
that are super relaxed with us.

885
01:14:47,149 --> 01:14:50,360
This is super cool, it's very unusual.

886
01:14:56,950 --> 01:14:58,619
Yeah!

887
01:14:58,702 --> 01:15:02,623
NARRATOR: <i>Capturing such a unique moment</i>
<i>is a high point for the crew.</i>

888
01:15:02,706 --> 01:15:06,126
<i>But with the story of young cubs</i>
<i>still incomplete,</i>

889
01:15:06,210 --> 01:15:08,795
<i>they're desperate for one more chance.</i>

890
01:15:10,422 --> 01:15:12,883
WILSON: We've got sun and we've got seals,

891
01:15:12,966 --> 01:15:18,096
but that elusive mother and cubs, though,
still no sign.

892
01:15:19,264 --> 01:15:23,560
NARRATOR: <i>Finally, all their resilience</i>
<i>and hard work pay off.</i>

893
01:15:25,229 --> 01:15:29,274
<i>The crew spots a mother</i>
<i>with a cub born this year.</i>

894
01:15:31,777 --> 01:15:33,779
NARRATOR: <i>They immediately</i>
<i>launch the tender,</i>

895
01:15:34,071 --> 01:15:36,532
<i>hoping this is their moment.</i>

896
01:15:42,204 --> 01:15:45,332
(ON RADIO) <i>Am I heading straight for it,</i>
<i>or is it on our starboard side?</i>

897
01:15:46,917 --> 01:15:50,003
FORMAN: <i>It's on your starboard side.</i>
STROM: <i>Perfect. Thank you.</i>

898
01:16:03,225 --> 01:16:06,353
STROM: We've been trying to find a family
with cubs of the year,

899
01:16:06,645 --> 01:16:09,565
and we've been trying to find them
with snowmobiles,

900
01:16:09,731 --> 01:16:13,193
we've been out scouting 24 hours,
we have been unlucky with fog,

901
01:16:13,277 --> 01:16:16,238
we have been unlucky
with too much wind, storms, everything.

902
01:16:16,697 --> 01:16:18,282
Today, everything comes together,

903
01:16:18,365 --> 01:16:20,951
and we found a family
with one cub of the year.

904
01:16:21,034 --> 01:16:23,870
<i>We just spent about two hours with her</i>
<i>in beautiful light,</i>

905
01:16:23,954 --> 01:16:26,623
<i>in beautiful ice, perfect conditions.</i>

906
01:16:26,707 --> 01:16:29,710
<i>And that's just the way</i>
<i>wildlife filming works, you know?</i>

907
01:16:30,002 --> 01:16:31,920
You have a lot of things against you,

908
01:16:32,004 --> 01:16:34,590
and, one day, everything
just happens to come together.

909
01:16:35,340 --> 01:16:39,553
NARRATOR: <i>It's a perfect end to filming</i>
<i>for the Disneynature team.</i>

910
01:16:44,891 --> 01:16:50,564
STEINMANN: <i>The experience of filming</i>
<i>the bears have changed my life,</i>

911
01:16:50,814 --> 01:16:54,234
and they have changed my life
to the better.

912
01:16:55,527 --> 01:17:01,491
<i>What is so magical about it is you get</i>
<i>the opportunity at this day and age</i>

913
01:17:01,575 --> 01:17:04,411
<i>to capture something that</i>
<i>people have never seen before.</i>

914
01:17:20,677 --> 01:17:24,931
NARRATOR: <i>But having seen and experienced</i>
<i>Svalbard's changes,</i>

915
01:17:25,015 --> 01:17:30,145
<i>it's impossible not to wonder what</i>
<i>the future holds for this young family.</i>

916
01:17:31,355 --> 01:17:34,107
SOKGSETH: <i>My biggest concern</i>
<i>for Arctic species,</i>

917
01:17:34,232 --> 01:17:36,902
<i>in the future, in Svalbard,</i>

918
01:17:36,985 --> 01:17:42,532
is that they will not manage to adapt
fast enough to the climate changes,

919
01:17:42,616 --> 01:17:44,201
which are very rapid.

920
01:17:48,622 --> 01:17:51,625
STEINMANN: <i>When you see this,</i>
<i>you really ask yourself,</i>

921
01:17:51,708 --> 01:17:58,173
<i>"How can we allow this to happen,</i>
<i>that we lose this indescribable beauty?"</i>

922
01:18:04,888 --> 01:18:08,141
<i>If there is a time coming</i>
<i>where these bears</i>

923
01:18:08,225 --> 01:18:13,188
<i>don't roam the Arctic anymore,</i>
<i>I think we lose so much.</i>

924
01:18:18,193 --> 01:18:22,823
<i>All it needs now is a commitment,</i>
<i>and we can turn it around.</i>

925
01:18:24,366 --> 01:18:27,661
<i>And the time for that commitment</i>
<i>is right now.</i>
