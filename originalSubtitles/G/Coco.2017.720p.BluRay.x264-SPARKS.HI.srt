1182
01:03:45,957 --> 01:03:47,989
You will be
my guest of honor!

1183
01:03:47,991 --> 01:03:50,408
- You mean it?
- Of course, my boy.

1184
01:03:52,096 --> 01:03:54,263
(SIGHING) I can't.

1185
01:03:54,265 --> 01:03:56,966
I have to get home
before sunrise.

1186
01:03:56,968 --> 01:03:59,283
Oh! I really do
need to get you home.

1187
01:04:03,274 --> 01:04:06,139
It has been an honor.

1188
01:04:06,141 --> 01:04:08,544
I am sorry
to see you go, Miguel.

1189
01:04:08,546 --> 01:04:10,427
I hope you die very soon.

1190
01:04:12,048 --> 01:04:14,632
(CHUCKLES)
You know what I mean.

1191
01:04:16,654 --> 01:04:19,455
Miguel, I give you my bless...

1192
01:04:19,457 --> 01:04:21,521
HECTOR:
We had a deal, <i>chamaco.</i>

1193
01:04:21,524 --> 01:04:25,159
Who are you?
What is the meaning of this?

1194
01:04:25,162 --> 01:04:27,996
Oh, Frida! I thought
you couldn't make it.

1195
01:04:27,998 --> 01:04:30,164
You said
you'd take back my photo.

1196
01:04:30,167 --> 01:04:31,567
You promised, Miguel.

1197
01:04:31,569 --> 01:04:33,602
You know this, uh, man?

1198
01:04:33,604 --> 01:04:37,355
Uh, I just met him tonight.
He told me he knew you.

1199
01:04:37,575 --> 01:04:39,607
(STAMMERS) Hector?

1200
01:04:39,609 --> 01:04:42,893
Please, Miguel.
Put my photo up.

1201
01:04:44,915 --> 01:04:49,051
My friend,
you're being forgotten.

1202
01:04:49,053 --> 01:04:50,685
- And whose fault is that?
- Hector, please...

1203
01:04:50,687 --> 01:04:53,489
Those were my songs you took.
My songs that made you famous.

1204
01:04:53,491 --> 01:04:54,556
What?

1205
01:04:54,558 --> 01:04:56,189
If I'm being forgotten,
it's because you never

1206
01:04:56,192 --> 01:04:58,060
told anyone
that I wrote them!

1207
01:04:58,062 --> 01:05:01,297
That's crazy! De la Cruz
wrote all his own songs.

1208
01:05:01,299 --> 01:05:03,197
You want to tell him
or should I?

1209
01:05:03,200 --> 01:05:05,600
Hector, I never meant
to take credit.

1210
01:05:05,602 --> 01:05:09,170
We made a great team,
but you died...

1211
01:05:09,172 --> 01:05:11,204
and I only sang your songs

1212
01:05:11,207 --> 01:05:14,207
because I wanted to keep
a part of you alive.

1213
01:05:14,210 --> 01:05:15,944
Oh, how generous!

1214
01:05:15,946 --> 01:05:18,179
You really did
play together.

1215
01:05:18,181 --> 01:05:20,515
I don't want
to fight about it.

1216
01:05:20,517 --> 01:05:22,350
I just want you
to make it right.

1217
01:05:22,352 --> 01:05:26,403
Miguel can put my photo up, and
I can cross over the bridge.

1218
01:05:27,223 --> 01:05:29,122
I can see my girl.

1219
01:05:29,124 --> 01:05:32,094
Ernesto,
remember the night I left?

1220
01:05:32,096 --> 01:05:33,629
That was a long time ago.

1221
01:05:33,631 --> 01:05:35,263
We drank together
and you told me

1222
01:05:35,265 --> 01:05:37,232
you would move
Heaven and Earth...

1223
01:05:37,234 --> 01:05:41,203
for your <i>amigo.</i>
Well, I'm asking you to now.

1224
01:05:41,205 --> 01:05:43,503
Heaven and Earth?
Like in the movie?

1225
01:05:43,506 --> 01:05:46,241
- What?
- That's Don Hidalgo's toast.

1226
01:05:46,243 --> 01:05:48,743
In the de la Cruz movie,
<i>El Camino a Casa.</i>

1227
01:05:48,745 --> 01:05:50,144
I'm talking about
my real life, Miguel.

1228
01:05:50,147 --> 01:05:52,982
No! It's in there. Look!

1229
01:05:52,984 --> 01:05:54,350
DON: (ON TV) <i>Never were
truer words spoken.</i>

1230
01:05:54,352 --> 01:05:57,517
<i>This calls for a toast.
To our friendship!</i> (LAUGHS)

1231
01:05:57,520 --> 01:06:00,221
<i>I would move Heaven and Earth
for you,</i> mi amigo.

1232
01:06:00,223 --> 01:06:03,359
But in the movie, Don
Hidalgo poisons the drink.

1233
01:06:03,361 --> 01:06:06,310
- DON: Salud!
- DE LA CRUZ: <i>Poison!</i>

1234
01:06:08,265 --> 01:06:12,768
That night, Ernesto.
The night I left...

1235
01:06:12,770 --> 01:06:15,370
<i>We'd been performing
on the road for months.</i>

1236
01:06:15,372 --> 01:06:16,672
<i>I got homesick...</i>

1237
01:06:16,674 --> 01:06:18,456
<i>and I packed up my songs.</i>

1238
01:06:19,009 --> 01:06:20,042
You want to give up now

1239
01:06:20,044 --> 01:06:22,511
when we're this close
to reaching our dream?

1240
01:06:22,513 --> 01:06:24,544
This was your dream.
You'll manage.

1241
01:06:24,547 --> 01:06:26,546
I can't do this
without your songs, Hector.

1242
01:06:26,549 --> 01:06:27,715
I'm going home, Ernesto.

1243
01:06:27,717 --> 01:06:30,467
Hate me if you want,
but my mind is made up.

1244
01:06:32,256 --> 01:06:33,522
(DOOR OPENS)

1245
01:06:33,524 --> 01:06:36,792
Oh, I could never hate you.
If you must go,

1246
01:06:36,794 --> 01:06:39,909
then I'm sending you off
with a toast.

1247
01:06:43,465 --> 01:06:44,732
To our friendship.

1248
01:06:44,734 --> 01:06:49,352
I would move Heaven and Earth
for you, <i>mi amigo. Salud!</i>

1249
01:06:53,676 --> 01:06:55,444
HECTOR: <i>You walked me
to the train station.</i>

1250
01:06:55,446 --> 01:06:58,312
<i>But I felt
a pain in my stomach.</i>

1251
01:06:58,314 --> 01:07:00,582
<i>I thought it must have been
something I ate.</i>

1252
01:07:00,584 --> 01:07:03,085
Perhaps it was
that <i>chorizo,</i> my friend.

1253
01:07:03,087 --> 01:07:05,636
HECTOR:
<i>Or something I drank.</i>

1254
01:07:09,060 --> 01:07:10,907
<i>I woke up dead.</i>

1255
01:07:12,494 --> 01:07:14,762
You poisoned me.

1256
01:07:14,764 --> 01:07:18,299
You're confusing movies
with reality, Hector.

1257
01:07:18,301 --> 01:07:21,951
All this time, I thought
it was just bad luck.

1258
01:07:23,339 --> 01:07:27,058
HECTOR: <i>I never thought that
you might have... That you...</i>

1259
01:07:28,446 --> 01:07:30,846
- (YELLS)
- (GROANS)

1260
01:07:30,848 --> 01:07:32,714
- How could you?
- Hector!

1261
01:07:32,716 --> 01:07:34,065
Security! Security!

1262
01:07:34,718 --> 01:07:38,802
You took everything
away from me! You rat!

1263
01:07:39,756 --> 01:07:43,324
Have him taken care of.
He's not well.

1264
01:07:43,326 --> 01:07:48,111
I just wanted to go back home.
No! No!

1265
01:07:49,265 --> 01:07:52,600
(PANTING) I apologize.
Where were we?

1266
01:07:52,602 --> 01:07:54,802
You were going to give me
your blessing.

1267
01:07:54,805 --> 01:07:57,455
Yes. Uh, <i>si.</i>

1268
01:08:00,377 --> 01:08:04,212
Miguel, uh,
my reputation...

1269
01:08:04,214 --> 01:08:07,683
(CHUCKLES) It is
very important to me.

1270
01:08:07,685 --> 01:08:09,785
I would hate
to have you think...

1271
01:08:09,787 --> 01:08:13,820
That you murdered Hector
for his songs?

1272
01:08:13,822 --> 01:08:15,257
(LAUGHS)

1273
01:08:15,259 --> 01:08:18,558
You don't think that.
Do you?

1274
01:08:18,561 --> 01:08:23,546
(STAMMERS) I... No. Everyone
knows you're the good guy.

1275
01:08:29,772 --> 01:08:32,856
<i>Papa</i> Ernesto, my blessing?

1276
01:08:34,811 --> 01:08:39,581
Security? Take care of Miguel.
He'll be extending his stay.

1277
01:08:39,583 --> 01:08:42,718
What? But I'm your family!

1278
01:08:42,720 --> 01:08:45,287
And Hector
was my best friend.

1279
01:08:45,289 --> 01:08:48,689
Success doesn't
come for free, Miguel.

1280
01:08:48,691 --> 01:08:50,857
You have to be willing to do
whatever it takes

1281
01:08:50,860 --> 01:08:54,328
- to seize your moment.
- (GASPS)

1282
01:08:54,330 --> 01:08:55,912
I know you understand.

1283
01:08:56,299 --> 01:08:58,848
No! No!

1284
01:08:59,169 --> 01:09:00,536
(GRUNTING)

1285
01:09:00,538 --> 01:09:03,471
Let go! No!

1286
01:09:03,473 --> 01:09:05,489
(SCREAMING)

1287
01:09:09,180 --> 01:09:11,661
(GASPS AND COUGHS)

1288
01:09:25,896 --> 01:09:30,232
(ECHOING) Help!
Can anyone hear me?

1289
01:09:30,234 --> 01:09:32,683
I want to go home.

1290
01:09:32,835 --> 01:09:35,485
(PANTING)

1291
01:09:47,351 --> 01:09:49,099
- (RUSTLING)
- (GASPS)

1292
01:09:51,222 --> 01:09:52,888
- (STAMMERS) Hector?
- Kid?

1293
01:09:52,890 --> 01:09:55,756
Oh, Hector!
You were right.

1294
01:09:55,758 --> 01:09:58,359
I should have gone
back to my family.

1295
01:09:58,361 --> 01:10:00,929
They told me not
to be like de la Cruz,

1296
01:10:00,931 --> 01:10:02,764
but I didn't listen.

1297
01:10:02,766 --> 01:10:05,766
I told them I didn't care
if they remembered me.

1298
01:10:05,768 --> 01:10:09,337
I didn't care if I was
on their stupid <i>ofrenda.</i>

1299
01:10:09,339 --> 01:10:12,241
Hey, <i>chamaco.</i>
It's okay. It's okay.

1300
01:10:12,243 --> 01:10:14,859
I told them I didn't care.

1301
01:10:16,914 --> 01:10:18,546
(GASPING)

1302
01:10:18,548 --> 01:10:21,731
Hector! Hector?

1303
01:10:22,418 --> 01:10:25,653
She's forgetting me.

1304
01:10:25,655 --> 01:10:28,938
- Who?
- My daughter.

1305
01:10:31,361 --> 01:10:35,796
She's the reason you wanted
to cross the bridge.

1306
01:10:35,798 --> 01:10:39,300
I just wanted
to see her again.

1307
01:10:39,302 --> 01:10:41,985
I never should have
left Santa Cecilia.

1308
01:10:43,039 --> 01:10:45,039
I wish I could apologize.

1309
01:10:45,041 --> 01:10:49,043
I wish I could tell her that her
<i>papa</i> was trying to come home.

1310
01:10:49,045 --> 01:10:51,629
That he loved her so much.

1311
01:10:53,950 --> 01:10:55,865
My Coco...

1312
01:10:57,787 --> 01:10:59,603
Coco?

1313
01:11:15,472 --> 01:11:18,805
Where did you get this?

1314
01:11:18,807 --> 01:11:22,625
That's my <i>Mama</i> Coco.
That's my <i>Mama</i> Imelda.

1315
01:11:23,579 --> 01:11:26,663
Is that you?

1316
01:11:30,320 --> 01:11:33,803
- We're...
- BOTH: Family?

1317
01:11:46,003 --> 01:11:48,703
HECTOR: I always hoped
I'd see her again.

1318
01:11:48,705 --> 01:11:51,104
That she'd miss me.

1319
01:11:51,106 --> 01:11:55,191
Maybe put up my photo.
But it never happened.

1320
01:11:56,347 --> 01:11:58,478
You know the worst part?

1321
01:11:58,480 --> 01:12:00,747
Even if I never got to see
Coco in the living world...

1322
01:12:00,749 --> 01:12:04,353
I thought at least
one day I'd see her here.

1323
01:12:04,355 --> 01:12:06,069
Give her the biggest hug.

1324
01:12:08,025 --> 01:12:11,858
But she's the last person
who remembers me.

1325
01:12:11,861 --> 01:12:14,128
The moment she's gone
from the living world...

1326
01:12:14,131 --> 01:12:18,032
You disappear...
from this one.

1327
01:12:18,034 --> 01:12:19,900
You'll never get to see her.

1328
01:12:19,902 --> 01:12:21,918
Ever again.

1329
01:12:24,908 --> 01:12:28,042
You know,
I wrote her a song once.

1330
01:12:28,044 --> 01:12:32,046
We used to sing it every
night at the same time.

1331
01:12:32,048 --> 01:12:34,797
No matter
how far apart we were.

1332
01:12:35,753 --> 01:12:38,419
What I wouldn't give
to sing it to her

1333
01:12:38,421 --> 01:12:41,370
one... last... time.
