1
00:00:52,526 --> 00:00:54,987
File 82-712.

2
00:00:55,154 --> 00:00:57,237
Agent Rick Dicker interrogating.

3
00:00:57,406 --> 00:00:58,737
State your name, please.

4
00:01:02,578 --> 00:01:04,747
Tony. Tony Rydinger.

5
00:01:07,791 --> 00:01:09,257
Tell me about the incident.

6
00:01:09,418 --> 00:01:12,637
Well, there's this girl in my class.

7
00:01:12,796 --> 00:01:14,087
I saw her at the track meet.

8
00:01:14,256 --> 00:01:16,097
You're Violet, right?

9
00:01:16,258 --> 00:01:17,051
That's me.

10
00:01:17,218 --> 00:01:19,094
I sort of knew her, but she'd changed.

11
00:01:19,261 --> 00:01:21,055
Relaxed. She was more sure of herself.

12
00:01:21,222 --> 00:01:22,389
Cool, cute.

13
00:01:22,681 --> 00:01:23,849
I asked her out to a movie.

14
00:01:24,016 --> 00:01:24,934
So, Friday?

15
00:01:25,100 --> 00:01:25,976
- Friday.
- Friday.

16
00:01:26,143 --> 00:01:27,561
And I went to watch the track meet.

17
00:01:28,562 --> 00:01:31,607
Not long after,
this thing happened in the parking lot.

18
00:01:45,162 --> 00:01:48,624
Behold! The Underminer!

19
00:01:48,791 --> 00:01:53,462
I am always beneath you,
but nothing is beneath me!

20
00:01:53,546 --> 00:01:56,924
As if things aren't weird enough,
I look over and I see these boots.

21
00:01:57,091 --> 00:01:58,133
You two, stay here.

22
00:01:58,300 --> 00:01:59,760
Wait. Should we be doing this?

23
00:01:59,927 --> 00:02:01,095
It is still illegal.

24
00:02:01,262 --> 00:02:02,555
They looked like superheroes.

25
00:02:02,721 --> 00:02:04,390
- We're gonna lose him.
- Oh, all right.

26
00:02:04,557 --> 00:02:06,976
One of you patrol the perimeter,
keep the crowds back and safe.

27
00:02:07,142 --> 00:02:08,102
The other, watch after Jack-Jack.

28
00:02:08,269 --> 00:02:10,312
- But I thought we were gonna go with...
- You heard your mother.

29
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:12,064
Trampoline me.

30
00:02:17,194 --> 00:02:18,237
I call perimeter!

31
00:02:18,404 --> 00:02:21,198
You're not going anywhere,
you little maggoty creep!

32
00:02:21,365 --> 00:02:22,825
I see my chance to get out of there.

33
00:02:22,992 --> 00:02:26,453
But there's something familiar
about one of the kids' voices.

34
00:02:26,620 --> 00:02:29,582
The girl, she's upset
and she throws down her mask...

35
00:02:29,748 --> 00:02:31,125
and it's her!

36
00:02:31,709 --> 00:02:32,626
Tony!

37
00:02:32,793 --> 00:02:33,961
Hi.

38
00:02:34,128 --> 00:02:35,796
This isn't what you think it is.

39
00:02:35,963 --> 00:02:39,258
It was just getting too freaky.
I couldn't handle it and ran off.

40
00:02:39,592 --> 00:02:41,051
I feel kinda bad about it.

41
00:02:41,218 --> 00:02:43,846
Maybe I should've said "hi" or something?

42
00:02:44,013 --> 00:02:45,973
It's not her fault superheroes are illegal.

43
00:02:46,140 --> 00:02:47,975
And it's not like I don't like strong girls.

44
00:02:48,142 --> 00:02:50,311
I'm pretty secure manhood-wise.

45
00:02:50,477 --> 00:02:51,478
What is that?

46
00:02:51,645 --> 00:02:54,440
Have you told anyone else about this?
Your parents?

47
00:02:54,607 --> 00:02:56,358
No, they'd only think I was hiding something.

48
00:02:56,525 --> 00:02:57,860
You know what I mean?

49
00:02:58,027 --> 00:02:58,819
Sure, kid.

50
00:02:58,986 --> 00:03:00,070
I like this girl, Mr. Dicker.

51
00:03:00,237 --> 00:03:02,281
I'm supposed to go out with her Friday night.

52
00:03:02,448 --> 00:03:05,201
Now, things are just gonna be weird.

53
00:03:06,202 --> 00:03:08,495
I wish I could forget
I ever saw her in that suit.

54
00:03:08,662 --> 00:03:10,039
You will, kid.

55
00:03:10,748 --> 00:03:12,458
You will.

56
00:03:24,762 --> 00:03:25,804
Come on!

57
00:03:44,532 --> 00:03:47,743
Consider yourself undermined!

58
00:04:11,892 --> 00:04:14,061
Underminer! We meet again...

59
00:04:19,066 --> 00:04:22,027
Oh, great! Now, he's on the agenda.

60
00:04:37,418 --> 00:04:38,502
Incredible!

61
00:04:39,128 --> 00:04:40,337
Meet Jack Hammer!

62
00:04:50,306 --> 00:04:51,599
Buh-bye!

63
00:05:07,489 --> 00:05:09,658
No, no, no! No, no, no!

64
00:05:14,830 --> 00:05:18,000
Everybody, stay back! Okay? Stay back!

65
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:22,379
You're not sticking me with babysitting!

66
00:05:26,634 --> 00:05:30,262
I can't steer it or stop it.
And the Underminer's escaped!

67
00:05:30,429 --> 00:05:32,348
We'll have to stop it... Bob! The monorail!

68
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:41,482
Frozone! Yeah!

69
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:48,614
We have to stop this thing
before it gets to the overpass!

70
00:05:48,781 --> 00:05:51,283
I'll try to keep it away from the buildings!

71
00:06:01,335 --> 00:06:02,336
Hey, lady!

72
00:06:04,505 --> 00:06:06,590
Thank you so much, young man!

73
00:06:12,638 --> 00:06:13,597
What?

74
00:06:14,306 --> 00:06:15,307
Violet!

75
00:06:29,405 --> 00:06:30,823
Stop!

76
00:06:31,657 --> 00:06:32,449
Everybody, stop!

77
00:07:02,730 --> 00:07:04,523
- Heads up, Dad!
- Dash!

78
00:07:06,901 --> 00:07:07,735
Violet!

79
00:07:07,902 --> 00:07:09,361
Who's watching Jack-Jack?

80
00:07:09,528 --> 00:07:10,529
Dash is watching him!

81
00:07:10,696 --> 00:07:12,364
Violet, here, you take him!

82
00:07:22,541 --> 00:07:23,792
It's headed for City Hall!

83
00:07:23,959 --> 00:07:25,377
Mom needs help!

84
00:07:31,634 --> 00:07:33,802
They're out in public again!
This is our chance!

85
00:07:33,969 --> 00:07:36,013
Follow them, follow Frozone!

86
00:07:49,902 --> 00:07:52,821
Bob! Help me with the boiler!

87
00:08:09,380 --> 00:08:10,839
That should do it!

88
00:08:11,006 --> 00:08:12,841
What are you kids doing? Get out of here!

89
00:08:13,008 --> 00:08:14,218
This thing's gonna blow!

90
00:08:14,385 --> 00:08:15,928
There's no time!

91
00:08:27,898 --> 00:08:29,733
We did it!

92
00:08:29,900 --> 00:08:30,860
Freeze, Supers!

93
00:08:31,735 --> 00:08:33,612
What did we do?

94
00:08:37,658 --> 00:08:40,244
Excuse me, Mr. Zone?

95
00:08:42,371 --> 00:08:45,207
Sorry, but I'm not really
supposed to be here.

96
00:08:45,374 --> 00:08:47,042
Which seems wrong...

97
00:08:47,209 --> 00:08:48,377
doesn't it?

98
00:08:48,544 --> 00:08:52,131
Perhaps you'd be interested in
changing that law?

99
00:08:53,632 --> 00:08:57,219
Superheroes including
Frozone, Mr. Incredible, and Elastigirl...

100
00:08:57,386 --> 00:08:59,471
caused further damage to the city.

101
00:08:59,638 --> 00:09:01,682
The Underminer remains at large.

102
00:09:01,849 --> 00:09:03,475
We didn't start this fight.

103
00:09:03,642 --> 00:09:04,602
Well, you didn't finish it either!

104
00:09:04,768 --> 00:09:07,062
Did you stop the Underminer
from inflicting more damage?

105
00:09:07,229 --> 00:09:09,648
- No.
- Did you stop him from robbing the banks?

106
00:09:09,815 --> 00:09:11,400
- No.
- Did you catch him?

107
00:09:11,567 --> 00:09:12,443
No.

108
00:09:12,610 --> 00:09:13,611
The banks were insured.

109
00:09:13,777 --> 00:09:16,238
We have infrastructure in place
to deal with these matters.

110
00:09:16,405 --> 00:09:18,073
If you had simply done nothing...

111
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:20,993
everything would now be proceeding
in an orderly fashion.

112
00:09:21,202 --> 00:09:23,454
You'd have preferred we do nothing?

113
00:09:23,621 --> 00:09:25,164
Without a doubt.

114
00:09:29,418 --> 00:09:30,794
You weren't much help.

115
00:09:30,961 --> 00:09:32,838
Do you want out of the hole?

116
00:09:33,005 --> 00:09:36,008
First you gotta put down the shovel.

117
00:09:38,886 --> 00:09:40,888
Well, that went poorly.

118
00:09:41,764 --> 00:09:47,228
Dad, this is probably not the best time
to tell you about this...

119
00:09:47,394 --> 00:09:50,231
but something else
happened today with a kid...

120
00:09:51,190 --> 00:09:53,067
and my mask.

121
00:10:06,539 --> 00:10:10,459
Hey, Rick. Violet thinks a friend of hers,
a kid named Tony...

122
00:10:10,626 --> 00:10:13,379
might have seen her in the outfit,
without her mask.

123
00:10:13,546 --> 00:10:15,422
- Talkative type?
- Don't know.

124
00:10:15,589 --> 00:10:16,840
Last name is Rydinger.

125
00:10:17,007 --> 00:10:19,093
Tony Rydinger.

126
00:10:19,260 --> 00:10:20,844
I'll check it out.

127
00:10:21,011 --> 00:10:22,346
Bob, Helen...

128
00:10:22,513 --> 00:10:24,932
a word if you don't mind.

129
00:10:26,225 --> 00:10:27,810
The program's been shut down.

130
00:10:27,977 --> 00:10:29,103
What?

131
00:10:29,645 --> 00:10:31,230
Politicians don't understand people...

132
00:10:31,397 --> 00:10:34,525
who do good simply because it's right.

133
00:10:34,692 --> 00:10:36,318
It makes 'em nervous.

134
00:10:36,485 --> 00:10:39,029
They've been gunning for Supers for years.

135
00:10:39,196 --> 00:10:41,323
Today was all they needed.

136
00:10:41,615 --> 00:10:43,284
Anyway...

137
00:10:43,450 --> 00:10:44,618
I'm done.

138
00:10:44,785 --> 00:10:48,247
I'm afraid two more weeks in the motel
is the best I can do for ya.

139
00:10:48,414 --> 00:10:49,456
It ain't much.

140
00:10:49,623 --> 00:10:50,666
You've done plenty, Rick.

141
00:10:50,833 --> 00:10:52,418
We won't forget.

142
00:10:52,585 --> 00:10:56,046
Well, it has been a great honor
working with you good people.

143
00:10:56,213 --> 00:10:58,549
Thanks for everything, and good luck.

144
00:10:58,716 --> 00:11:01,010
Yeah. You, too.

145
00:11:15,316 --> 00:11:17,109
Did you wash your hands?

146
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:20,905
With soap?

147
00:11:22,531 --> 00:11:24,491
Did you dry them?

148
00:11:28,454 --> 00:11:29,288
What?

149
00:11:29,455 --> 00:11:33,083
Is this all vegetables?
Who ordered all vegetables?

150
00:11:33,250 --> 00:11:35,419
I did. They're good
and you're going to have some.

151
00:11:36,337 --> 00:11:39,298
- Are we going to talk about it?
- What?

152
00:11:39,465 --> 00:11:41,258
The elephant in the room.

153
00:11:41,425 --> 00:11:42,301
What elephant?

154
00:11:42,468 --> 00:11:43,677
I guess not then.

155
00:11:43,844 --> 00:11:44,762
You're referring to today.

156
00:11:44,929 --> 00:11:46,680
Yeah, what's the deal with today?

157
00:11:46,847 --> 00:11:48,098
We all made mistakes.

158
00:11:48,265 --> 00:11:51,143
For example, you kids
were supposed to watch Jack-Jack.

159
00:11:51,310 --> 00:11:54,522
Babysitting, while you guys
did the important stuff.

160
00:11:54,688 --> 00:11:55,523
We talked about this.

161
00:11:55,689 --> 00:11:57,483
You're not old enough to decide
about these things.

162
00:11:57,650 --> 00:11:59,568
- We are old enough to help out.
- Yeah!

163
00:11:59,735 --> 00:12:01,529
Isn't that what you tell us, Dad?

164
00:12:01,695 --> 00:12:04,990
Yeah, well, "help out"
can mean many different things.

165
00:12:05,157 --> 00:12:06,742
But we're supposed to help,
if there's trouble.

166
00:12:06,909 --> 00:12:07,743
Well, yeah, but...

167
00:12:07,910 --> 00:12:09,787
- Aren't you glad we helped today?
- Yeah, I know but...

168
00:12:09,954 --> 00:12:10,955
You said that you were proud of us.

169
00:12:11,121 --> 00:12:12,790
Well, yeah, I was. Am!

170
00:12:12,957 --> 00:12:14,416
We wanna fight bad guys!

171
00:12:15,417 --> 00:12:16,752
No, you don't!

172
00:12:17,586 --> 00:12:19,463
You said things were different now.

173
00:12:19,630 --> 00:12:21,799
And they were, on the island.

174
00:12:21,966 --> 00:12:23,467
But I didn't mean that from now on...

175
00:12:23,634 --> 00:12:26,136
So now, we've gotta go back to
never using our powers.

176
00:12:26,303 --> 00:12:27,596
It defines who I am.

177
00:12:27,763 --> 00:12:29,306
We're not saying you have...

178
00:12:29,473 --> 00:12:31,350
- What?
- Someone on TV said it.

179
00:12:31,517 --> 00:12:32,935
Can we just eat?

180
00:12:33,102 --> 00:12:35,729
The dinner, while it's hot?

181
00:12:35,896 --> 00:12:37,398
Did we do something wrong?

182
00:12:37,565 --> 00:12:38,858
- Yes.
- No.

183
00:12:39,024 --> 00:12:41,277
We didn't do anything wrong.

184
00:12:41,443 --> 00:12:45,531
Superheroes are illegal.
Whether it's fair or not, that's the law.

185
00:12:45,698 --> 00:12:48,576
The law should be fair.
What are we teaching our kids?

186
00:12:48,742 --> 00:12:49,660
To respect the law!

187
00:12:49,827 --> 00:12:51,412
Even when the law is disrespectful?

188
00:12:51,579 --> 00:12:54,123
If laws are unjust, there are laws
to change them!

189
00:12:54,290 --> 00:12:55,416
Otherwise, it's chaos!

190
00:12:55,583 --> 00:12:57,459
Which is exactly what we have!

191
00:13:03,632 --> 00:13:05,551
I just thought it was kinda cool.

192
00:13:05,718 --> 00:13:06,552
What was?

193
00:13:06,719 --> 00:13:09,430
Fighting crime as a family.

194
00:13:10,681 --> 00:13:12,349
It was cool.

195
00:13:12,975 --> 00:13:15,644
But it's over. The world is what it is.

196
00:13:15,811 --> 00:13:17,813
We have to adapt.

197
00:13:17,980 --> 00:13:19,565
Are things bad?

198
00:13:19,732 --> 00:13:21,192
Things are fine.

199
00:13:22,526 --> 00:13:23,652
May I be excused?

200
00:13:27,865 --> 00:13:29,867
How much longer in the motel, Dad?

201
00:13:31,827 --> 00:13:33,621
Not much longer, honey.

202
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:41,921
What are we gonna do?

203
00:13:42,087 --> 00:13:43,547
I don't know.

204
00:13:43,923 --> 00:13:45,299
Maybe Dicker will find something?

205
00:13:45,466 --> 00:13:46,759
Dicker is done, Bob.

206
00:13:46,926 --> 00:13:50,012
Any thought we had
about being Supers again is fantasy.

207
00:13:50,179 --> 00:13:51,722
One of us has gotta get a job.

208
00:13:51,889 --> 00:13:53,015
One of us?

209
00:13:53,182 --> 00:13:55,142
You did a long stint at Insuricare.

210
00:13:55,309 --> 00:13:56,894
Hated every minute of it.

211
00:13:57,061 --> 00:13:58,729
I know it was hard on you.

212
00:13:58,896 --> 00:14:01,649
Maybe it's my turn in the private sector
and you take care of the kids...

213
00:14:01,815 --> 00:14:04,777
No, I'm doing this. I need to do this.

214
00:14:05,861 --> 00:14:07,655
You know where my suit and ties are?

215
00:14:07,821 --> 00:14:08,822
Burned up when...

216
00:14:08,989 --> 00:14:10,908
The jet destroyed our house.

217
00:14:11,075 --> 00:14:12,451
Yeah.

218
00:14:12,660 --> 00:14:15,037
We can't count on anyone else now, Bob.

219
00:14:15,204 --> 00:14:17,665
It's just us. We can't wait for...

220
00:14:26,549 --> 00:14:28,551
No lifeguard on duty!

221
00:14:28,717 --> 00:14:30,177
Swim at your own risk.

222
00:14:30,344 --> 00:14:31,720
Where'd you go today?

223
00:14:31,887 --> 00:14:33,973
I noticed you missed all the fun.

224
00:14:34,139 --> 00:14:36,684
Don't be mad because I know
when to leave a party.

225
00:14:36,851 --> 00:14:38,227
I'm just as illegal as you guys.

226
00:14:38,394 --> 00:14:40,938
Besides, I knew the cops would let you go.

227
00:14:41,105 --> 00:14:42,606
Yeah, in spite of Bob's best efforts.

228
00:14:42,773 --> 00:14:44,275
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

229
00:14:44,441 --> 00:14:47,069
I heard the program shut down.

230
00:14:47,236 --> 00:14:48,946
How much longer are you in this motel?

231
00:14:49,113 --> 00:14:50,239
Two weeks.

232
00:14:50,406 --> 00:14:52,032
Now, you know the offer still stands.

233
00:14:52,199 --> 00:14:54,410
You're very generous,
but there are five of us.

234
00:14:54,577 --> 00:14:56,120
We wouldn't do that to you and Honey.

235
00:14:56,287 --> 00:14:57,746
Well, door's always open.

236
00:14:57,913 --> 00:15:00,040
You know, the news isn't all bad.

237
00:15:00,207 --> 00:15:02,877
While you guys were being detained...

238
00:15:03,043 --> 00:15:06,630
I was approached by a dude
who represents this tycoon.

239
00:15:06,797 --> 00:15:08,757
- Winston Deavor.
- Wants to talk...

240
00:15:08,924 --> 00:15:12,094
with me, with you two, about hero stuff.

241
00:15:12,469 --> 00:15:13,429
I checked him out.

242
00:15:13,596 --> 00:15:16,390
He's legit. Trained under Dicker.
He wants to meet.

243
00:15:16,557 --> 00:15:18,601
Jeez! More superhero trouble.

244
00:15:18,767 --> 00:15:20,644
We just came from the police station, Lucius.

245
00:15:20,811 --> 00:15:21,645
When?

246
00:15:21,812 --> 00:15:23,606
Tonight. I'm going there now.

247
00:15:24,607 --> 00:15:26,233
You enjoy, I'm sitting this one out.

248
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:27,902
He wants all three of us.

249
00:15:28,068 --> 00:15:31,572
Honey, let's just at least
hear what he has to say.

250
00:15:31,739 --> 00:15:34,200
You got the address,
I'll meet you guys there.

251
00:15:34,366 --> 00:15:36,368
Go in our Supersuits?

252
00:15:36,535 --> 00:15:37,828
Yeah.

253
00:15:38,204 --> 00:15:40,456
Might wanna wear the old Supersuits.

254
00:15:40,623 --> 00:15:43,459
Got a feeling he's nostalgic.

255
00:15:47,046 --> 00:15:48,964
Where are you going?

256
00:15:49,131 --> 00:15:51,467
The fresh air is especially good tonight.

257
00:15:51,634 --> 00:15:52,635
If Jack-Jack wakes up...

258
00:15:52,801 --> 00:15:54,386
I know the drill.

259
00:16:04,271 --> 00:16:07,816
Your security badges. Please, this way.

260
00:16:07,983 --> 00:16:09,276
Hey, listen, you're my biggest fan.

261
00:16:09,443 --> 00:16:10,444
Good to see you.

262
00:16:10,611 --> 00:16:12,404
I'm your biggest fan.

263
00:16:12,571 --> 00:16:13,322
Shoot!

264
00:16:36,679 --> 00:16:39,932
I love superheroes!

265
00:16:40,099 --> 00:16:42,226
The powers, the costumes...

266
00:16:42,393 --> 00:16:43,936
the mythic struggles.

267
00:16:44,103 --> 00:16:46,105
Winston Deavor. You can call me Win.

268
00:16:46,272 --> 00:16:47,481
Genuine pleasure to meet you.

269
00:16:47,648 --> 00:16:49,191
- Frozone!
- It's good to see you.

270
00:16:49,358 --> 00:16:50,734
- Elastigirl.
- Nice to meet you.

271
00:16:50,901 --> 00:16:52,736
- Mr. Incredible!
- Hello.

272
00:16:52,903 --> 00:16:55,656
Mr. Incredible, Incredible

273
00:16:55,823 --> 00:16:56,991
Incredible

274
00:16:57,157 --> 00:17:00,703
Catching the bad guys
Pow, pow, pow

275
00:17:01,245 --> 00:17:03,664
Who's the cat who's always chill

276
00:17:03,831 --> 00:17:07,209
When survival odds are close to nil

277
00:17:07,376 --> 00:17:10,421
Frozone
Frozone

278
00:17:11,046 --> 00:17:12,715
Frozone

279
00:17:12,882 --> 00:17:14,133
Yeah!

280
00:17:14,300 --> 00:17:16,802
Can't tell you what a thrill this is.
And this...

281
00:17:16,969 --> 00:17:20,764
Hello there, superheroes.
I'm so sorry I'm late.

282
00:17:20,931 --> 00:17:22,850
...is my tardy sister, Evelyn.

283
00:17:23,017 --> 00:17:26,353
And I'm scolding myself
so you don't have to, Winston!

284
00:17:26,687 --> 00:17:27,688
Spectacular.

285
00:17:28,189 --> 00:17:33,360
My father was so proud that I
was even remotely connected to you guys.

286
00:17:33,527 --> 00:17:35,696
He used to call you the last line of defense.

287
00:17:35,863 --> 00:17:37,615
He was your top supporter.

288
00:17:37,781 --> 00:17:40,034
He donated to superhero causes.

289
00:17:40,201 --> 00:17:43,329
He raised money
for the Dynaguy statue in Avery Park.

290
00:17:43,495 --> 00:17:45,331
He got to know many Supers personally.

291
00:17:45,497 --> 00:17:50,127
Even installed a phone with direct lines
to Gazerbeam and Fironic...

292
00:17:50,294 --> 00:17:51,754
in case of emergencies.

293
00:17:51,921 --> 00:17:54,340
He loved that, showed it off to everyone.

294
00:17:54,506 --> 00:17:57,259
He was heartbroken when you
were all forced to go underground.

295
00:17:57,426 --> 00:18:00,846
Father believed the world
would become more dangerous without you.

296
00:18:02,223 --> 00:18:04,183
He didn't know how right he was.

297
00:18:05,226 --> 00:18:06,644
There was a break-in.

298
00:18:08,646 --> 00:18:12,525
My father called Gazerbeam. The direct line.

299
00:18:13,108 --> 00:18:14,109
No answer.

300
00:18:14,276 --> 00:18:17,112
He called Fironic, no answer.

301
00:18:17,279 --> 00:18:19,532
Superheroes had just been made illegal...

302
00:18:20,449 --> 00:18:22,368
The robbers discovered him on the phone...

303
00:18:22,535 --> 00:18:23,869
and shot him.

304
00:18:25,538 --> 00:18:26,956
So...

305
00:18:27,957 --> 00:18:28,958
It must've been hard.

306
00:18:29,124 --> 00:18:30,584
Especially for Mother.

307
00:18:30,751 --> 00:18:33,837
She died a few months later. Heartbreak.

308
00:18:34,004 --> 00:18:36,632
If superheroes
had not been forced underground...

309
00:18:36,799 --> 00:18:38,008
it never would've happened.

310
00:18:38,175 --> 00:18:41,679
Or Dad could've taken Mom to the safe room
as soon as he knew there was trouble.

311
00:18:41,845 --> 00:18:45,349
I disagree strongly!
But we're not going into it right now.

312
00:18:46,433 --> 00:18:47,434
The point is...

313
00:18:47,601 --> 00:18:51,939
nobody expected us to be able to actually
run Dad's company.

314
00:18:52,106 --> 00:18:55,526
But with Evelyn as designer,
and myself as operator...

315
00:18:55,693 --> 00:18:59,697
we threw ourselves into
building DEVTECH into what it is today.

316
00:18:59,864 --> 00:19:02,324
A world-class telecommunications company.

317
00:19:02,491 --> 00:19:03,659
Bigger than ever.

318
00:19:03,826 --> 00:19:06,871
Perfectly positioned
to make some wrong things right.

319
00:19:07,037 --> 00:19:08,789
Hence, this meeting.

320
00:19:08,956 --> 00:19:10,374
Let me ask you something.

321
00:19:10,541 --> 00:19:13,961
What is the main reason
you were all forced underground?

322
00:19:14,128 --> 00:19:16,088
- Ignorance.
- Perception.

323
00:19:16,255 --> 00:19:18,340
Take today for example, with the Underminer.

324
00:19:18,507 --> 00:19:19,633
Difficult situation.

325
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:22,094
You were faced with a lot of hard decisions.

326
00:19:22,261 --> 00:19:23,345
Tell me about it.

327
00:19:23,512 --> 00:19:24,722
I can't.

328
00:19:24,889 --> 00:19:27,224
Because I didn't see it...

329
00:19:27,391 --> 00:19:29,143
neither did anyone else.

330
00:19:29,310 --> 00:19:31,478
So, when you fight bad guys like today...

331
00:19:31,645 --> 00:19:34,231
people don't see the fight
or what led up to it.

332
00:19:34,398 --> 00:19:36,567
They see what politicians tell them to see.

333
00:19:36,734 --> 00:19:39,320
They see destruction and they see you.

334
00:19:39,612 --> 00:19:43,490
So, if we wanna change
people's perceptions about superheroes...

335
00:19:43,657 --> 00:19:47,286
we need you to share your perceptions
with the world.

336
00:19:47,453 --> 00:19:49,330
- How do we do that?
- With cameras.

337
00:19:49,496 --> 00:19:53,417
We need you to share your
perceptions with the world.

338
00:19:53,584 --> 00:19:54,752
How do we do that?

339
00:19:54,919 --> 00:19:58,214
We embed tiny cameras, like those,
into your Supersuits.

340
00:19:58,380 --> 00:19:59,506
Wow, so small.

341
00:19:59,673 --> 00:20:01,050
And the picture is outstanding.

342
00:20:01,217 --> 00:20:02,635
Thanks! Designed 'em myself.

343
00:20:03,093 --> 00:20:05,804
We've got resources, lobbyists,
worldwide connections...

344
00:20:05,971 --> 00:20:08,140
and very important, insurance.

345
00:20:08,307 --> 00:20:09,517
Insurance is key.

346
00:20:09,683 --> 00:20:11,977
All we need now
are the super-est superheroes.

347
00:20:12,144 --> 00:20:14,396
It needs you three. Come on!

348
00:20:14,563 --> 00:20:17,608
Help me make all Supers legal again.

349
00:20:17,900 --> 00:20:19,235
This sounds great!

350
00:20:19,401 --> 00:20:21,320
Let's get this going.
What's my first assignment?

351
00:20:21,487 --> 00:20:23,405
That enthusiasm is golden.

352
00:20:23,572 --> 00:20:25,824
Now hold on to it. But for our first move...

353
00:20:25,991 --> 00:20:28,827
Elastigirl is our best play.

354
00:20:29,662 --> 00:20:31,372
Better than me?

355
00:20:32,998 --> 00:20:34,542
I mean, she's good.

356
00:20:34,708 --> 00:20:36,710
Really, a credit to her...

357
00:20:36,877 --> 00:20:39,505
You know. You know.

358
00:20:39,672 --> 00:20:40,714
With great respect...

359
00:20:40,881 --> 00:20:43,801
let's not test the whole
"insurance-will-pay-for-everything" idea...

360
00:20:43,968 --> 00:20:45,761
on the first go 'round, okay?

361
00:20:46,303 --> 00:20:49,682
Wait a minute. You're saying what? I'm messy?

362
00:20:49,848 --> 00:20:51,725
Well, Evelyn did a cost-benefit analysis...

363
00:20:51,892 --> 00:20:55,813
comparing all your last five years
of crime fighting before going underground.

364
00:20:55,980 --> 00:20:57,815
And Elastigirl's numbers
are self-explanatory.

365
00:20:57,982 --> 00:20:59,900
Well, it's not a fair comparison!

366
00:21:00,067 --> 00:21:02,611
Heavyweight problems
need heavyweight solutions.

367
00:21:02,778 --> 00:21:06,365
Of course! We're gonna solve
all kinds of problems together.

368
00:21:06,532 --> 00:21:10,911
After the perfect launch with Elastigirl!

369
00:21:11,745 --> 00:21:13,497
So, what do you say?

370
00:21:14,164 --> 00:21:15,666
What do I say?

371
00:21:17,459 --> 00:21:19,587
I don't know.

372
00:21:19,753 --> 00:21:21,463
What do you mean, you don't know?

373
00:21:21,630 --> 00:21:23,757
A few hours ago,
you were saying it was over...

374
00:21:23,924 --> 00:21:26,051
and being a superhero was a fantasy.

375
00:21:26,218 --> 00:21:29,430
Now, you get the offer of a lifetime
and you don't know?

376
00:21:29,597 --> 00:21:32,725
It's not that simple, Bob.
I wanna protect the kids!

377
00:21:32,892 --> 00:21:34,310
So do I.

378
00:21:34,476 --> 00:21:36,103
From jail, Bob!

379
00:21:36,270 --> 00:21:37,396
And how do you do that?

380
00:21:37,563 --> 00:21:41,233
By turning down a chance to change the law
that forces them to hide what they are?

381
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:43,777
They haven't decided what they are.
They're still kids.

382
00:21:43,944 --> 00:21:46,280
Kids with powers, which makes them Supers...

383
00:21:46,447 --> 00:21:48,741
whether they decide
to use those powers or not.

384
00:21:48,908 --> 00:21:50,034
This will benefit them.

385
00:21:50,201 --> 00:21:51,994
It's not a good time to be away.

386
00:21:52,161 --> 00:21:53,621
Dash is having trouble with homework...

387
00:21:53,787 --> 00:21:56,874
Vi is worried about her first date
with that boy she likes, Tony...

388
00:21:57,041 --> 00:21:58,042
and Jack-Jack...

389
00:21:58,209 --> 00:22:00,002
Jack-Jack? What's wrong with him?

390
00:22:00,961 --> 00:22:02,171
Okay, nothing's wrong with Jack-Jack.

391
00:22:02,338 --> 00:22:04,882
But even a normal baby
needs a lot of attention.

392
00:22:05,049 --> 00:22:06,634
I'm just not sure I can leave.

393
00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:08,052
Of course you can leave.

394
00:22:08,219 --> 00:22:10,221
You've got to. So that I...

395
00:22:10,387 --> 00:22:13,933
we can be Supers again,
so our kids can have that choice.

396
00:22:14,767 --> 00:22:15,893
So you can have that choice.

397
00:22:16,060 --> 00:22:17,228
All right, yes!

398
00:22:17,394 --> 00:22:19,563
So I can have that choice.

399
00:22:19,980 --> 00:22:22,316
And I would do a great job!

400
00:22:22,483 --> 00:22:26,695
Regardless of what
Deavor's pie charts say or whatever...

401
00:22:26,862 --> 00:22:28,906
But they want you.

402
00:22:29,073 --> 00:22:31,617
And you'll do a great...

403
00:22:32,535 --> 00:22:33,786
job...

404
00:22:34,370 --> 00:22:35,579
too.

405
00:22:37,873 --> 00:22:39,792
Well, that was excruciating to watch.

406
00:22:41,001 --> 00:22:42,253
I can't lie to you.

407
00:22:42,419 --> 00:22:45,422
It's nice to be wanted.
Flattering, you know, but...

408
00:22:45,589 --> 00:22:46,507
But what's the choice?

409
00:22:46,674 --> 00:22:49,176
One, do this right, get well paid,
we're out of the motel...

410
00:22:49,343 --> 00:22:52,388
and things get better for all Supers,
including our kids.

411
00:22:52,555 --> 00:22:54,098
Or two...

412
00:22:54,265 --> 00:22:56,684
I find a job in two weeks or we're homeless.

413
00:22:57,518 --> 00:22:59,103
You know it's crazy, right?

414
00:22:59,270 --> 00:23:01,355
To help my family, I gotta leave it.

415
00:23:01,522 --> 00:23:03,607
- To fix the law, I gotta break it.
- You'll be great.

416
00:23:03,774 --> 00:23:06,026
I know I will.
But what about you? We have kids.

417
00:23:06,193 --> 00:23:07,736
I'll watch the kids, no problem.

418
00:23:07,903 --> 00:23:09,405
- Easy.
- Easy, huh?

419
00:23:09,572 --> 00:23:11,115
You're adorable.

420
00:23:11,282 --> 00:23:13,617
Well, if there is a problem,
I'll drop this thing and come right back.

421
00:23:13,784 --> 00:23:14,952
You won't need to.

422
00:23:15,119 --> 00:23:17,121
I got it, you go do this thing.

423
00:23:17,830 --> 00:23:19,832
Do it so...

424
00:23:19,999 --> 00:23:21,542
I can do it better.

425
00:23:23,669 --> 00:23:24,587
Deavor here.

426
00:23:24,753 --> 00:23:26,046
This is Elastigirl.

427
00:23:26,213 --> 00:23:27,256
I'm in.

428
00:23:30,676 --> 00:23:33,262
Mr. Deavor, it's wonderful...

429
00:23:33,429 --> 00:23:34,889
but it's too generous.

430
00:23:35,055 --> 00:23:36,307
Nonsense! That's the least we can do.

431
00:23:36,473 --> 00:23:39,768
We're partners now!
Can't have my partners living in a motel.

432
00:23:39,935 --> 00:23:42,354
But whose house? Is it a house?

433
00:23:42,521 --> 00:23:44,648
It's my house. I have several.
I'm not using that one.

434
00:23:44,815 --> 00:23:46,525
Stay as long as you need.

435
00:23:46,692 --> 00:23:48,152
I don't know what to say.

436
00:23:48,319 --> 00:23:50,321
How about "thanks"?

437
00:23:51,363 --> 00:23:53,324
This is our new house?

438
00:23:53,490 --> 00:23:56,744
Okay, easy, tiger. It's being loaned to us.

439
00:23:56,911 --> 00:23:58,662
This is homey.

440
00:23:58,829 --> 00:24:02,708
Look at this place. Deavor bought it
from an eccentric billionaire...

441
00:24:02,875 --> 00:24:04,418
who liked to come and go
without being seen...

442
00:24:04,585 --> 00:24:06,962
so the house has multiple hidden exits.

443
00:24:07,129 --> 00:24:08,672
Good thing we won't stand out.

444
00:24:08,839 --> 00:24:11,634
Wouldn't want to attract
any unnecessary attention.

445
00:24:11,800 --> 00:24:13,719
It's got a big yard!

446
00:24:13,886 --> 00:24:15,804
Isn't this a bit much?

447
00:24:15,971 --> 00:24:17,765
Near a forest!

448
00:24:17,932 --> 00:24:19,558
Would you rather be at the motel?

449
00:24:19,725 --> 00:24:22,019
And a pool!

450
00:24:22,186 --> 00:24:24,313
What exactly is Mom's new job?

451
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:26,732
The important thing is
we're out of the motel.

452
00:24:26,899 --> 00:24:29,193
I like Mom's new job!

453
00:24:41,413 --> 00:24:44,083
Well, check out the water features.

454
00:24:46,210 --> 00:24:47,127
Wow.

455
00:24:49,213 --> 00:24:50,756
Wicked cool!

456
00:24:56,845 --> 00:24:58,264
Hey! Dash! Stop it!

457
00:24:58,430 --> 00:25:00,182
- Not the couch! Stop it!
- No! Dash!

458
00:25:01,350 --> 00:25:02,768
- Stop! Don't touch the buttons!
- The couch!

459
00:25:02,935 --> 00:25:03,853
- Dash!
- No!

460
00:25:04,019 --> 00:25:05,896
No, no!

461
00:25:06,063 --> 00:25:07,731
Oh, no. Oh, boy.

462
00:25:08,190 --> 00:25:09,984
This isn't me.

463
00:25:12,361 --> 00:25:15,489
I'm not all dark and angsty.

464
00:25:15,656 --> 00:25:16,740
I'm Elastigirl.

465
00:25:16,907 --> 00:25:18,701
I'm, you know, flexible.

466
00:25:18,868 --> 00:25:20,077
E designed this?

467
00:25:20,244 --> 00:25:23,122
No, some guy named Alexander Galbaki.

468
00:25:23,664 --> 00:25:27,835
Glad it's you and not me,
'cause you're gonna hear from her.

469
00:25:28,002 --> 00:25:29,211
This note came with it.

470
00:25:29,378 --> 00:25:30,379
What?

471
00:25:37,303 --> 00:25:39,346
A new Elasticycle.

472
00:25:39,513 --> 00:25:42,016
Elasticycle? I didn't know you had a bike.

473
00:25:42,182 --> 00:25:44,852
Hey, I had a mohawk.
There's a lot about me you don't know.

474
00:25:45,019 --> 00:25:46,896
Yeah, but... A mohawk?

475
00:25:47,062 --> 00:25:49,273
You didn't miss anything.

476
00:25:52,276 --> 00:25:54,111
Yeah! This one's electric.

477
00:25:54,278 --> 00:25:56,238
What's that mean?

478
00:26:00,242 --> 00:26:02,912
Means it's torque-y. I'll get the hang of it.

479
00:26:03,078 --> 00:26:03,954
You will be great.

480
00:26:04,121 --> 00:26:05,998
I will be great. And you will, too.

481
00:26:06,165 --> 00:26:07,666
We will both be great.

482
00:26:07,833 --> 00:26:08,959
Bye, sweetie.

483
00:26:31,899 --> 00:26:34,443
- Wait a minute! Is that Elastigirl?
- I think that's Elastigirl.

484
00:26:34,610 --> 00:26:36,779
Hey! Elastigirl!

485
00:26:43,035 --> 00:26:44,995
Marry me, Elastigirl!

486
00:26:47,831 --> 00:26:49,833
Here comes Elastigirl
Stretching her

487
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:53,337
No theme songs
or I'll turn this bus right around!

488
00:26:56,715 --> 00:26:58,175
Look at that.

489
00:26:58,342 --> 00:27:01,387
New Urbem. You wanna make
a big crime fighting statement...

490
00:27:01,554 --> 00:27:03,222
you go where the crime is big.

491
00:27:03,389 --> 00:27:05,599
Strange thing to be excited about, Winston.

492
00:27:05,766 --> 00:27:07,935
It's like a superhero's playground!

493
00:27:11,897 --> 00:27:13,607
No Sugar Bombs on my watch.

494
00:27:17,361 --> 00:27:18,362
Where's Mom?

495
00:27:18,529 --> 00:27:21,240
She's up and out.
She's at her new job doing hero work.

496
00:27:21,407 --> 00:27:23,951
But I thought superheroes were still illegal.

497
00:27:24,118 --> 00:27:25,619
They are, for now.

498
00:27:25,786 --> 00:27:28,622
So Mom is getting paid to break the law?

499
00:27:28,789 --> 00:27:29,999
She's not breaking...

500
00:27:30,165 --> 00:27:33,544
She's an advocate for superheroes.
It's a new job.

501
00:27:33,711 --> 00:27:36,463
So, Mom is going out illegally...

502
00:27:36,630 --> 00:27:39,633
to explain why she shouldn't be illegal.

503
00:27:39,800 --> 00:27:41,510
Hey...

504
00:27:41,677 --> 00:27:43,095
The bus is here!

505
00:27:43,846 --> 00:27:47,099
Grab your stuff quickly! Go on, get on the...

506
00:27:47,933 --> 00:27:50,060
Put your homework in your pack!

507
00:27:51,061 --> 00:27:52,229
Bye-bye!

508
00:27:58,235 --> 00:28:00,738
We're gonna get along just fine...

509
00:28:00,905 --> 00:28:03,908
'cause you don't ask any hard questions.

510
00:28:06,827 --> 00:28:09,413
All right. All locations, we need to know
where you want us.

511
00:28:09,580 --> 00:28:10,539
Stand by.

512
00:28:10,706 --> 00:28:13,792
Seems strange to wait for crime.

513
00:28:13,959 --> 00:28:15,544
Relax. You're smack in the middle...

514
00:28:15,711 --> 00:28:18,964
of the worst crime area in the city.
It's perfect.

515
00:28:19,131 --> 00:28:22,092
- It's a superhero's playground.
- "It's a superhero's playground." Right.

516
00:28:22,259 --> 00:28:23,886
You know, after we went underground...

517
00:28:24,053 --> 00:28:25,721
my husband used to listen
to a police scanner...

518
00:28:25,888 --> 00:28:27,389
waiting for something to happen.

519
00:28:27,556 --> 00:28:29,266
And I got mad at him for it.

520
00:28:31,227 --> 00:28:32,603
I'm such a hypocrite.

521
00:28:32,937 --> 00:28:34,188
- All units.
- Something's up.

522
00:28:34,355 --> 00:28:36,315
We've been picking up some chatter
about potential disruptions...

523
00:28:36,482 --> 00:28:38,484
to the hovertrain's opening ceremony.

524
00:28:39,235 --> 00:28:41,278
- Disruption or threat?
- Both.

525
00:28:41,445 --> 00:28:42,947
Station's at Fifty-Fourth and Nottingham.

526
00:28:43,113 --> 00:28:44,865
A potential threat! Perfect!

527
00:28:45,032 --> 00:28:47,326
Fifty-fourth and Nottingham. Go, go, go!

528
00:28:49,119 --> 00:28:52,414
Hey, Vi! I want you back here by 10:30.

529
00:28:52,581 --> 00:28:53,415
11-ish?

530
00:28:53,582 --> 00:28:55,751
10-ish, heading for 9:30-ish.

531
00:28:55,918 --> 00:28:57,836
10:30-ish it is.

532
00:28:58,003 --> 00:28:59,421
Enjoy the movie.

533
00:28:59,588 --> 00:29:01,590
"In the county of Noddoff...

534
00:29:01,757 --> 00:29:03,717
"the Frubbers of Freep...

535
00:29:03,884 --> 00:29:08,639
"are all giving in
to the sweet succor of sleep."

536
00:29:18,357 --> 00:29:20,776
We will control the horizontal...

537
00:29:20,943 --> 00:29:22,945
we will control the vertical.

538
00:29:29,118 --> 00:29:32,204
That's not the way
you're supposed to do it, Dad.

539
00:29:32,371 --> 00:29:33,998
They want us to do it this way.

540
00:29:34,164 --> 00:29:36,959
I don't know that way!
Why would they change math?

541
00:29:37,126 --> 00:29:39,336
- It's okay, Dad.
- Math is math!

542
00:29:39,503 --> 00:29:41,338
I'll just wait for Mom to get back.

543
00:29:41,505 --> 00:29:42,339
What?

544
00:29:42,506 --> 00:29:44,550
She won't understand it
any better than I do...

545
00:29:45,467 --> 00:29:46,677
The Outer Limits.

546
00:29:49,889 --> 00:29:53,809
"All over Doozle-Dorf,
the Fribbers of Frupp are going to sleep...

547
00:29:53,976 --> 00:29:56,061
"'cause they just can't keep up.

548
00:29:56,228 --> 00:29:59,815
"All over Doozle-Dorf, Doozles are dozing.

549
00:29:59,982 --> 00:30:04,278
"Eyelids so heavy, they're drooping.

550
00:30:05,613 --> 00:30:09,992
"Closing! The point is:
Everyone, everyone's hitting the sack!

551
00:30:10,159 --> 00:30:13,412
"Everyone's getting the sleep
that they lack."

552
00:30:13,537 --> 00:30:16,707
Mayors often brag about their cities...

553
00:30:16,874 --> 00:30:18,375
and I'm no exception.

554
00:30:18,542 --> 00:30:21,921
And I'm willing to admit
that New Urbem is not the only city...

555
00:30:22,213 --> 00:30:24,298
Are you sure the police are gonna be
okay with this?

556
00:30:24,423 --> 00:30:26,258
Sure. You're making life easy for them.

557
00:30:26,425 --> 00:30:29,220
They still haven't forgiven us for
the last time we made life easy for them.

558
00:30:29,386 --> 00:30:31,388
I know the Chief of Police.
There won't be a problem.

559
00:30:31,555 --> 00:30:32,681
With all due respect...

560
00:30:32,848 --> 00:30:34,934
if you alone had handled the Underminer...

561
00:30:35,100 --> 00:30:36,769
things would have been different.

562
00:30:37,102 --> 00:30:38,270
I'm just saying.

563
00:30:38,437 --> 00:30:40,648
...on budget and ahead of schedule...

564
00:30:40,814 --> 00:30:44,109
to launch our magnificent new hovertrain.

565
00:30:44,276 --> 00:30:48,822
It can get you where you need to go
at ridiculous speeds.

566
00:30:48,989 --> 00:30:52,117
The future is open for business!

567
00:31:12,346 --> 00:31:13,639
Wait. The train has stopped.

568
00:31:17,351 --> 00:31:18,477
It's going the wrong direction.

569
00:31:20,062 --> 00:31:21,438
It's going the wrong way.

570
00:31:21,605 --> 00:31:22,606
I'm going after it.

571
00:31:28,696 --> 00:31:29,947
This thing's really moving.

572
00:31:30,114 --> 00:31:32,366
100 and climbing. How much track is built?

573
00:31:33,784 --> 00:31:35,035
About 25 miles.

574
00:31:43,168 --> 00:31:44,712
No one can shut this thing down?

575
00:31:44,879 --> 00:31:45,880
They've tried. No-go.

576
00:31:48,132 --> 00:31:49,425
Is that Elastigirl?

577
00:31:57,141 --> 00:31:58,058
Overrides?

578
00:31:58,225 --> 00:31:59,351
They're locked out of the system.

579
00:32:06,567 --> 00:32:07,610
What about a fail-safe?

580
00:32:07,776 --> 00:32:08,694
Not enough time.

581
00:32:11,989 --> 00:32:13,741
Someone's calling! Switching over.

582
00:32:13,908 --> 00:32:16,827
Hey, Mom. I can't find my high-tops
and Dad can't find them either.

583
00:32:16,994 --> 00:32:19,413
But he won't call you and ask, so I am.

584
00:32:19,580 --> 00:32:20,873
Do not call your mother!

585
00:32:21,040 --> 00:32:22,499
Dash, honey. Can't talk right now.

586
00:32:22,666 --> 00:32:23,667
Look under your bed, okay.

587
00:32:23,834 --> 00:32:25,544
- How much time?
- Less than two minutes!

588
00:32:26,503 --> 00:32:28,297
There's a shortcut.
Cut through the culvert up ahead.

589
00:32:36,680 --> 00:32:38,807
I don't know if I can stay with it.

590
00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:49,146
What the heck was that?

591
00:34:49,313 --> 00:34:51,023
Is everybody all right? Is anybody injured?

592
00:34:51,190 --> 00:34:52,358
Are you all right?

593
00:34:55,778 --> 00:34:57,404
Your story better be good.

594
00:34:59,240 --> 00:35:01,242
Hey. Hey!

595
00:35:01,408 --> 00:35:02,868
What happened?

596
00:35:36,360 --> 00:35:37,528
Honey, why are you...

597
00:35:37,695 --> 00:35:40,197
Don't say anything.

598
00:35:44,577 --> 00:35:46,996
It's Dad. Are you okay?

599
00:35:47,162 --> 00:35:50,040
I'm fine. I don't wanna talk about it.

600
00:35:50,207 --> 00:35:51,792
Tony didn't even call?

601
00:35:51,959 --> 00:35:53,836
I don't wanna talk about it.

602
00:35:54,003 --> 00:35:55,296
- Honey...
- Dad!

603
00:35:55,462 --> 00:35:59,216
If you want me to feel better,
then leave me alone.

604
00:35:59,383 --> 00:36:00,384
Please?

605
00:36:00,551 --> 00:36:02,428
See, there's nothing a cop hates worse
than a missing child.

606
00:36:02,595 --> 00:36:05,681
My kid brother's son.
Today is his first birthday.

607
00:36:06,390 --> 00:36:09,101
But if anybody can find that child,
it's you, Roman.

608
00:36:09,268 --> 00:36:10,936
Because you're a wonderful policeman.

609
00:36:12,104 --> 00:36:13,647
This is a holdup.

610
00:36:14,815 --> 00:36:16,775
All right, get your hands up, turn your back.

611
00:36:16,942 --> 00:36:19,486
Put your hands behind your heads
and keep them there!

612
00:36:19,653 --> 00:36:20,613
Don't move!

613
00:36:21,238 --> 00:36:24,241
Drop that. All right, now get over there.

614
00:36:24,408 --> 00:36:26,368
Watch the door.

615
00:36:26,535 --> 00:36:27,745
You think I'm kiddin'?

616
00:36:31,415 --> 00:36:32,416
Now.

617
00:36:35,961 --> 00:36:37,338
I said now!

618
00:36:37,504 --> 00:36:40,049
I got it! Come on, I tell you, come on!

619
00:36:42,176 --> 00:36:43,510
You wanna get killed?

620
00:38:17,897 --> 00:38:20,733
No, no, no!

621
00:38:23,861 --> 00:38:24,987
No!

622
00:38:27,364 --> 00:38:29,575
No, no, no.

623
00:38:29,742 --> 00:38:31,577
No, no, no.

624
00:38:31,744 --> 00:38:33,787
No, no, no!

625
00:38:41,754 --> 00:38:45,007
You have powers!

626
00:38:45,174 --> 00:38:48,761
Yeah, baby, and there's not a scratch on you!

627
00:38:48,928 --> 00:38:51,639
Did you go through the locked door?
Are those your powers?

628
00:38:52,890 --> 00:38:57,144
Who can multiply like rabbits
and go right through any solid...

629
00:39:01,982 --> 00:39:03,692
Oh, my God!

630
00:39:09,657 --> 00:39:11,033
- Hello?
- Hey, honey.

631
00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:12,952
- You weren't gonna call me?
- Oh, hey!

632
00:39:13,118 --> 00:39:15,162
No. I mean, yes, yeah...

633
00:39:15,329 --> 00:39:17,540
I just didn't wanna wake you.

634
00:39:17,706 --> 00:39:20,417
The strangest thing just happened
out in the yard.

635
00:39:20,584 --> 00:39:22,711
- Sounds like I just woke you up.
- No, no.

636
00:39:22,878 --> 00:39:24,672
- It's just, Jack-Jack...
- He had an accident!

637
00:39:24,838 --> 00:39:27,633
I knew it! I'm coming home right now!
I never should have...

638
00:39:27,800 --> 00:39:30,219
No accident.
Stay there and finish your mission.

639
00:39:30,386 --> 00:39:31,720
You never should...

640
00:39:31,887 --> 00:39:33,847
What? You don't think I can do this?

641
00:39:34,014 --> 00:39:36,392
No, no. Sorry. I misspoke.

642
00:39:36,559 --> 00:39:37,810
Do you need me to come back?

643
00:39:37,977 --> 00:39:40,771
No, no. No, I've got this.
Everything's great.

644
00:39:40,938 --> 00:39:42,314
What happened with Jack-Jack?

645
00:39:43,816 --> 00:39:46,026
Nothing. He's in excellent health.

646
00:39:46,193 --> 00:39:47,361
Well, that's good.

647
00:39:48,320 --> 00:39:49,905
How was Violet's date?

648
00:39:50,823 --> 00:39:52,324
That was tonight, right?

649
00:39:53,117 --> 00:39:54,994
Yes. Good.

650
00:39:55,160 --> 00:39:57,246
All fine and good.

651
00:39:57,413 --> 00:39:59,164
And Jack-Jack went down with no trouble?

652
00:39:59,331 --> 00:40:00,833
Fine, yes, no trouble.

653
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:02,585
And Dash got his homework done?

654
00:40:02,751 --> 00:40:04,003
All done.

655
00:40:04,169 --> 00:40:06,213
So, things haven't spiraled out
of control the moment I left?

656
00:40:06,380 --> 00:40:10,718
Amazing as it may seem,
it has been quite uneventful in fact.

657
00:40:10,885 --> 00:40:12,386
How about you?

658
00:40:12,553 --> 00:40:14,680
I saved a runaway train!

659
00:40:16,724 --> 00:40:18,392
It was so great!

660
00:40:18,559 --> 00:40:20,352
The mayor was there to cut the ribbon
on this new train.

661
00:40:21,228 --> 00:40:24,982
Elastigirl pursued the train
and was able to successfully activate...

662
00:40:25,149 --> 00:40:27,193
Blah, blah, blah.
He says a few words, cuts the ribbon...

663
00:40:27,359 --> 00:40:29,987
and the train starts
pulling out of the station backwards...

664
00:40:30,154 --> 00:40:33,407
- track of its brand new hovertrain...
- ...malfunctioned...

665
00:40:33,574 --> 00:40:34,658
...thanking Elastigirl...

666
00:40:36,619 --> 00:40:38,412
- Superhero Elastigirl...
- Elastigirl...

667
00:40:38,579 --> 00:40:41,498
Boom! No casualties!

668
00:40:41,999 --> 00:40:44,627
...specialized motorbike,
saving all of the passengers...

669
00:40:44,793 --> 00:40:46,962
One thing leads to another
and suddenly, I go after it!

670
00:40:47,129 --> 00:40:49,298
I'm telling you, honey, it was a saga!

671
00:40:49,465 --> 00:40:51,258
That's fantastic, honey!

672
00:40:51,425 --> 00:40:53,552
And on your first night!

673
00:40:53,719 --> 00:40:56,597
I am so proud of you, really.

674
00:40:56,764 --> 00:40:58,265
I'm proud of you, honey.

675
00:40:58,432 --> 00:41:00,935
I know you want to get out there
and you will soon.

676
00:41:01,101 --> 00:41:02,895
And you'll be amazing.

677
00:41:03,062 --> 00:41:05,606
I couldn't have done this
if you hadn't taken over so well.

678
00:41:05,773 --> 00:41:07,399
Thanks for handling everything.

679
00:41:07,566 --> 00:41:09,026
It's nothing.

680
00:41:09,193 --> 00:41:12,196
I love you, honey. I'll be back soon.

681
00:41:12,363 --> 00:41:13,280
Sweet dreams.

682
00:41:13,447 --> 00:41:15,074
Sweet dreams, honey.

683
00:41:31,549 --> 00:41:36,178
"Hey, Dad, it's okay.
I'll just wait for Mom to get home."

684
00:41:37,054 --> 00:41:39,765
As if she could... I know how to...

685
00:41:40,683 --> 00:41:42,059
I can do math.

686
00:41:52,027 --> 00:41:53,362
Oh, brother...

687
00:41:57,032 --> 00:41:58,659
Wait for Mom!

688
00:42:00,202 --> 00:42:02,371
What am I, a substitute parent?

689
00:42:05,165 --> 00:42:07,042
It's not my fault they changed math.

690
00:42:15,759 --> 00:42:18,095
Come on, buddy. Come on.

691
00:42:18,262 --> 00:42:20,806
I think I understand your math assignment.

692
00:42:20,973 --> 00:42:24,518
We still have some time to finish it
before your test.

693
00:42:24,685 --> 00:42:28,397
So first, you wanna put all the numbers
by themselves on one side.

694
00:42:28,606 --> 00:42:30,441
...you change the sign.

695
00:42:30,608 --> 00:42:33,235
That means a plus becomes a minus
and a minus...

696
00:42:33,402 --> 00:42:34,695
You got it?

697
00:42:34,862 --> 00:42:36,238
Yeah, baby!

698
00:42:51,128 --> 00:42:52,046
Hello.

699
00:42:52,838 --> 00:42:54,215
We're in a new house.

700
00:42:54,381 --> 00:42:57,384
I did write my address on your locker...

701
00:42:57,551 --> 00:42:59,428
in permanent ink.

702
00:42:59,595 --> 00:43:01,597
Is that what that is?

703
00:43:01,764 --> 00:43:03,098
Did you forget?

704
00:43:03,265 --> 00:43:05,309
Forget what?

705
00:43:07,311 --> 00:43:08,270
That's funny.

706
00:43:11,398 --> 00:43:12,733
Points for funny.

707
00:43:14,735 --> 00:43:16,237
Was it the weird outfit?

708
00:43:17,196 --> 00:43:18,572
Because there's a reason.

709
00:43:18,739 --> 00:43:20,824
I'm in a drama class...

710
00:43:20,991 --> 00:43:23,118
and they just wanna do Shakespeare...

711
00:43:23,285 --> 00:43:25,079
but they're like,
"Try to make it relevant for the kids."

712
00:43:25,246 --> 00:43:27,331
So, like, "Oh, superheroes!
Kids love superheroes."

713
00:43:27,498 --> 00:43:29,416
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- You wanna wear one kind of tights...

714
00:43:29,583 --> 00:43:31,794
and then they're like,
"No, wear these other kind of tights."

715
00:43:32,336 --> 00:43:33,420
Do I know you?

716
00:43:42,429 --> 00:43:44,515
Many say your speech today is critical.

717
00:43:44,682 --> 00:43:47,142
Both sides just want the best
for their people.

718
00:43:47,309 --> 00:43:50,896
We are so close to finally getting peace
in the region.

719
00:43:51,105 --> 00:43:52,773
I haven't done this in a while.

720
00:43:52,940 --> 00:43:55,276
This is good. The train gives us momentum.

721
00:43:55,442 --> 00:43:57,361
Just go out there
and be your charming self...

722
00:43:57,528 --> 00:43:58,779
and capitalize on it.

723
00:43:58,946 --> 00:44:01,282
Ms. Elastigirl, they're ready for you.

724
00:44:01,448 --> 00:44:03,075
Hey, stretch a leg.

725
00:44:05,119 --> 00:44:06,412
Thank you, Chad. It was fun.

726
00:44:07,079 --> 00:44:08,956
- Ambassador, your documents.
- We're moving to the rooftop.

727
00:44:10,249 --> 00:44:12,084
Madame Ambassador, hello!

728
00:44:12,251 --> 00:44:13,627
You are Elastigirl!

729
00:44:13,794 --> 00:44:15,880
This is why now I'm shaking your hand.

730
00:44:16,046 --> 00:44:18,090
It was so sad when you went underground.

731
00:44:18,257 --> 00:44:22,052
I am glad to see
you back in your shiny outfit.

732
00:44:22,219 --> 00:44:24,638
That means so much coming from you.
Good luck with your speech.

733
00:44:24,805 --> 00:44:26,223
This way, Ambassador.

734
00:44:26,390 --> 00:44:27,516
Bring lasting peace!

735
00:44:27,683 --> 00:44:29,435
I will, when you defeat evil.

736
00:44:30,227 --> 00:44:31,520
Okay.

737
00:44:31,687 --> 00:44:33,314
Three, two...

738
00:44:34,190 --> 00:44:36,901
For over 15 years,
superheroes have been in hiding.

739
00:44:37,067 --> 00:44:40,446
Forced into it by a society
no longer willing to support them.

740
00:44:40,613 --> 00:44:41,947
That may soon be changing...

741
00:44:42,114 --> 00:44:44,575
due to a growing movement
to bring the Supers back.

742
00:44:44,742 --> 00:44:48,454
Here, fresh on the heels of her own
heroic save of a runaway train...

743
00:44:48,621 --> 00:44:51,749
and sporting a new look,
is the superhero, Elastigirl.

744
00:44:51,916 --> 00:44:53,250
- Welcome!
- Hello, Chad.

745
00:44:53,417 --> 00:44:55,502
All the polls are going in your direction.

746
00:44:55,669 --> 00:44:56,837
That's true. Things are good...

747
00:44:57,004 --> 00:44:58,130
Hello.

748
00:44:59,215 --> 00:45:00,257
Hello?

749
00:45:00,424 --> 00:45:02,134
Do I have your attention?

750
00:45:02,509 --> 00:45:03,719
Yes, Chad.

751
00:45:03,886 --> 00:45:05,012
Of course I do.

752
00:45:05,179 --> 00:45:06,931
I'm appearing on your screen.

753
00:45:07,097 --> 00:45:10,017
Reading the words I'm saying
off of another screen.

754
00:45:10,184 --> 00:45:11,852
Screens are everywhere.

755
00:45:12,019 --> 00:45:14,355
We are controlled by screens.

756
00:45:14,939 --> 00:45:19,443
And screens are controlled by me...

757
00:45:19,902 --> 00:45:21,403
Screenslaver.

758
00:45:21,570 --> 00:45:22,446
Hey!

759
00:45:22,613 --> 00:45:24,907
I control this broadcast...

760
00:45:25,074 --> 00:45:27,535
and this idiotic anchorman
you see before you.

761
00:45:27,701 --> 00:45:28,619
What's wrong with him?

762
00:45:28,786 --> 00:45:30,120
The signal's been hijacked.
I'll check it out.

763
00:45:30,287 --> 00:45:31,789
Don't look at any monitors.

764
00:45:31,956 --> 00:45:34,208
I could hijack the ambassador's aerocade...

765
00:45:34,375 --> 00:45:36,418
while it's still airborne.

766
00:45:36,585 --> 00:45:38,295
Right, Elastigirl?

767
00:45:40,673 --> 00:45:42,800
Nearest window! Where's the nearest window?

768
00:45:55,521 --> 00:45:57,147
- What's going on?
- Where's Elastigirl?

769
00:45:57,314 --> 00:45:58,691
Which one?

770
00:46:07,700 --> 00:46:09,410
Elastigirl! What are you doing here?

771
00:46:09,577 --> 00:46:11,662
The ambassador is in danger.
Which chopper is she...

772
00:46:11,829 --> 00:46:13,122
Look out!

773
00:46:14,832 --> 00:46:16,834
Follow them and get me close!

774
00:46:19,879 --> 00:46:22,298
Get out of the sky, and touch down safely!

775
00:46:32,099 --> 00:46:34,059
Stand down! It's Elastigirl.

776
00:46:34,894 --> 00:46:36,604
Stay in your seat, ma'am!

777
00:46:44,153 --> 00:46:45,362
We're under attack!

778
00:46:45,529 --> 00:46:48,240
Quick, go! Protect the ambassador!

779
00:46:51,827 --> 00:46:52,828
Open the door!

780
00:46:52,995 --> 00:46:54,038
Do as she says!

781
00:46:56,332 --> 00:46:57,333
Can you all swim?

782
00:46:57,499 --> 00:46:58,709
- Yeah.
- No!

783
00:47:20,481 --> 00:47:22,733
We're gonna have to slingshot! Hang on!

784
00:47:31,367 --> 00:47:32,535
Are you all right, ma'am?

785
00:47:32,701 --> 00:47:34,370
I'm perfectly fine...

786
00:47:44,338 --> 00:47:46,840
Boys are jerks and superheroes suck.

787
00:47:47,049 --> 00:47:48,050
Good morning!

788
00:47:48,217 --> 00:47:50,177
He takes one look at me in that suit...

789
00:47:50,344 --> 00:47:54,014
and decides to pretend
he doesn't even know me.

790
00:47:54,181 --> 00:47:56,183
He's protecting himself.

791
00:47:56,350 --> 00:47:58,978
If he really did see you,
it's best that he forget.

792
00:47:59,144 --> 00:48:00,896
It's better for you, too.

793
00:48:01,063 --> 00:48:05,442
I can't tell you how many memories
Dicker's had to erase over the years...

794
00:48:05,609 --> 00:48:09,029
when someone figured out
your mother's or my identity.

795
00:48:09,905 --> 00:48:13,325
It was Dicker! You told him about Tony!

796
00:48:13,492 --> 00:48:16,579
- Honey...
- You had me erased from Tony's mind!

797
00:48:30,092 --> 00:48:31,760
I hate superheroes!

798
00:48:31,927 --> 00:48:33,804
And I renounce them!

799
00:48:40,144 --> 00:48:41,937
I renounce them!

800
00:48:50,779 --> 00:48:53,115
Is she having adolescence?

801
00:48:53,908 --> 00:48:57,286
A new report out today shows that,
when it comes to decision-making...

802
00:48:57,369 --> 00:49:00,497
people have more trust in
a monkey throwing darts than Congress.

803
00:49:00,664 --> 00:49:02,791
What's going on, Tommy? A protest?

804
00:49:02,958 --> 00:49:04,668
They're here in support.

805
00:49:04,835 --> 00:49:06,879
Support? Support of what?

806
00:49:07,046 --> 00:49:09,215
Well, in support of you.

807
00:49:12,301 --> 00:49:13,594
Wow.

808
00:49:13,761 --> 00:49:14,678
Oh, hey...

809
00:49:14,845 --> 00:49:16,931
Thanks for coming out. Hi.

810
00:49:17,556 --> 00:49:19,767
Oh, my goodness. Thanks so much.

811
00:49:20,184 --> 00:49:21,227
Hello.

812
00:49:21,393 --> 00:49:22,728
What does your sign say?

813
00:49:27,149 --> 00:49:30,569
Ka-boom! Ka-pow! Supers should be legal now!

814
00:49:31,403 --> 00:49:32,238
Talk to ya.

815
00:49:32,404 --> 00:49:33,447
Oh, what do ya know!

816
00:49:33,614 --> 00:49:34,865
Ellenwood.

817
00:49:35,032 --> 00:49:37,826
Now you wanna return my calls
about superheroes, huh?

818
00:49:37,993 --> 00:49:39,787
I'll have to call you back.

819
00:49:39,954 --> 00:49:40,955
That felt good.

820
00:49:41,121 --> 00:49:42,414
Felicia, hold my calls, please.

821
00:49:42,581 --> 00:49:44,083
Hey! It's working!

822
00:49:44,250 --> 00:49:47,586
The ambassador made a big speech
about superheroes today.

823
00:49:47,753 --> 00:49:50,839
Turns out saving someone's life makes
a good impression on them. Who knew?

824
00:49:51,006 --> 00:49:53,050
I'm getting calls from all over the world.

825
00:49:53,217 --> 00:49:55,678
Media awareness is up 72%.

826
00:49:55,844 --> 00:49:59,807
The push for superhero legalization
is becoming a worldwide movement!

827
00:49:59,974 --> 00:50:01,684
I have big plans for our next move.

828
00:50:01,851 --> 00:50:04,562
We're gonna have a summit at sea.
We'll use our ship...

829
00:50:04,728 --> 00:50:06,939
we'll gather leaders and Supers...

830
00:50:07,106 --> 00:50:09,275
- from all over the world.
- That's great.

831
00:50:09,441 --> 00:50:10,734
I'm happy.

832
00:50:10,901 --> 00:50:12,236
I'm happy the numbers are up.

833
00:50:12,403 --> 00:50:15,364
I'm happy the ambassador is pro-superhero...

834
00:50:15,531 --> 00:50:17,241
and I'm happy you're happy.

835
00:50:17,408 --> 00:50:20,411
I'm hearing that you're happy,
but why am I not feeling it?

836
00:50:20,578 --> 00:50:23,247
Because I didn't get him!
Screenslaver is still out there.

837
00:50:23,414 --> 00:50:26,375
All I did was play his game
and win this round.

838
00:50:26,542 --> 00:50:29,879
He's gonna want more
and as long as he gets to play, he wins.

839
00:50:30,045 --> 00:50:31,714
One thing I've learned in business?

840
00:50:31,881 --> 00:50:33,591
Smell the flowers.

841
00:50:33,757 --> 00:50:35,134
They don't bloom that often.

842
00:50:35,301 --> 00:50:37,803
What do you want on your tombstone?
"She worried a lot"?

843
00:50:37,970 --> 00:50:39,471
All right, stop talking.

844
00:50:40,014 --> 00:50:41,056
Show her.

845
00:50:46,437 --> 00:50:48,981
This is just so exciting, isn't it?

846
00:50:51,442 --> 00:50:52,443
Wow.

847
00:50:53,319 --> 00:50:56,447
Wow! Elastigirl, there you are.

848
00:50:56,614 --> 00:50:57,907
- Hello.
- I didn't...

849
00:50:58,073 --> 00:50:58,991
Wow!

850
00:50:59,158 --> 00:51:01,285
Come on, get yourself together, Karen.

851
00:51:01,994 --> 00:51:04,997
Hi, my superhero name is Voyd.

852
00:51:05,164 --> 00:51:08,834
I just wanna thank you, for being you!

853
00:51:11,086 --> 00:51:14,173
Okay, what I can do is this.

854
00:51:20,721 --> 00:51:21,555
Yeah.

855
00:51:21,722 --> 00:51:25,184
That is impressive. Very interdimensional.

856
00:51:25,351 --> 00:51:27,478
I felt like an outcast before.

857
00:51:27,645 --> 00:51:31,690
But now, with you being you, I feel like...

858
00:51:33,609 --> 00:51:34,652
Yay, me.

859
00:51:35,986 --> 00:51:37,780
I flew them in from all over.

860
00:51:37,947 --> 00:51:39,573
They've all been in hiding.

861
00:51:39,740 --> 00:51:41,867
They have powers, secret identities...

862
00:51:42,034 --> 00:51:43,994
and names they've given themselves.

863
00:51:44,828 --> 00:51:46,872
I'm Screech. It's a pleasure.

864
00:51:47,039 --> 00:51:50,334
I've always considered you
the gold standard for superheroes.

865
00:51:50,501 --> 00:51:52,503
Thanks. You're too nice.

866
00:51:52,670 --> 00:51:54,380
I am called Brick.

867
00:51:54,547 --> 00:51:57,716
Nice to meet you, Brick. Where are you from?

868
00:51:57,883 --> 00:51:59,218
Wisconsin.

869
00:51:59,385 --> 00:52:02,471
Elastigirl. I assume your powers are...

870
00:52:02,638 --> 00:52:04,890
You know, zapping things electrically...

871
00:52:05,057 --> 00:52:07,184
charging things,
bolts of lightning, that kind of stuff.

872
00:52:07,351 --> 00:52:08,561
Name's Reflux.

873
00:52:08,727 --> 00:52:11,939
Medical condition or superpower, you decide.

874
00:52:12,523 --> 00:52:14,692
That's a little line I say just to
put people at ease.

875
00:52:14,859 --> 00:52:15,901
Hope I don't offend.

876
00:52:16,068 --> 00:52:17,945
No, no, no. Reflux. Love it.

877
00:52:18,988 --> 00:52:21,949
I do look forward to working with you.

878
00:52:22,366 --> 00:52:25,369
Yes, that is impressive. Keep practicing.

879
00:52:31,250 --> 00:52:34,753
Well, I'm beat. Congratulations. Big day.

880
00:52:34,920 --> 00:52:37,089
Good night, ladies. I will see you tomorrow.

881
00:52:37,256 --> 00:52:38,257
Good night.

882
00:52:38,716 --> 00:52:41,760
Must be nice for you,
being out front after all this time.

883
00:52:41,927 --> 00:52:42,970
Out front?

884
00:52:43,137 --> 00:52:45,973
Well, it's been a while
since your superhero days...

885
00:52:46,140 --> 00:52:49,310
and even then, you were kind of in
Mr. Incredible's shadow.

886
00:52:49,476 --> 00:52:50,978
Nah, I beg to differ.

887
00:52:51,145 --> 00:52:52,980
I'm not saying you weren't big.

888
00:52:53,147 --> 00:52:55,024
No, you were, and are, a superstar...

889
00:52:55,191 --> 00:52:57,902
but you have the stage to yourself now.

890
00:52:58,068 --> 00:52:59,945
And people have to pay attention.

891
00:53:00,112 --> 00:53:01,655
Oh, you mean, "It's a man's world"
and all that?

892
00:53:01,822 --> 00:53:04,950
What world do you live in?
Your brother runs DEVTECH.

893
00:53:05,117 --> 00:53:09,163
I don't want his job. I invent, he sells.

894
00:53:09,330 --> 00:53:12,499
I ask you,
which of us has the greater influence?

895
00:53:12,666 --> 00:53:15,419
Which side of me are you asking?
The believer or the cynic?

896
00:53:15,586 --> 00:53:16,545
The cynic...

897
00:53:16,712 --> 00:53:20,466
Would say selling is more important because
the best sellers have the most buyers.

898
00:53:20,633 --> 00:53:24,053
Doesn't matter what you're selling.
It only matters what people buy.

899
00:53:24,220 --> 00:53:25,262
This is true.

900
00:53:25,429 --> 00:53:27,765
If I discovered the origin of the universe...

901
00:53:27,932 --> 00:53:32,228
my brother would find a way
to market it as a foot massager.

902
00:53:34,855 --> 00:53:36,524
So, what would the believer say?

903
00:53:36,690 --> 00:53:39,068
The believer would tell you
to make your mark.

904
00:53:39,235 --> 00:53:42,988
Don't wait for permission, assert yourself
and impose your will on the status quo.

905
00:53:43,155 --> 00:53:44,782
- Sounds like my brother.
- What?

906
00:53:44,949 --> 00:53:46,033
You sound like my brother.

907
00:53:46,200 --> 00:53:49,245
Well, he's not wrong.
There is an art to getting a reaction...

908
00:53:49,411 --> 00:53:50,412
I know how to get him.

909
00:53:50,579 --> 00:53:53,499
- My brother?
- No. Screenslaver!

910
00:53:53,666 --> 00:53:56,168
You're tech-savvy.
I need to lock onto a signal...

911
00:53:56,335 --> 00:53:57,419
and trace its origin.

912
00:53:57,586 --> 00:53:59,755
How fast can you slap something together
and meet me at the airport?

913
00:53:59,922 --> 00:54:01,757
- Airport?
- Need to go out of town, pronto.

914
00:54:02,007 --> 00:54:03,884
I can get your contraption together
by 5:00 a.m.

915
00:54:04,051 --> 00:54:05,928
I need to get on TV. Chad!

916
00:54:06,095 --> 00:54:08,847
I'll get my brother to set up an exclusive
with him tonight on the newscast.

917
00:54:09,014 --> 00:54:11,016
- Finish our interview by phone!
- Promote the hell out of it.

918
00:54:11,183 --> 00:54:12,852
Independence from Screenslavery!

919
00:54:13,018 --> 00:54:13,811
Chad tonight.

920
00:54:13,978 --> 00:54:15,229
Boom!

921
00:54:19,024 --> 00:54:20,359
- Dicker.
- Yeah, hey, Rick.

922
00:54:20,526 --> 00:54:23,195
You remember that kid I mentioned
to you? Tony Rydinger.

923
00:54:23,362 --> 00:54:25,072
Mind wipe? Yeah, nice kid.

924
00:54:25,239 --> 00:54:28,826
You also wiped out the Friday night date
my daughter had with him.

925
00:54:28,993 --> 00:54:31,245
In fact, you wiped out my daughter.

926
00:54:31,412 --> 00:54:33,664
Oops. Not an exact science, Bob.

927
00:54:33,831 --> 00:54:35,457
Rick, you gotta help me here.

928
00:54:35,624 --> 00:54:38,544
Violet hates me, and you, and superheroes.

929
00:54:38,711 --> 00:54:41,130
I gotta fix this.
What do you know about Tony?

930
00:54:42,548 --> 00:54:43,841
Not much.

931
00:54:44,008 --> 00:54:45,509
Seems like a good kid.

932
00:54:45,676 --> 00:54:47,761
Popular, plays sports, music.

933
00:54:47,928 --> 00:54:51,348
Parents own The Happy Platter,
kid works there part time.

934
00:54:51,682 --> 00:54:53,684
Happy Platter?

935
00:54:56,437 --> 00:55:00,816
Why did we drive all the way
across town for The Happy Platter?

936
00:55:00,983 --> 00:55:04,236
We'd like a booth over there,
near the philodendron.

937
00:55:04,403 --> 00:55:06,530
Good, right? Near the philodendron.

938
00:55:09,033 --> 00:55:11,869
This platter doesn't look all that happy
to me.

939
00:55:12,036 --> 00:55:14,163
It looks bored.

940
00:55:14,330 --> 00:55:15,956
The Bored Platter!

941
00:55:16,123 --> 00:55:19,501
I thought Vi would want a change of pace
from drive-in food.

942
00:55:19,668 --> 00:55:21,378
I like drive-in food.

943
00:55:21,545 --> 00:55:23,297
Does this mean vegetables?

944
00:55:23,464 --> 00:55:25,299
A balanced diet means vegetables, kiddo.

945
00:55:25,466 --> 00:55:26,842
Get used to it.

946
00:55:27,635 --> 00:55:28,928
Good evening, everyone.

947
00:55:29,678 --> 00:55:31,472
Oh, no!

948
00:55:31,639 --> 00:55:32,848
- Is she all right?
- Violet, are you okay?

949
00:55:33,015 --> 00:55:34,725
- Nothing to see here.
- Yeah, more napkins would be good.

950
00:55:34,892 --> 00:55:36,769
- I'm fine, I'm fine.
- It happens all the time here.

951
00:55:36,936 --> 00:55:38,020
Mops it right up.

952
00:55:38,187 --> 00:55:40,689
Normally, she doesn't ever drip like this.

953
00:55:40,856 --> 00:55:42,983
- Would you like water, sir?
- Yes.

954
00:55:43,150 --> 00:55:45,903
Yes, I would. This is my daughter...

955
00:55:46,070 --> 00:55:47,446
- who you must know, right?
- God. Stop.

956
00:55:47,613 --> 00:55:48,739
- Hello.
- Violet.

957
00:55:48,906 --> 00:55:50,074
Hello, Violet.

958
00:55:51,367 --> 00:55:52,618
Hey, Vi, say hi to...

959
00:55:52,785 --> 00:55:54,161
Don't push it, Dad.

960
00:55:54,328 --> 00:55:55,955
I'm Dash, her little brother.

961
00:55:56,121 --> 00:55:57,081
Hello.

962
00:55:57,915 --> 00:56:00,834
This is really good water.
It's very refreshing.

963
00:56:01,001 --> 00:56:02,127
Spring water, is it?

964
00:56:02,294 --> 00:56:04,713
I don't know, sir. I think it's tap.

965
00:56:04,880 --> 00:56:06,340
Well, it is very good.

966
00:56:06,507 --> 00:56:07,716
Excellent tap.

967
00:56:07,883 --> 00:56:09,301
Excuse me.

968
00:56:10,553 --> 00:56:11,929
Nice to meet you.

969
00:56:12,096 --> 00:56:13,514
Where'd she go?

970
00:56:13,681 --> 00:56:15,683
To find a good place to be angry?

971
00:56:16,851 --> 00:56:19,520
Tonight, we go now
to a special remote interview...

972
00:56:19,687 --> 00:56:20,729
with Elastigirl.

973
00:56:20,896 --> 00:56:22,898
How you feeling, Chad? You doing all right?

974
00:56:23,065 --> 00:56:25,526
I'm fine. The doctors checked me out.

975
00:56:25,693 --> 00:56:27,570
I have no memory of the event.

976
00:56:27,695 --> 00:56:30,531
I gotta tell you, it's pretty strange
to see a recording...

977
00:56:30,739 --> 00:56:33,450
of yourself the night before
and have no recollection.

978
00:56:33,617 --> 00:56:35,327
I don't think anyone needs to worry.

979
00:56:35,494 --> 00:56:37,496
We've taken many precautions tonight though.

980
00:56:37,663 --> 00:56:38,956
Where are you right now?

981
00:56:39,123 --> 00:56:42,084
On a case, in a secure undisclosed location.

982
00:56:42,251 --> 00:56:43,586
I wanna talk about you...

983
00:56:43,752 --> 00:56:46,213
starting with your save of a runaway train.

984
00:56:46,380 --> 00:56:49,967
Here's an exclusive unedited clip
from your own suit cam.

985
00:56:50,134 --> 00:56:51,343
Roll the clip.

986
00:56:51,719 --> 00:56:53,012
This thing's really moving.

987
00:56:54,179 --> 00:56:56,640
100 and climbing. How much track is built?

988
00:56:56,807 --> 00:56:58,309
About 25 miles.

989
00:56:59,935 --> 00:57:02,855
The Screenslaver interrupts this program...

990
00:57:03,022 --> 00:57:04,273
for an important announcement.

991
00:57:04,440 --> 00:57:06,275
I'll be damned. She knew.

992
00:57:06,442 --> 00:57:07,985
Let's see if your gadget works.

993
00:57:08,152 --> 00:57:10,154
Don't bother watching the rest.

994
00:57:10,321 --> 00:57:11,030
Gotcha!

995
00:57:11,197 --> 00:57:13,657
Elastigirl doesn't save the day.

996
00:57:14,158 --> 00:57:16,785
She only postpones her defeat.

997
00:57:16,952 --> 00:57:19,121
And while she postpones her defeat...

998
00:57:19,288 --> 00:57:22,583
you eat chips
and watch her confront problems...

999
00:57:22,750 --> 00:57:25,002
that you are too lazy to deal with.

1000
00:57:25,169 --> 00:57:27,838
Superheroes
are part of your brainless desire...

1001
00:57:28,005 --> 00:57:30,549
to replace true experience with simulation.

1002
00:57:31,383 --> 00:57:34,386
You don't talk, you watch talk shows.

1003
00:57:34,845 --> 00:57:37,765
You don't play games, you watch game shows.

1004
00:57:38,265 --> 00:57:40,768
Travel, relationships, risk...

1005
00:57:41,602 --> 00:57:44,355
every meaningful experience
must be packaged...

1006
00:57:44,522 --> 00:57:47,316
and delivered to you to watch at a distance.

1007
00:57:47,858 --> 00:57:50,152
So that you can remain ever sheltered...

1008
00:57:50,319 --> 00:57:51,320
ever passive...

1009
00:57:52,112 --> 00:57:54,573
ever ravenous consumers...

1010
00:57:54,740 --> 00:57:57,243
who can't bring themselves
to rise from their couches...

1011
00:57:57,743 --> 00:58:01,080
break a sweat and participate in life.

1012
00:58:01,830 --> 00:58:03,916
You want superheroes to protect you...

1013
00:58:04,750 --> 00:58:08,629
and make yourselves ever more powerless
in the process.

1014
00:58:08,921 --> 00:58:11,549
While you tell yourselves
you're being looked after.

1015
00:58:12,466 --> 00:58:14,343
That your interests are being served.

1016
00:58:14,718 --> 00:58:17,304
And your rights are being upheld.

1017
00:58:17,471 --> 00:58:20,307
So that the system can keep stealing
from you...

1018
00:58:20,474 --> 00:58:23,310
smiling at you all the while.

1019
00:58:23,477 --> 00:58:26,856
Go ahead, send your Supers to stop me.

1020
00:58:27,022 --> 00:58:31,318
Grab your snacks, watch your screens,
and see what happens.

1021
00:58:31,485 --> 00:58:34,363
You are no longer in control.

1022
00:58:34,530 --> 00:58:35,906
I am.

1023
01:00:17,675 --> 01:00:19,260
Find anything?

1024
01:01:10,394 --> 01:01:11,270
Sorry!

1025
01:01:43,594 --> 01:01:44,803
What happened?

1026
01:01:44,970 --> 01:01:47,640
What happened is you destroyed my evidence.

1027
01:01:48,182 --> 01:01:49,642
What's going on? What did I do?

1028
01:01:49,808 --> 01:01:51,393
What did you guys do to me?

1029
01:01:51,560 --> 01:01:53,979
That's right, punk. Blame the system.

1030
01:01:55,189 --> 01:01:56,857
Your tracker worked like a charm, Evelyn.

1031
01:01:57,024 --> 01:01:58,025
You're a genius.

1032
01:01:58,192 --> 01:01:59,276
Aw, shucks!

1033
01:01:59,443 --> 01:02:01,904
I'm just the genius behind the genius.

1034
01:02:03,113 --> 01:02:04,406
Hey, Dad.

1035
01:02:04,573 --> 01:02:08,160
We're doing fractions and denismals
and percentages

1036
01:02:08,327 --> 01:02:09,328
and I don't get 'em.

1037
01:02:09,411 --> 01:02:10,538
Aren't you...

1038
01:02:10,621 --> 01:02:11,872
Didn't we get all caught up?

1039
01:02:12,039 --> 01:02:13,374
Yeah, we were caught up...

1040
01:02:13,541 --> 01:02:16,710
and now we're doing fractions
and percentages and demicels.

1041
01:02:16,877 --> 01:02:17,836
Decimals.

1042
01:02:18,003 --> 01:02:20,130
...the addition of the Incredibile,
the super car...

1043
01:02:20,297 --> 01:02:23,425
once driven by superhero, Mr. Incredible.

1044
01:02:23,592 --> 01:02:26,387
It's the kind of thing you buy
when you have everything else.

1045
01:02:26,554 --> 01:02:28,889
They said it was beyond repair.

1046
01:02:29,056 --> 01:02:30,140
It was in perfect condition.

1047
01:02:30,307 --> 01:02:31,851
You used to drive that?

1048
01:02:32,017 --> 01:02:33,644
They said it was destroyed.

1049
01:02:33,811 --> 01:02:37,439
Long thought lost or destroyed,
the famous car turned up at private auction.

1050
01:02:37,606 --> 01:02:38,899
They said it was...

1051
01:02:39,066 --> 01:02:40,484
That's my car!

1052
01:02:48,951 --> 01:02:51,495
Stupid water feature!

1053
01:02:51,662 --> 01:02:55,291
This car is just loaded with amazing gadgets.
Care to demonstrate?

1054
01:02:55,457 --> 01:02:58,752
I'd love to, but we haven't figured out
how to make them work yet.

1055
01:03:01,046 --> 01:03:03,048
Wow! It works?

1056
01:03:06,886 --> 01:03:10,347
What are you doing? This is not a toy!
That's a rocket launcher!

1057
01:03:10,514 --> 01:03:12,391
Sweet! Which one launches the rocket?

1058
01:03:12,558 --> 01:03:14,018
Hey! This is not your car!

1059
01:03:14,185 --> 01:03:15,519
It's not your car, either!

1060
01:03:15,686 --> 01:03:17,188
It is so! It's the Incredibile.

1061
01:03:17,354 --> 01:03:19,273
- Why's that guy have it?
- He shouldn't!

1062
01:03:19,440 --> 01:03:22,109
Launch the rockets! Launch the rockets!
Launch the rockets!

1063
01:03:22,276 --> 01:03:23,527
I'm not launching anything!

1064
01:03:23,694 --> 01:03:25,029
- I wanna blow it up!
- Do you think I want an angry rich guy...

1065
01:03:25,196 --> 01:03:26,780
coming after me right now...

1066
01:03:26,947 --> 01:03:28,365
- when I'm trying not to...
- I'm not sure

1067
01:03:28,490 --> 01:03:29,575
- what's happened here, Mark.
- ...distract your mother.

1068
01:03:29,658 --> 01:03:31,076
But everyone here has scattered

1069
01:03:31,160 --> 01:03:32,953
and I'm afraid I'll need
to move at any minute.

1070
01:03:33,704 --> 01:03:35,623
Rich guy got my car.

1071
01:03:37,666 --> 01:03:41,670
So, you're not gonna steal your car
back from the rich guy?

1072
01:03:50,471 --> 01:03:52,223
What the heck is that?

1073
01:03:56,143 --> 01:03:58,062
Jack-Jack has powers?

1074
01:03:58,229 --> 01:03:59,230
Yeah, but...

1075
01:03:59,396 --> 01:04:00,773
- You knew about this?
- Yeah.

1076
01:04:00,940 --> 01:04:02,525
- Why didn't you tell us?
- I don't know.

1077
01:04:02,691 --> 01:04:04,944
We're your kids.
We need to know these things.

1078
01:04:05,110 --> 01:04:06,320
- Did you tell Mom?
- No.

1079
01:04:06,487 --> 01:04:08,239
- Why not?
- Your mother is not...

1080
01:04:08,405 --> 01:04:10,366
- You'd want us to tell you, wouldn't you?
- Why would you not tell Mom?

1081
01:04:10,533 --> 01:04:12,326
- Because I didn't wanna...
- What?

1082
01:04:12,535 --> 01:04:13,744
- Come on, man.
- Because it's not the time.

1083
01:04:13,953 --> 01:04:14,870
- Why?
- Because...

1084
01:04:15,037 --> 01:04:17,456
- So uncool!
- Because I'm formulating, okay?

1085
01:04:18,374 --> 01:04:21,085
I'm taking in information, I'm processing!

1086
01:04:21,252 --> 01:04:23,170
I'm doing the math,
I'm fixing the boyfriend...

1087
01:04:23,337 --> 01:04:25,673
and keeping the baby
from turning into a flaming monster!

1088
01:04:25,839 --> 01:04:26,924
How do I do it?

1089
01:04:28,133 --> 01:04:30,219
By rolling with the punches, baby!

1090
01:04:30,386 --> 01:04:32,805
I eat thunder and crap lightning, okay?

1091
01:04:32,972 --> 01:04:34,682
'Cause I'm Mr. Incredible!

1092
01:04:34,848 --> 01:04:37,977
Not Mr. So-So or Mr. Mediocre-Guy.

1093
01:04:38,143 --> 01:04:40,688
Mr. Incredible!

1094
01:04:42,439 --> 01:04:43,983
We should call Lucius.

1095
01:04:44,567 --> 01:04:46,151
No. I can handle it.

1096
01:04:46,318 --> 01:04:48,153
There's no way I'm gonna...

1097
01:04:57,705 --> 01:04:59,331
Dada.

1098
01:05:00,249 --> 01:05:02,001
I'm calling Lucius.

1099
01:05:05,880 --> 01:05:08,340
Looks normal to me.
When did this start happening?

1100
01:05:08,507 --> 01:05:10,384
Since Helen got the job.

1101
01:05:10,551 --> 01:05:12,261
- I assume she knows?
- Are you kidding?

1102
01:05:12,428 --> 01:05:15,014
I can't tell her about this,
not while she's doing hero work!

1103
01:05:15,180 --> 01:05:16,015
Mama!

1104
01:05:16,181 --> 01:05:18,601
Girls, come on.
Leave the saving the world to the men?

1105
01:05:18,767 --> 01:05:20,019
- I don't think so.
- Mama!

1106
01:05:20,811 --> 01:05:22,438
I've got to succeed!

1107
01:05:22,605 --> 01:05:24,231
So she can succeed.

1108
01:05:24,398 --> 01:05:26,984
- So we can succeed!
- I get it, Bob!

1109
01:05:27,151 --> 01:05:29,653
I get it. When was the last time you slept?

1110
01:05:29,820 --> 01:05:31,405
Who keeps track of that?

1111
01:05:31,572 --> 01:05:35,326
Besides, he's a baby.
I can handle it, I got this handled.

1112
01:05:35,492 --> 01:05:37,453
So, you good then?

1113
01:05:37,620 --> 01:05:39,914
You got everything under control? Right?

1114
01:05:42,750 --> 01:05:43,459
What the...?

1115
01:05:44,460 --> 01:05:47,213
Cookie! Cha Cha want a cookie?

1116
01:05:47,379 --> 01:05:50,090
Num-num cookie? Cha Cha wanna num-num?

1117
01:05:50,257 --> 01:05:52,885
Num-num cookie! Cookie!

1118
01:05:53,052 --> 01:05:54,136
- You're not...
- Cookie!

1119
01:05:54,303 --> 01:05:55,638
- Oh, my God!
- Cookie!

1120
01:05:55,804 --> 01:05:57,389
Dada! Dada. Dada.

1121
01:05:57,556 --> 01:05:59,308
Okay! Okay.

1122
01:05:59,475 --> 01:06:01,268
So, he can still hear you from the...

1123
01:06:01,435 --> 01:06:03,312
From the other dimension, yeah.

1124
01:06:03,479 --> 01:06:05,481
That is freaky. I mean, that's not like...

1125
01:06:05,648 --> 01:06:08,526
Not like our other kids. No, it is not.

1126
01:06:08,692 --> 01:06:10,736
Full powers, totally random.

1127
01:06:11,237 --> 01:06:13,572
So now, he's what? Is he good?

1128
01:06:13,739 --> 01:06:15,783
Yeah, you'd think so, right?

1129
01:06:15,950 --> 01:06:18,494
Obviously, I can't keep giving him cookies!

1130
01:06:19,370 --> 01:06:20,746
But if I stop...

1131
01:06:24,416 --> 01:06:26,252
He is freaking! Again, he is freaking!

1132
01:06:26,418 --> 01:06:27,795
No biting the daddy!

1133
01:06:27,962 --> 01:06:28,963
- What the...?
- No biting!

1134
01:06:35,928 --> 01:06:36,971
Okay.

1135
01:06:38,847 --> 01:06:41,559
I think I just need a little bit of me time.

1136
01:06:41,725 --> 01:06:43,102
Then I'll be good to go.

1137
01:06:43,269 --> 01:06:45,354
You need more than me time, Bob.

1138
01:06:45,521 --> 01:06:48,524
You need major life realignment
on a number of levels.

1139
01:06:48,691 --> 01:06:51,193
Starting with baby superfreak here!

1140
01:06:51,360 --> 01:06:54,947
You need some solid outside-the-box thinking.

1141
01:07:03,789 --> 01:07:05,207
Galbaki?

1142
01:07:05,374 --> 01:07:09,336
Elastigirl's supersuit is by Galbaki?

1143
01:07:09,503 --> 01:07:10,880
Explain yourself!

1144
01:07:14,300 --> 01:07:16,760
Oh, my God. You're worse than I thought.

1145
01:07:16,927 --> 01:07:19,847
It's the baby. I brought the baby.

1146
01:07:21,765 --> 01:07:23,601
Highly unusual.

1147
01:07:31,108 --> 01:07:32,610
You look ghastly, Robert.

1148
01:07:32,776 --> 01:07:34,570
I haven't been sleeping.

1149
01:07:35,321 --> 01:07:38,657
I broke my daughter,
they keep changing math...

1150
01:07:38,824 --> 01:07:41,785
we needed double-A batteries,
but I got triple-A's...

1151
01:07:41,952 --> 01:07:44,663
and now we still need double-A batteries.

1152
01:07:44,830 --> 01:07:49,043
I put one red thing in a load of whites
and now everything's pink.

1153
01:07:49,210 --> 01:07:50,419
And I think we need eggs.

1154
01:07:50,586 --> 01:07:54,131
Done properly, parenting is a heroic act.

1155
01:07:54,298 --> 01:07:55,883
Done properly.

1156
01:07:56,050 --> 01:07:58,928
I am fortunate that it has
never afflicted me.

1157
01:07:59,094 --> 01:08:03,140
But you do not come to me
for eggs and batteries, Robert.

1158
01:08:03,307 --> 01:08:07,311
I design herowear and Elastigirl
must have a new suit.

1159
01:08:07,686 --> 01:08:09,522
Actually, it's Jack-Jack.

1160
01:08:10,105 --> 01:08:12,900
You also wish a new suit for the baby?

1161
01:08:13,067 --> 01:08:16,237
I would hardly classify this as an emergency.

1162
01:08:17,154 --> 01:08:19,615
Well, he's a special case. Worth studying.

1163
01:08:19,782 --> 01:08:21,534
If I could just leave him with you
for a while...

1164
01:08:21,700 --> 01:08:23,452
Leave him? Here?

1165
01:08:24,828 --> 01:08:26,872
I am not a baby person, Robert.

1166
01:08:27,039 --> 01:08:29,833
I have no baby facilities. I am an artist.

1167
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:32,836
I do not involve myself
in the prosaic day-to-day to...

1168
01:08:33,796 --> 01:08:35,005
day.

1169
01:08:38,467 --> 01:08:40,177
Fascinating!

1170
01:08:42,846 --> 01:08:44,682
Are you seeing this, Robert?

1171
01:08:46,475 --> 01:08:47,685
Dada.

1172
01:08:57,820 --> 01:08:59,446
Oh, my God.

1173
01:09:00,364 --> 01:09:01,407
Yes!

1174
01:09:02,116 --> 01:09:03,701
Of course you can leave the baby overnight.

1175
01:09:03,868 --> 01:09:06,453
I'm sure filling in for Helen
is challenging, and you are very tired...

1176
01:09:06,620 --> 01:09:08,873
and the other children need you
and miss you, and you must go to them.

1177
01:09:09,039 --> 01:09:10,624
Auntie Edna will take care of everything...

1178
01:09:10,791 --> 01:09:13,586
so, drive safely and goodbye.
I enjoy our visits.

1179
01:09:16,297 --> 01:09:18,257
"Auntie Edna"?

1180
01:09:22,595 --> 01:09:24,388
Attention. Attention.

1181
01:09:25,055 --> 01:09:27,349
I wanna thank everyone
that came out tonight...

1182
01:09:27,516 --> 01:09:29,018
in support of superheroes...

1183
01:09:29,185 --> 01:09:32,354
and bringing them back into society!

1184
01:09:32,521 --> 01:09:34,064
You all made it happen.

1185
01:09:34,231 --> 01:09:36,984
The need for this has been made
crystal clear in recent days...

1186
01:09:37,151 --> 01:09:40,905
with bad actors like the self-proclaimed
Screenslaver threatening our peace.

1187
01:09:41,071 --> 01:09:42,406
His reign was short, huh?

1188
01:09:43,365 --> 01:09:44,700
And thanks to this woman...

1189
01:09:44,867 --> 01:09:47,953
a great super. You love her. You missed her.

1190
01:09:48,120 --> 01:09:50,623
Welcome back, Elastigirl.

1191
01:09:51,957 --> 01:09:54,501
Come on up here. Don't be bashful.

1192
01:09:54,668 --> 01:09:56,253
Come on. Get up here.

1193
01:09:57,046 --> 01:09:59,548
I want you to have this.

1194
01:09:59,715 --> 01:10:01,467
A memento.

1195
01:10:01,634 --> 01:10:04,803
Thanks, Winston, Evelyn,
and everyone at DEVTECH.

1196
01:10:04,970 --> 01:10:06,764
I am forever in your debt.

1197
01:10:06,931 --> 01:10:11,519
And thanks to all of you, your pressure
changed all the right minds.

1198
01:10:11,936 --> 01:10:14,230
We've made amazing headway
in a very short time...

1199
01:10:14,396 --> 01:10:17,441
which leads me to an important announcement.

1200
01:10:17,608 --> 01:10:19,735
Just now, at a worldwide summit...

1201
01:10:19,902 --> 01:10:23,239
leaders from more than a hundred
of the world's top countries...

1202
01:10:23,405 --> 01:10:26,867
have agreed to make superheroes legal again!

1203
01:10:28,911 --> 01:10:31,747
We'll gather superheroes and leaders
from all over the planet...

1204
01:10:31,914 --> 01:10:33,457
on our boat, the Everjust...

1205
01:10:33,624 --> 01:10:37,002
for a televised signing ceremony at sea.

1206
01:10:37,169 --> 01:10:40,714
Now if you'll excuse us,
we got a ship to catch!

1207
01:10:44,301 --> 01:10:46,178
So good to see you. Thanks for coming out.

1208
01:10:46,345 --> 01:10:48,722
Hey. Hi, it's me, again.

1209
01:10:48,889 --> 01:10:51,392
There's something
I've always wanted to ask you.

1210
01:10:51,559 --> 01:10:55,271
Yeah, how do you balance the superhero stuff
with the life stuff?

1211
01:10:56,146 --> 01:10:57,982
I know I can handle the superhero stuff.

1212
01:11:02,444 --> 01:11:04,321
Would you please excuse me a moment?

1213
01:11:05,114 --> 01:11:07,199
Yeah, okay, see you later! Good talk!

1214
01:11:28,846 --> 01:11:29,972
Hey, Vi.

1215
01:11:30,139 --> 01:11:31,098
Hey.

1216
01:11:32,182 --> 01:11:33,184
Where's Jack-Jack?

1217
01:11:33,350 --> 01:11:34,768
E's taking him for a little bit.

1218
01:11:34,935 --> 01:11:36,395
Edna is babysitting?

1219
01:11:36,562 --> 01:11:37,396
Yeah.

1220
01:11:37,563 --> 01:11:39,481
And you're okay with this?

1221
01:11:39,648 --> 01:11:42,109
Yeah. I don't know why, but yeah.

1222
01:11:44,028 --> 01:11:46,488
I wanted to say something to you.

1223
01:11:47,781 --> 01:11:49,783
Sorry about Tony.

1224
01:11:50,409 --> 01:11:53,204
I didn't think about Dicker
erasing his memory...

1225
01:11:53,370 --> 01:11:56,207
or about you having to pay the price
for a choice...

1226
01:11:56,832 --> 01:11:59,960
you never made. It's not fair, I know.

1227
01:12:00,753 --> 01:12:04,089
And then, I made it worse at the restaurant
by trying to...

1228
01:12:04,340 --> 01:12:05,758
Anyway. Anyway...

1229
01:12:06,342 --> 01:12:07,968
I'm sorry.

1230
01:12:08,135 --> 01:12:11,388
I'm used to knowing
what the right thing to do is...

1231
01:12:11,555 --> 01:12:14,642
but now, I'm not sure anymore.

1232
01:12:14,808 --> 01:12:16,727
I just wanna be...

1233
01:12:19,063 --> 01:12:20,356
a good dad.

1234
01:12:24,360 --> 01:12:26,362
You're not good.

1235
01:12:28,489 --> 01:12:29,990
You're super.

1236
01:12:39,833 --> 01:12:42,628
Are superheroes allowed to drink on duty?

1237
01:12:42,795 --> 01:12:45,839
I'm definitely not on duty.
Ignore the costume.

1238
01:12:46,006 --> 01:12:48,050
I know I should be up there...

1239
01:12:48,217 --> 01:12:50,344
but I had to step away from the
grip and grins, you know?

1240
01:12:50,511 --> 01:12:53,430
Gotta get away to keep it pure. I know I do.

1241
01:12:53,597 --> 01:12:55,224
What are you getting away from?

1242
01:12:55,391 --> 01:12:58,519
You know, company stuff. My brother, mostly.

1243
01:12:58,686 --> 01:13:01,730
But you love him, you two
are this company. Yin and yang.

1244
01:13:01,897 --> 01:13:04,316
Yeah, I invent the stuff,
he's good at people.

1245
01:13:04,483 --> 01:13:08,612
Pleasing them, engaging them,
figuring out what they want.

1246
01:13:08,779 --> 01:13:10,447
I never know what people want.

1247
01:13:10,948 --> 01:13:12,449
What do you think they want?

1248
01:13:12,908 --> 01:13:17,037
Ease. People will trade quality
for ease every time.

1249
01:13:17,204 --> 01:13:20,374
It may be crap, but hey, it's convenient.

1250
01:13:20,541 --> 01:13:22,251
Yeah. Kind of like this case.

1251
01:13:22,418 --> 01:13:23,419
What? The Screenslaver?

1252
01:13:23,586 --> 01:13:26,797
Yeah, something's not sitting right.
It was too easy.

1253
01:13:26,964 --> 01:13:29,383
That was too easy? Wow.

1254
01:13:30,301 --> 01:13:32,219
- Funny.
- What?

1255
01:13:32,386 --> 01:13:33,804
Look at that.

1256
01:13:33,971 --> 01:13:37,766
One of Screenslaver's monitors
is tuned into my suit cam.

1257
01:13:37,933 --> 01:13:38,976
What?

1258
01:13:40,102 --> 01:13:41,937
Isn't the suit cam closed circuit?

1259
01:13:42,104 --> 01:13:43,063
It is.

1260
01:13:43,230 --> 01:13:45,566
Then how come Screenslaver has it?

1261
01:13:45,733 --> 01:13:47,318
Maybe he hacked it?

1262
01:13:47,484 --> 01:13:49,862
So, he's sophisticated enough to do that...

1263
01:13:50,029 --> 01:13:52,489
but he has simple locks on his doors?

1264
01:13:52,656 --> 01:13:54,533
Maybe he wanted you to find him.

1265
01:13:54,700 --> 01:13:56,035
He wanted to get caught?

1266
01:13:56,202 --> 01:13:58,204
He wanted you to win.

1267
01:13:58,370 --> 01:14:00,456
That makes no sense. He's a brilliant guy.

1268
01:14:00,623 --> 01:14:03,167
If he's smart enough to conceive
of technology like this...

1269
01:14:03,334 --> 01:14:05,836
he's smart enough to think
of something to do with it.

1270
01:14:06,003 --> 01:14:07,963
The guy we put in jail delivered pizzas.

1271
01:14:08,130 --> 01:14:08,964
So?

1272
01:14:09,131 --> 01:14:10,716
Einstein was a patent clerk.

1273
01:14:10,883 --> 01:14:12,927
Look, you won. You got the guy who...

1274
01:14:13,093 --> 01:14:16,472
Wait. All Screenslaver needs to do
to hypnotize someone...

1275
01:14:16,639 --> 01:14:18,724
is get a screen in front of their eyes.

1276
01:14:18,891 --> 01:14:22,895
But what if the screen doesn't
look like a screen?

1277
01:14:25,439 --> 01:14:29,568
What if the pizza guy
is really a pizza guy...

1278
01:14:29,735 --> 01:14:32,196
but he was controlled by the screens
built into his glasses...

1279
01:14:33,614 --> 01:14:35,449
You are good.

1280
01:14:39,787 --> 01:14:41,872
Look, the robot! It's taking off.

1281
01:14:42,039 --> 01:14:43,123
I'm not getting a reading yet.

1282
01:14:43,290 --> 01:14:44,833
- Press "fire"?
- Now!

1283
01:14:47,962 --> 01:14:49,046
More power.

1284
01:14:49,213 --> 01:14:50,631
I hope this works, Dad.

1285
01:14:52,007 --> 01:14:54,718
I thought it was best to just let you sleep.

1286
01:14:54,885 --> 01:14:56,971
Seventeen hours.

1287
01:14:57,763 --> 01:14:59,139
How do you feel?

1288
01:15:00,099 --> 01:15:01,225
Super.

1289
01:15:01,392 --> 01:15:03,435
- You got it, Dad.
- Hurray!

1290
01:15:04,436 --> 01:15:08,440
I can't tell you how much I appreciate
you watching Jack-Jack for me, E.

1291
01:15:08,607 --> 01:15:11,569
Yes, I'm sure your gratitude
is quite inexpressible.

1292
01:15:11,735 --> 01:15:14,738
Don't ask me to do it again, darling.
My rates are far too high.

1293
01:15:16,156 --> 01:15:18,409
I am joking, Robert.
I enjoyed the assignment.

1294
01:15:18,576 --> 01:15:20,286
He is bright and I am stimulating.

1295
01:15:20,452 --> 01:15:21,871
We deserve each other.

1296
01:15:22,538 --> 01:15:27,167
Your child is a polymorph.
Like all babies, he has enormous potential.

1297
01:15:27,334 --> 01:15:30,588
It is not unknown for supers
to have more than one power when young...

1298
01:15:30,754 --> 01:15:32,590
but this little one has many.

1299
01:15:33,507 --> 01:15:36,510
Yes, you have many powers.

1300
01:15:50,399 --> 01:15:53,736
I understand your lack of sleep
and coherency, Robert.

1301
01:15:53,903 --> 01:15:56,947
Babies can be anything,
and your child is no exception.

1302
01:15:57,114 --> 01:15:59,825
He has pure, unlimited potential, Robert.

1303
01:15:59,992 --> 01:16:02,912
He slept while I worked in a creative fever.

1304
01:16:03,078 --> 01:16:05,539
Auntie Edna stayed up all night...

1305
01:16:05,706 --> 01:16:08,209
making sure you look fabulous
in your many forms.

1306
01:16:08,375 --> 01:16:10,711
What are you... You're putting him in the...

1307
01:16:10,878 --> 01:16:12,087
In the chamber, Robert.

1308
01:16:12,254 --> 01:16:14,965
He is part of the demonstration
and will be fine.

1309
01:16:15,132 --> 01:16:18,636
Your challenge is to manage a baby
who has multiple powers...

1310
01:16:18,802 --> 01:16:21,180
and no control over them, yes?

1311
01:16:22,014 --> 01:16:23,390
That sums it up.

1312
01:16:23,557 --> 01:16:27,811
I often work to music and I noticed
the baby responds to it as well.

1313
01:16:27,978 --> 01:16:29,855
Specifically, Mozart.

1314
01:16:30,439 --> 01:16:33,567
I blended Kevlar with carbyne
for durability under duress...

1315
01:16:33,734 --> 01:16:35,653
and cotton for comfort.

1316
01:16:35,819 --> 01:16:38,948
Interwoven with these fabrics
are a mesh of tiny sensors...

1317
01:16:39,114 --> 01:16:42,076
that monitor the baby's physical properties.

1318
01:16:42,243 --> 01:16:45,120
Oh, Lord! What is he doing?

1319
01:16:45,287 --> 01:16:48,207
Well, it's Mozart, Robert. Can you blame him?

1320
01:16:48,374 --> 01:16:50,459
The important thing is that the suit
and tracker...

1321
01:16:50,626 --> 01:16:52,586
anticipated the change and alerted you.

1322
01:16:52,753 --> 01:16:55,297
Oh, no. Cookies. I gotta get cookies!

1323
01:16:55,464 --> 01:16:57,258
You do not need cookies.

1324
01:16:57,424 --> 01:16:59,677
As I learned quite painfully last night...

1325
01:16:59,843 --> 01:17:04,473
any solution involving cookies
will inevitably result in the demon baby.

1326
01:17:06,433 --> 01:17:07,768
"Combustion imminent"?

1327
01:17:07,935 --> 01:17:09,061
What does that mean?

1328
01:17:10,145 --> 01:17:13,983
It means fire, Robert, for which
the suit has countermeasures.

1329
01:17:14,149 --> 01:17:18,863
I suggest you extinguish the baby's flames
before he trips the sprinkler system.

1330
01:17:21,282 --> 01:17:24,910
The flame retardant
is blackberry lavender, darling.

1331
01:17:25,077 --> 01:17:27,746
Effective, edible, and delicious.

1332
01:17:27,913 --> 01:17:31,166
Well, what do you know? That is useful.

1333
01:17:31,333 --> 01:17:36,005
Although, I have doubtlessly exceeded your
expectations for a single night's work...

1334
01:17:36,171 --> 01:17:39,550
the suit and device contain
a few more features we need to discuss.

1335
01:17:39,717 --> 01:17:43,721
Thanks again, E, for everything.
How much do I owe you for...

1336
01:17:43,888 --> 01:17:46,724
Pish-posh, darling. Your bill
will be covered by my fee...

1337
01:17:46,891 --> 01:17:51,520
for being Mr. Incredible, Elastigirl,
and Frozone's exclusive designer...

1338
01:17:51,687 --> 01:17:53,981
throughout the known universe
and until the end of time.

1339
01:17:54,148 --> 01:17:56,025
But babysitting this one...

1340
01:17:56,192 --> 01:17:58,986
I do for free, darling.

1341
01:18:16,670 --> 01:18:19,089
I would resist the temptation to stretch.

1342
01:18:19,256 --> 01:18:22,301
The temperature around you
is well below freezing.

1343
01:18:22,468 --> 01:18:24,970
Try to stretch and you'll break.

1344
01:18:25,137 --> 01:18:27,640
So, you're the Screenslaver.

1345
01:18:27,806 --> 01:18:30,184
Yes and no.

1346
01:18:30,351 --> 01:18:34,730
Let's say, I created the character
and pre-recorded the messages.

1347
01:18:34,897 --> 01:18:36,273
Does Winston know?

1348
01:18:36,440 --> 01:18:39,193
That I'm the Screenslaver? Of course not.

1349
01:18:39,360 --> 01:18:43,572
Can you imagine what Mr. Free Enterprise
would do with my hypnosis technology?

1350
01:18:43,739 --> 01:18:45,032
Worse than what you're doing?

1351
01:18:45,199 --> 01:18:48,911
Hey, I'm using the technology
to destroy people's trust in it.

1352
01:18:49,161 --> 01:18:51,413
Like I'm using superheroes.

1353
01:18:51,580 --> 01:18:52,998
Who did I put in jail?

1354
01:18:53,165 --> 01:18:56,085
Pizza delivery guy.
Seemed the right height, build.

1355
01:18:56,252 --> 01:18:58,295
He gave you a pretty good fight.

1356
01:18:58,462 --> 01:19:01,507
I should say I gave you a pretty good fight
through him.

1357
01:19:01,674 --> 01:19:04,927
But it doesn't bother you
that an innocent man is in jail?

1358
01:19:05,177 --> 01:19:08,222
He was surly and the pizza was cold.

1359
01:19:08,305 --> 01:19:09,765
I counted on you.

1360
01:19:10,099 --> 01:19:11,350
That's why you failed.

1361
01:19:11,517 --> 01:19:12,601
What?

1362
01:19:12,768 --> 01:19:15,729
Why would you count on me?
Because I built you a bike?

1363
01:19:15,896 --> 01:19:19,149
Because my brother knows the words
to your theme song?

1364
01:19:19,316 --> 01:19:20,734
We don't know each other.

1365
01:19:20,901 --> 01:19:22,653
But you can count on me anyway.

1366
01:19:22,820 --> 01:19:24,280
I am supposed to, aren't I?

1367
01:19:24,446 --> 01:19:27,992
Because you have some strange abilities
and a shiny costume...

1368
01:19:28,158 --> 01:19:32,496
the rest of us are supposed
to put our lives into your gloved hands.

1369
01:19:32,663 --> 01:19:35,040
That's what my father believed.

1370
01:19:35,207 --> 01:19:38,669
When our home was broken into,
my mother wanted to hide.

1371
01:19:38,836 --> 01:19:41,130
Begged my father to use the safe room.

1372
01:19:41,297 --> 01:19:45,509
But Father insisted
they call his superhero friends.

1373
01:19:45,676 --> 01:19:50,055
He died, pointlessly, stupidly...

1374
01:19:50,639 --> 01:19:52,975
waiting for heroes to save the day.

1375
01:19:53,142 --> 01:19:55,978
- But why would you... Your brother...
- Is a child!

1376
01:19:56,812 --> 01:20:00,566
He remembers the time
when we had parents and superheroes.

1377
01:20:00,733 --> 01:20:04,486
So, like a child, Winston conflates the two.

1378
01:20:04,653 --> 01:20:08,115
Mommy and Daddy went away
because upers went away.

1379
01:20:08,282 --> 01:20:12,786
Our sweet parents were fools
to put their lives in anybody else's hands.

1380
01:20:13,078 --> 01:20:15,122
Superheroes keep us weak.

1381
01:20:15,956 --> 01:20:17,625
Are you gonna kill me?

1382
01:20:18,375 --> 01:20:19,376
Nah.

1383
01:20:21,420 --> 01:20:22,755
Using you is better.

1384
01:20:22,922 --> 01:20:25,799
You're gonna help me make supers illegal...

1385
01:20:25,966 --> 01:20:27,426
forever.

1386
01:20:32,431 --> 01:20:33,933
Dada. Dada.

1387
01:20:34,975 --> 01:20:37,019
Ready? Laser eyes.

1388
01:20:38,646 --> 01:20:39,438
Stop.

1389
01:20:39,605 --> 01:20:40,481
- Wow!
- Yeah!

1390
01:20:40,648 --> 01:20:41,565
Yay, Jack-Jack!

1391
01:20:41,732 --> 01:20:43,526
- Yeah, baby!
- And that's not all. Watch this.

1392
01:20:43,692 --> 01:20:45,402
Jack-Jack, blaster ready?

1393
01:20:50,241 --> 01:20:51,742
No way.

1394
01:20:51,909 --> 01:20:53,452
- That is crazy cool.
- My turn. I get to blast him first!

1395
01:20:53,619 --> 01:20:55,538
- Let me try. I want him. Give him to me.
- Hey, I'm just demonstrating.

1396
01:20:55,704 --> 01:20:58,457
No firing the baby around the house,
you understand?

1397
01:20:58,624 --> 01:21:01,168
This is potentially dangerous...

1398
01:21:01,335 --> 01:21:04,129
and we're trying to teach him
to control his powers, okay?

1399
01:21:04,296 --> 01:21:05,839
Stop. See the screen.

1400
01:21:08,092 --> 01:21:10,469
He vanished! That's really cool!

1401
01:21:10,636 --> 01:21:12,638
Okay, good. Use the thing.

1402
01:21:12,805 --> 01:21:14,890
That's the current readout. Click it.
See the readout?

1403
01:21:15,057 --> 01:21:16,851
Dimension four. See the shape?

1404
01:21:17,017 --> 01:21:18,769
That's the room. See where he is in relation?

1405
01:21:18,936 --> 01:21:19,937
So, where is he?

1406
01:21:21,605 --> 01:21:22,940
He's... there!

1407
01:21:24,149 --> 01:21:25,985
Okay. Come out. Num-num cookie?

1408
01:21:27,987 --> 01:21:29,363
- Yay, Jack-Jack!
- Yeah, Jack-Jack!

1409
01:21:29,530 --> 01:21:30,906
That's really cool.

1410
01:21:37,788 --> 01:21:38,664
Hello?

1411
01:21:38,831 --> 01:21:39,790
Elastigirl's in trouble.

1412
01:21:39,957 --> 01:21:41,292
What? What happened to her?

1413
01:21:41,458 --> 01:21:42,793
Sorry to tell you on the phone.

1414
01:21:42,960 --> 01:21:44,503
Meet me on our ship at DEVTECH.

1415
01:21:44,670 --> 01:21:46,755
The ship at DEVTECH.
I'll be there in 15 minutes.

1416
01:21:46,922 --> 01:21:48,883
What's at the ship at DEVTECH?

1417
01:21:49,049 --> 01:21:50,676
Lucius? Bob. Helen's in trouble.

1418
01:21:50,843 --> 01:21:52,261
I need someone to watch the kids.

1419
01:21:52,428 --> 01:21:53,804
Suit up. It might get weird.

1420
01:21:53,971 --> 01:21:55,681
I'll be there. ASAP. Fifteen tops.

1421
01:21:55,848 --> 01:21:59,143
Where are you going ASAP?
You better be back ASAP!

1422
01:21:59,310 --> 01:22:00,519
And leaving that suit.

1423
01:22:00,686 --> 01:22:02,188
I gotta go. I'll be home soon.

1424
01:22:02,354 --> 01:22:05,733
Lucius will be here sooner.
No firing the baby around the house, okay?

1425
01:22:05,900 --> 01:22:09,778
What's at the ship at DEVTECH?
And why are you in your Supersuit?

1426
01:22:22,041 --> 01:22:23,542
Is that Mom's supersuit?

1427
01:22:23,709 --> 01:22:25,336
She may need it. You never know.

1428
01:22:25,502 --> 01:22:27,129
What's going on?

1429
01:22:27,296 --> 01:22:31,133
I don't know, but Dad called Lucius
after getting a call about Mom...

1430
01:22:31,300 --> 01:22:32,426
and then left.

1431
01:22:32,593 --> 01:22:34,178
I thought you renounced superheroes.

1432
01:22:34,345 --> 01:22:37,264
Yeah, well, I renounce my renunciation.

1433
01:22:37,431 --> 01:22:38,599
Put that on.

1434
01:22:49,818 --> 01:22:52,238
Hello there, little fella.

1435
01:22:52,404 --> 01:22:53,948
Hello.

1436
01:22:54,114 --> 01:22:56,534
You kids aren't safe.
The Deavors sent us to take you...

1437
01:22:56,700 --> 01:22:59,453
Well, isn't that redundant?

1438
01:22:59,620 --> 01:23:02,331
The Deavors just sent me here
to guard the house.

1439
01:23:04,792 --> 01:23:07,378
'Cause the kids aren't safe.

1440
01:23:07,545 --> 01:23:09,421
I get it, managerial screw-up.

1441
01:23:09,588 --> 01:23:12,341
Tell Winston I handled it.
You understand, Ms...

1442
01:23:12,508 --> 01:23:13,759
Voyd.

1443
01:23:13,884 --> 01:23:15,469
Ms. Voyd.

1444
01:23:16,637 --> 01:23:17,596
Drive safely.

1445
01:23:27,523 --> 01:23:31,193
The thing is, he wants us to bring you, too.

1446
01:23:31,360 --> 01:23:32,403
Hey.

1447
01:23:34,154 --> 01:23:35,531
That isn't gonna hold them long.

1448
01:23:36,657 --> 01:23:38,284
Dash, grab the baby!

1449
01:23:41,078 --> 01:23:42,079
Spread out!

1450
01:23:44,540 --> 01:23:45,416
Whoa!

1451
01:23:46,667 --> 01:23:47,585
Dash!

1452
01:23:48,127 --> 01:23:49,503
We gotta get to my car.

1453
01:23:58,929 --> 01:24:00,890
What? What's going on?

1454
01:24:01,056 --> 01:24:02,141
Little fella!

1455
01:24:20,826 --> 01:24:21,952
It worked!

1456
01:24:28,125 --> 01:24:29,710
Incredibile, windows down!

1457
01:24:31,503 --> 01:24:32,421
Dive in!

1458
01:24:39,303 --> 01:24:43,140
Incredibile, set voice identification.
Loudly, say your names.

1459
01:24:43,307 --> 01:24:45,976
- Violet Parr.
- Dashiell Robert Parr.

1460
01:24:50,439 --> 01:24:51,398
Lucius!

1461
01:24:52,525 --> 01:24:53,609
Incredibile, escape!

1462
01:25:02,451 --> 01:25:03,285
Fill me in!

1463
01:25:03,452 --> 01:25:05,120
Good news and bad news. We found her.

1464
01:25:05,287 --> 01:25:08,207
She seems physically fine but
she's had an encounter with Screenslaver...

1465
01:25:08,374 --> 01:25:10,626
and she's acting kind of strange. In here.

1466
01:25:14,463 --> 01:25:15,589
Strange how?

1467
01:25:24,014 --> 01:25:24,932
Helen?

1468
01:25:25,975 --> 01:25:27,518
Helen, what are you...

1469
01:25:36,235 --> 01:25:37,486
Helen, it's me.

1470
01:25:54,587 --> 01:25:56,463
Incredibile, pull over.

1471
01:26:02,094 --> 01:26:04,179
We can't go to E's.

1472
01:26:04,346 --> 01:26:06,473
You saw those goggles they put on Lucius.

1473
01:26:06,640 --> 01:26:08,434
They were wearing them, too.

1474
01:26:08,601 --> 01:26:11,187
They're all under someone's control.

1475
01:26:11,353 --> 01:26:13,898
They've probably done the same to Mom.

1476
01:26:15,357 --> 01:26:17,443
Okay. Bad guys after us.

1477
01:26:17,610 --> 01:26:19,153
No Mom, no Dad.

1478
01:26:19,320 --> 01:26:20,446
No Lucius.

1479
01:26:20,613 --> 01:26:24,116
But we have our powers, this car...

1480
01:26:25,159 --> 01:26:28,662
and... what?

1481
01:26:40,799 --> 01:26:43,385
Incredibile, take us to DEVTECH.

1482
01:26:46,889 --> 01:26:50,559
The kids have escaped in a tricked-out car,
but we got Frozone.

1483
01:26:50,726 --> 01:26:53,521
Bring him to the ship at DEVTECH immediately.

1484
01:26:59,735 --> 01:27:01,028
We missed 'em!

1485
01:27:02,112 --> 01:27:05,574
I wish the Incredibile could
follow that boat.

1486
01:27:08,369 --> 01:27:10,037
- What did you do?
- I don't know.

1487
01:27:10,204 --> 01:27:12,831
- What did you do?
- I didn't do anything!

1488
01:27:20,548 --> 01:27:23,634
Wow, this car does anything I say.

1489
01:27:31,350 --> 01:27:33,102
We didn't plan this well.

1490
01:27:33,269 --> 01:27:34,562
What do you mean? We're here, aren't we?

1491
01:27:34,728 --> 01:27:36,188
Yes, we're here.

1492
01:27:36,355 --> 01:27:38,732
We need to be up there.

1493
01:27:39,692 --> 01:27:41,026
Hey...

1494
01:27:41,193 --> 01:27:44,655
What if the Incredibile has ejector seats?

1495
01:27:45,406 --> 01:27:46,782
Wait, what? No.

1496
01:27:46,991 --> 01:27:48,409
- Yeah, baby!
- No, don't say any more...

1497
01:27:48,576 --> 01:27:49,910
Max power! Launch!

1498
01:27:57,501 --> 01:27:58,794
Come on.

1499
01:28:02,047 --> 01:28:03,591
Hello! Glad you could come.

1500
01:28:03,757 --> 01:28:05,467
Welcome to the conference.

1501
01:28:16,020 --> 01:28:17,730
Our stars, where are they?

1502
01:28:17,938 --> 01:28:19,190
The event's about to start.

1503
01:28:19,356 --> 01:28:21,066
They didn't want to upstage the others.

1504
01:28:21,233 --> 01:28:22,943
They'll join for the signing.

1505
01:28:23,694 --> 01:28:26,238
Welcome, guests! You're in for a treat.

1506
01:28:26,447 --> 01:28:30,743
This ship is the largest hydrofoil
on the planet.

1507
01:28:30,910 --> 01:28:31,952
So, hold onto something...

1508
01:28:32,119 --> 01:28:34,538
because we're going to open her up!

1509
01:28:53,098 --> 01:28:55,392
We need to find Mom and Dad. Stay here.

1510
01:28:55,559 --> 01:28:56,519
I'm gonna search for them.

1511
01:28:56,685 --> 01:28:59,146
Wait! Who's gonna watch Jack-Jack?

1512
01:28:59,313 --> 01:29:01,190
Suck it up. I won't be long.

1513
01:29:01,357 --> 01:29:03,901
Wait. Wait, but, but wait!

1514
01:29:04,068 --> 01:29:06,612
This is important. They are in trouble.

1515
01:29:06,779 --> 01:29:09,490
It's up to us. To us, understand?

1516
01:29:09,657 --> 01:29:12,284
Keep him amused but quiet!

1517
01:29:25,464 --> 01:29:26,382
Quiet!

1518
01:29:32,846 --> 01:29:33,847
Jack-Jack?

1519
01:29:43,858 --> 01:29:45,693
Jack-Jack? Jack-Jack!

1520
01:30:19,226 --> 01:30:20,060
Jack-Jack!

1521
01:30:20,227 --> 01:30:21,812
The mesmerized supers know we're here...

1522
01:30:21,979 --> 01:30:23,230
but I found Mom and Dad...

1523
01:30:23,397 --> 01:30:24,356
Where's Jack-Jack?

1524
01:30:24,899 --> 01:30:27,776
You lost him? I gave you one thing to do!

1525
01:30:28,194 --> 01:30:29,570
The tracker. Use the tracker.

1526
01:30:33,657 --> 01:30:34,783
He's going up?

1527
01:30:34,950 --> 01:30:36,994
- He's in an elevator.
- Let's go!

1528
01:30:39,121 --> 01:30:41,665
Hey, little baby. Where are your parents?

1529
01:30:44,210 --> 01:30:46,212
And here they are, folks!

1530
01:30:46,378 --> 01:30:49,089
The supers who started this whole thing.

1531
01:30:49,256 --> 01:30:51,091
I told you they'd be there in time.

1532
01:30:51,258 --> 01:30:53,636
Hey, did you make them new masks?

1533
01:30:53,802 --> 01:30:56,722
Yeah. Night vision, et cetera...
They look good, right?

1534
01:30:56,889 --> 01:30:58,766
So simple, even he can do it.

1535
01:30:58,933 --> 01:31:02,770
And we're back live in three, two, one...

1536
01:31:02,937 --> 01:31:04,396
This is a momentous occasion.

1537
01:31:04,563 --> 01:31:09,610
We've all managed to accomplish something
extraordinarily rare in today's world.

1538
01:31:09,777 --> 01:31:11,529
We agree on something.

1539
01:31:14,698 --> 01:31:17,701
We agree to undo a bad decision.

1540
01:31:17,868 --> 01:31:20,829
To make sure
a few extraordinarily gifted members...

1541
01:31:20,996 --> 01:31:23,707
of the world's many countries
are treated fairly.

1542
01:31:23,874 --> 01:31:27,002
To invite them once again
to use their gifts...

1543
01:31:27,169 --> 01:31:28,504
to benefit the world.

1544
01:31:28,671 --> 01:31:33,092
I thank all of you for representing
your nation's commitment to superheroes.

1545
01:31:33,259 --> 01:31:35,386
With special thanks to Ambassador Selick.

1546
01:31:35,553 --> 01:31:37,263
Yeah, it's okay. Let her hear you.

1547
01:31:37,429 --> 01:31:38,681
Thank you. Thank you so much.

1548
01:31:38,847 --> 01:31:42,351
Thank you, Ambassador, for your early
and very crucial support.

1549
01:31:42,518 --> 01:31:44,937
I can't think of anyone
more deserving than you...

1550
01:31:45,104 --> 01:31:49,775
to be the first signature
on the International Superhero Accord.

1551
01:31:51,110 --> 01:31:52,987
There it is!

1552
01:32:07,626 --> 01:32:08,460
Holy cow!

1553
01:32:08,669 --> 01:32:10,963
I know he's on fire. Just put him out.

1554
01:32:18,220 --> 01:32:19,430
They're coming.

1555
01:32:28,981 --> 01:32:30,274
Is it okay to give him that?

1556
01:32:30,441 --> 01:32:32,818
I wasn't hearing any better ideas.

1557
01:32:57,509 --> 01:32:58,510
No!

1558
01:32:59,929 --> 01:33:01,931
Come on, Jack-Jack. We have to go.

1559
01:33:02,097 --> 01:33:03,265
Cookie num-num?

1560
01:33:15,945 --> 01:33:16,904
Mama, Mama.

1561
01:33:17,071 --> 01:33:18,489
I see him. He's getting away!

1562
01:33:18,656 --> 01:33:19,865
Stand back.

1563
01:33:23,994 --> 01:33:24,828
Darn it!

1564
01:33:24,995 --> 01:33:25,996
He's heading for Mom.

1565
01:33:28,582 --> 01:33:31,919
It is done. The world is super again.

1566
01:33:37,383 --> 01:33:39,677
Group photo. Come on. Group photo, everyone.

1567
01:33:39,843 --> 01:33:42,096
Squeeze in. That's it. Historic occasion.

1568
01:33:42,721 --> 01:33:44,223
Everyone, smile.

1569
01:33:50,980 --> 01:33:52,731
Go on phase two.

1570
01:33:52,898 --> 01:33:56,819
Years of mandated hiding and silence
have made us bitter.

1571
01:33:56,986 --> 01:33:58,612
You bring us out into the light...

1572
01:33:58,779 --> 01:34:02,157
only to clean up the messes
your lack of discipline creates.

1573
01:34:02,324 --> 01:34:04,827
Your bodies and your character are weak.

1574
01:34:04,994 --> 01:34:08,414
Your promises are empty,
and you will pay for it.

1575
01:34:08,581 --> 01:34:10,040
We no longer serve you.

1576
01:34:10,374 --> 01:34:13,836
We serve only us. May the fittest survive.

1577
01:34:17,756 --> 01:34:20,134
Some very alarming moments there...

1578
01:34:20,301 --> 01:34:22,803
before the technical difficulties.

1579
01:34:22,970 --> 01:34:24,346
Please bear with us.

1580
01:34:37,359 --> 01:34:38,402
What?

1581
01:34:39,111 --> 01:34:40,487
Mayday! Mayday! Mayday!

1582
01:34:40,654 --> 01:34:41,655
Hold! Let him talk.

1583
01:34:41,822 --> 01:34:43,782
Superheroes have forcibly
taken the bridge. Repeat.

1584
01:34:43,949 --> 01:34:44,825
Now.

1585
01:34:56,253 --> 01:34:57,713
A little further.

1586
01:34:57,880 --> 01:34:59,673
Little further. Stop.

1587
01:35:05,554 --> 01:35:07,514
What the... A baby?

1588
01:35:08,057 --> 01:35:09,934
Mom and Dad. Uncle Lucius?

1589
01:35:12,603 --> 01:35:14,146
- My mama.
- Jack-Jack, no!

1590
01:35:17,274 --> 01:35:18,984
A super baby?

1591
01:35:23,989 --> 01:35:25,282
No, no, no!

1592
01:35:25,449 --> 01:35:26,408
Put him down!

1593
01:35:28,369 --> 01:35:29,703
- Grab her!
- No!

1594
01:35:29,870 --> 01:35:30,871
Hold Jack-Jack.

1595
01:35:39,255 --> 01:35:40,172
No!

1596
01:35:42,007 --> 01:35:42,967
Hey, it's me!

1597
01:35:43,133 --> 01:35:44,677
Yeah, that's what I thought last time.

1598
01:35:45,719 --> 01:35:47,346
Kids, what are you...

1599
01:35:48,973 --> 01:35:51,058
You came for us?

1600
01:35:51,642 --> 01:35:52,643
Don't be mad.

1601
01:35:52,810 --> 01:35:55,396
Sweetie, how could I be mad?

1602
01:35:56,272 --> 01:35:57,731
I'm proud.

1603
01:35:58,732 --> 01:36:01,819
Not to break up a tender moment,
but where are we?

1604
01:36:01,986 --> 01:36:03,279
Is this DEVTECH's ship?

1605
01:36:03,696 --> 01:36:05,322
Evelyn Deavor controls the Screenslaver...

1606
01:36:05,489 --> 01:36:07,700
and until a second ago, us.

1607
01:36:09,451 --> 01:36:10,369
Where's the crew?

1608
01:36:10,536 --> 01:36:12,413
Collision detected. Correct course.

1609
01:36:12,580 --> 01:36:13,747
Uh-oh. Did I do that?

1610
01:36:13,914 --> 01:36:16,959
Mom, the suit? Try this.

1611
01:36:19,545 --> 01:36:21,755
Phase Three. Go on Phase Three!

1612
01:36:25,259 --> 01:36:27,428
Why are the kids here?
You didn't go to the house?

1613
01:36:27,595 --> 01:36:28,679
I went to the house.

1614
01:36:28,846 --> 01:36:30,306
You didn't escape? How did you not escape?

1615
01:36:30,472 --> 01:36:32,391
Hey! We just saved you!

1616
01:36:32,558 --> 01:36:34,602
Escape? Escape from who?

1617
01:36:37,521 --> 01:36:38,564
Those guys!

1618
01:36:41,317 --> 01:36:43,777
What the...? Jack-Jack has powers?

1619
01:36:43,944 --> 01:36:45,738
We know. Fight now, talk later.

1620
01:37:19,396 --> 01:37:20,814
Jack-Jack.

1621
01:37:20,981 --> 01:37:22,149
Laser eyes!

1622
01:37:50,177 --> 01:37:51,637
Come with me, Winston.

1623
01:37:52,263 --> 01:37:54,014
- Did I faint?
- You'll be safe here.

1624
01:37:54,181 --> 01:37:55,975
Safe? Safe from what?

1625
01:37:57,351 --> 01:37:59,353
Where are the diplomats? The supers?

1626
01:37:59,520 --> 01:38:00,646
Still hypnotized.

1627
01:38:01,647 --> 01:38:02,982
What have you done?

1628
01:38:07,444 --> 01:38:08,988
Evelyn, she's escaping.

1629
01:38:09,488 --> 01:38:11,615
Well, go after her. Finish your mission.

1630
01:38:11,782 --> 01:38:15,327
I can't just go! What about the kids?
Jack-Jack, who's gonna...

1631
01:38:15,494 --> 01:38:16,161
Mom!

1632
01:38:16,704 --> 01:38:18,497
Go. We've got this.

1633
01:38:20,374 --> 01:38:22,084
Voyd, come with me.

1634
01:38:22,251 --> 01:38:23,252
I'll go shut down the engine.

1635
01:38:23,419 --> 01:38:25,045
I'll try to slow the ship from the bow.

1636
01:38:25,212 --> 01:38:28,048
Wait, someone's missing.
Where's the crusher guy?

1637
01:38:28,257 --> 01:38:29,800
Strap in now!

1638
01:38:45,566 --> 01:38:46,817
It's for your own good.

1639
01:38:47,276 --> 01:38:48,611
No!

1640
01:38:49,028 --> 01:38:50,029
This is.

1641
01:39:01,665 --> 01:39:03,876
- We're too late.
- Get me up to the jet.

1642
01:39:27,942 --> 01:39:30,778
Hey, you did this. Can you undo it?

1643
01:39:30,945 --> 01:39:32,988
You want me to un-crush?

1644
01:39:33,155 --> 01:39:34,949
What? No one's ever asked for that?

1645
01:39:35,115 --> 01:39:37,743
No. To un-crush is silly. Why un-crush?

1646
01:39:37,910 --> 01:39:40,621
To get into the engine room.
Forget it. We don't have enough time.

1647
01:39:40,788 --> 01:39:44,208
What if I said to un-punch someone?
What do you do?

1648
01:39:48,045 --> 01:39:49,713
Welcome aboard, Elastigirl.

1649
01:39:49,880 --> 01:39:52,716
Although we haven't yet reached
our cruising altitude...

1650
01:39:54,218 --> 01:39:56,720
feel free to roam about the cabin.

1651
01:39:57,513 --> 01:39:59,098
Or just relax...

1652
01:39:59,265 --> 01:40:01,976
and let the cabin roam about you.

1653
01:40:11,151 --> 01:40:12,987
I can't get to the engine room!

1654
01:40:13,153 --> 01:40:16,073
We gotta do something!
Because trying to slow it down ain't working.

1655
01:40:16,240 --> 01:40:17,950
Hey! What about turning the boat?

1656
01:40:18,117 --> 01:40:19,243
The steering's been destroyed!

1657
01:40:19,410 --> 01:40:21,078
Dash means from the outside!

1658
01:40:21,245 --> 01:40:21,996
Yeah!

1659
01:40:22,162 --> 01:40:24,290
If we break off one of the foils
and turn the rudder...

1660
01:40:24,456 --> 01:40:26,458
we can veer the ship away from the city!

1661
01:40:26,876 --> 01:40:27,626
That might work.

1662
01:40:27,793 --> 01:40:29,128
I'll turn the front, you turn the rear.

1663
01:40:29,295 --> 01:40:32,673
Using the rudder? That's underwater.
How am I supposed to get...

1664
01:40:32,840 --> 01:40:34,758
All right. Come on, kids.

1665
01:40:34,925 --> 01:40:37,845
Dad, I know this is going to work.

1666
01:40:38,012 --> 01:40:40,347
But if it doesn't, and we crash...

1667
01:40:40,514 --> 01:40:43,726
my shields are probably better protection
than the ship.

1668
01:40:43,893 --> 01:40:47,146
I should stay here. With Jack-Jack.

1669
01:40:47,980 --> 01:40:49,148
That's my girl.

1670
01:40:49,440 --> 01:40:51,859
Remember, Bob, we're both turning right!

1671
01:40:58,574 --> 01:41:00,326
You know what's sad?

1672
01:41:03,996 --> 01:41:05,706
If it weren't for your core beliefs...

1673
01:41:05,873 --> 01:41:08,209
I think we could have been good friends.

1674
01:41:09,460 --> 01:41:10,753
At least...

1675
01:41:12,296 --> 01:41:14,089
I have core beliefs.

1676
01:41:15,799 --> 01:41:17,009
We have breaking news...

1677
01:41:17,176 --> 01:41:20,804
While there is still no radio contact,
the ship has changed direction...

1678
01:41:20,971 --> 01:41:23,515
and is heading towards land
at a high rate of speed.

1679
01:41:27,895 --> 01:41:29,146
So, Dash...

1680
01:41:30,606 --> 01:41:32,191
I am going to the rudder.

1681
01:41:32,358 --> 01:41:35,110
Once I turn the ship,
you hit the pull up button.

1682
01:41:35,277 --> 01:41:37,154
- Okay, Dad.
- Now lower me down...

1683
01:41:41,408 --> 01:41:44,745
The reputations of superheroes are ruined.

1684
01:41:44,912 --> 01:41:47,998
You will never become legal. Ever.

1685
01:41:48,541 --> 01:41:49,833
Never?

1686
01:41:50,292 --> 01:41:51,126
No.

1687
01:41:51,502 --> 01:41:53,212
- Ever?
- No.

1688
01:41:53,587 --> 01:41:56,674
Not even a little smidgee-widgee?

1689
01:41:56,840 --> 01:41:58,050
Hypoxia.

1690
01:41:58,217 --> 01:42:02,012
When you don't have enough oxygen,
things seem really silly.

1691
01:42:09,353 --> 01:42:12,690
Things get sillier and sillier
and then you die.

1692
01:42:12,857 --> 01:42:14,650
I don't wanna die.

1693
01:42:14,817 --> 01:42:15,776
Nobody does.

1694
01:42:17,361 --> 01:42:18,445
Really.

1695
01:42:18,946 --> 01:42:20,865
Not such a bad way to go.

1696
01:42:39,592 --> 01:42:41,802
Everyone, we need to get to the back
of the ship.

1697
01:42:41,969 --> 01:42:44,305
All supers, protect your ambassadors!

1698
01:42:45,264 --> 01:42:46,599
Follow.

1699
01:42:49,810 --> 01:42:51,812
Dad's been underwater for too long.

1700
01:42:59,945 --> 01:43:01,447
We gotta pull him up.

1701
01:43:01,614 --> 01:43:02,990
Wait. It's too soon.

1702
01:43:17,087 --> 01:43:18,380
I'm gonna press the button!

1703
01:43:18,547 --> 01:43:19,465
Not yet!

1704
01:43:34,605 --> 01:43:36,315
It's turning. It's working.

1705
01:43:40,194 --> 01:43:42,154
- Now!
- Dash, now!

1706
01:43:45,366 --> 01:43:46,700
Save yourself. Make a chute.

1707
01:43:50,120 --> 01:43:51,080
Make a chute. Make a chute.

1708
01:43:51,247 --> 01:43:52,289
Make a chute!

1709
01:43:55,084 --> 01:43:56,877
Helen! Brace yourselves!

1710
01:44:05,094 --> 01:44:06,679
Crash positions!

1711
01:44:27,992 --> 01:44:30,870
I missed Jack-Jack's first power?

1712
01:44:31,036 --> 01:44:33,414
Actually, you missed the first 17.

1713
01:44:46,969 --> 01:44:50,472
The fact that you saved me
doesn't make you right.

1714
01:44:51,473 --> 01:44:53,225
But it does make you alive.

1715
01:44:53,392 --> 01:44:54,852
And I'm grateful for that.

1716
01:44:55,352 --> 01:44:57,688
I'm sorry, but she'll go to prison.

1717
01:44:58,439 --> 01:45:02,276
Well, I'm sorry she's rich and will probably
get no more than a slap on the wrist.

1718
01:45:02,443 --> 01:45:05,196
First of all, Violet, I like you.

1719
01:45:05,362 --> 01:45:07,990
And who knows what the future may bring...

1720
01:45:08,157 --> 01:45:11,327
but I have a good feeling about all of you.

1721
01:45:12,119 --> 01:45:14,622
Good feeling. Should we be worried?

1722
01:45:15,164 --> 01:45:17,458
You guys got the next shift. I'm beat.

1723
01:45:17,791 --> 01:45:19,585
I saw what you did back there.
That was incredible!

1724
01:45:19,752 --> 01:45:20,961
No pun intended.

1725
01:45:21,128 --> 01:45:22,671
Sorry I had to punch you.

1726
01:45:24,340 --> 01:45:27,635
Yeah, baby! My sweet ride!

1727
01:45:40,105 --> 01:45:44,652
And in recognition of the extraordinary
service they have demonstrated...

1728
01:45:44,818 --> 01:45:49,490
the legal status of superheroes
is hereby restored.

1729
01:45:58,499 --> 01:46:00,292
You don't know me, do you?

1730
01:46:00,459 --> 01:46:01,627
No, I don't...

1731
01:46:01,794 --> 01:46:03,128
Wait.

1732
01:46:03,295 --> 01:46:05,047
Are you the girl with the water?

1733
01:46:05,214 --> 01:46:06,799
I'm Violet Parr.

1734
01:46:07,716 --> 01:46:09,301
- I'm Tony.
- Okay.

1735
01:46:09,468 --> 01:46:11,804
You split up into separate groups
and stuff...

1736
01:46:20,145 --> 01:46:22,523
- Tony, this is my mom.
- Pleased to meet you.

1737
01:46:22,690 --> 01:46:24,692
- This is my dad.
- We've met.

1738
01:46:24,859 --> 01:46:26,819
And this is embarrassing.

1739
01:46:26,986 --> 01:46:28,028
Charmed, I'm sure.

1740
01:46:28,195 --> 01:46:29,572
My little brother, Dash.

1741
01:46:30,406 --> 01:46:32,283
And the baby is Jack-Jack.

1742
01:46:32,449 --> 01:46:35,578
I tried to limit it to one parent.

1743
01:46:35,744 --> 01:46:38,122
We're all going to a movie, too, Tony.
Don't mind us.

1744
01:46:38,289 --> 01:46:40,541
We'll be sitting
on the other side of the theater.

1745
01:46:40,708 --> 01:46:42,251
Not watching you.

1746
01:46:43,419 --> 01:46:47,214
He's kidding. They are only
dropping us off at the theater.

1747
01:46:47,381 --> 01:46:50,050
They have other things to do.

1748
01:46:50,217 --> 01:46:52,636
So, you guys are close, I guess.

1749
01:46:52,803 --> 01:46:53,762
Yeah, I guess.

1750
01:46:53,929 --> 01:46:54,930
We can get closer.

1751
01:46:55,097 --> 01:46:56,098
Bob.

1752
01:47:11,113 --> 01:47:12,239
Stop! Let us out!

1753
01:47:12,406 --> 01:47:13,949
Here, large popcorn, small soda.

1754
01:47:14,116 --> 01:47:16,160
Save me a seat, center,
about eight rows back.

1755
01:47:16,702 --> 01:47:19,622
I'll be back before the previews are over.
