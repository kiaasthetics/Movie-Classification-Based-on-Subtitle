738

739
00:57:22,690 --> 00:57:23,820
I did.

740
00:57:24,150 --> 00:57:26,360

741
00:57:26,486 --> 00:57:27,726
How long has he been out there?

742
00:57:28,488 --> 00:57:29,528
Six years.

743
00:57:30,323 --> 00:57:31,323
Six years?

744
00:57:31,866 --> 00:57:35,076
Nobody can survive
in that forest for six years.

745
00:57:35,161 --> 00:57:36,201

746
00:57:36,871 --> 00:57:38,871
Well... He says...

747
00:57:41,334 --> 00:57:43,754
He says he wasn't alone.

748
00:57:46,840 --> 00:57:47,840
He drew this?

749
00:57:49,342 --> 00:57:52,182
He says it's his friend from the forest.

750
00:57:52,512 --> 00:57:53,932
And it reminded me of...

751
00:57:54,013 --> 00:57:55,853
I know what it reminded you of.

752
00:57:57,183 --> 00:57:58,233

What I remember?

766
00:58:31,801 --> 00:58:34,721
What I remember is, I was out hunting...

767
00:58:36,055 --> 00:58:37,595
and the sun was shining down...

768
00:58:38,224 --> 00:58:39,702
and wind was blowing through the trees.

769
00:58:39,726 --> 00:58:42,436
And I remember thinking,
"Boy, this is exactly where I belong."

770
00:58:43,605 --> 00:58:45,605
I stopped by a creek to get a drink.

771
00:58:45,773 --> 00:58:47,693
Suddenly I realize
I wasn't in the sun anymore...

772
00:58:47,775 --> 00:58:49,935
and I looked up to see
what was blocking the sky.

773
00:58:50,111 --> 00:58:53,911
And what did I see but a dragon?

774
00:58:54,991 --> 00:58:56,581
I see a dragon.

775
00:58:58,494 --> 00:59:00,084
I've never been so scared in my life.

776
00:59:01,581 --> 00:59:04,291
But when I raised my gun to shoot...

777
00:59:04,459 --> 00:59:08,089
suddenly there was this feeling, this...

778
00:59:09,172 --> 00:59:10,672
It was like magic.

779
00:59:11,591 --> 00:59:14,261
There's no other word to express it.
It was magic.

780
00:59:15,970 --> 00:59:18,810
So, I put my gun down
and just sat there...

781
00:59:18,973 --> 00:59:23,653
and we sat there across the creek
from each other just looking.

782
00:59:24,312 --> 00:59:26,112
I just sat there looking.

783
00:59:26,272 --> 00:59:29,152
And then the dragon turned
and disappeared into the woods.

784
00:59:29,317 --> 00:59:31,687
And I remember thinking,
"I am one lucky guy."

785
00:59:35,323 --> 00:59:36,823
Of course, nobody believed me.

786
00:59:37,533 --> 00:59:39,203
I knew what people
were saying about me.

787
00:59:39,369 --> 00:59:42,089
I must admit, there were times
when I thought, "Maybe they're right."

788
00:59:42,163 --> 00:59:44,833
But then I thought about the magic.

789
00:59:45,667 --> 00:59:47,707
It changed the way I see the world...

790
00:59:47,877 --> 00:59:49,837
the way I see trees,
the way I see sunshine...

791
00:59:50,004 --> 00:59:51,554
the way, even, I see you.

792
00:59:54,008 --> 00:59:56,048
I wouldn't trade that for anything.

793
00:59:59,806 --> 01:00:02,556
So, I'm not gonna try to
convince you. I quit that.

794
01:00:02,892 --> 01:00:08,402
But maybe if you
could just be open to looking.

795
01:00:11,317 --> 01:00:12,987
I know those woods.

796
01:00:15,321 --> 01:00:17,821
I know those woods
like the back of my hand.

797
01:00:20,326 --> 01:00:22,156
I couldn't have missed a dragon.
