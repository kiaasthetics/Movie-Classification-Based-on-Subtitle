Puss in Boots! Puss in Boots!

14
00:02:20,599 --> 00:02:23,852
Welcome to my fiesta!

Make yourselves at home, yeah!

16

Come on, eat.

17
00:02:28,231 --> 00:02:30,317
Drink up.

18
00:02:33,403 --> 00:02:35,030
Good to see you again.

19
00:02:38,116 --> 00:02:40,118
Papa! He stepped on my face!

20
00:02:40,202 --> 00:02:42,537
And we will never wash it again.

You are still here?

96
00:08:31,886 --> 00:08:34,597
Okay, okay. One more number.

97
00:08:34,681 --> 00:08:37,976
I call this one
"The Legend Will Never Die."

98
00:08:40,228 --> 00:08:42,105
Puss in Boots!

99
00:08:44,149 --> 00:08:46,317
Puss.

100
00:08:47,027 --> 00:08:48,028
Puss?

101
00:08:48,820 --> 00:08:49,821
Puss in Boots?

102
00:08:55,952 --> 00:08:57,871
Where-- Where am I?

103
00:08:57,954 --> 00:09:00,331
Not to worry.
You're in good hands.

104
00:09:00,415 --> 00:09:01,750
My hands!

105
00:09:01,833 --> 00:09:04,044
I am the village doctor.

106
00:09:04,127 --> 00:09:07,380
I am also the village barber,
veterinarian, dentist and witch-finder.

107
00:09:08,715 --> 00:09:11,509
And in my professional opinion...

108
00:09:11,593 --> 00:09:14,888
...you need a wash, a blow out
and a little trim around the hindquarters.

109
00:09:14,971 --> 00:09:17,432
-Uh...
-That's my professional barber opinion.

110
00:09:17,515 --> 00:09:22,353
But putting on my doctor's hat,
I think we need to run a few tests.

111
00:09:22,979 --> 00:09:25,982
All right. Reflexes.

112
00:09:26,066 --> 00:09:27,650
Cat-like. Temperature.

113
00:09:27,734 --> 00:09:29,986
Now lift your tail and relax.

114
00:09:30,737 --> 00:09:33,740
Trust me. I run hot. Yep.

115
00:09:33,823 --> 00:09:37,285
Then how about the latest
in modern medical technology?

116
00:09:37,368 --> 00:09:40,538
Leeches!
To draw out the evil humors.

117
00:09:41,664 --> 00:09:43,166
Suit yourself. More for me.

118
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:45,752
Uh, listen, Doctor.

119
00:09:45,835 --> 00:09:48,421
Thanks for everything,
but I am feeling great.

120
00:09:48,505 --> 00:09:50,715
Strong, like a bull! You know?

121
00:09:50,799 --> 00:09:54,385
Now, do you know a good place
to get some gazpacho?

122
00:09:54,469 --> 00:09:56,262
Please. This is serious.

123
00:09:56,346 --> 00:09:57,597
What is it?

124
00:09:57,680 --> 00:10:00,433
Puss in Boots, how do I say this?

125
00:10:02,268 --> 00:10:03,269
You died.

126
00:10:05,647 --> 00:10:07,565
Doctor, please.

127
00:10:08,483 --> 00:10:11,361
Relax! I am Puss in Boots.

128
00:10:11,444 --> 00:10:13,196
I laugh at death!

129
00:10:14,447 --> 00:10:15,448
You see?

130
00:10:15,532 --> 00:10:19,244
And anyway, I am a cat.
I have nine lives.

131
00:10:19,327 --> 00:10:21,412
And how many times
have you died already?

132
00:10:21,496 --> 00:10:25,500
Uh... I don't know. I never counted.

133
00:10:25,583 --> 00:10:28,503
-I am not really a math guy, you know?
<i>-Gato!</i>

134
00:10:28,586 --> 00:10:32,006
Take it easy, Doctor.
Let's see...

135
00:10:32,090 --> 00:10:34,592
There was the running of the bulls
in Pamplona.

136
00:10:36,928 --> 00:10:39,097
<i>Hola, señorita.</i>

137
00:10:39,180 --> 00:10:40,640
Do you like gazpacho?

138
00:10:42,308 --> 00:10:45,270
Guess it's not your night, huh, fellas?

139
00:10:48,731 --> 00:10:52,569
I am telling you,
a cat always lands on his feet!

140
00:10:52,652 --> 00:10:53,653
Watch!

141
00:10:57,699 --> 00:11:00,451
No! Puss in Boots doesn't need a spotter.

142
00:11:00,535 --> 00:11:01,536
Watch!

143
00:11:04,164 --> 00:11:07,750
No need to pull into port.
This will revolutionize travel.

144
00:11:07,834 --> 00:11:08,960
Watch!

145
00:11:10,628 --> 00:11:13,590
Uh, excuse me,
does this have shellfish in it?

146
00:11:13,673 --> 00:11:15,008
Yes, sir.

147
00:11:15,091 --> 00:11:15,967
Meh!

148
00:11:17,635 --> 00:11:19,929
Puss, I think you set
the oven too high!

149
00:11:20,013 --> 00:11:23,266
-I am a master of the baking. Watch!
-Whoa!

150
00:11:24,934 --> 00:11:26,644
And then there was the giant today.

151
00:11:28,104 --> 00:11:31,232
So what is that? Like, uh, four?

152
00:11:31,858 --> 00:11:35,153
That makes eight, Puss.
You are down to your last life.

153
00:11:35,737 --> 00:11:38,364
My prescription,
no more adventures for you.

154
00:11:38,448 --> 00:11:39,699
You need to retire.

155
00:11:39,782 --> 00:11:41,659
Me? Retire?

156
00:11:41,743 --> 00:11:43,536
Are you the village comedian as well?

157
00:11:43,620 --> 00:11:46,623
Puss. Is there any safe place you can go?

158
00:11:46,706 --> 00:11:49,626
Any special someone you can rely on
in this moment of need?

159
00:11:50,376 --> 00:11:54,672
I am Puss in Boots,
loved by one and all.

160
00:11:54,756 --> 00:11:56,341
Anyone in particular?

161
00:11:56,424 --> 00:12:00,428
I mean, how could I possibly choose?

162
00:12:01,221 --> 00:12:04,224
Mm-hmm.
This is the address of Mama Luna.

163
00:12:04,807 --> 00:12:07,810
She is a cat fancier,
always on the lookout for a new lap-cat.

164
00:12:07,894 --> 00:12:08,978
You will be safe there.

165
00:12:09,062 --> 00:12:10,146
Lap-cat?

166
00:12:10,230 --> 00:12:12,106
I am no lap-cat, Doctor.

167
00:12:12,190 --> 00:12:14,400
I am Puss in Boots!

168
00:12:14,484 --> 00:12:15,902
Not anymore.

169
00:12:15,985 --> 00:12:19,197
Barber's orders.
I mean, doctor's orders.

170
00:12:19,989 --> 00:12:21,199
And remember, Puss.

171
00:12:22,033 --> 00:12:25,328
Death comes for us all. Treat?

172
00:12:26,079 --> 00:12:28,706
You really got to work on
your bedside manner.

173
00:12:40,843 --> 00:12:44,514
Ha! I am Puss in Boots!
I am no one's lap-cat.

174
00:12:46,474 --> 00:12:48,601
That doctor is a quack and a crazy man.

175
00:12:48,685 --> 00:12:50,478
He should stick to cutting hair.

176
00:12:50,561 --> 00:12:52,188
Last call, <i>Señor Boots.</i>

177
00:12:52,272 --> 00:12:55,191
Another glass of cream.
Make it your heaviest.

178
00:12:55,275 --> 00:12:57,360
Oh! I keep the heavy stuff in the back.

179
00:13:02,031 --> 00:13:04,075
Huh! Retire.

180
00:13:04,158 --> 00:13:06,661
You are too good-looking to retire.

181
00:13:18,548 --> 00:13:23,094
Well, well, if it isn't
Puss in Boots himself.

182
00:13:24,929 --> 00:13:26,389
In the flesh.

183
00:13:27,181 --> 00:13:29,142
Uh, hey.

184
00:13:30,101 --> 00:13:31,978
There's the famous hat.

185
00:13:32,061 --> 00:13:33,146
The feather.

186
00:13:33,229 --> 00:13:35,982
And of course, the boots.

187
00:13:37,191 --> 00:13:40,528
My compliments to your cobbler.

188
00:13:40,611 --> 00:13:45,158
Thanks. Good to meet you too.

189
00:13:47,744 --> 00:13:51,706
Hey, I never do this,
but can I get your autograph?

190
00:13:51,789 --> 00:13:55,209
Been following you for a long time.

191
00:13:56,044 --> 00:13:58,254
Sign right there.

192
00:14:00,465 --> 00:14:05,219
Puss in Boots
laughs in the face of death,

193
00:14:05,303 --> 00:14:06,512
bounty hunter.

194
00:14:07,096 --> 00:14:08,598
So I've heard.

195
00:14:09,182 --> 00:14:12,226
You will find
your reward does not come easily,

196
00:14:12,310 --> 00:14:13,853
this I tell you.

197
00:14:14,437 --> 00:14:18,191
Everyone thinks they'll be the one
to defeat me,

198
00:14:18,775 --> 00:14:20,526
but no one's escaped me yet.

199
00:14:21,861 --> 00:14:23,905
All right, let's get it over with.

200
00:14:23,988 --> 00:14:25,823
Fear me, if you dare...

201
00:14:32,663 --> 00:14:35,416
Okay, no more messing around. Huh!

202
00:14:39,087 --> 00:14:42,298
Slow. Sloppy. Sad.

203
00:14:53,851 --> 00:14:55,311
Yow!

204
00:14:55,395 --> 00:14:57,939
You're not living up to the legend, <i>gato.</i>

205
00:15:31,639 --> 00:15:35,643
I just love the smell of fear.

206
00:15:45,611 --> 00:15:48,906
What's the matter?

207
00:15:48,990 --> 00:15:51,784
Lives flashing before your eyes?

208
00:15:54,328 --> 00:15:55,329
Pick it up.

209
00:15:56,289 --> 00:15:59,917
Pick... it... up.

210
00:17:25,169 --> 00:17:27,004
I am no longer worthy.

211
00:17:27,547 --> 00:17:28,548
I'm sorry.

212
00:17:37,557 --> 00:17:40,268
We are gathered here today
to say goodbye

213
00:17:41,352 --> 00:17:43,187
to Puss in Boots.

214
00:17:43,271 --> 00:17:46,566
There are no words
to express such a loss.

215
00:17:47,692 --> 00:17:48,693
Thank you.

216
00:17:53,406 --> 00:17:55,491
But it would be a crime not to try.

217
00:17:56,117 --> 00:17:58,869
He was known across the land
by many names.

The <i>Leche</i> Whisperer.

To more, a hero.

223

To all, a legend.

224
00:18:11,507 --> 00:18:15,011
I was right.
Words were not enough.

225
00:18:18,139 --> 00:18:20,391

Me, I don't have a name.
Or a home.

285
00:22:59,378 --> 00:23:02,298
So, I'm no expert,
but you don't look like a "Pickles."

286
00:23:02,381 --> 00:23:05,551
Well, you don't look like a cat.

287
00:23:05,634 --> 00:23:08,137
Okay, okay, okay. Full disclosure.

288
00:23:08,220 --> 00:23:09,889
I'm not a cat. I'm a dog.

Hi, Bon Bon.

291
00:23:12,516 --> 00:23:17,354
Oh! Pickles has a new girlfriend? Okay.

292
00:23:17,438 --> 00:23:20,357
I live under the porch.
It can get a little lonely down there.

293
00:23:20,441 --> 00:23:22,318
It's mostly controlled
by the rats and the centipedes,

294
00:23:22,401 --> 00:23:23,777
but I have my own little corner.

295
00:23:23,861 --> 00:23:25,112
Congratulations.

296
00:23:25,195 --> 00:23:27,406
I just come up here
for the food and the friends.

297
00:23:28,616 --> 00:23:29,909
Mostly-- Mostly the food.

298
00:23:29,992 --> 00:23:32,161
Please don't tell anyone. I need this.

299
00:23:32,244 --> 00:23:34,121
I won't tell. I don't care.

300
00:23:34,204 --> 00:23:37,291
So you'll keep my secret?
A secret between friends?

301
00:23:37,374 --> 00:23:38,751
Just a secret.

302
00:23:38,834 --> 00:23:41,712
It's funny.
Despite all this best friend bonding,

303
00:23:41,795 --> 00:23:43,505
you're still a mystery to me, Pickles.

304
00:23:43,589 --> 00:23:44,757
What's your story?

305
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:46,717
My story...

306
00:23:48,886 --> 00:23:50,429

...it's over.

308
00:23:53,682 --> 00:23:55,100
Oh, no.

309
00:23:55,684 --> 00:23:56,727
Wanna rub my belly?

310
00:23:58,228 --> 00:23:59,063
Hmm?

311
00:23:59,146 --> 00:24:00,648
What... What's happening?

312
00:24:00,731 --> 00:24:02,524
-Rub.
-Hard pass.

313
00:24:02,608 --> 00:24:04,652
Come on, rub. I need the practice.

314
00:24:04,735 --> 00:24:06,487
I'm gonna be a therapy dog someday.

315
00:24:06,570 --> 00:24:07,947
What the hell are you talking about?

316
00:24:08,030 --> 00:24:09,198
I'm glad you asked.

317
00:24:09,281 --> 00:24:11,617
When people feel bad,
they can rub my belly.

318
00:24:11,700 --> 00:24:12,910
It'll make 'em feel better.

319
00:24:12,993 --> 00:24:13,994
-Rub my belly.
-No.

320
00:24:14,078 --> 00:24:15,579
-Come on! Rub it.
-No. Not happening.

321
00:24:15,663 --> 00:24:16,497
-Rub it!
-No!

322
00:24:16,580 --> 00:24:20,668
Let me be clear.
I don't want to touch your belly, okay?

323
00:24:20,751 --> 00:24:23,253
Okeydoke. So, what do you want?

324
00:24:23,337 --> 00:24:26,423
I want to be left alone.

325
00:24:48,153 --> 00:24:49,196
You're back.

326
00:24:49,279 --> 00:24:50,823
Oh, I never left.

327
00:25:04,378 --> 00:25:06,255

We've got an offer for him.

331
00:25:23,772 --> 00:25:26,567
What could they possibly
want to offer Puss in Boots?

332
00:25:26,650 --> 00:25:27,860
What's a Puss in Boots?

333

there are no cats here!

337
00:25:38,203 --> 00:25:40,456
We're looking for
the legendary Puss in Boots.

338
00:25:40,539 --> 00:25:42,875
Have you perhaps... seen him?

339
00:25:42,958 --> 00:25:44,126
Too soft.

00:26:43,894 --> 00:26:45,938
I'll be outside.

360
00:26:46,021 --> 00:26:48,148
My cats can play better than you!

361
00:26:48,232 --> 00:26:49,942
♪ <i>Now's the time to roll out the barrel♪</i>

362
00:26:50,025 --> 00:26:51,401
Goldi, is this him?

363
00:26:51,485 --> 00:26:53,570
That's a dog in a cat costume.

364
00:26:53,654 --> 00:26:55,280
Oh, yeah.

365
00:26:55,364 --> 00:26:56,740
Tricky little bugger.

366
00:26:56,824 --> 00:26:58,408
How about this one? He's a ginger.

367
00:27:01,203 --> 00:27:02,204
Is that a joke?

368
00:27:02,287 --> 00:27:05,374
You think this scruffy,
geriatric bag of bones

369
00:27:05,457 --> 00:27:06,792
looks like a legend?

370
00:27:06,875 --> 00:27:08,377
This is definitely not...

371
00:27:08,460 --> 00:27:10,712
Puss in Boots! I found him!

372
00:27:11,964 --> 00:27:14,883
Puss in Boots, dead and buried.

373
00:27:14,967 --> 00:27:17,261
Dead? No, no, no. He can't be.

374
00:27:17,344 --> 00:27:20,472
Yep. The nose never lies.

375
00:27:20,556 --> 00:27:21,890
Well, that's that, then.

376
00:27:21,974 --> 00:27:23,559
What say we go
and hibernate, eh?

377
00:27:23,642 --> 00:27:24,726
No!

378
00:27:24,810 --> 00:27:28,272
The map is being delivered tonight
and we have one chance to steal it.

379
00:27:28,355 --> 00:27:30,524
Without it,
we'll never find the Wishing Star.

380
00:27:31,108 --> 00:27:34,194
The Wishing Star. It does exist.

381
00:27:34,278 --> 00:27:36,405
That star has one wish to grant.

382
00:27:36,488 --> 00:27:37,781
One wish?

383
00:27:37,865 --> 00:27:39,867
Think of what that could mean for us.

384
00:27:39,950 --> 00:27:42,327
Nine lives! Yes!

385
00:27:42,411 --> 00:27:45,831
Well, I don't see why we needed
to hire Puss in Boots in the first place.

386
00:27:45,914 --> 00:27:49,501
Ugh. Because nobody steals
from Big Jack Horner.

387
00:27:49,585 --> 00:27:51,962
No! Not Jack Horner.

388
00:27:52,045 --> 00:27:54,798
Don't worry, love.
We'll get that wish somehow.

389
00:27:54,882 --> 00:27:55,966
Thank you, Mama.

390
00:27:56,049 --> 00:27:58,635
Yeah. Because I've got a plan.

391
00:27:58,719 --> 00:28:00,846
I can nick a map
as good as any old cat.

392
00:28:00,929 --> 00:28:04,391
You've got a plan?

393
00:28:04,474 --> 00:28:06,685
What? I'm smart, ain't I?
Ain't I, Papa?

394
00:28:06,768 --> 00:28:10,355
No. You ain't well fixed for brains.

395
00:28:10,439 --> 00:28:14,026
- Robbing Big Jack Horner.
- Very risky.

396
00:28:14,109 --> 00:28:17,279
But that wish could get me my lives back.

397
00:28:17,362 --> 00:28:18,906
And my life back!

398
00:28:18,989 --> 00:28:20,699
Goodbye, Pickles!

399
00:28:20,782 --> 00:28:22,492
Oh, no, Pickles, you're leaving?

400
00:28:22,576 --> 00:28:24,411
<i>Perro,</i> start digging.

401
00:28:24,494 --> 00:28:25,537
Okay.

402
00:28:26,205 --> 00:28:28,373
But if this Puss in Boots
is such a big deal,

403
00:28:28,457 --> 00:28:30,083
maybe we shouldn't be
desecrating his grave.

404
00:28:30,792 --> 00:28:32,586
I don't think he would mind

405
00:28:32,669 --> 00:28:34,213
because he...

406
00:28:36,423 --> 00:28:37,966
is me!

407
00:28:39,134 --> 00:28:41,762
Oh! Okay.

408
00:28:41,845 --> 00:28:43,597
Oh, yeah. Uh...

409
00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:47,142
Normally, I have a sword.
It's like a whole thing, you know.

410
00:28:47,226 --> 00:28:49,102
Pickles, you're Puss in Boots?

411
00:28:49,186 --> 00:28:50,938
Not yet! But I will be.

412
00:28:51,021 --> 00:28:53,106
I'll come... I'll come with you.

413
00:28:53,190 --> 00:28:54,191
Sorry, <i>Perro.</i>

414
00:28:54,274 --> 00:28:56,401
Puss in Boots walks alone!

415
00:29:04,243 --> 00:29:05,494
Open the gates!

416
00:29:17,381 --> 00:29:21,969
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Hands off the merchandise. We got this.

417
00:29:22,052 --> 00:29:25,222
Okay. Just get in and get out. Easy peasy.

418
00:29:25,305 --> 00:29:26,974
Lemon squeezy.

419
00:29:27,057 --> 00:29:28,809
What are you doing here?

420
00:29:28,892 --> 00:29:30,185
I brought you a sword.

421
00:29:30,269 --> 00:29:32,312
That's not a sword. That's a stick.

422
00:29:32,396 --> 00:29:33,563
It's a stick-sword.

423
00:29:33,647 --> 00:29:34,648
Go home.

424
00:29:34,731 --> 00:29:36,149
My home is where my friends are.

425
00:29:36,233 --> 00:29:37,859
Again. Not friends.

426
00:29:37,943 --> 00:29:41,446
- Rub for luck?
- I don't need luck for this.

427
00:29:41,530 --> 00:29:43,699
I am a highly skilled, master cat thief.

428
00:29:43,782 --> 00:29:44,783
Watch!

429
00:29:45,659 --> 00:29:48,578
Mm-hmm.

430
00:29:48,662 --> 00:29:49,788
You got this.

431
00:30:05,679 --> 00:30:08,307
Mmm.

432
00:30:08,390 --> 00:30:10,976
I pronounce this batch...

433
00:30:11,810 --> 00:30:12,811
delicious.

434
00:30:15,856 --> 00:30:17,274
Ship 'em out!

435
00:30:19,109 --> 00:30:20,944
Mr. Horner.

436
00:30:21,028 --> 00:30:23,447
The Serpent Sisters got the goods.

437
00:30:23,530 --> 00:30:27,534
Is it? Is it the map to the Wishing Star?

438
00:30:27,617 --> 00:30:29,870
Stop everything. You two, come with me.

439
00:30:29,953 --> 00:30:32,122
We must get this to the trophy room.

440
00:30:32,205 --> 00:30:35,709
You know, it took a lot of murdering
to get this map.

441
00:30:35,792 --> 00:30:36,877
It all started...

442
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:38,754
Take it to the trophy room!

443
00:30:49,181 --> 00:30:51,933
What the...

444
00:30:52,017 --> 00:30:55,270
Wow. Look at all the magic stuff.

445
00:30:55,354 --> 00:30:58,565
Yes, I collect enchanted objects,
magical icons,

446
00:30:58,648 --> 00:31:01,777
bobbles, and geegaws,
and la-di-da and blah blah blah.

447
00:31:01,860 --> 00:31:04,696
Check it out!
I'm walking on a magic carpet.

448
00:31:04,780 --> 00:31:08,158
Sweet.
The shrunken ship of the Lilliputians.

449
00:31:08,241 --> 00:31:11,453
Shut up! Are those unicorn horns?

450
00:31:11,536 --> 00:31:13,121
Baby unicorn horns.

451
00:31:13,205 --> 00:31:15,374
Half as heavy, twice as sharp.

452
00:31:15,457 --> 00:31:16,583
Savage.

453
00:31:16,666 --> 00:31:18,126
Ah! They're trinkets!

454
00:31:18,210 --> 00:31:21,880
They're nothing compared to the awesome
power of the magic Wishing Star.

455
00:31:21,963 --> 00:31:23,840
Speaking of which,
make with the box, Sister.

456
00:31:23,924 --> 00:31:25,092
You got it, boss.

457
00:31:25,175 --> 00:31:28,720
Like I was saying,
the amount of murdering we...

458
00:31:28,804 --> 00:31:30,806
Make with the box!

459
00:31:31,515 --> 00:31:36,686
After so many years of searching,
this is my moment.

460
00:31:37,437 --> 00:31:41,066
With this wish, I will finally be

461
00:31:41,149 --> 00:31:43,693
the master of all magic!

462
00:31:43,777 --> 00:31:45,028
Hey, Little Jack?

463
00:31:47,364 --> 00:31:49,741
-Excuse me?
-Could you do the thumb thing?

464
00:31:49,825 --> 00:31:51,493
-Shh!
-Like in the fairy tale?

465
00:31:51,576 --> 00:31:54,746
It wasn't a fairy tale!
It was only a nursery rhyme.

466
00:31:54,830 --> 00:31:57,165

What's impressive?
I've been a boy the whole time.

475
00:32:20,814 --> 00:32:24,359
Little Jack Horner didn't have any magic.

476
00:32:24,443 --> 00:32:28,405
He was a pathetic,
buttered baker's boy.

Little Jack's dead!
I'm Big Jack Horner.

Ah! Mr. Big Jack Horner, sir...

479
00:32:36,997 --> 00:32:38,540
I barely know her.

We're sisters, you goof.

481
00:32:42,377 --> 00:32:43,879

-Puss?
-Kitty?

484
00:32:51,887 --> 00:32:54,181
-Puss.
-Kitty!

485

This is my job!

00:33:00,854 --> 00:33:03,648
No, this is my job.
I'm double-crossing the Bears.

487

No, I'm double-crossing the Bears.

488
00:33:05,358 --> 00:33:07,444
They tried to hire me earlier today.

489
00:33:07,527 --> 00:33:09,321
Well, they tried to hire me two weeks ago.

490
00:33:09,404 --> 00:33:11,323
That makes you plan B.

491
00:33:11,406 --> 00:33:12,657
Aha!

492
00:33:12,741 --> 00:33:14,201
There it is!

493
00:33:14,284 --> 00:33:15,160
Phew!

494
00:33:15,243 --> 00:33:17,454
Now, about your payment...

495
00:33:17,537 --> 00:33:20,874
Hold up. You promised us
our weight in gold.

496
00:33:20,957 --> 00:33:22,209
I did, didn't I?

497
00:33:22,292 --> 00:33:24,336
Ever hear of the Midas Touch?

498
00:33:24,419 --> 00:33:26,671
Ah, cool, dibs!

499
00:33:27,464 --> 00:33:30,217
Oh, no! I misjudged the situation!

500
00:33:30,300 --> 00:33:33,345
This is why
you don't cross Jack Horner.

501
00:33:33,428 --> 00:33:36,181
-What is this? Are you a pirate now?
-Shh.

502
00:33:36,264 --> 00:33:38,934
It's like a possum crawled
on your face and died.

503
00:33:39,017 --> 00:33:40,018
Shh.

504
00:33:40,101 --> 00:33:41,102
Of shame.

505
00:33:41,186 --> 00:33:42,854
Please, mock me quietly.

506
00:33:42,938 --> 00:33:44,606
I hate it. It's disgusting.

507
00:33:44,689 --> 00:33:47,150
Well, I love it. It's distinguished.

508
00:33:55,617 --> 00:33:58,745
Great plan, Baby. Real cat-like.

509
00:34:03,959 --> 00:34:07,170
Uh... Can I... go?

510
00:34:07,254 --> 00:34:08,922

-Puss in Boots?
-Goldi. Bears.

00:34:13,343 --> 00:34:14,553
Hola, Jack.

Kitty Softpaws.

514
00:34:16,555 --> 00:34:19,808
My, you have a lot of nerve
coming back here.

515
00:34:19,891 --> 00:34:22,185
Please.
I was the best thief you ever hired.

516
00:34:22,269 --> 00:34:23,186
You robbed me!

517
00:34:23,270 --> 00:34:24,354
You set me up.

518
00:34:24,437 --> 00:34:27,107
You said you were going on
some spiritual retreat.

519
00:34:27,190 --> 00:34:28,191
Namaste.

520
00:34:28,275 --> 00:34:30,235
And you're supposed to be dead.

521
00:34:30,318 --> 00:34:31,361
I got better?

522
00:34:31,444 --> 00:34:32,654
Ugh! Just give us the map.

523
00:34:32,737 --> 00:34:34,364
And throw in a dozen pies.

524
00:34:34,447 --> 00:34:36,116
-Ooh! Have you got any savory pies?
-What?

525
00:34:36,199 --> 00:34:37,617
-Yeah, what flavors you got?
-No!

526
00:34:37,701 --> 00:34:39,244
Can we get all of that in a bag to go?

527
00:34:39,327 --> 00:34:42,038
Ah! Would you stop talking
about blooming pies!

528
00:34:42,122 --> 00:34:43,331
Focus!

529
00:34:43,415 --> 00:34:46,126
Hand over that map,
or I'll punch holes in the lot of ya.

530
00:34:47,502 --> 00:34:48,753
Oh, bums.

531
00:34:48,837 --> 00:34:50,422
Look out! It's coming down!

532
00:34:54,259 --> 00:34:59,806
Ha! I hate talking fairy-tale animals.

533
00:35:03,476 --> 00:35:04,894
Puss, get back here!

534
00:35:04,978 --> 00:35:06,730
The best thief has won.

535
00:35:07,355 --> 00:35:09,024
- Huh?
- You're right.

536
00:35:09,107 --> 00:35:10,483
She did.

537
00:35:10,567 --> 00:35:11,651
Oh, come on!

538
00:35:13,153 --> 00:35:14,738
There! They're getting away!

539
00:35:23,747 --> 00:35:25,874
Ooh!

540
00:35:25,957 --> 00:35:27,667
No, no, no, no, no, no!

541
00:35:29,628 --> 00:35:31,379
Nice catching up with you, Puss!

542
00:35:31,463 --> 00:35:32,464
Gotta go!

543
00:35:34,257 --> 00:35:36,259
Here, kitty-kitty.

544
00:35:37,510 --> 00:35:40,847
Is that a stick?
What are you gonna do with that? Ow!

545
00:35:40,930 --> 00:35:42,223
Ow! Me knuckles!

546
00:35:43,475 --> 00:35:45,018
You shouldn't have done that, mate.

547
00:35:45,101 --> 00:35:46,061
Heh.

548
00:35:48,396 --> 00:35:49,481
This idiot.

549
00:35:55,445 --> 00:35:57,197
Hey, Puss! I found a sandwich in here.

550
00:35:57,280 --> 00:35:58,657
-I think it's tuna fish.
-Drive, <i>Perro!</i>

551
00:35:58,740 --> 00:35:59,574
Okeydoke.

552
00:36:08,166 --> 00:36:10,502
Oh, cool! Another member of the team!

553
00:36:10,585 --> 00:36:13,004
- We are not a team!
- Eyes on the road!

554
00:36:13,088 --> 00:36:14,089
Who is this guy?

555
00:36:14,172 --> 00:36:16,341
-I'm Puss's best friend.
-No! He isn't.

556
00:36:16,424 --> 00:36:18,927
-And his therapy dog.
-Definitely not!

557
00:36:19,010 --> 00:36:21,179
Finally! You need therapy.

558
00:36:24,349 --> 00:36:25,850
Give me the map. Trust me.

559
00:36:25,934 --> 00:36:28,853
Trust you? Like I did in Santa Coloma?

560
00:36:28,937 --> 00:36:30,063
Really? Santa Coloma?

561
00:36:30,146 --> 00:36:32,190
<i>Sí,</i> Santa Coloma!

562
00:36:36,152 --> 00:36:37,153
-Mine!
-Mine!

563
00:36:37,237 --> 00:36:38,279
-Mine!
-Mine!

564
00:36:54,212 --> 00:36:59,092
Good people, accept this golden gift
from Puss in Boots!

565
00:37:11,563 --> 00:37:13,273
Speed up! Go, go, go!

566
00:37:16,693 --> 00:37:20,238
Assemble the Baker's Dozen.

567
00:37:21,322 --> 00:37:23,324
Careful with this.

568
00:37:23,408 --> 00:37:26,453
I'll take this and that, oh, and these!

569
00:37:26,536 --> 00:37:28,246
One of those, and I gotta take that.

570
00:37:28,329 --> 00:37:30,206
Yes. Yes. No.

571
00:37:30,290 --> 00:37:31,499
Yes!

572
00:37:31,583 --> 00:37:32,500
Oh, yeah!

573
00:37:35,670 --> 00:37:37,255
And all of these!

574
00:37:37,338 --> 00:37:39,799
This one is right.

575
00:37:52,645 --> 00:37:57,984
I'll get you, my kitties,
and your little dog too.

576
00:38:03,239 --> 00:38:04,532
What?

577
00:38:04,616 --> 00:38:07,368
This is blank. We've been ripped off!

578
00:38:07,452 --> 00:38:08,745
Where is the...

579
00:38:09,412 --> 00:38:11,915
Oh. Yeah.
I knew it was gonna do that.

580
00:38:11,998 --> 00:38:14,834
"The Dark Forest is deep and far.

581
00:38:14,918 --> 00:38:17,504
Within its bounds, you'll find the star."

582
00:38:17,587 --> 00:38:22,509
Ugh. The Dark Forest?
No one goes into the Dark Forest.

583
00:38:22,592 --> 00:38:23,843
Or comes out.

584
00:38:24,385 --> 00:38:26,971
"A single wish burns true and bright.

585
00:38:27,055 --> 00:38:29,849
This map's the key, so hold on tight."

586
00:38:32,894 --> 00:38:34,187
You let go!

587
00:38:34,270 --> 00:38:37,357
A stick?
What happened to your sword?

588
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:40,527
Got rid of it, you know.
Made things too easy.

589
00:38:40,610 --> 00:38:41,820
I needed a challenge.

590
00:38:41,903 --> 00:38:44,072
Yeah.
You looked pretty challenged back there.

591
00:38:44,155 --> 00:38:47,325
There's no way
I'm letting you hold the map!

592
00:38:47,408 --> 00:38:49,994
Well, there's no way
I'm letting you hold the map!

593
00:38:50,078 --> 00:38:51,079
I can hold it.

594
00:38:52,372 --> 00:38:55,291
Yeah, right. What's your deal anyway?

595
00:38:55,375 --> 00:38:56,751
You run with the Chihuahua Gang?

596
00:38:56,835 --> 00:38:58,127
I don't think so.

597
00:38:58,211 --> 00:38:59,212
I don't believe you.

598
00:38:59,295 --> 00:39:02,340
That's okay.
As long as you believe in yourself.

599
00:39:02,423 --> 00:39:05,760
What? Is he deranged?

600
00:39:05,844 --> 00:39:07,512
-Yep.
-What's your name?

601
00:39:07,595 --> 00:39:09,639
Oh. I've been called all kinds of things.

602
00:39:09,722 --> 00:39:12,642
Dog. Bad Dog. Stupid Dog.
Hey You! You There!

603
00:39:12,725 --> 00:39:14,394
Get Out! Leave It! Drop It!

604
00:39:14,477 --> 00:39:15,728
Big Rat. Small Pig.

605
00:39:15,812 --> 00:39:18,273
Rat Face. Butt Nugget. for Brains.

606
00:39:18,356 --> 00:39:20,149
You know, that sort of thing.

607
00:39:20,233 --> 00:39:22,610
But I've never had a name
that really stuck, you know?

608
00:39:23,194 --> 00:39:24,571
That belonged to me.

609
00:39:25,154 --> 00:39:25,989
Is he done?

610
00:39:26,072 --> 00:39:27,031
And you are?

611
00:39:27,115 --> 00:39:30,118
Softpaws. Kitty Softpaws.

612
00:39:30,201 --> 00:39:32,704
Wow! Yeah. Now, that's a good name.

613
00:39:32,787 --> 00:39:34,247
There's music in a name like that.

614
00:39:34,330 --> 00:39:36,749
Kitty Softpaws.

615
00:39:36,833 --> 00:39:39,586
Nice try. Classic con.

616
00:39:39,669 --> 00:39:40,670
No one's that dumb.

617
00:39:40,753 --> 00:39:42,171
No one's that nice.

618
00:39:42,255 --> 00:39:43,298
I don't trust you.

619
00:39:43,381 --> 00:39:45,800
Me neither. He cannot be trusted.

620
00:39:45,884 --> 00:39:49,220
But I trust him more than I trust you.

621
00:39:49,304 --> 00:39:52,432
Wow. This trip is going to be fun.

622
00:40:25,840 --> 00:40:28,760
This must be the Dark Forest.

623
00:40:40,146 --> 00:40:42,065
-Oh, my God!
-It's gone!

624
00:40:42,148 --> 00:40:43,524
It's back!

625
00:40:43,608 --> 00:40:46,027
Nothing to worry about.

626
00:40:47,820 --> 00:40:49,197
We step through as one.

627
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:52,241
Ready? One, two... After you.

628
00:40:52,325 --> 00:40:53,326
Wait, what?

629
00:40:56,579 --> 00:40:58,623
Dog? Still alive?

630
00:40:58,706 --> 00:40:59,749
Let's go find out.

631
00:40:59,832 --> 00:41:01,000
Wait!

632
00:41:08,883 --> 00:41:10,301
Um...

633
00:41:11,678 --> 00:41:13,638
Whoa.

634
00:41:13,721 --> 00:41:14,764
Wow.

635
00:41:14,847 --> 00:41:19,227
For a Dark Forest,
this place is pretty colorful.

636
00:41:19,310 --> 00:41:21,354
I wish I had my quinceañera here.

637
00:41:21,437 --> 00:41:24,607
The Wishing Star is in here, somewhere.

638
00:41:24,691 --> 00:41:27,443
Kitty, may I please see the map?

639
00:41:27,527 --> 00:41:28,778
-No.
-Seriously?

640
00:41:28,861 --> 00:41:31,197
You won't let me hold it
for even one minute?

641
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:33,199
Nope. Not even for one second.

642
00:41:33,282 --> 00:41:37,578
Come on, Kitty. You've got to trust me.

643
00:41:38,788 --> 00:41:41,040
Wait. What-- What's--
What's going on with his eyes?

644
00:41:41,124 --> 00:41:43,334
Oh, they're getting bigger.

645
00:41:43,418 --> 00:41:45,837
Oh, Kitty!

646
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:48,006
You gotta trust him.
Look at those eyes.

647
00:41:48,089 --> 00:41:50,508
Really? You call that cute?

648
00:41:50,591 --> 00:41:53,678
Oh, look at her!

649
00:41:53,761 --> 00:41:56,556
Those eyes are even bigger than yours.

650
00:41:56,639 --> 00:41:57,849
Do whatever she wants, Puss.

651
00:41:58,558 --> 00:42:00,977
Wait a second. So poofy!

652
00:42:01,060 --> 00:42:03,354
No! With the paws?

653
00:42:03,438 --> 00:42:04,856
Come on!

654
00:42:04,939 --> 00:42:06,774
With the hat?

655
00:42:06,858 --> 00:42:09,610
It's all so cute!

656
00:42:09,694 --> 00:42:12,572
Cuteness overload!

657
00:42:14,198 --> 00:42:15,825
Can we look at the map now?

658
00:42:20,580 --> 00:42:22,790
"Follow this enchanted chart.

659
00:42:22,874 --> 00:42:26,419
It knows your path and knows your heart."

660
00:42:27,295 --> 00:42:29,047
Is that us?

661
00:42:44,645 --> 00:42:47,732
It says we must go
through the Valley of Incineration,

662
00:42:47,815 --> 00:42:49,484
over Undertaker Ridge,

663
00:42:49,567 --> 00:42:51,402
through the Cave of Lost Souls?

664
00:42:51,986 --> 00:42:53,654
- Really?
- Let me take a look.

665
00:43:07,752 --> 00:43:11,172
What? Swamp of Infinite Sorrows?

666
00:43:11,255 --> 00:43:13,091
Mountains of Misery?

667
00:43:13,174 --> 00:43:15,426
The Abyss of Eternal Loneliness?

668
00:43:15,510 --> 00:43:17,678
There's something wrong with this map.

669
00:43:17,762 --> 00:43:20,389
I guess there is a different
terrible path for everyone.

670
00:43:20,473 --> 00:43:23,684
It's almost like the forest
doesn't want anyone to make a wish.

671
00:43:24,227 --> 00:43:26,687
Well, I don't even have a wish.
But can I try?

672
00:43:33,611 --> 00:43:35,238
Ooh! Mine says...

673
00:43:35,321 --> 00:43:37,031
...we skip through
the Pocket Full O' Posies.

674
00:43:37,115 --> 00:43:38,241
What?

675
00:43:38,324 --> 00:43:40,493
Then drift down
the River of Relaxation.

676
00:43:40,576 --> 00:43:41,744
-That sounds fun.
-No fair.

677
00:43:41,828 --> 00:43:43,246
Why does he get the good ones?

678
00:43:43,329 --> 00:43:45,456
Wander the Fields
of Quick and Easy Solutions

679
00:43:45,540 --> 00:43:46,999
and arrive at the star!

680
00:43:47,083 --> 00:43:48,501
Oh, wow!

681
00:43:48,584 --> 00:43:49,794
That sounds wonderful.

682
00:43:49,877 --> 00:43:52,755
Oh, but no. This is your quest.
I don't wanna impose.

683
00:43:52,839 --> 00:43:54,257
You hold the map.

684
00:43:54,340 --> 00:43:55,967
-Really?
-But don't you cross me.

685
00:43:56,050 --> 00:44:00,304
-Or your name will be <i>Perro Muerto.</i>
-Okeydokey.

686
00:44:03,266 --> 00:44:05,143
Wait. Is that...

687
00:44:07,311 --> 00:44:09,355
It's raining bears. Time to go.

688
00:44:10,064 --> 00:44:12,984
I'm telling ya, when we get that wish,

689
00:44:13,067 --> 00:44:15,695
it will make everything just right
for all of us.

690
00:44:15,778 --> 00:44:17,155
Will it make us rich?

691
00:44:17,238 --> 00:44:19,448
Rich enough to hibernate
all year round?

692
00:44:19,532 --> 00:44:20,575
The richest.

693
00:44:20,658 --> 00:44:22,743
Will we be, like, big-time thieves?

694
00:44:22,827 --> 00:44:24,954
The biggest.

695
00:44:25,037 --> 00:44:27,123
Here, you know that suit
Jack Horner wears?

696
00:44:27,206 --> 00:44:28,749
-Yeah.
-I'm gonna have one of them.

697
00:44:28,833 --> 00:44:30,960
-Yeah?
-Only mine will be purpler.

698
00:44:31,043 --> 00:44:32,545
Like, twice as purpler.

699
00:44:32,628 --> 00:44:34,088
The purplest!

700
00:44:34,172 --> 00:44:37,508
- Nice. Big-time thieves coming through!
- I'll race you!

701
00:44:37,592 --> 00:44:39,552
You can't beat me, old man.

702
00:44:39,635 --> 00:44:41,387
What kind of wish can do all that, Goldi?

703
00:44:41,470 --> 00:44:43,222
Oh! I can't tell ya.

704
00:44:43,306 --> 00:44:45,933
If you say what your wish is,
then it don't come true.

705
00:44:46,017 --> 00:44:47,602
Sorry, birthday wish rules.

706
00:44:47,685 --> 00:44:50,354
Oh, come on. Mother-daughter secret?

707
00:44:50,438 --> 00:44:51,981
Mama, just drop it, please.

708
00:44:52,064 --> 00:44:53,357
Oh. Okay.

709
00:44:53,441 --> 00:44:56,736
Hey, come on.
We've got some cats to catch.

710
00:45:00,948 --> 00:45:03,367
Birthday wish rules?
What's that mean?

711
00:45:03,451 --> 00:45:05,620
It means I'm not telling you my wish.

712
00:45:05,703 --> 00:45:08,372
He doesn't wanna tell us
because it's something stupid.

713
00:45:08,456 --> 00:45:10,541
Like conditioner
for that thing on his face.

714
00:45:10,625 --> 00:45:11,918
It's distinguished.

715
00:45:12,001 --> 00:45:14,587
What about you, Kitty?
What are you gonna wish for?

716
00:45:16,005 --> 00:45:18,591
Can't tell you.
Birthday wish rules or whatever.

717
00:45:18,674 --> 00:45:21,177
Ha! I bet your wish
is something stupid like...

718
00:45:24,388 --> 00:45:25,389
You're such a...

719
00:45:30,228 --> 00:45:33,356
This must be
the Pocket Full O' Posies.

720
00:45:37,235 --> 00:45:39,070
Out of the way, demon flower.

721
00:45:39,153 --> 00:45:40,988
It's pruning time!

722
00:45:47,119 --> 00:45:50,414
Aww, thank you.

723
00:45:53,376 --> 00:45:54,752
We don't have time for this.

724
00:45:54,835 --> 00:45:57,463
<i>Perro,</i> I thought your path
was supposed to be easy.

725
00:45:57,546 --> 00:46:02,718
You know, I think all you have
to do is stop and smell the roses.

726
00:46:02,802 --> 00:46:04,637
Seriously? Ugh.

727
00:46:04,720 --> 00:46:06,555
This is stupid.

728
00:46:06,639 --> 00:46:08,099
All I smell is bull...

729
00:46:08,182 --> 00:46:10,893
Shh. Watch.

730
00:46:10,977 --> 00:46:12,645
Ah!

731
00:46:14,397 --> 00:46:15,564
Don't rush through it.

732
00:46:15,648 --> 00:46:20,069
Take your time and really appreciate
what's right in front of you.

733
00:46:22,905 --> 00:46:26,409
- Ugh! His path is so corny.
<i>- Gracias.</i>

734
00:46:26,492 --> 00:46:28,327
-And cheesy.
-And lame.

735
00:46:28,411 --> 00:46:30,454
-And weird, like him.
-Yeah.

736
00:46:30,538 --> 00:46:32,540
Why are you so ridiculous, Dog?

737
00:46:32,623 --> 00:46:33,916
What's your story?

738
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:35,334
My story? Oh!

739
00:46:35,418 --> 00:46:38,504
It's actually a very funny story.

740
00:46:38,587 --> 00:46:41,507
Back when I was a pup,
me and my litter mates lived with a family.

741
00:46:41,590 --> 00:46:44,593
A family full of pranksters
who liked to play hide-and-seek,

742
00:46:44,677 --> 00:46:46,220
and I was always "it."

743
00:46:46,304 --> 00:46:48,556
Pick on the little guy, am I right?

744
00:46:48,639 --> 00:46:51,892
They tried putting me
in a packing crate, a dumpster.

745
00:46:51,976 --> 00:46:56,022
No matter how hard they tried,
I'd always find them.

746
00:46:56,105 --> 00:46:57,523
So, one day they get creative.

747
00:46:57,606 --> 00:47:01,736
And they put me in a sock
with a rock in it.

748
00:47:01,819 --> 00:47:05,197
And then throw me in a river.

749
00:47:05,281 --> 00:47:10,494
I gnawed a hole in the sock
and I swam to the surface.

750
00:47:10,578 --> 00:47:12,830
Never found them, or my litter mates.

751
00:47:12,913 --> 00:47:16,083
- So, I guess I'm still it.
- Wow.

752
00:47:16,167 --> 00:47:19,462
That is the saddest funny story
I've ever heard.

753
00:47:19,545 --> 00:47:21,422
Well, joke's on them.

754
00:47:21,505 --> 00:47:24,383
That sock they put me in, I grew into it.

755
00:47:24,467 --> 00:47:29,055
So, I got a great story
and a free sweater out of it. Win-win!

756
00:47:29,138 --> 00:47:30,765
Dude, you didn't win.

757
00:47:30,848 --> 00:47:32,808
You, of all people, should have a wish.

758
00:47:32,892 --> 00:47:35,144
I already have a comfy sweater
and two best friends.

759
00:47:35,227 --> 00:47:36,854
I got everything I could wish for.

760
00:47:36,937 --> 00:47:38,272
No magic required.

761
00:47:39,440 --> 00:47:40,691
Hmm?

762
00:47:50,993 --> 00:47:52,370
Oh! Lovely.

763
00:47:57,750 --> 00:48:00,211
Oh! We're getting really close.

764
00:48:00,294 --> 00:48:03,714
I can smell two cats, a dog... and pie?

765
00:48:05,132 --> 00:48:08,511
Well, if it isn't the idiots
who tried to steal from me.

766
00:48:08,594 --> 00:48:09,970
Hey, he remembers us.

767
00:48:10,054 --> 00:48:11,097
Behold,

768
00:48:11,180 --> 00:48:13,182
Excalibur!

769
00:48:13,265 --> 00:48:14,809
Excalibur!

770
00:48:14,892 --> 00:48:17,269
Excalibur!

771
00:48:17,353 --> 00:48:20,606
Yeah, I couldn't get this rock <i>off</i> of it,
but still pretty cool, right?

772
00:48:20,689 --> 00:48:21,941
He's gaining on us!

773
00:48:22,024 --> 00:48:23,526
Okay, little left.

774
00:48:24,110 --> 00:48:25,778
-That's it!
-Go faster.

775
00:48:25,861 --> 00:48:27,363
What, he's up me back door...

776
00:48:30,199 --> 00:48:31,534
Goldi!

777
00:48:43,087 --> 00:48:45,214
Well... start chopping!

778
00:48:45,297 --> 00:48:48,050
On it!
You don't have to tell me twice.

779
00:48:48,134 --> 00:48:51,011
I'm gonna chop the heck
out of this <i>Ficus lyrata...</i>

780
00:48:52,263 --> 00:48:53,556
Jerry, no!

781
00:48:54,974 --> 00:48:56,392
Avenge me, Jack!

782
00:48:56,475 --> 00:48:57,560
Die, die, die!

783
00:48:59,437 --> 00:49:00,604
Nope.

784
00:49:00,688 --> 00:49:03,190
Time to bring out the big guns!

785
00:49:03,274 --> 00:49:05,025
Guess I over packed.

786
00:49:05,609 --> 00:49:08,362
Magic snacks. Save those for later.

787
00:49:08,446 --> 00:49:09,905
Ah! Pay dirt!

788
00:49:11,574 --> 00:49:14,702
All right, magical locust, defoliate!

789
00:49:14,785 --> 00:49:17,955
Fly and feast! Eat those flowers!

790
00:49:18,789 --> 00:49:22,626
I'm not a magic locust.
Why, I'm not a locust at all.

791
00:49:22,710 --> 00:49:25,379
What are you then?
Some sort of demon grasshopper?

792
00:49:25,463 --> 00:49:28,549
A deadly fairy?
Put a spell on the forest then.

793
00:49:28,632 --> 00:49:30,259
I don't cast spells.

794
00:49:30,342 --> 00:49:31,427
Well, what do you do?

795
00:49:31,510 --> 00:49:33,137
Well, I-I-I judge you.

796
00:49:33,220 --> 00:49:35,014
I sit on your shoulder

797
00:49:35,097 --> 00:49:38,434
and judge your actions
and the quality of your character.

798
00:49:38,517 --> 00:49:40,060
I'm your conscience.

799
00:49:40,144 --> 00:49:41,687
I really did over pack.

800
00:49:43,147 --> 00:49:45,232
Help me, Jack! Help!

801
00:49:45,316 --> 00:49:47,067
Aren't you gonna help him, Jack?

802
00:49:47,151 --> 00:49:48,444
You're losing a lot of men.

803
00:49:48,527 --> 00:49:51,238
I'm not really stressing
about the manpower.

804
00:49:51,322 --> 00:49:54,450
I've got a bottomless bag
of magic weapons.

805
00:49:54,533 --> 00:49:56,160
These babies are gonna get me that wish

806
00:49:56,243 --> 00:49:59,288
even after the whole team
is dead and gone.

807
00:49:59,371 --> 00:50:01,165
Now, now, Jack, as your conscience, I...

808
00:50:01,248 --> 00:50:04,793
Oh, my word! It's the noble phoenix.

809
00:50:04,877 --> 00:50:08,047
She's the symbol of rebirth
and the eternal...

810
00:50:08,130 --> 00:50:10,132
Oh, God!

811
00:50:10,216 --> 00:50:13,135
Pretty boss flamethrower, right?

812
00:50:13,219 --> 00:50:16,597
I really have my work cut out for me
on this one.

813
00:50:16,680 --> 00:50:20,518
Don't be near where I'm flame-throwing.

814
00:50:27,233 --> 00:50:29,151
Do your job, demon flowers.

815
00:50:30,277 --> 00:50:31,445
Soon...

816
00:50:35,950 --> 00:50:37,618
Okay, Kitty. I think I've got it now.

817
00:50:39,328 --> 00:50:41,121
Trust me.

818
00:50:41,205 --> 00:50:43,958
Easy, easy. You're gonna
give yourself a hernia.

819
00:50:44,041 --> 00:50:45,918
Here, one more time, like this.

820
00:50:46,001 --> 00:50:47,753
Trust me.

821
00:50:48,796 --> 00:50:52,633
Ah! But of course I trust you and Puss,
even without the eyes.

822
00:50:52,716 --> 00:50:54,927
Yeah? Big mistake.

823
00:50:55,010 --> 00:50:56,554
What do you mean? You're my friends.

824
00:50:57,137 --> 00:50:58,514
You know what trust gets you?

825
00:50:58,597 --> 00:51:01,141
A sock, a rock and a swim in the river.

826
00:51:01,225 --> 00:51:03,310
You have to trust somebody, right?

827
00:51:03,394 --> 00:51:04,895
Not me. Uh-uh.

828
00:51:04,979 --> 00:51:07,856
Whenever I've let my guard down,
I've been double-crossed,

829
00:51:07,940 --> 00:51:09,942
declawed, played and betrayed.

830
00:51:11,318 --> 00:51:14,488
Never again. I am a solo act.

831
00:51:15,072 --> 00:51:18,492
I keep my secrets
and I play my cards close.

832
00:51:18,576 --> 00:51:20,411
That's how you get a winning hand.

833
00:51:20,494 --> 00:51:23,330
Take it from me. Never trust anyone.

834
00:51:27,960 --> 00:51:30,546
Wh-- Wait. That's amazing!

835
00:51:32,006 --> 00:51:33,007
You're good.

836
00:51:33,090 --> 00:51:36,010
Kitty, I've been thinking.

837
00:51:36,093 --> 00:51:37,553
Ugh. Thinking about what?

838
00:51:37,636 --> 00:51:41,223
My beautiful beard.
It is very distinguished, yes.

839
00:51:41,307 --> 00:51:45,477
But it does deprive the world
a good look at...

840
00:51:45,561 --> 00:51:46,687
the face.

841
00:51:47,396 --> 00:51:51,609
So, if it will make you happy,
I could be convinced to...

842
00:51:51,692 --> 00:51:53,152
-I've gotten used to it.
-Wait, what?

843
00:51:53,235 --> 00:51:55,112
The beard. Keep it.

844
00:51:55,195 --> 00:51:58,490
Uh... Well, you see...

845
00:51:58,574 --> 00:52:00,909
Kitty, please!
Get this itchy thing <i>off</i> of me!

846
00:52:00,993 --> 00:52:03,162
It's like a fever on my face.

847
00:52:03,245 --> 00:52:07,458
Hold on. Is the great Puss in Boots
asking for help?

848
00:52:07,541 --> 00:52:10,836
<i>Sí,</i> help. You were right.
The beard is disgusting.

849
00:52:10,919 --> 00:52:11,920
And?

850
00:52:12,004 --> 00:52:15,007
And it's like a possum crawled on my face.

851
00:52:15,090 --> 00:52:16,133
And?

852
00:52:16,216 --> 00:52:18,761
And died of shame.

853
00:52:18,844 --> 00:52:20,304
Okay, okay, possum face.

854
00:52:22,514 --> 00:52:23,932
I won't make you beg.

855
00:52:25,976 --> 00:52:27,353
Ow!

856
00:52:28,062 --> 00:52:29,605
Hey! Slow down. Ow!

857
00:52:29,688 --> 00:52:32,441
Go with the grain.
You gotta go with the grain.

858
00:52:32,524 --> 00:52:33,776
-I know what I'm doing.
-Hey!

859
00:52:33,859 --> 00:52:36,487
I'm a master of the blade. Right, <i>Perrito?</i>

860
00:52:38,364 --> 00:52:39,823
What? What? What's funny?

861
00:52:39,907 --> 00:52:42,409
Nothing should be funny.

862
00:52:49,500 --> 00:52:52,920
Ah. There's that handsome face
I remember.

863
00:52:53,003 --> 00:52:55,422
The face I haven't seen since...

864
00:52:55,506 --> 00:52:57,633
-Hey!
-...Santa Coloma.

865
00:52:57,716 --> 00:52:59,134
<i>Ah,</i> yes.

866
00:52:59,218 --> 00:53:01,637
Santa Coloma.

867
00:53:01,720 --> 00:53:02,721
You had it coming.

868
00:53:04,056 --> 00:53:07,267
Here. You can have my <i>gatito</i> blade.

869
00:53:08,811 --> 00:53:09,895
Thank you.

870
00:53:09,978 --> 00:53:11,188
Better than a stick.

871
00:53:13,982 --> 00:53:15,984
<i>Vaya con dios,</i> stick sword.

872
00:53:19,029 --> 00:53:21,865
<i>Perro!</i> What are you doing?

873
00:53:22,449 --> 00:53:24,243
<i>Perro!</i>

874
00:53:24,326 --> 00:53:25,619
Where did that crazy dog go?

875
00:53:25,703 --> 00:53:27,204
I think you like him.

876
00:53:27,287 --> 00:53:28,414
No. No, I don't.

877
00:53:28,497 --> 00:53:30,499
I think you're ready to name him.

878
00:53:30,582 --> 00:53:33,460
No! I just need his easy path
to get my wish.

879
00:53:33,544 --> 00:53:34,753
You mean my wish.

880
00:53:34,837 --> 00:53:36,714
You mean my wish.

881
00:53:38,215 --> 00:53:39,550
Sorry.

882
00:53:46,724 --> 00:53:48,142
The Baker's Dozen.

883
00:53:48,225 --> 00:53:49,226
Let him go.

884
00:53:49,309 --> 00:53:51,645
Oh, I don't know. I might keep him.

885
00:53:51,729 --> 00:53:53,689
Would you like a treat?

886
00:53:53,772 --> 00:53:55,691
Nice granny bag, Little Jack.

887
00:53:55,774 --> 00:53:59,945
It's not a granny bag!
It is a magic nanny bag.

888
00:54:00,028 --> 00:54:01,739
Now, make with the map,

889
00:54:01,822 --> 00:54:05,659
or we'll see
what the unicorn horn really does.

890
00:54:07,453 --> 00:54:10,456
You're not gonna
shoot a puppy, are you, Jack?

891
00:54:10,539 --> 00:54:11,874
Yeah. In the face. Why?

892
00:54:11,957 --> 00:54:13,959
What the...

893
00:54:14,042 --> 00:54:16,378
Give us the map,
or else the baker man gets it.

894
00:54:16,462 --> 00:54:17,463
Yeah.

895
00:54:17,546 --> 00:54:19,923
I don't even have the map,
Little Bo-Creep.

896
00:54:21,633 --> 00:54:23,218
Stop throwing my men at me!

897
00:54:24,344 --> 00:54:25,554
Come here!

898
00:54:25,637 --> 00:54:26,805
Puss in Boots has the map!

899
00:54:26,889 --> 00:54:28,599
Let's get him!

900
00:54:32,394 --> 00:54:33,729
I've got a plan.

901
00:54:33,812 --> 00:54:36,440
First one to the dog gets the wish.

902
00:54:36,523 --> 00:54:39,693
What? Oh, come on!

903
00:54:49,995 --> 00:54:51,997
Steady.

904
00:54:53,165 --> 00:54:54,958
Whoa!

905
00:54:57,169 --> 00:54:58,337
What?

906
00:55:00,130 --> 00:55:02,007
So that's what they do. Cool.

907
00:55:02,090 --> 00:55:03,258
No! Not cool!

908
00:55:03,926 --> 00:55:06,678
Aw, you shot me!

909
00:55:06,762 --> 00:55:08,180
Ah, the sight's off.

910
00:55:09,556 --> 00:55:10,891
I got him, Mr. Horner!

911
00:55:10,974 --> 00:55:11,975
My bad!

912
00:55:12,059 --> 00:55:13,185
Oh, no.

913
00:55:42,756 --> 00:55:44,466
Puss, wait!

914
00:55:45,259 --> 00:55:46,468
<i>Perro!</i>

915
00:55:46,552 --> 00:55:47,845
Thanks for the map, Softpaws.

916
00:55:57,104 --> 00:55:58,564
No, no, no!

917
00:55:58,647 --> 00:55:59,565
No!

918
00:55:59,648 --> 00:56:03,527
Oi! You've just been crimed
by The Three Bears Crime Family.

919
00:56:03,610 --> 00:56:05,904
-Yeah!
-So long, you plonkers!

920
00:56:08,615 --> 00:56:11,118
Puss, where are you?

921
00:56:21,420 --> 00:56:23,380
Puss? Puss?

922
00:56:26,174 --> 00:56:27,259
Puss!

923
00:56:32,306 --> 00:56:33,891
Puss! What's wrong?

924
00:57:07,633 --> 00:57:09,384
Thank you, <i>Perrito.</i>

925
00:57:10,052 --> 00:57:11,428
What's going on with you, Puss?

926
00:57:13,555 --> 00:57:14,932
I...

927
00:57:15,015 --> 00:57:17,893
I am down to my last life.

928
00:57:18,644 --> 00:57:19,937
And I...

929
00:57:21,438 --> 00:57:22,731
I am afraid.

930
00:57:22,814 --> 00:57:26,109
Well, it's okay to be afraid.

931
00:57:26,193 --> 00:57:28,320
No, not for Puss in Boots.

932
00:57:28,403 --> 00:57:30,948
I'm supposed to be a fearless hero.

933
00:57:31,031 --> 00:57:32,199
A legend.

934
00:57:32,741 --> 00:57:35,327
But without lives to spare,

935
00:57:35,410 --> 00:57:37,454
I am nothing.

936
00:57:38,288 --> 00:57:40,749
I need that wish to get my lives back.

937
00:57:40,832 --> 00:57:42,668
You should tell Kitty.
She would understand.

938
00:57:42,751 --> 00:57:44,962
No, no, no, she cannot hear of this.

939
00:57:45,462 --> 00:57:46,380
Okay.

940
00:57:49,216 --> 00:57:51,134
Kitty will never trust me again.

941
00:57:51,718 --> 00:57:53,303
Not after Santa Coloma.

942
00:57:53,387 --> 00:57:55,555
But that's just one bad heist.

943
00:57:55,639 --> 00:57:58,684
Santa Coloma wasn't a heist, <i>Perrito.</i>

944
00:57:58,767 --> 00:58:00,560
It was a church

945
00:58:00,644 --> 00:58:03,438
with a priest and guests.

946
00:58:03,981 --> 00:58:05,816
<i>And Kitty.</i>

947
00:58:05,899 --> 00:58:08,443
<i>Everything but me.</i>

948
00:58:09,403 --> 00:58:11,113
I ran away then too.

949
00:58:11,196 --> 00:58:12,406
Oh...

950
00:58:12,489 --> 00:58:13,699
Oh.

951
00:58:13,782 --> 00:58:15,742
Oh!

952
00:58:15,826 --> 00:58:18,245
You left her at the altar?

953
00:58:18,328 --> 00:58:19,454
It was wrong. I know.

954
00:58:20,163 --> 00:58:21,498
I am ashamed.

955
00:58:22,040 --> 00:58:24,710
I just wish I hadn't hurt her so badly.

956
00:58:25,836 --> 00:58:27,671
I regret that day.

957
00:58:28,714 --> 00:58:31,216
So, maybe you should tell that to Kitty.

958
00:58:32,009 --> 00:58:33,552
Might make you feel better.

959
00:58:34,219 --> 00:58:36,221
Might make her feel better too.

960
00:58:38,932 --> 00:58:39,933
Puss!

961
00:58:40,017 --> 00:58:41,143
Dog!

962
00:58:41,226 --> 00:58:43,812
Oh, there you are.
What happened back there?

963
00:58:43,895 --> 00:58:46,231
Kitty. I lost the map.

964
00:58:46,314 --> 00:58:47,566
I messed up.

965
00:58:47,649 --> 00:58:48,900
We'll get it back.

966
00:58:48,984 --> 00:58:50,068
We've been in worse pickles.

967
00:58:50,152 --> 00:58:51,611
Who told you that name?

968
00:58:51,695 --> 00:58:52,779
What name?

969
00:58:52,863 --> 00:58:55,032
Uh... Nothing.

970
00:58:55,115 --> 00:58:59,411
The Bears! We have to find them
before they find the star.

971
00:59:01,288 --> 00:59:03,373
Oh, we are so close.

972
00:59:03,957 --> 00:59:05,834
It's finally happening.

973
00:59:05,917 --> 00:59:07,836
I can taste that wish now.

974
00:59:07,919 --> 00:59:10,380
-And you know what it tastes like?
-Pies?

975
00:59:10,464 --> 00:59:11,798
♪ <i>Pies!♪</i>

976
00:59:11,882 --> 00:59:13,175
♪ <i>Who ate all the pies?</i> ♪

977
00:59:13,258 --> 00:59:14,843
♪ <i>Who ate all the pies?</i> ♪

978
00:59:14,926 --> 00:59:16,511
♪ <i>We did, we did, we did, we did♪</i>

979
00:59:16,595 --> 00:59:18,096
♪ <i>We ate all the pies</i> ♪

980
00:59:18,180 --> 00:59:19,890
Oh, it's gonna be wicked.

981
00:59:19,973 --> 00:59:22,059
Yeah! Imagine us.

982
00:59:22,142 --> 00:59:24,519
A big-time crime syndicate.

983
00:59:24,603 --> 00:59:27,147
Not a big-time crime syndicate, love.

984
00:59:27,230 --> 00:59:29,608
A big-time crime family.

985
00:59:29,691 --> 00:59:31,401
Isn't that right, Goldi?

986
00:59:31,485 --> 00:59:32,486
-Goldi?
-What?

987
00:59:33,820 --> 00:59:36,406
Whoa! Hey, look, the map!
It's going all fizzly.

988
00:59:36,490 --> 00:59:37,657
What did you do? Give it me.

989
00:59:37,741 --> 00:59:38,950
-Hey!
-No, no, no.

990
00:59:40,452 --> 00:59:41,661
Goldi, no biting!

991
00:59:41,745 --> 00:59:45,248
You're the smash, I'm the grab.

992
00:59:45,332 --> 00:59:46,917
I hold the map. You got it?

993
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:48,543
Okay!

994
00:59:50,128 --> 00:59:53,131
"To find your wish, adjust your view.

995
00:59:53,215 --> 00:59:56,009
What you seek
may be right in front of you."

996
00:59:56,093 --> 00:59:59,721
Well, that's a load of rubbish.
What's that supposed to mean?

997
01:00:00,347 --> 01:00:01,932
Right in front of us!

998
01:00:02,015 --> 01:00:03,850
It looks like our cabin back home.

999
01:00:03,934 --> 01:00:06,645
You really think our cabin
is in the middle of the Dark Forest?

1000
01:00:06,728 --> 01:00:09,397
Baby, give it the old sniff test.

1001
01:00:10,398 --> 01:00:11,399
Something's cooking.

1002
01:00:11,483 --> 01:00:13,443
No.

1003
01:00:13,527 --> 01:00:15,654
Do not open that door.

1004
01:00:15,737 --> 01:00:17,781
We are home! Hello, door.

1005
01:00:17,864 --> 01:00:19,199
No, don't go inside... Ugh!

1006
01:00:19,282 --> 01:00:20,867
Maybe just a quick pop in.

1007
01:00:20,951 --> 01:00:23,120
-Hello, chairs.
-What say we hibernate?

1008
01:00:23,203 --> 01:00:24,704
Hello, honey.

1009
01:00:24,788 --> 01:00:26,873
Hello, my old friend.

1010
01:00:26,957 --> 01:00:31,461
I have missed you so...

1011
01:00:31,545 --> 01:00:33,880
Look, Goldi. Porridge.

1012
01:00:33,964 --> 01:00:36,133
And it's made just the way you like it.

1013
01:00:36,216 --> 01:00:38,218
No matter how you make it,
she doesn't like it.

1014
01:00:38,301 --> 01:00:39,511
Stop it! All of you.

1015
01:00:39,594 --> 01:00:41,763
Maybe our wishes have been granted.

1016
01:00:41,847 --> 01:00:44,099
Just stop! It's not our wish granted.

1017
01:00:44,182 --> 01:00:45,934
It's an obstacle.

1018
01:00:46,017 --> 01:00:48,186
It's the forest playing tricks.

1019
01:00:48,270 --> 01:00:50,689
This isn't real. None of this is...

1020
01:01:00,532 --> 01:01:01,533
Ah!

1021
01:01:01,616 --> 01:01:03,493
That was your favorite book.

1022
01:01:03,577 --> 01:01:06,163
You used to stare at it for hours.

1023
01:01:22,262 --> 01:01:24,639
Too hard.

1024
01:01:25,182 --> 01:01:26,183
Whoop!

1025
01:01:27,309 --> 01:01:28,727
Too soft.

1026
01:01:33,815 --> 01:01:36,568
Just right.

1027
01:01:37,068 --> 01:01:39,029
Oh, this was it.

1028
01:01:39,112 --> 01:01:40,322
What was it, Mama?

1029
01:01:40,405 --> 01:01:41,948
The day a little orphan girl

1030
01:01:42,032 --> 01:01:44,993
broke into our cabin and stole our hearts.

1031
01:01:49,539 --> 01:01:52,918
The day when our world became just right.

1032
01:01:57,088 --> 01:01:58,423
How's it going?

1033
01:01:58,506 --> 01:02:00,258
Can you see anything up there?

1034
01:02:00,342 --> 01:02:02,427
Not yet, <i>Perrito..</i>.

1035
01:02:02,510 --> 01:02:03,762
You okay?

1036
01:02:03,845 --> 01:02:05,555
<i>Sí,</i> I am good.

1037
01:02:05,639 --> 01:02:06,890
So good.

1038
01:02:11,311 --> 01:02:13,355
If you wanted to hold my hand,

1039
01:02:13,438 --> 01:02:15,190
all you had to do is ask.

1040
01:02:15,273 --> 01:02:20,028
Uh... Just feel free to pull me up
whenever you get a chance.

1041
01:02:20,111 --> 01:02:25,075
Oh, I was just remembering
the last time I offered you my hand.

1042
01:02:25,158 --> 01:02:27,744
Only, that time,
I believe you had cold feet.

1043
01:02:35,168 --> 01:02:36,294
Kitty...

1044
01:02:39,673 --> 01:02:41,132
About that day,

1045
01:02:41,800 --> 01:02:44,844
Puss in Boots
is not supposed to be afraid.

1046
01:02:44,928 --> 01:02:49,015
But outside that church
in Santa Coloma...

1047
01:02:49,099 --> 01:02:53,895
...that was the first time I ever felt fear.

1048
01:02:54,562 --> 01:02:57,148
So, I ran.

1049
01:02:58,566 --> 01:03:01,403
It was a mistake, Kitty.

1050
01:03:01,486 --> 01:03:02,904
It's okay.

1051
01:03:02,988 --> 01:03:05,198
-No, no. It was cowardly.
-It's okay.

1052
01:03:05,282 --> 01:03:07,284
-You alone at the altar.
-Puss.

1053
01:03:07,367 --> 01:03:09,411
In your beautiful poofy wedding dress.

1054
01:03:09,494 --> 01:03:11,621
Puss! It's okay.

1055
01:03:12,580 --> 01:03:13,957
I didn't show up either.

1056
01:03:15,000 --> 01:03:16,001
Wait, what?

1057
01:03:16,584 --> 01:03:18,295
What do you mean, you didn't show up?

1058
01:03:18,795 --> 01:03:22,465
Well, I knew I could never compete
with your one true love.

1059
01:03:22,549 --> 01:03:24,384
-Who?
-Yourself.

1060
01:03:24,467 --> 01:03:25,552
The legend.

1061
01:03:25,635 --> 01:03:26,636
Uh.

1062
01:03:26,720 --> 01:03:28,972
I wasn't gonna show up
for that guy.

1063
01:03:29,931 --> 01:03:33,476
But you don't seem like that guy anymore.

1064
01:03:36,813 --> 01:03:39,065
Everything okay up there?

1065
01:03:39,149 --> 01:03:41,609
I'm giving you a thumbs up,
just so you know.

1066
01:03:41,693 --> 01:03:42,694
Puss.

1067
01:03:45,030 --> 01:03:46,031
Look.

1068
01:03:48,950 --> 01:03:50,118
What do you think, bug?

1069
01:03:50,201 --> 01:03:53,038
Do I wait for the cats to steal the map
and then kill them,

1070
01:03:53,121 --> 01:03:55,874
or do I just kill everybody all at once?

1071
01:03:55,957 --> 01:04:00,337
You know, I'm starting to think
you don't appreciate the value of a life.

1072
01:04:00,420 --> 01:04:03,214
What? No. I mean, I love these guys.

1073
01:04:03,298 --> 01:04:06,718
Flex the glutes. I need a solid surface.

1074
01:04:07,635 --> 01:04:10,513
There's good in all people.
There's good in all people.

1075
01:04:10,597 --> 01:04:13,391
You know, Jack,
maybe we need to dig a little deeper.

1076
01:04:13,475 --> 01:04:15,643
Tell me about your childhood.

1077
01:04:15,727 --> 01:04:17,437
Uh...

1078
01:04:17,520 --> 01:04:19,814
You know, I never had much as a kid.

1079
01:04:19,898 --> 01:04:21,316
Just loving parents

1080
01:04:21,399 --> 01:04:23,735
and stability and a mansion

1081
01:04:23,818 --> 01:04:27,405
and a thriving baked goods enterprise
for me to inherit.

1082
01:04:27,489 --> 01:04:29,199
Useless crap like that.

1083
01:04:30,408 --> 01:04:33,203
But once I get my wish,

1084
01:04:33,286 --> 01:04:37,123
I'll finally have the one thing
that will make me happy.

1085
01:04:37,957 --> 01:04:39,376
Oh, well, what's that?

1086
01:04:39,459 --> 01:04:43,046
All of the magic in the world. For me.

1087
01:04:43,129 --> 01:04:45,382
And no one else gets any.

1088
01:04:45,465 --> 01:04:46,966
Is that so much?

1089
01:04:47,050 --> 01:04:48,051
Yes!

1090
01:04:48,134 --> 01:04:50,678
Agree to disagree.
All right. Bring it over.

1091
01:04:50,762 --> 01:04:52,472
No, no! No, no, no!

1092
01:04:57,852 --> 01:04:59,229

1094

Well, you know what they say.

1095

Can't bake a pie
without losing a dozen men.

1096

Oh. Oh!

1097

Oh! Oh!

1102
01:05:21,000 --> 01:05:22,001
Ugh.

-Ready to get our wish back?
-"Our wish"?

1119
01:05:58,746 --> 01:06:01,916
Well, I've been thinking,
if you play your cards right,

1120
01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:04,586
maybe we could share the wish.

1121
01:06:06,045 --> 01:06:07,505

1122
01:06:26,399 --> 01:06:28,276
It's gone!

1123
01:06:29,027 --> 01:06:30,737

01:12:40,314 --> 01:12:41,732
Bravo!

1246
01:12:41,816 --> 01:12:42,984
One more number.

1247
01:12:43,693 --> 01:12:45,319
No, no, sorry, fellas.

1248
01:12:45,403 --> 01:12:47,071
This has been fun, eh?

1249
01:12:47,154 --> 01:12:49,448
Yeah. But could you tell me
how to get out of here?

1250
01:12:49,532 --> 01:12:51,284
I've got to get back to Dog and Kitty.

1251
01:12:52,743 --> 01:12:54,704
Whoa!
I thought you were going to get the wish.

1252
01:12:54,787 --> 01:12:56,622
You got the map. You don't need them.

1253
01:12:56,706 --> 01:12:58,541
Yeah, get those lives back.

1254
01:12:58,624 --> 01:13:00,334
Become the legend again.

1255
01:13:00,418 --> 01:13:01,919
Town to town.

1256
01:13:02,003 --> 01:13:03,421
Puss in Boots!

1257
01:13:03,504 --> 01:13:05,214
-Puss in Boots!
-Party to party.

1258
01:13:08,009 --> 01:13:10,136
Puss in Boots walks alone.

1259
01:13:14,348 --> 01:13:15,349
<i>Yeah,</i>

1260
01:13:15,433 --> 01:13:18,102
Puss in Boots walks alone.

1261
01:13:20,438 --> 01:13:24,734
Was the legend so big,
there was no room for anyone else?

1262
01:13:29,155 --> 01:13:30,990
The legend is still big, <i>gato.</i>

1263
01:13:31,073 --> 01:13:32,491
It's you that got small.

1264
01:13:32,575 --> 01:13:34,160
Yeah, you changed, man.

1265
01:13:34,243 --> 01:13:36,746
I hear he's best friends with a dog now.

1266
01:13:36,829 --> 01:13:39,540
And he doesn't even have a sword.

1267
01:13:39,624 --> 01:13:40,708
Some hero.

1268
01:13:40,791 --> 01:13:42,209
You've become a scaredy-cat.

1269
01:13:42,293 --> 01:13:44,211
We should call him Wuss in Boots.

1270
01:13:44,795 --> 01:13:46,714
No, no. No. Didn't you hear?

1271
01:13:46,797 --> 01:13:48,466
His new name is Pickles.

1272
01:13:48,549 --> 01:13:50,301
So lame.

1273
01:13:50,384 --> 01:13:52,595
Where's your litter box, Pickles?

1274
01:13:52,678 --> 01:13:54,680
You know what? You guys are jerks.

1275
01:13:54,764 --> 01:13:56,807
Which is very conflicting for me.

1276
01:13:56,891 --> 01:13:58,976
I'll find my own way out. <i>Adios!</i>

1277
01:13:59,060 --> 01:14:00,811
Oh! You think
you're better than us?

1278
01:14:00,895 --> 01:14:03,981
Without us,
you will always live a life of...

1279
01:14:04,065 --> 01:14:05,900
Fear.

1280
01:14:05,983 --> 01:14:07,068
You!

1281
01:14:07,151 --> 01:14:10,321
I do love the smell of fear.

1282
01:14:10,404 --> 01:14:13,616
- It's intoxicating.
- It is?

1283
01:14:13,699 --> 01:14:16,869
Sorry to crash the party
with your past lives,

1284
01:14:16,953 --> 01:14:19,830
or your past deaths,
as I like to call 'em.

1285
01:14:21,958 --> 01:14:25,544
I was there to witness all of them.

1286
01:14:25,628 --> 01:14:29,173
Each frivolous end.

1287
01:14:30,299 --> 01:14:33,761
But you didn't even notice me

1288
01:14:33,844 --> 01:14:39,183
because Puss in Boots laughs
in the face of death, right?

1289
01:14:41,060 --> 01:14:43,396
But you're not laughing now.

1290
01:14:45,064 --> 01:14:48,192
You are no bounty hunter. You are...

1291
01:14:48,275 --> 01:14:49,652
Death.

1292
01:14:52,822 --> 01:14:55,449
And I don't mean it metaphorically,
or rhetorically,

1293
01:14:55,533 --> 01:14:57,326
or poetically, or theoretically,

1294
01:14:57,410 --> 01:15:00,204
or in any other fancy way.

1295
01:15:00,287 --> 01:15:01,747
I'm Death,

1296
01:15:01,831 --> 01:15:03,582
straight up.

1297
01:15:03,666 --> 01:15:06,460
And I've come for you, Puss in Boots.

1298
01:15:06,544 --> 01:15:08,379
But I'm still alive.

1299
01:15:08,462 --> 01:15:10,715
You know...

1300
01:15:10,798 --> 01:15:12,341
...I'm not a cat person.

1301
01:15:12,425 --> 01:15:17,263
I find the very idea of nine lives absurd.

1302
01:15:17,346 --> 01:15:20,558
And you didn't value any of them.

1303
01:15:20,641 --> 01:15:23,436
So, why don't I do us both a favor

1304
01:15:23,519 --> 01:15:26,188
and take this last one now?

1305
01:15:26,272 --> 01:15:27,690
That's cheating!

1306
01:15:27,773 --> 01:15:29,692
Shh. Don't tell.

1307
01:15:29,775 --> 01:15:31,861
Run, Puss in Boots! Make the wish!

1308
01:15:33,029 --> 01:15:34,864
Go ahead. Run for it.

1309
01:15:34,947 --> 01:15:37,783
Makes it more fun for me.

1310
01:15:43,330 --> 01:15:45,249
<i>Run.</i>

1311
01:15:46,876 --> 01:15:49,086
<i>Run.</i>

1312
01:15:51,547 --> 01:15:52,840
<i>Run.</i>

1313
01:15:54,091 --> 01:15:55,092
<i>Run.</i>

1314
01:15:55,843 --> 01:15:58,262
<i>Run.</i>

1315
01:16:00,306 --> 01:16:01,348
Hey, Puss!

1316
01:16:01,432 --> 01:16:02,850
Run.

1317
01:16:02,933 --> 01:16:04,769
Puss! Puss, we're here.

1318
01:16:07,146 --> 01:16:10,149
Where's he going?

1319
01:16:22,870 --> 01:16:23,871
<i>Run.</i>

1320
01:16:25,790 --> 01:16:26,791
<i>Run.</i>

1321
01:17:15,172 --> 01:17:18,384
That's the third time
we've passed that same rock, Baby.

1322
01:17:18,467 --> 01:17:19,468
Oh, not again!

1323
01:17:19,552 --> 01:17:22,012
What do you want me to do?
I've lost the scent.

1324
01:17:22,096 --> 01:17:24,306
You only have one job.

1325
01:17:24,390 --> 01:17:27,560
The one thing that
makes you mildly useful is your nose,

1326
01:17:27,643 --> 01:17:30,354
- and apparently you can't even use that.
- Goldi.

1327
01:17:30,437 --> 01:17:32,940
I'm starting to think this wish
isn't what you promised us.

1328
01:17:33,023 --> 01:17:34,483
-Leave <i>off,</i> Baby.
-So what is it?

1329
01:17:34,567 --> 01:17:36,610
Eh? What's your "just right"?

1330
01:17:37,194 --> 01:17:38,445
What's so blasted important

1331
01:17:38,529 --> 01:17:40,865
that you've got us stranded
in this haunted forest?

1332
01:17:40,948 --> 01:17:44,368
I'm getting a family! That's what.
A proper family.

1333
01:17:44,994 --> 01:17:47,329
Then everything will be just right.

1334
01:17:50,541 --> 01:17:54,420
Your "just right" is getting rid of us?

1335
01:17:55,462 --> 01:17:58,674
Well, I guess some people just
stick around until the porridge is gone.

1336
01:17:58,757 --> 01:17:59,758
Eh, Goldi?

1337
01:18:03,262 --> 01:18:04,555
Come on.

1338
01:18:04,638 --> 01:18:07,141
You didn't think I would actually stay?

1339
01:18:08,184 --> 01:18:09,185
I'm not a bear.

1340
01:18:18,694 --> 01:18:21,113
I was always afraid
it was too good to last.

1341
01:18:22,448 --> 01:18:24,200
And whether you think
we're your family or not,

1342
01:18:25,075 --> 01:18:28,037
if this is something
that will make you happy,

1343
01:18:28,120 --> 01:18:29,830
we'll get you that wish.

1344
01:18:30,623 --> 01:18:31,624
Come on, boys.

1345
01:18:39,006 --> 01:18:43,135
Oh-ho-ho! What a good boy am I.

1346
01:18:52,061 --> 01:18:54,313
"Star light, star bright,

1347
01:18:54,396 --> 01:18:56,941
first star I see tonight.

1348
01:18:57,024 --> 01:18:58,025
I wish..."

1349
01:18:58,108 --> 01:18:59,902
I can't believe I fell for it again.

1350
01:18:59,985 --> 01:19:02,613
Kitty, you don't understand.

1351
01:19:02,696 --> 01:19:03,739
Don't understand what?

1352
01:19:03,822 --> 01:19:06,033
That you've been playing me
this whole time?

1353
01:19:06,116 --> 01:19:07,743
I need this wish.

1354
01:19:07,826 --> 01:19:10,412
Oh, yeah? You wanna know
what my wish was?

1355
01:19:11,330 --> 01:19:14,041
Someone, anyone I could trust.

1356
01:19:14,124 --> 01:19:15,709
Hey.

1357
01:19:15,793 --> 01:19:18,504
In my whole life, I've never had that.

1358
01:19:19,255 --> 01:19:23,217
But I thought I finally found
that someone without a wish.

1359
01:19:24,802 --> 01:19:25,928
I thought it was you.

1360
01:19:27,471 --> 01:19:29,139
But you're still running.

1361
01:19:29,223 --> 01:19:31,934
Still the same old Puss in Boots.

1362
01:19:32,017 --> 01:19:34,520
But I'm not! I'm not Puss in Boots.

1363
01:19:34,603 --> 01:19:37,773
I'm-- I am on my last life.

1364
01:19:38,732 --> 01:19:40,526
I need to get my lives back.

1365
01:19:40,609 --> 01:19:43,696
Without them, I'm not... I am not...

1366
01:19:43,779 --> 01:19:45,114
What? The legend?

1367
01:19:48,742 --> 01:19:51,328
I still can't compete
with your one true love.

1368
01:19:52,288 --> 01:19:54,373
Go on. Get your lives back...

1369
01:19:56,250 --> 01:19:58,043
Just keep them out of mine.

1370
01:20:03,007 --> 01:20:04,925
Kitty, Death is after me!

1371
01:20:05,009 --> 01:20:06,176
What?

1372
01:20:06,260 --> 01:20:08,387
I've been called a lot of things,

1373
01:20:09,013 --> 01:20:10,514
but never "Death."

1374
01:20:10,597 --> 01:20:13,100
I like it. That's my wish!

1375
01:20:13,183 --> 01:20:14,184
Oi!

1376
01:20:14,727 --> 01:20:16,687
That's Goldi's wish.

1377
01:20:52,848 --> 01:20:53,849
Grab it!

1378
01:20:55,351 --> 01:20:56,977
Move! Out of my way!

1379
01:20:57,061 --> 01:20:58,270
I've got it! I've got it!

1380
01:20:58,354 --> 01:20:59,355
Don't got it!

1381
01:21:01,190 --> 01:21:02,483
That's mine!

1382
01:21:08,864 --> 01:21:10,157
Bang, bang, bang!

1383
01:21:12,368 --> 01:21:14,411
Oh, come on! You walked into that one.

1384
01:21:16,914 --> 01:21:18,874
Mr. Horner, I need your help!

1385
01:21:18,957 --> 01:21:22,711
Duly noted, but a little busy
at the moment. Pew, pew!

1386
01:21:22,795 --> 01:21:24,380
Mr. Horner!

1387
01:21:32,846 --> 01:21:33,889
Ooh!

1388
01:21:33,972 --> 01:21:36,767
Ha-ha! It's bear season!

1389
01:21:37,935 --> 01:21:40,145
Oi! I'm gonna bust you up, plum-thumb,

1390
01:21:40,229 --> 01:21:42,064
and then I'm gonna wear your clothes!

1391
01:21:42,147 --> 01:21:43,357
That was weird.

1392
01:21:46,318 --> 01:21:47,945
No, no, no! No, no, no, no!

1393
01:21:48,028 --> 01:21:49,113
-Baby!
-Mama, help!

1394
01:21:49,196 --> 01:21:50,155
I got you!

1395
01:21:50,239 --> 01:21:51,240
-Papa!
-Son!

1396
01:21:51,323 --> 01:21:52,991
I'm coming! I got you.

1397
01:21:53,075 --> 01:21:53,909
Help!

1398
01:21:54,535 --> 01:21:56,787
-Hold on!
-Something's happening!

1399
01:21:56,870 --> 01:21:58,038
Help me!

1400
01:21:59,998 --> 01:22:01,750
No, no, no!

1401
01:22:01,834 --> 01:22:03,544
Hang on, son!

1402
01:22:03,627 --> 01:22:06,088
I can't stop it!

1403
01:22:06,171 --> 01:22:09,675
Mama, I'm slipping! I'm slipping!

1404
01:22:13,971 --> 01:22:15,681
Like I told you, Baby,

1405
01:22:15,764 --> 01:22:17,724
you're the smash, I'm the grab.

1406
01:22:17,808 --> 01:22:19,643
Yes! Yes!

1407
01:22:22,688 --> 01:22:24,273
No!

1408
01:22:29,945 --> 01:22:34,116
Hey, Softpaws.
How do you like these apples?

1409
01:22:34,199 --> 01:22:36,285
Die! Blow up already!

1410
01:22:37,161 --> 01:22:39,288
Soft paws!

1411
01:22:41,832 --> 01:22:43,292
Okay, okay, you know,

1412
01:22:43,375 --> 01:22:46,879
maybe it's time to bury the hatchet!

1413
01:22:48,297 --> 01:22:52,634
Oh, I shouldn't have telegraphed it!

1414
01:23:01,143 --> 01:23:03,145
Yeah. I don't know what to do with this.

1415
01:23:03,854 --> 01:23:06,607
But if you think you need those lives...

1416
01:23:06,690 --> 01:23:08,066
Thank you, <i>Perrito.</i>

1417
01:23:09,026 --> 01:23:11,862
You know, I've only ever had one life,

1418
01:23:11,945 --> 01:23:14,490
but sharing it with you and Kitty

1419
01:23:14,573 --> 01:23:16,700
has made it pretty special.

1420
01:23:16,783 --> 01:23:19,953
Maybe one life is enough.

1421
01:23:28,170 --> 01:23:29,046
-Huh?
-What is that?

1422
01:23:36,637 --> 01:23:37,679
Who's that?

1423
01:23:39,640 --> 01:23:41,016
He's here for me.

1424
01:23:47,523 --> 01:23:48,524
Puss!

1425
01:23:52,736 --> 01:23:54,780
I've enjoyed the chase, <i>gato.</i>

1426
01:23:55,489 --> 01:23:57,991
But I think we've reached the end now,
you and I.

1427
01:23:59,993 --> 01:24:02,538
You gonna take the coward's way out?

1428
01:24:02,621 --> 01:24:04,831
Run away to more lives?

1429
01:24:06,375 --> 01:24:07,417
Or are you gonna fight?

1430
01:24:13,090 --> 01:24:14,299
Pick it up.

1431
01:24:15,968 --> 01:24:17,511
Go on. Pick it up.

1432
01:24:35,279 --> 01:24:36,530
What's the matter?

1433
01:24:36,613 --> 01:24:39,199
Lives flashing before your eyes?

1434
01:24:39,783 --> 01:24:42,035
No. Just one.

1435
01:24:43,120 --> 01:24:44,204
I'm done running.

1436
01:24:49,042 --> 01:24:51,253
Fear me, if you dare.

1437
01:24:52,337 --> 01:24:54,798
This is gonna be fun.

1438
01:25:04,891 --> 01:25:06,184
Yah!

1439
01:25:14,818 --> 01:25:17,821
<i>Bien. Muy bien.</i>

1440
01:25:35,213 --> 01:25:38,675
You really gotta stop losing that.

1441
01:25:52,689 --> 01:25:55,150
Say hello to my <i>gatito</i> blade.

1442
01:26:00,197 --> 01:26:01,198
Come on!

1443
01:26:02,491 --> 01:26:03,784
Huh?

1444
01:26:21,510 --> 01:26:22,636
Pick it up.

1445
01:26:25,305 --> 01:26:27,599
I know I can never defeat you, <i>lobo,</i>

1446
01:26:27,683 --> 01:26:30,519
but I will never stop fighting
for this life.

1447
01:26:56,420 --> 01:26:58,296
You're ruining this for me.

1448
01:26:58,380 --> 01:27:01,842
I came here for an arrogant, little legend

1449
01:27:01,925 --> 01:27:04,010
who thought he was immortal.

1450
01:27:06,221 --> 01:27:08,473
But I don't see him anymore.

1451
01:27:12,811 --> 01:27:16,356
Live your life, Puss in Boots.
Live it well.

1452
01:27:20,193 --> 01:27:23,113
You know we will meet again, right?

1453
01:27:38,962 --> 01:27:41,673
You know, when you
said Death was after you,

1454
01:27:41,757 --> 01:27:44,342
I thought you were
just being melodramatic.

1455
01:27:45,635 --> 01:27:46,720
The wish is yours.

1456
01:27:47,596 --> 01:27:49,765
You deserve someone you can trust.

1457
01:27:55,061 --> 01:27:57,898
I don't need it.
I've got what I wished for.

1458
01:27:57,981 --> 01:27:59,566
No magic required.

1459
01:28:10,327 --> 01:28:13,371
<i>Ah.</i> Magic snacks.

1460
01:28:18,585 --> 01:28:21,213
Holy <i>frijoles.</i>

1461
01:28:21,296 --> 01:28:23,840
I was worried for a second
I would come out naked,

1462
01:28:23,924 --> 01:28:26,468
but my clothes grew too! Cool.

1463
01:28:27,219 --> 01:28:28,720
Thank you.

1464
01:28:30,889 --> 01:28:32,307
Gotcha!

1465
01:28:32,390 --> 01:28:34,226
The last wish.

1466
01:28:34,726 --> 01:28:36,686
It's mine!

1467
01:28:37,521 --> 01:28:38,855
"Star light,

1468
01:28:38,939 --> 01:28:39,981
star bright,

1469
01:28:40,065 --> 01:28:42,818
first star I see tonight.

1470
01:28:42,901 --> 01:28:43,777
<i>Perrito!</i>

1471
01:28:43,860 --> 01:28:47,113
I wish I may, I wish I might

1472
01:28:47,197 --> 01:28:49,115
- have this wish..."
- Señor Horner!

1473
01:28:50,033 --> 01:28:52,786
Please don't make that wish. Please.

1474
01:28:54,037 --> 01:28:55,413
Please.

1475
01:28:55,497 --> 01:28:56,540
What are you doing?

1476
01:28:56,623 --> 01:28:58,834
Please.

1477
01:28:58,917 --> 01:29:00,836
Seriously, are you having a hernia
or something?

1478
01:29:00,919 --> 01:29:04,631
Pretty... please.

1479
01:29:07,050 --> 01:29:09,886
They're such pools of vulnerability.

1480
01:29:11,805 --> 01:29:14,140
It's so cute

1481
01:29:14,224 --> 01:29:16,309
how you think that would work on me.

1482
01:29:16,393 --> 01:29:18,270
Don't you know I'm dead inside?

1483
01:29:18,353 --> 01:29:20,063
By the way, your nose is bleeding.

1484
01:29:20,146 --> 01:29:21,314
Oh.

1485
01:29:21,398 --> 01:29:25,235
I was just buying some time
for Team Friendship.

1486
01:29:26,903 --> 01:29:28,154
Team what?

1487
01:29:37,038 --> 01:29:39,040
Spanish Splinter!

1488
01:29:39,124 --> 01:29:40,584
Ow!

1489
01:29:44,588 --> 01:29:46,006
Hey!

1490
01:29:50,552 --> 01:29:52,178
What have you done?

1491
01:29:52,762 --> 01:29:53,805
No!

1492
01:29:53,889 --> 01:29:55,640
The map. My wish.

1493
01:29:55,724 --> 01:29:56,683
Go, go, go!

1494
01:30:01,187 --> 01:30:04,941
It's mine. Huh?

1495
01:30:05,025 --> 01:30:07,402
You looking for something?

1496
01:30:07,485 --> 01:30:09,946
Consider this my resignation, mister.

1497
01:30:13,074 --> 01:30:13,909
Wha--

1498
01:30:14,868 --> 01:30:17,579
What did I do to deserve this?

1499
01:30:18,246 --> 01:30:22,792
I mean, what specifically?

1500
01:30:32,177 --> 01:30:33,178
Gorgeous.

1501
01:30:35,180 --> 01:30:39,100
I hate to say it,
but should we make a wish?

1502
01:30:39,184 --> 01:30:42,938
Kitty, one life spent with you

1503
01:30:43,021 --> 01:30:45,023
is all that I could wish for.

1504
01:30:55,784 --> 01:30:57,702
You saved my life, sis.

1505
01:30:58,286 --> 01:31:00,330
You was gonna make the wish
but you didn't make the wish

1506
01:31:00,413 --> 01:31:01,998
'cause you wanted to save your family...

1507
01:31:02,082 --> 01:31:03,917
...and I was really scared. And then...

1508
01:31:04,000 --> 01:31:06,628
Oi, don't get so blubbery about it.

1509
01:31:06,711 --> 01:31:08,672
Whose porridge would I eat otherwise?

1510
01:31:08,755 --> 01:31:11,383
I'm sorry you didn't get your wish,
Goldi-love.

1511
01:31:11,466 --> 01:31:13,969
But I did, Mama. I did get my wish.

1512
01:31:14,469 --> 01:31:16,096
Everything

1513
01:31:16,596 --> 01:31:18,223
is just right.

1514
01:31:19,808 --> 01:31:21,977
Oh! Now you've made me cry.

1515
01:31:22,060 --> 01:31:23,520
Oh!

1516
01:31:23,603 --> 01:31:26,314
Now, what say we all go home
and hibernate?

1517
01:31:26,398 --> 01:31:28,984
Goldi, you are a chip <i>off</i> the old block,
you are.

1518
01:31:29,067 --> 01:31:30,568
Well, what can I say?

1519
01:31:31,695 --> 01:31:33,405
I won the orphan lottery.

1520
01:31:34,572 --> 01:31:36,241
Softpaws. Boots.

1521
01:31:36,324 --> 01:31:37,784
-Goldi.
-Bears.

1522
01:31:37,867 --> 01:31:40,870
Hey, Baby,
you got any ideas for our next job?

1523
01:31:40,954 --> 01:31:42,747
Oh! Remember that pie factory?

1524
01:31:42,831 --> 01:31:46,584
I suspect that they might be experiencing
a leadership vacuum.

1525
01:31:46,668 --> 01:31:49,671
Oh, family business!
Oh, how exciting!

1526
01:31:49,754 --> 01:31:53,466
Now's a good time
to talk about ethical business practices.

1527
01:31:54,509 --> 01:31:57,512
There's a talking cockroach on my nose.
Get it off! Get it off!

1528
01:31:57,595 --> 01:31:58,888
Hold still.

1529
01:31:58,972 --> 01:32:00,056
Wait just a second.

1530
01:32:00,140 --> 01:32:01,933
Hey! Hang on!

1531
01:32:02,017 --> 01:32:05,395
Hey, <i>Perrito.</i> About that name.
Let's pick one out for you.

1532
01:32:05,478 --> 01:32:08,606
- Yeah. Oh, what about Chiquito?
- Mmm...

1533
01:32:08,690 --> 01:32:11,985
Chomper! What do you think, <i>Perrito?</i>
Chomper, no?

1534
01:32:12,068 --> 01:32:15,447
I got it, I got it. How about Jeff?

1535
01:32:15,530 --> 01:32:16,573
-Jeff?
-Yeah.

1536
01:32:16,656 --> 01:32:18,158
He doesn't have a Jeffs face.

1537
01:32:19,367 --> 01:32:23,246
You know, if it's the same to you,
I think I'll just stick with Perrito.

1538
01:32:23,329 --> 01:32:26,708
I kinda like it,
since that's what my friends call me.

1539
01:32:26,791 --> 01:32:28,877
Then Perrito it shall be.

1540
01:32:31,004 --> 01:32:33,339
You know, to be honest,
Chomper is pretty good.

1541
01:32:33,423 --> 01:32:34,632
Yeah, but no.

1542
01:32:34,716 --> 01:32:37,761
Well, we'll keep work shopping it.

1543
01:32:50,315 --> 01:32:53,401
I want this vacation to be perfect!

1544
01:32:53,485 --> 01:32:55,695
Did you remember to pack my captain's hat?

1545
01:32:55,779 --> 01:32:58,740
Yes, Governor. And your captain's shoes,
your captain's coat

1546
01:32:58,823 --> 01:33:00,241
and your captain's pajamas.

1547
01:33:00,325 --> 01:33:03,953
And what about... My boat!

1548
01:33:04,037 --> 01:33:05,830
Puss in Boots!

1549
01:33:12,170 --> 01:33:13,254
<i>Perrito.</i>

1550
01:33:13,338 --> 01:33:16,174
Team Friendship?
We did not agree to this.

1551
01:33:16,257 --> 01:33:18,635
Yeah, it makes us look ridiculous.

1552
01:33:18,718 --> 01:33:20,178
Too late now. It's official.

1553
01:33:20,261 --> 01:33:21,888
Seagull!

1554
01:33:23,681 --> 01:33:26,267
Steady as she goes, Perrito.

1555
01:33:26,851 --> 01:33:27,894
Dokey doke.

1556
01:33:27,977 --> 01:33:29,312
