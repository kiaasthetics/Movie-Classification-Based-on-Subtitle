00:00:36,245 --> 00:00:38,747
<i>Long ago
in a faraway place...</i>

3
00:00:40,615 --> 00:00:44,753
<i>the beautiful island of Goola
began sinking into the sea.</i>

4
00:00:50,259 --> 00:00:53,029
<i>All the creatures of Goola
lived in helpless fear</i>

5
00:00:53,162 --> 00:00:55,664
<i>of the day when their island
home would vanish</i>

6
00:00:55,797 --> 00:00:57,133
<i>under the waves.</i>

7
00:00:58,633 --> 00:01:01,137
- <i>Ah, not yet.</i>
- Oh, boy.

8
00:01:03,973 --> 00:01:06,242
<i>But they knew
it would happen one day.</i>

9
00:01:07,977 --> 00:01:09,744
- <i>Ah... no.</i>
- Oh, yeah.

10
00:01:13,815 --> 00:01:17,353
<i>Until an especially clever
monkey named Moneke</i>

11
00:01:17,485 --> 00:01:19,788
<i>had a very big idea.</i>

12
00:01:22,857 --> 00:01:25,394
<i>He would build
a great machine to harness</i>

13
00:01:25,527 --> 00:01:28,164
<i>the power of the volcano
and all the fruit of Goola,</i>

14
00:01:28,297 --> 00:01:32,600
<i>and create a concoction that
would keep the island afloat.</i>

15
00:01:34,502 --> 00:01:36,072
<i>When it was finished...</i>

16
00:02:06,435 --> 00:02:08,404
<i>The machine worked better
than anyone</i>

17
00:02:08,536 --> 00:02:10,072
<i>could have ever dreamed.</i>

18
00:02:17,512 --> 00:02:21,317
<i>And there Goola remained for
generation after generation,</i>

19
00:02:21,450 --> 00:02:23,685
<i>safely above the water.</i>

20
00:02:24,286 --> 00:02:26,055
<i>Until one day...</i>

21
00:02:27,722 --> 00:02:31,260
<i>Moneke's amazing machine
began to fail.</i>

22
00:02:41,836 --> 00:02:43,605
Watch the pressure!

23
00:02:46,342 --> 00:02:48,210
You! Get on that valve.

24
00:02:48,344 --> 00:02:49,912
Yes, sir.

25
00:02:53,581 --> 00:02:56,085
Ooh, out of my way!

26
00:03:13,701 --> 00:03:15,137
Ooh!

27
00:03:21,310 --> 00:03:24,947
Cheek, buddy.
No need to crash the party.

28
00:03:26,248 --> 00:03:28,517
You might try being
a little lighter on your feet.

29
00:03:28,650 --> 00:03:29,784
Oops.

30
00:03:29,919 --> 00:03:32,021
Be still my beating heart.

31
00:03:32,154 --> 00:03:36,591
What's all that noise, anyway?

32
00:03:36,724 --> 00:03:39,128
Yeah, that's it.

33
00:03:40,896 --> 00:03:42,465
You mind turning it down?

34
00:03:44,033 --> 00:03:47,269
Whoa, there,
take a number, big boy.

35
00:03:47,403 --> 00:03:49,004
There's plenty of me
to go around.

36
00:03:49,138 --> 00:03:51,040
The old ape wants to see you.

37
00:03:51,173 --> 00:03:53,442
The executive summons.
Well, what do you know?

38
00:03:53,576 --> 00:03:55,010
I must have done
something right.

39
00:03:55,144 --> 00:03:58,948
Duty calls, girls.

40
00:03:59,081 --> 00:04:00,883
Always leave them
wanting more,

41
00:04:01,016 --> 00:04:03,285
that's my motto.
I can see it's yours, too.

42
00:04:06,222 --> 00:04:07,789
Somebody should do
something about that.

43
00:04:11,894 --> 00:04:13,596
What do you know?
This used to be the way

44
00:04:13,728 --> 00:04:15,064
to my uncle's office.

45
00:04:15,197 --> 00:04:16,999
I guess we'll just have
to turn around.

46
00:04:23,305 --> 00:04:26,774
- Out of the way, pork chop.
- Oh, ah!

47
00:04:27,476 --> 00:04:29,545
Huh?

48
00:04:29,677 --> 00:04:32,348
Now, that's what
I call cheek to cheek.

49
00:04:32,481 --> 00:04:36,085
Oh, pardon,
oh, excuse me. Sorry, sir.

50
00:04:36,851 --> 00:04:39,522
Don't mention it.
And keep up the good work.

51
00:04:40,089 --> 00:04:42,358
Say, don't I know you?

52
00:04:44,126 --> 00:04:48,364
I could fire you, ham hocks,
but if this island sinks,

53
00:04:48,497 --> 00:04:49,797
we might need an extra float.

54
00:04:49,932 --> 00:04:52,834
- Ha! You think?
- Ah, don't listen to him!

55
00:04:52,968 --> 00:04:57,006
I happen to like a fellow
who enjoys life... a lot.

56
00:04:58,440 --> 00:05:00,142
For luck.

57
00:05:06,482 --> 00:05:09,652
Hey, Sal, baby.
Long time, no see.

58
00:05:12,254 --> 00:05:14,689
Piece of advice:
you need to learn who really

59
00:05:14,822 --> 00:05:18,360
runs this company, and start
spreading the sugar around,

60
00:05:18,494 --> 00:05:19,929
if you know what I mean.

61
00:05:20,462 --> 00:05:21,931
Oh!

62
00:05:22,830 --> 00:05:24,266
Ah, Peanut.

63
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:26,335
Uncle Moneke!

64
00:05:28,637 --> 00:05:30,039
There you are.

65
00:05:30,172 --> 00:05:32,408
How did you know
I was coming to see you today?

66
00:05:32,541 --> 00:05:33,943
Were you?

67
00:05:34,076 --> 00:05:35,411
Well, it's downright eerie
when that happens.

68
00:05:35,544 --> 00:05:36,679
Like a sixth sense.

69
00:05:36,811 --> 00:05:38,347
Must be that family connection.

70
00:05:39,281 --> 00:05:41,450
Over here.
That's better.

71
00:05:41,584 --> 00:05:43,219
Now, what can I do for you?

72
00:05:43,352 --> 00:05:46,821
Peanut, I'd like you to meet
an honored citizen of Goola.

73
00:05:47,990 --> 00:05:49,724
Pink was one of the builders

74
00:05:49,857 --> 00:05:51,793
of the original
Goola Juice processors.

75
00:05:51,927 --> 00:05:55,164
Great Goola!
That makes you...

76
00:05:57,900 --> 00:06:00,202
A humble servant of Goola.

77
00:06:00,336 --> 00:06:03,472
Pink is one
of our family's oldest friends.

78
00:06:03,606 --> 00:06:04,739
Sure is.

79
00:06:04,872 --> 00:06:06,942
Pleasure to meet you.

80
00:06:07,076 --> 00:06:09,478
With a name like that,
school must have been rough.

81
00:06:09,612 --> 00:06:12,248
Not for me.

82
00:06:12,381 --> 00:06:14,483
There's no one
sharper than Pink.

83
00:06:14,617 --> 00:06:15,951
You don't say.

84
00:06:16,085 --> 00:06:17,886
I asked him
to come out of retirement

85
00:06:18,020 --> 00:06:19,421
from the other side
of the island

86
00:06:19,555 --> 00:06:21,290
to give us his perspective.

87
00:06:21,423 --> 00:06:24,093
I'm worried about the recent
breakdown of the machines.

88
00:06:24,226 --> 00:06:26,895
We're working on it, sir,
day and night.

89
00:06:27,029 --> 00:06:29,198
Of course you are, Cheek.

90
00:06:29,331 --> 00:06:31,267
But we can use
all the help we can get.

91
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:34,570
He's right. There's anything
I've learned from my uncle,

92
00:06:34,703 --> 00:06:36,939
it's that machines break down
and we repair them,

93
00:06:37,072 --> 00:06:39,975
whatever it takes.
This time is no different.

94
00:06:40,109 --> 00:06:43,712
"We?" When was the last time
you got your hands dirty?

95
00:06:43,845 --> 00:06:45,147
I don't know.

96
00:06:45,281 --> 00:06:47,216
When was the last time
we shook hands?

97
00:06:49,184 --> 00:06:52,820
Now, boys,
it's time we faced facts.

98
00:06:52,955 --> 00:06:55,324
If we don't fix
the problem soon.

99
00:06:55,457 --> 00:06:58,761
What went up
is going to splash down.

100
00:06:58,927 --> 00:07:01,330
That's why I ordered
an investigation

101
00:07:01,463 --> 00:07:04,166
into the frequency
of incidents and malfunctions.

102
00:07:04,300 --> 00:07:06,702
If it involves
getting our hands dirty,

103
00:07:06,834 --> 00:07:08,270
don't we have apes who do that?

104
00:07:08,404 --> 00:07:10,906
Getting your hands
a little dirty now, Peanut,

105
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:13,108
is good preparation for later.

106
00:07:13,242 --> 00:07:16,512
All this, my boy,
will be yours.

107
00:07:19,348 --> 00:07:21,450
Here's my lead
investigator now.

108
00:07:21,583 --> 00:07:23,851
Everyone, this is Flo.

109
00:07:23,986 --> 00:07:25,454
Good morning.

110
00:07:25,587 --> 00:07:27,890
Very, very clever.

111
00:07:28,023 --> 00:07:30,192
You did it without telling me?

112
00:07:30,326 --> 00:07:33,362
It was important
to get a fresh perspective.

113
00:07:33,495 --> 00:07:37,299
Flo, if you'd care to share
your findings with everyone?

114
00:07:37,433 --> 00:07:39,867
Thank you. Gentlemen,
the data clearly shows that

115
00:07:40,002 --> 00:07:43,138
in recent months, the frequency
of incidents and malfunctions

116
00:07:43,272 --> 00:07:46,375
has dramatically gone up,
while the island has gone down.

117
00:07:47,209 --> 00:07:49,611
We're falling faster
than a ripe grapefruit.

118
00:07:50,879 --> 00:07:53,182
Looking closer, key indicators
suggest that there

119
00:07:53,315 --> 00:07:55,084
is a pattern at work.

120
00:08:00,923 --> 00:08:04,360
Hmm. Uh-huh. Ah!

121
00:08:12,634 --> 00:08:14,937
Big, round, hungry?

122
00:08:15,070 --> 00:08:16,905
You want a sandwich? No.

123
00:08:17,406 --> 00:08:20,743
Big problem.
One point for me.

124
00:08:20,876 --> 00:08:22,211
Next word. It's fun.

125
00:08:22,344 --> 00:08:26,014
Pointy... pineapple? Rock?

126
00:08:27,182 --> 00:08:29,017
Your pet rock
is a pointy pineapple?

127
00:08:29,952 --> 00:08:32,454
Nah. Back to problem.

128
00:08:32,588 --> 00:08:34,656
Swimming? Boogie?
What are you doing?

129
00:08:34,790 --> 00:08:36,925
Moving. Parts.
Machine.

130
00:08:37,059 --> 00:08:41,663
Ah! Ha-ha. Problem. Machine.

131
00:08:42,131 --> 00:08:44,233
Problem machine! I got it!

132
00:08:44,366 --> 00:08:48,036
The machines
all have one problem.

133
00:08:48,170 --> 00:08:50,739
- Why, yes. That's right.
- Huh?

134
00:08:50,873 --> 00:08:53,075
We should be able
to trace all of the incidents

135
00:08:53,208 --> 00:08:54,943
back to one central problem.

136
00:08:55,077 --> 00:08:57,045
I'm glad you see it, too.

137
00:08:57,846 --> 00:09:00,482
Oh, actually, it was...

138
00:09:03,318 --> 00:09:08,090
obvious, in a not-so-obvious
sort of way,

139
00:09:08,223 --> 00:09:10,058
if you see what I mean.

140
00:09:10,192 --> 00:09:12,194
Why, yes, I do.

141
00:09:12,327 --> 00:09:14,630
Now we just have
to find the problem.

142
00:09:14,763 --> 00:09:15,998
Excellent, Peanut.

143
00:09:16,131 --> 00:09:17,366
Now, hold the fruit.

144
00:09:17,499 --> 00:09:19,201
If there was a central problem,

145
00:09:19,334 --> 00:09:21,570
I would have found it.

146
00:09:21,703 --> 00:09:23,872
Pink, what do you say?

147
00:09:24,373 --> 00:09:27,476
Hmm.
I'm with the big one on this.

148
00:09:27,609 --> 00:09:29,678
I don't see it.

149
00:09:29,812 --> 00:09:32,214
But how can you say
that when it's so...

150
00:09:32,347 --> 00:09:34,249
- Obvious?
- But what about the tremors?

151
00:09:34,383 --> 00:09:37,586
It's been quiet
on my side of the island.

152
00:09:37,719 --> 00:09:39,354
The increased
volcanic activity?

153
00:09:39,488 --> 00:09:43,325
Volcanoes are known
to bubble and boil.

154
00:09:43,459 --> 00:09:45,461
And the fact that Goola
is losing altitude.

155
00:09:45,594 --> 00:09:48,797
Ah, the excitability of youth.

156
00:09:48,932 --> 00:09:52,134
Then again, I can't see much
of anything these days.

157
00:09:52,267 --> 00:09:53,869
My dear Moneke.

158
00:09:54,002 --> 00:09:58,908
It appears that I have nothing
useful to contribute here.

159
00:09:59,041 --> 00:10:02,077
I'm afraid my time has passed.

160
00:10:02,211 --> 00:10:04,881
As mine soon
will be, too, old friend.

161
00:10:05,013 --> 00:10:06,148
Don't say that!

162
00:10:06,281 --> 00:10:09,084
Yeah, we'd be lost without you.

163
00:10:09,218 --> 00:10:11,119
Sooner than you think.

164
00:10:12,956 --> 00:10:15,324
I'll take my leave now.

165
00:10:15,991 --> 00:10:17,659
Thank you for your service.

166
00:10:19,528 --> 00:10:20,629
Stay sharp.

167
00:10:20,762 --> 00:10:23,065
Now, some of us
can get back to work.

168
00:10:23,198 --> 00:10:24,934
Not so fast!

169
00:10:25,067 --> 00:10:27,302
Boys, at a time like this,

170
00:10:27,436 --> 00:10:29,104
we have to put aside
our differences

171
00:10:29,238 --> 00:10:31,607
- and work together.
- Don't we always?

172
00:10:31,740 --> 00:10:34,978
I'm glad you agree, because Flo
and I have come up with a plan

173
00:10:35,110 --> 00:10:37,679
to deal with our dilemma.

174
00:10:43,452 --> 00:10:45,354
Not since
the days of Moneke I

175
00:10:45,487 --> 00:10:48,892
has such
a noble task been undertaken.

176
00:10:49,024 --> 00:10:50,459
Look at that.

177
00:10:51,827 --> 00:10:53,729
Just a little warm.

178
00:10:54,329 --> 00:10:57,332
Somewhere out there,
something is causing

179
00:10:57,466 --> 00:10:59,067
our great Goola to sink,

180
00:10:59,201 --> 00:11:03,805
and this expedition
must find what it is,

181
00:11:03,940 --> 00:11:07,242
or we are lost.

182
00:11:07,911 --> 00:11:09,645
- Yes, Peanut.
- Uh...

183
00:11:10,178 --> 00:11:12,814
If the problem's
somewhere out there,

184
00:11:12,949 --> 00:11:15,384
what are we doing up here?

185
00:11:15,517 --> 00:11:16,785
Ah...

186
00:11:18,253 --> 00:11:20,924
I salute you and I bid you all

187
00:11:21,056 --> 00:11:22,491
fruit speed.

188
00:11:33,435 --> 00:11:35,137
You mean we're going in there?

189
00:11:35,270 --> 00:11:37,205
It's the fastest way
to get around the island.

190
00:11:37,339 --> 00:11:39,074
Not to mention an early grave.

191
00:11:39,207 --> 00:11:41,276
Oh, it's not that dangerous.

192
00:11:41,410 --> 00:11:43,211
Almost all of our first
volunteers have come back.

193
00:11:43,345 --> 00:11:44,881
That's almost reassuring.

194
00:11:47,215 --> 00:11:48,918
What is so funny?

195
00:11:49,685 --> 00:11:52,688
Uncle Moneke, I was thinking.

196
00:11:54,991 --> 00:11:56,224
You were saying?

197
00:11:56,358 --> 00:11:58,627
What this team
really needs is a...

198
00:11:59,695 --> 00:12:00,829
coordinator.

199
00:12:00,964 --> 00:12:02,731
- A coordinator?
- Exactly.

200
00:12:02,864 --> 00:12:06,868
Someone to remain behind
in case of emergencies.

201
00:12:08,270 --> 00:12:09,906
And since I'm an expert

202
00:12:10,039 --> 00:12:11,607
at reading messenger mugs,

203
00:12:11,740 --> 00:12:14,978
I'll be able to send supplies
or help when it's needed.

204
00:12:15,611 --> 00:12:17,880
There will be no help, Peanut.

205
00:12:18,014 --> 00:12:19,748
No help?

206
00:12:19,882 --> 00:12:22,651
No one must ever know
about this.

207
00:12:22,784 --> 00:12:25,621
The citizens of Goola will
panic just like before

208
00:12:25,754 --> 00:12:28,190
if they really knew
how bad things are.

209
00:12:28,323 --> 00:12:31,126
- Very, very, very sensible.
- Glad you agree.

210
00:12:31,259 --> 00:12:33,228
I'm a sensible fella.

211
00:12:34,162 --> 00:12:35,631
Don't miss your bubble.

212
00:12:48,176 --> 00:12:49,879
Hey, buddy.

213
00:12:50,013 --> 00:12:51,881
Thanks for that tip back there,
you made me look great.

214
00:12:52,015 --> 00:12:54,083
- Anything to help, sir.
- You mean that?

215
00:12:54,216 --> 00:12:55,350
Sure, I do.

216
00:12:55,484 --> 00:12:56,953
You're all going to be heroes.

217
00:12:57,086 --> 00:12:59,588
In that case, throw
that wrench in the machine.

218
00:12:59,721 --> 00:13:01,090
- Throw the wrench?
- Do it!

219
00:13:01,223 --> 00:13:02,959
- In the machine?
- Go on.

220
00:13:03,092 --> 00:13:04,593
- That's sabotage.
- That's an order.

221
00:13:04,961 --> 00:13:07,729
Uh-uh!

222
00:13:07,863 --> 00:13:10,365
You really had me going, sir,
that's a funny one.

223
00:13:10,499 --> 00:13:11,833
- Give me the wrench.
- Peanut!

224
00:13:11,968 --> 00:13:14,202
- What's the matter?
- I don't do bubbles.

225
00:13:14,336 --> 00:13:16,605
Unless they're tiny
and in champagne.

226
00:13:16,738 --> 00:13:20,308
Let's face it, I'm just not
the monkey for this mission.

227
00:13:20,442 --> 00:13:22,344
Normally I'd agree with you.

228
00:13:22,477 --> 00:13:23,845
You should always trust
your better judgment.

229
00:13:23,980 --> 00:13:25,148
But I would be wrong.

230
00:13:25,280 --> 00:13:26,415
Now, now, no, don't doubt

231
00:13:26,548 --> 00:13:28,250
yourself like that.

232
00:13:28,383 --> 00:13:30,519
Today, you showed me
that you truly understand

233
00:13:30,652 --> 00:13:32,354
the complexities
of our problem.

234
00:13:32,487 --> 00:13:34,623
Even Cheek couldn't see it.

235
00:13:34,756 --> 00:13:35,992
Oh, that.

236
00:13:36,125 --> 00:13:37,559
I've never been more proud.

237
00:13:37,693 --> 00:13:39,996
Gee, what can I say?

238
00:13:40,129 --> 00:13:43,198
I need you on this mission.

239
00:13:43,331 --> 00:13:44,800
When you put it that way...

240
00:13:44,934 --> 00:13:46,468
Hey, slow down there.

241
00:13:46,601 --> 00:13:48,037
What are you...
Hey, what are you, huh?

242
00:13:48,171 --> 00:13:49,538
I thought we were friends here.

243
00:13:49,671 --> 00:13:51,573
I wish I could trade places
with you, sir.

244
00:13:51,707 --> 00:13:54,309
Well, your wish is my command!

245
00:13:55,477 --> 00:13:56,611
Wait a minute.

246
00:13:56,745 --> 00:13:58,981
- That was fun!
- Bye-bye.

247
00:14:00,116 --> 00:14:02,451
Ah! Aw, too tight.

248
00:14:02,584 --> 00:14:05,988
- Oh, that's better.
- Oh, great mother of Goola.

249
00:14:06,122 --> 00:14:07,289
What did you eat for lunch?

250
00:14:07,422 --> 00:14:09,458
- Flipping!
- No, no, no, no, no.

251
00:14:09,591 --> 00:14:11,426
I don't want to know.

252
00:14:13,029 --> 00:14:14,163
Toodle-oo.

253
00:14:14,296 --> 00:14:15,497
Have a safe trip.

254
00:14:15,630 --> 00:14:17,432
There go my frequent
flyer miles.

255
00:14:18,233 --> 00:14:19,868
Oh, oh!

256
00:14:20,402 --> 00:14:22,404
I'm feeling a little upset
in the tummy.

257
00:14:24,740 --> 00:14:26,943
No, I got it under control.
I'm fine now, thanks.

258
00:14:36,919 --> 00:14:39,588
Ah! Oh, fruit.

259
00:14:39,721 --> 00:14:44,127
Hey, boy, you know,
this isn't so bad, after all!

260
00:14:54,070 --> 00:14:57,305
This is so cool!

261
00:14:57,439 --> 00:14:58,673
We're going outside the city!

262
00:14:58,807 --> 00:15:00,243
Didn't anybody ever tell you

263
00:15:00,375 --> 00:15:01,510
it's dangerous
outside the city?

264
00:15:01,643 --> 00:15:02,979
Ah, at least we're in here?

265
00:15:03,112 --> 00:15:05,747
Sure. Safely inside
a giant speeding bubble.

266
00:15:05,882 --> 00:15:08,450
- I feel better already.
- Hey, look!

267
00:15:10,086 --> 00:15:12,287
At least there'll be
witnesses when this thing pops.

268
00:15:12,420 --> 00:15:15,958
Hey, hey.
What's he doing?

269
00:15:16,092 --> 00:15:18,560
Maybe she has something
in her eye.

270
00:15:18,693 --> 00:15:20,495
In a pig's eye, she does.

271
00:15:20,629 --> 00:15:22,497
Come on, we've got
to get this thing over there.

272
00:15:22,631 --> 00:15:25,201
- How?
- There!

273
00:15:25,333 --> 00:15:27,702
There, lean into it.

274
00:15:32,407 --> 00:15:34,409
That cheeky monkey.

275
00:15:34,543 --> 00:15:36,378
- Now what?
- Left!

276
00:15:36,511 --> 00:15:39,048
Lean left.
Right. Right.

277
00:15:39,182 --> 00:15:40,615
Left.

278
00:15:41,583 --> 00:15:43,552
Now we're moving.

279
00:15:45,520 --> 00:15:47,355
Aha! We meet again.

280
00:15:47,489 --> 00:15:49,858
This is it.
Get ready.

281
00:15:49,992 --> 00:15:51,160
Aye, aye, sir!

282
00:15:51,294 --> 00:15:54,197
Now, full chops to the right!

283
00:15:54,897 --> 00:15:57,532
Mission accomplished.

284
00:15:57,666 --> 00:16:00,335
- Whoo!
- What was that?

285
00:16:00,468 --> 00:16:01,904
Not bad, kid.

286
00:16:02,038 --> 00:16:03,940
Where'd you learn
to handle a bubble like that?

287
00:16:04,073 --> 00:16:07,342
- In the bathtub, sir.
- And say no more.

288
00:16:07,475 --> 00:16:08,610
Yes, sir.

289
00:16:08,743 --> 00:16:10,445
I should have known.

290
00:16:10,579 --> 00:16:13,515
- Peanut?
- And the Pig?

291
00:16:16,185 --> 00:16:17,419
That's more like it.

292
00:16:17,552 --> 00:16:20,388
Look how happy
she is to see me.

293
00:16:22,657 --> 00:16:24,093
I don't know.

294
00:16:25,995 --> 00:16:28,164
What, are you kidding?
She's totally captivated.

295
00:16:28,297 --> 00:16:29,798
Could be something else.

296
00:16:29,932 --> 00:16:32,868
Ah, what do you know
about sheer animal magnetism?

297
00:16:33,002 --> 00:16:34,870
- It's big.
- That's true.

298
00:16:35,004 --> 00:16:36,538
- Huge.
- Now you're making sense.

299
00:16:36,671 --> 00:16:39,175
- Hot, hot!
- Smoking hot!

300
00:16:39,308 --> 00:16:41,409
- It's a volcano!
- It's a volcano.

301
00:16:41,543 --> 00:16:43,045
Hey, I like that.

302
00:16:43,179 --> 00:16:46,048
It's a volcano!

303
00:16:48,284 --> 00:16:49,484
That's what I said.

304
00:16:49,618 --> 00:16:50,752
well, you call that an excuse?

305
00:16:50,887 --> 00:16:52,221
We're headed right for it.

306
00:16:59,594 --> 00:17:00,795
We have to go left.

307
00:17:01,230 --> 00:17:04,166
Wrong way, wrong way,
wrong way, wrong way.

308
00:17:05,634 --> 00:17:06,768
I said left.

309
00:17:06,903 --> 00:17:08,371
- That was left.
- The other left.

310
00:17:08,503 --> 00:17:10,505
- This is all your fault.
- My fault?

311
00:17:10,639 --> 00:17:12,841
Why didn't you use
your "animal magnetism"?

312
00:17:12,975 --> 00:17:16,411
I'll use it later.
Right now, run!

313
00:17:23,219 --> 00:17:25,553
Don't breathe, Digg,
Digg, don't breathe.

314
00:17:27,722 --> 00:17:29,658
- Whoa, whoa!
- Here we go.

315
00:17:29,791 --> 00:17:31,360
Sorry!

316
00:17:31,493 --> 00:17:32,761
- Get off!
- I'm trying.

317
00:17:32,895 --> 00:17:35,131
- I'm hatched already.
- That tickles.

318
00:17:35,264 --> 00:17:37,133
- Stop.
- You stop!

319
00:17:37,266 --> 00:17:40,702
No, we have to stop. Now!

320
00:17:48,311 --> 00:17:50,545
Whoa, whoa,
oh, whoa!

321
00:17:52,681 --> 00:17:54,116
Pop it!

322
00:18:02,191 --> 00:18:03,558
We're doomed!

323
00:18:03,692 --> 00:18:06,195
You gotta admit,
that's some thick Goola Juice.

324
00:18:07,662 --> 00:18:09,165
Oh, my tummy.

325
00:18:13,102 --> 00:18:14,536
You did it!

326
00:18:18,307 --> 00:18:19,874
Hold on.

327
00:18:26,115 --> 00:18:28,951
We make it thick,
so it'll stick.

328
00:18:40,429 --> 00:18:41,863
Ah!

329
00:18:52,507 --> 00:18:55,744
You saved us.
You saved <i>me.</i>

330
00:18:55,878 --> 00:18:58,847
Yeah, well,
don't mention it, to anyone.

331
00:18:58,981 --> 00:19:00,682
We wouldn't want
people to talk.

332
00:19:00,815 --> 00:19:03,085
Does this mean we're friends?

333
00:19:03,219 --> 00:19:05,254
You see anybody
else around here?

334
00:19:06,222 --> 00:19:07,456
No, sir.

335
00:19:07,589 --> 00:19:10,226
Now, let's find a way
outta here.

336
00:19:10,359 --> 00:19:12,094
Short and sweet.

337
00:19:14,997 --> 00:19:17,967
Bubble burst, trapped
inside volcano, send help.

338
00:19:28,543 --> 00:19:29,778
"And food?

339
00:19:30,146 --> 00:19:32,481
"Preferably apple flaps,
Fruity Jacks, and a juice chaser

340
00:19:32,614 --> 00:19:34,549
"if you have room,
over and out.

341
00:19:36,886 --> 00:19:38,888
"PS, a fruit tart
would be nice, too."

342
00:19:40,956 --> 00:19:43,658
Go quick before he asks
to see the chef.

343
00:19:45,827 --> 00:19:47,762
Hey, what's your name anyway?

344
00:19:47,897 --> 00:19:50,598
You can call me Digg,
or you can call me Pig.

345
00:19:50,732 --> 00:19:52,001
Now you can call me P or D,

346
00:19:52,134 --> 00:19:53,635
or double-wide on the side,

347
00:19:53,768 --> 00:19:55,570
but don't you ever
call me late for dinner!

348
00:19:55,703 --> 00:19:58,107
Ah, I had to ask.
Somebody, save me.

349
00:20:05,181 --> 00:20:07,283
Hey, you mind
turning that down?

350
00:20:07,416 --> 00:20:08,583
We're lost.

351
00:20:10,086 --> 00:20:11,719
That's a perfect way
to get found.

352
00:20:13,822 --> 00:20:15,157
This way!

353
00:20:15,291 --> 00:20:16,591
That way?

354
00:20:16,724 --> 00:20:18,260
There is only one way
to settle this.

355
00:20:18,394 --> 00:20:20,563
If that's how you want it.

356
00:20:20,695 --> 00:20:24,366

You see,
I have a nose for directions.

360
00:20:40,849 --> 00:20:43,385
Must be part of the original
Goola machinery.

361
00:20:44,019 --> 00:20:46,922
- Let's take a look.
- Let's not and say we did.

362
00:20:53,129 --> 00:20:55,297
Why, no one's been here
in a fruit's age.

363
00:20:58,033 --> 00:20:59,368
Huh?

364
00:20:59,502 --> 00:21:01,237
Sir? Sir?

365
00:21:01,370 --> 00:21:02,837
Sir?

366
00:21:02,972 --> 00:21:05,074
It's a much better
view up here.

367
00:21:05,207 --> 00:21:07,276
You should try it.

368
00:21:07,409 --> 00:21:10,212
What is that?
What's all that noise?

369
00:21:11,779 --> 00:21:15,117
Ha! These machines
are still working.

370
00:21:15,251 --> 00:21:16,218
It's impossible.

371
00:21:16,352 --> 00:21:17,685
They haven't been used
for ages.

372
00:21:17,819 --> 00:21:18,954
Unless...

373
00:21:19,088 --> 00:21:21,557
We found the problem!

374
00:21:21,689 --> 00:21:22,892
I said we could do it.

375
00:21:23,025 --> 00:21:25,561
- No, you didn't.
- Well, my uncle said it.

376
00:21:25,693 --> 00:21:28,931
Now, if we can just figure out
how to turn them off.

377
00:21:29,632 --> 00:21:31,467

Do something!

389
00:22:01,897 --> 00:22:03,933
I just did
in my underwear.

390
00:22:08,836 --> 00:22:11,307
I'm out.
Ah, that's more like it.

391
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:13,209
I hope this works.

00:22:18,514 --> 00:22:19,915
Oh, fruit.

00:22:25,753 --> 00:22:29,857
- Hoo-hoo, I got one!
- Well, me, too.

394
00:22:29,992 --> 00:22:32,494
Mine's bigger than yours.

395
00:22:32,628 --> 00:22:34,196
We're flying.

396
00:22:41,003 --> 00:22:42,171
We're safe.

397
00:22:42,304 --> 00:22:45,040
- It's a miracle!
- No thanks to you.

398
00:22:45,174 --> 00:22:46,675

- Well, I'm not the one

00:22:46,808 --> 00:22:48,444
who boogied his booty
into that lever.

400
00:22:48,577 --> 00:22:50,212
You pushed the button.

401
00:22:50,346 --> 00:22:51,480
Oh, yeah?

402
00:22:51,614 --> 00:22:53,449
Well, who pulled the pin?

403
00:22:53,582 --> 00:22:55,417
Right over the mulcher?

404
00:23:05,160 --> 00:23:06,996
- Sir?
- How's my hair?

405
00:23:07,129 --> 00:23:08,897
- I'm starting to think...
- You got a comb?

406
00:23:09,031 --> 00:23:11,000
Maybe we're not really saved.

407
00:23:11,133 --> 00:23:12,668
What are you talking about?

408
00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:16,338
Maybe we're captured.

409
00:23:16,472 --> 00:23:18,507
Who are you?

410
00:23:18,641 --> 00:23:21,377
You can call me Digg,
or you can call me Pig.

411
00:23:21,510 --> 00:23:22,745
I'll do the talking.

412
00:23:22,878 --> 00:23:24,446
Who are <i>you?</i>

413
00:23:24,580 --> 00:23:27,316
Ugh. We asked first.

414
00:23:27,449 --> 00:23:28,850
It is polite.

415
00:23:28,984 --> 00:23:32,354
Oh, but I insist, you go first.

416
00:23:32,488 --> 00:23:35,057
We're warning you.

417
00:23:35,190 --> 00:23:38,160
Would you...
Could you just say that again?

418
00:23:38,294 --> 00:23:42,131
Don't play games with us
or you'll be sorry.

419
00:23:42,264 --> 00:23:44,400
Maybe they want to eat us.

420
00:23:48,537 --> 00:23:49,938
Will you look at that?

421
00:23:50,072 --> 00:23:51,540
It's a bat girl.

422
00:23:51,674 --> 00:23:55,911
- With a lovely bow.
- I ripped it off a bunny.

423
00:23:56,045 --> 00:23:57,713
You didn't?

424
00:23:57,845 --> 00:24:01,250
- Mm-hmm.
- What do you think you're doing?

425
00:24:02,217 --> 00:24:03,919
None of your business.

426
00:24:04,053 --> 00:24:06,388
You're consorting
with the prisoners.

427
00:24:06,522 --> 00:24:07,822
And what if I am?

428
00:24:07,956 --> 00:24:10,426
This is supposed to be
an interrogation.

429
00:24:10,559 --> 00:24:12,628
Oh, well, don't let us
interrupt you.

430
00:24:12,761 --> 00:24:14,229
Thank you.

431
00:24:14,363 --> 00:24:15,898
You be sure to find out
everything she knows.

432
00:24:16,031 --> 00:24:17,266
You know it.

433
00:24:17,399 --> 00:24:20,002
Hey, don't look at me
like that.

434
00:24:20,135 --> 00:24:22,171
I can talk to whoever I want.

435
00:24:22,304 --> 00:24:25,808
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

436
00:24:25,941 --> 00:24:28,744
And don't try to bully me,
Fufu.

437
00:24:28,877 --> 00:24:30,512
Don't call me that!

438
00:24:30,646 --> 00:24:34,216
Ooh, Fufu.

439
00:24:35,250 --> 00:24:36,919
Oops.

440
00:24:37,052 --> 00:24:39,888
Hey!

441
00:24:40,489 --> 00:24:42,024
Going somewhere?

442
00:24:42,157 --> 00:24:44,760
Why, I'm just admiring
the natural formations.

443
00:24:44,893 --> 00:24:46,895
You're our prisoners.

444
00:24:47,029 --> 00:24:48,130
We give up.

445
00:24:48,263 --> 00:24:50,032

fair and square,

446
00:24:50,165 --> 00:24:53,168

- We don't know any plan.
- Oh, yeah?

491
00:27:12,976 --> 00:27:15,811
Then why were you snooping
around the machines?

492
00:27:15,945 --> 00:27:18,180
Oh, you mean the plan?

493
00:27:18,313 --> 00:27:21,985
We thought you were talking
about some other plan.

494
00:27:22,117 --> 00:27:23,920
Everybody knows about the plan.

495
00:27:24,052 --> 00:27:26,021
- Right?
- Uh, right.

496
00:27:26,154 --> 00:27:28,023
You came here to sabotage it.

497
00:27:28,156 --> 00:27:31,895
Want to help? Oh!
I mean, no, no, no.

498
00:27:32,027 --> 00:27:33,161
Uh, what plan?

00:27:33,295 --> 00:27:35,230
Ah! Really?

500
00:27:35,364 --> 00:27:38,634
Look what you've done.
You've ruined everything.

501
00:27:38,767 --> 00:27:40,102
- Me?
- Follow my lead.

502
00:27:40,235 --> 00:27:42,137
You see anybody else
standing here

503
00:27:42,271 --> 00:27:44,273
revealing top secret
information?

504
00:27:44,406 --> 00:27:47,442
- But you said everybody knows.
- Well, sure.

505
00:27:47,576 --> 00:27:48,710
Now they do.

506
00:27:48,844 --> 00:27:50,279
They know about the plan?

507
00:27:50,412 --> 00:27:51,547
Well, of course
they know the plan.

508
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:53,282
- It's their plan.
- Not our plan?

509
00:27:53,415 --> 00:27:55,651
- Except now they know we know.
- About our plan?

510
00:27:55,784 --> 00:27:58,153
- Obviously, it's our plan.
- And everybody knows?

511
00:27:58,287 --> 00:27:59,521
- Nobody knows.
- No?

512
00:27:59,655 --> 00:28:02,057
- Yes.
- Yes, nobody knows the plan?

513
00:28:02,190 --> 00:28:04,192
No, everybody knows the plan.

514
00:28:04,326 --> 00:28:05,694
Which plan?

515
00:28:05,827 --> 00:28:09,164
Well, buddy, there's only
one way to find out.

Sir?

521
00:28:43,732 --> 00:28:45,167
When I said follow my lead,

522
00:28:45,300 --> 00:28:46,735
that's not what I meant.

523
00:28:48,004 --> 00:28:49,438

Still, you weren't
half bad back there.

525

In fact, I'd say this could be
the start of a harmonious union

527
00:28:58,513 --> 00:29:00,582
Not to be interpreted
as a union endorsement.

528
00:29:00,716 --> 00:29:02,684
How could something
like this happen, sir?

529
00:29:02,818 --> 00:29:04,586
- It's terrible.
- You're telling me.

530
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:07,924
That song never fails.
I sing, she swoons.

531
00:29:08,057 --> 00:29:09,191
Woo, woo, woo.

532
00:29:09,324 --> 00:29:10,826
Do you know what this means?

533
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:12,661
I could be losing my touch.

534
00:29:12,794 --> 00:29:13,963
Say it ain't so.

535
00:29:14,097 --> 00:29:16,032
It's not a malfunction at all.

536
00:29:16,164 --> 00:29:18,300
- Keep talking.
- It's sabotage.

537
00:29:18,433 --> 00:29:19,768
I think I see
where you're going.

538
00:29:19,902 --> 00:29:21,403
That's how the bats know
about the machines.

539
00:29:21,536 --> 00:29:23,906
Machines?
Who cares about the machines?

540
00:29:24,040 --> 00:29:25,173
We're talking about me.

541
00:29:25,307 --> 00:29:26,976
How could they
do this to Goola?

542
00:29:27,110 --> 00:29:28,510
We need reinforcements.

543
00:29:28,644 --> 00:29:30,113
Everyone needs to know
what's going on here.

544
00:29:30,245 --> 00:29:31,480
But I thought everybody knows?

545
00:29:31,613 --> 00:29:33,148
No, no, nobody knows.

546
00:29:33,281 --> 00:29:35,118
- About our plan?
- About their plan.

547
00:29:35,250 --> 00:29:36,685
Don't you listen to anything?

548
00:29:40,722 --> 00:29:42,357
Maybe we should go
looking for them.

549
00:29:42,491 --> 00:29:43,960
There's no time for that.

550
00:29:44,093 --> 00:29:45,360
You said it yourself.

551
00:29:45,494 --> 00:29:47,562
The fate of Goola
hangs in the balance.

552
00:29:47,696 --> 00:29:50,565
I know, I know,
I did the calculations.

553
00:29:50,699 --> 00:29:53,802
I just hope wherever they are,
they're safe.

554
00:29:53,936 --> 00:29:56,638
We have to face facts.
Anything could have happened.

555
00:29:56,772 --> 00:29:58,407
Their bubble could have burst.

556
00:29:58,540 --> 00:30:00,043
They could have plunged
into boiling lava.

557
00:30:00,175 --> 00:30:01,944
There's snake caves,
bottomless pits,

558
00:30:02,078 --> 00:30:03,245
deadly mudflats.

559
00:30:03,378 --> 00:30:06,049
And that's just for starters.

560
00:30:06,181 --> 00:30:07,884
Eh, but I'm sure they're fine.

561
00:30:08,017 --> 00:30:10,086
Yeah. Me, too.

562
00:30:10,218 --> 00:30:14,389
Heh. Not everyone is cut out
for this kind of adventure.

563
00:30:16,324 --> 00:30:18,560
We'll just have to go it alone.

564
00:30:23,298 --> 00:30:25,367
Don't worry,
I'll protect you.

565
00:30:25,500 --> 00:30:28,938
And of course, we'll keep
an eye out for the others.

566
00:30:31,707 --> 00:30:34,810
- Ow!
- Wha... What's wrong?

567
00:30:34,944 --> 00:30:37,713
My eye! My...

568
00:30:40,415 --> 00:30:41,717
Cheek?

569
00:30:41,850 --> 00:30:44,786
Eech, eech, ooch, ooch,
ouch, ouch...

570
00:30:44,921 --> 00:30:46,221
Cheek?

571
00:30:46,354 --> 00:30:51,194
Something in my eye.
Is it an eyelash?

572
00:30:53,963 --> 00:30:56,698
It's a message.

573
00:30:58,101 --> 00:30:59,735
From Peanut!

574
00:30:59,868 --> 00:31:01,204
They're alive!

575
00:31:01,336 --> 00:31:04,406
Isn't that... lucky?

576
00:31:04,539 --> 00:31:06,175
It must have come
from this way.

577
00:31:06,308 --> 00:31:07,743
Let's go.

578
00:31:14,282 --> 00:31:16,919
Ouch, eech, eech, oh...

579
00:31:30,365 --> 00:31:32,501
Hey! I'm not a banana.

580
00:31:39,142 --> 00:31:40,776
- Oops!
- Got you.

581
00:31:41,576 --> 00:31:43,278
The tremors are happening
more frequently.

582
00:31:43,411 --> 00:31:44,846
Ouch, ooh!

583
00:31:44,981 --> 00:31:46,414
We'd better hurry.

584
00:31:49,751 --> 00:31:51,087
It's getting brighter.

585
00:31:51,220 --> 00:31:52,989
Cheek, look.

586
00:31:53,588 --> 00:31:57,459
Wow. It's beautiful.

587
00:32:07,003 --> 00:32:10,472
Ooh, better be careful.
There's danger even in beauty.

588
00:32:10,605 --> 00:32:13,943
That's why I have to keep
my guard up against you.

589
00:32:23,052 --> 00:32:25,320
You really should stay
close to me.

590
00:32:38,834 --> 00:32:40,102
Ah!

591
00:32:40,735 --> 00:32:43,072
Ow, ow, ouch, ooh, ooh...

592
00:32:45,507 --> 00:32:46,943
Agh!

593
00:32:50,779 --> 00:32:52,982
I feel like
we're going the wrong way.

594
00:32:53,115 --> 00:32:54,416
Nonsense.

595
00:32:54,549 --> 00:32:56,718
I have an unerring
sense of direction.

596
00:32:57,452 --> 00:32:58,653
No, really.

597
00:32:58,787 --> 00:33:00,488
I'm sure
we should be going that way.

598
00:33:00,622 --> 00:33:02,724
It's just a trick of the light.

599
00:33:02,858 --> 00:33:04,093
Trust me.

600
00:33:07,495 --> 00:33:08,697
Cheek!

601
00:33:08,830 --> 00:33:10,199
For the love of Goola,

602
00:33:10,333 --> 00:33:11,633
woman, we're going this way!

603
00:33:11,766 --> 00:33:14,402
There's something out there.

604
00:33:14,536 --> 00:33:16,005
Huh?

605
00:33:16,438 --> 00:33:18,074
I saw it move.

606
00:33:19,741 --> 00:33:22,844
Oh, of course you did.

607
00:33:25,348 --> 00:33:27,149
Another trick of the light?

608
00:33:30,719 --> 00:33:35,091
Let us proceed.

609
00:33:51,873 --> 00:33:53,276
Ow, ooh!

610
00:33:58,847 --> 00:34:00,615
- What the...
- Huh?

611
00:34:02,084 --> 00:34:05,720
- We got them, we got them.
- Not too close.

612
00:34:06,355 --> 00:34:07,789
Oh, hi.

613
00:34:08,790 --> 00:34:11,593
- What the fruit?
- Peanut?

614
00:34:11,726 --> 00:34:14,796
- Hey, you guys.
- You!

615
00:34:14,931 --> 00:34:18,600
Sorry about that.
Can't be too careful out here.

616
00:34:18,733 --> 00:34:20,702
I hope
you didn't bruise your ego.

617
00:34:20,835 --> 00:34:23,105
Not everyone's cut out
for this kind of adventure,

618
00:34:23,239 --> 00:34:24,706
you know?

619
00:34:26,108 --> 00:34:27,243
We got your beetle.

620
00:34:27,376 --> 00:34:28,510
Lucky for you.

621
00:34:28,643 --> 00:34:29,778
Otherwise, who knows how long

622
00:34:29,912 --> 00:34:31,314
you would have been lost?

623
00:34:31,446 --> 00:34:33,916
- We're not lost.
- And we didn't find you.

624
00:34:35,717 --> 00:34:37,253
You must be tired and hungry.

625
00:34:37,752 --> 00:34:40,323
- Affirmative.
- Let's go back to our camp.

626
00:34:49,731 --> 00:34:51,466
This is your camp?

627
00:34:53,035 --> 00:34:55,670
We had to make do
with what we could find.

628
00:34:56,671 --> 00:34:59,507
There's nothing quite
like living off the land.

629
00:35:04,679 --> 00:35:07,515
Mm, what is
that wonderful aroma?

630
00:35:09,784 --> 00:35:12,254
If everyone could please
take a seat.

631
00:35:14,190 --> 00:35:16,558
Dinner is served.

632
00:35:17,326 --> 00:35:18,593
Mmm.

633
00:35:18,727 --> 00:35:20,795
- I call it happy soup.
- Why?

634
00:35:20,930 --> 00:35:22,264
Because whenever I taste it

635
00:35:22,398 --> 00:35:24,333
I get a warm,
happy feeling all over.

636
00:35:24,833 --> 00:35:27,136
You have outdone yourself,
my friend.

637
00:35:27,269 --> 00:35:28,670
Why, thank you.

638
00:35:28,803 --> 00:35:30,839
Do you know where
the best mushrooms come from?

639
00:35:30,973 --> 00:35:32,607
You're going to love this.

640
00:35:32,741 --> 00:35:35,277
- Poop.
- Poop?

641
00:35:35,411 --> 00:35:39,647
As in, they're the poop.

642
00:35:39,781 --> 00:35:42,817
Ugh, that's not funny.

643
00:35:42,952 --> 00:35:45,254
Nah, they're better than poop.

644
00:35:45,388 --> 00:35:47,522
Oh, thank Goola.

645
00:35:47,655 --> 00:35:49,992
These are from bat poop.

646
00:35:50,126 --> 00:35:52,694
And those bats are
friends of ours.

647
00:35:53,561 --> 00:35:55,830
To good food,
good friends.

648
00:35:55,965 --> 00:35:57,866
Present company excluded.

649
00:35:59,468 --> 00:36:01,904
And googly-eyed fungus.

650
00:36:03,605 --> 00:36:04,940
Well, that's weird.

651
00:36:05,074 --> 00:36:06,142
All right.

652
00:36:06,275 --> 00:36:08,110
There's only one thing
better than this.

653
00:36:08,643 --> 00:36:11,247
- A mud bath?
- Nope.

654
00:36:11,380 --> 00:36:13,615
A manicure and foot massage?

655
00:36:13,748 --> 00:36:16,085

No! Oh!

728
00:40:22,298 --> 00:40:23,932
Mr. Pink?

729
00:40:28,237 --> 00:40:29,804
What are you doing here?

730
00:40:29,938 --> 00:40:31,407
I'm the one
who should be asking

731
00:40:31,540 --> 00:40:34,842
what you're doing so far away
from Goola City.

732
00:40:42,785 --> 00:40:44,153
Easy for you to say.

733
00:40:48,424 --> 00:40:52,294
And have you found the problem?

734
00:40:52,661 --> 00:40:54,430
No, sir. Nothing so far.

735
00:40:54,963 --> 00:40:57,366
Well, I wouldn't
exactly say nothing.

736
00:40:58,100 --> 00:40:59,301
- What?
- In fact,

737
00:40:59,435 --> 00:41:02,137
I'd say something.
How about you?

738
00:41:02,271 --> 00:41:03,806
- Would you say something?
- Something.

739
00:41:03,939 --> 00:41:06,742
- Peanut?
- My porcine pal here and I

740
00:41:06,874 --> 00:41:08,344
have discovered
the problem.

741
00:41:08,477 --> 00:41:10,779
- That's impossible.
- What did you find?

742
00:41:10,913 --> 00:41:12,414
It's the fruit bats.

743
00:41:12,548 --> 00:41:14,416
They've been monkeying
around with the old machines

744
00:41:14,550 --> 00:41:16,085
to disrupt the system.

745
00:41:16,218 --> 00:41:18,454
I'll have, you know, that figure
of speech is offensive,

746
00:41:18,587 --> 00:41:20,022
and entirely accurate.

747
00:41:20,155 --> 00:41:22,024
Why would the bats want
to disrupt the system?

748
00:41:22,157 --> 00:41:25,928
Hmm, they were there
when we originally built it.

749
00:41:26,061 --> 00:41:27,329
There have been rumors

750
00:41:27,463 --> 00:41:29,465
the bats are unhappy
that Goola City

751
00:41:29,598 --> 00:41:32,401
isn't sharing enough fruits
of their labor.

752
00:41:32,768 --> 00:41:37,005
You two, have done
very good work indeed.

753
00:41:51,987 --> 00:41:54,056
Congratulations.

754
00:41:54,556 --> 00:41:56,258
If all the fruit bats
are in on it,

755
00:41:56,392 --> 00:41:57,926
we're going to need
a much bigger team

756
00:41:58,060 --> 00:41:59,528
to root them out.

757
00:41:59,661 --> 00:42:02,531
In that case, I'll lead
you back to Goola City.

758
00:42:02,664 --> 00:42:04,233
We better send
a messenger beetle back

759
00:42:04,366 --> 00:42:05,968
so Moneke
can start preparing.

760
00:42:06,101 --> 00:42:08,704
Good idea.
Fireworks, fruit sculptures,

761
00:42:08,837 --> 00:42:10,205
a ticker tape parade.

762
00:42:10,339 --> 00:42:12,274
There's a lot to organize
for a hero's return.

763
00:42:12,408 --> 00:42:14,710
I meant preparing the team.

764
00:42:14,843 --> 00:42:17,479
Oh, well, that too.

765
00:42:17,613 --> 00:42:19,047
There's no need.

766
00:42:19,181 --> 00:42:20,949
The trip won't take us long.

767
00:42:21,083 --> 00:42:22,217
Just to be safe.

768
00:42:27,891 --> 00:42:29,391
Oh, look out!

769
00:42:30,626 --> 00:42:33,595
We should get underway.

770
00:42:39,168 --> 00:42:41,703
Tasty.

771
00:42:42,604 --> 00:42:45,541
The way out should
be somewhere up ahead.

772
00:42:46,642 --> 00:42:49,913
Say, Flo, I've been thinking.
You, me, <i>Château Mango</i>?

773
00:42:50,045 --> 00:42:51,213
Sound like a plan?

774
00:42:51,346 --> 00:42:52,648
Maybe you've noticed

775
00:42:52,781 --> 00:42:54,750
we're in the middle
of a fungal jungle

776
00:42:54,884 --> 00:42:56,485
Now that I've saved Goola

777
00:42:56,618 --> 00:42:58,554
you'll want to get on that
schedule as soon as possible.

778
00:42:58,687 --> 00:43:00,589
Aren't you getting
a little ahead of yourself?

779
00:43:00,722 --> 00:43:03,258
Actually, I'm trying to get
ahead of you.

780
00:43:03,392 --> 00:43:06,094
Careful,
or you might lose your way.

781
00:43:06,962 --> 00:43:09,364
Not going to happen. You see...

782
00:43:09,498 --> 00:43:11,633
<i>♪ I'm never lost
when I'm with you ♪</i>

783
00:43:13,502 --> 00:43:15,871
Sorry, I've heard
from half the girls in Goola,

784
00:43:16,004 --> 00:43:17,773
and I'm not falling
for your song.

785
00:43:17,907 --> 00:43:19,208
Only half.

786
00:43:19,341 --> 00:43:22,277
I'm looking for someone
who's sincere.

787
00:43:22,411 --> 00:43:25,514
- Oh, now, don't be pessimistic.
- Hard working.

788
00:43:25,647 --> 00:43:28,183
Let me carry
that heavy pack for you.

789
00:43:29,886 --> 00:43:31,353
- Humble.
- Did I mention?

790
00:43:31,487 --> 00:43:33,890
I couldn't have done it
without the pig.

791
00:43:34,022 --> 00:43:37,559
- Exactly. Someone like Digg?
- You mean in maintenance?

792
00:43:37,693 --> 00:43:40,729
It's not what a guy does,
but how he does it that counts.

793
00:43:46,034 --> 00:43:48,837
I see what you mean.
He's a good egg.

794
00:43:48,972 --> 00:43:52,708
Just look at him.
He could hatch at any moment.

795
00:43:52,841 --> 00:43:54,476
Hard as it is to say,

796
00:43:54,610 --> 00:43:57,212
I humbly and sincerely
wish you both happiness.

797
00:43:57,346 --> 00:44:00,582
I didn't say Digg.

798
00:44:00,716 --> 00:44:03,151
I said someone like Digg.

799
00:44:03,285 --> 00:44:06,188
Oh, I can dig that.

800
00:44:07,022 --> 00:44:10,292
I just need a few minutes.

801
00:44:10,425 --> 00:44:13,262
Forgive me,

802
00:44:13,395 --> 00:44:15,999
I'm not as slow as I once was.

803
00:44:16,164 --> 00:44:17,299
Take your time.

804
00:44:17,432 --> 00:44:19,067
While you're resting,

805
00:44:19,201 --> 00:44:20,536
we'll go look for ourselves.

806
00:44:20,669 --> 00:44:23,505
And I'll...
and I'll keep a lookout here.

807
00:44:25,807 --> 00:44:27,209
Looks good to me.

808
00:44:27,342 --> 00:44:29,311
All righty, then. Let's go.

809
00:44:30,412 --> 00:44:32,514
You look like you could
use a little support.

810
00:44:32,648 --> 00:44:34,416
Thanks.

811
00:44:39,221 --> 00:44:41,823
This way out seems
more like the way in.

812
00:44:49,264 --> 00:44:51,667
- Help!
- That sounded like...

813
00:44:51,800 --> 00:44:56,071
Gee, maybe the old fella fell
down and can't get up!

814
00:44:57,606 --> 00:45:00,809
Well, if he fell down,
he sure did get up.

815
00:45:01,076 --> 00:45:02,744
The Bats have him!

816
00:45:02,879 --> 00:45:04,479
Catch them! Ow.

817
00:45:07,749 --> 00:45:09,184
What the...

818
00:45:12,187 --> 00:45:13,522
Look out!

819
00:45:13,655 --> 00:45:16,059
It's days like this
that give days like this

820
00:45:16,191 --> 00:45:17,826
a bad reputation.

821
00:45:17,961 --> 00:45:19,828
Hey, we gotta get out of here.

822
00:45:22,130 --> 00:45:23,565
Peanut!

823
00:45:24,533 --> 00:45:26,035
Pull!

824
00:45:36,645 --> 00:45:38,413
Cheek!

825
00:46:04,506 --> 00:46:05,741
See, like that.

826
00:46:05,874 --> 00:46:07,542
Parry, duck.
Dueling with a fungus.

827
00:46:07,676 --> 00:46:10,579
Leap, swing,
and totally outmatched.

828
00:46:15,985 --> 00:46:17,586
Oh, great.

829
00:46:23,092 --> 00:46:25,327
Hey, stick around, will ya?

830
00:46:25,460 --> 00:46:26,595
What's he doing?

831
00:46:30,632 --> 00:46:32,935
Come on, come on,
come on, come on, over here.

832
00:46:37,006 --> 00:46:38,740
All aboard!

833
00:46:38,874 --> 00:46:40,342
Peanut, that's brilliant.

834
00:46:40,475 --> 00:46:42,344
I figure bunnies like to hop.

835
00:46:42,477 --> 00:46:44,613
Hold this for me.

836
00:46:45,380 --> 00:46:46,815
First class all the way.

837
00:46:55,624 --> 00:46:57,960
- Boopsie.
- Oops!

838
00:46:58,094 --> 00:47:01,430
Oops!
I'll show you, oops!

839
00:47:05,200 --> 00:47:07,003
- You're riding?
- I'm there.

840
00:47:20,016 --> 00:47:21,918
Fancy meeting you here.

841
00:47:25,287 --> 00:47:27,222
- Touchdown.
- Anybody ever tell you

842
00:47:27,355 --> 00:47:29,291
you have a future
in cannonballs?

843
00:47:29,424 --> 00:47:31,259
Let's find Flo!

844
00:47:36,832 --> 00:47:38,101
There she is.

845
00:47:38,233 --> 00:47:39,701
I got you.

846
00:47:40,435 --> 00:47:43,005
We hope you enjoyed
your flight today.

847
00:47:43,139 --> 00:47:44,840
It really worked.

848
00:47:46,274 --> 00:47:48,343
I prefer flying jumbos myself.

849
00:47:48,477 --> 00:47:51,580
- This pig can fly.
- Oh, shucks.

850
00:47:55,184 --> 00:47:56,485
Hey, it's Mr. Pink.

851
00:47:56,618 --> 00:47:57,853
- You!
- That's right.

852
00:47:57,987 --> 00:48:00,355
We made it out.
No thanks to you.

853
00:48:00,489 --> 00:48:03,159
I saw the bats drop him.
He needed my help.

854
00:48:03,291 --> 00:48:05,061
Oh, are you hurt?

855
00:48:05,194 --> 00:48:07,063
No.

856
00:48:07,196 --> 00:48:08,630
Just old, my dear.

857
00:48:08,764 --> 00:48:10,967
Good thing I held on to this.

858
00:48:11,100 --> 00:48:13,236
Ah, my trusty.

859
00:48:13,368 --> 00:48:14,569
Thank you.

860
00:48:14,703 --> 00:48:16,538
We were just
coming to find you.

861
00:48:16,671 --> 00:48:18,840
Luckily for us, we had Peanut.

862
00:48:19,242 --> 00:48:21,409
He sure saved my bacon.

863
00:48:21,543 --> 00:48:23,913
Your uncle would be proud.

864
00:48:24,046 --> 00:48:25,547
Don't get carried away.

865
00:48:25,680 --> 00:48:27,950
Once was enough, I assure you.

866
00:48:28,350 --> 00:48:30,385
I was just saving my own skin.

867
00:48:30,519 --> 00:48:33,421
Now we know you were right
about the bats.

868
00:48:33,555 --> 00:48:37,059
They obviously used me
to try and trap you.

869
00:48:37,193 --> 00:48:39,761
Let's get moving.

870
00:48:54,944 --> 00:48:56,411
Ew!

871
00:48:56,545 --> 00:48:58,580
Don't be sweating on me, hog!

872
00:48:58,713 --> 00:49:01,650
B... b... but it's so hot.

873
00:49:03,752 --> 00:49:06,621
That's some spring
in your step, Mr. Pink.

874
00:49:07,190 --> 00:49:11,227
Oh, yes, the volcanic warmth
agrees with me.

875
00:49:12,627 --> 00:49:13,930
Look at that!

876
00:49:14,063 --> 00:49:16,232
Is that a bromance
in the making I see?

877
00:49:16,398 --> 00:49:19,202
I'm starting to get a funny
feeling about all this.

878
00:49:19,334 --> 00:49:21,837
Me too.
Something stinks.

879
00:49:21,971 --> 00:49:24,706
- That's just you.
- Oh yeah.

880
00:49:24,840 --> 00:49:27,843
What do we really know about
that old sloth anyway?

881
00:49:27,977 --> 00:49:32,148
He's one of the original Goola
founders and a living legend.

882
00:49:32,281 --> 00:49:33,950
Oh, that!

883
00:49:39,956 --> 00:49:42,291
Now, I know what they mean by
if you can't stand the heat,

884
00:49:42,424 --> 00:49:43,725
stay out of the volcano.

885
00:49:43,859 --> 00:49:46,428
What's the matter?
Can't you take it?

886
00:49:47,230 --> 00:49:49,764
Well, you know, it's not the
heat, it's the stupidity.

887
00:49:49,899 --> 00:49:52,201
I think we're going deeper
into the volcano.

888
00:49:52,335 --> 00:49:53,970
Away from Goola City.

889
00:49:54,103 --> 00:49:55,905
It's just lava pockets.

890
00:49:56,038 --> 00:49:58,573
We have to pass through them
on the way out.

891
00:49:59,008 --> 00:50:00,709
Ah, see there.

892
00:50:00,842 --> 00:50:04,412
The journey is almost over.

893
00:50:07,449 --> 00:50:09,151
Where are we?

894
00:50:14,257 --> 00:50:16,058
Not the exit that's for sure.

895
00:50:16,192 --> 00:50:20,729
The Central Cone!

896
00:50:20,862 --> 00:50:23,132
Did I mention I have
a nose for danger?

897
00:50:23,266 --> 00:50:25,767
That looks like the Goola juice
bubble maker.

898
00:50:28,004 --> 00:50:30,006
Only that's no juice bubble.

899
00:50:30,139 --> 00:50:31,539
That's lava.

900
00:50:33,075 --> 00:50:35,378
The lava bubbles are so heavy

901
00:50:35,510 --> 00:50:37,846
they're weighing
down the entire system.

902
00:50:37,980 --> 00:50:40,082
They're what's causing
the island to sink.

903
00:50:41,483 --> 00:50:44,753
Let's get out of here.
We have to tell Uncle Moneke.

904
00:50:49,926 --> 00:50:53,728
Whoa!
Now that's an avalanche!

905
00:50:54,429 --> 00:50:57,266
Hey! The boulder
almost flattened me!

906
00:50:57,400 --> 00:50:59,434
Flattened us, you mean?

907
00:50:59,567 --> 00:51:02,204
Sorry about that, Boss!

908
00:51:02,338 --> 00:51:05,174
Boss?
You?

909
00:51:07,842 --> 00:51:11,746
And you! You're all
in on the secret plot together.

910
00:51:12,381 --> 00:51:14,716
Not bad for an old fossil, eh?

911
00:51:14,849 --> 00:51:16,785
It was just a matter of
modifying some of

912
00:51:16,919 --> 00:51:20,289
the original Goola machinery
that had been abandoned.

913
00:51:20,423 --> 00:51:23,858
- But why?
- Oh. But why?

914
00:51:23,993 --> 00:51:27,495
Because I saved Goola,
it was me.

915
00:51:27,629 --> 00:51:31,334
- I built all these machines.
- Impressive.

916
00:51:31,466 --> 00:51:33,169
Ah! Just saying.

917
00:51:33,302 --> 00:51:36,571
But your great grand-ape
took all the credit

918
00:51:36,705 --> 00:51:38,341
and all the glory.

919
00:51:38,473 --> 00:51:40,809
You monkeys live like kings.

920
00:51:40,943 --> 00:51:44,080
While all I got was
a golden pineapple

921
00:51:44,213 --> 00:51:48,884
and a pat on the back!
No one knows what I built,

922
00:51:49,018 --> 00:51:53,488
but they'll know
when I destroy it.

923
00:51:53,621 --> 00:51:57,826
What do you mean destroy it?
That wasn't part of the deal.

924
00:51:57,960 --> 00:51:59,728
No?

925
00:51:59,861 --> 00:52:03,665
Always a little late to
the party aren't you, my boy?

926
00:52:04,333 --> 00:52:06,601
That is why I chose you.

927
00:52:06,735 --> 00:52:08,304
We were only supposed
to make them think

928
00:52:08,437 --> 00:52:09,838
the island was sinking.

929
00:52:09,972 --> 00:52:12,540
Then we'd save everyone
and rule Goola together.

930
00:52:14,410 --> 00:52:18,546
As if I would share power
with another cheeky monkey.

931
00:52:18,680 --> 00:52:20,615
Never!

932
00:52:20,749 --> 00:52:22,251
You betrayed me.

933
00:52:22,385 --> 00:52:24,719
Don't take it so hard.
You betrayed me and we...

934
00:52:24,853 --> 00:52:27,023
- never mind.
- But if the island sinks

935
00:52:27,156 --> 00:52:29,724
what about all the Goola fruit
you promised us?

936
00:52:29,858 --> 00:52:32,228
Don't you see?
He tricked all of you.

937
00:52:32,361 --> 00:52:33,528
Everyone.

938
00:52:33,661 --> 00:52:36,598
- No fruit?
- No juice?

939
00:52:36,731 --> 00:52:39,001
No anything.

940
00:52:51,013 --> 00:52:53,516
You didn't think I was planning
to go down with

941
00:52:53,648 --> 00:52:55,617
the rest of the island,
did you?

942
00:52:55,750 --> 00:52:58,421
After Goola sinks,
I will rebuild

943
00:52:58,553 --> 00:53:01,057
on the volcano that remains.

944
00:53:16,138 --> 00:53:17,973
Hurry, Hurry, hurry!

945
00:53:18,107 --> 00:53:20,608
Let's go, let's go!

946
00:53:20,742 --> 00:53:23,645
Stupid.
This is not my job.

947
00:53:25,381 --> 00:53:31,353
Revenge is the sweetest
fruit of all.

948
00:53:31,921 --> 00:53:34,390
Wait a minute,
didn't you forget something?

949
00:53:35,124 --> 00:53:38,194
- Pardon?
- Um, uh...

950
00:53:38,327 --> 00:53:40,162
I'm too young to die?

951
00:53:40,963 --> 00:53:43,665
- Goodbye!
- Stop him!

952
00:53:48,971 --> 00:53:53,142
- Target acquired.
- Locked and loaded.

953
00:53:54,477 --> 00:53:57,179
Dive, dive, dive!

954
00:54:03,018 --> 00:54:05,387
Ouch. What are we doing?

955
00:54:05,521 --> 00:54:07,523
- Huh?
- We got wings.

956
00:54:07,655 --> 00:54:09,992
Oh, so?

957
00:54:10,126 --> 00:54:12,161
Oh!

958
00:54:12,561 --> 00:54:13,929
Let's get out of here.

959
00:54:14,063 --> 00:54:16,631
You're smarter
than you look, Fufu.

960
00:54:23,439 --> 00:54:25,141
We have to climb.

961
00:54:27,510 --> 00:54:31,380
Guys, guys.
Guys!

962
00:54:33,249 --> 00:54:35,618
- What's the matter?
- Pigs can't climb

963
00:54:35,750 --> 00:54:38,888
Last I heard
they can't fly, either.

964
00:54:39,889 --> 00:54:41,756
Hey, yeah!

965
00:54:41,891 --> 00:54:43,492
let's get shakin' bacon.

966
00:54:43,626 --> 00:54:45,161
Yeah. After you, sir.

967
00:54:45,294 --> 00:54:47,029
Huh?

968
00:54:48,631 --> 00:54:50,032
Yah-hoo!

969
00:54:50,166 --> 00:54:53,202
There we are, all for
one and one for all.

970
00:54:53,335 --> 00:54:54,537
That's my motto.

971
00:54:54,669 --> 00:54:56,138
Since when?

972
00:54:56,272 --> 00:54:57,805
Since right now.

973
00:54:57,940 --> 00:55:00,442
There's nowhere left to go.

974
00:55:03,212 --> 00:55:05,114
I hope that works out for you.

975
00:55:06,549 --> 00:55:09,084
So this is it.

976
00:55:09,218 --> 00:55:12,754
Somehow, I always imagined when
the end finally came,

977
00:55:12,888 --> 00:55:14,789
I'd be somewhere else.

978
00:55:16,158 --> 00:55:19,228
Come on.
We can't let this beat us.

979
00:55:19,361 --> 00:55:20,728
What can we do?

980
00:55:20,862 --> 00:55:23,132
We can look death in the eye.

981
00:55:23,899 --> 00:55:25,267
We can laugh.

982
00:55:28,270 --> 00:55:30,105
- We can kiss.
- Well...

983
00:55:30,239 --> 00:55:33,409
Oh, great Goola!
Hurry up and end it!

984
00:55:34,543 --> 00:55:35,877
What?

985
00:55:36,011 --> 00:55:37,546
I don't think,
this pipe is load-bearing.

986
00:55:37,680 --> 00:55:38,813
- Who cares?
- But... but... but...

987
00:55:38,948 --> 00:55:40,182
- Kind of busy.
- It might...

988
00:55:40,316 --> 00:55:42,117
You ever hear
the phrase now or never?

989
00:55:43,252 --> 00:55:45,020
Break.

990
00:55:55,264 --> 00:55:56,532
Bubbles.

991
00:55:56,665 --> 00:55:59,834
Gotcha.
They're too small.

992
00:55:59,969 --> 00:56:03,305
Stop grabbing!
Let them stick to you.

993
00:56:15,451 --> 00:56:17,086
Phew.

994
00:56:17,852 --> 00:56:21,390
Madam, how do you do?

995
00:56:21,523 --> 00:56:22,658
Oops.

996
00:56:28,964 --> 00:56:30,466
It's working.

997
00:56:33,636 --> 00:56:35,170
We're alive?

998
00:56:37,406 --> 00:56:38,741
That's right.

999
00:56:38,873 --> 00:56:41,410
I fly all the time!

1000
00:56:42,877 --> 00:56:44,313
If we had booked early,

1001
00:56:44,446 --> 00:56:46,382
we could have gotten better
seats.

1002
00:56:46,515 --> 00:56:48,884
- Oh, Peanut.
- Did someone say peanuts.

1003
00:56:49,018 --> 00:56:51,553
Nuts!
You're all nuts!

1004
00:56:54,856 --> 00:56:57,893
- Look!
- It's going down.

1005
00:56:58,027 --> 00:56:59,561
Uncle Moneke.

1006
00:57:01,863 --> 00:57:05,467
- Oh, dear!
- I don't know how to swim.

1007
00:57:05,601 --> 00:57:08,170
Everyone.

1008
00:57:09,438 --> 00:57:12,041
Well, at least we made it.

1009
00:57:14,209 --> 00:57:16,578
We have to do something.

1010
00:57:16,712 --> 00:57:19,281
Do what? It's all over.

1011
00:57:21,617 --> 00:57:23,519
It really is over.

1012
00:57:23,652 --> 00:57:26,388
Now I'll never get
the penthouse office.

1013
00:57:27,089 --> 00:57:30,092
It's not over. It's not over
unless we give up.

1014
00:57:30,225 --> 00:57:32,328
And unless you're not the
monkey I think you are.

1015
00:57:32,461 --> 00:57:35,698
You'll never give up,
you're too obtuse to give up.

1016
00:57:36,365 --> 00:57:38,866
You think I'm obtuse? Hm...

1017
00:57:39,001 --> 00:57:41,804
<i>Getting your hands
a little dirty now, Peanut,</i>

1018
00:57:41,937 --> 00:57:44,139
<i>is good preparation
for later.</i>

1019
00:57:46,275 --> 00:57:48,777
We need to go that way.
Can you do it?

1020
00:57:49,445 --> 00:57:53,015
No problem.
I got a full tank.

1021
00:57:53,148 --> 00:57:55,651
What are you doing?

1022
00:57:56,719 --> 00:58:00,489
- We have to break the machines.
- Are you crazy?

1023
00:58:00,622 --> 00:58:02,791
You'll get us all killed.

1024
00:58:14,503 --> 00:58:15,938
That was a mistake.

1025
00:58:16,071 --> 00:58:18,873
This is how
you break something.

1026
00:58:22,311 --> 00:58:24,446
You two don't know what
you're doing.

1027
00:58:24,580 --> 00:58:27,082
I'll show you how to disable
this machine.

1028
00:58:36,692 --> 00:58:38,360
Let's do it!

1029
00:58:38,494 --> 00:58:41,497
- Back it up, Pig!
- Okeydokey, sir.

1030
00:58:46,068 --> 00:58:48,303
I still have faith in Peanut.

1031
00:58:48,437 --> 00:58:50,839
- I don't know how to swim.
- Pink?

1032
00:59:03,685 --> 00:59:04,920
It's working.

1033
00:59:07,856 --> 00:59:09,558
What?

1034
00:59:10,125 --> 00:59:13,429
Ooh! fun!

1035
00:59:23,372 --> 00:59:26,642
If we get this, it should
finish off the whole system.

1036
00:59:26,775 --> 00:59:28,177
I don't think so.

1037
00:59:28,310 --> 00:59:31,079
I won't let you stop what
I've begun.

1038
00:59:31,213 --> 00:59:32,916
You're too late.

1039
00:59:33,048 --> 00:59:34,216
This is the beginning
of the end.

1040
00:59:34,349 --> 00:59:37,252
Or the end of the end.

1041
00:59:37,386 --> 00:59:40,122
Or maybe it's the end
of the beginning?

1042
00:59:42,090 --> 00:59:45,961
Eat lava, monkey boy!

1043
00:59:50,098 --> 00:59:51,667
My bacon is baking.

1044
00:59:51,800 --> 00:59:53,869
I hope it's true
that girls like fried bananas.

1045
00:59:54,002 --> 00:59:56,071
Do you think this is
covered in Goola's health plan?

1046
00:59:56,205 --> 00:59:57,973
Are you kidding? No way.

1047
00:59:58,106 --> 00:59:59,575
I know. I wrote it.

1048
00:59:59,708 --> 01:00:01,076
Hey! We're steering it!

1049
01:00:01,210 --> 01:00:04,213
Other way, other way.
No. Yes.

1050
01:00:04,346 --> 01:00:06,381
- No.
- Sir.

1051
01:00:06,515 --> 01:00:08,183
They are heading for the lava!

1052
01:00:08,317 --> 01:00:09,818
- Right, go right.
- Go right.

1053
01:00:09,953 --> 01:00:11,086
- My left.
- Go left?

1054
01:00:11,220 --> 01:00:12,788
- Right!
- Oh, no!

1055
01:00:12,922 --> 01:00:14,556
Cheek, jump!

1056
01:00:16,625 --> 01:00:18,260
Whee!

1057
01:00:18,393 --> 01:00:20,629
- I said left.
- You said right!

1058
01:00:24,233 --> 01:00:26,034
Peanut!

1059
01:00:27,269 --> 01:00:29,137
You got any marshmallows?

1060
01:00:30,439 --> 01:00:32,341
Going up.

1061
01:00:32,474 --> 01:00:35,711
I know these machines better
than anyone.

1062
01:00:39,848 --> 01:00:41,149
Next floor lingerie,

1063
01:00:41,283 --> 01:00:43,619
sporting goods,
and deadly lava balls.

1064
01:00:45,721 --> 01:00:47,122
Looks like we're having
a special run

1065
01:00:47,256 --> 01:00:49,157
on those lava balls.

1066
01:00:51,995 --> 01:00:53,662
Oh, fruit! No!

1067
01:00:53,795 --> 01:00:57,499
Buddy, I said, we make it
thick so it'll stick.

1068
01:00:58,534 --> 01:00:59,568
Ow!

1069
01:00:59,701 --> 01:01:02,371
Oh.
Flying gets easier and easier.

1070
01:01:06,241 --> 01:01:07,911
- Partner?
- Partners.

1071
01:01:08,043 --> 01:01:09,645
Charge!

1072
01:01:09,778 --> 01:01:12,147
Now try and stop me.

1073
01:01:24,159 --> 01:01:25,561

This way.

1079
01:01:59,761 --> 01:02:00,964
It stopped!

1080
01:02:01,096 --> 01:02:03,565
Hooray!

1081
01:02:11,406 --> 01:02:14,876
- Oh, no.
- Oh please.

1082
01:02:19,247 --> 01:02:22,184
Well, you got to hand it
to the big chimp.

1083
01:02:23,052 --> 01:02:24,586
Nah.

1084
01:02:56,284 --> 01:02:58,854

1086
01:03:08,563 --> 01:03:10,198
Hey, what the fruit
are you doing?

1087
01:03:10,332 --> 01:03:12,567
- No problemo.
- Yes problemo.

1088
01:03:18,340 --> 01:03:20,175
Peanut!

1089
01:03:23,311 --> 01:03:24,546
They're okay.

1090
01:03:24,680 --> 01:03:27,683
That is one
lucky monkey.

1091
01:03:27,816 --> 01:03:32,220
- Nice work, pig.
- Why thank you, monkey.

1092
01:03:40,662 --> 01:03:42,431
Lookout!

1093
01:03:53,642 --> 01:03:58,847
Why you...!
This isn't finished!

1094
01:03:58,981 --> 01:04:00,749
You want to bet?

1095
01:04:03,785 --> 01:04:06,455
No!

1096
01:04:11,226 --> 01:04:12,794
He's in the juice now.

1097
01:04:12,929 --> 01:04:14,863
About time he got canned.

1098
01:04:16,398 --> 01:04:17,833
Now what?

1099
01:04:18,533 --> 01:04:19,835
Need a lift?

1100
01:04:19,969 --> 01:04:21,137
You came back.

1101
01:04:21,269 --> 01:04:22,905
What's the catch?

1102
01:04:25,540 --> 01:04:27,809
She's kind of sweet
on you.

1103
01:04:32,014 --> 01:04:34,316
Well, you can't blame her.

1104
01:04:34,449 --> 01:04:37,486
Not you, banana breath.
Him!

1105
01:04:39,122 --> 01:04:41,224
- Me?
- Him?

1106
01:04:41,356 --> 01:04:44,493
I like the strong,
silent type.

1107
01:04:46,896 --> 01:04:49,865
- Oh, I see.
- Still friends?

1108
01:05:09,986 --> 01:05:12,255
The nose knows.

1109
01:05:23,698 --> 01:05:26,468
Why?

1110
01:05:26,601 --> 01:05:29,671
I had enough
of playing second banana

1111
01:05:29,805 --> 01:05:32,909
to a bunch of
simple minded simians.

1112
01:05:33,042 --> 01:05:34,576
I'm sorry, old friend,

1113
01:05:34,709 --> 01:05:37,579
but I order you to further
service Goola City.

1114
01:05:37,712 --> 01:05:40,382
You will help restore it
to its former glory

1115
01:05:40,515 --> 01:05:43,286
by cleaning up the mess
you made.

1116
01:05:43,418 --> 01:05:45,554
You order me?

1117
01:05:48,690 --> 01:05:51,227
Uncle Moneke is a bad...

1118
01:05:58,633 --> 01:06:02,771
Congratulations to you all
for saving Goola City.

1119
01:06:02,905 --> 01:06:07,043
- Ah, about that.
- Yes, Peanut?

1120
01:06:07,176 --> 01:06:08,945
We can do better
than that.

1121
01:06:59,028 --> 01:07:02,397
Peanut, today, I am proud to be
a monkey's uncle.

1122
01:07:07,203 --> 01:07:09,871
Now this belongs to you.

1123
01:07:13,342 --> 01:07:15,710
Ooh! Gee.

1124
01:07:20,548 --> 01:07:23,219
Hey crybaby,
get back to work.

1125
01:07:23,352 --> 01:07:25,654
Uncle Moneke, what can I say?

1126
01:07:25,787 --> 01:07:28,723
I made a copy for myself
years ago.

1127
01:07:30,825 --> 01:07:32,827
Oh, you cheeky monkey.

1128
01:07:36,498 --> 01:07:38,234
<i>Not so long ago,</i>

1129
01:07:38,367 --> 01:07:41,870
<i>the beautiful island of Goola
began sinking into the sea</i>

1130
01:07:42,004 --> 01:07:44,539
<i>until a particularly
clever monkey</i>

1131
01:07:44,673 --> 01:07:47,575
<i>and his friends saved the day.</i>

1132
01:07:48,710 --> 01:07:50,745
Hold the fruit!

1133
01:07:50,880 --> 01:07:52,814
Aren't you
forgetting something?

1134
01:07:53,416 --> 01:07:55,051
That's more like it.

1135
01:08:01,390 --> 01:08:03,359
- Pardon me.
- Hey, buddy.

1136
01:08:03,491 --> 01:08:04,626
My buddy.

1137
01:08:04,759 --> 01:08:05,895
Mind if I cut in?

1138
01:08:06,028 --> 01:08:07,696
- Well...
- Of course.

1139
01:08:07,829 --> 01:08:09,332

01:10:35,244 --> 01:10:36,579
you've got to go pick
up pencils,

then you've got to pick up soap,

then we clean the bathrooms.
