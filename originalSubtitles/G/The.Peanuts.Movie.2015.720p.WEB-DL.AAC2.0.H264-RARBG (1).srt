2
00:01:39,124 --> 00:01:40,958
Beethoven.

3
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:44,126
Linus, time to get up.

4
00:01:44,128 --> 00:01:46,964
You don't want to be late for school.

5
00:01:46,966 --> 00:01:48,965
Get up!

6
00:01:48,967 --> 00:01:51,052
My blanket!

7
00:01:52,930 --> 00:01:54,595
Hello?

8
00:01:54,597 --> 00:01:55,973
Snow day?

9
00:01:55,975 --> 00:01:58,976
Snow day!

10
00:01:58,978 --> 00:02:01,102
No school today!

11
00:02:01,104 --> 00:02:03,813
Dreams do come true!

12
00:02:03,815 --> 00:02:05,900
No school!

13
00:02:09,570 --> 00:02:11,947
Franklin and Peppermint Patty
are on my team!

14
00:02:11,949 --> 00:02:13,073
I got my hockey stick!

15
00:02:13,075 --> 00:02:14,156
I got my skates!

16
00:02:14,158 --> 00:02:15,491
Who has the pucks?

17
00:02:15,493 --> 00:02:16,994
Looking sharp today, Pigpen.

18
00:02:16,996 --> 00:02:18,578
Sorry I'm late.

19
00:02:18,580 --> 00:02:20,121
What's taking him so long?

20
00:02:20,123 --> 00:02:22,873
Come on, Charlie Brown!

21
00:02:22,875 --> 00:02:26,003
No. Not quite. That's the one!

22
00:02:35,514 --> 00:02:37,014
I've got my kite!

23
00:02:37,016 --> 00:02:39,557
Today's the day. I can feel it!

24
00:02:39,559 --> 00:02:40,891
A kite? Today?

25
00:02:40,893 --> 00:02:42,436
In the middle of winter?

26
00:02:42,438 --> 00:02:43,603
Come on, guys!

27
00:02:43,605 --> 00:02:46,523
Only Charlie Brown.

28
00:02:46,525 --> 00:02:49,025
A new kite, a perfect breeze.

29
00:02:49,027 --> 00:02:50,901
It all feels just right.

30
00:02:50,903 --> 00:02:53,697
Now that the Kite-Eating Tree
is sleeping for the winter...

31
00:02:53,699 --> 00:02:55,534
we have nothing to fear.

32
00:02:57,619 --> 00:02:59,037
Lift off!

33
00:03:06,503 --> 00:03:07,543
Wait a minute.

34
00:03:07,545 --> 00:03:09,712
It's in the air. It's flying!

35
00:03:09,714 --> 00:03:10,631
Hey, guys!

36
00:03:10,633 --> 00:03:13,301
Look! Look, I did it!

37
00:03:20,016 --> 00:03:21,182
Hey, Charlie Brown.

38
00:03:21,184 --> 00:03:23,060
Still no luck, huh?

39
00:03:23,062 --> 00:03:27,229
Remember, it's the courage
to continue that counts!

40
00:03:27,231 --> 00:03:29,608
Runaway kite!

41
00:03:29,610 --> 00:03:31,153
Sorry!

42
00:03:34,782 --> 00:03:36,073
No brakes!

43
00:03:36,075 --> 00:03:39,241
And now, for my famous triple Axel!

44
00:03:39,243 --> 00:03:41,580
Prepare to be amazed!

45
00:03:43,081 --> 00:03:45,416
- A quadruple!
- Bravo!

46
00:03:50,505 --> 00:03:52,756
Stupid Kite-Eating Tree.

47
00:03:55,093 --> 00:03:57,259
Good grief.

48
00:03:57,261 --> 00:03:58,971
You blockhead!

49
00:03:58,973 --> 00:04:00,805
I should have known.

50
00:04:00,807 --> 00:04:05,644
What kind of a person tries to fly
a kite in the middle of winter?

51
00:04:05,646 --> 00:04:07,603
Don't you ever know when to give up?

52
00:04:07,605 --> 00:04:10,607
You will never get that kite to fly.

53
00:04:10,609 --> 00:04:15,029
Why? Because you're Charlie Brown!

54
00:04:19,868 --> 00:04:20,993
Thanks, Linus.

55
00:04:20,995 --> 00:04:22,285
Listen, Charlie Brown.

56
00:04:22,287 --> 00:04:26,957
Ignoring what my sister Lucy says
has enabled me to make it this far in life.

57
00:04:26,959 --> 00:04:30,253
What would I do
without a good friend like you?

58
00:04:35,217 --> 00:04:38,053
Aw, my Sweet Babboo!

59
00:04:39,221 --> 00:04:42,806
Isn't he the cutest thing?

60
00:04:42,808 --> 00:04:45,476
Careful, sir!

61
00:04:50,149 --> 00:04:52,359
Watch the curls!

62
00:05:19,053 --> 00:05:20,801
I don't care what Lucy says.

63
00:05:20,803 --> 00:05:23,638
I may have had troubles
in the past flying a kite...

64
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:25,931
and I may have never
won a baseball game...

65
00:05:25,933 --> 00:05:28,852
but it's not for the lack of trying.

66
00:05:28,854 --> 00:05:33,650
My pitching has to improve if I come
out here to my trusty mound every day.

67
00:05:37,154 --> 00:05:40,866
Charlie Brown is not a quitter.

68
00:05:49,666 --> 00:05:51,874
Bottom of the 9th. Two outs.

69
00:05:51,876 --> 00:05:55,671
A strike-out here
would make the pitcher an instant hero.

70
00:05:56,924 --> 00:06:00,469
It all comes down to this one pitch.

71
00:06:11,063 --> 00:06:13,729
Let's see if you can handle my fastball.

72
00:06:13,731 --> 00:06:15,898
Ol' Number One. The Heater.

73
00:06:15,900 --> 00:06:17,610
The Brown Bullet.

74
00:06:43,428 --> 00:06:46,847
It's going to be a long winter.

75
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:56,857
Someone's moving in
across the street from me?

76
00:06:56,859 --> 00:06:59,025
Hey, gang, look!
There's a new kid moving in!

77
00:06:59,027 --> 00:07:01,152
Big brother, pull yourself together!

78
00:07:01,154 --> 00:07:03,030
Come on, Charlie Brown!

79
00:07:03,032 --> 00:07:04,280
Get out of the way!

80
00:07:04,282 --> 00:07:05,157
Hey, guys.

81
00:07:05,159 --> 00:07:07,825
What do you see? Who is it?

82
00:07:07,827 --> 00:07:10,244
I think I see a piano!
I hope he loves Beethoven!

83
00:07:10,246 --> 00:07:12,039
Beethoven, Schmeethoven.

84
00:07:12,041 --> 00:07:15,292
Maybe he will appreciate
my natural beauty.

85
00:07:15,294 --> 00:07:16,751
Who cares about that?

86
00:07:16,753 --> 00:07:18,878
As long as he's a better goalie
than Marcie.

87
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:20,255
You're hurting me, sir.

88
00:07:20,257 --> 00:07:21,881
I'm sorry, but it's true.

89
00:07:21,883 --> 00:07:23,924
No, you're pulling on my hair!

90
00:07:23,926 --> 00:07:26,761
I just hope he'll have an open mind
about the Great Pumpkin.

91
00:07:26,763 --> 00:07:28,804
I think they have a toaster!

92
00:07:28,806 --> 00:07:31,933
I just hope this new kid
has never heard of me.

93
00:07:31,935 --> 00:07:36,145
He would know nothing
of my past imperfections.

94
00:07:36,147 --> 00:07:40,484
It's not often you get the opportunity
to start over with a clean slate.

95
00:07:40,486 --> 00:07:43,279
This time, things will be different.

96
00:07:50,746 --> 00:07:52,037
He did it!

97
00:08:02,007 --> 00:08:03,172
Snoopy...

98
00:08:03,174 --> 00:08:06,842
why is it that
everything I try turns out wrong?

99
00:08:06,844 --> 00:08:10,054
Sometimes I wonder
if the kids really like me.

100
00:08:10,056 --> 00:08:14,100
Maybe that new kid will see me
for who I really am, like you.

101
00:08:14,102 --> 00:08:17,479
A dog doesn't try
to give advice or judge you.

102
00:08:17,481 --> 00:08:20,064
They just love you for who you are.

103
00:08:20,066 --> 00:08:23,944
It's nice to have someone
that will just sit and listen to you.

104
00:08:28,366 --> 00:08:30,701
Man's best friend.

105
00:08:32,371 --> 00:08:34,245
You can't come to school, Snoopy.

106
00:08:34,247 --> 00:08:37,374
Now be a good dog and go home.

107
00:08:48,511 --> 00:08:50,722
No dogs allowed!

108
00:08:55,894 --> 00:08:57,268
I think I saw the new kid.

109
00:08:57,270 --> 00:08:59,021
Did you see that moving truck arrive?

110
00:08:59,023 --> 00:09:01,230
Who do you suppose it will be?

111
00:09:01,232 --> 00:09:03,899
The new kid is coming!

112
00:09:03,901 --> 00:09:05,067
That's not the new kid.

113
00:09:05,069 --> 00:09:07,071
Hey, Charlie Brown.

114
00:09:10,366 --> 00:09:12,533
Good morning, Linus.
What do you have there?

115
00:09:12,535 --> 00:09:14,536
It's my turn for show and tell today.

116
00:09:14,538 --> 00:09:17,748
This is the same plane
flown by Manfred von Richthofen.

117
00:09:17,750 --> 00:09:18,581
Who?

118
00:09:18,583 --> 00:09:22,418
The Red Baron. The most famous
aviator during The Great War.

119
00:09:22,420 --> 00:09:24,004
It's not real, is it?

120
00:09:30,261 --> 00:09:32,555
My naturally curly hair!

121
00:09:36,601 --> 00:09:38,937
Duck, Linus!

122
00:09:44,193 --> 00:09:46,944
Yes, Miss Othmar.

123
00:09:49,615 --> 00:09:51,447
Sir?

124
00:09:51,449 --> 00:09:53,282
Sir.

125
00:09:53,284 --> 00:09:54,868
Sir!

126
00:09:54,870 --> 00:09:56,452
Two! No, three!

127
00:09:56,454 --> 00:09:57,620
Was I close?

128
00:09:57,622 --> 00:10:00,458
Class hasn't started yet, sir.

129
00:10:01,961 --> 00:10:04,962
What? The new kid is joining our class.

130
00:10:10,343 --> 00:10:12,886
She doesn't look like a goalie to me.

131
00:10:12,888 --> 00:10:14,345
Wow! She's pretty.

132
00:10:14,347 --> 00:10:16,683
She's not that pretty.

133
00:10:20,980 --> 00:10:24,691
Linus. She looked at me!

134
00:10:33,449 --> 00:10:36,493
Not the yearly
standardized test again!

135
00:10:36,495 --> 00:10:40,832
Ma'am, will this test accurately reflect
the knowledge we have gained here?

136
00:10:41,917 --> 00:10:45,585
Is it fair we, at this young age...

137
00:10:45,587 --> 00:10:47,172
Yes, ma'am.

138
00:10:52,678 --> 00:10:54,344
Thanks.

139
00:10:54,346 --> 00:10:58,183
Question 1.
"If you had 6 red tomatoes and..."

140
00:10:59,268 --> 00:11:01,101
Red.

141
00:11:11,529 --> 00:11:13,529
Come on, focus.

142
00:11:13,531 --> 00:11:16,158
First impressions are everything.

143
00:11:42,019 --> 00:11:44,062
No dogs!

144
00:11:58,327 --> 00:11:59,743
Already done?

145
00:11:59,745 --> 00:12:02,038
She must be smart.

146
00:12:13,299 --> 00:12:16,593
It's got teeth marks.

147
00:12:16,595 --> 00:12:19,053
She nibbles on her pencil like I do.

148
00:12:19,055 --> 00:12:22,014
We have something in common!

149
00:12:22,016 --> 00:12:23,601
One minute left?

150
00:12:31,110 --> 00:12:32,778
Out of my way, Chuck!

151
00:12:34,487 --> 00:12:36,989
Write our names? Yes, ma'am.

152
00:12:39,451 --> 00:12:42,326
Chuck, are you trying to hold my hand?

153
00:12:42,328 --> 00:12:44,580
You sly dog.

154
00:12:46,207 --> 00:12:48,624
Hi, I'm Brown Charlie.

155
00:12:48,626 --> 00:12:50,460
I mean, "Barnie Clown."

156
00:12:50,462 --> 00:12:51,880
I mean...

157
00:12:56,635 --> 00:12:59,386
What are you in for?

158
00:12:59,388 --> 00:13:02,974
Have you ever had that feeling
when you can't stop smiling?

159
00:13:04,101 --> 00:13:06,643
Your heart pounds inside your chest?

160
00:13:06,645 --> 00:13:10,604
You try to stand
but your knees become weak?

161
00:13:10,606 --> 00:13:14,734
And then that Little Red-Haired Girl
glances at you.

162
00:13:14,736 --> 00:13:19,531
And all of life's possibilities
become so clear.

163
00:13:19,533 --> 00:13:22,283
And then you realize...

164
00:13:22,285 --> 00:13:26,204
she has no idea you're alive.

165
00:13:26,206 --> 00:13:28,415
Why am I here?

166
00:13:28,417 --> 00:13:32,295
Because I just came down
with a serious case of inadequacy.

167
00:14:33,481 --> 00:14:34,898
Here she comes.

168
00:14:34,900 --> 00:14:37,193
This is my chance
to make a good impression.

169
00:14:41,615 --> 00:14:43,866
Maybe tomorrow.

170
00:15:24,283 --> 00:15:27,744
It was a dark and stormy night.

171
00:15:29,954 --> 00:15:32,413
High above the French countryside...

172
00:15:32,415 --> 00:15:36,792
the World War I Flying Ace
had never been so close...

173
00:15:36,794 --> 00:15:38,295
to his lifelong enemy...

174
00:15:38,297 --> 00:15:40,924
the infamous Red Baron.

175
00:17:03,966 --> 00:17:06,882
The key is keeping a low profile.

176
00:17:06,884 --> 00:17:09,386
For now, we just keep our distance.

177
00:17:14,059 --> 00:17:16,017
Snoopy!

178
00:17:16,019 --> 00:17:17,853
No!

179
00:17:21,483 --> 00:17:24,027
That was a close one.

180
00:17:31,409 --> 00:17:34,744
If I could only work up the nerve
to go over there, I'd...

181
00:17:34,746 --> 00:17:36,538
What are you looking at, big brother?

182
00:17:36,540 --> 00:17:38,125
Are you crazy?

183
00:17:41,544 --> 00:17:43,921
You're in love!

184
00:17:53,681 --> 00:17:59,145
Chapter 1.
It was the greatest love story ever told.

185
00:18:32,137 --> 00:18:34,972
Her name was Fifi.

186
00:18:34,974 --> 00:18:39,311
She was the most beautiful thing
he had ever seen.

187
00:20:08,566 --> 00:20:12,485
I can't believe I'm about to talk
to the Little Red-Haired Girl.

188
00:20:12,487 --> 00:20:16,323
It's moments like this
when you need your faithful friend.

189
00:20:23,666 --> 00:20:24,747
Yep.

190
00:20:24,749 --> 00:20:28,209
If there's one person you want by your side
at a moment like this...

191
00:20:28,211 --> 00:20:30,588
it's your loyal dog.

192
00:20:46,271 --> 00:20:47,812
Hello?

193
00:20:47,814 --> 00:20:49,607
Hello?

194
00:20:52,111 --> 00:20:53,778
She said, "Hello"!

195
00:21:01,286 --> 00:21:03,203
Charlie Brown!

196
00:21:03,205 --> 00:21:06,831
What brings you out here
so late in the day?

197
00:21:06,833 --> 00:21:09,126
I need your advice on girls, Lucy.

198
00:21:09,128 --> 00:21:10,711
You're a girl, right?

199
00:21:10,713 --> 00:21:13,629
Let's just say there's this girl
I'd like to impress.

200
00:21:13,631 --> 00:21:16,132
But she's something and I'm nothing.

201
00:21:16,134 --> 00:21:19,677
If I were something and she was nothing,
I could talk to her.

202
00:21:19,679 --> 00:21:22,848
Or, if she was nothing and I was nothing,
I could talk to her.

203
00:21:22,850 --> 00:21:28,020
But she's something and I'm nothing,
so I just can't talk to her.

204
00:21:28,022 --> 00:21:31,982
You're being ridiculous, Charlie Brown.
Why, you have much to offer.

205
00:21:31,984 --> 00:21:35,234
She has a pretty face
and pretty faces make me nervous.

206
00:21:35,236 --> 00:21:38,030
Pretty face? Pretty face?

207
00:21:38,032 --> 00:21:39,615
I have a pretty face!

208
00:21:39,617 --> 00:21:41,867
How come my face
doesn't make you nervous?

209
00:21:41,869 --> 00:21:45,080
How come you can talk to me,
Charlie Brown?

210
00:21:47,999 --> 00:21:51,917
I just need to know the secret
to winning her heart.

211
00:21:51,919 --> 00:21:54,795
Look into this mirror, Charlie Brown.

212
00:21:54,797 --> 00:21:59,342
This is the face of failure.
A classic failure face.

213
00:21:59,344 --> 00:22:01,802
Do you think girls like failures,
Charlie Brown?

214
00:22:01,804 --> 00:22:03,013
Well, no.

215
00:22:03,015 --> 00:22:05,349
Girls want someone with proven success.

216
00:22:05,351 --> 00:22:07,184
Have you won any awards?

217
00:22:07,186 --> 00:22:11,855
Like a Congressional Medal of Honor?
Or a Nobel Peace Prize?

218
00:22:11,857 --> 00:22:16,275
What are your real estate holdings?
Do you have a diversified portfolio?

219
00:22:16,277 --> 00:22:19,696
Let me let you in on a little secret,
Charlie Brown.

220
00:22:19,698 --> 00:22:24,784
If you really want to impress girls,
you need to show them you're a winner.

221
00:22:24,786 --> 00:22:26,369
A winner? Me?

222
00:22:26,371 --> 00:22:29,039
Lucy, you may be on to something.

223
00:22:29,041 --> 00:22:33,837
Of course, when I say "you,"
you know I don't mean you personally.

224
00:22:36,715 --> 00:22:38,884
That will be five cents, please.

225
00:22:43,221 --> 00:22:47,724
Nickels, nickels, nickels.
What a beautiful sound.

226
00:22:47,726 --> 00:22:51,352
"Congratulations. You're now
on your way to becoming a winner."

227
00:22:51,354 --> 00:22:56,399
"Step 1. Forget everything
you ever knew about yourself."

228
00:22:56,401 --> 00:22:58,859
Okay. "Step 2."

229
00:22:58,861 --> 00:23:00,861
"Project confidence."

230
00:23:00,863 --> 00:23:02,698
"Don't slouch."

231
00:23:05,076 --> 00:23:08,704
"Maintain eye contact at all times."

232
00:23:24,888 --> 00:23:28,432
Yeehaw!

233
00:23:28,434 --> 00:23:30,141
Giddy-up, little pony!

234
00:23:30,143 --> 00:23:32,226
Yeehaw!

235
00:23:32,228 --> 00:23:33,436
What are you doing?

236
00:23:33,438 --> 00:23:37,148
I'm going to be a rodeo star
in the big talent show.

237
00:23:37,150 --> 00:23:39,443
When I win that first-prize ribbon...

238
00:23:39,445 --> 00:23:41,360
there will be no one
who hasn't heard the name...

239
00:23:41,362 --> 00:23:45,282
Sally Brown
and her trusty horse, Broomstick!

240
00:23:45,284 --> 00:23:49,119
Win the talent show.
Now that's a great idea.

241
00:23:49,121 --> 00:23:52,248
This is just what Lucy
was talking about.

242
00:24:08,724 --> 00:24:10,350
Ta-da!

243
00:24:33,415 --> 00:24:35,292
We're ready.

244
00:24:51,225 --> 00:24:52,849
Look at that.

245
00:24:52,851 --> 00:24:54,977
Is that Charlie Brown?

246
00:25:05,531 --> 00:25:07,030
She's here.

247
00:25:07,032 --> 00:25:11,451
I have a really good feeling that tonight
she will see the new Charlie Brown.

248
00:25:11,453 --> 00:25:16,372
Charlie Brown? As your psychiatrist,
I'm surprised to see you here.

249
00:25:16,374 --> 00:25:21,086
A person with all your insecurities
normally wouldn't enter a talent show.

250
00:25:21,088 --> 00:25:23,879
I'm...

251
00:25:23,881 --> 00:25:27,259
I ought to slug you!

252
00:25:27,261 --> 00:25:30,928
I've been kissed by a dog!
I have dog germs!

253
00:25:30,930 --> 00:25:35,016
Get hot water! Get some disinfectant!
Get some iodine!

254
00:25:35,018 --> 00:25:37,978
Let's keep this thing moving.
Time's a-wasting.

255
00:25:43,569 --> 00:25:45,276
Thank you!

256
00:25:45,278 --> 00:25:47,530
Break a leg, Chuck!

257
00:25:48,823 --> 00:25:52,033
Treat your assistant kindly, Charles.

258
00:25:52,035 --> 00:25:55,996
Okay, Sally, we're running behind,
so gallop, don't trot!

259
00:25:58,124 --> 00:26:00,919
Save the applause
for the end, everyone.

260
00:26:02,254 --> 00:26:05,423
If you like this, wait for the encore!

261
00:26:08,177 --> 00:26:11,386
Your sister is really dying out there.

262
00:26:11,388 --> 00:26:14,432
Hey, that's not a real horse!

263
00:26:19,063 --> 00:26:22,063
Sorry, Charlie Brown.
This has gone on long enough.

264
00:26:22,065 --> 00:26:23,314
Drop the curtain!

265
00:26:23,316 --> 00:26:25,943
Don't do that.
She said she has a big finish.

266
00:26:25,945 --> 00:26:29,948
Well, it's either your act or hers.
We can't hold forever.

267
00:26:40,626 --> 00:26:42,919
Change of plans, Snoopy.

268
00:26:53,054 --> 00:26:55,304
Big brother?

269
00:26:55,306 --> 00:26:57,474
Rope me.

270
00:26:57,476 --> 00:26:59,436
That's not a real cow.

271
00:27:04,565 --> 00:27:06,735
I'm gonna get you!

272
00:27:18,663 --> 00:27:19,996
Sorry, sir.

273
00:27:19,998 --> 00:27:21,122
Good one.

274
00:27:21,124 --> 00:27:23,000
Oh, Schroeder...

275
00:27:28,340 --> 00:27:32,511
You can run, little dogie,
but you can't hide!

276
00:27:36,265 --> 00:27:38,850
This is going great!

277
00:27:40,018 --> 00:27:43,145
My name is Calamity Sally...

278
00:27:43,147 --> 00:27:48,025
the best bronc-busting,
lasso-roping cowgirl in this here town!

279
00:27:53,407 --> 00:27:55,033
Thanks, big brother.

280
00:28:02,541 --> 00:28:04,499
"Moo"?

281
00:28:04,501 --> 00:28:07,754
Nobody reads the school paper anyhow.

282
00:28:11,216 --> 00:28:16,261
Look on the bright side, Charlie Brown. They
say there's no such thing as bad publicity.

283
00:28:16,263 --> 00:28:20,475
You're right, Linus.
She definitely knows who I am now.

284
00:28:23,394 --> 00:28:26,312
You know, Charlie Brown,
if you like her so much...

285
00:28:26,314 --> 00:28:29,398
why not just walk up to her
and introduce yourself?

286
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:32,653
After the complete fool
I made out of myself last night?

287
00:28:32,655 --> 00:28:36,658
Yeah, and why don't I just
fly to the moon?

288
00:28:39,285 --> 00:28:42,411
Oh, brother. She's talking to them?

289
00:28:42,413 --> 00:28:45,331
So much for a fresh start.

290
00:28:45,333 --> 00:28:48,334
Time is running out.

291
00:28:48,336 --> 00:28:49,586
"Number 6."

292
00:28:49,588 --> 00:28:52,755
"Tell yourself,
'I am worthy. I can do this."

293
00:28:52,757 --> 00:28:54,757
"'I have what it takes.'"

294
00:28:54,759 --> 00:28:56,552
Hello?

295
00:28:57,720 --> 00:29:00,973
Your girlfriend's on the phone.

296
00:29:04,061 --> 00:29:05,310
- Hello?
- Hey, Chuck.

297
00:29:05,312 --> 00:29:06,477
This is Peppermint Patty.

298
00:29:06,479 --> 00:29:08,230
- How have you been?
- Well, I...

299
00:29:08,232 --> 00:29:10,607
Listen, I have some great news
for you, Chuck.

300
00:29:10,609 --> 00:29:12,442
The Winter Dance is in a few weeks...

301
00:29:12,444 --> 00:29:15,028
and I'm saving a dance for you.

302
00:29:15,030 --> 00:29:18,490
Anyway, Marcie put me in charge
of the refreshment committee.

303
00:29:18,492 --> 00:29:21,784
I took it upon myself and signed you up
to make the cupcakes.

304
00:29:21,786 --> 00:29:24,579
You did what? I can't cook cupcakes.

305
00:29:24,581 --> 00:29:27,291
The only thing I do know
how to make is toast.

306
00:29:27,293 --> 00:29:30,209
Besides, why would I even want
to go to the Winter Dance?

307
00:29:30,211 --> 00:29:32,628
Toast and cupcakes!
That sounds good, Chuck.

308
00:29:32,630 --> 00:29:33,754
See you there.

309
00:29:33,756 --> 00:29:35,590
Hold on. I said...

310
00:29:35,592 --> 00:29:38,136
Hello? Hello?

311
00:29:40,764 --> 00:29:42,265
Rats.

312
00:30:13,546 --> 00:30:15,798
Hey! What's going on?

313
00:30:17,133 --> 00:30:18,257
Turn it down!

314
00:30:18,259 --> 00:30:20,136
Turn it down in there!

315
00:30:24,307 --> 00:30:26,350
She likes to dance.

316
00:31:15,234 --> 00:31:18,734
One, two, three, four.

317
00:31:18,736 --> 00:31:22,155
One, two, three, four.

318
00:31:22,157 --> 00:31:24,741
One, two, three, four.

319
00:31:24,743 --> 00:31:26,743
One, two, three, four.

320
00:31:26,745 --> 00:31:28,869
One, two, three, four.

321
00:31:28,871 --> 00:31:31,792
One, two, three, four.

322
00:31:35,920 --> 00:31:38,254
I could really use a dance partner.

323
00:31:38,256 --> 00:31:39,630
Good luck with that.

324
00:31:39,632 --> 00:31:41,925
One, two, three, four.

325
00:31:41,927 --> 00:31:44,636
Okay, Snoopy, I got the basics down.

326
00:31:44,638 --> 00:31:47,849
But if I'm going to win,
I need to step it up.

327
00:31:50,436 --> 00:31:52,644
One, two, three, four.

328
00:31:52,646 --> 00:31:54,478
One, two, three, four.

329
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:56,775
I can see it now.

330
00:32:03,615 --> 00:32:05,782
We have our winners!

331
00:32:05,784 --> 00:32:11,872
Let us applaud them as they begin
the traditional dance of the champions!

332
00:32:19,965 --> 00:32:22,424
Snoopy!

333
00:32:22,426 --> 00:32:26,637
Thanks for the help.
I left some cookies in your dog dish.

334
00:32:26,639 --> 00:32:30,432
One, two, three, four.

335
00:32:30,434 --> 00:32:32,476
One, two, three...

336
00:32:41,445 --> 00:32:44,696
You know, I've always wanted
to dance with Pigpen.

337
00:32:44,698 --> 00:32:46,073
Yuck!

338
00:32:48,369 --> 00:32:52,746
Why isn't anyone dancing?
It's called a dance.

339
00:32:54,999 --> 00:32:57,292
- Oh, Sweet Babboo!
- Oh, no, here she comes!

340
00:32:57,294 --> 00:33:00,964
- Someone needs to get this dance started.
- No!

341
00:33:19,608 --> 00:33:24,319
These cupcakes don't look half bad,
if I do say so myself.

342
00:33:24,321 --> 00:33:27,488
This time I've come totally prepared.

343
00:33:27,490 --> 00:33:29,616
I couldn't have done it without you.

344
00:33:29,618 --> 00:33:34,121
The old Charlie Brown would still
be lying in bed with a stomachache.

345
00:33:38,877 --> 00:33:41,004
Good grief.

346
00:33:46,759 --> 00:33:50,762
Marcie, look! Everyone's here!

347
00:33:50,764 --> 00:33:53,389
Let me help you with that, Marcie.

348
00:33:53,391 --> 00:33:55,851
Such a gentleman, Charles.

349
00:33:57,896 --> 00:34:00,023
She's here.

350
00:34:03,401 --> 00:34:04,650
Okay, ladies.

351
00:34:04,652 --> 00:34:07,070
It's time for you to show off
your best move.

352
00:34:07,072 --> 00:34:10,615
Which one of you will win the first half
of our dance competition...

353
00:34:10,617 --> 00:34:12,533
and take home the trophy?

354
00:34:12,535 --> 00:34:14,494
Let them hear it!

355
00:34:14,496 --> 00:34:16,539
Nice moves.

356
00:34:21,794 --> 00:34:23,544
Listen to that noise!

357
00:34:23,546 --> 00:34:26,923
I think it's safe to say
we know who our winner is!

358
00:34:26,925 --> 00:34:27,758
She won.

359
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:29,635
And now, it's the gentlemen's turn...

360
00:34:29,637 --> 00:34:32,387
to see who will be joining
our lovely winning lady...

361
00:34:32,389 --> 00:34:34,097
for the final dance of the night.

362
00:34:34,099 --> 00:34:35,474
I got to get out there.

363
00:34:35,476 --> 00:34:39,436
Are you guys ready?
Then here we go!

364
00:34:53,952 --> 00:34:55,327
This is it.

365
00:34:56,454 --> 00:34:58,331
It's now or never.

366
00:35:09,635 --> 00:35:14,720
Check out the moves on that
funny-looking kid with the big nose!

367
00:35:14,722 --> 00:35:17,349
Yeah! All right!

368
00:35:28,153 --> 00:35:32,365
Okay, just like you practiced.
Remember the steps.

369
00:35:33,450 --> 00:35:36,117
One, two, three, four.

370
00:35:36,119 --> 00:35:38,496
One, two, three...

371
00:35:45,169 --> 00:35:46,503
Charlie Brown?

372
00:35:46,505 --> 00:35:47,798
All right!

373
00:35:48,965 --> 00:35:51,758
It looks like we may have a winner here!

374
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:53,175
It's going to happen.

375
00:35:53,177 --> 00:35:55,679
I'm about to dance
with the Little Red-Haired Girl.

376
00:36:03,896 --> 00:36:06,273
Let's get out of here!

377
00:36:08,735 --> 00:36:10,361
Do I know you?

378
00:36:12,740 --> 00:36:15,200
Wait! It's not over yet.

379
00:36:20,122 --> 00:36:22,040
Thanks, buddy.

380
00:36:25,168 --> 00:36:27,126
I hate to say it, Snoopy...

381
00:36:27,128 --> 00:36:31,967
it seems like the harder I try,
the further away she gets.

382
00:36:45,021 --> 00:36:47,939
The Flying Ace took to the skies.

383
00:36:47,941 --> 00:36:52,570
He searched endlessly for the girl
who had stolen his heart.

384
00:39:06,079 --> 00:39:08,789
Daydreaming will not make her materialize,
Charlie Brown.

385
00:39:08,791 --> 00:39:09,830
She's not here.

386
00:39:09,832 --> 00:39:11,207
Daydreaming? Me?

387
00:39:11,209 --> 00:39:12,792
She'll be back on Monday.

388
00:39:12,794 --> 00:39:16,213
I heard she went back east to take care
of her grandmother, who isn't feeling well.

389
00:39:16,215 --> 00:39:19,675
She seems like the kind of person
who would do that sort of thing.

390
00:39:21,095 --> 00:39:23,762
Not another book report!

391
00:39:23,764 --> 00:39:25,638
Time to pick our partners.

392
00:39:25,640 --> 00:39:27,975
No boys. No boys.

393
00:39:27,977 --> 00:39:29,767
Please...

394
00:39:29,769 --> 00:39:31,061
Patty! Yes!

395
00:39:31,063 --> 00:39:33,104
All right!

396
00:39:33,106 --> 00:39:34,690
Nope.

397
00:39:36,110 --> 00:39:37,611
Yes.

398
00:39:38,820 --> 00:39:40,403
Schroeder!

399
00:39:40,405 --> 00:39:44,742
There's no denying it.
It was written in the cards.

400
00:39:59,883 --> 00:40:03,093
The Little Red-Haired Girl.
My lucky day!

401
00:40:03,095 --> 00:40:06,847
This changes everything.
She will see the new me.

402
00:40:06,849 --> 00:40:09,265
And together we will win the gold star!

403
00:40:09,267 --> 00:40:11,434
After that, anything is possible!

404
00:40:11,436 --> 00:40:13,894
We could be the first kids
to land on the moon!

405
00:40:13,896 --> 00:40:15,896
One small step for kids...

406
00:40:15,898 --> 00:40:18,609
one giant leap for Charlie Brown.

407
00:40:21,822 --> 00:40:23,363
You've got to help me, Linus.

408
00:40:23,365 --> 00:40:26,950
I'm not sure I can handle being partners
with the Little Red-Haired Girl.

409
00:40:26,952 --> 00:40:28,785
I need to slow things down.

410
00:40:28,787 --> 00:40:31,370
Maybe I'm not ready
for a serious relationship.

411
00:40:31,372 --> 00:40:33,039
How will I support her?

412
00:40:33,041 --> 00:40:36,251
I can't afford a mortgage.
What if I'm put into escrow?

413
00:40:36,253 --> 00:40:39,421
Charlie Brown, you're being ridiculous.

414
00:40:39,423 --> 00:40:42,716
You're the only person I know
who can turn a simple book report...

415
00:40:42,718 --> 00:40:44,468
into a lifelong commitment.

416
00:40:44,470 --> 00:40:47,470
I've never been responsible
for anything before.

417
00:40:47,472 --> 00:40:50,976
This could be the worst thing
that's ever happened to her!

418
00:40:54,313 --> 00:40:56,312
Linus, it just hit me.

419
00:40:56,314 --> 00:40:58,731
I think I know how to become her hero.

420
00:40:58,733 --> 00:41:01,068
While she's away taking care
of her grandmother...

421
00:41:01,070 --> 00:41:04,153
I could complete the book report
for the two of us.

422
00:41:04,155 --> 00:41:08,242
That's one way to go,
but if you want my advice...

423
00:41:09,954 --> 00:41:13,412
They're posting the test scores.
Come on.

424
00:41:13,414 --> 00:41:16,207
Look. Someone got a perfect score, sir.

425
00:41:16,209 --> 00:41:19,336
You would have to be a genius
to get a perfect score.

426
00:41:19,338 --> 00:41:21,338
- I didn't know that was even possible.
- It's him!

427
00:41:21,340 --> 00:41:22,213
Here he comes!

428
00:41:22,215 --> 00:41:24,842
No one in the world
has ever gotten 100 before.

429
00:41:31,517 --> 00:41:33,057
A perfect score?

430
00:41:33,059 --> 00:41:35,977
Me? This can't be right.

431
00:41:35,979 --> 00:41:40,064
No, Charlie Brown, look.
You really do have a perfect score.

432
00:41:40,066 --> 00:41:42,818
I have heard peanut butter
is brain food.

433
00:41:42,820 --> 00:41:44,236
Nice job, Chuck, old boy.

434
00:41:44,238 --> 00:41:46,488
I always knew
you had it in you, Charles.

435
00:41:46,490 --> 00:41:47,948
This can't be right!

436
00:41:47,950 --> 00:41:49,448
Out of my way!

437
00:41:49,450 --> 00:41:51,910
Mr. Perfect, Charlie Brown?

438
00:41:51,912 --> 00:41:53,245
It must be a typo!

439
00:41:53,247 --> 00:41:55,872
I don't believe it.
I won't believe it!

440
00:41:55,874 --> 00:41:57,541
I demand a recount!

441
00:41:57,543 --> 00:41:59,334
Good afternoon, students and staff.

442
00:41:59,336 --> 00:42:00,876
We have a special announcement.

443
00:42:00,878 --> 00:42:03,129
There will be an all-school assembly
Monday morning...

444
00:42:03,131 --> 00:42:06,550
to celebrate our illustrious classmate,
Charlie Brown...

445
00:42:06,552 --> 00:42:09,885
who achieved a perfect score
on the standardized test.

446
00:42:09,887 --> 00:42:12,555
Make way. Genius coming through!

447
00:42:12,557 --> 00:42:15,392
I have a science project due next week.
Can you give me your thoughts?

448
00:42:15,394 --> 00:42:17,102
Hey, I saw him first!

449
00:42:17,104 --> 00:42:20,271
They say you're a genius.
Can you read my mind?

450
00:42:20,273 --> 00:42:21,523
Hey, leave him alone!

451
00:42:21,525 --> 00:42:23,274
Yeah, leave him alone!

452
00:42:23,276 --> 00:42:28,155
Now, Charlie Brown, as far as the book
report goes, what would you suggest?

453
00:42:28,157 --> 00:42:31,283
Well, you can never go wrong
if you stick with the classics.

454
00:42:31,285 --> 00:42:34,410
A comic book? I thought classics
had to have hard covers.

455
00:42:34,412 --> 00:42:37,623
Boy, do we feel stupid now.

456
00:42:41,128 --> 00:42:44,379
Will you look at this.
What a contemporary piece.

457
00:42:44,381 --> 00:42:46,923
Notice his use of space.

458
00:42:46,925 --> 00:42:49,593
Have you all lost your minds?

459
00:42:53,057 --> 00:42:54,558
Wow.

460
00:42:56,934 --> 00:43:00,563
You have what is referred
to as an "irrational fear."

461
00:43:01,606 --> 00:43:04,024
Hey, kid!
What do you think you're doing?

462
00:43:04,026 --> 00:43:06,859
Following in the footsteps of greatness.

463
00:43:06,861 --> 00:43:08,028
Breakaway!

464
00:43:08,030 --> 00:43:09,906
Shoot it, Charlie Brown! Shoot it!

465
00:43:14,954 --> 00:43:17,287
Nice use of angles there, Charles.

466
00:43:17,289 --> 00:43:20,207
All right, Charlie Brown!

467
00:43:20,209 --> 00:43:23,962
But how is Santa ever going to
find our house without lights?

468
00:43:28,467 --> 00:43:30,968
And this is where it all began.

469
00:43:30,970 --> 00:43:34,095
As a youth, he passed many hours
just sitting in that chair...

470
00:43:34,097 --> 00:43:36,305
keeping his deep thoughts to himself.

471
00:43:36,307 --> 00:43:40,434
And here we have his early kites,
used in many aerodynamic studies.

472
00:43:40,436 --> 00:43:41,477
Wow.

473
00:43:41,479 --> 00:43:45,148
If we're lucky,
we'll see him in his natural habitat.

474
00:43:45,150 --> 00:43:49,945
And this is his actual bed where he lies
and ponders life's greatest questions.

475
00:43:49,947 --> 00:43:51,655
Hey! What are you doing?

476
00:43:51,657 --> 00:43:54,159
I'm cashing in on your celebrity.

477
00:43:59,372 --> 00:44:01,582
Can I have your autograph?

478
00:44:02,626 --> 00:44:05,334
And for show and tell today...

479
00:44:05,336 --> 00:44:07,630
...my big brother!

480
00:44:22,271 --> 00:44:24,021
I haven't seen you in a while.

481
00:44:24,023 --> 00:44:25,981
My whole life has changed, Linus.

482
00:44:25,983 --> 00:44:28,191
All of a sudden,
everyone wants to be my friend...

483
00:44:28,193 --> 00:44:30,151
and yet, I haven't really changed.

484
00:44:30,153 --> 00:44:33,113
Do they like me for who I am,
or for who they think I am?

485
00:44:33,115 --> 00:44:35,532
There he is! Charlie Brown,
I need you on my chess team!

486
00:44:35,534 --> 00:44:38,117
He's got no time for meaningless games.
He's coming with me.

487
00:44:38,119 --> 00:44:39,244
Roll sound!

488
00:44:39,246 --> 00:44:41,412
- Speed.
- And, action!

489
00:44:41,414 --> 00:44:44,666
Do you have time to help me write
my book report? It's due on Monday.

490
00:44:44,668 --> 00:44:47,169
Monday? The report is due on Monday?

491
00:44:47,171 --> 00:44:50,296
She's back on Monday!
I haven't even started yet!

492
00:44:50,298 --> 00:44:52,298
Does anyone know where Marcie is?

493
00:44:52,300 --> 00:44:54,635
She went skating with Peppermint Patty.

494
00:44:54,637 --> 00:44:56,720
Mr. Brown. Mr. Brown!

495
00:44:56,722 --> 00:44:59,263
What about my exclusive?

496
00:44:59,265 --> 00:45:00,557
Cut.

497
00:45:00,559 --> 00:45:03,059
There's Huckleberry Finn...

498
00:45:03,061 --> 00:45:04,436
Catcher in the Rye.

499
00:45:04,438 --> 00:45:07,731
Sir, I've been sitting here for hours.

500
00:45:07,733 --> 00:45:11,693
These are the greatest books of all time.
Please just pick one!

501
00:45:11,695 --> 00:45:13,695
Let me sleep on it, Marcie.

502
00:45:13,697 --> 00:45:17,242
There's no time for sleeping, sir.
It's due Monday.

503
00:45:20,329 --> 00:45:25,082
Just my luck to get a partner
that thinks Moby Dick was a hockey player.

504
00:45:25,084 --> 00:45:28,044
Marcie? Where are you going?

505
00:45:29,588 --> 00:45:31,754
Hey, Chuck, old boy.

506
00:45:31,756 --> 00:45:33,590
What brings you down here?

507
00:45:33,592 --> 00:45:35,718
I'm looking for Marcie.

508
00:45:38,137 --> 00:45:39,428
I need some advice.

509
00:45:39,430 --> 00:45:44,017
Curveball not working for you?
Slap shot not strong enough?

510
00:45:44,019 --> 00:45:46,227
No, I'm good with all that.

511
00:45:46,229 --> 00:45:50,314
I need to talk to Marcie about
finding the greatest book of all time.

512
00:45:50,316 --> 00:45:53,109
I just might be able
to help you there, Chuck.

513
00:45:53,111 --> 00:45:56,613
Marcie just read up
a long list of great novels.

514
00:45:56,615 --> 00:45:59,365
Huckleberry-something,
Catcher with a Pie.

515
00:45:59,367 --> 00:46:03,495
But, she said the greatest book
of all time...

516
00:46:03,497 --> 00:46:05,789
is called Leo's Toy Store...

517
00:46:05,791 --> 00:46:10,376
by some old guy called Warren... Piece.

518
00:46:10,378 --> 00:46:11,628
Leo's Toy Store.

519
00:46:11,630 --> 00:46:13,379
Yup. That's the one, Chuck.

520
00:46:13,381 --> 00:46:14,631
Thanks for the tip.

521
00:46:14,633 --> 00:46:16,968
Love that hustle, Chuck!

522
00:46:21,180 --> 00:46:24,684
Does anyone know
where I can find Leo's Toy Store?

523
00:46:46,372 --> 00:46:48,664
Leo's Toy Store.

524
00:46:48,666 --> 00:46:49,666
Nope.

525
00:46:49,668 --> 00:46:54,211
No. No. No.

526
00:46:54,213 --> 00:46:56,006
Where is it?

527
00:46:58,802 --> 00:47:01,385
He's going into the grown-up's section.

528
00:47:01,387 --> 00:47:03,014
Is that legal?

529
00:47:07,686 --> 00:47:11,187
Charles? I've never seen
you in here before.

530
00:47:11,189 --> 00:47:13,774
Marcie, thank goodness I found you.

531
00:47:13,776 --> 00:47:16,401
Can you help me find
a copy of Leo's Toy Store?

532
00:47:16,403 --> 00:47:19,445
Did you say "Leo's Toy Store"?

533
00:47:19,447 --> 00:47:22,282
Yeah. Peppermint Patty told me
you said it was the greatest...

534
00:47:22,284 --> 00:47:25,702
Stop right there, Charles. Come with me.

535
00:47:25,704 --> 00:47:28,454
This is what you're looking for.

536
00:47:28,456 --> 00:47:31,667
Leo Tolstoy's War and Peace.

537
00:47:36,423 --> 00:47:39,173
Yikes. How long was this war?

538
00:47:39,175 --> 00:47:41,718
Are you sure that is the book
you want to read?

539
00:47:41,720 --> 00:47:45,847
Might I remind you, Charles, you only have
the weekend to complete your report.

540
00:47:45,849 --> 00:47:49,644
I have to if I'm going to win
that gold star.

541
00:47:52,814 --> 00:47:54,941
I'm okay.

542
00:48:04,702 --> 00:48:06,158
Big book.

543
00:48:06,160 --> 00:48:08,996
How are you gonna get it home,
smarty-pants?

544
00:48:18,381 --> 00:48:19,588
Pretty smart.

545
00:48:19,590 --> 00:48:20,756
What am I saying?

546
00:48:20,758 --> 00:48:23,468
Good ol' Charlie Brown.

547
00:48:23,470 --> 00:48:26,264
Now there's a guy who's going places.

548
00:48:38,485 --> 00:48:40,153
Thanks.

549
00:48:48,912 --> 00:48:50,662
Surprise!

550
00:48:50,664 --> 00:48:51,912
Happy Birthday!

551
00:48:51,914 --> 00:48:53,791
Who invited him?

552
00:49:10,434 --> 00:49:12,809
War and Peace. Page one.

553
00:49:12,811 --> 00:49:17,149
"Eh bien, mon prince, so Genoa..."

554
00:49:19,693 --> 00:49:22,946
Hey, Charlie Brown, come out and play!

555
00:49:25,240 --> 00:49:26,698
Sorry, guys.

556
00:49:26,700 --> 00:49:28,450
- Who reads a book on the weekend?
- Not me.

557
00:49:28,452 --> 00:49:29,992
Okay. Where was I?

558
00:49:29,994 --> 00:49:33,287
"Took a horse from a commander,
and hungry and weary..."

559
00:49:33,289 --> 00:49:36,333
"...and the musketry fire
sounded far away..."

560
00:49:41,340 --> 00:49:44,383
"Prince Andrei mused
on the unimportance of greatness..."

561
00:49:44,385 --> 00:49:47,343
"unimportance of life,
which no one could understand..."

562
00:49:47,345 --> 00:49:50,347
"and there was yesterday,
and there was the day before..."

563
00:49:54,019 --> 00:49:56,477
Okay, show's over. Clear it out.

564
00:49:56,479 --> 00:49:57,729
Will there be a late show?

565
00:49:57,731 --> 00:50:00,941
"And to recognize a dependence
we do not feel."

566
00:50:00,943 --> 00:50:03,693
"The end."

567
00:50:03,695 --> 00:50:05,362
I did it.

568
00:50:17,418 --> 00:50:20,044
It's all coming together now.

569
00:50:21,713 --> 00:50:27,718
Okay. This is my book report
about War and Peace.

570
00:50:27,720 --> 00:50:31,762
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.

571
00:50:31,764 --> 00:50:33,724
First there was war.

572
00:50:33,726 --> 00:50:35,767
Then there was peace.

573
00:50:35,769 --> 00:50:40,398
10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17.

574
00:50:41,525 --> 00:50:45,570
Only 983 words to go.

575
00:50:51,785 --> 00:50:53,245
Rats!

576
00:50:58,459 --> 00:51:00,082
This is no use.

577
00:51:00,084 --> 00:51:03,295
I'm just not as smart
as they think I am.

578
00:51:10,012 --> 00:51:12,762
I can't let her down.

579
00:51:12,764 --> 00:51:16,557
There's still time. You can do this.

580
00:51:16,559 --> 00:51:18,561
You can't give up on her now.

581
00:51:26,403 --> 00:51:28,570
998, 999...

582
00:51:28,572 --> 00:51:31,615
1000. Finished.

583
00:51:39,999 --> 00:51:41,916
Wake up, big brother!

584
00:51:41,918 --> 00:51:45,461
Today's the big assembly
to celebrate your perfect score.

585
00:51:45,463 --> 00:51:47,006
Come see!

586
00:51:48,050 --> 00:51:49,675
What are you up to now?

587
00:51:49,677 --> 00:51:53,053
Now that you're a big celebrity,
we have to move fast.

588
00:51:53,055 --> 00:51:56,765
I have shirts, hats, mugs, and more.

589
00:51:56,767 --> 00:52:01,477
The fame that comes with intellectual
superiority can be very fleeting.

590
00:52:01,479 --> 00:52:04,564
You have to cash in while you can.

591
00:52:04,566 --> 00:52:09,154
Today is going to be a big day for us,
big brother.

592
00:52:13,659 --> 00:52:16,535
Thank you. Come again soon.

593
00:52:16,537 --> 00:52:20,622
This is all for you, Charlie Brown.
You've really made it.

594
00:52:20,624 --> 00:52:22,416
It's going to happen.

595
00:52:22,418 --> 00:52:26,836
She's finally going to notice me
for doing something great.

596
00:52:26,838 --> 00:52:28,671
Charlie Brown.

597
00:52:28,673 --> 00:52:31,173
I hate to admit it, you blockhead...

598
00:52:31,175 --> 00:52:36,470
but public opinion leads me to believe,
that after all these years...

599
00:52:36,472 --> 00:52:38,974
I may have been wrong about you.

600
00:52:38,976 --> 00:52:40,684
This is not easy for me!

601
00:52:40,686 --> 00:52:44,314
My whole world has turned upside-down!

602
00:52:47,568 --> 00:52:51,488
Can I please have Charlie Brown
come to the stage?

603
00:52:59,537 --> 00:53:02,039
It is my pleasure
to present to you today...

604
00:53:02,041 --> 00:53:06,042
this award for the highest achievement
in this year's standardized testing.

605
00:53:06,044 --> 00:53:10,171
But before I do,
the school proclamation.

606
00:53:10,173 --> 00:53:15,510
"On this day, whereas you have upheld
the highest of academic standards.

607
00:53:15,512 --> 00:53:19,890
"And whereas no one would have
ever expected that of you."

608
00:53:19,892 --> 00:53:24,602
"And whereas you are the first
to ever receive a perfect score."

609
00:53:24,604 --> 00:53:29,191
"Therefore, be it resolved that today
is declared Charlie Brown Day."

610
00:53:29,193 --> 00:53:31,653
"Signed, Miss Othmar."

611
00:53:42,664 --> 00:53:45,041
That's my big brother!

612
00:53:47,919 --> 00:53:52,088
How about that, Charlie Brown?
You're the star of the school now!

613
00:53:52,090 --> 00:53:54,048
Congratulations, Charles.

614
00:53:54,050 --> 00:53:57,428
Let me present you
with your perfect test.

615
00:54:01,182 --> 00:54:04,686
Oh, no. I must have signed
the wrong paper.

616
00:54:24,914 --> 00:54:30,169
Before I begin, I'd like to thank
all of you for your support.

617
00:54:32,088 --> 00:54:33,963
You have all been so kind.

618
00:54:33,965 --> 00:54:37,968
It's not often that I get
this sort of recognition.

619
00:54:37,970 --> 00:54:40,845
But...

620
00:54:40,847 --> 00:54:42,807
there's been a mistake.

621
00:54:46,061 --> 00:54:49,104
This is not my test.

622
00:54:50,148 --> 00:54:53,316
I knew it!

623
00:54:53,318 --> 00:54:58,321
Therefore, I cannot accept this honor.

624
00:54:58,323 --> 00:55:01,240
Can a brother and sister get a divorce?

625
00:55:01,242 --> 00:55:06,163
I think this belongs to Peppermint Patty.
She's the real genius.

626
00:55:24,849 --> 00:55:29,602
That was a very admirable thing
you just did, Charlie Brown.

627
00:55:29,604 --> 00:55:33,023
One moment I'm the hero,
the next I'm the goat.

628
00:55:33,025 --> 00:55:37,736
Maybe things will go your way again
after you hand in your book report.

629
00:55:37,738 --> 00:55:40,071
I'm not so sure.

630
00:55:40,073 --> 00:55:43,700
I was up all night working on it
and I can't remember a single word.

631
00:55:43,702 --> 00:55:46,702
Surely it's not as bad
as you think, Charlie Brown.

632
00:55:46,704 --> 00:55:48,873
Let me see what you wrote.

633
00:55:52,001 --> 00:55:57,046
Charlie Brown, the insight you bring to
such a complex novel is beyond reproach.

634
00:55:57,048 --> 00:56:01,218
You two are sure to win the gold star
with a book report of this quality.

635
00:56:01,220 --> 00:56:02,970
Book report?

636
00:56:02,972 --> 00:56:05,722
Were we supposed to do a book report?

637
00:56:05,724 --> 00:56:08,350
Hi. In light of the fact
that you were away...

638
00:56:08,352 --> 00:56:12,312
Charlie Brown took it upon himself to
complete the report for the both of you.

639
00:56:12,314 --> 00:56:14,814
And I must say,
this is one of the finest bits...

640
00:56:14,816 --> 00:56:17,318
of literary analysis I have ever read.

641
00:56:32,209 --> 00:56:34,669
No, no, no!

642
00:56:39,008 --> 00:56:41,802
Oh, good grief.

643
00:56:43,387 --> 00:56:45,639
Maybe we can fix it?

644
00:56:53,771 --> 00:56:57,275
Chapter 4. Curse you, Red Baron!

645
01:00:05,463 --> 01:00:11,135
The Flying Ace set out
across the hostile countryside undeterred.

646
01:00:43,334 --> 01:00:48,546
Whenever I feel really alone,
I just sit and stare into the night sky.

647
01:00:48,548 --> 01:00:52,091
I've always thought
that one of those stars was my star...

648
01:00:52,093 --> 01:00:57,180
and at moments like this, I know that
my star will always be there for me.

649
01:00:57,182 --> 01:01:01,770
Like a comforting voice saying,
"Don't give up, kid."

650
01:01:06,066 --> 01:01:09,233
The Flying Ace had to return
to the aerodrome...

651
01:01:09,235 --> 01:01:11,821
if he was ever to rescue Fifi.

652
01:01:34,720 --> 01:01:36,513
Hey.

653
01:02:18,680 --> 01:02:19,720
Wait for my cue.

654
01:02:19,722 --> 01:02:21,640
Timing is crucial
if we're going to succeed.

655
01:02:21,642 --> 01:02:22,765
They'll never expect us.

656
01:02:22,767 --> 01:02:25,059
Eyes on me and wait for my signal.

657
01:02:25,061 --> 01:02:29,523
Christmas time is here.

658
01:02:29,525 --> 01:02:33,903
Happiness and cheer.

659
01:02:39,785 --> 01:02:44,623
Yeah, Chuck, your crazy dog
is over here again.

660
01:03:22,244 --> 01:03:27,497
Excuse me, mister.
Have you ever flown a kite?

661
01:03:27,499 --> 01:03:31,501
Well, actually, let me just say that...

662
01:03:31,503 --> 01:03:34,338
I have years of experience with kites,
but I...

663
01:03:34,340 --> 01:03:35,713
That's great!

664
01:03:35,715 --> 01:03:38,466
Oh! Well, okay.

665
01:03:38,468 --> 01:03:41,720
The thing is,
flying a kite isn't for everyone.

666
01:03:41,722 --> 01:03:43,847
It takes a certain type of person.

667
01:03:43,849 --> 01:03:47,600
It can be frustrating at times.
They tend to have a mind of their own.

668
01:03:47,602 --> 01:03:51,479
But with determination and dedication,
you can make it happen.

669
01:03:51,481 --> 01:03:52,521
Really?

670
01:03:52,523 --> 01:03:55,441
Here. You hold the string.
Plant your feet.

671
01:03:55,443 --> 01:03:57,653
Weight forward. Knees bent.

672
01:03:57,655 --> 01:03:59,863
Back straight. Head up.

673
01:03:59,865 --> 01:04:02,865
And remember, keep it simple.

674
01:04:02,867 --> 01:04:04,283
Okay.

675
01:04:04,285 --> 01:04:06,702
When I say "go,"
run as fast as you can.

676
01:04:06,704 --> 01:04:08,873
Which way, mister?

677
01:04:12,711 --> 01:04:15,088
That way. Now, go!

678
01:04:18,883 --> 01:04:22,135
I hope the little guy
doesn't get discouraged, Snoopy.

679
01:04:22,137 --> 01:04:24,553
He doesn't quite know
how difficult this will be.

680
01:04:24,555 --> 01:04:27,557
It may take him years
to gain my level of experience.

681
01:04:27,559 --> 01:04:30,227
It doesn't just happen over-...

682
01:04:30,229 --> 01:04:32,854
Woo-hoo! It's flying!

683
01:04:32,856 --> 01:04:34,564
Wow!

684
01:04:34,566 --> 01:04:38,234
Thanks, mister.
You sure know your kites.

685
01:04:38,236 --> 01:04:40,280
Do you want to try?

686
01:04:47,287 --> 01:04:48,704
You can do it!

687
01:04:48,706 --> 01:04:50,916
Don't give up!

688
01:04:52,918 --> 01:04:56,671
Chapter 7. Never give up!

689
01:04:58,215 --> 01:05:03,803
The Flying Ace knew this would be the
last chance to save the love of his life.

690
01:08:31,804 --> 01:08:35,888
The Flying Ace returned to the aerodrome
with the love of his life.

691
01:08:35,890 --> 01:08:38,434
He returned a hero.

692
01:08:45,067 --> 01:08:47,650
"And so, as our hero observed..."

693
01:08:47,652 --> 01:08:51,738
"he was destined to face
the infamous Red Baron another day."

694
01:08:51,740 --> 01:08:53,489
A dog that flies?

695
01:08:53,491 --> 01:08:56,410
This is the dumbest thing
I have ever read!

696
01:09:05,586 --> 01:09:08,048
I got dog germs!

697
01:09:13,429 --> 01:09:16,012
Come on, Charlie Brown!

698
01:09:16,014 --> 01:09:19,226
Today calls for something special.
Here we go.

699
01:09:20,978 --> 01:09:22,019
Hey, guys.

700
01:09:22,021 --> 01:09:24,145
It's the last day of school!

701
01:09:24,147 --> 01:09:26,731
Well, big brother, can you believe it?

702
01:09:26,733 --> 01:09:31,569
No more reading, writing, arithmetic.
No more learning ever!

703
01:09:31,571 --> 01:09:34,823
What are you talking about?
This is just the start of summer vacation.

704
01:09:34,825 --> 01:09:36,949
You have eight more years
of grammar school.

705
01:09:36,951 --> 01:09:38,618
Four more years of high school.

706
01:09:38,620 --> 01:09:40,620
- Eight...
- Plus four more years of college.

707
01:09:40,622 --> 01:09:44,458
Plus four.
Add the one to an extra four...

708
01:09:44,460 --> 01:09:47,668
That's over 37 years of school!

709
01:09:47,670 --> 01:09:51,215
I'll be bald and wrinkly by then.

710
01:09:55,054 --> 01:09:56,802
Look at that!

711
01:09:56,804 --> 01:09:58,430
Is that Snoopy?

712
01:10:01,809 --> 01:10:03,311
Lucky.

713
01:10:07,732 --> 01:10:12,195
Okay, everyone, listen up.
I know this is the last day of school...

714
01:10:13,613 --> 01:10:15,780
But first, before we leave...

715
01:10:15,782 --> 01:10:20,243
we need to finish picking our partners
for this year's summer pen-pal project.

716
01:10:20,245 --> 01:10:24,040
When I draw a name,
stand if you want to be their partner.

717
01:10:25,084 --> 01:10:28,251
Here we go. The next name is... Pigpen!

718
01:10:28,253 --> 01:10:32,588
I will. A little dirt never hurt anyone.

719
01:10:32,590 --> 01:10:33,590
Schroeder.

720
01:10:33,592 --> 01:10:35,257
I do!

721
01:10:35,259 --> 01:10:37,678
I mean, I will.

722
01:10:39,682 --> 01:10:41,265
Charlie Brown.

723
01:10:44,103 --> 01:10:46,146
I will.

724
01:10:47,772 --> 01:10:50,107
She will?

725
01:10:55,613 --> 01:10:57,616
Summer time!

726
01:11:00,952 --> 01:11:02,370
Hi!

727
01:11:04,956 --> 01:11:06,873
Charlie Brown, where have you been?

728
01:11:06,875 --> 01:11:09,083
It's the first day of summer.

729
01:11:09,085 --> 01:11:11,794
You should be down there
having fun with everyone else.

730
01:11:11,796 --> 01:11:14,547
I can't stop thinking about it, Linus.

731
01:11:14,549 --> 01:11:18,092
After all the humiliating disasters
she witnessed this year...

732
01:11:18,094 --> 01:11:19,886
why would she choose me?

733
01:11:19,888 --> 01:11:21,762
Was she feeling sorry for me?

734
01:11:21,764 --> 01:11:25,309
I don't want her to choose me just
because she was feeling sorry for me.

735
01:11:25,311 --> 01:11:28,020
I have slightly more dignity than that.

736
01:11:28,022 --> 01:11:29,604
Charlie Brown...

737
01:11:29,606 --> 01:11:32,774
it might be time to consider
the wild possibility...

738
01:11:32,776 --> 01:11:36,653
that you're a good person
and that people like you.

739
01:11:36,655 --> 01:11:39,655
But, you know, you'll never
really know the answer, unless...

740
01:11:39,657 --> 01:11:41,158
I just go up and talk to her!

741
01:11:41,160 --> 01:11:44,329
I should've listened to you all along!

742
01:12:06,018 --> 01:12:09,935
Oh! "Charles." I mean, "Charlie Brown."

743
01:12:09,937 --> 01:12:11,812
She's not here?

744
01:12:11,814 --> 01:12:13,856
On her way to summer camp?

745
01:12:13,858 --> 01:12:16,068
So the bus hasn't left school yet?

746
01:12:16,070 --> 01:12:17,696
But it's about to leave?

747
01:12:20,698 --> 01:12:23,285
And, by the way,
it was a pleasure to meet you, ma'am.

748
01:12:25,286 --> 01:12:27,870
Charlie Brown!

749
01:12:27,872 --> 01:12:29,707
You blockhead!

750
01:12:32,085 --> 01:12:33,586
All right!

751
01:13:18,965 --> 01:13:21,258
How do I get out of here?

752
01:13:30,853 --> 01:13:34,314
The whole world seems to be
conspiring against me.

753
01:13:35,857 --> 01:13:40,277
I'm just asking for a little help
for once in my life.

754
01:13:49,037 --> 01:13:50,745
Get out of here!

755
01:13:50,747 --> 01:13:52,249
Not you, too!

756
01:13:55,376 --> 01:13:57,795
Hey look, it's Charlie Brown!

757
01:14:03,469 --> 01:14:06,177
Charlie Brown is flying a kite?

758
01:14:06,179 --> 01:14:09,557
Charlie Brown is flying a kite!

759
01:14:11,809 --> 01:14:13,935
Wow! Chuck's got a kite in the air.

760
01:14:13,937 --> 01:14:15,689
Way to go, Charles!

761
01:14:18,317 --> 01:14:21,695
Charlie Brown is really doing it!
He's flying a kite!

762
01:14:43,842 --> 01:14:46,842
Oh, hi, Charlie Brown.

763
01:14:46,844 --> 01:14:48,803
You remembered my name?

764
01:14:48,805 --> 01:14:51,097
Of course I did.

765
01:14:51,099 --> 01:14:55,185
Before you leave,
there's something I really need to know.

766
01:14:55,187 --> 01:15:02,441
Why, out of all the kids in our class,
would you want to be partners with me?

767
01:15:02,443 --> 01:15:04,110
That's easy.

768
01:15:04,112 --> 01:15:08,073
Because I've seen
the type of person you are.

769
01:15:08,075 --> 01:15:12,368
An insecure, wishy-washy failure?

770
01:15:12,370 --> 01:15:15,038
That's not who you are at all.

771
01:15:15,040 --> 01:15:18,874
I like the compassion you showed
for your sister at the talent show.

772
01:15:18,876 --> 01:15:21,377
The honesty you had at the assembly.

773
01:15:21,379 --> 01:15:25,717
And at the dance,
you were brave, and funny.

774
01:15:27,052 --> 01:15:29,011
And what you did for me...

775
01:15:29,013 --> 01:15:33,390
doing the book report while I was away,
was so sweet of you.

776
01:15:35,561 --> 01:15:39,104
So when I look at you,
I don't see a failure at all.

777
01:15:39,106 --> 01:15:43,233
You have all the qualities
that I admire.

778
01:15:43,235 --> 01:15:46,071
Sorry, I have to go now.

779
01:15:47,572 --> 01:15:49,823
Wait.

780
01:15:49,825 --> 01:15:52,575
I think this belongs to you.

781
01:15:52,577 --> 01:15:57,040
Thank you. I've been looking
everywhere for this!

782
01:15:59,960 --> 01:16:02,587
I'll write to you, pen-pal.

783
01:16:04,255 --> 01:16:05,756
Bye!

784
01:16:16,977 --> 01:16:18,687
Is he okay?

785
01:16:26,195 --> 01:16:30,529
It must feel pretty great being
Charlie Brown right about now.

786
01:16:30,531 --> 01:16:32,074
You did it.

787
01:16:33,451 --> 01:16:35,077
Nice job, Chuck.

788
01:16:35,079 --> 01:16:36,453
Good job, Charles!

789
01:16:36,455 --> 01:16:38,081
Hey, big brother!

790
01:16:41,085 --> 01:16:45,087
I'm proud to be your little sister.

791
01:16:45,089 --> 01:16:47,463
Out of my way!

792
01:16:47,465 --> 01:16:50,926
I really need to tell you something,
you blockhead.

793
01:16:50,928 --> 01:16:53,345
You're still full of surprises.

794
01:16:53,347 --> 01:16:56,099
Good ol' Charlie Brown!

795
01:18:00,205 --> 01:18:01,954
Charlie Brown.

796
01:18:01,956 --> 01:18:04,041
Oh, Charlie Brown.

797
01:18:04,043 --> 01:18:06,376
I'll hold the football and you kick it.

798
01:18:06,378 --> 01:18:08,962
You say you'll hold it,
but what you really mean is...

799
01:18:08,964 --> 01:18:12,173
you'll pull it away, and I'll land
on my back and I'll kill myself.

800
01:18:12,175 --> 01:18:14,508
But I feel I have really
come to know you.

801
01:18:14,510 --> 01:18:19,556
I now understand that you are kind,
compassionate, brave, and funny.

802
01:18:19,558 --> 01:18:24,144
No one would pull a football away
from a person with all those qualities.

803
01:18:24,146 --> 01:18:25,227
She's right.

804
01:18:25,229 --> 01:18:29,106
I would never pull the ball away
from someone with all those qualities.

805
01:18:29,108 --> 01:18:32,236
I'm gonna kick this ball
all the way to the moon.

806
01:18:38,576 --> 01:18:41,954
And gullible.
I forgot to mention "gullible."

807
01:19:34,174 --> 01:19:38,804
A round of root beers for our hero,
the Flying Ace!
