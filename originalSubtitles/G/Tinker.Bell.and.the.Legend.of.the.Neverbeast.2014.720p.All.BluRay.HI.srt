So, I'm gonna take him to the Queen

559
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:08,119
Then I'll tell her how he destroyed
Sunflower Meadow.

Maybe it was both of us.

This is the NeverBeast.

<i>I know that our love will still be here</i>

1083
01:10:25,120 --> 01:10:31,268
<i>In a thousand years</i>

1084
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:43,830
<i>So close your eyes, my dear</i>

1085
01:10:44,400 --> 01:10:49,639
<i>Knowing that our love is going to last</i>

1086
01:10:49,640 --> 01:10:53,786
<i>One thousand years</i>
