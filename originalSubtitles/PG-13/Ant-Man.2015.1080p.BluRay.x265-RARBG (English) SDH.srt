Good morning, Hank.

you could find the time to join us today.

198
00:10:25,863 --> 00:10:29,072
Now, before we start,
I'd like to introduce a very special guest.

199
00:10:29,143 --> 00:10:31,509
This company's founder and my mentor,

200
00:10:32,182 --> 00:10:33,183
Dr. Hank Pym.

201
00:10:48,822 --> 00:10:50,790
When I took over this company
for Dr. Pym,

202
00:10:50,862 --> 00:10:53,103
I immediately started
researching a particle

203
00:10:53,182 --> 00:10:55,947
that could change
the distance between atoms,

204
00:10:56,022 --> 00:10:58,866
while increasing density and strength.

205
00:10:59,342 --> 00:11:02,425
Why this revolutionary idea
remained buried

206
00:11:02,502 --> 00:11:06,791
beneath the dust and cobwebs of
Hank's research, I couldn't tell you.

207
00:11:06,862 --> 00:11:08,785
But just imagine,

208
00:11:08,862 --> 00:11:13,106
a soldier the size of an insect.

209
00:11:16,622 --> 00:11:18,112

Right, Hank?

215
00:11:41,302 --> 00:11:42,792

216
00:11:43,222 --> 00:11:44,951

217
00:11:46,422 --> 00:11:48,390

218
00:11:48,462 --> 00:11:52,308
Hank, will you tell our guests
what you told me

219
00:11:52,382 --> 00:11:55,909
every single time I asked you,

220
00:11:57,502 --> 00:11:59,982
"Was the Ant-Man real?"

221
00:12:00,062 --> 00:12:01,712
Just a tall tale.

222
00:12:01,782 --> 00:12:02,829
Right.

223
00:12:02,902 --> 00:12:05,985
Because how could anything
so miraculous possibly be real?

224
00:12:16,422 --> 00:12:20,029
Well, I was inspired by the legend
of the Ant-Man.

225
00:12:20,102 --> 00:12:22,946
And with my breakthrough
shrinking inorganic material,

226
00:12:23,022 --> 00:12:26,071
I thought, could it be possible
to shrink a person?

227
00:12:26,942 --> 00:12:28,546
Could that be done?

228
00:12:29,462 --> 00:12:33,353
Well, it's not a legend anymore.

366
00:19:01,141 --> 00:19:03,906
You know, I've been thinking a lot
about gratitude lately.

367
00:19:03,981 --> 00:19:06,348
And today,
during my morning meditation,

368
00:19:06,421 --> 00:19:09,345
an interesting thought occurred to me,
and I think it might apply to you, too.

369

How's that?

Gratitude can be forgiveness.

373
00:19:20,341 --> 00:19:22,184

374
00:19:22,861 --> 00:19:24,511
I chose my mentor poorly.

375
00:19:25,341 --> 00:19:27,150
You didn't even have a choice.

376
00:19:27,861 --> 00:19:30,148
He never believed in you.

377
00:19:31,061 --> 00:19:35,783
It's a shame what we had to do,
but he forced us to do it, didn't he?

378
00:19:36,181 --> 00:19:39,185
But we shouldn't be angry,
we should be grateful.

379
00:19:39,941 --> 00:19:42,831
Because his failures as a mentor,

380
00:19:42,901 --> 00:19:45,029
as a father,

381
00:19:45,621 --> 00:19:48,704

701
00:42:17,858 --> 00:42:20,179
You don't need to raise your hand, Scott.

702
00:42:20,738 --> 00:42:23,389
Sorry, I just have one question.

703
00:42:23,458 --> 00:42:25,586
Who are you, who is she,
what the hell's going on,

704
00:42:25,658 --> 00:42:27,308
and can I go back to jail now?

705
00:42:27,378 --> 00:42:28,789
Come with me.

706
00:42:29,418 --> 00:42:33,548
40 years ago, I created a formula
that altered atomic relative distance.

707
00:42:33,618 --> 00:42:34,824
SCOTT: Huh?

708
00:42:34,898 --> 00:42:37,139
I learned how to change
the distance between atoms.

709
00:42:37,218 --> 00:42:38,947
That's what powers the suit.

710
00:42:39,018 --> 00:42:40,702
That's why it works.

711
00:42:41,898 --> 00:42:42,899

00:42:48,298 --> 00:42:49,902
- Whoa!
- But it was dangerous.

714
00:42:50,578 --> 00:42:52,660
It was too dangerous.

715
00:42:53,898 --> 00:42:55,866
So I hid it from the world.

716
00:42:56,698 --> 00:42:59,668
And that's when I switched gears
and I started my own company.

717

Pym Tech.

718
00:43:01,778 --> 00:43:02,904
Yes.

719
00:43:03,858 --> 00:43:07,658
I took on a young protégé
called Darren Cross.

720
00:43:07,738 --> 00:43:08,978
SCOTT: Darren Cross.

721
00:43:09,058 --> 00:43:10,105
He's a big deal.

722
00:43:10,178 --> 00:43:12,658
But before he was a big deal,
he was my assistant.

723
00:43:12,738 --> 00:43:17,062
I thought I saw something in him.
The son I never had, perhaps.

724
00:43:17,138 --> 00:43:19,459
He was brilliant,
but as we became close,

725
00:43:19,538 --> 00:43:23,099
he began to suspect
that I wasn't telling him everything.

726
00:43:23,218 --> 00:43:26,859
He heard rumors about
what was called the Pym Particle,

727
00:43:26,938 --> 00:43:30,147
and he became obsessed
with recreating my formula.

728
00:43:30,658 --> 00:43:31,705
But I wouldn't help him.

729
00:43:31,778 --> 00:43:35,624
So he conspired against me and
he voted me out of my own company.

730
00:43:35,698 --> 00:43:37,223
How could he do that?

731
00:43:37,298 --> 00:43:40,108
The board's chairman
is my daughter, Hope.

732
00:43:40,178 --> 00:43:41,509
She was the deciding vote.

733
00:43:43,658 --> 00:43:45,103
But she came back to me

734
00:43:45,178 --> 00:43:48,546
when she saw how close
Cross was to cracking my formula.

735
00:43:49,618 --> 00:43:51,859
The process is highly volatile.

the most stable guy to begin with.

HOPE: <i>The Yellowjacket pod

And the only access point is a tube

894

5 millimeters in diameter.

Why do I have a sick feeling
in my stomach?

896
00:52:47,776 --> 00:52:49,983
HOPE: <i>The tube is protected
by a laser grid,</i>

897
00:52:50,056 --> 00:52:51,820
and we can only power that down
for 15 seconds.

898
00:52:51,896 --> 00:52:54,502
You're gonna need to signal
the crazy ants to blow the servers,

retrieve the suit, and exit the vaults
before the backup power comes on.

That's good. That's very good.

have to learn how to control him.

Do you have any idea what
he's asking you to risk?

You have a daughter.

940
00:55:35,336 --> 00:55:36,667
I'm doing this for her.

941
00:55:36,736 --> 00:55:39,706
You know, when my mother died,
I didn't see him for two weeks.

942
00:55:40,456 --> 00:55:41,456
He was in grief.

943
00:55:41,536 --> 00:55:42,901
Yeah, so was I, and I was seven.

944
00:55:42,976 --> 00:55:45,582
And he never came back.
Not in any way that counted.

945
00:55:46,536 --> 00:55:48,379
He just sent me off to boarding school.

946
00:55:49,696 --> 00:55:50,697
You know, I thought,

00:55:51,536 --> 00:55:52,901
with all that's at stake,

948
00:55:52,976 --> 00:55:56,139
just maybe we might have a chance
of making peace.

949
00:55:56,216 --> 00:55:58,139
But, even now,
he still wants to shut me out.

950
00:55:58,216 --> 00:56:01,106
He doesn't wanna shut you out.
He trusts you.

951
00:56:01,176 --> 00:56:02,541
Then why are you here?

952
00:56:02,616 --> 00:56:04,618

954
00:56:09,576 --> 00:56:11,226
I'm expendable.

955
00:56:11,856 --> 00:56:13,301
That's why I'm here.

956
00:56:14,456 --> 00:56:16,299
You must have realized that by now.

957
00:56:17,176 --> 00:56:19,383
I mean, it's why I'm in the suit
and you're not.

958

than lose you.

00:56:37,416 --> 00:56:38,577
What's her name?

Cassie.

964
00:56:41,656 --> 00:56:43,420
It's a pretty name.

965
00:56:46,816 --> 00:56:49,660
You have to clear your mind, Scott.
You have to make your thoughts precise.

966

That's how it works.

967
00:56:52,856 --> 00:56:54,267
Think about Cassie.

968
00:56:54,336 --> 00:56:58,261
About how badly you want to see her.
And use that to focus.

Open your eyes

970
00:57:08,856 --> 00:57:11,223

what you want the ants to do.

to let her join me on my missions.

974
00:57:59,736 --> 00:58:01,898
They called her the Wasp.

975

00:58:08,696 --> 00:58:11,700
that I don't regret having said yes.

978
00:58:16,176 --> 00:58:17,860
It was 1987.

979
00:58:18,656 --> 00:58:23,139
Separatists had hijacked
a Soviet missile silo in Kursk

980
00:58:24,696 --> 00:58:27,666
and launched an ICBM
at the United States.

<i>The only way to the internal mechanics</i>

982
00:58:38,336 --> 00:58:40,259
<i>was through solid titanium.</i>

983
00:58:49,536 --> 00:58:54,258
<i>I knew I had to shrink between
the molecules to disarm the missile.</i>

984
00:58:54,336 --> 00:58:57,579
<i>But my regulator had sustained
too much damage.</i>

985
00:58:59,296 --> 00:59:00,741
<i>Your mother,</i>

986
00:59:00,816 --> 00:59:02,181
<i>she didn't hesitate.</i>

987

Janet! No!

988
00:59:12,696 --> 00:59:15,176
She turned off her regulator

989
00:59:15,936 --> 00:59:17,665
and went subatomic

990
00:59:19,136 --> 00:59:21,264
to deactivate the bomb.

991
00:59:23,056 --> 00:59:24,865
And she was gone.

992
00:59:29,295 --> 00:59:31,423
Your mom died a hero.

993
00:59:34,095 --> 00:59:36,416
And I spent the next 10 years

994
00:59:36,535 --> 00:59:40,859
trying to learn all I could
about the quantum realm.

995
00:59:44,415 --> 00:59:46,543
You were trying to bring her back.

996
00:59:48,175 --> 00:59:51,782
But all I learned was we know nothing.

997
00:59:56,775 --> 00:59:58,618
It's not your fault.

998
01:00:00,775 --> 01:00:02,459
She made her choice.

999

(VOICE BREAKING)
But why didn't you tell me that sooner?

1000
01:00:11,695 --> 01:00:14,665
I was trying to protect you.

1001
01:00:16,495 --> 01:00:18,145
I lost your mother.

1002
01:00:20,335 --> 01:00:23,020
I didn't mean to lose you, too.

1003
01:00:23,855 --> 01:00:25,220
I'm sorry.

1004
01:00:28,655 --> 01:00:29,861
This is awesome.

1005
01:00:30,935 --> 01:00:32,619
It's awesome, you know?

1006
01:00:32,695 --> 01:00:34,777
You guys are breaking down walls,
you're healing.

1007
01:00:35,855 --> 01:00:37,300
It's important.

1008
01:00:40,215 --> 01:00:41,705
I ruined the moment, didn't I?

1009
01:00:41,775 --> 01:00:43,504
Yes, you did. Yes.

1010
01:00:44,655 --> 01:00:46,578
I'm going to make some tea.

1011
01:00:52,215 --> 01:00:53,296

You couldn't make a suit
with a flannel lining?

1016
01:01:41,855 --> 01:01:44,586
You must retrieve this prototype
of a signal decoy.

1017

I had a sensor trip
but I'm not seeing anything.

1047
01:03:03,815 --> 01:03:04,816
Wait a second.

1048
01:03:04,935 --> 01:03:06,903
HANK: Abort, Scott! Abort now!

1049
01:03:06,975 --> 01:03:08,500
It's okay. He can't see me.

1050
01:03:08,575 --> 01:03:09,622
I can see you.

1051
01:03:09,695 --> 01:03:10,856
He can see me.

1052
01:03:13,215 --> 01:03:15,138
Hi. I'm Scott.

1053
01:03:15,215 --> 01:03:16,865
Did he just say, "Hi, I'm Scott"?

1054
01:03:16,935 --> 01:03:20,223
- What are you doing here?
- First off, I'm a big fan.

1055
01:03:20,295 --> 01:03:21,945
Appreciate it. So, who the hell are you?

1056
01:03:22,775 --> 01:03:23,936
I'm Ant-Man.

1057
01:03:24,015 --> 01:03:25,255
"Ant-Man"?

1058
01:03:25,375 --> 01:03:27,457
What? You haven't heard of me?

1059
01:03:27,535 --> 01:03:29,299
No, you wouldn't have heard of me.

1060
01:03:29,695 --> 01:03:31,140
You wanna tell me what you want?

1061
01:03:31,255 --> 01:03:33,656
I was hoping I could grab
a piece of technology.

1062
01:03:33,735 --> 01:03:35,464
Just for a few days. I'm gonna return it.

1063
01:03:35,535 --> 01:03:38,186
I need it to save the world.
You know how that is.

1064
01:03:38,255 --> 01:03:39,666
I know exactly how that is.

1065
01:03:40,575 --> 01:03:41,622
Located the breach.

1066
01:03:41,695 --> 01:03:43,175
- Bringing him in.
- Sorry about this!

1067
01:03:47,655 --> 01:03:49,180
What the hell are you doing?

1068
01:03:52,135 --> 01:03:54,855
FALCON: Breach is an adult male,
who has some sort of shrinking tech.

1069
01:04:08,015 --> 01:04:09,221
SCOTT: Sorry!

1070
01:04:09,335 --> 01:04:10,825
Look, I'm sorry about this. Sorry.

1071
01:04:11,575 --> 01:04:12,576
That's enough!

1072
01:04:34,375 --> 01:04:35,456
(GROANING)

1073
01:04:35,615 --> 01:04:37,299
Ant-thony! A little help!

1074
01:04:49,935 --> 01:04:51,061
I've lost visual.

1075

(GRUNTING)

1076
01:05:00,335 --> 01:05:01,575
He's inside my pack!

1077
01:05:01,655 --> 01:05:02,702
Sorry!

1078
01:05:04,295 --> 01:05:05,615
You seem like a really great guy.

1079
01:05:15,135 --> 01:05:16,705
(GRUNTING)

1080
01:05:30,655 --> 01:05:34,455
It's really important to me
that Cap never finds out about this.

1081
01:05:37,735 --> 01:05:41,262
That was completely irresponsible
and dangerous!

1082
01:05:41,935 --> 01:05:44,176
You jeopardized everything!

1083
01:06:00,135 --> 01:06:01,739
You got it.

1084
01:06:04,735 --> 01:06:05,736
Well done.

1085
01:06:05,815 --> 01:06:06,815
SCOTT: Wait a minute.

1086
01:06:06,855 --> 01:06:08,266
Did you just compliment me?

1087
01:06:08,335 --> 01:06:10,815
- He did, didn't he?
- Kind of sounded like he did.

1088
01:06:11,295 --> 01:06:12,785
(BEEPING SOFTLY)

1089
01:06:12,855 --> 01:06:14,141
I was good, wasn't I?

(SCOFFS)

1091
01:06:15,695 --> 01:06:19,336
Hey, how about the fact that
I fought an Avenger and didn't die?

1092
01:06:19,415 --> 01:06:21,895
Let us not dwell on the past.

1093
01:06:21,975 --> 01:06:24,103
We gotta finish our planning.

1094
01:06:26,454 --> 01:06:28,138
HOPE: Don't mind him.

1095
01:06:28,654 --> 01:06:29,655
You did good.

1096
01:06:36,534 --> 01:06:37,820
Darren.

1097
01:06:40,814 --> 01:06:42,464
How the hell did you get in here?

1098
01:06:43,694 --> 01:06:45,935
You left the front door open, Hank.

1099
01:06:46,334 --> 01:06:47,334
It's official.

1100
01:06:47,374 --> 01:06:48,535
You're old.

1101
01:06:49,094 --> 01:06:50,255
The plans.

1102
01:06:51,654 --> 01:06:53,258
He will kill him.

1103
01:06:56,494 --> 01:06:59,179
Well, to what do I owe this pleasure?

1104
01:07:00,214 --> 01:07:01,704
I have good news.

1105
01:07:01,774 --> 01:07:03,014
Really?

1106
01:07:03,854 --> 01:07:04,855
What's that?

1107
01:07:05,454 --> 01:07:10,096
Pym Tech, the company you created,

1108
01:07:10,174 --> 01:07:13,974
is about to become one of the most
profitable operations in the world.

1109
01:07:14,054 --> 01:07:17,820
We're anticipating $15 billion in sales,
tomorrow alone.

1110
01:07:24,414 --> 01:07:25,540
You're welcome.

1111
01:07:29,894 --> 01:07:32,374
I know this is odd,
but I'd like you to be there.

1112
01:07:33,054 --> 01:07:35,056
This is my moment.
I want you to see it.

1113
01:07:36,294 --> 01:07:37,864
Sure, Darren. Yeah, sure.

1114
01:07:37,934 --> 01:07:39,220
I'll be there.

1115
01:07:56,294 --> 01:07:57,739
What did you see in me?

1116
01:07:58,934 --> 01:08:00,345
I don't know what you mean.

1117
01:08:01,254 --> 01:08:03,860
All those years ago, you picked me.

1118
01:08:03,934 --> 01:08:05,424
What did you see?

1119
01:08:07,614 --> 01:08:09,378
I saw myself.

1120
01:08:09,974 --> 01:08:12,375
Then why did you push me away?

1121
01:08:13,934 --> 01:08:17,256
Because I saw too much of myself.

1122
01:08:28,134 --> 01:08:29,545
HOPE: <i>He knows. He's baiting you.</i>

1123
01:08:29,614 --> 01:08:31,343
We have to call it off.

1124
01:08:31,414 --> 01:08:32,575
We're all taking risks.

1125
01:08:32,654 --> 01:08:33,985
What if he saw me here?

1126
01:08:34,054 --> 01:08:35,385
He didn't. There's no way.

1127
01:08:35,454 --> 01:08:37,821
- How do you know that?
- (CELL PHONE RINGING)

1128
01:08:45,294 --> 01:08:46,580
Darren, hi.

1129
01:08:46,694 --> 01:08:49,504
Hope, where are you right now?

1130
01:08:50,134 --> 01:08:51,340
I'm at home. Why?

1131
01:08:51,414 --> 01:08:53,178
<i>I just saw Hank.</i>

1132
01:08:53,254 --> 01:08:55,063
<i>I still get nothing but contempt from him.</i>

1133
01:08:55,134 --> 01:08:58,695
Don't let him rile you up.
He's just a senile old man.

1134
01:08:58,774 --> 01:09:01,220
<i>We need to start everyone working
around the clock.</i>

1135
01:09:01,334 --> 01:09:03,143
<i>Get the assembly line up and running.</i>

1136
01:09:03,214 --> 01:09:04,500
<i>And I'm tripling security.</i>

1137
01:09:04,574 --> 01:09:06,576
Full sensors at all entrances

1138
01:09:06,654 --> 01:09:10,056
and exterior air vents
fitted with steel micro-mesh.

1139
01:09:10,174 --> 01:09:11,778
Great. Good idea.

1140
01:09:11,854 --> 01:09:16,178
<i>Thank you, Hope.
I'm so lucky to have you on my team.</i>

1141
01:09:18,614 --> 01:09:23,097
He's tripling security.
He's lost his mind, and he's onto you.

1142
01:09:23,174 --> 01:09:25,142
But he is not onto you.

1143
01:09:25,214 --> 01:09:27,581
He's adding full body scanners
to all entrances

1144
01:09:27,694 --> 01:09:29,423
and closing exterior vents.

1145
01:09:29,494 --> 01:09:31,417
How are we gonna get Scott inside?

1146
01:09:32,934 --> 01:09:34,459
The water main.

1147
01:09:35,574 --> 01:09:37,497
You can't add security to a water main.

1148
01:09:37,574 --> 01:09:39,895
The pressure is too strong,
but if we can decrease it,

1149
01:09:39,974 --> 01:09:41,180
that's how I get in.

1150
01:09:41,254 --> 01:09:43,461
Somebody would have to reach
the building's control center

1151
01:09:43,534 --> 01:09:44,899
to change the water pressure.

1152
01:09:44,974 --> 01:09:47,705
Hank and I will be beside Cross.
How are we supposed to do that?

1153
01:09:47,774 --> 01:09:49,299
So we expand our team.

1154
01:09:49,894 --> 01:09:50,895
What do we need?

1155
01:09:50,974 --> 01:09:54,376
A fake security guard on the inside
to de-pressurize the water system,

1156
01:09:54,454 --> 01:09:56,297
somebody else to hack in
to the power supply

1157
01:09:56,374 --> 01:09:57,785
and kill the laser grid,

1158
01:09:57,854 --> 01:10:00,175
and a getaway guy.

1159
01:10:00,254 --> 01:10:04,225
No, no. No, no, no.
Not those three Wombats. No way.

LUIS: Thank you for the coffee, ma'am.

1161
01:10:06,374 --> 01:10:09,981
It's not too often that you rob a place
and then get welcomed back.

1162
01:10:10,054 --> 01:10:11,943
(CHUCKLES)
Because we just robbed you.

1163

You know that he was arrested
for stealing a smoothie machine, right?

1164
01:10:17,134 --> 01:10:18,420
Two smoothie machines.

1165
01:10:18,534 --> 01:10:20,104
Are you sure they can handle this?

1166
01:10:20,174 --> 01:10:21,585
Oh, we can handle it.
We're professionals.

1167
01:10:21,654 --> 01:10:25,261
You'll forgive us if we're not
instilled with confidence.

1168
01:10:25,374 --> 01:10:28,025
Well, hey, everybody just kick back
and relax a little bit, man.

1169
01:10:28,094 --> 01:10:29,425
We know our business.

1170
01:10:29,494 --> 01:10:31,861
We broke into this spooky-ass house,
didn't we?

1171
01:10:31,934 --> 01:10:33,379
I let you.

1172
01:10:33,454 --> 01:10:36,742
Well, one could say that
I let you let me.

1173
01:10:36,814 --> 01:10:40,136
- Look, it's okay. They can handle this.
- Yeah, we can handle it.

01:10:40,214 --> 01:10:41,978
- SCOTT: You got their credentials?
- He's in the system.

- I'm in the system?
- You're in the system.

1176
01:10:44,614 --> 01:10:45,820
The system?

1177
01:10:45,894 --> 01:10:48,181
Yeah, we're doomed.

1178
01:10:48,254 --> 01:10:49,301
SCOTT: All right.

1179
01:10:49,374 --> 01:10:51,058
There's something
you guys need to see.

When you get to this corner,

1181
01:10:53,054 --> 01:10:55,819
there's gonna be three offices

Whoa! That's so cool, bro!

1184
01:11:01,694 --> 01:11:04,379
Now, look,
this is gonna get weird, all right?

1185
01:11:04,454 --> 01:11:07,697
It's pretty freaky, but it's safe.
There's no reason to be scared.

1186
01:11:07,774 --> 01:11:09,105
Oh, no, no. Daddy don't get scared.

1187
01:11:09,174 --> 01:11:11,017
- Really?
- Yeah.

1188
01:11:11,094 --> 01:11:12,255
Good.

That's witchcraft.

Wow, that's amazing.

1193
01:11:24,414 --> 01:11:25,904
That's like some David Copperfield shit.

1194

How'd you do that, bro?

Look at your shoulder.

Ahhh!

1199
01:11:33,334 --> 01:11:34,779
Get off! Get off!

Daddy didn't get scared!

and Hank explained the science
of the suit to them.

1206
01:11:49,334 --> 01:11:51,257
No, please don't.

1207
01:11:51,334 --> 01:11:53,780
We're all doing this for reasons
much bigger than any one of us.

1208
01:11:53,854 --> 01:11:57,700
I'm just glad that you might have
a slight chance of maybe pulling this off.

Hey, thank you, you know,
for that pep talk.

1210
01:12:00,934 --> 01:12:03,619
You know, the honest truth is,
I actually went from despising you

1211
01:12:03,694 --> 01:12:05,298
to almost liking you.

1212
01:12:05,374 --> 01:12:07,103
You really should write poetry.
