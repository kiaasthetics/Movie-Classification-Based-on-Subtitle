hopeless plan.

723
00:41:35,098 --> 00:41:38,702
Preparing a dinner, designing a gown
for her, giving her a suite...

724
00:41:38,811 --> 00:41:40,350
in the east wing.

725
00:41:40,442 --> 00:41:41,890
You gave her a bedroom?

726
00:41:41,964 --> 00:41:43,741
No, no, no.
He gave her a bedroom.

727
00:41:43,814 --> 00:41:44,814
This is true.

728
00:41:44,839 --> 00:41:46,650
But, if this girl is the one
who can break the spell,

729
00:41:46,674 --> 00:41:49,538
then maybe you could stop by
using dinner to charm her.

730
00:41:49,681 --> 00:41:51,655
- Good thinking, Cogsworth!
- What?

731
00:41:51,731 --> 00:41:54,933
That's the most ridiculous idea
I've ever heard! Charm the prisoner?

732
00:41:55,174 --> 00:41:58,030
But you must try, Master.
With every passing day...

733
00:41:58,171 --> 00:41:59,530
we become less human.

734
00:41:59,629 --> 00:42:02,155
She's the daughter of a common thief.

735
00:42:02,225 --> 00:42:03,801
What kind of person do you think
that makes her?

736
00:42:03,825 --> 00:42:08,171
Ow, you can't judge people by who
their father is, now can you?

737
00:42:12,182 --> 00:42:13,780
You'll join me for dinner.

738
00:42:13,920 --> 00:42:15,140
That's not a request.

739
00:42:15,232 --> 00:42:16,237
Gently, Master.

740
00:42:16,422 --> 00:42:17,827
The girl lost her father

741
00:42:17,958 --> 00:42:19,905
and her freedom in one day.

742
00:42:20,022 --> 00:42:22,858
Yes, the poor thing is probably
in there, scare to death.

743
00:42:22,932 --> 00:42:24,132
MRS. POTTS: Exactly.

744
00:42:31,981 --> 00:42:33,262
Just a minute.

745
00:42:33,321 --> 00:42:37,136
You see? There she is.
Now remember, be gentle.

746
00:42:37,398 --> 00:42:38,996
- Kind!
- Charming!

747
00:42:39,021 --> 00:42:40,051
Sweet!

748
00:42:40,076 --> 00:42:43,950
And when she opens the door,
give her a dashing smile.

749
00:42:44,120 --> 00:42:46,511
Come, come, show me the smile.

750
00:42:46,781 --> 00:42:48,832
- Oh, my God!
- Oh, no.

751
00:42:53,401 --> 00:42:55,643
Will you join me for dinner?

752
00:42:58,282 --> 00:43:01,964
You've taken me as your prisoner, and
now you want to have dinner with me?

753
00:43:02,608 --> 00:43:04,105
Are you insane?

754
00:43:04,566 --> 00:43:06,565
- (GRUNTING)
- Uh-oh. He's losing it.

755
00:43:06,642 --> 00:43:08,176
Oh, dear.

756
00:43:10,379 --> 00:43:12,621
I told you to join me
for dinner!

757
00:43:12,701 --> 00:43:14,121
I told you, no!

758
00:43:15,615 --> 00:43:16,871
What, what time is it?

759
00:43:16,922 --> 00:43:17,922
What's happening?

760
00:43:18,210 --> 00:43:20,629
I'd starved before I ever
ate with you.

761
00:43:20,967 --> 00:43:22,340
Well, be my guest!

762
00:43:22,555 --> 00:43:24,324
Go ahed and starve!

763
00:43:26,038 --> 00:43:27,434
If she doesn't eat with me,

764
00:43:27,527 --> 00:43:29,434
then she doesn't eat at all.

765
00:43:29,638 --> 00:43:31,035
Idiot!

766
00:43:32,370 --> 00:43:35,090
You can't talk to us like that.
I forbid it.

767
00:43:36,604 --> 00:43:37,738
Am I too late?

768
00:43:37,809 --> 00:43:40,137
Shame, I was ready enough
to tell him off this time.

769

That most of the troubles
seem less troubling,

That was a very brave thing
you did for your father, deary.

802
00:46:11,663 --> 00:46:12,849
Yes.

803
00:46:12,922 --> 00:46:14,794
We all think so.

804
00:46:15,048 --> 00:46:16,412
I'm worried about him.

805
00:46:16,759 --> 00:46:19,037
He's never been on his own.

806
00:46:19,143 --> 00:46:20,742
Cheer up, my puppet.

with me, she doesn't eat at all".

in anger.

to listen.

813
00:46:36,056 --> 00:46:37,056

No, you don't!

If the Master finds that you buy and
order them... He will blame me!

Yes, I will make sure of it.

818
00:46:46,506 --> 00:46:49,807
But, did you see us stand up to win?
I am telling you, this girl is the one.

819
00:46:50,018 --> 00:46:52,122
They must fall in love,
if we are to be human again.

820

And how can they fall in love if
she stays in her room?

Ay, Chapeau, you missed
this spot.
