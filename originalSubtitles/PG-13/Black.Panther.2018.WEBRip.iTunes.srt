1
00:00:05,005 --> 00:00:06,089
Baba...

2
00:00:06,256 --> 00:00:07,466
Yes, my son.

3
00:00:07,633 --> 00:00:09,051
Tell me a story.

4
00:00:10,093 --> 00:00:11,303
Which one?

5
00:00:11,637 --> 00:00:13,555
The story of home.

6
00:00:14,806 --> 00:00:17,309
Millions of years ago...

7
00:00:17,476 --> 00:00:20,062
a meteorite made of vibranium...

8
00:00:20,229 --> 00:00:22,564
the strongest substance
in the universe...

9
00:00:22,731 --> 00:00:24,650
struck the continent of Africa...

10
00:00:26,818 --> 00:00:29,696
affecting the plant life around it.

11
00:00:29,863 --> 00:00:31,865
And when the time of man came...

12
00:00:32,031 --> 00:00:35,869
five tribes settled on it
and called it Wakanda.

13
00:00:38,580 --> 00:00:41,166
The tribes lived in constant war
with each other...

14
00:00:41,333 --> 00:00:43,502
until a warrior shaman...

15
00:00:43,669 --> 00:00:46,630
received a vision
from the Panther Goddess Bast...

16
00:00:46,797 --> 00:00:49,842
who led him to the Heart-Shaped Herb...

17
00:00:50,509 --> 00:00:56,348
a plant that granted him superhuman
strength, speed and instincts.

18
00:00:56,515 --> 00:00:57,933
The warrior became king...

19
00:00:58,100 --> 00:01:00,477
and the first Black Panther...

20
00:01:00,644 --> 00:01:03,230
the protector of Wakanda.

21
00:01:03,397 --> 00:01:06,233
Four tribes agreed to live
under the king's rule...

22
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:10,737
but the Jabari Tribe isolated themselves
in the mountains.

23
00:01:11,530 --> 00:01:14,533
The Wakandans used vibranium
to develop technology...

24
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:17,953
more advanced than any other nation.

25
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:19,788
But as Wakanda thrived...

26
00:01:19,955 --> 00:01:23,375
the world around it descended further
into chaos.

27
00:01:27,296 --> 00:01:28,755
To keep vibranium safe...

28
00:01:28,922 --> 00:01:31,884
the Wakandans vowed
to hide in plain sight...

29
00:01:32,801 --> 00:01:36,805
keeping the truth of their power
from the outside world.

30
00:01:38,307 --> 00:01:40,184
And we still hide, Baba?

31
00:01:41,143 --> 00:01:42,227
Yes.

32
00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:44,104
Why?

33
00:01:54,948 --> 00:01:56,325
-Lucky shot!
-That ain't lucky!

34
00:01:56,491 --> 00:01:57,826
Whatever!
Get outta here!

35
00:01:57,993 --> 00:01:58,869
Check up.

36
00:01:59,036 --> 00:02:01,205
Pick your man up! He open.

37
00:02:02,372 --> 00:02:03,415
Where you at?

38
00:02:03,582 --> 00:02:05,375
Let's go, let's go, let's go.

39
00:02:05,542 --> 00:02:06,710
Pass! Pass!

40
00:02:06,877 --> 00:02:08,002
-Got you, E.
-E, hurry up!

41
00:02:08,169 --> 00:02:09,670
Watch me get this.

42
00:02:10,172 --> 00:02:12,758
Tim Hardaway style.
That's what I call it, baby.

43
00:02:12,925 --> 00:02:13,842
Come on.

44
00:02:14,009 --> 00:02:15,385
What you got?
You ain't got nothing.

45
00:02:16,011 --> 00:02:19,014
Hey, look, if we get in and out quick,
won't be no worries.

46
00:02:19,181 --> 00:02:21,141
You in the van,
come in through from the west.

47
00:02:21,308 --> 00:02:23,727
Come around the corner. Land right here.

48
00:02:23,894 --> 00:02:25,521
Me and the twins are pulling up
right here.

49
00:02:25,687 --> 00:02:27,856
We're leaving this car behind, okay?
We come this...

50
00:02:32,236 --> 00:02:33,195
Hide the straps.

51
00:02:41,578 --> 00:02:43,580
Yo, is it the Feds?

52
00:02:46,458 --> 00:02:47,584
No.

53
00:02:59,513 --> 00:03:02,516
It's these two Grace Jones-looking chicks.

54
00:03:03,100 --> 00:03:04,226
They're holding spears.

55
00:03:04,810 --> 00:03:05,811
Open it.

56
00:03:06,562 --> 00:03:07,688
You serious?

57
00:03:08,272 --> 00:03:10,399
They won't knock again.

58
00:03:27,875 --> 00:03:29,251
Who are you?

59
00:03:29,418 --> 00:03:31,461
Prince N'Jobu, son of Azzuri.

60
00:03:31,670 --> 00:03:35,674
Prove to me you are one of us.

61
00:03:43,265 --> 00:03:44,474
My King.

62
00:03:47,144 --> 00:03:48,478
Leave us.

63
00:03:48,645 --> 00:03:51,648
This is James. I trust him with my life.
He stays...

64
00:03:51,815 --> 00:03:53,942
with your permission, King T'Chaka.

65
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:56,528
As you wish.

66
00:03:56,695 --> 00:03:57,821
At ease.

67
00:04:08,665 --> 00:04:10,375
Come, baby brother.

68
00:04:10,542 --> 00:04:12,252
Let me see how you are holding up.

69
00:04:21,261 --> 00:04:22,429
You look strong.

70
00:04:22,596 --> 00:04:25,599
Glory to Bast, I am in good health.
How is home?

71
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:29,895
Not so good.

72
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:31,855
Baby brother.

73
00:04:32,022 --> 00:04:33,398
There has been an attack.

74
00:04:33,815 --> 00:04:35,025
This man...

75
00:04:37,069 --> 00:04:38,111
Ulysses Klaue...

76
00:04:39,488 --> 00:04:41,532
stole a quarter ton of vibranium
from us...

77
00:04:41,698 --> 00:04:43,951
and triggered a bomb at the border
to escape.

78
00:04:46,245 --> 00:04:47,746
Many lives were lost.

79
00:04:49,122 --> 00:04:51,124
He knew where we hid the vibranium...

80
00:04:51,291 --> 00:04:52,835
and how to strike.

81
00:04:53,460 --> 00:04:55,921
He had someone on the inside.

82
00:04:56,797 --> 00:04:58,090
Why are you here?

83
00:04:58,590 --> 00:05:01,552
Because I want you
to look me in the eyes...

84
00:05:01,718 --> 00:05:04,638
and tell me why you betrayed Wakanda.

85
00:05:04,805 --> 00:05:07,432
I did no such thing.

86
00:05:10,018 --> 00:05:11,395
Tell him who you are.

87
00:05:11,562 --> 00:05:13,897
Zuri, son of Badu...

88
00:05:14,064 --> 00:05:14,731
What?

89
00:05:20,737 --> 00:05:23,282
James. James, you lied to me?

90
00:05:23,448 --> 00:05:24,825
Leave him.

91
00:05:24,992 --> 00:05:26,368
You were Wakandan this whole time?

92
00:05:26,535 --> 00:05:27,536
-You betrayed Wakanda!
-How could you lie to me like...

93
00:05:27,703 --> 00:05:29,663
Stand down.

94
00:05:32,666 --> 00:05:36,545
Did you think that you were the only spy
we sent here?

95
00:05:48,557 --> 00:05:50,767
Prince N'Jobu...

96
00:05:50,934 --> 00:05:52,561
you will return home at once...

97
00:05:52,728 --> 00:05:54,605
where you will face the Council...

98
00:05:54,771 --> 00:05:57,441
and inform them of your crimes.

99
00:06:00,652 --> 00:06:01,904
Check up!

100
00:06:03,655 --> 00:06:05,616
Guard your man, guard your man!

101
00:06:07,075 --> 00:06:07,910
Yo.

102
00:06:58,043 --> 00:07:02,840
The tiny nation of Wakanda is mourning
the death of its monarch, King T'Chaka.

103
00:07:03,006 --> 00:07:05,509
The beloved ruler
was one of many confirmed dead...

104
00:07:05,676 --> 00:07:08,512
after a terrorist attack
at the United Nations a week ago.

105
00:07:08,679 --> 00:07:11,849
The suspect has since been apprehended.

106
00:07:12,015 --> 00:07:14,184
Though it remains one of the poorest
countries in the world...

107
00:07:14,351 --> 00:07:16,103
fortified by mountain ranges...

108
00:07:16,270 --> 00:07:17,896
and an impenetrable rainforest...

109
00:07:18,063 --> 00:07:22,901
Wakanda does not engage
in international trade or accept aid.

110
00:07:23,068 --> 00:07:24,319
The succession of the throne...

111
00:07:24,486 --> 00:07:27,072
is expected to fall to the oldest
of the king's two children...

112
00:07:27,239 --> 00:07:28,574
Prince T'Challa.

113
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:31,451
My Prince...

114
00:07:31,618 --> 00:07:33,537
coming up on them now.

115
00:07:56,101 --> 00:07:58,979
No need, Okoye.
I can handle this alone.

116
00:08:05,402 --> 00:08:08,155
I will get Nakia out
as quickly as possible.

117
00:08:12,117 --> 00:08:14,411
Just don't freeze when you see her.

118
00:08:14,578 --> 00:08:16,121
What are you talking about?

119
00:08:17,164 --> 00:08:18,916
I never freeze.

120
00:08:34,972 --> 00:08:35,890
What's going on?

121
00:08:36,058 --> 00:08:39,602
It's the car. It lost power.
It won't start.

122
00:08:40,270 --> 00:08:41,897
The car no start.

123
00:08:42,313 --> 00:08:43,232
What happened?

124
00:08:43,398 --> 00:08:44,733
The engine failed.

125
00:08:46,151 --> 00:08:47,402
Ours, too.

126
00:08:51,949 --> 00:08:53,700
What is it, Captain?

127
00:09:02,167 --> 00:09:04,002
Defense positions.

128
00:09:04,711 --> 00:09:06,088
Defense positions.

129
00:09:06,255 --> 00:09:07,589
Are we under attack?

130
00:09:07,756 --> 00:09:09,174
Defense positions.

131
00:09:11,009 --> 00:09:12,469
Get around to the side.

132
00:09:13,178 --> 00:09:14,513
Defense positions.

133
00:09:17,099 --> 00:09:18,851
Hey. Defense positions!

134
00:09:21,728 --> 00:09:22,896
No games.

135
00:09:44,001 --> 00:09:45,419
What do you see?

136
00:09:53,886 --> 00:09:55,262
Come in. Come in.

137
00:09:56,054 --> 00:09:57,472
Over there! Look back!

138
00:09:58,307 --> 00:09:59,308
Watch out!

139
00:10:25,167 --> 00:10:26,543
T'Challa, no!

140
00:10:27,336 --> 00:10:28,962
This one's just a boy.

141
00:10:30,881 --> 00:10:32,549
He got kidnapped as well.

142
00:10:32,716 --> 00:10:33,550
Nakia...

143
00:10:37,971 --> 00:10:39,139
I...

144
00:10:41,517 --> 00:10:42,851
-I wanted...
-Hey!

145
00:10:43,018 --> 00:10:45,687
I have her!
Don't move! I will shoot!

146
00:10:46,063 --> 00:10:47,606
I will shoot her right now.

147
00:10:55,322 --> 00:10:56,365
You froze.

148
00:11:01,036 --> 00:11:04,206
Why are you here?
You've ruined my mission.

149
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:07,584
My father is dead, Nakia.

150
00:11:08,961 --> 00:11:11,755
I will be crowned king tomorrow.

151
00:11:12,881 --> 00:11:14,800
And I wish for you to be there.

152
00:11:21,849 --> 00:11:23,600
Carry yourselves home now.

153
00:11:23,767 --> 00:11:24,601
Thank you.

154
00:11:24,768 --> 00:11:26,270
And take the boy.
Get him to his people.

155
00:11:26,436 --> 00:11:27,729
Thank you oh.

156
00:11:35,487 --> 00:11:37,614
You will speak nothing of this day.

157
00:11:38,115 --> 00:11:39,116
Yes.

158
00:11:39,992 --> 00:11:40,993
Thank you.

159
00:11:42,035 --> 00:11:43,036
Thank you.

160
00:12:18,363 --> 00:12:19,781
Sister Nakia...

161
00:12:20,157 --> 00:12:21,742
My Prince...

162
00:12:22,659 --> 00:12:24,161
we are home.

163
00:13:00,197 --> 00:13:02,074
This never gets old.

164
00:13:57,254 --> 00:13:58,213
Queen Mother...

165
00:13:59,006 --> 00:14:00,174
Princess...

166
00:14:00,549 --> 00:14:02,259
My comfort for your loss.

167
00:14:02,426 --> 00:14:03,468
Thank you, Nakia.

168
00:14:03,635 --> 00:14:06,263
It is so good to have you back with us.

169
00:14:07,514 --> 00:14:09,808
Take her to the River Province
to prepare her for the ceremony.

170
00:14:09,975 --> 00:14:11,143
Yes, General.

171
00:14:20,319 --> 00:14:21,445
Did he freeze?

172
00:14:21,945 --> 00:14:23,906
Like an antelope in headlights.

173
00:14:25,199 --> 00:14:26,533
Are you finished?

174
00:14:31,246 --> 00:14:35,501
So surprised my little sister came
to see me off before our big day.

175
00:14:35,667 --> 00:14:36,543
You wish!

176
00:14:36,710 --> 00:14:39,505
I'm here for the EMP beads.
I've developed an update.

177
00:14:39,671 --> 00:14:41,840
Update? No. It worked perfectly.

178
00:14:42,007 --> 00:14:43,467
How many times do I have to teach you?

179
00:14:43,634 --> 00:14:46,637
Just because something works
doesn't mean that it cannot be improved.

180
00:14:46,803 --> 00:14:48,972
You are teaching me? What do you know?

181
00:14:49,932 --> 00:14:51,266
More than you.

182
00:14:52,267 --> 00:14:54,937
I can't wait to see what kind of update
you make...

183
00:14:55,103 --> 00:14:57,022
to your ceremonial outfit.

184
00:14:58,524 --> 00:14:59,608
Shuri!

185
00:15:00,275 --> 00:15:01,401
Sorry, Mother!

186
00:15:02,277 --> 00:15:04,238
How are you feeling today, Mama?

187
00:15:04,613 --> 00:15:05,781
Proud.

188
00:15:06,448 --> 00:15:10,536
Your father and I would talk
about this day all the time.

189
00:15:12,329 --> 00:15:14,081
He is with us...

190
00:15:14,248 --> 00:15:17,292
and it is your time to be king.

191
00:15:35,769 --> 00:15:37,104
Good morning.

192
00:15:38,689 --> 00:15:39,773
How can I help you?

193
00:15:39,940 --> 00:15:43,068
I was just checking out these artifacts.
They tell me you're the expert.

194
00:15:43,569 --> 00:15:45,445
You could say that.

195
00:15:46,989 --> 00:15:48,282
They're beautiful.

196
00:15:50,409 --> 00:15:51,910
Where's this one from?

197
00:15:52,077 --> 00:15:53,537
The Bobo Ashanti tribe...

198
00:15:53,704 --> 00:15:54,955
present day Ghana...

199
00:15:55,122 --> 00:15:56,206
19th century.

200
00:15:56,373 --> 00:15:57,374
For real?

201
00:15:58,625 --> 00:16:00,377
What about this one?

202
00:16:02,212 --> 00:16:04,173
That one's from the Edo people
of Benin...

203
00:16:04,339 --> 00:16:06,216
16th century.

204
00:16:09,887 --> 00:16:12,306
Now, tell me about this one.

205
00:16:13,724 --> 00:16:16,268
Also from Benin, seventh century.

206
00:16:16,768 --> 00:16:18,437
Fula tribe, I believe.

207
00:16:19,646 --> 00:16:20,981
Nah.

208
00:16:21,565 --> 00:16:22,816
I beg your pardon?

209
00:16:22,983 --> 00:16:26,111
It was taken by British soldiers in Benin,
but it's from Wakanda.

210
00:16:26,278 --> 00:16:27,779
And it's made out of vibranium.

211
00:16:30,824 --> 00:16:33,118
Don't trip.
I'mma take it off your hands for you.

212
00:16:34,536 --> 00:16:36,496
These items aren't for sale.

213
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:39,249
How do you think your ancestors
got these?

214
00:16:39,416 --> 00:16:40,918
You think they paid a fair price?

215
00:16:41,084 --> 00:16:43,253
Or did they take it,
like they took everything else?

216
00:16:43,629 --> 00:16:46,882
Sir, I'm going to have to ask you
to leave.

217
00:16:47,049 --> 00:16:50,093
You got all this security in here
watching me ever since I walked in.

218
00:16:50,260 --> 00:16:52,721
But you ain't checking
for what you put in your body.

219
00:16:53,847 --> 00:16:56,725
All right, mate. Let's have it.
Come on, mate. Time.

220
00:16:56,892 --> 00:16:58,352
I think she might not
be feeling too good.

221
00:16:59,311 --> 00:17:00,896
Somebody get some help!
Come here!

222
00:17:01,063 --> 00:17:03,774
Call a doctor, please!
Please, somebody, come help!

223
00:17:03,941 --> 00:17:05,442
Medical emergency right away
in the West African Exhibit,

224
00:17:05,526 --> 00:17:06,527
please, right away.

225
00:17:06,609 --> 00:17:07,528
Look out.

226
00:17:07,694 --> 00:17:10,321
Step back, please. Step back.
Thank you.

227
00:17:10,489 --> 00:17:13,200
Coming through over there.
Medics coming through.

228
00:17:14,117 --> 00:17:15,702
I'm gonna take a break.

229
00:17:19,414 --> 00:17:21,083
Let's give the lady some space, please.

230
00:17:21,250 --> 00:17:23,669
Step back, please, gents.
Step back, please.

231
00:17:27,589 --> 00:17:29,424
Hey, come here.

232
00:17:29,591 --> 00:17:32,469
Come here. It's okay.

233
00:17:33,136 --> 00:17:36,348
You can go, but just don't tell anyone,
all right?

234
00:17:42,563 --> 00:17:44,022
Bro, why you ain't just shoot him
right here?

235
00:17:44,189 --> 00:17:46,233
Because it's better to leave
the crime scene more spread out.

236
00:17:47,401 --> 00:17:49,111
Makes us look like amateurs.

237
00:18:04,585 --> 00:18:08,755
Now then, let's see if you know
what you're talking about.

238
00:18:15,804 --> 00:18:17,639
That's just a taste.

239
00:18:33,864 --> 00:18:36,366
-You're gonna be a rich boy.
-You better sell that quick.

240
00:18:36,533 --> 00:18:38,160
It's already sold!

241
00:18:38,994 --> 00:18:40,996
Whatever you try,
the Wakandans'll probably show up.

242
00:18:41,163 --> 00:18:43,999
That'll make my day.
I can kill two birds with one stone.

243
00:18:46,502 --> 00:18:48,462
You're not telling me
that's vibranium, too?

244
00:18:48,629 --> 00:18:50,422
Nah, I'm just feeling it.

245
00:19:31,797 --> 00:19:33,090
Onward!

246
00:19:33,423 --> 00:19:34,508
Onward!

247
00:20:52,544 --> 00:20:54,087
I, Zuri...

248
00:20:54,796 --> 00:20:56,381
son of Badu...

249
00:20:56,673 --> 00:20:58,300
give to you...

250
00:20:58,467 --> 00:21:00,636
Prince T'Challa...

251
00:21:00,802 --> 00:21:02,513
the Black Panther!

252
00:21:07,476 --> 00:21:09,019
The prince...

253
00:21:09,186 --> 00:21:13,815
will now have the strength
of the Black Panther...

254
00:21:13,982 --> 00:21:16,235
stripped away.

255
00:21:48,767 --> 00:21:50,018
Praise the ancestors.

256
00:21:50,185 --> 00:21:51,520
Praise the ancestors.

257
00:21:51,728 --> 00:21:55,691
Victory in ritual combat...

258
00:21:55,858 --> 00:21:59,403
comes by yield or death.

259
00:21:59,570 --> 00:22:03,115
If any tribe wishes to put forth
a warrior...

260
00:22:03,282 --> 00:22:05,117
I now offer...

261
00:22:05,784 --> 00:22:08,745
a path to the throne.

262
00:22:12,541 --> 00:22:17,171
The Merchant Tribe
will not challenge today.

263
00:22:19,131 --> 00:22:23,260
The Border Tribe
will not challenge today.

264
00:22:25,971 --> 00:22:28,974
The River Tribe
will not challenge today.

265
00:22:31,226 --> 00:22:33,937
The Mining Tribe
will not challenge today.

266
00:22:34,104 --> 00:22:37,024
Is there any member of a royal blood...

267
00:22:37,858 --> 00:22:41,111
who wishes to challenge for the throne?

268
00:22:44,865 --> 00:22:47,701
This corset is really uncomfortable...

269
00:22:47,868 --> 00:22:51,121
so could we all just wrap it up
and go home?

270
00:22:51,747 --> 00:22:52,789
Mother!

271
00:23:17,648 --> 00:23:19,691
-Are they Jabari?
-Yes.

272
00:23:28,659 --> 00:23:31,411
M'Baku, what are you doing here?

273
00:23:33,288 --> 00:23:35,541
It's challenge day.

274
00:23:40,754 --> 00:23:42,381
We have watched...

275
00:23:43,215 --> 00:23:45,509
and listened from the mountains!

276
00:23:45,676 --> 00:23:47,636
We have watched with disgust...

277
00:23:47,803 --> 00:23:52,766
as your technological advancements
have been overseen by a child!

278
00:23:56,395 --> 00:23:58,814
Who scoffs at tradition!

279
00:23:59,606 --> 00:24:04,486
And now you want to hand the nation
over to this prince...

280
00:24:05,279 --> 00:24:10,617
who could not keep his own father safe.

281
00:24:15,581 --> 00:24:17,291
We will not have it.

282
00:24:17,457 --> 00:24:21,545
I said, we will not have it, oh!

283
00:24:21,712 --> 00:24:24,214
I, M'Baku...

284
00:24:25,674 --> 00:24:27,467
leader of the Jabari...

285
00:24:27,634 --> 00:24:31,930
I accept your challenge, M'Baku.

286
00:24:33,223 --> 00:24:35,142
Glory to Hanuman.

287
00:24:53,202 --> 00:24:54,494
Jabari!

288
00:24:56,121 --> 00:24:57,456
Dora Milaje!

289
00:24:57,623 --> 00:24:58,540
Onward!

290
00:25:05,714 --> 00:25:08,467
Let the challenge begin!

291
00:25:23,857 --> 00:25:24,858
Stand up!

292
00:25:34,701 --> 00:25:35,827
Come!

293
00:25:44,503 --> 00:25:45,420
T'Challa!

294
00:25:50,509 --> 00:25:52,094
Where is your god now?

295
00:26:03,355 --> 00:26:04,022
Yes!

296
00:26:11,864 --> 00:26:13,657
No powers.

297
00:26:13,991 --> 00:26:15,450
No claws.

298
00:26:16,869 --> 00:26:18,412
No special suit, oh!

299
00:26:18,579 --> 00:26:21,623
Just a boy not fit to lead!

300
00:26:21,790 --> 00:26:24,835
Show him who you are!

301
00:26:41,226 --> 00:26:43,061
I am Prince T'Challa...

302
00:26:43,228 --> 00:26:44,813
son of King T'Chaka!

303
00:26:44,980 --> 00:26:46,607
You can do this, T'Challa!

304
00:27:00,412 --> 00:27:01,163
Yes!

305
00:27:02,247 --> 00:27:02,956
Come on!

306
00:27:03,123 --> 00:27:05,292
Yield! Don't make me kill you.

307
00:27:05,459 --> 00:27:07,044
I would rather die!

308
00:27:10,464 --> 00:27:11,465
T'Challa!

309
00:27:12,674 --> 00:27:13,425
T'Challa!

310
00:27:14,426 --> 00:27:15,260
T'Challa!

311
00:27:16,428 --> 00:27:17,346
T'Challa!

312
00:27:18,347 --> 00:27:19,181
T'Challa!

313
00:27:19,348 --> 00:27:20,474
You have fought with honor!

314
00:27:20,641 --> 00:27:23,227
Now yield!
Your people need you.

315
00:27:23,393 --> 00:27:24,394
T'Challa!

316
00:27:24,895 --> 00:27:25,729
T'Challa!

317
00:27:25,896 --> 00:27:27,064
Yield, man!

318
00:27:27,231 --> 00:27:28,482
T'Challa!

319
00:27:29,066 --> 00:27:29,900
T'Challa!

320
00:27:31,735 --> 00:27:34,238
Yes! Yes!

321
00:27:55,801 --> 00:27:58,387
I now present to you...

322
00:27:58,554 --> 00:28:00,889
King T'Challa...

323
00:28:02,599 --> 00:28:05,477
the Black Panther.

324
00:28:11,483 --> 00:28:12,609
Zuri.

325
00:28:13,527 --> 00:28:14,736
My King.

326
00:28:25,414 --> 00:28:27,040
Wakanda forever!

327
00:28:27,207 --> 00:28:29,293
Wakanda forever!

328
00:29:01,575 --> 00:29:03,243
Allow the Heart-Shaped Herb...

329
00:29:03,410 --> 00:29:06,580
to restore the powers
of the Black Panther...

330
00:29:07,623 --> 00:29:10,626
and take you to the Ancestral Plane.

331
00:29:14,171 --> 00:29:15,214
T'Chaka...

332
00:29:15,380 --> 00:29:18,383
we call on you.

333
00:29:18,550 --> 00:29:21,428
Come here to your son.

334
00:29:34,233 --> 00:29:35,400
Praise the ancestors.

335
00:31:05,407 --> 00:31:06,283
Father.

336
00:31:06,783 --> 00:31:07,910
My son.

337
00:31:17,336 --> 00:31:18,795
I'm sorry.

338
00:31:18,962 --> 00:31:20,756
Stand up.

339
00:31:20,923 --> 00:31:23,133
You are a king.

340
00:31:37,064 --> 00:31:40,067
What is wrong my son?

341
00:31:40,484 --> 00:31:42,819
I am not ready.

342
00:31:43,654 --> 00:31:45,989
Have you not prepared

343
00:31:46,156 --> 00:31:50,369
to be king your whole life?

344
00:31:50,786 --> 00:31:54,081
Have you not trained and studied,

345
00:31:54,414 --> 00:31:57,084
been by my side?

346
00:31:59,253 --> 00:32:01,505
That is not what I am talking about.

347
00:32:05,467 --> 00:32:08,637
I am not ready to be without you.

348
00:32:09,930 --> 00:32:14,434
A man who has not prepared
his children for his own death...

349
00:32:14,601 --> 00:32:16,770
has failed as a father.

350
00:32:16,937 --> 00:32:19,481
Have I ever failed you?

351
00:32:20,190 --> 00:32:21,525
Never.

352
00:32:26,530 --> 00:32:29,783
Tell me how to best protect Wakanda.

353
00:32:32,077 --> 00:32:34,496
I want to be a great king, Baba.

354
00:32:36,039 --> 00:32:37,457
Just like you.

355
00:32:38,125 --> 00:32:40,043
You're going to struggle.

356
00:32:40,210 --> 00:32:43,839
So you'll need to surround yourself
with people you trust.

357
00:32:44,006 --> 00:32:47,259
You're a good man with a good heart.

358
00:32:48,343 --> 00:32:50,762
And it's hard for a good man to be king.

359
00:32:55,267 --> 00:32:56,560
Breathe.

360
00:32:57,853 --> 00:32:59,271
T'Challa, breathe.

361
00:33:01,106 --> 00:33:02,441
Breathe.

362
00:33:03,400 --> 00:33:04,985
He was there.

363
00:33:06,653 --> 00:33:09,740
He was there. My father.

364
00:33:25,756 --> 00:33:26,590
Just one?

365
00:33:33,430 --> 00:33:35,265
Come home, Nakia.

366
00:33:35,432 --> 00:33:36,683
I'm right here.

367
00:33:36,850 --> 00:33:38,310
Stay.

368
00:33:38,977 --> 00:33:42,481
I came to support you
and to honor your father...

369
00:33:42,648 --> 00:33:44,024
but I can't stay.

370
00:33:45,901 --> 00:33:48,028
I found my calling out there.

371
00:33:48,779 --> 00:33:51,657
I've seen too many in need
just to turn a blind eye.

372
00:33:52,324 --> 00:33:53,659
I can't be happy here...

373
00:33:53,825 --> 00:33:56,537
knowing that there's people out there
who have nothing.

374
00:33:57,996 --> 00:34:00,582
What would you have Wakanda do about it?

375
00:34:01,291 --> 00:34:02,876
Share what we have.

376
00:34:03,043 --> 00:34:04,545
We could provide aid...

377
00:34:04,711 --> 00:34:07,005
and access to technology
and refuge to those who need it.

378
00:34:07,381 --> 00:34:09,632
Other countries do it,
we could do it better.

379
00:34:11,301 --> 00:34:14,221
We are not like
these other countries, Nakia.

380
00:34:15,806 --> 00:34:17,306
If the world found out
what we truly are...

381
00:34:17,474 --> 00:34:18,976
what we possess...

382
00:34:19,141 --> 00:34:20,811
we could lose our way of life.

383
00:34:20,978 --> 00:34:25,190
Wakanda is strong enough to help others
and protect ourselves at the same time.

384
00:34:26,984 --> 00:34:29,902
If you were not so stubborn,
you would make a great queen.

385
00:34:30,070 --> 00:34:32,531
I would make a great queen
because I am so stubborn.

386
00:34:32,697 --> 00:34:36,201
-See, you admit it!
-If that's what I wanted.

387
00:34:43,417 --> 00:34:44,960
Is that him?

388
00:34:47,170 --> 00:34:50,215
Glory to Bast, man. Is he still growing?

389
00:34:51,717 --> 00:34:52,717
Of course.

390
00:34:53,552 --> 00:34:55,554
I see Nakia is back.

391
00:34:57,054 --> 00:34:58,223
You guys going to work it out?

392
00:35:04,563 --> 00:35:05,689
T'Challa...

393
00:35:06,398 --> 00:35:07,941
what's wrong?

394
00:35:08,108 --> 00:35:09,693
Nakia thinks we should be doing more.

395
00:35:09,860 --> 00:35:10,861
More, like what?

396
00:35:11,028 --> 00:35:13,280
Foreign aid, refugee programs.

397
00:35:13,447 --> 00:35:15,282
You let the refugees in...

398
00:35:15,949 --> 00:35:17,910
they bring their problems with them.

399
00:35:18,076 --> 00:35:20,370
And then Wakanda is like everywhere else.

400
00:35:22,331 --> 00:35:25,083
Now if you said
you wanted me and my men...

401
00:35:26,043 --> 00:35:29,463
to go out there and clean up the world,
then I'll be all for it.

402
00:35:29,880 --> 00:35:33,509
But waging war on other countries
has never been our way.

403
00:35:38,263 --> 00:35:39,264
You, too?

404
00:35:39,431 --> 00:35:41,099
Bast! We're in trouble.

405
00:35:44,102 --> 00:35:45,229
My King.

406
00:35:46,188 --> 00:35:47,147
My love.

407
00:35:47,314 --> 00:35:50,776
You will never guess who just popped up
on our radar.

408
00:35:54,571 --> 00:35:56,365
A misidentified Wakandan artifact...

409
00:35:56,532 --> 00:35:59,201
was stolen yesterday
from a British museum.

410
00:36:00,494 --> 00:36:03,497
We have learned Ulysses Klaue...

411
00:36:03,664 --> 00:36:06,500
plans to sell the vibranium
to an American buyer...

412
00:36:06,667 --> 00:36:08,001
in South Korea...

413
00:36:08,168 --> 00:36:09,586
tomorrow night.

414
00:36:11,296 --> 00:36:15,175
Klaue has escaped our pursuits
for almost 30 years.

415
00:36:16,134 --> 00:36:19,596
Not capturing him is, perhaps,
my father's greatest regret.

416
00:36:19,763 --> 00:36:22,850
I wish to bring Klaue back here
to stand trial.

417
00:36:23,016 --> 00:36:27,646
Wakanda does not need a warrior
right now.

418
00:36:28,188 --> 00:36:29,064
We need a king.

419
00:36:29,231 --> 00:36:31,900
My parents were killed when he attacked.

420
00:36:32,943 --> 00:36:36,947
Not a day goes by when I do not think
about what Klaue took from us.

421
00:36:38,657 --> 00:36:39,575
From me.

422
00:36:39,867 --> 00:36:42,661
It's too great an opportunity to pass.

423
00:36:42,828 --> 00:36:46,039
Take me with you. We'll take him down
together, side by side.

424
00:36:46,206 --> 00:36:49,251
I need you here
protecting the border.

425
00:36:49,418 --> 00:36:50,669
Then I ask...

426
00:36:50,836 --> 00:36:52,963
you kill him where he stands...

427
00:36:53,130 --> 00:36:55,215
or you bring him back to us.

428
00:36:55,966 --> 00:36:57,509
You have my word.

429
00:36:59,261 --> 00:37:01,388
I will bring him back.

430
00:37:02,848 --> 00:37:04,892
We will proceed with the mission.

431
00:37:50,979 --> 00:37:51,939
My King!

432
00:37:52,105 --> 00:37:53,857
Stop it. Stop it.

433
00:37:56,610 --> 00:37:59,029
I've already sent a car ahead
to Busan for you.

434
00:37:59,655 --> 00:38:01,532
Who are you taking with you to Korea?

435
00:38:01,949 --> 00:38:03,033
Okoye.

436
00:38:03,742 --> 00:38:05,619
And Nakia as well.

437
00:38:07,496 --> 00:38:11,250
You sure it's a good idea
to take your ex on a mission?

438
00:38:11,708 --> 00:38:12,793
Yes.

439
00:38:13,961 --> 00:38:17,005
We'll be fine. Besides,
you'll be on call should we need backup.

440
00:38:17,172 --> 00:38:18,340
Yes!

441
00:38:18,507 --> 00:38:20,884
I have great things to show you, Brother.

442
00:38:21,051 --> 00:38:23,428
Here are your communication devices
for Korea.

443
00:38:24,263 --> 00:38:28,767
Unlimited range, also equipped
with audio surveillance system.

444
00:38:28,934 --> 00:38:30,269
Check these out.

445
00:38:31,603 --> 00:38:34,606
Remote access Kimoyo Beads.

446
00:38:34,773 --> 00:38:37,568
Updated to interface directly
with my sand table.

447
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:41,405
And what are these?

448
00:38:41,572 --> 00:38:45,033
The real question is what are those?

449
00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:47,119
Why do you have your toes out in my lab?

450
00:38:47,286 --> 00:38:49,288
What, you don't like my royal sandals?

451
00:38:49,454 --> 00:38:52,249
I wanted to go old school
for my first day.

452
00:38:52,416 --> 00:38:54,334
I bet the Elders loved that.

453
00:38:55,586 --> 00:38:56,587
Try them on.

454
00:39:00,674 --> 00:39:01,717
Fully automated.

455
00:39:02,134 --> 00:39:04,761
Like the old American movie
Baba used to watch.

456
00:39:05,220 --> 00:39:07,723
And I made them
completely sound absorbent.

457
00:39:09,892 --> 00:39:10,893
Interesting.

458
00:39:11,059 --> 00:39:12,811
Guess what I call them.

459
00:39:12,978 --> 00:39:14,354
Sneakers.

460
00:39:16,190 --> 00:39:17,316
Because you...

461
00:39:17,482 --> 00:39:18,650
Never mind.

462
00:39:20,194 --> 00:39:21,528
If you're going to take on Klaue...

463
00:39:21,695 --> 00:39:25,866
you'll need the best
the design group has to offer.

464
00:39:26,033 --> 00:39:27,159
Exhibit A.

465
00:39:27,326 --> 00:39:28,869
-My design.
-Old tech.

466
00:39:29,036 --> 00:39:31,288
-Old?
-Functional, but old.

467
00:39:31,455 --> 00:39:35,167
"Hey, people are shooting at me.
Wait, let me put on my helmet."

468
00:39:35,334 --> 00:39:36,335
Enough.

469
00:39:38,003 --> 00:39:39,963
Now, look at these.

470
00:39:42,716 --> 00:39:43,926
Do you like that one?

471
00:39:44,092 --> 00:39:45,385
Tempting.

472
00:39:46,261 --> 00:39:48,597
But the idea is to not be noticed.

473
00:39:50,599 --> 00:39:51,433
This one.

474
00:39:58,482 --> 00:40:00,150
Now tell it to go on.

475
00:40:07,616 --> 00:40:10,911
The entire suit sits
within the teeth of the necklace.

476
00:40:11,787 --> 00:40:13,205
Strike it.

477
00:40:13,789 --> 00:40:14,790
Anywhere?

478
00:40:18,961 --> 00:40:20,504
Not that hard, genius!

479
00:40:20,671 --> 00:40:22,881
You told me to strike it.
You didn't say how hard.

480
00:40:23,048 --> 00:40:25,884
I invite you to my lab,
and you just kick things around?

481
00:40:26,051 --> 00:40:28,762
Well, maybe you should make it
a little stronger.

482
00:40:29,972 --> 00:40:31,515
Wait a minute.

483
00:40:31,682 --> 00:40:34,393
The nanites absorb the kinetic energy...

484
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:36,979
and hold it in place for redistribution.

485
00:40:37,145 --> 00:40:38,480
Very nice.

486
00:40:38,647 --> 00:40:41,316
Strike it again in the same spot.

487
00:40:43,986 --> 00:40:45,487
You're recording?

488
00:40:46,071 --> 00:40:47,823
For research purposes.

489
00:40:55,247 --> 00:40:56,665
Delete that footage.

490
00:41:16,894 --> 00:41:18,061
This way.

491
00:41:21,064 --> 00:41:22,691
Bast willing, this will go quickly...

492
00:41:22,858 --> 00:41:25,861
and I can get this ridiculous thing
off my head.

493
00:41:26,028 --> 00:41:29,239
It looks nice.
Just whip it back and forth.

494
00:41:29,406 --> 00:41:32,075
What? It's a disgrace.

495
00:41:34,036 --> 00:41:35,704
Hello Sophia.

496
00:41:35,996 --> 00:41:38,207
Good to see you.

497
00:41:39,499 --> 00:41:41,084
Who are these two?

498
00:41:41,251 --> 00:41:45,839
My friends from Kenya.
Very deep pockets. They're good.

499
00:41:46,256 --> 00:41:48,717
Good for trouble...

500
00:41:48,884 --> 00:41:50,469
...like you?

501
00:41:59,311 --> 00:42:00,771
Thank you!

502
00:42:23,585 --> 00:42:24,878
Spread out.

503
00:42:25,045 --> 00:42:27,422
The buyer is likely already here.

504
00:42:45,274 --> 00:42:47,025
The woman outside.

505
00:42:47,734 --> 00:42:50,153
What trouble was she referring to?

506
00:42:51,154 --> 00:42:54,950
I got into a disagreement
with some ivory traders.

507
00:42:55,117 --> 00:42:56,660
Made a bit of a mess.

508
00:42:57,244 --> 00:43:01,415
And will there be any trouble tonight,
Ms. Kenyan Heiress?

509
00:43:01,582 --> 00:43:02,749
Depends...

510
00:43:02,916 --> 00:43:05,127
on how quickly we finish the mission.

511
00:43:05,294 --> 00:43:07,129
Can we please focus?

512
00:43:08,881 --> 00:43:10,174
Thank you.

513
00:43:11,300 --> 00:43:12,759
Over here.

514
00:43:13,510 --> 00:43:15,345
One whiskey, please.

515
00:43:25,981 --> 00:43:28,775
Eyes up. Americans.

516
00:43:32,404 --> 00:43:33,572
I count three.

517
00:43:35,824 --> 00:43:36,950
Five.

518
00:43:37,117 --> 00:43:39,786
How could you miss
Greased Lightning there behind you?

519
00:43:39,953 --> 00:43:41,079
Six.

520
00:43:41,246 --> 00:43:44,666
Just spotted an old friend
who works for the CIA.

521
00:43:44,833 --> 00:43:47,419
It just got a little more complicated.

522
00:43:50,714 --> 00:43:51,840
Agent Ross.

523
00:43:52,007 --> 00:43:53,133
Your Highness.

524
00:43:53,634 --> 00:43:55,219
You are buying from Klaue.

525
00:43:57,179 --> 00:43:58,931
What I'm doing or not doing...

526
00:43:59,097 --> 00:44:01,808
on behalf of the U.S. government
is none of your concern.

527
00:44:01,975 --> 00:44:03,644
Now, whatever the hell you're up to...

528
00:44:03,810 --> 00:44:05,896
do me a favor, stay out of my way.

529
00:44:06,063 --> 00:44:07,356
I gave you Zemo.

530
00:44:07,523 --> 00:44:08,899
Didn't I keep it under wraps...

531
00:44:09,066 --> 00:44:12,736
that the king of a third world country
runs around in a bulletproof cat suit?

532
00:44:12,903 --> 00:44:14,279
I'd say we were even.

533
00:44:14,446 --> 00:44:16,031
You really need to leave, now.

534
00:44:16,657 --> 00:44:19,993
Klaue is leaving out that door with me.

535
00:44:21,078 --> 00:44:22,704
You've been warned.

536
00:44:24,623 --> 00:44:25,666
Three, craps.

537
00:44:26,291 --> 00:44:27,543
Hey, you won!

538
00:44:29,086 --> 00:44:30,379
You know what?

539
00:44:30,546 --> 00:44:32,548
I think I'll just take these...

540
00:44:32,714 --> 00:44:36,844
bring them over here
and hold on for safekeeping.

541
00:44:39,471 --> 00:44:42,558
Okay, heads up.
The king of Wakanda is here.

542
00:44:42,724 --> 00:44:44,434
He cannot leave with Klaue.

543
00:44:45,978 --> 00:44:46,979
All right.

544
00:44:47,145 --> 00:44:49,606
Vibranium from the attack on Sokovia
links back to a person...

545
00:44:49,773 --> 00:44:51,984
that I'm not actually saying
I'm here to make a deal with...

546
00:44:52,150 --> 00:44:54,528
but that deal will not be called off.

547
00:44:54,695 --> 00:44:57,573
When the dust settles,
you and me can work something out.

548
00:44:57,739 --> 00:44:59,616
I'm not here to make a deal.

549
00:45:26,476 --> 00:45:28,520
Klaue, plus eight!

550
00:45:28,896 --> 00:45:29,855
General.

551
00:45:30,022 --> 00:45:31,899
In position to secure our exit.

552
00:45:32,065 --> 00:45:33,025
And the vibranium?

553
00:45:33,192 --> 00:45:34,860
I don't see it yet.

554
00:45:35,027 --> 00:45:37,613
I thought there were no weapons allowed
in here.

555
00:45:37,779 --> 00:45:39,531
There's not supposed to be.

556
00:45:39,698 --> 00:45:42,075
Somebody did not get the memo.

557
00:45:42,993 --> 00:45:44,578
Definitely armed.

558
00:45:45,412 --> 00:45:47,289
Well, that is quite the entourage.

559
00:45:47,456 --> 00:45:48,624
You got a mixtape coming out?

560
00:45:48,790 --> 00:45:51,418
Yeah. Yeah, actually, there is one.

561
00:45:51,585 --> 00:45:53,462
I'll send you the SoundCloud link,
if you like.

562
00:45:53,629 --> 00:45:54,922
Hey, Dave, can you get the link
to the tape?

563
00:45:55,088 --> 00:45:56,673
Please, don't make me
listen to your music.

564
00:45:56,840 --> 00:45:58,592
I just meant
you got a lot of people with you.

565
00:46:00,010 --> 00:46:01,178
You think they're for you?

566
00:46:02,304 --> 00:46:03,472
Don't worry.

567
00:46:03,639 --> 00:46:06,767
I can do a deal with you all by myself,
thank you very much.

568
00:46:14,191 --> 00:46:16,693
Six more. It's a setup.

569
00:46:17,402 --> 00:46:18,946
You got the diamonds?

570
00:46:19,655 --> 00:46:21,406
Okay. That's enough.

571
00:46:23,659 --> 00:46:25,911
-We need to move on Klaue.
-Stand down.

572
00:46:26,328 --> 00:46:27,996
We can't afford a shootout.

573
00:46:28,163 --> 00:46:29,164
Vibranium?

574
00:46:38,465 --> 00:46:40,592
I was going to buy a fancy suitcase...

575
00:46:40,759 --> 00:46:43,262
but I thought
I'd save myself some money.

576
00:46:43,720 --> 00:46:45,347
It's now or never.

577
00:46:45,514 --> 00:46:46,640
Stand down!

578
00:46:47,224 --> 00:46:47,933
Hey!

579
00:46:50,686 --> 00:46:52,062
I've been made.

580
00:47:01,905 --> 00:47:03,240
Wakandans! They're here!

581
00:47:05,701 --> 00:47:07,286
-Get outta here!
-Kill 'em all!

582
00:47:09,162 --> 00:47:10,539
Diamonds, quick!

583
00:48:07,304 --> 00:48:08,847
Murderer!

584
00:48:14,853 --> 00:48:17,189
You know, you look just like
your old man.

585
00:48:26,698 --> 00:48:28,242
I made it rain!

586
00:48:29,159 --> 00:48:30,869
Let's get out of here, boss!

587
00:48:34,706 --> 00:48:37,584
That was awesome! That was awesome!

588
00:48:37,751 --> 00:48:40,295
Let's go! Go, go, go, come on!

589
00:48:42,172 --> 00:48:44,633
-Do we just leave him?
-He'll catch up.

590
00:48:52,891 --> 00:48:54,017
Shuri!

591
00:48:57,604 --> 00:48:58,605
Yes!

592
00:48:58,772 --> 00:49:01,191
Remote driving system activated.

593
00:49:02,025 --> 00:49:04,945
-Wait! Which side of the road is it?
-For Bast's sake!

594
00:49:05,112 --> 00:49:06,446
-Just drive!
-Okay, calm down!

595
00:49:15,497 --> 00:49:16,415
Let's go!

596
00:49:16,582 --> 00:49:18,792
Put some music on.
What do you think this is, a funeral?

597
00:49:22,421 --> 00:49:23,881
Which one is he in now?

598
00:49:26,175 --> 00:49:27,509
Hey, split up!

599
00:49:29,303 --> 00:49:30,846
-They're trying to lose us.
-I'll take the right.

600
00:49:33,182 --> 00:49:35,684
We'll take the other two!
I see a shortcut.

601
00:49:51,867 --> 00:49:52,993
We're not going to make it!

602
00:49:54,661 --> 00:49:55,746
Keep going!

603
00:50:02,836 --> 00:50:03,837
Brother!

604
00:50:13,472 --> 00:50:14,806
Hey, what was that?

605
00:50:14,973 --> 00:50:16,975
Don't worry about it.
You're doing great.

606
00:50:28,403 --> 00:50:29,530
Guns.

607
00:50:30,822 --> 00:50:32,074
So primitive!

608
00:50:32,241 --> 00:50:35,327
It's a vibranium car, you idiots!
The bullets won't penetrate!

609
00:50:37,538 --> 00:50:38,580
What are you doing?

610
00:50:38,747 --> 00:50:39,957
Just drive.

611
00:50:57,266 --> 00:50:58,016
Shit!

612
00:51:11,363 --> 00:51:13,031
Hey, look at your suit.

613
00:51:13,198 --> 00:51:16,285
You've been taking bullets,
charging it up with kinetic energy.

614
00:51:18,161 --> 00:51:19,371
Pull around the truck.

615
00:51:24,209 --> 00:51:25,419
Where'd he go?

616
00:51:34,803 --> 00:51:36,138
You show-off.

617
00:51:37,389 --> 00:51:38,390
There he is!

618
00:51:40,809 --> 00:51:41,727
Hold tight!

619
00:51:45,731 --> 00:51:46,773
All right. Let's have some fun!

620
00:52:15,135 --> 00:52:16,136
Hop in.

621
00:52:16,637 --> 00:52:19,014
Put that spear in the trunk.

622
00:52:24,228 --> 00:52:25,354
Faster, Shuri.

623
00:52:25,521 --> 00:52:27,147
I'm going as fast as I can!

624
00:52:28,815 --> 00:52:30,025
Take a right! Take a right!

625
00:52:34,738 --> 00:52:35,822
No, no, no!

626
00:52:38,200 --> 00:52:39,284
Brother!

627
00:53:02,766 --> 00:53:03,809
Klaue!

628
00:53:05,978 --> 00:53:07,563
Did you think we would forget?

629
00:53:16,738 --> 00:53:18,574
Look at me, murderer!

630
00:53:19,616 --> 00:53:20,993
Where did you get this weapon?

631
00:53:21,368 --> 00:53:23,829
You savages didn't deserve it.

632
00:53:26,498 --> 00:53:29,960
Oh, mercy, King. Mercy.

633
00:53:30,127 --> 00:53:32,254
Every breath you take is mercy from me.

634
00:53:32,421 --> 00:53:33,672
King!

635
00:53:34,298 --> 00:53:36,175
The world watches.

636
00:53:36,341 --> 00:53:38,260
Come on. Guys. Let's go, huh?

637
00:53:44,308 --> 00:53:45,267
Yeah.

638
00:53:59,740 --> 00:54:00,991
Hello.

639
00:54:03,869 --> 00:54:06,663
I can see you! I can.
I can see you.

640
00:54:14,880 --> 00:54:16,590
So this is a big mess.

641
00:54:16,757 --> 00:54:18,967
I figured we could go good cop, bad cop.

642
00:54:19,134 --> 00:54:20,427
I'll talk to him first,
then you guys go in.

643
00:54:20,594 --> 00:54:24,389
We can't let him talk to Klaue alone.

644
00:54:27,434 --> 00:54:33,440
Better to let him talk to Klaue alone
for 5 minutes than to make a scene here.

645
00:54:34,483 --> 00:54:37,945
After your questioning, we will take him
back to Wakanda with us.

646
00:54:38,111 --> 00:54:40,656
What? No.
Look, I like you, a lot.

647
00:54:40,822 --> 00:54:43,617
But he's in my custody now.
He's not going anywhere.

648
00:54:43,784 --> 00:54:47,120
Listen, I'm doing you guys a favor
by letting you even be in here.

649
00:54:49,373 --> 00:54:51,959
If he touches you again,

650
00:54:52,167 --> 00:54:54,878
I'm going to impale him to this desk.

651
00:54:55,796 --> 00:54:57,130
Does she speak English?

652
00:54:57,506 --> 00:54:59,216
When she wants to.

653
00:55:01,176 --> 00:55:04,471
I'm going in.
When I'm done, you guys are up.

654
00:55:04,638 --> 00:55:06,390
-Agent Ross.
-Yeah?

655
00:55:06,932 --> 00:55:09,852
I do appreciate your help in Busan.

656
00:55:10,394 --> 00:55:11,603
You see that?

657
00:55:12,187 --> 00:55:13,355
It's called diplomacy.

658
00:55:14,481 --> 00:55:15,482
You're welcome.

659
00:55:17,734 --> 00:55:18,986
Okoye.

660
00:55:19,903 --> 00:55:20,988
Play nice.

661
00:55:21,154 --> 00:55:22,239
Americans.

662
00:55:34,293 --> 00:55:36,211
You know, you really shouldn't trust
the Wakandans.

663
00:55:36,378 --> 00:55:37,671
I'm much more your speed.

664
00:55:37,838 --> 00:55:39,673
I don't trust anybody, not in this job.

665
00:55:39,840 --> 00:55:42,342
But what I am interested in
is that arm cannon out there.

666
00:55:42,509 --> 00:55:43,677
Where'd you get that?

667
00:55:43,844 --> 00:55:45,554
It's an old mining tool
that I made some adjustments to.

668
00:55:45,721 --> 00:55:48,098
But I can get you one, if you like.

669
00:55:48,265 --> 00:55:51,226
Why don't you give me the name
of your supplier, and I'll ask them.

670
00:55:51,393 --> 00:55:52,853
He's right outside.

671
00:55:53,020 --> 00:55:54,605
Why don't you ask him yourself?

672
00:55:54,771 --> 00:55:56,273
What? T'Challa?

673
00:55:56,440 --> 00:55:59,776
You're telling me that weapon
on your arm is from Wakanda?

674
00:55:59,943 --> 00:56:00,903
Bingo.

675
00:56:02,237 --> 00:56:05,282
What do you actually know
about Wakanda?

676
00:56:07,868 --> 00:56:09,953
Shepherds, textiles, cool outfits.

677
00:56:10,120 --> 00:56:11,413
It's all a front.

678
00:56:12,039 --> 00:56:14,625
Explorers searched for it for centuries.

679
00:56:14,791 --> 00:56:17,252
El Dorado, the Golden City.

680
00:56:17,419 --> 00:56:19,755
They thought they could find it
in South America...

681
00:56:19,922 --> 00:56:22,799
but it was in Africa the whole time.

682
00:56:22,966 --> 00:56:24,760
A technological marvel.

683
00:56:24,927 --> 00:56:29,473
All because it was built on a mound
of the most valuable metal known to man.

684
00:56:29,640 --> 00:56:32,726
Isipho, they call it. The gift.

685
00:56:33,310 --> 00:56:34,436
Vibranium.

686
00:56:34,603 --> 00:56:36,772
Vibranium, yeah,
strongest metal on earth.

687
00:56:36,939 --> 00:56:38,148
It's not just a metal.

688
00:56:38,315 --> 00:56:40,859
They sew it into their clothes.

689
00:56:41,026 --> 00:56:43,820
It powers their city, their tech...

690
00:56:43,987 --> 00:56:45,239
their weapons.

691
00:56:45,906 --> 00:56:46,990
Weapons?

692
00:56:47,157 --> 00:56:50,661
Yeah. Makes my arm cannon look like
a leaf blower.

693
00:56:50,827 --> 00:56:54,122
That's a nice fairy tale,
but Wakanda is a third world country...

694
00:56:54,289 --> 00:56:56,750
and you stole all their vibranium.

695
00:56:56,917 --> 00:56:58,210
I stole...

696
00:57:01,588 --> 00:57:02,840
All of it?

697
00:57:04,132 --> 00:57:06,718
I took a tiny piece of it.

698
00:57:06,885 --> 00:57:08,595
They have a mountain full of it.

699
00:57:08,762 --> 00:57:10,973
They've been mining it
for thousands of years...

700
00:57:11,139 --> 00:57:13,392
and they still haven't scratched
the surface.

701
00:57:13,559 --> 00:57:17,187
I'm the only outsider who's seen it
and got out of there alive.

702
00:57:17,729 --> 00:57:22,359
If you don't believe me, you ask
your friend what his suit is made of.

703
00:57:22,693 --> 00:57:25,279
What his claws are made of.

704
00:57:48,385 --> 00:57:49,970
Your father told the UN...

705
00:57:50,137 --> 00:57:53,056
that Klaue stole
all the vibranium you had.

706
00:57:53,223 --> 00:57:54,766
But now he's telling me you have more.

707
00:57:54,933 --> 00:57:58,937
And you believe the word
of an arms dealer strapped to a chair?

708
00:58:16,580 --> 00:58:18,832
Where is that?

709
00:58:19,750 --> 00:58:21,585
Back there.

710
00:58:33,388 --> 00:58:34,723
How much more are you hiding?

711
00:58:36,558 --> 00:58:38,060
Something is happening out back.

712
00:58:44,274 --> 00:58:45,317
Get down!

713
00:58:50,447 --> 00:58:51,240
Stand down!

714
00:58:54,785 --> 00:58:55,786
Cover!

715
00:58:55,953 --> 00:58:56,912
Grenade!

716
00:59:00,165 --> 00:59:02,501
I see you took your time, didn't you?

717
00:59:22,479 --> 00:59:23,647
My King!

718
00:59:26,733 --> 00:59:27,943
My King.

719
00:59:28,402 --> 00:59:29,528
Nakia.

720
00:59:32,281 --> 00:59:34,074
He just jumped in front of me.

721
00:59:36,910 --> 00:59:40,038
I don't think he'll make it here.
It hit his spine.

722
00:59:42,666 --> 00:59:44,376
Give me a Kimoyo Bead.

723
00:59:48,463 --> 00:59:50,632
This will stabilize him for now.

724
00:59:58,682 --> 01:00:00,184
Give him to us.

725
01:00:01,101 --> 01:00:02,603
We can save him.

726
01:00:11,528 --> 01:00:14,031
Our mission was to bring back Klaue.

727
01:00:15,157 --> 01:00:16,491
We failed.

728
01:00:16,783 --> 01:00:19,870
This man is
a foreign intelligence operative.

729
01:00:20,037 --> 01:00:22,581
How do we justify
bringing him into our borders?

730
01:00:22,748 --> 01:00:23,999
He took a bullet for me.

731
01:00:24,166 --> 01:00:25,876
That was his choice.

732
01:00:26,585 --> 01:00:28,587
So now we are just supposed to
let him die?

733
01:00:28,754 --> 01:00:30,589
Let us consider that we heal him.

734
01:00:31,215 --> 01:00:34,009
It is his duty to report back
to his country.

735
01:00:34,843 --> 01:00:36,845
And as king, it is your duty
to protect ours.

736
01:00:37,012 --> 01:00:39,431
I'm well aware of my duties, General.

737
01:00:40,057 --> 01:00:43,227
I cannot just let him die...

738
01:00:44,061 --> 01:00:46,438
knowing we can save him.

739
01:00:46,605 --> 01:00:49,024
Where exactly are we taking him?

740
01:00:56,657 --> 01:00:59,451
Great! Another broken white boy
for us to fix.

741
01:00:59,618 --> 01:01:01,578
This is going to be fun.

742
01:01:08,669 --> 01:01:09,920
He will live.

743
01:01:14,132 --> 01:01:15,551
W'Kabi is here.

744
01:01:24,852 --> 01:01:27,187
What's going on, brother?
Where is Klaue?

745
01:01:27,729 --> 01:01:29,231
He's not here.

746
01:01:33,151 --> 01:01:35,320
He slipped through our hands.

747
01:01:36,905 --> 01:01:38,115
"Slipped"?

748
01:01:40,075 --> 01:01:43,871
For 30 years, your father was in power
and did nothing.

749
01:01:44,037 --> 01:01:46,248
With you, I thought it'd be different.

750
01:01:47,291 --> 01:01:49,126
But it's more of the same.

751
01:02:08,937 --> 01:02:10,647
Let's get going, boss.

752
01:02:12,191 --> 01:02:14,026
You always sell to the CIA?

753
01:02:14,193 --> 01:02:16,111
I sell to the highest bidder.

754
01:02:16,278 --> 01:02:18,405
But don't you worry.
When I get back to Joburg...

755
01:02:18,572 --> 01:02:21,366
and I lay low for a bit, I'll make sure
both you guys get paid.

756
01:02:21,742 --> 01:02:24,328
I ain't worried about the money, bro.
I know you good for it.

757
01:02:24,494 --> 01:02:27,080
On our way back,
just drop us off in Wakanda.

758
01:02:27,247 --> 01:02:29,166
-You don't want to go there, boy.
-Yeah, I do.

759
01:02:32,336 --> 01:02:33,212
Drop it!

760
01:02:33,670 --> 01:02:37,216
Or your little Bonnie and Clyde routine
ends today.

761
01:02:37,382 --> 01:02:38,759
Put your gun down now!

762
01:02:38,926 --> 01:02:40,511
I'm sorry.

763
01:02:40,677 --> 01:02:42,930
-Sorry, Erik.
-It's gonna be okay.

764
01:03:11,542 --> 01:03:13,836
You really want to go to Wakanda?

765
01:03:14,878 --> 01:03:16,338
They're savages.

766
01:03:17,130 --> 01:03:20,425
This is what they do to people like us.

767
01:03:20,592 --> 01:03:21,760
I ain't worried about no brand.

768
01:03:21,927 --> 01:03:23,387
Check these out.

769
01:03:24,721 --> 01:03:26,098
Each one is for a kill.

770
01:03:26,557 --> 01:03:29,268
You can scar yourself as much
as you'd like.

771
01:03:29,434 --> 01:03:32,229
To them, you'll just be an outsider.

772
01:03:32,396 --> 01:03:34,690
You're crazy to think
that you can walk in there.

773
01:03:41,613 --> 01:03:44,616
To think I saw you
as some crazy American.

774
01:03:58,839 --> 01:04:00,132
Leave us!

775
01:04:11,059 --> 01:04:14,563
So your mission did not go as planned.

776
01:04:15,647 --> 01:04:19,318
What happened to my uncle N'Jobu?

777
01:04:20,027 --> 01:04:22,821
My father told me he disappeared.

778
01:04:23,739 --> 01:04:25,365
There was a man today...

779
01:04:26,283 --> 01:04:30,245
wearing a ring identical to this one.

780
01:04:31,788 --> 01:04:33,790
That is not possible.

781
01:04:34,291 --> 01:04:37,669
He helped Klaue escape from us
and he was wearing this ring!

782
01:04:37,836 --> 01:04:40,088
My grandfather's ring!

783
01:04:40,255 --> 01:04:42,925
Do not tell me what is possible.
Tell me the truth!

784
01:04:47,721 --> 01:04:49,223
Some truths...

785
01:04:52,184 --> 01:04:55,687
are too much to bear, T'Challa.

786
01:04:56,688 --> 01:04:59,191
That is not your choice to make.

787
01:05:00,067 --> 01:05:02,694
-What happened to him?
-I promised the king to say nothing.

788
01:05:02,861 --> 01:05:04,696
I am your king now!

789
01:05:20,087 --> 01:05:22,631
Your uncle took...

790
01:05:23,882 --> 01:05:27,803
a War Dog assignment in America.

791
01:05:30,597 --> 01:05:31,807
Your father...

792
01:05:32,599 --> 01:05:34,309
placed me there...

793
01:05:35,269 --> 01:05:36,186
to observe...

794
01:05:37,771 --> 01:05:39,857
unbeknownst to him.

795
01:05:40,023 --> 01:05:42,943
Your uncle fell in love
with an American woman.

796
01:05:43,527 --> 01:05:44,736
They had a child.

797
01:05:46,154 --> 01:05:48,490
The hardships he saw there...

798
01:05:49,867 --> 01:05:51,952
radicalized your uncle.

799
01:05:52,119 --> 01:05:54,329
I observed for as long as I could.

800
01:05:55,539 --> 01:05:57,165
Their leaders have been assassinated.

801
01:05:57,332 --> 01:05:59,751
Communities flooded with drugs
and weapons.

802
01:05:59,918 --> 01:06:02,296
They are overly policed
and incarcerated.

803
01:06:02,754 --> 01:06:04,506
All over the planet...

804
01:06:04,673 --> 01:06:08,051
our people suffer because
they don't have the tools to fight back.

805
01:06:09,052 --> 01:06:12,014
With vibranium weapons,
they could overthrow every country...

806
01:06:12,181 --> 01:06:15,350
and Wakanda could rule them all
the right way.

807
01:06:15,517 --> 01:06:19,062
He knew your father
would not support this.

808
01:06:19,938 --> 01:06:23,025
So, your uncle betrayed us.

809
01:06:23,192 --> 01:06:24,401
No!

810
01:06:24,568 --> 01:06:27,821
He helped Klaue steal the vibranium.

811
01:06:29,364 --> 01:06:30,782
No, no, no.

812
01:06:30,949 --> 01:06:32,534
You will return home at once...

813
01:06:32,701 --> 01:06:34,536
where you will face the Council...

814
01:06:34,703 --> 01:06:37,664
and inform them of your crimes.

815
01:06:37,831 --> 01:06:39,541
He drew his weapon on me.

816
01:06:39,708 --> 01:06:40,584
No!

817
01:06:57,059 --> 01:07:00,812
Your father killed his own brother...

818
01:07:00,979 --> 01:07:04,858
to save my life.

819
01:07:08,737 --> 01:07:11,865
Speak nothing of this.

820
01:07:16,161 --> 01:07:17,538
And the child?

821
01:07:21,375 --> 01:07:22,918
We left him.

822
01:07:31,343 --> 01:07:32,511
We had to...

823
01:07:33,637 --> 01:07:34,805
maintain...

824
01:07:36,390 --> 01:07:37,558
the lie.

825
01:08:03,041 --> 01:08:04,459
What is this?

826
01:08:05,002 --> 01:08:06,503
Just a little gift.

827
01:08:29,276 --> 01:08:31,528
Who are you?

828
01:09:20,911 --> 01:09:22,412
All right, where am I?

829
01:09:22,955 --> 01:09:25,207
Don't scare me like that, colonizer!

830
01:09:25,791 --> 01:09:27,542
What? My name is Everett.

831
01:09:27,960 --> 01:09:30,837
Yes, I know. Everett Ross...

832
01:09:31,004 --> 01:09:33,799
former air force pilot and now CIA.

833
01:09:34,299 --> 01:09:35,341
Right.

834
01:09:40,055 --> 01:09:41,473
Okay, is this Wakanda?

835
01:09:41,640 --> 01:09:43,267
No, it's Kansas.

836
01:09:46,435 --> 01:09:48,104
How long ago was Korea?

837
01:09:48,272 --> 01:09:49,398
Yesterday.

838
01:09:49,564 --> 01:09:52,943
I don't think so. Bullet wounds
don't just magically heal overnight.

839
01:09:53,986 --> 01:09:55,237
They do here.

840
01:09:55,404 --> 01:09:58,657
But not by magic, by technology.

841
01:10:02,870 --> 01:10:06,290
Don't touch anything.
My brother will return soon.

842
01:10:30,022 --> 01:10:32,482
These train things...

843
01:10:32,649 --> 01:10:34,902
that's magnetic levitation, right?

844
01:10:35,068 --> 01:10:36,111
Obviously.

845
01:10:36,278 --> 01:10:40,532
Obviously, but I've never seen it
this efficient.

846
01:10:43,118 --> 01:10:44,286
The light panels, what are they?

847
01:10:44,745 --> 01:10:46,955
-Sonic stabilizers.
-Sonic what?

848
01:10:47,331 --> 01:10:48,624
In its raw form...

849
01:10:48,790 --> 01:10:52,252
vibranium is too dangerous
to be transported at that speed...

850
01:10:52,419 --> 01:10:55,506
so I developed a way to temporarily
deactivate it.

851
01:10:56,632 --> 01:10:58,133
There's vibranium on those trains?

852
01:10:58,300 --> 01:11:00,511
There's vibranium all around us.

853
01:11:02,262 --> 01:11:03,847
That's how I healed you.

854
01:11:11,980 --> 01:11:13,398
Where is T'Challa?

855
01:11:13,565 --> 01:11:15,567
His Kimoyo Beads have been switched off.

856
01:11:15,734 --> 01:11:17,986
Well, we are not joined at the hip, Okoye.

857
01:11:18,153 --> 01:11:20,822
A man showed up at the border
who claims to have killed Klaue.

858
01:11:20,989 --> 01:11:21,865
What?

859
01:11:22,032 --> 01:11:24,618
W'Kabi is transporting him, as we speak,
to the palace.

860
01:11:24,785 --> 01:11:26,620
We need to find your brother!

861
01:11:26,787 --> 01:11:27,788
An outsider?

862
01:11:27,955 --> 01:11:29,581
No, a Wakandan.

863
01:11:29,748 --> 01:11:31,166
He's not a Wakandan.

864
01:11:33,794 --> 01:11:35,003
He's one of ours.

865
01:11:48,016 --> 01:11:50,060
He killed his own brother...

866
01:11:50,227 --> 01:11:52,396
and left a child behind...

867
01:11:52,563 --> 01:11:53,814
with nothing.

868
01:11:55,774 --> 01:11:57,401
What kind of king...

869
01:11:59,319 --> 01:12:01,488
What kind of man does that?

870
01:12:01,655 --> 01:12:03,866
No man is perfect.

871
01:12:04,741 --> 01:12:06,076
Not even your father.

872
01:12:06,243 --> 01:12:08,954
He didn't even give him a proper burial.

873
01:12:10,831 --> 01:12:13,917
My uncle N'Jobu betrayed us,
but my father...

874
01:12:15,335 --> 01:12:17,379
he may have created something
even worse.

875
01:12:17,796 --> 01:12:18,797
Hey.

876
01:12:20,632 --> 01:12:21,800
Look at me.

877
01:12:24,928 --> 01:12:28,932
You can't let your father's mistakes
define who you are.

878
01:12:30,559 --> 01:12:35,189
You get to decide what kind of king
you are going to be.

879
01:12:41,278 --> 01:12:43,864
Brother, you need to get here now!

880
01:12:44,281 --> 01:12:45,574
Erik Stevens.

881
01:12:46,283 --> 01:12:48,243
Graduated Annapolis age 19...

882
01:12:48,410 --> 01:12:50,329
MIT for grad school.

883
01:12:50,495 --> 01:12:52,664
Joined the SEALs
and went straight to Afghanistan...

884
01:12:52,831 --> 01:12:55,417
where he wrapped up confirmed kills,
like it was a video game.

885
01:12:55,876 --> 01:12:57,628
Started calling him Killmonger.

886
01:12:57,794 --> 01:13:00,464
He joined a JSOC ghost unit.
Now these guys are serious.

887
01:13:00,631 --> 01:13:02,049
They will drop off the grid...

888
01:13:02,216 --> 01:13:04,676
so they can commit assassinations
and take down governments.

889
01:13:05,511 --> 01:13:08,889
Did he reveal anything about his identity?

890
01:13:09,223 --> 01:13:10,724
He has a War Dog tattoo...

891
01:13:11,391 --> 01:13:13,977
but we have no record of him.

892
01:13:20,692 --> 01:13:22,528
Is this man Wakandan or not?

893
01:13:22,694 --> 01:13:25,572
Tell us what is going on.

894
01:13:45,008 --> 01:13:46,051
Speak.

895
01:13:46,468 --> 01:13:47,469
Speak.

896
01:13:49,429 --> 01:13:51,682
I'm standing in your house...

897
01:13:51,849 --> 01:13:55,602
serving justice to a man who stole
your vibranium and murdered your people.

898
01:13:56,436 --> 01:13:57,729
Justice your king couldn't deliver.

899
01:14:03,235 --> 01:14:05,821
I don't care that you brought Klaue.

900
01:14:05,988 --> 01:14:10,450
Only reason I don't kill you where you
stand is because I know who you are.

901
01:14:11,743 --> 01:14:13,412
Now, what do you want?

902
01:14:14,955 --> 01:14:16,665
I want the throne.

903
01:14:18,166 --> 01:14:19,376
My goodness.

904
01:14:21,962 --> 01:14:24,173
Y'all sittin' up here comfortable.

905
01:14:24,798 --> 01:14:26,300
Must feel good.

906
01:14:27,009 --> 01:14:30,220
It's about two billion people
all over the world that looks like us.

907
01:14:30,804 --> 01:14:32,764
But their lives are a lot harder.

908
01:14:32,931 --> 01:14:35,225
Wakanda has the tools
to liberate 'em all.

909
01:14:35,392 --> 01:14:37,603
And what tools are those?

910
01:14:38,187 --> 01:14:40,856
Vibranium. Your weapons.

911
01:14:41,023 --> 01:14:44,651
Our weapons will not be used
to wage war on the world.

912
01:14:44,943 --> 01:14:48,572
It is not our way to be judge,
jury and executioner...

913
01:14:48,739 --> 01:14:50,574
for people who are not our own.

914
01:14:51,158 --> 01:14:52,618
Not your own?

915
01:14:52,784 --> 01:14:55,245
But didn't life start right here
on this continent?

916
01:14:55,412 --> 01:14:56,830
So ain't all people your people?

917
01:14:56,997 --> 01:15:00,626
I am not king of all people.
I am king of Wakanda.

918
01:15:01,502 --> 01:15:05,339
And it is my responsibility to make sure
our people are safe...

919
01:15:05,506 --> 01:15:09,593
and that vibranium does not fall
into the hands of a person like you.

920
01:15:09,760 --> 01:15:10,761
Son.

921
01:15:11,303 --> 01:15:15,557
We have entertained this charlatan
for too long. Reject his request.

922
01:15:15,724 --> 01:15:18,227
Oh, I ain't requesting nothing.

923
01:15:18,393 --> 01:15:21,063
-Ask who I am.
-You're Erik Stevens.

924
01:15:22,523 --> 01:15:23,899
An American black operative.

925
01:15:24,066 --> 01:15:26,860
A mercenary nicknamed Killmonger.
That's who you are.

926
01:15:27,027 --> 01:15:28,570
That's not my name, Princess.

927
01:15:29,071 --> 01:15:30,322
Ask me, King.

928
01:15:30,489 --> 01:15:31,657
No.

929
01:15:32,783 --> 01:15:33,909
Ask me.

930
01:15:36,245 --> 01:15:37,663
Take him away.

931
01:15:39,122 --> 01:15:40,123
Who are you?

932
01:15:40,332 --> 01:15:44,586
I am N'Jadaka, son of Prince N'Jobu.

933
01:15:45,712 --> 01:15:46,755
Son of N'Jobu?

934
01:15:46,922 --> 01:15:48,924
I found my daddy
with Panther claws in his chest!

935
01:15:49,091 --> 01:15:51,176
You ain't the son of a king.
You a son of a murderer.

936
01:15:51,343 --> 01:15:52,469
You're lying!

937
01:15:52,636 --> 01:15:54,596
-Lies!
-I'm afraid not, Queen Mother.

938
01:15:57,349 --> 01:15:58,183
What?

939
01:15:59,560 --> 01:16:01,812
The descendent of N'Jobu.

940
01:16:02,104 --> 01:16:03,522
Hey, Auntie.

941
01:16:07,025 --> 01:16:10,696
I'm exercising my blood right
to challenge for the mantles of king...

942
01:16:10,863 --> 01:16:12,447
and Black Panther.

943
01:16:17,160 --> 01:16:18,537
Do not do this, T'Challa.

944
01:16:18,704 --> 01:16:22,583
As the son of Prince N'Jobu,
he is within his rights.

945
01:16:22,749 --> 01:16:24,042
He has no rights here!

946
01:16:24,209 --> 01:16:26,295
The challenge will take weeks
to prepare.

947
01:16:26,461 --> 01:16:29,673
Weeks? I don't need weeks.

948
01:16:29,840 --> 01:16:32,092
The whole country ain't gotta be there.
I just need him.

949
01:16:32,259 --> 01:16:34,428
And somebody to get me
outta these chains.

950
01:16:38,473 --> 01:16:41,351
T'Challa, what do you know of this?

951
01:16:42,644 --> 01:16:45,105
I accept your challenge.

952
01:17:03,248 --> 01:17:04,625
He'll never beat T'Challa.

953
01:17:04,791 --> 01:17:08,712
He should've just come to the
first challenge and gotten it over with.

954
01:17:14,718 --> 01:17:19,932
The king will now have the strength
of the Black Panther stripped away.

955
01:17:51,922 --> 01:17:53,215
Where is Agent Ross?

956
01:17:53,382 --> 01:17:56,134
I locked him in the office.
He's not going anywhere.

957
01:18:00,597 --> 01:18:02,516
This is your last chance.

958
01:18:04,518 --> 01:18:09,064
Throw down your weapons,
and we can handle this another way.

959
01:18:16,446 --> 01:18:20,409
I lived my entire life
waitin' for this moment.

960
01:18:20,576 --> 01:18:24,288
I trained, I lied, I killed...

961
01:18:24,454 --> 01:18:26,164
just to get here.

962
01:18:26,957 --> 01:18:30,544
I killed in America, Afghanistan...

963
01:18:32,421 --> 01:18:33,463
Iraq.

964
01:18:35,048 --> 01:18:38,177
I took life from my own brothers
and sisters right here on this continent.

965
01:18:40,888 --> 01:18:42,306
And all this death...

966
01:18:43,515 --> 01:18:45,893
just so I could kill you.

967
01:18:53,525 --> 01:18:56,737
Let the challenge begin.

968
01:19:35,317 --> 01:19:36,318
Yield!

969
01:19:58,090 --> 01:19:59,424
Snap out of it, Tâ€™Challa!

970
01:20:19,903 --> 01:20:20,821
Come on, get up.

971
01:20:22,155 --> 01:20:23,156
Come here.

972
01:20:26,869 --> 01:20:28,161
This is for my father.

973
01:20:29,621 --> 01:20:30,289
Erik!

974
01:20:31,623 --> 01:20:33,333
-Zuri, no.
-Stop!

975
01:20:33,709 --> 01:20:34,918
-Zuri!
-Zuri, don't!

976
01:20:35,085 --> 01:20:37,087
I am the cause of your father's death.

977
01:20:37,254 --> 01:20:38,463
Not him.

978
01:20:39,006 --> 01:20:40,174
Take me.

979
01:20:41,508 --> 01:20:43,093
I'll take you both, Uncle James.

980
01:20:44,011 --> 01:20:44,720
No!

981
01:20:45,679 --> 01:20:48,140
No! No!

982
01:20:50,017 --> 01:20:50,851
Zuri, no!

983
01:20:52,186 --> 01:20:53,187
No!

984
01:20:53,562 --> 01:20:57,024
No! No! Zuri! Zuri!

985
01:20:57,524 --> 01:20:59,359
No! No!

986
01:21:02,571 --> 01:21:03,739
Is this your king?

987
01:21:07,117 --> 01:21:08,410
Is this your king?

988
01:21:14,750 --> 01:21:18,128
The Black Panther, who's supposed
to lead you into the future?

989
01:21:18,295 --> 01:21:19,796
Come on, Brother!

990
01:21:19,963 --> 01:21:21,256
Is there nothing that can be done?

991
01:21:23,884 --> 01:21:24,760
Him?

992
01:21:25,844 --> 01:21:26,887
He's supposed to protect you?

993
01:21:39,441 --> 01:21:40,901
-No.
-No!

994
01:21:48,408 --> 01:21:50,327
No!

995
01:21:53,497 --> 01:21:55,916
Nah. I'm your king.

996
01:21:56,083 --> 01:21:57,751
-No! No!
-We have to go now!

997
01:21:57,918 --> 01:22:00,003
Queen Mother, let's go!

998
01:22:35,831 --> 01:22:37,541
The Queen Mother and Shuri,
they are safe?

999
01:22:37,708 --> 01:22:38,709
Yes.

1000
01:22:39,459 --> 01:22:40,836
Thank you.

1001
01:22:41,003 --> 01:22:43,380
We should get to them immediately.

1002
01:22:43,797 --> 01:22:45,424
I cannot.

1003
01:22:45,591 --> 01:22:46,175
What?

1004
01:22:46,341 --> 01:22:47,759
Though my heart is with you.

1005
01:22:49,178 --> 01:22:53,265
We cannot turn over our nation to a man
who showed up here only hours ago.

1006
01:22:53,432 --> 01:22:54,308
He is of royal blood.

1007
01:22:54,474 --> 01:22:56,768
-He killed T'Challa!
-In ritual combat.

1008
01:22:56,935 --> 01:22:58,770
Does that really matter?

1009
01:23:01,440 --> 01:23:04,359
You are the greatest warrior Wakanda has.

1010
01:23:04,735 --> 01:23:08,530
Help me overthrow him
before he becomes too strong.

1011
01:23:08,697 --> 01:23:09,823
Overthrow?

1012
01:23:10,741 --> 01:23:11,867
Nakia!

1013
01:23:13,327 --> 01:23:16,079
I'm not a spy who can come
and go as they so choose!

1014
01:23:17,831 --> 01:23:22,294
I am loyal to that throne,
no matter who sits upon it.

1015
01:23:22,920 --> 01:23:24,630
What are you loyal to?

1016
01:23:28,091 --> 01:23:29,510
I loved him.

1017
01:23:30,928 --> 01:23:33,222
I loved my country, too.

1018
01:23:33,388 --> 01:23:35,432
Then you serve your country.

1019
01:23:35,599 --> 01:23:38,769
No. I save my country.

1020
01:23:47,819 --> 01:23:48,862
What's wrong?

1021
01:23:49,196 --> 01:23:50,614
The king is dead.

1022
01:23:51,990 --> 01:23:53,909
Come with me,
unless you want to join him.

1023
01:24:13,887 --> 01:24:15,222
First Baba.

1024
01:24:16,723 --> 01:24:18,308
And now my brother.

1025
01:24:21,144 --> 01:24:23,981
Mama, we didn't even get to bury him.

1026
01:24:31,363 --> 01:24:34,241
-It's me.
-Nakia. Who is this man?

1027
01:24:34,408 --> 01:24:36,243
He's a friend of T'Challa's.
He saved my life.

1028
01:24:37,536 --> 01:24:38,370
Where's Okoye?

1029
01:24:38,537 --> 01:24:39,621
Okoye is not coming.

1030
01:24:39,788 --> 01:24:42,541
She and the Dora Milaje
will serve the new king.

1031
01:24:48,463 --> 01:24:49,798
Wait here.

1032
01:24:53,468 --> 01:24:56,180
What has happened to our Wakanda?

1033
01:24:58,557 --> 01:25:00,684
Allow the Heart-Shaped Herb...

1034
01:25:00,851 --> 01:25:03,812
to give you the powers
of the Black Panther...

1035
01:25:03,979 --> 01:25:06,773
and take you to the Ancestral Plane.

1036
01:26:41,952 --> 01:26:44,746
What did I tell you
about going into my things?

1037
01:26:53,046 --> 01:26:54,339
What did you find?

1038
01:26:55,257 --> 01:26:56,675
Your home.

1039
01:26:59,011 --> 01:27:02,014
I gave you a key
hoping that you might see it someday.

1040
01:27:03,932 --> 01:27:07,936
Yes. The sunsets there
are the most beautiful in the world.

1041
01:27:10,272 --> 01:27:12,357
But I fear you still may not be welcome.

1042
01:27:15,110 --> 01:27:16,111
Why?

1043
01:27:18,280 --> 01:27:19,948
They will say you are lost.

1044
01:27:20,532 --> 01:27:22,201
But I'm right here.

1045
01:27:27,247 --> 01:27:28,957
No tears for me?

1046
01:27:32,878 --> 01:27:34,505
Everybody dies.

1047
01:27:36,548 --> 01:27:38,300
It's just life around here.

1048
01:27:42,721 --> 01:27:44,598
Well, look at what I have done.

1049
01:27:46,183 --> 01:27:48,685
I should've taken you back long ago.

1050
01:27:51,522 --> 01:27:53,941
Instead, we are both abandoned here.

1051
01:27:59,071 --> 01:28:01,657
Well, maybe your home
is the one that's lost.

1052
01:28:03,659 --> 01:28:06,078
That's why they can't find us.

1053
01:28:13,085 --> 01:28:15,504
Breathe! Breathe, My King, breathe.

1054
01:28:15,671 --> 01:28:18,048
Breathe. Breathe. Breathe.

1055
01:28:34,857 --> 01:28:36,650
The Heart-Shaped Herb did that?

1056
01:28:39,695 --> 01:28:40,737
This all of it?

1057
01:28:40,904 --> 01:28:43,991
Yes. So when it comes time
for another king, we will be ready.

1058
01:28:44,658 --> 01:28:45,909
Another king?

1059
01:28:48,036 --> 01:28:50,163
Yeah, go ahead and burn all that.

1060
01:28:50,330 --> 01:28:52,916
My King, we cannot do that.
It is our tradition...

1061
01:28:56,587 --> 01:28:59,548
When I tell you to do something,
I mean that shit.

1062
01:29:03,468 --> 01:29:05,012
Burn it all!

1063
01:29:54,144 --> 01:29:55,646
You know, where I'm from...

1064
01:29:56,605 --> 01:30:00,567
when black folks started revolutions,
they never had the firepower...

1065
01:30:00,734 --> 01:30:02,819
or the resources
to fight their oppressors.

1066
01:30:03,445 --> 01:30:05,072
Where was Wakanda?

1067
01:30:11,203 --> 01:30:12,913
Yeah, all that ends today.

1068
01:30:13,080 --> 01:30:16,208
We got spies embedded
in every nation on Earth.

1069
01:30:16,375 --> 01:30:18,085
Already in place.

1070
01:30:18,252 --> 01:30:19,586
I know how colonizers think.

1071
01:30:19,753 --> 01:30:22,297
So we're gonna use their own strategy
against 'em.

1072
01:30:23,298 --> 01:30:26,176
We're gonna send vibranium weapons
out to our War Dogs.

1073
01:30:26,343 --> 01:30:29,054
They'll arm oppressed people
all over the world...

1074
01:30:29,221 --> 01:30:31,640
so they can finally rise up
and kill those in power.

1075
01:30:31,807 --> 01:30:35,310
And their children.
And anyone else who takes their side.

1076
01:30:35,477 --> 01:30:37,938
It's time they know the truth about us!

1077
01:30:38,105 --> 01:30:39,731
We're warriors!

1078
01:30:39,898 --> 01:30:43,068
The world's gonna start over,
and this time, we're on top.

1079
01:30:44,611 --> 01:30:47,990
The sun will never set
on the Wakandan empire.

1080
01:30:48,740 --> 01:30:51,410
Wakanda has survived for so long...

1081
01:30:51,577 --> 01:30:54,872
by fighting when only
absolutely necessary.

1082
01:30:55,038 --> 01:30:57,666
Wakanda survived
in the past this way, yes.

1083
01:30:59,209 --> 01:31:01,420
But the world is changing, General.

1084
01:31:02,171 --> 01:31:05,591
Elders, it is getting smaller.

1085
01:31:05,757 --> 01:31:07,634
The outside world is catching up...

1086
01:31:07,801 --> 01:31:11,972
and soon it will be the conquerors
or the conquered.

1087
01:31:13,932 --> 01:31:15,601
I'd rather be the former.

1088
01:31:17,769 --> 01:31:20,606
You heard your orders. Let's get to it.

1089
01:31:22,149 --> 01:31:23,358
So where are we going again?

1090
01:31:23,525 --> 01:31:26,236
We're taking the Heart-Shaped Herb
to Jabariland.

1091
01:31:26,403 --> 01:31:28,030
Heart-Shaped Herb? What is that?

1092
01:31:28,197 --> 01:31:30,616
It gives whoever takes it
heightened abilities.

1093
01:31:30,782 --> 01:31:33,368
It's what made T'Challa so strong.

1094
01:31:33,911 --> 01:31:34,953
Nakia.

1095
01:31:39,333 --> 01:31:41,210
I don't like this.

1096
01:31:41,376 --> 01:31:43,128
The Herb belongs to us.

1097
01:31:43,295 --> 01:31:46,507
We may be creating a bigger monster
with M'Baku.

1098
01:31:52,596 --> 01:31:56,350
Nakia, you should take it yourself.

1099
01:31:56,934 --> 01:32:00,312
I am a spy with no army.

1100
01:32:01,688 --> 01:32:03,440
I wouldn't stand a chance.

1101
01:32:05,234 --> 01:32:06,735
We'll go.

1102
01:32:13,367 --> 01:32:14,660
Oh, boy.

1103
01:32:19,957 --> 01:32:21,291
Oh, shit.

1104
01:32:22,417 --> 01:32:24,294
Look down. Stay calm.

1105
01:32:24,461 --> 01:32:25,462
Shuri.

1106
01:32:26,755 --> 01:32:28,173
Look down.

1107
01:33:03,500 --> 01:33:04,793
My son...

1108
01:33:06,795 --> 01:33:09,464
was murdered in ritual combat.

1109
01:33:09,923 --> 01:33:12,092
-Were the odds fair?
-Yes, but...

1110
01:33:12,259 --> 01:33:13,844
So it was less a murder than a defeat.

1111
01:33:14,011 --> 01:33:15,888
-Do not rub our noses in it!
-Silence!

1112
01:33:17,055 --> 01:33:19,641
I make the pronouncements here, girl.

1113
01:33:19,808 --> 01:33:23,562
Look, Your Highness,
the new king is a U.S....

1114
01:33:24,479 --> 01:33:25,647
The new king...

1115
01:33:34,281 --> 01:33:36,491
You cannot talk!

1116
01:33:36,658 --> 01:33:40,370
One more word,
and I will feed you to my children.

1117
01:33:44,541 --> 01:33:46,752
I'm kidding. We are vegetarians.

1118
01:33:54,051 --> 01:33:57,262
Great Gorilla M'Baku...

1119
01:33:59,765 --> 01:34:03,060
this is why we are here.

1120
01:34:03,852 --> 01:34:06,021
To offer this to you.

1121
01:34:06,772 --> 01:34:09,149
An outsider sits on our throne.

1122
01:34:09,316 --> 01:34:11,151
Only you can help us stop him.

1123
01:34:28,752 --> 01:34:30,045
Come with me.

1124
01:34:47,104 --> 01:34:48,438
Impossible!

1125
01:34:54,319 --> 01:34:55,362
Is he breathing?

1126
01:34:55,529 --> 01:34:58,282
He's in a coma. Barely clinging to life.

1127
01:34:58,657 --> 01:35:02,035
One of our fishermen found him
at the edge of the river border.

1128
01:35:02,202 --> 01:35:03,495
He brought him to me.

1129
01:35:03,662 --> 01:35:05,414
Why do you have him in the snow?

1130
01:35:05,581 --> 01:35:07,875
It is the only thing keeping him
from joining the ancestors.

1131
01:35:08,041 --> 01:35:10,586
We need to get him to my lab.
I can heal him there.

1132
01:35:10,752 --> 01:35:12,296
Take him. He'll be dead in seconds.

1133
01:35:14,006 --> 01:35:15,632
Nakia, the Herb.

1134
01:35:32,524 --> 01:35:34,484
I call upon the ancestors.

1135
01:35:34,943 --> 01:35:36,904
I call upon Bast.

1136
01:35:37,404 --> 01:35:40,365
I am here with my son, T'Challa.

1137
01:35:41,408 --> 01:35:42,868
Heal him.

1138
01:35:54,796 --> 01:35:57,758
We must bury him.
Cover him. Cover him!

1139
01:35:57,925 --> 01:35:59,176
Okay.

1140
01:36:11,271 --> 01:36:12,606
Praise the ancestors.

1141
01:36:12,773 --> 01:36:13,774
Praise the ancestors.

1142
01:36:14,900 --> 01:36:16,360
Praise the ancestors.

1143
01:36:17,402 --> 01:36:18,820
Praise the ancestors.

1144
01:36:19,613 --> 01:36:21,365
Wake up, T'Challa.

1145
01:36:22,574 --> 01:36:23,909
Wake up.

1146
01:36:26,411 --> 01:36:27,746
My son.

1147
01:36:34,169 --> 01:36:37,047
The time has come
for you to come home...

1148
01:36:37,214 --> 01:36:39,633
and be reunited with me.

1149
01:36:50,602 --> 01:36:52,020
Why?

1150
01:36:54,147 --> 01:36:57,234
Why didn't you bring the boy home?

1151
01:36:58,986 --> 01:37:00,487
Why, Baba?

1152
01:37:04,491 --> 01:37:07,786
He was the truth I chose to omit.

1153
01:37:08,912 --> 01:37:11,540
You were wrong to abandon him.

1154
01:37:11,707 --> 01:37:13,584
I chose my people.

1155
01:37:14,418 --> 01:37:16,962
I chose Wakanda.

1156
01:37:17,129 --> 01:37:19,006
Our future depended...

1157
01:37:19,173 --> 01:37:20,716
You were wrong!

1158
01:37:20,883 --> 01:37:23,135
All of you were wrong!

1159
01:37:24,178 --> 01:37:27,097
To turn your backs
on the rest of the world!

1160
01:37:29,433 --> 01:37:34,021
We let the fear of our discovery stop us
from doing what is right!

1161
01:37:35,105 --> 01:37:36,440
No more!

1162
01:37:40,235 --> 01:37:43,989
I cannot stay here with you.

1163
01:37:45,782 --> 01:37:50,037
I cannot rest
while he sits on the throne.

1164
01:37:50,537 --> 01:37:53,582
He is a monster of our own making.

1165
01:37:55,250 --> 01:37:58,587
I must take the mantle back. I must!

1166
01:38:00,631 --> 01:38:03,300
I must right these wrongs.

1167
01:38:14,144 --> 01:38:15,812
Do you have a blanket?

1168
01:38:18,607 --> 01:38:21,693
Killmonger has the full support
of our military.

1169
01:38:23,820 --> 01:38:25,989
And he burned the garden
of the Heart-Shaped Herb.

1170
01:38:27,074 --> 01:38:30,077
Of course he did.
That's what he was trained to do.

1171
01:38:30,244 --> 01:38:33,789
His unit used to work with the CIA
to destabilize foreign countries.

1172
01:38:33,956 --> 01:38:36,041
They would always strike
at transitions of power...

1173
01:38:36,208 --> 01:38:38,377
like an election year,
or the death of a monarch.

1174
01:38:38,544 --> 01:38:40,921
You get control of government,
the military...

1175
01:38:41,088 --> 01:38:43,173
-Our resources.
-Right.

1176
01:38:44,299 --> 01:38:45,300
The Great Mound.

1177
01:38:45,467 --> 01:38:47,135
Our vibranium, all of my designs.

1178
01:38:47,302 --> 01:38:49,972
He will send our weapons
all over the world.

1179
01:38:53,308 --> 01:38:55,602
You must get them out of Wakanda safely.

1180
01:38:55,769 --> 01:38:56,770
-What?
-What about you?

1181
01:38:57,688 --> 01:38:59,648
The challenge will have to continue.

1182
01:38:59,815 --> 01:39:03,110
T'Challa, we will not leave Wakanda.

1183
01:39:03,277 --> 01:39:05,279
It is my duty to keep you safe.

1184
01:39:05,445 --> 01:39:09,366
If he gets control of our technology,
nowhere will be safe.

1185
01:39:30,012 --> 01:39:31,930
The Black Panther lives.

1186
01:39:32,890 --> 01:39:34,975
And when he fights
for the fate of Wakanda...

1187
01:39:35,142 --> 01:39:37,686
I will be right there beside him.

1188
01:39:38,812 --> 01:39:40,022
As will I.

1189
01:39:40,480 --> 01:39:41,732
I'm in, too.

1190
01:39:43,483 --> 01:39:45,569
What? You're gonna need all the help
you can get.

1191
01:39:48,864 --> 01:39:50,282
Are you done?

1192
01:39:51,450 --> 01:39:53,493
Are you done?

1193
01:39:55,037 --> 01:39:58,207
Could you give me and Lord M'Baku
a moment?

1194
01:40:06,715 --> 01:40:07,841
Thank you.

1195
01:40:08,509 --> 01:40:10,761
I owed you a great debt.

1196
01:40:11,553 --> 01:40:13,138
A life for a life.

1197
01:40:13,305 --> 01:40:14,848
Consider it paid.

1198
01:40:15,516 --> 01:40:17,726
Please allow my mother to stay here.

1199
01:40:18,519 --> 01:40:21,438
No harm will come to her.
I give you my word.

1200
01:40:22,606 --> 01:40:25,275
You know, I could use an army as well.

1201
01:40:25,442 --> 01:40:27,027
I bet you could.

1202
01:40:28,153 --> 01:40:29,404
But no.

1203
01:40:31,073 --> 01:40:33,700
I will give no Jabari lives
towards your cause.

1204
01:40:33,867 --> 01:40:35,536
It is our cause.

1205
01:40:35,994 --> 01:40:38,455
-It is for all of us.
-Us?

1206
01:40:38,622 --> 01:40:40,874
Us? You are the first king
to come here in centuries...

1207
01:40:41,041 --> 01:40:45,003
and now you speak of "us"?

1208
01:40:46,296 --> 01:40:48,966
I cannot speak for past kings.

1209
01:40:49,591 --> 01:40:52,469
But an enemy sits on the throne
right now.

1210
01:40:52,636 --> 01:40:55,514
We both know the power of vibranium.

1211
01:40:56,181 --> 01:41:00,310
If Killmonger gains control of it,
who do you think he will come for next?

1212
01:41:07,025 --> 01:41:11,321
We will not help you.

1213
01:41:39,933 --> 01:41:41,101
Everything is on schedule.

1214
01:41:41,268 --> 01:41:42,436
Have the spies been alerted?

1215
01:41:42,603 --> 01:41:44,730
Yes. Some resistance to our new mission.

1216
01:41:45,105 --> 01:41:48,483
But the War Dogs in London, New York
and Hong Kong are standing by.

1217
01:41:50,152 --> 01:41:51,778
We'll strike there first.

1218
01:41:51,945 --> 01:41:53,739
The others'll come around.

1219
01:41:53,906 --> 01:41:55,282
Look at this.

1220
01:41:55,449 --> 01:41:57,993
A handheld sonic cannon,
powerful enough to stop a tank...

1221
01:41:58,160 --> 01:41:59,786
untraceable by metal detectors.

1222
01:41:59,953 --> 01:42:01,997
And we got thousands of them.

1223
01:42:04,166 --> 01:42:07,294
The world's gonna find out
exactly who we are.

1224
01:42:38,825 --> 01:42:40,035
He lives.

1225
01:42:44,081 --> 01:42:45,999
N'Jadaka!

1226
01:42:47,209 --> 01:42:48,460
Wassup?

1227
01:42:48,627 --> 01:42:50,379
I never yielded!

1228
01:42:51,129 --> 01:42:54,842
And as you can see, I am not dead!

1229
01:42:55,384 --> 01:42:58,679
All that challenge shit is over with!
I'm the king now!

1230
01:42:58,846 --> 01:43:01,056
Get those planes in the air!
Carry out the mission!

1231
01:43:09,523 --> 01:43:11,108
-Shuri, now.
-Copy that.

1232
01:43:14,486 --> 01:43:17,197
Go, go, go! Come on, Ross!

1233
01:43:17,364 --> 01:43:19,825
W'Kabi, man, kill this clown.

1234
01:43:20,951 --> 01:43:24,037
W'Kabi, the challenge is not complete.

1235
01:43:28,083 --> 01:43:29,251
What will we do?

1236
01:43:30,669 --> 01:43:31,753
Border Tribe!

1237
01:43:45,893 --> 01:43:46,810
You!

1238
01:43:46,977 --> 01:43:49,313
Your heart is so full of hatred...

1239
01:43:49,479 --> 01:43:51,315
you are not fit to be a king!

1240
01:43:55,694 --> 01:43:56,695
Come on!

1241
01:43:56,778 --> 01:43:57,779
Ayo, the king!

1242
01:44:13,587 --> 01:44:14,630
Shields!

1243
01:44:49,748 --> 01:44:51,083
W'Kabi, stop this!

1244
01:44:52,334 --> 01:44:53,836
Stop this now!

1245
01:44:58,006 --> 01:44:58,674
No!

1246
01:45:27,369 --> 01:45:29,830
Nakia and I will get control
of the Royal Talon with this.

1247
01:45:29,997 --> 01:45:31,456
So what do I do?

1248
01:45:31,623 --> 01:45:32,708
You'll have to fly it.

1249
01:45:33,584 --> 01:45:35,502
-What?
-You were a great pilot.

1250
01:45:35,669 --> 01:45:37,713
Don't worry, I'll guide you through it.

1251
01:45:37,880 --> 01:45:40,007
It's just like riding a hoverbike.

1252
01:45:40,716 --> 01:45:42,384
What? You guys have hoverbikes?

1253
01:45:42,551 --> 01:45:44,344
Hey, Nakia, take that.

1254
01:45:44,511 --> 01:45:47,264
-I'm not a Dora.
-Just put it on, it's armor!

1255
01:45:48,765 --> 01:45:49,808
Come!

1256
01:45:52,227 --> 01:45:53,395
Good luck, Agent Ross!

1257
01:45:53,562 --> 01:45:54,897
Yeah, I don't know what
I'm doing with this.

1258
01:45:54,980 --> 01:45:55,981
We're counting on you.

1259
01:46:09,077 --> 01:46:10,454
Wakanda forever.

1260
01:46:18,670 --> 01:46:19,630
Come on!

1261
01:46:30,182 --> 01:46:31,308
Go, go!

1262
01:46:37,189 --> 01:46:40,067
Remote piloting system activated.

1263
01:46:41,109 --> 01:46:42,110
My God.

1264
01:46:42,277 --> 01:46:45,322
I made it American style for you.
Get in.

1265
01:46:45,489 --> 01:46:47,032
All right.

1266
01:46:53,413 --> 01:46:54,206
Yes!

1267
01:46:56,291 --> 01:46:59,002
Go! We can't let those weapons
get beyond Wakanda.

1268
01:47:01,004 --> 01:47:02,047
All right, I'm on it.

1269
01:47:19,189 --> 01:47:20,440
Lock!

1270
01:47:21,108 --> 01:47:22,234
Get him down!

1271
01:47:23,026 --> 01:47:24,611
Get the necklace!

1272
01:47:25,070 --> 01:47:26,655
Get the necklace!

1273
01:47:33,328 --> 01:47:35,414
Wakanda forever!

1274
01:47:43,213 --> 01:47:45,465
Okay, Shuri. I got 'em. What do I do?

1275
01:47:45,632 --> 01:47:47,009
Shoot them down, genius!

1276
01:47:47,176 --> 01:47:48,010
All right.

1277
01:47:49,803 --> 01:47:50,846
Here goes nothing.

1278
01:47:58,103 --> 01:47:59,229
All right, got them.

1279
01:48:03,567 --> 01:48:04,818
Oh, shit.

1280
01:48:05,777 --> 01:48:07,529
Shit, shit, shit.

1281
01:48:27,799 --> 01:48:28,884
Nice!

1282
01:49:04,127 --> 01:49:05,170
Shuri!

1283
01:49:09,466 --> 01:49:10,843
What's up, Princess?

1284
01:49:11,009 --> 01:49:13,095
You'll never be a true king.

1285
01:49:16,056 --> 01:49:16,932
Brother!

1286
01:49:49,214 --> 01:49:50,507
Shuri.

1287
01:49:51,049 --> 01:49:51,925
Brother!

1288
01:49:52,801 --> 01:49:54,469
Turn on the train on the bottom track.

1289
01:49:54,636 --> 01:49:56,680
The stabilizers will deactivate your suit!

1290
01:49:56,847 --> 01:49:58,182
You won't have protection!

1291
01:49:58,348 --> 01:49:59,683
Neither will he.

1292
01:49:59,850 --> 01:50:00,559
Okay!

1293
01:50:25,292 --> 01:50:27,544
I don't need a suit to kill you.

1294
01:50:27,711 --> 01:50:28,921
Your reign is over!

1295
01:50:29,087 --> 01:50:30,672
You sat up here, safe and protected.

1296
01:50:30,839 --> 01:50:34,259
You want to see us become
just like the people you hate so much.

1297
01:50:34,426 --> 01:50:36,178
Divide and conquer the land as they did!

1298
01:50:36,345 --> 01:50:38,764
Nah, I learn from my enemies.
Beat them at they own game.

1299
01:50:38,931 --> 01:50:40,182
You have become them!

1300
01:50:40,474 --> 01:50:42,851
You will destroy the world,
Wakanda included!

1301
01:50:43,018 --> 01:50:44,770
The world took everything away from me!

1302
01:50:44,937 --> 01:50:46,438
Everything I ever loved!

1303
01:50:46,605 --> 01:50:48,065
But I'mma make sure we're even.

1304
01:50:48,232 --> 01:50:50,943
I'mma track down anyone who would even
think about being loyal to you!

1305
01:50:51,109 --> 01:50:53,612
And I'm gonna put they ass in the dirt
right next to Zuri!

1306
01:50:55,697 --> 01:50:57,199
Nakia!

1307
01:51:00,327 --> 01:51:02,120
-Are you all right?
-I'm okay. You?

1308
01:51:02,287 --> 01:51:03,038
Yes.

1309
01:51:03,205 --> 01:51:04,039
Let's go.

1310
01:51:11,171 --> 01:51:13,465
Shuri, I've lost one of them,
but two are on my tail.

1311
01:51:15,884 --> 01:51:17,094
Shit. What the hell was that?

1312
01:51:17,261 --> 01:51:18,595
The lab is under attack.

1313
01:51:18,762 --> 01:51:19,638
What? Where?

1314
01:51:19,805 --> 01:51:21,723
Deactivating hologram.

1315
01:51:25,769 --> 01:51:28,605
Ross, you have to get out of there, now!

1316
01:51:29,189 --> 01:51:30,566
How long have I got?

1317
01:51:31,275 --> 01:51:34,319
Glass integrity is at 50%.

1318
01:51:35,112 --> 01:51:36,154
Put me back in.

1319
01:51:36,321 --> 01:51:38,031
Ross! Ross!

1320
01:51:56,925 --> 01:51:58,427
Surrender now!

1321
01:51:58,886 --> 01:52:01,763
You have three seconds
to lay down your weapon!

1322
01:52:01,930 --> 01:52:03,056
One!

1323
01:52:03,223 --> 01:52:04,183
Two!

1324
01:52:14,234 --> 01:52:18,488
Witness the might of the Jabari
firsthand!

1325
01:52:59,571 --> 01:53:01,907
Glass integrity is at 15%.

1326
01:53:10,791 --> 01:53:12,751
-Critical weapons failure.
-Shit!

1327
01:53:17,965 --> 01:53:20,926
Hey, Shuri! The last cargo ship
is almost at the border...

1328
01:53:21,093 --> 01:53:22,261
but they got me trapped
with some kind of cables.

1329
01:53:22,427 --> 01:53:23,720
Make an X with your arms!

1330
01:53:24,513 --> 01:53:26,723
Sonic Overload initiated.

1331
01:53:27,516 --> 01:53:28,725
Now break it!

1332
01:53:37,651 --> 01:53:39,570
System rebooting in five...

1333
01:53:40,028 --> 01:53:42,114
four, three...

1334
01:53:42,281 --> 01:53:43,907
two, one.

1335
01:53:44,491 --> 01:53:45,617
System rebooted.

1336
01:53:57,921 --> 01:53:59,256
Yes! We did it!

1337
01:53:59,423 --> 01:54:00,966
Great! Now get out of there!

1338
01:54:12,144 --> 01:54:13,437
Charge!

1339
01:54:33,248 --> 01:54:35,584
Drop your weapon!

1340
01:54:37,127 --> 01:54:39,296
Would you kill me, my love?

1341
01:54:39,463 --> 01:54:40,923
For Wakanda?

1342
01:54:44,218 --> 01:54:45,928
Without question!

1343
01:55:29,930 --> 01:55:31,473
This is it for you, Cousin.

1344
01:55:57,207 --> 01:55:58,750
Hell of a move!

1345
01:56:19,938 --> 01:56:23,192
My pop said Wakanda was
the most beautiful thing he ever seen.

1346
01:56:26,904 --> 01:56:29,406
He promised he was gonna show it
to me one day.

1347
01:56:31,074 --> 01:56:32,659
You believe that?

1348
01:56:33,535 --> 01:56:36,622
Kid from Oakland,
running around believing in fairy tales.

1349
01:57:25,003 --> 01:57:26,922
It's beautiful.

1350
01:57:41,103 --> 01:57:43,522
Maybe we can still heal you.

1351
01:57:45,941 --> 01:57:47,109
Why?

1352
01:57:48,902 --> 01:57:51,113
So you can just lock me up?

1353
01:57:54,366 --> 01:57:55,701
Nah.

1354
01:57:57,911 --> 01:57:59,580
Just bury me in the ocean...

1355
01:57:59,746 --> 01:58:02,291
with my ancestors
that jumped from the ships.

1356
01:58:03,125 --> 01:58:06,503
'Cause they knew
death was better than bondage.

1357
01:59:31,046 --> 01:59:32,047
Thank you.

1358
01:59:34,049 --> 01:59:35,634
You saved me.

1359
01:59:36,552 --> 01:59:38,679
You saved my family.

1360
01:59:40,889 --> 01:59:42,307
Our nation.

1361
01:59:42,474 --> 01:59:44,810
There's nothing to thank me for.

1362
01:59:44,977 --> 01:59:46,520
It is our duty to...

1363
01:59:50,148 --> 01:59:52,818
It was my duty to fight for what I love.

1364
01:59:53,861 --> 01:59:54,862
I should've...

1365
02:00:01,577 --> 02:00:03,787
You can't blame me, I almost died.

1366
02:00:07,457 --> 02:00:08,709
Stay.

1367
02:00:11,170 --> 02:00:14,756
I think I know a way
you can still fulfill your calling.

1368
02:00:15,924 --> 02:00:17,342
Please stay.

1369
02:00:50,459 --> 02:00:52,211
Oh, he moves it! He moves it!

1370
02:00:52,377 --> 02:00:54,046
-Who man is that?
-Bucket!

1371
02:00:54,213 --> 02:00:55,214
Easy.

1372
02:00:58,217 --> 02:01:01,553
When you said you would take me
to California for the first time...

1373
02:01:01,720 --> 02:01:03,680
I thought you meant Coachella...

1374
02:01:03,847 --> 02:01:05,307
or Disneyland.

1375
02:01:05,974 --> 02:01:07,392
Why here?

1376
02:01:10,521 --> 02:01:13,982
This is where our father killed our uncle.

1377
02:01:19,196 --> 02:01:20,948
They're tearing it down.

1378
02:01:22,032 --> 02:01:23,033
Good.

1379
02:01:23,200 --> 02:01:25,202
They are not tearing it down.

1380
02:01:26,328 --> 02:01:27,955
I bought this building.

1381
02:01:29,998 --> 02:01:31,917
And that building.

1382
02:01:32,751 --> 02:01:34,503
And that one over there.

1383
02:01:35,712 --> 02:01:39,424
This will be the first
Wakandan International Outreach Center.

1384
02:01:40,676 --> 02:01:43,345
Nakia will oversee the social outreach.

1385
02:01:44,096 --> 02:01:47,599
And you will spearhead
the science and information exchange.

1386
02:01:49,184 --> 02:01:50,269
You're kidding.

1387
02:02:02,322 --> 02:02:05,242
Hey, yo. Man, what the hell is that?

1388
02:02:05,409 --> 02:02:07,119
That's like a Bugatti spaceship!

1389
02:02:07,286 --> 02:02:09,872
Bro, it came out of nowhere.
Did y'all see that?

1390
02:02:13,000 --> 02:02:14,168
What?

1391
02:02:16,003 --> 02:02:17,004
Check it out, bro.

1392
02:02:17,171 --> 02:02:18,547
We can take this back to the house.

1393
02:02:19,840 --> 02:02:21,008
Pull up to school in this.

1394
02:02:21,091 --> 02:02:23,051
Look, we can break it apart.
We can sell it.

1395
02:02:23,218 --> 02:02:25,220
-On eBay.
-Everybody get, like, a million apiece.

1396
02:02:25,387 --> 02:02:26,638
I wouldn't do that
if I were you guys.

1397
02:02:26,805 --> 02:02:28,015
-Where you come from?
-From Wakanda.

1398
02:02:28,182 --> 02:02:29,141
What is a Wakanda?

1399
02:02:29,308 --> 02:02:30,142
Hey, yo!

1400
02:02:30,851 --> 02:02:32,060
This yours?

1401
02:02:37,566 --> 02:02:38,734
Who are you?

1402
02:05:24,733 --> 02:05:26,902
My name is King T'Challa...

1403
02:05:27,069 --> 02:05:29,196
son of King T'Chaka.

1404
02:05:29,363 --> 02:05:33,700
I am the sovereign ruler
of the nation of Wakanda.

1405
02:05:33,867 --> 02:05:36,620
And for the first time in our history...

1406
02:05:36,787 --> 02:05:39,998
we will be sharing
our knowledge and resources...

1407
02:05:40,165 --> 02:05:42,042
with the outside world.

1408
02:05:42,209 --> 02:05:45,587
Wakanda will no longer
watch from the shadows.

1409
02:05:45,754 --> 02:05:47,172
We cannot.

1410
02:05:48,298 --> 02:05:49,800
We must not.

1411
02:05:50,133 --> 02:05:52,761
We will work to be an example
of how we...

1412
02:05:52,928 --> 02:05:55,180
as brothers and sisters on this earth...

1413
02:05:55,347 --> 02:05:57,391
should treat each other.

1414
02:05:57,558 --> 02:05:59,393
Now, more than ever...

1415
02:06:00,644 --> 02:06:05,065
the illusions of division
threaten our very existence.

1416
02:06:05,482 --> 02:06:07,401
We all know the truth.

1417
02:06:07,568 --> 02:06:10,988
More connects us than separates us.

1418
02:06:11,154 --> 02:06:12,865
But in times of crisis...

1419
02:06:13,031 --> 02:06:15,492
the wise build bridges...

1420
02:06:15,659 --> 02:06:18,453
while the foolish build barriers.

1421
02:06:18,620 --> 02:06:20,664
We must find a way...

1422
02:06:20,831 --> 02:06:23,458
to look after one another...

1423
02:06:23,625 --> 02:06:28,338
as if we were one, single tribe.

1424
02:06:28,505 --> 02:06:29,965
With all due respect, King T'Challa...

1425
02:06:30,132 --> 02:06:33,343
what can a nation of farmers have
to offer the rest of the world?

1426
02:13:32,930 --> 02:13:34,932
Are you playing around
with that man again?

1427
02:13:35,098 --> 02:13:35,974
-No.
-You're teasing him again.

1428
02:13:37,434 --> 02:13:39,561
-Don't wake him. He must rest.
-No, I'm not.

1429
02:13:40,521 --> 02:13:41,897
No, I'm not.

1430
02:13:42,856 --> 02:13:44,066
Thabo, you're doing that.

1431
02:13:44,233 --> 02:13:45,609
He's doing it. He's lying.

1432
02:13:45,776 --> 02:13:47,194
No, he's resting.

1433
02:13:47,861 --> 02:13:48,695
Go, go!

1434
02:13:48,862 --> 02:13:50,656
White Wolf!

1435
02:13:50,989 --> 02:13:51,865
Stop that!

1436
02:13:51,949 --> 02:13:53,075
White Wolf!

1437
02:13:55,827 --> 02:13:57,454
Good morning, Sergeant Barnes.

1438
02:13:59,081 --> 02:13:59,957
Bucky.

1439
02:14:01,583 --> 02:14:02,626
