1
00:01:10,353 --> 00:01:11,360
Longing.

2
00:01:13,630 --> 00:01:14,630
Rusted.

3
00:01:15,189 --> 00:01:16,189
Seventeen.

4
00:01:16,815 --> 00:01:17,815
Daybreak.

5
00:01:19,025 --> 00:01:20,151
Furnace.

6
00:01:21,534 --> 00:01:22,534
Nine.

7
00:01:23,074 --> 00:01:24,327
Benign.

8
00:01:25,619 --> 00:01:27,370
Homecoming.

9
00:01:28,371 --> 00:01:29,414
One.

10
00:01:31,333 --> 00:01:32,718
Freight car.

11
00:01:40,905 --> 00:01:42,264
Good morning, Soldier.

12
00:01:44,572 --> 00:01:45,947
Ready to comply.

13
00:01:47,213 --> 00:01:48,600
I have a mission for you.

14
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:52,103
Sanction and extract.

15
00:01:52,938 --> 00:01:54,314
No witnesses.

16
00:02:35,563 --> 00:02:37,083
Well done Soldier.

17
00:03:22,009 --> 00:03:23,301
<i>Alright, what do you see?</i>

18
00:03:24,046 --> 00:03:25,509
Standard beat cops.

19
00:03:27,065 --> 00:03:28,338
Small station.

20
00:03:30,702 --> 00:03:31,828
Quiet street.

21
00:03:32,329 --> 00:03:33,830
<i>It's a good target.</i>

22
00:03:34,153 --> 00:03:36,280
There's an ATM on the south corner,
which means?

23
00:03:36,291 --> 00:03:37,334
Cameras.

24
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:39,044
<i>Both cross streets are one-way.</i>

25
00:03:39,336 --> 00:03:41,081
So, compromised escape routes.

26
00:03:41,671 --> 00:03:43,524
Means our guy doesn't
care about being seen.

27
00:03:43,548 --> 00:03:45,534
He isn't afraid to make
a mess on the way out.

28
00:03:45,767 --> 00:03:47,767
You see that Range Rover
halfway up the block?

29
00:03:47,886 --> 00:03:49,916
Yeah, the red one? It's cute.

30
00:03:49,989 --> 00:03:51,285
<i>It's also bulletproof,</i>

31
00:03:51,287 --> 00:03:52,610
<i>which means private security,</i>

32
00:03:52,612 --> 00:03:53,830
<i>which means more guns,</i>

33
00:03:53,832 --> 00:03:56,078
<i>which means more headaches
for somebody, probably us.</i>

34
00:03:56,561 --> 00:03:59,064
You guys know I can move things
with my mind, right?

35
00:03:59,309 --> 00:04:01,523
Looking over your shoulder
needs to become second nature.

36
00:04:02,484 --> 00:04:04,861
Anybody ever tell you
you're a little paranoid?

37
00:04:04,945 --> 00:04:05,973
<i>Not to my face.</i>

38
00:04:05,975 --> 00:04:07,337
<i>Why? Did you hear something?</i>

39
00:04:07,364 --> 00:04:08,614
<i>Eyes on target, folks.</i>

40
00:04:09,012 --> 00:04:10,888
This is the best lead we've had
on Rumlow in six months.

41
00:04:10,902 --> 00:04:12,017
I don't want to lose him.

42
00:04:12,275 --> 00:04:14,213
If he sees us coming,
that won't be a problem.

43
00:04:14,306 --> 00:04:15,640
He kind of hates us.

44
00:04:19,209 --> 00:04:20,081
Sam.

45
00:04:20,194 --> 00:04:21,612
See that garbage truck?

46
00:04:22,045 --> 00:04:23,154
Tag it.

47
00:04:41,846 --> 00:04:42,930
Give me X-ray.

48
00:04:48,071 --> 00:04:49,739
<i>That truck's loaded for max weight.</i>

49
00:04:49,948 --> 00:04:50,948
And the driver's armed.

50
00:04:51,089 --> 00:04:52,302
It's a battering ram.

51
00:04:52,304 --> 00:04:53,305
<i>Go now.</i>
What?

52
00:04:54,452 --> 00:04:55,564
He's not hitting the police.

53
00:05:59,851 --> 00:06:01,770
Body Armour, AR-15s.

54
00:06:01,978 --> 00:06:03,247
<i>I make seven hostiles.</i>

55
00:06:12,322 --> 00:06:13,417
I make five.

56
00:06:19,309 --> 00:06:19,921
Sam.

57
00:06:23,807 --> 00:06:24,561
Four.

58
00:06:29,339 --> 00:06:30,757
Rumlow's on the third floor.

59
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:32,381
Wanda, just like we practiced.

60
00:06:32,383 --> 00:06:33,423
What about the gas?

61
00:06:33,510 --> 00:06:34,475
Get it out.

62
00:06:52,529 --> 00:06:53,571
Pack it up.

63
00:07:31,067 --> 00:07:32,152
He's here.

64
00:07:35,989 --> 00:07:37,407
Rumlow has a biological weapon.

65
00:07:37,574 --> 00:07:38,495
I'm on it.

66
00:08:13,938 --> 00:08:15,773
I don't work like that no more.

67
00:08:19,115 --> 00:08:20,116
Fire in the hole.

68
00:08:25,622 --> 00:08:26,664
No!

69
00:08:49,604 --> 00:08:50,524
Sam.

70
00:08:50,855 --> 00:08:52,713
<i>He's in an AFV heading north.</i>

71
00:08:57,654 --> 00:08:59,156
Take this to the airstrip.

72
00:08:59,518 --> 00:09:01,625
We're not gonna outrun them.
Lose the truck.

73
00:09:09,385 --> 00:09:11,255
Where are you going to meet us?
I'm not.

74
00:09:23,368 --> 00:09:24,891
I've got four, they're splitting up.

75
00:09:29,936 --> 00:09:31,307
I got the two on the left.

76
00:09:40,029 --> 00:09:41,239
They ditched their gear.

77
00:09:41,406 --> 00:09:43,406
It's a shell game now.
One of them has the payload.

78
00:09:49,289 --> 00:09:50,985
There you are,
you son of a bitch.

79
00:09:52,244 --> 00:09:53,671
I've been waiting for this.

80
00:10:10,807 --> 00:10:11,760
He doesn't have it.

81
00:10:12,520 --> 00:10:13,521
I'm empty!

82
00:10:13,730 --> 00:10:14,981
Out of the way!

83
00:10:54,288 --> 00:10:55,224
Drop it.

84
00:10:56,159 --> 00:10:57,159
Or I'll drop this.

85
00:10:58,775 --> 00:11:00,568
Drop it!
He'll do it!

86
00:11:07,867 --> 00:11:08,999
Payload secure.

87
00:11:09,188 --> 00:11:09,974
Thanks, Sam.

88
00:11:09,994 --> 00:11:10,994
Don't thank me.

89
00:11:11,357 --> 00:11:12,905
I'm not thanking that thing.

90
00:11:12,955 --> 00:11:13,956
His name is Redwing.

91
00:11:13,967 --> 00:11:15,351
<i>I'm still not thanking it.</i>

92
00:11:15,476 --> 00:11:16,636
He's cute. Go ahead, pet him.

93
00:11:23,299 --> 00:11:24,300
Come on!

94
00:11:32,603 --> 00:11:34,780
This is for dropping
a building on my face.

95
00:11:56,874 --> 00:11:58,811
I think I look pretty good,
all things considered.

96
00:11:58,835 --> 00:11:59,835
Who's your buyer?

97
00:12:00,211 --> 00:12:01,604
You know, he knew you.

98
00:12:02,171 --> 00:12:04,215
Your pal, your buddy, your BUCKY.

99
00:12:05,888 --> 00:12:06,888
What did you say?

100
00:12:06,890 --> 00:12:08,300
He remembered you.

101
00:12:09,178 --> 00:12:10,161
I was there.

102
00:12:10,515 --> 00:12:11,875
He got all weepy about it.

103
00:12:13,357 --> 00:12:15,150
Till they put his brain back in a blender.

104
00:12:15,935 --> 00:12:17,649
He wanted you to know something.

105
00:12:17,925 --> 00:12:18,968
He said to me.

106
00:12:19,355 --> 00:12:20,799
Please tell Rogers.

107
00:12:22,024 --> 00:12:23,276
When you got to go.

108
00:12:23,787 --> 00:12:24,997
You got to go.

109
00:12:27,530 --> 00:12:29,181
And you're coming with me.

110
00:12:45,631 --> 00:12:46,896
Oh, my God.

111
00:12:50,052 --> 00:12:50,995
Sam.

112
00:12:51,531 --> 00:12:52,344
We need...

113
00:12:53,222 --> 00:12:54,353
Fire and Rescue,

114
00:12:54,677 --> 00:12:56,096
on the south side of the building.

115
00:12:56,696 --> 00:12:57,873
We got to get up there.

116
00:13:05,193 --> 00:13:11,323
♪ <i>Try to remember the kind of September.</i> ♪

117
00:13:11,908 --> 00:13:15,287
♪ <i>When grass was green</i> ♪

118
00:13:16,662 --> 00:13:19,081
Wake up dear,
and say goodbye to your father.

119
00:13:19,310 --> 00:13:21,130
Who's the homeless person
on the couch?

120
00:13:22,335 --> 00:13:24,420
This is why I love coming home
for Christmas,

121
00:13:24,587 --> 00:13:25,838
right before you leave town.

122
00:13:26,005 --> 00:13:28,257
Be nice dear,
he's been studying abroad.

123
00:13:28,424 --> 00:13:30,259
Really? Which broad?
What's her name?

124
00:13:30,426 --> 00:13:31,561
Candice.

125
00:13:32,261 --> 00:13:33,346
Do me a favour?

126
00:13:33,429 --> 00:13:35,273
Try not to burn
the house down before Monday.

127
00:13:35,275 --> 00:13:36,343
Ok, so it's Monday.

128
00:13:36,368 --> 00:13:39,556
That is good to know,
I will plan my toga party accordingly.

129
00:13:40,353 --> 00:13:41,437
Where you going?

130
00:13:41,604 --> 00:13:44,212
Your father's flying us to
the Bahamas for a little getaway.

131
00:13:44,348 --> 00:13:45,915
We might have to make a quick stop.

132
00:13:45,917 --> 00:13:47,570
At the Pentagon. Right?

133
00:13:48,156 --> 00:13:51,316
Don't worry, you're gonna love
the holiday menu at the commissary.

134
00:13:51,318 --> 00:13:53,354
You know they say sarcasm is a metric,

135
00:13:53,641 --> 00:13:56,435
for potential if that's true,
you'll be a great man someday.

136
00:13:56,437 --> 00:13:57,454
I'll get the bags.

137
00:13:59,997 --> 00:14:02,375
He does miss you
when you're not here.

138
00:14:04,126 --> 00:14:05,237
And frankly,

139
00:14:05,816 --> 00:14:07,283
you're going to miss us.

140
00:14:08,393 --> 00:14:11,193
Because this is the last time
we're all going to be together.

141
00:14:12,577 --> 00:14:14,217
You know what's about to happen.

142
00:14:15,434 --> 00:14:16,852
Say something.

143
00:14:16,889 --> 00:14:18,613
If you don't, you'll regret it.

144
00:14:22,645 --> 00:14:23,703
I love you, Dad.

145
00:14:25,314 --> 00:14:26,867
And I know you did
the best you could.

146
00:14:43,416 --> 00:14:44,852
That's how I wish it happened.

147
00:14:47,837 --> 00:14:49,569
Binarily Augmented...

148
00:14:49,571 --> 00:14:51,500
Retro-Framing or BARF.

149
00:14:51,716 --> 00:14:53,331
God, I got to work on that acronym.

150
00:14:53,460 --> 00:14:55,837
An extremely costly method,

151
00:14:56,083 --> 00:14:57,936
of hijacking the hippocampus,

152
00:14:58,537 --> 00:15:00,302
to clear...

153
00:15:01,479 --> 00:15:02,642
traumatic memories.

154
00:15:06,478 --> 00:15:07,688
It doesn't change the fact

155
00:15:07,690 --> 00:15:09,525
that they never made it to the airport...

156
00:15:10,192 --> 00:15:12,816
or all the things I did to
avoid processing my grief,

157
00:15:12,818 --> 00:15:13,518
but...

158
00:15:15,197 --> 00:15:19,535
Plus, $611 million for my
little therapeutic experiment?

159
00:15:21,537 --> 00:15:23,985
No one in their right mind
would have ever funded it.

160
00:15:25,541 --> 00:15:27,841
Help me out,
what's the MIT mission statement?

161
00:15:28,252 --> 00:15:29,803
To generate,

162
00:15:30,127 --> 00:15:32,381
disseminate and preserve knowledge.

163
00:15:32,965 --> 00:15:34,234
And work with others,

164
00:15:34,717 --> 00:15:37,401
to bring it to bear on
the world's great challenges.

165
00:15:38,554 --> 00:15:41,407
Well, you are the others.

166
00:15:42,558 --> 00:15:45,564
And, quiet as it's kept
the challenges facing you,

167
00:15:45,728 --> 00:15:47,248
are the greatest mankind's ever known.

168
00:15:47,657 --> 00:15:49,373
Plus, most of you are broke.

169
00:15:50,187 --> 00:15:51,686
Oh, I'm sorry. Rather, you were.

170
00:15:52,151 --> 00:15:53,402
As of this moment,

171
00:15:53,569 --> 00:15:55,821
every student has been made
an equal recipient,

172
00:15:55,905 --> 00:15:58,787
of the inaugural
September Foundation Grant.

173
00:15:59,225 --> 00:16:00,288
As in...

174
00:16:00,910 --> 00:16:03,400
all of your projects have
just been approved and funded.

175
00:16:06,749 --> 00:16:08,852
No strings, no taxes, just...

176
00:16:09,430 --> 00:16:11,152
reframe the future!

177
00:16:11,837 --> 00:16:13,206
Starting now.

178
00:16:23,653 --> 00:16:24,654
Go break some eggs.

179
00:16:35,444 --> 00:16:37,335
That took my breath away.

180
00:16:37,780 --> 00:16:39,247
Oh, Tony! So generous.

181
00:16:39,435 --> 00:16:40,391
So much money!

182
00:16:41,701 --> 00:16:42,905
Out of curiosity...

183
00:16:43,819 --> 00:16:46,609
will any portion of that grant
be made available to faculty?

184
00:16:46,611 --> 00:16:47,933
I know, gross but hear me out.

185
00:16:47,935 --> 00:16:50,280
I have got this killer idea
for a self-cooking hot dog.

186
00:16:50,282 --> 00:16:52,647
Basically, chemical detonator embedded...
Restroom's this way, yeah?

187
00:16:52,649 --> 00:16:54,052
Yeah. Embedded in the meat shaft.

188
00:16:54,054 --> 00:16:56,231
Mr Stark, I am so sorry
about the teleprompter.

189
00:16:56,232 --> 00:16:57,756
I didn't know Miss Potts had canceled.

190
00:16:57,758 --> 00:16:59,282
They didn't have time to fix it.

191
00:17:01,011 --> 00:17:02,691
It's fine. I'll be right back.

192
00:17:03,305 --> 00:17:04,473
We'll catch up later.

193
00:17:22,658 --> 00:17:24,899
That was nice,
what you did for those young people.

194
00:17:26,327 --> 00:17:27,403
They deserve it.

195
00:17:27,830 --> 00:17:29,672
Plus, it helps ease my conscience.

196
00:17:30,583 --> 00:17:34,754
They say there is a correlation
between generosity and guilt.

197
00:17:36,255 --> 00:17:38,344
But if you've got the money...

198
00:17:39,717 --> 00:17:41,352
break as many eggs as you like.

199
00:17:42,595 --> 00:17:43,334
Right?

200
00:17:52,730 --> 00:17:53,730
Are you going up?

201
00:17:54,190 --> 00:17:55,826
I'm right where I want to be.

202
00:17:56,979 --> 00:17:57,866
Ok. Ok. Hey.

203
00:18:01,363 --> 00:18:03,964
Sorry, it's an occupational hazard.

204
00:18:04,366 --> 00:18:06,010
I work for the State Department.

205
00:18:06,702 --> 00:18:08,231
Human Resources.

206
00:18:08,871 --> 00:18:10,223
I know it's boring...

207
00:18:10,956 --> 00:18:13,696
but it enabled me to raise a son.

208
00:18:15,091 --> 00:18:18,010
I'm very proud
of what he grew up to be.

209
00:18:19,965 --> 00:18:21,965
His name was Charlie Spencer.

210
00:18:24,929 --> 00:18:26,055
You murdered him.

211
00:18:27,723 --> 00:18:29,097
In Sokovia.

212
00:18:31,060 --> 00:18:33,746
Not that matters in the least to you.

213
00:18:35,815 --> 00:18:37,942
You think you fight for us?

214
00:18:39,151 --> 00:18:41,260
You just fight for yourself.

215
00:18:43,033 --> 00:18:46,158
Who's going to avenge my son, Stark?

216
00:18:47,706 --> 00:18:48,813
He's dead,

217
00:18:49,495 --> 00:18:50,880
and I blame you.

218
00:19:00,130 --> 00:19:03,393
<i>11 Wakandans were among
those killed during a confrontation</i>

219
00:19:03,395 --> 00:19:05,621
<i>between the Avengers
and a group of mercenaries</i>

220
00:19:05,665 --> 00:19:07,709
<i>in Lagos, Nigeria last month.</i>

221
00:19:07,778 --> 00:19:09,615
<i>The traditionally reclusive Wakandans</i>

222
00:19:09,617 --> 00:19:11,611
<i>were on an outreach
mission in Lagos,</i>

223
00:19:11,714 --> 00:19:12,802
<i>when the attack occurred.</i>

224
00:19:12,935 --> 00:19:16,105
<i>Our people's blood is spilled
on foreign soil,</i>

225
00:19:16,939 --> 00:19:19,531
<i>not only because of
the actions of criminals,</i>

226
00:19:19,987 --> 00:19:23,624
<i>but by the indifference
of those pledged to stop them.</i>

227
00:19:23,881 --> 00:19:26,491
<i>Victory at the expense of the innocent,</i>

228
00:19:27,283 --> 00:19:29,228
<i>is no victory at all.</i>

229
00:19:29,446 --> 00:19:31,180
<i>The Wakandan king went on...</i>

230
00:19:31,453 --> 00:19:32,973
<i>They are operating outside</i>

231
00:19:32,997 --> 00:19:34,748
<i>and above the international law.</i>

232
00:19:34,832 --> 00:19:36,041
<i>Because that's the reality,</i>

233
00:19:36,125 --> 00:19:37,710
<i>if we don't respond to acts like these.</i>

234
00:19:37,869 --> 00:19:39,763
<i>What legal authority
does an enhanced</i>

235
00:19:39,765 --> 00:19:41,933
<i>individual like
Wanda Maximoff have,</i>

236
00:19:42,002 --> 00:19:43,237
to operate in Nigeri...

237
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:48,971
It's my fault.

238
00:19:49,340 --> 00:19:50,270
That's not true.

239
00:19:50,313 --> 00:19:51,545
Turn the TV back on.

240
00:19:51,724 --> 00:19:53,767
They're being very specific.

241
00:19:53,978 --> 00:19:56,803
I should have clocked that bomb vest
long before you had to deal with it.

242
00:19:58,475 --> 00:19:59,778
Rumlow said BUCKY,

243
00:20:01,614 --> 00:20:04,221
and all of a sudden I was a 16
year old kid again, in Brooklyn.

244
00:20:08,908 --> 00:20:10,292
And people died.

245
00:20:12,895 --> 00:20:13,896
It's on me.

246
00:20:14,330 --> 00:20:15,695
It's on both of us.

247
00:20:17,041 --> 00:20:18,217
This job...

248
00:20:21,412 --> 00:20:23,255
We try to save
as many people as we can.

249
00:20:24,256 --> 00:20:25,925
Sometimes that doesn't
mean everybody.

250
00:20:26,050 --> 00:20:28,010
But if we can't find a way
to live with that...

251
00:20:28,177 --> 00:20:29,395
next time...

252
00:20:31,388 --> 00:20:32,838
maybe nobody gets saved.

253
00:20:37,272 --> 00:20:39,438
Vis! We talked about this.

254
00:20:39,474 --> 00:20:41,697
Yes, but the door was open
so I assumed that...

255
00:20:43,984 --> 00:20:46,764
Captain Rogers wished to know
when Mr Stark was arriving.

256
00:20:47,112 --> 00:20:48,572
Thank you. We'll be right down.

257
00:20:49,114 --> 00:20:51,140
I'll use the door.

258
00:20:52,284 --> 00:20:54,320
Oh, and apparently,
he's brought a guest.

259
00:20:54,653 --> 00:20:55,755
We know who it is?

260
00:20:56,664 --> 00:20:58,020
The Secretary of State.

261
00:21:02,446 --> 00:21:03,465
Five years ago,

262
00:21:03,712 --> 00:21:05,064
I had a heart attack,

263
00:21:05,756 --> 00:21:08,472
and dropped right in
the middle of my backswing.

264
00:21:09,593 --> 00:21:12,177
Turned out it was the best
round of my life because,

265
00:21:12,179 --> 00:21:14,306
after 13 hours of surgery

266
00:21:14,308 --> 00:21:15,701
and a triple bypass...

267
00:21:17,101 --> 00:21:20,854
I found something 40 years
in the Army had never taught me.

268
00:21:21,563 --> 00:21:22,731
Perspective.

269
00:21:24,738 --> 00:21:28,617
The world owes the Avengers
an unpayable debt.

270
00:21:29,655 --> 00:21:30,633
You have...

271
00:21:31,281 --> 00:21:32,575
fought for us,

272
00:21:32,981 --> 00:21:34,333
protected us,

273
00:21:34,656 --> 00:21:35,860
risked your lives,

274
00:21:36,453 --> 00:21:39,765
but while a great many people
see you as heroes,

275
00:21:40,249 --> 00:21:41,609
there are some,

276
00:21:43,627 --> 00:21:45,587
who would prefer the word vigilantes.

277
00:21:45,674 --> 00:21:47,968
What word would you use,
Mr Secretary?

278
00:21:48,306 --> 00:21:49,716
How about dangerous?

279
00:21:50,134 --> 00:21:52,871
What would you call
a group of US-based,

280
00:21:53,006 --> 00:21:55,133
enhanced individuals,

281
00:21:55,339 --> 00:21:58,083
who routinely ignore sovereign borders,

282
00:21:58,232 --> 00:21:59,873
and inflict their will...

283
00:22:00,326 --> 00:22:02,970
wherever they choose
and who frankly,

284
00:22:03,226 --> 00:22:05,707
seem unconcerned
about what they leave behind?

285
00:22:10,494 --> 00:22:11,515
New York.

286
00:22:26,003 --> 00:22:27,455
Washington, D.C.

287
00:22:36,061 --> 00:22:37,479
Sokovia.

288
00:22:48,233 --> 00:22:49,401
Lagos.

289
00:22:58,577 --> 00:23:00,204
Ok. That's enough.

290
00:23:02,414 --> 00:23:03,605
For the past four years,

291
00:23:03,607 --> 00:23:05,183
you've operated with unlimited power,

292
00:23:05,185 --> 00:23:06,590
and no supervision.

293
00:23:06,785 --> 00:23:08,953
That's an arrangement
the governments of the world

294
00:23:09,040 --> 00:23:10,884
can no longer tolerate.

295
00:23:13,534 --> 00:23:15,292
But I think we have a solution.

296
00:23:19,645 --> 00:23:21,451
The Sokovia Accords.

297
00:23:22,601 --> 00:23:25,294
Approved by 117 countries,

298
00:23:25,496 --> 00:23:28,074
it states that the Avengers,

299
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:30,895
shall no longer be
a private organization.

300
00:23:31,119 --> 00:23:32,158
Instead,

301
00:23:32,486 --> 00:23:34,521
they'll operate under the supervision,

302
00:23:34,544 --> 00:23:36,615
of a United Nations panel,

303
00:23:36,909 --> 00:23:39,375
only when and if that panel,

304
00:23:39,800 --> 00:23:41,344
deems it necessary.

305
00:23:42,412 --> 00:23:45,246
The Avengers were formed
to make the world a safer place.

306
00:23:45,791 --> 00:23:47,000
I feel we've done that.

307
00:23:47,541 --> 00:23:51,371
Tell me Captain, do you know
where Thor and Banner are right now?

308
00:23:52,605 --> 00:23:55,065
If I misplaced a couple
of 30 megaton nukes,

309
00:23:55,259 --> 00:23:57,469
you can bet there'd be consequences.

310
00:23:57,970 --> 00:23:59,285
Compromise.

311
00:23:59,574 --> 00:24:00,525
Reassurance.

312
00:24:00,602 --> 00:24:02,206
That's how the world works.

313
00:24:02,432 --> 00:24:03,397
Believe me,

314
00:24:03,774 --> 00:24:05,335
this is the middle ground.

315
00:24:06,481 --> 00:24:09,039
So, there are contingencies.

316
00:24:09,398 --> 00:24:11,879
Three days from now,
the UN meets in Vienna,

317
00:24:11,881 --> 00:24:13,089
to ratify the Accords.

318
00:24:16,405 --> 00:24:17,486
Talk it over.

319
00:24:21,295 --> 00:24:23,828
And if we come
to a decision you don't like?

320
00:24:25,289 --> 00:24:26,874
Then you retire.

321
00:24:50,105 --> 00:24:51,106
Hello?

322
00:24:52,983 --> 00:24:54,543
Is this your car out front?

323
00:24:56,832 --> 00:24:57,995
I jumped the kerb.

324
00:25:00,135 --> 00:25:01,136
Maybe we could,

325
00:25:01,658 --> 00:25:03,100
take care of it ourselves.

326
00:25:03,274 --> 00:25:04,807
If you wanna call the cops, that's...

327
00:25:04,926 --> 00:25:06,597
that's ok too, I guess.
No.

328
00:25:08,665 --> 00:25:09,794
No cops.

329
00:25:11,106 --> 00:25:12,106
Thank you.

330
00:25:49,658 --> 00:25:51,085
You have kept your looks, Colonel.

331
00:25:52,529 --> 00:25:53,530
Congratulations.

332
00:25:57,172 --> 00:25:58,540
Mission report.

333
00:25:58,879 --> 00:26:01,177
December 16, 1991.

334
00:26:01,592 --> 00:26:02,683
Who are you?

335
00:26:04,012 --> 00:26:05,247
My name is Zemo.

336
00:26:07,122 --> 00:26:08,934
I will repeat my question.

337
00:26:09,851 --> 00:26:11,062
Mission report,

338
00:26:11,612 --> 00:26:13,179
December 16,

339
00:26:13,561 --> 00:26:14,733
1991.

340
00:26:15,129 --> 00:26:16,502
How did you find me?

341
00:26:16,623 --> 00:26:18,066
When S.H.I.E.I.D. fell...

342
00:26:19,110 --> 00:26:21,641
Black Widow released
HYDRA files to the public.

343
00:26:22,614 --> 00:26:23,938
Millions of pages.

344
00:26:24,164 --> 00:26:25,365
Much of it encrypted.

345
00:26:25,367 --> 00:26:26,919
Not easy to decipher.

346
00:26:27,301 --> 00:26:28,055
But...

347
00:26:30,627 --> 00:26:31,904
I have experience.

348
00:26:33,166 --> 00:26:34,426
And patience.

349
00:26:36,169 --> 00:26:38,213
A man can do anything if he has those.

350
00:26:39,409 --> 00:26:40,535
What do you want?

351
00:26:41,709 --> 00:26:42,978
Mission report.

352
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:45,404
December 16.

353
00:26:45,824 --> 00:26:47,242
1991.

354
00:26:47,931 --> 00:26:50,751
Go to hell!

355
00:27:05,532 --> 00:27:08,043
HYDRA deserves its place
on the ash heap.

356
00:27:08,493 --> 00:27:10,424
So your death would not bother me.

357
00:27:11,580 --> 00:27:13,540
But I'd have to use this book,

358
00:27:13,889 --> 00:27:17,100
and other bloodier methods
to find what I need.

359
00:27:17,447 --> 00:27:19,183
I don't look forward to that.

360
00:27:21,173 --> 00:27:22,868
You'd only be dying for,

361
00:27:23,550 --> 00:27:24,660
your pride.

362
00:27:39,691 --> 00:27:42,235
Hail HYDRA.

363
00:27:53,661 --> 00:27:56,122
Secretary Ross has
a Congressional Medal of Honor,

364
00:27:56,209 --> 00:27:57,489
which is one more than you have.

365
00:27:57,789 --> 00:27:59,292
So let's say we agree to this thing.

366
00:27:59,423 --> 00:28:01,281
How long is it gonna be
before they LoJack us

367
00:28:01,283 --> 00:28:02,515
like a bunch of common criminals?

368
00:28:02,539 --> 00:28:04,638
117 countries want to sign this.

369
00:28:05,005 --> 00:28:07,552
117 Sam and you're just like,
No, that's cool. We got it.

370
00:28:07,554 --> 00:28:08,762
How long are you going
to play both sides?

371
00:28:08,764 --> 00:28:09,931
I have an equation.

372
00:28:10,607 --> 00:28:11,899
This will clear it up.

373
00:28:12,721 --> 00:28:14,306
In the eight years since Mr Stark

374
00:28:14,308 --> 00:28:15,767
announced himself as Iron Man,

375
00:28:15,769 --> 00:28:19,917
the number of known enhanced
persons has grown exponentially.

376
00:28:20,360 --> 00:28:21,008
And,

377
00:28:21,088 --> 00:28:22,313
during the same period,

378
00:28:22,482 --> 00:28:24,609
the number of potentially
world-ending events

379
00:28:24,611 --> 00:28:26,318
has risen at a commensurate rate.

380
00:28:26,463 --> 00:28:27,714
Are you saying it's our fault?

381
00:28:28,105 --> 00:28:30,366
I'm saying there may be a causality.

382
00:28:32,568 --> 00:28:35,311
Our very strength invites challenge.

383
00:28:35,330 --> 00:28:37,567
Challenge incites conflict.

384
00:28:38,125 --> 00:28:39,166
And conflict,

385
00:28:41,461 --> 00:28:42,931
breeds catastrophe.

386
00:28:44,011 --> 00:28:45,224
Oversight.

387
00:28:47,676 --> 00:28:50,595
Oversight is not an idea that
can be dismissed out of hand.

388
00:28:50,846 --> 00:28:51,703
Boom.

389
00:28:52,339 --> 00:28:53,271
Tony.

390
00:28:53,942 --> 00:28:56,745
You are being uncharacteristically
non-hyperverbal.

391
00:28:56,830 --> 00:28:58,183
It's because he's already
made up his mind.

392
00:28:58,270 --> 00:28:59,447
Boy, you know me so well.

393
00:29:01,148 --> 00:29:03,650
Actually, I'm nursing
an electromagnetic headache.

394
00:29:04,526 --> 00:29:06,914
That's what's going on, Cap.
It's just pain.

395
00:29:08,650 --> 00:29:09,839
It's discomfort.

396
00:29:10,073 --> 00:29:12,293
Who's putting coffee grounds
in the disposal?

397
00:29:12,909 --> 00:29:15,144
Am I running a bed and breakfast
for a biker gang?

398
00:29:21,871 --> 00:29:23,596
Oh, that's Charles Spencer,
by the way.

399
00:29:24,311 --> 00:29:25,209
He's a great kid.

400
00:29:25,264 --> 00:29:28,467
Computer engineering degree, 3.6 GPA,

401
00:29:28,675 --> 00:29:31,328
had a floor-level gig
at Intel planned for the fall.

402
00:29:31,470 --> 00:29:33,999
But first, he wanted to put
a few miles on his soul,

403
00:29:34,181 --> 00:29:36,683
before he parked it
behind a desk. See the world.

404
00:29:36,712 --> 00:29:37,817
Maybe be of service.

405
00:29:39,275 --> 00:29:40,475
Charlie didn't
want to go to Vegas

406
00:29:40,477 --> 00:29:42,124
or Fort Lauderdale,
which is what I would do.

407
00:29:42,147 --> 00:29:44,858
He didn't go to Paris or Amsterdam,
which sounds fun.

408
00:29:45,190 --> 00:29:46,914
He decided to spend his summer,

409
00:29:47,068 --> 00:29:48,749
building sustainable housing
for the poor.

410
00:29:48,751 --> 00:29:50,253
Guess where. Sokovia.

411
00:29:54,239 --> 00:29:55,666
He wanted to make a difference,
I suppose.

412
00:29:55,668 --> 00:29:56,910
I mean we won't know because we dropped

413
00:29:56,912 --> 00:29:59,039
a building on him
while we were kicking ass.

414
00:30:07,422 --> 00:30:09,137
There's no decision-making
process here.

415
00:30:11,705 --> 00:30:12,935
We need to be put in check!

416
00:30:13,344 --> 00:30:15,100
Whatever form that takes, I'm game.

417
00:30:15,639 --> 00:30:17,807
If we can't accept limitations,
if we're boundary-less,

418
00:30:17,809 --> 00:30:19,936
we're no better than the bad guys.

419
00:30:20,101 --> 00:30:22,804
Tony, someone dies on your watch,
you don't give up.

420
00:30:22,806 --> 00:30:23,676
Who said we're giving up?

421
00:30:23,678 --> 00:30:26,264
We are if we're not
taking responsibility for our actions.

422
00:30:26,399 --> 00:30:28,076
This document just shifts the blame.

423
00:30:28,078 --> 00:30:29,446
I'm sorry, Steve that...

424
00:30:30,268 --> 00:30:31,901
that is dangerously arrogant.

425
00:30:31,979 --> 00:30:34,159
This is the United Nations
we're talking about.

426
00:30:34,180 --> 00:30:36,533
It's not the World Security Council,

427
00:30:36,535 --> 00:30:37,929
it's not S.H.I.E.I.D., it's not HYDRA.

428
00:30:37,931 --> 00:30:39,327
No, but it's run by people

429
00:30:39,329 --> 00:30:40,705
with agendas, and agendas change.

430
00:30:40,754 --> 00:30:42,648
That's good. That's why I'm here.

431
00:30:42,650 --> 00:30:45,400
When I realised what my weapons
were capable of in the wrong hands,

432
00:30:45,650 --> 00:30:47,260
I shut it down
and stopped manufacturing.

433
00:30:47,262 --> 00:30:49,548
Tony, you chose to do that.

434
00:30:49,631 --> 00:30:52,211
If we sign this, we surrender
our right to choose.

435
00:30:53,552 --> 00:30:56,030
What if this panel sends us somewhere
we don't think we should go?

436
00:30:56,054 --> 00:30:57,470
What if there is somewhere
we need to go

437
00:30:57,472 --> 00:30:58,473
and they don't let us?

438
00:30:58,904 --> 00:31:00,225
We may not be perfect but,

439
00:31:00,426 --> 00:31:02,054
the safest hands are still our own.

440
00:31:02,185 --> 00:31:04,350
If we don't do this now,

441
00:31:04,688 --> 00:31:06,110
it's gonna be done to us later.

442
00:31:06,523 --> 00:31:08,336
That's the fact. That won't be pretty.

443
00:31:08,357 --> 00:31:09,584
You're saying they'll come for me.

444
00:31:09,859 --> 00:31:11,090
We would protect you.

445
00:31:11,319 --> 00:31:12,480
Maybe Tony's right.

446
00:31:14,293 --> 00:31:17,909
If we have one hand on the wheel,
we can still steer.

447
00:31:18,255 --> 00:31:20,041
If we take it off...
Aren't you the same woman

448
00:31:20,043 --> 00:31:22,389
who told the government
to kiss her ass a few years ago?

449
00:31:22,391 --> 00:31:23,184
I'm just...

450
00:31:23,762 --> 00:31:24,933
reading the terrain.

451
00:31:25,041 --> 00:31:26,268
We have made,

452
00:31:26,644 --> 00:31:28,313
some very public mistakes.

453
00:31:28,651 --> 00:31:30,239
We need to win their trust back.

454
00:31:30,241 --> 00:31:31,317
Focus up. I'm sorry.

455
00:31:31,319 --> 00:31:33,657
Did I just mishear you,
or did you agree with me?

456
00:31:33,881 --> 00:31:34,986
I want to take it back now.

457
00:31:35,010 --> 00:31:36,010
No, no you can't retract it.

458
00:31:36,094 --> 00:31:37,978
Thank you. Unprecedented.

459
00:31:38,956 --> 00:31:41,347
Ok. Case closed. I win.

460
00:31:42,851 --> 00:31:43,984
I have to go.

461
00:32:26,227 --> 00:32:29,885
And now, I would like
to invite Sharon Carter

462
00:32:30,238 --> 00:32:31,823
to come up and say a few words.

463
00:32:45,121 --> 00:32:48,211
Margaret Carter was known to most
as a founder of S.H.I.E.I.D,

464
00:32:49,292 --> 00:32:51,378
but I just knew her as Aunt Peggy.

465
00:32:53,755 --> 00:32:55,746
She had a photograph in her office.

466
00:32:55,882 --> 00:32:58,511
Aunt Peggy standing next to JFK.

467
00:33:00,128 --> 00:33:01,596
As a kid, that was pretty cool.

468
00:33:01,888 --> 00:33:03,848
But it was a lot to live up to.

469
00:33:04,379 --> 00:33:06,768
Which is why I never told
anyone we were related.

470
00:33:08,186 --> 00:33:10,364
I asked her once how she managed

471
00:33:10,397 --> 00:33:13,540
to master diplomacy and espionage,
in a time when,

472
00:33:13,920 --> 00:33:16,415
no one wanted to see
a woman succeed at either.

473
00:33:17,352 --> 00:33:19,210
She said compromise where you can.

474
00:33:20,150 --> 00:33:21,250
But where you can't,

475
00:33:22,057 --> 00:33:22,861
don't.

476
00:33:24,160 --> 00:33:25,310
Even if everyone,

477
00:33:25,711 --> 00:33:27,903
is telling you that something wrong,

478
00:33:28,317 --> 00:33:29,412
is something right.

479
00:33:29,993 --> 00:33:32,775
Even if the whole world
is telling you to move,

480
00:33:33,306 --> 00:33:34,585
it is your duty,

481
00:33:35,350 --> 00:33:36,882
to plant yourself like a tree,

482
00:33:37,267 --> 00:33:39,089
look them in the eye and say no,

483
00:33:40,059 --> 00:33:41,010
you move.

484
00:33:53,273 --> 00:33:54,693
When I came out of the ice,

485
00:33:55,483 --> 00:33:57,263
I thought everyone
I had known was gone.

486
00:33:58,611 --> 00:34:00,314
Then I found out she was alive.

487
00:34:01,781 --> 00:34:03,324
I was just lucky to have her.

488
00:34:03,950 --> 00:34:05,375
She had you back, too.

489
00:34:07,871 --> 00:34:09,205
Who else signed?

490
00:34:10,081 --> 00:34:12,876
Tony, Rhodey, Vision.

491
00:34:13,793 --> 00:34:14,794
Clint?

492
00:34:15,775 --> 00:34:16,956
Says he's retired.

493
00:34:17,238 --> 00:34:19,174
Wanda?
TBD.

494
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:23,511
I'm off to Vienna
for the signing of the Accords.

495
00:34:23,762 --> 00:34:25,305
There's plenty of room on the jet.

496
00:34:29,184 --> 00:34:32,020
Just because it's the path
of least resistance,

497
00:34:32,022 --> 00:34:33,963
doesn't mean it's the wrong path.

498
00:34:34,412 --> 00:34:37,005
Staying together is more important
than how we stay together.

499
00:34:38,318 --> 00:34:39,879
What are we giving up to do it?

500
00:34:44,657 --> 00:34:45,810
I'm sorry, Nat.

501
00:34:46,455 --> 00:34:47,654
I can't sign it.

502
00:34:49,245 --> 00:34:50,078
I know.

503
00:34:52,665 --> 00:34:54,083
Then what are you doing here?

504
00:34:56,920 --> 00:34:58,690
I didn't want you to be alone.

505
00:35:05,970 --> 00:35:07,180
Come here.

506
00:35:12,727 --> 00:35:15,011
At a special United Nations conference,

507
00:35:15,730 --> 00:35:18,274
117 countries have come together

508
00:35:18,276 --> 00:35:20,522
to ratify the Sokovia Accords.

509
00:35:25,096 --> 00:35:26,556
Excuse me, Ms Romanoff?

510
00:35:26,616 --> 00:35:28,336
Yes?
These need your signature.

511
00:35:29,911 --> 00:35:31,246
Thank you.
Thanks.

512
00:35:32,372 --> 00:35:35,270
I suppose neither of us
is used to the spotlight.

513
00:35:36,126 --> 00:35:36,740
Well,

514
00:35:37,232 --> 00:35:39,083
it's not always so flattering.

515
00:35:39,266 --> 00:35:41,401
You seem to be doing alright so far.

516
00:35:42,252 --> 00:35:44,382
Considering your last trip
to Capitol Hill,

517
00:35:44,676 --> 00:35:47,790
I would not think you'd be particularly
comfortable in this company.

518
00:35:48,185 --> 00:35:49,118
Well, I'm not.

519
00:35:49,472 --> 00:35:52,143
And that alone makes me glad
you are here, Ms Romanoff.

520
00:35:52,556 --> 00:35:54,220
Why? You don't approve of all this?

521
00:35:54,222 --> 00:35:55,511
The Accords, yes.

522
00:35:55,978 --> 00:35:57,713
The politics, not really.

523
00:35:58,189 --> 00:36:01,655
Two people in a room can get
more done than a hundred.

524
00:36:01,823 --> 00:36:04,159
Unless you need to move a piano.

525
00:36:04,576 --> 00:36:05,843
Father.
Son.

526
00:36:06,578 --> 00:36:07,621
Ms Romanoff.

527
00:36:07,639 --> 00:36:08,622
King T'Chaka.

528
00:36:08,624 --> 00:36:11,495
Please, allow me to apologise
for what happened in Nigeria.

529
00:36:12,097 --> 00:36:12,987
Thank you.

530
00:36:13,765 --> 00:36:15,874
Thank you for agreeing to all of this.

531
00:36:16,165 --> 00:36:19,294
I'm sad to hear that Captain Rogers
will not be joining us today.

532
00:36:20,056 --> 00:36:20,802
Yes, so am I.

533
00:36:20,804 --> 00:36:22,364
<i>If everyone could please be seated.</i>

534
00:36:22,541 --> 00:36:24,192
<i>This assembly is now in session.</i>

535
00:36:25,258 --> 00:36:26,553
That is the future calling.

536
00:36:28,136 --> 00:36:29,262
Such a pleasure.

537
00:36:29,470 --> 00:36:30,638
Thank you.

538
00:36:31,973 --> 00:36:33,618
For a man

539
00:36:33,792 --> 00:36:35,801
who disapproves of diplomacy,

540
00:36:36,257 --> 00:36:38,092
you're getting quite good at it.

541
00:36:38,764 --> 00:36:40,148
I'm happy, Father.

542
00:36:45,368 --> 00:36:46,213
Thank you.

543
00:36:47,196 --> 00:36:48,012
Thank you.

544
00:36:48,931 --> 00:36:51,326
When stolen Wakandan vibranium

545
00:36:51,616 --> 00:36:53,931
was used to make a terrible weapon,

546
00:36:54,412 --> 00:36:58,144
we in Wakanda were forced
to question our legacy.

547
00:36:58,986 --> 00:37:01,304
Those men and women killed in Nigeria,

548
00:37:01,374 --> 00:37:04,126
were part of a goodwill mission
from a country

549
00:37:04,248 --> 00:37:05,923
too long in the shadows.

550
00:37:06,799 --> 00:37:08,417
We will not however,

551
00:37:08,690 --> 00:37:10,834
let misfortune drive us back.

552
00:37:11,095 --> 00:37:14,473
We will fight to improve
the world we wish to join.

553
00:37:15,259 --> 00:37:17,091
I am grateful to the Avengers,

554
00:37:17,481 --> 00:37:19,139
for supporting this initiative.

555
00:37:21,051 --> 00:37:23,241
Wakanda is proud

556
00:37:23,467 --> 00:37:25,483
to extend its hand in peace.

557
00:37:25,485 --> 00:37:26,633
Everybody get down!

558
00:38:01,574 --> 00:38:04,215
My mom tried to talk me out
of enlisting but...

559
00:38:04,416 --> 00:38:05,560
not Aunt Peggy.

560
00:38:05,961 --> 00:38:07,878
She bought me my first thigh holster.

561
00:38:08,486 --> 00:38:09,550
Very practical.

562
00:38:10,277 --> 00:38:11,381
And stylish.

563
00:38:17,495 --> 00:38:19,747
CIA has you stationed over here now?

564
00:38:19,819 --> 00:38:20,708
Berlin.

565
00:38:20,822 --> 00:38:22,135
Joint Terrorism Task Force.

566
00:38:22,137 --> 00:38:22,625
Right.

567
00:38:23,237 --> 00:38:24,365
Right. Sounds fun.

568
00:38:24,585 --> 00:38:25,459
I know, right?

569
00:38:28,756 --> 00:38:30,131
I've been meaning to ask you.

570
00:38:31,172 --> 00:38:34,154
When you were spying on me
from across the hall,

571
00:38:34,156 --> 00:38:35,712
You mean when I was doing my job.

572
00:38:38,641 --> 00:38:39,851
Did Peggy know?

573
00:38:42,351 --> 00:38:43,888
She kept so many secrets.

574
00:38:45,168 --> 00:38:46,794
I didn't want her to have one from you.

575
00:38:51,154 --> 00:38:52,371
Thanks for walking me back.

576
00:38:52,890 --> 00:38:53,819
Sure.

577
00:38:57,342 --> 00:38:58,272
Steve.

578
00:38:58,994 --> 00:39:00,428
There's something you got to see.

579
00:39:01,080 --> 00:39:02,730
<i>A bomb hidden in a news van,</i>

580
00:39:02,886 --> 00:39:05,031
Who's coordinating?
<i>Ripped through the UN building in Vienna.</i>

581
00:39:05,126 --> 00:39:07,296
Good. They're solid. Forensics?
<i>More than 70 people have been injured.</i>

582
00:39:07,329 --> 00:39:10,671
<i>At least 12 are dead,
including Wakanda's King T'Chaka.</i>

583
00:39:11,205 --> 00:39:13,217
<i>Officials have released
a video of a suspect,</i>

584
00:39:13,384 --> 00:39:15,803
<i>who they have identified
as James Buchanan Barnes,</i>

585
00:39:15,970 --> 00:39:17,388
<i>the Winter Soldier.</i>

586
00:39:17,390 --> 00:39:18,849
<i>The infamous HYDRA agent,</i>

587
00:39:18,851 --> 00:39:21,902
<i>linked to numerous acts of terrorism
and political assassinations.</i>

588
00:39:22,240 --> 00:39:23,657
I have to go to work.

589
00:39:29,567 --> 00:39:32,630
Call MI6, see if we can get
Micro Forensics to hurry this up.

590
00:39:32,945 --> 00:39:35,223
We need the whole team here
in two hours or it's not worth it.

591
00:39:45,583 --> 00:39:46,751
I'm very sorry.

592
00:39:53,758 --> 00:39:55,001
In my culture,

593
00:39:55,343 --> 00:39:56,256
death,

594
00:39:56,984 --> 00:39:58,343
is not the end.

595
00:40:00,014 --> 00:40:01,369
It's more of a...

596
00:40:01,777 --> 00:40:03,148
stepping-off point.

597
00:40:04,391 --> 00:40:06,581
You reach out with both hands,
and Bast

598
00:40:06,809 --> 00:40:07,857
and Sekhmet,

599
00:40:08,090 --> 00:40:10,239
they lead you into the green veldt,

600
00:40:11,859 --> 00:40:13,332
where you can run forever.

601
00:40:15,036 --> 00:40:16,704
That sounds very peaceful.

602
00:40:17,949 --> 00:40:19,670
My father thought so.

603
00:40:21,695 --> 00:40:23,580
I am not my father.

604
00:40:24,296 --> 00:40:25,320
T'Challa,

605
00:40:26,083 --> 00:40:28,620
Task Force will decide
who brings in Barnes.

606
00:40:30,628 --> 00:40:32,517
Don't bother, Ms Romanoff.

607
00:40:33,908 --> 00:40:35,493
I'll kill him myself.

608
00:40:42,210 --> 00:40:42,974
Yeah?

609
00:40:42,976 --> 00:40:44,003
You alright?

610
00:40:44,183 --> 00:40:46,932
<i>Yeah, thanks. I got lucky.</i>

611
00:40:53,067 --> 00:40:56,538
I know how much Barnes
means to you. I really do.

612
00:40:57,655 --> 00:40:58,741
Stay home.

613
00:40:59,750 --> 00:41:01,083
You'll only make this worse.

614
00:41:01,253 --> 00:41:02,388
<i>For all of us.</i>

615
00:41:02,590 --> 00:41:03,633
<i>Please.</i>

616
00:41:03,679 --> 00:41:04,864
Are you saying you'll arrest me?

617
00:41:04,912 --> 00:41:05,778
No.

618
00:41:07,538 --> 00:41:08,581
Someone will.

619
00:41:08,583 --> 00:41:10,549
<i>If you interfere.
That's how it works now.</i>

620
00:41:11,002 --> 00:41:12,477
If he's this far gone Nat,

621
00:41:12,832 --> 00:41:14,292
I should be the one to bring him in.

622
00:41:14,294 --> 00:41:15,127
<i>Why?</i>

623
00:41:15,334 --> 00:41:17,253
Because I'm the one
least likely to die trying.

624
00:41:20,011 --> 00:41:21,011
Shit.

625
00:41:25,433 --> 00:41:26,850
She tell you to stay out of it?

626
00:41:29,020 --> 00:41:30,021
Might have a point.

627
00:41:30,188 --> 00:41:31,314
He'd do it for me.

628
00:41:31,564 --> 00:41:32,982
1945, maybe.

629
00:41:33,107 --> 00:41:35,341
I just want to make sure
we consider all our options.

630
00:41:36,152 --> 00:41:37,528
The people that shoot at you

631
00:41:37,619 --> 00:41:39,195
usually wind up shooting at me.

632
00:41:41,699 --> 00:41:44,285
Tips have been pouring in
since that footage went public.

633
00:41:44,493 --> 00:41:46,813
Everybody thinks
the Winter Soldier goes to their gym.

634
00:41:47,154 --> 00:41:48,424
Most of it's noise.

635
00:41:48,658 --> 00:41:49,957
Except for this.

636
00:41:51,779 --> 00:41:54,281
My boss expects a briefing,
pretty much now,

637
00:41:54,283 --> 00:41:56,085
so that's all the head start
you're gonna get.

638
00:41:56,714 --> 00:41:57,714
Thank you.

639
00:41:57,716 --> 00:41:58,989
You're gonna have to hurry.

640
00:42:00,103 --> 00:42:01,802
We have orders to shoot on sight.

641
00:42:04,722 --> 00:42:05,367
Come...

642
00:42:05,794 --> 00:42:06,793
Comeback.

643
00:42:07,529 --> 00:42:08,475
At home.

644
00:42:08,554 --> 00:42:09,706
Comeback.

645
00:42:10,511 --> 00:42:11,324
At home.

646
00:42:12,923 --> 00:42:13,759
One.

647
00:42:14,500 --> 00:42:15,281
One.

648
00:42:16,302 --> 00:42:17,404
Freight...

649
00:42:17,827 --> 00:42:18,598
car.

650
00:42:20,336 --> 00:42:21,363
Freight car.

651
00:42:23,012 --> 00:42:23,613
Frei...

652
00:42:32,601 --> 00:42:33,396
Mr. Müller.

653
00:42:33,898 --> 00:42:35,153
I have your breakfast.

654
00:42:39,610 --> 00:42:41,012
I could smell it
before I opened the door.

655
00:42:41,013 --> 00:42:41,923
Thank you.

656
00:42:41,924 --> 00:42:44,042
Bacon and black coffee.

657
00:42:44,053 --> 00:42:44,760
Again.

658
00:42:44,876 --> 00:42:46,970
I can make you something
different, if you like.

659
00:42:46,972 --> 00:42:47,974
It's ok. This is wonderful,

660
00:42:48,142 --> 00:42:49,292
I will just put this on your...
No. No.

661
00:42:49,294 --> 00:42:50,890
It's ok. It's ok, I can do it.

662
00:42:51,659 --> 00:42:53,312
Thank you Ms. Leiber.

663
00:43:01,627 --> 00:43:03,426
How much, they are ripe?

664
00:43:03,428 --> 00:43:04,632
They are ripe, season fruit.

665
00:43:06,955 --> 00:43:09,387
I will take... This ones.

666
00:43:10,528 --> 00:43:12,035
Thank you.
Thank you.

667
00:44:24,779 --> 00:44:25,851
<i>Heads up, Cap.</i>

668
00:44:25,946 --> 00:44:28,064
<i>German Special Forces,
approaching from the south.</i>

669
00:44:29,075 --> 00:44:30,044
Understood.

670
00:44:39,043 --> 00:44:40,043
Do you know me?

671
00:44:42,922 --> 00:44:44,212
You're Steve.

672
00:44:45,466 --> 00:44:47,097
I read about you in a museum.

673
00:44:47,887 --> 00:44:48,939
<i>They've set the perimeter.</i>

674
00:44:51,097 --> 00:44:52,289
I know you're nervous,

675
00:44:53,082 --> 00:44:54,540
and you have plenty of reason to be.

676
00:44:56,111 --> 00:44:57,237
But you're lying.

677
00:44:58,836 --> 00:45:00,938
I wasn't in Vienna.
I don't do that any more.

678
00:45:00,940 --> 00:45:02,140
<i>They're entering the building.</i>

679
00:45:02,191 --> 00:45:04,526
Well, the people who think
you did are coming here now.

680
00:45:05,026 --> 00:45:06,671
And they're not planning
on taking you alive.

681
00:45:06,821 --> 00:45:07,820
That's smart.

682
00:45:08,546 --> 00:45:09,755
Good strategy.

683
00:45:11,048 --> 00:45:12,816
<i>They're on the roof.
I'm compromised.</i>

684
00:45:15,871 --> 00:45:17,651
This doesn't have to end in a fight, Buck.

685
00:45:23,099 --> 00:45:24,966
It always ends in a fight.
<i>Five seconds.</i>

686
00:45:25,673 --> 00:45:27,284
You pulled me from the river.

687
00:45:27,850 --> 00:45:28,850
Why?

688
00:45:29,930 --> 00:45:31,515
I don't know.
<i>Three seconds.</i>

689
00:45:31,814 --> 00:45:32,797
Yes, you do.

690
00:45:34,596 --> 00:45:35,870
Breach! Breach! Breach!

691
00:45:39,886 --> 00:45:41,027
Smash the door!

692
00:45:56,328 --> 00:45:57,328
Buck, stop!

693
00:45:58,111 --> 00:45:59,195
You're gonna kill someone.

694
00:46:02,109 --> 00:46:03,444
I'm not gonna kill anyone.

695
00:46:49,423 --> 00:46:50,679
Suspect has broken containment!

696
00:46:50,752 --> 00:46:52,400
He's headed down the east stairwell!

697
00:47:03,968 --> 00:47:04,968
Come on, man.

698
00:48:09,587 --> 00:48:10,823
Sam, southwest rooftop.

699
00:48:11,045 --> 00:48:12,198
<i>Who the hell's the other guy?</i>

700
00:48:12,391 --> 00:48:13,642
About to find out.

701
00:48:26,478 --> 00:48:27,746
Sam.
<i>Got him.</i>

702
00:49:09,897 --> 00:49:11,273
Stand down!

703
00:49:13,901 --> 00:49:14,902
Stand down!

704
00:49:43,931 --> 00:49:45,432
Sam, I can't shake this guy.

705
00:49:45,514 --> 00:49:46,767
Right behind you.

706
00:51:21,862 --> 00:51:23,906
Stand down, now.

707
00:51:31,038 --> 00:51:32,457
Congratulations, Cap.

708
00:51:33,040 --> 00:51:34,471
You're a criminal.

709
00:51:57,397 --> 00:51:58,607
Your Highness.

710
00:52:04,822 --> 00:52:06,375
A pinch of paprika.

711
00:52:07,157 --> 00:52:08,158
A pinch.

712
00:52:11,954 --> 00:52:13,368
Is that paprikash?

713
00:52:13,956 --> 00:52:17,408
I thought it might lift your spirits.

714
00:52:30,764 --> 00:52:32,620
Spirits lifted.

715
00:52:34,351 --> 00:52:35,870
In my defense I...

716
00:52:35,990 --> 00:52:37,213
I haven't actually ever...

717
00:52:38,156 --> 00:52:40,085
eaten anything before so...
May I?

718
00:52:40,607 --> 00:52:41,607
Please.

719
00:52:48,394 --> 00:52:49,394
Wanda?

720
00:52:50,450 --> 00:52:52,077
No one dislikes you, Wanda.

721
00:52:54,538 --> 00:52:55,440
Thanks.

722
00:52:55,566 --> 00:52:56,763
Oh, you're welcome, no...

723
00:52:56,874 --> 00:53:00,210
it's a involuntary response
in their amygdala.

724
00:53:00,212 --> 00:53:02,061
They can't help but be afraid of you.

725
00:53:02,306 --> 00:53:03,306
Are you?

726
00:53:03,630 --> 00:53:05,424
My amygdala is synthetic so...

727
00:53:08,948 --> 00:53:11,618
I used to think of myself one way.

728
00:53:11,949 --> 00:53:12,797
But...

729
00:53:13,974 --> 00:53:15,293
after this...

730
00:53:16,310 --> 00:53:18,190
I am something else.

731
00:53:18,472 --> 00:53:19,745
I'm still...

732
00:53:19,934 --> 00:53:21,073
me I think,

733
00:53:21,504 --> 00:53:22,248
but...

734
00:53:24,486 --> 00:53:26,735
that's not what everyone else sees.

735
00:53:29,995 --> 00:53:31,556
Do you know,
I don't know what this is?

736
00:53:33,160 --> 00:53:34,161
Not really.

737
00:53:34,801 --> 00:53:36,354
I know it's not of this world,

738
00:53:36,442 --> 00:53:39,534
that it powered Loki's staff
gave you your abilities but...

739
00:53:41,793 --> 00:53:45,005
its true nature is a mystery.

740
00:53:45,297 --> 00:53:46,967
And yet it is part of me.

741
00:53:47,467 --> 00:53:48,693
Are you afraid of it?

742
00:53:49,343 --> 00:53:50,998
I wish to understand it.

743
00:53:51,845 --> 00:53:53,733
The more I do,
the less it controls me.

744
00:53:54,016 --> 00:53:54,862
One day,

745
00:53:55,918 --> 00:53:56,936
who knows?

746
00:53:57,126 --> 00:53:58,536
I may even control it.

747
00:54:01,229 --> 00:54:03,068
I don't know what's in this but,

748
00:54:03,233 --> 00:54:05,308
it is not paprika.

749
00:54:05,976 --> 00:54:08,062
I'm gonna go to the store.

750
00:54:08,570 --> 00:54:10,572
I'll be back in 20 minutes.

751
00:54:10,781 --> 00:54:13,867
Alternatively,
we could order a pizza?

752
00:54:15,090 --> 00:54:17,968
Vision, are you not letting me leave?

753
00:54:20,140 --> 00:54:21,375
It is a question of safety.

754
00:54:21,689 --> 00:54:23,608
I can protect myself.

755
00:54:24,878 --> 00:54:26,005
Not yours.

756
00:54:27,923 --> 00:54:30,550
Mr Stark would like
to avoid the possibility

757
00:54:30,717 --> 00:54:32,331
of another public incident.

758
00:54:32,886 --> 00:54:34,409
Until the Accords are on a...

759
00:54:34,910 --> 00:54:36,723
more secure foundation.

760
00:54:39,518 --> 00:54:41,059
And what do you want?

761
00:54:42,688 --> 00:54:44,189
For people to see you,

762
00:54:45,065 --> 00:54:46,173
as I do.

763
00:55:19,725 --> 00:55:20,799
So, you like cats?

764
00:55:20,892 --> 00:55:22,561
Sam.
What?

765
00:55:22,853 --> 00:55:25,313
Dude shows up dressed like a cat,
you don't wanna know more?

766
00:55:27,524 --> 00:55:29,425
Your suit, it's vibranium?

767
00:55:32,946 --> 00:55:34,957
The Black Panther
has been the protector

768
00:55:34,981 --> 00:55:36,756
of Wakanda for generations.

769
00:55:38,243 --> 00:55:41,380
A mantle, passed from warrior to warrior.

770
00:55:43,081 --> 00:55:45,834
And now, because your friend
murdered my father,

771
00:55:46,958 --> 00:55:49,010
I also wear the mantle of king.

772
00:55:50,130 --> 00:55:51,372
So I ask you,

773
00:55:51,673 --> 00:55:54,184
as both warrior and king,

774
00:55:55,886 --> 00:55:59,297
how long do you think you can
keep your friend safe from me?

775
00:56:19,451 --> 00:56:20,744
What's gonna happen to him?

776
00:56:20,911 --> 00:56:22,428
Same thing that ought
to happen to you.

777
00:56:22,916 --> 00:56:25,126
Psychological evaluation
and extradition.

778
00:56:25,527 --> 00:56:28,080
This is Everett Ross,
Deputy Task Force Commander.

779
00:56:28,166 --> 00:56:29,167
What about a lawyer?

780
00:56:29,341 --> 00:56:30,581
Lawyer. That's funny.

781
00:56:31,061 --> 00:56:32,728
See their weapons
are placed in lockup.

782
00:56:33,298 --> 00:56:34,839
We'll write you a receipt.

783
00:56:35,342 --> 00:56:38,536
I better not look out the window
and see anybody flying around in that.

784
00:56:44,726 --> 00:56:47,771
You'll be provided with an office,
instead of a cell.

785
00:56:47,854 --> 00:56:49,603
Now do me a favour, stay in it?

786
00:56:50,524 --> 00:56:52,484
I don't intend on going anywhere.

787
00:56:52,651 --> 00:56:56,279
For the record, this is what
making things worse looks like.

788
00:56:56,617 --> 00:56:57,743
He's alive.

789
00:56:57,745 --> 00:56:58,496
No.

790
00:56:59,825 --> 00:57:01,692
Romania was not Accords-sanctioned.

791
00:57:02,115 --> 00:57:03,742
Colonel Rhodes is supervising cleanup.

792
00:57:03,995 --> 00:57:05,584
Try not to break anything
while we fix this.

793
00:57:05,586 --> 00:57:07,436
Consequences?
You bet there'll be consequences.

794
00:57:08,706 --> 00:57:10,333
Obviously you can quote me on that,

795
00:57:10,335 --> 00:57:11,854
because I just said it. Anything else?

796
00:57:12,190 --> 00:57:13,233
Thank you, sir.

797
00:57:14,172 --> 00:57:15,465
Consequences?

798
00:57:15,582 --> 00:57:17,280
Secretary Ross
wants you both prosecuted.

799
00:57:17,405 --> 00:57:18,550
Had to give him something.

800
00:57:18,552 --> 00:57:20,112
I'm not getting that shield back, am I?

801
00:57:20,470 --> 00:57:21,990
Technically, it's the government's property.

802
00:57:22,302 --> 00:57:23,123
Wings, too.

803
00:57:23,248 --> 00:57:24,196
That's cold.

804
00:57:24,227 --> 00:57:25,616
Warmer than jail.

805
00:57:53,545 --> 00:57:55,088
Hey, you wanna see something cool?

806
00:57:56,423 --> 00:57:58,292
I pulled something from Dad's archives.

807
00:58:00,051 --> 00:58:01,328
Felt timely.

808
00:58:05,578 --> 00:58:08,690
FDR signed the Lend-Lease bill
with these in 1941.

809
00:58:09,686 --> 00:58:12,343
Provided support to the Allies
when they needed it most.

810
00:58:12,772 --> 00:58:14,812
Some would say it brought
our country closer to war.

811
00:58:16,484 --> 00:58:18,504
See? If not for these,
you would not be here.

812
00:58:20,639 --> 00:58:21,640
I'm trying to...

813
00:58:22,056 --> 00:58:23,157
what do you call it?

814
00:58:23,325 --> 00:58:24,976
That's an olive branch.

815
00:58:26,119 --> 00:58:27,221
Is that what you call it?

816
00:58:29,039 --> 00:58:31,099
Is Pepper here? I didn't see her.

817
00:58:32,751 --> 00:58:33,715
We're...

818
00:58:34,574 --> 00:58:35,445
kinda...

819
00:58:35,726 --> 00:58:37,495
Well, not kinda,
Pregnant?

820
00:58:37,756 --> 00:58:39,257
No. Definitely not.

821
00:58:39,424 --> 00:58:40,618
We're taking a break.

822
00:58:41,508 --> 00:58:42,626
It's nobody's fault.

823
00:58:44,327 --> 00:58:46,126
I'm so sorry, Tony. I didn't know.

824
00:58:46,617 --> 00:58:49,727
A few years ago, I almost lost her,
so I trashed all my suits.

825
00:58:50,518 --> 00:58:52,174
Then, we had to mop up HYDRA,

826
00:58:52,187 --> 00:58:54,147
and then Ultron. My fault.

827
00:58:55,065 --> 00:58:57,876
And then, and then, and then,
I never stopped.

828
00:58:58,443 --> 00:59:00,520
Because the truth is
I don't wanna stop.

829
00:59:02,197 --> 00:59:03,627
I don't wanna lose her.

830
00:59:04,407 --> 00:59:06,790
I thought maybe the Accords
could split the difference.

831
00:59:10,664 --> 00:59:12,326
In her defense, I'm a handful.

832
00:59:14,042 --> 00:59:15,948
Yet, Dad was a pain in the ass,

833
00:59:16,586 --> 00:59:18,208
but he and Mom always made it work.

834
00:59:18,389 --> 00:59:19,934
I'm glad Howard got married.

835
00:59:20,715 --> 00:59:22,514
I only knew him
when he was young and single.

836
00:59:22,662 --> 00:59:24,398
Oh, really?
You two knew each other?

837
00:59:24,914 --> 00:59:26,028
He never mentioned that.

838
00:59:26,309 --> 00:59:28,366
Maybe only a thousand times.

839
00:59:29,641 --> 00:59:31,017
God, I hated you.

840
00:59:33,019 --> 00:59:34,505
I don't mean to make things difficult.

841
00:59:34,602 --> 00:59:36,534
I know, because
you're a very polite person.

842
00:59:37,732 --> 00:59:40,026
If I see a situation pointed south,

843
00:59:40,860 --> 00:59:42,061
I can't ignore it.

844
00:59:42,601 --> 00:59:43,822
Sometimes I wish I could.

845
00:59:43,989 --> 00:59:45,031
No, you don't.

846
00:59:48,119 --> 00:59:49,132
No, I don't.

847
00:59:50,750 --> 00:59:51,536
Sometimes...

848
00:59:51,538 --> 00:59:54,112
Sometimes I wanna
punch you in your perfect teeth.

849
00:59:55,166 --> 00:59:56,626
But I don't wanna see you gone.

850
00:59:57,377 --> 00:59:58,613
We need you, Cap.

851
00:59:59,587 --> 01:00:02,534
So far, nothing's happened
that can't be undone, if you sign.

852
01:00:03,466 --> 01:00:05,343
We can make the last 24 hours legit.

853
01:00:05,510 --> 01:00:07,608
Barnes gets transferred
to an American psych-center,

854
01:00:07,610 --> 01:00:09,438
instead of a Wakandan prison.

855
01:00:21,879 --> 01:00:23,521
I'm not saying it's impossible but...

856
01:00:23,882 --> 01:00:25,333
there would have to be safeguards.

857
01:00:25,335 --> 01:00:26,059
Sure.

858
01:00:26,656 --> 01:00:28,191
Once we put out the PR fire,

859
01:00:28,251 --> 01:00:30,152
those documents can be amended.

860
01:00:30,715 --> 01:00:32,832
I'd file a motion to have
you and Wanda reinstated.

861
01:00:32,834 --> 01:00:34,008
Wanda? What about Wanda?

862
01:00:34,126 --> 01:00:36,361
She's fine. She's confined
to the compound, currently.

863
01:00:36,363 --> 01:00:37,607
Vision's keeping her company.

864
01:00:37,609 --> 01:00:38,811
Oh, God, Tony.

865
01:00:38,813 --> 01:00:40,251
Every time. every time I think

866
01:00:40,253 --> 01:00:42,724
you see things the right way,
It's 100 acres with a lap pool.

867
01:00:42,726 --> 01:00:45,117
It's got a screening room.
There's worse ways to protect people.

868
01:00:45,121 --> 01:00:46,164
Protection?

869
01:00:46,593 --> 01:00:47,677
Is that how you see this?

870
01:00:47,691 --> 01:00:49,904
This is protection?
It's internment, Tony.

871
01:00:49,906 --> 01:00:51,382
She's not a US citizen.
Oh, come on, Tony.

872
01:00:51,389 --> 01:00:53,327
And they don't grant visas
to weapons of mass destruction.

873
01:00:53,329 --> 01:00:55,075
She's a kid!
Give me a break!

874
01:00:56,325 --> 01:00:57,888
I'm doing what has to be done.

875
01:00:59,035 --> 01:01:00,640
To stave off something worse.

876
01:01:03,693 --> 01:01:05,170
You keep telling yourself that.

877
01:01:08,940 --> 01:01:10,509
Hate to break up the set.

878
01:01:17,457 --> 01:01:18,834
<i>Hello, Mr Barnes.</i>

879
01:01:19,415 --> 01:01:21,946
<i>I've been sent by
the United Nations to evaluate you.</i>

880
01:01:22,428 --> 01:01:23,639
<i>Do you mind if I sit?</i>

881
01:01:29,677 --> 01:01:31,388
<i>Your first name is James?</i>

882
01:01:32,662 --> 01:01:34,281
The receipt for your gear.

883
01:01:36,643 --> 01:01:38,311
Bird costume? Come on.

884
01:01:38,368 --> 01:01:39,478
I didn't write it.

885
01:01:46,272 --> 01:01:47,740
<i>I'm not here to judge you.</i>

886
01:01:48,339 --> 01:01:50,348
<i>I just want to ask you a few questions.</i>

887
01:01:51,491 --> 01:01:53,343
<i>Do you know where you are, James?</i>

888
01:01:56,913 --> 01:01:59,624
<i>I can't help you if you
don't talk to me, James.</i>

889
01:02:00,583 --> 01:02:02,023
<i>My name is BUCKY.</i>

890
01:02:11,177 --> 01:02:12,187
Hello?

891
01:02:19,769 --> 01:02:20,563
Hey!

892
01:02:21,071 --> 01:02:22,550
A delivery for you.

893
01:02:27,597 --> 01:02:28,149
Ok

894
01:02:29,624 --> 01:02:31,890
Yeah. Sign here please.

895
01:02:32,828 --> 01:02:33,857
Here?
Yes.

896
01:02:41,486 --> 01:02:43,825
Why would the Task Force
release this photo to begin with?

897
01:02:44,419 --> 01:02:46,713
Get the word out,
involve as many eyes as we can?

898
01:02:46,762 --> 01:02:47,481
Right.

899
01:02:48,110 --> 01:02:49,698
It's a good way to flush
a guy out of hiding.

900
01:02:49,924 --> 01:02:51,730
Set off a bomb, get your picture taken.

901
01:02:51,999 --> 01:02:54,063
Get seven billion people looking
for the Winter Soldier.

902
01:02:54,155 --> 01:02:55,990
You're saying someone
framed him to find him?

903
01:02:56,069 --> 01:02:58,339
Steve, we looked for the guy for
two years and found nothing.

904
01:02:58,558 --> 01:03:00,606
We didn't bomb the UN.
That turns a lot of heads.

905
01:03:00,643 --> 01:03:02,037
Yeah, but that doesn't guarantee that

906
01:03:02,039 --> 01:03:03,267
whoever framed him would get him.

907
01:03:03,269 --> 01:03:04,804
It guarantees that we would.

908
01:03:11,346 --> 01:03:12,346
Yeah.

909
01:03:15,061 --> 01:03:16,279
Tell me BUCKY.

910
01:03:16,743 --> 01:03:18,752
You've seen a great deal, haven't you?

911
01:03:20,658 --> 01:03:22,457
<i>I don't wanna talk about it.</i>

912
01:03:23,249 --> 01:03:25,650
You fear that if you open your mouth,

913
01:03:25,814 --> 01:03:27,554
the horrors might never stop.

914
01:03:31,533 --> 01:03:32,618
Don't worry.

915
01:03:35,637 --> 01:03:37,831
We only have to talk about one.

916
01:03:49,001 --> 01:03:50,100
Hey! What is this?

917
01:03:50,593 --> 01:03:51,426
What this?

918
01:04:01,867 --> 01:04:03,723
Come on, guys,
get me eyes on Barnes.

919
01:04:04,958 --> 01:04:07,544
Friday, get me a source on that outage.

920
01:04:08,836 --> 01:04:10,680
Sub-level five, East Wing.

921
01:04:14,446 --> 01:04:15,905
What the hell is this?

922
01:04:15,939 --> 01:04:17,566
Why don't we discuss your home?

923
01:04:17,804 --> 01:04:18,804
Not Romania.

924
01:04:19,120 --> 01:04:20,772
Certainly not Brooklyn no.

925
01:04:22,188 --> 01:04:22,884
I mean...

926
01:04:24,041 --> 01:04:25,576
your real home.

927
01:04:31,397 --> 01:04:32,472
Longing

928
01:04:33,486 --> 01:04:34,203
No.

929
01:04:35,947 --> 01:04:36,656
Rusted.

930
01:04:37,193 --> 01:04:37,943
Stop.

931
01:04:38,372 --> 01:04:39,614
Seventeen.

932
01:04:41,828 --> 01:04:42,544
Stop.

933
01:04:44,780 --> 01:04:46,206
Daybreak.

934
01:04:52,463 --> 01:04:53,412
Furnace.

935
01:04:56,009 --> 01:04:57,009
Nine.

936
01:05:00,054 --> 01:05:01,049
Benign.

937
01:05:04,684 --> 01:05:06,235
Homecoming.

938
01:05:07,061 --> 01:05:07,881
One.

939
01:05:09,522 --> 01:05:10,522
Freight car.

940
01:05:26,924 --> 01:05:28,050
Soldier?

941
01:05:31,062 --> 01:05:32,420
Ready to comply.

942
01:05:33,254 --> 01:05:34,673
Mission report.

943
01:05:35,479 --> 01:05:37,053
December 16,

944
01:05:37,055 --> 01:05:38,675
1991.

945
01:05:49,312 --> 01:05:50,308
Help me.

946
01:05:51,272 --> 01:05:52,177
Help.

947
01:05:55,276 --> 01:05:56,277
Get up.

948
01:05:59,739 --> 01:06:01,256
Who are you? What do you want?

949
01:06:02,950 --> 01:06:04,952
To see an empire fall.

950
01:06:36,726 --> 01:06:37,380
Hey.

951
01:06:44,826 --> 01:06:46,367
Evac all civilians.

952
01:06:46,369 --> 01:06:48,880
Get me a perimeter around the building,
and gunships in the air.

953
01:06:48,882 --> 01:06:50,383
Please tell me you brought a suit.

954
01:06:50,456 --> 01:06:53,040
Sure did. It's a lovely Tom Ford,
three-piece, two-button.

955
01:06:53,042 --> 01:06:54,544
I'm an active-duty non-combatant.

956
01:06:55,169 --> 01:06:56,090
Follow me.

957
01:07:13,354 --> 01:07:14,700
<i>We're in position.</i>

958
01:07:46,929 --> 01:07:48,948
You could at least recognise me.

959
01:08:41,984 --> 01:08:43,194
Damn it.

960
01:10:20,499 --> 01:10:22,710
<i>He asked me again
if you were going to be there.</i>

961
01:10:22,793 --> 01:10:24,754
<i>I said I wasn't sure.</i>

962
01:10:24,837 --> 01:10:27,406
<i>You should have seen his
little face. Just try, ok?</i>

963
01:10:28,341 --> 01:10:29,698
<i>I'm going to bed.</i>

964
01:10:30,259 --> 01:10:31,577
<i>I love you.</i>

965
01:10:35,556 --> 01:10:39,560
<i>James Barnes the suspect
in the UN Vienna bombing,</i>

966
01:10:39,562 --> 01:10:40,860
<i>escaped custody today.</i>

967
01:10:41,296 --> 01:10:44,398
<i>Also missing Avenger
Captain Steve Rogers,</i>

968
01:10:44,400 --> 01:10:45,400
<i>and Sam Wilson.</i>

969
01:11:09,548 --> 01:11:10,549
Hey, Cap!

970
01:11:23,354 --> 01:11:24,438
Steve.

971
01:11:25,439 --> 01:11:26,906
Which BUCKY am I talking to?

972
01:11:29,276 --> 01:11:31,135
Your mom's name was Sarah.

973
01:11:35,491 --> 01:11:38,403
You used to wear newspapers
in your shoes.

974
01:11:40,327 --> 01:11:41,537
Can't read that in a museum.

975
01:11:41,539 --> 01:11:43,364
Just like that,
we're supposed to be cool?

976
01:11:43,747 --> 01:11:44,944
What did I do?

977
01:11:45,167 --> 01:11:45,918
Enough.

978
01:11:45,936 --> 01:11:47,729
Oh, God, I knew this would happen.

979
01:11:47,974 --> 01:11:50,268
Everything HYDRA
put inside me is still there.

980
01:11:50,799 --> 01:11:52,735
All he had to do
was say the goddamn words.

981
01:11:52,737 --> 01:11:54,267
Who was he?
I don't know.

982
01:11:54,427 --> 01:11:55,469
People are dead.

983
01:11:55,650 --> 01:11:56,841
The bombing, the setup,

984
01:11:56,843 --> 01:11:58,971
the doctor did all that just
to get 10 minutes with you.

985
01:11:59,057 --> 01:12:00,933
I need you to do better
than I don't know.

986
01:12:04,645 --> 01:12:06,734
He wanted to know about Siberia.

987
01:12:09,942 --> 01:12:11,403
Where I was kept.

988
01:12:13,695 --> 01:12:15,446
He wanted to know exactly where.

989
01:12:15,448 --> 01:12:16,721
Why would he need to know that?

990
01:12:19,744 --> 01:12:22,079
Because I'm not
the only Winter Soldier.

991
01:13:15,800 --> 01:13:17,138
It hurts!

992
01:13:54,547 --> 01:13:55,715
Good work.

993
01:14:07,393 --> 01:14:08,769
Get me out of here.

994
01:14:22,783 --> 01:14:23,909
Who were they?

995
01:14:24,076 --> 01:14:25,661
Their most elite death squad.

996
01:14:25,828 --> 01:14:28,279
More kills than anyone
in HYDRA history.

997
01:14:28,528 --> 01:14:29,796
And that was before the serum.

998
01:14:29,804 --> 01:14:31,066
They all turn out like you?

999
01:14:31,247 --> 01:14:32,059
Worse.

1000
01:14:32,785 --> 01:14:33,593
The doctor,

1001
01:14:33,799 --> 01:14:34,734
could he control them?

1002
01:14:35,405 --> 01:14:36,319
Enough.

1003
01:14:37,155 --> 01:14:38,718
He said he wanted
to see an empire fall.

1004
01:14:38,742 --> 01:14:40,036
With these guys, he could do it.

1005
01:14:40,184 --> 01:14:43,220
They speak 30 languages,
can hide in plain sight,

1006
01:14:43,404 --> 01:14:45,614
infiltrate, assassinate, destabilize.

1007
01:14:45,620 --> 01:14:47,966
They can take a whole
country down in one night,

1008
01:14:47,977 --> 01:14:49,320
you'd never see them coming.

1009
01:14:51,512 --> 01:14:53,656
This would have been
a lot easier a week ago.

1010
01:14:54,239 --> 01:14:56,231
If we call Tony.
No, he won't believe us.

1011
01:14:56,311 --> 01:14:57,247
Even if he did.

1012
01:14:57,249 --> 01:14:59,158
Who knows if the Accords
would let him help.

1013
01:15:00,743 --> 01:15:01,744
We're on our own.

1014
01:15:02,990 --> 01:15:03,990
Maybe not.

1015
01:15:05,910 --> 01:15:06,936
I know a guy.

1016
01:15:08,123 --> 01:15:11,505
I don't suppose you have
any idea where they are?

1017
01:15:11,623 --> 01:15:12,623
We will.

1018
01:15:12,625 --> 01:15:14,210
GSG 9's got the borders covered.

1019
01:15:14,212 --> 01:15:16,005
Recon's flying 24/7.

1020
01:15:16,501 --> 01:15:17,810
They'll get a hit. We'll handle it.

1021
01:15:17,812 --> 01:15:19,689
You don't get it, Stark.
It's not yours to handle.

1022
01:15:19,959 --> 01:15:22,121
It's clear you can't be objective.

1023
01:15:22,394 --> 01:15:23,896
I'm putting Special Ops on this.

1024
01:15:23,956 --> 01:15:25,342
What happens
when the shooting starts?

1025
01:15:25,344 --> 01:15:26,637
What, do you kill Steve Rogers?

1026
01:15:26,639 --> 01:15:27,961
If we're provoked.

1027
01:15:28,140 --> 01:15:31,435
Barnes would have been eliminated
in Romania if it wasn't for Rogers.

1028
01:15:31,765 --> 01:15:35,251
There are dead people
who would be alive now.

1029
01:15:36,482 --> 01:15:38,070
Feel free to check my math.

1030
01:15:38,072 --> 01:15:41,035
All due respect you're not gonna solve
this with boys and bullets, Ross.

1031
01:15:41,387 --> 01:15:42,527
You got to let us bring them in.

1032
01:15:42,529 --> 01:15:44,489
How would that end
any differently than last time?

1033
01:15:44,650 --> 01:15:47,666
Because this time I won't be
wearing loafers and a silk shirt.

1034
01:15:48,604 --> 01:15:50,604
72 hours, guaranteed.

1035
01:15:51,019 --> 01:15:52,118
36 hours.

1036
01:15:54,359 --> 01:15:55,455
Barnes.

1037
01:15:57,114 --> 01:15:58,282
Rogers.

1038
01:15:59,038 --> 01:16:00,038
Wilson.

1039
01:16:00,214 --> 01:16:01,124
Thank you, sir.

1040
01:16:05,956 --> 01:16:07,857
My left arm is numb. Is that normal?

1041
01:16:10,975 --> 01:16:12,059
You alright?

1042
01:16:12,826 --> 01:16:13,669
Always.

1043
01:16:17,398 --> 01:16:19,328
36 hours. Jeez.

1044
01:16:19,817 --> 01:16:21,777
We're seriously understaffed.

1045
01:16:22,027 --> 01:16:22,920
Oh, yeah.

1046
01:16:23,362 --> 01:16:25,411
It'd be great if we had
a Hulk right about now.

1047
01:16:25,474 --> 01:16:26,413
Any shot?

1048
01:16:28,436 --> 01:16:30,756
You really think he'd be on our side?

1049
01:16:31,109 --> 01:16:31,919
No.

1050
01:16:32,288 --> 01:16:33,364
I have an idea.

1051
01:16:33,747 --> 01:16:34,580
Me, too.

1052
01:16:35,251 --> 01:16:36,072
Where's yours?

1053
01:16:36,250 --> 01:16:37,432
Downstairs.

1054
01:16:38,210 --> 01:16:39,378
Where's yours?

1055
01:17:01,517 --> 01:17:02,204
Hey, May.

1056
01:17:02,901 --> 01:17:03,577
Hey.

1057
01:17:06,452 --> 01:17:07,827
How was school today?

1058
01:17:08,115 --> 01:17:09,026
It was ok.

1059
01:17:09,447 --> 01:17:11,540
This crazy car parked outside.

1060
01:17:15,331 --> 01:17:16,346
Oh, Mr Parker.

1061
01:17:19,293 --> 01:17:21,135
What... What are you doing...

1062
01:17:21,503 --> 01:17:23,383
Hey! I'm... I'm Peter.

1063
01:17:23,667 --> 01:17:24,466
Tony.

1064
01:17:25,316 --> 01:17:26,860
What are you... What are you...
What are you doing here?

1065
01:17:26,925 --> 01:17:27,931
It's about time we met.

1066
01:17:28,158 --> 01:17:29,552
You've been getting my emails, right?

1067
01:17:30,083 --> 01:17:31,805
Yeah. Yeah.
Right?

1068
01:17:32,014 --> 01:17:33,015
Regarding the...

1069
01:17:33,017 --> 01:17:34,161
You didn't even tell me
about the grant.

1070
01:17:34,266 --> 01:17:35,973
About the grant.
The September Foundation.

1071
01:17:35,975 --> 01:17:36,872
Right.
Yeah.

1072
01:17:36,874 --> 01:17:38,017
Remember when you applied?

1073
01:17:38,656 --> 01:17:40,039
Yeah.
I approved,

1074
01:17:40,252 --> 01:17:41,714
so now we're in business.

1075
01:17:42,769 --> 01:17:44,649
But you didn't tell me anything.
What's up with that?

1076
01:17:44,651 --> 01:17:45,795
You keeping secrets from me now?

1077
01:17:45,797 --> 01:17:48,993
I just know how much you love surprises
so I thought I would let you know...

1078
01:17:50,789 --> 01:17:51,807
Anyway, what did I apply for?

1079
01:17:51,840 --> 01:17:53,032
That's what I'm here to hash out.
Ok.

1080
01:17:53,323 --> 01:17:54,546
Hash it out, ok.

1081
01:17:54,578 --> 01:17:57,206
It's so hard for me to believe
that she's someone's aunt.

1082
01:17:57,373 --> 01:17:59,858
Yeah well, we come in
all shapes and sizes, you know?

1083
01:18:00,084 --> 01:18:02,486
This walnut date loaf is exceptional.

1084
01:18:02,488 --> 01:18:03,809
Let me just stop you there.
Yeah.

1085
01:18:03,962 --> 01:18:07,439
Is this grant got money
involved or whatever?

1086
01:18:07,441 --> 01:18:07,923
No?

1087
01:18:07,925 --> 01:18:10,123
Yeah, it's pretty well funded.
Yeah?

1088
01:18:10,559 --> 01:18:11,887
Look who you're talking to.

1089
01:18:12,780 --> 01:18:14,402
Can I have five minutes with him?
Sure.

1090
01:18:20,270 --> 01:18:23,565
As walnut date loaves go,
that wasn't bad.

1091
01:18:25,858 --> 01:18:27,353
What have we here?
Retro tech.

1092
01:18:27,861 --> 01:18:29,613
Thrift store? Salvation Army?

1093
01:18:29,822 --> 01:18:31,777
The garbage actually.
You're a dumpster diver?

1094
01:18:31,779 --> 01:18:32,721
Yeah I was...

1095
01:18:32,957 --> 01:18:34,117
Anyway, look I...

1096
01:18:34,618 --> 01:18:36,338
I definitely did not apply for your grant,

1097
01:18:36,812 --> 01:18:37,855
Me first.
Ok.

1098
01:18:38,038 --> 01:18:40,370
Quick question of the rhetorical variety.

1099
01:18:41,875 --> 01:18:43,836
That's you, right?

1100
01:18:44,320 --> 01:18:45,321
No.

1101
01:18:45,379 --> 01:18:46,559
What do. What do you mean?
Yeah.

1102
01:18:47,840 --> 01:18:49,040
Look at you go.

1103
01:18:49,633 --> 01:18:52,553
Nice catch.
3,000 pounds, 40 miles an hour.

1104
01:18:52,928 --> 01:18:53,916
That's not easy.

1105
01:18:54,609 --> 01:18:55,812
You got mad skills.

1106
01:18:55,814 --> 01:18:57,649
That's all on YouTube, though, right?

1107
01:18:57,787 --> 01:18:59,189
I mean that's where you found that?

1108
01:18:59,518 --> 01:19:00,620
Because you know that's all fake.

1109
01:19:00,644 --> 01:19:01,844
It's all done on the computer.

1110
01:19:03,232 --> 01:19:05,259
It's like that video. What is it?
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

1111
01:19:05,352 --> 01:19:07,232
Oh, you mean like
those UFOs over Phoenix?

1112
01:19:07,234 --> 01:19:07,965
Exactly.

1113
01:19:08,420 --> 01:19:09,521
Oh, what have we here?

1114
01:19:12,286 --> 01:19:12,829
It's...

1115
01:19:16,271 --> 01:19:16,994
So...

1116
01:19:18,996 --> 01:19:20,576
You're the Spider-ling.

1117
01:19:20,998 --> 01:19:23,003
Crime-fighting spider.
You're Spider-Boy?

1118
01:19:25,812 --> 01:19:26,899
Spider-Man.

1119
01:19:27,671 --> 01:19:29,107
Not in that onesie, you're not.

1120
01:19:30,048 --> 01:19:31,433
It's not a onesie.

1121
01:19:33,385 --> 01:19:36,249
I don't believe this. I was actually
having a really good day today, Mr Stark.

1122
01:19:36,722 --> 01:19:40,239
Didn't miss my train, this perfectly good
DVD player was just sitting there and...

1123
01:19:40,650 --> 01:19:42,920
Algebra test, nailed it.

1124
01:19:44,014 --> 01:19:45,474
Who else knows? Anybody?

1125
01:19:46,982 --> 01:19:48,022
Nobody.

1126
01:19:48,647 --> 01:19:50,751
Not even your unusually attractive aunt?

1127
01:19:50,753 --> 01:19:51,218
No.

1128
01:19:51,827 --> 01:19:53,140
No. No. No no!

1129
01:19:53,142 --> 01:19:54,762
If she knew, she would freak out.

1130
01:19:54,865 --> 01:19:56,665
And when she freaks out, I freak out.

1131
01:19:56,667 --> 01:19:58,028
You know what I
think is really cool?

1132
01:19:58,030 --> 01:19:58,971
This webbing.

1133
01:20:00,162 --> 01:20:02,330
That tensile strength is off the charts.

1134
01:20:02,860 --> 01:20:03,999
Who manufactured that?

1135
01:20:04,291 --> 01:20:05,501
I did.

1136
01:20:06,723 --> 01:20:08,645
Climbing walls, how you doing that?

1137
01:20:08,659 --> 01:20:09,736
Adhesive gloves?

1138
01:20:10,036 --> 01:20:11,671
It's a long story. I was...

1139
01:20:11,673 --> 01:20:14,049
Lordy! Can you even see in these?

1140
01:20:14,051 --> 01:20:15,420
Yes. Yes, I can.

1141
01:20:15,422 --> 01:20:16,589
I can.
I'm blind!

1142
01:20:17,384 --> 01:20:18,969
I can. I can see in those.

1143
01:20:18,971 --> 01:20:19,483
Ok?

1144
01:20:19,839 --> 01:20:22,516
It's just that, when whatever
happened, happened,

1145
01:20:22,518 --> 01:20:24,548
it's like my senses
have been dialed to 11.

1146
01:20:25,354 --> 01:20:27,550
There's. There's way too much input so...

1147
01:20:27,961 --> 01:20:29,691
They. They just kinda help me focus.

1148
01:20:29,693 --> 01:20:31,645
You're in dire need of an upgrade.

1149
01:20:32,497 --> 01:20:35,012
Systemic, top to bottom,
hundred-point restoration.

1150
01:20:35,014 --> 01:20:36,140
That's why I'm here.

1151
01:20:38,825 --> 01:20:39,952
Why you doing this?

1152
01:20:41,370 --> 01:20:42,713
I got to know, what's your MO?

1153
01:20:42,715 --> 01:20:44,473
What gets you outta that
twin bed in the morning?

1154
01:20:45,165 --> 01:20:46,175
Because...

1155
01:20:50,420 --> 01:20:52,144
Because I've been me my whole life,

1156
01:20:52,464 --> 01:20:54,391
and I've had these powers
for six months.

1157
01:20:55,755 --> 01:20:57,635
I read books, I build computers.

1158
01:20:59,429 --> 01:21:01,541
And, and yeah I would love
to play football,

1159
01:21:02,182 --> 01:21:03,910
but I couldn't then,
so I should not now.

1160
01:21:03,912 --> 01:21:05,477
Sure, because you're different.
Exactly.

1161
01:21:05,664 --> 01:21:07,505
But I can't tell anybody that,
so I'm not.

1162
01:21:12,276 --> 01:21:14,279
When you can do the things
that I can,

1163
01:21:15,404 --> 01:21:16,596
but you don't,

1164
01:21:18,448 --> 01:21:19,975
and then the bad things happen,

1165
01:21:21,922 --> 01:21:23,354
they happen because of you.

1166
01:21:28,361 --> 01:21:31,347
So you wanna look out for the little guy,
you wanna do your part?

1167
01:21:31,419 --> 01:21:33,142
Make the world
a better place, all that, right?

1168
01:21:33,144 --> 01:21:35,566
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
just looking out for the little guy.

1169
01:21:36,925 --> 01:21:38,410
That's what it is.

1170
01:21:45,767 --> 01:21:47,736
I'm gonna sit here,
so you move the leg.

1171
01:21:57,096 --> 01:21:57,940
You got a passport?

1172
01:21:57,942 --> 01:22:00,032
No, I don't. I don't even have
a driver's license.

1173
01:22:00,034 --> 01:22:00,997
You ever been to Germany?

1174
01:22:00,999 --> 01:22:02,319
No.
Oh, you'll love it.

1175
01:22:02,403 --> 01:22:04,419
I can't go to Germany.
Why?

1176
01:22:06,830 --> 01:22:08,340
I got homework.

1177
01:22:08,707 --> 01:22:10,626
I'm gonna pretend you didn't say that.

1178
01:22:10,628 --> 01:22:13,005
No, I'm being serious.
I can't just drop out of school.

1179
01:22:13,007 --> 01:22:14,127
Might be a little dangerous.

1180
01:22:14,129 --> 01:22:16,289
Better tell Aunt Hottie
I'm taking you on a field trip.

1181
01:22:18,842 --> 01:22:20,044
Don't tell Aunt May.

1182
01:22:21,511 --> 01:22:22,596
Alright, Spider-Man.

1183
01:22:26,224 --> 01:22:27,434
Get me out of this.

1184
01:22:27,601 --> 01:22:28,644
Sorry. I'll get the...

1185
01:22:41,573 --> 01:22:42,824
What is it?

1186
01:22:42,991 --> 01:22:44,409
Stay here, please.

1187
01:22:50,923 --> 01:22:52,286
Guess I should knocked.

1188
01:22:52,876 --> 01:22:54,019
Oh, my God!

1189
01:22:54,443 --> 01:22:56,353
What are you doing here?

1190
01:22:56,396 --> 01:22:57,890
Disappointing my kids.

1191
01:23:02,173 --> 01:23:03,825
I'm supposed to go water-skiing.

1192
01:23:04,388 --> 01:23:05,981
Cap needs our help. Come on.

1193
01:23:06,515 --> 01:23:07,516
Clint!

1194
01:23:09,324 --> 01:23:10,617
You should not be here.

1195
01:23:13,063 --> 01:23:14,019
Really?

1196
01:23:14,908 --> 01:23:17,994
I retire for what, like five minutes,
and it all goes to shit.

1197
01:23:17,996 --> 01:23:20,513
Please consider
the consequences of your actions.

1198
01:23:20,629 --> 01:23:21,629
Ok, they're considered.

1199
01:23:22,906 --> 01:23:24,186
Ok, we got to go.

1200
01:23:28,787 --> 01:23:30,080
It's this way.

1201
01:23:30,640 --> 01:23:32,311
I've caused enough problems.

1202
01:23:37,003 --> 01:23:38,405
You got to help me, Wanda.

1203
01:23:38,594 --> 01:23:40,447
Look, you wanna mope,
you can go to high school.

1204
01:23:40,449 --> 01:23:42,894
You wanna make amends,
you get off your ass.

1205
01:23:43,593 --> 01:23:44,593
Shit.

1206
01:23:51,184 --> 01:23:52,836
I knew I should have stretched.

1207
01:24:06,533 --> 01:24:09,035
Clint, you can't overpower me.

1208
01:24:09,202 --> 01:24:10,806
I know I can't.

1209
01:24:11,621 --> 01:24:12,906
But she can.

1210
01:24:14,750 --> 01:24:17,836
Vision, that's enough. Let him go.

1211
01:24:18,754 --> 01:24:19,755
I'm leaving.

1212
01:24:19,880 --> 01:24:21,006
I can't let you.

1213
01:24:26,052 --> 01:24:27,217
I'm sorry.

1214
01:24:30,891 --> 01:24:32,595
If you do this,

1215
01:24:33,185 --> 01:24:36,188
they will never stop being afraid of you.

1216
01:24:37,647 --> 01:24:40,845
I can't control their fear, only my own.

1217
01:24:56,374 --> 01:24:58,735
Come on. We got one more stop.

1218
01:24:59,669 --> 01:25:01,379
It's just a matter of time.

1219
01:25:01,463 --> 01:25:04,280
Our satellites are running
facial, biometric,

1220
01:25:04,299 --> 01:25:05,926
and behavioral pattern scans.

1221
01:25:10,197 --> 01:25:12,732
Move or you will be moved.

1222
01:25:13,934 --> 01:25:16,255
As entertaining as that would be,

1223
01:25:16,770 --> 01:25:18,795
You really think you can find him?

1224
01:25:19,587 --> 01:25:21,255
My resources are considerable.

1225
01:25:21,274 --> 01:25:23,896
Yeah, it took the world
70 years to find Barnes,

1226
01:25:23,898 --> 01:25:26,266
so you could probably do that
in about half the time.

1227
01:25:27,509 --> 01:25:28,833
You know where they are.

1228
01:25:29,282 --> 01:25:30,788
I know someone who does.

1229
01:25:34,120 --> 01:25:36,665
Not sure you understand
the concept of a getaway car.

1230
01:25:36,748 --> 01:25:37,874
It's low profile.

1231
01:25:38,375 --> 01:25:41,127
Good, because this stuff
tends to draw a crowd.

1232
01:25:42,963 --> 01:25:44,464
Can you move your seat up?

1233
01:25:44,529 --> 01:25:45,487
No.

1234
01:25:46,077 --> 01:25:47,120
I owe you again.

1235
01:25:47,676 --> 01:25:49,016
Keeping a list.

1236
01:25:52,389 --> 01:25:54,140
You know, he kinda tried to kill me.

1237
01:25:55,058 --> 01:25:55,905
Sorry.

1238
01:25:56,142 --> 01:25:57,770
I'll put it on the list, too.

1239
01:26:01,106 --> 01:26:02,628
They're going to come looking for you.

1240
01:26:03,859 --> 01:26:04,859
I know.

1241
01:26:07,195 --> 01:26:08,441
Thank you, Sharon.

1242
01:26:24,293 --> 01:26:25,294
That was...

1243
01:26:25,297 --> 01:26:26,214
Late.

1244
01:26:26,360 --> 01:26:27,360
Damn right.

1245
01:26:31,803 --> 01:26:32,804
I should go.

1246
01:26:32,971 --> 01:26:33,807
Ok.

1247
01:26:58,538 --> 01:26:59,430
Cap.

1248
01:26:59,873 --> 01:27:02,143
You know I would not have called
if I had any other choice.

1249
01:27:02,167 --> 01:27:03,567
Hey, man, you're doing me a favour.

1250
01:27:03,710 --> 01:27:05,953
Besides, I owe a debt.

1251
01:27:06,212 --> 01:27:07,640
Thanks for having my back.

1252
01:27:07,923 --> 01:27:09,424
It was time to get off my ass.

1253
01:27:10,008 --> 01:27:11,635
How about our other recruit?

1254
01:27:11,988 --> 01:27:13,027
He's raring to go.

1255
01:27:14,186 --> 01:27:15,775
Had to put a little coffee in him but...

1256
01:27:16,965 --> 01:27:17,947
he should be good.

1257
01:27:21,117 --> 01:27:22,729
What time zone is this?

1258
01:27:22,896 --> 01:27:24,731
Come on. Come on.

1259
01:27:27,859 --> 01:27:29,778
Captain America!
Mr Lang.

1260
01:27:30,862 --> 01:27:32,006
It's an honor.

1261
01:27:32,405 --> 01:27:34,115
I'm shaking your hand too long.

1262
01:27:34,782 --> 01:27:35,782
This is awesome!

1263
01:27:35,842 --> 01:27:36,704
Captain America.

1264
01:27:36,729 --> 01:27:38,352
I know you, too. You're great!

1265
01:27:41,941 --> 01:27:42,942
Jeez.

1266
01:27:43,849 --> 01:27:44,849
Look, I wanna say,

1267
01:27:45,126 --> 01:27:47,112
I know you know
a lot of super people, so...

1268
01:27:48,171 --> 01:27:49,398
thinks for thanking of me.

1269
01:27:50,109 --> 01:27:51,967
Hey, man!
What's up, Tic Tac?

1270
01:27:52,717 --> 01:27:54,861
Good to see you, look,
what happened last time when I...

1271
01:27:54,863 --> 01:27:56,661
It was a great audition, but it'll...

1272
01:27:56,663 --> 01:27:58,154
it'll never happen again.

1273
01:27:58,390 --> 01:27:59,858
They tell you what we're up against?

1274
01:28:00,639 --> 01:28:01,844
Something about some...

1275
01:28:02,150 --> 01:28:03,556
psycho-assassins?

1276
01:28:04,153 --> 01:28:05,837
We're outside the law on this one.

1277
01:28:06,398 --> 01:28:08,182
So if you come with us,
you're a wanted man.

1278
01:28:08,900 --> 01:28:10,318
Yeah, well, what else is new?

1279
01:28:10,568 --> 01:28:11,568
We should get moving.

1280
01:28:11,611 --> 01:28:12,992
We got a chopper lined up.

1281
01:28:17,974 --> 01:28:19,654
They're evacuating the airport.

1282
01:28:19,957 --> 01:28:20,718
Stark.

1283
01:28:21,079 --> 01:28:21,868
Stark?

1284
01:28:23,594 --> 01:28:24,384
Suit up.

1285
01:28:46,116 --> 01:28:47,915
It's so weird how you run
into people at the airport.

1286
01:28:47,939 --> 01:28:49,625
Don't you think that's weird?
Definitely weird.

1287
01:28:49,649 --> 01:28:50,706
Hear me out, Tony.

1288
01:28:51,004 --> 01:28:52,655
That doctor, the psychiatrist,

1289
01:28:52,657 --> 01:28:54,071
he's behind all of this.

1290
01:28:57,449 --> 01:28:58,420
Captain.

1291
01:28:58,926 --> 01:28:59,865
Your Highness.

1292
01:29:00,411 --> 01:29:01,197
Anyway.

1293
01:29:01,619 --> 01:29:03,663
Ross gave me 36 hours
to bring you in.

1294
01:29:03,830 --> 01:29:05,546
That was 24 hours ago.

1295
01:29:05,795 --> 01:29:06,825
Can you help a brother out?

1296
01:29:06,921 --> 01:29:08,110
You're after the wrong guy.

1297
01:29:08,339 --> 01:29:09,958
Your judgment is askew.

1298
01:29:11,129 --> 01:29:13,169
Your old war buddy killed
innocent people yesterday.

1299
01:29:13,171 --> 01:29:15,192
And there are five more
super soldiers just like him.

1300
01:29:16,353 --> 01:29:18,678
I can't let the doctor
find them first, Tony. I can't.

1301
01:29:18,743 --> 01:29:19,743
Steve,

1302
01:29:20,712 --> 01:29:22,844
you know what's about to happen.

1303
01:29:23,141 --> 01:29:25,477
Do you really wanna
punch your way out of this one?

1304
01:29:29,689 --> 01:29:31,566
Alright, I've run out of patience.

1305
01:29:31,649 --> 01:29:32,650
Underoos!

1306
01:29:38,315 --> 01:29:39,334
Nice job, kid.

1307
01:29:39,757 --> 01:29:40,474
Thanks.

1308
01:29:40,533 --> 01:29:42,413
I could have stuck the landing
a little better, it's just...

1309
01:29:42,415 --> 01:29:44,441
New suit. Well it's nothing, Mr Stark.

1310
01:29:44,443 --> 01:29:45,682
It's perfect. Thank you.

1311
01:29:45,684 --> 01:29:47,395
Yeah, we don't really need
to start a conversation.

1312
01:29:47,397 --> 01:29:49,095
Ok. Cap. Captain.

1313
01:29:50,049 --> 01:29:51,417
Big fan. I'm Spider-Man.

1314
01:29:51,419 --> 01:29:52,438
Yeah, we'll talk about it later.

1315
01:29:52,462 --> 01:29:53,262
Just...

1316
01:29:53,264 --> 01:29:54,333
Hey, everyone.
Good job.

1317
01:29:54,920 --> 01:29:55,921
You've been busy.

1318
01:29:55,924 --> 01:29:57,524
And you've been a complete idiot.

1319
01:29:58,175 --> 01:29:59,175
Dragging in Clint.

1320
01:29:59,177 --> 01:30:00,718
Rescuing Wanda from a place

1321
01:30:00,720 --> 01:30:02,585
she doesn't even want
to leave, a safe place.

1322
01:30:02,748 --> 01:30:03,999
I'm trying to keep...

1323
01:30:05,558 --> 01:30:07,967
I'm trying to keep you from
tearing the Avengers apart.

1324
01:30:09,145 --> 01:30:10,442
You did that when you signed.

1325
01:30:12,357 --> 01:30:13,525
Alright, we're done.

1326
01:30:14,234 --> 01:30:16,407
You're gonna turn Barnes over
you're gonna come with us.

1327
01:30:16,501 --> 01:30:18,210
Now, because it's us,

1328
01:30:18,530 --> 01:30:19,969
or a squad of J-SOC guys,

1329
01:30:19,971 --> 01:30:22,073
with no compunction
about being impolite.

1330
01:30:24,702 --> 01:30:25,712
Come on.

1331
01:30:27,038 --> 01:30:27,997
<i>We found it.</i>

1332
01:30:29,874 --> 01:30:31,990
Their Quinjet's in hangar five,
north runway.

1333
01:30:36,172 --> 01:30:37,343
Alright, Lang.

1334
01:30:38,550 --> 01:30:39,736
Hey, guys, something,

1335
01:30:40,718 --> 01:30:41,862
What the hell was that?

1336
01:30:41,886 --> 01:30:43,788
I believe this is yours,
Captain America.

1337
01:30:44,055 --> 01:30:45,056
Oh, great.

1338
01:30:45,223 --> 01:30:46,534
Alright, there is two
on the parking deck.

1339
01:30:46,558 --> 01:30:48,119
One of them's Maximoff,
I'm gonna grab her.

1340
01:30:48,143 --> 01:30:49,635
Rhodey, you wanna take Cap?

1341
01:30:49,769 --> 01:30:51,771
Got two in the terminal,
Wilson and Barnes.

1342
01:30:51,938 --> 01:30:53,062
Barnes is mine.

1343
01:30:54,463 --> 01:30:55,779
Hey, Mr Stark, what should I do?

1344
01:30:55,802 --> 01:30:56,734
What we discussed.

1345
01:30:56,818 --> 01:30:57,878
Keep your distance, web them up.

1346
01:30:57,902 --> 01:30:59,112
Ok, copy that.

1347
01:31:03,992 --> 01:31:05,293
Move, Captain.

1348
01:31:05,743 --> 01:31:07,519
I won't ask a second time.

1349
01:31:09,937 --> 01:31:11,457
Look, I really don't want to hurt you.

1350
01:31:11,791 --> 01:31:13,209
I would not stress about it.

1351
01:31:25,430 --> 01:31:26,764
What the hell is that?

1352
01:31:26,931 --> 01:31:29,017
Everyone's got a gimmick now.

1353
01:31:35,730 --> 01:31:37,106
You have a metal arm?

1354
01:31:37,108 --> 01:31:38,454
That is awesome, dude.

1355
01:31:40,403 --> 01:31:42,069
You have the right to remain silent!

1356
01:31:56,597 --> 01:31:58,085
Sorry, Cap, this won't kill you,

1357
01:31:58,087 --> 01:31:59,407
but it ain't gonna tickle either.

1358
01:32:04,690 --> 01:32:06,608
Wanda, I think you hurt
Vision's feelings.

1359
01:32:06,610 --> 01:32:08,190
You locked me in my room.

1360
01:32:08,192 --> 01:32:09,847
Ok, first, that's an exaggeration.

1361
01:32:09,849 --> 01:32:11,759
Second, I did it to protect you.

1362
01:32:12,278 --> 01:32:13,597
Hey, Clint.
Hey, man.

1363
01:32:13,853 --> 01:32:15,718
Clearly, retirement doesn't suit you.

1364
01:32:15,730 --> 01:32:17,090
You got tired of shooting golf?

1365
01:32:17,254 --> 01:32:19,488
Well, I played 18, shot 18.

1366
01:32:20,690 --> 01:32:21,899
Just can't seem to miss.

1367
01:32:24,489 --> 01:32:25,782
First time for everything.

1368
01:32:25,949 --> 01:32:26,949
Made you look.

1369
01:32:37,502 --> 01:32:39,512
<i>Multiple contusions detected.</i>

1370
01:32:39,514 --> 01:32:41,041
Yeah, I detected that, too.

1371
01:32:48,888 --> 01:32:49,931
Oh, God!

1372
01:32:51,224 --> 01:32:52,850
Hey, buddy, I think you lost this!

1373
01:33:04,946 --> 01:33:06,239
Those wings carbon fibre?

1374
01:33:06,447 --> 01:33:07,612
Is this stuff coming out of you?

1375
01:33:07,639 --> 01:33:09,604
That would explain
the rigidity-flexibility ratio,

1376
01:33:09,606 --> 01:33:11,317
which, got to say,
that's awesome, man.

1377
01:33:11,319 --> 01:33:12,910
I don't know if you've
been in a fight before,

1378
01:33:12,912 --> 01:33:14,592
but there is usually
not this much talking.

1379
01:33:14,594 --> 01:33:15,757
Alright, sorry. My bad.

1380
01:33:20,795 --> 01:33:22,422
Guys, look, I'd love to keep this up,

1381
01:33:22,424 --> 01:33:24,051
but I've only got one job here today,

1382
01:33:24,053 --> 01:33:27,014
and I got to impress Mr Stark,
so, I'm really sorry.

1383
01:33:30,862 --> 01:33:32,442
You couldn't have done that earlier?

1384
01:33:33,433 --> 01:33:34,520
I hate you.

1385
01:33:41,346 --> 01:33:42,109
Great.

1386
01:33:42,306 --> 01:33:43,409
Hey, Cap, heads-up!

1387
01:33:45,486 --> 01:33:46,863
Throw it at this.

1388
01:33:47,447 --> 01:33:48,489
Now!

1389
01:33:51,993 --> 01:33:53,286
Oh, come on!

1390
01:33:56,247 --> 01:33:58,815
Oh man, I thought it was a water truck.

1391
01:33:59,951 --> 01:34:00,816
Sorry.

1392
01:34:03,087 --> 01:34:04,422
Alright, now I'm pissed.

1393
01:34:05,381 --> 01:34:06,716
Is this part of the plan?

1394
01:34:06,883 --> 01:34:08,426
Well, my plan was go easy on them.

1395
01:34:08,428 --> 01:34:09,513
You wanna switch it up?

1396
01:34:12,055 --> 01:34:13,055
There's our ride.

1397
01:34:15,516 --> 01:34:16,517
Come on!

1398
01:34:25,633 --> 01:34:26,717
Captain Rogers,

1399
01:34:27,612 --> 01:34:30,615
I know you believe
what you're doing is right.

1400
01:34:31,407 --> 01:34:33,081
But for the collective good,

1401
01:34:33,409 --> 01:34:35,272
you must surrender now.

1402
01:34:52,845 --> 01:34:54,246
What do we do, Cap?

1403
01:34:55,473 --> 01:34:56,536
We fight.

1404
01:34:58,518 --> 01:35:00,144
This is gonna end well.

1405
01:35:06,901 --> 01:35:08,319
They're not stopping.

1406
01:35:08,447 --> 01:35:09,447
Neither are we.

1407
01:35:40,476 --> 01:35:41,602
We're still friends, right?

1408
01:35:41,769 --> 01:35:43,364
Depends on how hard you hit me.

1409
01:35:52,276 --> 01:35:53,729
You were pulling your punches.

1410
01:35:58,494 --> 01:35:59,704
I didn't kill your father.

1411
01:35:59,836 --> 01:36:01,181
Then why did you run?

1412
01:36:19,765 --> 01:36:21,809
That thing does not obey
the laws of physics at all.

1413
01:36:21,811 --> 01:36:24,064
Look, kid, there is a lot going on here
that you don't understand.

1414
01:36:24,066 --> 01:36:25,351
Mr Stark said you'd say that.

1415
01:36:35,028 --> 01:36:37,072
He also said to go for your legs.

1416
01:36:48,920 --> 01:36:50,254
Clint, can you get him off me?

1417
01:36:50,421 --> 01:36:51,589
Buckled in?

1418
01:36:51,756 --> 01:36:53,331
Yeah. No, I'm good.

1419
01:36:53,341 --> 01:36:55,482
I'm good, Arrow Guy.
Let's go! Let's go!

1420
01:37:17,114 --> 01:37:18,491
Stark tell you anything else?

1421
01:37:18,658 --> 01:37:21,236
That you're wrong.
You think you're right.

1422
01:37:21,953 --> 01:37:23,329
That makes you dangerous.

1423
01:37:28,334 --> 01:37:29,752
Guess he had a point.

1424
01:37:34,840 --> 01:37:36,019
You got heart, kid.

1425
01:37:36,246 --> 01:37:37,194
Where you from?

1426
01:37:37,834 --> 01:37:38,844
Queens.

1427
01:37:40,471 --> 01:37:41,472
Brooklyn.

1428
01:37:47,436 --> 01:37:48,479
Friday?

1429
01:37:48,563 --> 01:37:50,314
<i>We have some weapon systems offline.</i>

1430
01:37:50,316 --> 01:37:51,056
What?

1431
01:37:51,190 --> 01:37:53,725
Oh, you're gonna have
to take this into the shop.

1432
01:37:53,934 --> 01:37:55,269
Who's speaking?

1433
01:37:55,436 --> 01:37:56,880
It's your conscience.

1434
01:37:57,105 --> 01:37:59,048
We don't talk a lot these days.

1435
01:37:59,156 --> 01:38:01,681
Friday?
<i>Deploying fire suppression system.</i>

1436
01:38:05,663 --> 01:38:06,664
Oh, boy!

1437
01:38:16,007 --> 01:38:17,031
We got to go.

1438
01:38:17,062 --> 01:38:18,580
That guy's probably in Siberia by now.

1439
01:38:18,582 --> 01:38:19,733
We got to draw out the flyers.

1440
01:38:20,081 --> 01:38:21,654
I'll take Vision, you get to the jet.

1441
01:38:21,656 --> 01:38:23,459
No, you get to the jet!

1442
01:38:23,598 --> 01:38:24,598
<i>Both of you!</i>

1443
01:38:27,018 --> 01:38:28,495
The rest of us aren't getting out of here.

1444
01:38:28,519 --> 01:38:29,663
As much as I hate to admit it,

1445
01:38:29,687 --> 01:38:31,147
<i>if we're gonna win this one,</i>

1446
01:38:31,149 --> 01:38:32,734
<i>some of us might have to lose it.</i>

1447
01:38:33,005 --> 01:38:34,710
<i>This isn't the real fight, Steve.</i>

1448
01:38:35,192 --> 01:38:36,805
Alright, Sam. What's the play?

1449
01:38:37,028 --> 01:38:39,113
We need a diversion. Something big.

1450
01:38:40,865 --> 01:38:42,491
I got something kinda big.

1451
01:38:42,575 --> 01:38:44,105
<i>But I can't hold it very long.</i>

1452
01:38:44,327 --> 01:38:46,450
<i>On my signal, run like hell.</i>

1453
01:38:46,537 --> 01:38:48,155
<i>And if I tear myself in half,</i>

1454
01:38:48,351 --> 01:38:50,550
<i>don't come back for me.</i>
He's gonna tear himself in half?

1455
01:38:50,603 --> 01:38:51,663
You sure about this, Scott?

1456
01:38:51,917 --> 01:38:52,974
<i>I do it all the time.</i>

1457
01:38:53,286 --> 01:38:54,083
<i>I mean, once.</i>

1458
01:38:54,598 --> 01:38:55,345
<i>In a lab.</i>

1459
01:38:55,546 --> 01:38:56,618
<i>Then I passed out.</i>

1460
01:38:57,381 --> 01:38:59,116
I'm the boss, I'm the boss, I'm the boss.

1461
01:39:15,274 --> 01:39:16,776
Holy shit!

1462
01:39:21,072 --> 01:39:23,236
Ok, tiny dude is big now.
He's big now.

1463
01:39:24,992 --> 01:39:26,077
I guess that's the signal.

1464
01:39:26,327 --> 01:39:27,787
Way to go, Tic Tac!

1465
01:39:29,664 --> 01:39:31,082
Give me back my Rhodey.

1466
01:39:34,752 --> 01:39:35,961
I got him.

1467
01:39:58,429 --> 01:40:01,153
Ok, anybody on our side
hiding any shocking

1468
01:40:01,155 --> 01:40:03,269
and fantastic abilities
they'd like to disclose,

1469
01:40:03,372 --> 01:40:04,685
I'm open to suggestions.

1470
01:40:12,373 --> 01:40:13,999
You wanna get to them,

1471
01:40:14,166 --> 01:40:15,681
you got to go through me.

1472
01:40:42,319 --> 01:40:43,779
We haven't met yet.

1473
01:40:46,365 --> 01:40:48,419
I'm Clint.
I don't care.

1474
01:41:15,895 --> 01:41:16,895
Get off!

1475
01:41:31,786 --> 01:41:33,496
Something just flew in me!

1476
01:41:57,728 --> 01:41:58,966
You're not gonna stop.

1477
01:41:59,458 --> 01:42:00,459
You know I can't.

1478
01:42:01,372 --> 01:42:02,498
I'm gonna regret this.

1479
01:42:06,153 --> 01:42:07,446
Go.

1480
01:42:13,118 --> 01:42:15,457
Hey, guys, you ever see
that really old movie,

1481
01:42:16,084 --> 01:42:17,412
Empire Strikes Back?

1482
01:42:17,414 --> 01:42:18,892
<i>Jesus, Tony, how old is this guy?</i>

1483
01:42:18,916 --> 01:42:20,060
I don't know, I didn't carbon-date him.

1484
01:42:20,084 --> 01:42:21,274
He's on the young side.

1485
01:42:23,128 --> 01:42:26,257
You know that part
where they're on the snow planet,

1486
01:42:27,508 --> 01:42:29,009
with the walking thingies?

1487
01:42:31,428 --> 01:42:32,614
Maybe the kid's onto something.

1488
01:42:32,638 --> 01:42:33,861
High now, Tony. Go high.

1489
01:42:42,106 --> 01:42:43,107
Yes!

1490
01:42:43,649 --> 01:42:45,234
That was awesome!

1491
01:42:59,957 --> 01:43:02,960
Does anyone have any orange slices?

1492
01:43:08,632 --> 01:43:09,726
Kid, you alright?
Hey!

1493
01:43:11,635 --> 01:43:13,242
Same side. Guess who.
Get out of me!

1494
01:43:13,270 --> 01:43:14,530
Hi. It's me.

1495
01:43:14,889 --> 01:43:16,029
Hey, man.
Yeah.

1496
01:43:16,114 --> 01:43:17,449
That was scary.
Yeah.

1497
01:43:17,516 --> 01:43:19,143
You're done, alright?

1498
01:43:19,483 --> 01:43:20,398
What?
You did a good job.

1499
01:43:20,400 --> 01:43:21,881
I'm good, I'm fine.
Stay down.

1500
01:43:21,883 --> 01:43:22,683
No, it's good. I got to get him back.

1501
01:43:22,685 --> 01:43:23,840
You're going home or I'll call Aunt May!

1502
01:43:23,981 --> 01:43:25,049
You're done!

1503
01:43:25,316 --> 01:43:26,145
Wait.

1504
01:43:26,525 --> 01:43:27,594
Mr Stark, wait.

1505
01:43:27,971 --> 01:43:29,300
I'm not done. I'm not,

1506
01:43:31,864 --> 01:43:33,707
Ok, I'm done. I'm done.

1507
01:43:50,174 --> 01:43:52,414
I said I'd help you find him,
not catch him.

1508
01:43:52,927 --> 01:43:54,511
There's a difference.

1509
01:44:01,054 --> 01:44:02,054
I'm sorry.

1510
01:44:02,937 --> 01:44:04,021
Me, too.

1511
01:44:04,939 --> 01:44:05,939
It's as I said.

1512
01:44:06,440 --> 01:44:07,818
Catastrophe.

1513
01:44:21,038 --> 01:44:22,873
Vision, I got a bandit on my six.

1514
01:44:27,628 --> 01:44:28,407
<i>Vision!</i>

1515
01:44:28,796 --> 01:44:31,088
<i>You copy? Target his thruster,
turn him into a glider.</i>

1516
01:44:45,980 --> 01:44:46,927
Rhodey!

1517
01:44:49,036 --> 01:44:50,587
Tony, I'm flying dead stick.

1518
01:44:58,909 --> 01:44:59,976
Rhodes!

1519
01:45:12,631 --> 01:45:13,791
Read vitals.

1520
01:45:14,258 --> 01:45:15,609
<i>Heartbeat detected.</i>

1521
01:45:15,917 --> 01:45:17,533
<i>Emergency medical is on its way.</i>

1522
01:45:22,928 --> 01:45:23,928
I'm sorry.

1523
01:45:41,874 --> 01:45:43,274
<i>Good morning, at your service.</i>

1524
01:45:43,298 --> 01:45:45,024
Good morning Mrs Leiber.

1525
01:45:45,654 --> 01:45:47,189
This is room 201.

1526
01:45:47,382 --> 01:45:48,483
<i>Hi Mr Müller.</i>

1527
01:45:48,586 --> 01:45:50,521
<i>Bacon and black coffee
again today?</i>

1528
01:45:51,608 --> 01:45:53,151
You know me so well.

1529
01:45:54,745 --> 01:45:56,653
Hello? Your breakfast is here.

1530
01:45:57,691 --> 01:45:59,012
May I let myself in?

1531
01:46:07,674 --> 01:46:08,874
Mr Müller?

1532
01:46:12,250 --> 01:46:13,450
Mr Müller?

1533
01:46:23,869 --> 01:46:25,496
What's gonna happen
to your friends?

1534
01:46:34,088 --> 01:46:35,317
Whatever it is,

1535
01:46:36,215 --> 01:46:37,441
I'll deal with it.

1536
01:46:40,830 --> 01:46:42,917
I don't know if I'm worth all this, Steve.

1537
01:46:50,229 --> 01:46:51,855
What you did all those years,

1538
01:46:52,898 --> 01:46:54,199
It wasn't you.

1539
01:46:55,234 --> 01:46:56,817
You didn't have a choice.

1540
01:46:58,195 --> 01:46:59,239
I know.

1541
01:47:02,399 --> 01:47:03,735
But I did it.

1542
01:47:18,841 --> 01:47:20,168
How did this happen?

1543
01:47:21,176 --> 01:47:22,723
I became distracted.

1544
01:47:25,472 --> 01:47:27,399
I didn't think that was possible.

1545
01:47:29,017 --> 01:47:30,586
Neither did I.

1546
01:47:47,244 --> 01:47:50,247
The doctors say
he shattered L4 through S1.

1547
01:47:50,414 --> 01:47:52,721
Extreme laceration to the spinal cord.

1548
01:47:53,333 --> 01:47:55,796
Probably looking at
some form of paralysis.

1549
01:47:59,298 --> 01:48:00,841
Steve's not gonna stop.

1550
01:48:01,714 --> 01:48:02,757
If you don't either,

1551
01:48:02,759 --> 01:48:04,154
Rhodey's gonna be
the best case scenario.

1552
01:48:04,178 --> 01:48:05,345
You let them go, Nat.

1553
01:48:05,512 --> 01:48:06,555
We played this wrong.

1554
01:48:06,558 --> 01:48:07,482
We?

1555
01:48:08,432 --> 01:48:11,118
Boy, it must be hard to shake
the whole double agent thing.

1556
01:48:11,120 --> 01:48:12,521
It sticks in the DNA.

1557
01:48:14,271 --> 01:48:17,159
Are you incapable of
letting go of your ego,

1558
01:48:17,169 --> 01:48:19,029
for one goddamn second?

1559
01:48:23,595 --> 01:48:25,525
T'Challa told Ross what you did, so...

1560
01:48:27,187 --> 01:48:28,560
they're coming for you.

1561
01:48:29,661 --> 01:48:31,914
I'm not the one that needs
to watch their back.

1562
01:48:41,048 --> 01:48:42,424
What am I looking at, Friday?

1563
01:48:42,507 --> 01:48:44,421
<i>Priority upload from Berlin police.</i>

1564
01:48:47,930 --> 01:48:49,431
Fire up the chopper.

1565
01:48:55,395 --> 01:48:57,275
<i>The Task Force called
for a psychiatrist</i>

1566
01:48:57,277 --> 01:48:59,032
<i>as soon as Barnes was captured.</i>

1567
01:48:59,191 --> 01:49:01,485
<i>The UN dispatched
Doctor Theo Broussard</i>

1568
01:49:01,487 --> 01:49:02,945
<i>from Geneva within the hour.</i>

1569
01:49:03,111 --> 01:49:04,864
<i>He was met by this man.</i>

1570
01:49:04,947 --> 01:49:06,462
Did you run facial recognition yet?

1571
01:49:06,464 --> 01:49:07,429
<i>What do I look like?</i>

1572
01:49:08,049 --> 01:49:09,329
I don't know.
I've been picturing a redhead.

1573
01:49:09,493 --> 01:49:11,036
<i>You must be thinking
of someone else.</i>

1574
01:49:11,246 --> 01:49:12,289
Must be.

1575
01:49:12,371 --> 01:49:15,140
<i>The fake doctor is actually
Colonel Helmut Zemo.</i>

1576
01:49:16,291 --> 01:49:17,960
<i>Sokovian Intelligence.</i>

1577
01:49:19,544 --> 01:49:21,505
<i>Zemo ran Echo Scorpion,</i>

1578
01:49:21,836 --> 01:49:24,102
<i>a Sokovian covert kill squad.</i>

1579
01:49:26,343 --> 01:49:27,844
So what happened
to the real Broussard?

1580
01:49:27,846 --> 01:49:29,855
<i>He was found dead
in a Berlin hotel room.</i>

1581
01:49:29,972 --> 01:49:33,048
<i>Where police also found
a wig and facial prosthesis,</i>

1582
01:49:33,049 --> 01:49:37,095
<i>approximating the appearance
of one James Buchanan Barnes.</i>

1583
01:49:37,938 --> 01:49:39,445
Son of a bitch.

1584
01:49:41,733 --> 01:49:43,601
Get this to Ross.
<i>Yes, boss.</i>

1585
01:51:17,329 --> 01:51:19,206
<i>This is Raft Prison Control.</i>

1586
01:51:19,331 --> 01:51:21,692
<i>You're cleared for landing, Mr Stark.</i>

1587
01:51:54,241 --> 01:51:56,201
So? You got the files?

1588
01:51:56,451 --> 01:51:57,619
Let's reroute the satellites,

1589
01:51:57,786 --> 01:51:59,704
start facial scanning for this Zemo guy.

1590
01:51:59,871 --> 01:52:01,541
You seriously think
I'm gonna listen to you

1591
01:52:01,543 --> 01:52:03,729
after that fiasco in Leipzig?

1592
01:52:04,376 --> 01:52:06,570
You're lucky you're not
in one of these cells.

1593
01:52:37,492 --> 01:52:39,820
The Futurist, gentlemen!

1594
01:52:40,287 --> 01:52:42,547
The Futurist is here!

1595
01:52:43,023 --> 01:52:44,524
He sees all!

1596
01:52:45,208 --> 01:52:48,295
He knows what's best for you,
whether you like it or not.

1597
01:52:48,879 --> 01:52:50,180
Give me a break, Barton.

1598
01:52:50,230 --> 01:52:52,291
<i>I had no idea they'd put you here.
Come on.</i>

1599
01:52:53,672 --> 01:52:55,886
Yeah, well, you knew
they'd put us somewhere, Tony.

1600
01:52:56,260 --> 01:52:59,253
Yeah, but not some
super-max floating ocean pokey.

1601
01:52:59,380 --> 01:53:01,757
You know this place is for maniacs.
This is a place for...

1602
01:53:02,031 --> 01:53:03,124
Criminals?

1603
01:53:04,436 --> 01:53:05,846
Criminals, Tony.

1604
01:53:06,730 --> 01:53:08,752
Think that's the word you're looking for.

1605
01:53:10,358 --> 01:53:11,401
Right?

1606
01:53:12,027 --> 01:53:13,625
That didn't used to mean me.

1607
01:53:14,279 --> 01:53:15,697
Or Sam, or Wanda.

1608
01:53:16,111 --> 01:53:17,173
But here we are.

1609
01:53:17,805 --> 01:53:18,982
Because you broke the law.

1610
01:53:19,082 --> 01:53:20,387
Yeah.
I didn't make you.

1611
01:53:21,703 --> 01:53:23,243
You read it, you broke it.

1612
01:53:25,081 --> 01:53:26,950
You're all grown up,
you got a wife and kids.

1613
01:53:27,375 --> 01:53:28,328
I don't understand,

1614
01:53:28,352 --> 01:53:30,305
why didn't you think about them
before you chose the wrong side?

1615
01:53:31,842 --> 01:53:33,803
You got to watch your back with this guy.

1616
01:53:35,050 --> 01:53:36,877
There's a chance he's gonna break it.

1617
01:53:38,678 --> 01:53:41,577
Hank Pym always said
you never can trust a Stark.

1618
01:53:42,724 --> 01:53:43,732
Who are you?

1619
01:53:44,893 --> 01:53:46,075
Come on, man.

1620
01:53:48,063 --> 01:53:49,105
How's Rhodes?

1621
01:53:49,201 --> 01:53:51,437
They're flying him
to Columbia Medical tomorrow so...

1622
01:53:52,255 --> 01:53:53,423
fingers crossed.

1623
01:53:55,222 --> 01:53:56,682
What do you need?
They feed you yet?

1624
01:53:58,698 --> 01:54:00,200
You're the good cop, now?

1625
01:54:00,909 --> 01:54:02,845
I'm just the guy who needs
to know where Steve went.

1626
01:54:02,969 --> 01:54:04,554
Well, you better go get a bad cop,

1627
01:54:04,621 --> 01:54:06,807
because you're gonna have
to go Mark Fuhrman on my ass,

1628
01:54:06,831 --> 01:54:08,248
to get information out of me.

1629
01:54:09,000 --> 01:54:10,940
Well, I just knocked
the A out of their AV.

1630
01:54:11,086 --> 01:54:13,964
We got about 30 seconds before
they realise it's not their equipment.

1631
01:54:14,923 --> 01:54:16,053
What'd you do?

1632
01:54:16,132 --> 01:54:17,345
Get it back up!

1633
01:54:18,760 --> 01:54:19,760
Just look.

1634
01:54:20,762 --> 01:54:21,994
Because that,

1635
01:54:22,495 --> 01:54:24,775
is the fellow who was
supposed to interrogate Barnes.

1636
01:54:26,059 --> 01:54:28,812
Clearly, I made a mistake.
Sam, I was wrong.

1637
01:54:28,854 --> 01:54:29,928
That's a first.

1638
01:54:30,381 --> 01:54:32,126
Cap is definitely off the reservation,

1639
01:54:32,128 --> 01:54:33,968
but he's about to need
all the help he can get.

1640
01:54:34,901 --> 01:54:36,442
We don't know each other very well.
You don't have to...

1641
01:54:36,444 --> 01:54:38,102
Hey, it's alright.

1642
01:54:46,541 --> 01:54:47,781
Look, I'll tell you,

1643
01:54:48,373 --> 01:54:49,821
but you have to go alone...

1644
01:54:50,143 --> 01:54:51,463
and as a friend.

1645
01:54:53,003 --> 01:54:54,045
Easy.

1646
01:54:57,085 --> 01:54:57,948
Stark?

1647
01:54:58,633 --> 01:55:00,284
Did he give you anything on Rogers?

1648
01:55:00,286 --> 01:55:01,499
Nope. Told me to go to hell.

1649
01:55:01,501 --> 01:55:03,252
I'm going back
to the compound instead but...

1650
01:55:03,597 --> 01:55:05,439
you can call me anytime.

1651
01:55:05,724 --> 01:55:07,904
I'll put you on hold.
I like to watch the line blink.

1652
01:56:16,920 --> 01:56:18,522
You remember that time
we had to ride back

1653
01:56:18,546 --> 01:56:20,757
from Rockaway Beach
in the back of that freezer truck?

1654
01:56:20,921 --> 01:56:23,069
Was that the time
we used our train money

1655
01:56:23,176 --> 01:56:24,481
to buy hot dogs?

1656
01:56:24,552 --> 01:56:27,800
You blew three bucks trying to win
that stuffed bear for a redhead.

1657
01:56:28,429 --> 01:56:29,430
What was her name, again?

1658
01:56:29,432 --> 01:56:31,606
Dolores. You called her Dot.

1659
01:56:31,810 --> 01:56:33,570
She's got to be
a hundred years old right now.

1660
01:56:33,723 --> 01:56:34,869
So are we, pal.

1661
01:56:44,489 --> 01:56:46,574
He can't have been here more
than a few hours.

1662
01:56:46,741 --> 01:56:48,543
Long enough to wake them up.

1663
01:57:30,910 --> 01:57:31,911
You ready?

1664
01:57:32,078 --> 01:57:33,079
Yeah.

1665
01:57:46,676 --> 01:57:48,678
You seem a little defensive.

1666
01:57:50,013 --> 01:57:51,339
It's been a long day.

1667
01:57:51,973 --> 01:57:53,974
At ease, Soldier.
I'm not currently after you.

1668
01:57:53,975 --> 01:57:55,185
Then why are you here?

1669
01:57:56,269 --> 01:57:58,238
Could be your story's not so crazy.

1670
01:57:59,105 --> 01:58:00,105
Maybe.

1671
01:58:01,733 --> 01:58:04,442
Ross has no idea I'm here.
I'd like to keep it that way.

1672
01:58:05,612 --> 01:58:07,265
Otherwise, I got to arrest myself.

1673
01:58:08,907 --> 01:58:10,587
Well, that sounds like
a lot of paperwork.

1674
01:58:14,245 --> 01:58:15,538
It's good to see you, Tony.

1675
01:58:15,747 --> 01:58:16,879
You too, Cap.

1676
01:58:17,874 --> 01:58:20,126
Hey, Manchurian Candidate,
you're killing me.

1677
01:58:20,210 --> 01:58:22,009
There's a truce here. You can drop,

1678
01:58:42,148 --> 01:58:43,483
I got heat signatures.

1679
01:58:43,650 --> 01:58:44,709
How many?

1680
01:58:46,852 --> 01:58:47,852
One.

1681
01:59:06,673 --> 01:59:08,467
<i>If it's any comfort,</i>

1682
01:59:09,050 --> 01:59:10,552
<i>they died in their sleep.</i>

1683
01:59:17,600 --> 01:59:20,087
<i>Did you really think
I wanted more of you?</i>

1684
01:59:21,855 --> 01:59:23,073
What the hell?

1685
01:59:24,357 --> 01:59:26,150
<i>I'm grateful to them, though.</i>

1686
01:59:27,352 --> 01:59:28,895
<i>They brought you here.</i>

1687
01:59:33,491 --> 01:59:34,952
<i>Please, Captain.</i>

1688
01:59:35,368 --> 01:59:37,282
<i>The Soviets built
this chamber to withstand</i>

1689
01:59:37,284 --> 01:59:39,870
<i>the launch blast of UR-100 rockets.</i>

1690
01:59:40,145 --> 01:59:41,791
I'm betting I could beat that.

1691
01:59:41,958 --> 01:59:43,758
<i>Oh, I'm sure you could, Mr Stark.</i>

1692
01:59:44,210 --> 01:59:45,465
<i>Given time.</i>

1693
01:59:46,212 --> 01:59:47,797
<i>But then you'd never
know why you came.</i>

1694
01:59:48,006 --> 01:59:50,466
You killed innocent people in Vienna
just to bring us here?

1695
01:59:57,265 --> 02:00:00,894
I've thought about
nothing else for over a year.

1696
02:00:01,561 --> 02:00:03,168
I studied you.

1697
02:00:03,813 --> 02:00:05,231
I followed you.

1698
02:00:06,177 --> 02:00:07,827
But now that you're standing here,

1699
02:00:08,003 --> 02:00:09,695
I just realised,

1700
02:00:11,988 --> 02:00:14,590
there is a bit of green
in the blue of your eyes.

1701
02:00:17,070 --> 02:00:18,953
How nice to find a flaw.

1702
02:00:20,055 --> 02:00:21,308
You're Sokovian.

1703
02:00:22,875 --> 02:00:24,208
Is that what this is about?

1704
02:00:24,375 --> 02:00:27,879
Sokovia was a failed state
long before you blew it to hell.

1705
02:00:27,980 --> 02:00:28,713
No.

1706
02:00:30,465 --> 02:00:32,805
I'm here because I made a promise.

1707
02:00:36,638 --> 02:00:37,847
You lost someone?

1708
02:00:41,726 --> 02:00:43,770
I lost everyone.

1709
02:00:45,605 --> 02:00:47,190
And so will you.

1710
02:00:53,859 --> 02:00:57,116
An empire toppled
by its enemies can rise again.

1711
02:00:58,201 --> 02:01:00,328
But one which crumbles from within?

1712
02:01:01,955 --> 02:01:03,456
That's dead.

1713
02:01:04,582 --> 02:01:05,583
Forever.

1714
02:01:14,347 --> 02:01:15,745
I know that road.

1715
02:01:18,429 --> 02:01:19,430
What is this?

1716
02:01:42,704 --> 02:01:44,330
<i>Help my wife.</i>

1717
02:01:45,456 --> 02:01:47,649
<i>Please. Help.</i>

1718
02:01:53,339 --> 02:01:54,587
<i>Sergeant Barnes?</i>

1719
02:01:56,175 --> 02:01:57,332
<i>Howard!</i>

1720
02:02:05,101 --> 02:02:06,144
<i>Howard!</i>

1721
02:02:43,352 --> 02:02:44,803
No, Tony. Tony.

1722
02:02:54,317 --> 02:02:55,526
Did you know?

1723
02:02:58,099 --> 02:02:59,350
I didn't know it was him.

1724
02:02:59,447 --> 02:03:01,966
Don't bullshit me, Rogers.
Did you know?

1725
02:03:06,111 --> 02:03:07,154
Yes.

1726
02:04:03,823 --> 02:04:04,938
Get out of here!

1727
02:04:16,479 --> 02:04:17,560
It wasn't him, Tony.

1728
02:04:17,567 --> 02:04:18,866
HYDRA had control of his mind!

1729
02:04:18,885 --> 02:04:19,693
Move!

1730
02:04:19,735 --> 02:04:20,736
It wasn't him!

1731
02:04:29,745 --> 02:04:31,080
<i>Left boot-jet failing.</i>

1732
02:04:31,956 --> 02:04:33,883
<i>Flight systems compromised.</i>

1733
02:04:34,792 --> 02:04:35,792
Crap.

1734
02:04:49,557 --> 02:04:51,274
He's not gonna stop. Go.

1735
02:05:14,290 --> 02:05:15,291
Come on, come on.

1736
02:05:15,458 --> 02:05:17,138
<i>Targeting system's knackered, boss.</i>

1737
02:05:17,210 --> 02:05:18,210
I'm eyeballing it.

1738
02:05:36,812 --> 02:05:38,439
Do you even remember them?

1739
02:05:38,829 --> 02:05:40,316
I remember all of them.

1740
02:06:03,172 --> 02:06:04,965
This isn't gonna change what happened.

1741
02:06:05,341 --> 02:06:06,348
I don't care.

1742
02:06:07,385 --> 02:06:08,653
He killed my mom.

1743
02:07:10,239 --> 02:07:12,876
<i>You should have seen his little face.
Just try, ok?</i>

1744
02:07:13,743 --> 02:07:15,010
<i>I'm going to bed.</i>

1745
02:07:15,745 --> 02:07:16,862
<i>I love you.</i>

1746
02:07:25,379 --> 02:07:27,416
I almost killed the wrong man.

1747
02:07:28,924 --> 02:07:30,521
Hardly an innocent one.

1748
02:07:31,093 --> 02:07:32,620
This is all you wanted?

1749
02:07:33,763 --> 02:07:35,847
To see them rip each other apart.

1750
02:07:40,227 --> 02:07:42,414
My father lived outside the city.

1751
02:07:43,968 --> 02:07:45,713
I thought we would be safe there.

1752
02:07:46,734 --> 02:07:48,192
My son was excited.

1753
02:07:48,778 --> 02:07:51,185
He could see the Iron Man
from the car window.

1754
02:07:52,615 --> 02:07:55,078
I told my wife, don't worry.

1755
02:07:55,993 --> 02:07:57,394
They're fighting in the city.

1756
02:07:57,998 --> 02:07:59,518
We're miles from harm.

1757
02:08:02,291 --> 02:08:04,027
When the dust cleared,

1758
02:08:05,359 --> 02:08:07,071
and the screaming stopped,

1759
02:08:08,589 --> 02:08:12,402
it took me two days
until I found their bodies.

1760
02:08:14,845 --> 02:08:16,230
My father,

1761
02:08:17,264 --> 02:08:20,667
still holding my wife
and son in his arms.

1762
02:08:25,201 --> 02:08:26,603
And the Avengers?

1763
02:08:28,275 --> 02:08:29,406
They went home.

1764
02:08:31,987 --> 02:08:33,737
I knew I couldn't kill them.

1765
02:08:34,323 --> 02:08:36,666
More powerful men
than me have tried.

1766
02:08:37,736 --> 02:08:38,611
But...

1767
02:08:39,161 --> 02:08:41,413
if I could get them to kill each other,

1768
02:08:45,835 --> 02:08:47,955
I'm sorry about your father.

1769
02:08:49,046 --> 02:08:50,681
He seemed a good man.

1770
02:08:52,675 --> 02:08:54,176
With a dutiful son.

1771
02:08:58,889 --> 02:09:01,016
Vengeance has consumed you.

1772
02:09:03,367 --> 02:09:05,003
It's consuming them.

1773
02:09:09,733 --> 02:09:11,819
I am done letting it consume me.

1774
02:09:15,531 --> 02:09:17,867
Justice will come soon enough.

1775
02:09:21,203 --> 02:09:23,038
Tell that to the dead.

1776
02:09:27,543 --> 02:09:29,654
The living are not done with you, yet.

1777
02:09:33,090 --> 02:09:34,951
<i>You can't beat him hand-to-hand.</i>

1778
02:09:36,677 --> 02:09:37,845
Analyze his fight pattern.

1779
02:09:38,137 --> 02:09:39,305
<i>Scanning.</i>

1780
02:09:44,018 --> 02:09:45,238
<i>Countermeasures ready.</i>

1781
02:09:47,229 --> 02:09:48,357
Let's kick his ass.

1782
02:10:01,911 --> 02:10:03,204
He's my friend.

1783
02:10:03,954 --> 02:10:04,997
So was I.

1784
02:10:12,046 --> 02:10:14,131
Stay down. Final warning.

1785
02:10:28,604 --> 02:10:29,974
I could do this all day.

1786
02:11:37,131 --> 02:11:38,800
That shield doesn't belong to you.

1787
02:11:41,010 --> 02:11:42,323
You don't deserve it.

1788
02:11:42,845 --> 02:11:44,453
My father made that shield!

1789
02:12:20,549 --> 02:12:22,384
Meals at 8 and 5.

1790
02:12:22,551 --> 02:12:24,178
Toilet privileges twice a day.

1791
02:12:26,555 --> 02:12:28,724
Raise your voice, zap.

1792
02:12:29,391 --> 02:12:31,393
Touch the glass, zap.

1793
02:12:31,727 --> 02:12:33,729
You step out of line, you deal with me.

1794
02:12:33,896 --> 02:12:35,865
Please, step out of line.

1795
02:12:38,275 --> 02:12:39,693
So how does it feel?

1796
02:12:40,611 --> 02:12:42,657
To spend all that time, all that effort,

1797
02:12:44,016 --> 02:12:44,658
and...

1798
02:12:45,949 --> 02:12:47,383
to see it fail,

1799
02:12:48,249 --> 02:12:49,895
so spectacularly.

1800
02:12:54,083 --> 02:12:55,234
Did it?

1801
02:13:21,617 --> 02:13:23,210
It's just the first pass.
Yeah.

1802
02:13:23,212 --> 02:13:25,421
Give me some feedback,
anything you think of.

1803
02:13:25,422 --> 02:13:27,891
Shock absorption, lateral movement.

1804
02:13:28,617 --> 02:13:29,618
Cup holder?

1805
02:13:29,637 --> 02:13:31,357
You may wanna think about
some AC down in,

1806
02:13:35,249 --> 02:13:36,489
Let's go. I'll give you a hand.

1807
02:13:36,625 --> 02:13:38,293
No. No. Don't help. Don't help me.

1808
02:13:54,351 --> 02:13:55,644
138.

1809
02:13:56,478 --> 02:13:58,235
138 combat missions.

1810
02:13:59,209 --> 02:14:00,913
That's how many I've flown, Tony.

1811
02:14:01,275 --> 02:14:03,838
Every one of them
could've been my last, but I flew them.

1812
02:14:06,391 --> 02:14:07,953
Because the fight needed to be fought.

1813
02:14:08,388 --> 02:14:10,015
It's the same with these Accords.

1814
02:14:10,534 --> 02:14:13,643
I signed because it was
the right thing to do.

1815
02:14:15,998 --> 02:14:17,841
And yeah, this sucks. This is...

1816
02:14:19,334 --> 02:14:20,747
This is a bad beat.

1817
02:14:23,213 --> 02:14:24,840
But it hasn't changed my mind.

1818
02:14:26,508 --> 02:14:27,556
I don't think.

1819
02:14:38,312 --> 02:14:39,688
You ok?
Oh, yeah.

1820
02:14:43,025 --> 02:14:45,373
Are you Tony Stank?

1821
02:14:46,236 --> 02:14:48,677
Yes, this is, this is Tony Stank.

1822
02:14:49,125 --> 02:14:50,415
You're in the right place.

1823
02:14:50,563 --> 02:14:51,973
Thank you for that!

1824
02:14:52,534 --> 02:14:54,369
Never dropping that, by the way.

1825
02:14:54,536 --> 02:14:56,455
Table for one, Mr Stank.

1826
02:14:56,607 --> 02:14:58,207
Please, by the bathroom.

1827
02:15:04,410 --> 02:15:05,410
<font color="#ff8000"><i>Tony,</i></font>

1828

<font color="#ff8000"><i>I'm glad you're back at the compound.</i></font>

1829

1836
02:15:28,737 --> 02:15:31,793
<font color="#ff8000"><i>My faith's in people, I guess.</i></font>

1837

1838
02:15:34,087 --> 02:15:36,731
<font color="#ff8000"><i>And I'm happy to say that,
for the most part,</i></font>

1839
02:15:37,454 --> 02:15:38,805
<font color="#ff8000"><i>they haven't let me down.</i></font>

1840
02:15:41,083 --> 02:15:43,410
<font color="#ff8000"><i>Which is why I can't let them down either.</i></font>

<font color="#ff8000"><i>by not telling you about your parents,</i></font>

I was really sparing myself.</i></font>

1847
02:16:03,939 --> 02:16:05,138
<font color="#ff8000"><i>And I'm sorry.</i></font>

1848

<i>There's been a breach at the Raft prison.</i>

1856
02:16:22,978 --> 02:16:24,204
Yeah, put him through.

1857
02:16:26,223 --> 02:16:27,480
<i>Tony, we have a problem.</i>

1858
02:16:27,699 --> 02:16:29,701
Please hold.
<i>No, don't.</i>

1859
02:16:32,259 --> 02:16:33,556
<font color="#ff8000"><i>So no matter what,</i></font>

1865
02:18:45,898 --> 02:18:47,241
You sure about this?

1866
02:18:48,895 --> 02:18:50,602
I can't trust my own mind.

1867
02:18:53,567 --> 02:18:56,283
So, until they figure out
how to get this stuff out of my head,

1868
02:18:56,319 --> 02:18:58,314
I think going back under is the best thing.

1869
02:18:59,489 --> 02:19:00,991
For everybody.

1870
02:19:23,263 --> 02:19:24,639
Thank you for this.

1871
02:19:27,142 --> 02:19:28,948
Your friend and my father,

1872
02:19:29,984 --> 02:19:31,612
they were both victims.

1873
02:19:33,482 --> 02:19:36,327
If I can help one of them find peace,

1874
02:19:39,654 --> 02:19:41,661
You know, if they find out he's here,

1875
02:19:42,532 --> 02:19:43,919
they'll come for him.

1876
02:19:46,338 --> 02:19:47,730
Let them try.

1877

1878
02:26:30,290 --> 02:26:32,066
So who was it? Who hit you?

1879
02:26:32,425 --> 02:26:33,401
Some guy.

1880
02:26:33,568 --> 02:26:35,195
So itchy, man, God.

1881
02:26:35,361 --> 02:26:36,571
What's some guy's name?

1882
02:26:37,222 --> 02:26:37,977
Steve.

1883
02:26:38,226 --> 02:26:40,228
Steve? From 12-C?

1884
02:26:40,575 --> 02:26:42,452
With the overbite?
No, no, no.

1885
02:26:42,454 --> 02:26:44,080
You don't know him.
He's from Brooklyn.

1886
02:26:48,416 --> 02:26:49,417
Well...

1887
02:26:50,210 --> 02:26:51,961
I hope you got a few good licks in.

1888
02:26:52,039 --> 02:26:54,163
Yeah, I got quite a few in, actually.

1889
02:26:55,215 --> 02:26:57,860
His friend was huge. Like huge.

1890
02:27:00,762 --> 02:27:02,022
That's way better.

1891
02:27:02,181 --> 02:27:03,098
Thank you.

1892
02:27:03,154 --> 02:27:04,398
Ok, tough guy.

1893
02:27:07,936 --> 02:27:09,128
Love you, May.

1894
02:27:09,434 --> 02:27:10,693
Hey, can you shut the door?
