1
00:00:35,077 --> 00:00:39,367
<i>No one in our land
had ever seen a dragon before.</i>

2
00:00:39,414 --> 00:00:42,998
<i>They were just legends
from the foggy isle of Britannia.</i>

3
00:00:43,043 --> 00:00:45,911
<i>Then the legends became real.</i>

4
00:00:45,963 --> 00:00:48,706
<i>Seven dragons
raised by the venerable Drago</i>

5
00:00:48,799 --> 00:00:51,542
<i>in the reign of King Gareth
left Britannia,</i>

6
00:00:51,635 --> 00:00:53,877
<i>spreading across the seven seas,</i>

7
00:00:53,929 --> 00:00:56,216
<i>and one of them landed here.</i>

8
00:00:57,558 --> 00:01:00,392
<i>It came to bring hope
to our war-torn kingdom,</i>

9
00:01:00,394 --> 00:01:03,637
<i>but something went wrong
and it was banished.</i>

10
00:01:04,356 --> 00:01:07,645
<i>In time, people only
spoke of it in whispers</i>

11
00:01:07,651 --> 00:01:09,688
<i>and the name
they gave to it...</i>

12
00:01:10,529 --> 00:01:11,861
<i>was "traitor."</i>

13
00:01:12,864 --> 00:01:15,607
<i>But our kingdom still needs hope.</i>

14
00:01:16,868 --> 00:01:20,828
<i>And sometimes,
it takes the most unlikely person</i>

15
00:01:20,872 --> 00:01:22,238
<i>to help you find it.</i>

16
00:01:25,168 --> 00:01:26,409
Just in there.

17
00:01:42,144 --> 00:01:44,352
Aw, come on, boys.
We have to get the last row plowed.

18
00:01:45,355 --> 00:01:46,937
Yes, Radu, I know it's cold,

19
00:01:46,982 --> 00:01:49,315
but this year's harvest was bad
and crop seeds scarce,

20
00:01:49,318 --> 00:01:52,277
so we have to make sure
it's all in the ground safe and sound.

21
00:01:52,362 --> 00:01:55,196
Aw, come on, Pincu and Radu.

22
00:01:55,824 --> 00:01:58,567
Think how warm it'll be in the barn.
We'll get this yoke off your neck.

23
00:01:58,577 --> 00:02:00,159
I see.

24
00:02:00,203 --> 00:02:02,490
Boys, if we don't get
what little we have planted,

25
00:02:03,123 --> 00:02:04,489
we'll have to eat you.

26
00:02:24,144 --> 00:02:25,351
Ma?

27
00:02:50,587 --> 00:02:52,749
Oh, no!

28
00:03:27,416 --> 00:03:29,078
This makes six raids.

29
00:03:29,501 --> 00:03:30,992
Done with this, then.

30
00:03:31,044 --> 00:03:32,910
Time to scatter.

31
00:03:32,963 --> 00:03:34,204
I'll go north.

32
00:03:35,257 --> 00:03:36,373
I'll recruit.

33
00:03:37,008 --> 00:03:39,546
And I'll go west, with my pack.

34
00:03:39,553 --> 00:03:42,842
And I'll go south to the desert
to make ready our den.

35
00:03:43,265 --> 00:03:44,597
That leaves east to me.

36
00:03:45,559 --> 00:03:47,551
Time to boil new poisons.

37
00:03:48,103 --> 00:03:50,891
And in a week, we gather to attack again.

38
00:05:44,511 --> 00:05:45,672
The king!

39
00:05:45,679 --> 00:05:47,479
- The king is coming!
- It's the king!

40
00:05:57,899 --> 00:06:00,186
There's the king. King Razvan.

41
00:06:06,825 --> 00:06:08,066
King Razvan!

42
00:06:11,121 --> 00:06:13,989
Make way. Make way for the king.

43
00:06:16,042 --> 00:06:17,658
Delicious. Thank you.

44
00:06:17,794 --> 00:06:20,036
Your Majesty?
Whispers of famine are everywhere.

45
00:06:20,171 --> 00:06:22,083
We're counting on your leadership.

46
00:06:22,215 --> 00:06:24,207
Open the treasury.
Implement an irrigation plan...

47
00:06:24,217 --> 00:06:26,300
We have marauders in the countryside.

48
00:06:26,428 --> 00:06:27,794
I must give that priority.

49
00:06:27,929 --> 00:06:30,137
But I will take your concerns to heart.

50
00:06:30,265 --> 00:06:31,265
Your Grace.

51
00:06:31,766 --> 00:06:33,098
Good day to you.

52
00:06:33,143 --> 00:06:36,602
My king, my children are starving.
The fields are empty.

53
00:06:39,482 --> 00:06:44,443
Take this crop seed from the royal stores,
for as you suffer, so do I.

54
00:06:44,613 --> 00:06:45,649
Oh, thank you.

55
00:06:56,249 --> 00:06:58,707
Your Majesty!
I need to speak with the king.

56
00:06:58,752 --> 00:07:00,032
The audience of appeals is over.

57
00:07:00,086 --> 00:07:02,544
I'm not asking for favors.
I wish to claim an offense.

58
00:07:02,589 --> 00:07:05,627
Four vicious murderers and their gang
are raiding the countryside.

59
00:07:05,675 --> 00:07:07,758
The king brings all outlaws to justice.

60
00:07:08,303 --> 00:07:10,044
- Eventually.
- Eventually is too long.

61
00:07:10,096 --> 00:07:12,679
- They've sacked six villages!
- I said stay back!

62
00:07:13,141 --> 00:07:14,723
They killed my family!

63
00:07:15,310 --> 00:07:18,394
They burned our house down,
and I wish to have revenge.

64
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:20,847
Then find a beer hall
and hire a sellsword.

65
00:07:20,899 --> 00:07:23,983
Now, unless you want to go to jail,
get lost!

66
00:07:25,028 --> 00:07:28,237
Impossible.
I have a great sense of direction.

67
00:07:34,245 --> 00:07:36,202
You just gonna admire yourself all day?

68
00:07:36,873 --> 00:07:37,873
Oh, yeah, um...

69
00:07:38,416 --> 00:07:39,873
Thing is, I just want them all.

70
00:07:46,007 --> 00:07:47,007
All right, boys.

71
00:07:47,801 --> 00:07:48,917
I'll miss you.

72
00:07:50,095 --> 00:07:51,375
At least you'll have each other.

73
00:07:52,138 --> 00:07:54,346
All right. Here's your ducats.

74
00:07:54,391 --> 00:07:55,472
Thank you.

75
00:07:55,934 --> 00:07:58,142
You don't happen to know
where the beer hall is, do you?

76
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:03,521
Yes.

77
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:05,892
- Hello. How are you?
- Hello.

78
00:08:06,069 --> 00:08:07,797
- I like your blouse. Is it new?
- Oh, thank you.

79
00:08:07,821 --> 00:08:09,357
It's pretty. It's really lovely.

80
00:08:09,364 --> 00:08:10,900
- See you.
- Bye.

81
00:08:14,411 --> 00:08:17,449
- Excuse me? Do you have wolfsbane?
- No, I don't have any.

82
00:08:17,455 --> 00:08:19,117
- No wolfsbane?
- I'm sorry.

83
00:08:19,249 --> 00:08:21,249
- No licorice root?
- Got willow bark.

84
00:08:22,335 --> 00:08:24,622
- How can I make pain reliever?
- Poppy heads.

85
00:08:24,713 --> 00:08:25,920
Will it cure the autumn cough?

86
00:08:26,047 --> 00:08:27,959
- Hello, young sir?
- Oh, sorry.

87
00:08:28,466 --> 00:08:29,957
How... How much for the plums?

88
00:08:38,309 --> 00:08:40,426
Mm. Delicious, yeah. Mm.

89
00:08:43,398 --> 00:08:45,640
- Oana!
- Coming, Father.

90
00:08:50,989 --> 00:08:52,105
Oana.

91
00:09:10,925 --> 00:09:13,633
Um... excuse me?

92
00:09:15,722 --> 00:09:17,304
I wish to hire a hunter.

93
00:09:18,892 --> 00:09:20,884
Nothing but drunks in here
who'll rob you blind.

94
00:09:20,935 --> 00:09:23,055
Now, if it's a hunter you need,
I'm the best there is.

95
00:09:23,146 --> 00:09:25,012
Name's Darius. Hmm.

96
00:09:28,568 --> 00:09:29,649
I need a hunter of men.

97
00:09:29,694 --> 00:09:32,858
Yeah, I know. You seek the four killers
who've been raiding the countryside.

98
00:09:34,783 --> 00:09:36,274
How many swords are in your company?

99
00:09:36,326 --> 00:09:37,862
One. I work alone.

100
00:09:37,952 --> 00:09:40,285
Well, I wish to pay for a manhunt,
not a funeral.

101
00:09:40,330 --> 00:09:43,494
Orphans and weeping widows have been
passing through here for a fortnight

102
00:09:43,541 --> 00:09:45,203
all because of these savages,

103
00:09:45,251 --> 00:09:48,039
but I've been waiting for someone
who wants to do something about it.

104
00:09:48,505 --> 00:09:51,839
So stop wasting time,
hire me, let's get hunting.

105
00:09:51,966 --> 00:09:53,332
Hey! Flower boy!

106
00:09:54,552 --> 00:09:56,259
Are you trying to steal our hire?

107
00:09:56,846 --> 00:10:00,135
Igor, lovely to see you.
How do you figure he's yours?

108
00:10:00,809 --> 00:10:02,266
Well, he's holding our ducats.

109
00:10:02,393 --> 00:10:03,393
Your ducats.

110
00:10:03,937 --> 00:10:05,724
Now, you want to rent blades.

111
00:10:06,523 --> 00:10:08,685
We're four for the price of his one.

112
00:10:08,775 --> 00:10:09,811
Aye.

113
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:11,942
Well, that is a better deal.

114
00:10:11,986 --> 00:10:14,979
And we don't come with as much crazy
baked in the pudding.

115
00:10:15,115 --> 00:10:18,199
Look, if something seems
too good to be true, it usually is.

116
00:10:18,326 --> 00:10:19,326
Hey!

117
00:10:20,370 --> 00:10:22,908
Too late. Offer's up.

118
00:10:23,331 --> 00:10:25,869
But this should cover our consultation.

119
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:27,960
Cheers.

120
00:10:32,006 --> 00:10:34,248
Sorry. I was aiming for the other hand.

121
00:10:34,634 --> 00:10:35,634
Kill him!

122
00:11:26,186 --> 00:11:27,848
Guess you do wanna go to jail.

123
00:11:33,943 --> 00:11:35,024
You owe me a hand!

124
00:11:43,203 --> 00:11:44,865
You two, arrest them. Arrest them all.

125
00:11:44,871 --> 00:11:46,612
You, up there!

126
00:11:50,293 --> 00:11:51,784
Ow! My God!

127
00:12:29,624 --> 00:12:31,832
All right, all right, I'm coming!

128
00:12:35,463 --> 00:12:37,546
- Come on!
- Hold your horses!

129
00:12:41,803 --> 00:12:43,419
Ah, yes.

130
00:12:43,429 --> 00:12:45,282
- Do you have the shoes?
- All finished.

131
00:12:45,306 --> 00:12:47,660
- Very good. Let's see them.
- I got them right here.

132
00:12:47,684 --> 00:12:49,164
All right, let's have a look.

133
00:12:49,435 --> 00:12:51,176
There they are, gentlemen.

134
00:12:51,187 --> 00:12:52,303
Come again soon.

135
00:12:52,313 --> 00:12:54,270
Very nice. I'll pay you next week.

136
00:12:54,315 --> 00:12:56,293
- They do look good, you know?
- Right.

137
00:13:01,656 --> 00:13:02,656
Good day, sir.

138
00:13:03,241 --> 00:13:05,198
Hell's fire!

139
00:13:05,660 --> 00:13:06,741
Where did you come from?

140
00:13:07,287 --> 00:13:09,279
I have an opportunity that I think...

141
00:13:09,289 --> 00:13:11,952
I sell things in this shop. I don't buy.

142
00:13:13,001 --> 00:13:15,368
No, no, I wish...
I wish to purchase one of your swords.

143
00:13:15,670 --> 00:13:18,333
See, I'm out to avenge the death
of my mother and father

144
00:13:18,423 --> 00:13:20,526
and after seeing the crooked sellswords
this town has to offer...

145
00:13:20,550 --> 00:13:22,212
Swords are six ducats.

146
00:13:22,218 --> 00:13:24,551
Well, I find myself lacking ducats.

147
00:13:24,554 --> 00:13:27,547
But what I do have is land.
Four hectares by the river.

148
00:13:27,598 --> 00:13:29,464
You barely got hair on your chin.

149
00:13:31,853 --> 00:13:34,561
- Do we have a deal?
- All you got is your word.

150
00:13:35,982 --> 00:13:37,689
And that don't mean much.

151
00:13:38,860 --> 00:13:40,726
It might mean a thing to those farmers.

152
00:13:40,862 --> 00:13:43,229
You're mixing scrap with your forge iron.

153
00:13:43,740 --> 00:13:45,759
Those horseshoes will break
a week sooner than normal.

154
00:13:45,783 --> 00:13:47,866
And you'll have them back needing more.

155
00:13:47,952 --> 00:13:49,534
Word of that can ruin a business.

156
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,411
So, what will it be?

157
00:13:55,418 --> 00:13:57,410
My word for your sword?
Or my word to your customers?

158
00:13:57,420 --> 00:13:59,412
You're blackmailing me.

159
00:13:59,422 --> 00:14:01,835
I'm bargaining with you.
I'm offering you something of value...

160
00:14:01,841 --> 00:14:05,380
Just... stop talking.

161
00:14:09,182 --> 00:14:10,389
This one.

162
00:14:13,269 --> 00:14:14,269
Here.

163
00:14:18,441 --> 00:14:20,228
Don't do this alone, son.

164
00:14:20,693 --> 00:14:22,525
- Get help.
- I've tried.

165
00:14:23,446 --> 00:14:24,732
None was forthcoming.

166
00:14:25,782 --> 00:14:27,944
Well, maybe it could help you.

167
00:14:30,536 --> 00:14:31,652
The dragon.

168
00:14:32,622 --> 00:14:35,865
It's been known to do a favor
if you take it something it desires.

169
00:14:39,253 --> 00:14:41,085
- It's real?
- Aye.

170
00:14:43,091 --> 00:14:45,458
But don't you go crowing
about any bargain with it.

171
00:14:45,551 --> 00:14:47,087
It betrayed your king.

172
00:14:47,095 --> 00:14:50,088
Still, dire problems need dire solutions.

173
00:14:50,765 --> 00:14:53,007
Well, if I had a dragon,
they wouldn't stand a chance.

174
00:14:54,644 --> 00:14:56,260
So, what does it desire?

175
00:14:56,938 --> 00:14:58,930
They paid with a bag of crop seed.

176
00:15:00,233 --> 00:15:01,314
Thank you.

177
00:15:02,193 --> 00:15:03,354
It's nice to make a friend.

178
00:15:03,403 --> 00:15:05,269
You're not my friend.

179
00:15:06,739 --> 00:15:08,071
You're my investment.

180
00:15:10,326 --> 00:15:12,318
- And I will pay off.
- Mm.

181
00:15:14,747 --> 00:15:15,783
Can I have one of these?

182
00:15:18,376 --> 00:15:20,242
Right. Here.

183
00:15:23,381 --> 00:15:25,901
Yeah, well, this one's all old and worn.
Can I have another one?

184
00:15:26,134 --> 00:15:30,219
Uh, how about... I'll give you
another hole in your head.

185
00:15:30,221 --> 00:15:31,632
Get out of here!

186
00:15:37,145 --> 00:15:38,431
Crop seed, huh?

187
00:15:53,327 --> 00:15:55,239
Excuse me. Excuse me. Hi.

188
00:15:55,288 --> 00:15:57,871
Um, do you, by any chance,
know where I can find the dragon...

189
00:15:57,874 --> 00:16:00,116
- I got no business with no dragons.
- Stay off with you!

190
00:16:00,126 --> 00:16:01,867
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Ah! Ah!

191
00:16:01,878 --> 00:16:03,289
Jeez, what's wrong with you people?

192
00:16:04,130 --> 00:16:07,339
Excuse me?
Do you know where I can find a dragon?

193
00:16:07,383 --> 00:16:08,743
Away with you!

194
00:16:23,232 --> 00:16:25,940
- That way.
- Thank you so much. Thank you.

195
00:16:36,871 --> 00:16:37,987
You better be worth it.

196
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:42,116
You better actually exist.

197
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:12,047
Dragon, come out.

198
00:18:28,858 --> 00:18:29,974
Hey, give that back!

199
00:19:09,357 --> 00:19:10,893
I was told you help people.

200
00:19:13,402 --> 00:19:14,438
Sometimes.

201
00:19:17,823 --> 00:19:20,110
I need you to help me track four killers.

202
00:19:20,159 --> 00:19:23,903
They burned my house,
killed my family and others.

203
00:19:26,415 --> 00:19:27,496
Will you help me?

204
00:19:30,670 --> 00:19:33,629
Find them? Or kill them?

205
00:19:37,843 --> 00:19:39,835
So, you're a girl dragon?

206
00:19:39,887 --> 00:19:42,550
Girl? You see me wearing a frock?

207
00:19:42,598 --> 00:19:45,432
No, sorry. I meant female.

208
00:19:45,810 --> 00:19:46,846
Hmm.

209
00:19:47,478 --> 00:19:48,764
Look, maybe I've made a mistake.

210
00:19:48,813 --> 00:19:51,601
It's just this job requires
a certain amount of savagery

211
00:19:51,649 --> 00:19:53,561
and it might not be suited
to the fairer sex.

212
00:19:57,988 --> 00:20:00,651
You obviously haven't spent
enough time around us.

213
00:20:03,577 --> 00:20:05,569
I take it back. I take it back.

214
00:20:11,168 --> 00:20:12,249
Ugh.

215
00:20:13,337 --> 00:20:18,298
Humans. High and mighty.
Screaming for salvation. Hmm?

216
00:20:18,718 --> 00:20:20,710
Even you don't follow your own advice.

217
00:20:20,761 --> 00:20:22,343
- I beg your pardon?
- What?

218
00:20:24,724 --> 00:20:26,966
- You were talking to yourself.
- No, I wasn't.

219
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:28,596
Was I?

220
00:20:28,644 --> 00:20:30,351
You just did it again.

221
00:20:30,396 --> 00:20:33,685
Oh.
Well, who else is there to talk to?

222
00:20:34,650 --> 00:20:35,857
Would you mind?

223
00:20:38,112 --> 00:20:40,274
I wouldn't have eaten you anyway.

224
00:20:40,322 --> 00:20:42,154
I swore off meat years ago.

225
00:20:42,825 --> 00:20:46,944
People used to bring
all kinds of valuables in trade.

226
00:20:46,996 --> 00:20:48,828
And then I switched them to food.

227
00:20:48,873 --> 00:20:52,457
Now they keep me supplied with
a wholesome roughage diet of crop seed.

228
00:20:52,877 --> 00:20:53,993
Mrs. Dragon?

229
00:20:54,044 --> 00:20:57,208
Siveth. My name is Siveth.

230
00:20:57,757 --> 00:20:59,714
It's been years since it was spoken.

231
00:20:59,759 --> 00:21:00,920
Well, my name's Lukas.

232
00:21:03,095 --> 00:21:05,257
- So, do we have a deal?
- No.

233
00:21:05,306 --> 00:21:06,342
What?

234
00:21:06,390 --> 00:21:09,178
Is he hard of hearing?
Hmm. Maybe he's the runt.

235
00:21:09,226 --> 00:21:10,342
But why not?

236
00:21:10,853 --> 00:21:16,190
Revenge will undo you,
draw you into danger. You'll die.

237
00:21:16,233 --> 00:21:17,349
Go back to farming.

238
00:21:17,985 --> 00:21:19,897
And just accept
what happened to my family?

239
00:21:19,945 --> 00:21:24,440
Sometimes accepting fate
is the only choice.

240
00:21:26,535 --> 00:21:27,867
Choke on it.

241
00:21:27,912 --> 00:21:30,074
I don't need your help. I'll do it myself.

242
00:21:30,122 --> 00:21:32,535
If it takes me a lifetime,
I'll do it myself.

243
00:21:35,044 --> 00:21:36,535
Not again.

244
00:21:37,463 --> 00:21:38,954
Not again.

245
00:22:12,665 --> 00:22:14,406
What? Ah!

246
00:22:16,877 --> 00:22:18,084
Hey there.

247
00:22:20,005 --> 00:22:21,246
Where'd you come from?

248
00:22:23,717 --> 00:22:25,208
All right, gorgeous. Hello.

249
00:22:37,565 --> 00:22:39,101
Maybe luck's turning my way.

250
00:22:43,362 --> 00:22:46,321
Whoa.

251
00:22:55,749 --> 00:22:56,865
Want some water?

252
00:23:00,337 --> 00:23:01,337
Suit yourself.

253
00:23:17,646 --> 00:23:18,978
Yaah!

254
00:23:20,441 --> 00:23:24,276
You should see your face.

255
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:28,530
You look like a sheep
when he sees the butcher coming.

256
00:23:28,532 --> 00:23:29,739
Oh, my God!

257
00:23:29,867 --> 00:23:32,575
I'm sorry. I've been there an hour.

258
00:23:32,578 --> 00:23:33,989
Oh, it was worth it.

259
00:23:33,996 --> 00:23:36,955
Oh, God.

260
00:23:36,957 --> 00:23:38,289
Oh, God.

261
00:23:38,876 --> 00:23:40,538
Come here. Come here. Boo!

262
00:23:40,544 --> 00:23:42,706
- Ah!
- Oh, it's all right.

263
00:23:45,674 --> 00:23:47,836
Come on, my friend. Go for a little walk.

264
00:23:49,803 --> 00:23:52,887
Why aren't you in jail? Eh?
How did you escape the King's Guard?

265
00:23:52,890 --> 00:23:56,804
Oh, you know, swordsmanship,
intimidation, cunning.

266
00:23:57,978 --> 00:23:59,389
I hid in a barrel.

267
00:23:59,396 --> 00:24:02,264
But I did manage to save this.

268
00:24:02,274 --> 00:24:03,310
Oh.

269
00:24:05,527 --> 00:24:06,938
Then I hunted you down.

270
00:24:06,987 --> 00:24:08,023
- Yeah?
- Yup.

271
00:24:08,072 --> 00:24:10,314
- And how did you find me?
- A little bird told me.

272
00:24:10,449 --> 00:24:12,816
No, really, how did you...
how did you find me?

273
00:24:12,868 --> 00:24:13,984
Bird told me.

274
00:24:13,994 --> 00:24:15,201
Hawk, specifically.

275
00:24:15,204 --> 00:24:16,695
Look, if you've just come here
to taunt me and...

276
00:24:16,705 --> 00:24:19,072
Do you still wanna hire someone
to find those heathens

277
00:24:19,083 --> 00:24:20,665
and give them what's coming?

278
00:24:20,751 --> 00:24:22,367
- Yeah.
- Great. I accept.

279
00:24:22,962 --> 00:24:24,794
- Hang on. There's 12 ducats in there.
- Yeah.

280
00:24:24,838 --> 00:24:27,080
A sellsword only costs seven,
according to the going rate.

281
00:24:27,091 --> 00:24:28,673
Yeah, but I'm worth 12.

282
00:24:28,717 --> 00:24:30,959
Plus, I appear to be
the only choice you have right now.

283
00:24:31,470 --> 00:24:32,927
Okay. Eight, then.

284
00:24:32,930 --> 00:24:35,092
And you get a ducat bonus
for every man we catch.

285
00:24:35,099 --> 00:24:36,681
That makes 12, if you do your job.

286
00:24:37,810 --> 00:24:38,891
Deal. I'll just...

287
00:24:39,478 --> 00:24:41,219
I'll hold onto it for safekeeping.

288
00:24:41,772 --> 00:24:42,853
Hold this.

289
00:24:43,399 --> 00:24:45,436
Come on,
let's check your saddle for travel.

290
00:24:45,484 --> 00:24:47,396
Ah. This could be lighter.

291
00:24:48,904 --> 00:24:49,904
Oi.

292
00:24:52,282 --> 00:24:54,740
- Hey! Hey!
- It's just gonna weigh you down.

293
00:24:56,495 --> 00:24:57,952
This belonged to my mother.

294
00:24:59,039 --> 00:25:00,905
Yeah, well, it's got no place
on a manhunt.

295
00:25:03,043 --> 00:25:04,159
Idiot.

296
00:25:05,004 --> 00:25:06,495
I'm making it easier on you.

297
00:25:07,172 --> 00:25:08,959
- They were splitting up.
- Right.

298
00:25:09,008 --> 00:25:10,089
One in each direction.

299
00:25:10,175 --> 00:25:13,839
<i>The one in the bear fur,
he said he was going north to recruit.</i>

300
00:25:15,097 --> 00:25:19,011
Right. Now, each one of these monsters
has a dangerous reputation.

301
00:25:19,143 --> 00:25:21,510
Our best bet is hitting them
while they're separated, okay?

302
00:25:21,645 --> 00:25:25,184
That's Castle Raznov, your farm, and us.

303
00:25:25,691 --> 00:25:27,651
We're already north a ways,
so we just keep going.

304
00:25:27,693 --> 00:25:30,982
Now, the big one, the Bear,
if he is recruiting,

305
00:25:30,988 --> 00:25:33,605
he's gonna be headed to the Broken Lands.

306
00:25:35,492 --> 00:25:37,575
And?

307
00:25:37,578 --> 00:25:38,739
Barbarians.

308
00:25:39,163 --> 00:25:41,450
- You ever met one?
- No.

309
00:25:41,457 --> 00:25:43,790
Of course not.
Your face is still attached to your skull.

310
00:25:45,335 --> 00:25:46,335
All right, then.

311
00:25:47,796 --> 00:25:49,003
The Bear.

312
00:25:49,631 --> 00:25:52,248
With any luck,
we find him before he recruits a mob.

313
00:25:53,969 --> 00:25:56,052
She turned you down, didn't she?

314
00:25:57,264 --> 00:26:00,132
- Doesn't surprise me.
- What do you know of the dragon?

315
00:26:00,225 --> 00:26:02,091
Well, years ago, when I was just a kid...

316
00:26:02,978 --> 00:26:05,470
<i>we were run off the road
by a speeding wagon.</i>

317
00:26:05,522 --> 00:26:06,854
<i>Our cart flipped.</i>

318
00:26:06,982 --> 00:26:10,726
<i>My parents died...
but I survived.</i>

319
00:26:11,695 --> 00:26:12,981
When I was old enough,

320
00:26:13,739 --> 00:26:16,356
I sought out the dragon
to help me find the man responsible,

321
00:26:16,366 --> 00:26:18,107
but the wretched creature refused.

322
00:26:20,370 --> 00:26:23,050
- This horse has a mind of its own.
- All right, let me talk to her.

323
00:26:23,082 --> 00:26:24,082
What's wrong?

324
00:26:25,084 --> 00:26:27,246
Why? What's wrong? You ill?

325
00:26:27,252 --> 00:26:28,368
Thrown a shoe?

326
00:26:32,091 --> 00:26:33,548
You can tell me anything at all.

327
00:26:35,886 --> 00:26:36,946
Well, that's why it ran off.

328
00:26:36,970 --> 00:26:38,907
There's not a thought in its head.
It's completely daft.

329
00:26:38,931 --> 00:26:41,048
Says the man talking to a horse.

330
00:26:42,267 --> 00:26:43,428
Anyway, the dragon.

331
00:26:43,477 --> 00:26:45,890
If she'd helped me, I would've found
my One-Eyed Man, but I never did,

332
00:26:45,896 --> 00:26:48,013
so now I sell my sword to others

333
00:26:48,023 --> 00:26:50,766
so that someone like you
never has to tell the same story.

334
00:26:52,111 --> 00:26:53,477
Well, she did, almost.

335
00:26:53,487 --> 00:26:54,694
Shh. Shh.

336
00:26:55,823 --> 00:26:56,904
What?

337
00:26:59,284 --> 00:27:00,320
The view.

338
00:27:02,121 --> 00:27:03,202
Gorgeous.

339
00:27:10,254 --> 00:27:12,541
Let's go.

340
00:27:22,182 --> 00:27:23,798
The Broken Lands.

341
00:27:28,438 --> 00:27:30,145
All right, stop here.

342
00:27:31,859 --> 00:27:33,145
Let's get it done.

343
00:27:33,902 --> 00:27:35,313
Get what done?

344
00:27:37,447 --> 00:27:40,690
Fact, we are gonna teach you
to use that sword

345
00:27:41,493 --> 00:27:43,359
so you don't cut your own fingers off.

346
00:27:43,495 --> 00:27:44,827
I hired you to fight.

347
00:27:44,830 --> 00:27:46,224
There's no shame in looking awkward.

348
00:27:46,248 --> 00:27:48,114
- Your girlfriend's not watching.
- Girlfriend?

349
00:27:48,125 --> 00:27:50,959
That pretty chestnut in the market.
I saw you stalking her.

350
00:27:50,961 --> 00:27:52,827
Her name's Oana, and I didn't stalk her.

351
00:27:52,963 --> 00:27:54,107
You stalked. It was pretty creepy.

352
00:27:54,131 --> 00:27:55,417
Now, draw your blade.

353
00:27:56,049 --> 00:27:57,881
- Ow!
- Too slow. Again.

354
00:27:59,094 --> 00:28:00,460
- Stop it.
- You gotta be faster.

355
00:28:00,470 --> 00:28:02,532
You might have to defend yourself
for real one of these days.

356
00:28:02,556 --> 00:28:03,922
Now, move your feet.

357
00:28:05,225 --> 00:28:07,387
Good. Positioning is paramount.

358
00:28:07,394 --> 00:28:09,056
Now, attack.

359
00:28:11,815 --> 00:28:12,976
You stabbed.

360
00:28:12,983 --> 00:28:14,099
Slash.

361
00:28:16,862 --> 00:28:20,230
- You said, "Slash."
- Yeah, but you over-slashed.

362
00:28:20,324 --> 00:28:22,657
Slash less. Like this.

363
00:28:31,084 --> 00:28:32,996
Good. Very good.

364
00:28:33,170 --> 00:28:34,661
You're still over-slashing.

365
00:28:34,671 --> 00:28:36,082
It needs to feel a little more...

366
00:28:46,350 --> 00:28:47,431
What?

367
00:28:48,602 --> 00:28:49,638
Huh.

368
00:28:52,606 --> 00:28:53,722
This is serious.

369
00:28:56,902 --> 00:28:59,690
Excellent. Thanks, boys.

370
00:29:03,700 --> 00:29:05,066
Right.

371
00:29:05,077 --> 00:29:08,866
They came through this way heading north.
They're gonna come back this way as well.

372
00:29:08,872 --> 00:29:13,367
We'll ambush them from... up there.

373
00:29:13,502 --> 00:29:15,539
Oh. Sorry. Sorry, guys.

374
00:29:17,381 --> 00:29:19,794
And did the worms say
when they'd be coming?

375
00:29:19,841 --> 00:29:22,299
No. Worms aren't as chatty as birds.

376
00:29:22,302 --> 00:29:23,713
Come on.

377
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:25,302
Bring your crazy horse with you.

378
00:29:26,181 --> 00:29:29,049
Just work with me, please. Please.

379
00:29:31,436 --> 00:29:34,304
So, what do we do if a hundred of them
come down that gully?

380
00:29:35,148 --> 00:29:36,889
Well, we're only after the Bear.

381
00:29:36,900 --> 00:29:39,688
We just need one good, clean shot.

382
00:29:40,279 --> 00:29:42,817
Right. And when the rest come after us?

383
00:29:43,740 --> 00:29:44,776
We run.

384
00:29:46,535 --> 00:29:47,651
Right.

385
00:29:48,704 --> 00:29:51,162
- So, we wait where the worms told us.
- Yup.

386
00:29:51,164 --> 00:29:53,577
Then we piss off
a superior number of barbarians

387
00:29:53,583 --> 00:29:55,700
and then try and outrun them
on their home turf.

388
00:29:56,378 --> 00:29:58,040
- You make it sound silly.
- Yeah, it is.

389
00:29:58,588 --> 00:30:00,045
And for all we know,
while we're lying here,

390
00:30:00,048 --> 00:30:02,165
they could be off raiding another village.

391
00:30:02,175 --> 00:30:03,882
I'm not paying you to sit on your a...

392
00:30:04,594 --> 00:30:07,428
Don't tell an expert how to do his job.

393
00:30:07,514 --> 00:30:09,471
No one else was willing, were they?

394
00:30:09,516 --> 00:30:12,509
Not those drunks,
and not that traitorous dragon.

395
00:30:14,104 --> 00:30:15,390
Don't you understand?

396
00:30:16,481 --> 00:30:18,347
I'm doing all this for you.

397
00:30:24,740 --> 00:30:26,072
Everyone calls her a traitor.

398
00:30:26,199 --> 00:30:27,199
She is a traitor.

399
00:30:28,243 --> 00:30:29,859
What did she do that was so bad?

400
00:30:33,415 --> 00:30:34,906
It was before you were born.

401
00:30:41,048 --> 00:30:42,539
Border wars were raging.

402
00:30:42,549 --> 00:30:46,213
Our kingdom was attacked
without provocation...

403
00:30:46,261 --> 00:30:48,173
<i>Our kingdom
had been unjustly attacked.</i>

404
00:30:48,221 --> 00:30:51,055
Have no fear! I will lead you!

405
00:30:51,433 --> 00:30:55,143
<i>King Razvan was keeping
people's spirits high to ensure victory.</i>

406
00:30:58,148 --> 00:30:59,389
<i>Then she appeared.</i>

407
00:31:00,525 --> 00:31:02,187
<i>Pledged to help us find peace.</i>

408
00:31:03,945 --> 00:31:06,153
<i>Soon after,
the king was wounded in battle.</i>

409
00:31:07,282 --> 00:31:08,614
<i>Gravely wounded.</i>

410
00:31:09,910 --> 00:31:11,492
Legends had crossed the seas

411
00:31:11,536 --> 00:31:14,279
that dragons could share
a piece of their heart

412
00:31:14,289 --> 00:31:17,657
<i>to save someone's life,
bonding their senses and pains forever.</i>

413
00:31:18,335 --> 00:31:21,919
<i>Although she pledged to help,
and he lay on the edge of death,</i>

414
00:31:22,005 --> 00:31:25,043
<i>she insisted that nature
must take its course.</i>

415
00:31:26,760 --> 00:31:27,876
<i>But the king survived.</i>

416
00:31:27,886 --> 00:31:33,473
In the kingdom's darkest moment,
as I lay bleeding for you, she refused us.

417
00:31:33,517 --> 00:31:35,304
Traitor!

418
00:31:35,352 --> 00:31:36,559
Traitor!

419
00:31:36,937 --> 00:31:38,519
Traitor!

420
00:31:39,314 --> 00:31:40,805
<i>People shunned her.</i>

421
00:31:41,817 --> 00:31:43,683
<i>She became the hermit she is today.</i>

422
00:31:53,245 --> 00:31:54,361
Oh, God!

423
00:31:55,122 --> 00:31:58,786
Oh! You... You... Stop! Stop it!

424
00:31:59,334 --> 00:32:02,122
Whoa, whoa, whoa! Dirty...

425
00:32:02,254 --> 00:32:05,042
Whoa, whoa! Whoa, whoa, whoa!

426
00:32:14,850 --> 00:32:17,263
"Whoa, whoa, whoa," yourself.

427
00:32:19,020 --> 00:32:20,886
I knew that horse was nuts.

428
00:32:23,525 --> 00:32:24,857
Dragons can change shape?

429
00:32:24,985 --> 00:32:28,023
Yes. Males disguise as rocks or water.

430
00:32:28,071 --> 00:32:30,563
We take the form of animals.

431
00:32:30,574 --> 00:32:33,032
Good thing too.
Otherwise, I wouldn't be here

432
00:32:33,076 --> 00:32:35,910
to keep that one
from filling your head with lies.

433
00:32:35,954 --> 00:32:37,445
I don't lie.

434
00:32:38,081 --> 00:32:40,073
Why didn't you say something
all this time?

435
00:32:40,083 --> 00:32:41,995
I can't speak in another form.

436
00:32:42,127 --> 00:32:45,291
And the change...
exhausts me. Watch.

437
00:32:47,007 --> 00:32:48,543
See?

438
00:32:49,384 --> 00:32:50,920
I'm even short of breath.

439
00:32:52,345 --> 00:32:54,132
Does this mean you're gonna help us now?

440
00:32:54,806 --> 00:32:57,093
Only wanted to make sure you weren't hurt.

441
00:32:58,935 --> 00:33:01,348
She's just easing her conscience.

442
00:33:01,480 --> 00:33:04,518
You can't trust someone
who hides who they really are.

443
00:33:04,566 --> 00:33:05,726
No, on the contrary.

444
00:33:05,775 --> 00:33:08,358
It shows I'm excellent
at keeping a secret.

445
00:33:08,528 --> 00:33:11,942
It wasn't easy suffering silently
through your nonsense.

446
00:33:11,948 --> 00:33:13,530
"I'm worth 12 ducats."

447
00:33:13,575 --> 00:33:14,941
"Hold the reigns tighter."

448
00:33:14,993 --> 00:33:16,109
"Move your feet."

449
00:33:16,161 --> 00:33:18,073
So bossy. And whiny.

450
00:33:18,121 --> 00:33:19,121
No, I'm being serious.

451
00:33:19,122 --> 00:33:20,725
We could all go
and find the Bear together.

452
00:33:20,749 --> 00:33:22,115
She won't help you.

453
00:33:22,292 --> 00:33:24,329
And the Bear is coming back
right through there.

454
00:33:24,377 --> 00:33:25,493
We are fine.

455
00:33:25,545 --> 00:33:26,831
I will help you

456
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:29,748
if you listen to my advice
when we find these men.

457
00:33:30,842 --> 00:33:31,878
I'm warning you.

458
00:33:32,385 --> 00:33:34,718
She will deny you the revenge you deserve.

459
00:33:36,765 --> 00:33:37,765
Deal. I'll listen.

460
00:33:38,391 --> 00:33:41,259
- Hmm.
- Deal? No. No deal.

461
00:33:41,269 --> 00:33:42,726
Work with her?

462
00:33:42,854 --> 00:33:45,471
Have everyone call me a dragon lover?

463
00:33:45,482 --> 00:33:46,723
- Oh, my.
- No, you have to choose.

464
00:33:46,733 --> 00:33:47,974
It's the traitor or me.

465
00:33:47,984 --> 00:33:50,897
Look, you'll still get your fee.
It's just we've got extra help now.

466
00:33:50,904 --> 00:33:51,940
Okay.

467
00:33:53,865 --> 00:33:55,401
Choose your champion, kid.

468
00:33:55,534 --> 00:33:57,275
Who would you rather have
standing by your side

469
00:33:57,285 --> 00:33:59,743
when a horde of barbarians
comes down that pathway?

470
00:33:59,788 --> 00:34:01,450
Hmm. Good question.

471
00:34:06,294 --> 00:34:07,294
Really?

472
00:34:07,837 --> 00:34:10,375
Maybe you and I should
put aside our differences...

473
00:34:10,382 --> 00:34:12,294
Forgive and regret!

474
00:34:12,300 --> 00:34:13,586
That's what I always say.

475
00:34:15,220 --> 00:34:16,301
I've warned you.

476
00:35:31,421 --> 00:35:33,037
Meat.

477
00:35:37,886 --> 00:35:38,922
S iveth!

478
00:35:40,930 --> 00:35:42,546
S iveth!

479
00:36:02,535 --> 00:36:04,822
- What are you doing?
- I'm saving you.

480
00:36:04,871 --> 00:36:06,203
Forget about me. Blast them!

481
00:36:06,247 --> 00:36:07,988
Can't yet.

482
00:36:08,041 --> 00:36:09,282
Well, eat them or something.

483
00:36:09,709 --> 00:36:11,792
Yuck. Disgusting.

484
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:13,877
The eyes! The eyes!

485
00:36:14,047 --> 00:36:15,458
Blind the beast!

486
00:36:24,974 --> 00:36:27,341
Attack! Attack!

487
00:36:41,366 --> 00:36:42,857
Lukas!

488
00:37:24,951 --> 00:37:26,533
We scared them off.

489
00:37:30,665 --> 00:37:34,875
Death is an ugly sight
no matter how deserved.

490
00:37:36,838 --> 00:37:39,706
Did you see that? That was incredible!

491
00:37:39,758 --> 00:37:41,670
Oh, he had me. I was a complete goner.

492
00:37:41,676 --> 00:37:44,589
But then my belt snapped
and he fell and he screamed.

493
00:37:44,971 --> 00:37:46,428
And then he smacked his head.

494
00:37:47,432 --> 00:37:48,673
One down, three to go.

495
00:37:49,517 --> 00:37:51,429
So, what do we do with him?

496
00:37:51,436 --> 00:37:53,928
That was the deal, right?
I listen to you once we snared one.

497
00:37:54,856 --> 00:37:56,722
Let's talk about it later.

498
00:37:57,942 --> 00:37:59,478
We'll go for the Wolf next.

499
00:38:01,404 --> 00:38:02,565
The one in the hood.

500
00:38:02,655 --> 00:38:04,817
<i>He said he was headed west
with his pack.</i>

501
00:38:04,824 --> 00:38:06,531
<i>I'll bet we could pick up
his trail.</i>

502
00:39:03,383 --> 00:39:05,375
We'd get there faster if we both flew.

503
00:39:05,385 --> 00:39:06,751
Walking is good for you.

504
00:39:06,761 --> 00:39:09,094
You're hoping I'll give up.
Aren't you?

505
00:39:09,097 --> 00:39:13,057
Oh. It feels so good to stretch my wings.

506
00:39:14,394 --> 00:39:16,727
What's it like? Flying?

507
00:39:16,729 --> 00:39:19,392
Mm.
Like nothing can hold you back.

508
00:39:19,399 --> 00:39:21,311
I mean, we could try it.

509
00:39:21,442 --> 00:39:23,399
Not for the whole journey, just for fun.

510
00:39:24,946 --> 00:39:27,233
Okay. We can fly.

511
00:39:27,532 --> 00:39:28,898
Truly?

512
00:39:29,033 --> 00:39:30,569
I know just the thing.

513
00:39:31,494 --> 00:39:33,611
We'll fly back to town, get a warm meal,

514
00:39:33,705 --> 00:39:36,573
might even be news
of these animals we're after.

515
00:39:38,334 --> 00:39:40,200
Yeah, on second thought,
we can't go to town.

516
00:39:41,504 --> 00:39:42,620
Everyone hates you.

517
00:39:43,715 --> 00:39:45,456
You do have a way with words.

518
00:39:49,012 --> 00:39:51,004
Why did you betray the king, anyway?

519
00:39:51,139 --> 00:39:52,596
Oh, it was a long time ago.

520
00:39:52,599 --> 00:39:57,310
What's more important
is I heard you talking of this, um, Oana?

521
00:39:57,312 --> 00:39:58,723
You could take her flowers.

522
00:39:58,730 --> 00:40:00,687
Girls find flowers intriguing.

523
00:40:01,608 --> 00:40:03,315
Right, and how would you know?

524
00:40:03,318 --> 00:40:05,004
You've made it very clear
you're not a girl.

525
00:40:05,028 --> 00:40:06,189
But I am female.

526
00:40:06,321 --> 00:40:10,440
And we pay more attention
to beauty of all kinds.

527
00:40:10,450 --> 00:40:11,782
No, we're not done here.

528
00:40:12,994 --> 00:40:15,862
I understand if you don't wanna tell me
what happened with the king.

529
00:40:16,497 --> 00:40:18,659
We've all done stuff
we'd rather not remember.

530
00:40:19,500 --> 00:40:22,743
What we remember or forget
matters not.

531
00:40:22,879 --> 00:40:26,543
What you do with your life
is the most important thing.

532
00:40:27,091 --> 00:40:28,377
Look around you.

533
00:40:29,177 --> 00:40:31,294
Life is for living.

534
00:40:32,138 --> 00:40:34,972
Live for life, not death.

535
00:40:36,517 --> 00:40:38,317
Yeah, I think I preferred you more
as a horse.

536
00:40:38,937 --> 00:40:41,020
And if you're gonna fly,
at least scout what's ahead.

537
00:40:44,943 --> 00:40:46,229
Forest.

538
00:40:46,235 --> 00:40:47,351
Three leagues off.

539
00:40:47,946 --> 00:40:49,357
Just the place to find a wolf.

540
00:40:53,993 --> 00:40:56,110
What's it like where you come from?

541
00:40:56,162 --> 00:40:57,323
Britannia?

542
00:40:57,372 --> 00:40:58,453
Mmm.

543
00:40:58,998 --> 00:41:00,705
Foggy, green.

544
00:41:01,376 --> 00:41:03,584
Farms as far as the eye can see.

545
00:41:06,214 --> 00:41:07,421
I loved our farm.

546
00:41:09,092 --> 00:41:10,503
My mother was so funny.

547
00:41:11,344 --> 00:41:13,301
My father was so clumsy.

548
00:41:13,346 --> 00:41:14,803
Ah, she'd give him grief.

549
00:41:15,348 --> 00:41:18,682
That man could not butter bread
without dropping it butter side down.

550
00:41:20,103 --> 00:41:21,264
They were dear to me.

551
00:41:23,690 --> 00:41:25,522
I know you think this hunt is a mistake.

552
00:41:26,859 --> 00:41:29,021
But haven't you ever wanted
to really punish someone

553
00:41:29,070 --> 00:41:30,481
for the wrongs they've done?

554
00:41:30,530 --> 00:41:33,068
Punishment
is nothing to long for.

555
00:41:33,741 --> 00:41:36,609
What I want is to live a noble life.

556
00:41:37,161 --> 00:41:41,576
And one day, ascend to the stars
among our kind.

557
00:41:42,583 --> 00:41:43,869
For eternity.

558
00:41:45,545 --> 00:41:47,753
Some laughs
along the way wouldn't hurt.

559
00:41:48,423 --> 00:41:49,755
Maybe a party.

560
00:41:50,216 --> 00:41:52,674
Mmm. Haven't had a party in years.

561
00:41:56,139 --> 00:41:57,471
I know you're in pain,

562
00:41:58,349 --> 00:42:02,263
but vengeance can darken
even the noblest heart.

563
00:42:19,162 --> 00:42:20,778
No, Lukas, where are you going?

564
00:42:21,789 --> 00:42:23,906
These little buggers
can't stand the cold.

565
00:42:32,050 --> 00:42:33,086
I'm coming!

566
00:42:38,806 --> 00:42:40,468
Lukas! Get down!

567
00:42:47,940 --> 00:42:49,556
Oh, oh, oh.

568
00:43:00,703 --> 00:43:03,036
Wolves don't like to be hunted.

569
00:43:07,376 --> 00:43:11,245
Thought you could sneak up on us, Dragon?
Well, you followed us far enough.

570
00:43:11,339 --> 00:43:16,300
Keep your distance,
and this little hostage lives.

571
00:43:36,364 --> 00:43:37,605
Be still.

572
00:43:42,036 --> 00:43:44,028
Not so tough without your pack, huh?

573
00:43:44,455 --> 00:43:45,946
You ready to join the Bear?

574
00:43:46,040 --> 00:43:47,531
Don't be so quick to kill.

575
00:43:48,668 --> 00:43:50,500
He's worth more to us alive.

576
00:43:53,172 --> 00:43:55,084
I can lead you to the others.

577
00:43:59,554 --> 00:44:01,170
You live, for now.

578
00:44:03,808 --> 00:44:05,219
Something funny to you?

579
00:44:22,702 --> 00:44:24,694
Is this where you all hole up together?

580
00:44:25,079 --> 00:44:27,571
- The Snake's den?
- Aye.

581
00:44:32,336 --> 00:44:34,168
I can take you there.

582
00:44:36,424 --> 00:44:38,290
- Why do you do it?
- Trees.

583
00:44:38,718 --> 00:44:40,050
Make my nose itch.

584
00:44:40,052 --> 00:44:41,384
No. Why do you kill people?

585
00:44:42,054 --> 00:44:43,795
Who've never done anything to you?

586
00:44:45,683 --> 00:44:48,471
That scar.
Someone hurt you so you hurt others?

587
00:44:49,312 --> 00:44:52,350
The man that took my scalp
didn't deserve such credit.

588
00:44:53,774 --> 00:44:58,235
He hurt me, my sister, my brother,
so I took his life,

589
00:44:58,362 --> 00:45:01,480
and it's still the best day
that I can remember.

590
00:45:02,116 --> 00:45:04,733
But the killing gets easier
as you get the hang of it.

591
00:45:06,078 --> 00:45:07,319
I'm not like you.

592
00:45:13,211 --> 00:45:15,011
Well, someone's home, that's for sure.

593
00:45:19,675 --> 00:45:20,711
Here's the plan.

594
00:45:20,760 --> 00:45:22,092
I'll circle above.

595
00:45:22,136 --> 00:45:23,877
The Wolf gets them to come outside.

596
00:45:24,055 --> 00:45:25,796
Well, what about me?
I'm not doing anything.

597
00:45:25,806 --> 00:45:28,344
You'll be our lookout. Up here.

598
00:45:28,351 --> 00:45:29,637
I wanna be down there.

599
00:45:31,729 --> 00:45:33,220
Who the devil is that?

600
00:45:35,149 --> 00:45:37,892
Hmm.
I should've known he'd follow us.

601
00:45:38,027 --> 00:45:39,268
Nosy meddler.

602
00:45:39,320 --> 00:45:40,401
What's he doing?

603
00:45:40,404 --> 00:45:42,942
He's getting himself killed
is what he's doing.

604
00:45:43,032 --> 00:45:45,024
- He's smoking them out.
- He's mad.

605
00:45:45,034 --> 00:45:46,275
Will you shut up?

606
00:45:49,997 --> 00:45:52,080
Hmm. It might work.

607
00:45:54,085 --> 00:45:56,042
Nah.

608
00:46:00,132 --> 00:46:01,464
He's lost his sword.

609
00:46:05,930 --> 00:46:06,930
That's her.

610
00:46:07,515 --> 00:46:08,881
That's the Snake.

611
00:46:11,644 --> 00:46:14,261
- Ah!
- Whoa!

612
00:46:15,523 --> 00:46:17,685
Hey!

613
00:46:23,239 --> 00:46:24,400
They're gonna kill him.

614
00:46:35,960 --> 00:46:36,996
Where were we?

615
00:46:44,260 --> 00:46:45,796
Get rid of the messages.

616
00:46:45,845 --> 00:46:46,845
Burn them!

617
00:47:00,192 --> 00:47:01,399
She's getting away.

618
00:47:02,028 --> 00:47:03,564
Hyah! Hyah!

619
00:47:54,038 --> 00:47:56,655
- I was fine!
- Uh-huh.

620
00:49:01,856 --> 00:49:03,097
What's going on?

621
00:49:04,650 --> 00:49:06,391
Can someone tell me what's going on?

622
00:49:16,704 --> 00:49:18,070
It's like I told you.

623
00:49:20,541 --> 00:49:23,454
<i>Border war drove my family
from our home.</i>

624
00:49:23,461 --> 00:49:24,747
<i>We took everything.</i>

625
00:49:26,005 --> 00:49:28,748
<i>The wagon came up behind us
and never stopped.</i>

626
00:49:36,849 --> 00:49:38,681
<i>It's how she found me.</i>

627
00:49:39,226 --> 00:49:41,092
<i>Gave me half of her heart.</i>

628
00:49:41,854 --> 00:49:43,686
Changing our lives forever.

629
00:49:49,778 --> 00:49:51,394
The traitor and I...

630
00:49:53,991 --> 00:49:55,277
<i>we're bonded.</i>

631
00:49:58,496 --> 00:50:01,739
<i>Neither the abbot nor I knew
how I got to the monastery.</i>

632
00:50:04,251 --> 00:50:06,243
<i>The monks buried my parents.</i>

633
00:50:07,630 --> 00:50:09,997
<i>Everyone assumed my wound
was from the crash.</i>

634
00:50:10,007 --> 00:50:12,420
<i>The only thing I remembered
was the One-Eyed Man.</i>

635
00:50:15,262 --> 00:50:17,094
<i>I learned to read and write.</i>

636
00:50:17,097 --> 00:50:18,429
<i>Life was simple.</i>

637
00:50:18,516 --> 00:50:22,886
<i>Until one day, I learned
to understand a new language.</i>

638
00:50:24,772 --> 00:50:27,936
<i>I felt the instincts
of the forest creatures in my blood.</i>

639
00:50:28,025 --> 00:50:30,768
Their calls and sounds made sense to me.

640
00:50:30,903 --> 00:50:33,145
A new world only I understood.

641
00:50:35,491 --> 00:50:40,111
<i>Then I woke seeing
through something else's eyes.</i>

642
00:50:42,915 --> 00:50:44,872
<i>I knew I was bound to another...</i>

643
00:50:46,293 --> 00:50:47,909
<i>that I had to find them.</i>

644
00:50:50,548 --> 00:50:54,132
<i>She explained to me
how she saved my life.</i>

645
00:50:55,261 --> 00:50:58,925
I asked for information
about the One-Eyed Man.

646
00:50:58,973 --> 00:51:01,465
<i>If she'd help me to find him
and get revenge.</i>

647
00:51:02,434 --> 00:51:04,221
You know her answer.

648
00:51:04,353 --> 00:51:07,596
You were so young.

649
00:51:37,052 --> 00:51:38,133
Hello there.

650
00:51:44,685 --> 00:51:46,893
She's got a cold heart, no?

651
00:51:48,772 --> 00:51:51,264
Hmm. This is nice.

652
00:51:51,692 --> 00:51:52,853
Look at that.

653
00:51:59,325 --> 00:52:00,941
What were you up to?

654
00:52:04,413 --> 00:52:05,779
Burning papers?

655
00:52:11,712 --> 00:52:12,793
Beg pardon.

656
00:52:23,557 --> 00:52:24,798
You ruined my plan.

657
00:52:25,351 --> 00:52:29,140
Hmm. The fall-through-the-roof plan?

658
00:52:29,938 --> 00:52:33,807
Yeah, and don't think
I haven't noticed you stealing my look.

659
00:52:33,942 --> 00:52:34,942
- Ow.
- Come here.

660
00:52:37,655 --> 00:52:41,274
Well, at least you're not yoked to her
like I am, like an ox.

661
00:52:42,242 --> 00:52:44,950
I don't know.
Sounds quite nice, sharing a heart.

662
00:52:44,995 --> 00:52:47,057
- Is he an ox?
- Feeling connected with something.

663
00:52:47,081 --> 00:52:48,121
Or are we the ox?

664
00:52:48,165 --> 00:52:50,282
Feeling two ways about everything
at the same time?

665
00:52:50,584 --> 00:52:52,896
I mean, one minute, I'm fine,
the next, I'm crying,

666
00:52:52,920 --> 00:52:56,504
I'm raging, I'm hungry,
I'm thirsty, I'm hot, I'm co...

667
00:52:57,758 --> 00:52:59,340
Yeah, great team you two make.

668
00:52:59,385 --> 00:53:01,468
Came for one quarry, lost the other.

669
00:53:03,055 --> 00:53:04,415
Yeah, what about the Wolf?

670
00:53:04,807 --> 00:53:05,968
Don't worry about him.

671
00:53:06,684 --> 00:53:08,300
I can always find him later.

672
00:53:09,144 --> 00:53:11,978
Why don't you go
and ask slither-face over there

673
00:53:12,064 --> 00:53:13,555
where the fourth one is?

674
00:53:17,945 --> 00:53:20,187
You said you were coming
to make the camp ready?

675
00:53:20,322 --> 00:53:22,109
Were you all meeting up?

676
00:53:25,285 --> 00:53:27,026
So the Scorpion's coming here?

677
00:53:28,872 --> 00:53:29,988
Lovely boy.

678
00:53:30,582 --> 00:53:32,949
You should've waited
till he showed himself.

679
00:53:33,043 --> 00:53:34,705
Now he'll sense you,

680
00:53:35,546 --> 00:53:38,129
hide under a rock until you least suspect.

681
00:53:39,049 --> 00:53:40,460
Then you'll lead us to him.

682
00:53:41,927 --> 00:53:44,840
All right, well,
if that's all she's got to say,

683
00:53:44,847 --> 00:53:46,383
you might as well get it done.

684
00:53:52,563 --> 00:53:57,308
Lukas, remember the part
about listening to me.

685
00:53:57,860 --> 00:53:59,442
Let's take her to town.

686
00:53:59,987 --> 00:54:01,103
She'll be put in jail.

687
00:54:01,196 --> 00:54:04,689
Kid, don't go a lifetime
regretting a missed opportunity.

688
00:54:04,783 --> 00:54:07,116
That snake murdered your parents.

689
00:54:07,119 --> 00:54:10,237
In town, she will face justice.

690
00:54:10,372 --> 00:54:11,829
You don't have to do this.

691
00:54:11,832 --> 00:54:13,368
Do it. For both of us.

692
00:54:13,375 --> 00:54:16,743
Ignore him.
He's so drunk even I'm seeing double.

693
00:54:16,754 --> 00:54:19,497
No. No, no.

694
00:54:19,631 --> 00:54:21,839
I've never shared sight with you
since that first time,

695
00:54:21,842 --> 00:54:24,175
and I will go to my grave
before I do it again.

696
00:54:25,429 --> 00:54:26,670
You know what?

697
00:54:26,722 --> 00:54:30,181
You should've just let me die,
because all this has done is reminded me

698
00:54:30,225 --> 00:54:33,059
that when I needed you most,
you failed me.

699
00:54:35,272 --> 00:54:36,558
Just like she'll fail you.

700
00:54:40,444 --> 00:54:41,525
Lukas, don't.

701
00:54:41,653 --> 00:54:42,653
Do it!

702
00:54:44,448 --> 00:54:45,655
You let this villain live,

703
00:54:45,657 --> 00:54:48,257
you'll be chasing your own One-Eyed Man
for the rest of your life.

704
00:54:48,994 --> 00:54:50,280
Do it!

705
00:54:51,163 --> 00:54:52,404
Do it!

706
00:55:01,882 --> 00:55:04,340
- There was no One-Eyed Man.
- What?

707
00:55:06,845 --> 00:55:08,256
It was the king.

708
00:55:12,684 --> 00:55:16,803
From the moment I came to your shores,
I didn't trust King Razvan.

709
00:55:20,818 --> 00:55:24,983
<i>The border war was taking a terrible toll,
yet the people called him hero.</i>

710
00:55:26,114 --> 00:55:28,197
<i>What choice did they have?</i>

711
00:55:28,200 --> 00:55:29,486
My subjects...

712
00:55:31,161 --> 00:55:34,404
<i>He lived more extravagantly
than anyone knew.</i>

713
00:55:36,291 --> 00:55:40,581
<i>I sent him requests
to pursue peace negotiations.</i>

714
00:55:41,338 --> 00:55:44,922
<i>The king took action in secrecy.</i>

715
00:55:44,967 --> 00:55:48,506
<i>I suspected he'd used agents
to start the war,</i>

716
00:55:48,554 --> 00:55:51,262
<i>to give him an excuse
to attack the enemy.</i>

717
00:55:54,893 --> 00:55:56,412
<i>But before
I could prove anything,</i>

718
00:55:56,436 --> 00:55:59,224
<i>he strayed too close to the battle.</i>

719
00:56:03,819 --> 00:56:09,315
<i>They were taking him to town
where they would expect me to save him.</i>

720
00:56:15,497 --> 00:56:16,737
Run them off the road!

721
00:56:17,958 --> 00:56:19,449
Run them off the road, I said!

722
00:56:23,046 --> 00:56:24,287
Help your king.

723
00:56:26,633 --> 00:56:28,795
Give it to me.

724
00:56:28,802 --> 00:56:29,838
Give it to me!

725
00:56:30,929 --> 00:56:33,592
Share your heart! It's your duty!

726
00:56:34,892 --> 00:56:38,181
<i>People wonder
why I refused the king.</i>

727
00:56:41,023 --> 00:56:44,812
<i>The truth is,
I had already shared my heart</i>

728
00:56:44,902 --> 00:56:47,565
<i>with someone more deserving
of life.</i>

729
00:56:48,906 --> 00:56:50,067
You.

730
00:56:51,074 --> 00:56:52,781
But the king survived.

731
00:56:52,826 --> 00:56:54,067
And in a fortnight,

732
00:56:54,244 --> 00:56:57,612
<i>he was before the people
branding me a traitor.</i>

733
00:56:57,623 --> 00:56:58,739
Shame on you!

734
00:56:58,749 --> 00:57:03,369
<i>I misjudged his popularity
and the fear that war breeds.</i>

735
00:57:03,420 --> 00:57:05,662
<i>I lost the people's trust.</i>

736
00:57:06,965 --> 00:57:09,252
You could have just attacked,
taken the king down.

737
00:57:09,301 --> 00:57:10,883
No one could stop a dragon.

738
00:57:10,886 --> 00:57:13,879
And force everyone to obey me?
Hmm.

739
00:57:13,889 --> 00:57:17,929
Once you replace trust with fear,
there is no going back.

740
00:57:19,353 --> 00:57:21,185
And the One-Eyed Man?

741
00:57:22,898 --> 00:57:27,438
The wagon they used that day,
it belonged to the enemy.

742
00:57:28,570 --> 00:57:31,233
<i>Their colors, their flag.</i>

743
00:57:33,241 --> 00:57:35,278
<i>That was your One-Eyed Man.</i>

744
00:57:37,955 --> 00:57:39,867
You said he was real.

745
00:57:42,459 --> 00:57:43,620
You lied to me.

746
00:57:44,586 --> 00:57:46,248
No, I protected you.

747
00:57:47,506 --> 00:57:50,374
If you had known the king was responsible,

748
00:57:50,425 --> 00:57:53,042
you'd have just gotten yourself killed.

749
00:57:58,558 --> 00:58:00,641
What more proof do you need?

750
00:58:00,686 --> 00:58:01,927
Do it!

751
00:59:02,456 --> 00:59:04,413
Alive and kicking. That's not like you.

752
00:59:04,416 --> 00:59:06,624
Yeah. I'm a changed man. Here.

753
00:59:13,759 --> 00:59:14,795
Oana!

754
00:59:22,267 --> 00:59:23,303
Oana!

755
00:59:26,229 --> 00:59:27,265
Coming, Father.

756
00:59:30,859 --> 00:59:32,270
Well done, Darius.

757
00:59:33,070 --> 00:59:34,311
- Thank you.
- Okay.

758
00:59:34,321 --> 00:59:36,688
There's something entirely
too civilized about all this.

759
00:59:40,243 --> 00:59:41,324
- Darius?
- Hmm?

760
00:59:41,411 --> 00:59:43,091
You followed us to the Snake's lair,
right?

761
00:59:43,705 --> 00:59:45,571
Followed you? No.

762
00:59:45,582 --> 00:59:50,122
No, I just thought your job...
deserved doing.

763
00:59:50,921 --> 00:59:52,833
Right. Well, I owe you thanks.

764
00:59:53,131 --> 00:59:54,463
- Ah.
- Three, actually.

765
00:59:54,466 --> 00:59:55,877
Whenever I really needed someone,

766
00:59:55,926 --> 00:59:59,260
at the lair, on the road, in the town,
you were there.

767
01:00:02,516 --> 01:00:04,883
You've got backbone. You deserve it.

768
01:00:23,120 --> 01:00:24,201
Oana?

769
01:00:24,871 --> 01:00:27,158
- Got my name right.
- Yeah. I...

770
01:00:27,249 --> 01:00:29,457
You're not trying
to sell me something, are you?

771
01:00:29,501 --> 01:00:30,912
- No! No, I...
- So, I was thinking...

772
01:00:30,919 --> 01:00:31,959
Scorpion.

773
01:00:32,087 --> 01:00:33,564
He's on his own now,
but he's still dangerous.

774
01:00:33,588 --> 01:00:35,066
How about we go out
early tomorrow morning...

775
01:00:35,090 --> 01:00:37,833
Oh, Siveth! Sorry. Siveth, stop it!

776
01:01:10,041 --> 01:01:11,373
Are you sure about this?

777
01:01:15,672 --> 01:01:17,504
Okay. Let's do this.

778
01:01:21,094 --> 01:01:22,756
This is never gonna work.

779
01:01:23,221 --> 01:01:24,883
Just repeat what I say.

780
01:01:24,931 --> 01:01:26,547
Have you ever actually wooed anyone?

781
01:01:27,058 --> 01:01:29,220
- Dragon or otherwise?
- Of course.

782
01:01:29,352 --> 01:01:30,559
When?

783
01:01:30,604 --> 01:01:32,266
You've been a hermit for 20 years.

784
01:01:32,314 --> 01:01:33,896
Some things you don't forget.

785
01:01:33,940 --> 01:01:34,940
Go!

786
01:01:36,985 --> 01:01:39,318
First, give her a compliment!

787
01:01:39,321 --> 01:01:40,607
No, his name.

788
01:01:40,614 --> 01:01:42,025
What? His name.
Oh, yes, his name.

789
01:01:42,073 --> 01:01:43,359
Would you two make up your mind?

790
01:01:43,408 --> 01:01:45,070
Compliment. Definitely.

791
01:01:45,118 --> 01:01:46,118
Hello?

792
01:01:48,914 --> 01:01:51,452
You have lovely... shutters.

793
01:01:53,627 --> 01:01:54,834
Thank you.

794
01:01:54,878 --> 01:01:58,872
Good.
Now, I find your scent overwhelming.

795
01:01:58,924 --> 01:02:00,790
I find your scent overwhelming.

796
01:02:00,884 --> 01:02:03,046
From all the way down there?

797
01:02:03,428 --> 01:02:05,670
You must have an excellent sense of smell.

798
01:02:06,264 --> 01:02:09,712
I can see the stars in your eyes.

799
01:02:10,644 --> 01:02:13,011
And superior eyesight.

800
01:02:13,563 --> 01:02:14,563
Yeah.

801
01:02:14,564 --> 01:02:18,274
Uh... Smell, sight, all my senses
are quite respectable.

802
01:02:20,111 --> 01:02:21,192
Is someone there?

803
01:02:21,196 --> 01:02:24,405
- I challenge you to a jaw-lock.
- I challenge you to a jaw-lock?

804
01:02:25,909 --> 01:02:27,275
Do you mean lockjaw?

805
01:02:27,327 --> 01:02:28,327
Are you ill?

806
01:02:28,411 --> 01:02:30,348
When I first saw you,
I wanted to pounce.

807
01:02:30,372 --> 01:02:32,653
When I first... Right, you know what?
This is not working.

808
01:02:36,294 --> 01:02:37,956
I'm Lukas.

809
01:02:37,963 --> 01:02:41,081
I saw you in the market the other day.
You were buying plants.

810
01:02:42,259 --> 01:02:43,875
- Medicinal herbs.
- Yeah.

811
01:02:44,386 --> 01:02:45,627
You're a healer?

812
01:02:46,054 --> 01:02:47,215
And you are...

813
01:02:47,264 --> 01:02:49,426
Wondering if you'd like
to walk the square.

814
01:02:52,727 --> 01:02:55,140
- If my father sees us...
- Then I'll pretend I have a fever.

815
01:02:55,230 --> 01:02:56,721
I'm very good at retching.

816
01:03:03,989 --> 01:03:06,823
We are good, aren't we? Mm. Magical.

817
01:03:06,866 --> 01:03:08,448
What in heavens is jaw-lock?

818
01:03:08,493 --> 01:03:10,985
A courting ritual.
You lock teeth, and then...

819
01:03:11,037 --> 01:03:13,154
Look, that's it. We're done. We're done.

820
01:03:19,212 --> 01:03:21,625
Aw, that's really sweet.

821
01:03:21,631 --> 01:03:24,123
Yeah, I just thought
'cause you like flowers and stuff.

822
01:03:24,175 --> 01:03:25,211
I do.

823
01:03:25,885 --> 01:03:27,171
Where did you get them?

824
01:03:27,804 --> 01:03:29,261
Just the market, you know?

825
01:03:30,432 --> 01:03:31,673
They're my neighbors'.

826
01:03:32,559 --> 01:03:35,176
- No, they're not.
- They're definitely my neighbors'.

827
01:03:37,147 --> 01:03:38,263
I like them, though.

828
01:03:39,065 --> 01:03:40,397
Do you like the color?

829
01:03:40,442 --> 01:03:42,058
I do. Red's my favorite.

830
01:03:42,110 --> 01:03:43,567
No way! Red's my favorite color.

831
01:03:44,112 --> 01:03:45,273
It's actually blue.

832
01:03:45,780 --> 01:03:47,863
- What?
- Blue's my favorite color.

833
01:04:41,127 --> 01:04:43,119
They're working for the king.

834
01:04:45,715 --> 01:04:47,001
Oh!

835
01:04:58,895 --> 01:05:00,477
Not so fast!

836
01:05:01,773 --> 01:05:04,516
All right, all right. All right.

837
01:05:19,791 --> 01:05:21,783
So, you're the one who snared the Snake?

838
01:05:22,252 --> 01:05:25,711
Him. And a young boy. A peasant.

839
01:05:25,839 --> 01:05:27,080
How did you find her?

840
01:05:29,008 --> 01:05:30,124
Little bird told me.

841
01:05:30,593 --> 01:05:32,334
A little bird.

842
01:05:38,351 --> 01:05:40,809
Listen, errand boy,

843
01:05:40,854 --> 01:05:42,766
I'm the only one
who's going to be celebrated

844
01:05:42,772 --> 01:05:45,856
for trapping these animals
and taking them to slaughter.

845
01:05:47,735 --> 01:05:49,897
And I'll do it when it suits me best.

846
01:05:53,116 --> 01:05:56,405
Get in my way again and I'll run you down.

847
01:06:00,457 --> 01:06:01,457
Hold him!

848
01:06:13,636 --> 01:06:14,717
Well, now.

849
01:06:14,846 --> 01:06:17,429
I've got a little extra
to bet on the dice.

850
01:06:22,437 --> 01:06:24,224
Not on the face, eh?

851
01:06:48,004 --> 01:06:49,040
Hi, Siveth.

852
01:06:49,547 --> 01:06:51,709
Oh.

853
01:06:52,634 --> 01:06:55,718
Right. Don't think this means
we're gonna play fetch or anything.

854
01:06:58,723 --> 01:07:00,385
So, was it just the two of you?

855
01:07:00,391 --> 01:07:02,303
You and this mercenary?

856
01:07:02,310 --> 01:07:04,393
Yeah. And the dra... Uh, my dog.

857
01:07:05,355 --> 01:07:06,846
Yeah. She's our secret weapon.

858
01:07:06,856 --> 01:07:08,848
A secret canine weapon?

859
01:07:08,900 --> 01:07:10,436
I like the sound of that.

860
01:07:10,443 --> 01:07:12,856
- She must be fierce.
- Oh, the fiercest.

861
01:07:15,156 --> 01:07:17,273
So, there's the jail.

862
01:07:17,283 --> 01:07:19,366
My father could come out any moment.

863
01:07:25,792 --> 01:07:27,909
Meet me at the market tomorrow?

864
01:07:28,002 --> 01:07:29,789
I'll teach you all about
nettles and thistles.

865
01:07:29,796 --> 01:07:31,162
Sounds irresistible.

866
01:07:37,637 --> 01:07:39,378
My cheeks hurt.

867
01:07:39,389 --> 01:07:40,630
From smiling.

868
01:08:43,536 --> 01:08:46,199
Now, now. Don't be afraid.

869
01:08:48,791 --> 01:08:50,578
Makes a prison of your mind.

870
01:08:59,677 --> 01:09:01,168
- A cipher.
- Yeah.

871
01:09:02,347 --> 01:09:07,058
The man who was trying to burn the papers,
he was too... too well dressed.

872
01:09:07,101 --> 01:09:10,640
Carrying instructions
requires the king's approval.

873
01:09:13,024 --> 01:09:14,140
Those killers...

874
01:09:15,193 --> 01:09:17,981
Those killers weren't meeting
to make plans.

875
01:09:18,029 --> 01:09:19,065
They were...

876
01:09:20,865 --> 01:09:22,481
They were getting new orders.

877
01:09:27,580 --> 01:09:28,741
What's happened?

878
01:09:28,790 --> 01:09:31,453
You know,
private audience with the king.

879
01:09:31,501 --> 01:09:33,145
You tried taking him on alone, didn't you?

880
01:09:33,169 --> 01:09:35,331
See, there you go again,
making me sound silly.

881
01:09:35,380 --> 01:09:37,246
- It's the food.
- What?

882
01:09:37,298 --> 01:09:39,210
It's the food shortages.

883
01:09:39,258 --> 01:09:41,170
Fears of starvation.

884
01:09:41,177 --> 01:09:43,089
Fears that could topple a king.

885
01:09:43,137 --> 01:09:45,049
Unless a greater fear comes along.

886
01:09:45,098 --> 01:09:47,966
But those papers
will topple him for us.

887
01:09:48,768 --> 01:09:51,351
The people will see he's corrupt
and that I was right.

888
01:09:52,355 --> 01:09:54,438
All those years ago, I was right.

889
01:09:54,524 --> 01:09:56,607
Now who can't let something go?

890
01:09:57,360 --> 01:10:00,444
I'm sorry
I didn't tell you the truth, Darius.

891
01:10:00,488 --> 01:10:02,730
But you haven't been
the only one to suffer.

892
01:10:03,241 --> 01:10:05,608
Thirty years I've been in exile,

893
01:10:05,618 --> 01:10:07,029
my name a curse.

894
01:10:07,537 --> 01:10:09,324
That ends tonight.

895
01:10:09,372 --> 01:10:11,705
Not if we don't get those papers back.

896
01:10:12,291 --> 01:10:14,783
If they find them, they'll destroy them.

897
01:10:14,836 --> 01:10:16,327
Fire!

898
01:10:16,379 --> 01:10:19,417
Come on, quickly!

899
01:10:23,761 --> 01:10:25,047
Fetch water!

900
01:10:25,054 --> 01:10:27,296
Fire! Fire!

901
01:10:28,349 --> 01:10:31,262
Boy, come on. Get back. Back. No.

902
01:10:31,310 --> 01:10:32,346
Help!

903
01:10:32,979 --> 01:10:35,221
- Oana!
- Help!

904
01:10:44,115 --> 01:10:45,777
Fire's out.

905
01:10:45,825 --> 01:10:47,657
- Oana!
- Lukas!

906
01:10:47,660 --> 01:10:48,946
Oana.

907
01:10:50,747 --> 01:10:52,909
Someone came for the prisoner.

908
01:10:52,957 --> 01:10:56,826
He had a staff and he stung his face!

909
01:10:57,378 --> 01:10:58,960
The Scorpion.

910
01:11:04,010 --> 01:11:06,093
He's been poisoned. Can you treat him?

911
01:11:06,095 --> 01:11:07,757
Yes! If we hurry.

912
01:11:08,181 --> 01:11:09,672
You, you take him.

913
01:11:13,102 --> 01:11:14,593
Go! Go!

914
01:11:18,024 --> 01:11:20,983
Come, we must get those papers back
to entrap the king.

915
01:11:21,110 --> 01:11:22,671
But the Snake and the Scorpion
are getting away.

916
01:11:22,695 --> 01:11:24,436
Time enough to find them. Listen to me.

917
01:11:24,489 --> 01:11:26,258
I did listen to you,
and if we'd killed the Snake,

918
01:11:26,282 --> 01:11:27,614
none of this would've happened.

919
01:11:27,658 --> 01:11:29,490
- This is your fault.
- Kid, come on.

920
01:11:29,535 --> 01:11:30,651
No, I'm going after them.

921
01:11:30,703 --> 01:11:33,616
They take their orders from the king.
He is responsible.

922
01:11:33,623 --> 01:11:36,491
And if we wait any longer,
there may be no way to prove it.

923
01:11:37,293 --> 01:11:38,500
You said you'd help.

924
01:11:39,545 --> 01:11:40,581
Are you coming?

925
01:11:41,756 --> 01:11:42,792
I can't.

926
01:11:46,844 --> 01:11:48,210
He was right all along.

927
01:11:53,309 --> 01:11:56,143
Don't you see those papers
are more important?

928
01:11:56,187 --> 01:11:57,303
Go.

929
01:11:58,231 --> 01:12:00,097
I'll stick with him. Go on.

930
01:12:11,619 --> 01:12:14,111
Brilliant.
He stole my horse.

931
01:12:15,706 --> 01:12:17,163
Of course, he stole my horse.

932
01:12:38,771 --> 01:12:40,057
What are you up to tonight?

933
01:13:06,924 --> 01:13:08,711
Come on, kid. This way.

934
01:13:44,879 --> 01:13:46,791
The tracks. They're here.

935
01:13:58,768 --> 01:14:01,476
I don't like it. They could be anywhere.

936
01:14:02,897 --> 01:14:04,138
Can't you ask a bird?

937
01:14:05,358 --> 01:14:07,099
You see any birds, genius?

938
01:14:21,540 --> 01:14:24,533
I'm telling you, it feels like a...

939
01:14:24,543 --> 01:14:25,875
- There they are!
- Ambush!

940
01:14:30,007 --> 01:14:31,088
Mercenaries.

941
01:14:32,343 --> 01:14:34,130
I can't see the Snake or the Scorpion.

942
01:14:34,178 --> 01:14:37,137
Probably on the run
while we're otherwise engaged.

943
01:14:37,139 --> 01:14:38,220
All right.

944
01:14:39,058 --> 01:14:40,594
Time to even up these odds.

945
01:14:52,321 --> 01:14:55,439
- Ready to lose, boys?
- Right. We'll see about that.

946
01:15:24,353 --> 01:15:26,310
I knew he would. I knew he would.

947
01:15:26,439 --> 01:15:28,726
No!

948
01:15:28,733 --> 01:15:30,520
What do you got there?
What do you got there?

949
01:15:34,864 --> 01:15:35,945
You see that hill?

950
01:15:36,073 --> 01:15:37,073
I'll cover you.

951
01:15:37,074 --> 01:15:38,281
You scramble up there,

952
01:15:38,284 --> 01:15:40,150
you find the horses,
you get back to the town.

953
01:15:40,161 --> 01:15:41,652
No, no! I'm not leaving you here!

954
01:15:41,787 --> 01:15:43,369
The hunt's over, kid.

955
01:15:43,372 --> 01:15:44,738
This is survival.

956
01:15:45,416 --> 01:15:46,452
Please.

957
01:15:47,877 --> 01:15:48,877
Go on.

958
01:16:29,001 --> 01:16:30,037
No.

959
01:16:56,362 --> 01:16:57,773
Don't touch the jewelry.

960
01:17:02,409 --> 01:17:03,570
Oh, Lukas.

961
01:17:23,973 --> 01:17:26,090
I must see the king at once.

962
01:17:33,732 --> 01:17:34,732
See it!

963
01:17:38,404 --> 01:17:39,520
<i>See!</i>

964
01:17:41,574 --> 01:17:42,610
<i>See this!</i>

965
01:17:47,663 --> 01:17:48,824
<i>Siveth.</i>

966
01:17:48,956 --> 01:17:49,956
No!

967
01:17:51,167 --> 01:17:52,533
Down below!

968
01:17:53,627 --> 01:17:54,913
Darius!

969
01:18:15,232 --> 01:18:16,894
Just you now, sellsword.

970
01:18:17,610 --> 01:18:19,192
Lovely boy.

971
01:18:34,168 --> 01:18:35,896
Are you sure it was me
who killed your parents?

972
01:18:35,920 --> 01:18:37,912
So many disreputable characters
these days!

973
01:18:37,922 --> 01:18:39,038
I know everything.

974
01:18:39,173 --> 01:18:41,665
You. The king. My farm!

975
01:18:45,304 --> 01:18:46,385
Ah, yes.

976
01:18:47,097 --> 01:18:48,554
Beautiful land.

977
01:18:49,099 --> 01:18:50,099
Maybe I'll go back there.

978
01:18:50,226 --> 01:18:52,138
You could come. Would you like that?

979
01:18:55,481 --> 01:18:58,440
I could be her, your mother.

980
01:19:44,697 --> 01:19:46,359
I'm on my way.

981
01:20:48,427 --> 01:20:50,760
Close your eyes now. Good night.

982
01:21:52,533 --> 01:21:53,569
I surrender.

983
01:22:00,207 --> 01:22:02,915
Spare me and I'll tell everyone
the king hired us.

984
01:22:06,296 --> 01:22:08,413
How he paid us to kill the hungriest.

985
01:22:13,053 --> 01:22:14,840
The hungriest first.

986
01:22:23,564 --> 01:22:26,147
Do you understand me, you dumb animal?

987
01:22:38,537 --> 01:22:39,698
Lukas?

988
01:22:44,251 --> 01:22:45,833
It's all my fault.

989
01:22:48,714 --> 01:22:50,250
I let vengeance darken my heart.

990
01:22:50,841 --> 01:22:52,707
I'm sorry, Siveth.

991
01:22:52,759 --> 01:22:56,173
When I thought you'd been
taken from me, so did I.

992
01:22:56,555 --> 01:22:58,717
Can't you take it back?

993
01:22:58,765 --> 01:23:00,301
Take it back, give it to him?

994
01:23:01,059 --> 01:23:02,391
I can't.

995
01:23:02,436 --> 01:23:04,018
Come. I'll carry you too.

996
01:23:05,355 --> 01:23:06,641
I'll slow you down.

997
01:23:07,441 --> 01:23:08,477
Go.

998
01:23:09,109 --> 01:23:10,225
Save him.

999
01:23:13,447 --> 01:23:14,608
I'll come back.

1000
01:23:17,868 --> 01:23:19,325
I believe you.

1001
01:23:21,497 --> 01:23:22,738
I believe you.

1002
01:23:24,875 --> 01:23:25,991
Go on.

1003
01:24:07,459 --> 01:24:09,166
I'm flying.

1004
01:24:11,421 --> 01:24:14,585
Yes. You're flying.

1005
01:24:18,554 --> 01:24:20,420
Siveth, look, stars.

1006
01:24:22,641 --> 01:24:24,849
You'll be up there one day.
I just know it.

1007
01:24:26,853 --> 01:24:29,311
Keep your eyes on the stars, Lukas.

1008
01:24:29,898 --> 01:24:31,764
Keep looking up.

1009
01:24:39,032 --> 01:24:40,568
You're all right.

1010
01:24:43,036 --> 01:24:44,197
You're safe now.

1011
01:24:48,000 --> 01:24:49,992
For weeks
we thought we'd lose you.

1012
01:24:51,128 --> 01:24:53,711
We had to summon an expert.

1013
01:24:54,965 --> 01:24:56,922
There he is.

1014
01:24:59,511 --> 01:25:00,672
How are you feeling?

1015
01:25:03,390 --> 01:25:06,303
No secret weapon
to help you talk to me this time.

1016
01:25:38,425 --> 01:25:40,462
Trouble.

1017
01:25:43,555 --> 01:25:44,921
Come on.

1018
01:26:03,075 --> 01:26:04,191
Dragon!

1019
01:26:04,743 --> 01:26:07,907
You disgrace yourself yet again
by harboring criminals.

1020
01:26:07,996 --> 01:26:09,578
The only criminal here is you.

1021
01:26:10,666 --> 01:26:13,454
And there he is, the young cur,

1022
01:26:13,543 --> 01:26:17,662
who assisted the villains' jailbreak,
leaving my town on fire.

1023
01:26:17,714 --> 01:26:20,172
A fire I extinguished.

1024
01:26:21,510 --> 01:26:22,751
We'll make a note.

1025
01:26:23,804 --> 01:26:27,138
What can we expect in another 20 years?

1026
01:26:27,224 --> 01:26:30,968
Perhaps you'll mend a fence,
rescue a cat from a tree?

1027
01:26:35,190 --> 01:26:40,231
How about I find an honorable king
who protects his subjects,

1028
01:26:40,278 --> 01:26:42,565
instead of using them
for his own purposes?

1029
01:26:42,656 --> 01:26:44,397
Enough!

1030
01:26:44,491 --> 01:26:47,609
I command you to resume your banishment.

1031
01:26:47,661 --> 01:26:50,449
Step aside and give me that miscreant.

1032
01:26:51,498 --> 01:26:55,037
If there is anyone to arrest, it is you.

1033
01:26:55,085 --> 01:26:58,954
You are in league with the outlaws
who ravaged this kingdom.

1034
01:26:58,964 --> 01:27:00,830
The king?

1035
01:27:00,966 --> 01:27:04,801
It appears it is your word
against mine, traitor.

1036
01:27:05,846 --> 01:27:08,133
Who do you expect them to believe?

1037
01:27:08,181 --> 01:27:09,717
Him!

1038
01:27:16,815 --> 01:27:18,397
How did it work exactly?

1039
01:27:19,192 --> 01:27:20,152
Huh?

1040
01:27:20,153 --> 01:27:24,487
Your orders for these criminals were coded
so the messengers couldn't read them.

1041
01:27:24,614 --> 01:27:26,697
They were delivering instructions
to attack.

1042
01:27:27,284 --> 01:27:28,991
With death at their doors,

1043
01:27:29,119 --> 01:27:33,204
fewer would complain of your failure
to plan for food shortages.

1044
01:27:35,000 --> 01:27:36,582
I gave no such orders.

1045
01:27:42,466 --> 01:27:44,958
The dragon speaks the truth!

1046
01:27:45,051 --> 01:27:49,796
We raided when and where
His Majesty instructed.

1047
01:27:50,390 --> 01:27:53,349
Just like the border wars years ago.

1048
01:27:54,019 --> 01:27:58,559
Some of your soldiers
began to realize you were corrupt,

1049
01:27:58,648 --> 01:28:02,562
so you paid men to start a war
that never need happen

1050
01:28:02,652 --> 01:28:05,144
to make you more popular.

1051
01:28:10,118 --> 01:28:13,702
I was one of those men.

1052
01:28:15,373 --> 01:28:19,117
He'll say anything
to keep his neck from the noose.

1053
01:28:19,211 --> 01:28:20,497
Prepare to fire!

1054
01:28:21,713 --> 01:28:24,797
If there is anyone else
who wishes to speak,

1055
01:28:25,383 --> 01:28:27,500
I promise my protection.

1056
01:28:34,935 --> 01:28:36,551
I delivered such a message.

1057
01:28:37,521 --> 01:28:39,308
To him.

1058
01:28:39,314 --> 01:28:40,555
I did too.

1059
01:28:44,653 --> 01:28:47,612
- And in the king's name.
- Get back in line!

1060
01:28:47,656 --> 01:28:50,273
And I coded them.

1061
01:28:52,619 --> 01:28:53,985
I'm so sorry.

1062
01:28:55,288 --> 01:28:56,995
I am your sovereign.

1063
01:28:57,082 --> 01:28:58,948
Unhand me! Guards!

1064
01:28:59,000 --> 01:29:02,710
Defend me! Don't touch me! I am your...

1065
01:29:04,089 --> 01:29:06,957
Unhand me!

1066
01:29:18,353 --> 01:29:20,515
Come on. Go on, move!

1067
01:29:25,819 --> 01:29:28,653
Easy. Easy, easy. Don't hurt me.

1068
01:29:30,073 --> 01:29:31,735
Look at you.

1069
01:29:31,783 --> 01:29:33,399
After all these years.

1070
01:29:34,286 --> 01:29:36,994
So, you and she are...

1071
01:29:39,249 --> 01:29:40,615
A team.

1072
01:29:41,501 --> 01:29:43,743
Maybe one day,
you'd make a good king.

1073
01:29:44,963 --> 01:29:46,044
No?

1074
01:29:46,172 --> 01:29:47,629
King Darius?

1075
01:29:47,632 --> 01:29:50,716
King Darius the Beast Manager.

1076
01:29:50,719 --> 01:29:53,211
- Yeah.
- The beast manager.

1077
01:29:53,346 --> 01:29:55,008
You make it sound silly.

1078
01:29:55,140 --> 01:29:57,803
You are silly.

1079
01:29:58,685 --> 01:30:02,224
<i>In the end,
no one went hungry.</i>

1080
01:30:02,230 --> 01:30:03,687
<i>Siveth had had the foresight</i>

1081
01:30:03,732 --> 01:30:06,725
<i>to save half of all the crop seed
people had paid her,</i>

1082
01:30:06,735 --> 01:30:09,478
<i>storing them safely
in her ice cave.</i>

1083
01:30:09,988 --> 01:30:11,149
A deal's a deal.

1084
01:30:11,907 --> 01:30:13,443
Your investment paid off.

1085
01:30:16,620 --> 01:30:17,827
Prime land.

1086
01:30:19,414 --> 01:30:23,374
But to tell you the truth,
I'd rather have the friend.

1087
01:30:25,003 --> 01:30:28,337
Besides, now you can buy my horseshoes.

1088
01:30:29,007 --> 01:30:30,623
Top quality.

1089
01:30:30,634 --> 01:30:31,875
No more scrap.

1090
01:30:36,181 --> 01:30:41,097
<i>After the snows melted,
we helped Lukas rebuild his farm,</i>

1091
01:30:41,144 --> 01:30:43,227
<i>a place where he could start
a new life.</i>

1092
01:30:44,814 --> 01:30:49,650
<i>When we're alone, our sorrows
can bring out our darkest selves.</i>

1093
01:30:49,653 --> 01:30:50,734
Come on, you.

1094
01:30:50,737 --> 01:30:54,071
<i>But sharing our heart
lights a better way.</i>

1095
01:31:02,832 --> 01:31:04,949
A toast to my new family.

1096
01:31:05,627 --> 01:31:08,745
You've all given me happiness,
so I wish the same for you.

1097
01:31:11,424 --> 01:31:13,211
What a party!

1098
01:31:14,260 --> 01:31:15,796
Can we have another tomorrow?

1099
01:32:05,729 --> 01:32:09,473
<i>As I said, sometimes
it takes the most unlikely person</i>

1100
01:32:09,607 --> 01:32:11,348
<i>to help you find hope again.</i>

1101
01:32:12,193 --> 01:32:15,186
<i>Then hope takes wing
and carries you aloft,</i>

1102
01:32:15,739 --> 01:32:18,732
<i>and you just keep looking up.</i>
