1
00:00:56,387 --> 00:00:58,514
My planet Arrakis is so beautiful

2
00:00:58,597 --> 00:01:00,057
when the sun is low.

3
00:01:03,519 --> 00:01:05,187
Rolling over the sands...

4
00:01:06,272 --> 00:01:08,482
you can see spice in the air.

5
00:01:21,704 --> 00:01:25,291
At nightfall, the spice harvesters land.

6
00:01:26,792 --> 00:01:30,463
The outsiders race against time
to avoid the heat of the day.

7
00:01:40,556 --> 00:01:43,476
They ravage our lands
in front of our eyes.

8
00:01:44,518 --> 00:01:47,480
Their cruelty to my people
is all I've known.

9
00:01:53,027 --> 00:01:55,404
These outsiders, the Harkonnens,

10
00:01:55,488 --> 00:01:57,490
came long before I was born.

11
00:01:57,656 --> 00:01:59,533
By controlling spice production,

12
00:01:59,617 --> 00:02:01,410
they became obscenely rich.

13
00:02:01,744 --> 00:02:03,537
Richer than the Emperor himself.

14
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:49,250
Our warriors couldn't free
Arrakis from the Harkonnens,

15
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:50,751
but one day,

16
00:02:50,835 --> 00:02:53,879
by Imperial decree, they were gone.

17
00:03:01,053 --> 00:03:03,264
Why did the Emperor choose this path?

18
00:03:04,807 --> 00:03:07,059
And who will our next oppressors be?

19
00:03:58,486 --> 00:04:00,070
It's good you're up early.

20
00:04:01,739 --> 00:04:02,907
Your father wants you in full dress

21
00:04:02,990 --> 00:04:04,575
before the Emperor's Herald arrives.

22
00:04:05,493 --> 00:04:06,744
Full dress?

23
00:04:07,870 --> 00:04:08,829
Military?

24
00:04:09,538 --> 00:04:11,457
- Ceremonial.

25
00:04:12,208 --> 00:04:13,417
Why do we have to go
through all this

26
00:04:13,501 --> 00:04:14,668
when it's already been decided?

27
00:04:16,295 --> 00:04:17,338
Ceremony.

28
00:04:18,047 --> 00:04:19,048
Mm.

29
00:04:19,965 --> 00:04:20,883
Thank you.

30
00:04:22,801 --> 00:04:24,595
If you want it, make me give it to you.

31
00:04:26,096 --> 00:04:27,056
Use the Voice.

32
00:04:27,806 --> 00:04:28,933
Mom, I just woke up.

33
00:04:37,233 --> 00:04:38,359
Give me the water.

34
00:04:39,485 --> 00:04:41,320
The glass can't hear you.
Command me.

35
00:05:09,181 --> 00:05:10,724
Give me the water.

36
00:05:23,404 --> 00:05:24,363
Almost.

37
00:05:24,947 --> 00:05:25,948
Almost?

38
00:05:26,448 --> 00:05:28,701
Bene Gesserit skills
take years to learn, Paul.

39
00:05:28,784 --> 00:05:30,995
-  Mm-hmm.
- You look tired.

40
00:05:32,329 --> 00:05:33,372
More dreams?

41
00:05:39,420 --> 00:05:40,504
No.

42
00:05:43,591 --> 00:05:45,050
Extreme temperatures

43
00:05:45,134 --> 00:05:46,885
and treacherous weather events

44
00:05:47,052 --> 00:05:50,639
make life outside the cities
of Arrakis truly hostile,

45
00:05:50,806 --> 00:05:52,600
with sandstorms powerful enough

46
00:05:52,683 --> 00:05:53,934
to cut through metal.

47
00:05:54,518 --> 00:05:57,104
Only the native tribes
known as the Fremen

48
00:05:57,271 --> 00:05:59,732
have adapted well enough to survive.

49
00:06:01,275 --> 00:06:04,528
Preferring to inhabit
the remotest regions of Arrakis,

50
00:06:05,696 --> 00:06:07,323
the Fremen share the deep desert

51
00:06:07,406 --> 00:06:08,991
with the giant sandworms

52
00:06:09,408 --> 00:06:11,619
known to the Fremen as Shai-Hulud.

53
00:06:12,703 --> 00:06:15,289
Long exposure to spice
has given the tribe

54
00:06:15,372 --> 00:06:17,333
their characteristic blue eyes,

55
00:06:18,292 --> 00:06:19,960
the Eyes of Ibad.

56
00:06:20,252 --> 00:06:22,046
Little else is known of the Fremen,

57
00:06:23,088 --> 00:06:25,966
except that they are dangerous
and unreliable.

58
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:29,970
Fremen attacks make spice harvesting

59
00:06:30,054 --> 00:06:31,805
extremely hazardous.

60
00:06:32,681 --> 00:06:35,809
For the Fremen,
spice is the sacred hallucinogen

61
00:06:36,060 --> 00:06:37,144
which preserves life

62
00:06:37,227 --> 00:06:39,438
and brings enormous health benefits.

63
00:06:40,856 --> 00:06:41,774
For the Imperium,

64
00:06:41,857 --> 00:06:43,901
spice is used by the navigators

65
00:06:43,984 --> 00:06:45,694
of the Spacing Guild

66
00:06:45,778 --> 00:06:48,322
to find safe paths between the stars.

67
00:06:48,864 --> 00:06:49,907
Without spice,

68
00:06:50,115 --> 00:06:52,576
interstellar travel is impossible,

69
00:06:53,118 --> 00:06:54,244
making it by far

70
00:06:54,328 --> 00:06:57,247
the most valuable substance
in the universe.

71
00:07:47,131 --> 00:07:48,173
Smile, Gurney.

72
00:07:49,383 --> 00:07:50,592
I am smiling.

73
00:07:52,386 --> 00:07:53,721
How much will it cost them,

74
00:07:54,138 --> 00:07:56,140
traveling all this way
for this formality?

75
00:07:56,765 --> 00:07:57,766
Three Guild Navigators.

76
00:07:57,850 --> 00:08:01,603
A total of 1.46 million,
62 solaris, round trip.

77
00:08:17,703 --> 00:08:20,372
By the grace of Shaddam IV
of House Corrino,

78
00:08:20,914 --> 00:08:22,875
ascendant to the Golden Lion Throne

79
00:08:22,958 --> 00:08:25,335
of Padishah Emperor
of the Known Universe,

80
00:08:25,961 --> 00:08:29,089
I stand before you
as Herald of the Change.

81
00:08:30,215 --> 00:08:32,634
We are witnessed by members
of the Imperial Court,

82
00:08:33,260 --> 00:08:35,304
representatives of the Spacing Guild

83
00:08:35,846 --> 00:08:38,515
and a sister of the Bene Gesserit.

84
00:08:40,434 --> 00:08:42,644
The Emperor has spoken.

85
00:08:44,271 --> 00:08:48,484
"House Atreides shall immediately
take control of Arrakis

86
00:08:49,193 --> 00:08:51,695
and serve as its steward."

87
00:08:53,781 --> 00:08:54,782
Do you accept?

88
00:09:05,042 --> 00:09:06,460
We are House Atreides.

89
00:09:07,961 --> 00:09:11,715
There is no call we do not answer,
there is no faith that we betray.

90
00:09:12,508 --> 00:09:16,094
The Emperor asks us
to bring peace to Arrakis.

91
00:09:17,387 --> 00:09:19,223
House Atreides accepts.

92
00:09:20,098 --> 00:09:23,769
Atreides! Atreides! Atreides!

93
00:09:24,311 --> 00:09:27,898
Atreides! Atreides! Atreides!

94
00:09:35,906 --> 00:09:36,949
Your seal.

95
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:14,361
So, it's done?

96
00:10:16,238 --> 00:10:17,239
It's done.

97
00:10:43,891 --> 00:10:44,892
How was it?

98
00:10:45,642 --> 00:10:47,102
Stabilizers are too loose.

99
00:10:47,519 --> 00:10:49,438
- We'll dial it in.
- Thank you, my friend.

100
00:10:49,521 --> 00:10:50,564
Got it.

101
00:10:51,356 --> 00:10:52,316
Duncan.

102
00:10:52,482 --> 00:10:53,483
My boy.

103
00:10:53,650 --> 00:10:54,860
- Hey. Hey.

104
00:10:55,235 --> 00:10:56,361
Paul, my boy.

105
00:10:58,530 --> 00:10:59,948
So, you're going to Arrakis tomorrow.

106
00:11:00,991 --> 00:11:02,075
With the advance team.

107
00:11:02,576 --> 00:11:03,827
Yes, I'm going to Arrakis tomorrow

108
00:11:03,911 --> 00:11:04,953
with the advance team.

109
00:11:06,538 --> 00:11:07,748
I'd like you to take me with you.

110
00:11:08,832 --> 00:11:09,833
You would?

111
00:11:11,209 --> 00:11:12,628
Well, that's too bad. 'Cause no.

112
00:11:14,087 --> 00:11:15,130
Duncan.

113
00:11:15,297 --> 00:11:17,090
Are you trying
to get me court-martialed?

114
00:11:18,717 --> 00:11:19,801
What's going on?

115
00:11:19,885 --> 00:11:20,928
Can I trust you with something?

116
00:11:21,428 --> 00:11:22,387
Always. You know that.

117
00:11:29,311 --> 00:11:30,979
I've been having dreams.

118
00:11:33,398 --> 00:11:35,525
About Arrakis and the Fremen.

119
00:11:44,368 --> 00:11:45,452
Okay.

120
00:11:46,161 --> 00:11:47,287
So?

121
00:11:48,830 --> 00:11:49,915
I saw you.

122
00:11:53,418 --> 00:11:54,586
With the Fremen.

123
00:11:55,504 --> 00:11:56,505
Ah.

124
00:11:57,422 --> 00:11:58,590
So, I do find them.

125
00:11:58,799 --> 00:12:00,801
There you go. That's a good
omen right there, right?

126
00:12:03,553 --> 00:12:04,554
Lanville!

127
00:12:11,269 --> 00:12:12,729
I saw you lying dead.

128
00:12:13,647 --> 00:12:15,232
Fallen in battle.

129
00:12:17,234 --> 00:12:18,777
It felt like if I had been there,

130
00:12:19,528 --> 00:12:20,779
you'd be alive.

131
00:12:25,951 --> 00:12:27,661
First off, I'm not gonna die.

132
00:12:27,995 --> 00:12:29,079
You're not taking me seriously.

133
00:12:29,162 --> 00:12:30,956
That's why you want
to come with me. Listen.

134
00:12:32,874 --> 00:12:34,126
Dreams make good stories,

135
00:12:34,668 --> 00:12:36,586
but everything important
happens when we're awake.

136
00:12:37,087 --> 00:12:38,463
'Cause that's when
we make things happen.

137
00:12:39,172 --> 00:12:41,174
Look at you. Put on some muscle?

138
00:12:41,466 --> 00:12:42,342
I did?

139
00:12:42,634 --> 00:12:43,719
No.

140
00:12:46,304 --> 00:12:47,472
Hey.

141
00:12:48,390 --> 00:12:49,975
See you on Arrakis, my boy.

142
00:13:25,677 --> 00:13:27,637
Father, I'd like to ask
to join Duncan Idaho

143
00:13:27,721 --> 00:13:29,931
on his scout mission
to Arrakis tomorrow.

144
00:13:30,557 --> 00:13:32,225
I've studied the Fremen language,
I'd be an asset.

145
00:13:32,392 --> 00:13:33,518
Out of the question.

146
00:13:33,685 --> 00:13:35,062
You'll travel in a few weeks to Arrakis,

147
00:13:35,145 --> 00:13:36,146
like the rest of us.

148
00:13:36,313 --> 00:13:37,647
I've been training my whole life.

149
00:13:37,731 --> 00:13:39,232
What is the point if I'm not allowed

150
00:13:39,316 --> 00:13:41,109
- to face some actual risk?
- You know why, Paul.

151
00:13:42,027 --> 00:13:43,862
You're the future of House Atreides.

152
00:13:44,196 --> 00:13:46,198
And Grandfather fought bulls for sport!

153
00:13:46,281 --> 00:13:47,157
Yes.

154
00:13:48,408 --> 00:13:49,576
And look where that got him.

155
00:13:54,331 --> 00:13:55,707
I need you by my side.

156
00:13:56,958 --> 00:13:59,294
When we get to Arrakis,
we'll face enormous danger.

157
00:13:59,711 --> 00:14:00,796
What danger?

158
00:14:01,505 --> 00:14:03,340
The Fremen? The desert?

159
00:14:03,423 --> 00:14:04,883
Political danger.

160
00:14:07,511 --> 00:14:09,971
The Great Houses
look to us for leadership,

161
00:14:10,597 --> 00:14:12,265
and this threatens the Emperor.

162
00:14:12,891 --> 00:14:15,811
By taking Arrakis from the Harkonnens
and making it ours,

163
00:14:16,186 --> 00:14:17,687
he sets the stage for a war

164
00:14:18,313 --> 00:14:19,981
which would weaken both houses.

165
00:14:21,942 --> 00:14:23,318
But if we hold firm,

166
00:14:23,902 --> 00:14:25,821
and tap the true power of Arrakis,

167
00:14:25,904 --> 00:14:27,697
we could be stronger than ever.

168
00:14:28,198 --> 00:14:29,282
What does that mean?

169
00:14:30,117 --> 00:14:32,577
Mining spice,
keeping the Fremen in their place?

170
00:14:32,744 --> 00:14:34,412
- We'd be no better than Harkonnens.
- No.

171
00:14:35,747 --> 00:14:38,125
By making an alliance with the Fremen.

172
00:14:39,042 --> 00:14:41,169
That's what I've sent
Duncan Idaho to arrange.

173
00:14:42,838 --> 00:14:43,755
Here on Caladan,

174
00:14:43,880 --> 00:14:46,633
we've ruled by air power and sea power.

175
00:14:46,883 --> 00:14:50,220
On Arrakis, we need
to cultivate desert power.

176
00:14:54,015 --> 00:14:55,433
I want you sitting in on my Council.

177
00:14:55,725 --> 00:14:56,810
Learn what I do.

178
00:14:57,269 --> 00:14:58,478
What if I'm not, Dad?

179
00:14:59,938 --> 00:15:00,814
Not what?

180
00:15:03,483 --> 00:15:05,235
The future of House Atreides.

181
00:15:18,290 --> 00:15:20,208
I told my father
I didn't want this either.

182
00:15:24,713 --> 00:15:25,881
I wanted to be a pilot.

183
00:15:27,883 --> 00:15:29,050
You never told me that.

184
00:15:32,387 --> 00:15:33,597
Your grandfather said,

185
00:15:34,639 --> 00:15:36,641
"A great man doesn't seek to lead.

186
00:15:37,434 --> 00:15:40,478
He's called to it, and he answers."

187
00:15:42,731 --> 00:15:44,274
And if your answer is no...

188
00:15:47,861 --> 00:15:50,155
you'll still be the only thing
I ever needed you to be...

189
00:15:52,657 --> 00:15:53,700
my son.

190
00:16:04,211 --> 00:16:07,756
I found my own way to it.
Maybe you'll find yours.

191
00:16:11,551 --> 00:16:12,802
In their memory...

192
00:16:15,972 --> 00:16:17,057
give it a try.

193
00:16:26,524 --> 00:16:28,526
Don't stand
with your back to the door.

194
00:16:30,028 --> 00:16:31,571
How many times do we have to tell you?

195
00:16:31,655 --> 00:16:33,073
I could tell it was you

196
00:16:33,156 --> 00:16:34,824
by your footsteps, Gurney Halleck.

197
00:16:34,991 --> 00:16:37,077
Someone
might imitate my stride.

198
00:16:37,786 --> 00:16:39,079
I know the difference.

199
00:16:39,246 --> 00:16:40,747
Are you the new Weapons Master?

200
00:16:40,914 --> 00:16:44,417
With Duncan Idaho gone,
I must make do as best I can.

201
00:16:45,627 --> 00:16:46,628
Choose your blade.

202
00:16:47,087 --> 00:16:48,380
I've had quite a day, Gurney.

203
00:16:49,047 --> 00:16:50,215
Give us a song instead.

204
00:16:55,512 --> 00:16:56,554
That's rude.

205
00:17:14,114 --> 00:17:15,073
Come on.

206
00:17:15,699 --> 00:17:16,700
Come on.

207
00:17:16,783 --> 00:17:17,784
Old man.

208
00:17:29,838 --> 00:17:32,048
Ah, the slow blade
penetrates the shield.

209
00:17:39,472 --> 00:17:40,598
I guess I'm not in the mood today.

210
00:17:41,308 --> 00:17:42,434
- Mood?
- Yeah.

211
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:43,601
What's mood to do with it?

212
00:17:43,768 --> 00:17:45,520
You fight when the necessity arises,

213
00:17:45,603 --> 00:17:46,604
no matter the mood.

214
00:17:46,688 --> 00:17:47,731
Now fight!

215
00:17:53,236 --> 00:17:54,237
Come on!

216
00:18:06,041 --> 00:18:07,917
- I have you.

217
00:18:08,376 --> 00:18:09,502
Aye.

218
00:18:10,253 --> 00:18:11,838
But look down, my lord.

219
00:18:12,005 --> 00:18:13,673
You'd have joined me in death.

220
00:18:14,674 --> 00:18:16,468
I see you found the mood.

221
00:18:28,938 --> 00:18:30,023
Will it be that bad?

222
00:18:30,565 --> 00:18:31,733
You don't get it, do you?

223
00:18:33,193 --> 00:18:34,319
You don't really understand

224
00:18:34,402 --> 00:18:36,780
the grave nature
of what's happening to us.

225
00:18:39,616 --> 00:18:40,992
For 80 years,

226
00:18:41,076 --> 00:18:43,161
Arrakis belonged to House Harkonnen.

227
00:18:43,328 --> 00:18:45,663
80 years of owning the spice fields.

228
00:18:45,997 --> 00:18:47,582
Can you imagine the wealth?

229
00:18:48,124 --> 00:18:49,959
Your eyes.
I need to see it in your eyes.

230
00:18:50,126 --> 00:18:52,420
You never met Harkonnens
before, I have.

231
00:18:52,879 --> 00:18:54,756
They're not human, they're brutal!

232
00:18:55,757 --> 00:18:57,300
You have to be ready.

233
00:19:39,634 --> 00:19:40,677
Lord Baron.

234
00:19:43,012 --> 00:19:44,097
Rabban.

235
00:19:45,306 --> 00:19:47,267
The last of our ships have left Arrakis.

236
00:19:48,768 --> 00:19:49,769
It's done.

237
00:19:50,437 --> 00:19:51,521
Very good.

238
00:19:55,066 --> 00:19:56,401
Uncle, how can we let this happen?

239
00:19:57,110 --> 00:19:58,027
How can the Emperor...

240
00:19:59,446 --> 00:20:01,489
...take everything
we've built

241
00:20:02,073 --> 00:20:03,491
and give it to that Duke?

242
00:20:04,159 --> 00:20:05,160
How?

243
00:20:05,785 --> 00:20:07,662
Don't be too sure it's an act of love.

244
00:20:10,540 --> 00:20:11,458
What does he mean?

245
00:20:18,047 --> 00:20:20,300
When is a gift not a gift?

246
00:20:22,677 --> 00:20:25,180
The Atreides' voice is rising,

247
00:20:26,514 --> 00:20:28,850
and the Emperor is a jealous man.

248
00:20:31,895 --> 00:20:34,689
A dangerous, jealous man.

249
00:21:46,010 --> 00:21:46,886
Paul.

250
00:21:48,805 --> 00:21:49,931
Paul, wake up.

251
00:21:56,521 --> 00:21:57,522
What's wrong?

252
00:21:57,605 --> 00:21:58,940
Get dressed and come with me.

253
00:22:20,253 --> 00:22:21,421
What is this?

254
00:22:21,588 --> 00:22:23,965
The Reverend Mother
Gaius Helen Mohiam is here.

255
00:22:24,882 --> 00:22:26,926
She was my teacher
at the Bene Gesserit school.

256
00:22:27,093 --> 00:22:29,470
She's now Truthsayer
to the Emperor himself.

257
00:22:30,597 --> 00:22:32,056
She would like to meet you.

258
00:22:32,974 --> 00:22:34,058
Why?

259
00:22:35,018 --> 00:22:36,644
She wants to know about your dreams.

260
00:22:38,521 --> 00:22:40,189
How does she know about my dreams?

261
00:22:42,984 --> 00:22:44,444
And why is Dr. Yueh here?

262
00:22:44,611 --> 00:22:45,987
He only needs a moment.

263
00:22:47,113 --> 00:22:48,364
Hello, young master.

264
00:22:49,282 --> 00:22:51,242
Your mother asked me
to check your vitals.

265
00:22:57,790 --> 00:22:58,833
What's happening?

266
00:23:20,772 --> 00:23:22,815
His heart
is strong as ever, my lady.

267
00:23:37,580 --> 00:23:38,706
Paul...

268
00:24:06,484 --> 00:24:11,864
Who are you?

269
00:24:16,327 --> 00:24:17,995
Defiance in the eyes.

270
00:24:18,788 --> 00:24:19,914
Like his father.

271
00:24:20,331 --> 00:24:21,332
Leave us.

272
00:24:22,291 --> 00:24:24,335
You must do everything
the Reverend Mother tells you.

273
00:24:28,256 --> 00:24:29,590
You dismiss my mother
in her own house.

274
00:24:29,674 --> 00:24:30,758
Come here.

275
00:24:31,342 --> 00:24:32,343
Kneel.

276
00:24:36,806 --> 00:24:38,391
How dare you use the Voice on me?

277
00:24:45,940 --> 00:24:47,108
Put your right
hand in the box.

278
00:24:49,402 --> 00:24:51,237
Your mother bade you obey me.

279
00:25:00,496 --> 00:25:02,165
I hold at your neck the Gom Jabbar.

280
00:25:03,666 --> 00:25:04,709
A poison needle.

281
00:25:05,168 --> 00:25:06,210
Instant death.

282
00:25:07,628 --> 00:25:08,671
The test is simple.

283
00:25:09,213 --> 00:25:10,757
Remove your hand from the box

284
00:25:11,632 --> 00:25:12,633
and you die.

285
00:25:14,427 --> 00:25:15,553
What's in the box?

286
00:25:17,305 --> 00:25:18,181
Pain.

287
00:25:19,932 --> 00:25:22,018
- No need to call the guards.

288
00:25:23,352 --> 00:25:24,771
Your mother stands behind that door.

289
00:25:24,854 --> 00:25:26,439
No one would get past her.

290
00:25:33,738 --> 00:25:34,947
Why are you doing this?

291
00:25:36,783 --> 00:25:40,912
An animal caught in a trap
will gnaw off its own leg to escape.

292
00:25:41,662 --> 00:25:42,914
What will you do?

293
00:26:14,904 --> 00:26:16,405
- Silence.

294
00:26:26,207 --> 00:26:27,625
I must not fear.

295
00:26:29,627 --> 00:26:30,962
I must not fear.

296
00:26:37,718 --> 00:26:39,095
Fear is the mind-killer.

297
00:26:41,347 --> 00:26:42,431
Fear

298
00:26:42,723 --> 00:26:44,976
is the little death
that brings obliteration.

299
00:26:48,020 --> 00:26:49,730
And I'll face my fear and I'll permit it

300
00:26:49,814 --> 00:26:51,023
to pass over me and through me.

301
00:27:06,372 --> 00:27:07,748
And when it has gone past...

302
00:27:16,632 --> 00:27:19,093
I will turn the inner eye
and see its path.

303
00:27:22,263 --> 00:27:24,849
And where the fear has gone,

304
00:27:25,975 --> 00:27:26,976
there will be nothing.

305
00:27:31,898 --> 00:27:33,232
Only I will remain.

306
00:27:37,737 --> 00:27:38,696
Enough.

307
00:27:55,755 --> 00:27:57,548
Like sifting sand through a screen,

308
00:27:58,382 --> 00:27:59,634
we sift people.

309
00:28:01,218 --> 00:28:03,679
If you had been unable
to control your impulses,

310
00:28:03,763 --> 00:28:04,931
like an animal,

311
00:28:05,806 --> 00:28:06,891
we could not let you live.

312
00:28:08,100 --> 00:28:09,518
You inherit too much power.

313
00:28:10,895 --> 00:28:11,896
What, because I'm a duke's son?

314
00:28:11,979 --> 00:28:13,564
Because you are Jessica's son.

315
00:28:15,149 --> 00:28:17,151
You have more than one birthright, boy.

316
00:28:19,111 --> 00:28:20,112
Jessica?

317
00:28:27,453 --> 00:28:28,996
You've been training him in the Way.

318
00:28:33,918 --> 00:28:35,544
Tell me about these dreams.

319
00:28:36,837 --> 00:28:38,839
- I had one tonight.
- What did you see?

320
00:28:41,425 --> 00:28:42,426
A girl.

321
00:28:43,219 --> 00:28:44,220
On Arrakis.

322
00:28:45,012 --> 00:28:46,347
Have you dreamt of her before?

323
00:28:50,685 --> 00:28:51,811
Many times.

324
00:28:54,563 --> 00:28:56,524
Do you often dream things that happen

325
00:28:56,607 --> 00:28:57,817
just as you dreamed them?

326
00:29:01,320 --> 00:29:02,405
Not exactly.

327
00:29:06,117 --> 00:29:07,368
Goodbye, young human.

328
00:29:08,494 --> 00:29:09,662
I hope you live.

329
00:29:18,337 --> 00:29:20,089
Did you have to go that far?

330
00:29:20,464 --> 00:29:21,757
You chose
to train him in the Way,

331
00:29:22,216 --> 00:29:23,551
in defiance of our rule.

332
00:29:24,135 --> 00:29:25,553
He wields our power.

333
00:29:25,803 --> 00:29:27,430
He had to be tested to the limits.

334
00:29:28,764 --> 00:29:30,808
So much potential, wasted in a male.

335
00:29:32,101 --> 00:29:33,728
You were told to bear only daughters.

336
00:29:34,020 --> 00:29:35,062
But you, in your pride,

337
00:29:35,146 --> 00:29:37,148
thought you could
produce the Kwisatz Haderach.

338
00:29:37,523 --> 00:29:38,649
Was I wrong?

339
00:29:39,108 --> 00:29:40,860
You're lucky he didn't die in that room.

340
00:29:41,986 --> 00:29:44,030
If he is The One,
he has a long way to go.

341
00:29:44,321 --> 00:29:46,991
His Sight is barely awakened,
and now he goes into the fire.

342
00:29:48,576 --> 00:29:50,786
But our plans are measured in centuries.

343
00:29:50,953 --> 00:29:52,246
We have other prospects

344
00:29:52,830 --> 00:29:54,540
if he fails his promise.

345
00:29:57,668 --> 00:29:59,086
Do you see so little hope?

346
00:30:00,212 --> 00:30:02,840
On Arrakis, we have done
all we can for you.

347
00:30:03,424 --> 00:30:04,759
A path has been laid.

348
00:30:05,426 --> 00:30:07,178
Let's hope he doesn't squander it.

349
00:30:54,725 --> 00:30:55,684
Paul.

350
00:30:57,228 --> 00:30:58,437
What does it mean?

351
00:31:00,106 --> 00:31:01,357
That I could be The One?

352
00:31:01,732 --> 00:31:02,900
You heard.

353
00:31:06,445 --> 00:31:07,696
The Bene Gesserit serve

354
00:31:07,780 --> 00:31:09,782
as powerful partners
to the Great Houses,

355
00:31:11,242 --> 00:31:12,368
but there's more to it.

356
00:31:12,827 --> 00:31:15,079
You steer the politics of the Imperium

357
00:31:15,162 --> 00:31:16,539
from the shadows.

358
00:31:17,331 --> 00:31:18,332
I know.

359
00:31:18,415 --> 00:31:20,084
You don't know everything.

360
00:31:21,585 --> 00:31:23,295
For thousands of years,

361
00:31:23,462 --> 00:31:25,631
we've been carefully crossing bloodlines

362
00:31:26,215 --> 00:31:27,925
- to bring forth...
- The One?

363
00:31:29,510 --> 00:31:30,719
A mind...

364
00:31:32,888 --> 00:31:36,809
powerful enough
to bridge space and time.

365
00:31:37,810 --> 00:31:39,311
Past and future.

366
00:31:41,814 --> 00:31:44,024
Who can help us into a better future.

367
00:31:45,276 --> 00:31:47,444
We think he's very close now.

368
00:31:49,864 --> 00:31:51,574
Some believe he's here.

369
00:31:56,036 --> 00:31:57,705
All part of a plan.

370
00:34:16,010 --> 00:34:16,969
Shield.

371
00:34:59,762 --> 00:35:01,597
"My lungs taste the air of Time,

372
00:35:01,680 --> 00:35:03,265
Blown past falling sand..."

373
00:35:48,310 --> 00:35:49,269
Thufir Hawat.

374
00:35:53,941 --> 00:35:55,442
Young master!

375
00:35:55,609 --> 00:35:57,736
How does it feel
to walk on a new world?

376
00:35:57,903 --> 00:35:59,738
Exciting, to say the least.

377
00:36:00,447 --> 00:36:01,615
My lord.

378
00:36:02,449 --> 00:36:03,450
How are you, old friend?

379
00:36:04,368 --> 00:36:06,495
My advance team has secured the city.

380
00:36:06,829 --> 00:36:08,872
We're still smoothing out
a few rough spots.

381
00:36:11,125 --> 00:36:12,209
My lady.

382
00:36:17,005 --> 00:36:18,465
Lisan al-Gaib!

383
00:36:34,815 --> 00:36:37,526
Lisan al-Gaib! Lisan al-Gaib!

384
00:36:38,819 --> 00:36:39,903
Lisan al-Gaib!

385
00:36:40,028 --> 00:36:42,739
Lisan al-Gaib! Lisan al-Gaib!

386
00:36:43,407 --> 00:36:45,742
Lisan al-Gaib! Lisan al-Gaib!

387
00:36:46,493 --> 00:36:48,745
Lisan al-Gaib! Lisan al-Gaib!

388
00:36:49,455 --> 00:36:52,040
Lisan al-Gaib! Lisan al-Gaib!

389
00:36:54,042 --> 00:36:55,752
Don't be fooled by the welcome.

390
00:36:56,044 --> 00:36:57,713
They follow their old masters' rules.

391
00:36:57,796 --> 00:36:58,797
Mandatory attendance.

392
00:36:58,964 --> 00:37:00,757
That's Harkonnen love out there.

393
00:37:07,764 --> 00:37:08,765
Atreides!

394
00:37:08,932 --> 00:37:12,728
Atreides! Atreides! Atreides!

395
00:37:13,061 --> 00:37:16,773
Atreides! Atreides! Atreides!

396
00:37:17,149 --> 00:37:19,151
Atreides! Atreides!

397
00:37:21,778 --> 00:37:23,280
Let's get you out of the sun.

398
00:37:24,364 --> 00:37:26,241
The heat can kill in this place.

399
00:37:43,217 --> 00:37:44,384
They were pointing at us.

400
00:37:45,802 --> 00:37:46,803
What are they shouting?

401
00:37:47,221 --> 00:37:50,933
Lisan al-Gaib.
"Voice from the Outer World."

402
00:37:51,225 --> 00:37:52,643
It's their name for "messiah."

403
00:37:54,228 --> 00:37:56,563
It means the Bene Gesserit
have been at work here.

404
00:37:57,564 --> 00:37:59,233
Planting superstitions.

405
00:37:59,942 --> 00:38:01,902
Preparing the way, Paul.

406
00:38:02,903 --> 00:38:05,155
These people
have waited for centuries

407
00:38:05,239 --> 00:38:06,532
for the Lisan al-Gaib.

408
00:38:07,658 --> 00:38:08,700
They see you,

409
00:38:09,618 --> 00:38:11,036
they see the signs.

410
00:38:14,289 --> 00:38:16,124
They see what they've been
told to see.

411
00:38:21,630 --> 00:38:22,631
We're good to go.

412
00:39:06,258 --> 00:39:07,259
Shield Wall.

413
00:39:07,551 --> 00:39:10,596
Protects the city from the weather
and the worms.

414
00:39:57,934 --> 00:40:00,479
The locals call
the big one the Hand of God.

415
00:40:02,648 --> 00:40:05,025
Well, the Hand of God
is wreaking havoc

416
00:40:05,108 --> 00:40:06,318
on our comms system.

417
00:40:10,030 --> 00:40:11,156
It's so quiet.

418
00:40:12,491 --> 00:40:13,492
Yeah.

419
00:40:14,534 --> 00:40:15,952
That's what worries me, too.

420
00:40:23,168 --> 00:40:24,378
There's the spaceport

421
00:40:25,128 --> 00:40:27,589
and that plume of dust there
is the spice refinery.

422
00:40:27,964 --> 00:40:29,466
Our two most vulnerable points.

423
00:40:29,841 --> 00:40:31,093
I want you guarding them.

424
00:40:31,426 --> 00:40:33,845
If we can't refine spice
and ship it off-world,

425
00:40:34,012 --> 00:40:35,389
- we're dead here.
-  My lord.

426
00:40:36,515 --> 00:40:38,767
The sun's getting too high.
We need to seal the doors.

427
00:40:42,896 --> 00:40:44,773
What do they say
about this hellhole again?

428
00:40:46,149 --> 00:40:48,235
"To shower, you scrub your ass
with sand," my lord.

429
00:40:48,360 --> 00:40:49,653
That's what they say.

430
00:40:49,945 --> 00:40:51,154
That's what they say.

431
00:40:56,284 --> 00:40:57,994
Candidates
for a housekeeper, my lady.

432
00:41:14,845 --> 00:41:15,804
What is your name?

433
00:41:16,430 --> 00:41:17,806
Shadout Mapes, my lady.

434
00:41:20,308 --> 00:41:21,685
The rest of you may go.

435
00:41:22,144 --> 00:41:23,186
Thank you.

436
00:41:25,731 --> 00:41:26,690
Shadout.

437
00:41:27,816 --> 00:41:29,151
It's an old Chakobsa word.

438
00:41:30,277 --> 00:41:31,361
"Well-dipper."

439
00:41:34,364 --> 00:41:35,699
You know the ancient tongues?

440
00:41:35,866 --> 00:41:36,992
I know many things.

441
00:41:37,576 --> 00:41:40,328
I know that you have a weapon
concealed in your bodice.

442
00:41:42,622 --> 00:41:43,790
If you mean to harm me,

443
00:41:44,875 --> 00:41:46,835
I must warn you,
whatever you're hiding,

444
00:41:47,919 --> 00:41:49,212
it won't be enough.

445
00:41:51,465 --> 00:41:53,383
The weapon is meant as a gift

446
00:41:54,843 --> 00:41:56,511
if you are truly The One.

447
00:42:12,652 --> 00:42:13,987
Do you know this?

448
00:42:15,822 --> 00:42:17,199
It's a crysknife.

449
00:42:21,077 --> 00:42:22,245
Do you know its meaning?

450
00:42:26,666 --> 00:42:27,918
It's a maker...

451
00:42:33,590 --> 00:42:35,509
A maker of the deep desert.

452
00:42:38,762 --> 00:42:40,806
When you have lived
with prophecy for so long,

453
00:42:40,972 --> 00:42:43,058
the moment of revelation
is a shock.

454
00:42:43,892 --> 00:42:45,060
Lisan al-Gaib.

455
00:42:45,519 --> 00:42:46,728
The mother and the son.

456
00:42:53,568 --> 00:42:54,778
It is yours.

457
00:42:56,905 --> 00:43:00,116
Tooth of Shai-Hulud.

458
00:43:30,605 --> 00:43:32,566
Lisan! Lisan al-Gaib!

459
00:43:33,775 --> 00:43:37,404
Lisan al-Gaib! Lisan al-Gaib!

460
00:43:47,747 --> 00:43:48,665
Hello.

461
00:43:51,626 --> 00:43:53,587
You shouldn't be out here
at this hour of the day.

462
00:43:56,214 --> 00:43:57,299
They're out here.

463
00:43:58,508 --> 00:44:00,552
Hmm. Fremen pilgrims.

464
00:44:01,553 --> 00:44:03,221
They don't care about heatstroke.

465
00:44:05,307 --> 00:44:07,350
I didn't know date palms
could even be found out here.

466
00:44:08,435 --> 00:44:10,937
Oh, these aren't indigenous.

467
00:44:11,730 --> 00:44:13,273
They can't survive without me.

468
00:44:14,190 --> 00:44:15,191
Each one of these

469
00:44:15,275 --> 00:44:17,611
drinks every day
the equivalent of five men.

470
00:44:20,238 --> 00:44:21,615
Twenty palm trees.

471
00:44:23,074 --> 00:44:24,200
A hundred lives.

472
00:44:25,827 --> 00:44:27,954
Should we remove them?
Save the water?

473
00:44:28,038 --> 00:44:29,080
No, no, no.

474
00:44:29,331 --> 00:44:30,540
These are sacred.

475
00:44:35,337 --> 00:44:36,588
Old dream.

476
00:44:44,930 --> 00:44:46,932
The largest and most dangerous

477
00:44:47,015 --> 00:44:49,893
organism on Arrakis is the sandworm,

478
00:44:50,310 --> 00:44:53,730
capable of reaching
400 meters in length.

479
00:44:54,356 --> 00:44:57,525
To avoid making rhythmic noises,
which attract the sandworms,

480
00:44:58,318 --> 00:45:02,405
the Fremen cross desert spaces
using the sandwalk,

481
00:45:02,530 --> 00:45:05,200
a dance-like motion
with irregular rhythm

482
00:45:05,325 --> 00:45:08,203
which emulates the natural
sounds of the desert.

483
00:45:09,579 --> 00:45:12,123
What scant plant life
exists on Arrakis

484
00:45:12,290 --> 00:45:13,875
is thanks to the Fremen,

485
00:45:13,959 --> 00:45:16,878
who have cultivated
deep-rooted terranic plants

486
00:45:17,170 --> 00:45:19,839
such as saguaro, burrobush,

487
00:45:20,215 --> 00:45:23,510
sand-verbena and incense bush.

488
00:45:24,511 --> 00:45:27,639
The shepherd's tree has
the deepest documented roots,

489
00:45:27,806 --> 00:45:30,517
stretching more than 450 feet deep.

490
00:45:32,227 --> 00:45:34,062
These plants cling to life

491
00:45:34,312 --> 00:45:36,982
in a parched, nutrient-poor landscape.

492
00:46:47,677 --> 00:46:49,054
It's a hunter-seeker.

493
00:46:49,512 --> 00:46:51,014
The operator must be nearby.

494
00:46:56,686 --> 00:46:58,063
The Harkonnen agent
was cemented

495
00:46:58,146 --> 00:46:59,481
into that hole six weeks ago.

496
00:47:00,190 --> 00:47:01,775
Ran the hunter-seeker
through a waterpipe

497
00:47:01,858 --> 00:47:02,776
inside the walls.

498
00:47:04,319 --> 00:47:06,446
Sire, I failed you today.
There's no excuse.

499
00:47:07,363 --> 00:47:08,364
You have my resignation.

500
00:47:08,531 --> 00:47:10,075
You would deprive us
of your talents at this time?

501
00:47:10,450 --> 00:47:11,534
Sire, my honor demands...

502
00:47:11,618 --> 00:47:13,203
They tried to take the life of my son!

503
00:47:14,496 --> 00:47:15,955
I don't give a damn about your honor.

504
00:47:16,122 --> 00:47:18,333
You want absolution?
Go catch some spies.

505
00:47:18,792 --> 00:47:19,793
Your Grace.

506
00:47:27,342 --> 00:47:28,718
The thing must leave.

507
00:47:29,594 --> 00:47:31,137
You can speak without fear.

508
00:47:32,180 --> 00:47:34,349
Our pet doesn't understand
your language.

509
00:47:34,516 --> 00:47:35,850
Get out.

510
00:47:40,396 --> 00:47:41,481
It understands.

511
00:47:42,148 --> 00:47:43,316
Activate silence.

512
00:47:59,082 --> 00:48:00,375
It must never be known.

513
00:48:01,543 --> 00:48:04,003
There's no satellites
over Arrakis.

514
00:48:04,504 --> 00:48:06,714
The Atreides will die in the dark.

515
00:48:08,133 --> 00:48:09,467
On that matter,

516
00:48:10,009 --> 00:48:13,179
Duke Leto Atreides
means nothing to our order.

517
00:48:13,555 --> 00:48:15,014
But his wife is under our protection

518
00:48:15,181 --> 00:48:17,100
and by extension, her son.

519
00:48:18,059 --> 00:48:20,145
Allow them the dignity of exile.

520
00:48:24,691 --> 00:48:26,609
House Harkonnen would never dream

521
00:48:26,693 --> 00:48:29,070
of violating the sanctity of your order.

522
00:48:30,613 --> 00:48:31,948
I give you my word.

523
00:48:32,323 --> 00:48:33,616
We will not harm them.

524
00:48:54,304 --> 00:48:55,680
If the Duke's son lives...

525
00:48:55,972 --> 00:48:58,016
No Atreides will live.

526
00:48:58,558 --> 00:49:00,518
My lord, you gave your word
to the witch.

527
00:49:00,894 --> 00:49:01,978
She sees too much.

528
00:49:02,145 --> 00:49:03,730
I said I would not harm them.

529
00:49:04,063 --> 00:49:05,106
And I shall not.

530
00:49:05,481 --> 00:49:07,233
But Arrakis is Arrakis.

531
00:49:08,818 --> 00:49:10,820
And the desert takes the weak.

532
00:49:13,531 --> 00:49:14,699
My desert.

533
00:49:17,493 --> 00:49:18,953
My Arrakis.

534
00:49:21,539 --> 00:49:22,624
My Dune.

535
00:49:26,377 --> 00:49:28,046
Your first strategy meeting.

536
00:49:28,671 --> 00:49:29,672
Paul Atreides,

537
00:49:29,756 --> 00:49:31,925
who catches hunter-seekers
in his bare hands

538
00:49:32,008 --> 00:49:33,218
like a hero of old.

539
00:49:35,678 --> 00:49:37,430
Thanks
for the humiliation, old man.

540
00:49:38,056 --> 00:49:39,015
Gotta keep an eye on you.

541
00:49:40,058 --> 00:49:41,184
Attention!

542
00:49:49,359 --> 00:49:50,526
Let's get started.

543
00:49:53,238 --> 00:49:54,739
Thufir. Operations.

544
00:49:55,406 --> 00:49:57,700
I secured a copy
of the Harkonnens' account books.

545
00:50:00,286 --> 00:50:01,246
The Harkonnens were taking

546
00:50:01,329 --> 00:50:04,123
10 billion solaris
out of here every year.

547
00:50:05,333 --> 00:50:07,669
"They shall suck
of the abundance of the seas,

548
00:50:08,002 --> 00:50:09,337
and the treasure hid in the sand."

549
00:50:09,629 --> 00:50:11,839
We won't see profits
like that for a while.

550
00:50:12,215 --> 00:50:13,925
Not with the equipment they left us.

551
00:50:15,051 --> 00:50:16,135
How bad is it?

552
00:50:22,558 --> 00:50:24,227
These are spice silos.

553
00:50:25,937 --> 00:50:28,022
We're meant to fill every crate.

554
00:50:29,232 --> 00:50:30,149
All of them?

555
00:50:31,025 --> 00:50:32,986
Every 25 standard days.

556
00:50:34,028 --> 00:50:36,072
Harkonnen sabotage slows us down.

557
00:50:36,447 --> 00:50:37,907
But who's meant to arbitrate?

558
00:50:38,074 --> 00:50:39,200
Isn't there a Judge of the Change

559
00:50:39,284 --> 00:50:40,493
to oversee the transition?

560
00:50:40,868 --> 00:50:41,869
Who did the Emperor appoint?

561
00:50:42,245 --> 00:50:44,831
Dr. Liet Kynes. Imperial Ecologist.

562
00:50:45,290 --> 00:50:46,374
Been here 20 years.

563
00:50:46,958 --> 00:50:48,418
Eccentric, from what I'm told.

564
00:50:48,835 --> 00:50:50,837
I want to see these
harvesting fields myself.

565
00:50:51,921 --> 00:50:52,964
I wouldn't recommend it, my lord.

566
00:50:53,464 --> 00:50:55,508
Have this Judge of the Change
accompany us.

567
00:50:55,925 --> 00:50:57,176
A meeting's long overdue.

568
00:50:57,593 --> 00:50:59,470
And we'll get a bit
of Imperial protection.

569
00:50:59,721 --> 00:51:01,139
A hostage.

570
00:51:01,264 --> 00:51:02,265
I love it.

571
00:51:02,515 --> 00:51:03,391
Hmm.

572
00:51:03,474 --> 00:51:05,643
- He's here, my lord.

573
00:51:30,168 --> 00:51:31,669
Take care of them.
They are friends.

574
00:51:32,003 --> 00:51:33,004
Duncan!

575
00:51:33,296 --> 00:51:34,464
Ah! My boy!

576
00:51:40,094 --> 00:51:41,220
I swear you're getting taller.

577
00:51:41,304 --> 00:51:42,597
Well, you smell much worse.

578
00:51:47,226 --> 00:51:48,686
For four weeks, I lived with the Fremen.

579
00:51:49,103 --> 00:51:51,147
Hidden in the desert,
in a community called a sietch.

580
00:51:51,981 --> 00:51:54,567
Stilgar, the leader of that sietch,
has come with me to meet you, sire.

581
00:51:55,360 --> 00:51:57,195
This sietch, how is it hidden?

582
00:51:57,528 --> 00:51:58,446
It's underground.

583
00:51:58,863 --> 00:52:00,239
Arrakis is filled with caverns.

584
00:52:00,615 --> 00:52:01,657
How big was the place?

585
00:52:02,575 --> 00:52:03,743
I'd say 10,000 people.

586
00:52:05,036 --> 00:52:06,204
And there are hundreds of sietches.

587
00:52:07,622 --> 00:52:09,123
Millions of Fremen.

588
00:52:09,916 --> 00:52:10,917
You were right.

589
00:52:11,042 --> 00:52:14,420
The Harkonnen estimate
was 50,000 on the whole planet.

590
00:52:15,046 --> 00:52:16,756
The Fremen watched me
search for them for days.

591
00:52:17,215 --> 00:52:18,257
I never saw them.

592
00:52:19,008 --> 00:52:20,718
Finally, they sent
a warrior out to kill me.

593
00:52:21,719 --> 00:52:22,637
And I gotta tell you,

594
00:52:23,429 --> 00:52:25,014
I have never come so close to dying.

595
00:52:25,932 --> 00:52:27,600
There's no finer fighter
in the Imperium.

596
00:52:28,643 --> 00:52:29,811
They fight like demons.

597
00:52:30,436 --> 00:52:31,604
Desert power.

598
00:52:34,482 --> 00:52:35,525
Duncan.

599
00:52:36,484 --> 00:52:37,902
- Well done.
- Thank you, my lord.

600
00:52:37,985 --> 00:52:38,986
Sire.

601
00:52:39,695 --> 00:52:41,572
Their leader has a knife
he won't surrender, sire.

602
00:52:42,240 --> 00:52:44,450
It's a crysknife.
It's sacred to his people.

603
00:52:45,118 --> 00:52:46,119
Let him pass.

604
00:53:02,802 --> 00:53:03,761
Stop there.

605
00:53:04,554 --> 00:53:05,930
Hey! Hey!

606
00:53:09,600 --> 00:53:10,601
Mm.

607
00:53:11,477 --> 00:53:12,603
Stilgar.

608
00:53:13,563 --> 00:53:14,730
Welcome.

609
00:53:16,274 --> 00:53:18,401
Sir, I respect the personal dignity

610
00:53:18,484 --> 00:53:19,902
of any man that respects mine.

611
00:53:23,531 --> 00:53:24,532
Hmm.

612
00:53:27,869 --> 00:53:28,870
Hold.

613
00:53:30,788 --> 00:53:32,248
Thank you, Stilgar,

614
00:53:32,790 --> 00:53:35,418
for the gift of your body's moisture.

615
00:53:36,502 --> 00:53:38,337
We accept it in the spirit
in which it was given.

616
00:53:46,596 --> 00:53:47,597
I'm glad you've come.

617
00:53:48,681 --> 00:53:50,141
I believe your people and mine

618
00:53:50,683 --> 00:53:51,893
have much to offer one another.

619
00:53:52,018 --> 00:53:53,311
No, no, you are Outworlders.

620
00:53:53,478 --> 00:53:55,062
You come here for the spice,

621
00:53:55,146 --> 00:53:57,190
you take it, giving nothing in return.

622
00:53:59,400 --> 00:54:00,401
That's true.

623
00:54:02,695 --> 00:54:05,239
I know you've suffered
at the hands of the Harkonnen.

624
00:54:06,532 --> 00:54:07,617
Name what you want.

625
00:54:08,075 --> 00:54:10,203
If it's in my power to grant,
I'll give it and ask for nothing.

626
00:54:10,328 --> 00:54:13,539
Mm. I ask for this.
Do not seek our sietches.

627
00:54:13,623 --> 00:54:16,250
Do not trespass in our lands.

628
00:54:16,959 --> 00:54:19,962
The desert was ours
long before you came.

629
00:54:20,129 --> 00:54:22,965
So, come and dig your spice,
but when you have it,

630
00:54:23,049 --> 00:54:25,426
go back to this side of the Shield Wall

631
00:54:25,593 --> 00:54:27,512
and leave the desert to the Fremen.

632
00:54:27,678 --> 00:54:30,264
You will address the Duke
as "my lord" or "sire."

633
00:54:30,348 --> 00:54:32,099
Gurney, just...
just a moment.

634
00:54:33,017 --> 00:54:34,185
The Emperor

635
00:54:34,560 --> 00:54:36,938
has given me Arrakis as my fief

636
00:54:37,438 --> 00:54:38,731
to rule and protect.

637
00:54:39,273 --> 00:54:41,400
I cannot promise
not to travel into the desert

638
00:54:41,567 --> 00:54:43,152
if duty compels me.

639
00:54:44,737 --> 00:54:46,614
But your sietches will be yours forever.

640
00:54:47,990 --> 00:54:49,992
And you will never be hunted
while I govern here.

641
00:54:54,830 --> 00:54:56,040
That's very honorable.

642
00:54:57,041 --> 00:54:59,293
I must go. That's all
I have to say to you.

643
00:54:59,502 --> 00:55:00,461
Won't you stay?

644
00:55:01,462 --> 00:55:02,505
We would honor you.

645
00:55:03,339 --> 00:55:05,550
Honor requires that I be elsewhere.

646
00:55:17,853 --> 00:55:18,896
I don't like him.

647
00:55:19,230 --> 00:55:21,232
Our plan bears fruit.

648
00:55:21,524 --> 00:55:22,650
But it will take time?

649
00:55:23,109 --> 00:55:24,068
Yes.

650
00:55:25,236 --> 00:55:27,113
It will take time.

651
00:55:30,241 --> 00:55:31,450
Here, this is for you.

652
00:55:35,621 --> 00:55:36,664
It's a paracompass.

653
00:55:37,832 --> 00:55:39,917
The moons here
have a magnetic field, so...

654
00:55:40,418 --> 00:55:41,961
a simple compass needle
won't point north.

655
00:55:43,254 --> 00:55:44,964
Takes a clever piece
of clockwork to sort it out.

656
00:55:45,339 --> 00:55:46,507
The Fremen make these?

657
00:55:47,341 --> 00:55:48,801
And stillsuits, and sand compactors,

658
00:55:48,884 --> 00:55:50,136
and all kinds of ingenious things.

659
00:55:50,469 --> 00:55:52,179
What the hell
is a sand compactor?

660
00:55:54,724 --> 00:55:55,725
That's a sand compactor.

661
00:55:57,184 --> 00:55:59,270
My God, man, you've gone native.

662
00:55:59,895 --> 00:56:00,855
You admire them.

663
00:56:02,523 --> 00:56:03,441
I do.

664
00:56:04,317 --> 00:56:06,027
They're fierce but loyal.

665
00:56:06,902 --> 00:56:08,112
They're attuned to the desert.

666
00:56:08,696 --> 00:56:09,572
Part of it.

667
00:56:10,156 --> 00:56:11,157
It's part of them.

668
00:56:12,366 --> 00:56:13,284
You wait till you see it.

669
00:56:14,368 --> 00:56:15,328
It's beautiful out there.

670
00:56:19,040 --> 00:56:20,750
Sunrise warning,
all workers.

671
00:56:21,167 --> 00:56:23,711
Temperature today
will reach 140 degrees.

672
00:56:23,878 --> 00:56:25,755
We are currently 90 degrees,

673
00:56:25,838 --> 00:56:28,966
and in 10 minutes,
we will hit 120 degrees.

674
00:56:30,134 --> 00:56:31,385
Last warning call.

675
00:57:05,294 --> 00:57:06,754
The Judge of the Change, sire.

676
00:57:07,380 --> 00:57:08,422
Dr. Liet Kynes.

677
00:57:09,173 --> 00:57:10,341
My lord Duke.

678
00:57:11,592 --> 00:57:12,593
Welcome to Arrakis.

679
00:57:13,427 --> 00:57:14,804
You're the Imperial Ecologist.

680
00:57:15,471 --> 00:57:16,847
Thank you for the stillsuits.

681
00:57:17,431 --> 00:57:18,724
They are of Fremen make.

682
00:57:19,392 --> 00:57:20,226
The best.

683
00:57:20,559 --> 00:57:21,769
With your permission, sire,

684
00:57:21,852 --> 00:57:23,104
I must check
the integrity of your suit...

685
00:57:23,688 --> 00:57:24,730
Whoa.

686
00:57:25,189 --> 00:57:26,190
It's all right.

687
00:57:28,401 --> 00:57:29,443
It's all right.

688
00:57:30,319 --> 00:57:33,698
Dr. Kynes,
we're in your hands.

689
00:57:38,661 --> 00:57:42,790
A stillsuit is a high-efficiency
filtration system.

690
00:57:43,999 --> 00:57:45,543
Even this early in the morning,

691
00:57:45,710 --> 00:57:48,045
you wouldn't survive two hours
without one of these.

692
00:57:49,338 --> 00:57:50,297
It cools the body

693
00:57:51,841 --> 00:57:54,176
and recycles
the water lost to sweat.

694
00:57:55,720 --> 00:57:57,972
Your body's movements
provide the power.

695
00:57:59,014 --> 00:58:00,349
Inside the mask, you'll find a tube

696
00:58:00,433 --> 00:58:02,685
to allow you to drink
the recycled water.

697
00:58:02,810 --> 00:58:03,811
Mm.

698
00:58:03,936 --> 00:58:05,396
In good working order,
your suit won't lose

699
00:58:05,479 --> 00:58:07,273
more than a thimbleful of water a day.

700
00:58:07,940 --> 00:58:08,858
Most impressive.

701
00:58:11,193 --> 00:58:12,278
Let's have a look at you, lad.

702
00:58:14,780 --> 00:58:15,823
You've...

703
00:58:16,449 --> 00:58:17,450
worn a stillsuit before?

704
00:58:17,533 --> 00:58:18,659
No, this is my first time.

705
00:58:21,579 --> 00:58:24,165
Your desert boots are fitted
slip-fashion at the ankles.

706
00:58:24,290 --> 00:58:25,291
Who taught you to do that?

707
00:58:26,167 --> 00:58:27,293
It seemed the right way.

708
00:58:35,634 --> 00:58:36,677
Are you Fremen?

709
00:58:38,763 --> 00:58:41,640
I am accepted
in both sietch and village.

710
00:58:42,767 --> 00:58:47,646
Now, come and see the spice sands
on which your livelihood depends.

711
00:59:26,101 --> 00:59:27,019
What would you do

712
00:59:27,102 --> 00:59:28,646
if your ornithopter went down out here?

713
00:59:29,396 --> 00:59:30,856
You wouldn't want
to go down out there.

714
00:59:31,857 --> 00:59:32,858
It's worm territory.

715
00:59:35,778 --> 00:59:36,779
Dust cloud.

716
00:59:37,822 --> 00:59:38,823
I see it.

717
00:59:40,783 --> 00:59:42,326
That's one of your harvesters.

718
01:00:08,435 --> 01:00:09,520
You can see the spice

719
01:00:09,603 --> 01:00:10,729
scattered over the surface.

720
01:00:12,940 --> 01:00:14,316
A rich spice bed

721
01:00:15,025 --> 01:00:16,277
by the color.

722
01:00:16,443 --> 01:00:18,779
If you get a little higher,
you'll have a better view.

723
01:00:33,961 --> 01:00:36,255
You see these spotter aircraft
looking for wormsign.

724
01:00:38,299 --> 01:00:39,300
Wormsign?

725
01:00:39,842 --> 01:00:41,802
A sand wave
moving toward the crawler.

726
01:00:42,428 --> 01:00:44,388
Worms travel deep but get closer

727
01:00:44,471 --> 01:00:45,723
to the surface when they attack.

728
01:00:46,765 --> 01:00:48,017
If you are patient,

729
01:00:49,226 --> 01:00:50,394
we should see one.

730
01:00:51,312 --> 01:00:52,479
A worm always comes?

731
01:00:52,813 --> 01:00:55,232
Always. They're drawn
by rhythmic noises.

732
01:00:55,858 --> 01:00:57,359
Why don't we just
shield the crawlers?

733
01:00:57,860 --> 01:00:59,987
A shield's a death sentence
in the desert.

734
01:01:00,487 --> 01:01:01,614
It attracts the worms

735
01:01:01,739 --> 01:01:03,991
and drives them into a killing frenzy.

736
01:01:06,869 --> 01:01:07,870
Is that a worm?

737
01:01:20,299 --> 01:01:21,383
Big one.

738
01:01:22,217 --> 01:01:23,344
You have good eyes.

739
01:01:24,720 --> 01:01:26,639
Calling crawler Delta Ajax niner.

740
01:01:27,014 --> 01:01:28,641
Wormsign warning. Acknowledge.

741
01:01:29,558 --> 01:01:31,644
Who calls Delta Ajax niner?

742
01:01:32,144 --> 01:01:33,145
Over.

743
01:01:33,228 --> 01:01:34,688
They seem pretty calm about it.

744
01:01:34,855 --> 01:01:35,981
Unlisted flight.

745
01:01:36,273 --> 01:01:37,274
Imperium business.

746
01:01:37,566 --> 01:01:39,443
Wormsign north and east of you.

747
01:01:39,902 --> 01:01:41,236
3.7 kilometers.

748
01:01:41,820 --> 01:01:43,155
Delta Ajax niner,

749
01:01:43,238 --> 01:01:45,074
this is Spotter One.
Wormsign confirmed.

750
01:01:46,575 --> 01:01:48,327
Stand by for contact fix.

751
01:01:52,539 --> 01:01:54,875
Worm is on intercept course
to your position.

752
01:01:55,042 --> 01:01:56,543
Contact in five minutes.

753
01:01:56,710 --> 01:01:58,295
So, what happens now?

754
01:01:58,712 --> 01:02:00,714
They'll call a carryall
to lift the crawler.

755
01:02:01,465 --> 01:02:03,258
They'll harvest right up
to the last minute.

756
01:02:03,550 --> 01:02:05,010
Calling carryall Alpha Zero.

757
01:02:05,177 --> 01:02:06,637
Ready for docking sequence.

758
01:02:07,096 --> 01:02:09,181
Contact five minutes. Over.

759
01:02:14,186 --> 01:02:15,938
Anybody got a visual
on the carryall?

760
01:02:20,526 --> 01:02:21,527
There it is.

761
01:02:21,610 --> 01:02:23,153
This is carryall Alpha Zero

762
01:02:23,237 --> 01:02:24,571
to Delta Ajax niner.

763
01:02:25,906 --> 01:02:27,241
Approaching from your east.

764
01:02:28,075 --> 01:02:30,786
Correcting altitude
and preparing docking equipment.

765
01:02:30,953 --> 01:02:33,831
Copy, Alpha Zero.
Initiating docking sequence.

766
01:02:36,625 --> 01:02:37,668
T-5.

767
01:02:37,835 --> 01:02:38,836
Copy that.

768
01:02:39,003 --> 01:02:40,462
Prepare to be airborne
in 30 seconds.

769
01:02:40,629 --> 01:02:43,215
Docking sequence initiated.
Brace yourselves.

770
01:02:46,552 --> 01:02:48,762
Alpha Zero, we're short
one point of contact.

771
01:02:49,096 --> 01:02:50,347
What is going on?

772
01:02:50,514 --> 01:02:52,349
It's one of the anchors.
It's dead.

773
01:02:53,559 --> 01:02:54,601
Shit.

774
01:02:55,185 --> 01:02:57,187
Carryall unable to proceed.

775
01:02:57,271 --> 01:02:59,023
Unable to lift without that anchor.

776
01:02:59,189 --> 01:03:00,899
All call! All call!

777
01:03:01,358 --> 01:03:03,485
Any carryall in the sector,
please respond!

778
01:03:04,111 --> 01:03:05,988
Spotter One,
give us an update. Over.

779
01:03:06,071 --> 01:03:07,031
Hydraulics are dead.

780
01:03:07,114 --> 01:03:08,198
We won't make it.
You have to evacuate.

781
01:03:08,282 --> 01:03:09,324
Contact in four minutes.

782
01:03:09,408 --> 01:03:10,409
Try it again!

783
01:03:10,492 --> 01:03:11,535
How many men on that crawler?

784
01:03:12,036 --> 01:03:12,911
Crew of 21.

785
01:03:13,328 --> 01:03:14,580
Our ships can take six each.

786
01:03:14,747 --> 01:03:15,789
That's still three short.

787
01:03:16,540 --> 01:03:17,541
We'll find a way.

788
01:03:29,845 --> 01:03:31,680
This is Duke Leto Atreides.

789
01:03:32,473 --> 01:03:35,517
We're coming down to extract
the crew of Delta Ajax niner.

790
01:03:36,018 --> 01:03:37,144
We'll set down on the west.

791
01:03:48,489 --> 01:03:50,115
Shield generators
weigh 100 kilos each.

792
01:03:50,908 --> 01:03:51,909
Yes, Gurney,

793
01:03:51,992 --> 01:03:53,660
have our escorts throw out
the shield generators.

794
01:03:53,952 --> 01:03:54,953
Yes, sire.

795
01:03:55,037 --> 01:03:56,872
And, Paul, I want you
at the back of the thopter.

796
01:03:57,039 --> 01:03:58,040
Guide them in.

797
01:03:58,207 --> 01:03:59,500
Delta Ajax niner,

798
01:03:59,583 --> 01:04:01,835
put seven men each in my ships now.

799
01:05:00,477 --> 01:05:01,854
Contact in two minutes.

800
01:05:04,773 --> 01:05:06,984
Getting close, guys.
We better abandon ship now.

801
01:05:09,653 --> 01:05:10,654
Where are they?

802
01:05:10,821 --> 01:05:13,157
Sir, there's protocol
for a reason.

803
01:05:13,323 --> 01:05:15,534
If we take one step out there,
we're as good as dead.

804
01:05:16,118 --> 01:05:17,744
Besides, we've got a full load of spice.

805
01:05:17,828 --> 01:05:19,496
- We can't just leave it.
- Damn the spice!

806
01:05:20,164 --> 01:05:22,207
I want every man off that crawler now!

807
01:05:36,221 --> 01:05:37,222
Hey!

808
01:05:37,514 --> 01:05:38,515
Hey!

809
01:05:38,891 --> 01:05:40,726
Seven over here, seven over there.

810
01:05:43,395 --> 01:05:45,063
Go! Go! Go!

811
01:06:00,829 --> 01:06:03,165
Kwisatz Haderach.

812
01:06:16,595 --> 01:06:20,057
Kwisatz Haderach awakes.

813
01:06:29,566 --> 01:06:30,901
Hurry! Get on!

814
01:06:39,743 --> 01:06:40,744
It's here!

815
01:06:43,789 --> 01:06:44,790
Paul!

816
01:06:47,292 --> 01:06:48,293
Paul!

817
01:06:52,339 --> 01:06:55,550
I recognize
your footsteps, old man.

818
01:06:56,426 --> 01:06:57,427
Get up!

819
01:06:58,136 --> 01:06:59,137
Let's go!

820
01:07:00,722 --> 01:07:02,724
What's the matter with you?
Come on! Let's go!

821
01:07:03,350 --> 01:07:04,351
Run!

822
01:07:30,419 --> 01:07:31,420
Hey!

823
01:07:50,063 --> 01:07:51,481
Bless the Maker and His Water.

824
01:07:52,607 --> 01:07:54,526
Bless the coming and going of Him.

825
01:07:54,985 --> 01:07:57,154
May His passage cleanse the world

826
01:07:57,863 --> 01:07:59,740
and keep the world for His people.

827
01:08:24,014 --> 01:08:25,015
Hey!

828
01:08:25,098 --> 01:08:27,517
- You cannot take such risks.
-  Yes, sir.

829
01:08:27,601 --> 01:08:28,602
You have responsibilities.

830
01:08:28,685 --> 01:08:29,978
I... I'm sorry, sir.
It won't happen again.

831
01:08:30,062 --> 01:08:30,979
Go.

832
01:08:31,938 --> 01:08:32,898
Dr. Kynes.

833
01:08:35,233 --> 01:08:36,276
You saw it.

834
01:08:36,943 --> 01:08:38,779
With your own eyes. It's plain to see.

835
01:08:38,945 --> 01:08:41,031
Everything they've left us
is in shambles.

836
01:08:41,573 --> 01:08:42,574
We've been set up to fail.

837
01:08:43,533 --> 01:08:45,243
That carryall was just old.

838
01:08:46,453 --> 01:08:48,372
The desert isn't kind to equipment.

839
01:08:50,207 --> 01:08:51,500
You know what will happen

840
01:08:51,958 --> 01:08:54,044
if I don't get spice
production back on track.

841
01:08:56,505 --> 01:08:59,257
I'm not here to take your part.

842
01:09:00,342 --> 01:09:03,929
Arrakis has seen men like you
come and go.

843
01:09:06,932 --> 01:09:10,519
Take good care of your family.

844
01:09:13,939 --> 01:09:16,316
The desert's not kind
to humans either.

845
01:09:33,708 --> 01:09:35,961
Spice is a psychoactive chemical.

846
01:09:37,838 --> 01:09:39,464
You seem to be sensitive.

847
01:09:43,927 --> 01:09:44,928
You'll be fine.

848
01:09:46,680 --> 01:09:48,306
Thank you, Dr. Yueh.

849
01:09:58,358 --> 01:10:00,152
That wasn't an allergic reaction.

850
01:10:02,571 --> 01:10:03,780
I had a vision.

851
01:10:06,867 --> 01:10:08,326
My eyes were wide open.

852
01:10:10,412 --> 01:10:11,413
What did you see?

853
01:10:49,242 --> 01:10:52,579
Kwisatz Haderach.

854
01:10:53,038 --> 01:10:55,332
You can see.

855
01:11:37,582 --> 01:11:38,833
It's confusing.

856
01:11:39,251 --> 01:11:40,418
I thought I saw my death,

857
01:11:40,585 --> 01:11:41,878
only it wasn't.

858
01:11:43,296 --> 01:11:46,508
I know a knife is important, somehow.

859
01:11:49,010 --> 01:11:50,887
Someone will hand me a blade,

860
01:11:51,638 --> 01:11:54,766
but I don't know who,
or when, or where.

861
01:11:57,352 --> 01:12:00,021
Some things, though, are crystal clear.

862
01:12:00,146 --> 01:12:01,147
I can feel it.

863
01:12:06,403 --> 01:12:07,529
I know you're pregnant.

864
01:12:13,743 --> 01:12:15,036
You can't know that.

865
01:12:17,038 --> 01:12:18,164
I barely know that.

866
01:12:18,331 --> 01:12:19,916
It's only been a few weeks.

867
01:13:11,426 --> 01:13:12,636
Atreides legions

868
01:13:12,719 --> 01:13:14,220
are the finest in the Imperium.

869
01:13:15,180 --> 01:13:17,557
Trained by Gurney Halleck
and Duncan Idaho.

870
01:13:25,940 --> 01:13:27,317
Just so.

871
01:13:28,485 --> 01:13:29,736
Three battalions.

872
01:13:30,070 --> 01:13:31,154
As agreed.

873
01:14:11,903 --> 01:14:13,780
There is something
you need to know about Paul.

874
01:14:14,280 --> 01:14:15,156
No.

875
01:14:15,949 --> 01:14:17,367
Don't think I want to know.

876
01:14:18,618 --> 01:14:20,370
Ever since you brought him
before your Reverend Mother,

877
01:14:20,537 --> 01:14:21,830
he hasn't been the same.

878
01:14:23,998 --> 01:14:25,125
He's distracted.

879
01:14:27,335 --> 01:14:30,046
Jessica, you gave me a son.

880
01:14:30,588 --> 01:14:31,840
And from the moment he was born,

881
01:14:31,923 --> 01:14:33,717
I never questioned you.

882
01:14:33,883 --> 01:14:35,593
I trusted you completely.

883
01:14:36,636 --> 01:14:38,263
Even when you walked in shadows.

884
01:14:39,806 --> 01:14:41,516
Now I'm asking you this one thing.

885
01:14:44,352 --> 01:14:45,645
If anything happens...

886
01:14:47,731 --> 01:14:48,898
will you protect our son?

887
01:14:50,817 --> 01:14:52,235
With my life.

888
01:14:52,318 --> 01:14:54,529
I'm not asking his mother.
I'm asking the Bene Gesserit.

889
01:14:59,242 --> 01:15:00,368
Will you protect Paul?

890
01:15:06,833 --> 01:15:08,501
Why are you having these thoughts?

891
01:15:15,216 --> 01:15:17,177
Leto, this is not you.

892
01:15:23,391 --> 01:15:25,018
I thought we'd have more time.

893
01:15:44,788 --> 01:15:46,581
Have a good night,
Master Paul.

894
01:15:47,499 --> 01:15:48,875
Good night, Dr. Yueh.

895
01:15:58,760 --> 01:15:59,969
You need to sleep.

896
01:16:01,638 --> 01:16:02,847
No.

897
01:16:03,139 --> 01:16:04,265
Not like that.

898
01:16:20,114 --> 01:16:21,616
I should have married you.

899
01:17:40,528 --> 01:17:41,905
Hawat. Security.

900
01:17:44,574 --> 01:17:45,658
Security.

901
01:18:48,972 --> 01:18:50,223
Sir. Sir.

902
01:18:51,599 --> 01:18:52,809
The shield's come down.

903
01:19:02,402 --> 01:19:03,403
God in heaven.

904
01:19:04,320 --> 01:19:06,572
Get everything with guns
off the ground! Go!

905
01:19:51,242 --> 01:19:52,410
Go! Go! Go!

906
01:20:54,972 --> 01:20:56,891
With me! With me!

907
01:21:26,045 --> 01:21:27,046
Atreides!

908
01:21:27,255 --> 01:21:28,256
Atreides!

909
01:21:57,451 --> 01:21:59,287
-  Sardaukar!
-  Sardaukar!

910
01:22:22,602 --> 01:22:23,978
I'm sorry, my lord.

911
01:22:27,273 --> 01:22:29,483
But I've made a bargain
with the Baron.

912
01:22:32,612 --> 01:22:33,613
Why?

913
01:22:34,530 --> 01:22:35,948
I had no choice.

914
01:22:37,033 --> 01:22:38,910
The Harkonnens have my wife, Wanna.

915
01:22:40,870 --> 01:22:42,872
They take her apart like a doll.

916
01:22:44,165 --> 01:22:45,541
I will buy her freedom.

917
01:22:46,334 --> 01:22:47,418
And you are the price.

918
01:22:51,339 --> 01:22:54,133
For Paul. I will do what I can.

919
01:22:54,967 --> 01:22:56,260
And you

920
01:22:56,844 --> 01:22:58,179
will kill a man for me.

921
01:23:03,184 --> 01:23:06,354
I'm going to replace your peg tooth.

922
01:23:06,854 --> 01:23:10,316
If you bite down hard,
this tooth will crush.

923
01:23:12,068 --> 01:23:15,488
Breathe out, and you will
fill the air with poison.

924
01:23:16,405 --> 01:23:18,074
It will be your last breath.

925
01:23:19,033 --> 01:23:20,910
But if you choose your moment well,

926
01:23:22,620 --> 01:23:24,288
it will also be the Baron's.

927
01:24:58,549 --> 01:24:59,633
Paul.

928
01:26:22,591 --> 01:26:23,717
To hell, dogs!

929
01:27:59,730 --> 01:28:01,815
I've never had a highborn.

930
01:28:04,693 --> 01:28:05,694
You?

931
01:28:06,237 --> 01:28:07,738
Bene Gesserit ain't all highborn.

932
01:28:08,739 --> 01:28:10,741
She's highborn
enough for me.

933
01:28:12,284 --> 01:28:14,078
Let's feed the kid to the worms.

934
01:28:14,620 --> 01:28:16,372
And give her a long goodbye.

935
01:28:16,664 --> 01:28:18,499
Don't you dare touch my mother.

936
01:28:19,917 --> 01:28:20,876
Don't talk.

937
01:28:32,638 --> 01:28:33,889
Remove her gag.

938
01:28:43,357 --> 01:28:44,441
Shut up.

939
01:29:13,679 --> 01:29:15,014
Remove her gag.

940
01:29:21,270 --> 01:29:22,271
Kill him.

941
01:29:31,363 --> 01:29:32,406
Set us free.

942
01:29:46,045 --> 01:29:47,004
Stop!

943
01:29:47,713 --> 01:29:48,839
Cut the rope.

944
01:29:51,717 --> 01:29:52,718
Give me the knife.

945
01:30:01,977 --> 01:30:04,563
Your pitch was too forced.

946
01:30:12,863 --> 01:30:14,073
It's a fremkit.

947
01:30:27,419 --> 01:30:28,462
They've crippled the ship.

948
01:31:40,951 --> 01:31:41,952
Mmm.

949
01:32:00,929 --> 01:32:01,930
Ah.

950
01:32:04,099 --> 01:32:06,351
You have a wonderful kitchen, cousin.

951
01:32:25,370 --> 01:32:27,080
This is Dr. Yueh's handwriting.

952
01:32:28,332 --> 01:32:30,209
"If anyone makes it out
of Arrakeen alive,

953
01:32:30,751 --> 01:32:32,544
there's an Atreides beacon
in the fremkit.

954
01:32:33,128 --> 01:32:34,713
God willing,
they'll be able to find you."

955
01:32:43,138 --> 01:32:44,139
My lord Baron.

956
01:32:45,557 --> 01:32:46,725
Dr. Yueh.

957
01:32:46,892 --> 01:32:48,060
The traitor.

958
01:32:49,728 --> 01:32:50,813
What do you want?

959
01:32:52,064 --> 01:32:53,524
I jammed their comms

960
01:32:54,441 --> 01:32:55,943
and lowered their shields.

961
01:32:56,443 --> 01:32:57,486
Hmm.

962
01:32:57,569 --> 01:32:59,696
I delivered
the Duke and his family.

963
01:33:00,239 --> 01:33:01,865
The bargain to the letter.

964
01:33:02,783 --> 01:33:03,909
And what was I to do for you?

965
01:33:05,410 --> 01:33:07,412
Deliver my wife from her agony.

966
01:33:09,414 --> 01:33:10,415
Yes.

967
01:33:44,116 --> 01:33:45,576
I said I'd set her free.

968
01:33:46,660 --> 01:33:47,911
That you could join her.

969
01:33:52,791 --> 01:33:53,917
So, join her.

970
01:34:03,635 --> 01:34:05,137
What do you think is next?

971
01:34:09,600 --> 01:34:10,726
It's a thumper.

972
01:34:11,685 --> 01:34:12,769
No stillsuits.

973
01:34:13,437 --> 01:34:15,022
The one thing we actually need.

974
01:34:20,402 --> 01:34:23,238
For hundreds of years,
we've traded blood for blood.

975
01:34:24,907 --> 01:34:25,949
But no more.

976
01:34:28,493 --> 01:34:31,204
Your son is dead.
Your concubine is dead.

977
01:34:32,497 --> 01:34:34,833
Tonight the House of Atreides falls.

978
01:34:38,045 --> 01:34:40,255
And your bloodline ends forever.

979
01:34:54,311 --> 01:34:55,312
What did you say?

980
01:35:05,322 --> 01:35:06,698
Here I am...

981
01:35:08,241 --> 01:35:09,660
here I remain.

982
01:36:53,055 --> 01:36:54,056
Kynes!

983
01:36:55,891 --> 01:36:57,434
It's not safe for you here.

984
01:36:57,601 --> 01:36:58,727
Will you tell
the Great Houses

985
01:36:58,810 --> 01:37:00,312
of the Landsraad
how we were betrayed?

986
01:37:00,896 --> 01:37:02,397
How the best of them were murdered?

987
01:37:03,398 --> 01:37:05,400
I am commanded to say nothing.

988
01:37:06,985 --> 01:37:08,320
To see nothing.

989
01:37:10,530 --> 01:37:12,157
The Emperor sent us here to die.

990
01:38:01,331 --> 01:38:02,624
There's spice in the tent.

991
01:39:29,336 --> 01:39:31,213
That's the future. It's coming.

992
01:39:46,686 --> 01:39:48,647
Holy war spreading across the universe

993
01:39:48,730 --> 01:39:50,106
like unquenchable fire.

994
01:40:03,203 --> 01:40:04,996
Paul, you're scared. I can see it.

995
01:40:06,164 --> 01:40:07,749
Tell me, please, what do you fear?

996
01:40:18,426 --> 01:40:20,303
Somebody help me, please.

997
01:40:21,346 --> 01:40:22,514
Paul.

998
01:40:24,808 --> 01:40:25,809
It's coming.

999
01:40:26,685 --> 01:40:28,144
I see a holy war spreading

1000
01:40:28,228 --> 01:40:29,896
across the universe
like unquenchable fire.

1001
01:40:30,438 --> 01:40:33,149
A warrior religion
that waves the Atreides banner

1002
01:40:33,233 --> 01:40:34,359
in my father's name.

1003
01:40:34,442 --> 01:40:35,443
Paul.

1004
01:40:35,527 --> 01:40:37,070
Fanatical legions worshipping

1005
01:40:37,445 --> 01:40:38,989
at the shrine of my father's skull.

1006
01:40:40,240 --> 01:40:42,075
A war in my name!

1007
01:40:42,909 --> 01:40:44,536
Everyone's shouting my name!

1008
01:40:44,661 --> 01:40:45,662
Paul.

1009
01:40:49,332 --> 01:40:50,709
Paul Atreides.

1010
01:40:51,668 --> 01:40:54,504
You are your father's son.
You are my son.

1011
01:40:54,671 --> 01:40:57,132
You are the Duke Paul Atreides.

1012
01:40:58,300 --> 01:41:01,052
You know who you are.
You know who you are.

1013
01:41:01,136 --> 01:41:02,137
Get off me!

1014
01:41:04,222 --> 01:41:05,557
You did this to me!

1015
01:41:05,932 --> 01:41:08,184
You Bene Gesserit made me a freak!

1016
01:41:33,668 --> 01:41:35,128
My father is dead.

1017
01:42:12,540 --> 01:42:13,917
Someone's near.

1018
01:42:14,918 --> 01:42:16,336
You need to drink.

1019
01:42:18,129 --> 01:42:19,964
It's recycled water from the tent.

1020
01:42:28,223 --> 01:42:29,557
Sweat and tears.

1021
01:42:33,603 --> 01:42:34,938
All right, let's get out of here.

1022
01:43:48,761 --> 01:43:49,888
That's Duncan.

1023
01:44:00,398 --> 01:44:01,566
My lady.

1024
01:44:01,733 --> 01:44:02,734
Paul.

1025
01:44:03,485 --> 01:44:05,278
I'm so sorry. Your father...

1026
01:44:05,653 --> 01:44:06,779
We know.

1027
01:44:08,823 --> 01:44:09,991
My lord Duke.

1028
01:44:23,588 --> 01:44:24,589
Here.

1029
01:44:26,716 --> 01:44:27,800
Drink this.

1030
01:44:35,683 --> 01:44:37,393
Harkonnens hit
every population center

1031
01:44:37,477 --> 01:44:38,811
on the planet at once.

1032
01:44:39,229 --> 01:44:41,648
There must have been
ten legions, hundreds of ships.

1033
01:44:41,814 --> 01:44:43,066
There were Sardaukar with them.

1034
01:44:43,942 --> 01:44:45,860
- At least two battalions.
- What? Are you sure?

1035
01:44:46,528 --> 01:44:48,196
You cross swords with a Sardaukar,

1036
01:44:49,197 --> 01:44:50,198
you know it.

1037
01:44:50,698 --> 01:44:53,743
So, the Emperor's taken a side.

1038
01:44:55,578 --> 01:44:57,247
What says
the Judge of the Change?

1039
01:44:58,915 --> 01:45:00,833
The Emperor forbids me
from saying anything at all.

1040
01:45:01,000 --> 01:45:02,752
And yet you risk your life
to help us.

1041
01:45:23,314 --> 01:45:24,607
Storm's coming.

1042
01:45:39,080 --> 01:45:41,040
The storm
will be here in a few hours.

1043
01:45:41,207 --> 01:45:42,292
We'll be safe here.

1044
01:45:44,002 --> 01:45:45,587
Do you know what this place is?

1045
01:45:46,337 --> 01:45:48,590
It's an old ecological testing station.

1046
01:45:52,135 --> 01:45:53,886
They were meant to tame the planet.

1047
01:45:54,053 --> 01:45:55,972
Free the water locked beneath the sands.

1048
01:45:59,559 --> 01:46:01,477
Arrakis could have been a paradise.

1049
01:46:02,228 --> 01:46:05,023
The work had begun,
but then the spice was discovered.

1050
01:46:05,189 --> 01:46:07,400
And suddenly no one
wanted the desert to go away.

1051
01:46:08,067 --> 01:46:09,068
Tanat,

1052
01:46:09,152 --> 01:46:10,987
will you find stillsuits
to fit our visitors?

1053
01:46:11,070 --> 01:46:12,196
Yes, Liet.

1054
01:46:12,363 --> 01:46:13,740
Shamir,
a coffee service, please.

1055
01:46:13,906 --> 01:46:15,074
Of course, Liet.

1056
01:46:16,451 --> 01:46:18,578
- Who are you to the Fremen?

1057
01:47:09,796 --> 01:47:11,255
You know what
the Great Houses fear most,

1058
01:47:11,339 --> 01:47:12,423
Dr. Kynes?

1059
01:47:14,509 --> 01:47:16,177
Exactly what has happened
to us here.

1060
01:47:17,679 --> 01:47:18,805
The Sardaukar coming

1061
01:47:18,888 --> 01:47:20,306
and picking them off
one by one.

1062
01:47:23,726 --> 01:47:25,228
Only together
can they stand a chance

1063
01:47:25,311 --> 01:47:26,354
against the Imperium.

1064
01:47:28,856 --> 01:47:30,108
Would you bear witness?

1065
01:47:31,234 --> 01:47:33,444
Testify that the Emperor
has moved against us here?

1066
01:47:34,320 --> 01:47:36,155
If they believe me,

1067
01:47:37,365 --> 01:47:39,075
there would be general warfare

1068
01:47:39,158 --> 01:47:41,160
between the Great Houses
and the Emperor.

1069
01:47:41,327 --> 01:47:42,453
Chaos

1070
01:47:43,037 --> 01:47:44,372
across the Imperium.

1071
01:47:44,664 --> 01:47:46,082
Suppose I presented the Emperor

1072
01:47:46,165 --> 01:47:47,417
with an alternative to chaos.

1073
01:47:48,668 --> 01:47:50,211
The Emperor has no sons.

1074
01:47:50,753 --> 01:47:52,171
And his daughters have yet to marry.

1075
01:47:52,797 --> 01:47:54,757
You'd make a play for the throne?

1076
01:47:55,717 --> 01:47:57,468
The Emperor feared the Atreides.

1077
01:47:57,552 --> 01:47:59,053
He brought you here to kill you.

1078
01:47:59,220 --> 01:48:00,805
What don't you understand?

1079
01:48:01,806 --> 01:48:04,475
You're a lost boy hiding
in a hole in the ground.

1080
01:48:09,355 --> 01:48:11,774
The Fremen speak
of the Lisan al-Gaib.

1081
01:48:12,775 --> 01:48:14,026
Careful.

1082
01:48:14,819 --> 01:48:17,613
The Voice from the Outer World
who will lead them to paradise.

1083
01:48:19,490 --> 01:48:20,658
Superstition.

1084
01:48:25,580 --> 01:48:27,290
I know you loved a Fremen warrior

1085
01:48:27,373 --> 01:48:28,583
and lost him in battle.

1086
01:48:32,044 --> 01:48:35,214
I know you walk in two worlds
and are known by many names.

1087
01:48:40,845 --> 01:48:42,305
I've seen your dream.

1088
01:48:46,976 --> 01:48:48,060
As emperor, Dr. Kynes,

1089
01:48:48,227 --> 01:48:50,062
I could make a paradise of Arrakis

1090
01:48:50,146 --> 01:48:51,397
with a wave of my hand.

1091
01:50:47,597 --> 01:50:48,556
Sardaukar!

1092
01:50:51,767 --> 01:50:52,935
No! Duncan!

1093
01:50:53,102 --> 01:50:54,228
Paul, no!

1094
01:50:54,395 --> 01:50:55,646
-  Duncan, no!
-  No!

1095
01:50:56,939 --> 01:50:58,107
-  No!
-  Paul, no!

1096
01:50:59,358 --> 01:51:00,526
Duncan, no!

1097
01:51:00,902 --> 01:51:03,154
- He's locked the door.
-  Duncan! No!

1098
01:51:52,370 --> 01:51:53,329
He's gone.

1099
01:51:54,080 --> 01:51:55,081
Duncan!

1100
01:51:55,247 --> 01:51:56,707
We have to go. We have no choice.

1101
01:52:04,423 --> 01:52:06,467
Paul, go! Paul!

1102
01:52:25,820 --> 01:52:27,363
Come on.
Come on, come on!

1103
01:52:58,769 --> 01:53:00,146
Follow the light.

1104
01:53:00,604 --> 01:53:02,314
You'll find a thopter ready to fly.

1105
01:53:02,898 --> 01:53:04,692
That storm out there is your best shot.

1106
01:53:05,109 --> 01:53:07,445
Above 5,000 meters, it's mostly dust.

1107
01:53:07,820 --> 01:53:11,407
Climb into it. Stay on top.
Head south. Find the Fremen.

1108
01:53:11,699 --> 01:53:12,700
Are you not coming with us?

1109
01:53:12,992 --> 01:53:14,035
It only seats two.

1110
01:53:14,285 --> 01:53:15,745
I'll go to the next station

1111
01:53:16,162 --> 01:53:17,705
and report this attack
to the Landsraad.

1112
01:53:17,872 --> 01:53:19,081
How?

1113
01:53:19,957 --> 01:53:20,958
I'm Fremen.

1114
01:53:21,917 --> 01:53:23,169
The desert's my home.

1115
01:53:24,170 --> 01:53:25,171
Good luck.

1116
01:53:25,337 --> 01:53:26,297
Good luck.

1117
01:56:07,625 --> 01:56:09,543
I serve only one master.

1118
01:56:10,377 --> 01:56:13,172
His name is Shai-Hulud.

1119
01:56:58,550 --> 01:56:59,969
There are jet flares behind us.

1120
01:57:34,211 --> 01:57:35,963
Paul. We're not high enough!

1121
01:58:08,454 --> 01:58:09,538
I must not fear.

1122
01:58:10,122 --> 01:58:11,290
Fear is the mind-killer.

1123
01:58:11,999 --> 01:58:14,877
Fear is the little death
that brings obliteration.

1124
01:58:21,175 --> 01:58:23,677
See the friend.

1125
01:58:28,098 --> 01:58:30,142
See the friend.

1126
01:58:33,645 --> 01:58:36,065
The mystery of life
isn't a problem to solve...

1127
01:58:39,693 --> 01:58:41,445
but a reality to experience.

1128
01:58:45,491 --> 01:58:47,034
A process that cannot
be understood

1129
01:58:47,117 --> 01:58:48,327
by stopping it.

1130
01:58:50,037 --> 01:58:51,830
We must move
with the flow of the process.

1131
01:58:53,415 --> 01:58:54,583
We must join it.

1132
01:58:56,001 --> 01:58:57,002
We must flow with it.

1133
01:58:57,503 --> 01:58:58,754
Let go.

1134
01:58:59,088 --> 01:59:00,422
Let go.

1135
01:59:48,512 --> 01:59:51,807
We chased them
into a Coriolis storm.

1136
01:59:53,809 --> 01:59:55,894
Winds at 800 kilometers an hour.

1137
02:00:01,191 --> 02:00:02,734
Nothing survives such a storm.

1138
02:00:03,444 --> 02:00:04,361
They're dead.

1139
02:00:06,321 --> 02:00:07,406
It's a certainty.

1140
02:00:15,122 --> 02:00:16,832
So, it's done. Finally.

1141
02:00:19,710 --> 02:00:21,211
Send word to Giedi Prime

1142
02:00:21,670 --> 02:00:23,672
to begin selling our spice reserves.

1143
02:00:25,257 --> 02:00:26,216
But slowly.

1144
02:00:27,593 --> 02:00:29,052
We don't want the price to fall.

1145
02:00:30,179 --> 02:00:31,555
You have no idea how much it cost me

1146
02:00:31,638 --> 02:00:33,432
to bring such a force to bear here.

1147
02:00:34,475 --> 02:00:36,143
Now I only have one requirement.

1148
02:00:37,269 --> 02:00:38,353
Income.

1149
02:00:39,396 --> 02:00:40,772
So, squeeze, Rabban.

1150
02:00:41,899 --> 02:00:43,066
Squeeze hard.

1151
02:00:43,442 --> 02:00:44,485
Yes, Uncle.

1152
02:00:46,403 --> 02:00:47,488
And the Fremen?

1153
02:00:48,655 --> 02:00:49,740
Kill them all.

1154
02:01:13,430 --> 02:01:14,806
We're above 5,000 meters.

1155
02:02:53,030 --> 02:02:54,781
As soon as we land,
run for the rocks.

1156
02:04:47,894 --> 02:04:49,104
And breathe through this.

1157
02:05:20,135 --> 02:05:21,720
Now we have to find the Fremen.

1158
02:05:23,680 --> 02:05:24,848
Are you good?

1159
02:05:25,015 --> 02:05:25,932
Yeah.

1160
02:06:33,250 --> 02:06:34,584
Paul...

1161
02:06:41,550 --> 02:06:44,302
Don't be frightened.

1162
02:06:45,929 --> 02:06:48,598
Even a little
desert mouse can survive.

1163
02:06:49,724 --> 02:06:52,936
Don't be frightened.

1164
02:06:53,353 --> 02:06:54,729
You'll need to face your fears.

1165
02:06:55,105 --> 02:06:56,314
A friend...

1166
02:06:56,940 --> 02:06:59,484
A friend will help you.

1167
02:07:01,444 --> 02:07:02,821
Follow the friend.

1168
02:07:06,199 --> 02:07:07,200
You have much to learn.

1169
02:07:09,661 --> 02:07:11,496
And I will show you
the ways of the desert.

1170
02:07:15,542 --> 02:07:16,626
Come with me.

1171
02:07:45,113 --> 02:07:47,407
The sietch where Duncan lived

1172
02:07:48,783 --> 02:07:49,951
is somewhere off that way.

1173
02:07:53,246 --> 02:07:54,873
I can see
greenery over there.

1174
02:07:56,124 --> 02:07:57,000
There.

1175
02:07:57,167 --> 02:07:58,501
That means Fremen live there.

1176
02:08:03,757 --> 02:08:04,966
We'll cross after dark.

1177
02:08:06,051 --> 02:08:07,177
That's how the Fremen do it.

1178
02:08:10,972 --> 02:08:12,766
We're about to enter
worm territory.

1179
02:08:13,642 --> 02:08:15,226
We can't walk like regular humans.

1180
02:08:15,602 --> 02:08:16,561
If we do, we're dead.

1181
02:08:17,062 --> 02:08:18,563
We'll have to walk like the Fremen do.

1182
02:08:18,939 --> 02:08:20,148
It's called a sandwalk.

1183
02:08:20,732 --> 02:08:22,567
At least according
to the filmbooks back home.

1184
02:08:23,401 --> 02:08:24,653
Yeah. Yeah, okay.

1185
02:08:24,819 --> 02:08:26,112
Okay. Follow me.

1186
02:08:26,446 --> 02:08:27,697
Do the same moves.

1187
02:08:41,670 --> 02:08:42,921
I think this is the right direction.

1188
02:10:05,587 --> 02:10:06,588
It's close by.

1189
02:10:07,547 --> 02:10:08,757
Let's get out of here.

1190
02:10:10,300 --> 02:10:11,926
- Wait.

1191
02:10:13,344 --> 02:10:15,096
- It's drum sand.

1192
02:10:19,768 --> 02:10:20,894
-  Run.

1193
02:10:27,692 --> 02:10:28,985
Go! Go!

1194
02:11:41,224 --> 02:11:42,267
It's a thumper.

1195
02:11:47,939 --> 02:11:49,232
Someone set off a thumper.

1196
02:12:04,205 --> 02:12:06,207
Paul! Run!

1197
02:12:21,306 --> 02:12:22,265
How big are they?

1198
02:12:22,515 --> 02:12:23,600
That was insane.

1199
02:12:28,646 --> 02:12:29,564
Someone called it.

1200
02:13:02,430 --> 02:13:03,681
Do not run.

1201
02:13:05,141 --> 02:13:07,435
You will only waste
your body's water.

1202
02:13:08,603 --> 02:13:09,479
Hold.

1203
02:13:17,278 --> 02:13:18,279
Stilgar.

1204
02:13:18,363 --> 02:13:19,364
- Hey!

1205
02:13:19,989 --> 02:13:21,324
You know me. I was there

1206
02:13:21,407 --> 02:13:22,617
when you came
to my father's Council.

1207
02:13:22,909 --> 02:13:23,785
Oh.

1208
02:13:24,077 --> 02:13:25,620
This is the Duke's son.

1209
02:13:26,287 --> 02:13:27,288
Why are you waiting?

1210
02:13:28,039 --> 02:13:29,123
We need their water.

1211
02:13:30,083 --> 02:13:31,793
This is the boy
I told you about.

1212
02:13:32,335 --> 02:13:33,503
We can't touch him.

1213
02:13:38,049 --> 02:13:39,217
They are weaklings.

1214
02:13:39,384 --> 02:13:40,218
Jamis.

1215
02:13:41,302 --> 02:13:43,179
That was a brave crossing they made

1216
02:13:43,263 --> 02:13:44,889
in the path of Shai-Hulud.

1217
02:13:46,266 --> 02:13:48,643
He does not speak
or act like a weakling.

1218
02:13:50,353 --> 02:13:51,562
Nor did his father.

1219
02:13:52,230 --> 02:13:53,523
My thumper saved his life.

1220
02:13:54,899 --> 02:13:56,567
Go back to reason, Stilgar.

1221
02:13:57,360 --> 02:13:58,403
He's not The One.

1222
02:14:01,823 --> 02:14:03,116
We have powerful friends.

1223
02:14:03,700 --> 02:14:06,327
You help us off-world, to Caladan,

1224
02:14:06,911 --> 02:14:08,121
you will be well rewarded.

1225
02:14:08,288 --> 02:14:10,665
What wealth can you offer
beyond the water

1226
02:14:11,040 --> 02:14:12,125
in your flesh?

1227
02:14:15,378 --> 02:14:16,462
Hmm...

1228
02:14:17,505 --> 02:14:18,631
The boy is young.

1229
02:14:19,257 --> 02:14:20,758
He can learn our ways.

1230
02:14:21,551 --> 02:14:22,885
He may have sanctuary.

1231
02:14:24,304 --> 02:14:26,514
But the woman is untrained...

1232
02:14:29,267 --> 02:14:30,601
and too old to learn.

1233
02:15:02,050 --> 02:15:03,968
-  Back, you dogs.

1234
02:15:05,678 --> 02:15:06,846
She'll cut my throat.

1235
02:15:12,977 --> 02:15:15,229
Why didn't you say
you were a weirding woman?

1236
02:15:15,688 --> 02:15:16,647
And a fighter?

1237
02:15:17,190 --> 02:15:18,649
Conversation ran short.

1238
02:15:19,442 --> 02:15:21,027
Peace, woman.

1239
02:15:21,652 --> 02:15:22,779
Peace.

1240
02:15:23,821 --> 02:15:25,323
I judged hastily.

1241
02:16:05,029 --> 02:16:06,948
I would not
have let you hurt my friends.

1242
02:16:32,473 --> 02:16:33,808
They say you're the Mahdi.

1243
02:16:35,184 --> 02:16:36,727
But you look like a little boy.

1244
02:16:38,354 --> 02:16:39,647
You chose the hardest way up.

1245
02:16:39,981 --> 02:16:40,857
Follow me.

1246
02:16:48,656 --> 02:16:49,824
Give it to me.

1247
02:16:57,457 --> 02:16:58,875
You will have your own maula pistol

1248
02:16:58,958 --> 02:17:00,168
when you've earned it.

1249
02:17:01,043 --> 02:17:02,044
Give it to me.

1250
02:17:08,050 --> 02:17:09,886
Chani, take charge of the newcomers.

1251
02:17:10,261 --> 02:17:12,305
See that they are safe
on the journey. Let's go.

1252
02:17:12,722 --> 02:17:13,931
I will not have them.

1253
02:17:20,980 --> 02:17:21,981
Jamis,

1254
02:17:22,648 --> 02:17:24,692
I have spoken. Be still.

1255
02:17:24,984 --> 02:17:26,444
You talk like a leader.

1256
02:17:27,862 --> 02:17:29,322
But the strongest leads.

1257
02:17:30,990 --> 02:17:32,116
She bested you.

1258
02:17:34,035 --> 02:17:35,244
I invoke the amtal.

1259
02:17:36,412 --> 02:17:38,706
You may not challenge
a Sayyadina.

1260
02:17:38,873 --> 02:17:40,124
Then who will fight in her name?

1261
02:17:40,666 --> 02:17:42,460
Jamis, don't do this.

1262
02:17:43,377 --> 02:17:45,296
Don't. The night is fading.

1263
02:17:45,463 --> 02:17:48,007
Then the sun will witness this death.

1264
02:17:48,674 --> 02:17:49,926
Where is her champion?

1265
02:18:01,437 --> 02:18:02,813
I accept her champion.

1266
02:18:35,513 --> 02:18:38,266
Paul Atreides must die...

1267
02:18:41,185 --> 02:18:45,648
for Kwisatz Haderach to rise.

1268
02:18:48,609 --> 02:18:51,404
Don't be frightened.

1269
02:18:52,405 --> 02:18:53,781
Don't resist.

1270
02:19:00,079 --> 02:19:02,039
When you take a life,

1271
02:19:03,082 --> 02:19:04,834
you take your own.

1272
02:19:36,782 --> 02:19:38,451
I don't believe
you're the Lisan al-Gaib.

1273
02:19:40,703 --> 02:19:42,246
But I want you to die with honor.

1274
02:19:54,216 --> 02:19:56,594
This crysknife was given to me
by my great aunt.

1275
02:20:00,306 --> 02:20:02,141
It's made from a tooth of Shai-Hulud.

1276
02:20:02,767 --> 02:20:03,893
The great sandworm.

1277
02:20:06,103 --> 02:20:08,189
This will be a great honor,
for you to die holding it.

1278
02:20:13,319 --> 02:20:14,904
Where is the Outworlder?

1279
02:20:19,825 --> 02:20:21,160
Jamis is a good fighter.

1280
02:20:22,787 --> 02:20:23,829
He won't let you suffer.

1281
02:20:25,873 --> 02:20:26,957
Chani...

1282
02:20:30,419 --> 02:20:31,253
Um...

1283
02:20:39,637 --> 02:20:40,513
Never mind.

1284
02:21:36,694 --> 02:21:37,987
May thy knife chip and shatter.

1285
02:21:46,328 --> 02:21:47,788
You should welcome my blade.

1286
02:21:51,709 --> 02:21:53,043
This world will kill you.

1287
02:21:56,797 --> 02:21:57,965
Quicker this way.

1288
02:22:38,130 --> 02:22:39,715
- Do you yield?

1289
02:22:42,092 --> 02:22:43,719
The boy doesn't know our rule.

1290
02:22:44,887 --> 02:22:46,722
There's no yielding
under the amtal rule.

1291
02:22:46,889 --> 02:22:48,390
Only death is the test of it.

1292
02:22:56,982 --> 02:22:58,692
- Is he toying with him?
- No.

1293
02:23:00,528 --> 02:23:01,529
Paul has never killed a man.

1294
02:23:12,623 --> 02:23:16,585
Kwisatz Haderach.

1295
02:23:20,047 --> 02:23:22,842
Kwisatz Haderach.

1296
02:23:23,217 --> 02:23:27,012
Climb up. Rise.

1297
02:25:19,917 --> 02:25:21,210
You're one of us now.

1298
02:25:21,794 --> 02:25:23,045
A life for a life.

1299
02:25:23,796 --> 02:25:25,339
Come with us to Sietch Tabr.

1300
02:25:25,589 --> 02:25:26,465
No.

1301
02:25:26,882 --> 02:25:28,050
Paul needs to get off-world.

1302
02:25:28,425 --> 02:25:30,344
You must have ways. You have smugglers,

1303
02:25:30,427 --> 02:25:31,470
you have ships.

1304
02:25:31,679 --> 02:25:32,846
-  No.
-  You have...

1305
02:25:34,014 --> 02:25:35,683
The Emperor sent us to this place.

1306
02:25:37,643 --> 02:25:38,852
And my father came,

1307
02:25:40,145 --> 02:25:41,480
not for spice,

1308
02:25:42,398 --> 02:25:43,691
not for the riches,

1309
02:25:45,109 --> 02:25:46,568
but for the strength of your people.

1310
02:25:50,239 --> 02:25:51,740
My road leads into the desert.

1311
02:25:54,994 --> 02:25:55,953
I can see it.

1312
02:25:58,706 --> 02:25:59,873
If you'll have us,

1313
02:26:01,417 --> 02:26:02,418
we will come.

1314
02:26:51,717 --> 02:26:52,718
Desert power.

1315
02:26:54,470 --> 02:26:55,721
This is only the beginning.
