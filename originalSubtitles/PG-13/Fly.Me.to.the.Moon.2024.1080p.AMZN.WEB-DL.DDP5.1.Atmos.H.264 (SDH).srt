00:01:04,064 --> 00:01:06,801
<i>There has been some debate

<i>It's a groovy trip,</i>

53

[people chattering]

00:03:49,229 --> 00:03:50,430
First week as manager, Stu.

57
00:03:50,565 --> 00:03:51,431
Doesn't sound like
it's going great.

58
00:03:51,566 --> 00:03:52,800
So either our meters are off

59
00:03:52,934 --> 00:03:54,494
or there's a breach
in one of the tanks.

60
00:03:54,602 --> 00:03:56,504
But there's no
protocol for this.

61
00:03:56,637 --> 00:03:58,982
- And we can't source the leak because it's liquid hyd...
- Liquid hydrogen.

62
00:03:59,006 --> 00:04:01,408
It's colorless and odorless.
Everybody out! Let's go!

63
00:04:01,542 --> 00:04:03,077
Reed, Kyle, pencils down.

64
00:04:03,211 --> 00:04:05,613
It could be burning, and we
wouldn't know it. Find a door.

65
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:08,649
Come on! Run, run! No walking.

66
00:04:15,790 --> 00:04:17,692
What's he doing?
Is he cleaning?

67
00:04:17,825 --> 00:04:20,185
No, no. It's an... It's an
old-school leak detection process.

68
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:22,130
It's a broom.

69
00:04:22,262 --> 00:04:25,533
Stu, you're better than this. Come on.
Straw plus liquid hydrogen equals...

70
00:04:25,900 --> 00:04:27,635
[grunting]

71
00:04:33,141 --> 00:04:35,221
All right, we're good! Don't
worry about it. Come on.

00:04:35,342 --> 00:04:36,878
We got work to do. Let's go.

[coughing]

74
00:04:46,821 --> 00:04:49,557
Uh, the new protocol
is the broom method.

75
00:04:52,260 --> 00:04:53,561
We need a new broom.

76
00:05:01,235 --> 00:05:02,737
I for sure thought he was dead.

77
00:05:02,870 --> 00:05:04,404
[grunts] Come on.

78
00:05:06,541 --> 00:05:07,675
- [sighs]
- It's still broke

79
00:05:07,809 --> 00:05:09,309
from the last time
you were in a mood.

80
00:05:09,442 --> 00:05:10,878
Yeah, I can see that.

81
00:05:11,012 --> 00:05:14,381
- Boeing called again.
- Call Congress, Henry, not me.

82
00:05:15,283 --> 00:05:16,751
I don't have their number.

83
00:05:16,884 --> 00:05:19,787
Every day, every day, something
is breaking around here.

84
00:05:19,921 --> 00:05:23,891
Or blowing up. We're underfunded,
under... understaffed.

85
00:05:24,025 --> 00:05:26,270
But yeah, we're still expected to
beat the pants off the Russians.

86
00:05:26,294 --> 00:05:28,763
You mind telling me how the
hell we're supposed to do that?

87
00:05:28,896 --> 00:05:31,331
Could start by being a little
nicer to the vending machines.

88
00:05:31,464 --> 00:05:32,834
Ooh! There it is!

89
00:05:33,668 --> 00:05:35,335
- What?
- There's a cat.

90
00:05:35,468 --> 00:05:38,673
-[Henry] So what?
-It's a black cat, Henry. It's bad luck.

91
00:05:39,774 --> 00:05:41,843
- [grunts, sighs]
- Okay, it's gone.

92
00:05:41,976 --> 00:05:46,413
-All right. Thank God.
-Okay. Let's go. [breathes shakily]

93
00:05:46,547 --> 00:05:48,348
- Call security.
- I won't.

94
00:05:48,481 --> 00:05:49,884
- I will not. It...
- Yes, you will.

95
00:05:50,017 --> 00:05:53,154
The last thing that we need
around here is a black cat.

96
00:05:53,287 --> 00:05:55,323
[Henry] They don't deal
with things like this.

97
00:05:55,455 --> 00:05:57,124
Yes, they do. They do now.

98
00:05:57,258 --> 00:06:00,695
- Y-You're overreacting.
- No, you're not overreacting enough.

99
00:06:00,828 --> 00:06:03,698
Call 'em right now. Right now.

100
00:06:17,545 --> 00:06:18,679
How do I look?

101
00:06:18,813 --> 00:06:20,681
You're glowing. Good luck.

102
00:06:20,815 --> 00:06:23,050
- [laughing]
- Good afternoon, boys.

103
00:06:23,184 --> 00:06:25,953
Wrong room, sweetheart.
We don't need dictation.

104
00:06:26,087 --> 00:06:28,031
I'm Kelly Jones. I'll be
running the meeting today.

105
00:06:28,055 --> 00:06:29,924
You must be Phil Hunley,
Neil Brown and...

106
00:06:30,057 --> 00:06:33,828
Ooh. [chuckles] Zack Tanner. You
don't mind if I sit down, do you?

107
00:06:33,961 --> 00:06:36,931
Uh, all due respect, Mrs. Jones,
we're a progressive company.

108
00:06:37,064 --> 00:06:39,700
We employ 16 women
in our steno pool.

109
00:06:39,834 --> 00:06:42,536
We're selling
sports cars to men.

110
00:06:42,670 --> 00:06:44,105
We're selling a
300 horsepower...

111
00:06:44,238 --> 00:06:47,808
355, 428 cubic inch V-8
beast is what you're selling.

112
00:06:47,942 --> 00:06:51,212
You want to focus on the car's
speed. Something like this.

113
00:06:51,345 --> 00:06:57,652
Look familiar? Chevy Camaro.
Pontiac Firebird. And Oldsmobile.

114
00:06:57,785 --> 00:06:59,153
All from last month.

115
00:06:59,287 --> 00:07:00,755
Thankfully, you have something

116
00:07:00,888 --> 00:07:02,957
that your competition
doesn't have.

117
00:07:03,090 --> 00:07:08,562
The Mustang Fastback. "355 horses
for him. Seat belts for the family."

118
00:07:08,696 --> 00:07:13,067
The seat belts? We only put them in
because they might be mandatory next year.

119
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:14,969
Let's play a game.

120
00:07:15,102 --> 00:07:18,606
Now I'm gonna guess what kind of
car each one of you gentlemen drive.

121
00:07:21,742 --> 00:07:28,683
Zack, Ford Mustang '66
convertible. It's poppy red.

122
00:07:29,784 --> 00:07:32,787
Oh, no Mustangs for
you husbands though.

123
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:35,156
A Lincoln Continental for Neil.

124
00:07:37,792 --> 00:07:39,293
A station wagon for poor Phil.

125
00:07:39,427 --> 00:07:43,230
Oh, Phil. You know what
the best part of my day is?

126
00:07:44,799 --> 00:07:48,669
When my husband Charlie
comes home at night.

127
00:07:48,803 --> 00:07:54,809
I can't even imagine what it would be
like if-if one night he... he didn't.

128
00:07:54,942 --> 00:07:57,745
- [sighs]
- Now imagine the conversation

129
00:07:57,878 --> 00:08:01,949
if someone told your
wife that this car,

130
00:08:02,083 --> 00:08:04,552
its 355 horses
and 105 top speed,

131
00:08:04,685 --> 00:08:10,758
this car is what brings her husband
home safe to her family every night.

132
00:08:11,659 --> 00:08:13,260
Now she wants you to have it.

133
00:08:13,394 --> 00:08:17,331
She says the words every
married man dreams of hearing...

134
00:08:18,966 --> 00:08:24,805
"I'd feel so much better if you bought
yourself that Mustang, sweetheart."

135
00:08:25,473 --> 00:08:27,742
[swallows]

136
00:08:30,978 --> 00:08:33,547
How did you guess what
kind of cars they drive?

137
00:08:33,681 --> 00:08:35,916
What, bribe their
secretaries or something?

138
00:08:36,784 --> 00:08:38,219
Kelly, seriously?

139
00:08:38,352 --> 00:08:40,464
Two packs of Virginia Slims
and a bottle of Paco Rabanne.

140
00:08:40,488 --> 00:08:42,156
- Everyone has their price.
- [chuckles]

141
00:08:42,289 --> 00:08:45,226
I'm just lucky that my water
didn't break in there. Oh, God.

142
00:08:45,359 --> 00:08:47,528
Hi, Ron. How's the wife?

143
00:08:50,531 --> 00:08:52,466
Now, the baby bump,
dry-clean only.

144
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:56,070
Yes, I have that noted. A-Also,
Omega confirmed for next week,

145
00:08:56,203 --> 00:08:57,547
I finished the
Baskin-Robbins artwork,

146
00:08:57,571 --> 00:08:58,739
and that guy from Palmex

147
00:08:58,873 --> 00:09:00,117
asked for your
address to send roses,

148
00:09:00,141 --> 00:09:01,876
but I gave him
mine because I know

149
00:09:02,009 --> 00:09:03,720
- how you feel about roses.
- How I feel about roses.

150
00:09:03,744 --> 00:09:07,815
Also, John called. Again. He wants
to take you to dinner Tuesday.

151
00:09:07,948 --> 00:09:10,384
Tell him I moved to LA. And
call Bruce from Dow Chemical.

152
00:09:10,519 --> 00:09:12,920
I hear they're looking for
a new agency for Ziploc.

153
00:09:13,054 --> 00:09:15,723
People should be boycotting
Dow. They make napalm.

154
00:09:15,856 --> 00:09:19,026
People say they're boycotting, but
they're still buying sandwich bags.

155
00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:21,162
They also sell Saran
Wrap and Styrofoam.

156
00:09:21,295 --> 00:09:24,015
Think people are going to stop using
Styrofoam? What's your coffee in?

157
00:09:24,065 --> 00:09:26,500
Now, I know you and your
friends want to save the world,

158
00:09:26,634 --> 00:09:29,136
and by the time you're
running this place in 1984,

159
00:09:29,270 --> 00:09:31,114
there's gonna be no nukes
and equal rights for all.

160
00:09:31,138 --> 00:09:33,741
But until then, we've
got a job to do.

161
00:09:33,874 --> 00:09:38,946
Kelly! Kelly! Kelly. Kelly.
We've got a big problem.

162
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:42,650
I just stormed off set,
and, yes, it was justified.

163
00:09:42,783 --> 00:09:45,152
I cannot work with
these Hoover people.

164
00:09:45,286 --> 00:09:49,723
Apparently, they have issues with the
way that I am shooting their commercial.

165
00:09:49,857 --> 00:09:51,937
They actually said that.
"Their." It's my commercial.

166
00:09:52,026 --> 00:09:54,628
They make vacuums. I make art.

167
00:09:54,762 --> 00:09:56,440
- Sorry, did we have a meeting set?
- No. No.

168
00:09:56,464 --> 00:09:58,466
I'm sorry. I didn't
realize I had to set a time

169
00:09:58,599 --> 00:10:00,267
to speak to one of
my dearest friends.

170
00:10:00,401 --> 00:10:02,312
The last time we spoke, you fired
me. And I don't work for you.

171
00:10:02,336 --> 00:10:04,638
You know what, Kelly, I didn't
come in here to be berated.

172
00:10:04,772 --> 00:10:06,373
I came in to be agreed with!

173
00:10:06,508 --> 00:10:08,309
You have that
Nestlé pitch in ten.

174
00:10:08,442 --> 00:10:09,477
Very important.

175
00:10:09,610 --> 00:10:11,178
- That is a lie. Goodbye.
- [sighs]

176
00:10:11,312 --> 00:10:13,414
Lance, getting you
this directing gig

177
00:10:13,548 --> 00:10:15,049
- was a Christmas miracle.
- [scoffs]

178
00:10:15,182 --> 00:10:17,586
It took me three weeks to
convince them that you were stable

179
00:10:17,718 --> 00:10:19,038
after your Jell-O
shoot from hell.

180
00:10:19,086 --> 00:10:21,288
[gibbering] Jell-O
was not my fault.

181
00:10:21,422 --> 00:10:23,991
- Ugh. That actor wa...
- Was five. You made him cry.

182
00:10:24,125 --> 00:10:25,365
Well, I did that child a favor.

183
00:10:25,459 --> 00:10:26,561
Hollywood is no cakewalk.

184
00:10:26,694 --> 00:10:27,904
What about the Heinz commercial?

185
00:10:27,928 --> 00:10:29,196
You went 40,000 over budget.

186
00:10:29,330 --> 00:10:31,866
- It was about ketchup.
- It was not about ketchup.

187
00:10:31,999 --> 00:10:33,901
It was about the
promise of ketchup.

188
00:10:34,034 --> 00:10:36,403
No one sees what I'm
doing for their products.

189
00:10:36,538 --> 00:10:37,606
I am elevating them.

190
00:10:37,738 --> 00:10:39,907
I should be in film by now.

191
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:42,643
I passed on directing
<i>Valley of the Dolls.</i>

192
00:10:42,776 --> 00:10:44,478
That is on me, but still.

193
00:10:44,613 --> 00:10:47,023
Now, what do we call you, right? The
Kubrick of commercials. All right.

194
00:10:47,047 --> 00:10:50,619
Oh, my God. Stanley is a hack. He does one
good movie, and suddenly he's a genius.

195
00:10:50,751 --> 00:10:53,854
You are a legend,
right? Creative genius.

196
00:10:53,988 --> 00:10:56,724
You're also hotheaded, mercurial and
can't stick to a budget for shit.

197
00:10:56,857 --> 00:10:58,569
- Oh, thank you.
- That wasn't a compliment.

198
00:10:58,593 --> 00:10:59,793
It is when you stop listening.

199
00:10:59,927 --> 00:11:02,396
If you quit Hoover,
you'll be unhirable.

200
00:11:04,765 --> 00:11:06,133
- [grunts]
- Okay.

201
00:11:06,267 --> 00:11:08,302
Lance, why don't you march
your ass back to set,

202
00:11:08,435 --> 00:11:10,395
and you apologize for
whatever fit you threw, okay?

203
00:11:10,471 --> 00:11:13,083
Buy your boyfriend something nice for
Christmas for putting up with you.

204
00:11:13,107 --> 00:11:14,475
Get something for me too, okay?

205
00:11:14,609 --> 00:11:16,911
- [kisses] Merry Christmas, Lance.
- Merry Christmas.

206
00:11:17,044 --> 00:11:19,680
Can you get me a
decent job, please?

- Thanks.

Two specials tonight. Chicken
potpie and Oysters Rockefeller.

213

We'll do the chicken.

Why would they do that?

220
00:12:06,460 --> 00:12:07,761

have a bun in the oven.

What is this? Who do
you work for, Ogilvy?

228
00:12:29,016 --> 00:12:30,856
Huh? You can't outsell
me, so you got me fired?

229
00:12:30,918 --> 00:12:34,188
Just the opposite.
I wanna hire you.

00:12:38,826 --> 00:12:40,094
Of what company?

233
00:12:43,764 --> 00:12:45,600

Stewardess from Chicago.

Amy, the nurse from Ohio.

Well, Moe, what's
bigger than Ford?

of. He-He-He works for the government.

working for Richard Nixon?

work for Richard Nixon.

331
00:17:15,703 --> 00:17:17,605
What makes you think
I'm an astronaut?

332
00:17:17,739 --> 00:17:20,875
Because you have an Apollo pin,
and only astronauts get those.

333
00:17:21,009 --> 00:17:22,510
So you know a thing
or two about NASA.

334
00:17:22,644 --> 00:17:26,814
Yeah, well, I'm a recent
fan. I'm Kelly Jones.

335
00:17:26,948 --> 00:17:31,151
[chuckles] I'm no astronaut. I
just work at Kennedy. Cole Davis.

336
00:17:31,953 --> 00:17:33,555
Well, what do you do there?

337
00:17:33,688 --> 00:17:36,290
[stammers] Uh... Look, the
last thing I want to do

338
00:17:36,423 --> 00:17:38,960
- is make small talk about my job.
- Oh. [chuckles]

339
00:17:39,092 --> 00:17:40,562
Sorry. That didn't sound...

340
00:17:40,695 --> 00:17:42,038
- I didn't mean it for it to... Uh.
- That's okay.

341
00:17:42,062 --> 00:17:43,430
No. You were being honest.

342
00:17:43,565 --> 00:17:45,205
- [Joe] Order up, Cole.
- [stammers] Um...

Welcome to Rockets Road,

365
00:19:26,634 --> 00:19:29,971
also known as Alligator Alley.

366
00:19:30,104 --> 00:19:34,075
You'll wanna keep your arms
and legs inside the cart

367
00:19:34,207 --> 00:19:36,243
if you wanna keep
your arms and legs.

368
00:19:36,376 --> 00:19:37,477
[chuckles]

369
00:19:37,612 --> 00:19:39,413
No, that's just a little joke.

370
00:19:39,547 --> 00:19:41,448
They mostly attack in the water.

371
00:19:41,582 --> 00:19:46,219
Now, today's tour will take approximately
two and a half to three hours.

372
00:19:46,353 --> 00:19:48,756
So let's get comfy-cozy.

373
00:19:49,557 --> 00:19:52,694
Now on the right is
our testing facility.

374
00:19:52,827 --> 00:19:54,028
State-of-the-art.

375
00:19:54,162 --> 00:19:56,296
- [Kelly] It's on fire.
- It is often on fire.

376
00:19:56,430 --> 00:20:00,868
Up ahead, we have the
vehicle assembly building.

377
00:20:01,002 --> 00:20:03,705
That's where they
assemble the rockets.

378
00:20:03,838 --> 00:20:10,444
That is the tallest single-story
building in the world.

379
00:20:10,578 --> 00:20:14,481
You can fit four Statue of
Liberties inside that building.

380
00:20:14,615 --> 00:20:16,694
[Ruby] Wow. <i>Life Magazine</i>
really doesn't do it justice.

381
00:20:16,718 --> 00:20:18,318
This is so gre... I'd
love to go inside.

382
00:20:18,452 --> 00:20:20,088
It's highly
restricted. I'm sorry.

383
00:20:20,220 --> 00:20:21,556
Come on, let's
get a closer look.

384
00:20:21,689 --> 00:20:23,609
Oh, no, no. No. [stammers]
There's no entry here.

385
00:20:23,658 --> 00:20:26,094
You need a special
access badge to enter.

386
00:20:26,226 --> 00:20:27,962
Oh, like... like this one?

387
00:20:28,096 --> 00:20:31,532
Yeah. That's, uh... Oh, no, no,
no, that's... that's my badge.

388
00:20:31,666 --> 00:20:34,135
-Uh, hey... Oh.
-Look at this place. It's enormous!

389
00:20:34,267 --> 00:20:36,504
- It seems like it's much bigger...
- They took my badge!

390
00:20:36,637 --> 00:20:38,139
[Ruby] I mean, look
at this building.

391
00:20:38,271 --> 00:20:40,440
-Hello? That's-That's my badge.
-Hello, sir. Hi.

00:20:40,575 --> 00:20:42,810
Kelly Jones from
NASA Public Affairs.

393
00:20:42,944 --> 00:20:45,312
Here's our all-access pass
for both of us. Thank you.

394
00:20:45,445 --> 00:20:47,481
- [Ruby] Thank you.
- Wait, wait. My card.

395
00:20:52,319 --> 00:20:53,855
Now, this I can sell.

396
00:21:00,661 --> 00:21:01,763
Yoo-hoo!

397
00:21:02,563 --> 00:21:04,799
Hello. Boys, boys!

398
00:21:04,932 --> 00:21:06,366
Hi. Kelly Jones.

399
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:08,669
I'm from the new NASA
Public Affairs team.

400
00:21:08,803 --> 00:21:10,571
Can I ask you two
a few questions?

401
00:21:10,705 --> 00:21:13,074
Name, age, and
what's your job here?

402
00:21:13,207 --> 00:21:18,579
Uh, I'm Stu Bryce. One of the,
uh, head engineers, and I'm 24.

403
00:21:18,713 --> 00:21:20,248
- We'll say 35.
- Yeah.

404
00:21:20,380 --> 00:21:21,249
And you?

405
00:21:21,381 --> 00:21:22,381
I'm Don Harper.

406
00:21:22,482 --> 00:21:24,451
I-I work for him, and I'm 23.

407
00:21:24,986 --> 00:21:26,087
You guys are babies.

408
00:21:26,220 --> 00:21:28,556
The average age at
NASA is 26. [chuckles]

409
00:21:28,689 --> 00:21:31,159
But w-we do know some old
people that work here as well.

410
00:21:31,291 --> 00:21:33,493
- Yeah, like, 32, 33.
- Yeah.

411
00:21:33,628 --> 00:21:35,730
I'll try not to kill both
of you for saying that.

412
00:21:35,863 --> 00:21:38,833
So, tell us, Stu, what brings you
to join this great American mission?

413
00:21:38,966 --> 00:21:42,703
Well, I s... saw a, uh, flyer
in my college dorm. [chuckles]

414
00:21:42,837 --> 00:21:45,305
- "A childhood love of the stars."
- That's good.

415
00:21:45,438 --> 00:21:46,717
- That's very moving.
- That's very good.

416
00:21:46,741 --> 00:21:48,408
- And you?
- [Cole] Excuse me?

417
00:21:51,378 --> 00:21:52,647
What are you doing here?

418
00:21:52,780 --> 00:21:53,815
Well, I...

419
00:21:53,948 --> 00:21:55,788
I tracked you down to
give you my phone number,

420
00:21:55,817 --> 00:21:57,618
'cause I felt we
had a connection.

421
00:21:58,451 --> 00:22:00,387
- What?
- Relax. I'm joking.

422
00:22:00,521 --> 00:22:03,991
I work here now. Moe Berkus brought
me on to revamp NASA Public Affairs.

423
00:22:04,125 --> 00:22:07,228
So you're the killer
from Manhattan.

424
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:09,462
And you must be the
launch director.

425
00:22:09,597 --> 00:22:10,917
This is my associate,
Ruby Martin.

426
00:22:11,032 --> 00:22:12,200
Yeah, I don't care.

427
00:22:12,332 --> 00:22:13,844
Look. This building is
completely off-limits.

428
00:22:13,868 --> 00:22:15,712
Everything in here can burn
you, freeze you, fry you,

429
00:22:15,736 --> 00:22:17,404
poison you and crush you.

430
00:22:17,538 --> 00:22:19,974
- So let's go. Out.
- [Kelly] <i>How long have you worked here?</i>

431
00:22:20,107 --> 00:22:22,810
- A substantial amount of time.
- Hmm.

432
00:22:22,944 --> 00:22:24,745
- What are you writing?
- Your quote.

433
00:22:24,879 --> 00:22:27,181
That's not a quote. It was
just a thing that I said.

434
00:22:27,315 --> 00:22:29,750
I'll punch it up. Do you have
time today for an interview?

435
00:22:29,884 --> 00:22:31,962
And also, I need to sit down
with your senior officers.

436
00:22:31,986 --> 00:22:34,565
- The photogenic types first.
- I can help with the selection process.

437
00:22:34,589 --> 00:22:36,489
Look, my guys are too
weird for interviews,

438
00:22:36,624 --> 00:22:38,664
and they're actually busy
doing life-and-death work.

439
00:22:38,726 --> 00:22:41,963
[chuckles] Well, you know, I
don't need your permission.

440
00:22:42,096 --> 00:22:44,999
The Americans are over their long
and expensive honeymoon in space,

441
00:22:45,132 --> 00:22:47,869
and I'm here to remind them why they
fell in love in the first place.

442
00:22:48,002 --> 00:22:51,305
Is that right? Well, Americans
should be very grateful

443
00:22:51,438 --> 00:22:54,108
that these men are putting their
lives on the line for the mission.

444
00:22:54,242 --> 00:22:57,745
[chuckles] Well, you don't know
much about American people, do you?

445
00:22:57,879 --> 00:23:02,083
[chuckles] You don't know very much about
your office I'm about to show you, do you?

446
00:23:09,523 --> 00:23:10,758
Is this a storage closet?

447
00:23:10,892 --> 00:23:13,127
Nope. Storage
closet has a window.

448
00:23:13,261 --> 00:23:15,997
Okay, so, instant coffee...
[sighs] ...is in the break room.

449
00:23:16,130 --> 00:23:18,900
Just run the tap for a
minute to flush out the rust.

450
00:23:19,033 --> 00:23:23,403
Do either of you know how
to work a fire extinguisher?

451
00:23:24,805 --> 00:23:27,074
No? Mkay. PASS
method's pretty simple.

452
00:23:27,208 --> 00:23:30,544
Just, uh, pull the pin,
aim, squeeze, sweep.

453
00:23:30,678 --> 00:23:32,747
If you need anything else,

454
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:36,150
uh, maybe just go back to New
York and get it. Have a good day.

455
00:23:37,184 --> 00:23:39,287
Well, at least he's
easy on the eyes.

456
00:23:39,419 --> 00:23:41,088
He's hard on the ears though.

457
00:23:41,222 --> 00:23:43,822
Not a great welcome wagon. I thought
you said they wanted our help.

458
00:23:43,858 --> 00:23:45,593
Oh, no. I said they
needed our help.

459
00:23:45,726 --> 00:23:47,304
And I do believe that
now more than ever.

460
00:23:47,328 --> 00:23:49,664
How are we supposed to do that
if we can't talk to anyone

461
00:23:49,797 --> 00:23:50,998
or look at anything?

462
00:23:51,132 --> 00:23:51,999
[screams]

463
00:23:52,133 --> 00:23:54,969
Aw, it's a cat. It's a cat.

464
00:23:55,102 --> 00:23:56,436
- [Ruby] It's a cat!
- It's a cat.

465
00:23:56,570 --> 00:23:58,239
You know what they
say about black cats?

466
00:23:58,372 --> 00:24:01,876
If they cross your path, they're
probably going someplace else.

467
00:24:02,009 --> 00:24:05,313
Okay, time to dig
out the old Rolodex.

468
00:24:05,445 --> 00:24:08,215
Let's get creative. [blows]

469
00:24:29,136 --> 00:24:34,175
Apollo 11 will land
our men on the moon,

470
00:24:34,308 --> 00:24:36,777
and that makes us first.

471
00:24:36,911 --> 00:24:40,381
If we do our jobs, we will
launch right from there,

472
00:24:40,514 --> 00:24:42,550
July 16, bright and early.

473
00:24:42,683 --> 00:24:44,085
Between now and then,

474
00:24:44,218 --> 00:24:47,188
we will piece together
the biggest jigsaw puzzle

475
00:24:47,321 --> 00:24:49,757
in the history of mankind.

476
00:24:49,890 --> 00:24:51,959
Six million parts spread
out around the country,

477
00:24:52,093 --> 00:24:55,129
and we will assemble, test,
and retest every single one

478
00:24:55,262 --> 00:24:57,765
until we are certain that
Apollo 11 will take off

479
00:24:57,898 --> 00:25:01,002
without a hitch and
head to the moon in...

480
00:25:01,469 --> 00:25:02,703
Henry, sing it.

481
00:25:03,337 --> 00:25:05,306
Seven months. Huh?

482
00:25:05,439 --> 00:25:06,540
Seven months.

483
00:25:06,674 --> 00:25:07,775
Please help me congratulate

484
00:25:07,908 --> 00:25:10,611
the astronauts of Apollo 11.

485
00:25:10,745 --> 00:25:14,281
Armstrong, Aldrin and Collins.

486
00:25:14,415 --> 00:25:16,650
[cheering]

487
00:25:25,026 --> 00:25:28,662
Hey, hey! How'd you like
the White House, boys? Huh?

488
00:25:28,796 --> 00:25:31,999
Yeah, it was all right, except Neil
wouldn't let me steal the china.

489
00:25:32,133 --> 00:25:34,035
- [KSC Apollo Team laughs]
- [Henry chuckles]

490
00:25:34,168 --> 00:25:39,273
All right. Because in eight
months, when this is all over,

491
00:25:39,407 --> 00:25:42,777
and they need new history books to
cover what we've accomplished here,

492
00:25:42,910 --> 00:25:45,746
each and every single one of
you will be able to say that

493
00:25:45,880 --> 00:25:50,885
"I did the hardest thing that

Yeah!

- Yeah.
- Sir,

He's got my name and my job!

Right. What is it that we can do

Kelly, ABC wants next
week's press reel.

516
00:26:41,669 --> 00:26:43,829
They also want the best photo
we have from the Apollo 8.

517
00:26:43,871 --> 00:26:46,551
Tell them they can have it if they
give us their 6:00 p.m. time slot.

518
00:26:46,674 --> 00:26:48,976
- Got it.
- If you air an animated segment,

Yeah, I don't
care. Who is that?

<i>Thank you. See
you on the moon.</i>

To the world,
that's Henry Smalls.

527
00:27:01,255 --> 00:27:03,135
- That's not Henry Smalls.
- No, but you told me

528
00:27:03,190 --> 00:27:06,060
that your guys don't do interviews,
so I had to hire new guys.

529
00:27:08,162 --> 00:27:11,265
You have two of the best engineers
on the planet installing a window.

00:27:11,398 --> 00:27:13,910
Phil, if you hammer one more time, I
swear to God I'm gonna lose my mind.

531
00:27:13,934 --> 00:27:17,638
Put down the hammer, take your stupid
belts off and get back to testing.

532
00:27:19,073 --> 00:27:20,374
On the move. Here we go.

Can you believe that view?

534
00:27:22,276 --> 00:27:24,254
- We got the first photos from Apollo 8.
- It's better than mine.

The first shot of the
Earth from the moon.

thing you've ever seen?

How'd you get this before me?

00:27:29,950 --> 00:27:31,520
They're calling
it "Earthrise."

539
00:27:31,652 --> 00:27:33,933
It's going to be at the top
of every news segment tonight.

540
00:27:33,988 --> 00:27:35,689
I mean, '68 has been
such a terrible year.

541
00:27:35,823 --> 00:27:38,560
Assassinations, this heinous war,
we've seen the worst of humanity.

542
00:27:38,692 --> 00:27:42,263
Now NASA gives us this? A
whole new way to see the world.

543
00:27:44,064 --> 00:27:46,233
And I'm gonna make
sure everybody sees it.

544
00:27:48,869 --> 00:27:51,272
You can't just fake people!

00:27:51,405 --> 00:27:53,941
- Hey, I'm here for the casting.
- Oh!

00:27:55,876 --> 00:27:58,712
- Who's he?
- You. You're a juicy part.

So, here's the scenes
and the character bio.

548
00:28:00,781 --> 00:28:03,360
This is the man that you're playing,
so you wanna up the charisma a bit.

- Can do. I'll up the...
- Okay? Okay.

550
00:28:04,952 --> 00:28:07,054
- Sixty missions in Korea?
- Yeah.

551
00:28:07,188 --> 00:28:10,457
- [chuckles] It's an honor.
- I flew 52 missions in Korea.

552
00:28:10,592 --> 00:28:11,825
I rounded up.

553
00:28:12,893 --> 00:28:16,997
"I flew 52 missions in
Korea." How was that?

554
00:28:18,032 --> 00:28:19,733
- What?
- I'll work on it.

555
00:28:23,572 --> 00:28:25,005
She has a fake me now.

556
00:28:25,139 --> 00:28:27,509
- She got a fake me.
- She got a fake me and a fake you.

557
00:28:27,642 --> 00:28:29,419
- You can't fake me and you.
- There's nothing here.

00:28:29,443 --> 00:28:32,880
There's no Moe Berkus. I
checked every spelling.

559

I have a Moe Berkus on the line.

00:28:38,152 --> 00:28:40,622
-Do you want me to talk?
-Oh, no, no. I'm gonna enjoy this.

561
00:28:40,788 --> 00:28:43,357
This is gonna be the fastest
firing in NASA's history.

562
00:28:43,490 --> 00:28:46,860
- Hey, Moe.
- Cole, I hear you're looking for me.

563
00:28:46,994 --> 00:28:50,197
I am. Kelly Jones hired
actors to play NASA engineers.

564
00:28:50,331 --> 00:28:53,734
It is unacceptable. I want
her desk cleared today.

Calm, calm, calm down, okay?

why don't you just slip on
your tutu and do some dancing?

573
00:29:25,567 --> 00:29:27,501
- She fired?
- Mm-mmm.

574
00:29:29,937 --> 00:29:31,305

Nothing says NASA like
Fruit of the Loom.

Look, I am not turning this

no matter how much
you want it to happen.

Everyone is just a

Look, I know that you're a big
old fancy ad shark and everything,

sell with a jingle and a slogan.

- Who's JoAnn Morgan?
- She works in the firing room.

639
00:32:23,711 --> 00:32:26,614
Did you ever ask her why she took
this job in the first place? I have.

640
00:32:26,748 --> 00:32:29,751
She says it's because she
has rocket fuel in her blood.

641
00:32:29,884 --> 00:32:32,085
And NASA's not just
a logo, it's people.

the impossible.

[sighs] No. If we get
the money flowing,

- Yes! Deal! Yes! Whoo!

Uh, no, wait. I'm drawing the
line at toilet paper though,

664

most like to go, uh...

Lose the table
next time, Walter.

All right, Harrison.

No. I just said
it's impossible.

why the Soviets aren't
broadcasting their space walks.

803
00:40:32,233 --> 00:40:34,335
Because they're a
tight-lipped dictatorship.

- Yeah, that's not us.
- Wow.

do it as a nation.

806
00:40:37,738 --> 00:40:39,907
- And when we fail, we grieve as a nation.
- Right.

00:40:40,041 --> 00:40:41,742
That's what it means
to be American.

808

Oh, stop telling me what
it means to be an American.

There's only one of us here that has
served their country their entire life.

810
00:40:51,118 --> 00:40:53,721
I'm sorry. We're not putting
the camera on the LEM.

811
00:40:59,293 --> 00:41:00,761
I mean it. We're not.

812
00:41:02,897 --> 00:41:03,931
We are.

do it without more fuel.

- Have him run it again.
- Yeah.

816
00:41:24,518 --> 00:41:26,821
Okay. [sighs] I'm on a
tight schedule. What is it?

817
00:41:26,954 --> 00:41:30,992
Kelly briefed me on the
camera idea, and we like it.

818
00:41:31,125 --> 00:41:32,760
We like it a lot.

819
00:41:32,893 --> 00:41:34,996
-She misspoke. We can't do it.
-[chuckles]

820
00:41:35,129 --> 00:41:38,199
There is no such technology
that even exists.

821
00:41:38,332 --> 00:41:39,667
Actually it does. You know?

822
00:41:39,800 --> 00:41:43,304
The Department of
Defense designed this

823
00:41:43,437 --> 00:41:46,841
to find downed fighter
pilots in Vietnam at night.

824
00:41:46,974 --> 00:41:51,545
Now, it's classified but the
DOD is going to let you use it

825
00:41:51,679 --> 00:41:53,214
as long as nobody
knows what it is.

826
00:41:53,347 --> 00:41:55,549
There's absolutely no space
for equipment that heavy.

827
00:41:55,683 --> 00:41:57,351
We are weighing
screws for God's sake.

828
00:41:57,485 --> 00:41:59,053
What... I mean, what
is this, 15 pounds?

829
00:41:59,186 --> 00:42:00,955
Okay. So, just,
like, lighter screws.

830
00:42:01,088 --> 00:42:03,157
We're trying for
another fuel cell.

831
00:42:03,290 --> 00:42:07,728
So our men, when they get to the moon,
they still have enough fuel to lift off.

832
00:42:07,862 --> 00:42:11,165
Out of all her bad ideas,
this one is the worst.

833
00:42:11,999 --> 00:42:14,468
Actually, the
president loves it.

834
00:42:14,602 --> 00:42:16,937
So, now it's a great idea.

835
00:42:17,071 --> 00:42:19,707
So, let me put it
to you simply, Cole.

836
00:42:19,840 --> 00:42:22,511
Find a way to put this on that.

837
00:42:22,643 --> 00:42:26,080
This is an order.
From the tippy top.

838
00:42:33,120 --> 00:42:34,955
[Cole sighs]

839
00:42:37,124 --> 00:42:39,927
Don, Stu. Can you
come in here, please?

840
00:42:43,130 --> 00:42:46,567
Thank you. Let's not
make everything so hard.

841
00:42:48,402 --> 00:42:51,739
Please help Miss Jones strip
this top secret camera down.

842
00:42:51,872 --> 00:42:54,075
I don't want 'em to
know it's top secret.

843
00:42:54,208 --> 00:42:55,076
Well, now they do.

844
00:42:55,209 --> 00:42:56,811
Please strip this
top secret camera.

845
00:42:56,944 --> 00:42:59,980
Mount it onto the LEM
for live broadcasting.

846
00:43:01,516 --> 00:43:03,884
[Moe] Cole. One last thing.

847
00:43:04,018 --> 00:43:08,889
Last week, a CIA spy plane took
some surveillance photographs

848
00:43:09,023 --> 00:43:11,692
of the new Russian N1 rocket.

849
00:43:11,826 --> 00:43:13,260
And Congress saw it,

850
00:43:13,394 --> 00:43:16,163
and some of the members
are having cold feet

851
00:43:16,297 --> 00:43:18,899
- about the final round of funding.
- [sighs]

852
00:43:19,033 --> 00:43:20,835
We're months away from
winning this thing.

853
00:43:20,968 --> 00:43:22,236
I'm gonna send them down here,

854
00:43:22,369 --> 00:43:25,473
and you're gonna convince
them to sit tight.

855
00:43:25,606 --> 00:43:27,975
No. I'm... I'm gonna write
up some talking points.

856
00:43:28,109 --> 00:43:29,143
Huh.

857
00:43:37,384 --> 00:43:39,220
Don't take it personally.

858
00:43:39,353 --> 00:43:43,157
Pilots fight gravity.
It's part of their nature.

859
00:43:45,426 --> 00:43:46,694
[sighs]

860
00:43:48,762 --> 00:43:50,998
[engine starting]

861
00:44:05,246 --> 00:44:06,280
Henry?

862
00:44:08,215 --> 00:44:09,683
Oh. [chuckles]

863
00:44:11,252 --> 00:44:13,354
Well, I'm... I'm
glad you're not Cole.

864
00:44:13,487 --> 00:44:14,655
- Oh?
- Yeah.

865
00:44:14,788 --> 00:44:16,390
- [chuckles]
- He don't like me smoking.

866
00:44:16,525 --> 00:44:18,993
[chuckles] What, are you
worried he's gonna ground you?

867
00:44:19,126 --> 00:44:20,261
[chuckles]

868
00:44:21,462 --> 00:44:25,634
Uh, no. I, uh... [chuckles] I had
emergency bypass surgery last year.

869
00:44:25,766 --> 00:44:29,470
Yeah. That son of a bitch. He's
hell-bent on keeping me alive.

870
00:44:29,604 --> 00:44:31,038
I'm sorry. I didn't know.

871
00:44:31,172 --> 00:44:33,174
[sighs] Yeah.
Nobody here does.

872
00:44:33,307 --> 00:44:34,875
Just Cole.

873
00:44:35,009 --> 00:44:40,014
Yeah. He came to the hospital and
held my wife's hand for three days.

874
00:44:41,949 --> 00:44:44,485
Yeah. It's a long way
from the day we met.

875
00:44:44,619 --> 00:44:46,353
[sighs]

876
00:44:47,788 --> 00:44:49,823
Kid had just got
back from Korea.

877
00:44:50,791 --> 00:44:53,127
The top pilot in the Air Force.

878
00:44:53,761 --> 00:44:56,063
Silver Star. Flying Cross.

879
00:44:57,331 --> 00:45:00,868
He was first in line at Edwards when
they were looking for astronauts.

880
00:45:01,001 --> 00:45:04,905
But, uh, he ended up
not making the cut.

881
00:45:07,041 --> 00:45:10,277
So, what got him?
It was his temper.

882
00:45:11,011 --> 00:45:14,215
[chuckles] No, no. His heart.

883
00:45:14,348 --> 00:45:15,617
Doc found an A-fib.

884
00:45:15,749 --> 00:45:20,020
A little thing but enough to
keep him out of the program.

885
00:45:21,288 --> 00:45:24,458
Cole Davis is the best pilot
who will never get to space.

886
00:45:38,607 --> 00:45:43,210
You know, I've been looking at this
view every day for the last 15 years.

887
00:45:43,344 --> 00:45:48,082
But lately, it's like I'm
seeing it for the first time.

888
00:45:50,384 --> 00:45:54,455
Apollo 1 cast a big
shadow on this place.

889
00:45:57,258 --> 00:46:00,494
It's nice to have some
light back. [sighs]

890
00:46:09,169 --> 00:46:12,106
Hey, I keep seeing Cole
drive out there every night.

891
00:46:14,174 --> 00:46:15,409
What's he doing?

892
00:46:19,380 --> 00:46:20,414
Gardening.

893
00:46:46,307 --> 00:46:47,341
[sighs]

894
00:47:00,655 --> 00:47:02,222
[engine starts]

895
00:47:40,461 --> 00:47:43,197
- [Henry] You ready?
- Yeah. [sighs]

896
00:47:44,599 --> 00:47:45,633
[Henry sighs]

897
00:47:50,170 --> 00:47:52,373
All right. Look, we just...
We give the senator a tour.

898
00:47:52,507 --> 00:47:56,243
We play nice for 30 minutes.
We keep the lights on.

899
00:47:56,944 --> 00:47:58,112
[sighing] Okay. Fine.

900
00:47:58,245 --> 00:47:59,446
[gasps] Oh. [shushes]

901
00:47:59,581 --> 00:48:01,221
- [Henry] What?
- [Cole] She's just there.

902
00:48:01,281 --> 00:48:02,751
- Don't run.
- No, no. [shushes]

903
00:48:02,883 --> 00:48:05,003
- Just don't run. Don't...
- Wait. [shushing] Shut up.

904
00:48:05,252 --> 00:48:06,487
No. See, you scared it.

905
00:48:06,621 --> 00:48:07,655
[Henry] I just ate.

906
00:48:12,527 --> 00:48:16,096
Henry, come on! Come
on! [breathes heavily]

907
00:48:21,101 --> 00:48:22,236
I hate that cat. [pants]

908
00:48:22,369 --> 00:48:24,739
[pants] I see what
y... you mean. [pants]

909
00:48:24,873 --> 00:48:26,775
That's an asshole cat. [pants]

910
00:48:26,907 --> 00:48:28,187
Did you see the look it gave me?

911
00:48:28,308 --> 00:48:30,244
- [sighs]
- It's just taunting me now.

912
00:48:31,111 --> 00:48:33,347
- What is that?
- [pants] That's cat food.

913
00:48:33,480 --> 00:48:35,550
- Somebody's feeding that thing.
- Who's doing that?

914
00:48:35,683 --> 00:48:38,452
Find them. [pants] Find them
immediately, and fire them immediately.

915
00:48:38,586 --> 00:48:41,121
Mr. Davis. Sir, uh,
Senator Hopp is here.

916
00:48:41,255 --> 00:48:42,891
All right. What?
You look fine.

917
00:48:43,056 --> 00:48:44,391
[sighs] Senator.

918
00:48:44,526 --> 00:48:46,436
-Hello, Mr. Davis.
-[Henry] Senator. What an honor.

919
00:48:46,460 --> 00:48:49,430
- [Cole] It's an honor and a pleasure.
- Very nice to see you.

920
00:48:51,833 --> 00:48:53,768
[Cole] Well, the Apollo
11 capsule has arrived,

921
00:48:53,902 --> 00:48:57,337
and next week, we will be attaching
it to the Saturn V rocket.

922
00:48:57,471 --> 00:49:00,909
And that gets us off the ground
and out of Earth's atmosphere.

923
00:49:01,041 --> 00:49:05,345
Well, that's all very impressive,
but I have to be up-front.

924
00:49:05,479 --> 00:49:08,583
Georgia had some devastating
floods this year.

925
00:49:08,716 --> 00:49:12,052
And I'm voting to put this
money toward our relief fund.

926
00:49:12,186 --> 00:49:13,898
That seems a little
selfish, don't you think?

927
00:49:13,922 --> 00:49:16,490
- Excuse me?
- Uh, that's a figure of speech.

928
00:49:16,624 --> 00:49:19,159
- Here's what he means.
- My voters mostly think

929
00:49:19,293 --> 00:49:21,663
we are overspending on the moon.

930
00:49:21,796 --> 00:49:23,473
- [Cole] That's funny, because...
- [Kelly] Yoo-hoo!

931
00:49:23,497 --> 00:49:25,432
[in Southern accent]
Excuse me. Senator Hopp.

932
00:49:25,567 --> 00:49:27,968
Oh, you probably
don't remember me,

933
00:49:28,101 --> 00:49:31,104
but you spoke at my
sophomore year of college.

934
00:49:31,238 --> 00:49:33,440
Georgia Tech. '55.

935
00:49:33,575 --> 00:49:34,576
You're a Buzz?

936
00:49:34,709 --> 00:49:36,744
- [chuckles] Yes, sir.
- Of course I remember.

937
00:49:36,878 --> 00:49:38,713
Your words inspired me that day.

938
00:49:38,847 --> 00:49:42,650
You said, "Commitment means
staying loyal to a cause."

939
00:49:42,784 --> 00:49:46,588
Two years later, I graduated with
honors. Now I run this department.

940
00:49:46,721 --> 00:49:49,591
You know, in '62, you
said that you would fight

941
00:49:49,724 --> 00:49:52,627
for Kennedy's dream
no matter what.

942
00:49:52,760 --> 00:49:55,864
I know that the moon mission
was more popular back then,

943
00:49:55,996 --> 00:49:59,366
but it would be just a shame

944
00:49:59,500 --> 00:50:03,671
if the man whose words
inspired me to work at NASA

945
00:50:03,805 --> 00:50:06,608
didn't live by those
very same words.

946
00:50:08,308 --> 00:50:09,878
It would be a
shame, wouldn't it?

947
00:50:10,010 --> 00:50:12,379
Sir, you are just
such a wonderful man.

948
00:50:12,514 --> 00:50:13,715
- Thank you so much.
- Mmm.

949
00:50:13,848 --> 00:50:15,148
You are a wonderful man.

950
00:50:15,282 --> 00:50:17,084
Isn't she just a wonderful
Georgia peach here?

951
00:50:17,217 --> 00:50:18,217
- Oh, my.
- Oh. Yes.

952
00:50:18,318 --> 00:50:20,087
- You are so sweet.
- Yes, I am.

953
00:50:20,220 --> 00:50:24,291
Let me take you on the special VIP
tour they didn't tell you about.

954
00:50:24,424 --> 00:50:26,260
- Oh, I'd love that.
- [chuckles] Wonderful.

955
00:50:26,393 --> 00:50:28,262
Do you go on this tour with me?

956
00:50:28,395 --> 00:50:29,898
[Kelly] I absolutely will.

957
00:50:30,030 --> 00:50:31,398
[Hopp] That's so sweet.

958
00:50:31,533 --> 00:50:33,635
[Henry] She teared up.
I mean, it's scary.

959
00:50:35,269 --> 00:50:36,504
Wave and smile.

960
00:50:37,739 --> 00:50:38,540
Bye-bye!

Looks like it's not
gonna be Vanning.

968
00:50:58,292 --> 00:51:01,663
- Definitely not Vanning.
- Next, we have Senator Cook.

969
00:51:01,796 --> 00:51:03,531
Cook's a little scary.
I'm not gonna lie.

970
00:51:03,665 --> 00:51:05,432
He's a Cold War conservative.

971
00:51:05,567 --> 00:51:08,201
He's worried that our
budget takes away from

973
00:51:11,973 --> 00:51:13,741

his state party not to fund.

few of those around here.

00:52:03,691 --> 00:52:04,726
Any questions?

992
00:52:04,859 --> 00:52:06,293
No, ma'am.

993
00:52:06,426 --> 00:52:08,328

Senator. Apollo 10 will
just be orbiting the moon.

1002
00:52:30,217 --> 00:52:33,755
But it's gonna get us information
critical for the touchdown of 11.

1003
00:52:33,888 --> 00:52:35,990
- Like landing conditions and location.
- Amazing.

1004
00:52:36,124 --> 00:52:38,684
And we've a special seat for you
here, Senator, amongst your fans.

Uh, Senator, I'm
the very last person

that you want in

do interviews.

and secured the launch.

And that's why you broke
into my motel room?

1117

She was the twin sister of
Apollo, uh, you know, the backup.

1125
00:59:52,561 --> 00:59:57,031
So we just need to be ready
to shoot a little picture.

1126
00:59:57,164 --> 01:00:01,735

know, up there walking around,

1127
01:00:01,869 --> 01:00:03,370
waving at the camera.

1128
01:00:03,505 --> 01:00:07,041
- You mean, to fake it?
- All goes well, we never use it.

1129
01:00:08,175 --> 01:00:09,243
But if not...

1130
01:00:11,312 --> 01:00:12,346
Hmm.

1131
01:00:14,215 --> 01:00:16,016
You know why I never
went to prison?

1132
01:00:16,150 --> 01:00:19,787
[chuckles] Probably,
but humor me.

1133
01:00:19,920 --> 01:00:21,489
'Cause I quit while I'm ahead.

1134
01:00:21,622 --> 01:00:24,859
Can't keep a secret this big.
Thousands of people work here.

1135
01:00:26,627 --> 01:00:31,298
Well, thousands of people work at
a classified location in the desert

1136

of extraterrestrial pods

1137
01:00:35,736 --> 01:00:37,972
that we found at the
bottom of the ocean.

1138
01:00:38,105 --> 01:00:40,708
And you never heard
about that, did ya?

1139
01:00:40,841 --> 01:00:43,677
[chuckles] Come on,
that's not true.

1140
01:00:43,811 --> 01:00:47,848
Uh, maybe it is, maybe it isn't.

1141
01:00:47,982 --> 01:00:50,519
But the one thing
you can be sure of

1142
01:00:50,651 --> 01:00:57,358
is that the world will watch Americans
plant an American flag on the moon.

1143
01:00:57,491 --> 01:01:00,761
And you are telling me that
President Nixon supports this?

1144
01:01:00,895 --> 01:01:04,431
He probably would. He
doesn't know about it

1145
01:01:04,566 --> 01:01:10,471
in the same way that Cole
Davis will never know about it.

1146
01:01:10,605 --> 01:01:12,106
And that shouldn't be a problem

1147
01:01:12,239 --> 01:01:16,076
considering what else you
haven't shared with him

1148
01:01:16,210 --> 01:01:18,712
while you've grown closer.

1149
01:01:19,747 --> 01:01:22,283
I mean, what would a clean-cut
guy like that think about...

1150
01:01:22,416 --> 01:01:23,984
You made your point.

1151
01:01:24,118 --> 01:01:26,787
No one can outrun their past.

1152
01:01:26,921 --> 01:01:31,025
But I can make it
go away. Forever.

1153
01:01:31,560 --> 01:01:32,960
No more running.

1154
01:01:35,129 --> 01:01:36,363
[sighs]

1155
01:01:39,967 --> 01:01:41,335
I'm gonna need my assistant.

1156
01:01:41,468 --> 01:01:42,703
[chuckles]

1157
01:01:43,771 --> 01:01:45,005
Of course.

1158
01:01:45,139 --> 01:01:48,610
And we'll get you a
team of secure agents.

1159
01:01:48,742 --> 01:01:54,782
Now, who's the best director you've
got that no one's ever heard of?

1160
01:01:55,584 --> 01:01:57,818
["It's Your Thing" playing]

1161
01:01:58,986 --> 01:02:00,254
You're gonna love him.

1162
01:02:02,189 --> 01:02:04,091
This is the most remote
hangar on the base.

1163
01:02:04,225 --> 01:02:06,994
No one can go in or out
without my permission.

1164
01:02:07,127 --> 01:02:09,730
Wait, no one? Not even Cole?

1165
01:02:10,864 --> 01:02:12,266
Especially not Cole.

1166
01:02:16,370 --> 01:02:17,505
Unbelievable, Kelly.

1167
01:02:17,639 --> 01:02:20,007
You have me... [grunts]
forced onto a plane,

1168
01:02:20,140 --> 01:02:21,809
and brought to
godforsaken Florida!

1169
01:02:21,942 --> 01:02:23,444
Do you mind?

1170
01:02:23,578 --> 01:02:25,946
I'm a member of the DGA.

1171
01:02:26,080 --> 01:02:28,650
I will not be treated this way.

1172
01:02:28,782 --> 01:02:31,252
- I am calling my agent.
- You can't.

1173
01:02:31,385 --> 01:02:33,387
- Watch me.
- Remember we talked about this.

1174
01:02:33,521 --> 01:02:36,123
This is a high-security
government job.

1175
01:02:36,857 --> 01:02:38,959
- I'm doubling your quote.
- Okay.

1176
01:02:39,093 --> 01:02:40,094
- With a bonus.
- Mmm.

1177
01:02:40,227 --> 01:02:41,962
Yes. The only caveat being

1178
01:02:42,096 --> 01:02:44,965
that no one can ever
know what we're doing.

1179
01:02:45,099 --> 01:02:47,401
- I cannot accept that.
- They will shoot you.

1180
01:02:48,035 --> 01:02:49,036
What is my budget?

1181
01:02:49,169 --> 01:02:51,706
Your budget is whatever it costs

1182
01:02:51,839 --> 01:02:54,743
to turn this into the moon

1183
01:02:54,875 --> 01:02:56,611
for two-and-a-half hours.

1184
01:02:56,745 --> 01:02:58,145
It's shorter than <i>Ben-Hur.</i>

1185
01:02:58,279 --> 01:03:00,147

I will need a fridge
full of Tab over there.

1192
01:03:18,198 --> 01:03:21,402

1198
01:03:35,349 --> 01:03:37,389
- Well, this is the best you're gonna get.
- [grunts]

1199
01:03:37,519 --> 01:03:39,353
Neil's 5'11". Anybody 5'11"?

1200
01:03:39,486 --> 01:03:41,889
Okay. The rest of
you are dismissed.

1201
01:03:42,022 --> 01:03:43,924
- Take your pick.
- Mmm. Hold on. You.

1202
01:03:44,058 --> 01:03:45,335
You're gonna be my
personal assistant.

1203
01:03:45,359 --> 01:03:46,493
I'll just call you Joseph

1204
01:03:46,628 --> 01:03:47,804
so you can't take
things personally.

1205
01:03:47,828 --> 01:03:49,163
Go stand somewhere.

1206
01:03:49,296 --> 01:03:51,274
All right. Can we take these
sunglasses off, please,

1207
01:03:51,298 --> 01:03:54,134
so I can see your eyes
and believe your truth?

1208
01:03:54,268 --> 01:03:55,969
Now, I want each of
you to do a monologue.

1209
01:03:56,103 --> 01:03:59,139
Preferably something
classical, and by God,

1210
01:03:59,273 --> 01:04:00,908
don't make me watch
seven Hamlets.

1211
01:04:01,041 --> 01:04:03,019
You're not gonna see their
faces. They're wearing helmets.

1212
01:04:03,043 --> 01:04:04,945
Wh... [scoffs]

1213
01:04:05,079 --> 01:04:11,820
All right, how do I convey the gripping
fear of being on the moon for the first time

1214
01:04:11,952 --> 01:04:14,154
if we can't show a human face?

1215
01:04:14,288 --> 01:04:15,657
Acting is a sport, Kelly.

1216
01:04:15,790 --> 01:04:18,392
- It is energy, body, bu...
- [person] Where do I set up?

1217
01:04:19,460 --> 01:04:20,961
- Edvard?
- Ah.

1218
01:04:21,095 --> 01:04:23,173
- How did you get in here?
- I just walked through the door.

1219
01:04:23,197 --> 01:04:28,001
What part of "talking about this is gonna
get us killed" do you not understand?

1220
01:04:28,135 --> 01:04:30,775
- And he's the slowest DP in New York.
- I pick the cinematographer.

1221
01:04:30,839 --> 01:04:33,207
- It's in my contract.
- What? You don't have a contract.

1222
01:04:33,340 --> 01:04:34,809
He's the best, and
all DPs are slow.

1223
01:04:34,942 --> 01:04:38,912
What we need to have a serious
conversation about, Kelly,

1224
01:04:39,046 --> 01:04:41,148
is production design, hmm?

1225
01:04:41,281 --> 01:04:44,318
What materials are we using
to recreate the lunar surface?

1226
01:04:44,451 --> 01:04:46,286
It's just a big rock, right?

1227
01:04:54,361 --> 01:04:56,463
I can't work like this, Kelly.

1228
01:04:57,799 --> 01:04:59,667
You know this about me. Hmm?

1229
01:04:59,801 --> 01:05:01,168
I need details.

1230
01:05:01,301 --> 01:05:03,571
We need details. Specifics.

1231
01:05:03,705 --> 01:05:07,742
Is it dusty, rocky, windy?
What is the light source? Hmm?

1232
01:05:07,876 --> 01:05:11,713
- It's the sun. Big light.
- Do not smart-mouth me, Edvard.

1233
01:05:11,846 --> 01:05:15,550
And what is the sun's position
in relation to the landing area?

1234
01:05:15,683 --> 01:05:17,619
And are we building a
replica? Do we have a plan?

1235
01:05:17,752 --> 01:05:21,255
Do we have suits, and how do
people move in those suits?

1236
01:05:21,388 --> 01:05:23,892
And what, Kelly, does
space even look like?

1237
01:05:24,024 --> 01:05:25,894
You know, I gotta...
[sighs] I gotta lie down.

1238
01:05:26,026 --> 01:05:28,630
Where is my trailer? [sighs]

1239
01:05:30,799 --> 01:05:34,435
We need to find a way to copy
everything in that simulation room.

1240
01:05:34,569 --> 01:05:35,936
- Okay.
- ASAP.

1241
01:05:36,069 --> 01:05:38,305
Wait a second. Do I
even have a trailer?

1242
01:05:39,206 --> 01:05:41,108
Your silence tells me
what I already know.

1243
01:05:41,241 --> 01:05:43,241
You haven't thought about
how to recreate the moon,

1244
01:05:43,277 --> 01:05:44,522
why would you think
about a trailer?

1245
01:05:44,546 --> 01:05:46,180
I think we should've
gotten Kubrick.

1246
01:05:46,313 --> 01:05:48,081
[Henry] We've got to
get this new ship right.

1247
01:05:48,215 --> 01:05:49,684
I mean, Armstrong,
he was pissed off

1248
01:05:49,818 --> 01:05:51,619
- and we can't have that again.
- Sorry.

1249
01:05:53,020 --> 01:05:54,354
Buddy, buddy.

1250
01:05:54,488 --> 01:05:56,166
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
This is sensitive material.

1251
01:05:56,190 --> 01:05:57,870
- Henry. Henry.
- Uh-uh. You can't be here.

1252
01:05:57,926 --> 01:06:00,628
These photos are for the archival
book that Penguin is doing.

1253
01:06:00,762 --> 01:06:02,482
- What book?
- Yeah, didn't you get the memo?

1254
01:06:02,597 --> 01:06:04,231
- No.
- What? You're writing the foreword.

1255
01:06:04,364 --> 01:06:06,901
- I... I'm writing the foreword?
- Yeah, absolutely.

1256
01:06:07,034 --> 01:06:08,335
- Me?
- Yes, of course.

1257
01:06:08,469 --> 01:06:09,613
I've never written a foreword.

1258
01:06:09,637 --> 01:06:10,957
The editor wants
to hear from you.

1259
01:06:11,071 --> 01:06:12,807
- We all do.
- He wants me to write it?

1260
01:06:12,941 --> 01:06:14,451
Don't be so humble, all right?
Let's get a photo of you with the...

1261
01:06:14,475 --> 01:06:16,119
- with the LEM.
- I mean, I can do it, but...

1262
01:06:16,143 --> 01:06:17,344
Say, "we're going
to the moon."

1263
01:06:17,478 --> 01:06:19,179
- We're going to the moon.
- There you go!

1264
01:06:19,313 --> 01:06:23,050
Aldrin and Armstrong will practice
every single movement that they make,

1265
01:06:23,183 --> 01:06:24,953
um, right here for months.

1266
01:06:25,085 --> 01:06:26,253
- That is incredible.
- Yeah.

1267
01:06:26,386 --> 01:06:28,455
So, this is, like, the
surface of the moon?

1268
01:06:28,590 --> 01:06:29,757
- Well, yeah. It's...
- Yeah.

1269
01:06:29,891 --> 01:06:31,458
It's our best approximation.

1270
01:06:31,593 --> 01:06:33,874
This just looks like a dirty
beach. I don't believe it. No.

1271
01:06:33,928 --> 01:06:35,964
- It is... It's based off sediment we got.
- Joseph.

1272
01:06:36,096 --> 01:06:36,898
It's from NASA...

1273
01:06:37,030 --> 01:06:38,499
Wait. I do not believe

1274
01:06:38,633 --> 01:06:39,633
this is what NASA uses

1275
01:06:39,734 --> 01:06:41,736
to go to the moon. You
cannot tell me... No.

1276
01:06:41,870 --> 01:06:46,006
Want you to walk as if you're carrying
your mother across the desert.

1277
01:06:46,139 --> 01:06:49,376
She's frail but also heavy.

1278
01:06:49,511 --> 01:06:50,912
Oh. Whoa. Hey.

1279
01:06:51,044 --> 01:06:52,647
- So sorry. Hey. Sorry.
- Oh, no, no. No.

1280
01:06:52,780 --> 01:06:54,658
-This is classified. You're not allow...
-Stu, we're good.

1281
01:06:54,682 --> 01:06:56,159
-Very classified.
-We're good here. This is for the book.

1282
01:06:56,183 --> 01:06:57,183
No, you'll hear about it.

1283
01:06:57,251 --> 01:06:58,452
I'm doing the foreword,

1284
01:06:58,586 --> 01:06:59,996
- so you'll hear about it soon.
- Okay.

1285
01:07:00,020 --> 01:07:01,331
My Armstrong is a
whiny, little bitch.

1286
01:07:01,355 --> 01:07:02,355
We have to recast.

1287
01:07:02,389 --> 01:07:03,892
No... We're not recasting.

1288
01:07:04,024 --> 01:07:06,126
All right. Well,
mediocre it is.

1289
01:07:06,260 --> 01:07:09,029
Edvard! Where is my sun?

1290
01:07:09,664 --> 01:07:10,497
- [yells]
- Nice!

1291
01:07:10,632 --> 01:07:12,534
- Very nice.
- A countdown at least.

1292
01:07:12,667 --> 01:07:13,968
Okay. Try it again.

1293
01:07:14,101 --> 01:07:15,779
- Gonna try it again.
- Do a three, two, one!

1294
01:07:15,803 --> 01:07:16,803
- Come on! Ah!
- Happy?

1295
01:07:16,871 --> 01:07:18,773
J... Joseph, bring me my Tab.

1296
01:07:18,907 --> 01:07:21,174
You're gonna have to find me
'cause I can't see a thing.

1297
01:07:21,308 --> 01:07:23,386
Come on. How long does it
take to give someone a Tab?

1298
01:07:23,410 --> 01:07:24,879
My hand's right here.

1299
01:07:25,013 --> 01:07:26,857
Uh, this will be great. You
guys should all come around

1300
01:07:26,881 --> 01:07:28,917
- and we'll do a shot for the book.
- Great?

1301
01:07:29,049 --> 01:07:31,719
Hey, how about this? Everybody,
"We're going to the moon!"

1302
01:07:31,853 --> 01:07:34,488
We're going to the moon!

1303
01:07:34,622 --> 01:07:37,825
[Henry] My eyes might have been
closed. You wanna do one more?

1304
01:07:40,327 --> 01:07:42,964
[sighs] I haven't seen
you around lately.

1305
01:07:43,096 --> 01:07:44,999
Well, I can say the
same thing about you.

1306
01:07:45,132 --> 01:07:46,534
[chuckles]

1307
01:07:46,668 --> 01:07:48,536
[sighs] How do you do
it on the first try?

1308
01:07:48,670 --> 01:07:52,172
[chuckles] It's not rocket
science. Okay. You good?

1309
01:07:53,240 --> 01:07:54,560
- About the questions, I...
- Yes.

1310
01:07:54,642 --> 01:07:55,743
I went over them.

1311
01:07:55,877 --> 01:07:58,846
Nothing about Apollo 1.
They promised me. Okay?

1312
01:08:00,180 --> 01:08:01,916
You're gonna be great. Okay?

1313
01:08:02,050 --> 01:08:03,116
- Mm-hmm.
- Go on.

1314
01:08:03,250 --> 01:08:04,484
- Okay.
- Go.

1315
01:08:06,721 --> 01:08:09,791
Mr. Davis. You are what
we call "a tough get."

1316
01:08:09,924 --> 01:08:10,924
Ha! No. Thank you.

1317
01:08:10,992 --> 01:08:12,794
Is there any legal importance

1318
01:08:12,927 --> 01:08:14,461
to what we'll be watching

1319
01:08:14,596 --> 01:08:17,599
when Neil Armstrong and Buzz
Aldrin walk on the lunar surface?

1320
01:08:17,732 --> 01:08:21,636
Will the area they land on be considered
property of the United States?

1321
01:08:21,769 --> 01:08:23,403
[Cole] We're sending
a plaque that says,

1322
01:08:23,538 --> 01:08:25,372
"We came in peace
for all mankind."

1323
01:08:25,506 --> 01:08:27,041
And that is precisely
what we mean.

1324
01:08:27,174 --> 01:08:29,409
What else will
NASA leave behind?

1325
01:08:29,544 --> 01:08:31,946
Footprints, an American
flag and 12 bags of feces

1326
01:08:32,080 --> 01:08:33,380
that I was told many times

1327
01:08:33,514 --> 01:08:34,925
- that I should not bring up, but...
- [chuckles]

1328
01:08:34,949 --> 01:08:36,884
Should've put him in
front of a camera sooner.

1329
01:08:37,018 --> 01:08:38,653

1330
01:08:39,721 --> 01:08:41,055
I do. Um,

1331
01:08:41,188 --> 01:08:43,625
the wives of Apollo 1's men,

1332
01:08:44,592 --> 01:08:46,594
after we lost them,
they gave me this.

1333
01:08:46,728 --> 01:08:49,897
You were launch director
on that tragic day.

1334
01:08:50,598 --> 01:08:53,568
What went wrong with Apollo 1?

1335
01:08:56,571 --> 01:08:59,741
- In your own words, what happened?
- [scoffs]

1336
01:09:01,174 --> 01:09:02,442
Take me back.

1337
01:09:06,413 --> 01:09:09,383
Okay. Here's some
facts for you.

1338
01:09:09,517 --> 01:09:10,952
The <i>New York Times</i> reported

1339
01:09:11,085 --> 01:09:13,286
there were 20,000 safety
reports filed about that ship.

1340
01:09:13,420 --> 01:09:17,357
So many, that Gus Grissom
hung a lemon outside it.

1341
01:09:19,393 --> 01:09:22,295
[mission controller] <i>All right,
crew. To be confirmed. Location.</i>

1342
01:09:22,429 --> 01:09:25,767
- [Grissom] <i>Flame!</i>
- [Chaffee] <i>We've got a fire in the cockpit.</i>

1343
01:09:25,900 --> 01:09:27,001
<i>Let's get out!</i>

1344
01:09:27,135 --> 01:09:29,302
Mr. Davis? Did you
read those reports?

1345
01:09:29,436 --> 01:09:31,682
[mission controller] <i>Pad leader,
get in there and help 'em.</i>

1346
01:09:31,706 --> 01:09:34,474
[mission controller]
<i>Pad leader, stay on C3.</i>

1347
01:09:40,081 --> 01:09:42,884
[interviewer] Mr. Davis?
Did you read those reports?

1348
01:09:44,852 --> 01:09:49,256
- Did you read those reports?
- Of course I read the reports.

1349
01:09:49,389 --> 01:09:51,626
I read every single one of them.

1350
01:09:51,759 --> 01:09:55,663
Overpressured oxygen and a bad
wire on a "plugs-out" test.

1351
01:09:55,797 --> 01:09:57,397
I was supposed to
catch everything,

1352
01:09:57,532 --> 01:09:59,701
and I missed it.
And I failed them.

1353
01:09:59,834 --> 01:10:02,570
And I will live with that every
single day for the rest of my life.

1354
01:10:02,704 --> 01:10:05,338
Is that the quote that you were
looking for, you piece of shit?

1355
01:10:05,472 --> 01:10:08,176
Get me on the phone with
your boss. Now. Now!

1356
01:10:08,308 --> 01:10:12,046
Oh, uh, wait. W-What are you
doing? We have another 20 minutes.

1357
01:10:12,180 --> 01:10:13,180
Go to hell.

1358
01:10:13,246 --> 01:10:14,515
Don't be angry with me.

1359
01:10:14,649 --> 01:10:16,409
I'm not the reason three
astronauts are dead.

1360
01:10:20,320 --> 01:10:22,633
- Say one more thing about those astronauts.
- Hey, hey, hey! Whoa!

1361
01:10:22,657 --> 01:10:24,568
Get off me. Let me hear
you say one more thing...

1362
01:10:24,592 --> 01:10:26,335
Let me hear you say one
more thing about them!

1363
01:10:26,359 --> 01:10:28,539
You don't know those men! You
don't talk about those men!

1364
01:10:28,563 --> 01:10:30,263
Get off me! Get off!

1365
01:10:30,397 --> 01:10:31,498
Get off!

1366
01:10:31,632 --> 01:10:33,366
Do you understand me?

1367
01:10:39,841 --> 01:10:42,910
So, I spoke to the producers, and
they've agreed to seal the film

1368
01:10:43,044 --> 01:10:46,981
if we give them the exclusive
with Armstrong after he lands.

1369
01:10:49,382 --> 01:10:50,618
[sighs]

1370
01:10:51,886 --> 01:10:54,421
We lost Hedges though.
He's voting no.

1371
01:10:54,555 --> 01:10:59,527
- You said they wouldn't ask about it.
- Yeah. Well... they lied.

1372
01:10:59,660 --> 01:11:01,105
You know, people do
that sometimes, Cole.

1373
01:11:01,129 --> 01:11:03,209
You could have done yourself
and this program a favor

1374
01:11:03,330 --> 01:11:05,233
and maybe tried it
yourself. Right?

1375
01:11:05,365 --> 01:11:07,101
- Blame NASA.
- [scoffs]

1376
01:11:07,235 --> 01:11:08,936
Blame the system.

1377
01:11:09,070 --> 01:11:11,749
I mean, there was half a billion
dollars worth of funding on the line.

1378
01:11:11,773 --> 01:11:14,017
Lying must be so easy for you
when you do it all the time.

1379
01:11:14,041 --> 01:11:16,385
It's just always an option. What
you should try is the truth.

1380
01:11:16,409 --> 01:11:17,809
What is this
sanctimonious bullshit?

1381
01:11:17,912 --> 01:11:20,447
I'm never going to lie
about those men or that day.

1382
01:11:20,581 --> 01:11:21,849
Do you understand that?

1383
01:11:22,583 --> 01:11:24,317
You think what
you want about me,

1384
01:11:24,451 --> 01:11:28,656
but I didn't cost the world a dream
because I lost my goddamn cool.

1385

[tour group
chuckling, chattering]

1386
01:11:56,951 --> 01:12:01,956
This is Launch Complex 34, where
the Apollo 1 tragedy occurred.

1387
01:12:02,089 --> 01:12:04,725
This is a tribute to
our fallen heroes,

1388
01:12:04,859 --> 01:12:08,763
the brave men who paved
the road to our success.

1389
01:12:09,664 --> 01:12:12,533
Please, let's take a
moment of silence for them.

1390
01:12:23,511 --> 01:12:24,988
[Kelly] Edvard, that
looks incredible.

1391
01:12:25,012 --> 01:12:26,690
I can't see the wires at
all. How did you do that?

1392
01:12:26,714 --> 01:12:28,583
I just put a flag.
It's very simple.

1393
01:12:28,716 --> 01:12:29,584
- Old school.
- Huh.

1394
01:12:29,717 --> 01:12:31,919
No. Again. From the top.

1395
01:12:32,053 --> 01:12:34,856

more bounce this time.

1396

down? Actually, leave them up.

about what they did.

Virginia was the mother of Texas.

Well, we never knew
who the father was.

Took the Lord six days to put forth
everything that we know as creation.

1475

And on that sixth day, he
gave us dominion over it.

that as a responsibility.

01:38:43,023 --> 01:38:45,192
Houston, she's all yours.

1806
01:39:07,147 --> 01:39:09,283
[cheering]

1807
01:39:51,391 --> 01:39:53,628
[speaking indistinctly]

1808
01:39:57,264 --> 01:39:59,667
Moe Berkus is here.
For both of you.

1809
01:39:59,801 --> 01:40:02,069
[Walter Cronkite]
<i>Apollo 11 is on the way.</i>

1810
01:40:02,202 --> 01:40:04,606
<i>250,000 miles away,</i>

1811
01:40:04,739 --> 01:40:08,375
<i>where the moon is waiting
for man's first arrival.</i>

1812
01:40:08,510 --> 01:40:10,545
<i>Flight to take, uh, three days.</i>

1813
01:40:10,678 --> 01:40:14,114
<i>And, uh, the, uh,
spacecraft to reach there...</i>

1814
01:40:14,248 --> 01:40:15,683
[Cole] Kelly told
me everything.

1815
01:40:15,817 --> 01:40:18,118
[Walter Cronkite] <i>The landing
to take place on Sunday.</i>

1816
01:40:18,252 --> 01:40:19,521
<i>And Neil Armstrong to set...</i>

1817
01:40:19,654 --> 01:40:20,989
<i>Bravissimo.</i>

1818
01:40:21,121 --> 01:40:22,790
- Shove it.
- That was history.

1819
01:40:22,924 --> 01:40:24,993
Hi, Helen. Uh, sorry, Kelly.

1820
01:40:25,125 --> 01:40:28,630
I heard you came back,
so I came back too.

1821
01:40:30,297 --> 01:40:34,268
I... I took a little
peeky-poo at the moon set,

1822
01:40:34,401 --> 01:40:37,371
and it is perfection.

1823
01:40:37,739 --> 01:40:38,840
Great job.

1824
01:40:38,973 --> 01:40:40,484
If you think that I'm
gonna let you broadcast

1825
01:40:40,508 --> 01:40:41,876
some fake version of this,

1826
01:40:42,010 --> 01:40:43,477
I'll go to the press right now.

1827
01:40:43,611 --> 01:40:45,580
[chuckles] Cole.

1828
01:40:46,113 --> 01:40:48,148
Cole. Cole.

1829
01:40:51,719 --> 01:40:56,591
You, uh... You go to the press.
Bring 'em by the moon set,

1830
01:40:56,724 --> 01:41:02,129
but just know that no one will ever
trust the legitimacy of NASA again.

1831
01:41:02,262 --> 01:41:04,933
This is a matter of
national security.

1832
01:41:05,065 --> 01:41:08,335
This broadcast must take
place in a controlled setting.

1833
01:41:08,468 --> 01:41:10,772
You of all people
must understand that.

1834
01:41:10,905 --> 01:41:15,475
The mission isn't about
landing on the moon anymore.

1835
01:41:15,610 --> 01:41:21,415
It is about the world watching
America beat Russia on TV.

1836
01:41:27,454 --> 01:41:29,222
I got a flight to catch.

1837
01:41:31,291 --> 01:41:35,830
I'll be back in time
for the lunar broadcast.

1838
01:41:35,964 --> 01:41:37,532
I thought I'd watch it here.

1839
01:41:38,165 --> 01:41:40,802
With you, Kelly. On the moon.

1840
01:41:48,610 --> 01:41:51,646
Hey. We're making history.

1841
01:42:14,068 --> 01:42:15,570
[sighs]

1842
01:42:23,845 --> 01:42:26,279
Everything you said
about me is true.

1843
01:42:26,413 --> 01:42:28,482
I'm a con artist, and
I always have been.

1844
01:42:31,485 --> 01:42:33,387
My real name is not even Kelly.

1845
01:42:35,455 --> 01:42:37,825
All those stories
that I told you

1846
01:42:37,959 --> 01:42:40,260
about my mom and I selling
products door-to-door,

1847
01:42:40,394 --> 01:42:41,663
those were true.

1848
01:42:42,764 --> 01:42:43,931
They were all scams.

1849
01:42:44,899 --> 01:42:47,568
And we started out small,
and then they got bigger.

1850
01:42:47,702 --> 01:42:51,005
Like real estate and insurance.

1851
01:42:51,139 --> 01:42:52,372
And...

1852
01:42:53,941 --> 01:42:58,412
when I was 16, a guy in
North Dakota pulled a gun

1853
01:42:58,546 --> 01:43:01,415
and my mom pulled hers out
first and she killed him.

1854
01:43:01,549 --> 01:43:04,686
And she told me
to run and I did.

1855
01:43:04,819 --> 01:43:07,655
And she went to prison
and I never saw her again.

1856
01:43:11,559 --> 01:43:14,829
And I forged documents and
used fake names to get jobs.

1857
01:43:14,962 --> 01:43:18,833
And when I went to New
York, I found advertising.

1858
01:43:18,966 --> 01:43:23,805
And that was like the scams that
my mom taught me, but it was legal.

1859
01:43:27,108 --> 01:43:28,976
And I lied to so many people.

1860
01:43:29,877 --> 01:43:32,513
The worst lies were
the ones I told myself.

1861
01:43:32,647 --> 01:43:35,983
That everybody does it. You
know. It's just a big game.

1862
01:43:38,218 --> 01:43:39,954
But then I came down here...

1863
01:43:43,157 --> 01:43:44,491
I met you.

1864
01:43:49,831 --> 01:43:52,700
I learned what it was like to
be a part of something real.

1865
01:43:56,336 --> 01:43:58,505
Moe offered me a way
to erase my past.

1866
01:43:58,639 --> 01:44:00,675
I thought that's
what I wanted, but...

1867
01:44:04,112 --> 01:44:05,747
I don't wanna run anymore.

1868
01:44:13,621 --> 01:44:16,557
Moe is a worthy opponent,
but he has met his match.

1869
01:44:20,260 --> 01:44:23,131
I promise this is the last
time I will trick anyone

1870
01:44:23,296 --> 01:44:24,665
into getting what I want.

1871
01:44:26,033 --> 01:44:27,367
I promise.

1872
01:44:29,402 --> 01:44:31,539
Do you think you can
do it without lying?

1873
01:44:33,107 --> 01:44:35,543
- Absolutely not.
- Yeah, I didn't think so.

1874
01:44:41,015 --> 01:44:42,349
So, what's the plan?

1875
01:44:44,852 --> 01:44:46,187
[Don] <i>Why are we
meeting out here?</i>

1876
01:44:46,319 --> 01:44:47,822
Because Moe bugs everything.

1877
01:44:47,955 --> 01:44:49,624
The guy's like Houdini.
He's everywhere.

1878
01:44:49,757 --> 01:44:52,325
Okay, so, Moe doesn't know
that we fixed the LEM camera.

1879
01:44:52,459 --> 01:44:53,694
We build a plan around that.

1880
01:44:53,828 --> 01:44:55,563
All we have to do
is convince him

1881
01:44:55,696 --> 01:44:57,536
that we are broadcasting
the fake moon landing,

1882
01:44:57,598 --> 01:44:59,534
when in reality, we're
broadcasting the real one.

1883
01:44:59,667 --> 01:45:02,136
Is there a way that we
could rig the equipment

1884
01:45:02,270 --> 01:45:05,039
so that it actually sends
out the real LEM video feed?

1885
01:45:06,007 --> 01:45:07,007
[Cole] Come on, boys.

1886
01:45:07,074 --> 01:45:08,451
You figured out how
to land on the moon.

1887
01:45:08,475 --> 01:45:09,744
Give me a hypothetical.

1888
01:45:09,877 --> 01:45:13,014
Okay, um, hypothetically,
we could rewire it.

1889
01:45:13,147 --> 01:45:15,750
So that it only picks up the
broadcast signal from Mission Control.

1890
01:45:15,883 --> 01:45:18,052
- Sure, then sync it with our feed.
- [Stu] Hmm. Right.

1891
01:45:23,958 --> 01:45:25,259
Hey, fellas.

1892
01:45:25,392 --> 01:45:28,062
Moe Berkus sent these guys
to test the broadcast feed.

1893
01:45:28,196 --> 01:45:31,464
-Moe... Moe Berk... Yes.
-[coughing] Moe Berk... Moe Berkus.

1894
01:45:31,599 --> 01:45:33,768
[Ruby] Telling me none of
you got the phone call?

1895
01:45:34,702 --> 01:45:36,904
[smacks lips] Great. All
right, where's the camera?

1896
01:45:38,873 --> 01:45:40,942
[Don coughing]

1897
01:45:41,075 --> 01:45:42,176
- Are you okay?
- Mmm.

1898
01:45:42,977 --> 01:45:44,444
[Ruby] Can you guys
hurry up, please?

1899
01:45:44,579 --> 01:45:45,713
[Don coughs]

1900
01:45:45,847 --> 01:45:47,648
Don, maybe just take
the cigarette out.

1901
01:45:47,782 --> 01:45:50,785
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I've just
never smoked a cigarette before.

1902
01:45:51,719 --> 01:45:52,954
I don't like it.

1903
01:45:54,989 --> 01:45:56,991
[capsule communicator]
<i>uh, 11, this is Houston.</i>

1904
01:45:57,124 --> 01:45:58,491
<i>Uh, you are go for LOI. Over.</i>

1905
01:45:58,626 --> 01:46:00,103
[Buzz Aldrin] <i>Confirmed.
On track for the moon.</i>

1906
01:46:00,127 --> 01:46:02,087
[capsule communicator]
<i>Apollo 11, this is Houston.</i>

1907
01:46:02,163 --> 01:46:04,174
<i>All your systems are looking
good. Going around the corner.</i>

1908
01:46:04,198 --> 01:46:05,800
<i>We'll see you on the
other side. Over.</i>

1909
01:46:05,933 --> 01:46:07,711
[public affairs officer]
<i>And we've had loss of signal</i>

1910
01:46:07,735 --> 01:46:10,638
<i>as Apollo 11 goes
behind the moon.</i>

1911
01:46:10,771 --> 01:46:13,975
<i>It's now 3:30 Eastern
Daylight Time.</i>

1912
01:46:14,108 --> 01:46:18,112
<i>At 3:46 we should be getting the
first signal from the Lunar Module.</i>

1913
01:46:18,246 --> 01:46:20,815
<i>The estimated audience:
hundreds of millions.</i>

1914
01:46:20,948 --> 01:46:23,551
<i>Perhaps 400 million
persons or so are watching</i>

1915
01:46:23,684 --> 01:46:27,387
<i>this broadcast today of,
uh, the greatest event...</i>

1916
01:46:27,521 --> 01:46:28,789
Boys.

1917
01:46:30,124 --> 01:46:31,659
All right. Let's go.

1918
01:46:39,466 --> 01:46:42,536
A little bit more.
Well done, guys.

1919
01:46:46,240 --> 01:46:50,177
[Lance] Boys, when you hear
my voice, you hear God.

1920
01:46:50,311 --> 01:46:51,779
Now, this is a fake moon,

1921
01:46:51,913 --> 01:46:53,757
- but to the world, it's real.
- It's showtime, folks.

1922
01:46:53,781 --> 01:46:55,381
It needs to... Remember
where I left off.

1923
01:46:55,482 --> 01:46:58,953
Your government thanks you for
the work you're about to do.

1924
01:46:59,687 --> 01:47:01,589
Now, don't fuck it up.

1925
01:47:02,455 --> 01:47:04,859
What is this nasty
shit doing here?

1926
01:47:06,160 --> 01:47:07,895
- God.
- Excuse me.

1927
01:47:08,029 --> 01:47:10,298
This is a Tab set,
and that is my chair.

1928
01:47:10,463 --> 01:47:12,800
- Kelly, let's deal with this.
- Lance, thank you so much.

1929
01:47:12,934 --> 01:47:15,036
So, these screens...
This is our feed.

1930
01:47:15,169 --> 01:47:16,169
Yeah.

1931
01:47:16,237 --> 01:47:17,738
Okay. And then...

1932
01:47:17,872 --> 01:47:20,741
And the TV's a live
broadcast. Okay.

1933
01:47:22,176 --> 01:47:23,277
[Moe] Right.

1934
01:47:23,411 --> 01:47:24,845
Joseph, I'm sitting.

1935
01:47:24,979 --> 01:47:26,614
-[Moe] Oh, my God. Are you real?
-[sighs]

1936
01:47:26,747 --> 01:47:28,983
[Lance] I am the director,
Lance Vespertine.

1937
01:47:31,585 --> 01:47:33,421
[Moe] Stay out of
my way, will you?

1938
01:47:33,554 --> 01:47:36,199
[Lance] All right, I'd say it was nice
to meet you, but so far, it is not.

1939
01:47:36,223 --> 01:47:37,490
The pigeon's in the coop.

1940
01:47:37,625 --> 01:47:38,960
Copy that.

1941
01:47:41,762 --> 01:47:44,031
[Michael Collins] <i>Okay, you
should have him now, Houston.</i>

1942
01:47:44,165 --> 01:47:47,168
[capsule communicator] <i>Eagle, we've
got you now. It's looking good. Over.</i>

1943
01:47:49,904 --> 01:47:52,873
<i>We've got the Earth right
out of our front window.</i>

1944
01:47:53,007 --> 01:47:55,209
<i>Flight, we are go for landing.</i>

1945
01:47:55,343 --> 01:47:58,412
[flight director] <i>Roger. Understand.
Go for landing. 3,000 feet.</i>

1946
01:47:58,546 --> 01:48:01,515
[capsule communicator] <i>Eagle,
looking great. You're go.</i>

1947
01:48:13,627 --> 01:48:17,398
[Neil Armstrong] <i>Position checks
downrange show us to be a little long.</i>

1948
01:48:17,531 --> 01:48:19,743
[public affairs officer] <i>1,400
feet. Still looking very good.</i>

1949
01:48:19,767 --> 01:48:22,770
-[Neil Armstrong] <i>P30.</i>
-[capsule communicator] <i>Six plus two-five.</i>

1950
01:48:22,903 --> 01:48:24,438
[Buzz Aldrin] <i>Looks
like about 820.</i>

1951
01:48:24,572 --> 01:48:26,173
[capsule communicator]
<i>Throttle down.</i>

1952
01:48:28,542 --> 01:48:30,611
[Neil Armstrong]
<i>Flight, this is Eagle.</i>

1953
01:48:30,745 --> 01:48:33,881
<i>Sea of Tranquility is
rockier than expected.</i>

1954
01:48:34,015 --> 01:48:36,450
<i>We're gonna have to extend
another thousand feet.</i>

1955
01:48:36,584 --> 01:48:38,052
Hey, boys.

1956
01:48:39,820 --> 01:48:41,365
- Where does that put us?
- It'll give 'em

1957
01:48:41,389 --> 01:48:43,333
- 15 seconds of fuel left.
- They're gonna wanna abort.

1958
01:48:43,357 --> 01:48:45,693
[sighs] Neil can do this,
they just gotta let him.

1959
01:48:45,826 --> 01:48:47,728
[flight director]
<i>Stand by, Eagle.</i>

1960
01:48:47,862 --> 01:48:50,398
<i>We are calculating what that
will do to our fuel reserves.</i>

1961
01:48:50,564 --> 01:48:55,036
<i>ECOM puts that within 15
seconds. Prepare for abort.</i>

1962
01:48:56,303 --> 01:48:57,605
Flight... [sighs]

1963
01:48:57,738 --> 01:49:00,307
we have run successful
tests within that range.

1964
01:49:00,441 --> 01:49:01,742
Let 'em land.

1965
01:49:03,444 --> 01:49:05,244
[capsule communicator]
<i>Thirty. Thirty seconds.</i>

1966
01:49:05,346 --> 01:49:06,747
- That's a lie.
- You lied.

1967
01:49:06,881 --> 01:49:08,749
I've learned some
new tricks. Sit down.

1968
01:49:08,883 --> 01:49:11,986
[capsule communicator] <i>Okay, the only
callouts from now on will be fuel.</i>

1969
01:49:13,387 --> 01:49:14,688
Come on.

1970
01:49:14,822 --> 01:49:16,724
<i>Eagle, looking
great. You're go.</i>

feet, down at four.</i>

1973
01:49:24,398 --> 01:49:26,667
[capsule communicator]
<i>Thirty. Thirty seconds.</i>

1974
01:49:26,801 --> 01:49:28,445
[Buzz Aldrin] <i>Down two
and a half. Forward.</i>

1975
01:49:28,469 --> 01:49:30,971
- <i>Forward. Good.</i>
-[capsule communicator] <i>Roger that.</i>

1976
01:49:32,541 --> 01:49:34,475
[Buzz Aldrin] <i>Eleven
forward. Coming down nicely.</i>

1977
01:49:34,608 --> 01:49:36,310
<i>200 feet, four and a half down.</i>

1978
01:49:36,444 --> 01:49:38,846
<i>Five and a half down. Five
and a half down, nine forward.</i>

1979
01:49:38,979 --> 01:49:40,214
<i>That's good.</i>

1980
01:49:53,694 --> 01:49:54,995
<i>Contact light.</i>

1981
01:49:58,833 --> 01:50:00,301
<i>Engine stop.</i>

1982
01:50:12,581 --> 01:50:13,914
<i>Flight.</i>

1983
01:50:15,449 --> 01:50:17,451
<i>Tranquility Base here.</i>

1984
01:50:17,586 --> 01:50:19,220
<i>The Eagle has landed.</i>

1985
01:50:25,560 --> 01:50:28,295
[capsule communicator] <i>Roger,
Tranquility, we copy on the ground.</i>

1986
01:50:28,429 --> 01:50:30,431
<i>You got a bunch of guys
about to turn blue.</i>

1987
01:50:30,565 --> 01:50:32,366
<i>We're breathing
again. Thanks a lot.</i>

1988
01:50:38,973 --> 01:50:40,609
<i>Whew. Boy.</i> [chuckles]

1989
01:50:40,741 --> 01:50:42,781
[Neil Armstrong] <i>We're going
to be busy for a minute.</i>

1990
01:50:45,746 --> 01:50:47,882
All right, all right,
all right. Come on.

1991
01:50:48,015 --> 01:50:51,218
Let's focus. We're
only halfway there.

1992
01:50:52,253 --> 01:50:54,121
Yeah, we've got it from
here. Thank you, guys.

1993
01:50:54,255 --> 01:50:57,391
Places. Places,
everyone. Look sharp.

1994
01:50:57,526 --> 01:50:58,859
[Lance] Let's look sharp!

1995
01:50:58,993 --> 01:51:00,737
Edvard, Edvard, off the
stage. You're killing me.

1996
01:51:00,761 --> 01:51:04,599
Edvard, we are done. Uh-uh.
You're done. No more tweaking.

1997
01:51:04,732 --> 01:51:07,034
- What are you, the repeater?
- No, I'm not the repeater.

1998
01:51:07,168 --> 01:51:09,436
This is the system we
created before you got here.

1999
01:51:16,343 --> 01:51:18,212
[Neil Armstrong]
<i>Camera is coming down.</i>

2000
01:51:24,752 --> 01:51:29,790
Three, two, one, and action.

2001
01:51:31,992 --> 01:51:35,062
[capsule communicator] <i>And we're
getting a picture on the TV.</i>

2002
01:51:35,196 --> 01:51:37,398
[Buzz Aldrin] <i>You got
a good picture, huh?</i>

2003
01:51:37,532 --> 01:51:40,301
[capsule communicator] <i>Uh, there's
a great deal of contrast in it.</i>

2004
01:51:40,434 --> 01:51:42,903
[Buzz Aldrin] Roger, <i>TV
circuit breaker's in,</i>

2005
01:51:43,871 --> 01:51:45,839
<i>and read you loud and clear.</i>

2006
01:51:47,007 --> 01:51:48,409
[capsule communicator] <i>Roger.</i>

2007
01:51:53,380 --> 01:51:56,050
[Buzz Aldrin] <i>Okay. Will
you verify the position, uh,</i>

2008
01:51:56,183 --> 01:51:58,085
<i>the, uh, opening I ought
to have on the camera?</i>

2009
01:51:58,219 --> 01:51:59,521
[capsule communicator]
<i>Stand by.</i>

2010
01:51:59,654 --> 01:52:02,489
Armstrong, prepare to disembark.

2011
01:52:03,757 --> 01:52:05,192
<i>Your visor.</i>

2012
01:52:08,697 --> 01:52:11,131
[Neil Armstrong] <i>I am
opening the door for egress.</i>

2013
01:52:25,012 --> 01:52:27,047
[indistinct radio chatter]

2014
01:52:30,784 --> 01:52:33,954
[capsule communicator] <i>Okay, Neil, we
can see you coming down the ladder now.</i>

2015
01:52:35,724 --> 01:52:37,858
Okay, left.

2016
01:52:39,426 --> 01:52:41,262
And right.

2017
01:52:43,531 --> 01:52:45,966
Left and right.

2018
01:52:46,100 --> 01:52:48,703
Now, left foot
off. Left foot off.

2019
01:52:48,836 --> 01:52:52,273
Easy. Easy. Step down.

2020
01:52:52,873 --> 01:52:55,342
And land.

2021
01:52:55,476 --> 01:52:57,911
How do you know what, uh,
he's gonna do ahead of time?

2022
01:52:58,045 --> 01:53:01,982
NASA rehearsed all of this,
and Kelly appropriated it.

2023
01:53:02,651 --> 01:53:03,817
Oh, stole it.

2024
01:53:03,951 --> 01:53:06,387
I knew I hired the right people.

2025
01:53:07,656 --> 01:53:09,223
[Lance] Okay, here we go.

2026
01:53:12,359 --> 01:53:14,596
It's seamless.
It's incredible.

2027
01:53:15,530 --> 01:53:17,699
[Neil Armstrong] <i>I'm at
the foot of the ladder.</i>

2028
01:53:17,865 --> 01:53:20,602
<i>The LEM footpads are only
depressed in the surface</i>

2029
01:53:20,735 --> 01:53:22,436
<i>about one or two inches,</i>

2030
01:53:22,570 --> 01:53:25,005
<i>although the surface
appears to be very,</i>

2031
01:53:25,139 --> 01:53:27,941
<i>very fine-grained as
you get close to it.</i>

2032
01:53:28,075 --> 01:53:33,080
<i>It's almost like a powder.
Down there, it's very fine.</i>

2033
01:53:34,114 --> 01:53:36,150
<i>I'm gonna step off the LEM now.</i>

2034
01:53:41,889 --> 01:53:44,592
<i>That's one small step for man...</i>

2035
01:53:47,961 --> 01:53:51,533
<i>one giant leap for mankind.</i>

2036
01:53:56,638 --> 01:53:59,340
We could have spent years coming
up with something that good.

2037
01:54:00,474 --> 01:54:02,309
- Yeah.
- [chuckles]

2038
01:54:02,443 --> 01:54:05,312
- [chuckles]
- Was that, uh, in the script?

2039
01:54:05,446 --> 01:54:06,980
No.

2040
01:54:08,015 --> 01:54:09,383
That's a good line.

2041
01:54:14,154 --> 01:54:15,599
[Buzz Aldrin] <i>It's
a very simple matter</i>

2042
01:54:15,623 --> 01:54:17,759

step to the next.</i>

01:54:17,891 --> 01:54:20,294

2048
01:54:35,810 --> 01:54:38,770
[capsule communicator] <i>Uh, Neil, this
is Houston. The field of view is okay.</i>

2049
01:54:38,847 --> 01:54:41,850
<i>We'd like you to aim it a little
bit more to the right. Over.</i>

2050
01:54:41,982 --> 01:54:43,518
[Neil Armstrong] <i>Okay.</i>

2051
01:54:43,651 --> 01:54:45,553
[capsule communicator]
<i>Too much to the right.</i>

2052
01:54:45,687 --> 01:54:48,322
<i>Can you bring it back left
about, uh, four or five degrees?</i>

2053
01:54:53,227 --> 01:54:55,195
<i>Okay. That looks good, Neil.</i>

2054
01:54:56,463 --> 01:54:58,833

2058
01:55:05,607 --> 01:55:08,308
<i>Could we get both of you on the
camera for a minute, please?</i>

2059
01:55:08,442 --> 01:55:10,512
<i>The President of
the United States</i>

2060
01:55:10,645 --> 01:55:12,881

2061

<i>Hello, Neil and Buzz.</i>

2065
01:55:20,954 --> 01:55:23,023
<i>I am talking to you by telephone</i>

<i>from the Oval Room

They have Secret Service
all over this place.

2068
01:55:27,394 --> 01:55:31,965
<i>And this certainly has to be the most
historic telephone call ever made.</i>

2069
01:55:33,000 --> 01:55:34,435
<i>And as you talk to us...</i>

2070
01:55:34,569 --> 01:55:37,037
He actually reminds
me a lot of you.

2071
01:55:37,171 --> 01:55:39,973
Do not say that. No, don't
even joke about that.

2072
01:55:40,107 --> 01:55:44,579
We're still holding while the
president drones on. Don't move.

2073
01:55:44,712 --> 01:55:46,614

watching you the most.

me. Do you see picture?</i>

Um, one second, Neil.

2084
01:56:14,909 --> 01:56:16,921
Neil's saying the video feed
light isn't on up there.

2085
01:56:16,945 --> 01:56:18,188
Are you sure that
camera's working?

2086
01:56:18,212 --> 01:56:19,279
I installed the new part.

2087
01:56:19,413 --> 01:56:20,591

just fine but...

01:56:20,615 --> 01:56:23,083
- But what?
- But I... I was in a rush.
