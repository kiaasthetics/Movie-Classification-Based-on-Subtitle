00:01:34,442 --> 00:01:37,139
<i>Drain Lords, hundreds of them,</i>

4
00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:38,923
<i>coming out of the drains!</i>

5
00:01:38,924 --> 00:01:41,578
<i>Isabel's bathroom has a new
supernatural infestation</i>

6
00:01:41,579 --> 00:01:44,277
<i>that no exterminator
can take care of.</i>

7
00:01:44,278 --> 00:01:46,279
<i>It's "The Attack of
the Drain Lords."</i>

8
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:47,758
<i>10:30p.m./ 9:30 Central,</i>

9
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:49,718
<i>this Saturday night on
the Young Adult Network.</i>

10
00:01:50,806 --> 00:01:52,241
<i>They can't hurt you</i>

11
00:01:52,242 --> 00:01:54,635

12
00:01:54,636 --> 00:01:57,508
<i>They can't hurt you if you

13
00:02:24,405 --> 00:02:27,015
Five, four,

00:02:27,016 --> 00:02:29,931
three, two,

15
00:02:29,932 --> 00:02:30,932
one!

16
00:03:27,207 --> 00:03:30,513
<i>It was raining last night
and I couldn't sleep,</i>

17
00:03:30,514 --> 00:03:32,777
<i>so I started my
favorite TV show again.</i>

18
00:03:34,083 --> 00:03:35,998
The Pink Opaque.

19
00:04:44,893 --> 00:04:46,894
Thank you, ma'am. Yes.

20
00:04:46,895 --> 00:04:49,071
Enjoy your night. Yeah.

21
00:04:52,988 --> 00:04:54,206
Hey.

22
00:04:55,599 --> 00:04:57,993
Oh, let me take two,
yeah. Thank you.

23
00:05:08,873 --> 00:05:12,702
Owen! Owen, honey.

24
00:05:12,703 --> 00:05:14,879
Come on, honey,
we're ready to go in.

25
00:05:17,055 --> 00:05:18,100
Come on.

26
00:05:23,192 --> 00:05:24,759
I don't know what he's doing...

27
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:29,938
Ready?

28
00:05:31,374 --> 00:05:35,029
Owen, I know you're
not too old for this.

29
00:05:35,030 --> 00:05:36,857
It's been four years.

30
00:05:36,858 --> 00:05:39,120
It's time to vote for
the saxophone man again.

31
00:05:39,121 --> 00:05:40,383
Mom!

32
00:05:44,474 --> 00:05:46,911
Okay. Come on.

33
00:05:47,564 --> 00:05:51,088
Come on. Come... Owen, come on.

34
00:05:51,089 --> 00:05:52,395
Please.

35
00:06:06,757 --> 00:06:08,672
I don't know. I
don't think so.

36
00:06:57,721 --> 00:06:59,201
Hey.

37
00:07:01,595 --> 00:07:03,031
Hey.

38
00:07:06,338 --> 00:07:08,340
Are your parents voting too?

39
00:07:09,733 --> 00:07:11,213
No.

40
00:07:12,127 --> 00:07:14,781
Ms. Driscoll lets me use
the dark room after school,

41
00:07:14,782 --> 00:07:17,219
so I'm just waiting for
my pictures to dry out.

42
00:07:23,573 --> 00:07:25,836
That looks like
the best book ever.

43
00:07:26,707 --> 00:07:28,230
Yeah, it is.

44
00:07:29,753 --> 00:07:32,712
That's like the TV show, right?

45
00:07:32,713 --> 00:07:34,149
<i>The Pink Opaque?</i>

46
00:07:35,803 --> 00:07:38,501
Yeah. It's the
official episode guide.

47
00:07:39,154 --> 00:07:40,372
Do you watch?

48
00:07:43,375 --> 00:07:45,856
- No.
- Oh.

49
00:08:16,321 --> 00:08:18,019
What grade are you in?

50
00:08:18,846 --> 00:08:20,108
Ninth.

51
00:08:24,895 --> 00:08:26,418
What about you?

52
00:08:28,246 --> 00:08:29,290
Seventh.

53
00:08:29,291 --> 00:08:32,337
My God, you're a baby.

54
00:08:42,826 --> 00:08:44,828
Election Night is cool, right?

55
00:08:46,961 --> 00:08:49,398
It's like Colonial Day.

56
00:08:51,139 --> 00:08:53,314
Or when they bring the
inflatable planetarium

57
00:08:53,315 --> 00:08:54,403
into the gymnasium.

58
00:08:56,971 --> 00:08:58,624
It's like the school
gets transformed

59
00:08:58,625 --> 00:09:00,235
into something else, you know?

60
00:09:04,065 --> 00:09:05,457
It's special.

61
00:09:08,548 --> 00:09:09,984
It's a kids show, right?

62
00:09:11,376 --> 00:09:12,681
<i>The Pink Opaque?</i>

63
00:09:12,682 --> 00:09:16,860
No. No way. Who told you that?

64
00:09:18,601 --> 00:09:20,882
I mean, yeah, technically it's
on the Young Adult Network.

65
00:09:21,299 --> 00:09:22,778
But it's way too scary,

66
00:09:22,779 --> 00:09:25,955
and the mythology's way too
complicated for most kids.

67
00:09:25,956 --> 00:09:27,957
I see commercials
for it all the time.

68
00:09:27,958 --> 00:09:29,394
It looks amazing.

69
00:09:37,968 --> 00:09:40,318
You can read about the
episodes here, if you want.

70
00:09:43,495 --> 00:09:46,410
It's got quotes and pictures,

71
00:09:46,411 --> 00:09:48,238
and info about the
double bill of bands

72
00:09:48,239 --> 00:09:50,633
that plays each week
at the Double Lunch.

73
00:09:57,988 --> 00:10:00,642
It comes on at
10:30 p.m., right?

74
00:10:00,643 --> 00:10:03,602
Yeah. Every Saturday night.

75
00:10:03,603 --> 00:10:04,864
It's the last show in the block

76
00:10:04,865 --> 00:10:06,430
before they switch to
black and white reruns

77
00:10:06,431 --> 00:10:08,171
for old people.

78
00:10:08,172 --> 00:10:10,958
My friend Amanda and I watch
it together every week.

79
00:10:14,352 --> 00:10:16,920
My dad won't let me
stay up that late.

80
00:10:19,009 --> 00:10:21,011
10 p.m.'s my bedtime.

81
00:10:21,533 --> 00:10:22,622
Damn.

82
00:10:23,666 --> 00:10:25,276
That absolutely sucks.

83
00:10:27,104 --> 00:10:29,541
My mom basically doesn't
give a crap when I go to bed.

84
00:10:34,285 --> 00:10:35,504
Hey.

85
00:10:36,766 --> 00:10:38,507
You know what you should do?

86
00:10:43,773 --> 00:10:45,645
Mom? Hmm?

87
00:10:50,519 --> 00:10:51,693
Can I have a sleepover

88
00:10:51,694 --> 00:10:53,957
at Johnny Link's
house Saturday night?

89
00:10:59,006 --> 00:11:00,616
Johnny Link?

90
00:11:03,053 --> 00:11:06,491
I didn't even know you guys
were still friends anymore.

91
00:11:12,889 --> 00:11:15,370
Well, honey, you'll
have to ask your father.

92
00:11:26,598 --> 00:11:28,644
Can you ask him for me?

93
00:12:03,766 --> 00:12:05,201
Frank, Owen wants to go

94
00:12:05,202 --> 00:12:07,727
have a sleepover
at Johnny Link's.

95
00:12:09,903 --> 00:12:12,383
Well... He's old enough.

96
00:12:14,777 --> 00:12:16,344
He's a good kid.

97
00:12:45,503 --> 00:12:46,895
Honey!

98
00:12:46,896 --> 00:12:49,333
You remembered your
inhaler, right?

99
00:12:52,293 --> 00:12:54,034
Yeah.

100
00:12:55,339 --> 00:12:56,732
All right.

101
00:14:02,015 --> 00:14:05,452
And what about a husband?

102
00:14:05,453 --> 00:14:07,672
If I have to.

103
00:14:08,369 --> 00:14:10,153
What about Evan Dando?

104
00:14:11,067 --> 00:14:13,286
I mean, he's cute
but he's so tortured.

105
00:14:13,287 --> 00:14:16,071
I'd have to, like,
save him every day.

106
00:14:16,072 --> 00:14:18,421
Fine. Then what about Beck?

107
00:14:18,422 --> 00:14:21,295
He's such a spindly
little cutie.

108
00:14:26,343 --> 00:14:29,084
Okay, but we need
more, like, gross guys.

109
00:14:29,085 --> 00:14:30,999
Ugh, what about Joe from Math?

110
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,087
No, he's cute.

111
00:14:32,088 --> 00:14:33,873
What about, like, Michael Stipe?

112
00:14:34,395 --> 00:14:36,091
I like Michael Stipe.

113
00:14:36,092 --> 00:14:37,919
[ON TV] <i>And now, a
brand-new</i> The Pink Opaque.

Hey.

115
00:14:40,444 --> 00:14:42,315
Is it okay if I come sit down?

116
00:14:42,316 --> 00:14:44,318
Shut up. It's starting.

Definition of.

128
00:15:42,071 --> 00:15:43,855
It's not fair, man.

129
00:15:44,552 --> 00:15:46,422
Why does the winter
have to be so cold

130
00:15:46,423 --> 00:15:49,296
that you can't eat ice
cream during the winter?

131

You know what I wish?

132
00:15:56,085 --> 00:15:59,566
I wish the Ice Cream

<i>he never went away.</i>

136

You can go out and
join her, if you want.

137
00:16:49,399 --> 00:16:51,793
No, I don't smoke cigarettes.

138
00:16:52,750 --> 00:16:55,405
It's not a cigarette.

139
00:16:57,320 --> 00:16:58,669
It's a Black & Mild.

140
00:17:06,764 --> 00:17:08,548
Are you sure you
don't want a ride home

141
00:17:08,549 --> 00:17:10,420
with Amanda's mom?

142
00:17:14,207 --> 00:17:16,644
I told my parents
it was a sleepover.

143
00:17:38,361 --> 00:17:39,928
So, did you like it?

144
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:42,496
The show I mean?

145
00:17:44,585 --> 00:17:46,542
Yeah.

146
00:17:46,543 --> 00:17:49,807
It was... It was
really interesting.

147
00:17:51,374 --> 00:17:53,767
Isabel's a scaredy-cat.

148
00:17:53,768 --> 00:17:55,116
She's kind of the
main character,

149
00:17:55,117 --> 00:17:57,076
but she's also kind of a drip.

150
00:17:58,120 --> 00:18:00,774
Tara's my favorite.
She's super hot,

151
00:18:00,775 --> 00:18:03,777
and she doesn't take
shit from anybody.

152
00:18:03,778 --> 00:18:06,041
Plus, she's an
expert on demonology.

153
00:18:07,912 --> 00:18:11,524
And they never meet
up in person, right?

154
00:18:11,525 --> 00:18:12,700
No.

155
00:18:13,788 --> 00:18:17,530
Just in the pilot episode,
back at sleepaway camp.

156
00:18:17,531 --> 00:18:20,272
But they can communicate
via "the psychic plane."

157
00:18:20,273 --> 00:18:22,926
So, each episode, they help
each other fight a new monster

158
00:18:22,927 --> 00:18:24,015
from across the county.

159
00:18:25,060 --> 00:18:26,366
Okay.

160
00:18:28,585 --> 00:18:30,892
Is the Ice Cream Man
in every episode?

161
00:18:31,414 --> 00:18:33,634
No.

162
00:18:34,548 --> 00:18:36,202
That's just a
Monster of the Week.

163
00:18:37,594 --> 00:18:39,857
Mr. Melancholy is the Big Bad.

164
00:18:42,121 --> 00:18:43,731
Mr. Melancholy?

165
00:18:44,471 --> 00:18:46,037
The Man in the Moon.

166
00:18:46,647 --> 00:18:48,909
Oh, right.

167
00:18:48,910 --> 00:18:51,173
He's always messing
with time and reality.

168
00:18:51,869 --> 00:18:53,435
He wants to rule the world,

169
00:18:53,436 --> 00:18:56,047
to trap Isabel and Tara
in the Midnight Realm.

170
00:18:56,787 --> 00:18:58,048
So each week,

171
00:18:58,049 --> 00:18:59,689
he sends a new
supernatural foe their way.

172
00:19:00,748 --> 00:19:03,184
Because they're part
of The Pink Opaque.

173
00:19:03,185 --> 00:19:06,623
No, because they
are The Pink Opaque.

174
00:19:08,321 --> 00:19:09,583
Right.

175
00:19:10,149 --> 00:19:11,193
Sorry.

176
00:19:15,719 --> 00:19:17,156
Don't apologize.

177
00:19:25,164 --> 00:19:26,903
Well, I'm passing out.

178
00:19:26,904 --> 00:19:29,210
Are you sure it's okay
that I sleep down here?

179
00:19:29,211 --> 00:19:31,473
Just be out by dawn.

180
00:19:31,474 --> 00:19:34,173
If my stepdad catches you,
he'll break my nose again.

181
00:19:35,522 --> 00:19:37,654
And where... where
will you be sleeping?

182
00:19:38,307 --> 00:19:41,005
In my bed... creep.

183
00:20:13,560 --> 00:20:14,822
Sometimes...

184
00:20:16,693 --> 00:20:20,219
<i>The Pink Opaque</i> feels
more real than real life.

185
00:20:25,920 --> 00:20:27,269
You know?

186
00:22:41,011 --> 00:22:42,751
<i>So,</i>

187
00:22:42,752 --> 00:22:45,842
<i>how you feeling about my
little health scare, buddy?</i>

188
00:22:47,409 --> 00:22:48,889
I'm fine.

189
00:22:55,809 --> 00:22:57,158
It just...

190
00:22:57,898 --> 00:23:00,814
seems like you're always
somewhere else lately.

191
00:23:02,511 --> 00:23:04,643
I don't know...

192
00:23:04,644 --> 00:23:07,081
I'm not sure if it's
'cause of me, or...

193
00:23:10,214 --> 00:23:11,433
I don't know. I...

194
00:23:14,349 --> 00:23:16,264
Maybe I'm just making it up.

195
00:23:21,530 --> 00:23:22,661
Just want to know that

196
00:23:22,662 --> 00:23:25,360
you're on the right
path, you know?

197
00:23:39,374 --> 00:23:42,159
Can I stay up late to watch
<i>The Pink Opaque</i> tonight?

198
00:23:43,857 --> 00:23:46,076
What time does it come on?

199
00:23:51,691 --> 00:23:53,301
10:30 p.m.

200
00:23:58,828 --> 00:24:01,440
You know your
bedtime is at 10:15.

201
00:24:04,486 --> 00:24:06,488
Yeah, but...

202
00:24:09,012 --> 00:24:13,756
no one in the ninth grade
even has a bedtime anymore.

203
00:24:24,680 --> 00:24:27,378
Isn't that a show for girls?

204
00:24:39,521 --> 00:24:41,828
Not tonight, honey.

205
00:24:50,445 --> 00:24:53,229
After that first sleepover, I
couldn't work up the courage

206
00:24:53,230 --> 00:24:57,625
to say more than three words
to Maddy Wilson at a time.

207
00:24:57,626 --> 00:24:59,497
But when I told her I
still wasn't allowed

208
00:24:59,498 --> 00:25:01,107
to watch the show,

209
00:25:01,108 --> 00:25:03,284
she started leaving
tapes for me.

210
00:27:33,956 --> 00:27:37,177
I watched these tapes
over and over again.

211
00:27:37,830 --> 00:27:39,788
But they never got old.

212
00:28:05,379 --> 00:28:08,687
<i>His henchmen are close by.</i>

213
00:28:10,645 --> 00:28:12,691
Marco and Polo.

214
00:28:13,213 --> 00:28:15,084
Nasty little demons.

215
00:28:17,130 --> 00:28:20,002
And he... he's...

216
00:28:23,702 --> 00:28:25,268
Mr. Melancholy.

217
00:28:28,489 --> 00:28:29,620
That's right.

218
00:28:32,188 --> 00:28:34,756
What's happening to me?

219
00:28:35,844 --> 00:28:39,412
How do I know these things?

220
00:28:39,413 --> 00:28:43,721
Am I going crazy?

221
00:28:43,722 --> 00:28:47,769
No. Never let anyone
convince you of that.

222
00:28:48,465 --> 00:28:49,771
<i>You're like me.</i>

223
00:28:51,860 --> 00:28:53,296
<i>You're special.</i>

224
00:28:54,863 --> 00:28:57,039
We are The Pink Opaque.

225
00:28:58,475 --> 00:28:59,781
It's our destiny.

226
00:29:01,304 --> 00:29:02,565
I knew it from the moment

227
00:29:02,566 --> 00:29:04,438
I saw your tattoo
in the dining hall.

228
00:29:05,439 --> 00:29:07,702
Heck, I knew it
before I even met you.

229
00:29:08,921 --> 00:29:10,096
Can you feel it?

230
00:29:17,973 --> 00:29:20,628
I don't even have my
learner's permit yet.

231
00:29:22,456 --> 00:29:24,763
<i>- How can I have a destiny?</i>
- How can I have a destiny?

232
00:30:29,392 --> 00:30:30,611
Hey.

233
00:30:36,095 --> 00:30:37,531
What's up?

234
00:30:38,575 --> 00:30:40,142
Nothing much.

235
00:30:47,889 --> 00:30:50,892
Um, I was wondering...

236
00:30:54,113 --> 00:30:55,810
Do you, um...

237
00:30:57,029 --> 00:30:59,552
Do you and Amanda

238
00:30:59,553 --> 00:31:01,815
still watch <i>The Pink
Opaque</i> together every week?

239
00:31:01,816 --> 00:31:04,513
I haven't talked to
that asshole in a year.

240
00:31:04,514 --> 00:31:07,168
Amanda told the entire school
that I tried to touch her tit,

241
00:31:07,169 --> 00:31:08,822
which is a total lie!

242
00:31:08,823 --> 00:31:10,737
And then surprise, surprise,
11th grade comes around

243
00:31:10,738 --> 00:31:12,260
and suddenly it's been
her lifelong dream

244
00:31:12,261 --> 00:31:14,873
to join the cheer squad! Ugh!

245
00:31:17,353 --> 00:31:20,313
Secret agent sent here to make
my life miserable, I swear.

246
00:31:27,059 --> 00:31:29,888
If you wanted, I
could come over again.

247
00:31:32,586 --> 00:31:35,109
I've been watching the
tapes you've been making me

248
00:31:35,110 --> 00:31:36,676
but I wanted to
watch <i>The Pink Opaque</i>

249
00:31:36,677 --> 00:31:38,678
on Saturday night again.

250
00:31:38,679 --> 00:31:40,637
While it airs.

251
00:31:47,035 --> 00:31:49,385
I like girls. You
know that, right?

252
00:31:50,038 --> 00:31:52,344
I'm not into boys.

253
00:31:52,345 --> 00:31:57,132
I wasn't... I...
Totally. That's fine.

254
00:31:58,394 --> 00:32:00,440
Okay. I'm just making sure.

255
00:32:08,143 --> 00:32:09,840
What about you?
Do you like girls?

256
00:32:12,278 --> 00:32:16,325
I don't... I don't know.

257
00:32:17,544 --> 00:32:18,762
Boys?

258
00:32:20,373 --> 00:32:26,248
I... I think that
I like TV shows.

259
00:32:42,134 --> 00:32:45,832
When I think about that stuff,

260
00:32:45,833 --> 00:32:47,530
it feels like someone...

261
00:32:49,750 --> 00:32:53,362
took a shovel and dug
out all my insides.

262
00:32:55,277 --> 00:33:00,456
And I know there's
nothing in there,

263
00:33:01,327 --> 00:33:04,590
but I'm still too nervous

264
00:33:04,591 --> 00:33:08,812
to open myself up and check.

265
00:33:13,643 --> 00:33:15,732
I know there's
something wrong with me.

266
00:33:16,516 --> 00:33:17,646
My parents know it too,

267
00:33:17,647 --> 00:33:19,388
even if they don't say anything.

268
00:33:26,874 --> 00:33:29,007
Do you ever feel like that?

269
00:33:38,320 --> 00:33:39,756
I don't know.

270
00:33:48,200 --> 00:33:50,028
Maybe you're like Isabel...

271
00:33:54,119 --> 00:33:55,903
Afraid of what's inside you.

272
00:34:16,880 --> 00:34:20,274
Hey, Bozo! Estee
Lauder called.

273
00:34:20,275 --> 00:34:21,667
They've got a few suggestions

274
00:34:21,668 --> 00:34:24,149
about this whole look
you're going for.

275
00:35:30,389 --> 00:35:32,173
I'm getting out of this town.

276
00:35:38,440 --> 00:35:40,007
Did you know that?

277
00:35:43,271 --> 00:35:44,620
Soon.

278
00:35:56,676 --> 00:35:58,286
I'll die if I stay here.

279
00:36:02,812 --> 00:36:05,685
I don't know how exactly,
but I know it's true.

280
00:36:19,394 --> 00:36:21,003
If you leave,

281
00:36:21,004 --> 00:36:23,224
I won't have anyone to
watch <i>The Pink Opaque</i> with.

282
00:36:48,641 --> 00:36:50,077
Sit up.

283
00:39:19,531 --> 00:39:20,922
Pack as much as you can

284
00:39:20,923 --> 00:39:22,969
in your overnight
bag next Saturday.

285
00:39:27,713 --> 00:39:29,932
You can't tell
anyone we're leaving.

286
00:39:32,587 --> 00:39:34,067
Not your mom.

287
00:39:36,548 --> 00:39:38,027
Not anyone.

288
00:39:45,644 --> 00:39:47,080
Where will we go?

289
00:39:51,606 --> 00:39:53,391
We'll know when we get there.

290
00:40:10,625 --> 00:40:13,061
Owen? Uh, Johnny's
not home, but...

291
00:40:13,062 --> 00:40:18,719
You have to tell my dad
that I've been lying to him.

292
00:40:18,720 --> 00:40:21,461
I've been pretending
to sleep here

293
00:40:21,462 --> 00:40:23,071
while my mom's in the hospital.

294
00:40:23,072 --> 00:40:25,727
And I need to be grounded.

295
00:40:27,425 --> 00:40:29,295
Okay. Slow down, honey. What?

296
00:40:29,296 --> 00:40:31,950
You can't let me go with her.

297
00:40:31,951 --> 00:40:34,780
I don't want to leave my home.

298
00:40:47,096 --> 00:40:50,056
<i>My mom passed away
the next July.</i>

299
00:40:51,753 --> 00:40:54,276
<i>And a few weeks later,</i>

300
00:40:54,277 --> 00:40:57,193
<i>Maddy disappeared
without a trace.</i>

301
00:41:06,464 --> 00:41:10,946
All they found was her TV
set burning in the backyard.

302
00:41:19,999 --> 00:41:23,088
<i>And the strangest
part of it all was,</i>

303
00:41:23,089 --> 00:41:26,526
<i>that exact same month
that Maddy disappeared,</i>

304
00:41:26,527 --> 00:41:30,226
The Pink Opaque <i>got canceled.</i>

305
00:42:44,300 --> 00:42:47,172
[OVER SPEAKER] <i>Welcome
to Burger Express.</i>

306
00:42:47,173 --> 00:42:48,434
Hello?

307
00:42:48,435 --> 00:42:49,567
<i>Hi.</i>

308
00:42:51,569 --> 00:42:54,484
- Are you ready to take my...

00:42:56,748 --> 00:42:58,749
- Yeah, sorry. Can I get...
<i>- Are you there?</i>

310
00:42:58,750 --> 00:43:01,186
I just want... Can I get
two double cheeseburgers

311
00:43:01,187 --> 00:43:03,231
and a small fries
and a root beer?

312
00:43:03,232 --> 00:43:07,367
<i>- $11.09. Drive around.</i>
- Okay. Okay, thank you.

313
00:43:18,421 --> 00:43:19,944
Answering his phone,

314
00:43:19,945 --> 00:43:21,859
so I can't start...

315
00:43:21,860 --> 00:43:25,689
the projector until
I get the key.

316
00:43:25,690 --> 00:43:28,517
Um, so if you could call me back

317
00:43:28,518 --> 00:43:31,434
and just let me know...

318
00:43:32,914 --> 00:43:35,569
What the hell!

319
00:43:39,617 --> 00:43:41,401
Sorry! Sorry!

320
00:44:02,378 --> 00:44:04,989
Uh, hey, Owen, um,

321
00:44:04,990 --> 00:44:07,296
did you like what
you saw earlier?

322
00:44:08,384 --> 00:44:10,822
Me and Erica?

323
00:44:14,086 --> 00:44:15,477
You know, because, if you want,

324
00:44:15,478 --> 00:44:18,177
I can put in a good
word with Erica for you.

325
00:44:19,265 --> 00:44:21,092
She's, like, obsessed
with you, man.

326
00:44:21,093 --> 00:44:22,354
She's like, "Oh,
I love that guy."

327
00:44:22,355 --> 00:44:24,138
"He's so cool! Oh, my God!"

328
00:44:24,139 --> 00:44:26,358
It's "on" for you, brother.

329
00:44:26,359 --> 00:44:28,099
Come on, man.

330
00:44:28,100 --> 00:44:32,494
Hey, why don't you
look at me. Please.

331
00:44:32,495 --> 00:44:35,629
Just make eye contact
with me. Seriously.

332
00:44:46,684 --> 00:44:48,294
What the heck?

333
00:45:14,189 --> 00:45:15,408
Hello?

334
00:45:17,149 --> 00:45:18,541
Is somebody there?

"Escape from the
Midnight Realm."

337
00:46:18,645 --> 00:46:21,909
I'm sorry that I'm late.
There was a downed power line.

<i>Within hours,</i>

Do you need help?

347
00:48:23,378 --> 00:48:24,902

I know a place on

They think you're dead, Maddy.

379
00:51:27,997 --> 00:51:29,042
I don't know.

380
00:51:30,304 --> 00:51:31,523
Sometime.

381
00:51:34,003 --> 00:51:37,094
And you won't tell me where
you've been this past decade?

382
00:51:39,096 --> 00:51:40,706
I'll tell you everything.

383
00:51:42,055 --> 00:51:43,143
I just...

384
00:51:46,103 --> 00:51:47,755
I need to ask you
something first.

385
00:51:47,756 --> 00:51:49,976
Does your mom know
that you're alive?

386
00:51:53,153 --> 00:51:55,503
I need to ask you
something first.

387
00:51:58,941 --> 00:52:01,118
Okay. Okay.

388
00:52:02,380 --> 00:52:04,295

391

Do you remember a TV show
we used to watch together?

392
00:52:26,273 --> 00:52:28,057
It was called...

393
00:52:29,276 --> 00:52:30,930
<i>The Pink Opaque.</i>

394
00:52:41,810 --> 00:52:44,073
Of course, I remember
<i>The Pink Opaque.</i>

395
00:52:44,944 --> 00:52:49,078
It's my favorite TV
show of all time.

396
00:52:51,255 --> 00:52:52,865
Always will be.

397
00:52:55,737 --> 00:52:58,826
That's all you wanted to ask me,

398
00:52:58,827 --> 00:53:00,742
if I remembered <i>The Pink Opaque?</i>

399
00:53:01,656 --> 00:53:02,918
No.

400
00:53:04,442 --> 00:53:06,095
I guess what I mean is...

401
00:53:08,489 --> 00:53:11,231
When you think back on
watching <i>The Pink Opaque,</i>

402
00:53:14,191 --> 00:53:15,757
how do you remember it?

403
00:53:17,324 --> 00:53:20,762
How do I remember it?

404
00:53:21,894 --> 00:53:23,374
Yeah.

405
00:53:23,896 --> 00:53:26,855
Do you remember it
as just a TV show?

406
00:53:33,514 --> 00:53:36,909
Yeah. I remember
it as a TV show.

407
00:53:38,563 --> 00:53:42,131
<i>The Pink Opaque</i> was a TV show.

408
00:53:44,003 --> 00:53:46,962
We watched it in your
basement on Saturday nights

409
00:53:48,225 --> 00:53:52,228
from 10:30 to 11:00
p.m. Remember?

410
00:53:52,229 --> 00:53:55,100
The last show before
the Young Adult Network

411
00:53:55,101 --> 00:53:57,277
switched to black and
white reruns for the night.

412
00:54:00,846 --> 00:54:02,064
Yeah.

413
00:54:04,937 --> 00:54:06,199
But are you sure?

414
00:54:09,246 --> 00:54:11,160
Are you sure that's all it was?

415
00:54:33,226 --> 00:54:34,358
<i>Listen.</i>

416
00:54:35,533 --> 00:54:39,014
I know this might
sound crazy, but...

417
00:54:41,669 --> 00:54:44,281
When you think back
on <i>The Pink Opaque,</i>

418
00:54:44,846 --> 00:54:46,760
when you remember
watching it in my basement

419
00:54:46,761 --> 00:54:49,938
on Saturday nights from
10:30 to 11:00 p.m.,

420
00:54:51,549 --> 00:54:54,987
do you ever get confused?

421
00:54:56,597 --> 00:55:00,297
Like, maybe the memory
isn't quite right?

422
00:55:02,342 --> 00:55:04,301
What do you mean
"not quite right"?

423
00:55:07,347 --> 00:55:08,740
Like...

424
00:55:09,828 --> 00:55:13,179
Does time ever feel like
it's not moving normally?

425
00:55:17,183 --> 00:55:20,229
Like it's all out of whack?

426
00:55:21,579 --> 00:55:24,885
Do you ever feel like you're
narrating your own life

427
00:55:24,886 --> 00:55:26,887
watching it play in front of you

428
00:55:26,888 --> 00:55:29,716
like an episode of television?

429
00:55:29,717 --> 00:55:31,805
Or do you ever have a
hard time distinguishing

430
00:55:31,806 --> 00:55:33,677
between what
happened in the show

431
00:55:33,678 --> 00:55:35,767
and what happened in real life?

432
00:55:38,073 --> 00:55:40,815
Like somehow the memories
got jumbled around?

433
00:55:44,210 --> 00:55:46,080
Shook up in your head.

434
00:55:46,081 --> 00:55:47,648
Like a snow globe.

435
00:55:54,829 --> 00:55:56,701
I'm trying to go slow.

436
00:55:57,484 --> 00:55:59,356
I don't want to alarm you.

437
00:56:00,008 --> 00:56:01,835
<i>Maybe we should
talk to somebody,</i>

438
00:56:01,836 --> 00:56:03,620
<i>the police or my dad...</i>

439
00:56:03,621 --> 00:56:04,883
No!

440
00:56:06,580 --> 00:56:08,669
You can't tell
anybody about this.

441
00:56:09,235 --> 00:56:11,149
Not like last time.

442
00:56:11,150 --> 00:56:13,369
You have to promise.

443
00:56:13,370 --> 00:56:16,415
Okay, Maddy. Jesus.

444
00:56:16,416 --> 00:56:19,200
Yeah, I promise.

445
00:56:19,201 --> 00:56:22,160
I came a very long
way to see you,

446
00:56:22,161 --> 00:56:23,380
and to ask you this...

447
00:56:27,384 --> 00:56:29,036
Will you just...

448
00:56:29,037 --> 00:56:33,519
Will you tell me where
you've been all these years?

449
00:56:33,520 --> 00:56:36,175
That's what I've
been trying to do.

450
00:56:38,656 --> 00:56:40,048
I've been there.

451
00:56:41,789 --> 00:56:43,400

00:58:15,013 --> 00:58:16,536
I'm going back there.

00:58:21,715 --> 00:58:23,500

475
00:58:28,156 --> 00:58:29,984

476
00:58:31,159 --> 00:58:33,422

Mr. Melancholy.

479
00:58:40,604 --> 00:58:43,432
I'll be at the high school
tomorrow night at midnight.

480
00:58:45,391 --> 00:58:46,914
I hope you'll come.

481
00:59:17,466 --> 00:59:20,773
A little while after
Maddy disappeared,

482
00:59:20,774 --> 00:59:23,124
<i>she sent me one more

483

<i>If we're going to

485
00:59:31,655 --> 00:59:32,872
we're going to need to harness

486
00:59:32,873 --> 00:59:34,918
the full potential
of our shared powers.

487
00:59:34,919 --> 00:59:36,319
<i>We're going to need
to meet again...</i>

488
00:59:37,443 --> 00:59:39,444
in person.

489
00:59:39,445 --> 00:59:43,622
Isabel follows the
sound of Tara's voice

490
00:59:43,623 --> 00:59:45,406
<i>in the psychic
plane... Isabel?</i>

491
00:59:45,407 --> 00:59:46,712
<i>Tara?

<i>She finds her at the

00:59:53,590 --> 00:59:57,855
<i>the place where they first
spoke five seasons ago.</i>

495
01:00:04,775 --> 01:00:09,474
But then, as Isabel approaches,

496
01:00:09,475 --> 01:00:11,042
she picks something up.

497
01:00:15,002 --> 01:00:18,309
<i>A stray signal from
the psychic plane.</i>

498
01:00:18,310 --> 01:00:20,572
<i>Help me. Help me.</i>

499
01:00:20,573 --> 01:00:24,403
It's a desperate
message from Tara.

500
01:00:24,795 --> 01:00:26,274
<i>The real Tara.</i>

501
01:00:28,015 --> 01:00:30,017
She's buried underground...

502
01:00:31,584 --> 01:00:33,454
in terrible danger.

503
01:00:33,455 --> 01:00:35,196
<i>Help me, Isabel.</i>

504
01:00:40,419 --> 01:00:44,162
<i>Mr. Melancholy had
got to her first.</i>

505
01:00:49,689 --> 01:00:51,343
Marco.

506
01:00:55,434 --> 01:00:56,522
Polo.

507
01:01:28,467 --> 01:01:31,296
<i>They cut out her heart.</i>

508
01:01:46,180 --> 01:01:48,661
<i>They feed her the Luna Juice.</i>

509
01:02:00,542 --> 01:02:04,416
<i>And then he makes his entrance.</i>

510
01:02:05,547 --> 01:02:07,853
<i>Mr. Melancholy...</i>

511
01:02:07,854 --> 01:02:09,769
<i>the big bad.</i>

512
01:02:29,746 --> 01:02:31,269
Don't fight it.

513
01:02:34,272 --> 01:02:39,538
Let my poison work its magic.

514
01:02:43,803 --> 01:02:45,195
You're gonna love
the Midnight Realm.

515
01:02:45,196 --> 01:02:50,027
It's such a wonderful,
wonderful prison.

516
01:03:06,086 --> 01:03:07,566
It's okay.

517
01:03:10,438 --> 01:03:14,703
Soon you won't
remember anything.

518
01:03:16,444 --> 01:03:18,229
Your real name.

519
01:03:19,839 --> 01:03:21,754
Your superpowers.

520
01:03:23,103 --> 01:03:24,670
Your heart.

521
01:03:28,065 --> 01:03:31,982
You won't even remember
that you're dying!

522
01:04:02,186 --> 01:04:05,885
<i>They bury her... alive.</i>

523
01:04:24,556 --> 01:04:26,253
<i>And then...</i>

524
01:04:31,345 --> 01:04:32,869
<i>it just ended...</i>

525
01:04:34,131 --> 01:04:35,523
<i>forever.</i>

526
01:05:25,617 --> 01:05:28,315
This isn't my home!

527
01:05:32,406 --> 01:05:35,322
You're not my father!

528
01:06:55,402 --> 01:06:56,837
I made it all the way to Phoenix

529
01:06:56,838 --> 01:06:58,579
on the money I had saved.

530
01:07:01,321 --> 01:07:03,540
The trees looked different,

531
01:07:03,541 --> 01:07:06,065
but everything else
was exactly the same.

532
01:07:09,938 --> 01:07:11,766
I started using a new name.

533
01:07:13,594 --> 01:07:16,423
Sleeping at the cheapest
hostel I could find.

534
01:07:21,167 --> 01:07:23,474
<i>The Pink Opaque</i> was over.

535
01:07:36,574 --> 01:07:38,619
<i>I got a job at the mall.</i>

536
01:07:39,359 --> 01:07:40,752
At Build-A-Bear.

537
01:07:41,579 --> 01:07:43,972
Filling the dolls
up with stuffing.

538
01:07:46,627 --> 01:07:48,759
I got out of that town.

539
01:07:48,760 --> 01:07:51,545
That place I knew would
kill me if I stayed.

540
01:07:53,330 --> 01:07:55,375
But something was still wrong.

541
01:07:56,985 --> 01:07:58,465
Wronger, even.

542
01:08:02,469 --> 01:08:03,949
<i>Time wasn't right.</i>

543
01:08:09,389 --> 01:08:11,478
It was moving too fast.

544
01:08:14,394 --> 01:08:17,702
And then I was 19.
And then I was 20.

545
01:08:20,444 --> 01:08:21,966
I felt like one of those dolls,

546
01:08:21,967 --> 01:08:23,751
asleep in the supermarket.

547
01:08:24,622 --> 01:08:25,710
Stuffed.

548
01:08:28,234 --> 01:08:29,931
And then I was 21.

549
01:08:31,672 --> 01:08:34,632
Like chapters skipped
over on a DVD.

550
01:08:45,904 --> 01:08:47,601
<i>I told myself...</i>

551
01:08:48,602 --> 01:08:50,038
<i>"This isn't normal."</i>

552
01:08:52,345 --> 01:08:53,868
<i>"This isn't normal."</i>

553
01:08:56,044 --> 01:08:58,569
<i>This isn't how life
is supposed to be.</i>

554
01:09:00,658 --> 01:09:02,877
<i>I thought about
running away again.</i>

555
01:09:04,444 --> 01:09:05,705
<i>About moving to Santa Fe</i>

556
01:09:05,706 --> 01:09:08,144
<i>and changing my
name one more time.</i>

557
01:09:10,450 --> 01:09:13,149
<i>But I knew that everywhere
would be just the same.</i>

558
01:09:14,324 --> 01:09:16,064
<i>I had seen how it ended.</i>

559
01:09:17,370 --> 01:09:18,806
<i>I knew where I was.</i>

560
01:09:26,205 --> 01:09:29,120
A little bit after
my 22nd birthday,

561
01:09:29,121 --> 01:09:30,339
I paid this burnout kid

562
01:09:30,340 --> 01:09:32,341
who used to hit on
me in the food court

563
01:09:32,342 --> 01:09:34,866
$50 to bury me alive.

564
01:09:37,999 --> 01:09:39,087
I mean...

565
01:09:40,306 --> 01:09:42,656
he didn't know he
was burying me alive,

566
01:09:43,875 --> 01:09:46,921
but I doubt he would have
cared too much even if he did.

567
01:09:51,404 --> 01:09:53,189
I bought a coffin.

568
01:09:54,364 --> 01:09:55,930
I dug a hole.

569
01:09:57,410 --> 01:10:00,848
I got inside and
I closed the lid.

570
01:10:04,591 --> 01:10:06,202
I said to myself,

571
01:10:07,638 --> 01:10:09,248
"This is crazy."

572
01:10:10,249 --> 01:10:12,033
"What you're doing is crazy."

573
01:10:15,820 --> 01:10:18,126
But another part of me
knew that it wasn't.

574
01:10:20,477 --> 01:10:22,130
That it was survival.

575
01:10:25,699 --> 01:10:28,701
And that I didn't
have much time.

576
01:10:28,702 --> 01:10:30,486
That what felt like
years in this world

577
01:10:30,487 --> 01:10:32,532
was actually just seconds.

578
01:10:41,454 --> 01:10:42,977
So I waited.

579
01:10:48,287 --> 01:10:50,158
And then finally,

580
01:10:53,031 --> 01:10:56,426
the first spadeful of dirt
hit the top of the box.

581
01:10:59,429 --> 01:11:00,995
And then another.

582
01:11:03,215 --> 01:11:04,738
And then another.

583
01:11:11,832 --> 01:11:13,878
I sang songs to myself.

584
01:11:15,749 --> 01:11:18,970
I counted to 10,000 without
skipping any numbers.

585
01:11:22,147 --> 01:11:24,105
I pissed and I shit my pants

586
01:11:24,802 --> 01:11:26,019
and I forced my mouth

587
01:11:26,020 --> 01:11:29,022
to produce whatever
saliva it could muster

588
01:11:29,023 --> 01:11:31,330
just so I would have
something to drink.

589
01:11:42,602 --> 01:11:45,170
I screamed as loud
as I could for help.

590
01:11:46,519 --> 01:11:49,347
I apologized for
the whole thing.

591
01:11:49,348 --> 01:11:52,917
And I begged God for someone
to come along and save me.

592
01:11:53,918 --> 01:11:57,616
I tried and tried
to claw my way out,

593
01:11:57,617 --> 01:12:00,664
but that burnout guy had
packed the dirt in too tight

594
01:12:01,621 --> 01:12:03,797
just like I had asked him to do.

595
01:12:09,020 --> 01:12:10,630
And then,

596
01:12:12,632 --> 01:12:14,895
after I don't know how long,

597
01:12:17,420 --> 01:12:20,727
I felt myself start
to leave myself.

598
01:12:23,817 --> 01:12:25,470
And it was like I
was watching myself

599
01:12:25,471 --> 01:12:27,734
on TV from across the room.

600
01:12:29,823 --> 01:12:31,346
And I was moving further

601
01:12:31,347 --> 01:12:33,349
and further away from the screen

602
01:12:34,654 --> 01:12:36,220
until the screen was so small

603
01:12:36,221 --> 01:12:39,093
that I couldn't even
see myself anymore.

604
01:13:00,419 --> 01:13:03,683
And then I was clawing my
way up out of the ground.

605
01:13:04,989 --> 01:13:06,990
And then I was at the surface,

606
01:13:06,991 --> 01:13:11,473
gasping for air, rain
pouring down on me.

607
01:13:11,474 --> 01:13:13,084
Thunder and lightning.

608
01:13:15,391 --> 01:13:17,262
And I was finally back there.

609
01:13:19,003 --> 01:13:21,179
Back at our old sleepaway camp.

610
01:13:26,097 --> 01:13:29,143
And just like I was waking
up from a bad dream,

611
01:13:29,840 --> 01:13:32,276
that whole life...

612
01:13:32,277 --> 01:13:35,759
that whole reality where
I was Maddy Wilson...

613
01:13:36,673 --> 01:13:38,283
drifted away.

614
01:13:39,415 --> 01:13:41,154
Like a brief hallucination

615
01:13:41,155 --> 01:13:44,289
that, after a few moments, I
could hardly even remember.

616
01:13:45,464 --> 01:13:48,467
And all those memories
that had felt so real

617
01:13:49,860 --> 01:13:51,469
washed away with the rain

618
01:13:51,470 --> 01:13:53,646
back at our old sleepaway camp.

619
01:13:56,432 --> 01:13:57,911
And I was me.

620
01:13:58,695 --> 01:14:00,740
I was finally me again.

621
01:14:02,525 --> 01:14:04,788
And it was the
season six premiere.

622
01:14:08,661 --> 01:14:11,271
I tried looking for you,

623
01:14:11,272 --> 01:14:14,362
but Mr. Melancholy had
covered his tracks too well.

624
01:14:15,755 --> 01:14:18,583
I knew you must be buried
somewhere close by,

625
01:14:18,584 --> 01:14:20,107
but I didn't know where.

626
01:14:21,500 --> 01:14:23,849
And your signal...

627
01:14:23,850 --> 01:14:26,243
That signal that I used to
be able to close my eyes

628
01:14:26,244 --> 01:14:27,767
and feel so vividly...

629
01:14:28,289 --> 01:14:30,377
was nowhere.

630
01:14:30,378 --> 01:14:33,294
I wasn't picking up anything
on the psychic plane.

631
01:14:39,779 --> 01:14:41,215
I found my heart.

632
01:14:43,479 --> 01:14:45,219
Isabel, oh, my God!

633
01:14:45,959 --> 01:14:47,526
I found yours, too.

634
01:14:48,962 --> 01:14:50,834
And it was still beating,

635
01:14:52,444 --> 01:14:56,143
stored indefinitely in...

636
01:14:57,667 --> 01:14:59,973
In an industrial freezer!

637
01:15:04,935 --> 01:15:05,978
I left our hearts there

638
01:15:05,979 --> 01:15:07,894
because I knew I
wasn't done yet.

639
01:15:09,809 --> 01:15:12,159
And I found
Mr. Melancholy's cauldron.

640
01:15:12,725 --> 01:15:13,899
I found the Luna Juice

641
01:15:13,900 --> 01:15:17,033
he used to send us to
the Midnight Realm,

642
01:15:17,034 --> 01:15:20,037
then I took a big sip
straight out from the ladle.

643
01:15:21,908 --> 01:15:23,431
And I laid back down...

644
01:15:25,303 --> 01:15:27,566
and I waited to
fall back asleep.

645
01:15:30,308 --> 01:15:32,571
I knew I needed
to come back here.

646
01:15:34,181 --> 01:15:36,967
I knew I needed to
come back and save you.

647
01:15:39,578 --> 01:15:41,928
So that the show can continue.

648
01:15:43,016 --> 01:15:45,497
So that we can
get to season six.

649
01:15:50,328 --> 01:15:51,547
Maddy.

650
01:15:54,201 --> 01:15:55,986
That's not my name.

651
01:15:57,422 --> 01:15:59,118
And I haven't told
you anything tonight

652
01:15:59,119 --> 01:16:01,034
that you don't already know.

653
01:16:05,735 --> 01:16:07,040
Tell me.

654
01:16:08,999 --> 01:16:10,609
Tell me you know it's true.

655
01:16:15,309 --> 01:16:17,050
I...

656
01:16:18,835 --> 01:16:21,098
You told me yourself
you felt it.

657
01:16:22,969 --> 01:16:26,190
Remember? On the bleachers?

658
01:16:27,017 --> 01:16:29,584
You know what he put inside you.

659
01:16:29,585 --> 01:16:32,892
This... This is insane. I...

660
01:16:33,719 --> 01:16:36,243
I remember... I remember...

661
01:16:38,071 --> 01:16:40,333
playing in the snow.

662
01:16:40,334 --> 01:16:44,600
Driving to baseball
games with my dad.

663
01:16:45,513 --> 01:16:47,340
Cooking with my mom.

664
01:16:47,341 --> 01:16:50,214
Those memories were put
there to distract you.

665
01:16:51,911 --> 01:16:53,609
To keep you trapped.

666
01:16:59,440 --> 01:17:02,095
This isn't the
Midnight Realm, Maddy,

667
01:17:03,401 --> 01:17:05,185
it's just the suburbs.

668
01:17:13,150 --> 01:17:15,413
I told you that's not my name.

669
01:17:19,199 --> 01:17:21,637
And we need to go back
down into the soil.

670
01:17:23,290 --> 01:17:24,422
Tonight.

671
01:17:25,945 --> 01:17:27,643
The longer you wait

672
01:17:28,905 --> 01:17:31,385
the closer you get
to suffocating.

673
01:17:36,608 --> 01:17:38,262
<i>I've got everything ready.</i>

674
01:17:40,264 --> 01:17:43,309
<i>That spot behind
the football field</i>

675
01:17:43,310 --> 01:17:46,313
<i>where the stoners used
to get high after school.</i>

676
01:17:49,665 --> 01:17:51,231
<i>No one will find us there.</i>

677
01:18:26,005 --> 01:18:27,311
Come on.

678
01:18:28,921 --> 01:18:31,576
I know it's scary.
That's part of it.

679
01:18:46,852 --> 01:18:48,462
It's like the Drain Lords.

680
01:18:49,333 --> 01:18:51,422
Just like the Drain Lords.

681
01:18:53,337 --> 01:18:56,209
It's not real if I
don't think about it.

682
01:18:57,167 --> 01:18:58,559
Isabel.

683
01:19:58,184 --> 01:20:00,795
<i>After that night on
the football field,</i>

684
01:20:00,796 --> 01:20:02,623
<i>I locked myself inside.</i>

685
01:20:04,190 --> 01:20:06,366
<i>I didn't leave the
house for days.</i>

686
01:20:08,281 --> 01:20:11,283
<i>I kept waiting for
her to show back up</i>

687
01:20:11,284 --> 01:20:13,199
<i>to force me underground.</i>

688
01:20:17,813 --> 01:20:19,510
But she never did.

689
01:20:20,163 --> 01:20:22,208
I never saw her again.

690
01:20:28,693 --> 01:20:31,521
<i>I told myself I made
the right choice.</i>

691
01:20:31,522 --> 01:20:34,873
<i>Maddy's story was insane.
It couldn't be true.</i>

692
01:20:37,745 --> 01:20:39,398
<i>But some nights,</i>

693
01:20:39,399 --> 01:20:41,836
<i>when I was working late
at the movie theater,</i>

694
01:20:41,837 --> 01:20:45,752
<i>I found myself wondering,
what if she was right?</i>

695
01:20:45,753 --> 01:20:48,365
<i>What if she had been
telling the truth?</i>

696
01:20:49,409 --> 01:20:51,847
<i>What if I really
was someone else?</i>

697
01:20:53,457 --> 01:20:56,851
<i>Someone beautiful and powerful.</i>

698
01:20:56,852 --> 01:21:00,420
<i>Someone buried alive and
suffocating to death.</i>

699
01:21:01,639 --> 01:21:02,987
<i>Very far away,</i>

700
01:21:02,988 --> 01:21:04,816
<i>on the other side of
the television screen.</i>

701
01:21:08,341 --> 01:21:10,821
<i>But I know that's not true.</i>

702
01:21:10,822 --> 01:21:12,824
<i>That's just fantasy.</i>

703
01:21:14,391 --> 01:21:15,827
<i>Kid's stuff.</i>

704
01:21:39,024 --> 01:21:42,070
<i>The movie theater
closed the next fall.</i>

705
01:21:42,071 --> 01:21:43,854
<i>My manager brought
me along with him</i>

706
01:21:43,855 --> 01:21:46,422
<i>to the Fun Center.</i>

707
01:21:46,423 --> 01:21:50,514
<i>I work there now restocking
the ball pit with balls.</i>

708
01:21:54,387 --> 01:21:58,609
<i>My father passed away in
2010 after his second stroke.</i>

709
01:22:00,002 --> 01:22:02,786
<i>Time moves fast these days.</i>

710
01:22:02,787 --> 01:22:05,528
<i>Years pass like seconds.</i>

711
01:22:05,529 --> 01:22:08,314
<i>I just try not to think
too hard about it.</i>

712
01:22:11,752 --> 01:22:13,929
<i>I decided to stay in the house.</i>

713
01:22:15,278 --> 01:22:17,671
<i>It was time for me
to become a man.</i>

714
01:22:18,716 --> 01:22:20,543
<i>A real adult.</i>

715
01:22:20,544 --> 01:22:22,850
<i>A productive member of society.</i>

716
01:22:23,808 --> 01:22:25,723
<i>And that's exactly what I did.</i>

717
01:22:29,553 --> 01:22:32,207
I even got a family of my own.

718
01:22:32,208 --> 01:22:34,297
I love them more than anything.

719
01:23:32,877 --> 01:23:35,052
Anyway, like I was saying,

720
01:23:35,053 --> 01:23:37,620
it was raining the other
night and I couldn't sleep,

721
01:23:37,621 --> 01:23:39,971
so I started <i>The
Pink Opaque</i> again.

722
01:23:42,713 --> 01:23:45,019
<i>It's available to stream now.</i>

723
01:23:45,020 --> 01:23:46,934
<i>You don't even need a disc.</i>

724
01:23:51,069 --> 01:23:53,419
<i>I started</i> The Pink Opaque <i>again.</i>

725
01:23:55,465 --> 01:23:58,033
<i>And it was nothing
like I remembered it.</i>

726
01:23:59,034 --> 01:24:00,861
<i>Hey, Mr. Ice Cream Man.</i>

727
01:24:02,298 --> 01:24:04,995
<i>Stop turning all my friends
into popsicle sticks!</i>

728
01:24:04,996 --> 01:24:06,344
<i>But I'm so lonely.</i>

729
01:24:06,345 --> 01:24:08,520
<i>I have nothing to do all winter.</i>

730
01:24:08,521 --> 01:24:11,567
<i>The whole thing felt
cheesy and cheap.</i>

731
01:24:11,568 --> 01:24:13,961
<i>Dated, and not scary at all.</i>

732
01:24:19,141 --> 01:24:20,663
[ON TV] <i>I know!</i>

733
01:24:20,664 --> 01:24:22,317
<i>In the winter time, instead
of selling ice cream,</i>

734
01:24:22,318 --> 01:24:24,450
<i>you can sell soup instead.</i>

735
01:24:27,149 --> 01:24:29,498
<i>Why didn't I think of that?</i>

736
01:24:29,499 --> 01:24:31,369
<i>Let's all have a soup party!</i>

737
01:24:31,370 --> 01:24:33,894
<i>Yay, a soup party!</i>

738
01:24:45,776 --> 01:24:47,821
<i>I just felt embarrassed.</i>

01:25:25,598 --> 01:25:27,165
