1
00:01:51,884 --> 00:01:54,262
Hey. Come here. I got you.

2
00:01:54,970 --> 00:01:57,576
- I'm so sorry.
- Hey, you're gonna be okay.

3
00:01:57,577 --> 00:02:00,184
I'm so sorry
you couldn't be here, honey.

4
00:02:00,309 --> 00:02:03,854
I don't know what we're gonna do.
What are we gonna do?

5
00:02:09,150 --> 00:02:10,485
Okay.

6
00:02:10,486 --> 00:02:11,946
Oh, God.
We have to pick flowers.

7
00:02:11,947 --> 00:02:13,154
We do, yeah.

8
00:02:13,155 --> 00:02:16,283
I can't believe we're picking flowers
for your father's funeral.

9
00:02:16,284 --> 00:02:17,575
I know. I know.

10
00:02:17,576 --> 00:02:20,204
I don't know why you moved.
I don't understand it.

11
00:02:20,205 --> 00:02:22,644
I mean, if I had
that job that you had...

12
00:02:22,645 --> 00:02:25,083
Oh, boy,
I would've killed for that job.

13
00:02:25,084 --> 00:02:28,921
I appreciate your support
and enthusiasm, Mom. I really do.

14
00:02:28,922 --> 00:02:30,756
I love you.
I'm gonna go set my stuff down.

15
00:02:30,757 --> 00:02:31,839
Okay.

16
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:33,675
- It's lilies.
- What?

17
00:02:33,676 --> 00:02:35,803
The flowers for a funeral.
They're...

18
00:02:35,804 --> 00:02:37,054
Oh, lilies.

19
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:40,140
I'm so...
I'm so glad you're home.

20
00:02:40,766 --> 00:02:41,892
Me, too.

21
00:03:30,900 --> 00:03:32,318
He really loved you.

22
00:03:33,194 --> 00:03:34,195
Who?

23
00:03:35,154 --> 00:03:36,572
Your father.

24
00:03:39,533 --> 00:03:40,971
I know. I, um...

25
00:03:40,972 --> 00:03:42,411
Yeah, I know.

26
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:47,123
How's the eulogy coming, hon?

27
00:03:47,124 --> 00:03:51,462
Mm. It is, uh, one of the most
beautiful things I've never written.

28
00:03:51,463 --> 00:03:54,340
Just say five things
you loved about your father.

29
00:03:54,341 --> 00:03:56,800
Mama, it's...
it's not a grocery list.

30
00:03:56,801 --> 00:03:59,094
Just five... five things.

31
00:04:00,304 --> 00:04:01,387
Simple.

32
00:04:01,388 --> 00:04:02,722
From the heart.

33
00:04:02,723 --> 00:04:05,226
You're gonna be great.
It's gonna be great.

34
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:08,603
We're here to honor

35
00:04:08,604 --> 00:04:11,774
the prestigious,
generous Andrew Bloom.

36
00:04:12,942 --> 00:04:16,236
Deeply beloved mayor
of this fair town.

37
00:04:16,861 --> 00:04:20,449
Husband of the highly adored
Jenny Bloom.

38
00:04:21,116 --> 00:04:24,160
And father to
the wonderful and sweet Lily.

39
00:04:24,161 --> 00:04:27,206
Lily, come on up
to the stage, darling.

40
00:04:35,589 --> 00:04:38,259
Uh, hello.
Thank you all for joining us.

41
00:04:40,344 --> 00:04:44,390
In honor of my father's life,
I would, um, like to share with you

42
00:04:44,391 --> 00:04:46,850
the... the five things that
I love most about him.

43
00:04:54,942 --> 00:04:56,986
He...

44
00:05:15,379 --> 00:05:16,546
I'm sorry.

45
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:54,019
It's a strong chair.

46
00:06:55,062 --> 00:06:56,063
Is it?

47
00:06:59,441 --> 00:07:00,651
I'm... I'm sorry.

48
00:07:01,735 --> 00:07:02,987
It's... It's been a day.

49
00:07:07,825 --> 00:07:09,577
Will you please
get down from there?

50
00:07:10,411 --> 00:07:12,871
I'm... I'm good. Thanks.

51
00:07:12,872 --> 00:07:14,957
It's making me nervous
sitting so close to the edge.

52
00:07:17,751 --> 00:07:18,961
Please?

53
00:07:22,715 --> 00:07:24,216
Cherry on top?

54
00:07:26,844 --> 00:07:28,053
I'm okay.

55
00:07:29,471 --> 00:07:30,556
You gotta be...

56
00:07:50,784 --> 00:07:53,077
I once read that
maraschino cherries

57
00:07:53,078 --> 00:07:55,456
stay in your stomach
for, like, seven years.

58
00:07:55,457 --> 00:07:57,917
Or cause cancer. I forget which.

59
00:08:01,253 --> 00:08:03,505
I didn't know that
about maraschino cherries.

60
00:08:04,423 --> 00:08:06,634
Yeah, I may have made that up,

61
00:08:07,968 --> 00:08:09,135
but they're pretty gross.

62
00:08:09,136 --> 00:08:10,930
Yeah, they're definitely gross.

63
00:08:11,055 --> 00:08:12,681
So, what happened?

64
00:08:13,557 --> 00:08:14,558
Sorry?

65
00:08:15,434 --> 00:08:17,937
What was that over...
I didn't mean to, but...

66
00:08:20,481 --> 00:08:21,607
Was it a woman?

67
00:08:22,274 --> 00:08:23,275
Or man? I...

68
00:08:24,568 --> 00:08:26,946
It was a chair, wasn't it?

69
00:08:29,031 --> 00:08:30,032
Yes.

70
00:08:32,243 --> 00:08:33,619
So, what floor you live on?

71
00:08:33,620 --> 00:08:34,787
You first.

72
00:08:35,955 --> 00:08:38,249
Top floor, right next to
my sister and her husband.

73
00:08:39,124 --> 00:08:40,458
Oh.

74
00:08:40,459 --> 00:08:41,919
What do you do for a living?

75
00:08:42,585 --> 00:08:43,629
Neurosurgeon.

76
00:08:47,299 --> 00:08:48,676
Is that funny?

77
00:08:49,802 --> 00:08:51,887
- Jesus. You're serious.
- Yeah.

78
00:08:53,722 --> 00:08:54,764
- Oh, really?
- Wow.

79
00:08:54,765 --> 00:08:56,933
Oh, my God.
Please. I'm so sorry.

80
00:08:56,934 --> 00:08:59,895
No, I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry.
You've spent way too...

81
00:08:59,896 --> 00:09:01,813
I'm sorry.

82
00:09:01,814 --> 00:09:04,984
You've spent way too much time in school
to have me laughing like this.

83
00:09:04,985 --> 00:09:06,526
I'm terrible.
I'm sorry.

84
00:09:06,527 --> 00:09:08,903
I... I thought
you were a crypto bro.

85
00:09:08,904 --> 00:09:10,906
- You thought I was a crypto bro?
- No, no, no.

86
00:09:10,907 --> 00:09:11,990
Yeah, no, well, I don't know,

87
00:09:11,991 --> 00:09:13,784
or like
a really expensive prostitute.

88
00:09:13,785 --> 00:09:15,577
Well, I am expensive.

89
00:09:15,578 --> 00:09:17,454
You can forget about
kissing on the mouth.

90
00:09:20,249 --> 00:09:21,250
Well...

91
00:09:22,585 --> 00:09:24,378
Why haven't I seen you before?

92
00:09:26,213 --> 00:09:28,883
Well, mostly because I've never
required brain surgery.

93
00:09:29,717 --> 00:09:31,719
But also
'cause I don't live here, so...

94
00:09:32,261 --> 00:09:33,929
So, you just
broke into my building?

95
00:09:33,930 --> 00:09:35,472
You have a really nice view.

96
00:09:36,724 --> 00:09:37,850
I do.

97
00:09:43,814 --> 00:09:44,815
What's your name?

98
00:09:45,649 --> 00:09:46,650
Lily.

99
00:09:47,735 --> 00:09:49,236
- You?
- Ryle.

100
00:09:49,237 --> 00:09:50,446
Ryle what?

101
00:09:50,863 --> 00:09:51,905
Kincaid.

102
00:09:51,906 --> 00:09:53,490
You just made that up just now.

103
00:09:53,491 --> 00:09:55,074
Why would I make up
my last name?

104
00:09:55,075 --> 00:09:56,994
- Well, I mean... Fine.
- What's your last name?

105
00:09:57,912 --> 00:09:59,662
It's fine. We don't need to...
We don't need to do this.

106
00:09:59,663 --> 00:10:01,874
- I'm just asking your last name.
- It was really nice meeting you.

107
00:10:01,875 --> 00:10:03,208
- Thank you. Just be careful.
- Okay.

108
00:10:03,209 --> 00:10:05,544
It would be courteous
to give me back your last name.

109
00:10:05,545 --> 00:10:06,711
I'm not gonna stalk you.

110
00:10:06,712 --> 00:10:09,048
No, it's just really...
It's sort of embarrassing.

111
00:10:09,049 --> 00:10:10,132
What is it?

112
00:10:10,674 --> 00:10:11,841
Bloom.

113
00:10:11,842 --> 00:10:13,802
- Your name is Lily Bloom?
- Yes.

114
00:10:13,803 --> 00:10:15,261
It... It actually gets worse.

115
00:10:15,262 --> 00:10:17,264
- Yeah. Yeah, no. It... It does.
- No way. Not possible.

116
00:10:17,265 --> 00:10:18,348
Than Lily Bloom?

117
00:10:18,349 --> 00:10:19,515
I don't wanna talk about it,

118
00:10:19,516 --> 00:10:20,851
'cause it's really
kind of embarrassing.

119
00:10:20,852 --> 00:10:22,645
I'm obsessed with flowers. I...

120
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:24,939
And I'm about to open
my first flower shop.

121
00:10:24,940 --> 00:10:26,022
Flower shop?

122
00:10:26,023 --> 00:10:27,650
Yeah, it's a lifelong dream,
so...

123
00:10:33,030 --> 00:10:35,615
Stop. I told you.

124
00:10:35,616 --> 00:10:38,077
No, Lily Bloom the florist.

125
00:10:39,286 --> 00:10:40,995
No, doesn't sound
made-up at all.

126
00:10:40,996 --> 00:10:42,915
Hey, you could always use
your middle name

127
00:10:42,916 --> 00:10:44,291
if it doesn't work out.

128
00:10:46,961 --> 00:10:48,190
- No, Violet.
- Trust me.

129
00:10:48,191 --> 00:10:49,421
- Petunia.
- No, stop.

130
00:10:49,422 --> 00:10:50,506
Of the valley.

131
00:10:51,674 --> 00:10:53,675
- Toadflax.
- Blossom.

132
00:10:53,676 --> 00:10:55,511
Goddamn, your parents hate you.

133
00:10:55,636 --> 00:10:57,867
Well, I mean,
we may never know for sure,

134
00:10:57,868 --> 00:10:59,879
'cause my dad
died on Monday, so, um...

135
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:01,892
Yeah, that's actually
why I came up here,

136
00:11:01,893 --> 00:11:03,977
to have a good cry and,

137
00:11:03,978 --> 00:11:05,813
hopefully,
meet a wealthy neurosurgeon.

138
00:11:06,981 --> 00:11:08,816
So...

139
00:11:09,817 --> 00:11:10,818
I'm sorry.

140
00:11:13,404 --> 00:11:15,593
I could've made it back,
um, you know,

141
00:11:15,594 --> 00:11:17,783
to see him before he died,
but I...

142
00:11:22,079 --> 00:11:23,080
I didn't.

143
00:11:25,875 --> 00:11:26,876
Damn.

144
00:11:29,336 --> 00:11:30,337
Yeah.

145
00:11:32,214 --> 00:11:35,092
Well, you know, naked truths
aren't always pretty.

146
00:11:46,145 --> 00:11:48,063
I watched
a little boy die tonight.

147
00:11:49,231 --> 00:11:50,816
He was only six years old.

148
00:11:51,150 --> 00:11:52,943
His brother found a gun
in his parents' bedroom,

149
00:11:52,944 --> 00:11:55,446
and it went off by accident.

150
00:11:56,947 --> 00:11:57,948
Tried everything.

151
00:12:02,286 --> 00:12:03,704
No one should have to...

152
00:12:05,206 --> 00:12:06,206
I can't imagine

153
00:12:06,207 --> 00:12:08,209
what that's gonna do
to that little boy who lived.

154
00:12:10,711 --> 00:12:13,839
Destroy him for life.
That's what it'll do.

155
00:12:18,928 --> 00:12:21,096
All right, give me another one.

156
00:12:22,097 --> 00:12:24,642
Naked truth. I like that.

157
00:12:27,353 --> 00:12:29,271
- Go on.
- Okay.

158
00:12:29,605 --> 00:12:32,650
I... I don't know... Uh...

159
00:12:36,904 --> 00:12:39,198
The first guy
I had sex with was homeless.

160
00:12:39,199 --> 00:12:40,281
Stop it.

161
00:12:40,282 --> 00:12:42,451
Yeah, no, really.
In high school, yeah.

162
00:12:43,202 --> 00:12:44,202
Tell me more.

163
00:12:44,203 --> 00:12:45,328
I actually think
we're supposed to say

164
00:12:45,329 --> 00:12:47,498
"temporarily un-homed,"
or, um, "displaced."

165
00:12:47,499 --> 00:12:48,581
I shouldn't have said...

166
00:12:48,582 --> 00:12:49,895
Now you're
avoiding the question.

167
00:12:49,896 --> 00:12:51,210
I'm not.
There's nothing to tell.

168
00:12:51,211 --> 00:12:52,335
I want the good stuff.

169
00:12:52,336 --> 00:12:54,296
Okay, I was friends with
this boy named Atlas.

170
00:12:54,297 --> 00:12:57,591
And he was
kind and incredibly capable

171
00:12:57,592 --> 00:13:00,135
and, you know,
he just got a shit hand.

172
00:13:00,136 --> 00:13:02,680
You're making me jealous
of a homeless man.

173
00:13:02,681 --> 00:13:04,264
Oh, my.

174
00:13:04,265 --> 00:13:06,267
Okay, that's enough. That's...

175
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:07,809
Your turn.

176
00:13:07,810 --> 00:13:10,396
Oh, no, I think I'm done.
Can't top that.

177
00:13:10,397 --> 00:13:12,480
That was
both sexy and disturbing.

178
00:13:12,481 --> 00:13:15,734
Okay, just shock me. Say...
I mean, you can say anything.

179
00:13:15,735 --> 00:13:17,027
I wanna have sex with you.

180
00:13:20,155 --> 00:13:23,033
- What? I mean...
- You said to shock you.

181
00:13:23,868 --> 00:13:24,869
What?

182
00:13:29,373 --> 00:13:31,207
How many... I'm sorry.

183
00:13:31,208 --> 00:13:33,335
How many women
has this worked on?

184
00:13:33,336 --> 00:13:34,878
I'm not a relationship person.

185
00:13:34,879 --> 00:13:36,630
- Yeah, I gathered that.
- Never been good at them.

186
00:13:36,631 --> 00:13:38,131
But how do you know

187
00:13:38,132 --> 00:13:40,551
if you've never tried
having a relationship or carbs?

188
00:13:40,552 --> 00:13:41,823
How do you know
it doesn't work for you?

189
00:13:41,824 --> 00:13:43,094
Carbs? I never said
I didn't eat carbs.

190
00:13:43,095 --> 00:13:44,930
Come on, you don't look
like a reckless snacker.

191
00:13:44,931 --> 00:13:46,432
Well, thank you.

192
00:13:46,807 --> 00:13:48,434
Love isn't for me.

193
00:13:49,518 --> 00:13:50,895
Lust is nice though.

194
00:13:52,813 --> 00:13:55,274
- I feel like you're missing out.
- Am I?

195
00:13:57,735 --> 00:13:59,904
You haven't
answered my question.

196
00:13:59,905 --> 00:14:02,448
Forgot what the question was.

197
00:14:02,740 --> 00:14:04,700
How many women
has this worked on?

198
00:14:06,827 --> 00:14:08,037
All of them.

199
00:14:10,789 --> 00:14:11,874
Oh.

200
00:14:15,586 --> 00:14:16,837
Well, I...

201
00:14:18,464 --> 00:14:19,840
I can't... I'm...

202
00:14:22,384 --> 00:14:23,927
I'm gonna have
to break your record.

203
00:14:23,928 --> 00:14:25,608
I'm the kind of girl
you take home to mama.

204
00:14:26,597 --> 00:14:27,640
How far would you go?

205
00:14:32,436 --> 00:14:34,813
I'm not sure.
I'm an unreliable narrator.

206
00:14:37,316 --> 00:14:38,567
You could try me.

207
00:15:05,928 --> 00:15:07,054
Too far?

208
00:15:08,556 --> 00:15:09,557
No.

209
00:15:17,064 --> 00:15:18,065
This?

210
00:15:18,941 --> 00:15:21,026
Depends what happens next.

211
00:15:24,447 --> 00:15:25,614
Ah, shit.

212
00:15:29,493 --> 00:15:30,494
Yeah.

213
00:15:32,413 --> 00:15:33,831
No, I'm not supposed to...

214
00:15:37,334 --> 00:15:39,128
Okay, prep the OR.
Tell Tom he's cutting.

215
00:15:39,129 --> 00:15:40,628
I'm gonna supervise.

216
00:15:40,629 --> 00:15:42,131
All right,
I'll be there in ten.

217
00:15:45,301 --> 00:15:47,218
- Holy shit.
- I know. I'm sorry.

218
00:15:47,219 --> 00:15:50,806
No, I mean, holy shit.
I... I... I just now realized

219
00:15:50,807 --> 00:15:53,871
you're actually a neurosurgeon.

220
00:15:53,872 --> 00:15:56,937
- I tried to warn you.
- No, congratulations.

221
00:15:56,938 --> 00:15:58,689
- That's... That's amazing.
- Yeah.

222
00:15:59,857 --> 00:16:01,692
I... This is...
You know, I...

223
00:16:02,484 --> 00:16:04,945
I'll see you around.

224
00:16:06,280 --> 00:16:07,364
Will you?

225
00:16:08,115 --> 00:16:09,450
No.

226
00:16:20,753 --> 00:16:23,881
It was nice meeting you,
Lily Blossom Bloom.

227
00:16:24,340 --> 00:16:27,134
It was nice meeting you,
Ryle Siegfried Kincaid.

228
00:16:29,178 --> 00:16:30,262
I like that.

229
00:17:06,631 --> 00:17:07,633
Oh, shit.

230
00:18:13,199 --> 00:18:14,200
Thank you.

231
00:19:56,302 --> 00:19:57,303
Thank you.

232
00:19:58,470 --> 00:20:00,264
I don't know
what you're talking about.

233
00:20:17,114 --> 00:20:18,616
So, why are you at that house?

234
00:20:21,452 --> 00:20:22,786
My mom kicked me out.

235
00:20:23,704 --> 00:20:24,747
Why?

236
00:20:27,333 --> 00:20:28,334
Because...

237
00:20:29,501 --> 00:20:31,962
she likes dating guys
who beat the shit out of her.

238
00:20:36,508 --> 00:20:37,828
What happened to your hand?

239
00:20:38,093 --> 00:20:40,137
God, I can smell him
from here.

240
00:20:42,473 --> 00:20:43,766
It got in the way.

241
00:20:49,063 --> 00:20:51,690
Look, my parents don't get
home from work till around 5:00,

242
00:20:51,691 --> 00:20:54,318
so if you wanna shower or...

243
00:20:54,319 --> 00:20:56,946
I don't know, wash clothes or...

244
00:20:56,947 --> 00:20:58,739
- I don't mind.
- Yeah.

245
00:20:59,698 --> 00:21:00,741
Sure.

246
00:21:02,535 --> 00:21:04,370
Your enthusiasm's contagious.

247
00:21:13,921 --> 00:21:15,631
<i>Did you feel
the earthquake this weekend?</i>

248
00:21:15,632 --> 00:21:16,714
<i>Yeah!</i>

249
00:21:16,715 --> 00:21:18,654
<i>- You did?
- Yeah!</i>

250
00:21:18,655 --> 00:21:20,594
Hey.

251
00:21:21,679 --> 00:21:22,930
Thanks for the clothes.

252
00:21:23,889 --> 00:21:24,932
Yeah, of course.

253
00:21:25,891 --> 00:21:27,100
My dad won't even
know they're gone.

254
00:21:27,101 --> 00:21:29,562
He doesn't usually
wear jeans much, so...

255
00:21:33,983 --> 00:21:37,528
Um, my parents aren't gonna
be home for an hour or so,

256
00:21:37,529 --> 00:21:39,989
if you wanna watch TV
or something.

257
00:21:55,880 --> 00:21:58,299
So, uh, what do you wanna do
after you graduate?

258
00:21:58,924 --> 00:22:02,595
I'm, um... signed up to go to
basic training in May.

259
00:22:02,596 --> 00:22:04,096
Basic training. What is...

260
00:22:05,681 --> 00:22:06,682
In the Marines.

261
00:22:06,683 --> 00:22:07,850
Oh.

262
00:22:08,642 --> 00:22:09,643
Wow.

263
00:22:20,446 --> 00:22:22,323
I'm sorry. I'm...

264
00:22:23,282 --> 00:22:25,284
I'm sorry.
It's just the... the clothes...

265
00:22:25,285 --> 00:22:26,367
My dad's clothes,

266
00:22:26,368 --> 00:22:28,488
they make you kind of
look like Ned Flanders a little.

267
00:22:31,457 --> 00:22:33,209
Your clothes kind of
make you look like a carrot.

268
00:22:33,210 --> 00:22:34,960
- Oh, my God.
- Yeah.

269
00:22:45,346 --> 00:22:46,639
- Mom...
<i>- If it doesn't work out...</i>

270
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:48,349
Mom, you do know a challenge
only excites me.

271
00:22:48,350 --> 00:22:49,891
<i>I... I... I said, "If."</i>

272
00:22:49,892 --> 00:22:52,394
<i>"A flower sales statistic that
shocks many new store owners..."</i>

273
00:22:52,395 --> 00:22:54,230
Mom, what makes you think
it's not gonna work out?

274
00:22:54,231 --> 00:22:55,981
"...a whopping 45%
of all flowers die..."

275
00:22:55,982 --> 00:22:57,065
<i>Mom.</i>

276
00:22:57,066 --> 00:22:58,838
Mom, are you reading this
from Google?

277
00:22:58,839 --> 00:23:00,610
Of course I am.
How would I know that?

278
00:23:00,611 --> 00:23:02,904
I'm worried about you.
Google is worried about you.

279
00:23:02,905 --> 00:23:04,782
Well, you're both too late.
I'm picking up the keys now.

280
00:23:04,783 --> 00:23:05,907
<i>Okay, okay. Okay.</i>

281
00:23:05,908 --> 00:23:07,910
<i>- I love you. You can do this.</i>
- Wait. Sir! Sir! Hi.

282
00:23:07,911 --> 00:23:09,494
<i>- Make it bold and brave.</i>
- Okay, Mom.

283
00:23:09,495 --> 00:23:11,455
You sound crazy.
I'll talk to you later. Bye.

284
00:23:11,456 --> 00:23:13,540
Hi. I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry.

285
00:23:13,541 --> 00:23:16,377
- I, uh... I just moved here.
- Okay, sweetheart. Good luck.

286
00:23:19,421 --> 00:23:20,506
Thank you.

287
00:24:22,860 --> 00:24:23,903
Hi.

288
00:24:28,490 --> 00:24:29,783
- Hello.
- Hi.

289
00:24:29,909 --> 00:24:32,536
- Oh, sorry. Hi. Yeah. I'm sorry.
- I'm so sorry.

290
00:24:32,537 --> 00:24:34,079
I can't...

291
00:24:34,580 --> 00:24:35,956
- Oh, wait.
- I can't hear you. Hi.

292
00:24:36,874 --> 00:24:38,187
Hi. Can I help you?

293
00:24:38,188 --> 00:24:39,501
Can I help you?

294
00:24:39,502 --> 00:24:40,627
Excuse me?

295
00:24:40,628 --> 00:24:42,253
The "help wanted" sign
out front?

296
00:24:42,254 --> 00:24:43,671
You have a "help wanted" sign
out front.

297
00:24:43,672 --> 00:24:46,091
Oh, God. I'm so sorry. Yeah, I didn't...
I didn't put that out there.

298
00:24:46,092 --> 00:24:48,552
- I just, yeah, got this place.
- I figured. It's pretty old.

299
00:24:48,553 --> 00:24:49,929
And I walk by this place
every day,

300
00:24:49,930 --> 00:24:51,430
and I'm just obsessed with it.

301
00:24:51,431 --> 00:24:52,931
I've always wanted
to see inside,

302
00:24:52,932 --> 00:24:55,768
and I was wondering, like,
"Who's gonna come along?"

303
00:24:55,769 --> 00:24:57,707
- And it's you, yeah?
- No, it's me. Yeah, hi.

304
00:24:57,708 --> 00:24:59,647
- Are you the owner?
- Yeah, I'm... I'm Lily.

305
00:24:59,648 --> 00:25:00,773
- Allysa.
- Nice to meet you.

306
00:25:00,774 --> 00:25:02,190
Sorry. Ooh, disgusting.

307
00:25:02,191 --> 00:25:04,318
Hi. Nice to meet you. Yeah.

308
00:25:05,152 --> 00:25:07,696
Well, yeah,
are you looking for any help?

309
00:25:08,489 --> 00:25:10,240
Well, I'm not hiring just yet.

310
00:25:10,241 --> 00:25:12,201
I just... I just got the keys
a few days ago,

311
00:25:12,202 --> 00:25:14,244
and I'm still sort of, you know,

312
00:25:14,245 --> 00:25:16,287
figuring out
what I'm doing, so...

313
00:25:16,288 --> 00:25:19,250
Um, may I just ask,
what is this place going to be?

314
00:25:19,251 --> 00:25:20,376
A flower shop.

315
00:25:20,377 --> 00:25:21,752
Ugh.

316
00:25:23,754 --> 00:25:25,339
I'm so sorry. Um...

317
00:25:25,923 --> 00:25:27,298
I have an issue with...

318
00:25:27,299 --> 00:25:30,010
My face says it all.
I just hate flowers.

319
00:25:30,011 --> 00:25:31,365
You hate flowers?

320
00:25:31,366 --> 00:25:32,720
- I do.
- Oh, okay.

321
00:25:32,721 --> 00:25:35,099
Like, why don't you just
give me something that's living

322
00:25:35,100 --> 00:25:37,142
rather than something
that's on its way to dying?

323
00:25:37,143 --> 00:25:38,310
And then it's gonna create
more work for me,

324
00:25:38,311 --> 00:25:40,395
and I'm gonna
have to deal with that,

325
00:25:40,396 --> 00:25:42,480
but again,
it's a solo perspective.

326
00:25:42,481 --> 00:25:45,526
It's... I find flower shops
depressing. It's just me.

327
00:25:45,527 --> 00:25:47,403
I do wish you luck.
I'm so sorry.

328
00:25:47,404 --> 00:25:49,446
I agree. I find them depressing.

329
00:25:49,447 --> 00:25:51,489
Because I feel like...

330
00:25:51,490 --> 00:25:54,243
I don't know, it's like
the beauty of what a flower is...

331
00:25:54,244 --> 00:25:55,326
This is ridiculous.

332
00:25:55,327 --> 00:25:59,039
The beauty of what a flower is
has been lost, right? It's... It's, um...

333
00:25:59,707 --> 00:26:01,542
It's like we order them
like takeout now... It's... It's...

334
00:26:01,543 --> 00:26:02,625
- Yes.
- Right?

335
00:26:02,626 --> 00:26:04,168
It's what you're talking about.

336
00:26:04,169 --> 00:26:07,256
It's highlighting the pain
and the tension and the...

337
00:26:07,257 --> 00:26:09,842
You know,
the fact that it's fleeting

338
00:26:09,843 --> 00:26:11,343
and it's storytelling and...

339
00:26:11,802 --> 00:26:12,802
I don't know,

340
00:26:12,803 --> 00:26:14,305
that's actually what I find
beautiful about it, and...

341
00:26:14,306 --> 00:26:15,931
That's what I'm
trying to do here, so...

342
00:26:15,932 --> 00:26:18,558
That's absolutely beautiful.
I'm...

343
00:26:18,559 --> 00:26:22,187
If that's what you're doing,
yeah, sign me up. Wonderful.

344
00:26:22,188 --> 00:26:23,522
- Thanks, thanks.
- Oh...

345
00:26:24,064 --> 00:26:25,191
Well, um...

346
00:26:25,733 --> 00:26:27,526
Yeah, I really do
wish you the best.

347
00:26:27,527 --> 00:26:29,485
- Thank you.
- Um,

348
00:26:29,486 --> 00:26:32,114
and I'll just be lurking
around in the neighborhood.

349
00:26:32,115 --> 00:26:33,615
Hopefully, I made
my first customer.

350
00:26:33,616 --> 00:26:36,410
- Yeah. Yeah. Great. It's so gorgeous.
- Hope to see you...

351
00:26:36,411 --> 00:26:38,204
Yeah. Bye.

352
00:26:39,997 --> 00:26:41,081
Hey, I...

353
00:26:42,374 --> 00:26:43,792
I don't know, this...

354
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:47,296
I do need help.
Do you want a job?

355
00:26:47,297 --> 00:26:49,005
This is exactly what I wanted

356
00:26:49,006 --> 00:26:50,486
to happen to me
when I walked in here.

357
00:26:50,966 --> 00:26:52,738
- Yes.
- Oh, God. Okay.

358
00:26:52,739 --> 00:26:54,510
- Wonderful. Great.
- Okay.

359
00:26:54,511 --> 00:26:55,721
I have to be out
by 5:00 p.m. tonight.

360
00:26:55,722 --> 00:26:56,930
I do have a dinner.

361
00:26:56,931 --> 00:26:58,140
- Tonight?
- Yeah.

362
00:26:59,850 --> 00:27:01,060
I just started working here.

363
00:27:01,602 --> 00:27:03,311
- Okay, perfect.
- Great.

364
00:27:03,312 --> 00:27:05,356
I'm gonna just need to wipe off
a surface for this girl.

365
00:27:05,357 --> 00:27:06,648
Here. There you go.

366
00:27:06,649 --> 00:27:08,858
- That's, um...
- Thank you so much.

367
00:27:08,859 --> 00:27:11,278
It's a real <i>Ghostbusters</i>
situation in here, huh?

368
00:27:14,448 --> 00:27:15,950
- Hey. Frame it.
- Aww.

369
00:27:17,868 --> 00:27:19,787
Did you see that?

370
00:27:20,996 --> 00:27:22,497
Oh, my God. It's still attached.

371
00:27:22,498 --> 00:27:24,833
Oh, God, I can't watch.
Oh!

372
00:27:29,838 --> 00:27:31,340
Yeah. Yeah.

373
00:27:50,776 --> 00:27:55,781
You're like Dr. Frankenstein,
but with flowers.

374
00:27:56,282 --> 00:27:58,492
Okay. No, no, no.
We got it. We got it. We got it.

375
00:27:58,617 --> 00:28:00,285
I don't have it. Hold on.

376
00:28:00,286 --> 00:28:02,371
- Okay, here. Here we go.
- Hold on. My husband's calling.

377
00:28:02,372 --> 00:28:03,538
Can I ask him to help us?

378
00:28:03,539 --> 00:28:04,832
- Yes. No, please. Genius.
- Or is that weak?

379
00:28:04,833 --> 00:28:06,124
- You got it?
- Nope.

380
00:28:06,125 --> 00:28:07,333
<i>- Babe.</i>
- Not at all.

381
00:28:07,334 --> 00:28:09,169
<i>- Babe, the game's over. Where you at?</i>
- Hi, honey. Sweetheart.

382
00:28:09,170 --> 00:28:10,880
<i>- Where are you?</i>
- I'm at the shop with my boss.

383
00:28:10,881 --> 00:28:12,318
And we need some help
hanging something up.

384
00:28:12,319 --> 00:28:13,756
<i>I don't like
when you say "boss."</i>

385
00:28:13,757 --> 00:28:14,841
- Babe.
<i>- You should be the boss.</i>

386
00:28:14,842 --> 00:28:16,635
<i>Let's buy the place
and make you the boss.</i>

387
00:28:16,636 --> 00:28:18,011
Honey, you're on speaker.

388
00:28:18,012 --> 00:28:19,263
- Yeah. Just...
<i>- Oh, hi.</i>

389
00:28:19,264 --> 00:28:20,346
- Just...
- Hi.

390
00:28:20,347 --> 00:28:22,683
I want you to know that
they're gonna be wearing onesies.

391
00:28:22,684 --> 00:28:23,809
Because the bar gives free beer
to the people...

392
00:28:23,810 --> 00:28:24,893
<i>I can see you.</i>

393
00:28:24,894 --> 00:28:26,353
...who wear onesies
to the Bruins game,

394
00:28:26,354 --> 00:28:27,645
but they don't always wear that.

395
00:28:27,646 --> 00:28:29,543
<i>- I'm across the street.</i>
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

396
00:28:29,544 --> 00:28:31,441
<i>Oh, my God,
babe, you are stunning.</i>

397
00:28:31,442 --> 00:28:32,943
Can you
bring my brother in, too?

398
00:28:32,944 --> 00:28:34,695
Okay,
I can't take responsibility

399
00:28:34,696 --> 00:28:35,778
for either of the people

400
00:28:35,779 --> 00:28:37,740
who are about to come in here,
just so you know.

401
00:28:38,700 --> 00:28:39,909
- Hi.
- Hi.

402
00:28:41,619 --> 00:28:42,744
You look great.

403
00:28:42,745 --> 00:28:44,871
- This is Lily.
- Hi. Lily. Hi. Nice to meet you.

404
00:28:44,872 --> 00:28:47,082
- This is my husband, Marshall.
- I didn't mean the boss thing.

405
00:28:47,083 --> 00:28:48,417
That's my brother Ryle.

406
00:28:56,800 --> 00:28:58,219
Hi. Hi.

407
00:28:58,886 --> 00:28:59,886
- Hi.
- Lily.

408
00:28:59,887 --> 00:29:01,222
- Lily Bloom.
- Mm-hmm.

409
00:29:01,223 --> 00:29:02,431
Yes. Yes.

410
00:29:02,890 --> 00:29:04,767
- You guys know each other?
- No.

411
00:29:04,768 --> 00:29:06,247
- A little bit.
- No, we...

412
00:29:06,248 --> 00:29:07,727
We met a few months ago.

413
00:29:07,728 --> 00:29:09,521
We shared each other's
naked truths.

414
00:29:09,522 --> 00:29:10,730
Ew. Aw.

415
00:29:10,731 --> 00:29:12,024
- That's... Okay.
- No, that's...

416
00:29:12,025 --> 00:29:13,107
We're adults.

417
00:29:13,108 --> 00:29:14,944
- That was a bad choice of words.
- You said it.

418
00:29:14,945 --> 00:29:17,028
You said "naked truths" first.

419
00:29:17,029 --> 00:29:19,155
- No, we just talked.
- You're lying.

420
00:29:19,156 --> 00:29:21,075
That's what we're calling it
these days, "We talked"?

421
00:29:21,076 --> 00:29:23,159
- 'Cause we talk all the time.
- Great.

422
00:29:23,160 --> 00:29:24,453
We talk, like...
We talk, like, three to five times a week.

423
00:29:24,454 --> 00:29:25,537
Wonderful.

424
00:29:25,538 --> 00:29:27,540
Can I show you
the work that I've done here?

425
00:29:27,541 --> 00:29:28,624
We should talk?
We can talk tonight.

426
00:29:28,625 --> 00:29:29,832
No, we could hang this.

427
00:29:29,833 --> 00:29:30,959
No, let me
take you over here.

428
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:32,800
Let me talk to
your sister over here.

429
00:29:33,128 --> 00:29:34,463
- Okay.
- I mean, it is really good.

430
00:29:38,552 --> 00:29:39,635
We meet again.

431
00:29:40,469 --> 00:29:41,512
It's good to see you.

432
00:29:42,888 --> 00:29:44,097
So, this is the flower shop

433
00:29:44,098 --> 00:29:46,517
that my sister works at
'cause she's bored, huh?

434
00:29:46,518 --> 00:29:49,937
Oh, we like to say
"inspired" here, um,

435
00:29:49,938 --> 00:29:51,814
but, yeah, this is, um...

436
00:29:51,815 --> 00:29:53,524
You know, I... Yeah.

437
00:29:55,067 --> 00:29:56,068
Yeah.

438
00:29:58,237 --> 00:29:59,697
Looks like we will be seeing

439
00:29:59,947 --> 00:30:01,615
a little more of
each other then.

440
00:30:01,616 --> 00:30:03,032
Is that so?

441
00:30:03,033 --> 00:30:04,410
Babe, these are incredible.

442
00:30:04,411 --> 00:30:05,995
Thank you very much.

443
00:30:07,621 --> 00:30:09,748
You're even more terrifying
in the daytime.

444
00:30:09,749 --> 00:30:10,915
Same.

445
00:30:10,916 --> 00:30:12,626
Okay, guys, idea.

446
00:30:14,545 --> 00:30:16,171
Let's go have
some dumb fun today.

447
00:30:27,141 --> 00:30:28,559
I've gone up
to the roof a few times.

448
00:30:28,560 --> 00:30:30,144
Hoping you might be up there.

449
00:30:32,021 --> 00:30:33,314
<i>I wanna see you again.</i>

450
00:30:39,111 --> 00:30:40,446
Well, now you see me.

451
00:30:42,239 --> 00:30:43,324
You know what I mean.

452
00:30:46,827 --> 00:30:48,227
Okay.
Let's go, let's go.

453
00:30:48,787 --> 00:30:49,621
Mmm!

454
00:30:49,622 --> 00:30:51,582
But that's a bad idea, right?

455
00:30:51,583 --> 00:30:54,335
Because of my sister,
because of your business.

456
00:30:54,336 --> 00:30:55,752
Go, Lily!

457
00:30:55,753 --> 00:30:57,254
Yeah, that's a bad idea.

458
00:30:58,005 --> 00:31:00,165
Yep. Of course.
This is you right here, babe.

459
00:31:05,472 --> 00:31:07,263
No. Hey.

460
00:31:07,264 --> 00:31:08,974
She's off-limits.
No, she's mine.

461
00:31:08,975 --> 00:31:10,058
I see you.

462
00:31:10,059 --> 00:31:12,102
- Hey.
- It's true.

463
00:31:12,519 --> 00:31:13,854
So, we'll just be friends then?

464
00:31:14,313 --> 00:31:15,439
I like it.

465
00:31:18,442 --> 00:31:19,443
Yeah, friends.

466
00:31:23,405 --> 00:31:24,657
- To friendship.
- Yeah.

467
00:31:27,952 --> 00:31:30,078
It's the weekend somewhere.
Let's go.

468
00:31:30,079 --> 00:31:32,331
Oh, no. Please don't leave, sir.
Our Uber's about to leave.

469
00:31:32,332 --> 00:31:33,915
I love you.
I'm gonna head home, honey.

470
00:31:33,916 --> 00:31:35,793
No. no, no. It's brunch in Singapore.
Come on, Lily.

471
00:31:35,794 --> 00:31:37,585
- Let me walk you home.
- No, it's fine.

472
00:31:37,586 --> 00:31:39,505
- I... I live around the corner.
- It's on the way.

473
00:31:39,506 --> 00:31:41,966
- You live where we live.
- Semantics.

474
00:31:41,967 --> 00:31:43,049
Okay, fine, but only 'cause

475
00:31:43,050 --> 00:31:44,884
you'd feel really bad
if I got murdered.

476
00:31:44,885 --> 00:31:46,678
Okay, don't fish
where I swim, Ryle.

477
00:31:46,679 --> 00:31:48,472
I love you.
See you tomorrow, Lil.

478
00:31:49,765 --> 00:31:51,517
I appreciate you walking me,
but you really didn't...

479
00:31:51,518 --> 00:31:53,060
I can't stop thinking about you.

480
00:31:54,186 --> 00:31:55,646
I'm right here.

481
00:31:57,606 --> 00:31:59,567
Well, that's the problem.

482
00:32:01,819 --> 00:32:03,821
I thought we agreed
to be friends.

483
00:32:04,280 --> 00:32:05,281
We did.

484
00:32:06,490 --> 00:32:08,158
But that was, like, hours ago.

485
00:32:11,370 --> 00:32:12,370
Can I just kiss you?

486
00:32:12,371 --> 00:32:15,332
- Oh, my God. You are pushy.
- Just once. Just once.

487
00:32:15,333 --> 00:32:17,042
That's all I need
to get you out of my system.

488
00:32:17,043 --> 00:32:18,752
- Oh, that's it? That'll do it?
- One kiss.

489
00:32:18,753 --> 00:32:20,880
Okay, well, good luck with that.

490
00:32:20,881 --> 00:32:21,964
Is that a yes?

491
00:32:23,757 --> 00:32:24,758
Just once?

492
00:32:25,801 --> 00:32:26,802
Just once.

493
00:32:32,349 --> 00:32:33,350
Okay.

494
00:32:38,188 --> 00:32:39,190
Okay.

495
00:33:01,086 --> 00:33:02,838
Did that get me
out of your system?

496
00:33:05,925 --> 00:33:08,093
I'm gonna walk
myself home, okay?

497
00:33:09,178 --> 00:33:10,179
Bye, friend.

498
00:33:23,651 --> 00:33:25,110
<i>- Is this enough over here?
- Yeah.</i>

499
00:33:25,111 --> 00:33:26,195
Maybe add, like,
a little right there.

500
00:33:26,196 --> 00:33:27,278
Okay.

501
00:33:27,279 --> 00:33:28,882
You're just protecting the roots,
you know, from the snow

502
00:33:28,906 --> 00:33:31,283
or in case it freezes over or anything.

503
00:33:31,784 --> 00:33:34,095
I mean, the roots are the most
important part of the plant.

504
00:33:34,119 --> 00:33:35,538
- Really?
- Yeah.

505
00:33:35,955 --> 00:33:37,706
I didn't know that about roots.
That's cool.

506
00:33:38,791 --> 00:33:40,626
- Here, you want some?
- Oh.

507
00:33:42,461 --> 00:33:44,213
Thank you. Yeah, I'll take that.

508
00:33:44,713 --> 00:33:46,465
What made you wanna
start growing things?

509
00:33:46,882 --> 00:33:49,780
When I take really good care
of these plants,

510
00:33:49,781 --> 00:33:52,689
they reward me
with flowers and vegetables.

511
00:33:52,690 --> 00:33:55,599
And when I don't,
they just shrivel up and die.

512
00:33:56,767 --> 00:33:57,809
Kinda like us.

513
00:34:08,529 --> 00:34:10,029
What about that oak tree?

514
00:34:11,156 --> 00:34:12,741
It doesn't need anybody to grow.

515
00:34:13,366 --> 00:34:15,451
Because it's capable
of taking care of itself.

516
00:34:16,745 --> 00:34:18,622
No matter what,
it will keep standing.

517
00:34:19,331 --> 00:34:20,915
Strong and sturdy...

518
00:34:23,335 --> 00:34:26,505
and yeah, it survives
because it's a goddamn oak tree.

519
00:34:54,783 --> 00:34:56,201
You embarrassed me.

520
00:34:56,826 --> 00:34:59,413
- You like the attention.
- Lily's asleep upstairs.

521
00:35:00,706 --> 00:35:02,394
Honey, please. Please, don't!

522
00:35:04,710 --> 00:35:06,545
I heard what happened
last night...

523
00:35:08,172 --> 00:35:10,424
with your dad and your mom.

524
00:35:13,052 --> 00:35:14,261
I don't... Okay, yeah.

525
00:35:15,512 --> 00:35:16,972
Does that happen a lot?

526
00:35:30,903 --> 00:35:32,196
I'm sorry.

527
00:35:49,171 --> 00:35:50,339
Hey, Lily.

528
00:35:51,298 --> 00:35:52,924
Do you wanna do the honors?

529
00:35:52,925 --> 00:35:55,678
No. You go ahead.
I wanna take it in from here.

530
00:35:56,345 --> 00:35:58,222
I was hoping you'd say that.
Okay.

531
00:36:00,808 --> 00:36:02,517
Okay.

532
00:36:02,518 --> 00:36:04,853
Hold on!

533
00:36:06,355 --> 00:36:08,649
Oh, my God.

534
00:36:09,400 --> 00:36:11,505
- This is insane.
- Congratulations.

535
00:36:11,506 --> 00:36:13,612
I couldn't have
done it without you.

536
00:36:13,613 --> 00:36:14,696
Oh, my gosh.

537
00:36:14,697 --> 00:36:17,241
Oh, I don't know what
I was thinking. Thank God.

538
00:36:17,867 --> 00:36:19,493
Oh, it's incredible.

539
00:36:19,494 --> 00:36:21,119
It's perfect. It's you.

540
00:36:21,120 --> 00:36:22,580
- It's perfect. It's great.
- Oh.

541
00:36:22,581 --> 00:36:24,456
What if we don't
get any customers?

542
00:36:24,457 --> 00:36:26,333
No, don't do that.
Your mom's coming.

543
00:36:26,334 --> 00:36:27,417
Oh, my mom.

544
00:36:27,418 --> 00:36:28,585
She's flying in
to be a customer.

545
00:36:28,586 --> 00:36:30,754
Yeah, I mean... Yeah, but how
depressing would that be

546
00:36:30,755 --> 00:36:32,610
if the only customer
we have is my mom?

547
00:36:32,611 --> 00:36:34,466
Well, Marshall's coming
this afternoon.

548
00:36:34,592 --> 00:36:36,302
So that's two, so you're good.

549
00:36:39,722 --> 00:36:42,141
Okay, here we go.

550
00:36:42,892 --> 00:36:44,559
- Wow.
- Yeah.

551
00:36:44,560 --> 00:36:47,688
This doesn't even look like
the same shop. Congratulations.

552
00:36:47,689 --> 00:36:49,023
How's it going so far?

553
00:36:49,481 --> 00:36:51,608
I mean, we literally
just opened, but...

554
00:36:51,609 --> 00:36:54,715
So, that means your brother's
the first official customer?

555
00:36:54,716 --> 00:36:57,823
Oh, you have to buy something
to be considered a customer.

556
00:36:57,948 --> 00:36:59,783
Right now you're just loitering.

557
00:37:00,451 --> 00:37:01,660
Good morning, Lily.

558
00:37:01,661 --> 00:37:02,912
Good morning.

559
00:37:03,287 --> 00:37:05,706
All right. I'll take these.

560
00:37:06,790 --> 00:37:08,375
Do you, uh, deliver?

561
00:37:08,959 --> 00:37:12,462
- Is that for a girl?
- It is.

562
00:37:12,463 --> 00:37:14,256
She might send them back,
knowing her.

563
00:37:15,424 --> 00:37:17,133
Right. Um, okay.

564
00:37:17,134 --> 00:37:19,177
That little card, fill out
the message on the front

565
00:37:19,178 --> 00:37:21,263
and then the back you put the
person's name and the address.

566
00:37:21,264 --> 00:37:22,388
Okay.

567
00:37:22,389 --> 00:37:23,891
So, are you bringing
this mystery girl

568
00:37:23,892 --> 00:37:25,266
to my birthday party on Friday?

569
00:37:25,267 --> 00:37:28,062
'Cause I kind of, like, need to
plan for that sort of thing.

570
00:37:28,063 --> 00:37:30,356
I don't know.
Are you going, Lily?

571
00:37:31,690 --> 00:37:32,816
Yeah, of course.

572
00:37:32,817 --> 00:37:33,942
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

573
00:37:33,943 --> 00:37:35,819
She has to go.
She's my best friend.

574
00:37:37,821 --> 00:37:39,740
- All right.
- Thank you.

575
00:37:41,659 --> 00:37:44,620
- What do I owe you?
- Oh, um, fifty-one even.

576
00:37:45,454 --> 00:37:46,872
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

577
00:37:46,873 --> 00:37:48,373
- This is a big moment.
- Sure is.

578
00:37:48,374 --> 00:37:51,794
Thank you so much
for your service, uh... business.

579
00:37:53,128 --> 00:37:54,255
Um, thank you. Yeah.

580
00:37:54,547 --> 00:37:56,297
Hey, congrats.

581
00:37:56,298 --> 00:37:58,007
Get out. Thank you.

582
00:37:58,008 --> 00:38:00,177
- Good to see you.
- Bye.

583
00:38:00,178 --> 00:38:01,387
Goodbye.

584
00:38:02,596 --> 00:38:05,848
Oh, my God. He's such a dumbass.

585
00:38:05,849 --> 00:38:10,437
He put the name of our shop
as the delivery address.

586
00:38:11,730 --> 00:38:13,065
Weird first customer.

587
00:38:40,092 --> 00:38:41,092
Oh!

588
00:38:43,345 --> 00:38:44,346
Lily.

589
00:38:45,431 --> 00:38:47,473
- Hello. Happy birthday.
- Oh, my goodness.

590
00:38:47,474 --> 00:38:49,810
- You came. You look great.
- I missed something important.

591
00:38:49,811 --> 00:38:52,229
This is my... It's a long story

592
00:38:52,230 --> 00:38:53,771
Welcome to our casa.

593
00:38:53,772 --> 00:38:55,690
You guys, this...
I mean, your house... This is...

594
00:38:55,691 --> 00:38:58,068
- I can't believe this is your house.
- This is our humble abode.

595
00:38:58,069 --> 00:39:00,446
I just wanted to do something low-key
for baby girl over here.

596
00:39:00,447 --> 00:39:01,530
Oh, my God.

597
00:39:02,406 --> 00:39:04,700
And to think I did not even
marry him for the money.

598
00:39:04,701 --> 00:39:06,285
- You're not in it for the money.
- I'm not.

599
00:39:06,286 --> 00:39:07,660
- You're my ride or die.
- Yeah.

600
00:39:07,661 --> 00:39:10,539
When we first met I was dead broke,
and I was driving a Toyota Camry.

601
00:39:10,540 --> 00:39:12,832
You still drive a Toyota Camry though.
Right?

602
00:39:12,833 --> 00:39:15,211
- The greatest automobile on earth.
- Yes, he does. Also...

603
00:39:15,212 --> 00:39:16,920
Can't convince me otherwise.

604
00:39:16,921 --> 00:39:18,713
He thinks it makes him relatable.

605
00:39:18,714 --> 00:39:21,300
- It really does.
- I'm a man of the people, okay?

606
00:39:21,301 --> 00:39:23,009
Happy birthday.
I'm gonna go grab a drink.

607
00:39:23,010 --> 00:39:24,845
- I'll be right back.
- Okay, thank you. Okay.

608
00:39:25,304 --> 00:39:27,723
Yeah, you are
a man of the people.

609
00:39:39,193 --> 00:39:40,528
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

610
00:39:43,364 --> 00:39:44,698
You didn't like the flowers?

611
00:39:44,699 --> 00:39:46,075
Stop flirting with me.

612
00:39:47,034 --> 00:39:49,245
Hi, may I have a scotch please?
Thank you.

613
00:39:49,954 --> 00:39:51,372
I can't do that.

614
00:39:55,084 --> 00:39:56,377
I thought we were friends.

615
00:39:56,378 --> 00:39:57,461
We are friends.

616
00:40:00,798 --> 00:40:02,048
Okay.

617
00:40:02,049 --> 00:40:04,468
Excuse me. You're on my hand.
Thank you.

618
00:40:17,356 --> 00:40:18,565
- Hi.
- Come on.

619
00:40:18,566 --> 00:40:20,609
- What?
- What are you doing?

620
00:40:22,152 --> 00:40:23,152
Nothing.

621
00:40:23,153 --> 00:40:25,906
You gotta... You gotta stop.
You have to stop this.

622
00:40:27,157 --> 00:40:28,449
- Please.
- What?

623
00:40:28,450 --> 00:40:32,288
Just the, you know, staring at me
like that and the...

624
00:40:32,289 --> 00:40:33,413
I'm just looking at you.

625
00:40:33,414 --> 00:40:35,394
Okay. You're just looking at me.

626
00:40:35,395 --> 00:40:37,375
Stop showing up at my flower shop

627
00:40:37,376 --> 00:40:39,732
- and sending me flowers.
- My sister works there.

628
00:40:39,733 --> 00:40:42,088
Stop walking through this party,
following me around.

629
00:40:42,089 --> 00:40:44,850
- You're making me feel like...
- Can you just shut up for one second?

630
00:40:46,176 --> 00:40:47,177
Okay.

631
00:40:48,470 --> 00:40:49,470
I like you.

632
00:40:49,471 --> 00:40:51,181
What, are you five?

633
00:40:54,685 --> 00:40:56,228
I'm trying here.

634
00:40:57,354 --> 00:40:58,355
Go on.

635
00:41:09,533 --> 00:41:11,452
Do you wanna go
somewhere more private?

636
00:41:13,329 --> 00:41:14,371
To talk?

637
00:41:17,833 --> 00:41:18,876
To talk.

638
00:41:20,085 --> 00:41:21,086
Okay.

639
00:41:40,648 --> 00:41:43,275
No. No, no, no, stop.

640
00:41:44,860 --> 00:41:46,028
You want me to stop?

641
00:41:47,947 --> 00:41:49,907
Mmm, no.

642
00:41:51,367 --> 00:41:52,451
No.

643
00:41:54,078 --> 00:41:57,289
Mmm. But yes. I don't wanna have sex.
Not tonight.

644
00:41:58,583 --> 00:41:59,874
I know, I know.

645
00:41:59,875 --> 00:42:04,171
But I don't do casual,
and I know that's how you do it,

646
00:42:04,172 --> 00:42:07,216
but, um, I've, um, changed my mind.
And I'm sorry.

647
00:42:08,092 --> 00:42:09,677
I can't do this.

648
00:42:18,727 --> 00:42:20,771
You okay? What are you doing?

649
00:42:21,939 --> 00:42:23,398
Getting ready for bed.

650
00:42:23,399 --> 00:42:24,858
We're going to sleep.

651
00:42:24,859 --> 00:42:27,862
Sorry, we're...
We're what?

652
00:42:29,280 --> 00:42:30,364
Going to sleep.

653
00:42:32,324 --> 00:42:33,742
My God.

654
00:42:35,494 --> 00:42:36,495
Do you mind?

655
00:42:41,500 --> 00:42:43,127
Well, do you have something
I can wear?

656
00:43:27,087 --> 00:43:29,215
I don't think you've
ever done this before.

657
00:43:29,216 --> 00:43:30,716
It was sexier in my head.

658
00:43:35,554 --> 00:43:36,555
Pants?

659
00:43:58,077 --> 00:43:59,328
You've got it.

660
00:44:08,337 --> 00:44:09,338
Smart-ass.

661
00:44:22,601 --> 00:44:25,771
Good night, Lily Bloom.

662
00:44:49,336 --> 00:44:52,339
Ryle, I'm very nice,
so I brought you coffee.

663
00:44:52,340 --> 00:44:53,632
Oh!

664
00:44:54,925 --> 00:44:56,594
- Hi.
- No.

665
00:44:57,136 --> 00:44:58,679
Oh, no.

666
00:44:59,513 --> 00:45:00,722
I understand.

667
00:45:00,723 --> 00:45:02,349
- Oh...
- It's not as bad as it looks.

668
00:45:02,350 --> 00:45:04,977
- It looks pretty bad.
- It kind of is.

669
00:45:04,978 --> 00:45:07,605
Okay. None of my business.
Uh, okay.

670
00:45:08,814 --> 00:45:11,025
What... I'm... I'm gonna go.

671
00:45:12,151 --> 00:45:13,694
Let me just say one thing.

672
00:45:14,195 --> 00:45:17,739
This man runs
through women like candy.

673
00:45:17,740 --> 00:45:19,742
- This is different.
- Oh, is it? Wonderful.

674
00:45:19,743 --> 00:45:21,910
Well, just in case it
obviously is not,

675
00:45:21,911 --> 00:45:26,498
let me say that if you're looking for, eh,
nothing from him, that's a great option.

676
00:45:26,499 --> 00:45:27,582
Okay.

677
00:45:27,583 --> 00:45:30,961
But if you're looking for romance
and you want a relationship,

678
00:45:30,962 --> 00:45:33,464
this is not the person,
and it's not about you.

679
00:45:33,465 --> 00:45:34,547
And I love you.

680
00:45:34,548 --> 00:45:35,883
- Yeah.
- But let me just say...

681
00:45:35,884 --> 00:45:36,967
Date me.

682
00:45:38,677 --> 00:45:39,678
What?

683
00:45:40,304 --> 00:45:41,305
Date me.

684
00:45:41,805 --> 00:45:43,015
I've... I don't...

685
00:45:45,851 --> 00:45:47,686
What... What does that mean? I...

686
00:45:47,687 --> 00:45:50,021
Okay, no. I'm gonna leave.

687
00:45:50,022 --> 00:45:54,902
And I'm so sorry,
but I was just bringing coffee,

688
00:45:54,903 --> 00:45:57,862
and now, I'm so embarrassed.

689
00:45:57,863 --> 00:45:59,657
You can't have any of that.

690
00:45:59,658 --> 00:46:01,241
That's for you.

691
00:46:01,242 --> 00:46:02,825
I'm outta here.

692
00:46:02,826 --> 00:46:06,163
A normal person would just leave
and go to therapy.

693
00:46:08,916 --> 00:46:10,793
What are you talking about?

694
00:46:12,003 --> 00:46:13,087
<i>I wanna try.</i>

695
00:46:19,927 --> 00:46:21,428
<i>I wanna try.</i>

696
00:46:25,349 --> 00:46:26,989
<i>Come on.
You think you can do this?</i>

697
00:46:35,109 --> 00:46:36,485
<i>I have no idea.</i>

698
00:46:44,243 --> 00:46:46,120
<i>But I definitely wanna
kiss you again.</i>

699
00:46:47,371 --> 00:46:48,539
<i>Well, that I can do.</i>

700
00:46:52,918 --> 00:46:53,919
<i>Okay.</i>

701
00:46:54,795 --> 00:46:56,422
<i>But don't make me regret this.</i>

702
00:48:31,559 --> 00:48:32,560
Hey.

703
00:48:41,110 --> 00:48:42,111
Good morning.

704
00:48:45,447 --> 00:48:47,783
Mmm, mm-mmm.
You've already brushed your teeth.

705
00:48:47,784 --> 00:48:49,368
That's not fair.

706
00:48:50,703 --> 00:48:52,496
So sorry. I gotta go in early.

707
00:48:52,955 --> 00:48:54,290
Am I gonna see you tonight?

708
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:57,000
Oh.

709
00:48:58,085 --> 00:49:00,670
No. Not tonight. My mom's in town.

710
00:49:00,671 --> 00:49:03,257
She's obsessed with trying
this new restaurant, Root.

711
00:49:03,258 --> 00:49:05,217
It's her dying wish to
take me there.

712
00:49:05,218 --> 00:49:06,427
Your mom's in town?

713
00:49:07,094 --> 00:49:10,597
Yeah. Yeah, no,
she's not actually dying.

714
00:49:10,598 --> 00:49:13,976
- It's... I was just saying that.
- It's just, you didn't, uh...

715
00:49:15,144 --> 00:49:16,145
You didn't tell me that.

716
00:49:17,354 --> 00:49:18,813
Oh, um...

717
00:49:18,814 --> 00:49:21,233
I'm sorry.
I didn't think you'd wanna know.

718
00:49:21,609 --> 00:49:23,527
Is there room for one more?

719
00:49:25,196 --> 00:49:26,864
What?

720
00:49:26,989 --> 00:49:28,741
Wait, you wanna meet my mom?

721
00:49:28,742 --> 00:49:29,824
Is that a problem?

722
00:49:29,825 --> 00:49:32,203
I mean, I don't think
it's a good idea.

723
00:49:32,786 --> 00:49:35,372
- Mm. Ouch.
- No.

724
00:49:35,915 --> 00:49:37,833
No. I mean...

725
00:49:37,834 --> 00:49:39,668
- It's not because of you.
- Mm.

726
00:49:39,669 --> 00:49:41,502
It is because of her.
This woman...

727
00:49:41,503 --> 00:49:44,089
I just wanna meet the mother
of the woman I love.

728
00:50:02,399 --> 00:50:03,566
Hey!

729
00:50:03,567 --> 00:50:07,279
Hey. Sorry, you forgot this. Bye.

730
00:50:08,989 --> 00:50:10,574
Wait, wait, this isn't mine.

731
00:50:11,242 --> 00:50:12,409
I know.

732
00:50:14,578 --> 00:50:16,622
I happen to love you too.

733
00:50:25,047 --> 00:50:26,799
You're gonna be late.

734
00:50:26,800 --> 00:50:29,051
Get over me, my gosh!

735
00:50:29,885 --> 00:50:30,970
I'm taken!

736
00:50:53,325 --> 00:50:54,525
Did you make this?

737
00:50:54,994 --> 00:50:55,995
Yeah.

738
00:50:56,996 --> 00:50:59,331
Carved it from a branch
from your old oak tree.

739
00:51:00,082 --> 00:51:01,417
In case you forget.

740
00:51:03,586 --> 00:51:04,753
Strong and sturdy.

741
00:51:08,215 --> 00:51:09,216
Thank you.

742
00:51:21,729 --> 00:51:24,418
Gross. I bet she has rabies now.

743
00:51:30,029 --> 00:51:31,030
Get up.

744
00:51:32,281 --> 00:51:34,491
- Get up. Get up. Get up.
- Stop. No, no.

745
00:51:35,242 --> 00:51:36,243
Come on.

746
00:51:56,222 --> 00:51:57,223
Do you like to cook?

747
00:51:57,224 --> 00:51:59,057
Yeah. I love it.

748
00:51:59,058 --> 00:52:01,352
Necessity is the mother of invention.

749
00:52:01,353 --> 00:52:02,355
Mmm.

750
00:52:03,103 --> 00:52:04,437
Smells great. What is it?

751
00:52:04,438 --> 00:52:05,772
Hot chocolate cookies.

752
00:52:05,773 --> 00:52:08,192
- Dark chocolate with burnt marshmallows.
- Ooh.

753
00:52:08,984 --> 00:52:09,984
That's good.

754
00:52:09,985 --> 00:52:12,988
My mom would splurge on
Swiss Miss for us at Christmas.

755
00:52:12,989 --> 00:52:14,865
That was her favorite.

756
00:52:21,455 --> 00:52:26,085
So, did you, um, did you kiss me earlier
because you really wanted to,

757
00:52:26,669 --> 00:52:29,672
or was it mostly just to
get back at Katie?

758
00:52:32,550 --> 00:52:33,634
I just...

759
00:52:34,969 --> 00:52:36,971
I really need some clarity here.

760
00:52:45,771 --> 00:52:46,897
I wanted to.

761
00:53:01,662 --> 00:53:02,662
That's my dad.

762
00:53:02,663 --> 00:53:04,122
- That is my dad. You have to go.
- What?

763
00:53:04,123 --> 00:53:06,292
- You... You have to go right now.
- Don't forget the cookies.

764
00:53:06,293 --> 00:53:07,834
Okay. Okay. I got it.
You gotta go right now.

765
00:53:07,835 --> 00:53:09,670
- Out the back door. Please, go.
- Twelve minutes, okay?

766
00:53:09,671 --> 00:53:11,130
- Go, go, go.
- Okay.

767
00:53:16,386 --> 00:53:18,011
- Hey!
- Hi!

768
00:53:18,012 --> 00:53:19,429
- How are you, honey?
- Good.

769
00:53:19,430 --> 00:53:21,265
- You all right? How was your day? Good?
- Yeah.

770
00:53:21,266 --> 00:53:22,348
Yeah, great.

771
00:53:22,349 --> 00:53:23,976
Good. Busy?

772
00:53:23,977 --> 00:53:25,269
Yeah. Um...

773
00:53:26,020 --> 00:53:27,021
Busy's good.

774
00:53:31,609 --> 00:53:32,860
Um, I made cookies.

775
00:53:34,153 --> 00:53:35,153
Yep.

776
00:53:35,154 --> 00:53:36,989
- Yeah, I'm starting to...
- Wow.

777
00:53:37,698 --> 00:53:38,698
Pigs are flying.

778
00:53:38,699 --> 00:53:40,492
Yeah.

779
00:53:41,118 --> 00:53:42,536
Wish I didn't love you so much.

780
00:53:42,537 --> 00:53:44,350
Yeah, same.

781
00:53:44,351 --> 00:53:46,164
Okay. You gonna save me some?

782
00:53:46,165 --> 00:53:47,458
- Yeah, of course.
- You promise?

783
00:53:47,459 --> 00:53:49,001
Yeah, I promise you.

784
00:53:52,630 --> 00:53:54,631
- My goodness.
- Yeah, it's amazing.

785
00:53:54,632 --> 00:53:56,925
- Hi. We're just meeting her.
- Yeah, sure.

786
00:53:56,926 --> 00:53:59,220
- Yeah. I am sorry in advance.
- No.

787
00:53:59,221 --> 00:54:00,471
Yeah, no, no. Prepare yourself.

788
00:54:00,472 --> 00:54:01,555
Hi! Hi, Mama!

789
00:54:01,680 --> 00:54:04,266
- I love this place!
- It's beautiful, right?

790
00:54:04,267 --> 00:54:06,226
Oh, my God! It looks beautiful.

791
00:54:06,227 --> 00:54:08,437
- Let's order cocktails.
- Let's. Yes. Yeah.

792
00:54:08,438 --> 00:54:09,562
- Hi.
- Hi.

793
00:54:09,563 --> 00:54:13,776
Mom, this is... this is my friend, Ryle,
yeah, who I now sleep with. So, ha-ha.

794
00:54:13,777 --> 00:54:14,693
Uh...

795
00:54:14,694 --> 00:54:17,362
- Ryle Kincaid. Nice to meet you, ma'am.
- It's so nice to meet you.

796
00:54:17,363 --> 00:54:20,032
- You know you said that out loud?
- I do know I said that out loud.

797
00:54:20,033 --> 00:54:21,992
- Allysa, you know, who I work with?
- Uh-huh?

798
00:54:21,993 --> 00:54:23,201
This is her brother.

799
00:54:23,202 --> 00:54:26,225
- Oh! Yes! Now I see a resemblance, sure.
- Yeah.

800
00:54:26,226 --> 00:54:29,250
- Well, we both favor our mother.
- Oh, here it goes.

801
00:54:29,251 --> 00:54:31,794
That's what everybody says
about me and Lily.

802
00:54:31,795 --> 00:54:33,462
Oh, you know, I see it.

803
00:54:33,463 --> 00:54:34,546
Oh, yes.

804
00:54:34,547 --> 00:54:37,090
The apple does not fall far
from the tree.

805
00:54:37,091 --> 00:54:39,635
- How lucky are you, Lily?
- The luckiest.

806
00:54:39,636 --> 00:54:41,010
How lucky am I?

807
00:54:41,011 --> 00:54:42,428
Oh, my God.

808
00:54:42,429 --> 00:54:45,849
Would you excuse me? I have a thing.
I like to wash my hands a lot and...

809
00:54:45,850 --> 00:54:47,267
- Give me one...
- Get out of here.

810
00:54:47,268 --> 00:54:50,108
- I will. All right. All right. Bye-bye.
- Leave us be.

811
00:54:52,356 --> 00:54:55,880
- Oh, my God.
- Mom, you know, we don't need to do that.

812
00:54:55,881 --> 00:54:58,852
You never told me you were dating
the most beautiful man.

813
00:54:58,853 --> 00:55:01,824
He's got a good personality
to make up for it, though, so...

814
00:55:01,825 --> 00:55:03,616
Okay. Okay. Okay.

815
00:55:03,617 --> 00:55:04,993
Uh, who is he? Where's he work?

816
00:55:04,994 --> 00:55:06,996
- Don't do that. Don't.
- What does he do? Don't do what?

817
00:55:06,997 --> 00:55:08,998
Hey, I am... I'm your mother.

818
00:55:10,124 --> 00:55:11,166
Boston Grace Hospital.

819
00:55:11,750 --> 00:55:13,167
- Oh, no.
- Stop.

820
00:55:13,168 --> 00:55:14,794
- Welcome to Root.
- No, please, don't.

821
00:55:14,795 --> 00:55:17,464
- Can I get you something to drink?
- God. Please. Thank you. I need alcohol.

822
00:55:17,465 --> 00:55:20,133
Uh, I would like to try a negroni.
I hear they're delicious.

823
00:55:20,134 --> 00:55:22,803
- They are. I'll get you a negroni.
- Thank you.

824
00:55:22,804 --> 00:55:24,263
And what can I get you?

825
00:55:44,033 --> 00:55:45,701
Oh, I'll... Surprise me.

826
00:55:53,417 --> 00:55:54,500
So, what'd I miss?

827
00:55:54,501 --> 00:55:56,419
Are you by any chance
a doctor?

828
00:55:56,420 --> 00:55:59,965
I am. I'm actually gonna be performing
a once-in-a-lifetime operation soon.

829
00:55:59,966 --> 00:56:02,218
Oh, my Lord. Is it dangerous?

830
00:56:02,219 --> 00:56:03,885
It's a risky surgery.

831
00:56:03,886 --> 00:56:06,972
It's amazing though. He's amazing.

832
00:56:06,973 --> 00:56:08,057
They're five years old.

833
00:56:08,058 --> 00:56:09,225
Thank you so much.

834
00:56:17,608 --> 00:56:18,817
So tell me about Boston.

835
00:56:20,110 --> 00:56:21,779
They were
the best years of my life.

836
00:56:23,405 --> 00:56:25,908
- The food is really amazing there...
- Yeah?

837
00:56:25,909 --> 00:56:27,283
...and the harbor.

838
00:56:27,284 --> 00:56:29,662
My uncle would take me
fishing there sometimes.

839
00:56:30,412 --> 00:56:31,622
Sounds like you miss it.

840
00:56:32,331 --> 00:56:33,332
Yeah.

841
00:56:33,916 --> 00:56:35,793
I'm gonna move there
after the Marines.

842
00:56:36,961 --> 00:56:38,546
Everything's better in Boston.

843
00:56:41,340 --> 00:56:42,341
Except the girls.

844
00:56:44,176 --> 00:56:45,511
Boston doesn't have you.

845
00:56:49,848 --> 00:56:51,350
I'm gonna miss you.

846
00:56:54,895 --> 00:56:55,896
Same.

847
00:56:57,565 --> 00:56:59,066
I don't know how you did it.

848
00:57:01,360 --> 00:57:03,445
But somehow,
you became my favorite person.

849
00:57:08,617 --> 00:57:09,618
Same.

850
00:57:29,388 --> 00:57:30,389
Hey.

851
00:57:30,390 --> 00:57:31,472
What?

852
00:57:31,473 --> 00:57:33,370
Are you sure?

853
00:57:33,371 --> 00:57:35,269
Yeah. Yeah.

854
00:57:49,450 --> 00:57:50,951
I don't have a condom.

855
00:57:51,535 --> 00:57:53,412
- I have one.
- You do?

856
00:57:54,580 --> 00:57:55,956
It's health class.

857
00:58:00,711 --> 00:58:03,172
I've... I've never done this before.

858
00:58:03,173 --> 00:58:05,549
- It's okay. I'm no expert.
- Okay.

859
00:58:05,550 --> 00:58:07,927
- I've only done it once.
- Okay.

860
00:58:07,928 --> 00:58:09,511
- Okay.
- Okay.

861
00:58:16,185 --> 00:58:19,021
I've been studying them since they
were born, since I've been a resident...

862
00:58:19,022 --> 00:58:21,002
I'm gonna use the bathroom real quick.

863
00:58:21,003 --> 00:58:22,982
- Okay, honey. Okay.
- Yeah.

864
00:58:22,983 --> 00:58:25,611
You get to know each other.
I'll be right back.

865
00:58:49,176 --> 00:58:50,177
Lily Bloom.

866
00:58:52,555 --> 00:58:53,556
Atlas.

867
00:58:57,184 --> 00:58:58,560
You look...

868
00:58:58,561 --> 00:59:00,646
Yeah, you... You... You...

869
00:59:00,647 --> 00:59:01,938
God, thank you.

870
00:59:01,939 --> 00:59:04,441
I mean,
my mom didn't recognize you, so...

871
00:59:05,150 --> 00:59:08,571
- It's probably for the best.
- God, right? Yeah.

872
00:59:11,156 --> 00:59:12,408
What have you been up to?

873
00:59:13,158 --> 00:59:14,326
Just working. Living.

874
00:59:14,327 --> 00:59:15,410
Yeah, same.

875
00:59:15,411 --> 00:59:18,830
Yeah. Did you go to the military
or what...

876
00:59:18,831 --> 00:59:21,750
Yeah, yeah. No, I did... I did eight...
Yeah, eight years.

877
00:59:21,751 --> 00:59:23,919
- Wow.
- Yeah. I got out and moved to Boston.

878
00:59:25,004 --> 00:59:27,130
What are...

879
00:59:27,131 --> 00:59:29,383
What are...
What are you doing in... in Boston?

880
00:59:29,592 --> 00:59:31,594
Are you... You visiting here, or...

881
00:59:31,595 --> 00:59:32,803
Oh, I live here.

882
00:59:36,181 --> 00:59:38,601
Yeah. Where everything's better.

883
00:59:42,021 --> 00:59:44,522
Is that your... your guy?

884
00:59:44,523 --> 00:59:48,903
Yeah, that's, um... That's Ryle.
He's, yeah, he's, um... he's really special.

885
00:59:48,904 --> 00:59:50,445
I think you'd really like him.

886
00:59:50,446 --> 00:59:52,635
- I'm so happy for you.
- Yeah, thank you.

887
00:59:52,636 --> 00:59:54,824
Do you have anyone,
or are you married?

888
00:59:54,825 --> 00:59:57,828
Or do you have a girlfriend
or, you know, anything?

889
00:59:57,829 --> 00:59:59,496
- Yeah. I got Cassie.
- Yeah?

890
00:59:59,497 --> 01:00:01,165
- Yeah, she's great.
- Oh.

891
01:00:02,374 --> 01:00:03,626
That's so good.

892
01:00:06,003 --> 01:00:07,086
You look so well.

893
01:00:07,087 --> 01:00:09,089
I, um... I don't wanna
get you in trouble or anything.

894
01:00:09,090 --> 01:00:10,549
Well, how do I find you?

895
01:00:11,258 --> 01:00:12,759
- Um...
- If I wanted to find you.

896
01:00:12,760 --> 01:00:15,346
I... I mean, I...
I opened my flower shop.

897
01:00:16,013 --> 01:00:17,264
Lily Bloom's.

898
01:00:18,390 --> 01:00:21,601
- Of course you did.
- Yeah. Over in... in Back Bay.

899
01:00:21,602 --> 01:00:24,813
So, you know,
you can look me up sometime, or...

900
01:00:24,814 --> 01:00:26,065
Um...

901
01:00:28,442 --> 01:00:31,695
- Yeah. Well, I... I gotta... Well, you know.
- Yeah.

902
01:00:31,696 --> 01:00:33,821
- I'm working, so...
- Okay. Get out of here.

903
01:00:33,822 --> 01:00:36,325
- Yeah, I'm gonna go. All right.
- Okay.

904
01:01:09,942 --> 01:01:11,735
- ...once-in-a-lifetime operation.
- Lily?

905
01:01:11,736 --> 01:01:13,028
What are you drinking?

906
01:01:13,029 --> 01:01:14,320
I'll have wine, please.

907
01:01:14,321 --> 01:01:16,114
You are not getting wine.
You're in a onesie.

908
01:01:16,115 --> 01:01:17,950
- You don't get free wine with a onesie.
- Fair point.

909
01:01:17,951 --> 01:01:19,869
- Whatever you're having, I'll have it.
- Bingo!

910
01:01:19,870 --> 01:01:21,662
Three beers and
a water for my ladylove.

911
01:01:21,663 --> 01:01:23,455
Wait, did you just say "water"?

912
01:01:26,458 --> 01:01:27,459
I'm sorry.

913
01:01:27,626 --> 01:01:28,751
Okay, yeah.

914
01:01:28,752 --> 01:01:30,462
We didn't plan on
telling you here...

915
01:01:30,463 --> 01:01:31,754
Stop it.

916
01:01:31,755 --> 01:01:33,923
Um, you know.

917
01:01:33,924 --> 01:01:35,885
I'm gonna be a dad!

918
01:01:38,470 --> 01:01:40,190
- And I'm gonna be the mom.
- Yes!

919
01:01:40,639 --> 01:01:42,786
I'm gonna be a dad!

920
01:01:42,787 --> 01:01:44,934
- I knew it.
- No, no.

921
01:01:44,935 --> 01:01:46,936
This is fucking crazy! I know!

922
01:01:46,937 --> 01:01:49,148
- I'm so happy for you. I'm so happy.
- Yeah.

923
01:01:50,816 --> 01:01:52,985
- I'm a papa.
- I'm just so happy for you.

924
01:01:52,986 --> 01:01:54,361
You're gonna be the best mama.

925
01:01:54,362 --> 01:01:55,486
Oh, my God.

926
01:01:55,487 --> 01:01:57,614
To Allysa,
who's 11 months younger than me,

927
01:01:57,615 --> 01:02:00,326
and you still teach me every day
what being a grown-up looks like.

928
01:02:00,327 --> 01:02:01,410
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

929
01:02:01,411 --> 01:02:02,493
Cheers.

930
01:02:02,494 --> 01:02:04,997
Eleven months? You guys,
I didn't know you were so close in age.

931
01:02:04,998 --> 01:02:07,374
Oh, yeah. Three kids in three years.

932
01:02:07,375 --> 01:02:09,021
Makes you feel bad for our mom.

933
01:02:09,022 --> 01:02:10,669
Three? You guys have a sibling?

934
01:02:13,756 --> 01:02:17,718
Yeah. Yeah,
we had an older brother, Emerson.

935
01:02:18,385 --> 01:02:19,802
Um...

936
01:02:19,803 --> 01:02:21,513
And he died when we were younger.

937
01:02:26,143 --> 01:02:27,810
Oh, I'm so sorry.

938
01:02:27,811 --> 01:02:30,689
- Let's go. Goal!
- Yeah!

939
01:02:51,293 --> 01:02:52,294
Good morning.

940
01:02:53,671 --> 01:02:54,734
You like frittata?

941
01:02:54,735 --> 01:02:55,798
What is happening?

942
01:02:56,340 --> 01:02:59,552
No, no, I feel like I'm in a porno.
What... What is this?

943
01:03:00,719 --> 01:03:02,346
I did not know you could cook.

944
01:03:03,222 --> 01:03:04,222
I can't.

945
01:03:04,223 --> 01:03:07,226
Oh, well, good, 'cause I was
starting to get a little intimidated.

946
01:03:07,227 --> 01:03:09,103
It was, you know,
a little too good to be true.

947
01:03:09,104 --> 01:03:10,980
- That's for you. Yeah.
- That's mine. Thank you.

948
01:03:11,772 --> 01:03:14,525
I like a little hair of the dog.
Don't be shy.

949
01:03:15,359 --> 01:03:16,568
It's actually, uh...

950
01:03:16,569 --> 01:03:19,572
This is just to celebrate
my big surgery tomorrow.

951
01:03:22,783 --> 01:03:23,784
Oh, my God, I'm...

952
01:03:24,577 --> 01:03:25,660
- I'm so sorry.
- No, no, no.

953
01:03:25,661 --> 01:03:28,163
- I don't know what I was thinking. I...
- It's fine.

954
01:03:28,998 --> 01:03:30,331
It's not fine. I'm sorry.

955
01:03:30,332 --> 01:03:33,085
- Hey. I am sorry.
- Hey, what's that mean? The heart.

956
01:03:33,919 --> 01:03:36,629
Oh, God, it's nothing. I just...

957
01:03:36,630 --> 01:03:38,590
You know, one of those
silly things you do.

958
01:03:38,591 --> 01:03:41,635
No, it's not nothing.
Every tattoo means something.

959
01:03:41,636 --> 01:03:43,136
Oh, I know. No, no.

960
01:03:43,137 --> 01:03:45,723
This is just like one of those
silly things you do in high school,

961
01:03:45,724 --> 01:03:47,892
and I don't know why I still have it.

962
01:03:50,519 --> 01:03:51,520
No.

963
01:03:52,938 --> 01:03:54,565
It's one of
my favorite parts of you.

964
01:03:56,066 --> 01:03:57,109
Mmm.

965
01:03:57,985 --> 01:04:01,196
- Okay. Baby?
- Mm?

966
01:04:01,197 --> 01:04:03,240
- I have to tell you something.
- Hmm.

967
01:04:03,241 --> 01:04:04,658
Your frittata's burning.

968
01:04:05,576 --> 01:04:06,619
Shh.

969
01:04:07,620 --> 01:04:08,746
It's gonna be perfect.

970
01:04:08,747 --> 01:04:09,830
Okay.

971
01:04:10,831 --> 01:04:13,626
Well, what are some of your
other favorite parts about me?

972
01:04:22,551 --> 01:04:24,323
Your glabella.

973
01:04:24,324 --> 01:04:26,096
Mmm. Mm-hmm.

974
01:04:30,476 --> 01:04:33,040
- Your flagina.
- Oh, no! Stop!

975
01:04:37,483 --> 01:04:40,319
- Oh, shit!
- I told you. I'm sorry. I did tell you.

976
01:04:41,362 --> 01:04:43,781
- No, no. Baby, you need a potholder.
- Oh, my God! Shit!

977
01:04:43,782 --> 01:04:45,678
You're gonna
stick your hand in there?

978
01:04:56,210 --> 01:04:57,294
Hey, baby.

979
01:05:00,714 --> 01:05:02,967
- Hey, hey. You're okay.
- What was that?

980
01:05:02,968 --> 01:05:04,884
What was that? No, no.

981
01:05:04,885 --> 01:05:05,885
Can you give me a second,
please?

982
01:05:05,886 --> 01:05:06,886
Hey. Hey.

983
01:05:06,887 --> 01:05:08,472
- Just give me a second.
- Oh, shit!

984
01:05:09,014 --> 01:05:10,473
Are you okay? I'm sorry.

985
01:05:10,474 --> 01:05:13,060
- Oh, my God. Your hand.
- No, don't worry about my hand.

986
01:05:13,727 --> 01:05:15,229
Baby, your surgery.

987
01:05:17,439 --> 01:05:18,774
You okay?

988
01:05:19,024 --> 01:05:20,776
I think so. I don't know.

989
01:05:21,569 --> 01:05:22,736
Let me see it.

990
01:05:24,113 --> 01:05:26,156
- Shit, I'm...
- I know. I'm hurt.

991
01:05:26,157 --> 01:05:27,741
I knew we'd make a mess.

992
01:05:28,659 --> 01:05:30,410
- I'm so sorry.
- It was an accident.

993
01:05:30,411 --> 01:05:33,205
No. I didn't... I didn't... I didn't...

994
01:05:33,206 --> 01:05:35,082
- What did we do?
- It was an accident.

995
01:05:38,294 --> 01:05:40,296
I'm okay.

996
01:05:42,381 --> 01:05:44,048
- God, I'm so sorry.
- Hey.

997
01:05:44,049 --> 01:05:46,217
- Thank you for coming. Sorry I'm late.
- Stop.

998
01:05:46,218 --> 01:05:48,387
- I'm a disaster.
- No, here. I think I got everything.

999
01:05:48,388 --> 01:05:50,389
Yeah, no, no, thank you. Okay.

1000
01:05:50,390 --> 01:05:51,639
How was the wedding?

1001
01:05:51,640 --> 01:05:53,808
- Also a disaster.
- No.

1002
01:05:53,809 --> 01:05:56,604
- It's fine. It's fine. It was a little, just...
- How's a wedding a disaster?

1003
01:05:56,605 --> 01:05:59,732
Well, I mean, their marriage is
probably the disaster, but they're fine.

1004
01:05:59,733 --> 01:06:02,860
- They're lovely. They deserve each other.
- But the flowers were beautiful?

1005
01:06:02,861 --> 01:06:04,486
Yes, the flowers were off the char...

1006
01:06:04,487 --> 01:06:07,322
I'm so sorry. How was your...

1007
01:06:07,323 --> 01:06:10,075
How was your surgery?
How did your sweet hand hold up?

1008
01:06:10,534 --> 01:06:12,119
- It was awesome.
- Really?

1009
01:06:12,120 --> 01:06:13,453
- Yeah.
- Really?

1010
01:06:13,454 --> 01:06:15,956
Yeah. There was this moment, um...

1011
01:06:17,249 --> 01:06:19,543
Allysa and Marshall messed up.

1012
01:06:19,544 --> 01:06:20,960
We're going to Root.

1013
01:06:20,961 --> 01:06:23,047
The place we went to
with your mom. Um...

1014
01:06:23,547 --> 01:06:26,675
- There was this moment, and I...
- Well, hold... Why? Why?

1015
01:06:26,676 --> 01:06:27,759
I don't know.

1016
01:06:27,760 --> 01:06:29,802
I know, but I was dying
to try the new place...

1017
01:06:29,803 --> 01:06:31,638
- Yeah, but they heard...
- ...and we've already been there.

1018
01:06:31,639 --> 01:06:34,099
- ...how we talked about it and...
- Yeah, but we could just call them.

1019
01:06:34,100 --> 01:06:35,516
- No. They're already there.
- No, I know.

1020
01:06:35,517 --> 01:06:37,060
- They ordered 14 appetizers.
- I really wanted to...

1021
01:06:37,061 --> 01:06:39,103
- You know my sister.
- ...try the new place. I know. I'm sorry.

1022
01:06:39,104 --> 01:06:41,857
- I will take you there next week.
- You know I love food. That's all.

1023
01:06:41,858 --> 01:06:43,442
- You know I'm a creature of habit.
- That's all it is.

1024
01:06:43,443 --> 01:06:44,943
- I'll get the same thing I got last time.
- Okay.

1025
01:06:44,944 --> 01:06:47,544
Yeah, I mean, it's perfect.
The food... The food is so good, so...

1026
01:06:50,157 --> 01:06:51,492
Hey. Hey.

1027
01:06:52,159 --> 01:06:53,202
What?

1028
01:06:53,536 --> 01:06:54,537
- Hi.
- Hi.

1029
01:06:55,454 --> 01:06:57,706
I'm sorry. It's been a...
It's been a week. Um...

1030
01:06:58,624 --> 01:07:01,418
I don't need to be complaining to you.
You've been through it. Um...

1031
01:07:01,919 --> 01:07:02,920
Yeah.

1032
01:07:03,921 --> 01:07:05,256
Tell me. I wanna hear everything.

1033
01:07:05,257 --> 01:07:06,674
- Okay.
- Okay.

1034
01:07:07,800 --> 01:07:08,800
Hmm.

1035
01:07:18,060 --> 01:07:20,521
- Hi. Sorry.
- Hey, hey, hey.

1036
01:07:20,522 --> 01:07:21,646
- Hey.
- Hi!

1037
01:07:21,647 --> 01:07:22,940
- What's up?
- I'm so sorry we're late.

1038
01:07:22,941 --> 01:07:24,399
Just sit down. Don't worry about it.

1039
01:07:24,400 --> 01:07:25,692
- Can I have this?
- Oh, yeah. Of course.

1040
01:07:25,693 --> 01:07:28,445
- We've ordered so much food.
- We're so sorry.

1041
01:07:28,446 --> 01:07:29,822
- Yeah, it's... it's my fault.
- Oh, baby.

1042
01:07:29,823 --> 01:07:31,155
I didn't...

1043
01:07:31,156 --> 01:07:32,824
Ryle told me something happened,

1044
01:07:32,825 --> 01:07:35,077
but he didn't tell me
it was looking like this.

1045
01:07:35,078 --> 01:07:36,452
Look at you, honey.

1046
01:07:36,453 --> 01:07:37,621
- It's fine. It doesn't even...
- Yeah.

1047
01:07:37,622 --> 01:07:38,705
It doesn't even hurt.

1048
01:07:38,706 --> 01:07:40,353
It was a mess.
You should have seen her.

1049
01:07:40,354 --> 01:07:42,000
Yeah. I mean, his hand.
And he got hurt too.

1050
01:07:42,001 --> 01:07:44,502
- So we're... Yeah. We are.
- Yeah. No, I'm fine.

1051
01:07:44,503 --> 01:07:48,841
- I feel bad. It was... It was a beautiful mess.
- Yeah.

1052
01:07:49,842 --> 01:07:52,082
Wait, so, dude,
what happened with the surgery?

1053
01:07:52,595 --> 01:07:54,638
Probably the greatest day of my life.

1054
01:07:54,639 --> 01:07:56,848
Twenty-seven hours.

1055
01:07:56,849 --> 01:07:58,516
- Twenty-seven hours?
- Yeah.

1056
01:07:58,517 --> 01:08:01,228
The only thing I've done for 27 hours
is day-trade and play Call of Duty.

1057
01:08:01,229 --> 01:08:02,562
Do you guys have baby names?

1058
01:08:02,563 --> 01:08:05,683
- Sorry, I didn't mean to interrupt.
- And go on a DraftKings bender.

1059
01:08:05,983 --> 01:08:08,611
- Baby names?
- Yeah, sorry. I was, yeah, thinking.

1060
01:08:08,612 --> 01:08:10,696
We're thinking something strong.

1061
01:08:11,280 --> 01:08:13,324
- We're gonna do big-time authors.
- This riff...

1062
01:08:13,325 --> 01:08:15,284
R. L. Stine.

1063
01:08:15,285 --> 01:08:16,366
Judy Blume.

1064
01:08:16,367 --> 01:08:18,077
That is going to be
the demise of our marriage.

1065
01:08:18,078 --> 01:08:19,286
- How we doing, folks?
- Hi.

1066
01:08:19,287 --> 01:08:21,496
- How are you liking your appetizers?
- Oh, wonderful.

1067
01:08:21,497 --> 01:08:24,167
I've had one bite of one thing and this is
already my favorite restaurant.

1068
01:08:24,168 --> 01:08:26,545
- What'd you go for?
- The Brussels sprouts.

1069
01:08:26,546 --> 01:08:28,004
Ah, Brussels sprouts.

1070
01:08:28,005 --> 01:08:29,756
What about you? What do you like?

1071
01:08:30,341 --> 01:08:32,635
Oh, I'm... Impossible to choose.

1072
01:08:32,636 --> 01:08:34,384
Uh, my regards to the chef.

1073
01:08:34,385 --> 01:08:36,972
Thank you. Appreciate it.
It's actually my mother's recipe.

1074
01:08:36,973 --> 01:08:38,723
- Oh.
- That's very beautiful.

1075
01:08:38,724 --> 01:08:41,309
- It's my first restaurant. Yeah.
- Love that.

1076
01:08:41,310 --> 01:08:43,186
And I love the creativity,
dude, seriously.

1077
01:08:43,187 --> 01:08:45,063
- So...
- I'm an entrepreneur as well, so I get it.

1078
01:08:45,064 --> 01:08:46,813
What's... What's your...
What's your deal? What's your thing?

1079
01:08:46,814 --> 01:08:50,486
Right now we're looking to allocate
capital in local Boston businesses,

1080
01:08:50,487 --> 01:08:52,238
and a place like this
would just be amazing.

1081
01:08:53,198 --> 01:08:55,616
Not to be too forward,
but what are margins right now?

1082
01:08:55,617 --> 01:08:58,743
I mean, the place is jumping.
Thirteen, 14, 15 percent?

1083
01:08:58,744 --> 01:09:00,703
But I love the story about your mom.

1084
01:09:00,704 --> 01:09:03,707
You do a Series A
and scale this thing up.

1085
01:09:05,876 --> 01:09:07,676
- Honey.
- Did I offend him?

1086
01:09:08,379 --> 01:09:11,464
No, just keep saying "allocating capital."

1087
01:09:11,465 --> 01:09:13,341
- The chef was the asshole.
- I have been holding it for so long.

1088
01:09:13,342 --> 01:09:15,322
I'm gonna go pee really quick.
I'll be right back.

1089
01:09:15,323 --> 01:09:17,084
- Do you want me to come?
- No, I'm good. I'm good.

1090
01:09:17,085 --> 01:09:18,847
- Are you...
- No, no, you... You guys keep talking.

1091
01:09:18,848 --> 01:09:19,974
I'll be right back.

1092
01:09:31,609 --> 01:09:33,821
- Come on.
- What happened?

1093
01:09:36,657 --> 01:09:37,949
Come on, tell me. What happened?

1094
01:09:37,950 --> 01:09:40,952
Nothing. I... We... I...
He burned his hand, and I fell.

1095
01:09:41,871 --> 01:09:44,665
I know. I know. It's...
It was an accident, though. It was...

1096
01:09:44,666 --> 01:09:46,625
- That was an accident?
- Yes. Shh.

1097
01:09:51,338 --> 01:09:52,339
Leave him.

1098
01:09:54,008 --> 01:09:55,508
- God.
- You gotta leave him.

1099
01:09:55,509 --> 01:09:58,304
- I am not your mother, Atlas.
- Leave him. Come on.

1100
01:10:00,222 --> 01:10:01,515
Are you turning into yours?

1101
01:10:06,061 --> 01:10:07,396
- Let me out of here.
- Lily.

1102
01:10:09,773 --> 01:10:11,275
- Let me out now.
- Lily.

1103
01:10:11,276 --> 01:10:12,359
Stop.

1104
01:10:17,323 --> 01:10:18,324
Wait, what is this?

1105
01:10:19,575 --> 01:10:20,575
Atlas! Stop.

1106
01:10:20,576 --> 01:10:23,204
Touch her again, I'll cut your hand off
and shove it down your throat,

1107
01:10:23,205 --> 01:10:25,873
- you piece of shit.
- Atlas, stop! Stop.

1108
01:10:26,874 --> 01:10:28,459
- Stop.
- Oh.

1109
01:10:29,168 --> 01:10:30,502
So this is Atlas.

1110
01:10:31,003 --> 01:10:32,337
- Baby, hey.
- The homeless boy...

1111
01:10:32,338 --> 01:10:34,506
- Come on. Stop.
- ...you wasted your virginity on?

1112
01:10:37,426 --> 01:10:40,678
Guys, stop it! Stop it!

1113
01:10:40,679 --> 01:10:43,515
- Please! Please stop it. Stop!
- Hey! Break it up.

1114
01:10:43,516 --> 01:10:45,225
- No! Please.
- Come on.

1115
01:10:45,226 --> 01:10:47,769
- Please, stop. No!
- Get out of my restaurant!

1116
01:10:47,770 --> 01:10:51,190
- Stop! Let's get out of here.
- Get out of my restaurant!

1117
01:10:51,191 --> 01:10:53,359
- Stop, please, please. Let's go.
- Come on.

1118
01:10:53,360 --> 01:10:55,611
- Get out!
- Stop it, now!

1119
01:10:59,532 --> 01:11:00,657
Ryle?

1120
01:11:00,658 --> 01:11:01,992
Excuse me. Ryle.

1121
01:11:04,328 --> 01:11:06,371
Ryle. Ryle, wait.

1122
01:11:06,372 --> 01:11:08,874
- Ryle, please, wait.
- What was he doing in the bathroom, Lily?

1123
01:11:08,875 --> 01:11:10,124
What was he doing in the bathroom?

1124
01:11:10,125 --> 01:11:11,960
He saw my eye,
and I think he saw your hand.

1125
01:11:11,961 --> 01:11:14,630
And he knows it was an accident.
And I told him it was an accident. He...

1126
01:11:14,631 --> 01:11:17,633
Lily.

1127
01:11:19,677 --> 01:11:20,678
What?

1128
01:11:24,515 --> 01:11:25,515
I don't...

1129
01:11:25,516 --> 01:11:26,809
I don't know him.

1130
01:11:27,393 --> 01:11:28,810
I mean, we... we... We were kids.

1131
01:11:28,811 --> 01:11:30,411
- I don't know him now.
- Anyone but him.

1132
01:11:32,106 --> 01:11:33,274
Anyone but him.

1133
01:11:34,483 --> 01:11:36,819
- I don't know what you're talking about.
- I know you. Anyone but him.

1134
01:11:42,283 --> 01:11:43,492
Promise me.

1135
01:11:45,077 --> 01:11:46,161
Okay.

1136
01:11:46,704 --> 01:11:48,038
- Okay?
- Okay.

1137
01:11:49,248 --> 01:11:50,332
Yeah.

1138
01:11:50,624 --> 01:11:51,792
I don't know.

1139
01:11:53,669 --> 01:11:54,670
Okay.

1140
01:11:55,546 --> 01:11:57,171
Okay, okay, okay.

1141
01:11:57,172 --> 01:11:58,924
I've never been here before.

1142
01:12:02,386 --> 01:12:05,847
- You have me. You have all of me.
- I know. I know. I know.

1143
01:12:05,848 --> 01:12:08,517
- So, if I'm not what you want, you just...
- No, no, no. I'm fine.

1144
01:12:08,518 --> 01:12:10,102
Stop. Stop. Stop.

1145
01:12:10,936 --> 01:12:12,438
Stop. Stop. Stop.

1146
01:12:12,938 --> 01:12:14,773
Stop. Stop.

1147
01:12:15,608 --> 01:12:17,776
- Stop.
- I love you, Lily.

1148
01:12:17,777 --> 01:12:19,945
I know. I know. I know. I know.

1149
01:12:20,613 --> 01:12:21,947
I know.

1150
01:12:23,532 --> 01:12:24,617
I love you, Lily.

1151
01:12:27,286 --> 01:12:28,454
I love you, too.

1152
01:12:37,171 --> 01:12:39,590
No, please stop. No, please, please.

1153
01:12:39,591 --> 01:12:41,800
Lily! Open the door.

1154
01:12:42,384 --> 01:12:43,761
- You gotta leave right now.
- Lily!

1155
01:12:43,762 --> 01:12:45,220
- I'm coming!
- Open the door!

1156
01:12:45,221 --> 01:12:47,348
- Leave right now. Put your clothes on.
- Who's in there?

1157
01:12:47,349 --> 01:12:49,141
- He's coming. Come on.
- Hey! Open...

1158
01:13:24,635 --> 01:13:26,720
- Thank you. Enjoy.
- Thank you for coming by.

1159
01:13:26,721 --> 01:13:27,805
We appreciate it.

1160
01:13:28,556 --> 01:13:29,764
- Bye.
- Thank you.

1161
01:13:29,765 --> 01:13:31,120
Thanks so much for stopping in.

1162
01:13:31,121 --> 01:13:32,476
- It's busy.
- Yeah.

1163
01:13:35,771 --> 01:13:37,648
Whoo, I think that's the last of it.

1164
01:13:38,023 --> 01:13:39,024
How you doing, mama?

1165
01:13:39,025 --> 01:13:40,693
I'm doing.

1166
01:13:42,319 --> 01:13:44,280
- I'm doing.
- You in that little dress.

1167
01:13:44,281 --> 01:13:45,364
Do you mind if I...

1168
01:13:46,198 --> 01:13:49,076
- If I see the baby for a moment?
- Oh, yeah. Have a visit.

1169
01:13:49,077 --> 01:13:51,579
Hi, bubba. How you doing?
You getting big.

1170
01:13:52,079 --> 01:13:53,080
Hey, question.

1171
01:13:53,873 --> 01:13:57,001
If, um, we're not allowed
to go back to that restaurant...

1172
01:13:57,002 --> 01:13:58,084
Yeah.

1173
01:13:58,085 --> 01:14:01,422
...why is he allowed to
come to this store?

1174
01:14:07,219 --> 01:14:08,553
- I don't...
- Coffee.

1175
01:14:08,554 --> 01:14:11,473
- Okay.
- I'm getting coffee. Would you like some?

1176
01:14:12,224 --> 01:14:14,017
No, I'm good. Thank you.

1177
01:14:14,018 --> 01:14:16,478
- Excuse me. Hi. Hey. Excuse me.
- Hi.

1178
01:14:17,438 --> 01:14:18,479
Thank you.

1179
01:14:18,480 --> 01:14:20,149
- Nice to see you.
- Yeah.

1180
01:14:23,527 --> 01:14:24,528
Hi.

1181
01:14:25,863 --> 01:14:26,864
Hi.

1182
01:14:27,656 --> 01:14:29,658
This is incredible.

1183
01:14:29,950 --> 01:14:31,034
Yeah, thanks.

1184
01:14:31,035 --> 01:14:33,454
Kind of exactly, uh, how I imagined it.

1185
01:14:36,081 --> 01:14:37,082
Yeah, yours too.

1186
01:14:38,292 --> 01:14:39,293
Thanks.

1187
01:14:40,794 --> 01:14:41,879
Look at us.

1188
01:14:45,090 --> 01:14:46,342
So, look, I, uh...

1189
01:14:49,053 --> 01:14:51,138
I came by the next day after the fight,

1190
01:14:53,057 --> 01:14:56,602
but he was here. And I... I just didn't think
that was a good idea.

1191
01:14:58,479 --> 01:15:00,523
I just... I just wanted to say
I'm really sorry.

1192
01:15:00,524 --> 01:15:03,358
- I was out of my mind...
- Yeah.

1193
01:15:03,359 --> 01:15:05,193
...and... and acted like a jackass and...

1194
01:15:05,194 --> 01:15:07,028
I just feel really bad and I'm sorry.

1195
01:15:07,029 --> 01:15:09,031
Yeah, yeah. No, it's all good. It's, um...

1196
01:15:09,740 --> 01:15:11,866
Yeah. It was a misunderstanding. So...

1197
01:15:11,867 --> 01:15:14,620
Well, I don't... I don't know.
I mean, no, it wasn't.

1198
01:15:15,120 --> 01:15:16,288
I don't think it was.

1199
01:15:21,418 --> 01:15:23,921
Why are you here now?
I gave you my address months ago.

1200
01:15:23,922 --> 01:15:25,297
What are you... What are you doing?

1201
01:15:25,298 --> 01:15:26,632
I came the next day.

1202
01:15:33,722 --> 01:15:36,475
I drive this street a lot.

1203
01:15:44,859 --> 01:15:45,860
Yeah.

1204
01:15:52,157 --> 01:15:53,576
I'm sorry.

1205
01:15:57,621 --> 01:15:58,789
Are you happy?

1206
01:16:01,750 --> 01:16:02,793
Yeah.

1207
01:16:04,670 --> 01:16:06,088
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

1208
01:16:06,755 --> 01:16:08,173
I couldn't be happier.

1209
01:16:10,467 --> 01:16:11,468
Are you?

1210
01:16:15,055 --> 01:16:16,181
No.

1211
01:16:21,312 --> 01:16:22,396
Sorry.

1212
01:16:35,534 --> 01:16:36,702
That your phone?

1213
01:16:36,703 --> 01:16:37,786
Yeah.

1214
01:16:40,497 --> 01:16:41,498
What are you doing?

1215
01:16:47,129 --> 01:16:49,798
That's my number. In case you need it.

1216
01:16:53,552 --> 01:16:55,387
Okay, well, I won't, so...

1217
01:16:56,472 --> 01:16:57,639
But thank you.

1218
01:16:57,640 --> 01:16:58,807
I hope you don't.

1219
01:17:08,609 --> 01:17:09,860
Hey, that, um...

1220
01:17:10,694 --> 01:17:12,488
That thing that he said about that...

1221
01:17:12,489 --> 01:17:14,240
You know, with us. It wasn't...

1222
01:17:15,491 --> 01:17:16,492
<i>It wasn't wasted.</i>

1223
01:17:17,660 --> 01:17:19,036
I know.

1224
01:17:21,288 --> 01:17:22,289
I was there.

1225
01:17:37,972 --> 01:17:38,973
Hi.

1226
01:17:44,520 --> 01:17:45,938
- Hey.
- Hey.

1227
01:17:49,066 --> 01:17:51,734
Mmm.

1228
01:17:51,735 --> 01:17:53,404
That smells good.

1229
01:17:53,405 --> 01:17:54,572
Thank you.

1230
01:17:59,159 --> 01:18:00,536
Are you happy?

1231
01:18:03,414 --> 01:18:04,414
Um...

1232
01:18:06,041 --> 01:18:07,126
Are you okay?

1233
01:18:08,252 --> 01:18:09,503
Yeah. I'm just...

1234
01:18:10,129 --> 01:18:11,547
I'm just curious.

1235
01:18:16,302 --> 01:18:17,469
I wasn't.

1236
01:18:19,722 --> 01:18:21,348
Lily, you make me happy.

1237
01:18:22,850 --> 01:18:23,851
Are you happy?

1238
01:18:25,102 --> 01:18:29,398
I mean, I don't think anyone's
happy all the time, but, um...

1239
01:18:29,399 --> 01:18:31,233
I don't know if I like the sound of that.

1240
01:18:31,234 --> 01:18:32,859
No, no. It's just, you know...

1241
01:18:32,860 --> 01:18:36,321
Of course I deal with, um,
you know, my stuff

1242
01:18:36,322 --> 01:18:39,783
and, you know...
...life, and ticking clock

1243
01:18:39,784 --> 01:18:43,245
- and, you know, all those decisions that...
- Right.

1244
01:18:43,246 --> 01:18:45,538
...that women have to worry about.

1245
01:18:45,539 --> 01:18:48,208
But, I think I'm an innately happy person.

1246
01:18:48,209 --> 01:18:53,172
It's probably just a coping mechanism
I learned from my mom. So...

1247
01:18:53,173 --> 01:18:54,256
Your mom?

1248
01:18:57,593 --> 01:18:59,345
My dad used to hit her.

1249
01:19:09,188 --> 01:19:11,023
Shit, I'm so sorry.

1250
01:19:12,399 --> 01:19:13,734
You never told me that.

1251
01:19:15,319 --> 01:19:17,404
That's not something people talk about.

1252
01:19:18,739 --> 01:19:20,157
Did he ever hurt you?

1253
01:19:21,492 --> 01:19:24,119
No. He nearly killed Atlas though.

1254
01:19:29,833 --> 01:19:31,585
Oh, my God. I'm so sorry.

1255
01:19:32,461 --> 01:19:33,462
Oh...

1256
01:19:36,173 --> 01:19:37,633
Oh, God.

1257
01:19:40,010 --> 01:19:41,512
I'm so embarrassed. I...

1258
01:19:42,596 --> 01:19:44,348
That mess at the restaurant.

1259
01:19:46,559 --> 01:19:48,644
I didn't know.
That must have been so hard on you.

1260
01:19:48,645 --> 01:19:49,728
Yeah.

1261
01:19:50,938 --> 01:19:53,023
Baby, all I wanna do in my life
is protect you.

1262
01:19:53,024 --> 01:19:54,191
You know that, right?

1263
01:19:54,859 --> 01:19:57,111
When you hurt yourself by accident,

1264
01:19:58,445 --> 01:20:00,154
when you stub your toe, I blame myself.

1265
01:20:00,155 --> 01:20:03,701
It's like it's my fault
that the wall was there.

1266
01:20:03,702 --> 01:20:04,784
Stop.

1267
01:20:04,785 --> 01:20:07,246
I'm the luckiest goddamn man
on this planet.

1268
01:20:09,957 --> 01:20:12,125
And I could clean up. Trust me.

1269
01:20:12,126 --> 01:20:13,960
Okay. I'm not trying to hear about that.

1270
01:20:13,961 --> 01:20:16,881
- You don't wanna hear about that? Just a little bit?
- No. No.

1271
01:20:17,673 --> 01:20:19,924
Yeah, I'm a ripped neurosurgeon
for Christ's sake.

1272
01:20:19,925 --> 01:20:21,802
When was the last time
you saw someone who looked like me

1273
01:20:21,803 --> 01:20:23,595
that wasn't on a daytime soap?

1274
01:20:23,596 --> 01:20:26,473
I mean, come to think of it,
yeah, I... No, I haven't.

1275
01:20:26,474 --> 01:20:28,579
- Yeah.
- And I'm rich.

1276
01:20:28,580 --> 01:20:30,686
Oh, and humble.

1277
01:20:32,187 --> 01:20:33,606
We can work on that.

1278
01:20:34,565 --> 01:20:35,983
God, I love you.

1279
01:20:36,567 --> 01:20:39,570
I know. I love you, too.
That's the problem.

1280
01:20:41,530 --> 01:20:42,970
<i>- It's a big problem.
- Mm-hmm.</i>

1281
01:20:44,033 --> 01:20:45,873
<i>- It's a really big problem.
- Mmm.</i>

1282
01:21:05,054 --> 01:21:07,431
Stop.

1283
01:21:15,773 --> 01:21:17,775
Look at her. She's like a little alien.

1284
01:21:18,400 --> 01:21:20,945
Yeah, she's perfect.

1285
01:21:25,074 --> 01:21:26,200
Do you want to hold her?

1286
01:21:28,494 --> 01:21:30,621
- Yeah.
- I knew it.

1287
01:21:30,622 --> 01:21:31,851
Here you go.

1288
01:21:31,852 --> 01:21:33,082
Okay.

1289
01:21:34,959 --> 01:21:37,586
- Hi.
- There we go. Right there.

1290
01:21:37,711 --> 01:21:41,298
- Oh, you're so beautiful. Hi.
- Oh, wow.

1291
01:21:41,299 --> 01:21:42,591
You're a mama.

1292
01:21:42,592 --> 01:21:43,883
Yeah.

1293
01:21:43,884 --> 01:21:45,760
Oh, my sister's a mama.

1294
01:21:45,761 --> 01:21:47,179
And you're an uncle.

1295
01:21:53,018 --> 01:21:55,145
Wow. You did it.

1296
01:21:56,939 --> 01:21:59,275
This is just hormones.
Don't look at me.

1297
01:22:00,234 --> 01:22:02,110
Do you guys want kids? Well...

1298
01:22:02,111 --> 01:22:04,738
No pressure. We're not...
Not putting you on the spot right now.

1299
01:22:04,739 --> 01:22:07,658
I mean, it would be great
for childcare and stuff like that.

1300
01:22:08,993 --> 01:22:11,370
I'm not gonna make her
put on a white dress

1301
01:22:11,371 --> 01:22:12,788
and have my babies.

1302
01:22:14,039 --> 01:22:15,666
Unless she wants to.

1303
01:22:17,376 --> 01:22:19,003
Then I would marry her tonight.

1304
01:22:24,633 --> 01:22:26,718
- Oh, shit. He's serious.
- Oh, my gosh.

1305
01:22:26,719 --> 01:22:28,804
Ryle, you are...
You're drunk on baby smell.

1306
01:22:28,805 --> 01:22:30,680
No, no, no. I am serious as an aneurysm.

1307
01:22:30,681 --> 01:22:33,517
Oh, God. Please don't do
neurosurgeon humor when you're propos...

1308
01:22:33,518 --> 01:22:34,747
I mean, if you are.

1309
01:22:34,748 --> 01:22:35,977
Is that... Is this...

1310
01:22:35,978 --> 01:22:37,813
- He's going around.
- I mean, if that's what you...

1311
01:22:37,814 --> 01:22:39,481
- Give me the baby.
- This is out of it...

1312
01:22:39,482 --> 01:22:41,128
- Please stop.
- Yeah. Wait.

1313
01:22:41,129 --> 01:22:42,775
No, no. No, no, stop.

1314
01:22:42,776 --> 01:22:44,945
- Oh, he's doing it?
- Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

1315
01:22:44,946 --> 01:22:46,592
Okay. Okay. What...

1316
01:22:47,980 --> 01:22:49,366
Can we just...

1317
01:22:50,075 --> 01:22:51,701
Can you get the baby?
We have a baby.

1318
01:22:51,702 --> 01:22:52,995
- We can take that. That's ours.
- Give me.

1319
01:22:52,996 --> 01:22:54,704
- Here you go.
- Here you go, baby. Shh.

1320
01:22:54,705 --> 01:22:57,666
You get back down there.
You get back down there right this second.

1321
01:23:04,590 --> 01:23:06,425
Will you marry me, Lily Blossom Bloom?

1322
01:23:09,845 --> 01:23:10,845
Yeah?

1323
01:23:10,846 --> 01:23:12,013
Okay.

1324
01:23:12,014 --> 01:23:14,767
- This is just... I'm just...
- He did it.

1325
01:23:14,768 --> 01:23:16,352
This is a miracle.

1326
01:23:17,186 --> 01:23:18,187
Oh, thank God.

1327
01:23:19,021 --> 01:23:20,356
Oh, my God.

1328
01:23:29,615 --> 01:23:32,326
- But we'll do a proper wedding one day.
<i>- You got married without me.</i>

1329
01:23:32,327 --> 01:23:34,702
And I continue to be very sorry,

1330
01:23:34,703 --> 01:23:36,580
but at some point
you're gonna have to forgive me.

1331
01:23:36,581 --> 01:23:37,997
I will wear you down.

1332
01:23:37,998 --> 01:23:39,916
- My wife will wear you down.
<i>- Not possible.</i>

1333
01:23:39,917 --> 01:23:42,126
I don't think you should ever forgive her.
Just saying.

1334
01:23:42,127 --> 01:23:44,671
Okay. That's enough of that.
Hold on, can you charge my phone?

1335
01:23:44,672 --> 01:23:47,466
<i>I haven't been dreaming about
your wedding day your whole life,</i>

1336
01:23:47,467 --> 01:23:49,489
<i>I've been dreaming about it my whole life.</i>

1337
01:23:49,490 --> 01:23:51,511
<i>And I'm sorry, I just feel cheated.</i>

1338
01:23:51,512 --> 01:23:54,723
Yeah, okay. Got it. Thanks, Mom.
Okay, we're gonna find a way to move on.

1339
01:23:54,724 --> 01:23:56,933
<i>If I don't get to watch you
walk down the aisle,</i>

1340
01:23:56,934 --> 01:23:59,143
<i>I will not be denied
watching you squirm.</i>

1341
01:23:59,144 --> 01:24:01,479
<i>- You wanna make it up to me?</i>
- Yes, please.

1342
01:24:01,480 --> 01:24:04,900
<i>Make me a grandbaby. No, three. Three.
Make it triplets.</i>

1343
01:24:04,901 --> 01:24:05,817
All right,
can you just...

1344
01:24:05,818 --> 01:24:08,498
Can we move past this conversation, please?

1345
01:24:10,489 --> 01:24:11,490
You okay?

1346
01:24:12,700 --> 01:24:13,701
<i>What happened?</i>

1347
01:24:14,243 --> 01:24:16,120
- Mom, I'll call you right back, okay?
<i>- Okay.</i>

1348
01:24:16,121 --> 01:24:17,913
Yeah, no, hang up.

1349
01:24:20,249 --> 01:24:21,417
Hey, what happened?

1350
01:24:26,463 --> 01:24:27,631
Hey, you okay?

1351
01:24:34,388 --> 01:24:35,806
I dropped your phone,

1352
01:24:38,183 --> 01:24:39,810
and the case fell off.

1353
01:24:51,071 --> 01:24:52,323
And I found this.

1354
01:24:58,829 --> 01:25:00,247
I called the number...

1355
01:25:11,383 --> 01:25:13,302
- It wasn't...
- You promised me.

1356
01:25:14,053 --> 01:25:15,888
- I know.
- I would never lie to you.

1357
01:25:15,889 --> 01:25:17,577
I know. It's nothing.

1358
01:25:17,578 --> 01:25:19,266
- It's nothing?
- Yeah.

1359
01:25:19,808 --> 01:25:20,935
Yeah.

1360
01:25:21,101 --> 01:25:23,771
- It's nothing?
- Yes. Yes, I promise.

1361
01:25:24,521 --> 01:25:25,814
Yeah.

1362
01:25:28,651 --> 01:25:29,652
Okay?

1363
01:25:38,035 --> 01:25:39,036
It's nothing.

1364
01:25:40,037 --> 01:25:42,289
- Okay.
- Okay.

1365
01:25:50,297 --> 01:25:51,298
Ryle.

1366
01:25:52,049 --> 01:25:54,718
Ryle, baby, I promise
I didn't mean to see him.

1367
01:25:54,719 --> 01:25:56,511
- I promise. Please.
- Stop! No, no, no.

1368
01:25:56,512 --> 01:25:58,284
- No. I promise, please.
- Lily, stop!

1369
01:25:58,285 --> 01:26:00,056
No, it's...
Please, just listen to me.

1370
01:26:00,057 --> 01:26:02,518
- Please. I didn't know he was coming.
- You promised me, Lily. Stop.

1371
01:26:02,519 --> 01:26:04,270
- Just talk to me. Please. Just...
- Stop!

1372
01:26:04,271 --> 01:26:06,397
- You stop. Please. Don't...
- Stop!

1373
01:26:11,110 --> 01:26:12,735
Hey. Shh...

1374
01:26:12,736 --> 01:26:14,738
Hey. Just try to be still.

1375
01:26:15,739 --> 01:26:16,740
Just try to be still.

1376
01:26:20,744 --> 01:26:22,246
It's all done. Shh. I'm here.

1377
01:26:22,247 --> 01:26:23,497
- Stop.
- I'm here.

1378
01:26:24,248 --> 01:26:25,331
Hey.

1379
01:26:25,332 --> 01:26:28,002
What... What happened?

1380
01:26:29,003 --> 01:26:30,754
You fell down the stairs.

1381
01:26:32,923 --> 01:26:34,842
No, no, no. Don't... Don't touch it.

1382
01:26:35,718 --> 01:26:37,595
Yeah, you tripped and...

1383
01:26:38,137 --> 01:26:40,805
And I, um... I...
I tried to catch you.

1384
01:26:40,806 --> 01:26:43,434
- No, Ryle, no.
- You're... You're okay. You're okay.

1385
01:26:46,357 --> 01:26:47,520
- Don't.
- It hurts.

1386
01:26:47,521 --> 01:26:49,023
I know it hurts. You're okay.

1387
01:26:49,024 --> 01:26:50,608
- Okay.
- You're okay.

1388
01:26:53,194 --> 01:26:54,528
Do you know who you are?

1389
01:26:55,446 --> 01:26:56,779
Lily Bloom.

1390
01:26:56,780 --> 01:26:58,157
Okay. Where are you?

1391
01:26:59,200 --> 01:27:00,951
- Our apartment.
- Okay. Who am I?

1392
01:27:02,536 --> 01:27:03,871
My husband.

1393
01:27:05,456 --> 01:27:06,916
And what am I doing right now?

1394
01:27:08,209 --> 01:27:09,543
Helping me.

1395
01:27:12,463 --> 01:27:14,215
How many fingers am I holding up?

1396
01:27:16,550 --> 01:27:17,550
- Five.
- Five.

1397
01:27:17,551 --> 01:27:19,637
- And now? Okay.
- Two.

1398
01:27:20,221 --> 01:27:21,639
Tell me it's nothing.

1399
01:27:25,643 --> 01:27:26,936
It's nothing.

1400
01:27:28,854 --> 01:27:29,897
Yeah, come.

1401
01:27:30,981 --> 01:27:32,983
Thank you.

1402
01:27:37,656 --> 01:27:38,738
Am I okay?

1403
01:27:38,739 --> 01:27:40,324
You're okay. You're okay.

1404
01:27:40,950 --> 01:27:42,034
Okay.

1405
01:28:32,960 --> 01:28:34,377
Lily! Oh, my God.

1406
01:28:34,378 --> 01:28:36,714
Did you see it? Did you see the magazine?

1407
01:28:36,715 --> 01:28:38,506
You did it! Look at this!

1408
01:28:38,507 --> 01:28:40,341
Top ten. We're in the top ten!

1409
01:28:40,342 --> 01:28:42,615
- We're in the top... You did it.
- Wait, where is it?

1410
01:28:42,616 --> 01:28:44,889
Where's the genius? Right there.
Look, look, look.

1411
01:28:44,890 --> 01:28:46,223
- Right there. There's you!
- Oh, my God.

1412
01:28:46,224 --> 01:28:47,891
Oh, my God. I'm gonna call Ryle

1413
01:28:47,892 --> 01:28:50,644
and then tell him
to get, like, 50 copies of this thing.

1414
01:29:21,050 --> 01:29:22,051
Hey.

1415
01:29:23,010 --> 01:29:24,011
Hey.

1416
01:29:31,685 --> 01:29:32,686
You saw?

1417
01:29:34,355 --> 01:29:36,272
- Congratulations.
- Yeah, thank you.

1418
01:29:36,273 --> 01:29:39,777
I didn't know it was a big deal,
"Best in Boston."

1419
01:29:39,778 --> 01:29:41,195
Best in Boston.

1420
01:29:46,784 --> 01:29:49,662
Oh. Hello.

1421
01:29:50,996 --> 01:29:52,164
Okay.

1422
01:29:55,125 --> 01:29:57,920
Mmm. I love this tattoo.

1423
01:29:59,588 --> 01:30:01,257
Hey, remind me what that means again.

1424
01:30:03,384 --> 01:30:04,885
Um, what?

1425
01:30:06,345 --> 01:30:07,680
I told you.

1426
01:30:08,639 --> 01:30:10,140
Really doesn't mean anything?

1427
01:30:14,144 --> 01:30:15,396
Did you read it yet?

1428
01:30:16,730 --> 01:30:18,774
- Yeah, did you?
- Mm-hmm.

1429
01:30:19,775 --> 01:30:21,277
Mm. Will you read it to me?

1430
01:30:21,944 --> 01:30:23,862
- I don't like that kinda stuff.
- Please.

1431
01:30:23,863 --> 01:30:26,928
No. Baby, I made dinner,
and it's gonna get cold.

1432
01:30:26,929 --> 01:30:29,994
- Read it.
- And I don't love this kinda stuff, okay?

1433
01:30:34,206 --> 01:30:35,373
"Number seven, Lily Bloom's.

1434
01:30:35,374 --> 01:30:38,836
- An avant-garde floral shop... "What?
- No, no. Skip to number one.

"The top pick should
come as no surprise..."

1439

"The owner, Atlas Corrigan,

1441
01:31:07,281 --> 01:31:10,868

his farm-to-table hot spot, Root.

When I was a kid, I carved a..."

1443

- Carved what?
- Baby, I don't wanna read...

1444
01:31:19,336 --> 01:31:20,419
Keep reading.

1445
01:31:25,257 --> 01:31:27,550
"...small hollow heart
from an oak tree for a girl.

1446
01:31:27,551 --> 01:31:29,970
So the name was meant to represent
something she said to me,

1447
01:31:29,971 --> 01:31:31,846
which I'm gonna keep between us.

1448
01:31:31,847 --> 01:31:34,516
But there was no other name for Root.
It was...

1449
01:31:35,893 --> 01:31:36,894
always for her."

Baby...

1451
01:31:39,104 --> 01:31:40,940
Just go to this last paragraph.

1452
01:31:41,524 --> 01:31:42,691
It gets better.

1453
01:31:45,903 --> 01:31:47,743

"When asked if he had seen the girl
since they were kids,

1455

- Corrigan replied..."

'Yes. Next question.'"

1457

Do you love him?

1458
01:32:13,889 --> 01:32:14,889
I did.

1459
01:32:14,890 --> 01:32:15,975
Do you love him now?

1460
01:32:16,684 --> 01:32:17,684
I love you.

1461
01:32:17,685 --> 01:32:19,186
That wasn't my question.

I don't know.

1463

Thank you.

- You want me to stop?
- Not now. Hey, stop it.

- Mmh-mmh.
- Stop it.

- Hey.
- Stop.

Stop it.

Stop! Stop. Hey!

1478
01:33:38,682 --> 01:33:40,350
Don't. Stop. Stop. Hey.

1479
01:33:40,351 --> 01:33:42,852
- What are you doing? Stop. Stop.
- Hey.

1480
01:33:42,853 --> 01:33:44,897
- What are you doing? What are you doing?
- Shh. Shh.

1481
01:33:44,898 --> 01:33:47,191
- Baby. Hey.
- Stop. Stop.

01:33:48,985 --> 01:33:50,069
Hey.

1483
01:33:51,403 --> 01:33:52,530
I love you.

1484
01:33:54,949 --> 01:33:57,076
I just haven't shown you
how much I love you.

1485
01:33:57,077 --> 01:33:58,285
You have.

1486
01:33:58,994 --> 01:34:00,329
- You have.
- No.

1487
01:34:00,955 --> 01:34:02,623
You have.

- Baby...
- Please.

01:34:04,166 --> 01:34:06,126
You have, baby. You have.

1490
01:34:06,335 --> 01:34:07,461
Okay.

1491
01:34:12,967 --> 01:34:15,261
Okay. Okay.

1492
01:34:18,222 --> 01:34:20,349
- I love you so much.
- I love you, baby.

1493
01:34:20,933 --> 01:34:22,293
- I love you.
- I love you so much.

1494
01:34:22,935 --> 01:34:25,813
Baby. Baby, please stop.

1495
01:34:25,938 --> 01:34:27,313
Please stop.

01:34:27,314 --> 01:34:30,484
Please. Hey. Hey, stop. Stop.

1497
01:34:30,485 --> 01:34:32,068
Hey. Stop. Look at me.

1498
01:34:32,069 --> 01:34:34,738
- I love you so much.
- Look at me. No, no. Look at me.

1499
01:34:34,739 --> 01:34:37,116
And I want you to know
that I love you enough.

1500
01:34:37,117 --> 01:34:38,783
- You have. Hey. Hey.
- No.

1501
01:34:38,784 --> 01:34:40,639
Look at me. Look at me. I love you.

1502
01:34:40,640 --> 01:34:42,485
Baby, look at me. Please look at me.

1503
01:34:42,486 --> 01:34:44,330
- Please look at me.
- That tattoo.

1504
01:34:44,331 --> 01:34:47,167
Please look at me.
Please look at me. Please.

1505
01:34:47,168 --> 01:34:49,086
Please. Please. I love you.

1506
01:34:49,087 --> 01:34:50,963
I love you. I love you. Please.

1507
01:34:50,964 --> 01:34:52,839
<i>Please, don't do this.</i>

1508
01:34:52,840 --> 01:34:54,550
<i>Please. Please. Please.</i>

1509
01:34:54,675 --> 01:34:56,071
Stop! Stop!

1510
01:35:20,409 --> 01:35:22,369
I don't think I'm showing you
how much I love you.

1511
01:35:23,120 --> 01:35:25,164
<i>- Yes, you have.
- No.</i>

1512
01:35:25,165 --> 01:35:26,373
<i>No, I haven't.</i>

1513
01:35:43,849 --> 01:35:45,517
- Hands.
- Yes, chef.

1514
01:36:29,436 --> 01:36:31,355
I was never gonna become her.

1515
01:36:33,899 --> 01:36:35,401
You're not becoming her.

1516
01:36:36,402 --> 01:36:37,862
Don't even think about that.

1517
01:36:39,280 --> 01:36:40,281
Okay?

1518
01:36:41,448 --> 01:36:43,492
- Yeah.
- You're not.

1519
01:36:55,004 --> 01:36:56,338
Is that what I think it is?

1520
01:37:00,009 --> 01:37:01,093
Yeah.

1521
01:37:06,557 --> 01:37:09,184
I wanna tell you something.
I don't know if it's the right time...

1522
01:37:09,310 --> 01:37:10,603
Sorry for the delay.

1523
01:37:11,729 --> 01:37:13,355
Been really busy tonight.

1524
01:37:14,732 --> 01:37:17,568
So, we have a certain examination
for these situations.

1525
01:37:17,735 --> 01:37:21,572
It's called the SANE exam.
It's completely optional, of course...

1526
01:37:22,907 --> 01:37:24,241
He didn't...

1527
01:37:25,743 --> 01:37:26,869
No, I wasn't... It's...

1528
01:37:26,870 --> 01:37:27,953
Did he try?

1529
01:37:29,330 --> 01:37:31,749
I don't need the exam. Thank you. Yeah.

1530
01:37:33,459 --> 01:37:34,459
May I?

1531
01:37:34,460 --> 01:37:36,378
Oh, yeah. Of course.

1532
01:37:41,091 --> 01:37:42,731
- Does this hurt?
- Mmh-mmh.

1533
01:37:43,719 --> 01:37:45,366
- This?
- Mmh-mmh.

1534
01:37:45,367 --> 01:37:47,014
No, it's just the skin. Yeah.

1535
01:37:47,264 --> 01:37:48,599
So, usually,

1536
01:37:49,475 --> 01:37:52,978
I'd give you an X-ray on this collarbone
to make sure that it isn't fractured,

1537
01:37:52,979 --> 01:37:56,314
but, given your situation,
we're gonna clean it up,

1538
01:37:56,315 --> 01:37:59,235
and the nurse is gonna come in
and give you a tetanus shot.

1539
01:38:00,152 --> 01:38:02,153
I... I don't understand.

1540
01:38:02,154 --> 01:38:05,241
We don't give X-rays to pregnant women
unless it's vital.

1541
01:38:05,866 --> 01:38:06,867
Okay?

1542
01:38:10,329 --> 01:38:11,329
Yeah.

1543
01:38:11,330 --> 01:38:12,414
- Right. I'll be right back.
- Okay.

1544
01:38:12,415 --> 01:38:13,499
Okay.

1545
01:38:35,020 --> 01:38:37,064
There's no Cassie, is there?

1546
01:38:37,773 --> 01:38:38,774
No.

1547
01:38:41,277 --> 01:38:42,361
No, there isn't.

1548
01:38:45,990 --> 01:38:47,157
It's, uh...

1549
01:38:48,075 --> 01:38:49,159
It's the place.

1550
01:38:54,832 --> 01:38:57,668
Um, kitchen, living room.

1551
01:38:58,752 --> 01:39:00,921
Uh, hey, let me grab you some clothes.

1552
01:39:11,265 --> 01:39:12,265
Thank you.

1553
01:39:12,266 --> 01:39:14,018
My dad won't even notice they're gone.

1554
01:39:16,103 --> 01:39:17,103
Um...

1555
01:39:18,105 --> 01:39:19,355
Bedroom's all yours.

1556
01:39:19,356 --> 01:39:21,400
- No, I'm not gonna take your bedroom.
- No. Please.

1557
01:39:21,401 --> 01:39:23,402
I have to get up early
for work anyway, so...

1558
01:39:24,111 --> 01:39:26,405
I love that couch. It's a good couch.

1559
01:39:27,406 --> 01:39:29,491
So, stay as long as you want.

1560
01:39:30,201 --> 01:39:31,327
Thank you.

1561
01:39:31,619 --> 01:39:32,995
Okay. Now, get some rest.

1562
01:39:35,331 --> 01:39:36,373
See you tomorrow.

1563
01:40:43,023 --> 01:40:44,066
Hey.

1564
01:40:44,733 --> 01:40:45,734
Hi.

1565
01:40:52,366 --> 01:40:56,829
I wasn't sure if you were hungry,
so I went with a few fan favorites.

1566
01:41:03,377 --> 01:41:05,212
What song do you want at your funeral?

1567
01:41:08,632 --> 01:41:09,800
If you had to pick one.

1568
01:41:10,718 --> 01:41:11,968
Have you not thought about this?

1569
01:41:11,969 --> 01:41:13,637
What song you're gonna play at my funeral?

1570
01:41:13,638 --> 01:41:14,721
Yeah.

1571
01:41:14,722 --> 01:41:19,518
At my funeral,
I'm thinking Creed, "With Arms Wide Open".

1572
01:41:19,519 --> 01:41:21,312
- You know, <i>"With arms wide..."</i>
- Yeah.

1573
01:41:21,313 --> 01:41:23,022
...as the casket's being lowered.

1574
01:41:33,866 --> 01:41:35,159
You're gonna be okay.

1575
01:41:38,996 --> 01:41:40,497
It doesn't feel like it.

1576
01:41:41,498 --> 01:41:42,499
I know.

1577
01:41:43,667 --> 01:41:44,752
But you are.

1578
01:41:46,170 --> 01:41:48,839
I think it's a little different this time.

1579
01:41:52,676 --> 01:41:54,469
If I can't even take care of myself,

1580
01:41:54,470 --> 01:41:59,558
then how am I, um, you know,
supposed to take care of a baby?

1581
01:42:15,282 --> 01:42:16,824
That night I went
to that old abandoned house,

1582
01:42:16,825 --> 01:42:19,411
I didn't go there because
I needed a place to stay,

1583
01:42:19,912 --> 01:42:21,497
I went there to kill myself.

1584
01:42:24,416 --> 01:42:26,502
And I was sitting
on the living room floor,

1585
01:42:26,503 --> 01:42:28,837
and I saw you in your bedroom window.

1586
01:42:28,838 --> 01:42:30,005
The light came on,

1587
01:42:30,756 --> 01:42:33,508
and you poked your head
through that curtain,

1588
01:42:33,509 --> 01:42:36,262
and as soon as I saw your face,
I couldn't do it.

1589
01:42:37,888 --> 01:42:40,307
The next day, you brought me food,
you fed me...

1590
01:42:47,523 --> 01:42:48,607
I mean, you saved...

1591
01:42:50,442 --> 01:42:53,487
You saved my life
is what I'm trying to say.

1592
01:42:55,281 --> 01:42:56,365
That's who you are.

1593
01:42:57,241 --> 01:43:00,243
And if you decide to keep it...

1594
01:43:00,244 --> 01:43:03,247
...you are going to be an amazing mother.

1595
01:43:05,457 --> 01:43:07,918
And that baby is so lucky.

1596
01:43:13,507 --> 01:43:14,550
You've got this.

1597
01:43:41,869 --> 01:43:42,953
Lily.

1598
01:44:18,280 --> 01:44:20,407
If you ever find yourself in the position
to love somebody again,

1599
01:44:20,408 --> 01:44:21,909
just fall in love with me.

1600
01:44:29,124 --> 01:44:30,960
Yeah. Okay.

1601
01:45:07,329 --> 01:45:08,831
I'm so sorry.

1602
01:45:11,584 --> 01:45:16,672
I've been watching him my entire life,
and I've seen...

1603
01:45:18,924 --> 01:45:24,680
how afraid he is
of opening his heart to anyone,

1604
01:45:26,765 --> 01:45:28,434
ever since he was a kid.

1605
01:45:30,394 --> 01:45:34,732
And I think I felt
that he was dying inside.

1606
01:45:36,775 --> 01:45:39,361
Just dying inside, little by little,

1607
01:45:41,238 --> 01:45:42,740
until he met you.

1608
01:45:45,492 --> 01:45:48,245
And I'm not making any excuses, uh...

1609
01:45:50,080 --> 01:45:51,081
I never...

1610
01:45:52,082 --> 01:45:54,668
I never thought he was capable of this.

1611
01:45:58,714 --> 01:45:59,714
Um...

1612
01:46:01,759 --> 01:46:05,804
Would it... Would it be okay
if I asked what happened to Emerson?

1613
01:46:07,097 --> 01:46:08,265
Of course.

1614
01:46:11,685 --> 01:46:14,104
You deserve to know, and it's our family.

1615
01:46:17,024 --> 01:46:18,024
Um...

1616
01:46:21,570 --> 01:46:23,239
My father had a gun.

1617
01:46:24,740 --> 01:46:28,244
Ryle and Emerson were
playing in the house,

1618
01:46:28,827 --> 01:46:31,413
you know, pretending to be cowboys,

1619
01:46:32,581 --> 01:46:33,624
and they found it.

1620
01:46:35,251 --> 01:46:37,253
And Ryle was six-years-old.

1621
01:46:37,920 --> 01:46:39,964
He was a six-year-old boy.

1622
01:46:43,008 --> 01:46:45,155
He didn't even know
that it was a real gun.

1623
01:46:45,156 --> 01:46:47,304
He thought that it was pretend...

1624
01:46:48,514 --> 01:46:51,684
...until it was too late.

1625
01:46:55,271 --> 01:46:57,106
- Emerson was our brother...
- I'm so sorry.

1626
01:46:57,107 --> 01:46:58,858
...his best friend.

1627
01:47:02,027 --> 01:47:03,779
He's never been the same since.

1628
01:47:03,780 --> 01:47:04,864
Yeah.

1629
01:47:07,449 --> 01:47:09,535
To be at that funeral...

1630
01:47:19,086 --> 01:47:21,922
I really did used to love flowers.

1631
01:47:24,216 --> 01:47:25,551
Listen to me.

1632
01:47:26,343 --> 01:47:28,052
As his sister,

1633
01:47:28,053 --> 01:47:32,308
I wish more than anything
that you could find a way to forgive him.

1634
01:47:35,060 --> 01:47:37,062
But, as your best friend,

1635
01:47:38,564 --> 01:47:43,235
Lily, if you take him back,
I will never speak to you again.

1636
01:47:49,533 --> 01:47:50,826
I'm so sorry.

1637
01:47:51,869 --> 01:47:54,205
You're the best friend I ever had.

1638
01:47:55,206 --> 01:47:56,832
I'll be an even better auntie.

1639
01:48:02,129 --> 01:48:03,255
Sweetheart.

1640
01:48:46,340 --> 01:48:47,924
- This side?
- That side.

1641
01:48:47,925 --> 01:48:50,594
Yeah, if I hold it in like this,
I think it'll be a little easier.

1642
01:48:50,595 --> 01:48:53,222
- Righty tighty, I think.
- Yep. Come on.

1643
01:48:53,223 --> 01:48:54,305
I'm sorry.

1644
01:48:54,306 --> 01:48:55,390
No, no. You got it.

1645
01:48:55,391 --> 01:48:57,517
Your dad always did this stuff.

1646
01:48:57,518 --> 01:48:59,728
Oh, I'm sure you built a thing or two
in your life.

1647
01:48:59,729 --> 01:49:02,690
No. No, no. That was always his domain.

1648
01:49:06,151 --> 01:49:08,320
It doesn't wanna go in there.

1649
01:49:09,572 --> 01:49:10,573
Um...

1650
01:49:14,076 --> 01:49:15,703
Why did you stay with him?

1651
01:49:23,919 --> 01:49:26,005
It would've been harder to leave.

1652
01:49:30,551 --> 01:49:31,802
And I loved him.

1653
01:49:32,845 --> 01:49:34,972
Yeah, me, too.

1654
01:49:37,224 --> 01:49:38,517
I think I got it.

1655
01:49:40,185 --> 01:49:43,564
And that's the heartbeat.

1656
01:49:43,565 --> 01:49:46,859
- Mmm.
- Look at that. Do you wanna know?

1657
01:49:46,860 --> 01:49:49,111
- You can tell already?
- I can.

1658
01:49:52,907 --> 01:49:54,282
Okay.

1659
01:49:54,283 --> 01:49:55,659
Yeah.

1660
01:49:56,869 --> 01:49:58,495
- Yeah. Yeah.
- Yeah?

1661
01:49:58,496 --> 01:49:59,580
Okay.

1662
01:50:01,457 --> 01:50:02,708
Can you see that?

1663
01:50:03,334 --> 01:50:04,877
That's her little head.

1664
01:50:09,173 --> 01:50:10,299
Oh.

1665
01:50:11,759 --> 01:50:12,843
Hi.

1666
01:50:13,719 --> 01:50:15,346
Hi, baby girl.

1667
01:50:16,597 --> 01:50:18,641
"Her," huh?

1668
01:50:23,020 --> 01:50:24,188
Hi.

1669
01:50:25,940 --> 01:50:27,691
Hi, my baby girl.

1670
01:50:52,758 --> 01:50:53,842
Hi.

1671
01:51:06,146 --> 01:51:07,273
It's always...

1672
01:51:11,193 --> 01:51:12,194
Oh. Thank you.

1673
01:51:24,456 --> 01:51:25,624
Is she kicking?

1674
01:51:26,250 --> 01:51:28,586
Oh, yeah. Yeah.

1675
01:51:34,091 --> 01:51:35,301
All right.

1676
01:51:36,051 --> 01:51:37,260
Sturdy.

1677
01:51:37,261 --> 01:51:39,513
- Here you go. Grab this side.
- All right.

1678
01:51:41,348 --> 01:51:42,349
Thank you.

1679
01:51:43,684 --> 01:51:45,561
I can clean all this up, so...

1680
01:51:45,562 --> 01:51:46,729
Okay.

1681
01:52:02,286 --> 01:52:06,332
Do you wanna feel, before you go?
If you want?

1682
01:52:09,210 --> 01:52:10,210
Is she kicking now?

1683
01:52:10,211 --> 01:52:13,005
Always. Yeah.

1684
01:52:13,839 --> 01:52:15,110
Uh, yes.

1685
01:52:15,111 --> 01:52:16,383
Yeah. Okay.

1686
01:52:18,302 --> 01:52:20,095
Yeah, go ahead. Yeah.

1687
01:52:22,973 --> 01:52:24,266
Here. Here.

1688
01:52:26,685 --> 01:52:27,686
There she is.

1689
01:52:27,687 --> 01:52:28,771
Yeah.

1690
01:52:29,772 --> 01:52:33,817
Big old noggin. You feel that?
That's her little heel. You feel that?

1691
01:52:34,944 --> 01:52:37,446
She's kinda stretching. Yeah.

1692
01:52:45,037 --> 01:52:46,205
Come home.

1693
01:52:49,250 --> 01:52:50,793
Look, I won't...

1694
01:52:51,418 --> 01:52:53,212
It will never happen again.

1695
01:52:54,046 --> 01:52:56,215
I promise. I will... I will get help.

1696
01:52:58,884 --> 01:53:00,052
Please come home.

1697
01:53:08,978 --> 01:53:10,980
- I'm s...
- You're gonna be late for work.

1698
01:54:21,508 --> 01:54:24,094
Come. You wanna join us?

1699
01:54:27,556 --> 01:54:29,225
Got room for one more.

1700
01:54:30,517 --> 01:54:31,894
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

1701
01:54:33,270 --> 01:54:37,983
I know. I got you. I got you.

1702
01:54:39,360 --> 01:54:41,153
- Hey.
- Wanna hold her?

1703
01:54:43,239 --> 01:54:44,239
Yeah.

1704
01:54:44,240 --> 01:54:48,244
- Here you go. Like that.
- Hey. Hi.

1705
01:54:48,911 --> 01:54:50,203
Mommy's got you.

1706
01:54:50,204 --> 01:54:51,789
- Yeah.
- Mommy's got you.

1707
01:54:51,790 --> 01:54:54,250
- Still here.
- Shh.

1708
01:54:54,251 --> 01:54:55,750
I know, I know.

1709
01:54:55,751 --> 01:54:57,670
I know. It's okay.

1710
01:54:57,671 --> 01:54:59,213
- Keep her cozy.
- Shh.

1711
01:54:59,922 --> 01:55:01,757
- Oh, hi.
- There we go.

1712
01:55:02,591 --> 01:55:04,760
- Hi, beautiful.
- There we go.

1713
01:55:05,427 --> 01:55:07,595
I'm your daddy.

1714
01:55:07,596 --> 01:55:09,765
Yeah. Yes, you are.

1715
01:55:10,599 --> 01:55:11,767
Yeah.

1716
01:55:13,310 --> 01:55:14,687
What should we call her?

1717
01:55:16,063 --> 01:55:18,524
I was thinking we could name her
after your brother.

1718
01:55:25,948 --> 01:55:28,701
- Emerson.
- Yeah. Emerson.

1719
01:55:29,118 --> 01:55:31,328
That way, we can call her Emmy.

1720
01:55:33,998 --> 01:55:35,332
What do you think?

1721
01:55:37,209 --> 01:55:40,170
I think that's the nicest thing
anyone's ever done for me.

1722
01:55:42,923 --> 01:55:45,593
Thank you.

1723
01:55:49,054 --> 01:55:53,392
Shh. It's okay. It's okay. Daddy's got you.

1724
01:55:53,393 --> 01:55:55,561
Daddy's got you, Emmy.

1725
01:55:56,937 --> 01:55:57,938
Hi.

1726
01:55:59,106 --> 01:56:02,067
Hi, beautiful. I'm your daddy.

1727
01:56:07,990 --> 01:56:09,617
I'm gonna keep you safe, Emmy.

1728
01:56:11,327 --> 01:56:15,289
I'm gonna keep you safe. Shh.

1729
01:56:21,545 --> 01:56:22,880
I want a divorce.

1730
01:56:25,466 --> 01:56:28,010
Hey. Let's not.

1731
01:56:28,011 --> 01:56:29,470
Hey, yes.

1732
01:56:29,803 --> 01:56:31,138
Yeah.

1733
01:56:32,306 --> 01:56:33,390
Yeah.

1734
01:56:35,226 --> 01:56:37,811
It's not for you or me. It's for her.

1735
01:56:37,812 --> 01:56:40,397
Yeah, you know.

1736
01:56:41,649 --> 01:56:42,774
Look at her.

1737
01:56:42,775 --> 01:56:46,695
What if, one day, she came to you
and said, "My boyfriend hit me"?

1738
01:56:46,696 --> 01:56:48,072
What would you...

1739
01:56:49,698 --> 01:56:51,158
What would you say to her?

1740
01:56:54,537 --> 01:56:58,290
Or if she said, "Daddy, my husband
pushed me down the stairs,

1741
01:56:58,291 --> 01:57:01,210
but he said it was an accident,
so it's fine."

1742
01:57:04,088 --> 01:57:07,758
Or if she said her husband held her down
and she begged him to stop,

1743
01:57:08,342 --> 01:57:10,094
but he swore he'd never do it again?

1744
01:57:13,180 --> 01:57:14,848
What would you tell her?

1745
01:57:17,476 --> 01:57:19,520
If the person she loved...

1746
01:57:21,438 --> 01:57:22,439
was...

1747
01:57:23,482 --> 01:57:26,026
was hurting her,
what would you say to her?

1748
01:57:36,453 --> 01:57:38,163
I would beg her to leave him.

1749
01:57:39,999 --> 01:57:41,041
Yeah.

1750
01:57:42,459 --> 01:57:44,295
And I'd beg her never to go back.

1751
01:57:53,304 --> 01:57:56,432
Wanna go to your mama?
You have such a good mama.

1752
01:57:56,433 --> 01:57:57,516
Here.

1753
01:58:01,478 --> 01:58:04,148
I got you, bug. I got you. Yes, my love.

1754
01:58:04,149 --> 01:58:05,900
Okay. I'm gonna...

1755
01:58:35,971 --> 01:58:38,848
Yeah.

1756
01:58:38,849 --> 01:58:41,727
There you go, bug. Mama's got you.

1757
01:58:43,562 --> 01:58:45,147
Mama's got you.

1758
01:58:47,483 --> 01:58:48,776
Yeah.

1759
01:58:50,444 --> 01:58:51,737
Yeah.

1760
01:58:53,155 --> 01:58:55,824
Stops right here, bubba, with you and me.

1761
01:58:59,286 --> 01:59:00,871
It ends with us.

1762
01:59:02,915 --> 01:59:03,958
Okay?

1763
01:59:06,544 --> 01:59:07,878
It ends with us.

1764
01:59:11,215 --> 01:59:13,092
Yeah. Yeah.

1765
01:59:32,528 --> 01:59:33,529
Thank you.

1766
01:59:34,113 --> 01:59:35,531
Oh, Mama, I love you.

1767
01:59:37,992 --> 01:59:39,368
I'm so proud of you.

1768
01:59:48,168 --> 01:59:49,962
- Okay. Okay.
- Okay.

1769
01:59:50,546 --> 01:59:52,172
- Be right back.
- Okay.

1770
01:59:57,761 --> 01:59:59,680
Let's go meet your grandpa.

1771
02:00:03,642 --> 02:00:04,643
Okay.

1772
02:00:15,196 --> 02:00:16,530
Goodbye, Pops.

1773
02:00:20,659 --> 02:00:21,659
Okay.

1774
02:00:24,997 --> 02:00:26,498
That's enough of that.

1775
02:00:29,335 --> 02:00:30,461
Come on.

1776
02:01:20,886 --> 02:01:22,263
Yeah. You got it.

1777
02:02:13,230 --> 02:02:14,481
- Hi.
- Hi.

1778
02:02:16,442 --> 02:02:17,442
How've you...

1779
02:02:17,443 --> 02:02:18,861
Was that your daughter?

1780
02:02:20,070 --> 02:02:21,572
Yeah, that's Emmy.

1781
02:02:22,114 --> 02:02:23,448
I saw you guys before.

1782
02:02:23,449 --> 02:02:24,950
- I just... I didn't...
- Mm-hmm.

1783
02:02:25,576 --> 02:02:26,577
Yeah.

1784
02:02:28,996 --> 02:02:30,684
She's beautiful.

1785
02:02:30,685 --> 02:02:32,374
Thanks.

1786
02:02:34,376 --> 02:02:36,212
Are you still with...

1787
02:02:36,795 --> 02:02:37,922
No.

1788
02:02:38,339 --> 02:02:40,883
No, no, it's... it's just us.

1789
02:02:40,884 --> 02:02:42,343
Oh.

1790
02:02:45,095 --> 02:02:46,096
Wow.

1791
02:02:52,353 --> 02:02:54,772
- Are you with anyone?
- How's the store?

1792
02:02:59,151 --> 02:03:00,319
No.

1793
02:03:03,030 --> 02:03:04,073
Not yet.
