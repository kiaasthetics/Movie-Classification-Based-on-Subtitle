Ah!

I should go.

Oh, no, thank you. I insist.

- You better be here early tomorrow.
- Okay.

00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:55,645
Have a good night!

72
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:56,767
Uh!

73
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:14,163
She was wrecked!
It was pure lunacy, it was...

74
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:18,643
It was so crazy, and I just...
Oh, you would have died.

75
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:25,242
No, Turner's fine.
Turner's fine. I just, um...

76
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:28,449
Are you gonna wait 'til Denver
to tell her, or...?

77
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:33,280
What?

78
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:43,920
Okay.

00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:50,365
No, I'm happy for you.

80
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:54,884
I am. I'm happy for you, I just...

81
00:07:58,360 --> 00:08:00,044
I just thought...

82
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:06,520
- I don't know, I guess I thought...
- One second.

83
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:10,891
- What, Ruby?
- Jessica's on the phone.

84
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:13,122
Um, tell her
I'll call her back.

85
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:14,565
In two minutes?

86
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:16,808
- Less than two minutes.
- I'll go get your lunch.

87
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:18,564
I'm almost done. Thank you.

88
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:31,327
Oh, you know what? I think we're good.
Thanks for coming in.

89
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:38,086
Whoa! Holy shit!
You wanna open a window?

90
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:41,050
- I was trying to give you an entrance.
- Thank you.

91
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:43,009
Mia!
How'd the audition go?

92
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:45,127
Eh.

93
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:47,601
Eh, same here.
Was Jen there or Rachel?

94
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:50,160
- I don't know who Jen and Rachel are.
- They're the worst.

95
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:53,369
- Well, I don't know if they were there.
- I bet they were.

96
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:56,410
Why is there a convention
in the bathroom?

97
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:59,290
Two minutes, people.
Mia, you're coming, right?

98
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:01,601
I can't! I'm working.

99
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:02,841
What?

100
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:06,081
Did she just say "working"?

101
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:07,685
What?

102
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:09,171
I'm sorry it didn't go well today,

103
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:11,456
and there's like four things in my inbox
that you're perfect for,

104
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:14,404
and I will submit you.
But right now you're coming!

105
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:15,766
It'll be fun.

106
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:17,604
- It's not gonna be fun.
- It could be.

107
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:20,121
It's not. It's gonna be
a bunch of social climbers

108
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:22,726
all packed into one of those
big glass houses.

109
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:24,131
This looks familiar.

110
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:26,726
- I was gonna give that back.
- How long have you had this?

111
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:28,768
- A long time.
- Come on, Mia.

112
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:30,136
When else are you gonna get to see

113
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:32,162
every Hollywood cliché crammed
into the same room?

114
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:33,765
We'll make fun of it together!

115
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:35,683
I'm disappointed in you, Lex.

116
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:37,000

00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:35,608
- I got you a throw rug.
- I don't need that.

171
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:38,490
What if I said Miles Davis pissed on it?

172
00:18:38,560 --> 00:18:41,643
It's almost insulting.
Is it true?

173
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:44,371
When are you gonna
unpack these boxes?

174
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:46,124
When I unpack them
in my own club.

175
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:49,727
Oh, Sebastian! It's like a girl broke up
with you and you're stalking her.

176
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:51,404
You're not still going
by there, are you?

177
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:54,245
That's...

178
00:18:54,360 --> 00:18:56,576
You won't believe it. They turned it
into a samba-tapas place.

179
00:18:56,600 --> 00:19:00,241
- Oh, my God, Sebastian!
- Samba. Tapas.

180
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:02,766
Pick one, you know?
Do one right.

181
00:19:02,840 --> 00:19:06,401
- I have someone I want you to meet.
- I don't wanna meet anyone.

182
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:07,816
No, no, I don't wanna meet anyone.

183
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:10,286
- Dad gave you this? You'll like her.
- Yes.

184
00:19:10,360 --> 00:19:12,681
I don't think I'm gonna like her.
Does she like jazz?

185
00:19:12,760 --> 00:19:14,800
- Probably not.
- Then what are we gonna talk about?

186
00:19:14,840 --> 00:19:16,683
I don't know!
It doesn't matter, okay?

187
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:19,849
Because you're living like a hermit.
You're driving without insurance!

188
00:19:19,920 --> 00:19:21,296
- "It doesn't matter"?
- Yeah, it doesn't matter.

189
00:19:21,320 --> 00:19:22,816
- Okay. Well, I know a guy...
- You need to get serious.

190
00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:24,016
...with a face tattoo
that you should see.

191
00:19:24,040 --> 00:19:25,616
- Okay, low blow.
- With a heart of gold.

192
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:27,881
- Get serious!
- "Get serious"?

193
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:32,170
Laura... I had a very serious plan
for my future.

194
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:34,402
- I know.
- It's not my fault I got shanghaied.

195
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:37,643
You didn't get shanghaied.
You got ripped off!

196
00:19:37,720 --> 00:19:38,936
What's the difference?

197
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:42,203
I don't know.
It's not as romantic as that.

198
00:19:42,280 --> 00:19:44,328
Don't sit...

199
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:47,847
Everybody knew that guy
was shady except for you.

200
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:51,606
Why do you say "romantic"
like it's a dirty word?

201
00:19:51,680 --> 00:19:55,526
Unpaid bills are not romantic.
Call her.

202
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:56,886
I'm not gonna call her.

203
00:19:56,960 --> 00:19:58,291
And the thing is...

204
00:19:58,360 --> 00:20:00,567
You're acting like life's got me
on the ropes.

205
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:03,291
I want to be
on the ropes. Okay?

206
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:04,976
I'm letting life hit me
'til it gets tired.

207
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,321
- Oh?
- Then I'm gonna hit back.

208
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:10,210
It's a classic rope-a-dope.

209
00:20:10,280 --> 00:20:13,489
Okay, Ali. I love you.
Unpack the boxes.

210
00:20:13,560 --> 00:20:16,131
- I'm gonna change the locks.
- You can't afford it.

211
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:20,205
I'm a phoenix
rising from the ashes.

212
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:08,761
Hey.

213
00:21:08,840 --> 00:21:11,320
- Bill. Thanks for having me back.
- You're welcome.

214
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:13,056
I want you to know you're lookin'
at a new man,

215
00:21:13,080 --> 00:21:15,208
- a man that's happy to be here.
- Good. Excellent.

216
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:18,363
- Very-easy-to-work-with man.
- And you're going to play the set list?

217
00:21:18,440 --> 00:21:19,851
Happy to.

218
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:22,651
Even though I don't think anyone cares
what I play, but, yeah.

219
00:21:22,760 --> 00:21:26,287
Well, if by "anyone" you mean anyone
other than me, that would be correct.

220
00:21:26,360 --> 00:21:28,249
I care, and I don't wanna hear
the free jazz.

221
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:30,448
Right. Okay.

222
00:21:30,520 --> 00:21:32,124
Although I thought in this town

223
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:35,727
it worked on a sort of
"one for you, one for me" type system.

224
00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:38,849
How 'bout two for you,
one for me?

225
00:21:38,920 --> 00:21:40,649
How 'bout all for you
and none for me?

226
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:42,131
- That's perfect, yes.
- Great.

227
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:43,770
- Okay.
- Mutual decision, then.

228
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:45,330
Right. Made by me.

229
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:47,607
Right. And I sign off on it, so...

230
00:21:47,680 --> 00:21:50,445
Whatever. Tell yourself
what you wanna know.

231
00:21:50,520 --> 00:21:53,808
Well. Welcome back.

232
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:55,882
There's a nice way
to say that, Karen.

233
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:00,331
Seb.

234
00:25:12,840 --> 00:25:14,216
I hear what you're saying,

235
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:15,936
but I don't think you're saying
what you mean.

236
00:25:15,960 --> 00:25:17,936
Yeah, I don't think you hear
what I'm saying. You're fired.

237
00:25:17,960 --> 00:25:20,216
Well, that's what you're saying,
but it's not what you mean.

238
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:22,481
- What you mean is...
- You're fired.

239
00:25:22,560 --> 00:25:25,803
- "Play the set list."
- No, I'm saying it's too late.

240
00:25:25,880 --> 00:25:28,486
- It's a warning.
- What planet are you from?

241
00:25:28,560 --> 00:25:31,530
- Don't fire me, Bill. Don't fire me.
- You're done. I'm sorry, Seb.

242
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:32,886
It's Christmas.

243
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:36,089
Yeah, I see the decorations.
Good luck in the new year.

244
00:25:50,120 --> 00:25:52,600
I just heard you play,
and I wanted to...

245
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:11,681
I don't like the fissure on the GT scan.
Did you test for achromatopsia?

246
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:15,367
DOA on 23rd. Perp laughin'
his face off at the PD.

247
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:16,851
Damn Miranda rights.

248
00:26:16,920 --> 00:26:18,968
This is my classroom.

249
00:26:19,040 --> 00:26:20,929
You don't like it,
the door's to my left.

250
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:23,002
Lady, why you be trippin' like that?

251
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:28,483
No, Jamal.
You be trippin'.

252
00:26:37,640 --> 00:26:39,005

"I Ran."
A fantastic suggestion.

All right, piano man,
tickle those ivories.

All right, I remember you.

304
00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:34,447
And I'll admit
I was a little curt that night.

305
00:29:34,520 --> 00:29:35,681
Curt?

306
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:37,649
Okay, I was an asshole.
I can admit that.

307
00:29:37,720 --> 00:29:38,721
Okay.

308
00:29:38,800 --> 00:29:42,043
But requesting "I Ran" from a serious
musician, it's just... It's too far.

309
00:29:42,120 --> 00:29:45,761
My Lord! Did you just say
"a serious musician"?

310
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:48,002
- I don't think so.
- Can I borrow what you're wearing?

311
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:49,844
- Why?
- 'Cause I have an audition next week.

312
00:29:49,920 --> 00:29:51,922
I'm playing a "serious" firefighter.

313
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,040
So you're an actress.
I thought you looked familiar.

314
00:29:54,080 --> 00:29:55,730
Have I seen you in anything?

315
00:29:55,800 --> 00:29:59,850
Uh... coffee shop on the Warner Bros. lot.
That's a classic.

316
00:29:59,920 --> 00:30:01,888
- Oh, I see. You're a barista.
- Yeah.

317
00:30:01,960 --> 00:30:05,043
And I can see how you could then
look down on me from all the way up there.

318
00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:07,122
Time to do the next set.

319
00:30:08,280 --> 00:30:11,887
He doesn't... I don't...
he doesn't tell me what to do.

320
00:30:11,960 --> 00:30:13,371
He just told you what to do.

321
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:16,330
I know. I let him.
What's your name?

322
00:30:16,400 --> 00:30:17,447
- Mia.
- Mia.

323
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:21,489
Guess I'll see you
in the movies.

324
00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:25,976
- You heard of Joseph Campbell?
- Uh, yeah.

325
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,496
I have this idea to do a re-imagining
of <i>Goldilocks and The Three Bears,</i>

326
00:30:28,520 --> 00:30:30,090
but from the perspective
of the bears.

327
00:30:30,160 --> 00:30:32,096
- The hero's journey.
- It could be like a franchise.

328
00:30:32,120 --> 00:30:33,176
- Right.
- So we don't know.

329
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:34,936
There could have been a fourth bear,
we don't know.

330
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:36,803
George Michael!

331
00:30:41,400 --> 00:30:42,640
Hello.

332
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:44,051
- Sorry, it's...
- Yeah, yeah.

333
00:30:44,120 --> 00:30:46,600
I know that guy.
Did you get your keys?

334
00:30:49,040 --> 00:30:50,690
Mmm-hmm, yes.

335
00:30:50,760 --> 00:30:53,001
- Can you grab mine?
- Can I what?

336
00:30:53,120 --> 00:30:54,616
Would you be able
to grab mine? My keys?

337
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:55,801
- I can't hear.
- Sorry.

338
00:30:55,880 --> 00:30:58,690
- Can you grab my keys?
- Oh.

339
00:30:58,760 --> 00:31:00,000
- Please?
- Oh, there we go.

340
00:31:00,080 --> 00:31:01,889
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

341
00:31:04,160 --> 00:31:06,128
- What kind?
- It's a Prius.

342
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:10,130
That doesn't help me.

343
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:12,885
- With a green ribbon.
- All right.

344
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:20,004
- Those look, uh, comfortable.
- They are.

345
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:23,762
Thank you for saving the day
back there.

346
00:31:25,920 --> 00:31:28,810
Well, you didn't really
give me much of a choice.

347
00:31:29,920 --> 00:31:32,810
It's pretty strange that we keep running
into each other.

348
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:36,805
It is strange.
Maybe it means something.

349
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:38,216
- I doubt it.
- Yeah, I don't think so.

350
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:40,527
Where's my car?

351
00:31:40,600 --> 00:31:42,602
You gotta put that thing
to your chin.

352
00:31:42,680 --> 00:31:44,091
- This?
- Yeah.

353
00:31:45,240 --> 00:31:46,896
Yeah, it makes your head
into an antenna, so...

354
00:31:46,920 --> 00:31:48,256
- Ooh.
- I think it gives you cancer,

355
00:31:48,280 --> 00:31:50,089
- but you find your car faster.
- What?

356
00:31:50,160 --> 00:31:52,976
You don't live as long, but you get where
you're going quicker, so it all evens out.

357
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:54,525
That sounds terrible.

358
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:57,211
- Just a suggestion.
- You're a...

359
00:31:57,280 --> 00:32:00,045
You're a real, um...
what's the word I'm looking for?

360
00:32:00,120 --> 00:32:01,724
"Knight in shining armor"?

361
00:32:01,800 --> 00:32:04,849
- Weirdo. That was the word.
- Okay.

362
00:32:11,640 --> 00:32:13,051
Not much to look at, huh?

363
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:15,684

Hi, Greg.
Oh, sorry I'm late.

398
00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:25,841
Yeah. Be there soon.
Okay, bye.

399
00:36:46,920 --> 00:36:48,922
- It was just right there.
- Just right here.

400
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:57,165
Do you want a ride
to your car?

401
00:36:57,240 --> 00:36:59,527
No, I'm just right up here.

402
00:37:02,080 --> 00:37:03,684
Good night.

403
00:37:09,920 --> 00:37:11,445
Good night.

404
00:38:23,720 --> 00:38:26,087
Excuse me.
This is gluten-free, right?

405
00:38:27,120 --> 00:38:29,009
- No.
- What?

406
00:38:29,080 --> 00:38:30,570
Mmm-mmm.

407
00:38:30,640 --> 00:38:32,404
Ugh!
I'd like a refund.

408
00:38:34,200 --> 00:38:37,010
Okay. Let me check on that for you.

409
00:38:38,240 --> 00:38:39,287
Mia...

410
00:38:39,360 --> 00:38:41,886
- Hi.
- You're closing Friday.

411
00:38:41,960 --> 00:38:44,611
I can't close on Friday.
I have an audition, remember?

412
00:38:44,680 --> 00:38:47,001
Do I look like I care?
Reschedule it.

413
00:38:47,080 --> 00:38:50,163
Oh, and we need to have a little talk
tomorrow, okay?

414
00:38:50,240 --> 00:38:51,969
Fix your apron, please.

415
00:38:52,040 --> 00:38:53,280
Okay.

416
00:38:58,040 --> 00:38:59,485
You again!

417
00:39:01,240 --> 00:39:02,526
What are you doing here?

418
00:39:02,600 --> 00:39:05,843
Oh, you know, just meetings
and... studio heads and...

419
00:39:05,920 --> 00:39:07,285
How'd you get on the lot?

420
00:39:07,360 --> 00:39:10,921
I basically
just hauled ass past the guard gates.

421
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:12,760
I think I have 20 minutes
until they find me.

422
00:39:13,800 --> 00:39:15,529
You don't have a break
coming up, do you?

423
00:39:15,600 --> 00:39:17,409
I'm off in 10 minutes, so...

424
00:39:18,840 --> 00:39:20,205
Can I hide
in the bathroom?

425
00:39:20,280 --> 00:39:22,442
- Yes.
- Okay.

426
00:39:23,640 --> 00:39:24,926
Sorry.

427
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:27,970
Um... I actually do have to check.
I'm sorry.

428
00:39:32,160 --> 00:39:34,686
That's the window that Humphrey Bogart
and Ingrid Bergman

429
00:39:34,760 --> 00:39:35,886
looked out of in <i>Casablanca.</i>

430
00:39:35,960 --> 00:39:37,200
- Wow!
- Yeah.

431
00:39:37,240 --> 00:39:39,216
I can't believe you work
right across the street from that.

432
00:39:39,240 --> 00:39:41,004
- Yeah.
- That's amazing.

433
00:39:41,080 --> 00:39:44,880
What was your Bogart's name?

434
00:39:44,960 --> 00:39:47,167
What's his name?
Is it Greg?

435
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:49,282
Yeah. Greg.

436
00:39:49,360 --> 00:39:52,170
Right. How long have you been...

437
00:39:52,240 --> 00:39:54,080
We've been seeing each other
for about a month.

438
00:39:54,120 --> 00:39:55,690
Oh, that's great.

439
00:39:55,760 --> 00:39:57,091
He's, um... He's sweet.

440
00:39:57,160 --> 00:39:59,242
Anyway, I love
being around this stuff, you know?

441
00:39:59,320 --> 00:40:00,321
I know what you mean.

442
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:03,643
I get coffee five miles out of the way
just so I can be near a jazz club.

443
00:40:03,720 --> 00:40:05,210
- Really?
- Yeah, the Van Beek.

444
00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:06,361
- Do you know it?
- Mmm-mmm.

445
00:40:06,440 --> 00:40:10,889
All the big swing bands used to play
there. Count Basie, Chick Webb.

446
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:13,361
Anyway, it's a samba-tapas
place now, so...

447
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:16,211
What's a samba-tapas place?

448
00:40:16,280 --> 00:40:18,760
It's just a samba place
where they serve tapas.

449
00:40:18,840 --> 00:40:20,808
- Oh.
- Yeah, so the joke's on...

450
00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:22,120
history?

451
00:40:22,200 --> 00:40:23,486
I don't know. That's L.A.

452
00:40:23,560 --> 00:40:27,246
They just worship everything
and they value nothing.

453
00:40:27,360 --> 00:40:29,727
We're about to roll.
Stop, please, guys.

454
00:40:29,800 --> 00:40:30,926
Okay.

455
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:32,570
- You're rolling?
- Yeah.

456
00:40:32,640 --> 00:40:35,056
I know. They shoot movies on my street
all the time, so I know about movies.

457
00:40:35,080 --> 00:40:36,286
- Come this way.
- Great.

458
00:40:36,360 --> 00:40:38,681
It's a lock-down.

459
00:40:38,760 --> 00:40:40,728
- I love her!
- And here we go.

460
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:42,723
Hey! How'd you get
into all this?

461
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:44,245
And roll!

462
00:40:44,320 --> 00:40:45,760
- Get into what?
- Sound speed!

463
00:40:45,800 --> 00:40:47,325
You know, movies, acting...

464
00:40:47,400 --> 00:40:49,402
- Action!
- Oh, um...

465
00:40:49,480 --> 00:40:52,324
- My aunt was an actress.
- Oh, okay.

466
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:54,767
She was in a traveling
theater company.

467
00:40:54,840 --> 00:40:57,047
I grew up in Boulder City, Nevada.

468
00:40:57,120 --> 00:40:59,726
So across the street from my house
there was this little library

469
00:40:59,800 --> 00:41:01,404
that had an old movie section.

470
00:41:01,520 --> 00:41:05,923
So she took me and we spent an entire day
watching all these old movies

471
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:10,050
like <i>Notorious</i> and <i>Bringing Up Baby</i>
and <i>Casablanca.</i>

472
00:41:10,120 --> 00:41:11,565
- And...
- Cut it there! Cut!

473
00:41:11,640 --> 00:41:13,720
- Check the gate.
- So we can talk now.

474
00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:15,603
- She sounds incredible.
- She was incredible.

475
00:41:15,680 --> 00:41:18,286
And I would put on all these plays
in my bedroom,

476
00:41:18,360 --> 00:41:23,605
and it would basically just be she and I
re-enacting those scenes from the movies.

477
00:41:23,680 --> 00:41:25,091
And then I would
write my own plays.

478
00:41:25,160 --> 00:41:26,730
- Wow.
- Um... Yeah.

479
00:41:47,880 --> 00:41:49,484
I love it.

480
00:41:53,640 --> 00:41:56,689
So anyway, I left college
after two years to come here

481
00:41:56,760 --> 00:41:59,604
and my last audition was
for a teen show

482
00:41:59,680 --> 00:42:01,842
pitched as <i>"Dangerous Minds</i>
meets <i>The O.C."</i>

483
00:42:01,920 --> 00:42:06,005
So, yeah, should've
been a lawyer.

484
00:42:06,080 --> 00:42:08,003
'Cause the world
needs more lawyers.

485
00:42:08,080 --> 00:42:10,208
It doesn't
need more actresses.

486
00:42:10,280 --> 00:42:11,691
You're not
just an actress.

487
00:42:11,760 --> 00:42:14,366
- What do you mean, "just an actress"?
- You said it yourself.

488
00:42:14,440 --> 00:42:16,886
You're a child prodigy
playwright.

489
00:42:16,960 --> 00:42:18,405
That is not what I said.

490
00:42:18,480 --> 00:42:22,007
Well, you're too modest
to say it, but it's true.

491
00:42:22,080 --> 00:42:23,880
You could just write
your own roles, you know?

492
00:42:23,920 --> 00:42:25,840
Write something that's
as interesting as you are,

493
00:42:25,880 --> 00:42:27,416
and you don't have to audition
for this...

494
00:42:27,440 --> 00:42:28,771
- uh, piece of caca.
- Yeah.

495
00:42:28,840 --> 00:42:30,251
Look at Louis Armstrong.

496
00:42:30,360 --> 00:42:33,011
He could've just played the marching band
charts that he was given.

497
00:42:33,080 --> 00:42:34,809
But he didn't do that.
What did he do?

498
00:42:34,880 --> 00:42:38,248
- What did he do?
- He made history, didn't he?

499
00:42:38,320 --> 00:42:41,290
Well, I'm gonna stop auditioning
and I'm gonna make history instead.

500
00:42:42,280 --> 00:42:46,046
Well, my work is done here.

501
00:42:46,120 --> 00:42:49,283
I should probably tell you something now,
just to get it out of the way.

502
00:42:49,360 --> 00:42:50,600
- Mmm-hmm?
- I hate jazz.

503
00:42:53,400 --> 00:42:54,561
Are you okay?

504
00:42:54,640 --> 00:42:56,927
What do you mean,
you hate jazz?

505
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:58,816
It just means that when I listen to it,
I don't like it.

506
00:42:58,840 --> 00:43:01,764
Yeah, but it's such a blanket statement
you don't like jazz.

507
00:43:01,840 --> 00:43:03,080
What are you doing right now?

508
00:43:04,440 --> 00:43:05,851
Nothing.

509
00:43:22,720 --> 00:43:25,485
I just think that people,
when they say that they...

510
00:43:26,520 --> 00:43:30,047
you know, hate jazz, they just...

511
00:43:30,120 --> 00:43:33,966
They don't have context, they don't know
where it comes from.

512
00:43:34,040 --> 00:43:37,681
Jazz was born in a little
flophouse in New Orleans,

513
00:43:37,800 --> 00:43:39,776
and it's just because people
were crammed in there,

514
00:43:39,800 --> 00:43:42,416
they spoke five different languages,
they couldn't talk to each other.

515
00:43:42,440 --> 00:43:46,240
The only way they could communicate
was with jazz.

516
00:43:46,320 --> 00:43:47,731
Yeah, but what about Kenny G?

517
00:43:49,200 --> 00:43:51,043
- What?
- What about Kenny G?

518
00:43:51,120 --> 00:43:52,963
I mean, what about elevator music?

519
00:43:53,040 --> 00:43:55,520
You know,
jazz music that I know?

520
00:43:55,600 --> 00:43:57,364
- What about it?
- From my life?

521
00:43:57,440 --> 00:43:59,761
- Mmm-hmm?
- I just find it relaxing.

522
00:43:59,840 --> 00:44:02,241
It's not relaxing.
It's not, it's not.

523
00:44:02,320 --> 00:44:05,449
Sidney Bechet shot somebody because
they told him he played a wrong note.

524
00:44:05,520 --> 00:44:06,760
That's hardly relaxing.

525
00:44:06,840 --> 00:44:11,050
Yeah, but where I grew up there was
this station called K-jazz 103.

526
00:44:11,120 --> 00:44:14,016
And people would just put on that station
when they had a cocktail party...

527
00:44:14,040 --> 00:44:15,280
Right.

528
00:44:15,360 --> 00:44:17,522
And everyone would
kinda just talk over it.

529
00:44:17,600 --> 00:44:18,601
I know.

530
00:44:18,680 --> 00:44:20,176
- 'Cause it was...
- That's the prob...

531
00:44:20,200 --> 00:44:22,567
Okay, okay. So I think
that's part of the problem,

532
00:44:22,680 --> 00:44:24,496
is that you can't hear it, you know?
You have to see it.

533
00:44:24,520 --> 00:44:26,856
You have to see what's at stake.
I mean, look at these fellas.

534
00:44:26,880 --> 00:44:29,167
Look at the sax player
right now.

535
00:44:29,240 --> 00:44:31,481
He just hijacked the song.
He's on his own trip.

536
00:44:31,560 --> 00:44:33,164
Every one of these guys
is composing,

537
00:44:33,240 --> 00:44:34,969
they're rearranging,
they're writing.

538
00:44:35,040 --> 00:44:36,616
Then they're playing the melody.
They're just...

539
00:44:36,640 --> 00:44:38,005
And now look,
the trumpet player.

540
00:44:38,080 --> 00:44:39,570
He's got his own idea.

541
00:44:39,640 --> 00:44:44,168
And so, it's conflict,
and it's compromise, and it's just...

542
00:44:44,240 --> 00:44:45,605
It's new every time.

543
00:44:45,680 --> 00:44:49,162
It's brand-new every night.
It's very, very exciting.

544
00:44:56,480 --> 00:44:59,723
And it's dying.
It's dying, Mia.

545
00:44:59,840 --> 00:45:01,285
It's dying on the vine.

546
00:45:01,360 --> 00:45:04,682
And the world says, "Let it die.
It had its time."

547
00:45:04,760 --> 00:45:06,569
Well, not on my watch.

548
00:45:07,920 --> 00:45:11,447
- What are you gonna do?
- I'm gonna have my own club.

549
00:45:11,560 --> 00:45:13,130
- Really?
- Yes.

550
00:45:13,200 --> 00:45:16,010
We're gonna play whatever we want,
whenever we want,

551
00:45:16,080 --> 00:45:20,324
however we want,
as long as it's pure jazz.

552
00:45:21,440 --> 00:45:22,680
<i>Hi, this is Mia Dolan.</i>

553
00:45:23,680 --> 00:45:25,205
Yeah, I just missed a call.

554
00:45:32,320 --> 00:45:35,085
- I got a callback!
- What? Come on!

555
00:45:35,160 --> 00:45:36,525
For what?

556
00:45:36,600 --> 00:45:39,649
For a TV show. The one I was
telling you about earlier.

557
00:45:39,720 --> 00:45:41,927
- The <i>"Dangerous Minds</i> meets <i>The O.C."?</i>
- Yeah.

558
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:44,296
- Congratulations! That's incredible!
- It's really exciting.

559
00:45:44,320 --> 00:45:46,322
I feel like I said negative
stuff about it before.

560
00:45:46,400 --> 00:45:48,448
- What?
- It's like <i>Rebel Without a Cause.</i>

561
00:45:49,600 --> 00:45:51,648
"I got the bullets!"

562
00:45:51,720 --> 00:45:54,200
Yes.

563
00:45:54,280 --> 00:45:56,123
- You've never seen it!
- I've never seen it.

564
00:45:56,200 --> 00:45:58,885
Oh, my! You know,
it's playing at the Rialto.

565
00:45:58,960 --> 00:46:00,086
- Really?
- Yes.

566
00:46:00,160 --> 00:46:03,642
You should go... I mean,
I can take you.

567
00:46:03,720 --> 00:46:04,721
Okay.

568
00:46:04,800 --> 00:46:06,296
- You know, for research.
- For research.

569
00:46:06,320 --> 00:46:08,163
- Yeah. Okay.
- Yeah.

570
00:46:08,240 --> 00:46:10,402
Um, Monday night, 10:00.

571
00:46:10,480 --> 00:46:12,289
- Yeah. Great.
- Okay.

572
00:46:12,360 --> 00:46:13,725
For research.

In your own time.

584
00:48:32,920 --> 00:48:34,206
Okay.

585
00:48:38,120 --> 00:48:39,610
Two options.

586
00:48:39,680 --> 00:48:42,001
You either follow my rules

- <i>Capisce?</i>
- Thank you.

588

- Oh...
- Thanks.

589
00:48:45,960 --> 00:48:47,200
I can do it a different way.

590
00:48:47,280 --> 00:48:49,681
No, that's fine.
Thank you very much. Thank you.

591
00:48:58,160 --> 00:48:59,241
That was fun. Thanks.

592
00:48:59,320 --> 00:49:00,560
Bye.

593
00:49:29,640 --> 00:49:31,529
Oh, hey, Mia?

594
00:49:31,600 --> 00:49:33,602
- Hey.
- Greg's here.

595
00:49:33,680 --> 00:49:37,685
- What do you mean...
- Hey, babe. Got a space out front.

596
00:49:37,760 --> 00:49:39,489
- Great.
- We should get going.

597
00:49:39,560 --> 00:49:41,160
- Okay.
- My brother landed really early.

598
00:49:44,120 --> 00:49:46,771
- Did you forget? You forgot.
- Shit.

599
00:49:46,840 --> 00:49:48,569
That's tonight.

600
00:49:48,640 --> 00:49:50,961
- That's okay. You forgot.
- Yeah. Okay.

601
00:49:51,040 --> 00:49:52,496
All right, so then
I'll just get changed.

602
00:49:52,520 --> 00:49:55,000
- Okay. Great.
- Okay. Great.

603
00:49:57,520 --> 00:49:58,806
- Yeah, that's him.
- Um...

604
00:49:58,880 --> 00:50:00,644
Hey, Josh, yeah. Uh...

605
00:50:00,720 --> 00:50:03,724
Just pickin' up Mia.
We'll be there in, like...

606
00:50:04,760 --> 00:50:07,216
<i>But now we've got this
surround-sound set-up, so it's like...</i>

607
00:50:07,240 --> 00:50:09,607
- It's like being in a movie theater.
- Wow.

608
00:50:09,680 --> 00:50:11,136
But better than being
in a theater, really.

609
00:50:11,160 --> 00:50:13,096
- I can't wait.
- You know theaters these days.

610
00:50:13,120 --> 00:50:14,963
- Yeah.
- They're so dirty.

611
00:50:15,040 --> 00:50:16,451
Yeah, I know.
And so smelly.

612
00:50:16,520 --> 00:50:18,176
And they're either
too hot or too cold.

613
00:50:18,200 --> 00:50:19,896
I know. The quality's
really fallen off.

614
00:50:19,920 --> 00:50:22,416
The quality's terrible.
And there's always people talking.

615
00:50:22,440 --> 00:50:24,056
- Because...
- Which is just... Oh, it's the worst!

616
00:50:24,080 --> 00:50:25,496
Oh, I'm sorry.

617
00:50:25,520 --> 00:50:27,249
- Hold on one second.
- The texting.

618
00:50:28,240 --> 00:50:29,241
Hello?

619
00:50:29,320 --> 00:50:30,890
- Probably work.
- Mmm.

620
00:50:36,760 --> 00:50:39,764
- Sorry. So, yeah, we love it.
- Oh, it's so nice.

621
00:50:39,840 --> 00:50:43,890
- Well, we have to come. Maybe.
- You should. Come by.

622
00:51:00,840 --> 00:51:02,576
- I got one word for you, man.
- Mmm-hmm?

623
00:51:02,600 --> 00:51:05,843
- Indonesia.
- Never heard anyone say that.

624
00:51:05,920 --> 00:51:09,080
I don't even know. I can't keep track
of it, but honestly, it was life-changing.

625
00:51:09,120 --> 00:51:11,361
- Really?
- Yeah. It affected me.

626
00:51:11,440 --> 00:51:13,966
- It was incredible.
- Is it amazing?

627
00:51:14,040 --> 00:51:16,247
- Yes.
- A 5-star jungle eco-resort

628
00:51:16,320 --> 00:51:18,129
- you would not believe.
- Amazing.

629
00:51:18,200 --> 00:51:19,531
We were thinking about Nicaragua.

630
00:51:19,600 --> 00:51:22,416
The thing about Nicaragua is it's less
developed, it's a little under-developed.

631
00:51:22,440 --> 00:51:23,441
Right.

632
00:51:23,520 --> 00:51:27,206
I think there's a little more... Yeah,
then, I just don't know if it's safe.

633
00:51:27,280 --> 00:51:28,964
- Yeah, yeah. It's...
- You know?

634
00:51:29,040 --> 00:51:30,216
fiancée Yeah, you don't want
to explore too far.

635
00:51:30,240 --> 00:51:32,080
Kind of a "natives are
restless" sort of thing.

636
00:51:33,120 --> 00:51:35,930
Actually, China's going
to build a canal.

637
00:52:00,640 --> 00:52:02,130
I'm sorry.

638
00:53:36,600 --> 00:53:38,967
<i>...the
immensity of our universe.</i>

639
00:53:39,040 --> 00:53:41,850

640
00:53:41,920 --> 00:53:43,649

00:53:43,720 --> 00:53:48,248

<i>I'll go find a place.
I'm sorry.</i>

00:53:56,480 --> 00:53:58,016
<i>As this star approaches us,</i>

646
00:53:58,040 --> 00:53:59,963

647
00:54:00,040 --> 00:54:04,204
<i>The great polar fields of the north

00:54:04,280 --> 00:54:07,329

649
00:54:07,400 --> 00:54:10,643
<i>The last of us search the heavens

650
00:54:10,720 --> 00:54:13,564

651
00:54:26,360 --> 00:54:27,600
Mmm...

652
00:54:31,040 --> 00:54:33,088
I have an idea.

653
00:59:07,640 --> 00:59:09,449
What is that?
Is it a script?

654
00:59:09,520 --> 00:59:10,931
It's a play.

655
00:59:11,000 --> 00:59:13,844
A play?
You better give us all roles!

656
00:59:13,920 --> 00:59:17,766
Actually, it's a one-woman show!
So I can't.

657
00:59:22,680 --> 00:59:25,570
Wow. Is that gonna
happen every time?

658
00:59:25,640 --> 00:59:27,290
I think so.

659
00:59:42,440 --> 00:59:44,488
Ahh! It's one-way!

660
01:02:05,760 --> 01:02:07,489
I love you.

661
01:02:17,600 --> 01:02:19,329
Oh!

662
01:02:21,560 --> 01:02:23,050
Sebastian?

663
01:02:26,560 --> 01:02:27,846
Keith.

664
01:02:27,920 --> 01:02:29,331
Come here, man.

665
01:02:31,160 --> 01:02:32,924
- How are you?
- I've been good, man.

666
01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:34,764
This is Mia. Mia, Keith.

667
01:02:34,840 --> 01:02:36,080
Hi, Mia. Nice to meet you.

668
01:02:36,160 --> 01:02:38,731
- Nice to meet you.
- I used to play with this guy.

669
01:02:38,800 --> 01:02:40,404
Went to school together.

670
01:02:40,480 --> 01:02:42,130
- So how you been, brother?
- Great.

671
01:02:42,200 --> 01:02:43,645
Never been better.
How 'bout you?

672
01:02:43,720 --> 01:02:45,484
I been really good.
Been very busy.

673
01:02:45,560 --> 01:02:48,040
- I got a new combo.
- Okay. Cool.

674
01:02:48,120 --> 01:02:49,565
We're lookin' for keys.

675
01:02:50,960 --> 01:02:53,486
- Are you kidding me?
- No, I'm not kidding you.

676
01:02:53,560 --> 01:02:55,449
- No, I'm good.
- Are you sure? It pays.

677
01:02:56,640 --> 01:02:58,290
I'm good.

678
01:02:58,360 --> 01:03:00,647
Let's just grab a drink then.
It's been too long.

679
01:03:00,720 --> 01:03:02,006
- Okay.
- Nice to meet you, Mia.

680
01:03:02,080 --> 01:03:03,491
Nice to meet you.

681
01:03:13,160 --> 01:03:14,685
"The end."

682
01:03:19,640 --> 01:03:21,642
- Genius.
- Really?

683
01:03:21,720 --> 01:03:23,370
- Yes. Yes.
- Really?

684
01:03:23,440 --> 01:03:24,720
It feels really nostalgic to me.

685
01:03:24,760 --> 01:03:26,296
- Is it too nostalgic?
- That's the point.

686
01:03:26,320 --> 01:03:28,721
Are people gonna like it?

687
01:03:28,800 --> 01:03:31,371
- Fuck 'em.
- You always say that.

688
01:03:31,440 --> 01:03:35,126
- Well, I truly believe it.
- I made you something.

689
01:03:35,200 --> 01:03:37,851
- For what?
- For your club.

690
01:03:39,720 --> 01:03:41,006
Why does it say "Seb's"?

691
01:03:41,080 --> 01:03:42,696
'Cause I think you should call it "Seb's."

692
01:03:42,720 --> 01:03:43,816
- What?
- 'Cause no one will come

693
01:03:43,840 --> 01:03:45,410
to "Chicken on a Stick."

694
01:03:45,480 --> 01:03:47,403
Is that a music note
as an apostrophe?

695
01:03:47,480 --> 01:03:48,800
- Yes! Yeah.
- That's pretty cool.

696
01:03:48,840 --> 01:03:50,968
It's gotta be "Chicken on a Stick,"

697
01:03:51,040 --> 01:03:52,883
because Charlie Parker
got his nickname...

698
01:03:52,960 --> 01:03:55,281
I know, because he loved chicken.

699
01:03:55,360 --> 01:03:58,603
That's why they called him "Bird."

700
01:03:58,680 --> 01:04:01,445
So I'm gonna have chicken, beer, jazz.
"Chicken on a Stick."

701
01:04:01,520 --> 01:04:04,808
I know. You should drop the chicken
and just have drinks and jazz, and also...

702
01:04:04,880 --> 01:04:07,963
- I'm not droppin' the chicken.
- You could maybe do it somewhere else.

703
01:04:08,040 --> 01:04:09,376
- What are you talk...
- Find a new spot.

704
01:04:09,400 --> 01:04:10,845
It's gotta be the Van Beek.

705
01:04:10,920 --> 01:04:12,296
Well, it doesn't have to be the Van Beek.

706
01:04:12,320 --> 01:04:14,766
I can't let them samba
all over its history.

707
01:04:14,840 --> 01:04:16,763
I can't do it.

708
01:04:16,840 --> 01:04:19,161
You can let them,
but you refuse to.

709
01:04:19,240 --> 01:04:21,686
Your play's incredible.

710
01:04:21,760 --> 01:04:25,970
You know, the whole world
from your bedroom.

711
01:04:26,040 --> 01:04:29,044
What else do they want?
Who's doing that?

712
01:04:30,080 --> 01:04:32,321
- I'm doing that.
- You're doing that.

713
01:04:33,320 --> 01:04:37,644
Who was that guy at The Lighthouse?
The guy that offered you the gig?

714
01:04:37,720 --> 01:04:38,846
- Keith.
- Yeah.

715
01:04:38,920 --> 01:04:43,005
- Why was it so weird between you two?
- It's always weird with him.

716
01:04:43,080 --> 01:04:44,320
- Really?
- Yeah.

717
01:04:44,440 --> 01:04:47,683
But he seemed kinda nice
'cause he did offer you a job.

718
01:04:48,760 --> 01:04:52,890
- Are you gonna call him?
- No. No.

719
01:04:52,960 --> 01:04:54,883
All right.

720
01:04:54,960 --> 01:04:58,248
So... Here's what we know.

721
01:04:58,320 --> 01:05:00,129
Yeah?

722
01:05:00,200 --> 01:05:03,602
It's definitely
"Chicken on a Stick,"

723
01:05:03,680 --> 01:05:05,728
and your play
is gonna be a triumph.

724
01:05:08,720 --> 01:05:10,961
It's a one-woman show,
so it's just me...

725
01:05:11,040 --> 01:05:13,520
No, I mean, I'm acting in it, too.

726
01:05:15,160 --> 01:05:18,846
No, Mom, I'm not getting paid.
I'm paying to do it.

727
01:05:21,120 --> 01:05:23,805
He's great. He's gonna
open his own jazz club.

728
01:05:23,880 --> 01:05:25,530
Yeah, it's gonna be incredible.

729
01:05:27,960 --> 01:05:29,724
No, he hasn't.
He hasn't opened it yet.

730
01:05:29,800 --> 01:05:31,040
He needs some...

731
01:05:35,200 --> 01:05:36,929
He's saving up, I think.

732
01:05:43,080 --> 01:05:45,082
No, he doesn't have a steady gig.

733
01:05:45,160 --> 01:05:47,970
But he's figuring it out,
it's just been a little tricky lately.

734
01:05:52,080 --> 01:05:55,243
Morn, he's gonna find a way to open it
and you're gonna love it, okay?

735
01:05:55,320 --> 01:05:56,560
How's Dad?

736
01:06:04,520 --> 01:06:07,729
Sebastian.
Come on in, man.

737
01:06:09,280 --> 01:06:11,123
- Thanks for comin'.
- Thanks for having me.

738
01:06:11,200 --> 01:06:13,567
Wasn't sure I'd see you today.

739
01:06:13,640 --> 01:06:15,529
- So... Here's the deal.
- Okay.

740
01:06:15,600 --> 01:06:18,524
We got distribution with Universal.
We've got our own imprint.

741
01:06:18,600 --> 01:06:20,011
About to go on the road.

742
01:06:20,120 --> 01:06:22,168
Uh, we can pay you 1,000 bucks a week,

743
01:06:22,240 --> 01:06:25,369
plus a cut of the ticket revenue
and merchandising.

744
01:06:25,440 --> 01:06:27,090
Sound good?

745
01:06:29,520 --> 01:06:31,602
- Sebastian? All right.
- Yeah.

746
01:06:31,680 --> 01:06:32,966
- Let's play-
- Okay.

747
01:07:27,280 --> 01:07:28,930
<i>♪ Tonight. ♪</i>

748
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:33,081
I know. It's different.

749
01:07:35,200 --> 01:07:37,567
But you say
you wanna save jazz.

750
01:07:37,640 --> 01:07:40,086
How you gonna save jazz
if no one's listening?

751
01:07:40,200 --> 01:07:42,646
Jazz is dying
because of people like you.

752
01:07:42,720 --> 01:07:46,930
You're playin' to 90-year-olds
at The Lighthouse.

753
01:07:47,040 --> 01:07:49,486
Where are the kids?
Where are the young people?

754
01:07:49,560 --> 01:07:53,963
You're so obsessed with Kenny Clarke
and Thelonious Monk.

755
01:07:54,040 --> 01:07:55,690
These guys were revolutionaries.

756
01:07:55,800 --> 01:07:59,885
How are you gonna be a revolutionary
if you're such a traditionalist?

757
01:07:59,960 --> 01:08:03,760
You're holdin' onto the past,
but jazz is about the future.

758
01:08:08,720 --> 01:08:10,563
I know.

759
01:08:10,640 --> 01:08:13,564
The other guy,
he wasn't as good as you.

760
01:08:14,960 --> 01:08:17,725

Uh, I'm not sure where you are right now.

833
01:16:41,280 --> 01:16:45,524
I think Boston?
Maybe Dallas, I don't know.

834
01:16:45,600 --> 01:16:47,489
Uh...

835
01:16:47,560 --> 01:16:52,771
I haven't heard from you in a little while
and I miss you.

836
01:16:55,240 --> 01:16:56,844
All right, bye.

837
01:17:33,280 --> 01:17:36,489
I thought...
Surprise.

Gotta leave first thing in the morning,
but I just had to see you...

839
01:17:47,880 --> 01:17:49,689
It's so nice to be home.

840
01:17:52,520 --> 01:17:54,170
I'm so glad you're home.

841
01:17:56,560 --> 01:17:58,801
How's the play goin'?

842
01:17:58,880 --> 01:18:00,530
Um... I'm nervous.

843
01:18:00,600 --> 01:18:02,329
- You are? Why?
- Mmm-hmm.

844
01:18:02,400 --> 01:18:04,402
Because what if people show up'?

845
01:18:04,480 --> 01:18:05,766
Piece of caca.

846
01:18:05,840 --> 01:18:10,323
- You nervous about what they think?
- I'm nervous to do it.

847
01:18:10,400 --> 01:18:13,370
I'm nervous to get up on a stage
and perform for people...

848
01:18:13,440 --> 01:18:14,856
I mean, I don't need
to say that to you.

849
01:18:14,880 --> 01:18:18,487
- It's gonna be incredible.
- You don't get it, but I'm terrified.

850
01:18:18,560 --> 01:18:22,485
They should be so lucky to see it.
I can't wait.

851
01:18:22,560 --> 01:18:24,050
I can.

852
01:18:26,240 --> 01:18:27,480
When do you leave,
the morning?

853
01:18:27,560 --> 01:18:30,723
Yeah. 6:45.

854
01:18:30,800 --> 01:18:31,847
- Ooh.
- Boise.

855
01:18:32,840 --> 01:18:34,922
- Boy-he?
- Boyden.

856
01:18:35,000 --> 01:18:36,650
To Boise!

857
01:18:39,520 --> 01:18:40,885
You should come.

858
01:18:42,320 --> 01:18:43,560
To Boise?

859
01:18:43,640 --> 01:18:45,376
Yeah, you can knock that
off your bucket list.

860
01:18:45,400 --> 01:18:49,405
Oh, that would be... really exciting.
I wish I could.

861
01:18:49,480 --> 01:18:50,840
What are you doing after the tour?

862
01:18:52,240 --> 01:18:53,571
Why can't you?

863
01:18:53,640 --> 01:18:54,801
- Come to Boise?
- Yeah.

864
01:18:54,880 --> 01:18:56,325
'Cause I have to rehearse.

865
01:18:56,400 --> 01:18:58,402
But can't you rehearse anywhere?

866
01:19:02,200 --> 01:19:04,487
Anywhere you are?

867
01:19:04,560 --> 01:19:06,403
I mean, I guess.

868
01:19:07,400 --> 01:19:10,882
Um... all my stuff is here,
and it's in two weeks,

869
01:19:10,960 --> 01:19:13,725
So I don't really think
that would be...

870
01:19:13,800 --> 01:19:18,169
- Okay. Well.
- ...the best idea right now, but...

871
01:19:18,240 --> 01:19:20,447
I wish I could.

872
01:19:20,520 --> 01:19:23,683
We're just gonna have to try and see
each other. We never see each other.

873
01:19:23,760 --> 01:19:26,286
I know, but when are you done?

874
01:19:26,360 --> 01:19:29,204
What do you mean? I mean...

875
01:19:29,280 --> 01:19:31,362
When are you finished
with the whole tour?

876
01:19:31,440 --> 01:19:35,331
After we finish, we're gonna go
and record, and then we go back on tour.

877
01:19:35,400 --> 01:19:36,896
You know, we tour so we can
make the record,

878
01:19:36,920 --> 01:19:39,207
so we can go back
and tour the record.

879
01:19:42,960 --> 01:19:45,930
So it's like the long haul?

880
01:19:48,400 --> 01:19:50,289
What do you mean,
"the long haul"?

881
01:19:50,360 --> 01:19:54,649
I mean the long haul, like you're gonna
stay in this band for a long time.

882
01:19:56,000 --> 01:19:57,411
On tour.

883
01:19:59,320 --> 01:20:00,924
What did you think I was gonna do?

884
01:20:01,000 --> 01:20:05,210
I don't... I hadn't really thought it
through. I didn't know that the band...

885
01:20:07,040 --> 01:20:09,600
- ...was so important.
- You didn't think it would be successful?

886
01:20:10,000 --> 01:20:12,765
Um...

887
01:20:12,840 --> 01:20:15,525
No, that's not really what I mean.
I just mean that you...

888
01:20:15,600 --> 01:20:19,321
You're gonna be on tour for,
what, months now? Years?

889
01:20:19,400 --> 01:20:20,970
Yeah. I don't believe...
This is it.

890
01:20:21,040 --> 01:20:23,441
I mean, it could easily be...

891
01:20:23,520 --> 01:20:26,251
I could be on tour with this
for a couple of years, at least.

892
01:20:26,320 --> 01:20:28,527
Just this record.

893
01:20:28,600 --> 01:20:31,365
Do you like the music you're playing?

894
01:20:33,040 --> 01:20:35,008
I don't...

895
01:20:35,080 --> 01:20:38,687
I don't know what it matters.

896
01:20:38,760 --> 01:20:41,843
Well, it matters, because if you're gonna
give up your dream,

897
01:20:41,920 --> 01:20:46,847
I think it matters that you like
what you're playing on the road for years.

898
01:20:49,440 --> 01:20:50,851
Do you like the music
I'm playing?

899
01:20:50,920 --> 01:20:54,891
Yeah. I do.

900
01:20:54,960 --> 01:20:57,327
I just didn't think that you did.

901
01:20:57,400 --> 01:20:59,801
- Yeah, well...
- You always said Keith is the worst,

902
01:20:59,880 --> 01:21:03,009
and now you're gonna be on tour with him
for years, so I just didn't...

903
01:21:03,080 --> 01:21:04,616
- What are you doing right now?
- ...know if you were happy.

904
01:21:04,640 --> 01:21:05,736
- Why are you doing this?
- I don't...

905
01:21:05,760 --> 01:21:07,976
- What do you mean, why am I doing this?
- I thought you wanted me to do this.

906
01:21:08,000 --> 01:21:09,816
It just sounds like now
you don't want me to do it.

907
01:21:09,840 --> 01:21:12,320
What do you mean,
I wanted you to do this?

908
01:21:12,400 --> 01:21:14,528
This is what you wanted for me.

909
01:21:14,640 --> 01:21:15,687
To be in this band?

910
01:21:15,760 --> 01:21:18,491
To be in a band.
To have a steady job, you know?

911
01:21:18,600 --> 01:21:21,922
To be... You know.

912
01:21:22,000 --> 01:21:23,968
Of course I wanted you
to have a steady job,

913
01:21:24,040 --> 01:21:26,056
so that you could take care of yourself
and your life

914
01:21:26,080 --> 01:21:27,366
and you could start your club.

915
01:21:27,440 --> 01:21:29,856
So I'm doing that, so I don't understand.
Why aren't we celebrating?

916
01:21:29,880 --> 01:21:31,803
Why aren't you starting your club?

917
01:21:31,880 --> 01:21:34,406
You said yourself no one
wants to go to that club.

918
01:21:34,480 --> 01:21:36,576
No one wants to go to a club
called "Chicken on a Stick."

919
01:21:36,600 --> 01:21:37,681
So change the name!

920
01:21:37,760 --> 01:21:39,922
Well, no one likes jazz!
Not even you!

921
01:21:40,040 --> 01:21:41,849
I do like jazz now because of you!

922
01:21:41,920 --> 01:21:44,366
And this is what I thought
you wanted me to do!

923
01:21:44,440 --> 01:21:47,649
What am I supposed to do?
Go back to playing "Jingle Bells"?

924
01:21:47,720 --> 01:21:48,721
I'm not saying that.

925
01:21:48,840 --> 01:21:50,016
I'm saying why don't you take
what you've made and start the club?

926
01:21:50,040 --> 01:21:52,691
Scraping pennies so I can start a club
no one wants to go to?

927
01:21:52,800 --> 01:21:55,610
People will want to go to it
because you're passionate about it,

928
01:21:55,720 --> 01:21:58,007
and people love what other people
are passionate about.

929
01:21:58,080 --> 01:22:00,600
- You remind people of what they forgot.
- Not in my experience.

930
01:22:04,120 --> 01:22:07,806
Well, whatever, all right?
It's just time to grow up, you know?

931
01:22:07,880 --> 01:22:09,962
I have a steady job,
this is what I'm doing.

932
01:22:10,040 --> 01:22:11,776
And now all of a sudden
if you had these problems,

933
01:22:11,800 --> 01:22:13,529
I wish you would have said them earlier,

934
01:22:13,600 --> 01:22:15,096
before I signed
on the goddamn dotted line!

935
01:22:15,120 --> 01:22:16,849
I'm pointing out that you had a dream

936
01:22:16,920 --> 01:22:18,736
that you followed,
that you were sticking to...

937
01:22:18,760 --> 01:22:20,888
This is the dream!
This is the dream.

938
01:22:20,960 --> 01:22:22,246
This is not your dream!

939
01:22:22,320 --> 01:22:24,561
Guys like me work their whole lives
to be in something

940
01:22:24,640 --> 01:22:27,723
that's successful, that people like.
You know?

941
01:22:27,800 --> 01:22:31,646
I mean, I'm finally in something
that-that-that people enjoy.

942
01:22:31,720 --> 01:22:33,136
Since when do you care
about being liked?

943
01:22:33,160 --> 01:22:34,736
Just 'cause I don't enjoy it,
it doesn't matter.

944
01:22:34,760 --> 01:22:36,683
Why do you care so much
about being liked?

945
01:22:36,760 --> 01:22:38,762
You're an actress!
What are you talking about?

946
01:22:56,880 --> 01:22:58,609
Maybe you just liked me
when I was on my ass

947
01:22:58,680 --> 01:23:00,762
'cause it made you
feel better about yourself.

948
01:23:05,560 --> 01:23:07,801
- Are you kidding?
- No.

949
01:23:28,880 --> 01:23:30,120
I don't know.

950
01:24:50,480 --> 01:24:52,847
Okay, fellas.
I'll see ya tomorrow.

951
01:24:52,920 --> 01:24:54,160
- Sebastian?
- Yeah?

952
01:24:54,240 --> 01:24:56,925
You're good for tonight, right?

953
01:24:57,000 --> 01:24:58,525
What are you talking about?

954
01:24:58,600 --> 01:25:01,171
7:00, the photo shoot.

955
01:25:01,280 --> 01:25:03,521
<i>Mojo.</i> Are you good?

956
01:25:06,200 --> 01:25:09,602
- I thought that was next Thursday.
- No, it's tonight.

957
01:25:12,200 --> 01:25:13,645
Is that okay?

958
01:26:10,040 --> 01:26:12,016
- Give me the other camera!
- What's wrong with that one?

959
01:26:12,040 --> 01:26:15,487
"What's wrong with that one?" It doesn't
bloody work, that's what's wrong with it!

960
01:26:15,560 --> 01:26:17,244
All right, trumpet,
that's lovely.

961
01:26:18,680 --> 01:26:21,923
Lovely! Beautiful, beautiful!

962
01:26:22,000 --> 01:26:24,287
Okay, keyboard.
Okay, look up.

963
01:26:24,360 --> 01:26:27,364
That's good. That's good,
that's lovely. Lovely.

964
01:26:27,440 --> 01:26:31,286
Okay, cut the music!
That is lovely. That's lovely.

965
01:26:31,360 --> 01:26:35,160
Okay, now bite your lip
like this, sort of like...

966
01:26:35,240 --> 01:26:38,881
like you're concentrating on something,
I don't know, like a piece of your music.

967
01:26:38,960 --> 01:26:40,200
Bite my what?

968
01:26:40,280 --> 01:26:42,169
Your lip. You know,
bite your lip...

969
01:26:43,280 --> 01:26:46,045
Yeah, that's good.
That's great.

970
01:26:46,120 --> 01:26:47,360
Beautiful! Beautiful.

971
01:26:47,440 --> 01:26:50,728
Okay, now just move your glasses
down on... onto the nose...

972
01:26:50,800 --> 01:26:53,406
A little bit further, just a little bit,
a touch further.

973
01:26:53,520 --> 01:26:55,727
Keep your head down,
but look up at me.

974
01:26:55,800 --> 01:26:57,484
Look sort of moody.

975
01:26:57,560 --> 01:27:00,166
Yeah! That's beautiful!
That is great!

976
01:27:00,240 --> 01:27:03,289
Okay, turn the keyboard on live!

977
01:27:03,360 --> 01:27:04,736
Do you wanna hear
the keyboard then?

978
01:27:04,760 --> 01:27:07,411
You don't have to bite your lip now.

979
01:27:07,480 --> 01:27:09,926
Well, actually play something.

980
01:27:10,000 --> 01:27:12,128
Play something.
You know? Anything.

981
01:27:12,200 --> 01:27:14,931
You're a pianist, aren't you?
Play something.

982
01:27:26,280 --> 01:27:29,170
That's great, that's beautiful.

983
01:27:29,240 --> 01:27:31,083
That's lovely.
Oh, that's good.

984
01:27:31,160 --> 01:27:33,208
No, don't stop.
Keep playing.

985
01:27:33,280 --> 01:27:35,931
Go on, just keep playing.
That was great!

986
01:28:15,640 --> 01:28:19,087
...shoot myself in the head.

987
01:28:19,160 --> 01:28:20,730
She's not even good.

988
01:28:20,800 --> 01:28:22,450
That whole window thing...

989
01:28:22,520 --> 01:28:24,921
Yeah, what was
that shit with the window?

990
01:28:25,000 --> 01:28:27,651
Oh, my God!
Don't quit your day job.

991
01:28:27,720 --> 01:28:29,563
Oh, well...

992
01:28:29,640 --> 01:28:32,530
Not good. One-woman shows
are always terrible.

993
01:28:55,800 --> 01:28:57,040
Mia!

994
01:28:59,040 --> 01:29:01,725
Mia. I'm so sorry.

995
01:29:04,040 --> 01:29:06,611
Just tell me how it went.
How was it?

996
01:29:06,680 --> 01:29:09,126
- Don't help me.
- I'm sorry.

997
01:29:09,200 --> 01:29:11,616
- I'm sorry I've been such a prick.
- You're sorry, you're sorry...

998
01:29:11,640 --> 01:29:14,405
You're sorry. You're sorry...

999
01:29:14,480 --> 01:29:18,326
I'm gonna make it up to you.
Let me make it up to you, okay?

1000
01:29:24,440 --> 01:29:27,922
- I don't blame you for not wanting...
- It's over.

1001
01:29:28,000 --> 01:29:30,002
- What is?
- It's over.

1002
01:29:30,080 --> 01:29:31,411
What?

1003
01:29:33,240 --> 01:29:34,765
All of this.

1004
01:29:34,840 --> 01:29:38,401
I'm done embarrassing myself.
I'm done, I'm done.

1005
01:29:39,440 --> 01:29:41,169
- Nobody showed up.
- So what? So what?

1006
01:29:41,240 --> 01:29:43,686
I can't pay back the theater.
This is so...

1007
01:29:45,040 --> 01:29:46,849
I'm gonna go home for a while.

1008
01:29:46,920 --> 01:29:50,686
- I'll come see you tomorrow.
- No, I'm going "home" home.

1009
01:29:50,760 --> 01:29:53,366
- This is home.
- No, it's not anymore.

1010
01:32:08,760 --> 01:32:10,046
Yep?

1011
01:32:10,120 --> 01:32:11,760
<i>Hi, I'm trying to reach Mia Dolan.</i>

1012
01:32:13,000 --> 01:32:14,240
Wrong number.

1013
01:32:14,320 --> 01:32:16,891
<i>She's not answering her cell.
I was told I might find her here.</i>

1014
01:32:16,960 --> 01:32:18,200
Not anymore.

1015
01:32:18,280 --> 01:32:20,442
<i>- Okay, well, if you do talk to her...</i>
- I won't.

1016
01:32:20,520 --> 01:32:24,047
<i>...could you tell her Jane at Amy Brandt
Casting is trying to reach her?</i>

1017
01:32:29,720 --> 01:32:30,960
Casting?

1018
01:32:39,520 --> 01:32:40,851
Who the hell is that?

1019
01:32:46,480 --> 01:32:47,720
Shut that thing off!

1020
01:32:58,440 --> 01:32:59,680
<i>Why did you come here?</i>

1021
01:32:59,800 --> 01:33:02,041
- Because I have good news.
- What?

1022
01:33:02,120 --> 01:33:05,761
Amy Brandt,
the casting director?

1023
01:33:05,840 --> 01:33:09,208
- Yeah.
- She was at your play, and she loved it.

1024
01:33:09,280 --> 01:33:13,205
And she loved it so much that she wants
you to come in tomorrow

1025
01:33:13,280 --> 01:33:15,965
and audition for this huge movie
that she's got.

1026
01:33:18,120 --> 01:33:19,610
I'm not going to that.

1027
01:33:21,840 --> 01:33:23,016
- I'm not going to that.
- What?

1028
01:33:23,040 --> 01:33:25,771
That one's gonna be...
No. That one's gonna be...

1029
01:33:25,840 --> 01:33:27,126
I'm sorry?

1030
01:33:27,200 --> 01:33:29,043
That will kill me.

1031
01:33:30,520 --> 01:33:31,965
- What?!
- What?

1032
01:33:32,040 --> 01:33:33,849
What? Shh! Stop!

1033
01:33:33,960 --> 01:33:35,405
No!

1034
01:33:35,480 --> 01:33:37,608
You have to be quiet.
We're in a neighborhood.

1035
01:33:37,680 --> 01:33:39,856
If you want me to be quiet,
you have to make some goddamn sense!

1036
01:33:39,880 --> 01:33:41,176
- Tell me why you're not going.
- They'll call the police.

1037
01:33:41,200 --> 01:33:42,280
- Because. Because...
- Why?

1038
01:33:42,320 --> 01:33:45,056
I've been to a million auditions,
and the same thing happens every time

1039
01:33:45,080 --> 01:33:47,924
where I get interrupted because someone
wants to get a sandwich!

1040
01:33:48,000 --> 01:33:50,651
Or I'm crying,
and they start laughing!

1041
01:33:50,720 --> 01:33:52,768
Or there's people
sitting in the waiting room,

1042
01:33:52,840 --> 01:33:57,050
and they're like me, but prettier
and better at the...

1043
01:33:57,120 --> 01:33:58,770
Because maybe
I'm not good enough!

1044
01:33:58,840 --> 01:34:01,127
- Yes, you are.
- No...

1045
01:34:01,200 --> 01:34:02,770
- No, maybe I'm not.
- Yes, you are.

1046
01:34:02,840 --> 01:34:05,650
- Maybe I'm not.
- You are.

1047
01:34:08,040 --> 01:34:11,806
Maybe I'm one of those people
that has always wanted to do it,

1048
01:34:11,880 --> 01:34:15,123
but it's like a pipe dream for me,
you know?

1049
01:34:15,200 --> 01:34:16,645
And then, you said it,

1050
01:34:16,720 --> 01:34:19,564
you change your dreams,
and then you grow up.

1051
01:34:19,640 --> 01:34:21,847
Maybe I'm one of those people,
and I'm not supposed to.

1052
01:34:21,920 --> 01:34:23,968
And I can go back to school,

1053
01:34:24,040 --> 01:34:26,168
and I can find something else
I'm supposed to do.

1054
01:34:26,240 --> 01:34:30,245
'Cause I left to do that,
and it's been six years,

1055
01:34:30,320 --> 01:34:31,924
and I don't want to do it anymore.

1056
01:34:35,640 --> 01:34:36,880
Why?

1057
01:34:39,160 --> 01:34:42,084
- Why what?
- Why don't you want to do it anymore?

1058
01:34:44,160 --> 01:34:47,050
'Cause I think it hurts
a little bit too much.

1059
01:34:48,880 --> 01:34:50,166
You're a baby.

1060
01:34:51,600 --> 01:34:53,176
- I'm not a baby. I'm trying to grow up.
- You are.

1061
01:34:53,200 --> 01:34:54,816
- You're crying like a baby.
- Oh, my God.

1062
01:34:54,840 --> 01:34:57,969
You have an audition tomorrow at 5:30.

1063
01:34:58,040 --> 01:35:00,725
I'll be out front at 8:00 A.M.

1064
01:35:00,840 --> 01:35:03,207
You'll be out front or not,
I don't know.

1065
01:35:04,840 --> 01:35:06,365
How'd you find me here?

1066
01:35:06,440 --> 01:35:09,444
The house
in front of the library.

1067
01:35:30,200 --> 01:35:32,202
♪♪

1068
01:35:52,720 --> 01:35:54,722
- I got coffee.
- Okay, great.

1069
01:36:12,800 --> 01:36:14,086
Mia?

1070
01:36:20,160 --> 01:36:22,367
Hi, Mia. I'm Amy
and this is Frank.

1071
01:36:22,440 --> 01:36:23,726
Hi. How are ya?

1072
01:36:23,840 --> 01:36:26,081
- Nice to meet you.
- Glad we found you.

1073
01:36:26,160 --> 01:36:27,605
Me, too.

1074
01:36:28,600 --> 01:36:33,891
The film shoots in Paris,
and we don't have a script.

1075
01:36:33,960 --> 01:36:35,450
It's gonna be a process.

1076
01:36:35,560 --> 01:36:37,608
We're gonna build the character
around the actress.

1077
01:36:37,680 --> 01:36:40,331
It's a 3-month rehearsal
and a 4-month shoot.

1078
01:36:42,320 --> 01:36:44,084
Okay.

1079
01:36:44,160 --> 01:36:47,721
And we thought that you
could just tell us a story.

1080
01:36:47,800 --> 01:36:49,040
About?

1081
01:36:49,120 --> 01:36:52,806
- You can just tell us anything.
- Anything?

1082
01:36:52,880 --> 01:36:55,690
Yeah, just tell us a story.
You're a storyteller.

1083
01:36:55,760 --> 01:36:57,888
um...

1084
01:37:01,040 --> 01:37:03,042
Whenever you're ready.

1085
01:37:12,880 --> 01:37:15,087
My aunt used to live in Paris.

1086
01:37:19,840 --> 01:37:21,120
I remember she used to come home

1087
01:37:21,160 --> 01:37:26,451
and she would tell us these stories
about being abroad, and...

1088
01:37:28,840 --> 01:37:30,080
I remember...

1089
01:37:31,400 --> 01:37:34,609

Oh, they said the next couple days.

1134
01:41:23,120 --> 01:41:25,521
But I'm not expecting
to find anything out.

1135
01:41:25,640 --> 01:41:26,880
You're gonna get it.

1136
01:41:26,960 --> 01:41:28,336
- I really might not.
- Yes, you are.

1137
01:41:28,360 --> 01:41:31,045
- I hope you're not disappointed.
- I know.

1138
01:41:31,120 --> 01:41:33,771
I know.
I know these things.

1139
01:41:35,840 --> 01:41:37,080
Where are we?

1140
01:41:40,720 --> 01:41:43,610
- Griffith Park.
<i>- Where... are we?</i>

1141
01:41:43,680 --> 01:41:46,809
I know.

1142
01:41:46,880 --> 01:41:48,564
I don't know.

1143
01:41:51,280 --> 01:41:53,169
What do we do?

1144
01:41:53,240 --> 01:41:56,210
I don't think
we can do anything,

1145
01:41:56,280 --> 01:41:59,204
- 'cause when you get this...
- If I get this.

1146
01:41:59,280 --> 01:42:04,081
When you get this, you gotta give it
everything you got.

1147
01:42:05,960 --> 01:42:07,200
Everything.

1148
01:42:08,200 --> 01:42:09,929
It's your dream.

1149
01:42:10,000 --> 01:42:11,968
What are you gonna do?

1150
01:42:12,040 --> 01:42:13,929
I gotta follow
my own plan, you know?

1151
01:42:14,000 --> 01:42:16,082
Stay here
and get my own thing goin'.

1152
01:42:22,160 --> 01:42:26,449
You're gonna be in Paris.
Good jazz there.

1153
01:42:26,520 --> 01:42:31,367
And you love jazz now.
Right?

1154
01:42:33,080 --> 01:42:34,320
Yes.

1155
01:42:43,680 --> 01:42:46,001
And I guess we're just gonna
have to wait and see.

1156
01:42:55,040 --> 01:42:56,883
I'm always gonna love you.

1157
01:42:58,560 --> 01:43:00,164
I'm always gonna love you, too.

1158
01:43:08,280 --> 01:43:10,282
Look at this view!

1159
01:43:11,640 --> 01:43:14,211
- I've seen better. Yeah.
- It's the worst.

1160
01:43:18,560 --> 01:43:20,562
I've never been here
during the day.

1161
01:44:13,160 --> 01:44:14,776
Hi. Could I have
two iced coffees, please?

1162
01:44:14,800 --> 01:44:17,280
- Right. Of course.
- On us.

1163
01:44:17,360 --> 01:44:19,283
Oh, no, thank you, I insist.

1164
01:44:49,400 --> 01:44:53,246
Sounds good.
Harris did a good job.

1165
01:44:53,320 --> 01:44:55,891
- Took him long enough.
- It always does.

1166
01:44:55,960 --> 01:44:57,405
Signature time.

1167
01:44:59,680 --> 01:45:01,648
Not doin' too bad, Seb.

1168
01:45:01,720 --> 01:45:04,610
- "Not too bad" is great.
- See ya tonight.

1169
01:45:04,680 --> 01:45:06,011
See ya tonight.

1170
01:45:26,560 --> 01:45:28,130
Hi.

1171
01:45:28,200 --> 01:45:30,282
- How was your day?
