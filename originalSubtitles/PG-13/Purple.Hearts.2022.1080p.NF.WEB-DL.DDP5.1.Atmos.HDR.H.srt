00:00:58,916 --> 00:01:01,666
remember, the decisions you make
have lasting consequences.

My name is Cassie, and we are The Loyal.

55
00:03:26,833 --> 00:03:29,458
Dude, that was your request.

56
00:03:29,541 --> 00:03:31,041
And give it up for Billy,

57
00:03:31,125 --> 00:03:33,416
the owner who apparently really meant it

58
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:35,250

59
00:03:35,333 --> 00:03:37,213
Oh, and please don't forget
to tip your servers,

60
00:03:37,250 --> 00:03:40,000
'cause, PS, we're also your servers.

61
00:03:40,083 --> 00:03:41,583
Great job!

62
00:03:42,125 --> 00:03:43,958
Oh my God,
that was such a good set.

63
00:03:44,041 --> 00:03:46,250
- Bye, guys. That was awesome.
- See you tomorrow.

64
00:03:46,333 --> 00:03:49,791
Look, Cassie, it's your faves.

65

00:03:53,166 --> 00:03:55,208
Oh, great. Marines.

- Cass!
- No. Frankie?

70
00:04:04,291 --> 00:04:05,625
- Cass?
- Stop.

71
00:04:05,708 --> 00:04:07,375
- Hey!
- Frankie!

72
00:04:08,833 --> 00:04:09,916
Surprise!

73
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,059
- I missed you, you freak.
- I missed you too, Salazar.

74
00:04:12,083 --> 00:04:15,708
Oh my God. Look at the buzz.
No, I'm not okay with this at all.

75
00:04:15,791 --> 00:04:18,958
- Uh, Nora, Frankie. Frankie, Nora.
- Nice to meet you.

76
00:04:19,041 --> 00:04:21,958
Nora, they're in The Loyal with me.
Frankie, we grew up together,

77
00:04:22,041 --> 00:04:23,958
and I was his babysitter.

78
00:04:24,041 --> 00:04:25,083
Okay. Okay.

79
00:04:25,166 --> 00:04:28,166
- Don't say that in front of everybody.
- Baby-faced Frankie.

80
00:04:28,250 --> 00:04:30,050
You see what you did?

81
00:04:30,125 --> 00:04:32,916
Cassie was just telling me
how much she loves military boys.

82
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,041
- Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Mmm.

83
00:04:35,125 --> 00:04:38,045
Uh, these are the guys.
We've two weeks 'til we ship out to Iraq.

84
00:04:38,125 --> 00:04:40,226
- We're still in Iraq?
- Not out yet.

85
00:04:40,250 --> 00:04:43,083
Another war that never ends.
In that case, what you guys wanna drink?

86
00:04:43,166 --> 00:04:44,750
- First one's on the house.
- Thank you.

87
00:04:44,833 --> 00:04:46,083
- Hey!
- Tequila?

88
00:04:46,166 --> 00:04:48,958
- Does he look old enough to drink tequila?
- Absolutely not.

89
00:04:49,041 --> 00:04:50,392
- Double that.
- Copy that.

90
00:04:50,416 --> 00:04:52,291
- I'll have a Coke.
- Mmm. Okay.

91
00:04:52,375 --> 00:04:54,166
- My kinda guy.
- Hell, yeah.

92
00:04:54,250 --> 00:04:56,166
Could you throw in
some lemon slices with that?

93
00:04:56,250 --> 00:04:58,375
How about you pace yourself, bro?

94
00:04:59,791 --> 00:05:01,208
Whoa!

95
00:05:01,291 --> 00:05:02,958
She's into you, bro.

96
00:05:05,458 --> 00:05:06,458
No.

97
00:05:06,916 --> 00:05:09,583
Okay? Just no.
It's not gonna happen, never.

98
00:05:09,666 --> 00:05:11,041
Just let it go, cheekbones.

99
00:05:11,625 --> 00:05:14,708
- What? You two?
- No, she's like an older sister to me.

100
00:05:14,791 --> 00:05:16,791
Uh, Cassie has
a "no soldiers" policy, sorry.

101
00:05:16,875 --> 00:05:19,125
- We're marines.
- What's that about?

102
00:05:19,208 --> 00:05:21,434
- Well, that means more of us for you then.
- Oh.

103
00:05:21,458 --> 00:05:22,958
Tempting.

104
00:05:23,041 --> 00:05:24,892
Let me check with my girlfriend.

105
00:05:24,916 --> 00:05:27,000
Uh, three tequilas and a coke.

106
00:05:27,083 --> 00:05:30,083
So we're good enough to fight
for your ass, but not enough to touch it?

107
00:05:30,166 --> 00:05:32,000
- Excuse me?
- Okay.

108
00:05:32,083 --> 00:05:34,541
I'll excuse you, this time.

109
00:05:34,625 --> 00:05:36,625
I can't with this.

110
00:05:36,708 --> 00:05:39,208
- Real smooth.
- What the hell? Come on. Bro.

111
00:05:41,541 --> 00:05:42,750
Let me see what I can do.

112
00:05:42,833 --> 00:05:45,184
Good luck, behave yourself.
Don't do what he did.

113
00:05:45,208 --> 00:05:47,166
Dude has
a perfect track record.

114
00:05:52,166 --> 00:05:56,375
Hey, I just wanted to apologize
for our friend. He's a bit...

115
00:05:57,875 --> 00:05:59,666
Okay.

116
00:05:59,750 --> 00:06:02,541
Uh, I'm Luke, by the way.
What's your name?

117
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,208
Your waitress/bartender.
Have a fun night, Luke.

118
00:06:11,541 --> 00:06:14,166
- You know, we're not all alike.
- Oh, really?

119
00:06:14,250 --> 00:06:15,250
Yeah.

120
00:06:15,333 --> 00:06:18,333
Because your friend is talking
about his right to touch my ass.

121
00:06:18,416 --> 00:06:20,875
Which apparently,
you also feel entitled to.

122
00:06:20,958 --> 00:06:23,375
Okay, we're just blowing off some steam.

123
00:06:23,458 --> 00:06:25,583
It's, uh...
It's actually a pretty big night.

124
00:06:25,666 --> 00:06:28,208
Last night on leave.
We ship off in a few weeks.

125
00:06:28,291 --> 00:06:31,958
I get it, but, uh, not really
an excuse for casual misogyny though.

126
00:06:32,041 --> 00:06:34,250
You're cute and everything, but...

127
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:37,916
Okay, all right. I, uh... I get this.

128
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,125
What do you get?

129
00:06:39,208 --> 00:06:40,750
You. Yeah.

130
00:06:40,833 --> 00:06:41,666
- Me?
- Yeah, yeah.

131
00:06:41,750 --> 00:06:45,208
You're kind of predictable.
I've... I've met your type before. Yeah.

132
00:06:45,291 --> 00:06:46,791
Oh. Do tell.

133
00:06:46,875 --> 00:06:50,958
Drive a Lexus that your parents paid for,
but it's a hybrid, so it's okay.

134
00:06:51,041 --> 00:06:53,625
You... You probably tweet a lot
about other people's rights,

135
00:06:53,708 --> 00:06:54,916
but when it comes down...

136
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:58,375
Sorry, it's just fascinating to me.
Do you have a PhD in mansplaining?

137
00:06:58,458 --> 00:07:00,684
When it actually comes down
to fighting for these rights,

138
00:07:00,708 --> 00:07:03,833
you don't wanna do anything, right?
'Cause guns are mean. You're a pacifist.

139
00:07:03,916 --> 00:07:07,750
I guess it's our job to go off
and fight those battles for you, right?

140
00:07:08,458 --> 00:07:11,500
I bet you have a little "peace-dove"
tattoo on your back to prove it.

141
00:07:11,583 --> 00:07:14,750
On my ass, actually.
Which you can't touch, but you can kiss.

142
00:07:15,541 --> 00:07:17,875
Nailed it.

143
00:07:17,958 --> 00:07:19,958
She's a pistol.

144
00:07:20,041 --> 00:07:22,583
Or they'll skip straight to chaotic evil.

145
00:07:22,666 --> 00:07:24,226
Come back.

146
00:07:24,250 --> 00:07:26,458
You see the guy
that looks like he's 12 years old?

147
00:07:26,541 --> 00:07:28,666
He told me that I should reconsider
my stance on men,

148
00:07:28,750 --> 00:07:32,000
because if I marry him,
I would get incredible health insurance.

149
00:07:32,083 --> 00:07:34,125
Wow. Health insurance.

150
00:07:34,208 --> 00:07:36,541
- That's some dirty talk right there.
- So hot.

151
00:07:38,541 --> 00:07:41,601
- Where's that coming from?
- Mine. Made it annoying to not ignore it.

152
00:07:41,625 --> 00:07:42,625
Yes.

153
00:07:45,916 --> 00:07:47,750
Uh, hey, can you cover me for, like, five?

154
00:07:47,833 --> 00:07:50,125
- Yeah. You okay?
- You know.

155
00:08:27,666 --> 00:08:29,208
Shit.

156
00:08:43,875 --> 00:08:45,726
<i>Oh, it looks like</i>

157
00:08:45,750 --> 00:08:49,333
I can't refill your prescription
for another four days.

158
00:08:51,083 --> 00:08:52,541
Uh, okay. Uh...

159
00:08:53,791 --> 00:08:56,416
I... I can't really wait four days. Um...

160
00:08:57,208 --> 00:09:01,125
Look, I'm out of my long-acting
and my short-acting insulin,

161
00:09:01,208 --> 00:09:04,166
and my reserve vial is basically gone,

162
00:09:04,250 --> 00:09:07,458
and it's just... it's really dangerous
for me not to have this.

163
00:09:07,541 --> 00:09:10,583
I mean, I can give you
a refill of your prescription

164
00:09:10,666 --> 00:09:12,166
if you wanna do it out of pocket.

165
00:09:12,250 --> 00:09:13,500
I don't think you understand...

166
00:09:13,583 --> 00:09:16,666
No, your insurance
is not renewed, so I cannot refill it.

167
00:09:16,750 --> 00:09:18,809
So, if you wanna do it out of pocket,
we can do that.

168
00:09:20,541 --> 00:09:23,208
And, um... how much is that?

169
00:09:24,750 --> 00:09:28,125
Three hundred for
the long-acting, 220 for the short-acting.

170
00:09:28,208 --> 00:09:30,500
So, a little over $500.
What do you wanna do?

171
00:09:30,583 --> 00:09:32,916
- Come on.
- I'm so sorry. I'll be right with you.

172
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Ma, nothing.

173
00:09:35,083 --> 00:09:37,333
Check out in the other line.
This line already hates me.

174
00:09:37,416 --> 00:09:39,101
Do you wanna
step aside while...

175
00:09:39,125 --> 00:09:41,458
Can... you just give me a second?

176
00:09:45,833 --> 00:09:48,291
She speaks English too, thank you.

177
00:09:48,375 --> 00:09:49,208
Cassie!

178
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:53,083
You take my cash. I'll do credit.

179
00:09:55,583 --> 00:09:57,458
- Ma!
- Always health first.

180
00:10:00,458 --> 00:10:01,583
<i>Gracias.</i>

181
00:10:01,666 --> 00:10:03,166
Okay, that worked out.

182
00:10:04,791 --> 00:10:06,041
Do you wanna fill this, hon?

183
00:10:08,416 --> 00:10:09,416
Oh.

184
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:14,500
That is...

185
00:10:14,583 --> 00:10:15,458
Shoot.

186
00:10:15,541 --> 00:10:18,708
Guess I'll try
to make it to Friday without it.

187
00:10:20,416 --> 00:10:22,125
Thanks. Go Big Pharma.

188
00:10:34,875 --> 00:10:36,458
What the hell?

189
00:10:39,875 --> 00:10:41,583
Watch it!

190
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:54,916
Shit.

191
00:11:11,083 --> 00:11:13,958
Hey, hey, hey! Get out of the way, "J."

192
00:11:14,958 --> 00:11:18,166
Yo! Those were some obstacle course moves
right there, kid. Whoop!

193
00:11:18,250 --> 00:11:20,500
- What the hell, Johnno?
- So is true, huh?

194
00:11:20,583 --> 00:11:22,625
I heard you joined the Marines.

195
00:11:23,625 --> 00:11:24,708
And I was like,

196
00:11:25,208 --> 00:11:28,958
"There's no way
that dude will pass a piss test."

197
00:11:34,208 --> 00:11:35,625
Right this way, soldier.

198
00:11:37,416 --> 00:11:38,791
Hop in, bro. Let's chill.

199
00:11:38,875 --> 00:11:41,166
- I got some good shit in my car.
- Nah. I can't.

200
00:11:41,250 --> 00:11:42,583
No. I'm, uh... I'm clean now.

201
00:11:42,666 --> 00:11:45,166
- You know, I gotta...
- Be a good boy for Uncle Sam.

202
00:11:45,250 --> 00:11:47,291
Well, it seems like...

203
00:11:47,375 --> 00:11:51,500
...your life's in ship shape.
Except, uh, you owe me 15 grand.

204
00:11:52,666 --> 00:11:53,875
So, there's that.

205
00:11:55,041 --> 00:11:56,750
I need that money, bro.

206
00:11:56,833 --> 00:11:58,291
Don't worry, Johnno.

207
00:11:58,791 --> 00:12:01,166
I deploy next week.
So I'll get you something by then.

208
00:12:01,250 --> 00:12:03,458
Whew. Okay, that's good, bro. That's good.

209
00:12:03,541 --> 00:12:06,583
'Cause, uh...
'Cause if you're not good for it,

210
00:12:08,041 --> 00:12:09,791
I know where your family is.

211
00:12:10,625 --> 00:12:11,916
Arrgh!

212
00:12:19,125 --> 00:12:21,541
I'm playing with you, bro.

213
00:12:25,791 --> 00:12:27,791
See you soon.

214
00:12:29,666 --> 00:12:31,375
Shit!

215
00:12:36,958 --> 00:12:38,375
- Oh, good.
- Mm-hmm.

216
00:12:38,458 --> 00:12:41,625
- Cassie, you got a letter.
- Mom, don't open that.

217
00:12:43,250 --> 00:12:45,875
- Cass, you didn't pay your rent?
- I said don't open that.

218
00:12:47,541 --> 00:12:50,416
Your place is falling apart.
How can you live like this?

219
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:53,750
Yeah, well, I'm busy, and the little
details aren't really a priority for me.

220
00:12:53,833 --> 00:12:57,625
- You cannot not pay your rent, Cassie.
- Well, I'm paying. I'm just paying late.

221
00:12:58,333 --> 00:13:00,500
I'm giving the landlord's daughter
free piano lessons.

222
00:13:00,583 --> 00:13:02,463
They're not going
to throw me out on the street.

223
00:13:03,333 --> 00:13:05,601
Why don't you move back with me?
You can share my bedroom.

224
00:13:05,625 --> 00:13:07,375
- Ma!
- Like when you were little.

225
00:13:07,458 --> 00:13:09,291
No, I'm not 12. I can't go backwards.

226
00:13:11,083 --> 00:13:14,666
Yes, but diabetes wasn't
really in the budget, okay?

227
00:13:14,750 --> 00:13:17,083
I'm so worried. Why are you laughing?

228
00:13:20,625 --> 00:13:23,291
You're not taking this seriously.
You could die at any moment.

229
00:13:23,375 --> 00:13:25,208
Mom! I know.

230
00:13:25,291 --> 00:13:27,416
I'm fine. I'm doing everything right.

231
00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:31,375
I'm bartending,
and delivering food, and playing gigs,

232
00:13:31,458 --> 00:13:33,750
and teaching piano on my spare time.

233
00:13:33,833 --> 00:13:36,333
And I'm constantly exhausted

234
00:13:36,416 --> 00:13:39,791
and running late, and I can't sleep
because I have this medical debt

235
00:13:39,875 --> 00:13:42,208
that just grows
like some mold in a basement.

236
00:13:42,291 --> 00:13:45,833
So, please, please just be kind to me.

237
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:53,416
Okay. Fine.

238
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:54,708
Ma.

239
00:13:54,791 --> 00:13:56,291
I'm okay. I know.

240
00:13:56,375 --> 00:13:57,416
I'm sorry.

241
00:13:57,500 --> 00:13:59,791
I should be able to provide for you.

242
00:13:59,875 --> 00:14:02,708
Mommy, I love you so much.
I don't want you to worry.

243
00:14:02,791 --> 00:14:05,541
You know me.
I'm just on my own weird journey,

244
00:14:05,625 --> 00:14:07,958
and it's... it's a little bumpy, but...

245
00:14:09,250 --> 00:14:10,375
...I love it.

246
00:14:12,041 --> 00:14:13,250
Thanks.

247
00:14:13,333 --> 00:14:14,250
I'm sorry.

248
00:14:14,333 --> 00:14:15,416

Oh God.

274
00:16:02,041 --> 00:16:03,642
- Oh my gosh.
- Are you okay?

275
00:16:03,666 --> 00:16:04,500
Grab her.

276
00:16:04,583 --> 00:16:05,583
Let's go.

277
00:16:06,458 --> 00:16:07,666
You all right?

278
00:16:08,333 --> 00:16:09,375
I'm right outside.

279
00:16:09,458 --> 00:16:11,666
- Let us know if you need anything.
- Thank you.

280
00:16:31,208 --> 00:16:32,375
Oh my God.

281
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:35,625
Get it together, Cass.

282
00:16:54,541 --> 00:16:55,541
Hello?

283
00:16:56,458 --> 00:16:57,958
Frankie?

284
00:16:59,750 --> 00:17:02,708
Oh. Hello, you're not Frankie.

285
00:17:03,416 --> 00:17:07,083
So, what happens to the men in the future?
Is it a plague? Robot wars?

286
00:17:07,166 --> 00:17:09,958
Do you really wanna know?
It doesn't end well for the bros.

287
00:17:11,291 --> 00:17:12,791
Is that your car?

288
00:17:12,875 --> 00:17:14,583
My Lexus? Yeah.

289
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:17,583
- Hi. Dude, the banners.
- Come on in.

290
00:17:17,666 --> 00:17:20,427
- Your parents are so proud.
- You know my momma.

291
00:17:24,375 --> 00:17:26,083
Would you mind giving us a minute?

292
00:17:27,958 --> 00:17:29,583
- Thanks.
- Of course.

293
00:17:30,166 --> 00:17:31,166
Aw.

294
00:17:31,208 --> 00:17:34,166
Hey. Yeah, uh, Mom's going
a little crazy with the goodbyes.

295
00:17:34,250 --> 00:17:36,375
Leave's over.
We're headed to base camp today.

296
00:17:36,458 --> 00:17:38,666
- Hey, you hungry? Want something?
- No, I'm good.

297
00:17:38,750 --> 00:17:40,708
So, what's the big question, girl?

298
00:17:40,791 --> 00:17:44,000
It's, uh... It's gonna sound a little crazy.

299
00:17:44,708 --> 00:17:45,708
I'm ready.

300
00:17:46,375 --> 00:17:47,791
I was wondering...

301
00:17:49,708 --> 00:17:52,583
I was hoping
that you might marry me.

302
00:17:52,666 --> 00:17:55,750
- What?
- I'm serious.

303
00:17:58,916 --> 00:18:00,000
Are you okay?

304
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,875
Not exactly. Um...

305
00:18:04,333 --> 00:18:07,166
I found out six months ago
that I have diabetes.

306
00:18:07,250 --> 00:18:08,791
Type 1. And, uh...

307
00:18:08,875 --> 00:18:10,750
Get this. Uh, the insurance I have

308
00:18:10,833 --> 00:18:13,375
doesn't actually cover
the insulin that I need

309
00:18:14,208 --> 00:18:15,916
to like, live.

310
00:18:16,541 --> 00:18:19,166
So, I can either pay off my debt,

311
00:18:19,250 --> 00:18:21,125
or pay my rent, but I just...

312
00:18:22,208 --> 00:18:24,291
- I can't do both.
- I'm so sorry.

313
00:18:24,375 --> 00:18:27,458
And I'm like,
there's gotta be another way, right?

314
00:18:28,541 --> 00:18:30,958
Turns out there is.

315
00:18:31,041 --> 00:18:33,625
Your friend gave me the idea
when you guys came to the bar.

316
00:18:34,916 --> 00:18:36,875
Marine spouses get full health benefits.

317
00:18:36,958 --> 00:18:39,083
And we get extra pay
just for being married.

318
00:18:39,166 --> 00:18:41,125
Like basic housing allowance
and separation pay,

319
00:18:41,208 --> 00:18:42,833
which adds up to be pretty decent,

320
00:18:42,916 --> 00:18:45,875
and we could split it,
and everybody wins. What do you think?

321
00:18:47,583 --> 00:18:49,166
Take your time.

322
00:18:49,750 --> 00:18:51,000
I'm sorry.

323
00:18:51,083 --> 00:18:53,333
- My dad's a retired MP.
- Excuse me. Private discussion.

324
00:18:53,416 --> 00:18:55,583
MP is the Military Police.

325
00:18:55,666 --> 00:18:57,416
Frankie, this is a common scam.

326
00:18:57,500 --> 00:18:59,333
They kick the tires on these things,

327
00:18:59,416 --> 00:19:01,541
and if they find out
it's not real, it's fraud.

328
00:19:01,625 --> 00:19:03,916
Come on, man.
I mean, you're better than this.

329
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,416
Okay, no one asked you, so could you not?

330
00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:10,375
- And why wouldn't this be a real marriage?
- I don't know, because you're not in love?

331
00:19:10,458 --> 00:19:13,708
Uh... But we respect each other.
We're not in love, but we love each other.

332
00:19:13,791 --> 00:19:16,151
We'd be able to sleep with other people,

333
00:19:16,208 --> 00:19:18,250
which sounds like
the healthiest marriage ever.

334
00:19:18,333 --> 00:19:19,773
You'd be ripping off the government.

335
00:19:19,833 --> 00:19:21,708
- I'd be ripping off the government?
- Yeah.

336
00:19:21,791 --> 00:19:24,625
The government that made
my mom pay taxes for ten years

337
00:19:24,708 --> 00:19:27,041
before giving her the right to vote?
That government?

338
00:19:27,125 --> 00:19:28,958
So your mom was living here
illegally then?

339
00:19:29,041 --> 00:19:31,583
Don't tell me you're
a resident of Southern California

340
00:19:31,666 --> 00:19:35,208
that does not see how this state was built
off the backs of illegal immigrants.

341
00:19:35,291 --> 00:19:38,625
Like my mom, who crossed that border,
lived here for ten years,

342
00:19:38,708 --> 00:19:43,708
worked their asses off for ten years,
paying taxes for your government,

343
00:19:43,791 --> 00:19:45,875
and were treated like less than citizens.

344
00:19:45,958 --> 00:19:49,000
Yeah, I will proudly
rip off the government.

345
00:19:49,583 --> 00:19:51,583
You got anything else to say, Commando?

346
00:19:51,666 --> 00:19:53,416
Dude, this is a trap.

347
00:19:54,541 --> 00:19:56,916
This will not end well for you.

348
00:20:00,250 --> 00:20:02,166
- I was just trying to help.
- Mmm.

349
00:20:03,166 --> 00:20:04,416
Thanks for your help.

350
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:11,083
- Why is he even here?
- He's my bunkmate, okay?

351
00:20:12,666 --> 00:20:14,708
He's got nowhere else to stay
while we are on leave.

352
00:20:14,791 --> 00:20:16,000
Please play nice.

353
00:20:18,125 --> 00:20:19,125
So?

354
00:20:20,125 --> 00:20:21,208
Cass, I can't.

355
00:20:22,750 --> 00:20:24,291
Okay? I'm... I'm sorry.

356
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:29,333
Plus, I don't think my girlfriend's
gonna understand me having a wife.

357
00:20:30,041 --> 00:20:31,833
What? You got back together with Riley?

358
00:20:33,041 --> 00:20:35,750
Yeah. Yeah. I'm... I'm all in.

359
00:20:35,833 --> 00:20:38,291
I remember when you met her,
like, in fifth grade.

360
00:20:38,875 --> 00:20:39,875
That's great.

361
00:20:42,708 --> 00:20:45,208
Well, that was crazy.

362
00:20:45,291 --> 00:20:46,500
I should go.

363
00:20:47,708 --> 00:20:51,041
There are tourists to be shuttled
and food to be delivered.

364
00:20:51,125 --> 00:20:53,708
- Cass, you know if I had the money...
- No, Frankie, stop.

365
00:20:53,791 --> 00:20:54,916
I'll figure it out.

366
00:20:58,500 --> 00:21:00,708
- Stay safe, okay?
- Yeah, you too.

367
00:21:00,791 --> 00:21:01,991
Bye.

368
00:21:03,541 --> 00:21:04,708
Her parents can't help?

369
00:21:05,583 --> 00:21:06,583
Yeah, um...

370
00:21:07,250 --> 00:21:10,500
Her mom's a nursing assistant, so it's
not like there's anything extra leftover.

371
00:21:10,583 --> 00:21:13,416
Dad dipped out when she was born.
Sounds like he was a bad dude.

372
00:21:13,500 --> 00:21:15,220
That explains a lot.

373
00:21:15,250 --> 00:21:18,958
Hey! Are you trying to sneak up on me?

374
00:21:19,041 --> 00:21:20,281
Gonna make my going-away plate.

375
00:21:20,333 --> 00:21:23,041
Let's go get some food!

376
00:21:42,416 --> 00:21:44,500
Come here. Give me a kiss. Bye.

377
00:21:44,583 --> 00:21:45,666
All right, see ya.

378
00:21:47,666 --> 00:21:49,416
Bye, Grandpa.

379
00:21:55,041 --> 00:21:56,708
Love you.

380
00:22:00,500 --> 00:22:02,625
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

381
00:22:07,333 --> 00:22:10,583
Uncle Luke? What are you doing?

382
00:22:10,666 --> 00:22:12,333
- Think fast.
- Yeah, you are.

383
00:22:12,416 --> 00:22:13,500
You ready? You ready?

384
00:22:14,416 --> 00:22:15,666
Give me the ball.

385
00:22:17,458 --> 00:22:19,375
- No, me. No, me. No, me.
- Me.

386
00:22:21,458 --> 00:22:23,625
Mom, I found Uncle Luke hiding.

387
00:22:23,708 --> 00:22:25,142
- Oh my... Luke?
- Busted.

388
00:22:25,166 --> 00:22:27,375
We didn't think
we'd see you before deployment.

389
00:22:27,458 --> 00:22:30,041
- What?
- Hi, Hailey.

390
00:22:30,125 --> 00:22:32,916
Wow. It's like hugging
a tree trunk.

391
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,458
I didn't think it was possible
to get so buff in eight months.

392
00:22:35,541 --> 00:22:37,791
What do you think, Spence?
Should I join the Marines?

393
00:22:37,875 --> 00:22:40,250
- Yeah. Yes.
- Should I get all ripped like Uncle Luke?

394
00:22:40,333 --> 00:22:42,250
Yes!

395
00:22:49,083 --> 00:22:50,500
You, uh...

396
00:22:51,791 --> 00:22:54,250
You look just like Dad with that haircut.

397
00:22:55,208 --> 00:22:56,208
Gimme a hug.

398
00:22:56,916 --> 00:22:59,000
- Bring it in.
- Good to see you, man.

399
00:23:00,875 --> 00:23:02,000
Where's he been?

400
00:23:03,041 --> 00:23:05,833
You know, Dad's off for the day,
so you can breathe.

401
00:23:09,708 --> 00:23:12,875
I think he doesn't wanna see me
even more than I don't wanna see him.

402
00:23:12,958 --> 00:23:15,083
The man would have to express
some kinda emotion

403
00:23:15,166 --> 00:23:16,846
for me to know how he's feeling about you.

404
00:23:16,916 --> 00:23:19,750
- He made it clear when he cut me off.
- Come on, Luke.

405
00:23:19,833 --> 00:23:22,750
Dad had to draw the line somewhere.
You were so out of control.

406
00:23:22,833 --> 00:23:23,833
Yeah.

407
00:23:31,625 --> 00:23:32,958
What's going on, Luke?

408
00:23:38,875 --> 00:23:40,125
I owe some money.

409
00:23:45,166 --> 00:23:47,291
We've been here before, and you know...

410
00:23:48,208 --> 00:23:49,416
You know I can't help you.

411
00:23:49,500 --> 00:23:51,625
Yeah. No, no, I... I know.

412
00:23:51,708 --> 00:23:54,291
Is it that
piece of shit Johnno, again?

413
00:23:54,375 --> 00:23:57,208
- What happens if you don't pay?
- Not paying isn't an option.

414
00:23:57,750 --> 00:24:00,083
- He better not come near my family.
- I'm sorry.

415
00:24:00,166 --> 00:24:02,000
- I'm just in a bad spot.
- Mm-hmm.

416
00:24:21,416 --> 00:24:24,166
I... I just got my pay,
so this isn't everything.

417
00:24:24,750 --> 00:24:27,500
- But I'll get the rest to you soon.
- Like when?

418
00:24:28,250 --> 00:24:29,708
<i>I'm losing my patience.</i>

419
00:24:29,791 --> 00:24:31,958
<i>I waited for you
through your stupid rehab,</i>

420
00:24:32,041 --> 00:24:33,481
<i>and now you're shipping out of town,</i>

421
00:24:33,541 --> 00:24:36,875
showing up with a coupla hundred bucks
when you owe me 15 grand?

422
00:24:36,958 --> 00:24:39,875
- I think I've got a plan.
- You better explain.

423
00:24:42,375 --> 00:24:44,208
<i>Just take it easy, man.</i>

424
00:24:44,291 --> 00:24:46,625
Don't make me use this. You gotta pay me.

425
00:24:46,708 --> 00:24:48,125
Hear me out. I'm gonna pay you.

426
00:24:48,208 --> 00:24:49,708
<i>- I... I know how.
- How?</i>

427
00:24:49,791 --> 00:24:51,751
<i>I met this girl
who needs health insurance.</i>

428
00:24:51,791 --> 00:24:54,517
And if we get married, I get extra money
each month from the military.

429
00:24:54,541 --> 00:24:55,833
I'll give you my cut. Okay?

430
00:24:55,916 --> 00:24:59,041
- You sure?
- Yeah, I'm sure. It's gonna be fine.

431
00:24:59,125 --> 00:24:59,958
So be smart.

432
00:25:00,041 --> 00:25:01,375
<i>This better work.</i>

433
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:04,250
<i>Enjoy your honeymoon.</i>

434
00:25:20,541 --> 00:25:21,541
Hi.

435
00:25:21,583 --> 00:25:23,208
- Hi.
- Thanks for meeting with me.

436
00:25:23,958 --> 00:25:26,708
Is your dad in the parking lot
waiting to cuff me?

437
00:25:26,791 --> 00:25:28,333
Funny.

438
00:25:33,791 --> 00:25:35,541
You're acting kinda sus.

439
00:25:35,625 --> 00:25:38,208
Yeah. Well, if we do this, if...

440
00:25:38,291 --> 00:25:41,875
We need to be very careful.
All right? We need a story.

441
00:25:41,958 --> 00:25:44,059
You and I didn't get along
at the bar the other night.

442
00:25:44,083 --> 00:25:46,208
The others saw that, but the next night,

443
00:25:46,291 --> 00:25:50,125
I was very charming and persistent,
and I convinced you to go out with me.

444
00:25:50,208 --> 00:25:51,267
- You did?
- Mm-hmm.

445
00:25:51,291 --> 00:25:53,833
Was it hot?
When you asked me out?

446
00:25:53,916 --> 00:25:54,916
Very.

447
00:25:56,833 --> 00:25:58,976
I'm sorry. I'm just gonna
need you to explain yourself,

448
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:02,625
because a week ago you were lecturing me
on how this is fraud, so...

449
00:26:02,708 --> 00:26:06,083
- It is fraud. I don't wanna do this.
- Okay, so... don't.

450
00:26:06,166 --> 00:26:08,541
Believe me. If I had
any other choice, I wouldn't be.

451
00:26:08,625 --> 00:26:12,083
Marriage should be for love.
And where I come from, it's for life.

452
00:26:13,083 --> 00:26:15,583
Do you come from a fantasy land?

453
00:26:15,666 --> 00:26:20,083
Because, where I come from
in reality, marriage is really just

454
00:26:20,166 --> 00:26:24,041
a pointless legal arrangement
that turns lovers into enemies, so...

455
00:26:24,916 --> 00:26:27,434
- Why don't you have another choice?
- How's that your business?

456
00:26:27,458 --> 00:26:30,458
Kind of is. I am possibly
about to marry you. Why?

457
00:26:31,458 --> 00:26:33,583
I need the extra
two grand a month married guys get.

458
00:26:33,666 --> 00:26:36,208
That's it?
And I'm supposed to trust you here?

459
00:26:36,291 --> 00:26:38,875
Trust me? Okay. Look, if I can trust a lib

460
00:26:38,958 --> 00:26:41,666
who doesn't give a shit about the law
or the military, I can sure...

461
00:26:41,750 --> 00:26:44,750
I have an ethical code
that doesn't include blind obedience,

462
00:26:44,833 --> 00:26:47,833
and I desperately need this
to literally survive.

463
00:26:47,916 --> 00:26:50,166
Whereas you could be, I don't know,

464
00:26:50,250 --> 00:26:52,750
stockpiling supplies for your bro-militia.

465
00:26:52,833 --> 00:26:55,875
I'm leaving.
This was a mistake. "Bro-militia."

466
00:26:55,958 --> 00:26:58,125
- Luke. Luke.
- Liberal nut.

467
00:26:58,208 --> 00:26:59,375
What?

468
00:26:59,458 --> 00:27:01,125
Look, I don't like you.

469
00:27:01,208 --> 00:27:02,041
No shit.

470
00:27:02,125 --> 00:27:04,958
But you seem solid. So...

471
00:27:06,625 --> 00:27:08,250
I'm sorry, okay?

472
00:27:08,333 --> 00:27:09,375
Please.

473
00:27:15,208 --> 00:27:18,250
Listen. I need you to know
what you're getting yourself into.

474
00:27:18,333 --> 00:27:20,291
If we're caught, I get court-martialed.

475
00:27:20,875 --> 00:27:23,416
As in, arrested and maybe doing time.

476
00:27:23,500 --> 00:27:24,583
Okay.

477
00:27:24,666 --> 00:27:27,041
Look, this is already gonna be
a shotgun wedding.

478
00:27:27,125 --> 00:27:28,416
We're gonna be on their radar.

479
00:27:28,500 --> 00:27:31,000
So, once I get over there, to Iraq,

480
00:27:32,416 --> 00:27:35,291
we've... we've got to just, like,
set up consistent times

481
00:27:35,375 --> 00:27:36,750
where we are gonna speak, okay?

482
00:27:36,833 --> 00:27:38,892
We gotta make this look normal,
like a real marriage.

483
00:27:38,916 --> 00:27:41,958
We'd have to write some romantic emails
in case somebody reads them.

484
00:27:42,041 --> 00:27:44,291
We just have to keep it tight for my tour.

485
00:27:44,375 --> 00:27:46,250
And once I'm back here,
we file for divorce.

486
00:27:46,333 --> 00:27:49,333
And that gives you
a year of free health insurance.

487
00:27:49,416 --> 00:27:51,666
And we can split the cash down the middle.

488
00:27:51,750 --> 00:27:52,750
- Yeah?
- Great.

489
00:27:54,458 --> 00:27:58,000
And one more small thing.
I deploy Friday morning.

490
00:27:58,083 --> 00:28:00,083
We'd also have to go out with my company.

491
00:28:01,375 --> 00:28:03,500
Act like we...

492
00:28:03,583 --> 00:28:05,333
Like we like each other.

493
00:28:06,083 --> 00:28:09,083
Yeah, more than that.
Like, love each other.

494
00:28:09,666 --> 00:28:11,375
And, um...

495
00:28:13,125 --> 00:28:16,166
So, all married couples spend the night
at this motel near base.

496
00:28:16,250 --> 00:28:18,708
- It means we would have to.
- Super.

497
00:28:21,333 --> 00:28:24,666
So, are we out of "if" territory?

498
00:28:26,583 --> 00:28:27,583
Are we doing this?

499
00:28:28,416 --> 00:28:29,416
Yeah.

500
00:28:30,666 --> 00:28:31,833
Yeah, we're doing this.

501
00:28:31,916 --> 00:28:34,000
But you can't tell anybody
that doesn't need to know.

502
00:28:34,083 --> 00:28:35,208
You have to promise.

503
00:28:35,875 --> 00:28:36,958
I promise.

504
00:28:37,625 --> 00:28:38,625
In fact,

505
00:28:39,125 --> 00:28:40,375
I pinky swear.

506
00:28:41,791 --> 00:28:44,541
- No, I'm not doing that.
- We're getting married, man.

507
00:28:55,125 --> 00:28:56,125
I'll text you.

508
00:29:39,833 --> 00:29:40,916
- No.
- What?

509
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:42,375
You can't wear that.

510
00:29:42,458 --> 00:29:44,708
- Why?
- Because we're taking wedding photos.

511
00:29:44,791 --> 00:29:46,833
You have to dress a certain way.

512
00:29:46,916 --> 00:29:48,583
- Really?
- No. I'm coming up.

513
00:29:52,833 --> 00:29:55,625
There's no fluffy virgin
white wedding dress in there, Commando.

514
00:29:55,708 --> 00:29:56,583
Stop calling me that.

515
00:30:08,833 --> 00:30:10,375
Make yourself comfortable.

516
00:30:19,583 --> 00:30:20,666
Do you play?

517
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:23,583
No, it's just to impress guys.

518
00:30:23,666 --> 00:30:25,625
You impressed?

519
00:30:26,416 --> 00:30:27,583
I'm a musician.

520
00:30:27,666 --> 00:30:28,666
It's what I do.

521
00:30:28,750 --> 00:30:31,916
My band and I have been
working at it for like, five years.

522
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:33,375
That's gotta be rough.

523
00:30:33,458 --> 00:30:36,083
Rough would be punching the clock
at some soul-sucking job

524
00:30:36,166 --> 00:30:38,125
while I'm just making the rich richer.

525
00:30:38,208 --> 00:30:40,250
I'd rather hustle for my art any day.

526
00:30:44,666 --> 00:30:47,333
- Uh...
- Uh, hi.

527
00:30:49,125 --> 00:30:50,875
So, what does the tattoo say?

528
00:30:50,958 --> 00:30:53,333
"Socialism Now"?

529
00:30:53,416 --> 00:30:54,791
You're really clever.

530
00:30:54,875 --> 00:30:57,333
No, it says...

531
00:30:57,416 --> 00:31:00,916
- Someone, something, I...
- Risk nothing, gain nothing.

532
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:05,000
It's something my grandma said to my mom
when she moved to America.

533
00:31:05,791 --> 00:31:07,041
Hello, my prince.

534
00:31:07,125 --> 00:31:10,375
Today is the day that our credit scores
shall become intertwined.

535
00:31:29,750 --> 00:31:31,625
You know, you really look the part.

536
00:31:31,708 --> 00:31:34,583
- What does that mean?
- You look pretty.

537
00:31:35,083 --> 00:31:37,833
Your blushing bride.

538
00:31:38,666 --> 00:31:41,500
Ahh! You look so beautiful!
Congratulations.

539
00:31:41,583 --> 00:31:43,559
- Thank you.
- Come on, give me a hug.

540
00:31:43,583 --> 00:31:45,041
We're so proud of you.

541
00:31:45,125 --> 00:31:47,125
This is the best day of my life.

542
00:31:47,208 --> 00:31:50,083
Oh my goodness. This is so exciting.

543
00:31:56,041 --> 00:31:57,750
Hi. Thank you for coming.

544
00:31:57,833 --> 00:31:58,875
Of course.

545
00:31:59,708 --> 00:32:00,708
Oh, did you get rings?

546
00:32:01,291 --> 00:32:02,333
- Uh...
- Here.

547
00:32:08,083 --> 00:32:10,000
Oh my God, you bought a real ring?

548
00:32:10,875 --> 00:32:12,000
- Well...
- Me.

549
00:32:12,541 --> 00:32:13,541
I did.

550
00:32:14,458 --> 00:32:16,000
- What?
- I got it for Riley.

551
00:32:17,208 --> 00:32:19,625
- I've been saving up since I enlisted.
- Frankie.

552
00:32:21,791 --> 00:32:23,333
No, I can't accept this.

553
00:32:23,916 --> 00:32:26,458
I didn't wanna ask her now
and then just ship out.

554
00:32:26,541 --> 00:32:28,916
Like, I wanna be her husband.

555
00:32:29,583 --> 00:32:30,791
You know, do it right.

556
00:32:31,375 --> 00:32:34,750
And... And Mom wants me to wait 'til I'm 21,
when I get back, so, uh...

557
00:32:35,375 --> 00:32:37,000
Just keep it warm for me.

558
00:32:38,916 --> 00:32:41,000
Luke Morrow and Casandra Salazar.

559
00:32:43,458 --> 00:32:44,458
Shit.

560
00:32:59,750 --> 00:33:01,708
We are gathered here today

561
00:33:01,791 --> 00:33:04,750
to join you two together
in lawful matrimony.

562
00:33:05,333 --> 00:33:07,083
And your witness today?

563
00:33:07,166 --> 00:33:08,250
Frankie.

564
00:33:08,333 --> 00:33:10,291
That's me. How ya doing?

565
00:33:10,375 --> 00:33:12,041
- Hi, Frankie.
- Hiya.

566
00:33:12,125 --> 00:33:14,625
Luke Morrow, do you pledge
to love this woman,

567
00:33:14,708 --> 00:33:16,375
to be true and loyal to her,

568
00:33:16,458 --> 00:33:19,125
and to comfort and keep her
in sickness and in health?

569
00:33:19,708 --> 00:33:20,708
I do.

570
00:33:22,333 --> 00:33:25,166
Casandra Salazar, do you pledge
to love this man,

571
00:33:25,250 --> 00:33:27,000
to be true and loyal to him,

572
00:33:27,083 --> 00:33:30,208
and to comfort and keep him
in sickness and in health?

573
00:33:31,458 --> 00:33:32,458
I do.

574
00:33:35,125 --> 00:33:38,041
By the power vested in me
by the great State of California,

575
00:33:38,125 --> 00:33:41,208
I now pronounce you husband and wife.

576
00:33:45,750 --> 00:33:47,458
You may kiss the bride.

577
00:33:52,291 --> 00:33:53,708
Congratulations.

578
00:33:54,916 --> 00:33:58,666
Drink up, boys!
Here's to the second platoon, baby!

579
00:33:58,750 --> 00:34:01,375
Shipping out tomorrow.

580
00:34:01,458 --> 00:34:03,333
- On one!
- Click it! Get in there.

581
00:34:03,416 --> 00:34:04,333
No shit!

582
00:34:10,375 --> 00:34:11,750
- Whoo!
- Wait, wait, wait!

583
00:34:11,833 --> 00:34:14,666
- And to the newlyweds!
- Adorable.

584
00:34:14,750 --> 00:34:15,833
Ah!

585
00:34:15,916 --> 00:34:18,833
- Considering you hated each other.
- Look at you, guys.

586
00:34:18,916 --> 00:34:20,708
Thank you.

587
00:34:20,791 --> 00:34:23,625
Newlyweds!

588
00:34:23,708 --> 00:34:25,628
Dude,
I can't believe you married her,

589
00:34:25,666 --> 00:34:27,541
and you're shipping out the next day.

590
00:34:28,125 --> 00:34:29,583
How are you doing?

591
00:34:30,416 --> 00:34:32,791
You know, a-about them leaving so soon?

592
00:34:32,875 --> 00:34:36,333
I'm... kind of freaking out.

593
00:34:36,416 --> 00:34:37,875
Yeah, it's, um...

594
00:34:39,333 --> 00:34:40,791
it's extremely surreal.

595
00:34:40,875 --> 00:34:42,541
I'm gonna miss him so much.

596
00:34:42,750 --> 00:34:44,541
I know Frankie's nervous.

597
00:34:44,625 --> 00:34:48,291
So I'm trying really hard to be brave.
But he's my favorite person.

598
00:34:48,375 --> 00:34:50,875
- That's the problem.
- Oh. Uh...

599
00:34:50,958 --> 00:34:53,166
Sorry.

600
00:34:54,875 --> 00:34:56,059
I'm a mess.

601
00:34:56,083 --> 00:34:58,208
Come on, get 'em up.
I'd like to make another toast.

602
00:34:58,291 --> 00:35:01,416
This one is to life, love,

603
00:35:01,500 --> 00:35:04,625
and hunting down some goddamn Arabs, baby!

604
00:35:04,708 --> 00:35:06,333
Whoo!

605
00:35:06,916 --> 00:35:08,708
Really? Oh boy.

606
00:35:09,875 --> 00:35:10,958
Yeah!

607
00:35:13,916 --> 00:35:15,375
You got a problem with that?

608
00:35:16,916 --> 00:35:17,916
Yeah, you.

609
00:35:18,916 --> 00:35:20,750
It's just...

610
00:35:22,500 --> 00:35:25,375
Arab is an ethnicity,
and you're making it sound

611
00:35:25,458 --> 00:35:27,958
like you're hunting down
everyone of a certain ethnicity.

612
00:35:28,041 --> 00:35:30,351
- Which sounds kind of problematic.
- Yeah, Cassie.

613
00:35:30,375 --> 00:35:32,208
He gets it. He's just stirring the pot.

614
00:35:32,791 --> 00:35:35,541
Thank you
for the sensitivity training. All right?

615
00:35:35,625 --> 00:35:37,665
I'm out here serving my country.
What are you doing?

616
00:35:37,708 --> 00:35:39,750
I don't know.
Apparently, I'm telling a marine

617
00:35:39,833 --> 00:35:41,541
he shouldn't be hunting down Arabs.

618
00:35:41,625 --> 00:35:42,976
- Okay. No, no.
- Let it go.

619
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:44,800
And what exactly
would you like us to do, huh?

620
00:35:44,875 --> 00:35:46,791
Go over there and teach them pronouns?

621
00:35:50,208 --> 00:35:53,791
How about starting with knowing
who your actual enemy is,

622
00:35:53,875 --> 00:35:56,416
and not making disturbing generalizations.
How about that?

623
00:35:56,500 --> 00:35:58,208
You watch your tone. Luke, get your girl.

624
00:35:58,291 --> 00:35:59,833
- Stop.
- Excuse me?

625
00:35:59,916 --> 00:36:01,916
- He doesn't "get" me.
- Yeah, he does.

626
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:03,666
That's enough! Both of you.

627
00:36:05,208 --> 00:36:06,583
Sit down.

628
00:36:06,666 --> 00:36:08,208
Do what the man says.

629
00:36:08,791 --> 00:36:10,000
Now.

630
00:36:14,791 --> 00:36:16,791
- Thank you.
- You too, man.

631
00:36:19,875 --> 00:36:23,125
God, I just love
nuanced conversations like these.

632
00:36:34,583 --> 00:36:36,333
I should go check on my husband.

633
00:36:37,583 --> 00:36:41,916
- What the hell?
- Oh, man. Those two are fiery.

634
00:36:43,208 --> 00:36:45,458
- You're this mad, really?
- Yeah.

635
00:36:46,125 --> 00:36:47,500
You know what he meant.

636
00:36:48,083 --> 00:36:50,083
Okay, it's all bullshit bravado.

637
00:36:50,166 --> 00:36:52,250
And look, Armando is a dick.

638
00:36:52,750 --> 00:36:56,875
But I... I don't think you understand what
we're preparing ourselves to go and do.

639
00:36:56,958 --> 00:36:59,250
Is it really worth
ruining everybody's night for?

640
00:36:59,333 --> 00:37:01,173
I'm sure I wasn't the one
who ruined the night.

641
00:37:01,250 --> 00:37:03,750
I'm sure it was your friend
shouting, "Kill all Arabs."

642
00:37:03,833 --> 00:37:06,666
What, 'cause you were gonna have
the best night if he didn't say that?

643
00:37:06,750 --> 00:37:09,291
Sitting at a table
full of people you feel superior to.

644
00:37:09,375 --> 00:37:12,125
Not being a racist troll
is kinda superior though, isn't it?

645
00:37:12,208 --> 00:37:13,916
Okay, yeah, but without guys like Armando,

646
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:16,875
do you really think this country
would be safe from terrorists?

647
00:37:16,958 --> 00:37:19,666
No, look, and you preach,
"The future is female."

648
00:37:19,750 --> 00:37:21,458
How do you think those women feel in Iraq?

649
00:37:21,541 --> 00:37:22,541
You live in this bubble.

650
00:37:22,583 --> 00:37:24,458
- I can't stand it.
- No, you're right.

651
00:37:24,541 --> 00:37:28,916
Because the obvious solution is guns.
Send over a bunch of men with guns!

652
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:31,541
Wow,
they're off to a great start.

653
00:37:31,625 --> 00:37:33,505
- Perfect. Guns. What?
- They see us. Come here.

654
00:37:33,541 --> 00:37:35,458
- I said they can see us, come here.
- Okay.

655
00:37:35,541 --> 00:37:39,041
- Yeah, well, couples fight, dude...
- You are so goddamn stubborn, just...

656
00:37:46,208 --> 00:37:48,291
Working through our differences.

657
00:37:49,916 --> 00:37:51,416
Okay?

658
00:37:51,916 --> 00:37:53,541
- Still looking.
- Mm-hmm.

659
00:37:57,750 --> 00:37:58,583
Yeah.

660
00:37:58,666 --> 00:38:00,791
Keep holding me.

661
00:38:01,625 --> 00:38:02,833
So in love.

662
00:38:06,166 --> 00:38:08,833
- See? They're hugging.
- They're fine now.

663
00:38:10,791 --> 00:38:11,791
We're good.

664
00:38:12,875 --> 00:38:13,708
Yep.

665
00:38:15,666 --> 00:38:16,666
Good.

666
00:38:24,416 --> 00:38:26,583
Last night, baby!

667
00:38:26,666 --> 00:38:28,333
Ah, make it count, fellas!

668
00:38:28,416 --> 00:38:30,708
- Let's go big tonight!
- In bed! Whoo!

669
00:38:30,791 --> 00:38:31,871
I love you, girl!

670
00:38:33,458 --> 00:38:35,541
Giddy up! Giddy up!
Come on!

671
00:38:38,833 --> 00:38:40,750
- Good night.
- Night.

672
00:38:40,833 --> 00:38:42,625
Have fun in the honeymoon suite!

673
00:38:45,583 --> 00:38:47,500
Nice one.

674
00:38:50,208 --> 00:38:54,458
- Huh. I... I asked for two beds.
- Mm-hmm.

675
00:38:55,791 --> 00:38:56,958
Sure.

676
00:38:57,750 --> 00:38:58,833
Sure you did.

677
00:39:00,666 --> 00:39:03,125
All right, 'cause, what?
Y-You think I'm into you?

678
00:39:03,208 --> 00:39:04,541
Maybe a little.

679
00:39:04,625 --> 00:39:06,875
- Just breathe, dude.
- Well, 'cause I'm not.

680
00:39:06,958 --> 00:39:09,559
- All I know is you're a hot mess.
- What is that supposed to mean?

681
00:39:09,583 --> 00:39:13,250
I don't know, because a normal person
would just admit that they're scared.

682
00:39:13,333 --> 00:39:15,458
I'm not scared. I'm not scared.

683
00:39:15,541 --> 00:39:17,791
Okay. Well then,
what's with the tough guy act?

684
00:39:17,875 --> 00:39:20,541
You're bossing me around,
telling me to sit down.

685
00:39:20,625 --> 00:39:22,125
Please, stop.

686
00:39:22,208 --> 00:39:24,875
I can't do this.
I'm not doing this. Big mistake.

687
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:26,916
You're right.

688
00:39:29,500 --> 00:39:30,625
I'm scared.

689
00:39:31,250 --> 00:39:36,000
Between the marriage and Iraq,

690
00:39:36,083 --> 00:39:37,583
I'm kind of losing it.

691
00:39:41,500 --> 00:39:42,541
Uh...

692
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:47,208
I'm sorry.

693
00:39:52,208 --> 00:39:55,541
Hey, you'd be
absolutely crazy if you weren't.

694
00:39:59,375 --> 00:40:01,541
That was really brave.

695
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:16,166
I should wash up.

696
00:40:17,500 --> 00:40:18,875
Cassie...

697
00:40:39,625 --> 00:40:40,791
Is this okay?

698
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:43,041
Yes.

699
00:41:39,916 --> 00:41:42,791
- How long have you been up?
- Since 3:00 a.m.

700
00:41:42,875 --> 00:41:44,083
I went for a run.

701
00:41:44,166 --> 00:41:46,375
You went for a run
at three in the morning?

702
00:41:46,458 --> 00:41:48,625
- I couldn't sleep.
- What?

703
00:41:48,708 --> 00:41:51,166
You heard me.
I... I couldn't sleep at all.

704
00:41:51,250 --> 00:41:53,875
So, I went for a run. That's what I do.

705
00:41:55,625 --> 00:41:56,833
So, you're that guy?

706
00:41:58,416 --> 00:42:00,333
Pretend-it-didn't-happen guy.

707
00:42:00,416 --> 00:42:03,125
I don't know what you want from me.
I just have a lot on my mind.

708
00:42:03,208 --> 00:42:04,934
- Okay.
- We've gotta go to deployment.

709
00:42:04,958 --> 00:42:06,250
So I'll take you to base.

710
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:08,125
Great.

711
00:42:19,916 --> 00:42:23,333
I've lived in Oceanside my whole life,
and I've never been on base.

712
00:43:28,500 --> 00:43:30,041
Hey, I love you, man.

713
00:43:39,041 --> 00:43:40,125
I gotta go.

714
00:43:41,291 --> 00:43:44,583
Hey, Cassie, anything happens to me,
you're my next of kin, okay?

715
00:43:44,666 --> 00:43:48,083
You can call my brother.
Tell him about our deal.

716
00:43:48,166 --> 00:43:50,166
You'll have to make up a story for my dad.

717
00:43:50,250 --> 00:43:53,000
But please, my dad
cannot know about this. All right?

718
00:43:53,083 --> 00:43:53,958
Okay.

719
00:43:54,041 --> 00:43:56,001
Lance Corporal Morrow,
congratulations.

720
00:44:00,708 --> 00:44:03,375
Remember, from here on out,
we're being watched, all right?

721
00:44:03,958 --> 00:44:06,208
Emails, video calls, everything.

722
00:44:16,833 --> 00:44:19,958
NCOs, move those men. Let's go!

723
00:44:32,250 --> 00:44:34,875
Hey guys, one more time for the newlyweds!

724
00:44:34,958 --> 00:44:37,708
- Hey! Come here, girl!
- Let's get her. Let's get her.

725
00:44:37,791 --> 00:44:39,892
Come on, one last one.

726
00:44:39,916 --> 00:44:41,916
Pick her up.

727
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:43,416
Oh, oh, oh!

728
00:44:47,916 --> 00:44:49,676
Here we go.

729
00:44:49,750 --> 00:44:50,875
There we go.

730
00:44:50,958 --> 00:44:52,583
Come get your bride!

731
00:44:52,666 --> 00:44:53,916
I'm sorry.

732
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:58,166
Kiss! Kiss! Kiss! Kiss!
Kiss! Kiss! Kiss! Kiss!

733
00:44:58,250 --> 00:45:01,166
- Come on, get in there, Luke.
- Kiss! Kiss!

734
00:45:07,458 --> 00:45:09,416
That's your last one
for a long time.

735
00:45:09,500 --> 00:45:10,916
Okay.

736
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:13,250
All right, love birds.
Let's go.

737
00:45:13,333 --> 00:45:14,375
Let's move it.

738
00:45:17,500 --> 00:45:19,166
Take care of yourself, okay?

739
00:45:19,250 --> 00:45:21,531
I want a hit record
when I come back, all right?

740
00:45:21,583 --> 00:45:22,708
- Yep.
- Just for you.

741
00:45:22,791 --> 00:45:26,000
Bravo Company, on the bus! Let's move!

742
00:45:27,833 --> 00:45:29,041
Congratulations.

743
00:45:29,625 --> 00:45:30,625
Thanks.

744
00:45:39,541 --> 00:45:41,250
This doesn't even feel real.

745
00:46:32,583 --> 00:46:33,666
<i>Dear Luke.</i>

746
00:46:34,458 --> 00:46:36,375
<i>We fell in love so quickly.</i>

747
00:46:37,791 --> 00:46:39,958
<i>I figured I'd write you
and fill in the gaps</i>

748
00:46:40,041 --> 00:46:42,166
<i>that we didn't have time to fill.</i>

749
00:46:43,250 --> 00:46:44,708
<i>So...</i>

750
00:46:45,458 --> 00:46:47,375
<i>Here's what you need to know about me.</i>

751
00:46:47,458 --> 00:46:49,083
Oh!

752
00:46:50,291 --> 00:46:51,583
<i>♪ Hoping... ♪</i>

753
00:46:51,666 --> 00:46:52,833
<i>Music is...</i>

754
00:46:52,916 --> 00:46:54,750
<i>♪ Come back home... ♪</i>

755
00:46:54,833 --> 00:46:55,833
<i>...my everything.</i>

756
00:46:55,875 --> 00:46:57,416
<i>♪ Come back home ♪</i>

757
00:46:57,500 --> 00:46:59,875
<i>♪ Come back home ♪</i>

758
00:46:59,958 --> 00:47:05,041
<i>I started as a kid just singing to myself
to drown out what was going on at home.</i>

759
00:47:05,541 --> 00:47:07,666
<i>My mom had a string
of boyfriends from the base</i>

760
00:47:07,750 --> 00:47:09,708
<i>who did nothing but make her miserable.</i>

761
00:47:09,791 --> 00:47:15,083
<i>We didn't talk about it. She, uh...
She thought I didn't notice, but I did.</i>

762
00:47:15,166 --> 00:47:17,791
<i>So while most people learn
to speak their feelings out loud</i>

763
00:47:17,875 --> 00:47:22,000
<i>or write them into a journal,
I learned to make mine into music.</i>

764
00:47:22,083 --> 00:47:24,458
<i>My whole life, I've loved to sing,</i>

765
00:47:24,541 --> 00:47:28,125
<i>but I'm kind of terrified
to sing what I have to say.</i>

766
00:47:28,208 --> 00:47:29,642
...feel a squeeze.

767
00:47:30,583 --> 00:47:33,708
So I sing covers. I hide behind
someone else's words instead.

768
00:47:33,791 --> 00:47:37,291
<i>Ironic since I have been told
I'm more than opinionated.</i>

769
00:47:37,375 --> 00:47:40,750
<i>It's just every time I sit down
to write something original,</i>

770
00:47:40,833 --> 00:47:43,625
<i>making a living and all my medical
problems get in the way.</i>

771
00:47:43,708 --> 00:47:46,291
<i>Maybe that's a cop-out,
but I guess now that we're married,</i>

772
00:47:46,375 --> 00:47:47,416
<i>I'll find out.</i>

773
00:47:49,375 --> 00:47:51,916
<i>Dear Cassie,
here's what you should know about me.</i>

774
00:47:52,416 --> 00:47:54,916
<i>I'm a third-generation marine.</i>

775
00:47:55,500 --> 00:47:57,458
<i>My grandpa fought
in the battle of Iwo Jima,</i>

776
00:47:57,541 --> 00:47:59,041
<i>and my dad got a Purple Heart</i>

777
00:47:59,125 --> 00:48:01,750
<i>for being injured in combat
in Desert Storm.</i>

778
00:48:02,541 --> 00:48:05,500
<i>After high school, I kind of spun out.</i>

779
00:48:06,500 --> 00:48:09,333
<i>I thought that by enlisting,
I could earn back my dad's respect.</i>

780
00:48:09,416 --> 00:48:11,416
<i>But now, that I'm actually here,</i>

781
00:48:11,500 --> 00:48:13,541
<i>I'm starting to understand
I'm not doing it for him.</i>

782
00:48:13,625 --> 00:48:15,041
<i>I'm doing it for me.</i>

783
00:48:15,125 --> 00:48:18,166
<i>To serve my country
and to, uh, be a better man.</i>

784
00:48:20,291 --> 00:48:23,250
<i>Hey, Luke, it's your boy</i>,<i> Johnno.
I got last week's deposit.</i>

785
00:48:23,333 --> 00:48:26,291
<i>Keep faking that marriage.
That shit's crazy.</i>

786
00:48:26,375 --> 00:48:29,083
<i>Anyway, get me this week's.
Keep 'em coming.</i>

787
00:48:30,208 --> 00:48:33,083
<i>You know those freak thunderstorms
they get by the beach?</i>

788
00:48:33,166 --> 00:48:35,625
<i>They used to scare the shit out of me.</i>

789
00:48:36,750 --> 00:48:39,208
<i>My dad was a hard-ass about it,</i>

790
00:48:39,291 --> 00:48:42,333
<i>but I remember once,
he let my brother and me</i>

791
00:48:42,416 --> 00:48:45,541
<i>bring our sleeping bags in
and crash on the floor.</i>

792
00:48:45,625 --> 00:48:48,916
<i>Our family like that, all together,
when it was storming out,</i>

793
00:48:49,500 --> 00:48:50,660
<i>it's one of my best memories.</i>

794
00:48:51,291 --> 00:48:53,333
<i>Not long after that, my mom got sick,</i>

795
00:48:53,416 --> 00:48:56,458
<i>and my dad retired from the Corps
to take care of her.</i>

796
00:48:56,541 --> 00:48:58,875
<i>He went to every single one
of her chemo appointments.</i>

797
00:48:59,791 --> 00:49:03,166
<i>Sat up all night by her bed
when she went to the hospital at the end.</i>

798
00:49:03,791 --> 00:49:06,000
<i>Hmm. That's what love means to me.</i>

799
00:49:08,083 --> 00:49:09,750
<i>I guess that's what I want for us.</i>

800
00:49:09,833 --> 00:49:11,500
<i>My dear husband.</i>

801
00:49:11,583 --> 00:49:13,250
<i>Car ride over plane ride.</i>

802
00:49:13,333 --> 00:49:16,750
<i>Breakfast tacos over late-night tacos,
with lots of hot sauce.</i>

803
00:49:16,833 --> 00:49:18,291
<i>Lots of it.</i>

804
00:49:18,375 --> 00:49:21,833
<i>I've never left California,
but my dream is to circle the globe</i>

805
00:49:21,916 --> 00:49:23,500
<i>with my band someday.</i>

806
00:49:23,583 --> 00:49:26,083
<i>If I were home more,
I'd have a pet iguana.</i>

807
00:49:26,166 --> 00:49:28,416
<i>Shut up. They're highly intelligent.</i>

808
00:49:28,916 --> 00:49:31,000
<i>My darling wife.</i>

809
00:49:31,083 --> 00:49:35,208
<i>Nothing ruins a taco more than hot sauce.
It totally kills the flavor.</i>

810
00:49:35,291 --> 00:49:38,291
<i>Someday I'm going to run a marathon
in every major city.</i>

811
00:49:38,375 --> 00:49:40,333
<i>That's how I'm going to see the world.</i>

812
00:49:40,416 --> 00:49:45,041
<i>And I don't mean to burst your bubble,
but an iguana isn't in the cards for us.</i>

813
00:49:47,500 --> 00:49:51,416
<i>The only pet I've ever had
was a goldfish I won at the state fair.</i>

814
00:50:01,416 --> 00:50:02,750
Hey, can you, uh...

815
00:50:02,833 --> 00:50:05,458
<i>- Can you see me?
- Yeah. Uh, can you see me?</i>

816
00:50:06,125 --> 00:50:08,166
Uh, yeah. Yeah.

817
00:50:08,666 --> 00:50:09,666
Hi.

818
00:50:10,333 --> 00:50:11,333
<i>Hi.</i>

819
00:50:12,541 --> 00:50:14,666
<i>Oh, your, uh, your best friend is here.</i>

820
00:50:15,375 --> 00:50:17,333
<i>- You remember my wife?
- Yeah.</i>

821
00:50:17,416 --> 00:50:19,583
I remember. The love birds.

822
00:50:19,666 --> 00:50:21,266
<i>Luke, is that Cassie?</i>

823
00:50:21,333 --> 00:50:22,458
Hi!

824
00:50:22,541 --> 00:50:24,458
- Riley says, "What's up?"
<i>- Hi, Riley.</i>

825
00:50:24,541 --> 00:50:26,125
<i>- Hey, Cassie.</i>
- How is it?

826
00:50:26,208 --> 00:50:28,583
Uh, you know,
I got sand in my butt crack, so.

827
00:50:31,166 --> 00:50:32,166
Sounds fantastic.

828
00:50:33,416 --> 00:50:36,625
So, how was your day, babe?

829
00:50:37,500 --> 00:50:39,000
Uh, it was fine.

830
00:50:39,916 --> 00:50:40,916
<i>Babe.</i>

831
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:42,250
I, um...

832
00:50:42,916 --> 00:50:44,208
I worked,

833
00:50:44,291 --> 00:50:47,250
<i>and I started to write a song.</i>

834
00:50:47,333 --> 00:50:49,708
Wait, you just wrote a song?
Like, just like that?

835
00:50:49,791 --> 00:50:51,916
- Hey, Cassie, play it for us!
- Play it for us!

836
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:53,458
Play it! Play it!

837
00:50:53,541 --> 00:50:54,666
<i>Play it!</i>

838
00:50:54,750 --> 00:50:56,166
- Play it! Play it!
- Come on!

839
00:50:56,250 --> 00:50:58,125
I mean, it's not... it's not finished.

840
00:50:58,208 --> 00:50:59,208
Play it for us!

841
00:50:59,291 --> 00:51:00,434
- Please.
- Come on!

842
00:51:00,458 --> 00:51:03,541
Look, I'm hoping the song will be finished
in, like, a week.

843
00:51:04,833 --> 00:51:05,875
Come on.

844
00:51:05,958 --> 00:51:07,333
<i>Okay, okay.</i>

845
00:51:07,416 --> 00:51:10,250
<i>I promise. Guys,
I promise I'll sing it for you guys then.</i>

846
00:51:10,833 --> 00:51:14,666
All right, well, one week.
You know where to find us.

847
00:51:14,750 --> 00:51:17,416
Hey, we should go, fellas. Chow time!

848
00:51:17,500 --> 00:51:19,250
By all means, chow.

849
00:51:19,333 --> 00:51:20,541
Love you, Cass!

850
00:51:20,625 --> 00:51:21,625
I, uh...

851

01:00:24,166 --> 01:00:26,875
<i>He's going to be transferred from Germany</i>

1025
01:00:26,958 --> 01:00:29,416
<i>to the Naval Medical Center in San Diego.</i>

1026
01:00:30,625 --> 01:00:31,666
Is he okay?

1027
01:00:32,250 --> 01:00:35,291
<i>His legs were injured
during an IED detonation.</i>

1028
01:00:35,375 --> 01:00:36,750
<i>He's currently undergoing surgery.</i>

1029
01:00:36,833 --> 01:00:38,291
No, this isn't happening.

1030
01:00:38,375 --> 01:00:40,415
<i>Sorry, but I'm having
a hard time understanding you.</i>

1031
01:00:45,208 --> 01:00:46,208
Shit!

1032
01:01:02,291 --> 01:01:03,375
Jacob Morrow.

1033
01:01:05,208 --> 01:01:06,875
Jacob Morrow.

1034
01:01:08,125 --> 01:01:09,833
Luke's brother, I'll find you.

1035
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:53,000
Can I help you?

1036
01:01:54,666 --> 01:01:56,866
- I'm looking for Jacob Morrow.
- You found him.

1037
01:02:00,375 --> 01:02:03,333
Is Luke's brother here by any chance?
It's important.

1038
01:02:03,416 --> 01:02:05,750
I'm Luke's father. What's he done?
What's he done now?

1039
01:02:07,250 --> 01:02:09,625
- I really need to talk to his brother.
- Stop.

1040
01:02:10,875 --> 01:02:12,708
Cut the shit. What do you want?

1041
01:02:12,791 --> 01:02:15,833
Is Luke in jail? He owe you money? What?

1042
01:02:16,958 --> 01:02:18,708
Luke was wounded in combat.

1043
01:02:20,166 --> 01:02:22,375
Sir. He's in Iraq.

1044
01:02:22,458 --> 01:02:24,416
- Or he was in Iraq.
- Wh...

1045
01:02:24,500 --> 01:02:27,333
- He deployed a couple of months ago.
- Hang on.

1046
01:02:27,416 --> 01:02:29,583
I didn't even know he had enlisted.

1047
01:02:31,916 --> 01:02:33,916
- How bad is he?
- I haven't seen him.

1048
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:37,083
The Marines called me last night,
and they said that...

1049
01:02:38,250 --> 01:02:41,666
...that his legs had been shattered,
uh, by some kind of IED.

1050
01:02:41,750 --> 01:02:42,958
Ah, Jesus.

1051
01:02:43,041 --> 01:02:44,401
And that he would be here

1052
01:02:45,166 --> 01:02:47,166
in a couple of days.

1053
01:02:48,291 --> 01:02:51,333
- I'm so sorry.
- Why'd they call you?

1054
01:02:57,375 --> 01:02:58,750
I'm his wife.

1055
01:03:04,041 --> 01:03:05,208
Surprise.

1056
01:03:07,041 --> 01:03:08,541
I'm sorry, come on in.

1057
01:03:22,208 --> 01:03:23,875
Lance Corporal Morrow?

1058
01:03:23,958 --> 01:03:26,125
Back to U.S. soil.
You look a little dizzy.

1059
01:03:26,208 --> 01:03:28,083
Lance Corporal Morrow?

1060
01:03:28,166 --> 01:03:30,416
So, your skin grafts
were successful,

1061
01:03:30,500 --> 01:03:33,220
but I'm gonna keep you on this wound vac
for a week to help you heal.

1062
01:03:33,291 --> 01:03:34,791
Right now, your family's here.

1063
01:03:34,875 --> 01:03:37,541
You lean on them,
you'll be on the mend before you know it.

1064
01:03:40,416 --> 01:03:41,541
Right over here.

1065
01:03:46,666 --> 01:03:47,666
Luke.

1066
01:03:52,791 --> 01:03:53,875
Dad?

1067
01:03:53,958 --> 01:03:56,375
Oh my God. Jeez, man,
we could have lost you.

1068
01:03:56,916 --> 01:03:59,541
You could've told us
you got married.

1069
01:03:59,625 --> 01:04:01,458
Yeah, congratulations.

1070
01:04:01,541 --> 01:04:03,000
- Thanks.
- Thanks.

1071
01:04:05,916 --> 01:04:06,916
Hi.

1072
01:04:07,666 --> 01:04:08,916
- Hi, babe.
- Hi.

1073
01:04:15,583 --> 01:04:17,833
I'm... I'm so sorry, honey.

1074
01:04:17,916 --> 01:04:20,416
I never thought I'd see you
in the Corps.

1075
01:04:20,500 --> 01:04:22,791
I hear you're getting a Purple Heart.

1076
01:04:22,875 --> 01:04:25,041
- Yeah.
- That's an honor.

1077
01:04:25,750 --> 01:04:28,000
You told Jake not to tell me you enlisted.

1078
01:04:29,166 --> 01:04:32,500
Why? Why did you have to lie to me again?

1079
01:04:35,250 --> 01:04:37,375
You'd have said I didn't think it through.

1080
01:04:40,041 --> 01:04:42,208
I hope to get the chance
to prove you wrong.

1081
01:04:42,708 --> 01:04:44,083
Yeah, me too.

1082
01:04:47,791 --> 01:04:50,958
So, how we doing?
Give me the rundown, Doctor.

1083
01:04:52,083 --> 01:04:55,500
Look, this is going to be a long rehab,
and he's starting from zero.

1084
01:04:55,583 --> 01:04:58,916
- Doctor, will he be able to run again?
- It's combat medicine, you know.

1085
01:04:59,000 --> 01:05:01,500
Let's get you walking first.
Then we can talk about running.

1086
01:05:01,583 --> 01:05:02,708
Thank you.

1087
01:05:03,750 --> 01:05:05,166
Well, your mom would, uh...

1088
01:05:06,958 --> 01:05:09,625
Your mother would've been heartbroken
to see you like this.

1089
01:05:16,250 --> 01:05:18,416
Hey. Let's give them a minute.

1090
01:05:18,500 --> 01:05:19,791
Yes, sir.

1091
01:05:19,875 --> 01:05:20,875
Thanks.

1092
01:05:28,583 --> 01:05:31,083
I, uh...

1093
01:05:32,916 --> 01:05:34,708
I went to the wrong Jacob Morrow.

1094
01:05:34,791 --> 01:05:37,666
I'm so sorry.
I... I was just scared for you...

1095
01:05:37,750 --> 01:05:39,291
You've got to be kidding me, Cassie.

1096
01:05:39,375 --> 01:05:42,166
What were you thinking?
We are totally screwed.

1097
01:05:42,250 --> 01:05:43,833
I told you he was Military Police.

1098
01:05:43,916 --> 01:05:45,756
You failed to mention
your dad and your brother

1099
01:05:45,791 --> 01:05:47,416
have the same frickin' name, Luke.

1100
01:05:47,500 --> 01:05:50,708
- It's fine. It's fine.
- It's not fine.

1101
01:05:50,791 --> 01:05:54,000
We'll just get a divorce,
and you'll never have to see me again.

1102
01:05:54,083 --> 01:05:57,625
No, no, no, he doesn't trust me already.
He's already watching us.

1103
01:05:57,708 --> 01:06:00,958
- No, he won't turn in his own son.
- You have no idea.

1104
01:06:01,708 --> 01:06:04,250
Even though he's retired,
he still acts like a cop.

1105
01:06:04,333 --> 01:06:07,013
Gotta keep it together. A couple months
until I get back on my feet.

1106
01:06:07,041 --> 01:06:10,041
We'll live together
just till I'm done with supervised PT.

1107
01:06:10,125 --> 01:06:11,916
W-We'll be off the radar. All right?

1108
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:15,458
Until then, we have to make them believe
this is a real marriage.

1109
01:06:15,541 --> 01:06:17,416
Luke, a couple of months?

1110
01:06:17,875 --> 01:06:19,041
Wha... I don't...

1111
01:06:19,125 --> 01:06:21,833
- What... What does that mean exactly?
- We act like married people.

1112
01:06:21,916 --> 01:06:22,916
Pretend.

1113
01:06:22,958 --> 01:06:25,416
All right?
You can do that. You can do that.

1114
01:06:25,500 --> 01:06:26,750
Pretend, all right?

1115
01:06:34,708 --> 01:06:38,083
- It's gonna be fine.
- It is. We're gonna play house.

1116
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:45,416
Is Frankie gonna laugh or cry
when he finds out about this?

1117
01:06:49,666 --> 01:06:50,666
Shit.

1118
01:06:52,875 --> 01:06:53,875
What?

1119
01:06:54,583 --> 01:06:56,375
- No one told you?
- What?

1120
01:06:59,208 --> 01:07:00,791
Frankie, he's, um...

1121
01:07:02,666 --> 01:07:04,500
The same mission as this. He, uh...

1122
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:07,375
He didn't make it, Cassie.

1123
01:07:07,458 --> 01:07:08,541
No.

1124
01:07:11,625 --> 01:07:13,916
I'm sorry, I...

1125
01:07:14,416 --> 01:07:15,791
I can't be here.

1126
01:07:23,666 --> 01:07:26,166
<i>Local Oceanside resident
Frankie Mubuthia</i>

1127
01:07:26,250 --> 01:07:28,375
<i>has been killed in the line of duty.</i>

1128
01:07:28,458 --> 01:07:30,583
<i>He was 20 years old.</i>

1129
01:07:31,250 --> 01:07:35,166
<i>His family says that they are proud
of his heroism and sacrifice</i>

1130
01:07:35,250 --> 01:07:36,791
<i>in the name of freedom.</i>

1131
01:07:36,875 --> 01:07:40,250
<i>His funeral will be held
at Fort Rosecrans in San Diego.</i>

1132
01:08:03,875 --> 01:08:06,208
Aim. Fire.

1133
01:08:06,291 --> 01:08:07,291
Aim.

1134
01:08:56,833 --> 01:08:58,500
Hi.

1135
01:08:59,000 --> 01:09:00,833
The service was beautiful.

1136
01:09:07,291 --> 01:09:09,708
Frankie bought this for you.

1137
01:09:14,083 --> 01:09:16,291
He was waiting to propose
until he came home,

1138
01:09:16,375 --> 01:09:18,583
and he asked me to keep it safe.

1139
01:09:20,958 --> 01:09:23,708
But I know that he really
would have wanted me to give this to you.

1140
01:09:28,041 --> 01:09:29,416
It fits you perfectly.

1141
01:09:32,583 --> 01:09:34,083
He loved you so much.

1142
01:10:01,625 --> 01:10:03,101
Hospital staff...

1143
01:10:07,958 --> 01:10:10,541
- What's he doing here?
- I have no idea.

1144
01:10:11,083 --> 01:10:12,833
Lance Corporal Morrow, congratulations.

1145
01:10:12,916 --> 01:10:15,416
Sounds like y'all are headed home.
Y'all live near the base?

1146
01:10:15,500 --> 01:10:16,416
Oh. Uh...

1147
01:10:16,500 --> 01:10:19,250
It all happened so fast
we didn't really get a chance...

1148
01:10:19,333 --> 01:10:21,500
- We didn't really live together. Yeah.
- Yeah.

1149
01:10:21,583 --> 01:10:23,833
Oh boy. Well, you will now.

1150
01:10:25,541 --> 01:10:26,541
Yeah.

1151
01:10:27,250 --> 01:10:28,625
Yeah.

1152
01:10:29,291 --> 01:10:30,166
Yeah.

1153
01:10:30,250 --> 01:10:33,333
I'll be taking care of you.

1154
01:10:33,416 --> 01:10:35,250
Cassie, listen. I'll swing by the house,

1155
01:10:36,500 --> 01:10:38,791
pick Luke up,
and take him to PT two times a week.

1156
01:10:38,875 --> 01:10:40,767
- Oh... Yeah.
- Oh. No, you don't have to do that.

1157
01:10:40,791 --> 01:10:43,017
Come on. It'll be great
to reconnect with my son.

1158
01:10:43,041 --> 01:10:45,250
Hear all about your whirlwind romance.

1159
01:10:47,666 --> 01:10:50,708
- Wow.
- You really, really don't have to do that.

1160
01:10:50,791 --> 01:10:52,291
I heard you the first time.

1161
01:10:53,333 --> 01:10:55,708
- Thank you.
- Mm-hmm.

1162
01:10:58,833 --> 01:11:00,000
I'll see you soon.

1163
01:11:06,500 --> 01:11:08,458
Good lord.

1164
01:11:12,750 --> 01:11:14,791
Nice and easy. Easy, buddy.

1165
01:11:14,875 --> 01:11:16,541
- Hold up for a second.
- Is it okay?

1166
01:11:17,708 --> 01:11:18,958
Home sweet home, bro.

1167
01:11:19,041 --> 01:11:21,916
- You're living in a three-story walk-up.
- Is there an elevator?

1168
01:11:22,000 --> 01:11:24,916
- Ah, nope.
- Lance Corporal Morrow. Here we go.

1169
01:11:25,000 --> 01:11:26,875
I'm gonna get one step ahead of you.

1170
01:11:28,083 --> 01:11:30,351
You're gonna need our help
with the stairs for sure.

1171
01:11:30,375 --> 01:11:33,875
Yep. We'll invite you in
next time. Thank you all so much. Bye.

1172
01:11:45,750 --> 01:11:47,166
Oh.

1173
01:11:47,250 --> 01:11:48,875
You're a runner too, huh?

1174
01:11:48,958 --> 01:11:50,500
It's a glucose gel.

1175
01:11:51,250 --> 01:11:54,583
I have diabetes, remember?
The reason we're married.

1176
01:11:54,666 --> 01:11:58,125
Oh, speaking off,
our wedding night was memorable,

1177
01:11:58,208 --> 01:12:00,125
but we gotta set some boundaries here.

1178
01:12:00,708 --> 01:12:01,708
Got it.

1179
01:12:04,833 --> 01:12:05,875
I'll take the couch.

1180
01:12:14,791 --> 01:12:17,625
I think there's
some leftover Thai food in the fridge.

1181
01:12:17,708 --> 01:12:19,348
I can't guarantee that it won't kill you.

1182
01:12:19,375 --> 01:12:21,791
Oh, and I should warn you
I'm not gonna be cooking for you...

1183
01:12:21,875 --> 01:12:23,916
- You're freaking out.
- Oh, what? And you're not?

1184
01:12:24,000 --> 01:12:25,916
I mean, I've never even lived
with a guy before.

1185
01:12:26,000 --> 01:12:27,666
Oh, no, no, no. I'm... I'm feeling super.

1186
01:12:27,750 --> 01:12:29,583
Stuck in a wheelchair three stories up.

1187
01:12:29,666 --> 01:12:32,666
Well, is this what's happening? Right now?
Like, we're just living together?

1188
01:12:32,750 --> 01:12:35,083
With your dad coming
in and out of my apartment

1189
01:12:35,166 --> 01:12:37,333
judging if I pass the wife test?

1190
01:12:37,416 --> 01:12:40,083
Because this isn't
what we agreed to.

1191
01:12:40,166 --> 01:12:42,958
Well, I'm sorry that my injury
is inconveniencing you.

1192
01:12:43,041 --> 01:12:46,375
- It must be so, so hard for you.
- Don't put this on me, Luke.

1193
01:12:46,458 --> 01:12:48,333
You can't be happy about this.

1194
01:12:48,416 --> 01:12:51,500
Like, am I really the person
you want taking care of you right now?

1195
01:12:51,583 --> 01:12:54,083
No, no, no, you are not
taking care of me. Please, don't.

1196
01:12:54,166 --> 01:12:57,166
- Well, you're living with me!
- To avoid a court-martial!

1197
01:12:57,250 --> 01:13:00,458
What don't you understand about that?
You could be charged too.

1198
01:13:02,583 --> 01:13:04,041
Jesus!

1199
01:13:07,250 --> 01:13:08,541
Let's just get through this.

1200
01:13:09,416 --> 01:13:10,416
Super.

1201
01:13:10,958 --> 01:13:12,083
Super.

1202
01:13:21,416 --> 01:13:23,625
Jake just said that
Dad's gonna be here in 20.

1203
01:13:23,708 --> 01:13:24,708

Here, quick.
I made you a replacement ring.

1224
01:14:15,625 --> 01:14:17,225
- Do I need one, really?
- Really.

1225
01:14:18,416 --> 01:14:19,916
Where did you get this?

1226
01:14:20,000 --> 01:14:21,125
I made it out of this.

1227
01:14:22,500 --> 01:14:23,875
That'll do.

1228
01:14:26,250 --> 01:14:28,250
Okay, husband.

1229
01:14:28,333 --> 01:14:29,750
God, that word.

1230
01:14:33,750 --> 01:14:35,208
- Hi.
- How's it going?

1231
01:14:35,291 --> 01:14:36,541
- Good.
- Hey.

1232
01:14:36,625 --> 01:14:38,505
- Hey, bro.
- Okay, let's see the place.

1233
01:14:38,541 --> 01:14:39,541
How you doing?

1234
01:14:41,375 --> 01:14:42,791
- Hi, Dad.
- Wow.

1235
01:14:42,875 --> 01:14:44,875
This place got the Luke Morrow makeover.

1236
01:14:44,958 --> 01:14:47,500
If the man doesn't see
enough right angles, he unravels.

1237
01:14:47,583 --> 01:14:50,666
I'm allowed one drawer. Just one.

1238
01:14:50,750 --> 01:14:53,833

- All right. Hang on.

1244
01:15:04,250 --> 01:15:07,666

- Hey, he's a marine. He'll bounce.

I'd like you all to meet the newest artist

1254
01:15:43,416 --> 01:15:46,041
we're considering for our label,
Cassie Salazar.

1255
01:15:46,791 --> 01:15:49,208
- Let's go, Cass.
- Okay, okay, okay.

1256
01:15:49,291 --> 01:15:50,208
It's not ready yet,

1257
01:15:50,291 --> 01:15:52,666

1276
01:16:54,208 --> 01:16:57,083

you and your fake wife got.</i>

1277
01:16:57,833 --> 01:16:59,541

1280
01:17:12,458 --> 01:17:13,750
Yeah, Cass!

1281
01:17:23,041 --> 01:17:24,458
- Hi.
- Hi.

1282
01:17:25,458 --> 01:17:26,875
You're back early.

1283
01:17:26,958 --> 01:17:27,958
Yeah.

1284
01:17:28,000 --> 01:17:30,583
- Okay, well, I'm, uh... I'm almost done.
- No rush.

1285
01:17:34,416 --> 01:17:36,541
Look at you.
Doing so much better.

1286
01:17:36,625 --> 01:17:38,791
Yeah.

1287
01:17:39,625 --> 01:17:40,666
Slowly, slowly.

1288
01:17:42,750 --> 01:17:45,166
Hold up, girl.

1289
01:17:45,250 --> 01:17:46,583
Hey, Jake, you get a dog?

1290
01:17:47,291 --> 01:17:48,416
You crazy?

1291
01:17:49,125 --> 01:17:50,125
She's for you.

1292
01:17:50,916 --> 01:17:53,458
Her name is Peaches
because she's from Georgia.

1293
01:17:56,250 --> 01:17:57,625
Peaches, hi!

1294
01:17:58,208 --> 01:17:59,750
Sit.

1295
01:17:59,833 --> 01:18:02,041
Paw! Good girl!

1296
01:18:02,125 --> 01:18:04,458
See? We got training
and everything already done for you.

1297
01:18:05,041 --> 01:18:07,458
We read that dogs can be really helpful

1298
01:18:07,541 --> 01:18:09,916
for guys like you,
healing from injuries like yours.

1299
01:18:10,000 --> 01:18:12,000
- Oh, really?
- I read it.

1300
01:18:12,833 --> 01:18:16,708
- Then she texted me.
- I don't need you plotting behind my back.

1301
01:18:18,500 --> 01:18:21,208
Well, too bad, because it's good for you.

1302
01:18:27,416 --> 01:18:29,416
Guys like me?

1303
01:18:30,958 --> 01:18:33,166
Guys like me. What? Like a cripple?

1304
01:18:33,250 --> 01:18:35,166
I don't need your pity.

1305
01:18:35,250 --> 01:18:36,791
All right, have it your way!

1306
01:18:36,875 --> 01:18:39,000
Listen, I know what's good for me.

1307
01:18:39,083 --> 01:18:41,041
I can make decisions for myself.

1308
01:18:42,958 --> 01:18:44,833
People don't say
"cripple" anymore.

1309
01:18:44,916 --> 01:18:45,916
This is bullshit.

1310
01:18:46,000 --> 01:18:47,958
You know, it's okay
to accept help sometimes.

1311
01:18:48,041 --> 01:18:49,291
What the hell, Luke?

1312
01:18:50,708 --> 01:18:53,666
See? Peaches gets it.

1313
01:18:53,750 --> 01:18:56,791
Fine, I'll take her.

1314
01:18:56,875 --> 01:18:59,636
- Good girl, Peaches. Good girl.
- Good girl!

1315
01:19:14,916 --> 01:19:17,833
Luke? Hey, Peaches, where's Luke?

1316
01:19:19,208 --> 01:19:20,375
Hello?

1317
01:19:20,958 --> 01:19:21,958
Luke?

1318
01:19:25,833 --> 01:19:27,041
Oh my God.

1319
01:19:27,583 --> 01:19:29,125
- You're walking.
- Barely.

1320
01:19:30,333 --> 01:19:32,833
Hurts like a bitch.

1321
01:19:33,416 --> 01:19:36,208
- You know, apparently, I'm a psychic.
- Oh yeah?

1322
01:19:36,291 --> 01:19:39,208
Because though I would usually
just get myself breakfast tacos.

1323
01:19:39,291 --> 01:19:42,833
This morning I woke up, and I thought,
"I wonder if Luke deserves one?"

1324
01:19:42,916 --> 01:19:44,625
- Oh. One?
- Oh, calm down.

1325
01:19:44,708 --> 01:19:46,333
I got way too many.

1326
01:19:46,416 --> 01:19:48,916
I even got our dog a taco.

1327
01:19:49,000 --> 01:19:50,541
Right, Peaches. Yeah.

1328
01:19:55,791 --> 01:19:57,291
Did you fix the doorknob?

1329
01:19:57,916 --> 01:19:58,916
Mm-hmm.

1330
01:20:02,208 --> 01:20:03,791
Thanks, I guess.

1331
01:20:03,875 --> 01:20:07,166
You know you can let a guy help you
and still be a feminist, right?

1332
01:20:07,250 --> 01:20:11,708
I'd rather have a broken knob
than have you lecture me on feminism.

1333
01:20:11,791 --> 01:20:14,471
Oh, okay, so you wanna live
on an island of broken doorknobs?

1334
01:20:14,500 --> 01:20:16,375
Why don't you say, "Luke, you're wrong."

1335
01:20:16,458 --> 01:20:18,583
- "You don't understand me."
- Luke, you're wrong.

1336
01:20:18,666 --> 01:20:20,386
- You don't understand me.
- I'm not.

1337
01:20:20,458 --> 01:20:23,041
Really? Well, I'm doing okay on my own.

1338
01:20:23,125 --> 01:20:27,041
Maybe I don't need the chaos
of someone having my heart or whatever.

1339
01:20:27,125 --> 01:20:28,250
Hmm.

1340
01:20:31,250 --> 01:20:33,250
Oh no. No more tacos if you do that.

1341
01:20:35,500 --> 01:20:37,583
- Do what?
- "Hmm."

1342
01:20:37,666 --> 01:20:38,916
Just say the damn thing.

1343
01:20:41,416 --> 01:20:44,958
Okay. The same reason you and I
wouldn't work. You don't believe in love.

1344
01:20:46,875 --> 01:20:51,083
Wow, I had no idea that Psych 101
was part of basic training.

1345
01:20:51,166 --> 01:20:55,416
Well, you realize I'm a marine, right?
So, the training is not exactly basic.

1346
01:20:55,500 --> 01:20:56,833
Oh yeah, I've seen the movies.

1347
01:20:56,916 --> 01:20:59,916
I've done my homework.
I'm a proud military wife, after all.

1348
01:21:00,000 --> 01:21:03,291
You don't wanna date
a guy that you actually like

1349
01:21:03,375 --> 01:21:05,892
because that would mean, you know,
you'd have to give up control

1350
01:21:05,916 --> 01:21:06,750
and let someone in.

1351
01:21:06,833 --> 01:21:08,958
Okay, yeah.
Well, maybe having control issues

1352
01:21:09,041 --> 01:21:10,583
just means that I'm being smart.

1353
01:21:10,666 --> 01:21:13,208
So maybe you don't know
what you're talking about.

1354
01:21:13,291 --> 01:21:15,500
Mmm, that's fake news.

1355
01:21:15,583 --> 01:21:19,208
Because when it comes
to control issues, I'm self-taught.

1356
01:21:19,291 --> 01:21:20,625
You?

1357
01:21:20,708 --> 01:21:22,041
You seem so chill.

1358
01:21:22,125 --> 01:21:25,041
Listen, it's this,
or I'm breaking six laws,

1359
01:21:25,125 --> 01:21:28,666
going 120 down the 405
with no pants on. So...

1360
01:21:31,625 --> 01:21:33,000
Metaphorically?

1361
01:21:36,375 --> 01:21:37,958
Hard to picture.

1362
01:21:39,750 --> 01:21:42,333
Not that I'm picturing it.

1363
01:21:42,416 --> 01:21:43,416
Okay.

1364
01:21:45,666 --> 01:21:48,125
What kind of freak
skips out on the Tapatío?

1365
01:21:48,208 --> 01:21:49,958
Wow.

1366
01:21:50,041 --> 01:21:54,625
You know, you snowflakes
are just... You're so judgy.

1367
01:21:55,666 --> 01:21:57,458
Don't start this.

1368
01:21:58,083 --> 01:22:01,041
Okay, control freak, you ready to let go?

1369
01:22:01,125 --> 01:22:02,767
- Hell yeah.
- Drive on the wild side?

1370
01:22:02,791 --> 01:22:04,184
- Bring it on.
- Pants down?

1371
01:22:04,208 --> 01:22:06,541
- Are you ready for this?
- Yeah.

1372
01:22:08,333 --> 01:22:10,166
Bring it on.

1373
01:22:12,833 --> 01:22:14,166
- Ready?
- Yeah.

1374
01:22:14,250 --> 01:22:15,250
On three.

1375
01:22:15,291 --> 01:22:18,041
One. Two. Three.

1376
01:22:23,541 --> 01:22:25,958
Do you wanna spit it out?

1377
01:22:26,041 --> 01:22:27,958
It's not spicy.

1378
01:22:35,916 --> 01:22:36,916
Oh my G...

1379
01:22:38,375 --> 01:22:39,375
Can't breathe.

1380
01:22:39,458 --> 01:22:40,958
No, I'm totally fine.

1381
01:22:41,541 --> 01:22:42,809
- I go...
- Spit it out!

1382
01:22:43,875 --> 01:22:45,458
- No!
- You're gonna lose.

1383
01:22:47,583 --> 01:22:49,291
Okay, I can't.

1384
01:22:49,375 --> 01:22:50,375
Agh!

1385
01:22:50,458 --> 01:22:52,258
- Victory is mine!
- Oh my God.

1386
01:22:52,291 --> 01:22:54,625
I'm bleeding from my eyes.
I'm bleeding from...

1387
01:22:55,833 --> 01:22:57,041
Yes!

1388
01:22:57,125 --> 01:22:59,500
Oh wow.

1389
01:22:59,583 --> 01:23:00,916
I won.

1390
01:23:01,000 --> 01:23:02,760
- You lost.
- I got something for you.

1391
01:23:02,833 --> 01:23:06,041
It's in my back pocket.
Gimme one second. Here it is, right there.

1392
01:23:06,125 --> 01:23:07,416
Ah!

1393
01:23:07,500 --> 01:23:11,125
I'm in pain. I'm in so much pain.

1394
01:23:11,208 --> 01:23:13,708
You are sweating. Here.

1395
01:23:13,791 --> 01:23:15,083
Oh.

1396
01:23:15,166 --> 01:23:16,791
- Thank you.
- Mm-hmm.

1397
01:23:18,083 --> 01:23:20,833
Why would anyone do that to themselves?
I don't understand.

1398
01:23:21,375 --> 01:23:23,750
- You're sweating too.
- No.

1399
01:23:24,375 --> 01:23:26,333
This isn't sweat. This is a glow.

1400
01:23:32,416 --> 01:23:34,916
Maybe we should watch
a movie or something.

1401
01:23:35,000 --> 01:23:39,000
I can smell the jalapeños
coming out of your pores. So, uh...

1402
01:23:39,083 --> 01:23:41,333
Maybe you take a shower first.

1403
01:23:43,083 --> 01:23:44,083
Well...

1404
01:23:44,750 --> 01:23:47,708
Getting in the shower means
standing up for a long period of time,

1405
01:23:47,791 --> 01:23:50,333
which means radiating pain.

1406
01:23:50,416 --> 01:23:52,791
Okay, then take a bath?

1407
01:23:52,875 --> 01:23:56,416
- It's gonna just make you feel better.
- Getting in the tub is also a nightmare.

1408
01:24:19,666 --> 01:24:20,666
Here.

1409
01:24:43,958 --> 01:24:44,958
It's not pretty.

1410
01:24:53,000 --> 01:24:56,083
- I can do that myself.
- Just let me.

1411
01:25:05,083 --> 01:25:07,333
I see how hard
you've been working at it,

1412
01:25:07,416 --> 01:25:10,041
and you'll run again, Luke.

1413
01:25:11,416 --> 01:25:12,916
I believe in you.

1414
01:25:27,666 --> 01:25:29,791
Why don't you sleep in the bed tonight?

1415
01:25:54,958 --> 01:25:56,041
Hi, Peaches.

1416
01:25:58,166 --> 01:26:00,750
- Hi, good girl.
- Hey, baby. Okay.

1417
01:26:00,833 --> 01:26:03,583
Yeah, you wanna go that way,
all right.

1418
01:26:04,875 --> 01:26:07,041
God, I haven't been back here
in so long.

1419
01:26:07,125 --> 01:26:09,291
Remember, my dad doesn't trust me.

1420
01:26:09,375 --> 01:26:11,615
- He's gonna be watching everything.
- Dude, don't worry.

1421
01:26:11,666 --> 01:26:15,416
I mean, look at us. We're so cute
and suburban, it's disgusting.

1422
01:26:15,500 --> 01:26:16,791
Come on, Peaches!

1423
01:26:18,333 --> 01:26:21,583
Okay, guys, I want you to listen
to a song. All right, ready for this?

1424
01:26:27,000 --> 01:26:29,041
She's my new favorite artist.

1425
01:26:29,125 --> 01:26:31,125
- I hate you.
- What?

1426
01:26:31,208 --> 01:26:33,958
- I like this song.
- Uncle Luke, play football with me.

1427
01:26:34,041 --> 01:26:35,708
- You bossing me around?
- Yeah.

1428
01:26:35,791 --> 01:26:37,559
- Okay.
- Come on, Uncle Luke.

1429
01:26:37,583 --> 01:26:40,291
No, he's got an injury, little man.
Let your uncle take it easy.

1430
01:26:40,375 --> 01:26:42,434
- Take it easy?
- Uncle Luke's hurt.

1431
01:26:42,458 --> 01:26:44,250
Take it easy?
Oh, heck, no. All right.

1432
01:26:44,333 --> 01:26:46,309
- You sure?
- You're my walking stick.

1433
01:26:46,333 --> 01:26:47,833
- Be careful.
- She's right.

1434
01:26:47,916 --> 01:26:49,875
- Yeah.
- Hey, let me see that ball.

1435
01:26:50,375 --> 01:26:51,750
- Oh! Nice throw!
- Oh!

1436
01:26:51,833 --> 01:26:54,875
I guess we're doing this. Yeah.

1437
01:26:54,958 --> 01:26:56,708
Are y'all thinking about having kids?

1438
01:26:58,166 --> 01:26:59,041
Uh...

1439
01:26:59,125 --> 01:27:03,583
Hey, Hailey, let her be
a rock star first, okay?

1440
01:27:04,125 --> 01:27:05,000

I'm Cassie's friend. You all right?

Uh, uh, I don't know. Someone broke
the door and broke the window, I think.

1470
01:28:16,958 --> 01:28:18,500
There's glass everywhere and... Oh!

1471
01:28:18,583 --> 01:28:20,791
- I... I thought you had a show.
- Thank you for coming.

1472
01:28:22,583 --> 01:28:24,583
It's been 30 minutes
since I called the police.

1473
01:28:24,666 --> 01:28:26,726
- They don't rush for this neighborhood.
- Oh, come on.

1474
01:28:26,750 --> 01:28:28,250
- Welcome to the ugly truth.
- Ma'am.

1475
01:28:28,333 --> 01:28:30,041
Give me your keys. I'm gonna check it out.

Hi. Why did you wait up?

1484
01:29:55,916 --> 01:29:57,250
I couldn't get to sleep.

1485
01:30:03,666 --> 01:30:04,833
What did the cops say?

1486
01:30:06,083 --> 01:30:07,250
Um...

We'll get back to you... blah, blah, blah.

01:30:10,416 --> 01:30:11,500
Oh.

1489
01:30:12,083 --> 01:30:14,708
I can't believe
I have this show tomorrow.

1490
01:30:14,791 --> 01:30:18,125
- Tonight.
- You don't look great, Cass. You okay?

Whoa, whoa. Hey.

01:30:30,166 --> 01:30:32,750
Yeah.

1496
01:30:32,833 --> 01:30:36,041
We're going to the couch.
Put your weight on me. Yup.

1497
01:30:36,125 --> 01:30:37,958
Okay.

Easy, Peaches.

1505
01:30:57,375 --> 01:30:58,958
Okay. Okay.

1506
01:30:59,041 --> 01:31:01,281
I want you to grab a hold of me.
Grab a hold of me. Yeah.

1507
01:31:01,333 --> 01:31:04,875
Yup, yup, yup, yup.
Okay, come up. All right.

1508
01:31:04,958 --> 01:31:07,750
Okay. Okay. Open, open.

1509
01:31:08,541 --> 01:31:10,875
There you go. All right.

1510
01:31:11,541 --> 01:31:13,583
- Okay? Enough? All right.
- Mmm. Mmm.

1511
01:31:14,875 --> 01:31:16,833
Okay.

1512
01:31:19,375 --> 01:31:20,875
How long does it take to work?

1513
01:31:21,750 --> 01:31:25,000
- Like, 20 minutes.
- Twenty minutes. Okay.

1514
01:31:25,083 --> 01:31:26,458
All right.

1515
01:31:26,541 --> 01:31:27,958
Relax, it's gonna be fine.

1516
01:31:28,041 --> 01:31:29,666
Yeah.

1517
01:31:40,541 --> 01:31:42,458

1518
01:31:44,791 --> 01:31:46,708
That's because it's scary, dammit.

01:31:49,750 --> 01:31:50,750
See?

I'm letting you help me.

1521
01:32:37,375 --> 01:32:38,875
Ahh!

1522
01:32:38,958 --> 01:32:43,041
If you mess with that woman again,
and you so much as look at my wife,

1523
01:32:43,125 --> 01:32:43,958
I will kill you.

1524
01:32:44,041 --> 01:32:46,583

1525
01:32:46,666 --> 01:32:48,500
Uh-huh. Uh-huh.

1527
01:33:07,708 --> 01:33:08,708
We're done.

1528
01:33:55,416 --> 01:33:57,208
I miss you like hell, man.

1529
01:34:01,041 --> 01:34:02,375
I hope you know that.

1530
01:34:43,333 --> 01:34:44,583
Hey, Frankie...

1531
01:34:45,208 --> 01:34:47,333
...you wanna
hear something crazy?

1532
01:34:51,250 --> 01:34:53,625
I think Cassie Salazar's my best friend.

1533
01:34:56,958 --> 01:34:57,958
I do.

1534
01:35:05,333 --> 01:35:06,583
I love you.

1535
01:35:18,708 --> 01:35:19,708
Hi.

1536
01:35:25,875 --> 01:35:26,875
What's going on?

1537
01:35:28,333 --> 01:35:29,708
I just spoke to my mom.

1538
01:35:29,791 --> 01:35:31,500
Oh. How's she doing?

1539
01:35:34,458 --> 01:35:37,416
She called because she was freaking out.

1540
01:35:37,500 --> 01:35:39,458
She was trying
to get into her car just now,

1541
01:35:39,541 --> 01:35:42,166
and some guy with blood on his shirt

1542
01:35:42,250 --> 01:35:44,666
rolled up, wanting to talk about you.

1543
01:35:46,250 --> 01:35:47,166
Oh.

1544
01:35:47,250 --> 01:35:50,458
About you and me,
and how we're in a fake marriage.

1545
01:35:50,541 --> 01:35:52,261
Threatening to turn us in.

1546
01:35:52,333 --> 01:35:55,125
She'll understand why though, right?

1547
01:35:57,333 --> 01:35:59,291
Why aren't you asking me who it was?

1548
01:36:00,916 --> 01:36:02,958
Fuck you, Luke. Fuck you!

1549
01:36:03,041 --> 01:36:04,708
- I'm sorry.
- You owe him money?

1550
01:36:04,791 --> 01:36:08,125
This guy said. And that
he sent you a message last night?

1551
01:36:08,208 --> 01:36:10,125
I'm sorry. Okay? I'm so sorry.

1552
01:36:10,208 --> 01:36:12,291
They broke into my mother's house, Luke!

1553
01:36:12,375 --> 01:36:14,875
- I... I am so sorry.
- Did you know?

1554
01:36:16,000 --> 01:36:18,750
You must have, right? That's why
you said you'd pay for the damages.

1555
01:36:18,833 --> 01:36:20,375
- Can you let me explain?
- Yes!

1556
01:36:20,458 --> 01:36:22,041
I'm an addict.

1557
01:36:23,291 --> 01:36:24,375
I'm clean now.

1558
01:36:24,458 --> 01:36:28,375
- Two years sober, okay?
- And what? This guy was your dealer?

1559
01:36:30,708 --> 01:36:32,583
That's why your dad
stopped talking to you.

1560
01:36:32,666 --> 01:36:34,083
Because you were using.

1561
01:36:34,166 --> 01:36:35,708
When my mom died, I, uh...

1562
01:36:37,208 --> 01:36:39,250
I got into her medication just to cope.

1563
01:36:39,833 --> 01:36:42,916
But when I ran out,
Johnno was right there to help me.

1564
01:36:43,000 --> 01:36:46,250
- What does that have anything to do...
- Okay. Yeah.

1565
01:36:46,333 --> 01:36:49,041
I stole a $50,000 car from my dad.

1566
01:36:49,125 --> 01:36:50,583
A classic Corvette.

1567
01:36:50,666 --> 01:36:53,375
He was rebuilding it
for one of his biggest customers.

1568
01:36:53,458 --> 01:36:54,708
And I broke in.

1569
01:36:55,291 --> 01:36:57,416
I was out of my mind, and...

1570
01:36:59,541 --> 01:37:00,625
I was desperate.

1571
01:37:01,625 --> 01:37:03,708
I was gonna sell it, and instead, I just...

1572
01:37:05,583 --> 01:37:07,666
took it on the freeway, and I totaled it.

1573
01:37:08,250 --> 01:37:10,166
And he said
if I didn't pay that customer back,

1574
01:37:10,250 --> 01:37:11,666
he'd turn me in himself.

1575
01:37:12,250 --> 01:37:13,500
You weren't kidding about him.

1576
01:37:13,583 --> 01:37:16,791
Whatever I didn't have,
I borrowed from Johnno.

1577
01:37:17,666 --> 01:37:19,750
This is why you needed to marry me.

1578
01:37:20,625 --> 01:37:21,625
Yeah.

1579
01:37:23,083 --> 01:37:24,291
Yeah, but look.

1580
01:37:24,375 --> 01:37:25,500
I dealt with him.

1581
01:37:26,083 --> 01:37:28,708
Okay? I paid him. It's done.

1582
01:37:28,791 --> 01:37:32,166
They could have hurt her,
and she's the only thing that I have.

1583
01:37:32,250 --> 01:37:35,166
- I know, Cassie. I know, I know.
- No. No.

1584
01:37:36,208 --> 01:37:38,583
Don't... Don't just walk away.

1585
01:37:39,166 --> 01:37:40,166
Okay, I'm sorry.

1586
01:37:40,208 --> 01:37:43,416
Not every man you let into your life
is a bad guy that you can't trust.

1587
01:37:43,500 --> 01:37:45,250
Really, Luke? What are you?

1588
01:37:45,333 --> 01:37:47,250
I am someone
who shows up when you need me.

1589
01:37:47,333 --> 01:37:49,375
I don't need you.

1590
01:37:50,541 --> 01:37:51,666
I don't need you.

1591
01:37:52,916 --> 01:37:55,291
Just listen, okay?

1592
01:37:56,041 --> 01:37:57,541
I am so sorry.

1593
01:37:57,625 --> 01:38:00,458
- I messed up.
- Go stay at your dad's or your brother's.

1594
01:38:01,625 --> 01:38:03,305
And tell them that we're getting divorced.

1595
01:38:05,333 --> 01:38:07,041
I'm gonna go to my show tonight,

1596
01:38:07,125 --> 01:38:09,833
but when I come back tomorrow,
I want you gone.

01:41:39,125 --> 01:41:41,291
I've never seen you play like that
in your life!

1635
01:41:41,375 --> 01:41:45,041
I know a bunch of those people out there.
They're freaking out.

1636
01:41:45,125 --> 01:41:47,458
Marina, promoter from The Hollywood Bowl,
wants you to open

1637
01:41:47,541 --> 01:41:49,381
for Florence and the Machine
in a couple weeks.

1638
01:41:49,416 --> 01:41:50,250
What?

1639
01:41:50,333 --> 01:41:52,133
The Loyal
and Florence and the Machine.

1640
01:41:52,166 --> 01:41:53,750
- What?
- This is massive!

1641
01:41:55,333 --> 01:41:57,166
Hollywood Bowl!

1642
01:42:07,791 --> 01:42:11,291
Lance Corporal Morrow,
I need you to return to base with me.

1643
01:42:12,333 --> 01:42:14,583
I'll give you a few minutes
to grab your gear.

1644
01:42:53,125 --> 01:42:53,958
Hello?

1645
01:42:54,041 --> 01:42:57,500
<i>Luke wants you to know that
he's been charged with fraud and detained.</i>

1646
01:42:57,583 --> 01:43:00,833
<i>They've said you two</i> <i>have a fake marriage
in order to get benefits.</i>

1647
01:43:00,916 --> 01:43:01,916
Is this true?

1648
01:43:02,000 --> 01:43:03,166
Wait, where is Luke?

1649
01:43:03,250 --> 01:43:05,125
<i>I'm headed to base to see him now.</i>

1650
01:43:05,208 --> 01:43:06,833
<i>There's gonna be a trial in a few weeks.</i>

1651
01:43:06,916 --> 01:43:09,875
<i>Then you'll also be hearing from
the police about your role in all this.</i>

1652
01:43:09,958 --> 01:43:11,833
<i>- Was it all an act?
- Uh...</i>

1653
01:43:13,250 --> 01:43:14,250
No.

1654
01:43:14,291 --> 01:43:15,750
<i>Not... Not all of it.</i>

1655
01:43:16,958 --> 01:43:18,916
Even I thought you were good for him.

1656
01:43:21,041 --> 01:43:23,291
I thought you were bringing
my son back to me.

1657
01:44:37,125 --> 01:44:38,125
Hi.

1658
01:44:41,875 --> 01:44:42,916
All rise.

1659
01:44:50,791 --> 01:44:52,541
Good morning. Be seated.

1660
01:44:54,833 --> 01:44:57,125
We're here today for a hearing in the case

1661
01:44:57,208 --> 01:44:59,916
of Lance Corporal Luke A. Morrow.

1662
01:45:00,500 --> 01:45:02,791
Lance Corporal Morrow stands accused

1663
01:45:02,875 --> 01:45:07,666
of entering into a fraudulent marriage
in order to collect BAH

1664
01:45:07,750 --> 01:45:14,291
and FSA pay in violation
of article 132 of the UCMJ.

1665
01:45:14,875 --> 01:45:18,708
We have a signed affidavit
from Jonathan Deluca's testimony

1666
01:45:18,791 --> 01:45:21,041
of the fraudulent marriage.

1667
01:45:21,583 --> 01:45:25,750
Lance Corporal Morrow's wife,
Miss Salazar, is a civilian.

1668
01:45:25,833 --> 01:45:28,583
So, her case will be referred
to state authorities,

1669
01:45:28,666 --> 01:45:32,250
and they may pursue criminal charges.

1670
01:45:33,500 --> 01:45:37,125
They will have access
to the transcripts of these proceedings.

1671
01:45:44,750 --> 01:45:47,500
- I wanna make a statement.
- Lance Corporal, I can't advise that.

1672
01:45:47,583 --> 01:45:50,000
If you don't say anything,
we have a good chance of winning.

1673
01:45:50,083 --> 01:45:51,833
Tell the judge
I'd like to make a statement.

1674
01:45:51,916 --> 01:45:54,708
Lance Corporal Morrow, how do you plead?

1675
01:45:56,250 --> 01:45:59,041
Your Honor,
my client wishes to speak.

1676
01:46:00,041 --> 01:46:01,041
What?

1677
01:46:01,125 --> 01:46:02,458
Luke.

1678
01:46:05,416 --> 01:46:06,750
You may proceed.

1679
01:46:14,041 --> 01:46:15,041
Sir.

1680
01:46:18,000 --> 01:46:20,250
I coerced Miss Salazar into marrying me.

1681
01:46:21,791 --> 01:46:25,208
Um, she didn't know
that it violated military law.

1682
01:46:25,291 --> 01:46:27,041
- I assured her it didn't.
- No.

1683
01:46:27,625 --> 01:46:29,000
I bear full responsibility,

1684
01:46:29,083 --> 01:46:31,583
and I'm prepared
to face the consequences of my actions.

1685
01:46:37,166 --> 01:46:38,166
Very well.

1686
01:46:39,000 --> 01:46:41,083
Then I find you guilty.

1687
01:46:45,541 --> 01:46:47,083
Lance Corporal Morrow,

1688
01:46:47,166 --> 01:46:51,000
upon completion of your sentence,
you'll be discharged for bad conduct.

1689
01:46:51,083 --> 01:46:53,208
You will report
for your six-month sentence

1690
01:46:53,291 --> 01:46:55,416
tomorrow at 1700 hours.

1691
01:46:55,500 --> 01:46:58,125
Given the outcome of this trial,
this court will not

1692
01:46:58,208 --> 01:47:00,916
refer Miss Salazar's case
to the local authorities.

1693
01:47:04,791 --> 01:47:06,625
<i>Do you pledge to love this man?</i>

1694
01:47:07,208 --> 01:47:09,250
<i>To be true and loyal to him</i>

1695
01:47:09,333 --> 01:47:11,375

01:52:52,333 --> 01:52:53,958
Pick up, please.

1766
01:52:57,916 --> 01:52:58,958
Just give me a minute.

1767
01:53:06,500 --> 01:53:07,583

Now, you be good, huh?

1771
01:53:17,375 --> 01:53:18,415
You be good.

1772
01:53:18,458 --> 01:53:20,498
Don't you worry.
We'll take good care of her.

1773
01:53:20,541 --> 01:53:21,750
I'm gonna miss you.

1774
01:53:25,208 --> 01:53:26,291
Come here.

1775
01:53:28,000 --> 01:53:29,375
You're gonna be okay.

1776
01:53:29,958 --> 01:53:31,166
I'm proud of you, Son.

1777
01:53:37,875 --> 01:53:39,583
- Love y'all.
- Get out of here.

1778
01:53:43,000 --> 01:53:44,458
Oh. Oh, thank God.

1779
01:53:54,916 --> 01:53:56,083
- Hi.
- Hi.

1780
01:53:59,916 --> 01:54:03,041
I heard about the record deal, that's...

1781
01:54:03,125 --> 01:54:05,541
- That's really something, Cassie.
- Thank you.

1782
01:54:10,583 --> 01:54:12,791
We don't have much time, do we?

1783
01:54:13,375 --> 01:54:15,166
No. No, we don't.

1784
01:54:16,250 --> 01:54:17,625
Okay. Um...

1785
01:54:18,708 --> 01:54:21,083
Then here's what I have to say.

1786
01:54:21,916 --> 01:54:24,875
We vowed to
take care of each other.

1787
01:54:25,833 --> 01:54:29,416
In sickness and in health,
and... and we did that.

1788
01:54:32,458 --> 01:54:34,416
And I think this is a real marriage.

1789
01:54:37,166 --> 01:54:39,291
I think this is
the realest thing I've ever been in.

1790
01:54:39,375 --> 01:54:42,000
- I'm going away for six months.
- I wanna wait for you.

1791
01:54:42,750 --> 01:54:45,166
And I wanna sleep on the floor with you

1792
01:54:45,250 --> 01:54:46,625
when it's storming out.

1793
01:54:48,041 --> 01:54:50,750
And I want you to hear my songs first.

1794
01:54:53,333 --> 01:54:56,166
And I wanna watch you
put on your running shoes,

1795
01:54:56,250 --> 01:54:57,750
go out running,

1796
01:54:57,833 --> 01:55:00,500
and I wanna be the one
that you run back to.

1797
01:55:02,458 --> 01:55:03,916
Because I love you.

1798
01:55:18,125 --> 01:55:20,083
I love you too, Cassie Salazar.

1799
01:55:30,583 --> 01:55:32,708
Whoo!

1800
01:55:32,791 --> 01:55:34,671
Hit it, Bro!

1801
01:55:34,708 --> 01:55:36,750
Whoo!

1802
01:55:58,083 --> 01:56:00,875
You take good care
of this for me, you hear me?

1803
01:56:01,458 --> 01:56:02,833
Because it's real now.

1804
01:56:29,500 --> 01:56:31,083
I love you!

1805
01:56:33,250 --> 01:56:36,333
