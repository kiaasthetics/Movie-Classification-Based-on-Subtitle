<font color="#00ff00">www.podnapisi.net</font>

2
00:05:10,859 --> 00:05:12,818
Go past me children.

3
00:05:13,900 --> 00:05:16,059
There are some to my left

4
00:05:17,020 --> 00:05:18,258
and some ahead here.

5
00:06:45,179 --> 00:06:46,179
Yes.

6
00:06:47,460 --> 00:06:49,739
Sleep child sleep.

7
00:06:49,739 --> 00:06:52,018
Don't sit on me.

8
00:06:52,020 --> 00:06:53,219
I didn't sit on you.

9
00:06:54,340 --> 00:06:58,138
That's what happens when you stamp on my foot.

10
00:08:01,499 --> 00:08:04,219
You'd better not throw a
bucket of water over me.

11
00:08:04,220 --> 00:08:05,818
No, we'd never do that.

12
00:08:06,220 --> 00:08:07,698
It better not make me late.

13
00:08:11,220 --> 00:08:13,219
This way... and out.

14
00:08:15,460 --> 00:08:17,138
Watch out for the steps.

15
00:08:17,820 --> 00:08:20,499
Feel for it... and down. Perfect.

16
00:08:23,879 --> 00:08:26,679
Last step, and now turn around.

17
00:08:27,359 --> 00:08:29,719
Where you go. Wait. Stand here.

18
00:08:32,979 --> 00:08:34,658
Surprise.

19
00:08:35,899 --> 00:08:36,778
Is this for me?

20
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:37,739
Yes.

21
00:08:38,979 --> 00:08:39,499
Thank you.

22
00:08:39,499 --> 00:08:41,339
Happy birthday.

23
00:08:42,460 --> 00:08:43,859
Where did you get it?

24
00:08:43,859 --> 00:08:45,219
I have my sources.

25
00:08:46,100 --> 00:08:48,239
One, two, three passengers.

26
00:08:48,239 --> 00:08:49,339
Who wants the first ride?

27
00:08:49,340 --> 00:08:50,178
Me.

28
00:08:52,460 --> 00:08:53,099
You.

29
00:08:53,499 --> 00:08:54,699
You can have the first ride.

30
00:08:58,220 --> 00:09:00,099
The paint is still fresh.

31
00:09:00,100 --> 00:09:02,859
Annagret will have a green bottom.

32
00:09:24,899 --> 00:09:26,339
Coats, hags, off to school.

33
00:09:26,619 --> 00:09:27,859
Thank you, children.

34
00:09:30,859 --> 00:09:31,579
Goodbye.

35
00:09:35,180 --> 00:09:37,298
Inge, pull your socks up.

36
00:09:47,220 --> 00:09:50,018
Bye bye Daddy.

37
00:10:10,619 --> 00:10:12,018
Phlox.

38
00:10:24,540 --> 00:10:26,178
Would you like to smell a rose?

39
00:10:27,019 --> 00:10:30,339
Smell a rose. Yes. This one.

40
00:10:34,100 --> 00:10:35,298
This one is beautiful.

41
00:10:46,779 --> 00:10:49,499
Look, what a big dahlia.

42
00:10:52,019 --> 00:10:56,059
And a ladybird. Yes.

43
00:12:30,619 --> 00:12:31,499
Bronek.

44
00:12:49,100 --> 00:12:50,018
Marta.

45
00:12:55,300 --> 00:12:56,499
Upstairs please.

46
00:12:56,499 --> 00:12:58,619
Then come and see me.

47
00:13:01,100 --> 00:13:01,859
Sophie.

48
00:13:05,540 --> 00:13:06,219
Aniela, come.

49
00:13:17,859 --> 00:13:19,258
Choose something you like.

50
00:13:19,259 --> 00:13:20,219
Only one each.

51
00:13:20,220 --> 00:13:21,619
Take something.

52
00:14:28,259 --> 00:14:30,219
This one needs to be cleaned

53
00:14:30,220 --> 00:14:32,298
and the lining has to be mended.

54
00:14:32,300 --> 00:14:33,538
Be careful with it.

55
00:14:33,540 --> 00:14:34,339
Of course.

56
00:14:34,700 --> 00:14:36,099
Go back downstairs.

57
00:15:47,379 --> 00:15:49,258
The bees are flying.

58
00:15:49,859 --> 00:15:52,178
It is hot, isn't it?

59
00:15:52,540 --> 00:15:53,778
How was your journey?

60
00:15:54,580 --> 00:15:57,378
Long. But we're here now.

61
00:15:57,379 --> 00:15:59,418
Yes indeed. So, not too bad?

62
00:15:59,779 --> 00:16:00,939
No, not too bad.

63
00:16:01,820 --> 00:16:03,538
Easier than last time actually.

64
00:16:03,979 --> 00:16:06,898
Excellent. Well then, welcome back.

65
00:16:07,340 --> 00:16:09,418
Absolutely. We're glad to be here.

66
00:16:10,619 --> 00:16:12,378
Should we take our shoes off as well?

67
00:16:12,379 --> 00:16:13,298
No.

68
00:16:13,940 --> 00:16:16,339
Did you travel via Prague or Vienna?

69
00:16:17,019 --> 00:16:21,138
Prague. It is 56 minutes faster.

70
00:16:47,619 --> 00:16:49,138
She asked me where I got

71
00:16:49,139 --> 00:16:50,579
one of my jackets from.

72
00:16:50,580 --> 00:16:51,938
I said, "Canada."

73
00:16:51,940 --> 00:16:53,699
And she asked, "How did you get to Canada?"

74
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:56,459
She thought you meant the country?

75
00:16:56,460 --> 00:16:57,339
Yes, of course.

76
00:16:57,859 --> 00:16:59,099
An understandable mistake.

77
00:16:59,100 --> 00:17:01,018
The same thing happened when Helga Pattisch

78
00:17:01,019 --> 00:17:02,258
came for the first time.

79
00:17:03,820 --> 00:17:06,138
Out of all of the clothes, she chose a dress

80
00:17:06,139 --> 00:17:10,218
that belonged to some little
Jewess half her size.

81
00:17:10,219 --> 00:17:13,498
I could only pull the zipper up to here

82
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:15,019
and the dress came apart.

83
00:17:15,020 --> 00:17:17,218
And! Pulled and pulled at it.

84
00:17:17,219 --> 00:17:20,938
She just looked down at herself and said

85
00:17:20,939 --> 00:17:22,779
"I love this dress."

86
00:17:22,780 --> 00:17:24,658
In the end she took it.

87
00:17:24,659 --> 00:17:27,619
And she said, "I'll go on a diet."

88
00:17:31,580 --> 00:17:32,978
Would you like more coffee?

89
00:17:32,980 --> 00:17:34,378
Yes please. Thank you.

90
00:17:37,580 --> 00:17:38,658
You take it black?

91
00:17:38,659 --> 00:17:40,019
Black is good, thank you.

92
00:17:43,459 --> 00:17:45,859
Helga's husband only adopted

93
00:17:45,859 --> 00:17:49,259
that little Polish bay to keep her at home

94
00:17:51,899 --> 00:17:53,378
That's what she told me.

95
00:17:54,780 --> 00:17:56,819
And he hits her as well.

96
00:17:58,020 --> 00:17:58,859
I didn't know that.

97
00:17:58,859 --> 00:18:00,299
How do you know that?

98
00:18:02,300 --> 00:18:04,180
Haven't you noticed the bruises on her arms?

99
00:18:05,740 --> 00:18:07,738
I forgot to tell you something.

100
00:18:08,139 --> 00:18:11,698
Guess where I found this diamond?

101
00:18:12,459 --> 00:18:13,938
In the toothpaste

102
00:18:14,100 --> 00:18:15,539
No. Really?

103
00:18:16,060 --> 00:18:17,458
How clever you must have to be.

104
00:18:17,459 --> 00:18:18,819
Yes, they are very.

105
00:18:19,100 --> 00:18:20,619
I've ordered more toothpaste

106
00:18:20,619 --> 00:18:21,898
because you never know.

107
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:43,675
I think I told you above
the Schilling concert.

108
00:18:43,699 --> 00:18:46,395
About Brigitte Frank's ermine fur coat.

109
00:18:46,419 --> 00:18:48,539
Did I tell you about it?

110
00:18:48,899 --> 00:18:49,819
I don't think so.

111
00:18:49,820 --> 00:18:50,619
Look.

112
00:18:53,020 --> 00:18:54,539
She looks like an empress.

113
00:18:55,060 --> 00:18:57,938
The other side of it is the next chamber

114
00:18:57,939 --> 00:19:01,938
with the next load ready to burn

115
00:19:01,939 --> 00:19:04,019
once the pieces here

116
00:19:04,020 --> 00:19:07,178
have been completely incinerated.

117
00:19:07,179 --> 00:19:08,458
How long does it take?

118
00:19:08,459 --> 00:19:11,859
7 hours, 400 to 500 at a time.

119
00:19:11,859 --> 00:19:13,339
Closer to 500.

120
00:19:13,540 --> 00:19:15,819
So, once that has happened,

121
00:19:15,820 --> 00:19:19,218
you close this chimney,

122
00:19:19,219 --> 00:19:21,579
then simultaneously open the next.

123
00:19:21,580 --> 00:19:24,458
The fire will follow the air,

124
00:19:24,459 --> 00:19:27,418
through this baffle of course,

125
00:19:27,419 --> 00:19:31,099
into this chamber and then burn this load.

126
00:19:32,219 --> 00:19:36,658
The chamber directly opposite
the combustion zone,

127
00:19:37,179 --> 00:19:39,978
which burns at roughly 1,000 degrees,

128
00:19:40,459 --> 00:19:47,539
has by now cooled to around 40 degrees.

129
00:19:47,540 --> 00:19:49,579
Cool enough to unload the ash

130
00:19:49,580 --> 00:19:51,779
and then reload the chamber.

131
00:19:52,260 --> 00:19:54,099
So, this chamber is cooling

132
00:19:54,100 --> 00:19:55,658
while this one is heating up?

133
00:19:55,659 --> 00:20:00,738
Correct. The process moves one chamber over,

134
00:20:00,740 --> 00:20:02,378
counterclockwise.

135
00:20:02,699 --> 00:20:07,738
So, burn, cool, unload, reload.

136
00:20:08,260 --> 00:20:09,178
And...

137
00:20:10,100 --> 00:20:11,378
Continuously.

138
00:20:23,580 --> 00:20:24,658
Cheers.

139
00:20:27,780 --> 00:20:28,779
Dilla.

140
00:20:36,340 --> 00:20:38,339
Happy birthday, Commandant.

141
00:20:38,340 --> 00:20:40,738
It is an honour to serve under you.

142
00:20:40,740 --> 00:20:41,458
Thank you.

143
00:20:42,619 --> 00:20:43,978
Happy birthday, Commandant.

144
00:20:44,260 --> 00:20:44,938
Thank you.

145
00:20:45,500 --> 00:20:47,259
Happy birthday, Commandant.

146
00:20:47,820 --> 00:20:48,539
Thank you.

147
00:20:49,939 --> 00:20:51,539
That is a rifle.

148
00:20:52,260 --> 00:20:55,059
And this is also a rifle.

149
00:20:55,419 --> 00:20:58,779
And here is one with a pistol,

150
00:20:58,780 --> 00:21:00,978
and another rifle here.

151
00:21:24,100 --> 00:21:25,099
Do you hear that?

152
00:21:26,340 --> 00:21:30,658
It's a bittern. A heron.
A Eurasian Grey heron.

153
00:22:06,340 --> 00:22:09,779
You cried like this too.

154
00:22:10,300 --> 00:22:12,178
You were even louder.

155
00:22:13,980 --> 00:22:16,059
What's going on with her?

156
00:22:16,060 --> 00:22:17,458
She's strong, isn't she?

157
00:22:20,139 --> 00:22:22,019
I'd like to try mine now.

158
00:23:33,179 --> 00:23:34,539
What are you doing?

159
00:23:35,939 --> 00:23:37,138
What are you doing?

160
00:23:37,139 --> 00:23:38,059
I'm looking.

161
00:23:38,740 --> 00:23:39,819
At what?

162
00:23:40,300 --> 00:23:41,059
Teeth.

163
00:23:49,500 --> 00:23:50,619
What are you doing?

164
00:23:51,060 --> 00:23:52,138
Nothing.

165
00:26:14,379 --> 00:26:15,539
What are you doing here?

166
00:26:16,540 --> 00:26:18,138
I'm handing out sugar.

167
00:26:19,100 --> 00:26:19,938
Who to?

168
00:26:21,020 --> 00:26:22,259
I'm looking.

169
00:26:26,260 --> 00:26:27,218
Come.

170
00:26:41,859 --> 00:26:45,938
Then, a little white bird flew past

171
00:26:45,939 --> 00:26:49,418
to guide them out of the forest.

172
00:26:50,619 --> 00:26:52,539
Soon they arrived at a huge lake.

173
00:26:52,540 --> 00:26:55,978
They were puzzled as they
did not know how to cross it.

174
00:26:56,899 --> 00:27:01,738
Suddenly, a big beautiful swan
came swimming towards them.

175
00:27:03,060 --> 00:27:05,738
"Beautiful swan, please be our boat."

176
00:27:06,540 --> 00:27:10,579
The swan bent its neck and came to the shore.

177
00:27:35,780 --> 00:27:37,498
Bracht phoned the house.

178
00:27:38,859 --> 00:27:41,339
Yes, while you were outside for your toast.

179
00:27:41,619 --> 00:27:42,658
I forgot to tell you.

180
00:27:42,659 --> 00:27:44,859
He said he'd call back tomorrow, midday.

181
00:27:51,219 --> 00:27:52,138
Rudolf.

182
00:27:55,139 --> 00:27:58,178
Will you take me to that spa in Italy again?

183
00:28:02,500 --> 00:28:04,339
All that pampering.

184
00:28:05,980 --> 00:28:09,938
And the walks. And that nice couple we met.

185
00:28:16,260 --> 00:28:17,978
Is she wandering around again?

186
00:28:18,500 --> 00:28:19,138
No.

187
00:28:21,139 --> 00:28:22,498
And that man

188
00:28:24,219 --> 00:28:26,658
who played the accordion to the cows?

189
00:28:27,699 --> 00:28:28,898
They loved it.

190
00:28:29,459 --> 00:28:31,978
It was so funny.

191
00:28:33,060 --> 00:28:34,938
All looking at him like this.

192
00:28:43,379 --> 00:28:44,259
Will you?

193
00:28:45,020 --> 00:28:45,738
What?

194
00:28:45,740 --> 00:28:47,498
Well, take me back there.

195
00:28:48,419 --> 00:28:49,299
When?

196
00:28:51,300 --> 00:28:52,579
I don't know when.

197
00:28:59,419 --> 00:29:00,698
You smell nice.

198
00:29:02,419 --> 00:29:03,698
It's French.

199
00:29:16,859 --> 00:29:18,418
Oink, oink.

200
00:29:33,179 --> 00:29:36,898
Chocolate. If you see it. Any goodies.

201
00:30:17,659 --> 00:30:20,418
To the head of the Party Chancellery

202
00:30:20,419 --> 00:30:21,579
Reichsleiter Bormann.

203
00:30:21,580 --> 00:30:22,458
Personal.

204
00:30:23,179 --> 00:30:24,498
Dear Reichsleiter

205
00:30:25,980 --> 00:30:29,859
I have learned that the commandant
of the gigantic K.L. Auschwitz

206
00:30:29,859 --> 00:30:31,339
Obersturmbannführer Höss

207
00:30:31,659 --> 00:30:33,059
also well known to you,

208
00:30:33,060 --> 00:30:34,378
is to be transferred.

209
00:30:35,139 --> 00:30:37,779
Comrade Höss has made
unprecedented achievements

210
00:30:37,780 --> 00:30:39,539
over four years of painstaking work.

211
00:30:39,939 --> 00:30:43,579
I witnessed the construction
of this great camp close up

212
00:30:43,580 --> 00:30:45,218
so can attest.

213
00:30:45,780 --> 00:30:47,938
Reichsführer Himmler himself acknowledges

214
00:30:47,939 --> 00:30:50,698
the uniqueness of what he built.

215
00:30:51,540 --> 00:30:54,259
Now it is said that the
task is too big for him

216
00:30:54,260 --> 00:30:57,099
and that someone must take his place.

217
00:30:57,899 --> 00:31:00,339
Höss knows prisoner use inside out

218
00:31:01,060 --> 00:31:04,218
has close contacts with the
Silesian armaments industry

219
00:31:04,459 --> 00:31:06,019
and has brought groundbreaking ideas

220
00:31:06,020 --> 00:31:07,539
to the whole field of KL practice.

221
00:31:07,899 --> 00:31:09,418
He is a model settler farmer

222
00:31:09,419 --> 00:31:11,779
and an exemplary German pioneer of the East.

223
00:31:12,399 --> 00:31:14,759
His particular strength is
turning theory into practice.

224
00:31:15,219 --> 00:31:17,779
I will refrain from listing more qualities

225
00:31:17,780 --> 00:31:21,059
which prove a change in his
command is not possible.

226
00:31:21,939 --> 00:31:23,579
Therefore, could you please speak

227
00:31:23,580 --> 00:31:25,238
to the Reichsführer as soon as possible

228
00:31:25,500 --> 00:31:28,178
to prevent the transfer of Comrade Höss.

229
00:31:28,899 --> 00:31:30,938
I would be very grateful for a brief reply.

230
00:31:31,740 --> 00:31:32,619
Hell Hitler.

231
00:31:32,820 --> 00:31:35,178
Gauleiter Fritz Bracht.

232
00:31:39,500 --> 00:31:40,619
Can I do it now?

233
00:31:40,619 --> 00:31:41,498
In a moment.

234
00:31:43,820 --> 00:31:45,938
Did you know that storks

235
00:31:45,939 --> 00:31:47,259
fly as far as Africa?

236
00:31:48,619 --> 00:31:50,339
How far do you think they fly?

237
00:31:50,340 --> 00:31:52,019
How many kilometers?

238
00:31:52,020 --> 00:31:52,938
300?

239
00:31:53,260 --> 00:31:54,498
More.

240
00:32:11,100 --> 00:32:12,418
All these weeds here.

241
00:32:15,540 --> 00:32:17,698
You are what you say.

242
00:32:17,980 --> 00:32:19,378
You are what you say.

243
00:32:19,379 --> 00:32:20,819
Cows find this funny.

244
00:32:20,820 --> 00:32:23,099
The whale farm is roaring,
because you are so boring.

245
00:32:23,500 --> 00:32:24,619
Cows find this funny.

246
00:32:24,619 --> 00:32:26,898
The whole farm is roaring,
because you are so boring.

247
00:32:27,179 --> 00:32:28,898
No, you're boring.

248
00:33:45,859 --> 00:33:46,698
All is well.

249
00:33:48,300 --> 00:33:49,658
I hate you.

250
00:33:49,659 --> 00:33:52,299
Keep your eyes closed, or it'll hurt.

251
00:33:52,300 --> 00:33:53,178
I know.

252
00:33:53,179 --> 00:33:56,498
Once more. All good. Come here.

253
00:34:25,819 --> 00:34:28,179
We have 10 rinse your eyes.

254
00:34:28,179 --> 00:34:29,898
Everything's fine. You'll live.

255
00:34:39,100 --> 00:34:42,498
...with which 60,000 Italian spectators

256
00:34:42,500 --> 00:34:45,259
showered their victorious national team.

257
00:34:45,819 --> 00:34:48,819
We will be able to share in their delight.

258
00:34:49,659 --> 00:34:51,739
How long it's been since Milan saw

259
00:34:51,739 --> 00:34:53,978
their beloved Squadra Azzurra?

260
00:34:53,980 --> 00:34:57,139
And now they have returned with a 4-0 victory

261
00:34:57,139 --> 00:34:59,938
to the arena of their many triumphs.

262
00:35:00,540 --> 00:35:03,578
Can you imagine the celebration?

263
00:35:03,580 --> 00:35:06,538
4-0 against their old rivals Spain,

264
00:35:06,540 --> 00:35:09,659
who are again aspiring to a position of power

265
00:35:09,659 --> 00:35:11,418
in European football,

266
00:35:11,420 --> 00:35:14,659
as we Germans saw with our own eyes

267
00:35:14,659 --> 00:35:16,259
in Berlin last Sunday.

268
00:35:16,860 --> 00:35:19,618
But don't let the result fool you.

269
00:35:19,619 --> 00:35:22,098
4-0 was the final score.

270
00:35:22,100 --> 00:35:23,659
But at half time

271
00:35:23,659 --> 00:35:27,659
this thrilling Italian-Spanish encounter

272
00:35:27,659 --> 00:35:28,938
stood at 0-0.

273
00:35:29,540 --> 00:35:30,219
Hang up.

274
00:35:35,500 --> 00:35:36,418
Fritz.

275
00:35:38,580 --> 00:35:39,219
Go on.

276
00:35:42,460 --> 00:35:43,819
What does it say?

277
00:35:54,460 --> 00:35:55,378
Well.

278
00:35:57,100 --> 00:35:59,819
No, you wrote a very powerful
letter on my behalf.

279
00:35:59,819 --> 00:36:01,578
Their minds were obviously made up.

280
00:36:03,739 --> 00:36:05,139
I'd better tell my wife.

281
00:36:09,699 --> 00:36:10,378
She might.

282
00:36:11,619 --> 00:36:13,739
The train stopped for ages at Krakow.

283
00:36:13,739 --> 00:36:14,739
How frustrating.

284
00:36:16,659 --> 00:36:18,339
And it was so hot.

285
00:36:18,860 --> 00:36:22,179
A lady fainted next to me, it was that hot.

286
00:36:22,900 --> 00:36:24,779
She's moving here with her husband,

287
00:36:24,779 --> 00:36:27,259
who's an engineer. He's a lot older.

288
00:36:27,259 --> 00:36:28,139
Yes.

289
00:36:28,139 --> 00:36:30,299
They've both got jobs at a new factory.

290
00:36:30,299 --> 00:36:31,259
Siemens.

291
00:36:31,259 --> 00:36:33,018
Yes. That's possible.

292
00:36:34,380 --> 00:36:38,739
All the big companies are here, he said.

293
00:36:38,739 --> 00:36:40,098
Yes, yes.

294
00:36:41,179 --> 00:36:44,458
Don't you need to get on?

295
00:36:44,460 --> 00:36:46,018
Yes. I'd better.

296
00:36:46,020 --> 00:36:47,578
I'll show Mum to the girls' room.

297
00:36:52,339 --> 00:36:53,299
Are you ready?

298
00:36:54,060 --> 00:36:55,259
You'll have Heideraud’s bed

299
00:36:55,819 --> 00:36:57,739
and she'll get in with Inge-Brigitt.

300
00:36:57,739 --> 00:36:59,139
You don't mind, do you?

301
00:36:59,139 --> 00:37:00,058
- Of course not.

302
00:37:00,339 --> 00:37:02,978
The house looks big, but it actually isn't.

303
00:37:02,980 --> 00:37:04,699
The first thing we did

304
00:37:04,699 --> 00:37:07,299
was install central heating.

305
00:37:07,299 --> 00:37:11,378
It gets so cold in winter.

306
00:37:11,380 --> 00:37:12,819
You wouldn't believe it.

307
00:37:27,819 --> 00:37:28,978
Hand-painted.

308
00:37:28,980 --> 00:37:29,538
Really?

309
00:37:29,540 --> 00:37:30,418
Yes.

310
00:37:40,580 --> 00:37:43,139
This is Heideraud's bed here.

311
00:37:43,460 --> 00:37:45,699
This is lovely.

312
00:37:46,420 --> 00:37:46,978
Truly.

313
00:37:49,500 --> 00:37:51,458
Such a lovely room.

314
00:37:52,020 --> 00:37:55,699
The top two drawers are for you.

315
00:37:55,940 --> 00:37:57,978
Yes, that's more than enough.

316
00:37:59,179 --> 00:38:00,259
Such beautiful flowers.

317
00:38:09,819 --> 00:38:11,139
Yes, try it.

318
00:38:11,900 --> 00:38:13,018
But I'm sleeping here?

319
00:38:13,020 --> 00:38:15,299
Yes, but they're both...

320
00:38:16,819 --> 00:38:17,538
...the same.

321
00:38:25,219 --> 00:38:26,179
My girl.

322
00:38:26,500 --> 00:38:28,458
That's spinach strudel, apple strudel,

323
00:38:28,460 --> 00:38:29,739
potato salad.

324
00:38:30,299 --> 00:38:32,018
And your cinnamon rolls.

325
00:38:32,500 --> 00:38:33,659
My recipe?

326
00:38:40,460 --> 00:38:41,659
Very nice.

327
00:38:42,219 --> 00:38:42,898
My god.

328
00:38:44,460 --> 00:38:46,018
Subject:

329
00:38:46,020 --> 00:38:49,139
Lilac bushes by the commandants
guard barracks.

330
00:38:53,060 --> 00:38:56,058
From now on, SS members who pick lilacs

331
00:38:57,420 --> 00:39:03,699
in a thoughtless and blatant manner

332
00:39:05,100 --> 00:39:07,139
so that the bushes bleed

333
00:39:08,179 --> 00:39:10,098
will be punished.

334
00:39:12,739 --> 00:39:14,299
I expect the SS members,

335
00:39:14,299 --> 00:39:17,058
if they wish to take some,

336
00:39:18,860 --> 00:39:20,418
to do it in a way

337
00:39:20,420 --> 00:39:22,179
that does not damage the bushes.

338
00:39:24,540 --> 00:39:27,659
In the interest of our whole community,

339
00:39:27,659 --> 00:39:29,299
I hope you understand

340
00:39:30,860 --> 00:39:32,259
that the lilac bushes

341
00:39:33,100 --> 00:39:35,058
are intended to decorate our entire camp

342
00:39:35,339 --> 00:39:38,458
both now and in the future.

343
00:39:41,540 --> 00:39:43,538
Jews in the house?

344
00:39:44,460 --> 00:39:46,578
The Jews are over the other side of the wall.

345
00:39:46,980 --> 00:39:48,259
They're local girls.

346
00:39:49,020 --> 00:39:50,418
Say hello to grandma.

347
00:39:53,139 --> 00:39:54,378
Hello.

348
00:39:58,020 --> 00:39:59,299
My God.

349
00:39:59,940 --> 00:40:04,538
He's got so big, and you have such nice hair.

350
00:40:06,420 --> 00:40:08,618
I think it's your turn to push, isn't it Hans?

351
00:40:08,619 --> 00:40:10,058
Inge pushed you before

352
00:40:10,060 --> 00:40:11,378
and now it's your turn. Go on.

353
00:40:12,100 --> 00:40:13,098
Let's go.

354
00:40:19,500 --> 00:40:21,058
This is all us.

355
00:40:22,299 --> 00:40:23,659
There's a grape vine.

356
00:40:24,460 --> 00:40:26,098
Obviously, it'll grow.

357
00:40:36,819 --> 00:40:38,378
It's huge.

358
00:40:39,299 --> 00:40:40,898
I'm speechless.

359
00:40:42,580 --> 00:40:44,659
It's all my design.

360
00:40:44,659 --> 00:40:46,179
All the planting and everything.

361
00:40:46,179 --> 00:40:50,018
The greenhouse, the gazebo at the end.

362
00:40:50,020 --> 00:40:51,219
Is that a pool?

363
00:40:51,580 --> 00:40:52,259
Yes.

364
00:40:52,420 --> 00:40:54,819
I have gardeners. I couldn't do it alone.

365
00:40:54,819 --> 00:40:55,739
With a slide?

366
00:40:56,179 --> 00:40:57,179
Heddy.

367
00:40:59,420 --> 00:41:00,578
Do you like it?

368
00:41:00,980 --> 00:41:03,259
Of course I like it. How could I not?

369
00:41:05,940 --> 00:41:09,458
This was a field three years ago.

370
00:41:10,739 --> 00:41:11,859
No.

371
00:41:13,580 --> 00:41:16,659
We just had the lower garden by the street.

372
00:41:17,060 --> 00:41:18,659
And the house had a flat roof.

373
00:41:18,659 --> 00:41:20,819
It's hard to believe.

374
00:41:23,380 --> 00:41:25,659
And that's the camp wall?

375
00:41:25,659 --> 00:41:27,339
Yes, that's the camp wall.

376
00:41:27,339 --> 00:41:29,898
We planted more vines at the back

377
00:41:29,900 --> 00:41:31,819
to grow and cover it.

378
00:41:32,659 --> 00:41:34,378
Maybe Esther Silberman is over there.

379
00:41:34,380 --> 00:41:35,339
Which one was she?

380
00:41:35,339 --> 00:41:36,859
The one I used to clean for.

381
00:41:37,779 --> 00:41:40,098
She was the one who had the book readings.

382
00:41:41,060 --> 00:41:42,938
God knows what they were up to.

383
00:41:43,219 --> 00:41:44,418
Bolshevik stuff.

384
00:41:44,940 --> 00:41:45,819
Jewish stuff.

385
00:41:47,139 --> 00:41:48,779
And I got outbid on her curtains

386
00:41:50,460 --> 00:41:52,618
at the street auction.

387
00:41:52,900 --> 00:41:54,378
Her opposite, she got them.

388
00:41:54,940 --> 00:41:56,779
I loved those curtains.

389
00:41:58,940 --> 00:42:01,458
These flowers are so beautiful.

390
00:42:01,940 --> 00:42:03,418
The azaleas there.

391
00:42:04,060 --> 00:42:05,578
There are also vegetables.

392
00:42:06,380 --> 00:42:11,458
A few herbs. Rosemary.
Beetroot. This is fennel.

393
00:42:12,139 --> 00:42:13,739
Sunflowers.

394
00:42:17,779 --> 00:42:22,735
And here is kohlrabi. The
children love to eat it.

395
00:42:22,980 --> 00:42:27,630
Cabbage. Kale. Runner beans.

396
00:42:28,580 --> 00:42:29,618
Pumpkins.

397
00:42:30,500 --> 00:42:31,819
Potatoes and more.

398
00:42:38,380 --> 00:42:41,859
We have bees over here to provide our honey.

399
00:42:42,980 --> 00:42:44,418
It's a paradise garden.

400
00:42:46,219 --> 00:42:47,819
And Rudolf is okay?

401
00:42:47,819 --> 00:42:49,418
Yes, he's fine.

402
00:42:49,860 --> 00:42:52,860
Working non-stop, even when he's home.

403
00:42:54,139 --> 00:42:55,538
Which he loves.

404
00:42:56,699 --> 00:42:58,378
He's a busy bee.

405
00:42:58,380 --> 00:43:00,339
He is. Non-stop.

406
00:43:00,339 --> 00:43:03,299
And under pressure like you wouldn't believe.

407
00:43:06,259 --> 00:43:07,699
And you're okay?

408
00:43:10,020 --> 00:43:11,139
Do I look okay?

409
00:43:19,380 --> 00:43:21,898
Rudi calls me the Queen of Auschwitz.

410
00:43:32,139 --> 00:43:33,179
Honestly.

411
00:43:33,179 --> 00:43:35,739
To have all this.

412
00:43:40,380 --> 00:43:42,978
You really have landed on your feet, my child.

413
00:43:46,940 --> 00:43:48,859
The linden trees are turning yellow.

414
00:43:50,060 --> 00:43:52,739
It smelled so nice when they were flowering.

415
00:43:56,900 --> 00:43:59,299
This will grow and cover everything.

416
00:44:00,500 --> 00:44:02,618
You'll see next time you visit.

417
00:44:07,420 --> 00:44:08,219
No.

418
00:44:11,860 --> 00:44:12,739
Stop it.

419
00:45:22,940 --> 00:45:28,339
The heartfelt time we spent in the Hoss house

420
00:45:29,380 --> 00:45:32,618
will always be

421
00:45:32,619 --> 00:45:37,339
among our most beautiful holiday memories.

422
00:45:37,339 --> 00:45:39,739
In the East lies our tomorrow.

423
00:45:40,460 --> 00:45:45,739
Thanks for your National Socialist hospitality.

424
00:45:46,940 --> 00:45:51,498
And this was from... Willy... Billy...

425
00:47:07,299 --> 00:47:09,458
Hans says you have his sandals.

426
00:47:13,619 --> 00:47:15,259
We have to leave, Mutzi.

427
00:47:17,259 --> 00:47:18,299
Leave where?

428
00:47:18,779 --> 00:47:22,018
Here. We have to go. We're being transferred.

429
00:47:24,100 --> 00:47:24,739
Sorry, what?

430
00:47:24,739 --> 00:47:26,139
We're being transferred.

431
00:47:28,420 --> 00:47:29,139
To where?

432
00:47:29,139 --> 00:47:30,538
Oranienburg.

433
00:47:31,980 --> 00:47:32,898
What?

434
00:47:33,460 --> 00:47:35,458
They're swapping me for Arthur Liebehenschel.

435
00:47:35,460 --> 00:47:36,659
He comes here.

436
00:47:37,980 --> 00:47:39,819
I take over as Deputy Inspector.

437
00:47:45,619 --> 00:47:49,699
If you've known this for a
while, why tell me now?

438
00:47:50,900 --> 00:47:52,378
There was no good moment to say it.

439
00:47:52,380 --> 00:47:53,699
You've said it now.

440
00:47:54,339 --> 00:47:55,299
Where are you going?

441
00:47:55,299 --> 00:47:56,339
To get the sandals.

442
00:48:00,259 --> 00:48:01,618
When did you find out?

443
00:48:01,619 --> 00:48:03,259
Pohl told me last week.

444
00:48:03,259 --> 00:48:04,819
I tried to make it go away.

445
00:48:11,179 --> 00:48:12,938
Then call, Bormann.

446
00:48:13,380 --> 00:48:15,179
I've tried Bormann.

447
00:48:15,420 --> 00:48:16,618
Should I go to Hitler now?

448
00:48:16,619 --> 00:48:17,538
Well, yes.

449
00:48:20,540 --> 00:48:21,179
Rudolf.

450
00:48:28,380 --> 00:48:29,018
Rudolf.

451
00:48:31,659 --> 00:48:33,739
Don't turn your back on me.

452
00:48:35,420 --> 00:48:36,898
Stop.

453
00:48:37,060 --> 00:48:39,058
Calm down. Go back to the party.

454
00:48:42,100 --> 00:48:44,272
You can't do this to me.

455
00:48:49,900 --> 00:48:51,458
What is this? Marta.

456
00:48:53,940 --> 00:48:54,699
Mrs Höss?

457
00:48:54,699 --> 00:48:56,498
What's this, "Mrs Höss? Mrs Höss?"

458
00:48:56,500 --> 00:48:57,618
I'll show you Mrs Höss.

459
00:48:57,619 --> 00:48:58,659
Mop it up.

460
00:48:59,380 --> 00:49:01,219
Don't forget you live well in our house.

461
00:49:01,219 --> 00:49:02,259
Bloody hell.

462
00:49:04,020 --> 00:49:04,978
Now.

463
00:49:13,219 --> 00:49:14,578
Bloody hell.

464
00:50:13,699 --> 00:50:15,259
Why are they transferring you?

465
00:50:16,819 --> 00:50:18,299
Structural changes.

466
00:50:18,659 --> 00:50:19,699
What does that mean?

467
00:50:20,380 --> 00:50:21,819
They weren't specific.

468
00:50:21,819 --> 00:50:23,378
But I'm not the only one being moved.

469
00:50:23,619 --> 00:50:25,179
There are lots of us.

470
00:50:28,980 --> 00:50:29,859
When?

471
00:50:29,980 --> 00:50:30,618
Soon.

472
00:50:30,779 --> 00:50:31,898
How soon?

473
00:50:32,020 --> 00:50:33,339
I'm waiting to be told.

474
00:50:41,639 --> 00:50:43,978
If it's about the investigation
they should call Himmler.

475
00:50:44,819 --> 00:50:45,859
He encouraged us.

476
00:50:46,020 --> 00:50:46,578
No.

477
00:50:48,659 --> 00:50:49,618
So it's not that?

478
00:50:49,619 --> 00:50:51,018
It's a political matter.

479
00:50:53,060 --> 00:50:53,819
Then go to Hitler.

480
00:50:54,060 --> 00:50:55,098
Don't be ridiculous.

481
00:50:55,100 --> 00:50:56,179
It's not ridiculous.

482
00:50:56,179 --> 00:50:58,659
You're the one who carries out his orders

483
00:50:58,779 --> 00:51:00,378
once you peel away the layers.

484
00:51:00,380 --> 00:51:03,779
We have to face facts. We have to leave.

485
00:51:04,739 --> 00:51:05,498
No.

486
00:51:05,500 --> 00:51:07,259
You have to leave.

487
00:51:11,339 --> 00:51:12,098
Yes.

488
00:51:13,940 --> 00:51:16,098
Your work is in Oranienburg now.

489
00:51:16,100 --> 00:51:19,139
Mine is raising our children,

490
00:51:19,139 --> 00:51:20,339
and I'll do that from here.

491
00:51:26,020 --> 00:51:28,699
I never thought that you wouldn't be with me.

492
00:51:30,540 --> 00:51:31,859
Never crossed my mind.

493
00:51:32,699 --> 00:51:35,578
They'd have to drag me out of here.

494
00:51:36,619 --> 00:51:38,219
You know that.

495
00:51:42,500 --> 00:51:43,898
This is our home.

496
00:51:48,380 --> 00:51:51,139
We're living how we dreamed we would.

497
00:51:51,139 --> 00:51:54,179
Since we were 17. Beyond how we dreamed.

498
00:51:56,259 --> 00:51:57,955
Out of the city finally.

499
00:51:57,980 --> 00:52:00,538
Everything we want. On our doorstep.

500
00:52:01,020 --> 00:52:03,739
And our children are strong,
healthy and happy.

501
00:52:07,339 --> 00:52:08,739
Everything the Fuhrer said

502
00:52:08,739 --> 00:52:10,578
about how to live is how we do.

503
00:52:10,580 --> 00:52:12,299
Go East. Living space.

504
00:52:12,299 --> 00:52:13,538
This is our living space.

505
00:52:27,380 --> 00:52:29,339
I know you agree with me.

506
00:52:33,420 --> 00:52:35,378
Arthur can find somewhere else to live.

507
00:52:35,380 --> 00:52:37,058
He doesn't need to take our home.

508
00:52:37,060 --> 00:52:38,699
You should make it a condition.

509
00:52:38,699 --> 00:52:40,299
It's the least they can do.

510
00:52:42,659 --> 00:52:46,098
He'll want a townhouse, anyway.

511
00:52:50,339 --> 00:52:51,699
Rudolf?

512
00:52:54,580 --> 00:52:55,779
I heard you.

513
00:52:57,500 --> 00:52:58,418
So?

514
00:52:59,020 --> 00:53:00,339
I'll ask.

515
00:53:13,020 --> 00:53:14,978
You'll be working all the time.

516
00:53:14,980 --> 00:53:15,538
Yes.

517
00:53:16,739 --> 00:53:18,378
We'd never see you.

518
00:53:18,380 --> 00:53:19,018
No.

519
00:53:29,500 --> 00:53:31,739
I'll miss you, of course.

520
00:53:31,940 --> 00:53:33,938
But you'll come home when you can.

521
00:53:41,900 --> 00:53:43,458
I‘ll be...

522
00:53:44,500 --> 00:53:47,739
with you. Just like you'll be with me.

523
00:54:01,219 --> 00:54:02,018
Yes?

524
00:54:14,460 --> 00:54:16,058
And after the war

525
00:54:18,139 --> 00:54:20,378
when everything is over, we'll farm.

526
00:54:20,380 --> 00:54:22,018
Like we said.

527
00:55:01,779 --> 00:55:03,458
Do you all understand?

528
00:55:03,460 --> 00:55:04,659
Yes.

529
00:55:09,460 --> 00:55:11,699
So, I'll be missing your birthday.

530
00:55:15,380 --> 00:55:17,659
And maybe even our anniversary.

531
00:55:18,179 --> 00:55:20,219
Depending on how long I'll be gone.

532
00:55:22,179 --> 00:55:23,498
So, those are some of the things

533
00:55:23,500 --> 00:55:25,098
that definitely add to the struggle.

534
00:55:27,779 --> 00:55:29,418
But the life we enjoy

535
00:55:30,900 --> 00:55:32,699
is very much worth the sacrifice.

536
00:55:36,619 --> 00:55:37,779
It's time for bed.

537
00:55:41,500 --> 00:55:43,618
Hans, your plate.

538
00:55:48,940 --> 00:55:49,898
Be calm.

539
00:57:44,060 --> 00:57:45,938
It'll be hard for you too.

540
00:57:47,739 --> 00:57:48,859
I know that.

541
00:57:50,339 --> 00:57:51,819
Don't you think I know that?

542
00:57:52,100 --> 00:57:53,139
I know that.

543
00:57:57,259 --> 00:57:58,058
I love you.

544
00:58:03,299 --> 00:58:05,058
I love you, my beauty.

545
00:58:17,259 --> 00:58:21,139
Call Walter Dürrfeld first thing and
see if he can join us at selection.

546
00:58:21,619 --> 00:58:23,578
Tell him they're Dutch

547
00:58:23,580 --> 00:58:25,339
and he can have his pick.

548
00:58:26,339 --> 00:58:28,699
Otherwise, I'll see him at the IG lunch.

549
00:58:30,819 --> 00:58:33,018
Letter to Messrs. Prifer and Sander,

550
00:58:33,020 --> 00:58:34,058
Topf and Sons.

551
00:58:35,179 --> 00:58:37,139
Subject: New Crematorium.

552
00:58:38,940 --> 00:58:41,699
I'm glad you were able to
make the journey last week.

553
00:58:43,940 --> 00:58:47,219
SS-Obersturmbannführer
Bischoff and I both agree

554
00:58:47,219 --> 00:58:50,739
the ring crematorium is
definitely the answer.

555
00:58:52,380 --> 00:58:54,058
What a difference it will make.

556
00:58:54,380 --> 00:58:55,339
Bravo.

557
00:58:58,100 --> 00:58:59,538
I welcome your...

558
00:59:00,380 --> 00:59:02,058
I welcome your suggestion

559
00:59:02,460 --> 00:59:04,659
that the design should be patented

560
00:59:04,659 --> 00:59:07,058
in order to secure priority.

561
00:59:07,060 --> 00:59:09,058
I will follow up with a letter of intent.

562
00:59:11,659 --> 00:59:12,739
You should be aware,

563
00:59:12,739 --> 00:59:14,418
I've been promoted to Deputy Inspector

564
00:59:14,420 --> 00:59:17,659
of concentration camps at the IKL.

565
00:59:18,020 --> 00:59:18,699
Come.

566
00:59:22,779 --> 00:59:25,498
And therefore, future communications

567
00:59:25,500 --> 00:59:27,618
will be from Oranienburg-Berlin.

568
00:59:29,699 --> 00:59:32,259
The focus there is now on labour.

569
00:59:36,779 --> 00:59:39,898
Of course, this direction will affect our plans

570
00:59:43,100 --> 00:59:45,739
and though it pains me to leave Auschwitz

571
00:59:46,819 --> 00:59:50,779
I believe I'll be in a better position

572
00:59:51,860 --> 00:59:54,058
to push for funds and materials

573
00:59:55,020 --> 00:59:56,018
from there.

574
00:59:57,139 --> 00:59:58,299
Heil Hitler. Et cetera.

575
01:00:28,339 --> 01:00:30,578
Letter to Gruppenführer Glücks, IKL.

576
01:00:32,380 --> 01:00:33,618
Subject: Transfer.

577
01:00:35,860 --> 01:00:37,538
Dear Gruppenführer Glücks,

578
01:00:38,900 --> 01:00:42,618
I would like my family to remain

579
01:00:42,619 --> 01:00:46,139
at 88 Bielitzstrasse, KL Auschwitz

580
01:00:46,139 --> 01:00:48,098
for the duration of my transfer.

581
01:00:49,259 --> 01:00:51,299
It would be a great favour to me

582
01:00:51,299 --> 01:00:53,058
for this to be permitted.

583
01:00:53,980 --> 01:00:57,098
I must stress what a wonderful environment

584
01:00:57,100 --> 01:01:01,458
Hedwig is making for the
children since settling here.

585
01:01:02,540 --> 01:01:05,538
An inspiration in many ways

586
01:01:05,540 --> 01:01:08,618
for our new German community in the East.

587
01:01:09,460 --> 01:01:11,898
If this is acceptable,

588
01:01:12,339 --> 01:01:14,179
provision of a simple lodging for myself

589
01:01:14,179 --> 01:01:15,699
in Oranienburg will suffice.

590
01:01:16,940 --> 01:01:20,458
I would be very grateful for a speedy answer.

591
01:01:20,580 --> 01:01:21,819
Heil Hitler, et cetera.

592
01:02:49,699 --> 01:02:50,898
Sweaty.

593
01:03:12,980 --> 01:03:16,018
The little snow white bird flew down and sang,

594
01:03:17,860 --> 01:03:20,739
"Be warned, be warned."

595
01:03:25,619 --> 01:03:31,378
Gretel understood what the witch had in mind

596
01:03:32,860 --> 01:03:35,378
and said, "Please show me first,

597
01:03:35,380 --> 01:03:37,458
I don't know how to do that."

598
01:03:39,779 --> 01:03:42,458
The witch sat on the shovel

599
01:03:42,900 --> 01:03:44,739
and Gretel pushed her into the oven,

600
01:03:44,739 --> 01:03:48,018
as deep as she could.

601
01:03:49,940 --> 01:03:55,378
Then she closed the iron door of the oven.

602
01:03:55,940 --> 01:03:57,339
And secured it with a bar.

603
01:03:57,819 --> 01:04:01,018
The witch got cooked alive

604
01:04:02,020 --> 01:04:05,739
as a punishment for her horrible deeds.

605
01:04:07,420 --> 01:04:09,259
Gretel ran straight to Hansel,

606
01:04:11,060 --> 01:04:14,458
unlocked the goose cage and let him out.

607
01:04:15,940 --> 01:04:17,259
He jumped out

608
01:04:17,259 --> 01:04:19,458
and threw his arms around his sister's neck.

609
01:04:20,819 --> 01:04:22,018
They kissed one another,

610
01:04:22,020 --> 01:04:24,219
cried with joy, and thanked God.

611
01:04:25,420 --> 01:04:27,058
The little white bird sang,

612
01:04:27,580 --> 01:04:31,819
"Pearls and gems for bread crumbs."

613
01:07:33,779 --> 01:07:35,699
(Polish)
Here you are at last.

01:08:29,499 --> 01:08:31,459
Sunbeams{\i0}

radiant and warm{\i0}

619
01:08:48,060 --> 01:08:50,779
Human bodies{\i0}

620
01:08:54,419 --> 01:08:56,539
Young and old{\i0}

621
01:09:00,820 --> 01:09:04,820
And we{\i0}

622
01:09:06,860 --> 01:09:10,338
who are imprisoned here{\i0}

623
01:09:13,620 --> 01:09:16,058
Our hearts

624
01:09:16,060 --> 01:09:19,298
are not yet cold

625
01:09:23,339 --> 01:09:27,018
Souls afire

626
01:09:29,700 --> 01:09:36,044
the blazing sun

627
01:09:36,820 --> 01:09:40,058
Tearing, breaking

628
01:09:40,060 --> 01:09:44,910
through their pain

629
01:09:46,219 --> 01:09:51,472
For soon we'll see

630
01:09:52,379 --> 01:09:57,714
that wawing flag

631
01:09:59,179 --> 01:10:04,235
The flag of freedom

632
01:10:04,259 --> 01:10:09,259
yet to come

633
01:10:23,579 --> 01:10:25,018
Don't forget to stand straight.

634
01:10:31,840 --> 01:10:34,058
I've packed butter bread for you all.

635
01:10:37,499 --> 01:10:38,779
Come on children. Hurry.

636
01:10:55,060 --> 01:10:55,898
Sophie.

637
01:11:07,020 --> 01:11:09,579
Tell her it's getting cold.

638
01:11:09,579 --> 01:11:10,619
She's not here.

639
01:11:10,980 --> 01:11:11,739
What?

640
01:11:12,579 --> 01:11:13,338
She's gone.

641
01:11:14,100 --> 01:11:15,298
What, not upstairs?

642
01:11:15,660 --> 01:11:16,739
No, she's gone.

643
01:11:17,139 --> 01:11:18,379
And her case has gone.

644
01:11:19,379 --> 01:11:20,739
That cannot be.

645
01:11:23,499 --> 01:11:24,499
Mum?

646
01:11:35,860 --> 01:11:37,379
Go and look for her.

647
01:12:36,539 --> 01:12:37,379
Aniela.

648
01:12:38,379 --> 01:12:39,379
Take it away.

649
01:12:41,179 --> 01:12:43,338
Was that here to spite me?

650
01:12:45,940 --> 01:12:47,459
No, Mrs. Höss.

651
01:13:00,379 --> 01:13:02,779
I could have my husband spread your ashes

652
01:13:02,780 --> 01:13:04,938
across the fields of Babice.

653
01:13:31,060 --> 01:13:33,018
Relax, let her find it.

654
01:13:37,299 --> 01:13:39,299
Are you not going to be a commandant anymore?

655
01:13:41,139 --> 01:13:42,739
I'll be head of all commandants.

656
01:13:45,020 --> 01:13:48,898
Inspecting their camps, seeing
where improvements can be made.

657
01:13:50,339 --> 01:13:52,938
Their yield, that kind of thing.

658
01:13:56,820 --> 01:13:58,898
It has a great name.

659
01:13:59,459 --> 01:14:02,298
It's girl's eye, or tickseed.

660
01:14:02,299 --> 01:14:03,178
Girl's eye?

661
01:14:03,179 --> 01:14:05,739
Girl's eye, yes.

662
01:14:05,740 --> 01:14:07,419
I can only guess

663
01:14:07,419 --> 01:14:11,058
that's because of its serrated petals,

664
01:14:11,060 --> 01:14:15,018
because they resemble the long eyelashes

665
01:14:15,020 --> 01:14:19,379
of women and girls.

666
01:16:07,620 --> 01:16:08,419
You there.

667
01:16:09,219 --> 01:16:10,058
Guard.

668
01:16:15,339 --> 01:16:16,258
Bring him here.

669
01:16:23,379 --> 01:16:24,419
What's he done?

670
01:16:24,820 --> 01:16:27,459
Fighting over an apple, Commandant.

671
01:16:28,139 --> 01:16:29,419
Drown him in the river.

672
01:16:30,740 --> 01:16:31,298
Come.

673
01:16:44,060 --> 01:16:46,218
Don't do that again.

674
01:16:51,139 --> 01:16:52,218
Move it.

675
01:16:53,980 --> 01:16:54,938
I don't care.

676
01:16:54,940 --> 01:16:55,859
Move it.

677
01:16:55,860 --> 01:16:56,938
Get it out.

678
01:17:06,499 --> 01:17:09,499
Are you going to stand there trembling?

679
01:17:10,660 --> 01:17:11,819
Something to say?

680
01:17:16,539 --> 01:17:17,419
Come.

681
01:17:55,820 --> 01:17:58,218
Aren't you lovely?

682
01:17:58,219 --> 01:18:00,499
Yes, you are lovely.

683
01:18:00,940 --> 01:18:01,938
Male or female?

684
01:18:01,940 --> 01:18:02,659
Male.

685
01:18:02,660 --> 01:18:03,619
How old?

686
01:18:03,620 --> 01:18:04,338
4 years old.

687
01:18:04,740 --> 01:18:05,619
What's his name?

688
01:18:05,620 --> 01:18:06,218
Torin.

689
01:18:08,980 --> 01:18:11,258
You don't see many with his colouring...

690
01:18:11,740 --> 01:18:13,379
No, mostly black or salt and pepper.

691
01:18:14,860 --> 01:18:18,018
I had a black one when I was little. Elsa.

692
01:18:18,020 --> 01:18:19,338
Born on the same day I was.

693
01:18:19,980 --> 01:18:20,819
He's lovely.

694
01:18:20,820 --> 01:18:21,419
Thank you.

695
01:18:22,179 --> 01:18:22,978
Come on.

696
01:18:23,980 --> 01:18:27,018
On Sunday at 19h there
will be a benefit concert

697
01:18:27,020 --> 01:18:30,058
at the Marksmen’s Club to raise
money for War Winter Relief.

698
01:18:30,459 --> 01:18:32,138
Junior Squad Leader Johann Thissen

699
01:18:32,139 --> 01:18:34,258
will conduct the orchestra in
a two part programme

700
01:18:34,259 --> 01:18:36,259
featuring a tribute to Herms Niel...

Herbert, Warsaw.

723
01:19:06,940 --> 01:19:08,459
Apologies for absence,

724
01:19:08,459 --> 01:19:10,419
Foérschner, Mittelbau-Dora.

725
01:19:10,419 --> 01:19:12,619
Sauer, Riga-Kaiserwald.

726
01:19:14,419 --> 01:19:16,218
The Führer has approved the deportation

727
01:19:16,219 --> 01:19:18,659
of Hungary's 700,000 Jews for extermination

728
01:19:19,259 --> 01:19:21,659
and war production where able-bodied.

729
01:19:23,020 --> 01:19:24,579
An agreement was reached

730
01:19:24,579 --> 01:19:26,178
with the new Hungarian government

731
01:19:26,179 --> 01:19:28,699
to begin the operation immediately.

732
01:19:29,379 --> 01:19:30,499
They are being amassed

733
01:19:30,499 --> 01:19:32,739
for transportation to Auschwitz.

734
01:19:32,740 --> 01:19:35,058
4 trains a day, 3,000 on each.

735
01:19:35,060 --> 01:19:36,779
12,000 daily.

736
01:19:37,060 --> 01:19:39,258
Firstly via the Eastern zones, 1 to 3.

737
01:19:39,740 --> 01:19:40,898
Then via 4 and 5

738
01:19:40,900 --> 01:19:42,779
in the middle of the country,

739
01:19:42,780 --> 01:19:44,018
and finally, Budapest.

740
01:19:45,579 --> 01:19:47,459
Pressburg and Vienna are heavily loaded

741
01:19:47,459 --> 01:19:49,058
with military transports.

742
01:19:49,060 --> 01:19:51,298
Jewish transports will pass through

743
01:19:51,299 --> 01:19:53,298
Kassa and Muszyna instead.

744
01:19:54,259 --> 01:19:57,098
Based on estimates provided
by Obersturmbannfiihrer Hiss,

745
01:19:57,100 --> 01:20:00,298
25% will be retained for
labour after selection.

746
01:20:00,299 --> 01:20:02,218
20% of those will be utilized

747
01:20:02,219 --> 01:20:04,379
in Auschwitz sub-camps,

748
01:20:04,379 --> 01:20:06,178
and the other 80%

749
01:20:06,179 --> 01:20:08,579
will come to your camps in due course.

750
01:20:10,020 --> 01:20:12,579
The scale is many times larger than before.

751
01:20:12,579 --> 01:20:14,218
So prepare yourselves.

752
01:20:14,700 --> 01:20:17,178
Before I hand over to
Obersturmbannfiihrer Höss,

753
01:20:18,179 --> 01:20:19,338
I'd like to announce

754
01:20:19,339 --> 01:20:20,699
the promotion of Colonel Maurer

755
01:20:20,700 --> 01:20:22,298
to the rank of SS-Standartenfiihrer

756
01:20:22,700 --> 01:20:25,579
for consistently hitting his labour targets.

757
01:20:25,579 --> 01:20:26,379
Bravo.

758
01:20:28,100 --> 01:20:31,978
I get fan mail from CEOs for this man.

759
01:20:32,419 --> 01:20:33,419
More famous than me.

760
01:20:33,419 --> 01:20:34,258
Thank you, sir.

761
01:20:34,940 --> 01:20:35,739
Well deserved.

762
01:20:35,740 --> 01:20:36,819
As I've said before,

763
01:20:36,820 --> 01:20:38,619
I'm grateful for your leadership.

764
01:20:38,860 --> 01:20:41,619
Thank you. You have said that.
I appreciate that.

765
01:20:41,919 --> 01:20:43,638
Thank you, Obergruppenführer Pohl.

766
01:20:43,639 --> 01:20:44,619
Good morning, everyone.

767
01:20:44,620 --> 01:20:45,579
Good morning.

768
01:20:45,579 --> 01:20:47,659
Two apologies for absence.

769
01:20:47,660 --> 01:20:50,018
Sturmbannführer Férschner, Mittelbau-Dora.

770
01:20:50,020 --> 01:20:52,459
Sturmbannführer Sauer, Riga-Kaiserwald.

771
01:20:53,219 --> 01:20:54,779
You will appreciate

772
01:20:54,780 --> 01:20:56,779
we have a very busy agenda today.

773
01:20:57,459 --> 01:20:59,859
The Hungarian operation is urgent,

774
01:20:59,860 --> 01:21:01,218
and complex,

775
01:21:01,219 --> 01:21:03,499
and will involve converging challenges

776
01:21:03,499 --> 01:21:05,898
at every operational level.

777
01:21:07,259 --> 01:21:09,338
Please turn to the first page in your files.

778
01:21:10,980 --> 01:21:12,619
You will see five headings.

779
01:21:13,299 --> 01:21:14,178
Item one.

780
01:21:14,179 --> 01:21:15,419
Timings.

781
01:21:15,419 --> 01:21:16,539
Item two.

782
01:21:16,539 --> 01:21:18,659

Item three.

784
01:21:19,459 --> 01:21:20,379
Transportation.

785
01:21:21,060 --> 01:21:23,058
For item four, prisoner workers.

786
01:21:23,060 --> 01:21:25,978
Dr. Meindi from Steyr-Daimler-Puch,

787
01:21:25,980 --> 01:21:28,098
some of you know him, some of you don't,

788
01:21:28,860 --> 01:21:30,258
is joining us today

789
01:21:30,259 --> 01:21:33,058
to discuss pay rates and incentives.

790
01:21:33,780 --> 01:21:34,898
Item five.

791
01:21:34,900 --> 01:21:36,859
And air defence measures.

792
01:22:40,139 --> 01:22:42,258
The girls didn't want to go out.

793
01:22:42,259 --> 01:22:42,938
Yes.

794
01:22:45,020 --> 01:22:46,459
Because it is so cold.

795
01:22:46,740 --> 01:22:49,779
Well, I love the snow.

796
01:23:02,900 --> 01:23:04,218
Stop.

797
01:23:04,660 --> 01:23:07,138
Leave me alone, Claus.

798
01:23:16,299 --> 01:23:19,579
Stop it, Claus.

799
01:23:22,259 --> 01:23:24,859
No.

800
01:23:27,620 --> 01:23:29,178
Leave me alone, you traitor.

801
01:23:40,459 --> 01:23:43,218
Saturday's funeral ceremony for the pupils

802
01:23:43,219 --> 01:23:44,659
of the Air Force School

803
01:23:44,860 --> 01:23:46,459
who died in the bombing raid

804
01:23:46,459 --> 01:23:48,258
of March 6th will start at 11:30.

805
01:23:48,780 --> 01:23:51,058
SS pall bearers should congregate

806
01:23:51,060 --> 01:23:54,499
in the forecourt of the T Building by 10:45.

807
01:23:55,219 --> 01:23:57,218
Transport will leave for Hans Schemm School

808
01:23:57,219 --> 01:23:58,539
promptly at 11am.

809
01:23:59,339 --> 01:24:01,178
Commander of the Guard

810
01:24:02,020 --> 01:24:04,218
Obersturmbannführer Gustav Wegner

811
01:24:04,980 --> 01:24:07,098
will lead the cortege to the cemetery

812
01:24:07,900 --> 01:24:10,539
with a delegation from the
League of German Girls

813
01:24:11,139 --> 01:24:12,938
and Air Force Students.

814
01:24:19,020 --> 01:24:20,419
Obersturmbannfiihrer Höss.

815
01:24:23,379 --> 01:24:24,699
Rudolf. Come on in.

816
01:24:25,339 --> 01:24:26,098
How are you?

817
01:24:26,660 --> 01:24:27,338
Good.

818
01:24:28,299 --> 01:24:30,539
I've just received this.

819
01:24:31,419 --> 01:24:32,779
Obergruppenführer Poht met with

820
01:24:32,780 --> 01:24:34,218
Reichsführer Himmler

821
01:24:34,219 --> 01:24:36,619
to assess the numbers involved

822
01:24:38,940 --> 01:24:40,459
and your name came up.

823
01:24:51,620 --> 01:24:53,739
We're moving Liebehenschel to Majdanek.

824
01:24:54,419 --> 01:24:56,539
He's not energetic enough for this.

825
01:24:56,539 --> 01:24:57,379
Okay.

826
01:24:57,379 --> 01:25:00,058
You'll receive operational
orders from Eichmann.

827
01:25:00,459 --> 01:25:01,218
Perfect.

828
01:25:01,539 --> 01:25:04,138
Tell me what resources you
need when you get there.

829
01:25:04,139 --> 01:25:05,018
I will.

830
01:25:05,020 --> 01:25:09,659
Any problems, come to me or Gerhard directly.

831
01:25:13,139 --> 01:25:13,779
Thank you.

832
01:25:14,539 --> 01:25:15,898
How's Hedwig?

833
01:25:15,900 --> 01:25:16,938
Good.

834
01:25:16,940 --> 01:25:19,218
Pohl told me she sends the boss

835
01:25:19,219 --> 01:25:21,138
flowers from your garden every week.

836
01:25:21,139 --> 01:25:21,739
Yes.

837
01:25:23,459 --> 01:25:24,338
Get the job done.

838
01:25:24,940 --> 01:25:25,859
I will. Thank you.

839
01:25:26,280 --> 01:25:27,779
I appreciate the trust and confidence

840
01:25:27,780 --> 01:25:28,579
you have in me.

841
01:25:40,039 --> 01:25:41,018
And?

842
01:25:43,539 --> 01:25:44,699
I'm not sure yet.

843
01:25:46,020 --> 01:25:47,178
Relax.

844
01:25:48,139 --> 01:25:50,218
He won't put them all up the chimney.

845
01:25:52,179 --> 01:25:54,018
You'll get your workers.

846
01:25:54,820 --> 01:25:55,978
You'll see.

847
01:26:08,900 --> 01:26:10,218
Are you sleeping, okay?

848
01:26:10,219 --> 01:26:10,859
Yes.

849
01:26:13,579 --> 01:26:15,619
How many bowel movements
do you have per day?

850
01:26:16,339 --> 01:26:17,419
Twice per day.

851
01:26:18,499 --> 01:26:19,499
Urinating?

852
01:26:20,179 --> 01:26:21,379
Without issues.

853
01:26:23,139 --> 01:26:26,419
I'll feel around now. On the surface, first.

854
01:26:26,419 --> 01:26:30,058
If there is any pain, then please let me know.

855
01:26:43,639 --> 01:26:44,438
This is Höss.

856
01:26:44,440 --> 01:26:45,579
Long-distance priority call,

857
01:26:45,579 --> 01:26:47,779
KL Auschwitz, Höss private residence.

858
01:26:48,379 --> 01:26:49,298
I'll stay on the line.

859
01:27:05,100 --> 01:27:06,058
Are you there?

860
01:27:07,100 --> 01:27:07,779
Hello?

861
01:27:07,780 --> 01:27:08,859
Can you talk?

862
01:27:10,740 --> 01:27:11,938
Is everything okay?

863
01:27:11,940 --> 01:27:12,579
Yes.

864
01:27:12,579 --> 01:27:13,699
I have news.

865
01:27:13,700 --> 01:27:15,419
I told you I'd heard rumblings

866
01:27:15,419 --> 01:27:16,619
but nothing concrete.

867
01:27:17,700 --> 01:27:19,138
What news?

868
01:27:19,139 --> 01:27:20,218
The Hungary thing.

869
01:27:20,620 --> 01:27:22,579
The old man gave me orders from Heinrich.

870
01:27:23,139 --> 01:27:25,499
It's happening at last.
I'm coming back to run it.

871
01:27:25,820 --> 01:27:28,058
Well, I'm very relieved about that.

872
01:27:32,579 --> 01:27:34,419
I have to admit, I'm pleased as Punch.

873
01:27:37,379 --> 01:27:37,898
Yes.

874
01:27:40,360 --> 01:27:42,478
I don't know, I go to Budapest first.

875
01:27:42,480 --> 01:27:44,039
Things will be clearer after that.

876
01:27:44,039 --> 01:27:46,138
Anyway, my cogs are turning.

877
01:27:46,139 --> 01:27:47,258
I must get on.

878
01:27:47,700 --> 01:27:48,898
I'll call you re party.

879
01:27:48,900 --> 01:27:50,459
No. Wait, please

880
01:27:50,459 --> 01:27:51,859
Tell Eleanor Pohl,

881
01:27:52,579 --> 01:27:54,258
when she receives her parcel,

882
01:27:54,259 --> 01:27:55,659
to look in the compact.

883
01:27:55,660 --> 01:27:56,619
They're inside.

884
01:31:17,419 --> 01:31:19,898
I heard Himmler's calling it Operation Höss.

885
01:31:20,179 --> 01:31:22,138
That's fantastic. I'm so happy for you.

886
01:31:22,660 --> 01:31:23,499
Thank you, Mutzi.

887
01:31:23,780 --> 01:31:24,898
It's your name too.

888
01:31:25,740 --> 01:31:26,859
Who was there?

889
01:31:27,660 --> 01:31:28,659
To tell you the truth

890
01:31:29,179 --> 01:31:31,298
I wasn't really paying attention.

891
01:31:32,020 --> 01:31:33,258
I was too busy thinking

892
01:31:33,259 --> 01:31:35,298
how I'd gas everyone in the room.

893
01:31:35,780 --> 01:31:37,859
Very difficult, logistically,

894
01:31:38,139 --> 01:31:39,539
because of its high ceiling.

895
01:31:42,100 --> 01:31:44,218
It's the middle of the night

896
01:31:44,219 --> 01:31:46,659
and I need to be in bed.

897
01:31:47,780 --> 01:31:49,098
I shouldn't have called so late.

898
01:31:50,020 --> 01:31:51,659
I was just excited to tell you the name.

899
01:31:52,860 --> 01:31:55,699
You can tell me about it when you get back.

900
01:32:03,539 --> 01:32:05,539
You have told them Daddy's coming home?

901
01:32:07,339 --> 01:32:08,058
Yes.

902
01:32:08,539 --> 01:32:09,419
Goodnight.

903
01:38:59,100 --> 01:39:04,100
