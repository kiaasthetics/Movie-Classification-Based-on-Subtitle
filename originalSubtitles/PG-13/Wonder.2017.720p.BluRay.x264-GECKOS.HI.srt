Yeah. Tide.

00:06:53,112 --> 00:06:54,111
MR. TUSHMAN:
Why don't you guys

102
00:06:54,113 --> 00:06:55,613
take Auggie 'round
the school a bit, huh?

103
00:06:55,615 --> 00:06:58,485
Just be back here in, uh,
a half hour?

104
00:07:11,430 --> 00:07:13,063
CHARLOTTE: <i>I started
when I was two.</i>

105
00:07:13,065 --> 00:07:14,432
Local spots mostly.

106
00:07:14,434 --> 00:07:17,534
Then when I was three I booked
my first national. NestlÃ© Quik.

107
00:07:17,536 --> 00:07:20,070
It was hard, because
I'm lactose intolerant.

108
00:07:20,072 --> 00:07:22,372
Anyway, have you ever heard
of a spit bucket?

109
00:07:22,374 --> 00:07:25,646
So this is our homeroom.
We have Mr. Browne.

110
00:07:27,012 --> 00:07:29,279
My mom says
he's a little weird.

111
00:07:29,281 --> 00:07:31,382

Then I was in the chorus of

112
00:07:31,384 --> 00:07:35,586

Christmas Spectacular.

113
00:07:35,588 --> 00:07:37,654
I auditioned
for Annie on Broadway.

114
00:07:37,656 --> 00:07:41,425
I got two callbacks for Molly, but I guess
they went in a different direction.

115
00:07:41,427 --> 00:07:42,495
Hey, Charlotte!

116
00:07:43,530 --> 00:07:45,332

117
00:07:46,266 --> 00:07:48,733
So this is the cafeteria.

118
00:07:48,735 --> 00:07:52,202
The food here is okay
for school food.

119
00:07:52,204 --> 00:07:55,541
Or do you eat special food?

120
00:08:06,019 --> 00:08:11,221
Wow! This reminds me of my
guess spot on <i>Law & Order.</i>

121
00:08:11,223 --> 00:08:14,425
So the science elective
is supposably really hard.

122
00:08:14,427 --> 00:08:16,526
So you probably won't be
spending much time here.

123
00:08:16,528 --> 00:08:19,497
No offense, but if you've never
been in a real school before...

124
00:08:19,499 --> 00:08:21,432
Dude, he's been home schooled.

125
00:08:21,434 --> 00:08:23,233
Okay, I'm just saying.

really hard.

127
00:08:25,637 --> 00:08:27,771
But you're taking it,
too, right?

128
00:08:27,773 --> 00:08:30,707
(CHUCKLES) Hey,
maybe you could fail together.

129
00:08:30,709 --> 00:08:33,346
Why don't you get out of the
way, so he can check it out?

130
00:08:34,747 --> 00:08:35,949
Okay.

131
00:08:37,717 --> 00:08:41,351
I mean, there's nothing much
to see. Desks. Chairs.

132
00:08:41,353 --> 00:08:43,388
The incubator. Bunsen burners.

133
00:08:43,390 --> 00:08:45,592
Those are some
really gross science posters.

134
00:08:46,559 --> 00:08:49,394
Oh! And this is an eraser.

135
00:08:49,396 --> 00:08:51,328
CHARLOTTE: He knows
what an eraser is.

136
00:08:51,330 --> 00:08:53,096
How am I supposed to know
what he knows?

137
00:08:53,098 --> 00:08:54,332
He doesn't say anything.

138
00:08:54,334 --> 00:08:56,337
You know
what an eraser is, right?

139
00:08:57,670 --> 00:09:00,507
(WHISPERS) Dude,
you have to say something.

140
00:09:02,074 --> 00:09:03,743
Yeah, I know
what an eraser is.

141
00:09:06,246 --> 00:09:10,414
Is... Is your name Jack
or Jackwill?

142
00:09:10,416 --> 00:09:12,616
(GIGGLES) You thought his name
was Jackwill?

143
00:09:12,618 --> 00:09:16,189
Yeah, a lotta people call me
by my first and last name.

144
00:09:16,723 --> 00:09:18,456
I don't know why.

145
00:09:18,458 --> 00:09:19,689
Got any other questions?

146
00:09:19,691 --> 00:09:23,226
Actually, I've got
a question for Auggie.

147
00:09:23,228 --> 00:09:24,495
What's the deal
with your face?

148
00:09:24,497 --> 00:09:25,495
Dude!

149
00:09:25,497 --> 00:09:27,097
I mean were you
in a car crash or something?

150
00:09:27,099 --> 00:09:28,332
Julian!

151
00:09:28,334 --> 00:09:30,735
What? Tushman said we could
ask questions if we wanted to.

152
00:09:30,737 --> 00:09:31,735
Not rude questions.

153
00:09:31,737 --> 00:09:34,471
Besides, he was born
like that, Mr. Tushman said.

154
00:09:34,473 --> 00:09:38,241
Yeah, I know. I just thought maybe
he was, like, in a fire, too.

155
00:09:38,243 --> 00:09:40,110
Hey, Julian, shut up.

156
00:09:40,112 --> 00:09:41,178
You shut up!

157
00:09:41,180 --> 00:09:42,248
Why don't we all shut up?

158
00:09:43,650 --> 00:09:45,519
No, I wasn't in a fire.

159
00:09:48,454 --> 00:09:50,189
And the word's "supposedly."

160
00:09:52,191 --> 00:09:53,490
What?

161
00:09:53,492 --> 00:09:57,562
You said that science
is supposably really hard.

162
00:09:57,564 --> 00:09:59,596
Twice.

163
00:09:59,598 --> 00:10:02,468
The word's "supposedly."
With a "D."

164
00:10:05,170 --> 00:10:07,407
Maybe my mom
can home school you, too.

165
00:10:21,253 --> 00:10:24,856
Do you wanna tell us yet
how you felt about the tour?

166
00:10:24,858 --> 00:10:26,157
Today?

167
00:10:26,159 --> 00:10:27,725
Mr. Tushman
went out of his way

168
00:10:27,727 --> 00:10:29,527
to tell me how sweet
those kids were

169
00:10:29,529 --> 00:10:32,665
and that Julian
is apparently quite the dream.

170
00:10:33,599 --> 00:10:35,165
(SIGHS) No.

171
00:10:35,167 --> 00:10:36,402

345

Auggie, you're supposed
to knock.

346
00:21:07,532 --> 00:21:09,234
I'm serious this time.

347
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:16,242

make fun of it?

348

Right, Daisy?
Right. Good girl.

351
00:21:45,436 --> 00:21:50,106
Well I went to, um,
Kinko's today

352
00:21:50,108 --> 00:21:53,577
to see if they could
get my thesis off this.

353

00:22:51,002 --> 00:22:52,004
Good.

371
00:22:53,105 --> 00:22:55,338
Good how?
Good like it was good?

372

Or good like it was bad and
you just don't wanna tell us?

373

It was good, okay?
I just don't know

374

It was good!

it was my idea, too.

it doesn't count?

Hi. I'm Summer.

866
00:54:37,775 --> 00:54:40,509
I know.
We're in the same homeroom.

You don't have to be
my friend.

talking about, Auggie.

and told them they had to be
friends with me.

874

No, he didn't,
I swear on my life!

00:55:02,866 --> 00:55:06,201
AUGGIE: Okay, okay.
You don't have to get mad.

880
00:55:06,203 --> 00:55:08,969
I don't like being
accused of things, okay?

881
00:55:08,971 --> 00:55:10,371
Okay. I'm sorry.

882
00:55:10,373 --> 00:55:11,742
You should be.

- Auggie!

Okay, I just...
Why are you sitting here then?

885
00:55:21,018 --> 00:55:23,121
Because I want some
nice friends for a change.

886
00:55:23,987 --> 00:55:25,320

give us an excuse to hang out more.

avoiding him forever, Auggie.

1045
01:06:07,831 --> 01:06:10,498
Christmas was awesome.
We drove up into the mountains

1046
01:06:10,500 --> 01:06:13,000
where they had the most
amazing snow I've ever seen.

1047
01:06:13,002 --> 01:06:14,802
- It was like powder.
- Nice.

1049
01:06:15,938 --> 01:06:18,972
I went up Skeleton Hill.
It was the best.

1051
01:06:20,076 --> 01:06:21,208
I hate that place!

1052
01:06:21,210 --> 01:06:22,744
Should be called Garbage Hill.

1053
01:06:22,746 --> 01:06:26,813
I know, right? I left my old lightning
sled up there last time I was up.

1054
01:06:26,815 --> 01:06:29,016
It was the crappiest
piece o' junk.

1055
01:06:29,018 --> 01:06:31,251
Went back the next day
and someone had taken it.

these words inscribed

1062
01:06:42,998 --> 01:06:44,867

what they mean?

Oh, uh...

1065
01:06:52,275 --> 01:06:54,641

that the things we do

1066
01:06:54,643 --> 01:06:56,576

that matter most.

Anybody else?

Hey, Summer.

01:07:05,054 --> 01:07:06,757
Hey. You okay?

1070
01:07:07,523 --> 01:07:09,893
Yeah. Fine. Just...

sound stupid, but...

do you know why
Auggie stopped liking me?

1073
01:07:17,599 --> 01:07:19,534
You should ask him.

1074
01:07:19,536 --> 01:07:24,539
I have, but ever since Halloween,
he just won't talk to me.

1075
01:07:24,541 --> 01:07:28,175

I don't care. Sorry.

about anything.

No.

I know we're supposed to be
in pairs,

1096
01:08:31,007 --> 01:08:33,774
but Jack, Amos and I had
this science fair project idea

1097
01:08:33,776 --> 01:08:35,242
that we wanted
to work on together.

No, um, it's okay.
I'll stay with who I've got.

1103

very seriously at this school.

1371
01:27:37,218 --> 01:27:38,753
There is zero tolerance.

1372
01:27:40,288 --> 01:27:44,457
Excuse me, can you explain
what's going on here?

1373
01:27:44,459 --> 01:27:46,859
Wasn't Julian the one
who got punched in the mouth?

1374
01:27:46,861 --> 01:27:49,297
If there's any bullying
going on, it isn't my son.

Yes, sir.

1377
01:28:04,012 --> 01:28:07,249
That one note was on the back
of a class photo.

1378
01:28:08,816 --> 01:28:11,052
Your son photoshopped
Auggie out of it.

1379
01:28:14,489 --> 01:28:19,225
No. No, he didn't. I did.

1380
01:28:19,227 --> 01:28:21,860
Of course, I didn't think that
he would bring it to school.

1381
01:28:21,862 --> 01:28:23,529
But when our friends come over
and they see that picture,

1382
01:28:23,531 --> 01:28:25,030
I want them
to ask about our son.

1383
01:28:25,032 --> 01:28:27,100
Not the Pullmans'.

MR. TUSHMAN: Mrs. Albans.

1385
01:28:29,504 --> 01:28:34,573
When we pressed Auggie,
he showed us these other notes

1386
01:28:34,575 --> 01:28:38,747
that your son left
in his locker and his desk.

Okay, look,
if no one else is gonna

1389
01:28:49,156 --> 01:28:52,391
have the courage to say it,
then I guess I will.

1390
01:28:52,393 --> 01:28:55,228
These kids are too young to be
dealing with this sort of thing.

1391
01:28:55,230 --> 01:28:57,229
Julian has had nightmares
because of that kid.

1392
01:28:57,231 --> 01:28:58,597
- Did you know that?
- Sarah.

1393
01:28:58,599 --> 01:29:00,966
We had to take him
to a child psychologist

1394
01:29:00,968 --> 01:29:02,502
to help him deal
with his night terrors.

1395
01:29:02,504 --> 01:29:04,306
It's just
a two-day suspension.

from a kid?

1399

have poured into this school?

can't change the way he looks.

1408

So, maybe we can change
the way we see.

01:38:34,909 --> 01:38:36,708
NATE: That's terrible.
I'm sorry.

1541
01:38:36,710 --> 01:38:38,978
- Did you win?
- Nate!

1542
01:38:38,980 --> 01:38:41,750
Well, I'm getting a vibe
like maybe he won.

1543
01:38:42,650 --> 01:38:43,716
Did you?

1544
01:38:43,718 --> 01:38:47,185
Yeah. And guess what?
They were seventh graders.

1545
01:38:47,187 --> 01:38:49,188
- (EXCLAIMS)
- Yes!

1546
01:38:49,190 --> 01:38:50,722
MILES: See you later, buddy!

1547
01:38:50,724 --> 01:38:51,727
Bye!

1548
01:38:53,561 --> 01:38:55,194
NATE: Fighting is bad, Auggie.

1549
01:38:55,196 --> 01:38:57,729
- Bye, Mr. and Mrs. P.
- NATE: Goodbye.

1550
01:38:57,731 --> 01:38:59,567
See you at graduation, Auggie.

1551
01:39:03,670 --> 01:39:06,070
Looking sharp.

1552
01:39:06,072 --> 01:39:07,206
Thanks, Dad.

1553
01:39:07,208 --> 01:39:08,740
I'm talking about me.

1554
01:39:08,742 --> 01:39:11,976
Hey! Ah, you look good, too.

1555
01:39:11,978 --> 01:39:16,717
I think it's safe to say the
Pullman men are crushing it today.

1556
01:39:19,821 --> 01:39:22,758
- You've come a long way, huh?
- Yeah.

1557
01:39:25,860 --> 01:39:29,528
Auggie, I am proud of you
for sticking it out.

1558
01:39:29,530 --> 01:39:31,063
You didn't think I would,
did you?

1559
01:39:31,065 --> 01:39:32,467
'Course I did.

1560
01:39:35,469 --> 01:39:36,502
Okay, well, come on.

1561
01:39:36,504 --> 01:39:38,970
I mean, when you started
you were still wearing

1562
01:39:38,972 --> 01:39:41,539
the astronaut helmet
in public.

1563
01:39:41,541 --> 01:39:44,780
I love that helmet.
I wish I knew where it was.

1564
01:39:48,215 --> 01:39:49,948
It's in my office.

1565
01:39:49,950 --> 01:39:53,752
What? Dad! That was a gift.
You had no right to hide it!

1566
01:39:53,754 --> 01:39:55,653
Auggie, Auggie,
please, don't be mad.

1567
01:39:55,655 --> 01:39:59,058
You gotta understand, you
were wearing it all the time.

1568
01:39:59,060 --> 01:40:00,859
I never got
to see you anymore.

1569
01:40:00,861 --> 01:40:03,095
I missed your face.

1570
01:40:03,097 --> 01:40:05,898
I know you don't always
like it, but I love it.

1571
01:40:05,900 --> 01:40:07,936
It's my son's face.

1572
01:40:10,937 --> 01:40:12,673
I wanna see it.

1573
01:40:15,642 --> 01:40:16,942
Do you forgive me?

1574
01:40:16,944 --> 01:40:17,946
No.

1575
01:40:20,947 --> 01:40:21,950
Yes.

1576
01:40:24,218 --> 01:40:25,618
Does Mom know?

1577
01:40:25,620 --> 01:40:28,520
(WHISPERS) No.
God, no, she'd kill me.

1578
01:40:28,522 --> 01:40:31,789
But I can maybe find it,
if you need it back.

1579
01:40:31,791 --> 01:40:33,061
That's okay.

1580
01:40:43,803 --> 01:40:45,639
(CHOIR SINGING)

1581
01:40:59,853 --> 01:41:01,854
- (WHISPERS) Mom.
- (WHISPERS) Yes?

1582
01:41:01,856 --> 01:41:02,991
Thank you.

1583
01:41:04,724 --> 01:41:05,823
For what?

1584
01:41:05,825 --> 01:41:07,628
Making me go to school.

1585
01:41:10,897 --> 01:41:13,097
I was so mad at you sometimes.

1586
01:41:13,099 --> 01:41:15,136
But I'm really happy
to be here.

1587
01:41:17,271 --> 01:41:19,773
You really are a wonder,
Auggie.

1588
01:41:21,041 --> 01:41:22,710
You are a wonder.

1589
01:41:27,748 --> 01:41:29,718
(CHOIR CONTINUES SINGING)

1590
01:41:43,263 --> 01:41:45,363
Whoo. (CHUCKLES)

1591
01:41:45,365 --> 01:41:49,169
Thank you, choir.
That was beautiful.

1592
01:41:50,737 --> 01:41:56,578
Ladies, gentlemen,
boys and girls, graduates.

1593
01:41:58,044 --> 01:42:03,215
Final award this morning is
the Henry Ward Beecher medal

1594
01:42:03,217 --> 01:42:08,988
to honor students who have
been notable or exemplary.

1595
01:42:08,990 --> 01:42:14,993
Usually, it's a "good works,"
a service award.

1596
01:42:14,995 --> 01:42:18,329
But I came upon a passage
that he wrote,

1597
01:42:18,331 --> 01:42:24,739
which made me realize that
good works come in many forms.

1598
01:42:26,374 --> 01:42:32,112
"Greatness," he wrote,
"lies not in being strong

1599
01:42:33,147 --> 01:42:37,018
"but in the right using
of strength.

1600
01:42:38,052 --> 01:42:42,421
<i>"He or she is the greatest</i>

1601
01:42:42,423 --> 01:42:46,958
<i>"whose strength carries up
the most hearts</i>

1602
01:42:46,960 --> 01:42:50,164
<i>"by the attraction
of his own."</i>

1603
01:42:53,867 --> 01:43:00,305
Without further ado,
this year, I am very proud

1604
01:43:00,307 --> 01:43:04,943
to award the Henry Ward
Beecher medal

1605
01:43:04,945 --> 01:43:09,681
to the student
whose quiet strength

1606
01:43:09,683 --> 01:43:12,020
has carried up
the most hearts.

1607
01:43:12,953 --> 01:43:14,819
So,

1608
01:43:14,821 --> 01:43:18,756
will August Pullman please come
up here to receive this award?

1609
01:43:18,758 --> 01:43:20,761
(ALL CHEERING AND APPLAUDING)

1610
01:43:25,031 --> 01:43:26,333
Whoo!

1611
01:43:52,992 --> 01:43:55,196
You're the best, dude!

1612
01:43:59,200 --> 01:44:03,836
AUGGIE: <i>Walking up towards that
stage, I felt like I was floating.</i>

1613
01:44:03,838 --> 01:44:06,438
<i>My heart was beating so fast.</i>

1614
01:44:06,440 --> 01:44:09,774
<i>I didn't really understand
why I was getting a medal.</i>

1615
01:44:09,776 --> 01:44:13,145
<i>It's not like I blew up
the Death Star.</i>

1616
01:44:13,147 --> 01:44:17,349
<i>All I did was get through fifth
grade, just like everyone else here.</i>

1617
01:44:17,351 --> 01:44:18,420
Congratulations.

1618
01:44:20,521 --> 01:44:22,954
Here you go. That's for you.

1619
01:44:22,956 --> 01:44:25,360
AUGGIE: <i>Then again, maybe
that's kind of the point.</i>

1620
01:44:27,227 --> 01:44:30,764
<i>Maybe the truth is,
I'm really not so ordinary.</i>

1621
01:44:32,165 --> 01:44:34,966
<i>Maybe if we knew what other
people were thinking</i>

1622
01:44:34,968 --> 01:44:37,435
<i>we'd know that
no one's ordinary.</i>

1623
01:44:37,437 --> 01:44:42,209
<i>And we all deserve a standing
ovation at least once in our lives.</i>

1624
01:44:43,511 --> 01:44:45,045
<i>My friends do.</i>

1625
01:44:49,517 --> 01:44:51,119
<i>My teachers do.</i>

1626
01:44:52,352 --> 01:44:56,188
<i>My sister does
for always being there for me.</i>

1627
01:44:56,190 --> 01:44:59,094
<i>My dad does
for always making us laugh.</i>

1628
01:45:00,194 --> 01:45:02,261
<i>And my mom does the most.</i>

1629
01:45:02,263 --> 01:45:05,197
<i>For never giving up.
On anything.</i>

1630
01:45:05,199 --> 01:45:06,433
<i>Especially, me.</i>

1631
01:45:08,201 --> 01:45:12,337
<i>It's like that last precept
Mr. Browne gave us.</i>

1632
01:45:12,339 --> 01:45:16,809
<i>Be kind, for everyone
is fighting a hard battle.</i>

1633
01:45:16,811 --> 01:45:19,114
<i>And if you really wanna see
what people are,</i>

1634
01:45:20,347 --> 01:45:24,451
<i>all you have to do... is look.</i>
