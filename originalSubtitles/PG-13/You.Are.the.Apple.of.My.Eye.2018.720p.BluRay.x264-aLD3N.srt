1
00:00:22,374 --> 00:00:31,175
"A worthwhile dream
is one that is laughed at".

2
00:00:47,358 --> 00:00:49,318
Hey, hurry up.

3
00:00:49,652 --> 00:00:51,153
The bride is waiting.

4
00:01:06,043 --> 00:01:10,422
Ten years ago,
I was in high school.

5
00:01:11,548 --> 00:01:15,761
Before my mom became
a Korean pop culture fan

6
00:01:16,970 --> 00:01:18,763
and a little after the

7
00:01:18,764 --> 00:01:21,892
Olympic Games in Beijing.

8
00:01:22,226 --> 00:01:26,938
That spring, they started building
the Sky Tree in Tokyo.

9
00:01:26,939 --> 00:01:28,232
Hi, Kosuke.

10
00:01:29,817 --> 00:01:31,610
This is Junon Akiyama.

11
00:01:32,236 --> 00:01:34,737
Unfortunately for him

12
00:01:34,738 --> 00:01:38,325
his mom named him
after a popular teen magazine.

13
00:01:38,450 --> 00:01:41,995
His family owns an inn so
he gets a generous allowance.

14
00:01:43,664 --> 00:01:46,959
This is Kazuki Sugimura,
nicknamed Ikki.

15
00:01:47,292 --> 00:01:49,586
An ever-cheerful
social butterfly.

16
00:01:50,003 --> 00:01:53,340
But his nose bleeds on
the rare occasions that he lies.

17
00:01:53,757 --> 00:01:56,927
It must mean
that his heart is pure.

18
00:01:58,053 --> 00:02:00,681
He lives with his mom,
a piano teacher.

19
00:02:08,731 --> 00:02:11,483
I'm checking your hair and
the length of your skirts.

20
00:02:11,942 --> 00:02:15,696
Our school was known
for having strict rules

21
00:02:15,988 --> 00:02:21,160
and annoying teachers who believed
in military-like discipline.

22
00:02:22,202 --> 00:02:25,913
The "certification
for naturally curly hair" was

23
00:02:25,914 --> 00:02:27,416
conceived at this school.

24
00:02:29,001 --> 00:02:30,085
Stop.

25
00:02:31,795 --> 00:02:35,047
I told you
to submit the certification.

26
00:02:35,048 --> 00:02:37,092
Oh yeah... There.

27
00:02:37,468 --> 00:02:38,510
Mizushima!

28
00:02:39,178 --> 00:02:41,096
Reflect on your stupid behavior.

29
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:43,848
Sit facing the wall today.

30
00:02:43,849 --> 00:02:46,642
I've known Utako Komatsubara
since kindergarten.

31
00:02:46,643 --> 00:02:50,271
I thought of her
as a little brother until

32
00:02:50,272 --> 00:02:54,275
her breasts started growing
in 5th grade

33
00:02:54,276 --> 00:02:57,529
and I warily realized
she was a girl.

34
00:02:57,821 --> 00:03:00,573
A cat lover who's
good at drawing.

35
00:03:00,574 --> 00:03:05,829
Why do you always pull a stunt
like that? It won't fool anyone.

36
00:03:06,288 --> 00:03:08,624
Let's get it measured.

37
00:03:09,416 --> 00:03:11,376
Stop playing games.

38
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:23,680
As usual,
Junon is quick to react down there.

39
00:03:24,223 --> 00:03:27,142
But there was no rule
to prohibit that.

40
00:03:31,605 --> 00:03:34,608
"Don't cry, Mother?"

41
00:03:35,692 --> 00:03:38,111
She would if she could see you now.

42
00:03:39,112 --> 00:03:42,323
I don't care who told you
to sit like that.

43
00:03:42,324 --> 00:03:43,617
Face forward.

44
00:03:44,618 --> 00:03:45,994
Thank you.

45
00:03:46,662 --> 00:03:49,915
You two, switch places.

46
00:03:50,457 --> 00:03:54,294
Hayase, help him study.

47
00:04:14,189 --> 00:04:17,608
Is that clear?
Two right triangles.

48
00:04:17,609 --> 00:04:19,152
Mana Hayase.

49
00:04:19,486 --> 00:04:23,824
The daughter of a reputable doctor
and the best student in school.

50
00:04:24,324 --> 00:04:27,702
She has a thick,
invisible wall around herself

51
00:04:27,703 --> 00:04:31,415
but everybody can't help
looking at her.

52
00:04:31,915 --> 00:04:35,210
But... she gets on my nerves.

53
00:04:51,393 --> 00:04:54,562
Let's go to the bookshop
after school.

54
00:04:54,563 --> 00:04:57,149
I wanna listen to this
on your big speakers.

55
00:04:57,774 --> 00:05:01,027
This is ancient.
Where did you excavate this?

56
00:05:01,028 --> 00:05:04,030
Use my machine
for only the latest CDs.

57
00:05:04,031 --> 00:05:08,284
One steps back into the future
by reflecting on the past.

58
00:05:08,285 --> 00:05:10,953
You sound like a phony evangelist.

59
00:05:10,954 --> 00:05:11,997
Butt poke!

60
00:05:13,707 --> 00:05:17,084
You reveal things
that ordinary people don't.

61
00:05:17,085 --> 00:05:18,045
Because you're honest.

62
00:05:18,046 --> 00:05:20,213
Also honest down there.

63
00:05:20,339 --> 00:05:21,757
Shut up.

64
00:05:22,132 --> 00:05:23,258
So childish.

65
00:05:25,510 --> 00:05:27,678
Girls are nice and complicated.

66
00:05:27,679 --> 00:05:30,515
Too bad I can't show you.

67
00:05:31,808 --> 00:05:33,517
Let me see.

68
00:05:33,518 --> 00:05:34,269
Kosuke.

69
00:05:34,270 --> 00:05:36,355
What? This?

70
00:05:36,897 --> 00:05:38,272
I wanna listen.

71
00:05:38,273 --> 00:05:39,398
You should join us.

72
00:05:39,399 --> 00:05:41,484
Junon has huge speakers.

73
00:05:41,485 --> 00:05:44,029
Cool. Wanna come?

74
00:05:44,821 --> 00:05:47,448
No. I'm not interested
in that person.

75
00:05:47,449 --> 00:05:49,284
Who do you like?

76
00:05:50,494 --> 00:05:51,787
Beethoven.

77
00:05:52,996 --> 00:05:54,414
Beethoven?

78
00:05:56,959 --> 00:06:00,253
But I'd like to study pop music.

79
00:06:00,921 --> 00:06:02,255
Study?

80
00:06:03,131 --> 00:06:04,674
Come to my place.

81
00:06:04,675 --> 00:06:07,260
My mom has many Beethoven CDs.

82
00:06:07,427 --> 00:06:09,595
I like
listening to Beethoven alone.

83
00:06:09,596 --> 00:06:10,931
Sorry.

84
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:15,394
- Sorry.
- No big deal.

85
00:06:16,269 --> 00:06:19,146
I'm gonna have my "bento-ven".

86
00:06:19,147 --> 00:06:20,147
What?

87
00:06:21,441 --> 00:06:22,484
Lunch.

88
00:06:24,569 --> 00:06:26,529
You're so nice to the guys.

89
00:06:26,530 --> 00:06:30,408
If you were nice to them,
they'd go crazy.

90
00:06:30,409 --> 00:06:31,660
What do you mean?

91
00:06:35,539 --> 00:06:37,790
Am I too uptight?

92
00:06:37,791 --> 00:06:40,544
That's what's so endearing
about you.

93
00:06:41,294 --> 00:06:43,463
And that sweet, coy face.

94
00:06:43,588 --> 00:06:45,799
My brain is half male.

95
00:06:45,924 --> 00:06:47,050
What?

96
00:06:47,884 --> 00:06:48,802
Wicked.

97
00:06:48,803 --> 00:06:49,970
What?

98
00:06:50,262 --> 00:06:51,013
Wicked.

99
00:06:51,013 --> 00:06:51,805
What is?

100
00:06:51,805 --> 00:06:52,514
Wicked.

101
00:06:52,514 --> 00:06:53,390
What's wicked?

102
00:06:53,391 --> 00:06:55,016
You guys hungry?

103
00:06:55,017 --> 00:06:56,225
Wanna go to Gojuban?

104
00:06:56,226 --> 00:06:57,728
- I'm in.
- Me too.

105
00:07:03,775 --> 00:07:06,445
Let's ride after the girls
part of the way.

106
00:07:06,737 --> 00:07:07,946
Seriously?

107
00:07:08,447 --> 00:07:09,447
Okay!

108
00:07:09,656 --> 00:07:12,034
No riding bikes inside the gate.

109
00:07:12,242 --> 00:07:13,744
We'll get in trouble.

110
00:07:26,048 --> 00:07:28,925
I'm jealous of those bike seats.

111
00:07:29,801 --> 00:07:31,720
Be a bike seat when you grow up.

112
00:07:32,429 --> 00:07:33,429
I will.

113
00:07:34,264 --> 00:07:35,307
There they are!

114
00:07:35,432 --> 00:07:36,265
Girls!

115
00:07:36,266 --> 00:07:38,143
Targets in sight!

116
00:07:40,687 --> 00:07:42,105
I win!

117
00:07:42,773 --> 00:07:47,360
A portrait of youth that's seen
all around the world.

118
00:07:49,905 --> 00:07:51,573
The elements of youth are

119
00:07:51,948 --> 00:07:56,453
ambition, uncertainty,
delusion, sexual desire.

120
00:07:56,578 --> 00:07:59,164
Regret, humiliation.

121
00:08:00,665 --> 00:08:02,959
And first love.

122
00:08:05,545 --> 00:08:07,046
- Papa.
- Yes?

123
00:08:07,047 --> 00:08:09,215
- Two meat buns.
- Me too.

124
00:08:09,216 --> 00:08:10,675
Okay.

125
00:08:10,967 --> 00:08:12,927
Mama, four dumplings.

126
00:08:12,928 --> 00:08:14,846
Okay. In a minute.

127
00:08:16,264 --> 00:08:17,516
"Here's the delivery meal".

128
00:08:17,641 --> 00:08:19,725
It's for the Satos so no onions.

129
00:08:19,726 --> 00:08:22,394
"I thought it was for the Katos".

130
00:08:22,395 --> 00:08:23,687
Satos, not Katos.

131
00:08:23,688 --> 00:08:25,482
"Sato? As in sugar?"

132
00:08:25,607 --> 00:08:27,109
Not sugar. Onions.

133
00:08:27,275 --> 00:08:29,569
"Onions? Oh, the Negishis".

134
00:08:29,694 --> 00:08:31,279
Forget it. I'll do it.

135
00:08:32,197 --> 00:08:33,865
This is Yohei.

136
00:08:34,157 --> 00:08:35,909
His dad is Taiwanese.

137
00:08:36,201 --> 00:08:41,248
His mom is Japanese and
Yohei goes by her family name, Ohno.

138
00:08:41,790 --> 00:08:43,625
He's an outstanding student

139
00:08:43,792 --> 00:08:47,337
and acts
like he's too good for us.

140
00:08:49,422 --> 00:08:53,468
Hey... You guys are gonna
listen to the CD, right?

141
00:08:53,969 --> 00:08:55,011
Yeah.

142
00:09:01,351 --> 00:09:02,686
Can I join you?

143
00:09:03,395 --> 00:09:04,520
Opening up to us?

144
00:09:04,521 --> 00:09:05,647
Of course you can come.

145
00:09:06,565 --> 00:09:08,357
I'm gonna go listen to music.

146
00:09:08,358 --> 00:09:09,316
Good for you.

147
00:09:09,317 --> 00:09:11,903
I was worried
because he studies too much.

148
00:09:12,863 --> 00:09:14,238
Your Japanese is improving.

149
00:09:14,239 --> 00:09:15,322
Definitely.

150
00:09:15,323 --> 00:09:16,283
Practicing?

151
00:09:16,284 --> 00:09:18,451
Practicing.

152
00:09:20,328 --> 00:09:23,247
I saw a kitten in
front of Takagi Shrine.

153
00:09:23,248 --> 00:09:25,541
I think it was just born.

154
00:09:25,542 --> 00:09:26,542
Really?

155
00:09:26,877 --> 00:09:27,877
I'll go check it out.

156
00:09:27,878 --> 00:09:29,713
You're not going to Junon's?

157
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:31,214
The kitten first.

158
00:09:31,756 --> 00:09:34,467
Maybe Kosuke will pass by.

159
00:09:34,926 --> 00:09:38,512
What kind of person
is Kosuke Mizushima?

160
00:09:38,513 --> 00:09:40,222
A childhood friend, right?

161
00:09:40,223 --> 00:09:41,266
Yeah.

162
00:09:42,058 --> 00:09:44,644
His hair has always been
naturally curly.

163
00:09:44,811 --> 00:09:48,064
He thought
it'd eventually grow straight.

164
00:09:49,733 --> 00:09:51,358
How should I put it?

165
00:09:51,359 --> 00:09:54,446
Inside, he's both...

166
00:09:55,280 --> 00:09:57,573
an artist and a criminal.

167
00:09:57,574 --> 00:09:59,451
I think it confuses him.

168
00:09:59,659 --> 00:10:01,828
That's why he acts weird
on purpose.

169
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:03,412
Criminal?

170
00:10:03,413 --> 00:10:05,457
Yeah... Maybe.

171
00:10:05,916 --> 00:10:08,376
He's more a cat

172
00:10:08,752 --> 00:10:10,295
than a dog.

173
00:10:11,671 --> 00:10:12,881
What does that mean?

174
00:10:14,841 --> 00:10:15,717
I'm going home.

175
00:10:15,718 --> 00:10:16,884
See you tomorrow.

176
00:10:16,885 --> 00:10:18,053
Yeah, tomorrow.

177
00:10:29,439 --> 00:10:34,069
"Hayase Clinic"

178
00:11:00,053 --> 00:11:01,221
Utako.

179
00:11:01,930 --> 00:11:05,141
I decided
not to go to Junon's today.

180
00:11:06,184 --> 00:11:08,852
She doesn't look well.
I'm gonna stay here.

181
00:11:08,853 --> 00:11:11,105
A cat is more important
than friends?

182
00:11:11,106 --> 00:11:13,358
Of course.
It goes without saying.

183
00:11:13,566 --> 00:11:15,484
You shortened your skirt.

184
00:11:15,485 --> 00:11:17,319
I'm free outside school.

185
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:18,738
Your panties will show.

186
00:11:20,949 --> 00:11:22,157
Wanna peek?

187
00:11:22,158 --> 00:11:24,243
I'm wearing Spiderman today.

188
00:11:24,244 --> 00:11:25,745
No thanks.

189
00:11:26,121 --> 00:11:29,082
See ya.
We're gonna go listen to the CD.

190
00:11:29,416 --> 00:11:31,458
"Every time"

191
00:11:31,459 --> 00:11:33,168
"we say goodbye"

192
00:11:33,169 --> 00:11:34,963
"I die a little".

193
00:11:36,006 --> 00:11:37,256
Again?

194
00:11:37,257 --> 00:11:39,633
"Every time we say goodbye

195
00:11:39,634 --> 00:11:42,012
I die a little".

196
00:11:43,430 --> 00:11:45,889
You've said that 1,000 times

197
00:11:45,890 --> 00:11:48,476
but you never die.
You keep growing.

198
00:11:54,524 --> 00:11:57,235
Right... See you tomorrow.

199
00:11:57,485 --> 00:11:58,653
Yeah.

200
00:12:13,418 --> 00:12:14,794
This is my house.

201
00:12:15,086 --> 00:12:19,841
A humble tofu shop that
my great grandfather opened.

202
00:12:37,108 --> 00:12:38,651
I'm so hot.

203
00:12:44,199 --> 00:12:44,866
Nice and cool.

204
00:12:44,867 --> 00:12:45,949
Hi.

205
00:12:45,950 --> 00:12:48,494
Find something to eat
in the freezer.

206
00:12:48,495 --> 00:12:51,289
I ate already and I'm going out.

207
00:12:51,539 --> 00:12:52,665
Going out?

208
00:12:53,124 --> 00:12:55,460
It's already September.

209
00:12:55,627 --> 00:12:58,213
College entrance exams
are coming up.

210
00:12:58,797 --> 00:13:00,632
Do you have a girlfriend?

211
00:13:01,007 --> 00:13:02,592
Not interested.

212
00:13:03,510 --> 00:13:04,886
Beer.

213
00:13:05,053 --> 00:13:06,221
Nice and cool.

214
00:13:10,850 --> 00:13:13,228
- I'm going now.
- Okay!

215
00:13:13,478 --> 00:13:17,481
Your mom is working part-time
to send you to college.

216
00:13:17,482 --> 00:13:18,691
For me?

217
00:13:19,025 --> 00:13:21,111
For a spa retreat.

218
00:13:21,361 --> 00:13:22,529
What?

219
00:13:23,488 --> 00:13:26,574
I got a call
from your homeroom teacher.

220
00:13:26,825 --> 00:13:29,577
A certification
for naturally curly hair?

221
00:13:29,786 --> 00:13:31,830
I'll go talk to her.

222
00:13:32,038 --> 00:13:34,707
Dad, don't bother.

223
00:13:35,417 --> 00:13:37,001
- You sure?
- Yeah.

224
00:13:38,294 --> 00:13:39,629
Nice and cool.

225
00:13:41,548 --> 00:13:42,590
It's so hot.

226
00:13:52,183 --> 00:13:53,183
"Enemy"

227
00:13:59,232 --> 00:14:02,193
Master, I have returned.

228
00:14:03,445 --> 00:14:05,363
Wonton. Chow mein.

229
00:14:12,078 --> 00:14:16,749
"Oiwakeya Inn"

230
00:14:18,793 --> 00:14:20,003
Yo.

231
00:14:25,133 --> 00:14:26,468
Go inside.

232
00:14:26,801 --> 00:14:27,801
Um...

233
00:14:29,262 --> 00:14:30,346
Where are the girls?

234
00:14:30,847 --> 00:14:32,139
Utako's not coming.

235
00:14:32,140 --> 00:14:35,477
I meant... Mana Hayase...

236
00:14:36,728 --> 00:14:38,730
So that's why you came.

237
00:14:39,647 --> 00:14:43,193
No, no, no... Let's go.

238
00:15:03,004 --> 00:15:04,964
Us four, Mana, Utako.

239
00:15:05,465 --> 00:15:07,383
And another guy
I'll introduce later.

240
00:15:08,176 --> 00:15:10,552
Unrequited love
starts swirling in

241
00:15:10,553 --> 00:15:13,181
multiple directions
among us seven.

242
00:15:14,516 --> 00:15:16,809
It can only be described
as youth.

243
00:15:21,397 --> 00:15:23,691
Isn't male bonding great?

244
00:15:23,942 --> 00:15:24,984
You're a dork.

245
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:28,154
But a big bath
is definitely great.

246
00:15:29,864 --> 00:15:31,573
Yohei has a crush on Mana.

247
00:15:31,574 --> 00:15:32,825
Hey!

248
00:15:34,202 --> 00:15:37,329
I'm more an Utako fan.

249
00:15:37,330 --> 00:15:38,581
Really?

250
00:15:39,290 --> 00:15:40,290
Hey...

251
00:15:40,416 --> 00:15:45,129
People used to call Mana
"outdated ethics" last year.

252
00:15:45,338 --> 00:15:46,130
Why?

253
00:15:46,131 --> 00:15:47,882
Because she's old-fashioned.

254
00:15:48,466 --> 00:15:50,510
"Outdated ethics", huh...

255
00:15:51,553 --> 00:15:54,764
No wonder
she thinks we're childish.

256
00:16:02,981 --> 00:16:04,190
Junon...

257
00:16:04,524 --> 00:16:05,983
This is the men's bath.

258
00:16:05,984 --> 00:16:09,237
I'm sorry... I'm sorry...

259
00:16:09,946 --> 00:16:11,281
I'm sorry.

260
00:16:52,030 --> 00:16:53,656
Mana...

261
00:17:15,053 --> 00:17:16,471
Impossible.

262
00:17:21,434 --> 00:17:25,480
Numbers and symbols don't
have any appeal whatsoever.

263
00:17:30,693 --> 00:17:35,448
Master,
I'd like to stop thinking

264
00:17:35,698 --> 00:17:37,992
and go to sleep now.

265
00:17:38,576 --> 00:17:41,746
Sweet and sour pork.
Spring rolls.

266
00:17:42,747 --> 00:17:43,956
Yes, sir.

267
00:17:55,051 --> 00:17:56,177
Stand up.

268
00:17:58,888 --> 00:18:00,014
Bow.

269
00:18:03,476 --> 00:18:06,688
Open your textbooks to page 38.

270
00:18:13,361 --> 00:18:16,864
Don't tell me
you forgot to bring it.

271
00:18:29,585 --> 00:18:30,837
You again?

272
00:18:32,630 --> 00:18:36,092
No certification. No textbook.

273
00:18:36,426 --> 00:18:38,094
Why are you here?

274
00:18:38,678 --> 00:18:40,513
To eat lunch?

275
00:18:41,556 --> 00:18:44,308
Lunch is important.

276
00:18:45,268 --> 00:18:48,353
Then what's the point
of attending class?

277
00:18:48,354 --> 00:18:49,939
Face the wall.

278
00:19:30,396 --> 00:19:33,190
"Mana is pretty if

279
00:19:33,191 --> 00:19:34,984
she wasn't so serious"

280
00:19:54,045 --> 00:19:56,047
Apple of his eye?

281
00:20:18,778 --> 00:20:21,072
A person that is loved...

282
00:20:22,824 --> 00:20:24,075
more than any other?

283
00:20:39,048 --> 00:20:40,925
- Are you buying something?
- Um?

284
00:20:41,175 --> 00:20:42,385
Yeah.

285
00:21:05,324 --> 00:21:06,534
What do you want?

286
00:21:08,536 --> 00:21:09,912
Thank you.

287
00:21:11,497 --> 00:21:12,915
Whatever.

288
00:21:13,749 --> 00:21:15,710
I'm used to it.

289
00:21:17,336 --> 00:21:19,338
Tell me something.

290
00:21:20,047 --> 00:21:21,132
Tell you what?

291
00:21:21,382 --> 00:21:25,344
Why don't you study math
for the college exams?

292
00:21:29,390 --> 00:21:32,393
How are integrals
and logarithms useful?

293
00:21:33,185 --> 00:21:36,898
We don't know.
That's the point.

294
00:21:37,315 --> 00:21:39,524
Looking for answers

295
00:21:39,525 --> 00:21:42,820
with pure language,
not spoken words.

296
00:21:43,487 --> 00:21:46,823
When I open a math textbook

297
00:21:46,824 --> 00:21:49,619
I stop being me and

298
00:21:49,952 --> 00:21:53,372
turn into a serious daughter
of a doctor.

299
00:22:15,144 --> 00:22:16,437
Idiot.

300
00:22:58,312 --> 00:22:59,897
This is Kento Machida.

301
00:23:00,731 --> 00:23:03,191
His dad works at a tire factory.

302
00:23:03,192 --> 00:23:06,695
Since he was a kid,
he used tires to

303
00:23:06,696 --> 00:23:09,907
develop muscle and increase
lung capacity.

304
00:23:11,117 --> 00:23:15,121
An athletic genius and a leading
competitor in a variety of sports.

305
00:23:18,416 --> 00:23:19,416
Come.

306
00:23:20,876 --> 00:23:22,586
Yes!

307
00:23:45,317 --> 00:23:46,652
Kento...

308
00:23:47,653 --> 00:23:50,489
When did you start taekwondo?

309
00:23:50,614 --> 00:23:53,242
Um... Day before yesterday.

310
00:23:56,996 --> 00:23:58,622
This is depressing.

311
00:23:59,248 --> 00:24:02,877
I've been practicing Chinese
martial arts for a year.

312
00:24:03,169 --> 00:24:05,880
Talent is something
you're born with.

313
00:24:06,422 --> 00:24:08,049
I'm not consoled.

314
00:24:09,759 --> 00:24:12,595
I thought
you're focusing on basketball.

315
00:24:13,095 --> 00:24:16,098
Martial arts
is part of my training.

316
00:24:16,265 --> 00:24:18,058
I'm emulating the great Ichiro,

317
00:24:18,059 --> 00:24:20,686
not trying
to get physically bigger.

318
00:24:22,813 --> 00:24:26,901
I hope you have a talent
for something too.

319
00:24:33,074 --> 00:24:34,825
Mana Hayase.

320
00:25:08,859 --> 00:25:12,196
Your back looks like
it's steaming.

321
00:25:14,824 --> 00:25:16,450
I was practicing.

322
00:25:18,119 --> 00:25:19,286
You're early.

323
00:25:19,787 --> 00:25:23,582
My brothers nag at me so
I study here in the morning.

324
00:25:24,750 --> 00:25:28,253
Utako said you have twin
brothers who are both doctors.

325
00:25:28,254 --> 00:25:29,338
That's right.

326
00:25:30,422 --> 00:25:33,968
The stethoscope rumba
and the endoscope samba?

327
00:25:34,343 --> 00:25:35,344
What's that?

328
00:25:38,597 --> 00:25:43,144
"In the morning, exercising stimulates
the brain more than studying".

329
00:25:43,602 --> 00:25:47,857
"For breakfast, protein is better
than carbs for the brain".

330
00:25:48,274 --> 00:25:50,316
"Intelligence runs in the family

331
00:25:50,317 --> 00:25:54,155
so take advantage of your DNA".

332
00:25:55,281 --> 00:25:57,825
They won't stop pestering me.

333
00:26:01,245 --> 00:26:03,371
Can I go watch?

334
00:26:03,372 --> 00:26:04,372
Huh?

335
00:26:06,333 --> 00:26:07,459
Oh yeah.

336
00:26:09,461 --> 00:26:10,504
Look.

337
00:26:10,921 --> 00:26:13,424
Utako drew this.
It's exactly like them.

338
00:26:14,300 --> 00:26:16,217
You also want to be a doctor?

339
00:26:16,218 --> 00:26:19,430
I don't think I'm cut out for it.

340
00:26:20,181 --> 00:26:21,223
Why not?

341
00:26:22,850 --> 00:26:24,809
When I was small,

342
00:26:24,810 --> 00:26:27,646
I peered into a window
of a patient's room.

343
00:26:28,355 --> 00:26:32,026
The curtain was fluttering
and I could see inside...

344
00:26:33,319 --> 00:26:34,528
Then?

345
00:26:35,988 --> 00:26:39,532
A gaunt young woman
was lying on the bed

346
00:26:39,533 --> 00:26:42,578
with her bony knees sticking out.

347
00:26:43,287 --> 00:26:46,122
Two flies were flying around her.

348
00:26:46,123 --> 00:26:50,502
One of them came
and flew into my forehead.

349
00:26:51,837 --> 00:26:54,798
It apparently made me pass out.

350
00:26:59,887 --> 00:27:01,597
You're talkative today.

351
00:27:02,598 --> 00:27:05,016
I just don't talk during class.

352
00:27:05,017 --> 00:27:10,021
You two are too close
to each other.

353
00:27:10,022 --> 00:27:11,315
What's your problem?

354
00:27:12,191 --> 00:27:14,193
This movement.

355
00:27:14,401 --> 00:27:16,277
It stimulates the brain.

356
00:27:16,278 --> 00:27:18,696
American scientists proved it.

357
00:27:18,697 --> 00:27:21,951
How long were you listening to us?

358
00:27:23,869 --> 00:27:27,957
I wasn't. I didn't hear anything
about two flies.

359
00:27:29,625 --> 00:27:31,293
He's like my brothers.

360
00:27:34,797 --> 00:27:38,175
Surprisingly, Mana is cute
once she starts talking.

361
00:27:38,550 --> 00:27:39,885
And Kento too.

362
00:27:41,428 --> 00:27:42,805
I guess he's cute.

363
00:27:43,806 --> 00:27:46,892
Year 1956.

364
00:27:47,184 --> 00:27:51,522
The Japan-Soviet Joint Declaration.

365
00:27:53,023 --> 00:27:56,944
Japan and the Soviet Union
made a joint declaration.

366
00:27:57,403 --> 00:28:00,446
The treaty with the Soviets

367
00:28:00,447 --> 00:28:02,657
did not sit well
with the Americans.

368
00:28:02,658 --> 00:28:04,535
They were perplexed.

369
00:28:04,868 --> 00:28:10,332
What choices did Japan have
during the Cold War?

370
00:28:10,457 --> 00:28:11,958
A difficult decision.

371
00:28:11,959 --> 00:28:13,085
What?

372
00:28:13,335 --> 00:28:14,503
You were sleeping.

373
00:28:15,129 --> 00:28:18,465
I chose Japanese history
as an elective.

374
00:28:18,674 --> 00:28:23,137
I'm talking about your duty as
a student, not about the exam.

375
00:28:23,554 --> 00:28:27,057
Show some respect for the teacher
who's trying to teach us.

376
00:28:29,143 --> 00:28:30,602
"Outdated ethics".

377
00:28:32,187 --> 00:28:33,564
That hurts.

378
00:28:35,274 --> 00:28:37,484
Hayase, are you listening?

379
00:28:37,818 --> 00:28:38,818
Yes.

380
00:28:39,611 --> 00:28:42,989
Even if it's not
on the college entrance exams

381
00:28:42,990 --> 00:28:46,618
studying world history will be
helpful in your future.

382
00:28:46,952 --> 00:28:47,952
For example

383
00:28:48,829 --> 00:28:52,416
when Japan lost the war,
the British prime minister said

384
00:28:53,584 --> 00:28:56,252
"You cannot deal with the most
serious things in the world"

385
00:28:56,253 --> 00:29:01,050
"unless you also understand
the most amusing".

386
00:29:01,467 --> 00:29:02,676
Did you hear that?

387
00:29:03,761 --> 00:29:04,803
Ow...

388
00:29:05,179 --> 00:29:06,263
Hayase.

389
00:29:06,805 --> 00:29:11,852
Give me a quote by another
famous person in history.

390
00:29:17,733 --> 00:29:19,734
"Anybody can become angry".

391
00:29:19,735 --> 00:29:22,945
"But to be angry
at the right time and"

392
00:29:22,946 --> 00:29:26,700
"for the right purpose is
not within everybody's power".

393
00:29:29,828 --> 00:29:31,580
Practice that.

394
00:29:32,247 --> 00:29:34,540
Right purpose...

395
00:29:34,541 --> 00:29:38,503
A useful concept
for everyday life.

396
00:29:38,504 --> 00:29:39,629
Who said that?

397
00:29:39,630 --> 00:29:41,006
Aristotle.

398
00:29:44,635 --> 00:29:45,636
A friend of yours?

399
00:29:47,638 --> 00:29:48,889
Him?

400
00:29:49,640 --> 00:29:52,226
No. He also wears clothes.

401
00:29:52,976 --> 00:29:55,187
Next. Komatsubara.

402
00:29:55,729 --> 00:29:56,729
Yes.

403
00:29:57,147 --> 00:29:58,649
Your favorite quote?

404
00:30:05,823 --> 00:30:09,033
"Keep doing
what you can't stop doing".

405
00:30:09,034 --> 00:30:11,452
"Be lazy".

406
00:30:11,453 --> 00:30:14,039
"Believe in an invisible world".

407
00:30:14,289 --> 00:30:16,750
What? Who said that?

408
00:30:17,209 --> 00:30:18,919
Comic artist Shigeru Mizuki.

409
00:30:25,592 --> 00:30:27,302
That one struck a chord.

410
00:30:34,309 --> 00:30:35,519
Hey.

411
00:30:47,698 --> 00:30:51,577
Why do you keep poking me
with that?

412
00:30:51,910 --> 00:30:53,327
A math test.

413
00:30:53,328 --> 00:30:55,330
Finish it by tomorrow.

414
00:30:55,497 --> 00:30:58,459
Will you get off my back?

415
00:31:01,128 --> 00:31:03,046
It really is math.

416
00:31:10,137 --> 00:31:11,597
Now what?

417
00:31:12,055 --> 00:31:15,267
A textbook I found most helpful.

418
00:31:15,601 --> 00:31:17,518
Study the marked problems.

419
00:31:17,519 --> 00:31:19,730
You'll do better
in your next test.

420
00:31:22,816 --> 00:31:26,486
You have to pass this stage
sooner or later.

421
00:31:26,487 --> 00:31:29,531
Later is fine with me.

422
00:31:30,949 --> 00:31:33,326
"I count him braver who

423
00:31:33,327 --> 00:31:35,996
overcomes his desire".

424
00:31:38,749 --> 00:31:40,292
Mr. Aristotle.

425
00:31:40,792 --> 00:31:43,253
Listen to the forefather.

426
00:31:44,671 --> 00:31:47,633
Why kindly order me around?

427
00:31:49,510 --> 00:31:51,470
I don't want to scorn you.

428
00:31:52,429 --> 00:31:54,973
I get scorned
for a math test score?

429
00:31:55,349 --> 00:31:57,141
What I scorn is

430
00:31:57,142 --> 00:32:00,771
someone who makes no effort
but belittles other people's.

431
00:32:01,772 --> 00:32:05,108
Who'd do that... "totle"?

432
00:32:06,527 --> 00:32:07,653
Childish.

433
00:33:01,748 --> 00:33:02,916
What?

434
00:33:03,041 --> 00:33:04,167
The test.

435
00:33:23,812 --> 00:33:25,480
You bombed it.

436
00:33:25,897 --> 00:33:27,899
You didn't read the textbook.

437
00:33:29,985 --> 00:33:33,113
The answer to this problem
is in there.

438
00:33:33,697 --> 00:33:36,408
And this formula
doesn't work for this.

439
00:33:37,326 --> 00:33:38,910
Correct them in 10 minutes.

440
00:33:39,286 --> 00:33:42,288
You'll lose time
for your own studies.

441
00:33:42,289 --> 00:33:46,334
It's okay. I get distracted when
I'm frustrated by someone.

442
00:33:46,335 --> 00:33:49,755
It's even more time consuming
and a waste of life.

443
00:33:51,506 --> 00:33:54,133
That's harsh.

444
00:33:54,134 --> 00:33:56,470
Here's the next test.

445
00:34:21,995 --> 00:34:25,499
Kosuke was reading a textbook
in the courtyard.

446
00:34:26,041 --> 00:34:27,041
Was he?

447
00:34:28,001 --> 00:34:29,377
Is he still there?

448
00:34:29,378 --> 00:34:31,421
We should leave him alone.

449
00:34:34,925 --> 00:34:36,176
You're dedicated.

450
00:34:36,802 --> 00:34:39,221
Is it love or maternal instinct?

451
00:34:42,349 --> 00:34:45,310
I think it's more like sympathy.

452
00:34:46,812 --> 00:34:48,980
Oh... That's a noble sentiment.

453
00:34:51,358 --> 00:34:53,985
Is it like the way
I feel toward cats?

454
00:34:55,195 --> 00:34:56,947
You're being silly.

455
00:35:02,703 --> 00:35:04,371
They're hopeless.

456
00:35:07,624 --> 00:35:10,669
When will I ever use this?

457
00:35:14,172 --> 00:35:15,881
Let's go. Hurry.

458
00:35:15,882 --> 00:35:17,467
Wait up.

459
00:35:23,557 --> 00:35:26,976
He studied all night
and practiced in the morning.

460
00:35:26,977 --> 00:35:28,562
Did his brain awaken?

461
00:35:28,854 --> 00:35:31,689
Awaken and now asleep.
He's not used to this.

462
00:35:31,690 --> 00:35:33,441
He was studying?

463
00:35:33,442 --> 00:35:36,653
Reading a difficult textbook
Mana lent him.

464
00:35:36,945 --> 00:35:37,945
Mana?

465
00:35:37,946 --> 00:35:39,488
Yeah. He asked me to

466
00:35:39,489 --> 00:35:41,323
explain some problems.

467
00:35:41,324 --> 00:35:43,118
He should've asked Yohei.

468
00:35:43,618 --> 00:35:46,705
Strong pride.
Weak academic skills.

469
00:35:53,754 --> 00:35:55,547
Who ate my fried rice?

470
00:35:57,507 --> 00:35:58,592
Ikki?

471
00:36:02,429 --> 00:36:05,264
What was that "aha" for?

472
00:36:05,265 --> 00:36:06,807
You sounded lewd.

473
00:36:06,808 --> 00:36:09,393
It was a legitimate "aha".

474
00:36:09,394 --> 00:36:13,106
My brain understands
and is crying out with joy.

475
00:36:13,648 --> 00:36:16,567
You like talking about the brain
these days.

476
00:36:16,568 --> 00:36:18,153
Stop bothering me.

477
00:36:20,405 --> 00:36:23,158
Are you starting to panic?

478
00:36:23,492 --> 00:36:27,119
You're my son so you're smart.

479
00:36:27,120 --> 00:36:28,288
It's just that

480
00:36:28,455 --> 00:36:31,040
you're also your dad's son.

481
00:36:31,041 --> 00:36:33,710
There's your problem.

482
00:36:34,169 --> 00:36:37,005
Anyway, study hard.

483
00:36:41,843 --> 00:36:42,844
Thanks.

484
00:36:49,726 --> 00:36:52,229
Yohei Ohno, 89 points.

485
00:36:54,648 --> 00:36:57,192
- You could do better.
- Yes, sir.

486
00:36:58,401 --> 00:37:00,027
- Kaori Kikuchi.
- Yes.

487
00:37:00,028 --> 00:37:01,279
60 points.

488
00:37:02,405 --> 00:37:03,447
Try harder next time.

489
00:37:03,448 --> 00:37:04,699
I will.

490
00:37:04,950 --> 00:37:06,493
Kosuke Mizushima.

491
00:37:08,954 --> 00:37:10,372
76 points.

492
00:37:10,664 --> 00:37:12,916
Seriously? You traitor.

493
00:37:13,542 --> 00:37:15,417
I'm a born genius.

494
00:37:15,418 --> 00:37:17,796
The result of sitting
in front of Hayase?

495
00:37:18,088 --> 00:37:20,005
Can I sit behind her now?

496
00:37:20,006 --> 00:37:22,384
- Pointless, so no.
- Okay.

497
00:37:23,718 --> 00:37:26,054
Mana Hayase, 89 points.

498
00:37:27,889 --> 00:37:29,724
You and Ohno had the best scores.

499
00:37:32,602 --> 00:37:35,230
Yuta Jinno, 53 points.

500
00:37:36,940 --> 00:37:38,275
Yumi Sato.

501
00:37:41,111 --> 00:37:45,574
I'll give you
harder practice problems.

502
00:37:48,451 --> 00:37:51,621
How is studying like this
useful to me?

503
00:37:52,914 --> 00:37:57,711
It's important to try without
expecting something in return.

504
00:38:01,548 --> 00:38:04,259
Another lesson in ethics.

505
00:38:05,719 --> 00:38:07,970
How is being childish

506
00:38:07,971 --> 00:38:10,223
useful to you?

507
00:38:24,404 --> 00:38:27,866
Kento is amazing.
He's good at everything.

508
00:38:28,658 --> 00:38:32,537
You're watching him?
Not them?

509
00:38:35,582 --> 00:38:37,791
You interested in someone?

510
00:38:37,792 --> 00:38:39,210
No one in particular.

511
00:38:43,423 --> 00:38:46,635
Your nose bleeds when you lie.
You're so nice.

512
00:38:53,642 --> 00:38:54,851
You like Kento?

513
00:39:02,025 --> 00:39:03,401
Here we go.

514
00:39:05,779 --> 00:39:06,988
I won't tell.

515
00:39:07,113 --> 00:39:08,113
Thanks.

516
00:39:14,371 --> 00:39:18,500
But his brain and nerves
are made of muscle.

517
00:39:31,763 --> 00:39:34,391
Why are you wearing underwear?

518
00:39:34,724 --> 00:39:39,020
And why are you drinking
so early in the day?

519
00:39:39,646 --> 00:39:41,106
Did something happen?

520
00:39:41,481 --> 00:39:43,774
Nothing to speak of.

521
00:39:43,775 --> 00:39:47,320
Just feeling the weight of
a lot of little things.

522
00:39:48,113 --> 00:39:49,614
Kosuke...

523
00:39:50,365 --> 00:39:54,035
I think we'll have to close
our tofu shop.

524
00:39:54,411 --> 00:39:56,329
- Really?
- Yeah.

525
00:39:58,373 --> 00:40:00,125
I should get a job.

526
00:40:00,583 --> 00:40:03,420
Not before the exams.
We'll manage until then.

527
00:40:03,628 --> 00:40:06,131
We have 6-months' worth of

528
00:40:06,923 --> 00:40:08,550
frozen soy pulp I can sell.

529
00:40:08,842 --> 00:40:11,219
Soy pulp is good for health.

530
00:40:11,845 --> 00:40:13,430
Take off your underwear.

531
00:40:14,222 --> 00:40:17,017
No need to hide anything
from your family.

532
00:40:18,476 --> 00:40:20,729
Your mom should also get naked.

533
00:40:21,438 --> 00:40:22,438
She should.

534
00:40:23,064 --> 00:40:25,108
Don't be ridiculous.

535
00:40:26,568 --> 00:40:29,404
Papa, are the meat buns ready?

536
00:40:29,529 --> 00:40:32,657
Yep. Two, right?

537
00:40:32,866 --> 00:40:34,199
Just one starting today.

538
00:40:34,200 --> 00:40:35,994
- On a diet?
- No.

539
00:40:36,119 --> 00:40:38,079
"A teenager on a diet?"

540
00:40:39,289 --> 00:40:41,040
It's normal these days.

541
00:40:41,041 --> 00:40:43,500
- Or they'll look like you.
- True.

542
00:40:43,501 --> 00:40:47,088
"That's so sweet.
You're flattering me".

543
00:40:47,297 --> 00:40:48,297
Hi.

544
00:40:49,007 --> 00:40:52,343
You're getting close to Mana
these days.

545
00:40:53,970 --> 00:40:55,013
Yohei.

546
00:40:55,305 --> 00:40:57,806
Now is not the time
for delusions.

547
00:40:57,807 --> 00:40:59,309
Studying comes first.

548
00:40:59,726 --> 00:41:01,436
Look who's talking.

549
00:41:02,604 --> 00:41:03,980
Me.

550
00:41:25,460 --> 00:41:26,753
No...

551
00:41:28,046 --> 00:41:30,423
I must not embrace defeat.

552
00:41:32,008 --> 00:41:33,218
No!

553
00:41:38,264 --> 00:41:40,599
A ship from China with tons of

554
00:41:40,600 --> 00:41:42,559
human hair for hair extensions

555
00:41:42,560 --> 00:41:45,312
sank in the Sea of Japan.

556
00:41:45,313 --> 00:41:46,689
They might come drifting.

557
00:41:47,273 --> 00:41:49,900
Not from the Sea of Japan.

558
00:41:49,901 --> 00:41:51,443
Let's go check out Akakura Dam.

559
00:41:51,444 --> 00:41:52,653
Will they reach the dam?

560
00:41:52,654 --> 00:41:53,738
It was a joke.

561
00:41:55,907 --> 00:41:57,784
I know another scary story.

562
00:41:58,618 --> 00:42:00,537
When you sit in front
of that wall

563
00:42:01,538 --> 00:42:05,415
you can hear voices of students
from the past.

564
00:42:05,416 --> 00:42:06,416
You're kidding.

565
00:42:06,876 --> 00:42:09,337
I'm not. From here.

566
00:42:09,963 --> 00:42:11,714
- Are you serious?
- Yeah.

567
00:42:17,470 --> 00:42:18,470
Kosuke.

568
00:42:18,972 --> 00:42:21,682
Stop teasing Mana.
She has a pure heart.

569
00:42:21,683 --> 00:42:23,559
You were teasing me?

570
00:42:23,560 --> 00:42:25,686
No. I was showing affection.

571
00:42:25,687 --> 00:42:26,521
You're mean.

572
00:42:26,522 --> 00:42:28,188
I didn't think
you'd believe me.

573
00:42:28,189 --> 00:42:32,652
Why not?
Dead people live on in our brains.

574
00:42:35,321 --> 00:42:36,321
I see.

575
00:43:00,889 --> 00:43:03,099
Why do I have to be here
at night?

576
00:43:08,605 --> 00:43:10,815
You're freaked out by that story.

577
00:43:12,192 --> 00:43:14,777
I can't concentrate.
Sit in front of me.

578
00:43:17,447 --> 00:43:19,407
So demanding...

579
00:43:29,292 --> 00:43:30,835
That's also distracting.

580
00:43:31,336 --> 00:43:32,336
Here.

581
00:43:33,004 --> 00:43:35,256
With all these empty seats?

582
00:43:35,590 --> 00:43:36,590
Yeah.

583
00:43:53,441 --> 00:43:54,567
Dessert.

584
00:43:57,612 --> 00:44:00,073
You want me to eat it whole?

585
00:44:00,615 --> 00:44:03,952
Huh? Are you a princess
or something?

586
00:44:05,161 --> 00:44:07,497
I'll take it home. Thanks.

587
00:44:38,069 --> 00:44:39,070
Beautiful.

588
00:44:47,328 --> 00:44:48,954
We should keep studying.

589
00:44:48,955 --> 00:44:50,665
Do some math problems.

590
00:44:50,790 --> 00:44:53,793
Don't get cocky with 76 points.

591
00:44:55,378 --> 00:44:57,046
I can do it if I try.

592
00:44:57,547 --> 00:44:58,880
I'll beat you next time.

593
00:44:58,881 --> 00:45:02,051
Impossible. I'm teaching you.

594
00:45:05,013 --> 00:45:06,431
Wanna bet?

595
00:45:06,681 --> 00:45:08,016
You're so confident.

596
00:45:08,808 --> 00:45:11,977
The loser has to change
his or her hairstyle

597
00:45:11,978 --> 00:45:14,355
according to the winner's request.

598
00:45:15,398 --> 00:45:18,192
So you'll have to shave
your head.

599
00:45:19,319 --> 00:45:21,821
If I win,
a ponytail for a month.

600
00:45:22,030 --> 00:45:24,824
Fine. Ponytail or pigtails.

601
00:45:25,033 --> 00:45:26,492
I won't lose.

602
00:45:29,579 --> 00:45:32,290
Joan of Arc. Sei Shonagon.

603
00:45:32,874 --> 00:45:34,167
Takako Doi.

604
00:45:35,543 --> 00:45:37,879
I like competitive women.

605
00:45:43,092 --> 00:45:44,677
I'll study.

606
00:46:10,286 --> 00:46:11,621
That hurts.

607
00:46:30,765 --> 00:46:32,850
Step by step.

608
00:46:33,601 --> 00:46:35,311
Face to face.

609
00:46:40,566 --> 00:46:42,193
Shut up!

610
00:46:43,528 --> 00:46:47,532
I'm studying English very hard.

611
00:46:56,916 --> 00:46:59,000
Mouse. Mouse. Mouse.

612
00:46:59,001 --> 00:47:00,920
The Incredible Butt Shaker.

613
00:47:20,273 --> 00:47:22,733
I am happy.

614
00:47:28,281 --> 00:47:32,368
I am a genius!

615
00:47:51,304 --> 00:47:55,056
"I didn't grow
by winning all the time".

616
00:47:55,057 --> 00:47:57,225
"Losing made me strong".

617
00:47:57,226 --> 00:47:58,560
You're a sore loser.

618
00:47:58,561 --> 00:48:00,395
Saori Yoshida's words.

619
00:48:00,396 --> 00:48:02,023
Let's bet again.

620
00:48:02,440 --> 00:48:04,525
You like to bet, don't you?

621
00:48:04,859 --> 00:48:05,859
I guess I do.

622
00:48:07,195 --> 00:48:08,571
I hate to admit it

623
00:48:09,238 --> 00:48:11,532
but Mana could be charming.

624
00:50:26,083 --> 00:50:28,543
Don't get rice on my head.

625
00:50:28,544 --> 00:50:30,212
I'll look like a rice ball.

626
00:50:30,796 --> 00:50:32,214
Where did you get it cut?

627
00:50:33,215 --> 00:50:37,178
You know that convenience store
near the Kotobuki projects?

628
00:50:37,470 --> 00:50:40,306
It was about 50 meters from there.

629
00:50:40,514 --> 00:50:43,893
But it was gone
when I passed by this morning.

630
00:50:44,143 --> 00:50:46,646
The barber
was a freaky-looking creature.

631
00:50:47,438 --> 00:50:49,522
Maybe it was a different world.

632
00:50:49,523 --> 00:50:52,233
A parallel universe
in a barber shop?

633
00:50:52,234 --> 00:50:53,152
A mystery, huh?

634
00:50:53,152 --> 00:50:53,986
Lame.

635
00:50:53,987 --> 00:50:55,905
Did I really get a haircut?

636
00:50:56,822 --> 00:50:57,947
You definitely did.

637
00:50:57,948 --> 00:50:59,075
Yeah but...

638
00:51:32,191 --> 00:51:34,694
I like girls with ponytails.

639
00:51:35,361 --> 00:51:36,696
Damn it.

640
00:51:37,279 --> 00:51:39,990
Just when I was trying to move on...

641
00:51:43,703 --> 00:51:46,038
I don't know why she decided to

642
00:51:46,455 --> 00:51:48,124
wear a ponytail.

643
00:51:48,999 --> 00:51:50,292
But...

644
00:51:50,876 --> 00:51:53,546
I felt encouraged all the same.

645
00:52:07,852 --> 00:52:08,853
Stand up.

646
00:52:17,695 --> 00:52:20,071
I'm Fujihira

647
00:52:20,072 --> 00:52:23,075
in charge of this school's security.

648
00:52:25,244 --> 00:52:29,456
There was a theft today
in the accounts office.

649
00:52:29,457 --> 00:52:34,294
The safe for storing reserve funds
was broken into

650
00:52:34,295 --> 00:52:38,966
and approximately 870,000 yen
was stolen.

651
00:52:40,801 --> 00:52:44,637
We believe
the break-in occurred at 6:59

652
00:52:44,638 --> 00:52:47,891
when we received
an automated notification.

653
00:52:47,892 --> 00:52:51,896
We arrived here at 7:14
to confirm the theft.

654
00:52:52,271 --> 00:52:53,271
Excuse me.

655
00:52:54,356 --> 00:52:55,566
What does that have to do

656
00:52:56,400 --> 00:52:59,612
with this class?

657
00:53:00,905 --> 00:53:02,698
You should suspect outsiders first.

658
00:53:03,449 --> 00:53:04,700
Now listen.

659
00:53:05,284 --> 00:53:08,077
In the 30 minutes before
and after 7:00

660
00:53:08,078 --> 00:53:10,872
nobody entered the school grounds.

661
00:53:10,873 --> 00:53:13,291
The only people here were

662
00:53:13,292 --> 00:53:17,254
Mr. Tokuoka, the physics teacher,
and 3 students.

663
00:53:18,339 --> 00:53:20,007
Three students from this class.

664
00:53:20,716 --> 00:53:21,801
I was here.

665
00:53:22,510 --> 00:53:25,346
I was here too with Kosuke.

666
00:53:25,471 --> 00:53:26,639
Me too.

667
00:53:28,599 --> 00:53:33,187
Then I'd like the three of you
to come with me.

668
00:53:34,855 --> 00:53:36,732
Are you suspecting us?

669
00:53:38,734 --> 00:53:40,861
Sounds like you're already
accusing us.

670
00:53:41,403 --> 00:53:42,571
No.

671
00:53:42,905 --> 00:53:46,074
I just want to hear your stories

672
00:53:46,075 --> 00:53:47,534
to make sure you're not involved.

673
00:53:47,535 --> 00:53:48,619
You're lying.

674
00:53:49,370 --> 00:53:51,747
You brought the security guy.

675
00:53:52,289 --> 00:53:54,708
You don't trust us at all.

676
00:53:56,293 --> 00:54:00,255
Does the school think
we're criminals?

677
00:54:00,256 --> 00:54:02,258
Don't be stupid.

678
00:54:02,591 --> 00:54:03,717
I think...

679
00:54:04,885 --> 00:54:06,470
you're wrong.

680
00:54:07,263 --> 00:54:08,055
Huh?

681
00:54:08,056 --> 00:54:11,517
If you want to interrogate us,
take us to the police.

682
00:54:12,059 --> 00:54:13,686
Not this security company.

683
00:54:15,688 --> 00:54:17,356
Here's your evidence.

684
00:54:18,357 --> 00:54:20,860
Go ahead. Check it out.

685
00:54:21,068 --> 00:54:23,111
Why suspect only us students?

686
00:54:23,112 --> 00:54:24,947
What about Mr. Tokuoka?!

687
00:54:26,282 --> 00:54:29,451
Stop it!
Unless you want to be suspended!

688
00:54:32,246 --> 00:54:33,581
This is wrong.

689
00:54:37,710 --> 00:54:39,336
Yeah! This is crazy!

690
00:54:50,264 --> 00:54:55,394
Mana, nobody's watching
so you can take it easy.

691
00:54:56,979 --> 00:54:59,522
Here. Ikki's tissue paper.

692
00:54:59,523 --> 00:55:00,523
Go ahead.

693
00:55:00,858 --> 00:55:03,694
Don't look at me.
This is embarrassing.

694
00:55:05,404 --> 00:55:07,031
Don't be embarrassed.

695
00:55:08,240 --> 00:55:10,409
I was impressed with you
for the first time.

696
00:55:12,202 --> 00:55:13,620
You also look cute crying.

697
00:55:13,621 --> 00:55:15,456
Just don't look at me.

698
00:55:21,670 --> 00:55:24,465
Math problems
always have correct answers.

699
00:55:25,174 --> 00:55:29,011
But some problems in life
are impossible to solve.

700
00:55:30,471 --> 00:55:32,598
The thief was never caught.

701
00:55:35,935 --> 00:55:37,686
Kosuke.

702
00:55:41,273 --> 00:55:42,858
Mana.

703
00:55:48,197 --> 00:55:50,491
When my hair grew
to its usual length...

704
00:55:50,699 --> 00:55:54,744
Three years ago
at our entrance ceremony...

705
00:55:54,745 --> 00:55:58,665
Mana represented our class
at the graduation ceremony.

706
00:55:58,666 --> 00:56:00,833
Our hopes for the future
were infinite

707
00:56:00,834 --> 00:56:03,212
but we couldn't see anything.

708
00:56:05,005 --> 00:56:07,924
But under
our instructors' supervision,

709
00:56:07,925 --> 00:56:09,968
we fostered friendship

710
00:56:09,969 --> 00:56:12,137
and we grew.

711
00:56:15,015 --> 00:56:17,642
This school is a backpack

712
00:56:17,643 --> 00:56:20,062
filled with memories.

713
00:56:22,564 --> 00:56:25,066
Carrying it on our backs

714
00:56:25,067 --> 00:56:27,485
we'll now spread our wings

715
00:56:27,486 --> 00:56:29,238
to follow our dreams.

716
00:56:32,741 --> 00:56:36,328
Let us fly
into a wonderful future.

717
00:56:53,679 --> 00:56:56,932
Sexual lust, be gone!

718
00:56:57,891 --> 00:57:00,477
So, have you decided?

719
00:57:01,311 --> 00:57:02,688
About what?

720
00:57:04,106 --> 00:57:06,400
Who you want to be with.

721
00:57:08,944 --> 00:57:10,946
You won't even tell me?

722
00:57:19,163 --> 00:57:20,205
If...

723
00:57:26,462 --> 00:57:29,298
Yeah. I knew it.

724
00:57:30,049 --> 00:57:31,383
I did.

725
00:57:34,178 --> 00:57:35,387
How about you?

726
00:57:38,515 --> 00:57:39,516
Mana.

727
00:57:39,725 --> 00:57:40,517
That's not fair.

728
00:57:40,518 --> 00:57:41,685
It's true.

729
00:57:43,103 --> 00:57:45,898
Let's stay together
even after we graduate.

730
00:57:46,273 --> 00:57:49,818
Of course.
Even if we go to different colleges.

731
00:57:51,278 --> 00:57:52,278
Yeah.

732
00:57:58,452 --> 00:58:02,748
Then we took the entrance exams
to the colleges of our choice.

733
00:58:32,277 --> 00:58:34,530
Does anyone want tofu?!

734
00:58:37,032 --> 00:58:39,409
Tofu, anyone?!

735
00:58:46,500 --> 00:58:47,917
They're such kids.

736
00:58:47,918 --> 00:58:48,918
Really.

737
00:58:49,503 --> 00:58:51,797
I used to hate childish behavior.

738
00:58:52,172 --> 00:58:53,298
And now?

739
00:59:04,059 --> 00:59:06,478
You really are so childish!

740
00:59:15,445 --> 00:59:18,115
I'm the king!

741
00:59:46,310 --> 00:59:47,352
Hey.

742
00:59:48,187 --> 00:59:50,689
What kind of adults will we be?

743
00:59:53,108 --> 00:59:55,944
What science are you going
to major in?

744
00:59:57,196 --> 01:00:00,532
I want to make mobile games.

745
01:00:00,782 --> 01:00:02,241
Playful ones.

746
01:00:02,242 --> 01:00:04,827
Nice. Me...

747
01:00:04,828 --> 01:00:07,079
I'm going to study design
in art school

748
01:00:07,080 --> 01:00:09,165
and develop cat toys.

749
01:00:09,166 --> 01:00:11,543
I want to be surrounded by cats!

750
01:00:13,462 --> 01:00:15,713
I don't care about college.

751
01:00:15,714 --> 01:00:20,302
I'm gonna go overseas to
work and study at different hotels

752
01:00:20,886 --> 01:00:23,721
and then expand our inn.

753
01:00:23,722 --> 01:00:25,974
- Expand this?
- No!

754
01:00:26,099 --> 01:00:28,684
I want to get
into the University of Tokyo

755
01:00:28,685 --> 01:00:32,396
and then go to a famous American
university on government funds

756
01:00:32,397 --> 01:00:33,690
to get an MBA.

757
01:00:34,942 --> 01:00:37,985
I want an N, not an M. The NBA.

758
01:00:37,986 --> 01:00:39,988
One day, I'll play in the US.

759
01:00:41,657 --> 01:00:43,450
You three are going abroad.

760
01:00:44,534 --> 01:00:45,701
And you, Mana?

761
01:00:45,702 --> 01:00:50,624
I was scared of dissection so
I didn't think I could be a doctor

762
01:00:51,124 --> 01:00:54,878
but I've been thinking
of studying psychiatry.

763
01:00:55,712 --> 01:00:58,507
A doctor, one way or the other.

764
01:00:59,258 --> 01:01:02,928
You can treat me when
I'm on the NBA injured list.

765
01:01:03,470 --> 01:01:06,055
She said she's going
to study psychiatry.

766
01:01:06,056 --> 01:01:09,100
I'll also fly in from wherever
to get an endoscopy.

767
01:01:09,101 --> 01:01:10,685
She said psychiatry.

768
01:01:10,686 --> 01:01:12,561
- Get an enema.
- You guys!

769
01:01:12,562 --> 01:01:13,688
That'd be cool.

770
01:01:13,689 --> 01:01:14,856
Listen!

771
01:01:15,065 --> 01:01:17,067
You're so childish, as usual.

772
01:01:18,819 --> 01:01:20,279
And finally, you?

773
01:01:24,616 --> 01:01:26,535
I want to be one hell of a guy.

774
01:01:30,622 --> 01:01:32,124
In what way?

775
01:01:36,295 --> 01:01:38,170
Someone whose presence can

776
01:01:38,171 --> 01:01:41,174
change the world a little bit.

777
01:02:31,141 --> 01:02:32,225
What's up?

778
01:02:36,772 --> 01:02:37,939
What's wrong?

779
01:03:06,510 --> 01:03:08,677
My first choice...

780
01:03:08,678 --> 01:03:10,055
I didn't make it.

781
01:03:13,767 --> 01:03:16,353
I was sure I would.

782
01:03:22,776 --> 01:03:26,822
I've been studying so hard
since middle school.

783
01:03:27,322 --> 01:03:31,660
Why did I fail the most
important test of my life?

784
01:04:40,270 --> 01:04:44,148
Our rival tofu shop
closed down first

785
01:04:44,149 --> 01:04:45,775
so our sales went back up and

786
01:04:46,193 --> 01:04:48,236
we were able to stay in business.

787
01:04:48,612 --> 01:04:50,071
Not yet?

788
01:04:52,324 --> 01:04:53,867
Not yet?

789
01:04:54,201 --> 01:04:56,327
Meow, meow.

790
01:04:56,328 --> 01:04:57,412
Shut up.

791
01:05:02,792 --> 01:05:04,711
What do you think?

792
01:05:05,754 --> 01:05:09,841
I think it's important
for the family to bond.

793
01:05:11,635 --> 01:05:14,012
Be brave and get undressed.

794
01:05:15,180 --> 01:05:16,848
Don't be ridiculous.

795
01:05:22,479 --> 01:05:25,148
Utako got accepted
to an art school in Tokyo.

796
01:05:26,316 --> 01:05:30,612
She was the first to leave town
in pursuit of her dream.

797
01:05:38,245 --> 01:05:40,872
Yohei made it
into the University of Tokyo.

798
01:05:41,498 --> 01:05:42,374
I'm going.

799
01:05:42,375 --> 01:05:46,127
"You made your grandpa in Taiwan
so happy".

800
01:05:47,462 --> 01:05:49,381
Be sure to eat well.

801
01:05:49,548 --> 01:05:51,716
Okay. See you.

802
01:05:58,139 --> 01:06:01,934
Kento's English
was too poor to get

803
01:06:01,935 --> 01:06:03,811
into an American university but

804
01:06:03,812 --> 01:06:04,979
he was accepted to one in Japan

805
01:06:04,980 --> 01:06:07,774
with a strong basketball team.

806
01:06:08,108 --> 01:06:09,401
"Mana"

807
01:06:14,364 --> 01:06:17,617
Ikki set his sights too high
and failed miserably.

808
01:06:17,993 --> 01:06:21,997
To his mom's delight, he's staying in
town to prepare for next year's exams.

809
01:06:22,956 --> 01:06:25,083
"Congratulations on your departure"

810
01:06:26,376 --> 01:06:29,671
Junon will be studying
hotel management in Nagoya.

811
01:06:30,005 --> 01:06:31,298
A solid choice.

812
01:06:31,840 --> 01:06:35,635
If there was a school for tofu
management, I might've gone there.

813
01:06:37,846 --> 01:06:40,890
Mana failed her first choice,
a national university

814
01:06:41,349 --> 01:06:44,561
but was accepted to a prestigious
private medical school.

815
01:06:50,817 --> 01:06:52,736
The moon in daylight
is also beautiful.

816
01:06:59,326 --> 01:07:01,620
Send me a photo of you
in a white coat.

817
01:07:03,705 --> 01:07:05,749
Undergrads don't wear one.

818
01:07:07,167 --> 01:07:09,918
She's a sympathetic
and caring person.

819
01:07:09,919 --> 01:07:12,296
Your T-shirt from the other day.

820
01:07:12,297 --> 01:07:13,882
She'll be a good doctor.

821
01:07:22,891 --> 01:07:23,892
This is from me.

822
01:07:28,688 --> 01:07:29,856
Let me see.

823
01:07:36,988 --> 01:07:38,239
It's an apple.

824
01:07:40,408 --> 01:07:41,743
Look it up in the dictionary.

825
01:07:42,661 --> 01:07:45,080
"The apple of my eye".

826
01:07:50,293 --> 01:07:52,379
Later. Okay?

827
01:07:54,339 --> 01:07:57,425
You're acting weirder than usual.

828
01:08:00,178 --> 01:08:01,471
What did you expect?

829
01:08:04,307 --> 01:08:06,518
You're going away.

830
01:08:11,272 --> 01:08:12,607
I'll miss you.

831
01:08:23,535 --> 01:08:26,913
The train will be arriving soon.

832
01:08:27,330 --> 01:08:31,835
Please stand behind
the yellow line.

833
01:09:03,992 --> 01:09:07,287
See ya. I'll be in touch.

834
01:09:08,913 --> 01:09:11,416
Yeah. Me too.

835
01:09:20,967 --> 01:09:24,345
Please beware of closing doors.

836
01:10:00,507 --> 01:10:04,385
I was accepted to a public college
in the prefecture.

837
01:10:05,011 --> 01:10:07,596
I moved out of home, the tofu shop,

838
01:10:07,597 --> 01:10:10,183
and entered
the brotherhood of a men's dorm.

839
01:10:39,796 --> 01:10:42,298
I slid into the department
of literature

840
01:10:42,882 --> 01:10:46,594
but as to what I wanted to do
or where I wanted to go

841
01:10:46,928 --> 01:10:48,471
I was clueless.

842
01:10:49,305 --> 01:10:50,431
"Incense Study Group"

843
01:10:55,770 --> 01:10:57,689
"Tea Ceremony Study Group"

844
01:11:06,656 --> 01:11:07,699
"Folk Dance Club"

845
01:11:09,868 --> 01:11:16,332
Embarrassing as it is, I had never
held a girl's hand before this.

846
01:11:18,167 --> 01:11:20,879
In the end, I joined this club.

847
01:11:21,129 --> 01:11:22,212
"Chinese Martial Arts Club"

848
01:11:22,213 --> 01:11:25,216
It was much more me
than folk dancing.

849
01:11:36,060 --> 01:11:41,649
At times, I was overwhelmed by
the desire to hear Mana's voice.

850
01:11:43,651 --> 01:11:44,652
Hello?

851
01:11:45,194 --> 01:11:46,863
How's Tokyo?

852
01:11:47,405 --> 01:11:49,489
There are so many people.

853
01:11:49,490 --> 01:11:52,368
The air feels thinner than home.

854
01:11:52,827 --> 01:11:54,829
I get tired so easily
when I go out.

855
01:11:55,705 --> 01:11:56,706
Oh yeah?

856
01:11:57,874 --> 01:12:00,126
There's a lot of oxygen here.

857
01:12:00,919 --> 01:12:02,587
A good place to open your clinic.

858
01:12:04,047 --> 01:12:07,216
I got a roommate.

859
01:12:08,593 --> 01:12:09,844
You moved in with someone?

860
01:12:09,969 --> 01:12:11,596
The daughter
of a respectable family?

861
01:12:12,388 --> 01:12:13,723
Don't worry.

862
01:12:14,098 --> 01:12:17,100
It's someone
who I feel comfortable with.

863
01:12:17,101 --> 01:12:19,103
Is it a guy?

864
01:12:20,563 --> 01:12:22,482
I'll put my roommate on the line.

865
01:12:22,607 --> 01:12:24,943
Don't bother. I don't know him.

866
01:12:25,276 --> 01:12:26,401
Hello.

867
01:12:26,402 --> 01:12:27,403
How are ya?

868
01:12:28,404 --> 01:12:29,363
It's me.

869
01:12:29,364 --> 01:12:30,448
Utako?!

870
01:12:30,698 --> 01:12:31,991
Correct.

871
01:12:32,325 --> 01:12:35,328
Mana is so fun to live with.

872
01:12:35,578 --> 01:12:38,705
She's surprisingly relaxed
and kind of an airhead.

873
01:12:38,706 --> 01:12:40,500
Super cute.

874
01:12:41,000 --> 01:12:42,335
What are you talking about?

875
01:12:42,585 --> 01:12:44,545
I'm getting jealous.

876
01:12:45,046 --> 01:12:45,713
Yeah, yeah.

877
01:12:45,714 --> 01:12:47,173
I'll put Mana back on.

878
01:12:49,884 --> 01:12:52,929
My batteries are dying.
I'll call again.

879
01:12:53,096 --> 01:12:55,390
Okay. Take care.

880
01:12:55,640 --> 01:12:57,725
Let me know how you're doing.

881
01:12:59,435 --> 01:13:02,105
I started practicing martial arts
for real.

882
01:13:08,111 --> 01:13:11,197
He's still into martial arts.

883
01:13:11,447 --> 01:13:15,701
I think he's attractive
when he's practicing.

884
01:13:15,702 --> 01:13:18,538
I keep thinking
about what you said.

885
01:13:19,205 --> 01:13:21,916
He's an artist
and a criminal, right?

886
01:13:22,709 --> 01:13:24,335
Did I say that?

887
01:13:24,836 --> 01:13:27,087
I know what you mean.

888
01:13:27,088 --> 01:13:29,632
We spent a lot of time
studying together.

889
01:13:32,135 --> 01:13:33,970
That's why you're not
his girlfriend?

890
01:13:37,515 --> 01:13:39,642
I don't know myself.

891
01:13:40,893 --> 01:13:42,228
Not yet anyway.

892
01:13:44,981 --> 01:13:46,357
To be honest...

893
01:13:48,359 --> 01:13:50,236
since we were kids

894
01:13:51,029 --> 01:13:52,947
I had a crush on him too.

895
01:13:56,242 --> 01:13:58,202
You really didn't know?

896
01:14:00,872 --> 01:14:01,914
But...

897
01:14:02,749 --> 01:14:04,625
when we started high school

898
01:14:05,168 --> 01:14:08,296
I still had feelings for him but

899
01:14:08,880 --> 01:14:11,966
he was more like a brother,
like a family member.

900
01:14:12,884 --> 01:14:14,844
That type of feeling.

901
01:14:16,471 --> 01:14:17,513
Oh...

902
01:14:20,099 --> 01:14:22,852
I want to see you two
get together.

903
01:14:23,936 --> 01:14:24,937
I mean it.

904
01:14:26,397 --> 01:14:27,565
Really?

905
01:14:28,107 --> 01:14:29,107
Yeah.

906
01:14:36,741 --> 01:14:38,076
Summer break.

907
01:14:40,036 --> 01:14:42,371
We promised to see each other.

908
01:15:39,512 --> 01:15:41,681
Look. There they are.

909
01:15:42,849 --> 01:15:43,849
See?

910
01:15:44,642 --> 01:15:46,561
I want this one.

911
01:15:47,812 --> 01:15:49,313
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

912
01:15:52,567 --> 01:15:53,567
Yuck.

913
01:15:54,026 --> 01:15:55,236
Just kidding.

914
01:16:02,034 --> 01:16:03,661
Step back a little. Okay.

915
01:16:04,203 --> 01:16:05,496
It should be here soon.

916
01:16:07,248 --> 01:16:08,291
Here it is.

917
01:16:09,167 --> 01:16:10,459
I got it.

918
01:16:12,628 --> 01:16:13,880
Hurry.

919
01:16:15,006 --> 01:16:16,215
It's gone.

920
01:16:16,966 --> 01:16:19,218
- I missed it.
- You did.

921
01:16:20,720 --> 01:16:23,097
I looked up the meaning
about the apple.

922
01:16:37,570 --> 01:16:38,779
You got me.

923
01:16:43,367 --> 01:16:46,662
Do you really feel that way
about me?

924
01:16:47,705 --> 01:16:49,749
You should know the answer.

925
01:16:50,666 --> 01:16:53,044
You think too highly of me.

926
01:16:53,544 --> 01:16:55,213
Overrating me.

927
01:16:55,379 --> 01:16:56,505
No, I'm not.

928
01:16:58,132 --> 01:17:01,676
It feels really strange.

929
01:17:01,677 --> 01:17:03,262
What's so strange?

930
01:17:03,721 --> 01:17:05,890
You don't know me.

931
01:17:07,892 --> 01:17:10,435
I'm a slob at home.

932
01:17:10,436 --> 01:17:12,396
I'm grouchy when I wake up.

933
01:17:13,439 --> 01:17:15,900
I lash out at Utako
over small things.

934
01:17:17,401 --> 01:17:20,446
There's nothing special about me.

935
01:17:24,367 --> 01:17:26,576
I think you fell in love with

936
01:17:26,577 --> 01:17:28,537
a girl in your imagination.

937
01:17:31,207 --> 01:17:33,709
We spent so much time together
in reality.

938
01:17:34,835 --> 01:17:36,879
You're not an imaginary figure.

939
01:17:40,383 --> 01:17:42,093
Tell me something.

940
01:17:42,718 --> 01:17:43,970
What do you like about me?

941
01:17:48,349 --> 01:17:49,642
I just do.

942
01:17:51,143 --> 01:17:54,605
Come on...
Give it some real thought.

943
01:17:55,273 --> 01:17:56,941
You're still so childish.

944
01:18:02,613 --> 01:18:03,781
Did she...

945
01:18:05,032 --> 01:18:06,701
just reject me?

946
01:18:28,097 --> 01:18:29,473
What's your wish?

947
01:18:30,683 --> 01:18:33,185
It won't come true
if you tell someone.

948
01:18:36,355 --> 01:18:39,066
I didn't know
what I truly wished for.

949
01:18:40,735 --> 01:18:43,738
I felt anxious because Mana
wrote hers without hesitation.

950
01:18:46,657 --> 01:18:48,534
I also didn't know how Mana felt.

951
01:18:50,077 --> 01:18:54,957
I wasn't being honest with myself
because I was afraid of the outcome.

952
01:18:56,250 --> 01:18:58,377
I felt so pathetic.

953
01:18:59,420 --> 01:19:00,504
Mana.

954
01:19:03,007 --> 01:19:04,467
How do you feel about me?

955
01:19:10,848 --> 01:19:11,682
You want to know?

956
01:19:11,683 --> 01:19:14,477
No. Don't tell me.

957
01:19:17,980 --> 01:19:19,190
You don't have to.

958
01:19:20,608 --> 01:19:22,443
But... Not now.

959
01:19:30,451 --> 01:19:31,952
Let me

960
01:19:32,536 --> 01:19:34,288
keep on loving you.

961
01:20:13,244 --> 01:20:15,162
To resolve my anxiety,

962
01:20:15,663 --> 01:20:18,374
I'll show the woman I love
how I've grown.

963
01:20:19,667 --> 01:20:23,087
It's the only thing I can do
for now.

964
01:20:37,893 --> 01:20:40,146
"Mixed Martial Arts Championship"

965
01:20:42,731 --> 01:20:45,985
Anybody interested in MMA
or combat sports?

966
01:20:48,237 --> 01:20:50,781
MMA championship!

967
01:21:00,291 --> 01:21:04,003
Let's see who's strongest.
Light your soul on fire.

968
01:21:12,636 --> 01:21:14,513
You have to come and watch.

969
01:21:14,847 --> 01:21:18,099
It's not some half-assed match
for fun.

970
01:21:18,100 --> 01:21:20,227
You punch and kick other people,
right?

971
01:21:20,769 --> 01:21:24,063
I don't want to see you do
that up close.

972
01:21:24,064 --> 01:21:25,816
It's like dissection.

973
01:21:26,317 --> 01:21:29,235
Face it square on and

974
01:21:29,236 --> 01:21:31,070
you'll notice what you overlooked.

975
01:21:31,071 --> 01:21:32,656
You think so?

976
01:21:33,908 --> 01:21:36,284
But combat sports
are like violence, right?

977
01:21:36,285 --> 01:21:37,369
Absolutely not.

978
01:21:37,828 --> 01:21:40,206
There's no hatred or animosity.

979
01:21:40,706 --> 01:21:42,958
It's an exercise
in soul searching.

980
01:21:43,667 --> 01:21:45,252
How should I put it?

981
01:21:45,836 --> 01:21:49,422
It's like a pure physical language
to search for

982
01:21:49,423 --> 01:21:52,384
the answer to a problem
unsolvable with words.

983
01:21:53,010 --> 01:21:55,596
It's like what math is to you.

984
01:21:59,475 --> 01:22:03,103
I don't really get it but I'll go.

985
01:22:04,730 --> 01:22:06,941
Cool. I'll be waiting.

986
01:22:24,291 --> 01:22:25,459
Master...

987
01:22:26,544 --> 01:22:28,003
give me power.

988
01:22:28,337 --> 01:22:31,548
I thought there were only
weaklings on campus but

989
01:22:31,549 --> 01:22:34,510
the captain of the taekwondo team
showed up.

990
01:22:42,768 --> 01:22:44,019
Bow.

991
01:22:48,732 --> 01:22:49,775
Put this on.

992
01:23:04,456 --> 01:23:05,456
Fight!

993
01:23:15,718 --> 01:23:16,718
Fight!

994
01:23:22,600 --> 01:23:24,059
No. Wait.

995
01:23:35,904 --> 01:23:38,157
Fight! Fight!

996
01:23:46,665 --> 01:23:48,042
Down!

997
01:23:48,751 --> 01:23:49,877
Go back!

998
01:23:56,842 --> 01:23:57,885
Counting.

999
01:24:32,628 --> 01:24:33,629
Fight!

1000
01:26:03,177 --> 01:26:04,428
Was it fun?

1001
01:26:05,804 --> 01:26:07,431
I'm glad you came.

1002
01:26:07,931 --> 01:26:10,141
I saw you and felt revived.

1003
01:26:10,142 --> 01:26:12,811
Answer me. Was it fun?

1004
01:26:15,230 --> 01:26:16,356
What's wrong?

1005
01:26:16,607 --> 01:26:19,568
What's the purpose of a match
like that?

1006
01:26:20,444 --> 01:26:23,113
It's exciting.
A battle between men.

1007
01:26:23,781 --> 01:26:27,284
I don't understand you at all.

1008
01:26:28,035 --> 01:26:29,828
Now more than ever.

1009
01:26:31,622 --> 01:26:34,165
Why? How come?

1010
01:26:34,166 --> 01:26:37,419
There are two people inside you.

1011
01:26:39,087 --> 01:26:42,090
Which one is real?

1012
01:26:42,633 --> 01:26:44,426
Which one should I watch?

1013
01:26:45,594 --> 01:26:47,137
I'm totally lost.

1014
01:26:49,223 --> 01:26:50,808
What are you talking about?

1015
01:26:52,726 --> 01:26:54,269
I'm me.

1016
01:26:55,062 --> 01:26:56,396
It's all me.

1017
01:26:57,397 --> 01:26:58,773
Why don't you understand?

1018
01:26:58,774 --> 01:27:02,151
What can you learn from violence?

1019
01:27:02,152 --> 01:27:04,279
I'm not doing it to learn.

1020
01:27:05,781 --> 01:27:07,282
You really are childish.

1021
01:27:10,410 --> 01:27:12,120
Yes, I am.

1022
01:27:14,832 --> 01:27:17,167
That's why I fell for you,
a model student

1023
01:27:18,460 --> 01:27:20,045
and kept chasing you.

1024
01:27:26,927 --> 01:27:28,679
Why don't you stop?

1025
01:27:43,777 --> 01:27:44,777
Idiot!

1026
01:27:46,405 --> 01:27:48,155
I know I am.

1027
01:27:48,156 --> 01:27:49,658
A real idiot!

1028
01:27:53,120 --> 01:27:55,037
You don't get it at all!

1029
01:27:55,038 --> 01:27:56,415
I sure don't!

1030
01:28:02,421 --> 01:28:04,840
Growing up is cruel.

1031
01:28:06,300 --> 01:28:08,385
Girls mature faster.

1032
01:28:09,761 --> 01:28:12,222
And guys don't realize it.

1033
01:28:48,425 --> 01:28:49,718
Did you hear?

1034
01:28:49,885 --> 01:28:52,929
Hear what?
I'm at work right now.

1035
01:28:52,930 --> 01:28:54,514
Mana broke up.

1036
01:28:56,058 --> 01:28:58,435
Mana broke up with Kosuke.

1037
01:29:00,312 --> 01:29:01,688
She did, huh?

1038
01:29:12,157 --> 01:29:14,284
Kosuke and Mana broke up?

1039
01:29:14,618 --> 01:29:18,205
I have mixed feelings
but this is my chance.

1040
01:29:18,455 --> 01:29:22,375
I see...
You still weren't over Mana.

1041
01:29:22,376 --> 01:29:23,669
I'll be in touch.

1042
01:29:30,884 --> 01:29:32,844
Kento made his move quickly.

1043
01:29:33,637 --> 01:29:34,638
However...

1044
01:29:35,555 --> 01:29:37,349
his motorbike was too slow.

1045
01:29:37,808 --> 01:29:40,727
Yohei was the winner in the end.

1046
01:29:41,603 --> 01:29:47,234
To think about, this is the
first time we're alone together.

1047
01:29:48,902 --> 01:29:50,696
I always knew...

1048
01:29:52,155 --> 01:29:54,282
that you were in love with Kosuke.

1049
01:29:57,411 --> 01:29:59,537
I lack childishness.

1050
01:29:59,538 --> 01:30:01,540
Something you don't like.

1051
01:30:03,834 --> 01:30:05,836
I was always jealous of Kosuke

1052
01:30:07,004 --> 01:30:08,880
when you picked on him.

1053
01:30:12,300 --> 01:30:15,178
You looked beautiful when you did.

1054
01:30:15,887 --> 01:30:17,806
I always watched you from afar.

1055
01:30:21,560 --> 01:30:22,769
I want us to

1056
01:30:24,021 --> 01:30:25,772
talk more like this.

1057
01:30:29,609 --> 01:30:31,069
Take your time

1058
01:30:32,404 --> 01:30:34,406
to get to know me.

1059
01:30:43,290 --> 01:30:44,957
Junon told me that Yohei and Mana

1060
01:30:44,958 --> 01:30:47,836
dated for 6 months
before breaking up.

1061
01:30:49,629 --> 01:30:52,882
I wasn't surprised
or angry or jealous.

1062
01:30:52,883 --> 01:30:55,385
I was miserable beyond words

1063
01:30:55,886 --> 01:31:00,098
and made no contact with Yohei
much less Mana

1064
01:31:00,724 --> 01:31:02,434
for 2 and a half years.

1065
01:31:09,983 --> 01:31:12,694
There was a big hole in my heart

1066
01:31:13,737 --> 01:31:15,572
that couldn't be filled.

1067
01:31:17,491 --> 01:31:23,288
I'm going to have to live with
my mistake for the rest of my life.

1068
01:31:54,444 --> 01:31:55,444
Earthquake.

1069
01:31:56,905 --> 01:31:57,905
It's an earthquake.

1070
01:32:07,040 --> 01:32:08,500
Let's get out of here.

1071
01:32:09,417 --> 01:32:10,418
Shit.

1072
01:32:18,677 --> 01:32:19,677
Excuse me.

1073
01:32:19,678 --> 01:32:21,345
Emergency earthquake alarm.

1074
01:32:21,346 --> 01:32:26,767
At 19:42, there was an extremely
strong tremor exceeding level 6

1075
01:32:26,768 --> 01:32:29,895
in a wide region
along the Pacific coastline.

1076
01:32:29,896 --> 01:32:32,524
Aftershocks are expected.

1077
01:33:27,245 --> 01:33:28,245
Sorry.

1078
01:33:31,249 --> 01:33:33,210
Hello? Kosuke?

1079
01:33:33,752 --> 01:33:35,003
Are you okay?

1080
01:33:35,795 --> 01:33:38,340
Yes, I'm fine. You?

1081
01:33:39,424 --> 01:33:40,592
I'm okay.

1082
01:33:41,676 --> 01:33:43,345
It was pretty big though.

1083
01:33:44,512 --> 01:33:46,556
I'm just glad you're safe.

1084
01:33:49,643 --> 01:33:50,977
We haven't talked...

1085
01:33:52,479 --> 01:33:53,855
in over 2 years.

1086
01:33:56,691 --> 01:33:57,859
Yeah.

1087
01:34:01,404 --> 01:34:02,864
How have you been?

1088
01:34:03,949 --> 01:34:05,951
Studying all the time as always.

1089
01:34:06,534 --> 01:34:08,662
Are you still punching people?

1090
01:34:10,956 --> 01:34:13,959
I haven't done that in a while.

1091
01:34:15,377 --> 01:34:16,628
That's good.

1092
01:34:26,346 --> 01:34:27,639
Do you have a boyfriend?

1093
01:34:30,100 --> 01:34:31,267
I might never find someone

1094
01:34:31,268 --> 01:34:33,687
who'll love me as much as you did.

1095
01:34:37,607 --> 01:34:39,234
That's touching.

1096
01:34:39,734 --> 01:34:40,860
You haven't changed.

1097
01:34:45,740 --> 01:34:46,740
Mana...

1098
01:34:47,659 --> 01:34:49,286
I have a question.

1099
01:34:51,121 --> 01:34:53,248
Why you didn't become
my girlfriend?

1100
01:34:55,208 --> 01:34:56,626
I'm not sure.

1101
01:34:59,296 --> 01:35:01,840
Probably because I was uncertain.

1102
01:35:03,383 --> 01:35:05,801
If we had gotten closer

1103
01:35:05,802 --> 01:35:09,180
I thought you'd be disappointed
to find out that

1104
01:35:09,431 --> 01:35:11,308
I'm not who you thought I was.

1105
01:35:13,643 --> 01:35:18,314
I also couldn't understand
your fascination with martial arts

1106
01:35:18,315 --> 01:35:20,066
or your mood swings.

1107
01:35:22,235 --> 01:35:25,363
I didn't know what you wanted and

1108
01:35:26,281 --> 01:35:28,366
I was afraid to get close.

1109
01:35:30,035 --> 01:35:31,161
I see.

1110
01:35:42,839 --> 01:35:44,341
The moon's beautiful.

1111
01:35:45,300 --> 01:35:46,760
Can you see it?

1112
01:35:51,348 --> 01:35:52,474
Yes.

1113
01:35:53,516 --> 01:35:56,227
We saw a moon like this once.

1114
01:36:00,148 --> 01:36:01,941
That night in the classroom...

1115
01:36:03,276 --> 01:36:05,111
It was a beautiful moon.

1116
01:36:06,071 --> 01:36:07,822
The day I cut my hair.

1117
01:36:08,782 --> 01:36:12,118
No. That was the night
of the rainstorm.

1118
01:36:13,036 --> 01:36:14,162
Was it?

1119
01:36:14,454 --> 01:36:15,955
I'm sure of it.

1120
01:36:17,290 --> 01:36:18,707
I used to think that

1121
01:36:18,708 --> 01:36:23,088
if you had cut
your hair on a moonlit night

1122
01:36:23,838 --> 01:36:26,508
and if I were the one
who cut your hair

1123
01:36:27,175 --> 01:36:32,222
we'd be together as a couple
right now.

1124
01:36:34,057 --> 01:36:36,017
Don't ask me why.

1125
01:36:46,236 --> 01:36:47,278
Mana...

1126
01:36:48,822 --> 01:36:50,698
Do you believe
in parallel universes?

1127
01:36:53,326 --> 01:36:58,331
A different reality that exists
at the same time.

1128
01:37:00,250 --> 01:37:01,835
In that world, we're...

1129
01:37:05,255 --> 01:37:06,631
together as a couple.

1130
01:37:09,384 --> 01:37:10,969
We'd be going out on dates.

1131
01:37:15,974 --> 01:37:17,642
I wish it were true.

1132
01:37:30,697 --> 01:37:32,699
Thank you for

1133
01:37:33,992 --> 01:37:35,535
falling in love with me.

1134
01:37:57,056 --> 01:37:59,516
Even as a senior in college

1135
01:37:59,517 --> 01:38:02,562
I still didn't know
where I was headed.

1136
01:38:04,230 --> 01:38:07,191
I'd quit martial arts halfway

1137
01:38:07,192 --> 01:38:12,238
and applied for jobs that
didn't really interest me but

1138
01:38:12,697 --> 01:38:17,160
I was rejected by them all and
ended up in school for another year.

1139
01:38:20,038 --> 01:38:23,958
But after I told Mana
about parallel universes

1140
01:38:24,626 --> 01:38:28,004
I developed an urge to write
about imaginary worlds.

1141
01:38:29,214 --> 01:38:31,840
The thought came to me
from nowhere

1142
01:38:31,841 --> 01:38:35,428
but I kept writing
for no one in particular.

1143
01:38:38,139 --> 01:38:40,891
A few online novels I concocted

1144
01:38:40,892 --> 01:38:43,228
caught the attention of publishers

1145
01:38:43,853 --> 01:38:46,564
and enabled me to get by
after graduation.

1146
01:38:47,690 --> 01:38:52,028
But I still didn't know what
I truly wanted to write

1147
01:38:52,737 --> 01:38:57,200
and I was a nobody
like I always had been.

1148
01:39:16,886 --> 01:39:17,971
Hello?

1149
01:39:19,013 --> 01:39:22,100
Are you busy, former classmate?

1150
01:39:23,268 --> 01:39:24,561
Not at all.

1151
01:39:25,395 --> 01:39:28,398
There's something I wanted to
tell you before anyone else.

1152
01:39:28,982 --> 01:39:31,401
You want to practice surgery
on me?

1153
01:39:31,901 --> 01:39:33,194
You're way off mark.

1154
01:39:34,404 --> 01:39:38,533
Then... you want me
to fall for you again?

1155
01:39:39,242 --> 01:39:40,743
That's not possible.

1156
01:39:44,789 --> 01:39:50,795
"A worthwhile dream
is one that is laughed at".

1157
01:39:56,509 --> 01:39:58,011
Hey, hurry up.

1158
01:39:58,803 --> 01:40:00,305
The bride is waiting.

1159
01:40:13,151 --> 01:40:14,402
Knock it off.

1160
01:40:14,944 --> 01:40:18,531
The first time we're together
since the day at the sea.

1161
01:40:20,158 --> 01:40:23,952
I never thought
Kosuke would become a novelist.

1162
01:40:23,953 --> 01:40:26,246
You finally found your talent.

1163
01:40:26,247 --> 01:40:27,665
You could say that.

1164
01:40:27,999 --> 01:40:29,333
You're always on TV.

1165
01:40:29,334 --> 01:40:32,002
Kento's dream about the NBA
still hasn't come true.

1166
01:40:32,003 --> 01:40:35,798
But he's a famous professional
player in the country.

1167
01:40:35,965 --> 01:40:37,090
You live in Singapore now.

1168
01:40:37,091 --> 01:40:38,175
I'm going back tomorrow.

1169
01:40:38,176 --> 01:40:40,677
The price of living
is so damn high.

1170
01:40:40,678 --> 01:40:43,013
Junon has been working
in hotels around the world

1171
01:40:43,014 --> 01:40:44,682
and is still amidst his studies.

1172
01:40:46,017 --> 01:40:48,978
He won't be taking over
his family business just yet.

1173
01:40:49,520 --> 01:40:51,813
I'll be traveling through
that region next month.

1174
01:40:51,814 --> 01:40:54,942
Yohei works for the government now

1175
01:40:55,318 --> 01:40:58,488
and achieved his dream
of studying in the US.

1176
01:40:58,946 --> 01:41:02,282
Amazing. You're serving our country.

1177
01:41:02,283 --> 01:41:04,577
You're a big shot president
of an IT company.

1178
01:41:05,495 --> 01:41:07,621
Ikki found an Indian boyfriend

1179
01:41:07,622 --> 01:41:11,417
and a mobile app they developed
became a huge hit.

1180
01:41:11,751 --> 01:41:14,878
My partner is a huge fan of yours.

1181
01:41:14,879 --> 01:41:16,130
Really?

1182
01:41:16,339 --> 01:41:19,466
Utako studied graphic art
in art school

1183
01:41:19,467 --> 01:41:23,262
and made it big
with her cat products and blog.

1184
01:41:23,388 --> 01:41:24,721
Thank you.

1185
01:41:24,722 --> 01:41:26,683
I'm glad we're all here.

1186
01:41:27,642 --> 01:41:30,435
I thought Kosuke was the groom.

1187
01:41:30,436 --> 01:41:32,729
I also thought you two
would get back together.

1188
01:41:32,730 --> 01:41:36,734
No... Not in this lifetime.

1189
01:41:37,652 --> 01:41:39,237
It's time.

1190
01:41:39,362 --> 01:41:41,072
You're right. Let's go.

1191
01:41:41,447 --> 01:41:42,573
Thanks.

1192
01:41:42,865 --> 01:41:43,908
I'm getting nervous.

1193
01:41:49,205 --> 01:41:50,456
Junon!

1194
01:41:51,249 --> 01:41:52,542
Why?

1195
01:41:52,917 --> 01:41:54,252
I felt it.

1196
01:41:54,419 --> 01:41:56,670
- Sorry.
- Our youth.

1197
01:41:56,671 --> 01:41:57,713
This?

1198
01:41:57,714 --> 01:42:00,632
Have you met her husband?

1199
01:42:00,633 --> 01:42:02,885
Yeah. He came over a few times.

1200
01:42:03,553 --> 01:42:04,803
What is he like?

1201
01:42:04,804 --> 01:42:06,722
He's much older than Mana.

1202
01:42:06,723 --> 01:42:08,141
A surgeon.

1203
01:42:08,641 --> 01:42:10,475
- A doctor.
- I wanted a chance.

1204
01:42:10,476 --> 01:42:11,560
Too late.

1205
01:42:11,561 --> 01:42:14,605
You should stick out your foot
and trip him.

1206
01:42:16,315 --> 01:42:18,568
Ladies and gentlemen,
here they are.

1207
01:42:18,985 --> 01:42:21,195
The bride and the groom.

1208
01:42:21,988 --> 01:42:23,488
Trip him.

1209
01:42:23,489 --> 01:42:24,949
Be quiet.

1210
01:43:19,504 --> 01:43:21,088
It was a revelation.

1211
01:43:25,218 --> 01:43:27,678
If you truly love someone

1212
01:43:29,138 --> 01:43:32,016
you can wish for her
to be loved and cared for

1213
01:43:32,767 --> 01:43:34,727
from the bottom of your heart.

1214
01:43:36,229 --> 01:43:38,356
For her everlasting happiness.

1215
01:43:45,655 --> 01:43:49,783
- Very nice. Thank you.
- Thank you.

1216
01:43:49,784 --> 01:43:51,035
Congratulations.

1217
01:43:51,410 --> 01:43:52,869
Next, please.

1218
01:43:52,870 --> 01:43:55,164
Okay. Good.

1219
01:43:56,082 --> 01:43:57,166
Smile, please.

1220
01:43:57,291 --> 01:43:58,417
Okay.

1221
01:43:59,460 --> 01:44:01,712
Nice. Here we go.

1222
01:44:02,004 --> 01:44:03,005
Smile.

1223
01:44:04,382 --> 01:44:07,175
You should've done that
when they entered the room.

1224
01:44:07,176 --> 01:44:08,426
But that's weird too.

1225
01:44:08,427 --> 01:44:11,888
Mr. Happy Groom, I have a favor.

1226
01:44:11,889 --> 01:44:12,890
What is it?

1227
01:44:13,182 --> 01:44:14,600
Will you...

1228
01:44:16,477 --> 01:44:18,479
let me kiss the bride?

1229
01:44:18,604 --> 01:44:19,605
Idiot.

1230
01:44:20,523 --> 01:44:21,983
If it's okay with her.

1231
01:44:24,902 --> 01:44:25,902
Yes.

1232
01:44:28,447 --> 01:44:29,447
Wait.

1233
01:44:30,324 --> 01:44:34,036
I'll have to make sure how
you're going to kiss her.

1234
01:44:34,412 --> 01:44:37,790
Kiss me first.
That's the condition.

1235
01:44:37,999 --> 01:44:39,875
That's more than I can handle.

1236
01:44:39,876 --> 01:44:40,418
Yeah.

1237
01:44:40,419 --> 01:44:43,713
If you won't do it,
then forget it.

1238
01:45:36,015 --> 01:45:37,308
Thank you.

1239
01:45:40,436 --> 01:45:41,854
A math test.

1240
01:46:04,377 --> 01:46:06,545
I was impressed with you
for the first time.

1241
01:46:07,588 --> 01:46:09,005
You also look cute crying.

1242
01:46:09,006 --> 01:46:10,758
Just don't look at me.

1243
01:46:12,009 --> 01:46:13,886
I want to be one hell of a guy.

1244
01:46:30,778 --> 01:46:34,197
What can you learn
from violence?

1245
01:46:34,198 --> 01:46:36,283
I'm not doing it to learn.

1246
01:46:36,534 --> 01:46:38,035
You really are childish.

1247
01:46:49,088 --> 01:46:50,088
Idiot!

1248
01:46:51,841 --> 01:46:53,300
I know I am.

1249
01:46:53,592 --> 01:46:54,927
A real idiot!

1250
01:46:55,344 --> 01:46:57,054
You don't get it at all!

1251
01:46:57,221 --> 01:46:58,556
I sure don't!

1252
01:47:08,024 --> 01:47:09,066
Sorry.

1253
01:47:11,402 --> 01:47:12,862
I was too childish.

1254
01:47:34,008 --> 01:47:36,052
Mana Hayase!

1255
01:47:37,261 --> 01:47:40,514
I love you!

1256
01:47:41,766 --> 01:47:43,350
How do you feel about me?

1257
01:47:45,102 --> 01:47:46,312
You want to know?

1258
01:47:47,938 --> 01:47:51,650
I want Kosuke
to confess his love for me.

1259
01:47:51,859 --> 01:47:54,236
"I love you. Mana"

1260
01:48:03,120 --> 01:48:05,122
In that world, we're...

1261
01:48:08,209 --> 01:48:09,627
together as a couple.

1262
01:48:12,755 --> 01:48:17,426
Thank you
for falling in love with me.

1263
01:48:32,066 --> 01:48:33,275
Hey!

1264
01:48:45,121 --> 01:48:46,997
I'll always be childish.

1265
01:48:50,543 --> 01:48:51,836
Promise me.

1266
01:49:05,766 --> 01:49:13,566
"Congratulations
on your marriage"

1267
01:49:24,076 --> 01:49:28,080
Kosuke,
write a story about us next.

1268
01:49:29,373 --> 01:49:31,458
Then I'm the main character.

1269
01:49:31,834 --> 01:49:34,962
The biggest superhero
of the school.

1270
01:49:38,299 --> 01:49:42,595
I'm the guy with brains
but awkward with girls.

1271
01:49:43,220 --> 01:49:45,139
That'd be my character.

1272
01:49:47,099 --> 01:49:51,395
You better not write
about my private parts.

1273
01:49:53,189 --> 01:49:57,443
I'd be the paragon
of a good high school...

1274
01:50:00,487 --> 01:50:01,530
You got it.

1275
01:50:02,948 --> 01:50:05,451
I just thought of the title.

1276
01:50:08,329 --> 01:50:09,455
That's right.

1277
01:50:10,831 --> 01:50:15,836
I should write about the most
precious days of my life.

1278
01:50:16,962 --> 01:50:18,964
Mana gave me wings and

1279
01:50:19,798 --> 01:50:21,842
the wind that blows beneath them.

1280
01:50:30,517 --> 01:50:33,020
I've already decided the title.

1281
01:50:35,064 --> 01:50:38,191
"The back of the boy's shirt
was covered with dots".

1282
01:50:38,192 --> 01:50:39,651
"I turned around
and became captivated

1283
