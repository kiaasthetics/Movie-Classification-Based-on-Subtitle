1
00:00:39,915 --> 00:00:40,916
<i>Are we rolling?</i>

2
00:00:41,083 --> 00:00:42,459
<i>Okay, we're rolling.</i>

3
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:45,254
<i>Dave's birthday message,
take 1.</i>

4
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:46,964
<i>Happy Birthday, Dave!</i>

5
00:00:47,130 --> 00:00:49,508
<i>We know how hard you've been
working on Ashley's album...</i>

6
00:00:49,675 --> 00:00:50,926
<i>so we thought it would be fun</i>

7
00:00:51,009 --> 00:00:52,636
<i>to surprise you
with a little party.</i>

8
00:00:52,803 --> 00:00:56,014
<i>Hey! I thought you said this
was a going-away party for us.</i>

9
00:00:57,975 --> 00:00:58,976
Take 2.

10
00:00:59,142 --> 00:01:00,310
<i>To celebrate your birthday...</i>

11
00:01:00,477 --> 00:01:03,438
<i>and The Chipettes leaving to
guest-judge American Idol...</i>

12
00:01:03,605 --> 00:01:05,524
<i>we thought we'd throw you
a small get...</i>

13
00:01:05,774 --> 00:01:07,025
<i>Hold on, that's the DJ!</i>

14
00:01:07,192 --> 00:01:08,610
<i>Wait, "DJ"?</i>

15
00:01:09,027 --> 00:01:13,365
<i>Okay, fine, so it might be
a medium-sized get-together.</i>

16
00:01:13,657 --> 00:01:15,701
Alvin, did you
hire someone to build

17
00:01:15,826 --> 00:01:17,369
a half-pipe in the back yard?

18
00:01:17,619 --> 00:01:19,997
Of course not!
The party planner did.

19
00:01:20,163 --> 00:01:21,498
You hired a party planner?

20
00:01:21,665 --> 00:01:24,209
No, he did not hire
a "party planner."

21
00:01:24,376 --> 00:01:25,669
Thank goodness.
For a minute there, I...

22
00:01:25,836 --> 00:01:27,671
lam an event planner.

23
00:01:27,838 --> 00:01:29,673
Marco, I'm done
giving you instructions.

24
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:30,841
Boy.

25
00:01:31,133 --> 00:01:33,760
<i>Dave, it's all good.
It's just us.</i>

26
00:01:33,844 --> 00:01:35,637
<i>Nothing too cra...</i>

27
00:01:36,179 --> 00:01:38,390
<i>Theodore!
You hit the flip button!</i>

28
00:01:38,557 --> 00:01:40,517
<i>Oops! Um, hi.</i>

29
00:01:40,976 --> 00:01:44,313
So, the guest list got
a little out of hand.

30
00:01:44,688 --> 00:01:45,689
A little?

31
00:01:45,772 --> 00:01:47,065
<i>Dave, I had nothing
to do with this!</i>

32
00:01:47,190 --> 00:01:50,652
<i>Happy Birthday, Dave!
Whoo-hoo!</i>

33
00:01:50,736 --> 00:01:52,195
Redfoo is here?

34
00:01:52,362 --> 00:01:54,031
<i>Yeah, he is,
because I got him here.</i>

35
00:01:54,197 --> 00:01:57,576
<i>The Redfoo, from a little band
called The Foo Fighters.</i>

36
00:01:57,743 --> 00:01:58,744
<i>What?</i>

37
00:01:59,036 --> 00:02:01,079
<i>Well, there's no way
to sugarcoat it, Dave.</i>

38
00:02:01,204 --> 00:02:02,247
<i>The cops are here!...</i>

39
00:02:02,372 --> 00:02:03,582
<i>And they're having a blast!</i>

40
00:02:03,749 --> 00:02:04,791
<i>Happy Birthday, Dave!</i>

41
00:02:05,917 --> 00:02:07,461
This does wonders
for my glutes!

42
00:02:07,669 --> 00:02:09,421
This party is the least
we can do for you, Dave.

43
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:12,007
<i>Yeah! Giving up
songwriting to produce?</i>

44
00:02:12,090 --> 00:02:13,216
<i>Buying a new house?</i>

45
00:02:13,383 --> 00:02:15,385
<i>We know you've done
all of this for us.</i>

46
00:02:15,552 --> 00:02:17,054
<i>We love you, Dave!</i>

47
00:02:21,350 --> 00:02:22,851
<i>Happy Birthday, Dwayne.</i>

48
00:02:23,018 --> 00:02:24,728
<i>It's Dave!</i>

49
00:02:31,902 --> 00:02:34,821
I got 40 cheese pizzas here
for a, Theodore.

50
00:02:34,905 --> 00:02:37,115
Whoo-hoo! Pay the man, Si.

51
00:02:38,408 --> 00:02:39,451
Whoo!

52
00:02:40,410 --> 00:02:41,453
Redf00!

53
00:02:41,578 --> 00:02:44,081
You ready to rock this party
with a little <i>Party Rock?</i>

54
00:02:44,247 --> 00:02:45,666
You like the classics.

55
00:02:46,043 --> 00:02:50,256
<i>But</i> I <i>got</i> a <i>new one for you,
Juicy Wiggle!</i>

56
00:02:50,965 --> 00:02:52,633
This is my jizz-am!

57
00:02:55,469 --> 00:02:56,637
Ooh, cool!

58
00:03:25,958 --> 00:03:27,126
<i>a“ Juicy wiggle!</i>

59
00:03:35,092 --> 00:03:36,177
<i>MAN". 4' Get juicy</i>

60
00:03:46,979 --> 00:03:48,105
<i>ALL". 4' Get juicy</i>

61
00:03:52,443 --> 00:03:53,444
<i>r Get juicy!</i>

62
00:03:53,652 --> 00:03:55,196
<i>a' Two girls was shakin' it</i>

63
00:04:06,499 --> 00:04:08,501
Yeah! I'm in.

64
00:04:08,793 --> 00:04:10,127
Show 'em what you got, Theo!

65
00:04:18,385 --> 00:04:19,386
TH EODOREI Wh00-h00!

66
00:04:22,014 --> 00:04:23,682
He's so smooth.

67
00:04:25,142 --> 00:04:28,687
Whoo! Yeah!

68
00:04:28,979 --> 00:04:30,898
Whoo-whee!

69
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:35,361
Is that safe?

70
00:04:35,528 --> 00:04:37,822
No, it is absolutely not.

71
00:04:41,367 --> 00:04:42,535
What the...

72
00:04:43,536 --> 00:04:46,705
Um, excuse me, young lady?
The launch ramp is closed.

73
00:04:46,872 --> 00:04:48,374
Hey, Simon's gonna go!

74
00:04:49,166 --> 00:04:51,377
No, no, no, I'm not going.

75
00:04:51,502 --> 00:04:53,420
I was just explaining
that this is really...

76
00:04:53,546 --> 00:04:54,713
High!

77
00:04:59,093 --> 00:05:01,679
That was awesome!
I'm definitely going again.

78
00:05:03,097 --> 00:05:04,682
Boys.

79
00:05:06,058 --> 00:05:07,059
Whoo!

80
00:05:10,896 --> 00:05:13,190
When I say "Party,"
you say "Alvin!"

81
00:05:13,357 --> 00:05:15,234
- Party!
- Alvin!

82
00:05:15,401 --> 00:05:17,069
Party!
Alvin!

83
00:05:17,194 --> 00:05:18,154
Party!

84
00:05:18,237 --> 00:05:19,864
Alvin!

85
00:05:21,082 --> 00:05:22,083
Um...

86
00:05:22,250 --> 00:05:24,127
Surprise?

87
00:05:24,252 --> 00:05:25,253
Whoo-hoo!

88
00:05:27,422 --> 00:05:29,090
Boy.

89
00:05:30,592 --> 00:05:31,843
If anyone needs us,

90
00:05:31,926 --> 00:05:34,763
we'll just be...
Across the country.

91
00:05:35,638 --> 00:05:37,807
Over there, come on.
Party's over.

92
00:05:38,558 --> 00:05:40,477
Thank you.
Yeah, that's mine.

93
00:05:41,102 --> 00:05:42,062
You had to grab
one last one?

94
00:05:42,145 --> 00:05:43,146
Yeah.
Okay.

95
00:05:43,271 --> 00:05:45,273
Enjoy that, yeah.

96
00:05:45,607 --> 00:05:46,900
Were you surprised?

97
00:05:47,067 --> 00:05:49,778
No, I wasn't surprised,
and you wanna know why?

98
00:05:49,944 --> 00:05:53,156
Because #Davesparty
was trending on Twitter.

99
00:05:53,323 --> 00:05:54,407
Nice!

100
00:05:55,158 --> 00:05:56,618
I mean, sorry.

101
00:05:57,077 --> 00:05:58,495
I know my work schedule
istoughn.

102
00:05:58,661 --> 00:05:59,871
But I thought you guys
were old enough

103
00:05:59,954 --> 00:06:01,122
to take care of yourselves.

104
00:06:01,289 --> 00:06:02,665
But I guess you're
not mature enough for that.

105
00:06:02,832 --> 00:06:05,418
That's insulting.
We are very mature.

106
00:06:06,628 --> 00:06:09,464
Sorry. Pizza toots.

107
00:06:10,423 --> 00:06:12,425
Look, I'm trying to start
a new chapter in my life.

108
00:06:12,509 --> 00:06:13,843
A more stable chapter...

109
00:06:14,010 --> 00:06:15,220
where you guys
aren't performing

110
00:06:15,303 --> 00:06:16,846
in a different city
every night.

111
00:06:17,013 --> 00:06:18,515
But, we love to perform.

112
00:06:19,265 --> 00:06:21,309
You can go back to that,
just not now, okay?

113
00:06:21,476 --> 00:06:23,019
I want you guys
to have a few years

114
00:06:23,144 --> 00:06:24,145
of being normal kids.

115
00:06:24,646 --> 00:06:25,814
But we're not
normal kids, Dave.

116
00:06:25,939 --> 00:06:27,023
Yeah...

117
00:06:27,190 --> 00:06:29,692
we're multi-platinum singing
chipmunks! Oops.

118
00:06:29,818 --> 00:06:30,777
Well, right now,

119
00:06:30,860 --> 00:06:32,320
you're acting like
a bunch of animals...

120
00:06:32,487 --> 00:06:36,491
who just threw a giant house
party without my permission.

121
00:06:36,783 --> 00:06:39,494
Does this mean
no miniature golf tomorrow?

122
00:06:39,661 --> 00:06:41,204
It should, and normally,
it would.

123
00:06:41,371 --> 00:06:43,498
But, you're gonna give us
one last chance, right?

124
00:06:44,207 --> 00:06:48,002
I think he means
our 158th last chance?

125
00:06:48,169 --> 00:06:49,838
Look, selfishly,
I wanna spend as much time

126
00:06:49,963 --> 00:06:50,964
with you guys as I can...

127
00:06:51,131 --> 00:06:52,132
before I have to go to

128
00:06:52,215 --> 00:06:53,675
Ashley's album release
in Miami.

129
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:56,553
Whoo-hoo!
We're going to Miami!

130
00:07:03,059 --> 00:07:05,186
Theodore, get our Speedos!
Yeah!

131
00:07:05,562 --> 00:07:06,563
No, no Speedos.

132
00:07:06,688 --> 00:07:07,814
I'm going to Miami.

133
00:07:07,981 --> 00:07:09,065
I only got a plus one,

134
00:07:09,190 --> 00:07:11,067
so it wouldn't be fair
to pick favorites.

135
00:07:11,234 --> 00:07:12,277
Shh...

136
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:14,821
We both know
I'm your favorite.

137
00:07:14,988 --> 00:07:15,947
Alvin.

138
00:07:16,030 --> 00:07:17,365
Tied for favorite?

139
00:07:17,532 --> 00:07:19,367
You don't even have to
say with who.

140
00:07:19,534 --> 00:07:22,078
Blink once for Theodore,
twice for Simon.

141
00:07:22,912 --> 00:07:25,039
Got it, no favorites.

142
00:07:34,757 --> 00:07:36,885
Wind, 35 degrees,
out of the northwest.

143
00:07:37,385 --> 00:07:40,221
Okay, tail up.
10, 10 degrees down.

144
00:07:40,388 --> 00:07:41,556
Shoulders up, shoulders down.

145
00:07:41,723 --> 00:07:43,266
Shoulders to the left,
shoulders to the right.

146
00:07:43,391 --> 00:07:44,517
Tail in, tail out.

147
00:07:44,601 --> 00:07:45,643
While we're young, Simon.

148
00:07:45,727 --> 00:07:46,728
Loosen the grip,
loosen the grip.

149
00:07:46,853 --> 00:07:48,146
Not too loose,
not too loose, Simon.

150
00:07:48,229 --> 00:07:49,606
Any day, now.
And...

151
00:07:49,772 --> 00:07:50,940
my concentration is broken.

152
00:07:51,107 --> 00:07:53,026
Now I have to start all over.
Great!

153
00:07:53,109 --> 00:07:54,152
Let's start this
charade again.

154
00:07:54,235 --> 00:07:55,278
Come on!

155
00:07:55,403 --> 00:07:57,238
This isn't the PGA Tour,
Simon.

156
00:07:57,405 --> 00:08:00,241
Exactly. But this
is what it's all about.

157
00:08:00,408 --> 00:08:02,243
Just 4 dudes
playing some golf.

158
00:08:02,410 --> 00:08:04,078
Actually, that reminds me,...

159
00:08:04,245 --> 00:08:05,830
I invited a friend to join us.

160
00:08:05,914 --> 00:08:07,749
Is this
the famous Samantha

161
00:08:07,874 --> 00:08:09,167
we've been hearing
so much about?

162
00:08:09,542 --> 00:08:11,211
- It is.
- David!

163
00:08:11,377 --> 00:08:13,213
Ooh la la.

164
00:08:17,467 --> 00:08:18,927
Very funny, guys.

165
00:08:19,093 --> 00:08:21,763
Anyway, it's starting to feel
kind of serious, so...

166
00:08:21,930 --> 00:08:23,932
I thought an introduction
would be nice.

167
00:08:24,098 --> 00:08:26,100
You must really
like this girl, Dave.

168
00:08:26,267 --> 00:08:27,936
I do,
and I hope you guys do, too.

169
00:08:28,102 --> 00:08:31,523
Yeah. Any girlfriend of yours
is a girlfriend of ours.

170
00:08:32,607 --> 00:08:34,609
Thatsounded
way less weird in my head.

171
00:08:34,776 --> 00:08:36,277
You think?

172
00:08:36,736 --> 00:08:37,779
She's here.

173
00:08:38,279 --> 00:08:39,280
How do I look?

174
00:08:39,447 --> 00:08:40,782
Well...

175
00:08:41,115 --> 00:08:43,326
You know? Looks.

176
00:08:43,451 --> 00:08:45,453
Alvin! This is no time
for honesty.

177
00:08:45,662 --> 00:08:47,121
You look great,
Dave.

178
00:08:47,288 --> 00:08:50,291
That sweater makes you look
like a cozy grandpa.

179
00:08:50,583 --> 00:08:51,918
Thanks, Theodore.

180
00:08:52,627 --> 00:08:54,837
Okay, where was I?
Shoulders up, shoulders down.

181
00:08:55,004 --> 00:08:57,465
Brother.
Hit the ball, already!

182
00:08:57,632 --> 00:08:58,633
Okay!

183
00:08:59,509 --> 00:09:00,969
Look at it soar!

184
00:09:01,135 --> 00:09:02,637
Follow me, come on guys!

185
00:09:02,804 --> 00:09:03,805
WOW.

186
00:09:03,930 --> 00:09:04,889
Awesome!

187
00:09:04,973 --> 00:09:06,266
Come on!

188
00:09:07,183 --> 00:09:09,352
Follow the ball!
Through the mouth!

189
00:09:09,519 --> 00:09:11,020
Open wide!
Whoo-hoo!

190
00:09:11,479 --> 00:09:12,480
Hurry up!

191
00:09:13,815 --> 00:09:14,983
Hurry, Theodore!

192
00:09:15,149 --> 00:09:16,109
I'm going as fast as I can!

193
00:09:16,192 --> 00:09:17,235
Turn, turn!

194
00:09:17,318 --> 00:09:18,987
My wind calculations
were accurate!

195
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:20,321
Come On, guys!

196
00:09:20,488 --> 00:09:21,781
My gosh! My gosh!

197
00:09:22,115 --> 00:09:23,199
It's a hole-in...

198
00:09:23,366 --> 00:09:26,327
No! Why?

199
00:09:26,494 --> 00:09:28,454
Excuse me,
that's my brother's ball.

200
00:09:28,705 --> 00:09:30,498
This ball?

201
00:09:30,665 --> 00:09:31,874
No, no, this is my ball.

202
00:09:32,041 --> 00:09:33,835
What? I just hit
that beautiful shot.

203
00:09:34,002 --> 00:09:35,253
Tell you what,
let's compromise,

204
00:09:35,336 --> 00:09:37,839
and we'll call it...
no one's ball.

205
00:09:38,172 --> 00:09:39,173
Hey!

206
00:09:39,340 --> 00:09:40,341
I'm warning you.

207
00:09:40,466 --> 00:09:43,011
You mess with one of us,
you mess with all of us.

208
00:09:43,177 --> 00:09:44,220
Yeah!
Aw.

209
00:09:44,387 --> 00:09:45,638
I'm terrified.

210
00:09:47,515 --> 00:09:48,641
What, what? Ouch! Wait!

211
00:09:48,808 --> 00:09:49,851
What are you gonna do?

212
00:09:50,018 --> 00:09:53,146
We will continue this
conversation when I'm back.

213
00:09:53,646 --> 00:09:54,981
Hey, dude,
it's your turn.

214
00:09:55,064 --> 00:09:56,190
Yeah.

215
00:09:56,357 --> 00:09:58,151
Whatever!
I don't even need that ball!

216
00:09:58,693 --> 00:10:00,445
Si's right,
you're not worth it!

217
00:10:00,528 --> 00:10:01,654
Yeah!

218
00:10:02,864 --> 00:10:03,948
Dave,
thank goodness.

219
00:10:04,032 --> 00:10:05,033
Hey, Dave.

220
00:10:05,158 --> 00:10:07,243
Hey, guys. This is Samantha.

221
00:10:07,410 --> 00:10:09,329
Sam, these are my boys.
Hi.

222
00:10:09,495 --> 00:10:10,913
Hi.
That's Theodore.

223
00:10:11,039 --> 00:10:11,998
He might be the smallest,

224
00:10:12,081 --> 00:10:13,124
but he's got
the biggest heart.

225
00:10:13,207 --> 00:10:14,208
Hi.

226
00:10:14,334 --> 00:10:15,835
Ooh, we've heard
a lot about you.

227
00:10:17,045 --> 00:10:18,338
<i>Enchanté.</i>

228
00:10:19,589 --> 00:10:22,050
I can tell
that you're trouble.

229
00:10:22,216 --> 00:10:24,969
If by "trouble,"
you mean "irresistible,"

230
00:10:25,053 --> 00:10:26,679
then guilty as charged.

231
00:10:26,846 --> 00:10:29,265
Alvin, of course.
And there's Simon.

232
00:10:29,432 --> 00:10:30,475
So, you're a doctor?

233
00:10:30,558 --> 00:10:31,601
I am.

234
00:10:31,684 --> 00:10:32,685
Did Dave mention that?

235
00:10:32,769 --> 00:10:35,688
No, you're wearing
a stethoscope.

236
00:10:37,190 --> 00:10:39,567
Yes, I am.
That's embarrassing.

237
00:10:40,026 --> 00:10:41,611
Would it
be okay if I tried it?

238
00:10:41,736 --> 00:10:43,029
Yeah, knock yourself out.

239
00:10:43,196 --> 00:10:44,197
Thank you.

240
00:10:45,073 --> 00:10:48,242
Heart rate is smooth
and steady, 400 BPM.

241
00:10:48,409 --> 00:10:49,744
So, it's beating?

242
00:10:49,911 --> 00:10:51,245
Of course it's beating.

243
00:10:51,412 --> 00:10:53,414
It's so nice to finally
meet you guys.

244
00:10:53,581 --> 00:10:55,917
And this is my son, Miles.

245
00:10:56,250 --> 00:10:58,002
Son?
No.

246
00:10:58,086 --> 00:10:59,212
You guys have a lot in common.

247
00:10:59,295 --> 00:11:00,630
Miles is also a musician.

248
00:11:00,755 --> 00:11:01,964
Yeah, I've heard
you're pretty good.

249
00:11:02,090 --> 00:11:03,049
Thanks, Mr. Seville.

250
00:11:03,132 --> 00:11:04,300
Brother.

251
00:11:04,467 --> 00:11:05,593
We thought this
was the perfect place

252
00:11:05,718 --> 00:11:07,261
for you guys to get to know
each other better.

253
00:11:07,428 --> 00:11:09,430
Yes, so behave, okay?

254
00:11:09,597 --> 00:11:10,973
And Theo, get down from there.

255
00:11:11,099 --> 00:11:12,308
I'll get him.

256
00:11:13,434 --> 00:11:16,145
So, back to our conversation.

257
00:11:16,938 --> 00:11:18,147
No hard feelings?

258
00:11:19,899 --> 00:11:21,275
Hey, YOU guys having fun?

259
00:11:21,442 --> 00:11:23,444
Yeah, just
getting some cotton candy.

260
00:11:23,611 --> 00:11:24,737
All right.

261
00:11:26,989 --> 00:11:29,283
This is not my idea of fun.

262
00:11:30,660 --> 00:11:31,661
Yummy.

263
00:11:31,786 --> 00:11:32,787
Theo!

264
00:11:35,623 --> 00:11:37,083
Alvin,
where did Theodore go?

265
00:11:37,250 --> 00:11:39,585
I don't know, I haven't
seen him since the last hole.

266
00:11:39,752 --> 00:11:40,795
What do you think?

267
00:11:40,962 --> 00:11:43,339
20 bucks seems like
a lot of money for a chipmunk.

268
00:11:43,506 --> 00:11:44,757
He's a talking chipmunk.

269
00:11:44,924 --> 00:11:47,260
Go on, plump and juicy,
say something.

270
00:11:47,343 --> 00:11:48,928
Um, I also sing.

271
00:11:57,437 --> 00:11:58,521
This isn't like Theo,
to wander off.

272
00:11:58,646 --> 00:11:59,647
I know.

273
00:11:59,772 --> 00:12:01,065
Why don't you
check the river?

274
00:12:01,149 --> 00:12:02,150
Chip shot!

275
00:12:02,650 --> 00:12:03,651
Whoa!

276
00:12:04,986 --> 00:12:06,154
Alvin, I found him.

277
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:08,197
Give us back our brother!
Yeah!

278
00:12:08,364 --> 00:12:09,490
I just paid 20 bucks for him.

279
00:12:09,657 --> 00:12:10,825
He's not for sale!

280
00:12:11,534 --> 00:12:13,161
I want 40.
What?

281
00:12:13,327 --> 00:12:14,537
He's a talking chipmunk.

282
00:12:14,704 --> 00:12:15,705
I also sing.

283
00:12:15,872 --> 00:12:17,498
Theo! You're not helping.

284
00:12:29,343 --> 00:12:30,887
Fine!

285
00:12:32,138 --> 00:12:33,639
I hope you're happy,
Theodore.

286
00:12:33,723 --> 00:12:35,183
That was all of our allowance.

287
00:12:35,349 --> 00:12:37,435
Sorry.
I was born to perform.

288
00:12:37,518 --> 00:12:38,519
Great news, fellas.

289
00:12:38,644 --> 00:12:40,188
You get to hang
with Miles all day.

290
00:12:40,646 --> 00:12:42,690
And the hits
just keep on coming..

291
00:12:42,857 --> 00:12:44,317
Sam got a page
from the hospital,

292
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:46,319
so I'm going to take you four
to the studio with me.

293
00:12:46,486 --> 00:12:47,528
All right, be good.

294
00:12:47,695 --> 00:12:48,696
Bye, Mom.
Bye, honey.

295
00:12:48,821 --> 00:12:49,781
Don't forget your stethoscope.

296
00:12:49,864 --> 00:12:50,907
Yeah.

297
00:12:51,032 --> 00:12:51,991
You know what? Keep it.

298
00:12:52,074 --> 00:12:53,075
Thanks.

299
00:12:53,201 --> 00:12:54,202
Break a leg.

300
00:12:54,535 --> 00:12:57,205
That doesn't really apply
to doctors, Dave.

301
00:12:57,538 --> 00:12:58,498
Right.

302
00:12:58,581 --> 00:12:59,707
Good luck!

303
00:12:59,874 --> 00:13:02,001
You kind of hope your heart
surgeon doesn't need luck.

304
00:13:02,168 --> 00:13:03,878
... Have fun!

305
00:13:05,755 --> 00:13:06,923
Nailed it!

306
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:21,103
Look, paparazzi.

307
00:13:21,854 --> 00:13:23,731
I guess they heard
we were coming.

308
00:13:24,065 --> 00:13:27,735
Hey, guys!
It is good to see you.

309
00:13:27,944 --> 00:13:28,986
Can you get one more
from this side?

310
00:13:29,070 --> 00:13:30,238
Yeah.

311
00:13:30,404 --> 00:13:32,073
Guys, they aren't
here for you, come on.

312
00:13:32,573 --> 00:13:33,616
There she is! Ashley!

313
00:13:54,095 --> 00:13:55,888
Hey!
What the heck?

314
00:13:56,055 --> 00:13:57,807
Nice, Miles.
Yuck!

315
00:14:00,059 --> 00:14:01,102
No!
Hey!

316
00:14:02,603 --> 00:14:04,063
Hey, down here!

317
00:14:04,230 --> 00:14:05,273
Watch it, hey!

318
00:14:05,439 --> 00:14:06,899
- That's my tail!
- Excuse me.

319
00:14:07,066 --> 00:14:10,111
First, can you guys apologize
for trampling my friends?

320
00:14:11,612 --> 00:14:13,614
Aw, sorry about that, guys.

321
00:14:13,781 --> 00:14:14,907
Thank you, Ashley.
Sure.

322
00:14:14,991 --> 00:14:16,117
Miss Grey, when
are you going back on tour?

323
00:14:16,827 --> 00:14:17,828
Miss Grey, over here.

324
00:14:17,912 --> 00:14:18,871
Hey, you know what?

325
00:14:18,954 --> 00:14:20,247
Let me,
let me get this for you.

326
00:14:20,956 --> 00:14:23,334
You know,
I think it's "Push."

327
00:14:24,001 --> 00:14:25,795
Yeah,
you know, of course.

328
00:14:26,962 --> 00:14:28,631
Whoa. Okay.

329
00:14:30,132 --> 00:14:33,636
Looks like Mr. Macho isn't
as cool as he thinks he is.

330
00:14:39,517 --> 00:14:40,851
Man.

331
00:14:41,018 --> 00:14:42,937
I didn't realize
how boring it is

332
00:14:43,020 --> 00:14:44,647
to be on this side
of the glass.

333
00:14:45,523 --> 00:14:46,982
Yeah, why aren't
you guys in there?

334
00:14:47,149 --> 00:14:49,485
I thought you were, like,
super famous or something?

335
00:14:50,194 --> 00:14:52,613
One day, you're throwing back
pink lemonades

336
00:14:52,696 --> 00:14:54,323
on Diddy's yacht
in Saint-Tropez...

337
00:14:54,490 --> 00:14:55,699
Ooh, jackpot!

338
00:14:55,866 --> 00:14:57,868
...and the next,
you're eating stale chips

339
00:14:57,993 --> 00:14:59,203
you find in the couch.

340
00:14:59,370 --> 00:15:01,038
I miss it.

341
00:15:01,163 --> 00:15:04,542
... Theodore, couch
chips are for talent only.

342
00:15:05,960 --> 00:15:07,127
Really, Barry?

343
00:15:07,670 --> 00:15:10,339
All right, you can keep it.
Just don't tell anyone, okay?

344
00:15:10,548 --> 00:15:12,007
Whoo-hoo! Yum.

345
00:15:14,678 --> 00:15:15,679
<i>We did it!</i>

346
00:15:15,804 --> 00:15:18,139
We successfully introduced
our kids to each other.

347
00:15:18,306 --> 00:15:20,350
And then, you performed
open-heart surgery.

348
00:15:20,517 --> 00:15:21,935
Please, after being
a single mom

349
00:15:22,018 --> 00:15:23,728
and a med student,
I could do this in my sleep.

350
00:15:25,313 --> 00:15:27,524
And I wore my stethoscope
out again, didn't I?

351
00:15:28,066 --> 00:15:29,484
I thought it was cute.

352
00:15:29,651 --> 00:15:32,237
And I like people to know
I'm dating a doctor.

353
00:15:33,905 --> 00:15:35,240
All right, I guess my life

354
00:15:35,365 --> 00:15:37,534
is a little more hectic
than I'd like to admit.

355
00:15:37,701 --> 00:15:38,702
I get it.

356
00:15:39,536 --> 00:15:42,247
So, I have to ask. The boys?

357
00:15:42,414 --> 00:15:44,666
Are they, like,
your adopted kids, or...

358
00:15:44,833 --> 00:15:45,834
How does that work?

359
00:15:46,001 --> 00:15:48,253
I don't know, I never really
thought about it.

360
00:15:50,755 --> 00:15:51,840
What?

361
00:15:53,675 --> 00:15:55,218
They're lucky to have you.

362
00:15:58,346 --> 00:15:59,347
Crazy idea.

363
00:16:00,724 --> 00:16:02,225
Have you ever been to Miami?

364
00:16:05,103 --> 00:16:07,772
<i>This is</i> American Idol!

365
00:16:09,399 --> 00:16:11,234
<i>I'm sorry
to have to do this...</i>

366
00:16:11,568 --> 00:16:13,570
<i>but you're going to Hollywood!</i>

367
00:16:14,904 --> 00:16:18,199
I've always
wanted to say that!

368
00:16:18,366 --> 00:16:21,077
Why did they get to move out
and do all this cool stuff?

369
00:16:21,244 --> 00:16:22,412
Well, Alvin...

370
00:16:22,579 --> 00:16:24,331
girls are
scientifically proven

371
00:16:24,414 --> 00:16:25,915
to mature faster than boys.

372
00:16:26,082 --> 00:16:27,250
Whatever.

373
00:16:27,792 --> 00:16:28,793
Hey, guys.

374
00:16:28,918 --> 00:16:29,878
- Dave!
- Hi.

375
00:16:29,961 --> 00:16:31,296
Sorry I'm late.
I had to pick up

376
00:16:31,421 --> 00:16:32,422
a few things on the way home.

377
00:16:32,547 --> 00:16:34,466
No worries,
we've just been ruminating

378
00:16:34,591 --> 00:16:36,092
on why we still live at home.

379
00:16:36,259 --> 00:16:37,761
So, what'd you guys
think of Samantha?

380
00:16:37,927 --> 00:16:38,970
She's awesome.

381
00:16:39,137 --> 00:16:40,180
We loved her.

382
00:16:40,513 --> 00:16:42,599
Ooh, leftovers.

383
00:16:46,061 --> 00:16:47,729
Ooh, I can't wait.

384
00:16:47,896 --> 00:16:50,982
I can taste it.
Yes! Yummy.

385
00:16:51,566 --> 00:16:53,943
I can't eat this.

386
00:16:54,110 --> 00:16:57,072
Whoa! That is a serious
engagement ring.

387
00:16:57,405 --> 00:16:59,949
Wait a second. That means
Dave is going to ask

388
00:17:00,075 --> 00:17:01,826
Samantha to marry him.

389
00:17:01,993 --> 00:17:03,787
Hold on, we don't know that.

390
00:17:03,953 --> 00:17:05,622
They've only been together
a few months,

391
00:17:05,747 --> 00:17:07,457
so you're probably
overreacting.

392
00:17:07,624 --> 00:17:08,625
But what if it's true?

393
00:17:09,959 --> 00:17:11,169
Here he comes.

394
00:17:11,336 --> 00:17:12,337
Act casual.

395
00:17:15,924 --> 00:17:17,342
What are you guys doing?

396
00:17:18,802 --> 00:17:21,096
Yoga. Downward munk?

397
00:17:21,262 --> 00:17:22,222
Well, that's great
to hear that

398
00:17:22,305 --> 00:17:23,973
you guys like Samantha,
because“.

399
00:17:24,140 --> 00:17:25,975
She's gonna become
a big part of my life.

400
00:17:26,434 --> 00:17:27,519
And good news.

401
00:17:27,644 --> 00:17:29,479
My plus one
isn't going to waste.

402
00:17:29,813 --> 00:17:31,523
She is coming
to Miami with me.

403
00:17:34,692 --> 00:17:37,987
I'm standing right here.
I can hear what he's saying.

404
00:17:48,581 --> 00:17:50,250
I've always wanted a mom.

405
00:17:50,333 --> 00:17:51,334
Guys...

406
00:17:51,418 --> 00:17:55,004
...if Samantha is our mom,
that makes Miles...

407
00:17:55,171 --> 00:17:56,256
Our brother.

408
00:17:59,509 --> 00:18:01,010
No!

409
00:18:01,845 --> 00:18:03,847
Deep breaths, Theodore.
In and out.

410
00:18:04,013 --> 00:18:05,557
It's going to be okay.

411
00:18:05,723 --> 00:18:07,267
What are we gonna do?

412
00:18:08,351 --> 00:18:09,519
Guys, it's time.

413
00:18:09,853 --> 00:18:12,564
Operation ring retrieval
is a go.

414
00:18:12,730 --> 00:18:14,691
No ring, no proposal.

415
00:18:14,858 --> 00:18:17,068
No proposal, no Miles.

416
00:18:17,235 --> 00:18:18,736
Theo, fall in line, soldier.

417
00:18:18,903 --> 00:18:20,363
Brother.

418
00:18:31,124 --> 00:18:33,418
Alvin, what...
Are we doing a charade?

419
00:18:34,794 --> 00:18:36,421
Cool. Two words.

420
00:18:36,588 --> 00:18:38,047
No.

421
00:18:38,715 --> 00:18:40,216
First down? What are you...

422
00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:42,594
Two syllables. Sounds like.

423
00:18:42,760 --> 00:18:43,887
Is it a movie? First word.

424
00:18:44,053 --> 00:18:45,054
A song?

425
00:18:45,221 --> 00:18:46,222
Angry.
Get over here.

426
00:18:46,389 --> 00:18:47,390
Okay.

427
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:49,267
Still no idea
what you're saying.

428
00:18:49,893 --> 00:18:51,102
Theodore, you keep
an eye on Dave.

429
00:18:51,227 --> 00:18:53,104
Simon and I will get the ring.

430
00:19:01,237 --> 00:19:03,072
There you are.

431
00:19:03,781 --> 00:19:05,158
Alvin, grab this.

432
00:19:13,917 --> 00:19:15,251
Let's do this.

433
00:19:24,511 --> 00:19:25,512
Yes!

434
00:19:25,678 --> 00:19:27,430
The bag's gone.
No.

435
00:19:27,597 --> 00:19:29,474
You mean that bag over there?

436
00:19:30,266 --> 00:19:31,434
And I'm back to "Yes."

437
00:19:32,644 --> 00:19:33,645
And right back to "No."

438
00:19:33,770 --> 00:19:35,438
Abort. Abort. Let's go.

439
00:19:39,943 --> 00:19:40,985
Guys...

440
00:19:41,653 --> 00:19:43,196
what are you doing in here?

441
00:19:43,947 --> 00:19:45,949
... Well... We...

442
00:19:46,115 --> 00:19:48,326
just wanted to spend
as much time as possible

443
00:19:48,451 --> 00:19:50,537
with you before
you left for Miami.

444
00:19:50,703 --> 00:19:51,788
Yeah.

445
00:19:51,955 --> 00:19:53,623
All right.
I'll make breakfast.

446
00:19:53,790 --> 00:19:55,833
Whoo-hoo! I love breakfast.

447
00:19:56,125 --> 00:19:57,460
Alvin, grab it.

448
00:19:57,794 --> 00:20:01,506
Ooh, ooh, Belgian waffles,
pancakes. So excited.

449
00:20:12,850 --> 00:20:13,851
Okay, guys--

450
00:20:14,018 --> 00:20:16,479
Miss Price from next door,
she's gonna peek in on you...

451
00:20:16,646 --> 00:20:17,814
make sure you're all right.

452
00:20:17,981 --> 00:20:19,482
What? She's nuts.

453
00:20:19,649 --> 00:20:21,901
We should be the ones
checking in on her.

454
00:20:22,068 --> 00:20:23,820
Well, after that big party
you guys threw...

455
00:20:23,987 --> 00:20:25,530
I don't feel very comfortable
with you guys

456
00:20:25,655 --> 00:20:27,448
staying here unsupervised.
You got it?

457
00:20:28,658 --> 00:20:29,993
That must be
Samantha and Miles.

458
00:20:31,244 --> 00:20:32,328
Miles?

459
00:20:32,495 --> 00:20:34,330
Yeah, he's going to stay
with you guys for a few days.

460
00:20:34,497 --> 00:20:36,958
So, you don't feel comfortable
leaving us alone,

461
00:20:37,041 --> 00:20:40,253
but you're okay leaving us
with that psychopath?

462
00:20:40,420 --> 00:20:41,754
No, he's a great kid.

463
00:20:41,921 --> 00:20:42,922
It'll be fun.

464
00:20:43,089 --> 00:20:44,299
You know, it'll be,

465
00:20:44,382 --> 00:20:46,342
a good bonding experience
for you guys.

466
00:20:46,509 --> 00:20:48,761
I'm pretty sure
Miles would interpret

467
00:20:48,845 --> 00:20:51,681
"bonding experience"
as super-gluing us together.

468
00:20:52,265 --> 00:20:53,433
Hi.

469
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:54,726
Wow. Great place.

470
00:20:54,892 --> 00:20:56,060
Thanks.

471
00:20:56,227 --> 00:20:57,437
Make yourself at home.

472
00:20:57,604 --> 00:20:59,188
<i>Mi</i> casa, su casa.

473
00:20:59,355 --> 00:21:03,067
Thank you, David, that's very
generous of you to open your home.

474
00:21:03,359 --> 00:21:05,403
Wow. That's really impressive.

475
00:21:05,862 --> 00:21:07,196
I actually don't
speak Spanish.

476
00:21:07,363 --> 00:21:08,531
He said that it's
very generous

477
00:21:08,615 --> 00:21:10,033
of you to open your home.

478
00:21:10,450 --> 00:21:12,493
I also speak Spanish.

479
00:21:12,660 --> 00:21:14,954
And you're not fooling anyone
with your good boy routine.

480
00:21:15,204 --> 00:21:17,040
I'm fooling everyone.

481
00:21:17,165 --> 00:21:21,544
They have no idea that I'm going
to make you my personal servant.

482
00:21:22,754 --> 00:21:25,381
All right. I guess this is it.
Have a great weekend, guys.

483
00:21:25,548 --> 00:21:26,549
And boys...

484
00:21:26,633 --> 00:21:28,885
try to show me you can handle
some independence, okay?

485
00:21:28,968 --> 00:21:30,011
All right, bye, sweetie.
Be good.

486
00:21:30,094 --> 00:21:31,220
Okay.

487
00:21:32,221 --> 00:21:33,973
All right. Here we go.

488
00:21:34,140 --> 00:21:35,975
I can feel the bonding
happening already.

489
00:21:37,226 --> 00:21:39,812
We're gonna be doing
tons of bonding.

490
00:21:41,564 --> 00:21:43,107
Where's the Super Glue?

491
00:21:46,277 --> 00:21:48,237
Miles, if we're going
to make this work,

492
00:21:48,321 --> 00:21:49,614
we need to talk.

493
00:21:49,781 --> 00:21:50,990
Feels like it's working.

494
00:21:51,157 --> 00:21:52,575
But, good talk.

495
00:21:52,742 --> 00:21:54,744
You can't shut us out forever.

496
00:21:54,911 --> 00:21:56,245
He means emotionally, but...

497
00:21:56,412 --> 00:21:57,830
I want to focus
on the physically

498
00:21:57,914 --> 00:21:59,582
shutting us out
of our own home part.

499
00:21:59,749 --> 00:22:01,000
I have to pee.

500
00:22:01,084 --> 00:22:02,168
You guys are so naive.

501
00:22:02,293 --> 00:22:04,420
Trust me, this thing with
Dave and my mom is temporary.

502
00:22:04,587 --> 00:22:07,590
If by temporary you mean,
"till death do they part"...

503
00:22:07,757 --> 00:22:09,342
then yeah. Totally temporary.

504
00:22:09,801 --> 00:22:10,843
What are you talking about?

505
00:22:11,010 --> 00:22:12,970
He's talking
about marriage, Miles.

506
00:22:13,096 --> 00:22:14,305
Wedding bells.

507
00:22:14,430 --> 00:22:17,517
Dave liked it and he's
gonna put a ring on it.

508
00:22:20,853 --> 00:22:21,979
A bag of tissue.

509
00:22:22,146 --> 00:22:23,606
What?
Scandalous.

510
00:22:23,773 --> 00:22:24,816
It's gone.

511
00:22:24,982 --> 00:22:26,359
He must have
packed the ring

512
00:22:26,442 --> 00:22:27,777
last night before bed.

513
00:22:27,860 --> 00:22:30,113
He's going to
propose to Samantha in Miami.

514
00:22:30,279 --> 00:22:31,614
So you think we're
all gonna become, like,

515
00:22:31,698 --> 00:22:33,199
one big happy family?

516
00:22:33,366 --> 00:22:35,368
No one said happy.
No offense to your mom.

517
00:22:35,451 --> 00:22:36,911
She actually seems
quite wonderful.

518
00:22:36,994 --> 00:22:39,288
Yeah. It's you
we're not thrilled about.

519
00:22:39,455 --> 00:22:40,665
Well, the feeling is mutual.

520
00:22:40,832 --> 00:22:42,709
And you guys
can keep Dave too.

521
00:22:42,875 --> 00:22:43,876
My dad died when I was little

522
00:22:43,960 --> 00:22:45,294
and I've done
just fine without one.

523
00:22:45,670 --> 00:22:48,214
I'm sorry, Miles.

524
00:22:48,631 --> 00:22:50,299
Don't be. I didn't know him.

525
00:22:50,842 --> 00:22:52,385
If Dave and my mom
do get married...

526
00:22:52,468 --> 00:22:53,469
they'll wanna have
their own kids.

527
00:22:53,553 --> 00:22:55,221
And you're not even
Dave's real sons...

528
00:22:55,304 --> 00:22:56,389
you'rejust a bunch
of chipmunks

529
00:22:56,472 --> 00:22:57,557
that he calls his kids.

530
00:22:57,640 --> 00:22:58,641
Before you guys know it,

531
00:22:58,725 --> 00:23:00,059
you'll be back
out in the forest.

532
00:23:00,309 --> 00:23:02,186
Holding your nuts all winter.

533
00:23:02,311 --> 00:23:03,271
Hey.

534
00:23:03,354 --> 00:23:04,981
First of all,
that's what squirrels do.

535
00:23:05,064 --> 00:23:06,482
We are chipmunks.

536
00:23:07,650 --> 00:23:09,026
Um, Alvin,
chipmunks do that too.

537
00:23:09,193 --> 00:23:10,987
And the fact that
I didn't know that...

538
00:23:11,154 --> 00:23:14,240
is exactly why we cannot
end up back in the forest.

539
00:23:15,324 --> 00:23:16,993
But... Dave wouldn't
do that to us.

540
00:23:17,076 --> 00:23:18,077
He already has.

541
00:23:18,494 --> 00:23:20,747
Why do you think you guys are
here and my mom's in Miami?

542
00:23:21,205 --> 00:23:22,707
Meeting of the Munks.

543
00:23:22,874 --> 00:23:25,710
I don't want Miles to be right
any more than you do,

544
00:23:25,835 --> 00:23:27,336
but it all kind of lines up.

545
00:23:27,503 --> 00:23:31,591
Newjob, new house,
new girlfriend, new family.

546
00:23:31,758 --> 00:23:33,676
I don't want to go back
to the forest.

547
00:23:33,843 --> 00:23:37,638
And I am definitely not going
to end up related to that guy.

548
00:23:39,682 --> 00:23:41,267
Nice form.

549
00:23:41,768 --> 00:23:42,894
Here's the deal, Miles.

550
00:23:43,060 --> 00:23:45,438
We all go to Miami
to stop this proposal...

551
00:23:45,605 --> 00:23:48,608
and then we never have to
see each other again.

552
00:23:48,900 --> 00:23:49,942
I'm in.

553
00:23:50,109 --> 00:23:51,861
Can't get you chipmunks
out of my life fast enough.

554
00:23:52,028 --> 00:23:53,821
That's the smartest thing
you've said

555
00:23:53,905 --> 00:23:55,281
since we met you.

556
00:23:56,032 --> 00:23:57,074
Are you sure there's

557
00:23:57,200 --> 00:23:58,201
enough money
in your piggy bank?

558
00:23:58,284 --> 00:23:59,786
Guys, it's a credit card.

559
00:23:59,869 --> 00:24:01,621
We'll get 4 tickets.
Stop worrying.

560
00:24:01,788 --> 00:24:03,080
Hello, boys.

561
00:24:03,247 --> 00:24:04,373
Hey, Miss Price.

562
00:24:04,540 --> 00:24:06,709
I'm supposed to be
keeping an eye on you...

563
00:24:07,210 --> 00:24:09,086
so I think I'll use...

564
00:24:09,545 --> 00:24:10,713
this one.

565
00:24:17,970 --> 00:24:20,056
How are we gonna get to Miami
if she's gonna be watching us?

566
00:24:20,223 --> 00:24:22,975
Guys, I have a plan.

567
00:24:23,267 --> 00:24:26,312
The 4 words
society fears most.

568
00:24:27,230 --> 00:24:28,731
I can't believe that worked.

569
00:24:28,898 --> 00:24:30,316
It wasn't so much me

570
00:24:30,399 --> 00:24:32,944
as it was the peanuts
dipped in cough syrup.

571
00:24:36,489 --> 00:24:37,782
That's really messed up.

572
00:24:38,825 --> 00:24:40,409
Respect.
Thank you!

573
00:24:40,743 --> 00:24:42,578
Alvin, these aren't
even chipmunks.

574
00:24:42,745 --> 00:24:43,746
They're squirrels.

575
00:24:43,913 --> 00:24:45,331
Beggars
can't be choosers.

576
00:24:45,665 --> 00:24:47,708
Besides, once we put them
in the shirts

577
00:24:47,792 --> 00:24:49,669
from the Alvin, Simon
and Theodore dolls...

578
00:24:49,836 --> 00:24:52,505
Miss Price won't be able to
tell the difference.

579
00:24:52,922 --> 00:24:54,173
Yeah, let's do it.

580
00:24:54,298 --> 00:24:56,592
Ooh... I get to change me!

581
00:25:01,430 --> 00:25:02,390
I can't believe
I maxed out my mom's

582
00:25:02,473 --> 00:25:03,766
entire card
in this one ticket.

583
00:25:03,933 --> 00:25:06,102
We're fine.
Just stick to the plan.

584
00:25:06,269 --> 00:25:09,272
I'm starting to think I should
go through cargo with Theo.

585
00:25:09,355 --> 00:25:10,356
Shh.

586
00:25:10,523 --> 00:25:12,149
Be silent. Be still.

587
00:25:12,775 --> 00:25:14,360
And you. Get in there.

588
00:25:14,527 --> 00:25:15,528
Easy!

589
00:25:15,695 --> 00:25:16,737
- Both of you guys.
- Watch the zipper.

590
00:25:16,821 --> 00:25:17,822
Next!

591
00:25:17,947 --> 00:25:19,782
Who knows what
you're carrying in this thing.

592
00:25:30,626 --> 00:25:31,794
Go on through.

593
00:25:36,465 --> 00:25:37,508
Whoa!

594
00:25:38,301 --> 00:25:39,468
What's that?

595
00:25:39,969 --> 00:25:43,639
That is a...
stuffed Alvin doll.

596
00:25:43,806 --> 00:25:47,351
You know, from that lame
singing chipmunks group.

597
00:25:48,144 --> 00:25:49,312
Um, yeah.

598
00:25:49,687 --> 00:25:51,647
I'm gonna need to see what's
in that backpack, please.

599
00:25:51,814 --> 00:25:52,815
No.

600
00:25:53,149 --> 00:25:54,650
Yeah.

601
00:25:56,861 --> 00:25:58,154
Um, it's just a doll.

602
00:25:58,321 --> 00:25:59,655
Chucky was just a doll.

603
00:26:02,658 --> 00:26:04,493
This is Alvin.
It's what the "A" is for.

604
00:26:05,703 --> 00:26:08,331
He does a lot of bending
and back up.

605
00:26:08,998 --> 00:26:10,374
He does splits.

606
00:26:12,335 --> 00:26:14,003
He can twist.

607
00:26:14,837 --> 00:26:18,341
Like Linda Blair almost.

608
00:26:18,549 --> 00:26:21,260
You can use it
as a weight-loss device.

609
00:26:23,429 --> 00:26:24,430
I can feel the sweat.

610
00:26:25,806 --> 00:26:27,558
It even talks.

611
00:26:27,725 --> 00:26:31,520
It says,
"I'm a dumb stupid-head."

612
00:26:36,359 --> 00:26:39,528
Sorry, the batteries
might be a bit low.

613
00:26:39,695 --> 00:26:41,447
I'm a dumb stupid-head!

614
00:26:42,782 --> 00:26:43,908
So, he's...!

615
00:26:45,034 --> 00:26:46,243
And it bites.

616
00:26:46,410 --> 00:26:47,912
I think that was just
a design flaw.

617
00:26:48,037 --> 00:26:49,455
There's probably a recall.

618
00:26:50,957 --> 00:26:52,375
You can put the doll
back in the bag.

619
00:26:53,876 --> 00:26:54,919
Not the dark place!

620
00:26:55,086 --> 00:26:56,087
What I am gonna need...

621
00:26:56,253 --> 00:26:58,297
is for you to take a step
right over there...

622
00:26:58,464 --> 00:27:01,717
because we're gonna need to
do a quick body search.

623
00:27:02,885 --> 00:27:03,928
Body search?

624
00:27:04,095 --> 00:27:05,137
Body search!

625
00:27:07,139 --> 00:27:08,766
Good luck, Simon!
Yeah.

626
00:27:10,476 --> 00:27:11,477
Okay.

627
00:27:12,144 --> 00:27:13,729
No.

628
00:27:13,896 --> 00:27:15,398
Where to hide, where to hide?

629
00:27:16,732 --> 00:27:17,733
Relax.

630
00:27:17,900 --> 00:27:19,443
Put your arms out.
They're out.

631
00:27:24,740 --> 00:27:26,117
One last spot to get.

632
00:27:26,200 --> 00:27:27,243
I don't wanna
go to jail.

633
00:27:27,326 --> 00:27:28,744
I don't wanna go to jail!

634
00:27:38,421 --> 00:27:39,672
That's not mine.

635
00:27:39,922 --> 00:27:41,507
You just holding it
for a friend?

636
00:27:42,133 --> 00:27:44,010
No, no,
not that, not that.

637
00:27:52,351 --> 00:27:54,103
I don't get paid enough.

638
00:27:54,270 --> 00:27:55,271
Get out of here.

639
00:27:55,855 --> 00:27:57,023
<i>Real smooth, Simon.</i>

640
00:27:57,398 --> 00:27:59,608
I'm sorry!
I just, I got so nervous.

641
00:27:59,692 --> 00:28:00,735
You are lucky I don't flush

642
00:28:00,818 --> 00:28:01,986
the both of you
down the toilet!

643
00:28:02,111 --> 00:28:04,030
Well, I'm glad we sent
Theodore to Baggage.

644
00:28:04,321 --> 00:28:06,615
He never would have
made it through Security.

645
00:28:07,033 --> 00:28:09,618
Wow! Hi, everyone!

646
00:28:10,119 --> 00:28:11,996
Cold in here, isn't it?

647
00:28:13,873 --> 00:28:16,834
Whoa!

648
00:28:20,129 --> 00:28:21,922
Miles, will you ask
a flight attendant

649
00:28:22,006 --> 00:28:23,466
for some peanuts?
We're hungry.

650
00:28:23,632 --> 00:28:25,342
Yeah. I too would
love a water.

651
00:28:25,509 --> 00:28:27,553
But no ice.
It's supposed to be filthy.

652
00:28:27,636 --> 00:28:28,637
Ooh, which reminds me.

653
00:28:28,721 --> 00:28:29,722
Germs,
germs, go away,

654
00:28:29,805 --> 00:28:31,098
don't come back
any other day, okay.

655
00:28:31,265 --> 00:28:32,975
Shut up and stay out of sight.

656
00:28:33,142 --> 00:28:34,185
Hey! Easy!

657
00:28:34,351 --> 00:28:35,436
It smells in here.

658
00:28:35,603 --> 00:28:38,355
If you're not gonna feed us,
I'm going to forage.

659
00:28:38,522 --> 00:28:39,857
Not a great idea, Alvin.

660
00:28:40,066 --> 00:28:41,817
We're not legitimate
passengers!

661
00:28:45,654 --> 00:28:47,198
Oops! Sorry!

662
00:28:48,866 --> 00:28:50,367
I didn't mean to startle you.

663
00:28:50,534 --> 00:28:52,661
I'm not startled.

664
00:28:52,995 --> 00:28:54,330
It's just you're...

665
00:28:54,497 --> 00:28:55,498
You're you.

666
00:28:55,664 --> 00:28:56,832
I am me.

667
00:28:56,999 --> 00:28:59,001
And, you know,
if you have a pen...

668
00:28:59,168 --> 00:29:01,796
I'm always happy to
sign an autograph for a fan.

669
00:29:04,048 --> 00:29:05,508
I'm not a fan.

670
00:29:05,674 --> 00:29:07,927
Okay.

671
00:29:09,762 --> 00:29:12,515
Well, um, I'll be seeing you.

672
00:29:13,265 --> 00:29:15,726
Excuse me! Pardon me!
Coming through.

673
00:29:15,893 --> 00:29:19,730
Now where in this tin can
can I get some snacks?

674
00:29:30,950 --> 00:29:32,868
On, baby!

675
00:29:38,332 --> 00:29:39,917
Hi! I'm Theodore.

676
00:29:40,417 --> 00:29:41,585
Shh.

677
00:29:41,710 --> 00:29:43,254
Inside voice.

678
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:45,965
Please stop.

679
00:29:46,132 --> 00:29:48,384
You're gonna make
the other animals nervous!

680
00:29:54,390 --> 00:29:56,225
Okay, I'll let you out.

681
00:29:56,392 --> 00:29:58,727
But you have to promise
to go back in before we land.

682
00:30:02,231 --> 00:30:03,983
Got it. There you go!

683
00:30:04,316 --> 00:30:06,569
Thank you, friend.

684
00:30:12,116 --> 00:30:13,117
Hey!

685
00:30:13,993 --> 00:30:15,953
Please, everyone relax!

686
00:30:16,245 --> 00:30:18,455
Um, Mister Monkey? Wha...

687
00:30:18,622 --> 00:30:20,082
Wait! Don't do that.

688
00:30:20,916 --> 00:30:22,501
No. Bad monkey!

689
00:30:23,794 --> 00:30:24,837
I asked you to stop!

690
00:30:24,920 --> 00:30:26,338
Hey! Please!

691
00:30:26,589 --> 00:30:28,174
I'm begging you, Monkey Man!

692
00:30:38,100 --> 00:30:39,101
What?

693
00:30:39,185 --> 00:30:41,395
You've never seen a chipmunk
in first class before?

694
00:30:41,478 --> 00:30:44,315
Actually, I recently flew
next to The Chipettes

695
00:30:44,440 --> 00:30:45,774
and they were ladies.

696
00:30:45,983 --> 00:30:48,861
<i>Hey. Don't judge me.</i>
I <i>saw Pink Flamingos.</i>

697
00:30:49,028 --> 00:30:51,113
Excuse me.
May I see your boarding pass?

698
00:30:51,280 --> 00:30:54,783
Yeah, well,
funny thing about that.

699
00:30:54,950 --> 00:30:56,160
Ha! Gotta run!

700
00:30:56,285 --> 00:30:57,286
Come here.

701
00:30:59,872 --> 00:31:01,040
Get back here!

702
00:31:03,375 --> 00:31:04,460
Simon! Run!

703
00:31:04,627 --> 00:31:05,669
Where? We're on a plane.

704
00:31:05,836 --> 00:31:07,463
I don't know! Come on.

705
00:31:09,381 --> 00:31:10,466
Freeze!

706
00:31:11,467 --> 00:31:12,968
Air marshal.

707
00:31:13,135 --> 00:31:14,637
Don't move.

708
00:31:16,013 --> 00:31:17,556
Can we move now?

709
00:31:17,890 --> 00:31:20,851
This is a very
hard pose to hold.

710
00:31:22,478 --> 00:31:23,479
What's that?

711
00:31:26,148 --> 00:31:27,983
This can't be good.

712
00:31:30,903 --> 00:31:31,987
What the...

713
00:31:33,489 --> 00:31:34,657
What? What?

714
00:31:35,241 --> 00:31:36,951
All right!
Everybody calm down!

715
00:31:37,034 --> 00:31:39,203
It's just a monkey. All right?

716
00:31:39,370 --> 00:31:40,913
Birds! Birds!

717
00:31:43,040 --> 00:31:45,709
Help! Someone save me!

718
00:31:45,876 --> 00:31:47,169
Nice doggy...

719
00:31:48,170 --> 00:31:49,546
Theo! Over here! Jump!

720
00:31:50,547 --> 00:31:52,049
Birds and dogs!

721
00:31:52,383 --> 00:31:53,842
My God!

722
00:31:54,260 --> 00:31:55,552
Okay, now there's a goat.

723
00:31:56,762 --> 00:31:59,014
And an otter.
And an otter! God!

724
00:31:59,181 --> 00:32:01,308
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
this is your captain speaking.</i>

725
00:32:01,392 --> 00:32:02,393
Listen!

726
00:32:02,518 --> 00:32:03,519
<i>We're going to be making an...</i>

727
00:32:03,602 --> 00:32:05,562
<i>emergency landing
in Austin, Texas</i>

728
00:32:05,688 --> 00:32:07,690
<i>due to a herd of
chinchillas in the cockpit.</i>

729
00:32:07,773 --> 00:32:08,774
All right, you heard him!

730
00:32:08,941 --> 00:32:10,401
The plane's going down.

731
00:32:12,736 --> 00:32:14,863
Not down like down-down.

732
00:32:14,947 --> 00:32:17,741
Safely-safely.
We're not crashing!

733
00:32:18,742 --> 00:32:19,910
You people are idiots!

734
00:32:20,077 --> 00:32:21,287
We're all gonna die!

735
00:32:21,453 --> 00:32:22,454
What an idiot!

736
00:32:22,621 --> 00:32:24,540
Great speech, Churchill.

737
00:32:24,707 --> 00:32:26,292
You better watch it!

738
00:32:26,458 --> 00:32:27,835
Do you know who
you're talking to?

739
00:32:27,918 --> 00:32:29,920
I am the police of the sky!

740
00:32:33,257 --> 00:32:34,383
Really?

741
00:32:36,927 --> 00:32:37,970
<i>Okay.
Let's make sure</i>

742
00:32:38,053 --> 00:32:39,221
<i>we have everything.</i>

743
00:32:39,388 --> 00:32:40,806
You released animals
from cargo,

744
00:32:40,889 --> 00:32:42,599
and then you forced
an emergency landing.

745
00:32:42,766 --> 00:32:44,393
We also snuck onto the plane.

746
00:32:44,560 --> 00:32:46,186
That's right.
Theodore!

747
00:32:46,353 --> 00:32:49,273
That is three major
infractions on one flight.

748
00:32:49,523 --> 00:32:50,566
Here's a fun fact.

749
00:32:50,733 --> 00:32:52,943
That's three more infractions
than I've ever had

750
00:32:53,027 --> 00:32:54,445
in all my years
as an air marshal.

751
00:32:54,611 --> 00:32:56,905
Congratulations on such
a distinguished career, sir.

752
00:32:57,656 --> 00:32:59,033
Did you hear that?

753
00:32:59,199 --> 00:33:01,285
Because of that
"distinguished career"...

754
00:33:01,452 --> 00:33:03,120
I've got a meeting
with Homeland Security

755
00:33:03,203 --> 00:33:04,288
next week about a promotion.

756
00:33:04,496 --> 00:33:06,081
Another congratulations, sir.
Shut up!

757
00:33:06,165 --> 00:33:07,166
What do you think
they're gonna bring up

758
00:33:07,249 --> 00:33:08,375
when they interview me?

759
00:33:08,459 --> 00:33:11,712
My decade
of perfect service...

760
00:33:11,879 --> 00:33:13,881
or that one time
that three chipmunks

761
00:33:13,964 --> 00:33:16,091
turned my flight
into Noah's Ark?

762
00:33:16,383 --> 00:33:18,302
Probably the time
with the chipmunks.

763
00:33:18,385 --> 00:33:19,428
Yeah.

764
00:33:20,846 --> 00:33:22,765
Um, I meant the other one.

765
00:33:22,931 --> 00:33:25,351
Look, sir, what could
we possibly have done

766
00:33:25,434 --> 00:33:26,685
to make you hate us so much?

767
00:33:30,022 --> 00:33:31,982
I'll tell you what you did.

768
00:33:32,816 --> 00:33:33,817
Whoa!

769
00:33:33,942 --> 00:33:34,943
Holy Christmas.

770
00:33:37,196 --> 00:33:38,822
I got a little
early gift for you.

771
00:33:39,031 --> 00:33:40,491
James.

772
00:33:41,075 --> 00:33:42,368
You shouldn't have.

773
00:33:42,493 --> 00:33:43,494
No. Wait a second.

774
00:33:43,577 --> 00:33:45,871
I want to lnstagram
a video of your reaction.

775
00:33:46,872 --> 00:33:48,374
Merry Christmas!
I'm breaking up with you!

776
00:33:48,540 --> 00:33:49,625
What?

777
00:33:50,834 --> 00:33:51,835
Thanks.

778
00:33:53,212 --> 00:33:54,254
And The Chipmunks?

779
00:33:54,880 --> 00:33:56,048
Grow up, James.

780
00:33:56,382 --> 00:33:57,424
Wait.

781
00:34:09,603 --> 00:34:10,813
<i>Awkward .</i>

782
00:34:11,271 --> 00:34:14,441
You provided the soundtrack
to my heartbreak.

783
00:34:14,608 --> 00:34:16,443
But now it's payback time.

784
00:34:16,610 --> 00:34:20,489
I am putting you three on the
No-Fly List.

785
00:34:20,656 --> 00:34:21,865
What? No!
But we have to get to Miami!

786
00:34:21,949 --> 00:34:23,033
You can't do that!

787
00:34:23,117 --> 00:34:25,202
You see, I'm an air marshal.

788
00:34:25,369 --> 00:34:26,870
I'm all-powerful...

789
00:34:27,037 --> 00:34:28,372
I'm all-seeing...

790
00:34:28,539 --> 00:34:30,791
and I'm all-knowing.

791
00:34:30,958 --> 00:34:32,209
Then you obviously know

792
00:34:32,292 --> 00:34:33,877
you just made
that entire speech...

793
00:34:34,044 --> 00:34:35,712
with your tie
in a cup of coffee.

794
00:34:36,338 --> 00:34:38,132
Okay.

795
00:34:39,633 --> 00:34:41,093
I'll be back in two minutes.

796
00:34:41,427 --> 00:34:44,430
You also still have a little
parrot poop on your shirt.

797
00:34:44,596 --> 00:34:45,597
10 minutes.

798
00:34:45,889 --> 00:34:47,057
And one more thing.

799
00:34:47,224 --> 00:34:49,017
Don't even think
about leaving.

800
00:34:49,393 --> 00:34:51,728
I have a very particular
set of skills.

801
00:34:51,895 --> 00:34:53,480
Skills that I have acquired
over a very long...

802
00:34:53,647 --> 00:34:55,774
You just put your hand
on an ink pad.

803
00:34:59,445 --> 00:35:00,737
15 minutes.

804
00:35:06,285 --> 00:35:09,079
Whoa. That guy is the mayor
of Crazy Town.

805
00:35:09,246 --> 00:35:11,748
We gotta get you out of here,
now. Let's go.

806
00:35:14,209 --> 00:35:15,919
This is gonna be
the best...

807
00:35:19,965 --> 00:35:21,633
- Come on!
- Really?

808
00:35:23,135 --> 00:35:26,513
Nobody runs on
Agent James Suggs.

809
00:35:37,900 --> 00:35:39,735
Come on. Come on. Go.

810
00:35:39,902 --> 00:35:41,695
Here you go.
Thanks so much.

811
00:35:43,405 --> 00:35:45,157
Well, that's as far
as my money takes us.

812
00:35:45,324 --> 00:35:48,035
Which puts us 2 hours
and 30 minutes from Miami.

813
00:35:48,118 --> 00:35:49,119
- Hey!
- Yes!

814
00:35:49,203 --> 00:35:50,454
All right!
By plane.

815
00:35:50,621 --> 00:35:52,039
Come on!

816
00:35:52,206 --> 00:35:54,208
Guys, the party
is in three days.

817
00:35:54,374 --> 00:35:56,460
We need to get to Miami. Fast.

818
00:35:57,294 --> 00:36:00,506
And, as if we're not in enough
trouble already, it's Dave.

819
00:36:00,672 --> 00:36:01,965
Man.

820
00:36:02,132 --> 00:36:03,634
Well, we cannot
possibly pick up.

821
00:36:03,759 --> 00:36:04,760
We have to pick up,

822
00:36:04,843 --> 00:36:06,220
or Dave will know
something is wrong.

823
00:36:06,386 --> 00:36:07,679
Dave's gonna know
something's wrong

824
00:36:07,763 --> 00:36:09,723
when he sees us standing
around a bunch of trash cans,

825
00:36:09,806 --> 00:36:12,142
in a parking lot
in the middle of nowhere!

826
00:36:12,226 --> 00:36:13,519
Good point.

827
00:36:14,895 --> 00:36:15,896
Ready to go eat?

828
00:36:16,355 --> 00:36:17,397
... Yeah.

829
00:36:17,481 --> 00:36:18,482
Everything okay?

830
00:36:18,607 --> 00:36:20,025
Let me check on something.

831
00:36:20,859 --> 00:36:21,860
Hello?

832
00:36:22,027 --> 00:36:23,445
Hi, it's Dave. Are you busy?

833
00:36:23,612 --> 00:36:25,030
<i>Hi, Dave.</i>

834
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:26,782
No, I'm not busy at all.

835
00:36:26,865 --> 00:36:29,826
No, I'm just dining
with a friend.

836
00:36:29,993 --> 00:36:30,994
What do you need?

837
00:36:31,161 --> 00:36:32,162
All right, I'm gonna
take a look.

838
00:36:32,246 --> 00:36:33,288
I'm right at the window.

839
00:36:35,457 --> 00:36:37,584
No!

840
00:36:39,753 --> 00:36:41,338
They've eaten everything!

841
00:36:42,923 --> 00:36:44,883
And I mean everything!

842
00:36:45,050 --> 00:36:46,301
Yeah, that sounds about right.

843
00:36:46,468 --> 00:36:48,679
Just like a guinea pig
Armageddon!

844
00:36:48,845 --> 00:36:50,889
Well, thanks for checking
on them, Miss Price.

845
00:36:53,225 --> 00:36:54,268
False alarm.

846
00:36:54,351 --> 00:36:55,352
Soundsfike
they're having a blast.

847
00:36:55,435 --> 00:36:56,436
Good.

848
00:36:56,520 --> 00:36:57,813
You ready?
Yeah.

849
00:37:01,149 --> 00:37:04,528
Um, Alvin, I think maybe we
should go somewhere else.

850
00:37:04,695 --> 00:37:07,447
Whoa, hey. Sorry, fellas.
21 and over.

851
00:37:07,614 --> 00:37:08,907
But it's dark outside,

852
00:37:08,991 --> 00:37:10,450
and we don't have
anywhere else to go.

853
00:37:10,617 --> 00:37:11,994
Well, I wish I could
help you out,

854
00:37:12,077 --> 00:37:13,453
but I got a bar
packed with people...

855
00:37:13,620 --> 00:37:14,830
waiting to hear a band

856
00:37:14,913 --> 00:37:17,457
whose singer is stuck 50 miles
from here with a flat tire.

857
00:37:17,624 --> 00:37:19,918
So, unless you guys know
anyone who can carry a tune...

858
00:37:20,085 --> 00:37:21,503
I'm gonna have to
bid you good night.

859
00:37:22,296 --> 00:37:24,923
How would you feel
about some singing chipmunks?

860
00:37:25,382 --> 00:37:26,800
Whoa! You guys really
know The Chipettes?

861
00:37:27,259 --> 00:37:28,260
... Really?

862
00:37:28,927 --> 00:37:30,095
<i>Please welcome, all the way</i>

863
00:37:30,178 --> 00:37:31,513
<i>from Los Angeles,
California...</i>

864
00:37:31,680 --> 00:37:33,015
<i>The Chipmunks.</i>

865
00:37:34,308 --> 00:37:35,309
Ooh!

866
00:37:38,895 --> 00:37:39,980
<i>Warm crowd.</i>

867
00:37:40,939 --> 00:37:42,983
So, can you really play?

868
00:37:43,358 --> 00:37:44,735
Can you really sing?

869
00:37:54,083 --> 00:37:56,335
<i>Whoo! Put your hands
together for me.</i>

870
00:37:56,418 --> 00:37:57,836
<i>Um! Feels good.</i>

871
00:37:59,338 --> 00:38:00,422
<i>Come on, bass.</i>

872
00:38:03,842 --> 00:38:05,094
<i>More guitar.</i>

873
00:38:06,637 --> 00:38:09,765
<i>My man on drums.
We're taking it to the verse.</i>

874
00:38:49,888 --> 00:38:51,431
Wh00!

875
00:39:00,482 --> 00:39:02,359
This is where your guy said he
dropped off the little freaks?

876
00:39:02,442 --> 00:39:04,027
Yeah. That'll be 76 bucks.

877
00:39:04,111 --> 00:39:06,113
Okay. I'm law enforcement,
so...

878
00:39:06,196 --> 00:39:08,115
Great. 76 bucks.

879
00:39:08,824 --> 00:39:11,285
Let me rephrase that.
I'm the police of the sky.

880
00:39:11,535 --> 00:39:13,328
But we're on the ground
and this is a car.

881
00:39:13,453 --> 00:39:14,454
So...

882
00:39:14,538 --> 00:39:15,539
76 bucks.

883
00:39:15,622 --> 00:39:16,623
So, that means nothing to you?

884
00:39:16,707 --> 00:39:17,708
Nope.

885
00:39:19,042 --> 00:39:20,252
Okay, I'll be right back.
Don't leave.

886
00:39:20,419 --> 00:39:22,421
The money!
I'm getting it!

887
00:39:35,184 --> 00:39:36,185
Yeah!

888
00:39:39,855 --> 00:39:42,274
It's on.

889
00:39:43,069 --> 00:39:45,155
Alvin,
we've got a problem.

890
00:39:45,321 --> 00:39:46,322
No.

891
00:39:46,489 --> 00:39:48,408
I'll distract him,
you guys make a run for it.

892
00:39:48,575 --> 00:39:49,742
I'll meet you outside.

893
00:39:50,326 --> 00:39:51,870
How dare you!

894
00:39:52,662 --> 00:39:53,997
Over here.

895
00:39:55,248 --> 00:39:56,291
Gotcha!

896
00:40:03,131 --> 00:40:04,215
Let me explain.

897
00:40:04,549 --> 00:40:06,134
I have a reason to believe

898
00:40:06,217 --> 00:40:09,512
there's a fugitive chipmunk
in your beard.

899
00:40:09,679 --> 00:40:11,306
You don't think
I'd know if there was

900
00:40:11,389 --> 00:40:13,808
an animal living in my beard?

901
00:40:15,101 --> 00:40:16,561
I don't.
Beard peanuts?

902
00:40:16,728 --> 00:40:17,729
Gotcha!

903
00:40:21,983 --> 00:40:23,151
Watch where
you're throwing people!

904
00:40:23,234 --> 00:40:24,319
What are you
gonna do about it?

905
00:40:34,120 --> 00:40:35,246
I am so sorry.

906
00:40:35,413 --> 00:40:36,539
Yeah, sorry about the fight.

907
00:40:36,706 --> 00:40:38,249
Ain't no apology necessary.

908
00:40:38,416 --> 00:40:39,626
Nothing better for business

909
00:40:39,709 --> 00:40:41,794
than a good old-fashioned
bar brawl.

910
00:40:41,961 --> 00:40:43,421
Good luck, outlaws.
Thanks.

911
00:40:43,588 --> 00:40:45,965
Hey, hey, hey.
Come on, keep it in there!

912
00:40:48,259 --> 00:40:49,302
Yikes!

913
00:41:16,287 --> 00:41:17,997
Ha!

914
00:41:18,206 --> 00:41:19,207
You come on!

915
00:41:28,550 --> 00:41:30,760
I will slice and dice you
like spicy sushi roll!

916
00:41:35,848 --> 00:41:37,225
Missed me!

917
00:41:37,308 --> 00:41:38,309
Ha! Ha!

918
00:41:39,310 --> 00:41:40,562
You want some
butter with that?

919
00:41:42,939 --> 00:41:44,399
Drinks are on you!

920
00:41:49,529 --> 00:41:50,530
What?

921
00:42:06,963 --> 00:42:08,089
Solong,Suggsy!

922
00:42:10,049 --> 00:42:12,010
Get out of the way,
hillbillies!

923
00:42:12,176 --> 00:42:14,637
I need to get out
of this bar ASAP!

924
00:42:14,804 --> 00:42:15,972
Hey, we gotta get out of here.

925
00:42:16,055 --> 00:42:17,056
Butwhere's Alvin?

926
00:42:17,140 --> 00:42:18,182
We're gonna leave, man!

927
00:42:18,349 --> 00:42:20,226
I'm waiting on a guy
that owes me 76 bucks.

928
00:42:22,562 --> 00:42:23,563
You mean that guy?

929
00:42:24,188 --> 00:42:25,189
You know what,
we'll double it.

930
00:42:25,273 --> 00:42:26,274
All right.

931
00:42:26,357 --> 00:42:28,067
But Alvin's not here yet!
Forget about him, let's go!

932
00:42:28,151 --> 00:42:29,152
Wait, wait!

933
00:42:29,277 --> 00:42:30,278
There he is, there he is!

934
00:42:30,403 --> 00:42:31,404
You...

935
00:42:31,487 --> 00:42:32,697
Come on, let's go, come on!
Come on, Alvin!

936
00:42:32,780 --> 00:42:33,865
Hurry, hurry!

937
00:42:34,032 --> 00:42:35,074
Miles, give me your belt.

938
00:42:35,241 --> 00:42:37,076
You little hood rats!
Alvin, run!

939
00:42:37,243 --> 00:42:39,329
I will hunt you down!

940
00:42:39,662 --> 00:42:40,705
Slow down!

941
00:42:40,872 --> 00:42:41,873
Move your furry little feet!

942
00:42:42,040 --> 00:42:43,625
Alvin, let's go!
Hurry, Alvin!

943
00:42:43,791 --> 00:42:45,585
I will pounce on you!

944
00:42:45,752 --> 00:42:47,003
Alvin, jump!

945
00:42:47,170 --> 00:42:48,338
Hurry up, Alvin, come on!

946
00:42:48,630 --> 00:42:49,714
I will...

947
00:42:51,090 --> 00:42:52,091
Whoopsie.

948
00:42:52,175 --> 00:42:53,259
...take a little nap.

949
00:42:56,304 --> 00:42:58,306
So, how much
is this gonna cost?

950
00:42:58,473 --> 00:43:00,683
To the nearest
bus station, $32.

951
00:43:00,850 --> 00:43:02,810
we're a little short.

952
00:43:02,977 --> 00:43:04,062
How short?

953
00:43:04,228 --> 00:43:05,313
About 32 bucks.

954
00:43:11,110 --> 00:43:12,487
Have a nice night.

955
00:43:14,072 --> 00:43:15,365
Easy for you to say.

956
00:43:15,531 --> 00:43:17,867
You're not the one
who has to sleep outside!

957
00:43:18,034 --> 00:43:20,453
Thanks for nothing!
Drive safely!

958
00:43:21,371 --> 00:43:22,372
What?

959
00:43:22,455 --> 00:43:24,457
I hope he gets home safe.

960
00:43:26,209 --> 00:43:27,210
Ouch!

961
00:43:27,335 --> 00:43:30,254
I got
a splinter in my tail.

962
00:43:35,510 --> 00:43:37,762
I can't sleep
without my pillow.

963
00:43:39,222 --> 00:43:40,264
I don't suppose they make

964
00:43:40,348 --> 00:43:42,684
Tempur-Pedic tree branches,
do they?

965
00:43:43,017 --> 00:43:45,103
Seriously, guys?

966
00:43:45,269 --> 00:43:46,312
You're the ones who
are supposed to be

967
00:43:46,396 --> 00:43:48,147
comfortable sleeping in trees,
not me.

968
00:43:48,314 --> 00:43:50,024
We're not talking to you,
okay?

969
00:43:50,191 --> 00:43:52,110
Not after you tried
to leave me behind!

970
00:43:52,276 --> 00:43:53,861
First, awesome, because

971
00:43:53,945 --> 00:43:55,822
I don't wanna
talk to you either.

972
00:43:55,988 --> 00:43:59,158
And second, you guys would've
done the same thing to me.

973
00:43:59,325 --> 00:44:02,745
No, Miles, we actually
would have waited for you.

974
00:44:02,912 --> 00:44:04,706
Yeah, we're in this together.

975
00:44:04,872 --> 00:44:07,750
You mess with one of us,
you mess with all of us.

976
00:44:07,917 --> 00:44:09,460
I've heard your lame
family motto, man.

977
00:44:09,627 --> 00:44:10,628
It's a bunch of crap.

978
00:44:10,795 --> 00:44:12,630
People look out
for themselves.

979
00:44:12,797 --> 00:44:14,507
It's biology,
it's what animals do.

980
00:44:14,674 --> 00:44:17,260
Well, on behalf of
animals everywhere...

981
00:44:17,427 --> 00:44:19,220
I find your
attitude insulting.

982
00:44:19,387 --> 00:44:21,597
Call it whatever you want,
man. It's true.

983
00:44:22,390 --> 00:44:23,516
What, you think my dad was

984
00:44:23,599 --> 00:44:24,809
thinking about anyone
other than himself...

985
00:44:24,976 --> 00:44:26,310
when he left me and my mom?

986
00:44:26,477 --> 00:44:27,520
But, I...

987
00:44:27,979 --> 00:44:30,064
I thought you said
your dad was...

988
00:44:35,403 --> 00:44:36,654
Right, um...

989
00:44:38,990 --> 00:44:41,576
He might as well have.
He left when I was only five.

990
00:44:42,368 --> 00:44:43,703
Sorry, Miles.

991
00:44:43,786 --> 00:44:44,787
Whatever.

992
00:44:45,913 --> 00:44:47,457
I don't care, you know?

993
00:44:48,958 --> 00:44:50,793
I've done just fine
without him.

994
00:44:50,960 --> 00:44:52,253
Miles, listen.

995
00:44:52,420 --> 00:44:54,964
If Dave and your mom
end up together...

996
00:44:55,131 --> 00:44:56,799
he's a good person.

997
00:44:56,966 --> 00:44:58,718
He would never bail on you.

998
00:44:59,927 --> 00:45:01,763
Then why are you
making this trip?

999
00:45:04,557 --> 00:45:05,558
Right.

1000
00:45:06,642 --> 00:45:08,770
Because you think
he's gonna ditch you, too.

1001
00:45:12,356 --> 00:45:14,192
Look, dads are overrated.

1002
00:45:15,818 --> 00:45:18,362
Eventually, you will
get over him leaving.

1003
00:45:20,031 --> 00:45:21,073
Really?

1004
00:45:23,618 --> 00:45:24,619
Yeah.

1005
00:46:04,826 --> 00:46:06,577
I can't...

1006
00:46:06,744 --> 00:46:08,955
I'm too tired.

1007
00:46:09,330 --> 00:46:10,331
Dude!

1008
00:46:11,415 --> 00:46:12,750
Are you joking?

1009
00:46:14,502 --> 00:46:16,003
I can still see the tree!

1010
00:46:19,799 --> 00:46:21,300
Come on, it's 10 miles
to the bus station.

1011
00:46:21,384 --> 00:46:22,760
Can't you go any faster?

1012
00:46:22,885 --> 00:46:24,470
Um, not to split hairs,

1013
00:46:24,554 --> 00:46:27,265
but given that our legs
are 90% shorter than yours...

1014
00:46:28,474 --> 00:46:32,520
...we're technically walking
384% faster than you are.

1015
00:46:32,687 --> 00:46:34,146
Nerd alert!

1016
00:46:34,355 --> 00:46:35,982
Um...

1017
00:46:39,110 --> 00:46:40,278
Fine.

1018
00:46:40,444 --> 00:46:41,487
Come on up.

1019
00:46:41,696 --> 00:46:42,947
Really?

1020
00:46:43,114 --> 00:46:44,240
Changing my mind in three...

1021
00:46:44,407 --> 00:46:45,658
All right!
Yes!

1022
00:46:45,825 --> 00:46:46,826
Two...

1023
00:46:47,076 --> 00:46:48,077
<i>ODE.</i>

1024
00:46:48,160 --> 00:46:49,412
Come on, come on!
Whoo-hoo!

1025
00:46:50,872 --> 00:46:51,873
Thank you.

1026
00:46:51,956 --> 00:46:52,957
Sweet!

1027
00:46:53,040 --> 00:46:56,210
Now this is quite
an efficient way to travel.

1028
00:46:56,377 --> 00:46:58,588
Yeah. I could go for miles
on Miles.

1029
00:46:58,930 --> 00:47:00,348
My God, that's so bad.

1030
00:47:00,514 --> 00:47:01,974
Then why are you laughing?

1031
00:47:02,141 --> 00:47:03,434
Because that was so bad.

1032
00:47:03,601 --> 00:47:05,686
I think thatjoke
missed by miles.

1033
00:48:04,829 --> 00:48:06,747
Yeah, this is where I
dropped them, all right.

1034
00:48:06,914 --> 00:48:08,708
Look how obvious
these tracks are.

1035
00:48:10,876 --> 00:48:12,003
Amateurs.

1036
00:48:21,095 --> 00:48:23,055
<i>s' Hey HOW! Hey now!
4“ Hey now!</i>

1037
00:48:33,441 --> 00:48:35,568
Only 863 miles to go.

1038
00:48:42,616 --> 00:48:44,452
Did some chipmunks
jump on your bus?

1039
00:48:44,618 --> 00:48:47,163
Um-They bought a ticket
to New Orleans.

1040
00:48:49,123 --> 00:48:50,750
You know
that's not normal, right?

1041
00:49:01,390 --> 00:49:02,766
All right! Nice!

1042
00:49:05,686 --> 00:49:07,604
All right! A tater tot!

1043
00:49:07,771 --> 00:49:10,357
Looks like our luck is finally
turning around.

1044
00:49:10,524 --> 00:49:11,775
It's not.

1045
00:49:12,443 --> 00:49:13,819
No! Suggs?

1046
00:49:14,028 --> 00:49:15,195
Hello, boys.

1047
00:49:15,362 --> 00:49:16,530
How did you find us?

1048
00:49:18,949 --> 00:49:20,951
I'm an air marshal!

1049
00:49:21,118 --> 00:49:23,203
Law enforcement's my life.

1050
00:49:23,704 --> 00:49:26,165
Now, we can either do this
the easy way...

1051
00:49:26,540 --> 00:49:27,916
or the hard way.

1052
00:49:28,292 --> 00:49:30,878
My brothers and I would like
to discuss our options.

1053
00:49:31,420 --> 00:49:32,880
You only got one option.

1054
00:49:33,047 --> 00:49:34,340
Chipmunkjail.

1055
00:49:34,506 --> 00:49:36,008
With tiny little bars,

1056
00:49:36,091 --> 00:49:38,177
and a tiny little barbed wire
fence, and a tiny toilet...

1057
00:49:38,344 --> 00:49:41,513
and a tiny yard where you can
lift your tiny little weights!

1058
00:49:41,847 --> 00:49:43,349
It sounds adorable.

1059
00:49:43,891 --> 00:49:44,892
Hey!

1060
00:49:44,975 --> 00:49:46,518
Guys, slingshot. On three.

1061
00:49:46,894 --> 00:49:48,771
One, two, three!
Now, I don't have all night.

1062
00:49:49,605 --> 00:49:50,773
Nuts.

1063
00:49:50,939 --> 00:49:52,274
We chose the hard way.

1064
00:49:53,734 --> 00:49:54,985
Hope you're okay.

1065
00:49:56,403 --> 00:49:57,654
- He's coming!
- Watch out, gangway!

1066
00:49:57,738 --> 00:49:58,822
Hurry, Theodore, run!

1067
00:49:58,906 --> 00:50:00,449
Let's go! Come on, hurry up!
Excuse us!

1068
00:50:00,532 --> 00:50:02,201
Come on, Alvin! He's coming!
Go, Miles, go!

1069
00:50:02,284 --> 00:50:03,827
Excuse me, I'm sorry.
In here! Come on!

1070
00:50:07,289 --> 00:50:08,957
Whoo, I think we lost him.
Hey!

1071
00:50:09,041 --> 00:50:10,042
Disregard.

1072
00:50:10,125 --> 00:50:11,126
Come back here!

1073
00:50:13,799 --> 00:50:14,841
Excuse me, pardon me.

1074
00:50:14,925 --> 00:50:16,134
There's a crazy guy
chasing us!

1075
00:50:20,138 --> 00:50:23,225
You look tired, baby.
Here you go.

1076
00:50:23,391 --> 00:50:24,392
Thank you so much.

1077
00:50:27,103 --> 00:50:28,104
Nice one, Suggsy!

1078
00:50:28,271 --> 00:50:29,439
That tastes like fire!

1079
00:50:29,856 --> 00:50:30,899
It's moonshine.

1080
00:50:30,982 --> 00:50:32,275
Fire, please put it out!

1081
00:50:32,442 --> 00:50:33,652
Wash it down with this, here.

1082
00:50:34,945 --> 00:50:35,987
Um, ooh...

1083
00:50:36,071 --> 00:50:37,113
That's butterscotch.

1084
00:50:37,280 --> 00:50:38,323
Butterscotch liquor.

1085
00:50:38,406 --> 00:50:39,783
Ooh!

1086
00:50:40,033 --> 00:50:41,451
And moonshine!

1087
00:50:42,911 --> 00:50:43,912
Hi, Suggs!

1088
00:50:43,995 --> 00:50:45,622
Yes!

1089
00:50:47,332 --> 00:50:48,875
Thank you, Mr. Trombone.

1090
00:50:49,042 --> 00:50:51,044
This calls for a celebration!

1091
00:50:52,170 --> 00:50:54,214
Hello, New Orleans!

1092
00:50:54,714 --> 00:50:57,217
Direct from our Austin
to Miami Comeback Tour,

1093
00:50:57,300 --> 00:50:59,553
we're The Chipmunks!

1094
00:51:01,137 --> 00:51:03,640
ls everybody ready
to get their funk on?

1095
00:51:25,829 --> 00:51:26,830
Okay.

1096
00:51:59,070 --> 00:52:00,322
<i>4' Hey!</i>

1097
00:52:18,006 --> 00:52:19,132
What's happening?
What's happening?

1098
00:52:48,370 --> 00:52:50,330
<i>T He)', hey, hey!</i>

1099
00:52:59,130 --> 00:53:00,507
This whole day
has been incredible.

1100
00:53:00,674 --> 00:53:01,967
It's been the perfect day.

1101
00:53:02,133 --> 00:53:03,760
<i>Coming up,
The Chipmunks are back.</i>

1102
00:53:03,843 --> 00:53:04,970
What?

1103
00:53:05,053 --> 00:53:06,221
<i>You heard me.
Alvin, Simon and Theodore...</i>

1104
00:53:06,304 --> 00:53:07,347
Excuse me, could you
turn that up, please?

1105
00:53:07,430 --> 00:53:08,431
Yeah, sure.

1106
00:53:08,515 --> 00:53:09,516
<i>...are making some noise
in the Big Easy...</i>

1107
00:53:09,599 --> 00:53:11,309
<i>When I say "Party,"
you say "Alvin!"</i>

1108
00:53:11,393 --> 00:53:13,061
<i>Party!</i>
Alvin!

1109
00:53:13,144 --> 00:53:14,145
No.

1110
00:53:14,229 --> 00:53:15,480
<i>Party!
Alvin!</i>

1111
00:53:15,647 --> 00:53:16,690
<i>Party!</i>

1112
00:53:17,149 --> 00:53:20,110
<i>Alvin!</i>

1113
00:53:20,194 --> 00:53:22,571
<i>Alvin!</i>

1114
00:53:25,783 --> 00:53:27,076
Did you guys hear that?

1115
00:53:27,159 --> 00:53:28,160
Hear what?

1116
00:53:28,452 --> 00:53:29,828
Never mind.

1117
00:53:29,995 --> 00:53:32,540
Guys, last night was one
of the best nights of my life.

1118
00:53:32,706 --> 00:53:34,416
It was pretty crazy.

1119
00:53:34,583 --> 00:53:36,335
Even that Suggs guy
hung out with us.

1120
00:53:36,502 --> 00:53:38,295
Yeah, he's not
that bad after all.

1121
00:53:38,462 --> 00:53:40,089
Hey, we missed
a call from Dave.

1122
00:53:40,923 --> 00:53:42,049
And a text.

1123
00:53:42,550 --> 00:53:43,968
27 of them.

1124
00:53:45,302 --> 00:53:46,303
No.

1125
00:53:51,433 --> 00:53:52,643
Where am I?

1126
00:53:53,602 --> 00:53:54,728
What is this?

1127
00:53:58,566 --> 00:53:59,858
Suggs!
Who are you?

1128
00:54:00,025 --> 00:54:02,695
It's Vitto,
the band's manager, remember?

1129
00:54:02,861 --> 00:54:04,905
The only thing I remember

1130
00:54:04,989 --> 00:54:08,200
is being attacked
by a trombone.

1131
00:54:08,367 --> 00:54:09,451
Right, yeah.

1132
00:54:09,618 --> 00:54:11,328
You got that crazy bump
on your head.

1133
00:54:11,495 --> 00:54:12,663
You didn't care, though.

1134
00:54:12,830 --> 00:54:14,832
You just wanted to party!

1135
00:54:15,040 --> 00:54:18,043
We hit every jazz club
in the Quarter.

1136
00:54:20,045 --> 00:54:21,463
What do you mean, "We"?

1137
00:54:21,630 --> 00:54:25,092
You, me, and those
dope chipmunk dudes!

1138
00:54:28,554 --> 00:54:32,933
I partied with
those tree-skunks?

1139
00:54:33,225 --> 00:54:35,978
They're the ones who dared you
to get that sassy tattoo!

1140
00:54:37,104 --> 00:54:39,523
What? What?

1141
00:54:43,986 --> 00:54:45,821
How could I have let them
talk me into this?

1142
00:54:46,113 --> 00:54:48,032
No.
You asked for that one.

1143
00:54:48,115 --> 00:54:50,242
The other one was their idea.

1144
00:54:52,911 --> 00:54:54,580
What "other one"?

1145
00:54:56,707 --> 00:54:57,708
What?

1146
00:55:09,637 --> 00:55:11,972
This is where they told us
to meet them, right?

1147
00:55:12,139 --> 00:55:14,475
Well, yelled at us
to meet them.

1148
00:55:14,642 --> 00:55:16,352
Hopefully they had time to
cool off on the plane.

1149
00:55:16,769 --> 00:55:17,811
There you are.

1150
00:55:17,895 --> 00:55:18,854
Dave!
Dave!

1151
00:55:18,937 --> 00:55:20,439
Mom!
Don't "Dave, Mom" us.

1152
00:55:20,522 --> 00:55:21,523
You know what, Dave?

1153
00:55:21,607 --> 00:55:23,108
You're an artist,
and you're emotional...

1154
00:55:23,233 --> 00:55:24,693
and you follow your heart,
but maybe

1155
00:55:24,777 --> 00:55:26,195
I should take
the lead on this one.

1156
00:55:26,362 --> 00:55:27,404
You know,
we keep a level head.

1157
00:55:27,488 --> 00:55:28,864
Throw them a little Good Cop.

1158
00:55:29,031 --> 00:55:30,658
Okay-
Okay-

1159
00:55:31,700 --> 00:55:32,868
Don't you "Dave, Mom" us.

1160
00:55:33,035 --> 00:55:35,412
Do you have any idea
how terrifying it is...

1161
00:55:35,579 --> 00:55:37,122
to find out that your children
are 2,000 miles

1162
00:55:37,206 --> 00:55:38,499
away from where
they're supposed to be?

1163
00:55:38,666 --> 00:55:40,084
You are lucky that
there are witnesses,

1164
00:55:40,167 --> 00:55:41,710
because I am
so mad right now...

1165
00:55:41,877 --> 00:55:43,295
that I could just spit!
Okay, okay.

1166
00:55:43,462 --> 00:55:44,672
Right here, on this floor!

1167
00:55:44,838 --> 00:55:47,383
Okay, okay. Nice Good Cop.

1168
00:55:47,549 --> 00:55:50,427
Dave, I swear, it wasn't as
crazy as it looked on TV.

1169
00:55:50,594 --> 00:55:51,637
Really?

1170
00:55:51,804 --> 00:55:52,971
Well, let me just
pull up some of

1171
00:55:53,055 --> 00:55:54,765
Theodore's tweets
from last night.

1172
00:55:55,474 --> 00:55:57,142
"Only one word
to describe this night,

1173
00:55:57,226 --> 00:55:59,269
"Crazy, crazy, crazy, crazy."

1174
00:55:59,436 --> 00:56:00,896
Or, "if you wanna get crazy,

1175
00:56:00,979 --> 00:56:02,481
"go to New Orleans.
It's the craziest."

1176
00:56:02,648 --> 00:56:04,692
Or, "In a New Orleans
Jazz Parade,

1177
00:56:04,775 --> 00:56:05,901
"so crazy."

1178
00:56:06,068 --> 00:56:07,111
We're really sorry, Dave.

1179
00:56:07,277 --> 00:56:08,946
Sorry's not gonna
cut it this time, guys.

1180
00:56:09,113 --> 00:56:11,031
If it were up to me,
we'd be going home,

1181
00:56:11,115 --> 00:56:12,700
but I gotta get back to Miami.

1182
00:56:13,200 --> 00:56:15,494
Do not smile.
You guys are grounded in Miami

1183
00:56:15,577 --> 00:56:16,745
and also when
we get back to LA.

1184
00:56:17,204 --> 00:56:18,831
When are we
not grounded?

1185
00:56:18,956 --> 00:56:20,874
You'll be so old,
your fur will be gray.

1186
00:56:21,041 --> 00:56:22,334
Yeah, that goes for
your fur too, Miles.

1187
00:56:22,418 --> 00:56:23,627
I don't have fur.

1188
00:56:23,711 --> 00:56:24,795
Well, whatever you have
is grounded...

1189
00:56:24,878 --> 00:56:26,338
for a long time. Let's go.

1190
00:56:27,464 --> 00:56:29,216
They didn't
kill us after all.

1191
00:56:29,299 --> 00:56:30,467
Feels like a win.

1192
00:56:30,551 --> 00:56:33,303
Hey, guys, Operation
"No Proposal" is still on.

1193
00:56:33,470 --> 00:56:34,930
Yeah!
All right!

1194
00:56:36,056 --> 00:56:37,141
High... Fist.

1195
00:56:37,307 --> 00:56:39,101
Give me some.

1196
00:56:39,226 --> 00:56:40,227
Sorry.
Take it easy!

1197
00:56:40,310 --> 00:56:41,437
- Guys, come on.
- Jeez.

1198
00:56:41,520 --> 00:56:42,521
Yeah.

1199
00:56:44,231 --> 00:56:45,357
Here you go.
Thank you.

1200
00:56:45,524 --> 00:56:47,067
You're welcome.
And may I see your ID, please?

1201
00:56:47,234 --> 00:56:48,235
Yes.

1202
00:56:49,111 --> 00:56:50,362
Thank you.

1203
00:56:50,529 --> 00:56:51,655
Hey, um...

1204
00:56:51,822 --> 00:56:53,449
Are you sure about this?

1205
00:56:53,615 --> 00:56:55,534
Because if this
three-ring circus

1206
00:56:55,617 --> 00:56:57,286
is too scary for you,
I totally get it...

1207
00:56:57,453 --> 00:56:59,288
and we could just
go back to LA.

1208
00:56:59,455 --> 00:57:00,998
I mean, you wouldn't be
the first guy

1209
00:57:01,081 --> 00:57:03,584
to head for the hills once
we showed our crazy cards.

1210
00:57:03,751 --> 00:57:05,586
Please, your circus
only has one ring.

1211
00:57:05,669 --> 00:57:07,171
Stop looking at me.

1212
00:57:07,254 --> 00:57:08,297
Mine's
the three-ringer.

1213
00:57:08,380 --> 00:57:09,423
You're the one
who should think

1214
00:57:09,506 --> 00:57:10,591
about heading for the hills.

1215
00:57:11,383 --> 00:57:12,968
I'm not going anywhere.

1216
00:57:13,135 --> 00:57:14,553
Except to get us a coffee.

1217
00:57:15,304 --> 00:57:16,430
I'll meet you at the gate.

1218
00:57:17,514 --> 00:57:18,515
Sir?

1219
00:57:19,057 --> 00:57:20,267
Is there a problem?

1220
00:57:20,350 --> 00:57:21,643
Problem? What problem?

1221
00:57:21,810 --> 00:57:23,061
There sure is.

1222
00:57:25,272 --> 00:57:26,648
Man.
Right.

1223
00:57:26,815 --> 00:57:28,066
Whoopsies.
That.

1224
00:57:28,233 --> 00:57:29,234
Guys.

1225
00:57:29,318 --> 00:57:30,611
Nuts.

1226
00:57:35,699 --> 00:57:38,452
Seriously, guys,
the No-Fly List? Come on!

1227
00:57:38,619 --> 00:57:40,412
At least we're not
on the No-Drive List.

1228
00:57:40,579 --> 00:57:42,790
There's no such thing
as a No-Drive List, Theodore.

1229
00:57:42,956 --> 00:57:44,875
I'm sure you guys will
find a way to start one.

1230
00:57:45,042 --> 00:57:46,794
Let's not overreact, Dave.

1231
00:57:46,960 --> 00:57:48,170
The only reason we left home
in the first place...

1232
00:57:48,253 --> 00:57:50,255
Guys, not now, okay?

1233
00:57:51,632 --> 00:57:52,966
I worked my butt off

1234
00:57:53,050 --> 00:57:55,219
on Ashley's album,
and because of you three...

1235
00:57:55,385 --> 00:57:57,513
I might not even get to
the record release!

1236
00:57:57,805 --> 00:58:00,557
Not to mention, you've ruined
this trip for me and Samantha.

1237
00:58:00,724 --> 00:58:03,143
It's just, when you took
Samantha to Miami...

1238
00:58:03,227 --> 00:58:04,728
Theodore, I'm not
in the mood to hear it.

1239
00:58:04,895 --> 00:58:06,063
But Dave, we don't...

1240
00:58:06,146 --> 00:58:08,440
Alvin, don't.
You'll just make it worse.

1241
00:58:11,568 --> 00:58:13,362
Thank you for nothing.

1242
00:58:15,030 --> 00:58:16,198
Agent Suggs, Air Marshal.

1243
00:58:16,281 --> 00:58:17,324
I'll be with you
in a moment, sir.

1244
00:58:17,407 --> 00:58:19,201
Okay, you're gonna
regret that.

1245
00:58:31,547 --> 00:58:34,299
Did you help three chipmunks
get their rental car today?

1246
00:58:34,466 --> 00:58:35,759
Yeah, they came in.

1247
00:58:35,926 --> 00:58:37,761
With some guy,
probably their dad.

1248
00:58:38,053 --> 00:58:39,847
Probably not their dad,
because he's a human...

1249
00:58:40,013 --> 00:58:41,682
and they're chipmunks!
Hey!

1250
00:58:42,766 --> 00:58:44,601
Families come in all
shapes and sizes, sir.

1251
00:58:44,852 --> 00:58:45,853
It's not for me to judge.

1252
00:58:45,936 --> 00:58:47,229
We don't do that here,
at Miss Bee's.

1253
00:58:47,396 --> 00:58:49,106
Okay, this is how
it's gonna go down...

1254
00:58:49,273 --> 00:58:50,607
I need you to go back there,

1255
00:58:50,691 --> 00:58:53,443
and get me the GPS information
for that rental car.

1256
00:58:53,944 --> 00:58:56,029
We don't track
our rental cars, sir.

1257
00:58:56,196 --> 00:58:57,698
Is that so?

1258
00:58:58,574 --> 00:59:00,909
I work for the United States
government...

1259
00:59:01,076 --> 00:59:03,161
and we pretty much
track everything.

1260
00:59:03,328 --> 00:59:04,872
I know what you had
for lunch today.

1261
00:59:05,789 --> 00:59:06,790
Falafel!

1262
00:59:07,249 --> 00:59:08,333
Now scurry back there,

1263
00:59:08,417 --> 00:59:09,835
and get me the frequency

1264
00:59:09,918 --> 00:59:11,837
and uplink code
from that rental car.

1265
00:59:12,796 --> 00:59:13,797
Hey!

1266
00:59:14,047 --> 00:59:17,467
And I need the fastest set
of wheels you've got!

1267
00:59:24,016 --> 00:59:26,018
Are you kidding me right now?

1268
00:59:26,393 --> 00:59:27,561
Do you know what this is?

1269
00:59:27,728 --> 00:59:29,855
This is a roller skate
with wheels.

1270
00:59:30,022 --> 00:59:31,607
Pretty sure roller skates
come with wheels.

1271
00:59:36,278 --> 00:59:38,071
It's like Tweety Bird!

1272
00:59:38,989 --> 00:59:39,990
Buckle up!

1273
00:59:40,157 --> 00:59:41,158
Shut up!

1274
00:59:41,909 --> 00:59:44,119
This is like driving
a parakeet!

1275
00:59:49,958 --> 00:59:52,753
Those rodents got
a 200-mile head start.

1276
00:59:53,587 --> 00:59:56,506
Time to roll up
some road, Suggs.

1277
01:00:11,980 --> 01:00:13,941
Come on!

1278
01:00:14,524 --> 01:00:17,110
Fly, Bee! Fly!

1279
01:00:17,319 --> 01:00:19,071
- Are we there yet?
- No.

1280
01:00:19,196 --> 01:00:20,405
Are we there yet?
No.

1281
01:00:20,572 --> 01:00:22,032
Are we there yet?
No.

1282
01:00:23,575 --> 01:00:25,118
- All right!
- Awesome!

1283
01:00:25,243 --> 01:00:26,912
Remember, guys, we're here
to make a quick pit stop...

1284
01:00:27,079 --> 01:00:28,413
then we're getting
back on the road.

1285
01:00:28,580 --> 01:00:30,082
Don't worry, Dave,
it'll be really quick.

1286
01:00:30,248 --> 01:00:31,917
Yeah, super quick.

1287
01:00:32,292 --> 01:00:34,086
Umm-

1288
01:00:34,920 --> 01:00:36,630
Thanks, Dave. I just needed

1289
01:00:36,755 --> 01:00:39,341
a little snack to get me
from lunch to dinner.

1290
01:00:39,508 --> 01:00:40,926
That's unusual.

1291
01:00:41,093 --> 01:00:42,260
Don't be mad, Dave.

1292
01:00:42,427 --> 01:00:44,179
It would have been rude
to not order something.

1293
01:00:44,346 --> 01:00:47,474
Hey, guys! Look what I won!
Isn't he cute?

1294
01:00:47,599 --> 01:00:49,434
Look at that face!

1295
01:00:49,601 --> 01:00:50,852
That's actually funny, Alvin.

1296
01:01:04,616 --> 01:01:06,326
Whoa!
All right!

1297
01:01:09,454 --> 01:01:10,956
Now we're talking.

1298
01:01:11,123 --> 01:01:12,290
WOW.

1299
01:01:14,459 --> 01:01:16,795
Holy guacamole!

1300
01:01:16,962 --> 01:01:18,296
I could live here.

1301
01:01:18,547 --> 01:01:19,548
Hey, no smiling.

1302
01:01:19,631 --> 01:01:21,216
You're still grounded,
remember?

1303
01:01:21,842 --> 01:01:23,719
Thanks.
Thank you.

1304
01:01:23,885 --> 01:01:25,679
This is what
I'm talking about.

1305
01:01:25,887 --> 01:01:26,888
Hi.

1306
01:01:26,972 --> 01:01:29,141
Wow! <i>Hola!</i>

1307
01:01:30,308 --> 01:01:31,643
on, baby.

1308
01:01:31,810 --> 01:01:33,061
If this is grounded...

1309
01:01:33,228 --> 01:01:34,396
ground me for life.

1310
01:01:34,563 --> 01:01:35,647
Don't tempt me.

1311
01:01:37,399 --> 01:01:38,442
Hey, Dave!

1312
01:01:38,525 --> 01:01:40,027
We'd like to do
the mature thing...

1313
01:01:40,193 --> 01:01:41,945
and accept
partial responsibility

1314
01:01:42,029 --> 01:01:43,530
for all the trouble
we've caused.

1315
01:01:43,697 --> 01:01:44,698
Partial?
Yeah.

1316
01:01:44,865 --> 01:01:46,116
60-40, on us.

1317
01:01:47,075 --> 01:01:48,493
70-30?

1318
01:01:48,869 --> 01:01:50,787
As much as I hate the idea of
letting you three

1319
01:01:50,871 --> 01:01:52,706
out of my sight
for even a second...

1320
01:01:52,873 --> 01:01:55,834
Samantha and I have dinner
plans that I can't get out of.

1321
01:01:56,001 --> 01:01:57,753
So if anything happens,
we'll be at the villa.

1322
01:01:57,919 --> 01:01:59,337
Ooh, romantic.

1323
01:01:59,546 --> 01:02:01,048
What?

1324
01:02:02,049 --> 01:02:03,508
Hi.
Hi.

1325
01:02:03,675 --> 01:02:05,719
All right, you are
not to leave this room.

1326
01:02:05,886 --> 01:02:07,387
Do you understand, young man?
Yeah.

1327
01:02:07,554 --> 01:02:09,347
You guys don't
have to worry about us.

1328
01:02:09,514 --> 01:02:11,767
We'll be on our
best behavior tonight.

1329
01:02:11,933 --> 01:02:13,268
I promise. Whoa.

1330
01:02:13,435 --> 01:02:14,603
I know you will,
because I hired

1331
01:02:14,686 --> 01:02:16,063
a babysitter to keep
an eye on you.

1332
01:02:16,229 --> 01:02:17,355
What? Come on.
Man.

1333
01:02:17,522 --> 01:02:18,940
We'll be home after the party.

1334
01:02:22,944 --> 01:02:24,362
Almost forgot this.

1335
01:02:31,536 --> 01:02:32,913
Dave is going
to propose tonight.

1336
01:02:33,038 --> 01:02:34,206
What gave that away?

1337
01:02:34,372 --> 01:02:35,874
The romantic dinner
or the engagement ring?

1338
01:02:36,291 --> 01:02:37,626
Alvin, what are we
going to do?

1339
01:02:37,793 --> 01:02:39,377
Absolutely nothing.

1340
01:02:39,544 --> 01:02:40,962
What?
Alvin's right.

1341
01:02:41,129 --> 01:02:43,256
This hasn't been so bad.

1342
01:02:44,424 --> 01:02:46,051
Maybe we just...

1343
01:02:46,718 --> 01:02:47,886
do nothing.
"Nothing"?

1344
01:02:48,053 --> 01:02:51,223
Guys, "nothing" isn't a plan!
We can't do "nothing."

1345
01:02:51,389 --> 01:02:52,557
Sure we can.

1346
01:02:52,724 --> 01:02:54,893
Good luck proposing
without this.

1347
01:02:54,976 --> 01:02:57,229
Alvin!
When did you grab it?

1348
01:02:57,395 --> 01:02:59,648
I found it in his bag,
five minutes ago.

1349
01:02:59,898 --> 01:03:01,733
Does that mean we did it?

1350
01:03:01,900 --> 01:03:02,901
We did it.

1351
01:03:03,401 --> 01:03:04,361
Huzzah!

1352
01:03:11,451 --> 01:03:13,078
Whoo-hoo! We did it!

1353
01:03:13,495 --> 01:03:15,747
We did it! Wh00-h00!

1354
01:03:22,838 --> 01:03:25,674
Come on, Miles,
join the party?

1355
01:03:27,342 --> 01:03:28,426
Miles?

1356
01:03:31,847 --> 01:03:33,807
Miles, wait up!
Come on, man.

1357
01:03:33,974 --> 01:03:35,016
Let's celebrate! We did it!

1358
01:03:35,183 --> 01:03:36,268
Yeah.

1359
01:03:36,434 --> 01:03:37,477
You guys ruined
Dave's proposal

1360
01:03:37,602 --> 01:03:38,603
and now we
don't have to hang out.

1361
01:03:38,770 --> 01:03:39,938
Miles, hold on.

1362
01:03:40,105 --> 01:03:41,481
That doesn't mean
we can't be friends.

1363
01:03:41,648 --> 01:03:42,649
Yeah, man.

1364
01:03:42,816 --> 01:03:44,442
I thought we had a great time
in New Orleans.

1365
01:03:44,609 --> 01:03:45,944
So did I. And then
I saw you celebrating

1366
01:03:46,027 --> 01:03:47,070
like you won the Super Bowl...

1367
01:03:47,154 --> 01:03:49,072
the second you found out
we weren't gonna be family.

1368
01:03:49,156 --> 01:03:50,365
So... see you.

1369
01:03:50,782 --> 01:03:52,826
Miles, wait! I can explain!

1370
01:03:52,993 --> 01:03:54,828
Guys, come on. Miles...

1371
01:03:55,287 --> 01:03:57,247
We've been through
a lot together.

1372
01:03:57,330 --> 01:03:58,665
Don't walk away now.

1373
01:03:58,832 --> 01:03:59,875
Yeah. Come on, Miles.

1374
01:04:02,711 --> 01:04:03,712
Miles?

1375
01:04:04,171 --> 01:04:05,630
Miles? Miles!

1376
01:04:05,964 --> 01:04:07,465
Watch out!

1377
01:04:07,632 --> 01:04:08,884
Alvin, he can't hear us!

1378
01:04:09,050 --> 01:04:10,343
I'll knock him out of the way!

1379
01:04:10,510 --> 01:04:12,012
Slingshot on three!
Let's do this.

1380
01:04:12,095 --> 01:04:13,054
One...

1381
01:04:13,138 --> 01:04:14,139
two...

1382
01:04:14,222 --> 01:04:15,223
three!

1383
01:04:15,390 --> 01:04:16,683
Whoa!

1384
01:04:27,027 --> 01:04:28,236
Theo.
Theodore!

1385
01:04:31,907 --> 01:04:33,158
Theo.
Theodore.

1386
01:04:33,325 --> 01:04:35,076
Is he okay?
I don't know.

1387
01:04:35,243 --> 01:04:38,872
Theo! Come on! Get up! Please!

1388
01:04:44,377 --> 01:04:45,837
No! Theodore!

1389
01:04:46,004 --> 01:04:47,005
Come on!

1390
01:04:47,172 --> 01:04:48,173
Say something, say something!

1391
01:04:49,549 --> 01:04:51,509
I smell...

1392
01:04:52,385 --> 01:04:53,428
empanadas?

1393
01:04:53,511 --> 01:04:54,512
Theo!

1394
01:04:55,180 --> 01:04:56,181
Theo, you're alive!

1395
01:04:56,514 --> 01:04:57,557
Is this Heaven?

1396
01:04:57,724 --> 01:04:58,850
No, it's South Beach.

1397
01:05:00,018 --> 01:05:02,062
Theodore, you saved my life.

1398
01:05:02,187 --> 01:05:05,190
Like we always say,
you mess with one of us...

1399
01:05:05,774 --> 01:05:07,734
Don't make me say it, man,
it's so lame.

1400
01:05:07,901 --> 01:05:09,945
Miles, he got hit
by a car for you.

1401
01:05:10,570 --> 01:05:12,322
You mess with all of us.
All right!

1402
01:05:12,405 --> 01:05:14,574
Whoo-hoo! Ouch!

1403
01:05:14,699 --> 01:05:17,118
Miles, we are so sorry.

1404
01:05:17,285 --> 01:05:20,121
We haven't been fair to you
from day one.

1405
01:05:20,288 --> 01:05:21,581
And the truth is...

1406
01:05:23,375 --> 01:05:25,252
you'd make a great brother.

1407
01:05:25,377 --> 01:05:26,378
Yeah!

1408
01:05:27,087 --> 01:05:28,964
I feel the same
about you guys.

1409
01:05:29,130 --> 01:05:31,466
So, I guess we're going to be
family after all.

1410
01:05:31,633 --> 01:05:33,802
Except for one tiny detail...

1411
01:05:33,969 --> 01:05:35,053
By stealing the ring,

1412
01:05:35,136 --> 01:05:37,222
we've effectively
ruined the proposal.

1413
01:05:37,389 --> 01:05:38,390
You're right.

1414
01:05:38,473 --> 01:05:41,726
We need to get that ring,
and get to that restaurant!

1415
01:05:41,893 --> 01:05:43,395
Let's do it. Come on.

1416
01:05:48,400 --> 01:05:50,318
Looks like Air Marshal Suggs

1417
01:05:50,402 --> 01:05:53,238
is gonna be checking into
the Shelborne Hotel.

1418
01:05:53,571 --> 01:05:54,572
Yes!

1419
01:05:54,739 --> 01:05:56,658
Time for a chip hunt!

1420
01:05:57,075 --> 01:05:58,410
I really
wanna go with you...

1421
01:05:58,743 --> 01:05:59,786
but I'm stuck babysitting.

1422
01:05:59,953 --> 01:06:00,996
Aw, man. The babysitter.

1423
01:06:01,162 --> 01:06:03,248
I hope when they get here,
they're not annoying.

1424
01:06:03,581 --> 01:06:05,083
Let's go.
Like, this last time...

1425
01:06:05,250 --> 01:06:07,294
I had a kid,
and he was, like...

1426
01:06:07,460 --> 01:06:09,421
"My gosh, can I have
yogurt?" And I was like...

1427
01:06:09,587 --> 01:06:11,047
"My gosh,
can you go to sleep?"

1428
01:06:11,131 --> 01:06:12,173
I don't think
she knows we're here.

1429
01:06:12,257 --> 01:06:13,341
I was like, "Ridiculous."

1430
01:06:13,425 --> 01:06:14,801
I don't think
she knows she's here.

1431
01:06:14,926 --> 01:06:17,470
This really sucks,
when you're so responsible,

1432
01:06:17,595 --> 01:06:19,639
and, like, everyone
around you is so not.

1433
01:06:19,806 --> 01:06:21,933
You know what I mean?
It's like, it's hard.

1434
01:06:22,100 --> 01:06:23,601
There you are.

1435
01:06:23,768 --> 01:06:25,020
Well, okay, I'm totally
texting you right now.

1436
01:06:25,186 --> 01:06:26,688
Hold on, let me
send you this picture.

1437
01:06:27,856 --> 01:06:29,858
He's, like, super cute.
I really like him.

1438
01:06:30,191 --> 01:06:31,776
Come on! Let's go.
Aw, I know.

1439
01:06:31,943 --> 01:06:33,945
What are you talking about?
I like that he's hairy.

1440
01:06:34,112 --> 01:06:35,613
Hairy, you say?

1441
01:06:35,780 --> 01:06:36,948
Yeah, scruffy's, like, cute.

1442
01:06:37,449 --> 01:06:41,161
It's like, "Hi, lam adorable,
but I'm also an animal."

1443
01:06:41,786 --> 01:06:43,121
You know? Yeah, I know.

1444
01:06:43,288 --> 01:06:45,123
Yeah, right. Miles!
We're on our way.

1445
01:06:45,290 --> 01:06:46,458
Yeah, I know he's
a little short, but

1446
01:06:46,541 --> 01:06:48,043
I don't know, you know
that famous saying...

1447
01:06:48,126 --> 01:06:49,461
Theo! Come on! Let's go!

1448
01:06:49,544 --> 01:06:50,879
"Little things come in big
packages," or whatever.

1449
01:06:50,962 --> 01:06:52,047
Man.
It's like that.

1450
01:06:52,964 --> 01:06:54,132
I think
she liked me.

1451
01:06:54,507 --> 01:06:55,675
I, like, could be
doing so many more

1452
01:06:55,800 --> 01:06:57,135
important things right now.

1453
01:06:57,302 --> 01:06:59,554
I could be, I don't know,
getting a pedicure?

1454
01:07:00,638 --> 01:07:03,224
I'm looking for
some chipmunks.

1455
01:07:05,977 --> 01:07:07,645
Guys, their reservation
was at 8:00.

1456
01:07:07,812 --> 01:07:10,315
So, we still might have time
to save the proposal.

1457
01:07:10,648 --> 01:07:12,275
Come on, let's go. Go!

1458
01:07:12,359 --> 01:07:13,360
Listen to me,

1459
01:07:13,485 --> 01:07:14,444
I know these chipmunks
are here.

1460
01:07:14,527 --> 01:07:16,029
This is a badge for the United
States government, okay?

1461
01:07:16,112 --> 01:07:17,072
Okay, guys,
here's the plan...

1462
01:07:17,155 --> 01:07:18,823
- So, I need for you...
- No. It's Suggs!

1463
01:07:19,240 --> 01:07:20,241
He found us.

1464
01:07:20,367 --> 01:07:22,243
Theodore, get up!

1465
01:07:22,660 --> 01:07:24,412
Miles, you gotta get
the ring to Dave!

1466
01:07:24,579 --> 01:07:25,705
I'm not leaving you guys.

1467
01:07:25,872 --> 01:07:27,415
We'll distract him. Just go!

1468
01:07:27,582 --> 01:07:28,583
Run, run!

1469
01:07:28,750 --> 01:07:29,876
Theo! Hurry!
Get back here!

1470
01:07:30,043 --> 01:07:31,711
I'm going
as fast as I can!

1471
01:07:31,878 --> 01:07:33,505
Think of donuts,
think of donuts!

1472
01:07:33,671 --> 01:07:35,507
Donuts? Whoo-hoo!

1473
01:07:35,882 --> 01:07:36,925
Go, Miles, go!
Hurry!

1474
01:07:37,092 --> 01:07:38,259
Run, run!

1475
01:07:38,426 --> 01:07:39,594
Hide over here!
Where?

1476
01:07:39,761 --> 01:07:41,763
I don't know!
Just think of something!

1477
01:07:50,355 --> 01:07:52,690
Come on. Where are you?

1478
01:07:53,233 --> 01:07:54,401
Where are you?

1479
01:07:58,530 --> 01:07:59,572
Come on.

1480
01:07:59,781 --> 01:08:02,117
Come on. Come on.

1481
01:08:15,296 --> 01:08:16,923
Hi...ya.

1482
01:08:17,257 --> 01:08:18,258
See ya!

1483
01:08:23,471 --> 01:08:24,514
Go, go, go!

1484
01:08:24,597 --> 01:08:25,640
Run, run!

1485
01:08:25,723 --> 01:08:27,767
Hurry, hurry! He's coming!

1486
01:08:28,726 --> 01:08:30,270
Hurry, Alvin. Hit the button!

1487
01:08:30,437 --> 01:08:32,063
Come on, Alvin! Hurry, hurry!

1488
01:08:34,649 --> 01:08:35,650
Ha!

1489
01:08:37,735 --> 01:08:40,655
Here's Suggsy!

1490
01:08:40,822 --> 01:08:42,157
He's like the Terminator!
Yeah!

1491
01:08:44,951 --> 01:08:45,952
No.

1492
01:08:46,161 --> 01:08:47,620
This is ironic.

1493
01:08:47,912 --> 01:08:49,622
We're gonna be going up...

1494
01:08:49,789 --> 01:08:52,125
but I'm taking you boys down.

1495
01:08:53,418 --> 01:08:55,753
Now, here's what's
gonna happen...

1496
01:08:56,588 --> 01:08:58,173
I'm gonna turn you over
to Homeland Security...

1497
01:08:58,339 --> 01:08:59,591
and they're gonna put you
in a zoo prison

1498
01:08:59,674 --> 01:09:00,800
for dangerous animals.

1499
01:09:00,925 --> 01:09:01,926
No.

1500
01:09:02,010 --> 01:09:03,970
And then, if you ever
get out of there...

1501
01:09:04,137 --> 01:09:06,139
I'm gonna pay someone to
have you stuffed.

1502
01:09:06,264 --> 01:09:07,223
Right.

1503
01:09:07,307 --> 01:09:09,517
And I'm gonna give you
as a gift to Anna,

1504
01:09:09,601 --> 01:09:11,352
who will hopefully
take me back.

1505
01:09:11,519 --> 01:09:14,147
Dude, I'm sorry,
but it's over.

1506
01:09:14,939 --> 01:09:16,107
You don't know that.
Theo, let's go.

1507
01:09:16,191 --> 01:09:17,567
I just think there's something
wrong with her phone

1508
01:09:17,650 --> 01:09:18,651
and she's not getting
my texts...

1509
01:09:18,776 --> 01:09:20,695
or the flowers,
or my candy grams.

1510
01:09:20,778 --> 01:09:22,447
And I, personally,
don't think it's uncommon...

1511
01:09:22,614 --> 01:09:23,656
for someone to move
five times a year

1512
01:09:23,781 --> 01:09:24,782
and change their number.

1513
01:09:24,866 --> 01:09:26,493
Okay? It's normal.

1514
01:09:26,868 --> 01:09:29,287
Yeah. Totally normal.

1515
01:09:29,454 --> 01:09:30,455
Alvin!

1516
01:09:30,538 --> 01:09:31,581
What? What's going on?

1517
01:09:31,664 --> 01:09:33,124
And that's our cue to leave.

1518
01:09:34,626 --> 01:09:35,960
It has been a treat.

1519
01:09:36,127 --> 01:09:37,212
No... What are you doing?

1520
01:09:37,378 --> 01:09:38,630
Elevator power off.

1521
01:09:39,130 --> 01:09:40,840
No! No!

1522
01:09:52,477 --> 01:09:53,478
Excuse me!

1523
01:09:53,645 --> 01:09:54,646
Pardon me!

1524
01:09:54,729 --> 01:09:55,730
Miles!

1525
01:09:56,064 --> 01:09:57,899
Hey. What happened to
Officer Dingleberry?

1526
01:09:58,066 --> 01:10:00,485
Let's just say
his elevator got stuck.

1527
01:10:00,652 --> 01:10:01,819
Has Dave proposed yet?

1528
01:10:02,320 --> 01:10:04,072
No, but they're on dessert.
It can't be long.

1529
01:10:04,239 --> 01:10:05,323
Excuse me. I'll be right back.

1530
01:10:05,406 --> 01:10:06,658
Okay.

1531
01:10:08,409 --> 01:10:09,410
You remember what to do?

1532
01:10:09,577 --> 01:10:10,662
Yes, sir. Be no problem.
There's the box.

1533
01:10:10,828 --> 01:10:12,664
It's go time.
Excuse me...

1534
01:10:12,830 --> 01:10:14,499
young man, we have a strict

1535
01:10:14,582 --> 01:10:16,501
no pets policy
at this restaurant.

1536
01:10:16,668 --> 01:10:18,920
I'm going to have to ask you
to take your meerkats home.

1537
01:10:19,087 --> 01:10:20,088
Meerkats!

1538
01:10:20,171 --> 01:10:21,172
Esteban.

1539
01:10:21,256 --> 01:10:23,925
Please escort these things
out of the restaurant.

1540
01:10:24,008 --> 01:10:25,385
All right, all right.

1541
01:10:25,552 --> 01:10:28,096
Come on, guys.
We know when we're not wanted.

1542
01:10:28,263 --> 01:10:30,181
Evasive maneuvers! Nutmeg!

1543
01:10:30,515 --> 01:10:31,808
He shoots, he scores!
Nice, Alvin!

1544
01:10:31,891 --> 01:10:33,142
Go, Alvin, go!

1545
01:10:33,226 --> 01:10:35,436
Did you hear that? It sounded
like somebody yelled "Alvin."

1546
01:10:35,520 --> 01:10:36,521
Alley-COP!

1547
01:10:37,772 --> 01:10:38,773
Whoo-hoo!

1548
01:10:39,232 --> 01:10:40,275
Pardon me!

1549
01:10:40,358 --> 01:10:41,401
I think you're imagining it.

1550
01:10:41,568 --> 01:10:42,819
- Alvin!
- I'm open!

1551
01:10:42,902 --> 01:10:43,945
Or not.

1552
01:10:59,294 --> 01:11:00,295
Gotcha!

1553
01:11:00,587 --> 01:11:01,921
Whoo-hoo! Cold!

1554
01:11:02,046 --> 01:11:03,715
Whoa!

1555
01:11:04,882 --> 01:11:05,883
Alvin?

1556
01:11:06,050 --> 01:11:07,885
Hi there, Dave.

1557
01:11:08,928 --> 01:11:11,306
Don't say it. Resist the urge.

1558
01:11:11,472 --> 01:11:13,725
We all know you wanna say it,
but hear me out.

1559
01:11:13,891 --> 01:11:15,268
Miles? What?

1560
01:11:15,393 --> 01:11:16,394
We can explain everything.

1561
01:11:16,477 --> 01:11:17,937
Well, I can't wait
to hear this.

1562
01:11:18,563 --> 01:11:19,606
Dave, we came to Miami

1563
01:11:19,731 --> 01:11:21,149
to stop you two
from getting engaged.

1564
01:11:22,817 --> 01:11:25,153
No.

1565
01:11:25,320 --> 01:11:27,822
I just blew the surprise.

1566
01:11:27,989 --> 01:11:30,575
But, and this is the part that
I'd like you to focus on...

1567
01:11:31,284 --> 01:11:33,161
when Theodore
got hit by a car...

1568
01:11:33,328 --> 01:11:34,746
Theodore got hit by a car?

1569
01:11:34,912 --> 01:11:35,913
I did.

1570
01:11:35,997 --> 01:11:38,458
He's fine. He was
saving Miles' life.

1571
01:11:38,625 --> 01:11:39,667
Wait, he what?

1572
01:11:40,126 --> 01:11:42,503
The point is,
we realized that...

1573
01:11:42,670 --> 01:11:45,006
we like the idea of
you two being together,

1574
01:11:45,089 --> 01:11:46,674
and we changed our minds.

1575
01:11:46,758 --> 01:11:47,759
Yep.

1576
01:11:48,426 --> 01:11:49,969
It might not be
the family in the photo

1577
01:11:50,094 --> 01:11:51,471
that comes with the frame...

1578
01:11:51,638 --> 01:11:55,099
but it's gonna be our family.
And we're proud of it.

1579
01:11:56,017 --> 01:11:57,935
Guys, that ring isn't mine.

1580
01:11:58,102 --> 01:12:01,147
So, you're not proposing?

1581
01:12:02,649 --> 01:12:05,026
I'm sorry, Samantha. I'm not.

1582
01:12:05,193 --> 01:12:06,277
Thank God.

1583
01:12:06,819 --> 01:12:07,987
I mean,
that's not what I meant.

1584
01:12:08,154 --> 01:12:09,280
You know. I mean, not that

1585
01:12:09,364 --> 01:12:10,490
I couldn't see it
happening someday.

1586
01:12:10,657 --> 01:12:12,408
I mean... Not that
I'm expecting it to happen.

1587
01:12:12,492 --> 01:12:13,951
But I mean,
if it did happen...

1588
01:12:14,118 --> 01:12:15,536
I'm spiraling, aren't I?

1589
01:12:15,703 --> 01:12:17,372
A little.
What I mean is...

1590
01:12:18,289 --> 01:12:22,043
I would love it if we could
just take our time because...

1591
01:12:22,210 --> 01:12:24,379
I really want it to work.

1592
01:12:25,338 --> 01:12:26,381
Me, too.

1593
01:12:27,965 --> 01:12:30,134
I'm very
confused right now.

1594
01:12:30,468 --> 01:12:32,470
You brought this ring to Miami

1595
01:12:32,553 --> 01:12:35,306
and you said you had to
come to dinner, so...

1596
01:12:35,473 --> 01:12:37,475
I was holding it for Barry.

1597
01:12:37,642 --> 01:12:39,143
My sound engineer.

1598
01:12:39,394 --> 01:12:41,229
He's proposing to
his girlfriend, Alice,

1599
01:12:41,312 --> 01:12:42,730
at the restaurant right now...

1600
01:12:42,897 --> 01:12:44,691
with an empty ring box.
My God.

1601
01:12:44,857 --> 01:12:45,858
Will you marry me?

1602
01:12:46,025 --> 01:12:48,361
It's not empty.

1603
01:12:53,533 --> 01:12:54,659
A breath mint?

1604
01:13:10,216 --> 01:13:11,384
Miss Grey, over here.

1605
01:13:11,509 --> 01:13:12,593
When are you
going back on tour?

1606
01:13:13,219 --> 01:13:15,513
The greenroom is
right this way, Mr. Seville.

1607
01:13:17,849 --> 01:13:19,142
The only reason
we're not headed

1608
01:13:19,225 --> 01:13:20,518
back to LA right now
is because...

1609
01:13:20,685 --> 01:13:22,019
I have to be here.

1610
01:13:22,186 --> 01:13:25,189
As soon as the show is over,
we're all going home.

1611
01:13:27,400 --> 01:13:28,943
I don't think I've ever been
more disappointed

1612
01:13:29,026 --> 01:13:30,695
in you guys
than I am right now.

1613
01:13:35,408 --> 01:13:37,660
If Dave didn't wanna
get rid of us before,

1614
01:13:37,744 --> 01:13:39,287
he definitely does now.

1615
01:13:39,537 --> 01:13:42,623
All because we only cared
about if we were happy.

1616
01:13:42,790 --> 01:13:45,042
Maybe it's a chipmunk thing,
like hoarding, you know?

1617
01:13:45,209 --> 01:13:46,878
Maybe we're
emotional hoarders?

1618
01:13:47,044 --> 01:13:48,337
Actually, chipmunks are

1619
01:13:48,421 --> 01:13:50,047
traditionally
very caring creatures.

1620
01:13:50,214 --> 01:13:53,092
Nuts.
Well, that means it's us.

1621
01:13:53,259 --> 01:13:55,219
I'd do anything to fix this.

1622
01:13:56,053 --> 01:13:59,223
Wait. Maybe we can fix it.

1623
01:13:59,390 --> 01:14:01,893
By doing the one thing
we do best!

1624
01:14:02,059 --> 01:14:03,561
Cause mischief on
land, sea and air?

1625
01:14:03,728 --> 01:14:04,896
Eat all of Dave's food?

1626
01:14:05,062 --> 01:14:06,564
No! Music!

1627
01:14:06,731 --> 01:14:08,566
When words aren't enough,
we sing!

1628
01:14:08,733 --> 01:14:10,735
So let's give Dave
onelastsong

1629
01:14:10,818 --> 01:14:13,237
to show him
how we really feel about him.

1630
01:14:13,404 --> 01:14:15,615
Miles, start working on
that little country riff

1631
01:14:15,740 --> 01:14:16,824
you were doing in Texas.

1632
01:14:16,908 --> 01:14:18,659
Where are you going?
There's so much to do.

1633
01:14:18,826 --> 01:14:20,161
I need to talk to Wardrobe,
we need to...

1634
01:14:20,328 --> 01:14:21,788
If we are gonna
bring down the house,

1635
01:14:21,913 --> 01:14:23,664
we're gonna need some backup.

1636
01:14:30,922 --> 01:14:32,131
Boy.

1637
01:14:34,467 --> 01:14:35,760
Okay.

1638
01:14:43,351 --> 01:14:44,352
Ooh!

1639
01:14:47,355 --> 01:14:49,774
Um, well...

1640
01:14:49,941 --> 01:14:51,192
You're going to Hollywood!

1641
01:14:51,484 --> 01:14:53,110
Alvin!

1642
01:14:53,486 --> 01:14:55,780
I'm going to Hollywood!
I'm going to Hollywood!

1643
01:14:55,947 --> 01:14:57,990
Sorry, girls, I've always
wanted to say that.

1644
01:14:58,157 --> 01:14:59,951
What are you doing here?
Yeah.

1645
01:15:00,284 --> 01:15:02,161
We're kind of in
the middle of auditions.

1646
01:15:02,328 --> 01:15:03,454
I need your help.

1647
01:15:03,621 --> 01:15:06,874
We really screwed up with Dave
and we gotta fix it.

1648
01:15:08,459 --> 01:15:10,670
Because it's for Dave,
we're in.

1649
01:15:11,295 --> 01:15:12,797
<i>Please
give a warm welcome...</i>

1650
01:15:12,964 --> 01:15:14,799
<i>for Miss Ashley Grey!</i>

1651
01:15:21,848 --> 01:15:23,057
<i>Thank you, GUYS-</i>

1652
01:15:23,391 --> 01:15:25,643
<i>Now, I have a very special
surprise for you...</i>

1653
01:15:25,810 --> 01:15:29,480
<i>which was a surprise to me
as well until just now.</i>

1654
01:15:30,189 --> 01:15:32,525
<i>Everybody, welcome
The Chipmunks!</i>

1655
01:15:35,486 --> 01:15:36,487
Thanks, Ashley.

1656
01:15:36,571 --> 01:15:38,406
Thanks.
Thank you.

1657
01:15:39,156 --> 01:15:40,157
Um...

1658
01:15:40,575 --> 01:15:42,243
Before we perform,

1659
01:15:42,326 --> 01:15:45,204
my brothers and I have
a few things to set straight.

1660
01:15:45,830 --> 01:15:46,831
Earlier this evening...

1661
01:15:46,998 --> 01:15:50,710
we accidentally ruined
a very special evening...

1662
01:15:50,877 --> 01:15:52,879
for a very special woman

1663
01:15:53,004 --> 01:15:54,797
and we'd like to
make it up to her.

1664
01:15:54,881 --> 01:15:55,923
Yeah.

1665
01:15:56,007 --> 01:15:57,049
Alice?

1666
01:15:57,216 --> 01:15:59,176
Barry has something
he'd like to ask you.

1667
01:15:59,343 --> 01:16:00,344
Again.

1668
01:16:05,683 --> 01:16:07,184
Will you marry me this time?

1669
01:16:07,852 --> 01:16:08,895
Yes.

1670
01:16:09,186 --> 01:16:10,187
Aw.

1671
01:16:10,271 --> 01:16:11,606
Yes.

1672
01:16:16,193 --> 01:16:17,403
Thanks, Chipmunks.

1673
01:16:18,195 --> 01:16:21,365
And we just had one more
quick thing to say.

1674
01:16:21,532 --> 01:16:22,783
Dave“.

1675
01:16:22,950 --> 01:16:24,577
We're really sorry.
We're sorry.

1676
01:16:25,703 --> 01:16:27,872
So we wrote this
last song for you.

1677
01:17:12,131 --> 01:17:13,799
Whoo!
Wow!

1678
01:17:37,614 --> 01:17:39,324
Please welcome The Chipettes!

1679
01:17:44,955 --> 01:17:45,914
Wow.

1680
01:18:10,981 --> 01:18:12,816
Whoo!

1681
01:18:47,100 --> 01:18:48,769
I love you, Dave!

1682
01:19:06,870 --> 01:19:08,247
Thank you.
Nailed it.

1683
01:19:08,413 --> 01:19:09,748
Thank you!

1684
01:19:09,915 --> 01:19:10,958
Thank you, my 990N9-

1685
01:19:12,918 --> 01:19:14,086
We still got it.

1686
01:19:14,638 --> 01:19:16,223
Yeah! Whoo!

1687
01:19:16,389 --> 01:19:17,724
Girls, thank you.

1688
01:19:17,891 --> 01:19:19,226
We owe you one.

1689
01:19:19,392 --> 01:19:22,562
You owe us way more than one,
but, you're welcome.

1690
01:19:22,729 --> 01:19:25,023
Guys, we have to
get back to auditions.

1691
01:19:25,106 --> 01:19:27,567
Ryan's been
texting me like crazy.

1692
01:19:27,734 --> 01:19:30,153
Come on, girls. Let's roll.

1693
01:19:31,112 --> 01:19:33,448
Bye, Theodore-able.

1694
01:19:35,951 --> 01:19:38,245
Miles, that was amazing!

1695
01:19:38,787 --> 01:19:40,747
Dave, we're so sorry

1696
01:19:40,831 --> 01:19:43,083
we came to Miami
without telling you.

1697
01:19:43,250 --> 01:19:45,418
We just didn't wanna lose you.

1698
01:19:45,752 --> 01:19:46,753
Lose me?

1699
01:19:46,920 --> 01:19:48,755
Why would you guys ever think
you were gonna lose me?

1700
01:19:48,922 --> 01:19:50,757
Because you said
you're starting

1701
01:19:50,841 --> 01:19:52,300
a new chapter in your life.

1702
01:19:52,467 --> 01:19:54,761
We thought you might
bail on us.

1703
01:19:54,928 --> 01:19:56,972
Technically,
we're not even a family.

1704
01:19:57,138 --> 01:19:58,932
We're just three chipmunks
who live with you.

1705
01:19:59,683 --> 01:20:01,601
Is that what you guys think?

1706
01:20:02,102 --> 01:20:03,311
I mean, I know I haven't

1707
01:20:03,436 --> 01:20:05,272
really been around much
lately, and...

1708
01:20:05,438 --> 01:20:07,107
things are changing for us,

1709
01:20:07,190 --> 01:20:08,942
but I'd never
bail on you guys.

1710
01:20:09,317 --> 01:20:11,111
Because we are a family.

1711
01:20:11,820 --> 01:20:13,864
You're stuck with me
whether you like it or not.

1712
01:20:16,449 --> 01:20:18,451
And I was probably
a little over-the-top

1713
01:20:18,535 --> 01:20:20,620
on the whole
"no music" thing, okay?

1714
01:20:20,787 --> 01:20:22,497
You guys can perform.
All right!

1715
01:20:22,664 --> 01:20:24,165
But locally. Okay?

1716
01:20:24,332 --> 01:20:25,333
Sure!

1717
01:20:25,625 --> 01:20:28,295
And I promise to be a better
dad from here on out.

1718
01:20:28,461 --> 01:20:30,630
What are you
talking about, Dave?

1719
01:20:30,797 --> 01:20:33,800
You're the best dad
we could ever have.

1720
01:20:35,051 --> 01:20:36,511
What do you say to
a little family dinner

1721
01:20:36,636 --> 01:20:37,721
when we get home?

1722
01:20:37,888 --> 01:20:39,306
You know, so we know where

1723
01:20:39,389 --> 01:20:41,057
our kids are the entire time
we're together?

1724
01:20:41,224 --> 01:20:42,434
That sounds perfect.

1725
01:20:42,517 --> 01:20:43,894
Whoo-hoo! We rocked it!

1726
01:20:43,977 --> 01:20:47,314
Simon, did you see me?
I was on fire!.

1727
01:20:47,480 --> 01:20:49,107
I can't believe
I'm saying this,

1728
01:20:49,190 --> 01:20:50,984
but I had fun getting
in trouble with you guys.

1729
01:20:51,151 --> 01:20:52,736
The trip might be over,

1730
01:20:52,819 --> 01:20:54,237
but as long as
Alvin is around,

1731
01:20:54,321 --> 01:20:55,822
we'll always get into trouble.

1732
01:20:55,989 --> 01:20:57,657
Thanks,SH
Not a compliment.

1733
01:20:57,991 --> 01:21:00,076
My God,
you guys were awesome.

1734
01:21:00,702 --> 01:21:01,703
Hey, Miles, right?

1735
01:21:02,829 --> 01:21:04,372
WOW, you played great!

1736
01:21:04,539 --> 01:21:06,082
Thanks! Your cool song...

1737
01:21:06,249 --> 01:21:10,420
I mean... I love when...
Music with your mouth...

1738
01:21:10,587 --> 01:21:12,047
Brother....

1739
01:21:13,256 --> 01:21:15,008
You're great.
Thank you.

1740
01:21:15,175 --> 01:21:16,343
She bought it.

1741
01:21:16,509 --> 01:21:18,303
Anyways, I have this party

1742
01:21:18,386 --> 01:21:20,764
I'm supposed to go to
in L.A. Saturday night...

1743
01:21:20,931 --> 01:21:21,973
if, um, maybe you'd wanna...

1744
01:21:22,057 --> 01:21:23,058
Definitely, yeah.

1745
01:21:23,224 --> 01:21:24,434
I'd, definitely
would like to...

1746
01:21:24,601 --> 01:21:26,019
Yes. Definitely.

1747
01:21:26,186 --> 01:21:28,063
Okay. Well then
I'll definitely,

1748
01:21:28,188 --> 01:21:29,940
definitely see you there.

1749
01:21:30,106 --> 01:21:31,107
Okay.

1750
01:21:31,691 --> 01:21:33,234
Bye.
Bye.

1751
01:21:33,860 --> 01:21:35,612
Smooth, Miles.

1752
01:21:36,404 --> 01:21:37,864
Real smooth.

1753
01:21:38,031 --> 01:21:39,199
Bye.

1754
01:21:40,033 --> 01:21:41,284
All right!
Hey, ready?

1755
01:21:41,451 --> 01:21:42,452
Yeah.

1756
01:21:42,619 --> 01:21:43,620
Bye, guys.

1757
01:21:45,288 --> 01:21:46,873
Come on, guys. Let's go home.

1758
01:21:47,874 --> 01:21:50,543
Should we remind him we're
on the No-Fly List?

1759
01:21:50,961 --> 01:21:52,545
Definitely not.

1760
01:22:08,436 --> 01:22:10,188
Um,
this doesn't look like home.

1761
01:22:10,271 --> 01:22:11,272
It's not.

1762
01:22:11,398 --> 01:22:12,399
We have one more
important thing

1763
01:22:12,482 --> 01:22:13,775
to do before we go home.

1764
01:22:13,942 --> 01:22:16,444
Dave, we've been
driving for three days!

1765
01:22:16,611 --> 01:22:17,612
Can't it wait?

1766
01:22:17,779 --> 01:22:19,197
Unfortunately not, boys.

1767
01:22:19,280 --> 01:22:20,657
The courthouse
is closed tomorrow.

1768
01:22:21,157 --> 01:22:22,742
I'm sorry, the what house?

1769
01:22:23,576 --> 01:22:25,078
Are we going to jail?

1770
01:22:25,245 --> 01:22:26,955
We didn't mean to cause an
emergency landing, Dave!

1771
01:22:27,122 --> 01:22:28,581
It was freezing in cargo!

1772
01:22:29,124 --> 01:22:32,585
Does this look like a face
that will survive prison?

1773
01:22:34,462 --> 01:22:35,588
Come on.

1774
01:22:37,674 --> 01:22:38,717
Dave Seville?

1775
01:22:38,800 --> 01:22:39,801
Yep, that's me.

1776
01:22:40,343 --> 01:22:41,344
By signing this...

1777
01:22:41,428 --> 01:22:43,763
you not only agree
to take care of,

1778
01:22:43,847 --> 01:22:45,140
but to provide for the health,

1779
01:22:45,265 --> 01:22:46,683
welfare and
educafionalneedsu.

1780
01:22:46,850 --> 01:22:48,601
Of Alvin, Simon and Theodore.

1781
01:22:49,144 --> 01:22:50,145
I do.

1782
01:22:50,311 --> 01:22:52,939
Alvin, Simon and Theodore,
do you agree to this adoption?

1783
01:22:53,106 --> 01:22:54,274
Adoption?

1784
01:22:54,607 --> 01:22:56,651
That's why we're here?

1785
01:22:57,610 --> 01:22:59,779
You're adopting us?

1786
01:22:59,946 --> 01:23:00,989
You guys were right.

1787
01:23:01,614 --> 01:23:04,034
Even though you consider me
to be your dad, and...

1788
01:23:04,200 --> 01:23:06,661
I love you like my own sons,
it's never been official.

1789
01:23:06,828 --> 01:23:08,496
So I figured...

1790
01:23:08,663 --> 01:23:10,290
let's make it official.

1791
01:23:17,464 --> 01:23:18,465
Chipmunks?

1792
01:23:18,798 --> 01:23:19,799
Yes?

1793
01:23:21,468 --> 01:23:24,095
I still need you to say
something like "I agree."

1794
01:23:24,179 --> 01:23:25,472
Just to make it legal.

1795
01:23:26,473 --> 01:23:28,558
Yeah! I agree!

1796
01:23:29,142 --> 01:23:30,643
Yeah. Me, too!

1797
01:23:30,810 --> 01:23:32,103
1,000%!

1798
01:23:32,187 --> 01:23:33,438
And that's not even
a real number.

1799
01:23:34,856 --> 01:23:37,150
Does this mean we're Sevilles?

1800
01:23:38,151 --> 01:23:39,652
On this day...

1801
01:23:39,819 --> 01:23:41,571
David Seville has
officially adopted

1802
01:23:41,654 --> 01:23:44,032
Alvin, Simon and Theodore
to be his children.

1803
01:23:44,365 --> 01:23:45,950
You three now have
all the legal rights

1804
01:23:46,034 --> 01:23:47,160
of any natural child.

1805
01:23:47,327 --> 01:23:48,495
Or, chipmunk.

1806
01:23:49,496 --> 01:23:53,166
I hereby sign this order
confirming this adoption.

1807
01:23:53,249 --> 01:23:54,292
Congratulations.

1808
01:23:54,375 --> 01:23:55,376
Thank you.

1809
01:23:55,502 --> 01:23:56,503
Whoo-hoo!
Yay!

1810
01:23:58,088 --> 01:23:59,839
This is amazing! Yes!

1811
01:24:00,006 --> 01:24:01,549
GUYS, guys... Just...

1812
01:24:01,841 --> 01:24:03,510
Up high, Judge. Give me some.

1813
01:24:03,676 --> 01:24:04,969
Whoo-hoo! I'm so happy!
Awesome!

1814
01:24:05,053 --> 01:24:06,054
Dave!
Whoa!

1815
01:24:06,179 --> 01:24:07,222
Sweet!

1816
01:24:07,388 --> 01:24:08,431
Yes! We're a family!

1817
01:24:08,598 --> 01:24:09,724
We have a dad. Legally.

1818
01:24:09,891 --> 01:24:11,059
Okay.

1819
01:24:11,226 --> 01:24:12,352
Okay, all right. Alvin, okay.

1820
01:24:12,519 --> 01:24:13,645
What an amazing day!

1821
01:24:14,896 --> 01:24:16,523
They're excited.
Yes!

1822
01:24:22,862 --> 01:24:24,364
Hey, official and legal Dad?

1823
01:24:24,531 --> 01:24:26,199
Yes, official and legal son?

1824
01:24:26,366 --> 01:24:29,744
Thanks for being the best
official and legal dad, Dad.

1825
01:24:29,911 --> 01:24:32,455
Well, you three are the best
official and legal sons

1826
01:24:32,539 --> 01:24:34,582
an official and legal father
could ask for.

1827
01:24:34,749 --> 01:24:37,085
Aw. That's sweet
of you to say, Dad.

1828
01:24:37,252 --> 01:24:38,253
Yeah.

1829
01:24:38,795 --> 01:24:41,548
But seriously, guys, this is
the happiest day of my life.

1830
01:24:41,714 --> 01:24:43,883
Literally nothing
could ruin it for me.

1831
01:24:49,055 --> 01:24:50,723
Boy.

1832
01:24:50,974 --> 01:24:52,725
Alvin.

1833
01:24:52,892 --> 01:24:55,228
Totally forgot about this.

1834
01:25:01,067 --> 01:25:03,820
Alvin!

1835
01:25:18,126 --> 01:25:19,669
Which way is the pool?

1836
01:25:22,797 --> 01:25:24,424
Thank you.

1837
01:25:34,934 --> 01:25:36,269
<i>Got some bad news, muchacho.</i>

1838
01:25:36,936 --> 01:25:40,190
The chairs are for
hotel guests only. Beat it.

1839
01:25:40,315 --> 01:25:41,316
Okay.

1840
01:25:41,441 --> 01:25:43,526
I got some bad news
for you, too, muchacho.

1841
01:25:43,693 --> 01:25:44,694
I'm not moving.

1842
01:25:44,777 --> 01:25:46,112
I was just stuck
in your elevator of death

1843
01:25:46,196 --> 01:25:47,363
for hours and
I'm probably out of a job...

1844
01:25:47,530 --> 01:25:48,865
so I'm gonna sit in this chair

1845
01:25:48,948 --> 01:25:50,992
by this pool,
and I'm gonna relax.

1846
01:25:51,159 --> 01:25:52,202
And if you got
a problem with it,

1847
01:25:52,285 --> 01:25:53,953
you can carry me out.

1848
01:25:54,120 --> 01:25:56,956
You can carry me out!
Carry me out! Go for it!

1849
01:25:57,123 --> 01:25:58,625
Yes, sir.
Go for it!

1850
01:25:59,959 --> 01:26:01,002
<i>EOh</i>

1851
01:26:02,378 --> 01:26:03,630
That's him. That's the guy.

1852
01:26:03,796 --> 01:26:05,632
Come on! Come on.

1853
01:26:05,798 --> 01:26:07,342
What are you gonna do,
carry me out? Really?

1854
01:26:07,467 --> 01:26:09,052
Okay, you are gonna
carry me out. Okay!

1855
01:26:09,219 --> 01:26:10,220
Okay, this is fine!

1856
01:26:10,386 --> 01:26:12,305
I've been looking
to relax all day!

1857
01:26:12,472 --> 01:26:14,015
I'm like Cleopatra!

1858
01:26:14,182 --> 01:26:15,183
Floating away!

1859
01:26:15,350 --> 01:26:17,060
I'm gonna chillax!

1860
01:26:17,143 --> 01:26:19,437
<i>T He)', hey, hey!</i>

1861
01:27:32,308 --> 01:27:36,061
<i>T He)', hey, hey!</i>
