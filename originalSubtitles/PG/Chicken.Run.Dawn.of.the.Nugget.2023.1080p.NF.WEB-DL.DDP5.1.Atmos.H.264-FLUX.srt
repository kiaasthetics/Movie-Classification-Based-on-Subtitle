1
00:00:18,125 --> 00:00:20,041
<i>Hey. How you doin' in there?</i>

2
00:00:20,708 --> 00:00:23,375
<i>You sitting comfortably?
All settled in? Okay, good.</i>

3
00:00:23,916 --> 00:00:25,083
<i>Now, listen.</i>

4
00:00:25,916 --> 00:00:28,000
<i>I'm gonna tell you a story.</i>

5
00:00:28,541 --> 00:00:32,166
<i>It's all about the time
we escaped from a chicken farm.</i>

6
00:00:33,791 --> 00:00:35,208
<i>There was this farmer, see?</i>

7
00:00:35,291 --> 00:00:38,916
<i>And she absolutely hated chickens.</i>

8
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,750
<i>Kept them locked up
like prisoners.</i>

9
00:00:40,833 --> 00:00:44,541
<i>I guess you could say
she had a real</i> axe <i>to grind.</i>

10
00:00:44,625 --> 00:00:47,625
<i>Got herself a machine
that turned chickens into pies.</i>

11
00:00:48,666 --> 00:00:50,125
We mustn't panic!

12
00:00:53,333 --> 00:00:56,333
<i>But what she didn't plan on
was going toe to toe</i>

13
00:00:56,416 --> 00:00:59,333
<i>with a certain freedom-fighting chick.</i>

14
00:00:59,416 --> 00:01:03,708
<i>She was fierce, fearless,
and wanted one thing and one thing only.</i>

15
00:01:03,791 --> 00:01:05,041
Freedom.

16
00:01:06,250 --> 00:01:07,791
<i>She pulled us all together...</i>

17
00:01:09,041 --> 00:01:12,000
<i>...and gave us the wings
to fly right outta that hen-hole.</i>

18
00:01:12,083 --> 00:01:14,958
<i>She got every chicken out of there.</i>

19
00:01:15,041 --> 00:01:17,875
<i>And got rid of that wicked farmer
to boot.</i>

20
00:01:17,958 --> 00:01:19,000
Huh?

21
00:01:19,083 --> 00:01:20,916
Bye-bye.

22
00:01:23,791 --> 00:01:26,111
And you know
who that freedom-fighting chicken was?

23
00:01:27,291 --> 00:01:29,333
Your very own mom.

24
00:01:29,416 --> 00:01:34,916
Rocky, don't you think bedtime stories
might be a bit premature?

25
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:39,375
Well... I mean, you're never too young
to learn where you came from.

26
00:01:42,625 --> 00:01:45,041
But those days are over, thank goodness.

27
00:01:46,083 --> 00:01:47,916
We've got our happy ending.

28
00:01:48,416 --> 00:01:49,750
We're living in it.

29
00:01:52,875 --> 00:01:54,250
Your way, Mac.

30
00:01:54,333 --> 00:01:56,083
More fruit coming, Bunty.

31
00:01:56,166 --> 00:02:00,833
Oh! Oh, thanks, Mac,
'cause I'm working up a thirst here.

32
00:02:00,916 --> 00:02:04,541
Good work, Bunty. Keep it up.

33
00:02:04,625 --> 00:02:05,791
You know what?

34
00:02:06,791 --> 00:02:09,291
I think it's time
to put the past behind us.

35
00:02:09,375 --> 00:02:12,708
- Turned out nice again.
- Ooh, yeah. Lovely.

36
00:02:13,208 --> 00:02:14,375
Past?

37
00:02:14,458 --> 00:02:15,916
What past?

38
00:02:16,791 --> 00:02:19,791
<i>That</i> past, behind us.

39
00:02:21,416 --> 00:02:24,000
But these,
these are our glory days.

40
00:02:24,083 --> 00:02:25,750
That's who we are.

41
00:02:25,833 --> 00:02:27,458
It's who we <i>were.</i>

42
00:02:27,958 --> 00:02:31,125
We went through all that
so our baby doesn't have to.

43
00:02:32,541 --> 00:02:35,958
Y'know, you are right.

44
00:02:37,666 --> 00:02:41,500
From now on,
our only mission is to keep our baby safe.

45
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,916
Don't you worry.
Ol' Rocky here is on the case.

46
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,833
What do I do? What do I do?

47
00:02:48,916 --> 00:02:50,375
- Whoo-hoo!
- It's hopping!

48
00:02:50,458 --> 00:02:51,625
Just grab it!

49
00:02:51,708 --> 00:02:53,000
Whee!

50
00:02:54,416 --> 00:02:56,625
Oh no!

51
00:02:56,708 --> 00:02:57,916
Whoops!

52
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Egg's up!

53
00:02:59,083 --> 00:03:00,875
Good grief. A live shell.

54
00:03:00,958 --> 00:03:02,958
Clear the area!

55
00:03:03,041 --> 00:03:05,361
- Whoo-hoo!
- Oh! Get it!

56
00:03:05,416 --> 00:03:06,875
- Watch out!
- Huh?

57
00:03:06,958 --> 00:03:08,500
{\an8}No!

58
00:03:24,333 --> 00:03:25,416
Would you look at that.

59
00:03:27,291 --> 00:03:29,166
We've got ourselves a family.

60
00:03:29,250 --> 00:03:30,125
Huh?

61
00:03:30,208 --> 00:03:32,583
Oh, look at her, Rocky.

62
00:03:33,083 --> 00:03:36,291
She's perfect.

63
00:03:36,875 --> 00:03:38,791
Welcome to the world.

64
00:03:41,708 --> 00:03:43,208
- Molly.
- Mm.

65
00:03:43,291 --> 00:03:46,000
Ah, what a bonny wee hen.

66
00:03:46,083 --> 00:03:49,750
Oh, she's got
her father's spindly little legs.

67
00:03:49,833 --> 00:03:51,500
We need to build them up, what, what.

68
00:03:52,083 --> 00:03:56,625
When I was in the RAF,
we did 50 squats before breakfast.

69
00:03:56,708 --> 00:03:58,916
Ah. Oh.

70
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,083
That's gone.

71
00:04:00,166 --> 00:04:02,625
- I made her a bicycle.
- Really?

72
00:04:02,708 --> 00:04:04,041
Mm-hmm.

73
00:04:04,541 --> 00:04:06,375
Oh. You knitted one.

74
00:04:06,458 --> 00:04:09,083
What a lovely... thought.

75
00:04:09,833 --> 00:04:11,416
Thank you, Babs.

76
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:17,208
Y'know, I'd say our little island paradise
just got a little more

77
00:04:18,208 --> 00:04:19,916
"paradisier."

78
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:24,916

Hi, Mum.

131
00:07:09,250 --> 00:07:12,666
- Oh. Hello, darling.
- Hi, Dad!

132
00:07:12,750 --> 00:07:14,916
Uncle Nick! Uncle Fetcher!

133
00:07:15,458 --> 00:07:18,041
She just called me "uncle."

134
00:07:18,125 --> 00:07:20,291
Steady, mate. Steady.

135
00:07:20,375 --> 00:07:22,958
But I've never had
a family of me own.

136
00:07:23,041 --> 00:07:24,083
Me neither.

137
00:07:26,833 --> 00:07:31,291
Mum, I was thinking. Can we go over there?

138
00:07:31,375 --> 00:07:32,250
Where, love?

139
00:07:32,333 --> 00:07:34,208
The other side of the water.

140
00:07:43,708 --> 00:07:46,833
Oh, we've spoken about this, Molly.

141
00:07:46,916 --> 00:07:49,416
There's nothing over there for us.

142
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:51,458
What about stuff Uncle Nick
and Fetch bring?

143
00:07:52,041 --> 00:07:53,875
Isn't that for us?

144
00:07:53,958 --> 00:07:55,583
Hey. What's up, Ginge?

145
00:07:55,666 --> 00:07:57,500
Rocky.

146
00:07:57,583 --> 00:08:01,375
Molly's asking about <i>going off the island.</i>

147
00:08:01,458 --> 00:08:02,458
Oh, right.

148
00:08:02,875 --> 00:08:04,416
<i>Oh,</i> right.

149
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:06,291
Hey, Molly.

150
00:08:06,375 --> 00:08:09,041
Do you wanna see
the world's coolest invention?

151
00:08:09,833 --> 00:08:11,166
Hmm.

152
00:08:12,875 --> 00:08:13,791
Okay.

153
00:08:19,333 --> 00:08:21,666
What is it, Dad?

154
00:08:22,875 --> 00:08:25,500
Only the answer to all of life's problems.

155
00:08:26,541 --> 00:08:27,875
Popcorn.

156
00:08:28,750 --> 00:08:30,125
Mm!

157
00:08:30,208 --> 00:08:34,250
Is that the best thing ever or what?

158
00:08:34,333 --> 00:08:37,916
- Mm! It <i>is</i> good.
- "Good"?

159
00:08:38,416 --> 00:08:40,000
This is <i>great</i>!

160
00:08:42,375 --> 00:08:46,458
Life, my girl,
doesn't get better than this.

161
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:06,000
- Mum, what is it?
- It's nothing to worry about, Molly.

162
00:09:07,166 --> 00:09:08,416
Nothing at all.

163
00:09:22,041 --> 00:09:26,000
Well, it was only a matter of time
before the humans showed up.

164
00:09:28,875 --> 00:09:32,791
It looks like they're taking them
to some kind of chicken farm.

165
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,041
Uh-oh.

166
00:09:37,125 --> 00:09:40,166
I haven't seen that look in a long while.

167
00:09:40,958 --> 00:09:44,791
You can't right
all the world's wrongs, duck.

168
00:09:44,875 --> 00:09:47,416
Meeting tonight. Spread the word.

169
00:09:47,916 --> 00:09:50,166
Here we go again.

170
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:58,125
What's going on, Mum?

171
00:09:58,208 --> 00:10:01,958
Why can't I go up my tree anymore?
What's this meeting about?

172
00:10:02,041 --> 00:10:04,125
It's nothing, Molly.

173
00:10:04,208 --> 00:10:06,416
It's, um, just...

174
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:09,875
There's some quite big wasps
up there this year.

175
00:10:09,958 --> 00:10:11,666
Really?

176
00:10:11,750 --> 00:10:16,083
Besides, I need someone to stay here
and look after your dad.

177
00:10:21,375 --> 00:10:23,375
Don't worry. I'm good.

178
00:10:23,458 --> 00:10:25,416
Okay.

179
00:10:26,041 --> 00:10:28,708
Maybe while you're out,
he can tell me a story.

180
00:10:28,791 --> 00:10:29,875
Good idea.

181
00:10:30,833 --> 00:10:33,083
Good night, my big, brave girl.

182
00:10:36,875 --> 00:10:39,416
Good night, Ginge. Good luck.

183
00:10:40,875 --> 00:10:43,333
Okay, Mollypod. What do you wanna do?

184
00:10:43,416 --> 00:10:49,041
Well, I thought
you could tell me about... this.

185
00:10:49,541 --> 00:10:51,833
Oh!

186
00:10:51,916 --> 00:10:56,291
Uh, uh, uh, that... that is... not me.

187
00:11:02,583 --> 00:11:07,625
{\an8}Okay. Yes, it's me.
But it was a long time ago.

188
00:11:08,625 --> 00:11:09,875
And?

189
00:11:10,375 --> 00:11:11,375
And,

190
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:13,750
actually,

191
00:11:14,666 --> 00:11:17,291
it's a... it's a pretty good story.

192
00:11:19,250 --> 00:11:21,083
It's not just eggs
they want from us.

193
00:11:21,166 --> 00:11:23,083
Ginger has that look about her.

194
00:11:23,166 --> 00:11:26,416
I reckon she'll have us charging
right into the fray.

195
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:29,000
I don't want to charge into any frays.

196
00:11:29,083 --> 00:11:30,500
I... I'm fray-phobic.

197
00:11:30,583 --> 00:11:34,416
- All right, everyone! Please, quiet!
- Wait. She's starting.

198
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:36,250
- Quiet!
- Shut your beak.

199
00:11:36,333 --> 00:11:39,750
Now, we all know about the new road.

200
00:11:42,125 --> 00:11:47,083
And the trucks taking chickens
to what looks like some kind of farm.

201
00:11:47,166 --> 00:11:49,333
A farm?

202
00:11:49,416 --> 00:11:51,916
No, it's all right, Beryl. Listen. Listen.

203
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:55,208
We know from experience
what that can mean.

204
00:11:56,208 --> 00:11:58,791
It's something we just can't ignore.

205
00:12:00,041 --> 00:12:02,875
We really only have one choice.

206
00:12:02,958 --> 00:12:05,000
I don't want to hear it.

207
00:12:05,083 --> 00:12:06,708
We've got to do something.

208
00:12:09,625 --> 00:12:11,125
We have to hide.

209
00:12:11,208 --> 00:12:12,791
- Ah?
- Huh?

210
00:12:14,875 --> 00:12:15,875
Hide?

211
00:12:15,916 --> 00:12:17,708
Yes. Hide!

212
00:12:17,791 --> 00:12:20,583
You mean, pretend we're not here?

213
00:12:21,250 --> 00:12:22,250
Exactly.

214
00:12:31,666 --> 00:12:34,833
Operation Lie Low. Jolly good.

215
00:12:34,916 --> 00:12:38,250
Ooh! I like lilos.
Especially the stripy ones.

216
00:12:38,333 --> 00:12:39,500
She's right, you know.

217
00:12:39,583 --> 00:12:41,958
- It's really not our problem.
- Oh, you!

218
00:12:42,041 --> 00:12:43,708
Are you all right, hen?

219
00:12:44,416 --> 00:12:47,083
It's not like you to shy away from danger.

220
00:12:47,583 --> 00:12:51,000
I know, but I have Molly
to think about now.

221
00:12:51,083 --> 00:12:52,083
And I...

222
00:12:52,166 --> 00:12:54,375
<i>We</i> can't risk our freedom

223
00:12:54,458 --> 00:12:57,583
by venturing into a world
that finds chickens so...

224
00:12:59,333 --> 00:13:00,458
delicious.

225
00:13:08,875 --> 00:13:09,958
Lift!

226
00:13:19,583 --> 00:13:21,000
Right.

227
00:13:21,083 --> 00:13:25,333
All we have to do now is keep quiet
and not draw attention to ourselves.

228
00:13:25,416 --> 00:13:29,250
Cock-a-doodle-doo!

229
00:13:33,833 --> 00:13:35,083
Rocky!

230
00:13:35,166 --> 00:13:41,333
Um, given our new situation,
maybe you shouldn't crow anymore.

231
00:13:44,083 --> 00:13:45,791
Don't crow?

232
00:13:45,875 --> 00:13:48,416
What?
But that's, like, my thing.

233
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:50,958
Maybe you could do a different thing.

234
00:13:51,041 --> 00:13:52,041
A quieter one?

235
00:13:52,125 --> 00:13:53,875
Wow! Look at this!

236
00:13:53,958 --> 00:13:55,708
Molly! Get away from that.

237
00:13:55,791 --> 00:13:59,333
- Ginge, can we talk about the whole...
- She's right, you know.

238
00:14:00,708 --> 00:14:04,666
Careless squawks cost lives.

239
00:14:04,750 --> 00:14:06,458
We have to lie low.

240
00:14:06,958 --> 00:14:09,750
I'm running a camouflage lesson at noon.

241
00:14:10,333 --> 00:14:12,708
<i>If</i> you can find me.

242
00:14:14,583 --> 00:14:15,791
Ooh.

243
00:14:17,958 --> 00:14:19,583
What's it for, Mum?

244
00:14:23,666 --> 00:14:26,166
Oh! What is that?

245
00:14:28,833 --> 00:14:31,500
It's got a chicken sitting
in a bucket on it.

246
00:14:31,583 --> 00:14:33,333
It's doing this.

247
00:14:33,416 --> 00:14:35,375
Oh, that's so funny.

248
00:14:35,458 --> 00:14:37,791
Uh, let's go home.

249
00:14:42,458 --> 00:14:45,000
Where are they going?
Can we go with them?

250
00:14:45,083 --> 00:14:47,333
- It looks like a lot of fun.
- I'm sorry, Molly.

251
00:14:47,416 --> 00:14:49,791
- You're not ready to go off the island.
- But I...

252
00:14:49,875 --> 00:14:52,458
Uh, Rocky? Little help?

253
00:14:52,541 --> 00:14:54,916
Maybe I could crow on weekends. Y'know?

254
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,375
Why am I not ready?

255
00:14:56,458 --> 00:14:57,750
I'm a big, brave girl.

256
00:14:57,833 --> 00:15:00,000
- You always say so.
- I know.

257
00:15:00,083 --> 00:15:01,708
But you're still a child.

258
00:15:01,791 --> 00:15:03,166
Says who?

259
00:15:03,250 --> 00:15:05,375
Says me and your dad.

260
00:15:05,458 --> 00:15:06,541
Right, Rocky?

261
00:15:06,625 --> 00:15:09,958
Yeah, that's right. That's right. Yes.
Listen to your mom, kiddo.

262
00:15:10,041 --> 00:15:13,958
Oh! Oh. How about just half a crow?
Like a "cock-a" or "doodle-doo"?

263
00:15:14,041 --> 00:15:15,500
Something that's a little shorter.

264
00:15:15,583 --> 00:15:20,833
Well, I'm going over to see those trucks
because I am a Lone Free Ranger.

265
00:15:20,916 --> 00:15:22,166
Like Dad was.

266
00:15:23,250 --> 00:15:24,583
I've seen his poster.

267
00:15:24,666 --> 00:15:25,708
Ah.

268
00:15:25,791 --> 00:15:28,416
He used to live over there,
and you did too.

269
00:15:31,333 --> 00:15:34,291
Did I say that? I don't... I don't remember.

270
00:15:34,375 --> 00:15:35,375
That's it.

271
00:15:35,458 --> 00:15:37,875
Molly, you are not leaving this island.

272
00:15:37,958 --> 00:15:40,833
You can't make me stay here.
You're not the boss of me.

273
00:15:40,916 --> 00:15:43,083
Actually, I am.

274
00:15:43,833 --> 00:15:48,458
Look, Molly, you've got
everything you want right here.

275
00:15:48,541 --> 00:15:50,583
Except for one thing.

276
00:15:50,666 --> 00:15:51,958
And what's that?

277
00:15:53,833 --> 00:15:55,083
Freedom.

278
00:16:02,166 --> 00:16:06,458
You know, she <i>is</i> a lot like you.

279
00:16:06,541 --> 00:16:09,708
Mm.

280
00:16:33,875 --> 00:16:36,625
Your daughter
is going to be delicious!

281
00:16:36,708 --> 00:16:39,500
Not the face! Not the face!

282
00:16:43,291 --> 00:16:45,625
- Huh?
- Molly?

283
00:16:47,750 --> 00:16:50,291
Molly?

284
00:16:50,375 --> 00:16:51,976
- Come out, Molly!
- Molly!

285
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,250
- Molly?
- Molly?

286
00:16:53,333 --> 00:16:54,684
- Molly!
- Molly!

287
00:16:54,708 --> 00:16:56,333
- Molly?
- Molly!

288
00:16:56,416 --> 00:16:58,059
Come out, Molly.

289
00:17:06,375 --> 00:17:07,208
No!

290
00:17:07,291 --> 00:17:10,500
She's left the island.

291
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,541
This isn't so bad.

292
00:17:18,166 --> 00:17:19,686
Don't know what Mum was worried about.

293
00:17:19,750 --> 00:17:23,208
I'm big and I'm brave.

294
00:17:23,291 --> 00:17:24,708
Yeah, course I am.

295
00:17:25,208 --> 00:17:27,666
I'm big...

296
00:17:28,750 --> 00:17:29,833
And...

297
00:17:29,916 --> 00:17:31,458
...not very brave.

298
00:17:46,333 --> 00:17:47,333
Huh?

299
00:17:50,458 --> 00:17:51,458
Hmm?

300
00:17:57,791 --> 00:18:00,750
What were you doin'?
Have you got a death wish?

301
00:18:00,833 --> 00:18:02,083
No.

302
00:18:04,541 --> 00:18:06,833
Wait, what's a death wish?

303
00:18:09,208 --> 00:18:12,375
Isn't it a bit late
for you to be out, baby girl?

304
00:18:12,458 --> 00:18:14,375
I'm not a baby girl.

305
00:18:14,875 --> 00:18:16,750
I'm a... I'm a big, brave girl.

306
00:18:17,250 --> 00:18:20,333
And isn't it a bit late
for you to be out too?

307
00:18:22,750 --> 00:18:25,208
Okay, I like it.

308
00:18:25,708 --> 00:18:27,166
Give as good as you get, eh?

309
00:18:27,666 --> 00:18:29,791
Well, I'm Frizzle.

310
00:18:30,833 --> 00:18:32,083
And you are?

311
00:18:33,416 --> 00:18:34,416
Molly.

312
00:18:34,791 --> 00:18:36,750
Although,
it's kind of a goofy name.

313
00:18:36,833 --> 00:18:38,416
So I'm thinking of changing it to...

314
00:18:38,500 --> 00:18:39,500
Zip it, kidda.

315
00:18:39,541 --> 00:18:42,625
It's stoppin'. Now's our chance.

316
00:18:44,208 --> 00:18:46,791
- Are you comin' or not?
- Coming where?

317
00:18:46,875 --> 00:18:48,916
To the happy chicken truck.

318
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,791
You've seen them too?

319
00:18:50,875 --> 00:18:52,333
Right.

320
00:18:53,583 --> 00:18:55,625
Wherever that truck's goin',

321
00:18:55,708 --> 00:18:58,958
it's gonna be cooler
than a penguin's toenails.

322
00:18:59,541 --> 00:19:02,083
Uh, what's a toenail?

323
00:19:02,708 --> 00:19:04,041
What's a penguin?

324
00:19:04,125 --> 00:19:08,041
Oh! You have got so much to learn.
Come on.

325
00:19:09,958 --> 00:19:11,875
Wait for me!

326
00:19:12,666 --> 00:19:15,916
I mean, so she found my poster,
and I told her a story.

327
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,291
I don't think that's such a big deal.

328
00:19:18,375 --> 00:19:21,541
Oh no. It was perfectly sensible
to encourage our daughter

329
00:19:21,625 --> 00:19:23,375
to be a Lone Free Ranger.

330
00:19:23,458 --> 00:19:26,041
You know, if you had it your way,
she'd still be in her shell.

331
00:19:26,125 --> 00:19:29,041
Well, better in her shell
than out on the open road.

332
00:19:29,125 --> 00:19:32,666
So, do you live on an island too?

333
00:19:32,750 --> 00:19:35,833
Nah. I was stuck on a boring old farm.

334
00:19:35,916 --> 00:19:39,208
Then the trucks came,
and they said I was too small to go.

335
00:19:39,291 --> 00:19:40,750
But that's not gonna stop me.

336
00:19:40,833 --> 00:19:42,625
You get to sit in a bucket.

337
00:19:43,125 --> 00:19:45,333
What chicken doesn't want
their own bucket?

338
00:19:45,416 --> 00:19:47,250
I want a bucket.

339
00:19:47,333 --> 00:19:48,708
The thing about us, Mol,

340
00:19:48,791 --> 00:19:52,458
is that we wanna go
where we wanna go whenever we want.

341
00:19:52,541 --> 00:19:55,875
Yeah. With nobody telling us
what we can and can't do.

342
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,625
Me and you, kidda. All the way.

343
00:20:04,291 --> 00:20:05,916
Holy moly.

344
00:20:08,333 --> 00:20:12,083
Hear that? It's like a party in there.

345
00:20:16,916 --> 00:20:18,875
Oh!

346
00:20:19,625 --> 00:20:21,666
What is that?

347
00:20:22,166 --> 00:20:24,375
You've never seen a human before?

348
00:20:26,083 --> 00:20:28,041
We had them back at the farm.

349
00:20:28,125 --> 00:20:30,083
They're kinda stupid.

350
00:20:30,166 --> 00:20:33,708
They fed us and tidied up after us.
They're basically like waitin' staff.

351
00:20:33,791 --> 00:20:34,958
Oi!

352
00:20:35,041 --> 00:20:36,250
- Oi, you!
- Huh?

353
00:20:36,750 --> 00:20:38,625
How did you two get out here?

354
00:20:38,708 --> 00:20:40,750
- What do you say, Molly?
- Uh...

355
00:20:40,833 --> 00:20:43,541
Do you want to come
on the adventure of a lifetime or not?

356
00:20:44,333 --> 00:20:46,000
Uh...

357
00:20:47,125 --> 00:20:48,375
- Oh no!
- Oh no!

358
00:20:48,458 --> 00:20:49,875
Molly!

359
00:20:55,041 --> 00:20:55,875
{\an8}Ginger!

360
00:21:00,833 --> 00:21:01,833
Huh?

361
00:21:09,416 --> 00:21:11,625
Molly!

362
00:21:14,625 --> 00:21:15,916
I know what you're thinking.

363
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,583
Where are the buckets?

364
00:21:18,083 --> 00:21:20,250
I bet they give 'em to us
when we get there.

365
00:21:20,333 --> 00:21:22,458
- Are we nearly there yet?
- Molly!

366
00:21:25,375 --> 00:21:27,208
Huh?

367
00:21:28,541 --> 00:21:29,916
Hello.

368
00:21:41,875 --> 00:21:43,916
There go the goujons!

369
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,666
- Hang on, Fowler!
- What do you think I'm doing?

370
00:21:53,458 --> 00:21:55,125
Molly!

371
00:22:06,708 --> 00:22:09,083
Well, hey. That doesn't look so bad.

372
00:22:13,750 --> 00:22:17,333
Oh, that looks so bad.

373
00:22:34,625 --> 00:22:36,125
Right. Stop here.

374
00:22:37,875 --> 00:22:39,583
Let's have a look.

375
00:22:40,666 --> 00:22:42,666
- Okay, all clear.
- On your way.

376
00:23:14,750 --> 00:23:16,166
We mustn't panic.

377
00:23:16,250 --> 00:23:18,083
- No. No panicking.
- I don't like it.

378
00:23:18,166 --> 00:23:21,625
It's a perfect time to panic.
The enemy has the upper hand.

379
00:23:21,708 --> 00:23:23,208
We must keep our heads!

380
00:23:23,291 --> 00:23:25,971
- Where should we keep them?
- I'm trying to think here.

381
00:23:26,041 --> 00:23:28,583
No panicking. No. I said no panicking!

382
00:23:28,666 --> 00:23:31,583
- Ginger, what do <i>you</i> say?
- What did I say?

383
00:23:34,166 --> 00:23:38,833
I say, last time,
we broke out of a chicken farm.

384
00:23:39,333 --> 00:23:42,708
Well, this time, we're breaking <i>in.</i>

385
00:23:52,083 --> 00:23:54,583
Ooh!

386
00:23:56,333 --> 00:23:58,892
- It smells funny.
- This is not what I expected.

387
00:23:58,916 --> 00:24:03,208
This is, uh... cool, isn't it?

388
00:24:05,083 --> 00:24:07,666
That's it, my lovelies.

389
00:24:07,750 --> 00:24:10,250
Come on down.

390
00:24:14,125 --> 00:24:15,583
Ah.

391
00:24:20,333 --> 00:24:22,208
I don't fancy that.

392
00:24:22,291 --> 00:24:23,666
- Come on.
- Huh?

393
00:24:24,875 --> 00:24:25,958
Over here.

394
00:24:29,250 --> 00:24:30,958
- Ooh!
- Huh?

395
00:24:47,291 --> 00:24:48,166
Huh?

396
00:24:49,791 --> 00:24:51,750
Wow.

397
00:24:57,916 --> 00:25:02,291
Did I promise you
the adventure of a lifetime or what?

398
00:25:02,375 --> 00:25:05,291
Come on. Let's play.

399
00:25:06,375 --> 00:25:08,041
Whoo-hoo!

400
00:25:08,125 --> 00:25:09,791
Yeah!

401
00:25:09,875 --> 00:25:11,791
Let's go in the pool.

402
00:25:15,291 --> 00:25:17,708
Listen, everyone. We can do this.

403
00:25:17,791 --> 00:25:20,458
- We just need a really clever plan.
- Ooh. Ooh.

404
00:25:20,541 --> 00:25:22,291
Okay. I've got this. I've got this.

405
00:25:23,291 --> 00:25:28,333
I'm gonna go in there,
and I'm gonna bust Molly out.

406
00:25:28,833 --> 00:25:31,791
And just how the bloomin' heck
are you going to do that?

407
00:25:32,500 --> 00:25:37,500
Well, by, uh... uh, y'know, going in there

408
00:25:37,583 --> 00:25:40,000
and then... busting her out.

409
00:25:41,041 --> 00:25:42,958
That's not a plan.

410
00:25:43,041 --> 00:25:45,083
That's just saying
what you wish would happen.

411
00:25:45,166 --> 00:25:46,916
Aye, and 12 herrings and a bagpipe

412
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:50,166
are just a pile of mince
if you havnae kent the rules.

413
00:25:50,250 --> 00:25:52,791
You know,
that sounded a little negative to me.

414
00:25:52,875 --> 00:25:55,250
Mac's right. We need more details.

415
00:25:55,750 --> 00:25:58,625
We only get one shot at this,
so we need to make sure

416
00:25:58,708 --> 00:26:02,291
that every move we make
is carefully thought through.

417
00:26:02,375 --> 00:26:04,000
We can't just rush in and...

418
00:26:04,083 --> 00:26:07,041
Uh, Rocky?

419
00:26:09,416 --> 00:26:10,583
What are you doing?

420
00:26:11,083 --> 00:26:13,916
Sometimes you just gotta take a leap,
Ginger.

421
00:26:14,791 --> 00:26:16,375
- You ready, Fowler?
- Ready.

422
00:26:16,875 --> 00:26:18,000
- Fire.
- Rocky.

423
00:26:25,208 --> 00:26:26,625
Cock-a-doodle...

424
00:26:26,708 --> 00:26:28,666
Huh?

425
00:26:37,250 --> 00:26:39,250
Huh?

426
00:26:59,083 --> 00:27:01,416
Whoa!

427
00:27:10,416 --> 00:27:11,541
Huh?

428
00:27:30,833 --> 00:27:32,583
Huh?

429
00:27:39,666 --> 00:27:41,833
Ooh, that went well.

430
00:27:42,958 --> 00:27:45,333
Well, one good thing.

431
00:27:45,833 --> 00:27:47,791
At least now we've got the details.

432
00:27:47,875 --> 00:27:51,416
Right.
We're gonna need some backup.

433
00:27:53,333 --> 00:27:57,416
No way. That place is impenetrable.

434
00:27:57,500 --> 00:27:59,125
Yeah, and you can't get in neither.

435
00:28:01,333 --> 00:28:02,750
It's an impossible mission.

436
00:28:02,833 --> 00:28:05,916
Uh, shouldn't it be the other way around?

437
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,750
Don't be a 'nana, Fetch.

438
00:28:09,250 --> 00:28:11,083
I know it looks
like a million-to-one shot,

439
00:28:11,166 --> 00:28:14,458
but we know the layout,
and Mac thinks there's a way in.

440
00:28:14,541 --> 00:28:16,916
This is Fun Land Farm.

441
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:18,166
Oh!

442
00:28:18,250 --> 00:28:20,833
It's much smaller than I expected.

443
00:28:20,916 --> 00:28:23,000
Uh, thanks, Babs.

444
00:28:23,500 --> 00:28:27,250
There's a wee side door in a blind spot.

445
00:28:27,833 --> 00:28:29,833
With a cheeky wee trick to open it.

446
00:28:32,375 --> 00:28:35,375
So, only the small matter
of this electric fence.

447
00:28:35,458 --> 00:28:36,500
All these guards.

448
00:28:36,583 --> 00:28:38,750
The camera-driven gun-toting moles.

449
00:28:38,833 --> 00:28:41,916
And the laser-guided exploding ducks.

450
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:45,583
Please. You've got to help us.
Rocky's in there.

451
00:28:45,666 --> 00:28:47,125
Ah, shame. I quite liked him.

452
00:28:47,208 --> 00:28:48,833
And so is Molly.

453
00:28:49,541 --> 00:28:51,541
Molly? Our little niece?

454
00:28:51,625 --> 00:28:52,833
Steady, mate.

455
00:28:52,916 --> 00:28:55,916
Stay strong.

456
00:29:00,416 --> 00:29:03,500
- So you're in?
- Just tell us what you need.

457
00:29:03,583 --> 00:29:07,458
Anything for our little Molly!

458
00:29:09,083 --> 00:29:10,666
We can do this, everyone.

459
00:29:10,750 --> 00:29:15,083
Bunty, with your strength, my love,
we can move mountains.

460
00:29:15,166 --> 00:29:16,666
Mac, you're the brains.

461
00:29:17,666 --> 00:29:21,208
Babs, you're our... wool specialist.

462
00:29:21,291 --> 00:29:22,291
Ah.

463
00:29:22,375 --> 00:29:23,291
Nick and Fetch,

464
00:29:23,375 --> 00:29:26,500
you're the sneakiest little toerags
this side of the Dales.

465
00:29:26,583 --> 00:29:27,791
Oh.

466
00:29:27,875 --> 00:29:29,916
- You're too kind.
- Flatterer.

467
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:33,458
And, Fowler, with your wisdom
and vigilance...

468
00:29:33,541 --> 00:29:35,541
Fowler?

469
00:29:38,458 --> 00:29:43,125
Ooh. And then the second wave
of bombers approach the target,

470
00:29:43,208 --> 00:29:45,083
and that's where I come in.

471
00:29:46,125 --> 00:29:50,375
Actually, Fowler,
we need to find something special for you.

472
00:29:50,458 --> 00:29:52,791
Ah, right.

473
00:29:53,291 --> 00:29:55,500
How about... getaway man?

474
00:29:55,583 --> 00:29:58,000
Getaway man, eh?

475
00:29:58,083 --> 00:30:01,250
Hmm. Sounds important.

476
00:30:01,750 --> 00:30:02,916
I like it.

477
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:06,333
Right. Let's gather what we need
and hurry.

478
00:30:06,833 --> 00:30:09,458
Who knows what horrors
Molly is dealing with in there.

479
00:30:14,541 --> 00:30:16,208
Whoo-hoo!

480
00:30:16,291 --> 00:30:18,916
- Wow!
- This place is fun!

481
00:30:20,416 --> 00:30:23,333
It's the most amazin' place ever.

482
00:30:23,416 --> 00:30:25,333
And my mum said that's where <i>we</i> live.

483
00:30:25,416 --> 00:30:26,541
Yeah, right.

484
00:30:26,625 --> 00:30:29,375
Are the streets paved
with marshmallows where you live?

485
00:30:29,958 --> 00:30:31,791
Can ya bounce on them?

486
00:30:31,875 --> 00:30:35,125
No! They're paved with dirt.

487
00:30:35,208 --> 00:30:38,375
Can you lie around doin' nothin' all day?

488
00:30:38,458 --> 00:30:40,250
Actually, my dad can.

489
00:30:40,333 --> 00:30:43,583
Well, everyone can do that here.

490
00:30:43,666 --> 00:30:45,208
Wow.

491
00:30:45,958 --> 00:30:49,208
I've heard of this,
but I never knew it actually existed.

492
00:30:49,291 --> 00:30:51,166
Cool. What is it?

493
00:30:51,250 --> 00:30:53,791
All-you-can-eat buffet.

494
00:30:56,083 --> 00:30:58,416
Hey!

495
00:30:59,750 --> 00:31:02,291
Cooler than a penguin's toenails.

496
00:31:02,375 --> 00:31:04,125
Right?

497
00:31:04,208 --> 00:31:05,416
Mm!

498
00:31:06,583 --> 00:31:07,916
Whee!

499
00:31:10,375 --> 00:31:13,291
It's just, back home, I had jobs to do.

500
00:31:14,541 --> 00:31:17,958
I helped Mac with the harvester,
helped Bunty pick carrots,

501
00:31:18,541 --> 00:31:20,416
made yarn with Babs.

502
00:31:20,500 --> 00:31:22,500
But here, it's just play.

503
00:31:25,333 --> 00:31:27,166
And then more play.

504
00:31:29,125 --> 00:31:30,833
I wonder if they're missing me.

505
00:31:31,333 --> 00:31:34,291
It's great, innit?
We're free to do whatever we want.

506
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:38,458
Whoo-hoo!

507
00:31:38,541 --> 00:31:41,041
Whoo!

508
00:31:41,125 --> 00:31:42,208
Come on!

509
00:31:42,958 --> 00:31:45,041
Whee!

510
00:31:45,125 --> 00:31:46,541
Yay!

511
00:31:51,208 --> 00:31:53,000
Sorry.

512
00:31:53,083 --> 00:31:54,083
Hmm?

513
00:31:54,791 --> 00:31:56,916
Whee!

514
00:31:59,916 --> 00:32:01,541
- Ooh!
- Ah!

515
00:32:04,875 --> 00:32:06,791
Huh?

516
00:32:06,875 --> 00:32:08,059
Whee!

517
00:32:08,083 --> 00:32:09,166
Hmm?

518
00:32:13,291 --> 00:32:14,583
Ah.

519
00:32:23,875 --> 00:32:26,166
Oh! Uh-oh!

520
00:32:26,250 --> 00:32:28,125
Uh... Um...

521
00:32:28,208 --> 00:32:30,000
Uh... Frizzle!

522
00:32:31,333 --> 00:32:34,333
There's actually something strange
about this place.

523
00:32:34,416 --> 00:32:35,416
I'll say.

524
00:32:39,125 --> 00:32:41,625
Ever seen anything like this before?

525
00:32:52,958 --> 00:32:55,708
Oh no, what's this?

526
00:32:55,791 --> 00:32:59,291
You aren't supposed to be back there,
number...

527
00:32:59,375 --> 00:33:02,833
Hmm.
You don't have a number?

528
00:33:05,916 --> 00:33:08,583
We don't want chickens
making any trouble here.

529
00:33:10,166 --> 00:33:13,541
Especially not today.

530
00:33:44,666 --> 00:33:48,000
Okay, everyone. It's go time.

531
00:33:48,791 --> 00:33:52,041
It's all right. I went before we left.

532
00:34:14,791 --> 00:34:15,791
Hmm.

533
00:34:20,041 --> 00:34:21,125
Mm!

534
00:34:30,708 --> 00:34:32,250
What the... Huh?

535
00:34:36,083 --> 00:34:37,083
Huh?

536
00:34:48,541 --> 00:34:50,541
Huh?

537
00:34:52,750 --> 00:34:53,875
Oh!

538
00:35:13,208 --> 00:35:14,041
Huh?

539
00:35:16,166 --> 00:35:17,958
No, you mug.

540
00:35:18,041 --> 00:35:19,458
It's upside down.

541
00:35:19,541 --> 00:35:21,250
Oh right.

542
00:35:26,083 --> 00:35:27,375
Mm.

543
00:35:40,083 --> 00:35:41,875
Go! Go! Go!

544
00:35:52,083 --> 00:35:53,333
Yup?

545
00:36:08,875 --> 00:36:10,625
All clear.

546
00:36:34,208 --> 00:36:36,333
Ah.

547
00:36:43,625 --> 00:36:44,625
Let's go.

548
00:37:03,500 --> 00:37:04,750
Oh!

549
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:13,416
Perfect landin'.
Right on the button.

550
00:37:13,500 --> 00:37:14,916
Right on the button?

551
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:16,583
Mm. Okay.

552
00:37:21,125 --> 00:37:22,583
Let me out!

553
00:37:26,125 --> 00:37:27,125
The camera!

554
00:37:27,208 --> 00:37:29,041
I've got it.

555
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:33,416
Huh?

556
00:37:33,916 --> 00:37:35,166
Hmm?

557
00:38:17,291 --> 00:38:18,291
Mm.

558
00:38:19,041 --> 00:38:20,791
Huh?

559
00:38:34,291 --> 00:38:35,458
Huh?

560
00:38:35,541 --> 00:38:38,208
- Hmm?
- Hmm.

561
00:38:41,208 --> 00:38:43,458
"Getaway man," she said.

562
00:38:45,416 --> 00:38:49,375
More like taxi driver
for a couple of rats.

563
00:38:50,291 --> 00:38:52,625
There. Textbook landing.

564
00:38:52,708 --> 00:38:53,750
Ah, oh.

565
00:38:54,416 --> 00:38:56,125
At ease, soldier.

566
00:38:57,000 --> 00:39:00,125
I reckon they think
I'm too old for this caper.

567
00:39:00,208 --> 00:39:03,583
Some rambling old rooster
who's easily distracted.

568
00:39:03,666 --> 00:39:09,791
Hm. Oh, actually,
there's quite an amusing story about that.

569
00:39:09,875 --> 00:39:12,916
One time, I <i>was</i> out rambling...

570
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:15,041
Well, on maneuvers, and...

571
00:39:22,916 --> 00:39:24,041
All right.

572
00:39:24,541 --> 00:39:25,791
I'm inside.

573
00:39:25,875 --> 00:39:27,875
Huh?

574
00:39:31,333 --> 00:39:33,000
Get off of me.

575
00:39:33,083 --> 00:39:34,666
Oh. Uh, ooh.

576
00:39:34,750 --> 00:39:40,625
Nick, uh, I don't wanna worry you,
but I think your bum just spoke.

577
00:39:40,708 --> 00:39:42,458
Huh?

578
00:39:43,291 --> 00:39:45,208
Guys? What are you doin' here?

579
00:39:45,291 --> 00:39:47,583
Rocky!

580
00:39:47,666 --> 00:39:50,125
We're with Ginger.
Uh, we've come to rescue ya.

581
00:39:50,208 --> 00:39:52,083
Rescue <i>me?</i>

582
00:39:52,166 --> 00:39:54,375
No, no. I'm <i>doing</i> the rescuing.

583
00:39:54,458 --> 00:39:56,583
I'm not <i>being</i> rescued.

584
00:39:56,666 --> 00:39:58,708
I am rescuing Molly.

585
00:40:01,375 --> 00:40:02,583
How's that going, then?

586
00:40:03,250 --> 00:40:05,166
Well...

587
00:40:05,250 --> 00:40:10,083
Look, don't take this the wrong way,
but you guys are just gonna hold me back.

588
00:40:10,583 --> 00:40:12,125
I tend to work alone.

589
00:40:12,208 --> 00:40:13,208
Oh, yeah?

590
00:40:13,750 --> 00:40:16,333
Yeah, the Lone Free Ranger.

591
00:40:16,416 --> 00:40:18,375
Right? And I am close.

592
00:40:18,458 --> 00:40:20,000
I can <i>feel</i> it.

593
00:40:20,083 --> 00:40:21,958
I'm gettin' warm, boys.

594
00:40:23,166 --> 00:40:24,875
<i>Really</i> warm, actually.

595
00:40:24,958 --> 00:40:27,958
Can anyone smell roast chicken?

596
00:40:35,750 --> 00:40:38,000
I said you'd hold me back!

597
00:40:43,583 --> 00:40:44,916
Whoa!

598
00:40:49,708 --> 00:40:51,083
Huh?

599
00:40:56,541 --> 00:40:57,666
Oh dear.

600
00:40:57,750 --> 00:41:00,083
We actually planned that.

601
00:41:00,166 --> 00:41:02,208
Did we?

602
00:41:04,875 --> 00:41:07,250
Okay. I've gotta go find Molly.

603
00:41:07,333 --> 00:41:09,416
Molly?

604
00:41:09,500 --> 00:41:12,375
Hold it back, son. Hold it back.

605
00:41:15,208 --> 00:41:16,541
Ah.

606
00:41:17,500 --> 00:41:18,791
Look at them.

607
00:41:19,291 --> 00:41:22,708
- It's like they're all a bit... brainless.
- Ah.

608
00:41:22,791 --> 00:41:26,666
Erm. I don't think I like it here.

609
00:41:26,750 --> 00:41:31,083
Yeah. It's not as much fun
as it looked on the poster, is it?

610
00:41:31,166 --> 00:41:33,041
Hey, Frizzle.

611
00:41:33,125 --> 00:41:36,250
Maybe we should try and find out
what's going on in this place.

612
00:41:36,833 --> 00:41:40,875
Now, <i>that</i> sounds like
a real adventure.

613
00:41:40,958 --> 00:41:41,833
Come on.

614
00:41:41,916 --> 00:41:43,833
Let's investigate.

615
00:42:07,875 --> 00:42:09,416
Ah!

616
00:42:10,541 --> 00:42:13,333
Come on, now,
you naughty little thing.

617
00:42:13,416 --> 00:42:17,291
I'm just your big chicken friend
who only wants you to be happy.

618
00:42:21,625 --> 00:42:23,500
Frizzle!

619
00:42:31,166 --> 00:42:32,666
What was that?

620
00:42:37,416 --> 00:42:39,083
Hello.

621
00:42:41,125 --> 00:42:42,208
Who are you?

622
00:42:42,791 --> 00:42:43,916
What?

623
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:46,166
It's me. Molly.

624
00:42:47,500 --> 00:42:50,083
Happy to meet you.

625
00:42:50,166 --> 00:42:53,625
Frizzle, what's this?

626
00:42:55,208 --> 00:42:56,208
Huh?

627
00:42:58,625 --> 00:43:00,041
Come on, Frizzle.

628
00:43:00,125 --> 00:43:01,875
We've got to go.

629
00:43:05,458 --> 00:43:09,041
But I've never been so happy.

630
00:43:09,125 --> 00:43:11,333
Whee!

631
00:43:25,333 --> 00:43:26,333
No.

632
00:43:27,416 --> 00:43:28,666
I'm big...

633
00:43:32,208 --> 00:43:33,583
...and I'm brave.

634
00:43:34,083 --> 00:43:36,041
Frizzle.

635
00:43:36,125 --> 00:43:39,000
Listen. I'm going to find out
what's going on here.

636
00:43:39,083 --> 00:43:40,666
Then I will be back.

637
00:43:40,750 --> 00:43:42,291
I promise.

638
00:43:46,416 --> 00:43:47,416
Huh?

639
00:43:59,333 --> 00:44:00,458
Huh?

640
00:44:02,416 --> 00:44:04,333
Whoa.

641
00:44:17,583 --> 00:44:21,000
<i>Dr. Fry, your guest has arrived.</i>

642
00:44:21,583 --> 00:44:24,541
Sir Eat-a-Lot.

643
00:44:25,541 --> 00:44:26,541
Right.

644
00:44:26,625 --> 00:44:28,833
It's showtime.

645
00:44:37,291 --> 00:44:40,666
Ah, Sir Eat-a-Lot! Welcome.

646
00:44:40,750 --> 00:44:43,416
What an honor
to have a knight of the realm with us.

647
00:44:43,500 --> 00:44:46,250
Actually, Sir Eat-a-Lot
is just the name of the restaurant.

648
00:44:46,333 --> 00:44:48,416
My name is... Oh.

649
00:44:57,500 --> 00:44:58,500
Oh.

650
00:45:01,041 --> 00:45:03,166
Here at Fun Land Farms,

651
00:45:03,250 --> 00:45:08,208
we do everything we can
to make our chickens feel right at home.

652
00:45:10,375 --> 00:45:14,000
Well, I must say, I've never seen
a farm like this before, Dr. Fry.

653
00:45:14,500 --> 00:45:16,625
Is all this security really necessary?

654
00:45:16,708 --> 00:45:17,750
Oh yes.

655
00:45:17,833 --> 00:45:18,666
Molly.

656
00:45:18,750 --> 00:45:22,083
You see, behind these doors are secrets

657
00:45:22,166 --> 00:45:25,583
that will change
the world of poultry technology forever.

658
00:45:25,666 --> 00:45:26,708
Come on.

659
00:45:30,791 --> 00:45:32,375
No!

660
00:45:37,083 --> 00:45:39,166
Oi, what are you lot doing?

661
00:45:44,916 --> 00:45:47,458
Attack!

662
00:45:47,541 --> 00:45:49,625
This place is a maze.

663
00:45:50,125 --> 00:45:52,000
How am I ever gonna find Molly in here?

664
00:45:53,541 --> 00:45:55,208
- There she is.
- Huh?

665
00:45:56,958 --> 00:45:58,125
Molly?

666
00:46:00,208 --> 00:46:02,375
Molly! Molly!

667
00:46:06,416 --> 00:46:09,458
And, um,
how's the restaurant business?

668
00:46:09,541 --> 00:46:11,166
Actually, a little slow.

669
00:46:12,625 --> 00:46:15,458
Oh well,
I think we can help you with that.

670
00:46:15,541 --> 00:46:17,541
Molly!

671
00:46:18,666 --> 00:46:20,208
No! No!

672
00:46:22,041 --> 00:46:24,416
Molly! Molly! Molly!

673
00:46:32,375 --> 00:46:34,166
Ah. Ginger?

674
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:41,333
Right. I'm gone.

675
00:46:41,416 --> 00:46:43,125
Well, can't we just take the lift?

676
00:46:45,750 --> 00:46:48,541
All I can say, Dr. Fry,
is this had better be...

677
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:51,375
good.

678
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:57,541
My, uh, partner
will be joining us shortly.

679
00:46:58,083 --> 00:47:04,166
In the meantime, we've prepared
a little presentation.

680
00:47:04,250 --> 00:47:06,208
Please, be seated.

681
00:47:31,875 --> 00:47:34,416
<i>This is an ordinary chicken.</i>

682
00:47:34,500 --> 00:47:36,875
<i>Plain, dull, and easily frightened.</i>

683
00:47:38,416 --> 00:47:40,458
<i>Like any simpleminded creature,</i>

684
00:47:40,541 --> 00:47:42,958
<i>its natural instincts,
when faced with processing,</i>

685
00:47:43,041 --> 00:47:45,041
<i>is fear and panic.</i>

686
00:47:48,875 --> 00:47:51,541
<i>When this occurs,
the muscles tense,</i>

687
00:47:51,625 --> 00:47:55,125
<i>which cause the connective tissues
to form knots.</i>

688
00:47:56,375 --> 00:47:57,500
<i>The result?</i>

689
00:47:57,583 --> 00:48:01,583
<i>Meat that is tough, dry, and flavorless.</i>

690
00:48:03,083 --> 00:48:06,041
<i>Mummy, this meat is tough,
dry, and flavorless.</i>

691
00:48:06,125 --> 00:48:08,250
<i>- I hate you, Mummy.
- Oh!</i>

692
00:48:09,875 --> 00:48:10,708
Molly.

693
00:48:10,791 --> 00:48:13,208
<i>Fear not,
underappreciated mother.</i>

694
00:48:13,291 --> 00:48:16,208
<i>For what if science could change all that?</i>

695
00:48:16,291 --> 00:48:20,208
<i>For what if science could alter
a chicken's response to fear?</i>

696
00:48:22,833 --> 00:48:26,750
<i>What if it could make
a chicken happy to be processed?</i>

697
00:48:28,958 --> 00:48:31,708
<i>Then you'd say,
"Well done, science."</i>

698
00:48:34,375 --> 00:48:36,250
<i>Because a happy chicken</i>

699
00:48:36,833 --> 00:48:38,458
<i>is a tasty chicken.</i>

700
00:48:46,250 --> 00:48:49,375
<i>This is the most delicious chicken
in the whole wide world.</i>

701
00:48:49,458 --> 00:48:50,750
<i>I love you, Mummy.</i>

702
00:48:50,833 --> 00:48:52,416
<i>Thank you, science.</i>

703
00:48:55,500 --> 00:48:56,666
Molly.

704
00:48:58,291 --> 00:49:01,000
That's a clever little cartoon, Dr. Fry.

705
00:49:01,083 --> 00:49:02,708
But will you be able to do it?

706
00:49:02,791 --> 00:49:04,791
We already have.

707
00:49:04,875 --> 00:49:07,333
That voice.

708
00:49:26,958 --> 00:49:30,208
Allow me to introduce my wife.

709
00:49:31,791 --> 00:49:35,208
Melisha Tweedy.

710
00:49:37,791 --> 00:49:41,166
Welcome to the future.

711
00:49:45,125 --> 00:49:46,250
It's her.

712
00:49:48,875 --> 00:49:52,541
Darling, this is Sir Eat-a-Lot.

713
00:49:52,625 --> 00:49:54,333
The name is Reginald Smith.

714
00:49:54,416 --> 00:49:58,208
Sir Eat-a-Lot
is just the name of the restaurant chain.

715
00:50:00,291 --> 00:50:02,041
Hello, Reginald.

716
00:50:02,541 --> 00:50:06,666
I see you've met
my current husband, Dr. Fry.

717
00:50:07,500 --> 00:50:11,666
Was I attracted to his large inheritance
and vast acres of land?

718
00:50:12,166 --> 00:50:15,875
No, it was his mind.

719
00:50:15,958 --> 00:50:20,666
You probably can't tell
by looking at him, but he's a genius.

720
00:50:20,750 --> 00:50:22,375
You flatter me, darling.

721
00:50:22,458 --> 00:50:26,708
With degrees from Oxford
and Cambridge in clinical neurology,

722
00:50:26,791 --> 00:50:30,541
behavioral psychology,
genetic engineering...

723
00:50:30,625 --> 00:50:32,750
And drama!

724
00:50:37,083 --> 00:50:39,458
Now you've had the appetizer,

725
00:50:39,958 --> 00:50:42,333
time for the main course.

726
00:50:42,833 --> 00:50:43,666
Come.

727
00:50:48,875 --> 00:50:51,291
Molly, no. Get back.

728
00:50:51,791 --> 00:50:54,000
Let me go!

729
00:50:54,500 --> 00:50:56,708
Right. Try and find Molly.

730
00:50:56,791 --> 00:50:59,958
Oh, look.

731
00:51:00,041 --> 00:51:02,750
Rocky and the rats are on telly.

732
00:51:02,833 --> 00:51:05,208
Looks like a real cliffhanger.

733
00:51:05,791 --> 00:51:07,017
Where is she?

734
00:51:11,750 --> 00:51:12,750
Oh.

735
00:51:17,833 --> 00:51:19,208
Oh, look.

736
00:51:20,166 --> 00:51:22,666
They like the new egg cup ride.

737
00:51:27,708 --> 00:51:28,708
Frizzle.

738
00:51:29,791 --> 00:51:31,375
Mum?

739
00:51:31,458 --> 00:51:33,000
Oh, Mollypod.

740
00:51:33,083 --> 00:51:34,291
- Are you okay?
- Yes.

741
00:51:34,375 --> 00:51:36,000
Promise never to run away again.

742
00:51:36,083 --> 00:51:38,458
- Did they hurt you?
- I'm fine, but I think they eat...

743
00:51:38,541 --> 00:51:40,750
- Come on. Get on with it.
- Shh.

744
00:51:40,833 --> 00:51:42,625
Right you are, pumpkin.

745
00:51:44,833 --> 00:51:46,708
Behold.

746
00:51:46,791 --> 00:51:50,208
The remote control.

747
00:51:50,750 --> 00:51:55,000
And the other remote controls.

748
00:51:55,083 --> 00:51:56,625
Why three?

749
00:51:59,750 --> 00:52:01,833
Nobody knows.

750
00:52:02,500 --> 00:52:04,833
Let's go with...

751
00:52:06,500 --> 00:52:07,541
that one.

752
00:52:07,625 --> 00:52:09,416
Huh?

753
00:52:09,500 --> 00:52:11,375
- Why am I playing golf?
- Where am I?

754
00:52:11,458 --> 00:52:14,541
- What am I doing?
- Molly? Where are you, Molly?

755
00:52:14,625 --> 00:52:16,333
What's going on?

756
00:52:16,416 --> 00:52:19,083
No, no, no.
Wrong one, my angel.

757
00:52:19,166 --> 00:52:21,291
That's the off button.

758
00:52:21,375 --> 00:52:23,416
Ah!

759
00:52:25,458 --> 00:52:27,625
Allow me.

760
00:52:34,125 --> 00:52:37,208
It's me.

761
00:52:37,291 --> 00:52:39,541
Whoa!

762
00:52:39,625 --> 00:52:41,833
Ah!

763
00:52:43,625 --> 00:52:46,041
Ooh!

764
00:52:46,625 --> 00:52:49,208
She's won the prize.

765
00:52:49,291 --> 00:52:51,416
Oh wow.

766
00:52:51,500 --> 00:52:54,166
What a lucky ducky!

767
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:03,041
Ooh!

768
00:53:04,458 --> 00:53:06,333
No. Stop.

769
00:53:06,416 --> 00:53:08,708
Run, chicken! Run!

770
00:53:08,791 --> 00:53:10,333
Bye!

771
00:53:13,833 --> 00:53:16,833
Have a nice time!

772
00:53:22,916 --> 00:53:25,166
Look at me, and do not look away.

773
00:53:32,458 --> 00:53:33,750
Behold,

774
00:53:34,458 --> 00:53:37,541
the dawn of the nugget.

775
00:53:43,958 --> 00:53:45,833
Mm!

776
00:53:46,333 --> 00:53:48,625
I love you, Mummy.

777
00:53:49,291 --> 00:53:52,000
Um... Um, I... I... I mean, it's delicious.

778
00:53:52,583 --> 00:53:53,666
Picture it.

779
00:53:53,750 --> 00:53:56,583
On every street, in every town.

780
00:53:56,666 --> 00:53:58,250
People on the go.

781
00:53:58,333 --> 00:54:01,125
Modern people in a modern world.

782
00:54:01,208 --> 00:54:04,041
They want their food,
and they want it fast.

783
00:54:04,125 --> 00:54:08,291
And we will give it to them
by the bucketful.

784
00:54:11,833 --> 00:54:13,625
Fast food.

785
00:54:13,708 --> 00:54:15,708
I like it. This could be big.

786
00:54:16,208 --> 00:54:18,916
No. It will be <i>huge.</i>

787
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:22,666
And Melisha Tweedy will have her revenge.

788
00:54:26,958 --> 00:54:28,125
Revenge?

789
00:54:29,416 --> 00:54:32,125
Revenue. That's what I meant.

790
00:54:32,625 --> 00:54:36,833
I'll send a truck to collect
the first batch at dawn tomorrow.

791
00:54:37,333 --> 00:54:41,000
With my nuggets
and your chain of restaurants,

792
00:54:41,083 --> 00:54:45,041
this is going to be
a beautiful partnership.

793
00:54:45,125 --> 00:54:46,166
Ah.

794
00:54:48,916 --> 00:54:52,125
Uh, shall I see you to your car,
Your Sirness?

795
00:54:52,875 --> 00:54:53,875
Come on.

796
00:54:53,916 --> 00:54:55,125
Let's get out of here.

797
00:54:55,208 --> 00:54:57,541
No, wait. We can't go without Frizzle.

798
00:54:57,625 --> 00:55:00,125
Frizzle? Who's Frizzle?

799
00:55:00,208 --> 00:55:02,625
She's my friend. I can't just leave her.

800
00:55:02,708 --> 00:55:03,875
I promised I'd come back.

801
00:55:03,958 --> 00:55:06,166
Please, Molly. You don't understand.

802
00:55:06,250 --> 00:55:08,583
But you saw what happens. She'll die.

803
00:55:08,666 --> 00:55:11,708
And if we don't leave here now,
then we will die too.

804
00:55:11,791 --> 00:55:13,791
I don't care. I'm not leaving her here.

805
00:55:13,875 --> 00:55:15,000
You are just a child,

806
00:55:15,083 --> 00:55:17,166
and you have no idea
who you're dealing with.

807
00:55:18,958 --> 00:55:21,333
Uh...

808
00:55:22,666 --> 00:55:23,583
Bye-bye.

809
00:55:25,250 --> 00:55:26,375
You!

810
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:32,666
Huh?

811
00:55:34,458 --> 00:55:35,625
Come back here!

812
00:55:48,083 --> 00:55:51,916
Well now, the little escape artist.

813
00:55:52,500 --> 00:55:54,500
You won't ruin this.

814
00:55:54,583 --> 00:55:56,250
Not again.

815
00:55:56,333 --> 00:55:58,458
Come back immediately, Doctor.

816
00:55:58,541 --> 00:56:00,333
And bring a collar.

817
00:56:00,416 --> 00:56:03,333
We've an unexpected guest.

818
00:56:07,500 --> 00:56:09,541
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

819
00:56:11,500 --> 00:56:12,500
Stop.

820
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:15,125
You're pushin' us too hard, cuz.

821
00:56:15,208 --> 00:56:16,750
I ain't been this knackered

822
00:56:16,833 --> 00:56:20,125
since I took that hamster wheel
for a test-drive.

823
00:56:20,208 --> 00:56:22,416
- Here she is.
- Shh. Listen.

824
00:56:22,500 --> 00:56:25,375
The miserable,
malcontented chicken

825
00:56:25,458 --> 00:56:27,583
that escaped Tweedy's Farm

826
00:56:27,666 --> 00:56:30,333
and ruined my life.

827
00:56:31,500 --> 00:56:34,250
What is this bloomin' place?

828
00:56:34,333 --> 00:56:36,833
Molly, where are you?

829
00:56:47,166 --> 00:56:50,541
Ooh! He's laddered me knitting.

830
00:56:51,875 --> 00:56:52,875
Run!

831
00:56:56,250 --> 00:56:59,291
I gave you
all a hen could want.

832
00:56:59,375 --> 00:57:00,708
A warm hut,

833
00:57:00,791 --> 00:57:03,208
all the feed you could eat.

834
00:57:03,291 --> 00:57:06,916
But you still weren't happy.

835
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:09,916
Well, I'm gonna make ya happy now.

836
00:57:17,125 --> 00:57:18,875
Mum.

837
00:57:20,125 --> 00:57:21,375
I've gotta get in there.

838
00:57:21,458 --> 00:57:23,541
Ah, I've got an idea.

839
00:57:23,625 --> 00:57:27,125
- You're the Lone Free Ranger, right?
- Yeah.

840
00:57:27,208 --> 00:57:29,708
You used to get shot
out of a cannon, right?

841
00:57:29,791 --> 00:57:31,583
That is all... Why?

842
00:57:31,666 --> 00:57:33,666
Huh? Ah?

843
00:57:35,583 --> 00:57:38,208
It's not working. Turn up the power.

844
00:57:38,291 --> 00:57:40,083
The equipment's in good order, my love.

845
00:57:40,166 --> 00:57:43,833
I've just never seen a chicken
so strong-willed.

846
00:57:44,875 --> 00:57:46,595
You don't know
the half of it.

847
00:57:46,666 --> 00:57:49,833
Turn it up to full power.

848
00:57:49,916 --> 00:57:51,083
Full power?

849
00:57:51,166 --> 00:57:53,416
But we've never tested it
at that.

850
00:57:53,500 --> 00:57:56,458
Must I do everything myself?

851
00:57:56,541 --> 00:58:00,416
Husbands and chickens,
the bane of my life.

852
00:58:18,375 --> 00:58:19,541
Huh?

853
00:58:22,916 --> 00:58:24,809
Sure you can make this work?

854
00:58:24,833 --> 00:58:28,666
Oh yeah. There is nothing
Fetch don't know about electrics.

855
00:58:29,875 --> 00:58:32,625
He could chew through wiring
before he could walk.

856
00:58:33,125 --> 00:58:35,500
- Ready.
- Great work, boys.

857
00:58:35,583 --> 00:58:37,041
I'm ready to fly.

858
00:58:37,125 --> 00:58:38,666
Goodbye, cuz.

859
00:58:38,750 --> 00:58:40,791
Or should I say, "au revoir."

860
00:58:41,291 --> 00:58:43,833
It's more likely goodbye, to be honest.

861
00:58:48,625 --> 00:58:49,833
Hmm?

862
00:59:01,125 --> 00:59:02,458
Let's go.

863
00:59:06,250 --> 00:59:07,250
Come on, Mum.

864
00:59:07,333 --> 00:59:09,625
Mum? Who's Mum?

865
00:59:09,708 --> 00:59:13,083
You are. And we have to get out of here.

866
00:59:13,166 --> 00:59:16,208
Why? I love it here.

867
00:59:16,291 --> 00:59:18,958
I'm so happy.

868
00:59:19,041 --> 00:59:20,833
No.

869
00:59:20,916 --> 00:59:23,208
Huh?

870
00:59:25,208 --> 00:59:27,375
Dad?

871
00:59:28,166 --> 00:59:29,000
Molly.

872
00:59:34,958 --> 00:59:35,958
Hmm.

873
00:59:37,625 --> 00:59:38,916
Right.

874
00:59:41,625 --> 00:59:43,791
Whoo!

875
00:59:45,791 --> 00:59:46,916
Huh?

876
00:59:51,333 --> 00:59:54,041
He's got some moves.

877
00:59:58,916 --> 01:00:01,208
Mum, wait.

878
01:00:02,083 --> 01:00:02,916
Ha!

879
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:04,875
<i>♪ We can't fly, we are chickens! ♪</i>

880
01:00:04,958 --> 01:00:07,166
Ow!

881
01:00:10,791 --> 01:00:11,625
Get him.

882
01:00:11,708 --> 01:00:13,208
- Come here, you.
- Oi!

883
01:00:17,125 --> 01:00:18,791
Hey! Get him.

884
01:00:20,708 --> 01:00:22,416
Ow!

885
01:00:29,791 --> 01:00:33,291
Find those chickens!

886
01:00:35,333 --> 01:00:38,375
<i>♪ I'm H-A-P-P-Y! ♪</i>

887
01:00:38,458 --> 01:00:40,958
<i>♪ I'm H-A-P-P-Y! ♪</i>

888
01:00:41,041 --> 01:00:43,916
<i>♪ I know I am! I'm sure I am! ♪</i>

889
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:46,958
<i>♪ I'm H-A-P-P-Y! ♪</i>

890
01:00:47,041 --> 01:00:49,708
- Come on!
- Shush, Mum. We have to be quiet.

891
01:00:49,791 --> 01:00:52,458
- But I want to sing!
- Shh!

892
01:00:52,541 --> 01:00:55,291
- Just follow me.
- Oh, goody.

893
01:00:55,375 --> 01:00:57,125
Are we going on holiday?

894
01:00:57,208 --> 01:01:00,791
No, we have to find Frizzle
and Dad and get out of here.

895
01:01:00,875 --> 01:01:03,291
But why?

896
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:06,333
Because I say so.

897
01:01:06,416 --> 01:01:09,375
Well, you're not the boss of me.

898
01:01:10,916 --> 01:01:12,583
I can see my feet.

899
01:01:12,666 --> 01:01:13,750
Where'd they go?

900
01:01:13,833 --> 01:01:15,291
- Come on, Mum.
- Come on!

901
01:01:15,375 --> 01:01:17,375
- This way!
- Cooee!

902
01:01:17,458 --> 01:01:18,458
Huh?

903
01:01:20,833 --> 01:01:21,708
Wait up!

904
01:01:21,791 --> 01:01:24,708
Come on. Let's get a shimmy on.

905
01:01:30,291 --> 01:01:33,166
Ginger. Oh, thank heavens you escaped.

906
01:01:33,833 --> 01:01:36,458
I can't believe we're back up
against that horrible woman.

907
01:01:36,541 --> 01:01:39,750
What? Mrs. Tweedy's the best.

908
01:01:39,833 --> 01:01:41,375
- I love her.
- Bunty.

909
01:01:41,458 --> 01:01:43,559
- Mac. It's this collar.
- She's the loveliest.

910
01:01:43,583 --> 01:01:45,625
- It's making Mum act weird.
- The bestest.

911
01:01:45,708 --> 01:01:47,791
Molly!

912
01:01:49,791 --> 01:01:52,041
- Ooh!
- Cooee!

913
01:01:52,125 --> 01:01:53,666
Huh?

914
01:02:03,541 --> 01:02:06,000
- Ha. Got him.
- Uncle Nick?

915
01:02:06,083 --> 01:02:07,458
Uncle Fetch.

916
01:02:07,541 --> 01:02:09,291
How did you find us?

917
01:02:09,375 --> 01:02:12,166
- We just fell down the air vent.
- Love, Molly.

918
01:02:12,250 --> 01:02:13,375
Love showed us the way.

919
01:02:13,458 --> 01:02:15,166
Going up.

920
01:02:15,250 --> 01:02:17,875
- Cooee!
- Ginger!

921
01:02:17,958 --> 01:02:20,166
Mum!

922
01:02:23,500 --> 01:02:26,125
<i>♪ I'm H-A-P-P-Y ♪</i>

923
01:02:26,208 --> 01:02:27,500
<i>♪ I know I am ♪</i>

924
01:02:27,583 --> 01:02:29,458
<i>- ♪ I'm sure I am ♪</i>
- It won't budge.

925
01:02:29,541 --> 01:02:31,791
<i>- ♪ I'm H-A-P-P-Y ♪</i>
- Ooh. Babs, what's in your bag?

926
01:02:31,875 --> 01:02:33,875
Uh, not much, I'm afraid.

927
01:02:35,666 --> 01:02:36,666
Magic.

928
01:02:36,708 --> 01:02:37,875
The very dab.

929
01:02:39,416 --> 01:02:41,750
That tickles.

930
01:02:50,291 --> 01:02:51,416
Oh.

931
01:02:52,125 --> 01:02:55,750
It's like being
inside a giant biscuit tin.

932
01:02:56,333 --> 01:02:57,875
But without any biscuits.

933
01:02:57,958 --> 01:02:59,458
I've lost my specs.

934
01:02:59,541 --> 01:03:01,666
I cannae see a sausage.

935
01:03:02,333 --> 01:03:04,291
Mum?

936
01:03:04,791 --> 01:03:05,958
Mum!

937
01:03:13,250 --> 01:03:14,291
Molly?

938
01:03:14,375 --> 01:03:16,375
You're okay.

939
01:03:17,166 --> 01:03:18,458
Oh, Molly.

940
01:03:20,125 --> 01:03:22,875
What happened? Where are we?

941
01:03:23,750 --> 01:03:26,291
Don't know, but there's no way out.

942
01:03:27,708 --> 01:03:29,541
There's never no way out.

943
01:03:30,916 --> 01:03:31,916
Where's Rocky?

944
01:03:31,958 --> 01:03:33,708
I saw him back in that big room.

945
01:03:33,791 --> 01:03:35,541
He saved us.

946
01:03:36,166 --> 01:03:37,416
He did?

947
01:03:45,125 --> 01:03:46,791
Huh?

948
01:03:47,625 --> 01:03:48,750
Oh!

949
01:03:48,833 --> 01:03:51,708
Come on. We can do it this time.

950
01:03:51,791 --> 01:03:54,666
I can't hold this much longer.

951
01:03:54,750 --> 01:03:56,500
Fetcher, quickly!

952
01:03:56,583 --> 01:03:59,041
Find a ledge or a crack to grab hold of!

953
01:03:59,125 --> 01:04:00,125
Righto.

954
01:04:00,666 --> 01:04:02,500
Ooh! Not that crack.

955
01:04:03,958 --> 01:04:05,875
Oh!

956
01:04:08,666 --> 01:04:11,750
Face the facts, duck.

957
01:04:12,250 --> 01:04:14,291
We need a miracle to get out of here.

958
01:04:14,375 --> 01:04:16,833
Hey! Anyone down there?

959
01:04:16,916 --> 01:04:18,101
- Dad!
- Rocky!

960
01:04:18,125 --> 01:04:22,041
Do not tell him he's our miracle.
There'll be no living with him.

961
01:04:22,125 --> 01:04:24,166
Rocky is on the case.

962
01:04:24,250 --> 01:04:26,500
No! Don't jump!

963
01:04:26,583 --> 01:04:28,416
What? What's that?

964
01:04:28,500 --> 01:04:31,208
I can't hear you! Wait. I'm comin' down!

965
01:04:31,291 --> 01:04:32,458
Don't jump!

966
01:04:38,375 --> 01:04:40,708
Oh! Family hug!

967
01:04:40,791 --> 01:04:42,625
Oh, I missed you guys.

968
01:04:42,708 --> 01:04:46,541
Okay. Well, let's blow this henhouse
and head home.

969
01:04:52,416 --> 01:04:53,416
Ah.

970
01:04:54,708 --> 01:04:56,291
That's the way out, isn't it?

971
01:04:59,500 --> 01:05:01,125
I am so sorry.

972
01:05:10,125 --> 01:05:12,583
Molly, what's wrong?

973
01:05:12,666 --> 01:05:14,333
This is all my fault.

974
01:05:14,833 --> 01:05:18,666
I should have listened to you
and done what I was told.

975
01:05:18,750 --> 01:05:20,958
Now everything is a mess.

976
01:05:24,833 --> 01:05:29,208
Hey, where's my big, brave girl?

977
01:05:29,291 --> 01:05:31,791
That girl's stupid.

978
01:05:32,708 --> 01:05:34,000
You were right.

979
01:05:34,083 --> 01:05:38,708
If we ever get home, I'll just stay there
and never leave. Ever.

980
01:05:39,208 --> 01:05:40,916
Hey, no. Molly.

981
01:05:41,416 --> 01:05:42,791
This is my fault.

982
01:05:43,291 --> 01:05:48,958
I should not have told you all
of that ridiculous Lone Free Ranger stuff.

983
01:05:50,458 --> 01:05:52,916
No, this is on me.

984
01:05:54,083 --> 01:05:55,916
I used to hate being fenced in.

985
01:05:56,625 --> 01:05:59,083
So why did I expect you
to be any different?

986
01:06:00,333 --> 01:06:02,875
I guess I was afraid
you were so much like me.

987
01:06:04,125 --> 01:06:06,333
What's wrong with being like you?

988
01:06:11,958 --> 01:06:13,000
Nothing.

989
01:06:13,083 --> 01:06:15,833
Because your mom is the best.

990
01:06:16,333 --> 01:06:19,083
And she always has a plan.

991
01:06:20,750 --> 01:06:22,041
Not this time.

992
01:06:23,833 --> 01:06:25,583
He's here.

993
01:06:27,625 --> 01:06:29,708
Are we ready to fry, Fry?

994
01:06:29,791 --> 01:06:31,375
Five minutes, pumpkin.

995
01:06:31,458 --> 01:06:33,541
- Make it four.
- Oh.

996
01:06:33,625 --> 01:06:35,250
Where is she?

997
01:06:35,333 --> 01:06:36,583
Hmm?

998
01:06:36,666 --> 01:06:41,083
Them runaway chickens, uh,
have got themselves stuck in a corn silo.

999
01:06:41,708 --> 01:06:43,708
In the silo, you say?

1000
01:06:44,208 --> 01:06:47,166
Excellent. I'll go and greet our guest.

1001
01:06:47,250 --> 01:06:49,416
Production starts in three minutes.

1002
01:06:49,500 --> 01:06:50,875
Three?

1003
01:06:50,958 --> 01:06:55,041
Looks like you've just run out of cluck,
little chickens.

1004
01:07:03,041 --> 01:07:04,208
Huh?

1005
01:07:04,291 --> 01:07:05,291
Huh?

1006
01:07:05,791 --> 01:07:06,791
Huh?

1007
01:07:11,208 --> 01:07:13,666
I think there's a grinder
at the bottom of this thing.

1008
01:07:13,750 --> 01:07:16,625
On the plus side, though,
we will all probably drown

1009
01:07:16,708 --> 01:07:18,666
before we're ground into tiny, wee pieces.

1010
01:07:18,750 --> 01:07:20,500
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

1011
01:07:20,583 --> 01:07:22,333
Popcorn.

1012
01:07:22,416 --> 01:07:25,208
Popcorn, everyone. Look.
Look, popcorn.

1013
01:07:25,291 --> 01:07:28,250
Rocky, I don't think this is the time to...

1014
01:07:30,625 --> 01:07:31,958
Ah.

1015
01:07:33,833 --> 01:07:36,583
The answer to all life's problems.

1016
01:07:36,666 --> 01:07:37,708
Of course.

1017
01:07:37,791 --> 01:07:39,916
Mac, we need heat.

1018
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:41,625
- Lots of it.
- Oh.

1019
01:07:42,375 --> 01:07:43,833
Will this work?

1020
01:07:43,916 --> 01:07:45,708
Perfect.

1021
01:07:46,541 --> 01:07:48,541
Now, does anyone have a match?

1022
01:07:48,625 --> 01:07:51,000
Yeah, you and a raving lunatic.

1023
01:07:51,083 --> 01:07:53,291
You'll blow us all to bits.

1024
01:07:56,541 --> 01:07:59,458
Besides, we've used the last one.

1025
01:08:00,875 --> 01:08:02,375
Oh no.

1026
01:08:11,125 --> 01:08:13,375
That's my girl.

1027
01:08:16,000 --> 01:08:20,041
Um, can I once again raise
my health and safety concerns?

1028
01:08:20,625 --> 01:08:21,625
What is it?

1029
01:08:23,541 --> 01:08:25,625
Huh?

1030
01:08:28,958 --> 01:08:30,000
All right.

1031
01:08:33,083 --> 01:08:34,083
Oh!

1032
01:08:36,750 --> 01:08:38,541
Mm. That tastes nice.

1033
01:08:38,625 --> 01:08:39,958
Is there any more?

1034
01:08:50,833 --> 01:08:52,125
But guess what?

1035
01:08:52,208 --> 01:08:55,916
Just as Whizzbang Charlie
thought we were back in Blighty,

1036
01:08:56,000 --> 01:08:58,291
enemy fire at six o'clock.

1037
01:08:58,375 --> 01:09:01,791
Ye gods. It's raining popcorn?

1038
01:09:01,875 --> 01:09:03,791
Good old British weather.

1039
01:09:03,875 --> 01:09:04,958
Unpredictable.

1040
01:09:05,041 --> 01:09:06,458
You never know what's coming.

1041
01:09:09,083 --> 01:09:11,000
Outrageous.

1042
01:09:19,375 --> 01:09:20,750
Hmm?

1043
01:09:22,125 --> 01:09:24,125
- Get in there!
- We made it.

1044
01:09:24,208 --> 01:09:25,875
- Look.
- Whoo-hoo!

1045
01:09:25,958 --> 01:09:29,750
Fowler's only gone
and set up our escape route.

1046
01:09:30,291 --> 01:09:34,375
Well done, you old sausage.

1047
01:09:34,458 --> 01:09:36,791
Firm handshake will do, thank you.

1048
01:09:36,875 --> 01:09:41,708
Mission accomplished.
Now let's fly this crazy coop, huh?

1049
01:09:42,208 --> 01:09:43,208
Oh yes.

1050
01:09:45,500 --> 01:09:46,666
Oh, look, Nick.

1051
01:09:47,583 --> 01:09:49,333
Have we got snacks for the way home?

1052
01:10:03,541 --> 01:10:05,250
All right. On you go.

1053
01:10:09,458 --> 01:10:10,833
Mm.

1054
01:10:13,250 --> 01:10:15,250
Ginger, are you coming?

1055
01:10:17,166 --> 01:10:18,375
No, I'm not.

1056
01:10:20,166 --> 01:10:21,291
I'm going back.

1057
01:10:25,166 --> 01:10:26,333
For Frizzle?

1058
01:10:28,000 --> 01:10:31,250
For Frizzle and all the chickens.

1059
01:10:33,750 --> 01:10:35,791
Yes!

1060
01:10:38,958 --> 01:10:44,375
Just because where we live is cut off
from the world doesn't mean we are too.

1061
01:10:47,833 --> 01:10:49,833
No chicken is an island.

1062
01:10:52,166 --> 01:10:53,291
Hmm.

1063
01:10:53,375 --> 01:10:55,166
We are with you, Ginger.

1064
01:10:55,250 --> 01:10:57,125
Aye, me too.

1065
01:10:57,208 --> 01:10:58,583
Me four.

1066
01:10:58,666 --> 01:10:59,708
The rats are in.

1067
01:11:01,041 --> 01:11:02,833
Right. What's the plan, Mum?

1068
01:11:03,708 --> 01:11:08,541
Oh, well, I didn't think you...

1069
01:11:09,666 --> 01:11:10,666
Rocky.

1070
01:11:11,083 --> 01:11:15,750
Hey, Molly, um,
are you sure you're ready for this?

1071
01:11:15,833 --> 01:11:18,125
I was hatched ready, Dad.

1072
01:11:20,000 --> 01:11:21,666
She is a lot like me.

1073
01:11:32,375 --> 01:11:33,666
Dr. Fry!

1074
01:11:33,750 --> 01:11:35,750
What was that noise up on the roof?

1075
01:11:35,833 --> 01:11:38,041
Sounded like an explosion.

1076
01:11:38,125 --> 01:11:41,916
{\an8}Looks like one of the silos
has blown its top.

1077
01:11:42,000 --> 01:11:43,458
{\an8}Oh.

1078
01:11:43,541 --> 01:11:45,458
Maybe you shouldn't have put
those chickens

1079
01:11:45,541 --> 01:11:47,500
through the grinder, my love.

1080
01:11:47,583 --> 01:11:49,208
Don't be ridiculous.

1081
01:11:49,291 --> 01:11:51,916
Melisha,
all ready for the big day?

1082
01:11:54,458 --> 01:11:56,333
Oh yes, Reginald.

1083
01:11:56,416 --> 01:11:58,208
Everything is tickety-boo.

1084
01:11:58,291 --> 01:12:01,041
Jolly good.
My truck is ready to go.

1085
01:12:01,125 --> 01:12:02,875
We've got to move fast.

1086
01:12:02,958 --> 01:12:05,166
While Tweedy is busy
with her guest outside,

1087
01:12:05,250 --> 01:12:07,250
<i>we sneak back in.</i>

1088
01:12:07,333 --> 01:12:10,916
<i>Molly, you take Bunty, Babs and Mac
to where all the chickens are.</i>

1089
01:12:11,000 --> 01:12:12,083
Come on.

1090
01:12:12,583 --> 01:12:14,375
- This way.
- Ah.

1091
01:12:14,458 --> 01:12:16,125
<i>Stay out of sight</i>

1092
01:12:16,208 --> 01:12:19,666
<i>and get ready to stop
the chickens going up that staircase.</i>

1093
01:12:20,166 --> 01:12:22,833
<i>Rocky, we've got
to get hold of that button.</i>

1094
01:12:22,916 --> 01:12:25,208
<i>And disable those collars.</i>

1095
01:12:26,333 --> 01:12:28,125
<i>As soon as the collars are off,</i>

1096
01:12:28,208 --> 01:12:31,083
<i>Molly's team leads the chickens
out of there.</i>

1097
01:12:31,750 --> 01:12:34,208
<i>We bust our way out.</i>

1098
01:12:34,791 --> 01:12:36,208
<i>Steal the truck,</i>

1099
01:12:36,291 --> 01:12:37,958
then we're home free.

1100
01:12:38,458 --> 01:12:40,208
Well, what are we waiting for?

1101
01:12:40,291 --> 01:12:43,375
- All right. Let's do this.
- We're doing it today, are we?

1102
01:12:44,125 --> 01:12:46,291
So where was I? Ah, yes.

1103
01:12:46,375 --> 01:12:48,666
Whizzbang Charlie had lost
his undercarriage,

1104
01:12:48,750 --> 01:12:51,458
and the old crate was catching fire...

1105
01:12:53,541 --> 01:12:57,583
Actually, Melisha,
I have a little something for our big day.

1106
01:12:58,375 --> 01:13:02,500
Why, Reginald,
this is all very sudden.

1107
01:13:03,000 --> 01:13:04,958
Uh...

1108
01:13:05,041 --> 01:13:06,041
Ketchup?

1109
01:13:06,125 --> 01:13:07,583
Oh. No, no.

1110
01:13:07,666 --> 01:13:09,666
Something completely new.

1111
01:13:10,166 --> 01:13:12,833
I call it "the dip."

1112
01:13:16,958 --> 01:13:19,666
It's... sweet.

1113
01:13:19,750 --> 01:13:22,125
And sour.

1114
01:13:22,208 --> 01:13:25,041
Aren't we all, Reginald?

1115
01:13:25,125 --> 01:13:26,805
<i>Dr. Fry?</i>

1116
01:13:29,458 --> 01:13:31,041
Yes, my beloved?

1117
01:13:31,125 --> 01:13:33,708
Say those words I am longing to hear.

1118
01:13:33,791 --> 01:13:36,000
<i>Get on with it, you idiot.</i>

1119
01:13:37,083 --> 01:13:38,791
Ooh.

1120
01:13:49,833 --> 01:13:53,583
It's the funky chicken
and the ginger one too.

1121
01:13:53,666 --> 01:13:57,333
Oh no, my wife
will not be happy with this.

1122
01:13:57,833 --> 01:14:03,250
Come on here now,
you naughty little chickens!

1123
01:14:12,750 --> 01:14:14,666
Oh dear.

1124
01:14:14,750 --> 01:14:18,458
See you on the flip side, egghead.
You get it?

1125
01:14:18,541 --> 01:14:21,583
<i>Dr. Fry? What's going on up there?</i>

1126
01:14:21,666 --> 01:14:22,708
Quick. Come on.

1127
01:14:23,291 --> 01:14:26,041
<i>Dr. Fry! Dr. Fry!</i>

1128
01:14:26,125 --> 01:14:27,833
- Hello?
<i>- Dr. Fry!</i>

1129
01:14:27,916 --> 01:14:29,875
- Anybody there?
<i>- Dr. Fry!</i>

1130
01:14:29,958 --> 01:14:31,875
Dr. Fry!

1131
01:14:31,958 --> 01:14:33,333
Where are my nuggets?

1132
01:14:33,416 --> 01:14:37,916
Honestly, that man is about
as much use as a headless...

1133
01:14:41,875 --> 01:14:43,291
Chicken!

1134
01:14:48,291 --> 01:14:49,208
Ha ha!

1135
01:14:49,291 --> 01:14:50,208
Huh?

1136
01:14:55,000 --> 01:14:56,000
Huh?

1137
01:14:59,583 --> 01:15:02,375
Let's make some nuggets.

1138
01:15:02,458 --> 01:15:03,625
Oh no.

1139
01:15:05,625 --> 01:15:08,500
Huh?

1140
01:15:12,708 --> 01:15:14,541
Ah!

1141
01:15:14,625 --> 01:15:16,708
No. This is not good, Mac.

1142
01:15:22,000 --> 01:15:25,541
- Oh, Frizzle. Where are you?
- Ooh!

1143
01:15:25,625 --> 01:15:28,583
My turn. Bye-bye.

1144
01:15:29,083 --> 01:15:30,541
Frizzle!

1145
01:15:31,333 --> 01:15:34,250
Lovely sunshine.

1146
01:15:34,333 --> 01:15:36,458
- No, wait.
- Hold on to her.

1147
01:15:38,166 --> 01:15:40,458
<i>♪ We're goin' where the sea is blue ♪</i>

1148
01:15:40,541 --> 01:15:41,541
Mac, hurry.

1149
01:15:41,583 --> 01:15:45,375
- Ooh!
<i>- ♪ We've seen it in the movies... ♪</i>

1150
01:15:48,833 --> 01:15:50,666
I got it. I got it.

1151
01:15:50,750 --> 01:15:53,333
I don't got it!

1152
01:15:54,000 --> 01:15:54,833
Rocky.

1153
01:16:03,750 --> 01:16:04,625
Huh?

1154
01:16:04,708 --> 01:16:07,333
<i>♪ For me and you ♪</i>

1155
01:16:08,791 --> 01:16:10,708
Go, Ginger!

1156
01:16:17,083 --> 01:16:21,291
<i>♪ We're all goin' on a summer holiday ♪</i>

1157
01:16:21,375 --> 01:16:23,601
<i>♪ No more workin' for a week or two... ♪</i>

1158
01:16:23,625 --> 01:16:26,791
Come on, everybody.
We're goin' on holiday.

1159
01:16:26,875 --> 01:16:28,250
No, Babs.

1160
01:16:28,333 --> 01:16:30,958
They're going to turn everyone
into nuggets.

1161
01:16:32,333 --> 01:16:34,750
<i>♪ For a week or two ♪</i>

1162
01:16:35,416 --> 01:16:38,458
<i>♪ We're going
Where the sun shines brightly... ♪</i>

1163
01:16:38,541 --> 01:16:40,458
Not now, mate.

1164
01:16:40,541 --> 01:16:42,666
<i>♪ Where the sea is blue ♪</i>

1165
01:16:42,750 --> 01:16:44,375
<i>♪ We've seen it in the movies ♪</i>

1166
01:16:44,458 --> 01:16:45,750
Please, Mac. Hurry.

1167
01:16:45,833 --> 01:16:46,875
Nearly done.

1168
01:16:46,958 --> 01:16:50,541
Just one more bit of jiggerypokery, and...

1169
01:16:52,416 --> 01:16:55,916
What happened? What's goin' on?

1170
01:16:56,000 --> 01:16:58,083
Frizzle, this isn't the best place ever.

1171
01:16:58,166 --> 01:16:59,286
You only get your own bucket

1172
01:16:59,333 --> 01:17:01,416
when they've chopped you up
and cooked you.

1173
01:17:05,166 --> 01:17:07,250
And you came back for me?

1174
01:17:07,333 --> 01:17:08,833
Of course.

1175
01:17:09,333 --> 01:17:12,250
It's me and you, kidda. All the way.

1176
01:17:12,333 --> 01:17:15,833
Time to go!

1177
01:17:18,833 --> 01:17:21,958
Try to push them back!

1178
01:17:23,541 --> 01:17:25,625
- There's too many!
- Ooh!

1179
01:17:25,708 --> 01:17:28,333
Is this one of the activities?

1180
01:17:36,625 --> 01:17:38,458
Ah!

1181
01:17:38,541 --> 01:17:41,708
Ooh!

1182
01:17:45,500 --> 01:17:47,875
Huh?

1183
01:17:47,958 --> 01:17:49,916
Whee!

1184
01:17:50,000 --> 01:17:52,666
- Whee!
- Whee!

1185
01:17:59,375 --> 01:18:00,541
Mum!

1186
01:18:07,833 --> 01:18:09,125
Ginger!

1187
01:18:11,041 --> 01:18:12,583
Whoo!

1188
01:18:16,916 --> 01:18:20,250
Look. There's all the buckets!

1189
01:18:21,875 --> 01:18:23,875
The button!

1190
01:18:25,875 --> 01:18:26,958
That's it.

1191
01:18:27,041 --> 01:18:29,416
Frizzle, get on Bunty's shoulders.

1192
01:18:29,500 --> 01:18:30,500
What?

1193
01:18:31,166 --> 01:18:32,375
Trust me.

1194
01:18:32,458 --> 01:18:35,041
Up ya get.

1195
01:18:41,125 --> 01:18:43,833
Good goin', Molly.

1196
01:18:43,916 --> 01:18:45,083
Good job, Molly!

1197
01:18:53,458 --> 01:18:54,458
Huh?

1198
01:18:57,750 --> 01:18:58,750
Ah.

1199
01:19:04,875 --> 01:19:05,958
Molly?

1200
01:19:06,708 --> 01:19:08,541
I got this, Dad. Help Mum.

1201
01:19:12,458 --> 01:19:13,500
Uh...

1202
01:19:21,791 --> 01:19:22,791
Molly, watch out.

1203
01:19:23,250 --> 01:19:24,375
Huh?

1204
01:19:24,458 --> 01:19:25,625
Ha!

1205
01:19:29,750 --> 01:19:32,250
What have we here?

1206
01:19:32,333 --> 01:19:35,791
- A little you.
- Mum, catch.

1207
01:19:38,708 --> 01:19:40,958
They're going over, Mum!

1208
01:19:46,625 --> 01:19:48,666
Ginger, we can't hold them!

1209
01:19:52,083 --> 01:19:53,291
Uh...

1210
01:19:53,375 --> 01:19:55,583
Uh-uh-uh!

1211
01:19:55,666 --> 01:19:59,125
{\an8}You can't wait, Mum. Do it now!

1212
01:20:09,541 --> 01:20:10,875
Sometimes...

1213
01:20:13,000 --> 01:20:14,666
you've just got to take a leap.

1214
01:20:20,125 --> 01:20:21,125
No!

1215
01:20:21,208 --> 01:20:24,833
- Cock-a-doodle-doo!
- Huh?

1216
01:20:29,416 --> 01:20:31,166
- Huh?
- Ah!

1217
01:20:37,250 --> 01:20:39,333
No! No! No!

1218
01:20:45,458 --> 01:20:48,291
Oh!

1219
01:20:48,375 --> 01:20:49,416
Ginger!

1220
01:20:55,625 --> 01:20:57,041
Ah.

1221
01:20:57,125 --> 01:20:59,416
I got ya. I got ya.

1222
01:20:59,500 --> 01:21:01,416
Well, now.

1223
01:21:02,458 --> 01:21:07,083
I suppose you three
might make a bucketful.

1224
01:21:12,583 --> 01:21:13,666
Hmm?

1225
01:21:14,250 --> 01:21:15,625
Bye-bye.

1226
01:21:15,708 --> 01:21:16,833
Again.

1227
01:21:16,916 --> 01:21:18,375
Huh?

1228
01:21:40,250 --> 01:21:41,250
Come on.

1229
01:21:41,791 --> 01:21:44,458
Ugh. What's taking so long?

1230
01:21:44,541 --> 01:21:46,708
So much for fast food.

1231
01:21:46,791 --> 01:21:48,541
Hmm.

1232
01:21:49,833 --> 01:21:51,208
Ah.

1233
01:21:51,291 --> 01:21:53,291
That's funny. Sounds like a...

1234
01:21:53,375 --> 01:21:55,375
...stampede!

1235
01:21:55,458 --> 01:21:57,583
- Get your skates on.
- Move your tail feathers.

1236
01:21:57,666 --> 01:21:59,166
- Come on.
- Come on!

1237
01:22:01,791 --> 01:22:03,958
You sure you know how this works?

1238
01:22:04,041 --> 01:22:05,208
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1239
01:22:05,291 --> 01:22:07,791
Go, stop, and a spare one?

1240
01:22:07,875 --> 01:22:09,541
Come on! We have to go!

1241
01:22:09,625 --> 01:22:10,958
Full speed ahead!

1242
01:22:13,541 --> 01:22:14,583
Wrong way!

1243
01:22:14,666 --> 01:22:15,958
What gear are you in?

1244
01:22:16,041 --> 01:22:17,958
Oh, I call this "smart casual."

1245
01:22:25,250 --> 01:22:27,958
Ah, you there!

1246
01:22:28,041 --> 01:22:32,166
What kind of crazy henhouse is this?

1247
01:22:32,250 --> 01:22:33,708
Oh.

1248
01:22:33,791 --> 01:22:35,458
Melisha?

1249
01:22:35,958 --> 01:22:38,250
Why are you dressed like a nugget?

1250
01:22:44,958 --> 01:22:46,166
There's the exit!

1251
01:22:51,625 --> 01:22:54,000
Get her off!

1252
01:22:56,791 --> 01:22:59,083
Hmm?

1253
01:23:08,625 --> 01:23:10,708
I think they're gonna need
a bigger bucket.

1254
01:23:16,625 --> 01:23:23,083
- Chocks away!
- Huh?

1255
01:23:23,166 --> 01:23:25,041
Ha ha!

1256
01:23:42,208 --> 01:23:45,458
T.I. Fowler, Getaway Division.

1257
01:23:45,541 --> 01:23:47,208
Reporting for duty.

1258
01:23:47,291 --> 01:23:49,708
{\an8}Where would we be without you, Fowler?

1259
01:23:51,333 --> 01:23:53,500
Darling! Darling!

1260
01:23:54,875 --> 01:23:57,166
- Blech.
- Darling!

1261
01:23:57,250 --> 01:23:59,916
The processor is dangerously overheating.

1262
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:01,500
Oh.

1263
01:24:01,583 --> 01:24:04,291
Huh?

1264
01:24:07,833 --> 01:24:08,833
Uh...

1265
01:24:08,916 --> 01:24:11,458
Pumpkin, watch out for the, uh...

1266
01:24:20,791 --> 01:24:22,541
- Oh blast!
- What?

1267
01:24:22,625 --> 01:24:24,916
I think I left my umbrella
in there.

1268
01:24:51,250 --> 01:24:56,875
Oh! The best thing about going on holiday
is getting back home, isn't it?

1269
01:24:56,958 --> 01:25:00,541
Yes, it is. Isn't it, Babs?

1270
01:25:00,625 --> 01:25:02,416
Ooh!

1271
01:25:02,500 --> 01:25:03,666
- Oh!
- All fixed.

1272
01:25:03,750 --> 01:25:05,375
Just had a screw loose.

1273
01:25:11,000 --> 01:25:14,625
Good to have a bucket or two handy
in case you're feeling peckish.

1274
01:25:14,708 --> 01:25:16,458
Plenty for everyone.

1275
01:25:17,333 --> 01:25:19,625
This makes you happy
and brainless, apparently.

1276
01:25:19,708 --> 01:25:21,791
Oh yeah, I feel it.

1277
01:25:21,875 --> 01:25:24,708
It's amazin'.

1278
01:25:24,791 --> 01:25:27,250
Mate, I haven't turned it on yet.

1279
01:25:30,333 --> 01:25:34,458
Well, it looks like we've finally got
our happy ending.

1280
01:25:34,541 --> 01:25:37,833
Ah, let's just call this
our happy beginning.

1281
01:25:44,166 --> 01:25:46,875
Sergeant Molly,
reporting from reconnaissance.

1282
01:25:46,958 --> 01:25:48,875
Chicken farm, beyond the north field.

1283
01:25:48,958 --> 01:25:51,041
Thirty birds to a cage.

1284
01:25:51,125 --> 01:25:52,708
Poor little kiddas.

1285
01:25:56,125 --> 01:25:57,250
Right, everyone.

1286
01:26:02,041 --> 01:26:04,041
I don't like this one bit.

1287
01:26:04,125 --> 01:26:06,083
It's go time.

1288
01:26:06,958 --> 01:26:08,500
I've just got one question.

1289
01:26:09,000 --> 01:26:10,708
Is crowing back on the agenda?

1290
01:26:10,791 --> 01:26:12,291
Oh, definitely.

1291
01:26:12,791 --> 01:26:13,875
Ready, everyone?

1292
01:26:14,375 --> 01:26:16,541
- Ready!
- Ready!

1293
01:26:16,625 --> 01:26:19,666
