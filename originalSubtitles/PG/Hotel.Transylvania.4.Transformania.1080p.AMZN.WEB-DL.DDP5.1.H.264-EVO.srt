Here's to Hotel Transylvania!

36
00:02:47,418 --> 00:02:51,088
Celebrating 125 years!

37
00:02:51,171 --> 00:02:53,007
Hear! Hear!

38
00:02:53,090 --> 00:02:54,633
- Way to go, Drac!
- Well done!

39
00:02:54,717 --> 00:02:56,468
Yes.

40
00:02:56,552 --> 00:02:58,053
So great.

41
00:02:58,137 --> 00:02:59,680
Thank you, Johnny.

42
00:02:59,763 --> 00:03:02,182
What a wonderful surprise that was.

43
00:03:02,266 --> 00:03:04,560
But now it's time to start

44
00:03:04,643 --> 00:03:07,730
the actual planned part
of the celebration.

45
00:03:07,813 --> 00:03:10,107
- That was only the beginning, Drac.
- Huh?

46
00:03:10,190 --> 00:03:13,611
You just sit back and enjoy
your anniversary party.

47
00:03:13,694 --> 00:03:15,112
Relax, Dad.

48
00:03:15,195 --> 00:03:17,781
Johnny worked so hard
to make this extra special.

49
00:03:17,865 --> 00:03:19,617
He has everything under control.

50
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:20,701
Oh, no.

51
00:03:20,784 --> 00:03:23,871
It's a Johnny takeover celebration!

52
00:03:23,954 --> 00:03:25,205
Hit it!

53
00:03:30,628 --> 00:03:32,963
- Send in the dogs!
- Dogs?

54
00:03:35,299 --> 00:03:37,801
Happy hotel anniversary, Papa Drac!

55
00:03:40,930 --> 00:03:42,473
Good boy.

56
00:03:42,556 --> 00:03:45,309
Let's do it, Frank!

57
00:03:48,228 --> 00:03:50,564
Isn't this great? Johnny taught me!

58
00:03:50,648 --> 00:03:54,151
And we only had to replace
his hands twice during rehearsals.

59
00:03:54,234 --> 00:03:56,111
Ice sculpture, go!

60
00:03:59,907 --> 00:04:02,368
Pyrotechnics!

61
00:04:05,704 --> 00:04:07,706
Oh, yeah!

62
00:04:12,294 --> 00:04:14,421
"Very phine a..."

63
00:04:14,505 --> 00:04:15,965
Ooh! Oh, no!

64
00:04:17,716 --> 00:04:18,717
Oh! Huh?

65
00:04:21,345 --> 00:04:22,638
Fire!

66
00:04:23,931 --> 00:04:24,932
Oh, that's not good.

67
00:04:33,565 --> 00:04:35,359
Okay, that's enough.

68
00:04:41,281 --> 00:04:42,241
Wh...

69
00:04:42,324 --> 00:04:44,702
Uh, Dad?

70
00:04:46,704 --> 00:04:49,206
Oh, right.
Can't freeze other vampires.

71
00:04:49,289 --> 00:04:51,166
Oh, hey, Mavey Wavey!

72
00:04:51,250 --> 00:04:55,170
Just making a couple of tiny adjustments.

73
00:04:55,254 --> 00:04:59,466
Dad, Johnny did all of this for you.

74
00:04:59,550 --> 00:05:01,343
He was trying to make this day special.

75
00:05:01,427 --> 00:05:04,888
Oh, you mean
by ruining my carefully planned party.

76
00:05:04,972 --> 00:05:07,349
Wow, thank you, dear son-in-law.

77
00:05:07,433 --> 00:05:10,019
- What was that?
- Oh, hey, nothing, honeybat.

78
00:05:14,231 --> 00:05:17,818
Dad, I know you and Johnny
don't always see eye to eye,

79
00:05:17,901 --> 00:05:20,696
but I love him
and I wouldn't change a thing.

80
00:05:20,779 --> 00:05:21,989
Really?

81
00:05:22,072 --> 00:05:25,159
You sure you wouldn't make
just a few teensy changes?

82
00:05:26,368 --> 00:05:28,537
- Better, no?
- No!

83
00:05:29,413 --> 00:05:31,874
He's perfect just the way he is.

84
00:05:31,957 --> 00:05:33,584
Okay, okay.

85
00:05:33,667 --> 00:05:35,294
Whatever you say, honeybat.

86
00:05:35,377 --> 00:05:38,964
Now, let's continue this special day,

87
00:05:39,048 --> 00:05:41,383
'cause it's gonna get
even more specialier.

88
00:05:41,467 --> 00:05:43,385
All right, what are you up to?

89
00:05:43,469 --> 00:05:45,971
What, me? Nothing.

90
00:05:48,432 --> 00:05:50,476
Huh? Oh.

91
00:05:56,607 --> 00:05:57,649
Whoa.

92
00:05:57,733 --> 00:05:59,234
I guess I killed it.

93
00:05:59,318 --> 00:06:01,236
All right, next up, we got...

94
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:02,613
Thank you, Johnny.

95
00:06:02,696 --> 00:06:03,947
How wonderful.

96
00:06:04,031 --> 00:06:07,159
And don't forget, precisely at midnight,

97
00:06:07,242 --> 00:06:11,038
I will make a special
once-in-a-lifetime announcement!

98
00:06:11,121 --> 00:06:13,248
In the meantime,
sit back and enjoy the band.

99
00:06:23,967 --> 00:06:26,637
Yoo-hoo! You ready for
your big speech, honeyfangs?

100
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:28,680
Yes, I think so.

101
00:06:28,764 --> 00:06:33,352
But Johnny is
giving me the greatest headache

102
00:06:33,435 --> 00:06:35,646
of my entire existence right now,

103
00:06:35,729 --> 00:06:39,483
like a giant wooden stake
right through my brain!

104
00:06:39,566 --> 00:06:40,692
Oh, you know Johnny.

105
00:06:40,776 --> 00:06:42,236
He just gets a little carried away.

106
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:43,987
Yes, exactly.

107
00:06:44,071 --> 00:06:45,280
And ruins everything.

108
00:06:45,364 --> 00:06:46,657
That's the problem.

109
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:48,951
Well, you're gonna have to
get used to things being done

110
00:06:49,034 --> 00:06:51,036
a little differently around here
when you retire.

111
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:52,121
Shh!

112
00:06:52,204 --> 00:06:55,499
...when you retire.

113
00:06:55,582 --> 00:06:57,126
Retire?

114
00:06:57,209 --> 00:06:58,544
Not so loud.

115
00:06:58,627 --> 00:07:00,337
Mavis has supersonic hearing.

116
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:01,588
Why would she be listening?

117
00:07:01,672 --> 00:07:03,257
Don't be so paranoid.

118
00:07:03,340 --> 00:07:05,717
Yes, I-I'm sure you're right.

119
00:07:05,801 --> 00:07:09,930
I just... I don't want
anything else to go wrong.

120
00:07:10,013 --> 00:07:12,266
Everything has to be perfect

121
00:07:12,349 --> 00:07:15,894
when I finally give the hotel to Mavis.

122
00:07:15,978 --> 00:07:17,521
What?!

123
00:07:17,604 --> 00:07:19,022
And Johnny.

124
00:07:19,106 --> 00:07:20,899
Yes, and Johnny.

125
00:07:20,983 --> 00:07:23,152
Oh, it is a big step.

126
00:07:23,235 --> 00:07:25,988
I know how much this hotel means to you.

127
00:07:26,071 --> 00:07:30,367
Ah, yes, but it is time to let go

128
00:07:30,450 --> 00:07:33,704
and start a new chapter, together.

129
00:07:33,787 --> 00:07:37,207
Well, you are just all sorts
of wonderful, aren't you?

130
00:07:37,291 --> 00:07:41,503
Well, it's not for nothing
that they call me

131
00:07:41,587 --> 00:07:43,463
Count Wonderful.

132
00:07:43,547 --> 00:07:45,632
Oh. Do they?

133
00:07:45,716 --> 00:07:48,969
And also
Dark Prince of Loveliness.

134
00:07:49,052 --> 00:07:50,387
Mm-hmm.

135
00:07:50,470 --> 00:07:53,182
Lord of Smoochy Time.

136
00:07:54,516 --> 00:07:56,101
Oh, stop it, Drac.

137
00:07:57,394 --> 00:08:00,147
Ew, ew. Ew-ew-ew-ew-ew-ew.

138
00:08:00,230 --> 00:08:01,857
Whoa, cute ear, hon.

139
00:08:01,940 --> 00:08:03,692
Holy rabies. Holy rabies!

140
00:08:03,775 --> 00:08:05,068
You're never gonna believe it!

141
00:08:05,152 --> 00:08:06,528
What? What's going on?

142
00:08:06,612 --> 00:08:09,156
Johnny, you better sit down for this.

143
00:08:09,239 --> 00:08:10,908
Babe, you're freaking me out here.

144
00:08:10,991 --> 00:08:13,327
Dad is gonna retire

145
00:08:13,410 --> 00:08:15,495
and leave us the hotel!

146
00:08:26,506 --> 00:08:28,217
He's okay. He's okay.

147
00:08:28,300 --> 00:08:30,260
Just a-a little too much sugar.

148
00:08:30,344 --> 00:08:31,595
Whoa.

149
00:08:31,678 --> 00:08:33,722
I didn't even know
he was thinking of retiring.

150
00:08:33,805 --> 00:08:35,265
Shh. Neither did I.

151
00:08:35,349 --> 00:08:37,768
Oh, my gosh, Mavis, I'm so happy for you.

152
00:08:37,851 --> 00:08:39,436
You're gonna be amazing!

153
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:41,605
You mean we're going to be amazing.

154
00:08:41,688 --> 00:08:44,024
Dad's leaving the hotel to both of us.

155
00:08:44,107 --> 00:08:45,317
Really?

156
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:46,526
Both of us?

157
00:08:46,610 --> 00:08:47,694
Are you sure?

158
00:08:47,778 --> 00:08:49,613
Of course. Why wouldn't he?

159
00:08:49,696 --> 00:08:51,531
Oh, uh, I don't know.

160
00:08:51,615 --> 00:08:53,867
I-I guess I just never got the feeling

161
00:08:53,951 --> 00:08:56,286
that he really thought of me as, you know,

162
00:08:56,370 --> 00:08:57,746
part of the family.

163
00:08:57,829 --> 00:08:59,915
What are you talking about?

164
00:08:59,998 --> 00:09:01,500
Of course you're part of the family.

165
00:09:01,583 --> 00:09:06,922
No, I know, but you know
how Cranky Fangs is sometimes.

166
00:09:07,005 --> 00:09:10,425
I mean, it feels like I am,
but not really.

167
00:09:10,509 --> 00:09:11,718
That's not true.

168
00:09:11,802 --> 00:09:13,679
Well, not anymore it isn't!

169
00:09:13,762 --> 00:09:15,013
Shh.

170
00:09:15,097 --> 00:09:16,890
We can't spoil the surprise.

171
00:09:16,974 --> 00:09:18,934
Right. Right, right, right,
right, right, right.

172
00:09:19,017 --> 00:09:21,144
I better walk this off.

173
00:09:21,228 --> 00:09:23,105
Hey, how's it going? Nothing to see.

174
00:09:23,188 --> 00:09:25,357
Nothing much to talk about,
except for the greatest thing

175
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:27,442
happening in the entire universe.

176
00:09:27,526 --> 00:09:29,403
Oh, oh, there he is.

177
00:09:29,486 --> 00:09:31,071
Hey, Drac! Hey, Drac!

178
00:09:31,154 --> 00:09:32,614
Oh, no. No.

179
00:09:32,698 --> 00:09:34,032
Just keep it cool, Johnny.

180
00:09:34,116 --> 00:09:38,745
There will be plenty of time
to thank him after.

181
00:09:44,918 --> 00:09:46,461
All right, let's see here.

182
00:09:46,545 --> 00:09:49,673
Uh, dearest family, friends...

183
00:09:49,756 --> 00:09:51,967
and, uh, and honored guests,

184
00:09:52,050 --> 00:09:55,512
I have started a new phase in my life,

185
00:09:55,595 --> 00:09:59,308
and I feel it is time
to begin a new chapter

186
00:09:59,391 --> 00:10:01,143
for Hotel Transylvania.

187
00:10:01,226 --> 00:10:04,563
So, I am extremely proud

188
00:10:04,646 --> 00:10:08,191
and honored to give
the key to the hotel to...

189
00:10:08,275 --> 00:10:10,360
Drac!

190
00:10:10,444 --> 00:10:11,862
I can't believe it. I can't believe it.

191
00:10:11,945 --> 00:10:13,572
I'm gonna explode into
a thousand little excited bits.

192
00:10:13,655 --> 00:10:15,407
And then those little excited bits
are gonna explode into

193
00:10:15,490 --> 00:10:17,200
millions of tiny little excited bits!

194
00:10:17,284 --> 00:10:19,536
- What?
- Oh, mighty king,

195
00:10:19,619 --> 00:10:23,332
it is with all my heart
that I accept this great honor.

196
00:10:23,415 --> 00:10:25,083
- Honor?
- With this mighty key,

197
00:10:25,167 --> 00:10:28,879
I will unlock the future
and usher in a new destiny

198
00:10:28,962 --> 00:10:31,590
for the great Hotel Transylvania!

199
00:10:31,673 --> 00:10:33,884
- Yeah?
- Oh! So many great ideas.

200
00:10:33,967 --> 00:10:36,053
I'm dizzy with hospitality creativity.

201
00:10:36,136 --> 00:10:37,596
Like horizontal escalators

202
00:10:37,679 --> 00:10:39,514
all through the lobby,
name tags for all guests

203
00:10:39,598 --> 00:10:41,099
for more casual relations,
green-energy-saving options...

204
00:10:45,979 --> 00:10:48,732
...stationary bikes in every room
for your own power source.

205
00:10:48,815 --> 00:10:52,527
It's gonna be
the ultimate Johnny takeover!

206
00:10:52,611 --> 00:10:54,154
Yah!

207
00:10:54,237 --> 00:10:56,114
I can't do it!

208
00:10:56,198 --> 00:10:58,909
I thought I could give the hotel
to Mavis and Johnny,

209
00:10:58,992 --> 00:11:01,286
but he's going to ruin everything!

210
00:11:03,163 --> 00:11:05,290
I have to get out of this. I have to.

211
00:11:05,374 --> 00:11:06,583
I... I...

212
00:11:06,666 --> 00:11:07,667
Ah!

213
00:11:09,002 --> 00:11:12,422
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,
Sir Johnny.

214
00:11:12,506 --> 00:11:15,884
I think that there has been
a misunderstanding.

215
00:11:15,967 --> 00:11:18,053
I actually...

216
00:11:18,136 --> 00:11:19,679
can't give you the hotel.

217
00:11:19,763 --> 00:11:22,307
- What?
- Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.

218
00:11:22,391 --> 00:11:25,769
It is an old, very, very old,

219
00:11:25,852 --> 00:11:29,689
very ancient, very serious

220
00:11:29,773 --> 00:11:31,858
real estate law!

221
00:11:31,942 --> 00:11:35,028
- Real estate law?
- Yes, yes.

222
00:11:35,112 --> 00:11:36,822
It says,

223
00:11:36,905 --> 00:11:39,574
"No residence, whether it be
residential or commercial,

224
00:11:39,658 --> 00:11:42,536
"shall ever be transferred to,
owned by or inherited

225
00:11:42,619 --> 00:11:44,329
"to a human.

226
00:11:44,413 --> 00:11:47,249
"For if it did, to wit,
then that property shall be

227
00:11:47,332 --> 00:11:50,377
forfeited and repossessed unto it."

228
00:11:50,460 --> 00:11:53,755
Whoa. Those are some serious "its."

229
00:11:53,839 --> 00:11:56,508
I am truly sorry.

230
00:11:56,591 --> 00:11:59,469
I would absolutely love
to give you the hotel,

231
00:11:59,553 --> 00:12:03,056
but, you know,
you're not a monster, so can't.

232
00:12:03,140 --> 00:12:06,226
But then what's the big announcement?

233
00:12:06,309 --> 00:12:08,478
Huh?

234
00:12:12,023 --> 00:12:14,234
Uh, uh...

235
00:12:14,317 --> 00:12:15,944
Excited for the big announcement?

236
00:12:16,027 --> 00:12:18,780
You have no idea.

237
00:12:18,864 --> 00:12:21,283
Oh, think, think, think.

238
00:12:21,366 --> 00:12:23,493
Oh, you've got to announce something.

239
00:12:30,333 --> 00:12:32,711
There you are. You almost missed it.

240
00:12:32,794 --> 00:12:34,713
Uh-huh.

241
00:12:35,922 --> 00:12:37,549
Uh...

242
00:12:37,632 --> 00:12:40,552
Uh, dearest friends and...

243
00:12:42,137 --> 00:12:43,638
What is wrong with him?

244
00:12:43,722 --> 00:12:46,141
- Boy, is he nervous.
- This is hard to watch.

245
00:12:46,224 --> 00:12:47,559
Get on with it!

246
00:12:47,642 --> 00:12:50,145
- Griffin!
- What? He's dying up there.

247
00:12:50,228 --> 00:12:54,107
I know, but you have to be respectful.

248
00:12:55,192 --> 00:12:58,195
Get on with it already!

249
00:12:58,278 --> 00:13:00,489
I...

250
00:13:00,572 --> 00:13:05,452
Dearest family, friends and, uh,
and honored guests,

251
00:13:05,535 --> 00:13:10,707
I... I have started
a new phase, uh, in my life.

252
00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:12,375
Here it comes.

253
00:13:12,459 --> 00:13:18,173
And I feel that now is the time for

254
00:13:18,256 --> 00:13:22,928
Hotel Transylvania to, um...

255
00:13:23,011 --> 00:13:25,388
uh... uh...

256
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:28,934
Oh. Expand!

257
00:13:29,017 --> 00:13:30,060
Yes!

258
00:13:30,143 --> 00:13:32,479
We are expanding the hotel!

259
00:13:32,562 --> 00:13:33,480
What?!

260
00:13:33,563 --> 00:13:34,814
Yes, yes.

261
00:13:34,898 --> 00:13:37,400
In order to address
the increasingly long lines,

262
00:13:37,484 --> 00:13:38,944
I am pleased to announce

263
00:13:39,027 --> 00:13:42,614
we will be adding
a new restroom to the lobby.

264
00:13:44,908 --> 00:13:47,452
Can't never have enough bathrooms.

265
00:13:47,536 --> 00:13:49,955
But...
but I thought I heard...

266
00:13:50,038 --> 00:13:53,375
Oh, man, this is all my fault.

267
00:13:53,458 --> 00:13:56,795
So, let's get on with the party!

268
00:13:56,878 --> 00:13:58,213

before you run into...

295
00:14:54,936 --> 00:14:55,979
Ericka!

296
00:14:56,062 --> 00:14:58,523
Uh, what happened up there?

297
00:14:58,607 --> 00:15:00,275
Oh. Wh-What?

298
00:15:00,358 --> 00:15:01,610
What was that, sweetheart?

299
00:15:01,693 --> 00:15:04,029
The music... it is so booming.

300
00:15:04,112 --> 00:15:05,947
Oh, yeah, feel it, baby.

301
00:15:06,031 --> 00:15:07,032
Drac!

302
00:15:07,115 --> 00:15:08,491
Whew, that was close.

303
00:15:08,575 --> 00:15:10,952
- Mavis!
- A new restroom?

304
00:15:11,036 --> 00:15:12,037
Really, Dad?

305
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:14,205
That was the big surprise?

306
00:15:14,289 --> 00:15:17,250
There wasn't anything else
you were gonna announce?

307
00:15:17,334 --> 00:15:18,376
Like what?

308
00:15:18,460 --> 00:15:22,797
Like... I don't know... your retirement.

309
00:15:22,881 --> 00:15:24,257
What?! Uh...

310
00:15:25,592 --> 00:15:28,762
Oh! Listen to those, uh,
dope-tastic beats.

311
00:15:28,845 --> 00:15:31,348
- Uh, shake a leg, honeybat.
- Dad, wait!

312
00:15:33,516 --> 00:15:36,353
Oh, man, this is all my fault.

313
00:15:36,436 --> 00:15:39,481
I ruined everything,
all because I'm not a monster.

314
00:15:39,564 --> 00:15:42,359
So you want to become a monster, huh?

315
00:15:42,442 --> 00:15:43,485
Van Helsing?

316
00:15:43,568 --> 00:15:45,487
I can help with that.

317
00:15:45,570 --> 00:15:48,782
I've got just the thing down in my lab.

318
00:15:50,283 --> 00:15:51,910
The question is:

319
00:15:51,993 --> 00:15:54,579
Where did I put it?

320
00:15:54,663 --> 00:15:56,956
Whoa.

321
00:16:00,126 --> 00:16:01,127
Ooh.

322
00:16:01,211 --> 00:16:02,796
It's all organized very unique...

323
00:16:02,879 --> 00:16:04,673
- Don't touch anything!
- Sorry.

324
00:16:04,756 --> 00:16:06,091
Not there.

325
00:16:06,174 --> 00:16:07,342
- Whoa.
- Ah, that's not it.

326
00:16:07,425 --> 00:16:09,094
It must be in the back somewhere.

327
00:16:09,177 --> 00:16:11,805
Come on, hurry up!

328
00:16:11,888 --> 00:16:13,723
Right through here.

329
00:16:19,270 --> 00:16:21,189
Keep up! Yeah!

330
00:16:23,566 --> 00:16:25,652
Alley-oop!

331
00:16:25,735 --> 00:16:27,821
Whoa.

332
00:16:30,740 --> 00:16:32,909
I know it's around here somewhere.

333
00:16:35,412 --> 00:16:36,538
Hello?

334
00:16:36,621 --> 00:16:38,331
Van Helsing?

335
00:16:38,415 --> 00:16:39,958
Aha!

336
00:16:40,041 --> 00:16:42,085
Found it!

337
00:16:42,168 --> 00:16:44,754
Behold, the Monsterfication Ray.

338
00:16:44,838 --> 00:16:47,966
It turns any human into a monster.

339
00:16:48,049 --> 00:16:49,467
Awesome!

340
00:16:49,551 --> 00:16:50,885
But is it safe, though?

341
00:16:50,969 --> 00:16:52,053
Great question.

342
00:16:52,137 --> 00:16:54,973
What we need is a guinea pig.

343
00:16:55,056 --> 00:16:56,474
Meet Gigi.

344
00:16:58,351 --> 00:17:00,770
Aw. She's so cute.

345
00:17:00,854 --> 00:17:02,272
Not for long.

346
00:17:11,656 --> 00:17:13,408
Whoa!

347
00:17:13,491 --> 00:17:15,660
Sign me up for teeth like these.

348
00:17:15,744 --> 00:17:19,205
Ooh, and seven eyes
and laser vision and...

349
00:17:19,289 --> 00:17:21,166
Oh, it doesn't work that way.

350
00:17:21,249 --> 00:17:25,044
Who knows what sort of
hideous beast you'll become?

351
00:17:25,128 --> 00:17:26,713
So let's find out.

352
00:17:26,796 --> 00:17:28,089
Don't worry, Mavis.

353
00:17:28,173 --> 00:17:30,592
This is gonna fix everything.

354
00:17:30,675 --> 00:17:32,677
Lay it on me, bro!

355
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:36,681
Huh?

356
00:17:39,017 --> 00:17:40,810
Huh, that's weird.

357
00:17:40,894 --> 00:17:42,020
Nothing happened.

358
00:17:44,105 --> 00:17:46,566
I don't feel so good.

359
00:17:46,649 --> 00:17:48,526
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

360
00:17:52,530 --> 00:17:53,656
Huh?

361
00:18:01,247 --> 00:18:03,291
Uh-oh.

362
00:18:13,384 --> 00:18:14,511
Dad?

363
00:18:15,637 --> 00:18:16,805
Drac?

364
00:18:23,311 --> 00:18:25,438
Honey? Sweetheart?

365
00:18:25,522 --> 00:18:26,648
Dad?

366
00:18:28,358 --> 00:18:29,901
Whew.

367
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:35,990
What is that?

368
00:18:47,627 --> 00:18:49,420
Hello?

369
00:18:49,504 --> 00:18:52,131
Van Helsing?

370
00:18:52,215 --> 00:18:53,758
Is everything okay down here?

371
00:18:53,842 --> 00:18:54,968
Huh?

372
00:18:59,681 --> 00:19:01,474
Hello?

373
00:19:01,558 --> 00:19:03,643
Who's there?

374
00:19:16,698 --> 00:19:18,533
Hey, Drac, what's up?

375
00:19:18,616 --> 00:19:20,618
Wha... uh, Johnny?

376
00:19:20,702 --> 00:19:22,203
Yeah, it's me.

377
00:19:22,287 --> 00:19:23,955
Whoa!

378
00:19:25,456 --> 00:19:27,125
I'm a monster.

379
00:19:27,208 --> 00:19:30,879
Check out these big feet
and these claws... ooh...

380
00:19:30,962 --> 00:19:33,006
and these ears... they're so pointy.

381
00:19:33,089 --> 00:19:35,133
And, look, I've got a tail!

382
00:19:36,634 --> 00:19:38,720
Why...

383
00:19:38,803 --> 00:19:40,763
Why did you... How did you...

384
00:19:40,847 --> 00:19:43,641
I used Van Helsing's monster ray.

385
00:19:43,725 --> 00:19:45,727
Now you can give the hotel
to Mavis and me,

386
00:19:45,810 --> 00:19:46,895
just like you wanted.

387
00:19:46,978 --> 00:19:48,771
Oh, my gosh. Mavis!

388
00:19:48,855 --> 00:19:50,940
She's gonna love the new me.
Let's go show her!

389
00:19:51,024 --> 00:19:52,525
Whoa, whoa, whoa, wait, wait, wait.

390
00:19:52,609 --> 00:19:54,235
Mavis?

391
00:19:54,319 --> 00:19:56,154
Mavis?

392
00:19:59,324 --> 00:20:02,201
Oh, no. Mavis is going to kill me.

393
00:20:04,329 --> 00:20:06,539
Mavis! Mavis?

394
00:20:06,623 --> 00:20:08,207
I'll fix that!

395
00:20:08,291 --> 00:20:09,292
Mavis!

396
00:20:09,375 --> 00:20:11,294
I got great news!

397
00:20:12,378 --> 00:20:13,630
Got ya!

398
00:20:24,557 --> 00:20:26,559
Ooh, pardon me.

399
00:20:27,644 --> 00:20:28,645
What?

400
00:20:28,728 --> 00:20:30,605
I-I can't believe it.

401
00:20:30,688 --> 00:20:32,815
The nightmare... it's over!

402
00:20:32,899 --> 00:20:34,525
I'm human again!

403
00:20:35,568 --> 00:20:37,111
Huh?

404
00:20:39,489 --> 00:20:41,950
I better be careful.
There are monsters everywhere.

405
00:20:43,284 --> 00:20:44,285
Oh, excuse me.

406
00:20:44,369 --> 00:20:45,787
- Coming through.
- No, no, no, no, no!

407
00:20:47,497 --> 00:20:48,748
Mavis?

408
00:20:57,966 --> 00:20:59,175
Mavis?

409
00:21:13,439 --> 00:21:14,774
Mavis?

410
00:21:14,857 --> 00:21:18,528
This is gonna be the coolest surprise
when you see the surprise!

411
00:21:20,321 --> 00:21:22,740
H-Hey! Tinkles!

412
00:21:22,824 --> 00:21:24,325
Hey, Dennis. Hey, Winnie.

413
00:21:24,409 --> 00:21:26,828
Dad? Is that you?

414
00:21:26,911 --> 00:21:28,162
Yeah! Isn't it great?

415
00:21:28,246 --> 00:21:30,331
I got to go show your mom.

416
00:21:35,545 --> 00:21:37,547
Papa Drac, is that my dad?

417
00:21:39,674 --> 00:21:41,759
That was not your father,

418
00:21:41,843 --> 00:21:43,886
just some random monster.

419
00:21:43,970 --> 00:21:46,139
Everything is normal.

420
00:21:46,222 --> 00:21:49,517
Everything is normal.

421
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:53,062
Mavis? Where are you?

422
00:21:55,314 --> 00:21:56,733
The party!

423
00:21:59,777 --> 00:22:02,697
Mavis, I've got the best news ever!

424
00:22:02,780 --> 00:22:04,282
Whoa-oh!

425
00:22:25,386 --> 00:22:26,429
Oh, no.

426
00:22:30,433 --> 00:22:31,559
Drac?

427
00:22:40,777 --> 00:22:42,195
Oh, no!

428
00:22:42,278 --> 00:22:43,613
Something's wrong!

429
00:22:43,696 --> 00:22:44,947
Don't worry!

430
00:22:45,031 --> 00:22:47,408
I got you, Drac!

431
00:22:49,535 --> 00:22:51,037
Hey, Frank, relax.

432
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:52,455
It's not a contest.

433
00:22:54,832 --> 00:22:55,958
- Huh?
- Huh?

434
00:23:01,923 --> 00:23:02,924
Drac?

435
00:23:04,926 --> 00:23:05,927
Hey, guys.

436
00:23:06,010 --> 00:23:07,220
Johnny?

437
00:23:07,303 --> 00:23:08,304
Is that you?!

438
00:23:08,387 --> 00:23:09,847
Yeah, it's me.

439
00:23:09,931 --> 00:23:11,182
Pretty great, right?

440
00:23:11,265 --> 00:23:13,392
- Whoa. - What's going on?
- What happened to you?

441
00:23:13,476 --> 00:23:14,685
Wait, where's Drac?

442
00:23:14,769 --> 00:23:15,812
Help!

443
00:23:17,647 --> 00:23:18,648
Drac?

444
00:23:18,731 --> 00:23:19,941
Hey, come on down here!

445
00:23:20,024 --> 00:23:21,275
Did you see Johnny?

446
00:23:21,359 --> 00:23:22,485
He's a monster!

447
00:23:22,568 --> 00:23:23,694
I know!

448
00:23:23,778 --> 00:23:25,822
I can't fly!

449
00:23:25,905 --> 00:23:28,449
Did he just say "Wow, that's a fly"?

450
00:23:28,533 --> 00:23:30,910
No, he definitely
said something about pie.

451
00:23:30,993 --> 00:23:32,954
Stop fooling around and come down here!

452
00:23:33,037 --> 00:23:34,789
I'm not fooling around!

453
00:23:34,872 --> 00:23:35,957
I...

454
00:23:40,294 --> 00:23:44,257
Uh, guys, he's not turning into a bat.

455
00:23:44,340 --> 00:23:45,883
Don't worry. I got him.

456
00:23:48,052 --> 00:23:49,720
- Whoa.
- Hey.

457
00:24:03,985 --> 00:24:04,986
Drac?

458
00:24:05,069 --> 00:24:06,821
Y-You-you look, uh, uh...

459
00:24:06,904 --> 00:24:08,573
You look terrible.

460
00:24:08,656 --> 00:24:10,533
Oh, no.

461
00:24:10,616 --> 00:24:11,659
Oh, no, no, no.

462
00:24:11,742 --> 00:24:13,286
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

463
00:24:13,369 --> 00:24:14,537
No!

464
00:24:14,620 --> 00:24:16,414
It can't be.

465
00:24:23,129 --> 00:24:25,298
Wow, look at us, Drac.

466
00:24:25,381 --> 00:24:28,134
You're human and I'm a monster.

467
00:24:28,217 --> 00:24:31,345
It's like Freaky Friday
but on a Tuesday, though.

468
00:24:34,473 --> 00:24:36,142
Where is it? Where is it?

469
00:24:36,225 --> 00:24:37,727
It's got to be here somewhere.

470
00:24:37,810 --> 00:24:39,562
What is going on, Drac?

471
00:24:39,645 --> 00:24:41,814
I need to find the ray!

472
00:24:41,898 --> 00:24:43,357
You mean that one right there?

473
00:24:43,441 --> 00:24:45,109
Ooh-hoo-hoo!

474
00:24:46,319 --> 00:24:48,112
Come on. Come on!

475
00:24:48,196 --> 00:24:49,906
Why isn't this working? Come on!

476
00:24:49,989 --> 00:24:51,741
I think it might be broken.

477
00:24:51,824 --> 00:24:53,284
No!

478
00:24:53,367 --> 00:24:54,410
It can't be.

479
00:24:54,493 --> 00:24:55,870
Hey, have you seen my dad?

480
00:24:57,288 --> 00:24:58,331
Come on, Johnny.

481
00:24:58,414 --> 00:24:59,540
We're getting out of here.

482
00:24:59,624 --> 00:25:00,833
What? No way.

483
00:25:00,917 --> 00:25:03,461
I got to tell Mavis
that her dream is back on.

484
00:25:03,544 --> 00:25:05,379
You know, now that I'm a monster and all.

485
00:25:05,463 --> 00:25:06,464
No, no, no, no, no, no.

486
00:25:06,547 --> 00:25:08,507
You will obey me.

487
00:25:08,591 --> 00:25:11,302
You will come with me!

488
00:25:13,679 --> 00:25:15,598
Hey, Mavis, I got great news!

489
00:25:19,060 --> 00:25:20,228
Johnny.

490
00:25:22,438 --> 00:25:23,564
Huh?

491
00:25:23,648 --> 00:25:25,191
Hey, Drac, what's wrong?

492
00:25:25,274 --> 00:25:27,485
Oh, it is the humanness!

493
00:25:28,778 --> 00:25:30,112
Drac! Oh, my gosh!

494
00:25:30,196 --> 00:25:31,447
Wh-What do we do?

495
00:25:31,530 --> 00:25:34,450
Quick, take me to Van Helsing!

496
00:25:35,868 --> 00:25:37,495
Oh, okay. I got you, Drac.

497
00:25:37,578 --> 00:25:39,914
Do not tell Mavis!

498
00:25:39,997 --> 00:25:41,624
Ooh! Ow-wee! The lab!

499
00:25:41,707 --> 00:25:46,128
Hurry! I can feel my insides melting away!

500
00:25:47,380 --> 00:25:49,882
Uh... wh-what just happened?

501
00:25:49,966 --> 00:25:50,967
Hey.

502
00:25:51,050 --> 00:25:51,968
Was that my dad?

503
00:25:52,051 --> 00:25:53,511
No. What? Uh, no.

504
00:25:53,594 --> 00:25:54,762
- Absolutely not.
- Nope.

505
00:25:54,845 --> 00:25:56,639
Are you doing
something different with your hair?

506
00:25:56,722 --> 00:25:59,350
Um, what is going on?

507
00:25:59,433 --> 00:26:00,977
What's going on?

508
00:26:01,060 --> 00:26:05,564
Um, Wayne here was about to
show off some new dance moves.

509
00:26:05,648 --> 00:26:07,525
- Dance moves?
- Yeah, go get 'em.

510
00:26:07,608 --> 00:26:08,609
- Whoa.
- Go get 'em.

511
00:26:08,693 --> 00:26:10,611
Uh, um...

512
00:26:14,782 --> 00:26:15,992
Yeah.

513
00:26:19,745 --> 00:26:20,871
Oh.

514
00:26:20,955 --> 00:26:22,832
Huh?

515
00:26:22,915 --> 00:26:24,041
Okay.

516
00:26:24,125 --> 00:26:25,918
Uh, well, if you see my dad,

517
00:26:26,002 --> 00:26:27,837
please tell him I need to talk to him.

518
00:26:30,423 --> 00:26:31,590
Oh, yeah.

519
00:26:32,758 --> 00:26:33,926
Watch me now. Yeah.

520
00:26:35,970 --> 00:26:37,346
Ow.

521
00:26:39,390 --> 00:26:40,975
Well, it's broken.

522
00:26:41,058 --> 00:26:43,894
The crystal's cracked,
and it's beyond repair.

523
00:26:43,978 --> 00:26:45,771
Wait, what?!

524
00:26:45,855 --> 00:26:47,398
Then get a new one!

525
00:26:47,481 --> 00:26:49,859
Whoa. Someone's feeling better.

526
00:26:49,942 --> 00:26:53,821
These crystals are very rare
and hard to come by.

527
00:26:53,904 --> 00:26:57,408
It took me three years to find that one.

528
00:26:57,491 --> 00:27:00,661
You see, I was a young
monster hunter at the time...

529
00:27:00,745 --> 00:27:02,788
well, not too young, but I felt young.

530
00:27:02,872 --> 00:27:04,957
Okay, don't need the whole story.

531
00:27:05,041 --> 00:27:08,711
Well, luckily for you,
I was brilliant enough to install

532
00:27:08,794 --> 00:27:13,299
a locator on the ray
for just this situation.

533
00:27:17,720 --> 00:27:19,096
There it is!

534
00:27:19,180 --> 00:27:21,432
- South America?!
- Oh, cool!

535
00:27:21,515 --> 00:27:24,852
I was there once spelunking
with some Norwegian wrestlers.

536
00:27:24,935 --> 00:27:27,396
We can just pop down there
and get a new one!

537
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:30,149
If it were but that simple, my friend.

538
00:27:30,232 --> 00:27:34,904
First, you must travel through
the treacherous jungle.

539
00:27:34,987 --> 00:27:37,490
Survival's doubtful.

540
00:27:37,573 --> 00:27:39,950
Then down a perilous river...

541
00:27:40,034 --> 00:27:40,993
Whoa.

542
00:27:41,077 --> 00:27:44,622
...until you reach
the Cave of the Reflexión!

543
00:27:46,415 --> 00:27:49,919
Where entering is deadly

544
00:27:50,002 --> 00:27:54,757
and escape impossible!

545
00:27:54,840 --> 00:27:56,425
It... it...

546
00:27:56,509 --> 00:28:00,388
it cost me my right back wheel.

547
00:28:01,889 --> 00:28:05,476
Uh, sorry for your loss?

548
00:28:07,853 --> 00:28:10,064
Well, happy hunting.

549
00:28:10,147 --> 00:28:13,067
This is a disaster!

550
00:28:13,150 --> 00:28:14,443
Don't worry, Drac.

551
00:28:14,527 --> 00:28:16,070
We'll get you back to your old self.

552
00:28:16,153 --> 00:28:17,822
But first, I better tell Mavis
we're going.

553
00:28:17,905 --> 00:28:19,657
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no!

554
00:28:19,740 --> 00:28:21,492
You can't tell Mavis!

555
00:28:21,575 --> 00:28:22,993
Why not?

556
00:28:23,077 --> 00:28:26,622
Uh, because, uh, you know, if you do,

557
00:28:26,705 --> 00:28:28,999
then, uh, then she will
want to come with us,

558
00:28:29,083 --> 00:28:31,961
and-and I was thinking that this could be

559
00:28:32,044 --> 00:28:35,214
a-a father-son, uh, bonding type of thing.

560
00:28:35,297 --> 00:28:36,382
Yes.

561
00:28:36,465 --> 00:28:39,301
You know, just the two of us?

562
00:28:39,385 --> 00:28:40,553
Really?

563
00:28:40,636 --> 00:28:42,430
- Awesome!
- Hold up, hold up.

564
00:28:42,513 --> 00:28:44,390
There'll be plenty of hugs on the trip.

565
00:28:44,473 --> 00:28:46,142
All right, time to go.

566
00:28:46,225 --> 00:28:47,726
Not a moment to waste!

567
00:28:49,603 --> 00:28:50,855
Right.

568
00:28:50,938 --> 00:28:53,023
Still human.

569
00:28:55,818 --> 00:28:58,237
I-I don't know.
It took me by surprise.

570
00:28:58,320 --> 00:28:59,989
It's, uh, kind of an improvement.

571
00:29:00,072 --> 00:29:02,658
Right? I think Johnny looks
way better as a monster.

572
00:29:02,741 --> 00:29:04,326
Yeah, there's a good-looking guy in there.

573
00:29:04,410 --> 00:29:06,787
Ooh, and the green
really brings out his eyes.

574
00:29:06,871 --> 00:29:08,456
Hey, it's Drac.

575
00:29:08,539 --> 00:29:12,209
"Going to find crystal to fix ray

576
00:29:12,293 --> 00:29:14,462
to turn us back to normal."

577
00:29:14,545 --> 00:29:16,046
"Don't tell Mavis"?

578
00:29:16,130 --> 00:29:18,007
Drac always does this.

579
00:29:18,090 --> 00:29:20,134
I hate getting caught
between him and Mavis.

580
00:29:20,217 --> 00:29:21,469
What should I write back?

581
00:29:21,552 --> 00:29:25,431
How about, "No, we're not
covering for you anymore"?

582
00:29:25,514 --> 00:29:26,891
Yeah, "Now that you're human,

583
00:29:26,974 --> 00:29:28,601
you can't do nothing about it."

584
00:29:28,684 --> 00:29:31,395
"Go do your own dirty work
for a change, buster."

585
00:29:31,479 --> 00:29:33,481
Okay, got it. Send.

586
00:29:33,564 --> 00:29:34,940
- What?! - What?!
- You actually sent that?!

587
00:29:35,024 --> 00:29:37,443
Oh, man, we're in trouble now.

588
00:29:37,526 --> 00:29:39,111
Nah, I just sent him a gif.

589
00:29:42,573 --> 00:29:44,575
Oh, hey, Blobby, check it out.

590
00:29:47,286 --> 00:29:48,496
That's a nice one, Blobby.

591
00:29:48,579 --> 00:29:49,955
Hey, here's to Blobby.

592
00:29:52,374 --> 00:29:54,960
No, Bl... No, Blobby.

593
00:29:55,044 --> 00:29:57,796
I just said, "Here's a toast
to a bunch of great guys."

594
00:29:57,880 --> 00:29:59,465
What does he think I said?

595
00:30:00,799 --> 00:30:02,009
Cheers!

596
00:30:11,435 --> 00:30:13,145
Huh? Whoa!

597
00:30:17,691 --> 00:30:21,612
Something is happening.

598
00:30:21,695 --> 00:30:23,447
Oh!

599
00:30:23,531 --> 00:30:25,449
Oh.

600
00:30:25,533 --> 00:30:27,368
Oh, no. No, nose, nose!

601
00:30:27,451 --> 00:30:29,370
Uh, wh... why?

602
00:30:29,453 --> 00:30:30,579
My stitches! Oh!

603
00:30:30,663 --> 00:30:32,665
What the...

604
00:30:32,748 --> 00:30:34,291
What's going on?

605
00:30:34,375 --> 00:30:36,418
Huh?

606
00:30:38,420 --> 00:30:39,421
What the...

607
00:30:41,757 --> 00:30:43,133
My fur!

608
00:30:44,301 --> 00:30:46,554
Oh, no, no. What's this, you guys?

609
00:30:46,637 --> 00:30:48,639
Oh, I'm balding?

610
00:30:48,722 --> 00:30:49,723
- What's happening?
- What the...

611
00:30:52,851 --> 00:30:54,770
Naked!

612
00:30:54,853 --> 00:30:56,647
Huh?

613
00:30:59,275 --> 00:31:00,401
Wow.

614
00:31:01,819 --> 00:31:04,029
What's up, fellas?

615
00:31:04,113 --> 00:31:06,240
- Ooh.
- Oh, he got the worst of it.

616
00:31:10,828 --> 00:31:13,205
Huh?

617
00:31:28,304 --> 00:31:30,055
Wow.

618
00:31:30,139 --> 00:31:32,182
Flying as a monster is so much better.

619
00:31:32,266 --> 00:31:33,267
Right, Drac?

620
00:31:36,604 --> 00:31:38,522
Feeling better?

621
00:31:38,606 --> 00:31:40,107
Nervous flier, huh?

622
00:31:42,026 --> 00:31:44,403
How is this plane even in the sky?!

623
00:31:44,486 --> 00:31:45,696
What is that sound?

624
00:31:45,779 --> 00:31:46,905
Do you smell burning?

625
00:31:46,989 --> 00:31:49,533
Is that duct tape
holding the wing together?!

626
00:31:54,246 --> 00:31:55,247
Okay, folks,

627
00:31:55,331 --> 00:31:57,416
we've reached our cruising altitude.

628
00:31:57,499 --> 00:31:59,251
We're not expecting any turbulence,

629
00:31:59,335 --> 00:32:03,380
so sit back, relax and enjoy the ride.

630
00:32:23,150 --> 00:32:24,943
Whoa, oh, oh.

631
00:32:26,111 --> 00:32:27,655
Uh, hey, Drac?

632
00:32:27,738 --> 00:32:29,740
I think you're turning back
into a monster.

633
00:32:29,823 --> 00:32:32,159
I got to get to the bathroom!

634
00:32:35,788 --> 00:32:38,207
Aw, are you feeling sick?

635
00:32:38,290 --> 00:32:39,917
Yes.

636
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:41,168
I just need to...

637
00:32:41,251 --> 00:32:43,379
Try spinning!

638
00:32:43,462 --> 00:32:45,756
Huh. Maybe some food
will settle your stomach.

639
00:32:47,383 --> 00:32:49,802
No? Or maybe some fresh air, then.

640
00:32:54,056 --> 00:32:55,516
He seems better.

641
00:32:55,599 --> 00:32:56,767
Yeah, thanks so much.

642
00:32:56,850 --> 00:32:58,894
It's my job.

643
00:33:01,897 --> 00:33:03,857
Dad?

644
00:33:03,941 --> 00:33:05,859
I really need to talk to you.

645
00:33:05,943 --> 00:33:08,404
Dad, are you in here?

646
00:33:09,488 --> 00:33:10,656
Dad?

647
00:33:10,739 --> 00:33:13,158
Where is he?

648
00:33:33,303 --> 00:33:35,806
"...to give the key to the hotel

649
00:33:35,889 --> 00:33:38,016
to my beloved daughter Mavis"?!

650
00:33:38,100 --> 00:33:39,476
I was right!

651
00:33:39,560 --> 00:33:42,104
Dad did want to give me the hotel.

652
00:33:42,187 --> 00:33:45,733
But then what made him change his mind?

653
00:33:52,448 --> 00:33:53,907
Oh, hey, sweetie.

654
00:33:53,991 --> 00:33:55,909
Have you seen Papa Drac or your father?

655
00:33:57,286 --> 00:33:59,580
That was not my father,

656
00:33:59,663 --> 00:34:02,124
just some random monster.

657
00:34:02,207 --> 00:34:05,294
Everything is normal.

658
00:34:06,420 --> 00:34:09,840
Okay, yep, something's
definitely going on.

659
00:34:15,512 --> 00:34:17,222
Whoa-ho-ho-ho-ho!

660
00:34:17,306 --> 00:34:18,807
So cool!

661
00:34:25,481 --> 00:34:28,025
Uh, are you sure
I can't help you with that?

662
00:34:28,108 --> 00:34:29,860
I said I got it.

663
00:34:29,943 --> 00:34:31,153
Huh?

664
00:34:33,489 --> 00:34:35,240
The sun!

665
00:34:39,328 --> 00:34:41,163
- Oh, no, the sun.
- Uh, Drac?

666
00:34:41,246 --> 00:34:43,290
The sun won't fry you now.

667
00:34:43,373 --> 00:34:44,583
You're human, remember?

668
00:34:44,666 --> 00:34:46,585
It's totally safe.

669
00:35:07,815 --> 00:35:11,235
The sun... it's...

670
00:35:11,318 --> 00:35:13,028
magnificent.

671
00:35:14,029 --> 00:35:17,491
I cannot believe that my whole life

672
00:35:17,574 --> 00:35:20,786
I have missed this elegant splendor.

673
00:35:20,869 --> 00:35:22,246
It's glorious.

674
00:35:22,329 --> 00:35:24,039
It's wondrous.

675
00:35:24,122 --> 00:35:25,833
It's... it's...

676
00:35:27,084 --> 00:35:29,378
It's burning my eyes!

677
00:35:31,338 --> 00:35:33,340
I'm blind!

678
00:35:36,844 --> 00:35:38,262
Drac!

679
00:35:41,890 --> 00:35:43,642
I can't see anything.

680
00:35:43,725 --> 00:35:44,893
Whoopsie.

681
00:35:44,977 --> 00:35:46,103
Is anyone there?

682
00:35:46,186 --> 00:35:47,604
Ooh! Hello?

683
00:35:47,688 --> 00:35:48,814
Johnny?

684
00:35:48,897 --> 00:35:49,940
Whoa.

685
00:35:51,275 --> 00:35:52,276
Huh?

686
00:35:54,653 --> 00:35:56,154
Whoop. I got ya.

687
00:35:56,238 --> 00:35:57,281
Pardon me!

688
00:35:59,950 --> 00:36:01,451
Excuse me. Oops.

689
00:36:01,535 --> 00:36:02,578
Coming through.

690
00:36:03,745 --> 00:36:04,913
There you go.

691
00:36:04,997 --> 00:36:06,707
Okay, you stay here.

692
00:36:06,790 --> 00:36:08,458
I'll go get us a taxi.

693
00:36:08,542 --> 00:36:09,835
Taxi!

694
00:36:20,012 --> 00:36:21,263
Sorry!

695
00:36:21,346 --> 00:36:23,891
Huh, that was weird.

696
00:36:25,267 --> 00:36:27,019
I wonder what that was all about.

697
00:36:47,789 --> 00:36:49,207
Huh?

698
00:36:52,461 --> 00:36:53,629
Gigi?

699
00:37:00,636 --> 00:37:02,554
Gigi!

700
00:37:05,390 --> 00:37:07,225
Oops.

701
00:37:25,077 --> 00:37:26,745
I swear...

702
00:37:26,828 --> 00:37:28,288
you've gotten bigger.

703
00:37:28,372 --> 00:37:30,248
Come on, Drac, join in!

704
00:37:31,625 --> 00:37:33,210
Huh?

705
00:37:33,293 --> 00:37:35,879
Why are we going so slowly?

706
00:37:39,132 --> 00:37:40,300
Johnny?

707
00:37:40,384 --> 00:37:41,385
Huh?

708
00:37:41,468 --> 00:37:43,345
Your monsterness is weighing us down.

709
00:37:43,428 --> 00:37:45,597
- We're getting nowhere.
- Really?

710
00:37:46,682 --> 00:37:48,976
Whoa.

711
00:37:49,059 --> 00:37:50,143
Don't worry, Drac.

712
00:37:50,227 --> 00:37:52,229
I've got an idea.

713
00:37:55,774 --> 00:37:56,858
Wait a second!

714
00:38:08,495 --> 00:38:11,039
♪ Yeah, yeah, yeah. ♪

715
00:38:22,217 --> 00:38:24,386
Ooh.

716
00:38:27,514 --> 00:38:29,516
All right, guys, coast is clear.

717
00:38:37,107 --> 00:38:39,651
Have you seriously been naked
this whole time?

718
00:38:39,735 --> 00:38:41,069
Uh, yeah.

719
00:38:41,153 --> 00:38:43,030
Why would only my glasses be visible?

720
00:38:44,114 --> 00:38:46,074
I-I don't get it. Why are we hiding?

721
00:38:46,158 --> 00:38:48,952
'Cause if Mavis sees us,
she's gonna know something's up.

722
00:38:49,036 --> 00:38:51,872
Look, Drac said he and Johnny
will be back with a cure.

723
00:38:51,955 --> 00:38:53,665
We just need to lay low until then.

724
00:38:59,838 --> 00:39:01,548
- Have you seen my dad?
- Have you seen your dad?

725
00:39:01,631 --> 00:39:02,966
Huh?

726
00:39:03,050 --> 00:39:05,218
No, I haven't seen him since the party.

727
00:39:05,302 --> 00:39:08,055
Oh, hey, has anyone seen Wayne?

728
00:39:08,138 --> 00:39:09,890
- Where is Frank?
- Shh!

729
00:39:09,973 --> 00:39:12,017
He's been missing since the party.

730
00:39:12,100 --> 00:39:14,019
Well, I haven't seen Frank or Wayne.

731
00:39:14,102 --> 00:39:15,228
Yeah, has anybody seen 'em?

732
00:39:15,312 --> 00:39:16,688
I hope they're not up to something.

733
00:39:16,772 --> 00:39:18,231
I saw them on the dance floor...

734
00:39:18,315 --> 00:39:20,901
Oops, almost forgot good old Blobby.

735
00:39:24,029 --> 00:39:25,781
Frank?

736
00:39:25,864 --> 00:39:27,407
Oh. Uh, hey, babe.

737
00:39:27,491 --> 00:39:28,742
What's up?

738
00:39:28,825 --> 00:39:30,702
♪ Sexy man. ♪

739
00:39:34,539 --> 00:39:37,375
Frank, what did you do?!

740
00:39:37,459 --> 00:39:39,544
And who are those guys?

741
00:39:39,628 --> 00:39:41,713
Mavis, it's me, Uncle Griffin.

742
00:39:41,797 --> 00:39:42,923
You don't recognize me?

743
00:39:43,006 --> 00:39:44,174
Uh, no.

744
00:39:44,257 --> 00:39:46,593
I've literally never seen you before.

745
00:39:46,676 --> 00:39:48,804
Um, Murray?

746
00:39:48,887 --> 00:39:51,932
In the 5,000-year-old flesh.

747
00:39:52,015 --> 00:39:53,517
Oh, look at that. Well, that's fun.

748
00:39:56,186 --> 00:39:57,604
I'm awake!

749
00:39:57,687 --> 00:39:59,981
Wayne? Is that you?

750
00:40:02,984 --> 00:40:04,444
Hey, where's Dad?

751
00:40:04,528 --> 00:40:06,947
Um... your dad?

752
00:40:07,030 --> 00:40:08,824
Uh, I don't know where your dad is.

753
00:40:08,907 --> 00:40:10,075
I just got here.

754
00:40:10,158 --> 00:40:12,119
I'm W-Walter.

755
00:40:12,202 --> 00:40:13,411
Mom!

756
00:40:13,495 --> 00:40:15,163
This is not funny, Wayne.

757
00:40:15,247 --> 00:40:16,248
I'm not laughing.

758
00:40:16,331 --> 00:40:18,959
I leave you alone for five minutes,

759
00:40:19,042 --> 00:40:20,460
and you become a human?!

760
00:40:20,544 --> 00:40:22,129
- Hey, chill.
- Cut it out.

761
00:40:22,212 --> 00:40:23,588
Blobby's not dessert, okay?

762
00:40:23,672 --> 00:40:26,007
Mavis, what is going on?

763
00:40:26,091 --> 00:40:27,425
This just in.

764
00:40:27,509 --> 00:40:29,636
Breaking news from our international desk.

765
00:40:29,719 --> 00:40:30,929
Dad?

766
00:40:31,012 --> 00:40:33,181
This was the scene
outside the local airport,

767
00:40:33,265 --> 00:40:37,519
where an unidentified monster
saved a confused man

768
00:40:37,602 --> 00:40:39,604
- dressed up in a Halloween costume.
- I got ya.

769
00:40:39,688 --> 00:40:41,356
Wait, that looks kind of like...

770
00:40:43,066 --> 00:40:44,359
Johnny?!

771
00:40:44,442 --> 00:40:45,819
Oh, yeah, yeah.

772
00:40:45,902 --> 00:40:48,780
Your dad's a human now,
and Johnny's a monster.

773
00:40:48,864 --> 00:40:50,323
Oh, no.

774
00:40:50,407 --> 00:40:52,617
I was not supposed to say that out loud.

775
00:41:01,585 --> 00:41:02,961
Hey, thanks for the lift.

776
00:41:07,883 --> 00:41:09,926
Huh?

777
00:41:13,221 --> 00:41:15,140
Johnny. Johnny, hurry up.

778
00:41:18,852 --> 00:41:20,020
Ah.

779
00:41:20,103 --> 00:41:21,730
Adios, everybody.

780
00:41:21,813 --> 00:41:22,814
Come on!

781
00:41:22,898 --> 00:41:24,524
We don't have time for chitchat.

782
00:41:24,608 --> 00:41:27,777
We've got to get through this jungle
if we're going to find the crystal.

783
00:41:37,662 --> 00:41:41,124
Johnny, we are getting nowhere.

784
00:41:44,836 --> 00:41:46,087
Don't worry, Drac.

785
00:41:46,171 --> 00:41:47,297
I got you covered.

786
00:41:47,380 --> 00:41:49,424
Huh?

787
00:41:51,927 --> 00:41:54,304
And the final touch.

788
00:41:54,387 --> 00:41:57,224
Now you're ready for the great outdoors.

789
00:41:59,059 --> 00:42:00,435
Fine. Okay. Whatever.

790
00:42:00,518 --> 00:42:02,646
- Can we please just get going?
- Hold up, Drac.

791
00:42:02,729 --> 00:42:05,023
- Whoa!
- You forgot your trunk.

792
00:42:05,106 --> 00:42:08,026
Okay, let's find that crystal.

793
00:42:12,906 --> 00:42:16,034
Come on, Drac. You're gonna love hiking!

794
00:42:33,343 --> 00:42:35,512
Aren't the sounds of nature soothing?

795
00:42:43,311 --> 00:42:45,855
Ugh. What is that smell?

796
00:42:47,023 --> 00:42:48,984
Oh. What is that?

797
00:42:50,151 --> 00:42:51,403
Oh!

798
00:42:51,486 --> 00:42:53,154
It's me!

799
00:42:53,238 --> 00:42:55,490
Drac, chill. You just need a shower.

800
00:42:55,573 --> 00:42:58,868
And where am I going to find a shower
in the middle of the jungle?

801
00:43:08,420 --> 00:43:10,088
Huh?

802
00:43:11,881 --> 00:43:14,092
Whoa.

803
00:43:18,596 --> 00:43:19,764
Hmm.

804
00:43:30,817 --> 00:43:33,028
Hey, I think you might have
a pollen allergy.

805
00:43:33,111 --> 00:43:34,696
Nonsense. I...

806
00:43:48,585 --> 00:43:50,211
Johnny!

807
00:44:17,739 --> 00:44:21,117
How am I so wet

808
00:44:21,201 --> 00:44:24,454
and yet completely dry?

809
00:44:27,707 --> 00:44:30,085
How much further?

810
00:44:31,961 --> 00:44:33,463
Huh?

811
00:44:33,546 --> 00:44:34,714
No, no, no.

812
00:44:34,798 --> 00:44:36,466
No, no, no, no, no!

813
00:44:38,760 --> 00:44:41,888
We are never going to get there.

814
00:44:43,431 --> 00:44:46,017
Whoa, Drac.

815
00:44:46,101 --> 00:44:48,228
Isn't that something?

816
00:44:48,311 --> 00:44:50,522
Water. Thank you.

817
00:44:50,605 --> 00:44:52,190
I am melting.

818
00:44:52,273 --> 00:44:54,776
Whoa, whoa, whoa! Hold on, Drac.

819
00:44:54,859 --> 00:44:57,779
You got to be extra careful
with strange bodies of water.

820
00:44:57,862 --> 00:44:59,781
This one time, my friend Katmatchka and I

821
00:44:59,864 --> 00:45:02,075
were backpacking in Thailand...

822
00:45:02,158 --> 00:45:03,159
Drac?

823
00:45:03,243 --> 00:45:07,497
Wahoo...!

824
00:45:19,509 --> 00:45:22,137
Well, look on the bright side.

825
00:45:22,220 --> 00:45:24,347
At least you're not hot anymore.

826
00:45:34,774 --> 00:45:36,443
Ugh, I can't get through to them.

827
00:45:36,526 --> 00:45:38,319
I'm not having any luck either.

828
00:45:38,403 --> 00:45:40,238
I don't understand.

829
00:45:40,321 --> 00:45:42,198
What are they doing in South America?

830
00:45:42,282 --> 00:45:44,951
And how did they change themselves
in the first place?

831
00:45:45,034 --> 00:45:47,454
Exactly. It's not like
there's a mad scientist

832
00:45:47,537 --> 00:45:49,914
just living in the basement.

833
00:45:49,998 --> 00:45:51,124
Oh.

834
00:45:52,250 --> 00:45:55,962
Great-Grandfather, what did you... do?

835
00:46:00,508 --> 00:46:01,759
Oh, no.

836
00:46:01,843 --> 00:46:03,970
Great-Grandfather?

837
00:46:05,513 --> 00:46:07,474
Oh. Hello, ladies.

838
00:46:07,557 --> 00:46:09,184
A little busy at the moment.

839
00:46:09,267 --> 00:46:11,269
What did you do to Johnny and my dad?!

840
00:46:11,352 --> 00:46:12,479
Shh.

841
00:46:12,562 --> 00:46:13,938
Lower your voice.

842
00:46:17,150 --> 00:46:19,986
Is that... Gigi?

843
00:46:21,488 --> 00:46:25,450
Turns out the ray is highly unstable.

844
00:46:30,747 --> 00:46:33,166
The transformation keeps mutating

845
00:46:33,249 --> 00:46:35,960
and won't stop until the subject becomes

846
00:46:36,044 --> 00:46:38,755
a mindless, ravenous beast!

847
00:46:39,964 --> 00:46:41,299
Keeps mutating?

848
00:46:41,382 --> 00:46:43,176
Whoa!

849
00:46:43,259 --> 00:46:44,802
Oh, no. Johnny!

850
00:46:50,975 --> 00:46:51,976
Ericka!

851
00:46:52,060 --> 00:46:54,437
Got it.

852
00:46:54,521 --> 00:46:55,980
Hey! Gigi!

853
00:46:57,440 --> 00:46:58,691
Over here!

854
00:47:06,407 --> 00:47:08,826
We've got to find my dad and Johnny

855
00:47:08,910 --> 00:47:10,495
before it's too late!

856
00:47:21,589 --> 00:47:22,840
Ah, man.

857
00:47:22,924 --> 00:47:26,052
Why didn't anyone tell me
that claws are so awesome?

858
00:47:32,350 --> 00:47:33,810
Whoa.

859
00:47:33,893 --> 00:47:36,521
Being a monster is super weird.

860
00:47:36,604 --> 00:47:38,648
Yeah.

861
00:47:38,731 --> 00:47:41,484
But being a human is the worst.

862
00:47:41,568 --> 00:47:43,945
Ah, come on. I wouldn't say that.

863
00:47:44,028 --> 00:47:45,321
Really?

864
00:47:45,405 --> 00:47:48,741
Blisters, sunburn and swamp butt
aren't the worst?

865
00:47:48,825 --> 00:47:50,410
What was that?

866
00:47:52,745 --> 00:47:54,038
Mosquito!

867
00:47:54,122 --> 00:47:55,415
Vampires of the jungle.

868
00:47:55,498 --> 00:47:57,166
Hey, I resent that.

869
00:47:57,250 --> 00:47:58,251
Yow!

870
00:48:02,547 --> 00:48:04,382
They're everywhere! Yi!

871
00:48:04,465 --> 00:48:06,217
Johnny, they're all over you!

872
00:48:06,301 --> 00:48:07,802
What?

873
00:48:10,179 --> 00:48:11,723
Monster skin.

874
00:48:11,806 --> 00:48:13,099
Don't worry, Drac.

875
00:48:13,182 --> 00:48:14,601
They can't bite me.

876
00:48:27,238 --> 00:48:29,907
- Wha...?
- Hold still, Drac! I got him!

877
00:48:29,991 --> 00:48:31,909
Johnny, wait!

878
00:48:50,386 --> 00:48:51,429
Whoa.

879
00:48:51,512 --> 00:48:52,722
- That is so cool!
- Yeah.

880
00:48:52,805 --> 00:48:54,057
Ooh.

881
00:48:55,683 --> 00:48:58,019
- Ooh.
- Whoa! Careful.

882
00:48:58,102 --> 00:48:59,729
Yeah!

883
00:48:59,812 --> 00:49:01,856
Wahoo!

884
00:49:07,070 --> 00:49:08,863
Here, try this.

885
00:49:11,949 --> 00:49:13,076
Seriously?

886
00:49:13,159 --> 00:49:15,662
I look ridiculous.

887
00:49:15,745 --> 00:49:16,996
Keep your shirt on, pal.

888
00:49:17,080 --> 00:49:19,540
We've seen more than enough of you.

889
00:49:19,624 --> 00:49:21,209
Me, on the other hand...

890
00:49:21,292 --> 00:49:24,087
easy on the eyes.

891
00:49:24,170 --> 00:49:26,422
- Ugh, please.
- Coming through!

892
00:49:26,506 --> 00:49:27,840
Wendell, get down from there.

893
00:49:27,924 --> 00:49:29,425
Wally, sweetie, uh-uh, don't touch that.

894
00:49:29,509 --> 00:49:31,386
Wendy, no. Put that down.

895
00:49:31,469 --> 00:49:34,138
Ow. Wesley, what did I just... Huh?

896
00:49:34,222 --> 00:49:35,348
Oops.

897
00:49:36,933 --> 00:49:38,059
My bad.

898
00:49:38,142 --> 00:49:39,268
Whoa!

899
00:49:39,352 --> 00:49:40,478
Hey!

900
00:49:40,561 --> 00:49:41,771
Do not make me come back there!

901
00:49:41,854 --> 00:49:43,564
I will turn this blimp around!

902
00:49:43,648 --> 00:49:45,108
Sorry, Ericka.

903
00:49:45,191 --> 00:49:48,486
Sorry, I didn't think leaving them
at a monster hotel would be safe.

904
00:49:48,569 --> 00:49:52,073
Guess I didn't realize
your blimp would be such a, uh...

905
00:49:52,156 --> 00:49:53,491
A monster-killing machine?

906
00:49:53,574 --> 00:49:55,576
What? No.

907
00:49:55,660 --> 00:49:57,620
Whoa!

908
00:49:58,788 --> 00:50:00,665
Okay. Yeah, it's a death trap.

909
00:50:00,748 --> 00:50:03,960
Yeah. Sorry about that.

910
00:50:04,043 --> 00:50:06,963
All this... this is the old me.

911
00:50:07,046 --> 00:50:09,757
Your dad helped me leave that all behind.

912
00:50:11,008 --> 00:50:13,386
I hope he's okay.

913
00:50:13,469 --> 00:50:15,722
Don't worry. We're gonna find them.

914
00:50:40,496 --> 00:50:42,582
Okay, guys, we've made it.

915
00:50:42,665 --> 00:50:43,833
Whoa!

916
00:50:43,916 --> 00:50:45,668
It's enormous.

917
00:50:45,752 --> 00:50:47,920
How we gonna find them in there?

918
00:50:49,338 --> 00:50:51,507
I think I have an idea.

919
00:50:54,635 --> 00:50:57,054
Well, we're gonna have to take
this search to the ground.

920
00:50:57,138 --> 00:50:59,223
I have just the thing.

921
00:51:15,490 --> 00:51:17,241
Oh, my hair!

922
00:51:17,325 --> 00:51:19,410
Oh, my hair.

923
00:51:20,661 --> 00:51:22,079
Where's Blobby?!

924
00:51:23,414 --> 00:51:25,249
Okay, Mavis, what's the plan?

925
00:51:31,964 --> 00:51:33,341
♪ Just the two of us ♪

926
00:51:33,424 --> 00:51:36,219
♪ Father and son-in-law. ♪

927
00:51:36,302 --> 00:51:37,512
Got 'em.

928
00:51:37,595 --> 00:51:38,763
That way!

929
00:51:59,408 --> 00:52:02,370
Oh! My head!

930
00:52:02,453 --> 00:52:05,248
What? What's going on?

931
00:52:05,331 --> 00:52:06,666
Have a good nap?

932
00:52:06,749 --> 00:52:10,086
Nap? You slapped me so hard
I lost consciousness!

933
00:52:10,169 --> 00:52:12,255
But I did get that mosquito.

934
00:52:12,338 --> 00:52:14,674
Hey, where are we?

935
00:52:14,757 --> 00:52:16,217
Just following the ping.

936
00:52:16,300 --> 00:52:17,343
Let me see that.

937
00:52:19,011 --> 00:52:20,596
Okay.

938
00:52:20,680 --> 00:52:22,890
It seems like we're going
in the right direction.

939
00:52:22,974 --> 00:52:24,475
Huh?

940
00:52:24,559 --> 00:52:26,435
Wh-What's going on?

941
00:52:26,519 --> 00:52:28,396
Oh, what's wrong with this thing?

942
00:52:28,479 --> 00:52:30,314
We lost the signal.

943
00:52:30,398 --> 00:52:32,483
- Why would it just...
- Whoops!

944
00:52:32,567 --> 00:52:34,485
Whoa.

945
00:52:37,738 --> 00:52:40,658
Huh. I think we took a wrong turn.

946
00:52:41,826 --> 00:52:43,411
You took a wrong turn!

947
00:52:43,494 --> 00:52:45,329
I can't trust you to do anything right!

948
00:52:45,413 --> 00:52:47,707
Now put me down!

949
00:52:47,790 --> 00:52:49,500
- No, Drac. Hey. Hey.
- Get your claws off me!

950
00:52:49,584 --> 00:52:50,877
We're really high up. Whoa.

951
00:52:50,960 --> 00:52:52,044
- Whoa, whoa, whoa! Hey!
- Put me down! Put me down!

952
00:52:52,128 --> 00:52:53,129
- Whoa, whoa, whoa!
- Put me...

953
00:52:53,212 --> 00:52:54,797
Drac!

954
00:53:09,604 --> 00:53:10,897
Ow, ow, ee!

955
00:53:10,980 --> 00:53:12,982
- Johnny, your tail!
- Ah, sorry!

956
00:53:13,065 --> 00:53:14,442
Your foot!

957
00:53:16,819 --> 00:53:18,404
Your wings, Johnny!

958
00:53:18,487 --> 00:53:19,488
Wings?

959
00:53:19,572 --> 00:53:21,365
Johnny! You've got wings!

960
00:53:21,449 --> 00:53:22,992
Flap, Johnny, flap!

961
00:53:24,702 --> 00:53:26,412
- Fly!
- I can't! I can't!

962
00:53:26,495 --> 00:53:27,955
Drac, what do we do?!

963
00:53:28,039 --> 00:53:29,874
- Drac!
- Johnny, Johnny, calm down!

964
00:53:29,957 --> 00:53:33,044
- Can you wiggle your nose?
- Uh-huh.

965
00:53:33,127 --> 00:53:35,755
- Wiggle your toes.
- Okay.

966
00:53:35,838 --> 00:53:37,715
Flap your wings!

967
00:53:39,216 --> 00:53:40,885
I... I-I can't.

968
00:53:40,968 --> 00:53:42,136
I can't do it.

969
00:53:42,219 --> 00:53:44,472
You're doing it, Johnny!

970
00:53:44,555 --> 00:53:47,558
You're flying!

971
00:53:47,642 --> 00:53:50,269
What? I'm-I'm flying?

972
00:53:50,353 --> 00:53:52,271
I'm flying!

973
00:53:53,731 --> 00:53:55,816
I did it, Drac!

974
00:53:55,900 --> 00:53:56,901
Drac?

975
00:54:07,828 --> 00:54:09,497
Johnny!

976
00:54:09,580 --> 00:54:11,415
You-you did it.

977
00:54:11,499 --> 00:54:12,875
You're flying!

978
00:54:12,959 --> 00:54:13,960
Yeah.

979
00:54:14,043 --> 00:54:16,337
I'm really getting the hang of this!

980
00:54:18,881 --> 00:54:21,717
- Wow!
- This is amazing!

981
00:54:31,811 --> 00:54:33,688
Yeah!

982
00:54:35,648 --> 00:54:37,316
Flap, Johnny, flap.

983
00:54:37,400 --> 00:54:39,485
Right, right. Flapping. I'm flapping.

984
00:54:52,832 --> 00:54:55,334
Wha... Whoa!

985
00:54:55,418 --> 00:54:57,545
- Whoa!
- Johnny, sit down.

986
00:54:57,628 --> 00:54:59,797
You're going to put out the fire.

987
00:54:59,880 --> 00:55:02,675
Ah, man. Boy, that was fun.

988
00:55:02,758 --> 00:55:05,928
Right. Getting lost
and almost falling to your death

989
00:55:06,012 --> 00:55:07,430
is super fun.

990
00:55:07,513 --> 00:55:10,016
Okay, Mr. Cranky Fangs.

991
00:55:10,099 --> 00:55:11,225
Whatever you say.

992
00:55:11,308 --> 00:55:12,768
What are you talking about?

993
00:55:15,062 --> 00:55:16,939
Ah, no, it's ruined.

994
00:55:17,023 --> 00:55:19,066
See? That.

995
00:55:19,150 --> 00:55:20,943
That's what I'm talking about.

996
00:55:21,027 --> 00:55:24,822
If you only see the worst in things,
you'll miss the best part.

997
00:55:24,905 --> 00:55:26,157
Here, look, look, look, look.

998
00:55:26,240 --> 00:55:28,701
At first, a tasty marshmallow.

999
00:55:28,784 --> 00:55:29,785
Then...

1000
00:55:31,245 --> 00:55:32,788
Oh, no! It's on fire and ruined!

1001
00:55:32,872 --> 00:55:35,124
But blow out the fire...

1002
00:55:35,207 --> 00:55:37,209
and crack open the burnt stuff,

1003
00:55:37,293 --> 00:55:39,795
you'll find something
sweet and gooey inside.

1004
00:55:42,590 --> 00:55:44,550
You just have to look for it.

1005
00:55:51,223 --> 00:55:53,350
Mmm.

1006
00:55:53,434 --> 00:55:55,019
Gooeylicious!

1007
00:55:59,190 --> 00:56:03,652
I guess it's always been hard for me
to see the positive side of things.

1008
00:56:03,736 --> 00:56:07,531
You know, raising a daughter
on your own for so long,

1009
00:56:07,615 --> 00:56:09,533
you're constantly worried.

1010
00:56:09,617 --> 00:56:11,702
Always fearing the worst.

1011
00:56:11,786 --> 00:56:14,371
That's why I built the hotel.

1012
00:56:14,455 --> 00:56:15,581
To protect her.

1013
00:56:15,664 --> 00:56:18,375
To protect all of us.

1014
00:56:18,459 --> 00:56:19,627
It's...

1015
00:56:20,711 --> 00:56:22,713
It's part of our family.

1016
00:56:23,964 --> 00:56:25,633
Sorry.

1017
00:56:25,716 --> 00:56:27,885
Maybe... maybe it's this new me,

1018
00:56:27,968 --> 00:56:31,847
but I'm feeling a bit overwhelmed.

1019
00:56:31,931 --> 00:56:33,974
No, Drac, it's okay.

1020
00:56:34,058 --> 00:56:35,226
I totally get it.

1021
00:56:35,309 --> 00:56:37,770
The hotel... it's something really special.

1022
00:56:37,853 --> 00:56:41,565
And the fact that you would trust me
with something so important,

1023
00:56:41,649 --> 00:56:44,401
I just can't tell you
how much that means to me.

1024
00:56:49,532 --> 00:56:52,576
I... I need to tell you something.

1025
00:56:52,660 --> 00:56:54,245
What is it, Drac?

1026
00:56:54,328 --> 00:56:57,206
Johnny, the truth is

1027
00:56:57,289 --> 00:56:59,625
that there is no monster real...

1028
00:57:04,171 --> 00:57:05,589
Johnny!

1029
00:57:05,673 --> 00:57:07,007
Mavis?

1030
00:57:07,091 --> 00:57:08,926
It's you!

1031
00:57:09,009 --> 00:57:10,886
It is still you in there, isn't it?

1032
00:57:10,970 --> 00:57:12,680
Of course it is.

1033
00:57:12,763 --> 00:57:14,056
Hey, hot stuff.

1034
00:57:16,142 --> 00:57:18,269
Ericka!

1035
00:57:18,352 --> 00:57:20,146
Don't sweat it.

1036
00:57:20,229 --> 00:57:22,857
I love you inside and out.

1037
00:57:23,899 --> 00:57:24,942
Whew!

1038
00:57:25,025 --> 00:57:26,193
Ericka, what's going on?

1039
00:57:26,277 --> 00:57:27,987
I-I mean, what are you doing here?

1040
00:57:28,070 --> 00:57:29,280
She's not the only one.

1041
00:57:29,363 --> 00:57:31,282
Hey, hey, buddy.

1042
00:57:31,365 --> 00:57:33,033
Guys? You...

1043
00:57:33,117 --> 00:57:35,369
- I-I mean, you're...
- Human?

1044
00:57:35,452 --> 00:57:37,371
Yeah, we noticed.

1045
00:57:37,454 --> 00:57:39,790
Though in my case,
it's a huge improvement.

1046
00:57:39,874 --> 00:57:41,584
Can we move on?

1047
00:57:41,667 --> 00:57:44,545
I don't understand.
I mean, how did this happen?

1048
00:57:44,628 --> 00:57:45,963
That's what I'd like to know.

1049
00:57:46,046 --> 00:57:49,633
Johnny, why did you
turn yourself into a monster?

1050
00:57:49,717 --> 00:57:51,760
So we can keep the hotel in the family.

1051
00:57:51,844 --> 00:57:54,388
You know, 'cause of
the monster real estate law.

1052
00:57:54,471 --> 00:57:56,849
Monster real estate law?

1053
00:57:56,932 --> 00:57:58,058
I don't understand.

1054
00:57:58,142 --> 00:58:00,102
No, neither do I.

1055
00:58:00,186 --> 00:58:01,937
Okay, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

1056
00:58:02,021 --> 00:58:03,814
I-I can explain.

1057
00:58:03,898 --> 00:58:06,901
It, uh, it all happened so fast.

1058
00:58:06,984 --> 00:58:11,280
You see, Johnny found out
that I was giving you guys the hotel.

1059
00:58:11,363 --> 00:58:14,366
But then he, you know,
had a Johnny takeover:

1060
00:58:14,450 --> 00:58:17,536
escalators, name changes,
blah, blah, blah.

1061
00:58:17,620 --> 00:58:20,331
And so I... well, you know.

1062
00:58:21,540 --> 00:58:23,417
I-I... I...

1063
00:58:23,500 --> 00:58:25,544
I...

1064
00:58:25,628 --> 00:58:27,004
I panicked!

1065
00:58:27,087 --> 00:58:28,589
And lied?

1066
00:58:28,672 --> 00:58:30,257
Wait.

1067
00:58:30,341 --> 00:58:33,302
There's no monster real estate law?

1068
00:58:33,385 --> 00:58:36,138
Well, then... then that means that this...

1069
00:58:36,222 --> 00:58:38,265
this was all a lie?

1070
00:58:38,349 --> 00:58:41,268
You didn't want to have
any bonding time with me.

1071
00:58:41,352 --> 00:58:43,354
You just didn't want to give me the hotel!

1072
00:58:43,437 --> 00:58:45,856
No. I-I mean, yes, but...

1073
00:58:45,940 --> 00:58:47,608
You hate me!

1074
00:58:47,691 --> 00:58:49,318
Johnny, no.

1075
00:58:49,401 --> 00:58:51,904
- I-I didn't mean...
- Dad, how could you?

1076
00:58:51,987 --> 00:58:53,280
After everything.

1077
00:58:53,364 --> 00:58:54,990
It's easy!

1078
00:58:56,367 --> 00:58:58,744
'Cause I...

1079
00:58:58,827 --> 00:59:02,539
not part of family!

1080
00:59:02,623 --> 00:59:06,085
Johnny, something is happening to you.

1081
00:59:07,670 --> 00:59:09,421
Johnny out of here!

1082
00:59:09,505 --> 00:59:11,340
Johnny, wait!

1083
00:59:12,633 --> 00:59:14,260
This is all your fault!

1084
00:59:14,343 --> 00:59:16,011
All Johnny wanted was to feel like

1085
00:59:16,095 --> 00:59:19,932
he was part of this family,
but you could never accept him.

1086
00:59:20,015 --> 00:59:22,643
All you care about is your stupid hotel!

1087
00:59:22,726 --> 00:59:23,852
Mavis, I was going to...

1088
00:59:23,936 --> 00:59:27,273
And now, because of you,
I might lose him forever.

1089
00:59:27,356 --> 00:59:28,565
Mavis, wait!

1090
00:59:29,650 --> 00:59:31,986
Ericka, let me know
when you find the crystal.

1091
00:59:32,069 --> 00:59:34,363
I have to find Johnny
before it's too late.

1092
00:59:35,364 --> 00:59:37,741
"Too late"? What does that mean?

1093
00:59:37,825 --> 00:59:39,785
Come on. I'll fill you in on the way.

1094
00:59:44,373 --> 00:59:46,500
Johnny's going to keep transforming?!

1095
00:59:46,583 --> 00:59:49,086
Until he becomes a mindless beast.

1096
00:59:49,169 --> 00:59:51,046
There won't be any Johnny left.

1097
00:59:51,130 --> 00:59:54,591
That's why we need to find
the crystal. Now!

1098
00:59:56,135 --> 00:59:57,469
That way!

1099
00:59:57,553 --> 00:59:58,887
Follow the river!

1100
00:59:58,971 --> 01:00:00,973
Whoa!

1101
01:00:07,688 --> 01:00:08,772
Uh, Drac?

1102
01:00:08,856 --> 01:00:10,441
Straight. Keep going straight.

1103
01:00:10,524 --> 01:00:12,401
Okay. Straight it is.

1104
01:00:13,861 --> 01:00:15,779
Wait, wait, wait. What are you doing?!

1105
01:00:26,832 --> 01:00:29,918
Well, aren't you just full of surprises?

1106
01:00:31,503 --> 01:00:32,671
That way!

1107
01:00:34,757 --> 01:00:36,175
Johnny?

1108
01:00:36,258 --> 01:00:38,093
Johnny, where are you?

1109
01:00:38,177 --> 01:00:39,636
Johnny?

1110
01:00:46,643 --> 01:00:48,562
Oh, no.

1111
01:01:00,491 --> 01:01:02,701
Oh, Johnny.

1112
01:01:05,245 --> 01:01:07,539
Johnny! Johnny, stop!

1113
01:01:07,623 --> 01:01:08,707
Huh?

1114
01:01:08,791 --> 01:01:09,917
Oh.

1115
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:11,835
M... M-M...

1116
01:01:11,919 --> 01:01:13,420
Mavis?

1117
01:01:13,504 --> 01:01:15,255
Yes, honey, it's me.

1118
01:01:15,339 --> 01:01:16,382
Oh, thank goodness.

1119
01:01:16,465 --> 01:01:17,841
I thought I lost you.

1120
01:01:17,925 --> 01:01:20,636
- Mavis!
- I'm so sorry.

1121
01:01:20,719 --> 01:01:22,596
My dad never should've lied to you.

1122
01:01:24,348 --> 01:01:27,059
Dracula bad!

1123
01:01:27,142 --> 01:01:28,811
Whoa! Johnny!

1124
01:01:35,734 --> 01:01:38,237
Whoa.

1125
01:01:56,713 --> 01:01:58,006
That's it.

1126
01:01:58,090 --> 01:02:00,509
The crystal is in there.

1127
01:02:12,646 --> 01:02:15,607
We are getting closer.

1128
01:02:15,691 --> 01:02:20,195
...until you reach
the Cave of the Reflexión!

1129
01:02:20,279 --> 01:02:23,615
Where entering is deadly...

1130
01:02:23,699 --> 01:02:28,412
and escape impossible!

1131
01:02:28,495 --> 01:02:30,581
Okay, we get it!

1132
01:02:30,664 --> 01:02:32,708
Uh, you okay there, honey?

1133
01:02:32,791 --> 01:02:34,376
Oh, hey. Yes.

1134
01:02:34,460 --> 01:02:35,586
Everything is fine.

1135
01:02:58,525 --> 01:03:01,236
- Whoa!
- Murray!

1136
01:03:02,696 --> 01:03:04,114
Rocks!

1137
01:03:12,998 --> 01:03:14,249
Uh-oh. Look!

1138
01:03:23,217 --> 01:03:24,468
Whoa!

1139
01:03:27,221 --> 01:03:29,097
Whew.

1140
01:03:29,181 --> 01:03:31,099
Mom! Wesley's touching me!

1141
01:03:31,183 --> 01:03:32,976
She touched me first!

1142
01:03:33,060 --> 01:03:34,561
Yeah!

1143
01:03:34,645 --> 01:03:36,313
Oh, my shoes!

1144
01:03:36,396 --> 01:03:37,940
Ah, we're going down!

1145
01:03:38,023 --> 01:03:39,942
Sorry, Blobs, you're on your own.

1146
01:03:40,025 --> 01:03:42,027
I can't swim! I'm afraid of sharks!

1147
01:03:42,110 --> 01:03:43,237
Ow! Hey, that's my face!

1148
01:03:43,320 --> 01:03:45,155
- Ouch!
- You're stepping on me!

1149
01:03:45,239 --> 01:03:46,698
- Get out of my way!
- Ow! Hey!

1150
01:03:46,782 --> 01:03:48,408
Get off my h... Ow!

1151
01:03:48,492 --> 01:03:50,661
- Ow! Oh!
- Stop it! Ow!

1152
01:03:53,914 --> 01:03:55,832
Huh?

1153
01:04:00,254 --> 01:04:02,297
We found it.

1154
01:04:06,969 --> 01:04:08,387
Let me go first.

1155
01:04:08,470 --> 01:04:10,639
No, let me go.

1156
01:04:36,123 --> 01:04:38,125
Wow.

1157
01:04:38,208 --> 01:04:40,043
Dracula mean!

1158
01:04:40,127 --> 01:04:42,129
Dracula liar!

1159
01:04:42,212 --> 01:04:45,173
Johnny mad!

1160
01:04:45,257 --> 01:04:48,218
Johnny, please! You have to calm down.

1161
01:04:48,302 --> 01:04:49,886
Whoa!

1162
01:04:51,680 --> 01:04:53,932
Sorry, sweetie, got to take this.

1163
01:04:55,559 --> 01:04:56,685
Ericka?

1164
01:04:56,768 --> 01:04:58,395
Mavis, we found the crystal cave.

1165
01:04:58,478 --> 01:05:00,564
Oh, that's great news.

1166
01:05:00,647 --> 01:05:02,691
Okay, I'm sending you the location now.

1167
01:05:02,774 --> 01:05:04,109
Got it. I'll get him there.

1168
01:05:04,192 --> 01:05:05,944
Are you sure? Is he close?

1169
01:05:10,115 --> 01:05:11,950
Yep, pretty close.

1170
01:05:14,786 --> 01:05:16,246
Sorry about this, honey.

1171
01:05:17,748 --> 01:05:18,749
Huh?

1172
01:05:18,832 --> 01:05:20,792
Hey, sweetie.

1173
01:05:23,629 --> 01:05:26,131
Starting route to your destination.

1174
01:05:26,214 --> 01:05:27,215
Oh.

1175
01:05:33,930 --> 01:05:35,682
Okay, everybody,

1176
01:05:35,766 --> 01:05:38,018
the crystal has to be here somewhere.

1177
01:05:44,608 --> 01:05:49,404
We'll find it as long as we stay focused
and don't get...

1178
01:05:49,488 --> 01:05:51,490
separated.

1179
01:05:51,573 --> 01:05:53,283
Drac, where are you?

1180
01:05:53,367 --> 01:05:55,077
Murray, is that you?

1181
01:05:55,160 --> 01:05:56,745
Hey, Eunice, where'd you go?

1182
01:05:56,828 --> 01:05:58,705
I'm right here. Where are you?

1183
01:05:58,789 --> 01:06:01,708
Okay, just calm down. Nobody panic.

1184
01:06:01,792 --> 01:06:04,836
Guys? Guys, Blobby is freaking out.

1185
01:06:04,920 --> 01:06:06,880
- So am I.
- Murray?

1186
01:06:06,963 --> 01:06:08,674
He's right here. Oh, wait.

1187
01:06:08,757 --> 01:06:10,717
No, false alarm. That's a pointy rock.

1188
01:06:10,801 --> 01:06:12,469
Guys, Blobby's really losing it!

1189
01:06:12,552 --> 01:06:14,763
- Stay in one place!
- Frank!

1190
01:06:14,846 --> 01:06:17,265
- Where am I?!
- Uh, what's happening?

1191
01:06:17,349 --> 01:06:18,433
Someone, find me!

1192
01:06:18,517 --> 01:06:20,352
- What do we do?
- Where are we?

1193
01:06:20,435 --> 01:06:21,478
We're lost!

1194
01:06:21,561 --> 01:06:23,814
How do we get out of here?!

1195
01:06:32,531 --> 01:06:33,824
Which way?

1196
01:06:33,907 --> 01:06:35,867
Sorry, I didn't quite get that.

1197
01:06:35,951 --> 01:06:37,744
Calculating new route.

1198
01:06:39,121 --> 01:06:40,372
Make a sharp left.

1199
01:06:44,501 --> 01:06:46,086
Whoa!

1200
01:06:53,719 --> 01:06:55,971
Your destination is on the right.

1201
01:07:04,354 --> 01:07:06,481
Okay, honey, just wait here.

1202
01:07:06,565 --> 01:07:07,733
I'll be right back.

1203
01:07:22,456 --> 01:07:25,333
Hello? Dad? Ericka?

1204
01:07:25,417 --> 01:07:26,877
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

1205
01:07:26,960 --> 01:07:29,045
Murray?

1206
01:07:30,547 --> 01:07:32,048
Hold me. I'm scared.

1207
01:07:32,132 --> 01:07:34,134
Huh?

1208
01:07:34,217 --> 01:07:35,594
Blobby?

1209
01:07:35,677 --> 01:07:36,720
Whoa!

1210
01:07:37,929 --> 01:07:39,723
Mavis!

1211
01:07:39,806 --> 01:07:41,141
Ouchy.

1212
01:07:41,224 --> 01:07:42,768
Oh, Dad, it's you.

1213
01:07:42,851 --> 01:07:44,936
Yes, of course it's me.

1214
01:07:45,020 --> 01:07:47,230
Ow. I think my nose is broken.

1215
01:07:47,314 --> 01:07:48,607
What is going on?

1216
01:07:48,690 --> 01:07:51,151
- Did you find the crystal?
- Ugh, the crystal?

1217
01:07:51,234 --> 01:07:54,112
We can't even find each other.
It's cuckoo in here.

1218
01:07:54,196 --> 01:07:56,114
But wait. You've come back.

1219
01:07:56,198 --> 01:07:57,365
You're not mad anymore?

1220
01:07:57,449 --> 01:07:58,950
Of course I'm still mad.

1221
01:07:59,034 --> 01:08:00,577
But we need to save Johnny.

1222
01:08:13,340 --> 01:08:15,342
- Johnny?
- Oh, no.

1223
01:08:20,430 --> 01:08:22,599
Mavis!

1224
01:08:22,682 --> 01:08:24,851
- You okay, Mavey?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

1225
01:08:24,935 --> 01:08:26,353
Go, go, go!

1226
01:08:37,322 --> 01:08:39,449
Keep moving, legs.

1227
01:08:44,579 --> 01:08:46,456
- Wendy, Wally, Wilma, Wyatt...
- Is this all of them?

1228
01:08:46,540 --> 01:08:47,999
Not even close!

1229
01:08:50,085 --> 01:08:52,045
Whoa!

1230
01:08:53,213 --> 01:08:54,464
Huh?

1231
01:08:57,008 --> 01:08:59,344
If he ruins my hair,
I'm never gonna forgive him!

1232
01:09:02,556 --> 01:09:03,932
Ooh.

1233
01:09:07,143 --> 01:09:08,562
Huh?

1234
01:09:17,487 --> 01:09:19,406
Oh. Huh?

1235
01:09:21,408 --> 01:09:22,534
Is that...

1236
01:09:22,617 --> 01:09:24,619
The crystal! Thank you, Johnny!

1237
01:09:26,663 --> 01:09:28,248
Go!

1238
01:09:37,507 --> 01:09:39,676
Please don't be too late.

1239
01:09:49,394 --> 01:09:50,812
Whoa! Whoa!

1240
01:09:54,274 --> 01:09:55,483
Whoa.

1241
01:10:01,406 --> 01:10:02,407
Huh?

1242
01:10:02,490 --> 01:10:03,783
Hey, kiddo.

1243
01:10:03,867 --> 01:10:05,535
Thanks, Uncle Frank.

1244
01:10:05,619 --> 01:10:07,245
That's it!

1245
01:10:07,329 --> 01:10:08,663
I need to get up there!

1246
01:10:08,747 --> 01:10:09,873
Don't worry.

1247
01:10:09,956 --> 01:10:11,207
We got you covered!

1248
01:10:13,919 --> 01:10:15,462
What are you standing around for?

1249
01:10:15,545 --> 01:10:16,546
Go, go, go!

1250
01:10:26,097 --> 01:10:27,265
Stop moving.

1251
01:10:27,349 --> 01:10:28,600
- Ow! Watch it!
- Let me get balanced.

1252
01:10:28,683 --> 01:10:29,684
Ow!

1253
01:10:29,768 --> 01:10:30,936
Okay, Mavis!

1254
01:10:33,063 --> 01:10:34,481
Whoa!

1255
01:10:37,484 --> 01:10:39,527
Ready, Murray?

1256
01:10:39,611 --> 01:10:40,695
Murray?

1257
01:10:42,030 --> 01:10:43,698
Murray!

1258
01:10:43,782 --> 01:10:45,408
I'm awake! What are we doing?

1259
01:10:53,458 --> 01:10:56,378
Okay, Johnny, please still be in there.

1260
01:11:06,721 --> 01:11:07,764
What?

1261
01:11:12,185 --> 01:11:14,145
We're too late.

1262
01:11:14,229 --> 01:11:15,981
No! It can't be!

1263
01:11:16,064 --> 01:11:17,399
Huh?

1264
01:11:21,236 --> 01:11:22,654
Sorry about this, Blobby.

1265
01:11:28,535 --> 01:11:31,454
Johnny...!

1266
01:11:32,247 --> 01:11:33,873
Dad!

1267
01:11:36,710 --> 01:11:38,586
Johnny!

1268
01:11:44,968 --> 01:11:47,595
Johnny?

1269
01:11:47,679 --> 01:11:51,474
Johnny, you are the marshmallow!

1270
01:11:51,558 --> 01:11:52,684
Huh?

1271
01:11:52,767 --> 01:11:53,768
Huh?

1272
01:11:53,852 --> 01:11:55,395
Wait, he had a marshmallow on him?

1273
01:11:55,478 --> 01:11:59,065
You said that if I only saw
the worst in things,

1274
01:11:59,149 --> 01:12:01,192
I would miss the best parts.

1275
01:12:01,276 --> 01:12:03,278
And you were right.

1276
01:12:03,361 --> 01:12:07,282
I was so worried that you would
ruin everything I cared about

1277
01:12:07,365 --> 01:12:09,743
that I didn't see...

1278
01:12:09,826 --> 01:12:11,995
I didn't see you.

1279
01:12:12,078 --> 01:12:13,955
Your-your kindness,

1280
01:12:14,039 --> 01:12:16,041
y-your energy, your...

1281
01:12:16,124 --> 01:12:18,585
your Johnnyness.

1282
01:12:18,668 --> 01:12:22,255
Before you, my life was like
a burnt marshmallow,

1283
01:12:22,338 --> 01:12:25,633
hard and crunchy and sad.

1284
01:12:25,717 --> 01:12:30,472
But you cracked it open
and became the ooey-gooey center

1285
01:12:30,555 --> 01:12:32,348
of all of our lives.

1286
01:12:32,432 --> 01:12:34,642
We're dead.

1287
01:12:36,269 --> 01:12:41,149
What I'm trying to say is that
you are part of the family.

1288
01:12:41,232 --> 01:12:42,901
My family.

1289
01:12:42,984 --> 01:12:46,905
I can't believe it took becoming a human
to finally realize it.

1290
01:12:46,988 --> 01:12:50,325
And I'm sorry it's taken me
so long to say it,

1291
01:12:50,408 --> 01:12:53,119
and maybe now it's too late,

1292
01:12:53,203 --> 01:12:58,374
but you taught me to look
for the good in everything.

1293
01:12:58,458 --> 01:13:02,545
And now I see that so much
of the good in my life

1294
01:13:02,629 --> 01:13:04,714
is because of you.

1295
01:13:04,798 --> 01:13:07,008
Dra...

1296
01:13:07,092 --> 01:13:08,134
Drac?

1297
01:13:08,218 --> 01:13:09,886
Johnny!

1298
01:13:09,969 --> 01:13:11,763
Drac.

1299
01:13:29,697 --> 01:13:31,616
Johnny!

1300
01:13:31,699 --> 01:13:33,243
Mavis!

1301
01:13:47,423 --> 01:13:48,842
Hey.

1302
01:13:48,925 --> 01:13:50,468
Not bad, huh?

1303
01:13:58,017 --> 01:13:59,018
Much better.

1304
01:14:05,567 --> 01:14:07,318
I miss being Walter. Ow!

1305
01:14:07,402 --> 01:14:08,778
Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa! No-no!

1306
01:14:08,862 --> 01:14:10,446
You-you are keeping those on!

1307
01:14:10,530 --> 01:14:12,657
Don't be so uptight. I'm inviz.

1308
01:14:12,740 --> 01:14:14,742
Man, just because you're invisible

1309
01:14:14,826 --> 01:14:16,703
doesn't mean you get to be naked.

1310
01:14:16,786 --> 01:14:18,121
What is wrong with you?

1311
01:14:18,204 --> 01:14:20,123
All right, Blobby, you're up.

1312
01:14:24,794 --> 01:14:27,505
Uh... looking good?

1313
01:14:36,431 --> 01:14:38,892
Oh.

1314
01:14:44,272 --> 01:14:46,649
Go ahead. Now's your chance.

1315
01:14:47,650 --> 01:14:50,695
Hey, it was fun being a monster
for a little bit.

1316
01:14:50,778 --> 01:14:52,822
I wonder if Van Helsing
can adjust this thing

1317
01:14:52,906 --> 01:14:55,283
so that I'm a monster but still me.

1318
01:14:55,366 --> 01:14:58,077
- I don't think so.
- Ah, come on.

1319
01:14:58,161 --> 01:15:00,747
- How 'bout just a tail?
- No, Johnny.

1320
01:15:00,830 --> 01:15:03,291
You're perfect just the way you are.

1321
01:15:03,374 --> 01:15:05,668
Uh, Mavey? Johnny?

1322
01:15:05,752 --> 01:15:07,754
- Yes?
- Well, I-I...

1323
01:15:07,837 --> 01:15:09,214
I know a lot has happened,

1324
01:15:09,297 --> 01:15:13,218
but I was hoping that, uh,

1325
01:15:13,301 --> 01:15:17,222
if-if you're still interested,
I, uh...

1326
01:15:17,305 --> 01:15:20,934
I wanted to say that the hotel...

1327
01:15:21,017 --> 01:15:23,102
that the hotel is

1328
01:15:23,186 --> 01:15:25,521
- destroyed!
- JOHNNY and MAVIS: Huh?!

1329
01:15:28,066 --> 01:15:29,901
What happened?!

1330
01:15:41,454 --> 01:15:44,082
My... my...

1331
01:15:44,165 --> 01:15:46,042
my hotel!

1332
01:15:46,125 --> 01:15:48,336
My hotel, my hotel, my hotel!

1333
01:15:48,419 --> 01:15:51,506
My hotel!

1334
01:15:59,013 --> 01:16:03,017
My... my hotel.

1335
01:16:03,101 --> 01:16:04,602
My hotel.

1336
01:16:05,603 --> 01:16:07,522
My hotel.

1337
01:16:07,605 --> 01:16:09,732
My hotel.

1338
01:16:09,816 --> 01:16:11,609
My hotel.

1339
01:16:15,154 --> 01:16:17,657
- Oh, no.
- Oh, man, this is unbelievable.

1340
01:16:21,577 --> 01:16:23,454
Hi, Mama! Hi, Papa!

1341
01:16:23,538 --> 01:16:25,581
MAVIS and JOHNNY:
Dennis!

1342
01:16:34,048 --> 01:16:35,800
Don't worry, Drac.

1343
01:16:35,883 --> 01:16:38,094
We'll rebuild it just the way it was.

1344
01:16:39,345 --> 01:16:40,513
No.

1345
01:16:42,473 --> 01:16:45,518
Rebuild it the way you want to.

1346
01:16:48,021 --> 01:16:50,064
It's your hotel now.

1347
01:16:51,941 --> 01:16:53,818
Dad, are you sure?

1348
01:16:55,653 --> 01:16:59,407
It's time to begin a new chapter.

1349
01:17:08,583 --> 01:17:12,503
Okay, Drac, open your eyes!

1350
01:17:17,467 --> 01:17:20,428
The... the hotel!

1351
01:17:20,511 --> 01:17:22,388
I-I don't understand.

1352
01:17:22,472 --> 01:17:24,682
It-It's exactly the same.

1353
01:17:24,766 --> 01:17:29,145
Well, we just made
a couple of tiny adjustments.

1354
01:17:29,228 --> 01:17:30,646
