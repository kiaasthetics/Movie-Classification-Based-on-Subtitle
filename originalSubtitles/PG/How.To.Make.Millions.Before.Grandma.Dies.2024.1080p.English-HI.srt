[grass rustling]

3
00:00:57,833 --> 00:00:59,541
[birds singing distantly]

4
00:01:04,541 --> 00:01:06,625
[Grandma] Honor to the Exalted One,

5
00:01:06,708 --> 00:01:09,833
the Worthy One, the Fully Enlightened One.

6
00:01:10,750 --> 00:01:15,041
Honor to the Exalted One, the Worthy One, the Fully Enlightened One.

7
00:01:16,375 --> 00:01:21,500
Honor to the Exalted One, the Worthy One, the Fully Enlightened One.

8
00:01:22,291 --> 00:01:23,791
Ma, why are you praying here?

9
00:01:24,625 --> 00:01:26,500
Do you even know whose plot this is?

10
00:01:27,875 --> 00:01:30,000
Sort of. It's a prayer for the future.

11
00:01:30,083 --> 00:01:32,666
I ask the sacred beings to bring me a plot like this one.

12
00:01:32,750 --> 00:01:35,208
- [vehicle approaching] - Oh, I think they'll grant you your wish.

13
00:01:35,291 --> 00:01:37,208
- For a million baht. - [car door opens and closes]

14
00:01:37,291 --> 00:01:38,125
[M] Ma?

15
00:01:38,875 --> 00:01:39,916
Are you done?

16
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,791
The owners wanna pay their respects.

17
00:01:41,875 --> 00:01:43,333
[chair lift whirring]

18
00:01:43,916 --> 00:01:44,750
[Soei] Oh.

19
00:01:46,375 --> 00:01:47,541
Hold on just a second.

20
00:01:49,125 --> 00:01:50,041
This way, Ma.

21
00:01:53,083 --> 00:01:55,250
[wistful piano music playing]

22
00:01:56,208 --> 00:01:57,583
Thank you. Thank you.

23
00:01:57,666 --> 00:01:59,541
[firecrackers crackling and popping]

24
00:02:04,291 --> 00:02:07,166
[Sew] You can be buried in a shared plot like this.

25
00:02:07,250 --> 00:02:09,125
And be close to your parents.

26
00:02:09,208 --> 00:02:11,500
It's comfortable and reasonable.

27
00:02:11,583 --> 00:02:13,125
Please don't listen to her.

28
00:02:14,166 --> 00:02:17,333
I'll buy you your dream. Getting a million is easy these days.

29
00:02:17,416 --> 00:02:19,833
[Grandma] Get away from me. Your cigarettes stink.

30
00:02:19,916 --> 00:02:22,208
- Mwah! - [Grandma groans]

31
00:02:22,291 --> 00:02:25,041
[Grandma] Try paying me back what I lent you first.

32
00:02:25,125 --> 00:02:26,250
You hear me, Soei?

33
00:02:26,333 --> 00:02:28,250
It's a few hundred thousand, isn't it?

34
00:02:28,333 --> 00:02:29,166
I don't know.

35
00:02:29,250 --> 00:02:32,416
- I only remember the good things in life. - Isn't that practical.

36
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:34,000
- Hey. - Don't step over them.

37
00:02:34,083 --> 00:02:37,250
And Sew, why do you always get this wrong?

38
00:02:37,333 --> 00:02:40,958
You put the duck and chicken butts facing your grandparents' faces again.

39
00:02:41,041 --> 00:02:43,208
How does it go? M?

40
00:02:44,041 --> 00:02:45,958
YAFANG ZHENG QINXING ZHOU

41
00:02:46,041 --> 00:02:47,625
- M! - M.

[gentle piano music playing]

43
00:02:50,708 --> 00:02:51,875
[Sew] Come and help us.

44
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:55,208
I laid the mat down for you, Ma.

45
00:02:55,833 --> 00:02:57,250
[Sew] You must be exhausted.

46
00:03:02,875 --> 00:03:04,666
[firecrackers popping distantly]

47
00:03:06,791 --> 00:03:08,291
- [M] Hmm. - Bad boy.

48
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,250
Wait for the ceremony.

49
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,500
Qing Ming is sacred.

50
00:03:13,583 --> 00:03:15,416
We honor the dead, not silly games.

51
00:03:16,458 --> 00:03:18,458
Give me a break. I'm here, aren't I?

52
00:03:18,541 --> 00:03:19,958
His family couldn't bother.

53
00:03:21,333 --> 00:03:22,791
[Pinn, over phone] Well, that's nice.

54
00:03:23,291 --> 00:03:24,208
Very pretty.

55
00:03:24,291 --> 00:03:27,375
- Yes, everybody came out today. - [Pinn] I see that. Is it hot?

56
00:03:27,458 --> 00:03:28,500
Not bad, actually.

57
00:03:29,416 --> 00:03:32,791
I guess you won't be coming? I'll light some incense for you, okay?

58
00:03:32,875 --> 00:03:35,791
- Oh, Ma. Say hi to Grandma. - [Pinn] Rainbow, smile. Say hi to Grandma.

59
00:03:37,125 --> 00:03:38,708
Morning, Grandma.

60
00:03:38,791 --> 00:03:39,750
[Rainbow groans]

61
00:03:40,750 --> 00:03:42,458
- Morning… - It's once a year, Kiang.

62
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:45,041
We honor our ancestors.

63
00:03:45,750 --> 00:03:48,125
Rainbow and Pinn have never paid their respects.

64
00:03:48,833 --> 00:03:50,083
[whispers] Wait a second.

65
00:03:52,333 --> 00:03:53,375
[flies buzzing]

66
00:03:53,458 --> 00:03:54,666
[Grandma] Scatter these on top.

67
00:03:58,125 --> 00:03:59,166
[M sighs]

68
00:03:59,250 --> 00:04:00,541
[Sew] What a face.

69
00:04:03,875 --> 00:04:05,625
[gentle piano music playing]

70
00:04:15,541 --> 00:04:18,166
Oh, I said scatter, not dump.

71
00:04:18,666 --> 00:04:20,583
Can't you even try? Huh?

72
00:04:21,166 --> 00:04:23,166
- So lazy. - What does it matter how we do it?

73
00:04:23,250 --> 00:04:25,416
The ancestors are up in the clouds, Grandma.

74
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:26,375
[sighs]

75
00:04:27,208 --> 00:04:29,541
Can you not be such a qi-chou for once?

76
00:04:30,791 --> 00:04:31,750
Hmm?

77
00:04:33,083 --> 00:04:34,625
A good-for-nothing slacker.

78
00:04:34,708 --> 00:04:36,708
[firecrackers popping distantly]

79
00:04:38,083 --> 00:04:39,041
[scoffs]

80
00:04:39,125 --> 00:04:41,250
[Sew] Ma, you shouldn't be up there. You could fall.

81
00:04:43,291 --> 00:04:45,291
They'll be scattered by the wind anyway.

82
00:04:45,875 --> 00:04:47,208
[Soei] Stubborn as a mule.

83
00:04:49,083 --> 00:04:50,416
[Sew] Come down, please!

84
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,541
[Soei] You're looking for trouble, Ma. Let him do that.

85
00:04:54,041 --> 00:04:54,875
And!

86
00:04:54,958 --> 00:04:57,083
[Sew] Come down before you break your neck!

87
00:04:57,791 --> 00:04:59,000
- Well! Must! - [Soei] Hey, Ma!

88
00:04:59,625 --> 00:05:02,000
[man] Someone from the family will need to fill out the forms.

89
00:05:02,083 --> 00:05:03,250
- [Soei] Okay. - [man] Thank you.

90
00:05:04,333 --> 00:05:05,250
Bye, Ma.

91
00:05:06,208 --> 00:05:08,458
Sis, you gotta go fill out the forms.

92
00:05:10,291 --> 00:05:11,583
I have to go.

93
00:05:12,125 --> 00:05:13,958
I need to take Rainbow to the store.

94
00:05:14,041 --> 00:05:16,166
I'll leave you guys money to pay for today.

95
00:05:17,250 --> 00:05:18,708
I left my bike at your house.

96
00:05:18,791 --> 00:05:19,916
- I need to get it. - Oh yeah.

97
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Why don't I ride back to your house with you?

98
00:05:22,083 --> 00:05:24,208
And then I'll come back and stay with her.

99
00:05:24,291 --> 00:05:25,458
That's ridiculous.

100
00:05:25,541 --> 00:05:28,041
I mean, Kiang lives out in the boonies. It'll take you too long.

101
00:05:28,125 --> 00:05:29,500
I'll stay with her for now.

102
00:05:29,583 --> 00:05:31,250
- All right. Okay, out. - Go.

103
00:05:33,166 --> 00:05:34,000
M!

104
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:36,166
Are you going by the MRT, Uncle?

105
00:05:36,250 --> 00:05:37,583
Yeah. Why?

106
00:05:37,666 --> 00:05:39,125
Could drop me off there?

107
00:05:39,625 --> 00:05:40,625
Now?

108
00:05:41,291 --> 00:05:43,625
Oh, okay. Here. Let's go.

109
00:05:43,708 --> 00:05:45,583
[Soei] Thanks. See you later, Sew.

110
00:05:54,875 --> 00:05:57,083
[M] This place is full of talismans, guys.

111
00:05:57,750 --> 00:05:59,750
[video game character panting]

112
00:06:02,541 --> 00:06:05,083
Ah! Evil spirit!

113
00:06:05,166 --> 00:06:06,750
Ah!

114
00:06:06,833 --> 00:06:09,000
I'm scared of ghosts! Take that!

115
00:06:10,791 --> 00:06:13,791
- Wait, where'd it go, guys? Where'd it go? - A measly four viewers, today?

116
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:15,875
Ma, everyone can hear you!

117
00:06:22,916 --> 00:06:24,125
And…

118
00:06:24,208 --> 00:06:26,916
Why don't you relax? You've been on your feet all day.

119
00:06:32,625 --> 00:06:34,166
Did you read my text?

120
00:06:35,416 --> 00:06:37,083
Another computer for gaming.

121
00:06:37,625 --> 00:06:39,125
Why do you wanna use my card?

122
00:06:39,750 --> 00:06:41,416
You have your own card. Use that.

123
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:43,916
It's maxed out. The bank threatened to freeze it.

124
00:06:47,458 --> 00:06:48,500
I hope they do that.

125
00:06:48,583 --> 00:06:50,041
Teach you a lesson.

126
00:06:50,125 --> 00:06:53,083
And if your internet gets cut off again, I won't pay for it.

127
00:06:53,625 --> 00:06:56,000
What did you say when you decided to quit school

128
00:06:56,083 --> 00:06:58,458
to become a gamecaster from our living room?

129
00:06:59,541 --> 00:07:00,791
You'd be rich in no time.

130
00:07:01,291 --> 00:07:02,791
You would rent your own house.

131
00:07:03,291 --> 00:07:04,916
That you'd give me an allowance.

132
00:07:06,083 --> 00:07:08,166
I want to retire when I'm 60.

133
00:07:08,250 --> 00:07:09,750
I know you do.

134
00:07:11,666 --> 00:07:13,375
Don't kick a man when he's down.

135
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:14,916
It hurts.

136
00:07:18,583 --> 00:07:20,625
[video game music plays faintly]

137
00:07:29,916 --> 00:07:31,625
When Grandma went to the hospital…

138
00:07:33,375 --> 00:07:37,291
she mentioned to the doctor that she's had stomachaches and blood in her stool.

139
00:07:39,166 --> 00:07:40,916
So they did tests while she was there.

140
00:07:41,416 --> 00:07:43,041
This morning, I got the results.

141
00:07:48,041 --> 00:07:49,166
Grandma has cancer.

142
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,375
It's in the final stages.

143
00:07:55,458 --> 00:07:57,083
She probably has 12 months.

144
00:07:57,166 --> 00:07:58,125
You're dead!

145
00:07:58,666 --> 00:08:00,458
Jeez, they won't listen.

146
00:08:01,750 --> 00:08:02,916
- Man… - [Sew sighs]

147
00:08:05,208 --> 00:08:07,625
Anyway, M, I expect you to spend time with her.

148
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,625
But don't mention her diagnosis.

149
00:08:11,250 --> 00:08:12,583
I don't want her to worry.

150
00:08:13,291 --> 00:08:15,041
What'll you give me to go see Grandma?

151
00:08:16,041 --> 00:08:17,625
My time is money now, yeah?

152
00:08:19,916 --> 00:08:21,416

00:08:37,708 --> 00:08:40,375
You need to keep updating the app. That's why it's freezing.

My grandpa says you need to eat more. You're too skinny. Hmm.

162
00:08:51,875 --> 00:08:54,833
How do you know what he said? All his grunts sound the same.

163
00:08:55,666 --> 00:08:57,125
[Mui] Actually, I made it up.

164
00:08:57,208 --> 00:08:59,125
He probably said that you're blocking his view.

165

[Grandpa groans]

Whoa, Grandpa!

168
00:09:04,666 --> 00:09:05,916
You still got it!

- [Grandpa chuckles] - [laughs]

170
00:09:09,541 --> 00:09:11,750
Your diaper feels full. I'm gonna change it, okay?

171
00:09:11,833 --> 00:09:12,666
[Grandpa] Mm-hmm.

172
00:09:15,708 --> 00:09:16,708

He divvied up his inheritance a while ago,

but he didn't want to reveal anything until after his death.

206
00:11:16,291 --> 00:11:18,666
Which means I'm the lucky one to get all the grief.

Helping him? You?

209
00:11:24,291 --> 00:11:26,875
Of course not. He left almost everything to Mui.

I was the mother, you were the father.

359
00:21:12,375 --> 00:21:14,041
And we cuddled under the blanket.

360
00:21:14,125 --> 00:21:15,125
Uh, yeah.

361
00:21:15,666 --> 00:21:16,791
I remember now.

362
00:21:16,875 --> 00:21:17,791
We did.

363
00:21:19,583 --> 00:21:22,083
So tell me why you want to look after your Grandma.

364
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:28,916
So I can get a place of my own.

365
00:21:30,083 --> 00:21:32,208
It takes so long when you're not privileged.

366
00:21:32,916 --> 00:21:35,250
Some people are just born with a head start.

367
00:21:35,333 --> 00:21:37,333
They're rich or inherit a business.

368
00:21:37,416 --> 00:21:39,375
So you think of Grandma as an asset?

369
00:21:46,208 --> 00:21:47,041
[M] Hmm…

370
00:21:49,583 --> 00:21:50,500
That's harsh.

371
00:21:56,791 --> 00:21:58,166
Do you think it's so wrong…

372
00:21:59,458 --> 00:22:00,375
what we're doing?

373
00:22:10,458 --> 00:22:11,291
Hmm?

374
00:22:25,500 --> 00:22:26,416
[Mui] Honestly?

375
00:22:27,500 --> 00:22:29,625
I really hate Grandpa's kids.

376
00:22:31,583 --> 00:22:33,958
They would come once a week for 15 minutes.

377
00:22:35,875 --> 00:22:37,291
So why even bother?

378
00:22:41,791 --> 00:22:42,708
It's time.

379
00:22:43,875 --> 00:22:44,708
[M] Hmm?

380
00:22:46,041 --> 00:22:48,458
Our time is what they're really craving the most.

381
00:22:51,333 --> 00:22:53,291
It doesn't matter what we're there for.

382
00:23:02,625 --> 00:23:04,083
How'd you skip over everyone?

383
00:23:05,125 --> 00:23:06,416
And get to be number one?

384
00:23:09,291 --> 00:23:10,208
Do you know what

385
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:13,750
older people want more than anything each day,

386
00:23:13,833 --> 00:23:16,458
but most of their children are not willing to offer?

387
00:23:23,708 --> 00:23:25,333
To not count the minutes.

388
00:23:27,500 --> 00:23:29,041
But I was with her all day.

389
00:23:37,625 --> 00:23:39,208
Did you think she smelled funny

390
00:23:39,958 --> 00:23:41,125
when you were with her?

391
00:23:43,375 --> 00:23:44,875
Old people just smell.

392
00:23:47,625 --> 00:23:50,125
You notice it because you don't spend enough time with her.

393
00:23:51,375 --> 00:23:53,583
You'll know you have when you stop noticing.

394
00:23:55,291 --> 00:23:58,333
Grandpa was incontinent, but I became immune to it.

395
00:24:05,250 --> 00:24:07,708
[tender music playing]

396
00:24:12,708 --> 00:24:13,666
[camera shutters click]

397
00:24:14,791 --> 00:24:16,125
- Whoa! - [objects crash]

398
00:24:27,333 --> 00:24:28,833
[panting softly]

399
00:24:31,583 --> 00:24:32,583
[sighs]

400
00:24:34,958 --> 00:24:36,916
I'll buy you back when I get the money.

401
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:37,958
Wow.

402
00:24:38,458 --> 00:24:40,458
[piano music playing]

403
00:24:46,083 --> 00:24:48,291
So you're going to be moving in with Grandma?

404
00:24:51,583 --> 00:24:53,416
I'm doing what you wanted, aren't I?

405
00:24:56,250 --> 00:24:58,000
[humming]

406
00:25:00,833 --> 00:25:02,833
[uplifting orchestral music playing]

407
00:25:13,833 --> 00:25:15,333
Breaking into houses now?

408
00:25:16,708 --> 00:25:18,458
I used the key that you gave to Ma.

409
00:25:20,166 --> 00:25:21,791
What's with all this stuff?

410
00:25:21,875 --> 00:25:23,166
I brought some,

411
00:25:23,250 --> 00:25:24,875
and I bought some of it.

412
00:25:25,791 --> 00:25:26,791
And this is for you.

413
00:25:27,500 --> 00:25:29,083
I made it selling stuff online.

414
00:25:31,916 --> 00:25:33,875
Tell me why everyone's visiting now.

415
00:25:36,333 --> 00:25:38,000
If all those tests say I'm fine,

416
00:25:39,291 --> 00:25:40,708
I don't need all this fuss.

417
00:25:45,833 --> 00:25:47,083
[chair scrapes]

418
00:25:48,125 --> 00:25:50,666
[woman on TV] But the traditional methods endure.

419
00:25:50,750 --> 00:25:55,208
The charcoal-burning industry at Ban Khon Huay Nang is a mainstay…

420
00:25:55,291 --> 00:25:57,291
They gave Ma the results of the tests you did.

421
00:25:57,375 --> 00:25:59,583
The traditions have been handed down for generations.

422
00:25:59,666 --> 00:26:00,625
Most things look good.

423
00:26:00,708 --> 00:26:03,458
The industry is steady, but faces constant challenges.

424
00:26:03,541 --> 00:26:04,583
But you have cancer.

425
00:26:04,666 --> 00:26:07,125
Wood and sawdust prices have increased and added pressure.

426
00:26:07,208 --> 00:26:09,041
And Ma and the uncles don't want you to know.

427
00:26:09,125 --> 00:26:13,500
Prices for other materials used in the process have also increased.

428
00:26:13,583 --> 00:26:15,250
Battery prices have gone up…

429
00:26:15,333 --> 00:26:16,500
Is it serious?

430
00:26:17,541 --> 00:26:19,583
- …by an average of 20%. - It's stage four.

431
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:22,458
They've given you a year.

432
00:26:24,083 --> 00:26:25,708
But you don't need to listen to them.

433
00:26:25,791 --> 00:26:28,583
Doctors, sometimes they think they can predict the future.

434
00:26:29,083 --> 00:26:30,916
Remember what they told Yen down the street?

435
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:32,750
Six months if she was lucky.

436
00:26:32,833 --> 00:26:35,416
And now it's been ten years, and she's still bossing everyone around

437
00:26:35,500 --> 00:26:36,583
in that big house of hers.

438
00:26:40,666 --> 00:26:43,666
However, the ancient methods attract tourists…

439
00:26:43,750 --> 00:26:45,666
I had such a great time as a kid here.

440
00:26:46,291 --> 00:26:47,958
You were so good to Ma and me.

441
00:26:48,041 --> 00:26:50,083
These traditional work methods…

442
00:26:50,166 --> 00:26:52,416
Now I think it's time I did something for you.

443
00:26:54,958 --> 00:26:56,041
I have time.

444
00:26:57,708 --> 00:26:59,458
I'd like to spend it with you if I can.

445
00:26:59,541 --> 00:27:02,666
…a vital part of the local economy,

446
00:27:03,333 --> 00:27:09,625
others see them as the beginning of the end for small family enterprises

447
00:27:09,708 --> 00:27:12,458
who will not be able to compete

448
00:27:12,541 --> 00:27:15,541
with the output from more efficient…

449
00:27:16,208 --> 00:27:17,583
[Grandma] I'm off.

450
00:27:19,458 --> 00:27:22,333
[woman, on TV] They used to light 100 kilns a day.

451
00:27:22,416 --> 00:27:25,875
Now, they are able to light 200 to 300.

452
00:27:26,458 --> 00:27:28,625
As for the prices of raw materials for the kilns…

453
00:27:28,708 --> 00:27:31,041
I'll put this money towards the utility bill.

454
00:27:31,125 --> 00:27:33,166
…due in large part to shipping costs,

455
00:27:33,250 --> 00:27:37,708
making the charcoal stove business a fine balancing act for all involved.

456
00:27:37,791 --> 00:27:40,708
I'll help you sell congee tomorrow. What time do you leave?

457
00:27:43,500 --> 00:27:44,666
Five a.m.

458
00:27:44,750 --> 00:27:46,375
- [M] What? - [Grandma] Five a.m.

459
00:27:47,041 --> 00:27:48,125
Why so early?

460
00:27:48,708 --> 00:27:51,291
[Grandma] Do you expect to sell congee late in the day?

461
00:27:52,458 --> 00:27:54,375
[M] People eat congee at night too, you know.

462
00:27:56,208 --> 00:27:57,583
You can eat congee all day.

463
00:27:58,625 --> 00:28:00,083
The early bird gets the worm.

464
00:28:00,666 --> 00:28:03,750
I don't think your generation has even heard that saying.

465
00:28:04,916 --> 00:28:06,500
Have you ever heard the saying,

466
00:28:07,250 --> 00:28:10,416
"The worm that wakes up at five will not stay alive"?

467
00:28:11,083 --> 00:28:13,666
- He's the one that gets eaten first. - Hmm.

468
00:28:13,750 --> 00:28:15,125
[M] You're scowling.

[M] Why didn't you wake me up?

479
00:29:03,166 --> 00:29:05,333
[Grandma] I'm your Grandma, not an alarm clock.

[M sighs]

481
00:29:06,541 --> 00:29:08,833
- [M] I'll do this bag. - [Grandma] Oh, fine.

482
00:29:15,750 --> 00:29:18,000
Are you hiding it because you don't know what you're doing?

483
00:29:18,083 --> 00:29:19,916
- [M] Please. - [train horn blowing]

[M] If you want, I can deposit your money at the ATM.

486
00:29:27,083 --> 00:29:29,125
Then you won't have to walk to the bank now.

487
00:29:29,625 --> 00:29:30,750
[Grandma] Stop meddling.

488
00:29:30,833 --> 00:29:32,916
I take this walk to the bank every month.

489
00:29:33,750 --> 00:29:36,000
[M] I thought you might like a break from going for once.

Careful.

Oh, Ngek. How are you? Did they let you come back already?

00:29:59,500 --> 00:30:01,666
- I got back yesterday. - [Grandma] Really?

497
00:30:01,750 --> 00:30:04,291
They made me leave to give the bed to someone worse off.

You'll use my bank details behind my back.

Oh, so now you think your grandson's a thief?

516

- You watch too much TV. - Whatever. Stay there.

517
00:30:43,041 --> 00:30:45,416

This is bad. The fridge smells like a garbage can.

Why do you insist on holding on to things that are expired?

526

[Grandma] It's not expired. I can still eat it.

527

{\an8}No wonder you've got stomachaches, eating all this moldy stuff every day.

How can you two bicker before breakfast?

530
00:31:18,541 --> 00:31:21,500
Why are you sleeping in the living room instead of upstairs?

531
00:31:23,375 --> 00:31:26,000
Grandma locks her room. She doesn't want me in there.

536
00:31:45,791 --> 00:31:48,125
Hold on. The last button's undone.

537
00:31:48,208 --> 00:31:50,708
{\an8}- You trying to show off? - Leave it. It's too tight.

538
00:31:52,375 --> 00:31:54,291
I like it loose, so I can move.

539
00:31:54,375 --> 00:31:56,000
[M] Yeah, 'cause it's so tight.

540
00:31:56,083 --> 00:31:57,833
[Grandma] Why are you bothering me?

541
00:31:58,500 --> 00:32:02,000
Hey, did you steal Rainbow's sandals? Those look way too small for you.

542
00:32:02,958 --> 00:32:04,375
[Grandma] They fit perfect.

543
00:32:04,875 --> 00:32:06,583
- [M] Perfect? - [Grandma] Yes.

544
00:32:09,208 --> 00:32:10,958
- [M] That's a perfect fit? - [Grandma] Go away.

545
00:32:11,041 --> 00:32:12,541
I can dress myself, thank you.

546
00:32:12,625 --> 00:32:14,750
A perfect fit doesn't cut off circulation.

547
00:32:14,833 --> 00:32:16,791
These are my feet, not yours.

548
00:32:17,666 --> 00:32:19,541
If I can get my feet in them, they fit fine.

549
00:32:19,625 --> 00:32:20,791
What about your shoes?

550
00:32:20,875 --> 00:32:22,250
[M] Also a perfect fit.

551
00:32:22,333 --> 00:32:24,083
So why are you dressed so nice?

552
00:32:25,083 --> 00:32:26,750
She always dresses up on Sunday.

553
00:32:29,500 --> 00:32:31,000
Everyone comes on Sunday,

554
00:32:31,083 --> 00:32:33,083
which you would know if you bothered.

555
00:32:35,916 --> 00:32:37,916
[tender music playing]

556
00:32:46,208 --> 00:32:47,208
[Pinn] Here you are.

557
00:32:49,708 --> 00:32:52,000
I ordered this chicken from the Montien Hotel.

558
00:32:52,083 --> 00:32:54,208
It's where all the famous people go to eat.

559
00:32:55,500 --> 00:32:56,875
[Soei, laughing] Whoa!

560
00:32:57,666 --> 00:32:59,375
Rainbow, did you know,

561
00:32:59,458 --> 00:33:02,166
when were growing up here, we had a pet chicken downstairs?

562
00:33:02,250 --> 00:33:04,125
- Cool, huh? - I would like a baby chick.

563
00:33:04,208 --> 00:33:06,791
- I think they're the cutest in the world. - True!

564
00:33:06,875 --> 00:33:10,333
But your aunt and your dad used to chase that chicken around all day.

565
00:33:10,416 --> 00:33:12,166
Until one Chinese New Year,

566
00:33:12,833 --> 00:33:14,833
Grandma had to chop him up for dinner.

567
00:33:14,916 --> 00:33:16,666
Chop, chop, chop.

568
00:33:16,750 --> 00:33:19,333
And she made us steamed chicken, just like this one.

569
00:33:19,416 --> 00:33:22,541
Except we were so sad, we gave all our pieces to the dogs.

570
00:33:22,625 --> 00:33:24,791
- You've got the memory of an elephant. - Right, sis?

571
00:33:24,875 --> 00:33:27,291
You remember whenever Kiang cried, he would blow snot bubbles?

572
00:33:27,375 --> 00:33:28,916
- He would! - Can you stop?

573
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:31,291
I'm not here to have my baby listen to your stupid stories.

574
00:33:31,375 --> 00:33:34,083
- Why don't we look at your stickers, okay? - Relax, bro.

575
00:33:34,166 --> 00:33:37,166
Passing down the family history to the next gen is important.

576
00:33:38,750 --> 00:33:39,583
[Grandma] Kids.

577
00:33:40,250 --> 00:33:42,958
When we've finished eating, who's up for playing cards?

578
00:33:43,041 --> 00:33:45,291
- [Soei] Hmm? - When's the last time we played together?

579
00:33:45,375 --> 00:33:48,375
I see, you, Ma. you want to take your boys to the cleaners, huh?

580
00:33:48,458 --> 00:33:51,166
Crack open your safe, I'm taking you to the cleaners.

581
00:33:51,250 --> 00:33:53,500
I'd like to see you try, boy.

582
00:33:53,583 --> 00:33:55,583
- [laughs] - Ah! The big talker!

583
00:33:55,666 --> 00:33:58,000
You'll have to play without us. We have to leave.

584
00:33:58,583 --> 00:34:00,750
Rainbow has a ballet class in a little bit.

585
00:34:00,833 --> 00:34:04,833
Kiang, relax. You have time for a game or two before you have to leave.

586
00:34:04,916 --> 00:34:06,833
- Yeah, bro. - [Kiang] There's traffic to deal with.

587
00:34:06,916 --> 00:34:09,166
We need to go. Soei, you too.

588
00:34:09,250 --> 00:34:11,125
You shouldn't be playing cards either.

589
00:34:11,208 --> 00:34:12,083
Why not?

590
00:34:12,166 --> 00:34:13,416
Because Ma needs to rest.

591
00:34:15,791 --> 00:34:17,958
Ma, you still have pain in your stomach?

592
00:34:18,041 --> 00:34:20,125
Yeah, are you hurting anywhere?

593
00:34:20,208 --> 00:34:21,791
I know all about the cancer.

594
00:34:23,375 --> 00:34:24,333
Huh?

595
00:34:28,458 --> 00:34:30,041
[Grandma] M told me everything.

596
00:34:35,916 --> 00:34:37,833
Well, Grandma has a right to know what's going on.

597
00:34:37,916 --> 00:34:40,875
It's her body, and she can make her own decisions about it.

598
00:34:48,250 --> 00:34:49,750
I'll see the doctor on my own.

599
00:34:50,250 --> 00:34:52,208
I am not going to be a burden to you.

600
00:34:52,291 --> 00:34:53,291
It's not a burden.

601
00:34:54,333 --> 00:34:57,666
I'm glad you know because I think you should be getting treated, okay?

602
00:34:58,166 --> 00:35:00,125
But they made me promise to keep it quiet.

603
00:35:00,208 --> 00:35:01,208
[Kiang] What's that?

604
00:35:02,083 --> 00:35:04,000
Don't try to make yourself look like the good son.

605
00:35:04,083 --> 00:35:06,125
You barely visit, and you mooch off everyone.

606
00:35:06,208 --> 00:35:08,500
Ah. Always with the finances.

607
00:35:08,583 --> 00:35:10,750
I'd pay for more things if I had any money.

608
00:35:10,833 --> 00:35:13,250
- That's because you don't work. - I do work, okay?

609
00:35:13,333 --> 00:35:15,375
- It's been slow. - Please don't be starting that again.

610
00:35:15,458 --> 00:35:17,750
- [Kiang] I have a job. - [Sew] You're not being fair, Kiang.

611
00:35:17,833 --> 00:35:19,375
[Soei] I come here more than you do.

612
00:35:19,458 --> 00:35:20,625
My job is very demanding.

613
00:35:20,708 --> 00:35:22,416
Are you saying our work doesn't count?

614
00:35:22,500 --> 00:35:23,375
[Soei] Mm-hmm.

615
00:35:28,875 --> 00:35:31,500
When I go to school, I'll be a doctor so you can get better,

616
00:35:31,583 --> 00:35:32,500
and we'll play cards.

617
00:35:35,750 --> 00:35:36,875
[chuckles softly]

618
00:35:36,958 --> 00:35:38,708
[tender music playing]

619
00:35:46,375 --> 00:35:47,250
Don't worry, Ma.

620
00:35:47,333 --> 00:35:49,958
My friend knows all the best doctors who deal with important people.

621
00:35:50,041 --> 00:35:52,541
I'll foot the bill for your treatments, and you will beat this.

622
00:35:52,625 --> 00:35:54,166
You don't need to worry about me.

623
00:35:54,250 --> 00:35:55,625
Don't you be stubborn about this.

624
00:35:55,708 --> 00:35:57,916
When you have appointments, I will take you.

625
00:35:58,000 --> 00:35:59,750
It's my daughter's duty, Ma.

626
00:36:02,166 --> 00:36:03,000
Hey.

627
00:36:04,041 --> 00:36:07,875
Ma, when I took a dump earlier, I almost broke my neck.

628
00:36:07,958 --> 00:36:10,708
I'll install handrails so you don't slip and fall, okay?

629
00:36:11,875 --> 00:36:14,250
I am proud of my children and very thankful.

630
00:36:18,708 --> 00:36:20,625
[Soei] No need to be so dramatic.

631
00:36:21,416 --> 00:36:22,583
You'll get better soon.

632
00:36:25,458 --> 00:36:27,666
Aren't you supposed to be working at the market?

633
00:36:27,750 --> 00:36:28,791
Not until later.

634
00:36:28,875 --> 00:36:30,708
I'll be doing night shifts for a while.

635
00:36:30,791 --> 00:36:33,291
This way, I'll be able to take Ma to her chemo in the day.

636
00:36:33,375 --> 00:36:35,500
I can't just take the day off when I want.

637
00:36:46,083 --> 00:36:47,583
What are you expecting from her?

638
00:36:51,916 --> 00:36:52,750
Expecting?

639
00:36:54,208 --> 00:36:57,625
My mother has cancer. Don't you think I should support her?

640
00:36:57,708 --> 00:37:00,041
Otherwise, I'll be seen as a terrible daughter.

641
00:37:07,166 --> 00:37:10,500
This is the one and only time we do this. I'm not coming back here.

642
00:37:11,125 --> 00:37:14,875
Don't you remember what the doctor told you about making sure you exercise?

643
00:37:16,625 --> 00:37:18,000
I can walk on my own.

644
00:37:18,958 --> 00:37:21,333
You took a day off of work for this, didn't you?

645
00:37:21,416 --> 00:37:23,541
They'll replace you if you call too often.

646
00:37:26,541 --> 00:37:27,916
Ma won't get fired.

647
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:30,125
She'll be working on the night shift for a while

648
00:37:30,208 --> 00:37:32,333
so she can come to your appointments.

649
00:37:33,125 --> 00:37:34,083
Really?

650
00:37:35,541 --> 00:37:36,708
You work at night now?

651
00:37:38,500 --> 00:37:39,416
Until what time?

652
00:37:41,916 --> 00:37:42,833
What time, Sew?

653
00:37:43,916 --> 00:37:45,083
Until dawn, Grandma.

654
00:37:45,166 --> 00:37:47,208
- She works all night. - [Grandma] Oh.

655
00:37:48,500 --> 00:37:50,416
That means you haven't even slept yet?

656
00:37:51,333 --> 00:37:53,125
That's enough. Get me out of here.

657
00:37:53,708 --> 00:37:55,708
We're here now. Stay.

658
00:37:56,416 --> 00:37:59,166
Why can't you let me do something nice for you for once?

659
00:37:59,833 --> 00:38:03,208
Because whenever I let you do things like that, it always backfires.

660
00:38:03,291 --> 00:38:06,625
Like when you dropped out of school to help me sell congee.

661
00:38:07,291 --> 00:38:09,291
Why are you saying that was bad?

662
00:38:09,375 --> 00:38:12,416
I couldn't bear to see you work so hard while my brothers did nothing.

663
00:38:12,500 --> 00:38:14,208
You broke your back for all of us,

664
00:38:14,291 --> 00:38:16,125
working all those long hours with your cart.

665
00:38:16,208 --> 00:38:18,583
You work harder than me, and look where it got you.

666
00:38:18,666 --> 00:38:20,208
- Tired and wet. - If Kiang were available,

667
00:38:20,291 --> 00:38:21,750
you'd be okay to come with him.

668
00:38:21,833 --> 00:38:23,875
Oh. Right.

669
00:38:23,958 --> 00:38:25,583
I'll make sure he knows that.

670
00:38:25,666 --> 00:38:27,875
I'm not sure he'll be free, but I'll give him the message.

671
00:38:31,041 --> 00:38:32,125
[Grandma groans]

672
00:38:45,541 --> 00:38:47,458
Grandma's crying in the changing room.

673
00:38:50,875 --> 00:38:52,041
That's impossible.

674
00:38:52,583 --> 00:38:55,208
That woman's never shed a tear for me in her life.

675
00:39:00,541 --> 00:39:01,375
[M] True.

676
00:39:02,166 --> 00:39:04,291
You're always the one who sheds the tears.

677
00:39:07,458 --> 00:39:10,041
All I know is the more you bicker, the worse she is.

678
00:39:15,291 --> 00:39:17,625
I'll take Grandma in for her chemo from now on.

679
00:39:19,500 --> 00:39:21,208
I'll be representing our family.

680
00:39:24,625 --> 00:39:26,708
[somber piano music playing]

681
00:39:30,833 --> 00:39:32,833
- [crickets chirping] - [exotic bird calls]

682
00:39:34,291 --> 00:39:36,375
{\an8}[Grandma] Did you turn off the lights in the house?

683
00:39:36,458 --> 00:39:38,083
{\an8}- [M] Yes. - [Grandma] Upstairs and down?

684
00:39:38,166 --> 00:39:39,000
{\an8}[M] Yup.

685
00:39:42,208 --> 00:39:43,041
Mui.

686
00:39:44,041 --> 00:39:44,875
Grandma,

687
00:39:45,541 --> 00:39:46,458
this is Mui.

688
00:39:46,541 --> 00:39:47,666
One of my cousins.

689
00:39:47,750 --> 00:39:49,458
[in Teochew] Grandma, have you eaten?

690
00:39:49,541 --> 00:39:50,416
Yes, thank you.

691
00:39:53,125 --> 00:39:54,625
Where are you going, Grandma?

692
00:39:56,958 --> 00:39:58,666
I'm going to see the doctor.

693
00:40:03,375 --> 00:40:05,375
I'm going to drive you there.

694
00:40:06,375 --> 00:40:07,666
Thank you.

695
00:40:11,583 --> 00:40:13,166
[in English] You speak Teochew?

696
00:40:14,958 --> 00:40:15,875
You suck-up.

697
00:40:17,416 --> 00:40:19,416
You owe me one, M. I'm not a taxi.

698
00:40:19,500 --> 00:40:20,916
Yeah, I got it.

699
00:40:22,666 --> 00:40:24,375
[indistinct chatter]

700
00:40:28,333 --> 00:40:30,666
You need to put your shoes at the end of the line, M.

701
00:40:30,750 --> 00:40:32,458
They'll start calling patients at eight.

702
00:40:33,958 --> 00:40:35,916
We woke up at four for this?

703
00:40:36,666 --> 00:40:38,375
Grandma and I will go find a seat.

704
00:40:42,333 --> 00:40:45,000
Wait for me here, Grandma. I'll find you a wheelchair.

705
00:40:46,666 --> 00:40:48,666
[slow staccato piano music playing]

706
00:41:21,583 --> 00:41:23,041
[metallic clattering]

707
00:41:24,916 --> 00:41:25,958
[sighs]

708
00:41:29,250 --> 00:41:31,291
Next time, go in and keep her company.

709
00:41:33,958 --> 00:41:35,583
You'll get huge brownie points.

710
00:41:41,500 --> 00:41:43,958
[light piano music playing]

711
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:54,333
[Grandma groans softly] My insides feel like they're on fire.

712
00:41:54,416 --> 00:41:56,333
Hmm, goodness.

713
00:41:56,416 --> 00:41:58,500
Go put this in the cabinet with the rest.

714
00:41:58,583 --> 00:41:59,416
Sure.

715
00:42:10,833 --> 00:42:13,541
- Hey! No, wait for me to help you. - Not a chance.

716
00:42:14,041 --> 00:42:16,916
When you were a kid, you offered to let me hold your hand.

717
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:19,916
But your eyes were glued to the television,

718
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:21,750
and I banged up my shins.

719
00:42:23,208 --> 00:42:24,708
I don't remember that.

720
00:42:24,791 --> 00:42:27,416
- [Grandma] I'd rather climb on my own. - Come on.

721
00:42:27,500 --> 00:42:28,750
Hold out both your hands.

722
00:42:29,583 --> 00:42:31,500
Mui said I'm supposed to lead the way.

723
00:42:31,583 --> 00:42:33,416
That way, we're sure you won't tumble backwards.

724
00:42:33,500 --> 00:42:35,416
- She said that, did she? - [M] She did.

725
00:42:35,500 --> 00:42:38,083
- Come on. Hands up. - Eyes on me, then.

726
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:48,250
Careful where you step.

727
00:42:50,458 --> 00:42:51,666
[Grandma sighs]

728
00:42:51,750 --> 00:42:53,833
That's good. Now get some rest.

729
00:42:55,250 --> 00:42:56,333
[M sighs]

730
00:43:01,166 --> 00:43:02,416
Is this Uncle Soei?

731
00:43:03,416 --> 00:43:04,291
Uh-huh.

732
00:43:05,458 --> 00:43:06,500
[scoffs]

733
00:43:07,250 --> 00:43:08,500
[M, chuckling] Hilarious.

734
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:19,833
Hey.

735
00:43:21,625 --> 00:43:24,666
You and Grandpa were pretty cool. You look like you were having fun.

736
00:43:24,750 --> 00:43:25,708
[Grandma] Mm-hmm.

737
00:43:26,791 --> 00:43:28,541
Back when you used to live here,

738
00:43:29,208 --> 00:43:30,916
you were afraid of ghosts.

739
00:43:31,833 --> 00:43:35,666
You would squeeze in right here, between your Grandpa and me every night.

740
00:43:35,750 --> 00:43:38,458
- [M] I was afraid of ghosts? - [Grandma] Something awful.

741
00:43:38,541 --> 00:43:41,291
I had to sing you at least three lullabies to get you to sleep.

742
00:43:41,375 --> 00:43:43,166
Hmm? No way.

743
00:43:43,250 --> 00:43:45,041
Hopefully, you outgrew all that.

744
00:43:46,875 --> 00:43:47,958
Because your Grandpa

745
00:43:48,666 --> 00:43:52,041
likes to come back and wander around downstairs every night.

746
00:43:52,750 --> 00:43:54,125
If you see his ghost,

747
00:43:54,666 --> 00:43:56,000
don't say anything to him.

748
00:43:57,083 --> 00:43:59,083
[dramatic piano music playing]

749
00:44:10,041 --> 00:44:11,750
- [ominous notes play loudly] - Shit!

750
00:44:14,208 --> 00:44:17,083
[Grandma] I thought you said you weren't afraid of ghosts anymore.

751
00:44:17,166 --> 00:44:19,291
I'm not afraid of ghosts. But you're real.

752
00:44:20,500 --> 00:44:21,458
[sighs]

753
00:44:21,541 --> 00:44:23,041
[Grandma] I needed to pray.

754
00:44:28,291 --> 00:44:30,500
I had a dream about my parents.

755
00:44:31,375 --> 00:44:33,916
They came to take me to stay with them.

756
00:44:37,458 --> 00:44:38,291
M?

757
00:44:40,541 --> 00:44:42,041
Do you think I'm about to die?

758
00:44:53,250 --> 00:44:54,083
Grandma.

759
00:44:55,333 --> 00:44:56,833
You worship the goddess.

760
00:44:57,625 --> 00:44:59,500
It's been decades since you ate beef.

761
00:45:00,625 --> 00:45:02,291
Cows should be praying to you.

762
00:45:03,541 --> 00:45:05,625
You've got plenty of life left, I'm sure.

763
00:45:13,500 --> 00:45:14,500
Yeah.

764
00:45:15,541 --> 00:45:16,458
I guess so.

765
00:45:16,541 --> 00:45:17,916
I'll go back upstairs.

766
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:19,916
- No more stairs. - [Grandma] You need your sleep.

767
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:21,916
No stairs. Save your energy.

768
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:23,458
We'll sleep together in here.

769
00:45:24,250 --> 00:45:25,875
Come in. So the bugs don't bite.

770
00:45:38,500 --> 00:45:40,500
You're kinda taking up the whole bed.

771
00:45:40,583 --> 00:45:42,958
- [Grandma] Hmm. - [M] Can you scoot over, Grandma?

772
00:45:46,375 --> 00:45:47,375
[M sighs]

773
00:45:55,916 --> 00:45:57,541
[Grandma speaking Teochew]

774
00:46:00,416 --> 00:46:02,000
[M] Are you insulting me again?

775
00:46:03,041 --> 00:46:04,833
[Grandma] That means I thank you.

776
00:46:05,791 --> 00:46:07,625
Are you sure you're Chinese?

777
00:46:07,708 --> 00:46:09,500
You can't understand a single word.

778
00:46:09,583 --> 00:46:12,250
[M] I'm Chinese-Thai, Grandma. Chinese-Thai.

779
00:46:12,333 --> 00:46:14,458
[Grandma] Whatever. I'm going to sleep now.

780
00:46:14,541 --> 00:46:15,375
[M] Okay.

781
00:46:16,375 --> 00:46:17,291
Good night.

782
00:46:17,375 --> 00:46:19,375
[mellow piano music playing]

783
00:46:24,750 --> 00:46:25,625
Grandma?

784
00:46:25,708 --> 00:46:26,625
Sing to me?

785
00:46:29,041 --> 00:46:31,083
[Grandma] Keep doing this whenever you're free.

786
00:46:31,166 --> 00:46:33,708
[M] Sure thing. But you'll be out of job soon.

787
00:46:33,791 --> 00:46:35,666
[Grandma] You're not doing it tight enough.

788
00:46:35,750 --> 00:46:38,250
I'm leaving some space so the vinegar can breathe.

789
00:46:39,375 --> 00:46:40,541
[chuckles]

790
00:46:42,833 --> 00:46:44,458
[woman] The counter is now open.

791
00:46:44,541 --> 00:46:46,166
[indistinct chatter]

792
00:46:47,916 --> 00:46:48,916
[M] Grandma.

793
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:51,000
Come on. Get up. Get up.

794
00:46:51,083 --> 00:46:53,458
[wistful string music playing]

795
00:46:55,333 --> 00:46:56,541
Are you finished?

796
00:46:57,083 --> 00:46:58,333
[Grandma] Just a second.

797
00:47:02,125 --> 00:47:02,958
Grandma?

798
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:05,333
[Grandma groans]

799
00:47:07,541 --> 00:47:08,375
Hey.

800
00:47:09,500 --> 00:47:10,625
What's wrong?

801
00:47:12,083 --> 00:47:13,541
- [moaning] - Are you in pain?

802
00:47:15,708 --> 00:47:16,791
No, no. Not so fast.

803
00:47:18,458 --> 00:47:19,291
One…

804
00:47:22,083 --> 00:47:23,833
Let's skip the market this morning.

805
00:47:25,291 --> 00:47:27,333
I'm gonna give you a sponge bath. You're too warm.

806
00:47:27,416 --> 00:47:29,125
I have to sell my congee.

807
00:47:29,750 --> 00:47:30,916
Come on up. Bath time.

808
00:47:31,833 --> 00:47:33,166
We'll turn around. Slowly.

809
00:47:33,666 --> 00:47:34,625
Go on three.

810
00:47:35,291 --> 00:47:37,541
- One, two, three. Up! - [Grandma moans softly]

811
00:47:38,875 --> 00:47:40,750
[gas hissing]

812
00:47:43,875 --> 00:47:45,375
- [flames flump] - [M gasps]

813
00:47:54,041 --> 00:47:55,625
[M] All right. Arm.

814
00:47:57,750 --> 00:48:00,083
[rooster caws]

815
00:48:01,291 --> 00:48:02,291
[Grandma sighs]

816
00:48:03,500 --> 00:48:05,083
You need to get underneath too.

817
00:48:05,166 --> 00:48:07,375
- I'm sticky. - Whoa! You're taking it off?

818
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:10,666
Mm, I want to feel really clean everywhere.

819
00:48:11,416 --> 00:48:13,416
I'm old, you know. I'm not embarrassed.

820
00:48:14,416 --> 00:48:16,791
[M] Just give me a second. I've never done this.

821
00:48:17,291 --> 00:48:18,583
Give a guy some warning.

822
00:48:21,250 --> 00:48:22,375
[M groans]

823
00:48:22,458 --> 00:48:24,458
[rooster caws]

824
00:48:25,375 --> 00:48:26,500
[M groaning]

825
00:48:28,125 --> 00:48:29,625
[Grandma] What's with your moaning?

826
00:48:30,125 --> 00:48:31,000
Shit!

827
00:48:31,625 --> 00:48:33,458
What? Did you see another ghost?

828
00:48:34,208 --> 00:48:35,916
Was that bump I felt your nipple?

829
00:48:37,208 --> 00:48:38,250
Are you that dumb?

830
00:48:38,333 --> 00:48:39,541
I've got a mole.

831
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:43,625
Who has boobs that would sag all the way down there?

832
00:48:43,708 --> 00:48:45,375
I don't know. H-How would I know?

833
00:48:45,458 --> 00:48:48,041
Give me that. You might think my knees are my boobs.

834
00:48:49,208 --> 00:48:51,083
[camera whirring]

835
00:48:52,125 --> 00:48:53,416
[Grandma] What's with the camera?

836
00:48:54,208 --> 00:48:55,458
It's for watching things.

837
00:48:56,208 --> 00:48:57,458
I can't watch that.

838
00:48:58,041 --> 00:48:59,375
No, I mean watching you.

839
00:48:59,458 --> 00:49:01,583
If you fall or faint, I'll see it.

840
00:49:02,166 --> 00:49:03,333
I could come and help.

841
00:49:03,416 --> 00:49:06,250
If anything bad happens to you, I can see it right away.

842
00:49:06,875 --> 00:49:07,958
Don't jinx me.

843
00:49:08,500 --> 00:49:09,541
Don't worry.

844
00:49:09,625 --> 00:49:10,708
Here. Check this out.

845
00:49:16,458 --> 00:49:17,291
No!

846
00:49:18,416 --> 00:49:20,291
You can't move the goddess like that.

847
00:49:20,791 --> 00:49:21,625
Never.

848
00:49:21,708 --> 00:49:23,291
- Why not? - It's just wrong.

849
00:49:24,833 --> 00:49:26,458
Put her back and apologize.

850
00:49:27,083 --> 00:49:28,208
Right this instant.

851
00:49:28,291 --> 00:49:30,875
You can't shove her around. Where's your respect, M?

852
00:49:31,916 --> 00:49:34,083
- There. - No. Like you care. That was sloppy.

853
00:49:34,166 --> 00:49:35,083
She's all crooked.

854
00:49:35,166 --> 00:49:37,000
Use both your hands, gently.

855
00:49:37,083 --> 00:49:39,166
Yes. Very gently.

856
00:49:39,250 --> 00:49:40,666
- Carefully. - Done. She's all set.

857
00:49:40,750 --> 00:49:43,583
Right back in the same exact spot. It's like she never moved at all.

858
00:49:43,666 --> 00:49:45,875
[low-key piano music playing]

859
00:49:45,958 --> 00:49:48,083
[rain pattering]

860
00:49:50,375 --> 00:49:51,416
[grunts]

861
00:49:52,041 --> 00:49:55,166
[Soei] All done. Easy-peasy. The throne is secure.

862
00:49:57,125 --> 00:49:58,125
You're done?

863
00:49:58,791 --> 00:50:00,916
[Soei] Ma, move away. You hate the smell of smoke.

864
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:02,208
You should be resting.

865
00:50:16,833 --> 00:50:17,666
Whoa.

866
00:50:19,500 --> 00:50:21,875
Hey, Ma, the pomegranate's looking nice.

867
00:50:21,958 --> 00:50:23,916
- Can I? - Don't touch it. It's not yours.

868
00:50:24,500 --> 00:50:25,916
It looks too good. I'm taking it.

869
00:50:26,458 --> 00:50:28,666
- [Grandma] You can't have it. - Why not?

870
00:50:28,750 --> 00:50:30,791
- Ooh! - It's not yours.

871
00:50:31,291 --> 00:50:32,916
Well, whose is it?

872
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:34,875
[Grandma] It's not yours, that's all.

873
00:50:35,541 --> 00:50:36,875
[chuckles] Ah.

874
00:50:36,958 --> 00:50:39,250
- [Grandma] What? - You're saving it for your favorite son,

875
00:50:39,333 --> 00:50:40,833
Mr. Money Bags.

876
00:50:41,916 --> 00:50:43,250
You have something to eat?

877
00:50:43,833 --> 00:50:44,958
[Grandma] Take a look.

878
00:50:45,583 --> 00:50:46,708
[Soei] Mm.

879
00:50:47,458 --> 00:50:48,583
Hmm.

880
00:50:50,166 --> 00:50:53,375
Hey, M, did you know that when they first met,

881
00:50:53,916 --> 00:50:56,125
Ma thought Kiang's wife was a real dud?

882
00:50:57,541 --> 00:50:58,916
[M] What do you mean a dud?

883
00:51:01,208 --> 00:51:02,208
Shit.

884
00:51:02,708 --> 00:51:05,916
You make me explain the simplest words. Did you sleep through school? Huh?

885
00:51:06,416 --> 00:51:07,541
A dud sucks.

886
00:51:07,625 --> 00:51:10,333
Like a firecracker that got all wet, or a total bore.

887
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:12,666
- [M] Ah. - [laughs]

888
00:51:13,583 --> 00:51:15,708
When Pinn got her hooks into your uncle,

889
00:51:15,791 --> 00:51:18,583
Kiang changed into a totally different person.

890
00:51:19,541 --> 00:51:20,625
He became a snob.

891
00:51:21,375 --> 00:51:22,791
All about image.

892
00:51:22,875 --> 00:51:25,208
Sending his kid to an international school.

893
00:51:25,291 --> 00:51:27,750
Shut your mouth, Soei. I can tell when you've been drinking.

894
00:51:27,833 --> 00:51:29,958
- [Soei] He borrowed tons of money. - You have no filter.

895
00:51:30,041 --> 00:51:31,791
[Soei] I haven't finished gossiping yet.

896
00:51:33,208 --> 00:51:34,541
She protects her favorite.

897
00:51:36,041 --> 00:51:37,375
Fine, I'll shut my mouth.

898
00:51:39,333 --> 00:51:43,291
{\an8}Anyway, my motto's always been, "Live within your means and be modest."

899
00:51:43,375 --> 00:51:46,375
- But your favorite, he hoards it away. - That's enough from you.

900
00:51:46,458 --> 00:51:49,541
The guy's loaded, but when people like me need a little handout, where is he?

901
00:51:49,625 --> 00:51:50,750
Huh?

902
00:51:51,375 --> 00:51:52,916
I'm short about a thousand. Help me out?

903
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:54,041
- Hmm? - No way.

904
00:51:54,125 --> 00:51:55,500
- Please? - I spent it.

905
00:51:55,583 --> 00:51:57,000
- If I find it, can I have it? - No.

906
00:51:57,083 --> 00:51:58,375
- Come on. - [groans]

907
00:51:58,458 --> 00:51:59,708
Hmm? Wild.

908
00:51:59,791 --> 00:52:01,625
- Not today, Soei. - I'll kiss you 'til you cave.

909
00:52:01,708 --> 00:52:02,625
Hmm, hmm, hmm?

910
00:52:10,041 --> 00:52:10,916
[Grandma] With Soei,

911
00:52:11,541 --> 00:52:13,000
it's best when he stays away.

912
00:52:14,375 --> 00:52:15,291
Why's that?

913
00:52:17,166 --> 00:52:20,166
Because it means that he's okay when he doesn't come around.

914
00:52:20,666 --> 00:52:22,166
[gentle music playing]

915
00:52:26,375 --> 00:52:27,958
[Mui] That's just how it goes.

916
00:52:28,458 --> 00:52:30,125
Her kids versus her grandkids.

917
00:52:30,666 --> 00:52:33,750
- She's loved them a lot longer. - [woman] There's a charge for extra sauce.

918
00:52:34,333 --> 00:52:36,166
Can you rate your current position?

919
00:52:36,250 --> 00:52:37,875
Who's your Grandma's favorite?

920
00:52:40,083 --> 00:52:42,833
The number one spot is either Uncle Kiang or Uncle Soei.

921
00:52:43,375 --> 00:52:45,625
One's too serious, and the other's a clown.

922
00:52:46,250 --> 00:52:48,208
I think I've moved ahead of my mom, though.

923
00:52:49,500 --> 00:52:51,291
Number three gets a big zero.

924
00:52:55,541 --> 00:52:56,541
What about you?

925
00:52:56,625 --> 00:52:59,000
How did you know you were top of the list? Did he tell you?

926
00:52:59,083 --> 00:53:01,333
Most older people aren't that straightforward.

927
00:53:02,875 --> 00:53:04,208
But you can feel it.

928
00:53:06,833 --> 00:53:07,750
Feel what?

929
00:53:08,333 --> 00:53:10,250
Not the love, if that's what you mean.

930
00:53:10,333 --> 00:53:11,916
I just feel her sarcastic shit.

931
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:13,416
- [blows] - [laughs] Every day.

932
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:18,958
[Mui] Hmm.

933
00:53:23,625 --> 00:53:26,500
I was sure I snagged the spot when Grandpa sang my praises

934
00:53:26,583 --> 00:53:28,041
to the rest of the clan.

935
00:53:28,958 --> 00:53:29,958
Mm, I guess.

936
00:53:31,583 --> 00:53:33,375
[turn signal clicking]

937
00:53:34,708 --> 00:53:36,291
[Kiang] We're almost there, Ma.

938
00:53:37,250 --> 00:53:39,125
It's a bit far, but the air is better.

939
00:53:49,416 --> 00:53:51,583
I'm sorry I haven't brought you here before.

940
00:53:56,125 --> 00:53:57,541
[doorbell chimes]

941
00:53:57,625 --> 00:53:59,791
[Rainbow] Welcome to our house, Grandma.

942
00:53:59,875 --> 00:54:01,208
[Pinn] Welcome, Ma.

943
00:54:02,333 --> 00:54:04,458
Show Grandma the picture you drew for her.

944
00:54:08,125 --> 00:54:09,791
- [Grandma] Hmm. - Careful.

945
00:54:14,500 --> 00:54:16,833
[faint singing over TV]

946
00:54:28,166 --> 00:54:29,541
Do you like it, Grandma?

947
00:54:30,291 --> 00:54:31,208
Very much.

948
00:54:32,083 --> 00:54:33,000
Thank you.

949
00:54:34,250 --> 00:54:37,291
Did you notice the bed? We got it specially for you.

950
00:54:37,375 --> 00:54:39,041
Rainbow chose the red flowers.

951
00:54:39,791 --> 00:54:41,541
The TV's internet cable.

952
00:54:41,625 --> 00:54:43,333
You can watch Chinese opera.

953
00:54:45,916 --> 00:54:47,541
I still have a house and business to run.

954
00:54:47,625 --> 00:54:48,458
Oh, Ma!

955
00:54:48,958 --> 00:54:51,875
Pinn and I want you to sell that house and move in with us.

956
00:54:51,958 --> 00:54:54,166
Besides, there's salons, restaurants, a club.

957
00:54:54,250 --> 00:54:56,916
The club has seniors' activities. There's tai-chi each morning.

958
00:55:03,333 --> 00:55:05,458
What about her chemo appointments, though?

959
00:55:06,208 --> 00:55:07,375
The commute is tiring.

960
00:55:08,833 --> 00:55:12,458
Uh, I run my stock trading from home. I'll be around to take care of her.

961
00:55:12,541 --> 00:55:14,500
Yeah, but there's her congee shop.

962
00:55:14,583 --> 00:55:17,500
Her regulars are wondering why she's not there on Sundays.

963
00:55:17,583 --> 00:55:20,250
I think it's time for Ma to be closed every day, don't you?

964
00:55:20,333 --> 00:55:21,458
And I can support her.

965
00:55:21,958 --> 00:55:24,666
Moving here is best. I can be there for her treatments.

966
00:55:24,750 --> 00:55:26,500
But you're so far from the clinic.

967
00:55:26,583 --> 00:55:29,000
You'll be getting up at two in the morning to make it work.

968
00:55:36,125 --> 00:55:37,375
[Kiang sighs softly]

969
00:55:42,833 --> 00:55:44,000
[zipper rasps]

970
00:55:46,958 --> 00:55:48,458
[papers rustle]

971
00:55:51,375 --> 00:55:52,208
[Kiang] M.

972
00:55:53,541 --> 00:55:54,375
M!

973
00:55:56,333 --> 00:55:57,166
Yep?

974
00:55:57,250 --> 00:55:59,333
I appreciate the work you've been putting in.

975
00:55:59,416 --> 00:56:00,250
And so,

976
00:56:00,750 --> 00:56:03,833
I wanted to give you a little something for taking care of Grandma for us.

977
00:56:08,583 --> 00:56:09,958
That's nice of you, Uncle.

978
00:56:10,041 --> 00:56:11,916
But I'm not in it for the money.

979
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:13,541
So it wouldn't feel right.

980
00:56:28,583 --> 00:56:29,625
[Kiang] Ma.

981
00:56:29,708 --> 00:56:32,791
You raised your son right. I will take care of my mother.

982
00:56:33,541 --> 00:56:35,541
I can't burden my nephew with your care.

983
00:56:38,333 --> 00:56:40,333
[laid-back piano music playing]

984
00:56:43,500 --> 00:56:44,333
And.

985
00:56:45,625 --> 00:56:47,458
Let me do what a son should.

986
00:57:04,750 --> 00:57:06,083
[train horn blows]

987
00:57:11,208 --> 00:57:13,125
And you locked everything up?

988
00:57:13,208 --> 00:57:14,291
Of course.

989
00:57:17,791 --> 00:57:18,708
Rainbow.

990
00:57:19,250 --> 00:57:20,541
It's big-girl time.

991
00:57:20,625 --> 00:57:22,750
Please go ask Grandma if she's having fun.

992
00:57:22,833 --> 00:57:24,625
I'm sure she would like you to sit with her.

993
00:57:24,708 --> 00:57:26,083
- Can you do that? - Okay.

994
00:57:26,166 --> 00:57:27,541
Ah!

995
00:57:28,791 --> 00:57:31,291
- [Rainbow] Do you like the train, Grandma? - I love the train.

996
00:57:31,375 --> 00:57:33,833
- I like riding places, don't you? - [Rainbow] It's so much fun!

997
00:57:35,500 --> 00:57:37,291
Such a smart, pretty granddaughter.

998
00:57:37,375 --> 00:57:39,791
You can make coffin donations at this temple.

999
00:57:39,875 --> 00:57:41,250
We'll contribute for you.

1000
00:57:41,833 --> 00:57:43,875
Rainbow's friend and her mother came recently.

1001
00:57:43,958 --> 00:57:45,875
And her condition improved in no time.

1002
00:57:46,833 --> 00:57:48,583
You know what this reminds me of, Ma?

1003
00:57:48,666 --> 00:57:50,333
Taking the train when we were kids.

1004
00:57:50,416 --> 00:57:53,125
It brings back memories of when you and Pa took us on trips.

1005
00:57:53,208 --> 00:57:54,916
And you were so tiny for your age.

1006
00:57:55,000 --> 00:57:56,416
- [Kiang] Me? - Puny, but quick.

1007
00:57:57,000 --> 00:58:00,083
- [Kiang] I remember Soei running all over. - Of course. All three of you did.

1008
00:58:00,166 --> 00:58:01,458
[Kiang laughs]

1009
00:58:02,833 --> 00:58:04,708
[automated voice] May you all be blessed

1010
00:58:04,791 --> 00:58:07,333
- for coming to visit our temple today. - [Grandma] Seven.

1011
00:58:08,875 --> 00:58:11,041
- Eight. - We invite you to fill out…

1012
00:58:11,750 --> 00:58:12,583
Nine.

1013
00:58:13,458 --> 00:58:15,625
- [Kiang] Ma, are you good to climb up? - [Grandma] Ten.

1014
00:58:16,250 --> 00:58:17,916
- Eleven. - You can go ahead, Uncle.

1015
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:19,166
We'll catch up to you.

1016
00:58:19,250 --> 00:58:20,666
[Grandma] Twelve.

1017
00:58:23,083 --> 00:58:25,125
- Thirteen. - [M] So have you made up your mind yet?

1018
00:58:25,208 --> 00:58:27,000
Are you gonna move in with Kiang?

1019
00:58:27,083 --> 00:58:28,541
[Grandma] Be quiet, will you?

1020
00:58:29,041 --> 00:58:31,166
I'm counting the steps. You'll mess me up.

1021
00:58:31,666 --> 00:58:34,333
- [M] Why are you counting? - [Grandma] For the lottery.

1022
00:58:39,166 --> 00:58:41,250
[M] Hmm. Do your feet hurt?

1023
00:58:42,166 --> 00:58:43,541
Take a break.

1024
00:58:43,625 --> 00:58:46,875
[Grandma] Back in the day, when Kiang was just a kid,

1025
00:58:46,958 --> 00:58:49,000
we came to offer prayers here.

1026
00:58:50,208 --> 00:58:52,791
When it was time to leave, his shoes were gone.

1027
00:58:54,166 --> 00:58:57,916
So I had to give him my sandals so he didn't go home barefoot.

1028
00:58:58,583 --> 00:59:00,125
It was a gorgeous day.

1029
00:59:00,208 --> 00:59:03,875
Sunny and bright like today. The ground was just as hot as today too.

1030
00:59:03,958 --> 00:59:06,125
Did he buy these to try to make it up to you?

1031
00:59:11,833 --> 00:59:12,791
Hmm.

1032
00:59:12,875 --> 00:59:14,458
[Pinn] Good, Rainbow.

1033
00:59:15,208 --> 00:59:16,166
Perfect.

1034
00:59:16,791 --> 00:59:18,041
- [M] Your name? - Let's go.

1035
00:59:18,125 --> 00:59:21,208
Start it with Missus, then Mengju Saejiew.

1036
00:59:22,208 --> 00:59:24,958
We're gonna put up our labels and then wait for you outside.

1037
00:59:27,041 --> 00:59:29,041
- Your wish? - I want to regain my health.

1038
00:59:32,958 --> 00:59:34,625
- Okay. - I have more.

1039
00:59:34,708 --> 00:59:36,333
You can't rush the wishes, you know.

1040
00:59:36,416 --> 00:59:37,666
- Uh… - Write.

1041
00:59:37,750 --> 00:59:39,250
[laughs] How many do you have?

1042
00:59:39,333 --> 00:59:41,000
[Grandma] I wish for my

1043
00:59:41,583 --> 00:59:42,791
eldest son…

1044
00:59:47,500 --> 00:59:48,791
my daughter…

1045
00:59:51,916 --> 00:59:53,666
and my youngest son…

1046
00:59:57,333 --> 00:59:59,291
to be healthy and strong.

1047
01:00:01,583 --> 01:00:03,958
- And have money and gold. - [M sighs]

1048
01:00:04,041 --> 01:00:05,958
Any more and we'll need another label.

1049
01:00:06,041 --> 01:00:08,875
[Grandma] Only because your letters are big as elephants.

1050
01:00:09,708 --> 01:00:10,583
[M] Hmm.

1051
01:00:10,666 --> 01:00:14,583
[Grandma] And I ask for my one and only grandson…

1052
01:00:25,583 --> 01:00:27,750
to have a very good job.

1053
01:00:37,083 --> 01:00:38,250
All right.

1054
01:00:38,333 --> 01:00:39,291
I'll put it up.

1055
01:00:39,791 --> 01:00:40,791
[Grandma] Thank you.

1056
01:00:49,291 --> 01:00:50,375
[M] Look, Grandma.

1057
01:00:50,458 --> 01:00:51,458
One.

1058
01:00:52,791 --> 01:00:53,750
Two.

1059
01:00:56,666 --> 01:00:57,500
Three.

1060
01:00:59,166 --> 01:01:00,541
Nobody made wishes for you.

1061
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:04,625
Seems that Kiang's only pretending how much he cares.

1062
01:01:04,708 --> 01:01:06,833
It's all an act to get on your good side.

1063
01:01:09,416 --> 01:01:11,208
He has a family of his own.

1064
01:01:11,291 --> 01:01:13,875
He has to use his wishes for their happiness first.

Can you try to have your things ready to move by next Sunday?

I'll arrange your transportation.

[Grandma] M, wait.

1075
01:03:03,916 --> 01:03:05,791
I want to buy some new shoes today.

1076
01:03:07,458 --> 01:03:09,125
These hurt my feet too much.

1077
01:03:24,833 --> 01:03:26,000
Here. Start with these.

1078
01:03:32,333 --> 01:03:33,166
How are they?

1079
01:03:33,250 --> 01:03:34,416
They feel big.

1080
01:03:34,916 --> 01:03:36,583
- They feel big? - Yes.

1081
01:03:36,666 --> 01:03:37,500
Hmm.

1082
01:03:38,208 --> 01:03:41,208
Honestly, you might get that perfect fit after all.

Hey, M.

1084
01:03:43,416 --> 01:03:44,416
Uh-huh?

1085
01:03:45,041 --> 01:03:47,666
Maybe you're just trying to get on my good side too, huh?

1086
01:03:55,875 --> 01:03:56,875
It's the same

1087

as Kiang, in a way.

1088

"Oh, you're so full of it."

1092
01:04:14,083 --> 01:04:15,583
I'm telling the truth, though.

1093
01:04:16,708 --> 01:04:18,208
I say we try these next.

1120
01:06:29,750 --> 01:06:33,208
- You said you wanted only pork. - [Grandma] I meant give me a lot of pork.

Fine. Lots of pork.

During the ghost festival and on Chinese New Year,

1150

we didn't know what else to do once we'd observed the rituals.

1151
01:07:57,125 --> 01:07:59,375
So we'd play cards late into the evening.

1152
01:08:01,833 --> 01:08:04,750
You've lived alone for a long time. Do you ever get lonely?

1153

I wouldn't call it loneliness. It's part of life's process.

Then please put all the food away in the cabinet

01:13:38,333 --> 01:13:39,333
I'll go see.

1237

[man] Hello? Hello?

1238
01:13:50,958 --> 01:13:52,916
It must be someone Soei owes money to.

1239
01:13:53,000 --> 01:13:54,000
Hide somewhere.

1240
01:13:55,000 --> 01:13:56,000
I'll get rid of him.

1241
01:13:58,541 --> 01:13:59,833
[laughs] Hello, ma'am.

1242
01:13:59,916 --> 01:14:02,166
If you're looking for Soei, you're too late.

1243
01:14:02,250 --> 01:14:03,791
He's been ordained as a monk.

1244
01:14:03,875 --> 01:14:07,458
I'm just a humble housekeeper, and I'm not supposed to let anyone in.

1245
01:14:07,541 --> 01:14:10,541
Oh, well, I'm not looking for anyone named Soei, ma'am.

1246
01:14:10,625 --> 01:14:12,250
- Oh? - I'm here about the listing

1247
01:14:12,333 --> 01:14:13,833
I saw for this place.

1248
01:14:13,916 --> 01:14:16,791
I texted the seller, but he never replied to my message.

1249
01:14:16,875 --> 01:14:18,583
Uh, so I thought I'd drop by.

1250
01:14:19,416 --> 01:14:20,833
Oh, oh, thank you so much.

1251
01:14:21,916 --> 01:14:23,833
This house isn't for sale, sir.

1252
01:14:23,916 --> 01:14:25,791
- No. - Here's the internet post.

1253
01:14:26,625 --> 01:14:29,208
The seller is listed as M Thanapat, ma'am.

1254
01:14:29,291 --> 01:14:31,250
I don't suppose you recognize the name?

1255
01:14:33,833 --> 01:14:36,375
Mm, I don't believe I know that person.

1256
01:14:36,458 --> 01:14:37,291

Is he gone?

1260
01:14:53,416 --> 01:14:54,916
How'd you get him to go away?

1261
01:14:55,708 --> 01:14:57,833
Hmm, I told him I'm the maid.

1262
01:14:58,541 --> 01:14:59,541
[laughs]

1263
01:15:00,375 --> 01:15:02,708
Well, you can pull it off. You have the outfit.

1264
01:15:03,916 --> 01:15:04,958
And the scowl.

1265
01:15:09,291 --> 01:15:12,083
Now get to work, you silly maid. Enough sitting around.

[Grandma] I bought you a new shirt.

1268
01:15:34,541 --> 01:15:35,500
It looks formal.

1269
01:15:35,583 --> 01:15:37,166
So you can look professional.

1270
01:15:38,625 --> 01:15:39,750
I don't know.

1271
01:15:40,666 --> 01:15:42,083
It's kind of old-fashioned.

1272
01:15:42,166 --> 01:15:43,000
[Grandma] Hmm.

1273
01:15:44,375 --> 01:15:45,250
You know,

1274
01:15:45,333 --> 01:15:48,291
I think the next chemo treatment could be the last one.

1275
01:15:48,375 --> 01:15:49,583
And then I'll be cured.

1276
01:15:50,375 --> 01:15:53,000
Then you won't be stuck here doing all of this.

When you were in elementary school,

people could see your potential.

1281
01:16:10,375 --> 01:16:12,666
You can do anything, but you have to try.

Huh?

1283
01:16:15,500 --> 01:16:17,916
Put in the effort and find yourself a proper job.

When I told you it was yours,

1294

I'd keep it all for you.

you basically got everything they owned.

You got several million for the house.

Why am I not entitled to something?

then my children will be prosperous.

or become part of the stratosphere.

Uncle Kiang might pay someone to do the ritual.

You don't need any more chemo.

1395
01:24:38,250 --> 01:24:41,375
You told us that the chemotherapy would get rid of the cancer.

Is it possible that the results are wrong?

1400

is to spend as much time as you can with her.

01:24:59,208 --> 01:25:01,291

Ma, what did she say?

1411
01:25:35,875 --> 01:25:37,041
[cries]

1412
01:25:39,708 --> 01:25:41,083
What did she tell you, Ma?

1413
01:25:41,750 --> 01:25:42,833
[sniffling]

1414
01:25:47,625 --> 01:25:49,833
"The rice grains have become cooked rice."

1415
01:25:51,625 --> 01:25:54,291
It's a saying that means accept what can't be changed.

1416
01:25:54,375 --> 01:25:55,916
[somber music playing]

1417
01:25:58,375 --> 01:25:59,833
[Sew crying]

1418
01:26:18,916 --> 01:26:20,541
[Sew whimpering]

1419
01:26:23,916 --> 01:26:25,500
[Grandma, sobbing] Baba. Ma.

1420
01:26:28,041 --> 01:26:31,208
{\an8}Come and take me with you. It hurts too much.

1421
01:26:31,291 --> 01:26:32,708
[whimpering]

1422
01:26:33,916 --> 01:26:37,208
I want to join you and Grandma and the others.

1423
01:26:37,291 --> 01:26:39,291
[wheezing and sobbing]

1424
01:26:40,583 --> 01:26:42,000
Shh.

1425
01:26:44,541 --> 01:26:46,791
I want to die.

1426
01:26:47,958 --> 01:26:49,833
I want to die.

1427
01:26:54,583 --> 01:26:55,708
Grandpa.

1428
01:26:56,541 --> 01:26:58,791
Help me.

1429
01:27:02,458 --> 01:27:03,833
[M grunts]

1430
01:27:07,916 --> 01:27:09,333
[pen scratching]

1431
01:27:12,291 --> 01:27:13,208
Hey.

1432
01:27:13,291 --> 01:27:14,458
Is Ma getting worse?

1433
01:27:15,666 --> 01:27:19,166
They'll be running some tests. If there's nothing new, she can go home.

1434
01:27:21,833 --> 01:27:23,416
- Huh? - [Sew] Get up.

1435
01:27:24,375 --> 01:27:25,500
[Soei grunts]

1436
01:27:29,708 --> 01:27:31,250
Let's talk outside for a minute, Sew.

1437
01:27:42,000 --> 01:27:43,875
Do you know where the deed to her house is?

1438
01:27:46,916 --> 01:27:48,666
She hasn't been buried yet, Kiang.

1439
01:27:49,875 --> 01:27:52,375
Ma's not dead. Why are you asking about her house?

1440
01:27:53,208 --> 01:27:54,416
When we have buried her,

1441
01:27:54,500 --> 01:27:56,166
someone's going to have to take care of it.

1442
01:27:56,250 --> 01:27:58,750
If we do it while Ma's alive, it'll be much easier.

1443
01:28:05,125 --> 01:28:06,916
Pinn put you up to this business, right?

1444
01:28:08,000 --> 01:28:09,041
[sighs]

1445
01:28:10,875 --> 01:28:13,708
This is precisely why I don't want to be around you guys.

1446
01:28:14,875 --> 01:28:17,875
I'm not gonna let my wife be treated like she's not a member of this family.

1447
01:28:21,000 --> 01:28:22,500
Do you know where the deed is?

1448
01:28:24,291 --> 01:28:26,875
She keeps her papers in her bedroom closet.

1449
01:28:37,125 --> 01:28:40,791
Ma, if Uncle Kiang asks her to sign something, don't let her do it.

1450
01:28:41,458 --> 01:28:42,333
And!

1451
01:28:43,833 --> 01:28:45,083
Are you listening to me?

1452
01:28:46,333 --> 01:28:47,250
And!

1453
01:28:51,791 --> 01:28:53,250
You better do this now, Soei.

1454
01:28:56,000 --> 01:28:57,208
You're the best, sis.

1455
01:29:04,666 --> 01:29:06,541
Grandma gave her house to your uncle.

1456
01:29:11,791 --> 01:29:13,791
[somber music playing]

1457
01:29:16,500 --> 01:29:17,708
[monitor beeping]

1458
01:29:17,791 --> 01:29:19,041
[door opens]

1459
01:29:22,375 --> 01:29:23,458
[door closes]

1460
01:29:42,125 --> 01:29:43,250
[sighs]

1461
01:29:56,208 --> 01:29:57,750
[cell phone rings]

1462
01:30:01,958 --> 01:30:02,958
Just a second.

1463
01:30:03,041 --> 01:30:05,208
M, I need to go settle the bill.

1464
01:30:06,125 --> 01:30:08,125
Take her over to the taxi line and wait there.

1465
01:30:08,208 --> 01:30:09,125
Let's go.

1466
01:30:10,833 --> 01:30:11,666
M!

1467
01:30:13,208 --> 01:30:14,541
[M sighs]

1468
01:30:24,500 --> 01:30:28,750
PATIENT PICK-UP AND DROP-OFF POINT

1469
01:30:29,875 --> 01:30:32,916
You gave your house to Soei? Haven't you learned your lesson?

1470
01:30:34,875 --> 01:30:37,000
He'll always struggle more than the others.

1471
01:30:38,291 --> 01:30:39,541
Because you enable him.

1472
01:30:40,083 --> 01:30:41,541
That's why he's such a loser.

1473
01:30:48,125 --> 01:30:49,750
Your parents did the same thing.

1474
01:30:50,916 --> 01:30:52,375
Cutting out the caregiver.

1475
01:30:54,416 --> 01:30:56,250
I don't have anything else to give.

1476
01:30:57,250 --> 01:30:59,375
You don't have to look after me anymore.

1477
01:31:01,500 --> 01:31:03,416
I've been doing a good job, haven't I?

1478
01:31:10,625 --> 01:31:12,250
You have done good work.

1479
01:31:15,458 --> 01:31:16,958
Quite impressive, actually.

1480
01:31:20,625 --> 01:31:22,375
How come I'm not gonna be rewarded?

1481
01:31:26,208 --> 01:31:27,583
When I should be first?

1482
01:31:27,666 --> 01:31:29,500
[rain pattering]

1483
01:31:30,875 --> 01:31:32,250
Where do I stand with you?

1484
01:31:36,583 --> 01:31:37,458
Huh?

1485
01:31:40,375 --> 01:31:41,208
Tell me!

1486
01:31:42,166 --> 01:31:43,083
Tell me, Grandma.

1487
01:31:44,125 --> 01:31:45,458
[sobs softly]

1488
01:31:50,958 --> 01:31:52,041
Stubborn fool.

1489
01:31:54,791 --> 01:31:56,666
[thunder rumbles]

1490
01:31:58,250 --> 01:31:59,416
I should be first.

1491
01:32:01,250 --> 01:32:02,875
[footsteps recede]

1492
01:32:14,791 --> 01:32:16,916
[sorrowful music playing]

1493
01:32:59,833 --> 01:33:01,833
[music playing over headphones]

1494
01:33:04,666 --> 01:33:07,416
Die! Die! Die! Die! Your mom's dead!

1495
01:33:09,083 --> 01:33:10,708
You're mine now.

1496
01:33:11,916 --> 01:33:13,458
Have you even been to bed yet?

1497
01:33:13,541 --> 01:33:14,541
And!

1498
01:33:14,625 --> 01:33:16,041
Everyone can hear you.

1499
01:33:16,750 --> 01:33:19,833
Huh? You actually have viewers on at this hour?

1500
01:33:20,625 --> 01:33:23,750
Don't you know that expression, "The early bird gets the worm"?

1501
01:33:24,458 --> 01:33:25,791
Especially if the worm

1502
01:33:27,208 --> 01:33:28,500
is in another time zone.

1503
01:33:40,833 --> 01:33:43,958
The new owner of Grandma's house is going to start renovations.

1504
01:33:44,458 --> 01:33:45,958
Can you go help clean it out?

1505
01:33:46,791 --> 01:33:48,708
{\an8}Everything can just go in the garbage.

1506
01:33:58,041 --> 01:33:58,958
What's that face?

1507
01:33:59,750 --> 01:34:00,958
That's not nice.

1508
01:34:01,041 --> 01:34:03,291
You're almost as bad as your Uncle Kiang.

1509
01:34:04,291 --> 01:34:05,708
You know what he said today?

1510
01:34:05,791 --> 01:34:08,500
That if Ma dies, he won't bother coming to the funeral.

1511
01:34:12,250 --> 01:34:15,916
It really is a blessing that neither of us got Grandma's house.

1512
01:34:17,916 --> 01:34:20,541
My favorite saying is, "It's better to give than to receive."

1513
01:34:20,625 --> 01:34:21,708
And it's true.

1514
01:34:23,750 --> 01:34:25,708
[M] Are you trying to cheer yourself up or what?

1515
01:34:25,791 --> 01:34:26,750
[Sew groans]

1516
01:34:26,833 --> 01:34:28,791
Weren't you hoping for Grandma's house?

1517
01:34:30,375 --> 01:34:32,000
Whatever gave you that idea?

1518
01:34:33,166 --> 01:34:35,875
Come on, why else would you have changed your work schedule

1519
01:34:35,958 --> 01:34:37,416
and gone to all those appointments?

1520
01:34:38,250 --> 01:34:40,041
So that I could be with her.

1521
01:34:47,416 --> 01:34:49,083
The house was a little too quiet

1522
01:34:49,791 --> 01:34:51,375
when you went to Grandma's, M.

1523
01:34:53,583 --> 01:34:54,541
Were you lonely?

1524
01:34:56,625 --> 01:34:57,958
It helped me understand

1525
01:34:58,708 --> 01:35:00,416
how once we had all moved out,

1526
01:35:01,291 --> 01:35:03,125
she must have found that hard.

1527
01:35:05,250 --> 01:35:07,125
[tender piano music playing]

1528
01:35:31,333 --> 01:35:32,375
[woman laughs]

1529
01:35:33,000 --> 01:35:35,208
[woman] Hi. You can bring the car into the garage.

1530
01:35:35,291 --> 01:35:36,958
Your room's waiting for you, Mui.

1531
01:35:37,708 --> 01:35:39,666
- Thank you, Auntie. - [woman] Of course.

1532
01:35:40,458 --> 01:35:42,250
[Mui] Last week, Auntie fainted.

1533
01:35:42,333 --> 01:35:44,583
It turns out something's wrong with her heart.

1534
01:35:44,666 --> 01:35:46,541
So she asked me to come and help her.

1535
01:35:52,583 --> 01:35:54,750
Her only son passed away several years ago.

1536
01:35:55,666 --> 01:35:58,541
And her daughter-in-law and grandkids moved away overseas.

1537
01:36:09,666 --> 01:36:11,083
We could do this as a team.

1538
01:36:12,875 --> 01:36:14,416
I'll be her nurse around here.

1539
01:36:15,708 --> 01:36:17,583
You take her to all her appointments.

1540
01:36:18,708 --> 01:36:20,416
When she makes me her number one,

1541
01:36:21,208 --> 01:36:22,333
I'll give you a share.

1542
01:36:48,916 --> 01:36:51,083
I really thought the house would be yours.

1543
01:36:56,000 --> 01:36:57,583
Grandma told me you worked hard

1544
01:36:58,416 --> 01:36:59,833
and took good care of her.

1545
01:37:16,416 --> 01:37:18,125
Do you ever dream of your grandpa?

1546
01:37:33,291 --> 01:37:34,708
On the day that we lost him…

1547
01:37:38,458 --> 01:37:40,333
he was eating and choked on his food.

1548
01:37:45,333 --> 01:37:46,958
I could have cleared his airway.

1549
01:37:50,625 --> 01:37:51,875
Except I chose not to.

1550
01:37:57,541 --> 01:37:59,666
At the end, he was always asking me…

1551
01:38:02,416 --> 01:38:04,250
to let him join his ancestors.

1552
01:38:12,041 --> 01:38:14,166
So I have to assume he's happy where he is.

1553
01:38:17,208 --> 01:38:19,208
Because he hasn't been in my dreams yet.

1554
01:38:22,625 --> 01:38:24,833
[soft piano music playing]

1555
01:38:48,625 --> 01:38:50,625

[Grandma sighs]

1557
01:39:04,833 --> 01:39:09,916
[Grandma] I humbly pay my respect to the benevolent goddess Guanyin.

1558
01:39:10,791 --> 01:39:13,041
Please deliver me from sorrow and illness.

1559
01:39:16,625 --> 01:39:20,000
[woman on TV] The important thing is to keep up the pace, all right?

1560
01:39:20,083 --> 01:39:23,291
We want the heart rate to be somewhat elevated.

1561
01:39:23,375 --> 01:39:25,166
[laughing]

1562
01:39:35,625 --> 01:39:37,291
[children shouting distantly]

[exotic bird calling]

1564
01:40:11,416 --> 01:40:16,083
NURSING HOME

1565
01:40:18,125 --> 01:40:22,041
[M, on phone] Ma, did you know Uncle Soei didn't take Grandma to live with him?

1566
01:40:22,541 --> 01:40:24,041
He put her in a nursing home.

1567
01:40:25,375 --> 01:40:26,333
I'm gonna go visit her.

1568
01:40:26,416 --> 01:40:28,166
- [woman 1] Hello. - [woman 2] Hello.

1569
01:40:28,250 --> 01:40:30,166
- [woman 1] Nice to see you. - [woman 2] Hi.

1570
01:40:30,666 --> 01:40:32,291
- [woman 3] Hi! - [woman 1] Hello.

1571
01:40:33,291 --> 01:40:34,541
Good afternoon.

1572
01:40:35,166 --> 01:40:36,041
Hello.

1573
01:40:36,125 --> 01:40:38,083
Hello! Are you visiting your family?

1574
01:40:38,666 --> 01:40:39,750
- Hello. - Hi.

1575
01:40:40,375 --> 01:40:41,708
- You have someone here? - Hi.

1576
01:40:41,791 --> 01:40:43,041
Yes, ma'am.

1577
01:40:44,583 --> 01:40:46,708
Mr. Chaiyapon, your nephew's here to visit.

1578
01:40:46,791 --> 01:40:48,791
- [Soei] I'll be right out. - [woman] Enjoy your time.

1579
01:40:59,333 --> 01:41:01,291
She's asleep, so you have to be quiet.

1580
01:41:01,375 --> 01:41:02,375
[M] Mm-hmm.

1581
01:41:08,750 --> 01:41:10,083
I got everything paid off.

1582
01:41:13,500 --> 01:41:15,125
But there's a little left over.

1583
01:41:17,416 --> 01:41:18,583
I want you to have it.

1584
01:41:20,041 --> 01:41:21,291
You can hold on to it.

1585
01:41:21,375 --> 01:41:22,625
Come on. It's for you.
